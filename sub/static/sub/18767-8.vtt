00:04.984 --> 00:06.617
Thank you to Fred and Carrie.
I'm so happy you guys

00:06.719 --> 00:08.252
were able to make it tonight.

00:08.388 --> 00:09.921
Great job, guys.
That was awesome.

00:10.023 --> 00:11.789
Have you ever gone
to see your friend's band

00:11.891 --> 00:14.225
and you just end up
feeling sorry for them?

00:14.327 --> 00:17.094
Sometimes the only person
in the audience is you.

00:17.197 --> 00:18.863
And maybe the band's parents.

00:18.965 --> 00:22.366
Well, now there's a club
especially for this purpose.

00:22.468 --> 00:24.869
CMFB's. Club for my
Friend's Band.

00:24.971 --> 00:27.805
We emulate what
a real club feels like

00:27.907 --> 00:30.408
to really boost the self-esteem
of your friend's band.

00:30.510 --> 00:32.210
<i>We've created a space
that looks crowded</i>

00:32.311 --> 00:34.445
<i>all the time
from the stage.</i>

00:34.547 --> 00:35.880
<i>Flats that move back and forth</i>

00:35.982 --> 00:36.948
<i>that look like a crowd.</i>

00:37.050 --> 00:38.749
<i>Lots of lights, smoke.</i>

00:38.852 --> 00:40.051
Can we dim the lights? Sorry.

00:40.153 --> 00:41.485
<i>The band can hardly see.</i>

00:41.588 --> 00:44.088
<i>But they feel
a really excited crowd.</i>

00:44.157 --> 00:47.892
Give it up, everybody,
for Jake on the bass.

00:51.064 --> 00:52.496
We've got secret hiding coves

00:52.599 --> 00:53.798
where you can have
a conversation

00:53.900 --> 00:55.233
and the band can't see you.

00:55.335 --> 00:57.235
Little computer stations
where I can get online

00:57.337 --> 00:59.337
and charge my phone,
check my email.

00:59.439 --> 01:00.972
Ooh, they just
finished a song.

01:01.074 --> 01:03.140
- Thank you guys so much.
- Yeah.

01:03.243 --> 01:05.576
We love you.
We have one more song for you.

01:05.678 --> 01:07.144
Great!

01:08.781 --> 01:10.348
We have a system
in place to ensure

01:10.450 --> 01:11.682
that your friend's band thinks

01:11.784 --> 01:13.484
they sold a lot of merchandise.

01:13.586 --> 01:17.688
Hey, could I have
one CD, please?

01:19.459 --> 01:20.758
And we'll make sure
everybody knows

01:20.860 --> 01:22.627
about how great the show went.

01:24.297 --> 01:25.930
You're a good friend
and every time

01:26.032 --> 01:28.132
your friend's band plays,
you've gone to the show.

01:28.234 --> 01:30.001
Now, it's an enjoyable
experience.

01:30.103 --> 01:31.802
This is for you.
Don't worry,

01:31.905 --> 01:34.038
the band's gonna feel fine.

♪ oh, yeah ♪

01:37.710 --> 01:40.678
Yeah!

Hey, this isn't that fake
club, CMFB's, is it?

01:43.950 --> 01:47.184
- No! Are you kidding?
- I just bought a t-shirt.

01:47.287 --> 01:48.786
That's in another
part of town.

01:48.888 --> 01:50.888
This is a real, legit club.

01:50.990 --> 01:53.024
Oh, okay, cool.
It is legit. Awesome.

Hey! Little ant.

02:39.105 --> 02:40.738
What are you doing?

02:40.840 --> 02:44.008
Okay.
Go say hi to your friends.

02:44.110 --> 02:46.243
Here you go.

02:50.283 --> 02:52.650
Nina, we're out of jelly.

02:54.554 --> 02:56.787
Oh, man. You're dead.

02:59.525 --> 03:01.726
Ugh, gross.

03:01.828 --> 03:04.261
Lance, come here.
I wanna show you something.

03:04.364 --> 03:06.764
- What are you doing?
- Look, I made, like,

03:06.866 --> 03:09.233
a little amusement park
for the ants.

03:09.335 --> 03:10.935
Just so they could feel welcome.

03:11.037 --> 03:12.370
I even gave them names.

03:12.472 --> 03:15.706
That's Dennis, Frank,
Mike, Rick--

03:15.808 --> 03:17.408
Nina, these ants
are everywhere.

03:17.510 --> 03:20.111
They're driving me crazy.
We need to call an exterminator.

03:20.213 --> 03:22.213
Just don't be annoyed by them.
They're just nature.

03:22.315 --> 03:24.248
- It's just animals.
- I know you love animals,

03:24.350 --> 03:25.816
but these are insects.

03:25.918 --> 03:29.120
What if we had an infestation
of chimpanzees?

03:29.222 --> 03:31.555
That-- that-- those two words
don't really go together.

03:31.657 --> 03:33.924
- Have you been to Africa?
- Ants are pests.

03:34.027 --> 03:36.894
Well can we get, like,
a no-kill exterminator?

03:48.775 --> 03:50.441
- Hi.
- Good morning.

03:50.543 --> 03:52.143
- How are you?
- Hi.

03:52.245 --> 03:53.677
- You're the exterminator?
- Yes, my name's Scout.

03:53.780 --> 03:55.780
And, uh, you guys called
about some ants?

03:55.882 --> 03:57.681
We have an ant problem.
But we wanted something

03:57.784 --> 03:59.316
that doesn't harm the animals.

03:59.419 --> 04:01.986
There's a cat
in the neighborhood.

04:02.088 --> 04:03.821
Absolutely.
This is what I like to call

04:03.923 --> 04:05.256
humane extermination.

04:05.358 --> 04:06.690
We're not looking to
kill any ants.

04:06.793 --> 04:08.959
How do you humanely rid our
house of ants, then?

04:09.062 --> 04:11.429
Well the first thing I like to
do is get a sense of the space.

04:11.531 --> 04:13.631
And then I'll introduce
this guy.

04:13.733 --> 04:16.267
He's what we call an alpha ant.
I call him Coach.

04:16.369 --> 04:18.302
He's gonna encourage these ants
to say, "You know what?

04:18.404 --> 04:20.171
Maybe this place
ain't so great anymore."

04:20.273 --> 04:22.440
And, uh, so they all head,
they all scurry,

04:22.542 --> 04:24.008
they all make new lives
for themselves.

04:24.110 --> 04:26.977
We also introduce
a kombucha blend

04:27.080 --> 04:29.647
- that we brew at our facility.
- Oh.

04:29.749 --> 04:34.351
And it encourages the ants
to seek other holes to live in.

04:34.454 --> 04:37.621
I guess. It's basically
a carrot and stick situation.

04:37.723 --> 04:40.624
His story about the carrot,
he was referring to--

04:40.726 --> 04:43.360
once upon a time, they put
a stick in front of a donkey

04:43.463 --> 04:45.796
but it-- the stick was connected
to the donkey's back.

04:45.898 --> 04:47.531
- And they put a carrot.
- Mm-hmm.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.000
And he tried to follow it to
the ends of the Earth.

04:50.103 --> 04:53.704
And he thought, "Why the
carrot-- why can't the carrot

04:53.806 --> 04:55.072
- go in my mouth?"
- I do have

04:55.174 --> 04:57.141
a pretty full book today,
so if we wanna--

04:57.243 --> 04:59.076
Extermination seems
pretty cut and dry to me.

04:59.178 --> 05:01.579
And I don't wanna be
experimenting.

05:01.681 --> 05:03.481
It's the only humane way
to do it

05:03.583 --> 05:05.883
and I don't wanna think about it
anymore, Lance.

05:05.985 --> 05:07.651
- Okay.
- We agree to do this,

05:07.753 --> 05:08.919
but be careful.

05:08.988 --> 05:10.321
Take off your shoes
if you're gonna

05:10.423 --> 05:11.722
- go near the shelves.
- If you guys wanna

05:11.824 --> 05:13.390
steer clear of me
for just a few hours.

05:13.493 --> 05:15.059
It would be great to have
a little privacy, too.

05:15.161 --> 05:17.261
You need privacy?

05:25.505 --> 05:27.671
Hey, it's Scout.

05:27.773 --> 05:29.240
I'm in.

05:38.484 --> 05:41.752
There are some really
shocking things

05:41.854 --> 05:45.022
in a book I have to
tell you about...

05:45.124 --> 05:48.292
is truly disturbing.

05:48.394 --> 05:49.860
"The Guinness Book
of World Records," yeah,

05:49.962 --> 05:51.529
that comes out every year.

05:51.631 --> 05:53.097
I'm looking through here,
I'm not seeing anything

05:53.232 --> 05:55.533
in Portland and I think we need
to be in this book.

05:55.635 --> 05:57.034
What about most parks?
I thought we had

05:57.136 --> 05:58.402
- the most parks in the US.
- No, Minneapolis

05:58.504 --> 06:00.070
- has the most parks.
- Longest speech.

06:00.173 --> 06:03.274
Yes. I could speak
for a long time.

06:03.376 --> 06:04.909
- Let's not do that.
- What about

06:05.011 --> 06:06.410
world's fastest blinker?

06:06.512 --> 06:08.646
I mean, you can--

06:08.748 --> 06:10.314
- Do it.
- Hard to count.

06:10.383 --> 06:11.582
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

06:11.684 --> 06:14.051
I mean, that's a lot.

06:14.153 --> 06:15.819
You have very fast
blinking ability.

06:15.888 --> 06:17.488
How about
world's biggest tree house?

06:17.590 --> 06:19.490
- Uh, slowest soccer game.
- Yes, but it has to be

06:19.592 --> 06:23.294
a record of some--
some amazing feat.

06:23.396 --> 06:25.329
Sorry, I'm so distracted
by your nails right now.

06:25.431 --> 06:28.566
Oh, yes. I'm working on
a record, myself.

06:28.668 --> 06:31.635
Uh, the mayor with
the longest fingernails

06:31.737 --> 06:33.070
- in the world.
- Don't do that.

06:33.172 --> 06:34.238
Yeah, it's not easy.

06:34.340 --> 06:35.506
And it's not easy on the eyes.

06:35.608 --> 06:37.107
No, and it takes a very,

06:37.210 --> 06:39.810
very, very long time.

06:39.912 --> 06:41.445
You're gonna freak out
all the other mayors.

06:41.547 --> 06:46.650
What about, like,
the most, uh--

06:46.752 --> 06:47.985
Why are you eating carrots?

06:48.087 --> 06:50.287
Oh, well, it, uh--
keratin--

06:50.389 --> 06:51.989
and the carrot
works on the nails.

06:52.091 --> 06:53.891
I would prefer not to see you
eat with those nails.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.459
- No.
- How about most sunglasses

06:55.561 --> 06:57.294
- on somebody's face?
- Ah, that's funny.

06:57.396 --> 06:58.929
That could be good,
but could that be sustained?

06:59.031 --> 07:00.364
- What do you mean?
- Well it has to be something

07:00.466 --> 07:01.999
the tourists are gonna
wanna come and see.

07:02.068 --> 07:03.534
Do you think people are gonna
line up around the block

07:03.636 --> 07:05.536
to take pictures with you
as a selfie?

07:05.638 --> 07:07.304
I mean, really,
all I care about

07:07.373 --> 07:08.973
is for people
to look at me and say,

07:09.075 --> 07:10.874
"Who's that mayor?"

07:10.977 --> 07:12.476
Oh, we're fine on tourists.

07:12.578 --> 07:15.446
I just was hoping
to scratch this itch for you.

07:15.548 --> 07:17.281
Mm-hmm. And to be honest,
that's one of

07:17.383 --> 07:18.616
the great things
about these nails.

07:18.718 --> 07:20.351
You can scratch, like,
a little itch.

07:20.453 --> 07:23.721
Or if you need to itch your ear.
You just get in like that.

07:23.823 --> 07:25.122
You don't have to put
your whole finger in,

07:25.224 --> 07:27.458
you just put just the nail,
like that.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.226
You're gonna scratch yourself,
Mr. Mayor.

07:29.295 --> 07:31.195
Oh, there's nothing better
than a nail scratch.

07:31.297 --> 07:32.730
I'm good on itches
right now.

07:32.832 --> 07:34.131
- Yeah, same here.
- You got an itch, let me know.

07:34.233 --> 07:35.299
I'm happy to scratch,
to demonstrate.

07:35.401 --> 07:36.333
- No, thanks.
- No, thank you.

07:36.435 --> 07:37.901
Okay.

07:41.507 --> 07:44.008
- Sir, can you do that, uh--
- All right, I'm good.

07:44.110 --> 07:45.976
- Yeah, we'll see you later.
- Great.

07:46.078 --> 07:48.078
- I would shake your hand, but--
- But--

07:48.180 --> 07:49.213
- Not today.
- Yeah, not--

07:49.315 --> 07:50.870
- Or wave.
- All right.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.450
_

07:52.451 --> 07:54.752
And check this out.
This is our Hall of Mayors.

07:56.589 --> 07:58.122
Who's that Mayor?

08:02.165 --> 08:03.966
You got the string cheese?

08:04.068 --> 08:05.368
- Right.
- Can Stacey come over

08:05.436 --> 08:07.603
for a play date?

08:07.705 --> 08:09.805
- Who's Stacey?
- She's um-- uh,

08:09.907 --> 08:12.975
a girl at-- in my class.
Oh.

08:13.077 --> 08:14.710
Um, Mommy and Daddy
will talk about it.

08:14.812 --> 08:15.945
Okay.

08:16.047 --> 08:17.713
Ooh, bus.

08:17.815 --> 08:19.615
- Here we go. All right.
- All right.

08:19.717 --> 08:20.783
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

08:20.885 --> 08:23.052
Hi, Ron. All right.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.955
Love you, buddy.

08:26.057 --> 08:28.557
- Hmm.
- Okay.

08:28.659 --> 08:32.160
- Restaurants, bars, um--
- Okay, there. Kids.

08:32.563 --> 08:34.462
- Woodbridge Elementary.
- All right.

08:34.565 --> 08:36.965
Stacey D. Look at that picture.
I don't like that.

08:37.068 --> 08:38.967
She looks loud.

08:39.070 --> 08:40.635
She gave her one star.

08:40.738 --> 08:42.203
"This kid will get
your kid sick

08:42.306 --> 08:44.139
and then everyone
in your family will get sick."

08:44.241 --> 08:45.474
Yeah, but you know
who wrote that?

08:45.576 --> 08:47.543
- Janel H.
- Oh, she's crazy.

08:47.645 --> 08:48.977
Yeah, she's, like,
a drama queen.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.312
"Play with this kid
at your own risk.

08:50.414 --> 08:52.047
She's been exposed
to video games."

08:52.149 --> 08:53.048
No. I don't--

08:53.150 --> 08:54.516
- Ah, so what?
- No.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.185
"Say good-bye to your
relaxing weekend."

08:56.287 --> 08:58.020
- Oh, no.
- Okay, enough, enough, enough.

08:58.122 --> 08:59.521
Okay. So that's it
for Stacey D.

08:59.623 --> 09:00.522
- All right?
- Okay. Let's look at this.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.091
Other kids nearby.

09:02.159 --> 09:05.227
Emily D. "Had to wait 45 minutes
just to figure out

09:05.329 --> 09:06.995
what the heck this kid
was babbling about.

09:07.098 --> 09:09.465
Next time, I'll go next door
and talk to Benny.

09:09.567 --> 09:11.333
Much faster conversation."

09:11.435 --> 09:13.035
I'm not having a beer
with these kids.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.570
I know, what--
what do you want?

09:14.672 --> 09:16.371
Look at this one.
"Couldn't find this kid.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.741
Looked around forever.
Went in circles.

09:18.843 --> 09:20.109
Probably doesn't even exist."

09:20.177 --> 09:22.144
"I think this kid
is actually 20.

09:22.246 --> 09:26.348
Was clearly wearing a wig
and held a lollipop."

09:26.450 --> 09:28.183
- I'm glad we're doing this.
- Ooh, who's Lindsey?

09:28.285 --> 09:29.885
Lindsey.
"Still believes in Santa.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.187
Doesn't know about
Internet or TV."

09:32.289 --> 09:35.257
- I mean, that is pretty amazing.
- "She'll ask for Band-Aids,

09:35.359 --> 09:36.859
even though she's not bleeding."

09:36.961 --> 09:38.160
I mean, that's--
every kid does that.

09:38.262 --> 09:39.394
- I did that.
- Okay.

09:39.497 --> 09:40.529
- Seems good to me.
- All right,

09:40.631 --> 09:41.897
let's go with Lindsey.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.332
- She's got four stars.
- Great.

09:43.434 --> 09:44.933
Okay.

09:46.637 --> 09:47.936
Let's go to
the bathroom together.

09:55.446 --> 09:57.179
Grover, how do you like
your play date?

09:57.281 --> 10:00.516
- This is not Stacey.
- I know. It's-- it's Lindsey.

10:00.618 --> 10:02.417
- I don't know her.
- Well, we don't either,

10:02.520 --> 10:04.787
but she had a lot of
positive ratings.

10:04.889 --> 10:07.556
Lindsey, did you know
you're four stars?

10:07.658 --> 10:09.958
I give her zero stars.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.260
That's not really
how it works.

10:11.362 --> 10:13.061
We have to at least
give one star.

10:14.231 --> 10:16.431
Is that for us?

10:16.534 --> 10:18.634
Wow, uh, 20 bucks.

10:18.736 --> 10:20.235
Can that give us ice cream?

10:20.337 --> 10:21.637
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.305
Five stars.

10:33.551 --> 10:35.951
- Okay.
- Uh-oh, you all done?

10:36.053 --> 10:38.453
- Uh, getting there.
- Oh, good.

10:38.556 --> 10:40.455
Yeah, I did wanna
let you guys know

10:40.558 --> 10:43.392
I was down in the basement
and, um,

10:43.494 --> 10:45.961
the ants have sort of
burrowed their way into

10:46.063 --> 10:47.596
your, uh, joists.

10:47.698 --> 10:48.764
I don't know if you're
familiar with construction.

10:48.866 --> 10:50.933
Uh, yeah, I am.

10:51.035 --> 10:53.101
- Okay.
- Lance, what is a joist?

10:53.204 --> 10:55.170
- It's a support beam.
- Then we can't just avoid

10:55.272 --> 10:57.306
- that part of the house.
- No.

10:57.408 --> 10:58.574
No, no, that's a death trap.

10:58.676 --> 11:00.142
We're standing on a death trap.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.512
You know ants are not
traditional burrowers into wood.

11:03.614 --> 11:05.848
Well, they're sugar ants.

11:05.950 --> 11:08.784
Okay? So you're gonna wanna
go ahead and probably

11:08.853 --> 11:10.419
refurbish those joists.

11:10.521 --> 11:12.020
Um, I'm not sure if
that's something

11:12.122 --> 11:13.422
you're comfortable doing, or--

11:13.524 --> 11:14.923
I'm very comfortable
doing that.

11:15.025 --> 11:16.325
I'm working on
another project right now.

11:16.427 --> 11:18.026
So I don't know
if I have the time.

11:18.128 --> 11:19.695
Well, how much is this gonna
cost? I don't understand

11:19.797 --> 11:20.796
- why we all of the sudden--
- I'd have to have

11:20.898 --> 11:22.664
my guy come out and look at it.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.334
- Yeah, sure.
- Hey, Ernie?

11:25.436 --> 11:27.369
Excuse me?
Take off your shoes

11:27.471 --> 11:29.004
if you're gonna go
by the shelves, sir.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.839
Ah, this is all Cincinnati
pine, right here.

11:30.908 --> 11:32.441
That's basically
an ant's best friend.

11:32.543 --> 11:33.675
They're just gonna
go to town on that

11:33.777 --> 11:35.210
like they're eating
a birthday cake.

11:35.312 --> 11:36.511
- Cincinnati pine.
- We're gonna have to

11:36.614 --> 11:39.615
- reroute your plumbing.
- Yeah.

11:39.717 --> 11:41.817
We got a guy.

11:43.554 --> 11:45.988
- Smells good out here.
- Hey, thanks.

11:46.090 --> 11:47.723
So the reroute
of the pipes means

11:47.825 --> 11:49.725
we're gonna start affecting
your electric.

11:49.827 --> 11:52.194
I'd deal with that, but, uh,
I'm gonna finish lunch here.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.363
- Nah, I got a guy for that.
- So does that mean we're gonna

11:54.465 --> 11:55.964
need to deal with some drywall?

11:56.066 --> 11:57.900
Uh, my guy might have a guy.

11:58.002 --> 11:59.701
You got a guy.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.137
Lance, who are all these
people? What's going on?

12:02.239 --> 12:03.639
Yeah, we're dealing
with the ants.

12:03.741 --> 12:05.807
- Who are you cooking for?
- The whole gang.

12:05.910 --> 12:07.376
- You want something?
- No.

12:07.478 --> 12:09.344
Is that a diving board?

12:09.446 --> 12:11.980
Hey, dude.
You're a little early, no?

12:12.082 --> 12:13.315
He's actually
a good pool guy.

12:13.417 --> 12:15.517
He can give you a good estimate.
Fair price.

12:15.619 --> 12:17.085
And you know what?
You got the space for it.

12:17.187 --> 12:18.854
- Here you go, bro.
- All right, bro.

12:18.956 --> 12:20.122
Later.

12:21.992 --> 12:25.193
- Hot dog?
- Good dogs.

12:35.352 --> 12:37.619
We're here to make
your time more efficient.

12:37.721 --> 12:38.920
You called us because why?

12:39.022 --> 12:41.022
I'm late to everything.
I, um--

12:41.125 --> 12:42.324
Let's try to remove
the word "Um"

12:42.426 --> 12:43.692
from your vocabulary.

12:43.794 --> 12:45.360
- Uh--
- And "Uh."

12:45.462 --> 12:46.862
- Okay-- Okay--
- And "Okay."

12:46.964 --> 12:48.263
We tailor your time.

12:48.365 --> 12:50.165
- Great.
- We can take seconds

12:50.267 --> 12:52.367
- out of every second.
- It's about efficiency,

12:52.469 --> 12:55.971
- proficiency, sufficiency.
- The inc-- inciencies.

12:56.073 --> 12:57.873
Let's go through your day.
How long does it take you

12:57.975 --> 13:00.275
- to get up in the morning?
- Half hour.

13:00.377 --> 13:01.476
What time you wake up?

13:01.578 --> 13:03.812
- 6:00.
- Coffee.

13:03.914 --> 13:04.846
- Breakfast.
- Yeah.

13:04.948 --> 13:06.214
- You pee?
- Oh, yeah.

13:06.316 --> 13:08.517
Peeing is work.
Push as hard as you can.

13:08.619 --> 13:10.385
Think of it as, like, a spear.

13:10.487 --> 13:12.354
My face turns red
with how hard I push.

13:12.423 --> 13:13.722
- Really?
- What's your job?

13:13.824 --> 13:15.223
I watch bridges
go up and down.

13:15.325 --> 13:16.324
- How long is your commute?
- That's, like,

13:16.427 --> 13:18.693
at least an hour-- traffic--

13:18.796 --> 13:20.061
- hour and a half?
- Is there any way

13:20.164 --> 13:21.196
- you can avoid traffic?
- I mean,

13:21.298 --> 13:22.731
it's all the way across town.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.366
- There are no bridges closer?
- I don't wanna

13:24.468 --> 13:26.401
talk myself out of the job.
Can you bump the car

13:26.503 --> 13:27.869
in front of you?

13:27.971 --> 13:29.738
- That works.
- How about a buddy system?

13:29.840 --> 13:31.473
You know, you got a buddy
drive you to this buddy,

13:31.575 --> 13:33.175
this buddy drives you
to that buddy,

13:33.277 --> 13:34.743
a couple buddies get together,
everybody helps you out

13:34.845 --> 13:36.044
every morning, buddy's over
there at the bridge,

13:36.146 --> 13:37.979
buddy brings you back
after work.

13:38.081 --> 13:39.047
You know, that's what a buddy
system is, a bunch of buddies.

13:39.149 --> 13:40.482
- Okay.
- Give me an example

13:40.584 --> 13:42.083
- of how you waste time.
- I don't know.

13:42.186 --> 13:45.153
I spend, like,
eight hours on Reddit.

13:45.255 --> 13:47.022
I have the same problem.
What I did is

13:47.124 --> 13:49.090
I got a piece of glass
and I painted

13:49.193 --> 13:51.059
- the website Reddit on it.
- Okay.

13:51.161 --> 13:52.260
And then I can't
click on anything,

13:52.362 --> 13:53.762
'cause it's just a painting.

13:56.099 --> 13:57.365
So a sleep should be fast.

13:57.468 --> 13:58.533
What are the positions you use?

14:00.437 --> 14:02.704
- I go like this.
- Mm-hmm.

14:02.806 --> 14:04.005
And then right back up again.

14:04.107 --> 14:05.173
You didn't even
close your eyes.

14:05.275 --> 14:06.541
That's the extent
of my sleep.

14:08.645 --> 14:10.111
This is supposed to
organize your life.

14:10.214 --> 14:11.546
- Right.
- You would think

14:11.648 --> 14:12.981
that I would say
that this is not the way to go.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.083
I think this is great.

14:16.854 --> 14:19.054
Exercises, one thing you can do
is somersaults.

14:19.156 --> 14:21.623
- One, two, three--
- Four.

14:24.161 --> 14:28.396
Also for eye exercise
for reading the ingredients.

14:29.900 --> 14:30.899
And then throughout
the rest of the day,

14:31.001 --> 14:32.133
I've got everything with me.

14:32.236 --> 14:34.302
- Toilet roll.
- Hair dryer, earphones.

14:34.404 --> 14:36.638
This is for cleaning my butt.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.540
Your toothbrush?

14:38.642 --> 14:40.876
Did I say butt?

14:40.978 --> 14:46.715
Uh, for brushing my teeth.

14:51.221 --> 14:53.922
All right, so once again
this year

14:54.024 --> 14:55.790
it's time for Burning Man.

14:55.893 --> 14:57.092
And so we've gotta get ready,

14:57.194 --> 14:58.293
come up with some good costumes.

14:58.395 --> 15:00.662
A good creative idea
so we can

15:00.764 --> 15:02.664
really make an impact this time.

15:02.766 --> 15:06.067
What if we went as,
like, teenage bagels?

15:06.169 --> 15:07.302
Like, everyone loves a bagel,

15:07.404 --> 15:09.437
but do they love teenage bagels?

15:09.540 --> 15:10.672
Oh, like made by teenagers
who are like,

15:10.774 --> 15:12.274
- "Oh, we're closed."
- Yes.

15:12.376 --> 15:14.476
This has gotta be, like,
enticing and beautiful

15:14.578 --> 15:15.610
- and imaginative.
- Why don't you

15:15.712 --> 15:18.346
cut your rat tail
for burning man?

15:19.917 --> 15:21.783
It's not a rat tail. Okay?

15:21.885 --> 15:23.285
It's a hair waterfall.

15:23.387 --> 15:25.120
If it were a rat tail,
it would be thinner.

15:25.222 --> 15:27.188
Maybe it's not, like,
one rat's tail.

15:27.291 --> 15:28.790
Maybe it's like,
there's a bunch of rats

15:28.892 --> 15:31.293
- that are huddled up.
- That implies that my head

15:31.395 --> 15:32.627
is the butt of the rat.

15:32.729 --> 15:34.529
The butt of many rats.

15:34.631 --> 15:36.598
The more you talk about it,
the more upset I'm gonna get.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.266
And I don't want to fight.

15:38.368 --> 15:40.936
We have to do something
really big.

15:41.038 --> 15:42.370
You guys, something just, like--

15:42.472 --> 15:44.072
Like an art car or something.

15:49.146 --> 15:51.012
Wait, I think I know
what he's thinking.

15:52.749 --> 15:56.217
The beast.
It looks down on us all.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.220
Guys, it looks incredible.
Ahh!

15:59.323 --> 16:01.056
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

16:01.158 --> 16:02.891
You're both coming
at the same time.

16:02.993 --> 16:05.894
No being walks like that.

16:05.996 --> 16:08.830
So listen up--
when I say left, go left.

16:08.932 --> 16:10.332
When I say right, go right.

16:10.434 --> 16:12.734
Left, right, left, right.

16:12.836 --> 16:14.235
- I'm-- so I'm right?
- I'm right.

16:14.338 --> 16:16.304
You have to look at it
from our perspective.

16:16.406 --> 16:17.339
Oh, I see what you're doing.

16:17.441 --> 16:18.907
- Yeah.
- Left-- yes, yes.

16:19.009 --> 16:20.709
So, left right.

16:20.811 --> 16:22.310
This is the gas.

16:22.412 --> 16:24.212
For the brake, it's this.

16:24.314 --> 16:26.147
Don't make up weird signals
that we don't understand.

16:26.249 --> 16:28.016
- We can hear you talking.
- Listen, I can't

16:28.118 --> 16:30.218
hear you speak,
so let's do this:

16:30.320 --> 16:32.187
When you're gonna say something
to me and you understand,

16:32.255 --> 16:33.421
beep once.

16:33.523 --> 16:35.256
Lovely. Now you're gonna
take a step.

16:35.359 --> 16:36.491
This is for--

16:36.593 --> 16:37.692
- Yes, what?
- Just letting you know

16:37.794 --> 16:38.693
that I heard you.

16:38.795 --> 16:40.362
But no need to do it anymore.

16:40.464 --> 16:42.163
If you're gonna go
and you've heard me, beep twice.

16:42.265 --> 16:43.565
Great.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.500
No, you just do once.

16:45.602 --> 16:47.902
The monster has awoken.

16:48.005 --> 16:50.405
Forward, forward, forward,
forward, forward.

16:52.943 --> 16:55.844
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

16:55.946 --> 16:58.613
That was too fast. Step.

16:58.715 --> 16:59.781
Stop.

16:59.883 --> 17:01.049
Step.

17:01.151 --> 17:02.117
Stop.

17:02.219 --> 17:03.718
Step.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.854
Stop. I'm here to attack.

17:05.955 --> 17:07.255
Beware...

17:07.357 --> 17:09.057
of the size...

17:09.159 --> 17:10.525
of my feet.

17:10.627 --> 17:13.795
That was great, guys.
I will stomp on you.

17:13.896 --> 17:15.363
Burning Man, all right!

17:15.464 --> 17:17.699
Doing great, guys.
Little bit of traffic ahead.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.534
Hold up, there's a bridge.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.368
I think we need to stop
at, like, 7-Eleven

17:21.471 --> 17:23.637
- if we're going on a road trip.
- I wanna get lunch, too.

17:23.740 --> 17:26.540
Don't go back! Don't go back!
There's no reason to go back.

17:26.643 --> 17:27.976
Dakota, stop, stop, stop.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.475
Good peanut butter. Mmm.

17:39.577 --> 17:42.111
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey.

17:42.213 --> 17:44.079
I'm just, uh, checking out
your PB, here.

17:44.181 --> 17:46.281
You guys were out of J,
so we got a guy on the way

17:46.384 --> 17:47.516
coming with some J.

17:52.456 --> 17:54.022
- Oops.
- Get out!

17:54.125 --> 17:55.491
- Oh, sorry, real quick.
- Get--

17:55.593 --> 17:56.492
Hey, Ernie, I wanna
show you something.

17:56.594 --> 17:57.860
You see this tub, here?

17:57.962 --> 17:59.428
I wanna lift up the tub,
I wanna see--

17:59.530 --> 18:03.298
- Get out, get out, get out!
- All right.

18:03.401 --> 18:06.101
I would advise you to, uh,
do some weatherproofing here.

18:06.203 --> 18:07.970
- Right there, in the cradles.
- Absolutely.

18:08.038 --> 18:09.371
I think you made some good,
smart decisions here.

18:09.473 --> 18:11.006
- I'm proud of you.
- Yeah, I hang out more

18:11.108 --> 18:13.876
with, like, biker guys,
but I like an ant guy.

18:13.978 --> 18:15.711
- Hey.
- Lance.

18:15.813 --> 18:19.148
Lance, hi. Can I have a moment
alone with my husband?

18:19.250 --> 18:20.983
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

18:21.085 --> 18:22.618
Okay, well, why don't we
get lunch. We'll get lunch.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.653
Not you and me, just--
Hey, guys, let's, uh,

18:24.755 --> 18:26.522
let's get some lunch.

18:26.590 --> 18:28.690
Lance, what is this?
There are people everywhere.

18:28.793 --> 18:30.292
I-- there are
a lot of guys around

18:30.394 --> 18:32.461
and-- and I didn't mean it
to get like that.

18:32.563 --> 18:34.530
I do think we're making some
really nice improvements

18:34.598 --> 18:36.498
in the house.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.368
Lance, do you know how much
a skylight really costs to do?

18:39.470 --> 18:42.971
They're charging us $800.
It's about $40 to do this.

18:43.073 --> 18:44.807
I-- I just feel bad, you know?

18:44.909 --> 18:46.308
'Cause it's like...

18:46.410 --> 18:48.510
One guy said one thing
and I agreed with it.

18:48.612 --> 18:51.313
And now he brings someone else.
It's another nice dude,

18:51.415 --> 18:53.148
- you know, and it's like--
- Well they're not your buddies.

18:53.250 --> 18:56.084
I just-- I don't know if I can
be the one to kick them out.

18:56.187 --> 18:58.220
You know what?

18:58.322 --> 19:00.489
I think I know a guy.

19:00.591 --> 19:03.258
- We gotta get a gutter guy.
- Hey, guys, I need a guy!

19:03.360 --> 19:04.927
- This guy's the guy.
- I'm your guy!

19:05.029 --> 19:08.096
Everybody listen up.
I'd like to introduce you

19:08.199 --> 19:11.200
to somebody who knows
a lot about construction.

19:11.302 --> 19:14.203
This is my dad.

19:14.305 --> 19:17.039
- Who's in charge here?
- I'm your guy.

19:17.141 --> 19:18.507
- So, uh--
- He's an exterminator.

19:18.609 --> 19:20.576
What kinda ants are
we talking about, buddy?

19:20.678 --> 19:23.445
- Carpenter ants?
- No, sugar ants, pal.

19:23.547 --> 19:26.081
And, uh, what are these,
uh, sugar ants doing?

19:26.183 --> 19:29.384
They're eating
the joists away, tough guy.

19:29.487 --> 19:32.788
Sugar ants don't eat wood.

19:32.890 --> 19:34.223
Hey, I said that, man.

19:34.325 --> 19:35.791
Good for you, Lance.

19:35.893 --> 19:38.861
- Who's the joist guy?
- Uh, I'm the joist guy.

19:38.963 --> 19:40.729
I like your little
mini Sawzall there.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.565
What is that, 18 volt?

19:43.667 --> 19:45.234
39 or 40.

19:45.336 --> 19:49.505
So why can't you just, uh,
sister the joist?

19:49.573 --> 19:53.041
Well, the wall-- they may not
have compromised the wall,

19:53.143 --> 19:55.377
but if it's a retaining wall--

19:55.479 --> 19:56.478
All right, all right,
all right.

19:56.580 --> 19:58.413
Uh, guys!
We got a dad here.

19:58.516 --> 19:59.781
Let's scram, come on!

20:06.190 --> 20:07.789
Sorry they put you
through that, sweetheart.

20:07.892 --> 20:09.758
- Aw. thanks, Dad.
- I'm really glad you called.

20:09.860 --> 20:10.959
Hey, Lance.

20:11.061 --> 20:12.160
Thanks, man.

20:12.263 --> 20:13.629
- You call me any time.
- Will do.

20:13.731 --> 20:14.830
All right. I'll see you
later, sweetie.

20:14.932 --> 20:16.265
- I'll do it.
- Call your mom.

20:16.367 --> 20:18.300
- All right.
- Ah, Nina, I, uh--

20:18.402 --> 20:19.668
I got a little
something for you.

20:19.770 --> 20:21.603
- What do you mean?
- Let me show you.

20:24.408 --> 20:26.942
Lance! This is what
you were working on.

20:27.044 --> 20:29.511
You know, a little, uh,
ant farm for your friends.

20:29.613 --> 20:33.849
Route 66, flowering cacti,
a motorcycle, little hotel,

20:33.951 --> 20:37.419
- a turtle.
- I love it.

20:37.521 --> 20:39.788
You know, I'm feeling
a little antsy over here.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.990
- Oh, yeah?
- Got a little ant hill growing.

20:42.092 --> 20:43.825
I'm a little--
I'm a little anteater.

20:43.928 --> 20:45.494
- You are?
- Yeah, I'm gonna get in there

20:45.596 --> 20:46.862
and suck all the ants out.

20:46.964 --> 20:49.865
Yeah, let's go inside.

21:01.879 --> 21:03.378
We have pretty good neighbors.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.013
He's crazy and then
there's, like,

21:05.115 --> 21:07.616
- an older-- older lady.
- Okay.

21:07.718 --> 21:09.851
She's really old.
Like, she's actually

21:09.954 --> 21:11.553
like, cooler than
most people I know.

21:11.655 --> 21:14.870
She did, like, burlesque,
like, in the '30s.

21:15.713 --> 21:18.971
And it's like really cool and
what she's wearing is like--

21:18.995 --> 21:22.289
would that be considered
like actual cool clothes today.

21:22.290 --> 21:23.655
Yeah, I'd love to
meet her sometime.
