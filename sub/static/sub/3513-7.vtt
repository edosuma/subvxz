WEBVTT

00:14.314 --> 00:15.315
It's up this way.

00:15.382 --> 00:16.452
How much further?

00:16.516 --> 00:19.156
2.34 miles to the lake.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.460
That means we've gone 9.7.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.635
When do you want to stop for food?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.867
I don't want to stop until
we're naked in that lake.

00:31.164 --> 00:34.771
You'd better have a fire going for
me before I step foot in that lake.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.438
Oh, I'll have a fire
going all righty.

00:41.107 --> 00:42.484
Get down on the ground.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.446
Get down on the ground!

00:45.211 --> 00:48.249
No, no! Dustin! Oh, my God!

00:48.314 --> 00:50.521
Please, please,
please! Please don't shoot!

00:51.051 --> 00:53.930
We were just hiking
to Shannon Lake.

00:53.987 --> 00:54.988
Never heard of it.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.092
People know that
we're out here, man.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.728
That's too bad for them if
they come looking for you.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.773
What are you going to do?

01:01.995 --> 01:04.474
Once I figure out if you're
cops or not, then I'll decide.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.135
We're not cops!
We own a doggie wash!

01:07.100 --> 01:10.013
Will you let us go?

01:10.703 --> 01:12.649
I got $3 million growing up here.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.350
No, no, no! Please don't!
Please don't!

01:15.408 --> 01:16.853
Nothing personal. Please don't!

01:16.910 --> 01:18.651
Please don't! Please don't!

01:19.979 --> 01:21.754
Please help me!

01:22.916 --> 01:24.827
Please, please, please.

02:01.688 --> 02:02.962
Dustin...

02:03.723 --> 02:04.758
Okay. Get the rope.

02:04.824 --> 02:06.326
Okay, okay.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.138
Go! Go!

03:01.080 --> 03:02.889
Ooh! That is one broken neck.

03:05.118 --> 03:08.258
From those abrasions, they
probably used a pretty hefty rope.

03:08.321 --> 03:10.460
Well, what do you know?
It's Delmar Blake.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.900
We've been looking for
him for three years.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.394
What'd he do?

03:15.161 --> 03:16.231
Just about everything.

03:17.497 --> 03:20.034
We knew he was moving drugs,
we just didn't realize he was growing them.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.312
Hair.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.315
Obviously not his.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.814
Think he's got a
girlfriend around here?

03:35.281 --> 03:36.316
Maybe.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.092
Got anything for us?

03:43.156 --> 03:45.534
Well, it's kind of weird.
There's not a bit of food left,

03:45.592 --> 03:47.071
no sleeping bag, no blankets.

03:47.126 --> 03:49.265
You got millions of dollars worth
of marijuana plants out there

03:49.329 --> 03:50.467
and not one of them was taken.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.441
You're saying somebody
killed him for his supplies?

03:52.665 --> 03:53.735
That's what it looks like.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.279
Somebody got their
priorities screwed up.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.878
Maybe we're talking Bigfoot?

03:57.403 --> 04:00.282
I don't think Bigfoot would
fit into the sleeping bag.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.512
I'm going to go talk
to the DEA guys.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.609
All right.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.211
Yeah, it used to be nice
and pristine up here,

04:04.277 --> 04:05.779
before the damned
drug dealers moved in.

04:06.446 --> 04:09.586
We've had a lot of campsites raided.
Food, clothing, you name it.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.854
So, you ever see anything
like this before?

04:13.553 --> 04:15.863
Someone kills the grower,
but leaves all of the plants?

04:16.154 --> 04:19.601
No. Look, all I know is someone made
our life a little easier, all right?

04:19.659 --> 04:20.762
One less scumbag in the world.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.431
Now, we're going to move the
body if you're done with it.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.475
I'm going to take another look.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.680
I got this.

06:16.008 --> 06:19.649
He was going to kill us, and then he
heard something and he just walked off.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.918
And we heard a gunshot,

06:20.980 --> 06:23.790
and then it sounded like
somebody was being choked.

06:23.950 --> 06:24.985
You see anybody else?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.052
No.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.757
You hear anything else? Yes.

06:27.820 --> 06:31.666
Something came into the camp and
started knocking stuff over.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.201
We don't know what it was.
We just saw shadows.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.102
And heard something, like a growl.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.805
It took us forever to get free,
and then we just ran.

06:37.864 --> 06:38.865
You never saw his body?

06:38.931 --> 06:40.001
No.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.240
But whatever it was,
it saved our lives.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.513
The FBI confirmed the
identity of Delmar Blake.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.853
Lab confirmed the hair we found on his
neck and on the tree were not Blake's.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.150
Is it one of the hikers?

06:55.214 --> 06:56.625
We don't know. We're testing DNA.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.559
We've got samples of
hair off both the hikers.

06:58.618 --> 06:59.824
You're sure they had
nothing to do with it?

07:00.019 --> 07:01.760
We ran a background check,
no priors.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.328
They run a doggie
wash in Beaverton.

07:03.389 --> 07:04.459
Hmm.

07:04.524 --> 07:07.061
Nothing to indicate that they'd have
anything to do with Blake or drugs.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.306
So, what is it, another drug dealer
getting rid of the competition?

07:10.363 --> 07:11.706
They would have taken his plants.

07:12.498 --> 07:16.207
Yeah, who kills a pot grower in the middle
of the woods for a sleeping bag and some
food?

07:16.736 --> 07:18.738
Somebody hungry and cold.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.642
You just wait right there. Hey.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.685
So, I got a couple of
knuckle draggers here,

07:25.912 --> 07:28.153
demanding to see
their brother's body.

07:30.349 --> 07:33.159
That upstanding citizen Delmar
Blake apparently has family.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.006
Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin.
How can we help you guys?

07:42.061 --> 07:43.233
Are you the ones who
found our brother?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.606
We're the ones investigating
the death of Delmar Blake.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.576
You two have IDs?
Why? What'd we do?

07:47.834 --> 07:49.711
Before we divulge any information,

07:49.769 --> 07:51.271
we have to know who
we're talking to.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.977
How'd he die? Gun?
Knife? Beaten to death?

07:56.042 --> 07:57.453
We're still trying
to determine that.

07:57.510 --> 07:58.989
What? You can't tell
by looking at him?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.385
We want to see the body.

08:00.446 --> 08:01.447
Well, it's at the morgue.

08:01.514 --> 08:02.686
Doesn't change what I said.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.084
Then you'll have to meet us there.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.123
Well, let's get it done.

08:12.725 --> 08:15.467
There's a chick magnet
if I ever saw one.

08:18.297 --> 08:19.640
Why'd you cut him open?

08:19.699 --> 08:21.542
To determine the cause of death.

08:21.601 --> 08:22.773
It's a homicide investigation.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.815
He was strangled.
Even I can see that.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.043
Did you know your
brother was involved

08:26.105 --> 08:28.312
with illegal cultivation
of a controlled substance?

08:28.374 --> 08:29.375
I don't care what he was doing.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.477
I want to know who killed him.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.386
And maybe do something about it?

08:33.613 --> 08:34.852
A lot more than you're going to do.

08:35.881 --> 08:38.726
You should let us do our jobs
before you become our jobs.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.332
Don't you feel that
cold air in here?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.605
It's bad for the body
when it gets too hot.

08:47.994 --> 08:51.134
He's just talking.
Now we're leaving.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.641
What do you see in those two?

08:58.871 --> 08:59.906
Priors.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.246
Let's see if you pinned
the tail on those donkeys.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.424
Assault, disturbing the peace,

09:07.480 --> 09:10.984
tax fraud and dealing in stolen goods,
but no drug charges.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.291
So maybe they weren't
involved with their brother.

09:13.352 --> 09:14.695
Any outstanding warrants?

09:14.754 --> 09:16.199
Disappointingly, no.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.632
I guess they just haven't
been caught lately.

09:17.690 --> 09:18.760
Hmm.

09:18.925 --> 09:21.337
Hold onto your...
Whatever you hold on to.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.873
You're not going to believe this.

09:22.929 --> 09:25.569
We just got the lab report back on the
brunette hair you found at the scene.

09:25.631 --> 09:26.632
Mmm-hmm?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.914
Holly Clark? You sure?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.547
We got a preliminary match.

09:34.607 --> 09:35.847
They're running the tests
again to make sure.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.484
One of the more depressing
cases I ever worked.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.248
A little girl playing in her
mother's backyard just vanished.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.056
A massive search,
turned up nothing.

09:44.150 --> 09:47.222
Seven years old. She's been
missing for nine years.

09:47.486 --> 09:50.365
She was adopted and her birth
mother was a drug addict.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.697
No one was ever charged.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.532
She'd be 15, 16 years old.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.199
This girl's out in the woods living
with a drug dealer all these years?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.468
We better lock down her identity

09:57.530 --> 09:59.635
before we start
banging drums on this.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.042
How much you got on this case?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.205
Boxes and boxes of files.
You want them brought up?

10:03.269 --> 10:04.612
Yes, I want to see everything.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.147
Better make some room.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.751
Looks like it's going to
be a dine-at-desk night.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.759
I'll see if I can find out if Blake is any
way connected to the girl or her family,

10:16.816 --> 10:19.660
and where he was the
night she was abducted.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.531
Uh, Nick. Um, is this important?

10:59.592 --> 11:00.662
Because I'm right
in the middle of...

11:00.726 --> 11:01.727
Yeah, it is.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.239
No, no, no, but you see,
the thing is I...

11:06.265 --> 11:09.178
Whoa. I mean,
you really like Christmas.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.442
Look, it's a long
tradition in my family,

11:11.504 --> 11:15.316
and, well, while you're here,
you might as well help.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.179
Here, hang on to that.
And don't mess with that.

11:19.245 --> 11:22.158
That is an antique. 1935, pre-war.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.626
Wait till you see these babies run.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.259
Look, I need to show you something.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.197
Yeah, yeah. Just a sec.

11:31.490 --> 11:35.028
Here, hand me the caboose,
and step back from the tracks.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.143
What do you think?

11:50.476 --> 11:52.922
I think you have too much
time on your hands, Monroe.

11:53.979 --> 11:55.925
Juliette and I don't
even have a light up yet.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.252
You should see me in my Santa suit.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.586
Yeah, a Blutbad as Santa.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.223
Hey, I'm pretty good,
but it's true.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.064
I'm no Gefrehren gebber.

12:08.761 --> 12:10.263
Wait a minute.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.599
You're telling me
that Santa Claus is...

12:12.965 --> 12:14.774
Well, think about it.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.737
I mean, who else
could live up there?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.243
Huh.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.446
You want an eggnog?
I make it from scratch.

12:21.507 --> 12:22.713
No, no.

12:24.477 --> 12:28.118
I want you to tell me if
she could be a Blutbad.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.384
I can't tell what
she is from a photo.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.556
Well, if she is something like you,

12:35.421 --> 12:38.800
could she survive by herself
in the woods for nine years?

12:38.858 --> 12:41.361
Well, if she wasn't,
definitely not.

12:41.627 --> 12:42.901
What is she, lost or something?

12:43.162 --> 12:47.872
Well, there's a possibility she was
abducted nine years ago at the age of seven.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.003
Wow.

12:50.202 --> 12:52.739
And you think she's been living
in the woods for nine years?

12:53.506 --> 12:54.985
Yeah, we have evidence it was her.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.580
Well, I mean, if she was
only seven years old,

12:57.643 --> 12:59.816
you know, society hasn't had
that much influence on her,

12:59.879 --> 13:01.756
so she'd still be a wild child.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.856
Her instincts would
be working full time,

13:03.916 --> 13:06.362
so, you know,
she'd have a decent chance.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.326
Not sure I'd want to run
into her now, though.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.129
All right, she was adopted
at a very young age.

13:11.190 --> 13:14.194
I don't know if her adoptive
parents were Blutbaden.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.103
Could that be a problem? Yeah.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.937
I mean, she'd have no one who
understood what she was going through.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.642
Did you know you were
Blutbad when you were born?

13:27.973 --> 13:29.884
Let me put it this way.

13:30.843 --> 13:34.256
The first time you feel the surge,
and you fang out,

13:34.480 --> 13:35.959
it is pretty weird.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.859
I bit through my lip
I ripped my pants.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.989
It scared the crap out of me.

13:41.754 --> 13:45.133
So, are you telling me there's a possibility
that she does not know who she is?

13:45.191 --> 13:46.829
I mean, if she didn't have
parents that understood?

13:47.293 --> 13:48.431
Definitely.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.940
Yeah. I mean, that could be why
she never came out of the woods.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.240
I'm going back out there,
and I want you to come with me.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.580
How did I know you
were going to say that?

13:58.637 --> 14:00.241
Monroe, if she is
something like you,

14:00.306 --> 14:02.547
I cannot risk someone else's
life taking them out there.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.949
Apparently you're
willing to risk mine.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.149
You're like her.
You could understand her...

14:07.213 --> 14:09.352
Look, even if she accepts me,

14:09.415 --> 14:12.294
I haven't been living in
the woods for nine years.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.989
I'd be no match for
something like that.

14:19.258 --> 14:20.362
I think she might be wounded.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.967
That doesn't make it better.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.439
Well, I'm going back out there.

14:26.498 --> 14:27.499
Not at night.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.068
Tomorrow morning?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.015
We'd better be prepared.

14:34.073 --> 14:35.746
You're full of it.

14:36.508 --> 14:37.919
I'm telling you. No way.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.756
I saw it with my own two eyes.

14:39.812 --> 14:40.847
Here in Portland?

14:40.913 --> 14:41.948
They don't really exist.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.084
I was in his house.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.183
You were in a Grimm's house?

14:44.250 --> 14:45.285
Yes.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.921
If that's true,
how come he didn't kill you?

14:46.986 --> 14:48.556
'Cause I got the hell out
of there, that's why.

14:48.621 --> 14:53.661
Okay, so where does he live, Mr.
"I Saw A Grimm And Lived To Tell About It"?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.933
Fifty bucks says you're
full of tree sap.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.690
Hey, buddy. Got the time?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.786
9:06.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.489
Oh, man! Oh, man!
That's him! That's him!

15:47.546 --> 15:49.787
Get down! Get down! Oh! Get lower!

15:53.585 --> 15:54.757
Go!

16:05.197 --> 16:08.110
Can you imagine losing
your child like that?

16:08.300 --> 16:09.711
No, I can't.

16:10.235 --> 16:14.911
Kind of hard to believe a little girl
could survive out there all these years.

16:15.607 --> 16:16.881
Guess so.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.922
I studied feral child syndrome
in one of my psychology classes.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.186
Most are cases of child abuse.

16:22.681 --> 16:25.287
The whole "raised by wolves"
thing was never really proven.

16:25.351 --> 16:29.197
Well, that's why we're being
extra cautious about this.

16:29.888 --> 16:32.129
Have you told the parents yet?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.066
Not yet.

16:37.062 --> 16:40.271
This is one of those times
I do not envy your job.

16:42.801 --> 16:43.871
Mmm.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.177
You realize you're going to
be opening up old wounds.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.618
I know. I lived through it.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.815
That's why we have to be 110% sure.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.422
And we need to keep a low profile.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.518
I can't sit on this forever,
you know?

16:57.583 --> 16:59.119
I give you 24 hours to find
out something definitive.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.354
How do you want to do this?

17:01.420 --> 17:02.455
We're going to split up.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.797
I'm going to see if I can track
down the adoptive parents

17:04.857 --> 17:06.928
and see if anybody,
maybe a family member,

17:06.992 --> 17:08.528
could have taken Holly
into those woods.

17:08.727 --> 17:09.728
And you?

17:10.262 --> 17:11.832
I'm going back out
to the crime scene,

17:11.896 --> 17:13.740
see if I can find any
other evidence of Holly.

17:13.932 --> 17:14.967
You taking anyone with you?

17:15.067 --> 17:16.808
Not if we want to
keep this low profile.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.176
What about other drug
dealers in the area?

17:18.804 --> 17:21.808
Well, if there were, DEA sent them all
running when they mopped up the area.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.854
They found the guy they were looking for.
The rest is up to us.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.112
Okay, you take whatever you need.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.125
Any hard evidence comes
back to me first.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.455
Yes, sir.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.107
This is where I found his body.

17:54.173 --> 17:55.584
Weird vibes out here.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.183
Now, his gun was pointing this way,

17:59.078 --> 18:01.456
but I found some
buckshot right here.

18:02.281 --> 18:03.555
And some strands of hair.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.525
Where'd you see her?

18:07.453 --> 18:11.333
Well, I saw something over
this way and I followed it.

18:13.325 --> 18:14.804
It was in here that I saw it.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.533
Would you stop saying "it."

18:16.595 --> 18:19.542
All I know is that it was a
Blutbad and it had long hair.

18:23.535 --> 18:24.536
You got something?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.708
Just give me a second, okay?

18:32.578 --> 18:34.285
What is it? Burdock root!

18:35.013 --> 18:37.960
I haven't seen this stuff
since I was a kid in Scouts.

18:38.016 --> 18:39.393
Oh, my God.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.292
Yeah, it's a... It's a painkiller.
It's like aspirin.

18:42.354 --> 18:45.267
You chew on the root It's
also a fine diuretic...

18:46.158 --> 18:48.695
But I digress. Yeah.

18:50.095 --> 18:53.076
We should gear up.
This is going to take awhile.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.283
What are you actually smelling?

19:04.343 --> 19:05.879
Hell if I know.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.753
I just get the scent, you know?

19:09.214 --> 19:13.128
It's not a moose, it's not a bear,
it's not a deer.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.588
We have our own unique bouquet.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.724
Huh.

19:17.556 --> 19:18.933
Here we go.

19:20.459 --> 19:21.597
A knochen hof.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.139
Let me guess.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.297
Bone yard?

19:24.363 --> 19:26.104
Literally speaking, yes.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.271
But there's a spiritual meaning.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.248
We've taken a life to sustain life,

19:33.605 --> 19:37.883
and the sacrifice has to be honored,
you know, before digestion begins.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.619
Ooh. Whoa.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.594
We're in the right place.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.528
You don't smell that?
She marked territory here.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.200
You mean we're on her property?

20:02.367 --> 20:03.539
There!

20:43.609 --> 20:44.952
Holy crap.

20:45.611 --> 20:46.988
That was...

20:47.579 --> 20:48.922
Holy crap!

20:52.951 --> 20:54.123
Don't lose her!

21:14.940 --> 21:16.476
Where'd she go?

21:20.178 --> 21:22.021
We lost her. We haven't lost her.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.450
She thinks she's lost us.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.755
Ah, I can still smell her.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.630
I just don't know where
it's coming from.

21:38.530 --> 21:39.907
I think I know where she is.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.009
That's a hell of a hunting blind.

21:54.813 --> 21:55.883
I think I should probably go first.

21:55.947 --> 21:57.187
Yeah, you got this one.

22:29.981 --> 22:31.016
Yes?

22:31.083 --> 22:33.859
I'm Hank Griffin, Portland PD.
Are you Mrs. Clark?

22:34.419 --> 22:35.523
Yes.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.601
Did you find her body? No, ma'am.

22:39.925 --> 22:40.960
I don't want to alarm you,

22:41.026 --> 22:43.905
but we're looking into some new
aspects of Holly's disappearance.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.766
Why would you do that?

22:47.399 --> 22:50.403
We're trying to establish any
connection we can with Tillamook Forest.

22:51.236 --> 22:54.809
Did you or, uh, any of your family
ever spend anytime up there?

22:55.674 --> 22:58.621
Yeah. We camped out there a couple of times,
but that's about it.

22:58.977 --> 23:01.150
My husband wasn't really
the outdoors type.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.989
We just did it because
Holly seemed to enjoy it.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.290
We... We had to borrow
equipment from a neighbor.

23:06.451 --> 23:07.987
I don't even remember where
we camped out, actually.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.464
Why, did you find
something up there?

23:09.521 --> 23:11.694
We're just trying to
expand the territory

23:11.757 --> 23:15.068
to see if we can link her
disappearance to a suspect.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.734
You have a suspect? No, ma'am.

23:18.864 --> 23:21.743
As soon as I have something
concrete to tell you, I will.

23:24.035 --> 23:26.140
But I don't want to
get your hopes up.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.079
You think your husband can
remember where you camped?

23:30.609 --> 23:32.486
I'm sorry, but he passed
away five years ago.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.559
Thank you very much for your time.

23:37.883 --> 23:40.363
If you can think of anything else
that might help us, please call me.

23:43.955 --> 23:49.098
You said you borrowed some camping
equipment from a neighbor.

23:51.296 --> 23:52.366
Would they know where you camped?

23:53.832 --> 23:54.970
I mean, he might...

23:55.033 --> 23:57.013
Mr. Addison knew a lot
about that kind of stuff,

23:57.068 --> 23:59.070
but he moved away a long time ago.

23:59.704 --> 24:00.808
Do you remember his first name?

24:00.906 --> 24:01.907
Yeah. Jimmy.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.142
Do you know where he moved?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.687
No, I'm afraid I don't.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.893
You know, I was one of the
officers assigned to help find her.

24:13.218 --> 24:14.356
I've never forgotten.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.300
Thank you.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.870
It's Hank. You know those
files I had you pull?

24:27.732 --> 24:29.803
I'm looking for a Jimmy
or James Addison.

24:29.868 --> 24:31.279
He was a neighbor to the Clarks.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.909
I want to see if you can find
him so I can talk to him.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.351
Yeah. Thanks.

24:48.887 --> 24:49.957
She's here.

24:50.922 --> 24:52.526
She's passed out.

24:53.725 --> 24:54.760
I'm going in.

25:31.563 --> 25:34.840
If she goes for my throat,
shoot her.

25:46.411 --> 25:48.015
She's going to need some first aid.

25:59.424 --> 26:02.234
It's okay. It's okay.

26:03.094 --> 26:06.632
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

26:10.969 --> 26:13.506
She's got a really high fever.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.250
Wow, you're starting to
look like a detective.

26:17.309 --> 26:18.379
Starting to feel like one.

26:19.544 --> 26:24.254
I found your Jimmy Addison,
but I also found this.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.693
All the neighbors were interviewed
the day Holly Clark disappeared.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.455
He had the best alibi.

26:29.521 --> 26:30.556
Where was he?

26:30.622 --> 26:31.623
In the hospital.

26:32.357 --> 26:35.167
Apparently he was bit by a wild
dog while hiking in the woods.

26:35.226 --> 26:36.603
Had a pretty big bite
taken out of him.

26:37.028 --> 26:39.167
Shattered his tibia and
took out a hunk of muscle.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.005
They ever find the dog? Nope.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.101
Anybody with him?

26:42.167 --> 26:43.771
Not according to his statement.

26:44.836 --> 26:45.871
Did he say where he was hiking?

26:45.937 --> 26:47.814
Yup, up near Mount Hood.

26:48.573 --> 26:50.678
This doesn't make any sense.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.283
He was treated at Community
Hospital in Beaverton.

26:54.779 --> 26:55.951
If you're hiking near Mount Hood,

26:56.014 --> 26:57.516
there are closer
hospitals than Beaverton.

26:57.582 --> 27:00.062
He would have had to drive 100
miles to get to that hospital.

27:01.219 --> 27:02.721
Would you drive that far
with your leg like that?

27:02.787 --> 27:04.858
What, are you kidding?
I'd be screaming my head off.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.527
I have a very low
tolerance for pain.

27:08.493 --> 27:11.030
So he was never
considered a suspect.

27:11.429 --> 27:12.430
How did we miss this?

27:12.697 --> 27:14.506
Well, if he was in the hospital
the day of her disappearance,

27:14.566 --> 27:15.943
that's a pretty damned good alibi.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.205
You got a last known address?

27:18.570 --> 27:19.844
Ready when you are.

27:27.512 --> 27:29.924
She definitely took some buckshot.

27:33.418 --> 27:35.625
Don't make any sudden moves.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.561
Holly?

27:45.730 --> 27:46.902
Holly Clark?

27:48.800 --> 27:49.835
We're here to help you.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.006
Do you understand me?

27:55.740 --> 27:57.344
I am a police officer.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.520
Okay, this is going well.

28:00.578 --> 28:02.785
I think we're experiencing a
bit of a language barrier.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.258
Well, she trusts you. Yeah, well.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.152
Let me try a more
direct approach here.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.774
You are Holly Clark.

28:24.602 --> 28:25.706
You're hurt.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.076
He's putting medicine
in your wounds.

28:42.420 --> 28:43.831
Holly Clark.

28:59.337 --> 29:00.509
Holly.

29:21.025 --> 29:25.167
I told you everything I told the police.
I didn't kill your brother.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.104
There was someone else out there.

29:27.165 --> 29:29.611
That's just what I would have told
the cops if I'd killed somebody.

29:31.002 --> 29:32.174
For God's sakes,
do you really think

29:32.237 --> 29:34.843
that I could have
killed your brother?

29:36.274 --> 29:37.617
Well, what do we do with him now?

29:37.675 --> 29:39.586
Keep him here till we
find out if he's lying,

29:39.644 --> 29:41.646
we go back out there and
find whoever did it.

29:41.713 --> 29:42.987
I think we should kill him now.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.287
Can't kill him till we
find out if he's lying.

29:45.350 --> 29:48.490
If he is, he'll wish we
would have killed him,

29:48.553 --> 29:51.056
instead of what we're going
to do to him when we get back.

29:51.422 --> 29:53.902
You have a little time
to mull that over now.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.977
Well, there's no green thumb here.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.385
Just a sec.

30:14.879 --> 30:15.983
Who is it?

30:16.047 --> 30:18.152
Detective Griffin and Officer Wu.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.726
What do you want?
Are you James Addison?

30:23.421 --> 30:25.128
Yes. What's this about?

30:25.223 --> 30:26.497
Mind if we come in?

30:26.958 --> 30:28.835
Uh, I was, uh...

30:28.893 --> 30:29.963
This will only take a minute.

30:30.528 --> 30:32.940
Okay. Come on in.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.067
Can I ask what this is about?

30:35.133 --> 30:37.170
We've re-opened the
Holly Clark case.

30:37.235 --> 30:40.705
I believe you were a neighbor
of hers when she disappeared?

30:40.772 --> 30:44.219
That was so terrible.
She was such a sweet little girl.

30:44.809 --> 30:47.119
You lent the Clark family
some camping equipment.

30:47.779 --> 30:48.849
Yes.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.385
Do you remember where
they went camping?

30:51.449 --> 30:54.692
Uh, not really. I guess I
suggested a few places.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.758
I don't really remember.
That was a long time ago.

30:57.822 --> 30:59.495
You were injured the
same day she was taken.

31:00.058 --> 31:01.696
That's right.
I was in the hospital.

31:01.759 --> 31:03.864
They talked to me there.
That should have been in your reports.

31:04.028 --> 31:06.440
Yeah, we're trying to establish
if there was any unusual activity

31:06.497 --> 31:07.999
in the neighborhood that day.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.875
We're going back through
all our old interviews

31:09.934 --> 31:12.414
to see if anybody
remembers seeing anything.

31:12.503 --> 31:15.712
Well, I was gone all day,
hiking up in Mount Hood,

31:16.174 --> 31:18.120
back when I used to be able to.

31:18.176 --> 31:21.282
Yeah, I like that area.
I go hiking there a lot.

31:21.346 --> 31:22.347
Whereabouts were you?

31:22.780 --> 31:25.090
I was on my way back
from Shining Lake.

31:25.850 --> 31:26.885
You were by yourself, right?

31:27.685 --> 31:30.859
Yeah, I always hiked alone.
I liked the solitude.

31:31.289 --> 31:32.427
But just not on that day.

31:33.558 --> 31:34.559
What do you mean?

31:34.826 --> 31:38.797
Well, you were bitten by a wild dog.
That's what the report said.

31:39.597 --> 31:42.373
Yeah. If you know all this,
why these questions?

31:42.433 --> 31:43.434
Just one more.

31:44.669 --> 31:48.048
Why did you drive all the way from
Mount Hood to Beaverton to get treated?

31:48.106 --> 31:50.450
That's 100 miles away.
You could have been treated much closer.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.578
My doctor works out of Beaverton.

31:52.744 --> 31:53.779
Your doctor's name is?

31:54.779 --> 31:56.986
Look, I'm on disability
because of that day,

31:57.048 --> 31:58.721
and I really don't
appreciate your tone.

31:58.783 --> 32:01.059
They've never found any
wild dogs up there.

32:01.119 --> 32:02.530
Well, maybe it was a coyote.
I don't know.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.830
I was being attacked. I didn't
stop to consult my animal guide.

32:06.658 --> 32:10.265
Look, I don't know what you're trying
to do here, but I've done nothing wrong.

32:10.328 --> 32:12.865
Then you wouldn't mind coming
downtown to make a formal statement.

32:15.433 --> 32:20.178
Look, I don't know how much buckshot she
has in her, but I can't get it all out.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.945
All I can do is bandage
her up for now.

32:22.006 --> 32:23.076
Her fever is worse.

32:23.141 --> 32:24.279
Use some ibuprofen.

32:24.642 --> 32:28.647
That's better than nothing, I guess.
Burdock root would be better.

32:29.847 --> 32:31.121
What are you doing?

32:32.016 --> 32:33.359
We need some help up here.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.988
You're not going to get
any service out here.

32:35.053 --> 32:37.363
Yeah, I know. I thought I'd try.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.870
One of us needs to go back.
You stay here.

32:47.932 --> 32:49.468
Wait, wait, wait.

32:49.534 --> 32:50.706
I don't think it's
such a great idea

32:50.768 --> 32:53.248
to take this girl back into
civilization right now.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.543
We've got to consider
the ramifications.

32:55.606 --> 32:57.279
Well, we can't leave
her in the woods.

32:57.542 --> 32:58.543
I mean, what are you going to do,

32:58.609 --> 33:00.316
live with her up here until
she's ready to come home?

33:00.545 --> 33:02.957
I don't think she knows
what she even is right now.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.793
She could hurt somebody.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.886
Well, she could hurt
somebody up here too.

33:06.951 --> 33:08.089
Monroe, she already has.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.063
He was trying to kill her, man!

33:10.421 --> 33:13.197
Right now she is the one who's hurt
and I cannot leave her up here.

33:16.995 --> 33:20.272
This is one of those rock and a
hard place type things, isn't it?

33:23.468 --> 33:25.311
I'll be back as soon as I can.

33:40.084 --> 33:42.189
Oh, you're burning up, kid.

33:46.124 --> 33:49.833
I'm going to get you some burdock root.
I'll be right back, okay?

33:51.662 --> 33:53.801
I'm going to take that as ayes.

33:54.499 --> 33:57.878
No, it's okay. It's okay.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.647
I'm coming right back.

34:03.141 --> 34:04.245
Okay.

34:31.601 --> 34:33.172
Where are you? I found her.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.847
I found Holly Clark. She's alive.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.677
Oh, my God. He found
Holly Clark alive.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.016
Yeah, but she's hurt bad.

34:40.143 --> 34:41.487
I'm going to need
some help out here.

34:41.545 --> 34:43.958
And I've got another problem, too.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.618
The Blake brothers are out here.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.321
I'm going to go on
foot to find them.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.197
Oh, one more thing.
Check a name for me.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.891
I found it on a camp
stove where I found her.

34:51.956 --> 34:52.956
What's the name?

34:53.257 --> 34:54.327
The name's Addison.

34:56.327 --> 34:59.740
He found a name on some camping
equipment where Holly was found.

35:01.666 --> 35:02.804
The name's Addison.

35:03.668 --> 35:05.614
Oh, my God! Keep her away from me.

35:06.003 --> 35:09.712
She bit me. She tried
to kill me! Help!

35:37.101 --> 35:38.580
He died here.

35:39.904 --> 35:40.974
Shh.

35:56.921 --> 35:59.128
Wait. He might not be alone.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.771
We want to get them all.

36:16.207 --> 36:18.517
Okay, this is burdock root.

36:20.411 --> 36:23.255
You chew on it, like this.

36:29.420 --> 36:30.592
There.

36:33.124 --> 36:36.867
No, no, no. I know it tastes
like an old tennis shoe.

36:37.595 --> 36:38.903
I mean, not that I've eaten
all that many of them,

36:38.963 --> 36:41.102
but, it's good for you, okay?

36:41.632 --> 36:43.305
Just nibble on it.

36:45.536 --> 36:49.040
Good, there you go.
It'll help your fever.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.115
Holly?

36:55.313 --> 36:56.383
Yes?

36:56.814 --> 36:58.293
I think everything's
going to be all right.

36:58.716 --> 37:02.095
You up there! Come down here now!

37:02.353 --> 37:04.390
No, no, no. Shh!

37:04.589 --> 37:05.863
Maybe you can't hear us!

37:06.891 --> 37:08.632
Whoa! Take it easy!

37:15.967 --> 37:18.004
Okay! I'm coming down!

37:18.236 --> 37:19.374
You stay here.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.042
I'm coming down!

37:27.845 --> 37:28.915
Shh.

37:44.762 --> 37:45.866
We saw you digging in the woods.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.567
Right near where our
brother was killed.

37:47.632 --> 37:49.077
How long you been living out here?

37:49.133 --> 37:52.512
Guys, we've got a
misunderstanding here, okay?

37:52.570 --> 37:55.414
I was on a hike, and I came
across this old place...

37:55.473 --> 37:56.611
What were you digging for?

37:58.009 --> 38:00.546
Well, and thank you for asking.

38:01.045 --> 38:03.025
It's called burdock root.

38:03.314 --> 38:05.021
It's a medicinal root,
and it's good for all kinds of...

38:05.082 --> 38:07.119
Why'd you kill our brother?

38:09.020 --> 38:11.022
Remember what I was just
saying about being on a hike?

38:11.088 --> 38:13.625
I could kill you right now,
and it might be a mistake,

38:13.691 --> 38:16.433
but I don't think I'd
lose any sleep over it.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.836
There's somebody else
up there. Who is it?

38:22.566 --> 38:25.479
There's nobody else up there.
I'm the only person here.

38:25.936 --> 38:29.406
When I find somebody up there,
you blow his head off.

38:44.422 --> 38:45.799
It's empty-

38:46.957 --> 38:48.265
Wait a minute.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.398
Delmar's sleeping bag and
his coat are up here.

39:01.439 --> 39:02.577
I'm going to cut your throat!

39:02.640 --> 39:03.641
Nobody move!

39:03.708 --> 39:06.279
Hey! This is the man
who killed our brother!

39:06.344 --> 39:07.789
He had nothing to do with it.

39:08.612 --> 39:10.455
He's my friend.
He came here with me.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.021
Put your weapons on the ground now.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.894
You shoot me,
he shoots your friend.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.132
Stay where you are.

39:23.561 --> 39:24.562
What was that?

39:27.264 --> 39:28.470
I don't know. Where?

40:17.014 --> 40:18.015
I have good news.

40:19.850 --> 40:20.885
We found Holly alive.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.728
What?

40:37.501 --> 40:40.880
Holly. Remember, you're not alone.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.452
Holly!

41:25.382 --> 41:26.554
Holly!

41:32.323 --> 41:33.597
Oh'

41:36.660 --> 41:38.367
It's okay, Holly. It's okay.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.031
It's okay.

41:48.572 --> 41:50.176
Come here, baby.

41:53.210 --> 41:54.553
It's okay.

42:11.562 --> 42:14.008
Two days ago, we made a
remarkable discovery.

42:14.431 --> 42:16.707
In the forest just
outside the city,

42:16.767 --> 42:20.237
we found Holly Clark,
missing for nine years, but alive.

42:21.171 --> 42:22.514
She's been reunited
with her mother,

42:22.573 --> 42:24.575
and we have a suspect in custody.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.856
She's pointing to Number Three.
