WEBVTT

00:06.233 --> 00:10.633
NARRATOR: Deep in Alaska,
the thaw has come,
but the land is alive.

00:10.667 --> 00:12.800
SUE:
Bears wake up, they're hungry.

00:12.833 --> 00:14.967
ANDY: You can see him
in the woods there.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.433
CHIP:
You fall out of the boat,
you could die.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.400
AGNES: Chip!

00:18.433 --> 00:20.567
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero...

00:20.600 --> 00:21.667
(WHOOPING)

00:21.700 --> 00:23.700
It's hunt or be hunted.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.400
ANDY: Worst thing to do
is turn and run.

00:25.433 --> 00:28.533
NARRATOR:
High in the Brooks Range,
the primal way lives on.

00:28.567 --> 00:32.033
It might be the last chance
I get to get a caribou.

00:32.067 --> 00:34.267
NARRATOR: Sue has 48 hours
to kill a bear.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.900
I got nothing
in the freezer right now.

00:35.933 --> 00:39.167
NARRATOR: And the Hailstones
brave a new frontier
for valuable fur.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.900
You don't get a second chance,
and we're flying by the seat
of our ass on this one.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.567
NARRATOR:
It's spring in Alaska.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.133
The bears are awake
and looking for food.

00:55.167 --> 00:59.800
And one just showed up
at Andy Bassich's
remote homestead.

00:59.833 --> 01:02.167
ANDY: Hyah! Get out of here!
Get out of here! Hyah!

01:02.200 --> 01:04.367
Come on, girl,
you've gotta stay inside.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.667
(ANDY SPEAKING)

01:20.133 --> 01:21.667
You have to be cautious
up here.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.367
You're on their turf
all the time.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.500
So you gotta be careful,
and you gotta be vigilant.

01:26.533 --> 01:29.333
Quite frankly,
they're intelligent,
they're predatory,

01:29.367 --> 01:31.533
and when they come out
of hibernation,
they're hungry.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.233
Where the hell did you go?

01:40.900 --> 01:42.633
Early in the springtime
up here,

01:42.667 --> 01:44.567
bears are our early meat.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.000
It's the first fresh meat that
we see after a long winter.

01:48.033 --> 01:50.933
He's in the yard here,
so he's gonna be
fuckin' dinner tonight.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.633
There he is.

02:07.033 --> 02:09.033
(COCKS RIFLE)

02:09.067 --> 02:11.600
I see him in the woods there.
Right here in the woods.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.767
NARRATOR:
If Andy doesn't get the bear
right now,

02:13.800 --> 02:16.367
it could return and
take him by surprise again.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.733
(GUNSHOT)

02:36.200 --> 02:39.467
Bad day for the bear,
good day for me.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.867
This bear didn't back down.

02:40.900 --> 02:42.867
He kept coming
even when I yelled at him.

02:42.900 --> 02:45.433
He wasn't afraid of me at all.

02:45.467 --> 02:48.867
Yeah, come here. Come here.
It's okay. Good girl!

02:48.900 --> 02:51.100
Good girl!
That's what I want you to do.

02:51.133 --> 02:53.133
When you smell those guys,
you gotta let me know.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.500
Actually, he's bigger
than I thought he was.

02:59.533 --> 03:01.700
Look at that. His paws
are as big as my hand.

03:03.067 --> 03:05.933
Looking at his hide,
looking at his teeth,

03:05.967 --> 03:07.667
he looks like
a really healthy bear,

03:07.700 --> 03:09.767
so this should be
some really good eating.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.500
It's really unusual for me
to see bears
this time of the year.

03:12.533 --> 03:15.400
I think that's why
I had my guards down
a little bit on this.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.400
There are a lot
of wild animals up here and...

03:18.800 --> 03:20.833
...you're on their turf
a lot of times.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.600
So you gotta be careful.

03:25.333 --> 03:28.700
All right, let's see
if we can't get this guy
drug in

03:28.733 --> 03:31.367
and start getting him
butchered up here.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.867
CHIP:
This is life without a clock.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.000
But if we don't get up and
make ourselves do this stuff,

03:39.033 --> 03:40.400
we're gonna suffer for it.

03:51.233 --> 03:53.567
You girls be safe,
and no going to the river.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.500
-No going to the beach at all.
-Yeah, I know.

03:57.333 --> 03:58.633
We'll see you
when we get a load.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.533
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

04:00.567 --> 04:04.667
NARRATOR: Chip and Agnes live
in an isolated native village
with their five daughters.

04:04.700 --> 04:09.133
Just putting food on the table
is a constant battle
in this harsh environment.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.133
CHIP: Where I live
beyond the end of the road,

04:13.167 --> 04:15.133
it's all hunting,
fishing and gathering.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.767
If I go to the store and
I get two small bags of food,

04:17.800 --> 04:19.367
I'm probably paying
a couple of hundred bucks.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.767
So the fact is we have to go
get the food ourselves.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.967
There's everything you need
to make a living out there.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.033
The river's broken up,

04:35.067 --> 04:36.333
and flood waters
came and went,

04:36.367 --> 04:37.500
and we're gonna go downriver

04:37.533 --> 04:39.067
and try
to catch up to the flood.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.767
And hopefully,
when we get there,

04:40.800 --> 04:43.800
we'll be able to hunt rats,
beavers, otters, fresh meats.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.067
Different change of diet.

04:46.433 --> 04:48.833
Right now
the muskrats and beavers

04:48.867 --> 04:50.867
are all out of their homes
and stuff.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.867
There're gonna be quite a few
out there,

04:52.900 --> 04:55.067
and hopefully,
this will be a good hunt.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.967
We have a flood come up,
and the flood forces out
all the animals.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.433
And as the flood
goes down again,

05:00.467 --> 05:02.200
those animals
have places to go and go hide.

05:02.233 --> 05:05.433
So it's imperative
that we be there when
the water's at its highest.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.500
The flood
has gone by here already.

05:09.533 --> 05:11.800
It's already starting
to recede.
The water's going down.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.700
So as we go downriver,
then we're gonna go
catch the flood

05:14.733 --> 05:16.833
where the ice is jamming,
where it will be solid ice.

05:21.133 --> 05:24.800
We're going to go to places
that are totally inaccessible
for the rest of the year.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.867
And that's where we got to be,
because out on the main rivers
there is nothing.

05:27.900 --> 05:31.133
Out on the big lakes,
wherever it's easy access,
there's nothing.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.733
So we're going
to the nooks and crannies

05:32.767 --> 05:34.433
'cause that's where
the animals are going to hide.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.467
We're kind of flying
by the seat of our ass
on this one.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.333
NARRATOR: Warmer temperatures
have broken up the ice

05:39.367 --> 05:42.767
on the Kobuk River,
creating dangerous chunks.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.667
One bad hit
could breach the boat's hull.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.000
(AGNES SPEAKS)

05:49.033 --> 05:50.200
Slow down!

05:53.333 --> 05:54.600
Slowly!

05:55.200 --> 05:56.733
Slowly!

06:05.000 --> 06:06.667
CHIP: Very soon
the water will go down,

06:06.700 --> 06:09.500
and we won't have access
to the really shallow places.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.233
And the muskrats will
start fighting each other,

06:11.267 --> 06:12.767
and they'll be putting holes
in their skins.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.100
And when they start
doing that,

06:14.133 --> 06:16.100
the hunt is over.

06:16.133 --> 06:17.800
The skins,
they can make into parkas.

06:17.833 --> 06:21.800
And if we can get 120 rats,
we'd have enough
for about three adult parkas.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.733
And to us,
that's 15,000 bucks.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.367
It's not a hunt
you want to screw up.

06:34.900 --> 06:38.967
It's fun to change seasons.
We got off our snow machines,
we get in our boats.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.633
This is our first good boating
this year.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.300
So that's what makes it
more exciting
than anything else,

06:44.333 --> 06:46.500
is that the change
of transportation.

06:46.533 --> 06:48.167
It is blazing hot.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.400
It's got to be, like,
at least 40 degrees.

06:50.433 --> 06:54.900
And we don't have any chances
of freezing to death
unless we get wet first.

06:56.167 --> 06:59.800
So that kind of narrows down
everything we're doing.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.367
It makes everything better.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.533
We got four months
to get up enough food

07:03.567 --> 07:06.167
to get us through winter
without having to buy
a bunch of food.

07:10.233 --> 07:14.033
GLENN: I hunt to live
'cause that's how I get
most of the food I eat.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.967
It's a part of my life
every day.

07:17.067 --> 07:18.400
The cycle of life and death.

07:27.867 --> 07:31.133
I'm thinking about going out
and looking for
something to eat today.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.700
I could use
another caribou this spring.

07:33.733 --> 07:36.767
NARRATOR: Glenn Villeneuve
left the lower 48
and moved to Alaska,

07:36.800 --> 07:38.833
where he's carved out
a primitive existence

07:38.867 --> 07:41.733
in the high mountains
of the Brooks Range.

07:41.767 --> 07:44.533
GLENN: I live about 200 miles
from the nearest city

07:44.567 --> 07:47.467
and a 60-mile walk
from the nearest road.

07:49.167 --> 07:50.400
I live by myself.

07:50.433 --> 07:52.633
I'm hunting, trapping,
fishing.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.300
NARRATOR: Glenn makes his way
in the wild

07:54.333 --> 07:56.267
almost entirely by hand.

07:57.367 --> 08:00.333
No machines, little fuel,

08:00.367 --> 08:03.400
powered by his own two feet
over miles of mountains

08:03.433 --> 08:06.233
in search of
every bit of food he eats.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.200
GLENN: And nine years ago
I walked out here

08:08.233 --> 08:11.500
because it was the last place
in the world where I thought
I could live like this.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.533
I lived in Berlin.
I've lived in New York City.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.300
After living out here,

08:16.333 --> 08:19.900
I think I'd feel like I was
living in a hamster cage
if I went down there again.

08:19.933 --> 08:23.000
NARRATOR:
It's an existence that makes
even the simplest task

08:23.033 --> 08:25.667
a life and death
struggle for survival.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.767
GLENN:
Spring is a transition time

08:27.800 --> 08:30.967
because the caribou leave
and things really change here.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.267
Up on top of those ridges,
right on the skyline there,

08:34.300 --> 08:36.900
is where the caribou
like to travel a lot of times.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.333
Didn't see anything
looking around today
from down here,

08:39.367 --> 08:42.800
so I'm gonna head up
the mountain and see if I can
find something up there.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.200
NARRATOR: But every hunt means

08:44.233 --> 08:48.233
the choice between
finding food and leaving
his camp unprotected.

08:48.267 --> 08:49.900
Living out here alone,

08:49.933 --> 08:53.467
there's always a risk of
a bear coming and ripping up
my camp when I'm gone.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.033
All I can do
is secure things a little bit.

08:57.567 --> 09:00.500
When I'm around camp,
I can chase 'em away.

09:00.533 --> 09:02.967
But just a chance
I have to take when I'm gone.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.667
I try to pack
as light as I can.

09:06.700 --> 09:09.600
For butchering,
I got my main hunting knife

09:09.633 --> 09:12.267
and this little hatchet
comes in handy.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.967
I'm going to carry
a .22 today.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.367
I'm also gonna take
the .30-06.

09:18.400 --> 09:22.067
If there're no caribou,
there's always the chance
of finding a grizzly bear.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.233
This is really hungry country
up here.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.867
It's the Arctic,
and life is spread really thin
over the land.

09:36.267 --> 09:38.833
The only way I can find
enough food to eat out here

09:38.867 --> 09:41.533
is to keep really close track
of the territory I hunt,

09:41.567 --> 09:45.867
watching all the time
and walking all the time.

09:45.900 --> 09:49.667
I hunt from the ridge tops
all along that side
of the valley

09:49.700 --> 09:51.733
to the ridge tops
all along this side
of the valley.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.600
It's an area
of about 60 square miles.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.767
I have to come up here,

09:56.800 --> 10:00.200
because from my lake
down there,
I can only see this side.

10:00.233 --> 10:04.300
A lot of times there are
caribou just along the ridge,
a little bit out of view.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.800
I can see
some caribou tracks now.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.133
Looks like a big group.

10:10.167 --> 10:13.267
Might have been
a couple of hundred caribou.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.933
Look at all these spots
where they peed in the snow.

10:19.933 --> 10:23.200
There's an antler
shed right there.

10:24.733 --> 10:27.133
Yeah, there were caribou here.

10:27.167 --> 10:30.367
We just didn't
intercept them today but...

10:30.400 --> 10:32.667
I probably climb up
this mountain 10 times

10:32.700 --> 10:36.067
without seeing caribou
for every time I come up here
and there is a caribou around.

10:36.100 --> 10:39.833
NARRATOR:
In spring, the caribou migrate
from the 6,000-foot peaks

10:39.867 --> 10:43.167
to the calving grounds
in the foothills
and out of Glenn's reach.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.767
GLENN: There might not be
another caribou in this valley
for months now.

10:50.367 --> 10:53.900
SUE: Some people can handle
the challenge of being
a food group,

10:53.933 --> 10:55.300
some people can't.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.800
You're either
the mouse or the lion.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.167
It's time to find out
which one.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.967
This is not winter any more.

11:13.167 --> 11:14.967
It's a whole new world.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.500
Instantly when I hear "thaw,"
my brain says,

11:17.533 --> 11:22.700
"Holy shit. I only have
two-and-a-half months to get
all my shit ready for winter."

11:22.733 --> 11:27.167
NARRATOR: Sue has only
48 hours to hunt a bear before
the season officially closes.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.100
And with
a nearly empty freezer,

11:29.133 --> 11:32.233
this is a kill
she desperately needs.

11:32.267 --> 11:34.667
SUE:
I live at Kavik River Camp
up on the north slope.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.600
My closest neighbour
would be 350 miles south.

11:37.633 --> 11:40.633
I've recently bought Kavik
instead of just working here.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.067
I'm now the owner,

11:42.100 --> 11:44.067
and it comes
with a tremendous amount
of pressure

11:44.100 --> 11:46.167
because if I don't do well
this summer,

11:46.200 --> 11:48.333
I may not be here next season.

11:48.367 --> 11:51.600
And it's critical for me
to get meat

11:51.633 --> 11:54.467
'cause the grocery stores
are 500 miles away,

11:54.500 --> 11:58.733
and in the dead of winter,
I can hunt,
but there's nothing to hunt.

11:58.767 --> 12:02.167
But now my bears wake up.
They're hungry.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.033
The caribou are
supposed to be migrating in.
They're late.

I like my lever-action guns.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.600
But I've saved up my money
and bought myself
what I call the equalizer.

12:19.633 --> 12:21.400

12:21.433 --> 12:25.900
It is a gun that as quickly
as I can pull the trigger

12:25.933 --> 12:27.567
another bullet will come out.

12:28.933 --> 12:30.733
Every situation you have

12:30.767 --> 12:32.333
with your predator
is different.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.333
I might be some bear's dinner,

12:34.367 --> 12:36.233
but it's an acceptable risk

they don't deserve to have me
in their lives.

12:50.967 --> 12:53.700
'Cause the bear
is probably looking
at his own regulations, going,

12:53.733 --> 12:56.100
"Hey, it's still Sue season.
Awesome."

12:56.133 --> 12:58.000
I mean, I know more
than most people

12:58.033 --> 13:00.833
exactly how dangerous
these animals can be.

13:01.733 --> 13:03.467
About five, six years ago,

13:03.500 --> 13:05.333
smart bear who was hiding
in the cut bank

13:05.367 --> 13:08.367
and reached out
and snatched me and
was just rolling me around.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.167
I mean, you can still feel
here and here

13:11.200 --> 13:12.633
where his teeth
went into my head.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.300
The hips were torn out
of the socket,

13:14.333 --> 13:16.067
and he slipped out
over the bank.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.367
The hips did not hold,

13:18.400 --> 13:20.500
and I ended up
having to drag myself up

13:20.533 --> 13:24.833
from halfway across the river,
um, and got inside.

13:24.867 --> 13:26.367
And I just had to lay here.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.267
And it took 10 days
for somebody to find me.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.367

13:31.400 --> 13:33.600
that I may be
bear crap any day.

walk out there

14:07.233 --> 14:09.233

14:09.267 --> 14:12.333
Or did he manage
to get past me,
and he's way far away?

14:12.367 --> 14:14.033

14:18.333 --> 14:20.700
I got nothing
in the freezer right now.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.200
At midnight tomorrow,

14:25.233 --> 14:28.200

opportunity to get a bear,

put some meat in the freezer.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.833
Well, I either see a bear
or a moose,

14:35.867 --> 14:37.833
another god damn
mile that way.

14:39.867 --> 14:41.800
So, it's time to get
some meat.

14:42.867 --> 14:44.667
Daylight's a-burning.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.967
For me to survive,
I have to hunt
for the meat that I eat.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.433
So, I'm worried
about getting that bear.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.067
Finally see
the big dark shape.

14:58.533 --> 15:00.700
He's right over there.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.233
Quarter mile, half mile.

15:02.267 --> 15:03.300
It's a moose.

15:05.067 --> 15:09.700
But I can't shoot that moose.
It's not moose season,
it's bear season.

15:09.733 --> 15:13.200
So no matter how badly
I need the meat,
he walks free.

15:17.467 --> 15:19.467
I got 40 hours left
of the season.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.500
But I took a chance.

15:22.533 --> 15:25.233
It's the people that
don't take a chance,

15:25.267 --> 15:26.600
those are the ones
I feel sorry for.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.067
ANDY:
I like to be self-sufficient.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.967
The outside world
could totally implode,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.667
and we'll be
in good shape here.

15:45.567 --> 15:49.800
In the springtime,
we are out of meat usually,

15:49.833 --> 15:53.367
and we're looking to start
providing for the next year.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.733
And I learnt a long time ago

15:55.767 --> 15:58.800
that when something
presents itself
as an opportunity...

16:00.567 --> 16:03.467
...if you pass it up thinking,
"Oh, I'll go get
the next one,"

16:03.500 --> 16:05.433
the next one never comes.

16:05.467 --> 16:08.000
This bear presented himself
as an opportunity...

16:09.167 --> 16:11.133
...and I took advantage of it,

16:11.167 --> 16:13.600
and it's gonna be
a big pay-off in the long run.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.233
What did I shoot?
Three rounds?

16:17.267 --> 16:19.667
So, this bear cost me
about $1.50

16:19.700 --> 16:24.033
for 80 to 100 pounds of meat
off this bear.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.333
So, that's
pretty good economics.

16:27.933 --> 16:30.167
You can't buy a cup of coffee
for that.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.233
And I can tan this hide up,

16:33.267 --> 16:35.067
and if I want,
I can sell this hide,

16:35.100 --> 16:37.100
or I can trade with somebody
for this hide.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.733
So there's barter value in it.

16:39.767 --> 16:42.300
The claws will be made
into jewellery.

16:42.333 --> 16:45.000
The main canine teeth
will be pulled,

16:45.033 --> 16:47.200
and I'll be making jewellery
out of those.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.267
When I'm all done,

16:49.300 --> 16:52.567
the only thing that goes
to waste on this whole animal
is the blood.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.867
Here's all the fat.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.433
This is gut fat we call it.

16:55.467 --> 16:59.367
And it's really the sweet fat
for rendering.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.433
Out in this country,
we crave fat.

17:02.467 --> 17:06.767
In cities people want
a fat-free diet,
but out here fat is energy.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.533
I've got the lungs...

17:10.733 --> 17:12.300
...and the heart right here.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.033
This heart will be good,
good eating.

17:16.067 --> 17:19.300
It's a good start
on the summer
to have some fresh meat here.

17:19.333 --> 17:22.167
We're not gonna be able
to hunt moose until...

17:22.200 --> 17:25.000
The first season
is in late August.

17:25.033 --> 17:27.733
So one bear is gonna feed

17:27.767 --> 17:29.967

23:48.433 --> 23:50.500
getting firewood,
getting water.

23:53.367 --> 23:54.700
I don't have plumbing.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.100
I get my water
out of the lake.

23:56.133 --> 23:58.267
It takes a significant amount
of time and energy

23:58.300 --> 23:59.667
compared to
turning a faucet on.

24:02.167 --> 24:03.867
NARRATOR: Getting to
Glenn's water supply

24:03.900 --> 24:06.700
requires constant effort
using hand tools.

24:11.933 --> 24:13.667
All I have to worry about now

24:13.700 --> 24:15.900
is that my arms
can do the job.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.767
Boy, I don't really know
just how thick it is,

24:20.800 --> 24:22.367
but I'd guess
it might be four feet.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.433
NARRATOR: Glenn needs water,

24:32.467 --> 24:34.500
but right now
he needs food more.

24:35.567 --> 24:38.833
And he has to get close enough
to make the shot.

24:40.167 --> 24:41.167
Whoo!

24:42.133 --> 24:43.500
Whoo!

24:45.167 --> 24:46.833
Whoo!

24:46.867 --> 24:49.500
NARRATOR: The last caribou
of the season
is in Glenn's sight.

24:49.533 --> 24:53.033
But his chance to get
close enough to kill it
is slipping away.

24:54.567 --> 24:56.733
GLENN:
Not a whole lot of caribou
left around here right now.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.300
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

25:08.567 --> 25:10.167
(GUNSHOT)

25:15.433 --> 25:17.000
(GUNSHOT)

25:21.733 --> 25:23.400
Both shots missed.

25:24.767 --> 25:26.133
(WHOOPING)

25:28.367 --> 25:31.833
NARRATOR: Caribou have large
hooves that prevent them
from sinking in the snow,

25:31.867 --> 25:35.133
making it easy
to outrun Glenn
on the frozen lake.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.233
Whoo!

25:38.767 --> 25:40.833
Whoo!

25:40.867 --> 25:43.500
GLENN: Sometimes
I've been able to get caribou
come in pretty close

25:43.533 --> 25:45.300
just by yelling like that.

25:45.333 --> 25:49.233
I'll run right at 'em and yell
and try to bounce my voice
off the shoreline.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.867
(WHOOPING)

25:53.200 --> 25:56.333
And you sometimes get 'em
to stop and turn towards you,

25:56.367 --> 26:00.300
get 'em to come
in 75 yards or so
while you're doing that.

26:00.333 --> 26:02.233
Unfortunately,
this one didn't work out.

26:15.967 --> 26:18.833
Looks like my ice hole
filled up with water
while I was gone.

26:20.467 --> 26:22.700
I can't stand
in the hole any more,

26:22.733 --> 26:25.200
so I just have to use
a longer chisel.

26:25.233 --> 26:27.233
And it's a little bit harder
on my back.

26:27.267 --> 26:29.433
NARRATOR: Water has seeped in
through a small crack.

26:29.467 --> 26:31.733
If Glenn doesn't make
a large, clean hole,

26:31.767 --> 26:34.867
it will freeze over,
and he will have
to start again tomorrow.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.533
GLENN: I thought that might be
the last chance I get

26:47.567 --> 26:48.933
at a caribou this spring.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.733
So I decided to take a shot

26:53.767 --> 26:56.200
that was gonna be
pretty difficult

26:56.233 --> 26:58.167
considering how out of breath
I was.

27:01.833 --> 27:03.867
It's too bad.
I would have liked
to get that.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.600
I might not have
another chance this spring.

27:06.633 --> 27:09.633
Most of them
seem to have headed
further north now.

27:16.267 --> 27:19.433
SUE: Best possible scenario,
I get meat and I don't starve.

27:19.467 --> 27:22.267
The worst is,
bear gets meat and gets Sue.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.900
It's the last day
of bear season.
It ends at midnight tonight.

27:34.933 --> 27:37.567
And I've got that much
in my freezer.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.900
NARRATOR: If Sue kills a bear
out of season,

27:39.933 --> 27:42.567
she could face fines
and criminal charges.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.100
This is her last chance.

27:47.367 --> 27:48.700
SUE: There he is.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.500
Let's keep going.

27:54.133 --> 27:56.167
There's an area just up here.

27:56.200 --> 27:59.567
I nicknamed it Bear Creek
and Caribou Crossing.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.833
That's where I'm gonna hit.

28:00.867 --> 28:04.467
But I only got
about six more hours
and the season closes,

28:04.500 --> 28:06.267
so I gotta fill the freezer.

28:06.300 --> 28:09.900
So much more than just
"Bam, bam, bam, bam."

28:09.933 --> 28:13.900
If that's your only goal,
I mean, you're missing
the whole picture.

28:15.933 --> 28:20.033
Up here, I mean, a lot
of my inland grizzlies
are 800 pounds of meat.

28:20.067 --> 28:23.100
That's a lot for a fat chick
to cut up and haul back.

28:23.133 --> 28:24.867
But spring bear's real tasty.

28:25.867 --> 28:28.767
And I have so many uses
for the bear.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.033
It'd be great to have
some more warm fur,

28:31.067 --> 28:33.700
some fat so I can make
soap and shampoo and stuff.

28:39.767 --> 28:43.333
I'm worried that I got snow
and I got fog coming in
from the north.

28:43.367 --> 28:47.733
I'm not liking that
'cause if that drops in,
I can't see.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.533
I'm very limited.

28:49.567 --> 28:55.333
But that bear can switch
from eyes to nose
and still be god-damn dead on.

28:55.367 --> 28:59.433
He can smell what direction
I'm in and just
go charging and bowl me over.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.067
I won't be able see.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.867
NARRATOR:
Grizzly bears can lose
40% of their body weight

29:03.900 --> 29:06.033
during their
six-month hibernation.

29:06.067 --> 29:07.767
When they emerge
in the spring,

29:07.800 --> 29:10.500
they will eat as much as
90 pounds of food a day.

29:10.533 --> 29:13.167
They can be blinded
by their hunger.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.867
SUE: I'm on his menu.

29:14.900 --> 29:18.333
He may have a Sue tag,
so I've gotta keep
my little peepers peeled.

29:18.367 --> 29:21.667
That son of bitch will jump me
just as much as
I wanna jump him.

29:25.933 --> 29:28.567
We got deep snow
over there again.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.167
And the snow might blow
this whole friggin' hunt...

29:32.200 --> 29:34.900
...'cause where I wanna go
is covered in too much snow.

29:35.733 --> 29:37.100
The other place...

29:39.700 --> 29:43.000
Other place I want to go?
Can't get across the river.

29:46.267 --> 29:48.700
Kind of boned.
A little bit boned.

29:53.133 --> 29:55.700
ANDY: Transitioning now
from winter to summer.

29:55.733 --> 29:58.600
We have four months
to prepare for a whole year.

29:58.633 --> 30:00.633
Now, the real work begins.

30:10.033 --> 30:12.000
All right,
let's go get some dogs.

30:13.933 --> 30:17.633
NARRATOR:
A few weeks ago, Andy and Kate
evacuated 25 of their dogs

30:17.667 --> 30:20.833
when the ice
on the Yukon River
started to melt and break up,

30:20.867 --> 30:24.567
threatening to flood
and destroy their homestead.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.967
In the 2009 flood,
one of their dogs drowned.

30:30.033 --> 30:34.867
This year the dogs were taken
to the safety of the nearest
town, 14 miles upriver.

30:35.567 --> 30:36.700
ANDY: Come on over here.

30:36.733 --> 30:38.767
You're such a good girl.

30:38.800 --> 30:43.467
In the summertime
their job is to be
our alarm system here.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.700
Early in the spring
is when we see
a lot of bears in this area

30:46.733 --> 30:50.633
and when we have all of our
dogs here, the bears can't
come anywhere near us

30:50.667 --> 30:52.300
without the dogs picking up
the scent

30:52.333 --> 30:54.100
and giving us
a really good warning.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.033
KATE: Today is a good day.

30:56.633 --> 30:57.767
We get our puppies home.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.533
These dogs work for us,

30:59.567 --> 31:02.233
they pull sleds,
they pull water.

31:02.267 --> 31:03.600
They're our world.

31:03.633 --> 31:06.267
I'm excited.
I just can't wait!

31:07.100 --> 31:08.500
Come on, Uzo!

31:08.533 --> 31:11.100
-Up, up, good boy!
-Come on.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.400
-Come on. Heavy guy.
-Come on.

31:15.433 --> 31:18.100
-Come on, Gambo.
-Quick, Gambo.

31:18.133 --> 31:20.300
Come on, Iceberg! Come on, Ti!

31:20.333 --> 31:21.733
You guys ready to go home?

31:24.233 --> 31:25.733
Let's go home.

31:29.567 --> 31:32.267
This is the first boat ride
for a lot of these dogs.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.967
My biggest concern coming down
the river is that the weight

31:35.000 --> 31:36.833
shifts in the boats

31:36.867 --> 31:39.900
and if we were to tip these
boats and swamp them,

31:39.933 --> 31:41.467
everybody would be gone.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.467
All the dogs are chained in
real tight to these lines

31:44.500 --> 31:46.433
so that they can't shift
their weight too far

31:46.467 --> 31:48.767
to one side or the other.

31:48.800 --> 31:52.933
And this is a big river,
and it moves fast up here.

31:52.967 --> 31:55.433
It's got a lot of power.

31:55.467 --> 31:59.000
NARRATOR: The Yukon River
is notorious for extreme
eddies and undercurrents

31:59.033 --> 32:01.367
that have already claimed
one life this year.

32:01.400 --> 32:04.300
ANDY: When you're out here
in the middle of the river,
there's nothing you can do

32:04.333 --> 32:06.400
to change anything
if things go bad.

32:06.433 --> 32:09.333
NARRATOR:
With only four miles to go,
Andy is nearly home.

32:09.367 --> 32:11.067
But on the
unpredictable Yukon,

32:11.100 --> 32:12.833
nothing is guaranteed.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.900
(BARKING)

32:15.933 --> 32:17.600
Hold on, hold on.

32:17.633 --> 32:19.067
These dogs are, you know,

32:19.100 --> 32:21.067
we do a lot of different
things with them

32:21.100 --> 32:25.067
so they're pretty used to
being exposed to new ideas

32:25.100 --> 32:28.533
and new adventures
and new things.

32:28.567 --> 32:32.200
Once they get the hang of it,
it doesn't take them very long

32:32.233 --> 32:36.000
to settle right in
and enjoy the ride.

32:37.933 --> 32:39.567
Every week out of the year

32:39.600 --> 32:42.300
the Yukon River is a different
place to be on.

32:42.333 --> 32:45.833
And it's just something about
rivers, they just seem alive.

32:45.867 --> 32:50.000
My whole life revolves around
the Yukon River and dogs.

32:50.033 --> 32:52.600
Go, Gecko, go! On the beach!

32:52.633 --> 32:54.700
-(DOG WHIMPERS)
-Come on, Keith.

32:54.733 --> 32:57.000
Good, take the rest
of those guys with you!

32:58.500 --> 32:59.533
KATE: Come here, girl!

33:01.100 --> 33:02.400
Drachma!

33:02.433 --> 33:03.433
(DOGS BARKING)

33:05.200 --> 33:07.333
It's exciting for
the dogs to come home.

33:07.367 --> 33:10.400
Come on, Crim. Come on.
At a boy, good boy.

33:10.433 --> 33:11.867
Peso!

33:11.900 --> 33:13.000
Hey, Shilling!

33:14.800 --> 33:15.867
Come here, Shilling.

33:15.900 --> 33:17.967
I know,
it's so much excitement.

33:19.367 --> 33:22.267
GLENN: Out here
physical work has meaning.

33:23.067 --> 33:25.400
You feed yourself.

33:25.433 --> 33:28.367
It's work just to go to
the bathroom out here.

33:34.867 --> 33:39.000
NARRATOR: Glenn sustains
himself primarily on
animal protein and fat,

33:39.033 --> 33:41.933
but he's down to his
last reserves from winter.

33:41.967 --> 33:45.200
Every bit of food he acquires
is critical to his survival.

33:45.233 --> 33:48.533
GLENN:
A lot of my energy goes into
getting food out here.

33:48.567 --> 33:50.167
And not only getting the food,

33:50.200 --> 33:53.600
but preserving the food,
preparing the food,

33:53.633 --> 33:55.200
eating the food.

33:55.233 --> 33:58.733
We're gonna take a couple
of these heads and
get them thawing out

33:58.767 --> 34:00.933
so we can skin
'em and...

34:02.233 --> 34:03.467
...eat 'em.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.767
There's a lot of good food
inside the head of caribou

34:06.800 --> 34:08.200
or inside the head
of any animal.

34:08.233 --> 34:12.800
Here are some foetuses
from the four cows

34:12.833 --> 34:14.700
that I killed this year.

34:14.733 --> 34:17.467
You can eat just about
the whole thing.

34:17.500 --> 34:20.767
When you're eating mostly
animals for food

34:20.800 --> 34:22.867
and not too much
in the way of plants...

34:24.133 --> 34:27.933
...you need to eat as much fat
as you can find usually

34:27.967 --> 34:29.600
or you'll get really sick.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.367
There's the eyeball
right there,

34:33.400 --> 34:37.233
and right behind that eye
there's gonna be
a nice chunk of fat.

34:37.267 --> 34:41.433
And then you can start to pull
out some of that eye fat.

34:41.467 --> 34:43.400
That right there
is just delicious fat.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.200
Mmm!

34:48.833 --> 34:50.633
That's really delicious fat.

34:52.933 --> 34:55.767
I've never gotten sick eating
anything raw off the caribou.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.367
I eat a lot of different
parts of caribou raw.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.200
I eat it raw
if tastes better to me raw.

35:00.233 --> 35:02.167
And if it's a part that tastes
better to me cooked,

35:02.200 --> 35:04.133
I cook it.

35:04.167 --> 35:05.533
I got a considerable
amount of fat right there.

35:05.567 --> 35:08.800
I mean, that's like a stick
of butter, you know,

35:08.833 --> 35:12.033
that was right behind
that caribou's eyeballs.

35:12.067 --> 35:15.200
I'm also gonna take the
brain out and fry the brain.

35:15.233 --> 35:17.667
I just happen to like brains
fried best.

35:20.733 --> 35:22.033
There!
Right through the brain.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.900
Boil up the eyeballs.

35:29.033 --> 35:31.333
And the brains
I just scoop out.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.167
They probably look like
scrambled eggs

35:39.200 --> 35:40.933
to a lot of people.

35:43.267 --> 35:44.267
Mmm.

35:46.167 --> 35:47.333
I really like brains.

35:47.367 --> 35:49.733
There's a lot of muscle,
but there's only one
little brain

35:49.767 --> 35:51.433
that you can eat up
in one meal,

35:51.467 --> 35:53.167
so it makes it extra special.

35:54.267 --> 35:55.700
It's pretty powerful food.

35:55.733 --> 35:59.700
You eat this stuff and you got
energy to run these mountains

35:59.733 --> 36:01.267
and look for more
of this food.

36:01.300 --> 36:03.567
If I was eating store-bought
food I don't know if I would
be able

36:03.600 --> 36:05.533
to get around
these mountains the way I do.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.233
CHIP: We're hunters,
and the thing for us to do

36:12.267 --> 36:14.433
is to make the most
of every opportunity.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.433
People call it work,
I just call it living.

36:26.567 --> 36:28.700
We haven't done very
well seeing muskrats.

36:28.733 --> 36:30.000
We've been coming across
a lot of beaver,

36:30.033 --> 36:31.733
so there's always
something in the gap.

36:36.900 --> 36:39.433
-What's that, Agnes?
-A beaver?

36:39.467 --> 36:42.000
Muskrat! Oh, there it is!

36:42.033 --> 36:43.233
Shoot it.

36:43.933 --> 36:45.500
He's going right up there.

36:45.533 --> 36:47.467
I can't get
a clear view of it.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.133
CHIP:
Right by the base of the tree.

36:49.167 --> 36:51.733
I can't see
which way it's heading.

36:51.767 --> 36:53.800
I have the sun in my eyes.

36:54.667 --> 36:55.867
Oh, there it is!

36:57.300 --> 36:59.867
CHIP: He's going under us!
He's coming right to you!

36:59.900 --> 37:02.600
He'll come up over here.
Go ahead!

37:03.467 --> 37:04.767
AGNES: There it is!

NARRATOR:
Muskrats have partially-webbed
feet and a tail

37:07.233 --> 37:08.867

through the water...

37:08.900 --> 37:10.267

a difficult target to hit.

37:20.433 --> 37:21.900
CHIP: When you're shooting
a rifle, you miss.

37:21.933 --> 37:23.467
The animal doesn't
always cooperate.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.033
Quite often the
animal's moving

37:25.067 --> 37:28.067
and shooting at something and
missing is very, very common.

37:28.100 --> 37:29.567
Thirteen shots.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.633
You know why you're missing
so high it's because that

37:31.667 --> 37:34.367
-thing's aimed
for about 100 yards.
-Yeah.

37:34.400 --> 37:35.633
CHIP: It always matters
when you waste ammo.

37:35.667 --> 37:36.900
I mean, you're wasting
your time,

37:36.933 --> 37:40.033
you're wasting metals
and propellants,
and you're wasting money

37:40.067 --> 37:42.867
'cause that stuff
costs a lot nowadays.

37:42.900 --> 37:45.667
Ammo's crazy!
Shall we carry on?

37:55.233 --> 37:56.900
CHIP: He's way ahead of us,
you see him?

37:56.933 --> 37:59.867
CHIP: He's got his head up.
AGNES: Oh, it's coming.
Just stay still.

37:59.900 --> 38:01.400

(GUNSHOT)

38:08.733 --> 38:10.067

38:13.967 --> 38:15.033

(AGNES SPEAKS)

38:20.433 --> 38:22.033
Oh, you got him.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.800
-I saw that.
-Right in its back.

38:24.833 --> 38:26.433
CHIP: That's the first rat
of the year so far!

38:33.067 --> 38:34.733
Right here. There you go.

38:36.367 --> 38:38.933
Look, there's another muskrat!

38:38.967 --> 38:40.567
Way up front, you see it?

38:40.600 --> 38:42.833
CHIP:
That's a full-grown adult.
Get it!

38:45.433 --> 38:46.700
(GUNSHOT)

38:55.267 --> 38:57.300
That's a decent sized muskrat.

38:59.633 --> 39:01.167
That was a good one!

39:08.033 --> 39:09.800
NARRATOR: To prevent the meat
from spoiling,

39:09.833 --> 39:12.000
Chip and Agnes
must skin and gut their kill

before the long journey home.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.800
(AGNES SIGHS)

39:17.000 --> 39:19.700
I feel like this was
a successful hunt.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.367
-This has been successful!
-Yep!

When you have days like
we've got now, nice and hot,

39:25.067 --> 39:27.567
probably 50 degrees,

this is, this is one of the
better times of year.

39:34.767 --> 39:36.633
Check out your
beaver pelts, girls.

39:36.667 --> 39:37.667
High five.

39:38.833 --> 39:40.667
Come down here and check
out what we got for you girls!

39:40.700 --> 39:41.767
No way.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.500
Are those baby beavers?

39:43.533 --> 39:45.600
-That's a muskrat!
-That's a muskrat!

39:47.500 --> 39:50.467
-Now these are beavers!
-His eyes look nasty.

39:51.767 --> 39:54.167
Help us clean up
the boat, please.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.667
CHIP: We didn't catch
much muskrat,

39:55.700 --> 39:57.933
so we settled for beaver
and did very well with those.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.867
Let's go, girls.

40:00.900 --> 40:04.400
CHIP: When you go hunting,
you can't say I'm after
one specific thing.

40:04.433 --> 40:06.067
We hunt what is available
and what we can use

40:06.100 --> 40:08.167
at that time of season
and that time of year,

40:08.200 --> 40:11.400
and we're just opportunists
'cause we're hunters.

40:12.833 --> 40:14.667
SUE: I'm not exactly
the cookie-baking,

40:14.700 --> 40:16.733
knit-you-a-sweater
type of grandma.

40:16.767 --> 40:18.433
I am the king of Kavik.

40:30.467 --> 40:33.000
This is the last day of
hunting on the bear season.

40:33.033 --> 40:35.200
And big game
fills up your freezer.

40:35.233 --> 40:38.000
So if I don't get a bear
in the next three hours,

40:38.033 --> 40:40.967
the season ends and that's it
until the next season opens.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.900
It doesn't sink in that,

40:47.933 --> 40:51.900
"Aw, I'm a grandma
and I'm actually 500 miles
from safety

40:51.933 --> 40:53.433
"and I'm hunting
grizzly bears.

40:53.467 --> 40:55.767
"What the hell are
you thinking?"
I don't think that way.

40:57.067 --> 40:59.567
I see it very much like
somebody that might go,

40:59.600 --> 41:03.167
"Oh, yeah, don't forget to
stop off at the five and dime

41:03.200 --> 41:05.033
"and pick up milk
on the way home."

41:05.067 --> 41:07.667
For me, it's like,
"Oh, yeah, bear hunting,
I gotta get it done."

41:07.700 --> 41:09.767
But, you know,
I'm chasing a needle
in a haystack

41:09.800 --> 41:12.500
and hoping to see
if they stuck by the river,

41:12.533 --> 41:15.200
I'd be able to see
some tracks, some poop,
something.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.833
I don't even see any sign,
the hunting is just,

41:18.867 --> 41:20.633
I don't think very good
upriver.

41:28.467 --> 41:32.700
I'm now officially down
just below the final hour.

41:32.733 --> 41:35.633
And there's a couple of dots
of interest down this way...

41:37.233 --> 41:38.900
...and that's three
hours of journey.

41:38.933 --> 41:41.333
So, I'm not gonna go chasing
off across the tundra,

41:41.367 --> 41:47.100
but I've got zero game meat
left and I needed to get it,
I wanted to get it.

41:47.133 --> 41:49.600
But I don't live my life
dwelling on the negative.

41:51.500 --> 41:54.533
Well, I mean, this is it.
The bear season's over.

41:54.567 --> 41:58.467
Land of the midnight sun.
I mean there's my alarm clock.
It's midnight and it's done.

41:58.500 --> 42:00.167
So the bear wins.

42:00.200 --> 42:03.300
So the next challenge is
getting enough small game.

42:03.333 --> 42:07.033
Always nicer when you can put
pound packages in your freezer

42:07.067 --> 42:11.467
but, you know, I'll just start
doing it bite by bite.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.033
Life just got a little harder.

42:18.067 --> 42:20.233
ANDY: We spend a lot of time
working with these dogs

42:20.267 --> 42:23.467
and providing for these dogs
but they provide for us, too.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.067
It's a real
symbiotic relationship

42:26.100 --> 42:27.133
we have with them.

42:32.700 --> 42:35.500
Hey, Gamble,
come here, Gamble.

42:35.533 --> 42:37.400
Well, they're all happy
to be home.

42:37.433 --> 42:39.000
It's good to have these
guys home again.

42:39.033 --> 42:40.700
It's a whole different feeling
when the dogs are here

42:40.733 --> 42:42.067
as when they're not.

42:42.100 --> 42:45.567
-Yep
-It's like empty-nest
syndrome.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.200
You want bear ribs
for dinner tonight?

42:47.233 --> 42:48.667
Absolutely.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.100
I'll get some of those going.

42:51.400 --> 42:54.200
Bringing the dogs
back to Calico Bluff

42:54.233 --> 42:57.767
a really good feeling
for both Kate and I.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.300
-Here we go, dinner music.

43:02.300 --> 43:04.500

with a cold beer

43:04.533 --> 43:06.967

in the dog lot again.
