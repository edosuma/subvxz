MAN:
On your knees.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.760
On your knees,
hands behind your head, now!

00:26.794 --> 00:28.496
Okay.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.401
(grunts)

00:38.606 --> 00:40.574
(sighs)

00:40.608 --> 00:42.476
It's not working.
RUSSELL:
It's working.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.746
Your circadian rhythm is off,
that's all.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.349
The human sleep cycle was
originally based on the sun.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.818
Technology changed
all that, so...

00:50.851 --> 00:52.520
take a deep breath.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.656
You are resetting
your internal clock.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.258
Ugh.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.162
I don't want to reset
my circadian rhythm,

01:01.195 --> 01:02.296
I just want
to sleep.

01:02.330 --> 01:05.599
I've been awake
for 33 hours straight.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.668
I knew you were
gonna resist this.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.170
That's why I brought
my secret weapon, here.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.539
What is that?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.674
It's, uh, red reishi tea.
It's a...

01:13.707 --> 01:15.676
it's a natural sedative.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.879
It's made from the legendary
red reishi mushroom

01:18.912 --> 01:20.414
out of east Asia.
Is this legal?

01:20.448 --> 01:22.116
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Yeah. Most states.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.584
Relax, will you?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.519
It's purely medicinal.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.620
Phew! Whew!

01:26.654 --> 01:28.789
Smells like goat urine.
I'm supposed to drink this?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.858
Yeah. Yeah, now,
the secret's in the brewing,

01:30.891 --> 01:33.627
so let it sit
for at least an hour, okay?

01:33.661 --> 01:35.329
Then a little cinnamon--
you'll be in heaven.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.598
Only 'cause I trust you.
Sucker.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.267
(both laugh)

01:39.300 --> 01:41.335
Avery, D.B.?
You need to see this.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.803
Social media is
out of control,

01:42.836 --> 01:44.205
all stemming
from a video

01:44.238 --> 01:45.673
from Ashdale,
Pennsylvania,

01:45.706 --> 01:46.540
that's going viral.

Okay!

RAVEN:
Ashdale PD claims
what we're watching

02:00.288 --> 02:02.356
is a fabrication.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.392
(two gunshots)

02:04.425 --> 02:06.427
RAVEN:
It's trending on Twitter,

02:09.863 --> 02:12.633
But the kicker is,
it's only been active 12 hours.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.935
Raven, bring up
the lower left screen, please.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.472
Tensions are high
in this small community...

02:18.506 --> 02:19.840
Agent Ryan.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.742
Well, who could've erased

02:21.775 --> 02:23.611
the Ashdale police
video system?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.346
...we have received
more information

02:25.379 --> 02:26.680
on the alleged victim.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.416
His name is Derek Noels.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.917
REPORTER:
The 31-year-old
unemployed factory worker...

02:29.950 --> 02:31.252
FEMALE REPORTER:
...while community
leaders gather,

02:31.285 --> 02:32.420
and even though authorities

02:32.453 --> 02:33.554
have yet to name
the officer involved,

02:33.587 --> 02:37.291
there's one question the world
clearly wants answered:

02:37.325 --> 02:39.860
Where is the body
of Derek Noels?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.962
Yes.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.631
Sounds to me like there
was a cyber security...

02:43.664 --> 02:45.333
NELSON:
What's going on?

02:45.366 --> 02:46.900
RYAN:
I understand that the police
video system was wiped.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.336
All right, heads up.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.671
The Department of Justice
has asked Cyber

02:50.704 --> 02:53.507
to investigate
a possible intrusion

02:53.541 --> 02:54.575
to the Ashdale police
department's video system.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.743
RUSSELL:
Ashdale PD is claiming

02:55.776 --> 02:57.545
that an unauthorized user

02:57.578 --> 02:58.646
hacked their system,

02:58.679 --> 02:59.513
and stole the video

02:59.547 --> 03:00.948
and then destroyed
the backup files.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.716
MUNDO:
These body cams
are being used

03:02.750 --> 03:04.318
by cops all across the country

03:04.352 --> 03:05.786
to the tune of $263 million

03:05.819 --> 03:07.421
in federal funding.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.556
If there's
a vulnerability,

03:08.589 --> 03:09.690
DOJ should
know about it.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.958
Not to mention a man was shot.

03:10.991 --> 03:11.959
Twice.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.861
The video itself
looks authentic.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.664
It definitely came from the
Ashdale police video system.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.831
Who has admin access

03:17.865 --> 03:18.666
to delete those files?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.801
The Chief of Police,
Allen Richards.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.237
He's the only person with
authority to delete video.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.372
All right,
that's where we start, then.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.539
Guys, look at this.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.007
Social media is
off the charts.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.542
Hashtag
"WhereIsDerekNoels?"

03:28.576 --> 03:30.411
has 10 million

03:30.444 --> 03:31.745
I've never seen
this kind of activity.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.880
People are angry.

03:32.913 --> 03:33.847
They want answers.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.817
They want what
they always want-- justice.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.853
RYAN:
Raven, you're here monitoring

03:39.887 --> 03:41.389
every second of this.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.456
Everyone else,
wheels up in ten.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.791
Whoever hacked that footage

03:43.824 --> 03:45.726
turned this city
into a racial time bomb.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.828
We have to stop him
before it goes off.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.701
(shouting)

03:53.734 --> 03:55.369

Justice knows no death!

03:55.403 --> 03:56.904
Where is Derek Noels?

03:56.937 --> 03:58.806
Justice knows no death!

03:58.839 --> 04:01.542
Where is Derek Noels?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.010
Justice knows no death!

04:03.043 --> 04:05.913
I will say this,
the video tells one story,

04:05.946 --> 04:07.781
the officer involved
tells another,

04:07.815 --> 04:09.683
and they both can't
be telling the truth.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.320
We can't help unless
we have full access

04:12.353 --> 04:13.687
to all the information.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.456
I've answered every
question I can,

04:15.489 --> 04:17.325
handed over every camera
and computer that we've got...

04:17.358 --> 04:19.026
I need to speak
with the officer involved.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.394
I want a name.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.695
That's not gonna happen,
Agent Ryan.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.364
Department policy.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.700
We don't release
any information, to anyone,

04:26.734 --> 04:28.001
until we complete
our internal review.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.570
Uh, Chief Richards, look,

04:29.603 --> 04:31.872
we-we all want the same
thing here, the truth.

04:31.905 --> 04:32.873
Do we?

04:32.906 --> 04:35.876
Without question.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.878
Look, you've seen
the crowd.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.079
You can understand

04:39.112 --> 04:41.449
the time-sensitive
nature of our request.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.050
All due respect,
Mr. Russell,

04:43.083 --> 04:44.652
30 years on the force,

04:44.685 --> 04:46.720
not one protest.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.422
Now we're one stray brick

04:48.456 --> 04:50.524
from being synonymous
with Michael Brown and Ferguson

04:50.558 --> 04:51.892
or Freddie Gray and Baltimore.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.362
So, yes, I understand
the nature of your request.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.899
An internal review
could take weeks.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.934
Looks like we're in
for a hell of a fight.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.803
Looks like.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.938
But since we're already
into a fight...

05:04.972 --> 05:07.508
might as well
throw the first punch.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.609
Yeah, Raven.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.478
Time to find out who
the officer is in that video.

05:10.511 --> 05:14.482
CROWD (chanting):
Justice knows no death!

05:14.515 --> 05:18.752
...and this was Derek
in high school.

05:18.786 --> 05:19.953
He played drums in the band.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.855
He wanted to be
on the football team, but...

05:24.825 --> 05:27.127
When's the last time
you saw Derek?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.497
Oh, it's been
several months.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.899
He would come and go.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.100
He couldn't find work...

05:33.133 --> 05:35.035
it-it was hard.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.004
And then my
birthday came,

05:37.037 --> 05:39.607
and he never missed my birthday.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.008
That's when I knew
something was wrong.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.444
And you filed
a missing persons report.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.880
Ms. Noels,

05:46.914 --> 05:47.948
I'm aware that Derek had

05:47.981 --> 05:51.018
a couple of previous arrests
for drug possession.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.787
Do you know if
he was still in that world?

05:53.821 --> 05:55.088
You mean, was he a drug dealer?

05:55.122 --> 05:56.790
Yes.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.926
He used more than he sold.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.130
He was no angel, Agent Ryan,

06:03.163 --> 06:04.698
but no one deserves this.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.603
That's a beautiful necklace.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.005
It's a gift from Derek.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.007
He always said

06:14.041 --> 06:15.943
he would give me the world.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.412
(sobbing):
No matter how
hard I tried,

06:18.446 --> 06:20.748
I couldn't save my baby.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.788
I just couldn't
save my baby.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.626
(indistinct chatter)

06:35.028 --> 06:37.064
NELSON:
Ah! Found it--

06:37.097 --> 06:39.733
a root kit hooked
to the system's kernel API.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.868
That confirms it.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.470
Chief Richards
is not our hacker.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.971
Someone owned
this machine.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.842
NELSON:
They watched, they waited,

06:48.876 --> 06:50.944
then logged in
as Chief Richards...

06:52.813 --> 06:54.114
...and copied the video
and wiped the backups

06:54.147 --> 06:55.516
without anyone even knowing.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.521
All we have to do is figure out
who put it there and why.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.589
Krummy?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.056
KRUMITZ:
Man, look at 'em.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.925
Staring at you.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.226
'Cause you're black, they think
you're out to get 'em.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.830
No, they think
we're out to get them.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.131
We're FBI.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.534
And right now, we're the enemy.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.068
Right.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.539
Hey, between you and me,
I understand discrimination.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.842
I often get profiled
for, you know,

07:21.875 --> 07:23.143
being big-boned.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.879
Krummy, you did not just equate

07:25.913 --> 07:27.180
being big-boned
with being black?

07:27.214 --> 07:28.882
The bigger the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.884
(laughs)

07:30.918 --> 07:32.886
You know, I can't talk
to you anymore, man.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.588
It's true.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.156
It's really "the blacker the
berry, the sweeter the juice."

07:36.189 --> 07:38.458
Pfft. Depends on
who you ask.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.597

07:46.233 --> 07:48.536
I've got the cop camera
footage that you sent

07:48.569 --> 07:50.003

the Ashdale Police Department.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.172
That's 89 officers.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.741
And the comparison video?

07:53.774 --> 07:55.876
The cleanest copy of
the Derek Noels shooting footage

07:55.909 --> 07:57.044
I could find online.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.012
Okay.

Uh, just one question...

08:02.683 --> 08:03.884
I know the players,

08:03.917 --> 08:05.719
but what's the game?

08:05.753 --> 08:08.622
It's called
"find the faceless cop."

08:08.656 --> 08:11.124
See, all these officers
think they're anonymous

08:11.158 --> 08:13.861
when they wear a body-cam,
but they're not.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.964
Height, weight,
musculature, past injuries

08:16.997 --> 08:19.266
broken bones...
all determine how they run.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.970
That translates
into biometric markers

08:23.003 --> 08:26.006
that give the recorded video
a unique shake pattern.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.009
It's like the video equivalent
of a fingerprint.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.746
RAVEN:
So if the cop
who shot Derek Noels

08:32.780 --> 08:34.081
is Ashdale PD, we've got him.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.716
Ain't science great?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.918
*

08:52.933 --> 08:55.068
D.B., it worked.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.705
The faceless cop now has a face.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.006
And a name:

08:59.039 --> 09:01.809
Officer Dean Causley.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.177
RYAN:
Officer Causley,
it says here

09:04.211 --> 09:06.980
you have three open
IA investigations:

09:07.014 --> 09:08.115
two for excessive force

09:08.148 --> 09:09.783
and one for shaking down

09:09.817 --> 09:11.251
a local drug dealer.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.986
All the suspects involved
were black, is that correct?

09:13.020 --> 09:13.887
Sorry. I have advised my client

09:13.921 --> 09:16.624
not to answer
that question at this time.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.758
Okay.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.760
Officer Causley,

09:19.793 --> 09:21.094
did you know Derek Noels?

09:21.128 --> 09:23.030
Again, I've advised
my client

09:23.063 --> 09:24.765
not to answer that question

09:24.798 --> 09:26.700
at this time.
Okay, here's an easy one.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.969
How did you dispose
of Derek Noels' remains?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.604
Come on,
Agent Ryan.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.172
Tread lightly.
We're doing you a favor.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.207
There's no proof Officer
Causley's even on that video.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.844
That's where you're wrong.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.880
RYAN:
This is a side-by-side
comparison.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.816
This is your police body cam
video from a few weeks ago,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.618
this is Derek Noels' video.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.086
Your biometric markers are

09:46.119 --> 09:47.320
a 91% match to
the shooting video.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.657
It's junk science.
It proves nothing.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.224
Just because you
don't understand it

09:51.258 --> 09:52.993
doesn't mean
it's junk.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.962
It proves that
your client's a liar--

09:54.995 --> 09:56.830
more than likely, a murderer.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.131
Watch your mouth.
NELSON:
Or what?

09:58.165 --> 09:59.833
You gonna
put a bullet in my back?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.034
Nelson. Wait.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.204
Officer Causley,

10:04.237 --> 10:06.807
I'm going to make you

10:06.840 --> 10:08.275
a one-time offer.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.745
You take me
to Derek's remains

10:11.779 --> 10:14.181
and I will make sure the death
penalty is off the table.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.182
All right, that's it.
We're done. We're done here.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.684
It was me.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.751
I'm the cop in the video.

10:17.785 --> 10:18.719
Dean, don't say anything else.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.153
Dammit, Stan, shut up!

10:20.187 --> 10:21.755
(sighs) Look.

10:21.789 --> 10:22.823
I roughed the guy up, all right?

10:22.856 --> 10:24.124
I took his stash.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.258
It happens all the time.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.660
No harm, no foul,
no report.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.996
But what you saw
in that video,

10:29.029 --> 10:31.965
that never happened.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.801
Nobody died in that alley.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.836
Nobody.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.875
(sighs) Torrential rain,
passage of time.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.443
There's no way any
trace evidence survived.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.147
Yeah, we're not looking
for physical evidence.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.850
What are we looking for?

10:49.883 --> 10:53.754
We are looking
for George Mallory's camera.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.024
I'm sorry.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.258
I-I do this sometimes.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.260
Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953

11:00.293 --> 11:02.395
became the first man
to conquer Mount Everest,

11:02.429 --> 11:05.833
but in fact, the honor
of being first to the summit

11:05.866 --> 11:08.902
was claimed 29 years earlier

11:08.936 --> 11:11.138
by-by George Mallory.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.472
D.B., what does George Mallory
have to do

11:12.505 --> 11:14.274
with what happened here?

11:14.307 --> 11:15.976
Well, it's a,
it's a lesson in proof.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.410
See, Mallory fell
down the mountain and died,

11:17.444 --> 11:18.712
lost his camera,

11:18.746 --> 11:20.147
The film in the camera

11:20.180 --> 11:23.984
would've been proof that-that
Mallory had been first.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.485
This camera should give us

11:25.518 --> 11:27.988
the same point of view
as the police body cam footage.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.156
What do you think?

11:29.189 --> 11:32.459
That's exactly where Causley
and Noels were that night.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.194
So, yeah.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.195
Good, yeah.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.430
Now do-do your, uh, yeah.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.966
Okay.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.267
Ready?
Ready.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.302
Fall down.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.873
Bam, bam.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.207
Oh, Elijah,

11:47.240 --> 11:48.976
look at that.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.244
Right? Now watch.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.314
Bam,

11:54.347 --> 11:56.149
bam.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.221
The light off your mag reflected
off the hubcap,

12:01.254 --> 12:03.190
but in the video,
there's no reflection,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.291
which means there was
no muzzle flash.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.358
No muzzle flash,

12:05.392 --> 12:07.227
no gunshot.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.496
This is proof that Derek Noels
was not shot in this alley.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.964
This video was tampered with.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.099
Yeah.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.333
The gunshots were faked.

12:17.570 --> 12:23.911
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

12:25.813 --> 12:32.185
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

12:32.219 --> 12:35.322
* I can see
for miles and miles *

12:35.355 --> 12:39.359
* I can see for miles
and miles *

12:39.392 --> 12:43.430
* I can see
for miles and miles *

12:43.463 --> 12:47.400
* And miles...

12:47.434 --> 12:48.435
* Oh, yeah.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.986
The fact that those gunshots
were faked

13:06.019 --> 13:07.420
doesn't make Causley innocent.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.122
No, but somebody went to
a lot of trouble

13:09.156 --> 13:10.123
to make him look guilty.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.860
Well, we know Causley
wouldn't upload a video

13:12.893 --> 13:14.094
of himself killing someone.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.062
Yeah, which means we are dealing

13:15.095 --> 13:16.029
with a very talented black hat.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.498
REPORTER: About a dozen
downtown businesses

13:18.531 --> 13:21.234
were boarded up Wednesday
and glass littered the sidewalks

13:21.268 --> 13:23.937
following two nights of protests
over the police shooting

13:23.971 --> 13:25.605
of an unarmed black man.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.440
There were few people
in the streets

13:27.474 --> 13:30.277
as police urged
curiosity-seekers

13:30.310 --> 13:32.245
to stay out of the
Over the Rhine neighborhood.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.281
Technology stocks...

13:55.903 --> 13:57.204
Krumitz, check the
BlackPowerForever

13:57.237 --> 13:58.538
social media feed.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.476
Oh, man.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.248
Agent Ryan.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.217
Avery, are you still
at Officer Causley's house?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.886
Nelson and I are finishing
collecting evidence, why?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.287
Get out. Causley was DOX'd.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.288
His name, photo,

14:15.322 --> 14:16.924
and address were leaked online.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.458
CROWD (chanting):
Where is Derek Noels?

14:18.491 --> 14:21.294
Justice knows no death!

14:21.328 --> 14:22.462
Krumitz, call dispatch.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.064
Have them send APD units
out fast.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.198
Okay, pack up. We're leaving.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.934
His personal information
was made public.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.101
What are you doing?

14:28.135 --> 14:28.969
This is my home.

14:29.002 --> 14:32.005
Okay, I'm not leaving
without a fight.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.141
The last thing you
or this situation needs

14:34.174 --> 14:35.242
is that gun in your hand.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.110
Give it to me!

14:37.144 --> 14:39.279
(sighs)

14:44.017 --> 14:46.353
Elijah, APD's been dispatched
to Causley's house,

14:46.386 --> 14:47.988
but they're not gonna make it
in time.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.158
Connect me to Avery.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.127
Get down! Elijah!

14:54.161 --> 14:55.929
You're never gonna get out the
front door, not with this mob.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.664
Change of plans,
we're going out the side door.

14:57.697 --> 14:58.498
Go, go, go, go, go!

14:58.531 --> 15:01.034
(chanting):
Where is Derek Noels?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.036
Where is Derek Noels?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.204
Justice knows no death!

15:06.239 --> 15:07.507
Get in the back.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.675
Go, go, go.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.177
MUNDO:
Everybody, FBI, back off!

15:10.210 --> 15:11.344
Stay back!

15:11.378 --> 15:13.513
Hey, back off! Back off now!

15:13.546 --> 15:15.215
Everybody, back up.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.253
Everyone, back off!

15:20.287 --> 15:22.122
Back off! Back off!

15:22.155 --> 15:23.090
We're in! Fall back!

15:23.123 --> 15:24.424
Stay right where you are.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.525
We demand justice!

15:27.527 --> 15:28.561
AVERY:
Heads down!

15:28.595 --> 15:30.497
(tires squealing)

15:36.703 --> 15:39.139
Well, Causley is officially

15:39.172 --> 15:41.174
in protective custody.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.043
He's done talking.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.477
This guy has
multiple accusations

15:44.511 --> 15:47.247
of excessive force and bribery
on his jacket.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.583
The last time Derek Noels
was seen alive was on his watch,

15:50.617 --> 15:52.152
andneeds protection?

15:52.185 --> 15:53.753
Sometimes I hate this job.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.455
Okay, all right, all right.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.390
so the site,
BlackPowerForever,

15:57.424 --> 15:58.625
claims that they were hacked,

15:58.658 --> 16:00.227
that they didn't
DOX Causley, right?

16:00.260 --> 16:03.330
So the million dollar question
is if they didn't,

16:03.363 --> 16:05.065
who did?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.399
With what we know now,

16:06.433 --> 16:09.702
he's profiling as a white male
in his 30s,

16:09.736 --> 16:12.172
well-educated
with a high risk tolerance,

16:12.205 --> 16:14.274
and he is dangerously patient.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.342
That's interesting.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.643
You think our target is white.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.545
Wouldn't a black target

16:18.578 --> 16:22.349
have more incentive to expose
this kind of evil?

16:22.382 --> 16:24.184
Yeah, but if he was black,

16:24.217 --> 16:27.354
he would feel a sense of pride.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.357
And I believe he would find a
way to take credit for righting

16:30.390 --> 16:33.060
this profound injustice.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.395
But this guy,
he hasn't taken any credit.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.031
He hasn't made any demands.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.699
He hasn't issued
any statements.

16:39.732 --> 16:43.570
He's just sitting back,
watching this all happen.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.772
Okay, so it's not about a cause
or even justice.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.374
What does he want?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.741
Chaos.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.211
But it isn't random.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.247
It is controlled, specific.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.382
It's personal to him.

16:55.415 --> 16:58.551
He wants to light a match
and watch this town burn.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.220
And like Nero,

17:00.253 --> 17:03.690
play his lire
while Rome goes up in flames.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.492
(chuckles)

17:05.525 --> 17:08.461
And like Nero,

17:08.495 --> 17:10.630
he'll be close enough
to feel the fire.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.032
And that's how we'll get him.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.378
(chanting):
Where is Derek Noels?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.147
REPORTER:
Chief Richards.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.549
Chief Richards, any
reaction to the reports

17:29.582 --> 17:31.218
that the Derek Noels shooting
video was tampered with?

17:31.251 --> 17:34.187
Julie, you know I can't comment
on an ongoing investigation.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.455
Can you at least confirm
that the cop involved

17:35.488 --> 17:36.489
was Officer Dean Causley?

17:39.326 --> 17:40.660
(sighs)
There you have it.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.430
Questions continue to
go unanswered as unrest grows,

17:43.463 --> 17:45.332
evidenced
by this shocking video

17:45.365 --> 17:47.500
film by a protester that
has many asking the question
(clapping)

17:47.534 --> 17:48.868
whether or not the FBI...
There he is. Welcome back.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.438
Hey, great job, man.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.373
Glad to have you here.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.278
I don't get it.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.812
I have checked everything,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.248
and I have no idea how

18:01.281 --> 18:02.182
Chief Richards' computer
got infected.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.351
Did you scan
the local machine registry?

18:04.384 --> 18:07.354
KRUMITZ:
Twice.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.756
All right, did you check the TCP
and UDP port traffic?

18:09.789 --> 18:11.858
KRUMITZ:
Backwards and forwards.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.460
All right, look,
don't worry, Krummy.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.894
You'll figure it out.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.396
A big-boned friend once said

18:16.429 --> 18:17.864
that if necessity
is the mother of invention,

18:17.897 --> 18:20.233
then perseverance
is definitely the father.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.369
(chuckles)

18:22.402 --> 18:23.570
Thanks, Nelson.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.305
I love it when you call me
Big Poppa.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.440
Oh, that was a good one.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.408
That was, wasn't it?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.610
Hey, never saw it coming.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.281
Never saw it coming.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.783
Son of backdoor hack.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.286
He hid it.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.220
He hid it.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.388
Okay, um, I'll let you know
what I find.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.191
REPORTER: Ashdale residents
gather around City Hall...

18:44.224 --> 18:46.259
REPORTER 2:
A country remains divided,

18:46.293 --> 18:48.461
a city simmers
in the threat of violence.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.662
(protesters chanting,
sirens wailing)

18:59.272 --> 19:01.674
A city simmers
in the threat of violence,

19:01.708 --> 19:04.311
and a mother longs
to bury her son.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.712
* A new day

19:05.745 --> 19:08.515
...held in honor of Derek Noels,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.717
will start to heal them all.
* Let's fly away

19:10.750 --> 19:13.920
* And see the world as one

19:13.953 --> 19:17.224
* Let us believe today

19:17.257 --> 19:19.492
* You'll rise and say

19:19.526 --> 19:24.231
* A new day

19:24.264 --> 19:26.266
* Has begun.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.439
Hey, you're back.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.706
I solved the riddle.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.475
I know how the hacker
got into the system.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.510
Fantastic. How?

19:37.544 --> 19:39.379
Were you at
the March on Washington?

19:39.412 --> 19:40.913
Yeah.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.349
Yeah, I was.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.850
My parents felt
that it was a moment

19:43.883 --> 19:45.985
that we should share
as a family.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.887
I'm embarrassed to say

19:47.920 --> 19:51.491
that all I can remember is
it was really hot.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.892
Hmm, one of the seminal moments
of equality

19:52.925 --> 19:54.594
in our nation's history,

19:54.627 --> 19:55.895
and you were there.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.464
Yes, I was.
Wow.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.431
Huh.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.666
Daniel?
Yeah?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.000
The riddle?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.302
Oh, right, right.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.303
Our target.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.472
He infected the camera's
charger with malware,

20:05.505 --> 20:07.974
and then snuck it
into the precinct.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.444
Once he found out what type
of body cams

20:11.478 --> 20:12.379
they used,
he copied the packaging,

20:12.412 --> 20:14.914
disguised himself
as a delivery man,

20:14.947 --> 20:16.616
and dropped off
the infected hardware.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.451
He was in and out
in under a minute.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.521
Then, when it was plugged in,
it began crawling

20:21.554 --> 20:23.290
through the network until it
found the chief's computer

20:23.323 --> 20:24.524
and took over.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.758
See, that's why we didn't
see any evidence

20:25.792 --> 20:26.993
of suspicious devices.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.561
He used one that belonged.

20:28.595 --> 20:29.962
So it wasn't tampered with?

20:29.996 --> 20:31.864
Not physically,
but inside,

20:31.898 --> 20:33.633
it's crawling
with compromise.

20:33.666 --> 20:37.537
Don't plug your charger in
unless you know where it's been.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.539
I made that up. (chuckles)

20:39.572 --> 20:40.440
Genius.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.941
Well... (chuckles)

20:41.974 --> 20:43.710
I wouldn't say genius.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.512
Uh, sneaky, maybe,

20:45.545 --> 20:47.547
but not-not-not genius.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.482
Anyway, I sandboxed
the malware

20:49.516 --> 20:51.284
and got the IP address
that's phoning home

20:51.318 --> 20:52.385
to a Southside
community center

20:52.419 --> 20:53.653
in Ashdale.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.556
Avery, Elijah and a tactical
team are en route.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.561
(indistinct radio transmissions)

21:01.594 --> 21:02.995
(shutter clicking)

21:06.533 --> 21:08.868
DISPATCHER:
Agent Thompson, Agent Thompson,

21:08.901 --> 21:10.470
uh, West Commander, uh, Marks

21:10.503 --> 21:12.439
will be looking
for you on scene...

21:12.472 --> 21:15.508
WOMAN:
This is our church!

21:15.542 --> 21:17.610
Who would do something
like this? Why?

21:17.644 --> 21:20.580
(indistinct radio transmission)

21:20.613 --> 21:22.582
Thankfully, no one was injured.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.584
But everything
worth anything was torched.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.721
I doubt those devices
are gonna yield much.

21:28.755 --> 21:32.091
That was his intent--
to destroy all the evidence.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.694
Fist he made sure
the church was clear.

21:34.727 --> 21:38.431
Then he doused the whole place
with exhilarant.

21:38.465 --> 21:41.468
He rigged the
electrical wiring.

21:41.501 --> 21:42.735
So whoever flipped that switch,

21:42.769 --> 21:45.472
would burn this place
to the ground.

21:47.574 --> 21:51.344
(indistinct radio transmission)

21:52.612 --> 21:55.081
You all right?
Yeah.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.316
I'm all right.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.046
(camera clicking)

22:27.079 --> 22:29.549
I've never seen
anything like it.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.750
It's a Proxy Ham.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.018
Found it at the fire.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.119
Heard rumors about them,

22:33.152 --> 22:35.087
but never seen one in action.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.490
So our target
used this to make us

22:37.524 --> 22:38.758
think that
the Southside Community Center

22:38.791 --> 22:40.927
is where the video
was sent and downloaded.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.529
Exactly.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.696
The fire destroys the evidence

22:43.730 --> 22:44.897
and the trail goes cold.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.566
But if I can pinpoint
the exact frequency,

22:46.599 --> 22:47.600
I can track it.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.704
Nelson?

22:51.738 --> 22:53.840
Are you okay?

22:55.642 --> 22:58.411
Everyone's
favorite question lately.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.647
Difference is I know
when you're lying.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.783
No.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.652
I'm not okay.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.620
If I get mad,
I'm the angry black man.

23:07.654 --> 23:10.657
If I say nothing,
I'm an Uncle Tom.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.191
I just want to do my job.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.461
And come home.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.195
I'm sorry.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.164
I know words don't always help,

23:18.197 --> 23:20.099
but you should know...

23:20.132 --> 23:22.935
sometimes it's okay to be angry.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.539
Bye.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.608
RYAN:
Brody Nelson?

23:28.641 --> 23:31.043
Please tell me you
have a lead.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.211
I'll do better than that.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.713
It's a homemade relay device

23:33.746 --> 23:35.648
that redirected
the community center's Wi-Fi

23:35.682 --> 23:36.983
over a radio frequency.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.217
Tricking us into thinking

23:38.250 --> 23:40.453
that the cyber trail
died in the fire.

23:40.487 --> 23:41.688
(chuckles)
That smile tells me

23:41.721 --> 23:42.922
it didn't work.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.724
Yeah, that's because
our target is smart.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.226
Think of him like a bank robber,
who robs a bank,

23:47.259 --> 23:48.661
then escapes in a getaway car.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.162
Heads into the tunnel,
cops follow,

23:50.196 --> 23:51.698
cars crash-- boom!

23:51.731 --> 23:53.900
Tunnel explodes.
Everyone thinks it's over.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.603
But the target used a secret
underground passageway

23:56.636 --> 23:57.770
to give the police the slip,

23:57.804 --> 23:59.572
escaped unharmed.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.240
Boys in blue never knew.

24:01.273 --> 24:05.144
Our hacker redirected
the video using radio waves

24:05.177 --> 24:08.080
knowing that the cops would
never even think to look.

24:08.114 --> 24:11.083
We're not the cops.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.953
We're Cyber.
Oh!

24:13.986 --> 24:15.888
All we have to do
is follow this frequency.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.890
Krummy will track him down.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.871
Marco.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.543
Marco.

24:38.745 --> 24:41.180
Marco.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.119
Polo.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.560
MAN:
Clear!

24:53.593 --> 24:54.594
(Krumitz whoops)

24:54.627 --> 24:56.195
This is definitely
the right place.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.697
All clear!

24:57.730 --> 24:59.699
KRUMITZ:
Robert Gaines,

24:59.732 --> 25:00.800
Professor of Sociology.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.802
Clear!

25:02.835 --> 25:05.938
Where the hell are you,
Mr. Gaines?

25:05.972 --> 25:09.909
Dean, there's a guy
here to see you.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.310
Said he's got
the information you wanted.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.912
Says he's a friend.

25:12.945 --> 25:13.780
Who is it?

25:13.813 --> 25:14.947
Won't say.

25:14.981 --> 25:16.115
But he said
that Nicole sent him.

25:26.292 --> 25:27.794
(chuckles)

25:27.827 --> 25:29.061
Yeah, send him in.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.568
Well, that's interesting.

25:35.602 --> 25:37.604
What is?

25:39.639 --> 25:41.841
You see that-- USB drive
sitting right there?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.810
I bet you cash money
that's a kill drive,

25:43.843 --> 25:46.278
designed to wipe the entire
hard drive if it's removed.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.814
So, what's the play?

25:47.847 --> 25:49.048
Uh, don't remove it.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.850
Just shut the whole system down.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.819
Oh, damn it!

25:52.852 --> 25:54.086
What? What happened?

25:54.120 --> 25:55.121
It was set to wipe
no matter what.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.756
We're losing everything.

25:56.789 --> 25:57.690
Can you image it?

25:57.724 --> 25:58.691
I'll let you know

25:58.725 --> 25:59.692
in about ten seconds.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.994
What are you doing here, Bobby?

26:02.028 --> 26:04.831
I wanted to see you.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.766
Figured five years
was long enough.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.735
You're a bad liar.

26:08.768 --> 26:09.769
I was hoping

26:09.802 --> 26:10.837
with all that's going on,

26:10.870 --> 26:12.972
you were ready to make amends.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.340
Amends for what?

26:14.373 --> 26:15.675
Doing what's right?

26:15.708 --> 26:16.843
You hurt me, Dean.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.011
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

26:19.045 --> 26:20.913
Isn't that worth an apology?

26:22.882 --> 26:24.651
You're right.

26:24.684 --> 26:25.952
I'm sorry.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.756
I'm sorry you're a fool
and she's a whore.

26:29.789 --> 26:32.625
Why, you ungrateful bastard!

26:32.659 --> 26:33.826
Get off me!

26:33.860 --> 26:34.894
(both grunting)

26:34.927 --> 26:36.228
Get him off!

26:36.262 --> 26:38.064
Get off!

26:38.097 --> 26:40.166
You're gonna pay for this, Dean!

26:40.199 --> 26:42.301
I swear to God,
you're gonna pay!

26:42.334 --> 26:44.771
MAN:
Stop it!

26:44.804 --> 26:46.038
RUSSELL:
What's the verdict?

26:46.072 --> 26:47.740
Um, didn't get much.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.843
You should have it
on screen now.

26:50.877 --> 26:51.911
A few files, some photos,

26:51.944 --> 26:53.913
his doctoral thesis.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.022
The plot thickens.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.256
What? What is it?

27:04.290 --> 27:05.892
Avery was right.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.760
This is personal.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.762
Officer Causley
and Robert Gaines

27:09.796 --> 27:10.797
are brothers.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.307
(indistinct chatter)

27:21.340 --> 27:22.875
So, all of us blue-eyed kids

27:22.909 --> 27:24.844
were seated
at the back of the class.

27:24.877 --> 27:27.079
We were denied privileges,

27:27.113 --> 27:28.681
told that we were stupid,

27:28.715 --> 27:30.416
treated like
second-class citizens.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.284
And all the brown-eyed kids

27:32.318 --> 27:35.221
were treated like
little geniuses, little gods.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.223
The next day the teacher
reversed the roles,

27:37.256 --> 27:39.391
and we were sat up front.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.694
And we were given
all the privileges.

27:41.728 --> 27:43.029
And the brown-eyed kids,

27:43.062 --> 27:45.164
they were treated like
less than.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.033
And they were discriminated
against by all of us.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.035
That's fascinating.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.737
It was called "The Blue Eyes,
Brown Eyes" experiment.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.139
Separating third graders
by eye color

27:53.172 --> 27:56.075
to teach them
the tenets of racism.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.309
I mean, that's brilliant.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.179
And extremely controversial.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.714
But it was powerful.

28:01.748 --> 28:02.882
It changed me.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.416
Okay, so you're thinking that

28:04.450 --> 28:05.852
Gaines is conducting

28:05.885 --> 28:08.254
a racially based
social experiment.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.155
Is that right?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.389
It's the only theory
that makes sense.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.824
Gaines won critical acclaim

28:11.858 --> 28:12.959
for a book he wrote--

28:12.992 --> 28:14.326
From Negro to Black:

28:14.360 --> 28:17.196
The Forced Assimilation
of the African American.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.331
So, it's unlikely
that Gaines is a racist.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.433
His arguments are well reasoned.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.902
He claims that
knowing the signs

28:22.935 --> 28:25.304
of racial discord
will help defeat it. Here.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.174
In his thesis,
Gaines hypothesizes that:

28:28.207 --> 28:30.176
"Any city with a black populace

28:30.209 --> 28:32.111
of 20% to 50%

28:32.144 --> 28:35.314
and an unemployment of 16% or
higher is a racial tinderbox."

28:35.347 --> 28:37.383
Well, Ashdale's a perfect fit.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.051
Just look around.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.487
Clearly racism is still
rearing its ugly head.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.889
But here's the weird thing--

28:42.922 --> 28:44.123
I don't think
this is about race.

28:44.156 --> 28:48.027
It's about him-- Gaines.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.230
He's socially engineering racism
to prove his doctoral thesis.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.866
Okay, well, if that's true,

28:53.900 --> 28:57.036
then he's been planning this
for a long time.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.204
He might even know something

28:58.237 --> 29:01.273
about Derek Noels that we don't.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.474
Might've even he killed him.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.110
It's possible.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.311
Gaines knows this city.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.314
And he knows the people of
Ashdale cannot take another hit.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.382
Which means that's
exactly what's gonna happen.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.819
Okay, so what's he planning?

29:12.852 --> 29:14.921
I don't know what,
but I know where.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.522
Every news outlet
in the country is gonna be

29:16.555 --> 29:18.290
at Derek Noels' vigil tonight.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.459
That's where he'll strike.
So he's ours.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.328
We know who he is
and where he'll be.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.330
All we need is enough eyes
to find him.

29:24.363 --> 29:27.466
(crowd chanting)

29:27.499 --> 29:30.102
As emotions run high,
people are now calling

29:30.136 --> 29:31.503
for an investigation
into this incident.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.540
Asking if the FBI went too far

29:34.573 --> 29:38.044
in striking a defenseless
black protester.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.111
Hey, Avery thinks Gaines
is gonna be at the vigil.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.113
We're setting up surveillance
to take him down.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.781
Thanks.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.185
Do we have a problem?

29:46.218 --> 29:47.219
Nah.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.821
No problem.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.593
When two men have a problem,
they talk about it.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.096
More often than not,
that problem goes away.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.965
That would be a great approach
if we had a problem.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.400
If this is about that takedown,

30:01.433 --> 30:04.036
it was a clean takedown.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.304
It had nothing to do with race.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.306
And there we go.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.141
Every time someone says
it's not about race,

30:09.175 --> 30:10.943
the one thing
you can take to the bank

30:10.977 --> 30:12.879
is that it's definitely
about race.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.981
Well, not this time, Nelson.
Come on, you were there.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.049
You saw it-- a guy came
at my head with a baseball bat.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.885
It's not about that!

30:21.020 --> 30:23.923
Look!

30:23.956 --> 30:26.492
E-mails I accessed
while looking for the intrusion.

30:26.525 --> 30:27.559
You see?

30:31.230 --> 30:33.065
Oh, there's more.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.138
This is my favorite one
right here.

30:43.109 --> 30:46.178
Those words didn't come
from the racists out there.

30:46.212 --> 30:49.015
Those are words from them!

30:49.048 --> 30:50.649
Yeah, some of the very
cops you cozied up to

30:50.682 --> 30:53.019
after your greatest hits
performance.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.991
Listen, you got to know
I would never stand for this.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.427
I'm not like that.

31:01.460 --> 31:02.962
And most of them
aren't, either.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.031
They're good people.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.099
It only takes a few.

31:07.133 --> 31:10.036
This doesn't
happen overnight.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.570
Robert Gaines
might have lit the match,

31:11.603 --> 31:15.007
but the gas
was poured years ago.

31:15.041 --> 31:18.110
Nelson... I'm sorry.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.312
I mean, you're right--
this is despicable.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.316
But you can't
make me accountable

31:24.350 --> 31:26.652
for some bigoted cops
that I don't even know.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.991
Look me in my eye, bro, and tell
me you never said it before.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.961
In anger, in jest,

31:34.994 --> 31:37.563
singing the words
to your favorite song,

31:37.596 --> 31:40.132
laughing at
an inappropriate joke,

31:40.166 --> 31:42.434
failing to correct
a friend or a family member

31:42.468 --> 31:46.105
when they crossed the line.

31:46.138 --> 31:49.008
Tell me you're the one.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.254
(water runs)

32:25.577 --> 32:27.980
(gasps)
(chuckles)

32:28.014 --> 32:29.481
(laughs)

32:31.250 --> 32:33.252
You scared me.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.158
Do you love me?

32:39.191 --> 32:40.659
Forever.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.633
Prove it.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.502
I thought I proved it
when I married you, but...

32:53.705 --> 32:56.242
...I'll happily do it again.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.147
KRUMITZ: All right,
Raven, ready when you are.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.082
RAMIREZ:
Give me a sec.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.283
I'm linking to
the security cam footage

33:04.316 --> 33:06.052
outside the Ashdale
police station.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.153
We'll be able to find
Gaines if he's there.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.460
All right, facial recognition
is up and running.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.428
We're also searching the crowd
for any signs of Gaines.

33:16.462 --> 33:19.631
But these are live feeds,
so there's a time delay.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.333
RYAN: Copy that.
MUNDO: All right,
you guys are our eyes.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.335
It's a mad house down here.

33:23.369 --> 33:27.373
(chanting):
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

33:27.406 --> 33:30.376
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

33:30.409 --> 33:33.812
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

33:33.845 --> 33:35.347
Okay, I think
we've got something.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.316
Elijah, 20 yards north,
across the street.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.517
Blue shirt, black hat.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.220
I got him.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.322
...justice knows no death.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.325
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

33:46.358 --> 33:49.495
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

33:49.528 --> 33:50.629
Where is Derek Noels?

33:50.662 --> 33:52.398
He made me. I lost him.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.266
RYAN:
Krummy, talk to me.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.334
Uh, okay, okay.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.635
Okay, okay, um...

33:56.668 --> 33:58.437
There he is, there he is,
to your left, Avery.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.471
He's right beside you.

34:00.572 --> 34:03.409
RAMIREZ:
Elijah, 3:00.

34:03.442 --> 34:04.510
...justice knows no death.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.544
Where is Derek Noels?

34:05.577 --> 34:06.745
Justice knows no death!

34:06.778 --> 34:08.414
Where is Derek Noels?

34:08.447 --> 34:09.748
RYAN: Hands up,
hands up, don't move.

34:09.781 --> 34:12.318
FBI, hands behind
your back now!

34:12.351 --> 34:13.552
Give me your
other hand!

34:13.585 --> 34:16.188
RYAN:
He wiped his phone.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.223
Stand back! Clear!

34:25.264 --> 34:27.433
(chanting):
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

34:30.536 --> 34:33.372
Mr. Gaines,
I'm Special Agent Avery Ryan.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.840
I'm with the FBI.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.342
May I please have some water?

34:36.375 --> 34:37.409
I have
a few questions.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.811
You answer them honestly,
you'll not only get water,

34:39.845 --> 34:41.813
I'll let you speak
to your wife, Nicole.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.215
How does that sound?

34:43.249 --> 34:44.683
You're good.

34:44.716 --> 34:48.587
I mean, you set the parameters
of what you want,

34:48.620 --> 34:51.457
use my wife as a lure
to ensure cooperation,

34:51.490 --> 34:53.892
even drop her first name to
put us on a personal level.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.561
It's impressive.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.429
Thanks.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.531
I read your thesis.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.899
I know it's a sick experiment,

35:00.932 --> 35:02.568
some twisted social game
you're playing,

35:02.601 --> 35:03.902
but why?

35:03.935 --> 35:05.571
This is no game, Agent Ryan.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.407
This is the evolution
of social science.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.178
I was able to predict
with absolute certainty

35:12.211 --> 35:14.680
the chain of events
which led to-to this moment.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.818
Mankind will benefit
because of us.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.288
And who is "us"?

35:22.321 --> 35:24.156
Derek and I.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.357
Derek Noels?

35:26.658 --> 35:28.294
He's a remarkable human being.

35:28.327 --> 35:32.564
Nine months ago, I met Derek
on a bus bound for New York.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.699
He poured his heart out.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.567
He... he shared his pain.

35:35.601 --> 35:39.238
And he told me a story about
how he was humiliated by a cop.

35:39.271 --> 35:42.941
Beaten... but never arrested.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.611
Derek was homeless and
unable to find a job.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.479
He was so broken
by the system

35:47.513 --> 35:48.614
that he just wanted
to disappear.

35:48.647 --> 35:49.948
So that's what inspired you

35:49.981 --> 35:51.817
to find the video
and post it online?

35:51.850 --> 35:54.686
That's not Derek in that video.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.688
The irony is--
is my brother had

35:56.722 --> 35:58.557
several videos to choose from.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.659
Destiny chose this one.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.828
So where's Derek now?
I don't know.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.696
Then who's the man
in that video?

36:04.730 --> 36:06.365
Does it matter?

36:06.398 --> 36:08.700
They're all Derek Noels.

36:08.734 --> 36:09.901
You're not racist.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.571
You're a coward.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.573
This isn't about science.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.509
This is about vengeance,
because you hate your brother.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.212
How do you think your wife,
Nicole, is gonna feel

36:20.246 --> 36:24.516
when she finds out her husband
is responsible for all of this?

36:26.385 --> 36:28.720
Enjoy reading
your thesis in prison.

36:28.754 --> 36:31.290
Only after bloodshed
is there healing.

36:32.758 --> 36:35.594
9/11, Sandy Hook,

36:35.627 --> 36:38.730
the Charleston
church shooting.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.766
It's the only way.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.373
RYAN:
Something is not right.

36:47.406 --> 36:50.542
He's extremely calm, much too
confident in the face of defeat.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.311
He's got another play.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.779
Did you get anything
off his phone?

36:53.812 --> 36:54.913
No, it was wiped clean.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.848
(indistinct chatter
about phones)

37:02.988 --> 37:04.623
Chief Richards,
what's going on?

37:04.656 --> 37:05.491
I'm on with Causley.

37:05.524 --> 37:06.725
The safe house has
been compromised.

37:06.758 --> 37:10.862
His GPS coordinates are being
sent to every phone in the city.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.264
His detail is headed
back to the precinct.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.465
RYAN:
This is his play.

37:13.499 --> 37:14.733
This is Gaines.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.802
He wanted to make sure that his
brother was slaughtered tonight.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.003
How's he doing
this, Nelson?

37:19.671 --> 37:21.773
NELSON: Has to be
an auto-dialer.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.009
Question is--
how'd he tag him?

37:24.042 --> 37:25.944
It's the GPS in the car,
it's got to be.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.946
Protocol is to sweep
the car before it moves.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.948
And the GPS is turned off...
It's the phones,

37:29.981 --> 37:31.850
The phones.
I need to talk to Causley.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.754
RYAN: Officer Causley, this is
Special Agent Ryan with the FBI.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.756
Listen to me carefully,
I need you and your detail

37:37.789 --> 37:39.458
to toss your phones now.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.460
You're being tracked.

37:41.493 --> 37:42.728
Phones.

37:44.830 --> 37:45.764
It's done.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.800
NELSON:
Didn't work.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.769
He's still tagged.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.904
The tracker has to be
on him, hidden.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.440
You two, get a team,
bring Causley back.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.475
On it.
RYAN: Officer Causley,

37:56.508 --> 37:58.777
I believe your brother
planted a tracker on you.

37:58.810 --> 37:59.778
It's small, it should be hidden

37:59.811 --> 38:01.647
on something he knows
you would keep with you.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.788
CAUSLEY: He hid the tracker
in my badge?

38:09.821 --> 38:11.557
Sneaky son of a...

38:14.059 --> 38:15.727
MAN: Oh, my God!
WOMAN: What was that?!

38:15.761 --> 38:17.363
Somebody call 911!
Hey, man.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.864
Isn't that that cop?

38:26.472 --> 38:28.039
Call an ambulance,
I've got Causley!

38:28.073 --> 38:30.008
NELSON: Hello?
Yo, listen, listen.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.010
We need an EMT over
at Avenue 24 and D Street.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.044
Hurry up! Come quick!

38:34.380 --> 38:35.447
Come on!

38:35.481 --> 38:37.583
That's the cop
that killed Derek Noels!

38:39.117 --> 38:40.719
Get back now!

38:41.853 --> 38:43.722
Come on!
MUNDO: Get him back
to the precinct, go!

38:47.092 --> 38:49.361
Stay back! Stay back!

39:03.475 --> 39:05.877
Hurry, hurry, the tracker.

39:05.911 --> 39:07.012
It's my badge, my badge.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.447
Get in.

39:15.421 --> 39:16.922
(tires screeching)

39:21.192 --> 39:23.995
(chanting):
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

39:24.029 --> 39:27.866
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

39:27.899 --> 39:30.869
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

39:30.902 --> 39:34.973
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

39:35.006 --> 39:39.010
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

39:39.044 --> 39:42.581
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

39:42.614 --> 39:45.851
Where is Derek Noels?
Justice knows no death!

39:45.884 --> 39:47.519
Where is Derek Noels?

39:47.553 --> 39:48.787
Get him out of sight.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.556
Are you two hurt?

39:50.589 --> 39:51.857
No.
