00:11.078 --> 00:14.246
(dramatic music)

00:33.234 --> 00:34.233
- I can't see.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.267
I can't frickin' see.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.169
- Calm down Charlie.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.037
Charlie.

00:40.641 --> 00:41.507
Charlie.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.442
Charlie.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.410
- What?

00:44.412 --> 00:45.707
- How many have you taken?

00:47.648 --> 00:48.480
How many?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.215
- What is that smell.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.517
- How many Charlie?

00:52.686 --> 00:54.686
- That smell Megan, what
the hell is that smell?

01:03.831 --> 01:05.864
- Jesus, you can't
even keep track

01:05.866 --> 01:07.399
of what you steal.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.334
- Close the door.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.169
- What are you
gonna do with these?

01:10.171 --> 01:11.236
- Close the door!

01:14.842 --> 01:15.841
- [Megan] We need to talk.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.176
- We are talking.

01:18.079 --> 01:18.844
- Properly.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.079
- We are talking properly.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.614
- If we were, you
wouldn't be zooting.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.316
- Oh, here we go again.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.250
What are you my mother?

01:25.252 --> 01:26.685
- Well, I might as well be.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.353
Who else is gonna lecture you?

01:28.355 --> 01:29.788
Barton?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.356
- Barton's cool man.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.095
- Look, you know what this
is doing to you right?

01:37.465 --> 01:38.330
Right?

01:40.868 --> 01:42.768
- Delusions,
blackouts, deja vus.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.272
- You want to throw your
memory into a grinder,

01:47.274 --> 01:49.174
you be my guest Charlie,

01:49.176 --> 01:50.242
but don't drag me in it.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.577
Then bloody leave.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.252
Megan.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.153
Megan!

02:10.531 --> 02:12.331
Wait, don't go.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.432
- I'm late for work.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.234
- What work, there ain't work.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.435
- It is.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.369
It's a work trial.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.238
- It's slave labor, Megan.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.639
They make you work
for free and you hope

02:20.641 --> 02:22.241
you get a job at the end, right?

02:22.243 --> 02:24.209
- It's none of your business.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.711
- I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.179
I want you to get out.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.213
- What?

02:28.215 --> 02:31.683
- Look, yeah, I'm a shit.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.919
But I care about you.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.588
You know, I'll fix things.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.890
I'm make them right.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.431
- Get Barton to clean this
place up if you won't.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.905
(gentle music)

03:13.961 --> 03:17.196
(keyboard clicking)

03:50.231 --> 03:52.297
- That is not enough.

03:52.299 --> 03:53.532
- At least it's there, right?

03:53.534 --> 03:55.801
- So you just want to
come in here and sign on

03:55.803 --> 03:57.236
and go home.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.972
That's not a proper
work search Charlie.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.357
- What more do you want?

04:01.358 --> 04:02.741
- I want a proper
work search for once.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.676
- We go through this every time.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.246
How about fast forwarding
it to the last part.

04:07.248 --> 04:10.816
- Listen, you've been
signing on for a while now.

04:10.818 --> 04:14.586
And absolutely zero work
progress has been made.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.255
What is it, is this zootropic.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.591
- I'm not on zoots, man.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.461
Besides it's none of
your business what I do.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.862
- Oh, it is.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.297
We're paying you decent money

04:25.299 --> 04:27.933
to do a work search,
not go and jack up.

04:27.935 --> 04:28.934
- Yeah, I'm working on that.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.103
- Are you?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.271
I've heard you've been selling
meat to dodgy restaurants.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.973
What other things you
got going on aside.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.742
- Selling goat
shit to Starbucks.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.280
- It's a pity you're
not like Megan.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.282
Yeah, she's gonna have
a proper job soon.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.884
- Zoo-Heads don't get jobs.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.620
- Listen, she's clean.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.356
Which is the sad part, isn't it,

04:51.358 --> 04:52.424
because you're probably
gonna send her over

04:52.426 --> 04:53.492
the edge again.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.865
Have you heard of Infinity?

04:59.867 --> 05:01.400
- Those brain butchers.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.634
- Memories.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.902
They're a memory clinic.

05:06.774 --> 05:10.809
Listen, they've got a
rehabilitation program,

05:10.811 --> 05:12.010
they're trialing it through us.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.945
- What us, unemployed
scum guinea pigs.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.747
Yeah, no thanks.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.015
- It's not a choice.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.116
- You can't force me
to go to that place.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.484
I don't want anyone
inside my head,

05:19.486 --> 05:20.686
not them, not you.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.354
- You've got nothing
to worry about.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.490
I mean it's only memory loop.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.758
- Yeah, I'm not bloody doing it.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.863
- Well, the appointment's
already been made.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.936
- And what if I don't go.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.907
- Well, I'll just stop all
of your benefits completely

05:41.909 --> 05:45.410
and then I'd personally
go to the police

05:45.412 --> 05:48.046
and tell them about
this zootropics.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.451
- You can't do that.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.455
- I can do anything I want.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.624
- Not in my brain, man, no one.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.735
(door slamming)

06:09.737 --> 06:13.572
(upbeat technological music)

06:24.418 --> 06:25.584
I need to talk.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.585
- Meat's gone bad.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.594
Suffocation of currant.

06:39.466 --> 06:42.401
Unification or conformity.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.404
There.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.011
This about your father again?

06:55.482 --> 06:56.715
You're still seeing him?

06:59.453 --> 07:01.486
- Welfare wants me
to go to Infinity.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.090
- What?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.462
Holy shit.

07:13.834 --> 07:14.666
Are you getting a memory loop.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.134
- Yeah.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.437
- Why, are they handing out
freebies at welfare now.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.872
- Part of their drug
rehabilitation bullshit.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.107
It's a con to get
into my head, man.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.709
- No, brother, this
is the real deal.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.445
It'll be good for you.

07:26.447 --> 07:27.512
You'll finally get clean.

07:27.514 --> 07:28.747
- I'm not doing it.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.849
- You are doing it.

07:30.851 --> 07:31.750
- I'm not.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.757
- You're desperate
for a way out,

07:38.759 --> 07:40.992
but you're afraid.

07:42.496 --> 07:46.031
Afraid to circumcise
your heart and be free.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.867
Stay afraid and
you'll cease to exist.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.203
You'll belong with those
selfie taking maggots

07:51.205 --> 07:52.571
and their empty photos.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.209
You're doing it.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.679
Now, go, get rid of that meat.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.880
Then let's get to work.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.216
We've got a lot of
doors to know on

08:04.218 --> 08:05.116
for some sales.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.919
- You don't get to
boss me around Barton.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.860
- Who else will father you then?

08:16.763 --> 08:19.564
(gentle music)

08:23.537 --> 08:26.004
(phone ringing)

08:26.006 --> 08:27.672
- [Megan] Hi, this is Megan.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.641
Leave a message and
I'll get back to you.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.977
- Hey, it's me,
pick up will you.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.046
I'm trying to reach you.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.315
Sorry for messing up.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.549
Please call me.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.787
(gentle music)

08:47.561 --> 08:50.529
(dramatic music)

09:14.688 --> 09:16.922
- [Father] Hey, Charlie.

09:27.901 --> 09:32.037
- A limp dick in your
and soaking in stale cum.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.205
Masturbation's become your only

09:34.207 --> 09:35.740
prayer for salvation kid.

09:45.218 --> 09:48.787
(technological jingles)

09:53.193 --> 09:56.828
(dramatic drums beating)

10:00.767 --> 10:03.702
- You're very lucky to
have been chosen Charlie.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.936
- What happened?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.205
Who are you?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.273
- I'm Dr. Pierce.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.841
You passed out.

10:09.843 --> 10:10.909
You're malnourished.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.011
When was the last time you ate?

10:13.013 --> 10:14.613
- What's my stomach
got to do with my head.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.615
- If you undergo looping,

10:16.617 --> 10:17.282
your vitals need to be spot on.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.750
- What is this?

10:18.752 --> 10:20.719
- We're memory mapping you.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.904
- What?

10:21.905 --> 10:23.088
- In order for memory
looping to work,

10:23.090 --> 10:24.956
we need to do a clean
sweep of your mind,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.958
check for any anomalies
or memory corruption.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.960
And so far you've
got quite a bit.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.061
- A bit of what?

10:30.063 --> 10:31.129
- Memory corruption.

10:32.699 --> 10:35.634
You have any reoccurring dreams?

10:35.636 --> 10:38.103
- Dreams, I thought
this was about memories?

10:38.105 --> 10:39.938
- Dreams are
indicative of memories.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.875
- I only have one dream.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.311
Breaker's Beach, I was
six, building a sandcastle,

10:46.313 --> 10:47.779
that's about it.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.247
- That may be a
little young for us to

10:49.249 --> 10:50.649
loop you into.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.251
Anything significant
happen there?

10:53.253 --> 10:54.119
- No.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.190
- How long have you been using.

10:59.192 --> 11:02.761
- Don't knowú,
three, four years.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.196
- PCP?

11:05.198 --> 11:06.364
- Mm-hmm.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.432
- Heroin?

11:07.434 --> 11:08.266
- Yeah.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.100
- Methamphetamine?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.669
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.671 --> 11:11.703
- Anything else.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.071
- Nope.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.739
- Zootropics?

11:15.676 --> 11:18.309
You certain it's only
heroin at the moment?

11:18.311 --> 11:19.778
- Yeah, why?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.012
- It's best if
you're honest Charlie

11:21.014 --> 11:22.480
before we start the looping.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.783
- Are you gonna tell me
what this looping is?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.790
- We loop you into
a memory of yours

11:31.792 --> 11:32.857
when you were sober.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.895
You inhabit your past self.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.197
That allows your
mind to progress

11:39.199 --> 11:40.799
to its original state,

11:40.801 --> 11:42.033
healing damaged neurons

11:42.035 --> 11:44.235
and realigning
neurotransmitters.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.804
- Then what?

11:45.806 --> 11:46.971
- Then we bring you back.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.307
After that comes the hard part.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.709
- Hard part?

11:50.711 --> 11:53.211
- Once we bring you out
of the loop and back

11:53.213 --> 11:55.714
to your present day body,
your mind may be fixed,

11:55.716 --> 11:57.916
but your body will
still be drug ridden.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.751
We have an after care
program for that.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.486
- So what you're
saying is I come back,

12:01.488 --> 12:03.021
and I'm still messed up.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.056
- It's two stages.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.791
Looping takes care of your mind.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.326
We take care of your
body afterwards.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.828
- You mess with my brain doing

12:09.830 --> 12:11.896
some back to the future
crap to it won't work.

12:11.898 --> 12:15.366
- It works, even
though it's a trial.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.868
You won't even be
aware that you're in

12:16.870 --> 12:18.169
a memory repeating itself.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.044
- What's that?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.746
- Urine sample.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.447
We need to do a blood test, too.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.483
We need a full breakdown
of what's in your system.

12:31.485 --> 12:32.383
- What?

12:34.488 --> 12:37.288
(dramatic music)

12:44.831 --> 12:47.999
- [Father] They're
gonna know son.

12:48.001 --> 12:51.936
They're gonna know and
they'll eat you up.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.404
- Shut up, shut it.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.109
So what are the results?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.578
- We won't have
them until later.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.813
We'll give you a
call to let you know

13:01.815 --> 13:03.181
if you're suitable.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.449
- If I'm not?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.551
- The welfare office
gets a full report.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.188
Get dressed, you're free to go.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.948
(laughing)

13:38.385 --> 13:40.385
- Hey space boy,
how was Infinity.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.619
- You went to Infinity?

13:41.621 --> 13:43.388
- Yes, Megan, I
went to Infinity.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.322
You wouldn't bloody
know since you

13:44.324 --> 13:45.924
didn't pick up your phone.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.393
- Whoa, whoa, chill brother.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.828
What happened?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.229
- They did a drug
test on me, man.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.931
- Yeah, that's pretty standard.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.033
- What you knew,
you fucking knew.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.968
- What the hell were
you doing at Infinity?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.837
- Of course I knew,
I interned there,

13:58.839 --> 14:00.371
well until somebody
fucked me over.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.506
- You should have told me.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.907
- For you to do what, huh?

14:02.909 --> 14:04.509
If you didn't go welfare
would screw you over.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.911
- Okay, now that I've
screwed anyway by it.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.513
- Did you get one
of those memory loop

14:08.515 --> 14:09.581
trials from welfare?

14:11.384 --> 14:12.884
Your lucky fucker.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.022
- Relax.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.891
Zootropics are untraceable.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.426
- What do you mean untraceable?

14:21.428 --> 14:22.927
- They can't detect anything.

14:22.929 --> 14:25.964
I bet you asked you to be
honest and shit, right?

14:25.966 --> 14:29.400
It's because they
can't trace shit.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.970
- So you're doing it right?

14:31.972 --> 14:33.304
- No.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.639
- You are doing it?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.074
- What's it to you?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.342
- What's it to me?

14:37.344 --> 14:39.110
The fact that I've had
to put up with your shit

14:39.112 --> 14:41.512
since I met you, that's
what's up with me.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.348
- Here we go again,
another bitch fit.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.016
- You little shit.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.118
Do you even know
how lucky you are?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.587
Do you know how much the
memory programs cost.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.556
An ungrateful little
shit gets free treatment

14:51.558 --> 14:53.191
and you won't go.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.526
- Get the fuck off me.

14:55.528 --> 14:59.330
Oh, you're gonna punch me
Megan, come on, hit me.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.565
- That is it.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.135
I swear to God,
I'm done with you.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.037
- Just leave.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.171
Who's stopping you.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.910
- What the hell
is wrong with you.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.578
- She can't mind
her own business.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.914
- You are her business.

15:22.989 --> 15:23.922
- [Charlie] What?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.125
- Self-destruction is imminent.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.129
Self-preservation is decadent.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.645
Hey, hey, hey.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.314
- Fucking I've had it with him.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.183
He's a mess and you,
you encourage him.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.618
- I do not encourage him.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.320
- Where's he getting
his stash of zoots from?

15:55.322 --> 15:56.521
- From me.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.189
I actually find that
quite offensive.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.958
You're the one who
got all worked up

15:59.960 --> 16:01.092
when you heard about
his trip to Infinity,

16:01.094 --> 16:02.226
so what's up.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.028
- I couldn't get on the trial.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.396
- Why not?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.598
- Because I was
zooting and welfare

16:07.600 --> 16:10.101
thought it was too risky.

16:16.710 --> 16:19.077
Barton, don't you
get memory shortage?

16:22.048 --> 16:24.082
- There's a large part of memory

16:24.084 --> 16:25.683
that's really
messed up in there,

16:25.685 --> 16:30.588
but sort of the price we
pay for zooting, right?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.124
- Doesn't that bother you?

16:33.126 --> 16:37.261
- Just learn to
make up my own past.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.596
- Barton, that's denial.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.598
- No, denial is paying taxes

16:40.600 --> 16:42.734
and then believing that
you're a good person.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.506
- I can't remember
any of my childhood.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.009
- Can't remember any of it?

16:56.249 --> 16:58.683
Look, the life you own
doesn't have to own you.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.819
You can do anything
you want with it.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.355
You can even trade it on eBay.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.357
- Barton, it's a part of me.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.327
No matter how hard I
try, I can't remember

17:09.329 --> 17:11.596
any of it.

17:11.598 --> 17:16.200
What I was like as
a kid, what I did,

17:16.202 --> 17:19.737
my hobbies, friends, my parents.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.073
They're just blank faces.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.540
- You're starting over.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.376
You're getting clean,

17:25.377 --> 17:29.147
you got that new work
trial at the restaurant.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.148
- They fired me.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.182
- Fuck.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.218
- It's gone shit Barton.

17:34.220 --> 17:39.157
I was saving my welfare
for memory reconstruction.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.625
- Seriously?

17:40.627 --> 17:42.627
- Yeah, I'm piss broke.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.262
I can't even afford to eat

17:44.264 --> 17:46.831
and I'm trying to save
to get my memory back.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.268
I'm a joke.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.204
- You want it really bad, huh?

17:58.211 --> 17:59.277
How much is it?

18:00.246 --> 18:01.245
- Don't ask.

18:02.348 --> 18:06.150
- [Barton] Have you
look into payment plans?

18:06.152 --> 18:10.588
- Look at me Barton, I
can't face going in there.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.657
They'll think I'm a cheap skank.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.093
- Charlie's the cheap skank.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.561
He's getting free
treatment and he's still

18:16.563 --> 18:17.528
bitching about it.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.800
- I really thought
I could help him.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.106
Most people just
don't want to change.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.242
- You caring for Charlie's
not gonna fill the gap

18:31.244 --> 18:32.543
you have for your parents.

18:32.545 --> 18:36.180
Parents you can't
even remember having.

18:36.182 --> 18:40.618
So if you want the real
deal, then go for it.

18:42.922 --> 18:43.754
- You think so?

18:43.756 --> 18:45.289
- I want to help you.

18:47.861 --> 18:48.759
- Really?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.296
- Selling dildos to
lonely housewives

18:52.298 --> 18:54.632
actually does bring
in a lot of money.

18:55.902 --> 18:56.934
- Thanks, Barton.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.275
I'll think about it.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.179
Just don't tell Charlie.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.315
- I wouldn't tell him.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.527
(water flowing)

19:23.796 --> 19:26.597
(dramatic music)

19:57.564 --> 19:58.462
- No.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.802
- [Father] Charlie.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.773
Charlie.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.450
(dramatic music)

20:24.857 --> 20:25.756
Charlie.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.259
Charlie.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.327
- Go away.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.463
- [Father] Time
for a fix Charlie.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.497
Charlie.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.637
(heavy breathing)

21:01.294 --> 21:04.262
You're messing it
all up again son.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.948
- Barton, Barton,
Barty, come out man.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.083
Open the door, open
the door please.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.686
Open the fucking door you fuck.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.087
- [Father] Get your
fucking arse over here

21:30.089 --> 21:32.323
you fucking little shit.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.688
- [Barton] Do your own cooking.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.412
- [Megan] How real will
it be once I have it?

22:28.414 --> 22:29.780
- It will be your
complete memory.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.882
All of it will be
real and intact.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.551
- How can it?

22:33.553 --> 22:35.886
You're filling in gaps of
my memory with odd bits.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.622
- Think of it like
skin grafting.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.591
We simply take a healthy
substitute and mold

22:40.593 --> 22:42.760
it to suit the missing memory.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.096
- What, how can you
mold my adult memories

22:45.098 --> 22:46.564
into my childhood ones?

22:46.566 --> 22:47.798
How can it fit?

22:47.800 --> 22:50.134
- That's why we
sometimes use dreams.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.369
- Dreams?

22:51.371 --> 22:53.104
- We use fragments of dreams

22:53.106 --> 22:55.906
to substitute childhood
missing memories.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.642
- I don't dream about
my childhood Dr. Pierce.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.545
I never had.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.013
- After the addiction
you may never have,

23:03.015 --> 23:05.516
but before you
certainly would have.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.385
The mind is a
complex place Megan.

23:07.387 --> 23:11.088
It has dark alleys
and many locked doors.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.857
That's where we come in.

23:12.859 --> 23:15.726
We simply find the
doors and unlock them.

23:15.728 --> 23:19.630
I like to think the mind
is never truly damaged.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.099
It's a hard fix, but
never truly damaged.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.702
- Hard fix.

23:25.671 --> 23:28.172
That's why it's so
expensive, right?

23:28.174 --> 23:31.776
- Memory reconstruction is
a very delicate procedure

23:31.778 --> 23:35.546
and yes, it's one of our
most costly packages.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.683
- I really need this Dr. Pierce.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.086
I brought it on myself.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.656
I've even started praying.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.092
But I don't think God is stupid.

23:48.094 --> 23:52.129
He gave me something
and I took to away.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.199
- We all make mistakes Megan.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.034
It took a lot of courage for you

23:57.036 --> 23:59.603
to come out as a
zootropic addict.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.906
If God didn't want you
to have your memory back,

24:01.908 --> 24:04.542
a place like Infinity
wouldn't exist.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.576
We're here to help.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.246
- Do you have a payment plan.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.615
- Before we discuss
that, we need to talk

24:11.617 --> 24:13.083
about the risks.

24:13.085 --> 24:16.220
- Okay, well, what are they?

24:16.222 --> 24:19.623
- If the synopsis for
your childhood memory

24:19.625 --> 24:23.160
reject substitutes,
a backlash may occur,

24:23.162 --> 24:26.697
creating a complete wipe out
of your long-term memory.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.599
- What?

24:28.601 --> 24:30.000
- You have to think
of it like a computer,

24:30.002 --> 24:31.836
crashing, losing
all the bits memory.

24:31.838 --> 24:34.004
- I'm not a bloody PC, though.

24:34.006 --> 24:36.674
- It's a very small
percentage of that happening.

24:36.676 --> 24:39.276
But it is something you
need to think about.

24:40.613 --> 24:43.747
- There is one dream that I have

24:43.749 --> 24:47.585
and I'm wearing
this wedding dress

24:48.287 --> 24:51.055
and I'm holding this child and

24:51.057 --> 24:53.224
it won't stop crying.

24:53.226 --> 24:55.626
It doesn't make sense.

24:56.295 --> 24:58.796
- Dreams are amalgamations

24:58.798 --> 25:01.131
of various
psychological processes

25:01.133 --> 25:03.501
and it could be your
mother holding you

25:03.503 --> 25:05.236
or something as
simple as you playing

25:05.238 --> 25:06.737
with a doll as a child.

25:07.707 --> 25:08.939
- No.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.007
It wasn't a doll.

25:11.143 --> 25:14.278
And I couldn't get
it to stop crying.

25:49.782 --> 25:53.083
- Sunny skies with isolated
acid showers in the north.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.890
Zootropics go from pill
format to baby formula.

26:05.831 --> 26:09.300
City official rapes
dog, tweets selfie.

26:11.771 --> 26:14.705
(groaning)

26:14.707 --> 26:17.141
Looks like mama's gonna
have to clean up again.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.016
Oh, my God.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.955
Aw, squishy.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.857
(phone buzzing)

26:35.861 --> 26:37.795
Hello, Charlie speaking.

26:38.998 --> 26:39.930
- [Dr. Pierce] Charlie, this
is Dr. Pierce from Infinity.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.198
We've got your lab results back.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.600
- Splendid, jolly good.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.335
- [Dr. Pierce] Yes,
well, they're all clear

26:44.337 --> 26:45.869
so you're good to go.

26:45.871 --> 26:46.770
Can you come in today?

26:46.772 --> 26:48.339
- Today?

26:48.341 --> 26:51.175
- [Dr. Pierce] Yes,
today, in an hour?

26:51.177 --> 26:53.043
- Wow, yeah.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.080
I'll be there.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.416
Looking forward
to it, God bless.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.124
- I feel like shit.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.391
- Well, you shit
yourself if that helps.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.660
- What's going on?

27:14.934 --> 27:16.367
- Soap.

27:16.369 --> 27:18.369
I need lots of soap.

27:19.905 --> 27:23.807
(funky technological music)

27:24.944 --> 27:25.876
In anticipation of your suicide,

27:25.878 --> 27:26.977
please make sure tray tables

27:26.979 --> 27:30.047
are in their full
upright position.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.882
- What are you doing?

27:33.019 --> 27:34.918
- Getting you ready for school.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.197
- Charlie.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.133
Charlie.

27:50.736 --> 27:51.902
Because of your severe
memory corruption,

27:51.904 --> 27:53.170
we've had very
little to work with,

27:53.172 --> 27:55.706
so you'll probably
experience fluctuations

27:55.708 --> 27:59.777
which take the form of
inconsistencies, hallucinations.

27:59.779 --> 28:00.444
- What?

28:00.446 --> 28:01.445
- Relax.

28:01.447 --> 28:02.846
We're in complete control.

28:02.848 --> 28:03.414
We can pull the
plug at any time.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.314
- Screw this.

28:05.985 --> 28:06.950
What the fuck is this.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.419
- They're cautionary restraints

28:08.421 --> 28:10.254
so you don't hurt
yourself in the loop.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.488
- Get me the fuck out of this.

28:11.490 --> 28:12.322
- [Dr. Pierce] Relax.

28:12.324 --> 28:13.957
- Get me out.

28:13.959 --> 28:16.493
Pierce, you fuck, get me
the fuck out of this chair.

28:16.495 --> 28:17.861
What the hell is that?

28:17.863 --> 28:19.229
- Something to calm you down.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.699
- You're fucking sick.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.833
Don't, don't.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.053
Please, please.

28:26.054 --> 28:27.237
I can't go back, I
can't go back, please.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.238
He's there.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.940
He's there.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.875
- Charlie relax.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.377
It's only a memory,
it's not real,

28:33.379 --> 28:35.045
no one can hurt you.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.881
- You don't fucking understand.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.085
Pierce you fuck.

28:42.088 --> 28:45.089
(dramatic music)

29:08.247 --> 29:11.815
(computer keys beeping)

29:16.956 --> 29:19.957
(dramatic music)

29:38.978 --> 29:40.144
- What the?

29:42.181 --> 29:45.182
(computer beeping)

29:46.085 --> 29:47.918
- [Father] Charlie.

29:54.794 --> 29:58.128
(Charlie screaming)

29:58.130 --> 30:00.364
- Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

30:01.801 --> 30:04.868
(Charlie screaming)

30:21.287 --> 30:24.855
(heart monitor beeping)

30:40.573 --> 30:41.572
- I can't see.

30:41.574 --> 30:43.173
Frickin' sun in my eye.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.208
- Calm down.

30:46.378 --> 30:47.244
Charlie.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.519
- I was on the beach just now.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.221
- What Breaker's Beach?

30:57.223 --> 30:58.488
You're just tripping.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.556
How many did you take?

31:00.359 --> 31:01.225
- What's that smell?

31:01.227 --> 31:02.292
- How many.

31:08.167 --> 31:11.134
Jesus, you can't even keep
track of what you steal.

31:11.136 --> 31:13.003
Put that down.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.278
How many?

31:22.114 --> 31:23.881
Charlie, how many.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.316
- How many what?

31:26.318 --> 31:28.085
- Zoots for crying out loud,

31:28.087 --> 31:30.354
how many pills did you shoot up?

31:30.356 --> 31:32.022
- You need to talk right?

31:32.024 --> 31:33.490
- What?

31:33.492 --> 31:34.992
- That's why you're here.

31:38.264 --> 31:41.031
- Well, I've been meaning
for talk to you for a while.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.200
- You can't break up with me.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.351
- What?

31:44.352 --> 31:45.501
- Not right now,
something's not right.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.037
- What the bloody
hell do you mean

31:47.039 --> 31:48.138
I can't break up
with you right now.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.339
- [Charlie] Please,
I need you to listen.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.574
- Oh, what now you want to talk.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.075
- Ah, shut up Megan, just.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.178
Megan.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.013
Megan!

31:58.284 --> 32:00.083
I was at the beach
Megan, the bloody beach.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.251
- I have seriously
had it with you.

32:03.989 --> 32:05.222
- Wait, wait.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.256
- No, I'm late for work.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.090
- Listen.

32:07.092 --> 32:07.925
- No.

32:07.927 --> 32:08.692
- Please.

32:08.694 --> 32:09.626
- You dream about that beach

32:09.628 --> 32:11.361
all the time for a reason.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.931
Sort it out Charlie.

32:29.682 --> 32:32.582
- And what if I don't go?

32:32.584 --> 32:36.286
- Well, then I'll cut
off all your benefits.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.289
- [Father] It's
all rewind Charlie.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.125
- Zootropics.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.996
- You can't do that.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.497
- I can do whatever I want.

32:57.676 --> 33:01.078
(technological music)

33:05.384 --> 33:06.216
- I need to talk.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.351
- The meat's gone bad.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.689
Suffocation of current.

33:12.691 --> 33:16.326
Unification or conformity.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.731
- I'm having some
messed up deja vus, man.

33:20.733 --> 33:21.999
- Is this about
your father again?

33:22.001 --> 33:22.766
You still seeing him?

33:22.768 --> 33:24.301
- Listen.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.370
- That's the zoots talking.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.671
- The fridge, the
welfare advisor,

33:27.673 --> 33:30.240
what he said about Infinity.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.543
- Holy shit.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.281
Are you getting a memory loop.

33:38.283 --> 33:41.218
- I knew that, I knew you
was gonna say all of that.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.719
- [Father] Charlie.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.457
- Where the hell
did that come from?

33:47.459 --> 33:48.558
- What's that Chuck?

33:51.563 --> 33:53.663
- The bear, the frickin' bear.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.632
- You've always had
that thing, man.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.137
You're doing this loop.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.442
- Is this some
kind of sick joke.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.178
Where did you get this from?

34:08.179 --> 34:09.713
- You've always had it with you.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.815
- You're messing with me Barton.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.417
This bear can't be
here, it's a fake.

34:13.418 --> 34:14.583
- A fake?

34:14.585 --> 34:16.453
So it's a fake bear.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.422
- Don't play with me
Barton, I'm warning you.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.123
- You've always had
that thing, man.

34:21.126 --> 34:23.293
It's your only memory
from your childhood.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.429
- No, he took it.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.398
- You're getting worse Chuck.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.634
You need to do this,
this needs to stop.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.271
Megan's scared.

34:34.273 --> 34:38.574
I don't think Megan wants
to be with you anymore man.

34:42.347 --> 34:45.248
You seriously need to get clean.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.118
- You think I'm fuckin'
stupid Bart, huh?

34:48.120 --> 34:49.453
Get a fucking fake
bear and fuck with me.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.388
- Christ, listen to yourself.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.621
It's a fuckin' teddy bear.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.591
- I don't need you
to get in here.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.859
- Well, guess what,
there's not much in there

34:55.860 --> 34:57.427
to get into.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.801
(grunting)

35:06.305 --> 35:11.374
Chill the fuck out.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.442
- Fuck!

35:16.715 --> 35:18.849
- [Barton] I've had it.

35:18.851 --> 35:20.217
I've been patient.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.519
I've been saintly
and all you ever are

35:22.521 --> 35:24.754
is a spoiled fucking brat.

35:33.165 --> 35:34.164
I didn't want to do this bro,

35:34.166 --> 35:34.898
but you leave me no choice.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.301
- What is that?

35:38.303 --> 35:39.836
What is that?

35:39.838 --> 35:43.140
- Inhibitor when
you're zoot crazy.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.410
Resist the passive
aggression of conformity

35:47.412 --> 35:51.348
and indulge in violence
and oppression.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.482
- Let go of me!

35:53.552 --> 35:54.818
Let go of me!

35:54.820 --> 35:57.721
- All sons ride down
dark alleys Chuck.

35:57.723 --> 35:58.555
You're lost.

35:58.557 --> 35:59.956
Looking for a god.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.392
To fear, to worship, to
become like those we worship.

36:05.931 --> 36:09.166
(Charlie screaming)

36:10.769 --> 36:13.904
You worship an absent
father you become lost.

36:13.906 --> 36:15.305
Just like him.

36:18.544 --> 36:21.511
(dramatic music)

36:46.538 --> 36:49.272
(baby crying)

36:50.275 --> 36:51.675
- [Charlie] Megan.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.955
- He wouldn't stop crying.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.523
He lost his toy.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.861
I have tried everything.

37:19.538 --> 37:20.937
Maybe you can try.

37:39.758 --> 37:44.594
- [Dr. Pierce] Charlie, it's
Dr. Pierce, can you hear me?

38:23.035 --> 38:25.869
(drums thumping)

38:31.610 --> 38:34.678
(sighing)

38:34.680 --> 38:35.578
- What are the results?

38:36.615 --> 38:39.082
- Charlie, do you
use zootropics?

38:41.119 --> 38:42.018
- No.

38:43.322 --> 38:45.855
- So why is there a
zootropic inhibitor

38:45.857 --> 38:46.756
in your system?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.595
- My friend was messing around.

38:52.597 --> 38:53.530
- You do realize
the implications

38:53.532 --> 38:54.864
of using zootropics, right?

38:58.103 --> 39:00.003
- Don't tell them, please.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.371
- I have no choice.

39:01.373 --> 39:02.672
- Please don't, they'll
cut off my benefits.

39:02.674 --> 39:03.640
- You should be more interested

39:03.642 --> 39:05.108
in what the police have to say.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.710
- You think I enjoy
signing on, huh?

39:06.712 --> 39:08.678
Why don't you fucking try it,

39:08.680 --> 39:12.916
living like a piece of shit
that everyone laughs at.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.023
(sighing)

39:29.701 --> 39:31.401
- What the hell?

39:31.403 --> 39:33.036
- Hey, space boy,
how was Infinity?

39:34.139 --> 39:35.038
- Infinity?

39:38.110 --> 39:41.077
- How was it?

39:41.079 --> 39:43.179
- [Megan] Charlie?

39:43.181 --> 39:44.414
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.682
- Stop.

39:45.684 --> 39:46.649
- I'm fucked because
of you, Barton,

39:46.651 --> 39:48.051
I'm totally fucked.

39:48.053 --> 39:48.952
- Enough.

39:51.623 --> 39:52.622
What?

39:52.624 --> 39:53.857
What happened?

40:12.110 --> 40:14.577
Jesus Charlie, you
look like shit.

40:20.685 --> 40:21.918
You went to Infinity?

40:23.822 --> 40:25.188
Did welfare send you?

40:31.963 --> 40:32.996
What happened?

40:35.634 --> 40:36.866
- The drug test on me.

40:41.239 --> 40:42.222
They know I'm zooting.

40:42.223 --> 40:43.206
Fucking Barton spiked
me with an inhibitor.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.073
They traced it.

40:45.544 --> 40:46.543
- Shit.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.846
- I'm done for Megan.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.550
They're call welfare,
the police, I'm done for.

40:53.552 --> 40:54.818
- Listen.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.252
Everything's gonna
be okay, all right.

41:00.759 --> 41:03.259
- Megan, I think I'm in a loop.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.662
- What?

41:05.664 --> 41:07.030
- My deja vus, they're bad,

41:07.032 --> 41:07.997
but they're not the zoots type.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.599
- You're just tripping Charlie.

41:09.601 --> 41:10.900
- No, no, this is different.

41:10.902 --> 41:11.901
- Listen to me.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.536
- No, you listen.

41:13.538 --> 41:14.471
Why can't you ever trust me.

41:14.473 --> 41:17.140
- Hey, I do trust you, okay?

41:24.783 --> 41:25.849
I did.

41:28.053 --> 41:28.952
- What?

41:31.957 --> 41:33.523
- You've changed Charlie.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.627
You've got to stop running
away from your past.

41:37.629 --> 41:39.195
You keep trying to make
things right with me,

41:39.197 --> 41:41.931
but it's not about us.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.501
It's about you.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.102
And there's only one person

41:46.104 --> 41:47.637
you've got to let go of.

41:47.639 --> 41:48.638
- No.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.739
- Your dad is dead Charlie.

41:49.741 --> 41:50.940
- For Christ's sake Megan.

41:50.942 --> 41:51.975
Why do you bring
this up all the time.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.776
Why can't you just drop it.

41:53.778 --> 41:54.944
- Because I love you.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.546
You fuckin' asshole.

42:00.919 --> 42:01.985
- You love me?

42:08.894 --> 42:10.293
- I lost my work trial today.

42:11.796 --> 42:12.695
You were right.

42:15.333 --> 42:16.666
They just used me.

42:18.703 --> 42:21.037
Go on, laugh.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.873
- It's not funny.

42:25.343 --> 42:30.580
- You always thought it was.

42:33.118 --> 42:34.951
- I was hoping
you'd prove me wrong

42:38.323 --> 42:39.856
because I need you to be right.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.092
I always need you to be right.

42:50.702 --> 42:52.936
- Get some sleep Charlie.

42:52.938 --> 42:53.836
You really need it.

42:55.073 --> 42:56.039
- Can't.

43:03.048 --> 43:03.947
- Just try.

43:13.391 --> 43:15.191
I'll sort things out.

43:30.275 --> 43:32.742
(knocking)

43:35.747 --> 43:36.813
Dr. Pierce.

43:36.815 --> 43:38.047
- [Dr. Pierce] Yes.

43:38.049 --> 43:41.117
- You saw a friend of
mine yesterday, Charlie.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.085
- Ah, yes.

43:44.923 --> 43:46.789
- I'm not here to
defend him or anything.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.791
He can be an idiot
most of the time.

43:50.629 --> 43:52.228
- He was difficult.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.130
- Did you call
welfare or the police?

43:55.233 --> 43:56.799
- I thought you weren't
here to defend him.

43:56.801 --> 44:01.871
- Look, I'm an
ex-zoo-head myself.

44:02.641 --> 44:04.273
I met him back when I was on it.

44:04.275 --> 44:06.943
Under all that bullshit
doctor, he's a good guy.

44:06.945 --> 44:08.444
Seriously.

44:08.446 --> 44:09.946
I know you have to do
what you have to do,

44:09.948 --> 44:13.816
but this, it will ruin his life.

44:13.818 --> 44:17.987
- I appreciate the concern
you have for your friend.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.055
Thanks for stopping by.

44:20.291 --> 44:22.225
- That's it.

44:22.227 --> 44:23.393
- I've got work to do.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.697
- Have you ever signed on?

44:28.433 --> 44:29.365
- Excuse me?

44:30.935 --> 44:33.970
- Have you ever signed on
to unemployment benefits?

44:33.972 --> 44:35.271
- Are you gonna have
a go at me too, now?

44:35.273 --> 44:38.107
- No, I'm just asking
a simple question.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.943
- No, I haven't.

44:40.945 --> 44:42.412
- So you won't be
aware the welfare

44:42.414 --> 44:46.082
holds you by the neck
every single day,

44:46.084 --> 44:48.317
that you're seen as a
scrounger by everyone.

44:48.319 --> 44:50.887
You can't even look at
yourself in the mirror

44:50.889 --> 44:53.756
because you're afraid
to see what they see.

44:54.492 --> 44:57.694
- Is that what you see?

45:01.833 --> 45:05.234
I didn't call the welfare
office of the police.

45:06.404 --> 45:07.737
I realized that it
would have caused

45:07.739 --> 45:08.938
him a lot more trouble.

45:10.008 --> 45:10.907
What's your name?

45:15.313 --> 45:16.212
- Megan.

45:18.450 --> 45:19.982
- I had a son Charlie's age.

45:19.984 --> 45:21.184
He died from zootropics.

45:22.921 --> 45:25.788
I still think he he
got his hands on them

45:28.460 --> 45:30.159
and if I could change things,

45:31.262 --> 45:35.932
my advice to you is
get your friend sober

45:35.934 --> 45:37.200
as quickly as possible.

45:38.203 --> 45:41.337
- Is that why you
work at Infinity?

45:41.339 --> 45:44.173
Hoping to change the past?

45:44.175 --> 45:46.175
- The past can't be changedú.

45:46.177 --> 45:48.478
The perception of
it can, though.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.012
But you don't need
Infinity for that.

45:51.216 --> 45:54.050
- I've heard that Infinity
can create memories, right?

45:54.052 --> 45:56.919
So why not create happy ones?

45:58.223 --> 46:00.923
- Because God doesn't
create perfect lives Megan.

46:00.925 --> 46:03.192
It's suffering that
develops perseverance,

46:03.194 --> 46:07.096
then character,
and finally hope.

46:07.098 --> 46:10.933
Hope to persevere through
suffering full circle.

46:13.171 --> 46:14.270
- Full circle.

46:16.307 --> 46:18.808
- I have some bad news
about Charlie, though.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.010
- What?

46:22.080 --> 46:24.113
- Although I didn't
tell the welfare office,

46:24.115 --> 46:27.917
I can't do the looping if he's
a severe zootropic addict,

46:27.919 --> 46:29.418
it's just too risky.

46:29.420 --> 46:30.820
- If he doesn't do the loop,

46:30.822 --> 46:33.322
welfare will ask and
they'll find out anyway.

46:33.324 --> 46:34.290
- I'm afraid so.

46:39.430 --> 46:40.963
- How much?

46:40.965 --> 46:42.165
- What?

46:42.167 --> 46:45.168
- How much would it
cost to do it anyway?

46:45.170 --> 46:47.236
- That's out of the
question, please leave.

46:47.238 --> 46:48.237
- How much?

46:48.239 --> 46:49.105
- Leave.

46:49.107 --> 46:50.306
- How much?

46:50.308 --> 46:53.810
You may not be able to
change your son's past,

46:53.812 --> 46:56.445
but you can change Charlie's.

47:03.087 --> 47:03.953
Hello?

47:06.624 --> 47:07.523
Guys?

47:18.203 --> 47:20.603
What the hell happened Barton?

47:20.605 --> 47:22.038
- Must have been hungry.

47:22.640 --> 47:23.539
- Come on.

47:25.043 --> 47:25.942
Come on.

47:28.012 --> 47:30.880
- [Barton] Yeah, wouldn't
do that if I were you.

47:30.882 --> 47:33.883
- For fuck's sake Barton, how
long has he been like this?

47:33.885 --> 47:35.251
- Beats me.

47:35.253 --> 47:37.220
I tried moving him but
he just keeps puking.

47:38.923 --> 47:39.889
- What the hell happened?

47:39.891 --> 47:40.656
He could have food poisoning.

47:40.658 --> 47:41.524
Why didn't you do anything?

47:52.270 --> 47:54.103
úOh.

47:54.105 --> 47:55.071
Come on, he has to get dressed.

47:55.073 --> 47:56.639
- Why, does he have a date?

47:56.641 --> 47:59.308
- He needs to go to Infinity.

47:59.310 --> 48:00.376
- What?

48:01.246 --> 48:02.511
- Are you gonna help me or not.

48:03.882 --> 48:05.114
Barton.

48:05.116 --> 48:07.250
- You gotta cut him
off Megs, look at him.

48:07.252 --> 48:08.417
He's dead weight.

48:08.419 --> 48:10.553
You need to do it,
you know you do.

48:11.456 --> 48:12.588
The sooner the better.

48:13.558 --> 48:14.957
A blackhead on your dick grows

48:14.959 --> 48:16.292
into a full grown zit
if you don't squeeze

48:16.294 --> 48:19.562
it out in time and that is pain.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.449
Crucifixion pain.

48:23.450 --> 48:24.699
- Yeah, well I don't
have a dick you moron.

48:29.607 --> 48:32.108
(vomiting)

48:38.416 --> 48:43.052
- Please Megan, Please
Megan, don't make me go.

48:43.054 --> 48:46.722
- It's okay Charlie,
I spoke to them.

48:46.724 --> 48:49.392
- No, this isn't right, please.

48:53.631 --> 48:55.364
- Just hold still.

49:00.371 --> 49:02.204
(dramatic music)

49:02.206 --> 49:03.472
- Get me the fuck out of this.

49:03.474 --> 49:04.540
- [Megan] This is
the only way Charlie.

49:04.542 --> 49:06.175
- Get me out!

49:06.177 --> 49:08.411
- If you don't do this,
welfare will ask questions.

49:08.413 --> 49:09.312
- If they do it, I'll die.

49:09.314 --> 49:10.513
- Calm down Charlie.

49:10.515 --> 49:12.415
- Don't fucking tell
me to calm down.

49:12.417 --> 49:13.716
I've been trying to
tell you something,

49:13.718 --> 49:15.384
something's not right, I've
been trying to tell you.

49:15.386 --> 49:16.652
- That's because you're
zooted up Charlie.

49:16.654 --> 49:17.553
- No.

49:19.991 --> 49:21.257
What the hell is that?

49:21.259 --> 49:22.792
- Something to calm down.

49:22.793 --> 49:24.326
- Listen, if you fucking
touch me, I swear to God

49:24.329 --> 49:27.363
I'll fucking kill you.

49:27.364 --> 49:30.398
No, no, please,
please, please, no, no.

49:33.204 --> 49:37.440
I can't go back, I can't
go back, I can't go back.

49:40.011 --> 49:41.410
- Charlie.

49:41.412 --> 49:43.479
- Please out of everyone
you have to believe me,

49:43.481 --> 49:45.781
He's there Megan, he's
there, he's gonna get me.

49:45.783 --> 49:47.383
- Your dad's dead Charlie.

49:47.385 --> 49:49.352
- Calm down Charlie,
it's only a memory.

49:49.354 --> 49:51.721
It's not real, no
one can hurt you.

49:51.723 --> 49:53.489
- He's there on
the beach, please.

49:53.491 --> 49:56.726
I fucking trusted you, please.

49:56.728 --> 50:00.062
I fucking trusted
you, I trusted you.

50:33.197 --> 50:34.563
- What the hell?

50:40.138 --> 50:41.604
- [Father] Need a fix sweetie?

50:51.816 --> 50:55.518
Well done, sweetie,
he's gonna die again.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.720
(screaming)

50:57.722 --> 50:59.488
- Charlie!

50:59.490 --> 51:00.823
Charlie, wake up.

51:02.126 --> 51:04.326
Charlie, can you hear me.

51:04.328 --> 51:05.561
Charlie wake up!

51:06.497 --> 51:07.496
- Charlie.

51:07.498 --> 51:09.799
- [Father] Very, very real.

51:16.140 --> 51:18.441
- [Dr. Pierce] Charlie,
we're going to pull you out.

51:23.081 --> 51:23.813
- Charlie.

51:26.551 --> 51:27.650
How many did you take?

51:32.490 --> 51:33.823
- You were there.

51:33.825 --> 51:34.757
You were in my head.

51:39.464 --> 51:40.663
Why are you shaking?

51:43.601 --> 51:46.469
You look like
you've been zooting.

51:46.471 --> 51:47.336
- Shut up.

51:49.240 --> 51:52.208
- Meg listen to me,
I'm in the loop.

51:52.210 --> 51:54.276
In the loop and I know you know,

51:54.278 --> 51:55.644
I know you know.

52:03.888 --> 52:04.787
- Charlie!

52:07.225 --> 52:08.124
Charlie!

52:13.731 --> 52:14.630
Charlie!

52:16.501 --> 52:19.301
(dramatic music)

52:29.580 --> 52:30.579
- Why am I in a loop?

52:30.581 --> 52:31.580
You sent me to Infinity,

52:31.582 --> 52:32.598
this has already happened.

52:32.599 --> 52:33.615
They put me in a
loop, I can't get out.

52:33.618 --> 52:34.617
- What?

52:34.619 --> 52:35.851
- How do I get out.

52:35.853 --> 52:38.387
- Wow, you're even more
crazy than I thought.

52:38.389 --> 52:39.722
- Listen to me you prick.

52:39.724 --> 52:41.357
This is a loop.

52:41.359 --> 52:42.591
I don't what game you
and Infinity are playing,

52:42.593 --> 52:44.326
but if you don't get me
help, I swear to God.

52:44.328 --> 52:45.361
- You little shit.

52:45.363 --> 52:46.595
- How did you get in my head?

52:46.597 --> 52:48.564
Answer me, what are
you and Infinity doing?

52:48.566 --> 52:52.168
- It's all over for
you now Charlie mate.

52:52.170 --> 52:55.604
We've been waiting a long,
long time for you to crack.

53:00.645 --> 53:03.379
(evil laughing)

53:05.383 --> 53:07.950
(door slamming)

53:09.287 --> 53:10.686
- The meat's gone bad.

53:15.560 --> 53:16.559
- Wait, wait, wait.

53:16.561 --> 53:18.144
- Fuck.

53:18.145 --> 53:19.728
- Wait, wait, I'm in
a loop, I'm in a loop.

53:19.730 --> 53:20.729
- What?

53:20.731 --> 53:21.797
- In a loop.

53:24.268 --> 53:25.000
Oh, shit.

53:26.470 --> 53:27.870
- Go get a wet cloth, go.

53:29.574 --> 53:32.608
- He's there, he's there.

53:38.749 --> 53:39.782
- Barton, Barton.

53:39.784 --> 53:41.684
- You been feeding her?

53:41.686 --> 53:42.685
- What the fuck?

53:42.687 --> 53:43.719
- Look at her, she's zooting.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.588
- Your dad.

53:45.590 --> 53:46.589
- [Charlie] What?

53:46.591 --> 53:47.690
- Your dad, he's there.

53:47.692 --> 53:48.691
He's here.

53:48.693 --> 53:49.625
- You saw my dad.

53:49.627 --> 53:51.560
- Megan, you been zooting?

53:51.562 --> 53:52.561
- Shut up Barton.

53:52.563 --> 53:53.796
- Fine, you explain to me why

53:53.798 --> 53:54.964
she's all zooted out then.

53:55.833 --> 53:57.399
- I'm in his head.

53:57.401 --> 53:59.768
Your memories, I seen them.

53:59.770 --> 54:03.539
Breaker's Beach, the
sand castle, the bear.

54:03.541 --> 54:04.473
I see it.

54:10.281 --> 54:12.948
(dramatic music)

54:14.552 --> 54:16.051
That shouldn't be there,
that shouldn't be there.

54:17.822 --> 54:19.488
- What the fuck is going on?

54:21.792 --> 54:23.459
- It's Infinity.

54:23.461 --> 54:24.960
They did something to me,

54:24.962 --> 54:25.961
now they're doing
something to her.

54:25.963 --> 54:26.962
- Infinity.

54:26.964 --> 54:28.764
You've both been to Infinity?

54:29.634 --> 54:31.033
- Not this time around.

54:31.035 --> 54:32.768
Not yet.

54:32.770 --> 54:33.836
Right Megan?

54:36.007 --> 54:37.473
We need to get into Infinity,

54:37.475 --> 54:39.508
you need to see what's
going on in my head.

54:41.012 --> 54:43.379
Barton, I need your help.

54:43.381 --> 54:44.847
She needs your help.

54:44.849 --> 54:47.916
You can get us in,
you intern there.

54:50.755 --> 54:53.722
(dramatic music)

55:09.774 --> 55:12.675
- Good thing I'm always
here to bail you out.

55:12.677 --> 55:13.575
- Come on.

55:42.807 --> 55:43.839
(computer keys clicking)

55:43.841 --> 55:45.607
- Get your ass in there.

56:14.171 --> 56:15.471
- What are you doing?

56:16.474 --> 56:17.906
- Scanning.

56:29.854 --> 56:34.923
- Bart.

56:35.726 --> 56:36.625
Barton.

56:38.629 --> 56:39.528
- Something must be wrong.

56:43.401 --> 56:46.502
- Oh, fuck.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.177
- How the fuck
are you in a loop?

56:55.179 --> 56:56.545
- That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

56:56.547 --> 56:57.179
- You have to do
something to get him

56:57.181 --> 56:58.514
out of this Barton.

56:58.516 --> 56:59.715
- Why me?

56:59.717 --> 57:01.016
- What, you want me to beg?

57:01.018 --> 57:02.418
- 'Cause you're the one
who knows Infinity's stuff.

57:02.420 --> 57:04.019
- I was just a used
and abused intern.

57:04.021 --> 57:06.455
- Screw that, you know
this shit inside out.

57:07.992 --> 57:10.092
- Well, wouldn't
hurt if you begged.

57:10.094 --> 57:11.093
- Barton.

57:11.095 --> 57:12.094
- All right, all right.

57:12.096 --> 57:13.529
Chill.

57:13.531 --> 57:16.899
Good news is that you
won't actually die.

57:16.901 --> 57:19.902
Your real body's at
some future point

57:19.904 --> 57:21.003
outside of this memory.

57:21.005 --> 57:24.506
I'm guessing lying
there knocked out,

57:24.508 --> 57:26.708
hooked up like this,
you die in a loop,

57:26.710 --> 57:29.178
it just restarts.

57:29.180 --> 57:30.712
- What's the bad news.

57:30.714 --> 57:32.047
- There's no way out of it.

57:33.017 --> 57:34.583
- What?

57:34.585 --> 57:35.884
- All control is
at the future point

57:35.886 --> 57:38.053
outside of this loop,

57:38.055 --> 57:39.822
so only they can pull the plug.

57:41.859 --> 57:43.158
- Pierce.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.561
That's why I've been
hearing Pierce's voice.

57:45.563 --> 57:46.795
- Huh?

57:46.797 --> 57:48.497
- I think Pierce, the
doctor who did this,

57:48.499 --> 57:49.531
had been trying to
reach out to me.

57:49.533 --> 57:50.699
A future Pierce.

57:50.701 --> 57:53.035
- Yeah, that or
you're hearing things.

57:53.037 --> 57:54.970
You're still a
Zoo-Head, remember.

57:57.074 --> 58:00.042
- But why am I
reliving his memories?

58:00.044 --> 58:02.511
Am in in a loop?

58:02.513 --> 58:04.012
- Doubt it.

58:04.014 --> 58:06.014
Could be something
else entirely.

58:06.016 --> 58:11.086
A shared dream, telepathy,
heightened kundalini,

58:12.156 --> 58:15.724
evolutionary step in
Christ's consciousness.

58:15.726 --> 58:17.926
Or zoots.

58:19.263 --> 58:20.963
- I'm not zooting you asshole.

58:20.965 --> 58:22.798
- We need to figure out a
way to get me out of this.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.199
I'm the reason she's like this.

58:28.839 --> 58:30.272
- There is one way.

58:30.274 --> 58:31.673
- What?

58:31.675 --> 58:32.641
- Loophole theory.

58:33.944 --> 58:36.144
Every time a loop ends,
there's a small intermission,

58:36.146 --> 58:39.147
a breaker, before the
next round loop starts.

58:39.149 --> 58:41.750
We call this a loophole.

58:41.752 --> 58:42.684
- And?

58:42.686 --> 58:44.152
- Okay, try to stay with me.

58:44.154 --> 58:47.523
If genius here can
catch his loophole,

58:47.525 --> 58:48.690
he can use it to jump out,

58:48.692 --> 58:50.726
but that's like
getting a hole in one.

58:50.728 --> 58:52.327
Like an after death experience,

58:52.329 --> 58:55.063
like fucking seeing
heaven and shit,

58:55.065 --> 58:57.299
which is actually just a
rush of oxygen to your brain

58:57.301 --> 58:59.968
causing you to get high
and see Hindu cows.

58:59.970 --> 59:01.803
- Okay, what happens
if I don't catch it?

59:01.805 --> 59:05.741
- I'm not really
sure, thus a theory.

59:05.743 --> 59:08.010
The next round of
loop could be altered.

59:08.012 --> 59:12.114
A lot based on how
fucked up your memory is.

59:12.116 --> 59:16.618
Or your real future
self could die.

59:18.188 --> 59:20.022
- Die?

59:20.024 --> 59:21.156
- Yeah, tragic right.

59:22.126 --> 59:23.825
- This means I have
to wait for this run

59:23.827 --> 59:25.994
of the loop to end and it
always ends with me dying.

59:27.965 --> 59:28.997
- So?

59:28.999 --> 59:30.065
We wait.

59:32.069 --> 59:32.935
- No.

59:34.872 --> 59:35.771
- No?

59:36.740 --> 59:38.006
- [Charlie] We'll do it.

59:40.678 --> 59:43.245
- The loop, are you kidding me?

59:50.821 --> 59:52.588
Well, I'm gonna
need some of this.

59:56.393 --> 59:57.292
- Help.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.264
- [Father] Charlie.

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:03.765
- [Dr. Pierce] Charlie,
Charlie, can you hear me?

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.108
- Charlie.

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:21.950
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:22.851
- What is it?

01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:27.956
- I was saving my
welfare benefits

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:31.393
to get a memory reconstruction
done at Infinity.

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:32.294
- What?

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:36.198
- Zoot's messed me up, Charlie.ú

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.166
They messed me up real bad.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:40.435
- No memories.

01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:44.873
- Charlie.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.880
What if I've already
been to Infinity.

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:53.148
What if they really
messed up and

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.217
gave me your memories?

01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:56.151
I don't know.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.185
- It's possible.

01:00:57.187 --> 01:01:01.323
Or, you could have had
memory reconstruction

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.125
in one of Chuck's previous loops

01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:05.027
and you're just feeling
the effects now,

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:10.098
like ripples in water,
or parallel realities.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:15.303
Each one of Chuck's loops
is a parallel reality.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:17.839
That's pretty fucked up
if you think about it.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.943
But hey, not just what I think.

01:01:21.945 --> 01:01:24.746
This could all be
a Greek tragedy.

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.216
Curtain up in two.

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:35.323
- Charlie, are you sure
you want to do this?

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:39.695
- I'm sorry Megan.

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:42.964
For everything I messed up.

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:48.036
- Charlie, you went to Infinity.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.338
You wanted to get better.

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.940
- No, I didn't.

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:55.343
I just wanted to bury
it all, forget it all.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:04.019
- Your memories,
they're everything.

01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:07.289
- What if they
weren't mine Megan?

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:09.391
I mean who knows
what Infinity can do?

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:12.427
- Relax, it's okay.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:15.964
You know, maybe we are.

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:20.936
I couldn't get you
out my mind anyway.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:25.340
- I like having you in mine.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:34.449
(Barton clearing throat)

01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:45.961
- [Barton] Stewardess,
what's the inflight

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:46.795
movie this evening?

01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:48.063
- [Megan] Shut up.

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:49.297
- [Barton] Chuck, this
may sting a little.

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:50.565
Hold on to your nuts.

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:52.567
Any last words?

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:59.307
(water flowing)

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:04.179
- Charlie.

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:08.183
Charlie, we're trying
to get you out of here.

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:10.585
(baby crying)

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:19.127
- [Father] Your mother
didn't want you.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.029
- She's not my mother.

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:27.002
(Charlie screaming)

01:03:27.004 --> 01:03:28.003
- He's rejecting the loop.

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:29.037
- Come on, do something.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:30.238
- Shut up.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.473
- [Megan] Charlie, don't
be afraid, Charlie.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:34.543
(Charlie screaming)

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:36.344
- Barton.

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:38.547
Charlie.

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:41.082
Charlie.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:42.818
Charlie.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:04:59.294
- Megan.

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:04.966
Megan, wake up.

01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:18.980
Megan.

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:19.714
Megan.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:30.091
(vomiting)

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:41.069
I have no idea what's
happening, but I'll fix it.

01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:43.638
For once in my life I'll fix it.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.349
- Give them to me Charlie.

01:05:56.353 --> 01:05:57.552
(Megan screaming)

01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:58.954
Give them to me.

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:23.211
- Pierce.

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:25.146
- Can I help you?

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.047
- Barton?

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.749
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:29.317
- I work here.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.552
Who are you?

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:32.320
- Who am I, what
the fuck is this?

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.555
- Do you have an appointment.

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:34.990
- Barton, stop.

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:36.491
- Please don't make a
scene and just leave.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:37.592
- Have you seen Megan,

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:39.527
have you seen what
she's been up to?

01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:43.498
She's zooting Barton,
she's zooting.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.432
- If you don't pack up
your stuff and leave,

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:45.400
I am gonna call the police.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:47.469
- What?

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.573
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:57.012
Shit.

01:06:57.014 --> 01:06:57.746
Oh, God.

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:05.687
Parallel reality,
all this has to be.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:10.291
- Okay, I'm calling the police.

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:11.393
- No, no, we live together.

01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:12.660
You pay my rent.

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:14.362
You tell me about the
father all the time,

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:15.730
about my memory at
Breaker's Beach.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:18.566
- Breaker's Beach.

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:19.634
- Yeah.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.437
- Which memory?

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:23.805
- Of my father.

01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:26.341
He used to beat
the shit out of me.

01:07:26.343 --> 01:07:28.710
The sandcastle, the teddy bear.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:29.544
- How the hell do you know that.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.046
- It's my own memory.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:32.047
- No, it is not.

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:33.281
- Of course it is.

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:34.516
- No, it's not,
that's my memory.

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:35.316
I've never told
anybody about what

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:36.117
my father did to me.

01:07:37.788 --> 01:07:38.686
- What?

01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:44.359
Here, she's over here.

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:52.100
Barton.

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:09.684
Barton.

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:12.720
Barton.

01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:23.465
Jesus.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:25.767
Megan, Megan.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:30.839
- Oh, she's cut
herself really bad.

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:34.274
Move, move, move.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:42.183
She needs to get to
the hospital now.

01:08:49.192 --> 01:08:50.191
- You shouldn't have
taken my zoots Charlie.

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:51.593
- It's gonna be okay.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:54.662
- [Megan] It doesn't
matter Charlie.

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:55.729
- Don't say that.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.698
- It doesn't.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:59.868
I was my dad's punching bag.

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.669
Had it coming.

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:02.871
- What?

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.706
- Breaker's Beach.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.174
- That's my memory Megan.

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:09.210
- Who's been zooting now.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.580
- This can't be happening.

01:09:15.218 --> 01:09:16.551
Where'd you get this?

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.223
The dress, tell me, tell me.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:26.161
- Your mom gave it to me.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.662
- I never knew my mother.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:29.863
- Yes, you did.

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:34.602
- Megan.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:37.337
Megan.

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.185
- Charlies, she's.

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:51.786
- Megan.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:53.888
Megan.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:02.297
- [Father] You
fucking little shit.

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:06.234
Look at me, look at me.

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:09.737
I'll fucking kill you.

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:17.879
(Charlie screaming)

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:25.954
- I'll fucking kill you.

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:29.791
I'm not afraid of you.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.760
I'm not afraid of you.

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:36.331
- [Father] Be careful
what you see, son.

01:11:56.713 --> 01:11:59.614
- [Dr. Pierce]
Charlie, it's okay.

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:10.425
You can come out now.

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:41.789
- Am I dead.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.458
- [Dr. Pierce] No, far from it.

01:12:44.394 --> 01:12:45.126
How do you feel?

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:47.462
- Fine.

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.397
Like I've never zooted.

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:52.900
- It worked.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:56.671
Drug rehabilitation is a
form of redemption Charlie.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.606
- You're trying to tell me this

01:12:58.608 --> 01:12:59.440
was all part of the program.

01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:00.708
- Yes.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.610
- But you kept trying
to reach out to me.

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:04.912
Like something wasn't right.

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:09.050
- A guide to reassure
you, to keep you going.

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:10.385
- No, no, Megan died.

01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:12.019
Barton worked at Infinity,

01:13:12.021 --> 01:13:13.755
they had my memory like
something wasn't right.

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:17.425
- We had such a hard
time with your loop

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:18.860
because of your
memory corruption.

01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:22.029
We had to create a
part of your memory.

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:23.131
- Create?

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:24.198
- Charlie!

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:32.006
Don't listen to him.

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:35.109
Chuck, it's me your pal.

01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:37.044
Don't listen to him.

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:40.448
Infinity are trying
to fuck us over.

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:43.484
They all are,
welfare, everybody.

01:13:43.486 --> 01:13:46.954
- Sorry Charlie, we had to
create a part of your memory.

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:50.024
Otherwise your looping
would have crashed.

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:51.859
Barton, Megan.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:53.694
- Don't listen to him.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:54.595
- Don't exist?

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:57.098
Never did?

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:04.639
I have no idea what's
real or not anymore.

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:05.973
- Your dreams are real.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.710
The child abuse you
suppressed is real.

01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:11.646
You needed to confront that.

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:14.782
- Chuck, you know what's real.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:18.453
You're real, Megan's real.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:20.488
I'm fucking real.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.057
- Barton and Megan
were just parts

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:25.460
of your psyche battling
to keep you grounded.

01:14:26.196 --> 01:14:27.795
- Shut up.

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:29.897
- So what happens
when I wake up?

01:14:29.899 --> 01:14:31.499
- You completed the program.

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.167
It's time to pull you out.

01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:43.244
- Charlie?

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:46.881
Charlie!

01:14:54.057 --> 01:14:54.956
- Megan.

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:57.525
- Do I know you?

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.530
- I'm Charlie.

01:15:02.532 --> 01:15:03.264
- Megan.

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:08.102
It's beautiful here, right?

01:15:10.306 --> 01:15:11.205
- Yeah.

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:14.075
- Are you from around here?

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:17.245
Have you been to the
restaurant up there?

01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:18.145
- The restaurant?

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:19.213
- Yeah.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:22.283
I own the little
restaurant up by the beach.

01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:24.018
- You do, wow.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.119
- Yeah, living the dream.

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.556
You should pop by for a drink.

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:34.128
Oh.

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:36.898
I found this.

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:40.635
Must have been some
kid who left it here.

01:15:41.571 --> 01:15:43.538
You know what, you can have it.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:48.242
See you later.

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:20.841
(exhaling)

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:32.353
(funky technological music)
