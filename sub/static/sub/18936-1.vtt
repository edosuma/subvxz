00:35.562 --> 00:38.941
We will not be able to go anywhere

00:40.275 --> 00:43.070
There is no route from here.

00:45.155 --> 00:48.659
This journey was hopeless.

00:49.910 --> 00:50.869
We can only go this far.

00:51.745 --> 00:53.413
Let's give up.

00:56.959 --> 00:58.001
There is a way.

00:58.585 --> 00:59.670
Let's believe in it.

01:00.629 --> 01:01.713
We will surely be able to find it.

01:02.548 --> 01:03.841
But, Princess...

01:04.800 --> 01:05.592
Don't give up!

01:07.052 --> 01:07.719
Princess...

01:11.682 --> 01:12.933
Princess Fuun!

01:13.350 --> 01:16.144
You bastards will not be able
to go any further than this.

01:16.937 --> 01:17.855
Mao!

01:17.938 --> 01:18.689
You bastrad!

01:18.730 --> 01:20.065
Don't tell me that you're the one who caused this storm!

01:23.610 --> 01:24.862
Watch out, Princess Fuun!

01:40.419 --> 01:41.712
You should give up.

01:42.212 --> 01:44.923
You should beg for forgiveness, Princess Fuun.

01:45.841 --> 01:47.009
I will never give up.

01:48.302 --> 01:49.720
As long as I live,

01:50.470 --> 01:52.097
I will turn everything that I have into strength,

01:52.848 --> 01:54.808
and I will show that I can cut a way open!

01:56.935 --> 01:57.603
The princess is...

01:57.811 --> 01:59.688
The seven color chakra is burning.

02:00.272 --> 02:02.774
Let's go! We shall also burn our chakra!

02:02.983 --> 02:03.483
Yes!

02:03.775 --> 02:04.568
Alright!

02:45.275 --> 02:46.985
Alright!

02:47.861 --> 02:49.321
That's the way, well done, Princess Fuun!

02:49.488 --> 02:52.658
As I thought, justice will always triumph!

02:53.033 --> 02:55.619
Hey! What are you doing up there?!

02:57.329 --> 02:58.163
Ow ow ow ow ow! Geez!

02:58.747 --> 03:00.123
What do you want all of a sudden?

03:01.083 --> 03:02.334
What do you mean what do I want?

03:02.543 --> 03:05.254
Sneaking in and watching the movie
for free is completely unethical.

03:05.504 --> 03:06.922
No, it's not like that.

03:07.339 --> 03:10.175
We weren't just watching the movie,
we were training at the same time.

03:10.634 --> 03:11.343
Training?

03:12.845 --> 03:13.887
Our tickets are right here.

03:16.223 --> 03:18.016
Are you guys Konoha ninja?

03:18.183 --> 03:19.768
Heh, that's right!

03:19.935 --> 03:25.357
I will one day be the super ninja to claim the
Hokage name, Uzumaki Naruto-sama!

03:25.399 --> 03:26.275
I am...

03:26.817 --> 03:27.484
You're noisy!

03:28.068 --> 03:29.403
Be considerate!

03:30.070 --> 03:31.154
Shut up!

03:32.155 --> 03:33.866
Well then, let's go...

03:35.117 --> 03:36.618
... beyond that rainbow!

03:41.248 --> 03:45.794
NARUTO

03:45.794 --> 03:53.010
NARUTO
The Big Mission to Rescue the Snow Princess!

03:57.097 --> 04:01.143
(On poster: The Adventures of Princess Fuun)

04:05.397 --> 04:07.316
Kakashi-sensei sure is late.

04:07.941 --> 04:09.026
It's always like this.

04:10.152 --> 04:13.030
Geez, that movie was so good.

04:13.780 --> 04:16.491
I was so overwhelmed by it.

04:16.742 --> 04:17.826
What are you saying?!

04:18.076 --> 04:21.370
Because you created such an uproar,
we didn't get to watch the end.

04:21.538 --> 04:24.041
(On door: Entrance Prohibited)

04:24.082 --> 04:29.713
Oh well, I should have atched Michi-sama, the
guy who played Tsukuyaku, more carefully.

04:31.340 --> 04:34.510
Ah, but of course, you're number one, Sasuke-kun.

04:34.968 --> 04:38.055
Sakura-chan has bad taste in men, as always.

04:38.347 --> 04:39.598
What did you say?!

04:40.432 --> 04:41.600
No, nothing really.

04:42.142 --> 04:42.601
Oh really?

04:52.110 --> 04:56.823
I wonder if there are any princesses like Princess Fuun around here.

04:58.325 --> 05:02.788
Any ninja would be satisfied to fight for a princess like that.

05:03.914 --> 05:04.915
What nonsense.

05:05.082 --> 05:06.667
It's just a story from a movie.

05:09.586 --> 05:15.425
But then, I wonder why Kakashi-sensei told
us to watch this movie before the mission.

05:31.650 --> 05:33.569
No way! Princess Fuun!

06:28.582 --> 06:29.458
Follow her!

06:31.168 --> 06:32.294
Don't let her get way!

06:33.086 --> 06:35.923
I will protect Princess Fuun!

06:50.062 --> 06:50.521
Now!

07:00.364 --> 07:01.823
We finally caught you.

07:08.205 --> 07:09.039
Who are you, bastard?

07:32.896 --> 07:33.981
Oh my, my.

07:36.108 --> 07:37.109
Kakashi-sensei!

07:37.860 --> 07:39.403
What are you guys doing?

07:40.445 --> 07:41.405
Just wasting time.

07:48.704 --> 07:50.289
I'm sorry.

07:51.165 --> 07:51.582
What?

07:52.624 --> 07:55.335
This person is the client for this mission.

08:12.394 --> 08:14.646
Are you hurt, Princess?

08:20.027 --> 08:24.364
Oh wow, you really are Princess Fuun!

08:24.907 --> 08:29.745
You know, when I watched your movie, I was so moved!

08:30.871 --> 08:31.914
"Don't give up."

08:32.414 --> 08:35.501
I was about to cry until I couldn't stop.

08:48.055 --> 08:52.184
When I saw your movie, I was motivated.

08:57.731 --> 08:58.941
I won't ever give up.

08:59.525 --> 09:02.569
I will try harder, and I'll become Hokage.

09:03.028 --> 09:07.366
Ah, by the way, the Hokage is the ninja in the village of Konoha.

09:08.283 --> 09:10.786
You're really good at riding.

09:11.411 --> 09:16.208
As expected from the Fire Country's most famous actress!

09:27.469 --> 09:29.847
Hey, miss, you're going a bit too fast!

09:34.643 --> 09:35.227
Watch out!

09:40.774 --> 09:42.276
It's Princess Fuun!

09:44.278 --> 09:46.238
Wow! Great!

09:46.280 --> 09:48.240
It's really Princess Fuun!

09:48.532 --> 09:50.367
I am not Princess Fuun.

09:50.742 --> 09:53.662
I know, you are the actress Fujikaze Yukie.

09:53.871 --> 09:55.497
I'm a fan of yours!

09:56.957 --> 09:58.000
Please sign!

09:59.168 --> 10:00.419
Me too!

10:00.460 --> 10:02.171
I don't give autographs or anything like that.

10:02.212 --> 10:04.631
Please don't say that, please?

10:04.756 --> 10:06.175
Please sign.

10:06.341 --> 10:07.676
Me too! Give me an autograph!

10:07.718 --> 10:11.471
Since you're an actress, please at least give me an autograph!

10:11.763 --> 10:12.639
Cut it out!

10:14.057 --> 10:16.935
What's so fun about getting my autograph?

10:18.395 --> 10:23.483
Sooner or later, you will put it away somewhere
and then it will collect dust.

10:24.443 --> 10:27.070
It doesn't serve a purpose and it's useless.

10:27.988 --> 10:28.488
It's so stupid.

10:31.158 --> 10:32.910
That's so rude of her.

10:33.410 --> 10:34.786
Oh my, that's so disappointing.

10:35.078 --> 10:37.414
Just because she's making it big doesn't
mean that she can be bitchy.

10:39.833 --> 10:45.839
This time, our mission is to protect the actress
that plays Princess Fuun, Fukikaze Yukie.

10:47.132 --> 10:47.925
Protect?

10:48.425 --> 10:51.929
Well, protect may not be the right word.
It's better to say we're her escorts.

10:52.971 --> 10:56.183
This will be the first time that The Unlucky
Princess will be filmed overseas.

10:57.017 --> 11:00.479
But Fujikaze Yukie plays the most critical role.

11:00.938 --> 11:02.606
I am really sorry...

11:03.524 --> 11:06.485
As one would expect from Konoha ninja...

11:07.319 --> 11:10.072
...the bodyguards that were hired as stuntmen,

11:10.113 --> 11:14.117
and even our master guards were easily beaten.

11:14.701 --> 11:17.037
Thank you very much for you compliment.

11:24.586 --> 11:26.839
Wow, what beautiful cliffs.

11:27.714 --> 11:30.926
Those are the Snow Country's rainbow glaciers.

11:32.344 --> 11:33.971
You're Kin-chan, the actor who played Brit!

11:34.847 --> 11:38.183
This time, the last scene of the movie will be fimed there.

11:38.642 --> 11:40.435
And you're Hideo-san, the actor who played Shishimaru!

11:41.770 --> 11:44.690
We sure are going far if we're going to the Snow Country.

11:45.732 --> 11:49.069
That was the manager, Sandayuu-san's, recommendation.

11:50.112 --> 11:54.491
It is said that in Spring the rainbow glaciers glow with seven colors.

11:55.117 --> 11:57.244
But that is nothing more than a myth.

11:58.412 --> 12:00.831
In the real Snow Country, there is no such thing as Spring.

12:01.582 --> 12:02.291
No Spring?

12:02.791 --> 12:04.501
Does that mean that it's always winter?

12:05.127 --> 12:06.420
That's what it mean.

12:07.171 --> 12:08.630
Kakashi, was it?

12:09.006 --> 12:13.260
I heard that you'd been to the Snow Country before.

12:14.261 --> 12:15.679
It was long ago.

12:17.973 --> 12:20.976
And it is said that the Snow Country is a poor nation.

12:24.354 --> 12:28.233
It-It's the henchman, Michi-sama!

12:28.609 --> 12:31.695
Didn't their economy collapse because the previous feudal
lord got too involved with his mechanical puppets?

12:32.321 --> 12:36.617
And that's how they went bankrupt, or something like that?

12:37.075 --> 12:39.661
Hey, I hope that they have a heater at least.

12:40.204 --> 12:42.372
I don't really like to go to cold places.

12:42.789 --> 12:45.709
So, do you wanna run away, just like Yukie?

12:46.043 --> 12:49.087
Hey, give me a break!

12:51.048 --> 12:55.552
Is Yukie-san, erm... always like that?

12:58.639 --> 12:59.640
Well, yes.

13:00.307 --> 13:02.935
She doesn't know the meaning of words like "motivation" or "ambition",

13:03.352 --> 13:05.521
and she is really quite helpless, that Yukie-chan...

13:06.563 --> 13:09.608
But she doesn't slack off when it comes to work.

13:11.151 --> 13:13.654
I don't care about an actor's private life.

13:14.488 --> 13:18.534
As long as she gives a great performance when
the camera is on, I'm not going to complain.

13:19.993 --> 13:22.287
She was born to be an actress.

13:22.913 --> 13:28.794
Thinking about it, she started running away when she
was told that she was going to the Snow Country.

14:29.062 --> 14:30.355
Okay, I give up.

14:31.815 --> 14:32.816
Alright!

14:36.528 --> 14:37.362
Your name is?

14:38.071 --> 14:39.323
Uzumaki Naruto!

14:39.531 --> 14:41.909
Yeah, yeah... Uzumaki Naruto-san, right?

14:44.286 --> 14:46.955
Miss, you smell nice.

14:56.715 --> 14:57.508
What was that?!

14:57.799 --> 14:59.510
Pervert repellent.

15:17.528 --> 15:18.529
How stupid.

15:36.421 --> 15:37.756
Quit joking around.

15:38.131 --> 15:39.675
Who would want to go to the Snow Country?

16:09.454 --> 16:11.707
I finally found you, Princess Fuun!

16:13.750 --> 16:16.879
I told you already, I'm not Princess Fuun.

16:18.088 --> 16:20.048
I understand that!

16:20.340 --> 16:23.677
How dare you break a boy's pure heart?!

16:24.178 --> 16:29.016
It doesn't matter how great of an actress
you are, I will never forgive you!

16:32.311 --> 16:33.312
Actress?

16:33.896 --> 16:34.771
Great?

16:43.822 --> 16:45.115
How stupid.

16:47.492 --> 16:49.745
Being an actress is the worst job ever.

16:50.954 --> 16:53.373
It's a job for the worst people.

16:58.003 --> 17:02.633
You have to follow other people's scripts,
act, and live in a world packed with lies.

17:04.009 --> 17:05.135
Truly stupid.

17:06.011 --> 17:07.846
Lady, are you drunk?

17:08.888 --> 17:10.891
You're annoying, hurry up and disappear!

17:17.271 --> 17:18.232
Yukie-sama!

17:19.816 --> 17:22.611
The ship to the Snow Country is departing soon!

17:23.237 --> 17:24.738
We'd better hurry, or else...

17:25.531 --> 17:26.531
It's okay.

17:28.282 --> 17:29.827
I am not going to board.

17:30.035 --> 17:31.495
Eh? What?!

17:31.954 --> 17:33.497
What are you saying?!

17:34.039 --> 17:34.957
It'll be alright.

17:35.916 --> 17:36.959
It happens all the time.

17:38.460 --> 17:42.840
Something goes wrong, the main character
gets replaced, the director gets replaced...

17:43.090 --> 17:43.841
Be quiet!

17:44.842 --> 17:50.556
The part of Princess Fuun can only be played by you!

17:56.395 --> 18:01.400
And if you aren't going to come, you are not going
to be able to work in this business again.

18:02.234 --> 18:04.361
It's alright, it doesn't matter.

18:05.070 --> 18:05.904
Yukie-sama.

18:07.948 --> 18:09.283
I guess it can't be helped.

18:31.054 --> 18:34.850
I see. So she has the hexagonal crystal.

18:37.895 --> 18:43.400
The actress Fujikaze Yukie is undoubtedly Kazahana Koyuki.

18:44.067 --> 18:47.821
Ten years of searching is finally paying off.

18:50.866 --> 18:53.035
If it was just the girl, it would be too easy.

18:54.703 --> 18:58.790
But Koyuki seems o have an escort, Hatake Kakashi.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.709
Hatake Kakashi?

19:01.043 --> 19:03.337
Eh? That sounds interesting.

19:03.921 --> 19:05.923
Sounds like fate has spurred this confrontation.

19:25.275 --> 19:27.945
Father, were are you?

19:29.112 --> 19:29.905
Father?

19:34.743 --> 19:35.577
Father?

19:38.413 --> 19:39.331
Koyuki?

19:39.915 --> 19:40.374
Come here.

19:44.253 --> 19:46.380
Yes, stand right there.

19:47.631 --> 19:48.298
What can you see there?

19:49.132 --> 19:51.176
Father and me.

19:53.011 --> 19:54.054
Look carefully.

19:55.430 --> 19:56.640
You will be able to see your future.

20:25.294 --> 20:27.337
Are you awake, Yukie-san?

20:28.088 --> 20:30.174
Sandaiyuu, can you bring me water?

20:31.508 --> 20:32.968
My head feels like it's spinning.

20:34.595 --> 20:36.930
I think I may be hallucinating, but it feels like I'm swaying.

20:37.973 --> 20:39.892
No, it's not your imagination.

20:40.809 --> 20:41.268
Eh?

20:45.230 --> 20:47.024
What the hell is this?!

21:00.078 --> 21:03.123
I don't like that lady.

21:03.707 --> 21:05.125
What are you saying, Naruto?

21:05.626 --> 21:08.003
Whatever happens, we have to protect her.

21:09.379 --> 21:11.173
This is an important mission.
(On book: Come Come Paradise)

21:11.840 --> 21:12.591
Mission?

21:13.008 --> 21:14.843
That's right, it's an A-Rank mission.

21:15.385 --> 21:16.678
A-Rank mission?

21:17.596 --> 21:21.808
I don't think it will be that hard just to protect a single actress.

21:22.518 --> 21:24.228
That's not true, Sasuke.

21:24.728 --> 21:27.314
That's because famous people always get targeted.

21:27.814 --> 21:31.693
And we don't know who the enemies are,
so don't let your guard down.

21:35.864 --> 21:37.908
Lights okay, mic okay.

21:38.283 --> 21:39.201
Cameras okay.

21:39.827 --> 21:41.745
Put in your best effort!

21:42.162 --> 21:43.831
Start it from the test!

21:44.164 --> 21:44.790
Yes!

21:45.040 --> 21:49.002
Alright, scene 23, cut 6, take 1, action!

21:54.800 --> 21:56.885
Shishimaru, hang in there!

21:58.095 --> 22:03.725
Your Highness... I'm sorry to be of no use...

22:04.768 --> 22:05.853
What are you saying?

22:06.395 --> 22:10.607
Because of you, and the courage you gave us...

22:11.859 --> 22:12.734
Your Highness...

22:13.694 --> 22:17.906
I wanted to see the other side of the rainbow together with you...

22:20.409 --> 22:21.160
Shishimaru...

22:22.744 --> 22:23.871
What great drama...

22:24.204 --> 22:27.416
That's entirely different from how she acts in real life...

22:28.458 --> 22:30.085
That is Yukie-sama.

22:31.837 --> 22:37.176
As soon as the camera starts rolling, there
isn't anyone who can act like her!

22:42.764 --> 22:43.640
Okay, stop.

22:45.309 --> 22:46.560
What is it?!

22:46.894 --> 22:48.645
Sandaiyuu, I need the eye drops.

22:48.729 --> 22:49.438
The eye drops.

22:50.939 --> 22:51.940
Yes, yes, yes.

22:58.113 --> 22:58.780
Good enough?

22:59.406 --> 23:00.491
It is going to overflow!

23:00.532 --> 23:01.617
Hurry up and get the film rolling!

23:02.117 --> 23:03.535
Geez, we don't have a choice.

23:03.785 --> 23:05.245
Hey, we are going to take it right away.

23:05.370 --> 23:05.621
Yes!

23:06.330 --> 23:09.917
Alright, scene 23, cut 6-2. Action!

23:10.918 --> 23:12.628
Shishimaru!

23:22.763 --> 23:24.431
D-D-Director!

23:24.765 --> 23:25.974
We're in trouble!

23:35.859 --> 23:36.944
This is...

23:37.194 --> 23:40.447
When I woke up this morning, the route was blocked!

23:40.906 --> 23:41.782
What should we do?

23:45.994 --> 23:47.621
We can do it here!

23:47.913 --> 23:48.497
Eh?

23:48.831 --> 23:49.540
You fool!

23:49.998 --> 23:52.292
Can't you see that this is the ideal location?

23:52.668 --> 23:54.711
How can we afford not to film in such a place?!

23:55.254 --> 23:56.004
Eh?!

23:56.255 --> 23:59.508
This is what you call it when the "God of Movies" arrives.

24:00.384 --> 24:02.177
Everyone get ready to land!

24:08.892 --> 24:12.229
We will be filming, so please stand by.

24:13.605 --> 24:17.150
Okay, scene 36, cut 22. Action!

24:20.320 --> 24:21.905
So you have come all the way here!

24:22.197 --> 24:23.031
Princess Fuun!

24:23.615 --> 24:25.033
You are Mao!

24:25.742 --> 24:27.202
Your Highness, please stay back!

24:27.661 --> 24:28.704
We will deal with him!

24:29.788 --> 24:34.418
Whatever your numbers, you are no match for me.

24:38.547 --> 24:39.464
What is the meaning of this?

24:42.801 --> 24:44.219
What are you doing?!

24:44.845 --> 24:45.679
Everyone, get back!

24:53.979 --> 24:56.315
Welcome to the Snow Country.

24:56.940 --> 24:57.649
You are...

25:00.569 --> 25:02.779
I welcome you, Princess Koyuki.

25:03.614 --> 25:05.908
Did you bring the hexagonal crystal?

25:07.826 --> 25:08.994
Princess Koyuki?!

25:17.044 --> 25:18.712
As expected of Hatake Kakashi.

25:19.171 --> 25:20.923
I can't get any closer to you than here.

25:21.507 --> 25:22.591
Sasuke, Naruto, Sakura,

25:23.800 --> 25:25.385
You guys go and protect Yokie-san.

25:26.428 --> 25:27.471
Everyone go and return to the ship!

25:30.307 --> 25:33.310
Fubuki, Mizore, get Princess Koyuki.

25:33.977 --> 25:34.269
Yeah.

25:34.561 --> 25:35.270
Oh well, oh well.

25:39.358 --> 25:40.984
It's been a while, Kakashi.

25:42.027 --> 25:43.320
You're not going to run away this time?

25:44.196 --> 25:45.239
Like last time?

25:46.740 --> 25:48.659
Rouga Nadare.

25:59.920 --> 26:03.590
I don't know exactly what's going on,
but it seems just like the movies!

26:03.966 --> 26:07.511
Princess Fuun! I will protect you!

26:27.155 --> 26:28.657
Hyouton Tsubame Fubuki!
(Ice Element, Swallow Attack)

26:32.452 --> 26:34.037
Katon, Goukakyuu no Jutsu!

26:37.958 --> 26:39.626
Everyone hurry up and return to the ship!

26:41.336 --> 26:41.920
Yukie-san!

26:42.671 --> 26:43.964
Your Highness!

26:46.258 --> 26:47.134
Sandayuu...

26:47.718 --> 26:48.343
You...

26:48.760 --> 26:49.678
Hyouro no Jutsu!
(Ice Prison Technique)

26:59.146 --> 26:59.855
Princess?

27:09.656 --> 27:09.948
Naruto!

27:10.657 --> 27:12.284
Suiton, Suiryuudan no Jutsu!
(Water Element, Water Dragon Blast Technique)

27:20.751 --> 27:22.377
Sacrifice your lives and keep on shooting!

27:22.753 --> 27:24.713
Show pride in our work!

27:26.256 --> 27:26.798
Sensei,

27:27.132 --> 27:28.884
there's something weird about that armor!

27:29.301 --> 27:32.638
That is the Snow Country's armor designed especially for ninja.

27:32.930 --> 27:34.431
It's chakra armor.

27:35.057 --> 27:36.225
Chakra armor?

27:37.309 --> 27:39.895
They are more powerful than before.

27:40.521 --> 27:41.647
You remembered?

27:42.648 --> 27:48.195
This armor increases my chakra and strengthens my techniques.

27:49.154 --> 27:51.949
It creates a wall of chakra around the body.

27:52.407 --> 27:57.329
And it even nullifies your chakra and reflects it back to you.

27:58.121 --> 28:01.124
It doesn't matter what kind of ninjutsu
or genjutsu you use, they won't work.

28:06.630 --> 28:08.131
Hyouton, Haryuu Muuko!
(Ice Element, Piercing Dragon Fierce Tiger)

28:08.841 --> 28:09.967
Suiton, Suiryuudan!
(Ice Element, Piercing Dragon Fierce Tiger)

28:22.896 --> 28:24.857
Get out of the way, little girl!

28:31.363 --> 28:32.865
You brat!

28:38.662 --> 28:40.247
What is this chakra?!

29:07.941 --> 29:08.859
Yukie-san, hurry!

29:09.193 --> 29:10.277
Hurry up and return to the ship!

29:14.031 --> 29:14.656
Your Highness!

29:21.079 --> 29:22.748
Father!

29:23.624 --> 29:24.500
What are you doing?!

29:24.791 --> 29:25.375
Hurry up and go!

29:26.043 --> 29:27.794
Your Highness, let's hurry back to the ship.

29:28.670 --> 29:28.837
No.

29:29.838 --> 29:31.632
We must hurry, or your life will be...

29:31.673 --> 29:32.758
I don't care if I die!

29:34.092 --> 29:34.843
I'm not going!

29:36.136 --> 29:38.013
I'm not going to the Snow Country!

29:38.597 --> 29:40.390
Quit being so selfish!

29:46.104 --> 29:46.855
Get lost!

29:51.401 --> 29:51.860
Sakura-chan!

29:55.489 --> 29:56.073
Your highness!

29:58.450 --> 30:00.410
I told you that you are my opponent!

30:01.620 --> 30:03.705
Hyouton, Itsukaku Hakuegei!
(Ice Element, One Horned Whale)

30:13.382 --> 30:15.843
I see, that's quite a powerful jutsu.

30:17.094 --> 30:17.928
Well then, I'll get serious.

30:18.470 --> 30:20.138
Naruto! Gather everyone and run!

30:22.182 --> 30:23.725
Hyouton, Itsukaku Hakusei!

30:26.728 --> 30:28.063
As usual, you copied it.

30:28.605 --> 30:30.524
You can't beat me with the same jutsu.

30:31.525 --> 30:32.442
Beat you?

30:32.985 --> 30:35.320
I'm sorry, but I won't meet your expectations.

30:36.071 --> 30:36.613
What?

30:54.089 --> 30:55.382
Cut!

30:55.591 --> 30:57.551
Wow, we just filmed a great movie...

31:19.072 --> 31:21.700
It has been ten years since that time...

31:26.705 --> 31:28.248
We've reached the harbor.

31:39.968 --> 31:42.596
Sandayuu-san, you knew about this, right?

31:43.847 --> 31:44.181
Yes.

31:45.098 --> 31:50.312
You must have know how she would
react if she were to return here.

31:51.730 --> 31:57.694
This is the only way that I could bring
the princess back to this country.

31:59.822 --> 32:01.365
Old man Sandayuu!

32:01.698 --> 32:07.746
Princess Fuun is just someone in the movie,
she isn't a real princess.

32:08.372 --> 32:10.165
She is a real princess.

32:11.917 --> 32:14.253
Fujikaze Yukie is a fake name.

32:15.045 --> 32:19.258
She is really Kazahana Koyoki, the heiress of the Snow Country.

32:21.593 --> 32:26.723
The last time I was with her, she was very young.

32:27.891 --> 32:30.644
It's not surprising that she does not remember me.

32:31.270 --> 32:34.231
Sandayuu-san, you're also from the Snow Country?

32:35.190 --> 32:36.024
Yes, that's right.

32:36.525 --> 32:41.697
I used to serve at the side of this country's
previous king, Kazahana Sousetsu-sama.

32:44.324 --> 32:49.246
The Snow Country was a small, but peaceful country.

32:49.246 --> 32:50.998
(On Wall: Snow Mountain)

32:52.583 --> 32:59.840
Sousetsu-sama loved the princess very much
and they lived a very peaceful life.

33:03.302 --> 33:06.263
But ten years ago, that incident...

33:06.680 --> 33:09.391
Sousetsu-sama's younger brother Dotou,

33:09.725 --> 33:15.063
hired some ninja, revolted, and took over this country.

33:19.234 --> 33:26.408
He burnt the beautiful Kazahana Castle, and
we thought that we'd lost the princess.

33:29.578 --> 33:31.997
Don't expose your face! The enemy will find us!

33:36.418 --> 33:40.255
I couldn't win against them at that time. I had to run away.

33:41.715 --> 33:44.301
I had no choice but to run away...

33:45.469 --> 33:47.137
Father!

33:47.763 --> 33:50.724
I found the princess when she was on stage.

33:51.808 --> 33:53.727
I was overjoyed...

33:55.395 --> 33:59.024
...at how she... how she managed to survive...

34:01.527 --> 34:03.237
It would have been better if I had died that day.

34:09.409 --> 34:11.370
Please don't say that.

34:12.161 --> 34:17.292
To us, that fact that you are still alive is our hope!

34:18.126 --> 34:21.170
Even if I am still alive, my heart is already dead.

34:23.757 --> 34:27.219
Ever since that incident, my tears have dried up.

34:32.975 --> 34:36.770
After the incident, I somehow managed
to become Fujikaze Yukie's manager.

34:37.271 --> 34:41.315
And I waited until I finally got the chance
to bring the princess back to this country.

34:42.109 --> 34:45.904
Eh? So all this time, you were using us?

34:46.405 --> 34:51.784
No. Well... I apologize for fooling all of
you, but this is for the Snow Country.

34:55.496 --> 34:56.706
Princess Koyuki!

34:57.040 --> 35:01.378
You must overthrow Dotou, and be our new Queen!

35:04.381 --> 35:08.969
I, Sandayuu, will protect you with my life!

35:10.012 --> 35:13.348
So please fight with us!

35:17.603 --> 35:18.270
No.

35:19.563 --> 35:19.813
Wha..?

35:20.647 --> 35:21.732
Don't joke with me.

35:22.566 --> 35:25.152
But the people of the Snow Country...

35:25.569 --> 35:26.820
That's none of my business.

35:27.237 --> 35:27.821
I refuse.

35:29.156 --> 35:29.948
Your Highness...

35:30.574 --> 35:32.117
Give it up already!

35:32.743 --> 35:33.535
Are you stupid?

35:34.161 --> 35:37.539
No matter how hard you try,
there is no way you can defeat Dotou!

35:41.543 --> 35:44.671
Don't say the words "give up" that easily!

35:45.506 --> 35:49.885
This old man is risking his life to make that dream come true.

35:50.636 --> 35:53.931
If you make fun of him, I'll never forgive you!

35:55.015 --> 35:55.933
Naruto-dono...
(Note:-dono is an honorific used to address samurai)

35:55.933 --> 35:57.851
(Note:-dono is an honorific used to address samurai)

35:58.769 --> 36:00.896
Because you wou,dn't give up, you'll be able to see a dream.

36:01.939 --> 36:04.233
Because you're able to see a dream, the future will come.

36:05.317 --> 36:09.905
This is nice. What a perfect theme for the
final chapter of The Unlucky Princess.

36:10.280 --> 36:15.744
D-Director... don't tell me that you are going to continue filming...

36:16.161 --> 36:18.831
I told you that this movie is changing...

36:19.081 --> 36:20.332
No way!

36:21.041 --> 36:21.792
Think about it.

36:22.876 --> 36:25.462
Using a real princess and making it a movie.

36:25.921 --> 36:28.131
It's something that happens once in a lifetime.

36:29.383 --> 36:33.595
Oh, I see. It's going to be a great success, and
we can film the movie and earn big bucks.

36:34.680 --> 36:37.307
If we do this, it is going to be a real hit!

36:37.349 --> 36:38.058
Wait a second!

36:38.225 --> 36:40.894
Unfortunately, there is only one option left.

36:42.688 --> 36:46.525
There isn't a place where you can hide,
now that Dotou has discovered you.

36:47.734 --> 36:50.529
To fight is the only way for you to live.

36:53.115 --> 36:53.991
Kakashi-sensei...

36:54.533 --> 36:56.910
Okay! The mission will continue!

36:57.411 --> 37:01.081
Princess Fuun will go on to the Snow Country
and defeat the evil commander!

37:01.123 --> 37:01.999
Don't fool around!

37:03.709 --> 37:05.252
Reality is different from the movie.

37:06.044 --> 37:08.797
There is no such thing as a happy ending anywhere in this world!

37:08.839 --> 37:11.717
If you put in the effort, you will be able to pull through!

37:13.635 --> 37:18.765
For such a mission, we should return
to the village and get more people.

37:19.183 --> 37:20.392
That would be a waste of time.

37:20.851 --> 37:23.061
We are enough for this mission.

37:24.563 --> 37:25.689
You all...

37:26.773 --> 37:27.733
So it's decided.

37:28.317 --> 37:29.776
The filming will continue!

37:30.235 --> 37:32.196
Let's make it a movie with a happy ending!

37:32.529 --> 37:33.155
Yeah!

38:02.434 --> 38:07.064
At the other side of this large cave, there is
a village where our comrades are gathered.

38:08.023 --> 38:11.193
After we finish filming here,
we are planning to make a formal visit.

38:12.778 --> 38:17.282
Everyone is waiting for the princess' arrival,
more than tou can possibly know.

38:26.667 --> 38:29.253
I can't see the exit.

38:30.128 --> 38:32.881
Long ago, this place used to be a railway.

38:33.590 --> 38:34.258
Railway?

38:35.217 --> 38:40.514
Right now, it's covered by ice, but
really the tracks are underneath.

38:51.441 --> 38:53.902
Alright! We'll start the filming!

38:54.236 --> 38:57.156
D-Director! Big problem!

38:57.447 --> 38:58.365
What is it this time?

38:59.074 --> 39:00.701
Yukie ran away again!

39:01.034 --> 39:01.785
What?!

39:08.750 --> 39:09.751
Don't fool around...

39:10.878 --> 39:12.004
Don't fool around with me!

39:13.505 --> 39:14.673
We will split up from here to search for her.

39:15.090 --> 39:16.258
If you find her, make contact by radio!

39:16.800 --> 39:17.301
Understood!

39:55.339 --> 39:59.092
Look carefully, you should be able to see your future.

40:03.222 --> 40:04.556
I can't see anything.

40:05.599 --> 40:06.517
You will.

40:07.309 --> 40:09.686
That's right. When Spring comes, you'll be able to see it.

40:10.729 --> 40:11.355
Spring?

40:14.274 --> 40:15.526
Father, you liar.

40:17.069 --> 40:20.322
There is no Spring in this country.

40:31.875 --> 40:36.088
Geez, how many times do you have to
run away before you're satisfied?

40:41.093 --> 40:42.511
Everyone is waiting.

40:48.517 --> 40:53.063
Why is it always you who finds me?

40:53.939 --> 40:55.440
Because it's my mission.

40:56.358 --> 41:00.070
Even if you don't like it, I will chase you wherever you go.

41:03.115 --> 41:06.034
I just know... by your smell.

41:11.290 --> 41:12.166
Go back.

41:13.041 --> 41:15.335
I will just act in front of the camera.

41:17.045 --> 41:18.881
I'm not going to do anything else.

41:36.481 --> 41:37.274
What is it?

41:41.320 --> 41:41.987
It's chakra.

41:42.988 --> 41:46.408
There is a small amount of chakra flowing
through the rail, and it's melting the ice.

41:49.536 --> 41:50.454
They're coming.

41:53.415 --> 41:55.042
Everyone! Hurry up and run away!

41:55.459 --> 41:57.377
We'll be in be in trouble if we get caught!

41:57.878 --> 41:58.754
Sandayuu-san?

41:58.795 --> 41:59.755
Where are you planning to go?

42:08.472 --> 42:09.932
T-Train...!

42:10.390 --> 42:12.601
Train? What's a train?

42:20.067 --> 42:21.318
That thing?!

42:29.618 --> 42:30.786
We'll be run over!

42:30.828 --> 42:32.037
We will not!

42:32.246 --> 42:33.413
It's impossible!

42:33.455 --> 42:34.915
I will not give up!

42:35.374 --> 42:36.625
It's definitely impossible!

42:36.959 --> 42:38.335
Shut up and be quiet!

42:44.341 --> 42:45.676
Even if you do this, it's pointless!

42:46.218 --> 42:47.135
It's over!

42:47.261 --> 42:48.262
I will not let it end!

42:49.388 --> 42:51.265
I will never give up!

42:51.682 --> 42:55.519
If you say that you are going to give up,
I will try harder and never give up!

43:00.816 --> 43:03.402
Why you, why you...

43:48.238 --> 43:50.365
It's been a while, Koyuki.

43:53.202 --> 43:55.287
Kazahana Dotou.

43:56.872 --> 43:58.457
So, it's been ten years?

43:59.374 --> 44:02.711
Now, let me see your face.

44:26.527 --> 44:31.782
Everyone! Our Princess Koyuki is watching.

44:32.449 --> 44:35.285
Victory will be ours!

44:35.410 --> 44:37.454
Yeah!

44:38.038 --> 44:38.747
What?

44:39.289 --> 44:40.040
Sandayuu?

44:42.918 --> 44:44.169
Kazahana Dotou!

44:44.545 --> 44:46.922
Do you know how long we have waited for this day?

44:47.631 --> 44:50.175
I am Asabasan Sandayuu, a representative of the 50th Brigade.

44:50.676 --> 44:55.347
Now, we will avenge the death of Kazahana
Sousetsu-sama from a decade ago.

44:55.722 --> 44:58.183
And we will take it out on you!

44:58.559 --> 45:00.727
Yeah!

45:05.816 --> 45:08.485
There are still people like that around?

45:09.111 --> 45:09.903
My deepest apologies.

45:10.487 --> 45:12.072
I will go now and deal with them.

45:13.323 --> 45:13.866
No.

45:14.950 --> 45:20.747
They need to experience something that is absolutely hopeless.

45:22.457 --> 45:23.417
Go!

46:22.893 --> 46:23.519
Sandayuu...

47:12.860 --> 47:14.820
Wait, Sasuke, don't follow them any further.

47:29.585 --> 47:30.377
This is so cruel.

47:32.129 --> 47:34.965
That is the result of their persistence.

47:36.300 --> 47:40.053
If they hadn't gone up against Dotou, they
wouldn't have ended up like this.

47:50.606 --> 47:51.273
Your Highness...

47:52.524 --> 47:54.985
I am very sorry...

47:55.986 --> 47:59.239
...to get tou involved in this.

48:01.200 --> 48:04.119
I, and everyone else...

48:05.120 --> 48:11.835
Because you were around, we didn't lose our hope.

48:13.712 --> 48:20.010
Ever since you were young, and even
now, you were always our princess.

48:22.387 --> 48:25.557
That's what I, Sandayuu, believe that you are...

48:27.142 --> 48:29.311
Please believe in yourself...

48:30.270 --> 48:33.440
You are our hope.

48:34.483 --> 48:35.943
Your Highness...

48:36.652 --> 48:39.863
Please... don't cry...

48:49.957 --> 48:52.459
You really are stupid, Sandayuu.

48:53.460 --> 48:56.004
I cannot cry because you have the eye drops.

48:59.842 --> 49:01.093
You should be satisfied.

49:02.928 --> 49:03.637
Let's go home.

49:06.181 --> 49:09.726
If we stay in this country any longer,
you won't be able to return safely.

49:10.561 --> 49:11.186
We're heading back.

49:12.813 --> 49:14.523
What are you going back to?

49:17.025 --> 49:18.944
Your home country is right here, isn't it?

49:19.570 --> 49:25.159
If you really want to go back, then defeat
Dotou and go back to your home!

49:26.660 --> 49:27.953
You don't know anything.

49:30.455 --> 49:32.166
There is no Spring in this country.

49:33.125 --> 49:37.087
It's a place where your tears freeze
and your heart will turn to stone!

49:37.671 --> 49:40.966
But you're able to change that, right?

49:44.052 --> 49:48.265
At least... I think Sandayuu-san believed in that.

49:51.018 --> 49:52.227
Stop talking nonsense!

49:54.396 --> 49:55.439
Hey, wait!

49:58.192 --> 49:58.942
Leave me alone!

50:13.790 --> 50:14.291
Oh shit!

50:22.174 --> 50:23.383
Sakura, where is Naruto?

50:24.885 --> 50:26.386
No way, don't tell me...

50:32.684 --> 50:36.146
Do you think I will let you go so easily?

50:37.022 --> 50:38.607
Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!

50:42.986 --> 50:45.656
You have become beautiful, Koyuki.

50:46.865 --> 50:50.035
Do you have the hexagonal crystal?

50:50.953 --> 50:51.620
Yes.

50:51.954 --> 50:52.871
That's good.

50:53.622 --> 50:57.084
Because that's the only thing that connects
the Kazahana family as a whole.

50:58.377 --> 51:01.088
And it's also the key to the treasure.

51:02.172 --> 51:03.799
The key to the treasure?

51:04.883 --> 51:08.804
When I took over this country from your father,

51:09.680 --> 51:12.724
there was nothing left of the Kazahana family.

51:13.934 --> 51:17.604
Sousetsu surely must have kept the treasure elsewhere.

51:18.397 --> 51:22.234
I looked for it, and I finally found it.

51:23.318 --> 51:26.238
It's a massive weapon hidden in the Rainbow Glaciers.

51:27.239 --> 51:30.492
And I have found a keyhole that fits the hexagonal crystal.

51:33.036 --> 51:35.247
It I get hold of the Kazahana's weapon,

51:35.622 --> 51:41.587
our country will have the power to overcome
the five other shinobi nations!

51:42.296 --> 51:43.755
I will never let that happen!

51:47.176 --> 51:47.885
You!

51:48.343 --> 51:48.927
You bastard!

51:49.303 --> 51:50.053
How did you get in here?

51:51.346 --> 51:53.015
Don't underestimate a ninja.

52:05.777 --> 52:06.862
My deepest apologies.

52:07.571 --> 52:10.491
That kid was quite troublesome.

52:10.824 --> 52:14.077
Oh, so he can use Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu?
(Mass Shadow Clone Technique)

52:14.786 --> 52:17.206
I don't understand it well, but this kid...

52:17.706 --> 52:20.125
It seems that he has an enormous amount of chakra.

52:21.001 --> 52:23.921
Just in case anything happens, should we attach the device?

52:24.505 --> 52:28.217
Yes, we have an interesting guinea pig.

52:47.152 --> 52:47.778
What?

52:48.320 --> 52:49.988
It is a chakra control device.

52:50.614 --> 52:53.075
The ultimate technique for sucking out chakra.

52:53.575 --> 52:55.744
And it creates an impenetrable wall around him.

52:56.286 --> 52:59.331
He won't be able to pull it off nor will he be able to destroy it.

53:00.082 --> 53:01.291
There's no way.

53:04.378 --> 53:06.713
My power... is fading...

53:11.051 --> 53:13.470
You're not a real ninja.

53:14.471 --> 53:15.681
Just a little brat.

53:18.642 --> 53:19.601
Damn it...

53:24.481 --> 53:29.027
Now then, will you hand over the hexagonal crystal?

53:48.255 --> 53:48.922
This is...

53:52.050 --> 53:55.387
Don't fool around with me! This is just a fake!

53:56.430 --> 53:57.389
That's not possible...

54:02.686 --> 54:04.021
Hatake Kakashi...

54:04.646 --> 54:05.105
What?

54:06.190 --> 54:06.982
I see.

54:07.608 --> 54:11.195
He'd be able to switch it easily.

54:11.570 --> 54:14.531
We will bring Kakashi right away.

54:15.324 --> 54:16.408
There is no need for that.

54:21.288 --> 54:24.124
They will soon come here.

54:25.209 --> 54:27.711
And I shall wait until then.

54:56.865 --> 54:58.075
Damn it...

54:58.617 --> 54:59.910
My power doesn't even kick in...

55:00.536 --> 55:04.706
Damn it. If I had known something like this was gonna happen,
I would have trained more in Nawanuke no Jutsu.
(Escape Techniques)

55:04.706 --> 55:05.707
(Escape Techniques)

55:25.018 --> 55:29.982
Even if I am not able to use my chakra, being able to do
something in such circumstances makes me a real ninja.

56:04.183 --> 56:05.142
Well deserved.

56:06.018 --> 56:07.060
You too.

56:08.812 --> 56:09.229
I guess so.

56:11.815 --> 56:12.399
Spring...

56:15.611 --> 56:18.030
There is no Spring... What does that mean?

56:23.619 --> 56:25.162
"When it is Spring, you will be able to see."

56:26.413 --> 56:27.372
That's what my father said.

56:29.333 --> 56:31.710
Father, what is Spring?

56:32.544 --> 56:35.923
I see. You haven't seen Spring before, right?

56:36.882 --> 56:37.382
Right.

56:38.217 --> 56:40.802
Koyuki, close your eyes.

56:43.055 --> 56:45.974
Imagine a flower garden.

56:50.270 --> 56:51.522
Isn't it beautiful?

56:52.731 --> 56:54.858
And then imagine yourself running around in that place.

57:02.491 --> 57:03.116
How does it feel?

57:04.076 --> 57:06.703
Doesn't it feel warm and make you happy?

57:07.371 --> 57:07.955
Yes!

57:08.622 --> 57:09.623
That is what you call Spring.

57:12.167 --> 57:14.586
Don't give up, and believe in the future.

57:16.046 --> 57:18.632
Some day, Spring will definitely come.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.554
But there is no Spring in this country.

57:24.972 --> 57:30.853
My father died, I ran away from this country,
and I decided to stop believing.

57:32.271 --> 57:37.276
I keep on running and running away, and
I keep on telling lies. I even lie to myself.

57:38.360 --> 57:40.070
So I act like other people.

57:41.363 --> 57:45.242
I can only be an actress, there is nothing else for me.

58:05.053 --> 58:07.181
Even if you do that, nothing is going to change.

58:30.621 --> 58:31.205
See?

58:32.206 --> 58:34.082
You have to give up in the end.

58:40.172 --> 58:44.051
If you give up, I'm sure it'll be quite a relief.

58:47.137 --> 58:48.764
No one will bother you,

58:49.890 --> 58:51.642
or even pay attention to you.

58:52.643 --> 58:54.394
It was alright, but it was still really painful.

58:55.771 --> 58:58.774
I felt there was no place for me in this world.

59:01.026 --> 59:01.610
But...

59:09.034 --> 59:09.618
But...

59:10.953 --> 59:13.372
But... I have good friends now.

59:15.165 --> 59:19.169
And when I tried my best and
didn't give up, good things happened!

59:24.007 --> 59:29.054
If you give up, your dreams, and
everything else, will end right here!

59:36.728 --> 59:37.062
Stop it!

59:39.398 --> 59:43.443
Your dad, old man Sandayuu...

59:44.862 --> 59:46.780
I will prove...

59:49.116 --> 59:53.328
...that they weren't wrong!

59:56.165 --> 59:56.790
Naruto...

01:00:14.308 --> 01:00:17.102
I'll save you right now...

01:00:45.005 --> 01:00:45.839
It's an enemy raid!

01:00:47.508 --> 01:00:50.552
That Kakashi. So he planned a night assault, eh?

01:00:51.637 --> 01:00:52.679
It's going according to plan.

01:01:02.314 --> 01:01:03.690
Hey since when...?

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.873
I said not to underestimate a ninja.

01:01:40.936 --> 01:01:41.895
Damn it!

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.690
Wait, wait, Naruto!

01:01:44.773 --> 01:01:45.190
It's me!

01:01:48.152 --> 01:01:49.111
Kakashi-sensei!

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:50.529
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:01:51.238 --> 01:01:52.865
I am glad to see the princess is well.

01:01:53.532 --> 01:01:53.907
Yes.

01:01:55.534 --> 01:01:58.620
You switched the hexagonal crystal for a fake one, didn't you?

01:01:59.705 --> 01:02:00.581
I'm Sorry.

01:02:01.248 --> 01:02:04.501
I figured that those guys were after it.

01:02:09.673 --> 01:02:10.883
Just for this...

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:15.429
We can't hold that area any longer.

01:02:15.637 --> 01:02:16.513
Sakura-chan!

01:02:16.597 --> 01:02:17.306
Sasuke!

01:02:17.764 --> 01:02:18.348
Down here!

01:02:42.581 --> 01:02:43.248
Dotou.

01:02:43.582 --> 01:02:45.542
Well done, Koyuki.

01:02:50.714 --> 01:02:51.298
Wait!

01:02:53.759 --> 01:02:54.218
Don't tell me...

01:02:59.681 --> 01:03:01.391
Everyone seems to have forgotten,

01:03:02.226 --> 01:03:04.186
that I am an actress.

01:03:05.395 --> 01:03:06.688
It's true.

01:03:07.439 --> 01:03:10.692
Koyuki acted the whole scene.

01:03:17.574 --> 01:03:19.952
Yes, the whole thing is an act.

01:03:23.747 --> 01:03:24.957
That's why I said...

01:03:25.999 --> 01:03:27.751
I am an actress!

01:03:28.001 --> 01:03:30.003
Damn you!

01:03:30.712 --> 01:03:31.129
Princess!

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.926
I knew about this, Naruto.

01:03:36.718 --> 01:03:40.472
When I returned here was when I would die.

01:03:41.807 --> 01:03:43.350
That's why at least...

01:03:47.062 --> 01:03:49.273
Stop it! Princess!

01:03:50.107 --> 01:03:52.818
Naruto... it was all thanks to you...

01:03:54.319 --> 01:03:58.198
Until the very, very end... I kept running away...

01:03:58.657 --> 01:03:59.491
No!

01:03:59.741 --> 01:04:01.535
What you are doing right now is the same as running away!

01:04:02.119 --> 01:04:04.204
You can't die!

01:04:05.914 --> 01:04:07.040
Father...

01:04:08.125 --> 01:04:09.126
Sandayuu...

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:21.180
Princess!

01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:35.110
I am not going to die from this toy-like katana.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:45.829
That's right!

01:04:46.121 --> 01:04:49.082
This is the new advanced model of chakra armor!

01:04:54.505 --> 01:04:57.174
Don't touch her with your dirty hands!

01:05:02.137 --> 01:05:02.930
Naruto!

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.348
It's pointless.

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:08.143
Your chakra is completely sealed!

01:05:10.896 --> 01:05:14.316
Well, let's go Koyuki. To the place beyond the rainbow.

01:05:18.987 --> 01:05:19.488
Damn it.

01:05:47.057 --> 01:05:47.975
Naruto!

01:06:08.412 --> 01:06:09.663
Damn it...

01:06:10.914 --> 01:06:14.293
I will never give up...

01:06:18.046 --> 01:06:22.342
Even if you don't like it,
I will follow you wherever you go.

01:06:23.552 --> 01:06:25.846
Damn it!

01:06:33.562 --> 01:06:34.188
Hop on!

01:06:49.536 --> 01:06:50.871
So I ended up here after all...

01:07:22.611 --> 01:07:23.612
Sakura, now?

01:07:23.987 --> 01:07:24.530
Just a little bit more!

01:07:31.495 --> 01:07:31.954
I get it!

01:07:32.454 --> 01:07:35.123
After five seconds, turn twenty degrees
left and run thirty meters ahead!

01:07:35.541 --> 01:07:36.792
That's where the tree branch is!

01:07:37.167 --> 01:07:37.626
Alright!

01:07:39.878 --> 01:07:41.547
Whatever you do will be useless!

01:07:48.762 --> 01:07:50.597
I told you that it's useless!

01:08:02.776 --> 01:08:04.069
Sakura Fubuki no Jutsu!
(Sakura Blizzard Technique)

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:05.362
As if.

01:08:15.706 --> 01:08:19.209
We Snow ninja aren't that weak!

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:20.711
Maybe.

01:08:21.962 --> 01:08:22.962
Shishi Rendan!
(Lion Combo)

01:08:42.608 --> 01:08:43.442
What happened?

01:08:43.901 --> 01:08:44.859
I'm not sure...

01:08:45.611 --> 01:08:47.237
...but maybe...

01:08:55.162 --> 01:08:56.913
Do you have any chance of winning?

01:08:57.497 --> 01:08:59.082
After all, you ran away last time.

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:01.126
It can't be helped.

01:09:01.919 --> 01:09:04.587
I'll show you something original.

01:09:07.633 --> 01:09:08.133
Raikiri!
(Lighting Edge)

01:09:10.219 --> 01:09:12.220
Hyouton! Rouga Nadare no Jutsu!
(Ice Element, Rouga Nadare's Technique)

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:18.727
What...?

01:09:26.734 --> 01:09:27.903
That was so close.

01:09:33.826 --> 01:09:37.328
Even if ninjutsu and genjutsu don't work
on you, a shinobi still has taijutsu!

01:09:37.955 --> 01:09:39.872
You've depended too much on that armor!

01:10:01.937 --> 01:10:02.729
Where is the treasure?

01:10:03.438 --> 01:10:04.356
Where is the treasure?!

01:10:17.953 --> 01:10:20.289
It's getting warm... This is...

01:10:22.082 --> 01:10:23.500
A generator?!

01:10:24.334 --> 01:10:26.879
Is this what you call Kazahana's treasure?!

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.338
Princess!

01:10:38.557 --> 01:10:39.057
Naruto!

01:10:43.145 --> 01:10:46.857
Hyoton, kokuryuu Boufuusetsu!
(Ice Element Black Dragon Blizzard)

01:10:53.614 --> 01:10:54.823
Naruto!

01:11:05.626 --> 01:11:06.418
What's wrong?

01:11:07.628 --> 01:11:10.797
It's not affecting me at all...

01:11:13.091 --> 01:11:14.676
Naruto, stop it!

01:11:15.177 --> 01:11:17.387
This time, you will really die!

01:11:18.013 --> 01:11:19.389
Believe in me!

01:11:21.141 --> 01:11:24.102
If you believe in me,

01:11:25.479 --> 01:11:26.897
I will definitely...

01:11:27.773 --> 01:11:29.191
...not lose!

01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:38.075
No way... Don't tell me that his chakra is leaking out...

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.793
Die!

01:12:12.526 --> 01:12:13.235
Take this!

01:12:13.318 --> 01:12:13.819
Chidori!

01:12:22.494 --> 01:12:25.914
As if that level of jutsu would work against me!

01:12:27.875 --> 01:12:30.878
Naruto... I made a crack...

01:12:32.045 --> 01:12:35.549
You handle the rest...

01:12:37.009 --> 01:12:38.510
Naruto!

01:12:47.811 --> 01:12:53.317
Hey, Demon Fox, stop lying there doing nothing!

01:12:56.153 --> 01:12:58.113
Show me your stuff!

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:14.379
What is that?

01:13:18.383 --> 01:13:18.800
What?!

01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:21.970
I will pay back what you did to me...

01:13:22.679 --> 01:13:24.431
...with compound interest!

01:13:25.933 --> 01:13:27.017
What big words!

01:13:27.434 --> 01:13:31.188
Souryuu Boufuusetsu!

01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:52.125
It's all over.

01:13:53.043 --> 01:13:55.921
From now on, everything is over!

01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:10.936
I told you, it's not over yet.

01:14:15.816 --> 01:14:19.153
If you say something is over, it means
that justice prevails and evil loses!

01:14:19.695 --> 01:14:21.905
It's obvious that the story will have a happy ending!

01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:26.034
Naruto!

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:33.959
I will believe in you! This Unlucky Princess
has accepted you as the greatest ninja!

01:14:35.002 --> 01:14:36.211
That...

01:14:36.253 --> 01:14:37.504
...I already know!

01:14:53.896 --> 01:14:55.105
The seven color chakra,

01:14:55.647 --> 01:14:56.690
just like in the movie.

01:15:03.906 --> 01:15:06.116
Take this! Rasengan!

01:15:36.271 --> 01:15:37.147
What?!

01:15:37.356 --> 01:15:39.399
Don't tell me!

01:15:40.359 --> 01:15:42.528
Is this some kind of alternate world?!

01:15:46.281 --> 01:15:47.491
Believe in the future.

01:15:48.909 --> 01:15:51.537
If you do, Spring will come.

01:15:53.831 --> 01:15:56.083
Koyuki, what would you like to do when Spring comes?

01:15:58.335 --> 01:16:00.712
I'll become a princess.

01:16:02.422 --> 01:16:04.675
Hm, what kind of princess?

01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:10.848
Hm... A kind, strong one.

01:16:12.182 --> 01:16:14.977
A princess who believes in justice!

01:16:17.646 --> 01:16:19.273
That's going to be very hard work.

01:16:19.982 --> 01:16:22.192
I did say that before...

01:16:23.986 --> 01:16:28.323
But if you don't give up and keep on believing in your dreams,

01:16:29.616 --> 01:16:31.160
one day, for sure, you will become one.

01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:41.503
Can you see...

01:16:42.337 --> 01:16:46.800
...that a very beautiful princess is standing here?

01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:01.482
But I am not quite decided yet.

01:17:02.608 --> 01:17:04.276
There is one more thing that I want to become.

01:17:05.402 --> 01:17:06.778
What is it?

01:17:08.071 --> 01:17:08.780
An actress!

01:17:21.919 --> 01:17:24.630

So it's going to be Winter again?

01:20:59.178 --> 01:21:02.806
No, not at all. We will use that device
and study it, and if we refine it,

01:21:03.515 --> 01:21:07.352
then some day the Snow Country
will be called the Spring Country.

01:21:08.187 --> 01:21:10.397
But you know, it's going to be a waste.

01:21:11.023 --> 01:21:14.359
You're so popular, and now you're going to quit acting.

01:21:14.943 --> 01:21:16.528
Who said that I will stop acting?

01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:22.284
As the monarchy and the actress of the Snow
Country, I will show that I can do both.
