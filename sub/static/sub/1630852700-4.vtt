WEBVTT

00:21.833 --> 00:23.791
Go on.
Grab that plastic.

00:39.583 --> 00:42.541
Your brother was weak.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.458
Don't make the same mistake, young man.

00:46.541 --> 00:47.750
I'm family, Tomás.

00:49.666 --> 00:50.708
You're not.

00:54.041 --> 00:56.291
All right, let's go. Cover this.

01:02.250 --> 01:05.250
<i>Stay calm.</i>
<i>There's too much riding on this.</i>

01:40.958 --> 01:42.916
Someone could hear you.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.875
Take deep breaths.

01:44.958 --> 01:46.708
<i>In and out.</i>

01:46.791 --> 01:48.500
Enough. I'm good.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.500
I should've done something.

01:58.375 --> 02:02.125
Lidia was dead the moment she took
the money from Yannick, you know that.

02:21.541 --> 02:22.416
Sara.

02:25.416 --> 02:27.458
I was just looking for you.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.541
And why would you think
you could find me there

02:30.625 --> 02:32.791
instead of where I left you?

02:32.875 --> 02:35.500
I don't know, but I'm happy I found you.

02:35.583 --> 02:37.583
You do not seem happy.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.916
And I want to know why.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.166
- You look…
- Scared?

03:00.291 --> 03:01.125
Yes.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.625
It's true.

03:03.708 --> 03:04.916
I'm terrified.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.333
Because I'm about to…

03:18.750 --> 03:20.458
Thank you for saving me earlier.

03:21.958 --> 03:23.583
I should save you more often.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.208
You wouldn't mind seeing me again?

03:29.958 --> 03:31.666
I have something better in mind.

03:32.916 --> 03:35.166
I will drive you back to your hotel.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.250
I don't want to bother you.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.500
Nonsense.

03:38.583 --> 03:40.125
It is dangerous out there.

03:41.750 --> 03:47.416
Especially for an attractive woman
wandering alone at night.

03:48.166 --> 03:51.958
She might stumble into places
she's not supposed to be.

03:54.041 --> 03:55.041
It's a long drive.

03:56.583 --> 03:57.958
Where are you staying?

03:58.041 --> 04:02.291
<i>Jenny, you get into a car with</i>
<i>this fool, everything gets complicated.</i>

04:02.375 --> 04:03.541
Sara?

04:03.625 --> 04:05.083
I'm sorry.

04:05.166 --> 04:07.333
<i>You're staying</i>
<i>at the Hotel Josefina.</i>

04:07.416 --> 04:09.291
- The Josefina.
- The Josefina.

04:11.625 --> 04:15.750
- What the hell are you doing?
- Calling an audible. Saving her life.

04:15.833 --> 04:16.750
Shit.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.291
This is why
my Black ass never leaves the desk.

04:35.958 --> 04:37.750
The Josefina
is a beautiful hotel.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.416
I have had friends stay there many times.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.625
What side are you on?

04:46.583 --> 04:50.875
- South side.
- The south side? I see.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.708
- With the larger suites for families.
- Mm.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.041
I enjoy the space.

04:57.041 --> 04:59.666
My boys are staying
with their grandma in Alicante.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.458
Family is everything to me.

05:04.541 --> 05:06.750
And do you have
any pictures of them?

05:13.291 --> 05:14.541
I forgot my phone.

05:16.041 --> 05:20.083
My husband used to say
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached.

05:29.166 --> 05:31.708
We only got a few minutes
to make this room look lived-in.

05:38.291 --> 05:39.625
Where'd you get this shit?

05:39.708 --> 05:42.291
I knew sooner or later
she'd need a cover story. Here.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.291
What up?

05:43.375 --> 05:49.041
I need you to burn in
a picture of Jenny with two kids. Male.

05:49.125 --> 05:51.750
No problem. I'll pull a unicorn
out my ass while I'm at it.

05:51.833 --> 05:52.666
Get it done.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.333
Thank you for bringing me.

06:03.416 --> 06:05.958
I will come with you
to your room.

06:06.041 --> 06:09.916
I would very much
like to see those pictures of your boys.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.500
Okay.

06:16.791 --> 06:18.791
Nice try. You're in room 407.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.041
God damn it. Jenny, you don't have a key.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.708
I got it. Jenny, I'm headed your way.

06:29.375 --> 06:30.500
<i>Hola.</i>

07:05.125 --> 07:09.041
I've done great things in my life,
but those two beat it all.

07:19.041 --> 07:23.541
Will you please forgive me
for being so on edge this evening?

07:24.666 --> 07:26.083
There's nothing to forgive.

07:26.958 --> 07:31.083
Well, that is a shame, you know.

07:33.333 --> 07:37.750
Because I'm in the mood to be punished.

07:47.958 --> 07:49.166
Why are you shaking?

07:50.958 --> 07:52.625
I haven't been with a man since…

07:54.000 --> 07:55.125
I don't know if I can.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.083
I've had enough
of this asshole for a night.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.708
- Jenny, we're gonna get you out. Just--
- <i>Wait.</i>

08:30.166 --> 08:31.625
I like to do things my way.

08:56.125 --> 08:58.583
No. Keep it on.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.916
- Seriously?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

09:04.291 --> 09:05.875
She's not out of the woods yet.

09:14.208 --> 09:16.041
Okay, girls.
Let's pick up the pace.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.333
No sign of Claire?

09:19.416 --> 09:22.083
Coach said she's still nauseous
so she's gonna take the morning.

09:22.166 --> 09:25.458
- My mom had to spend the night with her.
- Bitch is cracking.

09:25.541 --> 09:26.875
Look at you all gangsta.

09:26.958 --> 09:29.208
What happened to my nice and sweet Becca?

09:29.291 --> 09:30.833
The Spanish air killed her.

09:30.916 --> 09:33.458
No, really. You're different.

09:33.541 --> 09:34.708
"Different," good?

09:34.791 --> 09:37.750
"Different," strong and badass.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.291
It's this trip.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.208
Being away from home,
from my mom, sort of…

09:42.291 --> 09:44.416
It's all starting to feel right.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.583
Unless you're Claire.

09:45.666 --> 09:48.208
I can do so much better
than a tiny, featherless bird.

09:48.291 --> 09:49.958
Do tell, you dark queen.

09:50.041 --> 09:52.916
You better catch up
or I'm gonna end up winning this thing.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.625
Who the hell are you?

09:54.708 --> 09:56.250
Come on, girls. Let's go!

10:07.750 --> 10:08.791
Uncle--

10:38.583 --> 10:40.125
I'll wait outside.

10:40.208 --> 10:41.625
You've seen my ass before.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.416
- Look, what you did last night--
- Had to be done.

10:54.125 --> 10:57.208
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.750
He didn't fuck me,
if that's what worries you.

11:02.666 --> 11:03.708
I fucked him.

11:27.083 --> 11:28.958
- Becca?
- Peeing.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.208
What brings you back so soon?

11:32.291 --> 11:33.708
I needed a sports bra.

11:34.541 --> 11:35.375
Huh.

11:35.958 --> 11:37.375
I thought you missed me.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.875
Are you trying to guilt-trip me?

11:42.958 --> 11:43.958
For sure.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.291
You look terrible.

11:50.583 --> 11:53.916
Yeah, I, uh,
didn't sleep very well last night.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.916
- Jet lag is no joke.

11:58.916 --> 11:59.916
Everything else good?

12:00.708 --> 12:03.541
Apart from the German team
trying to mess with us? Yeah.

12:03.625 --> 12:04.958
What do you mean?

12:05.041 --> 12:08.583
Yesterday at lunch, somebody,
probably somebody from the German team,

12:08.666 --> 12:10.333
put a dead bird in Claire's soup.

12:10.416 --> 12:11.583
Seriously?

12:11.666 --> 12:13.666
Coach says
this stuff happens all the time.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.916
Teams trying
to get an edge on their biggest rival.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.416
Is Claire okay?

12:17.500 --> 12:18.708
Not really.

12:18.791 --> 12:21.166
The pressure
was already starting to get to her,

12:21.250 --> 12:23.958
but now, Maddie has a real shot
at winning this thing.

12:24.041 --> 12:24.916
What about you?

12:25.750 --> 12:26.750
Do you wanna place?

12:27.833 --> 12:29.291
I'm not delusional, Mom.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.375
Well, you seem happy.

12:35.916 --> 12:38.625
I think I'm starting
to find myself a little.

12:38.708 --> 12:39.666
Does that make sense?

12:42.583 --> 12:44.041
How's the trip going for you?

12:45.250 --> 12:46.458
It's, uh…

12:47.666 --> 12:49.583
You know, it's been an adventure.

12:49.666 --> 12:52.791
Seeing some new places.
Meeting some new people.

12:52.875 --> 12:55.541
It's been interesting.

12:55.625 --> 13:00.125
This is your first time outside the US
and you've been a little wild.

13:00.208 --> 13:01.791
- But, it's okay.

13:01.875 --> 13:04.875
You're finding yourself too. Just be safe.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.500
You know it.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.666
And, hey, the haircut isn't that bad.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.333
Wait.

13:31.416 --> 13:34.458
You sent one of our comrades after me
so that I would kill him?

13:34.541 --> 13:36.041
- Yes.
- Why?

13:36.125 --> 13:38.625
He played his part. Like all of us.

13:38.708 --> 13:41.125
What part? He wasn't the enemy.

13:41.208 --> 13:43.833
Everyone is the enemy, you stupid idiot.

13:43.916 --> 13:45.583
That is why I sent him after you.

13:45.666 --> 13:46.541
To teach you.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.875
Do you even know
your part anymore? Your role?

13:49.875 --> 13:51.916
To serve the Motherland with honor.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.041
Open your mouth.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.750
I said open your mouth.

13:57.916 --> 13:59.916
You do exactly what you are told.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.166
You are a bitch for Mother Russia.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.625
Not Faina Orlov.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.083
I see and hear everything.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.125
I know you more than you know yourself.

14:07.208 --> 14:09.166
You behave like a sissy.

14:21.916 --> 14:22.833
Let her go.

14:22.916 --> 14:23.958
Let me out.

14:27.291 --> 14:28.791
She is done anyway.

14:33.083 --> 14:36.125
Something doesn't add up
with the Caleros and their wacko group.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.916
They're zealots. They rarely make sense.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.708
Except why risk
your reputation and your wealth

14:41.791 --> 14:43.958
to assassinate
the prime minister of Spain?

14:45.958 --> 14:48.250
- Unless…
- Unless it's personal.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.250
Take a look at this.

14:58.166 --> 15:02.583
"Undocumented immigrant
murders police officer Eduardo Santos."

15:02.666 --> 15:05.125
This Eduardo Santos
is Felipe's brother-in-law.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.958
- He's married to his younger sister, Inés.
- Hmm.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.166
So, Felipe is using
his brother-in-law's murder

15:11.250 --> 15:13.916
to convince young men
that the liberal prime minister

15:14.000 --> 15:15.333
is destroying the Fatherland.

15:15.416 --> 15:19.625
Felipe has motive,
but he's not the one pulling the strings.

15:19.708 --> 15:21.000
Gideon.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.708
The moment that Jackal
said his name, he was terrified.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.583
But you two don't seem surprised.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.875
We don't actually
have any intel on Gideon.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.541
But Felipe is too much of a dilettante

15:31.625 --> 15:35.750
to be masterminding the murder
of a political figure all by himself.

15:35.833 --> 15:39.208
He had to be responding
to a more powerful third party.

15:39.291 --> 15:42.458
Someone with real money
and international influence.

15:42.541 --> 15:45.916
So, I take it Gideon
is not this guy's given Christian name.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.125
Any idea who he is?

15:48.041 --> 15:49.041
Not really.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.666
But we do have a hunch
on how things connect around here.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.416
Andrés is a full-blown diplomat
with major contacts all throughout Europe.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.291
And I'd pretty much bet my bottom dollar

15:57.375 --> 16:00.125
he's the link between
these Jackals and their boss, Gideon.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.458
You telling me everything?

16:01.541 --> 16:03.208
I'm telling you what I know for sure.

16:03.291 --> 16:05.791
The Calero brothers
are the hook to catch our big fish.

16:06.833 --> 16:10.666
Lucky for us, Felipe is treating me
to a date at his estate this afternoon.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.041
What time is it now?

16:14.458 --> 16:15.666
11:15.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.875
His driver
is picking me up in less than an hour

16:17.958 --> 16:20.333
and I still have
to get back to the Josefina.

16:26.041 --> 16:29.125
Okay, um, listen.

16:29.875 --> 16:31.250
I, um…

16:33.333 --> 16:34.333
Just stay on Felipe.

16:34.416 --> 16:36.458
Learn all you can
about the Calero brothers.

16:36.541 --> 16:38.500
Anything that can lead us to Gideon.

16:38.583 --> 16:39.958
You need anything else?

16:40.708 --> 16:42.250
Right now, I could use a mint.

16:43.625 --> 16:44.875
Okay.

16:44.958 --> 16:47.916
Chris will take you.
I've got more work to do here.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.333
I'm gonna need the whole box.

16:53.250 --> 16:54.666
Come on, Chris.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.416
Davi?

17:09.333 --> 17:12.916
I will unfriend your lady on Facebook
if you're screwing with me.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.208
If it isn't the notorious
Chauncey Lew in the flesh.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.958
Well, look what we have here.

17:24.083 --> 17:28.083
I would love to stay and chat, um, ladies.

17:28.166 --> 17:30.291
I don't wanna hurt you. So…

17:36.208 --> 17:38.500
You get that out of your system?

17:38.583 --> 17:39.625
Ohana?

17:39.708 --> 17:41.750
That's Chief Inspector to you.

17:43.583 --> 17:44.958
Moving on up, I see.

17:45.833 --> 17:46.875
What division?

17:46.958 --> 17:50.208
I'm in charge of Europol's
Criminal Investigations Unit now.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.000
I shouldn't have trusted Davi.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.791
People with integrity
always let you down, don't they?

17:57.875 --> 18:00.041
Yeah.

18:01.208 --> 18:02.750
Are these really necessary?

18:02.833 --> 18:03.750
Maybe.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.666
Maybe not.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.958
Tell me, what brings you to Madrid?

18:09.041 --> 18:10.375
Vacation.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.583
Is that right?

18:11.666 --> 18:15.166
So, you were not drawn here
by a strange series of incidents.

18:15.250 --> 18:20.166
Three unconnected individuals exhibiting
outrageously uncharacteristic behaviors?

18:21.125 --> 18:22.500
No.

18:22.583 --> 18:27.083
I was actually drawn here
by the sangria, wine, and paella.

18:32.958 --> 18:34.541
I do not believe you.

18:34.625 --> 18:35.708
You should.

18:35.791 --> 18:36.958
Like Marseille?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.416
Marseille wasn't my fault.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.000
You had us believing in bullshit
and people died.

18:42.083 --> 18:45.166
And you're lucky
that all the CIA did was fire you.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.416
Which means you have no reason
to be conducting any kind of operation.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.541
- How do you know they fired me?
- Excuse me?

18:50.625 --> 18:52.666
How do you know they fired me?

18:53.875 --> 18:55.833
Ever think that's my cover story?

18:55.916 --> 18:58.291
I do not care. I'm taking you in.

18:58.375 --> 18:59.375
You do that.

19:00.250 --> 19:02.583
And you just see how the Agency feels

19:02.666 --> 19:08.041
about a newly promoted chief inspector
interfering with one of their covert ops.

19:11.416 --> 19:12.750
You deserve the heads-up.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.583
You know, I'm a patient woman.

19:32.375 --> 19:35.291
So, the moment you screw up,
and you will screw up,

19:35.375 --> 19:36.416
I'll be there.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.916
I have no doubt you will.

19:39.583 --> 19:45.583
Well, it is always a pleasure
doing Business with Europol.

19:46.833 --> 19:50.416
I can only hope you don't have
a body count the next time we meet.

20:48.083 --> 20:48.916
<i>Gracias.</i>

20:50.291 --> 20:51.958
I'm a little intimidated.

20:52.041 --> 20:53.541
There's no reason to be.

20:57.208 --> 21:01.041
You are by far more beautiful
than anything you will see around here.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.250
Are you going to introduce me?

21:03.333 --> 21:04.375
Of course.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.833
Sara, this is
my lovely sister, Inés.

21:06.916 --> 21:08.458
Inés, Sara.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.833
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

21:12.916 --> 21:16.166
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.291
You know what you need to do.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.375
Are these all your nephews?

21:23.458 --> 21:26.416
No. Just young men I help out.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.041
But they are like family to me.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.041
Your brother was weak.

21:35.208 --> 21:38.875
That does not mean that they are all
coming to lunch with us, does it?

21:39.500 --> 21:41.541
It will be just the three of us.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.791
Thank you
for your hospitality.

21:44.875 --> 21:45.958
Well, thank you.

21:46.041 --> 21:49.541
But I wish that Felipe had told me
exactly when you were arriving.

21:50.541 --> 21:52.791
- I still need time.
- Don't worry.

21:52.875 --> 21:54.458
There's time, because…

21:55.458 --> 21:59.708
I have something
very special to show you before lunch.

22:19.333 --> 22:20.500
Do you see that one?

22:22.291 --> 22:23.625
Impressive.

22:24.833 --> 22:25.875
Miura.

22:26.666 --> 22:27.875
My gladiator.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.791
He had a marvelous run.

22:31.875 --> 22:33.166
The crowd loved him.

22:34.583 --> 22:37.375
The president
had no choice but to pardon him.

22:38.916 --> 22:42.083
And now he will get to
live out the rest of his days

22:42.166 --> 22:43.541
as my prized stud.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.291
He reminds me of you.

22:49.583 --> 22:51.416
Strong and fearless.

22:54.333 --> 22:56.625
That is how a man should be.

22:59.791 --> 23:01.666
Fiercely protective of his family.

23:04.041 --> 23:05.125
And his country.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.083
Let's go.

23:34.625 --> 23:35.625
Diego?

23:36.750 --> 23:38.500
What the hell are you doing here?

23:39.833 --> 23:42.541
I thought
I made it very clear

23:42.625 --> 23:44.333
that you were to take the day off.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.333
I asked you a question.

23:48.416 --> 23:49.666
I heard you.

23:51.125 --> 23:53.708
Felipe,
we don't wanna be late to lunch.

23:53.791 --> 23:56.125
Yes, you don't want to be late for lunch.

23:56.208 --> 23:57.666
The lady is hungry.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.875
He is my sister's son

24:01.208 --> 24:04.125
and has been battling
some demons for a while.

24:04.208 --> 24:05.625
Who's your lady friend?

24:10.166 --> 24:11.500
I am Sara Fonte.

24:15.666 --> 24:16.583
Diego.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.083
The only nephew
he's got left.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.375
Listen.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.583
You need to go back
to the guest house.

24:22.666 --> 24:25.791
Did you know that my brother
used to be my Uncle Felipe's favorite?

24:25.875 --> 24:26.791
Diego…

24:28.208 --> 24:30.916
Your mother is waiting.
She's made lunch for us.

24:31.750 --> 24:33.750
He will not be
joining us for lunch.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.666
I'm going to
drive him back to the guest house

24:37.750 --> 24:41.916
and make sure
he lies down and gets some rest.

24:46.291 --> 24:49.916
My driver will take you
back to the house, okay?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.416
I will join you shortly.

25:35.375 --> 25:37.291
<i>Anya is simply unfit.</i>

25:37.375 --> 25:40.041
<i>She must be removed immediately</i>
<i>from the Yaroslav assignment.</i>

25:41.958 --> 25:43.166
I don't understand.

25:44.083 --> 25:47.041
It was you
who specifically wanted her for this.

25:47.875 --> 25:52.000
Yes. She showed
great potential at the Institute.

25:52.083 --> 25:55.041
But now I know she is just…

25:56.250 --> 25:58.000
a naive country girl.

25:59.208 --> 26:02.375
You called her your "greatest asset."

26:02.458 --> 26:03.958
I have another girl.

26:04.750 --> 26:08.500
She is ready.
She is scoring exceptionally high--

26:08.583 --> 26:10.125
No.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.625
There is no time now to swap agents.

26:13.875 --> 26:18.375
Anya is too close
to accessing the Chinese Embassy.

26:18.958 --> 26:19.958
Well…

26:20.041 --> 26:22.916
You and I can come up with a new plan,

26:23.000 --> 26:24.708
as you and I have done before.

26:24.791 --> 26:25.625
Oh…

26:26.708 --> 26:31.125
You forget your place,
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.

26:31.208 --> 26:35.375
The time of "you and I" has passed.

26:36.625 --> 26:39.541
Anya will reclaim the Yaroslav Program

26:40.625 --> 26:42.750
before it is slipped out of the country.

26:42.833 --> 26:44.333
Is that clear?

26:44.416 --> 26:45.541
Yes, sir.

26:46.125 --> 26:51.041
I should not have to remind you
what the Yaroslav Program means for us.

26:51.625 --> 26:52.458
No, sir.

26:53.166 --> 26:55.375
And remember, Svetlana.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.125
If your girl does fail…

27:02.125 --> 27:07.375
it will be my pleasure,
to deal with both of you.

27:08.958 --> 27:09.916
Dismissed.

27:21.250 --> 27:23.458
Look what we have here.

27:24.916 --> 27:27.416
- Oh, yeah. Shit.
- Bocadillos de calamares.

27:27.500 --> 27:28.375
Hey.

27:28.458 --> 27:32.833
I've never seen two people
devour more food than you and Jenny.

27:35.583 --> 27:36.625
What did Davi want?

27:37.333 --> 27:38.708
He was a waste of time.

27:38.791 --> 27:41.083
He gave me intel we already have.

27:41.166 --> 27:42.041
How is she doing?

27:42.125 --> 27:44.791
You missed all the drama here. Mm-hmm.

27:44.875 --> 27:46.166
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

27:47.250 --> 27:50.875
My boys have never
been the same since their father died.

27:51.750 --> 27:55.666
Diego especially. He took it the hardest.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.416
Because of their father,

27:57.500 --> 28:00.833
I will forgive Diego
for his rudeness today.

28:00.916 --> 28:02.958
But he owes me an apology.

28:03.041 --> 28:05.000
Losing a parent is the worst pain.

28:06.041 --> 28:08.333
Inés' boys didn't just lose a parent.

28:09.541 --> 28:10.416
They…

28:11.291 --> 28:12.166
We…

28:13.166 --> 28:14.166
We lost a hero.

28:16.541 --> 28:19.833
Eduardo and I met when we were choir boys.

28:19.916 --> 28:21.041
Yes.

28:21.125 --> 28:24.250
And we quickly
became best friends. Confidants.

28:24.333 --> 28:25.250
Brothers.

28:26.041 --> 28:28.833
He ate with us,
lived with us, married my sister.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.916
He became <i>familia.</i>

28:32.541 --> 28:36.458
Eduardo was
the most honorable man I ever met.

28:37.500 --> 28:42.458
So, to be taken away by an immigrant,

28:43.958 --> 28:46.833
who had no right
to be in this country in the first place,

28:47.958 --> 28:48.958
makes it even worse.

28:49.041 --> 28:54.083
- I don't like you talking like this.
- Then you don't like the truth, Inés.

28:55.791 --> 28:57.125
Am I wrong, Sara?

28:58.000 --> 28:58.916
No.

28:59.875 --> 29:03.541
These people come from violence
and they spread it here in our homes.

29:05.416 --> 29:06.833
Things are so different now.

29:07.875 --> 29:11.291
And I just wish
someone would do something about it,

29:11.958 --> 29:12.833
for our children.

29:12.916 --> 29:15.166
I understand you have two sons?

29:15.250 --> 29:16.458
Yes.

29:16.958 --> 29:19.833
They're still going
through the loss of their father.

29:20.333 --> 29:25.458
And, um, I'm trusting
that I'm doing the best that I can.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.291
And I pray that they will get through it.

29:30.083 --> 29:36.541
Sometimes, I feel as if
I've welcomed the strangers into my home.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.750
Even with your oldest son?

29:38.833 --> 29:39.875
Sometimes.

29:40.458 --> 29:43.083
I haven't met him.
Is he here today?

29:43.166 --> 29:47.916
No. Ramón left last night to deal with
family Business in Barcelona.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.833
I wish he were back already.

29:50.750 --> 29:53.416
My late husband's birthday
is in a couple of days

29:54.125 --> 29:57.208
and the three of us
always go to church together.

29:57.291 --> 29:58.250
Yeah.

30:00.666 --> 30:01.666
Which parish?

30:01.750 --> 30:02.708
Santa Bárbara.

30:03.291 --> 30:04.458
You should visit.

30:04.541 --> 30:08.750
Our Inés is a true believer.
She goes to mass every afternoon.

30:08.833 --> 30:11.291
I've lost enough people in my life.

30:12.416 --> 30:14.458
I can't afford to be hopeless.

30:16.125 --> 30:18.166
You don't agree, do you?

30:18.250 --> 30:21.625
It's not that. But…

30:23.583 --> 30:24.958
You remind me of someone.

30:26.166 --> 30:27.583
From a lifetime ago.

30:28.416 --> 30:29.500
A good memory?

30:32.625 --> 30:34.416
She was a dreamer too.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.625
- What's up?
- He says he'll be late.

30:39.708 --> 30:41.125
Everything okay?

30:41.208 --> 30:42.833
Yes. It's my brother, Andrés.

30:42.916 --> 30:45.125
He will be running late
tonight for dinner

30:45.208 --> 30:46.375
so we should not wait for him.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.666
I hope nothing is wrong.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.500
On the contrary, he…

30:53.791 --> 30:55.416
Let's talk in the study.

30:58.125 --> 30:59.541
- Business.
- Yes.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.166
I understand.
I should go as well.

31:03.625 --> 31:05.166
I will call you tomorrow.

31:05.250 --> 31:08.208
If my family hasn't scared you away.

31:08.791 --> 31:09.958
I can't wait.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.166
Come.

31:24.958 --> 31:26.125
This is much better.

31:27.375 --> 31:28.875
Very nice, Claire. Good.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.750
Watch that right arm, please.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.958
Come on, Claire. Show me what you can do.

31:39.875 --> 31:43.041
You're doing great,
but I've seen you go higher.

31:43.666 --> 31:44.625
Come on, Claire!

31:45.541 --> 31:46.375
She's back.

31:47.000 --> 31:47.958
For now.

31:50.583 --> 31:52.583
More confidence, Claire. Please.

31:53.583 --> 31:55.166
It's always all about her.

31:55.250 --> 31:58.625
Smile, girls. Practice is fun.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.000
Why are you so weird today?

32:09.250 --> 32:10.750
Oh, my God. Medics!

32:11.791 --> 32:13.416
Get the medics here now!

32:13.500 --> 32:15.625
Claire, it's okay. Don't worry.

32:15.708 --> 32:17.750
You're gonna be fine. Don't worry.

32:22.916 --> 32:25.416
Who is in charge
of equipment at this place?

32:26.291 --> 32:29.083
I told them to tighten the blade.

32:29.166 --> 32:30.625
Look how loose that is.

32:31.666 --> 32:33.791
She is one of my best competitors.

32:35.208 --> 32:37.375
These girls are my responsibility.

32:45.208 --> 32:46.208
That was scary.

32:46.791 --> 32:48.875
She'll be okay. It's just a broken ankle.

32:48.958 --> 32:51.291
This morning you said
you had a surprise for Claire.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.583
- Yeah.
- What was it?

32:56.125 --> 32:57.958
I just messed with her water bottle.

32:59.041 --> 33:01.083
She was gonna think somebody peed in it.

33:19.083 --> 33:20.583
I know what we have to do.

33:20.666 --> 33:24.458
We need you there when Felipe's brother,
Andrés, gets to the house tonight.

33:24.541 --> 33:28.083
The news Andrés has
I'm sure is bad for the prime minister.

33:28.166 --> 33:30.500
No doubt. I've been
working on this security system.

33:30.583 --> 33:33.250
It'll take me hours, we don't have,
to hack these cameras.

33:33.875 --> 33:36.083
We can sneak you back in as Sara.

33:36.166 --> 33:38.833
No. Sara wouldn't
be able to get into that meeting.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.333
But Diego can.

33:41.166 --> 33:44.166
You wanna morph into the messed-up kid
that everybody's pissed at?

33:44.250 --> 33:45.875
He owes Felipe an apology.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.333
And I know exactly where he is.

33:49.791 --> 33:51.416
Probably still high as a kite.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.291
And if he's sobered up?

33:54.416 --> 33:55.666
- I doubt it.

34:01.208 --> 34:05.041
And since my daughter is gonna be
too busy to stop by my room tonight…

34:05.625 --> 34:06.708
What's this?

34:06.791 --> 34:09.333
A gift from me to myself.

34:09.416 --> 34:10.666
Balenciaga?

34:12.041 --> 34:13.041
Expensive?

34:13.125 --> 34:15.583
You'll find out
when you get your credit card statement.

34:16.958 --> 34:17.875
Business expense.

34:19.166 --> 34:20.708
You got off easy. Trust me.

34:20.791 --> 34:22.625
Guys, we still have
one real issue.

34:24.125 --> 34:26.375
How do we get Jenny back up in there?

34:42.625 --> 34:44.166
Oh, shit.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.666
Literally.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.541
Take it as a good omen. Are you in?

34:48.625 --> 34:49.958
<i>Thanks. Yeah, I'm here.</i>

34:58.708 --> 34:59.625
Miura.

35:03.333 --> 35:06.166
You got a tranquilizer
in your back pocket.

35:06.750 --> 35:07.875
<i>I got you covered.</i>

35:09.750 --> 35:13.666
Don't be cocky.
Just put the damn thing to sleep. Now.

35:26.541 --> 35:30.083
Oh, she is
way out of your league, man.

35:30.166 --> 35:32.250
I'm just throwing that out there.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.208
Looks like Diego's
already partied himself out.

36:22.541 --> 36:23.916
Please.

36:29.750 --> 36:30.875
Get away!

36:31.708 --> 36:33.416
Nothing's happening.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.416
I mean, your pulse and vitals look great.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.791
I'm checking them
right now through your earpiece.

36:38.875 --> 36:41.625
<i>I know. It's all in my head.</i>

37:32.833 --> 37:34.750
Something still doesn't feel right.

37:34.833 --> 37:38.166
<i>Chris will check you out later,</i>
<i>but you're running late now.</i>

37:50.833 --> 37:52.041
Listen to me.

37:53.125 --> 37:55.958
Leave before it's too late.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.541
And take your mother.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.291
Are you fucking crazy?

38:04.375 --> 38:06.541
If you ever have a kid you'll understand.

38:19.583 --> 38:21.208
How do you like this flat?

38:22.083 --> 38:22.916
Hmm?

38:23.916 --> 38:26.041
They gave you one of the better ones.

38:26.125 --> 38:28.333
I was not this spoiled
on my first mission.

38:31.916 --> 38:33.208
Were you skating today?

38:36.166 --> 38:37.583
It's fine.

38:38.541 --> 38:41.458
You need to decompress.
We all do sometimes.

38:42.625 --> 38:44.250
Am I done with the mission?

38:48.916 --> 38:50.041
Get two glasses.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Come on.

39:01.916 --> 39:05.458
Has anyone told you
what the Yaroslav Program actually does?

39:05.541 --> 39:06.458
No.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.333
It is a biological weapon.

39:10.625 --> 39:15.500
Developed by Dr. Artur Orlov
as a byproduct of cancer research.

39:15.583 --> 39:17.333
After Chernobyl.

39:17.416 --> 39:19.375
I figured it was a weapon.

39:20.916 --> 39:23.083
Intel says it enables
human cells to mutate.

39:24.041 --> 39:27.875
If that is true, our agents
would be able to change their bodies.

39:27.958 --> 39:31.708
Like chameleons. Imagine that.

39:32.625 --> 39:34.000
You don't believe it.

39:35.791 --> 39:40.125
I believe
that if you have the chance to play God,

39:40.208 --> 39:41.583
you take it.

39:52.583 --> 39:54.625
Why are you sharing this with me?

39:56.375 --> 39:58.041
Because I tried to terminate you.

39:59.375 --> 40:01.166
And it didn't work.

40:01.250 --> 40:04.375
You and I
cannot seem to escape each other.

40:06.833 --> 40:09.000
Do you still think I'm not ready?

40:10.958 --> 40:13.666
Are you still enamored with that girl?

40:17.875 --> 40:20.208
My first mission was at the Bolshoi.

40:23.291 --> 40:27.416
It was an easy job.

40:28.583 --> 40:30.375
Even for the 16-year-old me.

40:34.708 --> 40:36.291
What did they have you do?

40:38.708 --> 40:42.166
I was a ballerina. Like my mother.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.833
And her mother.

40:46.958 --> 40:47.958
What happened?

41:07.333 --> 41:08.333
A boy happened.

41:10.291 --> 41:11.625
He betrayed me.

41:13.333 --> 41:14.666
He betrayed my trust.

41:15.958 --> 41:21.000
So… Love is not freedom, Ptichka.

41:21.791 --> 41:25.041
Real freedom only comes from raw power.

41:29.541 --> 41:33.166
You could become
the greatest spy Russia has ever known.

41:34.208 --> 41:35.625
Don't waste your chance.

41:36.875 --> 41:38.208
Do not become me.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.000
What if I'm not good enough?

41:43.708 --> 41:44.666
You are.

41:45.416 --> 41:47.000
How do you know?

41:49.541 --> 41:51.625
Because I trained you.

41:55.916 --> 41:59.958
Felipe, honestly,
I think we should cool things down a bit.

42:01.291 --> 42:02.416
I'm--

42:02.500 --> 42:05.416
I came here to say
that I'm sorry for what happened today.

42:06.041 --> 42:07.875
I'm ashamed of my behavior.

42:09.041 --> 42:10.041
I'm sorry.

42:10.875 --> 42:15.333
I had a moment of weakness,
but I'm not weak. I'm not Ramón.

42:16.291 --> 42:20.458
I'd never betray your cause or your trust.

42:22.083 --> 42:23.666
You're like a father to me.

42:25.666 --> 42:26.916
What do you say to that?

42:28.833 --> 42:32.000
I say he can crawl back to his pigsty.

42:32.875 --> 42:34.000
He's done to me.

42:37.375 --> 42:38.583
Come on, Felipe.

42:39.916 --> 42:41.750
He's having a really hard time.

42:41.833 --> 42:43.083
Give him a second chance.

42:46.333 --> 42:47.541
Come on. Play something.

42:49.458 --> 42:50.541
Go to the piano.

42:53.791 --> 42:54.666
Come on.

42:55.875 --> 42:57.333
You better play his favorite.

42:57.416 --> 42:58.875
It'll help you.

42:58.958 --> 43:02.125
<i>Oh, shit, please</i>
<i>tell me you know how to play piano.</i>

43:03.041 --> 43:03.958
Come on.

43:16.666 --> 43:18.125
Are you being difficult again?

43:20.083 --> 43:21.125
I just learned this.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.208
I wanted to surprise you
with something new.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.625
Tchaikovsky? Interesting.

43:39.708 --> 43:41.916
So you said you heard from Carmo?

43:42.000 --> 43:45.583
Yes. He says
they haven't yet found the woman,

43:45.666 --> 43:47.000
the one with Lidia.

43:47.083 --> 43:49.625
But he seems convinced
it would only be a matter of time.

43:49.708 --> 43:51.625
- Well, we handled our Business.
- Mmm.

43:52.416 --> 43:54.958
Carmo assured me that Gideon knows this.

43:55.041 --> 43:58.000
And so he says
he's got the prime minister's itinerary

43:58.083 --> 43:59.750
for the next 72 hours.

43:59.833 --> 44:00.916
He can give it to us.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.416
When?

44:02.500 --> 44:03.583
In an hour.

44:05.125 --> 44:07.416
We should send Tomás. He's ready.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.916
- Let me do it.

44:11.541 --> 44:12.791
I'll get the job done.

44:15.208 --> 44:16.208
Trust me.

44:22.625 --> 44:26.916
You…You wanted my forgiveness earlier.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.958
And now you ask for my trust.

44:32.125 --> 44:33.833
What have you done to deserve it?

44:35.583 --> 44:36.833
I could go with him.

44:38.041 --> 44:40.333
Make sure everything is handled properly.

44:46.500 --> 44:47.708
I swear to God.

44:51.166 --> 44:53.166
If you embarrass me again,

44:55.083 --> 44:56.583
if you betray us…

44:57.666 --> 45:00.333
I will end you as I did your brother.

45:02.208 --> 45:03.666
Do you understand me?

45:03.750 --> 45:05.208
I said, do you understand me?

45:08.083 --> 45:09.958
Welcome back
to the family, Diego.

45:18.875 --> 45:20.875
I know losing your brother was tough.

45:22.375 --> 45:24.541
But Felipe had no choice. Believe me.

45:25.875 --> 45:27.541
Gideon would've sensed weakness.

45:32.750 --> 45:34.791
Are we going to meet Gideon?

45:34.875 --> 45:37.416
Let's not talk about that now, Dieguito.

45:38.666 --> 45:41.250
Let's talk about us. Okay?

45:41.333 --> 45:42.375
Okay.

45:43.916 --> 45:47.000
You know, I will always protect you.

45:49.208 --> 45:51.041
I will never let Felipe hurt you.

45:53.000 --> 45:53.958
Never.

45:55.541 --> 45:57.416
I love our time together too much.

46:15.541 --> 46:16.375
Uh…

46:17.625 --> 46:19.416
God forbid, your mother finds out.

46:20.625 --> 46:22.541
It would probably kill her, you know.

46:24.291 --> 46:26.125
You should always keep that in mind.

46:27.375 --> 46:30.625
And make me happy, of course.

46:46.666 --> 46:48.916
You're still high,
aren't you?

46:51.166 --> 46:55.291
Come on. You and I both know
you have no reason to lie to me.

46:56.166 --> 46:58.750
And I knew something was off
the moment I saw you tonight.

47:00.375 --> 47:03.250
It's been… It's been really hard.

47:06.708 --> 47:08.958
Ramón meant a lot to you. I know that.

47:10.500 --> 47:13.583
But it's going to be fine,
okay? Don't worry.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.166
Wait here.

47:43.791 --> 47:45.125
Chauncey.

47:45.208 --> 47:46.916
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- Fuck!

47:47.625 --> 47:48.666
This is bad.

47:49.375 --> 47:52.291
I can't hold it. I can't hold this form.

47:55.083 --> 47:56.125
Just hang on.

47:56.208 --> 47:58.708
We're a couple minutes
away from you. Just hang on.

48:33.125 --> 48:35.208
Andrés went inside. I have to go in.

48:35.291 --> 48:38.916
<i>You need to be careful.</i>
<i>Andrés met Sara. He could recognize you.</i>

48:42.208 --> 48:44.375
He won't recognize me. Trust me.

48:49.833 --> 48:52.333
<i>Bienvenida</i> to our oasis of peace.

48:55.875 --> 48:59.250
You can change inside
and you pay on your way out.

49:00.208 --> 49:01.833
Enjoy your stay with us.

49:02.416 --> 49:04.708
This is your time to relax.

49:30.833 --> 49:31.833
I see him.

49:32.625 --> 49:34.208
I think he's talking to Gideon.

49:43.333 --> 49:44.416
Lost visual.

49:45.125 --> 49:47.083
Shit! We lost audio and visual.

49:54.250 --> 49:55.125
You again.

50:40.375 --> 50:41.541
Got eyes on Andrés.

50:42.250 --> 50:44.583
Damn. I gotta reboot this shit.

51:08.208 --> 51:09.791
I still can't hear a goddamn thing.

51:11.958 --> 51:12.916
I can.

51:14.166 --> 51:16.166
We're in trouble. We gotta fall back.

51:16.250 --> 51:17.166
Shit.

52:07.375 --> 52:09.500
I lost Gideon. I missed the drop.

52:13.750 --> 52:14.833
Chauncey?

52:18.291 --> 52:20.416
Freeze! Freeze! Don't move!

52:22.750 --> 52:23.750
Fuck.
