00:02.367 --> 00:04.596
<i>I met Frankie on July 3rd.</i>

00:04.599 --> 00:06.926
<i>But I didn't know him
as Frankie.</i>

00:06.928 --> 00:08.828
He told me his name was JD.

00:08.830 --> 00:11.830
Hey, you remember this guy
from back then... JD?

00:11.832 --> 00:13.665
You think you can, uh...

00:13.667 --> 00:15.635
just hook me up with him?

00:15.637 --> 00:17.670
<i>I can't come see you anymore.</i>

00:17.672 --> 00:19.638
That last time was a mistake.

00:19.640 --> 00:20.940
You've said that before.

00:20.942 --> 00:22.909
The court orders
an examination

00:22.911 --> 00:25.812
pursuant to
Criminal Procedure Law 730.

00:25.814 --> 00:28.448
- What does that mean?
- They need to evaluate you

00:28.450 --> 00:29.848
to see if you're fit
to stand trial.

00:29.850 --> 00:31.583
How do you know Frankie?

00:31.585 --> 00:32.851
Stop it!

00:32.853 --> 00:34.821
I'm gonna kill you!

00:34.823 --> 00:37.824
Where she hit me?
Same exact places

00:37.826 --> 00:40.126
on Frankie Belmont.
She's repeating

00:40.128 --> 00:42.695
what she did on that beach.

00:42.697 --> 00:44.667
She doesn't even know it.

Mommy?

01:21.635 --> 01:23.803
Mommy?

01:26.641 --> 01:27.839
Mommy?

01:50.965 --> 01:52.832
Oh, look,
you can see Raymond's Gulch

01:52.834 --> 01:55.635
from here.

01:58.439 --> 02:00.606
- You're like a gazelle.
- I...

02:00.608 --> 02:03.508
I think it's the Zumba.

02:09.818 --> 02:10.917
Okay, come on.

02:10.919 --> 02:11.920
Let's go.

02:13.754 --> 02:14.757
Okay.

02:16.925 --> 02:20.792
Have you ever been diagnosed
with any mental health issues?

02:20.794 --> 02:23.463
No, never.

02:23.465 --> 02:26.999
Are you taking any medication
for any mental disorders?

02:27.001 --> 02:31.804
No, because I don't have
any mental disorders.

02:31.806 --> 02:34.777
Can you define what it means
to be found guilty?

02:39.247 --> 02:41.717
Have you ever tried
to harm yourself?

02:45.652 --> 02:49.721
Sometimes I used to imagine
what it would be like, as a kid.

02:49.723 --> 02:53.429
When you picture yourself
as a kid, how old are you?

02:54.962 --> 02:56.696
I don't know.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.801
<i>13? 14?</i>

03:00.868 --> 03:03.903
And what would you say
to your 13-year-old self

03:03.905 --> 03:05.905
right now,
if you had the chance?

03:05.907 --> 03:08.006
- <i>You're killing her!</i>
- <i>You'll be right down the hall.</i>

03:10.979 --> 03:12.581
Run.

03:14.716 --> 03:18.017
Look, Harry,
it's real farm-to-table food.

03:18.019 --> 03:21.853
Pork chop, two inches thick.

03:21.855 --> 03:25.858
Perfectly cooked
in this cider jus...

03:25.860 --> 03:27.692
Man, Faye would love it.

03:27.694 --> 03:30.729
It's worth the drive.
You should try it.

03:30.731 --> 03:34.000
Didn't you drive an hour once
to try an artisanal doughnut?

03:34.002 --> 03:35.734
- Man...
- Wasn't that you?

03:35.736 --> 03:36.969
I'm not talking
about doughnuts.

03:36.971 --> 03:38.137
- I'm talking about...
- Hey.

03:38.139 --> 03:40.609
730 results on Cora Tannetti.

03:42.843 --> 03:44.911
She passed because,
technically, she should pass.

03:44.913 --> 03:47.078
She's lucid. She's aware
of her circumstances.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.815
Her judgment isn't compromised.

03:49.817 --> 03:53.786
What would you say
if I told you...

03:53.788 --> 03:57.756
that I think there was a song
that was playing on the beach

03:57.758 --> 04:00.859
and it drove her
to kill Belmont

04:00.861 --> 04:04.096
and the same song
drove her to attack me?

04:04.098 --> 04:06.666
In the interview,
the song was playing

04:06.668 --> 04:10.769
and she attacked me
in exactly the same way

04:10.771 --> 04:12.938
that she attacked Belmont.

04:12.940 --> 04:16.875
Same movements
and the same number of hits.

04:16.877 --> 04:18.779
Like she was
repeating everything.

04:20.915 --> 04:23.815
It sounds like PTSD psychosis.

04:23.817 --> 04:25.750
We see it
in combat veterans a lot.

04:25.752 --> 04:28.988
Something associated
with Cora's trauma

04:28.990 --> 04:31.757
triggers her memory
of the trauma.

04:31.759 --> 04:35.127
The memory replays
like a hallucination.

04:35.129 --> 04:36.896
To Cora, it's real.

04:36.898 --> 04:38.863
It's like it's happening
all over again.

04:38.865 --> 04:42.801
- It can be terrifying.
- So she's somewhere else

04:42.803 --> 04:46.906
and she's stabbing someone else?

04:46.908 --> 04:48.043
Possibly.

04:52.613 --> 04:54.846
Thank you very much.

04:59.987 --> 05:02.855
- Hello.
- <i>Mason?</i>

05:02.857 --> 05:05.024
Hi.
You... you okay?

05:05.026 --> 05:08.394
<i>Yeah.
Are you okay?</i>

05:08.396 --> 05:10.098
Mm-hmm.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.899
- You working?
- <i>Not today.</i>

05:14.901 --> 05:16.235
<i>The press has been
following me around,</i>

05:16.237 --> 05:17.973
<i>so I decided to stay home.</i>

05:21.709 --> 05:24.776
<i>Listen, I know you're upset,
and you have every right to be.</i>

05:26.713 --> 05:28.113
<i>But I need you
to do something for me,</i>

05:28.115 --> 05:30.685
<i>and I just hope you say yes.</i>

05:32.687 --> 05:35.154
Please bring Laine to see me.

05:35.156 --> 05:37.957
<i>It's all hitting me,
and I just need to see him.</i>

05:37.959 --> 05:39.724
I promise, I won't upset him.
I just...

05:39.726 --> 05:40.925
<i>I will.</i>

05:46.767 --> 05:48.868
Really?

05:48.870 --> 05:50.902
Yeah, yeah.
I'll take him, of course.

05:55.175 --> 05:56.944
Thank you.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.276
Mr. Lacey.

06:31.278 --> 06:32.781
Hello.

06:34.048 --> 06:35.651
Come in, please.

06:38.252 --> 06:41.156
<i>We haven't been in contact
with her for several years.</i>

06:41.889 --> 06:44.723
The whole business...

06:44.725 --> 06:48.026
- it's a shock.
- Yeah.

06:48.028 --> 06:50.899
Can I ask why you haven't been
in contact with her?

06:54.201 --> 06:58.269
Because when we...
interrogated her,

06:58.271 --> 07:01.742
she said that both
her parents were dead.

07:04.045 --> 07:09.281
Cora... chose the path
that she did.

07:09.283 --> 07:11.349
From the beginning, there was
something wrong with her.

07:11.351 --> 07:12.784
There was...

07:12.786 --> 07:14.820
Nothing we could do.

07:14.822 --> 07:17.826
When was the last time
you had contact with her?

07:19.326 --> 07:21.327
She ran away five years ago.

07:21.329 --> 07:24.163
Right around
the 4th of July, 2012...

07:24.165 --> 07:25.831
that weekend.

07:25.833 --> 07:27.533
It was her sister
Phoebe's birthday.

07:27.535 --> 07:31.036
Uh, so she was...

07:31.038 --> 07:34.072
23 then.
That's a bit old to run away.

07:34.074 --> 07:35.310
Cora was selfish.

07:37.011 --> 07:39.844
Phoebe was on death's door,
and she just left.

07:39.846 --> 07:41.380
She just... disappeared.

07:41.382 --> 07:42.947
She was only thinking
about herself!

07:42.949 --> 07:45.216
Elizabeth.

07:50.158 --> 07:54.793
Cora's sister Phoebe was sick,
since birth.

07:54.795 --> 07:58.062
She died about a month
after Cora left...

07:58.064 --> 08:00.134
of lymphoma.

08:02.836 --> 08:06.007
When Cora left,
where did she go?

08:07.408 --> 08:09.875
Did you ever file
a missing persons report...

08:09.877 --> 08:12.013
Cora died
when she left this house.

08:36.269 --> 08:39.037
Give her another hit.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.839
It'll loosen her up.

08:53.955 --> 08:55.186
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

09:05.032 --> 09:07.465
- Hold down.
- Hold down!

09:07.467 --> 09:10.401
No... no, please, no.

09:10.403 --> 09:11.970
Please, don't.

09:11.972 --> 09:13.638
Please, please.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.359
Not my arms.
Please, not my arms.

09:20.310 --> 09:24.108
The medics moved her
in here last night.

09:24.110 --> 09:27.045
She's stable now.

09:27.047 --> 09:28.180
I'll move her
to an interview room.

09:28.182 --> 09:29.884
You can talk with her there.

09:35.221 --> 09:38.556
I was off base
last time we spoke,

09:38.558 --> 09:40.691
and...

09:40.693 --> 09:42.129
I'm sorry.

09:44.965 --> 09:46.835
I heard about last night.

09:48.235 --> 09:49.837
Would you show me?

10:07.988 --> 10:10.622
Is it the same on the other arm?

10:10.624 --> 10:11.893
Can you show me?

10:21.235 --> 10:24.136
Heroin, right?

10:24.138 --> 10:27.204
When did it start?

10:29.143 --> 10:31.310
Five years ago.

10:31.312 --> 10:33.744
Before I met Mason.

10:33.746 --> 10:38.185
Was that...
after you ran away?

10:40.653 --> 10:43.622
Your parents told me.

10:43.624 --> 10:44.893
You saw them?

10:47.226 --> 10:49.026
You shouldn't believe
anything they say.

10:49.028 --> 10:53.065
They told me that you left
on 4th of July weekend.

10:53.067 --> 10:58.270
That was the same night
as your story about Frankie.

10:58.272 --> 11:00.738
Where'd you go?

11:03.243 --> 11:05.676
Dorchester.
Um...

11:05.678 --> 11:08.313
and Kingston.

11:08.315 --> 11:11.349
I was high the whole time.

11:11.351 --> 11:12.953
Who were you with?

11:15.022 --> 11:19.060
Cora, nobody gets into
this kind of stuff alone.

11:22.363 --> 11:25.262
I barely remember.
I...

11:25.264 --> 11:29.133
would sleep with guys
for fixes.

11:29.135 --> 11:32.337
So it didn't really matter who.

11:32.339 --> 11:34.406
Hmm.

11:39.812 --> 11:44.983
Please don't tell my family.

11:44.985 --> 11:48.987
Mason thinks that this is, um,
from a hospital infection

11:48.989 --> 11:51.355
that I got when I was young.

11:51.357 --> 11:53.961
His parents don't know.

11:57.197 --> 11:59.698
They will tell my son.

12:04.337 --> 12:06.671
I can't promise that.

12:06.673 --> 12:09.407
- It's my job.
- Please.

12:09.409 --> 12:10.978
I can't.

12:12.846 --> 12:16.248
I have told you
everything else.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.052
This is the only thing.

12:26.259 --> 12:28.261
I hate you.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.738
- I should've noticed them.
- No, no, no.

12:39.740 --> 12:42.741
Covered in blood...
we all missed it.

12:42.743 --> 12:45.444
Mason Tannetti...

12:45.446 --> 12:47.348
did he get her into this?

12:49.383 --> 12:51.215
No.
I mean, honestly,

12:51.217 --> 12:54.286
he was kind of a dick
in high school, but...

12:54.288 --> 12:57.155
he was never a junkie.

13:01.061 --> 13:02.697
Yeah, I gotta take this.

13:04.398 --> 13:06.297
Detective Ambrose.

13:06.299 --> 13:09.267
<i>Hey, Harry.
It's Walt over at county.</i>

13:09.269 --> 13:11.502
<i>You wanted to know when
Cora Tannetti had any visitors?</i>

13:11.504 --> 13:14.138
<i>Well, she had a new one
this afternoon.</i>

13:21.181 --> 13:23.080
Good afternoon, Ms. Lacey.
You have a visitor.

13:25.119 --> 13:26.884
Margaret Lacey?

13:26.886 --> 13:28.887
I was hoping we could talk
for a minute

13:28.889 --> 13:32.060
about your niece
Cora Tannetti.

13:33.927 --> 13:36.328
You sure I can't
offer you anything?

13:36.330 --> 13:38.199
No, I'm fine.

13:40.134 --> 13:42.267
I understand
you visited Cora today.

13:42.269 --> 13:43.435
Yes.

13:43.437 --> 13:45.237
What... was I not supposed to?

13:45.239 --> 13:49.206
No, no, it's fine.
I...

13:49.208 --> 13:51.542
"Our Town."

13:51.544 --> 13:53.447
I know that one.

13:55.515 --> 14:00.352
Look, um...
I'm trying to help your niece.

14:00.354 --> 14:04.790
Just trying to understand
what happened to her, and, uh...

14:04.792 --> 14:07.825
I'm not out to get anybody.

14:10.129 --> 14:13.464
I'm sorry.
It's just this whole thing...

14:13.466 --> 14:17.368
- very upsetting.
- So you were close with Cora.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.970
I tried to be,
over the years,

14:19.972 --> 14:23.842
but Elizabeth, her mother...
she disapproved.

14:23.844 --> 14:26.877
She has a Victorian notion
of the theater.

14:26.879 --> 14:30.248
All actresses are heathens
or prostitutes.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.316
It was easier
when Cora lived with me.

14:32.318 --> 14:34.920
When was that?

14:34.922 --> 14:37.354
When she came back.

14:37.356 --> 14:39.858
From?

14:39.860 --> 14:42.893
She disappeared in July...

14:42.895 --> 14:47.431
in 2012, but two months later,
she turned up out of nowhere

14:47.433 --> 14:49.300
at a detox center
in Poughkeepsie.

14:49.302 --> 14:50.602
In Poughkeepsie?

14:50.604 --> 14:52.270
Still doesn't make sense
to me.

14:52.272 --> 14:53.807
She never had a problem
with drugs before.

14:56.243 --> 14:59.544
So Elizabeth, when she saw
those scars on Cora's arms,

14:59.546 --> 15:02.379
she tore into her.

15:02.381 --> 15:06.517
She called her a whore.
A degenerate.

15:06.519 --> 15:08.422
She refused to take Cora in.

15:10.289 --> 15:12.425
Cora was lucky to have you.

15:17.597 --> 15:19.966
I wasn't much better
than they were.

15:22.436 --> 15:23.937
<i>There were signs.</i>

15:25.873 --> 15:28.406
I ignored them.

15:28.408 --> 15:30.407
What about that one?

15:30.409 --> 15:33.911
It was just easier
when we went for pizza.

15:33.913 --> 15:37.348
Why don't we
do something with your hair?

15:37.350 --> 15:39.017
Just for a change.

15:47.961 --> 15:49.462
This is looking better.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.434
<i>So that scar...</i>

15:56.436 --> 16:00.305
did you ever find out
how she got it?

16:00.307 --> 16:03.908
She wouldn't say.
But...

16:03.910 --> 16:05.643
she had these nightmares.

16:05.645 --> 16:07.612
Every night, just before
3:00 in the morning,

16:07.614 --> 16:11.949
she would wake up... screaming.

16:11.951 --> 16:14.451
I knew that she was hurt.

16:14.453 --> 16:16.223
I could see it in her eyes.

16:18.958 --> 16:22.594
But I didn't ask.

16:22.596 --> 16:26.263
We never ask.

16:31.504 --> 16:33.671
- You'll be right down the hall!
- No, William!

16:33.673 --> 16:36.107
She's only alive because
I'm with her every minute!

16:36.109 --> 16:38.376
- I need to be with her.
- And I need to be with my wife!

16:38.378 --> 16:40.111
- Please.
- You think this is normal,

16:40.113 --> 16:41.646
sharing a bedroom
with my daughter?

16:41.648 --> 16:43.547
- Look at her now!
- William, please, please!

16:43.549 --> 16:45.950
- Our baby's sick!
- It's not decent!

16:45.952 --> 16:47.986
Please, William... careful!

16:47.988 --> 16:50.992
Please stop.

16:52.658 --> 16:55.459
- You two will figure it out.
- I'm so sorry.

16:55.461 --> 16:57.498
I'll get you something.

17:23.156 --> 17:24.523
Where's Laine?
Is he okay?

17:24.526 --> 17:26.625
He's fine.
He's okay.

17:26.627 --> 17:28.026
- He's home. He's home.
- Okay.

17:28.028 --> 17:30.095
- He's home?
- Yeah.

17:30.097 --> 17:32.498
Okay...

17:32.500 --> 17:33.935
I don't understand.

17:37.538 --> 17:39.607
That detective came over.

17:41.542 --> 17:46.214
And... he asked me
about your drug habit.

17:48.750 --> 17:52.017
And I didn't believe him
at first.

17:52.019 --> 17:53.286
I said that she would
never lie to me

17:53.288 --> 17:54.957
about something like that.

17:57.558 --> 18:00.125
You were lying to me
the whole time.

18:00.127 --> 18:02.562
- From the very beginning.
- You never would've wanted me.

18:02.564 --> 18:04.229
- You don't know that.
- If you knew

18:04.231 --> 18:06.065
what a piece of shit I was,
you never would've wanted me.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.566
Stop.
Stop that.

18:07.568 --> 18:10.269
Was it JD?
Did he get you hooked on it?

18:10.271 --> 18:12.238
Mason, please.
Please stop with JD.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.106
I'll stop when you start
talking to me a little bit.

18:14.108 --> 18:15.211
Was it him?

18:20.281 --> 18:21.583
Nothing?

18:30.258 --> 18:32.190
I'm done.

18:32.192 --> 18:33.561
You know?

18:35.163 --> 18:37.697
I don't even feel angry
anymore.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.731
Mason, please bring
Laine to me.

18:39.733 --> 18:42.267
Why...
why should I even do that?

18:42.269 --> 18:45.837
Why should I even
do that to him? Hmm?

18:45.839 --> 18:48.141
Have you ever thought about
what he's gonna think of you

18:48.143 --> 18:49.709
when he gets older?

18:49.711 --> 18:52.644
Has that actually
crossed your mind?

18:52.646 --> 18:54.247
The fact that you pled guilty

18:54.249 --> 18:56.649
and you didn't even try
to be his mother...

18:56.651 --> 18:58.183
have you thought about that?

18:58.185 --> 19:01.054
Forget about me now.
Just think about him.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.622
- I am.
- Are you?

19:02.624 --> 19:04.623
- I don't think you are.
- Yes, I am.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.726
No, you're not.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.797
Look, can you
please talk to me a little bit?

19:11.633 --> 19:15.101
I'm sorry.

19:35.390 --> 19:36.788
Do you think Dad
is screwing Mom

19:36.790 --> 19:37.826
now that they're sharing a bed?

19:44.398 --> 19:47.266
I saw Dad naked once
in the bathroom.

19:47.268 --> 19:49.669
But I never saw his thing.

19:49.671 --> 19:51.703
I bet you did.

19:51.705 --> 19:54.207
Is it big?

19:54.209 --> 19:56.709
It's a sin to talk that way.

19:56.711 --> 19:58.614
God doesn't mind
if you're sick.

20:03.951 --> 20:06.352
Where did you get that?

20:06.354 --> 20:08.821
The nurses at the hospital
have them everywhere.

20:08.823 --> 20:11.123
I took one.

20:11.125 --> 20:12.357
There's a thing inside

20:12.359 --> 20:14.427
about anal foreplay.

20:30.711 --> 20:32.844
Read to me?

20:32.846 --> 20:34.247
Please?

20:37.951 --> 20:39.885
So I've been talking
to the DA's office,

20:39.887 --> 20:41.720
and because we're cooperating,

20:41.722 --> 20:43.155
I think we can get
a decent deal,

20:43.157 --> 20:44.824
all things considered.

20:44.826 --> 20:47.259
Possibility of parole
in 30 years,

20:47.261 --> 20:50.462
pending good behavior.

20:50.464 --> 20:52.265
What would happen
if I changed my plea

20:52.267 --> 20:54.801
to not guilty?

20:54.803 --> 20:56.736
Well, they have no incentive
to change the deal.

20:56.738 --> 20:59.872
They have an airtight case
against you.

20:59.874 --> 21:03.276
Well, what if we went
to trial?

21:03.278 --> 21:06.746
Cora...

21:06.748 --> 21:10.949
the chances of winning
a temporary insanity plea...

21:10.951 --> 21:13.318
are really, really rare.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.421
It means a long trial...
more press,

21:16.423 --> 21:17.989
your family getting dragged
through the mud,

21:17.991 --> 21:20.226
and it will get ugly.

21:20.228 --> 21:23.729
They'll dig up your past.
They'll dissect you in public.

21:23.731 --> 21:25.800
But there's a chance
that we would win.

21:29.369 --> 21:31.738
<i>She stayed here for about
two weeks as an inpatient.</i>

21:31.740 --> 21:33.842
<i>I remember she got clean
without much trouble at all.</i>

21:36.810 --> 21:38.844
Did the doctors here
treat her

21:38.846 --> 21:41.215
for her, uh, head wound?

21:42.983 --> 21:46.821
No, she was... stitched up
by the time she came in here.

21:48.355 --> 21:50.789
Is there anything else
you remember?

21:50.791 --> 21:52.859
Anything remarkable at all?

21:52.861 --> 21:54.927
Well, she definitely
wasn't like

21:54.929 --> 21:58.029
any addict
I've seen here before.

21:58.031 --> 21:59.532
How so?

21:59.534 --> 22:03.436
Well...
we're a state-run facility.

22:03.438 --> 22:06.873
We treat low-income addicts...
the homeless, but...

22:06.875 --> 22:10.343
Cora...
she was brought in clean.

22:10.345 --> 22:12.844
Hair washed, well fed,

22:12.846 --> 22:14.447
and she was wearing
brand-new sweats.

22:14.449 --> 22:16.047
I mean, she just
didn't look like

22:16.049 --> 22:18.417
someone who'd been
living on the streets.

22:18.419 --> 22:20.353
She was brought in?

22:20.355 --> 22:22.054
Yeah, someone signed
her intake form.

22:22.056 --> 22:24.489
It's Caleb Walker.

22:24.491 --> 22:26.825
There's no address,
no phone number.

22:34.501 --> 22:37.536
- Just be cool.
- I won't stay. Got it.

22:40.808 --> 22:43.843
There's JD...

22:43.845 --> 22:45.378
with the plaid jacket.

22:45.380 --> 22:49.915
<i>♪ We'll reconcile ♪</i>

22:49.917 --> 22:54.053
<i>♪ Turn off the headlights ♪</i>

22:54.055 --> 22:57.989
<i>♪ Walk into the dark ♪</i>

22:57.991 --> 23:02.998
<i>♪ And there you'll
find out who you are ♪</i>

23:04.784 --> 23:07.854
This is Lieutenant Ambrose
calling for Judge Baird...

23:08.336 --> 23:10.270
about the Tannetti hearing,
which is tomorrow.

23:10.272 --> 23:13.309
And I need her to call me back
as soon as possible.

23:15.536 --> 23:16.703
Thank you.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.832
How many Caleb Walkers
did Caitlyn find in the area?

23:21.834 --> 23:26.103
Five.
And we're narrowing it down.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.806
There we go.
<i>Uno, dos.</i>

23:30.808 --> 23:32.609
- Let's go.
- You know what?

23:32.611 --> 23:35.144
Uh... you go ahead to the car.

23:35.146 --> 23:37.213
I forgot something.
I'll meet you out there.

23:37.215 --> 23:38.681
Sure.

24:30.811 --> 24:32.613
<i>Cleanup on aisle four, please.</i>

24:39.253 --> 24:41.652
What is this doing
in your room?

24:41.654 --> 24:43.621
Answer me!

24:43.623 --> 24:46.257
Someone left it
on the sidewalk.

24:46.259 --> 24:48.392
We didn't know what it was.

24:48.394 --> 24:50.262
Cora.

24:50.264 --> 24:52.730
What is this?

24:52.732 --> 24:54.932
It's a magazine for women
with sex things in it

24:54.934 --> 24:56.834
and I looked at it
when I knew I shouldn't

24:56.836 --> 25:00.273
and I read out loud to Phoebe
about orgasms in the vagina.

25:19.793 --> 25:23.328
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

25:23.330 --> 25:26.430
I have succumbed to temptation
and practiced lewdness

25:26.432 --> 25:29.633
and encouraged
my sister Phoebe in sin.

25:29.635 --> 25:31.002
Forgive me, Father,

25:31.004 --> 25:32.437
for I have sinned.

25:32.439 --> 25:34.072
I have succumbed to temptation

25:34.074 --> 25:35.739
and practiced lewdness

25:35.741 --> 25:38.842
and encouraged
my sister Phoebe in sin.

25:38.844 --> 25:41.979
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

25:41.981 --> 25:44.716
<i>I suspect that
Mrs. Tannetti's crime</i>

25:44.718 --> 25:46.450
<i>is tied to something else.</i>

25:46.452 --> 25:48.986
It may be another crime
in which she's the victim.

25:48.988 --> 25:50.688
There's some linkages there,

25:50.690 --> 25:52.023
and something
has happened to her,

25:52.025 --> 25:53.925
and I think we shouldn't proceed

25:53.927 --> 25:55.959
until we have more information.

25:55.961 --> 25:57.897
Anything admissible?

25:59.900 --> 26:02.100
Uh, no.
Not yet.

26:02.102 --> 26:05.336
But there's quite a bit
in her testimony...

26:05.338 --> 26:09.006
Her testimony?
Are you serious, Harry?

26:09.008 --> 26:12.409
This woman is a junkie.
Junkies lie.

26:12.411 --> 26:15.746
- That's a blanket statement.
- All right, that's enough.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.114
A history of drug abuse
doesn't qualify

26:17.116 --> 26:18.949
Mrs. Tannetti
for special treatment.

26:18.951 --> 26:21.756
I'm gonna keep
the allocution as scheduled.

26:25.025 --> 26:27.492
<i>And then, after Israel,
we head to Jordan...</i>

26:27.494 --> 26:29.127
to the refugee camps.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.729
We'll be recording
the musicians there.

26:31.731 --> 26:34.799
- Mm-hmm.
- Interviews, the whole spiel.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.834
That sounds incredible...

26:36.836 --> 26:39.737
- and important.
- Mm-hmm.

26:39.739 --> 26:42.740
Faye mentioned in group
that you were working on

26:42.742 --> 26:46.076
the murder case?
The woman on the beach?

26:46.078 --> 26:48.912
Turns out,
she's a drug addict.

26:48.914 --> 26:50.515
Oh, no.
Really?

26:50.517 --> 26:52.082
See?
I told you.

26:52.084 --> 26:53.784
That makes sense.

26:53.786 --> 26:56.086
Sarah has this idea
of that woman

26:56.088 --> 26:58.390
as some kind of feminist,

26:58.392 --> 27:01.993
revenge-of-the-
millennial-housewife hero.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.062
Because I relate.

27:06.165 --> 27:08.166
Heroin or meth?

27:08.168 --> 27:09.801
It's always one or the other.

27:09.803 --> 27:12.736
- Heroin?
- Yeah.

27:12.738 --> 27:14.938
- Yeah...
- All these people,

27:14.940 --> 27:16.474
hooked on opioids.

27:16.476 --> 27:18.075
You know what
no one wants to admit?

27:18.077 --> 27:21.746
It's a class issue.
These people are uneducated.

27:21.748 --> 27:24.015
They get prescriptions
from their doctors

27:24.017 --> 27:27.955
- and they have no idea.
- Actually, you have no idea.

27:29.088 --> 27:32.157
You have no idea
who Cora Tannetti is.

27:32.159 --> 27:34.892
You don't know
what happened to her.

27:34.894 --> 27:37.861
You don't know
what she's been through,

27:37.863 --> 27:40.899
how she feels.

27:40.901 --> 27:42.833
You don't know anything.

27:42.835 --> 27:44.438
Harry?

27:46.105 --> 27:48.108
Yeah?

27:49.575 --> 27:52.512
Why don't you
go get some wine?

27:57.750 --> 28:00.921
Yeah, sure.

28:03.190 --> 28:05.924
I'm sorry I said something
about the case at dinner.

28:05.926 --> 28:10.594
I didn't realize how strongly
you felt about her.

28:10.596 --> 28:14.033
I don't.
It's nothing.

28:22.875 --> 28:23.877
Hey.

28:26.145 --> 28:29.013
If you're too tired,
we don't have to.

28:29.015 --> 28:31.149
No.

28:31.151 --> 28:32.753
You look nice.

29:24.489 --> 29:26.596
Why didn't you just
lie to her?

29:28.791 --> 29:33.937
He'd only punish us
and make you sick.

29:33.939 --> 29:38.243
Cora, God doesn't listen.

29:38.245 --> 29:40.043
Whitney at the hospital...

29:40.045 --> 29:43.680
she prayed over and over
to get better.

29:43.682 --> 29:46.316
She still died.

29:46.318 --> 29:50.254
I even prayed for you
to get sick once.

29:50.256 --> 29:53.190
Sicker than me.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.258
Just so you'd know
what it's like.

29:58.731 --> 30:01.399
Once, I ate
an entire chocolate bar

30:01.401 --> 30:03.336
because I thought
it would kill you.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.112
Do you think they're asleep yet?

30:14.114 --> 30:15.680
Why?

30:30.763 --> 30:33.430
- Body of Christ.
- The Lamb of God

30:33.432 --> 30:35.400
who takes away
the sins of the world.

30:35.402 --> 30:37.136
Amen.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.745
The blood of Christ.

30:58.758 --> 31:01.292
You have to touch it.

31:06.465 --> 31:09.002
I love you, Jesus.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.343
I love you, Jesus.

31:24.451 --> 31:27.785
And, in pursuant
to Code 730,

31:27.787 --> 31:29.453
the defendant has been found fit

31:29.455 --> 31:31.389
to stand at this allocution.

31:31.391 --> 31:34.225
So, Mrs. Tannetti,

31:34.227 --> 31:36.460
are you entering your plea
after full consultation

31:36.462 --> 31:39.330
with your attorney?

31:39.332 --> 31:41.498
- Yes.
- Do you clearly understand

31:41.500 --> 31:44.102
the nature
of second-degree murder charges

31:44.104 --> 31:46.203
and that if you plead guilty,
you are,

31:46.205 --> 31:50.775
from this point forward,
waiving your right to a trial?

31:50.777 --> 31:53.143
- Yes.
- Do you realize,

31:53.145 --> 31:54.612
in light of a guilty plea,

31:54.614 --> 31:57.215
you'll be sentenced
in two weeks' time,

31:57.217 --> 31:58.882
with no right to appeal?

32:05.125 --> 32:06.794
Mrs. Tannetti?

32:17.336 --> 32:20.371
I'm not sure.

32:20.373 --> 32:23.207
- I'm not sure what to do.
- Well,

32:23.209 --> 32:25.509
I'm afraid the time is over
for deliberations.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.815
You have to enter your plea now.

32:41.928 --> 32:45.395
Mrs. Tannetti, I'm sorry,
but you're required to...

32:45.397 --> 32:46.663
Guilty.

32:49.469 --> 32:53.203
The defendant has submitted
a plea of guilty to the court.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.305
These proceedings are concluded.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.276
The defendant is remanded.
Case adjourned.

32:58.278 --> 32:59.613
Please rise.

33:16.930 --> 33:19.263
Did you tell her?

33:19.265 --> 33:21.565
- No.
- Did you tell her?

33:21.567 --> 33:23.301
I didn't tell her.

33:23.303 --> 33:25.603
I'd never tell her.
I'd never tell...

33:28.508 --> 33:30.877
Liar.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.414
Come here.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.194
You really got me.

33:49.929 --> 33:52.496
Yeah.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.333
I got you.

33:59.572 --> 34:03.441
<i>Like a lost soul.
That's what it looked like...</i>

34:03.443 --> 34:07.948
like... someone who had
walked down the wrong street.

34:09.349 --> 34:12.983
I was just taking out the trash,

34:12.985 --> 34:16.686
<i>and there she was.</i>

34:16.688 --> 34:20.358
<i>Right over there
by the dumpster.</i>

34:20.360 --> 34:21.628
You all right?

34:29.936 --> 34:32.338
Thank you very much,
Mr. Walker.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.688

35:26.559 --> 35:30.427

35:30.429 --> 35:34.432
How do you know Cora Lacey?
Hmm?

35:34.434 --> 35:35.999
Buddy, I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:36.001 --> 35:38.635
Cora's my wife.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.072
You know what I'm saying?

35:41.074 --> 35:42.706
You mean the lady who stabbed
the guy at the beach?

35:42.708 --> 35:45.041
- You're the husband?
- Mm-hmm.

35:45.043 --> 35:47.445
Yeah, she told me about you.

35:47.447 --> 35:49.449
You understand?
I know who you are.

35:51.451 --> 35:52.552
All right.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.422
All right.

35:59.659 --> 36:01.595
She says she knows me.
What'd she say?

36:07.766 --> 36:09.602
What did you do to her?

36:11.771 --> 36:14.671
You mean she didn't tell you?

36:14.673 --> 36:16.606
Something funny?

36:16.608 --> 36:18.575
- "What did I do?"
- What are you laughing at?

36:18.577 --> 36:21.579
You don't know shit, do you?
You have no idea.

36:21.581 --> 36:23.113
You don't know.

36:23.115 --> 36:24.782
Huh?
What the fuck you smiling at?

36:24.784 --> 36:26.816
Don't you fuck with me.
Don't fuck with me!

36:26.818 --> 36:28.119
Get up and get out
of the booth.

36:28.121 --> 36:30.621
Come outside right now.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.490
'Kay.

36:32.492 --> 36:35.059
Can we be gentlemen about this?

36:35.061 --> 36:36.159
You wanna...

36:42.802 --> 36:46.070
She still like
three guys on her at once?

36:46.072 --> 36:48.405
Daddy, Daddy, and Daddy!

36:54.179 --> 36:57.180
I could get fired
'cause of you.

36:57.182 --> 36:58.816
Get in the car.

37:21.909 --> 37:23.175
I appreciate it.

37:23.177 --> 37:24.476
Last time, promise.

37:24.478 --> 37:25.744
Yeah.

37:25.746 --> 37:27.546
You got five minutes.

37:27.548 --> 37:29.916
This is over.
I don't have to talk to you.

37:29.918 --> 37:31.720
Would you sit, please?

37:37.751 --> 37:40.752
I want you to show me
how you shoot up.

37:40.754 --> 37:43.087
This is your heroin.

37:43.089 --> 37:45.923
What's the first thing
that you do?

37:45.925 --> 37:47.183
- No.
- Hey,

37:47.185 --> 37:49.919
you show me, I leave.

37:49.921 --> 37:52.054
You'll never see me again.

37:52.056 --> 37:53.823
- You're sick.
- Hey, come on.

37:53.825 --> 37:55.491
- You're the addict.
- You're a sick man.

37:55.493 --> 37:56.792
You were hooked on heroin
for two months.

37:56.794 --> 37:58.428
You got the scars to show it.

37:58.430 --> 38:00.196
You'd screw anybody
who'd give you a fix.

38:00.198 --> 38:02.031
You were zero,
you were nothing,

38:02.033 --> 38:04.670
and this is what you lived for,
so show me.

38:08.806 --> 38:11.507
Unless it was a lie.

38:11.509 --> 38:14.810
You've seen my arms, asshole.

38:14.812 --> 38:17.712
It's what happened.

38:17.714 --> 38:18.950
Prove it.

38:31.094 --> 38:33.094
What's next?

38:33.096 --> 38:35.198
The next thing you do?

38:46.578 --> 38:49.247
You don't know
how to do it, do you?

38:53.116 --> 38:55.250
Cora, addicts start
by injecting

38:55.252 --> 38:57.252
in their feet and their hands
way before

38:57.254 --> 39:00.489
their arms are scarred
like that.

39:00.491 --> 39:03.025
Five years ago,
4th of July weekend,

39:03.027 --> 39:05.261
you went out,
and then you showed up

39:05.263 --> 39:06.795
on a street in Poughkeepsie.

39:06.797 --> 39:08.964
You don't know
how you got there.

39:08.966 --> 39:11.868
You don't know
who brought you there.

39:11.870 --> 39:14.870
And you have the scars.

39:14.872 --> 39:19.174
So how much of those two months
do you actually remember?

39:28.620 --> 39:31.020
Fragments.
I'm...

39:31.022 --> 39:33.255
I'm not sure.

39:33.257 --> 39:36.893
So you believed
what your mother told you...

39:36.895 --> 39:39.194
that you sold yourself
for drugs?

39:39.196 --> 39:40.897
You had the scars,

39:40.899 --> 39:42.899
you went through
something terrible,

39:42.901 --> 39:46.134
and then you blamed yourself.

39:46.136 --> 39:49.908
You've spent
a lot of years...

39:52.076 --> 39:55.176
Blaming yourself,
haven't you?

39:55.178 --> 39:59.015
And that story
that you believed...

39:59.017 --> 40:00.549
it's not true.

40:00.551 --> 40:02.919
- But...
- None of that,

40:02.921 --> 40:05.087
that you thought
you went through, was true.

40:06.323 --> 40:09.991
Then what happened to me?

40:09.993 --> 40:11.960
I don't know.

40:14.966 --> 40:18.033
But somebody, somewhere
did this to you.
