00:26.043 --> 00:29.082
Lemonade! Sweet sunshine in your mouth!

00:29.117 --> 00:30.843
Buy a cup, or I punch my sister!

00:30.878 --> 00:33.432
It's true! He's not bluffing!

00:37.313 --> 00:39.975
Maybe we should put a dollar
in the jar, prime the pump.

00:40.010 --> 00:42.403
What are we, a piano bar?

00:45.898 --> 00:48.215
I'll take 15 lemonades.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.867
Make that 16.

00:51.032 --> 00:52.049
Lousy dog.

00:52.084 --> 00:54.819
If you had your way,
I'd walk you every day.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.332
Lemonade!

00:59.854 --> 01:01.019
- Eh!
- Stop pushing!

01:01.054 --> 01:03.816
Six cups, please. And put it on my tab.

01:03.851 --> 01:05.937
Keep moving, deadbeat. Cash only.

01:05.972 --> 01:08.272
Fine. Lemonade's for babies anyways.

01:08.307 --> 01:10.045
I'm going to Moe's, for beer!

01:10.080 --> 01:13.727
Have fun drinking your lemonade, babies!

01:18.815 --> 01:21.372
Lisa, can Daddy borrow your bike?

01:21.407 --> 01:22.489
I guess...

01:44.304 --> 01:46.086
- Hey, Moe, give me a...
- Homer, shush!

01:46.121 --> 01:48.424
We're watching Krabappel
try to break up with Skinner.

01:48.459 --> 01:52.232
Seymour, I have something
difficult I want to say to you.

01:52.267 --> 01:53.329
I understand.

01:53.364 --> 01:57.131
It can be very difficult for
a woman to propose marriage.

01:57.166 --> 01:59.398
But I am willing to
go halvsies on a ring.

01:59.433 --> 02:00.527
Seymour...

02:01.278 --> 02:02.278
Excuse me.

02:03.573 --> 02:06.369
Any of you lugs want to break
up with my boyfriend for me?

02:06.404 --> 02:07.428
I'll buy you a beer.

02:07.463 --> 02:09.668
Seymour, Edna asked me to talk to you.

02:09.703 --> 02:12.564
Splendid! Shall we discuss
music or the weather?

02:12.599 --> 02:14.752
No, this is about you.

02:14.787 --> 02:16.494
Edna wants to break up.

02:16.529 --> 02:19.065
- She wants to break up?
- Yeah.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.505
- With me?
- Yeah.

02:22.032 --> 02:26.327
Look at it this way: you're
a free man. Unlike me.

02:26.362 --> 02:28.756
You have all your hair. Unlike me.

02:28.791 --> 02:30.641
No kids tying you down

02:30.676 --> 02:33.729
or a crippling mortgage
that you refinanced at 26%

02:33.764 --> 02:36.897
because a dancing Internet
cowboy told you to.

02:36.932 --> 02:39.317
Oh, God, I hate my life.

02:41.906 --> 02:45.489
Gee, compared to you, my
life is one big half-day.

02:45.524 --> 02:49.142
Exactly. You're good looking,
you have a decent job.

02:49.177 --> 02:52.834
What lonely widow wouldn't
consider you an option?

02:52.869 --> 02:56.611
Thanks, Homer. I don't think the school
pep squad could've cheered me up more,

02:56.646 --> 03:00.128
and they were state runners up in 1997.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.614
Homer, that was amazing.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.510
He actually felt better coming out
of the breakup than he did going in.

03:05.545 --> 03:06.998
Say, Homer, you're real good at this.

03:07.033 --> 03:08.982
Think you could dump my
girlfriend Doreen for me?

03:09.017 --> 03:11.450
Doreen. She's cheated on you with everyone.

03:11.485 --> 03:14.115
Well, except for me. And
I've showered her with gifts--

03:14.150 --> 03:18.119
fancy soaps and massage
oils and, uh, what have you.

03:18.154 --> 03:21.524
Ooh, here she comes.
Work your magic, Homer.

03:21.813 --> 03:24.820
- Is Lenny here?
- Oh, I'm afraid Lenny's dead.

03:24.855 --> 03:27.433
What? I just talked to him.

03:27.468 --> 03:30.129
And you will again, because
he isn't really dead.

03:30.164 --> 03:33.494
And now this next piece
of news won't seem so bad.

03:33.586 --> 03:35.580
- Lemonade!
- We want lemonade!

03:35.615 --> 03:38.930
Don't worry, folks. Our master
chef is stirring up a fresh batch.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.050
Stop that transaction!

03:46.085 --> 03:49.140
I'm a part-time field agent with the
Springfield Department of Commerce.

03:49.175 --> 03:51.493
- Great gig.
- It is a great gig.

03:51.528 --> 03:52.994
May I see your vendor's license?

03:53.637 --> 03:56.599
Um, I think it's...
We don't have one.

03:57.221 --> 04:00.242
35 cents? Where did that come from?

04:00.277 --> 04:02.925
Can't be mine. Must be yours.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.065
I don't care if it's 45
cents, I don't want it.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.970
Submit this form to
the License Bureau.

04:08.005 --> 04:10.486
Until then, this stand is closed.

04:10.521 --> 04:11.521
Boys.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.009
Geez, I'm thirsty. You got any lemonade?

04:17.043 --> 04:18.680
Not anymore!

04:20.937 --> 04:22.475
BUREAU OF LICENSES AND PERMITS

04:22.510 --> 04:24.913
DRIVE, MARRY AND HUNT,
ONLY $49,95

04:26.661 --> 04:27.939
Come on already.

04:27.974 --> 04:30.702
Come on, come on. I was halfway through
an operation when my license expired.

04:30.737 --> 04:34.024
I'll get to you, just as soon as
I finish this crossword puzzle.

04:34.059 --> 04:35.726
Ah, no, come on.

04:35.761 --> 04:38.966
- Let's go, buddy.
- I left bananas in my car.

04:39.001 --> 04:43.246
Let's see, uh, ten across:
"Franklin Roosevelt's middle name."

04:43.281 --> 04:45.647
Excitement. Oh, wait, that don't fit.

04:47.944 --> 04:50.488
Maybe you could use some help.

04:52.427 --> 04:54.624
"FDR's middle name": "Delano."

04:54.659 --> 04:56.452
"Oxidized surface":
Well, that's "rusty."

04:56.487 --> 04:58.125
"Bartenders serve them 'dirty.'"

04:58.160 --> 05:00.349
- Ham sandwiches!
- No, "martinis."

05:00.384 --> 05:01.416
Oh, right.

05:01.451 --> 05:04.460
One more word! "Singer
of Yentl," 13 letters.

05:07.253 --> 05:10.035
I got it! "Isaac Bashevis!"

05:10.228 --> 05:13.303
Now, give me my license!
Give everyone their license!

05:15.527 --> 05:17.649
Whoo, what is a
four-letter word for "hero"?

05:17.684 --> 05:20.250
- "Hero."
- Yes, but I meant "Lisa."

05:20.285 --> 05:23.417
- Lisa!
- Lisa!

05:24.667 --> 05:26.005
- Y'ello.
- Homer?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.821
It's your old roommate, Grady.

05:27.856 --> 05:30.145
- The gay guy?
- That's not all I am!

05:30.180 --> 05:31.980
Well, it's a lot of what I am.

05:32.015 --> 05:35.126
Any-hoo, I heard how good you
are at breaking up couples.

05:35.161 --> 05:37.089
I need your help to break up with Julio,

05:37.124 --> 05:41.440
'cause I met someone new, someone
much more cool and refreshing.

05:43.150 --> 05:46.983
Got it. Marge, I'm going
to a hardcore gay club,

05:47.018 --> 05:49.246
and I won't be home
till 3:00 in the morning!

05:49.281 --> 05:50.504
Have fun!

05:55.395 --> 05:56.976
Ay carumba!

05:57.534 --> 06:00.129
Bart, I've fallen in
love with crosswords.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.612
It finally happened. You've
gone completely fruit loops.

06:03.647 --> 06:07.523
"Fruit Loops." That's the answer
to 38 down: "Toucan's delight."

06:07.558 --> 06:09.315
No, I mean you're loco in the co.

06:09.350 --> 06:12.031
- "Cocoa": "Ice rink drink."
- You're losing it!

06:12.066 --> 06:14.322
"Losin' It": "Risque '80s teen flick."

06:14.357 --> 06:16.254
Fine, go nuts, see if I care.

06:16.289 --> 06:18.513
"Eye care":"Optician's concern."

06:18.548 --> 06:20.480
Oh, thanks for your help, Bart.

06:20.515 --> 06:23.637
"Bart": "San Francisco people mover."

06:23.672 --> 06:25.653
Speaking of San
Francisco people mover....

06:30.527 --> 06:32.883
Grady is breaking up with me?!

06:32.918 --> 06:36.340
You'll always have a
special place in his heart!

06:36.375 --> 06:37.375
In his what?

06:42.272 --> 06:44.857
Oh, baby, you are the breakup king.

06:44.892 --> 06:49.567
You-You have made the seven minutes that I'm
gonna go without love so much more bearable.

06:49.602 --> 06:52.794
Anyone else want me to get
rid of that special someone?

06:52.829 --> 06:56.280
Okay, everyone, rotate one to your right.

07:02.804 --> 07:05.477
Guess what, Mom. I'm a cruciverbalist.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.629
Another religion?

07:07.664 --> 07:10.423
You know, you're just gonna drop the
whole thing when you go to college and

07:10.458 --> 07:12.242
get a Jewish boyfriend.

07:12.277 --> 07:17.245
Probably. But a cruciverbalist is a
fan of crossword puzzles, which I am!

07:17.280 --> 07:21.343
Me, too! I been doing them since 1958.

07:21.378 --> 07:24.229
Back then, we called
them Alphabet Hotels,

07:24.264 --> 07:27.195
'cause every letter
gets its own little room.

07:28.475 --> 07:32.183
I still do the Springfield
Shopperpuzzle every day.

07:32.719 --> 07:33.943
Let's see there.

07:34.107 --> 07:36.939
Grampa, everyone knows that
the only real test of skill

07:36.974 --> 07:39.747
is the New York Timespuzzle,
edited by Will Shortz.

07:39.782 --> 07:41.649
"Will" and
"shorts"--

07:41.684 --> 07:45.121
two things I'm no longer
allowed to change by myself.

07:52.226 --> 07:54.801
Okay, back to the real world.

08:09.365 --> 08:12.512
- Isn't it beautiful?!
- Sure is.

08:12.547 --> 08:14.482
- Who's driving the bus?
- What bus?

08:16.356 --> 08:18.778
<i>Sweet Conclusions
Breakup Service.</i>

08:18.813 --> 08:22.107
Oh, yes, we dispose of
your loved one humanely,

08:22.142 --> 08:24.576
thanks to our patented

08:34.899 --> 08:37.215
MARRY ME, MISS HOOVER

08:39.111 --> 08:42.580
MARRY ME, MISS HOOVER

08:42.615 --> 08:44.639
SHE WANTS TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE

09:00.550 --> 09:03.866
SNAKE + GLORIA
4NEVER

09:09.298 --> 09:10.736
Simpson!

09:10.771 --> 09:15.108
What in the blue blazes are you
doing to my hopscotching grids?

09:15.143 --> 09:17.397
I- I made them into a crossword.

09:18.116 --> 09:20.966
Well, I'm a bit of a puzzle head myself.

09:21.001 --> 09:25.922
They, uh, help me wind down after
a day of dealing with Skinner!

09:25.957 --> 09:27.785
- You called?
- Made reference.

09:27.820 --> 09:28.933
My mistake.

09:29.322 --> 09:32.317
Lisa, I think you
might be ready for this.

09:32.352 --> 09:34.689
"Bald Man's Basketball League"?

09:35.102 --> 09:37.670
Hmm? Sorry, wrong flier. I meant this.

09:37.705 --> 09:39.901
"Citywide Crossword Tournament"?

09:39.936 --> 09:42.276
- Oh, thank you!
- Ah, you're welcome.

09:42.311 --> 09:45.818
Now, uh, I have to go home and
make sure my pool boy is using his

09:45.853 --> 09:47.627
skimmer!

09:47.662 --> 09:49.472
- You called?
- You misheard.

09:49.507 --> 09:50.705
My mistake.

09:53.079 --> 09:56.240
Marge, if I had a hundred dollars
for every customer I'd broken up,

09:56.275 --> 09:59.202
I'd have exactly this amount.
'Cause that's what I charge.

10:00.224 --> 10:03.927
Homie, I'm not sure about
this new business of yours.

10:03.962 --> 10:06.359
You're making it too easy for couples to break up

10:06.394 --> 10:08.376
just because they hit a rough patch.

10:08.411 --> 10:12.481
I know this is hard on you. But in time,
you'll come to see it's for the best.

10:12.516 --> 10:15.900
That's one of your breakup lines!

10:15.935 --> 10:19.323
What would have happened if there
was someone who could break us up

10:19.358 --> 10:23.946
every time I had my doubts about you?

10:37.582 --> 10:39.401
Who are you?

10:39.436 --> 10:43.215
We are the spirits of the
relationships you killed.

10:48.204 --> 10:51.140
We're the babies those
couples would have had.

10:52.099 --> 10:55.628
And we're the antiques those
couples would have bought together.

10:58.747 --> 11:00.900
Get him, chairs and babies!

11:06.218 --> 11:07.218
Homie?

11:07.253 --> 11:09.056
Marge, I'm getting out
of the breakup business.

11:09.091 --> 11:11.792
And I don't know if I'll
ever sleep soundly again!

11:11.827 --> 11:13.385
Well, maybe...

11:14.433 --> 11:16.073
TODAY:
CROSSWORD CHAMPIONSHIPS

11:16.108 --> 11:17.750
TOMORROW:
GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY

11:25.547 --> 11:27.450
Wow, so this is what this is.

11:27.485 --> 11:30.439
Cruciverbalists from far
and wide have gathered here

11:30.474 --> 11:33.032
for a no-holds-barred
test of skill.

11:33.067 --> 11:36.498
- Surely some holds are barred.
- No, none.

11:36.533 --> 11:41.150
Well, it sounds really exciting,
and you're a delightful young lady.

11:41.185 --> 11:43.216
Now if you'll excuse me.

11:45.855 --> 11:47.552
Hey, what's going on?

11:47.587 --> 11:50.366
It's kind of a secret, so
shut the door most of the way.

11:54.287 --> 11:56.346
We found a way to make
this tournament interesting.

11:56.381 --> 11:58.916
We bet on the matches.

11:59.057 --> 12:02.295
Really? Well, I did bring
this envelope full of money.

12:02.330 --> 12:05.399
And these days, betting in a
bar is safer than any stock,

12:05.434 --> 12:07.385
bond or real estate investment.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.161
Agreed. So, who are you gonna bet on?

12:09.196 --> 12:12.391
I want you to put it
all on my little girl.

12:12.426 --> 12:14.461
And parlay with the Asian kid.

12:14.496 --> 12:16.618
- He has a name, you know.
- What is it?

12:16.653 --> 12:18.144
I don't know. He's not my kid.

12:21.722 --> 12:23.486
- I win!
- She won!

12:23.521 --> 12:27.361
And like any prudent gambler,
I know when to walk away: never!

13:10.959 --> 13:13.570
Okay, everybody, take a break.

13:13.605 --> 13:16.113
Dad, I could actually win this thing!

13:16.148 --> 13:18.987
And when you win, I win.

13:20.879 --> 13:22.708
I'll explain that to
you on your deathbed.

13:22.743 --> 13:25.619
My only fear is I always sabotage myself

13:25.654 --> 13:27.319
when I'm on the verge of happiness.

13:27.354 --> 13:28.913
- You what?
- In my young life,

13:28.948 --> 13:32.476
I've seen that every time I'm
about to achieve true happiness,

13:32.511 --> 13:35.683
some little piece of me says,
"You don't deserve this."

13:35.718 --> 13:38.394
And another little
piece says, "I agree."

13:38.429 --> 13:40.696
Right, right. But will it happen this time?

13:41.080 --> 13:44.646
With my luck, I bet it will. It's practically a sure thing.

13:47.879 --> 13:49.581
Contestants to your boards.

13:49.616 --> 13:52.205
- Wish me luck.
- Just be yourself.

13:53.163 --> 13:56.784
I want to change my bet. I'm
going against my daughter.

13:57.715 --> 14:01.993
I'll take your money, but
I won't look you in the eye.

14:02.028 --> 14:04.631
Fine. I won't look you in the eye.

14:09.042 --> 14:11.116
- Have I made the bet yet?
- I got it.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.584
We're down to our final two contestants.

14:13.619 --> 14:16.784
But before they compete, we would
like to pay tribute to all the words

14:16.819 --> 14:19.557
that have been removed from
the dictionary in the past year.

14:20.251 --> 14:23.419
SKEDADDLE

14:23.591 --> 14:26.537
NIXONIAN

14:27.002 --> 14:29.884
ZOUNDS

14:30.800 --> 14:33.381
MIMEOGRAPH

14:34.577 --> 14:36.957
HOOTENANNY

14:39.250 --> 14:43.358
You know, my wife Shirley, she's
the real crossword ace in our family.

14:43.393 --> 14:45.857
Fills in those letters
fast as hail on a tin roof:

14:45.892 --> 14:47.676
ping-ping-ping, she's done.

14:48.312 --> 14:51.685
Ah, Shirley passed away two years
ago, but I'm still not over it.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.595
Aw, that's so sad.

14:53.630 --> 14:56.093
Hey, what can you do? Life
keeps changing the music,

14:56.128 --> 14:58.380
but you gotta keep up
the cha-cha-cha, huh?

15:05.192 --> 15:07.939
Let's see, I'll spread some Qs around.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.528
That'll get my brain going.

15:12.218 --> 15:17.432
Oh, I dropped my glasses. Oh,
Shirley, baby, I let you down.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.713
Hey, there are no lenses in these glasses.

15:24.748 --> 15:27.526
Let's see, that's "Enrico Fermi", and
there you've got the "Pet Shop Boys,"

15:27.561 --> 15:31.353
and cross the T and zing the Z and
skit-skat skoodily I'm all the way home.

15:34.610 --> 15:36.300
Lisa got hustled.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.239
Oh, I blew it again.

15:40.274 --> 15:41.584
She blew it again.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.571
Here's your money... drenched
in your daughter's tears.

15:45.606 --> 15:49.229
You know, for a bartender-bookie, you're awfully judgmental.

15:55.445 --> 15:57.441
Boy, Dad seems awfully happy.

15:57.476 --> 15:59.740
And there's something
different about him.

16:02.033 --> 16:05.471
He bought new shoelaces
with fancy metal tips.

16:09.340 --> 16:12.010
Dad, did you come into some
money we don't know about?

16:13.301 --> 16:16.423
- No.
- You got highlights in your hair!

16:16.689 --> 16:18.449
Uh... the sun did that.

16:18.484 --> 16:21.956
And your car antenna has been
straightened and re-balled.

16:22.950 --> 16:24.264
What's going on?

16:26.104 --> 16:28.926
Well, sweetie, Daddy
made a little extra money

16:28.961 --> 16:31.200
betting against you in
the crossword tournament.

16:31.235 --> 16:32.809
You'll understand when you're a parent

16:32.844 --> 16:35.588
placing large wagers against your own children.

16:35.623 --> 16:37.633
I hope you're not mad.

16:39.731 --> 16:41.532
No, I'm not mad.

16:47.369 --> 16:49.247
You sure you're not mad?

16:49.282 --> 16:51.834
No. I'm not mad.

16:54.331 --> 16:56.191
You sure you're not mad?

16:56.226 --> 16:58.465
No, I'm not mad.

16:59.494 --> 17:02.610
Mr. Teddy, can you
ask Lisa if she's mad?

17:02.645 --> 17:04.190
What's that, Mr. Teddy?

17:04.224 --> 17:06.031
You're saying that you know women,

17:06.066 --> 17:09.587
and that when women say they're
not mad, they're madder than ever?

17:09.622 --> 17:11.890
Oh... she's gone.

17:11.925 --> 17:14.565
Can you drive me home?
I'm a little drunk.

17:15.839 --> 17:16.839
Lisa?

17:17.471 --> 17:18.471
Lisa?!

17:20.513 --> 17:23.333
Lisa, sweetie, please
look at your Daddy.

17:23.696 --> 17:27.103
You stopped being my Daddy
as soon as you bet against me!

17:27.137 --> 17:31.419
All I have now is a mom, which
is why I'm taking her maiden name!

17:31.454 --> 17:34.637
From now on, I'm Lisa Bouvier!

17:38.477 --> 17:40.549
Hey, Mr. S. Lisa B.

17:41.256 --> 17:44.131
No...!

17:44.166 --> 17:46.182
Would you like to buy some band candy?

17:46.217 --> 17:48.557
Yes...!

17:49.542 --> 17:51.628
Lisa's mad at me, and now she's using

17:51.663 --> 17:54.742
Marge's maiden name instead of mine.

17:54.777 --> 17:56.586
Homer, whatever you
done to that little girl,

17:56.621 --> 17:59.089
you just gotta do something
even nicer to win her back.

17:59.124 --> 18:00.566
She may never take back your name,

18:00.601 --> 18:02.872
but there's still a chance
she'll take you back as a Daddy.

18:03.587 --> 18:08.744
Wow, nobody gives better parenting
advice than childless drunks.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.433
So the name "Lisa
Simpson" is available, huh?

18:12.026 --> 18:14.771
Lotta goodwill attached to
that name. I gonna take it.

18:15.987 --> 18:18.047
Lisa's Tavern, Lisa speaking.

18:24.778 --> 18:26.081
Lisa, sweetie,

18:26.116 --> 18:29.656
I'm honored that you chose my
name, but it's not that great.

18:29.691 --> 18:33.292
Back in high school, the boys
used to call me Marge "Boobier."

18:33.327 --> 18:36.103
Hey, Bouvier was Jackie
Kennedy's maiden name.

18:36.138 --> 18:38.415
Really? I never knew that.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.947
What did you think her name
was before it was Kennedy?

18:40.982 --> 18:43.533
Jackie "O." Like SpaghettiOs.

18:43.568 --> 18:46.022
I thought that was where
her money came from.

18:46.057 --> 18:50.529
Look, why don't you cheer up by doing
a New York Times crossword puzzle, huh?

18:50.564 --> 18:51.902
I'm through with crosswords.

18:51.937 --> 18:55.365
My innocence died in
those 441 little boxes.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.426
It might be a fun way
to kill a couple hours.

18:58.461 --> 19:03.097
A couple hours? I can do the
Sunday puzzle in less than one hour.

19:04.449 --> 19:05.925
A couple of hours.

19:06.533 --> 19:10.152
43 MINUTES LATER
Last clue: "Loses on purpose."

19:11.975 --> 19:12.975
Diets!

19:14.164 --> 19:17.272
Oh, Will Shortz, you clever rascal.

19:17.307 --> 19:19.789
And a new record time.

19:19.824 --> 19:20.826
Wait a second.

19:20.861 --> 19:23.773
"Dumb Dad Sorry For His Bet."

19:23.808 --> 19:27.316
Wow, it's almost as if
Dad planted that message.

19:27.351 --> 19:30.740
No, it must just be a weird coincidence.

19:30.775 --> 19:32.399
But what if it's not?

19:32.434 --> 19:33.837
Oh, it must be.

19:33.872 --> 19:34.872
Or mustn't it not?

19:46.608 --> 19:48.234
Dad, I know this is crazy,

19:48.269 --> 19:51.581
but did you plant a message to me in
the New York Times crossword puzzle?

19:51.616 --> 19:54.198
Well, I had a little help from this guy.

19:55.306 --> 19:58.544
New York Times Crossword Editor Will Shortz!

19:59.244 --> 20:02.114
And master puzzle
constructor Merl Reagle!

20:02.149 --> 20:03.759
I actually wrote that crossword.

20:03.794 --> 20:07.011
And I edited it. Now
get back to crosswording!

20:07.046 --> 20:08.613
Yes, sir.

20:08.784 --> 20:11.844
Well, I must admit, I'm kind of touched.

20:11.879 --> 20:14.279
"Dumb Dad Sorry For His Bet."

20:14.314 --> 20:15.559
Nice.

20:15.594 --> 20:17.878
You didn't get Homer's
whole message, Lisa.

20:17.913 --> 20:19.165
- I didn't?
- Take a look

20:19.200 --> 20:21.418
at the first letters of all the clues.

20:25.045 --> 20:26.970
<i>Dear Lisa,</i>

20:27.005 --> 20:29.384
<i>you make me so happy</i>

20:29.930 --> 20:32.984
<i>really, really, really happy.</i>

20:33.019 --> 20:36.021
<i>Sorry, they told me
I needed 144 letters</i>

20:36.056 --> 20:37.966
<i>What was my point again?</i>

20:38.001 --> 20:39.394
<i>Oh, right.</i>

20:39.429 --> 20:41.503
<i>Bouvier or Simpsons</i>

20:41.538 --> 20:44.024
<i> I cherish you,</i>

20:44.398 --> 20:45.850
Oh, dad.
