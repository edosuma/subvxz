WEBVTT

00:11.846 --> 00:13.264
Get over here!

00:38.122 --> 00:40.624
Look. What do you see?

00:42.126 --> 00:44.837
Papa.
The scorpion! It needs help.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.965
Life is cruel, Satoshi.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.217
It doesn't care where you are from,

00:50.676 --> 00:52.178
what god you pray to.

00:52.762 --> 00:56.015
It is. So, you must face it head-on.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.142
See the scorpion?

00:59.477 --> 01:02.772
No matter how many enemies,
it continues on.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.940
It is strong. Yes.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.650
It is fast.

01:07.276 --> 01:10.154
But do you know
why the scorpion is feared?

01:12.364 --> 01:13.657
Its will.

01:18.496 --> 01:21.624
Willpower is what makes
your destiny your own.

01:21.832 --> 01:25.169
Learn to be strong, here and here.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.088
Promise me you'll remember that.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.840
I will, Papa.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.760
Now let's get home.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.764
Your mother is making dinner
and she won't be happy if we're late.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.268
Hold on.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.813
Faster, Papa! Faster!

01:49.151 --> 01:50.236
More!

01:52.071 --> 01:53.405
Your papa needs a break.

02:22.852 --> 02:24.436
Where is everyone, Papa?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.063
Hold tight, Satoshi.

03:57.988 --> 03:58.864
Harumi.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.272
Harumi.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.192
Harumi!

04:36.151 --> 04:36.986
Mama...

06:59.336 --> 07:00.170
Enough!

07:10.889 --> 07:13.225
Come further and he dies.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.646
What do you want?

07:19.565 --> 07:20.732
On your knees.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.839
If you touch a hair on his head...

07:45.632 --> 07:46.550
Papa!

07:51.013 --> 07:52.055
Papa...

07:54.933 --> 07:55.976
Satoshi!

07:56.727 --> 07:57.936
Satoshi!

07:59.855 --> 08:00.939
Papa.

08:06.403 --> 08:07.571
Satoshi.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.823
Satoshi!

08:10.699 --> 08:11.825
Satoshi!

08:15.662 --> 08:16.997
I'll kill you!

08:17.456 --> 08:18.790
I'll kill you!

08:39.061 --> 08:41.647
You'll die for this.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.148
You first.

10:10.652 --> 10:11.653
Lord Raiden!

10:12.779 --> 10:13.613
I'm sorry. I...

10:14.448 --> 10:15.282
I didn't know.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.118
No. You did well, Liu Kang.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.828
Just as you were taught.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.998
And now, I pray it is enough.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.376
Enough?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.420
Then it is time.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.505
Yes. Do not worry.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.633
We have prepared for this moment
for a long time.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.345
I chose you for a reason, Liu Kang.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.890
Now, the others will be gathering.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.350
We must hurry.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.353
Lord Raiden. What others?

10:46.688 --> 10:48.231
No, no. Listen...

10:48.982 --> 10:50.942
we can make this work. I promise.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.070
What do I have to do? Huh?

10:53.570 --> 10:56.114
How 'bout cleaning this hell hole
you call a home?

10:56.239 --> 10:59.701
How 'bout doing something besides
crying about your career?

10:59.785 --> 11:01.286
You only care about yourself.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.455
It's all about Johnny Cage.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.165
Call me when you grow up!

11:10.921 --> 11:14.007
So... I can still call her then.

11:14.383 --> 11:15.217
That's a W.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.287
Hey! You're in the Cage with Johnny.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.999
Oh, well.
If it isn't my long-lost agent.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.251
It's about time you called.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.671
Well, of course
I'm interested in something different.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.297
What have I been telling you, yeah?

11:54.923 --> 11:56.466
China? Uh-huh.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.845
All right, Will. What about an advance?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.513
Things have gotten a little...

12:01.888 --> 12:03.807
little tight around here--

12:05.684 --> 12:07.310
Hello? Hello?

12:08.353 --> 12:10.397
Well, I'm off to China!

12:32.169 --> 12:33.587
Kick him in the face!

12:43.472 --> 12:46.433
You gonna keep crying like a bitch
or fight like a man?

13:03.575 --> 13:05.327
Yeah, yeah. That's right.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.704
This is no place for a little girl.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.790
This is no place for a little girl.
This is no place for a little girl.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.293
This is no place for little girls.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.254
Do you think this is funny?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.131
Congratulations, Cadet.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.593
You've just become my new pet project.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.306
You think you're pretty special,
don't you, princess?

13:26.890 --> 13:29.392
Sir! My name is Sonya Blade,

13:29.476 --> 13:33.146
and I'm gonna be
the best soldier you've ever met, sir!

13:33.563 --> 13:35.023
We'll see about that.

13:36.358 --> 13:37.692
You wanted to see me, sir?

13:38.109 --> 13:39.236
Yes, I did.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.404
I'm puttin' together a task force.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.240
High-level spec-op stuff.

13:43.865 --> 13:44.950
Are you in?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.459
I'm gonna kill you!

13:55.210 --> 13:56.836
You're gonna try.

14:03.552 --> 14:04.636
Yeah!

14:10.016 --> 14:11.226
That's my car!

14:15.522 --> 14:17.065
Not yet, whore.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.703
My teeth! My teeth!

14:29.869 --> 14:31.871
Honestly, it's an improvement.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.040
Oh, shit!

14:47.470 --> 14:50.223
Sonya! Sonya! Sonya!

14:59.024 --> 15:00.150
He'll be there.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.068
If he's not,

15:02.152 --> 15:04.863
there's nowhere on Earth
you'll be able to hide from me.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.239
Understand?

15:30.221 --> 15:31.306
Satoshi.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.891
Harumi!

15:34.392 --> 15:35.685
What is this?

15:35.977 --> 15:37.062
Where am I?

15:49.282 --> 15:52.285
Don't start without me.

15:53.536 --> 15:57.666
Ah. Fresh meat.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.924
What in the hell?

16:06.675 --> 16:07.801
Close.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.387
Netherrealm.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.851
It's no use.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.146
You are a prisoner here.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.025
For how long?

16:27.821 --> 16:29.698
Forever.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.909
Listen.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.749
Ah.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.419
Do you hear it?

16:42.794 --> 16:44.963
The symphony of pain.

16:45.588 --> 16:49.217
Your voice will soon join the others,

16:49.384 --> 16:53.930
rising up to please the great Shinnok.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.433
Shinnok?

16:56.766 --> 16:59.602
The master of Netherrealm.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.855
There.

17:02.522 --> 17:07.109
The only place of reprieve
in this realm.

17:07.861 --> 17:11.990
Look on it and weep.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.458
Sharp enough.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.720
Calm yourself.

17:33.928 --> 17:38.099
Save your energy
for what is about to come.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.274
Now you see?

17:46.733 --> 17:49.068
You'll feel pain,

17:49.319 --> 17:52.655
though you can no longer perish.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.366
We can do this

17:55.575 --> 17:59.120
for all eternity.

18:03.958 --> 18:04.959
Huh?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.086
What is it you say?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.133
Is that a prayer?

18:13.343 --> 18:18.306
No. No god can help you here.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.558
I need no god.

18:40.078 --> 18:45.250
I will take pleasure in
ripping your flesh from your bones!

19:17.824 --> 19:19.242
Human.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.287
You have made a big mistake.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.628
There are thousands of us

19:30.962 --> 19:32.839
and only one of you.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.431
Minus one.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.345
Shinnok!

20:21.804 --> 20:25.558
No. Shinnok is indisposed.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.810
Then go fetch him for me.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.437
If only I could.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.648
I am Quan Chi,

20:31.731 --> 20:33.775
in charge of this realm

20:33.858 --> 20:35.693
until the master's return.

20:35.944 --> 20:39.197
And who do I have to thank
for ruining my rug?

20:39.656 --> 20:41.282
Hanzo Hasashi.

20:41.366 --> 20:44.494
Your reputation precedes you,
Hanzo Hasashi.

20:44.786 --> 20:45.912
Welcome.

20:46.037 --> 20:49.415
Though, I'm not entirely sure
how you made it here.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.794
What is it you want, Hanzo?

20:52.919 --> 20:54.587
To return home

20:54.671 --> 20:56.798
to seek my revenge.

20:57.006 --> 20:57.840
Home?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.136
You can't return home.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.474
You will do as I say

21:06.599 --> 21:08.810
or I will flay you alive.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.444
Did you think me defenseless, dog?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.989
In my realm, no less.

21:22.407 --> 21:24.450
You may be a vengeful spirit,

21:24.909 --> 21:27.453
but even they have their limits.

21:42.135 --> 21:46.472
Besides, that's not what
you really want, is it?

21:48.558 --> 21:51.185
Once a generation,
there is a tournament.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.730
During that time,

21:53.896 --> 21:55.648
the veil is lifted,

21:55.815 --> 21:59.318
so that warriors may gather
to fight on behalf of their realm.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.279
I can send you there.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.907
Why would I fight for you?

22:05.742 --> 22:09.162
Because, he will be in attendance.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.584
What do you want?

22:15.752 --> 22:20.381
Good. Skilled and smart.

22:22.550 --> 22:25.636
Long ago, my master, Shinnok,

22:25.720 --> 22:28.056
was unjustly imprisoned.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.975
This is the key to his release.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.936
It's being kept at
the temple of Shang Tsung,

22:34.062 --> 22:35.772
the putrid mortal

22:35.855 --> 22:38.649
that has the favor
of the emperor of Outworld.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.778
The tournament will
take place on his island.

22:42.236 --> 22:43.988
Get me that key.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.075
Once my master is released,

22:47.200 --> 22:49.077
he can return your family,

22:49.327 --> 22:52.747
even you, back to the mortal realm.

22:53.456 --> 22:56.334
Do we understand each other, Hanzo?

22:59.003 --> 23:00.797
Hanzo is dead.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.924
Call me Scorpion.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.726
Hold the boat! I'm comin'.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.526
Comin' through. I'm...

23:22.693 --> 23:24.779
Whoa, whoa.

23:25.446 --> 23:26.781
Hmm.

23:29.909 --> 23:30.785
Hmm?

23:37.166 --> 23:39.168
Hope no fans saw that.
I'm wearing slip-ons.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.884
Liu Kang of the White Lotus Society.

23:46.968 --> 23:49.053
Johnny Cage of the superstar variety,

23:49.178 --> 23:50.805
but you probably knew that.

23:51.514 --> 23:52.849
And you are?

23:53.766 --> 23:54.934
Not interested.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.811
Oh, you will be.

23:56.894 --> 23:57.979
They always are.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.689
So, you guys in this thing, too?

24:00.398 --> 24:03.151
Yes. I have trained many years
for this moment.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.694
Oh, yeah? Listen.

24:04.986 --> 24:06.571
I love acting classes and all,

24:06.654 --> 24:08.865
but they're really kind of a time suck.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.449
You know what I mean? No?

24:10.533 --> 24:13.202
Anyway, my agent said this would really
put me back on the map.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.496
Kind of a back-end deal-type thing.
Should be fun.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.415
We are approaching the veil.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.295
Who's that? Let me guess.
He's kinda like our Merlin?

24:22.795 --> 24:24.130
That is Lord Raiden,

24:24.380 --> 24:26.048
Protector of Earthrealm.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.718
Boom! Nailed it. Wait. Earthrealm?

24:28.801 --> 24:30.511
Did you guys get
a script already or somethin'?

24:30.595 --> 24:31.721
Look, I'd love a copy.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.598
I've no idea what you're talking about,

24:33.723 --> 24:36.434
but I am pretty good
at improv, so, uh...

24:37.768 --> 24:38.978
Lord Raiden, right?

24:39.729 --> 24:40.771
Good to meet you.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.733
So, tell me more about this veil.

24:44.192 --> 24:45.985
The space between realms

24:46.194 --> 24:49.488
to prevent Outworld
from merging with Earthrealm.

24:49.697 --> 24:50.823
Prevented by what?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.450
Always the soldier.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.285
Evaluating risks.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.997
What guards the veil
is of less consequence

24:58.122 --> 24:59.540
than why it does so.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.792
If Shao Kahn wins this tournament,

25:01.918 --> 25:05.338
Earth as you know it
will cease to exist.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.964
Not to fear, Lord Raiden.

25:07.048 --> 25:08.382
I, Johnny Cage,

25:08.591 --> 25:11.135
will make sure that Earthrealm, so dumb,

25:11.219 --> 25:12.845
will be safe from harm.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.764
You have my word on it.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.065
Lord Raiden, these are
the champions you gathered?

25:24.148 --> 25:25.983
You doubt my choices?

25:26.150 --> 25:27.818
No. I just meant...

25:27.944 --> 25:30.863
You see only what is
in front of you, Liu Kang.

25:31.239 --> 25:33.199
But your eyes deceive you.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.660
It is what is inside that matters.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.203
Sonya Blade,

25:37.536 --> 25:39.705
a most formidable warrior.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.416
She has had
to prove herself against many

25:42.500 --> 25:44.252
who thought she was nothing more

25:44.460 --> 25:46.087
than a weak girl.

25:46.629 --> 25:49.674
Believe me, she is anything but.

25:49.799 --> 25:50.800
And him?

25:50.967 --> 25:52.677
He only seems to be
concerned about himself

25:52.760 --> 25:54.470
- and material wealth.
- One, one, one!

25:55.304 --> 25:57.306
- Come on.
- That will keep him alive

25:57.556 --> 26:00.476
until he finds something more
to care about.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.562
Something greater than himself
to live for.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.189
Are you kidding me?

26:05.356 --> 26:08.150
I paid extra for international
and I can't even get a signal.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.777
Raiden, are you getting one?

26:15.449 --> 26:16.951
What in the...

26:22.581 --> 26:23.749
Stay in the vessel.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.835
It is under Lord Raiden's protection.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.546
Out there... is nothing good.

26:28.796 --> 26:31.549
Oh. Right. Paparazzi.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.218
We've arrived.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.132
Look.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.311
That must be the bad guy.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.650
One at a time, everybody. One at a time.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.694
Brought enough for everyone. Okay.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.237
Where'd you guys put my trailer?

27:35.321 --> 27:37.239
I'd like to freshen up
before we start shooting.

27:37.823 --> 27:38.824
Ugh.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.330
He has no idea what he's doing.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.623
Should we tell him?

27:46.040 --> 27:48.250
His journey is one of discovery.

27:48.751 --> 27:51.420
Besides, I find it amusing.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.811
Remember our deal, Scorpion.

28:37.007 --> 28:37.842
Whoa.

29:18.299 --> 29:19.758
Be on guard.

29:19.842 --> 29:22.386
Shang Tsung is not to be trusted.

29:22.595 --> 29:24.346
Oh, look, craft services. Great!

29:38.277 --> 29:39.904
Hmm.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.323
Hey. Do you know if
any of this stuff is organic?

29:43.407 --> 29:45.409
Just askin'. Jeez.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.752
Now is your chance.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.031
In the beginning

30:24.448 --> 30:26.200
were the Elder Gods.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.286
In their wisdom,

30:29.370 --> 30:31.288
they created a tournament

30:31.372 --> 30:33.249
to safeguard each realm

30:33.332 --> 30:36.001
from the threat of invasion.

30:36.085 --> 30:37.586
Once a generation,

30:37.920 --> 30:40.339
the finest warriors must do battle

30:40.422 --> 30:42.800
to decide the fate of their realm.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.678
The winner will be granted long life

30:45.761 --> 30:47.680
and great power.

30:47.763 --> 30:51.016
If one realm wins the tournament
ten times,

30:51.308 --> 30:53.811
they will have the right
to merge with the other

30:53.978 --> 30:56.230
and rule as they see fit.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.607
I, Shang Tsung,

30:59.108 --> 31:01.443
emissary of the great Shao Kahn,

31:01.652 --> 31:03.654
emperor of Outworld,

31:04.321 --> 31:06.574
winner of the last nine tournaments

31:06.657 --> 31:08.284
against Earthrealm,

31:08.617 --> 31:12.121
welcome you to Mortal Kombat.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.497
Yeah!

31:13.581 --> 31:15.332
Mortal Kombat!

32:02.296 --> 32:05.716
Now, as host of this tournament,

32:05.799 --> 32:08.052
I think it only fitting

32:08.135 --> 32:11.388
that I provide you
with some... entertainment.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.357
Kano.

32:28.947 --> 32:29.907
Jax!

32:40.959 --> 32:42.169
Jax!

32:43.921 --> 32:45.422
Listen, you son of a bitch.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.174
You better open this...

32:47.341 --> 32:48.634
whatever it is,

32:48.717 --> 32:52.137
or I'm gonna use your ass
as my own personal punching bag.

32:52.429 --> 32:53.764
Oh, that is so hot.

32:58.060 --> 33:00.062
- Princess.
- Asshole.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.730
I told you to wait for me.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.023
I got excited.

33:03.357 --> 33:05.943
You got caught by that idiot Kano.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.028
Yeah. That too.

33:09.238 --> 33:13.283
Unless you want me to rip that
pencil-thin mustache off your face,

33:13.617 --> 33:16.704
I think it's best
you let me go, old man.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.330
Absolutely.

33:18.706 --> 33:21.041
You are free to leave at any time.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.168
The doorway is right there.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.338
Of course,

33:26.672 --> 33:28.882
you have to get past my champion.

33:31.301 --> 33:35.347
Goro! Goro! Goro!

34:02.499 --> 34:04.042
What the hell?

34:22.186 --> 34:23.562
Jax! No!

34:23.645 --> 34:24.772
Relax, kid.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.190
I've got this.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.065
All right, ugly.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.319
You wanna dance? Let's dance.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.388
I wouldn't.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.142
Let me guess.

35:02.476 --> 35:06.355
Quan Chi promised you life
if you would do his bidding.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.774
Ah. No.

35:08.982 --> 35:11.527
Not you. Someone else.

35:11.735 --> 35:12.903
Someone you lost.

35:13.403 --> 35:15.697
Someone you care about.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.909
Do you think Quan Chi
is a man to be trusted?

35:18.992 --> 35:20.869
What choice do I have?

35:21.286 --> 35:22.704
We all have choices.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.456
Live in the past,

35:24.665 --> 35:26.583
or live for the future.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.962
The key won't solve your problems.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.839
It will, however,

35:32.172 --> 35:33.632
create new ones.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.509
And my revenge?

35:35.592 --> 35:38.554
Revenge is too heavy a burden to carry.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.264
You are a free man.

35:40.681 --> 35:42.850
It's time you start acting like it.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.536
Get him!
Come on! You can do better.

36:25.392 --> 36:26.643
Really, Goro.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.520
You shouldn't play with your food.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.624
Stop it! You'll kill him!

36:48.749 --> 36:50.375
That's the idea.

36:50.918 --> 36:52.044
Finish him.

37:00.928 --> 37:01.845
No!

37:12.230 --> 37:13.649
Fake.

37:14.107 --> 37:16.026
These special effects suck.

37:20.155 --> 37:21.239
Enough!

37:32.084 --> 37:34.586
You forget yourself,
Lord Raiden.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.381
You are not to interfere
in the tournament.

37:37.547 --> 37:40.050
I was unaware the tournament had begun.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.773
We are here for Mortal Kombat,

37:55.607 --> 37:57.693
not your barbarism.

37:59.236 --> 38:01.571
As you wish. Kano!

38:05.826 --> 38:09.496
Jax! Hold on! I'm comin' for you.

38:09.663 --> 38:10.956
You hear me?

38:11.123 --> 38:12.332
No matter what,

38:12.416 --> 38:14.167
I'm comin' for you.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.503
Wow. She's great.

38:16.670 --> 38:19.131
I mean, that is
some serious method acting, there.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.048
Am I right?

38:23.051 --> 38:26.221
I can see we're all anxious
to get started.

38:27.139 --> 38:27.973
Good.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.976
I have determined your opponents

38:31.143 --> 38:33.353
and where on the island you will fight.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.314
Let Mortal Kombat begin.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.704
Uh...

38:50.787 --> 38:52.706
Okay? That was weird.

38:52.873 --> 38:54.583
Did someone slip me something,

38:54.875 --> 38:56.668
or... Holy shit!

39:00.630 --> 39:01.465
Hello?

39:01.965 --> 39:04.426
Sonya? Lord Regan? Radar?

39:04.509 --> 39:05.427
Whatever your name is.

39:07.763 --> 39:09.598
This thing better not
go straight to video.

39:26.656 --> 39:27.491
Gunpowder?

39:27.699 --> 39:30.160
Must be some sort of old fortress.

39:43.632 --> 39:44.466
Bingo.

39:54.601 --> 39:55.727
Hard as a fossil.

39:55.811 --> 39:57.729
No craft services, no trailers...

39:57.813 --> 39:59.856
My agent is gonna hear about this
when I get home.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.319
Sheesh!

40:06.154 --> 40:06.988
Hello?

40:08.156 --> 40:09.866
I should at least get a per diem.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.246
Oh, hey. How's it goin'?

40:14.746 --> 40:17.290
That... that is one hell of a costume.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.756
Uh, are we live?

40:24.881 --> 40:26.842
Like... Like... you wanna do this now?

40:31.972 --> 40:33.932
Whoa. Buddy! Pro tip.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.767
Next time, pop a few mints.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.065
Whoa! Whoa!

40:42.190 --> 40:44.568
Go easy! We haven't even run parts.

40:46.987 --> 40:49.573
Hey! Asshole! That was custom.

40:49.906 --> 40:50.740
Dick!

40:53.827 --> 40:55.370
That and this!

40:59.666 --> 41:01.501
And barrel!

41:57.140 --> 41:58.433
Eat me, buttercup.

42:14.574 --> 42:15.784
Toasty.

42:54.698 --> 42:55.740
Come on!

42:55.824 --> 42:57.325
Face me like a man.

43:24.436 --> 43:26.604
All right, asshole.
Let's see what you got.

44:28.416 --> 44:29.751
Not so fun now, is it,

44:29.876 --> 44:31.544
you cold-blooded bastard.

44:33.797 --> 44:34.631
Heads up!

44:39.552 --> 44:41.096
Fuck with the Blade,

44:41.179 --> 44:43.181
you're gonna get cut.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.085
You move like the Shirai Ryu,

45:12.293 --> 45:13.920
but they are dead.

45:14.295 --> 45:16.423
Who are you? What do you want?

45:17.048 --> 45:18.508
Revenge.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.973
Tell me, Lin Kuei scum.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.142
Where is Sub-Zero?

45:31.521 --> 45:34.441
Die knowing I will kill

45:34.524 --> 45:37.944
every last member of the Lin Kuei
on this island.

45:38.111 --> 45:41.448
Every last one.

46:00.467 --> 46:03.094
You are Raiden's chosen one?

46:03.386 --> 46:06.222
No wonder your realm
has lost so many tournaments.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.650
I do not wish to hurt you.

46:17.984 --> 46:19.360
Spare me your pity.

46:31.789 --> 46:32.999
Do not get up.

46:34.083 --> 46:37.253
I take no pleasure
in hurting such a worthy foe.

46:37.378 --> 46:38.546
But know this.

46:38.630 --> 46:40.131
I will do whatever it takes

46:40.215 --> 46:42.675
to defend Earthrealm
and win this tournament.

46:44.219 --> 46:45.803
Then you are a fool.

46:46.012 --> 46:48.223
Shao Kahn cannot be defeated.

46:48.681 --> 46:50.058
He will take your world

46:50.141 --> 46:53.144
and you will bow your knee
like countless others before you.

46:53.269 --> 46:54.437
I promise you,

46:54.562 --> 46:57.106
I will never bow before that madman.

47:00.026 --> 47:01.152
I yield.

47:04.531 --> 47:06.908
What makes you so sure you will win?

47:07.408 --> 47:10.453
Because I have something
no one in Outworld has.

47:10.787 --> 47:12.664
- What?
- Hope.

47:30.515 --> 47:32.183
Impressive, Raiden.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.520
Your warriors have made it further
than I would've thought.

47:35.645 --> 47:38.606
They are strong in spirit, Shang Tsung.

47:39.023 --> 47:41.192
You will not win today.

47:41.442 --> 47:44.028
I have heard such promises before.

47:44.737 --> 47:49.158
Thankfully, after Goro kills
whomever makes it to the final round,

47:49.617 --> 47:51.703
I will not have to hear them again.

47:52.287 --> 47:53.830
And Quan Chi,

47:54.455 --> 47:56.249
your warrior from Netherrealm,

47:56.791 --> 47:59.002
he's proving to be quite formidable.

47:59.127 --> 48:01.129
For the glory of Outworld,

48:01.421 --> 48:04.215
I serve at the pleasure of Shao Kahn.

48:05.508 --> 48:06.593
Indeed.

48:07.010 --> 48:08.344
You won't succeed.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.598
No matter how many foes you put between
the Earthrealm fighters

48:11.723 --> 48:13.558
and your champion,

48:13.641 --> 48:15.393
they will make it to the end.

48:15.727 --> 48:16.728
Oh.

48:17.353 --> 48:19.230
I'm glad you feel that way.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.108
Surely, you know of the Black Dragon.

48:22.817 --> 48:25.528
It seems that several
have made it onto the island

48:25.612 --> 48:28.072
with orders to kill
your Earthrealm friends.

48:28.531 --> 48:30.575
How dare you!

48:31.284 --> 48:34.037
Are you accusing me
of something, Lord Raiden?

48:34.120 --> 48:36.873
You brought them here
to interfere with the tournament.

48:36.956 --> 48:38.583
And break the rules?

48:38.916 --> 48:40.918
Even I am not so bold

48:41.002 --> 48:43.546
as to anger the Elder Gods
in such a way.

48:44.505 --> 48:47.133
You will not succeed, Shang Tsung.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.761
We'll know soon enough, won't we?

49:03.024 --> 49:03.900
Ah.

49:03.983 --> 49:06.694
What I wouldn't give
for a frozen margarita.

49:11.407 --> 49:13.576
Hey! Really?

49:14.202 --> 49:16.537
I know. Look at this shirt.
It's ridiculous.

49:16.663 --> 49:17.997
I'm glad to see you, though.

49:18.373 --> 49:20.458
Okay. You won't believe this,

49:20.625 --> 49:22.669
but this isn't some sort of movie.

49:22.752 --> 49:24.045
This is the real deal.

49:24.170 --> 49:26.381
Maybe a snuff film or something.
I don't know.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.132
But I had to fight some, uh...

49:28.299 --> 49:29.884
I don't even know what it was.

49:30.009 --> 49:31.427
I barely got out alive.

49:32.053 --> 49:33.429
I can believe that.

49:33.513 --> 49:35.556
Listen, I'll get you out of here,

49:35.640 --> 49:37.016
but we'll need to stick together.

49:37.100 --> 49:39.519
First rule of combat
is to secure our position.

49:39.977 --> 49:42.605
Let's find somewhere to hole up
and then we can start recon.

49:42.730 --> 49:44.774
Find out where we are,
what we're up against.

49:44.899 --> 49:45.983
A sound strategy.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.736
You both made it. Good.

49:48.903 --> 49:50.655
I fear it's only gonna
get harder from here.

49:50.738 --> 49:52.782
Whoa. Wait.
What's gonna get harder?

49:52.907 --> 49:55.743
I just fought a walking pair of teeth
on the side of a mountain.

49:55.952 --> 49:57.412
I'm not Tom Cruise, you know.

49:57.704 --> 49:58.538
I act.

49:58.955 --> 50:01.249
I leave that stunt shit
for the stunt people.

50:01.541 --> 50:03.835
Listen, sweetheart.
We should get out of here--

50:04.335 --> 50:06.421
My dick!

50:06.504 --> 50:08.965
Fuck balls! No one touches me
without permission.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.633
- You got it?
- Got it.

50:10.717 --> 50:12.135
You said you knew where we were?

50:12.218 --> 50:13.094
I do.

50:13.261 --> 50:14.637
But it will be dark soon.

50:14.887 --> 50:16.931
We need to make camp. Rest.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.141
Agreed.

50:22.437 --> 50:25.565
No, no. Don't wait for me. I'm fine.

50:25.732 --> 50:28.693
Let me just pee out some blood first.

50:43.624 --> 50:45.460
What the fuck?

50:48.337 --> 50:49.589
I think I'm gonna be sick.

50:54.427 --> 50:55.344
Stay behind me.

50:55.470 --> 50:56.554
I'll take care of this.

50:56.637 --> 50:58.431
What is this, 1950?

50:58.556 --> 51:00.057
Step back, Bruce Lee.

51:00.183 --> 51:01.517
Bring it, bitch.

51:01.601 --> 51:02.435
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:02.518 --> 51:04.520
Everyone just chillax. Okay?

51:04.687 --> 51:06.355
No one needs to fight anyone,

51:06.439 --> 51:09.192
especially some guy that
just went psycho on a bunch of, uh...

51:09.275 --> 51:11.569
Black Dragon. Mercenaries.

51:11.944 --> 51:14.489
Assassins. Bad guys.

51:14.572 --> 51:15.907
Yeah. Those guys.

51:15.990 --> 51:17.033
We have to continue.

51:17.158 --> 51:19.076
Once Mortal Kombat has been declared,

51:19.160 --> 51:20.203
it must be finished.

51:20.369 --> 51:22.830
Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

51:22.914 --> 51:24.791
- Did you?
- Nope.

51:24.916 --> 51:27.752
Well, what about you, Mr...

51:28.002 --> 51:29.295
Scorpion.

51:29.378 --> 51:31.172
Oh. It's catchy. I like that.

51:31.297 --> 51:32.590
Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

51:33.841 --> 51:37.845
Good. Good. Great.
Then no one needs to die. Sheesh.

51:39.889 --> 51:42.016
Now, who's hungry?

51:48.523 --> 51:50.149
I know you didn't
believe it before,

51:50.483 --> 51:51.484
but it's all true.

51:51.651 --> 51:54.153
The Elder Gods,
the tournament, everything.

51:54.612 --> 51:55.780
Emperor Shao Kahn

51:55.905 --> 51:58.157
has won nine previous
Mortal Kombat tournaments.

51:58.449 --> 51:59.450
If he wins a tenth...

52:00.618 --> 52:01.452
Then what?

52:01.828 --> 52:03.913
Then you all die.

52:04.580 --> 52:06.499
Great. Just great.

52:06.582 --> 52:10.336
Yeah. Okay.
Monsters, magic, this can't be real.

52:10.419 --> 52:12.380
Somebody must've slipped something
into my drink.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.631
I'm hallucinating.

52:13.714 --> 52:14.757
Get a grip, Johnny.

52:15.341 --> 52:17.635
Whatever this is, it's real.

52:17.885 --> 52:20.137
There's no use sitting around
and whining about it.

52:20.805 --> 52:22.557
If what Liu Kang says is true,

52:22.640 --> 52:24.141
then the whole world is in trouble,

52:24.225 --> 52:25.726
and we have to stop it.

52:26.519 --> 52:28.062
If I can get to a radio,

52:28.604 --> 52:30.022
the communications array,

52:30.106 --> 52:31.482
I can call in reinforcements.

52:31.607 --> 52:34.068
Turn this island
into the next cautionary tale.

52:34.944 --> 52:37.113
If only it were that easy.

52:37.405 --> 52:39.407
- Lord Raiden.
- You.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.243
What do you mean,
"If only it were that easy"?

52:42.493 --> 52:44.787
Do you know what
a Hellfire missile can do?

52:45.037 --> 52:47.331
I'm sure it's very powerful on Earth,

52:47.832 --> 52:50.251
but we are not on Earth.

52:50.960 --> 52:54.630
This island lives
in a place between realms,

52:54.797 --> 52:57.967
a place set aside specifically
for the tournament.

52:58.092 --> 53:00.052
Uh-huh. Sure. Sounds great.

53:00.136 --> 53:02.722
So, if what Liu Kang says is true,

53:02.930 --> 53:05.975
then you're really
some sort of god, right?

53:06.100 --> 53:07.977
I have been given many names.

53:08.185 --> 53:09.520
Well, shoot, Buddha.

53:09.645 --> 53:11.272
Snap your fingers, get us home.

53:11.355 --> 53:14.025
I am done with
psycho monsters and bad food.

53:14.150 --> 53:15.109
And by the way,

53:15.192 --> 53:18.237
I'll never complain about
doing a sequel again in my life.

53:18.487 --> 53:19.322
He cannot.

53:19.739 --> 53:22.408
Lord Raiden is forbidden from
interfering in the tournament.

53:23.117 --> 53:25.036
It is a bargain he made
to save Earthrealm

53:25.119 --> 53:26.787
from being taken over eons ago.

53:26.996 --> 53:29.248
Well, that's... That's insane.

53:29.373 --> 53:31.250
The fate of the world is being decided

53:31.334 --> 53:33.377
by some sort of karate tournament?

53:33.461 --> 53:34.545
Are you kidding me?

53:34.629 --> 53:37.757
You are the only hope left
for Earthrealm.

53:37.965 --> 53:39.258
Head toward the temple

53:39.383 --> 53:41.469
where your final battles await.

53:42.178 --> 53:44.722
And your destinies will be made clear.

53:44.889 --> 53:46.140
But be on guard,

53:46.390 --> 53:47.934
there are others on this island

53:48.017 --> 53:50.561
who will try to keep you
from the final round.

53:55.608 --> 53:58.277
Great. So, uh, we are screwed.

53:58.694 --> 54:01.572
If Lord Raiden believes we can make it,
we can.

54:01.739 --> 54:03.824
No. You can't.

54:04.450 --> 54:07.578
Well, you seem very fun, Mr. Scorpion.

54:07.703 --> 54:09.497
Shang Tsung has the numbers.

54:09.705 --> 54:12.249
He has that... monster.

54:12.833 --> 54:16.379
Go. Hide in the jungle until it is over.

54:16.754 --> 54:18.631
And let Earth be destroyed?

54:18.798 --> 54:21.175
Sorry, pal. I took an oath to defend it

54:21.300 --> 54:22.510
no matter the odds.

54:22.677 --> 54:24.261
He would not understand, Sonya.

54:24.345 --> 54:25.763
Someone such as him

54:25.888 --> 54:28.099
has never known
anything worth dying for.

54:30.393 --> 54:32.228
You cannot survive.

54:32.395 --> 54:34.021
My will is strong.

54:34.355 --> 54:36.482
My destiny is my own.

54:39.026 --> 54:41.654
You are as naive
as you are doomed.

54:42.113 --> 54:44.115
I've waited here too long.

54:44.365 --> 54:46.659
Know that the next time we meet,

54:46.784 --> 54:49.120
it will not end well.

54:50.538 --> 54:52.540
Well, that was cheery.

54:52.665 --> 54:53.874
Shut up, Botox.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.711
I'm just sayin',
he really killed the vibe around here.

54:56.794 --> 54:58.379
I was just--

55:00.006 --> 55:01.757
Shutting up. Yeah. Yeah.

55:02.049 --> 55:03.634
Scorpion was right about one thing.

55:03.843 --> 55:05.136
We've rested long enough.

55:05.386 --> 55:06.679
We must continue on.

55:12.018 --> 55:12.852
I've found them.

55:23.237 --> 55:26.032
So, we're here. Now what?

55:32.580 --> 55:34.999
Oh. Great. This is fair.

55:35.082 --> 55:37.251
The rules state that
it must be single combat.

55:37.460 --> 55:39.670
These lads aren't here
for the tournament.

55:39.837 --> 55:41.464
They've been paid to kill you.

55:41.797 --> 55:42.631
Hello, love.

55:43.382 --> 55:45.259
Nice to see you again.

55:46.844 --> 55:49.388
Why don't you come over here
and I'll give you a hug.

55:49.638 --> 55:51.640
Well, you'd do a better job than Jax.

55:57.438 --> 55:58.981
I guess Raiden was wrong.

55:59.106 --> 56:00.066
Oh. Ya think?

56:00.149 --> 56:02.985
No. Stay together.
We'll survive. We have to.

56:03.069 --> 56:04.612
Yeah. We better.

56:04.695 --> 56:06.739
I need to make it home
so I can kill my agent.

56:15.414 --> 56:16.624
Be ready.

56:16.791 --> 56:17.625
For what?

56:57.790 --> 56:59.959
You see? I knew he liked us.

57:09.844 --> 57:10.970
Stay down!

57:11.053 --> 57:12.346
I know how to fight.

57:19.061 --> 57:20.187
Sure you do.

57:20.271 --> 57:21.856
Just stay down.

57:24.942 --> 57:26.610
Oh, man, is she hot.

58:25.669 --> 58:26.503
Down!

58:33.344 --> 58:34.220
Yeah!

58:36.222 --> 58:38.057
Huh? What gives?

58:38.182 --> 58:40.434
You dishonor this tournament.

58:53.822 --> 58:55.991
You will die
for what you did.

59:35.531 --> 59:37.074
That's for my clan!

59:38.158 --> 59:40.202
This is for my wife!

59:43.205 --> 59:46.292
And this is for my son!

01:00:10.316 --> 01:00:11.191
Screw it.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:12.901
He's not paying me enough for this.

01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:13.819
Kano!

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:16.989
Go. Save your partner.

01:00:17.323 --> 01:00:18.157
Sonya!

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.284
Partner?

01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:22.578
Raiden said your destiny would be clear.

01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:25.080
So, there she is.

01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:25.998
You know what?

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:28.459
I guess I don't mind
having my balls crushed.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.544
By her, I mean.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:31.920
Doesn't make it any better.

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:49.563
I'm disappointed.

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:53.359
I brought you here for one purpose

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:56.111
and you have failed me.

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:59.198
You're as weak as your wife was.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.617
As your child.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:04.703
Yes, you fool.

01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:07.414
It wasn't Sub-Zero at all.

01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:10.209
I killed them.

01:01:10.626 --> 01:01:11.919
It was easy.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:15.005
I used sorcery to hide my identity.

01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:19.051
To make the Lin Kuei do as I wanted.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.806
You are strong, Scorpion,

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.392
but not immortal.

01:01:26.475 --> 01:01:28.268
I think I'll leave you here.

01:01:28.811 --> 01:01:31.188
Just like I left your son.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.732
To be eaten by the birds.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:43.450
Papa.
The scorpion! It needs help.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:46.078
Do you know
why the scorpion is feared?

01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:47.996
Its will.

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:01.176
Come on, Sonya, darling.

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:02.803
Just a bit further.

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:04.555
Jax!

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.014
Sonya?

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.142
I'm so glad you made it.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:09.560
It's gonna be a joy

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.895
to watch you end up like your partner.

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:20.821
You think I'm afraid of you?

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.448
Bring it on!

01:02:44.887 --> 01:02:45.929
Oh, fuck.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:48.098
Shang Tsung!

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:51.268
Ah. I'm impressed, Raiden.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:53.437
You were right.

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.314
He has great spirit.

01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:57.649
And even greater skill.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:02.154
Please. We both know
yours is a lost cause.

01:03:02.738 --> 01:03:03.906
Goro!

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:17.294
I'll make you a deal, Liu Kang.

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:21.131
Yield, and Shao Kahn
will grant you mercy.

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:23.133
You can come to Outworld.

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:24.676
Live as a king.

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:27.679
We shall show you every pleasure.

01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:31.099
Is that how Shao Kahn
got you to betray your world?

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:33.519
I am not as weak as you, Shang Tsung.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:37.231
Then you shall die. Fight!

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:00.671
Poor Raiden.

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:05.342
It must be awful to watch
your beloved chosen one die

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:08.345
and be unable to do anything about it.

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:10.931
The fight is not over yet.

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:12.474
It may as well be.

01:04:12.558 --> 01:04:14.309
Quan Chi, goblets.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.980
Let us toast to
our emperor's impending victory.

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:19.731
Splendid idea.

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:29.575
Come now, Liu Kang.

01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:31.577
You can do better than that.

01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:35.163
For Outworld.

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.207
For Shao Kahn.

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:49.094
Now, finish her!

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.437
Here's Johnny!

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.110
Johnny?

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:07.404
Don't worry, babe. I got this.

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:14.119
All right, boys.

01:05:14.202 --> 01:05:16.204
Picture's up. Roll sound.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.042
And... action.

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:35.891
Impossible!

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:38.018
Holy shit.

01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:40.145
Johnny Cage can fight.

01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:42.314
Save some for me.

01:05:45.317 --> 01:05:47.069
I told you you'd come around.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:48.236
Ugh.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.488
Well done.

01:06:31.822 --> 01:06:34.282
Truly, I underestimated you.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.119
But I am bored now.

01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:40.038
Goro. Playtime is over.

01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:06.273
Kano!

01:07:06.565 --> 01:07:07.399
Stay back!

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.401
I'll slit his throat.

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:45.395
Wait a minute.

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:52.110
Now we can go.

01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:12.047
Yes. Yes!

01:08:12.214 --> 01:08:13.715
You see, Quan Chi,

01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:15.008
the key to winning

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:18.636
is always being
a few steps ahead of your enemies.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.268
Did you think I didn't know

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:27.604
you'd betray your emperor, Quan Chi?

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.064
You're mistaken.

01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:30.023
I would never...

01:08:35.362 --> 01:08:37.531
All for what? This?

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:41.701
He's been imprisoned
for a reason, Quan Chi.

01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:45.412
Your sad devotion to the mad god Shinnok

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:48.124
makes you as pathetic as he is.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.377
Soon, Earthrealm will be Shao Kahn's,

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:54.089
and his destiny will be complete.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:57.968
It's too bad
you won't live long enough to see it.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.511
Finish him.

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:11.857
Does it hurt?

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:27.037
Soon, your weak species will be no more.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:48.018
Who dares?

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:52.939
Scorpion.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:56.943
Impossible.

01:09:57.152 --> 01:10:01.323
It would seem I underestimated
your champion, Quan Chi.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:05.452
You are Scorpion of Netherrealm, yes?

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.372
You have killed Goro.

01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:14.210
Thus, you must take your rightful place
as the champion of Outworld.

01:10:14.336 --> 01:10:17.255
I want nothing
to do with your game.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.549
I've come for him.

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:23.428
Interesting.

01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:25.805
Defeat Liu Kang

01:10:26.014 --> 01:10:29.184
and you can have Quan Chi
to do with as you wish.

01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:31.311
Defeat Liu Kang,

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:35.190
and my emperor will give you
all that you dream of.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.693
Vengeance is not the way, Scorpion.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:40.195
Of course it is.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.738
And it's yours.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.157
All you have to do

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.117
is kill him.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:06.346
Good. Good.

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:10.225
What choice did he really have,
Lord Raiden?

01:11:11.685 --> 01:11:14.104
There's always another choice.

01:11:20.402 --> 01:11:22.404
Now, fight!

01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:31.371
What are you doing?

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.498
Living for the future.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:35.792
Give me the key.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:39.963
You fool!

01:11:40.088 --> 01:11:43.174
Shao Kahn will hear about this
and kill you.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.884
I'm already dead.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:47.178
Liu Kang, I yield.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.138
No!

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:51.808
Then the tournament is finished.

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:53.435
Outworld has lost.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.895
Earthrealm is safe.

01:11:57.772 --> 01:12:00.525
I will kill you all.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.236
The tournament is over, Shang Tsung.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:07.532
I am no longer bound by rules
of non-interference.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.784
Return to your emperor.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:11.661
Tell him of your failure.

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.372
You have made a mistake, Lord Raiden.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:18.251
Emperor Shao Kahn will have his revenge.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.669
I'm counting on it.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:21.504
No.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:26.342
Without Shang Tsung's power,

01:12:26.426 --> 01:12:27.761
the island will collapse.

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.596
We must go.

01:12:30.722 --> 01:12:31.765
What about Scorpion?

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.767
His path lies elsewhere.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:35.060
- But--
- Now!

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:39.439
I knew you would survive.

01:12:39.606 --> 01:12:41.900
I chose you for a reason.

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:43.777
Give me the key

01:12:43.902 --> 01:12:47.655
and we can leave this place
before it is destroyed.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:49.199
Come take it.

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:51.326
Like you did my family.

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:54.746
Very well.

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:55.830
But, please,

01:12:55.914 --> 01:12:59.584
put up more of a fight
than your wife did.

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:24.609
I'm going to finish the job
my demons couldn't.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:28.571
Die, you wretched vermin!

01:13:36.955 --> 01:13:38.957
It's time to die.

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:41.709
Indeed.

01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:01.521
Liu! Lord Randy!

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:02.814
Need a lift?

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:20.558
Get over here!

01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:29.442
My god will avenge me.

01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:32.320
Damn your god.

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:15.446
So... is that it? Did we win?

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:16.364
For now.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.866
All right! Yeah!

01:16:19.826 --> 01:16:21.536
Uh, may I?

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:27.500
All right! Yeah! Mmm.

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:29.919
Cinnamon.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.297
Mmm. Yeah. Pat me there.

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.673
Doesn't mean I'm gonna break the hug.

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.216
- That's enough.
- Okay.

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:37.760
Think she'll ever like me?

01:16:37.844 --> 01:16:39.679
She didn't hit you in the nuts, did she?

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:41.556
Yes, she did, Jax.

01:16:41.848 --> 01:16:43.683
Yes, she did.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.643
I have failed you.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.770
I could not defeat Goro.

01:16:48.313 --> 01:16:49.939
If it wasn't for Scorpion...

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:52.025
Failed? No.

01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:55.820
Your destiny was never
to defeat Goro, Liu Kang.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:59.282
It was to defeat Shao Kahn.

01:17:00.408 --> 01:17:03.244
You have failed me.

01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:05.246
I'm sorry, Master.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.749
It was that old fool, Raiden.

01:17:07.999 --> 01:17:09.334
- He--
- Silence!

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:11.919
Gather our forces.

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:15.590
It's time to end this game

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.092
once and for all.
