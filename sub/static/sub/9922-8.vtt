WEBVTT

01:57.155 --> 01:59.115
I cannot believe
this is happening.

01:59.741 --> 02:02.827
We agreed to raid with
the mighty Ragnar Lothbrok.

02:03.411 --> 02:04.912
Now we are running away.

02:04.996 --> 02:07.165
You saw what happened.
You were there.

02:07.665 --> 02:09.667
What would you
have done differently?

02:11.377 --> 02:13.254
I don't think you understand.

02:14.547 --> 02:16.299
This has nothing
to do with us.

02:17.133 --> 02:20.052
We bought into the magic
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

02:20.636 --> 02:23.139
We thought no one
could stand in his way.

02:23.222 --> 02:27.351
In our world,
we cannot accept compromise.

02:27.977 --> 02:29.854
We cannot accept failure.

02:30.021 --> 02:33.149
Someone is always
responsible for failure.

02:38.613 --> 02:40.114
If I were you,

02:41.073 --> 02:44.577
I wouldn't talk about
Ragnar Lothbrok like that
to my face.

03:02.261 --> 03:03.846
Have we been beaten?

03:06.516 --> 03:08.726
No, not us.

03:10.269 --> 03:11.854
Not the gods.

03:13.022 --> 03:14.315
Just Ragnar.

03:21.656 --> 03:23.407
You know
this weakens you.

03:25.201 --> 03:27.411
This weakens you
in every way.

03:50.184 --> 03:51.561
Count Odo,
I am forever
in your debt.

03:52.353 --> 03:54.772
Well, the tribute
should not all go
to me, Your Highness,

03:54.855 --> 03:56.524
but to your warriors
and soldiers

03:56.607 --> 03:58.150
who have surpassed
themselves in courage,

03:58.818 --> 04:01.988
and proved themselves
worthy successors to the
armies of Charlemagne.

04:03.197 --> 04:05.157
You are the
savior of Paris.

04:05.241 --> 04:08.035
Tell me, what can
I give you as a reward?

04:10.288 --> 04:12.206
It distresses me to
say so, Your Highness,

04:12.290 --> 04:14.458
but I fear the trust
you have placed

04:14.542 --> 04:18.129
in the Northman Rollo,
is misplaced.

04:20.255 --> 04:23.217
How so? Has he not
guided us well?

04:23.301 --> 04:26.554
Well, it's true he has
contributed to the
defeat of his brother.

04:26.637 --> 04:29.348
But that was not
for the sake of Paris.

04:30.349 --> 04:31.851
It was a quarrel
between them.

04:32.393 --> 04:33.853
And now Rollo
has the upper hand,

04:33.936 --> 04:37.857
I fear he may revert
to his instincts.

04:38.774 --> 04:41.652
Rollo's conversion to
Christianity is a joke.

04:43.112 --> 04:45.114
For there is nothing
else in the mind
of the pagan Rollo

04:45.197 --> 04:48.492
but the destruction
of Paris and its emperor.

04:52.288 --> 04:53.247
You may be right.

04:53.331 --> 04:54.749
I am right.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.543
And Roland can confirm it.

05:03.716 --> 05:06.427
I believe we can
no more trust him
than trust a wild boar.

05:07.511 --> 05:11.140
In any case, Your Highness,
he has now served his purpose.

05:13.351 --> 05:14.352
Then?

05:14.435 --> 05:17.104
Then you must use
your power, and
proceed quickly.

05:17.188 --> 05:20.900
Arrest Rollo before
he can savor and
celebrate his triumph.

05:20.983 --> 05:24.153
Or before he escapes
to raise an army
against us.

05:25.363 --> 05:26.656
But my daughter...

05:26.739 --> 05:27.990
Will get over it.

05:28.658 --> 05:32.078
She is young, and
can entertain the
prospect of a more...

05:33.537 --> 05:35.206
Civilized marriage.

05:46.050 --> 05:48.344
I am grateful
for your honesty,

05:48.969 --> 05:51.389
as well as your valor,
Count Odo.

05:52.473 --> 05:54.975
Let me reflect on
this for a while.

06:01.107 --> 06:02.650
Open the gates!

06:12.785 --> 06:14.495
God bless the King!

06:14.578 --> 06:18.624
God bless the King!
God bless the King!

06:18.708 --> 06:22.253
Thank you, Your Grace.
I feel blessed indeed.

06:22.336 --> 06:25.423
We have won a great
victory in Mercia!

06:25.881 --> 06:27.383
God be praised!

06:27.466 --> 06:29.135
God be praised!

06:29.218 --> 06:31.178
And there is no
more Ruling Council?

06:31.262 --> 06:33.889
Not when the councilors
all lie abed in the earth, no.

06:35.391 --> 06:36.392
And Wigstan?

06:36.475 --> 06:37.810
He has renounced
all this world

06:37.893 --> 06:40.312
and gone on a final
pilgrimage to Rome.

06:40.938 --> 06:43.315
I let him.
Then I am Queen again!

06:44.608 --> 06:48.237
Judith, have you
any news of your
husband or of Alfred?

06:48.404 --> 06:50.406
No, Sire.
There is no news.

06:50.489 --> 06:53.576
We must hold a special
mass to pray for them.

06:53.659 --> 06:55.077
But I know
the boy is safe.

06:55.578 --> 07:00.624
Athelstan walks beside him,
every step, every mile.

07:00.916 --> 07:02.585
Of that,
I am most certain.

07:06.130 --> 07:09.175
And now,
forgive me.

07:09.258 --> 07:11.302
I am weary,
and must rest.

08:14.824 --> 08:15.866
Bjorn!

08:17.910 --> 08:18.911
What?

08:24.208 --> 08:27.127
Tell everyone
we're going to
make camp here.

08:29.380 --> 08:30.422
Why would we
camp here?

08:31.215 --> 08:32.299
Just do it.

08:32.383 --> 08:33.424
I want to know why.

08:33.717 --> 08:35.385
You don't need
to know why.

08:39.765 --> 08:41.933
Sound the horns!
We camp here!

09:08.460 --> 09:09.461
Sigurd.

09:09.795 --> 09:10.796
What?

09:14.133 --> 09:15.134
Are you not hungry?

09:19.054 --> 09:20.306
What's wrong with you?

09:21.015 --> 09:23.601
Don't you like to listen
to Harbard's stories?

09:24.435 --> 09:27.605
Why don't you tell
me what's wrong? Hmm?

09:28.063 --> 09:29.732
Is it something
to do with me?

09:30.399 --> 09:32.151
I wish my father
was here.

09:33.068 --> 09:34.862
Everything is strange.

09:37.197 --> 09:39.533
Hey, boy. Sigurd!

09:40.492 --> 09:41.493
Let him go.

09:42.036 --> 09:43.704
You don't understand.

09:43.954 --> 09:45.789
I want to tell
him that I love him.

09:46.916 --> 09:48.459
He has
the wrong idea.

09:50.294 --> 09:52.463
I love all of you.

10:05.392 --> 10:06.894
What
are we doing here?

10:06.977 --> 10:09.897
Yes.
We also want to know.

10:10.648 --> 10:12.399
What is the point
of making camp here?

10:12.483 --> 10:14.693
When we ought to
be continuing downriver.

10:14.818 --> 10:17.279
When we came up,
we saw a few
sizeable settlements.

10:17.363 --> 10:18.822
They were ripe
for attacking.

10:18.906 --> 10:20.741
At least we wouldn't
go home empty-handed.

10:20.824 --> 10:21.951
But they
are not Paris.

10:22.117 --> 10:23.285
We left Paris behind.

10:23.661 --> 10:25.037
Maybe you have,
but I haven't.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.830
What do you mean?
What I say.

10:26.914 --> 10:29.249
Nobody here understands
what you're saying,
King Ragnar.

10:29.333 --> 10:33.796
Well, then maybe
they ought to listen,
instead of talking.

10:38.092 --> 10:41.345
We are going to lift
the boats up the cliff.

10:42.388 --> 10:46.934
Then, we are to carry them
across the mountains,

10:47.559 --> 10:49.144
past the forts,

10:49.228 --> 10:53.190
and then simply slide them
back into the river. Upstream.

10:57.695 --> 11:00.364
Carry them?
Up there?

11:01.657 --> 11:02.658
Yes.

11:03.701 --> 11:04.952
Up there.

11:05.953 --> 11:07.955
You can do that,
can't you, Floki?

11:12.626 --> 11:14.128
Or am I wrong?

11:16.171 --> 11:17.214
No.

11:18.382 --> 11:20.300
I can do it, Ragnar.

11:20.384 --> 11:21.927
I can do it for you.

11:26.265 --> 11:28.809
Everything I do,
Ragnar, is for you.

11:33.897 --> 11:35.065
Let's empty
the boats.

12:04.553 --> 12:05.679
My Lord,

12:06.847 --> 12:09.433
I trust you are
well rested after
such great exertions.

12:09.808 --> 12:12.227
Forgive me,
I had to come
and see you.

12:12.311 --> 12:15.022
We have important matters
to discuss between us.

12:15.731 --> 12:16.940
Indeed.

12:18.525 --> 12:20.944
You know, of course,
that I am with child.

12:22.112 --> 12:24.823
And who, pray,
is the father?

12:25.240 --> 12:27.117
Your son,
Aethelwulf.

12:29.119 --> 12:30.079
My son?

12:30.162 --> 12:31.205
Yes.

12:31.914 --> 12:34.541
After he rescued me,
we formed an attachment.

12:35.167 --> 12:36.960
A sincere attachment.

12:38.879 --> 12:41.173
How strange life is.

12:44.259 --> 12:45.469
Have you told Judith?

12:45.552 --> 12:46.970
I have told
no one but you.

12:48.388 --> 12:52.768
I also need to
return to Mercia,
as her true queen,

12:52.851 --> 12:54.478
by your good graces.

12:55.813 --> 12:58.816
You are no longer
Queen of Mercia.

13:04.071 --> 13:06.907
But if, if the council
are all dead, and
Wigstan is gone, then...

13:06.990 --> 13:08.700
You are no longer
the Queen,

13:09.493 --> 13:11.495
because I am the King.

13:14.498 --> 13:16.416
You are the King of Mercia?

13:16.500 --> 13:20.379
And of Wessex,
together. Yes.

13:21.839 --> 13:22.840
Waerferth.

13:28.512 --> 13:31.265
Before they were
unfortunately put to death,

13:31.348 --> 13:34.393
the members of
the Ruling Council,
along with your family,

13:34.518 --> 13:37.354
were obliged
to put their seals
to these documents,

13:37.646 --> 13:39.940
whereby Lord Wigstan,
in the presence of

13:40.023 --> 13:42.985
the laity and
the clergy of Mercia,

13:43.068 --> 13:46.530
accepted both
your abdication
from the throne

13:47.197 --> 13:49.158
and my assumption of it.

13:49.616 --> 13:50.701
What?

13:51.034 --> 13:55.914
As you see,
the devices are legal,
the documents, binding.

13:56.206 --> 13:59.418
Both in the eyes
of men and of God.

14:02.462 --> 14:04.756
No! You are a monster!

14:05.507 --> 14:07.217
I always knew.

14:07.301 --> 14:10.804
But, until this moment,
I never realized how
truly monstrous you are!

14:10.888 --> 14:12.764
My own sins seem
so trivial, so unimpressive!

14:16.560 --> 14:20.731
How do you sleep
at night, Lord Ecbert?
How do you sleep?

14:42.294 --> 14:46.548
Heave! Pull!

14:48.759 --> 14:50.093
Heave!

14:50.218 --> 14:51.595
Hand me
two of those.

14:54.514 --> 14:55.766
Keep them coming.

14:57.434 --> 14:58.602
Take hold of this.

15:02.022 --> 15:06.360
Pull! Pull! Pull!

15:07.611 --> 15:09.446
It's already
on the cliff.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.281
Pull!

15:19.331 --> 15:21.041
What do you
want me to do?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.794
Take the rope.
Tie it off.

15:30.133 --> 15:32.511
I have it.
You take that one.

15:34.596 --> 15:37.224
Ah, you had
better say that.

15:38.475 --> 15:40.268
Grab the other side.
Grab it!

15:40.352 --> 15:43.605
You're insane,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

15:43.981 --> 15:47.609
You're insane.
Because this
is beautiful.

15:48.318 --> 15:49.319
It's beautiful.

15:50.195 --> 15:52.990
After everything we
heard and thought,

15:54.241 --> 15:55.575
we still
underestimated you.

15:55.659 --> 15:58.996
We feel stupid.
I feel stupid
right enough.

15:59.663 --> 16:03.500
But we're honored
to be here with you
doing the impossible.

16:17.014 --> 16:18.348
Your Grace,

16:18.974 --> 16:22.728
I wish to commend you
for everything you've done
for me, and for Paris.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.604
And for me.

16:25.856 --> 16:28.442
I gave you my word.
And I kept it.

16:29.693 --> 16:33.363
Then I drink to you,
and salute you,
and thank God for you.

16:33.572 --> 16:34.698
Amen!

16:35.198 --> 16:38.493
The defeat of Ragnar Lothbrok
will resound down the ages.

16:38.577 --> 16:39.619
What defeat?

16:42.247 --> 16:44.958
As long as my brother
is still alive,
he is not defeated.

16:45.375 --> 16:46.710
He has retreated.

16:47.044 --> 16:49.713
His chance to attack
again has diminished.

16:50.672 --> 16:54.217
And in the meantime,
we can continue to build
our defenses against him.

16:54.301 --> 16:58.472
You talk as if you no longer
need me to protect you.

17:00.557 --> 17:03.226
I do not wish to give
you that impression.

17:06.188 --> 17:09.398
You should also know
that I am carrying
Rollo's child.

17:14.988 --> 17:17.406
How strange life is.

17:24.289 --> 17:26.791
So let me drink to
the first child...

17:28.585 --> 17:31.379
...of our
Frankish-Viking alliance.

17:32.172 --> 17:33.965
Long may it continue.

17:35.342 --> 17:36.384
<i>Salut.</i>

17:40.097 --> 17:41.389
Good afternoon.

18:09.292 --> 18:11.336
I have not
seen you for a long time.

18:12.754 --> 18:14.464
I suppose you
are bored with me.

18:16.883 --> 18:18.635
You are very
amusing, Therese,

18:19.594 --> 18:22.389
but I was busy
fighting the Northmen.
Did nobody tell you?

18:22.472 --> 18:23.807
Of course they told me.

18:25.058 --> 18:26.309
You are a great hero.

18:27.602 --> 18:29.437
But still, since you
returned to the city,

18:29.521 --> 18:31.314
you've made no
effort to see me.

18:32.774 --> 18:34.359
And, in the meantime,

18:34.484 --> 18:36.361
I have had
an interesting idea.

18:42.117 --> 18:43.326
What idea?

18:44.661 --> 18:46.163
I thought, for once,

18:47.330 --> 18:49.791
you might like me
to whip you.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.502
Of course, you can
choose the whip.

18:52.836 --> 18:55.005
And you will always
be able to tell me
when to stop.

18:56.548 --> 18:59.050
But I would prefer to
decide that for myself.

19:09.769 --> 19:10.854
You are right.

19:11.980 --> 19:13.148
The idea appeals.

19:20.697 --> 19:21.781
Sigurd, stop!

19:21.865 --> 19:23.074
Where are you
taking me?

19:23.158 --> 19:24.534
You have to come.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.090
Are you ready?

20:21.341 --> 20:22.425
Yes.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.346
Strike.

20:29.933 --> 20:31.101
Harder.

20:32.268 --> 20:33.853
Are you sure?
Yes, yes.

20:33.937 --> 20:35.855
Much harder!
I barely felt that.

20:40.276 --> 20:42.362
No, no, no. Harder!

20:43.196 --> 20:44.698
If you insist.

20:57.293 --> 20:59.629
- Roland?
- Poor Odo.

21:01.464 --> 21:03.800
Who would have thought?
How could you?

21:05.343 --> 21:07.345
You are like a son to me.

21:08.138 --> 21:09.931
Really?

21:21.192 --> 21:25.196
No, no, Roland.
No, I beg you. Please listen.

22:20.126 --> 22:21.336
Judith.

22:22.754 --> 22:24.380
No, do not smile.

22:25.048 --> 22:27.759
You'll not want to smile after
I've made my confession.

22:28.551 --> 22:30.428
What are you talking about?

22:31.679 --> 22:34.724
You know that the child
I carry is by your husband.

22:35.683 --> 22:39.729
Yes, I know
my husband lay with you.

22:40.730 --> 22:42.732
And I forgive you.

22:44.150 --> 22:49.030
Both he and you,
for Christian charity,
and for love.

22:51.157 --> 22:52.617
Sweet Judith.

22:54.577 --> 22:56.579
Judith, I need your help.

22:57.330 --> 22:58.581
I am betrayed.

22:58.665 --> 22:59.958
Betrayed?

23:00.708 --> 23:02.752
By whom?
By the King.

23:03.670 --> 23:06.965
He has made himself
King of Mercia,
at my expense.

23:07.048 --> 23:08.675
And now I am nothing.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.847
Ecbert did this
to you? Dear God.

23:15.515 --> 23:17.725
What will you do?
I cannot stay here.

23:17.809 --> 23:19.978
I will take Magnus
and I will go away.

23:20.061 --> 23:21.187
Where?
Somewhere.

23:21.271 --> 23:22.647
Anywhere that
Ecbert is not King.

23:22.730 --> 23:25.859
But, Judith,
I need your help
to escape.

23:29.779 --> 23:31.197
Will you help me?

23:35.785 --> 23:37.453
Thank you, my friend.

24:23.666 --> 24:25.585
No. No.

24:25.668 --> 24:27.420
No, no, no.

24:27.503 --> 24:30.089
Stop it. Stop.
Stop now.

24:30.173 --> 24:33.092
Stop, stop, stop.

24:34.969 --> 24:36.930
Why are you
so angry, little one?

24:37.013 --> 24:39.849
Huh! You don't know?
You don't know why?

24:41.017 --> 24:43.186
What have I done
to you? Hmm?

24:44.354 --> 24:46.105
I haven't done
anything to you.

24:46.898 --> 24:47.899
I love you.

24:48.316 --> 24:51.194
How can you love me
when you sleep with
every woman in Kattegat?

24:51.319 --> 24:54.239
Oh, I don't sleep
with every woman.

24:54.322 --> 24:56.032
Only those who need me.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.535
Enough now.

24:59.619 --> 25:01.996
Enough. Enough.

25:03.122 --> 25:07.210
I do not love
these other women
as I love you, hmm?

25:07.877 --> 25:11.798
I have sex with them
to free them of their
devils and their fears.

25:11.881 --> 25:14.175
I take their troubles
upon myself,

25:14.259 --> 25:16.928
as I took Ivar's
pains upon myself.

25:18.388 --> 25:21.224
Everything I do
is holy.

25:25.561 --> 25:27.397
That's why you
called me back.

25:28.356 --> 25:33.069
I heard you calling
to me across empty
oceans and vast deserts.

25:33.486 --> 25:35.321
That is why I returned.

25:40.994 --> 25:43.246
I try to live
like the gods.

25:44.539 --> 25:47.208
I reject everything
of this world...

25:48.584 --> 25:52.338
Honor and glory,
love of oneself,
even shame.

25:52.422 --> 25:55.300
I only care about
the will of the gods.

25:57.385 --> 25:59.762
Only then
can everything
worldly pass away,

26:00.388 --> 26:02.682
can the voices of
the gods be heard.

26:04.934 --> 26:08.313
And then their
spirit dwells in me,

26:08.396 --> 26:11.774
and I feel the ability
to heal and prophecy.

26:14.360 --> 26:17.280
And take on the sins
of the world...

26:20.700 --> 26:21.909
Upon myself.

26:36.466 --> 26:39.385
I have broken my life
for your sake!

26:41.137 --> 26:43.389
I do not know
if you are a god,

26:45.350 --> 26:50.813
but all I longed
for was your presence
and your caresses.

26:52.315 --> 26:56.903
I will always be with you,
little one. Always.

26:59.155 --> 27:01.908
But do not try to
possess me, hmm?

27:04.660 --> 27:07.163
Because possession is
the opposite of love.

27:18.508 --> 27:20.843
Give this to Ivar. Hmm?

27:25.306 --> 27:26.391
Where are you going?

27:56.504 --> 27:58.965
Do you still think
the moon is a god?

28:00.508 --> 28:04.178
You know, of course,
about Kwenthrith
and my son?

28:04.679 --> 28:10.226
I also know that you
have taken the crown
of Mercia from her head.

28:10.852 --> 28:14.105
I had no choice. None.

28:15.064 --> 28:18.317
No one in Mercia was
ever going to accept
her as Queen again.

28:18.401 --> 28:19.694
Even had I wanted
to reinstate...

28:19.777 --> 28:22.738
But you didn't
want to, did you?

28:23.865 --> 28:26.701
You'd worked it out
before with Waerferth.

28:27.952 --> 28:30.496
Everything had
been arranged.

28:32.790 --> 28:34.917
Isn't that true?
It's true.

28:41.883 --> 28:43.968
And I ask
your forgiveness.

28:46.929 --> 28:48.556
My forgiveness?
Yes.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.558
Because I cannot
ask for God's.

28:50.641 --> 28:52.935
I know I'm already
beyond that.

28:55.688 --> 28:59.525
But if only you
will understand.

29:02.528 --> 29:04.405
Why me?

29:16.042 --> 29:17.418
I love you.

29:20.713 --> 29:25.468
I know you may
treat this statement
as compromised...

29:26.594 --> 29:30.765
Disingenuous,
perhaps even as a lie.
And why shouldn't you?

29:33.851 --> 29:35.311
But the funny thing is...

29:37.355 --> 29:38.814
It's true.

29:41.150 --> 29:44.320
I have lied about
many, many things,

29:44.403 --> 29:46.280
both to others
and to myself.

29:46.364 --> 29:48.866
But I find
to my surprise

29:50.493 --> 29:52.495
that I cannot
lie to you,

29:53.913 --> 29:55.915
nor escape
your judgment.

29:59.252 --> 30:01.879
Please, Judith...

30:04.840 --> 30:06.467
Don't forsake me.

30:12.974 --> 30:16.310
Pull! Up!

30:19.730 --> 30:20.731
Slow!

30:21.315 --> 30:22.108
Ah! Help me!

30:26.153 --> 30:27.488
That's it!

30:30.908 --> 30:32.118
Here!

30:39.917 --> 30:41.335
That's good!

30:50.553 --> 30:51.637
Erlendur! No!

31:11.407 --> 31:12.742
Pull!

31:13.034 --> 31:14.368
Pull!

31:16.412 --> 31:17.705
Pull!

31:25.755 --> 31:28.716
Count Odo has been
executed, by my order,

31:28.799 --> 31:31.635
for disloyalty
and high treason.

31:33.137 --> 31:37.308
He deceived me, even though
I trusted and rewarded him.

31:40.311 --> 31:43.731
And for such deception
and treachery,

31:44.106 --> 31:46.776
there can only ever
be one punishment.

31:52.782 --> 31:56.786
Your Grace will now be
entrusted completely with
the defense of our realm.

31:59.705 --> 32:02.124
This is the Iron
Hand of Frankia.

32:03.793 --> 32:05.127
I give it to Your Grace

32:06.295 --> 32:08.297
as a symbol of my favor.

32:13.219 --> 32:14.887
Thank you, Father.

32:15.638 --> 32:17.348
You have made
the right choice.

32:41.372 --> 32:42.373
Wait.

32:45.668 --> 32:47.002
Come here.

32:59.682 --> 33:02.017
Why did you look
at me that way?

33:03.644 --> 33:05.229
In that fashion?

33:06.564 --> 33:08.482
Why should
you pity me?

33:10.025 --> 33:12.653
I think you carry
a terrible burden.

33:15.030 --> 33:16.782
And you carry it alone.

33:21.871 --> 33:23.330
Are you ready?

33:23.956 --> 33:25.374
Do you believe?

33:27.543 --> 33:32.798
Why does the most famous
shield maiden in the world
ask us if we believe?

33:32.882 --> 33:36.677
Of course we believe.
I never had any doubts. Never.

33:37.178 --> 33:40.055
We will travel to Hel
and back with you and Ragnar.

34:02.912 --> 34:03.996
I have to go.

34:04.079 --> 34:06.624
I know. I'm going
to come with you.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.333
Ah, no, you are not.

34:08.417 --> 34:10.668
I am coming.
Don't deny me.

34:11.754 --> 34:13.589
I've made that mistake before.

34:14.172 --> 34:17.635
I'm not her. And I'm going
to save your life.

34:28.270 --> 34:29.103
Helga.

34:32.775 --> 34:33.775
Helga.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.282
I have to leave.

34:41.199 --> 34:42.201
Leave?

34:42.284 --> 34:44.078
We must cross
the mountains.

34:44.161 --> 34:46.080
But you will be
safe here.

34:46.163 --> 34:48.958
You stay here. Get well.

34:51.085 --> 34:52.085
I don't mind.

34:54.045 --> 34:55.464
But don't die, Floki.

35:30.958 --> 35:31.959
Ah.

35:34.795 --> 35:36.171
I'm leaving.

35:36.547 --> 35:39.133
I need you to
give me what
you have left.

35:40.217 --> 35:41.760
There is nothing left.

35:43.887 --> 35:45.180
You're lying again.

35:48.517 --> 35:49.852
Let me tell you...

35:50.185 --> 35:54.732
The only reason that
I wanted you to come
was because of the medicine.

35:57.026 --> 35:59.862
I am here
because you said
I was a free woman.

35:59.945 --> 36:02.114
I never said that
you were free.

36:03.032 --> 36:05.117
I said that you could come

36:05.909 --> 36:09.121
and go as you please.

36:12.499 --> 36:13.709
You're a liar.

36:14.335 --> 36:17.588
You've lied to me
and you've lied
to your people.

36:18.672 --> 36:20.507
But you made the mistake
of telling me your secret

36:20.591 --> 36:23.677
about the slaughter
of the families
in Wessex.

37:19.858 --> 37:20.859
It's here.

37:46.969 --> 37:49.930
It's all right.
It's all right.

37:51.265 --> 37:53.767
Now, make sure that
you disguise the boats
from the Franks.

37:57.646 --> 38:00.023
And take care
of Helga. Huh.

38:03.152 --> 38:04.945
Hide
yourselves well.

38:07.698 --> 38:08.699
Go on.

38:09.992 --> 38:10.993
Go on.

39:20.812 --> 39:23.232
Halt, My Lady! Come with us!
No! Let go!

39:23.524 --> 39:24.525
Magnus!
Clear a path!

39:24.608 --> 39:25.567
Magnus! Wait!

39:26.485 --> 39:28.403
Let go of me!
Make way! Make way!

39:28.529 --> 39:29.821
Magnus! Let go of me!

39:30.572 --> 39:31.698
Magnus!

39:32.866 --> 39:35.827
You must understand
that I cannot
allow you to leave.

39:36.078 --> 39:37.913
Especially,
not with Magnus.

39:38.664 --> 39:40.290
What difference
does it make to you?

39:40.874 --> 39:42.751
It makes
every difference.

39:43.377 --> 39:45.879
Magnus is the son
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

39:45.963 --> 39:49.675
When Ragnar Lothbrok
returns to this island,
as well he might,

39:49.758 --> 39:54.263
I want to show him
the son that I have
cared for and protected.

39:54.596 --> 39:58.767
You also carry
my son's child.

39:58.934 --> 40:02.229
Am I not entitled
to show an interest
in his future?

40:03.480 --> 40:05.274
And besides,

40:05.440 --> 40:07.985
where on earth
did you intend to go?

40:08.151 --> 40:12.155
I intended to go
as far away from
you as possible.

40:13.198 --> 40:17.452
That is not acceptable.
You will stay here
and be confined.

40:17.578 --> 40:21.164
I will place guards
around the villa.
Do not expect to escape.

40:26.962 --> 40:28.630
- Heave!
- Heave!

40:28.714 --> 40:29.840
Heave!

40:30.173 --> 40:31.425
Heave!

40:31.508 --> 40:32.509
Pull!

40:32.593 --> 40:36.179
Heave! Heave!

40:37.264 --> 40:38.807
- Heave!
- Pull!

40:39.308 --> 40:40.934
- Pull there!
- Heave!

40:41.018 --> 40:42.394
- Pull there!
- Pull!

40:52.487 --> 40:53.655
- Pull!
- Pull!

41:03.332 --> 41:06.752
Heave! Heave!

41:06.835 --> 41:08.170
Heave!

41:09.087 --> 41:10.255
Slow!

41:10.714 --> 41:11.798
Release!

41:12.507 --> 41:14.176
- Heave!
- Heave!

41:19.640 --> 41:20.641
Pull!

41:24.102 --> 41:25.103
More rope!

41:26.188 --> 41:27.189
Pull!

41:41.161 --> 41:43.163
Good night,
sweet Magnus.

41:47.959 --> 41:49.586
My sweet child.

42:18.573 --> 42:19.908
Wait.

42:23.036 --> 42:25.580
You have
been forbidden
from entering.

42:26.873 --> 42:28.208
I must see the King.

42:28.291 --> 42:29.334
It is impossible.

42:30.711 --> 42:32.713
Hyah!

43:07.330 --> 43:09.916
Things could have
been so much better.

43:10.959 --> 43:13.754
Things could
always be better.

43:18.425 --> 43:23.805
How does it feel to
be so close to death,
Mighty King Ecbert?

43:25.348 --> 43:27.601
You know that
I will kill you.

43:28.393 --> 43:33.148
One stab, and my
unborn child is the
future ruler of Wessex.

43:33.231 --> 43:35.358
Of course
you could kill me.

43:35.984 --> 43:40.238
But if you kill me,
my guards will kill you,

43:40.322 --> 43:42.282
with no questions asked.

43:55.295 --> 43:58.340
Do you know what
would have been
better for me?

43:58.507 --> 44:00.217
Can you even imagine?

44:06.056 --> 44:08.350
To have been
born a man.

44:36.711 --> 44:39.172
Poor Judith.

44:39.256 --> 44:41.383
You have killed twice over.

44:57.315 --> 44:58.984
Look what you have
made me become.
