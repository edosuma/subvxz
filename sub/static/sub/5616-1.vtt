03:25.280 --> 03:27.362
MAN: They had a perfect moment in time.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.767
That's as much as that cliff
was going to give them.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.763
I'm glad that she got in her car
and drove off.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.770
Because if she would have hung out
any longer,

03:41.880 --> 03:44.451
it was like the entire mountain
was going to fall on top of her.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.961
That cliff had it out for them
or something.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.806
I don't know what it was but it just
didn't end well for the Boenishes.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.571
Nothing happens by chance.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.763
Every single thing that ever happens,
happens for a reason.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.685
Happens due to the law of the universe.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.729
And it's just incumbent upon me

04:02.840 --> 04:06.811
to figure out enough
what those laws are and obey those laws.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.888
I feel that when I jump off a cliff,

04:09.000 --> 04:13.164
I'm obeying those laws of the universe,
including gravity.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.881
- Ready?
- WOMAN: I'm ready.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.889
OK. Four, three, two, one, go.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.651
We've moved over to the mid-point
of our newsroom

04:27.760 --> 04:29.888
to get away from
the mainstream news of the day

04:30.000 --> 04:32.401
and look at some more unusual things
going on.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.965
Of course, I have been the one

04:34.080 --> 04:36.401
with the more unusual things going on
for most of the day.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.330
One of them is the growing fad
of parachuting from skyscrapers.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.922
Especially here in Los Angeles. And you
pursued that yesterday afternoon.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.691
MAN: Downtown Los Angeles is a natural
for this sort of thing.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.690
In particular, the high-rise
construction boom is a big attraction.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.724
Because the unfinished buildings
usually have little security,

04:51.840 --> 04:54.491
jumpers can make it secretly
to the top and make theirjumps.

04:54.640 --> 04:58.042
Not too many years ago, this sport
wouldn't have worked in Los Angeles

04:58.160 --> 05:00.401
because there were no true
high-rise buildings.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.683
But now several buildings
are above 50 stories tall

05:03.800 --> 05:08.488
and skyscraper skydiving is a big sport.
It is also illegal.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.485
MAN: We almost feel like we're
astronauts walking on the moon.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.491
It just gives us a feeling of power
and of joy.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.649
We want to share it with the world
but every time we try to,

05:29.760 --> 05:33.242
people can't relate because,
in a sense, it's out of their realm.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.483
When I first started this story,
I thought that's a crazy thing.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.840
Why would anyone want to do that?

05:37.960 --> 05:39.883
But after talking for a while
with those people

05:40.000 --> 05:41.729
and hearing the thrill they get from it,

05:41.840 --> 05:44.366
I have to admit it's a little tempting.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.131
- No!
- Only a little, but it is.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.805
- Doofus!
- (LAUGHS)

05:48.920 --> 05:52.129
My guest's name rhymes with Danish.
His name is Carl Boenish.

05:52.240 --> 05:56.290
You are a cinematographer, A,
but you are, B, a cliff jumper.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.727
I want to say that again
so people know I meant to say it.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.241
Cliff jumper. You jump off cliffs, Carl.
You do do that?

06:01.440 --> 06:02.680
Yes, I do, Pat.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.444
CARL: One of my mottos is
there's no future in growing up.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.608
I just never want to grow up.

07:12.720 --> 07:16.167
Most people, I guess they grow old.
I don't want to grow old or grow up.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.361
(WOMAN LAUGHS)

07:17.560 --> 07:19.483
I don't want to be childish.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.008
But I think there are a lot of virtues
in being childlike.

07:23.120 --> 07:27.284
Because if you study a child, he hasn't
been taught what he can't do.

07:30.640 --> 07:34.725
- WOMAN: We all do a lot of praying.
- MAN: You do pray?

07:34.840 --> 07:38.003
CARL: I think a lot of this comes
from a metaphysical basis, even.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.565
A spiritual basis.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.844
I think that the biggest aspect to why
I do this is for rejuvenation.

07:43.960 --> 07:48.682
Because if I can master these goals, it
improves every other department in life.

07:48.840 --> 07:52.640
I think that if a group of people
can watch me jump off a building

07:52.760 --> 07:55.843
and be successful, they can say,
"Well, I probably don't want to do that

07:55.960 --> 07:59.089
but maybe I could bowl
that perfect 300 game."

07:59.240 --> 08:03.040
LONG: He was a guy that was everything
and everywhere all at once.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.801
And he had this crazy infectious
enthusiasm. And he would laugh.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.691
And he would fly over to the piano
and play some classical riffs

08:09.840 --> 08:12.161
and then he would talk about
quantum mechanics.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.408
And then he would get a little weepy

08:14.560 --> 08:18.929
and then he'd wax nostalgic
about some job that he had.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.771
Then we'd go out
and jump on the trampoline.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.446
It was like a stream of consciousness.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.650
Half from hell and half from, you know,
some better world somewhere.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.924
I mean, it was really an interesting
kind of thing being around this guy.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.168
WOMAN: Our father's name was Carl.

08:37.280 --> 08:41.171
And Ronnie was Carl,
so at home, we always called him Ronnie.

08:42.600 --> 08:46.400
My brother got polio
from a polio vaccine.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.801
They weren't sure he was going to live.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.889
MAN: But he survived it.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.163
And for his recovery he was in
a wheelchair and couldn't walk.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.884
His legs were really weak.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.083
So he spent his time
playing the piano.

09:04.360 --> 09:08.684
PRICE: When he had polio, he missed
a whole year of elementary school.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.725
But once he finally got cleared
and could go back to school,

09:12.840 --> 09:16.003
he challenged every boy in his class
one at a time

09:16.120 --> 09:17.849
until he could beat them
in a foot race.

09:17.960 --> 09:21.726
And he beat every one of them.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.402
He talked to me a lot about
his birth mother leaving.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.086
And I think that touched him deeply.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.844
Then he was in high school
and he was, you know,

09:34.960 --> 09:38.362
very intellectual
and always doing his calculus.

09:38.480 --> 09:42.280
BOB: So he had just finished college
when I was born

09:42.440 --> 09:46.126
and started working for Hughes Aircraft
as an electrical engineer.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.647
WENTZEL: Once he got into skydiving
he just changed.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.326
They're always pulling you in.
You're part of a group.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.046
You have to fly together.
So he changed completely.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.683
WOMAN: You used to be an engineer.
Pretty safe, secure type job.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.371
When and how did you make
the decision to give that all up

10:32.520 --> 10:35.683
and go into doing this,
what you like to do, full time?

10:35.800 --> 10:39.247
It's funny.
My boss at Hughes Aircraft told me,

10:39.360 --> 10:42.364
"Carl, the man who knows how
will always have a job."

10:42.480 --> 10:45.290
"The man who knows why
will be his boss."

10:45.400 --> 10:48.847
And at that time I knew how to design
electrical circuits.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.126
I knew how to skydive.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.210
But I knew why to skydive

10:53.360 --> 10:56.045
much better than I knew
why the electronic circuits worked.

10:59.880 --> 11:05.284
OK, new sheet of paper.
New heading entitled The <i>Gypsy</i> Moths.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.210
PRICE:
He was working at Hughes Aircraft.

11:08.320 --> 11:12.211
And he got the opportunity
to do <i>Gypsy</i> Moths.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.721
And that was a big MGM production.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.888
CARL: I was asked by MGM

11:17.000 --> 11:21.608
to be in charge of the aerial free-fall
filming sequences.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.846
MAN: John Frankenheimer,

11:23.960 --> 11:27.601
the director who created
the excitement of <i>Grand Prix,</i>

11:27.800 --> 11:30.007
now captures the drama and spectacle

11:30.120 --> 11:36.844
of the death-defying game called
skydiving in The <i>Gypsy</i> Moths.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.770
So he went and took the <i>Gypsy</i> Moths job

11:39.880 --> 11:42.690
and that was the end
of his electrical engineering career.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.451
CARL: I didn't know how I wanted
to film the aerial sequences.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.404
I had to experiment
and try all kinds of things.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.331
And I had to find really young guys
who were willing to do that.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.010
Pull it! Pull it!

12:01.920 --> 12:05.288
Carl was an innovator. He was
probably the only one in Hollywood,

12:05.400 --> 12:08.643
or the area, that was known
for free-fall photography.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.247
MAN: Background of Carl Boenish
and his films.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.364
Carl Boenish's early start.

12:15.480 --> 12:20.850
He has been able to put off going back
to work two months at a time

12:21.000 --> 12:26.245
such that for over the last ten years,
he's never had to go back to work,

12:26.360 --> 12:29.569
and is accustomed to making film
payments instead of car payments.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.682
As it's worked out in the past,

12:31.800 --> 12:35.850
Carl Boenish usually spends
about two years

12:35.960 --> 12:38.930
to make one 15-minute film.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.645
If you were jumping with Boenish,
it was expected

12:42.840 --> 12:45.764
that you'd wear a helmet-mounted camera
or possibly two.

12:45.920 --> 12:49.561
Carl's main focus was to share
the wealth. Share that feeling.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.445
To share the feeling with people
that didn't understand it,

12:52.560 --> 12:55.450
that thought we were absolutely crazy
to do something like this.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.325
But once you see it
and see the beauty of it,

12:58.480 --> 13:01.006
I think people tend to understand
the motive.

13:25.160 --> 13:28.369
CARL:
I've been skydiving for 18 years now

13:28.480 --> 13:31.131
and I've been filmmaking
forjust as long.

13:31.240 --> 13:36.167
Primarily, I consider myself a filmmaker
first and a skydiver second.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.363
So whatever he did, he wanted to capture
on film the best way he could.

13:59.720 --> 14:06.968
I think he wanted to show the humanity,
the freedom, that is felt

14:07.080 --> 14:13.645
when you are pushing the envelope of
what the human spirit can accomplish.

14:30.600 --> 14:34.286
MAN: Yosemite is beautiful.
It's breathtaking.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.563
Many people cry when they first see it.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.808
It's beyond their expectation,
beyond their experience.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.051
I was the chief ranger in
Yosemite National Park.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.243
And my job was protection.

14:51.360 --> 14:56.400
So protecting the park from the people
and the people from the park

14:56.520 --> 14:59.000
and the people from the people.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.282
Where did you get the inclination
to jump off a cliff?

15:01.400 --> 15:06.008
Well, this comes from making
1500 parachute jumps over 15 years

15:06.120 --> 15:09.283
and becoming so proficient at it
that you wonder,

15:09.400 --> 15:11.050
well, what else is out there?

15:14.400 --> 15:18.689
MAN: El Capitan.
3,600 feet of polished granite

15:18.800 --> 15:21.201
rising from California's
Yosemite Valley.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.442
For climbers, its vertical ascent

15:23.560 --> 15:26.643
is one of the great challenges
of North America.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.842
A group of professional parachuters

15:29.000 --> 15:32.402
traveled to this unique spot
to experience flight.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.443
When I organized the first load
to go to El Capitan,

15:37.560 --> 15:40.689
we spent nearly all summer there,
four or five trips,

15:40.800 --> 15:46.045
scouting of the geography, finding,
hopefully, places suitable to jump.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.243
Then we stumbled upon
this really idyllic place

15:49.360 --> 15:53.729
that's about 3,000 feet tall

15:53.840 --> 15:57.083
with an overhang
of a couple hundred feet.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.680
And as soon as I saw it I yelled,
"Eureka!"

16:00.720 --> 16:02.768
MAN: The pioneers of this remarkable
attempt

16:02.880 --> 16:06.123
are skydivers Kent Lane and Tom Stark.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.244
Along with Kenny Gosselin, Mike Sherrin
and helper Sally Wenlzel.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.642
Expedition leader Carl Boenish
with Dave Blattell.

16:15.760 --> 16:20.402
Carl, on his own, was doing
a lot of research on El Cap.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.091
He then asked me
to help him with the filming of it.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.886
I wanted to figure out a way,
if possible,

16:28.080 --> 16:30.845
to film a person running off a cliff.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.244
But from a vantage point
looking back toward the cliff.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.370
The first jumps were going to be made
off El Cap

16:38.480 --> 16:42.201
and Carl wanted to get
motion-picture footage

16:42.320 --> 16:48.168
of the first jumpers running towards him
jumping off the cliff

16:48.280 --> 16:52.888
and then that way he could then follow
them down as they were in free fall.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.568
CARL: Actually, I made a homemade ladder

17:02.680 --> 17:04.808
that's about 20 feet long
out of aluminum.

17:04.960 --> 17:09.045
I perched on the end of this ladder
so I could film toward the cliff.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.970
BLATELL: It was a long pole.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.248
And it had some crosspieces on it

17:14.359 --> 17:16.839
to kind of make it like
a little bit of a ladder.

17:22.560 --> 17:28.203
When it was set up
by the rock climbers on El Cap,

17:28.319 --> 17:31.369
it was just this rod sticking out
from the mountain

17:31.480 --> 17:33.562
with a little bicycle seat.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.051
And if you were going to sit on
that bicycle seat,

17:38.200 --> 17:41.807
there's nothing between you
and 3,000 feet below you.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.082
I mean, it was just nothing.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.764
He would go out there...

17:57.880 --> 18:00.963
and then he'd have to get up the nerve

18:01.120 --> 18:05.284
and swing 180
so that he could sit on that seat.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.002
He was nuts.

18:14.640 --> 18:18.008
He was absolutely nuts.
Then you would hear his laugh

18:18.200 --> 18:19.884
and you were guaranteed
that he was nuts.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.480
And he talked us into jumping off
this thing.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.170
So we're all nuts.

18:26.920 --> 18:31.687
We were all young and not knowing
any better. We're ready to go.

18:32.920 --> 18:36.561
BLATELL: Kent Lane,
first jumper off of the first trip.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.490
Two and a half years' jumping,
600 jumps.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.327
My name is Kent Lane.
The first time I heard about it,

18:44.440 --> 18:47.444
it sounded like really a neat thing
to do.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.648
I was scared to death.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.330
When I was out on this ladder,
I'd make sure everyone was ready.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.124
And I would start the countdown.

18:59.320 --> 19:04.008
Five, four, three, two, one, go!

19:31.360 --> 19:38.130
I saw a wall, a huge granite wall,
accelerating right next to me.

19:38.280 --> 19:43.207
When you exit off of a cliff,
there's no wind to work with.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.765
And so how you go off

19:44.880 --> 19:48.851
is how you're going to stay
for the next four or five seconds.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.008
Can't wait to do it again.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.402
And so once we got down
on the ground

19:59.520 --> 20:01.727
we had ground crew
that took our gear

20:01.840 --> 20:06.289
and they placed them under rocks
or under logs. It is all mapped out.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.291
We were all dressed up as hikers.
All we did was we'd land and stood

20:10.400 --> 20:13.609
and ground crew changed us
from skydiver to hiker.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.768
And then we just, you know, dispersed.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.609
We were entirely successful
in all our cliff jumps

20:23.720 --> 20:28.601
because I feel that we were
constantly led by the idea

20:28.720 --> 20:35.330
that we were glorifying mankind's
beautiful spirit of seeking adventure

20:35.440 --> 20:39.729
and that we were within our rights of
freedom and dominium over all the Earth.

20:43.080 --> 20:47.130
There are many man-made laws that aren't
laws at all that need to be broken.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.648
One is a belief that it's impossible
to jump off a cliff.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.886
I felt the activity
I thought was exciting.

20:57.040 --> 21:01.887
And to do it off of El Cap
just trigged my imagination.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.809
I thought that was wonderful.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.446
I didn't feel adversarial,

21:06.560 --> 21:09.848
but it didn't keep me
from doing my job at times.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.804
It didn't seem
like it was going to stop.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.207
How do you herd a bunch of cats?

21:18.800 --> 21:21.883
We had word that there were
going to be cliff jumpers

21:22.040 --> 21:24.327
coming into the top of El Cap.

21:24.440 --> 21:27.444
And it was against the law.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.325
This is a cat-and-mouse part of it.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.848
LANE: A couple weeks later
when Carl and I went back

21:34.960 --> 21:37.088
and we jumped off,
I got caught by the ranger.

21:37.200 --> 21:42.366
I was the first person ever caught
for BASE jumping in Yosemite.

21:43.400 --> 21:47.962
MAN: Tom Stark, Dave Blattell
and Jill Morgan got citations.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.969
I was an attorney for
the Federal Government.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.485
So I couldn't represent them.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.921
But I did a lot of pro bono work
for them

21:54.080 --> 21:57.368
and we were trying to challenge
their park's regulation.

22:00.040 --> 22:03.249
Speaking of El Capitan, there have been
some controversies around that.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.882
Apparently the park did not want people
jumping off their cliffs.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.766
Yeah. That's true. And we can
certainly see their point of view.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.803
But they just didn't understand.

22:12.920 --> 22:16.322
In fact, they couldn't even believe
that we just jumped off.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.723
Basically, <i>we</i> will just jump off
and fall for ten seconds

22:19.840 --> 22:21.251
and fall over a thousand feet.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.882
I found most of the jumpers
very agreeable.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.530
Carl was special. You kind of have
an instinct about the ringleaders.

22:33.640 --> 22:38.362
He was easy to remember.
He had this aura of life.

22:38.480 --> 22:43.008
You don't have to dislike someone
to take away their freedom.

22:44.120 --> 22:47.841
My name is Carl Boenish.
I'm expedition of this leader.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.930
(LAUGHTER)

22:51.040 --> 22:52.041
Cut.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.164
MAN: The park ranger at the time
that issued these citations

22:55.280 --> 22:57.851
was aware that Carl was involved in it.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.844
MAN: <i>What did you say
with respect to the filming?</i>

23:01.960 --> 23:05.681
<i>CARL: OK, they asked me, you know,
whose equipment it was</i>

23:05.800 --> 23:08.087
<i>and first of all they said,
"Where is Carl?"</i>

23:08.240 --> 23:10.447
<i>You know, I mean,
where is Carl Boenish?</i>

23:10.600 --> 23:13.888
<i>- Really?
- Yeah. They're out for blood.</i>

23:16.880 --> 23:20.851
WENTZEL:
Somehow we got involved with rangers.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.367
The film was confiscated.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.609
Carl was very concerned about his film.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.442
MAN: One of those what was there
was the park ranger

23:29.560 --> 23:31.881
that sort of had this vendetta
against Carl

23:32.000 --> 23:36.244
and they continued to press
the litigation aspect.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.165
We don't want to be limited
by anything except nature.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.090
We always have to listen
to nature's laws.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.726
But not necessarily man's laws.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.450
The US Magistrate, Don Pitts,

23:49.560 --> 23:54.771
he was kind of tired of seeing
this parade of cliff jumpers coming in.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.531
So he was throwing the book at him.

24:00.640 --> 24:06.044
MAN: I know that the park ranger
was really trying to focus on Carl.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.567
CARL:
I don't mind being called paranoid,

24:10.680 --> 24:13.843
if that's what you want
to call it or me.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.965
I do admit to being extreme and radical.

24:18.080 --> 24:23.371
And I feel that I'm justified
in being extremely radical

24:23.600 --> 24:25.887
if it's based on truth and principle.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.321
I believe that truth is radical.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.688
WENTZEL: My time with Carl ended
at the beginning of '79.

24:34.800 --> 24:40.250
You were either all in or,
you know, there were challenges.

24:43.200 --> 24:48.286
At some level he was really trying
to kind of close that gap

24:48.400 --> 24:54.282
of getting that unconditional,
forever love by his side.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.802
The fact that Carl was around
40 years old and not married

24:59.920 --> 25:02.605
told me that he either wasn't
interested in women

25:02.720 --> 25:04.006
or not interested in marriage.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.329
He was a geek, a nerd, everything
you can imagine in that scope.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.524
I wouldn't say he was popular
with the ladies.

25:13.360 --> 25:20.005
I know that when it came to Jeanie,
something really captured him about her.

25:21.800 --> 25:27.569
His whole life just changed
and the focus of his life was Jeanie.

25:29.880 --> 25:34.807
Those of us who met Carl,
anybody, would go away

25:34.920 --> 25:37.924
with part of his goodness,
it becomes a part of you.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.327
And whenever
anybody expresses goodness,

25:40.440 --> 25:43.046
it travels away with that person.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.928
Carl and I first met in April of 1979.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.850
I was a sophomore at Pomona College.

25:53.720 --> 25:58.851
Carl was showing his most recent film,
which was Skydive.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.162
(APPLAUSE)

26:13.720 --> 26:16.451
Afterwards, he had us get in a circle.

26:16.560 --> 26:20.645
He said, "Everybody stand up.
Get in a circle and hold hands."

26:20.760 --> 26:24.651
So the group of us stood up and
held hands the way he had requested.

26:24.760 --> 26:28.287
We're thinking, "This is a bit odd.
Where is he going with this?"

26:28.440 --> 26:32.968
And, of course, he just wanted us
to experience the position

26:33.080 --> 26:37.404
that skydivers would be in
when they came into a star formation.

26:45.080 --> 26:49.449
His purity
was a very attractive quality.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.046
And everybody recognized that.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.206
When we were all departing,

26:54.320 --> 26:58.450
I saw another girl was talking to him
and giving him her phone number.

26:58.600 --> 27:04.323
And I thought, well, she's very
interested. So I just let it be.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.124
It had been fun to see Carl's movie.

27:08.280 --> 27:12.569
It was nice to meet
and talk with a parachutist.

27:12.720 --> 27:17.965
I wanted to pursue this somehow.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.289
And I thought to myself, "I know Carl."

27:21.400 --> 27:25.200
I believe that I wrote him a letter,
actually.

27:27.440 --> 27:31.365
He ended up calling me
and telling me,

27:31.480 --> 27:35.690
"I'll come out and get you.
It's right on the way to drop zone."

27:35.840 --> 27:39.208
And this ended up being our first date.

27:39.320 --> 27:43.370
Carl and I talked a lot
going out to the drop zone.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.086
It was a long drive.

27:46.200 --> 27:50.091
We talked about things
that we believed in.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.726
Principles that we held to.

28:02.120 --> 28:05.886
While we were at the drop zone
Carl said, "Let's have a foot race."

28:06.000 --> 28:08.526
And I thought, "OK."

28:16.320 --> 28:19.688
I think we were running
next to the airplane

28:19.840 --> 28:22.320
as the airplane
was starting to take off.

28:33.520 --> 28:37.411
It was just something
that came to him to do.

28:37.520 --> 28:41.161
I guess maybe in a sense,
it was just a gauge.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.005
A gauge of possibilities.

28:50.240 --> 28:53.722
It had gotten late in the day
after our day at the drop zone

28:53.840 --> 28:55.968
and it was a long drive back.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.401
Carl had told me that
his sister had her house

28:58.520 --> 29:03.560
right there at Lake Elsinore
and that she wasn't home.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.525
He said it will be fine
if we just spent the night there.

29:06.680 --> 29:10.366
So he said,
"Well, you can sleep here on the couch

29:10.480 --> 29:13.927
and I'll go sleep in the bedroom
where I usually do."

29:14.040 --> 29:18.762
After a couple of hours
he came in and said,

29:18.880 --> 29:22.202
"Can I lie down here
beside you on the floor?"

29:22.360 --> 29:27.082
Then I said, "Well, that's OK."

29:27.240 --> 29:28.480
"That's OK."

29:28.600 --> 29:31.410
Then he said, "Can I hold your hand?"

29:31.520 --> 29:34.888
And so I said, "Yeah."

29:48.400 --> 29:50.846
And so he was lying there
parallel to me

29:51.000 --> 29:55.210
and we're holding hands
and that's the way we spent the night.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.804
In a matter of just a few weeks,

30:08.920 --> 30:14.802
we covered all the ground
that each of us felt was necessary

30:14.960 --> 30:20.046
to figure out if we were sufficiently
compatible to start a life together.

30:20.200 --> 30:24.205
It wasn't start a relationship,
live together, any of that.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.051
It was start a life together,
get married.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.162
You're about to get married in a week.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.169
Yes. I'm very excited about that.

30:31.280 --> 30:34.170
Does your fiancée jump off cliffs?

30:34.280 --> 30:39.605
Well, not yet. She would like to.
Since we met, she's made eight skydives

30:39.720 --> 30:42.530
and she has a natural affinity
for the air.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.927
I think she's going to be
a very fine skydiver.

30:55.360 --> 30:58.011
She didn't seem like
the skydiver type to me.

31:01.240 --> 31:08.362
I remember she wore this
red and yellow and blue bright clothes.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.962
And she kind of looked like she worked
at the little hot-dog stand

31:12.080 --> 31:14.048
where they dip the hot dogs.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.528
This girl just does not look like
a skydiver.

31:21.040 --> 31:25.682
JEAN: More than once, people at
the drop zone pegged me as a librarian

31:25.880 --> 31:27.006
and some as a nun.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.522
They were trying to figure out
where I was coming from.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.683
There's this psychologist named Jung.

31:40.800 --> 31:44.930
And he always talked about
the marriage of opposites, right?

31:45.040 --> 31:48.249
And if you wanted
the diametric opposite of Carl Boenish

31:48.360 --> 31:49.521
that would be Jean Boenish.

31:52.720 --> 31:59.729
JEAN: I had that thoughtful demeanor,
and Carl did too.

31:59.840 --> 32:05.370
We were both very analytical,
very detail oriented,

32:05.480 --> 32:10.520
and interested in
an intelligent approach to everything.

32:10.680 --> 32:17.086
We were two people who were
a very good coupling. A unique coupling.

32:17.200 --> 32:22.809
We were very well fit for each other
and we loved each other very much.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.367
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
here we are.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.403
I am interviewing you live

32:27.520 --> 32:32.651
from the church of the marriage
of Jean and Carl Boenish.

32:32.800 --> 32:36.282
Jean, would you like to come here
and say a word? Quick. Hurry, hurry.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.643
We ran out of tape. And this is...

32:41.320 --> 32:44.529
Alright, one word. I don't know
what I've gotten myself into.

32:44.640 --> 32:48.770
- One word is, "I do!"
- Those are two words.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.764
JEAN: When I was considering
BASE jumping,

32:53.880 --> 32:56.247
when it was presented to me by Carl,

32:56.360 --> 33:02.083
it was something that struck me
as pleasant as camping.

33:04.360 --> 33:09.526
MAN: One of the most interesting and
incomprehensible love stories ever.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.404
But they got along great.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.330
She was sort of the brains
of the operation.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.771
JEAN: So I was marrying into
his established business

33:19.880 --> 33:24.807
and joining him in partnership
as the team.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.046
Fifteen seconds!

33:30.720 --> 33:33.371
Camera goes on at five. Here you go.

33:33.480 --> 33:38.407
Five, four, three, two, one, go!

33:38.520 --> 33:40.488
There she goes!

33:41.720 --> 33:45.042
(WHOOPS) Alright!

33:45.160 --> 33:47.208
JEAN:
It was a wonderful thing for both of us

33:47.320 --> 33:52.167
to begin our life
working together on a daily basis.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.681
Beautiful. Perfect form. Oh, man.

33:54.880 --> 33:58.965
Hey, Carl. it went really well.
Let me tell you something, though.

33:59.160 --> 34:02.369
It takes more than four seconds to open.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.608
Well, at least the count of four
when you're scared.

34:04.720 --> 34:08.610
Roger. I copy. Yeah, I'll tell you...

34:08.719 --> 34:10.484
You had such flawless form.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.806
You were rock steady.
Everything went mint.

34:12.920 --> 34:16.322
<i>You make a hard act to follow, Jeanie.
That was flawless stability.</i>

34:16.440 --> 34:19.284
<i>I'm going to try to do the same thing.
Even I bend the knee.</i>

34:19.400 --> 34:22.370
<i>It's pretty easy, though.
Have a good one.</i>

34:22.480 --> 34:23.719
<i>Okay duke.</i>

34:23.840 --> 34:27.731
It's a rush, you know? I'm using
the word scared because it's not...

34:27.840 --> 34:30.081
When you're counting the seconds,
it's not that.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.965
It's just that you seem to count
extra fast.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.690
It's what skydivers call a rush.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.002
You jump off
and there's absolutely nothing

34:38.120 --> 34:39.724
because you can't work with anything.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.400
You're at the mercy of nothing.
You're falling.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.362
Jean Boenish,
if I saw her in the street,

34:45.520 --> 34:47.204
the last thing in the world
I would think

34:47.320 --> 34:49.846
is that she would put a parachute on
and jump off a rock.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.928
But she believed and loved him so much,

34:52.080 --> 34:56.927
and if Carl said that you could
jump off a cliff, do this, she did it.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.811
And she did it better than
most of the men at the time.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.490
CARL: Well, we're kind of used
to people calling us crazy.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.410
But at least in our opinion,
we're not crazy.

35:07.520 --> 35:11.844
We're basically fun-loving adventurers
and we really have fun skydiving.

35:12.040 --> 35:15.931
It's almost become a way of life for us,
we take it so seriously.

35:16.040 --> 35:19.647
Interestingly enough,
if it weren't for the camera,

35:19.800 --> 35:23.247
I, personally, probably wouldn't be
that interested in skydiving.

35:23.360 --> 35:27.206
Because the camera captures
something not only for ourselves

35:27.320 --> 35:31.166
but for everybody,
over a vast amount of time.

35:31.280 --> 35:36.411
And it's really a sense of creativity
that we do a lot of things in skydiving

35:36.520 --> 35:38.284
just for the sake of the camera,

35:38.400 --> 35:40.721
and hence for millions of people,
to see what we do.

35:43.160 --> 35:47.085
BOB: Pretty much all the BASE jumping
was called into the Manor Drive house.

35:47.240 --> 35:50.050
"We're going to go jump El Capitan
at six o'clock tomorrow morning."

35:50.200 --> 35:51.247
"Want to come and film?"

35:54.040 --> 35:58.284
<i>Carl and Jean, this is Mary Todd.
Well, I'm over here.</i>

35:58.400 --> 36:02.849
<i>We did El Cap yesterday
and it just went so fantastic.</i>

36:02.960 --> 36:05.042
<i>Piece of cake. Everything.</i>

36:05.240 --> 36:09.609
<i>As you can tell, nothing happened.
No rangers.</i>

36:09.720 --> 36:13.281
BOB: Soto say he was a ringleader,
yes, he didn't tell people to go jump

36:13.440 --> 36:15.727
but he knew about it.

36:15.840 --> 36:20.164
Even though we had had problems
with the National Park Service

36:20.320 --> 36:25.406
as far as arrests or people
wanting to fine or prohibit,

36:25.520 --> 36:30.765
BASE jumping
was not an illegal activity.

36:30.880 --> 36:34.123
And in the park service specifically,

36:34.280 --> 36:36.806
it should easily have been
a permitted activity.

36:36.960 --> 36:41.010
Currently it's pretty illegal to jump
off of the top of most of those cliffs.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.964
And I know that you've been instrumental
in fighting that.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.320
What's going on with that now?

36:45.440 --> 36:47.681
Is that going to be legalized
in your opinion?

36:47.800 --> 36:50.406
Well, we hope that in time,
just like mountain climbing,

36:50.560 --> 36:52.528
that it will be unregulated.

36:52.640 --> 36:56.531
Right now, we want to work
hand in hand with the park service.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.728
WENDT: We both wanted the same thing.
To legalize it.

37:03.840 --> 37:08.368
To reduce the danger
of jumping illegally.

37:08.480 --> 37:12.451
Because they're doing it at night.
Trying to evade us.

37:13.320 --> 37:17.086
MAN: Bill Wendt is the National Park
Service director for Yosemite.

37:17.280 --> 37:21.080
El Capitan happens to be
inside of Yosemite National Park.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.607
And it's one of the few cliffs
in the world

37:23.760 --> 37:25.842
where they can safely jump
from the top of a cliff

37:25.960 --> 37:28.645
and parachute down
to a suitable landing site.

37:28.760 --> 37:32.128
We have finally, after a year of
negotiating back and forth,

37:32.240 --> 37:35.483
you might say, convinced the park
service that it can be done safely.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.490
The park service is issuing permits.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.688
WENDT: It worked,
and it worked for a while,

38:25.800 --> 38:28.804
but it really started to be untenable.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.685
There were just too many free spirits.

38:32.720 --> 38:36.202
And we had to shut them down.
The ninth of September.

38:36.360 --> 38:39.364
CARL: Jumping off El Capitan
was first unregulated

38:39.480 --> 38:41.687
because it was unthought of.

38:41.800 --> 38:45.521
And then it was regulated
because it was feared.

38:45.640 --> 38:48.246
And then it was banned
because it was abused.

38:48.360 --> 38:52.206
WENDT: We got it started
because I recommended it.

38:52.360 --> 38:55.091
And it was stopped
because I recommended it.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.925
So I'm responsible.

39:00.200 --> 39:03.966
And maybe I was too impatient
and didn't...

39:04.720 --> 39:06.563
That... that I will admit.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.968
It really has no connection
with what we consider

39:14.120 --> 39:16.646
to be an International Aviation sport.

39:16.760 --> 39:20.560
It's more closely related
to circus acrobats and circus tricks.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.847
MAN: OK, the Granite Circus
was one of Carl's dreams.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.451
The last day of jumping,
he wanted to make it spectacular.

39:32.560 --> 39:36.121
So he arranged for one person
to be on stilts, that was me.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.050
Mayfield was going to walk
on his hands, doing a handstand.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.650
Carl was on a pogo stick

39:40.760 --> 39:42.888
and one other guy
was going to be on a skateboard.

39:45.880 --> 39:50.283
I got up on the stilts, made about
two or three steps and I was gone.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.922
It was so cool

40:06.080 --> 40:09.971
that that kind of set my heels in.
I was into BASE jumping.

40:10.080 --> 40:13.209
Even though it wasn't called
BASE jumping at the time.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.482
That was the program for me.

40:17.160 --> 40:20.164
After the permitted season
of jumping from El Capitan,

40:20.280 --> 40:26.049
the number of jumpers interested
doing this activity was growing.

40:26.160 --> 40:31.803
And Carl in his foresight knew
that we needed to be able

40:31.920 --> 40:35.641
to call it something other
than fixed object skydiving

40:35.760 --> 40:39.367
or skydiving from fixed objects
or cliff-jumping.

40:39.560 --> 40:43.121
There were boundaries
beyond just cliffs.

40:43.240 --> 40:47.962
I found some other objects around that
I thought might be interesting to jump.

40:48.080 --> 40:51.004
MAN: Phil Smith, Smitty,
came up with a couple ideas.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.566
One of them was jumping off TV towers.

40:53.720 --> 40:57.691
He had a TV tower in Houston
that was over a thousand feet high.

40:59.320 --> 41:03.325
He also mentioned that there was a
building going up at a construction

41:03.560 --> 41:07.929
that was ultimately going to be
about 900 feet high, a little bit more.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.485
One thing led to another.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.649
Carl and Jean decided to come out
in January of 1981.

41:13.520 --> 41:16.922
The four of us would go down
and jump the TV tower.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.121
That was the prime focus.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.481
The building had been mentioned
almost in passing.

41:20.600 --> 41:23.080
It seemed like not having done
either one

41:23.240 --> 41:26.289
that a TV tower jump would be
a lot more feasible than a building

41:26.480 --> 41:29.131
just because of the logistics
of getting onto a building.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.002
Smitty did all the homework
and lined it up for us.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.646
And by that I mean figured out
when we need to be there

41:34.840 --> 41:37.571
and how to get onto the tower
because we'd have to climb a fence.

41:37.720 --> 41:40.929
How to get away and how many sets of
cables there were on the tower

41:41.040 --> 41:45.204
so we could avoid hitting those.
Bottom line is we jumped that.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.650
JEAN: Carl and I had traveled out
to Phil Mayfield's house

42:13.800 --> 42:17.122
and we met Phil Smith there as well.

42:17.240 --> 42:21.245
MAYFIELD: And we started talking about
Carl's latest ideas. His grand idea.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.124
His big picture of fixed object jumping.

42:25.040 --> 42:29.090
SMITH: That evening we were up
in Phil's house in Arlington.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.362
And we were planning
our next day's jump.

42:31.480 --> 42:35.371
And Carl had been daydreaming all week
and brainstorming this thing.

42:35.480 --> 42:37.847
He came up with the idea
of making an organization

42:37.960 --> 42:39.485
where to be a member,

42:39.640 --> 42:42.371
you had to have jumped
these four different kinds of objects.

42:42.560 --> 42:48.249
MAYFIELD: So we started brainstorming
different acronyms, different names

42:48.360 --> 42:51.364
so that we could come up with
something that was kind of catchy.

42:51.480 --> 42:55.804
I don't really know who came up with it,
but it evolved into the word BASE.

42:55.920 --> 42:59.527
And all of the guys instantly
just grabbed hold of BASE

42:59.680 --> 43:02.001
and said, "Well, that's the one."

43:02.120 --> 43:04.282
- MAN: What's your group called?
- CARL: We don't...

43:04.440 --> 43:06.329
Crazy Men of the World.
No, what are you called?

43:06.520 --> 43:08.921
That's what most people call us.

43:09.040 --> 43:11.168
But we've got an organization.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.770
We have to be members of it

43:12.880 --> 43:16.123
although we don't have a roster
of official members yet.

43:16.280 --> 43:17.691
It's too new an organization.

43:17.800 --> 43:22.044
The type of jumping that we do,
first of all, is called BASE jumping.

43:22.200 --> 43:28.731
B-A-S-E is an acronym for Buildings,
Antennae Towers, Spans and Earth.

43:28.840 --> 43:32.049
SMITH: So at that time nobody had
jumped off four things.

43:32.160 --> 43:35.721
We had kind of planned
to do the building in Houston.

43:36.920 --> 43:40.003
At that time, it was called
Texas Commerce Tower.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.283
You jumped off a cliff. What's next?
I heard you want to jump off buildings.

43:43.400 --> 43:46.882
Well, yes. It's just mankind's spirit
that's bubbling out saying,

43:47.000 --> 43:48.923
"if there are mountains
let's climb them."

43:49.040 --> 43:52.522
"if there are buildings,
let's jump off of them."

43:52.680 --> 43:54.842
SMITH: Houston was going through
a lot of growth.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.769
They were building several new buildings

43:56.880 --> 43:58.644
that would be
about a thousand feet high.

43:58.760 --> 44:00.649
At that time,
that was kind of our criteria.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.882
I didn't want to do
much lower than that.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.482
The nice thing about those buildings is
when a building is under construction,

44:06.640 --> 44:09.723
they're really vulnerable
to people like us.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.722
Often the building would have
just a chain-link fence around it.

44:17.880 --> 44:21.441
You could just pull it apart and find
someplace to get in or climb over it.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.768
It was really easy to do.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.808
There is a stairway, no elevator.

44:33.920 --> 44:37.367
But there's a stairway and we just
went up to the top, no problem.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.642
With Carl Boenish,
you have to understand

44:39.760 --> 44:42.081
the number-one thing is the film.

44:42.240 --> 44:45.449
So it didn't matter the security
of getting away and making the jump

44:45.600 --> 44:48.570
and getting all that stuff;
that was secondary to getting that film.

44:48.760 --> 44:51.809
So we got in there real early. We could
have made a jump then and got out

44:51.920 --> 44:54.048
but the light wouldn't have been good.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.842
So we always had to wait on Carl
for perfect light.

44:58.960 --> 45:02.362
About the time we started seeing a
little bit of traffic down the streets,

45:02.480 --> 45:06.201
Carl let us know that time
is right. The conditions are good.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.728
Once we put the jumpsuits on and
the cameras on and plugged them in,

45:09.840 --> 45:13.049
we knew that it was just about the time.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.325
As soon as we got the go-ahead,
"OK, we're ready down there."

45:25.440 --> 45:28.842
"The helicopter's ready.
OK, you guys, we're waiting on you."

45:28.960 --> 45:31.770
We knew that we had to start
the countdown, turn the cameras on.

45:35.960 --> 45:38.008
I didn't want to screw up.
Neither one of us did.

45:39.880 --> 45:45.250
OK. Five, four, three, two, one.

45:55.400 --> 45:59.962
The thing that I remember most was
looking down as I was pushing out

46:00.080 --> 46:02.401
at the windows on each floor going by.

46:02.520 --> 46:05.603
The first second,
I saw two or three go by.

46:05.760 --> 46:08.650
Then by the third second
they're going by just incredibly fast.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.041
(MAKES WHOOSHING SOUNDS)

46:12.760 --> 46:15.127
Step off and then...
(EXHALES)

46:21.520 --> 46:24.490
You'll see the building behind you
or the cliff or whatever it is.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.449
As it just goes...
(MAKES WHOOSHING SOUND)

46:31.280 --> 46:33.806
MAYFIELD: I let go of my pilot chute,
which opens my canopy,

46:33.920 --> 46:35.809
because I see Smitty's over here.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.649
His is already starting to string out.

46:37.800 --> 46:41.850
I let mine go.
I opened probably 150 feet below him.

46:41.960 --> 46:45.487
And just as soon as I got open
and I was not facing the building,

46:45.600 --> 46:47.887
I breathed an enormous sigh of relief.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.571
Because now the whole thing is over.
All the danger is over.

46:50.720 --> 46:52.927
All I got to do is land
and hopefully get away.

46:53.080 --> 46:55.811
But even if I don't get away,
if I get detained by the police

46:55.960 --> 46:58.281
because I was trespassing,
I'm OK with that.

47:38.280 --> 47:41.966
So Phil Mayfield and I,
I guess we skyrocketed into history

47:42.080 --> 47:45.163
and made the first completed
BASE members.

47:45.280 --> 47:48.011
MAN:
Phil Smith is BASE jumper number one.

47:48.160 --> 47:51.289
He was the first person to jump
all four required objects

47:51.400 --> 47:53.641
and has since made
over 50 successful leaps.

47:53.760 --> 47:57.560
Skydiving then was just as much
a challenge as BASE jumping is now.

47:57.680 --> 48:00.411
So it's that challenge
that we're seeking.

48:00.600 --> 48:05.925
And we really want to...
We want to expand our environment

48:06.040 --> 48:08.281
to include bigger
and more and greater things.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.404
BASE jumping, there's so many things
out there that haven't been tamed

48:11.520 --> 48:14.330
that I'm really excited to tackle them.

48:14.440 --> 48:18.764
SMITH: 1981, that's when
the BASE program started.

48:18.920 --> 48:23.005
We actually told the public,
told the world, about BASE.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.282
Of course,
it grew exponentially after that.

48:25.400 --> 48:30.042
MAYFIELD: Almost immediately, Carl was
bent on legitimizing it to the world.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.606
Are you bored with your life
nine to five

48:32.760 --> 48:34.842
looking at the clock,
check in, check out?

48:35.040 --> 48:37.850
Look, you only go around once.
You might as well go for it.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.810
MAN: Carl and Jean Boenish are here.
They're BASE jumpers.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.611
You jump off of buildings,
antennae towers and bridges?

48:43.720 --> 48:45.927
Yes. And cliffs.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.168
- And you're both crazy.
- No, we're not.

48:48.320 --> 48:52.006
As the equipment got better
and word spread about this thing

48:52.120 --> 48:54.441
then the numbers began
really accelerating.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.210
Then it became a worldwide thing.

48:56.320 --> 49:00.041
Not just the United States
or not just Texas and California.

49:00.160 --> 49:01.764
It took off.

49:28.560 --> 49:36.047
MAN: The still uncompleted 54-storey
Crocker Center in downtown LA

49:36.200 --> 49:39.727
may have seen the last skydiver
jump from its lofty heights.

49:39.840 --> 49:42.844
A group of intrepid divers have been
climbing to the top of the building

49:43.040 --> 49:45.168
and parachuting off
for about four months.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.248
But always at two or three
in the morning.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.931
The jumpers say it's a new sport
called BASE diving.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.485
Police aren't sure what to call it.

49:51.600 --> 49:55.286
But they say there's no law against it,
except maybe trespassing.

49:55.400 --> 50:00.611
Question: why did you jump
off the Crocker Center building

50:00.720 --> 50:03.087
in downtown Los Angeles?

50:03.200 --> 50:07.364
Answer: because it was there
and a lot of fun.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.881
Carl, how can you justify breaking
the law to jump that building?

50:13.080 --> 50:16.050
Answer: what laws am I breaking?

50:16.240 --> 50:19.210
He assigned a lot more importance
to the laws of nature

50:19.360 --> 50:20.407
than he did the laws of man.

50:20.520 --> 50:24.605
The laws of man, in Carl's eyes,
were temporary at best.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.966
JEAN: There were buildings
in downtown Los Angeles

50:29.080 --> 50:30.809
that were under construction.

50:30.960 --> 50:35.045
The Crocker Center happened
to start construction

50:35.160 --> 50:38.482
when we were interested
in jumping off of buildings.

50:38.600 --> 50:42.082
CARL: Well, you know, Jean and I
have each jumped from a building.

50:42.240 --> 50:45.210
A thousand-foot, 75-story skyscraper.

50:45.360 --> 50:47.249
And people say why?

50:47.400 --> 50:49.243
Why did you do it, Jean?

50:49.360 --> 50:51.044
I actually do it for the fun of it.

50:51.160 --> 50:53.970
It's the feeling that you get
when you jump off of a high dive.

50:54.080 --> 50:55.570
There's nothing to push against

50:55.720 --> 50:57.927
like when you're swimming
through the water.

50:58.080 --> 51:00.606
You are falling, literally,
for the first two seconds.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.324
And you can't control your fall.

51:02.440 --> 51:06.445
That's why you have to be very careful
in the manner in which you exit.

51:06.560 --> 51:12.681
One morning, Carl had gone
to do an early morning jump

51:12.800 --> 51:14.609
after it was already light.

51:14.720 --> 51:17.326
MAN: Yesterday three men jumped off
the unfinished building,

51:17.440 --> 51:21.081
the Cracker building in Los Angeles,
in their sport of skydiving.

51:21.200 --> 51:24.010
And today I talked to one of the three,
Carl Boenish.

51:24.160 --> 51:27.289
You're standing there and no matter
how seasoned a skydiver you are,

51:27.400 --> 51:30.370
or a BASE jumper, you're very
apprehensive and you're nervous.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.522
But you know in your mind you can do it,

51:32.640 --> 51:35.120
even though your physical body
says you'd better not do it.

51:35.240 --> 51:37.402
I mean, that's 700 feet straight down.

51:37.560 --> 51:40.848
So finally you say,
"Here we go. Ready, set, go."

51:40.960 --> 51:45.090
And the first second you start
accelerating incredibly fast.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.965
It leaves you almost breathless.

51:48.160 --> 51:53.405
And then the second second you
have a feeling of freedom and power

51:53.520 --> 51:56.126
and confidence, almost euphoria.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.681
You think, "Wow, I feel like Superman."

52:00.200 --> 52:04.444
JEAN: The next day, the <i>LA</i> Times
had this photograph of Carl

52:04.640 --> 52:07.325
right on the front page
jumping off of Crocker Center.

52:07.440 --> 52:09.169
Plain as day, literally.

52:14.600 --> 52:16.364
<i>Mr Boenish, my name is Fred Gooch.</i>

52:16.480 --> 52:20.371
<i>I'm an attorney for the owner
of the Crocker Center.</i>

52:20.480 --> 52:25.691
<i>I want to advise you
that at 1 :30 tomorrow afternoon</i>

52:25.800 --> 52:29.850
<i>in department 85 to the
Los Angeles County Superior Court,</i>

52:30.000 --> 52:34.927
<i>the owners of the property are going
to seek an injunction against you.</i>

52:35.040 --> 52:39.489
<i>An X party application for a temporary
restraining order against you,</i>

52:39.600 --> 52:42.410
<i>members of your group,
and any other skydivers</i>

52:42.520 --> 52:45.922
<i>from jumping off of the Cracker Center.</i>

52:46.040 --> 52:50.568
<i>I suggest that you have your attorney
call me.</i>

52:50.680 --> 52:52.808
And I pick up the <i>LA</i> Times one day

52:52.920 --> 52:55.890
and I see this picture of somebody
jumping off Crocker Bank.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.241
And I read the article
and, OK, that's Carl.

52:58.400 --> 53:01.404
Then a day or two later I get
this phone call from Carl saying,

53:01.520 --> 53:04.444
"Jim, I think I'm in
a little bit of trouble."

53:05.480 --> 53:07.608
Here's the message.

53:07.720 --> 53:12.044
<i>Carl and Jean, this is Jim Winkler.</i>

53:12.200 --> 53:15.124
<i>Give me a call as soon as possible.</i>

53:15.280 --> 53:18.489
<i>Cracker Bank apparently
does not want to settle.</i>

53:18.640 --> 53:23.089
JEAN: They wanted to get control
over this situation.

53:23.200 --> 53:26.807
So the Crocker Center decided that
they wanted to start legal proceedings

53:26.960 --> 53:31.568
specifically against Carl
because he was named in the newspaper.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.762
BOB: They couldn't catch him
most of the time.

53:34.880 --> 53:39.761
Then, when he was caught,
I would guess the prosecutor at the time

53:39.880 --> 53:42.486
basically told the judge,
"We know this guy's doing this."

53:42.640 --> 53:45.803
So the court ordered that
he could not go into anything

53:45.920 --> 53:49.720
over a 30-story building
without a judge's approval.

53:49.880 --> 53:52.645
CARL: Why do you do your homework
and know what you're doing?

53:52.760 --> 53:57.049
A lot of us do this day in and day out
and we do it very systematically.

53:57.240 --> 54:01.484
The difference in attention to detail
is being a hero or being dead.

54:03.840 --> 54:06.366
MAN: Some BASE jumps are illegal,
others are not.

54:06.480 --> 54:07.891
Tomorrow in Memphis, Tennessee,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.162
as part of that city's annual
Cotton Carnival

54:10.320 --> 54:12.049
BASE jumpers Jean and Carl Boenish

54:12.160 --> 54:15.642
plan to parachute from the top
of a downtown office building.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.570
JEAN: That building is called
the Hundred North Main Building

54:18.680 --> 54:23.720
and it's 432 feet
to the top of the 36th floor.

54:23.840 --> 54:26.650
A man came up and introduced himself.

54:26.760 --> 54:31.687
He happened to also be the president
of the Union Planters Bank Building,

54:31.800 --> 54:35.850
which was the largest building
in Memphis, Tennessee.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.050
And he said, "Would you like
to jump off of that building

54:40.160 --> 54:41.400
for the Cotton Carnival?"

54:41.520 --> 54:44.364
Carl and I just looked at each other.

54:44.480 --> 54:47.370
We both turned back to him
and we said,

54:47.480 --> 54:51.280
"Well, that would be great.
We'd be very interested in doing that."

54:51.440 --> 54:53.363
They had a parade

54:53.560 --> 54:58.361
and they had arranged for Carl and I
to ride on one of the floats

54:58.520 --> 55:03.162
so that we would be
the co-grand marshals of the parade.

55:03.320 --> 55:05.721
(CARNIVAL MUSIC)

55:20.160 --> 55:26.964
So we were co-grand marshals and our
job was to jump down from the building

55:27.080 --> 55:29.287
with crystal medallions

55:29.400 --> 55:34.645
that were made especially for the king
and queen of the Cotton Carnival.

55:34.760 --> 55:37.331
LONG: If you were around the Boenishes
long enough

55:37.440 --> 55:40.011
you got the feeling of people
that really didn't belong.

55:41.200 --> 55:43.680
They weren't weird, alright.
They were different.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.882
A little eccentric, even.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.844
They didn't really fit anywhere, right?

55:50.000 --> 55:51.126
See you at the bottom.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.725
But they fit together.

55:52.840 --> 55:54.683
Here we go.

55:54.800 --> 56:01.001
Five, four, three, two, one, go!

57:28.640 --> 57:30.483
We've just reached the Trollveggen,

57:30.600 --> 57:33.524
which is the largest cliff face
in Europe.

57:33.640 --> 57:38.282
It'll be the site for our assault
on the world BASE jumping record.

57:38.440 --> 57:41.842
Standing over here on this ledge
is Carl Boenish and his wife, Jean.

57:41.960 --> 57:44.645
They're about to fling themselves
off the mountain

57:44.760 --> 57:46.603
in something called BASE jumping.

57:46.720 --> 57:53.330
At that time, I was a recently
graduated dude with no career

57:53.480 --> 57:56.882
from graduate school
studying literature and philosophy.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.243
I had no idea what I was going to do
other than what I had been doing

58:00.360 --> 58:03.125
which was rock climbing and sea kayaking

58:03.280 --> 58:06.250
and generally doing things
that were really fun that made no money.

58:06.400 --> 58:10.007
So I just took my expertise in adventure
and applied it to production,

58:10.120 --> 58:12.930
and I ended up working for David Frost.

58:13.040 --> 58:17.284
We needed to have a centerpiece
for an ABC special.

58:17.400 --> 58:19.846
That special being
The Guinness Book <i>of World</i> Records

58:20.000 --> 58:24.847
which showed on ABC and also on BBC.
We needed to have a centerpiece thing,

58:24.960 --> 58:27.770
which was an international
big action-adventure thing

58:27.880 --> 58:29.644
that could carry the whole show.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.888
I figured BASE jumping
was going to be it.

58:32.000 --> 58:36.528
JEAN: Carl was thrilled to be contacted
by the Guinness people

58:36.680 --> 58:38.842
and given the opportunity it was...

58:38.960 --> 58:42.407
This was really an opportunity
being given to us.

58:42.560 --> 58:45.370
Meeting Carl Boenish was...

58:48.520 --> 58:50.682
...not like anything
I'd ever experienced.

58:50.800 --> 58:54.441
By that time, I had been in New Guinea
and the fricking North Pole.

58:54.600 --> 58:59.128
I'd been all over and had seen just
about every kind of person imaginable.

58:59.240 --> 59:01.368
But I had never seen anybody
like Carl Boenish.

59:03.560 --> 59:07.121
Super energetic.
He had plans to do everything

59:07.240 --> 59:10.084
and he documented everything,
he had pictures of everything.

59:10.200 --> 59:14.922
He was everything. Everything about Carl
was out there right from the beginning.

59:15.040 --> 59:17.008
And it was like running into a geyser.

59:17.120 --> 59:20.124
It was just like,
"Whoa, look at this guy!" You know?

59:20.280 --> 59:21.930
Carl, what's the old record?

59:22.040 --> 59:24.771
The tallest BASE jump ever made
is 4900 feet.

59:24.880 --> 59:27.724
And that was made at Half Dome
at Yosemite National Park.

59:27.840 --> 59:30.969
High by anybody's standards. Jean,
what are you going to attempt today?

59:31.080 --> 59:33.401
Well, I'm not exactly sure
what the height is here

59:33.560 --> 59:35.881
but it's definitely over 4900 feet.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.889
- All the best to you both.
- Thank you.

59:39.600 --> 59:43.685
JEAN: When they said let's go and do
a record jump,

59:43.800 --> 59:46.007
let's find a site that's the highest

59:46.120 --> 59:49.044
from point of launch
to point of landing.

59:49.160 --> 59:51.970
And where would you like to go
and do that?

59:52.080 --> 59:56.085
The world was our oyster
and we chose Norway.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.162
Norway. Norway's beautiful.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.845
And the people are wonderful.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.602
And, as they say,
there's a very open trust.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.724
That's Norway.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.488
It was like mounting an expedition,
really.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.165
We were pretty much involved in that

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.563
from the time that he said
he could and would do it

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.731
until the time we left which is, I don't
know, two and a half weeks later,

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.405
it was pretty much a mad dash.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.524
I flew across the Atlantic and went to
London and spent a day there.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.286
Took a flight up to Oslo and
the Boenishes were already there.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.404
I just jumped in a rental car with them
and we drove up to Andalsnes

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.090
which took all day.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.722
It was that time of year where
the nights weren't really nights.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.842
There's a midnight sun kind of thing.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.531
So the sun never really totally set.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.042
So we just kept driving
and driving and driving.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.687
That went on for eight hours
and we ended up in Andalsnes

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.404
and I saw this cliff for the first time.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.603
I said, "Wow,
that's going to be interesting."

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.121
It's a scary sort of place.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.047
It's like Sleepy Hollow with
these huge cliffs rising on both sides.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.202
Really formidable
and really intimidating.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.088
And it was really bad weather. It was
just drizzly and cloudy and weird.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.363
I wasn't real enthusiastic that
it was going to break any time soon.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.164
Wasn't necessarily a bad thing.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.046
I knew it would take us a little while
to figure out what we were going to do

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.049
and where we were going to jump.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.881
One glance up there and I knew
it was going to take me a while

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.401
to get fluent with the whole area.
it was just too big.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.245
It was too big
and too confusing up there.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.045
So I was lucky enough
to meet with a friend.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.128
He had climbed around here a whole lot.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.882
He was not only a great sort of partner
and climber

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.606
but a really decent, soulful guy.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.929
We got along perfectly
from the beginning.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.721
We hooked up and every day we'd hike up
the back side of Trollveggen,

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.525
go up there marching around
looking for places to go.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.484
MAN: I started climbing when I was 15

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:25.128
and I've been doing a lot of climbing
in the area here in Romsdal.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:31.771
I first met Carl when the others
asked me to be a local guide

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.521
and be responsible
for the security up in the mountains

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.130
while they were doing the parachute.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.131
I really didn't know what's going on
then, what they were going to do.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:46.280
But it was really a exciting time
to be together with them.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.601
I remember his leg.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.810
That he had hurt it once
and broke it, I think.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.083
And that he did not go to a doctor.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.164
LONG: When Fred and I first started
hiking up to the top of Troll Wall

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.090
to figure out a location
where we're going to jump,

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.205
Carl went along with us
but he was such a slow hiker

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.848
that ultimately we decided most
of the time to go up there without him

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.082
because he just couldn't keep up.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.602
Carl, when he got up into the mountains,

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.246
had some problems with his leg
all the time.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.121
He got very tired because
it was hurting very much, I think.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.163
LONG: I go, "What what's with this guy?"

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.961
"Why is he going so fricking slow?"
It was driving me crazy.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.289
It'd take half the day to get up
to the top of the cliff, right?

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.210
And I thought he was just lazy.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.370
And finally there's a little stone hut

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.166
that you can sort of take shelter in
on your way up.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.607
And we got about halfway up
and we got to the stone hut

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.923
and it started raining
so we had to actually go in this hut.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.885
We went in this hut. We're sitting down
and Carl's rubbing his leg.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.128
I go, "What's going on?
What's up, Carl?"

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.245
And he pulls his pant leg up
and his leg has this...

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.563
The bone goes down like this
and takes this jog.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.564
I'm like,
"Carl what's going on with that leg?"

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.887
And it turned out he'd broken his leg.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.085
He'd broken his leg hang gliding
a couple years before.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.410
And he'd never got it set
because he's a Christian Scientist.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.568
I didn't know anything
about any of that.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.167
CARL: I believe that there's a law
and order to the universe.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.248
Some people call it God.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.600
I don't care what you call it.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.525
I just know that mathematics
never fails us.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.809
If we get the wrong answer,
we didn't apply something correctly.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.682
Nothing happens by chance.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.885
Every single thing that ever happens,
happens for a reason.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.651
Happens due to the law of the universe.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.289
LONG:
One of the things I kept looking for

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.529
was someplace that was
cantilevered out like that.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.487
So we found this thing,
Stabben pinnacle.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.410
We get to the top and
there's a bunch of big boulders around.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.490
What you do is you do
what's called a rock test.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.211
And what you want
is something that falls

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.325
somewhere between 15 and 20 seconds
before it hits the wall.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.287
The whole thing with BASE jumping
is you don't want to hit the wall.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.687
That's what's going to kill you.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.804
Fred and I pushed ten rocks
off the top of Stabben pinnacle

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.601
and they all hit between
three and five seconds.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.087
Every time.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.010
We did the rock test
and immediately ruled that out

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.645
as something we would do.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.691
Carl goes, "No, it's too dangerous.
it doesn't give it enough time."

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.761
There was quite a lot of people
because it was a big team

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.450
and they had all the helicopters.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:49.451
So it was both local people that was
going up to see what was going on

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.050
and there was a lot of tourists

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.881
that were stopping because of the
helicopter traffic that was going on.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.808
LONG:
It was a big event in Europe also.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.123
So news teams
from all over Europe were here

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.766
waiting for this thing to happen.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.564
I mean, it was a zoo.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.644
I was hoping to be able to do this thing
sort of on a low profile.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:19.209
But by the time the thing finally
happened, it was no secret to anybody.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.883
The Boenishes were both...
Well, Jean, it was hard to tell

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.526
because she seemingly never got
excited about anything.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:32.363
But Carl was coming out of his skin.
You know, like uncontainable enthusiasm.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.642
This is a celebration of
the human spirit

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.804
and thank you for bringing
your spirits too.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.924
Take a shot of Jean and me
and the crowd.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.642
Put it on Infinity.
You have it on Infinity?

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.290
OK, look at the camera.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.250
No, it's the other button.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.688
LONG: I mean, it's like a geyser,
you know? Just like Old Faithful.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.764
The day prior to when
we really got the thing on film,

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:06.329
he had done the jump basically
at night already, and done it perfectly.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.330
So we knew that everything
was going to be perfect.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.046
As soon as the sun comes up,
he can do this jump.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.447
We're going to get it a couple times
so we got it covered,

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.607
then we're out of there.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.241
Carl's enthusiasm was so high,
everybody was really high on this thing.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.922
Remember, BASE jumping had never been
filmed on any kind of big scale.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.289
It was little teeny 16mm documentaries

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.960
that people showed
on their bathroom wall.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.081
And a huge network television crew
had swooped in here

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.124
with an internationally famous star,
David Frost.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.601
<i>He was the host
of The Guinness Book of World Records</i>

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.406
and all this hoopla right?
And, boom, we have six cameras.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.002
I think Boenish had another couple
cameras. We had cameras everywhere.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.811
This is going to be a big event.
Everything was going great.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.123
Everybody was enthusiastic.
It was sort of a big thing.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.010
Then we got up, the sun was perfect.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.441
It was a perfect bluebird day.
That was lucky enough.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.484
We got everybody in position
in a matter of a couple hours.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.369
DAVID FROST: They're getting ready now.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:11.081
The Boenishes approaching
the jumping off spot, coming out there.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.767
And the pilot is doing a fantastic job.
It's very difficult right there.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.169
He seems to be balancing that helicopter
almost on one skid.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:22.323
And there are the Boenishes over there.
There they are.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:25.444
Perched on that very, very tiny outcrop.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.282
Now with the help of our key mountain
climber, cameraman as well,

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:33.529
they're making their final
equipment checks.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:37.611
Thirty seconds.

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:39.645
Are you ready?

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.767
- Twenty seconds.
- Twenty seconds.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.968
Ten seconds.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.046
Are you ready?

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:06.240
Five, four, three, two, one, go!

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.642
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.081
Let's find Carl now.
He's a little behind.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.207
JEAN: He was very enthusiastic.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:41.125
WOMAN: There he is.
Alright! Perfect landing!

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:44.283
JEAN: He was always enthusiastic
about all of his projects.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:49.327
Particularly after a jump was finished
or the film was in the can.

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:51.408
Terrific. Congratulations.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.046
- Thank you very much.
- That really excited him.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.444
It was exciting. Wow. Wow.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.489
That's a jump of a lifetime.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.770
Well, did you see how much lift
this big parachute has?

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.089
- I was staying up forever.
- Listen, just by landing safely,

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.409
that means you have set now
a new world's record for BASE jumping.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.443
Norris, do you have the exact figures?

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.326
At least 400 feet further
than any other BASE jump in history.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.444
And the speed,
because you deployed so late,

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.643
it was like flashing through
a 20-story building in one second.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.368
Carl was really enthusiastic
about having finished the jumps.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.970
To see that wall rushing by.
Man, we loved it.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.449
And for Carl, too, to have been able
to make a record jump.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:02.165
It was like, "Let's get out of here
before the mountain falls on top of us."

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.367
I just had this feeling of doom

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.689
hanging over something
that was potentially that sketchy.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.450
So the moment they are over,

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.570
as though retroactively
something could happen,

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:17.883
and combined with the fact
that that was the last piece

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.008
that we needed to do on the show,

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.967
both of those combined and in concert
gave everybody a reason to get...

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.885
It put jet underneath everybody.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.082
They were gone. Barn! Out of there.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.488
JEAN: After our record jumps,
we were both really tired

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.367
because we had been up for
a number of days with very little sleep.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.689
Particularly
in the last 24 hours or more.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.684
It was one o'clock in the morning
and it was not dark.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:03.250
We really had a great deal of difficulty
in this midnight sun situation.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.847
We had a short night that night.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.806
I was...

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.088
...tired from the jumps the day before.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.644
And I told him I was going to sleep in

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:04.005
and he had decided he wanted
to go and jump the Bruraskaret

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.448
which was the normally jumped site,
so I didn't think much of it.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.964
But I was grousing a bit.
"You're tired. Why don't you stay?"

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.731
"Why do you have
to go do this right now,

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.528
right today, when you're tired?
Stay here and sleep."

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.611
That morning that Carl left for the jump
as I was lying in bed,

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.563
I was grumping at him

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:31.811
that I didn't think that he should be
doing this because he must be tired.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.604
And that was the way

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:40.291
I was expressing my feelings
and my intuitions about it.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:47.449
If I had had 30 years more
of experience that I have now,

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:52.646
perhaps I would have expressed
my feelings in a different way

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:58.005
and understood that there was
a message there for me.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.324
That it was not a good idea
for him to do this.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.969
That's the honest truth about it. And...

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.362
I can only look at it in hindsight
from here.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.722
HUSOY: There was two locals.
Friends of mine that followed them up.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.401
And also Jean was aware
that he was going up, of course,

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:37.602
but somewhere on the route
they decided to go for Stabben instead.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.081
His foot made much trouble for him

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.402
because I'd seen that
in earlier days as well,

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.963
that he was having problems when
we were walking up in the rough terrain.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.527
It was quite rough
up in the back of the Trolltind.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.924
And it was a decision he took
there and then

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.250
to get back down an easy way, I think.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.409
LONG: The fact is we had done the record
jump, filmed it,

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.564
and not more than 12 hours later,
he had hiked back up there.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.524
That didn't make any sense to me.
I don't know how that was possible.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.884
The fact we heard he'd done Stabben
didn't make any sense

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.245
because we had agreed when we did
the rock-drop test that it was suicidal.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.206
Nobody could survive that jump.
Why had he done that?

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.164
Why was it that
if he was going to go back up

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.409
he didn't ask Fred or I
to go up with him?

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.809
MAN: On Friday night I was on
Grand Hotel at Andalsnes

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:45.246
because Carl had borrowed a room
so he could pack his parachute.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.005
So I and my brother was with him.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:55.241
And they explained a lot about BASE
jumping and how to pack the chute

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.563
so it released quick
and things like that.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.849
It didn't go well that day.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.008
I have an impression that Carl,
more than most of us,

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.728
thought that God had a plan for him
that he had to fulfill.

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.324
I am a person who remembers in pictures

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.048
so I have a small glimpse
of what happened during the day.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.287
Me and my brother,
we picked him up in my brother's car

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.011
where he lived with the Griiners.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.365
I remember driving from the Griiners'
and up to Trollstigen.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.240
It was not so good weather.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.564
It was a little rain and quite windy.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:30.842
We went not so fast because
he had the problem with his leg.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.682
And then we went further up to Stabben.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.203
We climbed up to the pinnacle...

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:48.041
...and sat there for at least...
it was more than a half an hour,

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.242
maybe up to an hour.

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:58.048
He started to throw stones
to measure the height of the wall.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.730
We sat on top of the pinnacle
and chatted

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.845
about different matters of life.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:17.446
On the top of the mountain he asked us
if we knew the story from the Bible.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.723
The Temptation of Jesus.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.882
The Devil brought Jesus to Jerusalem

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.927
and put him on the highest point
of the temple.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:37.250
And he said that
if you throw yourself down,

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:44.721
God will send his angels
and carry you in their arms

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.050
so you will not hurt your foot
on the rock.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:53.967
Jesus answered,
"Do not put the Lord on test."

01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:01.208
Carl just had...
he had a particular laughter.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.130
He pointed to his parachute and he said,

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.084
"This is my angel."

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.089
I think it's really amazing
kind of last words.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:24.403
I don't know what it means
but it feels like it means something.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.210
Finally, he said that he wanted to jump.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:35.409
We prepared our cameras.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:39.569
So I saw his jump through the lens.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.962
I saw the back of the whole body

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.482
more like just his feet diving down.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:00.010
His parachute was stalling
against the mountain.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:07.371
He slid under his parachute
down the mountain

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.648
and stopped in some snow.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.847
No signs of life.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:21.128
No movements or anything
after the parachute stopped.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.968
It was before the days
of the mobile phone.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.206
It was decided my brother
would run down

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.927
to call the police
and start the rescue operation.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.724
I waited, looking down on him,
on top of the mountain.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:59.609
Police district Romsdalen,
on Saturday the 7th of July, '84

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.964
approximately 4:35pm,
I received a call from Arnstein Myskja.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.289
Arnstein explained he was calling
from Trollstigen Fjellstue

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.007
and reported that he had just,
at approximately at 3:50pm,

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:15.370
been a witness to Boenish, Carl Ronald,
jump from Stabben,

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.370
a mountaintop situated
between Trollveggen and Semletind

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.369
in Trolltindmassivet.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.251
The jump had,
for one reason or another, failed

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.809
such that Boenish hit the mountain wall
and was suspended over the valley.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:34.524
MYSKJA: We had brought a camera each,

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.611
and we were taking pictures
when the accident happened.

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:43.123
You get so shocked
you started to think about...

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:46.289
That you don't want to sell the photos.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:50.200
Why don't we have the photos
and just don't sell it?

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.722
It's not more difficult than that.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:59.450
But we decided to destroy the pictures.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.169
Just to open up
and pull it out of the cassette

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.484
so it was fully exposed to the light.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.200
LONG: I went back to where I was staying
after we wrapped.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.484
I think I just laid down. It was
probably still mid to late afternoon

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.046
and I didn't really get up
until the next morning

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.562
when Fred came hammering on my door,

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.047
saying Carl's been in an accident.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.842
Fred came and got me. I got in the car.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.162
We drove down, looked up,
saw Carl's body.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.805
It wasn't moving.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.641
But his red parachute
was sort of billowing in the air.

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.047
He was probably
three quarters of a mile away

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.125
and a couple thousand feet
up the flank of the bottom of the wall.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.004
We went back to the police and said,

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.444
"We're going to have to try and figure
something out to get up to get him."

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.884
They're going to have to call in
a coast guard helicopter, and they did.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:11.165
They had to fly up into the slab
at the bottom of the wall.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:15.444
We couldn't really climb up to it.
It was sort of an isolated area,

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:19.007
but they recovered Carl's body,
brought it on the helicopter.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:24.047
They flew that helicopter down
to the police station and landed.

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.924
Meanwhile,
we hadn't gotten a hold of Jean,

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.607
which was probably not fair to her.

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:36.931
Nobody got a hold of Jean
until the helicopter was on its way.

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.687
I was there with the police officer
and let me tell you,

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:44.282
one of the boldest things
I've ever seen anybody do,

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.205
was to call her up.
I mean, I'll never forget it.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:52.008
This guy is talking on the phone.
He knew that the situation was bad.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:55.329
And he's talking to her
and he was holding it together

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.568
with the last ounce of strength
that he had

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.207
saying your husband
had been involved in an accident

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:02.810
and it doesn't look good.

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:06.561
I'll never forget watching that. God!

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.490
That was awful watching that.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.526
But...

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.646
That was just one of those things
where you just had to watch it

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.810
and deal with it, you know?
It was like, "This is happening."

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.844
"Is this really happening?"
Well, it was, you know?

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.370
JEAN: The police had come. Two of them.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.491
And I met them downstairs
at Griiners' hytter.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:45.767
And they told me that Carl was dead.

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:51.882
Everybody in the room looked at me,
silently.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.166
And I could tell instantly
that it was up to me and my response...

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.962
...to determine the entire atmosphere
that would surround everything

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.521
that would happen
subsequent to this announcement.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.769
At first, I didn't understand
because it didn't make sense

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:14.970
because I still thought
he had jumped from Bruraskaret.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.165
But then as the conversation proceeded,

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:22.529
that was when it was revealed
that he had jumped from Stabben.

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:26.964
And things started to fall into place
in a very different way.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:36.408
So my response may not have been
what they expected because...

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:44.765
...I needed to put on the hat
of finding out what happened.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:48.362
Carl and I were not just husband
and wife. We were professionals.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.760
We were pioneers.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:56.490
We were people working together
in something that was a vital activity.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.083
And as a vital activity that other
people were participating in as well,

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:05.609
the necessity was to find out
what in the world happened.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:09.328
He had a good exit.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:12.728
But somehow obviously
got turned around into the cliff.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:20.042
And that is not a site where
you have achieved the distance

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.164
from the cliff that you need
to be able to handle

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.609
being turned into the cliff
that soon upon opening.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:33.568
I have a picture in my mind of him
lying here with his red helmet on.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:37.730
A blue jacket and also the injuries.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:45.281
He had many bad injuries
and serious injuries both in breast,

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:49.564
head and also the arms and the legs.

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:52.326
I think he died immediately.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:27:00.880
I could see that it looked like Carl,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.288
as far as the presence of the body.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:09.884
But the real Carl
was absolutely clearly not there.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.401
I have seen a lot of dead people,
and dying,

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:16.730
but this particular moment here
is one of the strongest moments

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:22.085
because of his visions, his dreams,
and what he did in Trollveggen.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.481
What Carl did was something that
the whole country was interested in.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:33.846
So it was... it was strange.

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.645
Touching.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.081
It's about...

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:44.045
...limits. Living on the edge.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.326
And, of course, his dreams as I said,
his vision,

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.643
and then suddenly he was here,
lying dead.

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:57.368
And you know, when they are here,
they are really dead.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:07.444
JEAN: After that we got on a ferry

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.131
and it was just, you know, beautiful.

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:15.287
And I cried a little in the car.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.285
And kept driving back to Andalsnes
to Griiners' hytter.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.401
A couple of days after Carl died

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.367
was the day that Erik Fenz
was planning on jumping.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.489
There I was. I was going to jump off
the Troll Wall and Carl dies.

01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:39.126
I'm just, like, holy shit.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.687
But there was something that was,
you know,

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.406
there was something that was
bigger than the moment

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.241
that was driving me to want to continue.

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.923
JEAN: Word spread like wildfire
that Carl had died.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.001
Very quickly people around the world
in the jumping community

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.565
knew what had happened.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.720
And it really, really shocked
and shook so many people.

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.410
I said, "I want to still do it."

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.931
She was like, "I want to do it too.
With you. We're going to go do it."

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:24.603
Not wanting him to seem disrespectful
in making ajump,

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:30.921
it would remove any aura
of seeming disrespect

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:39.403
for me to be the one to be making a jump
first after Carl's death

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:45.010
to show people it's fine, it's OK.

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:49.802
Carl wanted everybody to get on
with their lives after he died

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:53.766
and that there was nothing wrong
with BASE jumping because of this.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.726
We just had to learn from it and go on.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.728
(WOMAN SPEAKING IN NORWEGIAN)

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:55.203
JEAN: As I was under canopy
coming down from that jump

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:59.041
I had my last personal time.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.487
I had my last quiet time.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.120
And I could see as I was coming in
for a landing

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:08.370
that there was a group
that had gathered.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:13.606
And there was the prospect
of having to deal with the press.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.808
Well, I'm a BASE jumper.
And I'm a professional.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:25.131
And Carl wanted that no one
should miss a beat in their lives

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.080
if and when he died,
whenever that would have been.

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.282
And it didn't matter how.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.880
Everybody goes through
the same things in life.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.004
From the time they're born
to the time they die.

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.009
We all go through birth and death.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:43.921
But we have had cultural pressures
about how to handle it.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.646
What did you feel doing this jump today?

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:51.049
It was just like any other BASE jump.
It was the same.

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.607
Were you thinking of some special thing?

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:58.770
No. No. Nothing really special.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:02.248
So you didn't have your husband in mind?

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:07.207
Well, under canopy I thought of him.
But that's really kind of personal.

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:15.606
Everyone has his own real way
of reacting. It will be individual.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:21.409
And BASE jumping encourages people
to think as individuals,

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:25.241
to discover and explore
their individuality.

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:28.091
It is not unique to BASE jumping.

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:32.842
BASE jumping is just
a condensed version.

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:38.080
Somehow, in this earthly experience,

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:41.011
we have to depart.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.364
There has been no one who has not
departed from this earthly experience.

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:50.887
So don't let death impede you
as a hurdle.

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.362
Don't let it be a wall
that you bang up against

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.290
and then can't see past,
can't see through,

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.846
can't see over.

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:03.931
Climb the walls quickly as you can
and go on.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:10.369
We know everyone
doesn't want to do this

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.807
but if they see us do it,
they can be inspired

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:15.924
to go out and bowl a perfect 300 game
or mow the lawn.

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:19.169
It doesn't matter what.
They're encouraged by what we can do.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:22.767
I think it makes, you know,
a better quality life for us

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.962
to know that we can do this.

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.128
You always wondered with Carl

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.402
that underneath, what's the real story?

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:37.331
What are those core beliefs
that would drive you to do that?

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.920
I got to think
it's that sort of mystical thing

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.646
where he thought that he could...
That mind-over-matter thing.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.087
He was the one person
that could get away with it.

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.488
But the Troll Wall had other ideas.

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.804
JEAN: What deserves the praise?

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.321
Death doesn't deserve praise.

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:21.322
Life and the wondrous works that
we do in life from our good ideas,

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.245
those deserve the praise.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.681
That's what we should be standing by.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.287
That's what we should be
paying attention to.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.131
And that's what Carl was all about.

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.760
Carl would love to have the new wing
suit flyers standing on his shoulders

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.962
and jumping v"-

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:53.928
They have taken from what
he was trying to inspire in people

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:57.607
about breaking through
artificial limitations

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:03.847
and going beyond what people say
can or cannot be done.

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:12.044
He would be right there
with the wing suit flyers.

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.208
And, in essence, is.

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.484

<i>No books to read</i>
