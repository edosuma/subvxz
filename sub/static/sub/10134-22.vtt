08:49.112 --> 08:51.239
For the first couple of months.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.870
I don't like this one bit.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.249
Well, maybe I can help

08:58.788 --> 09:01.249
you with this, Michelle.

09:01.291 --> 09:05.003
We better go right now.

09:01.291 --> 09:05.003
This is serious.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.547
Okay, okay.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.217
- Jess.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.217
- Rebecca.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.885
- Jess.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.885
- We're nuts.

09:11.926 --> 09:12.927
[moaning]

09:12.969 --> 09:14.929
[knocking on door]

09:14.971 --> 09:16.681
It's the kid again.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.517
Alright, kill the music.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.935
This time I'm getting tough.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.856
We're sleeping, honey.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.526
(Joey)

09:24.898 --> 09:27.526
'Then why are you

09:24.898 --> 09:27.526
talking, angel?'

09:29.110 --> 09:30.862
It's the big kid.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.659
Jess, Michelle

09:34.408 --> 09:36.659
has a big problem.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.247
Yes, Michelle.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.247
What's your problem?

09:40.288 --> 09:43.500
You tell him, Joey! I'm too mad!

09:44.834 --> 09:46.044
Well, Michelle

09:44.834 --> 09:46.044
thinks you don't have

09:46.086 --> 09:48.296
time to spend

09:46.086 --> 09:48.296
with her anymore.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.424
I'm madder than that!

09:51.299 --> 09:52.759
I'm sorry.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.886
Have you no decency?

09:56.679 --> 09:58.848
All this sweet little girl

09:56.679 --> 09:58.848
wants to do is spend some time

09:58.890 --> 10:00.767
with her aunt and uncle

09:58.890 --> 10:00.767
who she loves.

10:00.808 --> 10:04.145
Is that too much to ask?

10:00.808 --> 10:04.145
I think not.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.982
Much better.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.322
Michelle, now,

10:11.611 --> 10:14.322
your Aunt Becky and I

10:14.364 --> 10:16.324
love you very, very, very much.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.076
And we're sorry if

10:16.366 --> 10:18.076
we hurt your feelings

10:18.118 --> 10:20.995
but we need to spend

10:18.118 --> 10:20.995
some time alone.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.624
Michelle, I have an idea.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.835
How about if the three of us

10:24.665 --> 10:27.835
set aside some special time

10:27.877 --> 10:30.255
every day for you to

10:27.877 --> 10:30.255
come up here and play?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.340
I'd like that.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.842
Alright, it's a deal.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.471
Okay, Joey, let's go play.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.432
Oh, I can't, uh, Michelle,

10:37.512 --> 10:40.432
I have to do my taxes.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.017
Have you no decency?

10:43.059 --> 10:45.604
All this young lady wants to do

10:43.059 --> 10:45.604
is hang out with her pal Joey

10:45.645 --> 10:48.565
who she loves very much.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.565
Is that too much to ask?

10:48.607 --> 10:50.400
I think not.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.948
Steph, honey, I know you

10:54.946 --> 10:56.948
like hanging out with your dad

10:56.990 --> 10:58.992
but do you really wanna

10:56.990 --> 10:58.992
try out for little league?

10:59.033 --> 11:01.035
Dad, I've done some

10:59.033 --> 11:01.035
serious thinking

11:01.077 --> 11:04.122
and I've decided that

11:01.077 --> 11:04.122
baseball is my life.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.083
You just like baseball

11:07.125 --> 11:08.793
'cause Brett likes baseball.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.004
I bet you can't even throw.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.632
I can too.

11:13.672 --> 11:15.842
Ow! Whoa!

11:15.883 --> 11:18.219
This babe's got an arm.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.930
Hey, my daughter is not a babe.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.224
She does have an arm.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.224
Steph, let's try something here.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.352
Rusty, come here.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.352
Give me the ball, son.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.603
And grab yourself a bat.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.188
And I want you

11:26.645 --> 11:28.188
to stand in there.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.482
Steph, I want you to

11:28.229 --> 11:30.482
wind up really hard

11:30.524 --> 11:32.567
and pitch one into me right now.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.653
Okay? Right in here.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.074
Whoa! Did you see

11:37.905 --> 11:40.074
that ball curve?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.661
I sure did.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.746
Steph, how would you like

11:42.701 --> 11:45.746
to pitch for the Giants?

11:45.788 --> 11:47.874
Great. Thanks, dad.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.084
Now, what are we gonna

11:47.915 --> 11:50.084
call that pitch of yours?

11:50.126 --> 11:51.919
The Tanner Twister.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.214
This Saturday we're

11:51.961 --> 11:54.214
gonna kill the Cubs.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.299
Yeah, we're gonna destroy 'em.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.218
We're gonna cream 'em.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.096
We are going to make

11:58.259 --> 12:02.096
the Cubs eat dust!

12:02.138 --> 12:04.224
I love being a jock.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.310
Let's go.

12:07.352 --> 12:10.438
[instrumental music]

12:12.148 --> 12:14.942
Come on down, everybody.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.942
Breakfast is ready.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.444
Michelle is so

12:14.984 --> 12:16.444
excited, I told her

12:16.486 --> 12:18.988
she could be Batboy

12:16.486 --> 12:18.988
at the game today.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.040
Daddy, I'm here.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.126
Michelle, you're

12:30.500 --> 12:32.126
not fighting crime.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.837
You're handing

12:32.168 --> 12:34.837
out baseball bats.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.839
Aw, nuts.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.966
Can I still wear the cape?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.886
Sure, sweetheart.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.681
Stephanie, guess

12:41.928 --> 12:44.681
who's here to see you.

12:44.723 --> 12:45.806
Who?

12:45.848 --> 12:48.767
Brett-Brett,

12:45.848 --> 12:48.767
Brett-Brett Brett-Brett.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.896
D.J., puh-lease.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.653
Doesn't he look

12:55.816 --> 12:58.653
great in that uniform?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.280
Yes, but, don't

12:58.695 --> 13:00.280
let him know that.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.490
- Be cool.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.490
- Got it.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.993
Hi, Steph.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.161
Hello.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.665
You look great

13:08.455 --> 13:10.665
in that uniform.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.335
Beginners.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.754
You know, it's

13:14.377 --> 13:15.754
too bad our teams

13:15.794 --> 13:17.672
are playing each

13:15.794 --> 13:17.672
other opening day.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.550
Yeah, I hope you win.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.343
I hope we win too.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.928
I hope it's a tie.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.055
Wanna see what I

13:23.970 --> 13:26.055
wrote on my bat?

13:27.390 --> 13:29.392
"S.T." with

13:27.390 --> 13:29.392
a heart around it?

13:29.434 --> 13:32.145
S.T. for

13:29.434 --> 13:32.145
Stephanie Tanner.

13:32.186 --> 13:36.023
Oh, Brett, does this mean

13:32.186 --> 13:36.023
what I think it means?

13:36.065 --> 13:37.776
I hope it means

13:36.065 --> 13:37.776
you're my girlfriend.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.110
Alright!

13:41.362 --> 13:42.739
I mean..

13:42.781 --> 13:44.991
...that's cool.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.535
- Well, good luck today.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.535
- Good luck to you too.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.121
Hmm, thanks.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.121
I'll need it.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.582
I heard nobody can hit

13:50.163 --> 13:52.582
the Tanner Twister.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.293
Yeah, I even struck out my dad.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.920
Oh, no. My whole

13:55.335 --> 13:57.920
family's gonna be there.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.714
If I get struck out

13:57.962 --> 13:59.714
by my own girlfriend

13:59.756 --> 14:01.466
I'll never hear the end of it.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.384
You probably won't strike out.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.927
I hope not.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.140
I hate to even say this,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.140
but if you threw me

14:09.182 --> 14:11.768
a couple of easy ones,

14:09.182 --> 14:11.768
I'd be sure to get a hit.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.604
- Isn't that cheating?

14:11.810 --> 14:14.604
- Kind of.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.315
Or it could just be a girlfriend

14:14.646 --> 14:17.315
helping a boyfriend.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.693
Well, you could

14:17.357 --> 14:19.693
look at it that way.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.235
Great! Thanks for

14:19.734 --> 14:21.235
helping me, Steph.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.862
I'll see you at the game.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.203
So, Steph, what did Brett want?

14:30.244 --> 14:33.289
Oh, he just came by

14:30.244 --> 14:33.289
to wish me good luck.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.834
Come on, honey, let's eat.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.834
Star pitchers need their energy.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.627
Dad, what would happen today

14:37.669 --> 14:40.129
if, say, I didn't

14:37.669 --> 14:40.129
pitch too well?

14:40.171 --> 14:43.675
Like if I gave up a couple

14:40.171 --> 14:43.675
of home runs or something?

14:45.259 --> 14:47.804
Steph..

14:47.846 --> 14:50.264
...I don't want you to put

14:47.846 --> 14:50.264
any pressure on yourself.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.059
All that matters is that

14:50.306 --> 14:53.059
with every pitch you throw

14:53.100 --> 14:55.019
you're doing

14:53.100 --> 14:55.019
the best you can.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.979
- Okay?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.979
- Okay.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.231
Okay.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.902

'Okay, Steph! Strike him out!'

15:12.495 --> 15:13.663
- 'Go get 'em!'

- Strike!

15:13.705 --> 15:16.290
[spectators cheering]

15:17.458 --> 15:18.793
Come on, Steph.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.588
Hey, batter, batter, strike out.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.924
(D.J.)

15:23.047 --> 15:24.924
'Get him, Stephie!'

15:26.926 --> 15:29.136
Strike three!

15:30.388 --> 15:33.349
Thank you very much.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.518
The Tanner Twister

15:33.391 --> 15:35.518
strikes again.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.520
That brings up

15:35.560 --> 15:37.520
dangerous Brett Davis.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.397
'Davis hit a double

15:37.562 --> 15:39.397
his first time up.'

15:39.439 --> 15:41.482
'Come on Brett!

15:39.439 --> 15:41.482
Come on, you can do it!'

15:43.276 --> 15:46.028
Come on, Steph.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.028
Fire it in there.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.072
Burn it by him.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.866
Blow that smoke!

15:49.908 --> 15:52.452
Just throw the ball,

15:49.908 --> 15:52.452
honey, I'm out of<i> cliches.</i>

15:52.493 --> 15:55.079
Come on, Brett!

15:52.493 --> 15:55.079
Don't let me down!

15:55.121 --> 15:56.997
(D.J.)

15:55.121 --> 15:56.997
Get him, Steph!'

16:00.710 --> 16:04.589
It's a shot to left.

16:00.710 --> 16:04.589
It's going. It's going.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.342
'It's gone. Home run!

16:10.052 --> 16:12.806
- Way to go!

- 'Way to go, Brett!'

- 'Yay!'

'Don't worry, Steph.

Take the blue one,

16:37.538 --> 16:39.749
it's prettier.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.126
Thank you, Batgirl.

Huh, huh, huh?

17:17.578 --> 17:20.498
- Jess, don't make a scene.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.498
- Danny, do something.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.583
That's the worst call

17:20.540 --> 17:22.583
I've ever seen in my life.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.418
Jess, I was standing

17:22.625 --> 17:24.418
right there. She was out.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.753
Oh. Well, why don't

17:24.460 --> 17:25.753

17:25.795 --> 17:27.839
I can't see a thing

17:25.795 --> 17:27.839
from where we're at.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.049
Come on, honey, be a good

17:30.090 --> 17:31.467

- Not really.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.673
I need to talk to D.J.

Here comes D.J. Tanner.

- Joey.

- 'Sorry.'

Deej, tell her to

19:11.609 --> 19:14.320
throw the twister, okay?

19:14.361 --> 19:15.613
Okay.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.117
What is it?

19:17.197 --> 19:19.117
This is embarrassing.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.493
I'm in trouble.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.328
Brett wants me to

19:20.534 --> 19:22.328
throw him an easy one

19:22.369 --> 19:23.955
so he can get a hit.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.123
Oh, I get it.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.165
If you strike him out

19:26.206 --> 19:27.416
you might lose

19:26.206 --> 19:27.416
a boyfriend.

19:27.458 --> 19:28.835
But if you let

19:27.458 --> 19:28.835
him get a hit

19:28.876 --> 19:30.962
you'll be letting

19:28.876 --> 19:30.962
your whole team down.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.297
Tough one.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.297
Well, good luck.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.634
D.J., wait.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.634
What do I do?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.928
Well, you have to decide

19:36.676 --> 19:38.928
what's more important.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.847
Self-respect or true love.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.728
This would be a lot easier

19:44.558 --> 19:47.728
if he wasn't such a babe.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.776
Play ball!

19:53.818 --> 19:56.863
Alright, folks. We're finally

19:53.818 --> 19:56.863
ready for the moment of truth.

One more strike

19:56.904 --> 19:58.990
and the Giants win.

19:59.032 --> 20:02.576
But if Brett gets a hit,

19:59.032 --> 20:02.576
the Cubs could win.

Hey, nachos, over here.
