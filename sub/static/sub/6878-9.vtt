28:15.653 --> 28:19.072
I mean, not to pretend.

28:15.653 --> 28:19.072
But to...

28:19.114 --> 28:20.991
To feel.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.330
Oh.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.915
Sorry.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.168
God, I'm sorry, Phoebe.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.127
I think I gave you

28:31.210 --> 28:32.127
the wrong impression.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.255
I'm not interested

28:32.169 --> 28:35.255
in you that way.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.049
Oh.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.634
I'm really sorry.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.634
I--I--

28:38.676 --> 28:40.219
I--I appreciate

28:38.676 --> 28:40.219
what you're trying to do.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.638
No, I'm--I'm sorry to assume.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.638
Um...

28:47.767 --> 28:49.436
Could I have some water?

28:51.605 --> 28:54.024
She wants me fired.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.151
Out of the building,

28:54.066 --> 28:56.151
never to be heard from again.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.653
That bitch.

28:57.695 --> 28:58.529
I mean, yeah.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.780
I'm sleeping with her husband.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.200
But it's Albert.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.200
He's like...

29:03.242 --> 29:05.661
- He's like my--

29:03.242 --> 29:05.661
- Gymnastics coach?

29:05.703 --> 29:08.330
What?

29:05.703 --> 29:08.330
No.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.374
He's like my work husband.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.333
I have a work boyfriend.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.419
He plays my boyfriend

29:11.375 --> 29:13.419
on the show.

29:13.460 --> 29:14.336
And I'm sleeping with him.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.171
Yeah.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.171
I need to keep this job.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.049
My whole life is over if...

29:19.091 --> 29:21.093
Oh, God.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.637
This woman is gonna destroy me.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.264
- Why?

29:23.679 --> 29:25.264
- Hey.

29:25.305 --> 29:29.435
Shh, she does not

29:25.305 --> 29:29.435
want you fired.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.644
What makes you say that?

29:30.686 --> 29:33.397
Because it's what

29:30.686 --> 29:33.397
she asked for.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.231
I played a lawyer once.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.774
- You?

29:34.273 --> 29:35.774
- I wore glasses.

29:35.815 --> 29:40.279
And this person was saying that

29:35.815 --> 29:40.279
they wanted, like, $100,000,

29:40.320 --> 29:42.948
but really, they just wanted

29:40.320 --> 29:42.948
their mother's love.

29:42.989 --> 29:47.494
A lot of characters

29:42.989 --> 29:47.494
just want love.

29:51.373 --> 29:52.999
Huh.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.845
I'd really like to pose

30:02.842 --> 30:05.845
for you.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.145
Um...

30:13.186 --> 30:15.731
Okay.

30:15.773 --> 30:17.733
Here's your water.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.369
I was lying.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.369
You're all I think about.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.288
I can't eat.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.288
I can't sleep.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.915
You have no idea how hard it was

30:31.330 --> 30:33.915
for me to get that yogurt down.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.668
I thought I was going to

30:33.957 --> 30:35.668
choke on the cookie pieces.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.877
- I want you so bad.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.877
- Shh...

30:37.919 --> 30:39.463
I just don't want

30:37.919 --> 30:39.463
to disappoint you.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.214
You won't, no matter what.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.342
But you have to promise me

30:41.256 --> 30:43.342
that I'm not pushing you

30:43.383 --> 30:45.511
into something that you don't--

30:43.383 --> 30:45.511
you aren't ready for.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.886
That's not what's happening.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.930
I am beyond ready.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.642
I just might need

30:48.972 --> 30:51.642
a little bit of help.

30:51.684 --> 30:55.562
Okay, so let's just...

30:51.684 --> 30:55.562
let's explore.

30:55.604 --> 30:59.608
Look, porn is great

30:55.604 --> 30:59.608
for some things,

30:59.650 --> 31:03.153
but it's not real.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.738
It's super intimidating.

31:04.780 --> 31:08.200
And half the things they show,

31:04.780 --> 31:08.200
women don't even like anyways.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.785
Like what?

31:09.827 --> 31:12.329
I don't know who came up with

31:09.827 --> 31:12.329
coming all over a woman's face.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.914
But not fun.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.914
Not for me anyways.

31:14.956 --> 31:17.543
It's really annoying.

31:17.584 --> 31:18.502
Huh.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.505
But it feels

31:18.544 --> 31:21.505
really, really good

31:21.547 --> 31:24.299
when two people are in it

31:24.341 --> 31:29.054
and they are connected

31:24.341 --> 31:29.054
and the warmth just...

31:29.095 --> 31:32.766
- Feels warm?

31:29.095 --> 31:32.766
- It feels amazing.

31:32.808 --> 31:37.020
Sometimes, that's what...

31:32.808 --> 31:37.020
sends me over the edge.

31:39.272 --> 31:42.568
I want to take you

31:39.272 --> 31:42.568
over the edge.

31:42.609 --> 31:45.028
Then do it.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.364
Okay, why...me?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.364
Why--

31:47.406 --> 31:48.365
Stop!

31:48.407 --> 31:52.494
I don't know, JD.

31:48.407 --> 31:52.494
I don't know.

31:52.536 --> 31:57.374
I just know how I feel.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.042
Me too.

32:01.169 --> 32:06.007
I'm gonna kiss you now.

32:06.049 --> 32:10.220
♪ And I've emptied out

32:06.049 --> 32:10.220
my cards too ♪

32:10.262 --> 32:13.432

32:50.093 --> 32:51.428
Jo.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.221
Still got that beer

32:51.470 --> 32:53.221
you promised me?

32:53.263 --> 32:57.058
Yeah, 'course.

32:53.263 --> 32:57.058
Come in.

32:59.853 --> 33:04.691
So this is how tuna fish feel.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.318
Minus the mercury.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.069
So did you make the tournament?

33:08.111 --> 33:09.321
Yeah, yeah, I did.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.030
And?

33:11.072 --> 33:11.990
She won.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.784
Nice!

33:12.031 --> 33:13.784
Good for her!

33:13.826 --> 33:15.285
Yeah.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.458
- Have a seat.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.458
- Thank you.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.751
God, I would have loved

33:22.793 --> 33:24.169
to have seen Charlene's face

33:22.793 --> 33:24.169
when you turned up.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.796
I bet she was furious.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.422
She was actually okay.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.716
Come on, she's a super villain

33:27.464 --> 33:29.716
with pageant hair.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.427
She cares about my kid.

33:32.469 --> 33:34.262
Why are you spoiling this

33:32.469 --> 33:34.262
for me?

33:34.304 --> 33:36.055
I mean, Charlene,

33:34.304 --> 33:36.055
she might...

33:36.097 --> 33:41.353
have problems

33:36.097 --> 33:41.353
and everything, but...

33:41.394 --> 33:43.939
I'm the one

33:41.394 --> 33:43.939
my kid's embarrassed of.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.612
She didn't even

33:47.025 --> 33:50.612
want me there today.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.948
Well, one day,

33:52.990 --> 33:54.992
she'll remember

33:52.990 --> 33:54.992
that you were there

33:55.033 --> 33:56.743
and it will matter.

33:56.785 --> 33:59.120
Why are you second guessing

33:56.785 --> 33:59.120
your instincts, Jo?

33:59.162 --> 34:02.081
I came in there

33:59.162 --> 34:02.081
like a Mac truck today.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.167
And Zooey,

34:02.123 --> 34:04.167
she just tolerated me.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.670
She tolerated me.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.259
Jo.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.136
What's going on?

34:18.390 --> 34:22.978
I did something really stupid.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.063
Um...

34:25.104 --> 34:27.482
I let somebody hurt me.

34:27.524 --> 34:31.028
It was one of the creeps

34:27.524 --> 34:31.028
I went out with.

34:31.069 --> 34:36.909
And...this psycho

34:31.069 --> 34:36.909
could have killed me.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.065
[giggles]

35:08.106 --> 35:09.900
Wow...

35:08.106 --> 35:09.900
[laughs]

35:09.942 --> 35:13.152
- Mm-hmm.

35:09.942 --> 35:13.152
- Okay.

35:13.194 --> 35:14.988
Did I...I know

35:13.194 --> 35:14.988
I should ask this but--

35:15.030 --> 35:16.656
You were right

35:15.030 --> 35:16.656
on the money, babe.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.492
I thought so.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.120
Sorry about the part

35:19.534 --> 35:22.120
where I cried.

35:22.161 --> 35:24.081
That was beautiful.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.540
I don't know.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.208
There's no crying in porn.

35:27.250 --> 35:31.170
Oh, I'm pretty sure

35:27.250 --> 35:31.170
everybody cries in porn.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.631
Believe me,

35:32.672 --> 35:35.174
you have nothing to worry about.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.096
Thank you.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.515
You can leave now.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.393
Do you want me to go?

35:45.435 --> 35:48.105
Oh, I just don't want to

35:45.435 --> 35:48.105
take up any more of your time.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.898
Oh.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.316
Oh, I thought we'd go again,

35:51.357 --> 35:52.400
but, yeah, that's probably

35:51.357 --> 35:52.400
a good idea, I'll just go--

35:52.442 --> 35:55.153
Yes, please!

35:59.365 --> 36:01.827
Okay, my Uber is here, so...

36:01.868 --> 36:03.244
I'll walk you down.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.372
Oh, no, that's okay.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.372
Thank you.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.668
That was exactly the kind of...

36:09.709 --> 36:11.628
everything I needed.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.172
A little fun with non-monogamy.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.174
It's what we both needed.

36:16.215 --> 36:18.217
I'm glad you called.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.386
Me too.

36:25.350 --> 36:28.520
Are you sure

36:25.350 --> 36:28.520
you've got to grab that Uber?

36:28.561 --> 36:30.147
Let me know when you're--

36:30.188 --> 36:31.648
If you come back into town.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.441
- I am coming back actually.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.441
- Yeah?

36:33.483 --> 36:35.027
- In a couple weeks.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.027
- Oh.

36:35.068 --> 36:36.277
If everything

36:35.068 --> 36:36.277
goes the way I hope,

36:36.319 --> 36:37.278
I may be getting a place here.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.615
Really?

36:37.320 --> 36:40.615
Because of your client?

36:40.657 --> 36:42.659
I was actually thinking about

36:40.657 --> 36:42.659
getting back into acting.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.203
I had a meeting with

36:42.701 --> 36:45.203
some agents this week.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.956
And I hope you don't mind,

36:45.244 --> 36:47.956
but I used your name at WME.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.166
Uh--

36:49.207 --> 36:51.501
I knew they repped you

36:49.207 --> 36:51.501
and it got me a meeting.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.337
So I'll let you know

36:51.543 --> 36:54.337
how everything turns out.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.341
Okay.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.468
Um...that's great.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.345
- So.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.345
- Whoa, hey, hey.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.263
Hey, get back here.

37:04.305 --> 37:07.392
Okay.

37:07.433 --> 37:08.643
Good night, Abby.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.478
Good night.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.442
Your pelvis goes forward.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.819
Your back is straight,

37:57.483 --> 37:59.819
chest up,

37:59.861 --> 38:00.862
shoulders back.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.322
And then it's just up down,

38:00.904 --> 38:03.322
up down.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.242
Okay.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.242
Hold on a second.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.410
Okay.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.410
So it's like this?

38:07.452 --> 38:10.329
- Uh-huh.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.329
- And then?

38:10.371 --> 38:11.164
Up, down.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.164
[laughs]

38:11.206 --> 38:13.959
- This is posting?

38:11.206 --> 38:13.959
- Yeah.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.919
It's also called banging your

38:14.000 --> 38:15.919
balls on the back of a horse.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.378
I don't have any balls.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.965
Well, not you, but--

38:17.420 --> 38:19.965
[laughs]

38:20.006 --> 38:22.675
- I definitely don't.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.675
- No, you don't.

38:22.717 --> 38:26.096
[laughter]

38:26.138 --> 38:27.513
You are, like,

38:26.138 --> 38:27.513
a totally different person

38:27.555 --> 38:29.682
then when I first met you.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.768
Well, a lot has

38:29.724 --> 38:31.768
happened since then.

38:31.810 --> 38:32.811
Mm-hmm.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.188
I mean,

38:32.852 --> 38:35.188
it was really good yogurt.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.274
- It is.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.274
- You're amazing.

38:37.356 --> 38:39.109
That's what's different.

38:39.151 --> 38:40.860
You're amazing.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.404
- No, you are.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.404
- You are.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.407
You are.

38:46.449 --> 38:49.119
- You are.

38:46.449 --> 38:49.119
- All right.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.873
It's 7:00 a.m.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.918
What are you doing summoning

38:53.915 --> 38:56.918
me here at this ungodly hour?

38:56.960 --> 38:59.045
I'm not waiting

38:56.960 --> 38:59.045
for you to handle things.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.506
- You don't have a choice.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.506
- I think I do.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.220
Sherry.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.972
You have ten minutes.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.474
Then let me be direct.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.310
I owe you an apology.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.769
What I did was wrong.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.563
I wasn't thinking about

39:14.811 --> 39:17.563
the damage I was doing to you

39:17.605 --> 39:19.816
or your marriage,

39:17.605 --> 39:19.816
and I'm sorry.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.109
I want you to know

39:21.151 --> 39:23.361
there was never anything

39:21.151 --> 39:23.361
substantial between us.

39:23.402 --> 39:27.365
It was a mistake.

39:27.406 --> 39:31.536
And it'll never happen again.

39:31.577 --> 39:34.413
Thank you.

39:31.577 --> 39:34.413
Can I go now?

39:34.455 --> 39:36.249
Not until you tell me:

39:36.291 --> 39:37.542
what do you really want?

39:37.583 --> 39:39.252
I want this

39:37.583 --> 39:39.252
to have never happened.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.046
You know

39:39.294 --> 39:41.046
I can't give you that.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.298
[sighs]

39:47.344 --> 39:49.512
I want the Malibu house

39:47.344 --> 39:49.512
titled to me

39:49.554 --> 39:51.681
as well as the London flat.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.267
I want the suite

39:51.723 --> 39:54.267
at Dodger Stadium,

39:54.309 --> 39:56.477
and I want the courtside

39:54.309 --> 39:56.477
Laker season tickets.

39:56.519 --> 39:57.520
- Hold on.

39:56.519 --> 39:57.520
- Seems fair.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.022
Is that it?

39:59.064 --> 40:00.481
What is this,

39:59.064 --> 40:00.481
a divorce negotiation?

40:00.523 --> 40:01.858
Are you leaving me?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.610
Not yet.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.821
That's it.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.821
For now.

40:06.863 --> 40:11.409
I think this firm

40:06.863 --> 40:11.409
still has some growth potential.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.912
Sherry.

40:32.138 --> 40:35.474
- Hey.

40:35.516 --> 40:36.976
Sorry.

40:37.018 --> 40:40.813
I came in to get some milk and

40:37.018 --> 40:40.813
it just felt so nice in here.

40:42.565 --> 40:45.777
You all right?

40:45.818 --> 40:49.072
I think

40:45.818 --> 40:49.072
I'm gonna quit acting.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.574
I don't feel

40:49.114 --> 40:51.574
much like an actress.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.076
You are in the manatee stage.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.036
No major decisions.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.579
It's all so stupid,

40:56.621 --> 40:59.916
pretending to be

40:56.621 --> 40:59.916
a superhero vampire

40:59.958 --> 41:02.335
who's in love with a demon king.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.670
People are crazy

41:02.377 --> 41:04.670
about your show.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.339
Abby,

41:04.712 --> 41:06.339
I couldn't talk to anyone

41:06.381 --> 41:08.341
at the party last night.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.635
It's like they were speaking

41:08.383 --> 41:10.635
a foreign language.

41:10.676 --> 41:13.388
"So-and-so's hooking up

41:10.676 --> 41:13.388
with so-and-so"

41:13.430 --> 41:15.223
and "What's-her-name

41:13.430 --> 41:15.223
left the show."

41:15.265 --> 41:17.558
And I just didn't care.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.726
It's okay.

41:18.768 --> 41:22.021
But I want to care.

41:22.063 --> 41:24.232
Those people are my friends,

41:22.063 --> 41:24.232
you know...

41:24.274 --> 41:27.652
What if we don't

41:24.274 --> 41:27.652
get each other anymore?

41:27.693 --> 41:29.779
I'll lose them.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.572
Maybe.

41:35.201 --> 41:40.039
But you can't force yourself

41:35.201 --> 41:40.039
to be somewhere you're not.

41:40.081 --> 41:45.462
I mean, I have been doing my

41:40.081 --> 41:45.462
damnedest with Harris, but...

41:45.503 --> 41:50.508
So, what?

41:45.503 --> 41:50.508
It's just over?

41:50.549 --> 41:53.678
No, it's not over.

41:50.549 --> 41:53.678
It's just different, maybe.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.722
Changing.

41:56.764 --> 42:01.102
What is?

42:01.144 --> 42:03.646
