WEBVTT

00:08.557 --> 00:10.070
Nothing.

00:12.107 --> 00:14.728
Good start.

00:16.212 --> 00:17.732
Ooh.

00:20.550 --> 00:21.845
Thank you.

00:22.764 --> 00:23.784
Hmm?

00:23.785 --> 00:25.696
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.747
- Mmm.
- Good?

00:30.223 --> 00:32.700
- Emma?
- Daniel?

00:32.768 --> 00:34.720
Can I just say...

00:35.615 --> 00:37.719
you look fat and your dress is terrible.

00:38.737 --> 00:40.186
- So, you look great.
- Thank you.

00:40.206 --> 00:43.154
- I got you something.
- Oh, thank you.

00:46.018 --> 00:48.878
- A... necklace?
- A locket.

00:48.898 --> 00:50.202
Look inside.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.981
- It's you.
- Yeah.

00:55.982 --> 00:57.689
Okay, two things.

00:57.709 --> 01:03.249
Thank you, um, and I don't want it.

01:03.269 --> 01:04.982
Because it's a necklace? Grow up.

01:04.983 --> 01:06.485
- No.
- Men can wear necklaces.

01:06.505 --> 01:08.314
Yeah, but not with a photo of their
best friend in a love heart.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.491
- What's Josh gonna think?
- He has my real heart.

01:10.511 --> 01:12.146
Eww.

01:12.166 --> 01:14.002
- Listen, you're going overseas.
- Tasmania.

01:14.003 --> 01:16.618
- Your mum's dying.
- Having a minor back operation.

01:16.638 --> 01:18.565
You're gonna run her business
and you're terrible at business.

01:18.585 --> 01:21.560
Am I? Because she's asked for my help
and she's never done that before

01:21.561 --> 01:24.540
so she must think I've
got some skills, hm.

01:24.541 --> 01:25.977
I just don't think
you've prepared yourself

01:25.997 --> 01:27.596
- for how this is gonna affect you.
- What?

01:27.597 --> 01:28.613
Missing me.

01:28.614 --> 01:31.043
I'm not gonna miss someone
spewing in my dishwasher.

01:31.063 --> 01:32.581
Well, you shouldn't have left it open.

01:32.582 --> 01:34.213
You're right. I was...
I was asking for it.

01:34.233 --> 01:36.548
- You're acting really ungrateful.
- Sorry.

01:36.549 --> 01:39.568
- It was just a little weird, is all.
- You know what? Give it back.

01:39.569 --> 01:41.564
- No, give it back. You don't want it.
- No, no, no, no.

01:41.565 --> 01:43.564
- You obviously don't want it.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:43.565 --> 01:44.882
I'm being silly. It is the best.

01:44.902 --> 01:47.052
- Thank you.
- So are you gonna wear it?

01:47.072 --> 01:48.250
Yeah.

01:52.315 --> 01:55.029
- You put on a locket.
- Okay.

01:55.049 --> 01:57.556
I'm getting married, I'm not
going to war, you idiot.

01:57.557 --> 01:59.529
I thought there was a trap.

01:59.605 --> 02:00.805
We gotta go.

02:02.589 --> 02:03.936
Okay.

02:04.288 --> 02:06.529
I just need your help
with something first.

02:09.365 --> 02:11.528
This is nice.

02:11.733 --> 02:13.576
Are you peeing?

02:13.577 --> 02:15.290
I think so.

02:15.310 --> 02:17.269
You're being a really great bridesmaid.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.342
Do I have to do this at
the wedding, as well?

02:18.343 --> 02:20.345
- If you want to.
- No.

02:20.871 --> 02:22.294
Okay, I'm finished.

02:23.306 --> 02:25.349
Well, what do we do now?

02:25.917 --> 02:27.330
I dunno.

Remember, you're not
just in charge of a business,

03:45.302 --> 03:47.289
you're in charge of you.

03:47.290 --> 03:50.310
The past is a picture. Now is a mirror.

03:51.310 --> 03:54.313
The future is a blank canvas.

03:54.314 --> 03:57.652
You could draw a lion,
that's you as a lion.

04:33.918 --> 04:35.760
Danny McCallum?

04:35.780 --> 04:37.470
It's Daniel.

04:39.318 --> 04:42.726
- Thought it was you. Welcome back.
- Sergeant Hardwick?

04:42.746 --> 04:45.959
Yeah. Oh, Greg, please.
You're an adult now.

04:45.979 --> 04:48.044
Remember I used to do
talks at your school?

04:48.064 --> 04:49.900
Uhh... yeah, bullying.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.594
Stop bringing it on yourself.

04:51.614 --> 04:52.622
Very powerful.

04:52.642 --> 04:54.893
Never seemed to work
with you, though, Danny.

04:54.913 --> 04:57.301
Kids loved to bully ya.
Especially my son.

04:57.302 --> 04:58.310
Sorry about Bruce.

04:58.311 --> 05:00.293
It's probably just... just the red hair.

05:00.294 --> 05:02.321
No, I don't think so.

05:02.322 --> 05:05.313
So, what happened? You couldn't
hack it on the mainland?

05:05.314 --> 05:07.037
Uh, well, actually, I've come to, uh,

05:07.057 --> 05:09.317
fill in for my mum
at the real estate agency.

05:09.318 --> 05:10.865
- Barbara?
- Yeah.

05:10.885 --> 05:12.779
Ohh. Big shoes to fill.

05:12.799 --> 05:15.801
I used to try my mum's shoes
as a kid, so...

05:15.821 --> 05:17.997
Ah, you wear your mother's shoes?

05:19.683 --> 05:21.128
Not anymore.

05:22.286 --> 05:23.286
Anyway, good to see you.

05:23.287 --> 05:25.699
Yeah, yeah, look, uh, I'll let ya
go. We'll grab a beer sometime.

05:25.719 --> 05:27.746
Definitely, definitely. See ya later.

05:40.294 --> 05:41.342
Sorry, did you want to
get the beer now or...?

05:41.343 --> 05:43.313
Uh, no, no. I...

05:43.314 --> 05:45.069
forgot to give you your ticket.

05:45.089 --> 05:46.321
You were speeding back there.

05:46.322 --> 05:47.962
I'll see ya later.

05:51.928 --> 05:53.763
_

07:04.424 --> 07:05.455
Hello.

07:05.456 --> 07:08.458
Hi, uh, Mrs Marsh.
It's... it's me. Daniel.

07:08.459 --> 07:11.462
I know. I used to babysit you.

07:11.463 --> 07:14.418
Yeah, I know. It's...
it's been, like, 10 years.

07:14.419 --> 07:16.446
I've been... How are you?

07:16.745 --> 07:18.753
Good. Good.

07:19.423 --> 07:21.291
You've had a haircut.

07:22.190 --> 07:23.619
Yeah, I've had heaps.

07:25.184 --> 07:27.211
Anyway, good to see you.

07:27.554 --> 07:29.479
Office looks... good.

07:34.595 --> 07:36.466
Is Mum around?

07:36.467 --> 07:37.467
Nope.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.494
Oh, do you mind if I get that?
I'm keen to get started.

07:45.439 --> 07:48.422
Thank you for choosing McCallum
Real Estate. This is Daniel.

07:48.423 --> 07:50.012
Uh, Daniel.

07:50.032 --> 07:51.827
Uh, Barbara's son.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.800
Uh, no, no. Barbara's not here.

07:53.820 --> 07:56.719
Um, is there anything I can do for you?

08:02.118 --> 08:03.076
Hey!

08:03.096 --> 08:04.458
- Hi.
- You took your time.

08:04.459 --> 08:06.462
Yeah, sorry. Uh, Terry. Daniel.

08:06.463 --> 08:07.475
Don't worry about that.

08:07.476 --> 08:09.474
- Open the bloody door!
- Yes. Of course.

08:17.102 --> 08:19.426
Oh, Jesus Christ.

08:19.427 --> 08:20.627
What?!

08:22.455 --> 08:23.963
What have you done?

08:23.983 --> 08:26.482
Hi. I'm sorry, uh... who are you?

08:26.483 --> 08:28.434
We live here.

08:28.435 --> 08:31.466
Right. Uh, I... I assumed
the place was empty.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.418
Terry reckons because he's the landlord

08:33.419 --> 08:36.626
he can just come in whenever
he wants and use the bathroom.

08:36.645 --> 08:37.566
I'm sorry, what?

08:37.586 --> 08:39.457
- I caught him having a shower once.
- Hm.

08:39.458 --> 08:40.467
I had to throw out my loofah.

08:40.467 --> 08:43.457
Yeah, we had his key taken away
and you bloody let him in again.

08:43.458 --> 08:44.928
How'd you get a key?

08:44.948 --> 08:47.454
Uh, no, sorry. I'm, uh...
I'm Barbara's son. I'm Daniel.

08:47.455 --> 08:49.474
I'm the new real estate agent.

08:49.475 --> 08:51.447
Whew. That was close.

08:52.447 --> 08:54.510
You can't keep doing this, Terry.

08:54.977 --> 08:56.105
It's my house.

08:56.125 --> 08:58.314
Yeah. You don't live here anymore.

08:58.334 --> 08:59.502
Well, tell him.

08:59.503 --> 09:02.036
Terry, don't you have your own toilet?

09:02.056 --> 09:04.774
On the other side of town
but, uh, I fish down the road.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.950
Where else am I supposed to go?

09:06.970 --> 09:08.233
The bushes?

09:08.253 --> 09:09.486
For number twos? Get real.

09:10.488 --> 09:13.426
Terry, on the lease agreement it
states you can't enter the property

09:13.427 --> 09:14.475
without giving the
tenants proper notice.

09:14.476 --> 09:15.974
- I'm the landlord.
- Yes...

09:15.994 --> 09:18.434
I let them stay here out of the...
goodness of my heart.

09:18.435 --> 09:19.470
Oh, we pay rent, Terry.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.919
I can't use my own toilet?

09:20.939 --> 09:22.462
- He pisses on the seat.
- It's my seat.

09:22.463 --> 09:24.418
I'm changing the bloody locks.

09:24.419 --> 09:25.782
- Uh, no, no, it's...
- I'll break a window.

09:25.802 --> 09:27.736
I don't care because they're my windows.

09:27.756 --> 09:29.762
- Okay, well...
- Smash a window and I'll smash you!

09:29.782 --> 09:30.669
Guys.

09:30.689 --> 09:32.478
- I feel another one coming on.
- No, Terry.

09:32.479 --> 09:35.639
- Don't even think about it.
- Babe. Babe!

09:37.471 --> 09:40.470
Uh...

09:40.471 --> 09:43.490
- Stop, Terry!
- Um, sorry, if you just...

09:43.491 --> 09:45.462
Terry! Get off him!

09:45.463 --> 09:48.450
Hello? Uh... guys...
if you could just...

09:48.451 --> 09:50.499
- Terry!
- Listen for one second. Uh...

09:52.483 --> 09:54.997
All of ya, shut up!

09:58.443 --> 09:59.643
Hi, Mum.

10:03.315 --> 10:04.490
Um...

10:04.491 --> 10:06.462
Thanks for your help in there.

10:06.463 --> 10:08.466
You're not even supposed to be
in the office until tomorrow.

10:08.467 --> 10:10.450
Well, I was just trying to let
someone into their house.

10:10.451 --> 10:11.467
How was I supposed to know he's...?

10:11.468 --> 10:13.510
You shouldn't have gone off without me.

10:14.011 --> 10:15.446
Is your back okay?

10:15.447 --> 10:16.507
Fine.

10:16.851 --> 10:18.736
- Ya eaten?
- Uh, no.

10:18.756 --> 10:21.805
- Just head home.
- I'll see ya there tonight.

10:31.225 --> 10:32.627
Love you.

10:51.062 --> 10:54.494
Did I tell you I was thinking
about buying a mountain bike?

10:54.707 --> 10:56.188
Yes.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.390
Good.

10:59.271 --> 11:02.179
I wasn't sure if I had... told you.

11:04.991 --> 11:06.438
Looking forward to starting tomorrow.

11:06.439 --> 11:07.439
I've got a few ideas...

11:07.440 --> 11:09.458
You're just covering while
I have the operation.

11:09.459 --> 11:11.471
- Yeah, but I just want to...
- Your job is to answer the phone

11:11.472 --> 11:13.856
and make sure we don't have
any ants in the kitchenette.

11:13.876 --> 11:16.179
Yeah, I know, but if I'm gonna be
taking over one day I wanna...

11:16.199 --> 11:18.438
That's funny, I don't remember
asking you to take over.

11:20.495 --> 11:22.478
Do you have any other
children I'm not aware of?

11:22.479 --> 11:25.506
Daniel, I just need you to
answer the phone and babysit.

11:25.507 --> 11:27.107
No surprises.

11:27.127 --> 11:28.435
Fine.

11:31.872 --> 11:33.164
Oh, thank God!

11:33.184 --> 11:36.409
The last three houses I went to
thought I was a stripper-gram.

11:37.923 --> 11:39.482
- Is this where you grew up?
- What are you...?

11:39.483 --> 11:40.507
Wow. It looks so great. Oh!

11:40.508 --> 11:42.794
Um, Em, what are you doing here?

11:42.814 --> 11:46.004
Oh, Tasmania had a particularly
nice weather forecast this week.

11:46.024 --> 11:47.499
- Hello.
- Aren't you supposed to be in Bali?

11:47.500 --> 11:50.224
I'm fine, thank you.
Are you gonna introduce me?

11:50.244 --> 11:53.434
Um, Mum, this is Emma.

11:53.435 --> 11:56.470
Um, she's... visiting.

11:56.471 --> 11:59.164
Emma, this is my mum, Barbara.

11:59.184 --> 12:01.215
Daniel's told me a lot
about you over the years.

12:01.216 --> 12:03.743
Oh, it's all lies.

12:03.936 --> 12:05.857
I certainly hope so.

12:15.221 --> 12:17.211
Are you masturbating?

12:17.212 --> 12:19.224
Yes. Over this.

12:21.216 --> 12:22.820
You look like a mad scientist

12:22.840 --> 12:25.517
who's accidentally turned
himself into a child.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.881
Thank you.

12:26.901 --> 12:28.280
Very kind.

12:28.766 --> 12:32.872
Um, can we talk about what happened now?

12:32.892 --> 12:35.239
We can talk about what just happened.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.279
Robert De Niro movie, which
was, frankly, underrated.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.227
Emma, you've had a fight and panicked.

12:40.228 --> 12:43.092
You can't just run to me anymore.
Does Josh know where you are?

12:43.112 --> 12:44.392
Yes.

12:48.782 --> 12:49.792
No.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.080
- You're married now.
- He left.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.235
He left me. Yes.

12:56.236 --> 12:59.219
On our honeymoon, which turns
out is a thing that can happen,

12:59.220 --> 13:02.720
that I didn't even know I was
supposed to be worried about.

13:03.236 --> 13:04.436
Um...

13:05.904 --> 13:06.926
I'm sorry.

13:06.946 --> 13:10.226
I thought the honeymoon period was
supposed to last the honeymoon.

13:10.246 --> 13:14.147
Apparently he's been thinking about it
for a long time, which is humiliating.

13:14.167 --> 13:15.780
Then... then why the wedding?

13:15.800 --> 13:18.215
Well, he thinks he was in denial.

13:18.216 --> 13:20.852
And I was so excited about the
wedding that he c... I dunno.

13:20.872 --> 13:24.223
And then we had this
big fight, and, um...

13:24.224 --> 13:25.943
Can I break this?

13:27.196 --> 13:29.526
I actually had that since I was a kid.

13:30.980 --> 13:32.400
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

13:35.721 --> 13:37.227
We were at this restaurant on the beach

13:37.228 --> 13:39.263
and they had these, um,
tanks of live lobsters

13:39.264 --> 13:41.960
and I was drinking and I
thought they looked so sad

13:41.980 --> 13:43.899
- so I grabbed one.
- Out of the tank?

13:43.919 --> 13:46.005
Yeah, and I ran down the
beach towards the water

13:46.025 --> 13:47.191
to, you know, set it free.

13:47.192 --> 13:48.773
- That's very good of you.
- Well, I didn't make it.

13:48.793 --> 13:50.243
The waiter attacked me
before I could get it there.

13:50.244 --> 13:53.275
Anyway, Josh was furious.

13:53.881 --> 13:58.275
He said I'd embarrassed him again,
and he couldn't do it anymore.

13:58.911 --> 14:00.691
Well, that sucks, Em.

14:02.558 --> 14:04.240
And the lobster pinched me.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.643
Can I do anything?

14:11.823 --> 14:13.227
Uh...

14:13.228 --> 14:15.430
Clothes?

14:15.544 --> 14:19.200
My suitcase is mainly
sarongs and lingerie.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.400
My wardrobe too.

14:22.635 --> 14:24.494
We'll sort something out.

14:25.236 --> 14:26.239
Thanks.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.440
That's fine.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.045
If you need me, I'm right next door.

14:33.822 --> 14:36.191
I know. Goodnight.

14:36.713 --> 14:38.228
Goodnight, Em.

14:39.074 --> 14:41.204
- I'm not in bed yet.
- Oh, yep, sorry.

14:53.607 --> 14:55.627
- Is that a glass of milk?
- Yes.

14:55.647 --> 14:58.215
- It's for cereal.
- It's also for drinking.

14:58.216 --> 15:00.196
Are you Santa Claus?

15:05.091 --> 15:08.009
I need to stop in at the
doctors before we go in today.

15:08.029 --> 15:09.255
- Emma?
- Yes?

15:09.256 --> 15:11.235
What are your plans?

15:11.236 --> 15:13.626
Uhh... I thought I'd come with you.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.227
- I'm going to work.
- He's going to work.

15:16.228 --> 15:17.705
Yeah, I know. Please?

15:17.725 --> 15:20.228
I'll stay out of the way.
I just need the distraction.

15:20.229 --> 15:24.112
I just can't think about my
life too much right now.

15:26.220 --> 15:29.415
Well, you can't come into the
office looking like that.

15:36.220 --> 15:38.767
I feel like bunion is
wasted on a foot condition.

15:38.787 --> 15:40.215
It's a fun word.

15:40.216 --> 15:41.416
- Bunion.
- Hm.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.223
I'm sure one of them is...
dying, or something.

15:46.224 --> 15:49.223
All done. Congratulations
on the baby, you two.

15:49.224 --> 15:51.208
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

15:55.224 --> 15:57.203
Probably be a shit baby, I think.

15:57.204 --> 15:59.215
If you have any more questions,
Barbara, just call my mobile.

15:59.216 --> 16:00.416
I know.

16:04.236 --> 16:05.236
Grace.

16:05.237 --> 16:06.802
Hi, Daniel.

16:07.912 --> 16:10.215
Hi. Hi.

16:10.216 --> 16:11.652
Sorry I'm not more excited to see you.

16:11.672 --> 16:13.680
I've known for a few weeks
that you were coming back,

16:13.700 --> 16:16.647
and for the last 20 minutes
that you were sitting out here.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.685
Um, wh... what are you...

16:18.705 --> 16:20.247
What are you doing here?

16:20.248 --> 16:22.255
Uh, my rural placement.

16:22.256 --> 16:24.223
I can't wait to get out, to be honest.

16:24.224 --> 16:25.255
No offence, Barbara.

16:25.256 --> 16:26.525
I don't care.

16:26.545 --> 16:29.199
- Uh, sorry, this is, uh, Grace.
- Hi.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.062
- Hi.
- I haven't seen you since, um...

16:31.082 --> 16:32.577
- We broke up.
- Yes.

16:32.597 --> 16:35.199
Oh, you're Grace? Oh, I
have heard so many...

16:35.200 --> 16:37.195
- Uh, it's good to... uh, stop.
- Has he talked...

16:37.196 --> 16:38.248
- No, but... Stop, please.
- Oh.

16:38.249 --> 16:41.251
It's good to see you. You look,
um... you look... look great.

16:41.252 --> 16:43.004
I've lost 30 kilos.

16:43.024 --> 16:45.267
Well, it is a lot of, um, kilos.

16:45.268 --> 16:47.049
Well, it's just maths in the end.

16:47.069 --> 16:49.243
You eat less calories than
your body needs for fuel

16:49.244 --> 16:50.937
and you'll lose weight.

16:50.957 --> 16:53.283
Uhh, it is maths. Um...

16:53.284 --> 16:57.465
I mean, there's the number pi
and then there's real pies.

16:57.485 --> 17:00.271
I mean, you wouldn't want to eat
3.14 pies if you're losing weight.

17:00.272 --> 17:01.472
I'm sorry.

17:02.707 --> 17:05.211
Daniel, the surgeon will send
through a list of instructions

17:05.212 --> 17:06.260
for Barbara after her operation.

17:06.261 --> 17:08.191
Make sure she follows them.

17:08.192 --> 17:09.236
I'm standing here.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.876
- I will. I will.
- It's nothing.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.412
No, it's not nothing, Barbara.
It's a spinal fusion.

17:14.590 --> 17:16.542
Will Mum still be able to go
to the toilet by herself?

17:16.563 --> 17:18.192
- Jesus.
- Yes.

17:20.252 --> 17:22.239
You should come and see me some time.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.260
Uh...

17:23.261 --> 17:25.211
Yeah, I'd love to.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.247
I'd, um... I'd love that, yeah.

17:27.248 --> 17:29.232
You love getting a check-up?

17:31.228 --> 17:32.428
Yes.

17:34.064 --> 17:35.439
See ya later.

17:38.876 --> 17:40.208
Nailed it.

17:41.288 --> 17:45.203
There's two men in town
both called Dave Gouling.

17:45.204 --> 17:49.203
If one calls and he sounds old,
he's one of our best tenants.

17:49.204 --> 17:51.079
If he's got a high voice,
it's the other Dave.

17:51.099 --> 17:53.195
Hang up on him. He's prank calling ya.

17:53.196 --> 17:55.191
- Okay.
- Sorry, is this the whole thing?

17:55.192 --> 17:57.215
- Yeah.
- This is all of it?

17:57.216 --> 17:59.255
Yeah, the whole town's like
one supermarket aisle.

17:59.256 --> 18:01.275
I love it! It's like a toy town.

18:01.276 --> 18:03.220
Is that a craft shop?

18:04.260 --> 18:07.227
- How long?
- Just a little while if that's okay.

18:07.228 --> 18:09.231
- Is it a drug thing?
- Nope.

18:09.232 --> 18:11.223
Is it normal her turning
up on your doorstep?

18:11.224 --> 18:12.668
Yes, but please do not
ask too many questions.

18:12.688 --> 18:14.215
She's pretty upset right now.

18:14.216 --> 18:17.251
Did you see that guy in that car
did a country "I know you" nod

18:17.252 --> 18:19.051
to a lady on the street.

18:19.071 --> 18:20.231
Do you want one?

18:20.232 --> 18:21.432
Yeah.

18:23.220 --> 18:24.701
Seems upset.

18:24.721 --> 18:26.227
Does her family know about this?

18:26.228 --> 18:27.236
Uh, I'm sure they do.

18:27.237 --> 18:29.208
Sorry, that can't be right.

18:30.220 --> 18:32.195
The 24-hour emergency butcher?

18:32.196 --> 18:35.227
Emergency butcher? That's so weird.

18:35.228 --> 18:38.211
The woman who owns it, Liz out the
back, says she keeps it open.

18:38.212 --> 18:39.952
What's so weird about that?

18:39.972 --> 18:41.200
Nothing.

18:44.026 --> 18:46.252
- It is weird, right?
- Yeah.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.584
The printer only takes
paper from the blue tray.

18:50.604 --> 18:52.243
The paper in the red tray won't work.

18:52.244 --> 18:53.612
Why do we have that paper, then?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.876
Make sure you use the white
vinegar under the sink

18:55.896 --> 18:57.195
to clean the mould in the bathroom.

18:57.196 --> 18:58.248
Yeah, Mum, that's more of a life tip.

18:58.249 --> 19:00.255
Is there anything work-related
I can help you with today?

19:00.256 --> 19:03.192
An inspection? Follow up on a listing?

19:05.434 --> 19:06.711
We're out of milk.

19:18.240 --> 19:22.279
Hi, Mum. Um, Bali is lovely.

19:22.749 --> 19:24.259
No diarrhoea yet, no.

19:24.260 --> 19:27.271
Um, I know I haven't put any
photos up yet but we're just...

19:27.272 --> 19:30.247
we're just really busy
having a really good time.

19:30.248 --> 19:34.723
Oh. Oh, you know, like, um,
yesterday we were on the beach

19:34.743 --> 19:38.192
and had a coconut fight.

19:39.782 --> 19:41.068
Yes, it was dangerous.

19:42.253 --> 19:44.207
McCallum Real Estate.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.471
Hi, June.

19:46.123 --> 19:47.671
You're shitting me.

19:47.691 --> 19:49.279
I'll be right there.

19:49.781 --> 19:53.499
Sounds like 40 Katherine
Street's got a dog again.

19:53.843 --> 19:56.223
I'm going round. I can handle this.

19:56.224 --> 19:57.224
What?

19:57.225 --> 19:59.271
- The dog, let me take care of it.
- Like yesterday?

19:59.272 --> 20:01.227
Well, that was a bit
weird but this isn't.

20:01.228 --> 20:03.219
Just tell the tenant they
can't have a dog. Easy.

20:03.220 --> 20:05.247
Whoo, sounds exciting. Can I come?

20:05.248 --> 20:07.195
Yeah, it'll be like work experience.

20:07.196 --> 20:09.025
Aren't you a bit old
for work experience?

20:09.045 --> 20:10.200
Yeah.

20:10.268 --> 20:12.247
Must be great having
him here to help out.

20:12.248 --> 20:14.207
Two real estate agents
in the one family.

20:14.208 --> 20:17.108
- What are the chances?
- What are the chances?

20:17.592 --> 20:19.243
Fine. Let's see how you go.

20:19.244 --> 20:22.494
Yes. Thank you. You made
the right choice. Put 'em in.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.615
Mum's not keen. Let's go.

20:32.034 --> 20:33.830
Alrighty, who have we got?

20:33.850 --> 20:36.801
- Bruce... Nup. We're leaving.
- What?

20:36.821 --> 20:38.585
- It's Bruce Hardwick's house.
- Who?

20:38.605 --> 20:40.563
Bruce Hardwick, he used
to bully me at school.

20:40.564 --> 20:41.604
I'm not... I can't go in there.

20:41.605 --> 20:43.611
Are you serious? School was ages ago.

20:43.612 --> 20:45.611
Yeah, but he was relentless.
He stole my undies once.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.631
- Ohh, that's nothing.
- I was wearing them.

20:47.632 --> 20:49.595
Even got my safety pair.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.619
- He won't recognise you.
- I can't risk it.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.627
You told your mum you'd take care of it.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.607
Well, she's probably forgotten.
It was like 10 minutes ago.

20:56.608 --> 20:58.095
Hey, do you know why I'm here?

20:58.115 --> 20:59.607
Because of the honeymoon thing?

20:59.608 --> 21:00.620
Well, yeah.

21:00.621 --> 21:05.599
But also, to watch my best
friend kick arse at real estate.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.568
Have I wasted a trip?

21:08.636 --> 21:10.624
- No.
- Yes!

21:11.624 --> 21:13.548
All right, give me a sec.

21:18.572 --> 21:21.057
No, no, no, no, no, no!

21:36.953 --> 21:39.543
- I'm a lion.
- You're a what?

21:44.600 --> 21:45.916
Hello?

21:46.564 --> 21:47.764
Hello?!

21:52.096 --> 21:53.556
What are you guys doing here?

21:56.267 --> 21:59.567
Um, hi, ah, Bruce.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.623
We're from the real estate agency.

22:01.624 --> 22:04.159
Uh, y-y-your door was
unlocked, so we just...

22:04.179 --> 22:05.754
Oh.

22:05.774 --> 22:08.230
Yeah, I always think, uh...

22:08.250 --> 22:11.611
locks are keeping me in rather
than keeping people out.

22:11.889 --> 22:13.052
Cool.

22:13.072 --> 22:15.623
Yeah, we had a call you might
be keeping a dog here.

22:15.624 --> 22:18.363
No. No dogs here.

22:18.383 --> 22:19.612
All right, thanks for your time.

22:19.613 --> 22:21.066
Would you hang on? I mean...

22:21.086 --> 22:23.471
There... there's a dog bowl right there.

22:23.491 --> 22:25.608
- So what?
- Yeah, so what?

22:25.609 --> 22:27.560
- Could be anyone's.
- Daniel!

22:29.104 --> 22:30.998
You're not Danny McCallum, are ya?

22:31.018 --> 22:33.105
Uh...

22:33.106 --> 22:37.037
I haven't seen you since school.

22:37.038 --> 22:38.086
Where have you been?

22:38.087 --> 22:40.806
Well, actually, I've been on
the mainland. Came back to...

22:40.826 --> 22:43.631
- You couldn't hack it?
- Well...

22:43.651 --> 22:45.378
What did you used to
stick up your butthole?

22:45.398 --> 22:46.418
What?

22:46.438 --> 22:49.041
Yeah, you used to stick stuff
up ya butthole. What was it?

22:49.042 --> 22:51.093
No, that was a song you made up
about me. It never happened.

22:51.094 --> 22:54.089
This guy could not take a joke.

22:54.090 --> 22:56.271
This one time, we chucked
him off this cliff...

22:56.291 --> 22:58.073
Hey! It's awful those things
you did to him back then,

22:58.074 --> 23:00.650
and it's awful you bringing
them up now, okay?

23:00.670 --> 23:02.057
So what if he used to stick
stuff up his butthole?

23:02.058 --> 23:03.519
- Em...
- He was young. He was experimenting.

23:03.539 --> 23:05.041
I didn't stick anything up my butthole.

23:05.042 --> 23:07.301
- How is that helping?
- You should be proud of yourself.

23:07.321 --> 23:09.203
Bruce, we're here to
talk about your dog.

23:09.223 --> 23:10.292
Bones.

23:14.622 --> 23:16.065
See?

23:16.066 --> 23:17.485
That is the biggest dog I've ever seen.

23:17.505 --> 23:19.097
Not doing anything.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.467
It's like three dogs in a dog suit.

23:20.487 --> 23:22.089
Bruce, you can't have a dog here.
It's in the lease.

23:22.090 --> 23:23.733
What am I supposed to do? Kill it?

23:23.753 --> 23:25.098
No, isn't there someone
you can leave him with?

23:25.099 --> 23:27.493
- No one will take him, he's a menace.
- I don't think you could kill it.

23:27.513 --> 23:29.085
- We should call Barbara.
- I'm not calling Barbara.

23:29.086 --> 23:31.057
- She might be able to help.
- No, no, no, definitely no.

23:31.058 --> 23:32.258
No, no, no. Not on my first...

23:33.743 --> 23:37.954
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go get some
paperwork from the... the car.

23:55.058 --> 23:56.639
Yeah, I'll miss him.

23:56.659 --> 23:58.081
Thanks, Bruce. We really appreciate it.

23:58.082 --> 24:00.061
I'll just need a couple more
hours just to say goodbye.

24:00.062 --> 24:02.829
- Oh, yeah, sure. Whatever you need.
- Thanks, Bruce.

24:10.256 --> 24:11.954
- How did you...?
- Just kept being charming until

24:11.974 --> 24:14.045
he agreed to give it to a friend.

24:14.046 --> 24:16.030
And he was fine with that?

24:16.050 --> 24:18.337
Yeah. I mean, it's not
like he can't visit him.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.380
And I told him this way, he doesn't
have to clean up after him either.

24:20.381 --> 24:22.340
He just gets to do fun
hanging out stuff.

24:22.341 --> 24:26.275
You know, deep down, everyone
just wants to be a weekend dad.

24:26.857 --> 24:28.405
Okay, well... Great.

24:28.406 --> 24:31.776
Um, good. Uh... thank you.

24:32.049 --> 24:33.385
You're welcome.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.818
- Hey, when we tell Mum...
- Totally.

24:36.373 --> 24:37.373
Bullshit.

24:37.374 --> 24:40.336
It's true. Dan convinced him
to get someone to take the dog.

24:40.337 --> 24:41.385
Daniel?

24:41.386 --> 24:43.102
Ah, yeah, yeah.

24:43.122 --> 24:46.097
He came around eventually once
I took him through the lease.

24:46.117 --> 24:47.368
Impressed?

24:47.369 --> 24:48.369
A little.

24:48.370 --> 24:49.569
Put 'em in.

24:52.353 --> 24:54.349
You know how this works, right, Mum?

25:00.088 --> 25:02.372
I'll always be on my mobile.

25:02.373 --> 25:04.360
You've got the number for the
landline for the hospital?

25:04.361 --> 25:06.328
Yes. Yes. Mum, I could've driven you.

25:06.329 --> 25:07.377
- Call me any time.
- Yes.

25:07.378 --> 25:10.682
Any time I have any questions
about anything, I will.

25:11.373 --> 25:13.360
Ah. Oh!

25:13.361 --> 25:15.396
- Sorry, you okay?
- Yeah.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.433
I'll call you tomorrow.

25:18.353 --> 25:19.670
Emma?

25:20.163 --> 25:21.377
Yes?

25:21.575 --> 25:23.796
Stay away from the dishwasher.

25:25.341 --> 25:27.541
Bye, Mum.

25:46.744 --> 25:48.128
Shotgun your mum's bed.

25:48.148 --> 25:50.337
Nooo. No.

25:59.153 --> 26:00.389
I'm married.

26:00.819 --> 26:02.061
Yeah.

26:02.081 --> 26:03.814
Am I supposed to do
something about that?

26:03.834 --> 26:08.376
I mean, technically, right now,
I am married but I am single.

26:08.377 --> 26:10.392
What do you wanna do?

26:10.766 --> 26:13.377
I... have no idea.

26:15.361 --> 26:16.548
Well...

26:16.707 --> 26:22.394
I was thinking, if you are gonna
stick around a little longer...

26:22.795 --> 26:25.086
maybe you might like to work with me.

26:25.106 --> 26:26.178
Hm?

26:26.198 --> 26:28.392
If you hadn't been there today I never
would've gone to Bruce's house.

26:28.393 --> 26:31.316
- You would've.
- Nah, no, I wouldn't have.

26:31.317 --> 26:34.110
I mean, how... how would you feel
about helping me out at the office?

26:34.130 --> 26:35.361
I don't want to do any work.

26:35.362 --> 26:38.328
Well, we can discuss that but...
it'll be more fun with you there.

26:38.329 --> 26:39.529
- Well, obviously.
- Arrogant.

26:40.634 --> 26:42.328
I'll need shampoo.

26:42.329 --> 26:43.726
Pharmacy's closed.

26:43.746 --> 26:45.408
I can get you a steak.

26:45.921 --> 26:48.106
So you can stick it up your butthole?

26:49.349 --> 26:50.377
I'm glad you're staying.

26:57.923 --> 26:59.364
Bruce?

26:59.365 --> 27:00.393
Hey.

27:00.394 --> 27:02.360
- Where'd you want the dog?
- What?

27:02.361 --> 27:04.778
We might have a dog now.
Anything we should know?

27:04.798 --> 27:07.792
Yeah, he bites and he hasn't
had any of his shots.

27:24.992 --> 27:26.162
Oh, here we go.

27:26.182 --> 27:28.365
- Time to real estate.
- The locksmith's retired.

27:28.366 --> 27:30.845
I do not want Damien Nedbit
sneaking around my laundry,

27:30.865 --> 27:32.316
putting my pegs on himself.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.408
Is there a code of
ethics for locksmiths?

27:34.409 --> 27:35.743
I just cut keys.

27:35.763 --> 27:38.388
I like him. Upstanding citizen,
completely trustworthy.

27:38.389 --> 27:42.010
So ya haven't been breaking into our
homes and stealing our things?!

27:42.030 --> 27:43.365
He didn't take anything.

27:43.366 --> 27:45.349
- I did.
- Dammit.

27:47.349 --> 27:49.344
Why didn't you get a steak?

27:49.345 --> 27:50.368
She only had sausages.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.373
Did you get lamb and rosemary?

27:51.374 --> 27:53.396
- No.
- You should've. Or pork and fennel.

27:53.397 --> 27:55.352
It's for a dog.

27:57.405 --> 28:00.325
Run.
