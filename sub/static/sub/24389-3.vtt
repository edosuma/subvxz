00:11.270 --> 00:12.771
<i>Me versus the three sleepers?</i>

00:13.605 --> 00:15.222
It's David versus Goliath.

00:17.693 --> 00:20.821
<i>A sleeper car is a wolf
in sheep's clothing.</i>

00:20.904 --> 00:22.281
<i>I've always been told,</i>

00:22.447 --> 00:25.617
<i>"You're a girl, maybe you shouldn't be
going out there and drag racing."</i>

00:27.452 --> 00:29.329
<i>I'm basically an adrenaline junkie.</i>

00:29.454 --> 00:33.208
<i>We should be able to annihilate
the supercar with this Cadillac.</i>

00:35.877 --> 00:39.089
<i>Everyone has their vice
and mine is racing.</i>

00:42.884 --> 00:45.220
<i>I pretty much had to build
this car from scratch.</i>

00:45.470 --> 00:47.306
<i>You built it to do one thing,
take me out,</i>

00:47.598 --> 00:49.266
<i>I guess we'll roll and see
what happens.</i>

00:50.267 --> 00:53.812
That motor's been through three marriages,
three divorces, and a bankruptcy.

00:53.937 --> 00:55.647
Whoa!

00:55.731 --> 00:58.233
<i>Blake's accident,
that was the worst day of my life.</i>

01:00.777 --> 01:03.137
<i>When the green light hits,
my foot's to the floor.</i>

01:03.447 --> 01:04.739
<i>Let's fuckin' race.</i>

01:24.593 --> 01:27.387
<i>A lot of people don't like me
strictly 'cause of racing.</i>

01:29.514 --> 01:32.309
<i>They can't separate
racing and bullshitting.</i>

01:34.061 --> 01:37.272
<i>In Texas... racing's a big thing.</i>

01:38.315 --> 01:39.775
<i>My dad raced.</i>

01:39.858 --> 01:41.443
<i>My friends raced.</i>

01:43.153 --> 01:44.529
<i>That's all I know, is racing.</i>

01:44.780 --> 01:47.199
My dad was a huge influence
in my early years.

01:47.783 --> 01:49.826
<i>He bought my first junior dragster.</i>

01:51.203 --> 01:53.997
<i>My dad's a Ford guy and I'm a Ford guy.</i>

01:54.081 --> 01:55.832
You know, I think Chevys suck.

01:57.709 --> 02:01.713
Generally, your grandma or grandpa would
be driving an old Thunderbird...

02:02.422 --> 02:05.092
<i>but I have a ton of pride in this car.</i>

02:06.134 --> 02:10.138
<i>If my Thunderbird raced a supercar,
I don't see me having a problem.</i>

02:11.765 --> 02:13.225
I think supercars...

02:14.059 --> 02:15.102
is...

02:15.727 --> 02:18.522
a car for someone
who has more money than sense.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.489
Stefan's going to be real mad
when I catch the first fish.

02:27.572 --> 02:29.825
My sister Sarah is like
a girl version of me.

02:30.283 --> 02:33.662
<i>Sarah's into racing. I'm into racing.
I taught her how to drive.</i>

02:33.829 --> 02:35.497
It's a little guy, but it's a fish.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.290
Shut up.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.041
I'm a real...

02:39.543 --> 02:42.087
shy and... I don't want to be
the center of attention.

02:42.170 --> 02:44.464
I don't like it. He's helped me grow.

02:44.548 --> 02:46.427
<i>I'm very thankful that he's my brother.</i>

02:53.598 --> 02:55.809
<i>I met Blake
when I was about 24.</i>

02:56.309 --> 03:00.230
I didn't know how to weld, and I needed
some fabrication done on my car.

03:00.522 --> 03:03.275
<i>I took it to him.
He did a great job on it.</i>

03:03.358 --> 03:05.902
<i>From that day forward,
we were inseparable.</i>

03:05.986 --> 03:08.739
Blake was like his right-hand man.
They did everything together.

03:08.947 --> 03:11.074
<i>All of these cars,
Blake has helped me with.</i>

03:11.491 --> 03:14.244
<i>I mean, half these trophies
were all won with him.</i>

03:14.453 --> 03:15.829
Blake loved street racing.

03:16.037 --> 03:20.709
Blake's passion was just as strong
for cars, if not stronger than mine.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.655
I remember when I first met him,
I was like,

03:22.755 --> 03:24.463
"Dude, you need to go do something,"

03:24.588 --> 03:27.466
'cause that's all he did,
was work on cars non-stop.

03:27.841 --> 03:31.178
<i>We won so many races together,
and we traveled the whole country</i>

03:31.261 --> 03:32.615
and then Blake comes up to me.

03:32.715 --> 03:35.599
He's like, "Hey, do you care
if I ask your sister out?"

03:36.183 --> 03:39.269
So, he takes her out and they go out,
they start dating or whatever.

03:39.352 --> 03:42.481
<i>And, you know, they fall in love
and they had two kids.</i>

03:43.732 --> 03:47.277
<i>It made me happy that,
you know, they got together.</i>

03:47.694 --> 03:49.279
She couldn't have found a better man.

03:53.241 --> 03:54.576
<i>Blake called me up one night.</i>

03:54.659 --> 03:58.914
He said, "Hey, they got
a four-car shootout, $500 entry."

03:59.122 --> 04:00.999
<i>Naturally, I said, "Yeah, let's do it."</i>

04:01.917 --> 04:04.169
<i>He said, "Hey, will you drive the car?"</i>

04:04.461 --> 04:06.004
He was super nervous.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.882
<i>I told him, "No, dude.
You got this. You got this."</i>

04:09.549 --> 04:11.843
I wanted him to have the joy to win.

04:13.386 --> 04:14.846
<i>As soon as he takes off...</i>

04:15.180 --> 04:16.389
I'm like, "We won."

04:27.484 --> 04:29.658
<i>The drag racing
community is stunned.</i>

04:29.751 --> 04:33.198
<i>Twenty-three-year-old Blake Williams
was a husband and father of two.</i>

04:33.532 --> 04:35.909
<i>Another driver apparently
lost control and hit him,</i>

04:36.326 --> 04:40.247
<i>sending Williams's car into a tree
and throwing him from the vehicle.</i>

04:42.107 --> 04:43.500
That was the worst day of my life.

04:50.257 --> 04:53.176
<i>After Blake died,
Stefan watched over me.</i>

04:53.927 --> 04:55.554
<i>It's helped me a lot.</i>

04:56.513 --> 04:58.181
<i>Me and Blake wasn't family...</i>

04:58.932 --> 05:01.518
<i>but he was closer to me
than any blood I have.</i>

05:05.146 --> 05:08.149
<i>I'm the one who got rid of his car,
took it to the junkyard.</i>

05:09.192 --> 05:13.029
That's my little Blake wall, you know?
This is Blake's welding helmet.

05:13.738 --> 05:16.783
The mirror, the steering wheel,
the hood scoop, his helmet...

05:17.492 --> 05:19.536
I mean, that's stuff you can't replace.

05:20.036 --> 05:22.998
At first, whenever I used to come in here,
I used to get emotional.

05:23.331 --> 05:24.749
But I do all right now.

05:25.917 --> 05:26.917
Soâ€¦

05:27.586 --> 05:28.670
it's pretty hard.

05:30.255 --> 05:32.048
<i>I was able to save the motor...</i>

05:32.632 --> 05:34.009
the block heads...

05:34.384 --> 05:35.760
and his rear end.

05:35.927 --> 05:38.346
<i>And then two months after Blake died,</i>

05:38.430 --> 05:41.641
a bunch of people tagged me
on a car for sale on Facebook.

05:41.892 --> 05:44.769
It was just like Blake's old Thunderbird.

05:44.853 --> 05:47.249
I said, "This is perfect.
I'm gonna go get it."

05:47.499 --> 05:50.525
<i>It was a shell with nothing.</i>

05:51.151 --> 05:54.029
So, I pretty much had to build
this car from scratch.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.282
<i>I worked on that car for 12 hours a day.</i>

05:57.741 --> 06:00.702
I think I tried to do it to help cope.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.332
<i>Inside of the new Thunderbird,
we have Blake's engine.</i>

06:05.582 --> 06:07.334
<i>The engine is the heart of the car.</i>

06:07.709 --> 06:11.032
And Blake had a unique sound to his car.

06:11.171 --> 06:15.383
<i>And I tried keeping that unique sound.
And then everything else is brand new.</i>

06:15.634 --> 06:17.093
It's definitely a tribute car.

06:17.385 --> 06:20.805
<i>So, I was trying to make
a complete duplicate, like exact.</i>

06:21.431 --> 06:23.141
I finished building it yesterday.

06:26.102 --> 06:30.148
<i>I'm doing this race for my friend Blake,
and I don't want to lose.</i>

06:39.491 --> 06:41.034
<i>My name
is Shawnee Haggard.</i>

06:42.577 --> 06:44.454
<i>We are in Watauga, Texas.</i>

06:45.413 --> 06:47.749
People from Texas are very Texas-proud.

06:48.166 --> 06:52.128
<i>Here in Watauga, it's just...
It's a pretty quiet community.</i>

06:52.337 --> 06:54.255
We're the loudest out of everybody, so...

06:55.590 --> 06:58.718
<i>I bought the S-10 for about $3,000.</i>

06:58.969 --> 07:02.263
First week, I put a turbo 350 in it.

07:02.347 --> 07:04.349
<i>Then did the transmission.</i>

07:04.557 --> 07:06.935
<i>Every time I turn around,
we're adding something else to it.</i>

07:07.477 --> 07:11.439
<i>It's just a little truck with a big punch.
It's like me.</i>

07:11.815 --> 07:14.263
Just my Lilâ€™ 10.

07:18.989 --> 07:21.741
<i>Growing up,
my dad was in the army.</i>

07:22.367 --> 07:23.994
I was very much a tomboy.

07:24.119 --> 07:28.748
<i>In high school, I was on the rifle team.
I had talked to the Army recruiter.</i>

07:28.832 --> 07:32.127
<i>He told me that I couldn't be a sniper</i>

07:32.210 --> 07:35.505
<i>because they don't put females
on the front line.</i>

07:35.630 --> 07:37.966
<i>And then I found drag racing.</i>

07:41.219 --> 07:43.346
I've always been told, you know,

07:43.596 --> 07:47.183
<i>"You're a girl, maybe you shouldn't be
going out there and drag racing."</i>

07:47.892 --> 07:48.892
I didn't like that.

07:48.977 --> 07:53.398
Being a woman driver, it's difficult.
There's a lot of trash talkers out there.

07:53.481 --> 07:56.609
Bunch of grown men
that act like little babies...

07:58.153 --> 07:59.904
'cause they think, you know,
you're a girl,

07:59.988 --> 08:01.656
so they have a chance at beating you.

08:02.490 --> 08:05.243
<i>The Lil' 10 has
the fluorescent pink wheels on it,</i>

08:05.577 --> 08:08.204
<i>so the people up in the stands
can see that</i>

08:08.329 --> 08:10.582
<i>"Hey, that's a lady driving that truck."</i>

08:10.790 --> 08:12.959
It's a lot of fun beating the guys...

08:13.626 --> 08:16.963
<i>just because of the fact that
they get really pouty.</i>

08:17.756 --> 08:21.259
<i>I guess I'm doing this race
just to kind of prove to everybody</i>

08:21.342 --> 08:23.261
<i>that a girl can do it too.</i>

08:33.480 --> 08:35.982
That's big-block power right there, baby!

08:36.607 --> 08:38.234
Woo!

08:38.318 --> 08:42.155
<i>My name is Ryan Hall.
I've been racing my whole life.</i>

08:44.365 --> 08:48.536
<i>I think as a modern-day cowboy,
I'm basically an adrenaline junkie.</i>

08:49.204 --> 08:50.997
<i>There's first place and there's last.</i>

08:51.539 --> 08:54.125
<i>I mean, there's this... That's how I am.</i>

08:55.543 --> 08:58.421
<i>Once we do this race,
the proof's gonna be in the pudding,</i>

08:58.505 --> 08:59.881
<i>whenever we put it down.</i>

09:01.007 --> 09:04.427
We are gonna drag the damn paint
off a supercar in this car.

09:04.511 --> 09:08.515
I don't care what kind of supercar it is.
I'm gonna embarrass somebody.

09:10.266 --> 09:12.769
<i>I'm very determined to win.</i>

09:17.357 --> 09:20.151
<i>As a kid, I knew that I wanted
to be my own boss.</i>

09:20.235 --> 09:23.279
<i>My mentality from growing up
was just a hustler.</i>

09:23.363 --> 09:25.949
<i>You know, just do what you gotta do
to make a living.</i>

09:26.074 --> 09:28.493
During 2010, when the economy went south,

09:28.576 --> 09:31.079
I went through some rough patches
and some hard times.

09:31.621 --> 09:34.791
<i>But then a couple of years ago here,
one of my guys, Rick Bales,</i>

09:35.166 --> 09:37.502
<i>me and him came up with the idea
to start a speed shop.</i>

09:37.777 --> 09:40.113
<i>And so we came up
with Motorsports Mafia.</i>

09:44.175 --> 09:46.678
Here we are, building cars
and selling speed.

09:47.095 --> 09:49.806
It's, you know... It's a cool gig.

09:50.723 --> 09:53.685
<i>If you're having fun
at where you work, it's not really a job.</i>

10:00.984 --> 10:05.488
<i>A sleeper car is gonna be something
that looks inconspicuous,</i>

10:05.572 --> 10:08.241
<i>and you think, "There's no way
this car is gonna outrun this car."</i>

10:09.534 --> 10:13.788
<i>The Dadillac
is a '79 Cadillac Coupe de Ville</i>

10:13.872 --> 10:16.249
<i>that looks kind of "Mafieta,"</i>

10:16.833 --> 10:18.543
<i>or however you... Whatever that word is.</i>

10:19.294 --> 10:22.505
Mafioso... I'm sorry, "Mafioso,"
I guess, is the...

10:23.673 --> 10:24.883
correct pronunciation.

10:25.216 --> 10:28.511
<i>It's kind of a doo-doo maroon-brown color.</i>

10:28.720 --> 10:32.182
<i>It's probably one
of the ugliest cars I've ever seen.</i>

10:32.849 --> 10:37.020
Here's the stock engine that came
in this car, that Cadillac, in 1979.

10:37.351 --> 10:42.734
Uh... Maybe 250 horsepower, at the most.

10:42.901 --> 10:46.029
Back in the day, in 1979,
this was a cool motor.

10:46.112 --> 10:49.240
Nowadays, this would be basically
a yard ornament.

10:50.658 --> 10:52.702
So, here we got Old Blue,

10:52.869 --> 10:56.039
which is a truck I've had
for over 25 years.

10:56.247 --> 10:58.642
<i>Been known around here for years
for being a very fast truck.</i>

11:02.128 --> 11:04.339
<i>This truck has a lot
of sentimental value to me.</i>

11:04.464 --> 11:07.550
<i>It's been through three marriages,
three divorces, and a bankruptcy.</i>

11:09.177 --> 11:11.095
<i>I took everything out of Old Blue,</i>

11:11.304 --> 11:13.473
<i>took the motor, transmission,
the radiator,</i>

11:13.932 --> 11:16.309
<i>the shifter, all the gauges,
all the electronics,</i>

11:16.392 --> 11:19.187
<i>the rear end, everything,
and put it underneath this Cadillac.</i>

11:19.729 --> 11:22.815
<i>It is something that you could pull
up with and somebody's gonna think,</i>

11:22.899 --> 11:25.318
<i>"This car's not that fast.
Look how big it is."</i>

11:25.401 --> 11:28.446
<i>But... the Dadillac's a bad motherfucker.</i>

11:35.161 --> 11:39.332
<i>I'm Skip Reagan.
Military brat, never married, no kids...</i>

11:39.874 --> 11:42.335
<i>My dad was a Green Beret.
My mom's Japanese.</i>

11:42.418 --> 11:44.379
<i>They met after he was deployed in Vietnam.</i>

11:45.046 --> 11:46.798
<i>When I was in high school,</i>

11:47.382 --> 11:49.509
<i>my dad brought home a Porsche 928.</i>

11:50.635 --> 11:53.972
<i>And it was the first time
he let me drive something like that.</i>

11:55.640 --> 11:59.769
If you can get an erection from a car,
that was probably my first car erection.

12:01.813 --> 12:03.106
Did I share too much?

12:04.607 --> 12:07.443
<i>I was a small kid,
so, um, I was easy target.</i>

12:07.777 --> 12:10.697
<i>With that came the bullying,
and a lot of it.</i>

12:10.989 --> 12:12.949
<i>I used to get in a lot of fights.</i>

12:13.283 --> 12:17.745
<i>It started a progression for me.
I wanted to be bigger, stronger, faster.</i>

12:19.247 --> 12:23.334
<i>So, that, um... led over to a lot of
different parts of my life.</i>

12:25.086 --> 12:26.254
<i>Getting into gym...</i>

12:26.963 --> 12:28.172
<i>martial arts...</i>

12:29.507 --> 12:30.883
<i>and the racing.</i>

12:32.218 --> 12:36.597
<i>My car, 2016 Dodge Viper ACR-E...</i>

12:36.723 --> 12:39.225
<i>E for extreme.
Very limited production run.</i>

12:39.392 --> 12:42.145
<i>I had the first one in Dallas.
They don't make 'em any more.</i>

12:42.228 --> 12:45.481
<i>If you see my car,
you know exactly who's behind the wheel.</i>

12:46.983 --> 12:51.029
<i>She is vicious. Zero to 60,
sub-4 second range.</i>

12:51.237 --> 12:53.072
<i>A hundred and fifty-seven
thousand dollars.</i>

12:53.406 --> 12:57.368
<i>Plate says revenge.
Revenge is a life full of success.</i>

12:57.702 --> 13:01.664
And hopefully, she'll whoop some ass
here in a couple of days.

13:05.501 --> 13:07.170
<i>We're gonna meet
a buddy of mine...</i>

13:08.046 --> 13:10.590
Brent. He and I have raced together
for years.

13:10.965 --> 13:12.717
<i>We'll see what both cars throw down.</i>

13:14.635 --> 13:15.762
What's up, dude?

13:16.471 --> 13:18.222
- What's going on, man?
- Not much.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.308
Uh, I'm up against...

13:20.892 --> 13:23.478
sleepers. I hope
I can take those freakin' punks.

13:23.811 --> 13:26.064
I'm having trouble
hooking up the rear tires, dude.

13:26.147 --> 13:27.231
Even after I heat 'em up...

13:27.640 --> 13:29.817
um, she's still breaking loose on me.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.377
Let's do some launches, man.

13:31.504 --> 13:33.302
- Let's do it.
- My brother. Let's do it.

13:33.326 --> 13:35.031
<i>I don't like sleepers, not a fan.</i>

13:35.156 --> 13:38.493
<i>Guys who take a three
or five-hundred-dollar crap box</i>

13:38.576 --> 13:40.620
<i>and put 30 grand worth of motor in it...</i>

13:40.995 --> 13:43.623
You know, they go, "Oh, my car's
street legal." It's all crap.

13:44.540 --> 13:47.085
Okay, you built it do one thing,
take me out.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.893
I guess we'll roll and see what happens.

13:51.506 --> 13:55.176
<i>I have satellite navigation,
air conditioning, leather interior.</i>

13:55.426 --> 13:58.304
The girls turn heads.
You're not gonna go to a nice restaurant.

13:58.388 --> 14:00.515
You're not gonna take your gal
out on a date in that.

14:00.973 --> 14:03.768
<i>The reality is,
it's not a freakin' supercar.</i>

14:07.271 --> 14:10.775
- Something's not right.
- Is it this pink wire, Robert?

14:11.109 --> 14:13.152
Hold on. He's... He's tweaking.

14:15.029 --> 14:19.742
It's not a street car
without a Christmas tree Scentsy in it.

14:21.577 --> 14:22.787
Yep, try it.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.183
- She's losing spark somewhere.
- Yeah.

14:39.429 --> 14:40.805
- Hello. How are you?
- Hey.

14:40.888 --> 14:42.473
- Good. How's it going?
- Good.

14:42.765 --> 14:44.934
<i>My ex-wife, Brandy.
We co-parent together.</i>

14:45.059 --> 14:47.311
<i>We share fifty-fifty custody.</i>

14:47.437 --> 14:50.433
She'll drop off Isaiah. He really
likes hanging out here at the shop.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.984
He's at that age where he's into cars.

14:53.276 --> 14:55.116
So is that a sleeper car
y'all are gonna build?

14:55.278 --> 14:56.755
- That's it, right there.
- Yeah.

14:56.779 --> 14:58.549
- You haven't seen it, have you?
- No.

14:58.573 --> 15:00.442
- We call it the Dadillac.
- The Dadillac?

15:00.588 --> 15:02.910
That's what we call it, the Dadillac.

15:03.077 --> 15:04.957
Right now, we're having
some issues with the car

15:05.037 --> 15:06.789
getting the ignition to fire, so...

15:06.998 --> 15:07.952
Oh.

15:07.953 --> 15:09.647
Welcome to racing.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.414
Yeah, it's always something.
You know that.

15:11.636 --> 15:13.554
- Yeah.
- We're gonna win, huh?

15:13.754 --> 15:14.754
Yep.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.591
What do you win?

15:17.216 --> 15:18.496
- Bragging rights.
- Oh.

15:20.553 --> 15:24.640
- What would you want me to race?
- Probably a Lamborghini Centurion.

15:24.974 --> 15:28.436
Okay, well, I can tell you right now,
it is an American-made supercar.

15:28.644 --> 15:29.687
It is...

15:30.771 --> 15:33.441
a 2016 Dodge Viper...

15:34.484 --> 15:36.569
- ACR.
- Wow.

15:36.986 --> 15:39.071
That's it, right there,
that's what we're racing.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.740
That's gorgeous.

15:40.865 --> 15:43.951
At least it's American made.
It's not an European, you know?

15:44.035 --> 15:46.370
American steel against American steel.

15:46.704 --> 15:49.088
It's gonna look even better behind me.

15:49.290 --> 15:52.543
MSRP, 118,000.

15:53.127 --> 15:56.881
<i>Money doesn't always win,
and I want my son to be able to say,</i>

15:56.964 --> 16:00.092
<i>"My dad was able to outrun
a supercar in a 3,000 dollar,</i>

16:00.426 --> 16:02.470
'79 Cadillac Coupe de Ville."

16:02.720 --> 16:05.848
<i>And hope that drives him later
on in his life to know</i>

16:05.932 --> 16:07.850
<i>you can do anything you put your mind to.</i>

16:07.975 --> 16:12.355
Eleven-point-five at 127 mile an hour.
Six-hundred and forty-five horsepower.

16:12.688 --> 16:15.399
- We should be able to annihilate that.
- Yeah.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.404
Still nothing.
You got the ignition on?

16:20.863 --> 16:22.365
<i>We do have our disadvantages.</i>

16:23.074 --> 16:24.075
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:26.369 --> 16:27.369
Yeah.

16:30.831 --> 16:33.251
One day, we'll have everything
perfectly organized

16:33.334 --> 16:34.961
like a professional speed shop.

16:35.628 --> 16:36.837
No, we won't.

16:37.713 --> 16:38.839
Yeah, probably not.

16:39.924 --> 16:44.220
I found out we're racing
a Dodge Viper AXC Extreme.

16:44.554 --> 16:47.056
- ACR?
- Yeah, ACR. That's it.

16:47.139 --> 16:50.184
Got a lot of cool, nifty things
like navigation.

16:50.893 --> 16:53.854
Eight-point-four liter V-10,
six speed manual.

16:54.188 --> 16:57.400
- On here it's 141,000 dollars.
- Dang!

16:57.817 --> 17:00.319
- That's more than our house.
- Does he live in that thing?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.905
Top speed, 177 miles an hour.

17:03.614 --> 17:05.866
I think this plug's okay.
You want to look at it?

17:06.032 --> 17:08.368
I feel like there's more pride
in a sleeper car,

17:08.493 --> 17:12.999
just because you've built the vehicle
how you want it to be,

17:13.082 --> 17:17.627
where a supercar, in my opinion,
is just a bought entitlement.

17:17.752 --> 17:19.672
We got weight transfer,
which they don't have.

17:19.922 --> 17:23.384
We should be able
to run 650, 700 horsepower

17:23.509 --> 17:25.428
versus 650 horsepower.

17:25.761 --> 17:27.805
How you feel about running that Viper?

17:28.556 --> 17:31.475
- It's overrated.
- Nervous at all?

17:32.143 --> 17:34.454
- Yeah.
- You know that car is built for a track.

17:34.478 --> 17:36.022
It's not made for drag racing.

17:36.147 --> 17:39.650
Running from a dead stop, we got tires,
and we got weight transfer.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.361
We got your fast reaction time.

17:42.445 --> 17:45.281
Isn't the statistics on females
having quicker reaction time?

17:45.448 --> 17:47.908
Most females do have
a quicker reaction time,

17:48.284 --> 17:50.161
unless they race their husband, and...

17:50.620 --> 17:52.079
- What?
- Yeah.

17:52.830 --> 17:56.250
<i>I love to race, and I just kept
going out to the street races.</i>

17:56.334 --> 17:58.044
And that's where I met my husband.

17:58.628 --> 18:00.588
<i>He supports me in anything I do.</i>

18:00.755 --> 18:04.967
<i>He puts a big front of being a tough guy,
but he's really a softie.</i>

18:06.427 --> 18:08.471
<i>It's just like having an ace
in your pocket.</i>

18:08.888 --> 18:12.266
He's amazing. He's such a good guy.

18:16.103 --> 18:18.064
<i>I absolutely love
the fact she races.</i>

18:18.481 --> 18:21.150
<i>She's got a little speed demon inside
of her, for sure.</i>

18:22.318 --> 18:24.487
<i>We are there for each other.</i>

18:25.738 --> 18:29.909
<i>If I'm racing, she's helping me
and if she's racing, I'm helping her.</i>

18:33.537 --> 18:36.457
That's ten pounds of nitrous.
We roughly use about...

18:37.208 --> 18:38.584
three pounds per run.

18:39.418 --> 18:42.463
So, nitrous is really cold compressed air

18:43.047 --> 18:45.549
<i>and it sprays into the motor,</i>

18:45.841 --> 18:48.886
<i>which increases the motor capacity.</i>

18:49.095 --> 18:50.179
Go-fast juice.

18:51.806 --> 18:53.933
<i>I have full confidence
in you in this race.</i>

18:59.814 --> 19:02.316
Stefan, let me hear
you bang your nitrous.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.456
That's right.

19:05.569 --> 19:07.947
I'm the wild one,
and Eileenâ€™s the conservative one.

19:08.239 --> 19:11.534
<i>She definitely keeps me on the straight
and makes me do right.</i>

19:11.784 --> 19:13.452
Racing's a huge part of my life.

19:13.703 --> 19:16.872
<i>My wife gets mad at me 'cause
she thinks it's one of my top priorities.</i>

19:17.248 --> 19:19.083
She gets pretty pissed, if I have to say.

19:20.876 --> 19:25.297
<i>I plan on raising my son
the same way as my dad raised me,</i>

19:25.381 --> 19:27.508
<i>at the track, messing with cars.</i>

19:28.509 --> 19:30.511
You know Daddy's
gonna be in a big race.

19:30.928 --> 19:31.886
Yeah.

19:31.887 --> 19:34.098
- You want to see how we're gonna do it?
- Yeah.

19:34.265 --> 19:36.642
- We got a four-lane road.
- Yeah.

19:37.226 --> 19:39.019
- We're gonna be this one, right?
- Yeah.

19:39.103 --> 19:42.773
Okay. So, there's gonna be
four cars, all lined up...

19:43.107 --> 19:44.936
- to race.
- Uh-huh.

19:45.025 --> 19:50.906
A sleeper, a sleeper, a sleeper...
and then a slow supercar. Boo!

19:51.087 --> 19:52.087
Uh-huh.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.535
Okay. So, who you think's
gonna win the race?

19:55.161 --> 19:57.204
- It's that one.
- 'Cause that's Daddy, right?

19:57.288 --> 19:58.581
- Yeah.
- My man.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.972
<i>I'm a huge fan of music.
I used to deejay.</i>

20:15.097 --> 20:17.516
Actually, uh, I deejayed at a strip bar.

20:18.017 --> 20:22.438
<i>My house is decorated
like a bachelor-type Spartan.</i>

20:22.521 --> 20:26.400
<i>I don't like having things
that people typically have.</i>

20:26.484 --> 20:28.402
<i>I've been described by many people
as a peacock,</i>

20:28.486 --> 20:30.780
<i>'cause I always like to garner attention.</i>

20:31.947 --> 20:34.408
It's Texas. We shoot,
and we shoot a lot.

20:34.909 --> 20:37.244
My weapons collection is about 130.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.331
I love guns. I love fast cars.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.626
I get very competitive when I shoot,
just like when I drive.

20:46.587 --> 20:51.217
<i>This is Japanese katana.
It was the weapon of the samurai.</i>

20:51.383 --> 20:54.887
<i>They knew this blade in and out.
You're only as good as your weapon.</i>

20:55.137 --> 20:57.723
But in the right hands,
you could just wreck someone's world.

20:57.932 --> 20:59.099
Same deal with my driving.

21:07.525 --> 21:09.109
<i>Used to have a hot rod shop.</i>

21:09.193 --> 21:11.946
<i>I had huge aspirations
of what that place could've been.</i>

21:12.196 --> 21:15.908
<i>And my partners,
they were just not good people.</i>

21:16.033 --> 21:18.953
<i>When that shop collapsed,
financially, it was hell.</i>

21:19.328 --> 21:20.788
<i>They cost me almost everything.</i>

21:20.913 --> 21:23.999
<i>I lost over a quarter million dollars
in less than seven months.</i>

21:24.250 --> 21:28.872
To remind me of where I was
in the low point in my life,

21:29.004 --> 21:30.339
<i>I got the revenge plate.</i>

21:31.173 --> 21:33.050
I don't like to lose. At all.

21:33.551 --> 21:36.762
And I lost big there, financially...

21:37.596 --> 21:40.474
emotionally. But if you're lucky...

21:41.016 --> 21:43.519
<i>life gives you, um, a best friend.</i>

21:44.895 --> 21:47.815
<i>When I got Deedee, I had to be present.</i>

21:48.399 --> 21:50.734
<i>I used to drink a lot.
But she sobered me up.</i>

21:50.860 --> 21:53.404
That dog raced with me a lot.

21:53.612 --> 21:56.282
<i>Win or lose, I still got a kiss
from her in the end. So...</i>

21:56.949 --> 21:58.075
I was good to go.

21:59.159 --> 22:00.911
I lost her not too long ago.

22:01.453 --> 22:04.456
<i>She used to have on a collar,
little charm.</i>

22:04.540 --> 22:06.584
<i>I had it made
into a lapel-style pin.</i>

22:06.750 --> 22:08.363
<i>I wear it with me when I race now.</i>

22:08.713 --> 22:10.393
<i>It's kinda like
she's still riding with me.</i>

22:14.008 --> 22:15.301
<i>She was a good damn dog.</i>

22:16.302 --> 22:18.762
When she was with me,
felt like I couldn't lose.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.347
<i>We'll win this together.</i>

22:23.851 --> 22:24.935
Now try it.

22:27.271 --> 22:28.522
Flashing red light.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.134
Is that cutting power off?

22:30.357 --> 22:33.485
When it comes to wiring,
that's where I want to pull my hair out.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.407
- You know that's the motor out Old Blue?
- Yeah, Old Blue is...

22:39.617 --> 22:41.493
- Okay.
- Okay?

22:41.577 --> 22:43.829
- Well, yeah.
- For Old Blue, it was nasty.

22:44.079 --> 22:45.359
- Oh, okay.
- It was what it was.

22:45.706 --> 22:47.541
Again.

22:52.046 --> 22:53.046
Kill it.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.909
- What have we got?
- Whoa!

22:55.933 --> 22:56.985
You're running lean.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.637
It was very lean.
Header caught the plug wire on fire.

23:01.305 --> 23:03.057
Evidently, it's running too lean

23:03.390 --> 23:06.352
and it has caught a plug wire on fire.

23:06.852 --> 23:09.172
Could the whole car catch
on fire because of this?

23:09.313 --> 23:11.899
- Could it? Yeah. It could. It could.
- Mm-hmm.

23:13.525 --> 23:15.125
We're gonna make sure that don't happen.

23:15.444 --> 23:16.737
<i>These cars are dangerous.</i>

23:16.820 --> 23:19.615
People get hurt every day doing this
and die every day doing this.

23:20.324 --> 23:22.660
I always pray for you when you go
to the races,

23:22.743 --> 23:25.746
- whenever something bad's happening.
- That means a lot.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.290
It means a whole lot.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.170
- We're gonna win this for you.
- Yep.

23:35.756 --> 23:37.925
<i>To hear my son talk
about praying for me...</i>

23:40.094 --> 23:42.179
it just lets me know
that I'm doing the right thing.

23:43.013 --> 23:44.765
I hold that very close to my heart.

23:50.479 --> 23:51.999
- It's dead.
- No fire.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.194
Deep breaths.

23:58.195 --> 23:59.655
Have you plugged into the grid?

24:00.572 --> 24:03.132
- No, we haven't.
- Let's plug into the grid and check it.

24:04.326 --> 24:06.829
If there's a wire short somewhere,
we'll fix it.

24:07.538 --> 24:10.416
So, basically, what this is,
is a poor man's launch control.

24:11.166 --> 24:14.670
A supercar has high tech,
things that do it for it.

24:15.295 --> 24:16.880
<i>This is what we use.</i>

24:17.673 --> 24:20.050
<i>This box runs the ignition timing...</i>

24:20.217 --> 24:22.344
<i>and when you've done
such an extensive build</i>

24:22.428 --> 24:24.930
<i>like we've done here,
you're gonna miss little wires,</i>

24:25.014 --> 24:27.766
<i>or there may be a connection
somewhere that you overlooked.</i>

24:27.850 --> 24:30.728
<i>It makes me very nervous,
having these issues,</i>

24:30.936 --> 24:33.564
<i>but I will do everything in my power
to win this race.</i>

24:34.023 --> 24:35.063
You got the key on?

24:43.532 --> 24:46.410
This is our... our wall of glory.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.704
This is things that...

24:49.246 --> 24:51.999
when things go wrong in street racing.

24:53.751 --> 24:56.754
A little memento from Shawnee's truck.

24:57.212 --> 24:59.590
This is pretty much what's left
of the transmission.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.277
But that's her first trans...
that's not her first transmission.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.887
- That's my second transmission.
- Second or third.

25:05.095 --> 25:06.764
There is a drag racing prayer.

25:07.056 --> 25:10.642
Lord, I pray as I race today,
keep me safe along the way.

25:10.726 --> 25:15.064
Not only me but the others too,
as they perform the jobs they do.

25:15.189 --> 25:17.733
We've had a few friends wreck

25:17.941 --> 25:21.195
and so, it's surreal
when accidents happen.

25:21.445 --> 25:24.281
We put racing seats, and harnesses, and...

25:24.364 --> 25:26.867
- Yeah.
- ...we just, we got fire jackets, so.

25:27.201 --> 25:30.579
We focus more on the safety
than the performance, and then...

25:30.996 --> 25:33.116
You get one life, you know?
You need to live it right.

25:43.967 --> 25:47.471
Normally, whenever people have
accidents, it pushes them away.

25:50.891 --> 25:53.477
But it's made Sarah more into racing.

25:54.561 --> 25:56.772
<i>Blake died probably a year ago.</i>

25:57.272 --> 25:59.733
<i>Today will be the first time
Sarah sees the car finished.</i>

26:00.818 --> 26:02.945
- Surprise.
- It's beautiful.

26:03.695 --> 26:05.239
You did a great job.

26:07.449 --> 26:08.992
<i>It turned out really nice.</i>

26:09.076 --> 26:11.912
<i>Like, I'm really shocked
with how nice it turned out, honestly.</i>

26:11.995 --> 26:14.998
It's difficult seeing Stefan build
a Thunderbird

26:15.082 --> 26:17.835
that looks just like Blake's.

26:17.960 --> 26:21.463
<i>'Cause it still has parts off
of Blake's car from when he crashed it.</i>

26:21.672 --> 26:23.298
- You want to hear it?
- Yes.

26:32.266 --> 26:35.227
<i>It feels good
just to hear Blake's motor run again.</i>

26:37.354 --> 26:40.732
It's like he's still...
it's still his car. He's still there.

26:45.946 --> 26:48.157
- What do you think?
- It's fucking bad-ass.

26:48.323 --> 26:49.658
- Sounds good, right?
- Yeah.

26:53.370 --> 26:55.581
All we need to do
is just check the tires

26:55.831 --> 26:57.511
and we should be ready
to make some passes.

27:07.467 --> 27:09.553
<i>I grew up in a pretty
harsh environment.</i>

27:09.678 --> 27:11.930
<i>I seen things a lot of kids
shouldn't have seen.</i>

27:12.222 --> 27:15.934
I can remember, you know,
being scared and praying to God.

27:16.185 --> 27:19.313
<i>And at 16 or 17 years old,
I had moved out on my own</i>

27:19.563 --> 27:22.024
<i>and was selling drugs,
getting hooked on drugs.</i>

27:22.274 --> 27:24.067
<i>My mother and my grandmother
actually came</i>

27:24.151 --> 27:26.403
<i>and rescued me
and took me to a rehab,</i>

27:26.612 --> 27:29.281
which was probably one of the best things
that ever happened to me.

27:29.364 --> 27:32.242
It give me a chance to really see
where I had went south 'cause...

27:33.035 --> 27:33.993
Hellfire.

27:33.994 --> 27:36.330
...there's a lot of people
that have told me, they're like,

27:36.413 --> 27:38.853
"Ryan, we always expected you
to be either dead or in prison."

27:39.291 --> 27:41.210
I have no regrets
from what I went through.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.337
I think it's made me the man I am today.

27:44.922 --> 27:45.922
Try it.

27:47.674 --> 27:49.051
We got fire!

27:54.556 --> 27:56.850
<i>We're here for the first time
to test the car.</i>

27:57.935 --> 27:59.895
<i>There ain't no telling
what this thing's gonna do.</i>

28:03.774 --> 28:06.109
Since it's a brand-new car,
I'm pretty nervous right now.

28:06.318 --> 28:10.280
<i>I'd be pretty happy if it went A to B,
you know, didn't give me no problems.</i>

28:10.530 --> 28:11.782
No hero shit.

28:24.461 --> 28:26.021
<i>I'm gonna let this bitch sing.</i>

28:31.260 --> 28:32.260
Oh, shit.

28:33.845 --> 28:35.472
It broke a rocker arm, didn't it?

28:35.555 --> 28:37.435
- It sounded like it.
- Sounded like it.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.810
That sucks.

28:42.229 --> 28:44.564
<i>Like, 95% sure
it was a rocker arm.</i>

28:44.690 --> 28:47.192
<i>Blake was famous
for breaking rocker arms.</i>

28:47.276 --> 28:49.486
<i>Like, almost every time
we took the car out.</i>

28:49.611 --> 28:52.406
<i>So, that's why it didn't shock me
that it was a rocker arm.</i>

28:52.614 --> 28:54.241
He's giving us trouble.

28:54.825 --> 28:56.535
He's making sure we know he's here.

29:05.544 --> 29:09.172
<i>We were actually having some issues
with the car, but now it's running.</i>

29:09.589 --> 29:11.300
Here we go, baby!

29:12.968 --> 29:14.511
<i>Today we're gonna
do some tests,</i>

29:14.636 --> 29:16.430
'cause most of the cars
we're gonna be racing

29:16.513 --> 29:19.599
are probably 1,000 to 1,500 pounds
lighter than we are.

29:19.891 --> 29:23.312
This is gonna be kind of the maiden test.
Knock on some fake wood.

29:25.105 --> 29:26.732
Now it's time to see what she's got.

29:37.367 --> 29:39.995
<i>As a kid, I always felt like
I was in last place,</i>

29:40.078 --> 29:41.997
<i>and I was determined
to get to first place.</i>

29:43.081 --> 29:45.801
<i>Everybody is always, like,
"You can't do that, 'cause you're a girl."</i>

29:46.209 --> 29:48.003
You want to change
out the bottle?

29:48.086 --> 29:49.338
<i>Well, yes, I can.</i>

29:49.588 --> 29:53.383
<i>I love racing, and I love going
out there and showing these boys up.</i>

29:56.303 --> 29:57.846
So, you see this thing right here?

29:59.181 --> 30:00.640
It's not supposed to be right there.

30:00.849 --> 30:02.809
This is the one
that Blake welded together.

30:02.893 --> 30:05.228
You know what? I think,
I'm just gonna throw these on.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.815
When it's things that need
to be fixed right away,

30:08.899 --> 30:12.319
he just shuts down and focuses
and it's awesome to see him work.

30:17.783 --> 30:18.909
Start it up.

30:29.002 --> 30:31.122
The preparation I've got to do
for this race...

30:31.838 --> 30:33.090
I've been doing what I can.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.258
<i>Tires are new. They're broken in.</i>

30:35.592 --> 30:36.718
The car is solid.

30:37.219 --> 30:40.472
<i>Revenge is winning on race day,
no matter what.</i>

30:40.722 --> 30:42.808
Nothing feels better than winning.

30:46.103 --> 30:49.189
<i>I'm ready. When the green light
hits, my foot's to the floor.</i>

30:49.981 --> 30:51.608
<i>I think I have a fighting chance.</i>

30:53.860 --> 30:55.700
<i>We basically built this car
in ten days.</i>

30:55.779 --> 30:58.698
I'm gonna pull the teeth out
of the supercar with this Cadillac.

31:07.124 --> 31:09.209
- How'd it feel?
- Like a Dadillac.

31:12.921 --> 31:15.048
<i>So, we got the car
back together,</i>

31:15.132 --> 31:18.135
but I'm gonna try and make the first pass
on the car, see what happens.

31:31.565 --> 31:34.192
<i>If Blake was here,
he'd say, "That's a bad bitch."</i>

32:01.636 --> 32:04.473
<i>The main thing I'm worried
about is the rocker arm breaking.</i>

32:04.556 --> 32:07.767
<i>But I think all the little problems
are mostly figured out.</i>

32:08.018 --> 32:09.811
<i>I'm not good with the anticipation.</i>

32:10.479 --> 32:12.063
<i>Just ready to kick some ass now.</i>

32:12.439 --> 32:13.815
Your competition.

32:16.651 --> 32:19.321
That thing's pretty cool.
You see the ghost flames?

32:19.404 --> 32:20.447
Yeah.

32:21.031 --> 32:24.075
- Don't look that fast, but it's nice.
- It doesn't, but you never know.

32:25.827 --> 32:29.122
- It's a lot quieter than ours.
- Watch her run us all over.

32:31.333 --> 32:34.419
<i>I'm ready for the race to start.
I'm ready to get out there.</i>

32:35.795 --> 32:37.547
- Stefan. How you doing?
- Shawnee.

32:37.631 --> 32:39.511
- Hi. I'm Eileen.
- What y'all got in there, LS?

32:39.549 --> 32:40.759
That's an LS.

32:40.842 --> 32:42.886
- Yeah.
- That's cute. I like it.

32:42.969 --> 32:44.262
Yeah, I like the flames.

32:44.346 --> 32:46.032
- I like the pink wheels.
- Thank you.

32:46.056 --> 32:47.057
Thank you.

32:47.265 --> 32:48.642
- Good looking car.
- Thank you.

32:48.725 --> 32:49.893
She's a tank.

32:50.268 --> 32:53.313
<i>I'm ready to just get at it.
I don't like talking so much.</i>

32:53.647 --> 32:56.125
- Is she under the car looking?
- I don't know.

32:56.149 --> 32:58.527
I feel like y'all just looked up my skirt.

33:00.153 --> 33:02.447
What's that look like to you
from way down there?

33:02.531 --> 33:05.450
It's a two-door Caddy.
'78 model, something like that.

33:05.825 --> 33:07.327
I may not have the heaviest car here.

33:07.577 --> 33:09.680
- That's a lot of car.
- I know him.

33:09.704 --> 33:12.457
He goes out to the track all the time.
He's a big track guy.

33:12.707 --> 33:14.467
What's that sticker
say on the back?

33:14.501 --> 33:15.501
Motorsports Mafia.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.462
That's the guy, Ryan Hall.

33:18.255 --> 33:20.840
<i>I plan on winning this race.
I feel confident.</i>

33:20.966 --> 33:22.968
Oh yeah, that is
Ryan Hall right there.

33:23.176 --> 33:25.554
Bet you they got a big ol' motor
in that thing.

33:25.679 --> 33:27.472
That's definitely unexpected.

33:33.019 --> 33:35.205
- This is gonna be good.
- All right, how you doing?

33:35.305 --> 33:37.208
I knew it would be somebody I knew
when they said,

33:37.232 --> 33:39.859
it had pink wheels on,
I was like, "I know who it is."

33:39.943 --> 33:42.070
- How you doing?
- How's it going, man? How you doing?

33:42.279 --> 33:45.240
Man... y'all came for real?

33:45.323 --> 33:47.742
Man, we're trying. Pop the hood.

33:49.119 --> 33:50.161
Oh, boy.

33:51.329 --> 33:52.497
What does this thing weigh?

33:52.664 --> 33:55.344
- Forty-five hundred, yeah.
- I know it looks heavy.

33:55.417 --> 33:58.003
I thought I was gonna be
the only one with a grandpa car.

33:58.086 --> 33:59.170
Y'all stole my thunder.

34:02.299 --> 34:04.426
- Wow.
- I was expecting some pink in here.

34:04.634 --> 34:06.219
Nice little truck.

34:06.303 --> 34:09.389
<i>I know the truck. It's a fast,
little truck. Don't underestimate it.</i>

34:09.556 --> 34:11.837
- Y'all want to look under my hood?
- Yeah, we got time...

34:11.891 --> 34:15.061
I'll show and tell y'all today.
All y'all had to do is ask.

34:15.186 --> 34:16.563
Let's set it on the ground.

34:16.688 --> 34:17.813
- The ground?
- Yeah.

34:18.356 --> 34:21.150
Blake used to have
a Thunderbird just like this one.

34:21.234 --> 34:22.985
- Yes.
- We knew Blake.

34:23.402 --> 34:27.032
Everyone knows about Blake's accident.
Racers, we're like one big family.

34:27.489 --> 34:30.034
I felt it right in your heart,
'cause it's somebody you know.

34:30.243 --> 34:31.620
<i>We were close to the same age.</i>

34:33.746 --> 34:36.123
- It's pretty straight?
- Go up a little on the right.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.210
Yeah, that's a good-looking
sticker there.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.795
When I was pulling up, I was thinking,
"Holy crap,

34:42.297 --> 34:44.174
that looks just like, you know,
Blake's car."

34:44.257 --> 34:47.385
The Thunderbird literally brought chills
down me and I thought, "Wow."

34:47.594 --> 34:49.846
<i>Blake Williams, he was just like us</i>

34:49.929 --> 34:53.475
<i>and he died doing what he loved.
It's like losing one of your brothers.</i>

34:54.516 --> 34:58.104
- It's been a mad thrash to get it running.
- As long as we beat the supercar.

34:58.313 --> 34:59.814
No, yeah, I know, I hear you.

35:03.818 --> 35:04.903
Oh, boy.

35:05.445 --> 35:06.988
That Dodge Viper.

35:07.197 --> 35:09.115
God damn,
that wing is obnoxious.

35:09.491 --> 35:10.784
God damn!

35:13.953 --> 35:15.288
Yeah, that's not done.

35:15.497 --> 35:16.623
<i>The car is prepped.</i>

35:16.706 --> 35:19.167
<i>She smells good,
she tastes good, she looks good.</i>

35:19.751 --> 35:23.546
Normally, whenever people are looking
for revenge, bad stuff done happen to 'em.

35:23.672 --> 35:24.881
Yeah, right.

35:24.964 --> 35:27.217
We could use that wing as a dining table.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.495
<i>It's definitely
a nice car,</i>

35:31.680 --> 35:34.224
<i>but is it set up for drag racing?
I don't think so.</i>

35:34.432 --> 35:35.743
- Good to meet you.
- Skip Reagan.

35:35.767 --> 35:36.887
Thanks for coming out, Skip.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.395
- Morgan. Nice meeting you.
- Skip.

35:39.104 --> 35:40.980
<i>Does that shirt really have
his picture on it?</i>

35:41.481 --> 35:43.233
Is this thing set up for racing?

35:43.316 --> 35:46.069
Well, I'll see what I can do
swinging against you boys.

35:46.277 --> 35:47.696
- And girl.
- Oh.

35:48.029 --> 35:50.532
Freaking sweet! My bad. My bad.
I apologize.

35:50.824 --> 35:53.410
Real quick, can I...
Am I allowed to?

35:53.493 --> 35:54.869
Sure, take a look.

35:56.246 --> 35:58.581
Talk to me, dude.
What is the monster here, brother?

35:58.832 --> 36:01.292
Called the Dadillac.
It's all steel, all real.

36:01.835 --> 36:03.044
God Almighty.

36:03.586 --> 36:04.879
Hell of a setup.

36:08.049 --> 36:10.510
So, this was a tribute car
to a buddy of mine that passed.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.512
He had an identical Thunderbird.

36:12.595 --> 36:14.835
- What happened to your buddy?
- He died.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.559
Wow, I'm sorry, bro.

36:17.767 --> 36:19.602
- Valve cover's for him?
- Yeah.

36:21.439 --> 36:23.356
- Gas bottles in the trunk?
- Yeah.

36:24.441 --> 36:26.192
Secret sauce or can you say how much?

36:27.110 --> 36:29.112
- We got 300 on it.
- Okay.

36:31.698 --> 36:34.159
Just checking everyone's
rear suspension setup.

36:34.367 --> 36:36.786
Yeah, so it's a stock 53
with a cam,

36:36.995 --> 36:38.747
little shot of nitrous and...

36:39.414 --> 36:40.623
that's all she wrote.

36:40.707 --> 36:42.792
You mind sharing
how big your shot might be?

36:43.126 --> 36:45.545
- It's enough.
- It's enough? All right.

36:45.837 --> 36:49.340
<i>The car I'm most concerned
and worried about, gal running the pickup.</i>

36:49.424 --> 36:52.010
<i>Her setup stem to stern
is pretty damn legit.</i>

36:52.218 --> 36:54.220
These guys brought some cannons
out to the field.

36:54.304 --> 36:57.682
There's a hell of a lot of motor
and nitrous, so I'll have to slug it out.

36:58.057 --> 37:00.602
All right. So, drivers,
come on in please.

37:00.727 --> 37:03.008
Before we get started,
I want to thank you for coming out.

37:03.188 --> 37:05.231
Whoever wins this race
will go on to compete

37:05.315 --> 37:07.692
in the grand finale
at El Mirage, California.

37:08.485 --> 37:11.488
All right. Please, go ahead and take this
opportunity to walk the track.

37:11.780 --> 37:13.865
- Hey, guys, let's walk the lane.
- Babe!

37:14.282 --> 37:15.282
Come on.

37:15.950 --> 37:17.118
Got to walk her?

37:17.368 --> 37:18.703
I can already feel this...

37:21.539 --> 37:22.916
I'm gonna have to pedal there.

37:23.124 --> 37:26.204
This right here is probably
where that Viper might start catching up.

37:26.419 --> 37:29.099
We got this frickin' turd
sticking up out of the ground here.

37:29.297 --> 37:31.007
I'm the only one that has...

37:31.508 --> 37:32.717
real grooves in my tires.

37:33.051 --> 37:36.179
The Thunderbird looks fucking
like a bad bitch compared to them.

37:36.471 --> 37:39.808
I better hope I don't miss a shift.
I better hope they slip a little bit.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.771
I better hope my tires grip
all the way through.

37:42.143 --> 37:43.983
- We're ready to rock and roll.
- Yeah.

37:45.522 --> 37:48.233
I'm ready to do this.
May the best man or woman win.

37:48.650 --> 37:49.984
Let's fuckin' race.

37:55.114 --> 37:57.784
<i>We're here to win.
There is no other place but first.</i>

37:59.285 --> 38:02.205
<i>Four-wide race, there's not
a whole lot of room for error.</i>

38:03.039 --> 38:04.374
<i>I'm just ready to go.</i>

38:04.999 --> 38:07.210
<i>I'm feeling super,
super anxious.</i>

38:07.293 --> 38:09.337
<i>I want to get going.
I want to get racing.</i>

38:09.629 --> 38:11.029
<i>We're gonna whoop their ass.</i>

38:32.068 --> 38:33.588
- Love you.
- Love you, babe.

38:34.153 --> 38:37.156
<i>We're all friends, but you know,
once I get up on the line, it's...</i>

38:37.240 --> 38:38.449
<i>It ain't no friends.</i>

38:58.052 --> 39:00.138
<i>This race is
for my dog, Deedee.</i>

39:00.680 --> 39:02.891
<i>If I win today,
I'll be fucking stoked.</i>

39:04.350 --> 39:06.453
<i>My son Isaiah,
he couldn't be here with us today.</i>

39:06.477 --> 39:08.271
<i>But I know he's praying for me.</i>

39:09.105 --> 39:11.482
<i>When I win, it'll show
other women, you know,</i>

39:11.566 --> 39:13.401
<i>"Hey, just 'cause
you're a female doesn't mean</i>

39:13.484 --> 39:15.278
<i>you're limited to sticking
in the kitchen."</i>

39:17.238 --> 39:19.240
<i>I'm doing this for my family.</i>

39:19.449 --> 39:21.326
<i>Winning this
is gonna mean a lot.</i>

40:01.449 --> 40:02.492
Fuck.

40:14.295 --> 40:15.672
- Good job.
- Thanks.

40:17.173 --> 40:18.424
Blake would be proud of you.

40:18.925 --> 40:19.925
Thank you, buddy.

40:19.968 --> 40:22.637
I have Blake in mind
just about every day.

40:22.720 --> 40:27.100
<i>And I put my heart and soul in this car
and that engine did real well.</i>

40:27.183 --> 40:30.603
<i>So, I come out here and dominate everyone.
It's an overwhelming feeling.</i>

40:30.687 --> 40:33.690
I'm not gonna have a big head,
but I knew he was gonna win.

40:35.316 --> 40:36.943
- No?
- Something's not right.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.487
You know, we spent so many hours,
there's probably just some

40:39.570 --> 40:41.450
switch or something that
we didn't double-check.

40:42.365 --> 40:44.450
Hell of a launch, dude.
Hell of a launch, man.

40:44.534 --> 40:45.827
- That thing was gone.
- Shit.

40:46.035 --> 40:48.204
Damn, dude. Dude,
you were on fucking fire.

40:48.579 --> 40:51.416
I came out hard and had
I had more space, I think,

40:51.499 --> 40:53.334
well, I know I could've roped them in.

40:53.418 --> 40:56.379
We're still having them review the film,
because we can't handle a loss.

40:56.462 --> 40:58.589
<i>- </i> That was a hell of a thing.
- That's understandable.

40:58.756 --> 41:01.342
I'm never happy losing, but...

41:01.676 --> 41:02.676
I can swallow it.

41:03.085 --> 41:05.722
<i>He was racing for a hell
of a good cause in Blake's memory</i>

41:05.805 --> 41:08.266
<i>and I'm guessing the guy's
smiling down on him right now.</i>

41:08.349 --> 41:10.727
Hell, he's using his motor
to whoop all of our asses.

41:10.810 --> 41:13.021
- Hey, good race, man.
- Awesome race.

41:13.104 --> 41:16.315
I feel like Stefan
has really upheld Blake's name.

41:16.649 --> 41:18.484
<i>He couldn't be
a better person to lose to.</i>

41:19.193 --> 41:22.321
The official results, the good news is,
it was a clean start.

41:22.739 --> 41:25.299
So, thank you very much.
Everybody went on green, so outstanding.

41:25.658 --> 41:27.160
First, Stefan in the Thunderbird.

41:30.955 --> 41:33.624
Very close finish
between second and third.

41:33.708 --> 41:34.917
We had to review the tape.

41:35.126 --> 41:38.379
That was extremely close, but Skip,
you took it.

41:38.463 --> 41:40.631
Good job.

41:40.715 --> 41:43.468
Shawnee, you did really, really well.
You were really close.

41:45.803 --> 41:47.638
Couldn't have lost
to a better cause with...

41:48.222 --> 41:49.849
with this being in memory of Blake.

41:51.768 --> 41:52.852
Thank you.

41:52.935 --> 41:56.064
Win, lose, or draw, you know,
I'm happy with the car no matter what.

41:58.691 --> 42:00.860
<i>The car has a special
meaning to me and...</i>

42:01.152 --> 42:02.862
<i>it's something that I'll keep forever.</i>

42:06.240 --> 42:08.534
<i>It's gonna be around
for a long time in my family.</i>
