- Oh. Ooh!

17:24.842 --> 17:28.844
- What's the matter, pal?
- Nothing! Just, uh--

17:28.846 --> 17:31.647
Practicing being a seal.
[laughs]

17:31.649 --> 17:35.251
[imitates seal barking]

17:37.320 --> 17:38.821
- Hm!

17:38.823 --> 17:41.223
- [barking]
Ow!

17:41.225 --> 17:42.992
- Patrick,
Dr. Mundane always says,

17:42.994 --> 17:45.694
"If you can't bite,
things ain't right."

17:45.696 --> 17:49.398
- Okay, SpongeBob.
I guess I have to

17:49.400 --> 17:51.534
get my tooth
to the Tooth Fairy.

17:51.536 --> 17:54.537
- Ha, you rube.
There is no such thing

17:54.539 --> 17:56.505
as the Tooth Fairy.
- Ah!

17:56.507 --> 17:59.341
Squidward!
- It's all a bunch of

17:59.343 --> 18:00.476
made up baloney.

18:00.478 --> 18:01.577
- It is not baloney!

18:01.579 --> 18:04.647
- It is baloney!
- Who's got baloney?

18:04.649 --> 18:06.515
- [sighs] There is no
baloney!

18:06.517 --> 18:08.818
Just like there is
no Tooth Fairy.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.986
In fact, if you could
prove there were

18:10.988 --> 18:13.923
a Tooth Fairy,
I would eat, oh--

18:13.925 --> 18:15.491
a bucket of chum!

18:15.493 --> 18:16.325
both: Ew!

18:16.327 --> 18:17.726
- Squidward, why would
you want to do that?

18:17.728 --> 18:19.762
- I said I would,
only if there was

18:19.764 --> 18:22.765
a Tooth Fairy, and since
there isn't a Tooth Fairy,

18:22.767 --> 18:26.302
I will never have to eat
a bucket of chum.

18:26.304 --> 18:28.037
- Patrick,
I've been your friend

18:28.039 --> 18:28.771
for a long time.

18:28.773 --> 18:29.872
I would never
lie to you.

18:29.874 --> 18:31.740
You need Dr. Mundane's help
so you can

18:31.742 --> 18:32.975
get your tooth
to the Tooth Fairy.

18:32.977 --> 18:37.546
- That's okay, SpongeBob.
I think I can manage.

18:37.548 --> 18:38.681
Hmm, yah!

18:38.683 --> 18:39.915
[humming]

- Ahh!
[alarm bell ringing]

18:49.727 --> 18:50.793
[grunts]
- You see, Patrick,

18:50.795 --> 18:52.495
we have got to
get that tooth out.

18:52.497 --> 18:54.497
- You'll have to
catch me first!

18:54.499 --> 18:56.031
Oh!
- Patrick, wait!

18:56.033 --> 18:57.766
- Ha ha,
Tooth Fairy.

18:57.768 --> 19:00.069
What a couple
of molar morons.

19:00.071 --> 19:01.770
[crashing]
Ow!

19:01.772 --> 19:04.039
[panting, screaming]

Ahh.

19:51.088 --> 19:52.087
[barking]

19:52.089 --> 19:54.790
- Mipsey, Pipsey,
you bad girls!

19:54.792 --> 19:57.760
You get back
on this leash.

19:57.762 --> 19:58.861
[whining]

19:58.863 --> 20:00.429
- Well, you may have
called off your worms,

20:00.431 --> 20:03.766
but I'm not coming down.
- Patrick, they weren't mine.

20:03.768 --> 20:06.869
- A likely story.
- [sighs]

20:06.871 --> 20:09.405
Patrick, can I show you
something?

20:09.407 --> 20:10.806
[grunting]

20:10.808 --> 20:12.975
- What's that?
- It's a scrap book

20:12.977 --> 20:14.510
of all my baby teeth.

20:14.512 --> 20:15.844
Heh, that was a good one.

20:15.846 --> 20:16.745
I remember every tooth.

20:16.747 --> 20:18.614
Even though they're no longer
in my mouth,

20:18.616 --> 20:20.983
I still keep the memory
of them in my heart.

20:20.985 --> 20:24.119
- [laughs] I thought you kept
them in the scrapbook.

20:24.121 --> 20:26.388
- Patrick, don't you think
your baby tooth

20:26.390 --> 20:29.391
wants to see all his old
friends on Tooth Island?

20:29.393 --> 20:30.426
- Don't listen to him!

20:30.428 --> 20:33.929
I still have all my baby teeth,
and look at me!

20:33.931 --> 20:36.065
Ahh!

we can go.

I'm ready, Doc.
Do what you have to do.

20:45.509 --> 20:47.042
Ahh.
[yanking]

20:47.044 --> 20:48.811
- I'm done.

20:48.813 --> 20:51.747
- That's it?
- That's it.

20:51.749 --> 20:52.448
- Aw.

20:52.450 --> 20:54.783
Aw, you're going under
my pillow

20:54.785 --> 20:59.088
so you can go
to Tooth Island, my sweet boy.

21:09.233 --> 21:11.600
SpongeBob?
- Ha! I was right!

21:11.602 --> 21:14.436
The Tooth Fairy
isn't real.

21:14.438 --> 21:16.038
- Oh, SpongeBob.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.573
- Patrick,
you don't understand!

21:17.575 --> 21:19.441
I'm just helping
to get your tooth

21:19.443 --> 21:22.077
to the Tooth Fairy.
- Oh, that's a good one.

21:22.079 --> 21:24.880
- It's true!
- How can I believe you?

21:24.882 --> 21:30.085
Oh, the lies!
The chicanery! [sobs]

21:30.087 --> 21:31.453
- [laughs]

21:31.455 --> 21:33.889
Look at how betrayed
Patrick feels!

21:33.891 --> 21:36.458
Oh, this was totally
worth staying up all night.

21:36.460 --> 21:38.560
- You don't believe
there's a Tooth Fairy?

21:38.562 --> 21:42.164
Well, follow me
and I'll show ya.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.600
Behold, the Tooth Ferry!

21:44.602 --> 21:46.068
[ship horn blares]

21:46.070 --> 21:47.503
This is where parents
and friends

21:47.505 --> 21:50.506
take teeth so they can be
ferried to Tooth Island.

21:50.508 --> 21:53.676
- There really is
a Tooth Ferry!

21:53.678 --> 21:55.210
- Of course.

21:55.212 --> 21:57.112
- Hm--wha!

This is yours.

22:18.502 --> 22:20.135
- Could you wait till
I'm asleep

22:20.137 --> 22:22.271
and put it
under my pillow?

22:22.273 --> 22:23.939
- Mm, sure Patrick.
Anything for a pal.

22:26.811 --> 22:28.777
you're going,

22:28.779 --> 22:30.813
- [groans] Ah!
Hey, come on!

22:30.815 --> 22:33.082
This is just a big
misunderstanding!

22:33.084 --> 22:36.185
Ferry, fairy:
They're two different words

22:36.187 --> 22:37.853
that just happen
to sound alike!
