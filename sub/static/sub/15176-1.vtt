Laura.

Help me!

06:16.444 --> 06:19.146
-(Christmas music plays)

06:24.885 --> 06:27.087
-Ho ho ho.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.792
-I want a Barbie doll

06:31.892 --> 06:33.861
and a bicycle...

06:35.496 --> 06:37.130
and roller skates...

06:39.199 --> 06:40.601
and ballet shoes,

06:40.701 --> 06:43.070
and a Mickey Mouse watch,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.072
and a doll--

06:45.172 --> 06:48.375
(screams)

06:48.476 --> 06:50.611
(gasping)
-Easy, easy, easy, easy.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.480
Laura, Laura,
it's okay, it's all right.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.615
You're just dreaming.
You were just dreaming.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.617
You're back now.
It's all right.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.319
All right,
just lie down.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.622
That's it.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.191
That's it.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.093
Just lie down.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.795
There, that's it.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.931
Okay, have a look here.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.767
-Ah.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.235
Ah, Doctor.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.605
-Now...

07:18.506 --> 07:19.773
tell me.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.511
What was it?
-I dreamed I could see.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.045
-That's normal.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.880
And what else?

07:28.248 --> 07:31.018
-Well, nothing really.
It was just a crazy dream.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.120
-That's what
you're here for,
to dream.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.155
What kind of a dream?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.928
-A dream about Christmas

07:41.028 --> 07:43.731
obviously because
tonight is Christmas Eve.

07:43.831 --> 07:47.134
-And what about Christmas?
-(laughs)

07:48.235 --> 07:49.670
Santa Claus.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.773
-Laura, tell me what
you saw in your dream.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.545
-I told you, Dr. Newbury,

07:57.645 --> 07:59.847
Santa Claus.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.217
-All right,
let's try this again.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.553
Maybe we're
onto something.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.854
Can we try this
again, Laura?

08:06.954 --> 08:09.189
-Anything for you,
Dr. Newbury.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.925
-Good.

08:20.668 --> 08:24.037
I think--
I'm not sure--

08:25.272 --> 08:27.675
but I think
she made contact.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.032
-(no audible dialogue)

08:58.772 --> 09:01.208
-(Laura gasps)
-Assistant: Doctor.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.713
-What is it, Laura?

09:07.114 --> 09:08.616
What did you see?

09:11.819 --> 09:13.253
-Can I go
to the bathroom?

09:15.756 --> 09:17.257
-Help her, will you?

09:20.728 --> 09:23.764
Subject may be making contact.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.068
Can't be certain

09:28.168 --> 09:32.840
if subject's reaction
and mental response

09:32.940 --> 09:35.108
of coma victim
are connected.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.780
I wonder if she's
playing games with me.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.651
-(door closes)

09:43.684 --> 09:45.518
-Even if she does
make contact

09:45.653 --> 09:46.720
with the coma victim,

09:46.820 --> 09:49.289
she may not be aware
she's doing so.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.127
She may just be
denying her powers...

09:56.396 --> 09:58.531
but I can't help feel

09:58.666 --> 10:02.035
she's holding
something back.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.480
-Are we almost through, Doctor?

10:13.714 --> 10:15.215
-Almost.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.985
Just one more try.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.353
Okay?

10:22.022 --> 10:23.456
Are you with me, Laura?

10:23.657 --> 10:25.125
-Yeah, okay.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.929
Now, this time...

10:29.863 --> 10:31.799
I would like you
to really...

10:32.800 --> 10:34.735
relax, all right?

10:34.835 --> 10:37.104
Just empty your mind...

10:38.405 --> 10:40.107
of everything,

10:40.207 --> 10:41.775
all the thoughts,

10:41.875 --> 10:44.211
all the clutter.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.946
Okay?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.884
Let sleep take you away.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.888
Let the dreams come.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.893
Let the dreams come...

11:00.961 --> 11:02.896
and take you away.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.000
Go...

11:08.468 --> 11:10.270
Go with the dreams, Laura.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.340
(whispers)
Go wherever the dreams go.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.346
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.883
Nothing.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.319
Just sleep...

11:27.888 --> 11:29.456
and dream...

11:32.392 --> 11:34.294
and dream...

11:37.765 --> 11:39.399
and dream, Laura.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.471
Dream...

11:47.775 --> 11:49.409
and dream.

11:53.781 --> 11:56.149
Dream, dream.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.253
-(no audible dialogue)

12:05.192 --> 12:07.360
-(beeping)

12:34.888 --> 12:37.825
-(Laura screams)

12:37.925 --> 12:39.459
-Laura! Laura!
Easy, easy, easy.
-No! (cries)

12:39.559 --> 12:41.929
-Laura, Laura,
it's a dream.
It's a dream.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.831
-(cries)
-Easy. It's okay.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.332
-Here's some water, Laura.
-It's all right.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.067
-Right here.

13:22.035 --> 13:25.138
-(artificial breathing)
-(pinging)

13:26.373 --> 13:28.241
-So that's all?
That's it?

13:28.341 --> 13:30.610
A scary Santa?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.112
-That's it.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.514
-And that's all
you can tell me?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.118
-Uh-huh.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.254
What time is it, Doctor?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.256
My brother is
picking me up.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.259
-Huh, I'm sorry.
It's late.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.162
You're going out
of town for Christmas?

13:49.262 --> 13:52.499
-Yeah, my grandmother's
got a house out in the country,

13:52.599 --> 13:54.334
in Piru.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.272
-You're going to Peru?
-(laughing) No.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.908
-Piru.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.176
It's up in the North end
of the valley.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.146
-Well, you have a good time

14:06.246 --> 14:08.481
and we'll continue
after the holiday break.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.751
Oh, and, uh,

14:11.919 --> 14:12.953
thank you for the oranges.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.155
-Granny's got
a million of 'em.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.396
Doctor...

14:27.067 --> 14:29.402
I don't think I want
to do this anymore.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.112
-Remember, I warned you

14:39.212 --> 14:40.647
that this would
require...

14:41.681 --> 14:43.350
a kind of courage.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.986
-Well, you have
other volunteers.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.487
-I understand.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.589
Certain psychic abilities

14:49.689 --> 14:51.959
can be... frightening.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.327
-I'm not scared.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.629
-Maybe you should be.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.233
On the other hand...

15:01.268 --> 15:03.470
maybe it was wrong
for me to expect...

15:04.671 --> 15:06.974
someone so young

15:07.074 --> 15:10.143
could venture into
these uncharted areas.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.745
-Well, talk about it
after Christmas.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.082
Okay?
-Yes, okay.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.117
-Good bye, Doctor Newbury.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.395
-Woman over PA:
Dr. Wallace, report to
operating room one.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.533
Dr. Adam Wallace, report
to operating room one.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.506
-(sighs)

15:51.018 --> 15:52.852
-You think
she made contact?

15:53.086 --> 15:54.887
-I think...

15:55.022 --> 15:57.424
that she is playing
little girl games.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.860
Her body may be young,

16:01.028 --> 16:03.596
but her soul is old,

16:03.696 --> 16:06.033
older than we can imagine.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.534
-You think she'll come back?

16:07.634 --> 16:10.537
-She's gone too far.
She'll be back.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.674
And then
she'll let me go
as deep as I want.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.212
She likes it...

16:20.613 --> 16:22.249
loves it.

16:23.416 --> 16:27.720
Knowledge,
she can't resist it.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.691
She wants to
penetrate his mind...

16:33.726 --> 16:35.628
see what he sees...

16:38.798 --> 16:40.700
the way that he sees it.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.117
-(indistinct chatter)

16:57.217 --> 17:00.320
-(phone rings)
-(hospital chatter)

17:02.189 --> 17:04.757
-Woman: Captain Hank,
report to emergency.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.467
-My brother's coming
to pick me up.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.236
Could you let me know
when he's here?

17:16.336 --> 17:18.271
-I'm very busy, Miss.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.608
-Well, if you see
a red jeep outside,

17:22.709 --> 17:24.144
will you let me know?

17:24.243 --> 17:26.346
-I'll do my best.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.549
-(whispers) Bitch.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.751
-Excuse me?

17:34.454 --> 17:36.423
-Woman:
Dr. Evans, report
to gynecology.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.559
Dr. Evans,
report to gynecology.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.298
-Thank you.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.741
-(phone ringing)

17:58.878 --> 18:00.480
-Mount Memorial?

18:06.219 --> 18:07.554
-(phone clicks)

18:18.398 --> 18:21.168
-Nurse Corin,
please report to reception.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.836
Nurse Corin,
please report
to reception.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.577
-(no audible dialogue)

19:51.624 --> 19:52.959
-Excuse me.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.797
Miss?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.401
Hey!

20:02.435 --> 20:04.437
Hey, excuse me?

20:06.706 --> 20:09.208
Hey, what's
wrong with you?

20:25.892 --> 20:28.395
-(screams)

20:29.228 --> 20:32.699
(screaming)

20:32.799 --> 20:34.467
-Hey, Laura.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.304
Hey, sis.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.506
Come on.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.676
-Is she all right?
-Yeah, she's fine.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.447
-Merry Christmas.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.483
-Not for you.

20:52.319 --> 20:56.323
-Hey.
-Sorry, I couldn't help it.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.725
-Remember that girl
I was telling you about?

20:58.825 --> 20:59.626
Jerri?

20:59.726 --> 21:01.328
-Oh, the aerobics instructor?

21:01.361 --> 21:03.663
-No, the stewardess.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.332
-You're gonna bring
this friendly skuzz

21:05.432 --> 21:06.733
to granny's for the weekend?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.200
-How'd you know?

21:08.401 --> 21:10.837
-I'm psychic, remember?

21:10.937 --> 21:12.372
-Do you mind?

21:12.472 --> 21:13.973
-I'll get over it.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.443
-Thanks.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.654
Let's try to get
an early start

21:27.754 --> 21:31.358
and leave around 2:00.
-Uh-uh, got my shrink at 3:00.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.760
-Then we leave later,
pea brain.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.897
-Do you know how
pea brain gets his belt off?

21:37.997 --> 21:39.566
-How?

21:41.368 --> 21:43.269
(laughing)
You're sick.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.037
-I'm not.
-(engine starts)

21:56.783 --> 21:59.251
-Okay, Timmy, you be
a good little boy, now,

21:59.386 --> 22:00.587
and take your medicine,

22:00.687 --> 22:02.088
and Merry Christmas.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.823
Ho ho ho!

22:04.957 --> 22:08.528
Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Santa.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.797
-Want to lick
my candy cane, little girl?

22:10.897 --> 22:12.432
Ho ho ho.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.834
Dr. Rothman, please report
to nutrition.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.970
Dr. Rothman,
please report to nutrition.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.117
-Now, what have we got here?
-(door closes)

22:33.152 --> 22:35.588
"Coma victim."

22:36.556 --> 22:39.659
Hey, Ricky,
want a drink?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.929
What's that?
Vegetables don't drink?

22:43.029 --> 22:44.063
Great, pal.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.166
More for me.
Cheers.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.701
(burps)

22:48.801 --> 22:50.102
Cheers.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.673
-(dramatic music plays)

22:57.510 --> 22:58.878
-(sighs)

22:58.978 --> 23:00.580
Hey, vegetable!

23:00.680 --> 23:03.049
Who's your
favorite singer?

23:03.149 --> 23:06.653
Perry "Coma"?
(laughing)

23:07.454 --> 23:09.922
* Fly me to the moon

23:10.022 --> 23:13.993
* Let me play
among the stars *

23:14.093 --> 23:16.463
(laughs)

23:16.563 --> 23:18.998
Ho ho ho!

23:33.580 --> 23:35.482
What the fu--

23:35.515 --> 23:37.083
Hey, buddy.
Easy, boy.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.485
You're not well.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.653
Hey, Ricky,
about the broccoli,

23:40.753 --> 23:42.855
I was just kidding,
seriously.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.223
Want a drink? No!

23:44.491 --> 23:46.626
No! No!

23:46.726 --> 23:49.028
-You were hostile
to the receptionist

23:49.128 --> 23:52.098
after telling Dr. Newbury
you were quiting his experiment.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.568
-She was a bitch.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.570
-But you felt angry
towards her?

23:57.670 --> 24:00.673
-Yes.
-And Dr. Newbury?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.308
Does he make you angry?

24:02.509 --> 24:05.778
-I guess so.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.815
-That's probably
why you imagined
the receptionist dead.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.951
You took revenge
against her in your mind.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.623
-I--

24:16.723 --> 24:18.424
I don't know.

24:18.525 --> 24:21.393
-Laura, I want
to talk more about

24:21.594 --> 24:23.362
those unusual experiences

24:23.530 --> 24:25.798
you say you've been having
since you were a child...

24:26.633 --> 24:28.400
seeing things, if you will.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.670
-After the plane crash,

24:30.770 --> 24:33.005
when my parents died...

24:34.541 --> 24:35.742
I told you, Doctor,

24:35.842 --> 24:37.544
I don't really see things.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.078
-But you see them
in your mind.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.747
What does it feel like?

24:40.847 --> 24:42.582
Can you describe it to me?

24:42.682 --> 24:44.917
-It's a creepy feeling.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.588
A warm sensation
in my spine,

24:48.688 --> 24:50.890
and I get chills on my arms.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.660
-Go on.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.696
-My grandmother says

24:56.796 --> 25:00.032
all our thoughts
are just pieces of
one big thought.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.969
We just think
about the little pieces,

25:03.069 --> 25:04.737
but sometimes
we're thinking about

25:04.837 --> 25:06.706
the same little piece
as someone else.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.575
-(chuckles) Hm-hmm. Yes.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.710
Scientists have been
saying for years

25:10.810 --> 25:12.579
that animals communicate
in this way.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.714
I believe it.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.749
My Airedale, Earnest,
every time I go away,

25:16.849 --> 25:18.951
he knows before
I'm even packing.

25:20.587 --> 25:21.721
He starts to whine.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.591
It's like a special sense
that most of us don't have

25:24.624 --> 25:26.893
or if we do,
don't know how to use.

25:26.993 --> 25:30.129
You might call it
extra sensory perception.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.299
-You mean
I'm not crazy,

25:33.600 --> 25:35.134
for an Airedale.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.604
-(chuckles)

25:37.670 --> 25:40.506
Laura, when you say
you're having visions

25:40.607 --> 25:43.509
of the past or flashes
of future events,

25:43.610 --> 25:45.044
I'm not doubting you,

25:45.144 --> 25:48.815
but I am wondering
if something else is going on.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.651
-Like what?

25:51.751 --> 25:55.722
-Laura, I'm not
criticizing you.

25:55.822 --> 25:59.125
I'm trying to put you
in touch with your anger.

25:59.225 --> 26:03.896
The plane crash,
losing your parents
while you survived,

26:03.996 --> 26:07.634
the fact that you're blind
and others aren't...

26:07.700 --> 26:10.236
There's a pool of anger
inside of you

26:10.336 --> 26:12.338
and you have
to let it go.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.876
You need to reach
out to people.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.646
Let people help you
cross the street

26:19.679 --> 26:21.781
even if you can
do it yourself.

26:22.649 --> 26:25.184
Trust people more.

26:25.284 --> 26:28.254
Who said you have
to be the world's champion
blind orphan?

26:28.354 --> 26:31.057
-But, Doctor...

26:31.157 --> 26:34.193
will I stop seeing
these creepy things?

26:34.293 --> 26:36.896
I hate it.

26:36.996 --> 26:40.032
I don't want
to see the future
or the past...

26:40.900 --> 26:42.835
or anything weird.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.437
I just want to be normal.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.206
-Laura...

26:48.240 --> 26:52.912
no one is... normal.

26:53.012 --> 26:55.281
-(screams)

27:34.186 --> 27:35.154
-Yes?

27:35.254 --> 27:37.189
Well, can I help you?

27:39.125 --> 27:41.260
(screams)

27:42.294 --> 27:44.030
(receptionist screams)

28:06.886 --> 28:08.054
-Laura, this is Jerri.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.322
Jerri, this is Laura.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.362
-I never shake
on the first date.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.766
-Don't mind Laura.
You should see her
when she's really pissed.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.633
-Well, it's nice
to meet you anyway.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.102
Chris tells me
you're psychic.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.604
-Chris tells me
you give great head.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.173
-Jesus, Laura.

28:27.273 --> 28:28.808
-Oops.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.877
-I'm good with
my hands too.

28:48.928 --> 28:52.664
Let's see, you take
the 5 onto the 126

28:52.799 --> 28:54.333
and then you turn left.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.804
-Forget the map.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.039
(Laura's voice echoes)
You take the 101
to Moorpark Road.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.208
It's the way we always go.

29:27.834 --> 29:31.003
-So, Laura, tell me
how long have you
been handicapped?

29:31.103 --> 29:34.106
-I don't consider
myself handicapped.

29:34.206 --> 29:35.307
-Oh.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.877
-Laura'll kick
your ass on water skis.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.046
-That's wonderful.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.250
-Change the subject, baby.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.425
-(no audible dialogue)

30:35.267 --> 30:37.103
-Ricky!

30:37.203 --> 30:39.605
-Ricky, huh?
New boyfriend?

31:01.193 --> 31:03.329
-Hey, Merry Christmas, buddy.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.097
Hop in.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.649
Want to see why
I hate Christmas?

31:23.749 --> 31:26.953
Wife makes me
wear it every year.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.988
Would you wear
porqueria like that?

31:29.088 --> 31:31.557
Then again you
could use a little
brightening up.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.825
Christo!

31:33.960 --> 31:36.228
What happened to you, man?

31:37.096 --> 31:39.165
You get a head transplant?

32:07.359 --> 32:10.396
-(whimpers)
-You okay, sis?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.864
-Here, have some
de Monet water.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.366
It's natural carbonation.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.653
-Merry Christmas
to you too.

32:51.037 --> 32:53.372
-(suspenseful music)

32:53.472 --> 32:56.042
-Your pardon, young sir,
I was at my devotions.

32:56.142 --> 32:59.045
I did not hear you.
-I'm sorry, sir,

32:59.145 --> 33:02.281
but surely
I made enough noise
to awaken the dead.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.251
-The government of France--

33:05.351 --> 33:07.186
I've seen the uniforms

33:07.286 --> 33:10.322
of many governments
in my time.

33:10.422 --> 33:13.059
What would a soldier
of France want with him?

33:13.125 --> 33:14.626
-(phone rings)
- Shelter, for one thing.

33:14.726 --> 33:18.097
Permit me to introduce myself:
Lieutenant Andre Duvalier.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.232
-126 service.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.302
Oh, hi, Janet.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.438
I'm glad you called.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.642
I'm kind of lonesome
here all by myself.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.145
-Duvalier: I wouldn't want
to inconvenience
the French army.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.481
-I'm just watching a movie.

33:37.483 --> 33:38.784
Yeah, me too.

33:39.085 --> 33:41.453
-(bell rings)

33:41.553 --> 33:43.422
-Oh, wait. Wait a sec--
I got a customer.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.225
Hold on though.
Don't hang up.

33:46.325 --> 33:47.859
I want you to talk
dirty again to me

33:48.094 --> 33:49.561
like you did last night.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.498
Okay, okay, don't hang up.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.333
Be right back.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.604
-(chatter from television)

34:10.116 --> 34:11.650
-Merry Christmas.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.985
Can I help you?

34:14.120 --> 34:16.755
-Janet:
Hey, Greg, are you there?

34:18.190 --> 34:19.725
Come on.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.395
I want to
talk dirty to you.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.331
Greg.

34:27.666 --> 34:31.303
Okay, listen.
I know you're there.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.772
I'm thinking about you

34:33.871 --> 34:37.243
and my panties get wet
just waiting for it.

34:37.342 --> 34:40.312
(teasing)
Oh, Greg.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.850
-Duvalier!

34:47.686 --> 34:51.290
-Yes, Baron?
-Cognac for our guests.

35:34.666 --> 35:38.704
-(humming)

36:23.682 --> 36:26.518
(disappointed sigh)
That was sure dumb.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.363
-(bell rings)

37:01.620 --> 37:03.422
-Phone's gonna ring.

37:04.290 --> 37:06.392
-(phone rings)

37:09.928 --> 37:10.996
(ringing)

37:11.297 --> 37:12.564
-Hello.

37:12.664 --> 37:15.334
Oh, hi, Chris,
where are you?

37:15.434 --> 37:16.935
-You know,
people ask me all the time

37:17.035 --> 37:18.537
if I'm not
afraid of flying.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.673
The airline says
you have just as much chance
dying in a plane crash

37:21.773 --> 37:23.775
as you do being
hit by lightening.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.312
-And if they told you
pit bulls make good house pets,

37:26.378 --> 37:27.513
would you believe that too?

37:27.613 --> 37:29.781
-Your favorite
chestnut dressing.

37:29.881 --> 37:32.551
What?
(laughs)

37:32.651 --> 37:34.986
Tell Laura I made
gooseberry pie

37:35.086 --> 37:36.388
just like when
you were little.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.890
Oh, Chris, I was
gonna go out,

37:38.990 --> 37:40.692
but it's such a long
trip to the store.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.329
Could you stop
and get a couple of sticks
of butter for me?

37:43.429 --> 37:44.830
Thanks, dear.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.332
I'll see you in an hour.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.434
Drive carefully.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.666
-(dramatic music plays)

38:20.766 --> 38:23.635
-Woman (on TV):
I've waited for you so long.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.907
-(doorbell rings)

38:38.384 --> 38:39.851
-Yes?

38:44.690 --> 38:46.525
-The scene here
at county hospital

38:46.625 --> 38:48.259
is one of mass confusion

38:48.394 --> 38:50.095
in the wake of two
brutal murders.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.663
According to
Lieutenant Connely,

38:51.763 --> 38:53.499
both the hospital receptionist

38:53.599 --> 38:56.535
and an unidentified man
dressed as Santa...

38:56.635 --> 38:58.670
-(chatter through PA)

38:58.770 --> 39:01.640
-Take me through
this again, will you, Doc?

39:01.740 --> 39:04.410
You say this guy
was in a coma?

39:05.477 --> 39:07.446
-Comatose for six years, yes.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.415
-Comatose, six years.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.116
How come he's running
around killing people?

39:11.216 --> 39:15.020
-I believe that he's innocent
until proven guilty.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.422
-You do?
(chuckles)

39:16.522 --> 39:18.690
Come here.
Come on, I want to
show you something.

39:19.891 --> 39:23.294
Your, uh, coma victim,
what's his name?

39:23.429 --> 39:25.464
-Woman: Caldwell,
Richard Caldwell.

39:25.564 --> 39:29.435
-Caldwell rings a bell.
Richard Caldwell--

39:29.468 --> 39:31.437
Wait a minute,
Ricky Caldwell?

39:31.503 --> 39:33.038
That was about
six years ago.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.774
The Santa Claus Killer.
He was really cute.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.943
Chopped people up
with an ax.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.548
-She sees what he sees.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.318
-It's not the same guy.
It couldn't be.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.921
This, uh, Ricky
got iced in a shootout.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.725
-Not quite.
-I was there.

39:53.825 --> 39:56.327
We pumped a dozen rounds
into this bastard,

39:56.462 --> 39:57.996
blew half his head off.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.600
-His brain was
surgically reconstructed.

40:01.700 --> 40:05.804
We brought back some of his
basic motor functions

40:05.904 --> 40:08.774
so that his heart
and lungs could keep working.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.610
We may have even
reactivated his memory centers,

40:11.710 --> 40:15.614
but there was no way to know
as long as he was in a coma.

40:15.714 --> 40:18.984
-You jump started
his memory, Doc, is that it?

40:19.084 --> 40:21.987
-In the vernacular, yes.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.255
-Great, sounds great.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.691
I got to tell you.

40:25.791 --> 40:27.859
If you don't mind my saying,
I'd have pulled his plug.

40:27.959 --> 40:31.062
-Even his life
was of value, Lieutenant.

40:38.737 --> 40:41.673
-Now, go ahead. Eat.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.042
It's nice and hot,
good for you.

40:56.021 --> 40:57.489
There there.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.057
You don't have
to thank me.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.531
-You see...

41:06.532 --> 41:08.366
we're experimenting
with coma victims.

41:08.567 --> 41:09.801
We're trying to see

41:09.901 --> 41:12.604
if people
with psychic ability

41:12.704 --> 41:15.140
can establish
telepathic communications.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.608
-I'm sorry, Doc,

41:16.708 --> 41:19.545
but all this new-age stuff
just goes right over my head.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.913
-All right, look...
(clears throat)

41:22.013 --> 41:23.982
imagine, um--

41:24.082 --> 41:27.118
Imagine a telephone
hasn't been used in a while.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.955
We're trying to see
if we can make it ring.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.924
-Okay, now watch this.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.837
-Laura.

41:45.937 --> 41:47.272
-Hear that?

41:55.914 --> 41:58.617
-Laura.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.986
-What do you
make of that, Doc?

42:03.822 --> 42:06.457
-There's a young woman
that we use in the experiment.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.126
She's extraordinary.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.596
She doesn't even
have any idea of her powers.

42:10.696 --> 42:13.932
Her name is Laura.
-Laura, huh?

42:14.032 --> 42:18.136
And she just sort of
rang his telephone,
is that it?

42:18.236 --> 42:20.906
-She touched his soul.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.475
He's drawn to her.

42:24.610 --> 42:26.745
-She sees what he sees.

42:27.646 --> 42:29.781
But what if Ricky sees
what Laura sees.

42:31.116 --> 42:33.051
-Just got a report in
from the sheriff's office.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.486
There's a homicide
out on old Moorpark Road.

42:35.621 --> 42:37.488
They found hospital
tags on the scene.

42:37.623 --> 42:39.725
I think it just
might be our boy.

42:42.994 --> 42:46.097
-Laura who, Doc?
Where is she?

42:47.165 --> 42:48.767
-Laura Anderson.

42:48.867 --> 42:50.135
I don't know
where she is,

42:50.235 --> 42:52.638
but I'll tell you
one thing, Lieutenant.

42:52.738 --> 42:55.774
You had better find her
before he does.

43:04.883 --> 43:08.987
-(Christmas music plays)

43:49.795 --> 43:52.197
-Those are my grandchildren,
Chris and Laura.

43:52.297 --> 43:55.566
That one's Laura.
Pretty, isn't she?

43:55.701 --> 43:57.769
You know,
she's handicapped too.

43:57.869 --> 43:59.771
They're coming tonight.

43:59.871 --> 44:01.840
It's an annual tradition.

44:02.708 --> 44:04.009
I'm just checking to see

44:04.109 --> 44:07.078
if Santa
left a gift for you.

44:30.235 --> 44:33.104
-(granny screams)

44:35.506 --> 44:37.909
-Jerri: * We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

44:38.009 --> 44:39.745
* We wish you
a Merry Chris-- *
-Wait, start--

44:39.778 --> 44:41.479
I'll start low
if you start high, okay?

44:41.747 --> 44:43.248
-Okay.

44:44.315 --> 44:45.884
* We wish--
-Chris: No, I start low.

44:45.984 --> 44:48.887
You start high.
-Okay, okay, okay.

44:48.987 --> 44:51.122
Chris and Jerri:
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

44:51.222 --> 44:53.191
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

44:53.291 --> 44:57.628
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas and
a happy New Year *

44:57.763 --> 45:00.766
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

45:00.866 --> 45:02.768
* We wish you a Merry
Christmas *

45:02.868 --> 45:04.936
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

45:05.036 --> 45:07.105
* And a happy New Year

45:07.205 --> 45:10.408
-Jerri:
* Good tidings we--
(laughs)

45:30.228 --> 45:31.396
-What's wrong?

45:32.597 --> 45:34.465
-(sighs)
I guess I'm just tired.

45:36.802 --> 45:39.137
-You two go in
and I'll get the bags.

46:07.465 --> 46:09.334
-Granny?

46:38.263 --> 46:39.530
Granny!

46:58.917 --> 47:02.020
She's not here.
-You sure?

47:02.120 --> 47:03.889
-She always hears the car.

47:03.989 --> 47:06.024
She always comes out
on the porch to wait for us.

47:06.124 --> 47:09.327
-Oh, shit.
I forgot to pick up
some butter.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.997
-Something's not right.

47:13.498 --> 47:16.067
-Maybe she walked
down to the Otz's house.

47:16.902 --> 47:18.203
Unless the
Bogey Man got her.

47:18.303 --> 47:20.638
-Chris isn't gonna
let the Bogey Man get us.

47:20.906 --> 47:22.073
Are you, Chris?

47:22.173 --> 47:24.042
-Where's a telephone booth?
I have to change.

47:24.142 --> 47:26.477
-I like you just
the way you are, Clark.

47:26.577 --> 47:28.213
(giggling)

47:30.281 --> 47:33.151
-Careful you two
don't drown each other.

47:33.251 --> 47:35.420
-Chris: Laura, give it
a rest, will ya'?

47:39.925 --> 47:41.459
-There's something wrong.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.530
Chris, I'm serious.

47:45.630 --> 47:47.298
Something's wrong.

47:47.398 --> 47:49.567
-Laura, don't go
all Twilight Zone
on us, please.

47:52.938 --> 47:55.340
This chair's out of place.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.943
-That chair's always
right there by the fireplace.

47:59.010 --> 48:01.012
-How can she tell?
-We grew up in this house.

48:01.112 --> 48:02.948
She knows every
inch of it by heart.

48:03.048 --> 48:05.116
-The chair
should be here.

48:05.216 --> 48:08.253
-So the chair is moved.
What's the big deal?

48:08.353 --> 48:10.488
Come on, Jer,
I'll show you the
rest of the house.

48:34.379 --> 48:36.147
-Granny?

48:37.715 --> 48:40.185
(laughing)
Granny.

48:59.604 --> 49:02.207
-(footsteps approach)

49:05.643 --> 49:07.678
-Wow, neat old house.

49:07.778 --> 49:09.514
-Hey, Laura,
are you okay?

49:11.249 --> 49:12.317
Why don't you
start that bath?

49:12.417 --> 49:14.552
I'll check out
the food situation.

49:33.704 --> 49:36.407
-(humming)

49:37.608 --> 49:39.477
-(water running)

49:58.096 --> 49:59.697
-Happy hour.

50:15.513 --> 50:17.315
-(glass clinks)

50:18.549 --> 50:19.917
-(liquid pours)

50:20.118 --> 50:21.452
-Hey, don't be sad.

50:21.552 --> 50:23.954
-I can't help it
this time a year.

50:24.055 --> 50:25.690
It makes me think
about Mom and Dad.

50:25.790 --> 50:27.625
-Hey.

50:27.725 --> 50:30.361
To Christmases
past, present, and future.

50:39.204 --> 50:41.672
-(humming)

50:54.819 --> 50:56.621
-(dog barks)

51:06.131 --> 51:08.833
(barking)

51:12.637 --> 51:14.672
-I don't know
about this.

51:14.772 --> 51:16.374
-Just come on in.

51:18.509 --> 51:19.577
-Whoa.

51:19.677 --> 51:21.146
(sighs)

51:21.246 --> 51:22.880
Whoa.
-Too hot?

51:23.148 --> 51:24.982
-You or the water?

51:25.183 --> 51:27.285
-Mhmm, it's so nice.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.422
I don't think your sister
likes me very much.

51:31.522 --> 51:34.292
-I don't know.
It takes her a while
to warm up to people.

51:34.392 --> 51:36.527
I don't want to
talk about Laura.

51:36.627 --> 51:38.429
-Okay.

51:39.530 --> 51:42.032
-Oh, hey,
what are you doing?

51:42.167 --> 51:44.602
-(giggles)
Scrub my back.

51:48.173 --> 51:49.607
-Like that?

51:51.809 --> 51:53.178
-More like this.

51:54.279 --> 51:55.746
-You want me
to scrub your back?

51:55.846 --> 51:57.482
-Shut up.

52:12.463 --> 52:15.966
-It's just an old cop
grabbing at straws here,

52:16.201 --> 52:17.535
but, uh,

52:17.635 --> 52:20.838
if this guy's really
on her wavelength...

52:22.307 --> 52:25.410
is it possible that
wherever she's gone

52:25.510 --> 52:27.512
he's headed that way too.

52:28.913 --> 52:31.282
-She said that
she was going to
her grandmother's

52:31.382 --> 52:33.284
for the holidays.
-Uh-huh.

52:33.384 --> 52:36.354
I don't suppose you know
where grandma lives.

52:37.822 --> 52:41.226
-She mentioned something
about, uh, Piru.

52:41.326 --> 52:43.261
-Oh, that's north

52:43.361 --> 52:45.730
or could be west.

52:45.830 --> 52:49.434
It's about 50/50.
You can take your choice.

52:50.735 --> 52:53.738
You're not blowing smoke
up my ass, are you, Doc?

52:56.574 --> 53:00.378
-That sounds like
an enterprise of great pith,

53:00.478 --> 53:03.248
and moment which I would
just as soon decline.

53:05.683 --> 53:07.117
-Just asking.

53:07.252 --> 53:09.387
-She always
brings me oranges.

53:09.487 --> 53:11.722
She said something about...

53:11.822 --> 53:15.460
her grandmother having
a lot of orange trees.

53:18.796 --> 53:21.266
-(buttons clicking)
-Well, that's something anyway.

53:21.366 --> 53:24.769
(coughs) Yeah?
Connely here.

53:24.869 --> 53:26.637
I want you to go through

53:26.737 --> 53:30.040
the names of all
the orange growers
in Ventura.

53:30.275 --> 53:31.909
Look for Anderson,

53:32.009 --> 53:34.912
registered as Anderson.

53:35.913 --> 53:37.382
Yeah. Right.

53:37.482 --> 53:39.584
-(heroic music)

53:41.386 --> 53:44.722
-Wait. Wait!

53:44.822 --> 53:46.857
-Maybe we should
go look for granny
at the Otz's.

53:52.563 --> 53:54.765
-(frantic squeaking)

53:58.669 --> 54:01.005
-Come on, babe,
let's go for a walk.

54:07.412 --> 54:10.781
-(bird screeches)

54:35.005 --> 54:37.041
-There's the North Star.

54:38.643 --> 54:40.678
There's the Big Dipper.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.981
Right over there,
that's Orion.

54:46.417 --> 54:47.918
-Where's Orion?

54:49.387 --> 54:50.588
I don't see it.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.996
Come on now, baby.
Don't try to scare me.

55:02.367 --> 55:04.001
I don't like it, okay?

55:05.002 --> 55:06.036
-Ahh!

55:10.841 --> 55:11.842
-Who lives here?

55:11.942 --> 55:14.379
-Workers, people
who pick the oranges.

55:14.412 --> 55:16.881
They come and go.
-Maybe Granny's here.

55:16.981 --> 55:18.849
-I'd give it a try.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.686
-(knocking)

55:21.786 --> 55:23.854
-(dog barks)

55:27.057 --> 55:28.659
-How about that house?

55:33.030 --> 55:34.765
-Man: Gustav.

55:36.033 --> 55:37.868
-Man 2: She saved you.

55:38.903 --> 55:40.771
She loves you.

55:40.871 --> 55:42.106
You must...

55:43.441 --> 55:44.509
help...

55:44.609 --> 55:46.411
(sighs) her...

55:47.412 --> 55:48.846
tonight.

55:50.080 --> 55:52.817
Her soul cries out

55:52.917 --> 55:55.686
for release.

55:56.921 --> 55:58.656
Go back.

56:00.758 --> 56:02.727
-Nobody at the Otz's
house either.

56:02.827 --> 56:06.431
-Yeah, I forgot.
Carrie always goes down
to Baja this time of year.

56:06.497 --> 56:08.766
There's a trailer near
La Fonda.

56:10.468 --> 56:11.869
-You're worried, aren't you?

56:11.969 --> 56:12.937
I can tell.

56:13.037 --> 56:14.539
-Well, it's weird.
It's Christmas Eve

56:14.639 --> 56:15.840
and Granny's not here.

56:15.940 --> 56:18.676
My kid sister's
alone at the house.

56:19.544 --> 56:21.011
-She's hardly a kid.

56:21.111 --> 56:23.681
Anyway, what about me?

56:24.682 --> 56:26.917
-Hey, everybody's
a kid on Christmas.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.662
-Won't need those soon.

56:39.464 --> 56:41.966
-Uh, you mean, um...

56:46.236 --> 56:48.038
-We're practically
there already.

56:48.138 --> 56:49.540
-Uh-huh.

56:49.640 --> 56:53.010
-You, um--
You hooked up?

56:53.110 --> 56:55.980
I mean, with one of these?

56:57.848 --> 56:58.616
-Oh, no.

56:58.716 --> 57:01.486
I make it a rule
never to attempt

57:01.586 --> 57:04.722
two important functions
simultaneously.

57:06.023 --> 57:07.357
-That's what I said,

57:07.558 --> 57:08.859
but once you get one,

57:08.959 --> 57:11.529
you'll never know
how you did without it.

57:11.629 --> 57:14.398
You know, you got
call registry,

57:14.499 --> 57:16.501
and call waiting,
call forwarding,

57:16.601 --> 57:19.269
hundred memory
auto-dialer.

57:19.504 --> 57:21.806
You got a stick?
-A what?

57:21.906 --> 57:24.108
-Well, if you drive
a stick shift,

57:24.208 --> 57:26.143
you need the
hands-free option.

57:26.243 --> 57:27.745
That's a must.

57:32.617 --> 57:35.285
-Sounds like you have
a financial stake

57:35.520 --> 57:37.755
in these hazardous toys.

57:38.989 --> 57:42.026
-Well, I do get
100 bucks off my
cellular bill

57:42.126 --> 57:43.894
for every new sign-up.

57:46.163 --> 57:47.598
-Well, perhaps you should

57:47.698 --> 57:49.600
conserve your
zeal and vigor

57:49.700 --> 57:51.536
for the pursuit
of our lost friend.

57:51.636 --> 57:54.605
-Doc, you seem
to know your way

57:54.705 --> 57:56.674
around all
this mystical stuff,

57:56.774 --> 58:00.177
but do you know
what they call it

58:00.277 --> 58:02.246
when you get
deja vu twice?

58:03.714 --> 58:06.917
-A reoccurring
extra-sensory phenomenon.

58:08.786 --> 58:10.120
-No.

58:11.188 --> 58:12.189
Stupid.

58:14.058 --> 58:16.060
(laughs)

58:17.227 --> 58:19.830
(laughing)

58:21.165 --> 58:23.067
(laughing continues)

58:24.101 --> 58:25.903
(chuckles)

58:29.974 --> 58:32.042
-You should give
her a chance, Laura.

58:33.644 --> 58:35.212
Give me a chance.

58:36.681 --> 58:38.849
Be more tolerant
of people, okay?

58:40.785 --> 58:42.787
I know it's hard,
but nobody's perfect.

58:42.887 --> 58:45.222
You don't have
to be perfect either.

58:48.659 --> 58:50.394
I love you so much.

58:50.595 --> 58:52.296
-I'm sorry, Chris.

58:52.597 --> 58:53.964
-It's okay.

58:56.867 --> 58:59.169
-I've been
so jumpy lately.

59:00.605 --> 59:02.006
I don't know why.

59:02.106 --> 59:03.908
-That experiment?

59:04.008 --> 59:05.843
-Maybe.

59:06.744 --> 59:08.613
I just feel like

59:08.713 --> 59:10.247
that something's
pressing at me

59:10.347 --> 59:12.016
and I keep pushing it away.

59:15.319 --> 59:16.787
Does that sound crazy?

59:16.887 --> 59:18.355
-What does your shrink say?

59:18.623 --> 59:19.924
-He says it's the dis--

59:20.024 --> 59:21.692
disequal--

59:21.792 --> 59:24.261
disequilibrating phase
of my development.

59:24.361 --> 59:25.696
-What does that mean?

59:25.796 --> 59:28.633
-Heck if I know,
just plain nuts.

59:28.733 --> 59:30.467
-Yeah, well,
if you weren't a little nuts,

59:30.635 --> 59:31.836
you wouldn't be my sister.

59:31.936 --> 59:34.271
We're two peas in a pod.

59:34.371 --> 59:36.273
-Two peas in a pod...

59:38.142 --> 59:39.744
and Granny.

59:40.645 --> 59:41.646
Where is Granny?

59:41.746 --> 59:43.213
-The Otz's house
was locked up,

59:43.313 --> 59:44.849
nobody home.

59:46.651 --> 59:48.819
-We should go into town
and look for her.

59:48.919 --> 59:50.788
-Just give her
another 15 minutes.

59:50.888 --> 59:52.990
Granny won't mind
if we warm up dinner.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.224
I'm starved.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:05.870
-Did you move your car?
-No, why?

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.072
-It's not there anymore.

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:17.882
-You know, with
all your talk about
scientific theory...

01:00:19.016 --> 01:00:21.318
there's one thing you keep
leaving out of the mix,

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:24.321
a little item
called murder.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.230
-Granny.

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:36.333
-Granny!

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:41.405
-Granny!

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:57.782
-(screams)

01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:06.256
-Okay, what's going on?

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:07.691
-Oh, Chris, please!

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:10.027
-Something really
weird is happening.
We just found my car...

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:12.029
-Upside down in
the orange grove...
-Completely trashed.

01:02:12.129 --> 01:02:15.232
-Let's go.
We can walk to
the highway, please.

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:17.334
-What if Granny
needs our help?
-Why don't we call the cops?

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:19.103
-Smart.

01:02:19.203 --> 01:02:20.437
-I'll call.

01:02:27.912 --> 01:02:30.347
-(dial spins)

01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:35.352
(phone clatters)

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.388
-It's dead.
-Let me give it a try.

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:41.291
-(clicking)

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.693
-"You see, Vitius,
even the phone is dead."

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:45.195
-It's not funny, Chris!

01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:47.164
-Look, if somebody
robbed the place,

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.199
don't you think
we'd have noticed by now?

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.972
-Look.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:59.109
-My picture...

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:02.079
it's gone.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.215
-Carved him up
pretty good, huh?

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.920
-Red reactivates
his childhood trauma.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.989
-(phone rings)

01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:13.690
-Wait a minute.
That's my car.

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:15.359
-(ringing)

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:19.864
-Yeah? Hello?

01:03:19.897 --> 01:03:22.466
Damn it.
Yeah, Connely!

01:03:22.566 --> 01:03:25.202
Yeah, what you got?

01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:28.238
I'm in Piru.

01:03:32.376 --> 01:03:33.510
-(sighs)

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:38.448
Can you hear me, Ricky?

01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:43.087
You find her yet?

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.591
Your soul still searching?

01:03:52.196 --> 01:03:54.098
I should have
left you alone.

01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:57.501
I'm sorry.

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:01.105
I should have
let you sleep.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:06.911
-Okay, about 15 minutes
up the road is a farm

01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:09.013
registered with
the Orange Groves Association

01:04:09.113 --> 01:04:10.280
under the name of Anderson.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.916
Let's hope
it's the same one.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.417
Let's hope
we're not too late.

01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:18.622
-(engine starts)

01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:31.501
-It's him.

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:34.471
I know it is.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:36.240
-Chris: Who, Laura?

01:04:38.943 --> 01:04:40.644
-He was a little boy...

01:04:44.348 --> 01:04:46.050
and then--

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.454
and then
something happened...

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:53.657
something terrible.

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:55.392
-What happened?
What little boy?

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:58.062
-I saw into his mind.

01:04:59.964 --> 01:05:02.799
He was showing me
his past.

01:05:02.967 --> 01:05:04.534
-Who?
What are you talking about?

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:08.005
-I don't know
what's going on here,

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:09.506
but whatever it is--

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:12.142
(screams)
-Holy shit!

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:17.147
-It's no use.

01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:22.719
He won't be stopped.

01:05:22.987 --> 01:05:24.621
-(Ricky screams)

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:33.330
-(coughs)
-Are you okay?

01:05:34.999 --> 01:05:36.033
He almost killed her.

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:38.135
-It's not her he's after.

01:05:39.003 --> 01:05:40.204
-You know this guy, Laura?

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:42.539
-If we stay here,
he'll kills us all.

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:47.244
-So what are you
going to do when
we find him?

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.182
-Well, uh...

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:56.286
we always hope that
the guy will surrender...

01:05:58.422 --> 01:05:59.589
themselves,

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.925
but in a case like this,

01:06:02.026 --> 01:06:05.362
it's really very
difficult to tell.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.198
I'd just kind of like
to stop him before he
kills somebody else.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.533
You know what I mean?

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:13.470
-Then there's a possibility
that you'll kill him.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.541
-Well, there's always
that possibility.

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:22.646
-There's no way
that you can

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:24.514
trap him, take him alive?

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:29.186
-I suppose you'd
get all bent

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:30.387
if somebody
was to suggest

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.057
you care more about
your scientific theory

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:34.458
than you do
about innocent people.

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:37.761
-There are no
innocent people, Lieutenant.

01:06:39.063 --> 01:06:40.430
We're all guilty.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:42.932
Guilty of being stupid,

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:45.435
irrational, doomed,

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:47.437
and badly designed.

01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:51.941
No, science
is the only way

01:06:52.076 --> 01:06:54.178
to restore
our innocence.

01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:57.081
Ricky isn't a killer.

01:06:57.147 --> 01:06:59.483
He's a way to stop
people from killing...

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:03.187
like snake venom
is a way to cure the bite.

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:08.558
-Well, studying snakes

01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:09.959
is your thing, Doc.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.562
Stomping on 'em is mine.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.265
And speaking of snakes,

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:19.636
excuse me while
I relieve the reptile.

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:36.820
-(car engine starts)

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.396
-Crazy son of a bitch.

01:07:48.132 --> 01:07:49.766
-Come on, Chris, let's go.

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:53.703
Didn't he say
he was just going upstairs?

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:58.375
Look, Laura, we're
all in this together, okay?

01:08:01.145 --> 01:08:02.512
Chris?

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:04.148
Hurry.

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:13.022
Chris?

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:15.225
-(footsteps approach)

01:08:16.193 --> 01:08:17.161
-Look what I found.

01:08:17.227 --> 01:08:18.662
It's grandad's old greener,

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.365
12 gauge and shells.

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:25.001
This thing must be
100 years old.

01:08:25.169 --> 01:08:26.803
Hope these are still good.

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.654
-What's the matter?

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:21.591
Come on, Laura.

01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:29.265
-Wait.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:32.736
-What is it?
-I don't know.

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:50.354
-(screaming)

01:09:54.258 --> 01:09:57.494
-Laura: Hang on! Jerri!

01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:58.962
Jerri?

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:05.402
No!

01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:08.638
Don't!

01:10:12.276 --> 01:10:13.843
-Chris: Run!
Go back to the house!

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.279
-No, Chris!

01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:17.847
-(Laura screams)
-Go.

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:21.451
-Let's go back.
-No.

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:26.990
-(coughs)

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:05.862
-Hello, Ricky.

01:11:08.332 --> 01:11:09.799
It's Dr. Newbury.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:20.744
-(recorder clicks)
-(Laura screams)

01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:22.379
-Easy, easy, easy, easy.
-(whimpering)

01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:23.580
-All right, Laura, it's okay.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.181
It's all right,
you're just dreaming.

01:11:25.349 --> 01:11:26.716
you're just dreaming.
-(Laura's breath evens)

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:30.219
-Now, tell me.
What was it?

01:11:30.354 --> 01:11:31.955
She woke you up,
didn't she?

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:34.524
-Laura:
I dreamed I could see.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:35.992
-Newbury: That's normal.

01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:37.527
And what else?

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:41.631
-Well, nothing really.
It was just a crazy dream.

01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:44.368
-Well, that's
what you're here for,
Laura, to dream.

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.703
What kind of a dream?

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:50.707
-A dream about Christmas...

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.009
obviously because
tonight is Christmas Eve.

01:11:54.478 --> 01:11:55.945
-And what about Christmas?

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:58.214
-(Laura laughs)

01:11:58.415 --> 01:12:00.049
Santa Claus.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:02.986
-(grunts)

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:04.954
(coughs) Ricky.

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:11.795
Ricky.

01:12:13.497 --> 01:12:15.064
Ricky.

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:29.979
-Laura.

01:12:44.494 --> 01:12:46.029
-He's dead, isn't he?

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:50.166
Isn't he?

01:12:50.434 --> 01:12:51.601
-Yes.

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:57.106
-(cries)
Two peas in a pod.

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:01.044
He was all I had.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.683
-I'm sorry.

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:09.819
-(cries quietly)

01:13:11.555 --> 01:13:12.956
-I loved him too.

01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:15.459
We can't just wait here
for this maniac

01:13:15.559 --> 01:13:16.292
to come get us.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:19.929
(screams)

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:30.039
-There's another gun.

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:31.508
My grandfather's army pistol,

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:32.976
it's under one of the beds.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:34.744
Maybe this one.

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:37.046
It must be the other.

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:39.683
-Stay here, I'll go get it.
-No! Jerri--

01:13:39.783 --> 01:13:41.618
-Shh, I'll be right back,
I promise.

01:13:41.718 --> 01:13:43.720
-Jerri.
-Yeah?

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.089
-I'm sorry
I was mean to you.

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:19.756
-(screams)

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:00.830
-Jerri?

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.715
I can feel you here.

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:23.687
Jerri.

01:15:25.589 --> 01:15:26.890
(gasps)

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.092
(cries)

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:57.253
-Laura.

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:26.249
-(screams)

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:30.920
-(lock clicks)

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:37.927
-(heavy breathing)

01:18:27.971 --> 01:18:29.906
-(rat squeaks)
-(screams)

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:31.407
-(clanging, clattering)

01:18:43.019 --> 01:18:44.120
-(Grandma echoing) Laura.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.388
-No.

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:47.290
-Laura, listen to me, dear.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.293
-No.

01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:51.795
-Are you listening?

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:54.597
You must listen
to me, Laura.

01:18:54.798 --> 01:18:57.333
You have the power.

01:18:57.433 --> 01:18:59.202
It is a gift.

01:18:59.302 --> 01:19:00.703
You must accept it.

01:19:00.804 --> 01:19:02.371
Learn how to use it.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.074
-I'm scared, Granny.

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:08.111
-Don't be frightened, child.

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:09.946
Use your power.

01:19:10.046 --> 01:19:12.982
Use it to do
good for people.

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:16.920
Use it for your life
and the lives of others.

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:20.389
-But I don't know
what to do, Granny.

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:21.858
Please help me.

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:23.827
-Concentrate, Laura.

01:19:23.927 --> 01:19:26.329
Use your mind
like a lens

01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:27.864
to gather the light

01:19:27.964 --> 01:19:30.934
to shine on darkness
where you cannot see.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:34.737
Use your power, child.

01:19:34.838 --> 01:19:37.907
No one can hurt you
if you use the power.

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:40.443
-Granny?

01:19:42.378 --> 01:19:43.746
Granny, you're here.

01:19:43.847 --> 01:19:46.215
I can feel you near me.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.189
Granny.

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:57.193
Granny!

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:59.362
Granny, please
don't leave me.

01:20:01.097 --> 01:20:02.966
Please don't leave me!

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.534
Help me!

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.672
Help.

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:12.508
(screams)

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.815
-(footsteps approach)

01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:51.547
-Now we're even.

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:32.321
(whimpers)

01:21:56.312 --> 01:21:57.981
-Chris:
Hey, bubble head!

01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:01.650
-(gun clicks)

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:04.220
-Is it live or
is it Memorex?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.701
-(gunshot)

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:38.221
-(gun clicks)

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:40.723
-Chris!

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:53.436
-(strangled coughs)

01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:00.143
(coughing)

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:15.691
-I'm over here, Ricky.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.527
Come and play.

01:23:53.129 --> 01:23:55.698
(sniffling)

01:24:03.839 --> 01:24:06.109
-(siren wails)

01:24:36.139 --> 01:24:38.341
-Give me a call
some time, Doc.

01:24:43.179 --> 01:24:44.780
-Lieutenant.

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:47.683
Don't...

01:24:47.783 --> 01:24:50.753
be stupid.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.958
(shaky breathing)

01:24:56.159 --> 01:24:57.726
(shivering)

01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:23.519
-I love you, Chris.

01:25:48.277 --> 01:25:50.513
-(police radio chatter)

01:26:14.703 --> 01:26:17.240
-Call ahead to intensive care
to set up life support.

01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:18.874
With a little luck,
we can save this guy.

01:26:23.979 --> 01:26:27.850
-(siren wails)

01:26:35.624 --> 01:26:38.661
-Um, how you doing?
Are you okay?

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:43.632
-I'll be fine. Thanks.

01:27:03.452 --> 01:27:05.588
-I don't know
how you did it.

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:10.526
I guess there's a lot of things
that I don't know.

01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:22.805
-Merry Christmas.

01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:26.442
-(car engine starts)

01:27:53.936 --> 01:27:57.940
-And a happy New Year.

01:28:07.416 --> 01:28:10.586
-(music plays)
