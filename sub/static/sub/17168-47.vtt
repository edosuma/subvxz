I think spirit animals

to spent thousands of dollars
just to learn things

09:52.759 --> 09:54.025
they could figure out
for free.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.527
Leave them with an
amount of debt

09:55.529 --> 09:57.796
and a useless piece of paper
that reads, "Diploma."

09:57.798 --> 10:00.532
They're pedaling a dream
that doesn't exist anymore.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.233
The bears are doing this?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.536
That's right. We don't need
to learn nothing!

10:04.538 --> 10:05.904
As a man.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.940
Whoo!
Look at those pits.
