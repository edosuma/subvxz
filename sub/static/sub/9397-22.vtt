00:51.760 --> 00:54.957
- How long you been out here?
- A couple hours.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.640
Sometimes, I come out here
when I can't sleep.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.958
- You miss it?
- Every day.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.149
- So what's up?
- I had this messed up dream last night.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.348
Haley was drowning,
and I couldn't save her.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.839
Of course, leave it to Haley to insist

01:18.920 --> 01:22.469
that we don't see each other until
the wedding, even though we're married.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.278
Maybe I should just go see her.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.834
I'll tell you what,
I'll go check on her for you, how's that?

01:28.920 --> 01:30.672
Well, tell her to stay away
from the water, okay?

01:30.760 --> 01:32.591
No swimming or anything.

01:32.680 --> 01:36.639
Nathan, it's your wedding day. Again.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.238
- It's gonna be a great day.
- Thanks.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.915
You're closer than 100 feet.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.476
Just paying my respects.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.752
You know, everyone thinks of Keith
as this perfect guy,

02:07.080 --> 02:09.752
- but they're wrong.
- No, they're not, Dan.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.913
Keith is a hero.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.313
He tried to kill me.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.594
That's right.

02:23.040 --> 02:26.157
He's the one who tried to burn me
in the dealership fire.

02:30.840 --> 02:34.196
So I guess the hero got
what was coming to him, after all.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.674
Knock, knock!

02:44.240 --> 02:46.231
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.833
- How is the bride-to-be?
- Oh, good.

02:49.920 --> 02:50.909
Good.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.515
Well, I'm afraid you've missed the boys.
They were gone pretty early.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.353
Oh, that's okay.
I wanted to see you, actually.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.109
- I have a question for you.
- Okay.

03:06.280 --> 03:11.149
Okay, Brooke made me

03:08.840 --> 03:11.912
this dress, and it is out of the material

03:14.520 --> 03:16.636
that she ordered for your wedding dress,

03:17.680 --> 03:19.830
and I just wanted to ask you
if it was okay if I wore it.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.519
And if it's not, that's fine,
she made another one that I can wear...

03:22.120 --> 03:25.749
I'm so proud of you, Haley.
Have I told you that lately?

03:24.840 --> 03:28.310
You have got a wonderful soul,
Haley James Scott,

03:30.040 --> 03:32.998
and you're gonna make
a beautiful bride in that dress.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.913
Thank you.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.555
Hi.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.235
- Where'd you sleep?
- My car.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.752
See, I had this horrible dream last night,

03:54.320 --> 03:58.711
that my best friend told me
she had feelings for my boyfriend.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.356
But that wasn't a dream, was it?

04:03.920 --> 04:05.672
- Brooke...
- Why now, Peyton?

04:10.120 --> 04:12.634
Why would you tell me
you have feelings for Lucas, now?

04:12.320 --> 04:15.312
When I have so much going on in my life,
stuff that you don't even know about!

04:14.920 --> 04:17.559
Well, so do I, okay? Trust me.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.991
But I didn't wish for this, all right?
I wished for Jake.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.830
Oh, right. You wished for Jake.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.195
After you wished for Pete, and then Lucas.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.036
I cannot believe this is happening again.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.478
It's not, okay? It's not, it's just...
Okay, the last time...

04:33.800 --> 04:37.110
The last time?
Do you hear yourself right now?

04:36.680 --> 04:39.797
The last time you tried
to steal my boyfriend?

04:40.080 --> 04:44.278
He's on the door, Peyton.
He's on the damn door under me!

04:43.280 --> 04:46.955
- I don't wanna steal him, okay?
- But you like him.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.990
Brooke, I'm not gonna
do anything about it, okay?

04:57.280 --> 04:59.236
- I'll just bury it!
- You can't.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.351
Okay? It's out. It's like the time capsule.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.676
And you could've buried it
and not said anything to me.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.675
- So what is that about?
- I don't know, all right?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.716
I just... I wanted to be honest with you.
All right?

05:07.960 --> 05:10.030
I don't wanna make
the same mistake I did last time.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.957
And you know what?
You even said last night at Tric,

05:12.240 --> 05:13.798
that you really didn't miss him!

05:14.200 --> 05:15.758
Don't you dare!

05:17.240 --> 05:19.834
Don't you dare twist my words around
to make yourself feel

05:18.880 --> 05:22.350
like you are not a backstabbing,
two-faced bitch, Peyton, because you are,

05:21.560 --> 05:23.357
- Hey, pretty girl.
- Hey.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.951
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.954
Come on.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.835
Nobody loves a wedding
more than Brooke Davis. What's up?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.433
I'd just appreciate it
if you wouldn't talk to Peyton today.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.116
You're kidding, right?

05:51.440 --> 05:53.829
This is a wedding.
We're all in the same wedding party.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.633
We're all friends here, Brooke.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.718
You know,
could you do me a favor, just once,

05:59.480 --> 06:03.075
and put me above your precious Peyton,
and do something that I ask you to do?

06:00.920 --> 06:02.751
- Thanks.
- Whoa. What happened?

06:02.720 --> 06:06.872
And I'm stressed out about my speech,
and Haley's dress, and I'm late.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.710
I'm late to get ready, and I'm sorry.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.719
Come here.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.679
It's okay.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.474
You look nice.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.068
Weddings.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.229
Rachel.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.679
- You look almost as hot as me.
- Listen to me,

06:39.560 --> 06:41.039
you gotta stop calling me.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.591
I told you we couldn't
see each other anymore.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.317
And before you left that morning,
I think I made myself perfectly clear.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.151
Yeah, but the night before that,
you weren't so clear.

07:17.480 --> 07:21.155
In fact, if I remember right,
I think you weren't so clear three times.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.630
- You're 17.
- Yeah.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.197
And I was 17 that night, too.
And all the other nights.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.919
Okay, listen to me. I'm sorry. Okay?
I made a mistake.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.995
But this is Nathan and Haley's day.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.719
Now, I promise you
we'll talk about this later,

07:36.120 --> 07:38.475
but do not make this ugly for them.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.952
I wouldn't think of it.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.915
Need a hand?

07:45.600 --> 07:47.397
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.079
It's just a tie, Lucas. Come on, let me see.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.349
So, how's life without basketball?

08:04.840 --> 08:06.956
It's better than life without Keith.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.353
Okay, let's see.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.795
Dan thinks it was Keith.

08:19.200 --> 08:23.751
The fire. I just found out this morning.
I'm sorry, Karen.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.958
It's not fair to Keith's memory.
It's not fair to you.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.950
Yes, it's not fair to Keith.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.433
But Dan's need for revenge
was buried with his brother.

08:43.559 --> 08:46.632
He's not gonna be coming after you,
or anybody else.

08:49.040 --> 08:53.591
Maybe so, but in a way,
that makes me feel weaker than ever.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.075
<i>Nathan!</i>

08:56.640 --> 08:59.757
- Nathan. You okay?
- Yeah.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.597
- Have you checked on Haley?
- Yeah. She's fine.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.070
'Cause she should be here by now.
Can you call her?

09:20.840 --> 09:22.353
- Nate...
- Please!

09:24.040 --> 09:26.554
- Just do it.
- Okay. All right. All right.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.911
Hey. Haley, you all right?

09:28.080 --> 09:31.390
- Something's wrong, man.
<i>- Hey. What's up?</i>

09:29.680 --> 09:31.716
Hey, it's me. Is everything okay?

09:38.240 --> 09:41.073
<i>Fine, soon-to-be-husband-again. Why?</i>

09:40.800 --> 09:43.997
I just... I just wanted to hear your voice,
that's all.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.995
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm right here.</i>

09:50.160 --> 09:53.948
Oh, I'm sorry, princess.
I was looking for my friend Haley.

09:53.240 --> 09:55.754
Wow, did it really take all this stuff
to make you look like this?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.990
No! Everybody got ready in here,

10:25.200 --> 10:27.077
including Rachel and Brooke,
for some reason.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.188
- Hi.
- All right.

10:32.560 --> 10:37.475
- Wow. You really look beautiful.
- Thank you.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.711
So your parents really aren't coming?

10:36.840 --> 10:39.912
No, they... I invited them, and they said,

10:39.600 --> 10:41.477
"Sorry, honey, we've been
to your wedding once before,

10:44.960 --> 10:46.871
"and it was a little boring."

10:46.880 --> 10:49.758
Anyway, I'll just give myself away,
that's fine.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.473
Or I could do it.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.353
If you'll have me.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.676
- Really? Luke, that would be perfect.
- Okay.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.199
Thank you.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.440
But you know what,
I gotta be honest with you.

11:05.280 --> 11:08.795
I could never officially give you away,
you know that?

11:10.680 --> 11:13.069
I could never give away my best friend.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.994
Congrats.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.394
Hey, Rachel.
You look almost as hot as me.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.832
Sounds like something I would say.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.548
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hi.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.516
How about we go find you
a good seat, friend?

11:35.640 --> 11:36.959
Hey, you.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.149
So, I've been informed
to avoid you like the plague.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.957
- What's up?
- Nothing. Just...

11:49.880 --> 11:51.552
Look, if Brooke doesn't
want you to talk to me,

11:52.240 --> 11:53.878
just do it. I'll be fine.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.868
Hey, Peyton.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.914
You look nice.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.473
- Feeling sentimental, Deb?
- Feeling nauseous, actually.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.757
You had your chance.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.510
Wanna make it a dual ceremony, Coop?

12:39.560 --> 12:42.074
Now I know how this dress
looks on a witch.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.192
Go Brooke yourself.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.472
Friends and loved ones,

13:02.240 --> 13:05.915
we are gathered here today
to witness the renewal of a commitment,

13:04.960 --> 13:07.428
a commitment between Nathan and Haley,

13:42.840 --> 13:46.594
to love one another
unconditionally and endlessly.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.318
Nathan and Haley,

13:48.520 --> 13:51.512
there are many things
I could say to the two of you today,

13:51.160 --> 13:54.994
but instead I choose to listen
to the words you have for each other.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.149
Haley?

13:58.200 --> 14:02.034
Nathan, it's been said that
there's one word that will free us

14:01.280 --> 14:05.034
from the weight and the pain of life,
and that word is love.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.038
And I believe that.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.356
That doesn't mean that
it hasn't been hard, or that it won't be,

14:11.840 --> 14:16.550
it just means that I've found a stillness

14:17.280 --> 14:19.953
and bravery in myself, with you.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.752
You make me brave.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.156
And I will love you until the end of time.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.952
This I vow today.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.513
Nathan?

14:34.840 --> 14:38.515
Last year we stood on a beach,
and I told you how much I loved you

14:39.680 --> 14:42.877
and how I would always,
always protect you.

14:43.320 --> 14:46.357
That day,
nobody believed that this would work.

14:46.720 --> 14:50.998
But I don't think anybody understood
the love that I had for you,

14:50.560 --> 14:53.870
because if they did,
they would have never doubted us.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.872
So, I wanted to marry you all over again,
in front of most of our world,

14:58.040 --> 15:00.508
because today, when I look into your eyes,

15:03.720 --> 15:05.517
my love for you only grows.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.632
It's even stronger now.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.510
And our love will never waver.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.880
This I vow to you, today,

15:20.200 --> 15:22.839
and always, and forever.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.799
Haley, on this day,

15:25.800 --> 15:30.191
do you reconfirm and rededicate yourself
to the vows you promised to uphold?

15:29.120 --> 15:31.315
Oh. Thank you.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.508
I do.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.755
Nathan, on this day,

15:43.760 --> 15:46.832
do you rededicate and reconfirm
your commitment

15:46.240 --> 15:49.755
- to the vows you promised to uphold?
- I do.

15:50.920 --> 15:54.276
And, actually, I have a new ring.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.839
Thank you.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.556
And now, before the eyes of God,

16:01.320 --> 16:04.551
I once again pronounce you
husband and wife.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.394
You may kiss your bride.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.991
- I love you, Haley.
- I love you, too.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.192
You know, one day
we'll walk down the aisle again, Deb.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.673
- You'll see.
- Open your eyes, Dan.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.238
I don't love you,
I'm not coming back to you,

16:56.640 --> 16:59.871
and Keith didn't try to kill you, I did.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.074
Danny.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.556
How's your life, little brother?

17:07.119 --> 17:09.349
I'm Cooper, by the way.
You're Michelle Featherstone, right?

17:29.080 --> 17:31.116
- Yes.
- That song you played was perfect.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.077
- In fact, I think all your stuff's really great.
- Thank you. Thank you.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.559
- I think all of your stuff is pretty great, too.
- Well, thank you.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.114
Hey, Rach.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.713
You gonna talk to me? Please?

18:02.080 --> 18:03.069
Fine.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.918
So this is how it ends,

18:25.360 --> 18:28.909
a 10-year friendship
that survived two dead moms,

18:31.440 --> 18:33.032
three absentee parents,

18:32.680 --> 18:35.194
shoplifting, jail time,

18:34.800 --> 18:39.032
- and we can't survive one boy?
- Not "one boy," Peyton,

18:39.080 --> 18:40.308
my boy.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.598
And he still is your boy. I told you that.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.359
Do you love him?

18:50.840 --> 18:52.751
You are something else.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.311
How dare you be so selfish
to ask me that about my boyfriend?

18:57.800 --> 19:01.839
How dare I? Okay, you know what, Brooke,
I didn't want it this way.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.433
Okay, I tried tears, all right?

19:03.160 --> 19:06.232
I tried apologizing to you. I cried.
And you know what you did?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.868
You slapped me, and you blew me off.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.637
Yeah, and you're gonna be lucky
if next time I don't use my fist.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.317
I can't believe you're supposed to be
the maid of honor.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.796
None of those words were,
"Yes, Peyton. I love him."

19:19.000 --> 19:20.115
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

19:22.200 --> 19:24.953
<i>please stand and join me</i>
<i>in welcoming Nathan and Haley.</i>

19:26.040 --> 19:27.837
<i>Husband and wife, again.</i>

19:27.480 --> 19:30.790
<i>And now, the song they picked</i>
<i>for their first dance.</i>

19:35.920 --> 19:38.150
What song did you pick, anyway?

19:37.120 --> 19:40.795
- Oh, I was hoping it would be this one.
- I had a little help.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.837
So are you gonna tell me
what this is about?

19:50.080 --> 19:53.914
- Maybe you should tell me about it.
- Well, what's that supposed to mean?

19:54.640 --> 19:57.791
Peyton told me some things
about the two of you.

19:58.720 --> 20:01.109
Look, Brooke, I know

21:17.200 --> 21:19.430
that you're worried about
my past with Peyton,

21:19.160 --> 21:22.197
but you have to understand
the circumstances this time, you know?

21:23.800 --> 21:27.554
I mean, God, she was bleeding,
and she thought she was gonna die.

21:27.640 --> 21:30.359
I mean, the kiss, it meant nothing.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.993
What kiss?

21:32.880 --> 21:34.871
Did you kiss her again?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.878
Look, Brooke, I need you to listen to me.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.673
Okay, I understand that
you didn't know about the kiss,

21:44.360 --> 21:47.591
and I'm sorry for springing it on you,
but I meant what I said.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.156
It didn't mean anything.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.428
A kiss always means something.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.834
Okay, well, maybe you're right,
but it wasn't a romantic moment.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.195
- And you would know that if...
- lf what, I was there?

22:28.160 --> 22:30.071
As you so sweetly pointed out
at the party,

22:30.200 --> 22:33.317
the party that I threw for you,
I wasn't there, was I?

22:32.760 --> 22:36.548
Is it impossible for you to forgive me?

22:36.600 --> 22:39.512
- I forgave you.
- For what?

22:39.040 --> 22:41.190
For sleeping with Chris Keller.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.634
And you know what, Lucas?
I loved you for that.

22:50.160 --> 22:54.517
You had such grace in that moment,

22:55.040 --> 22:58.077
that I fell in love with you all over again.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.432
I can't believe that you would
use it now as a bargaining chip.

23:05.200 --> 23:09.159
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
I just... I need you to trust me,

23:08.320 --> 23:11.437
and believe me when I tell you
that my heart is with you.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.911
But a part of me feels like
ever since we got back together,

23:17.200 --> 23:20.272
you've just been waiting,
waiting to push me away.

23:20.360 --> 23:23.636
Oh, great. You kiss Peyton again,

23:24.400 --> 23:26.311
and I'm pushing you away!

23:28.640 --> 23:32.076
God, why did I make everybody
identical purses as wedding gifts?

23:31.880 --> 23:33.871
I love you, Brooke.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.874
- I don't know how else to say it.
- How about how you show it?

23:38.400 --> 23:42.279
I am not pushing you away, Lucas.
I am holding on for dear life,

23:42.480 --> 23:44.914
but I need you to need me back.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.959
Okay, why wouldn't you tell me
about the kiss?

23:53.200 --> 23:55.953
And why didn't you call me
while you were away?

23:57.440 --> 24:00.876
And why won't you ever
just let me all the way in?

24:01.400 --> 24:03.834
We have to go and give our toasts now,

24:04.120 --> 24:05.519
about love.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.637
Please don't be mad, Brooke.

24:09.680 --> 24:13.116
I'm not mad, Lucas. I'm not mad.

24:20.720 --> 24:24.269
<i>The last time I gave a speech</i>
<i>about Nathan and Haley was,</i>

24:24.840 --> 24:26.751
<i>well, at their first reception.</i>

24:29.160 --> 24:32.470
<i>And I remember saying,</i>
<i>"Prepare to be surprised."</i>

24:32.680 --> 24:35.513
<i>Well, I have to say, even I was surprised.</i>

24:48.720 --> 24:52.872
<i>Because, you see,</i>
<i>they do something that's very rare</i>

24:52.400 --> 24:53.992
<i>to see in someone our age.</i>

24:55.240 --> 24:58.710
<i>Actually, it's very rare to see in anybody.</i>

24:59.360 --> 25:02.830
<i>They give their hearts</i>
<i>to each other, unconditionally.</i>

25:02.720 --> 25:05.234
<i>And that's what true love really is.</i>

25:07.240 --> 25:11.631
<i>It's not this fairy-tale life</i>
<i>that never knows pain,</i>

25:08.920 --> 25:12.230
<i>but it's two souls facing it together,</i>

25:13.280 --> 25:16.192
<i>and diminishing it with unconditional love.</i>

25:19.600 --> 25:22.068
<i>To Nathan and Haley Scott.</i>

25:22.400 --> 25:24.914
<i>I'm not the most eloquent speaker,</i>

25:26.960 --> 25:31.909
<i>so I thought I would borrow</i>
<i>a few words from Shakespeare.</i>

25:31.400 --> 25:35.996
<i>"Love is not love</i>
<i>Which alters when it alteration finds. "</i>

25:36.040 --> 25:39.430
<i>When life gets hard, when things change,</i>

25:52.800 --> 25:54.597
<i>true love remains the same.</i>

25:55.400 --> 25:59.439
<i>I look at Nathan and Haley</i>
<i>and somehow I feel safer.</i>

26:02.200 --> 26:04.589
<i>I don't know if I can explain that,</i>

26:07.960 --> 26:09.598
<i>but they give me hope.</i>

26:11.960 --> 26:15.555
<i>And I'm afraid to say it out loud,</i>
<i>because maybe if life finds out,</i>

26:15.520 --> 26:18.080
<i>it'll try to beat it out of them.</i>

26:20.640 --> 26:22.551
<i>And that would be a shame,</i>

26:23.600 --> 26:26.751
<i>because we all can use</i>
<i>a little hope sometimes, you know?</i>

26:26.120 --> 26:29.669
<i>That feeling that everything</i>
<i>is gonna be okay,</i>

26:29.800 --> 26:33.349
<i>and that there's gonna be someone there</i>
<i>to help make sure of that.</i>

26:32.440 --> 26:35.000
<i>So here's to Nathan and Haley.</i>

26:34.440 --> 26:35.793
<i>Here's to hope.</i>

26:38.400 --> 26:41.312
<i>And here's to a love that will not alter.</i>

26:43.040 --> 26:46.350
I never apologized for the way
I treated you and Lucas,

26:47.280 --> 26:49.555
or for the way I treated Keith.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.436
I suppose it's too late.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.353
I'm pregnant.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.559
I'm gonna be there for you
this time, Karen.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.958
It's gonna be okay.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.798
<i>Hi. Excuse me,</i>
<i>I'd like your attention for a second.</i>

27:28.840 --> 27:30.592
<i>I'd like to propose a toast</i>

27:41.600 --> 27:45.229
<i>to my knucklehead of a nephew</i>
<i>and his beautiful bride.</i>

27:45.480 --> 27:46.754
Here we go.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.398
<i>As most of you know,</i>
<i>Nathan and Haley's relationship</i>

27:52.480 --> 27:55.313
<i>was unexpected,</i>

27:54.560 --> 27:58.155
<i>mostly because Haley</i>
<i>is classy and attractive,</i>

27:58.320 --> 28:00.675
<i>and Nathan is not.</i>

27:59.680 --> 28:04.151
<i>But here's to Nathan and Haley,</i>
<i>for proving to us that love is real,</i>

28:02.720 --> 28:05.109
<i>and genuine, and still attainable</i>
<i>for the rest of us.</i>

28:06.160 --> 28:07.434
<i>Cheers, you two.</i>

28:10.320 --> 28:12.151
Thanks, Coop, I guess.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.509
Love you, man.

28:19.920 --> 28:23.708
<i>Well, well. I would like to make a toast</i>

28:22.400 --> 28:25.949
<i>to Cooper's toast, about love.</i>

28:28.240 --> 28:29.673
<i>But wait a minute.</i>

28:30.160 --> 28:33.914
<i>What could Nathan and Haley</i>
<i>possibly know about love?</i>

28:35.080 --> 28:38.470
<i>I mean, they're only 17, right?</i>
<i>Right, Cooper?</i>

28:40.120 --> 28:42.793
<i>You see, Cooper seems to think</i>

28:45.080 --> 28:49.039
<i>a 17-year-old couldn't possibly</i>
<i>know anything about love.</i>

28:47.040 --> 28:50.669
<i>Of course, you know, that didn't stop him</i>
<i>from having sex with me, right?</i>

28:50.880 --> 28:51.915
Rachel.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.398
<i>Yeah. To sex with Cooper!</i>

28:57.200 --> 29:00.715
- Is she serious?
- I'm so sorry. I'll be right back. Excuse me.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.079
Hey, Rachel, come on!

29:06.320 --> 29:09.676
Rachel! No, no, no! Hey, bad idea!

29:08.600 --> 29:09.635
Hey!

29:15.640 --> 29:18.518
Rachel, stop the car.
Damn it, Rachel, stop the car!

29:28.200 --> 29:30.839
You trying to kill me?
What is your problem?

29:31.960 --> 29:34.997
First, you ruin the reception, you steal
the limousine, and you drive drunk!

29:36.680 --> 29:40.116
- Are you out of your mind?
- I must be, to fall in love with you!

29:39.200 --> 29:40.679
Look, I'm sorry, Rachel, okay?

29:54.400 --> 29:56.072
I made a mistake when we slept together,

29:57.120 --> 29:59.759
and it wasn't just because you're 17.

30:00.240 --> 30:04.119
Hell, even when I thought you were older,
I wasn't looking to get serious.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.469
I'm sorry, I mean, that sounds harsh,

30:09.640 --> 30:12.837
but you even said,
"We're just having fun, Coop." Remember?

30:11.400 --> 30:12.674
I lied.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.633
I'm so stupid.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.152
Hey, don't... Don't do that.

30:20.560 --> 30:24.599
- I thought you liked me.
- I did, Rachel. I liked you.

30:23.920 --> 30:24.989
Right.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.074
"Liked."

30:32.000 --> 30:34.230
Look, let me take you home. Okay?

30:38.200 --> 30:40.919
No. I left all my stuff at the reception.
My purse, my keys...

30:42.840 --> 30:44.239
That's fine. That's great, you know what?

30:45.640 --> 30:47.676
We'll take the limousine
back to the reception,

30:50.760 --> 30:53.354
and we'll pretend like
none of this ever happened.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.839
All right?

30:57.320 --> 30:58.389
Let's go.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.473
So, there was a slight mix-up.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.797
- Sweet. I'm driving.
- No way!

31:03.600 --> 31:06.353
- Hey, we'll leave the car at the airport.
- All right.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.996
We're going to London for a few days.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.836
Why? Doesn't it always rain there?

31:28.760 --> 31:31.194
- Oh, yeah. You in?
- Yeah.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.398
Thank you, guys, for coming. We love you!

31:34.280 --> 31:35.395
Hey, buddy.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.198
It looks like Rachel
took the limo with Cooper.

31:38.640 --> 31:42.599
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Me, too.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.960
I guess we never finished
that conversation.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.193
Dance with me.

32:10.880 --> 32:14.395
- Didn't you miss me while you were away?
- Every day.

32:15.240 --> 32:18.312
I was just angry

32:30.520 --> 32:33.034
and upset about Keith,
and I just needed to be alone,

32:35.880 --> 32:38.792
but that doesn't mean
that I didn't miss you, Brooke,

32:56.880 --> 32:58.313
because I did.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.557
I needed to hear your voice.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.354
There's just so much stuff
going on with me.

33:07.440 --> 33:08.998
What kind of stuff?

33:11.640 --> 33:13.358
I just got that feeling,

33:14.880 --> 33:17.394
that stillness I used to feel before dawn,

33:18.840 --> 33:21.354
that feeling that
the world could be perfect.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.039
Yeah, I feel it, too.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.876
Don't say I never gave you anything.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.438
Then there were two.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.840
Sorry about today, and all the drama.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.279
Peyton?

34:05.400 --> 34:08.152
I accidentally told Brooke
about the library,

34:14.159 --> 34:15.478
the kiss.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.716
- Luke?
- Hi.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.554
Are you going home with Brooke,
or with me?

34:23.159 --> 34:25.833
With you. Brooke left.

34:26.199 --> 34:27.518
I'm sorry.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.833
- You and Brooke okay?
- Yeah.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.395
She's just going through some stuff.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.440
Well, listen, could you grab
my wrap and my purse?

34:43.960 --> 34:45.632
Yeah, sure. I'll drive.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.195
Hey, Ma?

35:04.000 --> 35:07.037
Are you pregnant?

35:06.600 --> 35:07.953
Yes, I am.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.196
That's not my purse.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.068
Oh, you know,
maybe Brooke took the wrong...

35:27.680 --> 35:28.999
Brooke?

35:34.520 --> 35:37.432
Brooke, don't go, please.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.636
I don't want to, but I have to.

35:46.640 --> 35:50.952
Okay, all right, look. Just stop, all right?
What do I have to do to fix this?

35:54.120 --> 35:58.352
Brooke, I'll do anything.
Just... I don't want you to go.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.877
You know, you asked me
earlier today if I love Lucas,

36:04.680 --> 36:06.477
and I have your answer.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.028
But you don't deserve to hear it.

36:12.480 --> 36:13.993
- Brooke.
- No.

36:19.240 --> 36:21.549
I want you to understand something.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.433
As far as I'm concerned,
this friendship is over.

36:26.080 --> 36:30.392
And if we never speak again
for the rest of our lives, that'll be fine.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.799
I gave you a second chance, Peyton,

36:30.720 --> 36:32.438
and you blew it.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.759
Is there anything I can say
to keep you, Cooper?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.675
No, sorry, Rachel, there's not.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.039
That's too bad,

36:57.800 --> 37:00.314
because there's something
I have to tell you.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.712
Oh, I left my purse!

37:18.920 --> 37:21.309
It's got everything in it,
the plane tickets, everything.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.389
We have to go back.

37:30.440 --> 37:33.796
No, hold on,
it's okay, I'll just have Lucas meet us.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.073
Hey, Luke.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.951
Hey, man, Haley left her purse
and a bunch of stuff at the reception,

37:51.280 --> 37:53.350
- could you bring that to us?
- It's in the anteroom.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.509
Oh. Oh, okay.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.595
All right, well, we're coming up
on the Molina Bridge right now,

37:57.840 --> 38:00.229
so, I guess we'll just pull over
and wait for you.

38:01.080 --> 38:03.913
All right. Thanks, man. Bye. Done.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.356
He already had the purse in his car.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.313
- You're good in a crisis.
- I don't know about that.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.398
No, you are.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.038
Good thing, too,

38:12.320 --> 38:15.437
especially since I have something
I have to tell you.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.519
I don't believe you.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.711
- Pull over.
- Hell, no.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.675
I'm not letting you out
until we talk about this.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.478
- I said, pull over!
- No!

38:32.200 --> 38:33.952
- We're gonna talk about this...
- I said, pull over!

38:36.040 --> 38:37.712
I'm not pulling the car...

38:38.120 --> 38:39.758
What are you doing?

38:40.560 --> 38:41.834
Look out!

38:42.280 --> 38:45.556
- That was Cooper. Cooper!
- Cooper!

38:44.120 --> 38:46.793
- Haley, call 911.
- Nathan, don't.

38:46.480 --> 38:47.708
I love you.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.468
Nathan!

39:36.760 --> 39:37.875
Nathan!

39:40.880 --> 39:42.279
Nathan, don't!

39:45.960 --> 39:48.315
Nathan! Cooper!

39:48.440 --> 39:50.476
Anybody, please help!

39:53.200 --> 39:54.428
