00:09.200 --> 00:11.040
[Sophie panting]

00:13.800 --> 00:15.760
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:15.840 --> 00:18.320
-Maybe it was a deer.
-We killed Bambi?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.600
-It was Enzo!
-We killed Enzo?

00:20.680 --> 00:23.240
We're all going to jail.
It's all over for us.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.080
-Goodbye, Harvard.
-[Sophie whispers] Oh, my God.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.200
Emma?

00:33.560 --> 00:36.960
Guys, it was just a deer.
It's not even dead. It just ran away.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.960
-[Sophie] No, no, no, no.
-But what if he was a she,

00:39.040 --> 00:40.320
and ran away to die?

00:41.040 --> 00:41.920
We killed Bambi's mom?

00:42.680 --> 00:43.960
[all scream]

00:45.080 --> 00:46.000
Not Bambi's mom.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.080
[theme music playing]

01:08.520 --> 01:10.519
Oh, my God. Thank you for being alive.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.240
Sophie, no!

01:12.320 --> 01:14.800
-What the hell are you doing?
-[Enzo] Ow! Jesus!

01:14.880 --> 01:16.200
You're the one who ran into me!

01:16.280 --> 01:17.640
Technically, you ran into us.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.120
-We really should call an ambulance.
-No! [groans]

01:20.200 --> 01:23.120
No. No ambulance.
Nobody can know about this.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.440
Of course not, Enzo. What is it this time?
Huh? Look at me!

01:26.520 --> 01:28.080
-What?
-Is it gambling debt?

01:28.840 --> 01:30.440
Whose car is that?

01:32.800 --> 01:34.640
I don't think you need
to worry about him anymore.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.840
[Sophie] What?

01:37.040 --> 01:40.560
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, guys,
I didn't do nothing. I swear.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.240
He was already comatose when I found him.
[grunts]

01:43.960 --> 01:48.720
[scoffs] Oh, my God.
Enzo, you are in really deep this time.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.880
Yeah? And you're not?

01:50.760 --> 01:54.000
What do you think is gonna happen
when the cops come out here,

01:54.080 --> 01:57.680
find out you borrowed a school van,
and have stolen moon crap in your car?

01:57.760 --> 02:00.720
-"Moon crap"? You don't even know what--
-Max! Not the time.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.000
You... you guys, he's right.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.240
-Thank you.
-We can't tell anyone about this.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.120
We could get kicked out or worse.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.040
What do we do? What do we do? Help.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.600
All right. Soph, help me wipe his car
for fingerprints.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.240
Nobody touches the gold plate, okay?

02:18.320 --> 02:19.880
Nerd boy, you heard me?

02:19.960 --> 02:23.480
We'll leave it in the car. That'll make
the boss happy and keep him quiet.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.760
Let's go.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.800
Let's go!

02:31.000 --> 02:34.800
All right, everybody, I want to introduce
our newest Raven, Brooke Osmond.

02:34.880 --> 02:35.840
[all applauding]

02:39.320 --> 02:41.360
Hey, guys, you're here just in time.
Say hi to our newest member.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.280
-Hey!
-What?

02:42.360 --> 02:44.680
[chuckles nervously]
I know this is a little weird,

02:44.760 --> 02:47.080
but just imagine how weird this is for me.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.200
-Did I say something wrong?
-[Leo] Nah.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.040
I'm sure they're just working out
some quantum physics theory in their head

02:59.120 --> 03:01.960
and can't be distracted,
or... I don't know.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.600
Max, I'm starving!

03:07.400 --> 03:09.360
Right! Food.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.720
Gotta go.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.160
Cute couple. Perfect for each other.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.280
-We're not dating!
-We have significant others!

03:19.360 --> 03:20.320
[all laughing]

03:20.400 --> 03:23.200
Hmm. They doth protest too much, methinks.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.240
Ah, quoting Shakespeare already?
You're gonna fit right in.

03:26.920 --> 03:28.200
Let's hit the books, guys.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.240
-Got it!
-[Sophie] Great.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.400
-I need alcohol and gauze.
-[door shuts]

03:41.920 --> 03:44.080
Watch out. Watch out.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.000
-[inhales sharply and groans]
-[Sophie] Oh, stop.

03:48.960 --> 03:52.760
Oh, it looks really deep.
I think he needs stitches.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.520
Oh, God. I hate the sight of blood
or stitches or injuries of any kind.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.640
We're gonna have to sew him up.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.680
[Enzo breathing heavily]

04:03.640 --> 04:04.720
Fine, I'll do it.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.280
Give me that.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.600
-[Enzo groaning]
-[Parker] Calm down, calm down.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.400
Oh, wow.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.680
Wow, that's... [stutters] Wow.

04:18.080 --> 04:22.959
Uh, how about Max and Parker
go and take care of the magnetite?

04:23.040 --> 04:24.200
Good idea, Emma.

04:24.279 --> 04:25.519
[Emma] We need a new gold base
for it anyway.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.880
-I'll do that.
-[Parker] Thank you, Em.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.800
Where'd you find those two studs?
[chuckles]

04:38.240 --> 04:40.960
Bring it on, Soph. I can take it.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.600
[screams]

04:47.200 --> 04:48.200
Now...

04:50.160 --> 04:51.160
take this.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.920
Turn the knob and press this button.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.080
We need to heat up the edge of
the magnetite so it'll mold to the base.

04:58.640 --> 05:02.200
-Okay, you said turn the knob?
-Mmm-hmm.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.280
Okay.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.800
-And, then just...
-Perfect.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.240
[Parker laughs]

05:08.760 --> 05:12.160
Okay, okay. That's pretty cool.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.920
How did you know how to do that?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.800
There's a lot of things
you don't know about Soph.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.520
-Yeah?
-[Enzo] Mmm-hmm.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.520
[Sophie] There's a lot of things
I know about you.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.280
So, when the hell are you gonna
get out of here before I tell everybody?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.200
[coughing]

05:36.160 --> 05:38.760
[grunts] Can I get some water?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.480
-Sure.
-[Enzo clears throat]

05:44.160 --> 05:45.960
Here, just lift your head.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.840
Uh... I'll...

05:50.640 --> 05:52.960
just go get some bottled water.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.120
Soph...

06:01.360 --> 06:02.880
it's just us now, you know.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.280
You can tell me the truth.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.480
[sniffs]

06:08.280 --> 06:09.400
Which is what?

06:09.960 --> 06:11.720
You know what I'm talking about.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.280
[groans] What's wrong with you?

06:17.360 --> 06:18.920
[Leo coughing]

06:20.760 --> 06:22.160
[coughing]

06:26.840 --> 06:29.840
Thanks. At least somebody
is nice around here.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.240
-Seriously?
-Mmm-hmm.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.400
[Enzo grunts]

06:47.280 --> 06:49.000
Hey! Come on.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.680
[both coughing]

06:56.560 --> 06:57.560
Get away from there.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.560
-[Parker] What are you--
-[Max] Hey! Hey! Stop.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.880
[coughs] What the hell are you doing?

07:02.960 --> 07:04.760
That rock is what killed my guy.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.200
-What?
-And it almost killed me, too. Yeah.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.360
-[Parker] What are you talking about?
-I don't know, okay? I don't know.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.960
It's something about the heat.

07:11.040 --> 07:15.000
Heating it makes it toxic or whatever.
It's... it's the smoke that does it.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.440
[Emma] Does Ryan know about this?

07:16.520 --> 07:18.160
If she did, she never
would have given it to us.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.640
-Well, we have to tell her and NASA.
-No! No!

07:21.720 --> 07:23.560
We don't need to tell anybody anything.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.160
Hey, nerd boy.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.640
Put that thing in a refrigerator,
lock it up,

07:28.720 --> 07:32.040
and we don't talk about this ever again.
Got it, Google?

07:32.120 --> 07:34.080
-His name is Max.
-Whatever.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.320
Max.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.720
Thanks for the stitches.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.400
So, what now?

07:52.960 --> 07:55.240
I mean, I guess we do what he said.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.960
Listen, there's still a fake magnetite
on the wall, right?

07:59.040 --> 08:01.360
-Yeah.
-All right, fine. We're good.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.880
Look, no one has to know what happened.
We can all get out of this alive.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.480
Maybe we can tell Ryan,
and she'll be able to--

08:06.560 --> 08:09.800
Tell Ryan what?
That she gave you a poisonous rock?

08:09.880 --> 08:14.240
You wanna get another headmaster fired?
Or do you want him coming after us still?

08:14.320 --> 08:16.520
So what, we're just gonna let
a psycho keep working here?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.200
What else can we do, Sophie?

08:19.280 --> 08:22.040
Now, look. The real gold plate
covered his debt, right?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.280
Okay, so maybe he'll just leave.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.040
Or maybe he won't.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.920
Max, can you...

08:36.000 --> 08:37.960
-Thank you.
-Parker, be careful.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.039
I got it, I got it.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.480
There's a padlock on top of the fridge.
You can lock it with that.

08:47.039 --> 08:48.039
[whispers] Okay.

08:49.720 --> 08:50.920
[clattering]

08:52.400 --> 08:53.520
[fridge door shuts]

09:00.360 --> 09:01.360
[sighs]

09:05.200 --> 09:08.520
-Who's this guy?
-[Jason] Don't know. Never seen him.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.640
Well, he seems to know
what the magnetite can do,

09:12.720 --> 09:14.560
and now those other brats do, too.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.040
I don't understand.
Is there a third piece of magnetite?

09:17.120 --> 09:19.240
No. It's a fake.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.200
-See?
-[Jason] Damn it! What are they planning?

09:29.280 --> 09:30.880
I have no idea.

09:31.840 --> 09:36.720
But we have to get the magnetite
out of the Greenhouse ASAP.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.000
Hey.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.520
-It's a new day, right?
-Yeah. [sighs]

09:53.280 --> 09:55.440
-Everything's gonna be okay.
-[scoffs]

09:58.080 --> 09:59.960
Parker, what's wrong?

10:05.960 --> 10:07.200
[sighs]

10:07.280 --> 10:10.360
[Alex] So, that's that. She's a Raven now.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.160
Unbelievable. Did you talk to her?

10:13.240 --> 10:15.600
No. No, my mom told me.

10:16.680 --> 10:21.560
I don't know what's worse.
Brooke leaving, or Brooke being a Raven.

10:21.640 --> 10:22.880
It doesn't make any sense.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.440
God, this is all my fault.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.880
[Sophie] No, I was...

10:29.600 --> 10:32.040
-It's my fault.
-No, no, no, guys, listen.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.600
All right? We all messed up.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.200
We should have been more understanding.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.360
Look, let's all just go talk to her, okay?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.080
-Yeah, maybe--
-No. Guys...

10:43.560 --> 10:45.880
my mom specifically said we can't do that.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.360
[Daniel sighs]

10:50.680 --> 10:53.360
Well, hey. Guess that means
I officially get to stay.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.920
Yeah, I guess so.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.000
Well, don't get too excited.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.560
Uh, I'm sorry. It's just... weird.

11:03.640 --> 11:07.400
I... I can't picture her
in a Ravens uniform.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.920
[Emma] Red and blue look good on you.
I think.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.520
I don't really know fashion.
Maybe you could teach me.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.200
Uh, okay.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.640
It's so nice to have another cool girl
around here to gossip with.

11:20.720 --> 11:21.880
Okay, sure.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.560
-What is your chess rating? Mine's 2351.
-Um...

11:24.640 --> 11:28.720
Okay, guys. Uh, why don't we give
our new Raven a little time to adjust?

11:28.800 --> 11:29.960
[Louie chiming]

11:31.800 --> 11:34.520
-[Louie chirping]
-Oh, my God, Suzanne's back.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.560
Awesome!
Annual Capture the Flag challenge.

11:36.640 --> 11:37.720
Let's get out there.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.160
Sorry, adjustment time is over.
We need you today.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.120
Well, we did win last year.

11:43.760 --> 11:48.640
I mean, they won.
We lost. You guys, uh, us.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.360
-[both chuckle]
-Right.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.760
Um, you know what I mean.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.440
-You're gonna be a great Raven. Let's go!
-[chuckles]

11:55.920 --> 11:59.680
Hey, guys. Needless to say,
I am very happy to be here

11:59.760 --> 12:02.040
and not staring at a cement wall
eating Jell-O.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.240
[all laugh]

12:03.320 --> 12:05.640
For those of you who don't know the rules
of Capture the Flag,

12:05.720 --> 12:08.640
each team has to hide their flag
above ground.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.600
If you're captured on the other side,

12:10.680 --> 12:13.560
you have to sit on the penalty bench
for five minutes before going back.

12:13.640 --> 12:14.720
[Parker] Wait, wait, wait.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.240
So, this isn't just another "win for
the sake of winning" challenge, is it?

12:17.800 --> 12:18.640
Yes.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.600
But I think the joy of winning
will be most evident

12:21.680 --> 12:23.440
while you're riding on this.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.920
-[all cheering]
-[Suzanne] All right, okay? Okay.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.200
All right, so here are your flags.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.360
You have five minutes to strategize.
Let's go.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.800
[indistinct chatter]

12:34.080 --> 12:35.480
-[both] Thank you.
-Good luck.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.600
All right, guys, we are winning this.

12:39.320 --> 12:42.240
All right, so the Ravens are dying to win
because of their losing streak.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.920
Well, we don't want
to end their streak, dude.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.280
-[laughing]
-True!

12:46.360 --> 12:47.600
Okay, okay, okay. So, what's our strategy?

12:47.680 --> 12:49.840
-Get on that banana boat in an hour.
-Uh-huh!

12:49.920 --> 12:53.800
In this game, strategy is everything.
Obviously, we can't outrun them...

12:53.880 --> 12:55.560
So, we have to get into their heads.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.000
So, we mess with their heads.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.120
-I think I can help you with that.
-[Leo] Right.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.280
-They obviously can't outrun us.
-[Parker] Mmm-mmm.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.240
We'll start by picking off
the slowest ones.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.520
Ooh, Max and Emma.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.720
-Got it.
-There you go.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.200
I hate to break it to you,

13:08.280 --> 13:10.360
but they're gonna wanna go
after you and Max first.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.120
Right,
because we're such great strategists.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.360
Actually, Max and Emma are gonna be
the ones guarding the flag

13:15.440 --> 13:16.360
-because they can't run.
-[Sophie] Mmm-hmm.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.120
We should be looking for it
wherever they are.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.480
Guys, guys, they're not gonna do that.
They're not that predictable.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.520
I think that we should--

13:21.600 --> 13:23.640
Hayley, just trust us, all right?
We got this.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.920
-Yeah, totally.
-We got you.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.560
[Suzanne] All right, guys.
That's enough strategizing.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.640
Let's begin!

13:30.120 --> 13:31.360
[cell phone chimes]

13:38.040 --> 13:39.560
[cell phone continues chiming]

13:50.080 --> 13:52.680
-Hello?
-[distorted voice] <i>Hello, Enzo.</i>

13:52.760 --> 13:53.960
Who the hell is this?

13:54.040 --> 13:57.800
I'm the guy who just wired
$50,000 into your account.

13:57.880 --> 13:58.960
[Enzo] <i>Yeah, right.</i>

13:59.040 --> 14:00.960
And I'm the freaking tooth fairy, bro.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.200
[sighs]

14:29.400 --> 14:31.360
[cell phone chimes]

14:32.600 --> 14:33.560
Hey!

14:33.640 --> 14:35.960
[distorted voice]
<i>Don't hang up on me again.</i>

14:36.040 --> 14:38.160
Yeah, uh... Sorry, bro.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.000
Yeah, no, it'll never happen again.

14:40.080 --> 14:44.080
<i>-Good. That's just an advance.</i>
-An advance for what?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.360
All right, wait, hold on a second.
Who are you?

14:46.440 --> 14:47.600
<i>Well, I'm paying you enough</i>

14:47.680 --> 14:50.320
so you don't have to ask me that,
aren't I?

14:51.040 --> 14:53.680
-Yeah. I guess.
<i>-Good.</i>

14:53.760 --> 14:58.320
<i>Now, I'll pay you ten times that</i>
<i>if you make a very small delivery.</i>

14:58.880 --> 15:00.160
Do you want in?

15:04.280 --> 15:07.280
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Suzanne] Eagles and Ravens, come on!

15:07.360 --> 15:08.720
[cheering]

15:08.800 --> 15:10.200
-[Leo] Come on! Let's win this!
-[student] Yeah!

15:10.280 --> 15:12.000
-[Sophie] We're coming for you.
-[Hayley] I'm going forward.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.000
[Suzanne] All right, come on, guys.
Let's spread out.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.400
[indistinct chatter]

15:15.480 --> 15:16.320
[Suzanne] Ready?

15:17.760 --> 15:18.640
[blows whistle]

15:21.720 --> 15:24.080
Did you know this game was invented
as a way for European children

15:24.160 --> 15:26.720
to send secret messages to the Allies
during World War II?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.640
-Really?
-No.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.280
But that would make a really cool story,
wouldn't it?

15:30.360 --> 15:31.480
Max!

15:31.560 --> 15:32.680
What're you waiting for, Woods?

15:32.760 --> 15:34.880
You're an Eagle now.
You should be able to outrun me.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.000
Yeah, well, Cruz, you're a Raven
and I can still outsmart you.

15:43.640 --> 15:44.640
-Boo!
-[both shriek]

15:44.720 --> 15:46.320
-[Max] I'm gonna get you.
-[Emma] Oh, my God!

15:46.400 --> 15:47.640
[Max grunting] I'm gonna get you!

15:48.680 --> 15:50.480
Ah! I got one. We got one!

15:50.560 --> 15:51.880
How did we do that?

15:52.680 --> 15:55.880
[Becca] Suck it, Eagles!
You're going to jail.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.480
[distorted voice]
<i>You'll write a resignation letter</i>

16:06.560 --> 16:08.240
<i>and leave it on your desk.</i>

16:12.560 --> 16:15.760
<i>Write her that you appreciate</i>
<i>the opportunity</i>

16:15.840 --> 16:18.320
<i>but that job is just not for you.</i>

16:24.880 --> 16:25.840
[sighs]

16:25.920 --> 16:28.920
Get the magnetite. The real one.

16:33.320 --> 16:37.760
<i>Put it in a garbage bag</i>
<i>and cover your tracks. </i>

16:47.880 --> 16:52.280
<i>Leave the Greenhouse</i>
<i>and make sure nobody sees you.</i>

16:52.880 --> 16:58.600
<i>Now, put the bag in the black bin</i>
<i>and leave forever.</i>

17:00.160 --> 17:03.480
<i>Once I get the rock,</i>
<i>I'll wire you the rest of the money </i>

17:03.560 --> 17:06.560
<i>and you're free to do with it</i>
<i>whatever you please.</i>

17:06.640 --> 17:10.839
<i>But if you talk about this to anyone,</i>
<i>it'll be gone.</i>

17:10.920 --> 17:12.560
And so will you.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.040
You think we can trust this guy?

17:17.240 --> 17:20.440
I know his type.
We don't need to trust him.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.200
We just bought him.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.720
[student] Come on, Eagles! Let's go!

17:26.800 --> 17:28.599
You said you could handle the weakling.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.319
Dude, it was on purpose.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.760
Besides, you're the one who got caught
by a Raven girl.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.720
I'm telling you, Sophie,
we need to try a different approach.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.400
Trying to outrun them isn't gonna work.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.560
What? No, look, don't worry.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.200
Look, I know you're new,

17:41.280 --> 17:43.520
but this is the Eagles'
tried and true strategy, okay?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.840
All right, five minutes have gone.
You can go now, guys.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.520
-Oh, we're good?
-Yeah, you're a-go.

17:52.960 --> 17:53.960
[Brooke] Come on, Max! Yeah.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.560
-[Sophie] Come on, Eagles! Nice!
-[Max grunts]

17:56.640 --> 17:58.320
Watch the sneakers! They're new.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.000
There you go.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.240
[Brooke] Let's go, Leo!

18:02.320 --> 18:03.480
[Daniel] Good one, Leo.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.640
No fair. I was on the Raven side.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.000
Becca, I'm sorry.
You were caught fair and square.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.160
[Sophie] Oh, man. Look at that. You see?

18:14.240 --> 18:16.000
I told you.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.400
Watch them stack up.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.280
Soon we can make our move.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.440
[Daniel] Get 'em!

18:23.520 --> 18:25.480
Guys, I told you,
the Eagles will outrun you!

18:26.040 --> 18:27.840
God, this is ridiculous!

18:27.920 --> 18:29.520
You regretting that decision already, B?

18:29.600 --> 18:30.440
Stay out of it, Parker.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.240
-[chuckling]
-[Daniel] Hey! Get her! Get her!

18:35.320 --> 18:36.960
[Parker] Tree! Tree! Tree! Tree!

18:38.160 --> 18:39.640
[Emma] No, no, no, no!

18:40.280 --> 18:41.120
[Daniel] Yeah!

18:41.200 --> 18:42.400
-And she's been got!
-Emma!

18:42.480 --> 18:43.440
[Daniel] Here we go!

18:43.520 --> 18:44.920
-[Sophie] Eagles!
-What am I supposed to do?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.160
-Man our side by myself?
-Come on, Eagles!

18:47.240 --> 18:48.840
Let's go! Come on!

18:49.960 --> 18:52.000
[indistinct chatter and cheering]

18:52.560 --> 18:54.840
This is ridiculous!
I should just give up now.

18:57.320 --> 19:00.720
I can't believe this!
No wonder why you guys lose every year!

19:05.120 --> 19:05.960
What?

19:06.520 --> 19:07.840
Come on. Get back.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.920
Come, come get me!

19:10.640 --> 19:12.320
-[sighs]
-[Alex] Come on!

19:16.440 --> 19:17.520
[Alex sighs]

19:17.600 --> 19:18.680
You look hot.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.400
Want me to wipe your forehead for you?

19:26.600 --> 19:27.520
What?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.400
-No, no, no, no!
-[whistle blows]

19:29.480 --> 19:30.920
[Suzanne] The Ravens have won!

19:31.000 --> 19:32.400
[cheering]

19:32.480 --> 19:33.520
Are you kidding me?

19:34.080 --> 19:35.680
Yay! [laughs]

19:35.760 --> 19:37.280
Hold on! That's not fair.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.120
They must've buried it.
We looked everywhere.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.600
Mmm... No, you didn't.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.160
And you had a whole five minutes
to find it, too.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.360
[whistles]

19:48.080 --> 19:48.920
God!

19:49.000 --> 19:49.840
[Alex] Damn it!

19:49.920 --> 19:54.000
[cheering and chanting]
Ravens! Ravens! Ravens! Ravens!

19:54.080 --> 19:56.400
[chanting continues]

20:24.800 --> 20:27.160
If you hadn't distracted me,
I would have found the flag.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.080
-Me?
-[Parker] Yeah.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.720
You're the one analyzing the game
like some expert commentator on ESPN.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.000
We all know Brooke told 'em our strategy.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.360
If we hadn't let her go,
this wouldn't have happened.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.320
He's right.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.960
You guys, we didn't lose
because of Brooke.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.360
We lost because we were
predictable and complacent.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.320
Hayley, let's not place blame.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.920
Are you kidding me?
That's all you guys have been doing.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
They beat us because
they're better than us.

20:49.080 --> 20:49.960
Accept that and move on.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.440
-No, see here, we don't accept losing.
-[Daniel] Yeah.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.360
Well, then, Parker, get used to living
a really long and unhappy life.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.720
-[scoffs]
-[Hayley] Losing is what makes you better.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.040
You know what? Who cares?

20:59.920 --> 21:02.800
We're the Eagles. We're already the best.

21:02.880 --> 21:03.720
[all] Yeah!

21:04.240 --> 21:05.640
-I'm being honest...
-[Sophie] Right?

21:05.720 --> 21:06.840
-[Parker] Eagles!
-Can we take a walk, please?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.720
[sighs] Look, I'm really not in the mood.

21:09.800 --> 21:10.880
Really?

21:11.440 --> 21:13.600
You'd rather just sit here
and wallow in your pity?

21:14.280 --> 21:15.120
You know what?

21:15.960 --> 21:18.720
You deal with things your way,
and I'll deal with them mine.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.360
Fine, I will.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.120
-Let her go, let her go, D.
-Yeah, just...

21:27.960 --> 21:29.160
[Daniel sighs]

22:15.600 --> 22:16.440
Hello.

22:17.760 --> 22:18.640
Well...

22:20.240 --> 22:21.160
hello.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.280
Thanks for this.

22:29.920 --> 22:30.880
Any time.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.200
["Lies" playing]
