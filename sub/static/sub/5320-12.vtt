WEBVTT

00:01.491 --> 00:03.159
So, um...

00:03.226 --> 00:04.260
How have you been?
Yeah.

00:04.327 --> 00:05.661
We are... just curious

00:05.729 --> 00:06.996
how you're doing.

00:07.063 --> 00:08.497
I'm fine.

00:08.565 --> 00:11.800
Look, I know that
you say you're fine,

00:11.868 --> 00:12.768
but you're not fine.

00:12.836 --> 00:13.903
I'm fine.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.571
You're not fine.

00:15.639 --> 00:16.705
You're making me not fine.

00:16.773 --> 00:17.439
Andre, he said he's fine.

00:17.507 --> 00:18.407
Andre, he's fine.

00:18.475 --> 00:19.475
I'm high.

00:19.543 --> 00:20.676
Thank you.

00:20.744 --> 00:22.411
I'm also fine.
Ruxin,

00:22.479 --> 00:23.546
I'm glad that you're fine

00:23.613 --> 00:24.813
because it's coming down

00:24.881 --> 00:25.981
to the final weeks
of the football season

00:26.049 --> 00:27.550
and we're all sort of

00:27.617 --> 00:29.785
in contention for
the playoff so,

00:29.853 --> 00:32.287
we could, you know, start...

00:32.354 --> 00:35.691
getting things...
back to normal.

00:35.759 --> 00:37.960
I don't think I'm following.
Well...

00:38.028 --> 00:39.762
You know, the last two weeks

00:39.829 --> 00:41.363
have been not normal weeks
Mm-hmm.

00:41.431 --> 00:43.199
in that we've been
sort of giving you

00:43.266 --> 00:45.234
that, you know, free spin.

00:45.302 --> 00:47.603
Um...
Yeah, we just kind of let you

00:47.671 --> 00:50.039
play with the house's
money the last couple weeks.

00:50.106 --> 00:52.575
You know, you could phone
a friend, you, uh,

00:52.642 --> 00:53.842
get out of jail
free cards, you know, those...

00:53.910 --> 00:55.110
Yeah. Free card, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, so...

00:55.178 --> 00:56.879
Were you guys playing games
of Monopoly

00:56.947 --> 00:58.480
without me, or...

00:58.548 --> 00:59.481
We want you to stop crying
about your dead wife

00:59.549 --> 01:01.150
and set a lineup.

01:01.218 --> 01:02.685
Oh, boy.

01:02.752 --> 01:06.021
But I still get
to win regardless?

01:06.089 --> 01:07.890
No.

01:07.958 --> 01:09.225
No win, it's just back to normal

01:09.292 --> 01:11.193
where if you lose, you lose,

01:11.261 --> 01:12.661
you win, you win.

01:12.729 --> 01:14.230
Yeah, what he said.
Yeah.

01:15.465 --> 01:16.799
Fine.

01:16.866 --> 01:18.400
Fine. He's...
It's fine. Great.

01:18.468 --> 01:20.035
We have a fine.
Good. He's not fine.

01:20.103 --> 01:21.670
Andre, he said he's fine.
He's fine.

01:21.738 --> 01:23.138
You know what,
I'm going to get out of here.

01:23.206 --> 01:24.707
Take it easy, buddy.

01:24.774 --> 01:25.674
Glad you're fine.

01:25.742 --> 01:27.243
On other news,

01:27.310 --> 01:28.644
I got those tickets for
<i>The Force Awakens...</i>

01:28.712 --> 01:30.012
What did you guys...
Did you guys say something?

01:30.080 --> 01:30.779
What?
Huh?

01:30.847 --> 01:32.548
Like... team, lineup,

01:32.616 --> 01:34.083
wins or something?

01:34.150 --> 01:35.651
I didn't say anything.
Did you say anything?

01:35.719 --> 01:37.586
I don't think so.
No.

01:37.654 --> 01:39.510
Fine.

01:39.879 --> 01:50.413
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:51.301 --> 01:52.768
Sofia?

01:52.836 --> 01:54.136
Almost.

01:54.204 --> 01:55.671
Oh, God!

01:55.739 --> 01:57.172
What the hell are you doing
here, Rafi?

01:57.240 --> 01:59.475
I want you to think of me
as your death Sherpa,

01:59.542 --> 02:02.544
here to guide you through
Rafi's 13 stages of grief.

02:02.612 --> 02:04.113
I'm fine. Thank you though.

02:04.180 --> 02:06.849
If you're fine, then do
these bath salts with me

02:06.916 --> 02:08.350
and go on a vision quest.

02:08.418 --> 02:09.818
No!
Okay.

02:09.886 --> 02:11.787
Then do <i> these</i> bath salts with me

02:11.855 --> 02:13.389
and watch the movie
<i>Vision Quest.</i>

02:13.456 --> 02:14.523
No!

02:14.591 --> 02:15.691
You're not fine.

02:15.759 --> 02:16.925
You're still suffering.

02:16.993 --> 02:18.260
Sofia's still in you.

02:18.328 --> 02:20.596
In here, in here and in here.

02:20.664 --> 02:22.431
Ah!
I made a deal with Sofia,

02:22.499 --> 02:23.899
that if anything were
to ever happen to her,

02:23.967 --> 02:25.467
and I wasn't the cause of it,

02:25.535 --> 02:27.703
that I would take care of you
for the rest of my life.

02:27.771 --> 02:29.505
And that's what I'm going to do.

02:29.572 --> 02:31.507
I'm here to cook,
I'm going to clean.

02:31.574 --> 02:33.735
Look, I'm already going to go
clean out the pee corner.

02:33.743 --> 02:35.177
With a plunger?

02:35.245 --> 02:37.613
I had a pretty chunky pee earlier.
Excuse me?

02:37.681 --> 02:39.448
A thick piss.
What?

02:39.516 --> 02:41.483
I had heavy brown water
come out of me butt.

02:41.551 --> 02:42.851
You had diarrhea in my kitchen.

02:42.919 --> 02:45.254
I mean, that's
a crass way to put it.

02:45.322 --> 02:48.324
Listen, we're going to get
through this, together.

02:48.391 --> 02:50.459
Oh, God, you used
the plunger already.

02:50.527 --> 02:52.194
Yeah, I clogged
the toilets up earlier.

02:52.262 --> 02:53.429
With shit?
No, with the pasta.

02:53.496 --> 02:54.630
I was cooking.

02:54.698 --> 02:56.832
Enough chitchat, let's eat.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.701
<i>I'm just, you know,</i>

02:58.768 --> 03:00.069
worried about Ruxin.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.603
I know, it's tough.

03:01.671 --> 03:02.938
He just wants to be alone.

03:03.006 --> 03:04.206
I know, it's like
he doesn't even want

03:04.274 --> 03:06.308
to use that rezzy
for Rajasthan either.

03:06.376 --> 03:07.976
Are you worried about Ruxin

03:08.044 --> 03:09.478
or Ruxin's reservation?

03:09.546 --> 03:10.746
Both.

03:10.814 --> 03:12.815
Our good friend
just lost his wife,

03:12.882 --> 03:14.883
and now we might lose
this rezzy, too.

03:14.951 --> 03:16.085
Don't say "rezzy" anymore.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.720
It's gross.

03:17.787 --> 03:19.188
I get that Ruxin doesn't want
to go,

03:19.255 --> 03:21.123
but does that mean that we all
have to cancel the rezzy?

03:21.191 --> 03:22.524
We don't have to cancel anything

03:22.592 --> 03:23.992
because we don't have
a reservation.

03:23.993 --> 03:25.394
Ruxin has a reservation.

03:25.462 --> 03:27.196
But we're friends of the rezzy.

03:27.263 --> 03:29.263
You know what, no rezzy.
We're sorry, we're booked.

03:29.265 --> 03:30.165
What?
Bye.

03:31.368 --> 03:33.569
I think he wants us to go.

03:35.305 --> 03:36.672
<i>You guys are not
going to believe this.</i>

03:36.740 --> 03:38.173
Okay, you know I've been
dabbling in DraftKings...

03:38.241 --> 03:40.409
Uh, uh, uh, uh! Nah!
Unless it's about this league,

03:40.477 --> 03:41.710
no one cares.

03:41.778 --> 03:43.139
No, I'm just saying,
I did so well,

03:43.179 --> 03:44.446
I've been invited to a huge
year-end tournament.

03:44.514 --> 03:45.848
Do you realize what
you're doing?

03:45.915 --> 03:47.383
It's like bragging about
your mistress to your wife.

03:47.450 --> 03:48.484
Yeah, it's gross.

03:48.551 --> 03:49.785
You don't understand.

03:49.853 --> 03:51.353
Only 200 people
have been invited.

03:51.421 --> 03:52.955
Do you guys hear anything?
Nope.

03:53.022 --> 03:54.957
Just a sad, lonely
buzzing sound.

03:55.024 --> 03:56.125
Be jealous.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.393
See where that gets you.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.894
How's my team doing
on DraftKings?

03:58.962 --> 04:00.229
You won, Taco.
Congratulations.

04:00.296 --> 04:02.398
Ooh. Can't wait
to get that check.

04:02.465 --> 04:03.866
Wait, just got a message.

04:03.933 --> 04:05.334
From the site?

04:05.402 --> 04:06.535
What does that say?

04:06.603 --> 04:08.036
"Your league has been suspended

04:08.104 --> 04:09.705
due to inappropriate content"?

04:09.773 --> 04:11.774
What?! What?!
What are you talking about?

04:11.841 --> 04:13.682
Hold on.
It's a fantasy football message board.

04:13.710 --> 04:15.244
All the content
is inappropriate.

04:15.311 --> 04:16.845
Hey, did you guys get my video?

04:16.913 --> 04:18.113
What?
What video?

04:18.180 --> 04:19.481
I just posted a video
to your message board.

04:19.548 --> 04:20.882
What was the video?
Oh, it's hilarious.

04:20.950 --> 04:22.584
It's me and Dirty Randy
in Puerto Rico.

04:22.652 --> 04:24.787
We went to this place where you
can have sex with exotic birds.

04:24.854 --> 04:26.922
It's called, like,
a national park.

04:26.990 --> 04:28.457
- That's why they blocked us off the site.
- Rafi!

04:28.525 --> 04:30.492
- Watch it. It's hilarious.
- No!

04:30.560 --> 04:32.528
You broke our
fantasy football site.

04:32.595 --> 04:33.962
It's the week before
the playoffs, Rafi.

04:34.030 --> 04:35.664
Puerto Rico has

04:35.732 --> 04:37.633
- the sluttiest birds.
- I saw it.

04:37.700 --> 04:38.801
The birds did seem very into it.

04:38.868 --> 04:40.536
I can't get into
the manager site?

04:40.603 --> 04:43.472
There we go. There goes our
entire fantasy football season.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.140
You gotta fix this, Kevin.
You're the commissioner.

04:45.208 --> 04:46.308
You know what?
I have a solution.

04:46.376 --> 04:48.043
Just make me the champion,

04:48.111 --> 04:49.645
I lost my wife,
and we'll just call it.

04:49.712 --> 04:50.946
No! No!
No! No, all right.

04:51.014 --> 04:52.414
No.
I will-I will take care of this.

04:52.482 --> 04:53.715
I'll-I'll deal with it,

04:53.783 --> 04:55.083
just like our fantasy
forefathers before us.

04:55.151 --> 04:57.152
What are you going
to do, add it up?

04:57.220 --> 04:59.288
Yeah, I'll just,
I'll add it up, old-school.

04:59.355 --> 05:00.622
We can't do that
anymore. Okay?

05:00.690 --> 05:02.191
Our brains are different.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.792
We have cell phones and apps
and we don't read articles

05:03.860 --> 05:05.340
that have less than
15 pictures, okay?

05:05.361 --> 05:06.962
Andre, we all went to school.

05:07.030 --> 05:09.097
We know how to add.
It's just simple arithmetic.

05:09.165 --> 05:10.799
I'll take care of it.
I haven't added since 1995.

05:10.867 --> 05:13.535
Wait a second, Brian, did you
grow up with four fathers?

05:16.940 --> 05:18.106
Hello.
Hello.

05:18.174 --> 05:19.775
Welcome to Rajasthan.
How may I help you?

05:19.776 --> 05:21.276
Uh, I'm here for a reservation.

05:21.344 --> 05:23.145
Oh, well, we're fully
booked until, uh, March.

05:23.146 --> 05:24.426
Oh, no, an existing reservation.

05:24.481 --> 05:26.582
Oh.
For this Tuesday,

05:26.649 --> 05:29.117
December 22,
under the name "Ruxin,"

05:29.185 --> 05:31.253
and I just need
to transfer it to "Nowzick."

05:31.321 --> 05:33.589
Mr. Raxin?
Mr. Ruxin, yeah.

05:33.656 --> 05:35.390
He's, uh, been very helpful
to our restaurant group.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.526
Is there a problem?
He doesn't want to dine with us?

05:37.594 --> 05:40.128
No, he would love
to dine with you.

05:40.196 --> 05:42.498
It's just...

05:42.565 --> 05:44.199
his wife passed away.

05:44.267 --> 05:46.168
And so... Yeah.
I wanted to come in here

05:46.236 --> 05:48.670
and just switch the reservation,

05:48.738 --> 05:51.039
because I-I'd hate to...
for it to go to waste.

05:51.107 --> 05:53.242
So, Mr. Raxin's wife
passed away,

05:53.309 --> 05:55.210
and you would like
to take his reservation.

05:55.278 --> 05:56.912
Say it like that,
it sounds awful,

05:56.980 --> 05:59.915
but it's not awful,
because at the funeral,

05:59.983 --> 06:02.150
you know, Ruxin looked at me,
and he said,

06:02.218 --> 06:04.219
"I want you to continue dining

06:04.287 --> 06:06.922
at Michelin-star restaurants."

06:06.990 --> 06:09.625
At Mr. Raxin's wife's funeral...

06:09.692 --> 06:12.661
Ruxin.
Mr. Raxin told you...

06:12.729 --> 06:14.630
Mm-hmm.
...that you should continue dining

06:14.697 --> 06:15.998
at Michelin-star restaurants?

06:16.065 --> 06:17.432
Pretty amazing guy, right?

06:17.500 --> 06:20.202
Oh, hold on one second.
This is crazy.

06:20.270 --> 06:23.939
. This is, uh,
from Mr. Ruxin.

06:24.007 --> 06:26.208
His wife isn't dead.

06:27.644 --> 06:29.878
That must have been
an awkward funeral.

06:29.913 --> 06:30.913
Well, this i..

06:30.980 --> 06:32.881
Mr., uh...?
Yeah. Nowzick.

06:32.949 --> 06:34.283
...Nosechick,
I don't know

06:34.350 --> 06:36.685
if you are lying or
telling the truth,

06:36.753 --> 06:38.654
because it seems to be
pouring out of you

06:38.721 --> 06:39.922
in equal measure.
All right.

06:39.989 --> 06:41.523
However, let me be clear.
Sure.

06:41.591 --> 06:42.891
If Mr. Raxin...

06:42.959 --> 06:44.126
Ruxin.
...doesn't show up

06:44.193 --> 06:46.662
on December 22,
we will not be able

06:46.729 --> 06:49.464
to honor this reservation.
Great.

06:49.532 --> 06:54.937
I will then see you on the 22nd
with Mr. Ruxin

06:55.004 --> 06:57.539
and maybe his wife.

07:01.244 --> 07:03.211
How you doing?

07:03.279 --> 07:05.047
I've had better weeks.

07:05.114 --> 07:06.548
Look, I'm here to tell you that,

07:06.616 --> 07:08.717
when one door closes,
another door opens.

07:08.785 --> 07:10.719
Just like Rajasthan,
which opens on Tuesday,

07:10.787 --> 07:12.020
and I think we
should go together.

07:12.088 --> 07:13.155
And how about this?

07:13.222 --> 07:15.624
We go, you talk
to the maître d',

07:15.692 --> 07:17.526
you say, "Table
for Rodney Ruxin,"

07:17.594 --> 07:18.860
we all go in there,

07:18.928 --> 07:20.662
and if you're uncomfortable
at any moment,

07:20.730 --> 07:23.231
you just... you leave.

07:23.299 --> 07:24.433
I don't think so, man.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.767
What, are you gonna
grief-tinker here?

07:25.835 --> 07:27.355
It's the only thing
that keeps me sane.

07:27.370 --> 07:28.870
Look at this!
Oh, my God!

07:28.938 --> 07:30.472
Look in the bag!
What is it?

07:30.540 --> 07:31.740
It's a dead possum in a bag.

07:31.808 --> 07:34.176
Stage three of Rafi's
grief therapy

07:34.243 --> 07:36.578
is facing death.

07:36.646 --> 07:38.914
You can't move forward until
you've looked death in the face

07:38.982 --> 07:40.248
and swallowed its blood.

07:40.316 --> 07:41.883
You want me to drink that blood?

07:41.951 --> 07:43.218
Yeah. It's not that bad.

07:43.286 --> 07:44.820
You've had some?
Well, yeah.

07:44.887 --> 07:47.207
I wouldn't prescribe a treatment
that I wouldn't myself do.

07:47.223 --> 07:48.624
Possums are basically

07:48.691 --> 07:50.359
rodent pomegranates.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.561
They're full of antioxidants.

07:52.629 --> 07:54.229
Right, Doctor?
I'm out.

07:54.297 --> 07:56.031
Take care, Andre.
Great to see you, man.

07:56.099 --> 07:58.166
Ugh. Get the possum out of here.

07:58.234 --> 08:00.035
Listen, Ruxin.
Inside this bag...

08:00.103 --> 08:01.169
Is a dead possum.

08:01.237 --> 08:03.372
Or is Sofia.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.140
If Sofia was hit by my car.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.342
And what we need
to figure out right now

08:07.410 --> 08:10.178
is how you are going
to get over Sofia/possum.

08:10.246 --> 08:11.380
Let's get through this,

08:11.447 --> 08:13.482
because we've got
so many more stages to go.

08:13.549 --> 08:14.750
What is stage four--
rabies shot?

08:14.817 --> 08:16.184
Stage four is shallow grave.

08:16.252 --> 08:17.185
Whose shallow grave?

08:17.253 --> 08:18.387
Your own.

08:22.445 --> 08:24.713
Okay, Russell wants
DeAndre Hopkins on the bench,

08:24.781 --> 08:27.221
Vincent Jackson in the lineup.

08:28.218 --> 08:30.152
Okay, Ruxin.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.688
"Drop Matt Prater,
add Robbie Gould."

08:32.756 --> 08:34.023
Fine, Ruxin.

08:34.090 --> 08:35.924
Drop Matt Prater...

08:37.861 --> 08:39.528
- Hello.
- Kevin, it's Andre.

08:39.596 --> 08:41.730
I put in a waiver order for
John Brown. I didn't get him.

08:41.798 --> 08:43.799
Because you didn't have
waiver priority, Andre.

08:43.866 --> 08:45.367
That's crazy.
How do you know?

08:45.435 --> 08:47.770
I'm looking at it right here.
Sounds suspect.

08:47.837 --> 08:49.471
I'm gonna come over there
and see with my own two eyes.

08:49.539 --> 08:51.807
No, do not come over. Andre!

08:51.875 --> 08:53.242
Oh, come on.

08:53.309 --> 08:54.376
Give me this.

08:54.444 --> 08:55.611
"Do not drop Prater."

08:55.679 --> 08:57.780
God.

08:57.847 --> 09:00.215
Russell, are you kidding me?
DeAndre Hopkins back in?

09:02.385 --> 09:04.319
Dan Carpenter? Ugh.

09:04.387 --> 09:05.508
At least your lineup is set.

09:08.692 --> 09:11.093
"Adam Vinatieri."

09:11.161 --> 09:12.661
Happy, Ruxin?
There's your kicker.

09:12.729 --> 09:14.496
The golden pony.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.534
What?!

09:19.669 --> 09:21.837
Oh, just let yourself in.

09:21.905 --> 09:23.706
Yeah, I picked the lock.
I didn't want to bother you.

09:23.773 --> 09:24.873
What do you want?

09:24.941 --> 09:26.542
Well, since the
league site's down,

09:26.609 --> 09:29.278
the message board's offline,
so it's now powered by MyFace.

09:29.345 --> 09:33.382
And I've got a delivery of
smack-talk messages for you.

09:33.450 --> 09:35.684
What?
Ruxin wanted me to post a rant.

09:35.752 --> 09:39.421
It's long, but it's filled with
really interesting tidbits.

09:39.489 --> 09:43.592
For example, I did not know
that you ate a ton of ass.

09:43.660 --> 09:44.793
No.
Huh. Yeah.

09:44.861 --> 09:47.596
And since when are
you a come junkie?

09:47.664 --> 09:49.598
What? There's no such thing
as a come junkie.

09:49.666 --> 09:51.934
Well, according to Ruxin,
I'm talking to one right now.

09:52.001 --> 09:53.268
You can't get addicted to come.

09:53.336 --> 09:54.570
Says who?

09:54.637 --> 09:57.106
Will you please leave my house,
you idiot?

09:57.173 --> 09:59.293
Ooh, that's good stuff.
Save it for the message board.

09:59.309 --> 10:01.210
Write it down.

10:01.277 --> 10:03.545
Here. It's a two-parter.

10:04.914 --> 10:07.149
That's not how
the message board works.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.322
Extra, extra.
Read all your shit talk.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.860
Get your daily message board.

10:17.927 --> 10:20.295
Daily message board delivery.

10:20.363 --> 10:22.297
Oh. It's a big one.

10:22.365 --> 10:23.766
Yeah, it's the Sunday edition.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.168
So I'm guessing Ruxin
still hasn't left his house.

10:26.236 --> 10:28.337
Yeah, he's too busy
faxing me every 30 seconds.

10:28.404 --> 10:30.072
Come on, guys. It's game day.

10:30.140 --> 10:31.907
Keep the message board
chatter up.

10:31.975 --> 10:33.942
I'm posting all the time,
but no one reads them.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.890
Yeah, your stupid posts
went in the junk folder.

10:35.945 --> 10:37.045
I gotta say,

10:37.113 --> 10:38.747
this is weird--

10:38.815 --> 10:40.883
watching the games
without computers.

10:40.950 --> 10:42.785
Yeah, there are way less screens
to not care about.

10:42.852 --> 10:45.254
Anybody got tabs on how
Devonta Freeman is doing?

10:45.321 --> 10:47.389
You don't have Devonta.
Well, I have him in my daily league...

10:47.457 --> 10:49.391
Uh-uh. No, no, no, no.
No daily league talk here, okay?

10:49.459 --> 10:50.793
Here we go.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.728
We are bombarded by
their commercials, okay?

10:52.796 --> 10:55.497
The last thing I need is
you squawking about it.

10:55.565 --> 10:56.765
It's old-school, Pete.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.768
Embrace it. It brings us
back to a simpler time.

10:59.836 --> 11:02.204
A time before there were
daily fantasy ads

11:02.272 --> 11:04.439
every 30 seconds
or weekly payouts.

11:04.507 --> 11:05.908
A time where we played
fantasy football

11:05.975 --> 11:07.543
for the love of the game

11:07.610 --> 11:09.611
that reduced the game
that we love to points.

11:09.679 --> 11:11.013
Amen.
Amen.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.115
Do you remember that, Pete?
Back then, it was just

11:13.183 --> 11:15.751
a celebration of narcissistic
individual achievement.

11:15.819 --> 11:18.287
To be able to make up a trophy
that metaphorically said,

11:18.354 --> 11:20.055
"I just
you in the ass."

11:20.123 --> 11:21.690
And then to have that trophy

11:21.758 --> 11:23.492
literally  you
in the ass.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.093
"I'm inside me!"

11:25.161 --> 11:27.529
Yes.
That only happened like one time.

11:27.597 --> 11:29.398
Pete, think about that.

11:29.465 --> 11:31.333
Try to remember that feeling.

11:31.401 --> 11:32.801
The feeling that you had

11:32.869 --> 11:35.170
when you didn't care anymore
about the Bears,

11:35.238 --> 11:37.372
because the 3-Petes
had Aaron Rodgers,

11:37.440 --> 11:40.375
the Lady MacArthurs were
a team you wanted to destroy,

11:40.443 --> 11:43.445
and you wanted to be inside
the Pleasures of Andre's Sister.

11:43.513 --> 11:45.881
Those were the teams
that mattered.

11:45.949 --> 11:48.383
Now it's just... it's
all about the money.

11:48.451 --> 11:50.211
I don't know if now
is a bad time to mention,

11:50.220 --> 11:52.087
I'm actually in the running for
millions of dollars, so it's...

11:52.155 --> 11:53.622
Oh, come on.

11:53.690 --> 11:55.624
Oh, there you go, Pete.
Devonta Freeman just got

11:55.692 --> 11:57.559
his third touchdown of the day.
What?! Yeah!

11:57.627 --> 11:59.127
How dare you.
No, no, no. Shh.

11:59.195 --> 12:00.715
I was gonna say,
it's very interesting,

12:00.763 --> 12:02.331
and I'm gonna get a beer.

12:02.398 --> 12:04.666
So, who's winning
this shit show?

12:04.734 --> 12:06.702
No one yet, but I have to wait
till the Monday games

12:06.769 --> 12:08.704
are over, then I
can do the math.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.106
I have a message for
your message board, Taco.

12:11.174 --> 12:13.275
Post this bad boy.
Oh.

12:13.343 --> 12:14.743
"Bulls hit."

12:14.811 --> 12:15.911
Basketball-related. Hmm.

12:17.447 --> 12:19.681
God, Ruxin's at it again.
Oh, you know what?

12:19.749 --> 12:21.316
I actually have been wanting
to post something

12:21.384 --> 12:22.851
on the message board as well.

12:22.919 --> 12:25.287
Ah, can't wait
to read your message.

12:28.858 --> 12:30.459
<i>Thanks for coming over</i>

12:30.526 --> 12:31.927
to watch the games here.

12:31.995 --> 12:34.162
Well, I didn't really have
a choice, did I, Ruxin?

12:34.230 --> 12:35.791
Considering you
continued to inundate me

12:35.798 --> 12:37.532
with fax after fax after fax.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.334
Okay, how are my boys doing?

12:39.402 --> 12:41.436
You having fun? Ooh, you need
some more chippies?

12:41.504 --> 12:43.939
Here we go.
You're blocking the TV.

12:44.007 --> 12:45.807
Ugh. See what he's like to me
when he's watching his games?

12:45.875 --> 12:46.842
I'm all but invisible.

12:46.910 --> 12:48.543
What is going on here?

12:48.611 --> 12:51.480
Sorry. This is stage nine
of Rafi's grief therapy.

12:51.547 --> 12:52.714
"Everything back to normal."
Right.

12:52.782 --> 12:54.583
Ruxin's used to having
a wife around the house

12:54.617 --> 12:58.353
to do stuff, so... for now,
that's going to be me.

12:58.421 --> 13:00.188
This makes perfect sense, and
I'm happy for both of you.

13:00.256 --> 13:01.536
How about a coaster
there, buddy?

13:01.591 --> 13:02.891
Otherwise, there's gonna
be a ring on the table.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.560
Well, so what?
I bought the coffee table.

13:04.627 --> 13:06.828
If there's a ring, there's a ring.
Oh, this is what it is.

13:06.896 --> 13:08.096
He's always throwing
the money in my face.

13:08.164 --> 13:10.198
You know, you don't
appreciate everything I do.

13:10.266 --> 13:12.167
I happen to have made you
a delicious dinner last night,

13:12.235 --> 13:13.368
which he did not touch.

13:13.436 --> 13:14.517
He cooked it in the toilet.

13:14.570 --> 13:15.537
I cooked it in the kitchen.

13:15.605 --> 13:16.638
The kitchen toilet.

13:16.706 --> 13:18.707
No, I cooked it
in the toilet kitchen.

13:18.775 --> 13:20.142
Okay, you know what?
I'm-I'm a little uncomfortable.

13:20.209 --> 13:22.044
I just think you guys
should settle this on your own.

13:22.111 --> 13:23.745
Brian, you stay right there.
I want you to see

13:23.813 --> 13:25.781
the way he treats me.
He won't even look at me.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.116
Look at me!
Kevin, all you hearing is the nagging?

13:28.184 --> 13:30.945
- Are you hearing the nagging
that I get every day? - Oh, the nagging!

13:30.987 --> 13:33.355
That's all he says-- the nagging, the nagging.
The nagging. Nag, nag.

13:33.423 --> 13:35.057
You know what? TV off, okay?

13:35.124 --> 13:37.092
Turn the TV back on. Turn the TV back on.
TV off right now.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
Because you are gonna
look at me...

13:38.227 --> 13:40.128
I am watching TV with my friend!

13:40.196 --> 13:41.830
I deserve your love!

13:41.898 --> 13:43.165
You don't deserve shit!

13:43.232 --> 13:44.599
Oh, wow!

13:44.667 --> 13:47.002
I deserve as much shit
as anybody else.

13:47.070 --> 13:50.011
Kevin, do you see what I
deal with on a day-to-day basis?

13:50.078 --> 13:51.679
If it wasn't for Baby Geoffrey,
I would leave.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.281
His name is Kevin!

13:53.348 --> 13:55.716
His name is Baby Geoffrey!
He's our son!

13:55.784 --> 13:57.084
How do you not know that?

13:57.152 --> 13:58.419
He's not your son.
Okay, fine.

13:58.487 --> 14:01.122
Here you go. You can watch
your precious games.

14:01.190 --> 14:02.356
Thank you.
You can talk to your precious friends.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.691
I'm done with you!

14:03.759 --> 14:06.027
Stage nine is over!

14:06.094 --> 14:07.495
Oh, my God.

14:07.563 --> 14:09.664
Oh, and by the way,

14:09.731 --> 14:10.765
I'm pregnant.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.767
I pooped on it this morning,

14:12.835 --> 14:14.135
and it's positive.

14:14.203 --> 14:15.970
And it's yours!

14:17.206 --> 14:18.639
Oh, God, why did I smell it?

14:18.707 --> 14:20.994
Congratulations.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.667
That's ten for the defense,

14:25.735 --> 14:27.335
14 for Calvin Johnson,

14:27.403 --> 14:29.308
12 for Eric Decker and...

14:29.428 --> 14:32.722
and bam! 12 hundred and 17.

14:32.842 --> 14:34.943
How's it going there,
Beautiful Mind?

14:35.011 --> 14:36.111
Uh, pretty good.

14:36.178 --> 14:38.856
So... am I in the playoffs?

14:38.976 --> 14:40.272
Ah, we'll see.

14:40.509 --> 14:42.100
We'll see. Oh,
see you later.

14:42.168 --> 14:44.200
I have no idea.

14:48.474 --> 14:49.975
No, no, no, no.

14:50.043 --> 14:51.944
Ruxin, Ruxin, listen to me.
No, no, no.

14:52.011 --> 14:53.178
Just hear me out on this, okay?

14:53.246 --> 14:54.846
No.
This is it.

14:54.914 --> 14:57.449
This is the final stage
of Rafi's grief therapy.

14:57.517 --> 14:58.684
I don't want it.

14:58.751 --> 14:59.751
A release.
Oh, my God.

14:59.819 --> 15:01.553
Okay?
Oh, my God.

15:01.621 --> 15:02.888
Rafi.
See, you weren't able

15:02.956 --> 15:05.857
to make love to Sofia
one last time before she died.

15:05.925 --> 15:08.994
So for tonight, I will be Sofia.

15:09.062 --> 15:11.096
And you will make love to me...
Rafi.

15:11.164 --> 15:12.998
No, I'm your
beautiful wife, Sofia.

15:13.066 --> 15:14.066
No, you have a beard
and smell like

15:14.133 --> 15:15.200
a grease fire at a crab shack.

15:15.268 --> 15:17.703
I'm Sofia.

15:17.770 --> 15:20.272
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

15:20.340 --> 15:21.807
Sofia.

15:21.874 --> 15:23.742
Yeah?

15:23.810 --> 15:25.444
I am not going to
have sex with you.

15:25.511 --> 15:27.079
Ooh, hard to get.

15:27.146 --> 15:28.647
No, I'm not playing hard to get.
Okay, I'll play

15:28.715 --> 15:30.849
this game, mister. Beep, boop, beep.
Stop.

15:30.917 --> 15:33.619
Don't worry-- Sofia told me
everything you like.

15:33.686 --> 15:35.520
I can do it all.
Better.

15:35.588 --> 15:37.356
Okay.

15:37.423 --> 15:38.991
All right.

15:39.058 --> 15:40.092
Let's do this.
Let's do this.

15:40.159 --> 15:42.394
Oh, I'm ready for action.

15:42.462 --> 15:45.163
Maybe I'll set the mood.
Ooh, I love this.

15:45.231 --> 15:46.565
A little romance.
Yeah.

15:46.633 --> 15:48.133
Now we're talking.

15:48.201 --> 15:50.302
- Let me just take this...
-  Yeah.

15:50.370 --> 15:51.370
What is that?
It's a vanilla candle.

15:51.437 --> 15:53.572
No, no...
Yeah.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.607
You know that vanilla candles
make me nauseous.

15:55.675 --> 15:57.276
Ruxin, put that aw...

15:57.343 --> 15:59.177
It's your favorite, Sofia.
No.

15:59.245 --> 16:00.712
No, no, it's me, bro,
Rafi, for a minute.

16:00.780 --> 16:02.314
I know that your brother Rafi

16:02.382 --> 16:04.182
- has a gag reflex when he smells
vanilla candles. - No, no, R...

16:04.250 --> 16:06.752
Ruxin. Time out, Ruxin.

16:06.819 --> 16:08.720
Sofia, stop dry-heaving

16:08.821 --> 16:10.422
for one second and listen to me.

16:10.490 --> 16:11.957
I love you

16:12.025 --> 16:14.693
and I'll never stop loving you,

16:14.761 --> 16:17.462
but it's time to let you go.

16:17.530 --> 16:19.531
I release you.

16:19.599 --> 16:21.600
Aw...

16:21.668 --> 16:23.068
Hey...

16:23.136 --> 16:24.469
I'm proud of you, man.

16:24.537 --> 16:26.204
You did it.

16:26.272 --> 16:29.741
Now let's celebrate with
some man-on-man butt stuff.

16:29.776 --> 16:32.244
No.

16:32.278 --> 16:33.512
I'm gonna have dinner
with my buddies.

16:33.579 --> 16:34.813
I'll change and join?

16:34.881 --> 16:36.848
I'm going to leave you
with this candle

16:36.916 --> 16:39.351
- and your super weird body.
- No..

16:39.419 --> 16:40.786
Bye, Rafi.

16:43.156 --> 16:45.023
I got this.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.659
Hell Reservation for Ruxin.

16:47.727 --> 16:50.696
And, um, where is Mr. Raxin?

16:50.763 --> 16:52.431
Oh, Mr.<i> Ruxin</i>
is right here.

16:52.498 --> 16:53.865
Oh, Rodney.

16:55.468 --> 16:56.902
Wha...
Oh, my God,

16:56.969 --> 16:58.704
are you kidding me, Andre?

16:58.771 --> 17:01.540
Here he is, right here.
Mr. Rodney Ruxin.

17:01.607 --> 17:03.642
Everybody calls me Ruspin.

17:03.710 --> 17:05.609
So... should we
go to Uno's?

17:05.678 --> 17:08.512
Yeah, deep dish tonight.
No, guys, I put on a dress.

17:08.580 --> 17:10.816
- You're Mr. Raxin?
- Rux.

17:10.883 --> 17:12.917
Yup. Pete has sex
with Kevin all thee.

17:12.984 --> 17:15.087
Forever not clean.

17:15.089 --> 17:16.121
Shut up.

17:16.189 --> 17:17.489
Uh, Mr. Raxin, I'm afraid

17:17.589 --> 17:19.391
I'm going to have to see
some identification.

17:19.459 --> 17:20.659
Um...

17:20.727 --> 17:21.926
Driver's license?

17:21.993 --> 17:24.329
A valid driver's license?

17:24.396 --> 17:26.031
Would an Illinois driver's license

17:26.098 --> 17:27.531
or a black AmEx be preferable?

17:27.599 --> 17:29.034
Oh, my God.

17:29.102 --> 17:30.869
Oh, this is my good friend Taco.

17:30.937 --> 17:33.805
Shut up, no, this
is Rodney Ruxin.

17:33.873 --> 17:35.741
My law firm, Hudabega,
Hudabega & Bethesda

17:35.808 --> 17:37.109
has done some work

17:37.176 --> 17:39.144
for your restaurant.

17:39.212 --> 17:41.513
Mr. Raxin, it's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

17:41.581 --> 17:44.282
Sidarra, please seat
these fine young people.

17:44.350 --> 17:47.119
Yes. Let's eat.
Oh, sweet, I'm starving.

17:47.186 --> 17:49.054
Did any of you know it was me?

17:49.122 --> 17:50.355
And Mr. Raxin's wife?

17:50.423 --> 17:53.525
Oh. Turns out she <i> is</i> dead. Mm.

17:53.593 --> 17:55.994
<i>All right, Kevin,</i>

17:56.062 --> 17:57.896
you got the scores--
who's going to the playoffs?

17:57.964 --> 17:59.965
Guys, don't worry, I have
all the fantasy news

18:00.032 --> 18:01.767
that is fit to print.
All right.

18:01.834 --> 18:03.535
If you'll raise your glass.

18:03.603 --> 18:06.405
I am in the DraftKings
world championships.

18:06.472 --> 18:08.874
No, no, no. Unmentionable.
Oh, boo. Come on.

18:08.941 --> 18:10.375
Please.
No on gives a shit.

18:10.443 --> 18:12.244
Everyone here should give
a shit, and you should, too.

18:12.311 --> 18:14.045
Really?
Remember the bet we made about

18:14.113 --> 18:16.481
- who would be happiest at
the end of this season? - Mm-hmm.

18:16.549 --> 18:17.816
Well, I'm feeling happy because

18:17.884 --> 18:19.718
I'm in the running
for a million dollars.

18:19.786 --> 18:21.119
Pete, money doesn't
buy you happiness.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.888
Take it from me--
I'm a very rich man.

18:22.955 --> 18:24.990
And excruciatingly unhappy.

18:25.057 --> 18:26.525
I am a single man

18:26.592 --> 18:28.260
with endless possibilities.
I mean, who knows

18:28.327 --> 18:30.562
what's right around the corner for me.
All we care about

18:30.630 --> 18:33.070
- is who is in the playoffs.
It's Tuesday night, Kevin. - Yes.

18:33.132 --> 18:35.200
Tell us the standings.
Ooh, yeah. What do we got?

18:35.268 --> 18:37.836
Come on, baby. Come on.
Okay. Bam. Check it out.

18:37.904 --> 18:39.070
Ooh.
Yeah. Come on.

18:39.138 --> 18:40.605
I got 67? Nice.

18:40.673 --> 18:43.475
What?
Babe, you lost to pocket change.

18:43.543 --> 18:45.010
No, no, no-- we have a tie.
What does that mean

18:45.077 --> 18:46.411
for the playoffs?
I know. I haven't figured out

18:46.479 --> 18:47.779
all the tiebreaker scenarios.
What do you mean

18:47.847 --> 18:49.948
you haven't figured out
how the tiebreakers work?

18:50.016 --> 18:51.750
It's got something
to do with your record versus

18:51.818 --> 18:52.717
- the other person's record.
Points for and points against. - Oh, my God.

18:52.785 --> 18:54.152
Come on, this is bullshit.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.887
How do we know you're not
making these numbers up?

18:55.955 --> 18:57.656
I worked very hard
on these numbers.

18:57.723 --> 18:58.890
That's not an answer, Kevin.

18:58.958 --> 19:00.392
Ruxin, I fell asleep at my desk.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.961
Still not an answer.
Show your work.

19:03.029 --> 19:04.162
You want to see how
the sausage is made?

19:04.230 --> 19:05.397
Here it is.

19:05.465 --> 19:07.165
Have at it.
Hey,

19:07.233 --> 19:09.234
I didn't play Robbie Gould
as my kicker.

19:09.302 --> 19:10.368
You did it one time.

19:10.436 --> 19:11.937
Is this even my team?

19:12.004 --> 19:13.505
I'm honestly asking.
I don't...

19:13.573 --> 19:14.733
Wait, wait, wait--
C. Johnson?

19:14.740 --> 19:15.841
I wanted Calvin Johnson.

19:15.908 --> 19:17.442
You put in Chris Johnson?

19:17.510 --> 19:18.743
I'm sorry, I couldn't
read your mind.

19:18.811 --> 19:20.111
You know what's so
interesting about this

19:20.179 --> 19:21.546
is that I'm gonna
be a millionaire.

19:21.614 --> 19:24.983
Wait, what is this?

19:25.051 --> 19:26.284
Chalupa helped me
with some of the math.

19:26.352 --> 19:27.252
Oh, boy.
He knows what he's doing

19:27.320 --> 19:29.621
and I was in the weeds.

19:29.689 --> 19:30.849
This does not stand, okay?
No.

19:30.890 --> 19:33.124
No, this is bullshit.
And my win stands.

19:33.192 --> 19:34.593
Fine. Like all good
commissioners, I knew

19:34.660 --> 19:37.229
that you would say this,
so I came up with a plan B.

19:37.296 --> 19:39.331
Okay, what is it?
Tell 'em... tell 'em what the plan B is, babe.

19:39.398 --> 19:40.832
Plan B is this:

19:40.900 --> 19:43.802
all this bullshit
goes out the window.

19:43.870 --> 19:47.472
Whew.
We start completely fresh, okay?

19:47.540 --> 19:49.941
Everyone is in the playoffs.

19:50.009 --> 19:52.477
Highest score wins The Shiva,

19:52.545 --> 19:54.880
lowest score gets The Sacko.

19:54.947 --> 19:56.548
Thunderdome style.

19:56.616 --> 19:58.283
I guess I would prefer
to beat all of you

19:58.351 --> 19:59.784
than just one of you.
Right?

19:59.852 --> 20:02.220
This is bullshit.
I lost fair and square.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.356
I got shit to do next week.

20:04.423 --> 20:07.792
Can we all agree, please?
A one-week, all-in Shiva Bowl.

20:07.860 --> 20:08.960
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.

20:09.028 --> 20:10.128
Great, good.
Settled.

20:10.196 --> 20:11.162
Yeah, but we should
seal the deal

20:11.230 --> 20:12.497
by paying our respects.

20:12.565 --> 20:14.566
But we don't have The Dre.

20:14.634 --> 20:16.301
We've got something much better.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.074

20:25.978 --> 20:30.700
Oh, bless me, Shiva.

20:32.470 --> 20:34.071
You're better
than a million bucks.

20:34.138 --> 20:37.441
Shiva Komedi, I'm gonna put
my weenie in your pagini.

20:37.508 --> 20:39.476
Visualize it.

20:39.544 --> 20:41.545
Not close enough.

20:43.214 --> 20:45.082
Move, bozo.

20:45.149 --> 20:47.717
Out of here. A little respect.
What? Hey.

20:50.655 --> 20:54.088
Ruxin. Ruxin, you're
fogging up the glass.

20:56.659 --> 20:59.107
How was dinner, sir?
Absolutely fantastic.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.809
I actually would like
to make a reservation...

21:00.876 --> 21:01.741
No.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.912
Hi, Andre.

21:03.979 --> 21:05.113
Hey. Meegan.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.614
What are you doing here?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.802
It's the biggest opening in
Chicago. Wouldn't miss it.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.819
How are you...
how are you doing?

21:10.886 --> 21:12.487
Pretty good.

21:12.555 --> 21:14.389
Oh.
Whoa.

21:14.457 --> 21:16.224
She got fat.

21:16.292 --> 21:17.291
Wow.

21:18.399 --> 21:19.988
Or pregnant, taco.

21:20.331 --> 21:21.001
Oh.

21:21.121 --> 21:23.228
I really just won that bet.
