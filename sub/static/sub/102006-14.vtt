11:33.101 --> 11:35.509
(both exhale)

11:35.529 --> 11:36.528
I know you're tired.

11:36.755 --> 11:38.846
Um, but I just wanted to say...

11:38.940 --> 11:39.939
I'm sorry.

11:40.091 --> 11:41.348
I overreacted.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.775
I should have let you know
what was going on

11:42.928 --> 11:45.352
instead of trying
to prove some point.

11:45.447 --> 11:46.946
I'm sorry, too.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.282
I mean, the whole thing
seems so silly now.

11:49.434 --> 11:51.859
I never should have tailed you
like a suspect.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.545
(laughs)

11:55.364 --> 11:57.290
Hmm.

11:57.442 --> 12:00.201
You know, after I was attacked,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.962
we never really talked about it.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.615
Well, I always got the sense
you didn't want to.

12:05.633 --> 12:06.799
No, I mean...

12:06.968 --> 12:10.145
we never talked about
what it was like for you.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.548
There's that thing people say--

12:14.568 --> 12:16.401
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

12:16.628 --> 12:17.885
Mm.

12:18.129 --> 12:21.631
Because losing someone you love
is such an alien concept.

12:21.649 --> 12:24.300
You don't want to imagine
what it's like.

12:24.319 --> 12:26.302
Well, those people
are not like us.

12:26.395 --> 12:29.155
And I was sitting
in that engine thinking

12:29.307 --> 12:31.491
I was listening to you dying.

12:31.643 --> 12:33.567
And I didn't
need to imagine anything.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.236
I knew what my life
would feel like

12:35.330 --> 12:36.704
without you in it,
and it scared me.

12:36.831 --> 12:39.549
I'm sorry I put you
through that.

12:41.244 --> 12:43.486
I know you were doing your job.

12:43.505 --> 12:46.080
And I'm proud of you for that,
but there is a small selfish

12:46.174 --> 12:48.266
part of me that wishes
you didn't want to anymore.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.326
(laughs)

12:50.345 --> 12:52.178
I didn't.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.847
No, after the attack
and everything else

12:54.941 --> 12:56.775
going on in the world?

12:56.926 --> 12:58.926
The last thing
I wanted to do was ever

12:58.945 --> 13:01.521
put that uniform on again.

13:01.673 --> 13:04.357
And then Elaine
brought up retirement.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.677
And I really did struggle
with that decision.

13:07.695 --> 13:09.621
Why didn't you tell me
about that so I could help you

13:09.848 --> 13:11.605
-through it?
-Because I knew
what you would do.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.274
You would support me.

13:13.368 --> 13:16.628
Give me permission to quit.

13:17.613 --> 13:19.756
And I couldn't.

13:23.378 --> 13:26.045
-Couldn't let the bad guys win.
-Mm-mm.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.454
(chuckles)

13:27.549 --> 13:29.549
That's who you are.

13:29.701 --> 13:30.883
You're a survivor.

13:31.036 --> 13:33.686
We're survivors.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.066
CARLA:
Good morning!

13:47.218 --> 13:49.977
Oh, are we still in our pajamas?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.996
School starts in 20 minutes.

13:52.223 --> 13:53.665
Sorry, that's-that's my fault.

13:53.816 --> 13:56.334
-Slept through the alarm.
-Oh, no, that's good--

13:56.485 --> 13:58.077
that means
you're getting some sleep.

13:58.229 --> 14:01.488
-Ah.
-Buck snores loud.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.675
-(chuckles)
-Well, that's also good to know.

14:03.902 --> 14:05.176
Okay. I, uh...

14:05.328 --> 14:07.570
I think it's time
someone got ready for school.

14:07.589 --> 14:10.331
I'll go.
But I'm gonna need a nap later.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.077
-(chuckles)
-Because of all the snoring.

14:14.095 --> 14:16.980
-Yes. Okay.
-(Carla laughs)

14:17.858 --> 14:19.432
(grunts)

14:19.584 --> 14:21.434
Oh, my goodness.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.527
(chuckles softly)

14:22.754 --> 14:25.071
He seems to be doing okay.

14:26.682 --> 14:27.607
Y...

14:27.701 --> 14:30.869
You think he understands
what's going on?

14:31.705 --> 14:33.354
Boy's already lost his mother.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.498
I think he understands
more than we'd like him to.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.193
Now, what about you?

14:39.212 --> 14:42.338
I mean, how is it
being back out there?

14:43.032 --> 14:44.941
It's weird.

14:45.034 --> 14:46.776
You know, the...

14:46.794 --> 14:49.295
team feels off without Eddie.

14:49.447 --> 14:52.539
Not what I was asking about.

14:52.634 --> 14:55.226
-I'm really worried
about you being out there.
-I'm, uh...

14:55.378 --> 14:57.020
I'm fine.

14:58.289 --> 15:00.481
I'm not the one who got shot.

15:13.062 --> 15:15.396
Williams, you're with us.

15:15.490 --> 15:16.563
What's going on?!

15:16.658 --> 15:18.750
We didn't ask for cops!
Our buddy's hurt!

15:18.901 --> 15:21.068
Gentlemen, the police are here
just as a precaution.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.569
-The sniper.
-You've got a man
pinned by a cable

15:22.664 --> 15:24.405
-up there?
-Don't know how the hell
the cable

15:24.499 --> 15:26.758
came unseated, but it's got that
on the end of it.

15:26.909 --> 15:28.575
There's at least a couple
thousand pounds of pressure

15:28.595 --> 15:30.929
on his arm.
You can see it on the feed.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.989
All right, take us there.

15:33.007 --> 15:34.581
-Poor Cliff, huh?
-Yeah.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.061

it's taking his arm with him.

15:45.261 --> 15:47.445
HEN:
Ooh. An arterial bleed, Cap.

15:47.596 --> 15:49.263
With travel time,
he's got eight minutes.

15:49.357 --> 15:51.357
Maybe ten.
It's pretty high up his arm.

15:51.509 --> 15:53.009
-He could bleed out quick.
-WILLIAMS: I talked to SWAT.

15:53.027 --> 15:54.235

-to make yourself a target.
-Yeah.

No. No, I was just the guy
standing there when it happened

20:59.484 --> 21:01.834

to protect him.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.335

<i> That was it?</i>

21:26.953 --> 21:28.119

some kind of weird

21:28.270 --> 21:29.678
reverse psychology thing.

21:29.772 --> 21:31.680
Think I prefer it

21:31.699 --> 21:33.774
Oh, I could yell at you
if you think that would help.

21:33.868 --> 21:36.685
Oh, come on, you can't be mad.
You weren't even there.

21:36.779 --> 21:38.320
There's at least half a dozen
videos on the Internet

21:38.372 --> 21:39.780
of your climb up that crane.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.115
All taken from nearby windows.
Any one of those people

21:42.135 --> 21:46.028
could have had a gun and shot
at your big, stupid head.

21:46.047 --> 21:47.555
I was wearing a helmet.

21:49.383 --> 21:52.034
Not made of Kevlar, dumbass.

21:52.053 --> 21:54.219
Hold on a second.
It almost sounds

21:54.314 --> 21:56.038
like you were worried about me.

21:56.131 --> 21:57.315
I'm annoyed with you.

21:57.466 --> 22:00.967
You're not invincible.
You could've gotten hurt.

22:01.062 --> 22:02.044
Or worse.

22:02.137 --> 22:04.363
But I didn't.

22:14.559 --> 22:17.393
Sorry.

22:17.486 --> 22:19.337

22:19.564 --> 22:20.987

22:21.082 --> 22:23.490
Not sure where that came from.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.251

22:26.346 --> 22:29.680

Appreciate you staying with him.

23:31.393 --> 23:33.819
Carla offered to bring him
to her house,

23:33.971 --> 23:35.638
but, uh, I figured

23:35.731 --> 23:36.822
this was overwhelming enough

23:36.916 --> 23:39.125
without having to sleep
in a strange bed.

23:39.994 --> 23:41.827
He doing okay?

23:41.979 --> 23:42.920
Better than me.

23:43.147 --> 23:45.648
(chuckles)
Uh...

23:46.817 --> 23:50.744
I kind of lost it
when I told him you got shot.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.746
I-I'm sorry.
I should've

23:52.765 --> 23:54.657
held it together.

23:54.675 --> 23:57.768
You were there for him
when I couldn't be.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.679
That's what matters.

24:00.831 --> 24:02.606
Still.

24:02.833 --> 24:04.667
I think it might have
been better for him

24:04.760 --> 24:06.735
if I was the one who got shot.

24:11.284 --> 24:14.343
I heard the ballistics report
from our shell casings came in.

24:14.361 --> 24:16.436
(chuckles)
They didn't send a report.

24:16.456 --> 24:19.039
They sent him.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.019
Chief Pate.

24:24.038 --> 24:26.088
Sergeant.

24:26.949 --> 24:28.674
Close the door.

24:34.289 --> 24:36.699
The casing you found

24:36.717 --> 24:39.051
was from a .308-caliber round.

24:39.203 --> 24:40.811
Fits what a sniper would use.

24:41.038 --> 24:42.538
And matches the slugs
from both scenes.

24:42.631 --> 24:46.208
But none of that brings a deputy
chief to deliver the news.

24:46.301 --> 24:48.134
The ammunition was match grade.

24:48.229 --> 24:49.970
More accurate, more expensive

24:50.064 --> 24:52.973
and much more traceable.
Down to the lot number.

24:53.067 --> 24:55.159
Ballistics reached out
to the manufacturer

24:55.386 --> 24:56.568
to identify the purchaser.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.404
Then they called me.

24:59.557 --> 25:03.075
So our sniper didn't get
his ammo from a gun shop.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.911
He got it from us.

25:06.063 --> 25:09.673
That bullet belongs to the LAPD.

25:18.259 --> 25:21.560

27:01.028 --> 27:04.179
and what I see when you're here,

27:04.198 --> 27:06.106
it feels like something more
