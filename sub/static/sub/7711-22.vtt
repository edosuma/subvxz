WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:02.436
[sighs]
Bleaah!

00:02.470 --> 00:04.038
Okay, where does it hurt?

00:04.072 --> 00:06.240
Just...all over.

00:06.274 --> 00:08.709
I...don't want
to do anything.

00:08.742 --> 00:09.710
I'm dying.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.112
No, that's not
how it works.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.046
You have to point
to a specific part

00:12.080 --> 00:13.347
of the body.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.816
Right there.

00:15.849 --> 00:16.784
(Dwight)
"Abdomen."

00:16.817 --> 00:19.153
"Menses."
Maybe.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.355
"The uterus contracts after
your egg passes through it."

00:21.389 --> 00:22.723
Not it.
I don't have eggs.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.392
So when did this start?

00:24.425 --> 00:25.759
About ten minutes ago.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.295
When I came in
with the paperwork?

00:27.328 --> 00:28.296
Mm-hmm.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.764
About 40 times a year,
Michael gets really sick,

00:30.798 --> 00:33.067
but has no symptoms.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.503
Dwight is always
gravely concerned.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.139
(Dwight)
Ooh, is it possible
you ate food

00:38.172 --> 00:39.407
that contained
animal waste?

00:39.440 --> 00:40.808
It's possible.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.410
(Pam)
Michael?
Huh?

00:42.443 --> 00:43.777
David Wallace
is on line one.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.413
You see a phone?

00:45.446 --> 00:46.547
Oh.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.116
All right,
everybody out.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.450
Out, out, out.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.784
Okay...

00:50.818 --> 00:53.321
To what do I owe this
great honor, David Wallace?

00:53.354 --> 00:54.855
[David on speakerphone]
Michael, I am calling--

00:54.888 --> 00:57.158
And Gromit.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.092
[sighs]

00:58.126 --> 00:59.527
Jan?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.162
Is Jan there?

01:01.195 --> 01:02.830
Jan is out of town
right now.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.099
Oh, you sigh like Jan.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.334
[sighs]

01:06.367 --> 01:08.802
I broke Jan's heart, David,
and I feel awful.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.471
It was--

01:10.504 --> 01:13.741
It was never my intention
to ruin a life.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.809
But you know what?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.845
Sometimes...
Michael?

01:17.878 --> 01:20.581
you just gots
to get your freak on.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.582
Michael?
Yeah?

01:21.615 --> 01:23.151
Michael?
Hmm?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.619
I'm calling to see
if you would come down

01:25.653 --> 01:27.221
and interview for a job

01:27.255 --> 01:28.756
we have opening up
in corporate.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.658
Really?

01:30.691 --> 01:31.859
A week from today.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.328
Bring your first-quarter stats
and your recommendation

01:34.362 --> 01:36.130
for who'd take over
the Scranton branch.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.865
Wow.
Mm-hmm.

01:37.898 --> 01:41.335
I wish I had prepared
something to say.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.336
That's not necessary.

01:42.370 --> 01:46.840
May God guide you
in your quest.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.409
Yes.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.844
[cheerful music]

01:50.878 --> 01:58.319
*

02:20.641 --> 02:22.676
Okay, everybody have
their towels

02:22.710 --> 02:25.213
and swimsuits?

02:25.246 --> 02:26.647
We have about
an hour and a half.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.516
I suggest that
you all go potty now.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.783
And then we will
be congregating

02:29.817 --> 02:31.519
on the par-tay bus.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.554
Oh, I'm excited--
today is beach day.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.888
Michael is taking
the whole office

02:34.922 --> 02:35.923
to the beach.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.959
So I'm wearing my bathing suit
underneath my shirt.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.763
Oh, yeah, I packed it
in my purse.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.598
Oscar, you brought
your Speedo, I assume?

02:44.632 --> 02:46.200
I don't wear a Speedo,
Michael.

02:46.234 --> 02:49.203
Well, you can't swim
in leather pants.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.871
Ha ha ha.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.773
I'm just yankin'
your chain.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.308
Not literally.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.809
Anybody need sunblock?

02:55.843 --> 02:56.944
It's got an SPF 30.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.812
Oh, you know what?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.781
Uh, you're not going.

03:00.814 --> 03:01.982
It's beach day.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.218
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, Toby.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.286
We, um--

03:05.319 --> 03:07.488
Somebody has to stay here.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.558
I want today to be
a beautiful memory

03:10.591 --> 03:13.894
that the staff and I share
after I have passed on

03:13.927 --> 03:15.863
to New York.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.899
And if Toby is
a part of it...

03:18.932 --> 03:20.801
then it'll suck.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.936
Hey...

03:22.970 --> 03:24.472
want my sunscreen?

03:24.505 --> 03:25.873
Oh, great.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.642
I forgot mine,
and I'm wearing a two-piece.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.378
Ahh.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.413
Thanks, Toby.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.949
Hey, Pam,

03:35.983 --> 03:38.319
I have a very important job
for you today.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.987
I thought we were just
having fun at the beach.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.389
We, are, we are.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.957
But I would like you
to take notes.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.794
And I want you to find out
about people's character.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.930
You know,
not their hotness, per se,

03:49.963 --> 03:53.334
but their humor
and their charisma.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.903
And the indefinable quality

03:55.936 --> 03:58.339
that makes you all glad
to follow me.

03:58.372 --> 04:01.875
What happens to a company
if somebody takes a boss away?

04:01.909 --> 04:04.612
I will answer your question
with a question.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.915
It's like what happens
to a chicken...

04:07.948 --> 04:09.950
when you take
its head away.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.320
It dies.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.656
Unless you find a new head.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.058
I need to see
which one of these people

04:18.091 --> 04:22.630
have the skills
to be a chicken head.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.633
You want me to write down
people's indefinable qualities?

04:25.666 --> 04:26.700
I want you to write down
everything

04:26.734 --> 04:28.436
that people are doing
all day,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.838
and then type it up
in a way that is helpful.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.473
All right?

04:32.506 --> 04:34.875
I have the most boring job
in the office,

04:34.908 --> 04:37.678
so why wouldn't I have
the most boring job

04:37.711 --> 04:39.046
on beach day?

04:39.079 --> 04:43.351
This way
to the par-tay bus.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.585
I just want to lie
on the beach

04:44.618 --> 04:46.887
and eat hot dogs.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.722
That's all I've ever wanted.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.759
* And the night got
deathly quiet *

04:51.792 --> 04:54.862
* And his face lost
all expression *

04:54.895 --> 04:57.831
* Said if you're gonna
play the game, boy *

04:57.865 --> 05:00.801
* You gotta learn
to play it right *

05:00.834 --> 05:04.872
(all)
* You got to know
when to hold 'em *

05:04.905 --> 05:08.075
* Know when to fold 'em

05:08.108 --> 05:11.044
* Know when to walk away

05:11.078 --> 05:12.980
* And know when to run

05:13.013 --> 05:15.549
* You never count
your money *

05:15.583 --> 05:16.750
Uh-huh.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.820
* When you're sitting
at the table *

05:19.853 --> 05:24.392
* There'll be time enough
for counting *

05:24.425 --> 05:28.362
* When the dealin's done

05:28.396 --> 05:31.098
Everybody, may I have
your attention, please?

05:31.131 --> 05:36.770
Today we are not just
spending a day at the beach.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.906
Oh, sweet mother
of God.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.441
If you don't like it,
Stanley,

05:40.474 --> 05:42.075
you can go to the back
of the bus.
Excuse me?

05:42.109 --> 05:45.112
Or the front of the bus,
or drive the bus.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.815
Just--

05:47.848 --> 05:52.653
We are all participating
in mandatory fun activities.

05:53.921 --> 05:54.955
Funtivities!

05:54.988 --> 05:58.058
And there is a special
secret prize for the winner.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.693
Yes, funtivities!

05:59.727 --> 06:01.061
I knew it wasn't
just a trip to the beach.

06:01.094 --> 06:01.962
Okay, you know what?

06:01.995 --> 06:04.398
Your enthusiasm
is turning people off.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.099
I hope there will be
management parables.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.100
Well...

06:07.134 --> 06:08.969
[whispering]
Hey, Pam,

06:09.002 --> 06:10.471
did you get that down?

06:10.504 --> 06:11.472
Like what?

06:11.505 --> 06:13.841
Like everything I said,
and everything they did.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.108
Just don't--
Well, no.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.877
Write it down before
you forget it.
I don't remember exactly--

06:16.910 --> 06:17.978
That's--

06:18.011 --> 06:20.047
You've just been
drawing pictures.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.483
Rrrrr-rrrrr!

06:22.516 --> 06:24.051
I can't stay mad
at you.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.687
(Michael)
Here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.055
Everybody ready?

06:28.088 --> 06:30.724
Last one down is
a rotten egg!

06:30.758 --> 06:34.895
Watch out for snakes.

06:34.928 --> 06:35.996
Everybody put on sunscreen.
All right...

06:36.029 --> 06:37.865
find a cozy spot.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.600
Everybody settle in.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.674
Okay, everybody up.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.042
Circle around.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.611
Let us play some games.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.781
We are situated
on the northeast corner

06:53.814 --> 06:56.484
of scenic Lake Scranton.

06:56.517 --> 07:00.220
America's eight largest
indigenous body of water.

07:00.253 --> 07:04.558
It is here that a group
of Americans

07:04.592 --> 07:06.827
will undergo
the ultimate challenge.

07:06.860 --> 07:11.465
One day, 14 strangers
who work together--

07:11.499 --> 07:12.766
but only one survivor.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.967
What?!

07:14.001 --> 07:16.804
Just words--
inspiring words.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.005
Not a contender.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.474
For the competitions,
you will be divided

07:20.508 --> 07:21.842
into four tribes.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.577
Each tribe will have
a leader

07:23.611 --> 07:25.846
that I will pick randomly
off the top of my head

07:25.879 --> 07:26.847
without thinking.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.584
Jim, Dwight, Andy,
and Stanley.

07:30.618 --> 07:31.952
Yes!
Choose your tribes.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.988
Except for Pam.
Not Pam.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.690
Jim Halpert.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.658
Karen.
(Michael)
Pros:

07:37.691 --> 07:42.062
smart, cool,
good looking.

07:42.095 --> 07:45.265
Remind you of anybody
you know?

07:45.298 --> 07:48.035
Cons:
not a hard worker.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.738
I can spend all day
on a project,

07:50.771 --> 07:52.005
and he will finish
the same project

07:52.039 --> 07:53.574
in a half an hour.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.042
So that should
tell you something.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.744
I choose Michael!

07:56.777 --> 07:58.879
I'm not playing.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.714
Okay, temp.

08:00.748 --> 08:04.752
Dwight is an obvious candidate
for my job.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.287
He has the best sales record
in the office.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.223
He loves the work.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.760
He is, however,
an idiot.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.895
We are going to choose
team names--Dwight.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.564
We will be called
Gryffindor.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.931
Really?
Not Slytherin?

08:17.965 --> 08:19.633
Slytherin are
the bad guys, Jim.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.668
I know.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.103
Okay, we will be
Voldemort.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.772
He who must not
be named?

08:24.805 --> 08:25.939
I wouldn't do that.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.641
Voldemort.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.610
Okay, seriously...
Voldemort!

08:29.643 --> 08:31.078
(all)
Voldemort, Voldemort...
You really shouldn't be say--

08:31.111 --> 08:32.312
Hey, hey, hey.
Voldemort.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.047
Voldemort!
Idiots!

08:34.081 --> 08:36.116
Okay, okay, Stanley,
your team name.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.985
I don't care
what you call my team.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.120
Then I will name your team
the red team.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.122
No, the blue team.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.958
I am also considering Stanley,

08:44.992 --> 08:48.896
because of all the good
that black people have done

08:48.929 --> 08:51.198
for America.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.066
We will be team U.S.A.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.134
Very good.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.670
Pam, please take a note
that Andy is patriotic.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.606
Andy Bernard.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.709
Pros:
he's classy, he gets me.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.011
He went to Cornell.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.679
I trust him.

09:05.713 --> 09:09.216
Cons:
I don't really trust him.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.152
It is time for the great
spoon and egg race.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.721
This one is with
a little twist.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.122
There's already a twist.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.324
You're carrying an egg
on a spoon.
Shh.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.260
The person carrying the egg
will be blindfolded.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.729
Please put on
your blindfolds.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.030
That person
carrying the egg

09:23.063 --> 09:25.132
will go down, circle a torch,
come back,

09:25.165 --> 09:27.701
deposit their egg
in the pail.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.002
First team back
is the winner.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.706
All right, ready,
set, go!

09:32.740 --> 09:35.342
Come on, Phyllis,
you can do it.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.377
Thank you so much.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.747
Phyllis is out, yes!
Follow my voice.

09:39.780 --> 09:43.150
(Andy)
Yeah, keep it moving,
keep it moving right this way.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.217
Looking good, whoo!

09:44.251 --> 09:45.352
I don't want to hit
the big rock.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.353
Don't worry,
you're not--

09:46.386 --> 09:47.287
I know I'm near
the big rock.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.222
I just know it.
Nowhere near the big rock.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.792
What are you doing?
No!

09:51.825 --> 09:52.760
[strained chuckle]

09:52.793 --> 09:55.062
See, now we're
disqualified.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.867
I am okay if I lose
every single contest today.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.869
Honestly.

10:01.902 --> 10:07.374
Because I see these contests
as an opportunity for me

10:07.407 --> 10:09.943
to demonstrate
what a good sport I am.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.745
Mallard.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.380
[duck quacks
and takes flight]

10:13.413 --> 10:14.414
Whoa, stop, stop, stop--
there's a hole.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.415
Just step over the hole.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.884
A hole?
Yep.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.752
(Dwight)
Come on, lazy bones, move it!

10:18.786 --> 10:20.721
Perfect.
Ooh, just made it.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.554
Okay, turn left.

10:21.588 --> 10:22.956
Come on, andale,
arriba, arriba.

10:22.990 --> 10:23.957
You have to stop this
right now,

10:23.991 --> 10:25.125
or I'm not gonna
do this anymore.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.794
What are you saying?

10:26.827 --> 10:28.028
You have to stop yelling at me,
or I'm not go do the egg race.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.296
Okay, I apologize
for yelling at you.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.664
That's what being
a good captain is about.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.332
I'm trying to bring
team spirit.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.734
Whoa, stop--
another hole.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.168
Take a big step.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.070
Yes!

10:37.104 --> 10:38.205
Oh, my God!

10:38.238 --> 10:39.840
You ass!

10:39.873 --> 10:41.709
[Jim and Karen laughing]

10:41.742 --> 10:43.677
There's nothing better than
a beautiful day at the beach,

10:43.711 --> 10:48.982
filled with sun, surf,
and, uh, diligent note taking.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.052
(Michael)
Pam, you're missing things.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.799
Let's go!
Let's go!

11:05.833 --> 11:07.434
Come on, mush!

11:07.467 --> 11:09.703
Mush!
Come on, you bastard!

11:09.737 --> 11:11.772
What the--

11:11.805 --> 11:12.906
Damn it, temp!

11:14.742 --> 11:15.876
Great job, everyone.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.311
That was fantastic.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.148
[sighs]

11:21.181 --> 11:24.117
Okay, Pam, I have another
little project for you.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.385
Does it have to do
with these shopping bags

11:25.418 --> 11:26.419
filled with hot dogs?

11:26.453 --> 11:27.420
Smart as a whip.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.790
Yes, these are precooked,

11:29.823 --> 11:31.224
so it's not absolutely
necessary,

11:31.258 --> 11:33.861
but I would appreciate it if
you could heat up 800 hot dogs

11:33.894 --> 11:35.929
for a little contest
I'm going to be having.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.798
I would greatly
appreciate it.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.799
When's the contest?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.400
Like, um,
ten minutes.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.403
How am I supposed to get--
Thanks a bunch.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.508
A good manager
has got to be hungry.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.377
Hungry for success.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.179
Okay, who's hungry?
No, no, no.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.514
Do not touch the food,
please, not yet.

11:54.547 --> 11:58.085
That is our next event--
a hot dog eating contest.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.053
[disappointed groans]
For those of you
who are curious,

12:00.087 --> 12:04.524
the world record
is 54 1/2 hot dogs.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.859
Wow!

12:05.893 --> 12:06.960
And you know what?

12:06.994 --> 12:08.996
I personally have
cooked up enough

12:09.029 --> 12:10.130
so that each
and every one of you

12:10.163 --> 12:11.464
could break that record.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.166
So shoot for the stars, okay?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.969
All right, the team that eats
the most hot dogs in ten minutes

12:16.003 --> 12:17.838
will be declared
the winner.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.040
On your mark,
get set--

12:20.073 --> 12:21.174
Can I have
a turkey burger?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.210
No, I have the only one.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.511
I claimed it.
Ready?

12:24.544 --> 12:25.913
(Oscar)
Turkey is a healthy meat.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.314
[all assenting]

12:27.347 --> 12:28.816
I don't eat meat, Michael.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.083
I'm not gonna eat this.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.785
Guys, guys, come on.

12:31.819 --> 12:34.187
Please, let's just--okay.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.356
It's very important
that you all try to eat

12:36.389 --> 12:38.091
as many hot dogs
as you can.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.794
On your mark, get set,

12:40.828 --> 12:41.895
eat!

12:41.929 --> 12:43.230
Is there any mustard?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.898
No mustard, no mustard.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.134
Just eat it--
eat it, Phyllis.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.401
Dip it in the water

12:48.435 --> 12:50.904
so it'll slide down
your gullet more easily.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.472
Come on, the winner gets
a big, big prize.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.808
What is it?
I can't say.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.476
You can't say,
or you can't pronounce it?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.478
The winner gets
a regional manager's salary

12:58.511 --> 13:00.881
for a year,
and a Sebring, and the feeling

13:00.914 --> 13:02.816
that they are making
a difference in the world.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.984
Can we just take
those first two things?

13:04.017 --> 13:06.486
The winner of today
gets my job.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.223
Okay?

13:10.257 --> 13:12.359
I'm interviewing for a job
at corporate.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.461
And they're only interviewing
a handful of people,

13:14.494 --> 13:17.497
and I'm the most qualified,
and I'll probably get it.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.498
All right?

13:18.531 --> 13:20.467
You're leaving?

13:20.500 --> 13:21.568
I didn't want
to tell anybody.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.471
I didn't want to cast a pall
over our fun beach day.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.406
But you know what,
I don't know who to recommend,

13:26.439 --> 13:28.108
because, frankly,
nobody is stepping up.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.944
I am so hungry!

13:30.978 --> 13:32.412
Do you expect me
to believe

13:32.445 --> 13:34.181
that you're truly
making your recommendations

13:34.214 --> 13:35.482
on this basis?

13:35.515 --> 13:37.184
Word.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.255
There we go.
Let's see it.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.024
I would rather work
for an upturned broom

13:44.057 --> 13:45.325
with a bucket for a head

13:45.358 --> 13:47.260
than work for somebody else
in this office

13:47.294 --> 13:48.929
besides myself.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.163
Game on.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.498
Four seconds,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.967
three, two, one.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.369
Stop!
No eating!

13:56.403 --> 13:58.605
And the winner is
Andy Bernard,

13:58.638 --> 14:01.942
with 14 hot dogs.
Team U.S.A.!

14:01.975 --> 14:02.943
One came up.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.377
13 hot dogs,
everybody.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.613
Damn it!

14:06.646 --> 14:08.848
Aw, nobody told me
we were gonna nave hot dogs.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.355
Sabotage.

14:15.388 --> 14:15.855
What?

14:15.889 --> 14:17.490
What are you saying?

14:17.524 --> 14:18.491
Did you say sandwich?

14:18.525 --> 14:20.227
No. I was saying that before.

14:20.260 --> 14:24.497
Not now. Now I am saying...
[dramatic whisper] Sabotage.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.635
The ancient Dutch art of
screwing up your own team.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.637
I knew you were
saying sabotage.

14:30.670 --> 14:34.041
I was giving you an
example of it.

14:34.074 --> 14:39.346
I will misunderstand everything
Andy says until he goes insane.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.382
If Michael organizes some kind
of group hug. Stand next to me.

14:42.415 --> 14:46.653
It's very simple,
there are only three rules.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.022
You must not touch
the ground,

14:49.056 --> 14:51.491
you must not step outside
of the ring,

14:51.524 --> 14:55.528
and you must always wear
the safety mittens.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.397
What safety mittens?
We don't have
any safety mittens.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.698
I probably left them
in the trunk of my car.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.033
It's all right,
here we go.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.935
Go get 'em, big boy!

15:01.969 --> 15:04.938
And go!

15:04.972 --> 15:06.006
(Karen)
Come on, Jim!

15:06.039 --> 15:07.174
Rrrrrrrrrrr!

15:07.207 --> 15:08.175
Whoa,
what are you doing?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.610
Come on!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

15:10.643 --> 15:12.212
[cheering]

15:12.245 --> 15:13.546
(Michael)
Nice, Stanley!

15:13.580 --> 15:15.448
Sorry about that.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.384
It's all about taking points
away from Dwight.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.519
Yeah, no, good, okay.

15:19.552 --> 15:23.423
Oh, my God...
I have never seen that look

15:23.456 --> 15:25.692
in a man's eyes ever.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.396
I thought that
I might die.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.199
On beach day.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.868
Come on!
Come on!

15:35.902 --> 15:39.439
(Oscar)
If either of these guys
are put in charge of the office,

15:39.472 --> 15:40.640
I will transfer to Albany.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.142
Gil can come if he wants.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.276
I'm kind of looking
for a way out

15:43.310 --> 15:44.511
of that relationship anyway.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.314
I think I might try girls
for a while.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.649
Angela thinks
I can cross over.

15:49.682 --> 15:50.683
We'll see.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.485
Aah!

15:52.519 --> 15:53.686
One, two, three!

15:53.720 --> 15:56.056
Yeah! Yeah!

15:56.089 --> 15:57.124
(Michael)
Excellent.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.558
Gryffindor!

15:58.591 --> 16:00.660
Gryffindor!

16:00.693 --> 16:02.762
I didn't win.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.631
But the only reason
I didn't win is

16:04.664 --> 16:06.599
because I recently learned
that it's better

16:06.633 --> 16:08.301
to work things out
with words.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.736
That's not why
you lost.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.204
Yeah, it is.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.639
I totally could have
kicked your butt so bad.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.574
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, right!

16:14.607 --> 16:16.476
Yeah, right.
Come on!

16:16.509 --> 16:20.013
Unh!
Unh!

16:20.047 --> 16:21.748
Aah!

16:21.781 --> 16:22.982
How do you like that?!

16:33.293 --> 16:35.095
Oh, God--

16:35.128 --> 16:37.797
Aah! Help!

16:37.830 --> 16:39.632
Help!

16:39.666 --> 16:41.768
Angela--
Angela, hey!

16:41.801 --> 16:44.437
Oh, thank God.
Go tell somebody.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.406
What, Andy?

16:46.439 --> 16:47.674
Andy,
what should I tell them?

16:47.707 --> 16:50.143
Go tell them
I'm floating away, obviously!

16:50.177 --> 16:52.612
I don't understand
what you want from me.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.681
Angela,
it's pretty simple.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.817
Look at what I'm doing,
and go tell somebody it!

16:57.850 --> 17:00.387
Sorry.
Aah--

17:00.420 --> 17:02.322
Bye, Andy.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.690
Angela!

17:03.723 --> 17:06.626
I knew that finding a successor
would be difficult.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.662
I did not know that
it would be impossible.

17:09.696 --> 17:13.200
Thus far, the candidates
have been wildly disappointing.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.268
Uh, Jim is not
taking it seriously,

17:15.302 --> 17:17.337
uh, Stanley
is having a stroke,

17:17.370 --> 17:18.738
and Andy--where is he?

17:18.771 --> 17:20.640
Where the hell is Andy?

17:20.673 --> 17:22.675
Where is he, Pam?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.311
Do you know?

17:24.344 --> 17:25.545
[sighs]

17:25.578 --> 17:26.546
Who's ahead in points?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.181
I think they're even.

17:28.215 --> 17:31.218
At various times,
you gave Jim ten points,

17:31.251 --> 17:34.521
Dwight a gold star,
and Stanley a thumbs up.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.356
And I don't really know how
to compare those units.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.391
Well, check to see
if there's a conversion chart

17:38.425 --> 17:39.426
in that notebook.

17:39.459 --> 17:42.629
I really doubt it, Michael.
Please just check.

17:42.662 --> 17:43.630
Great.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.465
Yeah, I'll see you
next week.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.466
Thank you.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.800
And here is
Karen Filipelli.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.170
Bye.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.638
Hello?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.773
Yeah, hi, David.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.708
Yes, I would like
to be considered

17:55.742 --> 17:57.144
for the corporate position
in well.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.845
"In well?"
As well.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.581
How would that work--
in well?

18:01.614 --> 18:03.550
I just want to know.
Yes, uh-huh.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.585
Wait a minute...
That would be fine.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.686
this job is in a well.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.288
I don't want it.
Cut it out!

18:08.321 --> 18:09.656
I don't.

18:09.689 --> 18:14.361
What does a great manager need
most of all?

18:14.394 --> 18:15.362
Courage.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.697
How so?

18:17.730 --> 18:20.200
I mean, sure thing,
that sounds smart.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.534
I can't do this anymore.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.536
I'm going to sit
in the bus.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.638
Your loss, Stanley.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.741
Meanwhile, the rest of us
will have a super-fun time

18:28.775 --> 18:30.710
defeating our fear,

18:30.743 --> 18:32.845
and creating
a lasting memory...

18:32.879 --> 18:37.617
walking through fire!

18:37.650 --> 18:39.652
[fire crackling]

18:40.520 --> 18:43.756
Who among you has the guts
to replace me?

18:43.790 --> 18:48.228
Let him walk across
these coals.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.700
Are you gonna try it?
No.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.701
I'm not gonna walk
in a fire

18:54.734 --> 18:56.803
after your disgusting feet
have gone through.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.307
Angela, it is
a million degrees.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.442
I'm gonna do it.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.577
And I fully expect
to burn my feet

19:04.611 --> 19:06.213
and go to the hospital.

19:06.246 --> 19:10.683
That's the right spirit
when doing a coal walk, right?

19:10.717 --> 19:12.319
No, no, not you, Pam.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.453
You have to keep score.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.188
I'd like to try.
Pointless.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.889
But I'm not kidding.
[speaking gibberish]
Okay?

19:16.923 --> 19:18.891
This is about guts.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.628
It takes guts to be
a regional manager.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.796
Jim, you're up.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.265
Nope.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.899
Ju--why not?
Come on.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.736
Oh, 'cause I don't want
my feet to get burned.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.706
You do not have
what it takes

19:33.740 --> 19:34.974
to be a regional manager.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.776
That's harsh.

19:36.809 --> 19:37.777
Who's next?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.346
Andy.
Where's Andy?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.681
Andy is never here today.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.819
Hello?
Who's there?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.688
My name is Andrew Bernard.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.358
I was with a group
called Dunder-Mifflin.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.663
Hello?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.298
Why don't you go,
Michael?

19:58.331 --> 19:59.799
Because I already did.

19:59.832 --> 20:00.733
Remember?

20:00.767 --> 20:04.237
I burned my foot
on the George Foreman grill.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.673
That is not the same
at all.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.940
If you're gonna ask
other people to do it,

20:07.974 --> 20:09.676
you should do it yourself.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.710
All right,
okay, all right.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.312
I'll do it.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.416
Okay.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.785
[clears throat]

20:18.818 --> 20:20.553
Okay.

20:29.028 --> 20:32.965
The mind has
to wrap around...

20:32.999 --> 20:35.435
the foot.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.321
Okay.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.659
(Oscar)
You're not doing anything.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.394
You want us
to count to three?

21:01.428 --> 21:03.496
Yes, count to three, please.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.998
(all)
Three, two, one.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.367
Count the other way.
Count--

21:07.400 --> 21:08.735
No, no,
count one, two, three.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.736
Not three, two, one.

21:09.769 --> 21:13.606
(all)
One, two, three.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.741
Go, Michael.
Do it.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.844
Wait, am I going on "go,"
or am I going on "three"?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.846
On the go
that's after three.

21:19.879 --> 21:20.547
Okay.

21:20.580 --> 21:25.885
(all)
One, two, three, go!

21:32.124 --> 21:33.493
No!

21:33.526 --> 21:34.661
It's okay.

21:34.694 --> 21:35.795
I will do this, Michael.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.029
(Ryan)
Don't, Dwight.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.732
I will walk and stand
on these coals

21:39.766 --> 21:41.734
until you award me
the position

21:41.768 --> 21:43.370
of regional manager!

21:45.805 --> 21:47.306
[light applause]
Wow.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.109
Dwight.
Dwight.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.778
Aaah!

21:51.811 --> 21:52.812
Ow.
Get off there.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.113
Get off, get off.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.782
Give me the job!

21:55.815 --> 21:56.583
Give me the job!

21:56.616 --> 21:57.817
I'm not going
to give it to you.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.686
Ow, oh!

21:59.719 --> 22:01.120
[all shouting at once]
Don't kneel on the coals!

22:01.153 --> 22:02.789
[alarmed shouts]

22:02.822 --> 22:04.824
(Kelly)
Michael, do something!

22:04.857 --> 22:07.394
God, that stinks!

22:08.761 --> 22:11.764
Being a boss is also
about image.

22:11.798 --> 22:14.734
I've never looked
like that.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.969
That was gross.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.905
I just--I don't see
the connection

22:18.938 --> 22:22.141
between a fire walk
and management.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.976
Worst 75 bucks
I ever spent.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.845
You know what?

22:25.878 --> 22:27.480
If I had to pick
my replacement

22:27.514 --> 22:28.981
based on today,

22:29.015 --> 22:31.684
it would be
Mr. Outside Hire.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.553
Or Mrs. Outside Hire.

22:33.586 --> 22:36.589
Yeah, mm-hmm, true.

22:36.623 --> 22:37.590
Look, I don't--

22:37.624 --> 22:41.127
I don't want to leave
this branch the I love

22:41.160 --> 22:42.762
to an outside hire.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.398
Therefore,
we're going to have

22:45.432 --> 22:48.435
a 100-point
winner take all

22:48.468 --> 22:51.604
sudden death
tribal counsel round

22:51.638 --> 22:55.408
to test the aspect
of my job

22:55.442 --> 22:56.643
that I think is
the most important.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.779
Something I call
the Bob Hope factor.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.014
Who's Bob Hope?
God!

23:02.048 --> 23:04.451
He's a,
he's a comedian.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.718
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.086
Who's Amanda Bynes?

23:07.119 --> 23:08.855
She's from What a Girl Wants.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.690
Oh, I love that movie.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.625
Yes, Kelly is right.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.627
The person
to replace me

23:14.661 --> 23:17.830
has to have
a great sense of humor.

23:17.864 --> 23:21.200
And they have to possess
the leadership qualities

23:21.233 --> 23:23.436
of a Bynes or a Hope.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.638
[fire crackling]

23:28.775 --> 23:31.110
So without further ado,

23:31.143 --> 23:35.047
Jim and Dwight...

23:35.081 --> 23:36.716
show us what you've got.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.787
Hey, I know what
you're looking for,

23:40.820 --> 23:43.456
but I gotta be honest.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.791
I really don't think
I should be considered

23:44.824 --> 23:46.493
as your replacement.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.795
You are being too modest.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.697
Michael, on Thursday,
I'm gonna drive down

23:50.730 --> 23:54.100
and interview with David for
the open position in New York.

23:56.569 --> 23:59.839
Okay, that is not funny.

23:59.872 --> 24:03.042
I am deducting 60 points

24:03.075 --> 24:04.844
from Voldemort

24:04.877 --> 24:06.613
for false pretenses.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.015
Okay, Dwight, your turn.
Wow us.

24:10.817 --> 24:11.851
The Aristocrats.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.621
A man and his wife
and children

24:14.654 --> 24:16.756
go into the offices
of a talent agency.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.925
[crackling]

24:21.761 --> 24:26.599
And the talent agent says,
"Describe your act."

24:26.633 --> 24:31.037
And the man says something
really, really raunchy.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.105
And the talent representative
says,

24:33.139 --> 24:35.107
"What do you call
yourselves?"

24:35.141 --> 24:38.210
And the man says,
"The Aristocrats."

24:41.581 --> 24:42.782
Ooh, ah!

24:42.815 --> 24:43.816
Whew!

24:43.850 --> 24:46.586
Ho ho!

24:46.619 --> 24:47.720
[sighs]

24:47.754 --> 24:50.623
(Dwight)
I mean, truly repulsive acts.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.992
That is a very,
very funny story.

24:53.025 --> 24:56.729
Hey, I want
to say something.

24:56.763 --> 24:58.731
I've been trying to be
more honest lately,

24:58.765 --> 25:00.667
and I just need to say
a few things.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.768
I did the coal walk.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.636
Just, I did it.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.972
Michael, you couldn't even
do that.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.174
Maybe I should be
your boss.

25:09.809 --> 25:13.846
Wow, I feel really good
right now.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.948
Why didn't any of you come
to my art show?

25:15.982 --> 25:17.884
[frog ribbiting]

25:17.917 --> 25:19.018
I invited all of you.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.588
That really sucked.

25:21.621 --> 25:22.889
It's like sometimes
some of you act

25:22.922 --> 25:24.223
like I don't even exist.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.264
Jim, I called off my wedding
because of you.

25:32.298 --> 25:35.001
And now we're
not even friends.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.670
And things are just, like,
weird between us,

25:37.704 --> 25:39.305
and that sucks.

25:39.338 --> 25:42.174
And I miss you.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.744
You were my best friend
before you went to Stamford.

25:44.777 --> 25:48.247
And I really miss you.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.783
I shouldn't have been
with Roy.

25:50.817 --> 25:54.353
There were a lot of reasons
to call off my wedding,

25:54.386 --> 25:56.155
but the truth is
I didn't care about

25:56.188 --> 25:58.024
any of those reasons
until I met you.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.159
And now you're
with someone else.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.861
And that's fine.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.830
It's whatever--

26:03.863 --> 26:04.831
that's not what I'm--

26:04.864 --> 26:05.798
I'm not--

26:05.832 --> 26:07.099
Okay, my feet
really hurt.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.601
The thing that
I'm just trying

26:08.635 --> 26:10.136
to say to you, Jim,

26:10.169 --> 26:13.806
and to everyone else
in the circle, I guess,

26:13.840 --> 26:15.942
is that I miss
having fun with you.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.946
Just you, not everyone
in the circle.

26:22.949 --> 26:28.020
Okay, I am gonna go walk
in the water now.

26:28.054 --> 26:31.891
Yeah, it's a good day.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.362
Pam, that was amazing.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.898
But I am still looking
for someone

26:38.931 --> 26:40.633
with a sales background.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.237
* Flintstones
meet the Flintstones *

26:45.271 --> 26:47.974
* They're a modern
Stone Age family *

26:48.007 --> 26:51.878
* From the town
of Bedrock *

26:51.911 --> 26:54.814
* They're a page
right out of history *

26:54.847 --> 26:56.248
(Michael)
* Ba da ba da ba

26:56.282 --> 26:58.417
* Let's ride with the family
down the street *

26:58.450 --> 26:59.986
* Ba da ba da

27:00.019 --> 27:01.988
* Through the courtesy
of Fred's two feet *

27:02.021 --> 27:02.889
* Ba da ba da

27:02.922 --> 27:05.291
* When you're with
the Flintstones *

27:05.324 --> 27:07.927
* Have a yabba dabba doo time

27:07.960 --> 27:09.696
* A dabba doo time

27:09.729 --> 27:10.997
* We'll have a gay
old time *

27:11.030 --> 27:15.067
[imitating Fred Flintstone]
Wilmaaaaaaaaaa!

27:15.101 --> 27:16.202
Nice.
