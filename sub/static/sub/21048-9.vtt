00:07.293 --> 00:11.011
You have something that
does not belong to you: Elena.

00:11.041 --> 00:13.931
I need to go to Litvinov.
If Litvinov has what we need,

00:14.236 --> 00:15.401
I'll make sure
he gives it to me.

00:16.965 --> 00:18.305
Your son?
Yes.

00:20.667 --> 00:24.991
It's time for all of this to be over.
3pm, at the fountain.

00:26.212 --> 00:28.462
Where's the key?
It doesn't work without a key

00:28.492 --> 00:31.335
I don't have the key.
She killed my husband.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.792
She got what she deserved.

00:34.095 --> 00:37.016
There's nothing to be
afraid of now. We're free.

00:37.046 --> 00:39.384
It's just you and me.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.682
Get off!
I love you!

00:43.772 --> 00:48.862
This family is a cancer.
It is poisoned at the root!

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.902 --> 01:07.572
Ok.

01:08.258 --> 01:10.061
Start in the kitchen.
I haven't looked there yet.

01:10.091 --> 01:13.460
We go room by room,
tear the place apart if we have to.

01:14.489 --> 01:16.930
The Russians think that the
key is somewhere in the villa.

01:17.106 --> 01:20.393
So, what we have to do is find it
before they come looking for it,

01:20.776 --> 01:24.255
hand it over to them and
I get the hell out of here.

01:24.285 --> 01:27.223
And what about the family?
Have you told them they're in danger?

01:28.835 --> 01:30.686
The family can go fuck themselves.

01:32.808 --> 01:36.542
<i>You and I are cut from the same ice</i>

01:36.572 --> 01:40.276
<i>Sincerity made us the perfect heist</i>

01:40.306 --> 01:44.062
<i>Burning all the gold to sapphire skies</i>

01:44.092 --> 01:47.796
<i>But the breeze is cold in paradise</i>

01:47.826 --> 01:51.514
<i>I can feel the whispers in the street</i>

01:51.544 --> 01:54.967
<i>Every night I shiver in my sleep</i>

01:54.997 --> 02:01.308
<i>No reality, cause it's all a dream</i>

02:02.266 --> 02:05.904
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

02:05.934 --> 02:09.437
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

02:09.467 --> 02:16.969
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

02:17.352 --> 02:21.118
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

02:21.148 --> 02:24.437
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

02:24.467 --> 02:32.096
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

02:32.126 --> 02:33.348
Patrice!

02:34.465 --> 02:36.907
You didn't say on the phone but
what did Adam do?

02:36.937 --> 02:38.135
It doesn't matter.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.646
Patrice!
It clearly does.

02:41.869 --> 02:43.736
I can take care of myself.

02:45.682 --> 02:48.539
Madame Clios,
how can I help you?

02:48.746 --> 02:51.427
I need you to deliver a message
to the rest of the staff.

02:51.730 --> 02:55.001
Of course. Whatever you need.
The message is...

02:55.520 --> 02:57.467
that you're all
relieved from your posts.

02:57.754 --> 03:00.578
You'll get a generous severance package
but you have to be out by the morning.

03:01.328 --> 03:03.929
But Madame Clios, who will
look after the house and...

03:03.959 --> 03:06.371
It's not up for discussion.
Thank you.

03:09.612 --> 03:11.080
It's for their own safety.
Georgine, please...

03:11.110 --> 03:14.256
I don't need anyone.
Then what am I doing here?

03:14.286 --> 03:17.304
You don't count.
Oh, now, that is charming!

03:18.485 --> 03:21.022
Is that a smile or...
No, it's not.

03:22.006 --> 03:24.496
You'll get a smile when
we find that fucking key.

04:00.937 --> 04:02.054
Good day.

04:44.913 --> 04:47.737
Ok, we can get a taxi from here.
Christos, listen...

04:47.913 --> 04:49.764
I still think I need
to go on my own.

04:51.088 --> 04:52.828
Ok.
No, listen, it's...

04:53.813 --> 04:56.749
It's safer this way.
It's me they're after.

04:56.779 --> 04:58.824
That's just crazy.
Where are you going to go?

05:00.755 --> 05:02.239
Wait! Fatima, listen...

05:02.398 --> 05:04.584
No, just let it go.
I'll be fine.

05:04.614 --> 05:05.228
No!

05:05.452 --> 05:07.622
I know you'll be fine.
I won't be.

05:07.957 --> 05:11.883
You know, I don't even think
about using when I'm with you.

05:14.683 --> 05:18.545
So what? I'm your sponsor?
Right. And it's against...

05:20.124 --> 05:22.917
It's against so many laws of rehab
if you just abandon me right now.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.034
It's really bad!

05:29.941 --> 05:30.915
Don't abandon me.

05:32.080 --> 05:32.814
Please.

05:34.441 --> 05:36.101
I'll think about it.
Ok.

05:39.178 --> 05:39.976
Have to...

05:59.184 --> 06:02.903
<i>Thank you, sir. Come again.</i>

06:17.387 --> 06:17.834
Clios!

07:00.537 --> 07:03.043
Sounds like someone's
trying to get your attention.

07:03.793 --> 07:04.910
Friend or foe?

07:05.580 --> 07:07.670
Does it really make a difference,
these days?

07:18.543 --> 07:21.894
Can I help you?
Is this where Christos lives?

07:39.119 --> 07:41.879
You say someone took him.
Yes.

07:44.193 --> 07:45.629
You're the one, aren't you?

07:48.386 --> 07:50.205
You;re the one
my son talked about...

07:50.828 --> 07:51.673
helping him.

07:54.354 --> 07:56.445
Is it your fault, all of this?

07:56.971 --> 07:59.205
I think I know who's responsible.

08:00.274 --> 08:00.881
What?

08:04.190 --> 08:06.041
What is going on?

08:08.147 --> 08:10.621
Here you are.
English Breakfast.

08:11.786 --> 08:13.812
It's a cure for everything.
I swear by it.

08:13.842 --> 08:15.145
I don't need anything.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.886
<i>That's not what I thought, I...</i>

08:16.916 --> 08:18.305
Go on, it'll make you feel better.

08:19.023 --> 08:22.182
<i>How could you be so stupid?</i>

08:22.212 --> 08:23.624
I didn't create this!

08:23.654 --> 08:25.874
If you want someone to blame,
look at your ex-husband.

08:25.904 --> 08:27.342
You know what kind of man you married.

08:27.372 --> 08:29.927
Oh! And you were clueless,
just another dumb blonde?

08:30.693 --> 08:33.756
The minute you knew about this
fucking key, you should have told me!

08:33.787 --> 08:35.849
So what? So you could
get your face blown off?

08:35.879 --> 08:38.370
I was trying to protect you.
All of you.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.907
It's my job to protect my family.

08:41.832 --> 08:43.524
Did they threaten my kids?

08:43.907 --> 08:44.450
Yes.

08:45.694 --> 08:46.412
Yes, they did.

08:52.654 --> 08:56.532
It's customary to knock, Ads.
What's the occasion?

08:58.877 --> 09:00.760
I'm not really in the mood for company.

09:03.778 --> 09:04.544
Tough!

09:09.395 --> 09:11.837
Hi, this is Christos Clios,
please leave me your message.

09:12.148 --> 09:15.467
Ahh, Christos, please call me back
as soon as you get this.

09:17.877 --> 09:20.127
He's not going to answer.
I know.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.329
I have to do something.

09:25.171 --> 09:26.879
Adam, I saw you last night.

09:34.443 --> 09:35.623
It wasn't how it looked.

09:38.377 --> 09:39.637
Have you asked her?

09:39.667 --> 09:42.765
You're my brother, dickhead!
If there's a side to be on, it's yours.

09:47.324 --> 09:48.345
I love her.

09:51.856 --> 09:52.989
You love her?

09:55.622 --> 09:57.744
Adam, she's our stepmom.
Thank you.

09:57.774 --> 10:00.568
Sorry! It's just fucked up.

10:07.590 --> 10:10.127
Adriana...
Yes, mother?

10:10.510 --> 10:12.824
Are you ok?
Yes, mother.

10:13.525 --> 10:14.833
Well, where are you?

10:15.025 --> 10:17.403
Adam's.
And Adam will hear. Is he ok?

10:18.153 --> 10:21.472
What's the concern?
Listen, don't come back to the villa!

10:21.502 --> 10:24.759
You or Adam.
They think we have a key...

10:24.925 --> 10:27.175
Something your father left.
Who?

10:27.398 --> 10:30.957
Some Russians. The Big Bad Wolf.
It doesn't matter. Just promise me...

10:31.180 --> 10:32.664
you will stay away.

10:33.861 --> 10:34.786
Ok.

10:45.496 --> 10:46.134
Hello?

11:32.332 --> 11:33.864
Does it say who it's from?

11:35.013 --> 11:36.385
It doesn't have to.

11:37.151 --> 11:38.412
It's from Litvinov.

11:43.816 --> 11:45.539
This is a declaration of war.

11:56.663 --> 11:57.429
Thirty two...

11:58.483 --> 12:00.589
the number of teeth an adult has.

12:01.499 --> 12:03.924
That's 31 more chances
to get to the truth.

12:05.041 --> 12:05.791
Please.

12:10.368 --> 12:11.772
You know how to stop this.

12:13.911 --> 12:15.602
Tell me where the key is.

12:17.980 --> 12:19.208
I don't have it.

12:21.570 --> 12:22.735
I don't have it!

12:39.983 --> 12:40.596
Tell me.

12:42.869 --> 12:43.405
Tell me!

12:46.628 --> 12:52.692
I don't have your fucking key!
Ok? I don't fucking have it!

12:59.469 --> 13:00.273
Your choice.

13:04.703 --> 13:06.822
Please!
Your choice.

13:07.749 --> 13:08.426
Please.

13:11.183 --> 13:14.158
No, no, no! Listen to me!
Listen to me! No...

13:15.575 --> 13:17.056
Ok, I thought I have it!

13:17.384 --> 13:17.818
Please.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.022
Please, please!
No, I don't have it!

14:41.921 --> 14:43.230
Robert.
Yeah?

14:43.628 --> 14:46.166
Do me a favor.
Take her to your place.

14:46.485 --> 14:47.873
It should be safer there.

14:48.315 --> 14:51.267
Georgie, what are you up to?
Scratch it and you're a dead man.

15:02.321 --> 15:04.619
Fatima, let's
get you somewhere safer.

15:04.649 --> 15:08.034
So, what do you propose we do, exactly?
We have no power, no phones, nothing.

15:08.064 --> 15:09.278
We tell them the truth.

15:09.702 --> 15:12.894
Tell them that we don't have the key
and neither does Christos.

15:13.053 --> 15:16.979
And then, we beg for your son's life.
Appeal to his humanity.

15:17.713 --> 15:18.766
He's not a man.

15:19.037 --> 15:20.154
He's a fucking animal.

15:21.518 --> 15:23.895
Are you saving Christos?
No, think about it.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.512
He doesn't want
a dead body on his hands.

15:26.847 --> 15:28.858
He certainly
doesn't want a dead Clios.

15:29.528 --> 15:30.629
And he knows you.

15:31.193 --> 15:36.603
Go to him in person, show him
some respect and get your son back.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.414
How did you know he was here?
Alison Martinson.

16:52.621 --> 16:55.031
A Riviera wedding this important
doesn't happen without

16:55.061 --> 16:56.594
an invitation coming my way.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.509
Well, you weren't
invited to our wedding.

16:58.812 --> 17:00.009
Exactly, darling.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.659
Are you coming with me?

17:02.689 --> 17:05.451
No, no. It has to be
one parent to another.

17:06.217 --> 17:07.845
All you have to do is say...
Thank you.

17:09.313 --> 17:10.397
I know my lines.

17:21.933 --> 17:26.959
<i>Why, why, why, Delilah?</i>

17:29.289 --> 17:36.039
<i>So, before
they come to break down the door</i>

17:36.069 --> 17:41.271
<i>forgive me, Delilah.
I just couldn't take any more.</i>

17:43.553 --> 17:53.383
<i>forgive me, Delilah.
I just couldn't take any more.</i>

18:49.327 --> 18:52.263
Sasha! Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

18:52.293 --> 18:54.529
I was at your
piano lesson, remember?

18:54.960 --> 18:56.619
The cake looks good, doesn't it?

19:14.528 --> 19:17.735
Forgive me for the intrusion.
Do you have what I want?

19:18.661 --> 19:20.065
No, no, but...

19:20.352 --> 19:21.326
Get out, please.

19:22.322 --> 19:24.205
Please, please, Grigory!

19:24.396 --> 19:25.577
I am here as a mother.

19:26.104 --> 19:29.886
Let my son go. We can't
give you what we don't have.

19:29.916 --> 19:31.928
If only I believed you,
Madame Clios.

19:32.620 --> 19:36.306
Now, please, you are
ruining my sister's big day.

19:37.024 --> 19:39.960
Christos hasn't done anything to you.
He's innocent!

19:39.990 --> 19:41.524
A Clios innocent?

19:42.350 --> 19:44.727
If neither one of you
starts telling the truth,

19:45.557 --> 19:46.945
your beloved son...

19:47.169 --> 19:49.147
will bear the consequences.

19:49.674 --> 19:53.233
Your Dad asked me to
take care of you for a little while

19:53.263 --> 19:56.169
and I was thinking, the adults are
going to be talking and talking.

19:56.199 --> 19:59.406
They get boring and boring and we
should just get out of here, right?

20:00.508 --> 20:01.752
What about my Mommy?

20:02.087 --> 20:05.502
Oh, well, she's going to
come and tuck you in later, ok?

20:07.174 --> 20:11.147
So, I hate for a happy occasion
like this to be ruined.

20:11.177 --> 20:16.493
Days of torture, violence, murder!

20:17.279 --> 20:18.986
Shut your mouth
or I'll shut it for you!

20:47.751 --> 20:50.432
You just set his death warrant.

20:56.568 --> 20:58.658
Irina! Irina!

21:00.445 --> 21:01.834
Irina, get in!

21:40.815 --> 21:41.788
Hi, are you...

21:47.086 --> 21:48.203
Hello, little man.

21:48.387 --> 21:52.345
My name is Robert. What's yours?
Sasha

21:52.648 --> 21:53.414
Sasha...

21:54.499 --> 21:55.376
Litvinov.

21:57.608 --> 22:00.943
Ok, now that introductions are done,
I'll leave you to it.

22:51.956 --> 22:53.057
You used me.

22:53.727 --> 22:55.132
It was necessary.

22:55.162 --> 22:57.765
I needed a distraction.
It wouldn't have worked otherwise.

22:57.795 --> 22:59.256
Abducting a child?

22:59.575 --> 23:03.453
It's a new low, even for you!
He is not a child.

23:03.483 --> 23:06.421
He's a bargaining chip and
one that we can't do without.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.511
But don't you understand?
You've only made things worse.

23:09.764 --> 23:12.094
He'll kill Christos.
No, he won't.

23:12.588 --> 23:15.237
All he wants is
his son back, safe and well,

23:15.445 --> 23:18.668
at whatever cost. If that means
releasing Christos, then so be it.

23:19.284 --> 23:21.024
And something that
you'd be wise to remember

23:21.054 --> 23:23.896
is that we didn't cross
this line, Litvinov did.

23:24.359 --> 23:25.907
We're only responding in kind

23:25.937 --> 23:29.585
in a language that only a
psychopath like him can understand.

23:30.180 --> 23:31.265
An eye for an eye...

23:31.919 --> 23:33.738
or a tooth for a tooth.Yes?
I asked you politely and in good faith

23:50.560 --> 23:51.230
Yes?

23:51.260 --> 23:54.039
I asked you politely
and in good faith.

23:54.278 --> 23:57.214
You turned me down and
your sister called me a bitch,

23:57.390 --> 23:59.321
so, I'm not
asking politely any more.

24:00.059 --> 24:02.660
Bring Christos to the
football stadium tonight,

24:02.690 --> 24:05.580
15 minutes before kickoff,
you will get your son back.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.495
Hurt Christos again,

24:07.525 --> 24:10.511
try anything stupid,
fuck me around in any way,

24:10.926 --> 24:13.718
and you'll see how much
of a bitch I can really be.

24:25.302 --> 24:26.993
She's the first person...

24:28.477 --> 24:30.073
who ever made me feel like...

24:31.573 --> 24:33.248
I'm enough, as myself.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.754
Stupid, aren't I?

24:37.557 --> 24:38.690
No, I get it.

24:42.402 --> 24:43.774
All that's done with, now.

24:46.312 --> 24:47.540
And do you know who I blame?

24:50.493 --> 24:51.578
Dad.

24:53.583 --> 24:55.307
He did, kind of get enough ass.

24:55.337 --> 24:57.333
Because he always
landed on his feet.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.472
Whatever he wanted,

25:00.908 --> 25:02.791
the next minute, it was his...

25:03.349 --> 25:04.318
including her.

25:08.259 --> 25:12.983
He'd get bored and toss his
old toy aside and get a new one.

25:13.867 --> 25:15.750
The only thing
he was stuck with was us.

25:16.006 --> 25:17.426
Don't say that.

25:19.006 --> 25:20.889
Ok, he was hardly
a model father but

25:23.027 --> 25:24.064
he loved us.

25:24.975 --> 25:26.267
I really do believe he did.

25:27.161 --> 25:28.581
Of course, you do.

25:30.305 --> 25:33.432
I was his great disappointment.

25:35.187 --> 25:38.155
You can't trade your
kids in for a better model.

25:39.511 --> 25:40.947
You're just drunk.

25:43.070 --> 25:45.910
Hey, guys, here we go:
Chef's Special!

25:46.399 --> 25:47.518
Thank you

25:47.548 --> 25:50.867
Capacity is 30,000, so\
we'll have plenty of witnesses

25:51.170 --> 25:53.643
and weapons aren't allowed
anywhere near the stadium, so..

25:53.673 --> 25:55.093
at least, it's a level playing field.

25:55.123 --> 25:57.232
Here we go.
I don't like cheese.

25:57.262 --> 25:59.210
You live in France.
How could you not like cheese?

26:01.891 --> 26:02.992
It's ok.
Nope!

26:03.269 --> 26:06.541
You are not getting up from this table
until every mouthful is gone!

26:06.571 --> 26:07.690
Do you understand?

26:09.030 --> 26:09.700
Huh?

26:11.775 --> 26:12.557
Good.

26:14.664 --> 26:15.653
Bon appetit.

26:18.941 --> 26:20.153
And I'm the bitch?

26:33.273 --> 26:34.678
Adam, what the fuck!

26:38.347 --> 26:39.959
I always wondered
why he did it.

26:41.140 --> 26:42.724
One pure moment of pain

26:44.505 --> 26:44.506
Stop.

26:50.585 --> 26:52.421
Ah, the real tragic thing...

26:53.099 --> 26:56.562
All I ever wanted was for Dad
to treat me like I was a real son.

26:57.701 --> 27:00.207
Instead, he treated me
like a little errand boy.

27:02.967 --> 27:04.866
The last thing
he said to me was...

27:08.658 --> 27:10.286
"Look after this for me".

27:13.573 --> 27:15.137
And yet, you still have it?

27:16.015 --> 27:18.201
It's the last thing
he ever gave me.

27:26.683 --> 27:28.215
I just can't let it go.

27:33.608 --> 27:36.050
She must seem like the
Wicked Witch Of The West, right?

27:36.790 --> 27:38.019
I hate her.

27:39.806 --> 27:42.694
I've known Georgie for more years
than you've been alive.

27:43.349 --> 27:46.093
So, I know what
she's really like and honestly

27:46.586 --> 27:48.708
She is so not the Wicked Witch.

27:49.889 --> 27:52.905
I think she's
more like the Tin Man.

27:53.703 --> 27:54.405
Really?

27:54.435 --> 27:57.198
Yeah, but she doesn't
want it to be that way.

27:57.539 --> 27:59.885
She wants her heart back
just as badly as he did.

28:00.044 --> 28:01.241
What happened to it?

28:03.156 --> 28:08.374
Well, a horrible man
took it and broke it.

28:09.193 --> 28:13.469
And so, now, she does things and says
things that she doesn't really mean.

28:14.347 --> 28:16.406
Like with you, tonight.
You see?

28:16.884 --> 28:18.161
Can't she get it back?

28:20.184 --> 28:21.700
I would if I could.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.172
Go on.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.112
Georgie.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.819
Oh, thanks.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.141
Remember when you
first met me, at the Institute?

28:57.572 --> 28:58.210
Yeah.

29:00.383 --> 29:03.383
I remember looking at you
and thinking: "Wow...

29:03.702 --> 29:06.462
now that girl looks about
as shit scared as I do".

29:06.925 --> 29:08.138
I was shit scared.

29:09.351 --> 29:12.521
I remember walking
into that big old building

29:12.551 --> 29:16.846
with history staring me in the face
and feeling like a total fraud.

29:17.021 --> 29:20.021
No, I think anyone worth their salt
felt like a fraud in that place.

29:21.282 --> 29:22.766
I didn't belong there.

29:24.825 --> 29:25.862
I don't belong here.

29:27.346 --> 29:30.059
I used to think that these people
were so much better than me

29:31.099 --> 29:32.040
because they had...

29:33.955 --> 29:34.498
what...

29:35.998 --> 29:38.152
but if I could just get
a little of what they had.

29:39.030 --> 29:41.104
it would make me classy.
Right?

29:42.405 --> 29:43.458
It's bullshit.

29:45.213 --> 29:46.857
Look what it's made me.

29:50.596 --> 29:52.702
Why are you still here, Robert?

29:54.522 --> 29:55.575
Let me tell you something.

29:55.605 --> 29:58.670
If I were you, I wouldn't want
to be anywhere near me right now.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.835
I'm still here because
of that girl I first met.

30:03.921 --> 30:08.484
The one I think you really are.
I'm not that girl anymore.

30:13.944 --> 30:15.444
I am so angry...

30:18.268 --> 30:18.986
and I'm...

30:19.719 --> 30:21.953
scared that it's
never going to go away.

30:26.468 --> 30:28.064
I don't want to be like this.

30:29.883 --> 30:31.399
Then, don't be.

30:58.508 --> 30:59.402
Sasha.

31:00.679 --> 31:01.556
Sasha.

31:03.088 --> 31:04.062
I'm sorry.

31:05.163 --> 31:06.471
I'm really sorry.

31:09.275 --> 31:10.487
Let's get you home, ok?

31:11.525 --> 31:12.163
Come on.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.538
I want you to
remember this moment.

31:40.262 --> 31:41.059
Look at me.

31:43.246 --> 31:44.012
Look at me.

32:14.964 --> 32:16.017
Alright,

32:16.352 --> 32:17.756
let's get you...

32:20.711 --> 32:21.749
Got it?
Yeah.

32:23.663 --> 32:24.174
Good.

32:26.360 --> 32:30.094
You're gonna bring Christos back, right?
We will, don't worry.

33:25.645 --> 33:28.294
Do not let him go until
we have eyes on Christos.

33:28.868 --> 33:30.033
Ok?
Ok.

33:50.190 --> 33:51.084
Where's my boy?

33:53.222 --> 33:54.355
Where's my boy?

34:01.422 --> 34:02.076
How is Sasha?

34:02.810 --> 34:04.485
A lot better than Christos.

34:39.192 --> 34:40.054
I'm here,

34:40.755 --> 34:41.330
Hold on.

34:44.074 --> 34:44.937
Wait a minute.

34:49.063 --> 34:50.500
The Dumas I gave you was a fake.

34:53.053 --> 34:55.670
and the man who now has it...

34:57.408 --> 35:00.120
works for certain elements
within the Russian government.

35:01.413 --> 35:03.440
They'll think
you fucked with them.

35:04.541 --> 35:05.642
Which is, for you...

35:06.631 --> 35:07.668
How do you say it in English?

35:08.931 --> 35:09.697
game over.

35:13.559 --> 35:14.468
Bring me the key...

35:16.208 --> 35:17.947
and I make this all go away.

35:20.342 --> 35:21.092
Bring me the key.

37:03.515 --> 37:05.956
I think I've had one too many
to help my mother.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.205
What happened?
Did you find your key?

37:15.235 --> 37:18.237
Christos has been hurt. Georgina is
driving us to the hospital right now.

37:18.267 --> 37:19.896
Well wha...
Is he ok?

37:20.710 --> 37:23.056
He will be.
Just get there, darling.

37:23.281 --> 37:26.313
Both of you.
Of course, (?)

37:28.005 --> 37:29.074
What key?

37:29.585 --> 37:32.010
Earlier, she was rambling
about needing a key.

37:32.785 --> 37:36.271
Something of Dad's?
I don't know. Maybe.

37:42.112 --> 37:42.814
What?

37:49.122 --> 37:50.622
Give it to Georgina.

37:53.558 --> 37:54.771
Tell her I'm sorry.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.275
Hey...

38:17.185 --> 38:19.116
Where's your brother?
He's not coming.

38:21.622 --> 38:24.973
Can I go see Christos?
Yes, of course, darling. Go.

38:34.592 --> 38:36.954
He looks a lot worse
than he actually is.

38:51.295 --> 38:53.577
Georgina.
Yeah?

38:56.720 --> 38:57.582
Thank you.

42:01.066 --> 42:01.752
Fatima.

42:14.755 --> 42:16.797
He did like you, you know.

42:17.420 --> 42:18.090
Who?

42:18.541 --> 42:19.642
Constantine.

42:21.892 --> 42:22.961
It was me.

42:23.599 --> 42:25.945
I'm the reason that
we lost touch for so long.

42:25.975 --> 42:28.466
Georgine. you don't have to...
Wait, wait, wait, just let me finish.

42:29.406 --> 42:31.209
I thought I didn't need you.

42:32.076 --> 42:34.725
I mean, I thought that
I didn't need my past.

42:35.236 --> 42:38.331
I'm sorry, I thought...
It's ok.

42:39.927 --> 42:40.837
We're ok.

42:42.699 --> 42:45.603
Georgie, I almost forgot.
I've got something for you...

42:46.082 --> 42:46.880
from Adam.

42:47.247 --> 42:48.523
From Adam?
Yes.

42:50.789 --> 42:52.369
He thinks it might be the key.

42:57.092 --> 43:00.235
I cannot believe it!
After all this time, Adam?

43:00.459 --> 43:02.501
Maybe you can finally
put a stop to all this.

43:04.060 --> 43:05.720
Do you remember
where you parked my car?

43:05.750 --> 43:07.890
Do you know,
I can't rightly remember.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.661
That's old age for you.

43:09.691 --> 43:11.113
I'll have you know,
I'm in my prime.

43:12.151 --> 43:13.236
Oh, it's right this way.

43:21.646 --> 43:23.210
Georgie!
What?

43:50.090 --> 43:53.840
Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees

43:53.870 --> 43:57.333
Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive thing

43:57.363 --> 44:04.911
I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy
