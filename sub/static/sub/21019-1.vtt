00:36.139 --> 00:40.141
It began with the retrieval
of the Great Ball.

00:42.578 --> 00:46.445
Stolen by the Beast, the monster
poured into its possession...

00:46.447 --> 00:52.383
his slobber and his will to dominate
all who trespassed his land.

00:54.854 --> 00:56.220
But there were some
who resisted.

00:56.222 --> 01:02.792
An alliance of neighborhood kids banded together
and fought for possession of the Great Ball.

01:15.804 --> 01:18.171
When all seemed lost,
Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez...

01:18.173 --> 01:23.208
Aided by magic shoes guaranteed to make
a kid run faster and jump higher...

01:23.210 --> 01:26.344
Battled for the future
of the sandlot.

01:29.648 --> 01:33.549
Hercules, the Beast,
enemy of all free kids,

01:33.551 --> 01:36.852
was finally defeated.

01:37.855 --> 01:40.188
Time passed,
and for 3,000 days...

01:40.190 --> 01:44.290
the Great Ball, its retrieval and the
danger of what was once contained...

01:44.292 --> 01:48.827
behind the left field fence,
was almost forgotten.

01:51.698 --> 01:55.366
Rumors grew up
about a shadow of the Beast.

01:56.702 --> 02:02.205
Finally, when nine new kids came
to the sandlot in the year 1972,

02:02.207 --> 02:07.175
something old and new
was waiting.

02:07.177 --> 02:09.544
I was the only one
that knew anything about it.

02:09.545 --> 02:12.212
My name is Johnnie Smalls,
and that was the summer that...

02:12.214 --> 02:17.216
a kid named David Vincent Durango taught
me the greatest lesson in life...

02:17.218 --> 02:18.717
and became the very first hero
I ever knew.

02:18.719 --> 02:23.388
But even though what happened that
summer happened on the sandlot,

02:23.390 --> 02:26.490
it had nothing
to do with baseball.

02:26.492 --> 02:28.825
After one long year,

02:28.827 --> 02:31.294
Jonathan Buckminster Smalls,

02:31.296 --> 02:34.463
All City third grade science
project winner.

02:34.465 --> 02:41.202
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Saturn Apollo rocket.

02:49.778 --> 02:53.512
Godspeed, Astro Jake.

03:02.888 --> 03:08.591
Flight deck...
This is mission control.

03:08.593 --> 03:11.926
We are "go" for launch.

03:11.928 --> 03:16.797
The summer between sixth grade
and seventh grade...

03:16.799 --> 03:18.465
is the best of times
and the worst of times.

03:18.467 --> 03:21.567
Cartoons, army men and making crank
calls aren't important anymore...

03:21.569 --> 03:25.403
because you're focused on zits, B.O.
and how your breath smells.

03:36.281 --> 03:40.749
The one great moment in your life
containing all your potential futures.

03:40.751 --> 03:47.654
Start down the path of greatness
or hate yourself forever.

03:47.656 --> 03:50.689
You're supposed to say,
"I'm sorry."

03:51.926 --> 03:54.525
Earth to boy.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.698
You're really fast. Thanks.

04:04.936 --> 04:06.969
You're supposed to say,
"You're welcome."

04:23.984 --> 04:27.385
The moment he first had
a chance to talk to her...

04:27.387 --> 04:29.987
was not the one great moment
of his life.

04:29.989 --> 04:34.958
That moment for David
would come 99 days later.

04:34.960 --> 04:39.695
Hey, David, let's go play some baseball.
Yeah, David. Come on.

04:39.697 --> 04:42.797
Let's go to the sandlot.

04:44.634 --> 04:47.801
David.

04:48.337 --> 04:52.471
Her name's Hayley Goodfairer.
Solid.

04:53.841 --> 04:56.574
Sammy says
she moved here a month ago.

04:56.576 --> 04:57.976
Her dad's some kind of
government egghead.

04:57.978 --> 05:02.646
He's worked in the South most of her life,
so she's from, like, down there somewhere.

05:02.648 --> 05:05.748
She's 12 going on 13.
Got a late in the year birthday.

05:05.750 --> 05:08.718
How the hell
do you know that, Fingers?

05:09.020 --> 05:12.821
It's his purpose in life to know
all the facts about the ladies.

05:12.823 --> 05:15.090
I heard she's liberated.

05:15.092 --> 05:18.826
Tarq, she's a girl. Who cares?
Like, I'm just sayin'.

05:18.828 --> 05:24.631
You're all wasting time. We still have a
huge problem, in case all you bozos forgot.

05:24.633 --> 05:25.764
If we don't figure
something out,

05:25.766 --> 05:29.735
our first whole summer on the sandlot
is gonna be over before it starts.

05:29.737 --> 05:33.371
Crap. He's right. Let's roll.

05:46.450 --> 05:50.049
The sandlot was like
David's baseball kingdom.

05:50.051 --> 05:52.018
Nine, eight... But that summer,
a kid named Singleton...

05:52.020 --> 05:56.521
who was the captain of a Little League team,
set his sights on taking it from him.

05:56.523 --> 06:00.658
It was a bitter rivalry, and one day
I got caught in the middle of it...

06:00.660 --> 06:05.028
and almost didn't live to see tomorrow.
A hundred days of baseball.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.630
This is so much fun.

06:08.766 --> 06:13.935
I don't know.
Hey, guys, who's that kid?

06:13.937 --> 06:18.071
Hey. What's that thing?

06:18.073 --> 06:20.807
Oh, my God. He's one of them.

06:20.809 --> 06:23.476
He's gonna blow up
the sandlot. Get him!

06:23.478 --> 06:27.946
Come on!
Five, four, three, two, one.

06:27.948 --> 06:31.516
We have ignition.

06:32.818 --> 06:34.551
Holy crap!

06:34.553 --> 06:39.422
Look out! Look out!

06:46.497 --> 06:49.830
There he goes. Get him!
There he goes.

06:49.832 --> 06:52.565
Get back here.
There's nowhere to run.

06:52.567 --> 06:57.436
We're gonna get you.
You can run, but you can't hide.

06:57.438 --> 06:58.871
Get him.
He's going over the fence.

06:58.873 --> 07:03.808
Get back here, you little jerk.

07:09.148 --> 07:13.149
Come on.
He's somewhere around here.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.121
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

07:20.123 --> 07:24.425
What are yousdoing here?
I live here.

07:24.427 --> 07:27.427
You live here?
Next to the sandlot?

07:27.429 --> 07:31.897
Look, I don't know anything about
a sandlot, whatever that is.

07:31.899 --> 07:35.100
But this is private property,
and you're trespassing.

07:36.936 --> 07:41.704
What's she talking about?
That punk blew up our dugout.

07:41.706 --> 07:44.940
It's none of your business anyway.
Hand him over and we'll leave.

07:44.942 --> 07:49.210
How about you leave,
or I'll call the police?

08:00.954 --> 08:06.557
The whole place is gonna burn down.
Can we use your hose?

08:06.559 --> 08:07.825
Please. Please. Come on.

08:07.827 --> 08:12.662
Aw, come on.

08:12.664 --> 08:15.096
The dugout's on fire.
Okay. Go ahead.

08:15.098 --> 08:18.133
Go, go, go, go. Hurry up, guys!

08:18.135 --> 08:22.069
Guys, get the gate! Get the gate!
Follow me, guys.

08:22.071 --> 08:24.704
Follow me. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

08:24.706 --> 08:29.675
Hurry up! Faster, guys. Faster.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.044
Whoa! Here. Let me do it.

08:32.046 --> 08:35.145
Let me help. Let me help.
Let go.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.248
Get off him. Get off him.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.549
Guys, let him do it.

08:44.655 --> 08:47.689
Thanks. For what?

08:47.691 --> 08:48.756
They're just silly boys.

08:48.758 --> 08:53.227
Maybe to you. To me, they're
like dogs with rabies.

08:53.229 --> 08:56.663
Sixth graders. Very dangerous.

08:56.665 --> 09:00.199
Well, then, you better
go while they're busy.

09:00.201 --> 09:02.034
Okay. Hurry up!

09:02.036 --> 09:06.738
But be here tomorrow... early.
Why?

09:06.740 --> 09:11.941
I saved your life, now you
have to do exactly what I say.

09:11.943 --> 09:12.575
Okay.

09:12.577 --> 09:18.514
The last thing a kid needs on his first
day of summer vacation is an enemy.

09:18.516 --> 09:23.284
And now I had five of them.
But I also had a new friend.

09:23.286 --> 09:27.888
And it was because of me and Hayley
that David would finally come...

09:27.890 --> 09:32.091
to the one great moment
in his life.

09:37.831 --> 09:41.765
Do I have to rake
the whole field?

09:42.835 --> 09:44.668
Oh. Hi, Daddy.

09:44.670 --> 09:46.802
Hey, uh, sweetheart. Roger.

09:46.804 --> 09:50.306
You know referring to Hayley
with frilly nicknames is sexist.

09:50.308 --> 09:52.973
It negatively impacts
her developing self-esteem.

09:52.975 --> 09:55.942
Now, she is every bit
the equal of a male child.

09:55.944 --> 09:59.178
Right. Sorry, uh...
Sorry there, uh, buddy.

09:59.180 --> 10:02.247
That is much better.

10:02.249 --> 10:04.949
I gotta go. And you, you be good.
Bye, Mom.

10:04.951 --> 10:08.185
Bye. See you later, sweetheart.

10:08.187 --> 10:10.554
Uh, partner.

10:14.959 --> 10:17.927
Uh, Dad, this is my friend, uh...

10:17.929 --> 10:19.161
Johnnie. Yeah.

10:19.163 --> 10:24.331
Oh, hey-hey, Johnnie.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.299
Nice to meet you, John.

10:25.301 --> 10:28.769
Yeah. It's nice to
meet you there, Johnnie.

10:28.771 --> 10:32.838
Anyway, Johnnie's into rockets too.
Hayley... No, no.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.141
Dad, please.
There's the NASA logo.

10:36.143 --> 10:39.677
Oh. I've got my...
Yeah, whoops, there.

10:39.679 --> 10:42.980
Uh... Well, Johnnie,
uh, model rocketry,

10:42.982 --> 10:49.017
that's a great little hobby. With all
due respect, sir, rockets are my life.

10:49.019 --> 10:49.885
Really?

10:49.887 --> 10:54.889
Well, mine too. May I ask, sir,
what you're currently working on?

10:54.891 --> 10:58.191
Well, you could. But if I
told you, I'd have to...

10:58.193 --> 10:59.793
Daddy. What?

10:59.795 --> 11:03.128
That's okay.
I know he's just kidding.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.797
Not really.

11:04.799 --> 11:08.833
Yes, sir. I understand. Yeah.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.736
We'll see you around there, buddy.
Okay. Count on it, sir.

11:11.738 --> 11:15.639
Okay. See you later,
sweetheart, uh, tiger. Yeah.

11:15.641 --> 11:19.275
Right. Bye, Dad.

11:21.312 --> 11:24.913
Forget it. You need security
clearance to get in there.

11:24.915 --> 11:27.715
In your own garage?
My dad's workshop.

11:27.717 --> 11:33.152
Grab that sprinkler. You've
got a lot of work to do.

12:17.022 --> 12:22.724
They turned the dugout
into a dollhouse.

12:22.726 --> 12:25.693
Is that legal? Is what legal?

12:25.695 --> 12:27.928
Girls... on a baseball diamond.

12:27.930 --> 12:31.698
What are you doing here?
You said that yesterday.

12:31.700 --> 12:35.200
Is that all you know how to say?
Besides, none of your beeswax.

12:35.202 --> 12:41.072
You're not allowed to be here. We have
as much right to play here as you do.

12:41.074 --> 12:42.840
Play what? Baseball.

12:42.842 --> 12:47.077
Are you taking loony pills?
What's that supposed to mean?

12:47.079 --> 12:52.148
That's a softball... squishy...
For girls.

12:55.752 --> 12:59.353
This is a baseball.
What men play with.

12:59.355 --> 13:03.390
Then what are you
doing with one?

13:08.328 --> 13:11.797
Well? "Well" what?

13:11.799 --> 13:14.799
Leave already. No.

13:16.869 --> 13:19.302
Look, doll,
this is a baseball diamond.

13:19.304 --> 13:21.037
We come here to play
a serious game of baseball.

13:21.039 --> 13:25.841
You and your friends should go home and
play with your Barbies before you get hurt.

13:25.843 --> 13:28.342
Are you threatening me?
No, sugar.

13:28.344 --> 13:33.447
He just means if there's a bad hop, you
could get hurt being, like, girls and all.

13:33.449 --> 13:38.050
And you're a male chauvinist
pig, being, like, a boy and all.

13:38.052 --> 13:43.988
That's what my mom calls my dad.
I told you, she's liberated.

13:43.990 --> 13:48.258
Yes, I am, and I can do
anything you can do better.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.395
This is a baseball,
same as that.

13:53.998 --> 13:57.765
For the love of Pete,
are you deaf?

13:57.767 --> 14:00.234
Sorry, Fingers.

14:03.505 --> 14:08.040
This is not a baseball.
It's a softball.

14:08.042 --> 14:10.909
My three-year-old sister
can hit this grapefruit.

14:10.911 --> 14:13.344
With a souvenir Dodger bat.

14:13.346 --> 14:17.314
And if you pitch it
60 miles an hour.

14:17.316 --> 14:23.319
I bet you couldn't hit it.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.988
Say what?

14:26.990 --> 14:28.356
I don't bet trash. I burn it.

14:28.358 --> 14:33.794
What did you say? I'll bet I can
strike him out with three pitches.

14:33.796 --> 14:36.295
If I do, we stay, you leave.

14:36.297 --> 14:40.232
If I don't,
you stay, we'll leave.

14:40.234 --> 14:44.436
You're serious?
Like Gloria Steinem.

14:44.937 --> 14:50.840
You're on, doll face. Tarq,
get my bat and my helmet.

14:56.380 --> 14:57.546
Mac, what are you doing?

14:57.548 --> 15:02.216
Getting rid of them. You just can't
take a bet like that by yourself.

15:02.218 --> 15:04.217
We all get a say. And?

15:04.219 --> 15:08.121
And my mom reads Ms. magazine.
What the hell is he talking about?

15:08.123 --> 15:13.459
Gloria Steinem writes that magazine.
It's serious women's liberation stuff.

15:13.461 --> 15:15.960
What the hell
is he talking about?

15:15.962 --> 15:17.262
I'm just saying, what if
the impossible happened?

15:17.264 --> 15:20.497
Like, somehow, she, like, threw three
pitches, and you didn't, like, hit one.

15:20.499 --> 15:26.569
Are you cracked? She's a girl.
This is baseball. I'm a man.

15:26.571 --> 15:28.837
Listen, she'll toss me a ball...

15:28.839 --> 15:33.474
I'll tag it four blocks, they'll go
home and all this junk will be over.

15:33.476 --> 15:36.510
Okay? Okay? Okay?

15:38.513 --> 15:41.147
Well?

15:48.121 --> 15:50.588
Now you're talking.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.833
Bring it on, skirt.

16:07.235 --> 16:10.903
Don't blink.

16:22.047 --> 16:27.015
What the... Come on.
Pitch it already.

16:34.157 --> 16:36.890
I call time.
What the hell was that?

16:36.892 --> 16:40.926
Come on. That's totally illegal.
You can't do that!

16:42.630 --> 16:46.297
You didn't even swing.

16:46.299 --> 16:50.001
Um, I kind of blinked.
Just tell me what happened.

16:50.003 --> 16:53.570
She smoked you, meathead.
You didn't even swing.

16:53.572 --> 16:56.939
I heard you
the first time, Tarqell.

16:56.941 --> 16:58.074
Swing? He didn't even see it.

16:58.076 --> 17:00.375
Oh, like you never took a strike before.
Not like that.

17:00.377 --> 17:04.412
I've never seen
anything like that before.

17:05.448 --> 17:09.616
Oh, my God, Hayley. They are so
embarrassed. They should be.

17:09.617 --> 17:14.586
How was I supposed to know that they
were a professional softball team?

17:14.588 --> 17:18.490
You go back up there, she'll mow
you down like a summer daisy.

17:18.492 --> 17:21.959
What are you now, a poet?

17:22.462 --> 17:27.464
Sam's pretty sure it's a violation
of the rules to pitch underhand.

17:27.465 --> 17:30.065
Hey! That one is cute.

17:30.067 --> 17:32.534
You can't do
that underhand pitch thing.

17:32.536 --> 17:35.470
It's against the rules of baseball.
I'm just tellin' ya.

17:35.472 --> 17:39.306
No, it's not.
There's no rule against it.

17:39.308 --> 17:43.609
So it's legal and fair.

17:43.611 --> 17:47.380
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

17:49.049 --> 17:52.450
We are officially screwed.

17:55.554 --> 17:59.922
No, we're not.

18:02.626 --> 18:05.059
Excuse me, what are you doing?

18:05.061 --> 18:07.961
Pinch-hitting. It's legal...

18:07.963 --> 18:10.997
and fair. Yeah, totally
legal andsfair.

18:10.999 --> 18:15.401
Don't worry, guys.
I got it. Go ahead.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.539
David's got it. It's over.
Solid.

18:34.952 --> 18:38.152
Whoa. Watch it. Foul ball.

18:48.395 --> 18:51.028
Foul ball.

19:06.009 --> 19:08.109
Foul ball.

19:20.220 --> 19:22.087
Come on.

19:22.089 --> 19:23.989
Foul ball.

19:25.558 --> 19:27.992
Foul ball.

19:56.416 --> 19:58.349
Well? "Well" what?

19:58.351 --> 20:02.485
I'm asking if you want to call the game
on account of it's gonna get dark soon.

20:02.487 --> 20:06.521
If you're too tired.
I didn't say I was tired.

20:06.523 --> 20:08.689
Uh, Hayley? What?

20:08.691 --> 20:11.458
Maybe we should call it.

20:11.460 --> 20:16.729
Until tomorrow, I mean. Yeah.
David, man, it's gonna get dark soon.

20:16.731 --> 20:20.432
It's a safety issue, you know.

20:20.434 --> 20:24.101
Hayley, come home. Dinnertime.

20:24.103 --> 20:26.203
Forfeit! That's a forfeit!

20:26.205 --> 20:30.440
David, time to take your bath.
It's a draw then.

20:32.777 --> 20:36.278
Hey, David. Your mom still
makes you take a bath at 6:00?

20:36.280 --> 20:41.215
Shut up, Saul.
Fine. Tomorrow then. Little baby.

20:41.217 --> 20:44.084
Count on it, spoiled brat.

21:24.085 --> 21:26.451
David, what are you doing?
Are you okay?

21:26.453 --> 21:30.154
What was that all about? Why
are you just sitting here?

21:30.156 --> 21:32.255
Come on. We're wasting time.
Let's go to the sandlot.

21:32.257 --> 21:34.624
David, we gotta go get Sammy.
Geez, what's the hurry?

21:34.626 --> 21:40.295
Why are his panties in a twist?
How am I supposed to know?

21:54.341 --> 21:57.275
Payback time, little turd.
It was an accident.

21:57.277 --> 22:00.111
You wrecked our field.
Now your ass is grass.

22:00.113 --> 22:04.379
What? I cleaned it up.
I made it better.

22:06.717 --> 22:09.550
It's true. The sandlot
never looked this good.

22:09.552 --> 22:12.420
He even dragged the baseline.
Okay, already, Saul.

22:12.422 --> 22:17.324
If Singleton told you to wreck the
field, why'd you clean it up?

22:17.326 --> 22:20.426
Who's Singleton?

22:21.395 --> 22:25.630
Little League team captain. The guy who
told you to mess up the sandlot...

22:25.632 --> 22:28.665
so we'd leave and him and his
team could take it for practice.

22:28.667 --> 22:34.570
Sir, I don't know no Singleton and I don't
know nothing about no Little League...

22:34.572 --> 22:37.540
and I don't play baseball.

22:37.542 --> 22:40.909
Rockets are my life, sir.
You ain't one of them?

22:40.911 --> 22:45.246
I don't even know
no "them," sir.

22:48.183 --> 22:53.285
What's your name?
Jonathan Buckminster Smalls.

22:53.287 --> 22:55.254
Hell of a name.

22:55.256 --> 22:58.256
So, you're friends with them.

23:01.294 --> 23:05.629
Kind of.
So you know we've got a situation.

23:05.631 --> 23:07.930
I guess.
"I guess"? Look, Bucky...

23:07.932 --> 23:13.468
Johnnie. Whatever. This is our
sandlot, and we've owned it for, like,

23:13.470 --> 23:14.202
a long time.

23:14.204 --> 23:19.840
Actually, most of us have only lived here
for a couple of years... except David.

23:19.842 --> 23:23.409
Shut up, Tarqell.
Like I said, a long time.

23:23.411 --> 23:26.711
Longer than those girls anyway.

23:26.713 --> 23:29.748
And so... And so... And so...

23:29.750 --> 23:30.848
"And so" what?

23:30.850 --> 23:33.717
I don't know. I'm out of words and stuff.
This is stupid.

23:33.719 --> 23:36.920
Johnnie, go over there
and tell them to leave.

23:37.856 --> 23:41.223
I don't think they...

23:43.594 --> 23:49.263
They said you have to leave. No.

23:51.333 --> 23:54.401
They aren't going to leave.

23:54.403 --> 23:57.836
Just tell 'em to leave.

23:58.773 --> 24:03.473
They really, really
need you to leave. No.

24:03.475 --> 24:07.777
They said no.
Tell them to leave.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.544
No.

24:09.546 --> 24:12.714
They aren't leaving. Again.

24:12.716 --> 24:16.350
No!

24:24.325 --> 24:27.826
He's done for, Captain.
What did they say?

24:27.828 --> 24:31.796
If they were boys,
we could beat 'em up.

24:31.798 --> 24:33.964
Well, they ain't and we can't.

24:33.966 --> 24:35.999
I have an idea.

24:36.001 --> 24:37.734
Share.

24:37.736 --> 24:41.837
Share the sandlot.
Play together.

24:41.839 --> 24:45.306
We could do that.
Are you all cracked?

24:45.308 --> 24:48.508
David, man. You know, like,
they're really good.

24:48.510 --> 24:53.679
Yeah. Really, really good, and we're
like four men short for a team.

24:53.681 --> 24:56.849
They're girls.
Yeah, but, so what?

24:56.851 --> 25:00.352
So what? You got us
into this crap-mess, Mac.

25:00.354 --> 25:04.021
A good soldier knows when to surrender.
I surrender.

25:04.023 --> 25:07.258
They're good. We need them.

25:07.459 --> 25:12.995
Let me put it this way. We want to
beat those Little League jerks, right?

25:12.997 --> 25:17.498
Well, them are the answer.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.944
Mac, go make a deal.

25:38.350 --> 25:41.018
Do they hate each other or what?
No.

25:41.020 --> 25:43.719
They are, like, totally in love.

25:43.721 --> 25:46.454
But why are they
always mad at each other?

25:46.456 --> 25:48.290
It's the same thing. Doy!

25:48.292 --> 25:50.924
Oh. Well, here's the deal.
We give.

25:50.926 --> 25:53.727
Really? Yeah, but you
got to be on our team.

25:53.729 --> 25:59.332
Really? Yeah. We need three
more guys, er, players.

25:59.334 --> 26:02.934
We got a big game coming up soon.
Deal.

26:02.936 --> 26:07.771
That is so disgusting.

26:07.773 --> 26:10.006
Oh, sorry.

26:23.419 --> 26:26.419
Sammy said the cookies are great.
Thank you.

26:26.421 --> 26:30.488
Can he have the recipe?
Sure, I'll write it down for you.

26:30.490 --> 26:34.458
The dugout's very tastefully done.
Thanks.

26:34.460 --> 26:35.826
Saul. What?

26:35.828 --> 26:39.996
Shut up.
Orange is my favorite color.

26:39.998 --> 26:43.965
Mine too. Ow! What?

26:46.003 --> 26:50.738
Is this freshly squeezed?
Yes. Thank you for noticing.

26:50.740 --> 26:53.540
Mac. What?

26:53.542 --> 26:55.442
Shut it.

26:55.444 --> 26:59.044
Anyway, this is Jenny and
this is Penny, and I'm...

26:59.046 --> 27:02.781
Hayley Goodfairer. We know.

27:02.783 --> 27:05.416
This is Tarqell, Mac,

27:05.418 --> 27:10.120
Saul and his brother Sam.

27:10.122 --> 27:12.489
We call him Fingers. He's deaf.

27:12.491 --> 27:16.392
Just look at him when you talk to him.
He can read lips.

27:16.394 --> 27:17.093
Okay.

27:17.095 --> 27:18.426
Hi.

27:18.428 --> 27:21.463
Let's reconnoiter these turkeys.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.130
Yeah.

27:22.132 --> 27:26.800
Come on, Singleton. Get a hit.

27:39.045 --> 27:41.011
Look, guys.
It's the sandlot retards.

27:41.013 --> 27:44.881
Singleton. That's enough, son. Get back
here. We've got a practice going on.

27:44.883 --> 27:48.083
Yeah, in a second, Coach.
But you said that last time,

27:48.085 --> 27:50.753
and then we stood around while you
cussed out the ice cream man.

27:50.755 --> 27:56.057
Back to practice.
Last time I coach my nephew.

27:58.594 --> 28:02.428
You guys bring your sisters to
watch some real ballplayers?

28:02.430 --> 28:03.662
Shut your mouth, Singleton.

28:03.664 --> 28:07.731
Actually, they're here to watch me wipe home
plate with that mop you call your hair.

28:07.733 --> 28:10.967
Sweeping up's all
you're good for, doughboy.

28:10.969 --> 28:14.737
Good thing you're switching to softball.
That's it! You're dead meat.

28:14.739 --> 28:17.439
Dead, I tell you! Dead!
Settle down, Mac.

28:17.441 --> 28:18.940
Now, calm yourself. I'm okay.
I'm okay.

28:18.942 --> 28:20.641
Yeah, right, roly-poly. Okay.

28:20.643 --> 28:25.879
Speaking of sweeping up, you girls keeping
our practice diamond all clean and tidy?

28:25.881 --> 28:28.715
Watch your mouth, jerk.
Shut up, porky.

28:28.717 --> 28:31.417
Lurch!
Your mama wears combat boots.

28:31.419 --> 28:34.886
Your mama's so ugly, when you
were born they slapped her.

28:34.888 --> 28:36.454
Gomer Pyle. Hippie.

28:36.456 --> 28:39.424
Shut up, porky.
You already said that, idiot.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.558
Yeah, well,
you're still fat, moron.

28:41.560 --> 28:46.495
You're a fart-sniffing,
road-apple-chewing,

28:46.497 --> 28:48.431
scab-licking female dog.

28:48.433 --> 28:52.100
I ain't done yet. You're ugly,
your mama dresses you funny,

28:52.102 --> 28:56.804
you stink like toe fungus and
you ride the short school bus.

28:56.806 --> 28:59.639
Yeah, well,
you play ball like a girl.

28:59.641 --> 29:01.507
Good one.

29:01.509 --> 29:04.976
Excuse me. What did you say?

29:04.978 --> 29:09.547
You heard me.
Friday. The sandlot.

29:09.549 --> 29:11.816
Be there, male chauvinist pig.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.650
Count on it, tomboy.

29:13.652 --> 29:17.787
Yeah. Be there, babies.

29:30.599 --> 29:32.599
We were proud of Mac that day.

29:32.601 --> 29:35.167
But he was so mad we had to take
him to the parking lot carnival...

29:35.169 --> 29:38.069
and stuff him full of cotton
candy just to calm him down.

29:38.071 --> 29:42.539
The carnival was the best place to go when
you wanted to get stuff off your mind.

29:42.541 --> 29:46.677
Because that's where you could see
the most amazing things on earth...

29:46.679 --> 29:49.045
for only 50 cents.

29:49.047 --> 29:49.979
Bigfoot crap?

29:49.981 --> 29:54.950
How in the hell are we supposed to
know what kind of crap that is?

29:54.952 --> 29:59.920
It could be dog crap.
It'd have to be one big dog.

29:59.922 --> 30:03.823
Yeah. And must've eaten a
whole bag of dog chow.

30:03.825 --> 30:07.125
Good we can't smell it.

30:07.127 --> 30:08.993
This is so lame. It's fake.

30:08.995 --> 30:13.630
It's still disgusting.

30:14.066 --> 30:17.666
Hey, guys,
there's more stuff back here.

30:20.638 --> 30:23.571
It was there that I got
my first clue...

30:23.573 --> 30:27.608
about how me and David
and Hayley were connected.

30:27.610 --> 30:31.511
Let me see. Mac, hit the button.

30:31.513 --> 30:34.747
It's just a bear.

30:34.749 --> 30:38.283
That is supposed to scare us?
Guys, what's in this one?

30:38.285 --> 30:41.886
I don't know. What is that?

31:08.175 --> 31:11.209
Is he okay? What's going on?

31:11.211 --> 31:13.244
Where'd he go?
It wasn't that scary.

31:13.246 --> 31:17.881
What happened?
Why'd he run out of there like that?

31:18.884 --> 31:23.019
David, you okay, man?
Yeah. Fine.

31:23.021 --> 31:26.655
I-I was just too hot in there.

31:26.924 --> 31:30.991
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's
hotter than snot.

31:30.993 --> 31:34.294
Let's get another soda
and ride some rides.

31:39.667 --> 31:44.702
Fine. Go to the bathroom.
But meet us at the Tilt-A-Whirl.

31:44.938 --> 31:50.907
Mom made me promise to make sure you
stay away from the kissing booth.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.576
You understand?

31:52.578 --> 31:56.745
Don't even think about
going over there. Serious.

31:56.747 --> 31:59.180
Okay, go.

32:13.359 --> 32:15.759
Bye.

32:19.364 --> 32:23.732
Just one.

32:46.885 --> 32:50.786
Sweetie,
aren't you a little young?

32:51.222 --> 32:54.957
Say, kid, did your
mother say it was okay?

32:56.827 --> 32:59.060
Just on the cheek, okay?

33:16.743 --> 33:17.341
Oh, my God!

33:17.343 --> 33:19.310
What's wrong? Get the bikes!

33:19.312 --> 33:20.977
Hey. Hey.

33:23.081 --> 33:27.783
Now I remember that kid. That's
the same kid as last year.

33:29.653 --> 33:32.220
Pervert! God, he stole my gum!

33:32.222 --> 33:36.056
We never mentioned that night again because
it was just too terrible to think...

33:36.058 --> 33:39.792
what would've happened if
that guy had caught Fingers...

33:39.794 --> 33:42.995
But mostly because of
what happened the next day...

33:42.997 --> 33:43.995
Play ball!

33:43.997 --> 33:47.832
When we finally had to play the biggest
game of our lives. Don't blink.

33:47.834 --> 33:55.238
It was winner take all, and the prize was
nothing less than the sandlot itself.

33:56.307 --> 33:58.407
Did you see that? Is that legal?

33:58.409 --> 34:00.976
Sorry. You need me to
call that for you? Strike!

34:00.978 --> 34:06.814
Shut up, doughnut belly. That's illegal.
You can't pitch like that.

34:06.816 --> 34:10.116
It's legal.
Get used to disappointment.

34:10.118 --> 34:14.052
You can hit it. Come on.

34:18.857 --> 34:19.922
Aw! Yeah.

34:19.925 --> 34:24.393
You're out. Next victim.
You suck.

34:36.138 --> 34:38.404
Sit down.

34:57.254 --> 35:00.089
Come on, you idiot. Throw it in.

35:01.791 --> 35:06.059
That day I witnessed the beginning
of the most important thing in life:

35:06.061 --> 35:09.396
first love. Throw it!

35:11.399 --> 35:17.035
When Singleton realized he was gonna
lose, he did something so wrong,

35:17.037 --> 35:22.806
that David took his first step
down the road of greatness.

35:32.816 --> 35:34.915
You're out. Are you cracked?

35:34.917 --> 35:36.784
What'd you do that for,
you jive turkey?

35:36.786 --> 35:42.388
She wants to play with the big
boys, that's what she gets.

35:49.163 --> 35:53.264
The sandlot's ours... forever.
Don't mess with my teammates.

35:53.266 --> 35:55.465
And you never, ever
hit a girl, creep!

35:55.467 --> 36:00.035
Like most great things, David
hadn't planned what he did.

36:00.037 --> 36:03.038
It was a force of nature inside him,
and he did what nature intended.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.875
He came to Hayley's defense. Later, though,
he would have to make a decision...

36:06.877 --> 36:13.046
whether or not to come to Hayley's
rescue like a knight in shining armor...

36:13.048 --> 36:16.181
Great hit, Hayley.
Really showed them.

36:16.183 --> 36:17.215
And face his greatest fear:

36:17.217 --> 36:21.485
a deadly force of nature that I
accidentally turned loose...

36:21.487 --> 36:24.454
on the 99th day
of the summer of 1972.

36:24.456 --> 36:29.124
That was a really great hit she made.
Almost went all the way over.

36:29.126 --> 36:34.529
Can't be done, Smalls. No one's ever
hit a ball over that junk wall.

36:34.531 --> 36:37.198
Ever? Nope. Too high.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.900
Man, Evil Knievel
couldn't even jump that wall.

36:39.902 --> 36:44.436
You knock one off that dryer,
that's about as good as it gets.

36:53.946 --> 36:56.547
The nightmare started
one week later...

36:56.549 --> 37:00.983
when Mac got a new kind of bat
for his birthday.

37:00.985 --> 37:02.450
It was made of aluminum,

37:02.452 --> 37:09.456
and he finally did what no one
had ever been able to do before.

37:18.132 --> 37:21.966
Yeah! Are you taking notes?

37:21.968 --> 37:25.102
Smalls, did you see that?
See what?

37:25.104 --> 37:28.138
That homer. Kid, it was far out.

37:28.140 --> 37:31.240
I'll get the ball back and I'll
hit another one so you can see.

37:31.242 --> 37:33.442
That was incredible.
I get to try the bat next, Mac.

37:33.444 --> 37:38.580
We can get the ball back.
There's got to be some way over that wall.

37:38.582 --> 37:41.949
No! Stop!

37:41.951 --> 37:45.384
You guys, over here. No!

37:45.386 --> 37:50.021
No! Stop!
What are you all doing?

37:50.023 --> 37:53.225
What are we all doing? Smalls,
you're the one freaking out.

37:53.227 --> 37:57.328
Bucky, you're acting a fool. Just
step aside so we can get our ball.

37:57.330 --> 38:00.530
It's Johnnie,
and I said stay back!

38:00.532 --> 38:05.267
You might wanna put those away
before you hurt yourself, Smalls.

38:06.470 --> 38:09.104
Oh, my gosh. None of you knows.

38:09.106 --> 38:10.271
Knows about what?

38:10.273 --> 38:13.074
Tarqell, you said you guys
have only been...

38:13.076 --> 38:16.242
coming here together
for, like, a year, right?

38:16.244 --> 38:21.179
And, David, you said no one's ever
hit a ball over the junk wall.

38:21.181 --> 38:25.148
Right? Right. Mac's the first.

38:25.150 --> 38:30.019
Johnnie, what in the hell are you
babbling about? The Great Fear.

38:30.021 --> 38:32.154
Spawned by the Beast.

38:32.156 --> 38:34.556
Go over there real slowly,

38:34.558 --> 38:40.127
and look through
that old dryer and be quiet.

38:40.129 --> 38:42.429
No, no, no. Only one.

39:24.264 --> 39:28.465
What was that thing?
The Great Fear.

39:28.467 --> 39:32.001
Like, what does that mean,
"The Great Fear"?

39:32.003 --> 39:35.171
It's a long story.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.309
Bivouac.

39:53.087 --> 39:57.221
All those who know this tale have
grown up and left the neighborhood.

39:57.223 --> 40:02.192
But my brother, Scotty, was there.
He told me the main stuff.

40:02.194 --> 40:06.195
A kid named Benny "The Jet"
Rodriguez battled the Beast,

40:06.197 --> 40:12.233
a dog named Hercules, to get back a
baseball worth about a million bucks.

40:12.235 --> 40:15.202
Benny won.
Hercules got old and died.

40:15.204 --> 40:19.972
Where his story ends is where the
story of the Great Fear begins.

40:19.974 --> 40:26.310
Around six years ago, before he
died, Hercules made some baby dogs.

40:28.982 --> 40:32.415
One pup was different.

40:34.151 --> 40:41.222
He had big feet and big teeth
and he didn't like no one.

40:43.059 --> 40:48.761
He was born to bite,
and so nobody wanted him.

40:48.763 --> 40:51.597
For years the pup stayed in
the backyard,

40:51.599 --> 40:55.166
looking under the gate
to watch kids walking by.

40:55.168 --> 40:58.769
Kids he wanted to bite.
But there was no way out.

40:58.771 --> 41:03.306
With his big feet,
he started to dig.

41:03.308 --> 41:08.577
The digging made him grow huge.
Being alone made him grow mean.

41:08.579 --> 41:14.482
And then the little kid moved into the
neighborhood, and he was six years old.

41:14.484 --> 41:18.785
His favorite hero
was the Rapid Rocket.

41:18.787 --> 41:24.156
So the little kid believed he was
as fast as a speeding rocket.

41:24.158 --> 41:29.060
On his first day of school, he walked
right past Mr. Mertle's house.

41:29.062 --> 41:33.663
The night before,
Mr. Mertle didn't lock the gate.

41:39.203 --> 41:45.673
And that's when the freak-of-nature
pup became known as the Great Fear.

41:45.675 --> 41:49.743
Because the little kid looked
at it, and he was afraid.

41:49.745 --> 41:54.580
And because
he could smell your fear.

42:47.657 --> 42:52.225
After he got bit by the Great
Fear, the little kid disappeared.

42:52.227 --> 42:54.860
Some say he hops around
on one leg.

42:54.862 --> 42:58.163
Some say the Great Fear
ate him whole.

42:58.165 --> 43:00.198
And some say his parents
moved him away...

43:00.200 --> 43:07.437
'cause he got infected with the Great
Fear's spit and never talked again.

43:07.439 --> 43:08.737
He barked.

43:08.739 --> 43:14.609
After that, Mr. Mertle chained the Great
Fear up to a battleship anchor...

43:14.611 --> 43:17.345
so he could never
get out again...

43:17.347 --> 43:20.481
and never bite kids no more.

43:20.483 --> 43:22.850
And all on account of being
chained up forever,

43:22.852 --> 43:27.587
the Great Fear's brain
got twisted, and he went insane.

43:27.589 --> 43:32.857
And that's why he still digs,
'cause there's no way out.

43:32.859 --> 43:35.693
But he believes there is.

43:36.596 --> 43:41.197
Bucky, that's a hell of a story.

43:41.199 --> 43:42.798
It's the truth.

43:42.800 --> 43:44.833
Like, you've got a great
imagination and all,

43:44.835 --> 43:49.637
but we're a little old
to believe in scary stories.

43:49.639 --> 43:50.505
But, it's all the truth.

43:50.507 --> 43:58.505
We're all, like, 12, and you're, well, you
know, just still in the fourth grade.

43:59.413 --> 44:01.546
That was a great story.
Great story.

44:01.548 --> 44:05.750
You sure got
a great imagination, man.

44:09.722 --> 44:14.190
Wait. Look.

44:16.660 --> 44:20.695
You know what that looks like?
We all see it, Mac. Shut up.

44:20.697 --> 44:23.429
You know what that sounded like?

44:23.431 --> 44:27.566
We all heard it, Mac.
Shut up. Bigfoot.

44:27.768 --> 44:31.202
The junk wall wasn't built
to keep things out.

44:31.204 --> 44:34.405
It was built to keep
some thing in.

44:34.407 --> 44:37.707
What? No one really knows.

44:37.709 --> 44:42.645
Some kind of mutated,
insane, bigfoot dog thing.

44:42.647 --> 44:44.246
But this much is certain.

44:44.248 --> 44:49.684
Since the time of the little kid,
nothing has gone over that fence.

44:49.686 --> 44:55.188
But if something ever did
and anyone tried to go get it,

44:55.190 --> 44:58.357
no one would ever
see them again.

44:59.327 --> 45:02.427
They'd become dog chow...

45:02.429 --> 45:04.828
for the Great Fear.

45:21.578 --> 45:23.710
Back then, fireworks
were safe and sane.

45:23.712 --> 45:26.580
You heard stories about kids
getting their fingers blown off,

45:26.582 --> 45:29.381
but we never knew anyone that
that had actually happened to.

45:29.383 --> 45:33.418
Those accidents were caused by
firecrackers, not safe and sane fireworks.

45:33.420 --> 45:36.588
You didn't even have to have your
parents with you to buy them.

45:36.590 --> 45:38.922
But the one thing
your parents always said was,

45:38.924 --> 45:42.593
"Don't spend all your money
on the Rocket Riot."

45:42.595 --> 45:45.728
Two Rocket Riots, please.

45:46.898 --> 45:49.397
I've been saving for two years.

45:49.399 --> 45:54.702
Chores, collecting bottles,
birthday money.

45:54.704 --> 45:55.769
Here, help me with this.

45:55.771 --> 46:01.574
Bucky, what in the hell are you
gonna do with two Rocket Riots?

46:01.576 --> 46:06.345
Celebrate the birth of our
great country, of course.

46:06.347 --> 46:11.716
Oh, and I'm going to
turn night into day.

46:29.664 --> 46:31.463
It's about time.

46:31.465 --> 46:33.798
We gonna play ball or what?

46:33.800 --> 46:36.900
David, man, it's so hot out.

46:36.902 --> 46:39.403
I'm not even
supposed to be here.

46:39.405 --> 46:44.407
My mom said if I play ball
in this heat, I'll get fungus.

46:44.409 --> 46:48.744
What happened to playing baseball
all day, every day? All summer.

46:48.746 --> 46:51.345
Come on, David. It's hot.

46:51.347 --> 46:54.882
Hey, do you guys
wanna go swimming?

47:00.888 --> 47:03.689
Oh, yeah. All right.

47:03.691 --> 47:08.660
Because of it being so hot that
day and because of Hayley's pool,

47:08.662 --> 47:12.896
I got another clue about how me and
David and Hayley were connected...

47:12.898 --> 47:18.501
for the one moment later that summer
when I would change the fortunes of all.

47:20.904 --> 47:25.839
Aren't you gonna go swimming?

47:25.841 --> 47:28.542
No, it's stupid.
Girls ruin everything.

47:28.544 --> 47:31.811
Even with that clue, I couldn't
put it all together yet.

47:31.813 --> 47:36.615
But I would soon enough, and like
all great moments in history,

47:36.617 --> 47:40.017
it would be
at the very last minute.

47:41.754 --> 47:43.387
Johnnie. Yeah?

47:43.389 --> 47:46.923
Isn't David
gonna come swimming too?

47:46.925 --> 47:50.793
Mmm, I don't think so.

47:51.829 --> 47:56.798
Maybe he will later though.

47:57.934 --> 48:01.001
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on.

48:01.003 --> 48:04.103
Come on. Hurry up.
There he goes.

48:19.884 --> 48:21.918
Hey, big guy. What's the matter?

48:21.920 --> 48:24.720
I thought he liked me.
What's the matter with me?

48:24.722 --> 48:28.955
Oh, tiger, there is absolutely nothing
wrong with you. You are perfect.

48:28.957 --> 48:35.461
A woman needs a man
like a fish needs a bicycle.

48:35.463 --> 48:39.430
Hmm? Oh, great. Thanks, Mom.

48:39.432 --> 48:42.899
Anytime, big guy.

49:02.751 --> 49:04.784
Johnnie, right?

49:04.786 --> 49:07.586
Uh, yes.
My name is Johnnie, sir.

49:07.588 --> 49:10.421
You know, I gotta go away
on business next week,

49:10.423 --> 49:12.123
so, why don't you
come over Friday morning,

49:12.125 --> 49:17.427
and you and me will take my project
for a test flight before I go.

49:17.429 --> 49:18.661
Me, sir? Yeah, sure.

49:18.663 --> 49:21.830
I mean, you can set it up and you
can launch it if you want to.

49:21.832 --> 49:26.868
Rockets are your life, right?
Affirmative.

49:26.870 --> 49:29.903
Affirm... Yeah.

49:31.940 --> 49:34.607
You know, Johnnie,
my wife and my daughter,

49:34.609 --> 49:40.145
they're not so impressed with all
my, uh, science junk in the garage.

49:40.147 --> 49:43.815
It'd be nice to share it with
somebody who truly appreciates it.

49:43.817 --> 49:47.851
I'll be here, sir. No. Don't call me sir.
It's Roger.

49:47.853 --> 49:50.052
Roger. Wilco. Over and out.

49:50.054 --> 49:58.053
It's a little NASA humor. Okay, so
we'll-we'll see you on Friday, right?

49:58.195 --> 50:01.095
Count on it, sir, er, Roger.

50:01.097 --> 50:03.496
Come on, Johnnie.
Johnnie, come on.

50:10.771 --> 50:13.137
Come on, Johnnie.

50:56.773 --> 51:00.074
That's what it was all about
when I was a kid.

51:00.076 --> 51:02.075
Baseball, summer,
rockets and fireworks.

51:02.077 --> 51:04.644
They went together
like hot dogs and soda.

51:04.646 --> 51:08.013
The only difference between us
and the big leaguers...

51:08.015 --> 51:10.749
was that we weren't playing
at Dodger Stadium.

51:10.751 --> 51:13.585
We were playing
someplace better.

51:45.578 --> 51:48.045
Happy birthday, U.S.A.

51:58.856 --> 52:04.157
Hey. W-Where's Hayley? I thought she was
coming to the, uh, airport with us.

52:04.159 --> 52:09.095
She's over at Penny and Jenny's and she
says she loves you. Now, let's go.

52:09.097 --> 52:12.899
Take it easy now.
Easy, easy, easy, ea...

52:22.808 --> 52:28.211
Hello, Mr. Good... I mean, Roger.
It's Friday morning.

52:28.213 --> 52:32.313
It's me, Johnnie. I'm here.

53:02.071 --> 53:08.041
Be nice to share it with somebody
who truly appreciates it.

53:08.043 --> 53:11.710
You can set it up and you can
launch it if you want to.

53:11.712 --> 53:15.747
Rockets are your life, right?

53:15.749 --> 53:17.982
Right.

53:53.179 --> 53:56.913
Might as well get it
completely ready, I guess.

54:17.898 --> 54:21.132
You are one
lucky astronaut, Jake.

55:11.140 --> 55:14.807
Oh, my God.

55:25.217 --> 55:28.785
Honey... We cannot go back.

56:49.516 --> 56:52.117
Hi, Johnnie. Whatcha doing?

56:52.119 --> 56:56.520
Hi. Uh, just cleaning up
the sandlot.

56:56.522 --> 56:59.188
Lots of work to do. See ya.

56:59.190 --> 57:02.425
Oh. My dad had to go
on his trip a week early.

57:02.427 --> 57:07.295
He said to tell you he's sorry he missed
your meeting, whatever that means.

57:07.297 --> 57:12.433
But you guys can do your
"mission," whatever that means,

57:12.435 --> 57:14.934
as soon as he gets back.

57:14.936 --> 57:18.337
Oh. Okay. Great.

57:18.339 --> 57:20.973
Oh. I almost forgot.
Everyone's coming over tomorrow.

57:20.975 --> 57:25.276
My dad's gonna be on television
talking about his rocket.

57:25.278 --> 57:27.544
Really?

57:27.546 --> 57:30.213
Gee, that's super.

57:30.215 --> 57:34.884
Well, it's... it's been a long
and difficult design process,

57:34.886 --> 57:37.252
but after two years...
That is so cool.

57:37.254 --> 57:39.154
Of, uh, hard work,

57:39.156 --> 57:42.790
uh, we'll be launching
a model of the...

57:42.792 --> 57:43.524
Space shuttle very soon.

57:43.526 --> 57:48.261
The work that my team and I
have... have done is undoubtedly...

57:48.263 --> 57:51.430
Awesome! Hayley, I didn't
know your dad was famous.

57:51.432 --> 57:53.198
Neither did I.

57:53.200 --> 57:56.067
My team and myself is...

57:56.069 --> 57:57.067
"He must be a genius."

57:57.069 --> 58:00.104
I guess it's not just science junk
in the garage after all, is it, Mom?

58:00.106 --> 58:04.140
No, it isn't, honey. Your daddy
is a very important man.

58:04.142 --> 58:07.042
I think it's safe to say
that this could be...

58:07.044 --> 58:10.945
the most important
piece of engineering...

58:10.947 --> 58:14.081
in the history of mankind.

58:14.083 --> 58:17.417
Sorry. I have to go. Uh, well...

58:19.154 --> 58:20.387
What's he doing?

58:20.389 --> 58:27.458
Well, uh, maybe the shock of knowing some
famous science dude was just too much for him.

58:27.460 --> 58:33.964
Like, wow, Smalls, I don't remember you
setting off a firecracker this big!

58:33.966 --> 58:37.299
Smalls, what are you looking at?

58:37.301 --> 58:41.268
Johnnie?

58:41.270 --> 58:43.871
Wow. What's that?

58:44.240 --> 58:47.607
Up there. That speck.

58:50.044 --> 58:53.212
It's not a U.F.O., meathead.

58:53.214 --> 58:55.613
Wait. Is it?

58:56.416 --> 58:59.249
It looks exactly like...

58:59.551 --> 59:05.020
Johnnie, please, please tell me you
didn't set off my dad's rocket.

59:05.022 --> 59:07.489
It was an accident. I swear!

59:07.491 --> 59:10.258
Oh, my God.

59:24.638 --> 59:27.372
Oh, my God!

59:45.021 --> 59:47.088
Ew!

59:47.090 --> 59:52.192
Smalls, you mean to tell me that
you launched a scale model...

59:52.194 --> 59:54.627
of the NASA space shuttle
on purpose?

59:54.629 --> 01:00:00.565
No. Hayley's dad said that me and him
were going to, but he didn't come, and...

01:00:00.567 --> 01:00:02.199
It was an accident! I swear!

01:00:02.201 --> 01:00:07.370
It's the greatest feat of engineering
in the history of mankind!

01:00:07.372 --> 01:00:12.240
"The future of the United States space
program depends on that thing!"

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:14.676
And if I may add myself,
it's worth, well,

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:18.045
more than
your whole life, Smalls!

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:21.547
I don't feel so good.

01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:23.416
Give him room. Give him air.

01:00:23.418 --> 01:00:28.453
We've gotta get that shuttle back.
My dad is gonna kill me!

01:00:32.392 --> 01:00:35.159
David, where are you going?

01:00:35.161 --> 01:00:37.493
Home. Aren't you gonna help?

01:00:37.495 --> 01:00:41.596
Forget it.
You'll never get it back.

01:00:41.598 --> 01:00:43.665
It's gone.

01:00:43.667 --> 01:00:46.466
Forever.

01:00:52.307 --> 01:00:55.473
Hayley, when's your dad
getting back?

01:00:55.475 --> 01:00:59.044
In five days. Five days!

01:00:59.046 --> 01:01:01.078
That's an impenetrable fortress!

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.615
We can't get the shuttle back
in five days!

01:01:04.617 --> 01:01:06.482
It's impossible!

01:01:06.484 --> 01:01:08.551
Smalls, never say die.

01:01:08.553 --> 01:01:12.120
Nothing is impossible.
Follow me.

01:01:25.533 --> 01:01:27.967
It's impossible.

01:01:27.969 --> 01:01:29.600
What happened to
"never say die"?

01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:33.504
Why don't we just go and ask Mr.
Mertle to get it for us?

01:01:33.506 --> 01:01:34.504
Are you nuts?

01:01:34.506 --> 01:01:39.408
He's the one that left his gate open
so the Great Fear could get out...

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:42.278
and chase the little kid
and bite him dead!

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.679
Forget about it.

01:01:45.248 --> 01:01:48.315
Anybody got any genius ideas?

01:01:50.353 --> 01:01:53.252
Like my brother Scotty
before me, I was a science whiz.

01:01:53.254 --> 01:02:00.726
A mechanical genius. And so, things started
right at the top of the idea food chain.

01:02:00.728 --> 01:02:03.294
Okay. Let's go.

01:02:09.001 --> 01:02:11.234
Okay, it's clear.

01:02:20.777 --> 01:02:23.510
Okay. We got it.

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:49.597
Apparently I've made a crucial
"mis-assessment" of the Great Fear.

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.731
I've got tons more toys at home,

01:02:51.733 --> 01:02:59.538
but I'm afraid they're no match for the
sort of evil power we're dealing with.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.073
We have an idea.

01:03:04.511 --> 01:03:07.644
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

01:03:07.646 --> 01:03:10.379
You wanna get it back,
don't you?

01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:11.647
Yeah, but...

01:03:11.649 --> 01:03:13.115
She'll be fine.

01:03:13.117 --> 01:03:15.550
We'll lower her over the fence,
right on top of the shuttle.

01:03:15.552 --> 01:03:18.753
Her claws'll grab it, and we'll
just pull her back over gently.

01:03:18.755 --> 01:03:22.289
But her claws only come out
when she's scared.

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:23.724
Exactly.

01:03:23.726 --> 01:03:25.258
Oh.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.294
Forward.

01:03:31.465 --> 01:03:34.365
Okay. Farther.

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:46.208
Keep on going.

01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:54.414
Stop.

01:03:55.818 --> 01:03:58.417
Okay. A little bit farther.

01:03:58.419 --> 01:04:00.686
We're gonna get that shuttle.
We're gonna get it.

01:04:00.688 --> 01:04:04.622
I know. We're gonna get it.

01:04:04.624 --> 01:04:07.425
Lower her down.

01:04:14.332 --> 01:04:17.766
A little bit lower.

01:04:21.371 --> 01:04:23.871
I think we got it.

01:04:27.709 --> 01:04:31.211
Pull her up! Pull her up!

01:04:41.787 --> 01:04:43.786
Miss Susan B.!

01:04:43.788 --> 01:04:45.621
Oh, no.

01:04:45.623 --> 01:04:49.124
Pull her up! Haul her up!

01:05:01.768 --> 01:05:07.671
In the movies, this is the part where the
reinforcements are supposed to arrive.

01:05:07.673 --> 01:05:09.640
Supposed to.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.215
Who's that?
Want to get that thing back?

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:24.385
You talk to me.

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:26.920
I've seen that kid
before in school.

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:32.458
Yeah. I've seen him around school too.
His dad drives a chopper.

01:05:35.695 --> 01:05:38.763
Kid, who are you?

01:05:38.765 --> 01:05:40.564
Shh.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.766
They call me the Retriever.

01:05:42.768 --> 01:05:46.536
What's that supposed to mean?

01:05:46.538 --> 01:05:48.905
When I was little,

01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:51.673
my Frisbee went over
a neighbor's fence.

01:05:51.675 --> 01:05:54.608
I retrieved it, but their dog...

01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:58.546
used it as a chew toy
and ruined it.

01:05:58.548 --> 01:06:00.813
So I took his name tag.

01:06:00.815 --> 01:06:02.882
It's what I do. I'm a retriever.

01:06:02.884 --> 01:06:05.350
The Great Fear
is the ultimate challenge.

01:06:05.352 --> 01:06:07.553
No stupid dog
can match my skill.

01:06:07.555 --> 01:06:10.655
But there's no way
over that junk wall.

01:06:10.657 --> 01:06:12.623
I want that dog tag!

01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:15.358
And I'll get
your shuttle back too.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.360
Deal?

01:06:19.463 --> 01:06:20.429
Deal.

01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:25.733
Close the fence after me,
and no matter what you hear,

01:06:25.735 --> 01:06:27.969
no matter what I say,

01:06:27.971 --> 01:06:31.705
do notsopen this board.

01:06:31.707 --> 01:06:34.273
Understand?

01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:53.621
No matter what.
Don't worry. We got it.

01:06:53.623 --> 01:06:55.790
We completely understand.

01:06:55.792 --> 01:06:58.358
Hold on tighter.
Little higher. Get the corner.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.560
Got it?
Everybody lean against it.

01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:02.728
Okay. Let me out. Hello.

01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:04.763
Let him out.
He must have forgot something.

01:07:04.765 --> 01:07:06.864
Guys, hurry up. Let him out.

01:07:06.866 --> 01:07:11.236
What part of "no matter what"
did you not understand?

01:07:11.238 --> 01:07:14.705
It won't happen again.

01:07:14.707 --> 01:07:16.472
Rookies. Amateurs.

01:07:16.474 --> 01:07:18.975
Hayley, I got a good
feeling about him.

01:07:18.977 --> 01:07:20.776
I think your worries are over.

01:07:20.778 --> 01:07:23.678
No dog alive can measure
up to that kid.

01:07:26.315 --> 01:07:30.984
Hello. I was kidding.
Aaah! Let me out!

01:07:30.986 --> 01:07:32.485
Should we let him out?
I'm not kidding!

01:07:32.487 --> 01:07:35.921
No. You heard what he said.
You want that shuttle back, right?

01:07:35.923 --> 01:07:38.457
For the love of God! Help!

01:07:38.459 --> 01:07:41.025
Well, keep holding it shut.
Let me out!

01:07:42.662 --> 01:07:46.296
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy. Good puppy.

01:07:51.302 --> 01:07:56.838
Aaah!

01:08:10.384 --> 01:08:12.651
I don't know what that thing is,

01:08:12.653 --> 01:08:14.918
but that's no dog.

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.421
What was it? What's back there?

01:08:18.424 --> 01:08:24.660
Some kind of mutated
bigfoot insane dog thing.

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:29.397
I'm officially retiring.

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:31.299
You're on your own.

01:08:31.301 --> 01:08:37.304
Good luck, but you'll never
get that shuttle back.

01:08:38.872 --> 01:08:42.875
Um, here's your stuff.

01:08:54.685 --> 01:08:56.051
Nothing we tried had worked.

01:08:56.053 --> 01:09:02.022
The Great Fear was, we thought, clearly
aided by some evil force from beyond.

01:09:02.024 --> 01:09:06.725
In other words, we were out of
ideas, and I was dead meat.

01:09:06.728 --> 01:09:08.627
Until Mac had an epiphany.

01:09:08.629 --> 01:09:12.462
Which, since it was such a girlie
word, he didn't have many of,

01:09:12.465 --> 01:09:14.765
but this time
it was really important.

01:09:14.767 --> 01:09:18.734
I gotta take a ride.
I need to think.

01:09:23.974 --> 01:09:29.042
Seventy-five cents for a ticket?
That's ridiculous.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:36.582
That's it!

01:09:40.921 --> 01:09:43.787
We dig. All right. I'm goin' in.

01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:48.359
But if I say pull me out,
you guys better pull me out.

01:09:48.361 --> 01:09:49.827
Don't worry.
We got you right here.

01:09:49.828 --> 01:09:52.895
Don't worry, Mac. We got it.

01:09:57.401 --> 01:09:59.868
Pull me out!

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:03.504
Sure. Don't worry, man.

01:10:03.506 --> 01:10:05.739
Godspeed, Mac.

01:10:17.617 --> 01:10:20.050
Give me my bat.

01:10:20.819 --> 01:10:23.120
Here you go.

01:11:28.639 --> 01:11:29.771
Aaah!

01:11:29.773 --> 01:11:32.606
Tunnel King, this is base.
What's happening?

01:11:32.608 --> 01:11:36.444
Over.

01:11:37.145 --> 01:11:41.847
Okay. I see it.
I'm initiating manual evac.

01:11:41.849 --> 01:11:42.848
You're what?

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:45.751
I'm gonna reach up,
grab the hook and attach it.

01:11:45.753 --> 01:11:48.219
Oh. Yeah. Okay. Oh!

01:12:00.865 --> 01:12:02.597
What's that?

01:12:07.069 --> 01:12:09.069
Hey. I got it.

01:12:10.005 --> 01:12:13.473
I got it. Nice!

01:12:13.475 --> 01:12:15.074
Oops.

01:12:26.918 --> 01:12:29.586
What vibrations?

01:12:38.261 --> 01:12:40.760
Abort. Repeat.

01:12:40.762 --> 01:12:43.063
Abort mission.

01:12:43.065 --> 01:12:44.630
Abort!

01:12:44.632 --> 01:12:46.931
What the hell is that?

01:12:52.505 --> 01:12:54.071
Aaah!

01:12:54.073 --> 01:12:55.137
Aaah!

01:12:55.139 --> 01:12:59.207
Aaah! Aaah!

01:13:02.546 --> 01:13:03.777
Aaah!

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:04.211
Aaah!

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:08.048
Get me out of here! Get
me out of here! Aaah!

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:13.019
Oh! Pull! Pull!

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:16.188
Aaah! Get me out of here! Aaah!

01:13:18.825 --> 01:13:21.592
Come on.

01:13:23.562 --> 01:13:25.322
It's coming! It's coming!

01:13:49.149 --> 01:13:53.851
What is that? What's that smell?

01:13:53.853 --> 01:13:56.654
Oh, no. Johnnie.

01:13:58.056 --> 01:13:59.923
Whatever that thing was,

01:13:59.925 --> 01:14:04.293
it's worse than anything
you could ever imagine.

01:14:04.295 --> 01:14:06.627
It almost killed me.

01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:08.996
It was evil.

01:14:11.334 --> 01:14:14.801
A good soldier knows
when to surrender.

01:14:14.803 --> 01:14:17.603
I'm a good soldier.

01:14:17.605 --> 01:14:21.339
And I crapped my pants.

01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:23.908
So, Hayley, good luck,

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:28.579
but our work here is done.

01:14:29.248 --> 01:14:32.715
Badly, but done.

01:14:33.084 --> 01:14:37.852
I just hope your dad
isn't too mad.

01:15:04.342 --> 01:15:07.008
It was the lowest point
of the summer.

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:11.645
I had single-handedly destroyed
America's future in space.

01:15:11.647 --> 01:15:14.180
But it's when
they're at their lowest point...

01:15:14.182 --> 01:15:17.683
that great men
take great action.

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:27.324
I'm really sorry, Hayley. I'll
make sure I take all the blame.

01:15:27.326 --> 01:15:29.792
Can I ask you something?

01:15:29.794 --> 01:15:32.328
Sure. I guess.

01:15:32.897 --> 01:15:35.297
It's just where's David?

01:15:35.299 --> 01:15:37.232
I thought he'd come back.

01:15:37.234 --> 01:15:40.768
Because, you know,
I thought he...

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:43.637
Never mind. Forget it.
It's stupid.

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:46.272
It's not stupid. He does.

01:15:46.274 --> 01:15:48.007
Does what?

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:50.309
Likes you.

01:15:51.045 --> 01:15:52.910
He does? Duh.

01:15:52.912 --> 01:15:54.679
Then how come he never said?

01:15:54.681 --> 01:15:58.782
Boys don't do that.
Did you ever tell him?

01:16:01.754 --> 01:16:04.120
Could you tell him for me?

01:16:04.122 --> 01:16:04.987
Why?

01:16:04.989 --> 01:16:08.223
Because he's the fastest boy
I ever saw,

01:16:08.225 --> 01:16:12.893
and I thought maybe
he could, you know...

01:16:12.895 --> 01:16:15.796
Forget it. It's stupid.

01:16:20.335 --> 01:16:22.734
No. It's not stupid.

01:16:22.736 --> 01:16:26.438
Wait here. I'll be back.

01:16:28.041 --> 01:16:30.274
It was right at that moment...

01:16:30.276 --> 01:16:32.008
that I finally put
all the pieces together...

01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:37.279
and understood how me and Hayley
and David were all connected.

01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:57.261
Nike was the winged goddess
of victory in Greek mythology.

01:16:57.263 --> 01:16:59.730
She sat at the side of Zeus,
the ruler of Olympus.

01:16:59.732 --> 01:17:06.201
She inspired the most courageous and chivalrous
warriors at the dawn of civilization.

01:17:06.203 --> 01:17:07.269
David, man, this is bad news.

01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:13.441
David Vincent Durango
was a chivalrous warrior.

01:17:13.443 --> 01:17:17.844
Yeah, David.
Like, it's the baddest.

01:17:36.461 --> 01:17:38.260
David, wait. It was my fault.

01:17:38.262 --> 01:17:43.331
I made a big mistake.
You don't have to do this.

01:17:45.968 --> 01:17:48.368
Yeah, I do, Smalls.

01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:51.003
I have to do this.

01:17:56.076 --> 01:18:01.879
Oh, my God. You're him, aren't you?
You're the little kid from the story.

01:18:19.762 --> 01:18:22.862
Just do it.

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:26.766
I'll man the cable.
You guys stay here.

01:21:14.565 --> 01:21:17.498
We got it! We pulled it over!
Fantastic!

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.967
Whoo!

01:21:19.969 --> 01:21:22.168
All right!

01:21:23.005 --> 01:21:26.171
Nice job!
I knew you could do it!

01:21:28.075 --> 01:21:31.309
Look!

01:21:31.311 --> 01:21:34.178
Holy crap!

01:21:49.326 --> 01:21:51.292
What are we waiting for?
Let's roll!

01:21:51.294 --> 01:21:53.360
Did you see the size
of that thing?

01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:29.388
Daddy! Daddy! Lookit!
It's the Rapid Rocket!

01:22:31.592 --> 01:22:34.292
And a horsey!

01:23:25.301 --> 01:23:29.569
Aaah!

01:23:37.176 --> 01:23:39.310
Oh, shit!

01:23:46.283 --> 01:23:48.217
He'll never outrun that dog!

01:23:48.219 --> 01:23:51.619
Oh, yeah, he will! Let's ride!

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:47.330
Aaah!

01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:45.709
Oh, my God! It caved in on him!

01:25:45.711 --> 01:25:48.578
He's six feet down at least!
He's gonna suffocate!

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.848
The tunnel collapsed!
He's at the bottom!

01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:55.383
More like seven feet down!

01:25:55.385 --> 01:25:58.252
Keep digging! Dig!
I don't see him!

01:26:12.632 --> 01:26:16.566
Oh, my God.
He doesn't look like he's breathing.

01:26:16.568 --> 01:26:20.603
Doesn't look too good.
Is he gonna be all right?

01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:33.313
Whoa.

01:26:45.558 --> 01:26:48.559
He's not so bad.

01:26:51.463 --> 01:26:54.530
Thanks, uh,

01:26:56.767 --> 01:26:59.599
Goliath. He's not so bad.

01:26:59.601 --> 01:27:01.535
Like the story. Yeah.

01:27:01.537 --> 01:27:04.436
Of course. Of course. Oh, yeah.

01:27:15.381 --> 01:27:17.948
Hello? Hello, sir.

01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:20.716
We, um, brought your dog back.

01:27:20.718 --> 01:27:24.319
Goliath?

01:27:24.555 --> 01:27:27.855
How'd he get out?
Well, sir, it was my fault.

01:27:27.857 --> 01:27:30.291
We kind of lost something
in your backyard,

01:27:30.293 --> 01:27:33.693
and we tried to
get it back, and...

01:27:33.695 --> 01:27:35.728
we knocked your wall down.

01:27:35.730 --> 01:27:38.497
You're joking? No, sir.

01:27:38.499 --> 01:27:42.533
Ten years ago...
Summer of '62, I believe...

01:27:42.535 --> 01:27:45.536
A bunch of kids lost a
baseball in my backyard.

01:27:45.538 --> 01:27:48.538
They tried everything to get
it back... all crazy stuff...

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:49.973
Because that ball was priceless.

01:27:49.975 --> 01:27:52.241
They made a mess of my yard,
knocked down my fence,

01:27:52.243 --> 01:27:56.711
and all they had to do was come knock on the
door, and I would have gotten it for them.

01:27:56.713 --> 01:28:01.416
Great, Smalls! You almost got me killed!
Way to go, Smalls.

01:28:01.418 --> 01:28:03.317
Good job, Smalls.

01:28:03.319 --> 01:28:05.219
But they were scared...

01:28:05.221 --> 01:28:06.786
because of some crazy
neighborhood story...

01:28:06.788 --> 01:28:12.224
about me being a mean old man
that raised up dogs to eat kids.

01:28:12.226 --> 01:28:14.793
You believe that nonsense?

01:28:16.829 --> 01:28:18.395
So,

01:28:18.397 --> 01:28:19.763
what did you lose back here?

01:28:19.765 --> 01:28:25.934
Well, um, just the future of
the United States space program.

01:28:25.936 --> 01:28:28.237
Oooh!

01:28:28.239 --> 01:28:28.837
That's somethin'.

01:28:28.839 --> 01:28:33.674
Why didn't you just come knock on the door?
I would have gotten it for you.

01:28:33.676 --> 01:28:34.809
Well, sir, uh...

01:28:34.811 --> 01:28:39.512
Yeah. That story about me's
still hanging around, isn't it?

01:28:39.514 --> 01:28:44.516
Kind of. Well, what are
we gonna do about that?

01:28:44.518 --> 01:28:49.254
So, you knocked over
my sculpture, huh?

01:28:49.256 --> 01:28:50.721
Sculpture?

01:28:50.723 --> 01:28:55.958
My wall. Took me three years
to build that work of art.

01:28:57.762 --> 01:29:00.862
Yes, sir. But we'll fix it.
We promise.

01:29:00.864 --> 01:29:03.998
You will, will ya? Yes, sir.

01:29:05.767 --> 01:29:07.800
Oh, no! He's getting away again!

01:29:07.802 --> 01:29:11.303
Leave him be. He's probably
going for a visit.

01:29:11.305 --> 01:29:14.972
You kids all live round here?
Yes, sir.

01:29:14.974 --> 01:29:17.441
I tell you what.

01:29:17.443 --> 01:29:20.744
I'll have all this junk
cleaned out of here...

01:29:20.746 --> 01:29:22.445
if you come round...

01:29:22.447 --> 01:29:25.848
and give Goliath
a walk twice a week.

01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:29.284
I don't do that anymore,
and he doesn't get out much.

01:29:29.286 --> 01:29:33.587
I wouldn't want him to turn
mean or anything, you know.

01:29:33.589 --> 01:29:35.389
Yes, sir.
We'll walk him for you.

01:29:35.391 --> 01:29:39.625
And you gotta play baseball all summer
long so I can listen to the games.

01:29:39.627 --> 01:29:44.896
It's been 10 years since there was a real
good bunch of players on the sandlot.

01:29:44.898 --> 01:29:46.831
And I miss 'em.

01:29:46.833 --> 01:29:49.633
And, uh, no more fences.

01:29:49.635 --> 01:29:53.303
I'm tired of kids
thinking I'm grouchy.

01:29:59.476 --> 01:30:00.942
Deal.

01:30:00.944 --> 01:30:04.445
Where'd he go?
You better find him, Johnnie.

01:30:04.447 --> 01:30:06.047
I'm not chasing that dog
all over town.

01:30:06.049 --> 01:30:09.649
He's not running away.
What's he sittin' there for?

01:30:09.651 --> 01:30:12.751
What's he doin'? We knew it.

01:30:13.788 --> 01:30:16.988
I don't get it.
What are they doing?

01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:19.724
Boys. I swear.

01:30:19.726 --> 01:30:21.892
He's in love.

01:30:26.431 --> 01:30:27.630
That's his girlfriend dog.

01:30:27.632 --> 01:30:31.599
That's why he's always wanted to get out.
To visit her.

01:30:31.601 --> 01:30:33.902
Oh, yeah. We knew that.

01:30:33.904 --> 01:30:35.603
Yeah, of course. We knew.

01:30:35.605 --> 01:30:39.673
Hey, is anybody hungry?
Let's go get some pizza.

01:30:39.675 --> 01:30:42.542
Well...

01:30:46.747 --> 01:30:50.715
Thanks. Um, you're welcome.

01:30:50.717 --> 01:30:54.018
Oh, so you can talk.

01:30:54.887 --> 01:30:58.021
Um, yeah.

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:17.535
So that was the summer that David
taught me the greatest lesson in life:

01:31:17.537 --> 01:31:21.772
that love conquers all...
Even your greatest fear.

01:31:21.774 --> 01:31:24.707
Mr. Goodfairer never found out
I launched his rocket.

01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:29.678
But it didn't matter because his
blueprints were America's future in space,

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:32.614
not the model of the shuttle.

01:31:32.616 --> 01:31:34.915
Goliath and Tiny had
five puppies.

01:31:34.917 --> 01:31:38.452
Hayley, Jenny and Penny
each got one for their own.

01:31:38.454 --> 01:31:41.421
Mr. Mertle kept two of them.

01:31:41.690 --> 01:31:45.491
The Retriever made peace with his inner
demons. His family moved to Australia,

01:31:45.493 --> 01:31:50.795
and he grew up to be the host of a
popular Animal Planet television show.

01:31:50.797 --> 01:31:51.562
Hey.

01:31:51.564 --> 01:31:54.431
You wouldn't know anything about
a kid in this neighborhood,

01:31:54.433 --> 01:31:57.067
goes around stealing
dog tags, would you?

01:31:57.069 --> 01:31:58.134
No, sir.

01:31:58.136 --> 01:32:01.704
Oh, I think I hear
my mom calling me.

01:32:01.706 --> 01:32:05.407
Yeah.

01:32:16.518 --> 01:32:21.019
I kept in touch with most everyone
over the years, and I found out...

01:32:21.021 --> 01:32:22.887
that Mac joined the army
after high school.

01:32:22.889 --> 01:32:27.991
He got wounded in the Gulf War, won a
Purple Heart and joined the Peace Corps.

01:32:27.993 --> 01:32:30.794
Fingers and his brother Saul
started a record label...

01:32:30.796 --> 01:32:33.796
for a new kind of music
called hip-hop.

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:37.432
They named their company
Deaf Jam Records.

01:32:37.434 --> 01:32:40.067
Penny and Jenny never did
anything more remarkable...

01:32:40.069 --> 01:32:41.535
than the most difficult thing
on earth.

01:32:41.537 --> 01:32:48.007
They both raised three kids and lived
happily ever after with their families.

01:32:48.009 --> 01:32:50.075
With the fortune he made
in the music business,

01:32:50.077 --> 01:32:53.445
Fingers started the most
successful gum company on earth.

01:32:53.447 --> 01:32:57.047
You know it as
Kissing Booth Bubble Gum.

01:33:00.785 --> 01:33:02.218
Tarqell... Well...

01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:06.887
Tarqell was abducted by aliens
on March 21, 1986,

01:33:06.889 --> 01:33:09.824
and no one ever saw him again.

01:33:12.627 --> 01:33:13.893
Hayley became a supermodel...

01:33:13.895 --> 01:33:17.563
and a pitcher for the United
States Olympic softball team.

01:33:17.565 --> 01:33:20.097
She won two gold medals.

01:33:28.507 --> 01:33:31.474
After David defeated Goliath,
he got a nickname.

01:33:31.476 --> 01:33:34.976
From then on he was known
as David "Rocket" Durango.

01:33:34.978 --> 01:33:38.146
Hayley and David went all the way
through high school together.

01:33:38.148 --> 01:33:40.481
After that,
they went their separate ways.

01:33:40.483 --> 01:33:42.249
Ten years after college,
they met again.

01:33:42.251 --> 01:33:44.617
At that meeting,
just like the first time...

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:47.820
he had ever had a chance
to talk to her in grade school,

01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:50.489
David was so nervous
he couldn't speak.

01:33:50.491 --> 01:33:52.724
So she spoke for him,
and she said,

01:33:52.726 --> 01:33:57.661
"You're supposed to say,
'Will you marry me?'"

01:33:57.663 --> 01:34:00.029
And he did.

01:34:02.868 --> 01:34:05.834
Oh, I almost forgot.
I grew up and went to work...

01:34:05.836 --> 01:34:08.070
for the Jet Propulsion
Laboratories.

01:34:08.072 --> 01:34:12.039
Hey. Rockets are still my life.
