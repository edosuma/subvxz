I remember you telling me you were
still feeding your friend's birds.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.199
Someone has to.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.119
Why are you here?

12:23.327 --> 12:25.621
- Have you seen the news?
- Walking zombies in Gotham?

12:26.497 --> 12:27.665
What's new?

12:27.832 --> 12:30.501
Strange worked for my father
on a project designed to help people.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.336
He perverted it
and now I believe he's found a way to--

12:32.503 --> 12:33.712
Bring back the dead?

12:34.171 --> 12:36.549
- A little far-fetched, don't you think?
- Perhaps.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.635
But he's hiding something.
The police have failed to find out what.

12:40.636 --> 12:41.846
I think I can do better.

12:42.638 --> 12:43.681
That so?

12:46.016 --> 12:48.644
When my father shut down Strange,
he was killed.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.023
Selina, I just want the truth, that's all.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.901
You just won't be happy
until you get yourself killed, will you?

12:56.068 --> 12:58.696
Victor Fries and Theo Galavan
both went to Arkham as dead men.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.030
Both returned.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.533
- I don't care.
- So did your friend Bridgit.

13:06.287 --> 13:08.038
Wait, they sent her to Arkham?

13:12.710 --> 13:14.170
She may still be there right now.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.422
<i>- Alive.</i>

13:23.053 --> 13:24.638
<i>To run, but she didn't listen.</i>

13:27.183 --> 13:28.559
It's my fault she's there.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.812
Selina, we can put this right.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.232
Strange was ready for the police.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.234
He may even have been tipped off.

13:37.401 --> 13:40.154
The only way we're gonna find out
what's really going on in there,

13:41.155 --> 13:42.490
is if we break in ourselves.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.658
Break in?

13:45.701 --> 13:46.785
To Arkham?

13:47.870 --> 13:50.331
A highly guarded place
that's packed with crazy people?

13:52.166 --> 13:54.210
If that's too dangerous for you,
I'll just go myself.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.422
I didn't say that.

14:00.424 --> 14:03.511
Prisons are meant to stop people
from breaking out, not in. It can be done.

14:03.928 --> 14:05.304
It's a looney bin.

14:05.763 --> 14:06.805
Not a prison.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.599
I know it can be done.

14:09.934 --> 14:11.352
But I go alone.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.695

14:21.862 --> 14:23.322

14:25.115 --> 14:27.159
And then you'll never find out
what they've been up to.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.038
That, or they'll just kill you.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.458
Besides,

14:35.584 --> 14:37.294

14:58.566 --> 15:00.401
