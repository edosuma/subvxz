00:01.589 --> 00:03.590
Previously on Stargate Atlantis

00:04.050 --> 00:05.290
You have some wraith DNA.

00:05.330 --> 00:07.930
- You can actually see what's happening?
- I'm on a ship.

00:08.570 --> 00:09.530
Receiving an IDC.

00:09.570 --> 00:11.370
- Who is it?
- Stargate Command.

00:11.410 --> 00:14.010
All we have to do is hold down
until the Daedalus get's here

00:14.050 --> 00:16.650
then we could use the ZPM to power the city shield.

00:16.890 --> 00:19.570
Multiple signals Sir. We couldn't see
them until they were right on top of us.

00:22.450 --> 00:24.770
The colonel Marshall Sumner
was a very good friend of mine

00:24.810 --> 00:27.450
You admit to firing the shot that killed him.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.930
The Wraith... they are in Atlantis.

00:30.090 --> 00:31.810
They're sending in another wave.

00:31.850 --> 00:34.130
Fly the puddle jumper in stealth
mode right down their throats.

00:34.170 --> 00:35.890
You are volunteering for a suicide mission?

00:35.930 --> 00:38.250
- You can't.
- I have to, and you know it.

00:45.330 --> 00:48.250
Teyla I'm hearing gun fire,
what's your status,

00:48.450 --> 00:49.130
<i>Teyla?</i>

00:54.810 --> 00:58.070
Mecanism armed and ready. I'm going in.

00:59.530 --> 01:00.690
And now the conclusion.

01:02.170 --> 01:03.410
Defense!

01:54.730 --> 01:56.610
Major Sheppard, decloak your jumper immediately.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.370
What? Who the hell is this?

01:59.410 --> 02:02.810
Authentication, Alpha Charlie 1. Decloak now!

02:07.130 --> 02:11.770
Detonation in 5, 4, 3, 2...

02:26.250 --> 02:28.190
Target has been neutralised.

02:30.570 --> 02:31.570
He did it.

02:33.050 --> 02:35.610
Yeah he did.

02:37.890 --> 02:39.530
Dr Weir I'm picking up another ship.

02:39.570 --> 02:43.130
- Another hive ship?
- Negative. I'm reading an IFF.

02:43.370 --> 02:45.290
<i>Atlantis? This is Sheppard.</i>

02:47.250 --> 02:48.210
John?

02:48.250 --> 02:49.570
<i>What other Sheppards do you know?</i>

02:49.970 --> 02:51.170
Oh thank God!

02:51.210 --> 02:52.850
No, that can't be. We saw the hive ship go up.

02:53.610 --> 02:56.050
<i>I assure you Dr McKay that
Major Sheppard is alive and well.</i>

02:56.490 --> 02:57.330
Who is this?

02:57.370 --> 03:02.770
Colonel Steven Caldwell. Commander of the Daedalus.
We are ready to assist you.

03:03.810 --> 03:05.730
Oh thank you!

03:06.130 --> 03:08.090
We are very glad to hear it, Colonel.

03:09.970 --> 03:13.090
And I assume we have you to
thank for saving Major Sheppard.

03:13.130 --> 03:15.930
We were monitoring your transmissions
as soon as we came out of hyperspace.

03:15.970 --> 03:17.890
We couldn't beam him in until he decloaked his jumper.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.490
Didn't take much convincing.

03:19.930 --> 03:20.730
Dr McKay?

03:21.610 --> 03:22.410
Present! Yes!

03:22.450 --> 03:24.730
<i>I trust you know what to do with this?</i>

03:27.610 --> 03:28.770
Your ZPM sir.

03:32.850 --> 03:34.050
How did they do that?

03:34.170 --> 03:38.570
The Daedalus is loaded with Asgard technology.
Beaming technology is the first part of it.

03:38.650 --> 03:43.170
- They got things like...
- Rodney? What say we get the shields back up.

03:45.730 --> 03:46.730
What say we.

03:48.650 --> 03:50.570
We still have Wraith all over the city

03:50.610 --> 03:53.250
After we deal with those other hive ships,
we'll assist you as soon as we can.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.330
Caldwell out.

03:54.450 --> 03:57.490
Sir, we have incoming enemy fighters bearing 320.

03:59.010 --> 04:02.090
All forward rail guns, stand by. Launch all fighters.

Season 2 - Episode 1
The Siege part III

05:33.840 --> 05:37.360
<i>Colonel Caldwell? This is Novak in engineering.</i>

05:37.400 --> 05:38.020
<i>What is it?</i>

05:38.060 --> 05:41.800
Hermiod wanted to remind you that our
shields strength will be severely diminished

05:41.840 --> 05:44.240
without the Zero Point Module
tied into our power systems.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.660
I'm well aware of that Doctor. Caldwell out.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.640
Major, do you recommend any
specific target on the hive ship?

05:51.680 --> 05:52.720
One of the fighter bays, Sir.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.840
That would increase the chance
of secondary explosions.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.200
That's what I was thinking, Sir.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.800
I agree. Waeps, arm two mark 8 tacticals.
Our target is the hive ships main fighter bay.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.080
Warheads armed. Target is locked Sir.

06:02.120 --> 06:02.680
Fire!

06:10.160 --> 06:11.520
We need to get in closer.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.240
Helm, alter heading to intercept. Go to max thrust.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.280
Max thrust.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.320
We'll just have to get closer.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.680
The Asgard gave you hyperdrives and shields.
How come, no offensive weapons?

06:20.720 --> 06:23.560
Providing other races with anything that
could be potentially used against them?

06:23.600 --> 06:24.720
I thought they were allies?

06:25.520 --> 06:28.040
Without their beaming technology,
you wouldn't be here, Major.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.120
Arm two more mark 8's.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.520
You're wasting ordinance, Colonel.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.880
Those missiles are being intercepted
miles from the hive ship.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.080
I've routed the shield's sub routine.
When I give the word, all you have to do is punch it...

06:43.120 --> 06:44.120
I know what to do, go!

06:48.720 --> 06:51.480
Whoa,whoa,whoa, what is this?
This is my security escort?

06:51.520 --> 06:53.480
Well we are spread a little bit thin right now.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.120
OK, but you need to know that if we come under fire,

06:55.160 --> 06:56.960
you're gonna have to put your
lives on the line to protect me.

06:57.000 --> 06:57.680
Rodney!

06:57.760 --> 07:00.280
OK,I mean the ZPM.
Protect the ZPM at all costs.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.000
And me! Am I wrong?

07:07.920 --> 07:09.440
- Dr Weir?
- Yes?

07:09.560 --> 07:11.560
I've lost contact with some of our people.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.720
Who?

07:12.760 --> 07:17.600
We can get a hold of the teams
led by Captain Radnor, Teyla or Lt Ford.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.320
Well keep trying.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.680
Now we're 0 for 2. How many things have you got?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.120
Only one needs to get through.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.800
Is there any way we can deliver a warhead
the same way you plucked me out of the Jumper?

07:39.840 --> 07:41.200
The Asgard have already considered that Major.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.280
There are failsafes built into the systems to prevent
their use as a weapons delivery system.

07:44.320 --> 07:48.840
You've got one of these Asgard onboard?
Can he override the failsafe?

07:48.880 --> 07:49.920
Why would he do that?

07:49.960 --> 07:52.280
Well, his butt's on the line, just as much as ours.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.520
Novak, I need you and Hermiod to figure out
how to get sight to sight transport

07:57.560 --> 07:59.520
locks on a set of coordinates inside the hive ship.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.360
No, no. Sir.
Hermiod isn't going to like that.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.840
<i>Get it done Doctor, that's an order.</i>

08:16.720 --> 08:17.480
That's where we have to go.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.760
What was that? I didn't get all that.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.919
What do I do? Look, I'm gonna get to
the rolling things. Maybe I can uh...

09:16.160 --> 09:16.920
Clear.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.320
No, no. You stay here.

09:27.120 --> 09:31.600
So! This is how it's gonna be?
Just me?

09:33.600 --> 09:35.720
OK, that's fine!

09:35.760 --> 09:38.640
You want some of this?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.640
This is McKay! I'm in trouble down here!

09:49.600 --> 09:51.200
Dr McKay? Are you alright?

09:51.240 --> 09:52.800
Teyla, we thought you were...

09:52.840 --> 09:56.480
My radio was broken and I was separated from my group.
I've been trying to make my way back.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.800
Oh thank God! You have no idea.
I thought I was gonna...

09:58.840 --> 10:00.080
I thought you were very brave.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.160
Really?

10:02.400 --> 10:04.840
- I have a ZPM.
- Yes.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.120
We need to get the shields up.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.440
- Lead the way.
- Yeah sure. After you.

10:13.760 --> 10:17.520
I've set the timer for 5 seconds.
Is that enough time for you?

10:17.560 --> 10:19.920
Five seconds should be more than ample.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.200
OK look. I know you don't approve of using
techology this way, but you have to understand...

10:26.240 --> 10:27.760
I am ready.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.880
Colonel, Hermiod is ready and
standing by for warhead transport,

10:33.920 --> 10:37.680
but I can tell you, he is not happy about this.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.480
I take that under advisement.
Are we within transport range?

10:41.520 --> 10:42.280
Yes Sir!

10:43.680 --> 10:45.080
Transport warhead when ready.

10:45.760 --> 10:50.400
Ready! 5... The weapon is away.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.400
We have a kill.
The last hive ship has been neutralised.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.480
Novak, I need you to prep
another warhead for transport.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.800
We need to take out those cruisers.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.880
Sir wait!

11:14.800 --> 11:17.760
Colonel, cruisers have broken off
and entered hyperspace.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.240
Seeing what we just did to
their remaining hive ships, I don't blame them.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.800
There are still a lot of Darts out there.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.000
Alright, let's clean this up.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.640
Sir, the Wraith fighters are regrouping.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.360
Everyone get into position.
Stand by for defensive fire.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.480
We're not the target.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.360
Major Sheppard is right, Sir.
The formation is headed toward Atlantis.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.560
Elizabeth, you've got a problem.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.240
Yeah, we see that Major.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.000
<i>We're moving to intercept,
but I don't think we can get there in time.</i>

11:42.080 --> 11:43.720
Not a chance. They're coming in too fast.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.440
Oh my God! Their approach is ballistic.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.640
And what exactly does that mean?

11:47.680 --> 11:51.240
Their impact velocities will be in excess
of 10,000 kilometres an hour.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.800
No part of the city can withstand that.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.480
You'd better get the damn shield up!

11:55.520 --> 11:57.120
How much time do we have?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.080
45 seconds.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.440
Rodney we need the shield up
in 40 seconds or we're dead!

12:03.480 --> 12:04.320
Are you kidding me?

12:04.360 --> 12:05.000
No!

12:05.040 --> 12:08.160
<i>I think we're nearing the point
in which I completely snap.</i>

12:08.200 --> 12:09.280
Rodney!

12:11.360 --> 12:14.080
That should do it! Fire it up!

12:18.760 --> 12:20.160
That didn't do it.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.480
- What?
- It is not working.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.520
- I know what she said!
- 20 seconds.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.800
Okay, Snap! That's it!
Are you all happy now?

12:26.880 --> 12:31.920
- Rodney!
- OK, OK, OK! Try it now!

12:50.200 --> 12:52.800
Atlantis? This is Sheppard. Come in.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.880
Atlantis?

13:05.160 --> 13:07.120
<i>This is Sheppard. What is your status?</i>

13:07.160 --> 13:09.120
The explosions must have disrupted the radio signal.

13:09.240 --> 13:13.000
We're still here. That's our status.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.560
Don't scare me like that.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.160
<i>Sorry. What about the Wraith fleet?</i>

13:19.240 --> 13:21.280
The remaining cruisers have withdrawn from battle.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.840
Thank you Colonel. Thank all of you.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.880
Glad to be of help. We're gonna stay in
Geosynchronous orbit for the time being.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.440
Can we be of any further assistance?

13:30.480 --> 13:32.480
We could use some help with the Wraith in the city.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.280
We're sending some people to help with that.
Daedalus out.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.360
Major Sheppard. I'm sure you're
anxious to get back to Atlantis.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.560
Yes Sir! Thank you.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.080
<i>Rodney? You can take the rest of the day off.</i>

13:53.400 --> 13:58.040
I'm going to curl up in bed with
the largest sandwich I can find.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.560
Shall I just explain to the rest of the Wraith left
on the base, that you're unavailable to fight?

14:05.680 --> 14:06.720
Right.

14:23.600 --> 14:27.960
Secure Stargate Operations. Hello, I'm home!

14:41.440 --> 14:42.800
Yes you are.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.760
I truly thought...

14:46.800 --> 14:49.480
Yeah, yeah. I thought the same
thing about you, a minute ago.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.600
We gotta stop that.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.120
I'd like that.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.080
So uh, where are we?

14:58.880 --> 15:00.760
Well most of our sensors are still down,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.960
but we do know that there are at least
a handful of Wraith still in the city.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.160
Still got some work to do.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.560
Before you do anything,
Colonel Everett insists on speaking with you.

15:09.480 --> 15:10.960
He's in the infirmary.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.880
We've neutralised the hive ships,
activated the shields

15:23.280 --> 15:27.800
and we've mustered as many people as we can,
making sure there are no Wraith hiding in the shadows.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.440
- Good work Major.
- Thank you, Sir.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.400
They're shipping me out
with the next batch of wounded.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.400
I wanted to finish our conversation.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.840
Yes Sir.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.800
I owe you an apology.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.880
No Sir, you don't.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.120
I think I have a pretty good idea.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.680
I would have done the same thing as you did,
when you found Colonel Sumner.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.160
That's what I wanted to tell you.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.000
None of that matters right now, Sir.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.040
I'm trying to say,

16:13.560 --> 16:16.240
I wish you had been there for me.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.200
- You're gonna be fine Sir, once you get back to Earth.
- I said what I had to say.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.520
Get back to work.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.840
Yes Sir.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.120
Preliminary count is 40 casualties.

16:51.680 --> 16:55.240
Maybe more. I'm still trying to line up
life signs readings with actual people.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.920
There are no Wraith life signs?

16:57.120 --> 17:00.040
The last one was trapped in one
of the deeper parts of the city.

17:00.840 --> 17:03.960
He died trying to damage city
with one of their grenades.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.520
Three of our men were injured.
On the bright side, there was no flooding.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.640
Have we been able to locate Lt Ford?

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
I'm sorry, no.

17:12.520 --> 17:17.119
We searched everywhere in the city. It's possible
he may have beamed up into one of the Wraith Darts.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.680
Let's not make that assumption.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.119
Major, I'm sorry.
We searched everywhere inside the city.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.800
Well how about outside the city?

17:23.079 --> 17:26.040
- I don't understand.
- Expand the sensors. Maybe he's in the water.

17:26.359 --> 17:27.760
Even if that was the case, there's no chance...

17:27.880 --> 17:31.080
Look, I'm not asking you to swim out there,
I'm asking you to press a few damn buttons!

17:32.360 --> 17:34.160
Even if you're right, I don't see how...

17:37.520 --> 17:39.400
Oh my God.

17:48.880 --> 17:53.280
Colonel Caldwell? One of our men is
in the ocean outside our shield.
Most probably injured.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.680
Can you beam him to your ship
and down to our infirmary?

18:02.240 --> 18:05.000
Atlantis? This is Dr Novak on the Daedalus.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.680
<i>You're gonna need some SO's in your infirmary,
before we beam your man down.</i>

18:08.040 --> 18:09.760
We already do Doctor. Beam away.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.240
Good Lord!

18:18.280 --> 18:19.640
Let's get this thing off of him.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.280
<i>How is he?</i>

18:27.800 --> 18:31.440
<i>I gave him a mild sedative to help rest,
but he should be dead.</i>

18:32.160 --> 18:33.560
<i>He's a tough kid.</i>

18:33.600 --> 18:37.600
Not my point, Major. He was lying face
down in the freezing water for over an hour.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.560
I don't care how tough he is.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.720
So what are you saying?

18:40.960 --> 18:42.320
We still have no idea how it works,

18:42.360 --> 18:46.080
but during the Wraith feeding process,
the victim is injected with a special enzyme.

18:46.120 --> 18:50.200
It strengthens the human body temporarily
and ensures that the heart continues to beat.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.520
Why would they wanna make you stronger?

18:52.560 --> 18:54.160
So the victim doesn't die immediately.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.200
The feeding process is so traumatic,
that without the special enzyme,

18:57.440 --> 18:59.280
we shut down far sooner than they like.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.720
They make you stronger
so they can take more time to kill you.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.200
Lovely, isn't it?

19:04.800 --> 19:09.040
In most cases the enzyme is released slowly
into the blood stream throughout the feeding process.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.640
I can only ascertain that
the Wraith died quite suddenly

19:13.120 --> 19:15.320
and that Lt Ford's system became flooded with it.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.120
And that's why he was able
to survive in the water for so long.

19:18.160 --> 19:18.880
Exactly.

19:19.280 --> 19:23.200
The problem is, now the enzyme is breaking
down in his system, eventually there'll be none left.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.760
That's not good.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.680
No. In fact, I'm quite certain it'll kill him.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.320
<i>It's possible his body's become
dependant on the enzyme to function.</i>

19:31.360 --> 19:32.400
What's the treatment?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.560
We wean him off it. Sneak his body
chemistry back to normal incrementally.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.640
Then we're gonna have to get more of this enzyme.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.720
Aye. With your permission Doctor,

19:40.920 --> 19:43.840
I'd like to harvest it from the Wraith bodies
in the morgue. I know it's a little bit creepy, but...

19:44.200 --> 19:45.640
<i>Elizabeth. Major Sheppard?</i>

19:46.600 --> 19:47.920
Do whatever you have to do.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.400
- What is it?
- You're gonna wanna get up here.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.280
Aren't you supposed to be getting some sleep, Rodney?

20:06.480 --> 20:09.680
I was trying to do just that, but someone thought I should
know the deep space sensors were back up and running.

20:09.920 --> 20:10.760
Yes, and?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.960
They picked up 12 more hive ships
travelling in hyperspace.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.120
Their course and speed will
bring them here in 36 hours.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.000
12 hive ships?

20:38.010 --> 20:40.650
The Cruisers that got away
probably called for reinforcements.

20:41.130 --> 20:44.770
Our research shows there are
at least 60 hive ships in this galaxy.

20:45.050 --> 20:46.450
But who knows how many more could be on the way?

20:47.050 --> 20:49.530
- At least the shield's up and running.
- That only buys us time!

20:49.650 --> 20:50.450
I like time.

20:50.570 --> 20:53.690
Look, the first siege of Atlantis lasted for years.
I mean,

20:53.890 --> 20:56.830
with only one functioning ZPM,
we can't expect to hold on that long.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.730
Can we submerge the city again?

20:59.730 --> 21:01.810
It's a city, not a yo-yo.

21:02.050 --> 21:03.570
Look, I don't even know
how they did it the first time.

21:04.170 --> 21:05.410
How long until they arrive?

21:06.210 --> 21:07.450
A little over a day.

21:08.450 --> 21:09.650
You know what?

21:10.890 --> 21:12.050
I'm sick of this.

21:12.810 --> 21:13.570
I'm sorry?

21:13.970 --> 21:17.370
I mean, sitting around waiting for them to show up.
I say we take the fight to them.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.170
We've got one ship, Major.

21:19.210 --> 21:23.250
We got one ship with an Asgard shield,
an armoury full of nukes and beaming technology.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.090
- That evens the odds out a lot.
- Twelve ships and their escorts.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.930
I'm telling you.
We've gotta send these guys a message.

21:29.530 --> 21:31.570
We're not like the Ancients.
We're not gonna sit around and wait.

21:32.210 --> 21:33.010
If they don't back off,

21:33.130 --> 21:36.570
we have the capacity and the will
to go kick their asses for a change.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.730
How do I fight a ship in hyperspace?

21:39.490 --> 21:43.130
The Wraith's faster than light travel is not
as the Asgard hyperdrive aboard the Daedalus.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.090
Not only slower,
they need to travel in a series of jumps.

21:48.410 --> 21:50.330
So if my calculations are correct,

21:51.330 --> 21:55.450
they'll make one last stop here, fifty light years away,
before they make the final jump to Atlantis.

21:56.850 --> 21:57.930
Dr Weir?

21:59.570 --> 22:02.530
It will feel good to have them
on the defensive for a change.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.690
Alright then,

22:06.530 --> 22:08.170
let's do this.

22:19.450 --> 22:21.770
Scanners are clear, Sir. No contacts.

22:21.810 --> 22:22.970
I hope we're in the right spot.

22:23.330 --> 22:26.450
They'll be here.
I'm willing to trust Rodney about these things.

22:28.970 --> 22:32.770
I've set the warheads to go off
one second after reintegration.

22:34.210 --> 22:37.130
So I assume you're fine with that?

22:42.610 --> 22:43.730
OK...

22:46.970 --> 22:49.250
They are angry. I can feel it.

22:49.690 --> 22:53.090
Word of our success might spread to other worlds.
They want us silenced.

22:53.690 --> 22:55.130
You can sense that?

22:55.690 --> 22:58.330
The Wraith warrior were in such close proximity...

22:59.610 --> 23:01.210
Excuse me.

23:01.570 --> 23:02.250
Ford!

23:02.490 --> 23:04.010
I'd like to report for duty ma'am.

23:05.410 --> 23:07.250
Dr. Beckett released you?

23:08.170 --> 23:09.850
Why wouldn't he, I'm fine.

23:13.970 --> 23:17.970
If we can hit the first one or two as soon as
they exit hyperspace, I think that'll send a message.

23:18.210 --> 23:19.490
Who knows, maybe they'll surrender.

23:19.650 --> 23:20.650
Sir, we have a contact.

23:20.850 --> 23:23.170
Stand by for weapons deployment.
Shields at max power.

23:23.330 --> 23:23.850
Shields up.

23:29.770 --> 23:32.130
Novak, this is Caldwell.
Begin deployment at your discretion.

23:32.610 --> 23:36.170
I have a weapons lock on the
coordinates of the first enemy vessel.

23:36.610 --> 23:38.970
Got it! First weapon away, Colonel.

23:44.050 --> 23:45.250
That's a kill.

23:45.890 --> 23:47.010
<i>Stand by.</i>

23:52.770 --> 23:54.130
Alright, that's two.

23:55.050 --> 23:56.090
It's working.

23:56.410 --> 23:58.330
Stand by for coordinates.

23:58.650 --> 24:00.490
The other hive ships are altering course to intercept.

24:00.690 --> 24:01.770
- Take us right at them.
- Yes Sir.

24:08.010 --> 24:09.090
They're flanking us.

24:10.010 --> 24:11.090
Forward rail guns, return fire.

24:11.250 --> 24:14.130
Novak we need to speed up deployment of
those nukes or this fight is going to be over soon.

24:17.530 --> 24:22.010
The enemy has engaged counter measures
that are preventing our ability to transport.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.890
- Is there a way to counter the counter?
- None.

24:25.490 --> 24:29.570
<i>Colonel, we have a problem. They've found a way to jam
us from beaming onto their ship. We don't know how.</i>

24:31.050 --> 24:32.970
Rear shield emitters are down to forty percent!

24:36.450 --> 24:38.730
Central rail gun two is out of action!

24:38.770 --> 24:40.810
Take engines to max. Foster!

24:41.170 --> 24:42.970
Try keeping the damaged shield from the main force.

24:55.490 --> 24:58.250
Sir! One of the cruisers is approaching
on a parrallel course.

24:58.810 --> 25:02.290
They may intend to board us!
That was their strategy when they attacked Atlantis.

25:02.530 --> 25:03.410
Shield status?

25:03.850 --> 25:04.810
Under 20%.

25:05.010 --> 25:06.770
Set course for Atlantis. Engage hyperdrive.

25:07.010 --> 25:07.890
Hyperdrive. Yes Sir!

25:08.490 --> 25:09.530
This fight is over.

25:27.250 --> 25:28.890
<i>Bottom line is, it didn't work.</i>

25:29.290 --> 25:31.090
At least you gave them something to think about.

25:31.530 --> 25:35.570
We'll see. I doubt very much that that tactic won't
work again and the Daedalus has sustained damage.

25:36.370 --> 25:38.010
It was still the right thing to do.

25:39.490 --> 25:41.370
We should make it home before they do.

25:41.730 --> 25:44.090
<i>I hope so.
We'll keep the porch light on for you.</i>

25:45.610 --> 25:46.850
OK, what are our options?

25:47.050 --> 25:50.690
Well let me see, we've got slow death,
quick death, painful death, cold lonely death...

25:50.810 --> 25:55.370
OK, you said yourself that the shield
should buy us some time.

25:55.530 --> 25:56.370
Where do you want me?

25:56.810 --> 25:57.850
Lieutenant, I...

25:58.890 --> 26:00.930
Lt! What do you think you're doing here?

26:01.130 --> 26:03.130
- I'm fine Doc, really. It's cool.
- The hell you are. You should be back in bed.

26:03.690 --> 26:05.530
I feel great. Just drop it.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.410
I will not just drop it.
Not twenty minutes ago, you were at death's door.

26:08.770 --> 26:11.450
I don't care how spry you feel,
you need to be under medical supervision.

26:12.890 --> 26:14.370
I'm good to go.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.410
I appreciate your enthusiasm Lieutenant, but Doctor...

26:17.570 --> 26:20.930
I'm serious! Just let me prove it.
Just give me something to do.

26:21.090 --> 26:22.810
- I don't think so.
- Don't push me around!

26:25.410 --> 26:26.690
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

26:28.610 --> 26:31.450
Put him down Aiden, he's trying to help you.

26:35.370 --> 26:36.410
Aiden.

26:50.890 --> 26:52.170
I'm sorry Doc.

26:53.010 --> 26:55.530
- I don't know why I...
- You need to be under medical supervision.

26:56.810 --> 26:58.490
He's right, Lieutenant.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.930
We just wanna know why
you're suddenly feeling this way.

27:04.450 --> 27:05.050
OK,

27:05.730 --> 27:06.530
I'll go back.

27:07.130 --> 27:08.530
Good, that's what you should do.

27:11.730 --> 27:12.330
Yes ma'am.

27:21.530 --> 27:22.730
Sedate him if you have to.

27:23.130 --> 27:23.730
Aye.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.730
<i>It's starting to affect his brain chemistry.</i>

27:46.930 --> 27:48.450
<i>There's no way you could have known that Carson,</i>

27:48.490 --> 27:49.930
<i>and it's better this than death.</i>

27:50.130 --> 27:51.730
<i>We need to be more aggressive</i>

27:51.770 --> 27:53.630
<i>wean him off quicker than I expected to.</i>

27:53.930 --> 27:55.530
<i>It'll be painful and arduous,</i>

27:55.570 --> 27:57.130
<i>but I think it may be our only option.</i>

27:57.730 --> 27:58.830
Now I've sedated him,

27:58.930 --> 28:01.030
but he should definitely be under secure supervision.

28:01.130 --> 28:02.630
I've already stationed a guard at the door.

28:03.730 --> 28:04.430
<i>Doctor Weir,</i>

28:04.530 --> 28:07.530
<i>the Daedalus is requesting
permission to land on the east pier.</i>

28:08.530 --> 28:10.050
Permission granted. I'll meet them there.

28:29.130 --> 28:30.730
Welcome back to Atlantis, Colonel.

28:30.770 --> 28:31.930
The Wraith are right behind us.

28:32.130 --> 28:33.130
I wasn't expecting you to land.

28:33.170 --> 28:36.530
Until repairs are complete, the Daedalus is going
to need Atlantis' shields as much as you do.

28:37.130 --> 28:37.730
<i>Doctor Weir,</i>

28:37.850 --> 28:39.570
<i>the hive ships are emmerging from hyperspace.</i>

28:40.130 --> 28:40.930
We're on our way.

28:53.330 --> 28:55.330
- Ford!
- Don't move or I'll shoot!

28:57.730 --> 28:58.850
Where's the rest of the enzyme!

28:59.330 --> 28:59.930
There is no more.

28:59.970 --> 29:01.930
I saw you extract it, don't lie to me!
Where is it?

29:01.970 --> 29:02.530
No, I'm not lying!

29:06.250 --> 29:06.850
Where is it?

29:07.330 --> 29:08.730
You're not thinking straight son.

29:10.130 --> 29:10.930
You're all afraid of me.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.130
Look at what you're doing,
we have good reason to be.

29:13.530 --> 29:15.450
- I'm gonna die if I don't get it!
- Aiden, you're not gonna die.

29:15.490 --> 29:16.130
Shut up!

29:22.330 --> 29:23.530
I'm not gonna ask again.

29:43.530 --> 29:44.210
Is that all of it?

29:46.130 --> 29:48.130
- I promise you.
- Toss it over.

29:49.130 --> 29:49.830
Toss it!

29:56.610 --> 29:57.850
Don't follow me.

30:06.810 --> 30:09.130
They're getting into some sort of formation.

30:10.530 --> 30:11.130
Move, move!

30:30.730 --> 30:33.130
The shield's holding under bombardment,
but it's under incredible strain.

30:33.170 --> 30:34.330
How long will it hold?

30:34.370 --> 30:36.650
Well if they stop firing at it,
it'll last almost indefinitely,

30:36.690 --> 30:38.250
- but with this kind of...
- Are we talking months, weeks?

30:38.290 --> 30:38.810
Days.

30:39.930 --> 30:42.630
At this rate the ZPM will be depleted within days.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.530
It's almost pretty, isn't it?

30:52.930 --> 30:55.330
Almost. But not quite.

31:01.230 --> 31:03.750
We need to get the Daedalus back
into fighting form within 24 hours,

31:03.790 --> 31:05.630
but I think the next engagement
gonna have the same result.

31:07.150 --> 31:09.830
Even if we were able to destroy
these ships this instant,

31:10.110 --> 31:13.230
more would be here in a few days
and even more a few days after that.

31:13.270 --> 31:15.710
From where I'm standing
I just don't see how we can win this.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.430
Well now we know how the Ancients must have felt.

31:18.430 --> 31:19.830
Atlantis is the only way to Earth.

31:20.230 --> 31:21.830
As long as they know we're here,

31:22.110 --> 31:23.030
they're just going to keep coming.

31:24.030 --> 31:25.630
As long as they know that we're here.

31:26.550 --> 31:27.230
What do you mean?

31:28.030 --> 31:30.830
Zelenka just said that as long as they know
that we're here, they'll keep coming.

31:31.030 --> 31:32.030
Yes, he said that.

31:32.830 --> 31:33.950
Well what if they thought we were gone?

31:34.270 --> 31:36.630
Then there'd be no reason for them to stay.

31:36.750 --> 31:37.510
Exactly.

31:37.950 --> 31:38.830
Exactly what?

31:39.430 --> 31:40.350
We disappear.

31:43.310 --> 31:44.310
Destroy the city you mean?

31:44.430 --> 31:45.830
No, we just make it look like we did.

31:47.150 --> 31:47.670
How?

31:48.630 --> 31:49.310
We cloak it.

31:49.430 --> 31:51.150
Yes, yes!

31:51.190 --> 31:53.830
The Puddle Jumpers are equipped
with cloaking technology,

31:53.870 --> 31:57.110
which renders them invisible to the naked eye
and to Wraith scans.

31:57.150 --> 32:00.430
If we just simply remove one of the cloak generators
from the Puddle Jumper...

32:00.470 --> 32:01.710
I wouldn't say simply, but yes,

32:01.750 --> 32:03.830
by interfacing a Jumper's

32:03.870 --> 32:07.230
stealth mode generator with the city's shield,
we should be able to render the city invisible.

32:07.430 --> 32:08.230
That's all well and good,

32:08.270 --> 32:11.230
but I think if the city were to suddenly disappear,
they might be able to put one and one together.

32:11.270 --> 32:12.990
Which is why we fake a self destruct.

32:13.230 --> 32:16.350
Have the Daedalus beam a nuke right
above the city shield and then detonate it.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.830
While their sensors are blinded, we cloak the city.

32:20.030 --> 32:20.710
When the smoke clears...

32:20.830 --> 32:21.630
Nothing but ocean.

32:22.030 --> 32:23.110
What about high radiation?

32:23.390 --> 32:26.230
I should be able to calculate with reasonable accuracy,
how long to wait before we switch over to the cloak.

32:26.270 --> 32:27.830
But what about the displacement issues?

32:27.870 --> 32:29.230
It's called planet emulation.That's the easy part.

32:29.510 --> 32:31.550
OK. What about the hard part?

32:32.630 --> 32:33.310
Hard part?

32:33.630 --> 32:36.430
Ah! The cloak, for all intents and purposes,
will replace the shield,

32:36.470 --> 32:40.030
which means that we'll be
completely unprotected once the cloak's activated.

32:40.430 --> 32:41.630
We'll be completely exposed?

32:41.830 --> 32:43.830
Well... yes.

32:44.550 --> 32:45.950
So if they're not fooled by the ruse...

32:45.990 --> 32:50.030
Then they destroy the city, which I remind
you is exactly what we were going to do anyway.

32:51.630 --> 32:52.430
What about the Daedalus?

32:52.470 --> 32:53.430
Well if it doesn't work,

32:53.470 --> 32:56.270
our shields should be sufficiently recharged
to break through their lines and escape.

32:56.310 --> 32:57.230
We know we can outrun them.

32:57.470 --> 33:02.830
Alright. Let's get as many non essential personnel
onto your ship as we can. Just in case.

33:03.430 --> 33:05.230
I love this idea. I really do.

33:05.430 --> 33:09.230
But the Wraith are aware
that we have cloaking technology.

33:10.030 --> 33:10.630
<i>They are close.</i>

33:12.230 --> 33:14.030
Close enough for me to connect to them.

33:15.030 --> 33:19.150
If I can convince them that we intend
to destroy Atlantis rather than allow it to be taken,

33:19.190 --> 33:21.230
just before the explosion occurs.

33:21.430 --> 33:23.230
How will we know whether or not they believe you?

33:23.510 --> 33:25.630
Once they stop the bombardment, we'll know.

33:26.030 --> 33:26.630
He's right.

33:27.630 --> 33:30.670
If the Wraith believe that
we intend to destroy the city,

33:31.430 --> 33:33.830
the last thing they'll wanna do,
is to help us do it.

33:35.830 --> 33:36.830
How much time do you need?

33:37.110 --> 33:37.830
Oh uh...

33:37.870 --> 33:38.830
- Week.
- Couple of hours.

33:39.030 --> 33:40.830
I'll take the second estimate.
Go!

33:43.430 --> 33:44.230
You're in union?

33:44.310 --> 33:45.110
Couple of hours.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.230
He escaped.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.430
- What?
- Who?

33:54.150 --> 33:58.030
Ford. He was able to disarm one of the marines
and got away with all the Wraith enzyme I had left.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.630
Ford, this is Sheppard, come in.

34:00.830 --> 34:04.630
Ford? I need you to come back
to the control room buddy, we're all going home.

34:07.230 --> 34:08.630
<i>Lt do you copy?</i>

34:10.350 --> 34:11.630
You're just afraid of me Major.

34:12.429 --> 34:13.830
You're afraid of what I can do now.

34:15.510 --> 34:16.429
I'm not listening to you.

34:19.030 --> 34:20.030
I'm going after him.

34:21.429 --> 34:22.630
Now's not the right time!

35:01.150 --> 35:03.430
Now I'm jolting you out of this the second
I feel there's a problem.

35:04.230 --> 35:05.030
I understand.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.150
We're all set down here.

35:08.430 --> 35:10.430
Good! We're almost ready up here. Rodney?

35:10.470 --> 35:11.030
Ready!

35:11.070 --> 35:11.630
Radek!

35:14.230 --> 35:14.830
Ready to go.

35:17.030 --> 35:17.830
<i>Colonel Caldwell.</i>

35:18.230 --> 35:19.350
The people are securely aboard.

35:19.470 --> 35:21.830
The warhead has been armed
and is ready for deployment on your mark.

35:22.150 --> 35:23.430
<i>Very good! Stand by!</i>

35:42.830 --> 35:43.550
Dr Beckett?

35:46.030 --> 35:46.630
Teyla.

35:47.630 --> 35:48.630
I'm ready.

35:50.430 --> 35:51.230
We're good to go.

35:52.430 --> 35:53.870
Alright, let's send our message.

36:11.230 --> 36:12.430
I am on one of the ships.

36:15.630 --> 36:16.230
They see me.

36:24.190 --> 36:24.790
Teyla?

36:26.630 --> 36:27.830
The message has been delivered.

36:28.430 --> 36:29.230
Elizabeth, it's done.

36:39.950 --> 36:42.030
Seems that they heard Teyla loud and clear.
Rodney?

36:42.070 --> 36:43.630
- Yeah! I think I'm ready.
- You think?

36:44.630 --> 36:45.830
I am definitely ready.

36:47.630 --> 36:48.830
Daedalus, launch the weapon.

36:49.030 --> 36:50.030
Give me city wide.

36:50.830 --> 36:53.430
Attention all personnel.
Prepare for detonation flash.

36:54.030 --> 36:55.230
Shut 'em down!

37:03.830 --> 37:04.830
The weapon is away.

37:22.830 --> 37:23.750
Rodney?

37:23.950 --> 37:26.590
If we switch to cloak before the blast radius diminishes, we'll all be incinerated.

37:26.630 --> 37:27.230
Five seconds.

37:28.430 --> 37:30.830
Stand by to engage sublight engines on my mark.

37:30.870 --> 37:31.830
Standing by Sir.

37:38.630 --> 37:40.230
I think that was definitely five seconds.

37:41.230 --> 37:42.030
We're cloaked.

37:43.030 --> 37:43.710
How can you tell?

37:44.830 --> 37:45.750
They're scanning for us.

37:51.830 --> 37:53.830
I could have shot you a couple of times by now.

37:56.750 --> 37:59.430
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

38:02.430 --> 38:03.030
Look,

38:04.310 --> 38:08.030
why don't you and I just go someplace
where we can talk.

38:08.430 --> 38:09.630
You're trying to change me back.

38:09.830 --> 38:12.430
No, I'm just trying to help you.

38:19.630 --> 38:20.830
No you're not.

38:21.550 --> 38:22.230
Crap.

38:33.230 --> 38:34.350
I don't think they've detected us.

38:36.630 --> 38:37.630
Why are you whispering?

38:39.230 --> 38:40.430
I don't know, it just
seems like the right thing to do.

38:42.830 --> 38:43.830
Is it working or not?

38:55.150 --> 38:56.430
What the hell...?

39:03.830 --> 39:04.430
Where's Ford.

39:04.470 --> 39:06.430
I assume that's him in the Jumper?

39:10.150 --> 39:11.630
- Can they detect that?
- I don't know.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.430
Shut it down!

39:12.470 --> 39:14.030
I can't the Jumper's in control!

39:16.230 --> 39:19.830
Ford! Stand down, this is a direct order!

39:35.710 --> 39:36.830
Where the hell is he going?

39:38.830 --> 39:41.630
It won't matter if the Wraith can detect
the gate activity through the cloak.

39:42.430 --> 39:43.230
There's only one way to know.

39:50.430 --> 39:53.550
<i>This is Daedalus. Our sensors indicate
the Wraith fleet is breaking orbit.</i>

39:56.310 --> 39:57.230
I can confirm that.

39:57.750 --> 39:58.830
They're headed for hyperspace.

39:59.150 --> 40:01.790
Look, I'm gonna keep the cloak up
for a while just to be sure, but

40:02.630 --> 40:03.430
I think they bought it.

40:15.230 --> 40:17.630
The gate address will be in the log.
There's still a chance...

40:17.670 --> 40:18.430
Doesn't matter where he goes.

40:20.030 --> 40:21.390
The second he gets to wherever he's going,

40:22.230 --> 40:23.630
he's gonna ditch the Jumper,

40:24.150 --> 40:24.910
turn around,

40:25.830 --> 40:28.030
and dial another address. One we can't trace.

40:29.110 --> 40:29.910
We'll find him.

40:30.630 --> 40:31.230
Maybe.

40:36.430 --> 40:37.830
At least we're still around to try.

40:41.830 --> 40:42.230
Yeah.
