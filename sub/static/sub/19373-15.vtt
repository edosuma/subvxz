00:04.266 --> 00:06.531
(pups barking and laughing)

00:07.024 --> 00:09.923
Okay, pups, let's go and check
out the new Ferris Wheel.

00:09.954 --> 00:10.962
Rocky, dude!

00:11.001 --> 00:13.680
Let's try this when we go over
the tippy-top of the ride...

00:13.766 --> 00:16.493
- Whee!
- Yeah! Let's do it together!

00:16.769 --> 00:20.873
Ready? One, two, three...

00:21.030 --> 00:22.730
(All:)
Whee!

00:23.114 --> 00:24.344
(all laughing)

00:30.204 --> 00:33.392
Today, I am proud
to announce... oh, no, no.

00:33.470 --> 00:35.954
I need a better opening
for my speech.

00:35.979 --> 00:37.040
(clucking)

00:37.065 --> 00:41.601
"luck," that's it!
It's adventure bay's lucky day!

00:41.733 --> 00:45.218
We finally have
our very own Ferris Wheel.

00:45.710 --> 00:49.569
Thank you for
the inspiration, Chickaletta.

00:50.208 --> 00:54.356
No fair. I love Ferris Wheel's a
hundred-gazillion times more

00:54.403 --> 00:57.661
than Mayor Goodway.
It should be mine!

00:57.950 --> 01:00.505
Huh?
Hmm, I need a new pencil.

01:00.543 --> 01:01.743
(clucking)

01:02.895 --> 01:03.895
(chuckling)

01:04.007 --> 01:06.438
Now's our chance
to set up a distraction.

01:06.617 --> 01:09.356
Let's get that wheel, kitties!

01:11.213 --> 01:12.650
(meowing)

01:13.252 --> 01:14.557
(meowing)

01:15.203 --> 01:16.525
(meowing)

01:17.919 --> 01:19.705
(meowing)

01:19.838 --> 01:21.127
Now, what is this adorable,

01:21.221 --> 01:24.244
Yet strangely
suspicious kitten up to?

01:25.040 --> 01:27.424
Hey! That's my speech!

01:27.612 --> 01:29.955
Hey, that's her speech!

01:30.502 --> 01:31.713
(chuckling)

01:36.037 --> 01:37.263
(meowing)

01:42.497 --> 01:44.153
(whistling)

01:46.255 --> 01:48.778
(chuckling evilly)
Good work, kittens.

01:48.950 --> 01:51.263
Our fiendish plan came together.

01:51.348 --> 01:56.388
Now victory and a really nice
Ferris Wheel will be ours!

01:56.461 --> 01:57.747
(laughing)

01:57.827 --> 01:59.231
Thank goodness I got this back.

01:59.311 --> 02:03.341
Otherwise, how would I introduce
my new Ferris Whee... what?

02:03.403 --> 02:05.216
What did... what
happened to my wheel?

02:05.275 --> 02:07.130
Simple, it's mine now.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.692
But wait, where is it going?

02:09.821 --> 02:13.052
Obviously it's going to Foggy
Bot... what?

02:13.077 --> 02:14.153
Ahem.

02:14.178 --> 02:17.466
That's not the way
to Foggy Bottom, not even close.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.370
Hey! Wheel, come back!

02:20.467 --> 02:22.583
You're going the wrong way!

02:22.831 --> 02:24.356
(panting)
no!

02:24.436 --> 02:28.059
Foggy Bottom is that-a-way!
That-a-way!

02:28.204 --> 02:30.848
I order you to stop!

02:31.864 --> 02:36.102
Uh, it's not going to stop.
(screaming)

02:37.805 --> 02:38.891
Oh! Ho ho oh!

02:38.969 --> 02:43.719
Not my beautiful hat!
Oh, what did it ever do to you?

02:43.914 --> 02:47.125
Fine! I'll just
steer you myself.

02:50.133 --> 02:53.422
Hey! I'm the first
one to ride this.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.461
(laughing)
Now, go right.

02:55.891 --> 02:58.414
Oh, rats. Where's the steering
wheel on this thing?

02:58.572 --> 03:02.025
Uh-oh! Ah! This thing
has no steering wheel!

03:02.070 --> 03:03.407
Where are the brakes?

03:03.437 --> 03:04.884
(screaming)

03:08.583 --> 03:11.629
That wheel is
wrecking everything.

03:11.696 --> 03:13.575
Oh, what are we going to do?

03:13.647 --> 03:14.700
(clucking)

03:14.753 --> 03:16.950
Of course, the Paw Patrol!

03:17.059 --> 03:19.555
Thanks, chickaletta,
for always being

03:19.597 --> 03:22.411
The cool-feathered head
in the storm.

03:23.342 --> 03:26.231
(phone ringing)

03:26.377 --> 03:27.528
Ryder here.

03:27.599 --> 03:30.153
<i>Ryder, my Ferris Wheel
is on the loose</i>

03:30.322 --> 03:32.028
<i>and rolling all over town.</i>

03:32.157 --> 03:34.287
How does a Ferris Wheel
get loose?

03:34.472 --> 03:36.489
<i>Mayor Humdinger, that's how.</i>

03:36.557 --> 03:37.840
<i>Can you please stop it?</i>

03:37.903 --> 03:39.668
Of course, Mayor Goodway.

03:39.801 --> 03:41.129
The pups and I are on it.

03:41.279 --> 03:45.450
No Ferris Wheel is too big,
no pup is too small.

03:46.297 --> 03:48.629
Paw patrol to the lookout!

03:48.707 --> 03:50.551
(All:)
Ryder needs us!

03:51.903 --> 03:54.254
Hey. Who turned off the lights?

03:54.343 --> 03:56.848
(barking and laughing)

03:57.465 --> 03:58.865
(Rubble:) Look out!
(Rocky:) Oh, no!

03:58.889 --> 04:00.028
(pups grunting)

04:00.541 --> 04:03.122
Hey, who turned on the lights?

Ryder, sir.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.680
Thanks for hurrying, team.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.828
Mayor Humdinger tried to take
Adventure Bay's Ferris Wheel,

04:29.945 --> 04:32.844
And now, the wheel
with Mayor Humdinger in it

04:32.977 --> 04:35.750
Is rolling all over town,
crushing stuff.

04:35.906 --> 04:38.166
(Mayor Humdinger:) <i>Help!</i> Yikes.

04:38.191 --> 04:41.711
We need to stop it before it
causes any more damage.

04:41.816 --> 04:43.586
So, for this mission,
I'll need...

04:43.677 --> 04:44.703
Chase.

04:44.794 --> 04:47.242
I need you,
your cones and megaphone

04:47.313 --> 04:50.359
to make sure everyone's safely
out of the Ferris Wheel's path.

04:50.516 --> 04:54.656
Then, use your 4x4 to tow it
back to where it belongs.

04:54.735 --> 04:56.609
Chase is on the case.

04:56.906 --> 04:59.641
Marshall, I need you and your
ladder to rescue

04:59.711 --> 05:02.602
Anything high up that
the wheel could bump into.

05:02.683 --> 05:04.180
I'm fired up!

05:04.338 --> 05:07.492

Phew. Help!

06:20.182 --> 06:22.598
Uh-oh. It's coming
back this way.

06:22.666 --> 06:24.207
Follow me, pups.

06:24.313 --> 06:26.106
Chase, stay ahead of the wheel

06:26.160 --> 06:29.145
And use your cones and megaphone
to keep folks out of the way.

06:29.218 --> 06:31.012
Yes sir, Ryder.

06:31.109 --> 06:32.746

(gasping)

06:48.168 --> 06:49.855
Except for a really nice banner

06:49.891 --> 06:51.152
<i>that just got put up.</i>

06:51.295 --> 06:53.784
- <i>Got it, Chase.</i>
- Marshall,

06:53.845 --> 06:55.775
Use your ladder
to take down the banner

06:55.835 --> 06:57.222
before it gets ripped in half.

06:57.326 --> 06:58.753
On it.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.387
(tires screeching)

07:00.740 --> 07:03.277
(barking)
ladder.

07:04.331 --> 07:06.643
(gasping)
Hootie, fly home.

07:06.711 --> 07:08.722
A giant wheel is
heading this way.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.433
(hooting)

07:10.586 --> 07:13.761
I know, it's huge.
That's why you need to go.

07:13.881 --> 07:15.714
Flap-flap! Fly away!

07:15.776 --> 07:16.800
(hooting)

07:16.830 --> 07:20.894
Uh-oh. Ryder, I think Hootie's
too afraid to fly.

07:20.925 --> 07:21.941
(hooting)

07:21.988 --> 07:23.260
Don't worry about the banner.

07:23.347 --> 07:25.870
The most important thing
is to get Hootie down.

07:26.034 --> 07:29.363
(Humdinger:) No, the most important thing
is getting Mayor Humdinger down.

07:29.416 --> 07:32.245
Hootie, come this way,
towards me.

07:32.334 --> 07:33.909
(hooting)

07:34.034 --> 07:36.386
It's okay, Hootie.
I'll help you.

07:36.508 --> 07:38.573
Oh! Whoa! Oh!

07:38.679 --> 07:39.940
Good owl.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.191
Nice one, Marshall.

07:41.253 --> 07:45.949
Now, drop Hootie down to me
and get out of the wheel's way.

07:46.144 --> 07:48.948
Got him.
(gasping)

07:49.160 --> 07:51.090
Uh-oh.

07:51.314 --> 07:52.478
Whoa!

07:52.545 --> 07:53.767
Help!

07:54.345 --> 07:57.790
You know, I don't love Ferris
Wheel much anymore.

07:57.876 --> 08:00.134
Uh-oh, it's time
to try a new plan.

08:00.322 --> 08:03.501
Chase, I'm going to need you
to do some fancy driving.

08:03.681 --> 08:04.837
Right, Hootie?

08:04.979 --> 08:07.516
All right! I'm your pup.

08:07.626 --> 08:08.751
(beeping)
Rubble,

08:08.846 --> 08:11.224
I'll need you and your rig to
help with my new idea.

08:11.321 --> 08:13.712
<i>Rubble on the double.</i>

08:15.874 --> 08:17.501
(siren blaring)

08:17.598 --> 08:19.454
Rubble, is the ramp in place?

08:19.573 --> 08:21.048
Ready and waiting.

08:21.163 --> 08:22.663
Great. Ready, Chase?

08:22.812 --> 08:24.246
(Chase:)<i> Ready.</i>
Go!

08:24.662 --> 08:27.727
(tires screeching,
siren blaring)

08:27.801 --> 08:29.985
Yee-haw!

08:30.178 --> 08:32.524
(horn honking)

08:32.839 --> 08:33.969
Wow, I did it!

08:34.739 --> 08:37.738
Now, let's see if
I can steer this big boy.

08:37.832 --> 08:38.900
Already tried!

08:39.198 --> 08:42.894
It'll... Never... Work!

08:43.000 --> 08:45.200
Let's go right.

08:45.764 --> 08:46.804
It worked.

08:46.918 --> 08:48.679
Now, steer it
onto the open road.

08:48.731 --> 08:50.179
We don't want to hit anything

08:50.272 --> 08:52.671
Or Marshall and Mayor Humdinger
could get thrown off.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.819
- Whoa!
- Huh?

08:55.875 --> 08:58.524
- <i>Skye.</i>
- Hi, Ryder. What's up?

08:58.584 --> 09:00.720
<i>I need you to use
your copter and harness</i>

09:00.868 --> 09:03.040
<i>to rescue Marshall
and Mayor Humdinger.</i>

09:03.126 --> 09:05.806
(barking)
Let's take to the sky!

09:05.979 --> 09:07.517
(Humdinger:)
Oh! Whoa!

09:07.597 --> 09:10.907
Now I know why
Ferris Wheels have chairs.

09:11.414 --> 09:12.782
Huh?

09:15.188 --> 09:16.274
Whoa!

09:16.314 --> 09:18.642
It's okay to stop
running now, Marshall.

09:18.790 --> 09:21.243
I would, but I don't think I can

09:21.492 --> 09:24.673
Whoa! Hey! What about me?

09:24.938 --> 09:28.719
Stand by. I'll be right back.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.589
Ready for liftoff.

09:35.714 --> 09:39.536
And thank you. I'll never
do anything bad again!

09:40.068 --> 09:42.982
Today.
(chuckling)

09:44.247 --> 09:46.607
Now that we have
everyone safely off,

09:46.732 --> 09:48.169
Can you stop it, Chase?

09:48.279 --> 09:52.614
Sorry, Ryder, I can steer it
but I can't slow it down.

09:52.694 --> 09:54.724
Well, if you can't
stop it on the ground,

09:54.797 --> 09:56.185
We'll try it in the air.

09:56.287 --> 09:59.208
Robo-Dog, bring
the air patroller.

10:02.925 --> 10:04.121
Okay, Robo-Dog,

10:04.161 --> 10:06.652
<i>Grab the Ferris Wheel
with the big claw.</i>

10:06.821 --> 10:08.793
<i>(barking)</i>

10:13.032 --> 10:16.574
Now this is the ultimate
Ferris Wheel ride.

10:16.728 --> 10:19.638
Whee!

10:21.122 --> 10:24.137
Our dreams have come true and...

10:24.237 --> 10:26.903
Oh, no one wants
to hear a speech.

10:26.957 --> 10:28.739
Let's start the ride!

10:28.853 --> 10:31.762
Mayor Humdinger,
from now on, that's your job.

10:31.899 --> 10:35.598
Aw, I never want
to see this thing again.

10:38.132 --> 10:40.270
And you kittens,
no cutting in line.

10:40.327 --> 10:42.520
You are definitely last.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.281
(meowing)

10:44.462 --> 10:45.978
Thank you, Ryder.

10:46.025 --> 10:49.540
Once again, I owe everything
to you and the pups.

10:49.623 --> 10:51.814
You're welcome.
Just remember,

10:51.945 --> 10:54.259
Whenever you have
a problem, just...

10:54.357 --> 10:56.173
(Pups:)
Whee!

10:56.334 --> 10:57.517
For help.

10:57.885 --> 11:00.752
