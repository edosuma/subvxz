WEBVTT

00:04.438 --> 00:07.239
It's your first paramedic
ride-along, so be chill.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.074
Not so good with the chill.
Yo, "affluenza," out of my way.

00:09.076 --> 00:11.043
You, what do we got?
I was at the party upstairs,

00:11.045 --> 00:12.711
and I found him out here
when I came down.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.113
Did he take something?

00:14.115 --> 00:16.181
I don't know.
Probably. It's a party.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.716
Probably O.D.'d.
Give him a shot of Narcan.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.318
I know. I got it.
Mm.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.324
Guess it's not opiates.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.192
He's got minimal respirations.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.261
Then we better intubate
or he won't make it back.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.096
Back these idiots up.
It's not a sideshow!

00:31.098 --> 00:33.332
Come on, guys. Back up.
You heard her. Back up!

00:34.368 --> 00:36.735
Sats are holding.
Run in a liter wide open.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.504
I'll check the blood sugar.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.142
I've got him. Go.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.753 --> 00:54.086
What happened?

00:54.088 --> 00:56.088
She fell from up there.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.424
I'm gonna need some backup.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.562
I stopped the bleeding...
Finally.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.431
You know, I almost lost
two patients this week

01:05.433 --> 01:07.366
who wouldn't clot
'cause of that damn medication.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.234
Blood thinners?
Yeah, but not warfarin.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.452
It's like these...
These new ones

01:10.453 --> 01:11.669
that these drug companies
market out to people

01:11.672 --> 01:12.805
before there's an antidote.

01:12.807 --> 01:14.473
Anyway, I sutured
the laceration,

01:14.475 --> 01:15.607
so he should be ready
for surgery now.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.443
Okay, I already paged Scott.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.244
Okay.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.879
Hey, what are you doing?

01:20.880 --> 01:22.513
You can't do that right here
in the middle of the ER.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.284
Aw, I just do it it
to piss you off.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.186
Yeah, well,
nobody wants to see that.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.321
Speak for yourself, Topher.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.792
Hey, it's the pros from Dover.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.829
You have a lacerated spleen
in trauma 1 ready for surgery.

01:36.831 --> 01:38.397
Probably needs to come out.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.799
All right. Paul, get him
prepped in OR 1.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.200
I'm right behind you, and we'll
go over the powerpoint later.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.235
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.404
Uh, pow-powerpoint?

01:45.406 --> 01:47.372
Yeah.
I've been hounding the folks

01:47.374 --> 01:49.475
at Pressler pharmaceuticals
for months

01:49.477 --> 01:51.210
to get them to choose us for one
of their studies.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.845
They've got this high-tech
transcatheter valve...

01:52.847 --> 01:54.480
Gets patients in and out
of the hospital

01:54.482 --> 01:55.881
in, like, half the time.
So what's the holdup?

01:55.883 --> 01:58.684
The holdup is they're
only giving sample valves

01:58.686 --> 02:02.554
to four hospitals nationwide,
which means that we all

02:02.556 --> 02:05.858
have to bend over and grab our
ankles just to get a meeting.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.860
Sounds like a hell of a meeting.

02:07.862 --> 02:10.429
Hi. Uh, you must be
Dr. Clemmens.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.631
Jessica Sanders, Pressler rep.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.700
Hi.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.268
Don't worry. I won't make you
grab your ankles.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.370
Sorry about that.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.105
I thought you were coming
tomorrow.

02:20.106 --> 02:21.839
Yeah, change of plans. I gotta
fly out to Denver tomorrow,

02:21.842 --> 02:24.176
so I decided to pop by tonight
to check out your application.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.879
Yeah, um, well, I've gotta get
up to surgery right now, but...

02:26.881 --> 02:28.714
No worries. I'll be here
when you're ready.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.617
Just hang out with...
With Dr. Zia and Dr...

02:31.619 --> 02:32.885
Callahan.

02:32.887 --> 02:35.187
H-have we met?
Uh, no, you'd remember,

02:35.189 --> 02:36.321
but you're just the man
I wanna talk to.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.856
I just got paged.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.458
I'm gonna go change
in the locker room.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.792
Nice to meet you.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.294
Maybe we'll see each other
again.

02:43.531 --> 02:47.332
So... Dr. Zia... Yes?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.485
Who do I have to sleep with

02:49.486 --> 02:51.637
to get San Antonio memorial to
switch to our drugs exclusively?

02:51.639 --> 02:54.239
Well, it... it...
I... technically...

02:54.241 --> 02:56.508
Oh, no, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.643
It's a joke.
I know.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.912
But I'd love the contract, so...

02:59.914 --> 03:01.580
Can we talk business?

03:01.582 --> 03:03.348
Huh.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.951
Hannah?

03:05.953 --> 03:08.353
Hi. I'm Dr. Alexander.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.290
So I hear that you came in
with a fever.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.492
That's what they told me
over at the infusion center.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.294
Mm-hmm.
Cancer.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.529
That's where I go for chemo.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.851
The doctor said I spiked a fever
and referred me to the ER.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.668
Yeah, still looks a little high.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.570
All right,
can you lay down for me?

03:27.942 --> 03:29.474
Ah, you recently had surgery.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.777
About three weeks ago.
Second time under the knife.

03:31.779 --> 03:35.614
Went in to remove some tumors
that metastasized to my liver.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.382
Okay.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.286
Any pain or soreness
when I press?

03:41.288 --> 03:42.588
No.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.855
All right, well, I'd like
to give you some Tylenol

03:43.857 --> 03:45.824
to bring the fever down,

03:45.825 --> 03:47.792
but I also want to run a full
septic work-up.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.262
And a ct to look for
a post-op abscess?

03:50.264 --> 03:52.764
I've been going through this
for awhile now.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.400
Mm.
I practically live in hospitals.

03:55.402 --> 03:59.504
And I hate these places...
The smells, the sterile walls,

03:59.506 --> 04:01.373
the hum
of the fluorescent lights.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.508
Good point.
You know what? I'm out of here.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.776
I'm sorry.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.478
I didn't mean to crap
on your workplace.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.347
Honey, please.
Last month, we had a guy in here

04:08.349 --> 04:09.982
who <i> literally</i> crapped on
the place.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.550
Oh, no. Really?

04:11.552 --> 04:13.072
Oh, yeah.
It's the glamour of medicine.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.588
Okay, let's run the tests.
Mm-hmm.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.558
But FYI, I am not eating
the cafeteria food.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.493
Well, FYI, I don't either.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.728
Mm.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.664
Okay, let's listen
to your heart.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.500
Those are pretty necklaces.
Thanks.

04:28.502 --> 04:32.638
Doctor, over here.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.223
What do we got?

04:34.224 --> 04:35.807
Dumb, drunk, rich college kids.
That's what I got.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.392
She fell from
a 4-story balcony.

04:37.393 --> 04:38.976
I didn't want to move her.
Hey, how's her pressure?

04:38.979 --> 04:41.346
90 systolic,
and she's unresponsive.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.031
Alina? Oh, my god!

04:43.032 --> 04:44.715
Uh, I-is this your friend?
Y-yes, she's my roommate.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.385
What happened to her?

04:46.387 --> 04:47.986
I should ask you that.
I don't know.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.522
She was at a party and called
me, told me to get here.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.224
Pelvis feels unstable.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.925
Okay, we'll stabilize it
with a pelvic binder.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.594
Alina! Can she hear me?
I don't know.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.329
Hey, keep going
with the trauma survey.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.831
She may have other injuries.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.332
Oh, my god.
Her mom is gonna freak.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.601
Whoa.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.670
We gotta get her back
to the ER now.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.471
Hurry up with that backboard!

05:11.011 --> 05:13.345
On my count.
One, two, three...

05:31.865 --> 05:34.032
So it looks like there is
an abscess in your abdomen,

05:34.034 --> 05:35.400
and that's what's causing
the fever,

05:35.402 --> 05:36.635
so we're gonna get you
down to Ir,

05:36.637 --> 05:37.903
and they can have it drained
for you.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.771
More procedures?
Mm-hmm.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.340
Can't I just go home?

05:41.342 --> 05:42.908
Sorry. Not without
taking care of this,

05:42.910 --> 05:45.861
or the infection could
get worse.

05:45.862 --> 05:48.813
I just can't be in the OR again,
staring up at people in masks.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.351
Okay. Uh, tell you what.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.420
I will drain it myself here
in the ER using an ultrasound.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.622
That'll be quicker anyway.
Thank you.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.392
I just want to feel good enough
to get down to Mexico.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.660
Yeah? What's in Mexico?

06:01.662 --> 06:04.062
I rented a house
on the pacific ocean,

06:04.064 --> 06:07.499
this little town on the beach
named Zihuatanejo.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.102
It's from the movie...
"the Shawshank redemption."

06:10.104 --> 06:11.837
Oh!

06:11.838 --> 06:13.571
A fellow "shawshanker."
Yeah, I love that movie.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.107
That's the town they meet up
after he escapes from prison.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.909
Hey. Spoiler alert.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.428
Okay, dude, that movie is
20 years old.

06:19.429 --> 06:20.946
If you haven't seen it yet,
I doubt you ever will.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.882
But you should.
It's one of the best.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.417
Better than "fast & furious 7"?

06:25.419 --> 06:26.785
Yes.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.690
"Shawshank" is kind of
my inspiration.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.125
Like they say in the movie,

06:33.127 --> 06:35.694
"better get busy living
or get busy dying,"

06:35.696 --> 06:37.562
and that's what I'm ready to do.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.598
What do you mean?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.968
I'm done with chemo,
done with surgeries.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.438
I have a DNR.
I've made my peace.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.440
It's time to get busy dying.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.179
I don't know. You tell me.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.182
I asked you...
I asked you first.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.918
Oh, yeah. I can absolutely
come over later tonight.

07:01.488 --> 07:05.090
Oh, my god. You're so bad.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.860
Why are you so bad?
Oh, my god.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.529
Uh, maybe around 10:00?

07:10.531 --> 07:12.731
Drew and I have this little
errand we gotta run.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.767
Okay. All right,
I'll see you later.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.769
Who was that, Barry white?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.070
Come on, man. You know I don't
kiss and tell.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.473
Since when?
Dude, you know...

07:21.475 --> 07:23.108
Probably means I know her.
Who was it?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.893
I didn't say you knew her.

07:24.894 --> 07:26.677
So I don't know her?
Is that what you're saying?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.180
Hey, I think you took a wrong
turn, man. Where are we?

07:28.182 --> 07:29.981
We just gotta take
a little detour first.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.983
I gotta drop off Syd's daughter
at her jiu-jitsu tournament.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.052
Dude, no. No, we gotta meet
the craigslist guy

07:34.054 --> 07:35.754
for the gym equipment
in a half-hour

07:35.756 --> 07:36.988
or he's gonna sell it
to somebody else.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.056
I-it's gonna take 20 minutes.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.591
There's nothing I can do
about it.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.460
Sid sent me an emergency text
about an hour ago,

07:41.462 --> 07:42.828
saying I had to take her.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.195
I mean, apparently,
the grandmother doesn't drive,

07:44.198 --> 07:46.164
so, I mean... You wanna hear
the rest of the story?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.866
I didn't want to hear
the beginning, man!

07:47.868 --> 07:50.502
I just wanna pick up
the gym equipment. That's it.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.038
That's all I wanna do.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.140
Bro, who were you talking to?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.242
I'm so mad at you right now.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.480
That wasn't so bad, was it?

08:03.083 --> 08:05.517
So there's this pharma company
here tonight,

08:05.519 --> 08:08.920
and, uh, they're doing
experimental drug trials.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.889
No, thanks.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.524
You didn't even hear me out.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.092
I don't need to.
The last thing I want

08:14.094 --> 08:16.928
is another regimen of drugs
with unknown side effects.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.830
Come on, Hannah.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.731
You're still laughing and full of life.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.234
Then why are you giving up?

08:22.236 --> 08:23.935
I'm not giving up.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.937
I have accepted my fate.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.073
You don't know your fate.
No one does.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.708
I had this college friend
of mine,

08:29.710 --> 08:31.276
and she refused
to accept her fate.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.878
She fought it.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.813
Then she ended up living
for another three years.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.148
I mean, she <i> really</i> lived.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.818
Yeah, she saw her niece born,
spent two birthdays with her.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.854
She traveled
with friends and family,

08:42.856 --> 08:45.056
uh, went to
the great wall of China.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.292
And that's a really nice story,

08:47.294 --> 08:49.928
but I have a story, too.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.598
I watched my mother wither away
and die from breast cancer,

08:53.600 --> 08:57.702
and I fought for her
to try everything.

08:57.704 --> 09:02.007
In the end, she suffered through
treatment after treatment,

09:02.009 --> 09:04.776
to prolong what?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.845
Pain and suffering.

09:06.847 --> 09:10.749
Well, we've made a lot of
advances in the past few years,

09:10.751 --> 09:12.301
and there are
some promising drugs,

09:12.302 --> 09:13.852
and maybe there's something
that you don't know about.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.288
Hey, Hannah, there...

09:16.290 --> 09:18.323
There's gotta be someone
to fight for you.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.858
I'm an only child.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.193
There isn't anyone in my life.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.063
I spent my 20s going to school

09:25.065 --> 09:26.665
and my 30s taking care
of my mother,

09:26.667 --> 09:28.166
so there wasn't a lot of time
for dating.

09:28.168 --> 09:34.673
And now, well, a tinder
profile of cancer,

09:34.675 --> 09:37.742
tired all the time,
some vomiting,

09:37.744 --> 09:39.711
ain't gonna get me "swiped."

09:39.713 --> 09:43.148
So like I said,
I've made my peace.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.250
I'm ready to go.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.622
Okay.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.958
I am gonna go
and check your labs.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.728
So... You hang in there,
okay?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.703
Thank you.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.104
Well, that was fast.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.640
Color me impressed.
Thank you.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.175
Been waiting out here
the whole time?

10:10.177 --> 10:13.311
Dr. Zia got busy, needed
a quiet place to work, so...

10:13.313 --> 10:15.213
Hi. I'm Jessica.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.649
Uh, yeah, hi.
Uh, Paul Cummings.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.318
She's from Pressler.
A day early.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.954
Oh. Oh, uh, yes.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.789
So our surgical program performs

10:24.791 --> 10:27.258
over 50 mitral valve
surgical procedures per year,

10:27.260 --> 10:29.361
which is above or on par w...
Paul, Paul, it's okay.

10:29.363 --> 10:30.762
We're not doing that now.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.697
Okay.
I get the idea that Jessica here

10:32.699 --> 10:35.166
is more about the deal than
the presentation.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.635
Am I right?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.103
So what do we need to do to make
this deal happen for us?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.372
Because you guys have been
jerking us around for months,

10:40.374 --> 10:42.941
and that's time that a lot
of my heart patients don't have.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.243
I love the direct approach.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.647
Okay, uh, off the record...

10:48.649 --> 10:51.349
I want your ER to give our
company an exclusive contract.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.817
Uh, you want us to only offer

10:52.819 --> 10:55.820
- your company's drugs to our patients?
- Yes.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.790
Uh, I'll settle for making us
your primary supplier.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.125
The profit will pay
for the heart valve study.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.093
Okay, well,
you'll have to convince

11:02.095 --> 11:04.362
a majority of our ER attendings
to sign on,

11:04.364 --> 11:06.264
and that all starts
with Dr. Zia.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.100
Supposed to give him my pitch
when his schedule clears.

11:09.102 --> 11:12.003
He doesn't really seem that
motivated to change, though.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.338
I guess I'll have to
motivate him.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.041
Uh, he's married.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.375
He's... he's married.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.110
Actually, he <i> is</i> married.
He's married.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.246
And he's got a teenage daughter
and twin 3-year-olds,

11:21.248 --> 11:22.914
and his mother just moved in
with him.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.818
The guy is bone-tired
and frazzled up to here.

11:26.820 --> 11:27.986
Can you say conference?

11:27.988 --> 11:30.321
I like how you think, doctor.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.358
Okay.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.160
I can work with that.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.397
Suspected O.D. no response
to Narcan. Pulse is weak.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.399
Let's get him into trauma 2.
Where's T.C. and Shannon?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.001
With the girl that fell
from the balcony.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.370
They're coming in.
Heather, send off a tox screen.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.408
Hey, Heather, where's Topher?

11:50.410 --> 11:53.278
He just stepped into trauma 2
with a patient.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.080
Yeah.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.882
<i>Blue team to ICU,
please. Blue team to ICU.</i>

11:57.884 --> 12:00.752
Uh, will you excuse me
one minute?

12:00.754 --> 12:02.287
Hey, uh, so... so, how long...

12:02.289 --> 12:04.189
How long you been working with...

12:04.191 --> 12:05.757
Uh, yeah, a-absolutely.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.759
It's all... all good.

12:07.761 --> 12:08.827
Talk to you later.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.795
Annie? You okay?

12:10.797 --> 12:14.099
Yeah, I'm good. I brought T.C.
some tacos from la Gloria.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.068
I've barely seen him all week.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.036
I thought, you know, he could
probably use the extra fuel.

12:18.038 --> 12:21.039
Well, since he's not here
right now, do you mind if I t...

12:21.041 --> 12:23.208
Yeah, sure. No, take them.
It'll be our secret.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.744
Nah. I'm good. Thank you.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.412
It's good seeing you
outside a meeting.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.380
Yeah, you, too.
Are you well?

12:29.382 --> 12:30.982
Yeah, I'm good. I'm just...

12:30.984 --> 12:33.451
You know, I'm trying
to keep busy. You know...

12:33.453 --> 12:35.320
Are you going
to the meeting tomorrow?

12:35.322 --> 12:39.124
I'm going if you're going.
You bringing the tacos?

12:39.126 --> 12:41.159
Well, we always run out of doughnuts.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.528
- Incoming. Patient fell four stories.
- I gotta run.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.463
Unstable pelvis,
open tibia fracture.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.499
All right. Trauma 1.
Paul, you're with us.

12:47.501 --> 12:49.200
Got it.
Annie?

12:49.202 --> 12:50.769
What are you...
What are you doing here?

12:50.771 --> 12:52.070
I'm good.
I just brought you a snack.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.305
Hey, we'll talk later. Go.
Uh, okay.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.341
T.C., I'm gonna go check
on the O.D.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.509
Right.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.844
Excuse me, miss,
you can't go in there.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.112
Come with me. It's okay.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.214
All right.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.415
What happened?

13:04.417 --> 13:05.850
He coded when we got him
in the room.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.118
He's been gone for 10 minutes.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.386
He's gotten epi, amiodarone,

13:08.388 --> 13:09.921
and we've shocked him
a few times.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.089
Let's go one more time.
Clear?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.357
Clear.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.492
Ugh!
Whoa!

13:14.494 --> 13:15.960
You okay?

13:15.962 --> 13:17.829
I'm fine.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.931
I just... I got too close.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.033
Sorry.
Stop CPR.

13:24.371 --> 13:27.238
Time of death... 8:24 P.M.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.409
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.845
Okay. Let's get a sterile gauze
on that.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.113
And somebody page ortho.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.449
Alina, I'm Dr. Callahan.
You suffered a fall.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.984
We're taking care of you.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.518
It hurts.
I know.

13:41.519 --> 13:43.052
We're going to give you
something for the pain.

13:43.053 --> 13:44.586
Nurse, push some morphine.
BP's getting a bit low.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.192
Yeah, the fracture probably tore
an artery in her pelvis.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.560
Have you called up the Ir?

13:50.297 --> 13:52.197
Uh, there's no time for that.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.898
Let's get her up to surgery.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.400
Let's go.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.140
Alina!

14:02.142 --> 14:04.909
I'm sorry.
We need to get her upstairs.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.277
I'm so sorry.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.946
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.148
Yes, it is. I jumped.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.417
I tried to kill myself.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.863
I don't get it.
I never saw her unhappy.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.130
I never thought she'd try
to kill herself.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.632
Sometimes it's hard

14:27.634 --> 14:29.334
to tell the people
closest to you, you know?

14:29.336 --> 14:31.502
You never really know what
someone's going through.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.538
I would know, though.
She's my best friend.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.307
It just doesn't make sense.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.075
I'm sorry. But they're gonna
take good care of her.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.377
Is there any family
that we can contact?

14:39.379 --> 14:42.013
Uh, she's from Delaware.
Her parents still live there.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.515
I-I have her purse back
at the dorm. I can go get it.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.034
That'll be great.

14:46.035 --> 14:47.552
Look, if you do that,
I'll go check up on her.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.953
When you come back,
I'll have an update for ya.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.089
Okay.
Great.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.257
Good to see you, Annie.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.892
Hey.
Hey.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.426
They're probably cold.
Sorry.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.395
Ugh. At this point,
I'd eat a horse.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.997
You're a lifesaver. Okay.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.064
Look, uh, why don't you
head home?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.165
And I'll see you
in a couple hours.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.034
I gotta go back to the OR.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.203
Oh, okay.
I'll... See ya later.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.671
- All right.
- You okay?

15:06.673 --> 15:09.374
Yeah, just a little ringing
in my ears still.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.676
I meant your... him.
Your patient.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.178
It can be hard when we lose
a patient.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.948
He OD'd. I did everything
I was supposed to do.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.349
I've seen people die before,
Topher.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.119
I don't get attached.
I'm okay, really.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.691
Excuse me.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.192
The patient in there,

15:28.194 --> 15:30.361
um, have you contacted
his family yet?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.230
We're still trying
to track them down.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.933
I can help. I do it for
the rehab center sometimes.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.935
You... you don't have to do
that, Annie.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.703
I know, but everyone seems
pretty fried,

15:38.705 --> 15:40.471
and you've all been
so nice to me.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.207
I'd like to help.
I could use the help.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.944
Thank you.
I hate making those calls.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.212
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.548
So I did a cost analysis,
and I think we can

15:50.550 --> 15:52.216
match what you're paying
or maybe even beat it.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.418
Man, you do not quit.

15:53.419 --> 15:54.619
Look, I get it.
You want the pharmacy contract.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.120
I said I'll read your proposal.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.022
But later, not now.
That's the best I can do.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.391
No problem. You're exhausted.
Maybe you'll have a clearer mind

16:00.393 --> 16:03.227
after an all expenses paid
vacation?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.266
I'm sorry?

16:08.268 --> 16:09.500
Pharmaceutical conferences.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.969
Florida or the Caribbean.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.670
All expenses paid
for you and your family.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.138
Or maybe just you and your wife.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.540
Little second honeymoon.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.242
Really? That...
That's all aboveboard?

16:18.244 --> 16:20.478
You're probably
the only ER chief in the country

16:20.480 --> 16:21.612
who's not taking them.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.748
And you don't have to go
to the lectures.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.183
I mean, hell, I never do.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.618
Um... Just...
Just out of curiosity,

16:27.620 --> 16:30.054
do you ever have one in Hawaii?

16:30.056 --> 16:31.556
Oh, yeah.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.558
Really?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.728
So hotel is included?
Just...

16:41.234 --> 16:42.650
Okay, are you getting her?

16:42.651 --> 16:44.067
Just make sure you're get
everything for Syd, okay?

16:44.070 --> 16:45.169
I got... I got it!
Okay, I got it.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.739
Come on, Riley.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.140
I gotta admit, man,

16:49.141 --> 16:50.540
this is way more fun than I expected, man.
Right?

16:50.543 --> 16:53.011
No, no, no!
Watch the single leg!

16:53.013 --> 16:54.779
Watch the Si... okay, okay.
That's okay.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.081
Get in the guard!
Get in the guard!

16:57.083 --> 16:58.416
Get that little Rousey wannabe!

16:58.418 --> 16:59.484
Okay, okay, okay. Patience, okay?
Get her!

16:59.486 --> 17:01.052
Patience!
Look for an opening!

17:01.054 --> 17:03.755
Good. That's okay. Yes!
You got this! The arm bar!

17:07.694 --> 17:09.761
She tapped! She tapped!

17:09.762 --> 17:13.031
Ha ha!
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

17:13.032 --> 17:16.166
Riley! Riley! Riley! Riley!

17:16.169 --> 17:18.703
Whoo! Yeah!

17:18.704 --> 17:21.239
That was awesome.
That was so awesome.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.040
Thanks, but I think
some of the parents

17:23.042 --> 17:24.442
are giving you dirty looks,
though.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.743
Haters gonna hate.
Exactly.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.045
Okay, but hey, look at me,
look at me.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.747
Okay, I scouted
your next opponent.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.448
She's bigger than you, so you
cannot let her take you down.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.866
Okay.
Okay?

17:31.867 --> 17:33.283
What if I just do this?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.722
Okay, okay, right. And then I do...
This.

17:35.747 --> 17:37.121
Oh, no! You're gonna trip!
You're gonna trip!

17:37.123 --> 17:38.289
Aah!
Ow!

17:38.291 --> 17:39.590
Oh, my gosh.
Whoa, Riley, you okay?

17:39.592 --> 17:42.727
I got her, I got her.
Riley, you...

17:42.729 --> 17:45.063
Sorry. What hurts?
Ow, my elbow.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.098
Ow. Ow.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.733
Hey.
Hey.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.601
You're working tonight? That's
four nights in a row, right?

17:50.603 --> 17:53.071
Five. I cannot wait
to have a weekend off.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.123
Ooh, speaking of which,

17:55.124 --> 17:57.174
I have a buddy who owns a b&b
up in hill country.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.410
I was thinking we could go there
for the weekend.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.812
What do you say?

18:00.814 --> 18:03.681
Sounds nice, um, but why don't
we stay around here?

18:03.683 --> 18:05.249
We can go to the bar.
We can watch a spurs game.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.418
I could...
Kick your ass in pool again.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.420
There she goes,
swimming under the boat.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.155
I don't know what that means.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.658
When I get you on the line,
you run off in a panic.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.176
It's no panic. I'm just...
I'm... I'm tired.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.693
No, it's cool. We're just
having fun, right?

18:16.696 --> 18:19.097
I gotta let out the line
a little bit.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.408
<i>Dr.
Alexander, lab's on line 1.</i>

18:20.432 --> 18:21.099
No big deal. Pool it is.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.234
Okay.

18:25.371 --> 18:28.372
Okay, we have to ligate
both internal iliacs

18:28.374 --> 18:29.774
or she'll start bleeding again.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.456
You got it. I'll start
the mattox maneuver.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.612
<i>Hey, doctor.</i>

18:34.614 --> 18:36.814
<i>How's that poor college girl?
Stable for the moment.</i>

18:36.816 --> 18:38.716
<i>You got two minutes.
You get Dr. Zia to sign on?</i>

18:38.718 --> 18:40.785
<i>Yep, Mai tais in Maui.</i>

18:40.787 --> 18:43.254
<i>But only if the other
attendings agree to it.</i>

18:43.256 --> 18:45.389
<i>What's my best approach
with Dr. Callahan?</i>

18:45.391 --> 18:48.259
<i>Well, besides a short skirt
and a bottle of whiskey?</i>

18:48.261 --> 18:50.161
<i>I would offer something
to the veterans clinic</i>

18:50.163 --> 18:51.295
<i>where he volunteers.</i>

18:51.297 --> 18:53.231
<i>Yeah, that's easy.
It's great PR.</i>

18:53.233 --> 18:56.267
<i>What about Dr. Alexander?
Any idea how to handle her?</i>

18:56.269 --> 18:57.468
<i>Not a freaking clue.</i>

18:59.806 --> 19:02.406
<i>Sorry. Inside joke.</i>

19:02.408 --> 19:04.542
<i>Dr. Alexander
is the OCD "a" student</i>

19:04.544 --> 19:07.545
<i>who's gonna cross-examine you
on the data.</i>

19:07.547 --> 19:09.780
<i>Just overwhelm her
with your research.</i>

19:09.782 --> 19:11.415
<i>That'll get her to sign on.</i>

19:11.417 --> 19:14.352
<i>Thanks for the tips. That
heart valve's almost yours.</i>

19:14.354 --> 19:16.487
I think we might
actually get it.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.422
I genuflect in your direction.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.558
What are you talking about?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.827
Come on.
Topher and the vacation?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.762
T.C. and the vets?
Jordan and the charts?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.165
I mean, you're the...
The puppet master.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.167
You're the man behind
the curtain.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.835
You are keyser soze.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.739
No. Just trying to push things
along is all.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.341
That valve would be
a game changer for us.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.578
All right. Let's get
the other side tied off, okay?

19:40.580 --> 19:43.881
I just grabbed her whole purse.
Her phone should be in there.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.253
Is this hers?
I guess so.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.589
She seemed fine?
Didn't seem depressed?

19:51.591 --> 19:53.324
No, not at all.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.472
Toph is, uh, is that
pharm rep still here?

20:08.474 --> 20:11.342
I-I think she's upstairs
observing a surgery.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.811
But I-i can call up, tee.
What is it?

20:15.882 --> 20:16.882
Oh.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.589
Hey.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.757
How the hell
do you sleep at night?

20:26.759 --> 20:29.393
Uh, bourbon, usually.
Sometimes Ambien.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.095
Is something wrong?

20:31.096 --> 20:32.796
Yeah, the girl in there, she's
on ruprorin. Sound familiar?

20:32.799 --> 20:35.499
Yeah, it's an acne med
we offer. Works great.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.601
Yeah, it works great
for suicide.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.436
Um, what are you saying?

20:38.438 --> 20:40.304
Well, that girl...
She jumped off a balcony,

20:40.306 --> 20:41.439
tried to kill herself.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.773
Your drug causes
suicidal thoughts.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.442
That's one possible side effect,

20:44.444 --> 20:46.310
but her doctor
prescribed it, so...

20:46.312 --> 20:48.746
How about being responsible,
not putting out a bad drug?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.282
Okay, it's not a bad drug.
All drugs have side effects.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.134
Ibuprofen has side effects.

20:53.135 --> 20:54.985
That girl almost died
because your company cares more

20:54.988 --> 20:56.821
about the bottom line
than about people.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.723
You have no idea if that's
why she jumped.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.524
And my company has drugs
that curb AIDS,

21:00.526 --> 21:01.759
that slows the rate of cancer.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.344
And some of them, guess what?

21:03.345 --> 21:04.928
They have side effects
that include suicidal thoughts.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.397
So are you against those
as well?

21:06.399 --> 21:08.733
No, no, I'm against
compromising my integrity.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.351
Oh, come on, please.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.968
Like you don't have a smartphone
made by child labor in China.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.537
We're all compromising
something.

21:13.539 --> 21:14.739
Maybe some of us more
than others.

21:14.741 --> 21:15.840
I get it.
You're frustrated.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.008
You're raging
against the machine.

21:17.010 --> 21:19.310
But I am not the machine.

21:19.312 --> 21:22.847
No, you work for the machine,
and maybe that's worse.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.417
Excuse me.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.586
Excuse me, hi.
I'm Dr. Alexander.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.888
This might not be
the best time, but, uh,

21:30.890 --> 21:32.556
can I ask you
a couple questions?

21:32.558 --> 21:34.792
Sure, if I can ask you one.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.727
Why is that guy such a dick?

21:36.729 --> 21:39.363
Yeah, that's complicated.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.532
Uh, let me buy you a coffee.

21:42.769 --> 21:46.304
So you met T.C.?
Is that what they call him?

21:50.943 --> 21:53.544
I have to take him downstairs.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.446
Oh, okay.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.382
I've reached out,

21:57.383 --> 21:59.317
but I still haven't found
any close relatives nearby.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.651
I just didn't like the idea

22:00.653 --> 22:02.920
of him laying here all alone
without anyone.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.923
I don't think he'd mind,
but it's your waste of time.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.727
Did I do something
to offend you?

22:09.729 --> 22:12.930
No, not really.
It's just...

22:12.932 --> 22:14.332
You don't even know this guy.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.766
I don't get why you care
so much.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.769
Well, uh, because
I'm trying to help.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.638
It's part of the program.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.807
Ah. One of those.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.075
One of what?

22:24.077 --> 22:26.677
12-steppers?
Always preaching the gospel,

22:26.679 --> 22:28.746
trying to convert more members
to your little cult.

22:28.748 --> 22:31.782
It's not a cult.
What are you, 12?

22:31.784 --> 22:34.852
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.822
If you had any experience...
I've had experience with it.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.824
I've seen addiction take
a lot of people too soon.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.959
And I've been in the program
and seen it fail firsthand.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.828
Well, I'm sorry it didn't
work for you,

22:43.830 --> 22:46.764
but it's worked for...
Millions?

22:46.766 --> 22:48.399
Yeah.

22:48.401 --> 22:49.867
I know the spiel.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.636
Good luck. I mean it.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.443
10 years? You were with
that dude for 10 years?

22:59.445 --> 23:01.879
It was on and off, you know? But...
Oh, my god.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.415
In the end, we realized
that it wasn't right

23:04.417 --> 23:05.750
for us to be together.
So...

23:05.752 --> 23:08.119
You know, there's this whole
other side to him

23:08.121 --> 23:10.121
that not a lot of people
get to see.

23:10.123 --> 23:14.392
And honestly, you couldn't ask
for a more loyal person,

23:14.394 --> 23:16.660
to his friends <i>and</i> his patients.

23:16.662 --> 23:20.131
Well, I guess there's something
to be said for that, right?

23:20.133 --> 23:22.099
And he's not exactly ugly.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.402
No, he's not.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.971
So, uh, do you think you can get
Hannah get in on your new study?

23:26.973 --> 23:28.706
She won't fit
the inclusion criteria.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.641
Trial starts in two weeks.

23:30.643 --> 23:31.976
She's had chemotherapy
in the last 30 days.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.711
It disqualifies her.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.646
Okay, so there's nothing
you can do?

23:35.648 --> 23:37.782
I didn't say that.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.917
There's always something
that can be done, but...

23:39.919 --> 23:41.118
Let me ask you a question.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.620
What would it take
to get you to change

23:42.622 --> 23:44.522
your ER's
pharmaceutical provider?

23:44.524 --> 23:46.490
Hmm.

23:46.492 --> 23:48.492
Hey, guys, how's Alina doing?

23:48.494 --> 23:51.061
Uh, just took her to recovery.
She's stable for now.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.630
They gotta keep monitoring
her crits.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.665
Have you seen T.C.?

23:54.666 --> 23:56.699
No, I've been looking for him.
I heard he went off on Jessica.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.969
Yeah, the nurses could hear him
yelling from the OR.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.538
If he messed up
our heart valve...

24:00.540 --> 24:02.506
Yeah, I know. I already told
Janet about Hawaii.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.358
What?

24:04.359 --> 24:06.209
I... It's...
I'll... I'll talk to T.C.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.913
Yeah, like that'll do any good.
And nothing personal,

24:08.915 --> 24:10.514
but the guy doesn't listen
to anybody.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.016
Not me, not even you.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.185
And I try and keep the peace
with him, you know I do,

24:14.187 --> 24:15.653
but sometimes I just wanna...

24:15.655 --> 24:17.621
Yeah, no, I know. I get it.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.791
Sor... sorry about that. We just
really need that heart valve.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.443
Yeah.

24:22.444 --> 24:24.094
Over this way
to get you x-rayed.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.630
- Hey, what happened?
- Drew broke my arm.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.599
- Maybe you don't say it like that.
- Well, you did.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.701
What... who... who's that?

24:30.703 --> 24:33.504
That's Riley, Syd's daughter.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.289
Who's Syd?

24:35.290 --> 24:37.073
Yeah, the doctor drew was
deployed with in Bagram.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.454
Oh.

24:38.455 --> 24:39.833
Uh, we went to her jiu-jitsu
tournament tonight,

24:39.834 --> 24:41.212
and drew accidentally
fell on her.

24:41.214 --> 24:44.181
Wow, that's gonna be
a fun call to mom.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.549
Right?

24:45.551 --> 24:47.084
Topher. Hey, Topher.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.986
So, uh, I hear that you're open

24:48.988 --> 24:51.489
to switching
to Pressler pharmaceuticals.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.224
You do the research?
Yeah, you know, it looks good.

24:53.226 --> 24:56.727
Prices are competitive.
Same meds, different names.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.829
Are you open to switching?

24:58.831 --> 25:02.099
Yeah. Yeah, I'm open,
if you are.

25:03.236 --> 25:04.902
You know,
attacking her like that

25:04.904 --> 25:06.103
is completely unprofessional.

25:06.105 --> 25:09.073
Yeah, well, I was...
I was pissed.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.741
Well, my twins get pissed, too,

25:10.743 --> 25:12.843
but I expect a tantrum
from them. They're 3.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.945
Look, this heart valve study's
huge for this hospital.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.647
We'll make a compromise
here and there,

25:16.649 --> 25:17.882
I think...
I think we'd do it.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.184
Can you not stand right there?

25:20.186 --> 25:21.585
Yeah. Sorry.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.053
Hey! Hey!

25:24.590 --> 25:27.892
Topher, I'm... I'm
not gonna apologize.

25:27.894 --> 25:30.227
No, I didn't expect you to,
fonzie.

25:30.229 --> 25:33.597
Just sign on the deal. Do it for me.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.933
And for the... for the hospital.
Do it for the hospital.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.868
If it's not this company,
it'll be another one.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.004
All right, fine.
I'll do it.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.605
Yeah?
Yeah.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.807
Thanks.
Oh, and one more thing.

25:45.278 --> 25:48.045
Looks like you wet your pants.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.814
You should change your pants.

25:50.816 --> 25:53.551
You know payback's gonna be
a bitch, right?

25:55.588 --> 25:57.621
Hey.

25:57.623 --> 25:59.189
Fancy meeting you here.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.025
Hey.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.793
What are you still doing here?

26:02.795 --> 26:05.863
I-I didn't wanna be alone.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.098
That's why I brought T.C. food.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.768
That's why I helped Topher
with that OD.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.453
Yeah, I get it.

26:12.454 --> 26:14.137
Anything to avoid the middle
of the night struggle.

26:14.140 --> 26:17.107
Staring at the ceiling,
waiting for the sun to come up.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.009
Pretty much.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.779
I know you two aren't close.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.647
I know about
the whole Jordan thing,

26:23.649 --> 26:25.849
but he's been amazing to me.

26:25.851 --> 26:29.119
Taking care of me, helping me.
He's been my rock.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.654
That's really great.

26:30.656 --> 26:34.658
Yeah, but it's a lot
of pressure, too, you know?

26:34.660 --> 26:39.930
I feel like I can't be
totally honest with him, like...

26:39.932 --> 26:44.068
He'll be nervous
or get worried or...

26:44.070 --> 26:46.270
I just...
I don't wanna disappoint him.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.639
You know, it's gotta be
about you.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.207
That's what scares me.

26:50.209 --> 26:53.010
I keep thinking about that...
Man,

26:53.012 --> 26:55.980
that boy who OD'd tonight.

26:55.982 --> 26:58.782
I just keep thinking
that could've been me.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.319
It's not.

27:02.321 --> 27:07.725
You're here, alive,
working your program,

27:07.727 --> 27:09.627
step by step.
I know.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.629
But something that
Shannon girl said...

27:11.631 --> 27:14.231
Oh. Do <i> not</i> listen to her.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.200
She's mouthy, that one.

27:18.204 --> 27:21.672
Yeah, that's for damn sure.

27:21.674 --> 27:26.710
Still, I just...
What if I relapse?

27:26.712 --> 27:28.679
What if I'm not strong enough?

27:28.681 --> 27:30.280
Then you get back up
and you start over.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.282
Have you ever relapsed?

27:32.284 --> 27:36.253
Yeah. It was last year.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.022
I relapsed last year.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.129
I gotta take this.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.864
Uh, it could be a reaction
to the anesthesia?

27:46.866 --> 27:48.277
No, she must've had
a pleural tear.

27:48.278 --> 27:49.689
And the positive pressure from the vent

27:49.690 --> 27:51.101
has caused
subcutaneous emphysema.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.953
What does that mean?
Is she okay?

27:52.954 --> 27:54.804
Air from her lungs is leaking
into her soft tissue.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.240
Uh, guys...

27:59.245 --> 28:00.978
She's blowing up.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.763
Her sats are dropping.

28:07.764 --> 28:09.442
Subcutaneous air is
constricting her lungs.

28:09.443 --> 28:11.121
Do something! Help her!
We gotta release this air before she codes.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.390
Numb her up.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.459
Alina, can you hear me?
Alina!

28:15.461 --> 28:17.895
BP's down to 63 systolic.
All right, we gotta go.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.830
Stay with us, Alina.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.107
Pressure's holding.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.042
Okay, I need to make another incision.
All right.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.881
So, I, uh, I talked to
that pharma rep.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.218
And she's gonna try to get you
in on that trial study.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.187
I told you
I didn't wanna do that.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.122
Look, you are not gonna
make it to Mexico

28:45.124 --> 28:46.290
without some help, all right?

28:46.292 --> 28:49.193
You fainted, you have a fever.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.261
You need this. Thank you.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.797
Why can't you just
take "no" for an answer?

28:53.799 --> 28:56.166
I don't like to quit.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.435
It's not <i> you</i> quitting.
It's <i> me.</i>

28:58.437 --> 29:00.938
Why does that bother you
so much?

29:00.940 --> 29:03.273
Well, can't someone just care?
I mean, come on.

29:03.275 --> 29:07.344
Yeah, but there's always
a deeper meaning to it.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.079
What is this, a therapy session?

29:09.081 --> 29:10.914
Who's treating who here?

29:10.916 --> 29:13.984
I guess I didn't mention
what my job was.

29:13.986 --> 29:16.820
I'm a therapist.
Oh. Well, that makes sense.

29:16.822 --> 29:19.156
- Where have you been my whole life?
- I'm here now.

29:19.158 --> 29:22.926
So what do you think this not
being able to quit is about?

29:25.397 --> 29:28.766
Come on, let me feel like
I'm helping somebody again.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.834
You really wanna do this?

29:30.836 --> 29:35.038
You talk to me... I
will try your study.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.843
Feeling better now, huh?

29:39.845 --> 29:42.045
Yeah. That was scary.

29:42.047 --> 29:43.947
I bet.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.016
The air will continue to drain,

29:46.018 --> 29:48.919
so you might feel a little
swollen for a few more days.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.354
And you'll be immobilized
for a while

29:50.356 --> 29:51.822
with that pelvic fracture.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.323
But she's gonna be okay, right?

29:53.325 --> 29:55.325
Physically, she'll heal okay.

29:55.327 --> 29:58.095
Alina, we, uh, we need to
talk to you

29:58.097 --> 29:59.930
about the medication
you were taking.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.298
What medication?

30:01.300 --> 30:03.834
Ruprorin.
The acne medication.

30:03.836 --> 30:07.538
Yeah, it's got some
pretty serious side effects,

30:07.540 --> 30:10.407
including suicidal thoughts.
It wasn't the pills.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.076
I hadn't taken it yet.
What?

30:13.078 --> 30:16.280
It's just been really hard
for me this year

30:16.282 --> 30:18.849
with school
and just been feeling alone.

30:18.851 --> 30:21.285
Alina, why didn't you tell me
you were feeling that way?

30:21.287 --> 30:24.087
Didn't wanna bother anyone.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.424
The second I stepped off
the balcony,

30:27.426 --> 30:31.061
I changed my mind, but...
It was too late.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.096
Alina, I've been there.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.833
You have?
Yeah.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.434
When I got back from the war,

30:37.436 --> 30:40.304
I lost my brother,
and I didn't see any reason.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.472
But there was.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.608
And I got help.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.376
That was the best thing
I ever did.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.012
I'd like to go get someone
to come talk with you.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.380
Would that be okay?

30:50.382 --> 30:52.216
Okay.

30:53.219 --> 30:54.852
Are my parents coming?

30:54.854 --> 30:56.954
Yeah, they got in the first
flight to come see you.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.523
Can I stay with her?
Yeah, of course.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.392
We'll, uh, we'll check in
later. Okay?

31:10.135 --> 31:12.202
I'm just bummed I didn't get
to finish the tournament.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.937
I totally would've kicked
that girl's butt.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.906
Oh, yeah, if drew didn't
break your elbow,

31:15.908 --> 31:18.475
you would've smoked her.
Hey, it's not broken.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.211
Okay? Just sprained.

31:21.213 --> 31:24.081
You are gonna have to wear
this sling for a week.

31:24.083 --> 31:27.484
What? I don't even get a cool
cast for people to write on?

31:27.486 --> 31:29.920
Sorry. And I'm really sorry
about all this.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.722
I know it's not the best
way to end the night.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.491
It's okay. I had fun.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.361
And at least my mom will get to
see the video of my first match.

31:37.363 --> 31:38.929
Yeah, and she'll get to kill me

31:38.931 --> 31:40.364
when she comes home
and sees you.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.531
Yeah.
Yeah.

31:41.533 --> 31:42.933
You've been a trooper, though.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.501
You're pretty grown up for 13.

31:44.502 --> 31:46.068
I was a little bit of an idiot
when I was your age.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.304
Yeah, some say you still are.

31:47.306 --> 31:50.040
Yeah.
Hey, that's not funny.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.142
Oh, hold on a second.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.944
This is gonna be ugly.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.447
Okay, Syd, Syd,
before you yell at me, I...

31:57.449 --> 32:00.284
Let me talk to her.
Right.

32:00.286 --> 32:03.453
Yeah, okay. No, I'm giving
you to Riley, okay.

32:03.455 --> 32:08.926
Hi, mom. No, I'm fine.
No, it was all my fault.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.695
I know. I tripped.
I'm a klutz.

32:11.697 --> 32:15.165
But wait until you see
the match. I was awesome.

32:15.167 --> 32:18.268
There have been times
in my life...

32:18.270 --> 32:22.706
My father, uh...
He's dead, by the way.

32:22.708 --> 32:27.511
And in my personal relationships
where I feel like I have quit.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.379
I feel like I...

32:29.381 --> 32:31.381
Could've done more to help them.

32:31.383 --> 32:35.018
Um, since I don't have what
it takes in my personal life,

32:35.020 --> 32:38.588
I make damn sure not to quit
in my professional one.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.157
Whoa.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.259
You <i> are</i> messed up.
I'm sorry I asked.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.462
I gotcha, didn't I?

32:45.464 --> 32:47.581
Yeah, a little.

32:47.582 --> 32:49.699
Which tells me that
you believe that crap.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.034
Which crap?

32:51.036 --> 32:53.570
The crap about
you quitting on people.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.173
I mean, it's not as simple
as it sounds,

32:56.175 --> 33:00.310
but you know you bust your ass
with your patients.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.347
So why won't you give yourself
the same benefit of the doubt

33:03.349 --> 33:05.182
with your relationships?

33:05.184 --> 33:07.417
I don't know.

33:07.419 --> 33:10.287
Well, then that's what
we should be talking about.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.156
So that's when you relapsed?

33:13.158 --> 33:15.325
I settled the lawsuit,

33:15.327 --> 33:18.528
and I gave them
everything I had.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.464
I lost everything.

33:20.466 --> 33:24.301
But I still couldn't stand
the guilt.

33:24.303 --> 33:27.404
And I tried to go see him,
but they wouldn't let me.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.172
Still won't let me.

33:29.174 --> 33:34.745
And so then... I had a drink.

33:34.747 --> 33:36.413
Or 10.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.049
But then you just...
Stopped yourself?

33:39.051 --> 33:41.084
Barely.

33:41.086 --> 33:42.719
But it never even should've
gotten to that point.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.755
There's always help available,

33:44.757 --> 33:47.424
but I ignored it.

33:49.094 --> 33:51.094
I got cocky.

33:51.096 --> 33:53.230
Big-time surgeon,
great career.

33:53.232 --> 33:57.801
I figured all my problems,
all my issues are behind me.

33:57.803 --> 34:02.072
So... Didn't have a sponsor,
wasn't going to meetings.

34:02.074 --> 34:05.175
Well, I'll tell you what.

34:05.177 --> 34:08.045
The next time
you feel like that,

34:08.047 --> 34:10.047
you have to call me.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.382
And you'll bring tacos?

34:15.120 --> 34:17.521
I will bring you
anything you want.

34:40.478 --> 34:41.777
Hey.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.713
You wanted to see me?

34:43.715 --> 34:45.114
Oh. Yeah.

34:45.117 --> 34:47.217
Good news. She's in.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.518
Oh, so you got the trial
pushed back?

34:48.520 --> 34:50.087
Not exactly.
I messed with the dates

34:50.089 --> 34:52.589
of your patient's last
chemotherapy appointment.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.357
Uh, I didn't ask you to lie.
I mean...

34:54.359 --> 34:56.226
Do you want her to be
in the trial or not?

34:56.228 --> 34:58.295
Well, yeah, but...
Well, this is the only way.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.363
I'm going off of her records
from the previous month,

35:00.365 --> 35:02.599
which gives you the 30-day
buffer that she needs.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.635
I never saw the other ones.
You don't have to do anything.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.571
I'm doing it.
Just don't undo it.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.106
Look, I can't guarantee

35:09.107 --> 35:10.640
that this ER's gonna go with
your company.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.742
It's being considered,
but I can't be beholden...

35:12.744 --> 35:16.580
Stop, relax. Okay. I didn't do
this as quid pro quo.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.448
Your conscience is safe.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.552
Let's just say
I needed a win tonight.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.387
Offset some bad karma.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.456
All right.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.225
Thank you.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.260
I'll go tell her.

35:30.262 --> 35:33.196
Dr. Alexander!

35:34.433 --> 35:36.666
Shortness of breath.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.169
Hannah.

35:39.171 --> 35:41.238
Hang in there.
Everything's gonna be okay.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.407
Got some good news. We got you
in on that trial, huh?

35:44.409 --> 35:45.609
How great is that?

35:45.611 --> 35:47.410
My chest really hurts.

35:47.412 --> 35:48.545
I can't breathe.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.714
Okay. I need a crash cart,
please.

35:53.552 --> 35:57.187
Acute chest pain and hypoxia.
This is a PE. I'm pushing TPA.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.389
Page vascular and tell the OR
we're on our way.

35:59.391 --> 36:02.392
Jordan, she's DNR.
She doesn't want this.

36:02.394 --> 36:07.164
I know, but I just...
Let me go. Please.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.932
Jordan...
I wanna go.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.534
Please.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.643
Can you get her
some morphine, please?

36:19.645 --> 36:20.777
Yes.

36:51.243 --> 36:53.743
Hey, uh, Shannon.
Um, I'm glad I caught you.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.812
There's something
I-i need to say.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.747
What's up?

36:57.749 --> 37:01.451
Um, earlier,
when you seemed nonchalant

37:01.453 --> 37:03.353
after we lost the patient...

37:03.354 --> 37:05.254
Topher...
Just hear me out 'cause this is important.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.724
I know we see some terrible
things in this job.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.827
And in order to survive,
we do need to be able

37:10.829 --> 37:14.231
to compartmentalize certain
things and not get too attached.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.365
It's not that.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.367
Look, that kid who overdosed

37:17.368 --> 37:19.368
and then seeing that girl jump
because I thought she was drunk,

37:19.371 --> 37:20.604
it pushed my buttons.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.423
How... how so?

37:22.424 --> 37:24.241
Where I grew up, drugs
and alcohol are everywhere.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.743
So when I see some rich, white
college kid who has it all

37:26.745 --> 37:28.645
and just throws it away?

37:28.647 --> 37:31.248
I worked really hard
to get to where I am today

37:31.250 --> 37:32.916
and I almost didn't make it.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.285
I would've given anything to
have the opportunities he had.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.754
So I'm sorry, but I don't
have a lot of sympathy.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.023
Well, there's nothing wrong
with being proud

37:40.025 --> 37:42.726
of what you've overcome,

37:42.728 --> 37:44.828
but you do have to find a way

37:44.830 --> 37:47.864
to make an emotional connection
with your patients,

37:47.866 --> 37:50.400
no matter what biases
you might have.

37:50.402 --> 37:53.370
We all bring our own baggage
to every case,

37:53.372 --> 37:55.972
especially when you first start.

37:55.974 --> 37:59.342
But you have to find a way
to put that aside

37:59.344 --> 38:01.544
if you ever hope to grow
as a doctor.

38:01.546 --> 38:04.314
Okay. I'll work on it.

38:04.316 --> 38:05.515
Okay.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.916
I will.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.902
Jordan?

38:27.339 --> 38:28.605
So sorry.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.307
If there's any way
I can help in the future,

38:30.309 --> 38:31.541
please let me know.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.842
Thank you for everything.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.090
Uh, and... and listen...
Uh, thank you.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.409
Um...

38:49.410 --> 38:51.727
I-I just wanted to say that
what T.C. did was inappropriate

38:51.730 --> 38:54.331
and I wanted to apologize on
behalf of the entire hos...

38:54.333 --> 38:57.334
You can stop.
You're getting the heart valve.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.835
What? We are?

38:58.837 --> 39:01.671
Truth is, San Antonio memorial
was already one of the hospitals

39:01.673 --> 39:03.740
chosen for the pilot program.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.075
I was just kind of trying

39:05.077 --> 39:07.677
to squeeze a little extra
out tonight, so...

39:07.679 --> 39:10.814
Okay. Um, that's great.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.549
Uh, because, you know, uh,
we do have

39:12.551 --> 39:14.351
a very consistent track record
with...

39:14.353 --> 39:15.919
Paul, learn to take a yes.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.887
Yes.
You can go now.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.522
Yes. Okay.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.991
We got the heart valve, man.
Okay.

39:21.993 --> 39:25.462
So, uh, that's good news.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.581
I was looking for you

39:28.582 --> 39:30.532
'cause, uh, I wanted
to apologize for earlier.

39:30.535 --> 39:33.670
Was that it?
'Cause that was pretty lame.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.848
You're not gonna make
this easy for me, are you?

39:35.873 --> 39:36.573
No.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.408
Look, you don't have
to apologize.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.377
You're passionate about
your patients.

39:40.379 --> 39:42.078
That's more than admirable.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.814
Kinda feel like everyone
on this shift is, actually.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.751
Thank you for helping
Dr. Alexander.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.786
I guess I, uh...

39:49.788 --> 39:52.088
I may have been wrong about you.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.823
I shouldn't have said
all that stuff.

39:53.825 --> 39:58.895
Actually,
you were... Kinda right.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.131
Selling pharmaceuticals
and my soul?

40:01.133 --> 40:03.400
It's a BS job. I hate it.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.168
This was not my life dream.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.071
Got a job out of college
and was $150k in debt,

40:08.073 --> 40:10.106
student loans, and voilà.

40:10.108 --> 40:14.944
Six years later,
here I still am.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.613
Is that yours?

40:16.615 --> 40:19.616
Yeah.

40:22.821 --> 40:26.189
You know how to ride that thing?

40:26.191 --> 40:28.191
You'd be surprised
what I know how to ride.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.698
Give me a call.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.967
Maybe I can show you
a few more surprises.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.526
Hey.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.632
I heard, uh, I heard what
you've been through tonight.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.936
This is just not how
I expected things to go.

41:12.938 --> 41:16.039
I mean, we lose patients
all the time.

41:16.041 --> 41:19.259
It's just, sometimes there's...

41:19.260 --> 41:22.478
Yeah, sometimes you just find
one that really gets to you.

41:22.481 --> 41:25.014
Yeah.
I understand.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.750
You know, she wasn't afraid
of dying.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.219
She just faced it head on.

41:29.221 --> 41:31.254
I mean, I wish I had
that kind of strength.

41:31.256 --> 41:34.123
Hey. You do.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.158
I've seen it.
