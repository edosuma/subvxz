Hee, girls!

01:17.989 --> 01:23.790
Then maybe we can march on the
big Thanksgiving parade and then...

01:26.289 --> 01:31.426
Okay, Ramirez.
Remember there are steps, stop, step.

01:31.544 --> 01:34.972
Do not stop, stop,
poke in the nose, step, okay?

01:35.089 --> 01:40.392
It is the same routine as we did
all season. You can do it.

01:40.511 --> 01:42.060
Are you sure, Coach Gil?

01:42.061 --> 01:45.516
Yes, because the judge this year
lower the standards.

01:45.641 --> 01:49.153

01:49.270 --> 01:51.986

The headmaster wants to live march.

02:07.371 --> 02:11.463
Use or don't use,
I don't give a shit. Listen...

02:11.583 --> 02:15.676

02:15.796 --> 02:18.809
- So it can change our lives?
- Sure.

02:18.924 --> 02:22.720
- Should I put it on my euphonium?
- You what you figured up.

02:22.844 --> 02:27.234

- Nine minutes? Jesus...

02:29.100 --> 02:32.529

- To change our lives forever.

02:32.646 --> 02:34.899
Cool.

02:38.443 --> 02:41.990
- Rector Hanio, looking sharp.
- Do I know you?

02:42.113 --> 02:45.661
- Alice was going to the regionals.
- Alyson, yes.

02:45.784 --> 02:51.039
Alice. Do you think she
hits some guys in Florida?

02:51.164 --> 02:57.012
- Boys? What do you mean?
- Spring break. super hot guys. Muscles...

02:57.128 --> 02:59.975

- Girlfriend? We'll all be safe, ok?

03:05.803 --> 03:08.353
- I'm going to sit down.
- Absolutely!

03:08.472 --> 03:11.059
- See you on National.
- I doubt it.

03:29.535 --> 03:31.954
Wait, did you hear that?

03:39.086 --> 03:42.264
They can hardly wait. They love us.

03:43.339 --> 03:47.053
- Of course.
- Zoe!

03:48.636 --> 03:51.816
- Alice.
- Hi.

03:53.475 --> 03:59.775
- Do they look okay?
- Yes, check mine. What do you think?

04:02.400 --> 04:07.750
Girls, wear now.
Clothing should be worn.

04:07.863 --> 04:09.869
No!

04:14.203 --> 04:19.720
- You have some hair there.
- I shave before I go out.

04:19.834 --> 04:24.509
If we win today, we will
to national competition

04:24.631 --> 04:29.305
- In Florida.
- I've never been there.

04:33.055 --> 04:36.650
We're going to Florida!

04:39.019 --> 04:41.321
Boobs! Boobs! Boobs!

04:45.025 --> 04:48.787
- We're going to the national competition!
- Boobs!

04:52.241 --> 04:55.835
- We're going to the national competition.
- Get the hell dress!

04:55.952 --> 04:58.373
Okay.

04:58.497 --> 05:02.009
- I'm so proud of you.
- And I'm proud of you.

05:07.047 --> 05:14.889
I'm sure that we win.
My grandmother had to compete national.

05:15.013 --> 05:20.364
- My mom also.
- And now I feel I will also follow suit.

05:23.396 --> 05:28.117
I'm not going to say it again.
Give dress now!

05:28.234 --> 05:30.619
No!

05:31.780 --> 05:36.786
Girls, why are not you dressed?
Time for a formation. Hurry up.

05:38.161 --> 05:40.627
Man in the locker room!

05:40.628 --> 05:44.793
Turn off the camera!
They can see everything.

05:49.213 --> 05:51.716
Oh my God!

05:57.222 --> 05:59.475
How do I turn it off?

06:00.558 --> 06:05.232
This is, you, the audience seen,
Breast wobbling...

06:05.354 --> 06:08.118
in my office.

06:08.232 --> 06:12.455
Girls, we can learn that
we must stay away from drugs.

06:12.569 --> 06:15.500
Form a formation, ready in a minute.

06:17.407 --> 06:18.908
Give dress!

06:18.909 --> 06:20.352
Coach Gil.

06:21.852 --> 06:24.590
- You and the...
- Band?

06:24.706 --> 06:29.796
- Band? The tape and...
- Camcorder.

06:29.920 --> 06:36.979
We made a stupid mistake. Everyone makes her
own easy to laugh, but no one was injured.

06:37.093 --> 06:41.602
- That's not true.
- They do not have a chance.

06:41.723 --> 06:48.652
They can not even regional contest.
Oh god... You and I need a drink.

06:50.899 --> 06:53.947
- Sit down.
- No, I'll have a drink...

06:54.068 --> 06:56.223
...And pretend that
life has value.

06:56.224 --> 06:59.241
Gil. I can not believe
I'm going to say this.

06:59.365 --> 07:02.794
- You're going to the national competition.
- I'm going to get drunk.

07:02.911 --> 07:07.217
- We are pathetic!
- Yes, but that does not matter. Sit.

07:15.131 --> 07:18.761
- What did he say?
- If you are ruined for me, Zoe...

07:18.884 --> 07:22.017
- Me?
- I'm here on scholarship.

07:22.138 --> 07:25.270
- Scholarship? Can you get this?
- Yes.

07:30.771 --> 07:33.239
we will come to the national competition.

07:41.865 --> 07:44.120
It's time.

07:45.452 --> 07:47.174
Where the hell bus,
Coach Gil?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.758
It's too late. The
bus was always like this.

07:51.291 --> 07:54.589
- Are you okay, Snoopy rabbit?
- Poo Bear.

07:54.669 --> 08:01.515
I'll be in Florida, although
This Spring break. It's not my style.

08:01.634 --> 08:06.439
and also, I know that you will
along with your good friend, Hank.

08:06.556 --> 08:12.986
Yes, but anyway...
If you want to play in a porn video...

08:13.104 --> 08:17.115
What? I do not want to record
some porn video. Do you?

08:17.234 --> 08:19.997
- No, you know that I'm pretty...
- Small.

08:20.111 --> 08:23.041
- No, no...
- Very small.

08:23.156 --> 08:28.044
It's easy. We have drumstick
I use on you.

08:28.161 --> 08:31.423
- In addition to large...
- I compensate well for it?

08:31.539 --> 08:36.214
Not directly, but it does not. I
promises to only record movies with you.

08:36.336 --> 08:42.351
we can use the camcorder mother,
and then it does not look a bit. Okay?

08:42.467 --> 08:45.266
- I'll miss you.
- Me too.

08:47.388 --> 08:50.852
- Michelle, what happened?
- I missed my fucking plane.

08:50.975 --> 08:55.696
- My fucking mom never stopped talking.
- Your home sounds wonderful.

08:55.812 --> 09:00.867
- What do you mean by that?
- Relax, girls. Gather stuff.

09:00.985 --> 09:04.615
- Be careful.
- It's just a euphonium.

09:04.697 --> 09:06.183
No, it's Charlie.

09:06.184 --> 09:10.379
The only memory I have
left of my grandmother.

09:10.494 --> 09:16.461
Sorry. You may have to hang it on the wall,
and think about masturbation?

09:17.584 --> 09:19.921
I might have to think about you.

09:21.963 --> 09:27.847
I'm a little nervous.
I never drive like a big bus...

09:27.969 --> 09:34.067
It's like a car. D for advanced
R for reverse and P for parking.

09:34.184 --> 09:38.147
- It is important that I do not...
- I believe you, dear.

09:38.272 --> 09:40.739
Do not rush, a good idea.

09:42.567 --> 09:47.455
- Are we ready to ride on the bus?
- All instruments are numbered...

09:47.572 --> 09:54.168
Zoe... but should fly with the others.
It is entirely in the car and she is tough.

09:54.287 --> 09:56.332
No, I can not leave Charlie.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.673
You know, Zoe, you really do
have an natural relationship...

09:59.792 --> 10:03.754
- ... To the instrument is properly strange?
- No, he was my grandma's.

10:03.879 --> 10:12.600
I stand by it. See you in Miami
within two days. find out about that.

10:12.722 --> 10:15.818
Why does the ass here?

10:15.933 --> 10:17.558
You could take the plane
with the other girls.

10:17.559 --> 10:21.188
Are you kidding me?
And breathe the recycle air?

10:21.189 --> 10:26.575
- Do you know how dangerous it is?
- Whitney, you're in charge.

10:26.652 --> 10:30.116
- Of course, I'm.
- Hey coach.

10:30.239 --> 10:36.870
- Do we have chance with the nationals?
- No, but you can do well.

10:36.995 --> 10:39.078
See you in Florida,
drive carefully.

10:41.335 --> 10:42.908
We're be fine.

10:48.507 --> 10:52.267
Really? A school bus?
Let's go, retards.

11:05.607 --> 11:09.748
- Why Coach Gil like that?
- He's on medication.

11:10.945 --> 11:15.038
- No, he's trying to motivate us.
- This is the opposite of motivation.

11:15.158 --> 11:20.545
- I'm motivated. I read about it.
- It's called a reverse emocion empathy.

11:21.790 --> 11:26.678
He wants to force us to succeed by
break us down. It's a brilliant idea.

11:26.794 --> 11:32.014
- It's called psychological abuse.
- Our coach is a drunk...

11:32.133 --> 11:36.641
- ... But we won anyway, right?
- Yes.

12:50.835 --> 12:55.675
Zoe! Plays she really now?

12:55.798 --> 12:59.429
Place of hell!
We are trying to sleep.

12:59.552 --> 13:04.986
Stop fucking playing, Zoe! I drive
up your ass on you. Bring it here.

13:05.099 --> 13:08.611
I trying to practice.
I had to do it perfect.

13:12.106 --> 13:14.111
Zoe!

13:24.035 --> 13:26.584
We take a break on five minutes.

13:30.082 --> 13:32.336
Hey, Coach Gil.

13:33.126 --> 13:35.677
Yes, we just think to refuel...

13:36.714 --> 13:41.518
Whose clarinet?
Karen, that dumbass. Ok.

13:41.635 --> 13:45.775
Can you fill up the tank?
I have to look for one thing.

13:49.309 --> 13:52.488
Hey! Will you hem Spring break?

13:54.272 --> 13:58.033
- Spring... what?
- We may be seen down there.

14:00.028 --> 14:05.580
Take part in a wet t-shirt contest.
I'm curious on what you have down there.

14:07.619 --> 14:11.296
- No.
- Okay, it's too bad.

14:11.414 --> 14:14.594
- See you.
- Okay...

14:37.231 --> 14:39.201
A sign against Miami!

14:43.905 --> 14:48.294
Ready? Beat the drum,

14:48.409 --> 14:54.625
Beat the drum., beat the drum.
Play the flute, play, play the flute.

14:54.748 --> 14:58.212
Play the flute, play,
play the flute.

14:58.335 --> 15:04.635
Marching with the band,

15:04.758 --> 15:08.981
Win the Nationals, win,

15:09.096 --> 15:13.984
Girls! You do realize? We
have over 200 miles to go?

15:14.810 --> 15:17.609
200 longs miles.

15:18.563 --> 15:22.869
- Win the Nationals, win, win the Nationals!
- Jesus...

15:22.984 --> 15:27.161
The smoke from the hood!
This bus will be broken.

15:52.681 --> 15:57.485
Calm down! I'm staying!
Jesus...

16:03.608 --> 16:07.154
- What the hell did you do?
- Did you drive on anyone?

16:07.278 --> 16:12.331
- My uncle did it once.
- No, there is something wrong with the bus.

16:14.994 --> 16:17.841
Girls... Charlie's ok.

16:20.332 --> 16:24.093
- Everything is gonna be ok.
- Shut up with your stupid euphonium.

16:24.211 --> 16:26.465
How can we get to Miami?

16:27.548 --> 16:30.098
We can take the bus!

16:30.216 --> 16:35.188
- Morron. Somebody call a truck.
- Right...

16:40.269 --> 16:43.483
- What are you looking for?
- What do you think?

16:43.563 --> 16:45.865
About what?

16:47.901 --> 16:52.575
No idea. He checked under the hood
in the fifteen minutes. What should I do?

16:52.697 --> 17:00.255
- We will not.
- What? No, we're just 80 miles away.

17:00.372 --> 17:04.548
I think it's impossible, baby.

17:04.626 --> 17:08.718
Relax, we'll be here in a day or two.

17:10.048 --> 17:14.223
Wait a bit, he seems to be ready now.
I'll call you back.

17:17.262 --> 17:21.486
I'm not a mechanic,
but the problem is quite clear.

17:21.601 --> 17:26.321
- Have someone poured gasoline on it?
- Zoe!

17:26.438 --> 17:32.121
A bus must have a diesel!
The know anyone.

17:32.236 --> 17:37.623
- We go to college, not a kindergarten.
- You put gasoline in a diesel tank?

17:37.741 --> 17:44.123
- Damn!
- Sorry, but I never drive the bus.

17:45.916 --> 17:50.092
I'm don't feel so good guys...
I'm really hot...

17:50.212 --> 17:54.269
- Is that Elvis?
- You look a little strange.

17:56.217 --> 18:01.023
- You should probably get a new engine.
- And how much it cost?

18:01.140 --> 18:05.730
- Three or four perhaps.
- Hundred?

18:05.852 --> 18:09.732
- Thousand.
- Three to four thousand? Hell.

18:09.856 --> 18:14.163
Yes, and to find a mechanic in
weekend with Spring break and all...

18:14.278 --> 18:19.533
We have to go to Miami. our entire
band and our future depends on there.

18:19.616 --> 18:23.044
Sorry ladies. I wish
I had better news for you.

18:23.161 --> 18:26.957
You do realize what the reason
we're going to the Nationals?

18:28.750 --> 18:33.258
what what? We do. We are buying an engine
and go to the national competition.

18:33.379 --> 18:36.345
- Where we will get the money?
- Ask the Coach Gil.

18:36.466 --> 18:41.983
- It sucks!
- You killed the bus and our chances!

18:42.096 --> 18:45.394
You're killing my future
and my unborn children.

18:45.516 --> 18:52.445
I will live in a hole with losers.
I'll kill myself!

18:52.565 --> 18:54.866
Thank you, Zoe!

18:54.984 --> 18:59.788
- I'm sorry, I...
- Hello, my name is Constance.

18:59.905 --> 19:04.544
- I do not care.
- Do you write on Spring break-ban?

19:04.618 --> 19:08.082
- Do you have four thousand for a new engine?
- No.

19:08.205 --> 19:11.799
- So to hell with you.
- What is "forbidding breaker"?

19:11.917 --> 19:16.722
- Prohibit Spring break.
- They have fun. Why ban it?

19:16.838 --> 19:20.600
- Is it possible?
- Yes, and I have my reasons.

19:20.676 --> 19:24.223
- What did she mean?
- Girls,...

19:24.346 --> 19:27.894
Wait a minute! I got you.

19:28.017 --> 19:31.279
We go over here.

19:34.898 --> 19:38.576
- Franny?
- I feel hot.

19:38.694 --> 19:43.664
I'm dizzy.
Is there a JV that catch me?

19:45.242 --> 19:49.963
Take her out of the sun over there.

19:51.289 --> 19:56.295
Okay, come on. I got you.

19:56.419 --> 20:02.018
- You're doing enough.
- Wait! Fucking redneck!

20:03.301 --> 20:05.602
What a gentleman.

20:05.678 --> 20:09.901
No! What's up with the bus?

20:10.016 --> 20:14.441
- Take it easy.
- The National Competition!

20:14.562 --> 20:20.363
- Chill down.
- The girls go to Florida. Understand?

20:21.652 --> 20:23.934
You exert yourself too much.

20:23.935 --> 20:27.584
I do not care you're
married to my sister...

20:27.700 --> 20:31.046
But...you get fired
if they do not come to Florida!

20:31.161 --> 20:34.793
Remember that shit I gave you?
you should take a little more.

20:39.837 --> 20:45.270
- What is this?
- Heat stroke. Get some water.

20:45.384 --> 20:48.729
- Is she dead?
- No dead idiot.

20:48.845 --> 20:51.693
- But he did not move.
- She was just a little sunstroke.

20:51.807 --> 20:56.563
Bullshit. Do you know where I am?
Listen. You're such a bitch!

20:56.687 --> 20:59.652
Take care of this.

21:03.151 --> 21:06.745
- What? It works on TV.
- Can not you just die?

21:06.863 --> 21:10.790
- Look, Zoe. You saved her.
- She did not at all.

21:10.909 --> 21:15.251
- You can become a doctor.
- Can we learn? I get complex here.

21:15.372 --> 21:20.591
I should be on something fancy hotel,
not a grimy strip club!

21:22.379 --> 21:26.601
Your hands dirty.
Do not touch me.

21:26.674 --> 21:28.929
Rub it all.

21:51.615 --> 21:56.336
Okay, I'll get someone
who can salvage your bus.

21:56.453 --> 21:58.922
This is Gil.

21:59.039 --> 22:05.885
- What did you say?
- We must perform without instruments.

22:06.005 --> 22:10.264
- Is it possible?
- Ladies.

22:10.384 --> 22:13.309
You look like you need
something refreshing.

22:13.310 --> 22:14.180
Delicious..

22:14.304 --> 22:17.437
- Remove it.
- A real sydstatskille.

22:17.558 --> 22:20.192
Cooked in the south, jolly good.

22:20.310 --> 22:25.067
- This replica is old as your mistress.
- You look familiar. Are you a porn actor?

22:25.190 --> 22:30.577
As soon as the bus repaired, we draw
from this shit hole. Is that understood?

22:31.905 --> 22:35.915
Why is hot in here,
or is it just me?

22:40.997 --> 22:45.007
- Oh my God, I just got wet.
- You're all whores!

22:45.126 --> 22:48.804
- Focus.
- Focus on this.

22:48.922 --> 22:52.516
- Okay.
- I happened to hear a conversation.

22:52.633 --> 22:57.024
- You can easy money in this town.
- Not a chance.

22:59.557 --> 23:01.776
you've got great potential.

24:18.634 --> 24:22.099
Although we had the engine
it would take a week to fix it.

24:22.222 --> 24:28.984
- You are only seven or nine hours away.
- We can take a bus to Miami.

24:30.104 --> 24:35.278
And leaving the instrument?
Do you would certainly sound better?

24:35.401 --> 24:39.411
- We can send them.
- It's not the school can afford.

24:39.530 --> 24:46.043
- If you are not insured?
- Not with nothing covering them here.

24:46.162 --> 24:50.421
- What should we do?
- Do you really do this?

24:50.541 --> 24:55.927
- What do you mean?
- No, Okay, I'm driving up there.

24:57.173 --> 24:59.474
Fine.

25:06.932 --> 25:11.654
- Wow. Observing that.
- Let's get out.

25:18.610 --> 25:22.241
- I love cougars.
- Fuck you, I'm twenty-four.

25:22.364 --> 25:28.047
- MILF? I like that.
- MILF? Where did you find them?

25:28.161 --> 25:31.126
- What does Coach Gil?
- He drives here.

25:31.247 --> 25:34.261
- We do not have time enough in time.
- Probably not.

25:34.376 --> 25:36.795
- Get out of here!
- You can stay with me.

25:36.919 --> 25:40.384
Thanks, but no thanks.
No less thanks rather.

25:41.508 --> 25:47.274
- How will we get there before Sunday?
- We can travel in time.

25:47.389 --> 25:54.614
- Or fly, take a bus or train.
- Time warp is better.

25:54.729 --> 26:01.574
- But we have to bring instruments.
- Can not we just hire a big bus?

26:01.694 --> 26:05.870
- Guys, you probably have a big bus.
- I can show you a great coach.

26:05.990 --> 26:13.962
- How big?
- Awesome! Long, wide, swinging doors...

26:14.081 --> 26:19.337
- ... And emergency exits.
- Almost a little cliche, right?

26:22.089 --> 26:25.103
- Are you okay?
- Do you have a brain tumor?

26:25.218 --> 26:27.637
No, I need fresh air.

26:31.140 --> 26:38.151
We wait for Coach Gil.
He takes us to the competition.

26:38.271 --> 26:42.744
There are sixty-nine instruments in the bus
and six of them belonging to Sue Supone.

26:42.860 --> 26:47.166
We need another bus.
We not gonna make it.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.915
We have failed the whole band.

26:50.034 --> 26:53.627
- You, Zoe.
- We may hire another bus.

26:53.745 --> 26:57.968
- We do not have the money.
- Coach Gill has money?

26:58.082 --> 27:00.633
- Not so much money.
- How much?

27:00.752 --> 27:05.142
- A couple of thousand.
- It's better than four thousand.

27:05.256 --> 27:09.099
- Much better than four hundred thousand.
- Shut up, you idiot rigmarole!

27:09.218 --> 27:14.985
- She's not an idiot.
- Can everyone just stop talking?

27:15.099 --> 27:20.106
- From now on you must not talk.
- I hate you, Mom!

27:20.230 --> 27:23.860
Shut up, everybody!

27:23.983 --> 27:29.666
Here's the plan. I'm looking for
mechanic. Franny!

27:29.780 --> 27:37.290
For buses, we could hire.
And others keep you shelter, okay?

27:42.668 --> 27:51.389
- How do we get 2,000?
- Use your body, right?

27:51.511 --> 27:54.523
Do we agree? Come on.

27:57.975 --> 28:02.946
we really have to do a pole dance.
We are not getting any younger instantly.

28:03.063 --> 28:06.575
Do I have to show my cupcakes?
Craig calls them that.

28:06.650 --> 28:11.573
- Are you ready to write on list?
- Okay!

28:11.655 --> 28:15.831
Alice, you can not just write
on whatever. What is that?

28:15.951 --> 28:21.385
Look there. The city is full of prostitutes
saving the tacky behavior.

28:21.498 --> 28:27.216
- Okay, I see it.
- During a weekend every year...

28:27.337 --> 28:32.724
The city puts...
corruption and condemnation.

28:32.842 --> 28:39.771
It's called Spring break.
I call it "Hugs Spring break".

28:39.891 --> 28:46.024
For 48 hours transformed the city
to something resembling New Orleans-

28:46.147 --> 28:49.778
South Florida, even Mexico.

28:49.901 --> 28:55.156
With Latinos, Latinas, burritos,
tequila, whatever. Write now.

28:56.949 --> 29:00.792
- Awesome.
- Do you pay to see me dancing?

29:02.121 --> 29:05.004
- No.
- Dancers pond you too?

29:05.124 --> 29:07.841
- No, I do not.
- Are you shy?

29:07.960 --> 29:09.608
No, I just...

29:09.609 --> 29:14.770
You have nice breasts,
so you should dance.

29:14.884 --> 29:17.434
Can you write on here?

29:19.054 --> 29:21.522
Thank you.

29:24.601 --> 29:27.200
I wonder why she hates
Spring break so much?

29:27.201 --> 29:28.528
Maybe she is a Mormon.

31:04.533 --> 31:08.673
- Ladies. You're back.
- And you're sitting in front.

31:11.164 --> 31:16.170
- Happen to any of you to be a car mechanic?
- Is it an RPG?

31:16.294 --> 31:20.008
- No, seriously.
- No.

31:20.132 --> 31:25.435
- I might be able to help you.
- We need 3000 to fix the bus...

31:25.554 --> 31:29.480
- ... To come to Florida.
- Baby, you do not need to go there.

31:29.599 --> 31:37.524
Here craziest, coolest,
spring party here...

31:37.607 --> 31:41.569
... Start here.
- That you do not mean really.

31:41.652 --> 31:46.576
It does not matter. You can
nowhere before you partied with us.

31:49.494 --> 31:51.913
- Okay.
- Right.

32:10.055 --> 32:12.356
Damn!

32:19.314 --> 32:21.320
What the hell.

32:32.536 --> 32:38.918
- Sorry, did not mean to!
- The bar has been here for fifty years!

32:39.042 --> 32:46.303
It has never been changed, and now
completely destroyed! Get out!

32:46.425 --> 32:48.643
Out of my place!

32:51.805 --> 32:57.571
- Unbelievable!
- Go to hell, you bastards!

32:57.686 --> 33:00.070
And never came back!

33:02.941 --> 33:07.163
- Wow, that was...
- Very cool.

33:07.278 --> 33:13.126
She's one of the girls
"anti-spring break" dressed up.

33:13.242 --> 33:16.755
I hear exactly what you have done.

33:16.871 --> 33:21.676
Awesome. Bar owner Murphy sits in
the Government. A real scalp for us.

33:21.793 --> 33:25.304
- I'm not one of you.
- Yes, you have signed.

33:25.421 --> 33:29.976
- I did not mean it.
- I want to have a threesome with you.

33:30.092 --> 33:33.556
What? I...

33:33.637 --> 33:34.932
Where idiots go?

33:34.933 --> 33:38.312
Zoe does not to have
a threesome with them.

33:38.434 --> 33:43.108
- Fucking slut. What are you doing?
- It's not a threesome.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.694
I would go to the pole and
they drank a shot from my body...

33:46.817 --> 33:52.785
- And then start burning...
- Your friend shut down the strip bar.

33:54.116 --> 33:57.746
- It's not your fault, right?
- Technically...

33:57.870 --> 34:02.544
Technically, you're an idiot.
And why are you still here?

34:04.001 --> 34:08.556
Is there an answer to our bus?
Shut.

34:08.672 --> 34:13.061
It will never happen.
We are only making a joke.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.973
- She's just messing around.
- Let's go from here.

34:18.348 --> 34:20.815
No... wait.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.407
Wait! I found it. Jelly!

34:36.699 --> 34:43.379
Damn! What have I done?
I'm not driving too fast.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.922
Damn!

34:55.677 --> 34:56.467
- Hello there!
- Here is a jelly eating competition

35:02.349 --> 35:06.407
- How can we fix the bus?
- The winner will receive $ 800.

35:06.520 --> 35:12.073
- 800 dollars to eat jelly.
- And it is not enough for a new bus.

35:12.193 --> 35:17.198
- But we can rent one.
- Zoe, you are so smart.

35:17.322 --> 35:21.913
- Franny, we know that you love jelly.
- Yes, I do actually.

35:23.996 --> 35:28.634
I love this place. They pay
things that will be done for free.

35:28.750 --> 35:33.674
- It's true, I can live with eating jelly.
- I've seen it, really sickening.

35:33.797 --> 35:37.309
- Can you do it for us?
- Yes, if it takes us to Florida.

35:38.302 --> 35:42.358
- Awesome! It's probably at the rear.
- That's what she says.

35:42.472 --> 35:44.691
- Wait.
- What did she say?

35:58.988 --> 36:04.042
- Zoe!
- Alice! Ladies.

36:04.160 --> 36:07.423
Welcome to the forest jelly.

36:07.538 --> 36:12.047
What are you to say sorry,
or are you also going to close it?

36:12.168 --> 36:14.636
- I'm sorry.
- We forgive you.

36:14.754 --> 36:18.467
- Did you notice?
- We are here to win.

36:18.591 --> 36:24.024
- And we have someone who loves jelly.
- She loves it.

36:24.138 --> 36:28.563
And we have the jelly.

36:32.813 --> 36:37.036
- It is not hygienic.
- Yes, it probably is.

36:37.151 --> 36:41.030
- I will not eat it.
- Franny, the national competition.

36:41.154 --> 36:45.794
- No. Even if mom was dying.
- Time to jelly.

36:45.910 --> 36:50.548
Who dares to challenge
this nice lady in the jelly hole?

36:50.622 --> 36:54.418
- Some challengers?
- I'll do it.

36:54.543 --> 36:56.797
She!

37:04.595 --> 37:06.931
Will you not do it?

37:12.518 --> 37:16.529
- Excuse me?
- What's the coward?

37:16.606 --> 37:20.747
Coward! Coward! Coward!

37:20.860 --> 37:24.407
I'm no coward, you are a coward!

37:25.323 --> 37:29.036
Are you ready for the jelly?

37:31.287 --> 37:34.751
- Do you have the scoop?
- It is certainly not an eating contest.

37:53.059 --> 37:56.440
This bra is worth 30 dollars,
you fucking bitch!

38:15.455 --> 38:17.876
- Replace with me.
- Take me away from here.

38:21.294 --> 38:24.012
My name is Alice!

38:37.310 --> 38:39.647
Zoe!

38:55.245 --> 38:57.546
You scare me.

39:15.347 --> 39:21.528
In your face. These little girls
do not have a chance here or in Florida.

39:21.603 --> 39:25.068
Where are you? On a band camp?

39:27.609 --> 39:32.000
- We are in the camp band.
- Let me make one thing clear.

39:32.114 --> 39:35.377
There is nothing wrong with band camp.

40:17.909 --> 40:20.839
I'm the Queen of jelly, bitch!

40:22.788 --> 40:27.345
Jelly Queen. You're out!

40:27.460 --> 40:32.265
- You can not win!
- Who is the coward now?

40:32.382 --> 40:36.723
- Okay, where's the shower key?
- At home with me.

40:36.844 --> 40:41.732
- No, they need a real shower.
- What is it?

41:18.760 --> 41:22.272
- I think we are clean now.
- No, it's not you.

41:28.395 --> 41:32.025
- No more!
- Can we not just given our prize, thanks.

41:32.148 --> 41:36.454
- Yes, our prize.
- Your prize?

41:42.283 --> 41:46.756
Ladies, there are many more.

41:46.872 --> 41:51.628
Okay, but what about the money?
800 dollar prize winnings?

41:52.961 --> 41:57.635
- Dollar? Are you kidding me?
- No.

41:57.757 --> 42:01.268
- You're kidding, right?
- This is a beer-marketing festival.

42:01.385 --> 42:06.605
I get 23 liters of beer.

42:06.724 --> 42:10.437
- 20 Bottles 1.2 liters.
- What the hell!

42:10.561 --> 42:15.615
- This is a delicious beer.
- I hate you now!

42:21.864 --> 42:24.331
More for us.

42:25.492 --> 42:28.292
- It's not bad.
- Right?

42:28.412 --> 42:31.875
- Damn.
- It's better than McDonalds.

42:36.253 --> 42:40.180
Honey, you do not need to remind me.

42:40.299 --> 42:44.391
No, I am aware of
that the principal is your brother.

42:45.470 --> 42:49.527
What? Why must plumber sleep over?

42:50.266 --> 42:57.112
No, I do not buy.
There is not so large leaks.

42:58.483 --> 43:05.079
Ok? If it is so how are you want it...
Bye.

43:08.117 --> 43:10.419
Bitch.

43:11.454 --> 43:14.171
What!
What's going on?

43:15.541 --> 43:18.259
Flat tire or what?

43:19.004 --> 43:21.304
Damn?

43:27.678 --> 43:32.317
And I'm not even close.
Hell!

43:39.523 --> 43:44.909
- Hi.
- What do you have against Spring break?

43:45.028 --> 43:47.793
I'm not a religious fanatic.
It's all about the city.

43:47.907 --> 43:52.213
- It's all about you.
- The act of injustice.

43:52.327 --> 43:59.303
- You really need to lie.
- With the stupid bastard? Never.

43:59.418 --> 44:04.092
- Do you think they will be with you?
- I hate all of this.

44:04.214 --> 44:12.518
- I love men, not stupid boys.
- You need a LB in there.

44:12.598 --> 44:15.610
- LB?
- L... Forget it.

44:15.725 --> 44:19.606
You know neither me or town.
They need guidance.

44:19.730 --> 44:23.573
- And will you give them?
- I do not know, but yes.

44:23.692 --> 44:29.291
Then? What will you accomplish?
Take away the fun for everyone?

44:29.405 --> 44:36.167
No, we can still have fun.
Parlour Games. Good, clean fun.

44:40.207 --> 44:44.384
What a fucking shit.
Every fucking year.

44:44.504 --> 44:49.392
- Let's go. Damn prohibition jerks!
- But...

44:54.805 --> 44:57.060
wait.

44:58.225 --> 45:01.607
- Wait.
- You ruined my hair.

45:01.729 --> 45:06.652
- Franny is completely despair. Beer?
- I told you I was sorry.

45:06.775 --> 45:12.458
I did not know it was wrestling.
Do you think I'd let you do that?

45:12.573 --> 45:18.421
- No, not ever.
- You should not be talking about jelly.

45:18.537 --> 45:22.001
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly...

45:22.124 --> 45:24.841
Stop it!

45:27.546 --> 45:30.559
It was a well-meant mistake.

45:34.220 --> 45:38.561
I said I was sorry.
It just happened.

45:40.392 --> 45:45.232
Look. We can still take us
to the national competition.

45:46.398 --> 45:49.862
- Can I see?
- This is what counts.

45:49.985 --> 45:54.409
we do not show the breast for another beer.
we will stay at a motel.

45:54.530 --> 45:57.959
- I agree.
- It's probably just a joke.

45:58.076 --> 46:01.956
- Observing the price.
- A trip to Miami on a party bus.

46:02.080 --> 46:07.881
- What is a party bus?
- One that takes the band and instruments.

46:10.213 --> 46:14.139
Not a chance.
Zoe, I'm done with your nonsense.

46:14.258 --> 46:17.935
- No perverts get to see my breasts.
- Did they only just.

46:18.053 --> 46:23.191
- Yes, but I do not like it.
- But, we...

46:27.480 --> 46:30.991
I did not do it, then forget it, Zoe.

46:32.234 --> 46:36.955
I did not think you'd do it really.

46:38.824 --> 46:43.794
- Who is that?
- Objectively speaking, there is only one...

46:43.912 --> 46:48.338
- ... With perfectly shaped breasts.
- Who?

46:48.458 --> 46:51.223
- You?
- No, not me. Alice.

46:51.336 --> 46:58.312
- I? No...
- They are perfect, symmetrical...

46:59.678 --> 47:05.112
- You could be featured in Playboy.
- Do you really believe that?

47:05.225 --> 47:10.398
- Craig never said anything.
- Sweetie, Craig is gay.

47:10.522 --> 47:15.908
- He is a cocksucking ass boy.
- Impossible. He has a small dick only.

47:16.027 --> 47:19.704
- Not for these guys.
- It's pretty cute.

47:19.822 --> 47:23.536
"Hi Alice. This is little Craig.
Would you do it? "

47:23.660 --> 47:29.378
- There's nothing cute about it.
- You do not have to be naked.

47:29.499 --> 47:32.880
- No?
- It is a wet t-shirt contest.

47:33.002 --> 47:35.500
Do you keep the shirt on?

47:35.501 --> 47:39.847
Oh my God, the whole
school have seen them.

47:39.967 --> 47:42.471
- It's true.
- Set up for the team.

47:42.595 --> 47:46.771
- Okay!
- Come on, it starts in five minutes.

47:47.850 --> 47:51.064
This is the way.

47:53.856 --> 47:59.373
- Do we have go of this?
- Would you go to the race or not?

48:00.988 --> 48:03.324
We will probably...

48:09.162 --> 48:13.469
- Are we going to the Everglades?
- Did you hear that?

48:13.584 --> 48:17.546
- Beware of alligators.
- They are so cute.

48:17.671 --> 48:21.099
- And snakes.
- They are also sweet.

48:21.216 --> 48:26.685
- Poo would be cute for you.
- Craig forcing me to...

48:26.805 --> 48:29.569
No, we do not want to hear.

48:30.851 --> 48:33.069
Music!

48:47.450 --> 48:52.255
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

48:52.371 --> 48:54.756
- Hurry up now.
- I'm ready.

49:04.049 --> 49:07.099
Come on! What are you doing?

49:09.139 --> 49:13.729
It is the angled pedal to the right.
Shit.

49:20.733 --> 49:26.285
Go ahead, sign here.
Excellent. Number one. Next.

49:27.365 --> 49:32.668
Welcome. Write here, thanks.
Those will be excellent.

49:35.038 --> 49:38.716
- Control you all up here?
- Everything about spring break.

49:38.834 --> 49:42.844
- Are you going to shut this down also?
- No, not this time.

49:42.963 --> 49:47.435
- I wanted to show you my friend's tits.
- I see that.

49:47.551 --> 49:54.526
It pleases us, madam.
You will be number three. Here you go.

49:55.642 --> 49:59.604
- If you see cops over there?
- Yes, what is it with him?

49:59.729 --> 50:07.749
He has warned us that no one can undress
spring break-ban sucks.

50:07.862 --> 50:12.122
Thanks, I started there,
without trying to finish it.

50:12.241 --> 50:14.543
And trust me, no undressing.

50:16.163 --> 50:18.666
Good, next!

50:22.461 --> 50:25.509
You have to game now.

50:31.677 --> 50:36.731
Alice, throw your bra,
if you want a chance to win.

50:43.481 --> 50:47.788
- You can do it here.
- Okay.

50:48.861 --> 50:52.574
Okay, take this. Good job.

50:55.409 --> 51:00.546
Okay, welcome to the first wet
t-shirt contest during Spring Break!

51:00.664 --> 51:03.382
A big round of applause for the girls!

51:09.840 --> 51:13.802
Here we have participant number one!
Make her wet.

51:42.789 --> 51:45.588
Participant number two.

52:15.738 --> 52:21.254
Do not worry. Encourage her.

52:53.191 --> 52:55.493
Am I too late?

53:00.031 --> 53:04.456
Wait a minute. We have certain
a last-minute participants.

54:14.772 --> 54:19.659
You have broken the law if
disorderly conduct.

54:19.776 --> 54:23.833
- Pacific!
- No one was at off himself, I told you!

54:23.947 --> 54:27.459
One of the participants
will probably just be free.

54:31.579 --> 54:34.629
Come on.

54:34.750 --> 54:37.964
- Why they arrest him?
- Come.

54:44.425 --> 54:47.143
I'm so sorry.

54:47.262 --> 54:51.521
- It was not your fault, but Zoe.
- No, it was not Zoe's fault.

54:51.599 --> 54:57.401
- Did she ask you to be naked?
- I do not know anything.

54:58.231 --> 55:02.703
- Again she broke down a regional final.
- Not on purpose.

55:02.818 --> 55:05.868
I know, it is your fault.

55:08.324 --> 55:12.998
- Hello, girls.
- You certainly got what you wanted.

55:13.120 --> 55:15.706
- You are for this to brag.
- Can I say that her now?

55:15.831 --> 55:21.134
- No, she's cute and her hair smells nice.
- Really?

55:23.881 --> 55:27.558
- Damn.
- Thank you.

55:27.634 --> 55:34.100
Are you happy now? Zack is gone.
What should I do now?

55:34.224 --> 55:37.688
On Monday,
I work as an accountant again.

55:38.603 --> 55:41.487
Right. I turn into a pumpkin.

55:43.066 --> 55:49.033
This would be my weekend
until you came along and ruined it.

55:50.281 --> 55:55.419
I can not do anything right.

55:59.374 --> 56:02.173
Girls, hello...?

56:02.293 --> 56:06.968
- What did you do to her?
- I? She did it.

56:07.090 --> 56:10.803
Zoe is the smartest
and the most beautiful girl in the world.

56:10.927 --> 56:16.562
She once saved a cat and
let me write her homework. Leave her alone.

56:18.393 --> 56:24.027
I did not do anything. She feels good
until you show up, you're a freak.

56:25.066 --> 56:30.155
- We are not freaks, but a band.
- As can be national champions.

56:34.825 --> 56:38.586
Wait. Freaks?

56:40.915 --> 56:43.216
I like that.

57:04.980 --> 57:09.571
Shit. The first flat tire
First flat tire and now ran out of gas.

57:11.778 --> 57:17.413
- How is the situation? Guys!
- We're going to fuck your mom!

57:19.620 --> 57:22.205
Fucking asshole.

57:29.921 --> 57:33.432
Sorry, you are fine gentlemen.
It's easy.

57:33.549 --> 57:38.556
- We gonna fuck you in the ass?
- You is not no asshole, but the gentlemen.

57:39.889 --> 57:43.353
- It's okay.
- Is it true?

57:52.568 --> 57:56.448
I can not answer.

57:57.365 --> 57:59.998
I gonna go the message.

58:00.993 --> 58:04.670
What a day. Shit.

58:10.586 --> 58:13.551
- What the hell are you doing?
- Check it out.

58:15.967 --> 58:19.560
- But Spring break is not over.
- Well, that's it.

58:19.637 --> 58:24.311
The mayor got my application and she
is very close to writing in my ban.

58:24.433 --> 58:27.281
- We win. Thank you, girls.
- You're welcome.

58:27.394 --> 58:30.775
- We do not want to stop.
- We just wanted to Miami.

58:30.897 --> 58:34.113
- There's more to do. See you.
- Hey, hey.

58:36.403 --> 58:39.951
I hate her
and her beautiful blonde hair.

58:40.074 --> 58:44.664
Forget her. We're looking up the coach Gil
and pulls away.

58:44.786 --> 58:49.258
- I'm sorry
- How many times are you going to apologize?

58:49.374 --> 58:54.843
I'm not even angry anymore.
you did not do it on purpose

58:54.963 --> 58:59.684
but you can always ruin everything.
always you.

59:00.927 --> 59:07.439
Save it, okay?
My life is ruined, it's over.

59:07.558 --> 59:12.482
I might as well accept it.
I need a drink.

59:36.087 --> 59:42.303
- You there! Stop following us.
- Are you not in jail?

59:42.426 --> 59:47.564
- We know the sheriff, so...
- Listen, your disgust. We will put us...

59:47.640 --> 59:51.862
and... have a drink,
so stop sexy harassing us.

59:51.977 --> 59:56.117
What's the fun in that? Besizes
Zoe has ruined our Spring Break...

59:56.231 --> 01:00:00.822
- ... So we might as well be with.
- Excuse me.

01:00:00.944 --> 01:00:03.198
Zoe.

01:00:05.949 --> 01:00:08.203
- Shots!
- Idiot.

01:00:18.211 --> 01:00:21.805
- Are you okay?
- Not. I had a bad day.

01:00:21.923 --> 01:00:25.553
- May I?
- It would be incredible

01:00:30.891 --> 01:00:34.521
- What happened?
- Cursed Spring break-makers.

01:00:34.644 --> 01:00:41.536
- What evokes the animal in us these years?
- Lack of morality, bad parents...

01:00:41.609 --> 01:00:45.405
- ... Global warming, pop culture.
- Yes.

01:00:48.741 --> 01:00:53.795
What are you doing?
I'm married and so on...

01:00:54.789 --> 01:01:00.388
The thing is that my wife let the
plumber sleep over, so whatever.

01:01:07.969 --> 01:01:11.147
Zoe, wait! What are you doing?

01:01:12.681 --> 01:01:15.694
- I can get the money.
- Are you...

01:01:15.809 --> 01:01:20.531
- You can not sell Charlie.
- You said...

01:01:20.606 --> 01:01:27.664
Maybe I was shitty, but
it is because I love to win

01:01:27.779 --> 01:01:31.161
And you always ruin everything,
but you do not do it.

01:01:33.576 --> 01:01:35.796
Listen, I...

01:01:39.123 --> 01:01:43.798
I'm very tired,
and this trip was a disaster.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.345
If I can get the money
so we come to Miami in time...

01:01:49.926 --> 01:01:53.390
I thought you loved
your euphonium more than anything else.

01:01:53.513 --> 01:01:57.290
We have the chance to
become the best in the world.

01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:59.397
Maybe the best in the world.

01:01:59.519 --> 01:02:02.948
Only in the country technically, but...

01:02:04.899 --> 01:02:09.656
I have no doubt been a bitch
on this trip.

01:02:09.779 --> 01:02:15.497
- I owe you an apology.
- It's okay.

01:02:15.577 --> 01:02:21.378
you who you are,
and I am who I am.

01:02:21.499 --> 01:02:26.054
- Are you sure about this?
- This is a national tournament.

01:02:28.297 --> 01:02:30.302
Yes.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.982
She is okay.

01:02:39.725 --> 01:02:47.400
- What do you do when you're not drunk?
- I was lonely, pathetic accountant.

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:51.247
- I am a special education teacher.
- Take care of retarded?

01:02:51.362 --> 01:02:53.865
They are so cute.

01:02:53.989 --> 01:02:57.335
- Is it a replica or something?
- No, I love my Mongon.

01:02:57.451 --> 01:03:00.250
We came here on a school bus.

01:03:03.707 --> 01:03:07.717
- No way I do it.
- Why would we do that?

01:03:07.836 --> 01:03:14.348
- Do it there, you get loot.
- So, you can rent a bus.

01:03:14.467 --> 01:03:19.687
A good attempt off these cowboys.

01:03:19.806 --> 01:03:23.768
Is the next victim ready? Do not be afraid.
An attempt person.

01:03:24.769 --> 01:03:31.698
The record is twenty seconds.
Can you thirty win $ 100.

01:03:31.818 --> 01:03:37.666
$ 100 covers it.
Remember not wet t-shirt fiasco?

01:03:37.782 --> 01:03:40.630
- You mean you are like putting off?
- No.

01:03:40.743 --> 01:03:48.667
- Okay, it's okay. Drink up and enjoy life.
- Cheers to lay off!

01:03:50.336 --> 01:03:55.888
You're she.
I have seen the video ten times today.

01:03:56.008 --> 01:04:00.647
- Which video?
- Hey, take a picture.

01:04:03.641 --> 01:04:10.153
Wet t-shirt-contest.
The best video. Five million hits.

01:04:10.272 --> 01:04:17.248
- We are famous!
- Alice, this is very bad.

01:04:17.363 --> 01:04:22.037
- But we are famous!
- Anyone can view the video.

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:25.871
Can all? So everyone...

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:30.587
I said,
"I like the color of the future."

01:04:40.886 --> 01:04:43.354
Poo Bear!

01:04:44.263 --> 01:04:45.759
You're cute, you're cute,

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.571
you're really cute, you
are very cute also...

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:51.402
you're too high.

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:58.283
- Where have you been?
- Zoe sacrificed herself for the band.

01:05:00.655 --> 01:05:06.124
That means a lot of sucking and fucking.
Is that true?

01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:12.422
- Anal or what?
- Where did you get them from, Zoe?

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:17.298
- It's no big deal.
- She sold her euphonium for our sake.

01:05:17.421 --> 01:05:20.351
- What are you doing?
- I've really messed up, so...

01:05:20.465 --> 01:05:26.765
- But Charlie belonged to your grandmother.
- When did you become friends?

01:05:26.888 --> 01:05:30.152
we're on the same team
and have the same goal.

01:05:30.153 --> 01:05:32.027
we will win this together.

01:05:32.144 --> 01:05:39.285
That's still not enough. We need
at least 200 dollars to the bus.

01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:40.567
We can fix it.

01:05:40.568 --> 01:05:43.992
How will you participate
without euphonium?

01:05:44.115 --> 01:05:49.085
- Borrow someone else's.
- Breast I was there on the web.

01:05:49.203 --> 01:05:52.584
- Is it good?
- It's good for many others.

01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:59.548
- Who is going to ride this?
- I can do it.

01:05:59.629 --> 01:06:03.306
I have certainly missed something.
Bull, boobs, internet, what...

01:06:03.424 --> 01:06:07.517
- The bull does not give so much.
- I get nothing.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:09.302
All may well ride it?

01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:13.528
So everyone can get one
hundred U.S. dollars each.

01:06:13.643 --> 01:06:17.274
But I do not understand that.
It's fucking nasty!

01:06:17.397 --> 01:06:24.028
Okay, I'm on? But if I ride it
so must all do it. Is that clear?

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:31.746
- Zoe?
- Okay, I guess.

01:06:31.869 --> 01:06:37.587
- Who's first?
- I'll do it. Out of the way, ladies.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.463
I'll take a shootin.

01:06:46.258 --> 01:06:49.889
So are you ready to ride a bull?

01:06:50.012 --> 01:06:54.354
We have someone who will ride on bull.

01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:20.095
- You were totally useless.
- He had rigged it.

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:23.305
- Move the way, my turn.
- She's excited.

01:07:23.419 --> 01:07:27.382
we have a new competitor.

01:07:43.564 --> 01:07:45.534
I slipped...

01:07:52.365 --> 01:07:54.833
up with another victim.

01:07:57.453 --> 01:07:59.956
Queen Jelly!

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.140
She fell down.

01:08:32.696 --> 01:08:36.540
- Zoe, you are our last hope.
- It's over.

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:40.206
- No, I can handle it.
- You can not even go without falling.

01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:44.754
- I'll handle this, okay?
- Zoe, you can do it.

01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:57.849
Zoe! Zoe! Zoe!

01:09:45.267 --> 01:09:48.649
- Wow! Backwards.
- Yes!

01:10:01.408 --> 01:10:03.460
You are so sweet.

01:10:33.773 --> 01:10:38.530
- Zoe! Zoe!
- Amazing!

01:10:42.573 --> 01:10:45.422
Okay!

01:10:48.246 --> 01:10:51.094
- Remarkable lady.
- Thank you.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.837
I've never seen anything like it before.

01:10:55.962 --> 01:11:00.303
I have taken the bull where for ten years
and have never seen anything like it.

01:11:00.424 --> 01:11:02.893
So long it counts, right?

01:11:04.179 --> 01:11:12.945
It is another thing. There are
no rules, should not ride naked.

01:11:14.563 --> 01:11:17.528
- But it's not my fault.
- Yes, it's not right.

01:11:17.608 --> 01:11:20.158
There are rules.

01:11:21.737 --> 01:11:27.669
And there is another question.
Do you see the handsome man over there?

01:11:27.785 --> 01:11:34.381
- We'll talk later, guys.
- Does he know that you are serving minors?

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.889
- Are you underage?
- It depends on if we get the money.

01:11:39.004 --> 01:11:45.267
we have been raising money all day.
We're going to the national tournament.

01:11:47.054 --> 01:11:50.648
You probably have bigger
problems than this Miss.

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:56.365
I wish you luck.
Detective, they are yours.

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:06.325
- I want to talk to you, miss.
- It was not my fault, but an accident.

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:11.999
- To show themselves naked in public?
- Did not you see what happened?

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:16.343
- I will take testimony later.
- Even when you win, you lose.

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:21.096
I arrest you for
disorderly conduct.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:26.349
Everything you do or say
can be used against you in court.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:29.185
- Come with me.
- What are you doing?

01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:32.400
- Fucking asshole!
- Zoe!

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:41.991
It's the same thing every year.
Filling, naked, sex...

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:46.996
- I did not have sex.
- Zoe...

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:52.712
- Look who we found.
- How did you and... are you here?

01:12:52.826 --> 01:12:55.162
- She saved me.
- It's true.

01:12:55.287 --> 01:12:59.629
- Do they take you to jail?
- Fifteen years to life.

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:03.965
- $ 50? Is that all?
- Would you pay more?

01:13:04.087 --> 01:13:08.643
- No, that's fine.
- Have a good day. I have to work.

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:15.519
- Zoe, I should have known.
- My shirt got stuck in the bull.

01:13:15.598 --> 01:13:19.525
- Is that what you call it these days?
- It's true, totally fucking crazy.

01:13:19.644 --> 01:13:26.323
- If we win the contest, coach Gil?
- What... no, unfortunately.

01:13:26.442 --> 01:13:29.326
- Why do you look like he?
- How?

01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:32.660
- Have you been raped?
- Raped?

01:13:32.782 --> 01:13:41.051
- All day with this shit.
- Yes. We rent a bus to Florida.

01:13:41.165 --> 01:13:45.507
- If we are lucky we will get there in time.
- And if we're unlucky?

01:13:45.586 --> 01:13:50.723
- You ought to leave here immediately.
- You would like huh, Adolf?

01:13:50.841 --> 01:13:54.769
Yes, I would.
Besides that I go with you.

01:13:56.388 --> 01:14:00.102
Spring break is over. There is no
left here besides Walmart.

01:14:00.226 --> 01:14:05.196
- Damn! So it's over.
- I'm not fighting for a year.

01:14:05.314 --> 01:14:07.569
哦，宝贝
Oh, baby.

01:14:09.818 --> 01:14:13.615
- Florida, here we come!
- Is Florida not much worse than this?

01:14:13.739 --> 01:14:18.248
- Not if Gil is there.
- We'll find out there. Come on.

01:14:42.684 --> 01:14:46.361
- Any problem, officer?
- License and registration.

01:14:49.733 --> 01:14:55.748
- Unfortunately I've forgotten my wallet...
- You may not break the law.

01:14:55.864 --> 01:14:59.921
- No, but my girlfriend is...
- Driving a vehicle without a license...

01:15:00.034 --> 01:15:04.091
... Is a serious offense in the state
Florida. Especially without domestic plates.

01:15:04.205 --> 01:15:08.168
- Do you have any id-cone?
- I have no wallet.

01:15:08.293 --> 01:15:11.756
- Nothing?
- My name is Craig Wasserman and live...

01:15:11.879 --> 01:15:17.134
- I do not care what you say.
- This is urgent, I must go.

01:15:17.259 --> 01:15:21.602
- Get out of the vehicle.
- What? I can not...

01:15:21.723 --> 01:15:26.195
There is no preference.
You follow along to the station, come on.

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:28.611
I do not want.

01:15:31.232 --> 01:15:33.996
- Craig? Snoopy rabbit?
- Poo bear.

01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:36.529
- What happened?
- I have not done anything wrong.

01:15:36.612 --> 01:15:39.376
- Do you know him?
- Yes.

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:46.915
Hey, snoopy rabbit. You are free, but run
not until you have a driver's license.

01:15:47.038 --> 01:15:49.459
Get out of here.

01:15:50.417 --> 01:15:53.050
- What are you doing here?
- You may not go to Florida.

01:15:53.169 --> 01:15:57.346
- It is clear that we can.
- You do not go there because you won.

01:15:57.466 --> 01:16:00.929
- Are you kidding?
- Do you know why you get to go?

01:16:01.052 --> 01:16:05.146
- Do they like our personalities?
- Tell me, coach.

01:16:05.265 --> 01:16:08.647
You go because of the video clip
jumbotron.

01:16:09.645 --> 01:16:12.278
- What?
- I know it!

01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:19.489
I need a break. They will
make you laugh. I'm sorry.

01:16:19.571 --> 01:16:24.410
- Why?
- The headmaster got a call and you know...

01:16:24.534 --> 01:16:32.091
Your audience was huge,
so he was offered 10,000 for coming.

01:16:32.208 --> 01:16:38.092
- What should I say? You are popular.
- 10000 takes us to the competition.

01:16:38.214 --> 01:16:41.678
- Forget it, Zoe. It's over.
- Why can not we play?

01:16:41.801 --> 01:16:45.941
Why can not we play?
It's what we love and want to do.

01:16:46.055 --> 01:16:50.112
- Who cares if we are a joke?
- I do.

01:16:50.226 --> 01:16:54.900
- Me too.
- No, you should not do it.

01:16:55.022 --> 01:16:59.613
we go and entertain them.
We let them have fun.

01:17:00.569 --> 01:17:05.789
- Coach, you drive us to Miami?
- Yes, we should go even though we suck.

01:17:05.908 --> 01:17:09.372
- Even though we hit shit.
- I know I suck.

01:17:09.495 --> 01:17:14.251
- So do we all. Coach?
- Yes, we've come this far, so...

01:17:18.295 --> 01:17:22.518
I am pawn now, idiot.
I need my fucking money.

01:17:23.759 --> 01:17:27.389
Yes, everything!
No, it's not enough.

01:17:30.057 --> 01:17:32.310
Jump in.

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.129
- We're almost there.
- What's that noise?

01:18:03.547 --> 01:18:07.391
- What the hell is that?
- We will die, everyone!

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:13.063
- Silence! Calm down.
- Someone does not want us going forward.

01:18:13.182 --> 01:18:18.153
I can not see shit.
I can not run into this.

01:18:18.271 --> 01:18:20.607
- Stop the car.
- What?

01:18:30.074 --> 01:18:36.836
I put on my jacket. Hails it?
Talk on temperature drop.

01:18:36.956 --> 01:18:41.546
- Close the window!
- We are not insured for this!

01:18:41.668 --> 01:18:46.389
- Yes, I want a Christmas gift this year.
- Is that your final wishes.

01:18:46.506 --> 01:18:50.268
- No, it is not!
- Are you a libertarian?

01:18:50.386 --> 01:18:55.938
- Is this the end of us?
- Flower County evacuated.

01:18:56.058 --> 01:18:59.521
With me, I have a representative
from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.

01:18:59.644 --> 01:19:06.739
- John, what do you say about the storm
- How far is it to the stadium?

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:10.822
- They may postpone the contest.
- We have to come out.

01:19:10.947 --> 01:19:16.464
- They may postpone the event.
- If we do not show up, we washed.

01:19:16.536 --> 01:19:21.092
- Let me drive, we have to win the contest.
- Yes!

01:19:22.917 --> 01:19:26.299
- We have to win the race!
- Yes!

01:19:42.228 --> 01:19:44.447
Take it easy, we can do it.

01:19:51.738 --> 01:19:54.952
Calm down!

01:20:14.134 --> 01:20:18.393
We made it!

01:20:24.728 --> 01:20:28.275
- Everything is gone.
- This must be...

01:20:28.398 --> 01:20:32.325
there is a category 5 hurricane to
be canceled

01:20:32.444 --> 01:20:34.912
- No contest?
- No.

01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:39.499
- So clear...
- No, wait, we just got...

01:20:39.576 --> 01:20:44.546
We are from Woodville and have run
a huge stretch for this.

01:20:44.664 --> 01:20:47.761
- Did not you see the storm?
- And then?

01:20:47.875 --> 01:20:52.965
No one else showed up. There will be no
contest without auditioning.

01:20:53.089 --> 01:21:00.598
- But we have traveled all the way.
- So I guess we are the winners?

01:21:00.721 --> 01:21:04.814
Winner of what?
There is not any other bands here.

01:21:04.934 --> 01:21:08.809
You were the only ones
crazy enough to come.

01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:11.530
Technically washed all others.

01:21:11.608 --> 01:21:14.537
- Therefore, we win.
- She may be right.

01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:19.913
Sure. Here you go. Congrats.

01:21:24.703 --> 01:21:27.004
Thank you! Thank you!

01:21:28.374 --> 01:21:30.924
That's it. Girls!

01:21:38.467 --> 01:21:40.721
You deserved it.

01:21:43.179 --> 01:21:48.567
- Cute, right? Good shit.
- How did that happen?

01:21:48.686 --> 01:21:51.070
Maybe I can drink something out of it.

01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:56.242
We did not even...

01:21:56.243 --> 01:22:00.041
I know, but the victory
was apparently great.

01:22:00.155 --> 01:22:04.544
The chairman called me personally
to tell you about our new sponsors.

01:22:04.659 --> 01:22:09.499
Investors, all sorts showed up.

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:13.886
You did a great job for the school.

01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:21.096
I thank you.
If you need anything, let me know.

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.265
Anything?

01:22:56.077 --> 01:22:58.128
We're back.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.261
- Jelly!
- Oh yeah.

01:23:06.518 --> 01:23:12.518
(Zimuku version
without chinese)
