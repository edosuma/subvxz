00:03.248 --> 00:06.332
Look, Dad's gone now
and we have to carry out his legacy:

00:06.501 --> 00:09.419
Hunting down as many
evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.

00:12.841 --> 00:16.257
Back in 1835,
Samuel Colt made a gun for a hunter.

00:16.428 --> 00:19.594
This gun can kill anything.
Only four bullets left.

00:24.311 --> 00:25.721
Without them, this gun is useless.

00:25.896 --> 00:28.683
Only thing it's good for now
is figuring out what makes it tick.

00:29.649 --> 00:31.772
Cute piece. Won't stop a demon.

00:31.985 --> 00:34.939
- How the hell would you know?
- Call it an educated guess.

00:35.989 --> 00:38.943
Ouch. Do you want me
to help you out with that gun or not?

00:39.534 --> 00:41.823
That deal you made to save Sam.

00:42.037 --> 00:44.575
- A year to live.
- Been kind of liberating, actually.

00:44.789 --> 00:46.070
You're not scared?

00:49.376 --> 00:52.247
- Of course not.
- How certain are you...

00:52.463 --> 00:54.171
...that what you brought back...

00:54.340 --> 00:56.961
...is 100 percent pure Sam?

00:57.134 --> 00:58.759
Think something's wrong
with my brother?

00:59.928 --> 01:03.380
Demons lie. I'm sure Sam's okay.

01:04.016 --> 01:05.973
Yeah, me too.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:20.991 --> 01:23.826
You're the brick guy, I'm wood.
That's the way it's always been.

01:23.994 --> 01:27.197
I need someone to pick bricks.
Emmett, that has gotta be you.

01:27.373 --> 01:28.535
Not my responsibility.

01:30.417 --> 01:33.335
- Hey, what was that?
- I don't know. A dog, maybe?

01:33.837 --> 01:35.747
- That's a hell of a dog.
- Okay.

01:35.923 --> 01:38.544
We got a crew coming in the morning.
Look at this wood, huh?

01:38.717 --> 01:39.915
Look at it. It's crap.

01:40.135 --> 01:42.128
- Where'd you order it from?
- Same place as always.

01:42.304 --> 01:44.427
Should've used the cinder block
like I wanted.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.806
- Here we go again. You're not in charge.
- You know, you're a bunch of girls.

01:47.976 --> 01:49.720
Look, it comes down to this, okay?

01:49.895 --> 01:52.351
One gust of wind
and the whole place is gonna blow over.

01:52.523 --> 01:54.147
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

01:55.693 --> 01:57.187
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

02:27.723 --> 02:30.843
Kyle, come on, let's go.
- Okay, I'm gonna go warm up the truck.

02:43.489 --> 02:45.529
What the hell has got him? Jack!

02:47.660 --> 02:49.487
Jack!

03:49.054 --> 03:50.797
I don't understand, Dean. Why not?

03:50.972 --> 03:52.431
Because I said so.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.141
- We got the Colt now.
- Sam.

03:54.309 --> 03:56.634
- We can summon the Demon...
- We're not summoning anything.

03:56.811 --> 03:59.137
...force her to let you out.
- We don't know that'll work.

03:59.314 --> 04:01.307
We'll shoot her.
If she dies, the deal goes away.

04:01.483 --> 04:03.606
We don't know if that'll work.
You're pitching me...

04:03.777 --> 04:06.232
...a bunch of ifs and maybes
and that's not good enough...

04:06.404 --> 04:08.611
...because if we screw with this deal,
you die.

04:08.823 --> 04:12.157
- And if we don't screw with it, you die.
- I'm not gonna have this conversation.

04:12.369 --> 04:14.445
- Why? Because you said so?
- Yes, because I said so!

04:14.621 --> 04:16.031
Well, you're not Dad.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.702
No, but I am the oldest.

04:20.877 --> 04:22.252
And I'm doing what's best.

04:22.420 --> 04:24.911
You're gonna let this go,
you understand me?

04:33.640 --> 04:35.467
Tell me about the psychotic killer.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.967
Come on, Sam,
tell me about the psychotic killer.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.018
"Psychotic killer:

04:40.188 --> 04:42.726
Rips victims apart
with brute-like ferocity. "

04:43.233 --> 04:45.439
Okay, any mention
of his razor-sharp teeth...

04:45.652 --> 04:47.312
...or his 4-inch claws, animal eyes?

04:47.487 --> 04:49.195
No.

04:49.698 --> 04:51.026
The lunar cycle's right.

04:52.367 --> 04:54.858
If it is a werewolf, we don't have long.
Moon's full Friday.

04:55.036 --> 04:56.945
That's the last time he changes
for a month.

04:58.039 --> 04:59.415
Two days, no sweat.

05:02.711 --> 05:04.502
I'm Detective Plant,
this is Detective Page.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.462
We're with
the County Sheriff's Department.

05:06.631 --> 05:08.375
Yeah, uh, been expecting you.

05:08.967 --> 05:11.256
- You have?
- All morning.

05:12.095 --> 05:13.673
You are the sketch artist, right?

05:14.514 --> 05:16.257
- Um...
- Absolutely.

05:16.474 --> 05:17.506
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.510
That is exactly who my partner is.

05:19.685 --> 05:22.390
And the things he can do
with a pen, ha.

05:22.604 --> 05:25.274
But, listen, before we get started
on that, I wanted to ask you...

05:25.441 --> 05:27.350
...uh, how'd you get away?

05:28.610 --> 05:29.855
L... I have no idea.

05:30.946 --> 05:32.109
I was hiding...

05:33.282 --> 05:34.313
...and he found me.

05:35.117 --> 05:38.284
He was coming right for me
and then he just stopped.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.907
Stared at me with this blank look.

05:43.333 --> 05:47.283
After that, he just took off running.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.755
Okay.

05:51.175 --> 05:52.289
Um...

05:52.509 --> 05:54.835
...I'm gonna need as much
physical detail as you remember.

05:55.637 --> 05:57.547
Uh, yeah. Uh...

05:57.806 --> 05:59.680
He was about 6 feet tall.

05:59.850 --> 06:03.301
- Six...
- Uh, dark hair.

06:04.229 --> 06:07.433
Um, what about his eyes?
What color eyes did he have?

06:07.608 --> 06:10.063
Maybe blue?

06:10.235 --> 06:11.611
- It was dark.
- Blue?

06:11.779 --> 06:15.610
- Did they seem, uh, ahem, animalish?
- Excuse me?

06:16.074 --> 06:19.490
What about his teeth?
You notice anything strange about them?

06:19.703 --> 06:21.447
No, they were just teeth.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.539
Teeth. Okay.

06:23.707 --> 06:25.166
What about his fingernails?

06:25.375 --> 06:28.211
Okay, look, he's just a normal guy...

06:28.378 --> 06:31.961
...with normal eyes
and teeth and fingernails.

06:32.132 --> 06:33.876
- Look, sir, it's okay if...
No.

06:36.011 --> 06:37.470
No.

06:37.638 --> 06:40.722
Those were my brothers. This guy...

06:41.892 --> 06:43.766
...he killed my brothers.

06:45.562 --> 06:47.222
How would you feel?

06:48.356 --> 06:49.601
Humph.

06:50.650 --> 06:53.057
Can't imagine anything worse.

06:58.407 --> 07:02.073
I know this isn't easy, but if you could
remember any more details...

07:02.245 --> 07:03.953
There was one more thing.
He had a, uh...

07:04.121 --> 07:06.873
A tattoo on his arm
of a cartoon character. Uh...

07:07.083 --> 07:08.197
Oh.

07:08.376 --> 07:10.618
It's the guy who...
He was chasing the Road Runner.

07:10.795 --> 07:12.752
- Wile E. Coyote.
- Yeah, that's it.

07:14.882 --> 07:16.839
Kyle?
- Dr. Garrison.

07:17.051 --> 07:19.803
- How you holding up?
- Okay, considering.

07:20.012 --> 07:22.468
- You're, uh, Kyle's doctor?
- Yes.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.012
Can I just ask you a few questions?

07:25.851 --> 07:27.310
Sure.

07:30.898 --> 07:33.057
Don't I get to see it?

07:35.027 --> 07:37.316
Uh... Ha.

07:37.530 --> 07:40.282
Yeah, yeah. Um...

07:40.491 --> 07:43.694
Yeah, it's a, you know,
work in progress.

07:44.787 --> 07:46.115
Hmm.

07:46.289 --> 07:49.492
It's... It's really... Huh.

07:51.711 --> 07:53.834
Boy, this is a piece of, uh, art. Really.

07:54.005 --> 07:56.330
Yeah, like you could've done it better.

07:56.507 --> 07:58.583
What did the doc have to say
about Kyle's brothers?

07:58.759 --> 08:00.254
Not much.
They were DOA at the scene.

08:00.428 --> 08:02.171
He did give me the coroner's report.

08:02.346 --> 08:05.051
- Let me guess, their hearts were missing.
- Nope.

08:05.224 --> 08:08.059
But chunks of their kidneys,
lungs and intestines.

08:08.227 --> 08:09.258
That's just gross.

08:09.437 --> 08:11.844
Yeah, also definitely not
werewolf behavior.

08:12.023 --> 08:14.810
So, what, a demon?
Attacker could've been possessed.

08:14.984 --> 08:17.522
Why would a demon stop
halfway through an attack?

08:17.694 --> 08:19.770
I think that... Uh...

08:19.946 --> 08:22.437
- Could it...? I got nothing.
- Me neither.

08:27.245 --> 08:28.704
Okay, I am starving.

08:30.081 --> 08:33.782
- Wait, where are all the PowerBars?
- You ate them all and we're lost.

08:33.960 --> 08:37.126
We're not lost. The path is right here.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.000
Ow.

08:49.309 --> 08:52.096
Look, there.

08:52.270 --> 08:55.556
- Oh. Civilization.
- Yeah.

08:56.066 --> 08:57.857
Thank God.

09:09.245 --> 09:10.621
Are you two doing okay?

09:10.830 --> 09:12.953
- Hi. Actually, we're...
- Lost.

09:13.124 --> 09:16.161
Oh, it happens. The trail gets twisty...

09:16.336 --> 09:18.827
...and my house
is the only one left up here.

09:20.799 --> 09:21.913
Um...

09:22.092 --> 09:24.499
...I could point you
in the right direction...

09:24.677 --> 09:27.762
...but I'm afraid it'll take a while
to get back.

09:28.431 --> 09:31.966
You're really deep into the woods.

09:35.105 --> 09:37.311
Nice work, Ken.

09:38.274 --> 09:39.685
Um...

09:40.110 --> 09:42.517
Would you like to come in
and rest a bit?

09:42.695 --> 09:44.320
Um, yeah.

09:44.489 --> 09:46.565
Thanks, but we should head back.

09:47.075 --> 09:49.363
Oh, come on, honey, she offered.

09:49.576 --> 09:51.450
She's a harmless old lady.
What could happen?

10:16.019 --> 10:17.811
You sure you don't want more?

10:17.980 --> 10:20.684
No, thank you. It's, uh... Um...

10:24.111 --> 10:25.570
I'm full.

10:26.363 --> 10:28.106
- We should go.
- Mm-hm.

10:28.615 --> 10:30.026
We really can't thank you enough.

10:31.535 --> 10:32.994
Aah.

10:35.414 --> 10:36.445
Ken?

10:38.250 --> 10:39.661
You...

10:39.835 --> 10:41.709
What's going on?

10:42.004 --> 10:43.284
You...?
Are we...?

10:43.463 --> 10:45.207
Did you drug us?

11:02.232 --> 11:04.225
Julie, run.

11:04.776 --> 11:05.975
Stop.

11:06.153 --> 11:07.944
Please, you have to stop.

11:08.864 --> 11:11.984
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

11:12.159 --> 11:14.116
You just hold still now, dear.

11:23.252 --> 11:26.372
Stop! Stop, please stop!

11:26.547 --> 11:28.919
Why are you doing this?

11:29.091 --> 11:31.665
No!

11:31.844 --> 11:33.718
No!

12:04.743 --> 12:06.285
Please. Please.
Shh.

12:06.453 --> 12:08.860
We need to observe you.
The drugs may be in your system.

12:09.039 --> 12:10.533
I have to go. I have things to do.

12:10.707 --> 12:13.115
- Arrangements I need to make.
It can wait.

12:13.293 --> 12:14.787
Now you need to rest.

12:15.337 --> 12:16.914
Stay.

12:18.381 --> 12:20.255
Be back in a few minutes.

12:23.637 --> 12:26.472
- Detectives.
- Dr. Garrison.

12:27.641 --> 12:30.392
What the hell's going on here?
My whole town's going insane.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.054
We'll let you know as soon as we do.

12:37.651 --> 12:40.224
Ms. Watson? Hi.

12:40.403 --> 12:42.195
We just need to ask you
a few questions.

12:42.364 --> 12:44.072
Do we have to go over this again?

12:44.824 --> 12:47.280
- Now?
- We'll try to be brief.

12:48.494 --> 12:50.949
Ms. Watson,
can you tell us how you got away?

12:53.624 --> 12:57.408
I didn't eat as much as Ken did
so I wasn't as out of it.

12:59.505 --> 13:03.123
And when the old woman...

13:03.926 --> 13:06.298
...was carving up Ken...

13:06.470 --> 13:09.804
...I shoved her and she fell.

13:09.973 --> 13:11.800
Cracked her head on the stove.

13:14.436 --> 13:15.895
She's dead, right?

13:16.063 --> 13:17.723
L...? I killed her?

13:19.108 --> 13:20.934
Do you have any idea
why she did this to you?

13:21.527 --> 13:23.603
No. One minute...

13:23.779 --> 13:26.151
...she's just a sweet old lady...

13:26.323 --> 13:29.028
...and the next,
she was like a monster.

13:31.370 --> 13:33.777
Can you remember anything else?

13:36.250 --> 13:37.827
Um, yeah.

13:40.379 --> 13:43.629
Did you find a little girl there
by any chance?

13:43.799 --> 13:45.079
A little girl?

13:45.509 --> 13:46.624
At the house?

13:47.177 --> 13:50.381
I thought I saw her outside
the window.

13:50.889 --> 13:54.223
She... She just disappeared.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.768
Just vanished into thin air.

13:59.064 --> 14:01.816
- It must've been the drugs.
- This disappearing girl...

14:01.984 --> 14:04.475
...what did she look like?
- Does it matter?

14:04.653 --> 14:06.195
Yes, every detail matters.

14:09.158 --> 14:13.487
She had this dark, dark hair...

14:13.662 --> 14:15.406
...and really pale skin.

14:15.581 --> 14:16.826
She was around 8.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.583
She was a beautiful child. It was...

14:20.960 --> 14:24.709
...odd to see her in the middle
of something so horrible.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.010
Well, there's no sulfur anywhere.
How about the EMF?

14:36.684 --> 14:38.178
Yeah, it's going nuts.

14:38.686 --> 14:42.102
But only over here by the window.
There was definitely a spirit here.

14:42.273 --> 14:44.479
Who stood outside the crime scene
and watched.

14:46.903 --> 14:49.026
- Looks like.
- What the hell do you make of that?

14:49.197 --> 14:51.948
Actually, I do have a theory.
Uh, sort of.

14:53.034 --> 14:56.782
- Hit me.
- Well, thinking about fairy tales.

14:58.581 --> 15:00.075
Oh, that's... That's nice.

15:00.875 --> 15:04.125
- You think about fairy tales often?
- No, Dean, I'm talking about the murders.

15:04.295 --> 15:06.122
A guy and girl
hiking through the woods...

15:06.297 --> 15:09.084
<i>...an old lady tries to eat them.
That's Hansel and Gretel.</i>

15:09.258 --> 15:12.093
Then we got the three brothers
arguing over how to build houses...

15:12.261 --> 15:13.672
...attacked by the big bad wolf.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.044
<i>- Three Little Pigs.
- Yeah.</i>

15:15.765 --> 15:18.054
Actually, those guys
were a little chubby.

15:18.226 --> 15:21.511
Oh, wait. I thought those things ended
with everybody living happily ever after.

15:21.687 --> 15:22.850
No, no, not the originals.

15:23.022 --> 15:26.142
See, the Grimm brothers' stuff
was kind of like the folklore of its day...

15:26.317 --> 15:30.362
...full of sex, violence, cannibalism.
Then it got sanitized over the years...

15:30.530 --> 15:33.103
...turned into Disney flicks
and bedtime stories.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.367
So you think the murders are, uh,
what, a reenactment?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.446
- That's a little crazy.
- Crazy as what?

15:39.622 --> 15:40.820
Every day of our lives?

15:41.749 --> 15:45.332
Touché.
How's the creepy ghost girl involved?

15:45.836 --> 15:48.587
Um, well, she must've been here
for a reason.

15:49.422 --> 15:52.340
I'm willing to bet you top dollar
she was at the construction site too.

15:52.801 --> 15:54.461
We gotta do research now, don't we?

16:01.726 --> 16:03.968
- So?
- Checked every record they had.

16:04.145 --> 16:07.099
Found the usual amount of violent
childhood deaths for a town this size.

16:07.274 --> 16:08.768
- Okay.
- Know how many were girls...

16:08.942 --> 16:10.981
...with black hair and pale skin?

16:11.152 --> 16:12.730
Zero.

16:12.904 --> 16:15.395
You wanna know how many girls
with black hair and pale skin...

16:15.573 --> 16:19.156
<i>...have gone missing?
Right again: Zip, zilch, nada.</i>

16:19.327 --> 16:23.242
Tell me you got something good because
I've totally wasted the last six hours.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.039
Well, you ever hear of Lillian Bailey?

16:25.208 --> 16:27.782
She was a British medium
from the 1930s.

16:27.961 --> 16:30.796
- She got a thing for fairy tales?
- No, trances.

16:30.964 --> 16:33.419
See, she'd go into
these unconscious states where, um...

16:33.591 --> 16:38.052
Get this: Her thoughts and actions
were completely controlled by spirits.

16:38.638 --> 16:40.346
- The ghost Puppet Master.
- Yeah.

16:40.515 --> 16:42.009
Think that's what this kid is doing?

16:42.183 --> 16:45.884
Sending Wolfboy and Grandma
into trances, making them go kill-crazy?

16:46.062 --> 16:47.307
- It could be.
- Phew.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.185
You know, kind of like a spirit hypnosis
or something.

16:50.358 --> 16:53.893
Trances I get, but fairy-tale trances?
That's bizarre even for us.

16:59.659 --> 17:01.533
Yeah, you're right.
That's completely normal.

17:04.122 --> 17:05.996
All right, maybe it is fairy tales.

17:06.165 --> 17:08.242
Totally messed-up fairy tales.

17:09.752 --> 17:12.208
Tell you one thing,
there's no way I'm kissing a damn frog.

17:16.134 --> 17:17.842
Hey, check that out.

17:19.928 --> 17:21.339
Yeah? It's close to Halloween.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.050
You remember Cinderella?

17:25.224 --> 17:30.018
With the pumpkin that turns into a coach
and the mice that become horses?

17:33.067 --> 17:34.976
Dude, could you be more gay?

17:38.614 --> 17:40.108
Don't answer that.

17:51.293 --> 17:54.543
Well, who knows?
Maybe you'll find your fairy godmother.

18:20.239 --> 18:21.318
Help, I'm in here.

18:22.825 --> 18:25.695
Hey, hey. Don't worry, it's okay.
We're here. We got you.

18:25.869 --> 18:27.696
- Help me. She's a lunatic.
- What happened?

18:27.871 --> 18:30.113
My stepmom, she just freaked out,
screamed at me...

18:30.290 --> 18:31.833
...beat me, chained me up.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.408
- Where is she now?
I don't know.

18:34.586 --> 18:36.211
Sam?

19:27.096 --> 19:28.211
Who are you?

19:56.751 --> 19:58.210
Paramedics picked up Cinderella.

19:58.378 --> 19:59.753
- That's good.
Yeah.

19:59.921 --> 20:02.377
So little girl, shiny red apple.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.588
I'm guessing
that means something to you.

20:04.759 --> 20:06.467
I think it's Snow White.

20:06.636 --> 20:08.629
<i>Snow White? Aw, I saw that movie.</i>

20:09.014 --> 20:10.389
Well, the porn version anyways.

20:10.557 --> 20:13.427
There was this wicked stepmother,
phew. She was wicked.

20:13.602 --> 20:15.310
There is a wicked stepmother...

20:15.478 --> 20:18.147
...and she tries to kill Snow White
with a poisoned apple.

20:18.314 --> 20:20.887
- But the apple doesn't kill the girl, right?
- No.

20:21.066 --> 20:22.609
Puts her into a deep sleep.

20:22.776 --> 20:25.065
So deep, it's almost like she's dead.

20:31.035 --> 20:33.870
No, sorry.
We don't have any comatose little girls.

20:34.038 --> 20:35.698
- Are you sure?
- Totally.

20:35.873 --> 20:37.450
It's mostly old guys.

20:37.625 --> 20:40.625
And, well, Callie. She's been around
since before I started here.

20:40.794 --> 20:43.202
- Callie?
- Yeah, it's so sad.

20:43.380 --> 20:45.503
And poor Dr. Garrison,
he just won't give up on her.

20:45.674 --> 20:47.050
Was Callie one of his patients?

20:47.217 --> 20:49.294
No, his daughter.

20:54.475 --> 20:57.262
Ah, here we are.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.971
"'Just press the latch,'
called out the grandmother.

21:02.149 --> 21:04.225
'I'm too weak to get up. '

21:04.401 --> 21:07.236
The wolf pressed the latch
and the door opened.

21:07.404 --> 21:10.690
<i>He stepped inside,
went straight to the grandmother...</i>

21:10.866 --> 21:13.404
<i>...and ate her up. "</i>

21:14.119 --> 21:18.283
Oh. Oh, thank you so much.

21:49.362 --> 21:52.897
" The huntsman stepped
inside and in the bed lay the wolf.

21:53.324 --> 21:55.815
So the huntsman
took a pair of scissors...

21:55.993 --> 21:58.745
...and cut open the wolf's belly. "

22:10.299 --> 22:12.921
Detectives, can I help you?

22:14.053 --> 22:16.129
We just heard that Callie
is your daughter.

22:16.305 --> 22:18.843
And we wanted to say
how very sorry we are.

22:19.892 --> 22:22.218
Well, um, thank you.

22:22.854 --> 22:23.885
If you'll excuse me.

22:24.063 --> 22:27.064
Oh, we're heading this way,
we'll walk with you.

22:27.233 --> 22:29.024
How long has Callie been like that?

22:29.193 --> 22:30.391
We don't mean to intrude.

22:30.570 --> 22:33.736
We can't possibly understand how hard
it must be for you seeing her like this.

22:35.366 --> 22:36.529
Yeah, it's not easy.

22:38.202 --> 22:40.658
She's, uh, been here
since she was 8 years old.

22:40.830 --> 22:44.910
- That's when she was poisoned?
- Yes, swallowed bleach.

22:45.084 --> 22:47.622
Never figure out
how she got her hands on the bottle.

22:48.045 --> 22:51.082
My wife found her,
brought her to the ER.

22:51.257 --> 22:52.585
Here, and I was on call.

22:52.759 --> 22:57.005
Your wife was, uh...?
Was that Callie's stepmother?

23:00.600 --> 23:02.343
Actually, yes. How'd you know that?

23:03.102 --> 23:05.059
Lucky guess.

23:05.563 --> 23:10.189
Well, Julie was the only mother
that, uh, Callie ever knew.

23:10.359 --> 23:13.396
My wife passed away last year
and, uh...

23:13.738 --> 23:15.232
...it's just my daughter and me now.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.068
She's all I got left.

23:19.242 --> 23:21.116
<i>X- ray tech, extension 2407.</i>

23:22.078 --> 23:23.870
Um, excuse me,
I've gotta get back to work.

23:24.039 --> 23:25.663
Yeah.

23:29.836 --> 23:32.292
<i>Well, you're right.
It's Snow White in spades.</i>

23:32.464 --> 23:35.963
Yup. Stepmom poisons the girl,
puts her into a deep sleep.

23:36.134 --> 23:37.712
What's the motive, you think?

23:37.886 --> 23:40.294
Could be like Mischa Barton.

23:40.514 --> 23:43.218
<i>- Sixth Sense, not The O. C.
- What?</i>

23:43.391 --> 23:45.051
Hey, you know fairy tales,
I know movies.

23:45.227 --> 23:46.887
She played the pasty ghost.

23:47.062 --> 23:49.220
You know, remember the mom
had that thing, you know...

23:49.397 --> 23:51.686
...where you keep the kid sick
so you get the attention?

23:51.858 --> 23:52.889
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:53.068 --> 23:55.819
Uh, Münchausen syndrome by proxy.
Huh, could be.

23:55.987 --> 23:58.561
So say all these years,
Callie's been suffering silently...

23:58.740 --> 24:00.982
...because nobody knows the truth
about what Mommy did.

24:01.159 --> 24:03.828
And after all this time,
her spirit just gets angrier...

24:03.995 --> 24:05.905
...until it finally just starts lashing out.

24:06.081 --> 24:08.916
Meanwhile, she has to listen to Dad
tell her these deranged stories...

24:09.084 --> 24:11.207
...about a rabid wolf
or a cannibalistic old lady.

24:11.378 --> 24:14.497
- It's enough to drive anybody nuts.
- Okay, but how are we gonna stop her?

24:14.673 --> 24:17.342
Callie's stuck here.
Her father's keeping her body alive.

24:17.551 --> 24:20.006
- It does make it hard to burn the bones.
- You think?

24:20.178 --> 24:21.589
Coming in.

24:22.222 --> 24:23.846
You got it?

24:28.687 --> 24:30.893
- Hey, what's her status?
- Seventy-two-year-old female.

24:31.064 --> 24:33.140
Sustained multiple lacerations
and puncture wounds.

24:33.316 --> 24:36.436
BP is 80/40 and falling.
Sinus tachycardia.

24:36.611 --> 24:38.070
Is that a bite?

24:38.238 --> 24:40.610
It looks like she was mauled
by a mad dog or maybe a wolf.

24:40.782 --> 24:43.320
What was the last story
Dr. Garrison was reading Callie?

24:43.493 --> 24:45.818
<i>Little Red Riding Hood.</i>

24:52.418 --> 24:53.995
Excuse me.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.249
Was she the only victim?

24:56.964 --> 25:00.048
She was found by the side of the road,
barely alive. Alone.

25:00.217 --> 25:01.592
We need to find her next of kin.

25:04.513 --> 25:06.755
- Uh, she has a granddaughter.
- Do you have an address?

25:08.475 --> 25:10.801
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

25:12.396 --> 25:14.638
You find a way to stop Callie,
all right?

25:14.815 --> 25:16.190
What about you?

25:16.859 --> 25:19.101
I'm gonna go stop the big bad wolf.

25:19.278 --> 25:21.816
Which is the weirdest thing
I've ever said.

25:48.599 --> 25:50.638
- Hey, Grandma.
- Grr.

26:17.085 --> 26:19.753
Dr. Garrison,
I need to speak with you.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.458
- Detective, what can I do for you?
Well, um...

26:23.048 --> 26:26.499
- It's about Callie.
- My daughter? What about her?

26:28.095 --> 26:31.012
- Maybe, could we sit down for a minute?
- No. What about her?

26:31.640 --> 26:33.882
Okay, well, um...

26:35.185 --> 26:37.937
All right, doctor,
this isn't gonna be easy.

26:38.772 --> 26:41.061
What happened to Callie
was not an accident.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.391
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry but it's true.

26:43.568 --> 26:46.320
You have no idea
what happened to my daughter.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.280
There are things you don't know,
doctor...

26:49.449 --> 26:51.821
...about your wife.
- My wife?

26:51.993 --> 26:54.069
Doctor, your wife poisoned Callie.

26:59.084 --> 27:00.993
Why would you say
something so horrible to me?

27:01.169 --> 27:03.126
Because I need your help.

27:03.296 --> 27:05.704
You stay away from me
and from my daughter, you understand?

27:07.425 --> 27:10.462
Doctor, this isn't... Please, if...

27:21.273 --> 27:24.190
- I'm calling security.
- No, I don't have time to do this gently.

27:24.359 --> 27:26.482
If you don't listen,
more people are gonna get hurt.

27:26.653 --> 27:29.405
- Because Callie is going to hurt them.
- What are you talking about?

27:29.573 --> 27:32.443
You're gonna think I'm crazy,
but just understand me.

27:32.617 --> 27:35.191
Your daughter, Callie, is still here.

27:36.079 --> 27:37.408
She's a spirit.

28:00.561 --> 28:02.304
So you've seen her too?

28:21.665 --> 28:23.207
- Are you okay?
- Yeah...

28:41.018 --> 28:42.560
I sensed her.

28:42.728 --> 28:44.056
Callie.

28:44.229 --> 28:45.889
Her presence, her scent.

28:46.065 --> 28:50.394
I even saw her standing
at the foot of my bed, but I never...

28:51.153 --> 28:53.774
...believed it. I thought I was dreaming...
- It wasn't a dream.

28:54.615 --> 28:56.773
She looks like she did
when she was 8.

28:57.493 --> 28:59.035
White dress.

28:59.203 --> 29:00.365
Red ribbon in her hair.

29:02.665 --> 29:04.456
She's been trying to talk to you.

29:06.168 --> 29:08.540
- You're not a cop, are you?
- No.

29:08.712 --> 29:09.791
Then who are you?

29:09.964 --> 29:12.170
Someone who knows
a little about this kind of thing.

29:12.341 --> 29:15.508
But what you said about my wife
poisoning Callie, that...

29:15.719 --> 29:17.426
Sir, Callie told us.

29:17.595 --> 29:19.173
- What?
Not in so many words.

29:19.764 --> 29:22.006
But in her own way...

29:22.558 --> 29:23.756
...she told us.

29:23.935 --> 29:26.390
My wife loved Callie.
So how is that possible?

29:26.562 --> 29:30.311
- I don't know, but it is.
- No. No, I don't believe you.

29:30.483 --> 29:33.270
Look, Callie is killing people.

29:33.444 --> 29:35.733
She's angry, she's desperate...

29:35.905 --> 29:37.898
...because nobody will listen to her.

29:38.074 --> 29:41.028
So you have to listen to her.

29:41.994 --> 29:43.654
Please...

29:43.871 --> 29:45.864
...listen to your daughter.

30:08.855 --> 30:10.563
<i>Callie?</i>

30:10.982 --> 30:12.476
<i>Callie, it's Daddy.</i>

30:13.985 --> 30:15.894
It's me, Daddy.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.863
Is it true?

30:18.030 --> 30:20.272
Did Mommy do that to you?

30:21.909 --> 30:25.444
I know I wasn't listening before,
but I'm listening now.

30:25.621 --> 30:27.413
Daddy's here.

30:27.999 --> 30:30.916
Please, honey.
Is there any way you can tell me?

30:32.879 --> 30:34.539
Doctor.

30:54.691 --> 30:56.019
Is it true?

31:11.333 --> 31:13.788
Oh, I'm so sorry, baby.

31:16.755 --> 31:17.869
But listen to me.

31:18.048 --> 31:20.420
You gotta stop what you're doing,
okay?

31:21.927 --> 31:24.168
You're hurting people.

31:25.722 --> 31:28.343
I know everything now.

31:30.268 --> 31:31.976
I know the truth.

31:34.606 --> 31:37.477
It's time for you to let go.

31:39.236 --> 31:42.023
It's time for me to let you go.

32:16.898 --> 32:19.519
Whoa, stop, stop. Whoa, stop. Whoa.

32:21.652 --> 32:23.941
Oh, where am I? What's going on?

32:53.183 --> 32:54.843
<i>X- ray tech, extension...</i>

32:55.018 --> 32:56.097
The girl's okay?

32:59.105 --> 33:01.679
So it's really over.

33:02.317 --> 33:05.483
Yeah. All thanks to you.

33:06.696 --> 33:09.270
Callie was the most important thing
in my life...

33:10.658 --> 33:12.651
...but I should've let her go
a long time ago.

33:13.870 --> 33:15.068
See you around, doc.

33:16.498 --> 33:18.122
I sure hope not. Heh.

33:24.380 --> 33:26.457
You know what he said?

33:26.633 --> 33:28.127
Some good advice.

33:32.138 --> 33:34.345
Is that what you want me to do,
Dean?

33:35.767 --> 33:37.047
Just let you go?

35:37.803 --> 35:40.425
Well, little Sammy Winchester.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.422
I'm touched.

35:42.975 --> 35:47.436
I mean, your brother's
been to see me twice, but you...

35:47.897 --> 35:49.724
...I never had the pleasure.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.519
What can I do for you, Sam?

35:56.614 --> 35:57.859
You can beg for your life.

35:59.033 --> 36:01.571
We were having
such a nice conversation.

36:01.744 --> 36:03.571
Then you had to go
and ruin the mood.

36:03.746 --> 36:06.415
If I were you, I'd drop the wisecracks
and start acting scared.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.627
It's not my style.

36:14.382 --> 36:16.955
That's not the original Colt.

36:17.468 --> 36:18.927
Where did you get that?

36:23.474 --> 36:26.309
Ruby. Had to be.

36:26.477 --> 36:29.146
She is such a pain in my ass.

36:29.313 --> 36:31.887
She'll get what's coming to her.

36:32.441 --> 36:34.350
- You can count on it.
That's enough.

36:34.527 --> 36:36.484
I came here to make you an offer.

36:36.696 --> 36:38.984
You're gonna make me an offer?

36:39.156 --> 36:40.532
That's adorable.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.025
You can let Dean out of his deal
right now.

36:43.202 --> 36:46.322
He lives, I live, you live.

36:46.497 --> 36:48.239
Everyone goes home happy.

36:48.665 --> 36:49.696
Or...

36:53.128 --> 36:56.413
...you stop breathing. Permanently.

36:59.676 --> 37:00.707
Oh.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.846
All this tough talk.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.972
I have to tell you,
it's not very convincing.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.223
I mean, come on, Sam.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.438
Do you even wanna break the deal?

37:16.609 --> 37:18.732
What do you think?

37:19.737 --> 37:20.852
I don't know.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.152
Aren't you tired
of cleaning up Dean's messes?

37:24.325 --> 37:26.816
Of dealing with
that broken psyche of his?

37:26.995 --> 37:30.743
Aren't you tired of being bossed around
like a snot-nosed little brother?

37:30.915 --> 37:33.620
You're stronger than Dean,
you're better than him.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.750
- Watch your mouth.
- Admit it.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.162
You're here,
going through the motions.

37:38.339 --> 37:41.257
The truth is you'll be a tiny bit relieved
when he's gone.

37:41.426 --> 37:46.633
- Shut up.
- No more desperate, sloppy, needy Dean.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.845
You can finally be free.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.390
I said, shut up.

37:54.689 --> 37:55.720
Huh.

37:58.067 --> 38:01.602
- Doth protest too much if you ask me.
- All right, I've had enough of your crap.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.653
You let Dean out of his deal
right now.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.863
Sorry, sweetheart,
but your brother's an adult.

38:06.743 --> 38:11.120
He made that deal of his own free will.
Fair and square.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.404
It's ironclad.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.242
Every deal can be broken.

38:15.335 --> 38:16.615
Not this one.

38:17.502 --> 38:19.127
Fine, then I'll kill you.

38:19.296 --> 38:22.712
- Lf you're gone, so is the deal.
- Ha, guess again.

38:24.009 --> 38:27.093
- What?
- Sam, I'm just a saleswoman.

38:27.763 --> 38:29.387
I got a boss like everybody.

38:29.556 --> 38:32.261
He holds the contract, not me.

38:32.434 --> 38:33.893
He wants Dean's soul, bad.

38:34.061 --> 38:36.349
And believe me,
he's not gonna let it go.

38:36.521 --> 38:38.479
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

38:38.690 --> 38:41.146
Shoot me, if it'll get you off.

38:41.318 --> 38:42.481
But the deal still holds.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.523
And when Dean's time is up,
he's getting dragged into the pit.

38:45.697 --> 38:47.026
Then who's your boss?

38:47.199 --> 38:49.108
Who holds the contract?

38:50.118 --> 38:51.945
He's not as cuddly as me,
I can tell you that.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.283
Who is it?

38:55.082 --> 38:56.492
I can't tell you.

38:57.417 --> 38:58.746
I'm sorry, Sam...

38:58.919 --> 39:01.588
...but there's no way out of this one.

39:02.339 --> 39:04.296
Not this time.
