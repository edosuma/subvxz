WEBVTT

00:02.295 --> 00:03.546
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.713 --> 00:05.757
I went to see a sergeant
that I know and we did some digging

00:05.924 --> 00:08.510
for any M. Malones
that fit our particulars.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.803
Patrick Malone.

00:10.553 --> 00:13.515
Goes by the nickname, "Matches."

00:14.099 --> 00:16.101
So, you found him.
What do you need me for?

00:16.267 --> 00:17.519
I need you to get me a gun.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.771
So, you're gonna kill him?

00:20.980 --> 00:22.107
I love you.

00:23.358 --> 00:24.818
Kristen? No!

00:28.655 --> 00:31.950
If we can cure a man like
Oswald Cobblepot, we can cure anyone.

00:33.118 --> 00:36.037
Nobody yet has failed to regret
vexing the Penguin,

00:36.371 --> 00:39.290
and you are vexing me!

00:46.631 --> 00:49.175
<i>You don't eat?</i>

00:50.135 --> 00:54.472
What's the matter, <i>Liebchen,</i> you're sick?

00:54.973 --> 00:56.933
So pale you look.

00:58.059 --> 01:01.020
Tell Mama what's wrong.

01:03.648 --> 01:07.152
You don't have to tell. I know.

01:07.318 --> 01:10.905
<i>Life is hard when you're special.</i>

01:11.072 --> 01:13.575
<i>And you are so special.</i>

01:13.742 --> 01:18.037
So clever, so handsome.

01:18.496 --> 01:22.667
<i>When you are older with a stick,</i>

01:22.834 --> 01:25.253
we will beat away the women.

01:25.962 --> 01:28.506
But only if you eat your goulash

01:28.673 --> 01:33.261
so you can grow big and strong.

01:40.935 --> 01:44.898
Matching the Crane formula
to our own enforced REM stimulation

01:45.064 --> 01:47.567
seems to be providing the desired results.

01:47.734 --> 01:49.611
How's his behavior day to day?

01:49.861 --> 01:52.071
Docile. Friendly.

01:52.238 --> 01:53.323
Appetite?

01:53.490 --> 01:54.991
Low, but I'm not concerned.

01:55.200 --> 01:59.788
Hmm, I'm curious to see
how he responds to adverse stimuli.

02:00.872 --> 02:04.709
Let's move on to the ice cream test.

02:27.899 --> 02:30.985
Ice cream. Why do you have ice cream?

02:31.778 --> 02:34.823
I'm sure I don't know.

02:35.573 --> 02:38.535
It's unusual, isn't it?

02:38.910 --> 02:40.578
My name's Oswald, what's yours?

02:40.745 --> 02:44.582
I don't have ice cream.
Why do you have ice cream?

02:45.416 --> 02:46.918
Please, by all means, you can--

02:47.085 --> 02:50.255
I don't have ice cream!

02:50.839 --> 02:53.049
Why do you have ice cream?

02:53.842 --> 02:55.468
I apologize, sir, I don't--

02:55.927 --> 02:57.095
Ah!

02:57.387 --> 02:59.848
Excellent. No violent reaction.

03:00.014 --> 03:03.393
The treatment is working perfectly.
Guards!

03:03.560 --> 03:06.187
<i>Where is my ice cream?
How come you have ice cream?</i>

03:06.354 --> 03:07.605
I want mine.

03:07.772 --> 03:10.024
Where is it? Where is it?

03:10.400 --> 03:15.655
I want ice cream.
What flavor is it? What flavor is it?

03:34.507 --> 03:36.467
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

03:43.516 --> 03:45.184
What? You asked me for it.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.770
- I know.
- If you don't want it--

03:47.937 --> 03:48.938
I want it.

03:49.814 --> 03:51.149
You look scared.

03:53.484 --> 03:54.861
I'm not.

04:00.033 --> 04:02.911
- Is it loaded?
- Ain't no point in an unloaded gun.

04:03.703 --> 04:06.623
Guns aren't for show, Bruce,
and they're not for protection.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.626
They're only for one thing.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.423
Of course.

04:15.965 --> 04:17.425
They're only for one thing.

04:31.564 --> 04:34.609
- Lee, good morning.
- Hey.

04:35.693 --> 04:37.487
Look, what we talked about after Arkham--

04:37.654 --> 04:40.782
It's not why I'm here.
I wanted you to take a look at these.

04:40.949 --> 04:43.159
It's Kristen Kringle's final paychecks.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.411
Her paychecks? How'd you get these?

04:45.954 --> 04:49.207
I went to human resources to get
her new address and they gave them to me.

04:49.582 --> 04:52.210
She never picked them up.
They don't know where she is.

04:52.377 --> 04:54.712
She never cashed them,
never left a forwarding address.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.714
That's odd.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.467
Well, Dougherty has money.
Maybe they're traveling.

05:00.677 --> 05:03.972
I don't like it.
She said that Dougherty hurt her before.

05:04.138 --> 05:07.225
Really? Have you talked to Ed about it?

05:07.392 --> 05:09.018
- No.
- Maybe he's heard from her.

05:09.185 --> 05:11.396
I didn't feel like
it was right to worry him.

05:11.813 --> 05:13.398
I just want to know that she's all right.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.401
I can take it to Missing Persons.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.403
No, no, that's all right.
I'll look into it.

05:20.238 --> 05:21.781
Let you know what I find.

05:22.991 --> 05:24.075
Thank you.

05:24.242 --> 05:25.243
Yeah.

05:41.801 --> 05:44.887
Ah, Master Bruce. You ready?

05:46.055 --> 05:47.056
Yes.

05:48.057 --> 05:49.308
I'm gonna need more than that.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.769
<i>We're on the hunt
of an extremely dangerous man.</i>

05:51.936 --> 05:53.521
<i>This is life and death stuff.</i>

05:53.688 --> 05:57.483
I need you to tell me that you are sure.
Now, are you sure?

06:03.281 --> 06:05.450
Yes, Alfred. I'm sure.

06:05.700 --> 06:08.745
Right. And when we're on the street,

06:08.911 --> 06:11.456
you follow my every lead,
no faffing about, is that understood?

06:12.248 --> 06:14.292
- Yes.
- Good lad.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.337
Our quarry is an east side boy.

06:18.504 --> 06:21.299
This misspent youth,
Patrick Matches Malone,

06:21.466 --> 06:24.135
was arrested several times
with a geezer called Cupcake.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.596
I suspect there's irony at play there.

06:27.263 --> 06:29.307
They're partners in crime
until Matches' testimony

06:29.474 --> 06:33.227
put Mr. Cupcake
in the Blackgate Pen for 10.

06:33.978 --> 06:35.354
Says here that Cupcake is out now,

06:35.521 --> 06:39.108
and he runs this strong-arm
little firm called "The Mutants."

06:41.152 --> 06:43.279
So, I guess we have to start there then.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.031
<i>- Solomon.</i>
<i>- Grundy.</i>

06:46.741 --> 06:48.409
- Solomon.
- Grundy.

06:52.038 --> 06:53.206
Remember. Let me do the talking.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.166
I know how to handle this type, all right?

06:55.333 --> 06:58.628
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Hope we find you well.

07:00.463 --> 07:04.842
We're hoping to have a little chat
with a gentleman called Cupcake.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.763
You found me, sweetheart. What's up?

07:09.180 --> 07:11.599
Mr. Cupcake, pleasure to meet you.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.268
My name's Alfred Pennyworth.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.939
Now, we're on the hunt for a guy
called Matches Malone.

07:18.106 --> 07:19.816
Now, we know
he stitched you up a few years ago,

07:19.982 --> 07:23.194
so I'm sure you wouldn't mind returning
the favor, if you know what I mean.

07:24.112 --> 07:25.404
- Who's your friend?
- Never mind who he is...

07:25.571 --> 07:28.449
- I'm Bruce Wayne.
- Boy billionaire Bruce Wayne?

07:30.326 --> 07:31.494
That one.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.412
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money

07:33.579 --> 07:35.039
if you can tell us where to find Malone.

07:35.206 --> 07:36.707
Oh, really? Why?

07:37.333 --> 07:39.544
- Master Bruce, please let me talk--
- I think he killed my parents.

07:39.877 --> 07:42.171
Oh, that's a good answer.

07:42.380 --> 07:43.714
How much money?

07:44.590 --> 07:47.218
- How much will make you talk?
- $1 million.

07:47.385 --> 07:49.262
Hell yeah.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.597
- That's too much.
- The boy is cheap.

07:52.682 --> 07:54.725
Mr. Cupcake, if I may be so bold as to--

07:54.892 --> 07:57.812
- Yo, I'm talking to the shot caller.
- That's right.

07:57.979 --> 07:59.397
Tell you what, son, I'll make you a deal.

07:59.564 --> 08:02.567
Give me $50,000. You won't get Matches,

08:02.733 --> 08:04.902
but you get to leave here
with your fingers and toes.

08:06.362 --> 08:07.488
Steady on, pal.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.574
I'm just messing with you.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.410
I wouldn't hurt the little boy.
I like little boys.

08:12.577 --> 08:15.872
You on the other hand,
I'm not sure about you.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.749
Tell you what, I'll give you
that rat Matches for 50 grand.

08:18.916 --> 08:23.087
But first, you must fight me.

08:23.588 --> 08:25.798
- I beg your-- Excuse me?
- Fight me, baby.

08:25.965 --> 08:29.427
No, you see, I'm not really a...
I'm not really a fighter.

08:29.594 --> 08:33.598
Oh, shh. I saw you step up just now.
"Steady on, pal."

08:33.764 --> 08:35.433
Mr. Cupcake, I really can't foresee

08:35.600 --> 08:38.519
anything positive
coming out of this altercation.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.814
You're in my house.
Fight is what we do here.

08:41.981 --> 08:43.441
- Yeah.
- That's right.

08:43.649 --> 08:46.652
I'll pay you $100,000
for the name and no fighting.

08:46.819 --> 08:50.281
I'm not about money, little boy.
I'm about respect.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.450
No fight, no deal.

08:52.617 --> 08:55.786
No Matches. No exit.

08:58.623 --> 09:03.002
All right, well, I suppose, you know,
Mr. Cupcake, if you put it like that...

09:10.384 --> 09:12.511
If you wouldn't mind, sir.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.679
Will you be all right?

09:13.971 --> 09:15.806
We'll have to wait and see, won't we?

09:15.973 --> 09:17.642
Are you acting like this is my fault?

09:18.517 --> 09:20.770
- It's not for me to say, is it, sir?
- How is it my fault?

09:20.937 --> 09:22.980
I told you to let me do the talking,
did I not?

09:23.147 --> 09:26.484
And did you do the talking? Yes. I think
you'll find yes, you did do the talking.

09:26.651 --> 09:29.362
To be fair, I think the result
would have been similar in any case.

09:29.528 --> 09:33.157
If, Master Bruce, we are lucky enough
to walk away from this alive,

09:33.950 --> 09:37.787
let this be a lesson to you.
And another thing, pick your battles.

09:38.079 --> 09:39.830
Don't let them pick you.

09:40.289 --> 09:45.836
Right. On your honor, I win, we walk.

09:46.045 --> 09:50.174
Sure thing, mister. On my honor.
They'll understand.

09:50.341 --> 09:54.053
But the fight doesn't stop till somebody
says "uncle," or goes to sleep.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.763
Now, get it on.

09:56.806 --> 09:59.475
The other thing, of course, Master Bruce,
to remember,

09:59.850 --> 10:02.103
is that timing is everything.

10:15.408 --> 10:19.370
See, there's other factors at play here,
Master Bruce. There's footwork. Leverage--

10:19.537 --> 10:21.038
Stop talking.

10:29.422 --> 10:31.173
What? What, you want some?

10:40.182 --> 10:41.350
Alfred!

10:46.689 --> 10:48.065
Uncle! Uncle!

10:48.232 --> 10:51.819
No! He's slowing.

11:02.246 --> 11:06.083
See, Master Bruce.
Big muscles require lots of blood.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.421
Strength costs wind.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.632
Now, if you gotta beat a big man,
all you have to do

11:14.342 --> 11:15.676
is outlast him.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.803
No. No.

11:18.763 --> 11:19.847
Uncle, uncle.

11:20.431 --> 11:22.767
I'm calling it, the butler wins.

11:25.019 --> 11:28.606
- Are you okay?
- I'm absolutely flipping peachy, mate.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.652
You're a tough old cat.

11:34.195 --> 11:37.531
Not too shabby yourself, Mr. Cupcake.
Matches?

11:37.907 --> 11:40.951
- Fifty grand.
- Will, will a check be all right?

11:43.537 --> 11:46.957
Yeah, yeah, sure, a check will be fine.
Make it out to cash.

11:47.124 --> 11:50.169
Go see Jeri down at Celestial Garden,
it's on the east side.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.047
She'll know where to find Matches.

11:53.214 --> 11:56.008
Pleasure doing business with you,
Mr. Cupcake.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.517
How do you feel?

12:05.017 --> 12:07.144
A couple of hours kip,
and I'll come up lovely.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.522
Good.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.315
You stay here.

12:12.191 --> 12:16.779
You ain't going nowhere
till I'm up and about, all right?

12:19.031 --> 12:20.366
Yes. I hear you.

12:21.951 --> 12:23.953
Promise me, Master B.

12:25.204 --> 12:26.247
Say again?

12:39.510 --> 12:40.719
Sorry.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.229
- Blood.
- Life.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.606
Throat.

12:52.773 --> 12:53.858
Song.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.693
- Cat.
- Kitten.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.945
- Mother.
- Hug.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.905
- Crime.
- Punishment.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.365
Revenge.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.117
Remorse.

13:03.284 --> 13:05.828
Ah, remorse. Let's talk about that.

13:07.079 --> 13:09.123
I feel it. A lot.

13:09.290 --> 13:13.878
Remorse is progress. Remorse is huge.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.213
Is it?

13:16.380 --> 13:21.177
I feel terrible about stuff.
I was so mean to people.

13:21.343 --> 13:25.097
Remorse is a healthy and natural response
of the human condition.

13:25.264 --> 13:29.768
It is a good sign. It is a normal sign.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.313
I want to be normal.

13:32.897 --> 13:34.356
I want to be good.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.820
You must think I'm lying to you.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.447
Oh, no.

13:43.324 --> 13:45.409
I can tell when someone's lying to me.

13:46.327 --> 13:50.706
Oswald, you are making
a magnificent transformation.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.875
Your real self is emerging.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.794
<i>A kind, decent, young man.</i>

13:56.253 --> 13:59.256
Just a few more therapy sessions
and you'll be right as rain.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.802
More therapy?

14:03.969 --> 14:05.429
Oh, just a little.

14:05.596 --> 14:08.265
I know there's a discomfort factor,

14:08.432 --> 14:13.437
but after all,
it is making you better, yes?

14:14.438 --> 14:17.691
Oh, you do want to get better,

14:19.401 --> 14:20.486
don't you?

14:22.780 --> 14:24.490
Yes, Professor Strange.

14:25.074 --> 14:28.327
Oswald, please. Call me Hugo.

14:30.412 --> 14:31.872
Yes, Hugo.

14:40.506 --> 14:41.674
Hey, Ed. You busy?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.134
I'm studying the decomp rate
of various colors of ink

14:44.301 --> 14:46.971
to see if we can use tattoos
to help determine time of death.

14:47.179 --> 14:49.306
Hmm, is that a yes or a no?

14:50.641 --> 14:52.810
Please come in. How can I help you?

14:54.812 --> 14:58.315
I was wondering if you'd heard
from Kristen Kringle lately.

15:00.985 --> 15:04.405
I'm strong as a rock,
but a word can destroy me. What am I?

15:06.949 --> 15:08.534
Silence. I've heard nothing.

15:09.535 --> 15:11.203
Well, I don't want to alarm you,

15:11.370 --> 15:13.831
but we can't seem to locate her.

15:14.373 --> 15:16.834
She hasn't cashed her last few paychecks.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.336
Oh, my Lord. Do you...

15:20.212 --> 15:22.339
Do you think
that something bad has happened?

15:22.631 --> 15:24.883
No. No, no. We're not there yet, anyway.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.218
We? Who is we?

15:26.385 --> 15:29.138
Oh, just me and my curiosity.

15:29.305 --> 15:32.141
I don't know Tom Dougherty well.
What is he like?

15:32.516 --> 15:35.185
What is Tom Dougherty like?

15:35.769 --> 15:37.438
Rotten.

15:37.688 --> 15:39.773
Hmm, that's what I'd heard.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.736
And Kringle told you herself
that she was moving south with Dougherty?

15:43.902 --> 15:46.113
Not in person. She left a note.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.865
Can I take a look at it?

15:48.866 --> 15:51.243
I didn't really think of it as a keepsake.

15:55.497 --> 15:58.959
Right. Yeah, excuse me.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.463
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:03.714 --> 16:07.843
Again? Yeah, okay. I'm on my way.

16:09.595 --> 16:12.473
So, that's the game, is it, Jimbo?

16:13.557 --> 16:16.018
Gonna try to outsmart me?

16:16.185 --> 16:18.228
Play me for a fool?

16:20.022 --> 16:21.523
I don't think so.

16:25.736 --> 16:27.071
Well, that took you long enough.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.448
For a butler,
you sure do get beat up a lot.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.658
What happened?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.076
We got his name, Jim.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.453
The name of the man
that killed Bruce's parents.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.413
Matches Malone.

16:36.872 --> 16:38.582
Dude, we're the cops.

16:38.749 --> 16:41.669
Thank you for sharing this with us.
When were you gonna tell us?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.962
I haven't got time to explain now.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.881
We got a good solid lead
from the same place

16:46.048 --> 16:47.841
that I got seven bells knocked out of me.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.301
Now Bruce, he won't answer his phone.

16:49.468 --> 16:52.429
So, my guess is
he's gone after this Malone.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.098
Solo.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.308
Going after him? To do what exactly?

16:56.475 --> 16:57.768
What can he do? He's a kid.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.269
<i>Only reason to go alone.</i>

16:59.812 --> 17:01.230
He's gonna kill the man.

17:02.648 --> 17:05.401
<i>I mean, I, I told him not to.
I said you're too young for killing.</i>

17:05.567 --> 17:06.735
Said I'd do it for him.

17:06.902 --> 17:10.239
Again. We're the cops.
Do not tell us stuff like this.

17:10.406 --> 17:12.950
You've got to understand. Both of ya.

17:15.369 --> 17:16.495
This is not a game.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.622
I understand.

17:19.498 --> 17:20.874
Tell me where he is.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.712
Hey, cowboy.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.756
Yes, sir?

17:29.466 --> 17:30.634
Have fun.

18:16.847 --> 18:20.142
Ha! Hello, Bruce. What took you so long?

18:22.227 --> 18:23.479
I'm looking for Jeri.

18:23.645 --> 18:24.980
Yeah, you are.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.691
Follow me.

18:45.793 --> 18:47.127
Come.

19:15.906 --> 19:18.700
Come.

19:21.036 --> 19:22.412
Take a pew.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.916
Iced tea? Soda?

19:26.500 --> 19:28.252
No, thank you.

19:29.795 --> 19:30.796
You like the show?

19:31.380 --> 19:32.673
I liked it.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.758
Are you Jeri?

19:34.925 --> 19:36.426
Some people call me that.

19:44.977 --> 19:47.062
What? What can I do for you?

19:47.229 --> 19:48.230
Oh...

19:49.273 --> 19:52.025
Sorry. You know my name,
so Cupcake called you.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.444
I assumed you already know why I'm here.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.947
I just want you to say it.

19:57.948 --> 19:59.700
I'm looking for Matches Malone.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.326
Why?

20:02.578 --> 20:03.954
He killed my parents.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.457
What you gonna do if you find him?

20:08.667 --> 20:10.127
Ask him some questions.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.132
Kill him.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.636
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.473
Killing people isn't, you know, that easy.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.269
Hey, maybe you've killed people before.
You've killed people before, blood?

20:27.477 --> 20:28.812
No.

20:30.522 --> 20:32.316
But no one's killed my parents before.

20:35.152 --> 20:38.071
Well, Matches has killed dozens of people.

20:39.698 --> 20:42.159
<i>Men, women, children.</i>

20:43.869 --> 20:45.495
He's a professional.

20:46.455 --> 20:49.082
And what exactly are you?

20:51.877 --> 20:53.003
Do you know where he is?

20:53.211 --> 20:55.339
Of course I know where he is,
he's a friend of mine.

20:55.505 --> 20:58.508
You gonna give me a good reason
to tell you where he is?

21:00.177 --> 21:02.596
- Justice.
- Please.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.515
- Money.
- No. I don't care about money.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.142
Try something else.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.813
I have a gun.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.149
That's a good reason.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.110
Please.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.112
Tell me where he is.

21:20.364 --> 21:23.367
Come on, kid,
you ain't even pointing at me!

21:27.371 --> 21:29.164
What is your problem?

21:30.207 --> 21:32.042
I've been told it's unwise
to point a gun at someone

21:32.209 --> 21:33.752
if you're not ready to shoot them.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.045
And I'm not.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.381
Very wise young man.

21:46.598 --> 21:47.766
Thank you, Jeri.

21:49.017 --> 21:53.397
It's been interesting talking to you.

21:58.276 --> 22:02.739
Matches lives in that big building
on Grand Street, between 9th and 10th.

22:03.865 --> 22:05.242
Apartment 9B.

22:09.079 --> 22:10.664
Why did you tell me that?

22:13.458 --> 22:14.918
I thought he was your friend.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.086
He is.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.338
Well, he was.

22:20.215 --> 22:22.467
Matches is gonna be happy to see you.

22:23.093 --> 22:26.179
<i>You, my boy,
are the childish hand of fate.</i>

22:27.597 --> 22:30.058
Well, that makes me God,
in a way, doesn't it?

22:34.438 --> 22:36.773
And who doesn't like to play God?

23:03.216 --> 23:04.301
Bruce.

23:06.261 --> 23:07.637
Bruce! Hey.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.182
Please let me go.

23:10.474 --> 23:12.809
Bruce, listen to me.
I know what you're doing.

23:12.976 --> 23:14.644
Alfred told me everything.

23:15.312 --> 23:16.438
He shouldn't have done that.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.315
I understand how you feel.

23:18.482 --> 23:19.566
No, you don't.

23:19.775 --> 23:22.486
No, you're right, I don't.
And it doesn't matter.

23:22.694 --> 23:24.613
This is as far as you go.

23:24.780 --> 23:25.864
You're gonna take over from here, are you?

23:26.031 --> 23:27.199
Yes, I am.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.659
I'm sorry, Detective Gordon,
that doesn't reassure me.

23:29.826 --> 23:32.037
Bruce, I can't let you do this.

23:33.163 --> 23:36.208
GCPD. One, two, three, four...

23:42.005 --> 23:43.006
Hey!

25:13.513 --> 25:15.015
Matches Malone?

25:15.932 --> 25:16.933
Mmm-hmm.

25:22.939 --> 25:24.274
I want to hire you.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.819
Kids now.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.534
So you want to hire me?

25:35.410 --> 25:36.661
I want someone to die.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.830
Wait a while. They will.

25:39.623 --> 25:40.957
I don't wanna wait.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.793
You're kind of young
to be putting out contracts.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.212
I'm old enough.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.508
Are you a proficient killer?

25:51.259 --> 25:52.761
I thought you wanted to hire me.

25:52.928 --> 25:55.305
You didn't say nothing
about a job interview.

25:56.473 --> 25:57.933
I have to be sure
I'm getting the right man.

25:58.099 --> 25:59.935
Don't you know a killer when you see one?

26:00.101 --> 26:01.519
Actually, you look very ordinary.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.689
Have you killed a lot of people?

26:05.148 --> 26:07.651
I've killed all kind of folks

26:07.817 --> 26:09.778
just about every way you can.

26:10.654 --> 26:13.740
Rich, poor, guilty, innocent.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.743
By hand, by blade, by gun.

26:18.203 --> 26:21.998
Burn just one guy to death, they call you
Matches the rest of your days.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.501
Life's funny, isn't it?

26:28.380 --> 26:29.506
Cat got your tongue?

26:32.259 --> 26:34.177
What's the matter, kid? You sick?

26:36.137 --> 26:38.974
Sorry, I'm fine.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.809
Nervous is all.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.605
You seem to be the right man.

26:46.856 --> 26:49.359
Damn right, I am.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.531
Where is Bruce Wayne?

26:54.698 --> 26:56.533
You are so angry.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.785
I'm sensing a personal relationship.

26:58.952 --> 27:01.496
Maybe like a surrogate father
type of thing.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.832
- Where is he?
- He is...

27:04.207 --> 27:05.625
He's a really good kid.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.545
He's got steel in him.

27:08.712 --> 27:10.588
He's gonna grow up
and be a strong man one day.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.382
Well, if he lives long enough.

27:13.049 --> 27:16.594
This is gonna go a lot better for you
if you don't make me angry.

27:17.220 --> 27:21.016
Angry is your natural state, isn't it?
You are the infamous Jim Gordon.

27:21.725 --> 27:23.226
Everybody knows about your temper.

27:23.393 --> 27:26.563
This isn't about me.
There's a kid out there in danger.

27:26.730 --> 27:29.190
Oh, there's lots of kids
out there in danger.

27:30.358 --> 27:34.404
Why does this poor, little, rich boy
got your special attention?

27:35.071 --> 27:36.239
You're trying to make me angry.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.993
Do you want me to hurt you?

27:41.202 --> 27:43.371
Could you? I got nowhere else to be.

27:43.538 --> 27:44.706
No.

27:45.415 --> 27:47.625
Tell me where you sent Bruce Wayne. Now.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.879
You are a lot less fun than advertised.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.716
What time is it?

27:55.842 --> 27:57.302
<i>What time is it?</i>

27:58.720 --> 28:00.430
Yep, he should be there by now.

28:00.972 --> 28:04.017
So you could get there
just in time for the cleanup.

28:11.232 --> 28:15.362
Price starts at 10 grand or so
for a simple hit on an adult male vic,

28:15.528 --> 28:18.782
then there's a sliding scale
depending on how hard the job is.

28:19.532 --> 28:22.660
I charge double for women,
and triple for kids.

28:23.161 --> 28:25.955
No babies. I won't kill babies.

28:27.499 --> 28:28.833
Ten grand.

28:30.085 --> 28:31.294
That's cheap.

28:31.961 --> 28:33.338
Low overhead.

28:34.798 --> 28:36.216
Who do you want dead, son?

28:41.763 --> 28:43.890
You really don't remember me, do you?

28:44.516 --> 28:46.142
Remember you?

28:46.851 --> 28:49.646
No. We've met before?

28:51.314 --> 28:53.983
Yes, we've met before.

29:00.698 --> 29:02.409
You killed my parents.

29:03.701 --> 29:04.869
Oh...

29:14.170 --> 29:15.755
Keep your hands where I can see them.

29:17.841 --> 29:19.717
Relax, kid. I won't jump you.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.679
I could if I wanted to, but...

29:24.472 --> 29:25.640
I'm too tired.

29:27.434 --> 29:28.810
Who are you now?

29:30.311 --> 29:31.604
My name is Bruce Wayne.

29:33.106 --> 29:35.024
When was this we met before?

29:35.400 --> 29:36.776
Two years ago.

29:37.569 --> 29:38.862
An alley in the theater district.

29:39.028 --> 29:42.615
You killed my mother and father,
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.367
I was there.

29:47.245 --> 29:48.705
Rings a bell.

29:50.915 --> 29:52.417
You looked right at me.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.461
I was busy that year.

29:58.423 --> 30:00.258
My parents were important people.

30:02.385 --> 30:04.596
It was a big deal in all the newspapers.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.557
I don't read the papers much.
Don't watch TV.

30:07.765 --> 30:09.392
It's always the same bad news.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.063
You really don't remember?

30:14.230 --> 30:17.192
Oh, hey, some of 'em stick with you.

30:17.609 --> 30:20.862
There was this mustached fella,
he was a big fat crybaby,

30:22.071 --> 30:24.574
comes back to me in my dreams
all the time,

30:25.617 --> 30:27.368
like he's important.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.872
I can't even recall his name.

30:31.539 --> 30:33.833
<i>Did I stab him? Toss him off a roof?</i>

30:35.376 --> 30:36.669
I don't know.

30:37.128 --> 30:39.631
My parents were in evening clothes.

30:40.757 --> 30:41.883
It was cold and wet.

30:47.138 --> 30:49.390
You grabbed my mother's pearl necklace,
it broke.

30:52.101 --> 30:53.394
Oh...

30:56.481 --> 30:57.982
Oh, yeah.

31:00.193 --> 31:02.195
And the beads went everywhere.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.280
<i>Coming back to me now.</i>

31:06.282 --> 31:11.120
Nice looking blonde lady,
silver fox type dude, and a kid.

31:13.623 --> 31:14.999
That was you?

31:16.292 --> 31:17.627
That was me.

31:19.254 --> 31:20.588
Who hired you?

31:20.755 --> 31:22.173
Maybe nobody did.

31:23.132 --> 31:24.676
Maybe I just saw some rich suckers.

31:25.677 --> 31:28.263
Somebody like that
walks into a dark alley,

31:28.471 --> 31:30.223
they deserved it
'cause they let it happen.

31:31.641 --> 31:33.268
That's the way of the world,
isn't it, son?

31:33.434 --> 31:34.519
Don't call me son.

31:34.686 --> 31:37.981
Why? If I did what you think I did,
then I made you what you are.

31:39.399 --> 31:40.817
Just like Gotham made me.

31:42.402 --> 31:45.321
<i>Just like the rich folks
like your parents made Gotham.</i>

31:47.824 --> 31:49.784
I might as well call you son.

31:51.244 --> 31:53.413
I can make you tell me who hired you.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.624
You think so?

31:56.791 --> 31:58.167
I could hurt you.

31:59.502 --> 32:00.962
I can shoot you in the knee.

32:03.131 --> 32:04.757
Or the stomach.

32:04.924 --> 32:07.343
But you can't make me
tell you a damn thing.

32:09.512 --> 32:11.931
Killer's code ain't much,
but it's what I've got.

32:14.517 --> 32:17.520
If I did what you say I did
and someone hired me to do it,

32:18.271 --> 32:19.814
you'll never know their name.

32:20.189 --> 32:23.526
<i>Not if you take me apart piece by piece.</i>

32:23.860 --> 32:25.528
You better believe that.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.032
Well, then I guess
there's nothing left to say.

32:34.454 --> 32:36.039
Here's to you, son.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.710
You've been a long time coming.

32:42.170 --> 32:43.504
You want me to kill you?

32:45.340 --> 32:46.716
Why?

32:50.011 --> 32:52.472
Little rich kid like you
wouldn't understand.

32:54.223 --> 32:55.725
Try me.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.897
A man gets tired.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.986
Doing wrong and going unpunished.

33:08.655 --> 33:10.031
<i>Nothing happens.</i>

33:13.660 --> 33:16.996
You start to wonder if there is a God.

33:26.547 --> 33:27.757
Tighten your left hand grip.

33:29.509 --> 33:31.761
<i>Aim right here,</i>

33:32.887 --> 33:35.264
a little low. She'll kick.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.482
Come on. Pull the damn trigger.

33:47.110 --> 33:48.277
No.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.363
Don't lose your nerve now. Do it!

33:51.948 --> 33:53.616
Look at me.

33:56.369 --> 33:58.162
I'm a monster.

34:01.457 --> 34:02.875
You need to kill me.

34:05.628 --> 34:07.380
I wish you were a monster.

34:11.801 --> 34:13.428
But you're just a man.

34:23.312 --> 34:24.313
Bruce.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.315
He's in there.

34:54.552 --> 34:55.887
- Good luck, buddy.
- Huh.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.097
Hey. Hey.

34:59.307 --> 35:00.516
Hey!

35:00.683 --> 35:02.852
I think there's been a mistake.

35:24.582 --> 35:26.501
- Just wait.
- Hey.

35:27.084 --> 35:28.211
Who's there?

35:35.468 --> 35:37.720
No. Remember me?

35:37.970 --> 35:39.806
I'm the man with the ice cream.

35:40.014 --> 35:42.141
Oh, yeah.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.269
Yeah.
You knocked me around pretty good.

35:46.354 --> 35:48.439
I guess that ice cream
must be delicious, huh?

35:48.606 --> 35:49.899
It was pretty good.

35:51.943 --> 35:53.569
You look kind of uncomfortable.

35:56.364 --> 35:58.616
I have a sharp knife here.

35:59.742 --> 36:01.035
What say I help you out?

36:01.786 --> 36:03.120
Help me out?

36:03.579 --> 36:06.415
You have to promise to be nice, okay?

36:06.791 --> 36:10.545
There's no ice cream in here,
so there's no reason to get mad. Okay?

36:10.878 --> 36:11.879
Promise?

36:12.046 --> 36:13.130
Okay.

36:23.724 --> 36:25.601
<i>- There you go.
- Thank you.</i>

36:26.561 --> 36:27.770
Oh, you're welcome.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.150
<i>Bravo, Cobblepot.</i>

36:33.901 --> 36:35.111
Sir?

36:36.612 --> 36:40.491
This is an official certificate from
the Gotham Board of Health and Hygiene.

36:40.658 --> 36:44.912
It states that Oswald Cobblepot
has passed all mandated tests,

36:45.079 --> 36:49.667
and by the laws of Gotham City
is hereby declared

36:49.834 --> 36:51.127
sane.

36:55.673 --> 36:56.841
I'm sane?

36:57.008 --> 37:01.012
You're as sane and normal
as any other citizen.

37:01.554 --> 37:03.681
Ms. Peabody even.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.350
<i>Do you know what that means?</i>

37:07.226 --> 37:08.686
No more therapy?

37:08.853 --> 37:12.023
Oswald, you're a free man.

37:12.690 --> 37:13.900
I don't follow you.

37:14.066 --> 37:16.903
You are sane,
ergo there is no reason for you

37:17.069 --> 37:19.363
to be in a mental health institution.

37:19.530 --> 37:21.949
You are free to go.

37:22.366 --> 37:23.910
I'm fine right here.

37:24.076 --> 37:29.290
Oswald, Oswald, Oswald,
you are just feeling anxious about change.

37:29.457 --> 37:32.960
That is totally normal, to feel that way
upon release from care.

37:33.961 --> 37:36.964
Okay. I guess if it's normal...

37:37.340 --> 37:41.802
You are a sane, gentle, good man.

37:41.969 --> 37:44.597
And good things happen to good people.

37:45.389 --> 37:46.474
They do?

37:47.350 --> 37:49.393
I've never heard that before.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.980
A true thing. Trust me.

37:53.940 --> 37:56.651
Well, you've been right so far.

37:57.485 --> 37:59.528
Thank you, Professor Strange-- Hugo...

38:00.988 --> 38:04.867
...for being such a kind mentor
and friend.

38:05.660 --> 38:07.995
That's very touching, Oswald.

38:08.955 --> 38:10.706
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

38:10.873 --> 38:13.042
And now,
why don't you go back to your room

38:13.209 --> 38:15.378
and get your belongings together.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.380
Okay.

38:28.724 --> 38:31.060
Are you sure about that? Letting him go?

38:31.227 --> 38:32.937
Not really. He's an experiment.

38:33.104 --> 38:35.773
He's a notorious criminal.
There'll be an outcry.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.316
The outcry will pass.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.735
People are afraid of progress,
Ms. Peabody,

38:39.902 --> 38:42.113
and yet somehow we keep progressing.

38:42.279 --> 38:44.949
I hope you'll at least alert the police
he's been released.

38:45.116 --> 38:47.284
Enough input, Ms. Peabody.

38:47.451 --> 38:50.746
I have other reasons,
deeper plans for Cobblepot

38:50.913 --> 38:52.581
that you can't know about now.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.750
For your own safety.

38:55.251 --> 38:57.086
Deeper plans?

39:00.006 --> 39:03.175
Deeper than building semi-human creatures
in the basement?

39:04.385 --> 39:07.513
I'm sure I don't want to know,
thank you very much.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.432
On your head be it.

39:31.996 --> 39:34.790
There's a reason why
we might've missed Malone, okay?

39:34.957 --> 39:37.043
His record goes back
to nursery school on up.

39:37.209 --> 39:40.963
Assault, robbery, battery, couple of hits
for the mob. But this is way, way back.

39:41.130 --> 39:42.381
Last few years, nothing.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.967
That's why his name
never came up as a potential suspect.

39:45.134 --> 39:47.303
Oh, flying under the radar, I guess.
It happens.

39:47.470 --> 39:48.721
Guess we'll never know
if he really did it.

39:48.888 --> 39:51.640
Ah, the boy says he confessed.
That's good enough for me.

39:52.933 --> 39:54.977
Malone killed the Waynes.

39:55.144 --> 39:57.229
The question is,
who paid him to kill the Waynes?

39:57.396 --> 39:59.482
It's a question
I no longer care to ponder.

40:02.651 --> 40:04.445
Hey, Ed. How you doing?

40:04.612 --> 40:07.656
Oh, getting along just fine. Keeping busy.

40:08.491 --> 40:09.825
Any news on the Kringle front?

40:10.409 --> 40:13.370
Uh, no. Damn.
Sorry, I've been a little busy.

40:13.662 --> 40:15.247
I'll get into it, don't worry.

40:15.748 --> 40:17.249
Me, worry?

40:17.917 --> 40:20.169
Yeah. I'll let you know
as soon as I know anything.

40:21.128 --> 40:23.881
- Detective Gordon, do you have a second?
- Uh, yeah.

40:25.966 --> 40:30.513
You'll let me know? I bet you will.

40:30.679 --> 40:34.350
Acting like you forgot all about
Kristen Kringle. Sure you forgot.

40:34.517 --> 40:36.685
- You're ready.
- Thanks, Detective.

40:36.852 --> 40:38.395
<i>You suspect me somehow.
That must be it.</i>

40:39.313 --> 40:42.483
You're trying to lull me
into a false sense of security

40:42.650 --> 40:45.194
while the claws of your investigation
close around me, eh?

40:45.361 --> 40:46.737
Is that it, my little man?

40:46.904 --> 40:48.656
You take me to be a fool?

40:49.156 --> 40:51.867
<i>We'll see about your clever little plan,
Jim Gordon. We'll see.</i>

40:53.494 --> 40:56.080
I can make plans of my own.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.043
<i>Master Bruce.</i>

41:12.513 --> 41:14.765
<i>Alfred,
I have left home for a while</i>

41:14.974 --> 41:16.809
<i>to live on the streets with Selina.</i>

41:16.976 --> 41:20.563
<i>Please. Wait and listen before you react.</i>

41:20.729 --> 41:23.899
<i>You need not worry that I'm in danger,
or that I've lost my mind.</i>

41:25.734 --> 41:27.903
<i>I've thought long and hard
about this decision.</i>

41:28.070 --> 41:29.864
<i>And I know it's the right one.</i>

41:30.030 --> 41:32.700
<i>Malone's death made me realize
a couple of things.</i>

41:33.325 --> 41:37.746
<i>You can't kill murder.
You can't get revenge on evil.</i>

41:37.913 --> 41:41.250
<i>You can only begin to fight such things
by not doing them.</i>

41:41.417 --> 41:43.210
<i>And you can only fight them
where they live.</i>

41:43.377 --> 41:47.965
<i>Not just at Wayne Enterprises.
In the streets, in the slums,</i>

41:48.132 --> 41:49.800
<i>in the bad parts of town.</i>

41:50.634 --> 41:52.595
<i>So that's where I'm going.</i>

41:52.845 --> 41:55.264
He's lost his mind.

41:55.431 --> 41:58.058
<i>I'm not going to start
battling muggers or anything.</i>

41:58.225 --> 42:02.354
<i>But one day I am going to do something
to help the people of Gotham.</i>

42:02.521 --> 42:03.814
<i>I don't know what yet.</i>

42:05.065 --> 42:06.525
<i>But I will.</i>

42:06.692 --> 42:08.777
<i>Meantime, I need to learn stuff.</i>

42:08.944 --> 42:10.487
<i>Number one, I need to learn how to live</i>

42:10.654 --> 42:12.698
<i>in the same world
other people have to live in.</i>

42:12.990 --> 42:16.827
<i>Selina is giving me a place to sleep
and will show me the ropes,</i>

42:18.454 --> 42:20.623
<i>so like I say, there's no need to worry.</i>

42:21.624 --> 42:25.252
<i>I'll be in touch soon,
and I'll come home eventually.</i>

42:26.212 --> 42:31.091
<i>Please, Alfred, trust me,
and honor my wishes.</i>

42:31.258 --> 42:33.219
<i>Don't try to bring me back.</i>

42:33.385 --> 42:35.804
<i>I need to do this.</i>

42:35.971 --> 42:39.058
<i>Sincerely, your good friend,</i>

42:40.309 --> 42:41.310
<i>Bruce.</i>
