00:10.352 --> 00:12.120
I'm meteorologist Mike Mitchell

00:12.155 --> 00:14.889
with another sun-filled
day in the southland.

00:14.923 --> 00:18.159
Basin temperatures ranging
from upper 70s at the beaches,

00:18.193 --> 00:20.360
civic center low 80s, and the inland empire

00:20.395 --> 00:22.763
will see highs up there around 90 or so.

00:22.798 --> 00:24.431
High deserts and desert locations

00:24.465 --> 00:26.834
cracking the century mark, like in Phoenix.

00:26.868 --> 00:28.635
Salt Lake City... another hot day.

00:28.670 --> 00:30.536
Seattle will be comfy in the mid-70s

00:30.571 --> 00:32.470
up there in the Pacific northwest.

00:32.506 --> 00:34.540
And that will be the trend all week.

00:34.575 --> 00:36.710
More of the same except for by Wednesday,

00:36.744 --> 00:40.013
there may be some storms down
in the front range of Denver.

00:40.047 --> 00:42.148
But that front's moving pretty rapidly

00:42.183 --> 00:44.483
and not expected to deposit much rain.

02:01.493 --> 02:04.065
Hey, hey. It's chow time.

02:07.299 --> 02:09.232
How you feeling?

02:09.267 --> 02:11.033
Oh, man.

02:11.561 --> 02:13.404
I'm feeling robust.

02:13.449 --> 02:14.427
Good. You get some sleep?

02:14.461 --> 02:15.672
10 hours.

02:15.723 --> 02:16.554
All right, good.

02:16.573 --> 02:18.164
You'll be able to take a nap later, too.

02:18.414 --> 02:19.483
This is excellent.

02:19.522 --> 02:20.669
It's good shit, right?

02:21.369 --> 02:23.370
What time do we have to be at the arena?

02:23.404 --> 02:25.638
Uh, 4:00, if you want
to do the walk-through.

02:25.672 --> 02:26.873
Roger that.

02:26.907 --> 02:27.745
Second fight up.

02:27.771 --> 02:28.955
Bam. Mm.

02:29.075 --> 02:30.228
You want some eggs?

02:30.348 --> 02:32.545
Mm-hmm. But we don't have any.

02:32.579 --> 02:34.213
I went to the store.

02:34.247 --> 02:35.548
Who loves you?

02:38.351 --> 02:41.210
Um... did you hear anything from dad?

02:42.088 --> 02:43.755
Nope.

02:49.329 --> 02:50.896
You've got to eat something.

02:50.931 --> 02:52.364
I am eating.

02:52.399 --> 02:54.699
I... I'll, um... eat some
more after the shakeout.

02:54.734 --> 02:56.958
If you want something else, I
can go and get you something.

02:56.982 --> 02:58.037
No, no, this is great. Thanks.

02:58.071 --> 02:59.745
It's, uh...

03:01.741 --> 03:03.508
You talk to Alvey?

03:03.543 --> 03:05.577
Mm-hmm. Last night.

03:06.704 --> 03:08.308
Anything I need to know?

03:10.196 --> 03:13.485
You know, Ryan, you had a great camp.

03:13.519 --> 03:15.356
If Alvey shows or he doesn't show up,

03:15.372 --> 03:17.553
it doesn't matter. You got this.

03:17.673 --> 03:19.424
I... I don't feel ready. I mean,

03:19.458 --> 03:21.908
I feel like there's something missing...

03:21.918 --> 03:24.713
like... five years off?

03:24.743 --> 03:26.345
Like, I... I... I'm way behind.

03:26.377 --> 03:27.511
I shouldn't have even taken this fight.

03:27.528 --> 03:29.157
And I told Alvey from the beginning

03:29.205 --> 03:30.963
it's not in me. So...

03:31.401 --> 03:33.734
I don't even know why I'm doing this.

03:35.605 --> 03:37.608
I can tell you if you want me to.

03:39.769 --> 03:41.349
Yeah, please. Go ahead. Tell me.

03:41.394 --> 03:42.761
Tell me why I fight.

03:42.881 --> 03:45.989
You're like a mouse in a maze.

03:48.365 --> 03:50.487
One of those little white
ones with the red eyes...

03:50.526 --> 03:51.888
Freaky eyes.

03:53.624 --> 03:57.442
You need some sort of prize
or some goal at the end...

03:57.934 --> 04:00.592
some girl you want to fuck,
some guy you want to fuck off,

04:00.611 --> 04:01.836
and now you have both.

04:04.735 --> 04:07.183
That's why you fight.

04:09.907 --> 04:12.348
Now finish your oatmeal.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.416
Uh, just a minute.

04:22.437 --> 04:24.452
- Can I get in there, honey?
- Hold on.

04:24.482 --> 04:27.362
- I have to pee like crazy.
- Just a second.

04:34.531 --> 04:36.298
Good morning.

04:38.635 --> 04:40.365
Good morning to you.

04:40.970 --> 04:42.734
You slept in late.

04:43.305 --> 04:45.273
I've been awake for a while.

04:45.307 --> 04:46.826
Just laying there.

04:47.322 --> 04:48.861
How you doing?

04:49.185 --> 04:50.390
I'm good.

04:51.814 --> 04:53.982
I... I'm worried about you.

04:55.442 --> 04:57.200
- About this guy?
- Yeah.

04:57.443 --> 04:59.987
You are barely healed from the last fight.

05:00.019 --> 05:01.284
This is different.

05:01.404 --> 05:03.892
I'm fighting in the same weight class.

05:03.916 --> 05:05.504
You don't have to worry.

05:08.030 --> 05:11.131
But you're coming, right?

05:12.467 --> 05:14.271
Well, you know I can't watch you fight.

05:14.311 --> 05:16.012
You don't have to watch.

05:16.872 --> 05:18.873
You can just sit in the dressing room.

05:18.907 --> 05:20.930
It's a big fight.

05:21.476 --> 05:24.729
It's important to me,
mom. I need you there.

05:26.236 --> 05:27.630
It would mean a lot to me.

05:31.451 --> 05:33.853
Of course I'm gonna be there.

05:33.888 --> 05:35.770
Finally.

05:35.785 --> 05:37.657
My back teeth are floating.

05:37.692 --> 05:39.644
I don't even... that's...

05:39.764 --> 05:43.078
- You ready to roll?
- Yes, I am, Captain.

05:43.198 --> 05:46.996
Mom, we'll be back in
about, uh... about an hour.

05:47.116 --> 05:50.279
- I'll be here.
- All right.

05:50.399 --> 05:53.471
No autographs, please.
No autographs, please.

06:06.785 --> 06:08.752
All right. That's it.

06:08.787 --> 06:10.454
Relax. Stretch out.

06:10.489 --> 06:12.390
Hey, Joe, can I talk to you for a minute?

06:12.424 --> 06:14.325
I want to go over some things for tonight.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.942
Hey. How'd it go this morning?

06:19.509 --> 06:21.889
I fucking hate needles, but it was fine.

06:21.909 --> 06:23.466
You're not looking for a vein.

06:23.501 --> 06:24.978
It can't get much easier.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.437
When's the next one?

06:27.471 --> 06:29.173
When I give it to you.

06:29.293 --> 06:31.408
Look, as long as you're getting it from me,

06:31.442 --> 06:32.642
I'll control the dosage.

06:32.677 --> 06:34.085
The shit's pretty fucking magical,

06:34.102 --> 06:35.349
but it's not a way of life.

06:35.469 --> 06:37.682
When you're all recovered, we're done.

06:37.715 --> 06:39.700
- That's all I need.
- All right.

06:41.572 --> 06:43.095
What are you gonna do until the fight?

06:44.270 --> 06:46.456
Maybe lay around a little bit.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.410
Sleep.

06:48.530 --> 06:50.298
Poop, if I'm so inclined.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.424
What about you?

06:51.472 --> 06:53.262
Turn my fucking head off, man.

06:53.296 --> 06:54.697
I don't know. Shit.

06:54.732 --> 06:56.964
I suck at waiting.

06:58.368 --> 07:02.571
Lisa and I used to, uh, go to Lacma.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.117
There was this artist there
who did these, like, giant,

07:07.584 --> 07:09.832
shiny dogs. Huge.

07:09.832 --> 07:11.260
And there was one that was just

07:11.380 --> 07:13.518
vacuum cleaners in a case.

07:14.794 --> 07:16.485
Like a sculpture?

07:17.554 --> 07:19.139
Very perceptive, Jay.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.724
- Like art, you know?
- Yeah.

07:21.758 --> 07:24.728
You know, we would wander
around together and just, like,

07:25.082 --> 07:29.923
after a while, they all
start to make sense, you know?

07:30.043 --> 07:32.535
Yes, but museums exhaust me, sir.

07:32.568 --> 07:34.150
They're exhausting.

07:34.186 --> 07:35.703
It's 'cause you're a fucking philistine.

07:35.738 --> 07:38.173
Hey, Mac. Come over here, man.

07:40.342 --> 07:41.660
Wow.

07:41.681 --> 07:44.111
What were you guys talking
about over there, huh?

07:44.142 --> 07:45.513
Titties and racecars.

07:45.547 --> 07:46.962
- Oh.
- What's up?

07:47.082 --> 07:49.306
I will be hosting the post-fight party

07:49.317 --> 07:51.495
at casa de Kulina this evening.

07:51.508 --> 07:54.067
It's gonna be a very special night.

07:54.864 --> 07:57.191
And win or lose, I've been a good boy.

07:57.225 --> 08:00.516
But this behavior will
abruptly conclude this evening.

08:01.346 --> 08:02.254
What do you have in mind?

08:02.286 --> 08:03.485
I would like everything

08:03.504 --> 08:05.208
that gets me high, low, and in between.

08:05.254 --> 08:06.213
I want to wake up tomorrow

08:06.265 --> 08:07.739
and remember shit that didn't happen, Mac,

08:07.743 --> 08:09.791
so whatever you got that does that,

08:10.305 --> 08:11.903
I will put it inside of me.

08:12.817 --> 08:13.945
It's gonna be one of those nights.

08:13.974 --> 08:16.291
Oh, yes, it's going to
be one of those nights.

08:16.411 --> 08:17.619
Oh, yeah!

08:18.397 --> 08:19.780
Except for you.

08:19.814 --> 08:21.715
Not you because you're on parole.

08:49.141 --> 08:52.878
You owe me like 20 bucks, just so you know.

09:03.317 --> 09:05.631
Can I talk to my fighter, please?

09:10.461 --> 09:12.825
I made a shitty mistake, Ryan.

09:12.860 --> 09:14.361
I should have been here.

09:14.395 --> 09:16.129
No fucking excuse.

09:16.163 --> 09:19.264
- It's okay.
- No, man, it's not okay.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.418
You did everything I asked you to do.

09:21.438 --> 09:22.249
You did everything right,

09:22.253 --> 09:23.694
and I asked you to do a lot, Ryan.

09:23.958 --> 09:24.803
Mm.

09:25.586 --> 09:27.074
You gave a lot, too. I mean,

09:27.194 --> 09:28.997
I wouldn't be this far without you.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.544
The cut went well. I'm fine.

09:33.046 --> 09:33.675
If you don't mind,

09:33.727 --> 09:35.723
I'd rather just set this shit aside

09:35.748 --> 09:37.149
and focus on the fight.

09:38.684 --> 09:40.383
What do you need from me right now?

09:40.820 --> 09:42.787
I wouldn't mind a few hours alone,

09:42.822 --> 09:44.490
get my head right.

09:44.815 --> 09:47.192
Done. I'll clear the gym out.

09:47.608 --> 09:51.363
You and Lisa, too, if that's... cool.

09:53.933 --> 09:54.900
Okay.

09:55.165 --> 09:56.935
Place is all yours.

10:05.878 --> 10:07.558
Is Jay still asleep?

10:07.588 --> 10:09.462
Yeah, the door's shut.

10:10.150 --> 10:13.471
Probably get him up pretty soon.

10:14.169 --> 10:16.954
Should I make some food for the party?

10:17.389 --> 10:19.759
It's, uh... it's not that kind of party.

10:22.694 --> 10:23.733
What?

10:24.584 --> 10:26.761
Show me your arms.

10:26.881 --> 10:28.179
What?

10:28.299 --> 10:30.194
Come on, Nate. Show me.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.239
What are you d... mom, what the fuck?

10:35.907 --> 10:38.056
I found it in the bathroom.

10:38.461 --> 10:40.101
- What are you using?
- Nothing.

10:40.132 --> 10:43.129
Come on. Who you talking to here?

10:43.481 --> 10:44.958
You took forever in there this morning,

10:44.998 --> 10:46.206
and I heard you rustling around.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.850
What are you taking? Is it... is it oxy?

10:47.885 --> 10:50.852
Oxy? No. It's HGH, okay?

10:51.055 --> 10:52.722
It's to help my recovery.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.706
It's really not a big deal.

10:55.826 --> 10:57.138
Well...

10:57.572 --> 10:59.841
Well, you have to be
careful with that stuff.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.932
Your dad started in on that,
and it got super-expensive.

11:02.967 --> 11:04.857
A... and people don't even
know very much about it.

11:04.896 --> 11:06.803
Some people think it grows cancer.

11:08.564 --> 11:09.782
Okay.

11:09.974 --> 11:11.292
It's temporary.

11:11.675 --> 11:13.055
I promise.

11:16.346 --> 11:18.147
Can you please not tell Jay and dad?

11:21.069 --> 11:22.821
It's your thing.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.521
You just be careful.

11:44.373 --> 11:45.874
I'm good.

11:57.686 --> 11:59.554
I'm sorry.

12:02.658 --> 12:04.506
I know it's not completely your fault,

12:04.529 --> 12:06.807
but it was really fucked up.

12:07.162 --> 12:08.215
I know.

12:08.335 --> 12:10.068
I know.

12:12.467 --> 12:13.600
No excuses.

12:13.635 --> 12:15.017
I'm gonna go see Dr. Kramer,

12:15.060 --> 12:16.447
and he'll give me
something I can live with.

12:16.471 --> 12:17.840
There are options.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.649
You want to tear me apart?

12:22.694 --> 12:23.848
You should tear me apart

12:23.968 --> 12:25.358
- 'cause I deserve it.
- I don't want to tear you apart.

12:25.390 --> 12:27.147
It's fucking exhausting.

12:30.685 --> 12:33.342
You know what the worst
part about last night was?

12:34.689 --> 12:36.181
I didn't miss you.

12:38.859 --> 12:43.166
I was worried and scared,
but I didn't miss you.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.568
I slept right through the
night, and I never do that.

12:53.007 --> 12:54.974
I don't want it anymore.

12:58.412 --> 13:00.158
You're leaving me?

13:01.799 --> 13:03.713
I think you want me to.

13:10.315 --> 13:12.424
See? Yeah.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.094
I can't be here right now.
I'll see you at the fight.

13:51.563 --> 13:54.478
- Garo know we're here?
- Yeah.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.835
He's ready for the walk-through.

14:03.608 --> 14:05.108
Here's how it's gonna go.

14:05.143 --> 14:06.366
Jay, you're up first.

14:06.396 --> 14:07.882
90 minutes out, we'll wrap hands.

14:07.912 --> 14:09.461
45, we'll start the warm-up.

14:09.502 --> 14:11.038
When they're ready for us,
they'll knock on the door.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.384
You'll be on deck. Same for both of you.

14:13.418 --> 14:14.985
Nate, you're gonna be in Jay's corner.

14:15.406 --> 14:17.254
Ryan, I'll be with you.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.990
Questions? You need anything?

14:20.416 --> 14:21.724
Good?

14:22.587 --> 14:23.760
Okay.

14:23.795 --> 14:25.737
Let's go do a walk-through
before the crowd gets here.

14:25.756 --> 14:27.338
Nate, I want you to come.

14:30.301 --> 14:32.602
All right, so they're gonna stop you here.

14:32.636 --> 14:34.270
The lights will go down.

14:34.305 --> 14:36.874
A guy will come out, give you a count...

14:36.994 --> 14:39.175
three, two, one... your music will cue.

14:39.209 --> 14:40.876
Off we go.

14:45.182 --> 14:47.431
Jump in the cage. Get a feel for it.

14:56.526 --> 14:58.724
Jay said you were working a bit.

14:58.844 --> 15:00.329
Yeah, a little bit.

15:00.363 --> 15:02.168
How's the knee holding up?

15:02.288 --> 15:03.778
It's good.

15:03.981 --> 15:05.824
He said you were gimpy.

15:06.097 --> 15:07.769
I was sore.

15:07.804 --> 15:09.752
I'm working it out. It's all good.

15:10.289 --> 15:12.974
Don't rush it, okay?
You're ahead of schedule.

15:14.005 --> 15:15.807
You're the one telling
me to get back at it.

15:15.838 --> 15:18.279
I push you so you know what's at stake.

15:18.314 --> 15:20.215
And now you're ahead of the game.

15:20.249 --> 15:22.925
You need to be patient.
You're not desperate.

15:23.045 --> 15:24.719
You have no fuckups.

15:25.396 --> 15:28.616
I don't ever want to see
you fight for your life.

15:29.391 --> 15:32.693
These two guys...
there's no room for error.

15:32.728 --> 15:34.495
I mean, they have a chance,

15:34.529 --> 15:35.577
but they got to pop now

15:35.609 --> 15:36.866
if they want a run at something big.

15:36.899 --> 15:39.199
You don't. You're young, man.

15:41.870 --> 15:42.996
Look at me.

15:43.938 --> 15:46.139
You don't need to live in chaos.

15:47.066 --> 15:49.392
You don't even know what
kind of fighter you are yet.

15:50.712 --> 15:51.926
All right?

15:53.404 --> 15:55.182
Come on, let's let
these guys have the ring.

15:55.216 --> 15:56.593
Come on.

15:58.097 --> 16:00.099
You don't want that fucking view.

16:01.089 --> 16:04.491
Hey, you better win tonight.

16:04.525 --> 16:06.444
Better win that belt.

16:07.061 --> 16:08.628
So I can fucking take it from you.

16:08.998 --> 16:11.221
You'd never fight me. I've
got the face of an angel.

16:11.260 --> 16:12.284
Yeah.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.868
I'd make you a hideous man, Mr. Wheeler.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.049
Killer tonight.

16:23.169 --> 16:25.470
If we make it here, man...

16:26.447 --> 16:29.315
Boy, it's a whole nother fucking level.

16:39.185 --> 16:41.427
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

16:54.841 --> 16:57.038
Is it hard for you to watch this?

16:57.889 --> 16:59.545
No, I'm used to it.

17:00.532 --> 17:02.710
I can't do it.

17:03.267 --> 17:06.051
Every time they get hit, I just die.

17:07.036 --> 17:10.487
I'm sure it would be
different if it was my child.

17:12.208 --> 17:15.576
You know both my boys love you.

17:15.611 --> 17:18.943
They just have so much respect for you.

17:19.762 --> 17:21.982
I love them, too.

17:23.601 --> 17:25.834
And... the way they talk about you,

17:25.868 --> 17:29.484
I was just, like, "God, shut up."

17:29.788 --> 17:31.759
And then, I got curious,

17:31.793 --> 17:35.904
and I was like, "who
is this fucking woman?"

17:37.265 --> 17:40.096
But now I see what they mean.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.570
You got a lot going on.

17:46.042 --> 17:48.108
It's nice of you to say.

17:53.641 --> 17:57.874
You know, I think maybe you
have the wrong idea about me.

17:58.390 --> 18:01.702
What idea do you think I have about you?

18:01.822 --> 18:04.157
I've never said anything.

18:05.492 --> 18:08.261
You think I abandoned my children.

18:11.832 --> 18:14.096
It's a regret.

18:16.019 --> 18:18.612
Every day, I wake up every morning,

18:18.638 --> 18:20.251
and I can't believe I could have done that.

18:20.252 --> 18:22.470
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

18:22.480 --> 18:24.242
Nothing.

18:24.475 --> 18:27.446
I... I don't even understand
why you're talking to me.

18:28.782 --> 18:31.917
'Cause you were sitting here alone.

18:32.313 --> 18:35.068
Okay.

18:35.722 --> 18:38.308
Well, there's no good
conversation for us to have.

18:38.329 --> 18:39.807
Mm.

18:42.744 --> 18:45.539
I just wanted you to
know that I respect you.

18:47.665 --> 18:50.004
I've been through the shit you're in,

18:50.480 --> 18:52.343
and it sucks.

18:53.339 --> 18:56.341
And you're already doing it better than me.

19:03.515 --> 19:06.517
I don't want to take anything from you.

19:08.809 --> 19:11.787
What could you possibly take away from me?

19:15.038 --> 19:17.144
None of it's mine.

19:26.437 --> 19:28.509
What an unbelievable night of fights

19:28.519 --> 19:29.826
we have for you tonight,

19:29.841 --> 19:32.323
and it's headlined by the
return of Ryan Wheeler.

19:32.443 --> 19:33.924
And we all know the story...

19:33.948 --> 19:36.546
a former champ who was
at the top of the division

19:36.581 --> 19:38.129
until his life spun out of control,

19:38.151 --> 19:39.268
and now he's back, Kenny,

19:39.309 --> 19:41.336
but he hasn't been around for five years.

19:41.352 --> 19:42.870
So what can we expect from him tonight?

19:42.990 --> 19:45.224
Well, that's the question.
Uh, what does he have left,

19:45.250 --> 19:46.697
and how good was he to begin with?

19:46.711 --> 19:48.963
Remember, he never
really was tested before,

19:48.983 --> 19:51.405
never defended the belt, so we'll see.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.527
All right, well, he's gonna have quite
the challenge tonight in Matt Rynders.

19:54.542 --> 19:56.342
Yeah, Rynders is an absolute animal.

19:56.378 --> 19:58.566
Uh, truly one of the emerging
stars in the division,

19:58.589 --> 20:00.042
a guy who a lot of people believe

20:00.057 --> 20:02.120
may be the future at 155.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.787
But the guy that I'm most
excited about is Jay Kulina.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.376
Trains under his father,
the great Alvey Kulina,

20:07.385 --> 20:08.601
alongside Wheeler.

20:09.123 --> 20:11.867
A guy who has, really, all
the talent in the world.

20:11.901 --> 20:13.336
Exciting fighter to watch,

20:13.370 --> 20:14.999
but really has been
getting himself in trouble

20:15.028 --> 20:16.421
- outside the cage.
- That's right.

20:16.459 --> 20:18.941
There's certainly no shortage
of drama here tonight.

20:20.075 --> 20:21.705
Jay. You're on deck.

20:22.294 --> 20:23.928
- All right.
- Here we go.

20:24.161 --> 20:25.847
Fuck him up, man. You got this.

20:25.886 --> 20:28.498
You're gonna murder
this fucking kid, right?

20:30.229 --> 20:31.726
Here.

20:32.245 --> 20:34.203
You want me to fight him for you?

20:34.323 --> 20:36.057
You're magic.

20:36.091 --> 20:38.596
You were born to do this, okay?

20:39.354 --> 20:40.339
I love you.

20:43.904 --> 20:46.283
Mom. Come on. Stop.

20:46.302 --> 20:48.637
I know. I love you. I love you. I love you.

20:49.018 --> 20:51.241
I'll be back here.

20:52.074 --> 20:53.775
Go knock his teeth out.

20:57.242 --> 20:59.480
It's your cage, your fight.

20:59.514 --> 21:01.816
You just go take it, all right?

21:05.020 --> 21:08.528
Whoo!

21:08.648 --> 21:10.624
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

21:10.655 --> 21:13.500
making his way into the
cage of our co-feature,

21:13.620 --> 21:18.146
King Beast promotions, Jay Kulina!

21:33.014 --> 21:34.614
Whoo!

21:41.789 --> 21:43.489
Glove check.

21:50.787 --> 21:51.798
Good.

21:53.066 --> 21:54.166
Hup!

21:54.201 --> 21:56.135
Move, move, move.

21:56.169 --> 21:59.385
Good. Good. Good.

21:59.505 --> 22:01.006
Ha!

22:02.008 --> 22:03.442
- Hup! Aah!
- Good.

22:03.476 --> 22:05.510
All right, gentlemen, first round.

22:05.545 --> 22:08.113
Are you ready to fight? You ready to fight?

22:08.148 --> 22:09.214
Hit it! Let's go!

22:11.318 --> 22:14.018
Go get him, Jay! You got this!

22:30.169 --> 22:31.836
I'm gonna stop it.

22:31.871 --> 22:33.471
Over. Over. It's over.

22:36.909 --> 22:38.676
Jay!

22:38.710 --> 22:41.012
Whoo!

22:41.046 --> 22:42.313
Jay!

22:42.348 --> 22:43.848
Woo! Woo!

22:43.883 --> 22:45.083
Jay!

22:46.585 --> 22:49.152
Whoo!

22:49.187 --> 22:52.523
K.O.!

22:55.026 --> 22:56.827
Next time, boys.

23:06.095 --> 23:08.297

I love you, man.

23:50.380 --> 23:52.739

here is the one and only

24:47.026 --> 24:49.027
All right, gentlemen, we've
been over the rules already.

24:49.062 --> 24:50.680
Protect yourself at all times.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.534
Obey my commands at all times.

24:52.544 --> 24:54.233
Touch gloves if you want now.

24:54.265 --> 24:55.815

- Very well.

24:55.845 --> 24:57.739
At the sound of the bell, come
on out and handle your business.

24:57.859 --> 24:58.872
Let's go.

25:03.909 --> 25:06.978
Breathe. Breathe. Deep breaths.

25:27.499 --> 25:29.421
Let your hands go! Let your hands go!

25:41.746 --> 25:43.880
Move your head.

25:54.325 --> 25:55.225
Nice.

25:59.831 --> 26:01.331
Nice! Nice!

26:12.810 --> 26:14.544
Come on. Squeeze it! Squeeze!

26:16.913 --> 26:18.748
Squeeze it!

26:28.992 --> 26:31.393
There you go.

26:33.964 --> 26:36.665
Smell stick, smell stick.

26:36.699 --> 26:38.433
You're doing great.
You're doing great, man.

26:38.468 --> 26:40.969
Feel good to be back? Feel good to be back?

26:41.003 --> 26:43.204
All right, beautiful. Beautiful.

26:43.239 --> 26:45.974
I want you to relax, okay?
Listen to me... settle in.

26:46.008 --> 26:47.709
Stop trying to knock him out in one punch.

26:47.744 --> 26:48.771
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

26:48.791 --> 26:50.560
- That's not the fucking game.
- Second round!

26:50.594 --> 26:53.147
You ready to fight? You ready to fight?

26:53.182 --> 26:55.035

Hold your head up. There you go.

Fight.

Let the hands go!

27:13.568 --> 27:15.269
Fight for it!

27:16.605 --> 27:18.606
Nice! Good!

No, no, head up. Head up.

27:40.361 --> 27:41.261
Come on.

27:41.296 --> 27:42.595
Don't say anything!

27:42.630 --> 27:44.706
Come on, Ryan! Let's go!

27:45.866 --> 27:48.034
Defend yourself. Don't give in.

27:48.068 --> 27:49.902
Almost there. Gonna stop this.

27:54.875 --> 27:56.476
Ohh.

28:11.391 --> 28:12.791
I can tell you if you want to.

28:12.826 --> 28:15.727
You need some sort of prize...

28:17.129 --> 28:18.564
You're gonna finish this guy.

28:18.598 --> 28:22.000
You're like a mouse in a maze.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.971
Let's go. Let's go!

28:26.005 --> 28:27.739
Work the body.

28:32.678 --> 28:34.579
Combinations!

28:34.613 --> 28:35.981
Take him down!

28:44.823 --> 28:45.857
Nice.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.475
Stop.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.609
Stop, stop, stop.

29:05.643 --> 29:07.378
Yes!

29:10.781 --> 29:11.982
Yes!

29:12.017 --> 29:13.317
There we go!

29:29.166 --> 29:30.767
He all right?

29:30.801 --> 29:32.268
He good?

29:33.871 --> 29:35.438
Hands up.

29:38.342 --> 29:40.158
Ryan Wheeler, what a night.

29:40.168 --> 29:41.794
Did you ever think you'd be back here?

29:41.819 --> 29:43.536
Yeah, I just got a couple
things I want to say, Ken.

29:43.536 --> 29:44.447
Sorry to snatch it.

29:44.677 --> 29:46.196
Uh, first of all,

29:46.424 --> 29:48.405
I want to thank all of you
guys for coming here tonight.

29:48.419 --> 29:49.991
It's why fighters like me fight.

29:50.054 --> 29:51.220
You guys are the best.

29:52.988 --> 29:55.572
Matt Rynders, you're a tough kid, man.

29:55.787 --> 29:57.225
All respect to you.

29:57.260 --> 29:59.628
Uh, just want to thank some people...

29:59.904 --> 30:03.098
my parents, uh...

30:03.424 --> 30:05.845
Everybody at Navy St.
MMA, Venice, California.

30:05.861 --> 30:09.173
Joe-Daddy, Jay Kulina, Nate Kulina.

30:09.376 --> 30:11.418
Watch out for Nate
Kulina. He's almost back.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.808
I'm telling you, guys...
the Kulina boys are coming!

30:14.171 --> 30:15.458
Lisa Prince.

30:15.985 --> 30:19.055
And, uh, most of all, I got to thank

30:19.449 --> 30:22.446
my coach, Alvey Kulina.

30:24.027 --> 30:25.650
You gave me everything, man, when...

30:25.727 --> 30:27.288
when everybody else was
calling me a piece of shit

30:27.319 --> 30:28.750
and counting me out,

30:29.092 --> 30:30.524
you stuck with me.

30:30.819 --> 30:33.401
You lifted me up. You you gave me a home.

30:33.743 --> 30:35.220
You, uh...

30:36.060 --> 30:38.544
You just knew exactly what
I needed before I even did.

30:39.529 --> 30:40.820
And, uh...

30:42.541 --> 30:46.290
Everything I have is because
of you, Alvey. Thank you.

30:49.043 --> 30:51.034
All right, Ryan, take... take
us through the fight, man.

30:51.047 --> 30:52.440
You guys came out throwing bombs.

30:52.460 --> 30:53.701
Was that a part of the strategy?

30:53.709 --> 30:55.476
Well, yeah, I knew that
Matt wanted a brawl,

30:55.522 --> 30:56.517
so I was gonna bring it to him

30:56.534 --> 30:58.761
and try to get him on the ground.

30:58.806 --> 31:00.570
He stuffed me a few times,

31:00.636 --> 31:02.958
so I made an adjustment, but,
like I said, I was prepared.

31:03.003 --> 31:04.177
It was a good fight.

31:04.380 --> 31:07.961
All right, your new champ
at 155, Ryan Wheeler!

31:22.137 --> 31:23.550
Hey.

31:24.087 --> 31:26.539
- They fix you up?
- Yeah, they took care of me.

31:26.574 --> 31:28.033
Ah. Yeah.

31:28.041 --> 31:29.442
Thank you.

31:30.878 --> 31:32.845
That was a hell of a fucking fight.

31:33.794 --> 31:35.402
You're a fucking warrior, truly.

31:35.415 --> 31:36.834
You gave me a killer game plan, man.

31:36.847 --> 31:38.150
You were right about everything.

31:38.189 --> 31:39.789
Doesn't mean anything
unless you execute it.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.420
It's the fighter. It's not the coach.

31:45.926 --> 31:47.827
You going to Nate and Jay's?

31:47.861 --> 31:51.043
Nah, fuck. You kidding me? No way.

31:51.665 --> 31:54.284
I want to keep this going with you and me.

31:55.502 --> 31:57.352
We don't have to talk about that now.

31:57.472 --> 32:00.552
No, really, man. We,
uh... we got a good thing.

32:01.107 --> 32:03.475
You're my coach, Alvey.

32:03.510 --> 32:04.886
I was...

32:04.998 --> 32:07.306
I was very fucking pissed off
when you didn't make the cut,

32:07.317 --> 32:08.957
but, you know...

32:09.215 --> 32:11.063
When I left you,

32:11.418 --> 32:13.757
you took me back. You
were a man about it. So,

32:14.263 --> 32:15.975
one for me. One for you.

32:15.985 --> 32:17.989
Now we're even.

32:18.024 --> 32:19.731
I appreciate it.

32:19.758 --> 32:22.253
Yeah.

32:22.628 --> 32:24.259
You know, you took a
couple shots to the head,

32:24.263 --> 32:25.789
so maybe we should give it a few days.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.839
Alvey, they want to grab
you for an interview.

32:40.078 --> 32:41.400
Okay.

32:42.048 --> 32:43.162
Anyway...

32:43.466 --> 32:46.068
That's your stuff. You're all good to go.

32:48.820 --> 32:50.860
It's all right up there for you, man.

32:51.122 --> 32:52.857
Okay?

32:52.891 --> 32:54.405
Don't fuck it up.

32:54.525 --> 32:56.060
Yes, sir.

32:59.590 --> 33:00.724
Well, I'm proud of my guys.

33:00.754 --> 33:02.547
You know, Ryan and Jay both
fought their hearts out.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.369
And, uh, you know, we got
the results we wanted to.

33:04.369 --> 33:05.676
You mentioned before that

33:05.796 --> 33:07.771
Nate's almost ready to go again.

33:07.805 --> 33:09.537
You add Jay and Wheeler...

33:09.537 --> 33:12.146
that's three top fighters from your camp.

33:12.186 --> 33:12.996
That's got to feel good.

33:13.021 --> 33:14.819
Yeah, no, it's... it's good.

33:14.846 --> 33:16.569
I feel very fortunate, but, uh, you know,

33:16.585 --> 33:18.044
you're only as good as your fighters.

33:18.068 --> 33:19.145
I said that when I was fighting,

33:19.183 --> 33:20.449
and I continue to say it today.

33:20.763 --> 33:22.252
All right, well, there you have it.

33:22.286 --> 33:24.402
Alvey Kulina quickly establishing himself

33:24.438 --> 33:26.655
as one of the top trainers in MMA today.

33:26.690 --> 33:28.011
Thanks, bud. All right, man.

33:28.048 --> 33:28.958
Okay. Good job.

33:31.495 --> 33:33.481
- Congratulations.
- You, too.

33:36.266 --> 33:38.166
You gonna come home?

33:39.246 --> 33:42.271
I'll, um... I'll let you know where I stay.

33:50.213 --> 33:54.792
This drink is for my
little brother, Nathaniel!

33:57.853 --> 33:59.955
The youngest member of the tribe!

33:59.989 --> 34:02.524
We're gonna be doing
this for you soon, son!

34:02.558 --> 34:04.864
'Cause you're a fighter,
and when you don't fight,

34:04.894 --> 34:07.296
you become highly irascible.

34:07.750 --> 34:09.937
That's a big word, Jay.
Don't fucking hurt yourself.

34:09.967 --> 34:11.558
"Irascible."

34:11.558 --> 34:13.612
You have a churning spirit within you.

34:13.643 --> 34:15.717
And it concerns me.

34:15.838 --> 34:18.120
And you, Lisa.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.340
Yes?

34:19.373 --> 34:21.476
This one is for you.

34:21.510 --> 34:22.643
Aww.

34:22.678 --> 34:26.313
Because I... fucking... love you.

34:26.348 --> 34:28.156
- I love you, too.
- And you know what?

34:28.183 --> 34:30.232
You need to quit fucking around
and start managing fighters...

34:30.262 --> 34:32.367
- I don't... oh, yeah...
- And start making kings and queens

34:32.487 --> 34:36.357
because you're that... fucking... good.

34:36.391 --> 34:38.496
All right? You got me a fight

34:38.511 --> 34:40.108
when nobody else would
get me a fucking fight

34:40.123 --> 34:41.502
and everybody thought I was a cunt.

34:41.527 --> 34:43.196
Because you are a fucking cunt.

34:43.431 --> 34:46.781
Yeah, but now I'm a fighting cunt!

34:46.801 --> 34:47.647
What?!

34:49.370 --> 34:50.337
Bam!

34:51.505 --> 34:53.755
Stop the party!

34:54.030 --> 34:58.951
It's the champion, Ryan Wheeler!

34:59.266 --> 35:01.747
Kill me, you motherfucker!

35:03.203 --> 35:06.219
You're killing me, Captain Golden Cock,

35:06.253 --> 35:10.384
with your flaxen fucking hair
and your toothy little grin,

35:10.391 --> 35:11.491
you little bastard.

35:11.525 --> 35:13.017
You want a shot?

35:13.137 --> 35:14.911
- No, no, I'm good. Thanks.
- Come on, come on.

35:14.935 --> 35:16.150
- No, I can't.
- Shh.

35:16.312 --> 35:19.008
- Shh.
- I had one earlier. I'm on parole.

35:19.021 --> 35:20.566
I got to piss in a cup on Monday.

35:20.601 --> 35:22.774
I thought you let that
guy drink your sweat.

35:22.853 --> 35:24.401
I thought you had one up on him.

35:24.521 --> 35:26.554
- Is that what happened? Wait.
- He's not...

35:26.573 --> 35:27.873
- Hold on a second.
- That's not...

35:27.956 --> 35:29.322
Excuse me, my friends.

35:29.354 --> 35:31.531
Nathaniel, can I speak to
you for a moment, please?

35:32.841 --> 35:34.360
In my office?

35:34.948 --> 35:36.181
- Yeah.
- Where's mom?

35:36.216 --> 35:37.205
She's in the bedroom.

35:37.234 --> 35:39.051
Can you do me a favor and look after her

35:39.085 --> 35:40.510
because I'm gonna be
unavailable for a little bit?

35:40.531 --> 35:42.128
I don't want her to see me like this, okay?

35:42.153 --> 35:43.688
Go. Boom!

35:43.723 --> 35:45.538
You know what I'm saying? Come on, son.

35:45.558 --> 35:47.624
Come on, son. Yes, sir!

35:47.993 --> 35:51.386
Champion of the world!

35:51.469 --> 35:53.253
- Great fight, man.
- Thanks, brother.

35:53.269 --> 35:54.476
I'm proud of you.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.422
Thanks, man.

35:55.447 --> 35:57.628
Mm, mnh-mnh. Don't leave me.

35:57.748 --> 35:59.710
Nate, we're drinking buddies!

36:04.609 --> 36:06.618
I have this guy.

36:14.853 --> 36:17.372
So it's gonna be that kind of night.

36:17.492 --> 36:19.215
Ahh, yes.

36:19.236 --> 36:20.958
It's gonna be that kind of night.

36:22.293 --> 36:25.455
Until my face is numb.

36:26.711 --> 36:29.633
I was really proud of you tonight.

36:29.668 --> 36:31.569
Thanks.

36:31.603 --> 36:33.638
And you were right. I mean,

36:33.758 --> 36:36.373
I'm just a fucking mouse in a maze.

37:06.503 --> 37:08.738
Such a little wallflower.

37:10.855 --> 37:12.641
It's okay.

37:12.675 --> 37:15.169
You let them come to you.

37:16.313 --> 37:17.746
Scoot over.

37:22.085 --> 37:24.686
I like that you're still using a glass.

37:24.721 --> 37:27.673
- Like a gentleman.
- Mm.

37:29.558 --> 37:31.860
Hey, where's Jay?

37:34.046 --> 37:36.131
Oh.

37:36.165 --> 37:38.166
I don't want to know.

37:42.538 --> 37:44.380
Are you having a good time?

37:44.500 --> 37:46.051
Mm-hmm.

37:46.171 --> 37:47.873
Okay.

37:48.444 --> 37:50.861
It's hard to tell.

37:51.742 --> 37:54.149
Should I be wearing a party hat?

37:54.183 --> 37:56.735
Do we have party hats?
I'd love a party hat.

37:58.354 --> 38:00.907
Finally.

38:01.027 --> 38:03.864
Mom, I'm happy.

38:04.693 --> 38:07.028
You don't have to be happy.

38:07.062 --> 38:09.063
Just be yourself.

38:09.616 --> 38:12.887
Or else, it's gonna feel like
there's a stranger living inside you.

38:14.202 --> 38:16.370
And then you'll never be happy.

38:19.474 --> 38:22.075
Can I have that?

38:22.109 --> 38:24.110
I changed my mind.

38:27.815 --> 38:29.416
Whoo!

38:41.168 --> 38:45.816
I fucking tolerate so much
shit from you fighters.

38:45.936 --> 38:47.345
Oh, please, please.

38:47.465 --> 38:50.150
- You don't tolerate shit from nobody.
- Mm.

38:50.270 --> 38:53.639
I tolerate everything.
I worry about everything.

38:54.363 --> 38:56.743
I need a fucking break.

38:57.678 --> 38:59.568
I need a hotel.

39:01.481 --> 39:03.823
- Just stay here.
- Hmm.

39:04.451 --> 39:06.932
No, that's a great idea.

39:07.320 --> 39:10.488
What can I do? Can I... how can I...

39:10.523 --> 39:12.490
Make you feel better?

39:12.525 --> 39:13.735
You can't.

39:13.737 --> 39:15.794
- It doesn't work that way.
- Why?

39:15.829 --> 39:17.548
- 'Cause it doesn't.
- Why can't it?

39:17.578 --> 39:21.433
Because it doesn't just
happen all in one night.

39:21.467 --> 39:23.736
You don't get it all back.

39:33.846 --> 39:35.604
Hey, guys. Hey.

39:36.212 --> 39:38.116
I got plenty to go around.

39:40.152 --> 39:41.518
Jay.

39:41.553 --> 39:42.820
Jay.

39:42.855 --> 39:44.312
Jay!

39:44.323 --> 39:45.289
What?

39:45.323 --> 39:47.148
May I get involved over there?

39:47.168 --> 39:49.366
Yeah, dude. Bring that over here.

39:52.664 --> 39:54.198
Hey, Elaine.

39:54.233 --> 39:55.733
I got this ready for you.

40:05.710 --> 40:07.857
Hey. Hey, man. Hey.

40:07.887 --> 40:09.346
What the fuck's the matter with you?

40:09.381 --> 40:10.347
Jay, look at me.

40:10.382 --> 40:11.515
What the fuck's going on?

40:11.549 --> 40:12.849
Hey, go get somebody. Go.

40:12.884 --> 40:14.032
- No, wait, wait! I was just...
- Hey.

40:14.055 --> 40:15.218
I was just kidding. I was just...

40:15.253 --> 40:16.595
- "Kidding"?
- Yeah, bro.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.456
You fucking asshole! That's not funny!

40:18.489 --> 40:20.023
I wanted to see if daddy fucking loved me.

40:20.057 --> 40:21.973
- Get out of here.
- Do you fucking love me?

40:22.029 --> 40:23.994
- Yes, you do, you little bastard.
- Oh, oh, oh, yeah, you fucking...

40:24.028 --> 40:25.796
- You're an asshole.
- Mac, do you love me?

40:25.830 --> 40:28.112
- Just shut up.
- Do you fucking love me?

40:28.312 --> 40:29.965
Wait, wait, wait a
second. Stop, stop, stop.

40:30.000 --> 40:30.966
Stop, man. What are you doing?

40:31.001 --> 40:32.517
- What?
- Put your clothes on.

40:32.968 --> 40:34.576
Shh. What do you mean put my clothes on?

40:34.628 --> 40:35.826
Fucking...

40:35.862 --> 40:38.806
- I said fucking put your goddamn clothes on, man.
- Why? Why?

40:39.055 --> 40:40.388
Because, Mac,

40:40.720 --> 40:43.432
this is just not a line
I want to cross with you.

40:43.552 --> 40:45.314
I value our relationship.

40:45.348 --> 40:46.982
- Yeah, I do, too. I don't want to...
- Mac.

40:47.017 --> 40:48.534
- Mac.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

40:48.751 --> 40:51.178
Okay, just get the fuck out of here.

40:51.236 --> 40:52.537
- God.
- Okay?

40:52.708 --> 40:53.988
- Okay.
- Get the fuck out.

40:54.108 --> 40:56.258
- Fuck this.
- Wait, hold on. You need this.

40:56.293 --> 40:58.060
- Can you fix the door?
- Yes, sir, dude.

41:01.298 --> 41:03.398
Well, well, well.

41:03.433 --> 41:06.735
What do we have here?

41:06.769 --> 41:08.936
Oh, we have...

41:37.932 --> 41:39.933
Let me see your I.D.

41:51.178 --> 41:53.913
Barely.

41:53.947 --> 41:55.248
Is there a problem?

41:55.282 --> 41:57.419
Yeah. Not tonight.

41:57.449 --> 41:59.518
I think you've already had plenty.

42:00.854 --> 42:02.851
Are you fucking serious?

42:03.190 --> 42:04.757
I got two cops in there, you know,

42:04.788 --> 42:06.458
if you want to go in and
talk about it with them.

42:09.462 --> 42:11.005
Fuck you.

42:39.398 --> 42:42.133
Hey. Come on in. Hey.

42:45.270 --> 42:46.705
You want a drink?

42:46.739 --> 42:47.706
No.

42:47.740 --> 42:50.064
I can't stay long.

42:50.975 --> 42:53.411
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

42:53.445 --> 42:54.778
Me?

42:54.813 --> 42:57.129
I'm g... I'm great. Yeah.

42:57.249 --> 42:58.813
Yeah?

42:58.933 --> 43:00.984
Yeah.

43:01.019 --> 43:03.588
I think I made a little money tonight.

43:03.622 --> 43:05.956
I got some phone calls from fighters

43:05.990 --> 43:08.125
and a couple sponsors, so, yeah.

43:08.159 --> 43:10.460
Cheers to me.

43:11.095 --> 43:14.131
You get what you want, and then...

43:14.165 --> 43:15.699
What do you got?

43:29.213 --> 43:30.647
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

43:33.284 --> 43:34.988
Nate doesn't look at me when I talk to him.

43:35.008 --> 43:36.213
He won't look me in the eyes.

43:36.223 --> 43:38.988
And Jay... I don't know
where I'm going with him.

43:39.656 --> 43:40.957
I love those boys.

43:41.509 --> 43:44.324
And they don't think I do. And that...

43:44.694 --> 43:46.796
That kills me.

43:47.524 --> 43:49.832
They just want your approval.

43:52.274 --> 43:54.970
All you have to do is put
a hand on their shoulder,

43:55.004 --> 43:56.453
- and they'd melt.
- Mm.

43:56.456 --> 43:59.716
They'll forgive you for
anything if you want them to.

44:00.843 --> 44:03.990
It's different for you because you left.

44:04.110 --> 44:06.212
To them, you died young and pretty,

44:06.263 --> 44:07.964
and you came back a Saint.

44:08.267 --> 44:11.147
I was the piece of shit
with my boot on their throat.

44:11.267 --> 44:12.654
It's different.

44:12.688 --> 44:15.290
Yeah, well, maybe I could
have used a boot on my throat.

44:20.263 --> 44:23.225
Our boys are pretty great, Alvey.

44:24.066 --> 44:26.567
You didn't do everything wrong.

44:29.905 --> 44:32.091
Let me pour you a drink.

44:34.242 --> 44:36.243
No.

44:38.880 --> 44:41.888
What happened with us the other night...

44:43.018 --> 44:45.752
It's not gonna happen again.

44:45.787 --> 44:47.640
It made me feel like a whore.

44:47.760 --> 44:50.455
No, I... I didn't see it like that.

44:51.126 --> 44:53.705
I felt like a whore.

44:54.262 --> 44:57.441
And then I felt bad about Lisa.

44:59.274 --> 45:02.889
You're gonna have to settle
for something eventually, Alvey.

45:04.138 --> 45:07.456
You don't want to be the last man standing.

45:07.952 --> 45:10.243
It's too hard.

45:14.081 --> 45:16.082
I got to go.

45:21.107 --> 45:22.991
Get some rest.

45:48.448 --> 45:50.017
It's good to hear from you, love.

45:50.037 --> 45:51.816
I didn't think I would.

45:53.440 --> 45:55.608
I missed you, Terry.

45:55.821 --> 45:57.622
It's not me you fucking missed.

45:57.656 --> 45:59.224
Get in, anyway.

45:59.259 --> 46:01.426
We'll get you fit again.

46:18.944 --> 46:24.248
Hi. What are you doing?

48:00.910 --> 48:03.283
Most guys run from fights.

48:04.224 --> 48:05.359
'Cause they don't want the answer

48:05.359 --> 48:06.579
to the inevitable question

48:06.581 --> 48:09.440
that every man whispers to himself...

48:10.419 --> 48:12.447
"Am I one of the weak?

48:16.002 --> 48:17.926
Or am I one of the strong?"
