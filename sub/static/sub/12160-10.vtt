00:02.528 --> 00:04.996
Come on, let's go,
we're gonna be late!

00:05.030 --> 00:06.732
Why do we even have to go to church?

00:06.766 --> 00:10.068
Because like everyone else,
we are hedging our bets.

00:10.103 --> 00:11.303
It's Christmastime.

00:11.337 --> 00:14.139
God pays a lot closer attention
this time of year.

00:14.173 --> 00:16.775
It's like October in baseball.
Every game counts.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.977
- I can't find my church purse anywhere.
- What the...

00:19.011 --> 00:21.229
Or the bottom half of that dress.

00:21.264 --> 00:22.764
At least I'm not dressed
like a sister wife.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.382
Well, at least my dress didn't
come with a stripper pole.

00:24.417 --> 00:25.734
Dad.

00:25.768 --> 00:27.936
Hey, it's Christmas.
Deck the halls, not each other.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.888
- Okay, I just have to get my purse.
- No, no, d-d-don't go back up.

00:29.906 --> 00:31.723
You know, trying to
get you guys to go to church

00:31.741 --> 00:33.275
is like herding cats.

00:33.326 --> 00:35.226
Honey, honey, honey,
why don't we just not go?

00:35.244 --> 00:36.945
- We're going to church. Come on, come on, come on. Please?
- All right.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.580
Yeah, but it's just, it's--
it's a week until Christmas,

00:38.614 --> 00:40.031
and I'd rather get stuff done

00:40.065 --> 00:41.500
than sit and pray that it gets done.

00:41.534 --> 00:43.835
Honey, honey, if everyone
who didn't want to go to church

00:43.870 --> 00:45.704
didn't go to church,
it would just be two old women

00:45.738 --> 00:48.239
in the front row,
shushing empty pews.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.542
- I found it. Ready.
- Great, let's go.

00:50.576 --> 00:52.344
- Clashes with your shoes.
- No, no, no. I know what you're doing.

00:52.378 --> 00:53.762
You're just trying to psych me out.

00:53.796 --> 00:55.347
Am I?

00:56.415 --> 00:59.217
Damn it.
Dad, give me two seconds.

00:59.251 --> 01:00.418
It's hopeless.
It's hopeless.

01:00.436 --> 01:01.620
Just a minute.
Turn around, Mandy.

01:01.654 --> 01:02.754
Come on, down the stairs,
down the stairs.

01:02.772 --> 01:04.022
All right, everybody.
Time for church.

01:04.056 --> 01:05.390
- Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!
- All right.

01:05.424 --> 01:08.110
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
This is great. Thank you.

01:08.144 --> 01:11.363
And for the record,
I got the ball rolling.

♪ Hallelujah ♪

02:05.201 --> 02:06.651
That's Boyd's father.
Yeah, I know.

02:06.669 --> 02:08.086
He got Kristin pregnant
and then deserted her.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.086
Y--we all know that.

02:09.121 --> 02:10.505
Well, he doesn't.

02:12.157 --> 02:13.325
Honey, what do you think
he's doing here?

02:13.359 --> 02:14.693
I don't know.

02:14.727 --> 02:16.995
What do you say I drag him out
by his pretty hair and ask him?

02:18.698 --> 02:20.999
Look, I wasn't expecting this
either, but it's Christmas--

02:21.017 --> 02:22.634
happiness, good feelings,

02:22.668 --> 02:24.936
nuts roasting over an open fire.

02:30.343 --> 02:32.644
(Vanessa) Kristin,
what was Ryan doing at church?

02:32.678 --> 02:33.645
(Mike) Yeah.

02:33.679 --> 02:36.348
Okay.

02:36.382 --> 02:38.984
Ryan's back in town,
and he reached out to me,

02:39.018 --> 02:41.419
so we've seen him a couple times.

02:41.454 --> 02:43.989
He wants to be a part of Boyd's life.

02:44.023 --> 02:46.725
Oh, well, honey,
if that's what you want,

02:46.759 --> 02:48.960
then--then you have our full support.

02:48.995 --> 02:51.363
You have your mother's full support.

02:51.397 --> 02:54.716
I'm still in that "what, are you
freaking kidding me?" Camp.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.869
Look, I know what it's like
to have an awesome dad,

02:57.887 --> 02:59.421
and--and even if it's a long shot,

02:59.472 --> 03:01.606
I want Boyd to have
a chance at that, too.

03:01.641 --> 03:02.841
First off, thank you very much.

03:02.875 --> 03:05.677
Second off, I know
exactly what you're doing.

03:05.711 --> 03:07.946
You're complimenting me
so you'll get your way.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.765
I invented this move.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.852
Dad, I know you hate Ryan,
but he's different now.

03:13.886 --> 03:17.105
He's more mature and he's even
been supporting himself.

03:17.156 --> 03:18.223
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

03:18.257 --> 03:21.026
Doesn't matter.

03:21.060 --> 03:22.861
He's a drug dealer, right?

03:22.895 --> 03:24.796
No.

03:24.830 --> 03:30.035
He was recently a jouster
at the Renaissance Faire.

03:30.069 --> 03:33.505
So he actually lowered the bar.

03:39.095 --> 03:44.182
Ah, Earl. Your work
was exceptional this year.

03:44.216 --> 03:46.217
Have a ham.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.387
Okay.

03:49.421 --> 03:51.122
Stuart.

03:51.157 --> 03:55.226
I've never seen
a shoddier performance.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.295
Have a ham.

03:58.965 --> 04:01.099
Hi, Mike.
(Clears throat)

04:01.133 --> 04:04.235
You know, I don't think
this socialist ham giveaway

04:04.270 --> 04:06.638
is a good incentive program.

04:06.672 --> 04:08.073
You want to wear the Santa suit?

04:08.107 --> 04:11.609
Heh. Me in a Santa suit?
I don't think so.

04:11.644 --> 04:13.611
Hey, dad.

04:13.646 --> 04:15.213
Okay. What do you think?
Huh?

04:15.247 --> 04:17.815
Well, baby, I think you are adorable.

04:17.850 --> 04:19.050
Ugh. That's what I was afraid of.

04:19.084 --> 04:22.087
It is really hard
to look sexy in green felt.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.121
Then you've never seen

04:23.155 --> 04:25.824
miss Sandy Duncan in "Peter Pan."

04:25.858 --> 04:27.959
(Laughs) Yeah.

04:27.977 --> 04:30.178
I can't believe I have to
work for spending money.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.831
- Ugh. It's so work-y.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:32.865 --> 04:34.099
Listen, your job here

04:34.133 --> 04:36.300
is to spread holiday cheer
and help out

04:36.319 --> 04:39.604
<i>and</i> also get kids to sit
in angry Santa's lap here.

04:39.638 --> 04:42.040
But only after
they've voided their bladders--

04:42.074 --> 04:43.975
also your responsibility.

04:44.010 --> 04:46.277
All right, Mr. Claus.
I'll do my best.

04:46.312 --> 04:49.364
Oh, Mr. Claus is my father.
Just call me Santa.

04:49.415 --> 04:52.617
All right, Santa. I will try
not to disappoint you.

04:52.651 --> 04:53.868
I have complete faith in you.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.454
Oh, that's what everyone
always says at first.

04:57.489 --> 04:58.790
Hey, Mr. B.?
Yep.

04:58.824 --> 05:00.592
I just want to warn you about Ryan.

05:00.626 --> 05:01.860
Oh, I know he's back,

05:01.894 --> 05:03.795
but you don't need
to feel threatened about that.

05:03.829 --> 05:05.497
(High-pitched voice)
I'm not threatened.

05:05.531 --> 05:07.565
(Normal voice) My voice got all high.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.634
I'm clearly threatened.

05:09.668 --> 05:12.721
I'm telling you, Kristin's not
gonna leave you for the guy.

05:12.772 --> 05:13.938
I didn't think she was.

05:13.973 --> 05:16.674
Why would you even
put that in the air?

05:16.709 --> 05:21.346
'Cause he's a slick, smooth,
you know, good-looking jerk.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.948
You find him good-looking?

05:23.983 --> 05:26.718
(Stammers)

05:26.752 --> 05:28.987
Do you find me good-looking?

05:29.021 --> 05:31.156
Well, legally, as your boss,

05:31.190 --> 05:33.658
I'm not allowed to even answer that.

05:37.079 --> 05:42.167
Hey, Mike. Hey.
Can you give me a sec?

05:42.201 --> 05:45.937
I was gonna tell you.
Ryan's in your office.

05:53.674 --> 05:54.974
Ah. Sorry about that.

05:55.008 --> 05:57.727
I'm selling a sword on Craigslist.

05:57.761 --> 05:59.011
Give me one reason

05:59.046 --> 06:00.880
why I shouldn't
throw you out that window.

06:00.914 --> 06:03.065
Because I came to have
a man-to-man talk with you,

06:03.100 --> 06:06.352
and that won't work
if I'm in the air screaming.

06:07.754 --> 06:08.855
Look, I want to be in Boyd's life.

06:08.889 --> 06:10.139
I want to see him for Christmas.

06:10.190 --> 06:12.992
And I want to be a point guard
for the nuggets.

06:13.026 --> 06:16.229
Look, I know I screwed up,
but I'm his dad, and I'm back.

06:16.263 --> 06:18.131
Until jousting season?

06:18.165 --> 06:20.366
Technically, it's not seasonal.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.169
It's at the pleasure of the King.

06:23.203 --> 06:25.605
You left my daughter and your son.

06:25.639 --> 06:27.573
I know. I was working.
I had a lot of jobs.

06:27.607 --> 06:29.642
I was a singing waiter
on a cruise ship,

06:29.676 --> 06:32.245
and now I'm the senior knight
at the Ren Faire.

06:32.279 --> 06:33.513
And a couple months ago,

06:33.547 --> 06:34.914
I was sitting there
at the head of the round table--

06:34.948 --> 06:36.482
hey, whoa, walk me through that.

06:36.517 --> 06:40.253
Head of a round table--
how does that work?

06:40.287 --> 06:44.457
And I realized I'm at the top of
my game in every way but one--

06:44.491 --> 06:46.459
being a dad.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.395
Wow, that's a--that's
a good smile you got there.

06:49.429 --> 06:51.264
Bet that really works
on the girls, doesn't it?

06:51.298 --> 06:53.299
Well, you know...

06:56.353 --> 06:59.505
Sounds like your acting career
is--is really taking off.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.307
Thank you.

07:01.325 --> 07:03.743
But the--the role
of Boyd's, uh, father

07:03.777 --> 07:06.179
should have been cast
two and a half years ago.

07:06.213 --> 07:07.780
(Knock on door, door opens)

07:07.814 --> 07:09.648
I'm sorry.
How's this going in here?

07:09.666 --> 07:13.019

inside my head out there.

07:23.330 --> 07:26.682
That's wonderful.

Okay, all right, okay, here we go.

07:36.727 --> 07:39.028

Up on Santa's lap.

- There you go, all right, come on.

There you go.
Okay.

(Chuckles) Good job. Next!

07:46.286 --> 07:47.686
No, no, actually,

07:47.704 --> 07:51.407
Santa's gonna warm himself up
with a little Irish coffee.

07:51.458 --> 07:54.693
Hold the coffee.
(Singsongy) Be back in ten.

07:54.711 --> 07:57.563
- (Normal voice) Ho ho ho ho.
- Oh, good idea. I-I could use a break, too. (Chuckles)

07:57.598 --> 08:01.234
Yeah, you'll get a break.
It's called January to November.

08:01.268 --> 08:03.336
But I've been on my feet all day.

08:03.370 --> 08:05.571
You try walking around in these
pointy, uncomfortable shoes.

08:05.606 --> 08:07.473
Don't talk to me
about uncomfortable shoes.

08:07.507 --> 08:09.508
I didn't own a pair of shoes
till I was 12.

08:09.543 --> 08:12.311
My mother used to paint laces
on my socks,

08:12.346 --> 08:15.147
and nobody was fooled, by the way.

08:15.182 --> 08:16.616
All right, everybody, back to work.

08:16.650 --> 08:18.017
I want this place swept up

08:18.051 --> 08:21.254
and all the candy cane baskets
refilled by the time I get back.

08:21.288 --> 08:24.223
- All right? (Singsongy) Ho ho ho ho ho.
- That's not fair.

08:24.258 --> 08:27.243
Scrooge.

08:27.277 --> 08:29.061
Hey, you can't talk
to Santa like that.

08:29.096 --> 08:30.997
Um, he's not actually Santa Claus.

08:31.031 --> 08:31.998
What?!

08:32.032 --> 08:33.499
Nothing.

08:33.533 --> 08:35.501
Nothing.

08:35.534 --> 08:38.087
Look, just because we're playing
Santa's little helpers

08:38.121 --> 08:39.572
doesn't mean
we don't have any rights.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.207
Shh!
Don't make any trouble.

08:42.241 --> 08:44.677
He knows when we've been bad or good.

08:44.711 --> 08:46.212
Wait a second.

08:46.246 --> 08:49.548
We get paid, like, nothing--
no breaks, no benefits.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.750
But this is the way it's always been.

08:51.768 --> 08:56.255
You mean the way
it's always used to been.

08:57.257 --> 08:59.058
Ho ho ho ho ho ho.

08:59.092 --> 09:00.926
Okay, kiddies.

Come on, people.
Back to work.

09:28.621 --> 09:30.489

anything around here

09:30.524 --> 09:33.092

Sweet Mandy,
am I understanding right?

You're unionizing the elves?

Yes, Mr. Alzate.
We are all in this together.

It is no longer
every elf for his... elf.

09:50.510 --> 09:51.844
Well, thanks a lot, dad.

09:51.878 --> 09:54.246
I heard Ryan came by
your work to apologize,

09:54.281 --> 09:55.998
and you were mean to him?

09:56.033 --> 09:57.917
"Mean to him"? What's he, 6?

09:59.853 --> 10:01.954
I wasn't mean.
I was clear with him.

10:01.988 --> 10:04.156
And listen, I work
at a store filled with guns,

10:04.174 --> 10:05.524
and he left
with the same amount of holes

10:05.559 --> 10:08.327
he walked in there with.

10:08.345 --> 10:10.429
Look, he's trying to apologize,

10:10.464 --> 10:11.964
and he wants to see Boyd
for Christmas.

10:11.998 --> 10:13.666
You can't hold a grudge forever.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.134
Oh, yeah, I can.

10:15.168 --> 10:17.803
I'm still angry that those
hippies remade "true grit."

10:20.307 --> 10:21.640
Did you understand
anything they said?

10:21.674 --> 10:22.641
(Southern accent) "Sheriff,
what you doing over here?

10:22.676 --> 10:23.893
Come on now."

10:23.944 --> 10:25.677
(Speaks indistinctly in gruff voice)

10:25.696 --> 10:29.115
"That leg gonna have to come off."

10:30.183 --> 10:32.651
Dad, I was sort of thinking,
you know,

10:32.685 --> 10:34.686
you make everyone
go to church every week

10:34.705 --> 10:36.922
and listen to sermons
about forgiveness.

10:36.957 --> 10:38.524
So?

10:38.558 --> 10:41.827
So... maybe you should
just forgive Ryan.

10:41.861 --> 10:43.913
(Scoffs)

10:43.964 --> 10:47.366
<i>That's</i> what you take away
from church? Forgiveness?

10:47.384 --> 10:49.535
Wow.

10:49.569 --> 10:53.089
What about the vengeful God?
All that Isaiah stuff, huh?

10:53.140 --> 10:55.408
Rain toads on people.

10:55.442 --> 10:58.577
Rivers into blood,
harden the heart of the Pharaoh.

10:58.612 --> 11:02.882
How come <i>that</i> didn't sink in?
That's my God.

11:03.950 --> 11:05.818
Not mine.

11:15.635 --> 11:17.102
All right. <i>All right.</i>

11:17.136 --> 11:21.173
Nobody is leaving this room
until we get this worked out.

11:21.207 --> 11:22.908
Hmm?

11:27.113 --> 11:29.314
(Clears throat, sighs)

11:34.020 --> 11:36.471
I gotta go.

11:37.774 --> 11:39.224
(Door opens)

11:39.258 --> 11:42.561
I'm gonna write an offer
on a piece of paper,

11:42.595 --> 11:44.229
all right?

11:44.263 --> 11:46.465
And slide it to you.

11:46.499 --> 11:48.800
Why don't you just
tell me what it is?

11:48.835 --> 11:51.870
It's more dramatic like this.

11:56.242 --> 11:59.044
One free ham.

12:02.715 --> 12:03.915
(Clears throat)

12:03.949 --> 12:06.218
I don't think so.

12:06.252 --> 12:07.552
Worth a shot.

12:07.587 --> 12:10.388
Listen, Mr. Alzate,
you can't break us,

12:10.423 --> 12:12.224
so you might as well just give in.

12:12.258 --> 12:13.225
Well, we'll see about that.

12:13.259 --> 12:14.392
All right, what are your demands?

12:14.427 --> 12:16.845
Right, yes. Um, okay.

12:16.896 --> 12:18.230
- "Demand number one..."
- Mm.

12:18.264 --> 12:21.900
"We want a 5% cost-of-living
increase every 6 months."

12:21.934 --> 12:25.737
I see. You understand
your job ends in three days?

12:27.473 --> 12:30.075
I was not aware of that.

12:30.109 --> 12:32.811
All right. Next demand.

12:32.845 --> 12:34.496
Given this new information...
Mm-hmm.

12:34.530 --> 12:37.148
Some of these things
might not apply as much.

12:37.183 --> 12:38.617
- Mm-hmm.
- So, um...

12:38.651 --> 12:42.454
Clothing allowance,
company car, um...

12:42.488 --> 12:46.458
Okay, right, yes.
Uh, 10-minute break every hour.

12:46.492 --> 12:50.095
Ah. Well, in the spirit of
Christmas, I'll give you five.

12:50.129 --> 12:52.297
In the spirit of Christmas,
we'll take it.

12:52.331 --> 12:54.182
There you go.

12:54.217 --> 12:57.936
Yes! I just totally negotiated!
(Laughs)

12:59.004 --> 13:00.188
Well, we got to get back out.

13:00.223 --> 13:01.673
There are lots of kids waiting,
hundreds of kids.

13:01.707 --> 13:04.276
Oh, no. I'm exhausted.
I can't go through this no more.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.444
- And their moms.
- Let's go.

13:12.235 --> 13:13.702
Well, Boyd's crashed out.

13:13.736 --> 13:16.204
Dad, why would you let him have
an enormous chocolate reindeer

13:16.239 --> 13:17.789
an hour before dinner?

13:17.823 --> 13:20.909
In my defense,
I thought that thing was hollow.

13:21.928 --> 13:23.411
Kyle's here.

13:23.462 --> 13:25.863
He brought a plant.

13:25.882 --> 13:27.465
Hey, Mrs. B.
This is for you.

13:27.500 --> 13:32.220
Oh, thank you, Kyle. That is
very thoughtful and special.

13:34.507 --> 13:36.641
The gravy is congealing.
Let's eat.

13:36.676 --> 13:38.376
Come on, everybody. Eat.
Who wants to say grace?

13:38.394 --> 13:39.477
I will. Can I?

13:39.512 --> 13:40.762
- Sure.
- Yeah, sure, honey.

13:40.813 --> 13:42.213
- Well, that's quite a show.
- Wow. Isn't that ni--

13:42.231 --> 13:44.349
- Very nice.
- Mandy's gonna say grace.

13:44.383 --> 13:46.101
(Vanessa) Okay.
All right. I like that.

13:46.152 --> 13:47.118
- Hit it.
- Okay.

13:47.153 --> 13:48.153
Go ahead.
Ready? Okay.

13:48.187 --> 13:51.022
Dear lord, we are all so thankful

13:51.057 --> 13:53.658
to be gathered here
on this special day.

13:53.693 --> 13:55.026
And we're also thankful

13:55.061 --> 13:57.128
for the longer holiday hours
at the mall...

13:59.565 --> 14:01.733
For diet soda,

14:01.767 --> 14:05.337
and... for my beautiful skin
and for making me so popular.

14:05.371 --> 14:06.588
Okay, all right, all right,
all right, all right--

14:06.622 --> 14:08.273
- Amen. That was...
- (Mandy) Amen.

14:08.307 --> 14:09.841
Right from the heart.
That's nice.

14:09.875 --> 14:12.427
Uh, anybody else
want to say anything?

14:12.461 --> 14:13.845
Uh, actually,
I have something to say.

14:13.879 --> 14:16.348
- Great.
- (Vanessa) Okay. Go ahead, Kyle.

14:16.382 --> 14:19.584
(Sighs) Kristin,
you are super important to me...

14:19.602 --> 14:20.752
That's great.

14:20.770 --> 14:23.054
And I-I don't want to ever lose you,

14:23.089 --> 14:25.690
and that's why the following
thing is about to happen.

14:25.725 --> 14:27.592
What? Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

14:27.610 --> 14:29.694
Kristin Marie Baxter...

14:29.729 --> 14:31.863
Whose middle name's Beth.

14:34.266 --> 14:37.268
I know we've only known
each other a short time...

14:37.303 --> 14:38.570
No.

14:38.604 --> 14:40.705
Hang on. You don't know
where this is headed.

14:40.740 --> 14:42.941
Will you marry me?

14:47.013 --> 14:47.979
No.

14:48.014 --> 14:49.280
Oh. (Sighs)

14:51.500 --> 14:52.884
Um...

14:52.918 --> 14:54.419
I don't know what I'm supposed to do,

14:54.453 --> 14:57.305
'cause in my head,
we were already kissing.

14:57.340 --> 14:59.057
You know, we should--
we should go outside and talk.

14:59.091 --> 15:00.291
Just give us-- give us a minute?

15:00.309 --> 15:02.093
Oh, my God.
I have got to see this.

15:02.128 --> 15:03.595
This is gonna be so good, you know?

15:03.629 --> 15:06.297
Like one of those
Spanish soap operas...

15:06.332 --> 15:08.033
Where you can't understand
what they're saying,

15:08.067 --> 15:10.602
but everything's
really desperate and sad.

15:10.636 --> 15:11.970
(Doorbell rings)

15:12.004 --> 15:13.972
Hey, can anybody but me go get that?

15:14.006 --> 15:16.708
(Rings)

15:18.828 --> 15:22.247
Hi, Mrs. Baxter.
This is for you.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.551
Of course it is.

15:26.585 --> 15:28.787
What, uh, what are you doing here?

15:28.821 --> 15:30.922
I wanted to drop off
this Christmas gift for Boyd.

15:30.956 --> 15:32.674
(Mike) Who's at the door?

15:32.708 --> 15:34.826
(Stammers)

15:34.860 --> 15:38.229
I'm gonna ask you something,
and, uh, it--it--

15:38.264 --> 15:41.433
if it seems sarcastic,
it's not meant to be, but, uh,

15:41.467 --> 15:44.602
do you have a death wish?

15:44.637 --> 15:47.305
It's Christmas. I'm sure Mike
will be cool with me being here.

15:47.339 --> 15:49.524
- Yeah.
- Hey, honey, where's my carving knife?

15:49.558 --> 15:51.876
Uh, I...

15:51.911 --> 15:54.646
I-I-I don't know, sweetheart.
H-hang on.

15:54.680 --> 16:00.201
Uh, this might be a good time
to do what you do best--flee.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.421
Uh, Kyle, can you put that away?

16:03.456 --> 16:06.574
I just had to cancel
a balloon delivery.

16:07.927 --> 16:11.046
Okay, look, look, I-I get--
I get what's going on,

16:11.080 --> 16:12.063
but you shouldn't feel threatened

16:12.098 --> 16:13.832
just because Ryan's back in town.

16:13.866 --> 16:14.899
I shouldn't?

16:14.934 --> 16:16.034
No. No, no, no, look,

16:16.068 --> 16:18.470
I want him to be
a part of Boyd's life.

16:18.504 --> 16:20.839
Okay?
Not my life, Boyd's life.

16:21.907 --> 16:23.675
So what about us?

16:23.709 --> 16:25.777
I like that
we're taking things slowly.

16:25.811 --> 16:28.379
So keep the ring...

16:28.414 --> 16:29.714
For now.

16:29.749 --> 16:32.584
You know, I'd still like
a Christmas present, just...

16:32.618 --> 16:36.154
You know, something
a little less life-changing.

16:37.456 --> 16:41.076
I was gonna give this
coffee gift card to the mailman.

16:41.110 --> 16:43.411
See? This--this is perfect.

16:43.446 --> 16:44.612
(Kisses)

16:46.098 --> 16:48.433
They make smoothies, too.

16:50.436 --> 16:53.071
Ohh. I think we have to
go back in there.

16:54.123 --> 16:55.607
I'm a little embarrassed.

16:55.641 --> 16:58.126
Oh...
No one's gonna remember.

16:59.645 --> 17:01.713
The important thing

17:01.747 --> 17:04.799
is that you are my boyfriend,
and nobody is taking your place.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.252
(Door squeaks)

17:07.319 --> 17:08.920
Hey, Kris. What up?

17:10.138 --> 17:12.624
Uh, uh, surprise.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.492
Ryan's here?

17:14.527 --> 17:16.361
And he's sitting in my chair.

17:17.930 --> 17:21.432
And he's eaten all your porridge.

17:22.601 --> 17:24.868
Honey? The knife was
out by the sharpener.

17:24.904 --> 17:26.271
Yeah, I...

17:28.674 --> 17:30.275
I'm gonna go get the first aid Kit.

17:30.309 --> 17:32.911
Listen... what the hell?

17:32.945 --> 17:34.712
You show up at my place
of worship, then my job,

17:34.747 --> 17:35.880
now my house. What next?

17:35.915 --> 17:38.716
Trunk of my car?
Might not be a bad idea.

17:38.751 --> 17:41.820
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable.

17:41.854 --> 17:44.989
This from the guy who spends
half the year in a codpiece.

17:45.024 --> 17:47.892
Codpiece. That's funny.
How do you know about codpieces?

17:49.795 --> 17:51.646
Look, you have no reason to
believe I'll do the right thing,

17:51.680 --> 17:54.065
and if you tell me to leave now,
you won't ever see me again,

17:54.099 --> 17:56.818
but I'm just asking
for a little compassion...

17:56.852 --> 17:59.404
And maybe a little forgiveness.

18:00.472 --> 18:03.741
Jeez.

18:03.776 --> 18:07.245
"Forgiveness"--that word
keeps biting me in the ass.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.649
Hey, dad, remember
the Christmas truce story?

18:11.684 --> 18:13.084
What about it?

18:13.118 --> 18:14.385
The one you tell every year

18:14.420 --> 18:15.820
about the Germans and the French?

18:15.838 --> 18:16.988
I'm not telling that.

18:17.006 --> 18:18.173
It's German and the British,
by the way.

18:18.207 --> 18:19.591
Okay, well, I'm gonna tell.
Everybody sit down.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.993
Sit down.
Ryan, you sit over there.

18:22.011 --> 18:24.762
Everybody sit down. Okay.

18:25.764 --> 18:27.015
(Sighs)

18:27.049 --> 18:29.467
It was the winter of 1912.

18:29.501 --> 18:31.870
1914.

18:33.189 --> 18:35.056
1914...

18:35.107 --> 18:36.307
In France.

18:36.341 --> 18:37.842
Belgium.

18:37.877 --> 18:40.195
- I'll--sit down. I'll tell the story.
- Okay.

18:40.229 --> 18:43.114
It was, um, it was world war I--

18:43.148 --> 18:46.201
uh, trench warfare between
the Germans and the British,

18:46.235 --> 18:49.120
and it was particularly violent.
Thousands of men died.

18:49.154 --> 18:51.155
It was horrible fighting,
but one Christmas,

18:51.190 --> 18:54.659
these hated enemies decided
to, uh, exchange gifts,

18:54.693 --> 18:56.628
stop shooting each other.

18:56.662 --> 18:59.631
And, um, and they called it a...

18:59.665 --> 19:01.900
A Christmas truce.

19:01.934 --> 19:03.635
(Sighs)

19:06.272 --> 19:09.841
A lot of those soldiers had syphilis.

19:15.180 --> 19:18.616
So are you offering me a truce,
Mr. Baxter?

19:19.685 --> 19:21.286
Yes, I am.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.454
So, dad...

19:23.489 --> 19:25.023
Can he stay for dinner?

19:25.057 --> 19:28.559
So I g-- I guess he can, yeah.

19:28.594 --> 19:31.396
Cool.
Can I have a drumstick?

19:31.430 --> 19:34.999
Right away you gotta push it.
Right away you push it.

19:35.034 --> 19:36.668
I'll get a plate.

19:36.702 --> 19:39.587
Remember, the truce
only lasted 24 hours.

19:39.622 --> 19:41.706
Then they went back
to bayoneting each other.

19:43.542 --> 19:45.043
Thank you, dad.

19:45.077 --> 19:46.044
You're welcome.

19:46.078 --> 19:47.545
I'm proud of you. (Chuckles)

19:47.579 --> 19:50.515
See, this is what
Christmas is all about.

19:50.549 --> 19:52.100
So where's Boyd?

19:52.134 --> 19:55.119
Oh. My dad gave him a chocolate
reindeer, and he crashed out.

19:55.154 --> 19:58.489
Yeah, Mike, I'd really rather
he didn't have sugar.

20:00.392 --> 20:02.126
All right, you gotta go.
Mike.

20:02.161 --> 20:04.228
No, all right, all right,
I just--sit back down.

20:04.263 --> 20:05.663
(Door opens)

20:05.698 --> 20:08.032
- Hey, here we are.
