00:32.415 --> 00:40.515
You're nobody
'til somebody loves you

00:40.590 --> 00:45.721
You're nobody
'til somebody cares

00:47.897 --> 00:53.358
You may be king
You may possess the world

00:53.436 --> 00:55.996
And its gold

00:56.072 --> 00:59.337
But gold won't bring you
happiness

00:59.409 --> 01:03.675
When you're growin' old

01:03.746 --> 01:06.078
The world still is the same

01:06.149 --> 01:08.913
You never change it

01:11.020 --> 01:14.319
As sure as the stars

01:14.390 --> 01:17.848
Shine above

01:17.927 --> 01:25.663
You're nobody
'til somebody loves you

01:25.735 --> 01:30.934
So find yourself
somebody to love

02:03.673 --> 02:06.107
The world
still is the same

02:06.175 --> 02:10.475
You never change it

02:10.545 --> 02:14.380
As sure as the stars

02:14.450 --> 02:18.318
Shine above

02:18.388 --> 02:25.817
But you're nobody
'til somebody loves you

02:25.895 --> 02:33.109
So find yourself
somebody to love

02:37.924 --> 02:41.553
- Okay, so what if I don't want to give up on her?
- You don't call.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.620
- You said I don't call if I wanted to give up on her.
- Right.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.758
- So I don't call either way.
- Right.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.463
- So what's the difference?
- There is no difference right now.

02:51.538 --> 02:54.598
See, Mike, the only difference
between giving up and not giving up...

02:54.674 --> 02:57.302
is if you take her back
when she wants to come back.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.971
But you can't do anything
to make her want to come back.

03:00.046 --> 03:03.106
In fact, you can only do stuff
to make her not want to come back.

03:03.183 --> 03:07.017
So the only difference is if I forget about
her or just pretend to forget about her.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.954
- Right.
- Well, that sucks.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.685
Yeah, it sucks.

03:12.759 --> 03:17.059
So it's like a retroactive decision then?
I mean, I could, like, forget about her.

03:17.130 --> 03:20.463
And then when she comes back, make like
I just pretended to forget about her?

03:21.835 --> 03:25.100
Right, although probably
more likely the opposite.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.106
What do you mean?

03:27.174 --> 03:30.109
I mean, at first you're gonna pretend
to forget about her.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.611
Not call her,
I don't know, whatever.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.943
But then, eventually,
you really will forget about her.

03:35.015 --> 03:38.416
- Well, unless she comes back first.
- Mm, see, that's the thing.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.386
Somehow they know not to come back
until you really forget.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.717
- There's the rub.
- There's the rub.

03:50.797 --> 03:56.133
Look, man, uh, I-I'm sorry we always
talk about the same thing all the time.

03:56.203 --> 03:59.536
- Ah, no, it's all right.
- It's just that, you know... It's just you been there, man.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.904
- Don't sweat it.
- Your advice really helps. And I just, I don't know...

04:01.975 --> 04:05.741
You know, Rob, you're the only one
I can talk to about her.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.838
Thanks. Thanks, man.

04:11.651 --> 04:15.485
Hello, you have four messages.

04:15.555 --> 04:18.250
Message one.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.418
Hey, gorgeous,
it's, uh, Trent calling.

04:20.493 --> 04:23.690
Look, you gotta get that girl
out of your head. Uh, I hope my...

04:23.763 --> 04:26.527
Message two.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.592
Hey, Mike, uh, if you want
to talk about Michelle, give me...

04:29.669 --> 04:32.035
Message three.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.938
Did she call yet? I'm sure she...
- Message four.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.409
Michael, this is Grandma.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.878
We all miss you
back here in New York.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.882
You still haven't told me if you got
that part on the television pro...

04:43.950 --> 04:48.284
That was your last message.

04:50.023 --> 04:53.459
You have to put things in perspective.

04:53.526 --> 04:56.962
- I know, I know.
- She doesn't deserve you.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.964
Thanks. I appreciate that.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.466
There are plenty of fish
in the sea.

05:01.534 --> 05:03.900
Okay, that's great advice.
Thanks a lot. Okay? Bye.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.803
- Life, after all...
- Please, I'm trying to make a phone call.

05:06.873 --> 05:10.036
- Are you calling her?
- No. Will you stop? I'm try... Please.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.416
- Hello?
- What's up, Trent?

05:17.484 --> 05:20.578
Hey, we got two parties
tonight. One's for a modeling agency.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.589
- I don't know.
- Listen to me, baby. There's gonna be beautiful babies there.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.421
I... Look, Trent, uh,
I got shit to do tomorrow.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.428
Listen to you. I've got a final callback on
a pilot at 9:00, and I'm going to this thing.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.930
Come on, Mike, you got to get out
with the beautiful babies.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.762
- You can't sit at home thinking about it.
- Not tonight.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.428
Not tonight? Listen to you!
We're gonna have fun tonight.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.938
- We gotta get you out
of that stuffy apartment.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.100
We're gonna spend half the night driving
around the hills looking for this one party,

05:43.176 --> 05:45.610
and you're gonna say it sucks,
and we're all gonna leave,

05:45.679 --> 05:47.613
and then we're gonna go look
for this other party.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.945
But all the parties
and all the bars, they all suck.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.951
I spend half the night talkin' to some
girl who's lookin' around the room...

05:53.019 --> 05:56.113
to see if there's somebody else who's
more important she should be talking to.

05:56.189 --> 06:00.023
And it's like I'm supposed to be all
happy, uh, 'cause she's wearing a backpack.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.891
I... You know, and half of them
are just nasty skanks...

06:02.962 --> 06:06.693
who wouldn't be nothing, except they're
surrounded by a bunch of drunken, horny assholes.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.064
I'm gonna tell you something, T.
Are you listening?

06:09.135 --> 06:13.162
- Yeah, I'm listening.
- I'm not gonna be one of those assholes, all right?

06:13.239 --> 06:15.173
It just makes me sick.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.903
It's like, uh, some nasty skank who
isn't half the woman my girlfriend is...

06:17.977 --> 06:19.911
is gonna front me?

06:19.979 --> 06:21.913
- It makes me want to fuckin' puke.
- Jesus Christ!

06:21.981 --> 06:24.916
Will you shut up for a minute? We gotta
get you the fuck out of Dodge, man.

06:24.984 --> 06:28.317
- We're goin' to Vegas tonight.
- What are you talkin' about?

06:28.388 --> 06:31.915
- Vegas, baby. Vegas!
- What do you mean, Vegas?

06:31.991 --> 06:34.425
- Vegas. Las Vegas.
- I'm not going to no Vegas.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.691
Yeah. I think... You know what, man?
We're gonna go to Vegas and, uh...

06:37.764 --> 06:39.698
- When are we going to Vegas?
- We're going tonight.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.927
- No, we're not going tonight. I'm not going to Vegas!
- I'm gonna pick you up.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.731
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me. I'm not going, okay?

06:44.804 --> 06:48.604
- None of this shit anymore.
- Listen, I just listened to you; now hear me out.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.439
You bring something nice to wear.

06:51.511 --> 06:53.570
- I'm not going to Vegas.
- Mike, we're going.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.580
I'm not going to Vegas.

06:55.648 --> 06:59.948
All right, listen. I took out $300,
but I'm only betting with 100.

07:00.019 --> 07:03.182
I can't afford any more
than that, all right?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.486
And I figure if we buy a lot of chips,
though, the pit boss will see us,

07:05.558 --> 07:07.890
he'll comp us all sorts of free shit;
that's how it works over there.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.895
- But you gotta be cool.
- I'm cool, baby, I'm cool.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.989
They're gonna give Daddy a room,
some breakfast, maybe Bennett singing.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.591
- I know just the place.
- What the hell are you wearin'?

07:15.668 --> 07:17.602
I thought you said
we're gonna wear suits.

07:17.670 --> 07:20.468
Oh, Mike, you gotta stop worrying
about this. We're goin' to Vegas, man.

07:20.540 --> 07:24.067
If you're wearing a suit, and you look like
you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.374
It's in the back.
I'll put it on when we get there.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.641
Uh-uh. No way. No, turn around.
I'm goin' home.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.115
You gotta show up wearing that suit,
or otherwise I'm not going.

07:31.184 --> 07:35.120
All right already, okay? I'll put my
suit on. Grab the wheel. Hold it steady.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.588
- I'm tellin' you, this is how you do it.
- I know!

07:37.657 --> 07:40.353
- They're watching you when you drive up. That's how it works.
- Fine, fine.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.292
It could work.
I'm serious.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.830
They're gonna give Daddy
the Rain Man suite. You dig that?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.923
- We're going to Vegas, Mike. Vegas!
- Vegas!

07:47.000 --> 07:48.934
You think we can
get there by midnight?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.936
- We're gonna be up five "hundy" by midnight!
- Yeah!

07:51.004 --> 07:54.633
- Vegas! Vegas!
- Vegas, baby. Vegas!

08:00.180 --> 08:02.876
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

08:02.949 --> 08:07.818
'Cause I'm not the happy guy
I used to be

08:09.389 --> 08:12.381
She thinks I

08:12.459 --> 08:17.192
Still care

08:17.263 --> 08:21.199
But if she's happy thinking

08:21.267 --> 08:23.895
I still need her

08:27.407 --> 08:29.568
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.748
Vegas.

09:02.475 --> 09:05.376
It's the root of all evil
Of strife and upheaval

09:05.445 --> 09:08.278
But I'm certain, honey

09:09.716 --> 09:12.879
That life would be sunny

09:12.952 --> 09:16.786
With plenty of money

09:16.856 --> 09:20.883
And you

09:32.138 --> 09:34.572
I always thought, uh,
Caesar's was more the dope spot.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.076
Back in their day, this place was a real
contender, but now they'll appreciate the business.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.238
They'll probably fall all over themselves for
a couple of high-class guys like me and you.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.748
- Now, we're not...
- You want to be fresh on the scene, right?

09:43.816 --> 09:46.512
The new places down on the strip,
now, those places are supposed to be it.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.851
Oh, Mike, you don't want all that
fuckin' Pirate of the Caribbean horseshit.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.856
Or the rock and roll
grunge tip.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.586
You know, guys like me and
you gotta kick it here. Old school.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.924
Yeah, this is...
This is truly old school.

09:56.996 --> 10:00.989
- Definitely old school.
- This place is fuckin' dead.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.592
You know, I'm gonna find me two waitresses
here and I'm gonna pull me a Fredo.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.864
- Yeah, well, they're all skanks.
- What are you talkin' about?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.872
Look at all the
beautiful babies here.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.932
The beautiful babies don't work
midnights to 6:00 on a... on a Wednesday.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.979
- This is the skank shift.
- Look at all the beautiful honeys here.

10:14.046 --> 10:17.880
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, darling. I want you to remember this face here.

10:17.950 --> 10:21.818
This is the guy behind the guy
behind the guy.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.417
Okay.

10:26.492 --> 10:29.120
Will you cut that shit out?

10:29.195 --> 10:31.857
- What? She smiled.
- That's not cool, man.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.627
- Did she or did she not smile?
- It doesn't matter.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.760
- Mike, I'm telling you, girls love that stuff.
- You're gonna screw up our plan.

10:37.837 --> 10:41.466
- Baby, we're gonna get laid.
- Could we first see what happens when we play it cool?

10:41.540 --> 10:45.840
What do you think, Mike? Do you think she's
gonna leave us and go tell her pit boss on us?

10:45.911 --> 10:47.845
Will you stop makin' fun,
all right?

10:47.913 --> 10:51.314
The trick is we gotta look like we don't need
the shit, then they give us shit for free.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.978
Right, right, right.
Well, I think you look great, man.

10:54.053 --> 10:57.079
I think I'm looking like the money,
like the bomb, right?

10:57.156 --> 11:00.819
All right, stop. See that? That, uh,
table? That's where we make our scene.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.884
You think
they'll notice me and you?

11:02.962 --> 11:05.487
Oh, they're gonna notice me and you,
'cause they're watching.

11:05.631 --> 11:08.725
- Nicely done, sir. You're on a streak now.
- It's about time.

11:08.801 --> 11:13.261
One of the best streaks
I've ever had. I wanna get even.

11:17.176 --> 11:21.112
Uh, start with, uh,
I don't know, 300?

11:36.295 --> 11:39.355
I can count that
for you.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.366
- On the table.
- Excuse me?

11:41.434 --> 11:45.530
- You have to lay it on the table.
- I don't want to bet it all.

11:45.604 --> 11:47.538
You're not allowed
to hand me money, sir.

11:47.606 --> 11:50.803
You have to lay it on the table
if you want me to change it.

11:58.217 --> 12:02.119
- Changing 300.
- Three hundred.

12:09.795 --> 12:13.424
- Do you have anything smaller?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.764
But this happens to be
a $100 minimum bet table.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.430
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
at one of our lower stakes tables.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.866
Okay, just tuck 'em under,
just like this.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.878
There you go.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.140
Cocktails?

12:30.216 --> 12:32.343
Guy behind the guy.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.784
I'll have a scotch
on the rocks, please.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.516
Any scotch will do, as long
as it's not a blend, of course.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.525
Uh, single malt.
Glenlivet, Glenfiddich perhaps.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.618
Maybe a Glengow... Any Glen.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.129
Scotch on the rocks.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.575
- Double down.
- What?

13:07.653 --> 13:09.848
You got an 11.
You always double down on an 11.

13:09.922 --> 13:11.981
I know, but it's $200.
It's blood money.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.082
- Mike, you gotta double down.
- I can't double down.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.185
- Mike, if you don't look like you know what you're doing...
- Will you stop for a second?

13:16.262 --> 13:18.526
- Just shut up, okay? I can't.
- If you don't look like you know what you're doing...

13:18.597 --> 13:20.497
Just stop for a second!

13:23.135 --> 13:24.932
Double down.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.806
That's nice.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.809
Eighteen. Good. Eighteen's good.

13:36.849 --> 13:40.410
Twelve. Sixteen.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.149
Twenty-one.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.125
I'm telling you, baby,
you always double down on an 11.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.289
- Well, obviously not always.
- Always, baby.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.628
I'm just saying not
in this particular case.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.635
- You always double...
- I lost, okay? How could you say "always"?

13:57.703 --> 14:01.969
- Lady has 11. What would you like to do?
- Um, I hit.

14:02.041 --> 14:05.738
- Fifteen.
- I don't know what to do here.

14:05.811 --> 14:08.177
I'll hit again.

14:08.247 --> 14:10.181
Seventeen.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.744
Okay. I'll hit there. Okay.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.584
- Twenty-one.
- Oh, my gosh! Twenty-one!

14:17.656 --> 14:20.454
I got it!
Oh, my heavens. Thank you!

14:20.526 --> 14:22.517
Whee!

14:22.595 --> 14:25.393
Would you like to have some breakfast
this morning, ma'am?

14:25.464 --> 14:29.025
Oh, I really shouldn't. But then again,
it's a good idea. I'd love it.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.262
- Thank you so much!
- Why not? By all means.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.271
- Take this ticket in with you when you go in.
- Oh, thank you!

14:33.339 --> 14:35.273
- They'll fix you up.
- You'll fix me up.

14:38.677 --> 14:42.010
That went plenty nice, baby.
You're up 20 bucks.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.606
You know, I mean not counting
what happened on the first table.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.878
- Thanks for clarifying that.
- I'm down too, Mike.

14:46.952 --> 14:50.353
- Yeah? What'd you lose?
- I don't know what I dropped.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.788
Let's see, I dropped
probably 35 or...

14:52.858 --> 14:56.123
Don't give me that shit. You know
exactly what you lost. What'd you drop?

14:56.195 --> 14:59.790
Twenty, all right? But I was down at least
fifty. I'm sorry. I got lucky on the craps table.

14:59.865 --> 15:02.561
You shouldn't be sorry.
You're a winner. I'm the fuckin' loser.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.899
- I'm the one who should be sorry.
- Baby, don't talk that way.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.063
Could we just go, please?
Could we go?

15:07.139 --> 15:09.073
Baby, look at me. Look at me.

15:09.141 --> 15:12.076
You're money. And you know what else?
You're a big winner tonight.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.078
- I want to leave.
- You're a big winner.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.910
I'm gonna ask you a simple question,
and I want you to listen to me.

15:16.982 --> 15:21.248
Who's the big winner
here tonight at the casino? Huh?

15:21.320 --> 15:23.811
- Mikey, that's who. Mikey's the big winner.
- Okay.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.823
- Mikey wins.
- What a fuckin' asshole.

15:25.891 --> 15:28.758
Fine, I'm an asshole. But you know what?
You're the big winner tonight, Mikey.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.954
- You're the big winner in more ways than one.
- There you two are.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.431
I walked around for an hour
with that stupid scotch on my tray.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.968
We got knocked out pretty fast.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.266
- Ah, a couple of high rollers like yourself?
- Can you believe it?

15:39.338 --> 15:41.670
- I'm gonna get you that scotch.
- You know, forget about it.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.334
- I didn't even want it. I just wanted to order it.
- Can I get you something else?

15:44.410 --> 15:47.538
I mean, you really shouldn't leave
without getting something for free.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.547
Why ruin a perfect night?

15:49.615 --> 15:52.607
Listen, um, bring a single-malted,
uh, Glengarry for me...

15:52.685 --> 15:54.619
and one
for my boy Mikey here.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.747
And if you tell the bartender
to go easy on the water,

15:57.823 --> 16:02.226
then this 50-cent piece has your
name written all over it, okay?

16:02.294 --> 16:04.558
I want you to run along,
'cause I'll be timing you.

16:04.630 --> 16:09.158
I'm gonna keep time.
One, two, three, four.

16:09.234 --> 16:12.567
- What an asshole.
- Baby, that was money. Tell me that wasn't money.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.902
- That was so demeaning.
- She smiled, baby.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.909
- I can't believe what an asshole you are.
- No, baby, she smiled.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.912
- She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.574
- She was smiling at how money I was, what I did with her.
- Could we get out of here?

16:23.649 --> 16:26.584
- I'm not gonna pay for a room.
- Mike, what the hell do you want to get out of here for?

16:26.652 --> 16:29.086
- The honey baby's bringing us a cocktail.
- What, are you nuts?

16:29.154 --> 16:31.520
- You think she's coming back here?
- I know she's coming back.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.525
Did you hear what she said? "You shouldn't
leave without getting something for free."

16:34.593 --> 16:37.494
Baby, she wants to party.
She wants to.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.497
I'm tired. We should just go.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.693
Baby, this is what we came for. Now, we
met a beautiful baby, and she likes you.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.760
- She likes you.
- Whatever. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.001
Now, I don't care if I end up with her
or one of her beautiful baby friends.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.910
It's just I been... I been out
of the game for so long, man.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.939
- It's been like six years.
- Listen, it's hard, I know. I been there myself.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.551
Not for six years or anything,
but I've been there.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.085
Not for six years or anything,
but I've been there.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.748
The best thing you can do
is just get back out there.

17:04.823 --> 17:08.884
It's just I... I'm not attracted to them.
I keep thinking of my girlfriend.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.895
Then I'm trying to, like,
maintain a conversation with them.

17:11.963 --> 17:15.729
Mike, do you even think I know what the
hell they're saying to me half the time?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.233
I don't know if they're talking
about how hard it is to be adopted...

17:18.303 --> 17:20.737
or how their dad
can't show 'em affection.

17:20.805 --> 17:24.262
All I do, man, is stare at their mouth
and wrinkle my eyebrows,

17:24.342 --> 17:26.970
and somehow I turn out
to be a big sweetie, okay?

17:27.045 --> 17:30.572
Take this girl here.
She's a waitress in Las Vegas.

17:30.649 --> 17:34.585
But I bet somewhere inside of her
there is a very, very special dream.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.087
And no matter how hard I try, I won't...

17:37.155 --> 17:39.988
Hey, there she is, the most
special lady in town, right?

17:40.058 --> 17:42.424
- Yup.
- What time do you get off, uh, Christy?

17:42.494 --> 17:44.428
- 6:00.
- 6:00, great.

17:44.496 --> 17:47.863
- Two Glengarrys down, easy on the water.
- Fantastic.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.925
Uh, listen. Why don't you call a friend
and have her meet the three of us...

17:51.002 --> 17:53.527
- at the Bamboo Lounge at 6:01?
- You got it.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.665
- All right?
- Sure. Hey.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.507
That was so fuckin' money.
That was like the Jedi mind shit.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.379
See, that's what I'm trying to tell you,
baby. Girls love that kind of stuff.

18:05.450 --> 18:07.418
They don't go
for the sensitive shit.

18:07.485 --> 18:10.886
You start talking to 'em about, uh,
you know, puppy dogs and ice cream.

18:10.956 --> 18:14.392
They know what you want to do. What do you
think? You really think they don't know?

18:14.459 --> 18:17.223
- No. I know.
- They know what you want, baby. Believe me.

18:17.295 --> 18:19.729
When you pretend it's just
like a waste of their time.

18:19.798 --> 18:23.131
You're gonna take 'em that way
eventually, right? Don't apologize for it.

18:23.201 --> 18:27.103
It's just that I get this thing where I want
to be a gentleman and I wanna show respect.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.697
Oh, Mike.
Respect, my ass.

18:29.774 --> 18:31.799
What they respect is honesty.

18:31.876 --> 18:35.744
Look, you see how they dress when they go
out, right? They want you to notice 'em.

18:35.814 --> 18:39.011
All you're doin' is letting them know that
it's working. Get off this respect kick.

18:39.084 --> 18:42.053
There's nothing wrong with letting
the girls know that you're money...

18:42.120 --> 18:45.521
- and that you wanna party.
- You ready to order?

18:45.590 --> 18:48.616
Yeah. I'll have a coffee...
Two, uh, two coffees.

18:48.693 --> 18:51.321
And it says, uh, here,
"Breakfast anytime."

18:51.396 --> 18:53.762
That's right.

18:53.832 --> 18:57.632
I'll have the, uh, pancakes and the,
uh, age of enlightenment, please.

18:57.702 --> 19:00.296
And for you?

19:00.372 --> 19:04.832
Oh, um, let's see,
I'll have the, um, the Toucan.

19:04.909 --> 19:07.434
- Over easy.
- I'll be back with the coffee.

19:07.512 --> 19:09.707
All right, great.
Nice, baby.

19:09.781 --> 19:12.045
Renaissance.
It went over her head.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.711
I should have said renaissance.
Age of enlightenment. I...

19:14.786 --> 19:19.052
Oh, God! Like a Las Vegas waitress is gonna
get an obscure French philosophical reference?

19:19.124 --> 19:21.422
It's like I'm trying
to show off to her.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.360
I may as well have just said,
"Let me jump your ignorant bones."

19:24.429 --> 19:26.897
Don't even sweat her.
We're gonna meet our honeys soon.

19:26.965 --> 19:29.661
- You know Christy's friend is gonna be money.
- It's 20 to.

19:29.734 --> 19:33.067
- We gotta get out of here.
- Baby, will you relax just for a minute here?

19:33.138 --> 19:36.198
Excuse me. We have...
We're in a little bit of a hurry.

19:36.274 --> 19:38.208
Hang on, Voltaire.

19:50.255 --> 19:54.715
- I get paid for loving
- Hmm

19:54.793 --> 19:57.091
Loving all the time

19:59.364 --> 20:01.298
- How're you doin', guys?
- Hey, boys.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.926
- We almost gave up on you.
- I'm sorry we're late.

20:04.002 --> 20:07.096
- There's, uh, no clocks in this town anywhere.
- No harm done.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.106
- This is Lisa.
- Hi.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.608
- I'm sorry. I never got your name.
- I'm Mike.

20:11.676 --> 20:14.110
- Mike.
- This is Trent. We call him Double Down.

20:14.179 --> 20:16.113
- Trent.
- Stop right there.

20:16.181 --> 20:18.945
- Ladies, don't you always double down on an 11?
- Always.

20:19.017 --> 20:20.951
- No matter what. Like splitting aces.
- Whatever.

20:21.019 --> 20:23.647
- Hi, Lisa. I'm Trent. It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.656
Lovely, uh, make-up job
you have there.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.420
- Oh. Uh, Lisa works at the MGM Grand.
- I'm a Dorothy.

20:28.493 --> 20:31.291
Oh, Lisa's a Dorothy.
That's great. That's great.

20:32.897 --> 20:36.833
Well, we're not
in Kansas anymore.

20:40.705 --> 20:44.141
So, uh, what do
you guys do?

20:44.209 --> 20:46.769
Well, I'm a comedian.

20:51.549 --> 20:55.076
Um, do you ever play out here?
I'd love to see you sometime.

20:55.153 --> 20:57.087
- No.
- Why not?

20:57.155 --> 21:00.647
Well, there are, uh... You know,
it's just different circuits.

21:00.725 --> 21:03.660
- It's hard to explain. You wouldn't understand.
- Who's your booking agent?

21:03.728 --> 21:06.561
She... She knows...

21:06.631 --> 21:09.930
Actually, I don't have
West Coast representation as of yet.

21:10.001 --> 21:12.697
Oh, who's your representation
back East?

21:12.771 --> 21:16.935
I didn't... I sort of freelanced on
my own, kind of found my own things.

21:17.008 --> 21:19.306
- 'Cause I...
- So what do you do, Trent?

21:19.377 --> 21:22.346
- I'm a producer.
- Oh! Cool!

21:22.414 --> 21:24.348
That's great.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.680
I'm really
not supposed to drink here.

21:26.751 --> 21:31.313
We should go someplace else.
How's my place?

21:31.389 --> 21:33.619
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?

21:33.691 --> 21:36.626
- All right?
- Yeah, we... Yeah, sure.

21:36.694 --> 21:39.458
- Right.
- Because if you can't drink here...

21:39.531 --> 21:41.465
- Then you can't drink.
- Why not?

21:41.533 --> 21:44.468
- That'll be great.
- Okay, great. Let's go.

21:44.602 --> 21:47.594
You were in Acapulco Beach?

21:47.672 --> 21:50.163
We watch that all the time.

21:50.241 --> 21:53.404
- No, no, no, no, wait.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:53.478 --> 21:57.244
The worst was when I went in for
this Afterschool Special, right?

21:57.315 --> 21:59.545
So I'm sitting
in the waiting room,

21:59.617 --> 22:02.711
and there's all these little kids, uh,
sitting in the waiting room with me.

22:02.787 --> 22:05.688
And I see that all the kids are signed
in for the exact same role as me.

22:05.757 --> 22:08.658
- They're auditioning for the same role as you?
- Right.

22:08.726 --> 22:12.924
So, uh, I check the time and the place.
I'm where I'm supposed to be.

22:12.997 --> 22:16.831
I call my agent up. She says, "Trent,
they asked for you specifically."

22:16.901 --> 22:19.631
- What was the thing?
- I don't know what it was. It was "Drugs are Bad."

22:19.704 --> 22:22.434
"Jenny Eats Something." Whatever.
It's Afterschool Special bullshit.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.441
- Right.
- "Jenny Eats Something."

22:24.509 --> 22:28.275
The role I'm reading for is "brother."
I'm reading for the part of "brother."

22:28.346 --> 22:30.871
Big brother
or little brother?

22:30.949 --> 22:34.112
- Just brother, man. Just brother.
- No.

22:34.185 --> 22:36.949
Just brother, right? Finally I get
to go in and meet everyone, right?

22:37.021 --> 22:39.216
Mikey, I'm telling you,
I was money.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.485
It's a starring role.
I practiced for a week.

22:41.559 --> 22:45.290
So I'm reading with the casting director
and, girls, I literally start crying.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.297
- No.
- I swear to God.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.629
The casting director who's reading with
me kinda gets caught up in the vibe.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.635
- She starts crying.
- Oh!

22:51.703 --> 22:54.467
- Yeah, I swear to God. Swear to God.
- Wow.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.565
So now she's crying.
I'm crying.

22:57.642 --> 23:01.476
We're both kinda crying, but not
the kind of crying that's like...

23:01.546 --> 23:04.071
But the kind of crying that's
like we're trying not to cry.

23:04.148 --> 23:07.413
Do you know what I mean? Like we're not
trying to... Whatever. It was very cool.

23:07.485 --> 23:10.215
So I finished reading with her.

23:10.288 --> 23:13.086
I finally hold up my finger,
like give me a minute here.

23:13.157 --> 23:15.091
- Right.
- Like give me a minute.

23:15.159 --> 23:18.595
More than that, 'cause I'm in it.
But like I'm broke.

23:18.663 --> 23:22.759
Give me a second here.
May I have a minute?

23:22.834 --> 23:26.930
So I put down my head,
and the whole room sits in silence...

23:27.005 --> 23:28.939
for at least five minutes.

23:29.007 --> 23:30.941
- Swear to God, five minutes.
- Whoa!

23:31.009 --> 23:33.307
I look up, everyone
rips up in applause.

23:33.378 --> 23:37.109
The whole room is rip-roaring clapping
it up for me, for big T, right?

23:37.181 --> 23:41.811
Everyone in the room is sitting there tearing
their face. They're crying their eyes out.

23:41.886 --> 23:45.117
The guy working the camera, you know,
just filming it? Got tears in his eyes.

23:45.189 --> 23:48.124
- Not the camera guy.
- I swear to God, the camera guy.

23:48.192 --> 23:51.286
Not so much from my reading,
although it had a lot to do with it,

23:51.362 --> 23:53.489
but, really, he had
his own things going on.

23:53.565 --> 23:56.033
So the producer
starts to talk to me.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.898
He says, "Trent, when you
walked in this room,

23:58.970 --> 24:01.734
I didn't see Trent Walker
come in here."

24:01.806 --> 24:05.037
He said, "I saw big brother
come in here." Fuckin' great, right?

24:05.109 --> 24:07.703
He says, "You walked in with the role,
you nailed it, you're great."

24:07.779 --> 24:10.612
- So give me the fuckin' part.
- Exactly. Right?

24:10.682 --> 24:15.585
Then he says to me... He says,
"Trent, I gotta be honest with you.

24:15.653 --> 24:19.749
I think that it might be that
you may be just a little bit old...

24:19.824 --> 24:22.315
for the role of brother."

24:22.393 --> 24:24.918
So I felt confident,
'cause I gave a good read.

24:24.996 --> 24:27.931
I say to him, "Well, how old exactly
is the role of brother?"

24:27.999 --> 24:29.933
- Here it comes.
- 'Cause I'm tall.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.435
- Here it comes.
- But I look young, Mike. Do I look young, girls?

24:32.503 --> 24:34.528
Yeah, you do.

24:34.606 --> 24:37.598
So he says to me... I swear to God he
says this to me with a straight face.

24:37.675 --> 24:41.812
This fucking guy.
"Eleven years old."

24:41.945 --> 24:43.879
- And you said "double down."
- Double down.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.246
Because you know why? Because you
make it happen on the bets.

24:46.316 --> 24:48.250
He's great, isn't he?

24:48.318 --> 24:51.776
But the truth of the matter was,
you saw my picture, you saw my tape.

24:51.855 --> 24:54.653
You know I'm 24 years old.
Why did you call me in?

24:54.724 --> 24:57.420
- Wow.
- That's your great bit.

24:57.494 --> 25:01.260
Well, we all have stories.

25:01.331 --> 25:03.265
- Wow.
- Yup.

25:10.807 --> 25:16.143
Uh, how rude of me. I never...
I never gave you the... the tour.

25:37.734 --> 25:42.330
Come on home, girl
He said with a smile

25:42.405 --> 25:46.739
You don't have to love me
and let's get high a while

25:46.810 --> 25:51.611
But try to understand
Try to understand

25:51.681 --> 25:54.707
- Ohh
- I'm gonna check on my boy.

25:54.784 --> 25:58.117
Ohh, try

25:58.188 --> 26:00.281
Try to understand

26:00.357 --> 26:04.487
Try, try
Try to understand

26:04.561 --> 26:07.257
He's a magic man

26:13.236 --> 26:15.261
I'm sure she'll call.

26:15.338 --> 26:17.568
I mean, six years
is a long time.

26:17.641 --> 26:20.735
- You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
- But she did.

26:20.810 --> 26:23.745
- And she's with somebody else now.
- Already?

26:23.813 --> 26:26.976
- Yeah.
- Oh, you poor thing.

26:27.050 --> 26:29.746
- You know what? It won't last.
- Why not?

26:29.819 --> 26:33.755
- It's a rebound.
- We were a rebound and we lasted for six years.

26:33.823 --> 26:39.056
Well, yeah, but how long was the
relationship she was rebounding from?

26:39.129 --> 26:41.757
Six years.

26:41.831 --> 26:44.265
Uh, can I check
my messages real quick?

26:44.334 --> 26:47.269
- I have a calling card. It won't cost anything.
- Yeah.

26:47.337 --> 26:49.601
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, sure. The phone's in the back.

26:49.673 --> 26:52.107
- I'm not ruining tonight, am I?
- No, it's okay.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.268
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Oh, I understand.

26:54.344 --> 26:56.278
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.854
T.

27:06.923 --> 27:08.857
Trent.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.461
Trent.

27:13.530 --> 27:16.226
I need to, uh, u...

27:16.299 --> 27:21.498
No. I gotta... I gotta use...
I gotta use the phone.

27:21.571 --> 27:25.667
- You can check 'em tomorrow.
- I need to use the phone.

27:25.742 --> 27:28.575
Okay? I'm sorry.

27:28.645 --> 27:30.579
Hold on.

27:33.216 --> 27:36.413
I'm sure I... They weren't
in there that long.

27:36.486 --> 27:39.580
I don't think we're
interrupting anything.

27:46.496 --> 27:48.430
I have a calling card.

27:48.498 --> 27:52.229
So it's a 800...
it's a 800 number.

28:05.915 --> 28:09.874
- Six years? Oh, poor thing.
- I know.

28:09.953 --> 28:11.887
- And you know what he said?
- What? What?

28:11.955 --> 28:13.889
- And I believe him.
- What?

28:13.957 --> 28:17.893
- He said, "I just want her to be happy."
- He said that?

28:17.961 --> 28:20.794
- It's so sweet. So sweet.
- That is so sweet.

28:20.864 --> 28:23.230
- Oh.
- I know.

28:23.299 --> 28:26.291
I'll make some coffee.

28:26.369 --> 28:29.065
Mmm.

28:49.793 --> 28:51.556
Did she call?

28:53.029 --> 28:57.056
- Oh!
- Oh, Mike, I'm so...

28:57.133 --> 28:59.829
Oh, God.

28:59.903 --> 29:03.532
That's so bad. I'm sorry.

29:04.741 --> 29:07.835
It's gonna be okay.

29:07.911 --> 29:12.041
She asked me what I was thinking about.
Did you want me to lie?

29:12.115 --> 29:15.209
You didn't have to
get into it, baby.

29:15.285 --> 29:17.378
I'm sorry about
interrupting you guys.

29:17.454 --> 29:20.981
Oh, don't worry about it. I just wanted
you to have a good time, that's all.

29:21.057 --> 29:24.959
- Christy was nice.
- Yeah, I really didn't like her that much, to be honest.

29:25.028 --> 29:28.987
- Why not?
- I don't know, man. She just... She didn't really do it for me.

29:29.065 --> 29:34.002
What'd you think of that,
uh, Dorothy girl?

29:34.070 --> 29:37.062
The whole Judy Garland thing
kinda turned me on.

29:37.140 --> 29:40.735
- Does that make me some kind of a fag?
- No, baby, you're money.

29:44.314 --> 29:47.750
- I don't think she liked me anyway.
- Mike, I'm tellin' you, man.

29:47.817 --> 29:50.911
- She thought you were money.
- I don't think so.

29:50.987 --> 29:54.081
I heard 'em both talking.
Both those girls thought you were money.

29:54.157 --> 29:56.751
You're a good friend.

29:58.128 --> 30:01.097
Look, you take yourself
outta the game.

30:01.164 --> 30:03.758
You start talkin' to 'em
about puppy dogs and ice cream,

30:03.833 --> 30:07.030
of course it's going to end up
on the friendship tip.

30:07.103 --> 30:09.037
I just don't think
she liked me in that way.

30:09.105 --> 30:11.869
Baby, you are so money,
and you don't even know it.

30:11.941 --> 30:16.435
Look, T, the girls don't go for me
the way they go for you, okay?

30:16.513 --> 30:18.913
- Michelle went for you, right?
- That's different.

30:18.982 --> 30:21.951
- Why? How is that different?
- We were younger. It was college.

30:22.018 --> 30:24.953
You didn't go to college. You don't know
how it is. The girls are young, they drink.

30:25.021 --> 30:28.957
- They don't know any better.
- Do you know how stupid that sounds?

30:29.025 --> 30:33.962
Listen to me. Your self-esteem is low
right now because she's with somebody else.

30:34.030 --> 30:37.796
But talkin' about it and thinkin' about
it all the time, it's depressing.

30:37.867 --> 30:41.359
It's no good, man.

30:41.437 --> 30:43.371
I just need
a little more time.

30:43.439 --> 30:46.567
Why, so you can sit around your stuffy
apartment beating yourself up over it?

30:46.643 --> 30:50.409
- Remember the first week after she told you?
- Don't remind me.

30:50.480 --> 30:54.541
Huh? Couldn't even
leave your place.

30:54.617 --> 30:57.745
You know, you just sat around
your stuffy apartment,

30:57.820 --> 31:01.654
sitting there, drinking orange juice,
feeling sorry for yourself.

31:01.724 --> 31:05.091
Now look at you, man. Right?
I mean, you got a part in a movie.

31:05.161 --> 31:07.755
- A day.
- Whatever, Mike. It's work. You understand?

31:07.830 --> 31:12.199
You're doing what you love to do.
What the hell is she doing now?

31:12.268 --> 31:15.260
Selling scrap metal.

31:15.338 --> 31:18.671
Okay. And this guy she's seeing,
what the hell does he do?

31:18.741 --> 31:21.232
- He drives a carriage.
- What?

31:21.311 --> 31:24.872
I heard he drives a carriage
around Central Park or something.

31:24.948 --> 31:28.884
Oh, Mike, please! You're
the fun-lovin', outgoing party guy,

31:28.952 --> 31:31.881
and you're sweatin'
some lawn jockey.

31:31.954 --> 31:34.923
Jesus Christ!
I'm tellin' you, man.

31:34.991 --> 31:38.722
You're better off without this girl.
You gotta trust me on this, Mike.

31:38.795 --> 31:42.287
- All right, buddy?
- Stop talking. Shut up.

31:42.365 --> 31:46.529
Okay, I'm gonna try. I promise you I
will shut up if you shut the hell up.

31:46.602 --> 31:49.537
- We're gonna make this work.
- You're damn right you're gonna try.

31:49.605 --> 31:52.472
Let's get home.

31:52.542 --> 31:56.740
- I'm a man of means by no means
- Los Angeles.

31:56.813 --> 31:59.111
King of the road

31:59.182 --> 32:03.846
I know every engineer
of every train

32:03.920 --> 32:07.219
All their children
and all of their names

32:07.290 --> 32:11.317
And every handout
in every town

32:11.394 --> 32:15.057
Every lock that ain't locked
when no one's around

32:15.231 --> 32:18.166
I seen trailers
for sale or rent

32:18.234 --> 32:20.600
- I don't think I'm gonna take it.
- Look, it's a gig.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.604
This is definitely
a step back for me.

32:22.672 --> 32:25.106
There's not much of a call
for Shakespeare in this town.

32:25.174 --> 32:27.608
There's just something
about being Goofy, all right?

32:27.677 --> 32:31.511
Any other Disney character would
be fine. Mickey? Mickey's an icon.

32:31.581 --> 32:34.948
- Why does it have to be Goofy?
- What do you want? You're tall.

32:35.017 --> 32:37.611
How am I gonna
tell my parents?

32:37.687 --> 32:40.383
I still haven't told them
I didn't get the series.

32:40.456 --> 32:42.947
You tested over a month ago.
I'm sure they figured it out.

32:43.025 --> 32:46.620
It's like, "Mom, hi.
I didn't get that pilot.

32:46.696 --> 32:50.325
By the way, I'm Goofy.
Send more money."

33:09.919 --> 33:11.853
Hey, Rob.

33:13.289 --> 33:16.315
You notice I didn't
mention her once today.

33:16.392 --> 33:20.021
- I didn't want to say anything.
- Oh, yeah? Why?

33:20.096 --> 33:23.827
Ah, it's kind of like not talking to
your pitcher in the middle of a no-hitter.

33:23.900 --> 33:27.392
- What do you mean? Like you didn't want to jinx it?
- Kinda.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.938
I don't talk about her that much.

33:30.006 --> 33:32.440
- I didn't mention her once today.
- Tend the pin.

33:32.508 --> 33:35.602
The only reason I mentioned her at all was to
tell you I'm not gonna talk about her anymore.

33:35.678 --> 33:38.374
- I thought you'd appreciate that.
- I do. Good for you, Mikey.

33:41.684 --> 33:44.118
- Get there.
- Play it out.

33:44.187 --> 33:47.850
- I decided to get back out there.
- Good. Glad to hear it.

33:47.924 --> 33:51.451
- Can't make any more excuses for myself.
- Excellent.

33:53.296 --> 33:56.129
Do you wanna hit the town tonight?

33:56.199 --> 33:59.362
Uh, I shouldn't.
It's a weeknight.

33:59.435 --> 34:04.134
- You got a Pluto callback?
- Yeah, kick me when I'm down.

34:04.207 --> 34:07.176
- All right. Count 'em up.
- How many strokes?

34:07.243 --> 34:09.574
One, two, three...

34:13.983 --> 34:15.917
- Eight, nine.
- What'd you get?

34:15.985 --> 34:18.418
- Eight or a nine.
- I'll give you an eight.

34:18.487 --> 34:20.819
- What did you get?
- I got an eight.

34:20.889 --> 34:24.257
Dead heat after one hole.
It's turning into quite a rivalry.

34:24.327 --> 34:27.853
You better replace the pin, Chi Chi.
The natives look restless.

34:29.565 --> 34:31.760
You bitch! You bitch!

34:31.833 --> 34:34.428
Chelios steals to Roenick.

34:34.503 --> 34:36.766
- Money!
- Bitch!

34:36.839 --> 34:38.931
Sue, why is
Gretzky on his ass again?

34:39.007 --> 34:42.603
- Gretzky's a little bitch.
- God, this is such bullshit, man. This is bullshit!

34:42.678 --> 34:45.476
The Kings suck in this game.
You should play another team.

34:45.547 --> 34:48.949
- I took the Kings to the Cup.
- Yeah, against the computer with the offsides off.

34:49.018 --> 34:52.112
- They're a finesse team, bro.
- They're a fuckin' bitch team. Score... Oh!

34:52.188 --> 34:54.782
You bitch!
What a fuckin' bitch!

34:54.857 --> 34:56.916
- Watch out, motherfucker.
- No, you do not fuckin' hit my elbow.

34:56.993 --> 34:59.484
It's not even so much me
as it's Roenick. He's good.

34:59.562 --> 35:01.427
Oh, is that right?

35:01.497 --> 35:03.965
- Chelios steals to Roenick.
- You bitch!

35:04.033 --> 35:06.433
Score Chicago! Ohh!

35:06.502 --> 35:08.436
- That was pretty.
- Such fuckin' bullshit!

35:08.504 --> 35:11.064
But that was pretty, Sue.
Check this out on the instant replay.

35:11.140 --> 35:13.506
- Dude, do not...
- You said it was fuckin' bullshit. Check it out.

35:13.576 --> 35:16.374
Look at it!

35:16.445 --> 35:18.379
- Look at it!
- I don't want to!

35:18.447 --> 35:21.507
Why do you think they put
the instant replay in the fucking game?

35:21.584 --> 35:23.984
- God, you're unbelievable.
- So you can see if it's bullshit.

35:24.053 --> 35:27.853
- I am unbelievable. Look at it.
- Every goal you're gonna watch the instant replay?

35:27.924 --> 35:29.858
- Come on, man, I want to fuckin' play.
- I want him to learn it.

35:29.926 --> 35:31.917
- I never get to play.
- You should practice this when I'm not here.

35:31.994 --> 35:34.428
- Just fuckin' move it.
- When I'm not here, will you practice this?

35:34.497 --> 35:36.590
- Wa, wa, wa, wa.
- We'll play some more. He likes to get scored on.

35:36.666 --> 35:38.759
- Set the game up.
- Great times.

35:42.338 --> 35:44.431
- Yeah?
- Better play defense.

35:44.507 --> 35:47.601
Okay. Yeah, it's on the fourth floor.
The elevator's broken, okay?

35:47.677 --> 35:50.111
Dude, it's Pink Dot.
Would you buzz him in? Hit nine.

35:50.179 --> 35:52.943
I wish they still had fights in
this game so I could bitch-slap Wayne.

35:53.015 --> 35:55.347
- They don't have fighting anymore?
- Doesn't that suck?

35:55.418 --> 35:57.750
Why'd they get rid of the fighting?
It's the best part of the old version.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.845
Kids were hitting each other
or something, man.

35:59.922 --> 36:02.186
But you know what, Mike? You can
make their heads bleed on this one.

36:02.258 --> 36:04.419
- Make somebody's head bleed.
- No, we're in play-offs.

36:04.493 --> 36:07.724
I'm gonna make Wayne Gretzky's head
bleed for super fan number 99 here.

36:07.797 --> 36:10.493
Mikey, get the door?

36:10.566 --> 36:12.761
- Yeah, give me some money.
- Why do I have to give you money?

36:12.835 --> 36:15.599
Give me some fuckin' money.
I'm not paying again.

36:15.671 --> 36:18.367
Jesus Christ.
Pause the game.

36:18.441 --> 36:21.239
- Dude, I'm about to do my thing with the thing.
- Pause the game!

36:21.310 --> 36:23.244
- I got fuckin' Wayne.
- Pause it!

36:23.312 --> 36:26.748
All right, I'll pause it.
Jesus Christ. Like you scored all day.

36:28.250 --> 36:30.411
- How much do you want?
- Just give me some money.

36:30.486 --> 36:34.320
Okay, fine. Take my last 20.
Here. Jesus fucking Christ.

36:36.092 --> 36:38.720
There it is, Mikey! Check it out.
His head's bleeding.

36:38.794 --> 36:41.888
Mikey, check it out. His legs... Little
Wayne's legs are shaking all over.

36:41.964 --> 36:45.331
- Fucking bitch! What did you do that for?
- You're the fucking bitch!

36:45.401 --> 36:48.598
- What the fuck are you... Why did
you un-pause it? - Come on, man.

36:48.671 --> 36:51.265
- C'mon, peaches.
- Get the fuck off me.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.934
- I'm not kidding.
- You know what? Look at you. Look at you.

36:54.010 --> 36:56.069
- You wanna kiss me. Look at you.
- Get the fuck off.

36:56.145 --> 36:58.079
- Get off!
- Look at you right now.

36:58.147 --> 37:00.809
- Get the fuck off me!
- You're fuckin' makin' me sick! You want to kiss me!

37:00.883 --> 37:05.149
Hey, hold still. Hold on. It's
the fuckin' Pink Dot guy. Hold on.

37:05.221 --> 37:08.657
Hey, Mikey! Mikey, is he cute?

37:08.724 --> 37:11.750
- Is he brown?
- Maybe he'd like to come in and join us for a cocktail.

37:11.827 --> 37:13.761
- Is he polite?
- Is he a brown man?

37:13.829 --> 37:16.730
If he's polite, have him come in. If
he's polite, let him in. Is he clean?

37:16.799 --> 37:19.893
Have him come look.
Have him take off his shoes.

37:19.969 --> 37:22.233
Michael, is he clean?
I want to see him!

37:22.304 --> 37:26.138
Michael, I want to see him.
Don't let him go! Don't let him go.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.733
Get off. I'm serious.
Don't fuckin' do that shit.

37:28.811 --> 37:32.076
Oh, he got away from us.
I'm sorry, Michael. Was he nice?

37:32.148 --> 37:37.245
You guys are assholes.
Eat, eat, you fuckin' jackals.

37:37.319 --> 37:39.480
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice.

37:39.555 --> 37:41.921
- What time is the party tonight?
- It starts at 8:00.

37:41.991 --> 37:44.585
- Everybody'll get there around 10:00.
- So, what, 11:00?

37:44.660 --> 37:46.855
- Midnight.
- Midnight.

37:46.929 --> 37:50.626
I'm gonna bring an old friend
from back home. He just moved out here.

37:50.699 --> 37:52.633
- Who, Rob?
- Yeah, you know him.

37:52.701 --> 37:55.135
Yeah, he's cool.
You'll like him. He's a rounder, Rob.

37:55.204 --> 37:57.434
- What does he do?
- Uh, he's trying to be an actor.

37:57.506 --> 37:59.770
- What a surprise.
- How novel.

37:59.842 --> 38:03.369
So the party started at 8:00.

38:03.446 --> 38:05.880
Why are we going
to a bar at 10:00?

38:05.948 --> 38:09.475
To grab a drink before we meet
the guys for a bite at 11:00.

38:09.552 --> 38:11.486
Where is this place?

38:11.554 --> 38:15.354
For some reason the cool bars in Hollywood
have to be hard to find and have no sign.

38:15.424 --> 38:18.052
It's kind of like a speakeasy
kind of thing. It's kinda cool.

38:18.127 --> 38:20.960
It's like you're in on some
kind of secret, you know?

38:21.030 --> 38:25.023
You tell a chick you been someplace, it's
like braggin' that you know how to find it.

38:39.815 --> 38:48.118
Excuse me.

38:51.994 --> 38:54.929
I'll get a Dewars on the rocks.
What are you getting?

38:54.997 --> 38:57.932
- Uh, Budweiser.
- A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.527
God, I can't believe
the women in this city.

39:01.603 --> 39:05.403
It's like the hottest one percent
from... from all over the world...

39:05.474 --> 39:07.408
come to our gene pool.

39:07.476 --> 39:09.410
Darwinism at its best.

39:09.478 --> 39:12.447
- Yo, Mikey, what's up?
- Charles! How you doin', man?

39:12.514 --> 39:15.005
- Ah, you know, man. You know.
- You get that pilot?

39:15.083 --> 39:18.280
Nah, man. I know you didn't. Otherwise
you wouldn't be askin' me, right?

39:18.353 --> 39:21.720
- That shit wasn't funny anyway.
- Piece of shit.

39:21.790 --> 39:25.157
Charles, this is my friend Rob
from back East. He just moved out here.

39:25.227 --> 39:27.161
- My pleasure.
- How you doin', man?

39:27.229 --> 39:29.561
This is Charles.
We went to network on a pilot.

39:29.631 --> 39:31.895
- Oh, yeah, I tested for one.
- A month ago.

39:31.967 --> 39:35.459
- How'd your folks take it?
- Actually, I haven't heard an official "no" yet.

39:35.537 --> 39:38.028
Oh, so you haven't
told them yet.

39:38.106 --> 39:41.234
That's all right, man. I still haven't
told my folks I didn't get Deep Space Nine.

39:41.310 --> 39:43.244
You figure they'd figure
it out by now, right?

39:43.312 --> 39:45.644
- But Moms keeps asking me.
- Boy, does it hurt when they ask.

39:45.714 --> 39:47.944
I don't even tell them about
anything I'm close on anymore.

39:48.016 --> 39:50.246
Not 'til you book it.
You know, you might get cut out.

39:50.319 --> 39:53.982
I'm considering taking
a part as Goofy.

39:54.056 --> 39:56.991
- Well, at least it's Disney, right?
- Yeah.

39:57.059 --> 40:00.085
Look, we're going to, uh,
we're going to this party in the hills.

40:00.162 --> 40:03.222
Some modeling agency. Beautiful babies.
You want to come with?

40:03.298 --> 40:05.960
Yeah, why not?
This place is dead anyway.

40:06.034 --> 40:08.229
Let's go.

40:11.807 --> 40:14.105
No, no, no, no, no.
Now, you got to admit...

40:14.176 --> 40:16.667
that the Steadicam shot
in GoodFellas was the money.

40:16.745 --> 40:20.112
The basement of the... the restaurant,
the Copa in New York.

40:20.182 --> 40:23.117
- Through the kitchen, Mike.
- I heard it took them four days to light that shot.

40:23.185 --> 40:25.119
Four days?
I don't know about four days.

40:25.187 --> 40:27.280
- Well, that's what I heard.
- They have to hide all the lights.

40:27.356 --> 40:29.290
Jesus, that must've
cost a fortune.

40:29.358 --> 40:32.293
That's nothing. You know how much
money my man spent on that Vegas movie?

40:32.361 --> 40:34.295
Wait. You gotta be nuts
to shoot in a casino.

40:34.363 --> 40:36.456
All right, ready. Mean Streets?

40:36.531 --> 40:39.694
- That's the dope.
- Dude, dude. Reservoir Dogs.

40:39.768 --> 40:41.793
- Oh, stop with that fucking Reservoir Dogs.
- Which one?

40:41.870 --> 40:44.430
The one right in the beginning where
they're walking in slow motion, man.

40:44.506 --> 40:46.633
How can you even
compare the two, man?

40:46.708 --> 40:49.302
Tarantino completely bites
everything from Scorsese.

40:49.378 --> 40:51.312
- It's true.
- He's derivative.

40:51.380 --> 40:53.644
You know what?
You gotta admit that did look money.

40:53.715 --> 40:56.775
I heard they did
that whole thing for under ten grand.

40:56.852 --> 40:58.979
I don't know what the big deal is. Everybody
steals from everybody. That's movies.

40:59.054 --> 41:01.147
Let's get the hell out
of here if we wanna make this party.

41:41.496 --> 41:43.794
Pick up the pieces
Uh-huh

41:43.865 --> 41:45.890
Pick up the pieces
All right

41:45.968 --> 41:50.431
Pick up the pieces

42:15.831 --> 42:17.765
Whoo

42:43.458 --> 42:45.949
Pick up the pieces

42:48.130 --> 42:55.497
Pick up the pieces

43:03.578 --> 43:06.638
Uhh
Oh, suki, suki

43:08.417 --> 43:12.581
Hey
Uhh, come on

43:12.654 --> 43:16.920
- How you been? Good to see you.
- Hey, good to see you.

43:16.992 --> 43:19.426
- So who threw this party anyway?
- Damned if I know.

43:19.494 --> 43:22.088
- Beats me.
- Hey, I came with you.

43:22.164 --> 43:24.223
Nice.

43:24.299 --> 43:27.427
- Sue!
- What's that guy's name again? Sue?

43:27.502 --> 43:30.903
Sue. Yeah. His dad was a big Johnny Cash
fan from what I understand.

43:30.972 --> 43:33.566
- Oh, right, right, right. The song.
- Yeah, "A Boy Named Sue."

43:33.642 --> 43:36.509
So I think that's why
he's such a mean cat.

43:36.578 --> 43:38.512
- That guy?
- Oh, he's a bad guy.

43:38.580 --> 43:41.276
He don't look it. He's... No, he's mean.
I seen him in a fight once.

43:41.349 --> 43:44.944
He had a guy and was fuckin' smackin'
his head into the curb, like his mouth.

43:45.020 --> 43:48.456
Just fuckin' smash. His teeth came out.
Just fucking, wha, wha, wha.

43:48.523 --> 43:51.287
Fuckin' blood came out of
his fuckin' mouth. It was nasty, man.

43:51.359 --> 43:53.987
- Nice guy, though. That guy's cool.
- Hey, big Mike.

43:54.062 --> 43:56.997
Hey, how're you doing?
What are you doing here?

43:57.065 --> 43:59.397
- Marty invited me here.
- Oh, yeah? Cool, cool.

43:59.468 --> 44:02.494
Thrill me, baby
I need you

44:02.571 --> 44:06.098
- She looking at me now?
- No.

44:07.742 --> 44:11.178
- How 'bout now? Is she looking over here now?
- No.

44:15.984 --> 44:19.249
What about now?
Is she looking now?

44:19.321 --> 44:22.085
No, she's not looking at you, dude. Will
you quit asking me if she's looking at you?

44:22.157 --> 44:26.423
- She hasn't looked at you... Wait, she just looked.
- See what I'm sayin', man?

44:26.495 --> 44:29.487
You understand?

44:29.564 --> 44:31.930
I got some friends I wanna go meet.
I'll talk to you later.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.093
- Nice to see you. I'll give you a call.
- All right. Take care.

44:34.169 --> 44:36.103
- All right, man.
- Who's that?

44:36.171 --> 44:38.366
I don't know, man.

44:43.011 --> 44:45.946
- You know, there's so many beautiful women.
- Unbelievable, dude.

44:46.014 --> 44:49.108
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, I gotta try once.

44:49.184 --> 44:51.277
- You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
- I have to.

44:51.353 --> 44:53.287
- I made a promise to myself.
- Go. Go for it.

44:53.355 --> 44:55.949
I have to get out there sooner
or later, right? So I gotta go now.

44:56.024 --> 44:59.118
- Okay, you're gonna be my wing man?
- I'll be your winger.

45:13.875 --> 45:16.241
Hi. Uh, how are you ladies
doing this evening?

45:17.946 --> 45:20.437
What do you drive?

45:20.515 --> 45:22.745
E- Excuse me?

45:22.817 --> 45:26.082
What kind of a car
do you drive?

45:26.154 --> 45:28.588
Uh, Cavalier.

45:28.657 --> 45:31.990
See what I mean?
It's the same old shit all the time.

45:32.060 --> 45:35.325
It's... It's red. I have...
It's a red Cavalier.

45:35.397 --> 45:38.093
That's nice.

45:39.834 --> 45:41.927
- How are you guys doing?
- It's on, Mike. It's on.

45:42.003 --> 45:44.267
- Yeah? Which one?
- Uh, Groucho.

45:44.339 --> 45:46.273
With the cigar?

45:47.642 --> 45:49.940
- She's cute, man.
- Jesus Christ.

45:50.011 --> 45:51.945
What's wrong?

45:52.013 --> 45:55.278
- Mike, you just looked right at her.
- Come on, she didn't notice.

45:55.350 --> 45:58.114
- Yeah, she did.
- I better go in early now.

45:58.186 --> 46:01.121
- I'm sorry, man. I didn't know.
- Don't sweat it, Mike.

46:01.189 --> 46:03.384
It's gonna be a lay-up.

46:03.458 --> 46:05.790
36-24-36
What a winnin' hand

46:05.860 --> 46:08.385
- Uh...
- How're you guys doing?

46:08.463 --> 46:10.727
- Not well.
- What, rejected?

46:10.799 --> 46:12.733
"Shaqued."

46:12.801 --> 46:15.565
Just watch old T-bone
there and learn.

46:15.637 --> 46:20.109
She's a brick house

46:20.242 --> 46:24.313
My whole life people have told me
I have this star quality.

46:24.314 --> 46:26.747
- Have they?
- Well, I don't know if it's true.

46:26.815 --> 46:29.409
But, well, this one time...
this is really stupid...

46:29.485 --> 46:31.817
- But in kindergarten, you know...
- It's all right.

46:31.887 --> 46:35.254
You know how you have those little
crushes? I had this crush on this guy Lee.

46:35.324 --> 46:39.055
He was really cute, and he
wore Lee Jeans. They said "Lee."

46:39.128 --> 46:42.063
Anyway, I really liked him.
And then one day he told me I was ugly.

46:42.131 --> 46:45.589
I started crying,
and my teacher was, like,

46:45.667 --> 46:48.761
"Deidre, you are so emotional.
You are so dramatic.

46:48.837 --> 46:51.067
You should be an actress!"

46:51.140 --> 46:54.234
- It was, like, that's it!
I should be an actress.

46:54.309 --> 46:56.937
And you know what?
I can cry on cue.

46:57.012 --> 46:58.946
- Yeah! Well, totally.
- Uh-huh.

46:59.014 --> 47:02.006
Well, that's really been sort of my
thing, you know. It got me into Juilliard.

47:02.084 --> 47:04.348
And the agent said to me
afterwards that he thought...

47:04.419 --> 47:06.353
he really was reminded by me...

47:06.421 --> 47:08.582
of Tina Yothers,
you know, from Family Ties.

47:08.657 --> 47:11.023
And he said
I looked just like her.

47:18.300 --> 47:22.760
She's the one, the only one
Built like an Amazon, Yeah

47:22.838 --> 47:25.238
Was that money or what?

47:25.307 --> 47:27.901
Kind of a dick move,
if you ask me.

47:27.976 --> 47:30.137
Why, baby?
What'd I do wrong?

47:30.212 --> 47:33.079
- You asked a girl for her number and you tore it up.
- She didn't see that.

47:33.148 --> 47:35.639
- It doesn't matter.
- That was pretty cold, dude.

47:35.717 --> 47:38.242
What was so cold about it?

47:40.722 --> 47:42.656
Right.

47:42.724 --> 47:45.818
See, man, you can't roll with that.
She's business class.

47:45.894 --> 47:49.421
- Business class?
- Big butt. You know, can't fly coach?

47:49.498 --> 47:51.432
You guys are terrible.

47:52.834 --> 47:56.600
Gentlemen,
out of Glenfiddich.

47:56.672 --> 47:59.266
- What else is going on?
- Could hit the Dresden.

47:59.341 --> 48:01.275
Perfect.

48:01.343 --> 48:05.370
Well, this place
is dead anyway, man. Let's do it.

49:12.014 --> 49:14.949
What do you say, man?

49:15.017 --> 49:17.349
You can tell by the way
I use my walk

49:17.419 --> 49:19.887
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk

49:19.955 --> 49:21.889
- Hi, friends.
- The music's loud and women warm

49:21.957 --> 49:25.051
I've been kicked around
since I was born

49:25.127 --> 49:28.722
Now it's all right, it's okay
You may look the other way

49:28.797 --> 49:33.200
- You can try to understand
- New York Times' effect on man

49:33.268 --> 49:35.236
Whether you're a brother
or whether you're a mother

49:35.304 --> 49:37.738
We're staying alive
Staying alive

49:37.806 --> 49:40.001
Feel the city shaking
and everybody's breaking

49:40.075 --> 49:42.407
I'm staying alive
Staying alive

49:42.477 --> 49:49.849
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Staying ali-ive

49:49.918 --> 49:53.649
Ahh, ahh

49:59.294 --> 50:02.422
Yeah, I know what you're saying, man.
I just don't know what to tell you.

50:02.497 --> 50:04.761
I mean, does it
have to be Goofy?

50:04.833 --> 50:08.269
You know, I was Hamlet two months
ago Off-Broadway, and I was good.

50:08.337 --> 50:10.567
- Yeah.
- Wow!

50:10.639 --> 50:14.939
- Someone got out of school early today.
- They like our vibe.

50:19.414 --> 50:22.178
- Oh, it's on.
- It's definitely on.

50:22.250 --> 50:24.184
Feel the city shaking
and everybody's breaking

50:24.252 --> 50:26.584
We're staying alive
Staying alive

50:26.655 --> 50:30.955
- Ah, ha, ha, ha, staying alive Staying alive
- God bless you guys.

50:31.026 --> 50:39.058
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Staying ali-ive

50:39.134 --> 50:41.694
Ahh, ahh

50:44.873 --> 50:49.776
Hi, can I get a Dewars on the, uh,
Dewars on the rocks?

50:51.213 --> 50:55.149
- I-I can't even get
this guy to notice me.

50:55.217 --> 50:58.152
You're laughing at me?
That's funny to you, huh?

50:58.220 --> 51:00.984
Great. Good. Great day.

51:01.056 --> 51:03.320
I- I'm sorry. I shouldn't.

51:03.392 --> 51:07.158
- Let me make it up to you.
- Hang on, Nick.

51:07.229 --> 51:10.255
That's pretty...
They know you around here, huh?

51:10.332 --> 51:12.994
Uh, hi. I'll have a Dewars
on the rocks, please.

51:13.068 --> 51:17.835
And some more olives for...
for our little friend here.

51:17.906 --> 51:21.103
Do I know you?
I mean, where do I know you from?

51:21.176 --> 51:25.340
Um, you ever been
to the Ha-Ha Hole on Pico?

51:25.414 --> 51:28.406
- Hmm, no.
- No? You're sure? Monday nights, open mike?

51:28.483 --> 51:31.316
- I host an open mike there.
- Hmm, no.

51:31.386 --> 51:33.786
Oh, you're...
you're a comedian.

51:33.855 --> 51:36.483
Yeah.

51:36.558 --> 51:40.426
Yeah, it's a dream, you know. It's a lot
of hard work and travel and, uh, hotels.

51:40.495 --> 51:43.828
I have a new booking agent, though, so
I'm part of the whole Vegas circuits.

51:43.899 --> 51:48.131
The money's pretty good. I might buy
a car, I think. You know, a foreign car.

51:48.203 --> 51:50.637
Treat myself. I figure
I worked for it. Why not?

51:50.705 --> 51:53.731
I know where it is.
Starbucks.

51:53.809 --> 51:56.801
I served you an espresso
at Starbucks.

51:56.878 --> 52:00.279
Espresso. An espresso. Yes, that's
my drink. That's probably it.

52:00.348 --> 52:02.282
That's great.
Isn't that funny?

52:02.350 --> 52:04.511
You came in and asked me
for an application.

52:04.586 --> 52:07.680
And then I took you and
introduced you to my manager.

52:10.325 --> 52:13.192
Must've been a while ago, 'cause
right now I have a booking agent.

52:13.261 --> 52:16.253
'Cause I've been... I have
a booking agent now that I've got.

52:16.331 --> 52:18.265
- No.
- Yeah.

52:18.333 --> 52:20.927
- It was about two weeks ago.
- It was probably more.

52:21.002 --> 52:23.766
Probably longer, 'cause things
have been going very well lately.

52:23.839 --> 52:25.773
I haven't been looking
for a job in a while.

52:25.841 --> 52:28.605
It could have been someone who looks like me,
'cause there's a lot of people who look kinda...

52:28.677 --> 52:32.340
- See, I have a face that's similar...
- You better pay the man.

52:32.414 --> 52:36.544
Here's the, uh...
Here's... Just take this.

52:36.618 --> 52:39.712
I've been doing very well.
Thank you. Uh, thank you...

52:39.788 --> 52:42.120
- Nikki.
- Nikki. Thank you, Nikki.

52:42.190 --> 52:44.124
Mm-hmm.

52:46.962 --> 52:49.897
- We got digits, baby.
- Yeah, what a surprise.

52:49.965 --> 52:52.456
What's wrong with you? I saw you
talkin' to a beautiful brunette baby.

52:52.534 --> 52:54.968
She didn't like me, okay?
I made a fool of myself.

52:55.036 --> 52:58.472
- Baby, don't talk that way.
- You're so money, and you don't even know it.

52:58.540 --> 53:02.067
- That's what I keep tryin' to tell him.
- Could you not mess with me?

53:02.143 --> 53:05.010
- Baby, we're not messing with you.
- We're not.

53:05.080 --> 53:08.413
You know what you are? You're like
a big bear with claws and fangs, man.

53:08.483 --> 53:11.077
- Big fuckin' teeth, man.
- Yeah, big fuckin' teeth on ya.

53:11.152 --> 53:14.417
She's just like this little bunny who's
just kinda cowering in the corner.

53:14.489 --> 53:17.424
- Shivering.
- Yeah, man, just kinda...

53:17.492 --> 53:20.427
You got these claws and you're staring at
these claws, and you're thinkin' to yourself,

53:20.495 --> 53:23.191
with these claws, you're thinkin', "How
am I supposed to kill this bunny?"

53:23.265 --> 53:25.199
You're pokin' at it, man.

53:25.267 --> 53:27.869
You're not hurtin' it. You're just
kinda gently battin' the bunny around.

53:28.002 --> 53:30.454
You know what I mean?
And the bunny's scared of you.

53:30.455 --> 53:32.906
- And it's shivering.
- You got the fucking claws!

53:32.974 --> 53:36.432
These claws and these fangs! You're
looking at your claws and your fangs.

53:36.510 --> 53:39.104
You're thinking to yourself,
"I don't know what to do, man.

53:39.180 --> 53:42.946
I don't know how to kill the bunny." With
this, you don't know how to kill the bunny!

53:43.017 --> 53:45.611
You're like
a big bear, man.

53:45.686 --> 53:48.450
- So you're not just fuckin' with me?
- No, I'm not fucking with you!

53:48.522 --> 53:50.456
- Honestly!
- Mike, I'm telling you, you're money.

53:50.524 --> 53:52.458
You're so fucking money.

53:52.526 --> 53:54.790
I want you to go over to that girl
and I want you to get those digits.

53:54.862 --> 53:56.796
- You're money.
- Come here a second. Listen to me.

53:56.864 --> 53:59.458
Look it, when you go up
to talk to her, man,

53:59.533 --> 54:04.630
I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13
movie everyone's really hoping makes it happen.

54:04.705 --> 54:07.799
I want you to be like the guy
in the rated R movie, you know?

54:07.875 --> 54:10.241
The guy you're not sure
whether or not you like yet.

54:10.311 --> 54:12.745
You're not sure where he's coming
from, okay? You're a bad man.

54:12.813 --> 54:15.077
You're a bad man.
You're a bad man.

54:15.149 --> 54:17.344
Bad man.

54:55.957 --> 54:58.391
All right, all right.

55:00.027 --> 55:02.587
See, baby,
it's not that hard.

55:02.663 --> 55:04.961
- 818?
- 310.

55:05.032 --> 55:07.125
Nice.

55:07.201 --> 55:09.692
- So how long do I wait to call?
- A day.

55:09.770 --> 55:12.170
- Tomorrow.
- Mm-mmm.

55:12.239 --> 55:14.173
- Tomorrow, then a day.
- Yeah.

55:14.241 --> 55:17.233
- So two days.
- Yeah, I guess you could call it that... two days.

55:17.311 --> 55:19.745
Definitely. Two days
is like industry standard.

55:19.814 --> 55:24.478
I used to wait two days to call anybody, but
now it's like everyone in town waits two days.

55:24.552 --> 55:26.543
So I think three days is kinda money.
What do you think?

55:26.620 --> 55:29.418
- Two's enough not to look anxious.
- Two's enough not to look anxious.

55:29.490 --> 55:31.685
But I think three days
is kinda money.

55:31.759 --> 55:33.693
Maybe I'll wait three weeks.
How's that?

55:33.761 --> 55:36.093
And tell her I was cleaning out my wallet
and I just happened to run into her number.

55:36.163 --> 55:38.097
- Then ask her where you met her.
- Yeah.

55:38.165 --> 55:40.929
I don't remember. What does she look
like? Then I'll ask if we fucked.

55:41.002 --> 55:43.266
Would that...
T, would that be the money?

55:43.337 --> 55:45.430
You know what? Ha, ha, ha, Mike.
Laugh all you want.

55:45.506 --> 55:50.842
But if you call too soon, you might scare
off a nice baby who's ready to party.

55:50.911 --> 55:55.245
- How long are you guys gonna wait to call your babies?
- Six days.

55:55.316 --> 55:59.946
Different, I don't know, schools of
philosophy, they all can fight each other.

56:02.023 --> 56:05.459
- I think I like this town.
- No, no, gotta go to New Orleans.

56:05.526 --> 56:07.460
Hey, how're you doin'?

56:08.729 --> 56:11.095
Watch where you're going, asshole.

56:11.165 --> 56:13.099
What'd you say, bitch?

56:15.636 --> 56:18.434
I said watch where
you're going, bitch.

56:18.506 --> 56:22.272
- Oh, so you want something.
- Hey, fucker. Hey.

56:22.343 --> 56:24.607
- Fuck him up.
- Smack that fuckin' bitch.

56:24.678 --> 56:27.374
- Yeah, motherfucker.
- You got a fucking problem with me, bitch?

56:27.448 --> 56:30.349
Come on! Yeah, I got
a fuckin' problem, motherfucker!

56:30.418 --> 56:33.182
- Yeah, come on!
- You're the fuckin' bitch, baby!

56:33.254 --> 56:36.621
- Come on, bitch. You little fuckin' pussy!
- Come on, punk, do it.

56:36.690 --> 56:38.681
- Slap that bitch.
- Roll up, bitch.

56:38.759 --> 56:42.718
- Hey, you're a fuckin' bitch! You're a fuckin' bitch!
- You wanna go?

56:42.797 --> 56:45.630
I'll show you who
the fucking bitch is!

56:45.699 --> 56:47.894
Huh?

56:47.968 --> 56:51.096
You're the fucking bitch!

56:51.172 --> 56:53.663
Motherfucker!

57:00.214 --> 57:03.650
- What the fuck?
- You asshole! Didn't you see Boyz N the Hood?

57:03.717 --> 57:06.777
- Now one of us is gonna get shot.
- He ain't gonna do anything.

57:06.854 --> 57:09.220
- You fuckin' asshole.
- What a fuckin' dick.

57:09.290 --> 57:12.225
What the fuck did you want me to do,
back down? He called me a bitch.

57:12.293 --> 57:15.888
- We kept our rep, bro.
- Fuck rep, man. I got a callback tomorrow.

57:15.963 --> 57:18.295
Yeah, I gotta get up
early tomorrow.

57:20.468 --> 57:25.167
What the fuck are you carrying a gun for?
In case somebody steps to you, Snoop Dogg?

57:25.239 --> 57:27.298
Hey, man, you're not from here.
You don't know how it is.

57:27.374 --> 57:29.433
- I grew up in L.A.
- Anaheim.

57:29.510 --> 57:33.105
Whatever, man. It's different out here.
It's not like New York, Mikey.

57:33.180 --> 57:36.809
Fuckin' A right, it's not like New York.
Out here you can avoid trouble.

57:36.884 --> 57:40.581
It's not like you live in Compton, Sue,
with bullets whizzing by your head.

57:40.654 --> 57:43.851
You live in a good neighborhood, man.
In New York trouble finds you.

57:43.924 --> 57:47.655
- People get carjacked.
- Oh, man, who would ever carjack your fuckin' K car?

57:47.728 --> 57:49.992
He's right, Sue.
You don't need to carry a gat.

57:50.064 --> 57:52.498
Just 'cause I had the balls
to stand up to these guys...

57:52.566 --> 57:55.000
Like fuckin' House of Pain
was gonna do anything?

57:55.069 --> 57:58.732
- You like in this fucking fantasy world.
- Wha...

57:58.806 --> 58:01.832
What about you, Mikey?
At least I fuckin' have balls, man.

58:01.909 --> 58:05.868
You're always whining about some bitch
that left you a year ago!

58:05.946 --> 58:08.471
It was six months ago,
and she didn't leave me.

58:08.549 --> 58:11.643
Whatever, man! You're like
a fuckin' little whiny bitch, man.

58:11.719 --> 58:14.654
Oh, whoopee, you got a number tonight?
You're gonna fuck it up.

58:14.722 --> 58:19.125
- Hey, Sue.
- No. Have you gotten laid once since you moved out here?

58:19.193 --> 58:22.287
- Have you fucked once?
- Why don't you shut the fuck up for a little bit?

58:22.363 --> 58:24.797
I know for a fact that you haven't.
You know how I know?

58:24.865 --> 58:27.959
- 'Cause you never shut up about it!
- Shut the fuck up, Sue!

58:28.035 --> 58:30.833
- Ah, he's fuckin' right.
- Shut up! Hey, Mike, come here.

58:30.905 --> 58:34.068
Mike, come back here!
Mike, come back here!

58:34.141 --> 58:36.974
- He was fuckin' pissing me off!
- Just shut the fuck up.

58:37.044 --> 58:40.639
Just shut the fuck up. I don't even
want to fuckin' talk to you right now.

58:40.714 --> 58:43.512
- I do...
- Shut the fuck up!

58:59.066 --> 59:01.660
You have no messages.

59:55.923 --> 59:59.552
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

59:59.627 --> 01:00:01.959
Hi. Uh, Nikki, this is Mike.

01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:05.726
I met you at the, um,
at the Dresden, uh, tonight.

01:00:05.799 --> 01:00:09.667
Uh, I just called t-to say
that I had a great time...

01:00:09.737 --> 01:00:13.138
and you should call me tomorrow,
or in, uh, t-two days, uh, whatever.

01:00:13.207 --> 01:00:15.198
Anyway, uh, my number...

01:00:15.276 --> 01:00:20.213

01:00:34.795 --> 01:00:37.730
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

01:00:37.798 --> 01:00:39.732
Hi, uh, Nikki,
this is Mike again.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.735
I just called 'cause it sounded like
your machine might've cut me off...

01:00:42.803 --> 01:00:45.738
when, uh, when I... before I finished
leaving my number.

01:00:45.806 --> 01:00:49.071
Anyway, uh... And also, uh,
sorry to call so late,

01:00:49.143 --> 01:00:53.079
but you were still at the Dresden when
I left, so I knew I'd get your machine.

01:00:53.147 --> 01:00:55.615
Anyhow, uh, uh,
my number's 2-1...

01:01:03.624 --> 01:01:06.354
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

01:01:06.427 --> 01:01:10.363
213-555-4679. That's it.
Just wanna leave my number.

01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:13.889
I didn't want you to think
I was weird or desperate or...

01:01:15.035 --> 01:01:16.969
We should just,
uh, hang out...

01:01:17.037 --> 01:01:18.971
and, uh, see where it goes.

01:01:19.039 --> 01:01:21.974
'Cause it's nice and, uh,
you know, no expectations.

01:01:22.042 --> 01:01:24.977
So, okay?
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.

01:01:39.693 --> 01:01:42.127
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

01:01:42.196 --> 01:01:44.630
I just got out of a six-year
relationship, okay?

01:01:44.698 --> 01:01:48.634
That should help explain why I'm acting
so weird. I just wanted you to know that.

01:01:48.702 --> 01:01:51.637
It's not you, it's me.
I'm sorry.

01:01:54.008 --> 01:01:55.737
This is Mike.

01:02:04.752 --> 01:02:07.186
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

01:02:07.254 --> 01:02:10.189
Hi, Nikki, this is Mike. Could you just,
uh, call me when you get in?

01:02:10.257 --> 01:02:13.192
I'm gonna be up for a while and
I'd rather speak to you in person...

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.524
instead of trying to fit it all into...

01:02:15.596 --> 01:02:17.757
Fuck!

01:02:25.372 --> 01:02:28.535
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:32.103
Uh, Nikki? M-Mike.

01:02:33.614 --> 01:02:35.673
It's, uh, uh...
It's just, uh...

01:02:35.749 --> 01:02:37.683
This just isn't working out.

01:02:37.751 --> 01:02:41.118
I- I think you're great,
but, uh, I-I...

01:02:41.188 --> 01:02:44.316
Maybe we should just take
some time off from each other.

01:02:44.391 --> 01:02:48.327
It's not you, it's me.
It's what I'm going through.

01:02:48.395 --> 01:02:50.829
All right? Uh, i-i-it's, it...

01:02:50.898 --> 01:02:53.833
It's only been six months...

01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:56.563
- Mike?
- Nikki! Great!

01:02:56.637 --> 01:03:00.471
D- Did you just walk in,
or were you listening all along?

01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:03.203
Don't ever call me again.

01:03:03.277 --> 01:03:06.212
Wow. I-I guess you're home.

01:03:27.668 --> 01:03:30.296
Hey, this is Mike.
Leave a message after the beep.

01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:37.106
Hey, Mikey, it's Trent.
You home? You there?

01:03:37.177 --> 01:03:39.611
All right, man,
I guess you're not home.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.706
Why don't you come out tonight, Mikey?
I haven't seen you for two days.

01:03:42.783 --> 01:03:45.308
We're gonna play hockey
at Sue's house until 10:30,

01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:48.321
and then we're either going to
the Lava Lounge for Sinatra Night...

01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:51.324
or we'll be at the Derby
for Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:54.327
We might also check out
Swing Night at the El Rey.

01:03:54.395 --> 01:03:57.330
And if we're not there we'll be
at the Three of Clubs, all right?

01:03:57.398 --> 01:04:01.391
Otherwise we'll be at the Dresden Room,
so come on out and meet up with us.

01:04:01.468 --> 01:04:03.993
See you soon, gorgeous.

01:04:57.191 --> 01:05:00.627
Hey, this is Mike. Leave a message
after the beep.

01:05:00.694 --> 01:05:02.628
Mikey, it's Rob.
I'm downstairs.

01:05:02.696 --> 01:05:05.722
Come on, pick it up
and buzz me in, buddy.

01:05:05.799 --> 01:05:07.733
Come on, open up.

01:05:34.928 --> 01:05:36.862
Thanks, man.

01:05:41.668 --> 01:05:43.602
You eat anything today?

01:05:50.477 --> 01:05:52.411
Yesterday?

01:05:52.479 --> 01:05:54.640
You haven't been drinking,
have you?

01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:14.226
- Sorry about what happened at the Dresden, man.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.

01:06:14.301 --> 01:06:17.236
It's like, now I have my L.A. gun story.

01:06:17.304 --> 01:06:21.832
You should hear the way I tell it
to the guys back home... it's an Uzi.

01:06:27.147 --> 01:06:30.674
- You wanna talk about it?
- What's the point?

01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:40.226
Hey, it's been two days.
You should call that Nikki girl.

01:06:43.931 --> 01:06:45.626
Not your type.

01:06:49.136 --> 01:06:52.071
I'm thinking of
moving back East.

01:06:54.141 --> 01:06:57.076
- Well, that's dumb.
- What's so dumb about it?

01:06:57.144 --> 01:07:00.079
You're doing really well
out here, Mike.

01:07:00.147 --> 01:07:02.081
How well am I doin'?

01:07:02.149 --> 01:07:05.585
I host an open mike;
I play a fuckin' bus driver in a movie.

01:07:05.652 --> 01:07:07.586
Big fuckin' deal.

01:07:07.654 --> 01:07:10.088
I got an agent
that specializes in magicians.

01:07:10.157 --> 01:07:12.091
How good am I doin'?

01:07:12.159 --> 01:07:14.855
Did you get turned down
for Goofy?

01:07:14.928 --> 01:07:16.862
They turned you down?

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:21.367
Yeah, they went with somebody who had
some more theme park experience.

01:07:21.435 --> 01:07:23.596
I killed for that job.

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:27.936
The point is, Mike, it all depends
on how you look at it. All right?

01:07:28.008 --> 01:07:32.240
You're telling me that your life sucks.
That means mine is god-awful.

01:07:32.312 --> 01:07:35.839
Part of the reason I moved out here
is I saw how well you were doing,

01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:38.851
and I figured if you could
make it, I could too.

01:07:38.919 --> 01:07:42.855
- I didn't make it.
- You got an agent. You got in the unions.

01:07:42.923 --> 01:07:45.721
You know, that's your problem,
is that you...

01:07:46.894 --> 01:07:49.829
You don't look at
the things that you have.

01:07:49.897 --> 01:07:52.832
You only look at the stuff
you don't have.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.391
Those guys are right about you.
You're money.

01:07:56.537 --> 01:07:59.301
Then why won't she call?

01:08:01.642 --> 01:08:03.667
She won't call
because you left.

01:08:05.245 --> 01:08:08.544
She's got her own life to deal with,
man, and that's in New York.

01:08:08.615 --> 01:08:11.550
She's a sweet girl
and I love her to pieces,

01:08:11.618 --> 01:08:14.553
but fuck her, man...
you gotta get on with your life.

01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:19.888
You gotta let go of the past, and Mikey,
when you do the future is beautiful.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.154
All right?
Look out the window.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:26.221
It's sunny every day here.
It's like manifest destiny.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:31.237
Don't tell me we didn't make it.
We made it. We are here.

01:08:31.305 --> 01:08:34.240
Everything that is past
is prologue to this.

01:08:34.308 --> 01:08:37.277
All of the shit that
didn't kill us is only...

01:08:37.344 --> 01:08:39.538
Ah, you know.
All that shit.

01:08:40.814 --> 01:08:42.907
You're gonna get over it.

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:49.555
How did you get over it?
How long did it take?

01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:54.082
I don't know.
Sometimes it still hurts.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.424
You know how it is, man.
It's like...

01:08:56.496 --> 01:08:59.430
You wake up every day,
it hurts a little bit less,

01:08:59.499 --> 01:09:02.627
then you wake up one day
and it doesn't hurt at all.

01:09:02.702 --> 01:09:04.602
And the funny thing is...

01:09:04.671 --> 01:09:07.606
This is kinda weird,
but it's like...

01:09:08.675 --> 01:09:10.609
you almost miss that pain.

01:09:16.549 --> 01:09:18.642
You miss the pain?

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:23.384
Yeah, for the same reason
that you miss her.

01:09:23.456 --> 01:09:26.390
Because you... you lived
with it for so long.

01:09:32.231 --> 01:09:34.596
Let's go get
something to eat.

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:36.828
All right. Sure.

01:09:36.903 --> 01:09:38.837
You look like shit.

01:09:44.577 --> 01:09:46.943
Mikey! What's up, man?

01:09:47.013 --> 01:09:48.947
You wanna play again, motherfucker?

01:09:49.015 --> 01:09:51.448
I'm glad you came out tonight.
It's good to see you.

01:09:51.517 --> 01:09:53.849
- You're my problem, you bitch motherfucker!
- Come on in.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.854
- Come on, bitch!
- You want some?

01:09:55.922 --> 01:09:58.083
- Hey, guys! Mikey's here!
- What's up, Mikey?

01:09:58.157 --> 01:10:01.092
What's up, baby?

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.493
- Oh, so you want some? You want some?
- You ain't shit!

01:10:04.564 --> 01:10:07.965
Roll up, bitch! Roll up!
Roll. That's right.

01:10:08.034 --> 01:10:10.502
You run. You run, baby.

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:13.130
Blast him!
Come on, hit him!

01:10:13.206 --> 01:10:15.140
- All right.
- Okay, bitch.

01:10:15.208 --> 01:10:17.176
- You ready, hip hop?
- Uh-huh.

01:10:17.243 --> 01:10:19.837
- Come on, man! Let's move it up!
- Hey, man.

01:10:19.912 --> 01:10:22.039
What are they doing here?

01:10:22.115 --> 01:10:24.049
Oh, no, no,
it's totally cool, man.

01:10:24.117 --> 01:10:26.745
We saw 'em that night at Roscoe's.
Trent cleared it up.

01:10:26.819 --> 01:10:29.788
I apologized, bought 'em some
chicken and waffles. It's totally fine.

01:10:29.856 --> 01:10:33.292
They fuckin' love T, man.
That boy can talk.

01:10:36.696 --> 01:10:38.391
More important, man,

01:10:38.464 --> 01:10:40.398
I'm sorry about what I said.

01:10:40.466 --> 01:10:43.924
I was out of line. I was drunk,
my adrenalin was goin'.

01:10:44.003 --> 01:10:46.870
Yeah, you know, whatever.
I needed a good kick in the ass.

01:10:46.939 --> 01:10:51.239
It was a... I don't know. We're better
friends for it. All right?

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:53.904
All right, man.

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:56.073
- Roll up, bitch! Roll!
- Come on, let's see it!

01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:58.242
- Thanks, man.
- Get off me!

01:10:58.317 --> 01:11:01.309
I been hatin' myself
for the last few days.

01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:05.414
- That's all right. I keep it in the zone.
- Look, I know what that's like.

01:11:05.491 --> 01:11:08.426
- Come on, Superman.
- You watchin', New Kids On The Block?

01:11:08.494 --> 01:11:11.429
- Yo, Double Down, what time we leaving?
- Five minutes, baby.

01:11:11.497 --> 01:11:14.933
Hey, Mikey, you should call that
girl Nikki. It's been two days.

01:11:15.001 --> 01:11:17.936
See if she wants to
meet you there.

01:11:34.187 --> 01:11:36.121
Hey, Curt.

01:11:38.691 --> 01:11:42.127
Aw, we got a line.
We got a line.

01:11:42.195 --> 01:11:44.129
Hey, what's up, Lisa?

01:11:45.932 --> 01:11:48.867
- Let's just take the front.
- We don't gotta wait in line.

01:11:48.935 --> 01:11:51.369
Come on, Mike.

01:11:56.109 --> 01:11:58.043
Hey, hey, Tony.
Whadda ya say, man?

01:11:58.111 --> 01:12:00.045
- How you doin' tonight?
- Hey, Gary.

01:12:00.113 --> 01:12:03.048
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, Tony, man, how'd the audition go?

01:12:03.116 --> 01:12:06.051
- Not happening, man.
- Yeah? You look like you been workin' out though.

01:12:06.119 --> 01:12:08.053
- All right.
- How you doin', man?

01:12:08.121 --> 01:12:10.055
Watch the steps.
They're greasy.

01:12:25.872 --> 01:12:29.364
And it's you and me and the
bottle makes three tonight

01:12:35.181 --> 01:12:37.615
Hey, whadda ya say, man?

01:12:37.683 --> 01:12:40.345
Hey, how's it goin'?
What's up?

01:12:40.419 --> 01:12:42.478
- Hey.
- ¿Que paso?

01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:47.425
How you doin', Annie?
Good to see you. I'll see you soon.

01:12:47.493 --> 01:12:49.427
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hola. ¿Como esta?

01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:51.929
- Raoul, what's up, man?
How's it goin'?

01:12:51.998 --> 01:12:53.932
Keep the waters comin'.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.798
My favorite watering hole

01:12:56.869 --> 01:12:59.394
I said, hey, Moe
How you doin'

01:12:59.472 --> 01:13:01.303
Where have you been

01:13:01.374 --> 01:13:05.868
He said, I been found
buyin' whiskey wine and gin

01:13:05.945 --> 01:13:08.140
Man, I know we gotta go

01:13:08.214 --> 01:13:10.409
It's the same thing
every night

01:13:10.483 --> 01:13:14.579
But I don't think another drink
is gonna make me lose my mind

01:13:14.654 --> 01:13:17.282
So I'll think about
my next drink

01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:21.787
And it's you and me and the bottle
makes three tonight

01:13:21.861 --> 01:13:23.556
Come on, Daddy,
let's get us a drink.

01:13:40.613 --> 01:13:42.774
Swing it, kid!

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.315
Yo! Bartender!

01:13:50.389 --> 01:13:54.416
And Jack, oh, I know
what you're thinkin'

01:13:54.493 --> 01:13:59.123
That now's as good as any
to start drinkin'

01:13:59.198 --> 01:14:01.826
- Hey, Scotty. - Yeah?
- What's it gonna be

01:14:03.369 --> 01:14:06.998
A gin and tonic sounds
mighty, mighty good to me

01:14:08.174 --> 01:14:10.233
Well, man, I know
we gotta go

01:14:10.309 --> 01:14:13.142
It's the same thing
every night

01:14:13.212 --> 01:14:16.739
But I don't think another drink
is gonna make me lose my mind

01:14:16.816 --> 01:14:19.979
So I'll think about
my next drink

01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:24.119
And it's you and me and the bottle
makes three tonight

01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:33.662
And it's you and me and the bottle
makes three tonight

01:14:33.733 --> 01:14:35.428
Okay!

01:14:35.501 --> 01:14:37.435
- To ladies?
- To ladies.

01:14:38.738 --> 01:14:40.672
Gin time.

01:14:41.741 --> 01:14:43.675
I don't know.
I called you Monday.

01:14:43.743 --> 01:14:47.975
You called me? Well, who
did you talk to? I was home Monday.

01:14:48.047 --> 01:14:51.414
It surprises me that you've never mentioned
her before, all the times we've hung out.

01:14:51.484 --> 01:14:53.918
- You never even mentioned me?
- Very pretty girl.

01:14:53.986 --> 01:14:57.319
- I totally mentioned her... I totally mentioned you.
- I'm sorry. Maybe I don't know.

01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:00.325
- Hi, Mike. How are you?
- You know what's funny?

01:15:00.393 --> 01:15:04.056
- When we... When we played football that day,
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:07.327
I don't remember you ever leaving long
enough to make a phone call to anybody.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.834
This is what happened.
She's a nice girl.

01:16:13.632 --> 01:16:15.566
Excuse me.

01:16:32.484 --> 01:16:34.418
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:38.284
- I'm, uh, I'm Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

01:16:38.357 --> 01:16:40.848
- I'm Lorraine.
- Like the quiche.

01:16:40.926 --> 01:16:44.225
Yeah, yeah, the quiche.
That's a really original joke.

01:16:45.631 --> 01:16:47.565
I like quiche. How's that?

01:16:47.633 --> 01:16:51.069
Yeah? Well, I thought real men
didn't like quiche.

01:16:51.136 --> 01:16:54.936
Yeah, well, uh, my reputation seems
to have preceded me here.

01:16:55.007 --> 01:16:56.941
You're not a real man?

01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:59.944
Not lately, no.

01:17:01.013 --> 01:17:02.947
Not funny, okay?

01:17:03.015 --> 01:17:05.677
- You're fuckin' hurting feelings here.
- Hey, it's on. It's on.

01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:08.948
- Oh. It's on.
- It is so on.

01:17:13.926 --> 01:17:17.953
I figured, they make movies in L.A.,
not in Wisconsin, so I moved here.

01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:19.964
Just like that.

01:17:20.032 --> 01:17:23.559
- Well, yeah. It wasn't that simple, but...
- How was it hard?

01:17:25.638 --> 01:17:27.629
I left someone
really special behind.

01:17:27.706 --> 01:17:29.640
Tell me about it.

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:32.438
- You too?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:17:32.511 --> 01:17:34.445
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

01:17:34.513 --> 01:17:37.175
- Oh. I thought I was gonna die.
- Oh, God.

01:17:37.249 --> 01:17:41.049
It's been six months and I'm just
starting to get over it now.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.486
Wow, that's two more
than me.

01:17:43.555 --> 01:17:47.514
- Tell me it gets better.
- Oh, it does, yeah. It does.

01:17:47.593 --> 01:17:49.652
God bless him.

01:17:51.597 --> 01:17:53.690
God bless that kid.

01:17:53.766 --> 01:17:55.996
That's great, man.

01:17:56.068 --> 01:17:58.002
What advantages, you mean?

01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:01.471
Yeah. You said there are
advantages to being single.

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:04.168
I just wanna know
what the advantages are.

01:18:04.243 --> 01:18:07.644
Well, exactly, it's like,
you know, you, uh, have com...

01:18:07.713 --> 01:18:12.741
If you meet a girl in a bar and talk to her, you
don't have to worry if anybody's watching you.

01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:14.718
What else?

01:18:14.787 --> 01:18:17.221
What? You can do
whatever you want, you know.

01:18:17.289 --> 01:18:20.383
You grow, go out, anything.

01:18:20.459 --> 01:18:23.690
Like, if I met a handsome
young man at a bar,

01:18:23.762 --> 01:18:26.060
I could just ask him to dance?

01:18:26.131 --> 01:18:29.225
If the guy wanted to, yeah.

01:18:29.301 --> 01:18:31.269
You don't think
he would want to?

01:18:31.337 --> 01:18:36.274
Oh, yeah... No, I mean, he would
want to with you. Sure. I mean, if he...

01:18:36.342 --> 01:18:39.869
Sure. M-M-Maybe it's just that
he doesn't feel like dancing.

01:18:40.979 --> 01:18:42.913
Would you dance with me?

01:18:43.982 --> 01:18:45.916
Okay.

01:18:49.788 --> 01:18:52.723
Dude, check it out, dude.
I swear to God, it's fuckin' on.

01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:55.225
- Dude, it's so fuckin' on, dude.
- I know. It's on.

01:18:55.294 --> 01:18:57.228
- Give it up for Mike.
- Look, I...

01:18:57.296 --> 01:19:00.231
- Dude, it's fucking on, dude!
- Okay, okay. It's on, dude.

01:19:00.299 --> 01:19:03.029
- It's on. To you.
- Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:46.106
Thanks.

01:19:51.016 --> 01:19:52.347
Go, daddy-o

01:19:55.654 --> 01:19:56.643
Go, daddy-o

01:20:00.159 --> 01:20:02.150
Go, daddy-o

01:20:40.999 --> 01:20:42.933
Go!

01:21:13.532 --> 01:21:14.521
Go, daddy-o

01:21:18.036 --> 01:21:19.970
Go, daddy-o

01:21:22.741 --> 01:21:24.106
Go, daddy-o

01:22:20.665 --> 01:22:22.599
All right.

01:22:29.173 --> 01:22:31.107
This is it.

01:22:33.511 --> 01:22:35.445
Yeah.

01:22:35.513 --> 01:22:38.448
- I had a... I had a great time tonight.
- Me too.

01:22:40.184 --> 01:22:42.277
We should do it again
some time.

01:22:42.353 --> 01:22:44.218
I'll be around.

01:22:44.289 --> 01:22:46.223
That's not gonna be
good enough.

01:22:46.291 --> 01:22:49.226
I wanna make plans
to see you again.

01:22:51.462 --> 01:22:53.396
I got a pen in my car.

01:22:53.464 --> 01:22:56.399
- Uh, I mean, yeah.
Do you have something to write on?

01:22:56.467 --> 01:22:58.958
Yeah. Yeah.

01:23:04.609 --> 01:23:07.442
Ahh. Oh, you're a comedian.

01:23:07.512 --> 01:23:09.946
- Yeah, and an actor. Kind of.
- Oh.

01:23:10.014 --> 01:23:11.948
Can I come see you
some time?

01:23:12.016 --> 01:23:14.951
If and when I get a real gig,
I'll give you a call.

01:23:15.019 --> 01:23:17.954
- How's that?
- It's not going too well?

01:23:18.022 --> 01:23:21.287
No, when I, uh, I lived in
New York they made it sound...

01:23:21.359 --> 01:23:26.126
like, uh, they were giving sitcoms
out to stand-ups at the airport here.

01:23:26.197 --> 01:23:29.132
I been here six months,
all I got to show for it is black lung.

01:23:35.807 --> 01:23:39.243
Didn't you tell me that
I should be patient with my career?

01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:43.246
Yeah, but entertainment law
isn't something you just jump into.

01:23:43.314 --> 01:23:46.340
Well, neither is acting,
not if you're serious about it.

01:23:48.019 --> 01:23:50.954
- Yeah.
- Can I have one of these cards?

01:23:51.022 --> 01:23:53.718
- Why? You like the duck with the cigar?
- Yeah.

01:23:53.791 --> 01:23:56.521
Yeah, it's the logo
from You Bet Your Life.

01:23:56.594 --> 01:23:59.529
- Nice touch.
- I can't believe you got that.

01:23:59.597 --> 01:24:02.532
You know, not one
club owner got that.

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.036
- They all asked me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
- They're idiots.

01:24:06.104 --> 01:24:08.038
At least it's not Goofy.

01:24:10.341 --> 01:24:14.004
Well, I guess I should be getting home.
It's really getting late.

01:24:14.078 --> 01:24:17.275
Yeah, sure. It's gettin'
kinda late, so you probably...

01:24:17.348 --> 01:24:21.284
Do you want me to drive you
to your car?

01:24:21.352 --> 01:24:23.479
- That's my hog right th...
- Oh.

01:24:23.554 --> 01:24:25.988
No, I'm across the street. Yeah.

01:24:26.057 --> 01:24:28.992
- Yeah? Which one?
- The red piece of shit over there.

01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.722
- Yeah? Well, it suits you.
- Get the hell outta here.

01:24:31.796 --> 01:24:33.730
Okay.

01:25:03.628 --> 01:25:06.392
Party, buddy! Yeah! Dig that!

01:25:09.233 --> 01:25:12.100
- Will you shut up?
- You were great tonight!

01:25:12.170 --> 01:25:15.435
There she is!

01:25:15.506 --> 01:25:20.500
The wonderful lady. Right? Personality
plus, every time I come in here.

01:25:20.578 --> 01:25:23.775
Nothin' but smiles for me.
Whatever. Here it is.

01:25:23.848 --> 01:25:26.476
Dinner at the Apollo.
Me and you.

01:25:26.551 --> 01:25:28.815
- See that? He's being funny.
- Whatever.

01:25:28.886 --> 01:25:32.014
I don't have to be liked by everyone. Some
don't like me. I don't like certain people.

01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:35.526
- Darlin', I think everything looks absolutely wonderful.
- Thank you.

01:25:35.593 --> 01:25:38.323
- Oww! What the hell are you kickin' me for?
- Shh!

01:25:38.396 --> 01:25:43.095
Fine, I'll ask her. Ma'am! Where do the
high school girls hang out around here?

01:25:43.167 --> 01:25:45.761
You were fuckin'
off your ass tonight.

01:25:45.837 --> 01:25:47.862
- Shh.
- Where'd you learn your stuff, man?

01:25:47.939 --> 01:25:50.965
- The twirly-whirly...
- Shh, just be... Shh. Jackknife, shut up.

01:25:51.042 --> 01:25:53.476
I took a ballroom class
with Michelle.

01:25:53.544 --> 01:25:56.980
She's the only one I danced with
'til tonight. That Lorraine is good.

01:25:57.048 --> 01:25:59.983
You are definitely good. Did you even
see how she was vibing you tonight?

01:26:00.051 --> 01:26:03.748
- Sorry, man.
- You coulda hit that if you didn't have to take us home.

01:26:03.821 --> 01:26:05.755
- Definitely.
- It's not like that.

01:26:05.823 --> 01:26:08.758
- Don't give me that shit. I think she likes you.
- I know she does.

01:26:08.826 --> 01:26:11.260
- I really do!
- Shh! Shut up, okay? I know she likes me.

01:26:11.329 --> 01:26:14.264
- I just didn't wanna do anything tonight.
- You know what, Mike?

01:26:14.332 --> 01:26:16.266
- Wait three days before you call her.
- You don't have to wait.

01:26:16.334 --> 01:26:18.268
- He should wait two days.
- If he's smart about it...

01:26:18.336 --> 01:26:21.271
Shh! You know what?
I have it under control. Okay?

01:26:21.339 --> 01:26:23.273
He has it under control.

01:26:23.341 --> 01:26:25.775
Well, I guess we don't have to
worry about him anymore.

01:26:25.843 --> 01:26:27.777
Our little baby's
all "growns" up.

01:26:27.845 --> 01:26:30.177
- You know what?
- Shh! Shut up. Come on.

01:26:30.248 --> 01:26:33.183
- Our little baby's all "growns" up.
- Why do you have to...

01:26:33.251 --> 01:26:36.186
- I'm not even hungry.
I couldn't touch it.

01:26:36.254 --> 01:26:41.191
Why do you have to make a major production
every time we go out and embarrass me?

01:26:41.259 --> 01:26:44.126
You know what... Oh, Jesus Christ.
That's all I need.

01:26:44.195 --> 01:26:47.494
Our little boy's
all "growns" up tonight!

01:26:47.565 --> 01:26:51.001
You know what, big boy?
You're grown up! You're grown up!

01:26:51.068 --> 01:26:53.263
Yeah! Dig that!

01:26:53.337 --> 01:26:55.271
Is this a fuckin'
production for ya?

01:26:55.339 --> 01:26:58.672
'Cause you're "growns" up and you're
"growns" up and you're "growns" up.

01:26:58.743 --> 01:27:02.406
- Jesus.
- I'm the asshole in the place. Right? I'm the asshole?

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.414
- Oh, God.
- I'm outta here, honey.

01:27:04.482 --> 01:27:07.849
- I wouldn't eat here...
I would never eat here anyway.

01:27:23.501 --> 01:27:25.469
I like cake

01:27:25.536 --> 01:27:27.697
And no mistake

01:27:27.772 --> 01:27:31.435
But baby, if you insist

01:27:31.509 --> 01:27:33.977
I'll cut out cake

01:27:34.045 --> 01:27:35.774
Just for your sake

01:27:35.847 --> 01:27:39.977
Baby, come on
and knock me a kiss

01:27:53.364 --> 01:27:55.298
Knock me a kiss

01:28:55.159 --> 01:28:57.252
- Hello?
- Hi, Michael.

01:28:58.629 --> 01:29:03.123
- Michelle?
- Hi. How's it goin'? It's been a while.

01:29:05.703 --> 01:29:08.433
- S-Six months.
- How are you doin'?

01:29:09.674 --> 01:29:12.666
Uh, fine, I guess.

01:29:12.743 --> 01:29:14.768
- H-How are you?
- Good.

01:29:17.548 --> 01:29:19.914
I, um, I think about things.

01:29:20.985 --> 01:29:23.613
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:27.123
What kind of things?

01:29:27.191 --> 01:29:30.456
You know, us.

01:29:30.528 --> 01:29:33.292
- I thought you met someone else.
- It doesn't matter.

01:29:33.364 --> 01:29:37.425
- I think about you every day.
- Really?

01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:40.902
I miss you, Mike.

01:29:40.972 --> 01:29:43.133
Why didn't you call?

01:29:43.207 --> 01:29:46.574
I don't know.
I mean, I couldn't.

01:29:46.644 --> 01:29:49.078
Do you know how hard it is
to not call you?

01:29:49.146 --> 01:29:52.582
I mean, I pick up the phone every night,
whenever that commercial comes on.

01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:56.484
- The Michelin commercial?
- Yeah, you know, the one with the baby in the tire.

01:29:56.554 --> 01:29:59.751
- One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre.
- Pierre?

01:29:59.824 --> 01:30:02.088
Th-That's his name, Pierre?
What, is he French?

01:30:02.159 --> 01:30:06.255
No, he's not. Listen, it's a whole other
headache and I don't want to talk about him.

01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:08.615
I, um, I called 'cause I heard you
might be moving back to Queens.

01:30:08.616 --> 01:30:10.900
I, um, I called 'cause I heard you
might be moving back to Queens.

01:30:10.968 --> 01:30:16.031
- Yeah. Hang on a second.
Let me get rid of this.

01:30:16.107 --> 01:30:18.200
- Hello?
- Hi, Mike?

01:30:18.275 --> 01:30:20.607
- Lorraine!
- Are you on the other line?

01:30:20.678 --> 01:30:22.942
- Yeah. Oh, hang on a second...
- I could call back.

01:30:23.014 --> 01:30:26.040
No, no. You hang on, okay?
I want to talk to you.

01:30:26.117 --> 01:30:28.108
Just hold on. Hello?

01:30:28.185 --> 01:30:31.279
So I heard you might be
moving back to New York.

01:30:31.355 --> 01:30:35.485
Yeah, I don't think that's going to be happening
just yet. Um, can I call you right back?

01:30:35.559 --> 01:30:39.962
Um, well, I'm going out of town
for a week and the cab's on its way.

01:30:40.031 --> 01:30:42.261
Can't you just talk to me
for five minutes?

01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:44.733
Look, there's somebody holding on the
other line. I have to take this call.

01:30:44.802 --> 01:30:48.067
I really want to catch up with you,
but, um, I have to take the call.

01:30:48.139 --> 01:30:50.903
So just... Uh, I'm gonna call you back
when you get back into town.

01:30:50.975 --> 01:30:52.909
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:30:52.977 --> 01:30:54.911
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

01:30:54.979 --> 01:30:57.072
- Really? You sure?
- It's all right. All right.

01:30:57.148 --> 01:30:59.275
- All right, bye-bye.
- Good-bye. I love y...

01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:02.581
- Hello?
- Hi. Oh, you didn't have to get off of the other line.

01:31:02.653 --> 01:31:05.816
- I would've called you back.
- No, that's okay. I wanted to talk to you.

01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:08.324
You know, I really could...
could've called you back, but...

01:31:08.392 --> 01:31:11.759
Anyway, I probably should have waited
two days. That's what my friends said.

01:31:11.829 --> 01:31:14.593
But... God, I sound like such a schoolgirl.
It's just, they have this thing, okay?

01:31:14.665 --> 01:31:16.599
It's at The Room.
It's Sinatra's birthday.

01:31:16.667 --> 01:31:20.159
And it's one of these Hollywood clubs
and there's no sign.

01:31:20.237 --> 01:31:23.104
Uh, I don't understand why...
why they don't have any signs.

01:31:23.174 --> 01:31:25.608
It's just
I'm really bad at this.

01:31:25.676 --> 01:31:30.113
I just want to know
if you might want to go with me.

01:31:32.349 --> 01:31:35.614
- So, uh, you hung up on which one?
- Michelle.

01:31:35.686 --> 01:31:38.177
- You hung up with your girlfriend.
- Ex.

01:31:38.255 --> 01:31:40.553
- Oh, now she's your ex.
- She was always my ex.

01:31:40.624 --> 01:31:42.558
Yeah, right.

01:31:44.395 --> 01:31:48.991
- You hung up with her?
- I wanted to take the other call.

01:31:49.066 --> 01:31:51.534
- What'd she say when you called her back?
- I didn't.

01:31:54.305 --> 01:31:57.968
- You didn't call her back?
- No.

01:31:58.042 --> 01:32:02.206
- Why not, Mike?
- It didn't occur to me.

01:32:04.048 --> 01:32:05.982
Didn't occur to you.

01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:08.678
It didn't.

01:32:08.752 --> 01:32:13.519
You been, uh, tearing yourself
up about this girl for six months.

01:32:14.592 --> 01:32:16.526
Didn't occur to you?

01:32:18.295 --> 01:32:20.695
No.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.833
Well, Michael, I'll bite.

01:32:28.439 --> 01:32:33.206
You know, man, I didn't understand
it either. It's all so hard.

01:32:33.277 --> 01:32:36.610
Then it hit me on the way over here,
you know, like a ton of bricks.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.614
It's just so simple.

01:32:38.682 --> 01:32:41.276
- When you...
- Dude, dude, wait a second.

01:32:45.456 --> 01:32:48.448
I'm getting vibe like
in a really weird way here.

01:32:50.294 --> 01:32:53.422
This girl's looking at me
like she knows me a little bit.

01:32:53.497 --> 01:32:55.522
- You don't recognize her?
- Mike, I don't know.

01:32:55.599 --> 01:32:58.625
I could've been out with Sue one night
drinking and told her I was a race car driver.

01:32:58.702 --> 01:33:02.331
No, I think I would
remember this girl.

01:33:02.406 --> 01:33:06.809
I don't think I've ever met her before.
I would definitely remember this one.

01:33:06.877 --> 01:33:10.711
She got a lot of confidence, man.
She's doing like...

01:33:10.781 --> 01:33:14.239
- Wow.
- What's going...

01:33:14.318 --> 01:33:16.616
Mike, stop, stop.
Stop, all right? Just stop.

01:33:16.687 --> 01:33:19.087
She's playing a little game,
like a fun thing with me.

01:33:19.156 --> 01:33:22.922
Come on, you little party girl.
That's it. Come on. Fun little games?

01:33:22.993 --> 01:33:26.656
You want to play fun little games? Come
on, you nasty little, cute little baby.

01:33:26.730 --> 01:33:30.598
- What are you doing?
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike. Stop. Don't. Don't, don't.

01:33:30.668 --> 01:33:33.432
She's smiling at me.
She's playing fun little baby games.

01:33:33.504 --> 01:33:36.598
She don't know me. She doesn't
know my address. You know my address?

01:33:36.674 --> 01:33:39.609
You little...
Oh, you... Hold on.

01:33:39.677 --> 01:33:42.612
She's coming over, dude.
Play it cool. She's coming over.

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:46.309
She's like the wild loony. But I threw,
like, the great vibe at her, the funny vibe.

01:33:46.383 --> 01:33:48.510
You'll see.

01:33:48.586 --> 01:33:51.612
- Shit.
- Mommy's big boy.

01:33:51.689 --> 01:33:54.556
We're going bye-bye now.
Yes, we're going bye-bye.

01:33:54.625 --> 01:33:58.288
We're gonna go home,
gonna play with Daddy.

01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:10.236
So, um, so you
called her up, right?

01:34:10.307 --> 01:34:13.242
Or you didn't call her. Why didn't you
call her? You said you didn't call her.

01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:15.696
Why didn't you call her? Mike?

01:34:15.829 --> 01:34:17.463
Mike?

01:34:17.464 --> 01:34:20.490
I never cared much
for moonlit skies

01:34:20.567 --> 01:34:23.934
Never winked back
at fireflies

01:34:24.003 --> 01:34:27.200
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

01:34:27.273 --> 01:34:30.572
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:34:30.643 --> 01:34:34.807
And I never went in
for afterglow

01:34:34.881 --> 01:34:38.248
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

01:34:38.318 --> 01:34:41.378
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

01:34:41.454 --> 01:34:45.220
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:34:45.291 --> 01:34:49.284
I used to ramble
through the park

01:34:49.362 --> 01:34:52.798
Shadowboxin' in the dark

01:34:52.866 --> 01:34:55.733
Then you came
and caused the spark

01:34:55.802 --> 01:34:59.829
That's a four-alarm fire now

01:34:59.906 --> 01:35:02.807
I never made love
by lantern shine

01:35:02.876 --> 01:35:06.573
I never saw rainbows
in my wine

01:35:06.646 --> 01:35:09.979
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

01:35:10.049 --> 01:35:13.541
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:17.249
I never cared much
for moonlit skies

01:35:17.323 --> 01:35:20.451
I never winked back
at fireflies

01:35:20.527 --> 01:35:23.985
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

01:35:24.063 --> 01:35:27.430
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:31.095
And I never went in
for afterglow

01:35:31.170 --> 01:35:34.901
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

01:35:34.974 --> 01:35:38.034
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

01:35:38.111 --> 01:35:41.512
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:35:41.581 --> 01:35:45.847
You know, I used to ramble
through the park

01:35:45.919 --> 01:35:49.480
Shadowboxin' in the dark

01:35:49.556 --> 01:35:52.582
Then you came
and lit that spark

01:35:52.659 --> 01:35:55.685
That's a four-alarm fire now

01:35:55.762 --> 01:35:59.755
And I never made love
by lantern shine

01:35:59.832 --> 01:36:03.461
Never saw rainbows
in my wine

01:36:03.536 --> 01:36:06.562
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

01:36:06.639 --> 01:36:09.267
I'm beginnin'

01:36:09.342 --> 01:36:12.641
Mm, to see the light

01:36:13.305 --> 01:36:19.326
