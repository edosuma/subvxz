01:23.873 --> 01:25.706
Let's have
the back now, Carter.

01:25.708 --> 01:26.709
Copy that.

02:10.686 --> 02:12.586
Gentlemen, good morning.

02:12.588 --> 02:15.589
I'm so sorry, but I'm afraid
you've had a wasted trip.

02:15.591 --> 02:17.925
Mrs. Burgess
passed away this morning.

02:17.927 --> 02:20.894
Oh. Understood.

02:20.896 --> 02:23.764
Oh, well. My sincere
condolences, Mr. Burgess.

02:23.766 --> 02:25.399
But I'm afraid it's back
to the nick with you.

02:25.401 --> 02:27.334
I'd like to see her,
if it's all the same.

02:27.336 --> 02:29.806
What's the point?
She's dead.

02:31.607 --> 02:33.943
I'd like to see my mother.

04:11.141 --> 04:13.473
Hold on, mate.
Members only.

04:13.475 --> 04:17.880
- Yeah, I'm a member.
- We're closed. Fuck off.

04:31.460 --> 04:34.195
Enjoy.

04:34.197 --> 04:35.865
Cheers, mate.

04:44.573 --> 04:47.075
You look like a man who could
do some wishful drinking.

04:47.077 --> 04:48.508
What can I get
for you, my love?

04:48.510 --> 04:50.011
Oh, I dunno.

04:50.013 --> 04:51.880
What you got on tap
that's decent?

04:51.882 --> 04:54.681
It's a members' club,
not the fucking Ritz, darling.

04:54.683 --> 04:57.885
- Just what you see.
- All right, I'll have anything with a hefty head then, please.

04:57.887 --> 05:03.894
Yeah, I think I can do that. Been behind
this bar since you were in short trousers.

05:07.563 --> 05:11.966
- Not seen you in here before.
- I don't get out much.

05:11.968 --> 05:14.702
Oh, I bet you're the life
and soul of the party, are ya?

05:14.704 --> 05:17.238
Do you know what?
I do have my moments.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.673
Keep the change.

05:19.675 --> 05:20.876
Cheers.

05:22.578 --> 05:24.979
Everyone's spooked.
Everyone.

05:24.981 --> 05:28.216
Even Hyde's moved
his office upstairs.

05:28.218 --> 05:31.818
And Lincoln said he don't want no one out on
the streets till this has been cleared up.

05:31.820 --> 05:33.654
We're on curfew 'cause Rook
couldn't handle his shit

05:33.656 --> 05:35.857
against some nutter
with a blade?

05:35.859 --> 05:38.492
It was a fuckin' axe.
And no.

05:38.494 --> 05:41.562
We're on a curfew 'cause,
one, Stokes is gone missing,

05:41.564 --> 05:45.766
and two,
that nutter killed Rook.

05:45.768 --> 05:48.635
Well, we all feel bad for him, bro.
But I've got a business to run.

05:48.637 --> 05:51.105
Rook would be the first
to agree with me,

05:51.107 --> 05:53.740
because whilst he was
a bit of sadistic cunt,

05:53.742 --> 05:56.177
he was first
and foremost a professional.

05:56.179 --> 06:00.248
Did you hear
what happened to him?

06:00.250 --> 06:04.052
You do you know
about the hand, don't ya?

06:04.054 --> 06:06.720
- What hand?
- For fuck's sake.

06:06.722 --> 06:08.755
Oi, Tune.

06:08.757 --> 06:11.059
Come and tell Vern here
what happened to you and Rook.

06:11.061 --> 06:15.029
- Why? What do you wanna know?
- Just tell him what happened!

06:17.599 --> 06:19.866
See, me and Rook, you know,
we're standin' on the corner.

06:19.868 --> 06:21.568
And we're slingin'
a bit of Scooby.

06:21.570 --> 06:23.137
You know,
standard Tuesday night.

06:23.139 --> 06:25.173
And all of a sudden,
we clock this geezer.

06:25.175 --> 06:27.575
You know, standing on
the other side of the road.

06:27.577 --> 06:29.743
And he's eye-fuckin' us.
Yeah.

06:29.745 --> 06:31.980
So Rook turns around, he says he's
gonna go and have a quick word.

06:31.982 --> 06:34.949
Now, I can't do nothin' about it.
I've got customers to deal with.

06:34.951 --> 06:39.687
Next thing, Rook is on his hands
and knees, holdin' his arm.

06:39.689 --> 06:44.691
I realize he's had his fucking
hand cut off by this nutter.

06:44.693 --> 06:48.629
Yeah? So obviously I goes fucking
running over, ready to smash his face in,

06:48.631 --> 06:50.231
and this guy shits himself
and runs.

06:50.233 --> 06:52.066
Obviously, I give chase,

06:52.068 --> 06:53.633
but this guy's fast, right?

06:53.635 --> 06:55.769
He's, I mean, crackhead fast.

06:55.771 --> 06:58.339
So I realize I've left Rook in
the middle of the fuckin' street.

06:58.341 --> 07:02.577
But by the time I get back,
he's fuckin' dead.

07:02.579 --> 07:05.013
There's blood everywhere. I
couldn't find his fuckin' hand.

07:05.015 --> 07:11.652
Like, just gone. Vanished.

07:11.654 --> 07:13.654
Yeah, what's with the laugh,
mate?

07:13.656 --> 07:16.057
Don't mind me, pal.
Don't mind me.

07:16.059 --> 07:18.725
Who's this prick?

07:18.727 --> 07:24.098
You must
be a tough guy then, yeah?

07:24.100 --> 07:26.768
Chasin' that bloke away
all by yourself.

07:26.770 --> 07:29.104
It's funny, that. You don't
look like a tough guy to me.

07:29.106 --> 07:30.670
Well, what's a fucking tough guy
look like then?!

07:30.672 --> 07:32.206
Well,
they look like me, don't they?

07:32.208 --> 07:34.675
You know, handsome, well-aged.

07:34.677 --> 07:37.312
Yo, Bez!
Who the fuckin' hell's this?

07:37.314 --> 07:40.249
I dunno. He didn't say his name.
Cliff let him in.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.715
I thought he was part
of the firm.

07:41.717 --> 07:43.151
I'm an old friend of Lincoln's.

07:43.153 --> 07:45.253
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, that's right, mate.

07:45.255 --> 07:47.789
How'd you
fuck up your face so bad?

07:47.791 --> 07:49.157
Playing with your dildo, was it?

07:49.159 --> 07:50.758
Yeah,
borrowed it off your dad, mate.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.028
Well, he's got some
fucking front, don't he?

07:53.030 --> 07:56.998
Not as much as you, judging by that
fuckin' yarn you were just spinnin'.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.766
Cor, he's doin' you
right out there, Tune.

07:58.768 --> 08:00.201
You weren't fuckin' there,
right?!

08:00.203 --> 08:02.703
- Just shut up!
- Oi! Simmer down, yeah?

08:02.705 --> 08:04.073
Don't make me
call last orders early.

08:04.075 --> 08:05.940
And you,
stop winding him up.

08:05.942 --> 08:07.408
Or you can get the fuck out!

08:07.410 --> 08:09.277
All right, all right.
I'll apologize.

08:09.279 --> 08:11.045
Lads, lads,
I'm sorry, all right?

08:11.047 --> 08:13.648
I'm just havin' a laugh with ya,
yeah? A bit of a giggle.

08:13.650 --> 08:16.218
I'll finish my beer
and be on my way.

08:16.220 --> 08:20.321
Yeah, right along...
dickhead.

08:20.323 --> 08:22.890
- Enough.
- What the fuck?!

08:22.892 --> 08:24.659
What do you know about
Frankenstein's monster over there?

08:24.661 --> 08:26.060
I never seen
the freak before in my life.

08:26.062 --> 08:27.996
And I think
I'd fucking remember.

08:27.998 --> 08:30.398
Hasn't exactly got a face you
can fucking forget, is it?

08:30.400 --> 08:33.000
- He seems to have you sussed.
- What's your fucking problem?

08:33.001 --> 08:37.306
No, no, no, he's right.
If Lincoln invited him,

08:37.308 --> 08:40.808
we best just keep things civil.

08:40.809 --> 08:44.178
- So, go on.
- Go on what?

08:44.179 --> 08:47.715
- Finish the fucking story.
- Yeah, right. 'Course.

08:47.717 --> 08:51.220
So, I'm... I'm obviously standin' there.
This big, massive bag of merch.

08:51.222 --> 08:53.921
You know, Rook's lyin' in the street, dead.
Next thing, I hear

08:53.923 --> 08:56.290
the sirens comin', the police are
on the way. So I had to fuck off.

08:56.292 --> 08:58.059
- Do you know what I mean?
- Bollocks!

08:58.061 --> 08:59.927
You were long gone
way before they arrived.

08:59.929 --> 09:02.464
- What?!
- Ran off shitting bricks, you did.

09:02.466 --> 09:05.967
- Do you want me cave your fucking face opened up again?
- Oh, here we go!

09:05.969 --> 09:08.769
Finally found your ball,
did ya, mate? Yeah?

09:08.771 --> 09:12.006
Don't you think it's about time
you told your mates the truth?

09:12.008 --> 09:14.842
Tune,
what's he goin' on about?

09:14.844 --> 09:18.379
Yeah, Tune,
what am I goin' on about?

09:18.381 --> 09:21.182
I dunno. His head's fucked, Mo!
I dunno, he's fuckin' twisted.

09:21.184 --> 09:23.951
Well, you wanna hear my
twisted take on this tale?

09:23.953 --> 09:27.389
- Not really, chap.
- Well, fucking humor me!

09:27.391 --> 09:30.093
At least whilst
I finish my pint.

09:31.461 --> 09:33.227
'Cause there was a bloke
standing staring at you.

09:33.229 --> 09:34.929
That much is true.

09:34.931 --> 09:37.299
Yeah, Rook.
Check out Bill.

09:37.301 --> 09:40.269
He's been eye-fuckin' us
for the past ten minutes.

09:40.271 --> 09:43.873
Yo, bruv!
Can we help you with somethin'?

09:49.380 --> 09:52.114
Mate, you deaf?!

09:52.116 --> 09:54.918
I'm fuckin' talkin' to you,
mate. What do you want?

09:57.153 --> 09:59.454
- Sorry, mate, but...
- Am I supposed to be scared?

09:59.456 --> 10:01.756
- Here, go ahead.
- Huh?

10:01.758 --> 10:03.859
Makes a change,
you fuckin' paying.

10:03.861 --> 10:06.196
It's good. Fuck off.

10:07.764 --> 10:10.831
Look,
just fuck off, yeah? Ah!

10:15.139 --> 10:19.173
Fuckin' hell!

10:19.175 --> 10:21.943
Nah, that's bollocks. You know
I'd never run from a fight.

10:21.945 --> 10:24.845
- Just this once then, eh, Tuney?
- Oh, fuck off, you wanker!

10:24.847 --> 10:27.349
- So you killed Rook?
- Yeah, that's right, mate.

10:27.351 --> 10:30.251
What the fuck
are you gonna do about it?

10:30.253 --> 10:33.455
Well, clearly you're only
interested in one thing.

10:33.457 --> 10:36.024
Oi.
It's time for you to leave.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.859
I've still
got half a pint left, love.

10:37.861 --> 10:41.963
Yeah, my pub, my pints.
Get out!

10:41.965 --> 10:44.832
Come here, you fuckin' wanker!

10:49.573 --> 10:54.875
Get the fuck back!
Oi, get over there! Move it!

10:54.877 --> 10:57.945
Anyone else make a move on me,
I'll kill 'em!

10:57.947 --> 11:01.318
Swear to fucking Christ!
Get away from that door!

11:05.256 --> 11:07.389
Where is he?

11:07.391 --> 11:09.224
- Where the fuck is he?!
- Who?!

11:09.226 --> 11:11.994
- Lincoln!
- How is this low-key,

11:11.996 --> 11:14.365
you stupid, noisy...

11:15.866 --> 11:19.936
Come here! Turn around!

11:21.838 --> 11:23.405
Get over there.

11:23.407 --> 11:25.876
You got anyone else up there?!

11:29.912 --> 11:33.284
You remind me
of someone.

11:35.386 --> 11:37.953
- All right.
- But you can't be him,

11:37.955 --> 11:41.856
'cause he's on a long stretch,
and he was a little melt.

11:41.858 --> 11:45.594
Fuck me.

11:45.596 --> 11:47.963
The prodigal brother returns.

11:47.965 --> 11:50.365
What rock did you
crawl out from under?

11:50.367 --> 11:53.635
HMP Belmarsh,
like you didn't know.

11:53.637 --> 11:59.007
- Who the fuck is this joker?
- Well, ladies. This is Cain Burgess.

11:59.009 --> 12:02.077
Lincoln's little baby brother.

12:02.079 --> 12:04.514
Are you jokin'?
What, this nutter?!

12:04.516 --> 12:07.349
Did a job for us few years ago.
Cocked it up.

12:07.351 --> 12:11.253
- Went down for five years.
- Seven years now.

12:11.255 --> 12:13.121
Is that where
they redecorated your face?

12:13.123 --> 12:16.224
Fuck me. Looks like someone
set fire to your head

12:16.226 --> 12:19.093
and put it out with a shovel.
Still, not all bad, eh?

12:19.095 --> 12:22.230
Must have liked all that cock.

12:29.139 --> 12:32.441
All right! Looks like
we're havin' a lock-in, Bez!

12:32.443 --> 12:34.609
So do me a favor.

12:34.611 --> 12:38.681
Rustle me up another one
of your perfectly-poured pints.

12:38.683 --> 12:42.584
- Please.
- That's better. Only takes a moment to be courteous.

12:42.586 --> 12:44.553
Ya little cunt.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.621
- Mind your language, Beryl.
- Beryl?

12:46.623 --> 12:50.025
Do I look like I was born
in the '20s, ya cheeky git?

12:50.027 --> 12:51.627
- It's Bez.
- Yeah, all right. Bez then.

12:51.629 --> 12:53.961
Could be short for Beryl,
couldn't it?

12:53.963 --> 12:56.131
I used to blush as a kid.
Got called Strawberry,

12:56.133 --> 12:59.935
and then it got trimmed down to Berry.
Ended up as Bez.

12:59.937 --> 13:03.639
- I don't blush now, darlin'.
- Yeah, I bet you don't.

13:03.641 --> 13:05.607
- Ahh!
- Get back!

13:05.609 --> 13:08.477
Get back! I fuckin' told you
what would happen, didn't I?

13:11.382 --> 13:14.950
Oh, fuck!

13:14.952 --> 13:16.086
All right!

13:18.222 --> 13:21.590
You've done my leg!

13:21.592 --> 13:25.026
Mobile phones!
One from each of ya.

13:25.028 --> 13:28.029
Throw them in there, or the person next to you

13:28.031 --> 13:31.466
gets fuckin' kneecapped.
Do it! Come on!

13:34.338 --> 13:36.739
Can't fucking hear myself think!
Shut up!

13:36.741 --> 13:40.041
Well, to be fair, you have just blown
his foot off. It will sting a bit.

13:46.383 --> 13:50.420
That's nice.
Nice and quiet.

13:50.422 --> 13:54.289
Hyde, this cunt
reckons he killed Rook.

13:54.291 --> 13:58.093
Really?
Well, Tune, you chased 'im off.

13:58.095 --> 14:02.197
- You recognize him?
- No. He's full of shit, Hyde.

14:02.199 --> 14:04.634
- What do you say to that, Cain?
- You think I'm full of shit, do you?

14:04.636 --> 14:06.034
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:06.036 --> 14:09.271
You're full of shit, apparently.

14:09.273 --> 14:15.979
Your mate Rook had a chunky chess
piece inked on his hand, yeah?

14:20.350 --> 14:23.453
- Open it.
- Fuck that.

14:23.455 --> 14:26.355
- I said open it!
- I'll do it.

14:26.357 --> 14:28.758
No! No. He needs to do it.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.426
Open it, you fuckin' pigmy!
Go on.

14:31.428 --> 14:34.131
- Do it.
- All right.

14:37.535 --> 14:39.170
That's it.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.545
Jesus fucking Christ!
You're fucking mad, mate!

14:49.547 --> 14:51.714
- Oh, dear, Cain.
- Well, I guess that clears up

14:51.716 --> 14:55.350
- the whole "How full of shit am I?" debate.
- What have you done?

14:55.352 --> 14:58.723
So how about we have a nice little
breather? Why don't you gents take a seat?

15:00.157 --> 15:02.492
Come on, sit down!

15:02.494 --> 15:05.760
Fucking sit down, mate. You eyeball
me, I'll blow your fuckin' head off.

15:05.762 --> 15:08.163
Sit down.

15:08.165 --> 15:10.298
All right, Bez,
drinks all 'round.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.269
You can put 'em on Hyde's tab.

15:13.271 --> 15:15.738
- He ain't got a tab, love.
- Hm.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.706
I dunno whether you've been
payin' attention or not.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.307
I've got a big fuckin' gun
in my hand,

15:19.309 --> 15:21.477
and I'm not afraid to use it.

15:21.479 --> 15:24.213
Hate to piss on your chips, darlin',
but this ain't the first time

15:24.215 --> 15:27.283
I've looked
into that end of a shooter.

15:27.285 --> 15:32.555
Be reasonable, Bez. Do us all
a round of drinks. Please.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.824
Yeah, Bez,
will you get us one of them

15:34.826 --> 15:36.526
Rooster Rojos as well, please?

15:36.528 --> 15:37.660
You'll get what
you're fucking given. All right?

15:37.662 --> 15:39.428
Yeah, 'course. Yeah.

15:39.430 --> 15:43.267
Now, I'll have a Rooster Rojo.

15:46.103 --> 15:47.772
So...

15:49.807 --> 15:53.241
...prison turned you into
a stone-cold killer, did it?

15:53.243 --> 15:57.749
Nah, prison didn't.
You and my brother did.

16:01.553 --> 16:03.822
You wanna know what I think?

16:05.489 --> 16:08.526
Fuckin' sit down! Fuck off!

16:17.669 --> 16:23.306
I'm gonna take pleasure...
crackin' your fuckin' skull open.

16:23.308 --> 16:26.175
But you know what?
That can wait.

16:26.177 --> 16:28.845
And I got pretty
good at waitin'.

16:28.847 --> 16:31.514
Get your phone out.

16:31.516 --> 16:33.783
You're gonna tell 'im
to get down here, right now.

16:33.785 --> 16:37.320
You're gonna tell 'im it's about
Rook, and then you're gonna hang up.

16:40.191 --> 16:44.694
Yeah, it's me. Need you
to come down to the Jockey.

16:44.696 --> 16:48.833
We got a situation.
It's about Rook.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.404
Good boy.

16:56.874 --> 16:59.475
Hyde. Please tell me it
was you and all the lads

16:59.477 --> 17:02.815
- that gave that cunt all his scars.
- Oh, I'm sorry, mate.

17:04.248 --> 17:06.247
But I wish it was.

17:06.249 --> 17:08.550
Oh, you wanna know how
I got these scars, do ya?

17:08.553 --> 17:10.720
Oh, yeah. Enlighten us.

17:10.722 --> 17:13.455
You and my brother
may as well have carved

17:13.458 --> 17:16.760
each one of these scars
into my flesh.

17:16.762 --> 17:19.595
Where have you been hiding yourself these days, Cain?

17:19.597 --> 17:22.464
- We haven't seen you in ages.
- I thought I better not show my face

17:22.467 --> 17:23.898
around for a bit,
you know how I mean?

17:23.901 --> 17:25.601
Need to talk to my brother,
though.

17:25.603 --> 17:26.703
Got a great business deal
for 'im.

17:26.704 --> 17:28.872
You hear that?

17:28.874 --> 17:31.641
Perhaps you should give the lad a shot.
He's on the up-and-up.

17:31.643 --> 17:35.478
Doesn't know the meaning of dishonesty.
Couldn't even throw a fight.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.581
The up-and-up?
The fuck-up, more like.

17:38.583 --> 17:42.585
All you had to do
was lose a fight.

17:42.587 --> 17:44.754
- Lost me a packet.
- Do you know what, Rook?

17:44.756 --> 17:46.589
I don't think I heard
what you just called me.

17:46.591 --> 17:48.357
Do you, uh, do you wanna say
that again, mate?

17:48.359 --> 17:50.794
- You heard.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

17:50.796 --> 17:53.328
You lost a packet,
you dumped five large.

17:53.330 --> 17:55.833
I dumped 15 large.

17:57.502 --> 17:59.301
What is it you wanted from me?

17:59.303 --> 18:00.837
Is it all right if I have a word
with you outside?

18:00.839 --> 18:03.874
You mad? I'm in the middle
of a card game.

18:03.876 --> 18:07.777
You got something' you wanna
ask me, let's hear it.

18:07.779 --> 18:10.949
All right.

18:13.852 --> 18:15.919
I've got
a business proposition for ya.

18:15.921 --> 18:18.921
It's, uh, it's a good deal. Been
talkin' it through with Mum,

18:18.923 --> 18:20.990
- and she thinks it could be a real winner.
- Mum?

18:20.992 --> 18:23.526
- Yeah.
- Well, you know I love our mum.

18:23.528 --> 18:26.665
Means more to me
than life itself.

18:28.266 --> 18:31.300
But since when
has her business acumen

18:31.302 --> 18:34.037
got anything to do
with what I fuckin' do?

18:34.039 --> 18:35.806
Well, you remember Sulley
from the gym, right?

18:35.808 --> 18:38.709
Yeah, Old Sulley,
he's jackin' it in.

18:38.711 --> 18:40.811
So I made him an offer,
he's accepted. Right?

18:40.813 --> 18:43.913
It's a good deal, real good deal.
Just need the start-up capital.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.449
Which is where you come in, of
course, but I've got a business plan

18:46.451 --> 18:48.852
- written up and everything.
- Should be a laugh.

18:48.854 --> 18:50.987
Let's hear it.

18:50.989 --> 18:56.459
Cain, I have a few very simple
rules that I live my life by.

18:56.461 --> 18:58.829
And they've served me
double well over the years.

18:58.831 --> 19:01.464
One of 'em is never, ever,
ever lend money to family.

19:01.466 --> 19:03.066
It's a good plan now, right?
I'm tellin' ya,

19:03.068 --> 19:05.301
I could go through it with you
right now if you want.

19:05.303 --> 19:10.573
No. Because
I'm gonna pass, mate.

19:10.575 --> 19:13.510
You see, little bruv,
lending money is what I do.

19:13.512 --> 19:16.046
- I know.
- I mean, what happens if you can't pay me back,

19:16.048 --> 19:19.615
and your business plan
goes fucking backside?

19:19.617 --> 19:21.885
We don't wanna come after you
and seriously hurt you.

19:21.887 --> 19:25.489
- Oh, come off it, mate.
- Gyms come and go, mate.

19:25.491 --> 19:28.924
What makes yours so fuckin' special?
Not your star-studded career.

19:28.926 --> 19:32.428
Please don't tell me that,
because you fucked up.

19:32.430 --> 19:37.467
You fucked up. Every one of your fans
in this room dumped proper money on you.

19:37.469 --> 19:38.902
- I know.
- Because they trusted you.

19:38.904 --> 19:40.704
- Yeah.
- And now you're coming to me,

19:40.706 --> 19:43.441
and you're askin' me
to fund your next gamble.

19:44.910 --> 19:47.878
Why do you talk to me like that?
Eh? Condescending.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.580
- You're my brother, not my fuckin' dad.
- I know, but you're comin' to me

19:50.582 --> 19:52.382
and you're askin' for money.
What do you expect?

19:52.384 --> 19:54.884
- Fuck this.
- Cain, Cain, Cain.

19:54.886 --> 19:58.922
Come on, sit down. Sit down.

19:58.924 --> 20:02.394
You always fuckin' get excited.
You and that temper.

20:03.662 --> 20:05.661
Look, I know
what you're tryin' to do.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.630
You're keepin' your nut down

20:07.632 --> 20:09.099
and you're fuckin' keepin' your
nose clean. That's a good thing.

20:09.101 --> 20:12.435
It's a really good thing,
and I'm proud of ya.

20:12.437 --> 20:14.404
But I'm tellin' you now,
if you want me to break

20:14.406 --> 20:17.673
one of my rules
and lend you money...

20:17.675 --> 20:20.977
then you're gonna
have to do something for me.

20:20.979 --> 20:23.379
I appreciate that, but I'm not lookin'
to get into anything like that.

20:23.381 --> 20:24.848
I don't want
to do anything illegal.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.650
This is the closest
you're ever gonna get

20:26.652 --> 20:28.718
to me lendin' you money.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.956
So take it or leave it.

20:33.125 --> 20:36.526
- Well, what's the job?
- Go and see Hyde.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.762
He'll fill you in everything
you need to know.

20:38.764 --> 20:41.864
And trust me,
it's a piece of piss.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.102
Not even you could fuck it up.

20:47.739 --> 20:49.573
Can we have a salesman
on the floor, please?

20:49.575 --> 20:52.409
We have a customer
interested in the Jaguar.

20:52.411 --> 20:55.411
I bet seven grand
on you losin' that fight.

20:55.413 --> 20:58.515
I was tryin' to make it
look real, wasn't I?

20:58.517 --> 21:01.051
So you knocked him out cold?

21:01.053 --> 21:03.753
In Mexico, you know what happens
to people that behave like that?

21:03.755 --> 21:07.891
They string him up under a bridge, cut off
their dick, and shove it down their mouths.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.826
- Come on, it's a bit harsh, isn't it?
- Yeah, well, you know,

21:09.828 --> 21:12.662
they're savages.
But that's not the point.

21:12.664 --> 21:15.966
It hurt,
and I don't just mean the money.

21:15.968 --> 21:18.667
- We're friends.
- Yeah, I know.

21:18.669 --> 21:21.004
Your brother tells me,
"Oh, give him another shot."

21:21.006 --> 21:23.073
But... I'm not so sure.

21:23.075 --> 21:27.044
Look, I made a mistake. Right?
It's not gonna happen again.

21:27.046 --> 21:29.478
Because my brother
is gonna vouch for me.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.214
Rook says you're
a fucking liability.

21:31.216 --> 21:33.149
Oh, well, if Rook says so,
I'll just fuck off then.

21:33.151 --> 21:35.919
Oh, sit down, princess.
Don't shit yourself.

21:35.921 --> 21:38.922
I didn't say
we weren't gonna use you.

21:38.924 --> 21:44.997
I'm just lettin' you know your
standing in terms of the establishment.

21:47.566 --> 21:51.501
- You seen one of these before?
- Blue plastic bag?

21:51.503 --> 21:53.937
- Seen a few, yeah.
- Oh, man of the world, are we?

21:53.939 --> 21:58.241
At 3:00 this afternoon,
Mabel Liddell

21:58.243 --> 22:01.645
is gonna come into this office.

22:01.647 --> 22:05.017
She's gonna
take this away with her.

22:06.184 --> 22:08.818
You are gonna follow her home

22:08.820 --> 22:11.755
to London Fields,
where she lives.

22:11.757 --> 22:13.723
You're gonna take
that bag off of her,

22:13.725 --> 22:17.160
and you're gonna
bring it back here.

22:17.162 --> 22:22.065
- Simple.
- What's in the bag?

22:22.067 --> 22:25.102
About, um...
about two and half pounds

22:25.104 --> 22:27.004
of none
of your fucking business.

22:27.006 --> 22:29.806
If she causes you any trouble,

22:29.808 --> 22:32.709
you can knock her out cold,
can't you?

22:32.711 --> 22:35.512
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah. All right then, laughing boy.

22:35.514 --> 22:38.615
Wipe the fucking smile off your
face, have a dump, wind your watch,

22:38.617 --> 22:42.652
fuck off across the street, get outta my
office, and close the door on your way out.

22:45.123 --> 22:50.027
Well, this is all very interesting,
but is it goin' anywhere?

22:50.029 --> 22:51.963
Yeah, it is, actually.

22:51.965 --> 22:54.097
You see,
because of you and my brother,

22:54.099 --> 22:56.866
I ended up goin' to prison.
Didn't I?

22:56.868 --> 22:59.536
HMP Belmarsh,
or as I came to know it,

22:59.538 --> 23:02.940
Horrible Motherfuckin'
Piss-hole Belmarsh.

23:02.942 --> 23:07.813
The filthiest, most violent and
godforsaken prison in England.

23:09.848 --> 23:12.882
Yeah, that was where
that joke of a judge sent me.

23:12.884 --> 23:16.886
I didn't have a criminal record,
I never had that mindset.

23:16.888 --> 23:19.189
You know, I couldn't even
throw a fuckin' boxing match,

23:19.191 --> 23:22.193
but they threw me in there
with those hardened murderers,

23:22.195 --> 23:25.162
rapists, serial offenders.

23:25.164 --> 23:28.834
There's a reason why they call
that place the Meatgrinder.

23:46.152 --> 23:48.820
Say excuse me, cunt.

23:49.956 --> 23:51.588
Excuse me, cunt.

25:26.452 --> 25:29.087
Jaw seems to be healing nicely.

25:32.091 --> 25:35.392
Now, they would've given you the
normal dentures if you just asked.

25:35.394 --> 25:38.996
- Yeah, I did.
- You should've said please.

25:38.998 --> 25:41.298
Now, if it bothers you
that much,

25:41.300 --> 25:43.200
when you get out of prison,
just get 'em switched.

25:43.202 --> 25:46.036
It's an easy procedure.

25:46.038 --> 25:50.007
Do you know what?
I don't mind 'em.

25:50.009 --> 25:53.076
Make me look scary as fuck.

26:04.823 --> 26:06.725
Hi, Mum.

26:11.397 --> 26:13.199
Take a seat.

26:18.904 --> 26:21.939
What happened, son?
Your teeth!

26:21.941 --> 26:25.142
Yeah, I know.
Got into a bit of a scuffle.

26:25.144 --> 26:28.778
- Why is it always you?
- It's not always me, Mum.

26:28.780 --> 26:31.448
I'm in prison, aren't I?
What do you expect?

26:31.450 --> 26:34.084
This is what I expected.

26:34.086 --> 26:38.189
I'd hoped you'd
learn something in here.

26:38.191 --> 26:39.990
Get a bit of a kick
up the backside.

26:39.992 --> 26:41.858
I'm gettin' a kick
up the backside, all right.

26:41.860 --> 26:43.227
- Don't worry about that.
- Nothing to be proud of.

26:43.229 --> 26:45.462
- I'm not proud of it.
- I'm just...

26:45.464 --> 26:47.131
worried about you, son.

26:47.133 --> 26:48.966
I don't...

26:48.968 --> 26:52.837
I don't know what to say, to do.

26:54.507 --> 26:56.974
- I spoke to another lawyer.
- Yeah?

26:56.976 --> 27:00.811
But I ain't got the money
to pay 'em. Neither do you.

27:00.813 --> 27:03.281
What's Lincoln say about it?

27:03.283 --> 27:06.350
Well, Lincoln don't talk to me
about that sort of thing.

27:06.352 --> 27:08.419
Lincoln does his own thing.

27:08.421 --> 27:10.854
Has he said anything about me?

27:10.856 --> 27:13.458
He said it's your own fault
for gettin' in trouble.

27:13.460 --> 27:18.062
- Fuck's sake, Mum!
- Don't talk to me in that language!

27:18.064 --> 27:21.065
I brung you up to be better
than the animals in here.

27:21.067 --> 27:24.034
Don't stoop to their level.

27:24.036 --> 27:28.372
- No, I'm sorry, Mum.
- Lincoln has his work.

27:28.374 --> 27:32.243
And whatever you say about him,
he ain't in jail.

27:32.245 --> 27:35.846
He ain't the one keeping me
awake at night, worryin'.

27:35.848 --> 27:37.582
Lincoln needs to come down here
and talk me, all right?

27:37.584 --> 27:41.085
You gotta tell him to come here
and talk to me.

27:41.087 --> 27:44.421
I'll tell him, son.

27:44.423 --> 27:46.759
No touching.

27:52.365 --> 27:54.200
I'm sorry, Mum.

28:04.310 --> 28:08.245
I didn't hear nothin'
off Lincoln. Not a goddamn word.

28:08.247 --> 28:11.418
- I was on my own.
- Ahh!

28:12.486 --> 28:14.185
So it was clear that I was gonna

28:14.187 --> 28:16.822
have to look after myself.

28:51.391 --> 28:54.226
Put it down!
Put it down now!

28:56.262 --> 28:59.264
I didn't fucking do anything!
They jumped me!

28:59.266 --> 29:02.300
I didn't fucking do anything!

29:02.302 --> 29:04.268
The Council finds it
reasonable to believe

29:04.270 --> 29:06.970
that you were at least in part
responsible for the incident

29:06.972 --> 29:08.506
that took place
on the 28th of June,

29:08.508 --> 29:11.643
and it thereby
finds you guilty as charged.

29:11.645 --> 29:14.145
I don't understand this, Your
Honor, what do you want me to do?

29:14.147 --> 29:17.281
They're comin' at me with a knife,
it's self-defense, clearly, right?

29:17.283 --> 29:18.982
What do you want me to do?
Let 'em stab me?

29:18.984 --> 29:20.585
- Order.
- No, I'm telling you,

29:20.587 --> 29:22.152
there's people in this prison,
they're out to get me.

29:22.154 --> 29:24.289
I need a transfer,
I need it today!

29:24.291 --> 29:27.459
Your sentence is hereby
extended by one year.

29:27.461 --> 29:33.264
Please, take the time alone to
reconsider your life decisions.

29:33.266 --> 29:35.667
I'll consider the fact
that you're a fuckin' ponce!

29:35.669 --> 29:39.137
For what?! Fuckin' defending
myself, that's for what!

29:39.139 --> 29:41.305
- You fuckin' stupid cunt!
- Come on.

29:41.307 --> 29:42.707
You haven't got a fuckin' clue,
have ya?

29:42.709 --> 29:44.642
You sit there in your fuckin'...

29:44.644 --> 29:46.009
fuckin' suit and tie, huh?

29:46.011 --> 29:47.379
You haven't got a fucking clue!

29:47.381 --> 29:49.481
Nothing
could have prepared me

29:49.483 --> 29:53.250
for the shit that I was about
to go through in this hellhole.

29:53.252 --> 29:55.119
So I had to make a choice.

29:55.121 --> 29:58.156
If I was gonna get through
this stretch in one piece...

29:58.158 --> 30:01.559
Talkin' to me, mate. Yeah?
Talkin' to me, yeah? Pa-pow!

30:01.561 --> 30:04.495
...then I was gonna
have to treat this like a fight.

30:04.497 --> 30:07.965
You fuckin' want it? Pa-pow!

30:07.967 --> 30:09.967
That's what I'm talkin' about,
mate. Yeah?

30:09.969 --> 30:12.237
Come back here, get some more!

30:12.239 --> 30:14.139
I had to change myself
into something

30:14.141 --> 30:16.306
I didn't even recognize anymore.

30:16.308 --> 30:19.644
I'll fuckin' take on both
of you! Boom, boom, boom!

30:19.646 --> 30:22.147
Wah! Fucking come on!

30:22.149 --> 30:24.716
So as the months
and the weeks rolled by,

30:24.718 --> 30:28.119
I slowly but surely

30:28.121 --> 30:31.188
turned myself into what you see
before you now.

30:31.190 --> 30:34.225
A hardened, rusty nail.

30:34.227 --> 30:37.429
You see, the body can be
strengthened to a degree,

30:37.431 --> 30:41.999
but it's your mind that
makes you impervious to defeat.

30:42.001 --> 30:44.602
Just like the skin
on your knuckles,

30:44.604 --> 30:49.742
the mind can be made
callous as fuck.

30:49.744 --> 30:53.378
Bodily pain can do that.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.647
So I learned how to take pain.

30:55.649 --> 30:57.582
But, more importantly,

30:57.584 --> 31:00.218
I learned how to dish it out.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.314
Come on, lads!

31:30.784 --> 31:35.021
Come on!

31:37.825 --> 31:41.493
You see,
the problem I had was why?

31:41.495 --> 31:44.362
Why did every fucker
in that place want me dead?

31:44.364 --> 31:47.632
I mean, it didn't make any sense to me.
I couldn't work it out.

31:47.634 --> 31:53.438
And then one day...
it all became clear.

31:56.243 --> 32:01.081
Anyone else fucking want it?
Anyone else?! Huh?!

32:02.215 --> 32:03.214
How are ya?

32:03.216 --> 32:05.583
Hey. That's it.

32:05.585 --> 32:07.452
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

32:07.454 --> 32:10.188
You're all right.
Probably a bit concussed, mate.

32:10.190 --> 32:13.124
Don't worry, you know,
the guards'll land in a minute.

32:13.126 --> 32:16.126
Nothin' personal, Cain, ya know?

32:16.128 --> 32:20.331
Nothing personal?
Why'd ya do it then? Hey?

32:20.333 --> 32:24.737
What you got to gain from havin' a fuckin'
skull fracture? Hope it was worth it, mate!

32:24.739 --> 32:28.773
It fuckin' woulda been.
Twenty grand.

32:28.775 --> 32:31.409
What ya talkin' about,
20 grand?

32:31.411 --> 32:34.579
- Ah...
- What are ya talkin' about? Twenty grand from where?!

32:34.581 --> 32:36.247
Twang was hookin' us up, yeah?

32:38.184 --> 32:39.818
I think your brother's
bank-rollin' it.

32:41.454 --> 32:44.355
What the fuck you talkin' about?
My brother?

32:44.357 --> 32:47.191
I ain't joking, yeah?
I only did it for the cash.

32:47.193 --> 32:50.128
My brother did this?!

32:50.130 --> 32:53.364
You're saying my fuckin' brother
did this? My own brother?!

32:53.366 --> 32:56.634
My own fuckin' brother?!

32:56.636 --> 32:58.737
Why'd he do it, Hyde?

32:58.739 --> 33:01.205
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

33:01.207 --> 33:02.708
I've no idea
what you're talkin' about.

33:02.710 --> 33:05.743
Don't you deny that.
Don't you fuckin' dare!

33:05.745 --> 33:10.515
You and my brother had a price
tag put on my head, didn't ya?

33:10.517 --> 33:13.586
Didn't ya?!

33:13.588 --> 33:18.156
I can accept it from a dirty,
conniving little bastard like you,

33:18.158 --> 33:21.426
but I cannot
accept that from him.

33:21.428 --> 33:25.598
Week after week they came.
One after another.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.200
Sometimes, more than one. Do you know what?
It didn't matter to me.

33:29.202 --> 33:32.203
Keep 'em comin', I said.
Bring on all comers.

33:32.205 --> 33:34.305
Come and have a fuckin' go,
mate!

33:34.307 --> 33:37.241
The more that came,
the stronger my mind got!

33:37.243 --> 33:40.714
And my daily existence
became about survival.

33:51.258 --> 33:53.326
Fucking come at me?!

33:55.963 --> 33:58.231
Come at me, then! Come on!

34:30.330 --> 34:32.465
You fucking...!

34:34.768 --> 34:37.803
- Oi!
- I bet you didn't know it's possible

34:37.804 --> 34:41.371
to make your own napalm
in prison, did ya?

34:41.373 --> 34:44.976
Well, you can.
And it fuckin' burns.

34:44.978 --> 34:49.550
Uh!

35:18.879 --> 35:24.283
We hereby find you guilty, and your sentence,
Mr. Burgess, will be extended by two years.

35:24.285 --> 35:28.856
Five weeks segregation
to commence post-haste.

35:30.758 --> 35:32.727
Fuck you.

36:11.465 --> 36:13.467
Ahh! Come on!

36:41.361 --> 36:44.496
All I have is a dead inmate,

36:44.498 --> 36:49.670
and you had his blood
on your clothes.

36:51.405 --> 36:53.739
Well, I'm adding an additional
year to your sentence

36:53.741 --> 36:55.440
for being a part
of the altercation.

36:55.442 --> 36:57.778
Likewise,
six months segregation.

37:53.667 --> 37:56.069
Fuck you!

38:23.064 --> 38:26.968
It's good to see ya,
Mum.

38:28.903 --> 38:33.739
What's it been?
About three years, is it?

38:33.741 --> 38:35.540
I did come to see you.

38:35.542 --> 38:39.178
They told me
you was in solitary.

38:39.180 --> 38:42.014
- More than once.
- Yeah.

38:42.016 --> 38:46.585
Anyway, your brother didn't...
didn't think it was a good idea.

38:46.587 --> 38:49.024
Too much stress.
And he's right.

38:50.525 --> 38:52.591
Look at ya.

38:52.593 --> 38:55.496
I don't know what you've become.

38:56.998 --> 38:59.935
Something you need
to know about Lincoln, Mum.

39:03.538 --> 39:05.271
Probably not gonna be easy
for you to hear, but...

39:05.273 --> 39:08.975
Well, there's somethin' I need
to get off me chest first.

39:08.977 --> 39:13.880
It's not easy to say,
but... I'll just say it.

39:13.882 --> 39:15.716
I've got the cancer.

39:17.718 --> 39:19.252
I've known for a few months,

39:19.254 --> 39:21.888
but I didn't want
to bother anyone.

39:21.890 --> 39:24.924
I start chemo on Tuesday.

39:24.926 --> 39:28.261
They say it
might be quite tough,

39:28.263 --> 39:32.698
so I don't think I'll be able
to get in to see you much.

39:32.700 --> 39:36.202
- I'm sorry, Mum.
- You don't have to be sorry.

39:36.204 --> 39:39.206
Your brother's looking after me.
Every day.

39:39.208 --> 39:42.710
Bless him, I don't know
what I'd do without him.

39:44.012 --> 39:46.179
We'll be okay.

39:46.181 --> 39:49.849
And what was it you wanted
to tell me about Lincoln?

39:49.851 --> 39:52.285
Oh, don't worry about that, Mum.
It's nothin'.

39:52.287 --> 39:55.321
- Oh, go on.
- No, it's...

39:55.323 --> 39:58.725
- Aw, come on.
- I'm glad Lincoln's lookin' after you.

39:58.727 --> 40:02.662
That's... that's a weight
off me shoulders, you know?

40:02.664 --> 40:05.697
Yeah, yeah. We're all fighters
in this family, aren't we?

40:05.699 --> 40:09.904
- Look at you.
- Yeah, we're fighters.

40:12.707 --> 40:14.007
Right, time's up.

40:14.009 --> 40:17.212
Come on, let's go. Come on!

40:18.645 --> 40:20.847
Never really knew
what your pancreas did

40:20.849 --> 40:23.551
till my mum's got
riddled with cancer.

40:25.354 --> 40:27.953
I still don't, really.

40:27.955 --> 40:30.722
She was a fighter, my mum.

40:30.724 --> 40:34.829
She fought that cancer longer
than anyone thought she could.

40:37.866 --> 40:41.000
So they let me out for
just five hours to go see her.

40:41.002 --> 40:46.641
Sent me with a six-man security
detail, one paddy wagon, two cars.

40:50.045 --> 40:51.879
She died
before I even got there.

40:53.248 --> 40:55.314
I didn't know.

40:55.316 --> 40:57.617
I knew she was ill.

40:57.619 --> 41:00.254
Sorry for your loss,
she was a fine woman.

41:00.256 --> 41:04.057
I did know that some lad had
done for a couple of screws

41:04.059 --> 41:08.861
and made a break from the hospital,
I just... didn't connect the dots.

41:08.863 --> 41:12.031
Maybe you shoulda done.

41:12.033 --> 41:14.834
So how the fuck
do you manage that then?

41:30.885 --> 41:35.255
Sorry about your mum.
I'm sure she was a lovely lady.

41:35.257 --> 41:38.092
But if you wanted to see her more often,
you should keep yourself outta trouble.

42:23.139 --> 42:27.740
- Can't let you go.
- It's all right, mate.

42:27.742 --> 42:30.409
You aren't gonna say anything,
are ya? Yeah?

43:19.994 --> 43:24.064
Well done. I didn't
think you had it in you.

43:24.066 --> 43:27.134
Well, I'm not the same bloke
you left out in the cold, Hyde.

43:27.136 --> 43:29.469
I don't suppose you are.

43:29.471 --> 43:32.472
Right. That's it.
I need a piss.

43:32.474 --> 43:34.975
- Go in your fuckin' trousers.
- What?!

43:34.977 --> 43:38.779
- You heard.
- That is inhumane. I've got eight pints on board!

43:38.781 --> 43:43.285
To be fair, none of us had planned
on being held hostage today.

43:45.321 --> 43:47.154
I need a piss as well.

43:47.156 --> 43:49.289
Go in one of them bottles then.

43:49.291 --> 43:53.192
- Nah. I need a shit.
- Piss in one of the bottles.

43:53.194 --> 43:56.862
- And you can shit your pants.
- Uh, might wanna rethink that.

43:56.864 --> 43:59.233
Pretty sure none of us wanna be stuck
in here breathing this one's guts.

43:59.235 --> 44:02.502
Look, whatever you're gonna do,
figure it out and do it quick.

44:02.504 --> 44:05.871
Fucking zombie-looking bastard.

44:16.485 --> 44:19.051
- Oh!
- Stop embarrassing yourself!

44:19.053 --> 44:24.057
Enough of you and your silly panto.

44:24.059 --> 44:27.194
If you're gonna do somethin',
crack on!

44:27.196 --> 44:30.330
Because I am bored
of your bullshit!

44:30.332 --> 44:33.866
Oh, you want me
to crack on, do ya? Yeah?

44:33.868 --> 44:37.273
Tell you what then,
turn around.

44:39.608 --> 44:43.978
Get on your knees. Go on.

44:44.912 --> 44:47.014
There you go.

44:47.016 --> 44:49.218
That's a good pig.

44:51.120 --> 44:55.021
When my brother gets here,
we'll kick things off nicely.

44:55.023 --> 44:59.293
But until then, do me a favor
and shut your fuckin' mouth.

44:59.295 --> 45:01.928
Or you'll be next.

45:01.930 --> 45:05.867
You know, I don't
remember you being so drappy.

45:07.069 --> 45:10.506
Or so gangsta.

45:14.076 --> 45:17.379
Oh, I've come a long way
since the blue bag day.

45:19.648 --> 45:23.483
When you sent me to steal
from Mabel Liddell,

45:23.485 --> 45:26.989
I coulda never imagined
where it woulda led me to.

45:43.972 --> 45:47.109
Don't know why you're
fuckin' runnin', love!

45:59.521 --> 46:01.589
Well, I'll leave you the purse,
all right?

46:01.591 --> 46:03.092
But I'm keepin' the bag!

46:23.045 --> 46:25.214
Oh!

47:03.119 --> 47:06.153
Mabel Liddell.

47:06.155 --> 47:11.091
Forty-nine, mother of three.

47:11.093 --> 47:13.528
Grandmother of two.

47:13.530 --> 47:17.297
Worked as a dinner lady
at the local comprehensive.

47:17.299 --> 47:23.573
Died earlier this evening whilst undergoing
surgery related to a traffic accident.

47:25.608 --> 47:28.742
- Wasn't my fault.
- You stole her purse, mate.

47:28.744 --> 47:31.411
She chased you, and she ran into traffic.
That's a manslaughter charge.

47:31.413 --> 47:34.515
That and the robbery, well,
they'll put you away for this, Cain.

47:34.517 --> 47:37.520
But... we're not really
interested in that, mate.

47:41.023 --> 47:43.356
Does the term "cuckoo"
mean anything to you?

47:43.358 --> 47:45.025
Cuckoo?

47:45.027 --> 47:47.060
As in the fuckin' bird
that can't build a nest,

47:47.062 --> 47:48.629
so it steals one
from another fuckin' bird.

47:48.631 --> 47:51.131
Oh, right, yeah.
That cuckoo.

47:51.133 --> 47:52.632
Means fuck all to me, mate.

47:52.634 --> 47:55.035
So your brother
runs the largest entrapment

47:55.037 --> 47:57.103
and cuckoo scam in the city.
The last three years,

47:57.105 --> 48:00.073
we've been working with people
who your brother's persecuted.

48:00.075 --> 48:03.276
Mabel Liddell refused to cooperate.
But we were observing her.

48:03.278 --> 48:07.113
Which means you're kinda fucked.
Doesn't it, mate?

48:07.115 --> 48:10.050
- I want a lawyer.
- You're incommunicado, boyo.

48:10.052 --> 48:13.221
You don't get a bloody lawyer.

48:13.223 --> 48:15.789
Usually starts
with a single family member.

48:15.791 --> 48:18.793
Black sheep, idiot brother.
You know, your type.

48:18.795 --> 48:23.431
Lincoln, Hyde, any of these
other heavies that we know of,

48:23.433 --> 48:26.200
they'll end up paying the family
a little visit one day.

48:26.202 --> 48:29.302
And they'll say, "Well,
so-and-so owes us a little money.

48:29.304 --> 48:31.572
And he's in line
for a little belting.

48:31.574 --> 48:34.140
But if you run us this little
errand, we'll let him off."

48:34.142 --> 48:36.744
Family's too happy to oblige,
aren't they?

48:36.746 --> 48:40.347
Give 'em a little package. Tell 'em that there's
some drugs or some money in the package

48:40.349 --> 48:42.415
and tell 'em to go
to such-and-such address.

48:42.417 --> 48:44.452
What they don't tell 'em
is they hire another hoodlum

48:44.454 --> 48:46.821
to rob them on the way, mate.
Right?

48:46.823 --> 48:49.590
All of a sudden, there's a catastrophic
amount of money in that package.

48:49.592 --> 48:53.260
Now, this is the entrapment part.
The gang members want more, don't they?

48:53.262 --> 48:56.096
So they show up
at the fuckin' house. Yeah?

48:56.098 --> 48:59.300
They want the dole, they want the
check, they want the cash.

48:59.302 --> 49:01.836
They take the fuckin' car.
They move into the house.

49:01.838 --> 49:04.805
They run the operations from the house,
and they use the car to run the errands.

49:04.807 --> 49:08.676
They stay on the property until
all the assets have been destroyed.

49:08.678 --> 49:11.746
And then they just move
onto the next.

49:11.748 --> 49:17.317
Your brother, he does this.
Hyde does this.

49:17.319 --> 49:20.454
- And you fuckin' do it too.
- The fuck I do!

49:20.456 --> 49:23.159
Got no idea what
you're talkin' about, mate.

49:27.764 --> 49:31.632
"Albert Mitchell,
Pete Singlehurst, James Webb,

49:31.634 --> 49:35.303
Eric Godley, Sandy Park,
Miriam Silverman,

49:35.305 --> 49:36.872
and now Mabel Liddell."

49:36.874 --> 49:39.306
There's a 150
or so other families.

49:39.308 --> 49:41.141
Children have been orphaned

49:41.143 --> 49:42.577
because of your brother's
fuckin' business.

49:42.579 --> 49:44.278
So you listen to me.

49:44.280 --> 49:46.547
And you listen
to me very carefully.

49:46.549 --> 49:50.686
Manslaughter and robbery are the
least of your fuckin' problems, mate.

49:50.688 --> 49:52.720
I'm throwin'
organized crime at you.

49:52.722 --> 49:54.822
I want a fuckin' lawyer,
all right?

49:54.824 --> 49:56.457
You listenin' to me?
I want a lawyer!

49:56.459 --> 49:58.726
I don't know
anything about this shit!

49:58.728 --> 50:01.596
- What about my rights?!
- Your rights are to give up your brother, mate.

50:01.598 --> 50:04.665
Thems the only rights
you fuckin' have.

50:04.667 --> 50:07.435
This operation implodes
without your brother.

50:07.437 --> 50:12.206
Maybe then a hundred or so other
people can move on with their lives.

50:12.208 --> 50:15.241
Come on, mate.
Give me your brother.

50:15.243 --> 50:18.715
Let's just
finish this right now.

50:20.917 --> 50:25.620
How about... bollocks?

50:25.622 --> 50:27.555
How about that?

50:27.557 --> 50:29.790
You're choosing the hard road,

50:29.792 --> 50:34.662
because you're goin' away
for a very, very long time.

50:34.664 --> 50:36.767
Sarge!

50:39.401 --> 50:42.269
Come on in, Cain. Let's have
a little you-and-me time.

50:42.271 --> 50:44.641
I don't know anything
about this.

51:03.258 --> 51:05.726
Oh, I've got the devil
in me, too, Cain.

51:05.728 --> 51:08.496
But I learned
to accept my wickedness.

51:08.498 --> 51:12.433
I learnt to apply it for good.

51:12.435 --> 51:17.238
You see, I have always
been good with my fists.

51:17.240 --> 51:21.642
O'Hara do this to everyone who doesn't just
bend over and get fucked then, does he?

51:21.644 --> 51:23.577
Oh, he wouldn't approve of this.

51:23.579 --> 51:27.415
But then we don't have to
tell him everything, now do we?

51:34.390 --> 51:35.724
I don't care
if you are the plod. All right.

51:35.726 --> 51:36.825
If you touch me again,

51:36.827 --> 51:38.727
I'll fuckin' wreck you, tough!

51:38.729 --> 51:41.262
How do you do that with your
hands cuffed behind your back?

52:00.818 --> 52:03.718
Filthy boy.
Look what you've done.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.721
You've gone and messed up my
nice interrogation room floor.

52:06.723 --> 52:10.025
Do you know what we do to cats
that piss on the carpet?

52:10.027 --> 52:13.360
We rub their dirty,
fuckin' noses in it!

52:16.332 --> 52:18.899
Not so damned lippy now,
are you, boy?

52:18.901 --> 52:21.004
I'm gonna hurt you, Cain.

52:23.841 --> 52:26.074
Open up!

52:26.076 --> 52:28.909
Open these fuckin' doors. Why are they bolted?!

52:28.911 --> 52:33.081
About fuckin' time. Bez!
Unbolt them doors.

52:33.083 --> 52:35.483
Don't do anything stupid.

52:35.485 --> 52:37.688
Come on.

52:44.594 --> 52:46.828
What's happening? Why are
these fuckin' doors shut?

52:46.830 --> 52:50.965
All right, lads.
Come on in. Don't be shy!

52:50.967 --> 52:53.101
Make yourselves at home.

52:53.103 --> 52:57.005
Bez, shut those fuckin' doors now!
You're not going anywhere!

52:57.007 --> 53:00.341
Do it!

53:00.343 --> 53:02.843
I can't believe this.
So good to see you, brother.

53:02.845 --> 53:05.846
The only thing
that matters is you're out.

53:05.848 --> 53:10.351
And you've come to me for help. I'm your
brother. What's family for, after all.

53:10.353 --> 53:12.921
Get back! Get back!

53:12.923 --> 53:15.389
You think I'm gonna
fall for that, do ya?

53:15.391 --> 53:19.560
Weapons, mobile phones.
Put 'em on the bar!

53:19.562 --> 53:22.063
That means all of you!
Come on!

53:22.065 --> 53:25.400
On the fuckin' bar!

53:25.402 --> 53:27.701
Drop your trousers,
lift up your shirts.

53:27.703 --> 53:29.436
Fuck off, you ain't serious.
We're not in prison.

53:29.438 --> 53:32.508
- I'm not one of your boyfriends.
- Fuckin' do it.

53:33.644 --> 53:35.646
Do it!

53:46.023 --> 53:50.458
- You happy now?
- Not just yet.

53:50.460 --> 53:52.095
Go over there with the others.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.401
Bez, do me a favor.

53:59.403 --> 54:02.104
Do us another pint with
a nice, hefty head, would ya?

54:02.106 --> 54:03.906
Please!

54:06.009 --> 54:08.743
Why don't you just take that gun off
of Hyde's head and put it back on me?

54:08.745 --> 54:10.478
Shut up!

54:10.480 --> 54:12.581
You're not the one in charge
'round here anymore.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.748
I am.

54:14.750 --> 54:17.118
Might have these monkeys eatin'
out of the palm of your hand,

54:17.120 --> 54:18.920
but I know the real you,
don't I?

54:18.922 --> 54:21.790
The cry baby that I pissed on
from the top of the tree.

54:21.792 --> 54:23.458
Do you remember that?

54:23.460 --> 54:26.428
Well, I'm back up
that tree again, bitch.

54:26.430 --> 54:29.865
Yeah, I remember that.
I fuckin' remember it vividly.

54:29.867 --> 54:33.201
And I remember how I fuckin' beat
the life out of you for doin' it.

54:33.203 --> 54:37.505
That was then. This is now.

54:42.846 --> 54:45.513
Seven years
since I've had a pint.

54:45.515 --> 54:47.384
I'm playin' catch-up.

54:48.652 --> 54:50.552
Is he all right?

54:50.554 --> 54:51.987
He's unconscious.

54:51.989 --> 54:54.189
He was in a lot of pain.

54:54.191 --> 54:56.860
He's probably better like that.

55:01.966 --> 55:04.498
- He's dead.
- You fuck!

55:04.500 --> 55:08.603
Fuckin' hell, this is bad.
This is so fuckin' bad!

55:08.605 --> 55:11.006
Dumb cunt
killed Rook too, boss.

55:11.008 --> 55:14.143
- He done what?
- Yeah. He tried to kill me and all.

55:14.145 --> 55:17.178
Then he comes in here and throws
Rook's hand on the fuckin' table!

55:17.180 --> 55:19.214
Cain, you're not
thinkin' straight.

55:19.216 --> 55:21.716
You are not fuckin'
thinkin' straight.

55:21.718 --> 55:22.984
D'you realize what you're doin'?

55:22.986 --> 55:24.886
Yeah, I realize what I'm doin'.

55:24.888 --> 55:27.923
And let me tell you why.
For the last seven years,

55:27.925 --> 55:33.262
I've been livin' with the threat of
violence hangin' over my head 24-fuckin'-7,

55:33.264 --> 55:36.698
never knowing where it's
comin' from, who it's gonna be.

55:36.700 --> 55:38.800
I've been stabbed
half a dozen times.

55:38.802 --> 55:41.970
I've had me bones broken,
me ligaments torn.

55:41.972 --> 55:44.973
I've killed people, Lincoln.

55:44.975 --> 55:47.176
With my bare fuckin' hands.

55:47.178 --> 55:49.178
Prison's rehabilitated
you well, son.

55:49.180 --> 55:52.247
Yeah?!
Have you seen this scar?

55:52.249 --> 55:55.250
What about that, have you seen that?
Do you know what that is, mate?

55:55.252 --> 55:57.186
Do you know what they call that?

55:57.188 --> 56:00.588
It's what they call
a "napalm scar," that.

56:00.590 --> 56:02.590
What about these fuckin' teeth?
Do you know what?

56:02.592 --> 56:04.893
I wanted them to give me some of
them nice, white porcelain ones.

56:04.895 --> 56:08.630
But the prison dentist gave me
these fucked up amalgam ones

56:08.632 --> 56:10.665
because of my attitude!

56:10.667 --> 56:13.169
Yeah but, you see, you do have
a problem with your attitude.

56:13.171 --> 56:16.738
Oh, fuck!
Stop doing that!

56:16.740 --> 56:18.873
Look at you.
You're a loose cannon.

56:18.875 --> 56:21.743
Prison's turned you into
a fuckin' psychopathic killer.

56:21.745 --> 56:24.113
Prison didn't!
You fuckin' did!

56:24.115 --> 56:26.848
When you put a 20,000-pound
price tag on my head

56:26.850 --> 56:29.050
in a prison full of rapists
and killers,

56:29.052 --> 56:31.152
who'd fuckin' strangle you
for a pack of cigarettes!

56:31.154 --> 56:33.888
- You did!
- What do you fuckin' expect,

56:33.890 --> 56:36.058
when you start
fucking grassin'?

56:36.060 --> 56:38.693
That we're just gonna fuckin' lay
down and let you fuckin' bury us?

56:38.695 --> 56:40.895
I never said shit to anyone.
I didn't say a fuckin' word!

56:40.897 --> 56:44.132
You're forgettin' we had
a fuckin' cozzer on the inside

56:44.134 --> 56:46.035
keepin' fuckin' tabs on ya.

56:46.037 --> 56:49.105
Do you know what,
you dumb fuck?

56:49.107 --> 56:51.673
Evans played you
for a fuckin' fool!

56:51.675 --> 56:55.076
Told you a buncha lies,
because he knew that you were

56:55.078 --> 56:56.578
gullible enough to fall for it!

56:56.580 --> 56:58.780
Your trusted a bent copper

56:58.782 --> 57:00.850
over your own flesh and blood!

57:00.852 --> 57:03.351
I never said a fuckin' word.
Not a syllable!

57:03.353 --> 57:06.921
You're fuckin' standin' there, and you expect
me to believe that Evans made all this up?

57:06.923 --> 57:10.625
Yes, he made it all up!
O'Hara told me the truth!

57:10.627 --> 57:13.763
Do you know, when he found out about
Evans, he had him thrown off the force!

57:13.765 --> 57:16.831
Why don't we just give fuckin'
Evans a bell, get him down here, eh?

57:16.833 --> 57:20.935
Let's fuckin' get him down here, and let's
just see what he has to say about all this.

57:20.937 --> 57:23.808
Gimme my phone.

57:25.843 --> 57:29.146
I don't think he's gonna
be answering that phone, mate.

57:39.790 --> 57:43.693
- You all done, boyo?
- Yeah, just finishing the sound check.

58:29.340 --> 58:33.708
- Do I know you, boyo?
- We've met.

58:33.710 --> 58:35.980
You was a sergeant back then.

58:37.915 --> 58:40.949
What happened?
You lose your job?

58:40.951 --> 58:43.221
Cain?

58:44.789 --> 58:46.188
Fuck me.

58:46.190 --> 58:48.960
Is that you, Cain?

58:51.061 --> 58:53.063
It's been a while.

58:55.066 --> 58:57.933
Johnny. Give us a minute,
will you, boyo?

58:57.935 --> 58:59.737
Yeah, all right.

59:05.977 --> 59:09.011
So then, Cain. What?

59:09.013 --> 59:13.015
I'm guessing you, uh,
broke outta prison?

59:13.017 --> 59:16.118
You tracked me down
to this location,

59:16.120 --> 59:20.923
to act your revenge
on the copper who booked you?

59:20.925 --> 59:24.427
You didn't book me.
You set me up.

59:24.429 --> 59:29.331
Told my brother I was gonna
snitch on him, didn't ya?

59:29.333 --> 59:32.168
"Hero Ex-Copper

59:32.170 --> 59:37.239
Kills Escaped Convict
in Self-Defense."

59:37.241 --> 59:40.276
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:08.103
Yeah, I did tell your brother you
snitched on him, you fuckin' cocksucker.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:10.540
I'm gonna make you
fuckin' pay, boy.

01:01:03.094 --> 01:01:09.164
Well, it looks like we got a little
bit of a predicament, haven't we?

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:13.470
Seems you been runnin' around all fuckin'
weekend on your own little revenge mission.

01:01:13.472 --> 01:01:15.604
You're not
thinkin' straight, Cain.

01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:17.439
Because I know
I'm havin' difficulty

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:19.108
takin' in everything
that's happened this week.

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.378
Been a tough week for you,
has it, yeah?

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:27.616
- Poor you.
- I'm talkin' about Mum.

01:01:27.618 --> 01:01:31.322
- Did you get to see her?
- Yeah, I saw her.

01:01:32.457 --> 01:01:35.024
Lyin' under a white sheet.

01:01:37.963 --> 01:01:41.964
You know, if I got there
20 minutes earlier,

01:01:41.966 --> 01:01:44.567
mighta been able
to look her in the eye,

01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:49.807
hold her hand,
tell her I loved her.

01:01:53.411 --> 01:01:54.579
You know what them cops did?

01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:58.550
Stopped off on the way
for a vanilla latte.

01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:03.085
And where the fuck were you?

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:05.254
Listen to me, I had stuff, I had
shit that I needed to deal with.

01:02:05.256 --> 01:02:06.889
Oh, you had shit
to deal with, did ya?

01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:08.491
More important
than our dyin' mother?

01:02:08.493 --> 01:02:10.993
Don't fucking guilt-trip me
on that one, please!

01:02:10.995 --> 01:02:13.363
- Abandoned her, didn't ya?
- The fuck I did.

01:02:13.365 --> 01:02:15.597
Who do you think paid
for all the doctors, huh?

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:18.400
Who do you think
organized every day for her

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.405
to be picked up
and taken to fuckin' hospital?

01:02:22.174 --> 01:02:24.674
Have you got any idea how much it broke her
heart to come and see you in fuckin' prison?

01:02:24.676 --> 01:02:29.044
Because of you!
I was inside because of you!

01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:31.246
You was the one who went
and got fuckin' nicked.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:35.118
You knew the risks.
No one made you do it.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.521
You let me in,
and you threw me under the bus.

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:42.925
No. No, no, no, no.

01:02:42.927 --> 01:02:47.099
It was Mrs. Liddell who got
dragged under the fuckin' bus.

01:02:49.234 --> 01:02:50.234
By you.

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:58.208
Listen to me. I know that life
hasn't been great for you.

01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:00.310
And I know that I've
not helped over the years.

01:03:00.312 --> 01:03:03.112
But you can put a stop
to all this.

01:03:03.114 --> 01:03:05.214
You can fuckin'
stop it right now.

01:03:05.216 --> 01:03:08.553
There's no one left, mate.
Mum's gone.

01:03:10.222 --> 01:03:13.056
You can make a fresh start.
You're a free man now.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:18.227
What about the others?

01:03:18.229 --> 01:03:19.231
What others?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.435
Albert Mitchell,
Pete Singlehurst,

01:03:25.437 --> 01:03:27.469
James Webb, Eric Godley,

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:30.239
Miriam Silverman,
Mabel Liddell,

01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:33.710
and all the other lives
you've been ruinin' for years.

01:03:33.712 --> 01:03:37.080
This retard's gone
and remembered all the names.

01:03:37.082 --> 01:03:38.347
Look, I'll be
honest with you, mate.

01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:40.650
To me they were just another

01:03:40.652 --> 01:03:43.219
fuckin' day at the office.
They mean nothin' to me. They were cunts.

01:03:43.221 --> 01:03:48.191
It's a list of losers
tryin' to shirk off their debts.

01:03:48.193 --> 01:03:53.530
Debts run up by smackheads and
pill-heads and all sorts of other scum.

01:03:53.532 --> 01:03:56.499
We worked out a way of making
quite a lot of money

01:03:56.501 --> 01:03:59.035
outta people that
wouldn't be in that position

01:03:59.037 --> 01:04:02.038
if they'd kept their
fuckin' head on straight.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.306
So you can take
your sentimental bullshit,

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:07.245
and you can shove it
up your fucking...

01:04:21.092 --> 01:04:23.495
You fuckin' want it too?!

01:04:27.632 --> 01:04:29.166
Do you know something?

01:04:30.569 --> 01:04:32.571
I woulda given you the fuckin'
benefit of the doubt on Rook and Chas.

01:04:34.506 --> 01:04:36.807
But what you just done,
you cunt,

01:04:36.809 --> 01:04:39.511
what you just fuckin' done...

01:04:42.147 --> 01:04:43.780
I'm seriously gonna
fuck you up

01:04:43.782 --> 01:04:44.983
like you can't believe.

01:04:45.952 --> 01:04:48.451
You've really fucked
the duck now, this time.

01:04:48.453 --> 01:04:50.687
There's no
coming back from that!

01:04:50.689 --> 01:04:54.125
Maybe I don't wanna come back.

01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:05.802
- You recognize this?
- Should I?

01:05:05.804 --> 01:05:08.738
Your accountant's gonna miss it.

01:05:32.765 --> 01:05:34.364
Can I help you, mate?

01:05:34.366 --> 01:05:36.467
You got a nice place here,
Stokes.

01:05:36.469 --> 01:05:40.570
- Done well for yourself.
- Do I know you?

01:05:40.572 --> 01:05:43.208
Oh, come on. You don't
remember an old friend?

01:05:45.377 --> 01:05:47.845
Fuck me. Cain.

01:05:47.847 --> 01:05:49.446
What happened to ya?

01:05:49.448 --> 01:05:51.514
Oh, shit me,
that toast smells nice.

01:05:51.516 --> 01:05:54.753
Do you mind
if I whack a 'round in? Eh?

01:05:56.756 --> 01:05:58.589
You have at least another
decade on your ticket,

01:05:58.591 --> 01:06:02.825
so I'm guessin' you're
not out on good behavior.

01:06:02.827 --> 01:06:05.762
Well, you got a good thing
goin' on here, haven't ya, mate?

01:06:05.764 --> 01:06:10.201
You know, the wife, the kids,
little pet bunny.

01:06:13.306 --> 01:06:15.538
Are they aware of what you do?

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.477
How you ruin people's lives
for my brother?

01:06:27.919 --> 01:06:31.187
I didn't take you
for the violent type, Stokes.

01:06:31.189 --> 01:06:33.224
Sit down.

01:06:38.196 --> 01:06:42.565
- What do you want?
- I wanna see them books.

01:06:42.567 --> 01:06:44.868
I can't let you, Cain.

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:48.806
Take it you're aware my brother tried
to have me killed on the inside?

01:06:48.808 --> 01:06:51.876
Cain, you know
I've never been a part of that.

01:06:58.384 --> 01:07:00.951
I believe ya.

01:07:00.953 --> 01:07:03.519
I wanna take Lincoln down,
Stokes.

01:07:03.521 --> 01:07:05.388
So you may as well
just show me them books.

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:07.357
And then you go
and get your family,

01:07:07.359 --> 01:07:10.326
you get your shit together,
and you get the fuck gone.

01:07:10.328 --> 01:07:15.300
If I just leave town, you
promise you'll leave us alone?

01:07:16.768 --> 01:07:18.236
Give you my word.

01:07:24.276 --> 01:07:26.576
How much has he got
in his accounts then?

01:07:26.578 --> 01:07:27.945
Three hundred thousand
in his checking,

01:07:27.947 --> 01:07:29.545
with several offshore deposits,

01:07:29.547 --> 01:07:31.615
totaling out to about
two million pounds

01:07:31.617 --> 01:07:34.217
- across a few currencies.
- Tell you what.

01:07:34.219 --> 01:07:37.922
Leave him a grand and a half.
Gonna move the rest.

01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:40.891
Where?

01:07:40.893 --> 01:07:45.296
Ah, well,
uh, that's the fun part.

01:07:46.932 --> 01:07:49.500
Stokes was
a crooked fucker.

01:07:49.502 --> 01:07:51.701
Couldn't lie straight in bed.

01:07:51.703 --> 01:07:53.403
But it didn't take him long
to make his mind up

01:07:53.405 --> 01:07:55.371
- and save his own ass.
- That's bollocks.

01:07:55.373 --> 01:07:59.812
- You're fuckin' lyin'.
- You reckon?

01:08:03.481 --> 01:08:06.650
I took a picture
of your account. See that?

01:08:08.487 --> 01:08:12.523
Two-point-two million
in dollars, euros, pounds.

01:08:12.525 --> 01:08:14.557
All of it gone.

01:08:14.559 --> 01:08:16.426
I left you with
a grand and a half.

01:08:16.428 --> 01:08:18.796
'Cause that's what a few
porcelain teeth woulda cost.

01:08:18.798 --> 01:08:21.799
You're never gonna see the rest.

01:08:21.801 --> 01:08:24.868
You sure are rackin' up the reasons
to get yourself killed tonight,

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:26.837
aren't you, my love?

01:08:26.839 --> 01:08:29.807
I hope your little
revenge mission was worth it.

01:08:29.809 --> 01:08:34.411
You hear that, did ya, Lincoln?
Key words there, revenge.

01:08:34.412 --> 01:08:38.281
Everything I've done over the last
two days, it started with you.

01:08:38.283 --> 01:08:42.553
And for what you did to those innocent
families, it's gonna end with you.

01:08:42.555 --> 01:08:47.524
When you die, the ledger'll
be erased, the debts dissolved.

01:08:47.526 --> 01:08:52.763
And each and every one of those
147 families are gonna be free.

01:08:52.765 --> 01:08:57.501
Those names... you see,
I couldn't help but memorize 'em.

01:08:57.502 --> 01:09:01.072
Repeated,
time and time again in court,

01:09:01.073 --> 01:09:05.542
over and over
I heard those names.

01:09:05.544 --> 01:09:07.845
See, I knew it was
too late to help myself,

01:09:07.846 --> 01:09:12.316
but maybe...
maybe I could help them.

01:09:12.318 --> 01:09:15.018
And maybe, one day,
I might get the chance

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.353
to be face-to-face
with my brother.

01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:19.622
One last time.

01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:21.925
And when I found that purpose,

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:26.362
well, only then could I bear
all the pain and suffering.

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:27.997
Because now it all had meaning.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.403
Now, it all made sense.

01:09:43.482 --> 01:09:47.852
Look... I know

01:09:47.854 --> 01:09:51.420
it's your brother
that's out to get you.

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:56.760
So, I ask you,
why are you protecting him?

01:09:56.762 --> 01:10:00.364
Roll over on him, Cain.
What are you waitin' for?

01:10:00.366 --> 01:10:03.401
They're gonna kill you in here.
You know that, right?

01:10:06.772 --> 01:10:09.140
Good luck, son.

01:10:09.142 --> 01:10:11.343
I'll do it.

01:10:12.846 --> 01:10:14.878
I'll do it on one condition.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.584
My mum's in hospital.

01:10:19.985 --> 01:10:21.955
She don't have long left.

01:10:28.928 --> 01:10:30.894
I want to see my mum.

01:10:30.896 --> 01:10:35.534
You let me see her,
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

01:10:59.759 --> 01:11:02.659
Christ, this ale
tastes like shit, Bez.

01:11:02.661 --> 01:11:06.099
That's because I poured the
drip tray into yours, darling.

01:11:08.902 --> 01:11:12.469
It's about time we got on
with it then. Isn't it, eh?

01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:15.172
Guess you got a pretty good idea
where this is going, Lincoln?

01:11:15.174 --> 01:11:18.944
- Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.
- Yeah, good.

01:11:20.213 --> 01:11:22.046
They can all leave if they want.

01:11:22.048 --> 01:11:24.949
It's only really you
that isn't going anywhere.

01:11:24.951 --> 01:11:28.518
What do you say, lads?
You wanna get out of here?

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:31.057
Enough of this fuckin' bullshit!

01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:34.558
We ain't fuckin' goin' anywhere!

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.895
I dunno, um... I'd quite
like to leave, actually.

01:11:37.897 --> 01:11:40.597
- If it's all right with you lot.
- Shut the fuck up, Tune.

01:11:40.599 --> 01:11:42.566
Yeah, cool.
Sorry, Lincoln.

01:11:42.568 --> 01:11:43.870
No one's going anywhere.

01:11:46.505 --> 01:11:50.207
You're gonna die
in here tonight, Cain.

01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:52.976
You got two barrels.
There's ten of us.

01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:56.580
I only need one to blow your fuckin' head apart.

01:11:56.582 --> 01:11:59.250
Yeah, well, maybe.
And once you use that shot,

01:11:59.252 --> 01:12:05.156
my men are gonna take turns each
tearing you limb from fucking limb.

01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:08.159
And what have you actually
accomplished here tonight?

01:12:08.161 --> 01:12:10.228
Look at ya.

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:12.497
I'll tell ya, shall I?

01:12:12.499 --> 01:12:14.031
Fuck all.

01:12:14.033 --> 01:12:17.701
Absolutely fuck all.
You're a mess.

01:12:17.703 --> 01:12:20.905
And the only thing you're
ever gonna be remembered for

01:12:20.907 --> 01:12:24.110
is being a fuckin' mess.

01:12:26.246 --> 01:12:29.481
I'm all right not being
remembered for anything.

01:12:31.785 --> 01:12:34.986
So let's get on
with it, shall we?

01:12:34.988 --> 01:12:38.789
You know, there's a
million nerves in the human body.

01:12:38.791 --> 01:12:44.195
And you, as my brother,
my fucking brother,

01:12:44.197 --> 01:12:49.933
you have always, since the
day you were fucking born,

01:12:49.935 --> 01:12:53.940
got on every, single
fucking one of 'em.

01:13:06.552 --> 01:13:08.019
Oi!

01:13:08.021 --> 01:13:10.922
Come on then!
You fucking want some of me?!

01:13:10.924 --> 01:13:14.858
Come on!

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.996
You cunts fuckin' want me?
Come on!

01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:30.977
Kill him!

01:13:41.221 --> 01:13:42.754
Fuck!

01:13:57.904 --> 01:13:59.240
Fuck me!

01:14:11.985 --> 01:14:15.887
Come on then! This is fuckin'
brunch at Belmarsh, this!

01:14:15.889 --> 01:14:19.125
Come on!

01:14:53.326 --> 01:14:56.629
Oi! Drop it!

01:15:03.403 --> 01:15:05.436
Fuck me.

01:15:05.438 --> 01:15:06.873
Fuck!

01:15:22.956 --> 01:15:24.158
Fuck.

01:17:54.241 --> 01:17:56.210
Cheers, guys.

01:17:57.544 --> 01:17:59.980
Mm.

01:18:01.081 --> 01:18:03.916
That's fuckin' good.

01:18:10.024 --> 01:18:11.323
Oh!

01:18:13.627 --> 01:18:16.628
Fuck's sake.

01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:19.965
I've only got
a few of them left.

01:18:19.967 --> 01:18:22.536
Lemme ask you something.

01:18:24.472 --> 01:18:27.872
Was it worth it?

01:18:27.874 --> 01:18:34.014
I mean, all this for the sake
of 150 pathetic, fuckin' losers?

01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:37.115
Is this what you wanted?

01:18:37.117 --> 01:18:39.453
Not all I wanted, no.

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:46.659
You're done.
It's over for you.

01:18:46.661 --> 01:18:48.894
I've cost you everything.

01:18:48.896 --> 01:18:53.198
All this, everything you've
worked for, is finished.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.900
You're fucked, mate.

01:18:54.902 --> 01:18:57.102
Is that right?

01:18:57.104 --> 01:18:59.639
That's right, yeah. Yeah.

01:18:59.641 --> 01:19:02.106
Well,
let me tell you something.

01:19:02.108 --> 01:19:05.143
Whatever satisfaction you think
you're gonna get out of all of this

01:19:05.145 --> 01:19:09.147
is gonna be very
fuckin' short-lived.

01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:11.049
Because I always come through.

01:19:11.051 --> 01:19:14.087
You know that, bruv.

01:19:22.697 --> 01:19:25.432
Answer me one thing first.

01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:31.370
Why'd you do it, Lincoln?

01:19:31.372 --> 01:19:34.108
'Cause of you.

01:19:35.175 --> 01:19:37.244
Because of you.

01:19:39.079 --> 01:19:42.247
See, whether you
fucking grassed or not,

01:19:42.249 --> 01:19:44.049
people stopped respecting me.

01:19:44.051 --> 01:19:47.252
And you know me, bruv.

01:19:47.254 --> 01:19:50.255
I will not
be fucking disrespected.

01:19:50.257 --> 01:19:53.225
So, between me and you,

01:19:53.227 --> 01:19:56.428
what's done is done.

01:19:59.634 --> 01:20:04.035
You see, that's what happens when you
get other people to do your dirty work.

01:20:04.037 --> 01:20:06.538
You forget to check the gun
to see if it's loaded.

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:11.176
Two shots, two barrels, and I've
already used both of 'em, you dumb fuck!

01:20:11.178 --> 01:20:14.081
Fucking kill him!

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.276
I think I'll call it
a night then, Bez.

01:21:18.412 --> 01:21:20.715
Sorry about the mess.

01:22:04.124 --> 01:22:06.224
Bring out
the crookedest bank accounts.

01:22:06.226 --> 01:22:09.695
Ah, maybe 147
crooked bank accounts.

01:22:09.697 --> 01:22:13.833
Divide my brother's
fortune by 147.

01:22:13.835 --> 01:22:16.268
And transfer the money
to their accounts.

01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:18.404
You're givin' it away.
Are you mad?

01:22:18.406 --> 01:22:21.207
No, I'm not mad, mate.

01:22:21.209 --> 01:22:25.145
I'm thinking clearer
than I have done in years.

01:22:26.179 --> 01:22:27.813
It's not much.

01:22:27.815 --> 01:22:31.484
Only about 15 grand each.

01:22:31.486 --> 01:22:33.586
But that's a lot of money
to some people.

01:22:33.588 --> 01:22:35.588
Just here for my gyro,
Mr. Patel.

01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:40.292
- Yeah?
- Enough for a fresh start, anyway.

01:22:40.294 --> 01:22:45.700
Or maybe... maybe
just enough to breathe again.

01:22:48.436 --> 01:22:51.303
Just heard from
Albert Mitchell's nephew.

01:22:51.305 --> 01:22:53.639
Another cuckoo got a windfall.

01:22:53.641 --> 01:22:56.542
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:22:56.544 --> 01:22:58.144
That'd be the 12th one
today, actually.

01:22:58.146 --> 01:22:59.545
Right there, Victor, please.

01:22:59.547 --> 01:23:02.147
That is great.

01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:05.653
Yeah, no, no,
thank you, right.

01:27:01.689 --> 01:27:04.490
You're lucky this
didn't go to the Crown Court.

01:27:04.492 --> 01:27:06.392
But as no one
apparently saw anything,

01:27:06.394 --> 01:27:08.595
and the cameras were obscured,

01:27:08.597 --> 01:27:10.664
all I have is a dead inmate,

01:27:10.666 --> 01:27:14.000
and you had his blood
on your clothes.

01:27:14.002 --> 01:27:17.503
I was tryin'
to give him first aid.

01:27:17.505 --> 01:27:20.740
He had a shank so far
into the back of his head,

01:27:20.742 --> 01:27:22.442
it was sticking
out of his mouth.

01:27:22.444 --> 01:27:24.080
What exactly were you
trying to do for him?

01:27:28.984 --> 01:27:31.451
Well, I'm adding an additional
year to your sentence

01:27:31.453 --> 01:27:32.986
for being a part
of the altercation.

01:27:32.988 --> 01:27:34.721
That is the maximum punishment

01:27:34.723 --> 01:27:36.190
that I'm authorized to set.

01:27:36.192 --> 01:27:39.027
Likewise,
six months segregation.

01:27:45.067 --> 01:27:46.766
And cut.

01:27:49.439 --> 01:27:54.439
