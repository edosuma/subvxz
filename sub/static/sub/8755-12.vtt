00:10.487 --> 00:13.487
There's all kinds of
[bleep] going on out here.

00:13.489 --> 00:16.788
I'm terrified to be in my own home.

00:16.790 --> 00:20.225
There is a man with a
double-barreled shotgun,

00:20.227 --> 00:21.593
lots of violence.

00:21.595 --> 00:23.227
Why were you
willing to talk to me?

00:23.229 --> 00:24.663
You were a suspect.

00:24.665 --> 00:27.198
I think she was murdered.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.800
This property was soaked with blood.

00:30.802 --> 00:33.270
I just hear death.

00:33.272 --> 00:36.071
Yeah. We're not supposed to be here.

00:36.073 --> 00:38.406
There's a dark presence.

00:38.408 --> 00:40.314
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.414 --> 00:42.745
These things, they're freaking out.

00:42.747 --> 00:43.913
They're from hell.

00:43.915 --> 00:44.915
I see dead people.

00:44.917 --> 00:46.315
They were being hunted.

00:46.317 --> 00:47.916
I speak to dead people.

00:47.918 --> 00:51.017
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

00:51.019 --> 00:52.220
And they speak to me.

00:52.222 --> 00:53.754
Her neck got broken.

00:53.756 --> 00:56.790
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:56.792 --> 00:58.757
I hear a gunshot.

00:58.759 --> 00:59.792
I rely on my partner.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.294
I'm Steve di Schiavi.

01:01.296 --> 01:03.544
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:03.644 --> 01:05.044
Something's not right here.

01:05.046 --> 01:08.413
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

01:08.415 --> 01:10.979
- It's not safe here.
- It's my job to reveal them.

01:10.981 --> 01:12.481
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:12.483 --> 01:13.817
They're all buried here.

01:13.819 --> 01:15.319
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.419 --> 01:17.484
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.486 --> 01:20.153
- Until the very end...
- I can't do it no more.

01:20.155 --> 01:22.555
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:22.557 --> 01:23.956
Holy [bleep]. Look at this.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.525
Or time to get out.

01:25.527 --> 01:27.058
It does not have a happy ending.

01:27.060 --> 01:30.229
Something kills people here.

01:43.008 --> 01:45.608
I'm out here in the small
town of Concrete, Washington.

01:45.610 --> 01:48.110
It's about 2 hours north of Seattle.

01:48.112 --> 01:51.045
I got a call from a lady
who sounded hysterical.

01:51.047 --> 01:53.647
She was crying on the phone,
saying whatever's in the house

01:53.649 --> 01:56.717
is destroying her health,
ruining her marriage

01:56.719 --> 01:59.685
and making her feel like
she's losing her mind.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.889
She doesn't know where to turn,
and we're her very last hope.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.328
Before Amy arrives, I clear the area

02:09.330 --> 02:13.163
of anything that could
influence her findings.

02:13.165 --> 02:14.698
This home is filled with family photos,

02:14.700 --> 02:17.934
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

02:17.936 --> 02:21.104
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:31.113 --> 02:34.214
There's definitely
something strange

02:34.216 --> 02:37.683
down the street.

02:37.685 --> 02:40.319
What the [bleep]?

02:40.321 --> 02:44.622
There's, like, a, um,
energy field or something.

02:44.624 --> 02:47.825
I think somebody put this
up, put this barrier up.

02:47.827 --> 02:51.395
I don't know how [bleep]
big this thing is.

02:53.764 --> 02:55.863
You know, there was,
like, a lot of violence,

02:55.865 --> 02:59.233
lots of violence, lots of violence.

02:59.235 --> 03:02.071
There's all kinds of
[bleep] going on out here.

03:08.443 --> 03:10.243
Now, Melissa, when
we spoke on the phone,

03:10.245 --> 03:13.546
you were almost in hysterics.

03:13.548 --> 03:16.047
I'm terrified to be in my own home.

03:16.049 --> 03:19.817
It's like living in a nightmare.

03:19.819 --> 03:22.220
Do me a favor and just
start from the beginning.

03:22.222 --> 03:26.456
- When'd you get here?
- Um, we came in 2006.

03:26.458 --> 03:29.226
My husband was transferred
up here with the military.

03:29.228 --> 03:31.259
- Okay.
- We found the land,

03:31.261 --> 03:33.529
and we had the home built.

03:33.531 --> 03:35.630
- All right. So the house is new.
- Yes.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.198
Okay. Do you know anything
about the history of the land

03:38.200 --> 03:39.632
that the house sits on?

03:39.634 --> 03:41.634
I know there was a woman next door.

03:41.636 --> 03:45.039
I know she had her throat slit.

03:45.041 --> 03:46.512
Wow. So I'll look into that.

03:46.612 --> 03:49.347
That's pretty interesting.
This is a big house.

03:49.349 --> 03:50.680
Who exactly lives here with you?

03:50.682 --> 03:53.250
This is a picture of, uh, my family.

03:53.252 --> 03:56.452
This is my husband,
Brandon, and my son, Taylor.

03:56.454 --> 03:57.887
He's 20.

03:57.889 --> 04:00.987
Up until about 2 months
ago, he lived here.

04:02.334 --> 04:05.200
So what exactly is
happening? What's going on?

04:05.202 --> 04:08.571
Sounds, uh, banging,

04:08.573 --> 04:13.874
shadow figures,
apparitions, being touched.

04:13.876 --> 04:16.677
It's getting worse and worse and worse.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.581
Did you hear that?

04:22.583 --> 04:25.150
No.

04:25.152 --> 04:26.783
It went right by my ear,

04:26.785 --> 04:30.554
like "Shh," telling me to be quiet.

04:30.556 --> 04:31.888
Well, you're not gonna be quiet.

04:31.890 --> 04:33.658
So whatever's here can go to hell.

04:33.660 --> 04:36.259
All right? All right?

04:36.261 --> 04:39.561
I'm here with you now.
Nothing's gonna happen.

04:39.563 --> 04:41.015
Take a deep breath
'cause you're shaking.

04:41.661 --> 04:46.063
Come on, with me. Ready?

04:46.065 --> 04:47.597
- Okay.
- I trust you.

04:47.599 --> 04:51.066
Okay. Good.

04:51.068 --> 04:54.203
Nothing in this house is gonna
stop me from doing my job.

04:54.205 --> 04:56.003
See? You feel like you're going crazy

04:56.005 --> 04:57.472
'cause other people don't hear it.

04:57.474 --> 04:59.972
And then, they go,
"Oh, she's just nuts."

04:59.974 --> 05:02.441
I'm not saying that, am I?

05:02.443 --> 05:03.743
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:03.745 --> 05:05.143
Hmm?

05:05.145 --> 05:08.347
All right.

05:08.349 --> 05:11.049
There's, like, a
lot of people talking.

05:11.051 --> 05:12.650
I heard voices in the dark.

05:12.652 --> 05:14.686
And they're yelling and
screaming about this wave

05:14.688 --> 05:15.919
of illness.

05:15.921 --> 05:17.720
There are so many people.

05:17.722 --> 05:18.955
I don't know who these damn people

05:18.957 --> 05:20.623
are in the [bleep] darkness.

05:20.625 --> 05:25.561
They seem to be in this
area of containment.

05:25.563 --> 05:28.095
I'm wondering if they
hear people around.

05:28.097 --> 05:30.364
You know, if they hear
people around their house,

05:30.366 --> 05:32.801
they've gotta be hearing people talking.

05:32.803 --> 05:34.835
They've gotta be hearing conversations.

05:34.837 --> 05:36.479
It's pretty [bleep] bad.

05:36.579 --> 05:38.644
Too much going on.

05:40.014 --> 05:41.914
You said that you
think whatever's going on here

05:41.916 --> 05:43.082
is affecting the marriage.

05:43.084 --> 05:45.484
We used to be really strong.

05:45.486 --> 05:50.890
It seems whatever force is
here is trying to divide us.

05:50.892 --> 05:56.426
My health, um, is rapidly declining.

05:56.428 --> 05:58.895
I have bad osteoporosis.

05:58.897 --> 06:01.830
I see a specialist for my throat.

06:01.832 --> 06:05.200
They say I have vocal cord dysfunction.

06:05.202 --> 06:08.704
But actually, I feel like I've
been choked by what's ever here.

06:08.706 --> 06:11.839
Did you have any of these
symptoms prior to moving here?

06:11.841 --> 06:14.442
No.

06:14.444 --> 06:16.943
I was healthy.

06:16.945 --> 06:20.346
I think it's trying to kill me.

06:20.348 --> 06:23.049
Okay.

06:25.017 --> 06:27.452
These dead people in
the dark, they're so sick.

06:30.122 --> 06:34.324
The living are feeling some
of these physical symptoms.

06:36.127 --> 06:41.004
Oh, I don't feel good.

06:41.432 --> 06:45.332
Really bad, really bad.

06:45.334 --> 06:46.534
This is fear.

06:46.536 --> 06:47.902
This is fear, like,

06:47.904 --> 06:49.637
uh, you're so afraid. You're so afraid.

06:49.639 --> 06:52.005
You're so afraid that you,
like, you know, you get sick.

06:52.007 --> 06:53.504
You're [bleep] sick.

06:56.076 --> 06:57.843
Terrified. [Bleep] terrified.

06:57.845 --> 06:59.645
Terrified.

07:06.152 --> 07:07.417
Okay. What's going on?

07:07.419 --> 07:10.085
Hearing voices, multiple.

07:10.087 --> 07:11.453
Is it male, female?

07:11.455 --> 07:13.857
Two females arguing, really mad.

07:13.859 --> 07:17.092
What about the TV being
on? Anything like that?

07:17.094 --> 07:18.360
No. Everything was shut off.

07:18.362 --> 07:19.460
All right. So you're hearing voices.

07:19.462 --> 07:20.927
What else is going on?

07:20.929 --> 07:24.585
Had a woman sit on the
bed and try to touch me.

07:26.543 --> 07:28.810
Okay. Can you describe her for me?

07:28.812 --> 07:33.347
She had long hair. It
was like a skeleton face.

07:33.349 --> 07:35.983
Okay. So this is something
that was meant to scare you.

07:35.985 --> 07:39.385
Yeah. She sat down on the bed,

07:39.387 --> 07:42.955
and she reached out for me.

07:42.957 --> 07:45.991
She said, "You're gonna die."

07:45.993 --> 07:48.127
Relax. Just hold my hand. Relax.

07:50.962 --> 07:53.529
I'm hearing a woman outside.

07:53.531 --> 07:54.920
I think she was murdered.

07:57.702 --> 08:01.402
There's a man, uh, with a, uh,

08:01.404 --> 08:03.537
double-barrel shotgun.

08:03.539 --> 08:06.907
And then, there's these two guys.

08:06.909 --> 08:09.030
They're like... They're bullies.

08:09.277 --> 08:13.581
And they don't wanna talk
about the... the lady at all.

08:19.486 --> 08:21.652
I don't know what's going on here.

08:27.992 --> 08:31.293
This dead woman, who crawls all around,

08:31.295 --> 08:35.629
I see her crawling into bed.

08:35.631 --> 08:39.787
She does, uh, wrap herself around,

08:39.967 --> 08:43.703
uh, this living, uh, woman, I believe.

08:43.706 --> 08:46.071
And it's not good for a living person.

08:46.073 --> 08:46.628
Why?

08:46.713 --> 08:51.087
The living person is taking
on that dead person's energy.

08:51.187 --> 08:54.187
So they can start acting
like the dead person.

08:54.189 --> 08:56.856
They'll take on
mannerisms, speech patterns.

08:56.858 --> 09:01.107
And then, that makes the
living person [bleep] sick.

09:01.195 --> 09:02.560
Has anything else happened?

09:02.562 --> 09:06.248
I was taking a bath 2 nights ago.

09:06.733 --> 09:09.900
Got out of the bathtub,
felt burning on my leg.

09:09.902 --> 09:12.769
- Okay.
- I looked down.

09:12.771 --> 09:14.019
And I had scratches.

09:15.651 --> 09:16.616
They were deep.

09:16.618 --> 09:18.150
It hurt.

09:18.152 --> 09:19.784
Wow.

09:19.786 --> 09:21.187
I gotta say, this is probably

09:21.189 --> 09:23.188
one of the more severe
cases we've worked on.

09:23.190 --> 09:26.592
Just make it go away and
make it stop hurting me.

09:26.594 --> 09:28.927
I will. We're gonna take care of it.

09:28.929 --> 09:31.363
- Okay.
- It's okay.

09:34.266 --> 09:36.733
I know.

09:39.936 --> 09:41.203
The two bullies,

09:41.205 --> 09:44.938
I think that they are around

09:44.940 --> 09:49.277
when the chick strays.

09:50.812 --> 09:55.515
They have to get her back
because she belongs to them.

09:55.517 --> 09:58.049
But the living go through something

09:58.051 --> 10:00.184
when they [bleep] retrieve her.

10:00.186 --> 10:01.886
What happens to them?

10:01.888 --> 10:04.722
I think the living person
would feel potentially like,

10:04.724 --> 10:08.892
you know, they're being
grabbed or touched.

10:08.894 --> 10:11.528
They feel the anger.
They feel the pressure.

10:11.530 --> 10:14.498
They feel like all of this
is happening around them.

10:38.752 --> 10:40.116
Okay. So I
understand you're a vet.

10:40.118 --> 10:42.819
I am. I spent, uh, all of 2004

10:42.821 --> 10:44.420
in Fallujah, Iraq, with the Marines.

10:44.422 --> 10:45.454
I was talking to your wife.

10:45.456 --> 10:47.589
And, uh, she got real upset.

10:47.591 --> 10:49.823
She thinks that whatever's
here is trying to kill her.

10:49.825 --> 10:52.528
I can't say it's not.

10:52.530 --> 10:54.295
'Kay. So what about yourself?

10:54.297 --> 10:56.430
- Any experiences in the house?
- Yeah.

10:56.432 --> 10:57.623
Okay. So tell me about them.

10:57.723 --> 10:58.722
I would get this neck pain.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.389
It felt like someone had me,

11:00.391 --> 11:02.591
but with a rope around my neck,
was pulling me up in the air.

11:02.593 --> 11:04.759
I couldn't breathe, and I
could start tasting blood,

11:04.761 --> 11:06.260
undeniable taste of blood.

11:06.262 --> 11:08.563
And I've tasted blood in my
mouth a lot over my lifetime.

11:08.565 --> 11:10.197
How long did it last?

11:10.199 --> 11:12.698
That experience can last
anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.

11:12.700 --> 11:17.002
It's happened multiple
times, Steve, multiple times.

11:17.004 --> 11:18.270
Yeah.

11:18.272 --> 11:20.838
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.006
Uh, I was sitting there, watching TV,

11:23.008 --> 11:25.608
and felt something weird.

11:25.610 --> 11:27.276
Just looked up and
looked out the window.

11:27.278 --> 11:28.946
And when I looked out the window,

11:28.948 --> 11:31.615
at that second pane up on
that window right there,

11:31.617 --> 11:33.982
was a child's face looking in at me.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.483
Now, when you saw the face,

11:35.485 --> 11:36.717
did you think it mighta been
some kid in the neighborhood

11:36.719 --> 11:38.086
and go out and check.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.487
Um, we don't have any neighborhood kids.

11:39.489 --> 11:40.454
You think you're losing your mind.

11:40.554 --> 11:42.553
You do. You think you're
absolutely going crazy.

11:42.555 --> 11:43.721
Okay. I'm afraid to even ask

11:43.723 --> 11:45.322
what other experiences you've had.

11:45.324 --> 11:47.692
- But, uh...
- My wife and son had gone out,

11:47.694 --> 11:48.924
and I was sitting here on the couch.

11:48.926 --> 11:50.460
And everything was fine.

11:50.462 --> 11:56.932
When I looked up, there
was a black...

11:56.934 --> 11:59.900
There was a black shadow
thing standing right here

11:59.902 --> 12:02.602
in front of the TV, clear as
you are right now in front of me.

12:02.604 --> 12:04.538
I looked right at this thing,
and I couldn't see through it.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.740
And it scared me so
bad that I... I gasped,

12:06.742 --> 12:08.207
and I leaned back in the chair,

12:08.209 --> 12:09.408
and I looked down.

12:09.410 --> 12:12.552
When I looked back up, it was gone.

12:13.046 --> 12:15.245
You all right?

12:15.247 --> 12:16.980
Sounds crazy, dunnit?

12:16.982 --> 12:18.615
Your job to protect... How
do you protect something

12:18.617 --> 12:20.721
you can't protect against?

12:24.873 --> 12:28.607
I'm seeing this other guy.

12:28.609 --> 12:29.775
He's a weirdo.

12:29.777 --> 12:31.444
And when I first saw him,

12:31.446 --> 12:37.115
he looked like a shadow crawling
up the wall, onto the ceiling.

12:37.117 --> 12:40.117
And then he shows me his face.

12:40.119 --> 12:41.885
He just says he's the manager.

12:41.887 --> 12:45.521
I oversee the operations.

12:45.523 --> 12:47.256
He likes the ceilings.

12:47.258 --> 12:49.424
He's all about the ceilings.

12:49.426 --> 12:50.592
They could see him as,

12:50.594 --> 12:55.061
like, a translucent male
or if they see, like,

12:55.063 --> 12:59.341
just a little shadow that
moves on the ceilings.

12:59.367 --> 13:01.767
He likes to feel like
he's on top of people.

13:01.769 --> 13:03.603
He's always watching everybody.

13:03.605 --> 13:06.306
He's gotta know everything
at all [bleep] times.

13:12.244 --> 13:14.577
So, Tamee, I understand that
you used to live next door here.

13:14.579 --> 13:16.045
- Yes.
- All right.

13:16.047 --> 13:18.281
Lived 140 yards from here.

13:18.283 --> 13:20.250
Okay. When did you move?

13:20.252 --> 13:22.651
- Two years ago.
- Okay. Why?

13:22.653 --> 13:26.722
I had a lot of experiences in the house

13:26.724 --> 13:28.790
- that I couldn't explain.
- Okay.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.558
Can you tell me some
experiences you had?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.425
Um, one of the things that,

13:32.427 --> 13:37.429
um, really made me
fearful for my life, um,

13:37.431 --> 13:39.130
and my children...

13:39.132 --> 13:41.733
I would get so sick.

13:41.735 --> 13:43.578
So what kind of illnesses
are we talking about?

13:43.678 --> 13:48.445
I would get horrendous
stomach pains often.

13:48.447 --> 13:50.114
- Okay.
- I couldn't stop throwing up.

13:50.116 --> 13:52.450
I hardly could breathe.

13:52.452 --> 13:53.917
And since I've moved,

13:53.919 --> 13:58.155
I have not had any stomach problems.

13:58.157 --> 14:00.089
Listened to Melissa today

14:00.091 --> 14:02.725
and what she had to say
about her health issues.

14:02.727 --> 14:04.426
A lot of it sounds similar
to some of the stuff

14:04.428 --> 14:05.860
she's going through.

14:05.862 --> 14:08.897
Everybody's health is failing
around here, everybody.

14:08.899 --> 14:10.198
Interesting.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.767
Did anything else happen?

14:12.769 --> 14:16.636
It seemed our moods and
attitudes were affected.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.771
We were very, very angry.

14:18.773 --> 14:20.974
And we're not angry people.

14:20.976 --> 14:23.742
Did you ever bring any,
uh, priest or preachers

14:23.744 --> 14:25.911
into the house to bless
it or anything like that?

14:25.913 --> 14:28.612
I did talk to the local tribes.

14:28.614 --> 14:31.832
I was told that this used
to be Native American land

14:32.083 --> 14:33.804
before white people settled here,

14:33.818 --> 14:37.787
that it was soaked with blood and people

14:37.789 --> 14:39.746
shouldn't live on this property.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.743
Well, I don't like it out here.

14:48.745 --> 14:49.944
Hm-mm.

14:49.946 --> 14:53.206
I just hear death.

14:53.283 --> 14:56.283
I think that,

14:56.285 --> 15:00.987
if you come here, you're tainted.

15:01.690 --> 15:04.890
How would being here affect the living?

15:04.892 --> 15:08.798
It would seem like it could
potentially drive people insane.

15:10.162 --> 15:16.101
I don't think it's a good
place for anything alive.

15:16.103 --> 15:18.169
And I'm kind of freaked out.

15:18.171 --> 15:23.140
What I'm getting is that, if
you enter this space, you're...

15:23.142 --> 15:26.042
you're kind of, like, doomed.

15:39.988 --> 15:41.953
Melissa mentioned someone got murdered

15:41.955 --> 15:43.300
on the original property line.

15:43.391 --> 15:46.057
So I made some calls,
and the story checks out.

15:46.059 --> 15:48.526
Only thing is, the cops won't
talk to me about it 'cause

15:48.528 --> 15:49.993
it's still an open case.

15:49.995 --> 15:51.828
So I'm heading over to
meet with a local historian

15:51.830 --> 15:53.262
who's looking through the original case

15:53.264 --> 15:55.899
files for me to tell me
exactly what happened.

16:02.071 --> 16:03.574
What do we know about the victim?

16:03.674 --> 16:06.541
- The victim was Vicki Silves.
- Okay.

16:06.543 --> 16:09.375
Vicki was an accountant
at a local company.

16:09.377 --> 16:10.977
She was actually married to a gentleman

16:10.979 --> 16:12.278
by the name of John Silves.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.749
And here's actually a couple
of their wedding photos.

16:16.751 --> 16:18.417
Do we have any idea
when they got married?

16:18.419 --> 16:20.518
1993.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.393
They moved to Concrete in 1996.

16:22.493 --> 16:25.428
And shortly after
coming to Concrete, uh,

16:25.430 --> 16:28.396
their marriage starts to fall apart.

16:28.398 --> 16:31.464
And then, John ended
up moving back to, uh,

16:31.466 --> 16:33.733
Port Angeles, where
he worked as a trucker.

16:33.735 --> 16:35.512
How's the murder take
place? What happened?

16:35.612 --> 16:39.013
The morning of December 8, 1997,

16:39.015 --> 16:42.383
she had been known to
be very prompt to work,

16:42.385 --> 16:44.549
and she didn't show up.

16:44.551 --> 16:48.153
So the manager for the
company became very concerned

16:48.155 --> 16:52.124
and sent a, uh, coworker
over to check on her,

16:52.126 --> 16:55.793
where he found her dead in
her gravel driveway and...

16:55.795 --> 16:57.895
and then covered her with a blanket.

16:57.897 --> 17:00.196
- Uh, the first attempt...
- Whoa, whoa.

17:00.198 --> 17:02.166
The coworker covered her with a blanket?

17:02.168 --> 17:03.398
- Correct.
- All right.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.133
So he contaminated the
crime scene right away.

17:05.135 --> 17:07.167
He did.

17:07.170 --> 17:10.104
I have her, uh, death certificate here

17:10.106 --> 17:13.840
that describes her cause of
death of acute exsanguination.

17:13.843 --> 17:16.008
So she's stabbed in the
neck. She bleeds out.

17:16.010 --> 17:18.810
Yes. I was able to
get the first 40 pages

17:18.813 --> 17:22.748
of the police report on the murder.

17:22.977 --> 17:26.578
What it described was, there
was no sign of forcible entry.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.912
The door was opened about 6 to 8 inches.

17:28.914 --> 17:30.914
- All right.
- All the lights were on.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.281
The interesting thing was
that she was laying there

17:33.283 --> 17:36.853
with a large pool of blood,
but her shoes were 20 feet away.

17:36.855 --> 17:38.986
All right. So, Eric,
there's a lot of stuff here.

17:38.988 --> 17:41.889
But do you know when the
last time she was seen alive?

17:41.891 --> 17:44.959
Yes. Vicki was seen alive at a party.

17:44.961 --> 17:48.662
There were 4 people that were
at that party besides Vicki.

17:48.664 --> 17:51.898
Uh, two actually would
become important to this case.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.768
We have Ray Valeton and a Richard Brink.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.537
Vicki had gotten fairly drunk,

17:58.539 --> 18:01.638
and Mr. Brink says that
he would take her home.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.274
According to him, when they get there,

18:04.276 --> 18:07.042
they did a little more drinking.

18:07.044 --> 18:10.346
And according to him,
they'd be kissing one minute,

18:10.348 --> 18:12.847
and then she'd be
cursing at him the next.

18:12.849 --> 18:17.218
He apparently got uncomfortable
with this and left the house

18:17.220 --> 18:18.820
about 1:15 in the morning.

18:18.855 --> 18:21.322
He's putting himself at the crime scene.

18:21.324 --> 18:22.789
So what happens next?

18:22.791 --> 18:25.084
So the other guy in
the party, Ray Valeton,

18:25.184 --> 18:28.651
he is the alibi for... for Mr. Brink.

18:28.653 --> 18:30.019
He says he just happens to know

18:30.021 --> 18:32.788
that Mr. Brink came home
at 1:30 in the morning.

18:32.790 --> 18:35.088
All right. That's not much of an alibi.

18:35.090 --> 18:37.692
I would have to say
that you're not mistaken.

18:37.694 --> 18:39.593
Okay. Now, what about the ex-husband?

18:39.595 --> 18:41.060
So the ex-husband,

18:41.062 --> 18:43.387
John, uh, actually did
have a really good alibi.

18:43.487 --> 18:46.656
He had been in Port
Angeles when this happened.

18:46.658 --> 18:49.425
Plus, he took a
polygraph test and passed.

18:49.427 --> 18:51.226
Okay. So was anybody arrested

18:51.228 --> 18:53.528
and brought to the
grand jury on this case?

18:53.530 --> 18:56.664
Nobody was ever
arrested for this murder.

18:56.666 --> 18:59.098
Wow. And this is still
an open case today?

18:59.100 --> 19:01.400
It's an unsolved case today, still open.

19:01.402 --> 19:03.734
As far as I know, there
is nobody working the case.

19:03.736 --> 19:05.170
That's a shame.

19:08.441 --> 19:12.043
Try to get more on the bed lady.

19:12.045 --> 19:15.712
She's so [bleep] confused

19:15.714 --> 19:17.648
about how she died.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.349
Do you have any idea when this was?

19:19.351 --> 19:21.450
It doesn't feel like that long ago.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.486
Even the guys, like,
they don't feel that old.

19:24.488 --> 19:26.654
And she died horribly.

19:26.656 --> 19:31.226
The assault is outside, raining, dark.

19:31.228 --> 19:32.694
She was [bleep] blindsided.

19:32.696 --> 19:34.428
Up until, really, the end,

19:34.430 --> 19:36.662
she was just like, "What the?"

19:36.664 --> 19:38.397
There's pain, mm,

19:38.399 --> 19:42.435
to the left eye, uh, very sharp...

19:44.738 --> 19:47.142
and then to the head and neck area.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.212
I can't breathe. What's happening?

19:49.214 --> 19:52.316
Like, it's like she's
not registering anything.

19:55.886 --> 19:58.119
So I actually managed to track down

19:58.121 --> 19:59.989
the victim's estranged husband.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.623
And I've gotta be honest,
I was surprised that he

20:01.625 --> 20:05.242
was not only willing but excited
to talk to me about the case.

20:05.756 --> 20:07.756
So I'm meeting him
back at the crime scene,

20:07.758 --> 20:10.024
where he wants to tell me what
he thinks happened the night

20:10.026 --> 20:11.526
his wife was murdered.

20:16.431 --> 20:18.397
So, John, thanks for taking
the time to meet with me.

20:18.399 --> 20:20.599
I know this is a pretty touchy subject.

20:20.601 --> 20:23.567
Your wife was murdered right here,

20:23.569 --> 20:26.137
- in this building back here.
- Yes.

20:26.139 --> 20:27.804
Why were you willing to talk to me?

20:27.806 --> 20:29.104
You were a suspect.

20:29.106 --> 20:31.373
This is 18 years ago.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.342
And this is a cold
case. And nobody's on it.

20:33.344 --> 20:34.677
Nobody's doing anything about it.

20:34.679 --> 20:36.411
And maybe somebody knows something.

20:36.413 --> 20:38.947
So let's get on it. Let's
keep this case going.

20:38.949 --> 20:40.547
Okay. Now, what kind of woman was she?

20:40.549 --> 20:42.083
She was really outgoing.

20:42.085 --> 20:44.051
But Vicki had a jealousy issue.

20:44.053 --> 20:47.554
She accused me of
stuff that I never did.

20:47.556 --> 20:49.788
I said, "That's it."
I said, "Baby," I says,

20:49.790 --> 20:52.391
"I'm outta here." I says, "I'm gone."

20:52.393 --> 20:54.125
Okay. She gets murdered.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.694
How do you get notified?

20:55.696 --> 20:57.062
I was in bed.

20:57.064 --> 21:00.564
And, um, there was people
beating on the side of my house.

21:00.566 --> 21:02.217
And I got up, went to
the door and opened it,

21:02.317 --> 21:04.851
and here's a guy standing there with

21:04.853 --> 21:08.053
a Skagit County Sheriff's
Department jacket on.

21:08.055 --> 21:09.654
Before the night was over,

21:09.656 --> 21:14.359
he had told me how much easier
it would be if I just confessed.

21:14.361 --> 21:18.428
I said, "Confess to something I
never had anything to do with?"

21:18.430 --> 21:21.463
So, John, exactly what was your alibi?

21:21.465 --> 21:25.334
They found a receipt showing
that I was 150 miles away

21:25.336 --> 21:26.669
the night of the murder.

21:26.671 --> 21:27.968
Okay.

21:27.970 --> 21:29.904
So, John, you mentioned on
the phone that you had a theory

21:29.906 --> 21:32.039
about what might have
happened to your wife.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.774
- Yeah, I do.
- 'Kay. What was it?

21:33.776 --> 21:37.177
Well, I got this letter.
It was an anonymous letter.

21:37.179 --> 21:41.780
The person who wrote it kind of
explains what... what happened.

21:41.782 --> 21:43.782
- Vicki was an accountant.
- Okay.

21:43.784 --> 21:47.284
And she evidently uncovered
a stealing operation

21:47.286 --> 21:48.585
that had been going on for years.

21:48.587 --> 21:50.554
And it involved a lot of money.

21:50.556 --> 21:52.088
I believe she told the wrong person,

21:52.090 --> 21:53.555
- and they took her out.
- All right.

21:53.557 --> 21:55.158
This is pretty far-fetched stuff here.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.259
But you think this mighta had
something to do with her murder?

21:57.261 --> 21:59.128
I think so, yeah.

22:02.531 --> 22:07.668
The two guys are all
in black, all in shadow.

22:07.670 --> 22:10.403
The other guy, like, with
the shotgun, you know,

22:10.405 --> 22:12.670
he's got, like, some hat on.

22:12.672 --> 22:15.074
He's got, like, a long jacket on.

22:15.076 --> 22:19.243
You know, he strikes me
as the type of guy who,

22:19.245 --> 22:24.081
in life, obviously
held a power position,

22:24.083 --> 22:26.016
somewhere like a con artist.

22:26.018 --> 22:27.383
Do you know if these two guys

22:27.385 --> 22:30.286
had anything to do
with killing the girl?

22:30.288 --> 22:34.455
I am going to say she
knew these men, uh,

22:34.457 --> 22:35.859
and was possibly friends with them.

22:35.959 --> 22:38.058
So they have some sort of
relationship with the guy

22:38.060 --> 22:39.626
that actually killed her?

22:39.628 --> 22:42.132
Yes.

22:42.898 --> 22:44.262
This poor chick,

22:44.264 --> 22:47.833
whatever happened was
completely unexpected.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.540
If you need us to investigate

22:55.542 --> 22:57.407
unexplained activity in your home,

22:57.409 --> 23:00.075
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

23:00.077 --> 23:01.544
Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files" to submit your story,

23:01.546 --> 23:03.014
and we'll help if we can.

23:11.421 --> 23:13.586
So far, I've got
a couple living in fear

23:13.588 --> 23:16.156
on a property connected
to an unsolved murder.

23:16.158 --> 23:17.590
But I need to see if there's

23:17.592 --> 23:20.159
anything else that could
help my investigation.

23:21.328 --> 23:22.726
Searching through old records,

23:22.728 --> 23:25.197
I find dozens of people
who died of illnesses

23:25.199 --> 23:27.165
on my clients' land.

23:27.167 --> 23:29.300
But what really catches
my attention is the murder

23:29.302 --> 23:30.668
of a Native American

23:30.670 --> 23:32.818
less than 300 feet
from Melissa's property.

23:34.307 --> 23:36.272
I called my old friend,
author Jeff Davis,

23:36.274 --> 23:37.606
to look into it for me.

23:37.608 --> 23:40.143
He says this murder was pretty brutal,

23:40.145 --> 23:42.545
and it remains unsolved to this day.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.049
So, Jeff, before we get to the murder,

23:49.051 --> 23:51.618
who were the Native Americans
that inhabited this area?

23:51.620 --> 23:54.319
Those people were the
Upper Skagit Indian tribe.

23:54.321 --> 23:56.355
And I've got a photo of some.

23:56.357 --> 23:59.692
Now, this was taken, uh,
probably in the early 1900s.

23:59.694 --> 24:01.259
So obviously, the Native Americans

24:01.261 --> 24:03.094
were displaced by the white
settlers at some point.

24:03.096 --> 24:04.429
How did they do that?

24:04.431 --> 24:06.297
There were a whole series of battles

24:06.299 --> 24:08.699
throughout the Northwest from 1855.

24:08.701 --> 24:10.200
All the way up to the 1900s,

24:10.202 --> 24:11.968
- there were still tensions.
- Okay.

24:11.970 --> 24:14.154
So at some point, obviously,
they were wiped out.

24:14.254 --> 24:15.441
Exactly.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.989
There is Native Americans here.

24:19.991 --> 24:21.824
Boy, they don't wanna have anything

24:21.826 --> 24:23.493
to do with this place.

24:26.965 --> 24:33.399
Like, they're... It's, like,
repulsed, repulsed, very angry.

24:33.401 --> 24:35.401
Anger is a understatement.

24:35.403 --> 24:36.678
There's a lot of them.

24:38.405 --> 24:42.174
But I think Native Americans
here put this barrier up.

24:42.176 --> 24:46.712
What I'm getting from them is
that this is contaminated land,

24:46.947 --> 24:52.117
and that no living
organism should exist here.

24:55.528 --> 24:55.881
All right.

24:55.981 --> 24:58.574
So tensions were high up into
the beginning of the 1900s.

24:58.674 --> 25:01.374
Now, I know the homicide
happened in 1905.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.041
Now, what do you know
about the homicide itself?

25:03.043 --> 25:06.311
One of the Native Americans...
his name was Wapato Joe...

25:06.313 --> 25:08.046
- went missing.
- Okay.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.415
At this time, he was about 75 years old.

25:10.417 --> 25:12.281
And he seemed to be liked by everybody.

25:12.283 --> 25:14.150
About 2 weeks passed,

25:14.152 --> 25:16.752
and then they finally
found his body, uh,

25:16.754 --> 25:18.598
on the bank of the river.

25:18.623 --> 25:20.189
How far from my
clients' property was it?

25:20.191 --> 25:22.891
Uh, it was about 300
feet from the property.

25:22.893 --> 25:24.794
How was he murdered? 'Cause
the article's kind of vague.

25:24.796 --> 25:27.062
He had been shot through the throat.

25:27.064 --> 25:28.595
It was at close range

25:28.597 --> 25:30.230
because there were powder burns...

25:30.232 --> 25:31.231
- Okay.
- Around that.

25:31.233 --> 25:32.966
And the... the weirdest thing

25:32.968 --> 25:35.236
was that somebody had cut off his hands.

25:35.238 --> 25:37.102
That's a real cold-blooded
killing for a...

25:37.104 --> 25:41.039
to a 75-year-old guy that...
You know, not bothering anybody.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.740
Did they ever make an
arrest on this case?

25:42.742 --> 25:44.441
No. No, nobody was ever arrested.

25:44.443 --> 25:46.111
And from what I can tell,

25:46.113 --> 25:49.614
they didn't seem to look very
hard for... for the killer.

25:51.883 --> 25:56.419
This barrier, it promotes
violence and violent acts.

25:56.421 --> 26:01.989
It seems to trap, uh, people
who died on this land here.

26:01.991 --> 26:05.359
And I don't know if it
pulls people back here

26:05.361 --> 26:07.192
who have died elsewhere.

26:07.194 --> 26:08.629
The Native Americans,

26:08.631 --> 26:10.763
they would throw crazy people in there.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.638
And then they, like, go mad.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.406
And they're, like, screaming
and yelling and hollering.

26:18.408 --> 26:21.677
And they're, like,
jumping around all crazy.

26:21.679 --> 26:24.506
And they're just acting like animals.

26:30.020 --> 26:32.318
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

26:32.320 --> 26:35.188
but the murdered woman
stood out the most.

26:35.190 --> 26:38.590
She was probably about my height.

26:38.592 --> 26:42.727
- She had very thin brows.
- Mm-hmm.

26:42.729 --> 26:44.828
It was raining or had
been raining 'cause

26:44.830 --> 26:47.765
she was completely wet.

26:47.767 --> 26:51.167
Then, I described her wrapping
herself around a living woman

26:51.169 --> 26:52.567
in the house.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.604
The dead lady is really thin.

26:55.606 --> 26:59.240
She is naked. And she's gray.

26:59.242 --> 27:00.741
She's covered in mud.

27:00.743 --> 27:03.520
She is kind of

27:03.620 --> 27:08.022
coming up behind the living woman

27:08.024 --> 27:11.523
and embracing her.

27:12.193 --> 27:14.880
Is this what you saw?

27:15.197 --> 27:17.149
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.514
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:39.516 --> 27:40.948
we're ready to reveal our findings

27:40.950 --> 27:44.217
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

27:44.219 --> 27:45.819
When I sat down with Melissa here,

27:45.821 --> 27:47.253
the first words out of her mouth

27:47.255 --> 27:50.357
were, "I'm terrified
to be in my own home."

27:50.359 --> 27:52.724
She believes that whatever's
here is destroying her marriage,

27:52.726 --> 27:56.394
her health, and she
thinks she's going insane.

27:56.396 --> 27:57.762
This is her husband, Brandon.

27:57.764 --> 28:00.098
Uh, he served with the Navy,

28:00.100 --> 28:02.733
and he was with the
Marine Corps in Iraq.

28:02.735 --> 28:04.568
He's been to hell and back, basically,

28:04.570 --> 28:07.771
but never expected to come home
to a war zone in his own house.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.871
They can't afford to leave,

28:09.873 --> 28:13.308
but they're not sure
they'll survive if they stay.

28:13.310 --> 28:16.043
So now that Amy knows who
you guys are, a little bit

28:16.045 --> 28:18.125
about what's going on, she's
gonna describe her walk for us.

28:20.116 --> 28:24.283
When I first approached the property,

28:24.285 --> 28:29.788
I realized your house seems
to be located inside some kind

28:29.790 --> 28:32.625
of energy barrier.

28:32.959 --> 28:38.327
It seemed very negative
and very, very powerful.

28:38.329 --> 28:42.632
There's a lot of dead
that are just on the land,

28:42.634 --> 28:43.833
who are trapped.

28:43.835 --> 28:46.668
And I was thinking that
it would be possible

28:46.670 --> 28:51.839
that you guys would hear
them talking or hear voices.

28:51.841 --> 28:54.374
I felt nauseous and this illness.

28:54.376 --> 28:55.743
And the people

28:55.745 --> 28:59.145
were saying that a lot of
them had died from this.

29:00.914 --> 29:02.280
What I kept hearing out there

29:02.282 --> 29:05.258
was that we were not
supposed to be here.

29:06.252 --> 29:08.251
We've heard children.

29:08.253 --> 29:10.629
Uh, I've heard a man, heard women.

29:11.380 --> 29:13.079
I was sitting
on the couch, looked up,

29:13.081 --> 29:15.015
and I saw what looked
like a child's face.

29:15.017 --> 29:16.950
It almost looked like
a hologram projection,

29:16.952 --> 29:20.586
a blue and white face looking
in the... in the glass.

29:20.588 --> 29:22.854
- Okay.
- You mentioned sicknesses, right?

29:22.856 --> 29:24.456
- Oh, yeah.
- One of the main reasons

29:24.458 --> 29:27.426
we're here is because her
health has deteriorated.

29:27.493 --> 29:30.027
A couple months ago,
I had an iron infusion.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.696
My blood won't produce iron.

29:32.698 --> 29:36.966
Vocal cord dysfunction,
now, all of a sudden, nausea,

29:36.968 --> 29:38.435
vomiting.

29:38.437 --> 29:40.602
I was pretty healthy
before we moved here.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.071
Wow.

29:42.073 --> 29:44.706
Now, the barrier thing, do
you know who put this thing up?

29:44.708 --> 29:47.208
Native Americans put up the barrier.

29:47.210 --> 29:51.745
And the reason why was, over
a very long period of time,

29:51.747 --> 29:52.979
they noticed a pattern.

29:52.981 --> 29:56.547
Some of the men from the
tribe would come out here.

29:56.549 --> 30:00.419
And after exposure to this area,

30:00.421 --> 30:02.170
they would basically go insane.

30:03.723 --> 30:08.024
So they decided the best thing to do

30:08.026 --> 30:10.893
was to block off this land

30:10.895 --> 30:15.464
because they felt like it causes
mental illness, violent acts.

30:15.466 --> 30:18.933
And what really freaked me
out was, any living person

30:18.935 --> 30:21.934
who steps onto this land is tainted.

30:22.037 --> 30:27.106
And what they were kind
of saying was, "Doomed."

30:27.108 --> 30:29.111
Yeah, I feel like I'm going crazy.

30:29.211 --> 30:31.344
I spoke to one of Melissa's neighbors.

30:31.346 --> 30:33.112
They used to live here.
Her name was Tamee.

30:33.114 --> 30:35.181
Her and her husband fought a lot here,

30:35.183 --> 30:37.015
and she had mysterious stomach pains

30:37.017 --> 30:39.450
that she couldn't figure out.

30:39.452 --> 30:40.918
She moved away 2 years ago.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.752
When she moved, she was fine.

30:42.754 --> 30:45.221
Interesting. Interesting.

30:45.223 --> 30:46.922
Now, when Tamee was living here,

30:46.924 --> 30:51.159
she said she went to a local
Native American tribe for help.

30:51.161 --> 30:53.527
And they told her, "Too
much bloodshed on the land.

30:53.529 --> 30:55.029
We can't help you."

30:55.031 --> 30:56.764
Really?

30:56.766 --> 30:58.865
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:58.867 --> 31:00.367
Now, let me tell you
a little bit of history

31:00.369 --> 31:02.102
about what we're sitting on.

31:02.104 --> 31:04.403
This was the Upper Skagit Tribe area.

31:04.405 --> 31:07.073
They were around for
about 7,000 to 8,000 years,

31:07.075 --> 31:09.075
- apparently, on this land.
- Holy.

31:09.243 --> 31:10.807
Yeah.

31:10.809 --> 31:13.331
I got a photo of them
from the early 1900s.

31:14.713 --> 31:16.832
Now, 1840 is when the
white settlers came in.

31:16.949 --> 31:18.706
This is when they started
to push these guys out.

31:19.818 --> 31:22.250
After 50 years of fighting, eventually,

31:22.252 --> 31:24.656
the white settlers wiped
out nearly the entire tribe.

31:25.316 --> 31:28.816
We really have had a run of
bad luck since we moved here.

31:28.818 --> 31:34.153
We used to joke and say, "Did
we move on Indian burial ground?"

31:34.155 --> 31:36.389
Well, it's not a burial ground.

31:36.391 --> 31:39.259
It's kind of their dumping ground.

31:42.962 --> 31:45.662
So what else did you see on the walk?

31:45.664 --> 31:47.163
When I got here,

31:47.165 --> 31:52.169
I encountered a deceased
woman who was murdered.

31:54.538 --> 31:58.340
There were these two men
that were constantly with her.

31:58.342 --> 32:02.509
And they were preventing
her from speaking to me.

32:02.511 --> 32:06.412
They didn't want me to
find out who had killed her.

32:06.414 --> 32:08.548
I felt like she knew these two men.

32:08.550 --> 32:10.316
They were around at
the time of her murder,

32:10.318 --> 32:12.617
but they didn't directly do it.

32:12.619 --> 32:16.420
And the only thing that I
got on the man who killed her

32:16.422 --> 32:20.592
was that he did something
about, like, stealing money.

32:20.594 --> 32:23.193
I got that it was relatively recent.

32:23.195 --> 32:26.429
Uh, she died a horrible, horrible death.

32:26.431 --> 32:31.299
And I felt extremely sharp
pains in the neck and the head.

32:31.301 --> 32:33.356
I mean, it was awful, what he did.

32:37.371 --> 32:40.304
I'm sorry, guys. I'm having a neck pain.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.906
Yeah. It's bad here.

32:46.410 --> 32:47.543
This happens a lot to me.

32:47.545 --> 32:49.879
It just comes on out of nowhere.

32:49.881 --> 32:52.214
I taste blood in my mouth.
I feel like I can't breathe.

32:52.216 --> 32:54.248
- I feel like I'm choking.
- You okay?

32:54.250 --> 32:55.484
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

32:55.486 --> 32:57.380
Mm-hmm.

32:57.821 --> 32:59.853
So you guys mentioned there
might have been a murder.

32:59.855 --> 33:01.987
Literally, you can throw a
rock at where it happened.

33:01.989 --> 33:03.023
So I looked into it,

33:03.025 --> 33:04.757
and there was a murder of a woman.

33:04.759 --> 33:06.725
Her name was Vicki Silves.

33:06.727 --> 33:09.852
She and her husband, John,
moved next door in 1996.

33:11.173 --> 33:12.474
When they did move here,

33:12.476 --> 33:14.441
their marriage quickly went downhill.

33:14.443 --> 33:16.266
And John moved out within a few months.

33:17.079 --> 33:21.780
On December 8, 1997, Vicki
failed to show up for work.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.516
So her boss sent a coworker to the house

33:23.518 --> 33:24.750
to see if she was around.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.351
When he came here,

33:26.353 --> 33:30.684
he found her in the driveway
in a pool of her own blood.

33:31.490 --> 33:34.158
Now, you felt neck pain.

33:34.160 --> 33:37.393
She'd been stabbed in
the neck multiple times.

33:37.395 --> 33:39.731
I got a hold of the
death certificate here.

33:43.835 --> 33:45.852
Now, it's still an open case.

33:45.868 --> 33:48.069
And I was only able to get 40 pages

33:48.071 --> 33:50.805
out of a 160-page case folder.

33:50.807 --> 33:53.138
She had been at a party that night,

33:53.140 --> 33:55.475
and she was invited there
by a guy named Richard Brink.

33:55.477 --> 33:57.076
Apparently, she got drunk.

33:57.078 --> 33:59.465
And this guy, Richard Brink,
walks her back to the house.

33:59.547 --> 34:02.081
He admits to the cops that,

34:02.083 --> 34:04.681
when he gets there,
they start making out.

34:04.683 --> 34:06.416
She was very flirtatious all night.

34:06.418 --> 34:08.382
And then, she'd get violent with him.

34:08.587 --> 34:09.790
And then, she'd be okay again.

34:09.889 --> 34:12.789
Brink told the detectives that
he got fed up with her behavior,

34:12.791 --> 34:14.123
and he decided to leave.

34:14.126 --> 34:15.922
But he said, he left her, she was alive.

34:15.925 --> 34:17.891
He was never arrested.

34:17.893 --> 34:19.161
I tried tracking him down.

34:19.164 --> 34:20.860
I figured, let me talk to him myself.

34:20.862 --> 34:22.330
Uh, he's dead.

34:22.331 --> 34:26.632
He died in 2003 at the age
of 47 of a heart attack.

34:26.635 --> 34:28.935
But the other suspect was the husband,

34:28.937 --> 34:30.902
who she was estranged from.

34:30.905 --> 34:33.972
I spoke to him, and he had
a really rock-solid alibi.

34:33.974 --> 34:36.639
He was at least 3 hours away
the night she was murdered.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.577
He couldn't have been here
when the murder went down.

34:39.579 --> 34:40.380
I don't understand why the cops

34:40.480 --> 34:42.079
didn't take a closer look at Brink.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.248
But what I found interesting
was that, about 18 months

34:44.251 --> 34:45.416
after Vicki was murdered,

34:45.418 --> 34:47.150
John's mother got an anonymous letter.

34:47.152 --> 34:50.253
Basically said that she was
working at a local company,

34:50.255 --> 34:53.289
and she found out that
people were stealing money.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.257
And she told the wrong person.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.257
And then, they had her killed.

34:56.259 --> 34:59.061
It's still an open case.

34:59.063 --> 35:01.228
This theory is interesting to me,

35:01.230 --> 35:03.498
just because of all the different people

35:03.500 --> 35:05.965
that this dead female

35:05.967 --> 35:08.229
was showing me were
involved in her death.

35:08.302 --> 35:11.336
I know her killer is
dead because he's here.

35:11.338 --> 35:13.272
You think this is the same
person you came across,

35:13.372 --> 35:15.238
or you think it's somebody else?

35:15.240 --> 35:17.307
I had a sketch done of her.

35:22.144 --> 35:23.845
Take a look at that.

35:28.550 --> 35:30.485
Yeah. It could be her.

35:35.289 --> 35:36.460
They look similar.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.170
You okay?

35:41.172 --> 35:43.804
What do you think
when you see that face?

35:43.806 --> 35:45.273
Do you know her?

35:45.275 --> 35:46.407
I don't know.

35:46.409 --> 35:49.465
Have you felt her in
your room, in your bed?

35:49.911 --> 35:52.012
I can't breathe.

35:55.550 --> 35:58.217
What I was seeing, that
she'll get into the bed,

35:58.219 --> 36:01.342
and she'll wrap herself around you.

36:04.523 --> 36:06.523
And the reason why she does that

36:06.525 --> 36:09.893
is because she feels
safe from the two men.

36:09.895 --> 36:12.595
The problem is... is that
being in close proximity

36:12.597 --> 36:14.796
consistently with a dead person

36:14.798 --> 36:16.999
can not only make you extremely sick.

36:17.001 --> 36:23.572
It can also cause you to take
on the dead's personality,

36:23.574 --> 36:26.773
mannerisms, speech patterns.

36:26.775 --> 36:28.307
Melissa has changed a lot.

36:28.309 --> 36:29.643
I told her just the other night,

36:29.645 --> 36:31.077
I said she's not the
same woman I married.

36:31.079 --> 36:33.112
She's a completely different person.

36:33.114 --> 36:35.255
Sometimes, it's like
living with a stranger.

36:39.152 --> 36:41.818
This woman sat
on the end of the bed.

36:41.820 --> 36:45.021
She had, like, a skeleton face.

36:45.023 --> 36:49.791
She said, "You're gonna
die," or "Do you wanna die?"

36:49.793 --> 36:51.610
I couldn't... I couldn't figure it out.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.442
I was too scared.

36:53.444 --> 36:54.976
Okay.

36:54.978 --> 36:57.613
I did have a sketch done of what I saw.

37:00.750 --> 37:02.483
Oh.

37:10.391 --> 37:14.259
Yeah. I know... I know that.

37:14.261 --> 37:17.401
I have a... a lotta nightmares.

37:17.501 --> 37:21.202
And I feel a lotta pressure on me.

37:21.204 --> 37:24.838
It's like a snake.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.807
She's been complaining
of a lot of chest pain lately.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.075
She says it feels like a rubber
band's wrapped around her.

37:29.077 --> 37:32.466
She's killing you.

37:33.715 --> 37:36.347
When I sit down at the table at reveals,

37:36.349 --> 37:40.852
I will, like, tap the
people and scan them.

37:40.854 --> 37:43.354
What I saw around you was death.

38:12.345 --> 38:14.845
When I sit down at the table at reveals,

38:14.847 --> 38:19.548
I will, like, tap the
people and scan them.

38:19.550 --> 38:21.784
What I saw around you was death.

38:37.599 --> 38:39.765
You have a choice to make here.

38:40.001 --> 38:42.936
I know the choice.

38:48.876 --> 38:50.709
My god.

38:58.715 --> 39:00.182
I can't breathe.

39:04.487 --> 39:06.921
Sweetie, you're a fighter.

39:15.929 --> 39:20.097
Listen, I know you two got more
than you bargained for tonight.

39:20.099 --> 39:24.068
Um, the only good news is
that you know you're not crazy.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.702
Uh, but to see if there's
a way out of this mess,

39:26.704 --> 39:27.824
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:31.242 --> 39:36.012
This is, like, when my job really sucks.

39:38.014 --> 39:42.682
Sometimes, there are
those places and locations

39:42.684 --> 39:47.288
that just never should
have been inhabited.

39:48.456 --> 39:51.324
And this is one of those places.

39:54.594 --> 39:57.327
So, in this situation,

39:57.329 --> 40:01.965
for your very survival,

40:01.967 --> 40:03.165
you should leave.

40:04.036 --> 40:07.722
And you should leave
as soon as possible.

40:08.373 --> 40:11.173
So there's no way of putting up
a barrier or anything like that?

40:11.175 --> 40:15.508
I mean, the Native Americans
knew that this place was...

40:15.510 --> 40:17.545
was not livable.

40:17.547 --> 40:20.579
And they put their garbage here.

40:20.581 --> 40:24.083
Okay. So, if she leaves,
death would go away.

40:24.085 --> 40:26.032
If you make this choice, yes.

40:27.355 --> 40:30.690
If, for some reason, we can't go...

40:36.795 --> 40:38.329
I know.

40:38.331 --> 40:41.463
So if she moves away from here,
could she be like her friend

40:41.465 --> 40:43.515
Tamee, happy and healthy again?

40:44.868 --> 40:46.735
Yeah.

40:46.737 --> 40:51.141
Melissa's gotta make
the choice to be healthy.

40:52.474 --> 40:54.150
I'd have to send her,
and I'd have to stay.

40:54.944 --> 40:57.076
I can't move. I brought my mother here.

40:57.078 --> 40:59.322
I came back from the war, and
my mom wasn't doing too well.

40:59.413 --> 41:00.900
She's kind of wasting away.

41:01.449 --> 41:02.945
She wouldn't be able to leave.

41:03.784 --> 41:06.851
- You know I won't leave you.
- Thank you.

41:06.853 --> 41:08.728
I won't leave, I'll never leave you.

41:08.788 --> 41:11.131
Been with you 22 years, won't leave.

41:12.090 --> 41:14.624
I know it's a lot, but just
promise me you'll at least

41:14.724 --> 41:15.990
think about...

41:15.992 --> 41:16.959
- Oh, yeah.
- The advice.

41:16.961 --> 41:18.327
Promise you.

41:18.329 --> 41:20.528
- Okay.
- I understand.

41:21.030 --> 41:23.097
I think Melissa understands, as well,

41:23.099 --> 41:25.131
the... the gravity of the situation.

41:25.133 --> 41:28.570
We've gone through hell
since we've moved here.

41:28.670 --> 41:32.338
But I was hoping there
was gonna be a way out.

41:34.173 --> 41:36.673
The only way Melissa
and Brandon can be safe

41:36.675 --> 41:39.610
is to move as far away
from this land as possible.

41:39.612 --> 41:42.113
If they do that, they'll free themselves

41:42.115 --> 41:43.881
of the evil surrounding them

41:43.883 --> 41:46.283
and lead a healthy and peaceful life.
