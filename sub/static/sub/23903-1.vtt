00:28.867 --> 00:30.200
Get down on the ground!

00:30.242 --> 00:31.682
Everyone on the ground now!

00:32.867 --> 00:34.551
- Move! Move! Move!
- Get on the ground.

00:34.575 --> 00:36.075
Get your ass on the ground.

00:36.117 --> 00:37.884
- You, on the ground!
- Don't kill me.

00:37.908 --> 00:39.367
Get your ass down.

00:39.408 --> 00:40.450
Stay down!

00:40.492 --> 00:43.325
Eyes closed, people!

00:43.367 --> 00:46.033
Better to be a live
victim than a dead witness.

00:46.075 --> 00:47.825
- Take him!
- Oh, no! No!

00:47.867 --> 00:49.325
Walk, walk, walk!

00:49.367 --> 00:50.617
Walk!

00:50.658 --> 00:52.617
Open the door. Open it!

00:54.367 --> 00:55.867
Open it!

00:58.492 --> 01:00.533
What did I tell you? Keep
that fucking head down.

01:00.575 --> 01:01.783
Keep it down!

01:01.825 --> 01:03.450
Come on, come on.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.200
Get up! Move! Move!

01:26.408 --> 01:27.617
Open it.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.593
Stand your ass in the corner.

01:32.617 --> 01:34.075
Don't move.

01:55.658 --> 01:57.200
Give me the card. Give me the card.

01:58.325 --> 01:59.533
Walk.

02:07.242 --> 02:09.324
You want to be a hero?

02:09.366 --> 02:10.949
Some hero.

02:14.450 --> 02:15.575
Stand down!

02:17.283 --> 02:19.492
Stand down! We're outta here! Move!

02:19.533 --> 02:20.593
Anyone who goes near the door

02:20.617 --> 02:22.367
in the next five minutes gets shot.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.283
Go.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.158
Three, two, one.

02:51.367 --> 02:52.742
Clear!

02:52.783 --> 02:54.158
Move!

03:26.450 --> 03:29.033
Cole, take your car.
Cover the three-four.

03:29.075 --> 03:30.950
- Copy.
- Where do you need me, Hammond?

03:30.992 --> 03:32.367
Cole's got the three-four.

03:32.408 --> 03:33.950
- Take the rear.
- Gotcha.

03:33.992 --> 03:35.884
Keep your head down. We've
got active shooters inside.

03:35.908 --> 03:38.242
Copy.

03:38.283 --> 03:39.843
If he would've shown
up ten seconds sooner,

03:39.867 --> 03:41.492
- we would've been screwed.
- But he didn't.

03:41.533 --> 03:43.242
Unit 30-George is 10-90-7.

03:51.284 --> 03:56.284
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:35.575 --> 04:37.009
They're breaking down
outside containment.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.367
No sign of suspects.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.426
- What is it, Josh?
- Guy's got some serious head trauma.

04:45.450 --> 04:47.867
We're gonna need to transport.

04:47.908 --> 04:49.468
Why don't you jump
in the wagon with him?

04:49.492 --> 04:50.700
Get a statement.

04:50.742 --> 04:52.242
Do it.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.325
You break it, you buy it, asshole.

05:29.492 --> 05:31.117
Twenty "K" each.

05:31.158 --> 05:33.783
- Ooh!
- Leaves us 145.

05:33.825 --> 05:35.367
How much is this lawyer costing us?

05:35.408 --> 05:36.742
Retainer's 50 up front,

05:36.783 --> 05:38.950
the rest goes into the pension fund.

05:40.367 --> 05:43.533
Yeah, hope it hurts, pendejo.

05:43.575 --> 05:45.468
They ever gonna fix the air
conditioner in this place?

05:45.492 --> 05:47.117
All you do is complain, you know that?

05:47.158 --> 05:48.926
- Oh, shut up.
- So when are you seeing Tom?

05:48.950 --> 05:50.742
Tomorrow before shift.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.617
Well, tell him to expect a new lawyer.

05:53.658 --> 05:55.825
He's been asking to
talk to you in person.

05:55.867 --> 05:57.587
Explain to him that
now's not a good time.

05:57.617 --> 06:00.200
If this doesn't show we care,
then I don't know what does.

06:00.242 --> 06:03.575
Hey listen, it got noisy
today when it didn't have to.

06:03.617 --> 06:05.575
So everyone needs to check themselves.

06:05.617 --> 06:07.450
Give me a fucking break, man.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.593
If I didn't ring that kid's bell,

06:08.617 --> 06:09.908
he would've dropped one in me.

06:09.950 --> 06:11.910
He was down and you should
have left it at that.

06:14.158 --> 06:16.075
So if anyone asks
questions about the bank

06:16.117 --> 06:17.617
at the off-training party,

06:17.658 --> 06:18.867
I want to know about it.

06:18.908 --> 06:20.658
I completely forgot.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.093
Someone's gotta text me the day of.

06:22.117 --> 06:24.051
- Pathetic.
- Says the chica that lives by herself.

06:24.075 --> 06:25.242
She's right, Ramos.

06:25.283 --> 06:26.843
I've seen dogs with
longer leashes than you.

06:26.867 --> 06:28.950
- Bitch.
- Let's grab a drink to celebrate.

06:28.992 --> 06:29.992
- I'm buying.
- I'm in.

06:29.992 --> 06:31.408
Nope. Can't.

06:33.367 --> 06:34.783
So is it just me and you?

06:37.408 --> 06:38.700
Pass.

06:53.658 --> 06:54.992
Just add it to the pension.

07:02.283 --> 07:04.742
No one flakes Friday, alright?

07:04.783 --> 07:06.950
They're all gonna be deep,
so we need to represent.

07:17.950 --> 07:19.408
Yeah, buddy.

07:19.450 --> 07:21.370
You ever gonna fix the
damn air conditioner, man?

07:22.992 --> 07:25.158
Winter's coming, until then, use this.

07:27.408 --> 07:28.658
It's a cheap piece of shit.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.325
Just like you.

07:35.242 --> 07:37.867
Hey, I got nothing but
respect for your family,

07:37.908 --> 07:39.426
but you ever use that
tone with me again,

07:39.450 --> 07:41.325
I'll come across this
bar and beat your ass.

07:44.367 --> 07:46.075
Hamm, hold up.

07:49.325 --> 07:51.575
Cole could've given that
kid permanent brain damage.

07:53.242 --> 07:54.325
But he didn't.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.075
Don't blow this off.

07:56.117 --> 07:57.926
He's been out of control
ever since Tom got locked up,

07:57.950 --> 08:00.283
- and you took over.
- I'll get him under control.

08:00.325 --> 08:02.367
You won't. No one can.

08:03.867 --> 08:05.367
Just kick his ass out.

08:05.408 --> 08:06.575
Easy.

08:06.617 --> 08:07.718
If you don't, the other gangs

08:07.742 --> 08:08.884
are gonna see his lack of respect

08:08.908 --> 08:10.033
as a sign that we're weak.

08:10.075 --> 08:11.575
I'm telling you, Hamm,

08:11.617 --> 08:13.700
his attitude's gonna
encourage people like Winters

08:13.742 --> 08:15.218
and the Vipers to make moves against us.

08:15.242 --> 08:16.992
Pete...

08:17.033 --> 08:18.825
if he goes, I go.

08:18.867 --> 08:20.242
That's just the way it is.

08:36.866 --> 08:38.200
You got 15 minutes.

08:41.575 --> 08:43.491
I didn't ask for yard time.

08:43.533 --> 08:44.718
If you're told to use the yard,

08:44.742 --> 08:45.867
you use the yard.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.408
Okay.

09:05.825 --> 09:07.242
Who the hell's this?

09:07.283 --> 09:10.075
You know who this is and you
know what I'm calling about.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.384
Are you speaking for Neckbone now?

09:11.408 --> 09:13.450
I wouldn't be calling if I wasn't.

09:13.492 --> 09:15.759
And tell him, he'd better keep
his mouth shut about our business.

09:15.783 --> 09:17.492
You hear what the man said.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.408
Stay quiet, or else.

09:19.450 --> 09:21.658
You make this go away,
Winters, we all win.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.158
And Neckbone doesn't have to worry

09:23.200 --> 09:24.908
about anything, does he?

09:28.533 --> 09:30.700
We'll make it go away,
but if you run your mouth,

09:30.742 --> 09:33.408
then jail is gonna be
the least of your worries.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.867
Are you running the program here?

09:36.908 --> 09:38.242
Not yet.

09:38.283 --> 09:40.783
Okay. That's all I needed to know.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.742
Time's not up yet.

09:52.242 --> 09:54.492
Girl on the phone says I'm covered.

09:54.533 --> 09:56.700
For now.

09:56.742 --> 09:58.700
Okay.

10:02.992 --> 10:06.450
So... let's play a game.

10:07.575 --> 10:09.367
I don't play.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.242
Nah?

10:15.075 --> 10:16.617
Neither do I.

10:35.450 --> 10:37.492
You willing to risk this
fool gonna stay quiet?

10:39.575 --> 10:41.367
Troy Smith.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.200
Nigga took your oatmeal cookies.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.408
Lined 'em all up on the block.

10:45.450 --> 10:47.158
What a surprise when the nigga who told

10:47.200 --> 10:48.992
thought he was gettin' a treat.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.867
Dead men don't tell tales.

10:51.908 --> 10:53.408
That's what you told me.

10:55.242 --> 10:57.450
Maybe that's why we got her.

10:57.492 --> 10:58.783
It's called risk management.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.408
You getting soft?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.825
I'm getting soft?

11:07.533 --> 11:09.408
Boy, I'll snap your damn neck.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.533
You focus on this new shit
that just hit the street.

11:13.575 --> 11:15.575
I'll handle this, alright?

11:18.867 --> 11:19.950
Good job, boy.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.908
You know I love you, right?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.450
You're lucky you my brother.

11:25.492 --> 11:26.492
Let's go get some food.

11:28.367 --> 11:29.783
"Risk management."

11:33.158 --> 11:34.801
Couple of guys snagged
some chips last night.

11:34.825 --> 11:37.283
- Mostly purples.
- Really?

11:37.325 --> 11:38.408
We got one of 'em.

11:38.450 --> 11:40.825
The other one made it to the front door.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.825
I'll have someone at the
station follow up on it.

11:43.867 --> 11:45.325
I don't care about missing chips.

11:45.367 --> 11:47.158
I'm just tellin' ya because from now on,

11:47.200 --> 11:49.551
it's gonna be a lot tougher for
you to clean your money here.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.415
Security's gonna have a
tight eye on that cage.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.533
Got it.

11:53.575 --> 11:55.533
I'll put some time in at the tables.

12:24.033 --> 12:25.533
Maybe this isn't your game.

12:27.158 --> 12:29.408
Yeah, you're probably right.

12:29.450 --> 12:30.843
Maybe you could buy me a drink later?

12:30.867 --> 12:32.450
Explain the rules?

12:34.617 --> 12:35.908
At least lend me some luck.

12:35.950 --> 12:37.367
You gotta bring your own.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.783
House rules.

12:52.825 --> 12:55.117
- Pete! Pete!
- Hey, Pearl.

12:57.158 --> 12:59.950
There was a strange car
parked on the street yesterday.

12:59.992 --> 13:01.926
- Oh, yeah?
- I have a plate if you're interested.

13:01.950 --> 13:04.450
- I'm not.
- Well, they have no business being here.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.325
Ah, we own the houses,
Pearl, not the curbs.

13:06.367 --> 13:08.593
If they come back, I'm going to
ask them what they're doing, okay?

13:08.617 --> 13:09.825
No, don't do that.

13:09.867 --> 13:12.158
- Why?
- Because you're not a cop, Pearl!

13:12.200 --> 13:13.259
- But...
- And when I'm home,

13:13.283 --> 13:14.950
neither am I. I told you this already.

13:14.992 --> 13:15.992
Have a good one.

13:18.908 --> 13:21.158
- I'm home!
- Hey!

13:21.200 --> 13:22.742
Pearl came by.

13:22.783 --> 13:25.200
She said she needed to talk about a car.

13:25.242 --> 13:26.575
Yeah, I handled it.

13:26.617 --> 13:28.658
- How?
- Oh, the same way I do you.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.575
I listen real good, then I ignore it.

13:31.617 --> 13:32.908
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

13:32.950 --> 13:34.158
Oh!

13:36.450 --> 13:38.450
- You gonna ignore me now?
- Shut up, come here.

13:40.867 --> 13:42.325
Ew!

13:42.367 --> 13:44.408
Hey, come here, you little brat.

13:44.450 --> 13:46.075
Oh, I missed you so much.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.759
Did you get the dry cleaning?

13:47.783 --> 13:49.242
Yes, I did.

13:49.283 --> 13:51.742
Yeah, I hear that tone in your voice.

13:51.783 --> 13:53.658
I don't want to go any more than you do.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.676
Maybe we should just send 'em
a gift, and stay home, huh?

13:55.700 --> 13:57.200
I didn't quite hear that.

13:59.033 --> 14:00.617
I said I hope they like our gift.

14:00.658 --> 14:01.908
Uh-huh.

14:01.950 --> 14:03.533
That's what I thought you said.

14:03.575 --> 14:05.117
Come on, princessa, time for school.

14:05.158 --> 14:07.200
Have a good day, mama. Love you!

14:07.242 --> 14:08.242
Love you, too!

14:38.533 --> 14:40.075
Frank.

14:41.575 --> 14:42.992
She's new, right?

14:43.033 --> 14:44.950
Forget it, alright? She's not your type.

14:44.992 --> 14:46.867
Well, she seemed friendly enough.

14:46.908 --> 14:48.075
You're a shit gambler.

14:48.117 --> 14:49.825
She smiled at you
because that's her job.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.700
You hit on her.

14:54.742 --> 14:56.158
No.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.200
Frank...

14:58.242 --> 15:00.033
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

15:01.950 --> 15:04.700
Were the guys that
stole the chips Nigerian?

15:04.742 --> 15:06.242
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that

15:06.283 --> 15:07.801
every Nigerian that
walks through the door

15:07.825 --> 15:09.117
- is gonna be...
- Dirty?

15:09.158 --> 15:10.283
What?

15:14.033 --> 15:15.700
Get your ass up.

15:15.742 --> 15:16.867
Get outta here.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.408
Hey! Why'd you let him go?

15:22.450 --> 15:24.867
Everybody deserves a second chance.

15:45.075 --> 15:47.283
Neckbone sends a
message through Winters.

15:47.325 --> 15:49.492
Says he's working on
something to make this go away.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.408
Neckbone's full of shit.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.992
And so is the lawyer he got you.

15:54.033 --> 15:55.783
He shouldn't have had you do the pick up

15:55.825 --> 15:57.283
if he knew the guy felt wrong.

15:57.367 --> 16:00.033
Look, a man takes responsibility
for his own actions.

16:00.075 --> 16:01.468
I could've walked away at any point.

16:01.492 --> 16:02.992
So it's on me, not him.

16:10.867 --> 16:12.242
You make that withdrawal?

16:12.283 --> 16:13.408
Yeah.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.575
Exactly like you laid it out.

16:16.658 --> 16:18.533
ATM cartridges only.

16:18.575 --> 16:19.658
Yeah, good.

16:21.283 --> 16:24.033
We're getting you a better lawyer, okay?

16:24.075 --> 16:26.742
Someone with more pull
over at the DA's office.

16:28.658 --> 16:31.325
Steve too busy to come here
and tell me that himself?

16:33.033 --> 16:34.617
He's just got a lot on his plate.

16:34.658 --> 16:36.033
If he can't handle the pressure,

16:36.075 --> 16:37.742
he shouldn't have stepped up.

16:37.783 --> 16:41.325
Jesus, I thought he was
gonna do better than this.

16:45.242 --> 16:46.634
Look, I'm sure your mother is gonna want

16:46.658 --> 16:49.658
to visit me at some
point, don't let her.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.742
I don't want her to
see me like this, okay?

16:53.700 --> 16:55.325
Yeah, Dad, I got it.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.617
Okay, son.

17:07.325 --> 17:09.075
She wants the house,

17:09.117 --> 17:11.700
the good car, and half my salary.

17:11.742 --> 17:13.407
Plus, I gotta keep paying the mortgage.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.825
So, how am I supposed to do
that on half a goddamn salary?

17:15.867 --> 17:17.742
- Cheaper to keep her.
- Yeah.

17:17.782 --> 17:19.782
She's the one who wants
the divorce, not me.

17:20.992 --> 17:22.617
Grow some balls.

17:22.657 --> 17:23.968
And instead of whining to me about it,

17:23.992 --> 17:25.009
why don't you talk to Winters?

17:25.032 --> 17:26.407
Tell her you need a bigger taste?

17:26.450 --> 17:27.992
Winters is all about herself.

17:28.032 --> 17:29.492
Just lucky we get the crumbs.

17:29.533 --> 17:31.533
So vote her out.

17:31.575 --> 17:33.575
- You done?
- Yeah.

17:33.617 --> 17:36.533
- Coffee? Dessert?
- No, just the check, please.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.492
You bore me when you're like this.

17:46.408 --> 17:47.950
I got this.

17:50.325 --> 17:52.992
I get how this can be confusing.

17:53.033 --> 17:54.117
What do you mean?

17:55.117 --> 17:56.343
You think I sit here and listen

17:56.367 --> 17:59.033
to your whiny bullshit because I care.

17:59.075 --> 18:01.700
You're driving the car,
and I'm just the passenger.

18:01.742 --> 18:03.658
I mean, you're a good
ride, Foster, but...

18:04.658 --> 18:06.283
I'm the driver.

18:06.325 --> 18:07.408
Not you.

18:16.242 --> 18:18.450
What are you doing here?

18:18.492 --> 18:19.658
Checking on my mom.

18:21.408 --> 18:23.242
She still is my mother.

18:23.283 --> 18:24.450
Is that you, Steve?

18:25.450 --> 18:26.742
Yeah, Ma.

18:28.242 --> 18:30.117
Got you a few things from the store.

18:31.117 --> 18:32.867
He complaining about me again?

18:32.908 --> 18:35.450
You both do your fair
share of complaining.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.075
Can you stay for dinner?

18:39.117 --> 18:41.259
Not if he's gonna be talking
about Dad while I'm eating.

18:41.283 --> 18:43.867
- Don't you even...
- What?

18:43.908 --> 18:46.492
I don't know why you defend the old man.

18:46.533 --> 18:49.242
He got a Green Card and a
whole new start 'cause of you.

18:50.450 --> 18:51.950
What did you get?

18:51.992 --> 18:53.158
You.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.992
And your brother.

18:56.033 --> 18:57.492
Yeah.

18:59.783 --> 19:01.325
You look tired.

19:01.367 --> 19:02.825
You did chemo this morning, right?

19:04.617 --> 19:05.950
I'm fine.

19:05.992 --> 19:08.200
Dinner's gonna be
ready in about an hour.

19:08.242 --> 19:11.908
Why don't you go watch
the game with your brother?

19:11.950 --> 19:14.742
No, he's been acting like
an asshole lately, so no.

19:22.033 --> 19:24.193
Is there a reason why we're
doing this differently now?

19:26.783 --> 19:28.783
Yeah, the casino won't work anymore.

19:29.908 --> 19:31.783
I need another way to explain the cash.

19:33.950 --> 19:35.950
Well, I can't... I can't
have anyone questioning

19:35.992 --> 19:38.700
my Social Security eligibility, Steve.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.283
I know.

19:40.325 --> 19:43.117
I could... lose my health benefits.

19:43.158 --> 19:45.117
Did something happen with Frank?

19:45.158 --> 19:48.158
- Is that it?
- No, Frankie and I are good.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.575
It's just temporary.

19:49.617 --> 19:51.158
Talk to me.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.492
Something happened?

19:54.283 --> 19:56.117
If it was serious, I'd tell you.

19:56.158 --> 19:57.950
I promise.

19:57.992 --> 19:59.617
You.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.742
You Code Four?

20:29.783 --> 20:31.533
Would've put it out if we weren't.

20:35.283 --> 20:36.783
Nice.

20:36.825 --> 20:39.185
Be interesting to see how much
of that actually gets booked.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.492
How's your old man doing?

20:43.533 --> 20:44.908
Why?

20:44.950 --> 20:47.325
You gonna pretend that you care?

20:47.367 --> 20:48.783
I care.

20:48.825 --> 20:51.117
Matter of fact, I talked
to him on the phone.

20:51.158 --> 20:53.325
Neckbone and I both care.

20:53.367 --> 20:56.325
So now you're Neckbone's
Welfare Queen, huh?

20:56.367 --> 20:58.617
Someone had to take your dad's place.

21:27.367 --> 21:29.450
The other one. Spread your legs.

21:35.408 --> 21:36.950
- Here you go, man.
- Alright, man.

21:36.992 --> 21:38.158
Get out of here.

21:39.158 --> 21:40.533
Get your ass outta here.

21:43.950 --> 21:46.150
What the hell are you
searching for? Weapons or fries?

21:46.908 --> 21:48.617
I'm looking for a hamburger.

21:55.242 --> 21:56.492
Officer Beach!

21:57.867 --> 21:59.033
Officer Beach!

22:23.492 --> 22:25.533
Hands!

22:32.117 --> 22:33.783
Is there a problem, Officer?

22:39.617 --> 22:41.075
What the hell's this?

22:43.367 --> 22:45.908
Hands where we can see 'em, gentlemen.

22:45.950 --> 22:47.533
- Are you serious?
- Relax, we're cops.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.700
Yeah, we know.

23:02.825 --> 23:04.950
And where were you
planning on running to?

23:06.033 --> 23:07.783
Anywhere but their back seat.

23:19.575 --> 23:22.175
So you guys know they're just
trying to get in our heads, right?

23:33.533 --> 23:34.950
I'm Agent Price.

23:37.492 --> 23:39.325
And I know all about the Ravens.

23:52.825 --> 23:57.283
That poor girl is gonna
need a lot of therapy.

23:57.325 --> 23:58.825
And what's that got to do with me?

23:58.867 --> 24:01.408
Three bank robbers got
in, three cops got out.

24:01.450 --> 24:03.700
Any jury's gonna be able
to do the math on that one.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.593
- Looks Photoshopped.
- You think your wife's gonna wait 30 years for you?

24:06.617 --> 24:08.200
Or do you think she's gonna move on?

24:08.242 --> 24:11.075
If you lawyer up, you lose
your chance to help yourself.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.242
I'm not saying anything without Counsel.

24:13.283 --> 24:15.700
The rest of the Ravens
are already cutting deals.

24:15.742 --> 24:18.158
- Now's your chance to do the same.
- Tell me something.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.742
Is your ass jealous of the shit
that comes out of your mouth?

24:24.200 --> 24:25.551
We have identified a dozen

24:25.575 --> 24:26.950
cop gangs within your department.

24:26.992 --> 24:28.450
Gangs?

24:28.492 --> 24:29.908
Don't believe the hype.

24:29.950 --> 24:31.575
They're just social clubs.

24:31.617 --> 24:33.343
Oh, yeah? Well then, I
guess I'm putting together

24:33.367 --> 24:35.533
a RICO case on social clubs.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.325
- Hmm.
- You can play dumb all you want.

24:37.367 --> 24:38.700
It's not gonna do you any good.

24:38.742 --> 24:40.634
We've had our eye on your
department for a while.

24:40.658 --> 24:43.158
Cops on the take, working
with high-level drug dealers,

24:43.200 --> 24:44.200
and then there's this.

24:44.242 --> 24:45.325
So now you've got a choice.

24:45.367 --> 24:46.759
You can either help us take 'em down

24:46.783 --> 24:48.033
or you can go to prison.

24:59.033 --> 25:00.950
I need to know where the money is.

25:00.992 --> 25:02.658
We already spent a chunk of it.

25:02.700 --> 25:04.700
And what's left is in the general fund.

25:04.742 --> 25:05.950
Yeah, we take that back,

25:05.992 --> 25:07.825
it'll make the rest of
the Ravens suspicious.

25:07.867 --> 25:09.533
Mm-hmm.

25:09.575 --> 25:11.468
You'll be released within the
hour, but that doesn't mean

25:11.492 --> 25:13.301
that the money doesn't
need to be accounted for.

25:14.742 --> 25:16.242
Oh, see.

25:16.283 --> 25:18.367
I knew there was
something weird about him.

25:21.867 --> 25:23.908
You've no doubt seen Agent
Byrd around the station

25:23.950 --> 25:25.176
over the last couple of months.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.200
He's a Fed.

25:26.242 --> 25:27.825
He is.

25:27.867 --> 25:29.968
And he's gonna make an
excellent Raven, don't you think?

25:29.992 --> 25:31.658
Hell no!

25:31.700 --> 25:33.843
How else can I make sure that
you're not gonna violate the deal?

25:33.867 --> 25:36.908
They see us with this guy,
we're toast. He's weak!

25:36.950 --> 25:38.908
- That's bullshit.
- It's not.

25:38.950 --> 25:40.908
Everyone at the station
thinks you're a dick.

25:40.950 --> 25:43.617
This is not up for negotiation.

25:43.658 --> 25:45.617
Agent Byrd will be joining the Ravens,

25:45.658 --> 25:47.908
and you will be taking orders from him.

25:47.950 --> 25:49.700
And if either Agent Byrd or I

25:49.742 --> 25:51.158
feel that you're not cooperating,

25:51.200 --> 25:52.867
the indictment's gonna be made public,

25:52.908 --> 25:54.867
and you'll all be re-arrested.

26:10.033 --> 26:11.783
I know all about the Ravens.

26:16.658 --> 26:17.992
What are we gonna do now?

26:19.033 --> 26:20.658
We're screwed.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.367
They've been on us for weeks.

26:23.408 --> 26:24.968
You can either help us take them down

26:24.992 --> 26:26.117
or you can go to prison.

26:45.617 --> 26:46.992
So what's the play?

26:48.283 --> 26:50.367
I say Mexico.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.218
You got family down there
you can trust, right?

26:52.242 --> 26:53.825
I'm fourth generation, babosa.

26:53.867 --> 26:55.467
I don't even know
anybody down in Mexico.

26:55.492 --> 26:56.825
Nobody's leaving.

26:56.867 --> 26:58.992
If one of us splits, we all get screwed.

26:59.033 --> 27:02.367
We're gonna play the game
until we figure a way out.

27:02.408 --> 27:05.783
But right now, our
biggest problem is Byrd.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.992
I want to just punch him in the throat.

27:08.033 --> 27:10.367
Look, to make this work, we
need to sell him as a Raven.

27:11.408 --> 27:12.617
Good luck with that.

27:18.575 --> 27:21.158
Listen, something's come
up since we talked last.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.992
It's not over like I thought.

27:25.658 --> 27:27.158
I can't say exactly.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.658
Maybe another month or two?

27:30.492 --> 27:33.867
It's a RICO case now, and
those don't have a clock on 'em.

27:33.908 --> 27:35.908
Can you put my son on the phone?

27:52.658 --> 27:53.867
Trouble?

27:55.492 --> 27:57.450
It's my kid's birthday today.

27:57.492 --> 27:59.825
- How old is he?
- Seven.

27:59.867 --> 28:01.408
Seven.

28:01.450 --> 28:03.158
Kids are a breeze at seven.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.325
Mine are 18.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.367
Two twins who want to go to college.

28:06.408 --> 28:09.158
Do you have any idea how
much tuition costs nowadays?

28:09.200 --> 28:10.551
What kinda window are we looking at?

28:10.575 --> 28:11.908
It's hard to say.

28:11.950 --> 28:13.617
It depends on where the case takes us.

28:13.658 --> 28:15.551
I didn't sign up for
something long term like this.

28:15.575 --> 28:18.283
You're stressing over missing
a 7-year-old's birthday?

28:18.325 --> 28:20.533
Give me a break! If I made
it home for a birthday,

28:20.575 --> 28:24.492
or a special event once a
year, I considered it a win.

28:24.533 --> 28:27.283
But that's just me. You're
free to quit at any time.

28:50.867 --> 28:52.742
When I tell you to be somewhere at 8:00,

28:52.783 --> 28:54.408
it means just that.

28:54.450 --> 28:56.492
So how are we gonna do this?

28:56.533 --> 28:58.453
You gonna introduce me
to the other Ravens first?

28:59.658 --> 29:00.950
No.

29:00.992 --> 29:03.367
I run the program, they
don't question my choices.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.950
And in front of them, neither do you.

29:04.992 --> 29:06.158
Get inside.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.325
Yo. Have a drink.

29:40.367 --> 29:42.408
I'm good.

29:42.450 --> 29:43.926
It's an off-training party, dumbass.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.700
Have a drink so you
look like everyone else.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.825
You work for me, not
the other way around.

29:47.867 --> 29:49.283
Have a drink, Byrd.

29:49.325 --> 29:51.700
Those guys right there
eyeballing us are Berserkers.

29:51.742 --> 29:54.242
I know about 'em. Racist assholes.

29:54.283 --> 29:56.176
And because of that, they're
just itching for a reason

29:56.200 --> 29:57.283
to light your fuse.

29:57.325 --> 29:58.634
If we didn't show you how to act,

29:58.658 --> 30:00.575
they'd eat you alive,
so listen to what we say.

30:33.367 --> 30:36.700
Hey, what are you talking
to a Viper for, huh?

30:36.742 --> 30:38.783
- Is it your business?
- Yes.

30:38.825 --> 30:40.992
It's my business.

30:41.033 --> 30:43.450
Fuck a guy once and
he thinks he owns you.

30:45.367 --> 30:47.117
We were both drunk,

30:47.158 --> 30:48.700
and you weren't that good.

30:48.742 --> 30:51.033
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:52.617 --> 30:56.408
I'm asking as a Raven, okay?

30:56.450 --> 30:58.950
So what were you talking to him about?

31:01.033 --> 31:02.783
He was curious about Byrd.

31:02.825 --> 31:04.283
In what way?

31:06.617 --> 31:09.742
In a curious way.

31:26.325 --> 31:27.742
What a dick.

31:35.325 --> 31:38.158
Jesus. He looks like he's
on goddamn surveillance.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.825
Because he is.

31:39.867 --> 31:41.093
Winters jammed me up at the bar.

31:41.117 --> 31:42.950
Told me to tell you
there's a summit in ten.

31:45.450 --> 31:46.658
About what?

31:46.700 --> 31:48.408
- She didn't say.
- Jesus, Pete.

31:48.450 --> 31:50.908
- We need him to relax or get the hell out.
- Yeah.

31:53.658 --> 31:54.908
I'm on it.

31:57.075 --> 31:58.825
- Wanna do me a favor?
- Yeah.

31:58.867 --> 32:00.747
See that guy in the
burgundy shirt over there?

32:02.742 --> 32:03.992
Thanks, baby.

32:14.158 --> 32:15.492
I'm calling this meeting

32:15.533 --> 32:17.492
'cause we need to
re-establish some ground rules.

32:17.533 --> 32:20.700
- About what?
- You been hitting their stash houses again, Kilvinsky?

32:20.742 --> 32:22.426
We don't truck in this
drama queen's hood.

32:22.450 --> 32:24.200
We got our own cash
cows on the east side.

32:24.242 --> 32:27.033
You guys were seen sniffing
around meth labs in our area.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.367
Why?

32:28.408 --> 32:30.825
Legitimate follow-up on
a domestic violence case.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.093
Nothing to do with the agreement.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.825
You didn't tax them?

32:33.867 --> 32:35.992
We earn plenty from the
Ukrainians. Why would we?

32:36.033 --> 32:37.783
You must have. It was a cook,

32:37.825 --> 32:39.242
and they didn't go to jail.

32:39.283 --> 32:41.200
You got specifics, Winters?

32:41.242 --> 32:43.700
If not, it's just you being
the paranoid bitch that you are.

32:43.742 --> 32:45.408
There's an agreement already in place.

32:45.450 --> 32:47.533
We only earn within the
boundaries we patrol.

32:47.575 --> 32:49.617
If you tax them, Kilvinsky,
you're in the wrong.

32:49.658 --> 32:50.843
Give her the goddamn money,

32:50.867 --> 32:52.093
and let's get this thing over with!

32:52.117 --> 32:55.075
That ain't gonna cut
it. I want a sanction.

32:55.117 --> 32:58.408
- Like what?
- I want all the dope tax north of the freeway.

32:58.450 --> 33:00.242
- Here we go.
- Not gonna happen.

33:00.283 --> 33:02.658
You still get the south bay
as well as the west side.

33:02.700 --> 33:04.718
The hell are you talking
about? We're not going for that!

33:04.742 --> 33:06.158
You're not in charge, Winters.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.658
We all run our own program.

33:07.700 --> 33:08.783
Damn straight.

33:08.825 --> 33:10.200
Make this right, Kilvinsky.

33:13.283 --> 33:14.450
Fine.

33:15.492 --> 33:17.533
We'll kick you back the tax.

33:17.575 --> 33:18.700
Plus interest.

33:21.908 --> 33:23.593
You're lucky you're
getting what you're getting.

33:23.617 --> 33:25.259
Exactly. You're lucky to get anything.

33:25.283 --> 33:26.908
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's correct.

33:26.950 --> 33:28.593
I try to give you
something every single time.

33:28.617 --> 33:29.867
There's always something else.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.783
And all you do is talk, talk, talk.

33:42.242 --> 33:44.200
- What's that?
- I just got a text.

33:44.242 --> 33:46.075
We're on for a meet
tomorrow night with Sleep.

33:46.117 --> 33:47.908
Same place as last time.

33:47.950 --> 33:49.742
Sleep?

33:49.783 --> 33:51.575
That somebody I need to know about?

33:51.617 --> 33:54.283
It's a guy we deal with.
Nobody you're ready to meet.

33:54.325 --> 33:55.617
Who's this?

33:55.658 --> 33:56.950
He's with us.

33:56.992 --> 33:58.658
A new Raven, huh? You got a name?

33:58.700 --> 34:00.450
Byrd.

34:00.492 --> 34:02.825
We were in the middle of a
conversation, do you mind?

34:02.867 --> 34:04.075
Yeah, no problem.

34:04.117 --> 34:05.325
Just getting a beer.

34:12.699 --> 34:13.908
What was that about?

34:15.074 --> 34:16.408
You're a new face, man.

34:16.449 --> 34:18.324
People are gonna be curious.

34:18.367 --> 34:20.449
So, what's the meeting
about tomorrow night?

34:20.492 --> 34:22.074
I dunno.

34:22.117 --> 34:24.658
Sleep is a sketchy
son-of-a-bitch.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.242
It could be something.

34:26.283 --> 34:28.384
It could be Sleep just running
his mouth like he usually does.

34:28.408 --> 34:29.699
We'll let you know, Birdman.

34:48.574 --> 34:51.658
Why don't you come
outside with me, Birdie?

34:51.699 --> 34:53.117
Hey, hey, hey.

34:57.575 --> 34:59.033
Come on, let's have fun!

34:59.075 --> 35:00.325
How do you know my name?

35:03.825 --> 35:05.408
Watch it, dumbass.

35:05.450 --> 35:08.700
- My bad.
- Yeah, it was.

35:08.742 --> 35:11.158
Now be a good little
"brotha" and go take a walk

35:11.200 --> 35:12.575
before you get hurt.

35:14.992 --> 35:16.242
What?

35:16.283 --> 35:19.533
Are you mad at me talking
to you like that, boy?

35:19.575 --> 35:21.158
I'm not your boy.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.533
Alright, alright, alright!

35:44.575 --> 35:46.742
Chill out.

35:52.033 --> 35:53.176
Y'all know there's no fighting

35:53.200 --> 35:54.742
while we're all under the same roof.

35:55.742 --> 35:56.783
Cool it.

35:57.825 --> 35:59.700
You want some? Come on.

36:04.033 --> 36:05.408
You want some too?

36:05.450 --> 36:07.117
Whatchu lookin' at?

36:08.950 --> 36:10.575
Simmer down, simmer down.

36:10.617 --> 36:12.158
Sit your ass down!

36:18.033 --> 36:21.033
Looks like you had one too many, Byrd.

36:21.075 --> 36:23.301
Listen man, why don't you park
it right here for the night

36:23.325 --> 36:25.742
- and let Cole take you home?
- Screw you.

36:25.783 --> 36:27.242
Somebody put something in my drink.

36:27.283 --> 36:28.468
You mean like ice cubes or what?

36:28.492 --> 36:30.533
- You think this is funny?
- Relax, relax.

36:32.658 --> 36:35.575
Listen, man, you did good tonight.

36:35.617 --> 36:38.033
You held your own in front
of the Berserkers, man.

36:38.075 --> 36:39.867
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah!

36:39.908 --> 36:41.450
Now you look like one of us.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.492
Who's Sleep?

36:45.533 --> 36:47.492
Why are you meeting
with him tomorrow night?

36:47.533 --> 36:50.492
- Man, like I said, you're not ready.
- Bullshit!

36:50.533 --> 36:51.867
From now on, I'm making...

36:51.908 --> 36:53.593
You can't even fit in
with these pendejos,

36:53.617 --> 36:55.242
let alone a dude like Sleep!

37:00.450 --> 37:02.367
You refusing to do what I say?

37:06.033 --> 37:07.325
Thought so.

37:27.617 --> 37:29.617
What the hell happened to you?

37:29.658 --> 37:31.742
You wanted me to fit in, right?

37:31.783 --> 37:33.283
This is what it looks like.

37:33.325 --> 37:35.117
Good.

37:35.158 --> 37:37.575
Now it feels like
you're in it to win it.

37:39.158 --> 37:40.384
Look, I know you want to go home,

37:40.408 --> 37:41.926
but a case like this is worth the grief.

37:41.950 --> 37:43.992
We can both ride this
thing to a promotion.

37:44.033 --> 37:45.867
No case is worth getting a divorce over.

37:45.908 --> 37:47.950
Relationships can be rebuilt, Damon.

37:47.992 --> 37:49.575
Careers not so much.

37:49.617 --> 37:51.492
- You still married?
- Nope.

37:51.533 --> 37:52.658
Exactly.

37:54.908 --> 37:57.575
You, uh, you ever hear about
a local gangster named Sleep?

37:59.867 --> 38:02.992
Cornell Barnes. They call him
Sleep because he never does.

38:03.033 --> 38:04.908
Is he a big player?

38:04.950 --> 38:06.658
His brother Neckbone's bigger.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.117
Sleep is a functioning coke-head.

38:08.158 --> 38:09.801
He does a lot of the
dirty work. What about him?

38:09.825 --> 38:11.575
Ravens are meeting with him tonight.

38:11.617 --> 38:14.200
Makes sense. They've both got
a lot of cops on the payroll.

38:14.242 --> 38:16.200
- I'll be at the meeting.
- Good.

38:16.242 --> 38:18.283
Press him about his brother, Neckbone.

38:18.325 --> 38:20.051
We get our hooks into him,
we can go up on a wire.

38:20.075 --> 38:21.742
Get his suppliers. What is it?

38:21.783 --> 38:23.009
You wanted me to remind you about

38:23.033 --> 38:24.367
the status update meeting, ma'am.

38:24.408 --> 38:25.408
The SAC's waiting.

38:25.450 --> 38:27.242
I'll let you know how it goes.

38:27.283 --> 38:28.923
You get us Neckbone, and I can guarantee

38:28.950 --> 38:30.992
you'll land an ASAC
assignment closer to home.

38:49.325 --> 38:50.575
He's solo?

38:50.617 --> 38:52.700
Rolled up by himself.

38:52.742 --> 38:54.283
I circled the block.

38:54.325 --> 38:56.492
I didn't see anyone
hugging the gutters, man.

38:56.533 --> 38:58.617
Does he usually have back-up?

38:58.658 --> 39:00.117
Sometimes.

39:00.158 --> 39:03.117
He's a paranoid cabron, so
it changes up all the time.

39:03.158 --> 39:05.117
Not "tinfoil hat" paranoid.

39:05.158 --> 39:06.617
"Shoot you in the face" paranoid.

39:06.658 --> 39:08.867
Mm-hmm, that's why
you need to stay here.

39:08.908 --> 39:10.367
Let us deal with him.

39:10.408 --> 39:13.158
Yeah, we'll fill you in on
the details after the meet.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.533
Hell no.

39:17.575 --> 39:19.575
- Ain't happening.
- He's gonna get us killed.

39:19.617 --> 39:21.117
It's not up for debate.

39:54.533 --> 39:55.783
I see Hammond.

39:55.825 --> 39:56.950
I see Cole.

39:58.117 --> 39:59.742
I see Ramos.

39:59.783 --> 40:01.575
I see the Bitch.

40:01.617 --> 40:03.575
It's pronounced "Beach."

40:06.325 --> 40:07.867
I also see a new face.

40:09.908 --> 40:10.992
Why?

40:12.742 --> 40:14.117
Name's Byrd.

40:15.867 --> 40:17.325
Why is Byrd here?

40:20.867 --> 40:23.227
You know I don't like bringing
strange weeds into my garden.

40:27.242 --> 40:28.825
How do I know Byrd ain't a cop?

40:30.283 --> 40:31.700
We're all cops, Sleep.

40:34.825 --> 40:36.283
You're a crazy motherfucker.

40:43.867 --> 40:46.367
I need an answer from you.
You ever seen this shit before?

40:46.408 --> 40:47.867
No. What is it?

40:47.908 --> 40:50.617
The package says Weapon
of Mass Destruction.

40:50.658 --> 40:53.242
But the only thing it's
destroying is my brother's profits.

40:53.283 --> 40:54.367
It's some synthetic shit.

40:54.408 --> 40:55.617
Who's moving it?

40:55.658 --> 40:56.908
I don't know.

40:56.950 --> 40:58.492
That's what I need you for.

41:00.033 --> 41:02.325
Open bounty for the
first person to find out.

41:02.367 --> 41:04.176
Ain't no prize for second
place, you feelin' me?

41:04.200 --> 41:05.658
We can do that.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.593
You want it stopped.
We'll see what we can do.

41:07.617 --> 41:09.492
No. I want to find out who makes it.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.033
It's the future. I want to live in it.

41:13.450 --> 41:14.742
We'll look into it.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.700
Looks like a pharmaceutical.

41:20.908 --> 41:22.367
I don't like his eyes, Hammond.

41:24.408 --> 41:25.867
Close your eyes, Byrd.

41:29.367 --> 41:31.575
- We done?
- No.

41:32.742 --> 41:34.408
Tell me about yourself, new guy.

41:35.950 --> 41:38.117
- What?
- You're a Raven, right?

41:38.158 --> 41:39.700
Show me your tattoo.

41:39.742 --> 41:41.992
He hasn't got it yet. Been busy.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.658
"Busy."

41:43.700 --> 41:44.783
Busy.

41:45.867 --> 41:47.117
Let me see your phone.

41:47.158 --> 41:48.283
Why?

41:48.325 --> 41:49.343
'Cause a man's phone tells me

41:49.367 --> 41:50.801
everything I need to know about him.

41:50.825 --> 41:54.283
- Sleep, get back in the car.
- Hammond, stay out of this.

41:54.325 --> 41:55.676
- Cut the shit.
- Go home.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.009
Look, if you don't show me his phone,

41:57.033 --> 41:58.343
I'm gonna start thinking this a set-up.

41:58.367 --> 42:00.367
Give him the damn phone.

42:09.283 --> 42:11.117
You call your mom a lot, huh, new guy?

42:12.450 --> 42:13.700
That's sweet.

42:13.742 --> 42:15.218
Okay, you've seen it.
Now give me my phone.

42:15.242 --> 42:16.617
Hey, hey, relax.

42:19.117 --> 42:20.700
Let's give your mother a call.

42:20.742 --> 42:22.283
See how she doin'.

42:30.408 --> 42:33.450
Your mother got a real deep voice.

42:33.492 --> 42:35.700
- Put it down, Sleep. Put it down!
- What are you doing?

42:35.742 --> 42:37.884
This snitch-ass nigga a
Fed! You tried to set me up.

42:37.908 --> 42:40.009
- He ain't a Fed! Put the goddamn gun down.
- Be smart, Sleep!

42:40.033 --> 42:42.176
The number he just dialed on my
cell phone was the FBI office.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.218
- Son of a bitch.
- Listen, you can't let him leave right now!

42:44.242 --> 42:45.718
If you do, you're just
as screwed as I am.

42:45.742 --> 42:47.134
- Do you wanna die?
- Don't let him do this!

42:47.158 --> 42:48.658
- Shut up.
- Sleep.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.700
Listen to me, man. You
got leverage right now.

42:50.742 --> 42:52.242
Think about it.

42:52.283 --> 42:53.718
None of us wants this
to hit the streets.

42:53.742 --> 42:55.200
And you don't want to go to jail.

42:55.242 --> 42:57.408
Good news. Byrd can cut you a deal.

42:57.450 --> 42:58.575
He's telling the truth.

42:58.617 --> 43:00.492
He's telling the truth. I can fix this!

43:00.533 --> 43:01.825
Do the right thing, Sleep!

43:01.867 --> 43:03.283
Think about it, Sleep.

43:03.325 --> 43:05.658
I am. I don't snitch.

43:05.700 --> 43:07.950
- Go, go, go, go!
- Shit!

43:07.992 --> 43:09.742
Byrd, get your ass up!

43:11.075 --> 43:12.242
Go, go, go, go!

43:16.158 --> 43:17.700
I'm on him! I'm on him!

43:17.742 --> 43:19.783
Come on!

43:19.825 --> 43:21.367
Left! Left! Left!

43:24.158 --> 43:25.325
I got him, I got him.

43:29.117 --> 43:30.992
Come on!

43:31.033 --> 43:32.492
Clear!

43:35.200 --> 43:36.450
That way, that way!

43:42.783 --> 43:44.367
Come on! You son of a bitch!

43:45.408 --> 43:47.158
- Go! Go! Go!
- Up top! Up top!

43:47.200 --> 43:48.575
Go, go, go, go!

43:51.283 --> 43:52.658
Go round the side!

43:54.408 --> 43:55.783
Come on!

43:56.950 --> 43:58.325
I see him!

43:58.367 --> 44:00.158
I'm on him! I'm on him!

44:04.575 --> 44:06.075
You see him? You see him?

44:07.658 --> 44:09.551
- Come on!
- He's right there! Go up top! Go up top!

44:09.575 --> 44:11.325
He's jumping the roof!

44:11.367 --> 44:12.992
- Shit, come on!
- He jumped!

44:13.033 --> 44:14.867
- He jumped!
- Watch out, Hammond!

44:19.033 --> 44:20.575
- Come on!
- Come on, this way!

44:54.950 --> 44:56.408
Get your shit together.

44:56.450 --> 44:57.730
What are we gonna do now?

45:02.908 --> 45:04.075
Byrd.

45:06.533 --> 45:08.283
We can't call this in.

45:10.950 --> 45:13.242
Too many people are on
his brother's payroll.

45:13.283 --> 45:14.477
So, if the uniforms show up,

45:14.478 --> 45:16.051
they're gonna wanna know
why Sleep ran from us.

45:16.075 --> 45:18.492
And that means Neckbone
is gonna have questions.

45:18.533 --> 45:19.700
Ones we can't answer.

45:19.742 --> 45:21.283
We didn't kill him.

45:21.325 --> 45:23.450
It was an accident, you understand?

45:23.492 --> 45:25.783
You're saying we just walk away?

45:25.825 --> 45:27.117
It's not that simple.

45:28.283 --> 45:30.408
We can't just leave the body.

45:30.450 --> 45:32.492
If Sleep's people know
he was meeting with us...

45:36.492 --> 45:37.617
No way!

45:37.658 --> 45:39.009
Now I gotta look over my shoulder

45:39.033 --> 45:40.242
for the rest of my life,

45:40.283 --> 45:41.367
because you messed up!

45:41.408 --> 45:43.158
Shut the hell up. Let me think.

45:54.325 --> 45:56.158
I'll make a call.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.718
Maybe the bureau can
make this disappear.

45:57.742 --> 45:58.843
Nah, this is a public place.

45:58.867 --> 46:00.575
Word will get out. It always does.

46:00.617 --> 46:02.742
And you had opiates in
your system last night, man.

46:05.658 --> 46:07.283
Everybody, stop!

46:11.658 --> 46:13.242
They're right, Byrd.

46:15.658 --> 46:17.117
You're screwed.

46:18.575 --> 46:20.450
And it's because you don't listen.

46:22.617 --> 46:25.367
But so are we.

46:25.408 --> 46:27.825
So right now, we need
each other. You understand?

46:33.283 --> 46:35.450
I need to know you understand.

46:53.825 --> 46:55.367
What are you gonna do with him?

47:07.117 --> 47:08.533
Make him disappear.
