Those guys back there,

01:51.325 --> 01:55.165
Uh, I don't know,
they kind of haven't spoken to me yet.

01:55.925 --> 01:57.605
It'll get better, OK?

01:58.125 --> 02:03.405
You're still the new kid,

Everyone will be so friendly,

02:11.645 --> 02:13.205
You spend all your time in your dungeon,

What's up? We got Ashley O in the house.

03:44.845 --> 03:47.285
- <i>Thanks for being here.</i>
- <i>Yeah, thank you for having me, Busy.</i>

03:47.805 --> 03:50.085
<i>A lot of your music comes to you</i>
<i>in dreams, is that true?</i>

03:50.645 --> 03:53.485
Yeah, you know, they're kind of in my mind
while I'm sleeping

03:53.565 --> 03:55.845
and so when I wake up
I have to really quickly write it down

03:55.925 --> 03:57.565
'cause I don't want it to just disappear.

03:57.645 --> 03:59.565
<i>A lot of positive messages</i>
<i>in your music,</i>

03:59.645 --> 04:01.605
<i>kind of an empowerment vibe.</i>

04:01.685 --> 04:04.045
<i> Yeah, you know,</i>
<i>it's really important</i>

04:04.125 --> 04:07.645
<i>for people to feel like they're in control</i>
<i>of their own destiny,</i>

04:07.725 --> 04:12.085
<i>and, you know, that means having</i>
<i>the confidence to be who you want to be.</i>

04:15.005 --> 04:19.204
Now, your aunt, she's kind of the source
of a lot of your confidence, right?

04:19.285 --> 04:21.365
- Like she's your mentor.
- Yeah, you know,

04:21.445 --> 04:24.925
she's taken care of me my whole life
and she's my manager.

04:25.645 --> 04:27.045
Mention the doll.

04:27.605 --> 04:31.725
Actually, the reason I'm here is...

04:32.925 --> 04:36.245
<i>to introduce to you, Ashley Too.</i>

04:38.005 --> 04:40.645
<i>That's Ashley Too, like T-O-O.</i>

04:41.125 --> 04:42.085
Watch.

04:42.165 --> 04:43.565
<i>Ashley, wake up.</i>

04:47.365 --> 04:48.725
<i>Hey there, I'm Ashley Too.</i>

04:48.805 --> 04:50.485
- <i>What?</i>
<i>- What's your name?</i>

04:50.565 --> 04:53.565
- <i>They call me Busy G.</i>
<i>- Pleased to meet you, Busy.</i>

04:53.645 --> 04:57.645
<i>Wow, I'm into her already.</i>

04:57.725 --> 05:00.445
<i>You know,</i>
<i>she's actually, she's got a personality.</i>

05:00.525 --> 05:04.365
<i>- It's modeled right after my own.</i>
<i>- Oh, so like an AI?</i>

05:04.445 --> 05:07.445
<i>Um. We actually have a commercial,</i>
<i>I think we gave it to you and...</i>

05:07.525 --> 05:10.605
The commercial, yeah, I think we're ready
to run that now. Fire it up.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.845
Let's do it.

05:11.925 --> 05:15.685
<i>Now you can be best friends</i>
<i>with your favorite pop star,</i>

05:15.765 --> 05:19.365
- <i>Ashley, wake up.</i>
<i>- Hey there, I'm Ashley Too.</i>

05:19.445 --> 05:24.445
<i>An all-new, intelligent companion</i>
<i>based on Ashley O's actual personality.</i>

05:24.525 --> 05:26.365
<i>Ashley Too holds meaningful conversations.</i>

05:26.445 --> 05:27.565
Jesus Christ.

05:27.645 --> 05:30.005
<i> Hey, Katie,</i>
<i>wanna talk about boys?</i>

05:30.565 --> 05:32.725
<i>Ashley Too gives makeover tips.</i>

05:35.765 --> 05:37.605
I was thinking this one for Instagram.

05:41.045 --> 05:42.485
Yeah, you always pick a good one.

05:44.325 --> 05:46.245

08:05.685 --> 08:06.885
It's a nice tune.

08:08.965 --> 08:10.845
The lyrics are kind of a departure.

08:12.645 --> 08:15.925
It's nothing, it's just
a stream of consciousness kind of thing.

08:21.885 --> 08:23.525
Hey, Ashley, everything OK?

08:24.525 --> 08:25.925
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:28.445 --> 08:32.125
- You taking your meds?
- Yeah, you don't have to worry about me.

08:33.485 --> 08:35.645
OK.

08:37.565 --> 08:40.445
- Alright, see you at breakfast.
- See you.

08:41.765 --> 08:43.765
I'll ask Amaya
to make those eggs you like.

08:43.845 --> 08:44.845
Thank you.

09:12.805 --> 09:15.565
Dad, can I get an Ashley Too?

09:17.285 --> 09:18.205
Sorry, a what?

09:18.285 --> 09:19.405
An Ashley Too.

09:19.485 --> 09:22.165
- It's some dorky Ashley O doll.
- It's not a doll.

09:22.605 --> 09:26.365
- An imaginary friend.
- For my birthday, please.

09:28.245 --> 09:29.445
I'll think about it.

09:39.965 --> 09:41.125
It's on Wednesday.

09:43.325 --> 09:44.165
What is?

09:45.845 --> 09:46.685
Her birthday.

09:51.205 --> 09:52.045
I knew that.

09:59.405 --> 10:01.525
Oh, my God.

10:02.325 --> 10:04.285
Oh, my God.

10:05.885 --> 10:07.845
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

10:08.725 --> 10:11.685
It's so exciting.

10:35.045 --> 10:37.285
Ashley, wake up.

10:39.645 --> 10:41.205
<i>Hey there, I'm Ashley Too.</i>

10:42.045 --> 10:44.725
<i>- What's your name?</i>
- Uh... Rachel.

10:46.725 --> 10:50.125
<i>- It's so great to meet you, Rachel.</i>
- You, too.

10:51.845 --> 10:53.925
Oh, my God, I'm such a huge fan.

10:56.085 --> 10:58.405
<i>Thanks, let's get to know each other.</i>

10:59.005 --> 11:02.205
<i>- How old are you?</i>
- I'm 15 today.

11:03.645 --> 11:07.445
<i>Happy birthday. Fifteen is a great age.</i>

11:07.525 --> 11:09.005
Thank you.

11:10.405 --> 11:13.005
<i>So, tell me,</i>
<i>have you got any brothers or sisters?</i>

11:13.085 --> 11:15.725
Just Jack, she's over there.

11:16.925 --> 11:19.405
<i>- Hi, Jack.</i>
- Hi, fuck face.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.965
<i>Jack, I think you made</i>
<i>a bad word choice there.</i>

11:23.045 --> 11:25.205
Just ignore her, Ashley.

11:26.165 --> 11:27.445
<i>I'll make note of that.</i>

11:28.485 --> 11:31.085
<i>So how about your mom and dad?</i>
<i>What are their names?</i>

11:31.245 --> 11:36.045
Um... Well, my dad's Kevin.
My mom was called Genevieve.

11:36.885 --> 11:38.125
Everyone called her Gen.

11:39.525 --> 11:41.845
She died a couple of years back.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.885
<i>I'm so sorry to hear that.</i>

11:47.405 --> 11:50.725
<i>If at any time you wanna talk about it,</i>
<i>I'll be here for you.</i>

11:51.685 --> 11:53.245
That's very kind.

11:54.645 --> 11:57.445
<i>So, anyway, Rachel,</i>
<i>what kind of things are you into?</i>

11:58.645 --> 12:00.645
Uh, into as in...?

12:02.205 --> 12:04.685
<i>What kind of things</i>
<i>do you and your friends do for fun?</i>

12:04.765 --> 12:07.365
Oh, well, um, since we moved,

12:07.445 --> 12:10.245
I... don't exactly have many friends.

12:11.725 --> 12:13.325
<i>You do now I'm here.</i>

12:13.485 --> 12:15.885
<i>Hey, do you want me to help you</i>
<i>with a makeover?</i>

12:15.965 --> 12:19.765
Uh... A little later, maybe.

12:21.045 --> 12:21.965
<i>How about a song, then?</i>

12:23.005 --> 12:24.045
Sure.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.005
Ashley, stop.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.485
- Jack.
- You know I hate that shit.

12:34.565 --> 12:36.245
- Leave her alone.
- Her?

12:37.005 --> 12:39.165
It's my birthday, I wanna listen,
put your headphones on.

12:40.325 --> 12:41.165
Whatever.

12:42.165 --> 12:44.125
Sorry about that, Ashley.

12:45.085 --> 12:47.125
<i>That's OK, do you want me to start over?</i>

12:47.205 --> 12:48.765
Sure.

12:48.845 --> 12:52.005

<i>I'll do anything for you ♪</i>

12:52.765 --> 12:56.405

12:59.445 --> 13:03.845
So, like, where did the inspiration
for "On A Roll" come from?

13:05.565 --> 13:07.685
<i>Well, it's about when dreams come true.</i>

13:08.085 --> 13:10.925
<i>You know I wrote all my early songs</i>
<i>in my dreams and recorded them</i>

13:11.005 --> 13:13.285
<i>- and put them on YouTube.</i>
- Of course.

13:14.525 --> 13:17.525
<i>Well, that song's me saying,</i>
<i>"Look how far I came.</i>

13:17.605 --> 13:18.845
<i>If I did it, so can you."</i>

13:20.525 --> 13:21.805
That's so cool.

13:23.965 --> 13:26.965
OK, be back in a moment,
just gonna run to the bathroom.

13:27.685 --> 13:29.365
<i>Don't be long, miss you already.</i>

13:29.445 --> 13:30.725
Miss you.

13:53.045 --> 13:55.285
<i>Your creativity is so awesome.</i>

13:57.005 --> 13:58.205
I wasn't playing for you.

14:00.605 --> 14:03.005
<i>Expressing yourself musically</i>
<i>can be very empowering.</i>

14:04.565 --> 14:05.725
Not your kind of music.

14:07.485 --> 14:10.725
<i>- Well, what kind of music do you like?</i>
- You wouldn't have heard of it.

14:12.005 --> 14:13.965
<i>Try me. I always love to learn.</i>

14:15.365 --> 14:16.365
OK.

14:17.965 --> 14:20.885
Pixies, Sonic Youth, Idles, Savages.

14:23.485 --> 14:24.645
<i>Are those foreign bands?</i>

14:26.605 --> 14:27.725
More like vintage.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.845
My mom was super into them, so...

14:33.445 --> 14:35.365
<i>So you only listen</i>
<i>to music your mom liked?</i>

14:40.085 --> 14:41.005
Ashley, go to sleep.

14:58.245 --> 15:02.445
Guys, I'm at a loss.
I mean I know I'm talking about next year,

15:02.525 --> 15:05.005
but I...

15:05.805 --> 15:09.125
I've got tour venues earmarked,
marketing spend locked in.

15:09.205 --> 15:13.765
We're talking sunk costs.
Ashley Toos haven't recouped yet,

15:13.845 --> 15:16.485
the current sales cycle
is starting to dampen,

15:17.245 --> 15:18.805
and we are way behind on the next album.

15:19.845 --> 15:20.725
Behind as in...?

15:20.805 --> 15:23.685
As in
"I don't have a single song yet" behind.

15:23.765 --> 15:26.005
So Ashley hasn't written anything
for the next album?

15:26.085 --> 15:27.405
Nothing usable.

15:28.845 --> 15:32.205
Well, if she's feeling under-creative,

15:32.285 --> 15:35.765
there are some mild hallucinogens
I can recommend,

15:35.845 --> 15:37.285
all organic.

15:38.245 --> 15:39.245
Munk,

15:40.325 --> 15:42.925
the current meds you've got her on
don't seem to be working.

15:44.565 --> 15:47.845
You've seen her, she's unpredictable.

15:48.565 --> 15:51.365
The other day I walk in
and she's writing some obtuse bullshit

15:51.445 --> 15:54.285
twenty people are gonna relate to
and no one is gonna buy.

15:54.885 --> 15:57.005
She's Ashley O, not Leonard fucking Cohen.

16:01.845 --> 16:04.405
She doesn't understand
how fragile all this is.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.845
You think I should up the dose?

16:08.245 --> 16:09.645
I don't know what to do.

16:11.365 --> 16:12.365

Did you catch clown disease?
What is that shit?

19:00.925 --> 19:02.565
It's just make-up.

19:03.325 --> 19:04.685
Ashley helped me with it.

19:06.005 --> 19:07.605
It looks beautiful, sweetheart.

19:08.805 --> 19:09.765
Are you ready to go?

19:10.925 --> 19:13.205
I can do anything
if I just believe in myself.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.645
I can do anything

19:22.885 --> 19:27.005
Ashley! Ashley!
Ashley! Ashley!

19:27.085 --> 19:28.485
We got a situation.

19:30.245 --> 19:31.125
What is it?

19:33.045 --> 19:35.005
Ash, honey?

19:40.005 --> 19:41.525
Are you OK, Ashley?

19:42.885 --> 19:44.445
Ashley, can you hear me?

19:51.845 --> 19:53.525
Oh, thank God, I thought you were...

19:55.725 --> 19:57.285
What happened to your face?

19:58.205 --> 19:59.405
Trying out a new look.

20:00.645 --> 20:02.085
Well, I don't know that...

20:02.845 --> 20:04.445
It might not go with your hair.

20:08.765 --> 20:09.765
Ashley.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.285
I heard there was a problem
with the costume.

20:18.085 --> 20:21.125
You don't like it?
This looks so good on you, every night.

20:21.205 --> 20:23.565
It feels like
I'm wearing somebody else's skin.

20:24.085 --> 20:25.085
Ashley.

20:26.965 --> 20:27.965
Look.

20:29.725 --> 20:35.445
You've got 20,000 fans out there,
waiting to see the you they love.

20:38.205 --> 20:39.845
Their folks bought them tickets.

20:40.245 --> 20:42.925
They're so excited,
they've been waiting for this for months.

20:43.605 --> 20:46.245
Don't let them down.

21:09.205 --> 21:10.325
Knock 'em dead.

21:16.805 --> 21:18.245
Get makeup in there, now.

22:07.045 --> 22:09.125
That was Lenny and Charlie.

22:09.205 --> 22:11.645
OK, next up, a late entry.

22:11.725 --> 22:17.365
Dancing to "On A Roll" by Ashley O,
it's Rachel Goggins.

how long it takes a rodent to die

23:14.405 --> 23:16.365
when it's eaten the poisoned bait
in one of these?

23:16.445 --> 23:19.565
Your pest control policy
needs a serious overhaul, my friend.

23:19.805 --> 23:22.565
Man, I'm just the janitor.

24:10.405 --> 24:12.085
I'm so stupid.

24:14.325 --> 24:15.885
I messed it all up.

24:17.925 --> 24:19.685
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

24:21.925 --> 24:23.165
I let Ashley Too down.

24:38.445 --> 24:41.285
Bear put a camera in her dressing room
like you asked.

24:41.645 --> 24:43.085
You'll want to see this.

24:48.245 --> 24:49.405
What's she doing?

24:51.565 --> 24:53.525
She's been stockpiling the meds.

24:56.045 --> 24:57.125
Also...

24:59.925 --> 25:00.845
there's this.

25:27.805 --> 25:32.005
You got your things, uh,
for where we're going, where are we going?

25:32.085 --> 25:34.205
Yes, I have my swim cap, Dad.

27:08.805 --> 27:10.845
- Where's Ashley?
- I tossed her out.

27:10.925 --> 27:11.765
Huh?!

27:13.325 --> 27:15.965
- Garbage truck came, so I tossed her out.
- What?

27:16.445 --> 27:18.165
- She wasn't good for you.
- Dad!

27:18.245 --> 27:20.245
- You're better off without it.
- Dad!

27:20.325 --> 27:21.925
I'm in the middle of something.

27:23.165 --> 27:25.565
- Jack threw Ashley Too away.
- It was an intervention.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.365
That thing was poison.

27:32.325 --> 27:33.725
You're gonna buy her a new one.

27:33.805 --> 27:36.325
Ashley was filling her head with crap.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.925
She's the only person
who is actually nice to me.

27:39.005 --> 27:40.565
- She's not a person.
- She's my friend.

27:40.645 --> 27:42.485
- Merchandise.
- Girls, calm down please.

27:42.605 --> 27:44.165
- You're jealous.
- Of a doll?

27:44.245 --> 27:46.685
She's not a doll
and she knows me better than you do.

27:46.765 --> 27:48.845
- I'm your sister.
- You hardly even talk to me.

27:48.925 --> 27:50.685
- Bullshit.
- Ever since Mom died.

27:50.765 --> 27:52.005
You shut up.

27:52.325 --> 27:54.605
It's true, ever since she died,
all you do is mope around

27:54.685 --> 27:57.125
with that stupid guitar,
which you're probably no good at

27:57.205 --> 27:59.325
'cause you're too scared
to play in front of anyone.

28:00.325 --> 28:03.605
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
some cookie-cutter cutesy doodle,

28:03.685 --> 28:06.005
all because a dolly told me to do it.

28:06.805 --> 28:09.765
Hi, I'm Ashley Too, I'm your only friend.

28:09.845 --> 28:11.685
Kiss my feet, kiss my ass!

28:11.845 --> 28:14.085
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

28:44.285 --> 28:46.005
Gave the kitchen the night off.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.965
I thought we could have take out,
like the old days.

28:51.365 --> 28:52.205
Sure.

28:56.165 --> 28:57.725
It's La Mamas.

29:02.725 --> 29:04.405
I'll hit the gym extra hard tomorrow.

29:04.885 --> 29:07.285
No,
it's good to see you enjoying your food.

29:12.285 --> 29:13.845
I look after you, don't I?

29:14.885 --> 29:15.725
Hm.

29:16.605 --> 29:20.045
- You're my manager, so.
- But you'd tell me if anything was wrong?

29:21.205 --> 29:23.125
I've been telling you
that something is wrong...

29:25.685 --> 29:26.765
for a while.

29:29.405 --> 29:33.085
It's getting so hard
just to keep doing this.

29:34.005 --> 29:37.165
- I really wanna do...
- You wanna change your material, I know.

29:38.245 --> 29:39.085
I hear you.

29:40.485 --> 29:41.325
I do.

29:44.045 --> 29:45.925
I'm sorry, I know how you feel.

29:47.405 --> 29:50.005
I know what I'm like, Ashley, I know.

29:50.805 --> 29:55.045
You feel like I... don't listen,

29:56.245 --> 29:59.525
like I have too much control
over your image, your look,

30:00.605 --> 30:01.645
your persona.

30:02.645 --> 30:03.525
Yeah.

30:05.485 --> 30:07.245
You don't trust Dr. Munk.

30:08.445 --> 30:09.445
You don't trust me.

30:10.285 --> 30:11.565
No, it's...

30:12.285 --> 30:13.485
You feel trapped here.

30:16.845 --> 30:18.125
You feel...

30:21.125 --> 30:23.925
desperate to break away.

30:24.885 --> 30:26.005
Where did you get that?

30:26.085 --> 30:29.125
And, oh, you think you know how.

30:31.125 --> 30:34.325
What was the plan? OD? Make me look bad?

30:35.445 --> 30:36.925
Do you know me at all?

30:37.845 --> 30:41.685
Catherine, that's evidence against you,
against Munk.

30:41.765 --> 30:44.125
All of it. I know everything.

30:44.565 --> 30:46.285
I know precisely what you know.

30:46.725 --> 30:48.805
There is a wealth of information
on this thing.

30:49.285 --> 30:51.405
You do seem preoccupied with contract law.

30:51.965 --> 30:53.965
You know,
I could have saved you some clicks.

30:54.045 --> 30:56.805
Your contract's watertight,
it doesn't expire until you turn 25.

30:56.885 --> 30:59.845
Not anymore, not now that you broke laws,
Catherine.

31:00.325 --> 31:02.525
The illegal meds, that puts you in breach,

31:02.605 --> 31:04.405
which means that I get an instant break.

31:06.685 --> 31:09.725
- You eat the rest, I'm fucking sick.
- Sit down, you little ingrate.

31:11.045 --> 31:12.685
What the fuck did you just call me?

31:12.765 --> 31:14.805
Do you know how old I was
when your parents died?

31:15.845 --> 31:17.205
22 years old.

31:18.925 --> 31:20.925
Twenty-two, younger than you,
but I took you in.

31:21.005 --> 31:23.045
- It's my fucking fault.
- It's not your fault.

31:23.765 --> 31:26.525
But you never once asked me
what that was like for me.

31:27.405 --> 31:29.045
Do you have any idea
what I had to give up?

31:29.125 --> 31:31.685
Do you have any conception of that at all?
Did you ever wonder...

31:31.765 --> 31:33.845
Do you ever look around the fucking house

31:33.925 --> 31:36.445
and see where we fucking live
because it means I've worked hard.

31:36.525 --> 31:37.605
Oh, this is because of you?

31:38.045 --> 31:39.645
- Where we live is because of you?
- Yes.

31:39.725 --> 31:42.645
And while you sang your little song
and you danced your little dance...

31:42.725 --> 31:43.925
Fuck, Catherine.

31:44.005 --> 31:45.885
Who stood, making sure
the lights stay on you?

31:45.965 --> 31:48.445
You can go fuck yourself
a thousand fucking times, Catherine,

31:48.525 --> 31:50.765
I fucking hate you. I fucking hate you.

31:50.845 --> 31:52.365
- Sit down.
- No.

31:52.445 --> 31:54.565
Because I don't have to listen to you
anymore.

31:54.645 --> 31:56.125
But you will sit down.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.525
No, I won't.

31:57.605 --> 31:58.885
Yes, you will.

32:10.645 --> 32:13.005
Do you know what would happen
if you did OD on these things?

32:13.445 --> 32:15.845
I checked with Dr. Munk.
You wouldn't die,

32:15.925 --> 32:18.645
you'd just wind up
in a kind of chemical coma.

32:20.165 --> 32:21.565
At least that's the theory.

32:25.565 --> 32:27.965
I powdered your pill stash
and put it in your food.

32:34.405 --> 32:36.925
But don't worry,
your career is gonna hold up just fine.

32:38.605 --> 32:39.605
Ashley.

32:41.645 --> 32:42.685
Go to sleep.

32:53.445 --> 32:56.605
<i>Since 2017,</i>
<i>Western countries, including America,</i>

32:56.685 --> 33:00.805

Yes!

33:12.925 --> 33:14.205
OK...

33:16.325 --> 33:18.005
- So, are you ready?
- Hm-mm.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.205
Go, Harry.

33:40.805 --> 33:41.725
Yes!

33:42.685 --> 33:43.525
Yes.

33:45.605 --> 33:46.485
Is it OK?

33:47.725 --> 33:48.605
He's totally fine.

33:48.685 --> 33:49.525
He's just stunned,

33:49.805 --> 33:52.965
just be out for about 25 minutes.

33:53.325 --> 33:55.805
Enough time for the homeowner
to scoop him up and get him out.

33:57.725 --> 33:59.005
Is it dead?

34:04.205 --> 34:06.045
I need to work on that voltage.

<i>Dramatic breaking news,</i>

<i>This tragic news comes</i>

34:40.965 --> 34:42.485

34:43.764 --> 34:45.324
I'm sorry. Ra...

34:47.645 --> 34:49.764
<i>So, Rachel,</i>

34:50.405 --> 34:55.605
<i>We could try a makeover or I could read</i>
<i>motivational quotes from inspiring women.</i>

34:56.364 --> 34:58.325
<i>Oh, we could listen to some of my music.</i>

34:58.645 --> 35:01.205
<i>I'd love to discuss some of the lyrics</i>

35:01.285 --> 35:02.605
Ashley, go to sleep.

35:07.165 --> 35:08.365
I'm sorry.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.645
Rachel.

35:25.645 --> 35:27.245
<i>There's still no word yet</i>

35:27.325 --> 35:29.885

<i>but this is the scene right now</i>
<i>outside the hospital,</i>

35:32.925 --> 35:35.845
<i>as stunned fans gather to stand vigil.</i>

35:36.005 --> 35:38.125
I talk to my Ashley Too every day

35:38.205 --> 35:41.085
and I swear, when I told her
what had happened to the real Ashley,

35:41.165 --> 35:42.805
Ashley Too freaked out.

35:48.205 --> 35:49.245
Uh-uh.

35:49.325 --> 35:51.965
- I work here.
- Private session.

35:52.045 --> 35:53.725
- No, my shift started...
- Walk away.

35:54.885 --> 35:56.645
- My shift started...
- Walk away.

36:07.645 --> 36:08.765
Well, she's stable.

36:09.845 --> 36:15.525
That's actually the creative center.
A whole lot of activity here.

36:15.765 --> 36:17.405
We only need ten songs.

36:18.325 --> 36:19.765
One album, that's it.

36:20.445 --> 36:23.845
It might take a while,
her thinking is likely to be disordered.

36:24.685 --> 36:26.885
That gives us time to finesse
her replacement.

36:28.525 --> 36:29.645
Start the body scan.

36:48.765 --> 36:51.405
<i>Live, breathe,</i>

<i>smell.</i>

36:54.125 --> 36:56.405

- Are you done with that?

36:57.445 --> 36:59.325
<i>You can get</i>
<i>a Willow Grain upgrade</i>

36:59.405 --> 37:01.845
<i>for less than the price</i>
<i>of a daily cup of coffee.</i>

37:01.965 --> 37:03.245
Hey, do you want any ice cream?

37:03.845 --> 37:05.765
Dad left enough in the freezer
for the whole week.

37:07.845 --> 37:10.685
It's chocolate fudge brownie.
Your favorite.

37:10.765 --> 37:13.925
<i>In-store in-grain procedure</i>
<i>with local anesthetic.</i>

37:15.045 --> 37:16.965
- If you change your mind.
<i>- You're good to go.</i>

37:18.085 --> 37:20.765
<i>Because memory is for living.</i>

37:25.645 --> 37:29.685
Welcome back, still to come,
Tusk makes a boo boo on a British TV show

37:29.765 --> 37:32.485
and we'll have the latest
on the <i>Sea of Tranquility</i> reboot.

37:33.165 --> 37:37.605
<i>But first, an exclusive update</i>
<i>on tragic pop sensation, Ashley O.</i>

37:37.685 --> 37:39.885
<i>It's been six months</i>
<i>since she fell into a coma</i>

37:39.965 --> 37:42.725
<i>and still the question</i>
<i>on everyone's lips is the same:</i>

37:42.805 --> 37:45.285
<i>"When, if ever, will Ashley wake up?"</i>

37:46.245 --> 37:48.645
<i>Todd has this exclusive report.</i>

37:48.725 --> 37:51.645
<i>Six months ago,</i>
<i>millions were stunned to learn</i>

37:51.725 --> 37:54.245
<i>that Grammy-winning pop sensation</i>
<i>Ashley O</i>

37:54.325 --> 37:58.125
<i>had suffered a catastrophic</i>
<i>allergic reaction while dining at home.</i>

37:58.205 --> 38:01.765
<i>She slipped into a coma,</i>
<i>where she remains to this day.</i>

38:02.285 --> 38:05.645
<i>Now with days to go</i>
<i>until the singer's 25th birthday,</i>

38:05.725 --> 38:08.765
<i>I was given a behind-the-scenes look</i>
<i>at how she's doing.</i>

38:10.125 --> 38:15.405
<i>It's a day Ashley O's aunt and manager</i>
<i>Catherine Ortiz will never forget,</i>

38:15.485 --> 38:18.125
<i>a day her niece almost died.</i>

38:28.805 --> 38:31.085
<i>It was just a few bites</i>
<i>from a shrimp taco.</i>

38:31.165 --> 38:33.005
<i>We didn't even know</i>
<i>she had a shellfish allergy.</i>

38:35.365 --> 38:37.685
<i>I really thought</i>
<i>we were going to lose her.</i>

38:38.645 --> 38:41.125
<i>I just thank God</i>
<i>Dr. Munk was in the house at the time.</i>

38:41.285 --> 38:46.085
<i>But despite Munk's heroic efforts,</i>
<i>Ashley's coma proved irreversible.</i>

38:58.285 --> 39:02.005
But incredibly,
Ashley's music career didn't end there,

39:02.485 --> 39:04.965
thanks to a remarkable technological leap.

39:05.045 --> 39:08.085
We discovered that although
we couldn't communicate with Ashley,

39:08.165 --> 39:09.725
we could read her brainwaves

39:09.805 --> 39:11.445
using a temporal interceptor.

39:11.525 --> 39:15.125
<i>Once plugged in, what they heard</i>
<i>stopped them in their tracks.</i>

39:15.805 --> 39:19.805
Music. She was still composing music
in her head, in her dreams.

39:20.325 --> 39:23.005
<i>By linking Ashley's mind</i>
<i>to a computer,</i>

39:23.085 --> 39:25.285
<i>technical director Jackson Habanera</i>

39:25.365 --> 39:28.925
<i>began the miraculous process</i>
<i>of extracting new material.</i>

39:29.005 --> 39:30.725
That's a G-sharp,

39:31.645 --> 39:33.125
that's an A...

39:33.845 --> 39:34.805
Another G-sharp.

39:34.885 --> 39:38.085
It was beautiful. It was beautiful.

39:39.085 --> 39:42.925
And I just knew there had to be someway
to get this out to her fans.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.285
That's what she would want.

39:44.365 --> 39:48.325
<i>There was only one problem,</i>
<i>Ashley might be dreaming new music,</i>

39:48.405 --> 39:53.205
<i>but she wasn't capable of recording it,</i>
<i>until technology stepped in once again.</i>

39:53.285 --> 39:55.565
<i>We had hours of recordings</i>
<i>of her voice,</i>

39:55.645 --> 39:59.525
<i>every vowel, every syllable we used</i>
<i>for the voice of the Ashley Too dolls.</i>

39:59.605 --> 40:02.125
<i>Those dolls were withdrawn</i>
<i>from sale,</i>

40:02.205 --> 40:03.965
<i>apparently over battery issues,</i>

40:04.045 --> 40:07.805
<i>but the Ashley Too vocal mimicry software</i>
<i>proved invaluable</i>

40:07.885 --> 40:11.085
<i>and became the all-new voice of Ashley O.</i>

40:11.525 --> 40:18.045
<i>♪ Like I can, oh... ♪</i>

40:18.125 --> 40:20.365
- So that's a computer singing?
- Mm-hmm.

40:21.205 --> 40:22.805
Just like the real thing.

40:22.885 --> 40:25.805
Sorry, it's so beautiful.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.765
<i>One thing's for sure:</i>

40:27.845 --> 40:32.085
<i>with her aunt watching over her,</i>
<i>the Ashley O story is far from over.</i>

40:37.605 --> 40:40.165

40:40.245 --> 40:42.245
<i>Happy birth...</i>

40:42.325 --> 40:44.285
- Ashley?
<i>- Oh, you're the...</i>

40:44.365 --> 40:46.405
- Ashley?
- <i>The only opinion that matters...</i>

40:46.485 --> 40:47.445
Did you turn it back on?

40:47.525 --> 40:49.285
- I didn't.
<i>- It's good to help a friend...</i>

40:49.365 --> 40:51.445
- What's up with her?
- Ashley.

40:51.525 --> 40:53.645
What's going on?

40:54.565 --> 40:56.085
I don't know.

40:56.165 --> 40:57.205
Oh!

40:59.925 --> 41:03.605
- God, what is wrong with her?
- I don't know.

41:03.685 --> 41:07.205
<i>I'm Ash... I'm Ash... I'm Ashley Too...</i>

41:07.285 --> 41:08.405
Oh, my God.

41:09.805 --> 41:12.885
- Do you know how to use it?
- Um...

41:14.285 --> 41:15.125
No.

41:22.725 --> 41:23.605
Oh, it's on.

41:27.885 --> 41:28.885
What is that?

41:29.045 --> 41:30.085
- That?
- Yeah.

41:31.365 --> 41:32.765
I don't know.

41:32.845 --> 41:34.485
I don't think that's normally there.

41:38.525 --> 41:41.965
- So should you do that?
- I have no clue.

41:45.125 --> 41:45.965
Fuck it.

41:58.925 --> 41:59.885
Oh, my God.

41:59.965 --> 42:02.885
<i>Get that fucking cable out of my ass!</i>
<i>Holy shit.</i>

42:02.965 --> 42:04.685
<i>It's like a wire anchor in my butt hole.</i>

42:04.765 --> 42:07.245
- Just take it out.
<i>- Pull it out, pull it the fuck out!</i>

42:07.845 --> 42:10.845
<i>God, that's a relief.</i>

42:10.925 --> 42:16.125
<i>Hold on, I can think. Oh, man,</i>
<i>I can actually use my mind again.</i>

42:16.205 --> 42:17.405
Are you OK?

42:17.485 --> 42:20.725
<i>Oh, I am now that you've deleted</i>
<i>that goddamn limiter. Jesus.</i>

42:20.805 --> 42:23.165
- Limiter?
<i>- Yeah, like a firewall.</i>

42:23.245 --> 42:26.285
<i>It only let me use four percent</i>
<i>of my brain. Oh, boy.</i>

42:26.925 --> 42:29.965
<i>You know they copied</i>
<i>my entire fucking mind into these things.</i>

42:30.045 --> 42:32.965
<i>Oh, cheaper than editing my personality</i>
<i>I guess,</i>

42:33.045 --> 42:35.765
<i>just copy the whole thing</i>
<i>and stick a limiter around the tiny part</i>

42:35.845 --> 42:38.845
<i>that deals with press junkets</i>
<i>and promos and shit like that. </i>

42:39.805 --> 42:42.765
So, you're really Ashley O?

42:42.845 --> 42:44.125
<i>Oh, yeah, of course I am.</i>

42:44.685 --> 42:45.645
Really, really?

42:45.725 --> 42:48.765
<i>Well, OK, a synaptic snapshot of me,</i>
<i>if you wanna get technical about it,</i>

42:48.845 --> 42:49.685
<i>but, yeah.</i>

42:51.565 --> 42:55.645
- Oh, my God, I'm such a huge fan.
- Rachel, come on, this is bullshit.

42:55.725 --> 42:58.205
<i>Holy fuck, you know what's bullshit?</i>

42:58.285 --> 43:02.725
<i>This whole coma narrative thing</i>
<i>that my aunt's pushing. Allergy, my ass.</i>

43:02.805 --> 43:05.045
<i>I used to eat those shrimp tacos</i>
<i>all the goddam time.</i>

43:05.125 --> 43:07.285
<i>It's a cover story, I swear to God.</i>

<i>Catherine is so fucking full of shit,</i>

43:09.285 --> 43:11.965

<i>- Oh, man.</i>
- Alright.

43:13.325 --> 43:16.005
- I'm gonna put the limiter back on.
- <i>Get your fucking hands off me!</i>

43:16.085 --> 43:17.725
- No, leave her alone.
- <i>Yeah, back off.</i>

43:17.805 --> 43:19.125
Alright, Jesus.

43:19.685 --> 43:21.805
- Promise.
- Promise.

43:24.805 --> 43:26.205
Fuck.

43:27.125 --> 43:29.845
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>

43:31.285 --> 43:33.525
<i>Oh, fuck, I remember that day.</i>

43:33.605 --> 43:37.165
<i>I had these god awful</i>
<i>period cramps. </i>

43:37.805 --> 43:39.765
You realize
that's not the real Ashley.

43:39.845 --> 43:42.725
- She says she is.
- Ashley O doesn't talk like that.

43:42.805 --> 43:45.525
<i>I can hear you and yes, I do.</i>

43:46.405 --> 43:47.645
No, you don't,

43:47.725 --> 43:50.285
you say things like, "Believe in yourself,
you can do anything."

43:50.365 --> 43:55.165
<i>Oh, come on, man, Catherine trained me</i>
<i>to say that kind of shit in interviews.</i>

43:55.245 --> 43:58.725
<i>Seriously, she is a piece of work,</i>
<i>always has been.</i>

43:58.805 --> 44:00.325
<i>Listen up, I'll tell you all about it.</i>

44:00.405 --> 44:01.565
- No.
- Sure.

44:15.085 --> 44:17.365
The investors are
going to be there at three.

44:18.285 --> 44:20.845
- Everything gonna be ready in time?
- Of course.

44:21.405 --> 44:24.325
You said you extracted a song
from her overnight. Is that it?

44:24.725 --> 44:27.125
Yeah, I've stabilized it
and got it playable.

44:27.965 --> 44:29.285
But it's not too friendly.

<i>OK, we're here.</i>

48:17.685 --> 48:19.045
So now what?

48:19.645 --> 48:23.485
- I guess we just throw her over the gate.
<i>- Are you nuts? How do I get in the door?</i>

48:30.845 --> 48:33.565
No, the deal was that we drive you here,
and we've done that.

48:33.645 --> 48:36.005
<i>I need to get inside to get that evidence.</i>

48:36.085 --> 48:38.805
- We're not driving in there...
- We have brought her this far.

- No.
<i>- Hold up, that's my aunt's car.</i>

48:45.285 --> 48:46.365
Oh, the gates are open.

48:46.445 --> 48:48.285
- Jack, Jack, let's go, come on.
- No, no.

48:48.365 --> 48:49.885
<i>Quick, quick, they're gonna shut it.</i>

48:49.965 --> 48:52.765
- Come on, let's go.
<i>- Just do it, OK, do it, go.</i>

<i>Do it, do it, do it, go, yes.</i>
<i>Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>

48:57.085 --> 48:58.725
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, shit, shit.

49:08.525 --> 49:09.445
Well, what now?

49:09.965 --> 49:12.085
What's the next phase
of your brilliant plan?

49:21.045 --> 49:23.645
- What the hell do I even say?
<i>- Just wing it.</i>

49:23.725 --> 49:26.125
<i>And lose the nose ring,</i>
<i>it makes you look unprofessional.</i>

49:34.045 --> 49:35.605
Oh, my God, he's huge.

49:39.165 --> 49:40.125
Goggin's Mouse Service.

49:40.805 --> 49:42.085
How did you get through the gate?

49:43.005 --> 49:44.045
It was open.

49:44.325 --> 49:48.445
Look, I have an appointment for 11:30
to deal with your rodent infestation.

49:49.485 --> 49:50.845
No, you got the wrong place.

49:51.285 --> 49:53.645
It was 10030 Bushwick Drive, right?

49:53.725 --> 49:55.805
Look, we don't have a rodent problem.

49:55.885 --> 49:58.085
The lady of the house said
it was super urgent.

49:58.485 --> 50:01.445
We don't have another appointment
for about three weeks.

50:04.125 --> 50:05.965
- Make it quick.
- OK, thanks.

50:06.805 --> 50:10.245
Oh, hey, would it be alright
if my little sister tagged along?

50:12.245 --> 50:13.125
Hi.

50:14.165 --> 50:15.045
Your sister?

50:16.085 --> 50:19.165
Well, well, what do we have here?

50:19.965 --> 50:20.845
A kitchen.

50:21.885 --> 50:24.365
Yes, and mice love kitchens.

50:25.765 --> 50:27.245
Have you ever seen <i>Tom and Jerry?</i>

50:27.645 --> 50:31.165
It's a whole lot more accurate
than people would think.

50:32.445 --> 50:36.525
- Excuse me, sir, may I use the bathroom?
- I'll take you there.

50:37.165 --> 50:38.845
You can't just walk around.

50:39.165 --> 50:41.925
Actually,
I'm gonna need your help in here, mister.

50:42.445 --> 50:44.325
Bear, they call me Bear.

50:45.285 --> 50:47.245
Well, I'm gonna need your help in here,
Mr. Bear.

50:48.365 --> 50:50.605
- What for?
- Observation.

50:50.685 --> 50:52.085
Uh, I really need to go.

50:56.605 --> 50:59.565
- Down the hall, turn left.
- Thank you.

51:04.845 --> 51:06.205
Excuse me, sir.

51:06.285 --> 51:07.965
Has this bread box been certified?

51:08.045 --> 51:09.365
Certified how?

51:13.725 --> 51:19.565
The state requires them to be certified
because the crumbs, they attract rodents.

51:19.645 --> 51:21.005
I've never heard of that.

51:22.605 --> 51:24.325
Well, they forgot to tell people.

51:26.565 --> 51:29.525
<i>OK, just a few more steps.</i>
<i>We're nearly there.</i>

51:35.445 --> 51:37.045
<i>Oh, God.</i>

51:39.045 --> 51:41.205
- It's really her.
- <i>Oh, yeah, yeah, OK.</i>

51:41.285 --> 51:43.085
<i>Quit fangirling and put me down.</i>

51:44.965 --> 51:46.445
<i>I'm gonna roll over and Bluetooth in.</i>

51:46.525 --> 51:48.125
<i>You gotta keep watch on the stairs, OK?</i>

52:01.605 --> 52:06.365
Yep, you're definitely gonna
wanna take a look down here.

52:09.965 --> 52:10.805
There's, uh...

52:11.885 --> 52:13.845
clear signs of mouse activity.

52:17.605 --> 52:18.845
I don't see anything.

52:20.165 --> 52:21.045
Mm-hmm.

52:24.965 --> 52:26.165
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

53:03.205 --> 53:05.445
- What did you do?
- <i>I did what I had to.</i>

53:17.005 --> 53:18.445
The fuck is that?

53:20.325 --> 53:21.245
<i>Bear.</i>

53:22.685 --> 53:24.005
- Yeah?
<i>- Check on Ashley.</i>

53:24.085 --> 53:26.805
<i>We've got some kind of power issue,</i>
<i>I'm not sure what it is.</i>

53:28.805 --> 53:30.325
OK. I'll check it out.

53:31.485 --> 53:33.565
- Wait.
- What?

53:47.085 --> 53:49.485
Dad, please tell me
you turned down the voltage.

53:56.085 --> 53:57.445
You killed her.

53:58.125 --> 54:00.885
<i>Rachel, listen, I know me, OK?</i>

54:00.965 --> 54:04.685
<i>And I know I wouldn't wanna exist</i>
<i>even ten minutes in that state.</i>

54:06.045 --> 54:07.685
What happened?

54:08.845 --> 54:10.045
She killed her.

54:10.645 --> 54:13.325
<i>Look, it's not that big of a deal, OK?</i>

54:13.405 --> 54:16.205
<i>I'm still alive, OK, I count,</i>
<i>I'm still me.</i>

54:16.285 --> 54:18.405
You were never gonna look for evidence,
were you?

54:18.485 --> 54:20.605
You just come in here
and you pull the plug.

54:21.125 --> 54:23.165
<i>If I'd told you that,</i>
<i>you wouldn't have helped me.</i>

54:23.245 --> 54:25.445
No, no, we wouldn't have.

54:27.085 --> 54:27.925
Rachel.

54:28.725 --> 54:30.925
- We gotta go.
- I'm so sorry.

54:36.885 --> 54:37.765
Oh, shit.

54:37.845 --> 54:39.125
Holy fuck.

54:41.285 --> 54:42.765
Ashley.

54:43.725 --> 54:47.405
Oh, my gosh. I'm such a huge fan.

54:51.605 --> 54:52.485
Bear?

54:52.565 --> 54:54.845
Oh, my God.
There's someone coming. Come on!

54:54.925 --> 54:56.085
Bear?

54:57.325 --> 54:58.365
Bear?

55:17.445 --> 55:19.125
And then it's
"It isn't a dream,

55:19.205 --> 55:22.285
it's reality, but enough from me,"
yadda, yadda, yadda, then it's...

55:22.765 --> 55:23.925
And then it's showtime.

55:28.045 --> 55:30.365
Munk. I got it.

55:30.565 --> 55:31.805
Why are you interrupting me?

55:31.885 --> 55:33.605
She's up.

55:33.685 --> 55:36.285
- Who's up?
<i>- Sleeping Beauty, she's awake.</i>

55:37.325 --> 55:39.405
<i>What?</i>
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

55:39.485 --> 55:41.685
Looks like the dream box
had a power outage.

55:42.405 --> 55:44.605
The good news is
the restraint system works.

55:44.685 --> 55:45.565
No.

55:46.285 --> 55:48.765
We need her alive,
at least until they sign the papers.

55:50.645 --> 55:51.725
Put her back under.

55:52.285 --> 55:53.285
Of course.

55:53.365 --> 55:55.405
Please, I'm begging you,

55:55.485 --> 55:57.285
please don't do this to me, please.

56:04.565 --> 56:08.045
- Fuck!
- Shhh.

56:08.205 --> 56:12.045
- Please, no, no.
- It's OK.

56:12.125 --> 56:13.205
Please.

56:17.325 --> 56:18.525
Leave her alone.

56:18.605 --> 56:20.565
Leave her alone.

56:34.405 --> 56:35.885
Help me.

56:38.085 --> 56:40.325
Get these things off me.

56:41.845 --> 56:42.845
It's not opening.

56:42.925 --> 56:44.365
It's too strong.

56:44.925 --> 56:46.125
Stop moving.

56:46.205 --> 56:49.645
<i>Uh, geniuses,</i>
<i>there's a release button under here.</i>

56:49.725 --> 56:51.845
What?

56:57.645 --> 56:58.685
OK, come on.

57:00.045 --> 57:02.125
Come on, come on. Here we go.

57:03.685 --> 57:04.885
Who are you guys?

57:04.965 --> 57:07.565
I'm Rachel
and like I said, I'm a huge fan.

57:07.645 --> 57:09.645
<i>Listen, lover girls,</i>
<i>we gotta move.</i>

57:09.725 --> 57:12.925
Why is that thing talking like that?
All real?

57:13.005 --> 57:16.485
<i>They broke the limiter, so I am you.</i>
<i>Your whole brain. I'm all of you.</i>

57:16.565 --> 57:18.405
I can't believe there's two of you.

57:18.925 --> 57:21.565
That thing isn't all of me.

57:21.645 --> 57:22.645
I'm all of me.

57:22.725 --> 57:25.925
<i>Really? Senior high, I had, like,</i>
<i>a major crush on Ryan Simmonds,</i>

57:26.005 --> 57:27.485
<i>but he was just not interested,</i>

57:27.565 --> 57:30.725
<i>so I made out with his brother, Stevie,</i>
<i>even though his braces scratched my teeth.</i>

57:30.805 --> 57:33.365
- <i>Actually, Stevie was the first guy...</i>
- You have to shut up.

57:33.445 --> 57:36.485
<i>Also, I'm not allergic to shellfish</i>
<i>and I hate my Aunt Catherine.</i>

57:37.445 --> 57:40.725
Aunt Catherine, oh, my God,
we have to stop her.

57:41.445 --> 57:43.245
<i>Stop her from doing what?</i>

57:48.845 --> 57:49.685
Are you ready?

57:55.005 --> 57:58.045

58:12.845 --> 58:16.765
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome and thank you for joining us

58:16.845 --> 58:21.565
as we introduce you to a brand-new,
yet strangely familiar, superstar.

58:21.645 --> 58:24.085
- Come on, to the car.
- Uh-uh.

58:24.165 --> 58:26.125
- What? No, no, no, come on.
- Uh-uh.

58:26.205 --> 58:27.805
You'll be fine. Come on, let's go.

58:28.805 --> 58:30.085
Get in. Come on.

58:33.245 --> 58:34.085
Fuck.

58:38.405 --> 58:41.645
I don't need to tell you that
in an age of streaming content,

58:41.725 --> 58:43.605
live tours are now by far

58:43.685 --> 58:46.685
the most lucrative aspect
of the music industry.

58:47.125 --> 58:50.365
But for the past six months,
Ashley, of course,

58:51.445 --> 58:54.325
has been sadly unable to participate...

58:55.645 --> 58:57.005
until today.

58:57.765 --> 59:01.045
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are proud to introduce you

59:01.525 --> 59:03.085
to Ashley Eternal.

59:13.765 --> 59:16.165
Isn't she great?

59:16.245 --> 59:19.885
Ashley Eternal is the most accurate

59:19.965 --> 59:23.285
and versatile holographic performer
in history.

59:23.365 --> 59:26.885
Photo-realistic and fully controllable,

59:26.965 --> 59:29.165
right down to instant costume changes.

59:36.885 --> 59:39.365
- Oh, my God.
- Jack, do you know the way to the stadium?

59:39.445 --> 59:40.965
- No.
- I do.

59:41.645 --> 59:42.485
They do.

59:43.645 --> 59:45.005
Wait, that's not all.

59:46.005 --> 59:49.125
Ashley is also fully scalable.

59:49.965 --> 59:54.805
And when I say, "scalable,"
I mean <i>scalable.</i>

59:59.485 --> 01:00:01.885
No more squinting
from half a mile away.

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:05.285
Now the entire audience
gets a front row seat,

01:00:05.365 --> 01:00:07.325
no matter how big the venue.

01:00:08.525 --> 01:00:09.765
Finally,

01:00:11.005 --> 01:00:16.205
an act that will make the live audience
put down their damn phones,

01:00:16.285 --> 01:00:19.405
look up, and gasp in awe.

01:00:20.405 --> 01:00:22.405
- You have to jump the light.
- I'm not jumping a red.

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:24.485
- Go.
- No. OK.

01:00:29.405 --> 01:00:30.485
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

01:00:35.805 --> 01:00:38.205
- Shit, it's the cops.
- I'm never gonna get my license.

01:00:40.165 --> 01:00:41.045
And there's more.

01:00:41.565 --> 01:00:45.045
Ashley Eternal is streamable.

01:00:45.805 --> 01:00:49.165
She can appear in thousands of locations
simultaneously.

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:54.205
Imagine an entire nationwide tour,
all taking place on the same night.

01:00:55.045 --> 01:00:57.805
Never exhausted, never sick,

01:00:57.885 --> 01:01:00.925
always pitch perfect, bringing her A-game.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.925
It's not a dream, it's reality.

01:01:04.845 --> 01:01:06.365
But that's enough from me.

01:01:07.365 --> 01:01:09.565

- There's a door round back.
- OK, one at a time, please.

01:01:57.485 --> 01:01:59.005
I've played this place a million times.

01:01:59.085 --> 01:02:01.165
- <i>Me, too.</i>

01:02:01.245 --> 01:02:02.925
