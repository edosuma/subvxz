[woman] Photons from
the visible spectrum are manipulated,

01:14.074 --> 01:16.534
creating a quantum storage network.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.120
It's the most advanced
storage system available.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.914
Actually, the Galaxy Garrison
is performing tests

01:20.997 --> 01:23.625
using DNA helixes as storage.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.503
That's the same way genetic information
is stored in our bodies.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.214
Nerd.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.424
[students laughing]

01:38.515 --> 01:39.933
[Pidge grunts]

01:49.025 --> 01:50.401
Hey, Pidge?

01:50.485 --> 01:52.445
I hate it when you call me that.

01:52.529 --> 01:56.491
Sorry, Katie.
Mom told me what happened today.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.619
I know what it's like to be the nerd.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.746
But you've got to keep studying hard.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.081
What's the point?

02:03.706 --> 02:08.252
Well... it was my brain
that got me into the Galaxy Garrison.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.506
[gasps]
You got in? Yes!

02:12.257 --> 02:13.716
I guess it was my brains.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.427
Could have been my good looks
or my big muscles.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.096
[giggles]

02:18.179 --> 02:21.015
That's amazing! Oh, man! I'm so excited.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.727
-What are you doing?
-Studying.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.814
So I can get into the Garrison
with you and Dad.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.700
<span style="style.default_1">Pidge, I don't like the idea</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of you going alone.</span>

02:38.783 --> 02:41.119
<span style="style.default_1">-You sure you don't need backup?</span>
-I'm sure.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.329
The intel that shopkeeper gave me
leads me to believe

02:43.413 --> 02:45.540
they could pull out
of their current location at any time.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.960
<span style="style.default_1">I need to act fast.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">This may be my only chance.</span>

02:49.043 --> 02:52.630
<span style="style.default_1">Plus, you guys still have</span>
<span style="style.default_1">plenty to do on Olkarion.</span>

02:52.714 --> 02:55.300
You're right. Good luck.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.802
Hey, while you're out,
will you look for some more fluuto beans?

02:58.803 --> 03:01.681
[Lance]
<span style="style.default_1">No, no, no! No more beans for Hunk!</span>

03:01.764 --> 03:02.765
[groans]

03:02.849 --> 03:03.850
Gotta go.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.431
[distant clanking]

03:51.272 --> 03:52.732
Shop's closed.

03:52.815 --> 03:56.277
I'm just looking for directions to a show.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.404
I heard it's explosive.

03:59.447 --> 04:03.952
So you're the one looking
for the nano-thermite titanium-boron?

04:04.035 --> 04:08.164
Very expensive.
Difficult to procure, I assure you.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.376
-Keep it.
-You're backing out of our agreement?

04:11.459 --> 04:14.003
Altering it, in your favor.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.089
I'll still give you the money,
but, in return,

04:16.172 --> 04:19.716
you tell me who is in this video
and where to find them.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.803
Why would I know those people?

04:21.886 --> 04:25.473
Because they used
nano-thermite titanium-boron,

04:25.556 --> 04:27.934
and you're the only one
in this section of the galaxy

04:28.017 --> 04:29.936
that seems to be selling it.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.981
I've had some good luck
selling things of value.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.191
And I think the Galra would pay a lot

04:35.275 --> 04:38.361
to know how you got your hands
on that security footage.

04:38.444 --> 04:43.700
Really? This is how we're doing it?
All I want is the information.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.329
-[grunts]
-[groans, gasps]

04:53.084 --> 04:56.170
[sighs]
Had to do it the hard way.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.010
[chuckles]
Thanks for the intel.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.845
[growls]

05:11.477 --> 05:12.645
Te-osh.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.775
Looks like I've got a positive ID.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.820
Last known whereabouts...

05:23.156 --> 05:24.824
Kraydah's moon.

05:29.912 --> 05:33.666
-Where did he go?
-I... I don't know.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.002
[whimpers]

05:36.085 --> 05:38.379
He's looking for someone
on Kraydah's moon.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.466
But you don't want to mess with him.
The weapon he was packing...

05:41.549 --> 05:43.676
I think he's a Paladin of Voltron.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.680
[chuckles]

05:47.764 --> 05:49.348
Even better.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.237
Oh, no! It's a Galra attack!
[grunts]

06:06.908 --> 06:08.367
[yelling]

06:09.160 --> 06:10.328
[grunts]

06:18.920 --> 06:20.505
[lion growling]

06:20.588 --> 06:25.426
Can it be? The Green Lion?
What an auspicious occasion!

06:28.471 --> 06:30.389
That must be one of the freedom fighters.

06:36.854 --> 06:41.234
Greetings. I am Lieutenant Ozar.
You must be one of the paladins.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.444
Yes, I'm Pidge. What's going on?

06:43.528 --> 06:46.405
We defeated a wave of Galra forces.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.117
More are coming, so we're evacuating.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.702
But now that you're here,
we might stand a chance.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.663
Will the other lions be here soon?

06:53.746 --> 06:56.541
I'm sorry, Voltron isn't coming.
It's just me.

06:56.624 --> 06:59.627
I'm looking for Te-osh. Is she here?

06:59.710 --> 07:03.756
Te-osh is inside the base loading up
the last of the medical supplies.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.801
We were just about to leave.
Your timing is most fortunate.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.970
Thank you.
I'll give you a hand loading up.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.723
-I just need to speak with her first.
-Thank you, Paladin Pidge.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.103
[grunts]
No!

07:19.188 --> 07:20.440
[grunting]

07:20.523 --> 07:21.524
They're back!

07:29.407 --> 07:31.284
Te-osh! Wait!

07:36.873 --> 07:38.624
Get to cover!

07:50.470 --> 07:51.762
[grunts]

07:52.722 --> 07:55.349
You're really, really gonna regret that.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.938
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, no.</span>

08:05.860 --> 08:07.820
<span style="style.default_1">Is everyone okay?</span>

08:07.904 --> 08:11.032
For now, thanks to you.
But our ship is damaged.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.701
We are stranded and cannot help Te-osh.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.746
Please, Paladin. You must help her.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.331
What about you?

08:18.414 --> 08:20.500
We know what it means to fight the Galra.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.794
The supplies on that ship
are more important than our lives.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.006
Everyone aboard, now!

08:36.933 --> 08:40.186
<span style="style.default_1">Te-osh, I'm a Paladin of Voltron.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'm here to help.</span>

08:41.187 --> 08:42.480
[Te-osh]
<span style="style.default_1">Please.</span>

08:42.563 --> 08:44.357

<span style="style.default_1">I've been hit.</span>

-[groaning]

09:01.499 --> 09:03.876
Oh, no. Are you okay?

09:04.919 --> 09:05.920
[groans]

09:06.546 --> 09:08.130
[coughs]

09:08.214 --> 09:09.340
The ship...

09:09.423 --> 09:12.385
-Those supplies are needed immediately.
-Not without you.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.262
[coughing]

09:15.930 --> 09:18.933
That's not good.
I'm gonna get you some help.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.518
[coughs]

09:20.601 --> 09:21.602
Matt?

09:23.312 --> 09:25.940
He's my brother. I'm trying to find him.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.608
You look so much like him.

09:28.693 --> 09:29.819
It's the eyes.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.572
-[coughs]
-[electronic beep]

09:33.364 --> 09:37.952
Here. Every rebel officer has
one of these transponders.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.329
It's how we find each other in the field.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.247
[groans]

09:42.415 --> 09:43.916
[groans]

09:44.709 --> 09:48.129
He may not have his anymore,
but this is his code.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.547
[coughs]

09:51.507 --> 09:56.345
Now, please... please help
get these supplies to my people.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.869
<span style="style.default_1">This should be far enough, Paladin Pidge.</span>

10:19.952 --> 10:21.912
<span style="style.default_1">I've sent our coordinates</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to the rendezvous party</span>

10:21.996 --> 10:23.706
<span style="style.default_1">and they will be here shortly.</span>

10:23.789 --> 10:25.207
<span style="style.default_1">Thank you for your help.</span>

10:25.291 --> 10:29.128
<span style="style.default_1">These supplies will save countless lives</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in our fight against the Galra.</span>

10:29.211 --> 10:31.505
<span style="style.default_1">I am sending you my transponder code.</span>

10:31.589 --> 10:36.344
<span style="style.default_1">May the Paladins of Voltron always</span>
<span style="style.default_1">be able to find me, if necessary.</span>

10:36.427 --> 10:37.595
Thank you.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.442
[electronic beeping]

10:53.194 --> 10:54.779
[electronic beeping]

11:00.868 --> 11:03.037
[beeping continues]

11:03.120 --> 11:05.539
[beeping fades]

11:07.333 --> 11:10.628
-[Matt] I just got a message from Dad.
-[Pidge] A message?

11:10.711 --> 11:13.130
Well, actually, it's a quantum frequency.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.092
But I thought we weren't supposed
to talk to Dad. It's a secret mission.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.344
What the Garrison doesn't know
won't hurt 'em.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.180
We're using a special two-step encryption.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.141
See? Dad and I both have this book, right?

11:24.225 --> 11:26.852
-Totally.
-Well, that's the cypher.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.479
We need it to read the messages.

11:28.562 --> 11:32.316
So the quantum frequency tells us
where in the book to look.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.611
-Okay.
-But that's not the best part.

11:35.694 --> 11:39.615
Dad and I know a second requirement.
The real code.

11:40.741 --> 11:44.412
We both memorize additions
and subtractions to numbers we send

11:44.495 --> 11:48.165
so that even if someone intercepts
our messages and has the same book,

11:48.249 --> 11:51.085
they still don't know what we're saying.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.045
Seems a little low-tech.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.424
Sure, but you can't rely
too much on computers.

11:56.507 --> 12:00.553
The most powerful processor you have
is right here.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.930
And it can never be hacked.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.641
Well, what's it say?

12:06.600 --> 12:10.354
It says, "Bedtime is still ten,
even if I'm in space."

12:10.438 --> 12:12.106
Ten?

12:12.189 --> 12:15.317
Just like the Garrison,
what Dad doesn't know won't hurt him.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.535
[electronic beeping]

12:24.618 --> 12:28.205
Matt's signal is getting stronger.
He must be around here somewhere.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.211
There! Oh, no.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.339
This... This can't be right.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.440
This place... It's completely destroyed.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.943
But it says he's here.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.370

15:56.205 --> 15:59.792
A quantum frequency.
It's... It's a message!

16:01.126 --> 16:03.128
The code!

16:03.212 --> 16:07.591
But what... what's the second
encryption item? I have the book!

16:12.471 --> 16:15.224
Now, factor in Dad and Matt's
additions and subtractions...

16:18.268 --> 16:20.813
[gasps]
These are coordinates.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.024
He's alive!

16:39.123 --> 16:43.085
This isn't good.
Two Galra cruisers and even more nearby.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.339
<span style="style.default_1">I'm coming, Matt.</span>

17:14.657 --> 17:18.579
There doesn't seem to be anyone
or anything here.

17:49.985 --> 17:50.986
It's a dead end.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.125
Gravity?

18:08.253 --> 18:10.672
Something must be
generating gravity nearby.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.319
This must be some kind of spy facility.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.572
Oh, my gosh!

19:16.655 --> 19:19.825
 Ever since the Kerberos Mission,
they said you were dead,

19:19.908 --> 19:22.202
but I knew in my heart that you weren't!

19:23.162 --> 19:25.789
I can't believe you found me.
It doesn't seem possible.

19:27.624 --> 19:31.879
The thought of you and Dad kept me going,
inspired me to do the impossible.

19:31.962 --> 19:36.508
Okay, but seriously,
how'd you get this far into space?

19:36.592 --> 19:40.470
It's a long story. Is there any chance
you've heard of Voltron?

19:40.554 --> 19:44.850
-Of course, I've heard of Voltron.
-Well, I'm one of the paladins.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.396
No! No! Seriously?

19:49.479 --> 19:53.901
You're a Paladin of Voltron?
That's so awesome!

19:53.984 --> 19:56.737
What a touching reunion.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.991
-Who are you?
-Who I am is not important.

20:01.074 --> 20:04.286
I am here to collect a bounty
on your brother Matt.

20:04.369 --> 20:09.708
But a Paladin of Voltron
and the Green Lion? What a day.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.293
-Stand back, Matt.
-Stand back, Pidge.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.339
Let's show this guy
what the Holts are made of.

20:15.422 --> 20:20.344
Looks to me like you're made of meat,
just like everyone else!

20:20.427 --> 20:22.638
[grunting]

20:23.055 --> 20:25.182
[screams]

20:25.265 --> 20:27.267
Stay away from my sister!

20:27.351 --> 20:29.019
[grunting]

20:29.102 --> 20:30.103
[screams]

20:30.187 --> 20:34.566
You're both worth more to me alive,
but I'll take something over nothing.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.152
-[grunts]
-[screams]

20:38.820 --> 20:40.322
[chuckles, groans]

20:42.241 --> 20:43.992
You'll have to do better than that!

20:50.499 --> 20:51.875
[grunting]

20:55.754 --> 20:57.589
Pidge, the panel!

20:58.632 --> 21:00.259
[grunts]

21:00.342 --> 21:01.843
-What?
-Matt, now!

21:06.306 --> 21:09.351
[screaming]

21:10.352 --> 21:12.771
-[sighs]
-[both grunting]

21:17.025 --> 21:18.485
[groans]

21:18.568 --> 21:20.570
[both breathing heavily]

21:20.654 --> 21:24.700
Good thinking, exposing that electric whip
to the asteroid's magnetic field.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.829
You're the one who recognized
he was clearly using direct current

21:28.912 --> 21:30.831
and thought about completing the circuit.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.625
-Tesla!
-[both laugh]

21:33.709 --> 21:36.878
I have the coolest little sister
in the whole galaxy.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.797
Now, all we have to do is find Dad.

21:40.215 --> 21:43.427
-You kept the glasses?
-Of course, I did.

21:45.053 --> 21:49.182
[camera shutter clicking]

21:53.603 --> 21:57.190
-All right, Katie.
-No, call me Pidge.

21:57.274 --> 22:00.360
I'm gonna miss that. And you.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.447
I'm gonna miss you, too.
But, you know, space!

22:03.530 --> 22:05.615
-I'm so excited!
-I know!

22:05.699 --> 22:08.368
But I can't believe I have to go
through middle school without you.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.954
You can talk to me anytime.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.457
I thought I wasn't allowed
to bother you guys on your mission.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.085
Of course, you're not.
But you know the code.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.420
What the Garrison doesn't know...

22:18.503 --> 22:21.089
-[chuckles]
-Hey, check this out.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.597
-Don't you need these?
-Not anymore.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.348
The Garrison fixed my eyes.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.810
-I look way cooler now, yeah?
-No.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.103
[chuckles]

22:35.187 --> 22:36.354
[laughs]

22:37.147 --> 22:38.774
I'll be back soon.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.401
You better, or I'm coming up
to space and getting you.
