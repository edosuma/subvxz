But at home I sleep on the
right side, so probably there.

We don't mean to be rude, but you seem
to be much younger than your husband.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.296
You're not rude. I'm very much younger.
Is that a problem?

10:18.377 --> 10:20.504
Well, it's just that
there's a good chance...

10:20.588 --> 10:23.465
you'll be moving in
long before she would.

your wife remarries,

10:27.012 --> 10:29.429

rest with her new husband.

to the highest bidder.

I'm sorry for accusing you.

- I knew it. You two-faced-

- I was not.

were gonna leave,

Did she just clap?
She heard “adopted” and clapped.

20:16.626 --> 20:18.752
Cam, that's amazing.

20:18.837 --> 20:21.547
Oh, my God. You did that.

20:21.629 --> 20:24.424
Wha- You did that.
That is amazing.

20:24.508 --> 20:26.134
I can't believe that.

20:26.218 --> 20:29.680
And just like that,
peace returned to our house.

20:31.138 --> 20:33.683
Well, technically,
it's my house, but...

20:33.766 --> 20:36.644
I-I Will- I Will fix that too.

20:39.730 --> 20:42.524
Once we finished writing the book,
we realized something.

20:42.606 --> 20:44.817
We're not the only two monkeys
with a panda.

20:44.901 --> 20:48.238
Gay parents are a huge market,
and no one's writing for them.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.365
We thought we were
sitting on a gold mine.

20:51.449 --> 20:52.908
But we weren't.

20:54.535 --> 20:56.202
Let's see.
Oh.

20:56.287 --> 20:58.329
“Gay Parenting.”
Oh.

20:58.454 --> 21:00.498
“Gay Adoptive Parenting.”
Okay.

21:00.623 --> 21:02.875
“Gay Adoption Foreign Children.”
Wow.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.253
“Gay Adoption Asian Children.”
What?

21:05.378 --> 21:08.046
“Bisexual Adoption Asian Children.”
Oh!

21:08.131 --> 21:10.173
“Transgendered Adoption.”

21:10.257 --> 21:12.926
[Sighs]
Okay, come on. Let's go, Miko.
