00:01.919 --> 00:05.422
Previously on 90210...
Preventative mastectomy
won't affect your fertility,

00:05.464 --> 00:07.591
but a lot of women put off
having their ovaries removed

00:07.633 --> 00:09.802
until after
they've had children.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.720
I want to have a baby,
and if I'm gonna do it,

00:11.762 --> 00:13.639
I have to do it right now, so,
which one of you is up for that?

00:13.681 --> 00:15.683
Yup. That's what I thought.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.643
That's why
I choose you.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.103
Will you have a baby
with me, Teddy?

00:20.145 --> 00:23.190
Our movie is doing so well,
it got picked up for a sequel.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.441
Just won't do the movie.

00:24.483 --> 00:27.695
That contract is worth $200,000.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.112
Unless you've got that
laying around

00:29.154 --> 00:32.741
somewhere, I suggest
you get used to this face.

00:32.783 --> 00:33.909
(electrical pop)

00:35.703 --> 00:37.538
LIAM:
The fire marshal's sending over

00:37.579 --> 00:39.373
the report today.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.583
I was hoping to get the check
as soon as possible.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.751
I just went through
a bad breakup, and I needed

00:42.793 --> 00:43.878
to get the guy out of my head.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.379
Well, I'm gonna write
down my phone number,

00:45.420 --> 00:46.839
'cause I don't believe
for one second

00:46.881 --> 00:48.340
you won't want
to do this again.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.300
Looking for Adrianna
Tate-Duncan.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.468
Taylor Williams.
I'm a club promoter.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.052
I was supposed to
catch her show in Vegas.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.222
She's at hospital
with her boyfriend.

00:55.263 --> 00:58.099
Naomi Clark,
will you marry me?

00:58.141 --> 01:00.019
You and Max are a mistake,

01:00.060 --> 01:03.355
and I am not gonna let you
ruin his life again.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.989
Wait. Naomi Clark
goes on vacation

01:12.031 --> 01:13.991
and she only brings
one suitcase?

01:14.033 --> 01:16.076
Did I miss an announcement
of the apocalypse?

01:16.117 --> 01:17.244
Darling, it's
our honeymoon.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.747
I don't plan
on wearing that much clothing.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.289
(laughs)

01:21.331 --> 01:24.543
Actually, I'm feeling a little
overdressed at the moment.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.294
Why, Mrs. Clark-Miller,

01:26.336 --> 01:29.048
you look cold.

01:29.088 --> 01:30.298
Let me warm you.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.968
Oh, how very thoughtful
of you, Mr. Miller-Clark.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.177
(laughs)

01:34.219 --> 01:35.262
(doorbell rings)

01:35.303 --> 01:36.430
Mmm.
Mmm.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.265
Ugh! Car's early.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.474
He can wait.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.560
No. Probably Alec.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.271
He was gonna stop by and
drop off a wedding gift.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.689
Really?
Yeah.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.524
Gift certificate for
a divorce lawyer?

01:47.566 --> 01:50.318
What?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.237
Okay, look,
I haven't told you this

01:52.279 --> 01:54.239
because I know
how close you two are,

01:54.281 --> 01:56.992
but after we got married,
Alec said I'm,

01:57.034 --> 02:00.996
and I quote, "a huge mistake."

02:01.038 --> 02:02.456
Okay, look, so maybe

02:02.497 --> 02:07.127
I didn't exactly talk
you up after we broke up.

02:07.168 --> 02:10.297
Both times. But I love you, and
he wants what's best for me,

02:10.338 --> 02:15.176
so I... I think eventually he'll
see past our sordid history.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.428
Hey, there he is.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.679
Oh, yeah.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.723
Got something for you.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.063
Congratulations
on your nuptials.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.358
"Cosmetic heiress
Madison Stewart,

02:30.400 --> 02:32.402
"known best
for her puppy rescue charities,

02:32.444 --> 02:34.195
"was left at
the altar

02:34.237 --> 02:38.366
"by software impresario
Max Miller when...

02:38.408 --> 02:40.702
"Beverly Hills
bad girl, Naomi Clark..."

02:40.744 --> 02:41.954
I like that.

02:41.996 --> 02:42.871
"...broke up
her wedding.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.081
"One guest
was quoted

02:44.123 --> 02:46.249
"as saying, 'Max Miller must be

02:46.291 --> 02:48.836
out of his mind or on drugs.'"

02:48.877 --> 02:51.046
That was probably
my mother.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.172
NAOMI: The gossip mags
can have their fun.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.509
We are above
their idle chatter.
Yeah.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.969
Yes?
Yeah.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.013
It's not just idle chatter.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.556
Our stock price
dropped ten points.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.934
Turns out, investors
don't like it

03:03.976 --> 03:06.020
when the head
of the company looks unstable.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.855
Now, we need
to do some damage control.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.439
He's right.
You have to deal with this.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.775
I mean, the way we got married--
it makes you look...

03:11.817 --> 03:13.234
a little crazy, it does.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.404
I get that, but I also want to
start our marriage off right.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.948
NAOMI:
Well, me, too, sweetie,

03:17.990 --> 03:19.240
but if your business collapses

03:19.282 --> 03:21.910
because we got married,
that's not gonna happen.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.996
Ah.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.414
Besides, it's fine. It's okay.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.459
It doesn't matter
that we're not in Ibiza.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.962
We can just...

03:32.004 --> 03:36.550
stay here and practice
for when we do go.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.218
Okay?

03:38.259 --> 03:39.845
Okay.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.013
Mmm. Mmm.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.640
ALEC: I guess I'll wait
for you in the car.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.392
Uh-huh.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.977
Hey, thanks for
the help, guys.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.062
How's Dixon?

03:48.103 --> 03:49.688
He's good. He's
coming home tonight.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.690
He says he wants a full report.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.068
So... desolate,

03:54.109 --> 03:56.945
ravaged, war-torn?

03:56.987 --> 03:58.446
That's one way to look at it.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.824
Or, as our club promoter says,
it's a great way to start over.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.034
You're going to love him.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.493
Oh, that reminds me, he said

04:03.535 --> 04:05.579
he's going to bring us by a club
he opened a few months back,

04:05.620 --> 04:07.372
give us an idea of how
to make this place more chill.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.916
I'll be busy
with my movie, so...

04:08.957 --> 04:11.043
I trust you guys.
You can do what you want.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.293
That's it?

04:12.335 --> 04:13.962
You work your ass off
for a business,

04:14.004 --> 04:15.714
it burns to the ground,
and you shrug?

04:15.756 --> 04:16.964
Well, I mean, you know,

04:17.007 --> 04:19.218
look, the important thing is,
no one was hurt, right?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.928
The insurance adjuster came by
with my check,

04:20.969 --> 04:23.805
so, I'm just gonna pay off
some debts and not look back.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.515
NAVID: Yeah, like that chick
in the bible.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.976
She looked back, and bam!
Pillar of salt.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.311
I ain't gonna be no pillar
of salt, baby.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.646
(tool thuds)
What?

04:31.688 --> 04:32.731
I'm telling you,

04:32.773 --> 04:34.191
no more Mr. Nice Guy.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.276
You're looking
at the new Navid Shirazi,

04:36.317 --> 04:38.112
ladies' man
and club entrepreneur.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.529
Okay, well,

04:39.571 --> 04:42.574
the new Navid Shirazi might want
to start by untucking his shirt.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.952
(Liam laughs)
Oh, guys, I have to go.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.412
I want to be home
by the time Dixon gets there.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.663
Oh, tell him
we said hey.
I will.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.707
You ready to take this

04:50.749 --> 04:52.834
to the garbage,
Mr. Smooth-Talking Ladies' Man?

04:52.876 --> 04:54.211
(feigns laughs)

04:54.253 --> 04:56.838
Yeah, you laugh now, but
I'm telling you... I'm cool now.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.465
All right.
(groans)

04:58.506 --> 04:59.758
Oh, come on. Aah.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.390
Oh, my God, what are
you doing here?

05:07.432 --> 05:10.144
I am stalking you.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.145
Is that not obvious?
(scoffs)

05:11.186 --> 05:12.312
(laughs) I'm kidding.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.563
I'm here to see Navid.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.356
We're working together
on the Offshore re-launch.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.358
Wait. You're the club promoter?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.153
And you were the music act
I was supposed to see in Vegas,

05:19.194 --> 05:20.612
and I never told you my name,
so, I'm Taylor.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.530
I don't need
to know your name, okay?

05:22.572 --> 05:24.866
I told you in Vegas,
it was a one-time thing.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.995
It started off that way,
but I'm not going to lie to you.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.412
I can't stop thinking about you.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.957
Okay, well,
you're gonna have to try,

05:31.999 --> 05:34.251
because I am back together
with my boyfriend.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.460
Yes, because
of his accident.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.587
And I'm sorry
to hear about that,

05:37.629 --> 05:39.173
but come on, Adrianna.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.049
Clearly, we had something
between us.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.218
No. No, we did not.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.554
Okay, he was coming back for me,
and the only reason

05:46.596 --> 05:48.223
I was with
you is because

05:48.265 --> 05:50.267
I didn't know that.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.019
Okay?

05:52.060 --> 05:53.728
He can't know about this.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.063
Please don't say anything.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.398
What happened between you
and me meant nothing.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.484
Wait.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.864
You left this at the hotel.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.949
Just in case.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.372
ANNIE:
Oh, okay, so,

06:13.414 --> 06:16.001
I put your lunch in the fridge
with the re-heat time,

06:16.043 --> 06:19.171
but if you can't reach the
microwave, I will do it for you.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.714
Okay.
The blinds
are turned up

06:20.755 --> 06:22.423
so you don't get too
much sun in your eyes.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.134
What?

06:24.176 --> 06:25.260
Incomplete spinal trauma

06:25.302 --> 06:27.346
doesn't necessarily mean
complete vegetable.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.806
I know, but you were
in a huge accident,

06:29.848 --> 06:32.893
and I know that you have
a 50/50 chance of recovery,

06:32.934 --> 06:35.478
but it could still
take some time.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.897
(sighs)

06:36.938 --> 06:38.357
Look, the only way Mom agreed

06:38.397 --> 06:41.235
to go back to Paris
was if she knew I was here

06:41.276 --> 06:44.363
taking care of you, so that is
exactly what I plan to do.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.531
I will stay
as long as you need me.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.658
(groans)

06:48.700 --> 06:50.577
Hi.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.371
Hey.
You're home!

06:52.411 --> 06:54.622
I'm so sorry I wasn't here
when you got here.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.376
It's all good. I mean,
we just got here ourselves.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.878
(laughs)

06:59.920 --> 07:03.257
Man, I've been waiting all day
for that welcome-home pat.
I'm sorry.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.050
I just don't want to hurt you.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.094
If I can survive getting hit
by a semitruck,

07:07.135 --> 07:08.678
I think I can handle a kiss.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.056
(laughs)

07:14.935 --> 07:16.603
You okay?

07:16.644 --> 07:18.646
Yeah. Absolutely.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.814
How's the Offshore?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.858
Navid was telling me
about this new club promoter

07:21.900 --> 07:22.943
who seems pretty cool.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.527
He's all right.
You know him?

07:24.569 --> 07:27.948
No. No, I mean, I just ran
into him on my way out today.

07:27.989 --> 07:32.744
We didn't really talk much
or... do anything else.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.662
I'm so happy you are home.
Oh, my gosh.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.581
(both laugh)

07:36.623 --> 07:38.417
Oh, you have no idea.
I'm-I'm just...

07:38.458 --> 07:40.127
(sighs)

07:40.168 --> 07:42.045
I'm just glad
to be back, and, um,

07:42.087 --> 07:43.922
get everything
back to normal.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.299
I, uh...

07:45.340 --> 07:47.008
Are you sure you're okay?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.551
Mm-hmm.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.846
I'm ready to get things
back to normal, too.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.975
As Emily Post
might have said,

07:55.016 --> 07:57.894
"When your homosexual best
friend fathers your child..."

07:57.936 --> 07:59.187
Mm-hmm.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.189
"...common etiquette dictates
a suitable gift."

08:01.231 --> 08:05.735
Oh. Two Men, One Bed.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.570
Good luck in there.

08:07.612 --> 08:12.533
Oh, look, I have been practicing
my entire youth for this moment.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.910
Have I told you how much

08:13.952 --> 08:15.454
I appreciate
you doing this for me?

08:15.495 --> 08:16.871
You're welcome.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.291
Now, when do you do your
part and get knocked up? Hmm?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.960
Ah, well, I come back into
the doctor when I'm ovulating,

08:22.002 --> 08:23.753
and they do
an old-fashioned turkey baste.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.713
Way to ruin Thanksgiving for me.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.007
(laughing)

08:27.048 --> 08:29.884
Oh, I'm sorry I have
to get back to D.C. tomorrow.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.386
Really wish
I could be here for you.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.888
Me, too.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.933
The truth is, I'm going to be
alone when I have the baby,

08:36.975 --> 08:38.934
so, I might as well
get used to it.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.479
Who says you have to be alone?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.938
You told me that you
couldn't decide how you felt

08:42.981 --> 08:45.108
about Liam and Navid
until you took the baby

08:45.150 --> 08:46.318
out of the picture, right?

08:46.360 --> 08:47.610
We got the baby covered.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.404
Yeah, but no.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.613
Navid made it clear

08:50.655 --> 08:53.450
me not picking him to have
the baby meant it was over,

08:53.492 --> 08:54.826
and Liam was really upset, too.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.786
Maybe that's because he
thought your choice meant

08:56.828 --> 08:58.205
it was over
between you two.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.249
I don't think he would be upset
if he didn't still care.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.668
You honestly think he would be
open to a relationship,

09:03.710 --> 09:06.004
even though
I'm having someone else's baby?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.423
Well, you never
know until you ask.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.596
Hi, Liam.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.265
I didn't mean to scare you.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.599
I got your message,

09:18.641 --> 09:20.601
and I came right away.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.895
I love what you've done
with the place.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.855
Yeah, and it's nice day out,

09:23.897 --> 09:26.358
but I really don't feel like
making small talk.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.319
I have your money.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.657
$200,000.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.369
I didn't think you'd be able
to come up with this.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.037
It's enough to buy you
out of your contract,

09:39.079 --> 09:40.497
and get you out of my life.

09:40.539 --> 09:44.543
It's a shame I can't accept
money you obtained fraudulently.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.798
What are you talking about?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.717
Your convenient little fire.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.469
It was ruled an accident.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.555
Yes... but...

09:56.596 --> 09:59.933
the investigators
didn't have this.

09:59.974 --> 10:03.520
You walked away and
let the fire burn.

10:03.562 --> 10:06.523
Oh, did I forget
to mention

10:06.565 --> 10:08.942
I had hidden cameras
installed a couple months ago?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.318
You know, I mean,
the waiters

10:10.360 --> 10:12.070
have such sticky
fingers, you know.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.114
Hey, don't even
think about it.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.241
It's not the only copy.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.869
What do you want?

10:19.911 --> 10:21.496
I already told you.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.956
A second chance.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.999
You're blackmailing me
into being with you?

10:25.041 --> 10:27.294
I admit I'm using the situation
to my advantage,

10:27.335 --> 10:30.338
but whether you know it or not,
we are good together.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.715
As a gesture
of good faith,

10:32.757 --> 10:33.883
I called the production company

10:33.925 --> 10:36.303
and had them move
all of your scenes to L.A.,

10:36.344 --> 10:38.679
so you don't have
to leave the country after all.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.140
If...

10:40.181 --> 10:42.309
by the time you're done
shooting your movie

10:42.350 --> 10:45.686
you still don't feel
anything for me...

10:45.728 --> 10:47.314
then I'll go.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.524
Just like that,
you're gonna walk away.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.151
Well, I'm...

10:51.192 --> 10:53.694
hoping I don't have to.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.615
What happens
if I don't agree?

10:59.951 --> 11:01.244
Then...

11:01.286 --> 11:03.455
(whispers):
I won't be the only one

11:03.497 --> 11:07.125
who will have watched
that video.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.794
(kisses)

11:14.591 --> 11:17.469
(theme music playing)

11:33.443 --> 11:35.320
Hey, do you think Ade
is acting weird?

11:35.362 --> 11:38.239
Like, um, I don't know,
like she can't handle all...

11:38.281 --> 11:39.449
all of this?

11:39.491 --> 11:41.284
'Course not.
She loves you.

11:41.326 --> 11:44.078
I know she loves me; I didn't
say she didn't love me.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.913
Why would you say that?
Thank-thank you, Annie,

11:45.955 --> 11:47.874
now it's in my head.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.917
Man, see, I wanted to
practice walking today.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.004
I mean, I am trying to get out
of this chair sometime soon.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.549
And you will-- it's
only been a couple of weeks.

11:55.590 --> 11:58.593
But you're squeezing that ball
like a ball-squeezin' champion!

11:58.635 --> 12:00.178
(feigns cheer)

12:01.971 --> 12:03.598
Oh. I got it.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.975
Hey. Think fast.

12:06.017 --> 12:06.976
(grunts)

12:07.018 --> 12:08.019
Dude.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.896
Name's Riley.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.730
What is your problem?
Uh...

12:11.772 --> 12:12.982
let's see, um...

12:13.024 --> 12:15.902
I suffer from insomnia,
I'm a huge Civil War buff,

12:15.943 --> 12:18.321
and most people find me
offensively arrogant.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.407
You think this is funny?
He almost died.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.617
It was a ball-- besides,
I didn't throw it that hard.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.619
And if he ever wants
to catch a ball again,

12:24.661 --> 12:26.037
let alone walk,
then you need

12:26.079 --> 12:27.372
to stop babying him.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.083
It's cool. She, uh, you know,
she's just trying to help.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.418
Yeah, well, that
may be, but you

12:31.459 --> 12:32.919
need to tell your girlfriend
that you're not

12:32.960 --> 12:34.588
a charity case
just because you're in a chair.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.464
I'm not his girlfriend;
I'm his sister.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.383
And, Dixon, don't
listen to this guy.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.842
He's just an ass.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.886
Ouch.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.680
Thank you.
(clears throat)

12:43.722 --> 12:46.807
I didn't realize.
I am so sorry.
Why?

12:46.849 --> 12:48.435
You thought I was a jerk.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.894
In fact, you might have
found yourself wondering

12:49.936 --> 12:52.647
what I might be like in bed,
but now that I'm in this chair

12:52.689 --> 12:55.024
you feel sorry for me
and sex is out of the question.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.318
Well, no... I mean, yeah, but...

12:57.360 --> 12:58.903
See? I proved my point, Dixon.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.488
People see us
different.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.407
If you keep treating him
like he's helpless,

13:02.449 --> 13:03.991
that's all he's ever gonna be.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.702
(exhales)

13:10.039 --> 13:12.667
So much for our
sunny day at the beach!
(groans)

13:12.709 --> 13:15.295
I thought you and Max were
going to Ibiza to get a tan.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.214
We were. He's dealing
with the "insanity"

13:18.256 --> 13:20.383
of us getting married,
which apparently

13:20.425 --> 13:22.469
makes us appear "unstable."

13:22.510 --> 13:25.388
Stock prices are still down,
which just gives Alex fuel

13:25.430 --> 13:27.766
to back his accusation
that I'm a "mistake."

13:27.806 --> 13:29.434
That...
"totally sucks."

13:29.476 --> 13:31.018
Seriously,
every time Max

13:31.060 --> 13:32.979
puts out one fire,
another article pops up

13:33.020 --> 13:34.063
with our mug shots.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.607
Madison's PR team
is working overtime

13:35.649 --> 13:37.692
to make my marriage
look like a train wreck.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.153
Well, it sounds like
you need PR of your own.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.239
I have this great guy who can
literally gloss over anything.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.492
Like when I practically
killed Silver.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.118
I am so sorry about that,
by the way.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.620
Mm-hmm, yeah.
That's right!

13:48.662 --> 13:50.955
You handed out all that water
to those thirsty African kids.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.082
Mm-hmm.
I should do that.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.793
But something less dusty.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.170
To be fair, Max
and I did run off

13:57.211 --> 13:59.339
(laughs):
under the cover of darkness.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.634
So I will throw a wedding
reception in the light of day.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.720
I'll show the entire public
that we are stable

14:05.762 --> 14:07.096
and focused and steady.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.182
What would be your
ideal wedding reception?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.476
A winery?

14:11.518 --> 14:12.977
Wait, why me?
Winery--
that's brilliant.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.730
I mean, it's boring,
but it photographs well.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.524
I'll invite a
photographer.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.817
Max will do an amazing speech

14:18.857 --> 14:20.360
about how stable
and focused he is.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.820
The stock prices
will come back up.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.655
I'll start my marriage
with a clean slate.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.114
You guys need
to clear your calendars

14:25.156 --> 14:27.575
and line up a date-- we're
going to Malibu Wine Country

14:27.617 --> 14:28.618

circling your perimeter,

14:33.206 --> 14:34.874
but can you
narrow it down to one.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.669
Just... this reception
needs to be respectable.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.759
So, is Ade still
picking you up for dinner?

stuck at the beach with Naomi

(scoffs) Okay, I wouldn't chew
your food-- that's disgusting--

14:59.899 --> 15:01.192
but fine, I won't get you pizza.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.486
Oh, can I use your phone?
I want to text Ade

Well, yours don't fit;
you've lost some weight
since the accident.

Yeah, but I'm
gonna gain it back.
I know,

15:12.537 --> 15:15.206

But in the meantime,
you thought it would be cool

15:15.248 --> 15:17.375

what I freak I look like?

15:17.417 --> 15:18.793
You don't look like a freak.

No wonder Ade's
been acting weird.
Ade has not

15:20.670 --> 15:22.922
been acting weird, and
I'm sorry about the T-shirts,

to be embarrassed about.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.808
Well, stop, okay? Stop.

Thing is, I wouldn't be having
a baby at 20 if I didn't have

the BRCA gene, and I know that
you're not ready to be a dad,

(laughs)

17:37.932 --> 17:39.225
Now if you'll please excuse me,

17:39.266 --> 17:42.395
I am picking out swans for
Max and my wedding reception.

17:42.436 --> 17:47.775
Swans mate for life, you know,
like Max and me.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.694
Let them know I'll go with

17:49.736 --> 17:50.945
Swan package B.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.406
I'm pretty sure Wall Street
will care a lot more

17:53.447 --> 17:57.410
about a new piece of business
than monogamous birds.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.453
Anyway, Max and I
have been looking

17:59.495 --> 18:00.914
to expand into video games.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.999
And the Colton Brothers
are the biggest names

18:03.041 --> 18:04.709
in cutting-edge gaming, right?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.878
I got them to agree
to sit down with us.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.338
Perfect! You can invite them
to the wedding reception.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.673
(scoffs)

18:10.715 --> 18:13.133
I am not inviting billionaire
investors to your little party.

18:13.175 --> 18:17.346
Look, Alec, I realize
we got off on the wrong foot,

18:17.388 --> 18:20.016
but I believe this wedding
reception will make our marriage

18:20.058 --> 18:22.018
legitimate in everyone's eyes,
including yours.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.811
And on top of that,
it's good for business.

18:23.853 --> 18:24.938
You don't know
our business.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.188
And the Colton Brothers...

18:26.230 --> 18:27.774
Are businessmen.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.734
They respond to elegance, class
and quiet displays of wealth.

18:29.776 --> 18:30.985
I know what I'm doing, Alec.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.361
Don't forget,

18:32.403 --> 18:35.197
this is my business now, too.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.241
You're right,
I hadn't thought of that.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.702
If you think that throwing
a party is the best way

18:39.744 --> 18:42.789
to solve our problems,
who am I to disagree?

18:42.830 --> 18:44.874
Swans are a great touch.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.297
(sighs)

18:51.338 --> 18:54.842
Okay.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.928
Come on.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.765
Well, that's all my stuff.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.767
I'm moving out now.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.518
Guess I'll see you at the party.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.770
Or not.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.444
(sighs)

19:16.030 --> 19:17.448
Annie, I said I'm sorry.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.825
Don't.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.744
I really don't want to
talk about it, okay?

19:25.039 --> 19:25.957
(door opens)

19:25.999 --> 19:27.374
ADRIANNA:
Hey.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.460
I found the best shoes
to go with my dress.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.046
Are you going to ride with us
to Naomi's party?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.798
Ask my brother.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.302
(door opens, closes)

19:38.344 --> 19:40.680
It's a long story.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.681
Okay.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.975
Well, then I guess it's just

19:44.017 --> 19:45.101
me, you and Navid.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.310
Actually, it's just, uh,

19:46.352 --> 19:47.478
you and me. Nice.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.022
Uh, Navid's going with
the club promoter.

19:49.063 --> 19:52.441
He's bringing Taylor
to the wedding reception?

19:52.483 --> 19:54.652
Yeah. Apparently, they got
a couple dates or something.

19:58.238 --> 20:01.742
You know, we don't have
to go to the party.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.369
I thought you wanted to go.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.621
I mean, you just
bought some shoes.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.914
Yeah, for dancing.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.624
I don't know what
I was thinking.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.085
You just got out
of the hospital.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.546
If you want to stay in,
that's totally fine.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.548
Look, I may not be able to climb
a mountain right now,

20:15.589 --> 20:17.216
but I can handle a wedding.
You know that, right?

20:17.257 --> 20:19.510
Of course I do, yeah.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.805
Good. I'm gonna be back
to normal soon, okay?

20:22.847 --> 20:24.140
But don't worry about me.

20:24.182 --> 20:25.391
We're going to that party.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.560
(knocking on door)

20:27.601 --> 20:29.311
Hello?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.438
SILVER:
Hey.
Hey.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.900
Teddy, thank you for staying
in town and being my date.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.026
Come on, don't do that.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.485
No, the whole thing's
got me really emotional.

20:36.527 --> 20:41.448
The baby and Liam and Navid.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.994
You know, it's not like
I expected them to wait,

20:45.036 --> 20:49.498
but they both moved on
really, really fast.

20:49.540 --> 20:54.420
It's like everyone I thought
loved me actually didn't.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.964
And on top of everything else,
my temperature was up

20:57.006 --> 20:58.298
this morning, I checked.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.759
And I'm ovulating.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.095
Except we have to go
to this wedding reception,

21:02.136 --> 21:04.263
which means I'm gonna
have to miss this month.

21:04.304 --> 21:08.101
Unless we can just...
do it in Malibu.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.103
(chuckles)
Well...

21:10.144 --> 21:11.812
Okay, that was a joke.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.606
(chuckles,
clears throat)

21:13.647 --> 21:15.191
Well, you know, hey,
we should get going.

21:15.233 --> 21:18.778
Traffic on PCH
can be really bad.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.574
♪ ♪

21:40.049 --> 21:41.884
VANESSA:
Hey.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.177
I hope you're
hungry.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.929
I made chicken.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.931
What is this,
what's going on?

21:46.973 --> 21:48.599
It's our new house.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.685
I rented it for the month and
we can see how we like it.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.981
Uh, I am not moving in.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.650
Well, we can't exactly live
in the bar you burned down.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.152
We never agreed
to live together.

21:59.193 --> 22:00.111
That is not part
of the deal.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.570
What did you think
I meant by "try"?

22:01.612 --> 22:03.197
I don't know, maybe go
to Naomi's party,

22:03.239 --> 22:04.490
grab some coffee.

22:04.531 --> 22:08.786
You think a latte is
going to keep me happy?

22:08.828 --> 22:11.080
I may have read the
situation wrong.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.999
I've got a
call to make.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.917
Damn it, wait.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.295
I am not a patient
person, Liam.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.838
I need to know
right now.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.965
Are you in or not?

22:22.633 --> 22:25.511
Yes.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.139
How do I know
you're serious?

22:43.237 --> 22:45.323
(moans)

23:09.429 --> 23:11.389
Oh, get a photo
of Max and me

23:11.431 --> 23:13.851
waiting for our
guests, will you?

23:13.893 --> 23:15.936
Oh, honey, I should have rented
an Afghan hound.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.771
Do you think they have breeders
here in Malibu?

23:17.813 --> 23:18.772
Naomi, it's fine.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.483
Everything's perfect.
Okay, okay.

23:21.525 --> 23:22.985
Let me fix
your tie, okay.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.278
All right.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.030
Perfect.

23:27.156 --> 23:29.242
And get
the swans.

23:29.283 --> 23:31.577
Oh, my God,
what the hell?

23:31.618 --> 23:33.829
Navid.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.164
(chuckling):
Hi.

23:35.206 --> 23:36.207
Give me one second.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.334
What made you think it
would be a good idea

23:38.376 --> 23:39.919
to bring hookers
to my party?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.212
This reception is
supposed to make

23:41.254 --> 23:42.380
me and Max look legitimate.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.548
They're not hookers,
they're adult film stars.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.051
Th-They used
to work for my dad.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.969
I need them as part
of my new image.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.971
Okay, that's fine, put
some clothes on them.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.973
For God's sakes, I
can see side boob.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.895
Oh.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.606
Hi.
Hey.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.608
Thanks.
Hey, uh, babe,

24:02.649 --> 24:05.652
look, I-I'm just gonna stay
here an-an-and enjoy the view.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.154
You know, the bar looks
kind of crowded.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.073
Why don't you go get us
some drinks or something,

24:09.115 --> 24:10.074
and I'll meet you
over there?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.575
You sure?
Yeah, yeah,

24:11.617 --> 24:13.493
I'm positive.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.371
Okay.

24:15.413 --> 24:16.580
(both chuckle)

24:31.304 --> 24:32.430
Annie,

24:32.470 --> 24:34.348
honey, your brother
is stuck

24:34.390 --> 24:36.225
at the top
of the stairs.
Not my problem.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.227
You're seriously
gonna leave him there
like a little kitten?

24:38.269 --> 24:40.062
Well, he made it perfectly
clear he doesn't need my help,

24:40.104 --> 24:41.439
so if he wants to get
down those stairs,

24:41.479 --> 24:43.441
he can just bounce
himself on down.

24:43.481 --> 24:46.860
(laughs)
She's drunk.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.862
Do not taunt
your handicapped brother

24:48.904 --> 24:50.323
when the investors arrive.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.408
Thank you.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.996
TEDDY:
This is nice.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.998
Little reserved for
Naomi unless she has

24:59.039 --> 25:01.834
some naked firemen jump
out of those swans.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.170
(both laugh)

25:04.211 --> 25:06.422
Wouldn't be
surprised.

25:06.464 --> 25:07.465
Navid?

25:07.505 --> 25:10.301
Hey, Silver.

25:10.343 --> 25:11.469
Can you believe
this view?

25:11.509 --> 25:16.015
Oh, uh, Ambrosia, Trixie,
this is Silver.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.183
Love your name.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.516
Oh.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.394
Teddy.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.313
(Navid chuckles)

25:22.355 --> 25:23.856
Well, I guess he's
doing just fine.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.774
VANESSA:
Hi, Silver.

25:26.692 --> 25:27.609
Hi.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.735
Well, I guess,
with me

25:28.777 --> 25:30.112
and Liam back together,

25:30.154 --> 25:32.490
the only date you could find
was your gay best friend?

25:32.530 --> 25:34.867
You must be Vanessa.

25:34.908 --> 25:35.784
Yeah.

25:35.826 --> 25:36.869
I can't believe we're so late.

25:36.910 --> 25:37.870
We were having sex.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.455
Vanessa.

25:39.497 --> 25:40.831
It's true.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.667
Mmm, I'm going
to get more wine.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.840
You know what?
I got this.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.758
MAN:
Whoo!

25:51.800 --> 25:54.387
(laughs)

25:54.428 --> 25:56.763
Oh, yo, is wine
the only alcoholic option?

25:56.805 --> 25:58.391
Okay, boys,
this is a private party.

25:58.432 --> 25:59.641
If you would
like to crash

25:59.683 --> 26:00.684
a wedding reception,
you can do so

26:00.726 --> 26:02.436
at a chain hotel
in Bakersfield.

26:02.478 --> 26:05.189
Security, please escort
these gentlemen out.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.274
Thank you very much.

26:10.027 --> 26:12.029
Thank goodness the
photographer went home already

26:12.071 --> 26:13.780
and did not see
those punks.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.115
(laughs)

26:15.157 --> 26:17.034
We have all the
respectable photos we need.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.953
Everyone is behaving, even
Navid's hoochie mamas.

26:19.995 --> 26:20.871
(chuckles)

26:20.913 --> 26:22.289
But I do think
we need a code

26:22.331 --> 26:24.833
for when the Colton
brothers actually arrive.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.085
Maybe say,

26:26.126 --> 26:29.587
"The wild boar roams
the savannah."

26:29.629 --> 26:32.007
Sure, except I don't know
what they look like.

26:32.049 --> 26:33.926
Alec's really the one
who deals with the clients;

26:33.967 --> 26:34.927
I don't.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.262
I'm just the brains.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.346
Oh.
I know,

26:37.388 --> 26:38.347
it's very sexy.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.224
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

26:40.266 --> 26:41.892
Hey, did you see a couple
of guys in flip-flops?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.601
Oh, do not worry, I had
security kick them out.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.645
They will not be
embarrassing us.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.315
What?

26:48.357 --> 26:51.527
Those are
the Colton brothers.

26:51.569 --> 26:52.736
Congratulations,
you just

26:52.778 --> 26:55.406
threw out the only hope
of saving our business.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.707
Oh, skater dude guys,
please.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.751
Hi, there's been
a mistake.

27:07.793 --> 27:08.752
I...
I have to apologize.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.170
If you'll come with
me, I'd like you

27:10.212 --> 27:12.423
to meet my business partner
Max Miller.

27:12.465 --> 27:13.924
You drag our asses all
the way up to Malibu

27:13.966 --> 27:15.426
and then she
kicks us out.

27:15.468 --> 27:16.843
Yeah, that's gonna
be a pass, man.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.554
It's not even
a cool party.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.222
I'm sorry, and yes,
you are right.

27:20.264 --> 27:21.265
I'm Max Miller's wife.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.267
If you give me
a half hour,

27:23.309 --> 27:24.435
I will make this
the most kick-ass party

27:24.477 --> 27:25.852
you've ever seen in your life,

27:25.894 --> 27:28.897
and you will be begging to
invest in my husband's company.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.193
Well, you're hot,

27:33.235 --> 27:34.194
so okay.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.780
Lovely, okay.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.994
Hey.
Hey.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.912
I brought the party down here,

27:43.954 --> 27:47.082
which is apparently where
they keep all the good stuff.

27:47.124 --> 27:50.085
No, I'm good, thanks.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.004
You okay?

27:52.045 --> 27:54.840
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.759
I thought Liam and I had
something real,

27:57.801 --> 27:59.719
but if he's already back
with Vanessa,

27:59.761 --> 28:02.640
then I guess I didn't mean
anything to him.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.016
He's an idiot.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.852
(chuckles)

28:06.893 --> 28:09.146
You always know
just what to say.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.440
(both chuckle)

28:12.858 --> 28:15.361
You're like, you're
like a chiseled god.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.529
Did you know that?

28:16.570 --> 28:19.239
I mean, you are so beautiful.

28:19.281 --> 28:20.658
Look who's talking, huh?

28:20.698 --> 28:23.785
Our baby is going to be
impossibly good-looking.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.120
Oh, yeah.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.415
(sighs)

28:33.379 --> 28:35.339
What are you doing?

28:35.381 --> 28:38.008
Sorry, I thought
we were having a moment.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.969
I came down here to comfort
you, not come on to you.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.012
(sighs)

28:42.054 --> 28:43.972
Thought you kind of
understood I'm gay.

28:44.014 --> 28:46.433
I know, I know,

28:46.475 --> 28:48.894
but, you know, you were gay
when we were together

28:48.935 --> 28:50.103
and that didn't stop you.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.398
No, of course it didn't.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.442
I was trying to convince
myself I was straight.

28:59.029 --> 29:01.114
Yeah.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.453
I'm sorry, I di...
I didn't mean it like that.

29:06.495 --> 29:07.663
(sighs)

29:07.705 --> 29:10.290
No, I get it.

29:10.332 --> 29:14.211
Being with me
was just part of a lie.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.635

I can assure you that if you
invest in my husband's company,

Liam would love to star in
your video games.

33:48.485 --> 33:49.611
Wouldn't you, Liam?

33:49.653 --> 33:50.863
Seriously?
LIAM:
Well, I...

33:50.904 --> 33:52.739
Now that would
seal the deal.

33:52.781 --> 33:55.325
Maybe.
If the terms are right.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.786
I mean, Liam's
very expensive.

33:57.828 --> 33:58.996
Who are you?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.622
His fiancée.
What?!

34:00.664 --> 34:01.707
What?

34:01.748 --> 34:03.876
I know we agreed
to wait to tell everyone,

34:03.917 --> 34:05.669
but I just got
so excited.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.174
(chuckles)
Well...

34:12.634 --> 34:14.092
Oh, my God.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.304
Dixon, are you okay?
Come on.

34:16.346 --> 34:17.304
I'm fine.

34:17.347 --> 34:19.641
Let me... Here.
All right.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.184
Dixon, damn it,

34:21.226 --> 34:24.396
I can't not
help you, okay?

34:24.437 --> 34:26.023
I swear to God,
I've been trying,

34:26.063 --> 34:27.440
but you're my brother!

34:31.570 --> 34:33.655
(sighs)

34:35.156 --> 34:37.242
When you first came
to our family,

34:37.283 --> 34:39.536
you were so small
and so scared,

34:39.578 --> 34:41.955
and from that very
first minute,

34:41.996 --> 34:45.208
I swore that I would never
let anything happen to you.

34:47.126 --> 34:53.007
Then you got hit by
that truck, and...

34:53.050 --> 34:54.467
I'm really sorry

34:54.509 --> 34:57.054
if I'm making you
feel helpless.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.681
But you have to know
that I'm only doing it

34:59.723 --> 35:01.892
because I almost lost you.

35:01.934 --> 35:06.271
I just fell out
of the chair, Annie.

35:06.312 --> 35:10.525
I was just laying there.

35:10.567 --> 35:15.363
I couldn't get my hand
do what I wanted it to.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.657
I couldn't move my leg.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.326
We will work
through this, Dixon.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.745
You're gonna be fine.

35:21.787 --> 35:25.040
What if I'm not?

35:25.082 --> 35:27.709
What if I'm not
gonna be fine, Annie?

35:27.751 --> 35:31.922
What if it takes too long,
and Ade decides not to wait?

35:33.840 --> 35:35.174
I'm a freaking charity case.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.304
No, don't ever say that.

35:39.345 --> 35:42.099
What if I never get better?

35:45.852 --> 35:48.438
What if I never get
better, Annie?

36:08.708 --> 36:10.794
Hey.
Hey.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.378
I got a ride back
with Dixon and Ade, so...

36:15.381 --> 36:17.550
Look, we never really talked
about the whole

36:17.592 --> 36:19.886
"me being gay while I was
with you" thing.

36:19.928 --> 36:24.141
We just sort of jumped ahead
to me coming out of the closet.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.475
And I supported you
unconditionally

36:25.517 --> 36:27.102
because I loved you
and wanted you to be happy.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.646
I know.

36:33.274 --> 36:35.944
I always thought that we had
something special.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.529
I guess it never
occurred to me

36:37.570 --> 36:38.697
that you were using me

36:38.738 --> 36:40.157
to pretend that
you were something else.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.368
It's not that simple.

36:47.831 --> 36:49.958
Did you ever love me?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.627
Or was that just a part
of the lie, too?

36:52.669 --> 36:54.796
Silver, I never lied to you.

36:54.838 --> 36:57.549
I was lying to myself.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.719
And how I felt? How I feel?

37:00.760 --> 37:03.388
Of course I loved you.

37:03.429 --> 37:05.807
I still do.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.350
I'm having a baby with you,
aren't I?

37:09.186 --> 37:11.604
(both chuckle)

37:11.646 --> 37:13.940
And just for the record,
if I were straight,

37:13.982 --> 37:17.235
I would never have let you go.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.248
How dare you get into
Dixon's head!

37:30.289 --> 37:32.584
Are you here to give me
a spanking?

37:32.625 --> 37:33.835
Although I wouldn't feel it,

37:33.877 --> 37:36.254
but if it'd make you feel
better, then go for it.

37:36.295 --> 37:38.256
Thanks to you, my brother pushed
himself too hard

37:38.297 --> 37:39.549
so that his girlfriend
wouldn't look

37:39.591 --> 37:41.009
at him differently,
and now he says

37:41.051 --> 37:43.428
he doesn't even see
the point in trying.
Good.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.846
What?!

37:44.888 --> 37:46.056
I was hard on Dixon
for a reason.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.766
He wasn't being realistic.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.601
He needs to accept that he's got
a long road to recovery

37:49.642 --> 37:51.352
or he's never gonna get there.

37:51.394 --> 37:54.272
You don't know what
my brother needs.
Oh, but you do?

37:54.313 --> 37:56.024
Better than you and your
half-baked psychology

37:56.066 --> 37:57.234
of the rolling injured.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.985
Really?

37:59.027 --> 38:01.529
Have you ever lost control
of your body and had no idea

38:01.571 --> 38:04.490
if it was
gonna come back, huh?

38:04.532 --> 38:07.493
Has your life ever changed
in one instant?

38:07.535 --> 38:09.079
Just completely
changed?
No.

38:09.121 --> 38:10.580
You see, you think by being
a cheerleader for Dixon

38:10.622 --> 38:11.998
that you're helping him out,

38:12.040 --> 38:14.626
but really the worst thing that
you can do for him right now

38:14.667 --> 38:16.169
is promise him
that you can be there

38:16.211 --> 38:17.462
for him no matter what,

38:17.503 --> 38:19.631
when really you don't know if
you can keep that promise.

38:19.672 --> 38:23.426
Look, I don't know who did what
to you to make you so bitter,

38:23.468 --> 38:27.931
but I'm Dixon's sister
and I'm not going anywhere.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.182
So go see a therapist

38:29.224 --> 38:30.934
if you need to work
through some things.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.936
And please, just leave us
out of your neurosis.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.152
Well, the contracts have
been signed,

38:40.193 --> 38:41.820
Liam's doing the video game,

38:41.861 --> 38:43.696
and they have agreed
to partner with us.

38:43.738 --> 38:44.739
When this hits the news,

38:44.781 --> 38:46.324
our stock price should rebound
and more.

38:46.365 --> 38:47.575
You have to admit,

38:47.617 --> 38:49.577
it looks like Naomi is
not bad for business.

38:49.619 --> 38:50.870
It sure looks that way.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.081
Well, I am just happy to help.

38:53.123 --> 38:55.750
And I don't think I've ever said
congratulations.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.460
Oh.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.129
(chuckles)

39:00.546 --> 39:02.757
Well, I don't have one
of these.

39:02.799 --> 39:05.051
A hot pot?
(Alec chuckles)

39:05.093 --> 39:07.095
When Alec and I were
starting our business,

39:07.137 --> 39:09.764
we, uh, we ate a lot of ramen.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.892
And now you two are married,
so I thought I'd pass the torch.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.769
Well, thank you.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.772
That's very sweet, man.
Thank you.

39:17.814 --> 39:21.901
Okay, Naomi and I leave
tonight for our honeymoon.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.153
A little problem.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.155
You see, I promised
you'd get on a plane to Japan

39:25.197 --> 39:27.073
right away to look
at the video game specs.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.742
The jet is standing by.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.953
Well, hey, if we're gonna
get this thing ready

39:31.995 --> 39:33.538
in time to launch
at Christmas...

39:33.579 --> 39:35.790
I know how hard Naomi worked
on making this happen.

39:35.832 --> 39:37.792
I'd hate to see it fall apart.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.880
But our honeymoon.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.923
Can wait!

39:43.965 --> 39:44.966
Don't worry about me.

39:45.008 --> 39:46.759
I want what's best
for the company.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.469
I'm married to a mogul.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.805
I'm gonna have to get used
to that.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.350
Doesn't matter that our marriage
is starting

39:53.391 --> 39:55.310
on different continents.

39:55.352 --> 39:57.770
The Miller-Clarks
are going to be just fine.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.190
The, uh, Clark-Millers.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.441
Kiss me right now.
(chuckles)

40:05.195 --> 40:07.072
Mmm.
Oh!

40:07.113 --> 40:08.489
(chuckles) Go!

40:08.531 --> 40:09.699
All right.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.119
Mmm-wa!

40:19.251 --> 40:21.460
I know you're mad,
and I probably should

40:21.502 --> 40:23.004
have waited to announce
our engagement

40:23.046 --> 40:23.963
at the party, but...

40:24.005 --> 40:25.506
Vanessa, we
are not engaged!

40:25.548 --> 40:27.717
You can blackmail me into
being in a relationship

40:27.759 --> 40:30.803
with you, or into living in
this ridiculous house with you,

40:30.845 --> 40:32.430
but I would rather go to jail

40:32.471 --> 40:34.682
for the rest of my life
than to marry you.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.518
You really hate me that much?

40:39.604 --> 40:42.648
It's Silver, isn't it?
I saw the way you looked at her.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.942
Liam, we had a deal.

40:43.983 --> 40:44.984
What do you want from me?!

40:45.026 --> 40:46.194
You're not even trying!

40:46.236 --> 40:47.195
What do you want?!

40:47.237 --> 40:48.988
I just want you to love me!

40:49.030 --> 40:50.407
You are completely insane!

40:50.448 --> 40:51.741
Liam, wait.
Let me go.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.619
Liam! (screams): No...!

40:54.660 --> 40:57.747
♪ ♪

41:05.422 --> 41:08.549
Yeah, uh, hi.
My name is Liam Court.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.843
Uh, I've just seen an accident.

41:26.276 --> 41:30.029
Uh, yeah, no, no.

41:30.071 --> 41:32.991
I'm sorry, I, uh...

41:33.032 --> 41:34.617
I think I made a mistake.
