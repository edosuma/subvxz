00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.041 --> 01:00.500


01:15.250 --> 01:17.875
Well, it's that time again, boys.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.041
I'm off to my weekly mustache wax.

01:25.375 --> 01:28.291
Now, remember. Two rules while I'm gone.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.916
Number one, don't touch my radio.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.583
It is my most prized object after all.

01:35.166 --> 01:39.291
And of course,
rule number two, no fighting!

01:58.583 --> 01:59.750
Hold it!

01:59.833 --> 02:02.000
Cuphead, why are we fighting again?

02:02.083 --> 02:04.333
Uh, 'cause we're not supposed to?

02:04.416 --> 02:05.250
Right!

02:09.416 --> 02:11.875
Back so soon, dearest Kettle?

02:17.416 --> 02:19.833
"Please take care of baby."

02:25.750 --> 02:27.333
Aw!

02:27.416 --> 02:30.750
How could someone leave
something so precious?

02:30.833 --> 02:32.750
Uh, Mugman?

02:32.833 --> 02:35.208
What are we supposed to do with a baby?

02:35.291 --> 02:38.083
We show it love, of course.
Just watch and learn.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.250
Hello, baby.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.250
My name is Mugman.

02:41.333 --> 02:42.666
Can you say Mu--

02:42.750 --> 02:43.666
Mama.

02:46.916 --> 02:50.041
That's right, baby! That's exactly right!

02:50.125 --> 02:51.708
-Boop!

02:51.791 --> 02:55.083
Well, then, I guess
that makes me Dada, doesn't it?

02:55.166 --> 02:57.083
Right? Dada?

03:02.625 --> 03:04.833
Mugman, why's it crying?

03:04.916 --> 03:06.875
You need to burp him, Cuphead!

03:08.958 --> 03:12.291
-I don't think it's working.
-Maybe he needs his diaper changed?

03:13.250 --> 03:17.208
-Or I could try burping him again.
-Yeah, that's a great idea.

03:17.791 --> 03:19.916
-It's all right, baby.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.833
Yeah. That's better.

03:22.916 --> 03:23.791
Mama!

03:23.875 --> 03:25.208
Hey, it worked!

03:25.291 --> 03:26.125
Boop!

03:29.416 --> 03:31.916
Did you see that?! That thing bit me!

03:32.000 --> 03:34.875
Cuphead! Baby is not a "thing."

03:34.958 --> 03:36.291
Baby is a baby.

03:37.625 --> 03:42.083
I think you two need to learn to get along
while I prepare some baby food.

03:43.708 --> 03:44.791
And now, remember!

03:44.875 --> 03:48.125
All baby needs is love!

03:55.750 --> 03:58.166
Peekaboo! Peekaboo!

03:58.250 --> 03:59.333
Peekaboo!

04:09.125 --> 04:11.541
Now, baby, you know it's not polite to--

04:18.083 --> 04:19.083
Phew!

04:19.166 --> 04:20.208
Mama!

04:21.875 --> 04:22.708
Baby, no!

04:26.041 --> 04:27.208
Ow!

04:27.291 --> 04:29.125
Whee!

04:33.875 --> 04:35.666
-

04:40.833 --> 04:41.916
Baby!

04:46.500 --> 04:48.583
I just knew they'd get along.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.000
-Now, baby--

04:58.250 --> 04:59.250
Phew!

04:59.333 --> 05:00.791
Bad baby! Bad--

05:02.083 --> 05:03.416
-Baby?
-Mama?

05:06.625 --> 05:07.875
Don't do it.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.625
Easy…

05:12.208 --> 05:13.625
Easy…

05:19.166 --> 05:21.041
Oh, come on!

05:21.125 --> 05:25.208
Cuphead! Glass on the floor?!
Baby could get hurt!

05:25.291 --> 05:27.833
Well, baby broke the fish bowl!

05:27.916 --> 05:30.333
You were supposed to be watching baby!

05:30.416 --> 05:32.416
That baby is not a normal--

05:32.916 --> 05:34.375
Wait. Where's baby?

05:37.125 --> 05:37.958
Baby!

05:39.083 --> 05:40.083
Where'd it go?!

05:40.583 --> 05:41.916
How should I know?!

05:45.125 --> 05:45.958


05:46.041 --> 05:47.500
There you are.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.750
Open up, baby!

05:52.833 --> 05:54.000
Open the door!

05:54.083 --> 05:55.458
You gotta listen to me.

05:55.541 --> 05:58.125
Something's wrong with that baby.
We gotta get rid of it.

05:58.208 --> 06:01.375
Not a chance, Cuphead.
Baby needs our love!

06:01.458 --> 06:03.500
What it needs is a leash!

06:03.583 --> 06:08.500
Cuphead! The way you're talking,
it's like you never even wanted a baby!

06:08.583 --> 06:09.875
I didn't!

06:11.541 --> 06:13.416
Oh, well, then…

06:13.500 --> 06:16.250
I guess I'll do all the parenting myself.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.625
Be my guest! Hmph!

06:19.791 --> 06:24.041
Baby? Would you be a darling
and open the door for Mama?

06:27.291 --> 06:29.416
Elder Kettle's radio!

06:41.916 --> 06:44.166
-No! Bad baby! Bad!

06:48.291 --> 06:50.166
Mama.

06:50.250 --> 06:53.083
Uh, I don't like
that crazy glint in his eye.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.083
Oh, nonsense, Cuphead.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.166
-But--
-Calm down.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.791
Wait right there.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.625
I've had this bear
since I was a tiny baby.

07:06.708 --> 07:08.625
It means the world to me.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.583
It was always there to cheer me up,

07:13.666 --> 07:16.750
and now it'll be there for you.

07:28.375 --> 07:30.625
I'm gonna kill that thing!

07:30.708 --> 07:32.416
Mugman, no! It's a baby!

07:32.500 --> 07:33.875
It's not a baby!

07:33.958 --> 07:36.208
-It's evil.

07:36.958 --> 07:37.958
It's gone!

07:51.791 --> 07:52.625
My eyes!

07:54.583 --> 07:55.416


07:59.125 --> 08:00.750
That's it! I'm calling for help.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.166
Hello, Operator? Get me the police!

08:03.666 --> 08:04.833
Hello? Hello?

08:07.333 --> 08:08.833
He cut the line!

08:10.875 --> 08:11.875


08:11.958 --> 08:13.375


08:13.958 --> 08:15.500


08:28.250 --> 08:29.958
Now what do we do?!

08:30.041 --> 08:31.166
-Dresser.
-Huh?

08:31.250 --> 08:32.083
Dresser!

08:36.625 --> 08:38.541
-Chair.
-No. Dresser.

08:38.625 --> 08:39.833
No, chair!

08:41.000 --> 08:41.833
Whoa!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.416
Baby, no!

08:54.500 --> 08:55.333
Mama!

08:55.875 --> 08:57.083
No!

09:01.958 --> 09:02.791
Whoa!

09:03.375 --> 09:04.333
Huh?

09:04.416 --> 09:06.791
Door ripped off its hinges?

09:06.875 --> 09:08.250
Piano on fire?

09:08.333 --> 09:10.833
Fishbowl shattered? Fish missing?

09:10.916 --> 09:13.125
Antique china in pieces?

09:13.208 --> 09:15.541
Dresser smashed into wall?

09:15.625 --> 09:16.875
More fire?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.958
Eh. Boys will be boys.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.916
My radio!

09:24.000 --> 09:26.458
My most prized object!

09:27.583 --> 09:28.916


09:29.000 --> 09:30.250
Baby did it.

09:32.916 --> 09:33.750
Mama.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.500
Aw!

09:37.333 --> 09:39.208
This little cutie-patootie?

09:44.625 --> 09:45.625
Oh!

09:45.708 --> 09:46.541
Bad baby!

09:47.333 --> 09:48.750
Mama.

09:53.791 --> 09:55.791
Boys! Help!

10:03.041 --> 10:05.625
Okay. On three.

10:05.708 --> 10:06.625
One,

10:07.125 --> 10:07.958
two,

10:08.958 --> 10:09.791
three!

10:15.541 --> 10:17.416
Aw!

10:22.125 --> 10:22.958
Mama.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.250
So cute!

10:25.083 --> 10:26.958
"Please take care of baby."

10:27.041 --> 10:28.083
Oh!

10:28.166 --> 10:29.500
Let's get you inside.
