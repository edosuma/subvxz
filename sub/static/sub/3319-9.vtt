Hi, I'm Bonnie,
I'm an alcoholic.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.398
GROUP:
Hi, Bonnie.

00:07.485 --> 00:10.227
I know I usually use this forum

00:10.314 --> 00:13.013
to talk about
my romantic travails.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.886
AKA "fellatio."

00:16.973 --> 00:20.716
But that's not what
I'm struggling with right now.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.935
Five bucks says
she's got the clap.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.677
[clears throat]

00:25.764 --> 00:27.853
The thing is, I...

00:27.940 --> 00:30.334
lost my job,
and I'm really scared.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.249
I was just barely

00:32.336 --> 00:34.208
making ends meet, before.

00:34.295 --> 00:37.080
But now, I just, I don't know.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.648
And guess who didn't save
anything for a rainy day?

00:41.345 --> 00:43.043
Well, it's not
my fault, really.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.522
I mean,

00:44.609 --> 00:45.219
who knew I was
gonna live this long?

00:45.306 --> 00:47.003
Not me.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.657
Or the paramedic who
jump-started my heart

00:48.744 --> 00:49.005
at Burning Man.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.183
All I know is I been coming
around here for two years,

00:53.270 --> 00:57.318
taking suggestions, trying
to be a "better person," and...

00:57.405 --> 00:59.233
feels like my life
is worse than ever.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.408
Thanks for letting me share.

01:00.495 --> 01:04.890
She still could
have the clap.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.473
I am craving a Cobb salad.
What are you getting?

01:22.560 --> 01:25.694
I was just gonna
get some tea.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.435
Do you want
to talk about this?

01:27.522 --> 01:28.523
What's to talk?
It's Cobb salad.

01:30.525 --> 01:33.354
Bonnie, your daughter
is concerned about you.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.572
Oh? Why?

01:34.659 --> 01:36.270
You lost your job.

01:36.357 --> 01:38.750
And didn't perform
any other kind of jobs.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.013
Don't like you.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.233
Don't like you, back.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.802
Well, you can all stop
worrying. I'm doing fine.MARJORIE: Hmm.

01:46.889 --> 01:49.283
You know what fine
stands for, don't you?

01:49.370 --> 01:53.809
F-I-N-E: Frustrated, Insecure,
Neurotic and Emotional.

01:53.896 --> 01:58.205
Wow, does everyone want to
strangle you, or just me?

01:58.292 --> 02:00.859
Bonnie, you have
to get honest.

02:00.946 --> 02:04.036
Humble, Open,
Non-judgmental...

02:04.124 --> 02:06.213
Shut it.[quietly]: ...Egoless,
Spiritual and Trusting.

02:08.693 --> 02:09.607
CHRISTY: Mom,

02:09.693 --> 02:10.869
we're just trying to help.

02:10.955 --> 02:12.480
But you can't help me.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.482
Do you know how hard
it is in this economy

02:14.569 --> 02:16.397
for a woman over
40 to get a job?

02:16.484 --> 02:18.050
Oh, who the hell
are you kidding?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.052
You're closer
to deaththan 40.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.926
Tread lightly, Oprah.

02:25.928 --> 02:28.496
You know, sometimes,
when I'm having a hard time,

02:28.583 --> 02:31.020
what gets me through
is finding someone

02:31.107 --> 02:33.588
who's worse off
than me and helping them.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.156
Call the Pope,
we have a saint.

02:38.288 --> 02:39.463
Look, I am touched

02:39.550 --> 02:41.030
that you're all
concerned about me,

02:41.117 --> 02:42.814
but I don't think
anyone here

02:42.901 --> 02:44.381
is in a position
to offer advice.

02:44.468 --> 02:45.730
Certainly not
from the woman

02:45.817 --> 02:47.254
who has four cats
in her will.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.519
Hey, you know what
"CAT" stands for, right?

02:51.606 --> 02:52.694
Crazy, Annoying, Twit.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.612
And you're out on bail.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.267
You've been sober for,
what, half an hour?

03:00.354 --> 03:02.356
Please, shine a light
on my darkness.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.315
Take me to the river.

03:05.402 --> 03:07.883
I don't have to sit
here and be abused.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.580
Regina?

03:09.667 --> 03:10.886
One of these days,

03:10.973 --> 03:11.539
you and me are gonna throw down.

03:11.626 --> 03:12.540
Hard.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.629
Ooh.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.591
[exhales]

03:20.678 --> 03:22.463
I'm gonna go out on a limb

03:22.550 --> 03:24.247
and say you didn't
lose your job

03:24.334 --> 03:26.293
because of the economy.

03:32.603 --> 03:35.084
I can't find my jeans.

03:35.171 --> 03:38.218
I'm wearing them. None of mine
fit me because of yourbaby.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.655
How come it's mybaby
when it makes youfart

03:40.742 --> 03:42.047
and not fit in your pants?

03:43.658 --> 03:44.615
Hey.

03:44.702 --> 03:47.227
Hey.Welcome home.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.491
Why aren't you wearing pants?

03:50.578 --> 03:52.144
Oh, because I'm a good father.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.538
Go put something on.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.061
Well, but, she's got my...Go.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.585
I'm seeing shapes.
I can't see shapes.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.329
You're in a mood.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.504
Sorry.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.201
I'm upset about your grandma.

04:05.288 --> 04:06.550
You guys get in an argument?

04:06.637 --> 04:08.204
I don't know.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.727
She lost her job, but...

04:09.814 --> 04:12.513
[sighs]
something else is going on.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.254
I'm really worried.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.125
Now you know how I felt
for the last ten years.

04:16.212 --> 04:19.302
What are you talking about?You want me to walk you through

04:19.389 --> 04:21.478
what it was like around here
when you were drinking?

04:21.565 --> 04:22.566
That's okay.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.002
Save it for therapy.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.048
Which Mommy will pay for.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.921
Don't say a word.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.145
Luke's parents can
pay for histherapy.

04:41.846 --> 04:44.240
[tapping on glass]

04:51.029 --> 04:51.987
Mom?

04:52.074 --> 04:54.076
Hidey-ho.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.994
[grunts]

05:00.256 --> 05:01.692
What are you doing
out there?

05:01.779 --> 05:03.955
Skipping out on a taxi.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.653
Get out of my way.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.524
Well, well, let me,
let me help you.I got it.

05:07.611 --> 05:08.656
Careful.I got it, I got it.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.571
Careful, oh...[loud thud]

05:10.658 --> 05:12.573
What happened?

05:14.009 --> 05:17.012
Come on, get up.
Get up.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.143
[exhales]

05:19.493 --> 05:20.450
Have you been drinking?

05:20.537 --> 05:21.973
No, no.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.976
Maybe a little.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.109
Mom, why?

05:27.196 --> 05:28.763
You've just thrown
two years out the window.

05:28.850 --> 05:32.593
And then I climbed
back inthe window.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.073
You're a tough audience.

05:36.684 --> 05:39.121
Is this because
you lost your job?

05:39.208 --> 05:39.817
And my apartment.

05:39.904 --> 05:41.776
And my car.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.081
Well, nobody
actually took that,

05:43.168 --> 05:44.866
I just can't find it.

05:44.953 --> 05:46.781
Wait, you lost your apartment?

05:46.868 --> 05:49.653
The bastards require rent
every month,it's ridiculous.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.395
Oh, God.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.484
Can I live with you awhile?

05:54.571 --> 05:55.790
You know, just till
I get it together?

05:56.878 --> 05:59.489
Yeah, I guess.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.751
Thanks.

06:00.838 --> 06:01.752
You won't even know I'm here.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.713
Mom?

06:05.800 --> 06:06.975
Shh.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.716
I'm peeing.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.370
Oh, no, no.
No-no-no.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.501
No-no-no-no-no.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.285
No, no, no, no, no.Hold on.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.678
Where we going?
Where we going?

06:14.765 --> 06:15.984
Bathroom.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.207
You finish your
book report?

06:22.294 --> 06:23.252
Yup.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.253
Did you read the book?

06:24.340 --> 06:25.863
Whose side are you on?

06:27.735 --> 06:29.389
[vomiting]

06:29.476 --> 06:30.607
CHRISTY:
Ah!

06:30.694 --> 06:31.739
I forgot to tell you:

06:31.826 --> 06:33.349
Grandma's here.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.786
She doesn't sound so good.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.875
[sighs][toilet flushes]

06:37.962 --> 06:39.964
Wait till you see her.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.668
Morning, all.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.191
Holy crap.

06:49.278 --> 06:53.369
Be nice to me or I'll kiss you.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.197
Why do you look like a zombie?

06:55.284 --> 06:57.808
Because I'm dead inside.

06:57.895 --> 07:01.246
Okeydokey, let's get
you ready for school.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.823
Look at you,
getting all fat.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.743
All right,
I got to get to work.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.702
You gonna be okay?

07:21.789 --> 07:24.269
Yeah.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.881
When was the last time
you ate something?

07:26.968 --> 07:28.622
I'm not sure.

07:28.709 --> 07:28.883
I threw up some pasta.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.799
I know.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.583
You can't just
keep drinking coffee.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.280
You've got to put
something in your stomach.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.065
Maybe later.

07:37.152 --> 07:37.892
Will you bring me back some
soup from the restaurant?

07:37.979 --> 07:39.894
Sure.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.113
I'm so sorry.

07:42.200 --> 07:42.940
Yeah, whatever.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.638
Oh, come on.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.117
What do you want me to say?

07:46.204 --> 07:47.945
I don't want you
to say anything.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.904
I have been listening
to your apologies all my life.

07:49.991 --> 07:53.864
"I'm sorry I snuck you out of
the country in a pet carrier."

07:53.951 --> 07:58.739
"I'm sorry we lived in
a commune in Argentina."

07:58.826 --> 08:01.350
"I'm sorry I accidentally
left you in Argentina."

08:02.743 --> 08:05.006
But this apology is different.

08:05.093 --> 08:05.963
I really mean it this time.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.356
Is that so?

08:07.443 --> 08:09.880
I never want
to feel like this again.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.882
I will do anything to get sober.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.275
Anything?

08:13.362 --> 08:15.930
Whatever it takes,
I am so ready.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.106
[knocking]That's good.

08:18.193 --> 08:21.022
'Cause I invited a couple
friends over to help out.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.371
Come on in.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.851
No, no!

08:23.938 --> 08:25.983
Not them.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.419
Anything
but them.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.205
You peed in the bed,
now lie in it.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.470
It's time to heal,
Bonnie.

08:34.557 --> 08:35.340
Health, Energy,

08:35.427 --> 08:38.429
Abstinence and Love.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.431
Screw that.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.563
You're mine, bitch.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.397
You want to start?

08:48.484 --> 08:49.703
No.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.269
Okay, I'll go first.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.272
Hi, I'm Marjorie,
I'm an alcoholic.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.404
Hi, Marjorie.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.406
Oh, bite me.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.629
It's been 32 years
since my last drink.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.413
And 14 years since
your last orgasm.

09:06.154 --> 09:06.720
[laughs]

09:06.807 --> 09:08.852
Hey.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.114
Sorry, it was funny.

09:11.942 --> 09:16.425
I got rolling with drugs
and alcohol during the '60s.

09:16.512 --> 09:17.818
I was living in San Francisco.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.734
You know, the whole
hippie thing.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.693
Free love, end the war, heroin.

09:23.780 --> 09:24.738
Heroin?

09:24.825 --> 09:27.349
Just nights and weekends.

09:29.873 --> 09:33.790
Long story short,
1981-- I look around--

09:33.877 --> 09:35.836
all the hippies
have gone back to school

09:35.923 --> 09:39.274
or got jobs, bought condos.

09:39.361 --> 09:42.364
And I'm a homeless bag lady
living in Golden Gate Park.

09:43.626 --> 09:44.627
Okay.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.063
You got my attention.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.935
I didn't want to live anymore.

09:48.022 --> 09:50.328
And, despite my best efforts,
I didn't know how to die.

09:50.415 --> 09:53.157
So I went
to a meeting

09:53.244 --> 09:55.333
'cause they had free cookies,
and somebody told a story

09:55.420 --> 09:59.207
that made me
look like Princess Grace.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.339
So I stuck around,

10:01.426 --> 10:03.298
got a job, got teeth,

10:03.385 --> 10:05.605
got a husband.

10:05.692 --> 10:06.780
In that order.

10:09.086 --> 10:13.656
32 years later, I am still
very grateful to be sober.

10:13.743 --> 10:16.572
Regina?

10:16.659 --> 10:17.834
Oh, okay.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.488
Come on, heroin?

10:21.577 --> 10:24.232
You got to be really high
to rob banks.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.148
Wow.

10:27.235 --> 10:27.627
You think you know someone.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.457
[sighs]
Regina. Alcoholic.

10:32.544 --> 10:33.807
Hi, Regina.Hi, Regina.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.112
[chuckles]

10:35.199 --> 10:36.766
Well, let's see, uh...

10:36.853 --> 10:38.594
I'm going through a divorce.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.075
My kid's not talking to me.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.468
I'm working at a supermarket
bagging groceries.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.340
I've been indicted
for embezzling

10:45.427 --> 10:48.648
$3.5 million,
I'm probably going to jail.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.519
And I'm terrified.

10:50.606 --> 10:53.609
But the good news is,
due to recent events,

10:53.696 --> 10:55.655
I'm doing better
than you.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.353
Bonnie.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.615
Thank you, Regina.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.012
[sighs]

11:05.099 --> 11:08.232
Hi. I'm Bonnie.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.756
I'm an alcoholic.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.496
MARJORIE AND REGINA:
Hi, Bonnie.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.629
I've been sober for...

11:13.716 --> 11:16.240
Oh, man, where's my watch?

11:19.374 --> 11:22.290
Well... not long.

11:22.377 --> 11:25.554
Anyway, I started drinking
when I was 15, 16 years old.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.166
In the foster care system,

11:29.253 --> 11:31.168
getting bounced around
from house to house.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.607
Teenage kids aren't
real desirable.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.436
Especially when they steal
your kitchen appliances.

11:38.523 --> 11:42.049
I met this...

11:42.136 --> 11:44.138
really cool guy.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.707
Sold him a microwave
at a flea market.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.883
[clears throat]

11:49.970 --> 11:52.668
We fell in love
and ran off together,

11:52.755 --> 11:56.454
had Christy,
then he ran off alone.

12:05.681 --> 12:09.293
And... I...

12:10.860 --> 12:13.080
And, uh...

12:13.167 --> 12:14.690
[groans]

12:14.777 --> 12:17.911
[voice breaking]:
I tried to be a good single mom,

12:17.998 --> 12:20.652
but as we all know,
I didn't exactly nail it.

12:23.438 --> 12:24.656
But I tried.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.791
And I'm still trying.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.272
But then, this morning,

12:31.359 --> 12:32.534
when I saw the look
of disappointment

12:32.621 --> 12:35.755
on Christy's face, it just...

12:35.842 --> 12:38.627
reminded me of all the times
that I let her down.

12:38.714 --> 12:42.196
[crying]

12:44.851 --> 12:46.809
Damn.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.161
I got to fix this. Yeah.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.511
I got to fix this right now.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.776
Wait. Where are you going?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.995
I got to apologize
to my baby girl.

12:59.822 --> 12:59.909
Oh...

13:02.869 --> 13:04.871
Oh, damn. She took mykeys.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.916
[engine revving,
tires squeak]

13:08.570 --> 13:10.485
Are we done?

13:10.572 --> 13:12.574
Can I go home?

13:18.536 --> 13:20.451
Oh! My halibut's
not ready yet?

13:20.538 --> 13:22.192
Chef Rudy, what is going on?

13:22.279 --> 13:23.585
People are waiting 45 minutes
for their entrees.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.544
It's cool.

13:26.631 --> 13:30.070
Oh, God, is everyone
in my life getting loaded?

13:32.986 --> 13:34.726
What the hell is
going on in here?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.512
Ask Snoop Dogg and Dre.

13:37.599 --> 13:41.559
You're smoking dope?

13:41.646 --> 13:43.300
Yeah. You want a hit?

13:43.387 --> 13:44.824
Sure.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.828
Your halibut will be up
in a minute.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.743
I brought you another glass
of wine, just for the "halibut."

13:51.831 --> 13:54.050
[laughs]

13:54.137 --> 13:55.660
There's my baby.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.358
Oh, my... oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

13:57.445 --> 14:00.013
I have been a terrible
mother to you.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.971
Yeah, the worst. Why don't
we talk about it at home?

14:02.058 --> 14:05.148
Well, you-you need to know that
I will never let you down again.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.671
I got it. Message received.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.238
I have to get
back to work.
No.

14:08.325 --> 14:09.892
You have worked enough.
Let me lighten your load.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.372
Okay, it's not a
load, Mom. It's...

14:11.459 --> 14:15.158
Hi. I'm Bonnie.
I'll be your server. Hi.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.638
Why, you folks don't
have any bread.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.553
Why don't I go get you some?

14:20.076 --> 14:21.599
Mom? Mom?!

14:21.686 --> 14:23.601
Ooh! Ooh!

14:23.688 --> 14:25.603
Son of a bitch!

14:25.690 --> 14:29.477
This is good weed.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.872
I couldn't find any bread,
so I brought you another candle.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.919
Come on, Bonnie.
Time to go home.

14:37.006 --> 14:37.659
I can't. I'm working.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.791
Mom, please.

14:42.664 --> 14:45.014
Let's dance.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.547
[slow-motion grunt]

14:56.634 --> 14:57.722
[thudding]

15:03.293 --> 15:05.643
You're gonna do
fine in jail.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.824
And as long as I'm coming clean,

15:12.912 --> 15:14.435
I might as well tell you

15:14.522 --> 15:16.263
I've been getting loaded
for a couple of months.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.917
And you flushed my
drugs down the toilet?!

15:18.004 --> 15:20.963
Don't be silly.
I enjoyed them greatly.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.662
Anyhow, it's time I got honest.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.795
Yeah, yeah, humble, open,
beep-bop-boop.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.800
And I... I want
to thank Christy

15:31.887 --> 15:36.022
for being the greatest
daughter in the world,

15:36.109 --> 15:37.806
even though I wasn't exactly
mother of the year.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.896
[scoffs]
Sorry.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.725
But most important,

15:43.812 --> 15:46.728
I am ready to do this program
for real now,

15:46.815 --> 15:49.731
and not just for myself.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.776
But because...

15:51.863 --> 15:55.389
I never want
to let you down again.

15:55.476 --> 15:56.825
I also have to thank Marjorie

15:56.912 --> 16:00.394
and Michael Strahan here.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.613
I know we've had
our differences,

16:02.700 --> 16:05.442
but... I do love you guys.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.313
[whispering]:
Who's Michael Strahan?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.880
I'll tell ya later.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.839
That's it. Thanks.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.710
Thanks, Bonnie.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.843
Hi. I'm Christy.
I'm an alcoholic.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.932
GROUP:
Hi, Christy.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.852
I am so pissed
off at you!

16:23.939 --> 16:25.941
I mean, how many times do I have
to clean up your freakin' mess?!

16:26.028 --> 16:29.249
You want to be my mother? Then
stop apologizing and step up!

16:29.336 --> 16:31.077
'Cause Marjorie's applied
for the job,

16:31.164 --> 16:33.644
and that old, toothless junkie's
looking damn good right now!

16:33.731 --> 16:36.299
Thanks, sweetie.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.346
So,

16:39.433 --> 16:43.045
anyway, just wanted
to get that off my chest.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.308
Love you, Mom.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.702
You are so lucky
to have her as a daughter.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.008
Oh, what would you know?

16:51.662 --> 16:53.186
[gasps]
Oh, no.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.926
No, no, no, no.

16:59.714 --> 17:02.238
I just want you to know
that I heard you loud and clear

17:02.325 --> 17:04.719
in the meeting and until
I get back on my feet,

17:04.806 --> 17:09.419
my job is going to be making
your life as easy as possible.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.769
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

17:11.856 --> 17:17.471
No, don't feel guilty.
I want to do this.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.038
I'll take care of Roscoe,

17:19.125 --> 17:21.431
I'll clean the house,
I'll run errands.

17:21.518 --> 17:24.694
You know,
as soon as I find my car.

17:24.781 --> 17:26.784
That would be a big help.

17:26.871 --> 17:29.222
And then, when Violet has the
baby, I can do a lot for her.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.137
You know, change diapers,
night nurse.

17:31.224 --> 17:34.140
Hey, wet nurse,
if I get lucky.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.751
The baby's not due
for five months.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.927
How long you planning
on staying?

17:39.014 --> 17:40.755
Oh, don't worry, I'll know
when I've worn out my welcome.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.847
I'll know sooner.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.763
So, what's the plan?

17:48.850 --> 17:51.244
You going to start looking
for a job tomorrow?

17:51.331 --> 17:53.202
Don't need to.Really?

17:53.289 --> 17:54.638
You already found something?

17:54.725 --> 17:57.598
Yep, I'm going to be
a life coach.

17:57.685 --> 17:58.990
I'm sorry, what?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.296
My hard-won experience
can help people

18:00.383 --> 18:02.820
overcome the obsticles
in their lives,

18:02.907 --> 18:05.084
and then together, we create
a game plan for success

18:05.171 --> 18:07.782
and blobity, blah,
blah, ca-ching.

18:07.869 --> 18:11.090
Hmm, and you don't see
any credibility issues

18:11.177 --> 18:15.659
with you being broke,
homeless and one day sober?

18:15.746 --> 18:18.880
Eh, I'm not going to put that
in the brochure.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.578
Come on, try me out.

18:21.665 --> 18:22.884
Your life-- what's wrong?

18:22.971 --> 18:25.495
All right.

18:25.582 --> 18:28.455
My mother is sleeping
in my living room.

18:28.542 --> 18:29.847
Easy. Remember
that for nine months,

18:29.934 --> 18:33.112
you were sleeping
in her living womb.

18:35.331 --> 18:36.898
See what I did there?

18:36.985 --> 18:39.596
Next.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.862
[sighs]
My teenaged daughter
is pregnant...

18:44.949 --> 18:47.126
Ah.
and she might run off

18:47.213 --> 18:49.215
to live with her
knucklehead boyfriend.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.347
Well, first off,
you need to keep in mind

18:51.434 --> 18:53.523
that every baby
that comes into the world

18:53.610 --> 18:55.090
is a blessing from God.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.614
And secondly,
if she does run off,

18:57.701 --> 18:59.486
a bed just freed up
for you mom.

19:01.531 --> 19:02.967
[sighs]

19:03.054 --> 19:04.839
Okay, here's a biggie.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.797
Okay.

19:06.884 --> 19:11.672
How do I forgive a woman how has
disappointed me again and again?

19:11.759 --> 19:12.890
Well, if you had
a lick of sense,

19:12.977 --> 19:14.370
you'd stop counting on her.
