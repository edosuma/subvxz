00:01.300 --> 00:02.619
Previously on Hannibal

00:02.670 --> 00:04.661
- You make jumps
you can't explain, Will.

00:04.700 --> 00:08.067
- The evidence explains.
- Then help me find
some evidence.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.103
- I wouldn't put him out there!
- Should he get too close,
I need you to make sure

00:11.140 --> 00:14.678
he's not out there alone.
- I don't think the Shrike
killed that girl in the field.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.201
This girl's killer thought
that she was a pig.

00:17.250 --> 00:21.243
- You think this was a copycat?
- I think I can help good Will
see his face.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.748
- Hello?
- They know.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.781
(gunshots)

00:26.560 --> 00:28.710
- You said he wouldn't get
too close.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.456
- See?

00:38.370 --> 00:44.366
(gunshots)

01:07.130 --> 01:09.826
(Hobbs' daughter gasping)

01:09.870 --> 01:11.497
- (Hobbs): See?

01:11.530 --> 01:14.465
(Hobbs' daughter gasping)
See?

01:21.310 --> 01:23.107
- We're here.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.483
(police radio chatter)

02:40.790 --> 02:42.451
- Could be

02:42.490 --> 02:46.221
a permanent installation
in your Evil Minds Museum.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.899
- Well, what we learn
about Garrett Jacob Hobbs will

02:48.930 --> 02:51.364
help us catch the next one
like him.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.631
There's still seven bodies
unaccounted for.

02:54.670 --> 02:57.503
- Yeah, well,
he was eating them.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.770
- Had to be some parts
he wasn't eating.

02:59.810 --> 03:03.268
- Not necessarily.

03:03.310 --> 03:06.939
- All right, what if Hobbs
wasn't eating alone?
It's a lot of work.

03:06.980 --> 03:09.778
Disappearing these girls,
butchering them, and then

03:09.820 --> 03:12.380
not leaving a shred of anything
other than what's in this room.

03:12.420 --> 03:15.287
- Someone he hunted with.
- Someone who IS In a coma,

03:15.320 --> 03:19.324
who also happened to be someone
he hunted with.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.308
- Abigail Hobbs is a suspect?

03:32.340 --> 03:34.706
- We've been conducting
house-to-house interviews

03:34.740 --> 03:38.346
at the Hobbs residence,
and, uh, at this property also.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.338
Hobbs spent a lot of time here.
Spent a lot of time

03:45.390 --> 03:46.755
with his daughter here.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.883
She would make the ideal bait,
wouldn't she?

03:48.920 --> 03:51.480
- Hobbs killed alone.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.538
Ah. Someone else was here.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.909
(applause)

05:16.950 --> 05:18.906
- Thank you.

05:18.950 --> 05:20.941
Please stop that.

05:32.130 --> 05:35.554
This is how I caught
Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.967
It's his resignation letter.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.332
Does anybody see the clue?

05:44.770 --> 05:46.101
There isn't one.

05:46.140 --> 05:47.835
He wrote a letter,

05:47.880 --> 05:51.839
he left a phone number,
no address. That's it.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.849
Bad bookkeeping and dumb luck.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.891
(gasping)

06:16.570 --> 06:20.609
how to stop those
his story is going to inspire.

06:20.640 --> 06:25.145
(projector click)
He's already got one admirer.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.819
A copycat.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.065
Hi.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.136
- How are you, Will?

06:48.170 --> 06:52.038
- Uh, I have no idea.

06:52.070 --> 06:54.038
- Um, I didn't want you
to be ambushed.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.877
- This is an ambush?

06:55.910 --> 06:57.468
- Ambush is later.

06:57.510 --> 06:59.740
Immediately later--
soon to now.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.873
When Jack arrives,
consider yourself ambushed.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.740
- Here's Jack.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.588
- How was class?
- Um, they applauded.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.986
It was inappropriate.
- Well, the review board would

07:09.020 --> 07:12.490
beg to differ. You're up for a
commendation. And they've, uh,

07:12.530 --> 07:14.589
okayed active return
to the field.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.120
- The question is,

07:16.160 --> 07:19.493
do you want to go back
to the field?

07:19.540 --> 07:21.963
- I want him back
in the field.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.901
And I've told the board
I'm recommending a psych eval.

07:24.940 --> 07:27.909
- Are we starting now?

07:27.940 --> 07:30.170
- Oh, the session wouldn't be
with me.

07:30.210 --> 07:33.919
- Hannibal Lecter's a better
fit. Your relationship's
not personal.

07:33.950 --> 07:36.919
But if you are more comfortable
with Dr. Bloom...

07:36.950 --> 07:39.919
- I'm not comfortable with
anybody inside my head.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.179
- You've never killed anyone
before, Will.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.790
It's a deadly force encounter.
It's a lot to digest.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.559
- I used to work Homicide.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.898
- The reason you currently
USED to work Homicide is because

07:49.930 --> 07:52.694
you didn't have the stomach
for pulling the trigger.

07:52.740 --> 07:55.937
You just pulled the trigger
10 times.

07:55.970 --> 07:59.030
- Wait, so a psych eval isn't
a formality?

07:59.070 --> 08:01.903
- No, it's so I can get
some sleep at night. I asked you

08:01.940 --> 08:04.204
to get close to the Hobbs thing.
I need to know you didn't get

08:04.250 --> 08:07.674
too close. How many nights did
you spend in Abigail Hobbs'

08:07.720 --> 08:09.711
hospital room, Will?

08:12.590 --> 08:14.581
- Therapy doesn't work on me.

08:17.890 --> 08:22.224
- Therapy doesn't work on you
because you won't let it.
- And because I know

08:22.260 --> 08:25.525
all the tricks.
- Well, perhaps you need
to un-learn some tricks.

08:25.570 --> 08:27.697
- Why not have a conversation
with Hannibal?

08:27.740 --> 08:30.732
He was there. He knows
what you went through.

08:33.110 --> 08:35.203
- Come on, Will.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.970
I need my beauty sleep!

08:47.860 --> 08:49.680
- What's that?

08:49.730 --> 08:54.258
- Your psychological evaluation.
You are totally functional and

08:54.300 --> 08:56.825
more or less sane. Well done.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.691
- Did you just rubber stamp me?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.890
- Yes. Jack Crawford may lay his

09:01.940 --> 09:04.033
weary head to rest
knowing he didn't break you

09:04.070 --> 09:06.777
and our conversation can proceed
unobstructed by paperwork.

09:09.780 --> 09:13.147
- Jack thinks
that I need therapy.

09:13.180 --> 09:17.719
- What you need is
a way out of dark places
when Jack sends you there.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.786
- Last time he sent me
Into a dark place,

09:19.820 --> 09:21.253
I brought something back.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.827
- A surrogate daughter?

09:27.100 --> 09:29.921
You saved Abigail Hobbs' life.
You also orphaned her.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.188
That comes with certain
emotional obligations,

09:32.230 --> 09:34.937
regardless of empathy disorders.
- You were there.

09:34.970 --> 09:37.200
You saved her life too.
Do you feel obligated?

09:39.210 --> 09:41.269
- Yes.

09:41.310 --> 09:44.871
I feel a staggering amount
of obligation.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.912
I feel responsibility.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.787
I've fantasized about scenarios
where my actions may have

09:51.820 --> 09:53.959
allowed a different fate
for Abigail Hobbs.

09:58.730 --> 10:01.949
- Jack thinks Abigail Hobbs
helped her dad kill those girls.

10:04.830 --> 10:06.798
- How does that make you feel?

10:06.840 --> 10:08.967
- How does it make you feel?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.060
- I find it vulgar.
- Me too.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.975
- And entirely possible.

10:14.010 --> 10:16.808
- It's not what happened.
- Jack will ask her

10:16.850 --> 10:19.171
when she wakes up, or he'll have
one of us ask her.

10:19.210 --> 10:21.974
- Is this therapy,
or a support group?

10:22.020 --> 10:25.945
- It's whatever you need it
to be.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.780
And, Will,

10:29.830 --> 10:32.924
the mirrors in your mind can
reflect the best of yourself,

10:32.960 --> 10:35.019
not the worst of someone else.

10:58.150 --> 11:00.755
What is that?

11:02.760 --> 11:04.318
- I bet it's marijuana.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.852
- Mushrooms. Look, they got
tubes to water 'em or something.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.424
- No, it's a marijuana plant.

11:13.770 --> 11:15.897
- That's not marijuana.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.761
(gunshots)

11:51.510 --> 11:53.375
- I'm pretty sure

11:53.410 --> 11:56.379
firearm accuracy isn't
a prerequisite for teaching.

11:56.410 --> 11:58.446
- Well, I've been
in the field before.

11:58.480 --> 12:03.281
- Now you're back
in the saddle. Ish.
-Ishindeed.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.414
Took me 10 shots
to drop Hobbs.

12:06.450 --> 12:09.954
- Zeller wanted to give you
the bullets he pulled out of
Hobbs in an acrylic case, but

12:09.990 --> 12:12.151
I told him you wouldn't
think it was funny.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.125
- Probably not.
- I suggested one of those

12:15.160 --> 12:17.390
clackin' swingin'
ball things.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.991
- That would've
been funny.

12:31.550 --> 12:35.077
- You're a Weaver. I took you
for an isosceles guy.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.089
- I have a rotator cuff issue so
I have to use the Weaver stance.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.350
- You are tight.

12:40.390 --> 12:42.312
- I got stabbed
when I was a cop.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.419
- Yeah, I got stabbed
in the third grade

12:44.460 --> 12:47.850
with a number two pencil.
Thought I was gonna get
lead poisoning.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.460
- Uh, no lead in pencils;
it's graphite.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.537
- See if that helps
with the recoil.

13:03.980 --> 13:05.538
- That was better.

13:05.580 --> 13:08.913
You come all the way down here
to teach me how to shoot?

13:16.120 --> 13:18.156
(crow cawing)

13:35.510 --> 13:39.105
- So, Lecter gave you
the all-clear.

13:39.150 --> 13:41.471
Therapy might work on you
after all.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.342
- Therapy is an acquired taste
which I have yet to acquire.

13:45.390 --> 13:49.087
But, uh, it served your purpose.
I'm back in the field.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.849
- Local police found

13:50.890 --> 13:53.495
tire tracks
on a hidden service road

13:53.530 --> 13:56.124
and some small animal traps
in the surrounding area.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.526
- He wanted to keep his crop
undisturbed.

13:58.570 --> 14:00.891
- The only thing missing is
the scarecrow.

14:04.310 --> 14:08.269
- OK, we've got nine bodies,
various stages of decay,
and as you can see,

14:08.310 --> 14:10.540
all very well fertilized.

14:10.580 --> 14:14.141
_ -_ He buri_ed them
In a high-nutrient compost.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.546
He was enthusiastically
encouraging decomposition.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.889
- They were buried alive with
the intention of keeping them

14:18.920 --> 14:21.286
that way--I mean,
for a little while.

14:21.320 --> 14:25.120
- (Jimmy): Long enough
for the fungus to eat away any
distinguishing characteristics.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.128
- Line and rebar were used

14:27.160 --> 14:30.994
to administer intravenous fluids
after they were buried.

14:31.030 --> 14:33.294
He was feeding them
something.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.436
- No restraints?

14:37.470 --> 14:40.439
- Just dirt.
- The other end
of the air-supply system

14:40.480 --> 14:42.129
comes up over there.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.341
It isn't a very considerate
clean air solution,

14:44.380 --> 14:48.043
which clearly wasn't a priority,
'cause he isn't lazy.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.208
- No, he's not.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.628
- You find any shitakes?

14:58.660 --> 15:01.197
- (Jimmy): No.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.221
- Welcome back.

15:11.470 --> 15:14.678
- Tell Sam to give me a call,
will you? Thank you.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.346
- Excuse me.
I'm one of the parents

15:22.380 --> 15:24.712
of the explorers
who found the bodies.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.310
I wanted to thank you for being
so good with all the boys.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.579
- Those boys were very brave.
- They are good boys.
- Yeah.

15:30.630 --> 15:34.350
- You're a local
police detective?
- Yes ma'am.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.960
- Would it be an imposition
to ask a few things?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.969
The boys are gonna have
questions and I just want
to be as honest with them as--

15:40.000 --> 15:42.662
- Of course.
- Can you, uh,

15:42.700 --> 15:45.498
tell me what that man is doing
over there by himself?

15:45.540 --> 15:47.599
- He's some kind
of specral consultant.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.404
Works for the FBI.
- Huh.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.121
(sound muted)

16:10.700 --> 16:14.431
(soft ambient pulse)

16:56.610 --> 16:59.078
(Sound returns.)

17:03.090 --> 17:06.139
- I do not bind his arms
or legs

17:06.190 --> 17:09.557
as I bury him
in a shallow grave.

17:09.590 --> 17:13.822
(ventilator pumping)

17:13.860 --> 17:16.192
He's alive.

17:16.230 --> 17:19.324
But he will never
be conSCIous again.

17:27.510 --> 17:29.569
He won't know that he's dying.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.343
I don't need him to.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.241
This is my design.

17:48.530 --> 17:51.090
- I think your family's leaving.
- We drove separately.

17:51.130 --> 17:54.361
(muffled gasp)
(Will gasping)

17:54.400 --> 17:56.732
- (Will): I need an EMT!

17:56.770 --> 18:01.400
(person gasping)

18:01.440 --> 18:04.500
- (Katz): EMT! We need an EMT!
- (Zeller): Don't touch him!

18:12.550 --> 18:14.654
- This may have been premature.

18:16.660 --> 18:20.653
- What did you see?
Out in the field.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.491
- Hobbs.

18:24.530 --> 18:25.895
- An association?

18:25.930 --> 18:27.534
- A hallucination.

18:27.570 --> 18:30.437
I saw him lying there
in someone else's grave.

18:30.470 --> 18:33.507
- Did you tell Jack
what you saw?

18:33.540 --> 18:35.679
- No.

18:35.710 --> 18:38.270
- It's stress.

18:38.310 --> 18:39.846
Not worth reporting.

18:39.880 --> 18:43.247
You displaced the victim
of another killer's crime

18:43.290 --> 18:46.384
with what could arguably be
considered your victim.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.684
- I don't consider Hobbs
my VIctIm.

18:48.720 --> 18:52.429
- What do you consider him?

18:52.460 --> 18:54.451
- Dead.

18:57.700 --> 19:00.794
- Is it harder
imagining the thrill
somebody else feels killing,

19:00.840 --> 19:03.434
now that you've done it
yourself?

19:17.520 --> 19:18.885
The arms.

19:18.920 --> 19:23.289
Why did he leave them exposed?
To hold their hands?

19:23.330 --> 19:25.548
To feel the life
leaving their bodies?

19:25.590 --> 19:29.629
- No, that's too esoteric for
someone who_too_k _the time
to bury his Victims

19:29.660 --> 19:32.299
in a straight line.
He's more practical.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.639
- He was cultivating them.
- He was keeping them alive.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.638
He was feeding them
intravenously.

19:36.670 --> 19:39.662
- But your farmer let his crops
die. Save for the one
that didn't.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.304
- Well, and the one that didn't
died on the way to the hospital,

19:42.340 --> 19:44.706
though they weren't crops;
they were the fertilizer. The
bodies were covered in fungus.

19:44.750 --> 19:48.572
- The structure
of a fungus mirrors
that of the human brain--

19:48.620 --> 19:50.986
an intricate_ web
of connections.

19:51.020 --> 19:55.514
- So maybe he admires
their ability to connect

19:55.560 --> 19:57.528
the way human minds can't.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.358
- Yours can.
(Will laughs.)

20:00.400 --> 20:03.392
- Yep. Um... yeah,
not physically.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.561
- Is that what your farmer is
looking for?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.761
Some sort of connection?

20:12.040 --> 20:14.235
- (Will): Goodbye.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.488
- Miss Kimball?
- Yes.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.249
- Good evening. Please come in.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.162
- I'v
8,

20:41.200 --> 20:43.907
uh, never seen
a psychiatrist before.

20:43.940 --> 20:47.569
And I am unfortunately
thorough,

20:47.610 --> 20:51.808
so you're one of three doctors
I'm interviewing.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.318
It's more or less
a bake-off.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.443
- I'm very supportive
of bake-offs.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.539
It's important you find someone
you're comfortable with.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.718
- I can imagine you
as my therapist,

21:01.760 --> 21:03.751
which is good.

21:03.790 --> 21:07.920
If_I can't visualize
opening up emotionally,
I know it would be a problem.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.928
- May I ask why now?

21:09.960 --> 21:12.428
- Do you mind ifI ask you

21:12.470 --> 21:15.598
a few questions first?
- Of course not.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.859
- I love that you've written
so much on social exclusion.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.572
Since that's why I'm here,
I was wondering--

21:21.610 --> 21:23.601
- Are you Freddie Lounds?

21:27.620 --> 21:31.317
This is unethical,
even for a tabloid journalist.

21:31.350 --> 21:33.318
- I am, uh,

21:33.360 --> 21:35.487
I am so embarrassed.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.754
- I'm afraid I must ask
for your bag.

21:39.790 --> 21:41.849
- What?

21:41.900 --> 21:43.458
- Your bag.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.992
Please hand it over.

21:47.030 --> 21:49.362
I'd rather not take it
from you.

21:52.010 --> 21:54.604
Thank you.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.702
- I was recording
our conversation.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.116
- Our conversation?
Yours and mine?

22:02.150 --> 22:04.015
- Yes.

22:04.050 --> 22:06.041
- No other conversation?

22:06.090 --> 22:07.682
- No.

22:09.690 --> 22:11.885
- You were very persistent
about your appointment time.

22:11.930 --> 22:14.626
How did you know
when Will Graham would be here?

22:14.660 --> 22:16.992
- I may have also recorded
your session with Will Graham.

22:17.030 --> 22:18.998
- You didn't answer
the question. How did you know?

22:19.030 --> 22:22.397
- I can't answer
that question.

22:24.770 --> 22:26.931
- Come. Sit by me.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.716
Delete the conversations
you recorded.

22:36.750 --> 22:39.878
Doctor-patient confidentiality
works both ways.

22:41.890 --> 22:43.881
Delete it, please.

22:51.630 --> 22:55.134
You've been terribly rude,
Miss Lounds.

22:58.170 --> 23:00.968
What's to be done
about that?

23:03.480 --> 23:06.608
***
(J.S. Bach:
Cello Suite No.4: Prelude)

23:06.650 --> 23:09.642
Loin, served with a Cumberland
sauce of red fruits.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.989
- Um, loin. What kind?

23:12.020 --> 23:15.183
- Pork.
- Wonderful.

23:15.220 --> 23:19.429
I don't get many opportunities
to, uh, eat home-cooked meals.

23:19.460 --> 23:23.669
My wife and I both work, and,
uh, as hard as I tried not to,

23:23.700 --> 23:26.464
I did wind up
marrying my mother.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.560
- Your mother didn't cook?

23:29.600 --> 23:31.704
- She did, she did.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.139
I only wish she didn't.

23:33.170 --> 23:35.206
There was this meal

23:35.240 --> 23:37.708
she used to prepare. She liked
to call it "oriental noodles".

23:37.750 --> 23:42.016
Spaghetti, soy sauce,
bouillon cubes, and spam.

23:42.050 --> 23:44.712
I was raised thin
as a youngster.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.843
- Well, next time,
bring your wife.

23:46.890 --> 23:49.814
I'd love to have you
both for dinner.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.589
- Thank you.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.120
Mmm.

23:53.160 --> 23:56.755
Lovely. So, why do you think
Will Graham

23:56.800 --> 23:58.722
came back to see you?
- I'm sure

23:58.770 --> 24:01.637
he recognizes the necessity
of his own support structure

24:01.670 --> 24:03.638
if he is to go on supporting
you in the field.

24:03.670 --> 24:05.638
- Well, I believe that a guy
like Will Graham knows

24:05.670 --> 24:07.638
exactly what's going on
inside of his head,

24:07.680 --> 24:09.898
which is why he doesn't want
anyone else up there.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.773
- Are you not accustomed
to broken ponies in your stable?

24:12.810 --> 24:15.517
- You think Will Graham's
a broken pony?

24:15.550 --> 24:18.485
- I think you think Will is
a broken pony.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.147
Have you ever lost
a pony, Jack?

24:20.190 --> 24:22.750
- If you're asking me
whether or not I've ever

24:22.790 --> 24:25.884
lost someone in the field,
the answer is yes. Why?

24:25.930 --> 24:28.728
- I want to understand why
you're so delicate with Will.

24:28.760 --> 24:32.161
Because you don't trust him,
or because you're afraid
of losing another pony?

24:32.200 --> 24:36.034
- I've already had
my psych eval.

24:36.070 --> 24:38.868
- Not by me.

24:38.910 --> 24:42.107
You've already told me
about your mother.
Why stop there?

24:45.950 --> 24:49.579
- (laughing): Oh, great.
All right.

24:53.790 --> 24:55.519
Mm.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.625
- What were they soaked in?
- A highly concentrated mixture

25:06.670 --> 25:09.036
of hardwoods, shredded
newspaper, and pig poop--

25:09.070 --> 25:11.163
perfect for growing mushrooms
and other fungi.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.166
- It was not
the mushrooms, though.

25:13.210 --> 25:15.929
They all died of kidney failure.
- Dextrose in all the catheters.

25:15.980 --> 25:18.540
He probably used some kind
of dialysis or peristaltic

25:18.580 --> 25:20.912
to pump fluids after their
circulatory systems broke down.

25:20.950 --> 25:22.918
- Force-feeding them
sugar water?

25:22.950 --> 25:25.919
- (Jimmy): You know who loves
sugar water? Mushrooms.
They crave it.

25:25.950 --> 25:29.317
- Recovering alcoholics.
They crave sugar. Uh, don't
take that personally, buddy.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.988
- Oh, I'm not recovering.
- Feed sugar to the fungus

25:32.030 --> 25:37.718
in your body, the fungus creates
alcohol, so it's like friends
helping friends, really.

25:37.770 --> 25:41.968
- It's not just alcoholics
who have compromised
endocrine systems.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.662
They all died of kidney failure?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.666
- Mm-hmm.

25:46.710 --> 25:48.701
- Death by diabetic
ketoacidosis.

25:48.740 --> 25:51.948
- Did you know
they were diabetics?
- We don't know

25:51.980 --> 25:54.619
they were diabetics.
- No, they're all diabetics.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.948
He induces a coma
and puts them in the ground.

25:56.980 --> 25:59.585
- How is he inducing
diabetic comas?

25:59.620 --> 26:01.588
- Changes their medication.
So he's a doctor or a pharmacist

26:01.620 --> 26:04.088
or_he wor_ks somewhere
in medical serwces.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.086
- He buries them, feeds them
sugar to keep them alive

26:06.130 --> 26:08.598
long enough for the circulatory
systems to soak it up.

26:08.630 --> 26:12.020
- So he can feed the mushrooms!
- We dug up his mushroom garden.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.061
- Yeah, he's gonna want
to grow a new one.

26:24.650 --> 26:27.175
- I'm picking up a prescription
for Gretchen Speck.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.178
- Gretchen Speck...
(typing)

26:29.220 --> 26:31.142
Horowitz.
- Oh, it's just Speck.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.751
We're divorced. I lost
the hyphen, kept the ring.

26:34.790 --> 26:37.008
- Insulin.
- Yes.

26:39.030 --> 26:42.898
- Oh. Oh, it's
the wrong one. Just...

26:42.930 --> 26:45.319
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, it's OK.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.190
Just gonna be one second.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.231
There. There you go.

26:55.410 --> 26:58.004
Oh can you sign here please?

27:02.680 --> 27:06.889
And that's your correct address?
- Yeah.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.218
Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:17.130 --> 27:18.893
Mrs. James.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.034
If you could sign here, please?

27:27.270 --> 27:28.771
Thank you.

27:33.250 --> 27:36.879
- She's the chain's 10th
diabetic customer to disappear

27:36.920 --> 27:38.945
after filling a prescription
for insulin,

27:38.990 --> 27:40.958
second to disappear
from this exact location.

27:40.990 --> 27:43.823
- And the other eight?
- All over the county.
One pharmacist

27:43.860 --> 27:46.249
all over the county as well.
- Floater, huh?

27:46.290 --> 27:49.259
- Floater's floating right here.
Still logged in at his
work station.

27:53.740 --> 27:57.232
Everyone please stop
what you are doing;

27:57.270 --> 28:00.808
put your hands in the air!

28:00.840 --> 28:03.070
Special Agent Jack Crawford.
Which one of you is

28:03.110 --> 28:04.475
Eldon Stammets?

28:04.510 --> 28:06.478
- Eldon was just here.

28:06.510 --> 28:09.377
Just now.
- Is his car still

28:09.420 --> 28:12.241
in the parking lot?

28:12.290 --> 28:14.281
- His car!

28:16.360 --> 28:18.180
- Give me your baton.

28:27.870 --> 28:29.838
Ugh!

28:29.870 --> 28:32.862
(ventilator pumping)

28:37.180 --> 28:39.148
She's alive!

28:39.180 --> 28:41.876
(Jack coughing)

28:41.920 --> 28:43.410
- EMTS! NOW!

28:50.460 --> 28:53.156
- All right.
We know his name,

28:53.190 --> 28:56.125
we have his address,
we have his car.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.219
- Jack. We just checked
the browser history

28:58.270 --> 29:00.420
at Stammets' work station.
- Am I gonna wanna hear this?

29:00.470 --> 29:04.429
- No. And yes,
but mostly no.

29:08.210 --> 29:11.043
- Freddie Lounds.
- (Jack): TattleCrime.com.

29:11.080 --> 29:14.447
- "The FBI isn't just hunting
psychopaths, they're
headhunting them

29:14.480 --> 29:17.210
"too, offering competitive pay
and benefits in the hopes

29:17.250 --> 29:22.210
of using one demented mind--"
- Keep going.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.024
- (Katz): It's about Will.
- (Jack): Go on.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.278
- "One demented mind
to catch--"

29:27.330 --> 29:30.094
She goes into a lot of detail.
- Son of a bitch.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.844
- You are naughty, Miss Lounds.

29:54.420 --> 29:56.513
(knocking on door)

29:56.560 --> 29:59.484
- Who is it?

29:59.530 --> 30:01.589
(knocking on door)

30:01.630 --> 30:04.861
Who is it?

30:07.500 --> 30:10.139
Ah!

30:17.880 --> 30:20.542
- (Zeller): All clear.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.884
- I appreciate the pageantry,
Agent Crawford,

30:25.920 --> 30:28.218
but you can't arrest me
for writing an article.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.353
- You entered a federal _crime
scene Without permi55ion.

30:30.390 --> 30:33.382
- Escorted by a detective.
- Under false pretence!

30:33.430 --> 30:35.398
- It is as good as permission.

30:35.430 --> 30:37.967
- You lied to a police officer.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.163
- You can't arrest me for lying.

30:45.270 --> 30:48.034
- You got all that information
from a local detective?

30:52.050 --> 30:54.143
- Lots of talk
about your man Graham.

30:54.180 --> 30:57.172
Not to mention the rivalry
of who gets the collar.

30:57.220 --> 31:00.314
A local police detective
looking for a pissing contest

31:00.350 --> 31:02.318
with the FBI might have
some insight.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.555
- And evidently did.
- Sure did.

31:04.590 --> 31:07.559
- You know, the unfortunate
timing of your article allowed

31:07.590 --> 31:09.592
a murderer to escape.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.666
You were in Minnesota.

31:15.700 --> 31:19.033
You were in the Shrike's nest.
You know how I know?

31:19.070 --> 31:21.334
'Cause you left one
of these hairs behind.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.336
You contaminated
the crime scene.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.598
Just like everywhere you go,
you contaminate crime scenes.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.471
That's obstructing justice.
I can indict you

31:28.520 --> 31:31.318
for obstructing justice.

31:31.350 --> 31:34.911
- I'd appreciate it
if you didn't.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.053
- You don't write another word
about Will Graham

31:37.090 --> 31:39.058
and I won't have to.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.409
- (Zeller): You used me.

31:53.670 --> 31:57.401
(monitor beeping)
(ventilator pumping)

32:07.290 --> 32:11.522
(footsteps)

32:58.710 --> 33:03.409
- "He and the Grandmother
discussed better times.
The old lady said that

33:03.440 --> 33:06.273
"in her opinion,
Europe was entirely

33:06.310 --> 33:08.414
to blame for the way things were
now. She said--"

33:08.450 --> 33:10.042
- What are you reading?

33:15.320 --> 33:18.027
- Flannery O'Connor.

33:18.060 --> 33:20.358
When I was Abigail's age,

33:20.390 --> 33:22.426
I was obsessed. I even tried
to raise peacocks

33:22.460 --> 33:25.258
because she raised peacocks.

33:25.300 --> 33:28.189
But... they were
really stupid birds.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.236
- You could be reading
to a killer.

33:32.270 --> 33:37.037
- Innocent until guilty
and all that.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.207
I'm about to broach the subject

33:39.250 --> 33:44.142
of that "Takes One
to Know One" article.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.681
- Oh, that.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.688
Did Jack send you?

33:48.720 --> 33:52.087
- No, I sent me.

33:54.160 --> 33:58.699
- I don't think we've ever been
alone in a room together,
have we?

33:58.730 --> 34:01.699
- I haven't noticed.
Have we?

34:01.740 --> 34:05.608
Not that we're
necessarily alone now.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.279
- Yeah, right. Back to...

34:08.310 --> 34:12.349
"Jack Crawford's crime gimp".
- It certainly creates an image.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.575
I don't need to talk about it

34:14.620 --> 34:17.214
if you don't.
- No, no, we can talk about

34:17.250 --> 34:20.640
or not talk about
whatever you want.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.228
Actually, I was...

34:26.260 --> 34:29.229
I was just enjoying
listening to you read.

34:32.270 --> 34:35.535
- Abigail Hobbs is a success
for you.

34:40.670 --> 34:43.878
- She doesn't look
like a success.

34:43.910 --> 34:47.243
- Don't feel sorry
for yourself

34:47.280 --> 34:50.511
because you saved
this girl's life.
- I don't.

34:50.550 --> 34:54.384
I don't feel sorry for myself
at all.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.514
Ifeel, um...

34:57.560 --> 34:59.528
I-I...

34:59.560 --> 35:01.289
Ifeel, um...

35:04.830 --> 35:06.695
...good.

35:46.710 --> 35:49.679
- Don't know where you got
half that information.
It wasn't from me.

35:49.710 --> 35:52.178
- I may have made
some inferences.

35:52.210 --> 35:54.747
- They think I told you
all of it.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.748
- They saw you talking to me.

35:56.780 --> 36:00.216
- They think it's my fault
Stammets escaped.

36:00.250 --> 36:02.616
- I'm sorry I got you fired.
- I wasn't fired.

36:02.660 --> 36:05.458
I was suspended.
- They're gonna fire you.

36:05.490 --> 36:07.583
Jack Crawford will make sure
of that.

36:07.630 --> 36:09.427
- You...

36:09.460 --> 36:12.725
you stir the hornet's nest,
and I'm the one who gets stung?

36:12.770 --> 36:16.297
- I can help you get work
outside the force,
if you want me to.

36:16.340 --> 36:19.264
I know people
in private security.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.703
- Not the first cop
you got fired.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.970
- Guarantee you it pays better.
Right now,

36:26.010 --> 36:28.513
future you is thanking me.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.485
- I read your article.

36:33.520 --> 36:36.512
Tell me about Will Graham.

36:47.530 --> 36:49.498
- (Lounds): Hey, Jack.

36:49.540 --> 36:53.408
- Miss Lounds?

36:53.440 --> 36:57.979
Go ahead and stand down,
officer. Miss Lounds,
are you all right?

36:58.010 --> 36:59.272
- Where's Will Graham?

36:59.310 --> 37:01.517
- We have an eyewitness
to the murder. We don't need
Will Graham.

37:01.550 --> 37:04.246
- No, that's not why I'm asking.

37:04.350 --> 37:05.783
- Someone find me Will Graham!

37:07.420 --> 37:09.957
This is about Will?
- He was talking about people

37:09.990 --> 37:12.788
having the same properties
of a fungus.
- Stammets?

37:12.830 --> 37:16.391
- Thoughts leaping
from brain to brain.
They mutate, they evolve.

37:16.430 --> 37:21.265
- Well, what does
he want with Will Graham?
- Someone who understands him.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.269
Graham was right. Stammets is
looking for connections.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.834
- What did you tell him?

37:27.840 --> 37:29.535
I need to know

37:29.580 --> 37:32.902
what you told Eldon Stammets
about Will Graham.

37:32.950 --> 37:34.918
- I told him
about the Hobbs girl.

37:34.950 --> 37:37.271
- What did you tell him?

37:37.320 --> 37:39.686
- Everything.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.848
He wants to help Will Graham
connect with Abigail Hobbs.

37:42.890 --> 37:45.381
He's gonna bury her.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.954
(ding!)

37:46.990 --> 37:48.992
- Sorry.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.448
(ding!)

38:11.490 --> 38:14.914
(phone ringing)

38:14.960 --> 38:16.916
- Hello?
- [It's Jack.]

38:16.960 --> 38:18.928
[Are you at the hospital?]
- Yes, I am.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.952
- [Stammets knows
about Abigail Hobbs.]

38:41.110 --> 38:44.546
- Where is she? Abigail Hobbs,
the girl in 408. Where is she?

38:44.590 --> 38:46.649
- They took her for tests.
- Who took her?

38:46.690 --> 38:49.352
Who took her?!

39:02.970 --> 39:05.029
Hey!

39:07.540 --> 39:09.929
(grunting in pain)

39:22.790 --> 39:25.384
What were you gonna do to her?

39:25.430 --> 39:27.921
- We all evolved
from mycelium.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.928
I'm simply reintroducing her
to the concept.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.928
- By burying her alive?

39:31.970 --> 39:34.438
- The journalist said
you understood me.

39:34.470 --> 39:36.097
- I don't.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.859
- Well, you would have.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.470
You would have.

39:41.510 --> 39:43.603
If you walk through a field
of mycelium,

39:43.640 --> 39:45.801
they know you are there.
They know you are there.

39:45.850 --> 39:50.469
The spores reach for you
as you walk by.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.785
I know who you're reaching for.
I know.

39:55.820 --> 39:58.459
Abigail Hobbs.

39:58.490 --> 40:00.754
And you should have let me
plant her.

40:00.790 --> 40:03.497
You would have found her
in a field,

40:03.530 --> 40:06.169
where she was finally able
to reach back!

40:10.470 --> 40:13.109
- (Lecter): When you shot
Eldon Stammets,

40:13.140 --> 40:15.108
who was it that you saw?

40:15.140 --> 40:19.099
- I didn't see Hobbs.

40:19.150 --> 40:22.449
- Then it's not Hobbs' ghost
that's haunting you, is it?

40:22.480 --> 40:25.119
It's the inevitability

40:25.150 --> 40:29.109
of there being a man so bad
that killing him felt good.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.458
- Killing Hobbs felt just.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.728
- Which is why
you're here--

40:35.760 --> 40:37.990
to prove that sprig of zest
you feel is

40:38.030 --> 40:40.464
from saving Abigail,
not from killing her dad.

40:40.500 --> 40:44.869
- I didn't feel a sprig of zest
when I shot Eldon Stammets.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.162
- You didn't kill
Eldon Stammets.

40:51.780 --> 40:54.874
- I thought about it.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.878
I'm still not entirely sure
that wasn't my intention

40:57.920 --> 41:00.013
pulling the trigger.

41:00.050 --> 41:02.154
- If your intention was
to kill him,

41:02.190 --> 41:05.626
it's because you understand
why he did the things he did.

41:05.660 --> 41:09.721
_ It's beautiful
in its own way--

41:09.760 --> 41:13.491
giving voice
to the unmentionable.

41:13.530 --> 41:17.136
- I should've stuck to fixing
boat motors in Louisiana.

41:17.170 --> 41:22.130
- A boat engine is a machine,
a predictable problem,
easy to solve.

41:22.180 --> 41:25.274
You fail, there's a paddle.
Where was your paddle
with Hobbs?

41:25.310 --> 41:29.644
- You're supposed
to be my paddle.
-Iam.

41:29.680 --> 41:34.185
It wasn't the act of killing
Hobbs that got you down, was it?

41:36.190 --> 41:40.684
Did you really feel so bad
because killing him felt
so good?

41:42.700 --> 41:44.793
- I liked killing Hobbs.

41:49.070 --> 41:51.903
- Killing must feel good
to God too--

41:51.940 --> 41:54.306
he does it all the time.

41:54.340 --> 41:56.979
And are we not created
in his image?

41:57.010 --> 42:00.639
- That depends
who you ask.

42:00.680 --> 42:03.046
- God's terrific.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.913
He dropped a church roof
on 34 of his worshippers

42:05.950 --> 42:09.078
last Wednesday night in Texas,
while they sang a hymn.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.953
- And did God feel good
about that?

42:13.690 --> 42:15.248
- He felt powerful.

42:22.870 --> 42:25.862
