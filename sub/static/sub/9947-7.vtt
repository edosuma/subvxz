00:08.360 --> 00:11.479
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.480 --> 00:13.239
sending prices sky-high,

00:13.240 --> 00:17.079
literally taking the grass
from its own roots.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.959
And now you've
got your ConDemNation,

00:19.960 --> 00:23.919
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.199
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:27.200 --> 00:29.719
Is revolution a word...

00:29.720 --> 00:31.359

Anybody watching needs to know, we cope
better than average with irony in Chatsworth.

Well, for fucks' sake,
we live in Manchester,

it'd be easy to rob a brothel.

Oh, Shane.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.479
I bet no-one's ever
robbed a brothel.

01:34.480 --> 01:38.479
And we won't be the first.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.719

no more robbing.

I'm just thinking aloud.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.079
Well, think about something else.

15:58.053 --> 15:59.932
I'll draw up the rota.
Who gets it and when.

15:59.933 --> 16:02.372
It was my card, though.
It was my card!

16:02.373 --> 16:04.652
Always fucking whinging.

16:04.653 --> 16:08.652
Buy us out, or shut the fuck up.

16:09.653 --> 16:11.692
Now, remember, I always get paid.

16:11.693 --> 16:15.692
Even if I have to wait till
you've done a three stretch.

16:22.293 --> 16:26.132
I'll get Shane to put
a bigger engine in this.

16:26.133 --> 16:28.412
You can't take Cilla on it
if it goes too fast.

16:28.413 --> 16:32.412
And she'll have to get
a helmet and earmuffs.

16:33.813 --> 16:37.212
(WOMAN MOANS)

16:37.213 --> 16:38.412
That's not Kelly.

16:38.413 --> 16:40.292
They're torturing someone.

16:40.293 --> 16:42.412
In the house?!

16:42.413 --> 16:46.012
I knew it was a bad move,
them going on their own.

16:46.013 --> 16:48.092
Much as it pains me
to slag one of me own...

16:48.093 --> 16:50.092
Clueless without our Jamie.

16:50.093 --> 16:53.252
Our Jamie would never bring
his work home like that.

16:53.253 --> 16:55.452
Tell him I said
he can't keep her here.

16:55.453 --> 16:59.452
And he'd better clean any mess.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.372
(TV) 'Police are still waiting
for the kidnappers...'

17:10.373 --> 17:11.892
Mam says you've got to
take her somewhere else.

17:11.893 --> 17:13.172
Grass.

17:13.173 --> 17:14.892
How's that grassing
when she can hear her?

17:14.893 --> 17:17.811
'..the search is focused on the
Chatsworth estate of Manchester,

17:17.813 --> 17:20.852
'where a stolen car believed
to be used in the abduction

17:20.853 --> 17:22.932
'has been discovered.

17:22.933 --> 17:25.811
'The MP for Chatsworth and
Trafford West made the headlines...'

17:25.813 --> 17:28.972
A politician's wife?

17:28.973 --> 17:30.372
Er, hello?

17:30.373 --> 17:34.372
Maguire - crime family.

17:35.533 --> 17:39.532
Don't you think it's a bit
brain-dead bringing her back here?

17:44.493 --> 17:46.532
They think this is real.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.572
Who does?

17:47.573 --> 17:50.612
Everyone. The news,
the police are all over Chatsworth.

17:50.613 --> 17:51.732
Why?

17:51.733 --> 17:54.612
Because somebody
didn't turn her cameras off.

17:54.613 --> 17:56.292
Oops.

17:56.293 --> 17:59.852
It doesn't matter what they think,
she paid for this. So we're OK.

17:59.853 --> 18:03.652
No, the police kick fuck out of Maguires
first and ask questions later.

18:03.653 --> 18:04.692
We need to sort it, now.

18:04.693 --> 18:06.132
Well, I can't go.

18:06.133 --> 18:07.492
Why?

18:07.493 --> 18:10.532
I don't think exposing
my fantasy will impress the voters.

18:10.533 --> 18:11.452
Voters?

18:11.453 --> 18:12.532
Voters?
Her husband's an MP.

18:12.533 --> 18:15.452
Oh!

18:15.453 --> 18:17.179
Can't we talk about this?
No.

18:17.299 --> 18:18.427
I'll tell them it is real.

18:18.672 --> 18:22.513
I left the cameras running on purpose,
he needs the publicity, sympathy, my husband.

18:22.633 --> 18:23.503
Is he in on it?

18:23.623 --> 18:25.218
No, never.
He's too straight.

18:26.450 --> 18:30.692
Now I really don't trust this.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.852
Kelly...

18:33.853 --> 18:36.692
I can't go!

18:36.693 --> 18:40.692
Don't be stupid!

18:41.133 --> 18:45.132
Shane.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.852
Go on, then.

18:48.853 --> 18:50.212
Go on.

18:50.213 --> 18:54.212
See how much sympathy that gets.

18:59.773 --> 19:01.732
I'll make it look real.

19:01.733 --> 19:02.772
Don't be mental!

19:02.773 --> 19:05.932
You'll get at least
seven years for kidnap.

19:05.933 --> 19:09.932
Shane...

19:14.173 --> 19:18.172
She's full of shit.

19:25.533 --> 19:29.532
(SCREAMS)

19:40.413 --> 19:44.212
Ches? Hello?

19:44.213 --> 19:48.212
Oi!

19:55.813 --> 19:59.492
Ches! You promised
to go to the wholesaler's.

19:59.493 --> 20:01.492
Yeah.

20:01.493 --> 20:02.572
So what's up?

20:02.573 --> 20:03.892
It's all right.

20:03.893 --> 20:06.052
You overslept,
you stink of booze

20:06.053 --> 20:07.892
and you left the door open
all night.

20:07.893 --> 20:09.932
Local store for local people.

20:09.933 --> 20:11.652
No-one'll rob us.

20:11.653 --> 20:14.852
Aidan and Letitia forgot to leave
IOUs for the booze they took, then?

20:14.853 --> 20:18.852
They'll pay when I threaten them.

20:19.693 --> 20:21.652
The shelves are bare.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.772
I am going to the wholesaler's.

20:24.773 --> 20:25.812
Are you a doctor?

20:25.813 --> 20:26.932
Not yet.

20:26.933 --> 20:28.052
Can you stitch stuff?

20:28.053 --> 20:29.772
Stitched me up plenty of times.

20:29.773 --> 20:31.932
Within reason.

20:31.933 --> 20:35.132
I need a favour. Now.

20:35.133 --> 20:36.892
Please.

20:36.893 --> 20:38.972
This is bad.

20:38.973 --> 20:40.772
Jamie'd never fuck up like this.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.812
What if he works for a newspaper?

20:42.813 --> 20:45.972
Think he'll confess to anything?
Look at the fucking state of him.

20:45.973 --> 20:47.572
This won't even need a stitch.

20:47.573 --> 20:51.572
Whoa, here you are. I've given
her loads of painkillers.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.972
(SCREAMS)

20:55.973 --> 20:59.812
Hold that, hold it. Shit!
Put your hand on there.

20:59.813 --> 21:03.692
Fucking hell.

21:03.693 --> 21:05.892
Not poppers!

21:05.893 --> 21:09.892
Get some of this up your beak.

21:10.653 --> 21:12.732
You said stitch.

21:12.733 --> 21:14.652
We kept it in ice.

21:14.653 --> 21:18.172
Macca had his ear in the
freezer for a month, so...

21:18.173 --> 21:20.692
You need a micro surgeon.
Call an ambulance.

21:20.693 --> 21:21.812
We can't.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.092
That's why we need you.

21:23.093 --> 21:24.852
It was just an accident.

21:24.853 --> 21:27.572
You can see we're all still friends.

21:27.573 --> 21:31.572
Yeah, yeah...

21:33.853 --> 21:35.532
Please.

21:35.533 --> 21:38.492
Ice might keep the finger OK,
but the chance of wound infection

21:38.493 --> 21:40.492
increases by the second.

21:40.493 --> 21:43.692
Then gangrene, arm amputation...

21:43.693 --> 21:45.732
How long before that happens?

21:45.733 --> 21:49.412
If infected, the spread speeds
up the longer you leave it.

21:49.413 --> 21:51.612
You need to get to a hospital.

21:51.613 --> 21:54.132
Yeah, it's...

21:54.133 --> 21:56.292
The blood's stemmed,
but the longer you...

21:56.293 --> 22:00.292
OK, but what's the longest
we can wait?

22:03.733 --> 22:07.732
If you don't get to
a hospital in 24 hours...

22:08.493 --> 22:12.492
Look, thanks for coming.

22:17.853 --> 22:21.852
Look, you cannot keep her here.

22:22.733 --> 22:24.852
Why don't you
just ask Jamie what he'd do?

22:24.853 --> 22:26.372
Because we don't need anyone's help.

22:26.373 --> 22:28.652
Course not(!)

22:28.653 --> 22:30.692
KNOCK ON DOOR

22:30.693 --> 22:34.692
Dibble. Leg it!

22:40.973 --> 22:44.972
You go out the back door,
I'll stall the filth.

22:51.293 --> 22:55.292
Have you nothing better to do?

23:06.853 --> 23:10.852
SIREN WAILS

23:18.333 --> 23:20.252
Bye, thanks for your time.

Come on!

24:03.613 --> 24:06.012
Deena needs a top-up.

24:06.013 --> 24:06.572
You're taking the piss.

24:06.573 --> 24:09.692
On my life, I'll go tomorrow.

24:09.693 --> 24:12.972
You should take a leaf out of
her book and join the party,

24:12.973 --> 24:16.972
might help you chill out.

24:17.173 --> 24:21.172
Hey!

24:23.413 --> 24:27.412
You little shit!

24:50.893 --> 24:52.572
'Ambulance, police or fire?'

24:52.573 --> 24:54.172
Anti-terrorist unit.

24:54.173 --> 24:55.412
'Anti-terrorism.'

24:55.413 --> 24:59.412
There's something not right
in a shop in Chatsworth...

24:59.790 --> 25:03.189
'And now our top story.
The kidnappers of Sandra Brown

25:03.190 --> 25:06.349

I hope they cut her head off.

Her husband wants to close
every brothel in the country.

I'll be fucked if I'm
going back on the streets.

25:34.190 --> 25:36.389
Just take me in and I'll confess.

25:36.390 --> 25:38.589
I'll tell them what happened,
that it was all down to me.

25:38.590 --> 25:40.429
I'm sorry I put you through this.

25:40.430 --> 25:41.429
So you should be.

25:41.430 --> 25:45.429
We shouldn't leave this too long.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.549
Do you trust her to tell the truth?

25:58.550 --> 25:59.709
Well, don't you?

25:59.710 --> 26:00.869
No.

26:00.870 --> 26:03.429
We can prove it.
She paid us a deposit.

26:03.430 --> 26:07.429
In cash! No paper trail, no proof.

26:08.070 --> 26:09.345
I've got the booking in the diary.

26:09.465 --> 26:11.693
Are they going to believe she chopped
her own finger off to frame us?

26:11.813 --> 26:13.298
Look at the state of her, Kel.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.943
They'll say she's in shock,
examine her.

26:16.063 --> 26:18.196
Our DNA is all over the place.

26:23.590 --> 26:25.549
Maybe we should ask Jamie.

26:25.550 --> 26:27.349
Tell me you're joking?

26:27.350 --> 26:29.269
All right, what do you suggest?

26:29.270 --> 26:33.109
Our first problem on our first big
earner and you want to go running

26:33.110 --> 26:35.589
back for help? Fucking hell, Shane.

26:35.590 --> 26:39.589
Maybe we're not as good on
our own as we thought we'd be.

26:45.910 --> 26:49.909
Little bird told me you
might be in a spot of bother.

26:52.510 --> 26:56.509
Not everyone's cut out
to go it alone, son.

26:58.910 --> 27:02.909
I might need a little bit of help.

27:04.150 --> 27:07.349
It's blood that binds us, mate.
Preferably somebody else's.

27:07.350 --> 27:11.349
Lap it up, son. Moments like this you
treasure when you depart for that big

27:12.230 --> 27:16.189
caravan site in the sky.

27:16.190 --> 27:20.189
Just say what you need me to
do and you're back in the fold.

27:25.590 --> 27:29.589
Was it a joinery or a plastering
course you did in Strangeways?

27:30.510 --> 27:33.789
Bedroom ceiling's fucked.

27:33.790 --> 27:37.789
Do it quick,
I'll give you a bonus.

27:42.430 --> 27:44.749
(Fuckin' prick.)

27:44.750 --> 27:47.629
Mimi! It's my turn!

27:47.630 --> 27:50.229
Whatever.
You've got your own wheels.

27:50.230 --> 27:52.309
Check the fucking rota!

27:52.310 --> 27:54.949
Aah!

27:54.950 --> 27:57.509
Oopsy-daisy!

27:57.510 --> 28:01.509
Fucking typical. Yeah, don't help.
Blame us cos you're too

28:01.510 --> 28:04.309
stupid to find the MP's wife!

28:04.310 --> 28:06.789
Fucking crank!

28:06.790 --> 28:10.789
There's more to me than that.

28:12.910 --> 28:14.989
Let me take you out and prove it.

28:14.990 --> 28:17.669
Yeah, yeah, less of that!

28:17.670 --> 28:21.669
Carl, Farah wants you to show
her how to hold a pool cue.

28:21.870 --> 28:25.469
Help her pot a ball
and I might get a nosh.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.469
Rapid!

28:27.470 --> 28:29.429
Mating calls!

28:31.430 --> 28:34.589
Ches, get
her to do a line off me dick! >

28:34.590 --> 28:38.269
Move!

28:38.270 --> 28:42.269
Move!

29:02.430 --> 29:06.429
Move!

29:52.990 --> 29:54.589
Armed police,

29:54.590 --> 29:57.629
armed police!
Armed police, nobody move!

29:57.630 --> 29:59.589
Get down, get down!

29:59.590 --> 30:01.469
Get down on the floor now!

30:01.470 --> 30:03.509
Put your hands on your head!

30:03.510 --> 30:04.549
All right, all right!
Right, right!

30:04.550 --> 30:06.109
Don't move! Stay there!

30:06.110 --> 30:10.109
Put your hands on your head.

30:42.390 --> 30:46.389
About time! Oh, re-sprays
don't come cheap. That'll cost.

30:47.910 --> 30:50.069
Never mind that, look
what the bizzies did!

30:50.070 --> 30:52.509
There's more police crawling

30:52.510 --> 30:54.909
round Chatsworth
than we had in the Tockie riots.

30:54.910 --> 30:58.149
They can't find the MP's wife so
they're taking it out on Chesney.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.429
Do you reckon?

30:59.430 --> 31:01.429
Just glad I'm not Irish.

31:01.430 --> 31:03.589
Here, 'ave it.

31:03.590 --> 31:05.909
You want to get some cream on that.

31:05.910 --> 31:09.909
Ach... See ya.
See ya.

32:29.950 --> 32:31.669
Aagh!

32:31.670 --> 32:34.749
What did you think
would actually happen?

32:34.750 --> 32:36.549
Nothing. I'd just go home.

32:36.550 --> 32:38.989
It seemed a good idea.
Two birds with one stone.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.629
Does
hubby know about your rape fantasy?

32:41.630 --> 32:44.269
It's more than ten years since he
went down on me.

32:44.270 --> 32:46.429
Asking him to wear
a balaclava, a 12-inch strap-on

32:46.430 --> 32:48.869
and pull my hair would
only aggravate his IBS.

32:48.870 --> 32:52.469
I don't think we've ever
talked the way you two do.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.629
It took years to get here.

32:54.630 --> 32:58.629
But you have to stand by them,
though, even though I can't help

32:58.830 --> 33:00.869
the disappointment.

33:00.870 --> 33:03.029
The way things turned
out so different.

33:03.030 --> 33:07.029
We shouldn't even be in this mess.

33:09.710 --> 33:12.629
OK. Do you want to get out of this
without anyone knowing

33:12.630 --> 33:14.229
what a twisted deviant you are?

33:14.230 --> 33:15.669
Of course.

33:15.670 --> 33:17.069
We'll need compensating.

33:17.070 --> 33:19.429
I understand.

33:19.430 --> 33:20.709
Phone your husband.

33:20.710 --> 33:21.749
And say?

33:21.750 --> 33:23.109
50 grand.
What are you doing?

33:23.110 --> 33:26.029
Wait and see.

33:26.030 --> 33:27.949
It's been on the news,
they've got her finger.

33:27.950 --> 33:30.349
Knock, Lilian!

33:30.350 --> 33:34.349
I hope they post her tits next.

33:34.710 --> 33:38.709
They'll freeze it. Look, a finger's
no good on its own.

33:43.990 --> 33:45.909
Jihad Corps?

33:45.910 --> 33:48.229
That's your inspiration, yeah?

33:48.230 --> 33:49.469
It's just a video game.

33:49.470 --> 33:52.549
Like your driving school
just teaches clutch control?

33:52.550 --> 33:56.229
What does that mean?

33:56.230 --> 34:00.229
Is that how you recruit? Preaching
hate during driving lessons, eh?

34:02.870 --> 34:06.669
I swear...
I don't know what's going on.

34:06.670 --> 34:10.668
Why did your white
mother defect to Pakistan?

34:19.389 --> 34:23.389
It's my turn!

34:25.190 --> 34:28.228
All right, keep your knickers on.

34:28.230 --> 34:32.228
I've got to drop this lot off first.
Hang on.

34:41.389 --> 34:43.708
It's like a plague of locusts.

34:43.710 --> 34:47.708
Some people have no shame.

34:47.949 --> 34:49.869
Supermarket Sweep in the dark!

34:49.870 --> 34:53.869
Look what I got!
It'll do me a week.

34:54.949 --> 34:57.389
Why aren't you kicking them out?

34:57.390 --> 35:01.069
Because they'll only spend the
money they're saving somewhere else.

35:01.070 --> 35:03.149
It's an unfortunate
by-product of the age.

35:03.150 --> 35:05.069
Social disintegration.

35:05.070 --> 35:08.109
We used to leave our
doors off the latch.

35:08.110 --> 35:12.109
You know, everybody in and out, cup
of tea, check in on the old dears.

35:12.950 --> 35:16.669
Even during the Toxteth
riots in '81 we had principles.

35:16.670 --> 35:18.789
We didn't take from our own.

35:18.790 --> 35:19.709
You told me you got a telly.

35:19.710 --> 35:22.069
Yeah, but that was a big shop.

35:22.070 --> 35:26.069
Now it's just me, me, me...

35:59.150 --> 36:00.869
We should sue them over that poster.

36:00.870 --> 36:04.869
Oh, my god, Ches.

36:07.470 --> 36:11.469
Shit... Are you OK?

36:12.510 --> 36:14.469
Is that why they raided then?

36:14.470 --> 36:16.149
Nah.

36:16.150 --> 36:18.069
The girls think it's Yasmin's dad.

36:18.070 --> 36:22.069
Maybe you had a point.

36:25.670 --> 36:29.389
Shit.
So much for the wholesaler's.

36:29.390 --> 36:30.869
Why?

36:30.870 --> 36:33.629
Where am I going to get the
dough to restock everything?

36:33.630 --> 36:35.949
You just said it. Sue 'em.

36:35.950 --> 36:38.389
You reckon Asian brothers have
got a high success rate taking

36:38.390 --> 36:40.189
on the dibble in the British courts?

36:40.190 --> 36:43.709
I'm serious.
I had a conversation with a Law Phd.

36:43.710 --> 36:46.309
And I had a conversation
with a law C.U.N.T.

36:46.310 --> 36:47.949
I've got no chance.

36:47.950 --> 36:51.069
They left it unsecured. If they
remove the proprietor by force,

36:51.070 --> 36:54.429
it becomes their responsibility.

36:54.430 --> 36:58.429
Precedent, Customs and Immigration
versus Talybont Taxis, Cardiff 2007.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.509
Go on...

37:01.510 --> 37:03.589
If they don't
compensate within a week,

37:03.590 --> 37:05.789
then you charge them a 50% fine.

37:05.790 --> 37:08.389
I'll get Hassan to backdate
whatever receipts we want.

37:08.390 --> 37:12.389
We can say it was over-stocked.

37:13.470 --> 37:16.589
I promise I won't mess up again.

37:17.830 --> 37:18.949
What's up?

37:18.950 --> 37:22.949
1,500 quid that I owe
Jamie's what's up.

37:23.350 --> 37:27.269
Your jacket, yeah?
Yeah.

37:27.270 --> 37:28.469
How come you've got it?

37:28.470 --> 37:30.229
You left it here.

37:30.230 --> 37:32.109
So the police didn't find anything?

37:32.110 --> 37:35.349
Where's the sniff?

37:35.350 --> 37:36.949
I flushed it away.

37:36.950 --> 37:37.909
Yeah, course you did(!)

37:37.910 --> 37:41.229
I thought it was the
right thing to do.

37:41.230 --> 37:42.709
Are you stupid?!

37:42.710 --> 37:43.909
I thought they'd know
it was your jacket.

37:43.910 --> 37:45.589
You fucking stupid bitch!

37:45.590 --> 37:48.909
Hey!
Fuck off!

37:48.910 --> 37:52.309
No more parties.

37:52.310 --> 37:55.309
Listen, darling, the party's over.

37:55.310 --> 37:59.309
New management and door policy.

38:00.670 --> 38:03.149
Argh! What the f...

38:03.150 --> 38:04.149
Auntie Uzma.

38:04.150 --> 38:06.069
You told Grandad?!

38:06.070 --> 38:08.149
He saw it on the news.
What could I do?

38:08.150 --> 38:12.149
She's not staying here.

38:31.470 --> 38:33.469
Tomorrow, yeah?

38:35.741 --> 38:38.940
Libby, you start at March Way.
Kelly, when you see her,

38:38.941 --> 38:40.660
cross over to Mapley...

38:40.661 --> 38:44.660
Avril goes third from the alley,
from Byley to Cranston Lane.

38:45.341 --> 38:47.540
Aiden, you hold back on March Road,

38:47.541 --> 38:49.860
till I give you the signal.

38:49.861 --> 38:53.860

All officers leave your positions

40:06.381 --> 40:10.380

41:00.221 --> 41:04.220
The quality of DNA testing
these days, easy.

41:05.341 --> 41:09.060
You'll make it back in a week.

41:09.061 --> 41:10.980
Heard you managed to got your little
problem sorted?

41:10.981 --> 41:12.540
Never in doubt, Jamie.

41:12.541 --> 41:13.900
Done it my way,
we'd all be having a right drink.

41:13.901 --> 41:17.900
Is that the best champagne
you've got over there?

41:18.901 --> 41:19.580
I'll have one.

41:19.581 --> 41:21.740
Make that two.

41:21.741 --> 41:25.100
Three.

41:25.101 --> 41:26.380
And me.

41:26.381 --> 41:30.380
You know, we might as well
take the lot.

41:30.581 --> 41:34.580
WHOOPING

41:49.581 --> 41:50.860
Cheers, everyone.

41:50.861 --> 41:54.860
Cheers.

42:08.021 --> 42:12.020
Don't worry about it.

42:14.181 --> 42:17.740
Disgraceful.

42:17.741 --> 42:21.740
Probably be tempted myself.

42:30.141 --> 42:33.420
Even James Caan has to
listen to others.

42:33.421 --> 42:35.300
Especially James Caan.

42:35.301 --> 42:37.900
You have to accept you need help
now and again.

42:37.901 --> 42:41.900
Cos that's how you really move on.

42:43.661 --> 42:47.660
That's how you learn
the best lessons.

42:52.341 --> 42:56.340
Now, who'll have a drink?

42:59.861 --> 43:00.340
Frank?

43:00.341 --> 43:01.100
Yes?

43:01.101 --> 43:02.740
You'll have a drink.

43:02.741 --> 43:03.900
Oh.

43:03.901 --> 43:07.900
Go on.

43:09.581 --> 43:13.580
I'm just trying to smooth it over.
You know.

43:23.501 --> 43:25.780
I'm sorry.

43:25.781 --> 43:27.420
Me too.

43:27.421 --> 43:28.940
Nah, you did nothing wrong.

43:28.941 --> 43:32.940
I owe you.

43:42.541 --> 43:44.820
Listen, er, thanks a lot for
earlier, yeah?

43:44.821 --> 43:48.380
For your help with the finger.
Good job.

43:48.381 --> 43:52.380
Thanks.

44:13.021 --> 44:16.140
Hee, hee, hee, hee, paaaarty!!!

44:16.141 --> 44:18.140
Frank! It's my turn.

44:18.141 --> 44:21.660
Fuck off, Supergran! I'm entering
the raspberry Olympics.

44:21.661 --> 44:22.620
Frank! Get off the road.

44:22.621 --> 44:25.060
Evil Knievel's got nothing on me.

44:25.061 --> 44:26.700
CRASH

44:26.701 --> 44:28.820
Fuckin' hell.

44:28.821 --> 44:30.180
Jesus.

44:30.181 --> 44:34.180
What a place to park.

44:38.021 --> 44:40.820
Where do you think
you're gonna find yourself a man?

44:40.821 --> 44:43.380
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

44:43.381 --> 44:43.900
Married?

44:43.901 --> 44:47.140
Who would've thought your old mum
would beat you down the aisle?

44:47.141 --> 44:49.620
While they're waiting for the
site to download,

44:49.621 --> 44:51.380
we'll be ripping the card details.

44:51.381 --> 44:53.180
How d'you get it to
smell like actual piss?

44:53.181 --> 44:54.340
It is actual piss.

44:54.341 --> 44:55.660
We need to consummate!

44:55.661 --> 44:59.420
I'm moving in to Trevor's.

44:59.421 --> 45:01.340
Onto our target market...

45:01.341 --> 45:05.340
kiddie fiddlers.

45:42.701 --> 45:46.700
He treated me like a dog. He beat me
and abused me.

45:46.701 --> 45:50.180
My husband demands a total review of
the laws in this country

45:50.181 --> 45:53.140
and wants every vestige of
prostitution banned forever.

45:53.141 --> 45:54.380
