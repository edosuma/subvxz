17:07.720 --> 17:08.993
Everybody hugging up
all over them

17:09.079 --> 17:10.354
like they're the second coming.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.318
I lost my kids in that blast.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.598
We all lost people.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.273
That's why, for starters,

17:27.359 --> 17:29.874
I'm going to assassinate
that Allenford bitch.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.633
Are you interested?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.120
I heard what happened, Aaron.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.318
I'm just glad you're all right.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.877
Uh, Dr. Porter
told me everything.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.040
Isn't there doctor-patient-
can he do that?

17:51.120 --> 17:52.519
Do you even have a wound?

17:52.600 --> 17:54.318
No, Pastor.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.153
It completely vanished,
like it never happened.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.158
PASTOR Well, then, that's a miracle,
no two ways.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.316
God has touched you, son.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.715
Yay!

18:09.680 --> 18:12.069
Monroe: So where are they?

18:15.320 --> 18:16.674
Miles and your mom,
what happened?

18:16.720 --> 18:19.872
You have some kind
of a falling out?

18:23.240 --> 18:24.514
I get it.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.230
I'm not really the one you want
to open up to, right?

18:31.240 --> 18:32.878
Just answer me one question.

18:32.960 --> 18:36.635
You were there the night...

18:36.680 --> 18:40.435
that the bombs dropped,
in The Tower, right?

18:42.360 --> 18:44.397
Randall pushed the button,
didn't he?

18:50.640 --> 18:51.675
I knew it.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.077
I walked him
through the front door.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.674
I might as well have
pushed the button myself.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.797
Right.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.996
I'm sure you're just
torn up with guilt.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.833
You don't know me, Charlotte.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.390
A lot of people depended on me
to protect them.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.551
What did they get for it?
Cooked in their own skin.

19:16.080 --> 19:20.756
Well, did it ever occur to you,
you sucked at your job?

19:25.600 --> 19:26.749
You know,
maybe Miles has a right

19:26.800 --> 19:28.916
to talk to me like that, maybe.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.598
YOU?

19:30.680 --> 19:32.990
You don't.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.434
So watch your mouth.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.438
You don't get to tell
anybody anything.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.915
You're nothing.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.792
Just a drunk fighting
for a coin in a whorehouse.

19:47.760 --> 19:51.116
And if you won't put yourself
out of your misery,

19:51.200 --> 19:53.396
I'd be happy to do it for you.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.239
(LAUGHS)

20:01.920 --> 20:03.433
Wow.
Wow, kid.

20:03.520 --> 20:07.718
You know, you might be trying
to run away from your mom,

20:09.440 --> 20:11.795
but you are a hell
of a lot like her.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.351
You got to help me, Ken.
You're my last shot.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.317
Rachel, I'm just a butcher.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.476
I've seen you with a knife.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.473
I am begging Yo“-

20:27.560 --> 20:29.312
We're friends, right?

20:29.360 --> 20:32.557
I mean, you spent more time
passed out in my tub

20:32.640 --> 20:34.916
than you ever did
in your own bed.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.276
You're the one that fed me
all the Shiner Bock.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.391
Bill Moberg said that he saw
the clan's camp,

20:39.480 --> 20:41.391
on Route 4,
the old steel mill?

20:41.480 --> 20:42.390
Rachel.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.676
We used to drink in the
maintenance tunnels underneath.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.070
We could sneak in, grab Stu.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.309
I'm begging you.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.192
This guy, Stu,

20:51.280 --> 20:52.679
who is he to you?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.594
He's a friend.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.354
Look, I like Stu.
I do.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.232
But...

21:04.320 --> 21:07.995
we don't have nearly enough guns
or guys who can shoot 'em.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.919
We need all hands on deck,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.673
to protect the town, our kids.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.911
I got to go.
They're waiting to eat.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.673
Sorry, Rachel.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.832
Listen, I got
a pretty full afternoon,

21:44.880 --> 21:48.350
so whatever you're gonna do,
just do it.

21:50.520 --> 21:53.558
I hear you're
a hell of a swordsman.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.876
Not like the rest of those
sheep in town.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.196
If only you hadn't gone back
for that whimpering slut,

21:58.240 --> 22:00.231
you might have
just gotten away.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.153
You thought you had to, right?
Had a moral obligation?

22:05.320 --> 22:07.789
See, but
that's an outdated notion.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.791
'Cause we live
in a different world now.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.393
It's a better one.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.591
Can you--
You can hear yourself, right?

22:15.680 --> 22:18.240
Are you aware
of how creepy you sound?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.192
Ah!

22:23.120 --> 22:27.591
You know, in the old world,
I was a headmaster.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.031
At the Jessup Academy for Boys.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.876
Get this.
The night of the blackout,

22:36.920 --> 22:39.958
the police were coming
to arrest me. Me!

22:40.000 --> 22:42.674
Simply for images
I had on my computer,

22:42.760 --> 22:43.909
for art.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.469
Um...

22:45.680 --> 22:47.512
Yikes.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.750
Titus: But then (SNAPS) no more power.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.518
No more computer.

22:51.640 --> 22:56.635
No police, no law,
and I was born new.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.199
It was a sign.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.954
God wants us to be free

23:01.000 --> 23:02.320
to do whatever we want.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.953
And all the boys in my care,

23:04.000 --> 23:07.356
some of them thousands of miles
from home, they were free too.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.113
Many of them are still with me,

23:09.160 --> 23:11.959
free to do whatever they want,
whenever they want to.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.709
No limits, no rules.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.518
How is that not
a better world?

23:17.600 --> 23:19.159
Yeah.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.359
<i>That whole
Lord of the Flies</i> thing

23:22.440 --> 23:23.635
seems to be
really working for you.

23:23.720 --> 23:27.793
Listen, uh,
if you're gonna kill me,

23:27.840 --> 23:30.480
go ahead and kill me,
just stop talking.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.669
No, no. No, no.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.194
Show him.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.515
Who's that?

23:45.560 --> 23:47.153
The rider your town
sent to Austin.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.550
He was supposed to beg for help.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.551
Beg the rangers
to come save you.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.756
Well, he never made it.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.471
What are you
doing in Texas, anyway?

24:01.280 --> 24:03.556
You mouth-breathers
never make it this far south.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.195
What are you after?

24:10.280 --> 24:12.590
I'm not going to kill you,
by the way.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.710
Not yet.

24:13.800 --> 24:17.031
Okay.
Why not?

24:18.200 --> 24:20.191
That's a surprise.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.596
But I can't risk you murdering
any more of my kids, either.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.399
So I had an impulse.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.310
(SCREAMS)

24:51.200 --> 24:54.079
Hey, buddy!
Can you move this thing?

24:54.120 --> 24:55.599
Be out of here in a minute.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.399
This way, ma'am.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.638
Gun!
Down!

26:14.560 --> 26:16.198
(SCREAMING)

26:18.200 --> 26:20.396
Detain him!
Detain him!

26:54.360 --> 26:55.509
Oh, gross.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.029
Guess you're not as lucky
as I am, huh, pal?

27:27.400 --> 27:28.435
(GUNSHOT)

27:37.480 --> 27:38.993
Help!

27:40.480 --> 27:41.675
Somebody help!

27:43.160 --> 27:47.074
Hey, buddy.
Are you okay--

27:48.280 --> 27:49.509
Ben?

27:50.800 --> 27:53.599
Aaron, it's you.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.638
It's you, Aaron.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.711
What?

27:58.760 --> 28:00.319
Ben?

28:01.120 --> 28:02.633
Wha-- Why?
Oh, my“

28:02.880 --> 28:04.712
Oh, my God.
Oh, my--

28:06.480 --> 28:07.595
Oh, my God.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.757
Cynthia: Aaron?

28:13.320 --> 28:14.310
What's wrong?

28:15.520 --> 28:17.193
What are you doing
on the floor?

28:28.120 --> 28:33.559
Man: Eddie. Prapul. Ador. Kusti.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.876
(MAN CONTINUES SHOUTING)

28:46.960 --> 28:48.633
So what are you
gonna do to me?

28:49.760 --> 28:54.152
Well, you are a complete
pain in the ass.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.277
But...

29:05.760 --> 29:06.989
I don't like killing.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.478
Not unless I have to.

We've got nothing to say
to each other.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.078
I agree.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.518
Carter?

32:41.560 --> 32:42.709
Phil?

32:42.760 --> 32:45.274
They owe me a favor,
a big one.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.710
And they're handy in a fight.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.996
Look, I've never been able
to shake you out of a bad idea

32:51.040 --> 32:52.599
once you get it into your skull.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.309
Just answer me this.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.152
Just forget what he did
for Charlie,

32:58.240 --> 33:00.629
or that you owe him.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.791
Is he worth it?

33:11.840 --> 33:13.114
All right, then.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.359
No.
You are not coming.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.595
Like you're going without me.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.950
Dad!

33:23.040 --> 33:25.919
Don't forget, you come by
your stubbornness honestly.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.350
Aaron: I was holding him.

33:32.440 --> 33:35.592
His blood was on my hands.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.472
I could smell the gunpowder.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.756
Cyn, I'm losing my mind.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.274
That's the only explanation.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.636
Aaron, you've got to stop.
You're driving yourself crazy.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.075
Because crazy
is what's happening.

33:47.760 --> 33:52.072
Okay, look, maybe
there is an explanation.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.390
Maybe this is a miracle.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.430
From God?

33:58.160 --> 33:59.195
Sure, yeah.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.157
Why don't I go and change
water into wine,

34:01.240 --> 34:02.674
and then we can just
have a bitching rager.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.273
Please don't talk
to me like that.

34:05.360 --> 34:09.274
You know, just because I believe
does not make me a whackjob.

34:09.320 --> 34:10.913
I'm sorry.

34:10.960 --> 34:14.793
I know you believe,
but I just don't.

34:20.080 --> 34:24.870
But Cynthia, this isn't
some answered prayer.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.474
Some things are just random.

34:27.560 --> 34:32.509
Ben was just a misfired synapse
in my clearly mushy brain.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.318
You came back from the dead.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.391
Your wounds healed, like magic.

34:45.679 --> 34:46.715
You do?

34:48.520 --> 34:49.715
I don't know why.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.991
I'm not sure there is a why,

34:55.080 --> 34:59.233
other than some malfunction,
but I know what.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.356

Have a seat.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.035
Thank you.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.434
What's your name?

38:36.920 --> 38:37.990
Edgar Crane.

38:39.080 --> 38:43.278
Well, I owe you a great debt
of gratitude, Mr. Crane.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.998
Thank God you showed up
when you did.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.633
On.
(CHUCKLES)

38:46.640 --> 38:49.473
Well, I hope you don't think
that was an accident.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.755
I meant to be there.

38:52.160 --> 38:55.278
I noticed that young man
this morning,

38:55.360 --> 38:59.797
eyeing you like he was
Lee Harvey and you were JFK.

38:59.880 --> 39:04.078
My gut told me to follow him,
so I did.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.310
That's some gut.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.720
This isn't my first rodeo.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.115
I worked security
for the Monroe Militia.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.635
Even met Monroe himself, once.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.394
But that's all in my past.

39:17.760 --> 39:21.719
Now I want to help you.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.589
Is that so?

39:23.680 --> 39:26.320
Oh, in case
you haven't noticed,

39:26.400 --> 39:28.152
you have a security problem.

(JUSTINE CHUCKLES)

39:29.920 --> 39:32.434
I mean, this camp is crawling
with unsavory types,

39:32.480 --> 39:34.391
and you need someone
with their ear to the ground.

39:34.440 --> 39:38.035
I mean, clearly your men do not.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.952
And why should I trust you?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.799
You mean,
besides me saving your life?

39:42.880 --> 39:46.714
After all,
you were Monroe Militia.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.479
I did what I had
to do to survive.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.795
We all did.

39:54.320 --> 39:58.154
But I was born an American,

39:58.240 --> 40:02.711
and I would like, very much,
to be one again.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.590
I'll just have to keep
my eye on you, Mr. Crane.
