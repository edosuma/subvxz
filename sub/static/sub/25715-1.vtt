02:39.098 --> 02:40.973
Listen, I have been fixing
this stereo

02:40.975 --> 02:42.769
since before you were born.

02:44.145 --> 02:46.270
Okay. Move. Move.

02:46.272 --> 02:49.524
Let me get back there before you
blow someone's eardrums.

02:49.526 --> 02:51.108
These guys are coming.

02:51.110 --> 02:53.612
On my way.
Oh, shit!

02:53.614 --> 02:56.822
Mommy, you didn't change
the calendar yet?

02:56.824 --> 02:59.034
Oh! Well, I was waiting for you
to help me. Ready?

02:59.036 --> 03:01.662
- Mm-hmm.
- One, two, big jump!

03:01.664 --> 03:03.288
Oh-ho-ho.

03:03.290 --> 03:06.292
Go for it.
Perfect.

03:06.294 --> 03:10.337
Your, ah, your ideas definitely
gave us a head-start but

03:10.339 --> 03:12.840
you know,
it feels good to be..

03:12.842 --> 03:15.300
kind of doing our own thing.

03:15.302 --> 03:16.968
See anything?

03:16.970 --> 03:20.597
No. Just proof you guys haven't
dusted in about ten years.

03:20.599 --> 03:22.182
Mom says you have to
set the table.

03:22.184 --> 03:23.810
Yeah, after this level.

03:23.812 --> 03:27.023
Your sister will play for you.
Or do you want me to?

03:28.566 --> 03:32.276
I'm coming!

03:32.278 --> 03:34.153
Hey, Dag.

03:34.155 --> 03:36.823
- You know how to play?
- Nope.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.327
Ah!

03:41.121 --> 03:42.540
Dinner bell!

03:43.915 --> 03:45.748
- That should do it.
- What you don't want to..

03:45.750 --> 03:47.209
You don't want to test it first?

03:47.211 --> 03:48.630
No. We're good.

03:50.923 --> 03:53.216
I suppose you're gonna
wanna gloat now.

03:53.218 --> 03:55.551
No, I don't do this
for the recognition.

03:55.553 --> 03:57.471
It's enough for me
that you know.

04:16.575 --> 04:18.868
I can hold my breath under water
for 30 seconds.

04:18.870 --> 04:20.618
- No way.
- Are you kidding me?

04:20.620 --> 04:22.412
But her goal
is an entire minute.

04:22.414 --> 04:23.955
Then you can perform
underwater heists.

04:23.957 --> 04:26.207
A minute,
which her teacher thinks

04:26.209 --> 04:28.669
she's gonna be able to do
by this spring.

04:28.671 --> 04:31.005
Are you guys staying over
till tomorrow, Ethan?

04:31.007 --> 04:33.841
Oh, I wish. We actually
have to head out in a little bit

04:33.843 --> 04:36.427
and get the lab ready
for tonight.

04:36.429 --> 04:37.595
Uh, what's tonight.

04:37.597 --> 04:39.931
Well, with the kind of
energy draw

04:39.933 --> 04:42.893
that we need for the project,
the only safe place

04:42.895 --> 04:44.477
that we can really do it
is at the A.I. lab

04:44.479 --> 04:47.062
which is conveniently
empty tonight.

04:47.064 --> 04:49.189
What about my swim lesson?

04:49.191 --> 04:51.568
Can we have a moment?

04:51.570 --> 04:53.739
- Ethan?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

04:57.534 --> 04:59.283
Listen, I get why you're upset

04:59.285 --> 05:01.286
but please try to understand
where I'm coming from here.

05:01.288 --> 05:04.414
We were just looking forward
to having you home.

05:04.416 --> 05:07.418
Okay. But I'm only an hour away.
It's not like I'm...

05:07.420 --> 05:09.545
We haven't seen you in months.

05:09.547 --> 05:11.796
Months.

05:11.798 --> 05:14.716
Okay. Well, I can..

05:14.718 --> 05:16.385
I'll try to be better
about that. It's just..

05:16.387 --> 05:17.678
I mean, you know
how I get when I...

05:17.680 --> 05:19.930
What about your Aunt Susan?

05:19.932 --> 05:21.558
Who's gonna pick her up
tomorrow?

05:23.938 --> 05:26.188
Ah, I don't know.

05:26.190 --> 05:30.316
You guys gotta figure something
else out, I guess.

05:30.318 --> 05:32.695
You need to get
your priorities straight.

05:34.323 --> 05:37.282
That's exactly
what I'm doing, Dad.

05:37.284 --> 05:39.075
Trust me, classes are over
on the 12th.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.826
And then you guys have me
for the rest of spring break.

05:40.828 --> 05:42.621
But tonight,
you've gotta let me go.

05:42.623 --> 05:44.289
I mean, this is the first chance
we've really had

05:44.291 --> 05:45.707
to test this thing out.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.333
- Please.
- Okay.

05:47.335 --> 05:49.127
Okay.

05:49.129 --> 05:50.838
Yeah. I guess
you better go then.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.634
Thank you for understanding.

05:58.973 --> 06:01.598
Uh, I think
we're gonna head out.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.892
- Don't go yet.
- Mom, thank you for dinner.

06:03.894 --> 06:06.021
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, don't go, Ethan.

06:07.482 --> 06:08.730
See you guys soon, okay?

06:08.732 --> 06:10.983
- I'm sorry.
- You're welcome. It's okay.

06:10.985 --> 06:12.404
We'll see you soon.

06:18.618 --> 06:20.286
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:20.288 --> 06:22.081
No, it's my fault, too.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.862
Hey.

06:57.201 --> 06:58.451
Let's do this.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.918
Hey, tonight's the night,
huh, Lightman?

07:07.920 --> 07:09.086
Keep walking.

07:09.088 --> 07:20.765
Break a leg, bitches.

07:20.767 --> 07:27.396
- Where's the shunt motor?
- The other case.

07:27.398 --> 07:28.608
Careful. Careful.

07:33.739 --> 07:37.741
We call it ELI. Short for
Electromagnetic Induction.

07:37.743 --> 07:39.617
Imagine a world where
your phone never dies

07:39.619 --> 07:42.412
or appliances
come without plugs.

07:42.414 --> 07:43.914
You know,
we have wireless internet

07:43.916 --> 07:46.458
so, why not
wireless electricity.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.670
Our method should have
wireless electricity

07:48.672 --> 07:51.464
in every home within

07:51.466 --> 07:52.798
a decade.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.509
I mean, the same basic
principle we've built upon

07:54.511 --> 07:56.427
has been around
for quite some time

07:56.429 --> 07:59.596
but it's never been
successfully implemented

07:59.598 --> 08:00.975
until tonight.

08:07.482 --> 08:08.650
Here we go.

08:11.194 --> 08:12.570
Signal's looking good.

08:12.572 --> 08:15.366
Starting at 100 RPM.

08:17.368 --> 08:19.659
Come on.

08:19.661 --> 08:21.121
Should something be happening?

08:22.414 --> 08:24.165
Just give it a second.

08:32.592 --> 08:33.549
Come on.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.720
Are you sure the bulb works?

08:36.722 --> 08:38.722
Yes, I'm sure.
Give it a minute.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.350
The signal's all over
the place.

08:43.352 --> 08:45.562
Alright.

08:45.564 --> 08:47.022
Do it..

08:47.024 --> 08:48.525
Now!

08:53.613 --> 08:56.822
- These readings are all wrong.
- What is going on?

08:56.824 --> 08:58.410
Boosting the signal.

09:01.039 --> 09:02.621
Come on. Come on.

09:02.623 --> 09:04.625
Wait.
Do you hear that?

09:08.921 --> 09:10.214
Come on.

09:11.590 --> 09:13.217
Ethan, be careful.

09:16.137 --> 09:17.430
Ethan!

09:20.516 --> 09:29.482
Oh, shit!

09:29.484 --> 09:31.651
Ethan, we've gotta go.

09:31.653 --> 09:34.320
Shit! Shit!

09:41.537 --> 09:44.667
Blackout is campus-wide.
Please respond to building B.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.556
I hope we don't
get in trouble.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.356
- What happened?
- I've no idea.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.776
Okay.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.201
Time to go.

10:24.292 --> 10:26.711
- You see anything?
- I think we're clear.

11:06.835 --> 11:08.921
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:11.424 --> 11:12.675
Can't take a break?

11:14.009 --> 11:17.845
Well, um, not right now.

11:17.847 --> 11:20.472
I have to figure this out.

11:20.474 --> 11:22.683
Stop obsessing.

11:22.685 --> 11:24.810
I'm not obsessed.

11:24.812 --> 11:26.646
What are you doing?

11:26.648 --> 11:27.814
Mean.

11:27.816 --> 11:29.984
Well, figure it out later.

11:31.028 --> 11:33.487
I want to figure it out now.

11:33.489 --> 11:35.780
Let's do something fun.

11:35.782 --> 11:36.616
Okay.

11:37.701 --> 11:39.119
Let's make a tent.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.997
- A tent?
- Yeah.

11:43.999 --> 11:45.290
Alright.

11:49.505 --> 11:50.798
What? One second.

11:52.801 --> 11:54.009
Oh, weird.

11:55.761 --> 11:57.844
- Hello?
- Ethan.

11:57.846 --> 11:58.972
You gotta come home.
There was an accident.

11:58.974 --> 12:01.932
- Yeah. Hold on.
- A truck..

12:01.934 --> 12:04.768
I don't know, a truck crashed
right in front of Mom and Dad.

12:04.770 --> 12:08.105
What.. What..
W... what do you mean?

14:15.866 --> 14:17.908
Matt!

14:17.910 --> 14:19.120
Okay!

14:21.831 --> 14:23.666
Matt, come on.
I mean it!

14:28.795 --> 14:29.796
I need caffeine.

14:31.464 --> 14:34.048
Let's go!
Come on!

14:34.050 --> 14:36.428
The bus is leaving.
Here we go.

14:36.430 --> 14:37.890
I'm in gear.

15:00.037 --> 15:02.203
And, ah, if you have any
problems with it

15:02.205 --> 15:03.416
just let me know.

15:05.001 --> 15:06.958
- All good?
- Yeah.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.961
Just a quarter-inch splitter.

15:08.963 --> 15:10.839
- This came in for you today.
- Oh, thanks.

15:14.009 --> 15:14.968
Oh, thanks.

15:20.016 --> 15:21.057
- See ya!
- Bye, Matt!

15:21.059 --> 15:22.101
See ya!

15:24.104 --> 15:25.896
- Hey.
- What's this?

15:25.898 --> 15:28.066
Nothin'.
Just a part for work.

15:29.652 --> 15:32.112
- School good?
- Yup.

15:37.283 --> 15:39.159
And will he help you
with your homework tonight?

15:39.161 --> 15:40.868
Okay, make sure
you ask him, okay?

15:40.870 --> 15:42.036
- Okay. Bye, Ms. Nash.
- Okay.

15:42.038 --> 15:43.704
Okay. Bye, Becca.
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:43.706 --> 15:45.082
Hey. Ready to go?

15:45.084 --> 15:46.290
- Yeah.
- Alright.

15:46.292 --> 15:49.461
Ah, can I talk to you
for a minute, Mr. Lightman...

15:49.463 --> 15:50.671
- Ethan's fine.
- Okay.

15:50.673 --> 15:52.882
I just wanted to talk to you
about Becca.

15:52.884 --> 15:54.841
Uh, yeah.
What about Becca?

15:54.843 --> 15:57.136
It's just that lately
she seems to be

15:57.138 --> 16:00.141
having some trouble interacting
with the other children.

16:05.938 --> 16:07.772
Look, I just want to help.

16:07.774 --> 16:32.130
Oh, we don't need it.
But thank you.

16:32.132 --> 16:33.425
Ethan!

16:36.762 --> 16:38.554
Hey, Tom.

16:38.556 --> 16:39.806
How're you doing?

16:39.808 --> 16:42.141
I'm alright.
How've you been?

16:42.143 --> 16:43.643
I haven't
seen you around much.

16:43.645 --> 16:46.938
Yeah. They're keepin' me pretty
busy at the power plant.

16:46.940 --> 16:50.107
Yeah.
You guys holdin' up okay?

16:50.109 --> 16:52.611
Uh, yeah. You know, it's..
It's been a..

16:52.613 --> 16:54.404
- It's been rough, but..
- Yeah.

16:54.406 --> 16:56.364
I think we're hanging in there.

16:56.366 --> 16:58.365
But, uh, I should probably
get back to them.

16:58.367 --> 17:01.913
Sure, alright.

17:01.915 --> 17:03.750
Hey.. Hey, listen.

17:07.170 --> 17:11.296
When Karen died a while back,
everybody always said

17:11.298 --> 17:12.758
"You'll get over it."

17:14.594 --> 17:17.596
That's, that's the lie
that people will tell you.

17:18.890 --> 17:21.476
But, uh, it gets better.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.811
I promise.

17:26.606 --> 17:29.857
Anyway, you guys need anything,
you, uh, just let me know, okay?

17:29.859 --> 17:32.318
Yeah, we will.

17:32.320 --> 17:36.155
- Alright, well, um..
- Yeah.

17:36.157 --> 17:37.074
- Okay.
- Alright.

17:37.076 --> 17:38.826
- I'll see you later.
- Uh-huh.

17:48.212 --> 17:51.463
Why was Ms. Nash sad?

17:51.465 --> 17:52.673
What do you mean?

17:52.675 --> 17:58.011
When you talked to her,
she looked sad.

17:58.013 --> 18:00.681
That's 'cause I wasn't
very nice to her.

18:00.683 --> 18:13.194
You should be nice.
I like her.

19:13.676 --> 19:15.218
Matt!

19:17.513 --> 19:20.513
Okay.

19:20.515 --> 19:22.433
- Have a good day.
- You got it?

19:22.435 --> 19:24.352
Don't forget your bag.

19:24.354 --> 19:26.105
- Bye.
- See ya.

19:30.401 --> 19:31.736
Okay.

19:32.947 --> 19:34.987
Don't forget, um,
you've got to..

19:34.989 --> 19:37.281
You've got to go to
your sister's swim practice.

19:37.283 --> 19:39.451
I'm going to pick you both up
there later today, alright?

19:39.453 --> 19:41.285
- Please don't forget.
- Okay.

19:41.287 --> 19:44.998
Please don't touch
my leg next time.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.126
Just say "Okay".

19:47.211 --> 19:49.087
- Okay?
- Okay.

19:50.715 --> 19:51.880
Come on.

19:51.882 --> 19:54.341
- Ah, what's...
- This happened before.

19:54.343 --> 19:55.428
I got it.

19:56.971 --> 19:58.428
- There..
- Perfect. Alright.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.682
Uh, you're all set.

20:00.684 --> 20:03.642
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

20:03.644 --> 20:06.853
- Is everything okay, Ethan?
- Yeah. Sorry, just, um..

20:06.855 --> 20:08.356
Why don't you head home?
Get some down time.

20:08.358 --> 20:10.399
No, I'm fine really. I..

20:10.401 --> 20:13.361
I need the hours,
so I'll stick around.

20:13.363 --> 20:15.281
Are you serious?
It's not even noon yet.

20:15.283 --> 20:17.410
Tuesdays are dead anyway.

20:19.704 --> 20:22.370
Alright.

20:40.892 --> 20:43.851
Ugh..

21:32.195 --> 21:33.778
Hey, Matt.

21:33.780 --> 21:35.905
Milady.
How was school?

21:35.907 --> 21:58.429
Good.

21:58.431 --> 21:59.723
Ready?

22:01.643 --> 22:02.933
Set.

22:32.425 --> 22:35.596
Come on, come on, come on..
Yes.

23:32.780 --> 23:35.155
Just come on,
come on, come on..

23:49.839 --> 23:51.589
No!

23:51.591 --> 23:52.758
Agh!

23:54.386 --> 23:55.595
Okay.

24:02.936 --> 24:04.896
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

24:11.821 --> 24:14.697
Guys, I am so, so sorry.

24:14.699 --> 24:19.284
- How was swim practice?
- Good.

24:19.286 --> 24:21.035
You know, I thought
we'd maybe switch it up tonight.

24:21.037 --> 24:23.205
Maybe make something
for dinner, huh?

24:23.207 --> 24:26.667
How's that sound?

24:26.669 --> 24:36.468
- Can I help?
- Sure you can. Yeah.

24:52.696 --> 24:54.403
That's not how Mom does it.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.741
Okay. Well, then,
what's next?

25:00.163 --> 25:02.580
Too much.

25:02.582 --> 25:05.708
Hey, Matt, can you grab some
sodas from the garage, please?

25:05.710 --> 25:08.209
I want a Doctor Pepper.

25:08.211 --> 25:09.422
Did you hear that?

25:33.905 --> 25:36.573
Then I looked back, and she was
still half the pool away.

25:36.575 --> 25:38.533
What?
That's amazing.

25:38.535 --> 25:41.995
My coach says
I might be part mermaid.

25:41.997 --> 25:45.042
You never know. You could start
growing a tail or something.

25:50.589 --> 25:52.089
Matt, I already apologized,
I don't know what else

25:52.091 --> 25:53.384
you want me to say.

25:55.761 --> 25:58.097
How about apologizing
for why you were late?

26:03.603 --> 26:05.560
Becca, why don't you
give us a second?

26:05.562 --> 26:09.481
You can finish your dinner
in front of the TV if you want.

26:09.483 --> 26:10.902
Okay.

26:23.666 --> 26:26.291
How can you go back to working
on that thing?

26:26.293 --> 26:29.627
This is important to me, Matt.

26:29.629 --> 26:32.589
I'm not just doing this
for me, Matt, okay?

26:32.591 --> 26:34.509
Everyone's gonna want this
technology, okay.

26:34.511 --> 26:36.677
This could really
change things for us.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.097
It did change things. Okay?

26:39.099 --> 26:41.683
- Mom and Dad are dead.
- It was an accident.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.393
They wouldn't have been driving
if you didn't leave

26:43.395 --> 26:46.020
to work on that machine.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.062
Are you saying you,
you preferred

26:47.064 --> 26:48.106
if I died, is that it?

26:48.108 --> 26:49.857
No! You wouldn't have!

26:49.859 --> 26:51.026
Okay, they died
because the truck

26:51.028 --> 26:52.777
crashed right in front
of them.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.863
If... if they'd left earlier,
or later, they'd have been fine.

26:54.865 --> 26:57.741
- You can't know that, Matt!
- Yes, I can!

26:57.743 --> 26:58.908
There's no possible way

26:58.910 --> 27:01.244
you could have left
the exact same time

27:01.246 --> 27:04.956
gone the exact same way,
and... and at the exact speed.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.669
It's impossible. If you'd
stayed, we'd all be here.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.926
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

27:24.813 --> 27:28.482
Alright, bath time, Bec.

27:28.484 --> 27:30.524
Just wash up and then bed.

27:30.526 --> 27:33.029
I'll meet you in your room to
tell you a story or something.

27:34.531 --> 27:37.616
You mean your room.

27:37.618 --> 27:41.078
Well, you can't sleep
on my floor forever, you know.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.415
Tonight, I can though, right?

27:45.542 --> 27:48.170
Yeah.
Okay, tonight you can.

29:29.151 --> 29:34.904
Aw, jeez.

29:34.906 --> 29:35.948
Hey, Marie.

29:35.950 --> 29:37.531
I saw your light
and I thought

29:37.533 --> 29:40.954
you and the kids might want
a little home cooking.

30:13.656 --> 30:16.072
- Anytime.
- Ethan!

30:16.074 --> 30:18.200
Okay. That's my cue.
Um, I gotta go.

30:18.202 --> 30:19.326
- Goodnight.
- Thank you for this.

30:19.328 --> 30:20.493
Goodnight.

30:20.495 --> 30:21.744
What happened?
You okay?

30:21.746 --> 30:22.872
Quit spying on me, Matt!

30:24.082 --> 30:25.540
Are you spying on her?

30:25.542 --> 30:27.000
Oh yeah, I was spying on her.

30:27.002 --> 30:28.876
- I saw you, Matt!
- Okay.

30:28.878 --> 30:30.462
Come out of there.

30:30.464 --> 30:32.006
Let's go get ready for bed.

30:34.136 --> 30:36.344
"But still, others say
the queen kept it"

30:36.346 --> 30:38.972
"to remind herself
of her son's wisdom."

30:38.974 --> 30:42.060
"Still, he couldn't find
a real princess."

31:01.331 --> 31:02.290
Come on.

31:03.541 --> 31:05.374
Please.

31:05.376 --> 31:06.336
Stupid!

31:14.843 --> 31:16.343
Goddammit!

31:26.982 --> 31:30.317
Matt, I'm supposed to be the one
to change the calendar.

31:30.319 --> 31:31.654
Don't look at me.

31:33.030 --> 31:36.615
Well, somebody changed it.

31:36.617 --> 31:37.823
Good morning.

31:37.825 --> 31:38.824
Morning.

31:38.826 --> 31:44.039
Excuse me.

31:44.041 --> 31:45.000
Look, there's Tom.

31:45.959 --> 31:49.044
Oh.

31:49.046 --> 31:49.964
Hey.

32:29.087 --> 32:30.211
More parts for your project?

32:30.213 --> 32:31.839
I wanna see your project.

32:31.841 --> 32:33.008
Yeah?

32:34.344 --> 32:36.093
Okay.

32:36.095 --> 32:39.180
So... imagine walking
in the house

32:39.182 --> 32:40.765
and right away the phone

32:40.767 --> 32:42.558
in your... in your pocket
starts charging.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.269
Or, or powering a light bulb
without a socket.

32:45.271 --> 32:46.938
That's what this machine does

32:46.940 --> 32:47.980
or will be able to do.

32:47.982 --> 32:49.815
It's wireless electricity.

32:49.817 --> 32:51.735
- That's so cool.
- Yeah.

32:51.737 --> 32:52.861
I know.

32:52.863 --> 32:54.987
But how does it work?

32:54.989 --> 32:56.989
Well, we gotta turn it on first.

32:56.991 --> 32:58.534
Do you wanna do it?

32:58.536 --> 32:59.826
Okay.

32:59.828 --> 33:02.872
So just press those two buttons
at the same time.

33:02.874 --> 33:04.125
- These two?
- Yeah. Just like that.

33:05.042 --> 33:08.126
Good. Now this one.

33:08.128 --> 33:10.962
Good. Now, there's one more.
Let me do this.

33:10.964 --> 33:13.884
Um... press that yellow one
for me.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.010
- This one?
- Um-hmm.

33:17.012 --> 33:19.389
Okay, last bit.
Here we go.

33:23.395 --> 33:24.978
Does it work?

33:24.980 --> 33:27.480
Well, yeah.
It's not... it's gonna work.

33:27.482 --> 33:29.818
Very, very soon.
Very, very soon.

33:39.369 --> 33:40.912
I'm calling back later.

33:43.039 --> 33:45.164
Alright. Well, I think
it's time for bed.

33:45.166 --> 33:47.417
You can help me with this
tomorrow, though. I promise.

33:47.419 --> 33:49.338
- Okay.
- Lots of work to be done.

33:50.130 --> 33:50.965
Okay.

34:00.224 --> 34:03.393
Hey, it's me again.

34:03.395 --> 34:08.273
Um, I hope you're also
doing okay.

34:08.275 --> 34:11.404
If there's anything you need,
please let me know.

34:15.614 --> 34:19.286
I'm here for you, and you don't
have to go through this alone.

34:21.121 --> 34:22.873
I'm here whenever you're ready.

34:56.241 --> 34:58.825
That was the play at my school
last year.

34:58.827 --> 35:01.245
This year it's same.

35:01.247 --> 35:07.959
You have to be
in grade four to do it.

35:07.961 --> 35:09.253
Hi, Matt.

35:09.255 --> 35:10.173
Hey... hey, Bec.

35:11.256 --> 35:12.675
Who were you talking to?

35:14.843 --> 35:16.176
Just Mom.

35:16.178 --> 35:17.930
I'm telling her
about the school.

35:21.017 --> 35:22.144
You were talking to Mom?

35:26.315 --> 35:27.313
Maybe.

35:27.315 --> 35:30.692
What do you mean?
Did you see something?

35:30.694 --> 35:33.656
No. Just... playin' around.

35:38.201 --> 35:42.286
Okay. Cool.

35:42.288 --> 35:44.373
Don't... don't stay up
too late, okay?

35:44.375 --> 35:45.458
I won't.

35:52.675 --> 35:54.093
I'll tell you more later.

35:55.427 --> 35:57.220
I love you too.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.932
But when can I tell them?

36:13.823 --> 36:15.154
Ethan!

36:15.156 --> 36:16.489
- Hmm? Oh.
- It's like 7:30!

36:16.491 --> 36:17.908
What?

36:17.910 --> 36:20.035
Oh. Did you eat anything yet?

36:20.037 --> 36:21.745
No, I... I..

36:21.747 --> 36:23.080
Okay, well,
there's not really time now.

36:23.082 --> 36:24.917
Can you just, uh,
just go get dressed?

36:26.919 --> 36:29.502
Is... is... is Becca awake?

36:29.504 --> 36:31.879
I don't know. Can you just
check on her, please?

36:31.881 --> 36:33.133
- Did you change this?
- Um-umm.

36:36.262 --> 36:39.264
- Alright. Go, go, go, go.
- Bye.

36:39.266 --> 36:40.932
Sorry

36:40.934 --> 36:43.351
- Hi, Ms. Nash.
- Hi.

36:43.353 --> 36:47.021
Good thing Ms. Nash loves me.

36:47.023 --> 36:49.316
Are you alright?

36:49.318 --> 36:51.820
You look kinda pale,
like you might be getting sick?

36:57.868 --> 36:58.910
Okay.

37:00.580 --> 37:05.248
Last night, I was
in Mom and Dad's room..

37:05.250 --> 37:06.959
...and..

37:06.961 --> 37:10.256
...I felt something weird.

37:12.133 --> 37:13.426
And then I saw something.

37:15.386 --> 37:17.388
Well, what?
What did... what'd you see?

37:20.307 --> 37:22.060
I think I saw Mom and Dad.

37:25.313 --> 37:28.981
And it... it wasn't just my
imagination or whatever, okay?

37:28.983 --> 37:29.902
I know..

37:34.447 --> 37:36.697
Weird things have
been happening in the house.

37:36.699 --> 37:38.532
Like, last night,
I... I swear to God

37:38.534 --> 37:40.242
there was somebody in my room.

37:40.244 --> 37:43.496
And the date on Mom's calendar
keeps changing by itself.

37:43.498 --> 37:44.456
How do you explain that?

37:44.458 --> 37:48.627
Alright, Matt, Matt,
just stop it, okay?

37:53.968 --> 37:56.470
You can't live in that house
and tell me you don't feel them.

37:59.307 --> 38:01.017
Mom and Dad are still here.

38:02.644 --> 38:05.479
I... I think the minute
you turned on that machine..

38:07.399 --> 38:08.439
Have you ever thought
it might be giving out

38:08.441 --> 38:09.692
some sort of signal?

38:09.694 --> 38:10.858
Yeah! I know it's..

38:10.860 --> 38:12.945
I know it's giving out
a signal, alright?

38:12.947 --> 38:14.487
I'm glad you didn't say any
of this in front of your sister.

38:14.489 --> 38:15.780
You would have scared
the shit out of her.

38:15.782 --> 38:16.991
Becca told me she was talking

38:16.993 --> 38:19.034
to Mom last night..

38:19.036 --> 38:20.496
...right after I saw them!

38:21.913 --> 38:23.873
I think Mom and Dad
are trying to tell us something.

38:25.710 --> 38:27.545
Don't you think
you should listen this time?

38:35.178 --> 38:36.430
Just got to school, Matt.

39:26.481 --> 39:27.565
Weird.

40:10.528 --> 40:12.610
Becca, did you move
Dad's toolbox?

40:12.612 --> 40:13.989
No!

40:20.621 --> 40:22.414
- See you later, Lightman.
- Oh, yeah. Peace.

40:38.473 --> 40:40.642
I wanna sleep in
my room tonight.

40:42.519 --> 40:43.645
Okay.

40:53.613 --> 40:56.366
So, what brought this on?

40:58.369 --> 41:00.288
I'm not scared anymore.

41:01.956 --> 41:03.875
They watch me while I sleep.

41:14.969 --> 41:16.177
Hey.

41:16.179 --> 41:19.179
- What did you say to her?
- What?

41:19.181 --> 41:22.058
Why'd you put that stuff
into her head about Mom and Dad?

41:22.060 --> 41:24.269
What are you talking about?
She brought that up to me.

41:24.271 --> 41:25.687
Matt, don't lie
to me, alright!

41:25.689 --> 41:26.687
If you didn't say anything,
why is she

41:26.689 --> 41:28.732
suddenly sleeping
in her own room?

41:28.734 --> 41:29.649
Isn't that a good thing?

41:29.651 --> 41:31.692
That she's deluded?
No, Matt, it's not!

41:31.694 --> 41:34.154
Ethan, she's not deluded!

41:34.156 --> 41:36.781
Jesus, when are you
gonna wake up and realize..

41:36.783 --> 41:38.785
Mom and Dad don't like it
when you fight.

41:46.543 --> 41:49.172
Ethan, don't be so hard
on your brother.

41:51.674 --> 41:54.592
Sorry, Bec. Yeah, we'll try
to be more quiet, okay?

41:54.594 --> 41:55.804
Just go back to bed.

42:05.647 --> 42:07.146
...are amazing.

42:07.148 --> 42:08.438
What would you expect to pay

42:08.440 --> 42:12.026
for this fine piece
of exercise equipment?

42:12.028 --> 42:15.157
Coming up after the break,
we got "Six In A Row."

42:22.707 --> 42:25.207
Those who believe
in the holy spirit

42:25.209 --> 42:27.792
shall find the path
of righteousness.

42:47.607 --> 42:48.984
It's Mom and Dad.

42:54.447 --> 42:55.949
Now do you believe us?

42:58.285 --> 43:05.874
It's Mom and Dad.

43:05.876 --> 43:06.878
Oh.

44:35.846 --> 44:37.139
Oh!

44:51.110 --> 44:52.487
What happened?

44:53.864 --> 44:55.990
Nothing.
Just dropped something.

45:01.122 --> 45:03.913
It's really good to see you.

45:03.915 --> 45:07.000
Sorry I haven't called.
It's just been nuts.

45:07.002 --> 45:10.337
You know, I drive a mini-van now
and go to PTA meetings.

45:10.339 --> 45:11.633
It's pretty ridiculous.

45:13.008 --> 45:14.466
But, uh, I actually

45:14.468 --> 45:18.011
I wanted to talk to you
about our machine..

45:18.013 --> 45:19.846
...about ELI.

45:19.848 --> 45:21.516
What about it?

45:21.518 --> 45:24.393
Well, I figured since we
practically made it together

45:24.395 --> 45:25.936
you're the only other person
that knows

45:25.938 --> 45:28.690
the technology as well as I do.

45:28.692 --> 45:31.400
You know, our focus was always
on trying to get enough power.

45:31.402 --> 45:35.280
But I think we took for granted
that the signal actually worked.

45:35.282 --> 45:36.822
Well, if you don't
have a signal

45:36.824 --> 45:39.742
you don't have anything.

45:39.744 --> 45:41.661
We... well,
I think it does work.

45:41.663 --> 45:43.415
Just not on light bulbs.

45:51.841 --> 45:53.508
Like, when you feel a presence

45:53.510 --> 45:55.760
or... or when someone says
they see a spirit

45:55.762 --> 45:57.303
and they have
a physical reaction to it

45:57.305 --> 45:59.888
like the hairs on their arm
pricking up

45:59.890 --> 46:02.015
or on the back of their neck.

46:02.017 --> 46:04.227
What if there is a scientific
explanation for that?

46:04.229 --> 46:08.024
Like, a shift in the
electromagnetic energy levels?

46:13.531 --> 46:16.574
Matt, Ethan told us not to turn
it on without his permission.

46:18.703 --> 46:21.246
Well, Ethan's not here.
I'm in charge.

46:22.580 --> 46:33.591
That's not how you do it.

46:44.896 --> 46:47.021
You know our consciousness
has a frequency

46:47.023 --> 46:50.568
so, where does all
that energy go when we die?

46:54.323 --> 46:55.824
I know this sounds crazy.

46:58.703 --> 47:00.453
But, Hannah, there's...
there's stuff

47:00.455 --> 47:01.953
going on in my house, okay?

47:01.955 --> 47:03.830
Stuff that I cannot explain.

47:03.832 --> 47:05.625
It all started
when I turned on the machine.

47:20.683 --> 47:21.810
Ethan, listen to me.

47:22.936 --> 47:26.104
You have to talk
to someone about this.

47:26.106 --> 47:28.023
Look, I came here to have
a serious discussion with you

47:28.025 --> 47:29.566
not to be psychoanalyzed.

47:29.568 --> 47:32.071
A serious discussion
about what, ghosts?

47:33.447 --> 47:34.948
Yeah, this was a mistake.

47:36.325 --> 47:37.785
I gotta get back anyway.

47:38.827 --> 47:40.371
- Ethan.
- Bye, Hannah.

48:07.314 --> 48:08.815
- In here! In here!
- Ethan, watch!

48:08.817 --> 48:10.985
Go again. Go again.

48:13.280 --> 48:14.947
It's so cool!

48:14.949 --> 48:16.365
This is awesome!

48:16.367 --> 48:18.450
Do you see this?

48:18.452 --> 48:19.745
Isn't this amazing?

48:21.998 --> 48:24.122
I know that was
a lot of fun today

48:24.124 --> 48:26.916
but... you guys
have to promise me

48:26.918 --> 48:28.168
you're not gonna
turn on the machine

48:28.170 --> 48:31.130
when I'm not here, alright?

48:31.132 --> 48:32.923
Okay, I promise.

48:32.925 --> 48:34.845
Alright. Goodnight.

48:36.930 --> 48:38.515
- Ethan?
- Yeah?

48:40.725 --> 48:42.059
I really want to see them.

48:43.519 --> 48:45.688
Mom says the signal
needs to be stronger.

49:56.513 --> 50:00.014
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:00.016 --> 50:01.643
For now, we keep this
top secret.

50:03.103 --> 50:05.436
We can't tell anybody
what we're up to, not even Dag.

50:05.438 --> 50:06.980
Okay?

50:06.982 --> 50:09.024
Yeah.

50:09.026 --> 50:10.274
And I'll talk to Becca too.

50:10.276 --> 50:11.734
I don't know how
this is gonna affect her

50:11.736 --> 50:15.321
but... I've opened
some kind of door

50:15.323 --> 50:18.408
whether I like it or not.

50:18.410 --> 50:21.077
But if there's a chance
we can talk to Mom and Dad

50:21.079 --> 50:22.456
we gotta try.

50:24.166 --> 50:25.457
There's still a long way to go.

50:25.459 --> 50:27.251
I can't really seem
to strengthen the signal.

50:27.253 --> 50:30.171
Every time I try cranking up
the power, I trip the breaker.

50:32.800 --> 50:36.261
Shit.

50:36.263 --> 50:37.556
So, what are you gonna do?

50:47.190 --> 50:49.609
Welcome to my workshop.

50:52.321 --> 50:55.947
I was half expecting
to find a DeLorean in here.

50:55.949 --> 50:59.117
- I wish.
- How much is it pullin'?

50:59.119 --> 51:01.037
Uh, a lot. A lot.

51:01.039 --> 51:02.997
I just, I can't seem
to get enough juice

51:02.999 --> 51:04.289
without blowing the breaker.

51:04.291 --> 51:07.126
And I thought maybe
you'd have some..

51:07.128 --> 51:09.211
...secret tricks
that you could show me.

51:10.965 --> 51:12.423
Well, there's lots of ways
of nabbin' power

51:12.425 --> 51:13.840
from your neighbor's houses

51:13.842 --> 51:17.260
but, uh, it's pretty complicated

51:17.262 --> 51:18.555
super illegal.

51:19.599 --> 51:21.223
Right.

51:21.225 --> 51:23.102
We could probably rig
somethin' up temporary.

51:24.145 --> 51:26.272
- Yeah?
- Let's hit the basement.

51:36.283 --> 51:37.826
Hey, Bec.

51:39.535 --> 51:42.161
Were you talking
to Mom and Dad again?

51:42.163 --> 51:46.209
Yeah, I was just telling them
about my new friend..

51:46.211 --> 51:47.504
...Alice.

51:49.130 --> 51:51.132
They don't think
I should talk to her.

51:53.258 --> 51:54.760
Really?

51:57.222 --> 52:00.684
So, do Mom and Dad
actually talk to you?

52:02.226 --> 52:04.017
Like, full conversations?

52:04.019 --> 52:05.269
Kind of.

52:05.271 --> 52:08.188
W... why don't,
why don't they talk to me?

52:08.190 --> 52:09.401
You're not ready yet.

52:12.238 --> 52:13.614
What does that mean?

52:14.906 --> 52:17.910
- That's what Mom says.
- And Dad?

52:19.285 --> 52:20.743
What does Dad say?

52:20.745 --> 52:22.245
I don't know.

52:22.247 --> 52:24.165
He just wants us to make
the machine work better.

52:34.677 --> 52:36.510
- That should do it.
- Alright.

52:36.512 --> 52:39.431
You'll have access to most
of your house's power with this.

52:39.433 --> 52:41.432
You're gonna wanna
re... replace it

52:41.434 --> 52:42.559
with something more
permanent eventually

52:42.561 --> 52:44.601
but should be fine
for now.

52:44.603 --> 52:46.688
No. This is, this is perfect.

52:46.690 --> 52:48.440
I knew you'd have something
up your sleeve.

52:48.442 --> 52:50.691
Just remember, you wanna ramp
this thing up

52:50.693 --> 52:52.612
you turn most of the things
off in your house.

52:54.405 --> 52:56.405
Even a little bit
of an overdraw

52:56.407 --> 52:58.408
it's enough to trip
the whole system.

52:58.410 --> 53:00.202
You're gonna wanna make
a few adjustments

53:00.204 --> 53:01.370
inside there too.

53:01.372 --> 53:03.580
Make sure it can handle
the power, huh?

53:03.582 --> 53:05.999
Yeah, I've definitely
got my work cut out for me

53:06.001 --> 53:08.127
that's for sure.

53:08.129 --> 53:09.919
Maybe some day you'll tell me

53:09.921 --> 53:12.423
if this time machine of yours
actually works, huh?

53:12.425 --> 53:14.841
Well, I'll need a
few more gigawatts for that

53:14.843 --> 53:17.178
but I'll let you know.

53:17.180 --> 53:19.846
Well, I'll, uh, see you around.

53:19.848 --> 53:21.226
I'll walk you out of here.

53:38.826 --> 53:40.661
Okay.

53:40.663 --> 53:42.496
What do you think?

53:42.498 --> 53:44.792
Modified the design,
made it a little bit simpler.

53:46.378 --> 53:47.501
Bec, look!

53:47.503 --> 53:48.962
What do you think?

53:50.465 --> 53:52.339
Huh?

53:52.341 --> 53:54.341
Does that mean
it'll work better?

53:54.343 --> 53:56.343
Yeah, I hope so.

53:56.345 --> 53:58.720
- That's the idea.
- Can we switch it back on now?

53:58.722 --> 54:00.597
No, not yet.
Very soon, though.

54:11.194 --> 54:12.696
I need extra help on cash.

54:14.364 --> 54:17.324
Ah, here we go.
That's what we need.

54:17.326 --> 54:20.911
One, two, three, four.
That's probably good, right?

54:20.913 --> 54:24.373
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

54:29.629 --> 54:31.256
- Yo, yo!
- Hey.

54:34.677 --> 54:36.054
What happened in here?

54:36.930 --> 54:38.762
You forget to pay the bills?

54:38.764 --> 54:40.640
Uh, new house rule.

54:40.642 --> 54:42.642
Use as little power as possible.

54:42.644 --> 54:45.063
Okay.

54:47.733 --> 54:49.651
I'm not supposed to tell you
but..

54:51.153 --> 54:53.528
...I think my Mom and Dad
might be back.

54:53.530 --> 54:55.280
Yeah, right.

54:55.282 --> 54:57.366
I'm serious.

54:57.368 --> 55:00.536
- A... are they here right now?
- Yeah.

55:00.538 --> 55:01.622
Where? Show me.

55:02.832 --> 55:05.623
Well, the machine's not on.

55:05.625 --> 55:08.502
- I think he's working on it.
- Convenient.

55:09.672 --> 55:12.464
I'm telling the truth, Dag.
I swear to God.

55:12.466 --> 55:14.467
- Mrs. Lightman?
- Shut... shut up!

55:15.511 --> 55:17.680
Come on. I'll show you
how to beat that level.

55:25.688 --> 55:27.231
Becca!

55:28.566 --> 55:29.900
Becca!

55:29.902 --> 55:31.526
Show time!

55:31.528 --> 55:32.821
I'm in the bath!

56:06.522 --> 56:08.149
Quicker. Quicker.

56:30.715 --> 56:38.846
Here we go.

57:04.375 --> 57:05.668
Why'd you do that?

57:44.833 --> 57:47.169
Hey. You okay?

57:51.549 --> 57:53.715
Where's Lulu?

57:53.717 --> 57:55.177
I gave her to Alice.

57:56.554 --> 57:58.304
Oh.

57:58.306 --> 58:00.600
I don't think
I've met Alice yet, have I?

58:01.601 --> 58:03.186
She's shy.

58:03.978 --> 58:06.478
I'm her only friend.

58:06.480 --> 58:07.982
Oh, okay.

58:09.568 --> 58:12.276
Um... alright.

58:12.278 --> 58:13.697
Well, goodnight.

58:16.825 --> 58:18.533
Ethan?

58:18.535 --> 58:20.995
Hmm?

58:20.997 --> 58:23.622
Does the machine work?

58:23.624 --> 58:24.542
Not yet.

58:26.126 --> 58:31.754
But it will. I promise.

58:31.756 --> 58:35.217
Oh, hello.

58:35.219 --> 58:36.388
Dude, check this out.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.346
- You know your hot neighbor?
- Yeah.

58:39.348 --> 58:40.848
Yeah, she's changing
in her bedroom

58:40.850 --> 58:43.183
and curtains are wide open.

58:43.185 --> 58:44.435
What?

58:44.437 --> 58:45.770
Where?

58:45.772 --> 58:48.147
She... she was, she was
right there. Um..

58:48.149 --> 58:49.648
- You idiot!
- What?

58:49.650 --> 58:51.775
Dude... dude, I swear.

58:51.777 --> 58:53.402
- Come on. She was..
- Yeah.

58:53.404 --> 58:55.279
What? You were getting turned on
by a hat rack?

58:55.281 --> 58:57.742
Dude, it was
a woman's rack, okay?

58:57.744 --> 58:59.827
Yeah, right.

58:59.829 --> 59:01.289
Whatever. I'm gonna go
take a leak.

59:02.331 --> 59:03.872
Yeah, make sure
that's all you do.

59:03.874 --> 59:05.793
Ha, ha. Very funny, asshole.

01:00:13.321 --> 01:00:23.080
Dag?

01:00:29.879 --> 01:00:30.881
Dag!

01:00:32.425 --> 01:00:33.800
Dag!

01:01:31.904 --> 01:01:34.989
Jesus! Tom! Tom.

01:01:36.241 --> 01:01:37.951
God, you scared me.

01:01:38.993 --> 01:01:40.161
Hey.

01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:47.211
I need to know.

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.758
What's that machine of yours
really do?

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:57.347
Well, um..

01:01:59.724 --> 01:02:02.225
...the technical term
is electromagnetic induction...

01:02:02.227 --> 01:02:03.645
Ethan!

01:02:04.979 --> 01:02:07.982
Do not lie to me.

01:02:16.658 --> 01:02:18.201
Your machine..

01:02:19.828 --> 01:02:21.996
...has a radius beyond
this house.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.503
I thought it was
some mental thing.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:32.550
Leftover guilt from,
from having moved on.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:36.721
What have you seen?

01:02:40.934 --> 01:02:42.602
My wife.

01:03:07.669 --> 01:03:09.588
She killed herself..

01:03:13.009 --> 01:03:21.974
...right here in this house.

01:03:21.976 --> 01:03:23.228
Truth is..

01:03:25.063 --> 01:03:27.148
...I've always felt
like she was still here..

01:03:29.443 --> 01:03:35.697
...watching me.

01:03:35.699 --> 01:03:37.617
Turns out I was right.

01:03:53.926 --> 01:03:55.845
She never left me.

01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:06.125
- Alright. Have a good one.
- Bye.

01:05:06.127 --> 01:05:07.710
See ya.

01:05:07.712 --> 01:05:09.753
Hey, Ethan, do you have a sec?

01:05:09.755 --> 01:05:11.088
Oh, yeah.

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:13.090
She's doing a lot better
since we last spoke.

01:05:13.092 --> 01:05:15.717
Good. Yeah, she told me
she made a new friend.

01:05:15.719 --> 01:05:18.012
Someone named Alice.

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:20.765
Oh. Yeah, she's mentioned Alice
to me too.

01:05:20.767 --> 01:05:23.017
I, I assumed
she was a relative.

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.852
Why's that?

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:27.023
Well, Becca said
that she lives with you.

01:05:36.908 --> 01:05:38.827
Hey, Jacob, uh..

01:05:39.787 --> 01:05:41.413
...do you believe in ghosts?

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:45.667
I... do... not.

01:05:50.005 --> 01:05:53.467
Hey, Bec, can you tell me
a little bit more about Alice?

01:05:55.636 --> 01:05:58.179
Well, she's really nice.

01:05:58.181 --> 01:06:00.639
She used to live where we live.

01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:02.268
- You mean at our house?
- Yep.

01:06:04.895 --> 01:06:09.399
Did she start visiting after
Ethan turned on the machine?

01:06:09.401 --> 01:06:10.858
I think so.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.779
She's always hiding on me,
though.

01:06:13.572 --> 01:06:15.363
Why?

01:06:15.365 --> 01:06:17.782
'Cause she's afraid of Henry.

01:06:17.784 --> 01:06:19.660
That's why I gave her Lulu..

01:06:19.662 --> 01:06:24.622
...to protect her.

01:06:24.624 --> 01:06:26.499
Who's Henry?

01:06:26.501 --> 01:06:28.836
I don't know.
I haven't met him yet.

01:06:41.685 --> 01:06:51.234
Hannah!

01:06:51.236 --> 01:06:52.988
Hey, Bec!

01:06:53.864 --> 01:06:55.196
Come here.

01:06:55.198 --> 01:06:56.282
I missed you.

01:06:56.284 --> 01:06:58.325
- Hey, what's up?
- I missed you.

01:06:58.327 --> 01:06:59.412
Hey, Matt.

01:07:00.662 --> 01:07:03.539
Can you please take that inside,
and Becca?

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:05.460
- Come on, Bec.
- I'll be in there in a second.

01:07:06.543 --> 01:07:08.045
You're staying for dinner,
right?

01:07:10.298 --> 01:07:12.380
It's up to you.

01:07:12.382 --> 01:07:20.140
- Yeah.
- Yes!

01:07:20.142 --> 01:07:22.477
Um, I need
to show you something.

01:07:25.855 --> 01:07:28.230
I had Adnan send me the video.

01:07:28.232 --> 01:07:30.778
After watching it a few times,
I noticed something.

01:07:34.406 --> 01:07:36.575
Okay, that'd be my shadow.

01:07:38.368 --> 01:07:39.995
Yours, and what's that?

01:07:48.088 --> 01:07:51.338
So, it's always done this,
since day one.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.508
More power seems to intensify
the signal.

01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:58.595
Oh, God. Hannah, I think the
signal's reaching beyond the house.

01:07:58.597 --> 01:08:00.347
And since I've realized that,
I... I've been too afraid

01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:02.182
to turn it back on.

01:08:02.184 --> 01:08:04.103
I mean, Tom saw his dead wife.

01:08:06.898 --> 01:08:08.439
It's one thing
bringing my parents back

01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:09.857
but I'm pretty sure
everyone else

01:08:09.859 --> 01:08:11.569
would rather
their loved ones stay dead.

01:08:12.571 --> 01:08:14.071
But what makes you so sure

01:08:14.073 --> 01:08:15.741
you're interacting
with your parents?

01:08:17.033 --> 01:08:18.700
I mean, what if the machine
isn't bringing

01:08:18.702 --> 01:08:20.283
people back exactly

01:08:20.286 --> 01:08:22.995
just amplifying the energy
that's already there?

01:08:22.997 --> 01:08:25.332
We're not just encountering an echo,
if that's what you're saying.

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:28.754
I mean, Becca's had entire
conversations with my parents.

01:08:29.796 --> 01:08:31.841
- And Alice.
- Alice?

01:08:35.095 --> 01:08:36.510
You just gave me an idea.

01:08:36.511 --> 01:08:38.470
Who's Alice?

01:08:38.473 --> 01:08:39.930
Let's find out.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.283
Uh... hm.

01:08:57.702 --> 01:09:00.411
Your parents bought
the house

01:09:00.412 --> 01:09:02.330
from a family..

01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:05.584
Oh. It's..

01:09:06.752 --> 01:09:09.210
The Szerbiaks.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:11.006
And they moved to Michigan,
I think.

01:09:11.923 --> 01:09:15.300
And before the Szerbiaks

01:09:15.301 --> 01:09:16.553
it was..

01:09:18.345 --> 01:09:19.890
Hm.

01:09:19.892 --> 01:09:24.394
It was Diane and Frank Evans?

01:09:24.395 --> 01:09:26.523
Frank worked
at my father's practice.

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:31.986
Do you remember anyone
ever living there named Alice?

01:09:36.325 --> 01:09:38.327
Where did you hear that name?

01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:42.622
I haven't looked at these
in so long.

01:09:43.538 --> 01:09:46.707
That's me, Jo-Jo Gold

01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:48.002
and Alice.

01:09:49.046 --> 01:09:51.087
Alice lived at your house

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:52.841
with Mr. and Mrs. Gifford.

01:09:53.968 --> 01:09:55.553
She was their foster child.

01:09:58.348 --> 01:09:59.682
One day..

01:10:01.643 --> 01:10:02.769
...she disappeared.

01:10:04.396 --> 01:10:05.938
The police looked for her.

01:10:06.939 --> 01:10:09.607
We all did.

01:10:09.609 --> 01:10:12.820
But she was never found.

01:10:12.822 --> 01:10:16.447
There was never any evidence
to prove anything

01:10:16.449 --> 01:10:18.491
but the police
were convinced

01:10:18.493 --> 01:10:22.081
that Mr. Gifford
had done something to Alice.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.894
Dag?

01:10:48.859 --> 01:10:51.358
Technical difficulties.
I'm re-spawning.

01:11:40.204 --> 01:11:43.123
Do you remember
Mr. Gifford's first name?

01:11:44.041 --> 01:11:45.209
Oh.

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:49.962
Uhm.

01:11:49.964 --> 01:11:51.299
Henry!

01:11:52.634 --> 01:11:54.633
Henry.

01:12:59.245 --> 01:13:00.538
Found you!

01:13:09.129 --> 01:13:12.547
Help!

01:13:24.854 --> 01:13:26.106
Becca!

01:13:39.286 --> 01:13:41.328
Becca!

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:43.748
Stop!

01:14:01.309 --> 01:14:02.682
Ethan!

01:14:02.684 --> 01:14:03.976
Hey, are you okay?

01:14:03.978 --> 01:14:05.727
- Hey. Hey, where's Becca?
- Yeah..

01:14:05.729 --> 01:14:08.274
Ethan, Matt, help!

01:14:10.569 --> 01:14:12.611
- Becca! Where are you?
- Becca?

01:14:12.613 --> 01:14:14.696
- Becca!
- Becca!

01:14:14.698 --> 01:14:16.490
Becca, where are you?

01:14:16.492 --> 01:14:18.325
- Becca!
- Bec!

01:14:18.327 --> 01:14:20.244
- Becca!
- Becca, are you okay?

01:14:20.246 --> 01:14:22.579
- Where are you?
- Becca!

01:14:22.581 --> 01:14:24.080
Ethan!

01:14:24.082 --> 01:14:25.540
- Help!
- Oh, God.

01:14:25.542 --> 01:14:28.544
- Help!
- Why are they doing this?

01:14:28.546 --> 01:14:30.504
It's not them.
It's not Mom and Dad.

01:14:30.506 --> 01:14:33.340
- What do you mean?
- It's not Mom and Dad!

01:14:44.812 --> 01:14:45.980
No.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.819
Ethan, help!

01:14:53.821 --> 01:14:55.363
She's in here.

01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:56.782
Help!

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.033
- Becca!
- Where am I?

01:14:59.035 --> 01:15:08.209
Becca!

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:29.857
Becca!

01:16:24.833 --> 01:16:27.377
It's a tunnel.
Becca!

01:16:29.879 --> 01:16:30.964
Matt!

01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:35.551
- What do you see?
- Bec!

01:16:38.013 --> 01:16:39.348
Hold on!

01:16:41.392 --> 01:16:43.350
I'm coming!

01:16:45.021 --> 01:16:46.645
Matt!

01:16:46.647 --> 01:16:47.814
Are you okay?

01:16:54.572 --> 01:16:56.030
Tom?

01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:03.165
Matt, can you see Becca?

01:17:07.461 --> 01:17:08.838
Becca!

01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:12.299
Where are you?

01:17:17.722 --> 01:17:18.889
Tom?

01:17:28.024 --> 01:17:29.692
Becca?

01:17:54.093 --> 01:17:55.427
Becca?

01:17:57.137 --> 01:17:58.720
Matt!

01:17:58.722 --> 01:18:00.098
I found her!

01:18:20.245 --> 01:18:22.996
Do not come any closer.
I mean it.

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:24.081
Look, you don't know
what you're doing.

01:18:24.083 --> 01:18:26.582
- Walk away, Ethan.
- Move.

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:34.927
Hey.

01:18:37.681 --> 01:18:39.014
Becca.

01:18:42.727 --> 01:18:44.437
Turn around.

01:18:48.817 --> 01:18:51.236
Let her go!
Becca!

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:54.945
- No! Stop!
- Ah!

01:19:09.589 --> 01:19:10.756
Becca!

01:19:12.925 --> 01:19:14.674
- Hannah!
- Ah!

01:19:14.676 --> 01:19:20.848
Hannah!

01:19:25.439 --> 01:19:29.148
Becca, who's doing this?

01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:30.735
Henry.

01:19:45.293 --> 01:19:47.712
Hannah! Hurry!

01:20:01.226 --> 01:20:02.974
Please. Tom!

01:20:02.976 --> 01:20:05.268
I can't lose her again.

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:08.023
No. You can't go back!
Remember?

01:20:08.025 --> 01:20:13.694
You can't go back! Argh!

01:20:16.032 --> 01:20:18.158
Becca!

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.493
Becca, wake up.

01:20:19.495 --> 01:20:22.287
Please wake up..
Becca..

01:20:30.088 --> 01:20:32.172
Listen to me, Tom!
Listen to me.

01:20:32.174 --> 01:20:36.010
They're gonna kill Becca.
They're gonna kill her!

01:20:42.352 --> 01:20:45.272
That thing's not Karen!
She's gone!

01:21:18.346 --> 01:21:20.264
Ethan!

01:21:52.092 --> 01:21:54.341
Matt! Becca!

01:22:05.271 --> 01:22:07.064
Gentle.

01:22:07.066 --> 01:22:10.234
Hey. Becca. Come on.

01:22:10.236 --> 01:22:11.819
- Becca.
- Becca.

01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:13.654
- Becca. Becca.
- Hey. Becca.

01:22:13.656 --> 01:22:14.779
- Becca.
- Come on.

01:22:18.869 --> 01:22:21.369
- Matt? Hannah?
- Hey.

01:23:12.632 --> 01:23:17.594
Okay.

01:23:47.754 --> 01:23:49.672
Well, well, well..

01:23:50.507 --> 01:23:52.297
We're finally all done here.

01:23:52.299 --> 01:23:54.175
Great. Okay.
We'll follow you.

01:23:54.177 --> 01:23:56.385
- You got the address, right?
- Yepper. Um-huh.

01:23:56.387 --> 01:23:59.555
And guess what I found upstairs?

01:23:59.557 --> 01:24:01.015
This.

01:24:01.017 --> 01:24:03.475
And I'm guessing that this
belongs to you, little lady.

01:24:03.477 --> 01:24:06.021
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

01:24:07.524 --> 01:24:09.442
Alright, boys.

01:24:30.755 --> 01:24:34.217
- I'll help you unpack later.
- Alright. Sounds good.

01:24:38.515 --> 01:24:41.182
Um..

01:24:41.184 --> 01:24:44.730
So, I just wanted to say
thank you.

01:24:45.939 --> 01:24:47.647
Any time.

01:24:52.571 --> 01:24:55.406
- I'll see you at 8:00.
- Bye.

01:25:26.106 --> 01:25:28.607
Oh! Ethan, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Wait.

01:25:30.526 --> 01:25:32.985
Oh, I couldn't believe
you'd go.

01:25:32.987 --> 01:25:36.406
Bye. Bye, bye.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

01:25:36.408 --> 01:25:38.949
Bye, Matt.
Becca, sweetheart.

01:25:38.951 --> 01:25:40.452
- You be safe now.
- Okay. I will.

01:25:40.454 --> 01:25:42.244
- Okay.
- Alright. Take care.

01:25:42.246 --> 01:25:43.500
Bye.

01:25:55.303 --> 01:25:56.676
Alright.

01:26:00.099 --> 01:26:03.266
This place is going to be
amazing for you guys.

01:26:03.268 --> 01:26:05.060
Yeah, and only ten minutes
from school.

01:26:06.857 --> 01:26:08.816
- Ethan, guess what.
- What?

01:26:08.818 --> 01:26:11.776
Matt says there's a pool
two blocks away.

01:26:11.778 --> 01:26:13.361
- Did he really tell you that?
- Um-hm.

01:26:13.363 --> 01:26:15.321
After I told him
that was gonna be a surprise?

01:26:15.323 --> 01:26:17.156
Are you serious?

01:26:17.158 --> 01:26:18.950
Dude, come on.

01:26:18.952 --> 01:26:21.455
But, yes,
I'm also a psychopath.

01:26:23.248 --> 01:26:25.457
Have you guys checked
for secret rooms yet?

01:26:25.459 --> 01:26:27.420
Matt..
Matt, no.

01:26:28.545 --> 01:26:30.628
Too soon.

01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:33.340
Dr. Phil says humor is
a healthy method for recovery.

01:26:33.342 --> 01:26:34.425
- Is that show still on?
- Who's Dr. Phil?

01:26:34.427 --> 01:26:36.177
Dr. Phil is...

01:26:36.179 --> 01:26:37.678
She doesn't even know
who that is.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.804
Can you get the door?

01:27:05.799 --> 01:27:09.295
