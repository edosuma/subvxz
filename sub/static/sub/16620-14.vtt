00:21.040 --> 00:23.140
Tina, wrap it up, huh?

00:23.170 --> 00:24.840
You've been at
the touch tank forever.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.770
But I haven't even touched
the sea cucumber.

00:26.810 --> 00:28.010
He's playing hard to get.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.126
Have you done
the penny crusher yet?

00:29.150 --> 00:30.610
Yeah, but I didn't have a penny,

00:30.650 --> 00:32.110
So I crushed our house key.

00:32.150 --> 00:34.580
So, yeah, I think we've done
all there is to do here.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.180
Oh, hi, judy. Feeding time, huh?

00:36.220 --> 00:39.120
No. Just doing a detail job
on the urchin's anus.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.820
Good work if you can get it.

00:40.860 --> 00:42.420
Sure is, but it looks like

00:42.460 --> 00:44.160
I won't be able
to do it much longer.

00:44.190 --> 00:46.660
Why? Did the sea urchin learn
how to brush its own anus?

00:46.700 --> 00:48.800
No. The aquarium
is shutting down.

00:48.830 --> 00:50.270
Wait, what? Huh? Makes sense.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.800
The aquarium is shutting down?

00:51.840 --> 00:53.640
I know. But why?

00:53.670 --> 00:55.840
Well, it's never been
much of a moneymaker,

00:55.870 --> 00:57.970
And this year I can't
even pay my taxes.

00:58.010 --> 01:00.610
But the aquarium can't close.
We love this place. Right?

01:00.640 --> 01:01.840
I mean, right?

01:01.880 --> 01:04.379
Eh, we're not as
touchy-fishy as you are.

01:04.410 --> 01:05.480
Nobody is.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.820
Have you considered
making more money?

01:07.850 --> 01:10.320
I have. That's why I expanded
the key chain section.

01:10.350 --> 01:12.120
To include my handmade jewelry.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.520
They make great gifts.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.960
Well, I mean, they make gifts.

01:14.990 --> 01:16.490
You just need more people
in here.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.236
We could try to rustle up
some customers for you.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.630
We do it all the time
for our family's restaurant.

01:20.660 --> 01:22.060
Hey, guy walking by,

01:22.100 --> 01:23.900
Do you love aquariums?
Sure you do.

01:23.930 --> 01:26.370
I can tell by the way you're
avoiding eye contact with me.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.300
You, lady with the stroller.

01:28.340 --> 01:30.486
Want to take a break and
sit down for the low, low price.

01:30.510 --> 01:32.810
Of four dollars for adults,
two dollars for kids under 12?

01:32.840 --> 01:34.480
No? Okay.

01:34.510 --> 01:36.980
Then it's your fault this place
is closing. Monsters.

01:37.010 --> 01:40.080
And... We cleared
the entire block.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.520
Okay, have a good one.

01:42.550 --> 01:44.250
Wait, they tipped you
eight dollars?

01:44.290 --> 01:46.090
Yup. Geez. That's a huge tip.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.490
I-I don't get tips like that.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.660
Of course not.

01:48.690 --> 01:50.020
Wait, why "of course not"?

01:50.060 --> 01:51.330
Oh, nothing. Never mind.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.590
No. What do you mean, lin?

01:52.630 --> 01:54.760
Sometimes you can
come off a little surly.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.070
What? I'm not surly. Eh.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.600
May I suggest gruff?

01:58.640 --> 02:01.370
Well, you're not conventionally
charming, you know?

02:01.400 --> 02:02.940
And-and charming's
what gets tips.

02:02.970 --> 02:04.246
Uh, I think
you're charming, bob.

02:04.270 --> 02:05.240
Thank you, teddy.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.510
That one time. Mm.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.280
I'm just saying
if you wanted some help.

02:08.310 --> 02:11.210
With your customer relations,
I could give you some pointers.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.510
Uh, I can turn on the charm
if I want to, lin.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.350
I can get tips. Big tips.

02:15.390 --> 02:17.420
Why don't you, uh,
show us what you got?

02:17.450 --> 02:18.590
Okay. I will.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.120
All right.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.060
So, how's everyone
doing this afternoon,

02:22.090 --> 02:24.060
This late afternoon?

02:24.090 --> 02:25.260
Great, thanks.

02:25.300 --> 02:28.230
So, uh, the, uh,
the food is good?

02:28.260 --> 02:29.900
Yes, it is... Good.

02:29.930 --> 02:31.930
Has anyone seen
the weather outside today?

02:31.970 --> 02:34.640
I-I hear it was...
It was windy earlier.

02:34.670 --> 02:35.940
And then not so windy now.

02:35.970 --> 02:36.940
Uh-huh.

02:36.970 --> 02:38.140
Are you okay?

02:38.170 --> 02:40.440
Yeah. I was just leaning
casually on the...

02:40.480 --> 02:41.980
I don't know where to lean.

02:42.010 --> 02:44.550
I'm gonna go let you eat.
I'm gonna leave now.

02:44.580 --> 02:46.150
Oh, my god, that was horrible.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.320
Terrible.

02:47.350 --> 02:48.980
You made everyone
so uncomfortable.

02:49.020 --> 02:49.980
Everyone.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.490
All right, I get it.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.220
Ah, you just need a
little tune-up, is all.

02:53.260 --> 02:56.220
Luckily, I'm an expert,
so you're in good hands.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.460
Do not ask us to work
because we've been hustling.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.130
Our little tushes off
all morning.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.500
Oh, yeah? Where you been?

03:01.530 --> 03:03.330
At the aquarium.
It's shutting down.

03:03.370 --> 03:04.900
You mean the key chain store?

03:04.930 --> 03:06.000
It's an aquarium.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.276
Oh, the little one by the ferry?

03:07.300 --> 03:08.940
Man, I haven't been
there in forever.

03:08.970 --> 03:11.440
No one has. That's why
they can't pay their taxes.

03:11.470 --> 03:13.570
Wait, aren't aquariums
nonprofits?

03:13.610 --> 03:16.510
It's really a key chain
store with fish.

03:16.550 --> 03:18.280
And you're a body odor
store with burgers.

03:18.310 --> 03:20.150
Tina! Sorry. Sorry, dad.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.580
It's too bad they're not a
church or a place of worship.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.320
Then they'd be tax-exempt.

03:24.350 --> 03:25.990
Wait, churches don't pay taxes?

03:26.020 --> 03:28.290
Churches don't pay taxes,
but they're hard to heat,

03:28.320 --> 03:29.790
So it balances out.

03:29.830 --> 03:31.860
Interesting. Right, tina?

03:31.900 --> 03:33.690
I mean, I guess.

03:33.730 --> 03:36.130
I never thought about heating
costs for churches, but sure.

03:36.170 --> 03:37.830
High ceilings,
all those windows...

03:39.240 --> 03:40.940
Not the heating part.
The other part.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.100
Cooling costs?

03:42.140 --> 03:43.470
Ugh. Just come with me.

03:44.870 --> 03:47.380
And they walk you through it.

03:47.410 --> 03:48.840
In 12 to 25 easy steps,

03:48.880 --> 03:50.880
You could become
a tax-exempt place of worship.

03:50.910 --> 03:53.820
The church of aquaticism.

03:55.650 --> 03:58.220
Make up a religion?
I don't know.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.790
Hey, look, I'm not much
of a lyin' brian myself,

04:00.820 --> 04:03.190
But if it means keeping
this place open, then we'll do.

04:03.230 --> 04:04.836
What we got to do and take it
to our graves, right?

04:04.860 --> 04:06.460
So, judy, are you in?

04:06.500 --> 04:09.300
Everybody lies on the internet.
It is not a big deal.

04:09.330 --> 04:10.970
I figured that out the hard way.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.800
Just because a man's e-mail
address has tony danza in it.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.140
Does not mean he's tony danza.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.370
So?

04:17.410 --> 04:18.810
All right.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.315
Let's do it. Yeah.
<i>Who's the boss</i> now?

04:20.339 --> 04:21.440
Wait, what are we doing?

04:24.240 --> 04:27.140
Oh, making up a religion
to get out of paying taxes...

04:27.170 --> 04:28.940
This is giving me queasy knees.

04:28.980 --> 04:30.886
Yeah, that's how you know
you're doing the right thing.

04:30.910 --> 04:31.940
Keep going.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.350
Okay, last question.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.810
"Please provide a brief history
of the church."

04:35.850 --> 04:37.050
I don't know.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.620
All right, all right.

04:38.650 --> 04:41.950
Aquaticism has been making waves
and touching lives.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.820
For over 30 years.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.830
It's been a beacon of light
for lost souls ever since.

04:46.860 --> 04:48.830
Our founders
first put fingers to fish.

04:48.860 --> 04:50.200
Judy, type faster, huh?

04:50.230 --> 04:53.370
"First put fingers to fish" and?

04:53.400 --> 04:54.830
And felt a wave of fulfillment.

04:54.870 --> 04:56.370
And connection and peace.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.640
And a place to go after school.

04:57.670 --> 04:58.716
Judy, could you type
a little faster?

04:58.740 --> 04:59.810
Okay, okay. Oh, boy.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.470
And... Submit.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.516
Sort of surprised you didn't
want to read over it again,

05:03.540 --> 05:04.680
But bing, bam, boom.

05:04.710 --> 05:07.010
Congratulations, everyone.

05:07.050 --> 05:08.510
So... Is this place
a church now?

05:08.550 --> 05:09.820
Did we save the aquarium?

05:09.850 --> 05:11.080
I think we did.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.490
What do we got here?

05:15.520 --> 05:17.820
Aquaticism... All right.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.420
What? Nothing.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.866
That was easy.
What should we do next?

05:20.890 --> 05:22.390
Manipulate the stock market?

05:22.430 --> 05:23.860
What's this?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.500
"Thank you for your application.

05:25.530 --> 05:27.070
"An agent will be in contact.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.740
With you to arrange
an inspection"?

05:29.770 --> 05:31.740
Well played, irs. Oh, my god!

05:31.770 --> 05:33.940
Judy, it's a curve ball,
sure, but we can do this.

05:33.970 --> 05:35.340
What if we can't?

05:35.380 --> 05:36.840
We could get in serious trouble.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.580
Who's "we," grown-up? What?

05:38.610 --> 05:40.186
Don't listen to him,
even though he's right.

05:40.210 --> 05:41.950
Look at me.
Technically, you only.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.220
Have to pass for a church
for what? Like, ten minutes?

05:44.250 --> 05:45.850
You can do that, can't you?

05:45.890 --> 05:47.190
Um... Just got to.

05:47.220 --> 05:48.720
Give this aquarium
a church-over.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.420
Plus a believable
bible and a brief.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.120
But compelling
religious service.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.290
Judy, you got this, right?
We're gonna skedaddle.

05:54.330 --> 05:55.560
Wha...? No, no, no, no.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.960
Gene and louise and I will help.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.300
We'll help every step
of the way.

05:58.330 --> 06:00.270
And when there's only
one set of footprints,

06:00.300 --> 06:02.000
It means we stopped helping.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.740
Bob, watch this;
Watch what I do.

06:05.770 --> 06:07.140
Charm school's in session.

06:07.170 --> 06:09.310
I call this the
tiny tap with a hon.

06:09.340 --> 06:11.210
How's the burger, hon? Great.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.780
All right, hon.

06:12.810 --> 06:14.880
Three-dollar tip minimum,
I guarantee it.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.720
Okay. So you touch customers.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.220
Yeah. And I say "hon."

06:18.250 --> 06:20.290
But it's different if I
do it than if you do it.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.720
What? That's sexist.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.990
Try it. Try it on me.

06:23.020 --> 06:24.220
Okay.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.490
Ew. What was that?

06:25.530 --> 06:26.890
What? I just touched
your shoulder.

06:26.930 --> 06:28.336
It's like you put
a wet lizard on me.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.800
Do it again; Do it better.

06:29.830 --> 06:31.330
Say... and say "hon." okay.

06:31.370 --> 06:32.560
Hon. Ugh.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.670
What? You know what?

06:33.700 --> 06:35.070
Don't touch anybody.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.640
Okay. Did I say the
"hon" right? Or...

06:36.670 --> 06:37.940
No. All right, fine.

06:37.970 --> 06:39.116
I'm gonna go wipe
something down.

06:39.140 --> 06:40.610
Ew. With your wet hands.

06:40.640 --> 06:41.916
Kids, wh-what are you doing
over there?

06:41.940 --> 06:43.110
Making a religion. What?

06:43.140 --> 06:44.680
Doing homework. Oh.

06:44.710 --> 06:45.956
Fake religion homework.
Wha... wait, what?

06:45.980 --> 06:47.210
Nothing.

06:48.620 --> 06:49.950
I got to say, this place looks.

06:49.980 --> 06:51.420
Pretty much like an aquarium.

06:51.450 --> 06:53.170
With a couple of
religious signs slapped up.

06:54.990 --> 06:56.020
But it's not, right?

06:56.060 --> 06:57.960
What? No. I mean, it was,

06:57.990 --> 06:59.660
But it-it's not; It's a church.

06:59.690 --> 07:01.536
I mean, we're trying to get it
registered as a church.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.660
Flanley? Is that your name? Yes.

07:03.700 --> 07:06.100
Is that... Mexican? No.

07:06.130 --> 07:08.870
Huh. Would you like to
meet our youth group?

07:08.900 --> 07:10.140
Uh, oh, okay.

07:10.170 --> 07:12.300
This is the aquaticism
youth group.

07:12.340 --> 07:13.470
The groupers.

07:13.510 --> 07:14.770
They should talk. Now.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.270
Yeah, we're the groupers.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.956
Our youth group is very active
in the church.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.440
You know,
it's a wonderful church.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.710
So wonderful.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.280
And such a church.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.956
Go ahead, agent flanley,
you can ask me anything.

07:23.980 --> 07:25.150
In front of the youth group.

07:25.190 --> 07:26.380
Oh, um...

07:26.420 --> 07:28.350
I need to see some
aquaticism literature.

07:28.390 --> 07:29.636
Oh, we just finished
the literature.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.690
I mean, reading it.
It's so good.

07:31.730 --> 07:33.460
Eh, it's a little preachy.

07:33.490 --> 07:35.030
Uh... Yep. Ye... see it? Yep.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.860
So you saw that. Well,
I got a glimpse of it.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.130
Did you see the drawings?

07:38.170 --> 07:39.400
Ooh-la-la.

07:39.430 --> 07:40.870
And that formatting.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.670
Well, that's about it.
Oh, great.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.170
For the easy questions.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.070
Onto the tough stuff. Oh, great.

07:47.110 --> 07:51.140
Okay, yesterday, in charm
school, you were... Horrible.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.010
I-I wasn't that bad. You were,

07:53.050 --> 07:55.550
But fortunately for you,
I had an idea.

07:55.580 --> 07:57.520
We go with "fun teasing guy."

07:57.550 --> 07:59.180
No touching, just fun teasing.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.420
I-I can do that.

08:00.450 --> 08:01.766
I mean, I think I
already do that,

08:01.790 --> 08:03.560
But tell me what you
think I should do.

08:03.590 --> 08:05.590
First of all, when you're
talking to the customers,

08:05.630 --> 08:07.030
You give 'em the business.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.690
A smidge of the business,
like this.

08:08.730 --> 08:09.900
Watch this, watch me.

08:09.930 --> 08:11.500
Hey, teddy, slow down.

08:11.530 --> 08:12.860
Your stomach called.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.830
It said your mouth needs
to chew your food.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.370
My stomach called.

08:19.410 --> 08:21.040
Ah. That's a good one, lin. Eh.

08:21.070 --> 08:22.770
Wow, it worked on teddy.

08:22.810 --> 08:24.240
Bob. Charm school.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.710
Do it. Go do it.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.250
Uh, okay.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.580
Hey, h-how's everybody doing?
Pretty good.

08:29.620 --> 08:32.419
We're celebrating marty's birthday.
Mm-hmm.

08:32.450 --> 08:34.350
He wanted a burger. Mm-hmm.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.120
Well, by the looks of marty,

08:36.159 --> 08:38.960
It, uh, it may be
his-his last one.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.760
Right?

08:40.789 --> 08:42.289
What, do you think that's funny?

08:42.330 --> 08:44.430
What? No. I'm gonna die soon?

08:44.460 --> 08:46.146
No. I'm-i'm just giving you
the business, sir.

08:46.170 --> 08:47.470
Just a smidge.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.130
Send over the girl
that touches you.

08:49.170 --> 08:51.240
Get outta here. Okay. Lin!

08:51.270 --> 08:54.140
<i>So, when you say</i> "does
your church have."

08:54.170 --> 08:56.110
A distinct
ecclesiastical government,".

08:56.140 --> 08:58.080
You mean, do we...

08:58.110 --> 09:01.110
We do, of course,
have all those things.

09:01.150 --> 09:02.780
So much. Almost too much.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.580
Hey, have we shown you
the touch tank yet?

09:04.620 --> 09:06.420
Okay, we can come back
to that question.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.150
And a bunch of the other ones.

09:08.190 --> 09:09.890
Let me tell you about
this touch tank.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.936
You could come in here no matter
what kind of day you had,

09:11.960 --> 09:13.906
No matter what tammy told
jocelyn you did in p.E.,

09:13.930 --> 09:15.606
That you really did
but hoped no one saw...

09:15.630 --> 09:17.006
Not nose-picking,
just a quick pick...

09:17.030 --> 09:18.246
You can put your hands
in the tank.

09:18.270 --> 09:19.760
For a little while,

09:19.800 --> 09:21.446
And it's like you're a starfish
in a tide pool.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.770
And nothing bothers a starfish
in a tide pool...

09:23.800 --> 09:25.070
Except me touching it.

09:25.110 --> 09:26.340
You should give it a whirl.

09:26.370 --> 09:27.610
No, no, no, no, no.

09:27.640 --> 09:28.840
I don't, I don't think so, no.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.480
You might like it,
agent flanley.

09:30.510 --> 09:31.910
Yeah, get in there.

09:31.950 --> 09:33.610
All right, all right,
for a second.

09:33.650 --> 09:35.910
Oh, that is brisk.
Pick up a cucumber.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.350
Oh, oh. Ooh.

09:37.380 --> 09:38.920
Sorry about that. Sorry.

09:38.950 --> 09:41.350
I touched your sea cucumber. Oh.

09:41.390 --> 09:43.960
Wow! Are they, uh, are they
supposed to be this ugly?

09:43.990 --> 09:45.490
Or, or is it sick?

09:45.530 --> 09:46.930
Who's to say?

09:46.960 --> 09:48.606
It's true that they're
not very attractive,

09:48.630 --> 09:50.100
And they move very slowly.

09:50.130 --> 09:51.446
But you know why sea
cucumbers are great?

09:51.470 --> 09:53.330
Uh, no, I don't,
I don't know why.

09:53.370 --> 09:55.870
Because they eat the stuff that
no one else in the ocean wants.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.270
And what they poop out is
cleaner than what they take in.

09:58.310 --> 10:00.370
So basically, these ugly-
slash-beautiful creatures.

10:00.410 --> 10:02.310
Just go along,
constantly making things better.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.880
Than when they found it.

10:03.910 --> 10:06.710
I think we could all learn
from the sea cucumber.

10:06.750 --> 10:08.180
Let me tell you something.

10:08.220 --> 10:09.710
You would not believe the crap.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.520
That people try
to pass off as religions.

10:11.550 --> 10:13.520
Yeah.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.890
I mean, how gullible does
everyone think I am?

10:15.920 --> 10:18.520
But this religion, What
you've got here...

10:18.560 --> 10:19.820
Is special. It is?

10:19.860 --> 10:21.060
It is.

10:21.090 --> 10:23.960
It's beautiful and thoughtful.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
It's answering questions
I didn't even know I had.

10:27.030 --> 10:28.070
Totally, bro.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.330
All right, well, here you go.

10:29.370 --> 10:31.140
These are all the
tax documents you need.

10:31.170 --> 10:32.840
As an official place of worship.

10:32.870 --> 10:34.540
You're all set. Really?

10:34.570 --> 10:35.910
You remember where you parked?

10:35.940 --> 10:36.910
Uh, do you need help
to your car?

10:36.940 --> 10:37.980
Judy, do you validate?

10:38.010 --> 10:39.340
Only spiritually.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.180
Okay.

10:41.210 --> 10:45.520
Well, this is good-bye, I guess.
Good-bye.

10:45.550 --> 10:47.220
Yes... You know, i...

10:47.250 --> 10:49.490
I can't shake the feeling.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.890
That I somehow belong here.

10:51.930 --> 10:54.890
Okay, then. E-mail us anytime.
Oh, look at this.

10:54.930 --> 10:57.330
Your church has
some neat activities lined up.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.060
Singles mixer tomorrow.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.570
That sounds fun.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.770
Oh. Is that tomorrow?

11:02.800 --> 11:05.370
Actually, I think that
schedule's wrong, judy.

11:05.410 --> 11:09.240
All the singles...
Died and then, um...

11:09.280 --> 11:11.586
You know, if it's okay with
you, I-i'd love to dip my toes.

11:11.610 --> 11:14.350
Into aquaticism, so to speak,

11:14.380 --> 11:17.350
And maybe come back
tomorrow, off the clock.

11:17.380 --> 11:19.350
Not as agent flanley,
just as roger.

11:19.390 --> 11:21.850
It's not my name; It's
just what I would come back as.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.760
I'm kidding.
Not about coming back.

11:23.790 --> 11:25.860
I'm coming back.
But about my name.

11:25.890 --> 11:27.090
My name is roger.

11:27.130 --> 11:28.860
So many jokes all of a sudden.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.060
Yeah, well, I guess I'm nervous.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.630
I'm not! Can I interject?

11:32.670 --> 11:35.070
We will see you tomorrow, roger.
If that's your name.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.140
I had trouble following
your very funny joke.

11:37.170 --> 11:39.940
Great! Okay, well, I can't wait
to meet more of the congregation.

11:39.970 --> 11:41.656
At the singles mixer. Bye! I'll see you
tomorrow night! No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

11:41.680 --> 11:43.810
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Crap.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.580
We don't have a congregation.

11:45.610 --> 11:46.910
Right. Crap.

11:46.950 --> 11:48.510
But we're all single!

11:51.730 --> 11:54.036
Guys, lying about having a fake
church is probably immoral.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.760
And lying to the irs
is definitely illegal.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.600
Singles mixers are not illegal,

11:58.630 --> 12:01.670
But if they're good,
they are immoral, am I right?

12:01.700 --> 12:03.670
Dad, come on. We're saving
a small-time aquarium.

12:03.710 --> 12:06.410
And saving souls.
Maybe. You don't know.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.240
It sounds like a really,
really bad idea.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.680
I'm in! Wait, what?

12:09.710 --> 12:11.050
Bless you, mother.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.280
Eh, it sounds fun.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.710
Singles mixer for a good cause.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.050
Let's go. Why not?

12:15.080 --> 12:16.720
Uh, because it's fraud?

12:16.750 --> 12:18.290
Right? Anybody? What?

12:18.320 --> 12:20.750
Don't you want to say
you saved an aquarium?

12:20.790 --> 12:23.520
You owe it to the fish. With
all those poops you've flushed.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.130
Into the ocean. That's
not how flushing works,

12:26.160 --> 12:28.060
But, fine, I'll go.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.030
Mort, teddy, what do you say?

12:30.070 --> 12:32.100
Are you kidding?
I was born single.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.770
I was gonna pick up my mom
at the airport tomorrow night,

12:34.800 --> 12:36.440
But she can take a cab.

12:36.470 --> 12:38.870
She's not that blind. I mean,
she can still see shapes.

12:38.910 --> 12:41.540
And, remember, you're
all devout aquaticists.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.780
Did I hear something
about a singles mixer?

12:43.810 --> 12:45.610
Because I'm seeing someone
right now,

12:45.650 --> 12:48.320
But I'm always stacking backups!

12:49.790 --> 12:51.420
Pretty convincing mixer, huh?

12:51.450 --> 12:53.420
It's awkward and sad.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.660
That feels right.
We might be good here.

12:55.690 --> 12:57.090
C-can I ask you something?

12:57.130 --> 12:59.160
Where did you find
this amazing jewelry?

12:59.200 --> 13:01.160
It's like fish but jewelry.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.830
I love it. You love the jewelry?

13:03.870 --> 13:06.270
Yeah. Nobody loves the jewelry.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.270
You know, I make it myself.

13:08.300 --> 13:11.270
You made all these? Did you go
to jewelry school or something?

13:11.310 --> 13:14.110
No. Did you go to irs school?

13:14.140 --> 13:17.750
You wish.
You know what, now I'm worried.

13:17.780 --> 13:19.410
This might be going too well.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.420
That guy is having
way too much fun.

13:21.450 --> 13:24.490
Isn't that good? No. He's
never going to leave.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.490
He's gonna want to come back
week after week.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.420
To services that don't exist.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.590
How long do we have to keep
coming to this place?

13:30.630 --> 13:32.676
Are we gonna have to raise
our children in this church?

13:32.700 --> 13:34.830
Ah! Guys, we got to make him.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.930
Reconsider a life of aquaticism.

13:36.970 --> 13:39.670
Hello, all. Agent flanley,
you are really starting.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.876
To get into this religion, aren't you?
You know, I'm n...

13:41.900 --> 13:44.040
I'm not gonna lie, I'm...
I-i am feeling it.

13:44.070 --> 13:45.710
Yeah. Okay. Just so you know,

13:45.740 --> 13:48.310
Aquaticism isn't for everyone.

13:48.340 --> 13:50.640
Because our baptism ceremony is,

13:50.680 --> 13:53.550
Well, let's just say,
challenging.

13:53.580 --> 13:54.850
Challenging? How so?

13:54.880 --> 13:56.620
To join aquaticism,
you have to...

13:56.650 --> 13:58.450
Submerge yourself
in the jellyfish tank.

13:58.490 --> 14:00.650
Oh, god, you do?
Yeah. D... Judy.

14:00.690 --> 14:03.390
Don't... Don't... No, I mean you...
Oh, boy, do you.

14:03.430 --> 14:05.890
Yeah. Don't jellyfish sting?

14:05.930 --> 14:07.660
Oh, you better believe it.

14:07.700 --> 14:10.400
They sting and sting and
sting and sting ow.

14:10.430 --> 14:12.246
And sting and sting and sting!
Ah. Ah. Ow, ow, ow.

14:12.270 --> 14:13.570
It's awful!

14:13.600 --> 14:15.800
It's like circumcision
for your whole body,

14:15.840 --> 14:17.400
Except your penis.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.910
But it's the only way
to show you're truly dedicated.

14:19.940 --> 14:21.586
And also you can't eat
ice cream, you can't go.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.356
To the movies, and you have
to sleep in your jeans.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.550
So, yeah, that's aquaticism
for ya. Have fun at the mixer!

14:26.580 --> 14:28.520
That should do it.

14:28.550 --> 14:30.750
Hello. I'm bob.

14:30.790 --> 14:32.690
Hello. I'm linda.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.860
I noticed you
sauntering over here.

14:34.890 --> 14:37.090
Yeah, I noticed
you drinking over here.

14:37.130 --> 14:38.760
Uh, a lot.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.700
Seems like a single fella like
you is using his charm on me.

14:41.730 --> 14:44.100
Is that what I'm seeing?
I might be making.

14:44.130 --> 14:46.370
A charm-esan sandwich, yeah.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.770
I love sandwiches.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.040
Yeah, well,
you smell like you do.

14:50.070 --> 14:53.040
Thank you. You smell,
uh, interesting.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.040
You got a toothbrush at home
or you still shopping around?

14:56.080 --> 14:57.950
How 'bout I, uh, use yours?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.950
I have to say... Bob, was it?

14:59.980 --> 15:02.280
My charm alarm is
ringing off the hook.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.950
Should I let it go to voice
mail and we keep talking?

15:04.990 --> 15:08.290
So, wait, it's an alarm
that has voice mail?

15:08.320 --> 15:09.690
I don't... Get it.

15:09.730 --> 15:11.430
Hello, single people
at this mixer.

15:11.460 --> 15:12.860
Who I've never met before,

15:12.900 --> 15:16.060
Or if we have met,
it was casually at services.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.300
I'm teddy. Hi, teddy. I'm bob.

15:18.330 --> 15:21.070
Looking good.
I mean, it's rather tight.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.900
It's from prom. Not my prom.

15:22.940 --> 15:25.570
So, who wants a drink?
You? You? You?

15:25.610 --> 15:27.640
I'll have one! All right.
How 'bout you, bob?

15:27.680 --> 15:29.740
You want a drink?
You look like you could use one.

15:29.780 --> 15:31.486
Why don't you loosen up?
It's a mixer, I don't...

15:31.510 --> 15:33.580
You know what I mean?
Teddy, calm down.

15:33.620 --> 15:35.580
What? It's fine, bob. It's fun.

15:35.620 --> 15:37.650
It's not fun.
No, it's fun! He's...

15:37.690 --> 15:40.150
Well, he hit me on the shoulder,
so I didn't like that.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.620
I'm gonna go...
Look at some fish.

15:42.660 --> 15:44.460
Oh, my god! I love this song!

15:44.490 --> 15:46.890
Hey, who wants to touch
the crabs in my touch tank?

15:49.300 --> 15:52.000
Linda, look at this! It's
called a tuscaloosa twister!

15:52.030 --> 15:54.840
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ooh!

15:54.870 --> 15:57.600
So violent and
uncomfortable-looking! Yep!

15:57.640 --> 16:00.270
May I cut in? You get the
hell out of here, mort!

16:00.310 --> 16:01.510
Dancing away!

16:01.540 --> 16:03.280
I-is it always like
this at the church,

16:03.310 --> 16:05.110
So fun, so positive?

16:05.150 --> 16:07.110
It sure is, probably!

16:07.150 --> 16:08.780
Well, then I am ready.

16:08.820 --> 16:11.350
You're taking off your shoes.
That's fun.

16:11.390 --> 16:14.190
'Kay. Oh, you're taking off your...
Shirt.

16:14.220 --> 16:16.460
Yeah. I'm sure there's
a reason for that.

16:16.490 --> 16:17.760
There we go.

16:17.790 --> 16:19.690
Okay, I have a question.

16:19.730 --> 16:22.030
Why did you take off
all your clothes?

16:22.060 --> 16:25.930
Because I am ready
to face my fears.

16:25.970 --> 16:28.100
I am ready to join aquaticism!

16:28.140 --> 16:29.340
Oh.

16:29.370 --> 16:32.270
I am ready
to get into that jellyfish tank!

16:32.310 --> 16:33.910
Yeah! Let's all get tanked!

16:37.140 --> 16:39.540
No, that's a bad idea. They'll sting you.
No, I know, I know.

16:39.570 --> 16:41.810
I want them to. I mean, I don't.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.240
But I want to experience it.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.880
I want to join the church.

16:44.910 --> 16:46.386
Aw, that's beautiful,
but, you know what,

16:46.410 --> 16:48.050
I-I don't think it's, um...

16:48.080 --> 16:49.780
stinging season.

16:49.820 --> 16:51.396
I don't know if I'll have
the nerve another time.

16:51.420 --> 16:53.420
It's-it's got to be now!

16:53.450 --> 16:56.120
Okay, so do I go into shock?
Is there a medic on hand?

16:56.160 --> 16:57.390
Uh, there's a mortician.

16:57.420 --> 16:59.890
Hello!
I'm not sure what's happening.

16:59.930 --> 17:03.230
Okay. Here we go. One! Two!

17:03.260 --> 17:04.260
Aquaticism!

17:05.970 --> 17:07.829
It's fake! It's fake!
It's all fake!

17:07.869 --> 17:10.470
It's not a real religion! We
lied to get out of paying taxes!

17:10.500 --> 17:12.569
Hey, they're not stinging me.

17:12.609 --> 17:14.810
Wait, did you just say
it's all fake?

17:14.839 --> 17:18.410
No. Come on out.
Your skin's gonna get all pruny.

17:18.450 --> 17:22.150
No, seriously. Did you just say
aquaticism is a fake religion?

17:22.180 --> 17:23.750
Can you please just get out?!

17:23.780 --> 17:26.750
We can talk about this
outside the jellyfish tank!

17:26.790 --> 17:29.020
Don't try to change the subject,
judy!

17:29.060 --> 17:31.260
Irs guy! Get out of the tank!

17:31.290 --> 17:32.760
So is this whole place fake?!

17:32.790 --> 17:34.530
Are the jellyfish fake, too?

17:34.560 --> 17:36.536
I guess they are, because
I'm not even getting stu...

17:36.560 --> 17:39.160
Oh! Oh! Oh, god! Oh!

17:43.840 --> 17:46.040
Agent flanley, there are
some children here for you.

17:46.070 --> 17:47.710
Did you order three children?

17:47.740 --> 17:50.710
Hmm. No, I didn't.
But send them down.

17:50.740 --> 17:53.210
Must be nice.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.950
So, you guys are
here because...?

17:55.980 --> 17:57.966
We heard you're not gonna
prosecute judy for tax fraud.

17:57.990 --> 18:00.950
Which is very generous. I mean,
the aquarium is still closing

18:00.990 --> 18:04.560
'cause business stinks, but
better than going to jail. Yay.

18:04.590 --> 18:06.830
So we came to give you
this "we're sorry" card.

18:06.860 --> 18:08.390
We didn't mean
for you to get hurt.

18:08.430 --> 18:10.236
We just wanted you to believe
the church was real.

18:10.260 --> 18:13.330
And then you joined it. And
then we didn't know what to do.

18:13.370 --> 18:16.500
Man, we must have done quite a
job to make a smart guy like you.

18:16.540 --> 18:18.740
Believe in our fishy shtick.

18:18.770 --> 18:21.670
Well, in retrospect,
there were red flags.

18:21.710 --> 18:24.510
Really,
everything was a red flag.

18:24.550 --> 18:26.380
Even our red flags? Yeah.

18:26.410 --> 18:28.580
I guess I was just blinded...
By judy.

18:28.620 --> 18:31.350
I mean, she's just really great.

18:31.390 --> 18:34.090
Wait, you had a crush on judy?

18:34.120 --> 18:36.320
I did. I thought
I was into aquaticism,

18:36.360 --> 18:38.490
But I guess I was into judy.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.060
You should call her! Go to her.

18:40.090 --> 18:41.730
Nah. She doesn't want to see me.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.400
Plus, I'm very busy.

18:43.430 --> 18:45.500
Excuse me while I apply
my medicated lotion.

18:45.530 --> 18:48.670
Roger, could you not do that?
It's just the smell. I'm sorry.

18:48.700 --> 18:51.170
Right, right. I guess
I'll just itch and be in pain.

18:51.210 --> 18:54.040
Thank you.
Okay. We about done here, kids?

18:54.070 --> 18:56.540
No, wait, roger,
don't give up on judy.

18:56.580 --> 18:58.226
We may have made a mess
of a fake religion,

18:58.250 --> 19:00.050
But you two sea cucumbers
took it in.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.050
And maybe pooped out love.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.380
Or at least a date. Possibly?

19:04.420 --> 19:06.790
No. As we say in the irs,

19:06.820 --> 19:08.590
That case is closed.

19:09.620 --> 19:10.920
Thanks for coming!

19:10.960 --> 19:13.690
Yes! A ten-dollar tip!
Look at this.

19:13.730 --> 19:16.430
Linda,
look at this ten-dollar bill.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.430
Well, how about that, huh?

19:18.470 --> 19:20.270
You're like
a runaway charm train.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.100
Ooh, excuse me.
Hello. And welcome.

19:22.140 --> 19:23.400
Right this way.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.740
Wow. Look at bob, huh?

19:24.770 --> 19:26.370
Getting the big tips. Kinda.

19:26.410 --> 19:28.040
That last table
left him two bucks,

19:28.080 --> 19:29.440
And I swapped it out for a ten.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.040
The poor schmuck needed a win.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.556
Especially now
that we're dating, right?

19:32.580 --> 19:35.550
Just kidding,
just kidding. Right?

19:35.580 --> 19:38.880
So, judy, you think you might
want to give roger a chance?

19:38.920 --> 19:41.550
Oh, I'm sure he was
just being nice.

19:41.590 --> 19:44.560
He doesn't want to go out
with a tax cheat like me.

19:44.590 --> 19:47.790
We're just gonna take a little
trip to the beach. That's all.

19:47.830 --> 19:48.930
Hi, judy.

19:48.960 --> 19:49.800
Roger?

19:49.830 --> 19:51.830
I thought I smelled that lotion.

19:51.870 --> 19:54.170
Y-you know, I-i didn't get
a chance to say some things.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.000
The last time we saw each other.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.740
Yeah, those paramedics
were in such a rush.

19:58.770 --> 20:00.740
I had a thought.
That's why I came over.

20:00.770 --> 20:02.470
You could keep this place
in business.

20:02.510 --> 20:04.080
By renting it out for parties.

20:04.110 --> 20:05.580
Like the aquaticism party.

20:05.610 --> 20:06.980
But with less tax fraud.

20:07.010 --> 20:08.250
You think that would work?

20:08.280 --> 20:09.580
Yeah, it's a thought.

20:09.620 --> 20:10.920
Might help your bottom line.

20:10.950 --> 20:12.320
That's accounting talk.

20:12.350 --> 20:14.590
A-also, kind of unrelated,

20:14.620 --> 20:18.420
Would you ever want to get
a cup of coffee with me, maybe?

20:18.460 --> 20:21.760
I mean, we could each get
our own coffee, not just.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.160
One cup, where we're both trying.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.500
To drink out of it
at the same time...

20:25.530 --> 20:28.330
Okay. Let's do it!
The two-cup thing.

20:28.370 --> 20:31.770
Or the one. Either one.
I'm open. Great!

20:31.810 --> 20:33.670
I mean, we could do
the two now and then...

20:33.710 --> 20:35.610
Is this going well?
I can't tell.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.310
This is going really well.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.810
I got to say, tina, I didn't get
what you saw in this place.

20:39.850 --> 20:42.810
But I-i kind-kinda get it now.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.880
Mm-hmm. You guys want to
stay for a little while.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.050
And kinda jellyfish out?

20:48.090 --> 20:50.160
I call that one.
Oh, wait, that one's dead.

20:50.190 --> 20:51.736
I'm gonna look at this one.
Gene, you want.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.330
To look at that one? On it!

21:04.740 --> 21:07.040
<i>Hey, hey, hey!
Linda, look at this!</i>

21:07.070 --> 21:08.740
<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>
