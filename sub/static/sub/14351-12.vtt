00:15.080 --> 00:18.246
Captain's log, stardate 5121.5,

00:18.416 --> 00:21.702
orbiting the second planet
in the Minarian star system.

00:21.878 --> 00:25.044
This star has long given evidence
of entering a nova phase,

00:25.214 --> 00:28.168
and six months ago,
a research station was established

00:28.342 --> 00:33.384
to make close-up studies of the star
as its end approaches.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.970
Minara is now entering
a critical period

00:39.144 --> 00:41.849
and the Enterprise has been ordered
to evacuate the station

00:42.022 --> 00:45.188
before the planet
becomes uninhabitable.

00:45.358 --> 00:48.359
Yet our attempts
to contact the station's personnel

00:48.528 --> 00:52.276
have been, so far, unsuccessful.

00:52.448 --> 00:57.573
Dust. Apparently these instruments
have not been recently used.

00:58.287 --> 00:59.947
Record tape.

01:00.122 --> 01:03.622
Maybe it'll tell us something
about the personnel that lived here.

01:05.794 --> 01:07.787
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
Come in, please.

01:07.963 --> 01:10.288
- Kirk here. What is it, Enterprise?
- Scott here, sir.

01:10.757 --> 01:13.295
Our instruments have picked up
a gigantic solar flare

01:13.468 --> 01:16.754
with very high levels of cosmic rays
accompanying it.

01:17.180 --> 01:19.885
- How bad?
- An enormous one.

01:20.058 --> 01:23.806
Our sensors indicate the cosmic-ray
concentration measures 3.51

01:23.978 --> 01:25.057
on the Ritter scale.

01:25.229 --> 01:28.266
That'll play the very devil
with the crew as well as the ship.

01:28.441 --> 01:31.644
At that rate,
it will take exactly 74.1 solar hours

01:31.819 --> 01:34.226
- for the storm to pass.
- Get that ship out of here.

01:34.405 --> 01:36.812
Stay at minimum distance
for absolute safety.

01:36.991 --> 01:39.778
- Aye, aye, sir. We'll beam you up in...
- Negative. We're staying here.

01:39.952 --> 01:41.576
The planet's atmosphere
will protect us.

01:41.745 --> 01:45.328
- Get that ship out of here, Mr. Scott.
- Very well, sir. Scott out.

01:45.499 --> 01:47.325
Mr. Spock, what about that tape?

01:47.500 --> 01:49.623
Remember, captain,
that what we see on this tape

01:49.794 --> 01:52.748
happened approximately
three months ago.

01:53.089 --> 01:57.300
I don't think I can stand another week
in this godforsaken place.

02:01.681 --> 02:04.598
In his hand
are the deep places of the earth.

02:04.767 --> 02:07.009
Psalm 95, verse 4.

02:07.936 --> 02:09.181
Looks like he was listening.

02:18.154 --> 02:20.361
Who's down there?!

02:22.367 --> 02:24.406
What happened to them?

02:28.790 --> 02:30.747
Where's that sound coming from?

02:30.917 --> 02:33.039
Spock, can you pinpoint it?

02:33.210 --> 02:36.164
Negative, captain. It doesn't register.

02:48.058 --> 02:49.766
Bones?

02:51.603 --> 02:53.429
Spock!

03:19.254 --> 03:22.705
Space, the final frontier.

03:27.929 --> 03:32.175
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:32.350 --> 03:36.299
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:36.478 --> 03:40.262
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:40.441 --> 03:44.355
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:31.155 --> 04:32.649
Spock.

04:33.032 --> 04:34.775
Bones.

04:36.660 --> 04:37.740
Where are we?

04:38.746 --> 04:43.787
Exactly 121.32 metres
beneath the planet's surface, captain.

04:43.959 --> 04:46.284
- How did we get here?
- Residual energy readings indicate

04:46.461 --> 04:48.833
we were beamed here
by a matter-energy scrambler

04:49.005 --> 04:51.294
similar to our own
transporter mechanism.

04:51.466 --> 04:53.791
- That's a nasty cut, Jim. Does it hurt?
- No.

04:53.968 --> 04:57.633
Captain, picking up a life-form reading,
bearing 42, mark 7.

04:57.805 --> 04:59.679
- One of the missing scientists?
- Negative.

04:59.849 --> 05:03.681
Although humanoid,
it is definitely not Homo sapiens.

05:03.853 --> 05:05.561
- Identification?
- Impossible.

05:05.730 --> 05:09.312
I can make no exact identification
other than it being humanoid.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.143
Let's find out.

05:11.318 --> 05:13.358
Phasers on stun.

05:24.414 --> 05:26.537
Approaching the life form, captain.

05:26.708 --> 05:30.123
- What is it?
- Still undistinguishable.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.100
Be careful.

05:47.686 --> 05:49.394
Well, she seems harmless enough.

05:49.563 --> 05:53.940
The sand bats of Manark IV appear
to be inanimate rock crystals, doctor,

05:54.109 --> 05:56.397
until they attack.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.579
We're not gonna hurt you.

06:14.586 --> 06:16.246
Is this your home?

06:17.214 --> 06:18.838
Do you live here?

06:21.718 --> 06:23.509
What about it, Spock? Analysis.

06:23.678 --> 06:25.801
From what we know
of the specific gravity

06:25.972 --> 06:28.545
and other environmental factors
of this planet,

06:28.725 --> 06:31.262
a life form such as hers
could not evolve here.

06:42.529 --> 06:44.273
Are you responsible
for bringing us here?

06:45.949 --> 06:47.491
Don't be afraid.

06:48.952 --> 06:51.075
Bones, what's wrong with her?

07:00.129 --> 07:03.878
She's a mute, Jim. No vocal chords.

07:04.050 --> 07:06.505
Not even vestigials.
And I don't think

07:06.677 --> 07:08.966
- it's a pathological condition.
- Explain.

07:09.138 --> 07:11.130
Well, she appears to be
perfectly healthy.

07:11.307 --> 07:13.714
For the other,
her lack of vocal chords

07:13.892 --> 07:17.937
could be physiologically normal
for her species, whatever that is.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.563
A race of mutes.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.767
Like the civilisation
on Gamma Vertis IV.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.730
That's my observation,
for whatever it's worth.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.813
Without speech,

07:27.989 --> 07:29.732
how's she gonna be able to
understand us?

07:29.907 --> 07:34.154
- Unless she's a telepath.
- An unlikely possibility, captain,

07:34.328 --> 07:37.495
since over 98 percent
of the known telepathic species

07:37.665 --> 07:39.704
send thoughts
as well as receive them.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.164
She's made no attempt
to contact our minds.

07:43.170 --> 07:45.542
Well, we can't keep
referring to her as "she,"

07:45.714 --> 07:47.837
as if she weren't here.

07:49.176 --> 07:51.085
Do you have any ideas?

07:51.761 --> 07:54.964
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna call her Gem.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.179
Gem, doctor?

07:57.350 --> 08:00.137
Well, that's better than "Hey, you."

08:01.062 --> 08:03.469
I wanna know why we're here.

08:04.357 --> 08:06.563
I wanna know what's going on.

08:08.986 --> 08:11.062
And she knows.

08:22.415 --> 08:23.530
- I'm Captain...
- We are aware

08:23.708 --> 08:25.368
of your identity, captain.

08:27.003 --> 08:28.628
Who are you?

08:29.005 --> 08:30.203
Why did you bring us here?

08:31.341 --> 08:34.294
We are Vians. Do not interfere.

08:38.806 --> 08:42.803
- What do you intend to do with us?
- Delay us no longer.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.352
We come in...

08:59.367 --> 09:02.119
Since you already know who we are,

09:02.286 --> 09:05.738
you must also know
that we come in peace.

09:06.749 --> 09:09.204
Our Prime Directive
specifically prohibits us

09:09.376 --> 09:10.574
from any interference...

09:37.278 --> 09:39.982
I can't seem to stand up.

09:40.156 --> 09:43.192
Don't fight the force field.

09:43.784 --> 09:48.244
There's something about it
that upsets the body metabolism.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.620
Not quite, doctor.

09:50.791 --> 09:54.622
The field draws its energy
from your bodies.

09:54.794 --> 09:59.041
The more you resist,
the stronger the force field becomes.

10:04.178 --> 10:06.218
Sufficient.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.977
Spock.

10:20.652 --> 10:23.819
There must be an exit
other than the one we just saw.

10:23.989 --> 10:26.065
Correct, captain.

10:28.451 --> 10:31.618
- Do you feel all right, Jim?
- Don't worry about me.

10:32.246 --> 10:34.369
They may have hurt her.

10:42.423 --> 10:44.166
Did they hurt you?

11:31.886 --> 11:34.044
The pain is gone.

11:34.847 --> 11:36.887
She touched my head
and the pain is gone.

11:38.059 --> 11:40.976
The wound is completely healed.

11:41.145 --> 11:42.722
It fits, Jim.

11:42.897 --> 11:44.177
She must be an empath.

11:49.820 --> 11:52.607
Her nervous system is so sensitive,
highly responsive,

11:52.781 --> 11:56.778
that she can actually feel our
emotional and physical reactions.

11:56.952 --> 11:59.525
- They become part of her.
- Thank you.

11:59.704 --> 12:01.032
Captain.

12:01.206 --> 12:03.198
In this direction,
my tricorder is now picking up

12:03.374 --> 12:05.414
a substantial collection of objects.

12:05.585 --> 12:08.076
- Details?
- Electronically sophisticated devices.

12:08.254 --> 12:10.081
I fail to understand why my tricorder

12:10.256 --> 12:12.414
previously gave no indication
of them being out there.

12:12.591 --> 12:15.545
Well, they're there now.
Let's go check them out.

12:16.595 --> 12:18.634
Staying here alone
could be dangerous.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.597
Come with us.

12:59.928 --> 13:01.671
Fascinating.

13:02.138 --> 13:04.380
Look at this stuff.

13:21.657 --> 13:23.151
Bones.

13:24.159 --> 13:25.902
Spock, come here.

13:48.223 --> 13:50.845
Jim, Spock.

14:10.369 --> 14:11.532
You're on schedule.

14:13.372 --> 14:16.041
Some further simple tests
are necessary.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.746
We've just seen the results
of some of your tests.

14:19.378 --> 14:21.785
I found our missing men. Dead.

14:21.964 --> 14:24.585
- Another one of your experiments?
- You're wrong.

14:24.758 --> 14:29.466
Their own imperfections killed them.
They were not fit subjects.

14:29.637 --> 14:31.132
Come.

14:31.473 --> 14:34.426
- Time is short.
- Yes. Your time is running out.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.632
This sun is about to nova.

14:35.810 --> 14:37.138
When it does, it'll destroy you,

14:37.311 --> 14:41.356
this planet
and this insane torture chamber.

14:45.653 --> 14:47.444
Let's get out of here.

14:48.405 --> 14:50.113
Readings indicate
the passage to the surface

14:50.282 --> 14:52.274
lies in this direction.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.193
Kirk to Enterprise.

15:31.362 --> 15:33.818
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.

15:34.365 --> 15:36.073
Out of range.

15:36.534 --> 15:37.530
Readings, Mr. Spock?

15:37.702 --> 15:40.275
Research station six kilometres
in that direction, captain.

15:40.454 --> 15:41.783
Let's get there as fast as we can.

15:41.956 --> 15:44.910
If the Enterprise has a search party,
it'll be there.

16:04.561 --> 16:06.185
Spock?

16:07.897 --> 16:09.890
Is it much further?

16:10.733 --> 16:12.441
Just ahead.

16:12.610 --> 16:16.442
Hey, Jim, look.
Scotty and the search party.

16:17.072 --> 16:18.235
- Scotty!
- Scotty!

16:18.407 --> 16:20.198
Stay there!

16:20.367 --> 16:22.656
- Come on.
- We're coming!

16:33.129 --> 16:34.754
Keep going.

16:47.935 --> 16:49.927
Their will to survive is great.

16:54.691 --> 16:58.392
- They love life greatly, to struggle so.
- The prime ingredient.

17:04.951 --> 17:06.492
Where did they go?

17:06.661 --> 17:09.412
I believe they were
never actually present, doctor.

17:09.579 --> 17:11.619
It was a mirage.

17:16.377 --> 17:18.252
Where's Kirk?

17:59.461 --> 18:00.706
Jim.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.670
What are you doing here?
Where's Scotty?

18:02.839 --> 18:05.626
- Captain, it was a mirage.
- Captain Kirk.

18:06.134 --> 18:10.048
We have decided that one specimen
will be sufficient.

18:10.221 --> 18:13.008
- You will come with us.
- What about the others?

18:13.182 --> 18:16.800
We have no interest in them.
They may go.

18:19.188 --> 18:21.145
- Very well.
- You can't go back there.

18:21.315 --> 18:22.857
You'll end up like the other two.

18:23.025 --> 18:25.860
- Captain, I request permission to be...
- Denied.

18:26.153 --> 18:27.528
But, captain...

18:31.658 --> 18:32.689
You have your orders.

18:44.211 --> 18:46.619
- What happened to my men?
- They are safe.

18:46.797 --> 18:49.039
One specimen.
You said one specimen.

18:49.216 --> 18:50.544
What happened to my men?

18:50.884 --> 18:54.300
- Indeed. The prime ingredient.
- Where are they? Tell me.

18:57.724 --> 18:59.515
You said you'd let them go.

19:02.937 --> 19:04.562
Mr. Sulu.

19:04.731 --> 19:07.138
Will you give us an estimate
into how much longer we'll have

19:07.317 --> 19:09.356
until those solar flares subside?

19:09.527 --> 19:11.069
Aye, sir.

19:12.572 --> 19:17.648
Readings now indicate
2.721 on the Ritter scale.

19:17.827 --> 19:19.819
At the present rate of decrease,

19:19.995 --> 19:21.739
we'll have to wait
at least 17 hours more

19:21.914 --> 19:26.706
- before we even attempt to enter orbit.
- Aye.

19:27.252 --> 19:31.499
Well, as long as we're
stuck out here,

19:31.673 --> 19:35.208
we might as well relax
until the storm passes.

19:35.635 --> 19:37.924
Storm's already lasted
four hours longer

19:38.096 --> 19:40.503
than we've anticipated.

19:41.599 --> 19:44.006
Do you suppose our landing party
could be in any danger?

19:44.185 --> 19:45.430
That's not likely.

19:45.603 --> 19:48.473
The planet's atmosphere
will give them ample protection.

19:48.647 --> 19:52.016
And if I know Captain Kirk,
he'll be more worried about us

19:52.192 --> 19:53.686
than we are about him.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.330
What is it you want to know?

20:06.498 --> 20:09.167
We seek no information
as you mean.

20:09.334 --> 20:13.283
Your civilisation is yet too immature
to have knowledge of value to us.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.704
You don't need any knowledge
from us,

20:15.881 --> 20:18.882
yet you're willing to kill for it.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.969
Is that what happened to
Linke and Ozaba?

20:22.137 --> 20:25.471
We did not kill them.
Their own fears killed them.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.641
Well, what did you expect
from them?

20:29.144 --> 20:30.603
And what do you want from me?

20:30.770 --> 20:34.104
We've already observed the intensity
of your passions

20:34.274 --> 20:37.725
and gauged your capacity
to love others.

20:37.902 --> 20:42.149
Now we want you to reveal to us
your courage and strength of will.

20:42.323 --> 20:44.066
Why?

20:45.034 --> 20:47.276
What is it you hope to prove?

20:48.329 --> 20:51.495
If my death is to have any meaning,

20:52.124 --> 20:54.496
at least tell me what I'm dying for.

20:54.668 --> 20:57.669
If you live,
you will have your answer.

21:29.534 --> 21:31.610
Come on, Spock,
the passageway was there before.

21:31.786 --> 21:34.028
It's gotta be there.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.661
Doctor, I'm unable to lock in
on the previous readings.

21:36.833 --> 21:39.834
I can find no exit out of here.

21:41.254 --> 21:42.962
Captain.

21:46.300 --> 21:49.087
Jim, what is it?
What have they done to you?

22:04.693 --> 22:07.528
Help him!
Don't be afraid to help him.

23:56.340 --> 23:57.964
Jim.

23:58.133 --> 24:01.466
You lie still.
I'll check her out right away.

24:12.605 --> 24:15.689
- Will she live?
- She seems fine now.

24:16.776 --> 24:19.101
Can you explain what happened?

24:19.278 --> 24:22.861
Complete empathy. She must be
a totally functional empath.

24:23.449 --> 24:25.525
Her nervous system
actually connected to yours

24:25.701 --> 24:27.859
to counteract the worst
of your symptoms.

24:28.036 --> 24:30.492
And with her strength,
she virtually sustained

24:30.664 --> 24:32.288
your body's physiological reactions.

24:32.457 --> 24:34.995
But she weakened. I could feel it.

24:35.168 --> 24:36.710
Is her life in danger?

24:36.878 --> 24:38.372
Well, it's impossible to say yet,

24:38.546 --> 24:42.045
but supplying your body
with life support did drain her.

24:42.216 --> 24:45.550
Her withdrawal seemed to suggest
the fear of death, doctor.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.637
Only your urging her on
caused her to continue.

24:48.806 --> 24:51.475
Well, that's true. Fear would
naturally be a first reaction.

24:51.642 --> 24:53.931
Perhaps she doesn't know
our captain well enough yet

24:54.103 --> 24:56.475
to offer up her life for him.

24:57.898 --> 24:59.522
Could the strain
really have killed her?

24:59.691 --> 25:02.894
Well, yes. However, I would assume
that her instinct for self-preservation

25:03.069 --> 25:06.485
would take over to prevent it.
How do you feel?

25:09.742 --> 25:12.150
I'm tired.

25:12.328 --> 25:14.997
Can you recall
what happened, captain?

25:15.498 --> 25:22.745
I remember the laboratory
and they wanted to know something.

25:25.299 --> 25:27.505
- I can't remember.
- Take it easy.

25:27.676 --> 25:29.882
- What's the matter with me?
- You have all the symptoms

25:30.053 --> 25:31.251
of the bends.

25:31.430 --> 25:35.048
Nitrogen bubbles in your blood
cause the pain.

25:35.559 --> 25:37.765
Now, how would one
get the bends down here?

25:37.936 --> 25:39.928
You'll have to ask the Vians.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.555
Will I live?

25:43.733 --> 25:46.140
Well, you could use some time
in our decompression chamber,

25:46.319 --> 25:49.901
but otherwise, I'd say your recovery's
just about miraculous.

25:50.072 --> 25:53.690
I wish I could take the credit for it,
but she did the work.

25:54.118 --> 25:57.237
Captain, I noted
that a light preceded you

25:57.413 --> 26:00.034
at the moment you were returned
here from the Vians' laboratory.

26:00.207 --> 26:02.116
Spock, why do you have to get
so analytical at..?

26:02.292 --> 26:03.667
No, he's right. Continue.

26:03.835 --> 26:06.789
I conclude that such a light
is an energy-transfer point

26:06.963 --> 26:09.715
linking this device
to the power source.

26:09.883 --> 26:11.293
Can you tap into it?

26:11.467 --> 26:14.172
If I can determine the frequency
at which this device operates,

26:14.345 --> 26:16.219
I might be able
to cause it to function for us.

26:16.389 --> 26:19.425
And get us out of here
the same way they brought us in.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.850
- I would say so.
- And I would say proceed.

26:25.898 --> 26:28.649
You are called "captain."

26:29.067 --> 26:31.024
You are responsible for
the lives of your crew.

26:31.194 --> 26:33.270
- Is this correct?
- It is.

26:33.447 --> 26:34.645
We find it necessary

26:34.823 --> 26:38.441
to have the cooperation
of one of your men in our efforts.

26:38.618 --> 26:43.280
- We will not cooperate.
- When we resume our interrogations,

26:43.456 --> 26:45.994
you will decide
which of your men we shall use.

26:47.168 --> 26:48.579
It is essential.

26:48.753 --> 26:51.919
There is an 87 percent chance
that the doctor will die.

26:52.882 --> 26:56.500
And while Commander Spock's life
is not in danger,

26:56.677 --> 26:59.250
the possibility is 93 percent

26:59.429 --> 27:04.340
that he will suffer brain damage
resulting in permanent insanity.

27:18.364 --> 27:21.697
- How's it coming, Spock?
- I do not know, captain.

27:21.867 --> 27:25.366
I begin to understand
its operating principles, but that is all.

27:25.537 --> 27:27.993
Spock, it won't be too long
before the Vians come back.

27:28.165 --> 27:30.122
You'd better find out
how that thing works soon.

27:30.292 --> 27:31.869
Take it easy, Bones.

27:32.044 --> 27:34.202
Men weren't intended
to live this far underground.

27:34.379 --> 27:37.713
- It's just not natural.
- And space travel is?

27:37.882 --> 27:39.674
Some men spend the majority
of their lives

27:39.843 --> 27:41.669
in mines beneath the surface.

27:41.845 --> 27:44.798
I'm a doctor, not a coal miner.

27:45.515 --> 27:48.718
I've recorded my principles
and theories on the tricorder, doctor.

27:48.893 --> 27:50.885
Should the Vians return,
there is sufficient data

27:51.062 --> 27:54.181
for you and the captain
to complete the adjustments.

27:54.356 --> 27:56.064
I'm not a mechanic.

27:56.233 --> 27:59.020
I couldn't get that thing to work,
no matter many notes you left.

27:59.194 --> 28:01.732
Possibly not, but you
and the captain together

28:01.905 --> 28:03.732
will be able to do so.

28:03.907 --> 28:05.449
In any case, Spock,

28:05.617 --> 28:07.740
you are the logical one
to leave with the captain.

28:07.911 --> 28:09.903
The decision's mine.

28:11.915 --> 28:16.292
If there are any decisions
to be made, I'll make them.

28:17.879 --> 28:20.583
If and when it becomes necessary.

28:36.646 --> 28:39.433
- What is it? I don't need any...
- I'm still chief medical officer.

28:39.607 --> 28:42.608
I'll tell you what you need
and when you need it.

28:42.777 --> 28:44.770
Would you rather have the bends?

28:44.946 --> 28:48.445
That's it. Just lie down and relax.

28:48.741 --> 28:51.314
How long will he be asleep, doctor?

28:52.870 --> 28:56.037
Between the emotional strain
and that attack of bends,

28:56.206 --> 28:57.535
he's in pretty bad shape.

28:57.708 --> 29:01.242
I'm not criticising your action, doctor.
On the contrary.

29:01.420 --> 29:04.456
I'm quite grateful for it.
The captain will be spared the strain

29:04.631 --> 29:07.300
of making so difficult a decision.

29:07.467 --> 29:10.338
You simplified
the situation considerably.

29:10.512 --> 29:11.626
How?

29:11.805 --> 29:14.805
While the captain is asleep,
I am in command.

29:14.974 --> 29:18.224
When the Vians return,
I shall go with them.

29:19.103 --> 29:21.559
- If I hadn't given him that shot..?
- Precisely.

29:21.731 --> 29:23.807
The choice would have been
the captain's.

29:23.983 --> 29:26.308
Now it is mine.

30:27.459 --> 30:33.379
Your action is highly unethical.
My decision stands.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.261
Not this time, Spock.

30:44.058 --> 30:45.885
The choice has been made.

30:47.854 --> 30:50.226
You stay here with my friends.
They'll take care of you.

30:53.984 --> 30:55.360
Do you understand?

31:00.074 --> 31:01.354
Come, then.

31:26.515 --> 31:28.840
Doctor, please understand

31:29.018 --> 31:31.769
that if there was any other way
to accomplish our purpose...

31:38.151 --> 31:39.610
Get on with it.

31:53.082 --> 31:54.576
Why did you let him do it?

31:54.750 --> 31:57.455
I was convinced
in the same way you were, captain.

31:57.628 --> 32:01.163
- By the good doctor's hypo.
- Anything?

32:02.382 --> 32:04.375
A most unusual device.

32:04.551 --> 32:08.134
It is a control unit,
but not a control mechanism.

32:08.305 --> 32:11.471
- In fact, it is not a mechanical device.
- What exactly is it?

32:11.641 --> 32:15.342
This control is attuned to only one
electrical pattern of energy:

32:15.520 --> 32:17.512
The pattern produced
by the mental impulses

32:17.689 --> 32:19.231
of the person who possesses it.

32:19.482 --> 32:22.851
It is activated solely
by mental commands.

32:23.027 --> 32:27.155
Can you adapt it, re-attune it,
to fit our brain patterns?

32:27.573 --> 32:29.316
I shall attempt to do so.

32:29.491 --> 32:32.492
However, it is not possible
to adjust the control

32:32.661 --> 32:34.867
to fit more than one pattern
at a time.

32:35.038 --> 32:37.529
I am, of course,
most familiar with my own pattern.

32:37.708 --> 32:39.202
Therefore, with your permission, l...

32:39.376 --> 32:41.582
Do whatever you have to do
to make it work, Spock.

32:41.753 --> 32:46.165
What disturbs me is why
the Vians let us keep it.

32:46.341 --> 32:47.455
Fascinating.

32:47.634 --> 32:49.176
They must have known
we were capable

32:49.344 --> 32:52.178
of comprehending this control
and making use of it.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.138
And that we would use it to escape.

32:54.307 --> 32:58.138
The only logical assumption
is that they wish to let us go.

32:58.519 --> 33:00.511
And they keep McCoy.

33:00.688 --> 33:03.854
That is evidently
their intention, captain.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.188
Somehow,

33:10.947 --> 33:14.648
you're the crux,
the focal point of all this.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.692
Even before we got here,
she was a prisoner.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.910
They didn't hurt her,
they didn't even threaten her.

33:20.081 --> 33:23.781
Indeed. The facts would indicate
that she is essential to their purpose.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.201
Yes, there is a purpose,

33:26.379 --> 33:28.704
but what is it?

33:32.843 --> 33:36.710
Has all the pain
and terror happened,

33:36.888 --> 33:39.260
or been made to happen,

33:39.933 --> 33:41.724
for you?

33:42.727 --> 33:44.803
Completed, captain.

33:45.230 --> 33:46.854
The adjustments are delicate.

33:47.023 --> 33:48.814
They may not survive
more than even one use.

33:48.983 --> 33:51.901
However, there should be
sufficient energy

33:52.069 --> 33:54.027
to transfer us to the Enterprise.

33:55.656 --> 33:59.357
- Will it take us to McCoy?
- If you so desire.

34:06.124 --> 34:08.413
The best defence
is a strong offence,

34:08.585 --> 34:10.708
and I intend to start offending
right now.

34:15.925 --> 34:17.752
Aim for the lab.

34:24.058 --> 34:25.849
Bones.

34:38.947 --> 34:40.690
Spock.

34:41.491 --> 34:43.234
Get him down.

34:44.953 --> 34:46.362
His wrists.

35:02.720 --> 35:03.964
His pulse is almost gone.

35:07.557 --> 35:10.309
- How is he?
- Severe heart damage.

35:10.477 --> 35:13.050
Signs of congestion in both lungs.

35:13.229 --> 35:16.396
Evidence of massive
circulatory collapse.

35:18.651 --> 35:20.276
Don't talk.

35:21.154 --> 35:22.814
Don't speak.

35:23.990 --> 35:26.777
Take it easy until
we get you back to the ship.

35:37.836 --> 35:41.169
- What is it? What's the matter?
- He's dying, Jim.

35:41.339 --> 35:43.415
We can make him comfortable,
but that is all.

35:43.592 --> 35:45.383
You don't know. You're not a doctor.

35:45.552 --> 35:49.086
I am. Go on.

35:55.144 --> 35:57.302
Internal injuries.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.231
Bleeding in the chest and abdomen.

36:00.524 --> 36:02.896
Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver.

36:03.569 --> 36:08.065
- Seventy percent kidney failure.
- He's right, Jim.

36:09.282 --> 36:12.449
Being a doctor has its drawbacks.

36:13.662 --> 36:16.532
I always wondered why l...

36:23.254 --> 36:24.878
Thanks.

36:28.134 --> 36:29.711
How long?

36:29.885 --> 36:32.293
It could happen any time.

36:33.472 --> 36:37.137
The correct medical phrase,
eh, Spock?

36:49.028 --> 36:53.655
You've got a good
bedside manner, Spock.

37:06.462 --> 37:08.419
Can't we do something?

37:10.007 --> 37:11.086
I'm afraid not.

37:24.729 --> 37:27.433
Gem might be able to help him
the way she helped me.

37:27.606 --> 37:31.355
But could his nearness to death
also kill her?

37:31.527 --> 37:35.109
Uncertain, captain.
Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction

37:35.280 --> 37:38.447
assumes that her instinct
for self-preservation would prevent it.

37:38.617 --> 37:42.864
- However, we cannot be positive.
- If she could just strengthen him

37:43.038 --> 37:47.498
and keep him from sinking further into
death, we might be able to save him.

37:51.754 --> 37:54.625
No interference will be permitted.

37:57.551 --> 38:00.007
She can save his life.

38:00.513 --> 38:01.971
Let us help her to go to him.

38:02.139 --> 38:04.844
She must not be urged or forced
to take action.

38:05.017 --> 38:09.643
- All must proceed without interference.
- The purpose that brought us together...

38:09.813 --> 38:11.141
What purpose can all this serve,

38:11.314 --> 38:13.805
except the fulfilment
of some need of yours?

38:13.984 --> 38:16.521
We have but one need left in life,

38:16.695 --> 38:19.980
and that is to see the completion
of the final moment of our test.

38:20.156 --> 38:23.240
- Be patient.
- Patient? Our friend is dying.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.108
Perhaps.

38:25.286 --> 38:27.362
What purpose can be served
by the death of our friend,

38:27.538 --> 38:29.163
except to bring you pleasure?

38:29.331 --> 38:31.324
Surely, beings as advanced
as yourselves know

38:31.500 --> 38:33.742
that your star system
will soon be extinct.

38:33.919 --> 38:36.624
- Your sun will nova.
- We know.

38:36.797 --> 38:38.789
Then you also know
that the millions of inhabitants

38:38.966 --> 38:40.294
on its planets are doomed.

38:40.842 --> 38:42.467
That is why we are here.

38:43.220 --> 38:47.217
This arena of death that
you've devised for your pleasure,

38:47.390 --> 38:51.554
- will it prevent this catastrophe?
- No, it will not.

38:51.728 --> 38:54.349
But it may save Gem's planet.

38:54.522 --> 38:56.479
Of all the planets of Minara,

38:56.649 --> 39:00.481
we have the power to transport
the inhabitants of only one to safety.

39:00.653 --> 39:04.567
If Gem's planet
is the one that will be saved,

39:04.740 --> 39:07.990
we must make certain,
beyond any doubt whatsoever,

39:08.160 --> 39:09.868
they are worthy of survival.

39:10.871 --> 39:14.204
How will the death of our friend
serve this purpose?

39:15.375 --> 39:17.747
His death will not serve it.

39:17.919 --> 39:20.790
But her willingness
to give her life for him will.

39:22.382 --> 39:24.707
- You were her teachers.
- We were?

39:27.053 --> 39:31.382
- What could she learn from us?
- Your will to survive.

39:31.557 --> 39:36.135
Your love of life.
Your passion to know.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.513
They are recorded in her being.

39:39.064 --> 39:41.021
Her planet will be fortunate.

39:43.026 --> 39:46.810
Each of you was willing
to give his life for the others.

39:46.988 --> 39:48.732
We must now find out
whether that instinct

39:48.907 --> 39:51.658
has been transmitted to Gem.

39:55.163 --> 39:58.448
- Time grows short.
- You were correct, captain.

39:58.624 --> 40:02.408
Everything that has occurred here
has been caused to happen by them.

40:02.586 --> 40:04.662
This has all been a great laboratory,

40:04.838 --> 40:07.376
and we have been
the subjects of the test.

40:07.549 --> 40:11.499
No. We only created
the circumstances.

40:12.554 --> 40:14.048
That was necessary.

40:14.222 --> 40:17.306
Your actions were spontaneous.

40:17.475 --> 40:20.595
Everything that is truest
and best in all species of beings

40:20.770 --> 40:22.229
has been revealed by you.

40:23.356 --> 40:27.934
Those are the qualities that
make a civilisation worthy to survive.

40:29.904 --> 40:31.066
Behold.

40:58.973 --> 41:01.974
That is most significant.

41:02.143 --> 41:05.974
An instinct new to the essence
of her being is generating.

41:06.146 --> 41:08.602
Compassion for another

41:08.774 --> 41:13.103
is becoming part of
her functioning life system.

43:09.596 --> 43:10.759
She is afraid.

43:15.102 --> 43:17.806
She's saving herself.

43:18.772 --> 43:21.607
She does not yet have the instinct
to save her people.

43:29.157 --> 43:31.030
We have failed?

43:31.534 --> 43:32.944
No.

43:33.619 --> 43:34.947
No, not yet.

43:38.999 --> 43:43.495
Captain, Dr. McCoy's life
is not solely dependant on Gem.

43:43.670 --> 43:46.790
The Vians, too, must be
capable of saving his life.

43:47.466 --> 43:49.707
- True.
- Then you cannot let him die.

43:49.884 --> 43:51.295
His death is not important.

43:52.762 --> 43:56.297
We must wait to see whether
her instinct for self-sacrifice

43:56.474 --> 43:59.428
has become stronger than
her instinct for self-preservation.

44:29.422 --> 44:33.170
Don't touch me. Stay away.

44:35.469 --> 44:37.011
Jim.

44:37.429 --> 44:39.054
Spock.

44:39.598 --> 44:41.970
- Are you here?
- Yes, Bones.

44:42.142 --> 44:44.016
Don't let her touch me. She'll die.

44:47.022 --> 44:48.599
Jim.

44:49.482 --> 44:52.187
I can't destroy life,

44:53.027 --> 44:54.771
even if it's to save my own.

44:55.488 --> 44:57.813
I can't. Now, you know that.

44:58.157 --> 45:00.695
I can't let you do it.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.534
Captain?

45:07.708 --> 45:10.199
- What is it?
- The intensity of emotion

45:10.377 --> 45:13.960
is draining us
and building up the force field.

45:14.131 --> 45:17.167
- Yes, I know.
- It draws its energy from us, captain.

45:17.342 --> 45:21.968
In spite of what we see,
all emotion must be suppressed.

45:22.138 --> 45:24.808
That might weaken the field.

45:25.558 --> 45:27.218
I'll try.

45:37.236 --> 45:38.351
Yes.

45:53.835 --> 45:55.412
Spock.

45:59.465 --> 46:02.217
You cannot use our powers
to change what is happening.

46:04.095 --> 46:08.756
- You must save the life of our friend.
- No. We will not.

46:11.435 --> 46:14.519
Her instinct must be
developed to the fullest.

46:14.688 --> 46:16.562
The test must be complete.

46:16.732 --> 46:17.811
It is complete.

46:17.983 --> 46:22.395
Gem has earned the right of survival
for her planet. She offered her life.

46:22.570 --> 46:28.110
- To offer is not proof enough.
- If death is all you understand,

46:29.243 --> 46:30.951
here are four lives for you.

46:35.750 --> 46:38.371
We will not leave our friend.

46:38.544 --> 46:41.249
You've lost the capacity
to feel the emotions

46:41.422 --> 46:43.628
you brought Gem here
to experience.

46:43.799 --> 46:47.796
You don't understand
what it is to live.

46:49.971 --> 46:54.135
Love and compassion are dead in you.
You're nothing but intellect.

47:51.947 --> 47:53.026
Farewell.

48:14.551 --> 48:16.045
Strange.

48:16.220 --> 48:20.169
- What is puzzling you, captain?
- I'm not puzzled, Mr. Spock, I'm...

48:20.807 --> 48:22.385
...awed.

48:22.892 --> 48:25.348
I'm with you, captain. She awed me.

48:25.520 --> 48:28.189
No, no. I wasn't thinking of Gem,

48:28.356 --> 48:31.143
I was thinking of that
fantastic element of chance

48:31.317 --> 48:35.778
that out in limitless space,
we should come together with Gem.

48:36.072 --> 48:39.238
Captain, the element of chance
can virtually be eliminated

48:39.408 --> 48:41.981
by a civilisation as advanced
as the Vians.

48:42.161 --> 48:44.200
Not to dispute your computer,
Mr. Spock,

48:44.371 --> 48:48.997
but from what little you've told me,
I'd say she was a pearl of great price.

48:49.793 --> 48:51.168
What, Scott?

48:51.920 --> 48:54.411
Do you not know
the story of the merchant?

48:58.301 --> 48:59.332
The merchant.

48:59.510 --> 49:02.084
Who, when he found
one pearl of great price,

49:02.263 --> 49:05.050
went and sold all that he had
and bought it.

49:05.224 --> 49:07.098
Yes, she was all that.

49:07.268 --> 49:09.391
But whether the Vians
bought her or found her

49:09.562 --> 49:12.432
makes little difference.
She was of great value.

49:12.606 --> 49:17.315
Well, personally, I find it fascinating
that with all their scientific knowledge

49:17.486 --> 49:19.110
and advances,

49:19.279 --> 49:21.402
that it was good old-fashioned
human emotion

49:21.573 --> 49:22.948
that they valued the most.

49:23.116 --> 49:25.441
Perhaps the Vulcans
should hear about this.

49:26.870 --> 49:30.784
Mr. Spock, can you be prevailed upon
to bring them the news?

49:30.957 --> 49:32.368
Possibly, captain.

49:32.542 --> 49:36.954
I shall certainly give the thought
all the consideration it is due.

49:41.467 --> 49:46.805
- Mr. Sulu. Ahead, warp factor 2.
- Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor 2.
