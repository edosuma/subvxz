01:06.040 --> 01:07.963
Please! Please!

01:15.520 --> 01:18.091
I'm sorry, I don't speak Albanian!

01:20.120 --> 01:21.770
Stop! I don't understand!

01:30.840 --> 01:32.205
Do you understand now?

01:33.680 --> 01:36.763
That's a Jericho 941 pointed at my head.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.250
You can get one
on the black market for $300.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.441
Yeah.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.041
It is a very reliable weapon.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.002
My name is David Packouz.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.407
And I'm an international arms dealer.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.727
What do you know about war?

01:57.960 --> 02:01.362
They'll tell you it's about
patriotism, democracy

02:01.600 --> 02:04.080
or some shit about the other guy
hating our freedom.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.287
But you want to know
what it's really about?

02:07.880 --> 02:09.530
What do you see?

02:09.720 --> 02:13.446
A kid from Arkansas doing his
patriotic duty to defend his country?

02:14.120 --> 02:16.248
I see a helmet, fire-retardant gloves,

02:16.440 --> 02:18.408
body armor, and an M16.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.651
I see $17,500.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.971
That's what it costs to outfit
one American soldier.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.201
Over two million soldiers

02:28.400 --> 02:30.289
fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.400
It cost the American taxpayer
$4.5 billion each year

02:36.600 --> 02:38.284
just to pay the air conditioning bills

02:38.480 --> 02:40.130
for those wars.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.248
And that's what war is really about.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.002
War is an economy.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.371
Anybody who tells you otherwise

02:50.600 --> 02:52.967
is either in on it or stupid.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.484
But I didn't know that yet.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.726
Back then, I didn't know anything.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.930
You can't park here.

03:33.160 --> 03:37.006
Hey, man. I just got
a client at 2150, Mr. Shore.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.846
I'm a few minutes early.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.168
Yeah? It's a gated community.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.526
You still can't park here.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.402
You probably shouldn't
smoke that here, either.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.201
Okay. Thanks.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.480
There's a lot I could say
about this period in my life

04:11.680 --> 04:13.842
that would give context to this story.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.401
I could tell you how

04:19.600 --> 04:21.442
I dropped out of college
after one semester.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.930
- How's that left quad doing?
- It's still sore.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.481
Had a falling out with my parents.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.729
How I either quit or got fired
from six different jobs.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.527
- That's it.
- All right. There we go.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.326
But looking back I think the most
important thing to understand is

04:42.080 --> 04:44.401
I was completely lost.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.891
Sorry. It fell.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.884
That's okay, Gary.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.450
I was 22 years old

05:08.640 --> 05:12.725
massaging rich dudes in Miami Beach
for 75 bucks an hour.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.324
But I'd had enough.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.807
It was time to change shit up.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.362
And I had a big idea.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.405
My plan was to sell
quality bed sheets wholesale

05:43.600 --> 05:45.523
to all the retirement homes
in South Florida.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.370
And there were hundreds of them.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.609
- It feels really soft.
- It should.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.087
It's Egyptian cotton, 400 thread count.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.011
I mean, it's pretty much top of the line
for institutional use.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.722
I don't know. It seems excessive.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.407
Well, at $29 per unit,
it's far from excessive.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.571
David, do you know the average age
of a resident here at Hilldale?

06:10.920 --> 06:12.046
Um, no, I don't.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.447
- Eighty-two years old.
- Wow.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.846
Have you ever seen the skin
on an 82-year-old man?

06:18.040 --> 06:20.168
Have you ever felt it?

06:20.400 --> 06:22.289
Yeah. Actually,
I'm a certified massage therapist

06:22.520 --> 06:24.124
and a lot of my clients are elderly.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.407
Then you should know.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.410
These sheets,

06:27.600 --> 06:31.082
it would be like wrapping
a lizard in cashmere.

06:31.640 --> 06:32.971
Would you do that?

06:33.200 --> 06:36.170
Would you wrap a lizard in cashmere?

06:37.520 --> 06:39.568
I guess not.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.127
Then why would you expect me to?

06:45.120 --> 06:47.248
My nephew.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.285
He's good, right?

06:51.520 --> 06:56.208
I'd sunk my entire life savings
into 65 cases of premium bed sheets

06:56.400 --> 06:58.880
but I overlooked one crucial factor.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.646
No one really cares about old people.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.481
Why don't you just sell them back?

07:07.680 --> 07:10.251
It doesn't work like that.
I bought them in bulk.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.525
I'm so fucked.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.165
You're not fucked.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.010
Pete's fucked.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.489
He's dead.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.967
Holy shit. Is that Efraim?

07:27.200 --> 07:28.440
Yeah.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.048
I thought he was still in LA.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.926
Me too.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.730
- He was a great friend.
- Thank you.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.205
He looks so tan.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.602
Efraim Diveroli
was my best friend growing up.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.808
But I hadn't seen him since he was shipped
off to live with his uncle in 10th grade.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.162
I think our parents wanted to keep us
as far apart as possible.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.367
There is no table of contents
in the Book of Life.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.767
We don't know if we're at the beginning
of a new chapter, or the end of a story.

08:02.720 --> 08:06.847
Which is why we must be grateful
every time the page turns.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.250
Did you come back just for this?

08:09.440 --> 08:11.761
Fuck no! I barely knew Pete.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.849
I was hoping to see you here.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.008
You know your mom
wouldn't give me your number?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.247
What, did you call my house?

08:17.440 --> 08:19.727
No, I was fucking her.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.844
She still hates me, huh?

08:23.040 --> 08:24.485
Yeah, most likely.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.205
I missed you, bro.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.521
Yeah, me too.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.650
Let's go for a ride.

08:29.880 --> 08:30.927
Uh...

08:31.120 --> 08:33.009
I can't. I got a client at 4:00.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.890
Fuck that shit. Cancel it.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.650
Your boy's back in town.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.171
Come on!

08:47.720 --> 08:48.926
So, what happened with LA, man?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.121
Why did you move back?

08:50.280 --> 08:52.203
Oh, you know I was working
for my uncle, right?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.971
Yeah, I heard that you were, like,
a gun dealer or something.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.121
Pretty much. I mean,

08:56.360 --> 08:59.648
we'd buy seized weapons at police auctions
and resell them on the Internet.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.841
Cool.

09:01.080 --> 09:04.801
It was cool until my uncle
scumbagged me over 70 grand.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.764
Holy shit. Seventy grand?

09:06.960 --> 09:09.804
Whatever. Fuck him.
I made a bunch of money.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.890
I decided I'd come back to Miami,
start up my own shop.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.320
Cool.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.811
Yo, where's this guy live?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.162
It's, like, five more minutes.
You got somewhere you gotta be?

09:19.840 --> 09:20.887
No.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.407
All right. So, I can't figure out
which is worse.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.807
The fact that you sell
bed sheets to old age homes

09:26.040 --> 09:27.644
or that you jerk guys off for money.

09:27.840 --> 09:31.322
For the record,
I'm a licensed massage therapist, okay?

09:31.520 --> 09:32.851
Totally legit.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.249
Okay. But at the end,
the guys have to come, right?

09:36.440 --> 09:37.885
Like, on your chest or whatever?

09:38.080 --> 09:40.082
You know what? Fuck you.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.089
Fuck you, buddy.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.045
Bro, do you remember the last time
we went to buy weed together?

09:45.240 --> 09:47.288
Of course I do. It was fucking traumatic.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.046
Yeah, but do you remember the next day,
when we walked into school

09:50.240 --> 09:52.208
and everybody knew that we got arrested?

09:52.480 --> 09:54.323
Yeah, we were gangsters, bro.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.841
We thought we ran South Beach.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.849
We did run yeshiva.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.849
We didn't take shit from anyone.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.646
Yeah, I miss that.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.127
You miss yeshiva?

10:05.320 --> 10:07.129
No, I miss

10:07.520 --> 10:09.522
not taking shit from anyone.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.401
Yo!

10:24.240 --> 10:26.686
He out. You looking for weed?

10:27.120 --> 10:29.202
Depends. You got good shit?

10:29.440 --> 10:32.364
Put it this way. I sell him his shit.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.644
What's up with this nigga, man?

10:36.840 --> 10:38.285
Cool. Can you do an ounce?

10:38.480 --> 10:40.767
Yeah, no sweat. Three bills.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.211
Three hundred. I like it.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.721
You get the better price
when you come direct to the distributor.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.365
I guess so.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.686
All right.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.401
Yeah, so, she opened the door.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.289
And I'm like, "Yo. Chill.
I ain't about that drama."

10:54.520 --> 10:55.521
You know what I mean?

10:55.720 --> 10:56.881
"I know you got
another nigga in the crib."

10:57.080 --> 10:58.206
What's up?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.201
What?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.285
Can I get the shit?

11:03.480 --> 11:04.811
What shit?

11:08.280 --> 11:10.601
I just gave you $300 for some weed.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.205
Any of you niggas ever
seen this motherfucker before?

11:14.440 --> 11:15.566
I ain't seen shit.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.202
Man, get the fuck out of here.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.166
- All right. All right, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.241
This white boy wild.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.726
Parachute pants.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.485
Looking like Jay Leno and shit.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.405
Look like he going to church.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.051
Yo, yo, hold up, hold up, man.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.526
- What the fuck.
- Shit!

11:53.400 --> 11:55.880
Come on! Where's everybody going?

11:56.080 --> 11:57.923
I thought we were gonna hang out.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.525
What a bunch of assholes.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.490
What the fuck was that? Are you crazy?

12:05.640 --> 12:06.641
It's cool, bro.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.451
I have a Class 3 Firearms license.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.530
- Huh?
- Come on, get in.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.370
I know another dealer nearby.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.286
It's weird. We were the same age,
but I always looked up to Efraim.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.726
When life kicked me, I stayed down.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.083
But not Efraim. He kicked back.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.123
Mr. President, we want to thank you

12:29.320 --> 12:30.731
for visiting us here today.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.207
We are honored to be serving our country,

12:33.440 --> 12:35.044
and proud to welcome you,

12:35.240 --> 12:37.447
our wartime Commander in Chief...

12:38.600 --> 12:40.762
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.610
How was the funeral?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.643
It was amazing.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.690
Oh, my God. You're so stoned, aren't you?

12:51.880 --> 12:53.450
Huh? What?

12:53.640 --> 12:56.246
You just described a funeral as "amazing."

12:56.440 --> 12:58.727
What? No. The funeral was really sad.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.883
Yeah, everyone was totally bummed out.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.401
But I ran into my friend from growing up.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.841
The guy I told you about. Efraim Diveroli?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.649
The one you got arrested with?

13:08.960 --> 13:12.328
Yeah. I mean, we did
some other stuff too, but...

13:12.560 --> 13:14.722
Anyway, he just moved back to Miami.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.285
That's great, right?

13:16.520 --> 13:19.000
Yeah. I'm supposed
to swing by his office tomorrow.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.770
We're gonna grab lunch.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.324
- Okay.
- Are you hungry?

13:23.520 --> 13:24.760
- Hmm?
- I'm so hungry.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.641
- We don't have much here.
- Oh.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.002
- I mean, we have pizza.
- Really?

13:31.240 --> 13:32.924
- And nachos.
- We have nachos?

13:33.160 --> 13:34.730
And ice cream.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.207
Wait, what? We never have ice cream.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.049
You're fucking with me, aren't you?

13:41.360 --> 13:43.931
That is so mean.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.250
That was so easy.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.121
Hello?

13:54.320 --> 13:56.971
Hello, Mr. Borstein.
This is David Packouz.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.685
You told me to call today at 11:00.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.521
I have those bed sheets with me,
and I would love for you to take a look.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.285
Uh, sir, if you give me the chance

14:07.480 --> 14:09.369
I am confident that your residents

14:09.560 --> 14:10.971
will appreciate the difference.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.921
It's an expense we can't justify,
and we're just not interested.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.366
Uh-huh.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.762
Okay, well, thank you for your time.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.081
Yeah, this is contract specialist

14:33.280 --> 14:35.806
Lindsey Michaels
from Army Command, Picatinny.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.571
That's right.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.890
Yeah, I sent out a solicitation
for some 249s for Basra

14:46.080 --> 14:48.447
and we seem to have
misplaced your paperwork.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.642
Great. So if you can go ahead
and just re-email me those numbers.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.047
Actually, you know what?
On second thought,

14:56.240 --> 14:57.890
we're about to make
a decision on those RFPs.

14:58.120 --> 15:02.367
Why don't you go ahead and just give me
your bid while I got you here on the phone?

15:03.400 --> 15:04.447
Uh-huh.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.245
And does that include mags?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.088
Great. Yes, sir.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.200
You keep supplying the guns,
we'll keep killing the bad guys.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.285
God bless you.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.970
What a fucking tool. What's up, bro?

15:16.160 --> 15:18.367
Yo, what's up, man?
What was that all about?

15:18.600 --> 15:20.682
Oh, that was me
impersonating an army officer.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.689
Really? What for?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.042
To find out what my competitor's
bidding on a contract.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.050
It's fucking genius.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.688
I thought that you said you sold, like,
seized weapons to gun nuts on the Internet.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.006
Not anymore.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.969
Now I only sell to one gun nut.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.531
Oh, yeah? Which one?

15:36.640 --> 15:38.483
The U.S. Military, motherfucker.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.010
Wanna do a bong hit?

15:57.320 --> 15:58.606
Pretty sick, huh?

15:58.800 --> 16:01.201
So what, you sell these things
to the Pentagon?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.767
I sell all kinds of shit to the Pentagon.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.725
Guns, bullets, body armor.

16:06.920 --> 16:11.369
Last week, I shipped 400 gas masks
to American Special Forces in Iraq.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.881
No shit.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.523
How long you been doing this for?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.245
Two, three months.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.408
And you make good money?

16:20.840 --> 16:22.729
Oh! Fuck, man.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.725
Put it this way.
I did over 200K in the past eight weeks.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.162
And I'm only telling you that
because you're my boy.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.486
I'm not bragging.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.085
Holy shit.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.725
Yeah. Check this out.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.450
Fed Biz Opps stands for
Federal Business Opportunities.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.768
Think eBay, but for war.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.921
- They buy tanks on here?
- Bro, they buy everything on here.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.521
It was crazy.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.802
The government had a public website

16:49.000 --> 16:52.447
containing every military contract
currently up for bidding.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.126
But I skip the big ticket items,
and look for the small-ball shit

16:55.360 --> 16:57.601
that giant defense contractors ignore.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.121
Everybody's fighting over the same pie.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.845
But they're ignoring the crumbs.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.481
I live on crumbs, like a rat.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.328
And when you're dealing with the Pentagon,
crumbs are worth millions.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.320
These listings seemed to go on forever.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.246
And according to Efraim, they did.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.402
Thanks, man.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.241
So, I don't get it.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.089
If there's an entire defense industry,

17:22.280 --> 17:25.124
why would the Pentagon
want to buy anything from you?

17:25.280 --> 17:27.931
They don't want to, they have to.

17:28.119 --> 17:29.531
Remember Little League?

17:29.760 --> 17:32.604
How, at the end of the season,
they'd give out that big MVP trophy

17:32.800 --> 17:34.165
and that one kid would always win it?

17:34.440 --> 17:35.646
Yeah, Evan Talbot.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.286
Right. But then, one year,
somebody's mom complained?

17:38.480 --> 17:41.802
Then they had to give everybody
a little trophy so they wouldn't feel bad?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.804
Even that fat retarded kid,
Robbie Friedman, got one.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.002
That's kind of like what's happening here.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.284
I'm still confused, man.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.643
The Pentagon fucked up
when they were rebuilding the Iraqi Army.

17:52.880 --> 17:57.010
They gave all these no-bid contracts
to Cheney's boys, and they got caught.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.686
So Bush started this initiative
to level the playing field

17:59.840 --> 18:03.322
and now every Pentagon purchase,
every gun, every grenade,

18:03.560 --> 18:07.246
every bullet, gets offered to
small businesses for bidding.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.330
And sure, the big dogs
still get the big trophies.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.847
But the Pentagon's
got to give little trophies

18:13.000 --> 18:15.480
to all the Robbie Friedmans of the world.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.728
So, basically, you're a fat retarded kid.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.566
Bro, I'm the fattest and most retarded.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.568
In a speech today, President Bush
said that contrary to reports

18:27.760 --> 18:30.684
he has no plans to attack Iran.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.571
The President said, "That's ridiculous.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.081
"We didn't even have plans
when we attacked Iraq. "

18:37.080 --> 18:38.161
David.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.521
Yeah?

18:40.960 --> 18:45.887
Remember a few weeks ago, in the car
on the way home from my mom's house?

18:46.080 --> 18:48.367
Yes. Yes, I do.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.486
Well, this happened.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.164
How the fuck are you going to feed a baby?

19:07.600 --> 19:09.170
Have you even thought about this?

19:09.360 --> 19:10.361
What are you going to do?

19:10.560 --> 19:12.085
Jerk men off the rest of your life?

19:12.280 --> 19:15.841
Yeah, that's the plan.
I'm gonna feed my kid by jerking men off.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.566
Sorry.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.723
Okay, good. Well, at least
you thought it through.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.445
It's not funny.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.601
Dude, I am so fucked.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.928
I think you should come work for me.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.890
What are you talking about?

19:32.080 --> 19:34.003
Seriously, I need the help.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.326
David, look at me.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.168
Bush opened the floodgates in Iraq.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.210
It's a fucking gold rush.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.171
That's really nice of you, Efraim.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.203
Fuck nice! Who cares about nice?

19:47.400 --> 19:49.368
I've been looking to bring
somebody on for a while now.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.040
The problem is, I don't trust anyone.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.530
But you're my boy.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.127
I mean, no offense,
but I'm against this war.

19:59.320 --> 20:03.041
Me and Iz are going to rallies
and signing petitions.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.890
Yeah, dude, I'm against the war too.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.605
I fucking hate Bush.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.205
But this isn't about being pro-war.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.448
The war is happening.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.688
This is about being pro-money.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.770
The more Efraim talked,
the more it made sense.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.928
Besides, compared to my other prospects,

20:20.120 --> 20:22.487
this was the chance of a lifetime.

20:22.680 --> 20:26.287
My only issue was, what would I tell Iz?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.568
I think it's a great idea.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.565
So I lied.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.525
You know I've always
believed in this business.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.726
I told her that Efraim
had great contacts in the government.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.485
And instead of selling bed sheets

20:38.680 --> 20:40.808
to penny-pinching retirement homes

20:41.000 --> 20:43.480
we'd now be selling sheets
to the free-spending,

20:43.720 --> 20:45.768
overfunded U.S. Military.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.530
It's genius.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.769
I had to lie. Iz hated the war.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.965
She had two cousins serving in Iraq.

20:59.440 --> 21:03.525
She also hated the mountain of bed sheets
that were taking up half our apartment.

21:11.280 --> 21:14.204
I spent the next six weeks
in a crash course on arms dealing.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.323
The Herstal 556 light machine gun.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.727
Belgian, but made under license
in lots of places.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.725
When it came to this shit,
Efraim knew everything.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.089
Makes, models, weights, where it was made.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.965
Remember, there's been an arms embargo
against China since Tiananmen Square.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.081
And if there was an angle to
be played, he knew about that too.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.362
You have to read between
the lines with this stuff.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.171
All the money is made between the lines.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.286
I'd spend my entire day
scouring the government's website,

21:39.520 --> 21:43.161
searching for overlooked contracts
that we could squeeze our way into.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.564
Hey, I think I got something.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.770
Hey, Georgia, I gotta call you back.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.405
And then, in the middle of the night

21:49.600 --> 21:51.841
we'd be back in the office,
working the phones.

21:52.280 --> 21:53.361
Forging relationships

21:53.560 --> 21:56.962
with weapon manufacturers
all over Eastern Europe.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.766
No, David Packouz from AEY.

22:00.600 --> 22:04.889
I told Iz we were doing conference calls
with sheet suppliers in Pakistan.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.242
They called guys like us war dogs.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.681
Bottom feeders who make money off of war

22:11.880 --> 22:14.087
without ever stepping foot
on the battlefield.

22:14.680 --> 22:18.162
It was meant to be derogatory,
but we kinda liked it.

22:18.360 --> 22:21.125
You fucking scumbag piece of shit!

22:21.560 --> 22:24.484
Drown, motherfucker, drown!

22:29.960 --> 22:31.041
Very nice.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.682
Ralph Slutsky was Efraim's silent partner.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.571
He was a local businessman

22:37.760 --> 22:40.809
who owned 14 dry cleaners
all across Miami.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.930
Why didn't anybody tell me
the mister is broken?

22:44.480 --> 22:48.929
Ralph put up the money to back the deals
in exchange for 25% of the company.

22:49.720 --> 22:53.327
Or at least what he thought was 25%.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.802
We're doing God's work, Ralph.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.809
We really are.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.048
You know, every Jew owes a debt to Israel.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.846
In my mind, this is not
a metaphorical debt.

23:03.040 --> 23:06.209
Ralph was under the impression
that Efraim was an observant Jew

23:06.440 --> 23:07.851
who only dealt arms as a means

23:08.040 --> 23:09.963
to protect Israel from her enemies.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.804
Beautifully said.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.447
Did you happen to catch
last Friday's Torah portion?

23:14.840 --> 23:17.286
- One of my favorites.
- Same here.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.086
It reminds me so much
of this story I once read.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.965
About a young man traveling to Pinsk.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.647
And that was Efraim's genius.

23:25.880 --> 23:29.202
He would figure out
who someone wanted him to be

23:29.400 --> 23:32.290
and he would become that person.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.646
Ah!

23:41.040 --> 23:43.441
And he's got, like, 20,000 of them.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.290
Great. Where did you find this guy?

23:45.520 --> 23:47.568
You remember Victor in the Ukraine?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.046
Yeah, the one with the Mk3s?

23:49.280 --> 23:52.204
Yeah. He turned me
on to this company in Cyprus.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.801
It's run by this guy, Henry Girard.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.081
Henry Girard?

23:57.160 --> 23:58.446
Yeah, you know him?

23:58.720 --> 24:00.722
You spoke to Henry Girard?

24:00.960 --> 24:03.167
A couple of times. Why? Who is he?

24:03.360 --> 24:06.887
Dude, for the last 20 years,
this guy has basically supplied

24:07.080 --> 24:09.447
both sides of every conflict
on the planet.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.165
He's a fucking animal.

24:11.360 --> 24:14.045
Really? Why is he calling me?

24:14.320 --> 24:16.129
Because he's a fucking animal.

24:16.440 --> 24:19.171
It's all money and it all matters.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.124
Hey, mami, where are you going?

24:21.760 --> 24:23.364
I'm trying to find my friends.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.886
You want to make some money?

24:25.240 --> 24:26.241
Excuse me?

24:26.480 --> 24:28.847
I'll give you $1,000 right now

24:29.040 --> 24:30.929
if we fast forward to our third date.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.691
What does that even mean?

24:32.880 --> 24:36.248
It means we just had a great dinner,
maybe met your friends for some drinks

24:36.440 --> 24:38.249
and now you're about to blow me in my car.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.805
Can we just get right to that part?

24:40.120 --> 24:41.451
Who the fuck are you?

24:41.640 --> 24:43.005
Efraim Diveroli.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.281
That's my best friend, David.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.084
And we're international arms dealers.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.406
But you already know that

24:47.600 --> 24:49.409
because we're on our third date.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.124
- What's going on?
- Nothing, bro.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.970
I'm about to get out of here with my girl.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.684
What the fuck, man!

25:07.440 --> 25:09.363
Oh, my God.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.363
That guy was not fucking around.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.728
Yeah, you probably should have
picked a different girl.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.526
Fuck that, it almost worked.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.442
Hey, do you remember when you fought
Eric Moscowitz in sixth grade?

25:25.680 --> 25:28.047
Yeah, he did that windmill thing
with his arms.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.208
That was the sickest. He was unbeatable.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.890
You remember that shit?

25:32.760 --> 25:34.125
That's it.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.243
Dude, he would have killed me
if you didn't jump in.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.530
Probably. Mmm.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.685
Hey, I never said "thank you."

25:44.240 --> 25:45.924
For everything.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.123
Come on, you know how much
you've helped me out lately.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.604
It's cool. You don't have to
make it weird, all right?

25:53.480 --> 25:55.130
Hey, can we order some food?

25:56.560 --> 25:58.483
Mami, come on.
I could have gone to Cuba and back.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.569
Met the family,
grabbed a couple sandwiches.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.886
I'd be done by now.

26:02.280 --> 26:03.281
Hello?

26:05.160 --> 26:08.323
Yes, sir. Sorry, I wasn't expecting
a work call this late.

26:08.520 --> 26:11.091
Right, of course.
It's 9:00 a.m. in Baghdad.

26:11.720 --> 26:12.721
Who is it?

26:12.960 --> 26:15.122
That's great news, Captain Santos.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.526
Yes, sir.

26:18.760 --> 26:19.966
We're going to get right on that.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.241
Thank you. Bye.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.441
What?

26:25.160 --> 26:26.321
We just got the Beretta deal.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.766
Get the fuck out of here.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.281
I swear to God.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.363
The Beretta deal was massive.

26:31.560 --> 26:35.360
It was 10 times bigger
than anything we'd closed so far.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.562
This was next level shit.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.410
That's what I'm fucking talking about!

26:39.600 --> 26:41.967
That's real money, motherfucker! Fuck!

26:42.640 --> 26:44.369
Do you realize we're going to make 600K

26:44.560 --> 26:45.891
on this fucking thing?

26:46.120 --> 26:47.121
Holy shit.

26:47.320 --> 26:51.086
David, your 30% is $180,000.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.403
Holy fucking shit!

26:54.880 --> 26:56.120
It was amazing.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.890
I'd been working with Efraim
for two months

26:58.080 --> 27:00.162
and was already about to make more money

27:00.360 --> 27:02.124
than a lifetime of massages.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.881
Listen.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.206
What is that?

27:20.400 --> 27:21.845
That's your baby's heartbeat.

27:22.760 --> 27:23.807
Wow.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.243
Can you believe how fast it is?

27:28.200 --> 27:30.328
- Is that normal?
- Totally normal.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.490
Fetuses have a much faster heart rate
than we do.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.401
Look.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.281
So, you guys want to know the sex?

27:42.560 --> 27:45.530
We keep going back and forth on it.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.083
- What do you think?
- Um...

27:51.120 --> 27:53.009
This is work. I have to take it.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.281
I'm so sorry.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.646
This is David.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.649
This is Captain Santos in Baghdad

27:58.840 --> 28:01.002
checking on the delivery
status of my Berettas.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.924
Captain, good to hear from you.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.288
Yes, we are on target. All good.

28:05.720 --> 28:06.960
Great. I was worried

28:07.200 --> 28:09.601
those guns were coming
direct out of Italy.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.882
Absolutely. They are, sir.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.082
Packouz, please tell me

28:15.280 --> 28:17.931
you're aware of the legislation
the Italians passed last week.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.801
The one banning
all arms shipments to Iraq.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.931
I had no clue what he was talking about.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.851
But this was a huge fucking problem.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.889
Berettas are an Italian gun.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.890
Made and manufactured in Italy.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.121
Uh...

28:33.520 --> 28:34.646
Of course.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.251
I am. I've been on the phone

28:36.480 --> 28:38.403
for the last three days,
making other arrangements.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.285
Great. That's what I wanted to hear.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.926
Iraqi police force is depending on you.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.361
Well, you tell them AEY
has got them covered.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.291
- Outstanding.
- Thanks, Captain. Talk soon.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.090
Everything okay?

28:58.080 --> 29:00.481
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.209
What happened? We done already?

29:03.400 --> 29:06.085
Yeah. Guess what?

29:08.360 --> 29:09.885
It's a girl.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.121
Baby.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.725
Okay. At least I hit something.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.843
Seriously, what the fuck
are we going to do?

29:30.240 --> 29:31.810
Relax, bro.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.247
Should I just call him back
and tell him the truth?

29:35.760 --> 29:38.491
When does telling the truth
ever help anybody?

29:38.680 --> 29:40.648
Efraim, we can't dick around with this guy

29:40.880 --> 29:41.927
and then not deliver.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.566
We're going to deliver.
I already figured it out.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.847
We use Jordan.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.766
Jordan Goldfarb?

29:47.960 --> 29:48.961
Jordan...

29:49.160 --> 29:50.525
Jordan the country.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.161
It shares a border with Iraq.
It's a U.S. ally.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.966
And most importantly, there's no embargo.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.129
Okay, so what do we tell the Italians?

29:59.320 --> 30:01.129
Fuck them! As far as they're concerned

30:01.360 --> 30:04.603
they're sending 5,000 Berettas
to a country they have no issue with.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.087
All we have to do is ship the guns

30:07.320 --> 30:09.004
from Jordan to Baghdad.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.651
It's called circumvention.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.201
Is that legal?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.486
It's not illegal.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.761
Want to try?

30:21.280 --> 30:22.406
How did that charity thing go?

30:22.600 --> 30:23.931
It was 5K, right?

30:24.120 --> 30:25.770
It was supposed to be a 5K.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.008
Uh, I finished about 1 K of it.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.248
So, I should probably return
four-fifths of the money.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.850
So, Andrew told me

30:34.040 --> 30:36.361
you and Efraim are working together now?

30:36.880 --> 30:37.881
Really?

30:38.160 --> 30:39.969
Yeah, I told her about the sheet thing.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.648
Yeah. Efraim has some contacts
with the government.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.889
So we're just combining forces right now.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.401
Yeah, just... Just be careful with him.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.568
- Emily, don't.
- What?

30:50.760 --> 30:52.000
How do you mean?

30:52.240 --> 30:54.891
Well, his cousin, Rebecca,
is an old friend of mine.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.451
We went to camp together.

30:56.640 --> 31:00.008
And she told me
that he stole $70,000 from her father.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.725
Whoa, really?

31:01.960 --> 31:02.961
That's interesting.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.730
I actually heard
it was the other way around.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.566
That his uncle is the one
who stole the money from him.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.040
See? You don't know.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.571
Everyone has their own version of a story.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.325
No, I'm pretty certain.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.409
Their whole family
stopped talking to him over it.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.450
Yo! Why aren't you answering your phone?

31:17.960 --> 31:19.291
Hey, what's up, man?

31:21.160 --> 31:22.161
Fuck is this?

31:22.440 --> 31:25.489
Everyone, this is David's
business partner, Efraim.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.843
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.690
Bro, could I talk to you
outside for a minute?

31:29.880 --> 31:31.405
- It's urgent.
- Yeah, of course.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.447
And for the record,
I'm also his best friend,

31:34.640 --> 31:37.166
so probably should have been
invited to whatever this is.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.445
Look, these are her friends.
This is her dinner party.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.768
Rosen is her friend now? That Jew fuck?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.240
Trust me, you don't want to be here.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.771
I don't want to be here, all right?

31:49.520 --> 31:50.521
Now, what's going on?

31:50.760 --> 31:52.444
Jordanian customs seized our Berettas.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.962
- What? Why?
- I don't fucking know, David.

31:55.160 --> 31:58.089
I dropped out of high school before
they covered international diplomacy.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.761
- Who's that?
- Fuck, it's Santos.

32:01.960 --> 32:03.007
He knows!

32:04.720 --> 32:06.006
Pick it up, I want to listen.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.646
- Pick... Pick up the fucking phone.
- This is David.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.161
Yeah, I just heard my guns
are being held up in Jordan.

32:11.400 --> 32:14.370
Captain Santos, yes,
there's been a slight hiccup.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.891
What are they even doing in Jordan?

32:16.120 --> 32:17.121
Not to worry.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.687
They're in a hangar in Amman.
Totally safe.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.571
My team and I are working
on a solution right now.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.285
You didn't answer my question.

32:24.480 --> 32:26.289
What the fuck are my guns doing in Jordan?

32:27.400 --> 32:29.243
Captain Santos, this is Efraim Diveroli.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.090
President of AEY, sir.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.290
David has apprised me of the situation and
we are looking at options as we speak.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.720
Options? What kind of options?

32:36.240 --> 32:38.891
Well, are you familiar
with the Corvus TP1 9?

32:39.080 --> 32:41.048
That's Brazilian and it's shit.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.481
Contract says Berettas, I want Berettas.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.762
Sir, I need you to work
with us a little on this.

32:45.960 --> 32:46.961
Let me get this straight.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.491
I'm in the ass crack of the world,
defending your freedom.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.603
And I got to work with you shit bags?

32:53.040 --> 32:54.041
Look, I don't know

32:54.280 --> 32:58.171
if those Berettas are really in Amman or
if you're just trying to goose your profits

32:58.360 --> 33:01.569
like every other piece of shit
in your miserable, rat-fuck profession.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.366
Either way, you're endangering my mission.

33:04.560 --> 33:05.607
I'm shutting you down.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.484
I'm canceling you for cause.

33:08.400 --> 33:11.244
Getting canceled for cause
was a death sentence.

33:11.480 --> 33:14.051
It meant we would never
win another contract.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.770
Captain, please do not do that.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.731
I know you're upset.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.843
But from one Christian to another

33:25.680 --> 33:30.129
my wife and I are having
serious financial problems.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.370
Our son, Lucas, is in the hospital.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.767
Medical bills are through the roof.

33:36.280 --> 33:40.205
If you do this, it'll ruin me.
It'll ruin my family.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.521
As God as my witness,

33:41.680 --> 33:43.648
I will get you your guns.

33:43.840 --> 33:44.841
Hello?

33:45.480 --> 33:47.767
What a fucking piece of shit!
Do you believe this fucking guy?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.240
- Fuck.
- What's going on?

33:53.000 --> 33:54.729
What guns, David?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.443
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:59.720 --> 34:02.200
You told me you guys
were selling bed sheets.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.210
Yeah, and I also told you
that we're selling other stuff too.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.164
I thought you meant pillows!

34:07.800 --> 34:10.371
Look, I can't support a kid
by giving massages.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.369
Okay? And nobody
was buying the bed sheets.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.164
No, David, you lied to me.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.447
Because I know how you feel about the war.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.563
I thought we both felt that way!

34:19.520 --> 34:21.170
I'm five months pregnant!

34:21.360 --> 34:23.248
And it's a problem
if I can't trust the man

34:23.440 --> 34:24.521
I'm having a baby with!

34:24.719 --> 34:26.848
- Of course you can trust me.
- Really?

34:27.080 --> 34:29.804
Because five minutes ago, I didn't
even know you were an arms dealer!

34:30.080 --> 34:31.605
I'm not an arms dealer.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.330
What we do is perfectly legal.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.768
We work for the government.
We're middlemen.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.167
We don't touch the guns,
we don't see the guns.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.647
We never even leave the office.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.444
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
It's time sensitive.

34:42.679 --> 34:43.806
David, do you have a passport?

34:44.719 --> 34:46.529
What? Yeah, why?

34:46.719 --> 34:48.960
We have to go to Jordan. Like, ASAP.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.571
Straighten this shit out.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.205
We gotta talk, whatever, okay?

34:52.440 --> 34:53.601
Yeah.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.041
Yo, you window or aisle?

35:01.880 --> 35:05.043
- Excuse me, sorry.
- Yeah, we just landed.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.850
- Excuse me.
- The Embassy call?

35:07.080 --> 35:09.731
Excuse me. Okay, bye.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.050
- Sorry, kind of an emergency.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

35:13.240 --> 35:14.969
Don't worry, I have to go first.
I'm American.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.321
I'm sorry.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.969
The American Embassy
offered little to no help

35:32.160 --> 35:34.640
in dealing with the Ministry of Customs.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.888
So we took matters into our own hands.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.729
He says your permit has expired

35:49.960 --> 35:52.406
and that you can't fly your crates
out of Jordan without one.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.204
Yeah, we know. That's why we're here.

35:54.680 --> 35:58.082
Look, we were told that
you know people in the government,

35:58.400 --> 36:01.165
that maybe you can help us out.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.971
He says it will take six weeks
to get a new permit.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.003
Yeah, that's the issue.
We don't have six weeks.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.770
We need our guns today.

36:22.440 --> 36:26.411
Look, I don't want to come off
as the ugly American here.

36:26.600 --> 36:30.161
And maybe I don't understand
the rituals of your culture

36:30.360 --> 36:31.691
but this feels like the moment

36:31.880 --> 36:33.848
where we are supposed to offer
him a gift, am I correct?

36:34.120 --> 36:35.770
- You are correct.
- All right.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.362
$1,400 U.S. Cool?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.361
Cool, man.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.684
Could have just started with that,
you know, saved all this bullshit.

36:47.880 --> 36:48.881
I like your shades.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.770
Tell him I'll give him
100 bucks for those shades.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.166
Tell him in gibberish.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.969
No way. Alligator.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.049
Yeah, I know. I...

37:00.280 --> 37:02.806
It's Lacoste. It's actually a crocodile.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.964
I like fancy shit, that's my thing.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.611
Tell him.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.084
For three days, we didn't hear anything.

37:13.880 --> 37:15.245
It was ridiculous.

37:15.440 --> 37:19.525
Our entire business was riding on the word
of an 11-year-old translator.

37:20.280 --> 37:23.443
Motherfucker! He ripped us off!

37:24.480 --> 37:25.811
We don't know that yet.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.207
No! I know what it feels like
to fuck somebody.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.641
I also know what it feels like
to get fucked by somebody.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.251
And we just got fucked.

37:33.840 --> 37:34.887
You need to chill out.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.724
How am I supposed to chill out, David?

37:36.920 --> 37:39.241
We're in a Muslim country,
I can't even get a blowjob!

37:39.480 --> 37:41.005
It's embarrassing!

37:41.840 --> 37:44.161
It's chaos here! Fuck!

37:53.200 --> 37:54.201
Yeah.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.001
Right now?

37:57.160 --> 37:58.525
We're coming down.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.290
That was Aladdin. They're in the lobby.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.721
See that? Come on.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.081
Hold on. Are you fucking kidding me?

38:07.320 --> 38:08.321
What's the problem?

38:08.520 --> 38:11.888
You wanted your guns back,
he got you your guns back.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.402
What? No, we said we needed a permit
to fly them to Iraq.

38:15.680 --> 38:19.082
Exactly, but you don't need
a permit to drive them.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.604
You expect us to drive them to Iraq?

38:22.160 --> 38:26.085
Why not? Marlboro is the best
smuggler in all of Jordan.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.561
Who, this?

38:27.880 --> 38:30.406
This is the best smuggler
in all of Jordan?

38:30.640 --> 38:34.725
Yeah, he drives to Baghdad
three, four times a month.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.206
Efraim, you want to weigh in here?

38:38.440 --> 38:40.408
Yo, how far is it to Baghdad?

38:40.880 --> 38:43.451
- Why are you asking him that?
- 800 kilometers.

38:43.720 --> 38:44.846
And he knows what he's doing?

38:45.160 --> 38:46.446
Efraim, stop.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.608
- 100% the best.
- Come on.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.684
It's like 500 miles.
We'll be there by morning.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.360
You seriously want to drive to Baghdad?

38:55.600 --> 38:58.331
David, we're gunrunners.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.325
Let's go run some fucking guns.

39:01.880 --> 39:02.961
Let's go.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.765
Come on.

39:11.720 --> 39:15.361
Hey, seriously, is this safe?
Driving to Baghdad?

39:15.560 --> 39:17.528
Yes, very safe.

39:17.720 --> 39:18.767
50-50.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.561
50-50? What, like 50% we live, 50% we die?

39:24.760 --> 39:27.604
Yes. That is why we drive through night.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.845
It is much safer.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.245
How much safer?

39:32.480 --> 39:33.720
50-50.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.331
Bro, what the fuck!

39:35.560 --> 39:38.484
Obviously, he doesn't know
what 50-50 means.

39:39.080 --> 39:40.081
Oh, my God.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.130
Hey, what about gas though?
It's a long trip, no?

39:43.600 --> 39:46.490
No problem. Petrol free in Iraq.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.166
No kidding.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.925
- Free gas?
- Yeah.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.244
See what I'm talking about? Iraq is dope.

39:55.080 --> 39:57.128
I'm thinking about getting a place there.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.080
Free gas.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.369
Fucking cool, man.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.001
What is that?

40:29.320 --> 40:30.321
What?

40:31.040 --> 40:32.405
You don't see that?

40:34.560 --> 40:35.925
What the fuck?

40:36.400 --> 40:37.765
Hey, why are you slowing down, man?

40:38.160 --> 40:39.321
It's okay, it's okay.

40:40.160 --> 40:42.208
What's okay?

40:42.400 --> 40:44.004
Whoa, whoa. What the fuck, bro?

40:44.200 --> 40:45.486
It's okay. Border.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.081
What, this?

40:50.080 --> 40:51.206
Fuck.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.641
- Jesus.
- Put down.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.001
- Huh?
- Put down.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.487
Whoa, whoa.

41:22.520 --> 41:23.521
Cigarettes.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.685
For you.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.401
Welcome.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.283
It was fucking surreal.

42:09.160 --> 42:13.165
Six months ago,
I was a massage therapist in Miami Beach.

42:13.360 --> 42:16.330
And now, here I was,
driving a truckload of guns

42:16.520 --> 42:17.726
through the Iraqi desert

42:17.920 --> 42:20.207
with my best friend from junior high.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.209
Marlboro?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.411
Hey, Marlboro?

44:13.440 --> 44:14.441
Bro!

44:16.000 --> 44:17.445
There's a dead body in the gas station!

44:17.640 --> 44:18.766
What the fuck!

44:20.520 --> 44:22.488
Where are we? Where's Marlboro?

44:22.760 --> 44:23.807
Did you not hear what I just said?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.206
There's a fucking dead body in there, man!

44:25.400 --> 44:26.811
Yes, I heard you.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.411
All right, we're in a war zone, bro.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.244
There's dead bodies, relax.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.444
All right, I gotta take a leak.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.041
What?

44:43.440 --> 44:44.441
Be careful.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.120
I'm good, bro.
I know how to take a piss, all right?

44:54.400 --> 44:55.401
Shit.

45:16.880 --> 45:17.881
Fuck.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.048
- Hello?
- Hey.

45:32.840 --> 45:34.444
Hey, babe, is everything okay?

45:34.640 --> 45:35.641
Yeah.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.445
What time is it there?

45:37.760 --> 45:40.001
It's, uh, 7:30 in the morning.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.684
Shit, did I wake you?

45:42.920 --> 45:46.003
No, I'm just at the hotel.
We're about to have some breakfast.

45:46.280 --> 45:48.567
Listen, I'm not saying I like it,

45:48.800 --> 45:51.485
but I get why you're doing this.

45:53.160 --> 45:54.207
You do?

45:54.560 --> 45:57.325
This whole time I never thought
about what you must be going through.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.369
All the pressure you're under.

46:00.520 --> 46:03.444
It's just the lying that kills me.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.443
It makes me feel like I'm in this alone.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.566
No, you're not in this alone.

46:13.680 --> 46:16.684
I need you to know
that you can tell me anything, David.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.723
We're partners, remember?

46:22.720 --> 46:23.721
David?

46:24.080 --> 46:25.525
Yeah, I gotta call you right back.

46:25.760 --> 46:27.250
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

46:27.440 --> 46:28.441
I'm just going to call you
right back, okay?

46:28.680 --> 46:29.681
I love you. Bye.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.843
Efraim!

46:32.480 --> 46:33.481
Efraim!

46:33.760 --> 46:35.410
- What?
- Look!

46:38.760 --> 46:40.888
Marlboro!

46:45.520 --> 46:48.251
Fuck! What the fuck, bro.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.726
Holy shit, they have guns, man!

46:49.920 --> 46:51.160
I know!

46:51.360 --> 46:52.486
Go, go! Come on.

46:52.680 --> 46:54.648
What the fuck! It won't start!

46:54.840 --> 46:56.171
Where the fuck is Marlboro?

46:56.360 --> 46:58.442
- I got it!
- Go! Go!

47:09.080 --> 47:10.241
No, no, no!

47:11.280 --> 47:12.770
Wait, wait, wait!

47:16.960 --> 47:18.883
Wait! No!

47:21.120 --> 47:22.610
Run, motherfucker! Jump in!

47:27.560 --> 47:30.245
Holy shit! They're getting
closer. Come on, man. Go!

47:30.440 --> 47:31.885
Go, go!

47:32.080 --> 47:33.127
Come on!

47:42.320 --> 47:43.367
Are you kidding me?

47:43.560 --> 47:45.608
We stopped for gas in Fallujah?

47:45.880 --> 47:47.041
You cheap fuck!

47:48.640 --> 47:49.926
Go!

47:50.120 --> 47:51.610
Fuck you, Marlboro!

47:52.480 --> 47:53.481
Fuck.

47:57.080 --> 47:58.525
Fuck. Fuck.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.370
We're gonna die!

48:00.600 --> 48:02.728
You wanted to drive
to Baghdad, you asshole!

48:06.800 --> 48:07.847
They're stopping.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.247
What the fuck? Look.

48:11.400 --> 48:13.050
Holy fuck, bro.

48:16.840 --> 48:19.650
Oh, fuck! All right!

48:21.880 --> 48:24.611
God bless Dick Cheney's America!

49:00.800 --> 49:03.326
Look at this fucking place. Oh, my God.

49:13.520 --> 49:14.726
Excuse me, sir?

49:16.920 --> 49:17.921
What?

49:18.200 --> 49:19.645
There are some guys here to see you.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.046
Some guys?

49:24.440 --> 49:25.805
What kind of guys?

49:26.000 --> 49:27.365
Hey, Marlboro!

49:27.680 --> 49:29.603
Give us a smile, gorgeous.

49:30.360 --> 49:32.840
Let me see those pearly yellows.

49:33.320 --> 49:35.766
You're like an Iraqi Tom Selleck, bro.

49:37.880 --> 49:39.370
You guys are AEY?

49:39.920 --> 49:41.684
Yes, sir. David Packouz.

49:41.880 --> 49:44.008
This is my colleague, Efraim Diveroli.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.131
We spoke on the phone.

49:46.480 --> 49:47.766
I remember.

49:52.760 --> 49:54.171
You drove these?

49:54.960 --> 49:56.962
Through the Triangle of Death?

50:01.680 --> 50:03.569
Fucking A right we did.

50:04.840 --> 50:07.969
Kip, take these boys over to the cage,
get them paid.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.161
Right away, sir.

50:09.400 --> 50:11.084
I was wrong about you two.

50:13.320 --> 50:15.163
Great fucking job, boys.

50:15.960 --> 50:17.371
Great fucking job.

50:20.800 --> 50:23.804
Holy shit, the Triangle of Death, bro?

50:25.760 --> 50:29.082
That's right.
That's the AEY guarantee, bitch.

50:29.280 --> 50:32.602
We drive through all triangles,
including your mom's.

50:33.600 --> 50:35.728
Hey, Kip, snap a photo of us, pal.

50:35.920 --> 50:36.921
All right.

50:40.720 --> 50:41.721
Ready?

50:42.680 --> 50:45.081
- How's my hair?
- It's good, slicked back.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.770
Thank you.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.121
- Got you.
- Let me see it.

50:49.160 --> 50:50.161
Helmut fucking Newton over here.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.481
All right, man.

50:52.280 --> 50:53.770
- Perfect.
- All right, all right.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.525
Let's go get fucking paid.

51:01.520 --> 51:02.806
Holy shit.

51:03.880 --> 51:07.362
Crazy, right? $12.2 billion.

51:07.680 --> 51:10.524
It's all seized
from the godfather himself.

51:10.720 --> 51:13.041
You guys call
Saddam Hussein the godfather?

51:13.320 --> 51:17.120
Look at all this cash, bro.
What would you call him?

51:17.320 --> 51:18.845
$2.8 million.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.887
- Just sign here.
- You got it.

51:27.240 --> 51:29.288
We got a military escort to the airport

51:29.520 --> 51:32.046
and got the fuck out of Baghdad.

51:36.880 --> 51:39.326
There was almost $3 million in cash

51:39.520 --> 51:41.761
stuffed into our Army-issued duffel bags.

51:46.320 --> 51:48.448
You might think
after barely surviving Iraq

51:48.640 --> 51:49.846
that we'd be done.

51:50.680 --> 51:51.841
But you'd be wrong.

51:55.960 --> 51:58.042
You see, the Beretta deal
put us on the map.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.289
After that, we started killing it.

52:06.800 --> 52:08.290
We bought matching Porsches.

52:08.640 --> 52:11.041
We bought two apartments
in the same building.

52:13.480 --> 52:14.891
Oh, my God.

52:20.400 --> 52:23.051
Holy shit, bro.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.246
Oh!

52:28.120 --> 52:29.121
Whoo!

52:32.040 --> 52:33.804
Ralph was so happy with his returns

52:34.040 --> 52:35.929
that he increased his original investment

52:36.120 --> 52:38.043
in AEY by $10 million.

52:43.520 --> 52:46.091
That gave us enough capital
to pursue more deals

52:46.280 --> 52:47.645
and expand the company.

52:48.120 --> 52:50.088
Which is exactly what we did.

52:56.760 --> 52:59.286
I cannot stress this enough.

52:59.960 --> 53:02.804
You need to be scouring this website.

53:03.080 --> 53:04.286
Day and night.

53:04.920 --> 53:07.491
It is updated by the minute.

53:07.840 --> 53:12.482
There are tens of thousands of
solicitations on this website.

53:12.960 --> 53:16.043
Each one is 40 to 50 pages long.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.921
If you see something interesting,

53:19.480 --> 53:21.130
you bring it to me.

53:21.760 --> 53:23.808
If you bring it to me,

53:25.520 --> 53:27.090
I'll make you rich.

53:28.440 --> 53:29.851
Fact, 18 months ago,

53:30.040 --> 53:31.963
David here was jerking off guys for money.

53:32.120 --> 53:34.521
Actually, that is not a fact.

53:34.760 --> 53:36.205
That is absolutely a fact.

53:36.760 --> 53:38.524
Now he drives a Porsche.

53:39.320 --> 53:41.084
And that's all because of AEY.

53:43.240 --> 53:44.401
Do you have any questions?

53:45.280 --> 53:47.203
Um, I have a question.

53:48.280 --> 53:50.248
What does AEY stand for?

53:50.800 --> 53:52.131
What do you mean? Like morally?

53:52.320 --> 53:55.244
No, I mean what do the letters mean?

53:55.560 --> 53:57.324
That's fucking...

53:57.520 --> 53:59.568
What does IBM stand for? Nothing.

53:59.760 --> 54:01.808
It just... It just sounds professional.

54:03.520 --> 54:08.686
Uh, actually, IBM stands for
International Business Machines.

54:11.960 --> 54:13.086
What did you say?

54:13.280 --> 54:16.648
IBM stands for
International Business Machines.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.611
Get the fuck out of here.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.683
I'm serious.
You're not going to work here.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.411
Get the fuck out of my office,
you fucking nerd!

54:29.000 --> 54:30.001
Go!

54:30.800 --> 54:33.610
And for the record,
AEY doesn't stand for anything.

54:35.320 --> 54:37.448
Fuck! What a dick.

54:45.080 --> 54:47.606
Does anybody else have any questions?

54:55.800 --> 54:57.529
Sleep. I got her.

55:11.720 --> 55:14.166
All right. All right.

55:16.520 --> 55:17.521
Hi.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.404
I know.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.561
I know. It's okay.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.201
Okay.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.366
What?

55:53.680 --> 55:57.605
360,000 SVD sniper rifles.

55:57.760 --> 56:01.287
1,084,000 GP-30 grenades.

56:01.600 --> 56:05.002
45,000 SKO aviation rockets.

56:05.880 --> 56:09.726
The Pentagon's arming the Afghans
for the next 30 years.

56:09.920 --> 56:11.843
They're building a whole army.

56:12.560 --> 56:14.289
Wait, that's got to be a typo.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.806
It's not.

56:17.280 --> 56:20.284
100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo?

56:21.640 --> 56:23.642
Bro, these aren't crumbs.

56:24.760 --> 56:27.127
This is the whole fucking pie.

56:35.720 --> 56:37.210
Among defense contractors,

56:37.400 --> 56:40.051
this would come to be known
as the Afghan deal.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.083
It would be the biggest opportunity

56:42.280 --> 56:44.044
AEY would ever see.

56:46.520 --> 56:48.249
We had to go for it.

56:51.120 --> 56:54.090
So, where do you go
to arm an entire country?

57:00.320 --> 57:02.891
Vegas X is where
military and manufacturers

57:03.120 --> 57:06.124
come together to unveil
the latest in warfare.

57:06.360 --> 57:09.842
It's like Comic-Con with grenades.

57:12.840 --> 57:16.640
Sure, most of these guys
didn't know who AEY was.

57:17.400 --> 57:19.801
But we saw that as an advantage.

57:21.200 --> 57:22.690
- You got your list?
- Got it.

57:22.840 --> 57:24.842
- You feel good?
- Yeah, I feel pretty good.

57:25.080 --> 57:27.162
You know, this is different
than doing business on the phone.

57:27.360 --> 57:29.044
When they look at us,
they're going to see two kids.

57:29.240 --> 57:30.366
So we have to show them our balls.

57:30.520 --> 57:31.521
Got it.

57:31.760 --> 57:33.489
We need to be fucking thugs,
you understand?

57:33.720 --> 57:34.721
Understood.

57:34.880 --> 57:36.962
All right, good. Let's kill this shit.

57:42.360 --> 57:44.328
But it was a complete disaster.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.006
We quickly learned that

57:48.200 --> 57:50.043
even if we could land the Afghan deal,

57:50.200 --> 57:52.567
it would be a logistical nightmare.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.240
Jerry, good to see you.

57:54.760 --> 57:56.364
To source a deal of this magnitude

57:56.560 --> 57:57.846
would mean piecing together

57:58.040 --> 58:00.884
multiple vendors
from all around the world.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.445
Whoa, whoa.

58:02.720 --> 58:03.721
Get out of here.

58:03.920 --> 58:05.684
It would require dozens of shipping outfits

58:05.880 --> 58:07.245
and hundreds of permits.

58:07.440 --> 58:08.930
We need 100 million rounds.

58:09.120 --> 58:12.727
All that could be okay
for a major defense contractor.

58:12.920 --> 58:14.251
But not for us.

58:16.520 --> 58:19.967
Honestly, we were out of our league.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.642
Change $10,000.

58:49.240 --> 58:50.605
Any luck today?

59:05.640 --> 59:06.766
Efraim!

59:10.800 --> 59:11.801
What's up, bro?

59:11.960 --> 59:13.325
Where you been? Why aren't you
answering your phone?

59:13.560 --> 59:14.766
I'm with a prostitute. What's up?

59:14.960 --> 59:17.122
Okay, you need to get dressed
and come with me right now.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.283
All right, uh, give me

59:20.560 --> 59:21.607
38 minutes.

59:21.800 --> 59:25.122
Efraim, Henry Girard is down at the bar,
waiting for us.

59:25.760 --> 59:26.841
Get the fuck out of here.

59:27.280 --> 59:28.361
I'm dead serious.

59:30.760 --> 59:31.807
Shit.

59:33.040 --> 59:34.201
Okay.

59:35.200 --> 59:38.010
Henry Girard was a legend
among arms dealers.

59:38.520 --> 59:41.683
When they hung Saddam Hussein
for crimes against humanity

59:41.840 --> 59:44.366
it was said that Henry sold them the rope.

59:44.640 --> 59:45.641
Hey, Henry, sorry I'm late.

59:45.840 --> 59:47.171
This is my partner
I was telling you about.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.328
- Efraim Diveroli.
- Nice to meet you.

59:49.560 --> 59:51.164
It's an absolute pleasure.

59:51.400 --> 59:52.686
Henry has a dinner in 10 minutes,

59:52.840 --> 59:54.365
but I wanted you to hear this firsthand.

59:54.840 --> 59:56.968
I showed him the list and he can help.

59:57.680 --> 59:59.409
Great. With which part?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.681
All of it.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.571
He can fill the whole order.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.004
- The whole order?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.645
Even the AK ammo?

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.530
Not a problem.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.566
You do know it's
100 million rounds, right?

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.689
Henry has contacts in Albania.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.367
Albania?

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.360
They spent decades preparing
for a Western invasion that never came.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.369
That country is one giant arsenal.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.528
It's all just sitting there.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.001
Tell him the best part.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.202
They're in the process of joining NATO,

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.609
so they have to dispose of all
of their Soviet era weapons.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.049
They are literally dismantling it
and turning it into scrap.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.568
I can get most of the shit
for pennies on the dollar.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.570
Now, tell him the other best part.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.043
You're looking at the exclusive agent
for the whole fucking thing.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.130
This was the magic bullet.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.247
One supplier who could
fill the entire Afghan deal.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.727
This wouldn't just put us in contention.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.087
We might actually win this thing.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.041
Sorry, I have a question.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.401
Sure.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.204
With that kind of hookup

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.289
why don't you just bid
on the contract yourself?

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.921
Full disclosure?

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.762
I'm barred from doing any business
with the U.S. government.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.086
I'm on a watch list.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.486
Like a terrorist watch list?

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.807
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.402
- Got it.
- Wait, what?

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.090
Okay, how much for the AK ammo?

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.482
- 10 cents a round.
- That's fucking amazing.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.721
And what about shipping?

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.450
You can get Ilyushin 76
through Russian pilots.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.681
80K per flight.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.769
I'm sorry, you're on
a terrorist watch list?

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.081
What the fuck!

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.282
Do you work for Homeland Security?
Relax, bro.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.404
You two should probably talk this over.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.126
We will. But we are very interested.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.601
Good. My flight leaves
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.802
I can't spend more than 48 hours
in this dump.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.920
That's what I always say.
Vegas is a two-day town.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.290
I was talking about America.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.963
We're talking exclusive access
to a stockpile

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.527
of Soviet Bloc non-standard
weapons and ammo.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.364
That's going to win this deal for us.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.965
He's on a terrorist watch list!

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.448
Whatever. People end up on that list
for bringing scissors onto an airplane!

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.206
That's not why he's on the list.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.523
Look, the Pentagon wants
100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.161
in the middle of a worldwide shortage.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.527
Where do you think
they think that's going to come from?

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.885
A bunch of shady motherfuckers
like that guy.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.488
This is the job.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.489
To do business with the people in places

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.690
the U.S. government
can't do business with directly.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.010
It's as simple as that.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.646
Fuck!

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.321
Hey, boys.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.171
So we discussed it,
and we'd like to move forward.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.404
Fantastic. Congratulations.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.722
- But we have to see the merchandise.
- Oh, of course.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.530
On site, in person.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.164
You guys ever been to Albania?

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.891
Honestly, until last night

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.764
I didn't even know it was
a real fucking country.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.570
Oh, it's a beautiful place.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.724
Come on in. I'll call my guy
and we'll set it up.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.608
Albania is a lot of things.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.002
But a beautiful place is not one of them.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.565
It took us three separate flights

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.081
and 22 hours just to get there.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.571
Henry's people sent a driver

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.250
to pick us up at the airport

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.091
and the guy would not stop talking.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.044
I fall over, she revive me.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.530
But none of that diminished
Efraim's enthusiasm.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.922
He really believed
this could be the answer.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.605
Welcome, AEY.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.441
I am Yili Pinari,

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.961
head of Albania's largest
military export company.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.447
Efraim Diveroli. Good to see you.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.131
This is my business associate,
David Packouz.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.964
- Glad to meet you.
- How you doing?

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.647
Uh...

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.286
Thank you for the sign.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.284
Oh. It's for you.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.330
Yes, I know.
I said thank you for the sign.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.771
So, show us what you got.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.485
What is this place?

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.642
Storage for the Albanian army.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.129
We have 700 more like it
across the country.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.322
You have 700 warehouses like this?

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.885
Not just warehouse.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.010
We use church, hospital, school.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.322
Albania is most armed country
in the world.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.284
Hey, that's cool. Congrats, bro.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.369
It was like a fucking museum in there.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.165
Most of this shit hadn't seen daylight

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.964
since the Cold War.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.810
But that didn't matter to us.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.207
All we cared about was the AK ammo.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.405
It's okay. We have plenty
of what you came for.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:35.526
All these containers
are filled with your bullets.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.009
What do you mean,
all the bullets are right here?

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.491
126 million rounds.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.647
Fuck me.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.526
Yeah. Fuck us all.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.401
How old are these?

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.724
30, maybe 40 years. AK-47 bullets

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.042
can last forever if properly stored.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.050
Right. Well, how were these stored?

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.611
Uh, who gives a fuck
how these were stored?

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.080
All that matters is they fucking work.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.566
Do they work?

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.206
You try.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.603
They fucking worked.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.363
The entire defense industry
was scrambling over this deal.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.604
And the key to it was sitting
in 23 shipping containers

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.124
in the back of a rusted out warehouse
on the other side of the world.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.770
We got back with just enough time

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.606
to submit our bid
before the government's deadline.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.400
And then we waited.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.442
We waited five months.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.166
Pa.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.131
David!

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.287
- Is that Efraim?
- What?

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.487
- Is it?
- David!

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.080
We fucking won!

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.766
Holy shit. We won the Afghan deal.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.485
- What?
- We won the Afghan deal!

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.926
- We won?
- We fucking won!

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.764
Bro! Are you fucking kidding me?

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.962
- We fucking won!
- Yeah, motherfucker!

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.281
Yeah! Yeah, motherfucker!

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.486
Before we could begin,

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.883
AEY still needed to be vetted
by the government.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.485
It's a pain-in-the ass process

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.165
involving three separate audits

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.971
and an in-person interview.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.687
The audits were the biggest hurdle.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.531
I mean, we didn't even
have a real bookkeeper.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.722
We didn't have real books.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.368
We had to fabricate AEY's accounting

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.408
going back three years.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.564
Ledgers, bank statements,
phony purchase orders,

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.643
we forged it all.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.084
Two weeks later, we were in Rock Island,

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:30.651
Illinois for our big meeting

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.729
with procurement officers
from the U.S. Military.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.243
We were pretty fucking nervous.

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:43.087
So Efraim thought it'd be a good idea
to get high in the parking lot.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.890
Hold up.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.770
Does it sound like
we're more than two people right now?

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:01.401
Yeah.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.246
It was really strong shit.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:05.526
Okay.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.245
This is very impressive.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.921
Very impressive.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.881
Frankly, we were a tad concerned
with your performance history

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.809
against a deal of this size.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.769
But after meeting you two face to face,

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.930
we feel like we're in good hands
on this one.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.487
Well, we won't let you down,

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.441
sirs.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.761
Not to mention,

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.810
your bid was far too attractive
for us to pass up.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.439
Thank you. I mean, that's great to hear
because we really worked hard on this.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.448
Sorry. Excuse me.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.167
One of you just said

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.728
our bid was too attractive to pass up.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.769
What did you mean by that, exactly?

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.964
He means you boys lowballed
the shit out of your competition.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.610
Yeah. Uh...

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.441
By how much?

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.961
Millions.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.245
Okay.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.285
Just for me. I...

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:21.170
I'm curious, how many millions?

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.967
Well, technically, we're not supposed to
discuss that with you,

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.844
but what the hell.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.130
You guys came in $53 million
lower than the nearest competition.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.760
Fuck! Fuck!

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.841
Motherfucker!

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.884
$53 million.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.850
We're okay.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.040
Look at the bright side.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.850
For once, the American taxpayer

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.162
is getting a good deal
on a defense contract.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.966
Man, fuck the American taxpayer.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.566
Hello?

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.201
Iz?

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.689
Hey, Ella. Hi.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.011
How are you, sweetie?

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.564
Hey. Do you know
where her blue sandals are?

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.366
Oh, hey.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.529
Um, I'm not sure.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.210
But listen, can we talk for a sec?

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.851
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.727
I need to go back to Albania
for a couple weeks.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.685
A month, tops.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.400
Sure. No problem.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.442
Hey, what's going on?

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.090
Ella and I are going to stay
with my mom for a while.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.765
What? What are you talking about?

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.801
Iz, what happened?

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.122
How come you didn't tell me
you went to Iraq?

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.771
I was looking for the plumber's number

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.247
on your computer and I saw the photos.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.807
I can explain.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.929
You said you never left
the hotel room in Jordan.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.766
I know. Because I didn't
want to freak you out.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.168
Why is it every time I catch you in a lie

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.768
you try to convince me
that you lied for my benefit?

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.325
At what point do you
just admit you're a liar?

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.603
Iz, would you stop, please?

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.565
We said we'd tell each other everything.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.324
- You promised!
- I know! Okay, I fucked up.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.483
What else aren't you telling me?

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:53.761
- Nothing.
- No.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.291
Seriously.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.241
You know everything now.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.684
Okay. Aren't you going to ask me
why I called the plumber?

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.122
Yeah, sure. What happened?

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.764
The pipe is leaking in the guest bathroom.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.005
I found this.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.041
Let me guess.
You didn't want to freak me out?

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.327
Okay, hold on.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.170
So I hid some money under the sink.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.441
What's the big deal?

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.642
The big deal is you hid it from me!

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:34.881
No, I didn't!

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.650
Then who did you hide it from?

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.528
I don't know. It was stupid. You're right.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.004
We're going to leave
before you think of something else to say.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.884
Iz, I'm sorry.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.851
Iz!

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.480
Oh, fuck.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.005
Hey, what's up, man?

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.281
What's up?

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.527
Just getting ready to leave.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.041
What is that?

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.730
I just wanted to thank you
for agreeing to go on this trip.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.400
It's not lost on me,

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.887
the sacrifice you're making
for this company.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.525
And I really appreciate it.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.404
"To my partner, David.
The world is yours."

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.685
- It's from Scarface.
- Of course, man. I remember.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.686
Thank you.

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.361
Yeah.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.760
Uh, hey, before I go,

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.605
I just wanted...

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.321
What's this?

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.928
It's our partnership agreement. 70-30.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.327
I just wanted to make it official.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.280
Yeah, of course.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.286
- It's a good idea.
- Cool.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.207
Man, eight fucking weeks in Albania.

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.841
Iz is going to hate me forever.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.961
No, she's going to suck your cock
every day for a year.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.126
Because we're on the verge
of making $30 million.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.406
Yeah, man.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.243
Go crush it.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.126
Thanks, bro.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.286
Nice.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.080
Hey, you've reached Iz.
You know what to do.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.921
Come on, Iz. Don't cut me off like this.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.367
I'm in Albania, at the hotel.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.609
Left the number with your mom.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.531
And if you could please just call me back

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.927
because I really miss you. Okay?

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.487
And I love you.

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.921
Bye.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.131
Good morning, buddy.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.845
Hey, Bashkim.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.684
Oh, I bring you Kolonat.
It's our McDonald's.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.402
Yeah, I'm good. But thanks.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.290
We go to work now?

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.082
Uh-huh. No, no, no.
I said I need two trucks.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.487
Yeah, you just got the one here right now.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.883
Yeah. Look, I got a cargo
plane sitting at the airport.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.929
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.801
Hey, let me call you right back.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.331
Hey, stop! Stop, stop!

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.289
Hold up, hold up, hold up!
Hey, turn that off!

01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.760
What the fuck is that?

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.288
Where did you get this?

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:08.921
Yo! What's up?

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.730
Hey, man, we got a problem.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.561
- Where you at?
- I'm at Liv, bro.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.366
Trying to bang some Cuban chick
who's waiting for me at my table.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.561
Why, what do we got?

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.481
Let me get this straight. I'm in Albania
right now freezing my ass off.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.966
You're at Liv, trying to get laid?

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.611
David, it's 1:00 a.m. here.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.285
I'm blowing off some steam.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.244
Yeah, 1:00 a.m. is when you're
supposed to be at the office

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.131
because that's the middle of fucking day
in every country we do business with.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.561
Look, we got a problem
with the AK ammunition.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.481
- What kind of problem?
- It's Chinese.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.445
Chinese, bro?
What does that even mean, Chinese?

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.165
It means it's from China.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.722
What are you talking about?
I was there, I saw the ammo.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.921
We both did.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.281
Yeah, look, I don't know what to tell you.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.680
They fucked us. Okay? We got played.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.611
Hold on. How do you even
know it's Chinese?

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.610
There's Chinese writing
on every fucking crate.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.609
Trust me, it's Chinese.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.881
Yeah.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.121
Henry, what the fuck!

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.930
We've been trying to reach you
for two days!

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.201
It's Efraim and David.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.851
We have a serious fucking problem.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.281
I'm listening.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.648
The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.729
What, you think the Afghans
who are getting

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.003
shot up by the Taliban give a shit
where their ammo comes from?

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.645
No, but the Pentagon does.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.365
Henry, you know we can't use Chinese!

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.289
America has an embargo against China.

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.246
You had your boys show us the one crate
of Albanian ammo in the entire country.

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.886
I'm sorry, did anyone prevent you
from inspecting the other crates?

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.488
Did you even bother to ask
what the country of origin was?

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.011
Who the fuck would ask that?

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.086
Henry, I'm staring at 100 million rounds

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.045
of illegal Chinese ammunition
that you sold us.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.480
What are we supposed to do?

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.484
Do your fucking job!

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.761
The U.S. government
wants to look the other way.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.007
Don't give them a reason not to.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.771
And while you're at it,
learn the difference between

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.725
"We have a problem"
and "You have a problem."

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.881
Fuck!

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.607
We were fucked. The ammo was worthless

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.889
and I was stuck in Albania
trying to piece together new suppliers

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.481
from all over Eastern Europe.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.881
Holy shit.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.565
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.841
I have a big idea.

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.006
How did you get in my room?

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.486
They let me in.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.645
I'm a trustworthy guy.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.531
Not only did they let me in,
they brought me room service.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.606
Anyway, I have a big fucking idea.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.326
Yeah? What's that?

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.800
What if we repack?

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.321
Repack what?

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.521
The bullets!

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.610
What if we repack them all?

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.171
100 million rounds?

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.131
David, it can be done.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.881
Think about it.
We'll also save a fortune on shipping.

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.162
We trade out all the big,
heavy wooden crates

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.925
for light cardboard boxes.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.202
Yeah, but it would still be Chinese ammo.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.643
Look at this towel. Okay?

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.767
Turkish. Made in Turkey.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.484
Not anymore. Now it's an Albanian towel.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.041
It's only Chinese
if the packaging says it's Chinese.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:53.927
Yeah. But I mean, that's
also fucking illegal, man.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.569
We have two options.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.041
We either repack this shit and send it off

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.971
or we can walk away
from a $300 million-deal.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.130
What do you want to do?

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:10.169
When you put it like that
there's really only one option.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.481
Our driver Bashkim
introduced us to his friend

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.047
who owned a boxing and storage company
out of Tirana.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:19.046
This is Enver. I grew up with him.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.281
Nice to meet you, Enver.

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:24.201
You too. Bashkim told me
a little about your situation.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:27.051
Yeah, look, to put it simply,
we have a weight problem.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:29.208
We're shipping
a large quantity of ammunition

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.129
from Albania to Afghanistan.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.765
Right now, it's packed in heavy tins

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.166
inside big wooden crates.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.566
And what we would like to do

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.564
is to transfer those bullets
into plastic bags

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.211
and then put those in double-walled,

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.765
corrugated fiberboard boxes.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.921
Do you know what those are?

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.527
Yeah, of course. For what reason?

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.961
We just told you.

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.531
What the fuck is it with this country?

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.646
The original packaging, it's too heavy.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.691
Too many crates. We need to streamline.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.249
Okay. How many crates?

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.410
A lot. It's 100 million
rounds of ammunition.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.083
Understood. But how many actual crates?

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.327
We have 68,520 crates.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.286
I've seen it.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.164
It's fucking crazy.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:44.961
Done.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.001
So 50 men, eight weeks.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:04.445
I can do it for $100,000.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.609
100,000 U.S. dollars?

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.961
Yeah.

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.324
- Give us a second.
- Yeah. One second, please.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.370
Okay. I'm going to talk very seriously.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.046
It was hard not to laugh.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.204
I mean, not only was this guy
saving the entire deal,

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.925
but by repacking all the ammo

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.528
we would increase our profit margin
by almost $3 million.

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.251
Where should we get dinner tonight?

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.722
There's this place by the hotel.
It's pretty good.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.122
Okay. All right, go ahead.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.601
Okay, deal.

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.123
It was even better than we thought.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:46.688
We were trading heavy wooden crates
for light cardboard boxes.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.645
Eight ounce tins for plastic bags.

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.085
By repacking the ammo,

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.886
we would lighten our overall load
by 180 tons.

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.287
180 fucking tons!

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:03.166
That meant fewer flights
using lighter planes burning less fuel.

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:07.883
Which all added up to more money for us.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.927
On December 8th, 2007,

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.361
AEY delivered the first 5 million rounds

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.562
to the Afghan army.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.409
It went off without a hitch.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.362
Come on, just say it once, sweetie.
Come on.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.604
Say "dada." Say "dada."

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.880
We really have to go, David.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.447
No, hey, five more minutes,
please? Please?

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.002
We're about to eat. My mom's waiting.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.289
Ella, wave goodbye to Daddy. Hmm.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.766
Bye-bye, Ella.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.169
Merry Christmas. I love you.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.326
Hey, can you give her to your mom
so that we can talk for a minute?

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.601
I'm sorry, David.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.081
We'll call you in a couple days. Okay?

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.121
Bye.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.401
Hey, this is David.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.285
Bro, you want to hear
something totally fucked up?

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.209
Merry Christmas, Efraim.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.481
It's Christmas?

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.727
That's why nobody's here.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.241
I was about to fire the entire office.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.124
Anyway, when I was over there,

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.322
I was talking to our boy, Bashkim.

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.601
Did you know his uncle

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.127
works at the Albanian defense ministry?

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.321
No, I didn't know that.

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.561
Well, he does.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.531
So I said, "You know what would be
interesting to me, Bashkim?

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:54.084
"I'd be curious to know what Henry
is paying the Albanians for the AK ammo."

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.281
Efraim?

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.045
Do you know what he found out?

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.722
That motherfucker is paying
two and a half cents a round.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.002
He's charging us a 400% markup!

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.009
Yeah. So what? We do the same thing.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.526
Yeah, but this is our contract.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.371
And we almost lost it because of him
and his Chinese fucking bullets.

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:10.561
But we didn't lose it.

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.841
That's not the point!

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.447
I want to figure out a way
to cut this cocksucker out of the deal.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.880
Efraim, stop.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.167
No, listen to me.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.044
I'm serious, man.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.480
We're making money, okay?

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.524
He's making money,
the whole thing is fucking working.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.085
Don't mess with it.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.726
I don't give a fuck. He's ripping us off!

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.921
Look, I'm serious, okay?

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.805
I'm going to be on the next flight
out of here if you pull that shit.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.807
Whoa. Bro, you don't have to threaten me.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.445
All right? I'm your partner.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.563
Yeah, it doesn't always feel like that.

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.403
I found this deal. And I'm over here

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.171
doing all the work and you're in Miami
trying to sabotage it.

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.289
How am I sabotaging it?

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:51.723
By trying to fuck over Henry,
the way you fuck over everybody else.

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:59.647
You're right. Henry's our partner.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.603
He's the reason we got this deal.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.847
I was just looking out for us
and I took it too far.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.562
Don't sweat it, bro. I'll leave it alone.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.926
Thank you.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.881
We can't push our luck
with this shit, man.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.805
All right, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.241
Whoa. What the fuck? Hey.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.561
Fuck! Stop.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.204
Stop! I don't understand!

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.962
Do you understand now?

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.001
Yeah. Yes.

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.763
Did you really think
you could cut me out of my own deal?

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.681
Please.

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:02.881
Fuck.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.521
Fuck.

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.281
David, we need to talk.

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.806
Now's not a good time.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.283
I have not been paid yet.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.010
What do you mean? Like for the month?

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.406
Ever.

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.489
You haven't been paid anything?

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.081
Your partner doesn't return phone calls.

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.163
My guys need to be paid.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.601
They are going to stop work.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.564
David, I know the real reason

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.444
that you want ammunition repacked.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.565
Okay, look, Enver. Listen to me.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.047
I gotta fly to Miami right now.
I'll be back in a week.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.361
But I promise you, the first thing
that I'm going do when I land

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.728
is make sure
you get your money wired, okay?

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.441
Okay.

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:08.641
David.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.201
Airport, let's go.

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.961
David.

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.727
Look, I'm late for a flight.
I'll be back next week.

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.968
She said her husband
didn't come home last night.

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.769
Okay, what do you want me to do?

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:28.008
She's very worried. It is not like him.

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:30.370
Tell her I don't know her husband.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.561
Who's your husband?

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.683
Bashkim.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.041
No one ever heard from Bashkim again.

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:50.642
They never found a note,
they never found a body.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.364
He just fell off the planet.

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.884
I was done with Albania.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.123
I was never going back.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.361
Hi.

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:15.841
Hey.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:20.207
The reason I went to Albania
was to repackage Chinese ammunition

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:23.210
so we could disguise it
and sell it to the U.S. government.

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.168
That sounds illegal.

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.928
It is. But I'm done.

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.491
I swear, no matter what happens
for the rest of my life

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:35.409
I'm never going to lie to you again.

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.686
Mmm-hmm.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.564
I love you so much, Iz.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.840
What happened to your nose?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.048
I was kidnapped by Albanian gangsters.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.571
- I think it's broken.
- Oh, my God.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.440
I think I'm going to go back
to being a massage therapist.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.040
Is that okay?

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.605
Yes.

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.844
It was always okay.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.370
Hey, you're back.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.961
Whoa!

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.401
Bro, what are you doing back?
What happened to your face?

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.568
That's everything that's been delivered
on the Afghan deal.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:01.881
I want my cut. I'm out.

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.766
What are you talking about?

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.362
He put a fucking gun to my head, man.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:08.881
Who, Henry?

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.690
You said that you were going
to leave it alone.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.250
Oh, fuck.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.688
I fucked up.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.087
I'm done, Efraim.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.282
Look, you don't have to go back.

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.885
I hired this new guy, Ivan.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.929
- He speaks Albanian.
- I'm done.

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:34.481
What, do you think
I just got 4 million bucks laying around?

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.040
I've thought it through.

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.208
I'll take 40 cents on the dollar.

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.243
Yeah, I thought it through too.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:47.761
How about this?

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.889
How about zero cents on the dollar?

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:53.165
Let me remind you that we have a contract.

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.686
Fuck your contract!

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.445
If I asked you to build me a house,

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.640
and you quit after building me half a house,
you think I owe you half the money?

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:01.922
Is this a fucking joke, David?

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:04.600
You have two weeks.
Otherwise, you'll hear from my lawyer.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.850
Who, Warren?

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:09.442
Are you talking about Warren?
He's my lawyer too.

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.841
I introduced you to him.

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:12.925
Fucking Warren.

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.601
Fuck!

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.124
AEY. How may I direct your call?

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:16.730
We fight.

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:19.845
Fight with our families,

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.809
fight with our business associates.

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.128
Sometimes we fight with our friends.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.401
If God were here,

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.965
we'd probably fight with Him too.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:35.288
Efraim has a heavy heart
over what's happened.

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:41.447
No offense, Ralph, but I'm not sure
you've ever met the real Efraim.

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.801
He's a complicated young man.

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.763
But he just wants to sit down and talk.

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.805
Find a fair solution.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.249
He's asked me to mediate.

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.164
Let me help you, David.

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.401
I just don't know if I'm ready yet.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.647
All right, here he is.

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.006
Hey, bro.

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.922
Good to see you.

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.528
Sorry things have gotten so crazy.

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.730
Yeah. Me too.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.570
You having anything, hon?

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.808
I'll just have a coffee. Thanks.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.964
I've thought about it a lot.

01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.600
And I don't want you to walk away
from this empty-handed.

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:46.801
Cool.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:49.611
So I had Warren draft up
a severance agreement.

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.285
And I think it's pretty fair.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:56.411
I'm prepared to pay you 50K per year
for the next four years.

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.046
200 grand?

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.524
Is this a fucking joke, man?

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.084
Is this what you meant by mediation?

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.560
In all fairness, there was never

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.728
a partnership agreement,
no prior contract.

01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.971
Yeah. I have something better
than a partnership agreement.

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.964
I have proof.

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.680
Before I left Albania, I took everything.

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:22.881
What the fuck.

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.811
All the documents we forged,
photos of repacking.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.081
- David!
- Repacking?

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.520
- He didn't tell you?
- David!

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.131
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:33.164
and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:36.211
then we repackaged it
and sold it to the U.S. Military.

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:39.085
Yeah, and we made
$8 million doing it, asshole.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.281
Careful, Efraim.

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:41.930
We told Ralph we only made
$3 million on that one.

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.121
Wait, what now?

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.964
He sends you fake accounting
reports every month.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.844
- Oh, fuck off.
- I make them on my laptop.

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.326
Now you're just making shit up.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.722
Really? Because I kept everything,
you dumb fuck!

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.571
I even have copies of the bank statements
that we photoshopped

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:54.807
and sent to the government.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.082
Get the fuck out of here.

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.124
I can bury you.

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.046
Us.

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.364
I think you meant to say,

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.882
you can bury us.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.202
Because anything that implicates me,

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:18.881
implicates you as well.

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.206
- Efraim, wait.
- No, no, no.

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:23.961
I came here today prepared
to pay you $200,000.

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:28.525
Now I'm not even going to pay
for breakfast.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.844
Oh. What's going on over here? Huh?

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.081
Hello?

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.123
May I speak with David Packouz?

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:47.322
- Yeah, who's this?
- Hi, David.

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:50.603
This is C. J. Chivers
with The New York Times.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:53.451
I was wondering if you had a minute
to talk about AEY,

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.962
and the alleged repackaging
of Chinese ammunition.

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.085
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.408
Well, according to my source,
there's an ongoing investigation

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.601
at the State Department.

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.444
And I was hoping
to get some clarification...

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:17.888
David, this sounds pretty serious.

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.411
Yeah, I know.

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.124
Maybe you should call my uncle.

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.086
The lawyer.

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.651
Oh, my God. Okay.

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.444
That's a good idea.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.246
Hey, give me a minute.
I'll meet you guys in the lobby.

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.721
You just get a call
from The New York Times?

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:49.041
Yeah.

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.881
Me too.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.881
You know, Scarface was on TV last night,

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.330
and I was watching it and thinking about
when we were little

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.851
and we used to do the lines
from the movie.

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.362
You're my best friend, David.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.000
God, I really fucked this up, didn't I?

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.924
I'm sorry, bro.

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:33.481
Wow.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.048
Are you ever not acting, man?

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:38.727
What does that mean?

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.287
You just tell me
what you think I want to hear,

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:42.481
because The New York Times called,

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.682
and you're freaking out
that I might say something.

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.486
Just admit it.

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.208
We were never best friends.

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.047
You were just playing
the part of my best friend.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.965
Yeah.

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.646
Scarface wasn't even on TV last night.

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.765
You're such a piece of shit.

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.603
- Fuck!
- Fuck you.

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.688
- Fuck.
- Little bitch.

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:25.324
Well, that saves us a trip.

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.967
Out of all the illegal shit we did,

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.007
all the lies we told the government,

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:11.000
in the end, the thing that did us in?

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:15.086
Yes, I'm trying to reach
the Department of Defense, please.

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.886
Efraim never paid the box guy.

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:23.047
To who do you report a crime?

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.724
After Enver called the Pentagon,

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.446
the State Department launched
a full-scale investigation,

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.489
that went on for months.

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:38.206
They busted Ralph at one of his shops
in the middle of a work day.

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:43.643
He was horrified
and couldn't make a deal fast enough.

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:49.084
All that bullshit about him wanting
to mediate a truce between Efraim and I...

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.406
It was a setup.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.204
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.125
and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:59.563
then we repackaged it
and sold it to the U.S. Military.

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:01.490
They had us dead to rights.

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:03.370
It was pathetic.

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:07.811
While going through Efraim's computer,
they even found a to-do list that said,

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.082
"Repackage Chinese ammo. "

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.486
The story tonight
that has Pentagon officials scrambling.

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:18.607
How did two 20-something young men
land a big Pentagon contract?

01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:21.929
Federal agents arrested both men
last week, charging them with fraud

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.249
for selling outdated, defective
Chinese ammunition

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:26.845
to the Pentagon.

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.967
Efraim was charged
with over 70 federal crimes

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.567
and sentenced to four years in prison.

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:37.762
I pled guilty and was sentenced
to seven months house arrest.

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:47.403
Congress called the Afghanistan contract
a case study

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:51.002
in all that is wrong
with the government's procurement process.

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:05.809
In 2022, AEY will be eligible once again
to bid on Federal contracts.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:17.800
How's it going?

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.841
It's okay.

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:26.364
If I wanted you dead,
you'd already be dead.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:33.246
I guess it's going all right then.

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:35.766
Come in.

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:43.964
How's your baby?

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.650
It's a girl, right?

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.729
Yeah. She's good.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.891
I got three.

01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.246
All girls.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.570
They tell you it gets better.

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:56.967
That's not true, it gets worse.

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:59.250
That's why I like the arms business.

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.647
No women.

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.440
I want to apologize about Albania.

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:22.641
I had bad information.

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.890
So you stuffed me in the trunk of a car
and shoved a gun in my face by mistake?

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.127
Yeah.

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:37.443
I'm not a bad man,
but in certain situations,

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.085
I have to ask myself,

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.648
what would a bad man do?

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:51.884
I appreciate you leaving my name
out of your testimony.

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:55.048
I didn't really see
a reason to include it.

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.765
Yeah, but still.

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:00.531
Can I ask you a question?

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:02.321
Sure.

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.486
When we met in Vegas
at the blackjack table,

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:10.605
was that a coincidence?

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.249
What do you think?

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.484
Can I ask you another question?

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:25.965
My driver in Albania went missing.

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:29.288
Do you know what happened to him?

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.764
It's a piece of my end on the Afghan deal.

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:52.931
It's for you.

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:09.768
No more questions.
