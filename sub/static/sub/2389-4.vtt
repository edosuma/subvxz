00:02.377 --> 00:03.710
<i>Kids, it was two days</i>

00:03.711 --> 00:05.328
<i>before Barney</i>
<i>and Robin's wedding,</i>

00:05.330 --> 00:07.780
<i>and everything was going off</i>
<i>without a hitch.</i>

00:07.782 --> 00:08.981
Ah.

00:08.983 --> 00:10.433
Been waiting for the
perfect time for this,

00:10.435 --> 00:12.001
and, my friend,
that time is...

00:12.003 --> 00:14.453
I saw you and Robin
at the carousel.

00:14.455 --> 00:17.673
<i>Okay, there was</i>
<i>one slight hitch.</i>

00:17.675 --> 00:20.059
<i>She called me to help her,</i>

00:20.061 --> 00:21.444
<i>and there you were</i>

00:21.446 --> 00:22.645
<i>in the rain</i>

00:22.647 --> 00:24.580
<i>holding hands with my fiancée.</i>

00:28.519 --> 00:29.736
What up?

00:29.738 --> 00:31.303
Nothing up.

00:31.305 --> 00:32.271
Everything down.

00:32.273 --> 00:34.440
All parts of me down.

00:34.442 --> 00:35.474
Look,

00:35.476 --> 00:37.860
you were busy,
so I-I...

00:37.862 --> 00:39.028
I went to the park
to help her look

00:39.030 --> 00:40.446
for this locket
she buried years ago.

00:40.448 --> 00:42.148
She couldn't find it,
she got upset,

00:42.150 --> 00:44.250
I held her hand. End of story.

00:47.204 --> 00:49.122
Cool! I just wanted
to air that out.

00:49.124 --> 00:50.706
You know, bro to bro.

00:50.708 --> 00:52.508
You're my best friend
and my best man.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.726
Of course I trust you.

00:53.728 --> 00:55.094
Oh, come on.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.263
You don't have to cry about it.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.932
It's not that.

00:59.934 --> 01:03.302
That was a $600 bottle
of scotch.

01:03.304 --> 01:06.105
Oh, my God.

01:08.193 --> 01:12.145
I hope Marshall gets here
for the rehearsal dinner.

01:12.147 --> 01:13.362
Thank you, Linus.

01:13.364 --> 01:16.482
He's somewhere in Wisconsin
in a rental car.

01:16.484 --> 01:18.117
Hertz?
I mean, it hurts a little

01:18.119 --> 01:20.403
but I'm not gonna
cry about it. Hey!

01:20.405 --> 01:22.538
We've been doing that
all afternoon.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.873
Oh, who's that for?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.458
Marshpillow.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.194
<i>Kids, as you may recall,</i>
<i>whenever Marshall left town</i>

01:28.196 --> 01:29.328
<i>for a few days,</i>

01:29.330 --> 01:31.447
<i>Lily would compensate</i>
<i>with a body pillow</i>

01:31.449 --> 01:33.966
<i>she dressed up</i>
<i>and named Marshpillow.</i>

01:33.968 --> 01:35.568
<i>Pretty normal stuff.</i>

01:35.570 --> 01:37.887
<i>But with Marshall stuck driving</i>
<i>across the country,</i>

01:37.889 --> 01:39.922
<i>Lily decided to upgrade.</i>

01:39.924 --> 01:43.309
Meet Marshpillow 2.0!

01:43.311 --> 01:44.811
Hey!

01:44.813 --> 01:46.679
Am I on?

01:46.681 --> 01:48.714
Hey, guys!

01:48.716 --> 01:49.999
Hey, Marsh.
Hey, Marshall. Hey.

01:50.001 --> 01:50.766
It's like you're
really here.

01:50.768 --> 01:52.068
Hey, Ted.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.271
Can you give me a
gander of the environs?

01:56.557 --> 01:58.274
Wow!

01:58.276 --> 02:02.395
This place
looks beautif...

02:03.730 --> 02:05.131
Wait for it.

02:05.133 --> 02:07.416
He's frozen.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.502
Same thing happened last night
at the worst possible time.

02:10.505 --> 02:14.674
I had just gotten on all fours
and taken off my panti...

02:19.112 --> 02:20.796
Now Lily's frozen.

This place

02:40.902 --> 02:43.236
Wow. Lily, it looks
like you really put

02:43.238 --> 02:45.071
some time
into this, huh?

02:45.907 --> 02:47.406
Though I wonder if

02:47.408 --> 02:48.774
instead of dressing up

02:48.776 --> 02:52.044
your giant husband doll
like Malibu Ken,

02:52.046 --> 02:53.546
you could've spent
a minute or two--

02:53.548 --> 02:55.014
I don't know--

02:55.016 --> 02:57.717
planning the weak ass
bachelorette party you threw me?

03:02.923 --> 03:07.376
I-It's possible I forgot
to send out the Evite.

03:08.345 --> 03:09.478
Robin!

03:09.480 --> 03:11.814
Happy bachelorette party!

03:11.816 --> 03:15.184
You invited Patrice
to my bachelorette party?!

03:15.186 --> 03:17.136
No.

03:17.138 --> 03:18.404
You know, it's funny.

03:18.406 --> 03:21.123
When I was planning
Barney's bachelor party,

03:21.125 --> 03:25.278
<i>I managed to wrangle</i>
<i>his boyhood hero, Billy Zabka,</i>

03:25.280 --> 03:26.946
<i>from</i> The Karate Kid.

03:26.948 --> 03:28.864
But you scored Patrice.

03:28.866 --> 03:30.333
I'm sorry, Robin.

03:30.335 --> 03:34.453
I-I've just been so consumed
with our move to Rome.

03:34.455 --> 03:36.222
I guess I forgot
to invite

03:36.224 --> 03:37.506
the girls.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.342
Yeah, Lily, I'd like
to show you how it's done.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.428
Billy Zabka, what
a great guy.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.314
Look at how thorough Ted was
planning the best man poker game

03:45.316 --> 03:46.849
he's throwing for Barney.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.852
Wait, I think I'm on some sort
of delay here.

03:49.854 --> 03:53.139
Best man visor
for the dealer.

03:53.141 --> 03:55.474
Customized playing cards.

03:55.476 --> 03:57.193
Barney's the king.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.611
And...

03:58.613 --> 03:59.762
the queens

03:59.764 --> 04:01.681
are naked.

04:01.683 --> 04:03.466
It was my first decree.

04:03.468 --> 04:06.686
Hmm. Plus, Ted handwrote
all of the table cards

04:06.688 --> 04:08.638
for the reception
in calligraphy.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.656
The man's a wizard
with a pen.

04:10.658 --> 04:12.925
Oh. I don't know
about all that.

04:12.927 --> 04:13.960
Though I was approached

04:13.962 --> 04:16.128
by the decorating committee
to make the...

04:16.130 --> 04:18.314
signs for our senior prom.

04:18.315 --> 04:21.817
I'm told they were
quite the hit.

04:21.819 --> 04:25.171
Hey, buddy, listen,

04:25.173 --> 04:29.125
you're gonna kill me, but I
forgot to bring the table cards.

04:29.127 --> 04:31.510
Uh, I'd hate to ask
you to redo them...

04:31.512 --> 04:33.896
Say no more.
The best man is on it.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.599
Thanks, Ted.

04:36.601 --> 04:38.701
S-So now the best man

04:38.703 --> 04:42.405
is painstakingly handwriting
200 table cards,

04:42.407 --> 04:44.857
but my maid of
honor forgot

04:44.859 --> 04:47.927
to click "send"
on an Evite.

04:47.929 --> 04:49.662
I didn't forget
to invite the girls

04:49.664 --> 04:50.997
to your bachelorette party.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.865
You have no girls!

04:52.867 --> 04:54.083
What?

04:54.085 --> 04:56.636
What?

04:56.638 --> 04:58.704
What?

04:58.706 --> 05:01.290
What? I...
All my girls.

05:01.975 --> 05:03.376
I gave you a list.

05:03.378 --> 05:04.593
This list?

05:04.595 --> 05:05.544
Yeah.

05:05.546 --> 05:07.246
"Tall girl from work,

05:07.248 --> 05:10.049
"mouth-breather
from coffee shop,

05:10.051 --> 05:11.384
"average-sized

05:11.386 --> 05:13.386
girl from that place"?

05:13.388 --> 05:15.638
Ooh. Sorry I didn't
track her down.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.039
She sounds great!

05:17.041 --> 05:19.025
She's actually
kind of a bitch.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.309
Face it, Robin.

05:20.311 --> 05:22.278
You hate women, and...

05:22.280 --> 05:24.280
women hate you.

05:25.949 --> 05:27.533
Ted didn't go to his prom?

05:27.535 --> 05:30.052
Classic.

05:30.054 --> 05:32.538
<i>While Lily was dropping the</i>
<i>ball as Robin's maid of honor,</i>

05:32.540 --> 05:35.825
<i>the best man was busy</i>
<i>knocking it out of the park.</i>

05:36.994 --> 05:39.278
Hey, buddy, listen,

05:39.280 --> 05:41.747
my great-aunt Ida has corns
on her feet

05:41.749 --> 05:43.499
and needs a first-floor room.

05:43.501 --> 05:45.334
Uh, would you mind
switching rooms?

05:45.336 --> 05:47.470
Say no more.
The best man is on it.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.554

06:01.319 --> 06:04.737
Hey, buddy, listen,

06:04.739 --> 06:06.522
the wedding doves
got here early,

06:06.524 --> 06:08.340
and I don't know
where to put 'em...

06:08.342 --> 06:10.860
Say no more.
The best man is on it!

06:10.862 --> 06:12.361
Thanks, Ted.

06:12.363 --> 06:14.747
Poor guys.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.366
All cooped up.

06:17.368 --> 06:22.037
I guess there's no harm in
letting you out for a bit, huh?

06:22.039 --> 06:24.440
They carpet-bombed
my entire room.

06:24.442 --> 06:25.741
Wish I'd closed

06:25.743 --> 06:28.427
my suitcase.

06:28.429 --> 06:31.180
And my mouth.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.832
Hey, buddy, listen,

06:33.834 --> 06:37.520
I see you wrote "N-O-period"
instead of the number sign.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.722
I'm worried that might
confuse the guests...

06:38.747 --> 06:39.606
Say no more.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.307
The best man is on it.

06:41.309 --> 06:42.725
Thanks, Ted.

06:42.727 --> 06:44.510
Here they are.

06:44.512 --> 06:47.679
Freshly penned table cards
in a pretty decent chancery

06:47.681 --> 06:50.516
considering I only
had my travel quills.

06:50.518 --> 06:53.202
Wait. Why's the
poker game started?

06:53.204 --> 06:56.021
Oh, um, the best man
moved the time.

06:56.023 --> 06:57.423
Mm, no, he didn't.

06:57.425 --> 06:58.791
Yes, he did.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.226
Heya, Ted.

07:00.228 --> 07:02.711
Thanks for the sweet lid, bro.

07:05.186 --> 07:07.517
Billy Zabka's
your new best man?

07:07.518 --> 07:11.153
He's the best... around.

07:11.155 --> 07:13.003
Sorry, Ted.
Maybe next wedding.

07:13.004 --> 07:13.532
What...

07:13.557 --> 07:15.824
So you're playing the best man
poker game without me?

07:15.826 --> 07:17.676
Tim Gunn's here and I'm not?

07:17.678 --> 07:20.446
I'm Barney's personal tailor,
of course I'm here.

07:20.448 --> 07:22.581
Plus, I've never
played poker before.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.833
It looks like a hoot.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.218
I moved into a dungeon.

07:26.220 --> 07:27.970
I wrote hundreds of cards.

07:27.972 --> 07:30.556
I even gave your batty
great-aunt Ida a foot massage

07:30.558 --> 07:33.542
so vigorous it put her to
sleep right there in the lobby.

07:33.544 --> 07:36.095
Yeah, I don't really have
a great-aunt Ida.

07:41.050 --> 07:43.885
So you are mad about me
and Robin holding hands.

07:43.887 --> 07:45.237
Of course I'm mad, Ted.

07:45.239 --> 07:46.322
Holding hands is, like,

07:46.324 --> 07:47.940
the fourth-grade equivalent
of banging.

07:47.942 --> 07:49.241
Well, in your case, 12th grade.

07:49.243 --> 07:50.292
Self-five.

07:50.294 --> 07:53.061
You broke the Bro Code.

07:53.063 --> 07:55.698
No, I did not. I only went
to help Robin as a friend

07:55.700 --> 07:56.999
because you didn't show up.

07:57.001 --> 07:58.650
I did not break the Bro Code.

07:58.652 --> 07:59.702
It's in the text.

07:59.704 --> 08:02.121
A bro shall not have
a weird moment

08:02.123 --> 08:04.673
with another bro's fiancée.
Well,

08:04.675 --> 08:07.459
too bad we're in Farhampton
and can't actually check.

08:07.461 --> 08:09.795
I am pleased to announce
that the Bro Code has replaced

08:09.797 --> 08:12.631
the Gideons Bible at select
hotels throughout the country.

08:12.633 --> 08:15.351
Oh.

08:15.353 --> 08:17.586
I'm sorry I said
you hate women.

08:17.588 --> 08:18.887
Yeah, don't be.

08:18.889 --> 08:20.723
For whatever reason,
I just...

08:20.725 --> 08:22.891
I can't seem to connect
with them. Down!

08:22.893 --> 08:24.743
Can you help me?
I've got

08:24.745 --> 08:26.228
a bunch more wedding gifts
in the van.

08:26.230 --> 08:29.965
Yay! I love Robin so much!

08:29.967 --> 08:32.034
Oh, God, I'm gonna strangle
that bitch.

08:32.035 --> 08:35.320
Robin, what is it
with you and women?

08:35.322 --> 08:37.423
They're so annoying.

08:37.424 --> 08:39.991
I'm glad that you're
my only female friend.

08:39.994 --> 08:41.960
Girls are always
whining and crying

08:41.962 --> 08:43.945
over every little thing.

08:45.115 --> 08:47.466
Yes. That's exactly...

08:47.468 --> 08:51.003
Thank you. "Oh, oh, boo-hoo.

08:51.005 --> 08:52.638
"Look at me.
I'm a sensitive

08:52.640 --> 08:54.556
little girl..."
Oh. God, I'm sorry.

08:54.558 --> 08:55.974
You're actually crying.

08:55.976 --> 08:56.892
It's just

08:56.894 --> 08:58.761
so sad.

08:58.763 --> 09:01.847
I can't be your only girlfriend.
Well, I...

09:01.849 --> 09:04.233
I don't need anybody else.
I got... I got you.

09:04.235 --> 09:08.153
For another six days and then
I'm off to Rome for a year.

09:08.155 --> 09:11.857
What are you gonna do without
our Saturday morning brunch

09:11.859 --> 09:14.410
with a side of sassy gossip?

09:15.278 --> 09:16.895
A one-shot power play?!

09:16.897 --> 09:19.031
Hey! Hey, Boston!

09:19.033 --> 09:20.332
Why not drop your hockey pants

09:20.334 --> 09:23.318
and actually take a dump
on the ice next time?!

09:23.320 --> 09:26.989
I love it!

09:28.325 --> 09:31.844
See? It is just too horrible
to even think about.

09:31.846 --> 09:32.961
Yeah.
You...

09:32.963 --> 09:35.214
need another female friend.

09:35.216 --> 09:36.965
Whenever I try to talk to women,

09:36.967 --> 09:38.825
they look like they want
to punch me.

09:38.850 --> 09:39.752
Well,

09:39.753 --> 09:42.721
maybe you're accidentally
giving off the wrong vibe.

09:42.723 --> 09:46.024
Like, what do you say
to other women at the gym?

09:46.026 --> 09:47.726
Oh, well, I haven't been
to the gym in forever.

09:47.728 --> 09:49.812
My metabolism is all messed up.

09:49.814 --> 09:52.197
See, I can moose down a pint
of fudge ripple

09:52.199 --> 09:55.901
for a midnight snack
and wake up having lost weight.

09:55.903 --> 09:57.069
Well, everywhere

09:57.071 --> 09:58.787
except for my boobs.

09:59.539 --> 10:00.873
So annoying.

10:02.525 --> 10:05.744
You're gonna need a lot of work.

10:05.746 --> 10:07.830
It's in here.
Somewhere.

10:07.832 --> 10:09.781
I... It has to be.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.867
Damn it, I know I should've done
these in alphabrotical order.

10:12.837 --> 10:14.503
Who cares about the Bro Code?

10:14.505 --> 10:16.472
It's just some stupid book
you made up.

10:16.474 --> 10:19.174
How dare you?

10:19.176 --> 10:22.511
The Bro Code has been around
for centuries.

10:22.513 --> 10:24.146
Nay...

10:24.148 --> 10:26.732
whatever's more
than centuries.

10:26.734 --> 10:28.016
Please don't launch
into a fake history lesson.

10:28.018 --> 10:31.770
The Bro Code can trace
its lineage all the way back

10:31.772 --> 10:33.989
to Broses himself.

10:33.991 --> 10:37.025
Article one:

10:37.027 --> 10:39.945
bros before ho's.

10:39.947 --> 10:41.413
<i>Okay.</i>

10:41.415 --> 10:43.282
I see what you're doing.
You can't prove that

10:43.284 --> 10:45.100
I broke the Bro Code, so you're
just making up stories about...

10:45.102 --> 10:47.619
This sacred text
was eventually brought

10:47.621 --> 10:51.273
to the New World
in 1776 by none other

10:51.275 --> 10:53.475
than Christopher Brolumbus.

10:53.477 --> 10:55.794
Article 62:

10:55.796 --> 10:59.932
a bro
who calls dibs first has dibs.

10:59.934 --> 11:02.651
Oh? Dibs!

11:02.653 --> 11:05.754
And that's why he got
to bang Pocahontas.

11:05.756 --> 11:07.249
Pocahontas was
with John Smith.

11:07.274 --> 11:08.174
Maybe

11:08.175 --> 11:09.525
according to the hotel register.

11:09.527 --> 11:10.943
Whatever Mrs. Brolumbus
didn't know

11:10.945 --> 11:12.311
couldn't hurt her, am I right?

11:12.313 --> 11:14.112
Well, except maybe
that New World syphilis.

11:14.114 --> 11:15.280
But I digress.

11:15.282 --> 11:18.150
Barney, if you believe
in the Bro Code,

11:18.152 --> 11:19.868
how come you've broken it
so many times?

11:21.038 --> 11:22.120
How dare you!

11:22.122 --> 11:24.489
I have <i>never</i> broken
the Bro Code!

11:24.491 --> 11:26.942
Hmm? Hmm? Ah.

11:26.944 --> 11:28.660
"Article 104:

11:28.662 --> 11:32.481
the mom of a bro
is always off limits."

11:32.483 --> 11:35.634
Okay, look,
we've all had a lot of fun

11:35.636 --> 11:37.703
joking about me
banging your mom.

11:37.705 --> 11:39.087
Not all of us. Continue.

11:39.089 --> 11:42.724
But I swear nothing ever
happened between the two of us.

11:42.726 --> 11:44.509
Trust me.

11:44.511 --> 11:47.128
And what's going on
with your fingers?

11:48.932 --> 11:51.183
That's how our bodies
were intertwined.

11:51.185 --> 11:53.085
All right, this
is ridiculous!

11:53.087 --> 11:54.686
It's ridiculous
that you won't admit

11:54.688 --> 11:56.405
holding Robin's hand was weird.

11:56.407 --> 11:57.573
It wasn't weird!

11:57.575 --> 11:59.074
Yes, it was.

12:00.193 --> 12:01.777
You know what?

12:01.779 --> 12:06.281
We need a third
impartial bro to settle this.

12:06.283 --> 12:07.766
To resolve this,

12:07.768 --> 12:09.518
I really need to parse

12:09.520 --> 12:10.769
the text of the Bro Code.

12:10.771 --> 12:11.920
It's too bad

12:11.922 --> 12:13.071
Marshall doesn't have a copy.

12:13.073 --> 12:15.240
Actually, I do.

12:15.242 --> 12:17.926
They were in the, uh,
seat back pockets on my flight

12:17.928 --> 12:19.461
in place of the safety cards.

12:19.463 --> 12:21.897
I'm also pleased to announce
<i>The Bro Code</i> is now available

12:21.899 --> 12:23.599
in select airlines
across the country.

12:23.601 --> 12:25.050
And Lufthansa.

12:25.052 --> 12:28.553
<i>Der Bro Code</i> is,
like, huge in Germany.

12:28.555 --> 12:30.472
Okay, so prove to me

12:30.474 --> 12:32.841
you can make a female friend.

12:32.843 --> 12:34.676
What about her?

12:34.678 --> 12:37.112
Ugh! The girl
with the bangs?

12:37.114 --> 12:39.514
Any chick who does that
to her hair

12:39.516 --> 12:41.400
is going through
a big life transition

12:41.402 --> 12:43.068
I don't want to hear about.

12:43.070 --> 12:45.988
Next time, grow your bangs
long enough to cover your mouth.

12:45.990 --> 12:47.122
Ha-pass.

12:47.124 --> 12:48.607
Okay, well...

12:48.609 --> 12:50.242
what about her?

12:50.244 --> 12:52.394
Ugh! Comfortable shoes?

12:53.497 --> 12:55.580
What, are you filibustering
later?

12:55.582 --> 12:57.466
It's after 5:00.
Put on some heels.

12:57.468 --> 12:58.467
Ha-pass.

12:58.469 --> 13:01.553
Okay, well, what about...?
Ugh!

13:01.555 --> 13:03.722
I haven't even pointed
to anyone yet!

13:03.724 --> 13:05.474
<i>Now,</i>

13:05.476 --> 13:09.111
although not expressly stated
in the Bro Code,

13:09.113 --> 13:11.229
a weird moment between

13:11.231 --> 13:13.899
a bro and his bro's fiancée is,

13:13.901 --> 13:17.152
in my bropinion... a violation.

13:17.154 --> 13:18.737
No!
Yes! However,

13:18.739 --> 13:21.056
Ted was helping Robin
as a friend.

13:21.058 --> 13:22.190
Therefore,

13:22.192 --> 13:23.291
holding her hand

13:23.293 --> 13:25.944
isn't <i>necessarily</i>
a weird moment.

13:25.946 --> 13:27.562
No!
Yes!

13:27.564 --> 13:28.580
That being said...

13:28.582 --> 13:29.865
What?

13:29.867 --> 13:31.066
...if we decide

13:31.068 --> 13:33.618
that holding <i>any</i> friend's hand
is weird,

13:33.620 --> 13:36.605
then, yes,
Ted did break the Bro Code.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.806
So, the question
is this.

13:37.808 --> 13:39.558
If Ted had gone to the park

13:39.560 --> 13:41.543
and held <i>Barney's</i> hand,

13:41.545 --> 13:43.779
would it have been weird?

13:44.580 --> 13:47.015
No?
Yes?

13:51.287 --> 13:53.305
See?

13:55.025 --> 13:58.060
It's not weird at all.

13:59.512 --> 14:00.445
I don't know what to say.

14:00.447 --> 14:01.613
Just be yourself.

14:01.615 --> 14:02.898
Say something nice.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.783
Which one? I can't do both.

14:09.105 --> 14:11.106
Slut alert.

14:11.108 --> 14:12.874
That's my 14-year-old daughter.

14:14.961 --> 14:17.028
Crappy mom alert.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.163
Ugh!

14:18.165 --> 14:19.815
It's you. Nice bangs.

14:21.801 --> 14:23.802
What is wrong with you?!

14:23.804 --> 14:25.987
I can't do this, okay?

14:25.989 --> 14:27.422
I was raised as a boy.

14:27.424 --> 14:28.924
I don't get along with women.

14:28.926 --> 14:30.726
Can we just drop it?

14:30.728 --> 14:33.061
Okay, I never thought
I'd take a page

14:33.063 --> 14:35.797
out of your fiancé's
playbook, but...

14:35.799 --> 14:39.768
it's time to target
the crying chick.

14:41.354 --> 14:44.322
Not weird at all.

14:44.324 --> 14:46.024
Marshall,

14:46.026 --> 14:47.609
why are we
doing this?!

14:47.611 --> 14:50.195
Two dudes on a beach
with a lifeless blob

14:50.197 --> 14:51.813
they're pretending
is alive?

14:51.815 --> 14:53.031
It's stupid.

14:53.033 --> 14:54.199
So, I guess that means

14:54.201 --> 14:56.501
<i>Weekend at Bernie's</i>
is stupid, too.

14:57.371 --> 14:58.453
E-Lawyered.

14:58.455 --> 15:00.288
Now, before

15:00.290 --> 15:01.506
I can render a decision,

15:01.508 --> 15:03.158
we need to recreate
the variables

15:03.160 --> 15:05.377
at the carousel
as closely as possible.

15:05.379 --> 15:08.630
Since Ted says
that he was comforting Robin,

15:08.632 --> 15:09.831
he needs to do

15:09.833 --> 15:13.919
the same for Barney,
so, Ted, comfort Barney.

15:13.921 --> 15:15.687
I don't see how that...

15:15.689 --> 15:17.639
Comfort... Barney.

15:19.610 --> 15:23.111
Barney, what is
going on with you?

15:23.113 --> 15:25.514
Why are you
so upset with me?

15:25.516 --> 15:28.283
Marshall, this is stupid!
I don't...

15:28.285 --> 15:29.985
Accept the comfort.

15:29.987 --> 15:32.404
Fine!

15:33.657 --> 15:36.741
I guess... I'm not
really mad at you.

15:36.743 --> 15:38.910
I'm mad at myself.
I should have met Robin

15:38.912 --> 15:40.829
at the carousel when she called,

15:40.831 --> 15:44.032
but I was having such a good
time greasing 12-year-olds.

15:44.034 --> 15:45.000
Laser tag.

15:45.002 --> 15:47.219
Helpful. Continue.

15:48.554 --> 15:51.706
Look, Ted, I'm sorry that
I've been taking it out on you.

15:51.708 --> 15:54.192
You were just being
a good friend to Robin.

15:54.194 --> 15:56.511
It's okay.

15:56.513 --> 15:58.930
It would be different if
you still had feelings for her,

15:58.932 --> 16:01.066
but you don't, right?

16:02.685 --> 16:05.270
Right?

16:11.393 --> 16:12.928
Okay, now it's weird.

16:16.502 --> 16:19.020
You still have
feelings for Robin?!

16:19.022 --> 16:22.407
What?! What?! What?! What?!

16:22.409 --> 16:24.042
Okay, yes, sometimes I do.

16:24.044 --> 16:25.477
Well, then, turn 'em off!

16:25.479 --> 16:27.512
I would love to,
but it doesn't work that way!

16:27.514 --> 16:30.482
I'm a... I'm a human being.
I-I-I don't have an off switch.

16:30.484 --> 16:32.651
I'm shutting off.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.371
There, there.

16:36.373 --> 16:38.373
Sister?

16:38.375 --> 16:41.493
Who needs a lady hug?

16:41.495 --> 16:43.545
Ugh! What the hell
are you doing?!

16:43.547 --> 16:46.064
Wait. Did you just
"ugh" my hug?

16:46.066 --> 16:47.165
I don't need a hug.

16:47.167 --> 16:48.249
I'm pissed off because

16:48.251 --> 16:50.885
the Rangers just lost
to the Boston Bruins.

16:50.887 --> 16:53.204
I hate the Boston Bruins!

16:57.159 --> 16:58.843
Look, Barney,
I hate these feelings.

16:58.845 --> 17:00.812
I hate myself
for having these feelings.

17:00.814 --> 17:03.598
No one wishes they would go away
more than I do,

17:03.600 --> 17:06.935
but I just... I... I can't seem
to make that happen. I've tried.

17:06.936 --> 17:08.386
Well, then, try harder!

17:08.387 --> 17:10.405
I'm marrying her
in less than two days!

17:10.406 --> 17:13.023
What the hell are we gonna do
about this?!

17:14.893 --> 17:18.195
<i>As she watched Robin make</i>
<i>a new friend, Lily was happy...</i>

17:18.198 --> 17:21.366
<i>for two seconds.</i>

17:21.367 --> 17:23.167
Oh, no!
Oh, come on, ref!

17:23.170 --> 17:25.086
I haven't seen that much
hooking go unpunished

17:25.088 --> 17:26.838
since my last
trip to Vegas.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.708
And I was on that trip,
because we are best friends now.

17:30.794 --> 17:32.711
Hey,

17:32.713 --> 17:34.896
this might sound
a little nutty, but

17:34.898 --> 17:37.248
how about
we inject a sexual edge

17:37.250 --> 17:38.633
into our abiding friendship
that...

17:38.635 --> 17:42.270
...in no way jeopardizes
our emotional connection,

17:42.272 --> 17:44.189
or respective marriages?!

17:45.225 --> 17:46.441
<i>Aw!</i>

17:46.443 --> 17:47.425
<i>Hell,</i> no!

17:47.427 --> 17:49.477
Excuse me.

17:49.479 --> 17:52.447
I've got a Boston Brewin',
if you know what I mean.

17:54.117 --> 17:56.368
You listen, and you listen good.

17:56.370 --> 17:58.286
If I see your face
around Robin again,

17:58.288 --> 18:00.205
you will be crying
about a lot more

18:00.207 --> 18:02.207
than your precious
New York Rogers.

18:02.209 --> 18:03.958
Rangers?
I will cut you!

18:09.348 --> 18:11.383
Forgot my purse.

18:13.553 --> 18:14.969
You know what?

18:14.971 --> 18:16.921
That's why I only need you.

18:16.923 --> 18:18.807
'Cause you're a psycho.

18:18.809 --> 18:20.742
My psycho.

18:20.744 --> 18:23.595
I am, aren't I?
Mm-hmm.

18:26.817 --> 18:28.083
There's the blushing bride!

18:28.085 --> 18:30.151
Back off, Patrice!

18:31.303 --> 18:35.973
Look, Barney, the truth is,
it was weird at the carousel.

18:35.975 --> 18:37.325
On some level,
it's probably been weird

18:37.327 --> 18:39.327
between me and Robin
ever since we broke up.

18:39.329 --> 18:40.412
But you're my brother.

18:40.414 --> 18:41.579
I would never do anything

18:41.581 --> 18:42.947
to hurt you, ever.

18:42.949 --> 18:44.666
I mean it, I swear!

18:44.668 --> 18:46.984
I'll-I'll even swear it
on the Bro Code.

18:46.986 --> 18:48.086
The Bro Code's stupid.

18:48.088 --> 18:49.987
How dare you!

18:51.540 --> 18:52.757
I'd be honored.

18:57.713 --> 19:01.216
I can't promise that I'll ever
get to a place where it won't be

19:01.218 --> 19:03.551
at least a little weird
between me and Robin.

19:03.553 --> 19:07.272
But I don't want to lose you
as a friend, either of you.

19:08.290 --> 19:10.308
So I will do everything I can

19:10.310 --> 19:12.977
to move on and live with it.

19:12.979 --> 19:17.348
The question is... can you?

19:21.872 --> 19:25.206
I'm sorry, Ted.
I just... can't do this.

19:25.208 --> 19:27.859
I fold.

19:27.861 --> 19:31.379
What about the best man?

19:35.468 --> 19:36.468
I fold, too.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.253
I fold.

19:38.255 --> 19:39.537
There goes my belly buster.

19:39.539 --> 19:40.889
You sandbag all night,

19:40.891 --> 19:43.374
only to bluff a couple
of rags, pre-flop,

19:43.376 --> 19:45.093
and wind up
with a dry board.

19:45.095 --> 19:46.327
That's what you get

19:46.329 --> 19:49.731
for limping in shorts-tacked
with a pack of donkeys.

19:49.733 --> 19:51.850
Muck city.

19:54.186 --> 19:55.153
I fold!

19:55.155 --> 19:56.387
Yeah...
Oh, right. I knew that.

19:56.389 --> 19:58.022
I knew that, I knew that,
I knew that.

19:58.024 --> 19:59.324
Okay, two
players left.

20:06.231 --> 20:07.582
You are bluffing, robot man.

20:07.584 --> 20:09.200
I raise.

20:09.202 --> 20:10.869
Oh.

20:10.871 --> 20:12.904
Hey, Billy, do you mind

20:12.906 --> 20:16.341
pushing my chips
into the center of the pot?

20:16.343 --> 20:19.627
Preferably with gusto,
because...

20:19.629 --> 20:21.863
I'm all in!

20:21.865 --> 20:23.915
Oh!
Oh, boy!

20:23.917 --> 20:26.184
- All right, all right.
- Oh!

20:29.806 --> 20:32.273
<i>And that's how I became</i>
<i>Barney's best man again.</i>

20:32.275 --> 20:35.810
<i>Everything was back</i>
<i>to going off without a hitch.</i>

20:35.812 --> 20:38.863
I'm coming for you, Mosby.

20:38.865 --> 20:40.982
<i>Okay, there was one</i>
<i>slight hitch.</i>
