By now, kalel,
you are entering

06:29.404 --> 06:32.407
The atmosphere of
the planet known as earth.

06:32.407 --> 06:35.911
I pray you have made
a safe journey.

06:35.911 --> 06:38.413
The yellow sun
of your new home

06:38.914 --> 06:41.416

great physical powers,

Krypton,
your mother planet.

06:57.933 --> 06:59.434
It is my lastgift

06:59.935 --> 07:02.938
Once removed,

07:02.938 --> 07:05.941
The ship will grow
cold and silent,

07:05.941 --> 07:08.944
And you will
be finally alone.

07:08.944 --> 07:15.450
The power in the module

Nice to see you.
It's been a long time.

A long time.

08:06.218 --> 08:08.220

08:09.721 --> 08:11.723
There's an offer
to buy sight unseen?

08:11.723 --> 08:15.227
I won't sell
to a big developer.

08:15.227 --> 08:18.230
Anybody who buys it
has to want a real farm.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.731
I don't think we need
another shopping center.

08:19.731 --> 08:23.235
Darn it, Clark,
why are you so stubborn?

08:23.235 --> 08:25.737
Today,
nobody wants a farm.

08:25.737 --> 08:29.741
You blink your eye,

Oh, my gosh,
look at this.

08:37.249 --> 08:41.253
Oh, what a joker
old Jonathan Kent was.

08:41.253 --> 08:45.757
I asked him what happened
to the baby's crib,

08:45.757 --> 08:48.260
And he said...

08:48.260 --> 08:52.764
"little Clark must have
had a bad dream and kicked it."

08:52.764 --> 08:55.767
Yeah, dad liked
a good joke.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.269
I was wondering,
mr. Hornsby,

08:57.269 --> 08:58.770
Maybe you'd like
to keep these

08:58.770 --> 09:01.273
For your
grandchildren.

09:01.273 --> 09:04.276

about the place.

for a real farmer.

09:33.805 --> 09:34.806
You are?

09:37.309 --> 09:39.811
You're just as obstinate
as your father was, too.

09:40.312 --> 09:42.314
I'm sorry.
That's just how it is.

09:42.314 --> 09:44.316
You be careful
when you get back

09:44.316 --> 09:45.317

Life itself started
in a murky pit much like this.

No! Ha ha ha!

to tell you this.

17:32.066 --> 17:36.571
I just don't think he'd be
attracted to somebody like you.

17:36.571 --> 17:39.073
Don't be silly.
All men like me.

17:39.073 --> 17:41.075
I'm very, very rich.

17:41.409 --> 17:44.495
Why don't you have

17:44.495 --> 17:46.497

get air sick,

It won't be
that terrible.

18:04.515 --> 18:06.517
Hopefully,
very terrible, miss Lane.

With a good
international crisis.

18:11.022 --> 18:13.524
And because
the summit has failed,

18:13.524 --> 18:15.526
We have no choice

18:16.027 --> 18:18.529
But to strive
to be second to none

18:19.030 --> 18:20.531
In the nuclear arms race.

18:21.032 --> 18:25.036
Therefore, i am announcing
the following measures--

18:28.539 --> 18:31.542
I know you're all upset
by the crisis.

18:31.542 --> 18:35.546
The best thing we can do
is think positively.

18:35.546 --> 18:39.050
Now, is there
anything we can do?

18:39.050 --> 18:41.052
Doesn't anyone
have a suggestion?

18:42.053 --> 18:44.055
All right.

18:44.055 --> 18:46.057
I'll make a suggestion.

18:47.558 --> 18:49.060
Let's write
our congressmen.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.062
That'll do
a lot of good.

18:51.062 --> 18:55.066
Somebody has to be
an optimist.

18:55.066 --> 18:56.567
Jeremy?

18:58.069 --> 19:01.072
What can we do
about the crisis?

19:01.072 --> 19:02.573
He doesn't know
what's happening.

19:03.074 --> 19:07.578
I'd write a letter to someone
that would do some good.

19:08.079 --> 19:09.080
Who, santa claus?

19:09.580 --> 19:11.582
No! Superman!

19:11.582 --> 19:14.085
Superman, the subject
of our newest exhibit,

19:14.085 --> 19:17.088
Has graciously donated a strand
of his hair to the museum,

19:17.588 --> 19:20.591
So we can see how strong
he really is.

19:21.092 --> 19:23.594
Here you can see
a 1,000-Pound load

19:24.095 --> 19:25.596
Easily suspended
by his single hair.

19:26.097 --> 19:28.099
The museum will
be closing soon,

19:28.599 --> 19:31.102
So we should
hurry a little.

19:32.103 --> 19:35.106
You know what
i can do with that hair?

19:35.606 --> 19:38.609
You can make
a toupee that flies.

19:38.609 --> 19:40.111
That hair is a sample

19:40.111 --> 19:42.113
Of superman's
genetic material,

19:42.613 --> 19:44.615
The building blocks
of his body.

19:45.116 --> 19:48.119
With enough nuclear power
to mutate the genes,

19:48.619 --> 19:53.124
I can create a being who's
more powerful than him,

19:53.624 --> 19:56.627
Who has total
allegiance to me.

19:57.628 --> 19:59.130
[Snap]

20:05.136 --> 20:06.637
You better
stand back.

20:07.138 --> 20:09.140
Keep your eye out.

20:11.142 --> 20:13.144
[Alarm]

20:38.586 --> 20:40.588
You wanted
to see me?

20:40.588 --> 20:43.591
Yeah, hi, Clark.
Please, come in.

20:43.591 --> 20:46.594
I've come up with
a brilliant idea.

20:46.594 --> 20:48.095
Oh...really?

20:48.095 --> 20:50.097
Well, daddy thinks
it's brilliant.

20:50.097 --> 20:52.099
You'll write this new series

20:52.099 --> 20:54.101
Called Metropolis after hours.

20:54.101 --> 20:56.103
Who, me? I...

20:56.103 --> 20:58.105
it's wonderful.

20:58.105 --> 21:00.107
It's great,
isn't it?

21:00.107 --> 21:02.109
I'm not
right for this.

21:02.109 --> 21:04.111
You're perfect
for it.

21:04.111 --> 21:05.112
You're young,

21:05.112 --> 21:07.114
You're single,
you're successful.

21:07.114 --> 21:09.617
I'm usually
in bed by 10:30.

21:09.617 --> 21:12.119
That's just it.
You don't flaunt it.

21:12.119 --> 21:14.622
You're no slave
to fashion, although...

21:14.622 --> 21:16.624
have you considered
using contacts?

21:17.124 --> 21:19.627
Uh, they, uh,
make my eyes itch.

21:19.627 --> 21:23.631
Listen, i thought we
could do this together.

21:23.631 --> 21:26.133
I know all
the right places.

21:26.133 --> 21:28.636
I belong
to the right clubs.

21:28.636 --> 21:30.638
We'll start tonight
at the metro club.

21:31.138 --> 21:32.139
Oh, tonight?

21:32.139 --> 21:33.641
Yeah. It's a date.

21:33.641 --> 21:35.142
A date?

21:35.142 --> 21:36.143
A date?

21:36.143 --> 21:38.646
Uh, well, it's just
business, actually.

21:38.646 --> 21:42.650
I've got a letter
for superman, care of me.

21:42.650 --> 21:44.652
Superman
gets mail here?

21:44.652 --> 21:47.154
It's probably just
a picture request.

21:47.154 --> 21:48.155
I could look after
it for you, lois.

21:48.656 --> 21:50.658
I think it's more
than a fan letter.

21:50.658 --> 21:52.660
I think you
should read it.

21:52.660 --> 21:56.163
"Dear superman,
my teacher is speaking

21:56.163 --> 21:58.165
"About the president's
speech on the arms race.

21:58.165 --> 22:02.670
"We're all
very unhappy about it,

22:02.670 --> 22:05.172
"And i said
we should get superman

22:05.673 --> 22:07.174
"To rid the world
of nuclear arms

22:07.174 --> 22:10.678
Because only
he could do it."

22:13.180 --> 22:15.683
"Everybody thinks
i'm a space cadet.

22:15.683 --> 22:17.184
"Once you've destroyed
all nuclear missiles,

22:17.184 --> 22:18.185
"They'll see
i was right.

22:18.185 --> 22:19.186
"Superman can make sure

22:19.186 --> 22:20.688
"We don't blow
ourselves up.

22:21.188 --> 22:23.691
"Thanks a lot. I know
you'll come through.

22:23.691 --> 22:25.693
Your friend, Jeremy."

22:25.693 --> 22:26.694
Poor kid.

22:26.694 --> 22:29.196
I'll get back to work.

22:29.196 --> 22:31.198
There's an angle
in this.

22:31.198 --> 22:33.200
An angle?
He's just a kid!

22:33.200 --> 22:35.202
Daddy loves whipping
up campaigns,

22:35.202 --> 22:37.204
And the public
loves it!

22:37.204 --> 22:39.206
Lacy!

22:39.206 --> 22:41.208
We're going to make
this kid a celebrity.

22:41.208 --> 22:43.210
Everybody in the world
will wonder

22:43.210 --> 22:45.713
What superman's
reply is.

22:49.216 --> 22:51.218
Welcome to
Metropolis, Jeremy.

22:51.218 --> 22:52.720
I'm mr. Warfield,

22:53.220 --> 22:54.722
And this is
my daughter lacy.

22:55.222 --> 22:55.723
Hi, Jeremy.

22:56.223 --> 22:57.725
Now come along
and meet the press.

22:57.725 --> 22:58.726
Have a good trip?

22:59.226 --> 23:00.227
Car had a flat.

23:00.227 --> 23:01.729
Oh, i'm sorry
to hear that.

23:01.729 --> 23:05.232
Here, let everybody
get a picture of you.

23:05.232 --> 23:06.233
That's it, everyone.

23:06.233 --> 23:07.234
Jeremy, over here.

23:07.234 --> 23:08.736
What a boy!

23:08.736 --> 23:09.737
Now, come along,

23:09.737 --> 23:13.240
And tell the american public
what you told me.

23:13.741 --> 23:16.744
I said i wish superman
would've said yes!

23:16.744 --> 23:17.745
Did you get that?

23:17.745 --> 23:18.746
Man: no, we didn't.

23:18.746 --> 23:19.747
Say it again...

23:20.247 --> 23:21.248
loudly.

23:21.248 --> 23:24.752
I said i wish superman
would've said yes.

23:32.259 --> 23:34.762
Miss Lane. Miss Lane.

23:34.762 --> 23:36.263
Take a look at this.

23:36.263 --> 23:38.265
Hot off the press.

23:38.265 --> 23:39.767
Oh, my god!

23:39.767 --> 23:42.269
This time, he's
gone too far.

23:42.269 --> 23:44.271
Look, Clark.

23:44.271 --> 23:46.273
Can't wait for
the chief's reaction.

23:46.273 --> 23:49.777
I'm through
taking it lying down!

23:49.777 --> 23:51.779
Anybody wants me,
i'll be downtown!

23:51.779 --> 23:54.281
Chief look
different to you?

23:54.281 --> 23:58.285
He looks like my father
asking for a loan.

23:58.285 --> 24:00.788
I'll make sure
he's all right.

24:00.788 --> 24:01.789
Look, Clark,

24:01.789 --> 24:04.291
There's nothing
we can do about it.

24:04.291 --> 24:06.293
It's superman's
decision now.

24:06.293 --> 24:08.295
I'm sure he'll do
the right thing.

24:46.834 --> 24:50.838
May the elders
watch over you, my son.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.843
Their wisdom
is all that is left

24:55.843 --> 24:58.846
Of a once powerful
and enlightened planet.

25:00.347 --> 25:03.851
You must listen
to them, kalel.

25:05.853 --> 25:07.354
Listen.

25:11.859 --> 25:14.361
I know i'm forbidden
to interfere,

25:14.361 --> 25:16.864
And yet the earth
is threatened

25:16.864 --> 25:19.366
By the same fate
as krypton's.

25:19.366 --> 25:22.369
The earth
is too primitive.

25:22.369 --> 25:24.371
You can flee
to new worlds

25:24.371 --> 25:26.874
Where war is
long forgotten.

25:27.374 --> 25:28.876
If you teach
the earth

25:29.376 --> 25:31.879
To put its fate
in any one man,

25:31.879 --> 25:33.380
Even yourself,

25:33.881 --> 25:36.383
You're teaching them
to be betrayed.

25:39.386 --> 25:40.387
Betrayed.

25:40.888 --> 25:41.889
Betrayed.

25:42.389 --> 25:43.390
Betrayed!

25:43.891 --> 25:45.326
Betrayed!

25:45.326 --> 25:47.445
[Speaking Russian]

25:47.945 --> 25:50.448
And because
the summit has failed,

25:50.948 --> 25:52.450
We have no choice

25:52.950 --> 25:56.454
But to strive
to be second to none

25:56.954 --> 25:59.457
In the nuclear arms race.

25:59.957 --> 26:01.459
To that end,

26:01.959 --> 26:04.962
This administration
has pursued,

26:05.463 --> 26:07.465
And will continue
to pursue...

26:07.965 --> 26:10.468
[Doorbell Buzzes]

26:10.468 --> 26:12.470
Therefore--

26:15.473 --> 26:17.475
Just a minute.

26:20.978 --> 26:21.979
Lois.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.981
There you are!
What happened?

26:24.482 --> 26:25.983
What do you mean?

26:26.484 --> 26:28.986
"Meet me at 6:00 for
the press awards.

26:29.487 --> 26:30.488
Wear something
really nice

26:30.488 --> 26:31.989
And don't be late."

26:32.490 --> 26:34.492
Were we discussing
some other lois?

26:34.992 --> 26:36.494
I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.

26:36.994 --> 26:38.996
Ok, get dressed,
and we'll go.

26:39.497 --> 26:41.999
I'd rather not,
if you don't mind.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.001
I've got thinking to do,

26:44.502 --> 26:46.504
But you go ahead, ok?

26:49.006 --> 26:50.007
Clark...

26:50.007 --> 26:53.010
something's wrong,
isn't it?

26:54.011 --> 26:55.012
Hmm?

26:56.013 --> 26:58.516
Is there anything
i can do?

26:59.016 --> 27:01.018
Yes, as a matter
of fact.

27:01.519 --> 27:04.021
Could we get
some fresh air?

27:06.023 --> 27:08.025
Fresh air?

27:08.025 --> 27:09.026
Fresh air.

27:09.527 --> 27:12.530
Fresh air! Sure!
Sure, Clark. Sure.

27:12.530 --> 27:14.532
Who needs rubber chicken
and speeches anyway?

27:14.532 --> 27:17.535
Come on, let's get
some fresh air.

27:17.535 --> 27:19.537
Breathe really deep.

27:19.537 --> 27:22.540
Breathe.
Do you feel better?

27:22.540 --> 27:25.543
Clark? Clark! Clark!
Things aren't that bad!

27:25.543 --> 27:28.546
Clark, stop!
Oh, Clark!

27:28.546 --> 27:30.548
Clark! Clark!

27:40.057 --> 27:41.559
Superman!

28:01.078 --> 28:02.580
You ok?

28:02.580 --> 28:03.581
Great.

28:14.091 --> 28:16.594
Hey, look at that.

28:26.604 --> 28:29.607
Ready? There you
go! Bye-Bye!

28:59.136 --> 29:01.138
How'd you like
going solo?

29:01.138 --> 29:02.640
I loved it...

29:02.640 --> 29:05.643
but not as much
as being with you.

29:05.643 --> 29:08.646
I needed to be
with you, too.

29:08.646 --> 29:10.648
You make me laugh.

29:12.149 --> 29:15.152
You're the only one
i can talk to.

29:15.152 --> 29:19.156
Sometimes, i don't know
what i'm supposed to do.

29:19.156 --> 29:21.659
I'm always
here for you.

29:21.659 --> 29:23.160
You know that.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.162
You'll do
the right thing,

29:25.162 --> 29:27.164
No matter
what it is.

29:27.164 --> 29:28.666
You always have.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.167
Thank you.

29:30.167 --> 29:32.169
You know something?

29:32.169 --> 29:33.170
What?

29:33.170 --> 29:35.673
You don't even
know my name.

29:35.673 --> 29:37.174
Kalel.

29:39.176 --> 29:41.178
You remember,
don't you?

29:42.680 --> 29:44.181
I remember
everything.

29:44.181 --> 29:47.685
"Never set one of them
above the rest.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.687
Love all humanity
instead."

29:52.189 --> 29:54.191
That's not fair.

30:20.718 --> 30:21.719
Lois.

30:21.719 --> 30:24.722
Time to go.
We'll be late.

30:24.722 --> 30:26.223
Huh?

30:26.223 --> 30:30.728
What am i doing out here
freezing my butt off?

30:30.728 --> 30:33.731
Oh, you wanted
some fresh air.

30:33.731 --> 30:34.732
That's ok.

30:34.732 --> 30:37.234
I don't want
to catch a cold.

30:37.234 --> 30:39.236
I feel kind of weird.

30:39.236 --> 30:42.740
I feel like
i have jet lag.

30:42.740 --> 30:43.741
Jeepers.

30:43.741 --> 30:45.242
Isn't that crazy?

30:45.242 --> 30:46.243
Yeah.

30:46.243 --> 30:48.746
How about you?
You still down?

30:48.746 --> 30:50.748
Nope. Things are
pretty clear.

30:50.748 --> 30:54.752
Good. Too much thinking
wears down your batteries.

30:56.754 --> 31:00.257
Clark, you got to
go with your gut.

31:00.257 --> 31:01.258
Mmm.

31:01.258 --> 31:02.760
Come on.

31:08.048 --> 31:09.550
Ok, here you go,
Jeremy.

31:10.050 --> 31:12.052
Mr. Warfield
wants shots of you

31:12.553 --> 31:14.054
With lots
of local color.

31:14.555 --> 31:16.557
I can't find
anything special.

31:16.557 --> 31:17.558
Hi, Jeremy.

31:18.058 --> 31:19.560
Superman!

31:19.560 --> 31:20.561
Jimmy.

31:21.061 --> 31:22.563
What a scoop!

31:22.563 --> 31:24.565
Want to take
a walk with me?

31:25.065 --> 31:26.567
Sure! Ok!

31:27.067 --> 31:29.069
Jimmy, come on.

31:42.082 --> 31:44.084
You can't!
You'll get towed!

31:44.585 --> 31:47.588
Do you know what
a ticket costs here?

31:47.588 --> 31:49.590
Lacy, it's only money!

31:58.098 --> 32:00.601
Wait for me upstairs
in the gallery.

32:01.101 --> 32:02.102
Sure. Ok.

32:02.603 --> 32:03.604
Good luck,
superman.

32:04.104 --> 32:05.606
Thanks.

32:13.113 --> 32:16.116
I saved you a seat.

32:17.117 --> 32:18.619
Yay!

32:20.621 --> 32:22.122
All right, superman!

32:24.124 --> 32:26.126
Madame secretary, i don't
represent any country,

32:26.126 --> 32:28.629
But i'd like
to address the delegates.

32:28.629 --> 32:32.633
In that case,
you will need a sponsor.

32:34.134 --> 32:36.637
I believe that will do.

32:36.637 --> 32:37.638
Please.

32:41.642 --> 32:43.143
Thank you.

32:45.145 --> 32:46.647
What's he going to say?

32:46.647 --> 32:49.149
Something wonderful.

32:49.149 --> 32:51.151
Madam secretary,

32:51.151 --> 32:53.654
Honorable delegates,

32:53.654 --> 32:55.656
Ladies and gentlemen.

32:56.156 --> 32:57.658
For many years now,

32:57.658 --> 33:00.661
I've lived among you
as a visitor.

33:00.661 --> 33:03.163
I've seen the beauty
of your many cultures.

33:03.163 --> 33:07.668
I've felt great joy in your
magnificent accomplishments.

33:07.668 --> 33:11.171
I've also seen
the folly of your wars.

33:11.171 --> 33:13.173
As of today, i'm not
a visitor anymore

33:13.173 --> 33:18.178
Because the earth
is my home, too.

33:18.178 --> 33:19.179
We can't live in fear.

33:19.680 --> 33:23.183
I can't stand idly by
and watch us

33:23.183 --> 33:26.687
Stumble into the madness
of possible nuclear destruction.

33:27.187 --> 33:29.189
And so,
i've come to a decision.

33:29.189 --> 33:33.193
I'll do what our governments
haven't done.

33:33.193 --> 33:34.695
Effective immediately,

33:34.695 --> 33:38.198
I'll rid our planet
of all nuclear weapons.

33:38.198 --> 33:40.200
Yay!
Yay!

33:40.200 --> 33:43.203
Yay, superman.

33:45.205 --> 33:47.207

Oh! Hello!

35:59.673 --> 36:01.675
Nice to see you guys!

36:04.177 --> 36:06.680
Why don't you
just relax there?

36:06.680 --> 36:09.182
I'll get on with
the introductions.

36:20.694 --> 36:22.696
From america's
top think tank

36:23.196 --> 36:25.699
And a great warmonger
in his own right.

36:25.699 --> 36:28.201
A hearty bienvenue
to jean pierre dubois,

36:28.702 --> 36:31.705
Nuclear warhead dealer
to the world.

36:32.205 --> 36:33.206
His motto is,

36:33.206 --> 36:36.209
"If you didn't
buy it from jean pierre,

36:36.209 --> 36:39.713
You didn't buy it
on ze black market."

36:39.713 --> 36:41.214
General romoff.

36:41.214 --> 36:45.719
A lot of people think of you
as the mad russian.

36:45.719 --> 36:50.223
I like to think of you
as just madly eccentric.

36:50.223 --> 36:51.725
Please, be seated.

36:53.727 --> 36:56.730
I know you guys
are overcome with joy

36:56.730 --> 37:00.734
Now that superman
has ended the arms race,

37:00.734 --> 37:03.737
But if we work together,

37:03.737 --> 37:06.239
We can make
the world safe...

37:06.239 --> 37:07.741
for war profits.

37:07.741 --> 37:09.242
Make your point.

37:09.242 --> 37:10.744

37:10.744 --> 37:13.747
The greatest criminal mind
of the modern era,

37:13.747 --> 37:15.248
Have discovered a way
to destroy superman.

37:15.749 --> 37:18.752
Behold,
my unscrupulous friends.

37:20.754 --> 37:22.756
Shut those blinds!

37:22.756 --> 37:25.258
The sun is
hurting my eyes!

37:25.258 --> 37:28.261
Exactly.
You know what the sun is?

37:28.261 --> 37:30.263
It's a huge nuclear bomb

37:30.263 --> 37:32.766
With so much
radiation in it,

37:32.766 --> 37:35.769
It could incinerate
the average man like that!

37:35.769 --> 37:39.773
Yes, but superman
is no average man.

37:39.773 --> 37:41.274
Aha! Right.

37:42.776 --> 37:44.277
What is your plan?

37:44.277 --> 37:48.782
Boys, old lex here has
kind of a secret recipe,

37:48.782 --> 37:52.786
A genetic stew
in this dish, if you will.

37:52.786 --> 37:56.790
If you'll put this
on one of your missiles,

37:56.790 --> 38:01.294
Superman will have the biggest
surprise of his life.

38:01.294 --> 38:04.297
I'll introduce him
to his first nightmare--

38:04.798 --> 38:06.299
A nuclear man.

38:06.299 --> 38:07.300
He'll pierce his skin.

38:07.300 --> 38:09.803
He'll make him mortal.
He'll become sick.

38:09.803 --> 38:12.806
We'll dance on his grave.

38:12.806 --> 38:16.810
Why should we deal
with a scoundrel like you?

38:16.810 --> 38:18.311
Remember my motto,

38:18.311 --> 38:20.814
"The more fear you make,
the more loot you take,"

38:21.314 --> 38:23.316
And the more missiles
you guys sell.

38:23.316 --> 38:27.320
Yes,
but what's in it for you?

38:28.822 --> 38:30.824
A tiny commission.

38:31.825 --> 38:33.827
Something appropriate.

38:35.328 --> 38:36.830
A number...

38:36.830 --> 38:39.833
with a lot of zeros
behind it.

01:06:13.285 --> 01:06:15.287
Didn't we have
our little talk

01:06:15.287 --> 01:06:16.788
About personal
involvement

01:06:16.788 --> 01:06:17.789
With the help?

01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:19.791
Now that you're
the publisher--

01:06:20.292 --> 01:06:21.293
Daddy...

01:06:21.293 --> 01:06:22.294
yes, darling?

01:06:22.294 --> 01:06:23.295
Stuff it!

01:06:25.797 --> 01:06:27.799
Lois?
Lois, i'm sorry.

01:06:27.799 --> 01:06:31.803
I promise you i had
nothing to do with that.

01:06:37.809 --> 01:06:39.811
Have you heard
from Clark?

01:06:43.815 --> 01:06:45.317
No.

01:06:51.823 --> 01:06:53.825
[Knock On Door]

01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:11.343
Just a minute.

01:07:11.343 --> 01:07:14.346
Oh, lois. What are
you doing here?

01:07:14.346 --> 01:07:16.348
I knew it.

01:07:16.348 --> 01:07:17.349
Oh, i've just,

01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:19.351
Uh...just got
a really bad flu.

01:07:19.351 --> 01:07:20.352
What do you mean
you knew it?

01:07:20.352 --> 01:07:21.853
How'd you know?

01:07:24.356 --> 01:07:25.357
You haven't been to work.

01:07:25.357 --> 01:07:27.359
You haven't called
the office.

01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:28.860
You haven't even
calledmeback.

01:07:29.361 --> 01:07:31.363
How could you not
callmeback?

01:07:33.865 --> 01:07:35.867
Whatever it is,

01:07:35.867 --> 01:07:37.869
I guess you've
got your reasons,

01:07:37.869 --> 01:07:42.374
But i knew you
were here, you know?

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:44.876
Somehow...

01:07:44.876 --> 01:07:46.878
somehow something
pulled me here.

01:07:46.878 --> 01:07:49.881
I always know when
superman's in trouble.

01:07:49.881 --> 01:07:52.884
Ha ha! Superman?
Something's happened to him?

01:07:53.385 --> 01:07:55.387
Everybody's saying
he's dead, but...

01:07:55.387 --> 01:07:58.390
it can't be true.
I just know it.

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:00.892
I feel it in my heart.

01:08:00.892 --> 01:08:03.395
I think
he just needs help.

01:08:03.395 --> 01:08:07.399
Well, wherever he is, lois,
i'm sure he'll manage.

01:08:07.399 --> 01:08:10.402
Well, if he can't...

01:08:10.402 --> 01:08:12.404
manage...

01:08:12.404 --> 01:08:14.906
and he really is...
in trouble,

01:08:14.906 --> 01:08:16.408
Then there's, uh...

01:08:16.408 --> 01:08:19.911
there's a few things
i'd like to tell him.

01:08:21.912 --> 01:08:23.915
I'd tell him...

01:08:23.915 --> 01:08:27.419
that i will always
cherish the time

01:08:27.419 --> 01:08:29.421
We spent together,

01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:32.424
And i never expected
anything in return

01:08:32.424 --> 01:08:36.428
And no matter how few
minutes i saw him for,

01:08:36.428 --> 01:08:38.430
It always made me happy.

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:42.934
And i would tell him...
that i love him,

01:08:42.934 --> 01:08:46.438
And that
i'll always love him,

01:08:46.438 --> 01:08:48.939
And that...whatever...

01:08:49.441 --> 01:08:51.443
happens to the world, i...

01:08:51.443 --> 01:08:53.444
i know that...

01:08:53.444 --> 01:08:57.948
that he's doing his best
to make sure

01:08:57.948 --> 01:09:00.452
That it'll be all right
for the rest of us.

01:09:00.452 --> 01:09:02.953
Well, wherever he is,
lois,

01:09:02.953 --> 01:09:04.956
I know that...

01:09:04.956 --> 01:09:07.459
he would want
to thank you.

01:09:13.465 --> 01:09:15.466
Listen, i'm, um...

01:09:15.466 --> 01:09:16.968
i'm pretty tired,
you know,

01:09:17.469 --> 01:09:19.470
So i think i'll
just rest here

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:20.971
For a while, ok?

01:09:20.971 --> 01:09:24.475
I'll be fine.
It's ok.

01:09:24.975 --> 01:09:25.977
Please?

01:09:28.979 --> 01:09:30.982
Well, i hope you
feel better, Clark.

01:09:41.993 --> 01:09:44.996

see him,

01:09:44.996 --> 01:09:47.999
Um...or--Or--Or
hear from him,

01:09:47.999 --> 01:09:51.502
He might need this.

01:09:58.443 --> 01:10:01.096
Oh, lex,
we're all very pleased

01:10:01.096 --> 01:10:06.601
At all the nuclear missiles
and arms you've helped us sell,

01:10:06.601 --> 01:10:10.605
And, uh, we've decided
to increase your commission.

01:10:10.605 --> 01:10:14.109
Oh, guys, really,
that's great.

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:16.611
It's the least
we could do.

01:10:16.611 --> 01:10:18.613
Well, i have
another idea.

01:10:18.613 --> 01:10:21.616
Gentlemen, i've decided

01:10:21.616 --> 01:10:24.119
To assume control
of the company.

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:34.629
My first official act
is to say, "you're fired!"

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:38.133
You're mad.

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:41.136
Oh, really?
Look at this.

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:52.147
If you want
a reference for work,

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:54.149
Forget it!

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:59.154
That was a good bit.

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:01.656

with my brains

01:11:01.656 --> 01:11:05.160
And your...
frankly, your brawn,

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.163
The possibilities
are absolutely staggering.

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:10.665
I could be president,
emperor, king.

01:11:10.665 --> 01:11:13.668
Did you see how scared
those guys were?

01:11:13.668 --> 01:11:16.171
And what
do you fear?

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:18.173
What? Now?

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:20.675
With superman dead,
and you're on my team?

01:11:20.675 --> 01:11:22.677
It's like i'm the coach,

01:11:22.677 --> 01:11:25.180
And you're the best
power forward ever.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.181
What's to fear?

of krypton's energy

01:11:42.697 --> 01:11:44.699
Is yours.

to your new home.

Lacy, that's all
the common man reads.

01:19:24.825 --> 01:19:27.328
We could do with
less sensationalism.

01:19:27.328 --> 01:19:29.830
Less sensational papers
go broke.

01:19:30.331 --> 01:19:31.832
I taught you long ago

01:19:32.333 --> 01:19:34.835
That the business of
newspapers is business.

No, daddy.

Our business
is journalism.

We can't be
so irresponsible.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.341
Otherwise,

01:19:40.841 --> 01:19:42.343
We'll lead everyone
into a disaster.

bring about?

What you're doing,

uh...ahem.

Here comes
mr. Warfield.

01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:53.974
You'd better have
an explanation, white,

01:21:53.974 --> 01:21:56.477
Or you'll talk
to your lawyers from jail.

01:21:56.977 --> 01:21:58.979
You know, i'm not a tycoon.

01:21:58.979 --> 01:22:00.981
I'm just
an old reporter,

01:22:00.981 --> 01:22:03.984
But i've read enough
in my own newspaper

01:22:03.984 --> 01:22:06.487
About hostile takeovers
of big companies,

01:22:06.487 --> 01:22:08.489
And you, mr. Warfield,

01:22:08.489 --> 01:22:09.990
Must have been
asleep at the wheel,

01:22:10.491 --> 01:22:13.494
Because i convinced
the bankers of this city

01:22:13.494 --> 01:22:15.996
That our daily planet
should be treated

01:22:15.996 --> 01:22:20.000
Like a natural resource,
protected from predators,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.002
So i convinced them
to lend me the money.

01:22:22.002 --> 01:22:24.505
I bought up
the outstanding shares,

01:22:24.505 --> 01:22:29.009
And you, mr. Warfield, are
now a minority shareholder.

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:31.512
Everyone back to work.

01:22:31.512 --> 01:22:33.514

01:22:36.016 --> 01:22:37.017
I'm sorry.

You win some,
you lose some.

01:22:39.019 --> 01:22:42.022
Now, this is what
i call a newspaper.

01:22:42.022 --> 01:22:44.024
Compliments of
the daily planet.

01:22:44.024 --> 01:22:46.026
Have a nice day!

01:22:46.026 --> 01:22:47.528

We're back!

01:22:50.531 --> 01:22:52.533
Hi, everybody.
Am i late?

01:22:52.533 --> 01:22:54.535
Hey, mr. Kent.
No, he's not here yet.

01:22:54.535 --> 01:22:56.036
It must have been
an effort for you

01:22:56.036 --> 01:22:58.038
To drag yourself
out of bed this morning.

01:22:58.038 --> 01:23:00.040
I'm feeling better.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.542
Had a visit from
a good nurse.

01:23:01.542 --> 01:23:03.043
It must have been some
pretty good medicine,

01:23:03.544 --> 01:23:05.045
Because miss Lane said
you were really ill.

01:23:05.546 --> 01:23:07.047
Jimmy, sometimes
all you need

01:23:07.047 --> 01:23:08.048
Is some
loving attention

01:23:08.549 --> 01:23:09.550
From the right
person.

01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:11.051
Glad you're back,
Clark...

01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:12.553
and remember...

01:23:12.553 --> 01:23:14.555
iam covering
superman's press conference.

01:23:14.555 --> 01:23:16.557
You just tape
crowd reactions.

01:23:16.557 --> 01:23:18.559
Reactions, ok.

01:23:18.559 --> 01:23:20.060
Oh, dear.

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.562
Guess i'll need
a tape recorder.

01:23:21.562 --> 01:23:22.563
Be right back.

01:23:22.563 --> 01:23:24.064

01:23:24.064 --> 01:23:27.067
Same old mr. Kent.
He'll never change.

01:23:27.067 --> 01:23:29.069
I hope not.

01:23:29.069 --> 01:23:30.571
Whoo!

01:23:32.573 --> 01:23:36.076
[Applause]

01:23:36.076 --> 01:23:37.578
Hi, superman.

01:23:37.578 --> 01:23:40.080
Lois, good
to see you again.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.082
Good to see you, too.

01:23:42.082 --> 01:23:43.584
Morning, gentlemen.

01:23:43.584 --> 01:23:45.085
Excuse me.

01:23:45.085 --> 01:23:46.587
Thank you.

01:23:46.587 --> 01:23:49.089
We've survived
the threat of war

01:23:49.089 --> 01:23:51.091
And found
a fragile peace.

01:23:51.091 --> 01:23:54.595
I thought i could give
you freedom from war.

01:23:54.595 --> 01:23:57.598
I was wrong.
It's not mine to give.

01:23:59.099 --> 01:24:01.101
We're still
a young planet.

01:24:01.101 --> 01:24:03.103
There are galaxies
out there,

01:24:03.103 --> 01:24:05.606
Other civilizations
for us to meet,

01:24:05.606 --> 01:24:08.609
To learn from.

01:24:08.609 --> 01:24:11.111
What a brilliant future
we could have.

01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:13.113
And there will be peace

01:24:13.113 --> 01:24:16.116
When the world's people
want it so badly

01:24:16.116 --> 01:24:20.120
That their governments will
have to give it to them.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.625
I wish you could see
the earth as i do.

01:24:24.625 --> 01:24:28.128
When you really see it,
it's just one world.

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:33.467
Think he'll find us?

01:24:33.467 --> 01:24:37.471
Never. We'll lay low
for a while,

01:24:37.471 --> 01:24:38.973
Couple of years.

01:24:38.973 --> 01:24:41.976
I'll come up
with a new plan.

01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:44.979
Whoa. Good thing
i brought my drums.

01:24:51.485 --> 01:24:53.487
[Horn Honks]

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:56.490
Oh, no!

01:24:57.992 --> 01:25:00.494
Uncle lex,
you won't believe this,

01:25:00.494 --> 01:25:01.996
But it's...

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:02.997
Superman.
Superman.

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:04.999
Oh, wow!

01:25:04.999 --> 01:25:06.000
Oh, wow!

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.504
Hey, this rocks! Hey!

01:25:10.504 --> 01:25:12.006
Morning, father.

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.507
Lenny's been under
a bad influence.

01:25:13.507 --> 01:25:14.508
Think you can help him?

01:25:14.508 --> 01:25:16.510
Every boy
can be helped.

01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:18.512
I think you're right.
Good luck, son.

01:25:18.512 --> 01:25:19.513
Come with me,
my friend.

01:25:19.513 --> 01:25:22.016
Do you have
a drum set?

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:25.519
Hey! Mozart's back!

01:25:25.519 --> 01:25:29.523
[Whistling
Eine Kleine Nachtmusik]

01:25:29.523 --> 01:25:31.025
Dwayne,
mozart's back!

01:25:31.025 --> 01:25:33.027
I see him, bubba!

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:35.029
[Whistling]

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:36.530
Shut up!

01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:38.032
[Laughter]

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:39.033
Marshal,
take him away.

01:25:39.033 --> 01:25:40.034
Thank you kindly,
superman.

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.035
Come on, luthor.

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:43.537
One thing--
How'd you beat him?

01:25:43.537 --> 01:25:45.039
High school physics.

01:25:45.539 --> 01:25:47.541
I figured
that if your creature

01:25:47.541 --> 01:25:49.543
Was born from the sun,

01:25:49.543 --> 01:25:51.545
That was
his energy source.

01:25:51.545 --> 01:25:53.047
Will the world
be vaporized?

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:54.548
No, luthor.

01:25:54.548 --> 01:25:56.050
As always,
it's on the brink,

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:58.052
With good fighting evil.

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:59.553
See you in 20.
