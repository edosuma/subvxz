00:56.026 --> 01:01.146
The house was very cold because someone's grandfather had committed suicide there.

01:04.848 --> 01:08.918
One day the grandson came to visit the house ...

01:12.657 --> 01:17.327
the thought that the beautiful girl was an angel.

01:24.362 --> 01:28.132
The grandson worked very hard.

01:32.105 --> 01:35.555
Read, think, drawing, and writing.

01:39.803 --> 01:43.663
He wrote a story just for her.

01:46.801 --> 01:50.241
She was twelve.

01:51.813 --> 01:56.453
His mother and father were friendly, but theirs were evil.

01:58.685 --> 02:03.205
When she grew up, he married her.

02:15.644 --> 02:17.884
- Come on. - You can not marry him.

02:17.946 --> 02:20.776
Why? I love him.

02:20.934 --> 02:23.984
It's rich and famous, and never see you again.

02:24.036 --> 02:27.336
Leave it ... you will come to live in London.

02:27.381 --> 02:31.121
In London Sofia, I finally let the horrible Scotland.

02:31.145 --> 02:33.209
And you will come later.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.643
We'll go to parties conbellos yellow dresses.

02:35.681 --> 02:38.321
And we will dance with musicians, poets and great artists,

02:38.359 --> 02:40.039
We want to paint.

02:40.146 --> 02:42.926
- Really? - Yes, of course.

02:42.946 --> 02:45.716
It will be very exciting. Come on ...

02:45.765 --> 02:48.713
We need more pillows sheets.

02:48.728 --> 02:50.863
Does the mine can be pink?

02:51.302 --> 02:55.562
The nature should guide every stroke of his brush,

02:55.605 --> 02:58.045
only representing it as it really is,

02:58.094 --> 03:01.024
selecting nothing, leaving nothing.

03:01.164 --> 03:03.424
Then they reveal the truth of God.

03:03.443 --> 03:06.323
To be clear, piten what you see,

03:06.360 --> 03:08.870
draw what they see.

03:18.074 --> 03:21.104
Thank God for the gift of marriage.

03:21.143 --> 03:25.243
And we ask the grace of marriage to be enriched.

03:27.180 --> 03:31.160
In the presence of God and these witnesses,

03:31.200 --> 03:34.000
I now pronounce you husband,

03:35.059 --> 03:37.579
and wife.

03:56.010 --> 03:57.640
Friends ...

03:58.581 --> 04:01.651
consider me a man who is not an artist.

04:01.683 --> 04:05.793
But despite this he was awarded a muse.

04:05.836 --> 04:10.806
Consider this man, the luckiest of mortals.

04:10.896 --> 04:15.286
Bound to you in spirit, from now on.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.952
Sofia ... see you in London.

04:23.495 --> 04:24.935
Goodbye.

04:45.031 --> 04:47.901
You know what occurred to me?

04:51.042 --> 04:55.052
It is the first time we're all alone.

05:00.150 --> 05:02.570
Close your eyes.

05:17.011 --> 05:18.841
Perfect.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.777
Here we are, thank Alfred.

06:44.019 --> 06:46.619
Welcome to Denmark Hill.

06:47.090 --> 06:50.090
No ... welcome home.

06:53.077 --> 06:55.597
George, there you are.

06:58.783 --> 07:01.013
This is your new lady.

07:01.089 --> 07:03.989
Do not be shy, take his hand.

07:06.032 --> 07:09.022
For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.

07:10.059 --> 07:12.919
Tell us here.

07:15.862 --> 07:18.742
- Dear ... - Love.

07:19.099 --> 07:21.759
Congratulations, welcome to the family.

07:21.801 --> 07:25.301
- That we're happy to see you here. - Thank You.

07:25.332 --> 07:27.002
I hope the trip tolerable.

07:27.053 --> 07:29.953
The train ride was horribly long.

07:30.094 --> 07:32.974
But all was well when we take his carriage.

07:33.013 --> 07:36.973
That coach is very comfortable, the best the market.

07:37.014 --> 07:39.014
- It's like a feather bed. - Come, spend ...

07:39.049 --> 07:40.719
John...

07:41.059 --> 07:43.979
Ms. Raskins is giving him a bath.

07:44.020 --> 07:46.980
It was crazy to get their hands on.

07:47.013 --> 07:48.803
I must change.

07:48.875 --> 07:52.455
Yeah right ... but no time for that.

07:53.003 --> 07:55.903
Come see this.

07:57.039 --> 08:01.979
This was painted in celebration of their nuptials.

08:03.078 --> 08:06.978
John's writing has made Mr. Turner someone very celebrated.

08:07.083 --> 08:10.903
This painting is already worth more.

08:21.785 --> 08:24.945
Bless us all and Keep us from evil.

08:25.062 --> 08:28.962
Lead us and guide us in our day, and thank God,

08:29.066 --> 08:32.706
to return the treasure of my house safe.

08:33.070 --> 08:35.330
- Amen. - Amen.

08:40.577 --> 08:43.517
I hope you have recovered well, Ms. Ruskins,

08:43.534 --> 08:45.605
miss her at the wedding.

08:45.646 --> 08:51.305
- It was a shame that you were not. - No matter, it happened now.

08:53.504 --> 08:56.904
You look a little thinner than dear last year.

08:57.051 --> 09:01.561
I've been sick, my father's difficulties have affected us all.

09:02.002 --> 09:03.822
That's all over ...

09:04.008 --> 09:06.628
You never need money again.

09:07.002 --> 09:11.482
You however, my boy, I see wider than when you left.

09:11.523 --> 09:13.023
The air of Scotland made you well.

09:13.109 --> 09:14.939
Nonsense, there may be fine in Scotland.

09:15.078 --> 09:16.948
The cough will last all winter.

09:17.033 --> 09:19.623
I'm much better ...

09:19.933 --> 09:21.523
harder.

09:23.919 --> 09:25.949
I'll start painting again.

09:26.089 --> 09:30.419
John drew me constantly, had to spend a fortune on pencil and paper.

09:30.766 --> 09:33.756
Who would not with such a model?

09:36.901 --> 09:40.921
For you, dear, as a welcome gift.

09:42.943 --> 09:45.903
It is one of my favorite pieces.

09:46.380 --> 09:51.312
You better have it now happen to you when you die anyway.

10:05.048 --> 10:06.888
Let her ...

10:09.008 --> 10:11.778
You know how mothers are.

12:22.023 --> 12:26.103
Good morning, ma'am. I hope you slept.

12:26.942 --> 12:28.762
What do you want?

12:28.908 --> 12:31.013
Already all breakfasted?

12:31.327 --> 12:35.857
Yes ma'am, at 7:00. Each morning.

12:36.115 --> 12:37.975
I was not told.

12:38.944 --> 12:41.994
I was so tired I did not hear John.

12:42.030 --> 12:44.970
Lady ¿eggs should not worry?

12:45.003 --> 12:49.883
- Thank you ... Oh, Anna. - Yes, ma'am.

12:50.052 --> 12:54.052
Do you know where John ... Mr. Raskins?

12:55.352 --> 12:57.052
It is working.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.410
Effie.

14:03.940 --> 14:05.210
John.

14:07.940 --> 14:11.510
I knew that here was to be where you work ...

14:12.953 --> 14:15.923
I ... I'm sorry, I broke it.

14:16.357 --> 14:18.377
I see, no matter.

14:23.026 --> 14:24.546
Did you sleep?

14:26.826 --> 14:28.746
I think so ...

14:29.529 --> 14:31.009
te vi.

14:31.056 --> 14:34.026
Can not sleep? you were so tired.

14:34.069 --> 14:36.949
Yes, after a while.

14:40.097 --> 14:44.277
What We Do What do married people?

14:45.803 --> 14:47.923
Be as little as you.

14:48.009 --> 14:50.959
But I think it should work.

15:09.896 --> 15:12.796
I sit here reading.

15:13.007 --> 15:15.877
Honey, aburrirás you.

15:16.826 --> 15:21.476
Why do not you find my mom? I think that needs help in the garden.

15:32.922 --> 15:35.982
- Good Morning. - Good morning, my daughter.

15:36.925 --> 15:41.285
- I hope you slept. - Fine thanks.

15:43.928 --> 15:48.158
- Have breakfast? - Yes, thank you.

15:48.504 --> 15:50.804
John said he needed help.

15:50.824 --> 15:53.994
Me? No, do not let anyone touch my roses ...

15:54.014 --> 15:55.304
John knows.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.015
Then I'm going to help John.

16:03.054 --> 16:06.874
- Help you? - With their work.

16:06.924 --> 16:10.064
You can not help you with your work.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.473
I can take notes, sharpen your pencils ...

16:14.913 --> 16:19.673
Dear ... you married an amazing man.

16:21.915 --> 16:26.585
And the best, the only way you can help,

16:26.817 --> 16:29.137
is leaving him alone.

16:29.814 --> 16:34.254
Leave it alone? But, just got married.

16:35.045 --> 16:38.175
John can work undisturbed,

16:38.208 --> 16:42.008
is the best chance we have to establish his name.

16:42.030 --> 16:46.560
And of course you intend the best social position, right?

16:47.803 --> 16:50.333
So what do I do?

16:50.972 --> 16:55.252
I feel good with my roses, and my bible.

17:07.954 --> 17:11.983
Lord, I believe that this young man is the most critical period of his career.

17:12.021 --> 17:15.972
In a turning point which may sink,

17:16.016 --> 17:19.976
into nothingness, or to rise to great heights.

17:20.027 --> 17:24.146
His way will depend on the nature of the criticism that his work,

17:24.178 --> 17:26.117
will have to sustain.

17:28.015 --> 17:29.988
Do not be late.

17:30.012 --> 17:33.982
Marriage child is learning to wait.

17:35.006 --> 17:37.026
She is ready.

17:55.035 --> 17:57.845
I think you should say something.

18:32.014 --> 18:34.980
I find the truth,

18:35.015 --> 18:39.962
and simplicity of a bygone era,

18:40.005 --> 18:44.655
I think integrity is lost now.

18:53.013 --> 18:56.983
In this dispute can not and will not be permitted.

18:57.025 --> 19:02.715
No place, sir, for these offensive and distorted productions,

19:02.758 --> 19:06.038
in the sacred walls of this great institution.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.949
Gentlemen, please.

19:08.044 --> 19:12.504
That discussion so interesting can continue on the table.

19:26.198 --> 19:32.446
I say it depends on you as president of the Academy,

19:32.472 --> 19:36.684
protect us from this horrible confusion.

19:36.712 --> 19:40.752
Remove the paintings before the opening, I implore you.

19:40.788 --> 19:44.788
Do not give in, they are nothing more than childish things and amateurs.

19:44.814 --> 19:48.734
Remove them, are a disgrace to these walls.

19:48.751 --> 19:51.160
Gentlemen, please, please ...

19:51.199 --> 19:52.489
Thank You.

19:52.736 --> 19:56.036
What is the purpose of art ...?

20:00.238 --> 20:03.930
What is the purpose of art?

20:03.975 --> 20:06.985
¿Idealize, sentimentalize?

20:07.012 --> 20:08.968
No, of course not,

20:08.987 --> 20:13.114
the purpose of art is to reveal the truth.

20:13.248 --> 20:15.878
God's purpose is to reveal God.

20:15.896 --> 20:18.046
But not in cartoons.

20:18.087 --> 20:19.777
Neither ugliness.

20:19.803 --> 20:23.023
- Let him speak. - Listen to what he has to say.

20:23.051 --> 20:26.030
If God is the creator of nature,

20:26.055 --> 20:28.045
intone also the creator of decomposition,

20:28.074 --> 20:31.154
disease, ugliness.

20:31.737 --> 20:34.007
Proffers not deny that Mr. Hansilvya,

20:34.085 --> 20:39.205
is not the person from whom someone might fall in love,

20:39.340 --> 20:42.670
but faithfulness, honesty,

20:42.701 --> 20:47.051
these things are more important than mere conventional beauty.

20:47.095 --> 20:49.855
Do you understand? He was painting what he saw.

20:49.920 --> 20:54.970
But what you see, Mr. Raskins? Tell us.

20:55.549 --> 21:01.869
I see nothing less than eternal truth ... I see God.

21:03.506 --> 21:08.006
In these visionaries,

21:08.217 --> 21:13.577
I see a noble art school, which the world has produced in 300 years.

21:13.822 --> 21:15.692
It's ridiculous.

21:15.996 --> 21:19.786
- Son imitators. - Medieval copies.

21:20.032 --> 21:21.912
Sr. Raskins,

21:23.470 --> 21:27.690
Do you think that painting pleases God?

21:29.958 --> 21:35.028
Every great work of art, is pleased.

21:38.977 --> 21:43.997
If its nature is pleased, then we follow.

21:45.888 --> 21:50.288
I must confess that this seems empty.

21:50.430 --> 21:53.820
Well done dear, it was an interesting question,

21:53.866 --> 21:55.946
and bravely said.

21:55.971 --> 22:00.241
Do not worry about God, to think of their dogs.

22:01.529 --> 22:06.719
I do not know what I think, just like me,

22:07.066 --> 22:08.876
make me feel happy.

22:08.953 --> 22:13.543
I do not remember the last time I felt happy in this place.

22:13.880 --> 22:17.880
Horrible collection of men self halagándose,

22:17.978 --> 22:21.848
was a relief to hear an intelligent female voice.

22:21.890 --> 22:24.220
It is a pleasure ... I'm Eff ...

22:24.508 --> 22:26.698
that is, the Mrs. John Raskins.

22:26.729 --> 22:30.899
Be who you are, but who you were when you were a Mrs. John Raskins?

22:30.940 --> 22:32.910
I'm Elizabeth.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.402
My name Eff ... Eufemia.

22:35.738 --> 22:38.028
It is somewhat sad to lose your name,

22:38.038 --> 22:41.458
and taking the Christian name of your husband that.

22:41.474 --> 22:44.884
- Fortunately I do not have that cross. - Why?

22:44.944 --> 22:46.954
- Lady Eastlake. - Thank You.

22:47.014 --> 22:49.954
- Her husband is ... - President of the Academy. Yup.

22:49.994 --> 22:53.954
Thank You. Absolutely hates the paintings, by the way.

22:53.984 --> 22:57.954
But respect the opinion of her husband, as his.

22:57.984 --> 23:00.404
Has to invite to dinner.

23:02.225 --> 23:04.355
Well, I'll remember.

23:04.703 --> 23:08.795
- It seems like just fine. - As good as expected.

23:09.887 --> 23:12.917
They agreed to leave the paintings instead.

23:13.858 --> 23:18.358
Lady Eastlake was very friendly, and did not know who I was at first.

23:18.505 --> 23:20.085
¿Lady Eastlake?

23:20.132 --> 23:22.592
John congratulations, you won the fight.

23:22.733 --> 23:24.863
Sure must be proud.

23:24.903 --> 23:30.513
We'll see, it is certain that I will take three days to recover.

23:30.748 --> 23:33.198
Is that asking so much of you,

23:33.948 --> 23:36.498
everyone always want something.

23:42.942 --> 23:44.752
Forgot to say ...

23:47.787 --> 23:51.787
Lady Eastlake asked me to invite them to dinner here.

23:51.903 --> 23:54.998
To have dinner here? Do Eastlake?

24:03.009 --> 24:04.400
John.

24:05.300 --> 24:06.700
Yup.

24:07.844 --> 24:10.024
Are we not poor, no?

24:10.549 --> 24:13.559
Poor, even remotely.

24:14.923 --> 24:16.883
Why do you ask?

24:16.924 --> 24:19.554
Just tell me something.

24:19.895 --> 24:21.595
What?

24:21.831 --> 24:25.881
That we are not so poor as not to have children.

24:25.925 --> 24:28.435
You're still a child.

24:28.602 --> 24:30.132
I am not.

24:31.802 --> 24:34.432
I'm not a girl, I'm a married woman.

24:36.570 --> 24:38.970
I want to live together as husband and wife.

24:39.008 --> 24:41.598
We are husband and wife.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.521
I know, but alone.

24:43.549 --> 24:46.909
I would love to keep the house for you.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.993
Our own house, with a large room for the child.

24:50.031 --> 24:52.996
In the city, to maintain our social life.

24:53.059 --> 24:56.939
I will be in charge of our domestic affairs.

25:00.909 --> 25:03.839
I will become the wife you want.

25:57.604 --> 25:59.624
Can I help you, ma'am?

25:59.703 --> 26:01.623
If Ana, thanks.

26:01.825 --> 26:04.885
Looking needle and thread to shirt John,

26:04.908 --> 26:05.858
I have to fix it.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.688
Sorry lady,

26:07.986 --> 26:10.236
I do not know as I saw it.

26:10.938 --> 26:12.998
Leave it here, I will soon.

26:13.041 --> 26:14.801
I will.

26:14.946 --> 26:18.936
Lady has always been my job to fix things young Raskins.

26:19.074 --> 26:20.749
No longer ...

26:22.174 --> 26:24.049
I am his wife,

26:24.387 --> 26:26.517
I take care of his things.

26:26.959 --> 26:28.599
Thanks Ana.

26:30.889 --> 26:31.889
Since, ma'am.

26:41.899 --> 26:43.459
Honey ...

26:45.768 --> 26:50.468
I am a sewing expert, John will be new shirt.

26:50.822 --> 26:54.882
If my mom needed to fix something, socks, scarves, baby

26:54.944 --> 26:57.574
she always asked me what me.

26:57.968 --> 27:00.538
John does not use handkerchiefs baby.

27:01.996 --> 27:05.296
No, I know, of course not ...

27:05.817 --> 27:08.767
Dear, sure you have a good intention.

27:08.911 --> 27:11.921
But we are not suggesting that we would insult our son,

27:11.943 --> 27:14.013
take old socks.

27:14.949 --> 27:19.539
- Do you forget where you are? - Of course not, forgive me.

27:19.885 --> 27:21.845
You forget who you are?

27:27.055 --> 27:28.435
Home ...

28:22.041 --> 28:23.621
John.

29:27.051 --> 29:30.001
Ms. Raskins says you should take this.

29:31.930 --> 29:33.450
What is it?

29:33.934 --> 29:36.854
A remedy. He says it's the best.

29:36.899 --> 29:41.189
- What's inside? - I do not know, ma'am.

29:44.747 --> 29:47.557
Want poison, will not take it.

29:48.906 --> 29:51.776
Ms. Raskins is very determined.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.112
Lady Eastlake, Sir Charles.

30:25.914 --> 30:27.774
We honor.

30:27.886 --> 30:31.746
I tried unsuccessfully to congratulate his son,

30:31.790 --> 30:33.830
for its magnificent new scripts.

30:33.875 --> 30:36.965
They are not more than a few words no matter who.

30:36.982 --> 30:41.292
Sure John, came to congratulate you on your exciting new wife.

30:41.918 --> 30:44.428
Well, new to me, where is it?

30:47.988 --> 30:51.191
Does the impact much when we met?

30:51.966 --> 30:54.236
- I forgive. - Sure.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.720
Why are not you wearing?

31:05.908 --> 31:08.578
You will arise now wear a garment.

31:08.919 --> 31:10.999
I'm sick, my head hurts.

31:11.020 --> 31:13.530
You're not sick, just annoyed,

31:13.553 --> 31:16.623
you took the medicine, arise.

31:16.966 --> 31:19.416
It will be dressed up and down in five minutes,

31:19.433 --> 31:21.963
or there will be consequences.

31:38.905 --> 31:40.685
There you are.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.875
Honey, what's wrong?

31:44.921 --> 31:46.621
You're as white as teeth.

31:46.968 --> 31:48.808
No, I'm fine.

31:51.905 --> 31:53.475
Sit.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.865
Sir Charles told us about the excellent response,

31:58.888 --> 32:00.798
the new book of John.

32:00.937 --> 32:02.737
Eufemia, a drink.

32:02.881 --> 32:05.951
As I said, the reaction has been sobrecojedora,

32:05.981 --> 32:08.801
tell the grand master of our time.

32:08.844 --> 32:11.864
Charles Forgive me, but this girl,

32:11.885 --> 32:14.895
tiunfos not need to hear her husband.

32:14.942 --> 32:18.592
Now you need is a cup of tea and bed.

32:18.636 --> 32:20.406
Does that feel?

32:20.447 --> 32:22.717
Dear, are you still sick?

32:30.846 --> 32:32.406
Forgive me ...

32:32.604 --> 32:34.624
Friend, friend ...

32:43.790 --> 32:45.984
Excuse my condition, I'm sorry.

32:46.945 --> 32:49.455
He is married life.

32:50.995 --> 32:55.355
Effi, do you have anyone with whom you speak?

32:57.901 --> 33:01.841
No I keep thinking I made a terrible mistake.

33:03.980 --> 33:07.920
That also thought early in my marriage.

33:08.909 --> 33:11.592
The beginnings are difficult.

33:11.958 --> 33:14.528
But we have not yet begun.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.848
Do not leave us.

33:16.987 --> 33:19.887
They did not always live here.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.701
It is a temporary fix, sure.

33:22.842 --> 33:25.752
They want it here, I'm sure.

33:25.842 --> 33:28.852
They have always had for them.

33:28.893 --> 33:33.293
Did they not let children play with when he was little?

33:33.766 --> 33:36.746
In college, she lived near him,

33:36.767 --> 33:38.707
and were every day.

33:38.938 --> 33:41.638
She never let him get away.

33:41.998 --> 33:47.688
Dear, it's crazy not having a home.

33:49.627 --> 33:51.747
Thanks for being so kind.

33:51.772 --> 33:56.112
You are a strong and intelligent girl.

33:56.904 --> 34:01.404
But I must tell you to forget that you have made a mistake.

34:01.912 --> 34:03.992
And if the case.

34:04.332 --> 34:08.552
So dear I fear that it is wrong with you have to live.

34:08.571 --> 34:10.561
No turning back.

34:10.996 --> 34:14.587
No ... no, of course not.

34:17.833 --> 34:23.393
Sure, think everything will fall into place naturally.

34:23.928 --> 34:28.938
The children are the glue that bind all marriages.

34:38.981 --> 34:40.731
Can you forgive me?

34:40.967 --> 34:42.447
Of course.

34:42.475 --> 34:46.458
If you bring me back I'll send you to pull the Thames.

35:15.830 --> 35:17.800
Your mother is angry.

35:17.821 --> 35:19.849
There was nothing I could do.

35:19.859 --> 35:23.984
God. We have protected the full force of our body,

35:23.999 --> 35:26.816
from childhood, of all the obstacles,

35:26.831 --> 35:29.697
everything to feed your talent.

35:29.773 --> 35:31.723
And they have succeeded.

35:31.866 --> 35:35.886
But even with so much talent, effort is required.

35:35.918 --> 35:37.928
And for the first time,

35:39.385 --> 35:41.615
President of the Academy,

35:41.870 --> 35:45.870
invited the best anyone could wish for,

35:45.887 --> 35:48.031
gives us his presence,

35:48.274 --> 35:51.854
and your wife could not or would not,

35:51.874 --> 35:55.337
make an effort to be successful.

35:55.363 --> 35:58.323
Many careers have fallen for less.

35:58.656 --> 36:01.866
Sorry to be a disappointment to you.

36:09.963 --> 36:14.953
We warn you about this girl, but decided to go your own way.

36:14.989 --> 36:17.369
Up to you to ensure this,

36:17.398 --> 36:21.998
not lead to the destruction of, all you have desired for you.

36:29.754 --> 36:33.294
You are sad, did not want a coffee, right?

36:33.565 --> 36:35.735
No, no, it was just ...

36:35.976 --> 36:38.706
I was interested to see that poor girl.

36:39.748 --> 36:43.918
- And she's not happy. - You did not at first.

36:43.958 --> 36:45.978
That's what I said.

36:46.017 --> 36:48.017
- You were very sad. - And you pompous.

36:48.054 --> 36:52.074
- It's true. - And distant.

36:53.814 --> 36:57.224
This is more complicated,

36:57.398 --> 37:02.388
somehow have to get him away from his clutches.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.917
You make them sound like dragons in a fairy tale.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.918
Yup? It was not my intention.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.360
Maybe not so far from the truth.

37:11.398 --> 37:14.578
What was it you said about Venice?

37:14.852 --> 37:17.492
Well, I hope you do not take your parents.

37:47.278 --> 37:48.578
John...

37:50.191 --> 37:53.110
Thanks for bringing us here.

38:10.414 --> 38:15.754
Lady Eastlake told me reponderíamos before her.

38:15.792 --> 38:19.832
- We must take care. - Exactly.

38:19.870 --> 38:24.450
- Thank you, thank you very much. - That's very kind.

38:24.831 --> 38:29.981
For all, it is not often that we have new blood here.

38:30.012 --> 38:32.385
I'm sending notes,

38:33.340 --> 38:36.920
will make you invitations to all parties.

38:37.601 --> 38:41.901
I see you do not like parties.

38:41.938 --> 38:46.638
I came to Venice to work, to write a new book.

38:46.778 --> 38:52.858
I hate the holidays, in fact I can not go without it affecting me.

38:53.898 --> 38:56.818
My wife will go in my place.

38:57.783 --> 38:59.243
Say what?

38:59.805 --> 39:02.989
He says he hates the holidays and do not want to see anyone.

39:03.012 --> 39:05.032
But she can.

39:05.050 --> 39:06.970
Did you bring a chaperone?

39:07.005 --> 39:08.960
No, we have not.

39:08.997 --> 39:13.787
My wife is the same model of decorum.

39:13.827 --> 39:16.067
Do not worry, Mr. Raskins.

39:16.083 --> 39:20.067
Venetian language so quick to gossip will be silenced.

39:20.092 --> 39:23.032
With your permission my mother and I will of chaperones.

39:23.073 --> 39:24.453
Perfect.

39:24.951 --> 39:28.641
What? What say all?

39:28.804 --> 39:33.454
That her husband does not approve pleasure, but you will.

39:48.289 --> 39:50.919
How would "like to buy some cheese".

39:50.989 --> 39:53.219
I would like to buy some cheese.

39:53.389 --> 39:55.919
I would like to buy some cheese.

39:55.997 --> 39:57.987
- Bravo. - Magnificent.

39:58.968 --> 40:01.748
His accent is divine, say it again.

40:01.889 --> 40:03.919
I would like to buy some cheese.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.881
Again, again ...

40:05.989 --> 40:08.419
I would like to buy some cheese.

40:08.951 --> 40:11.201
It is wonderful mom.

40:15.989 --> 40:18.019
Now, he asked nine cents.

40:18.542 --> 40:22.612
Please give these coins, and say that money is no problem for you,

40:22.633 --> 40:25.793
since these married to the most wealthy and generous man Venice.

40:26.503 --> 40:27.723
Thank You.

40:27.933 --> 40:30.793
Rafael, please she gave him too.

40:31.933 --> 40:33.493
Now.

40:33.833 --> 40:35.293
It's better.

41:01.088 --> 41:02.388
Top ...

41:18.390 --> 41:21.998
Neither one eye up to this splendor.

41:25.893 --> 41:27.593
Look at this.

41:28.330 --> 41:32.510
It is as if the wind had carved it.

41:33.049 --> 41:34.789
That soft ...

41:34.947 --> 41:38.687
And that is completely different from this.

41:40.725 --> 41:44.945
- The variety is great, right? - Yup.

41:44.994 --> 41:48.454
Look down there, what do you see?

41:50.833 --> 41:52.863
It is very beautiful,

41:53.003 --> 41:55.173
but regularly,

41:55.373 --> 41:57.843
unified way.

41:58.685 --> 42:02.945
It's like a world where trees are all the same size.

42:02.980 --> 42:06.140
And the clouds same, and people say that,

42:06.171 --> 42:08.561
again and again.

42:08.766 --> 42:13.346
It is made perfectly, but entirely private,

42:13.372 --> 42:17.232
of these beautiful imperfections.

42:19.732 --> 42:22.442
Imperfections are your ideal,

42:22.601 --> 42:25.861
then you should find very beautiful.

43:35.262 --> 43:37.232
Look what I found.

43:42.722 --> 43:45.432
From half a lifetime ago.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.330
Do you remember?

43:55.539 --> 43:59.079
Why is turning into a tree?

43:59.532 --> 44:01.972
She is the nymph Daphne.

44:03.043 --> 44:05.693
He is the god Apollo.

44:05.831 --> 44:10.611
He wants a sobrecojedor desire, want to own their purity,

44:11.849 --> 44:15.089
But she does not want him.

44:15.637 --> 44:19.947
And then it turns into a laurel to choose.

44:19.995 --> 44:22.035
It is a clever trick.

44:22.218 --> 44:25.318
It is, nymphs are very intelligent.

44:59.718 --> 45:01.718
What are you doing?

45:01.738 --> 45:03.718
Leave, leave ...

45:05.038 --> 45:08.008
Care, a woman drowned in the canal last month.

45:08.023 --> 45:12.043
Hear! Who hired this spirit of Christmas?

45:12.070 --> 45:14.910
Look at her, is making an effort.

45:14.925 --> 45:17.155
It is much more difficult than it looks.

45:17.172 --> 45:18.432
Say what?

45:18.467 --> 45:23.017
He says it's very easy, what for to pay for a gondolier?

45:23.061 --> 45:24.431
Help me ...

45:24.471 --> 45:26.961
No, no, and do better.

45:49.032 --> 45:52.932
- You're still working. - Sure.

45:53.076 --> 45:56.896
- Did you enjoy dancing? - Yup.

45:57.036 --> 45:59.066
Y Ballet ballet.

45:59.099 --> 46:01.509
If you you bloom, I'll die.

46:11.029 --> 46:13.339
What will your book?

46:16.773 --> 46:20.093
Say that Venice was once,

46:20.133 --> 46:23.863
the most glorious, true,

46:24.001 --> 46:26.761
most persecuted pearl.

46:27.004 --> 46:30.074
As Eve from Adam, but now,

46:30.097 --> 46:32.077
has fallen from the grace.

46:32.084 --> 46:36.674
Dissipation and corruption is almost complete.

46:38.811 --> 46:40.811
What do you mean?

46:42.055 --> 46:46.975
It once was a virgin, and is now a prostitute,

46:47.525 --> 46:51.975
addicted nothing but pleasure and pleasure.

46:52.052 --> 46:54.152
A beautiful prostitute,

46:54.207 --> 46:57.577
but a prostitute anyway.

48:03.901 --> 48:05.249
Be Quiet.

48:05.259 --> 48:07.279
We are sleeping here.

48:08.070 --> 48:09.910
Leave them alone.

48:10.955 --> 48:13.015
You were once young too.

48:13.039 --> 48:15.059
Those two are not husband and wife.

48:15.079 --> 48:18.059
She is the wife of English.

48:18.074 --> 48:19.734
Does the crazy?

48:19.946 --> 48:23.516
See that? They talk about us.

48:23.664 --> 48:26.534
I call them "whisperers".

48:29.967 --> 48:32.737
Our dance is big news.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.042
I hope your husband is ready.

48:37.089 --> 48:42.459
My husband does not hear murmurs, is well above that.

48:42.543 --> 48:46.073
And I never forget my duty to him, even for a moment.

48:46.211 --> 48:50.581
Anyway I have no talent for intrigue.

49:03.804 --> 49:07.077
Want to try? There's nobody here.

49:07.110 --> 49:08.600
Can I?

49:08.628 --> 49:12.038
- Sure. - I'd love to.

49:19.688 --> 49:21.738
No, the hand well.

49:39.017 --> 49:41.047
No, no no ...

49:43.052 --> 49:45.752
- No, stop. - Kiss Me.

50:10.020 --> 50:11.170
Wait.

50:22.912 --> 50:24.352
Effy.

51:33.933 --> 51:35.903
Already back?

51:36.008 --> 51:38.628
Yeah ... I was tired.

51:40.934 --> 51:45.374
- Why do not you sleep? - That I will.

52:50.901 --> 52:55.226
Mr. Raskins, you know what I had that treating your mother?

52:56.970 --> 53:00.910
I do not know, but she says it's miraculous.

53:00.969 --> 53:05.159
Well ... I do not think it's a normal treatment ...

53:06.989 --> 53:08.649
in this case.

53:13.915 --> 53:16.945
How long have you sick?

53:16.984 --> 53:18.894
Almost constantly,

53:19.025 --> 53:23.545
one intermiable succession of minor ailments.

53:23.988 --> 53:28.668
This particular, it came a few months ago.

53:29.607 --> 53:32.397
How did manisfestó?

53:32.943 --> 53:35.103
Hysteria, hallucinations,

53:36.608 --> 53:38.498
in his person.

53:38.531 --> 53:40.011
Like what?

53:40.027 --> 53:42.977
Mere fantasies of an uncontrolled brain ...

53:42.990 --> 53:45.610
So ... how are they?

53:46.947 --> 53:49.997
Organic matter ... bark ...

53:50.908 --> 53:53.768
- Tree bark? - Yes, sir.

53:53.909 --> 53:55.959
It is interesting.

53:56.930 --> 54:00.009
Definitely his nervous condition,

54:00.023 --> 54:02.690
by hair loss.

54:02.974 --> 54:07.124
- Hair Loss? - Have not you noticed?

54:07.960 --> 54:09.250
Here ...

54:11.948 --> 54:13.748
and here.

54:17.936 --> 54:19.846
I recommend the following,

54:19.870 --> 54:23.991
fresh air, exercise, a healthy environment,

54:24.020 --> 54:28.793
perhaps far from the influence of Mrs. Raskins, most.

54:28.922 --> 54:32.622
She is Scottish by birth, right?

54:33.929 --> 54:38.579
Maybe some time in their homeland your convenience.

54:39.722 --> 54:43.902
I prescribiré, iron tonic for her.

54:43.958 --> 54:47.088
- And for you. - No I have mada bad.

54:47.108 --> 54:51.858
For you I prescribiré, sharper eyes and ears more.

54:52.995 --> 54:57.735
In my opinion, his wife is not bad,

54:57.772 --> 55:02.012
a little love and attention would not cure.

56:45.955 --> 56:47.565
What are you looking?

56:48.915 --> 56:50.335
Nothing.

56:52.975 --> 56:55.085
What do you think then?

56:58.828 --> 57:01.098
Many great things.

57:06.938 --> 57:08.378
Bailes,

57:09.922 --> 57:11.152
emotions.

57:14.991 --> 57:17.011
And many other things.

58:23.615 --> 58:25.835
Mr. Milais ... hello.

58:25.855 --> 58:29.865
I have not been here for long, okay?

58:29.889 --> 58:33.477
She has to be due to its great success,

58:33.491 --> 58:35.776
by which I warmly congratulate.

58:35.793 --> 58:37.223
Thank you very much, ma'am.

58:37.243 --> 58:39.828
- I am motivated ... - And painting.

58:39.854 --> 58:42.014
Yes, in fact I have been hired recently.

58:42.031 --> 58:45.298
- Well, that's good. - It is.

58:45.307 --> 58:48.320
I am proud to say that I paint our champion.

58:48.340 --> 58:50.246
I have to paint Mr. Raskins.

58:50.259 --> 58:52.239
¿When Mr. Raskins? Really?

58:52.254 --> 58:55.834
I can not create it, we go to Scotland soon.

58:56.171 --> 58:57.581
¿Scotland?

58:57.626 --> 59:01.175
- Yes, his wife is from there you know? - Yes, he knew.

59:01.198 --> 59:04.008
- How is she? - Okay ...

59:04.013 --> 59:08.994
I'm not sure, I think we go for the sake of your health.

59:11.936 --> 59:13.276
¿Scotland?

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.310
Ready?

01:00:34.948 --> 01:00:36.318
Damn.

01:00:40.958 --> 01:00:43.578
Fear not brave companions,

01:00:43.918 --> 01:00:46.588
breakfast is in the hands.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.190
- Do not move. - What?

01:00:51.209 --> 01:00:53.490
No, no. Mirame.

01:00:54.725 --> 01:00:58.075
That light ... is what I want.

01:00:59.803 --> 01:01:02.153
I do not will rest in the middle of a Scottish loch.

01:01:02.194 --> 01:01:05.604
That angle, accurate, and water ...

01:01:06.846 --> 01:01:09.766
and exactly that light.

01:01:09.985 --> 01:01:13.335
Excellent, ¿I can put my shoes now?

01:01:13.967 --> 01:01:15.257
Yup ...

01:01:19.903 --> 01:01:22.533
Really, it's good that you came,

01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:24.751
you have no idea.

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:29.949
Maybe you have that thing.

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:33.612
By God,

01:01:34.779 --> 01:01:38.089
if it were not for your confidence in me,

01:01:38.639 --> 01:01:41.979
I would still be hungry.

01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:53.548
- It is essential, Everett. - Thank You.

01:01:54.506 --> 01:01:59.406
You will begin to read it to him, and then continue their study.

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.309
Mr. McFail, thanks.

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.002
Everett.

01:02:10.968 --> 01:02:13.418
That happiness is eternal.

01:02:13.568 --> 01:02:14.818
Thank You.

01:02:26.962 --> 01:02:30.742
Is not as white as expected, but suffice.

01:02:33.974 --> 01:02:38.984
- Shall we? - No, first ...

01:02:57.919 --> 01:03:00.109
Are they bad news?

01:03:01.189 --> 01:03:02.989
Whose?

01:03:06.947 --> 01:03:09.017
My poor mother,

01:03:11.697 --> 01:03:13.907
He lost his son,

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:16.857
the seventh.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:22.400
I do not know as you can with that.

01:03:23.973 --> 01:03:26.273
I'm sorry.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:34.568
I need to start lunch.

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:51.950
How is Effy?

01:03:52.568 --> 01:03:54.658
I think it is improving,

01:03:54.676 --> 01:03:57.406
exercises and the air will feel good.

01:03:57.438 --> 01:04:00.200
I mean what if she recovered from the news?

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.044
What news?

01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:06.489
- The loss of the child. - What child?

01:04:06.638 --> 01:04:10.928
The Mrs. Gray, his mother lost her son.

01:04:11.435 --> 01:04:14.955
Then he lost another, how many are already five?

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:17.980
- Seven. - Seven, by God.

01:04:22.822 --> 01:04:25.232
¿Effy said nothing?

01:04:25.504 --> 01:04:30.704
His mother lost children safe so regularly that she thought it would not affect me.

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:32.988
That's a bit harsh.

01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:34.620
Not at all.

01:04:34.636 --> 01:04:37.916
She is positively like an animal in its procreation,

01:04:37.926 --> 01:04:41.836
so do not know how glad we all survive.

01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:45.952
Watch this exquisite bird.

01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:52.541
You have to be at your best position to capture that.

01:05:02.977 --> 01:05:04.227
What?

01:05:04.381 --> 01:05:07.331
He realizes he can open the window, close the curtain,

01:05:07.352 --> 01:05:09.652
and look without leaving the bed.

01:05:09.835 --> 01:05:12.175
It's like being in a box.

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:15.510
Do you listen to John?

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:18.590
Do we begin early, Everett?

01:05:22.713 --> 01:05:24.203
¿Everett?

01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:27.698
Yes, first thing.

01:05:34.468 --> 01:05:37.838
I can not keep my fingers refuse to bend.

01:05:37.992 --> 01:05:41.812
Come on ... let me help.

01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:45.491
I've done two inches of work.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.800
Where is Everett?

01:06:28.315 --> 01:06:30.905
Right behind me, fell.

01:06:56.003 --> 01:06:57.703
What happened?

01:06:57.938 --> 01:07:00.198
I fell off the boat.

01:07:00.224 --> 01:07:02.184
Let the mirártelo.

01:07:02.207 --> 01:07:04.997
Do not think I have a broken nose.

01:07:11.001 --> 01:07:15.319
- Am I hurting you? - No, I'm fine.

01:07:19.985 --> 01:07:22.975
Why do not you think you have a broken nose?

01:07:23.007 --> 01:07:24.700
What?

01:07:25.969 --> 01:07:28.939
Outside you said you could not have broken the nose.

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:32.079
Oh, really? So silly.

01:07:33.991 --> 01:07:38.981
It's just use my face as a model all the time.

01:07:39.919 --> 01:07:43.009
It is cheaper to pay someone.

01:07:43.528 --> 01:07:47.268
So my nose is very useful.

01:07:51.811 --> 01:07:54.991
And you need to smell things.

01:07:55.899 --> 01:07:58.109
That too, of course.

01:09:46.707 --> 01:09:48.938
Ya ... no more.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:53.451
The trick is knowing when to stop.

01:09:55.056 --> 01:09:56.626
It is exquisite.

01:09:57.926 --> 01:09:59.796
No me tientes.

01:09:59.892 --> 01:10:04.702
Resentirías your talent ... if you were not so angelic.

01:10:15.901 --> 01:10:18.721
Your nose is perfect again.

01:10:19.961 --> 01:10:22.961
Please do not remind me of that.

01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:48.748
Done.

01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:54.246
I am anxious head.

01:11:02.898 --> 01:11:05.528
In truth, she wanted to come.

01:11:07.061 --> 01:11:11.981
Well ... I'll just be away for a few days.

01:11:12.497 --> 01:11:15.217
But you're not eager to leave her alone.

01:11:15.249 --> 01:11:18.023
Why? Where are you going?

01:11:18.045 --> 01:11:21.393
- I'm not going anywhere. - Then you will not be alone.

01:11:21.412 --> 01:11:23.332
You can not leave her alone with me.

01:11:23.356 --> 01:11:26.406
Yes, I realize it's a bore, Everett.

01:11:26.419 --> 01:11:29.084
Not at all, I mean it is wrong.

01:11:29.102 --> 01:11:30.612
By God.

01:11:30.629 --> 01:11:34.549
I will make Ms. McFail stay, if you care about the locals.

01:11:34.567 --> 01:11:36.917
I'm not worried locals.

01:11:37.033 --> 01:11:41.423
John, do not mind at all your wife's reputation.

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:45.820
Leave it completely alone with another man,

01:11:45.863 --> 01:11:48.303
a single man.

01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:03.316
I would have loved this as a child.

01:13:03.632 --> 01:13:06.612
Where I grew up there were mountains.

01:13:07.023 --> 01:13:10.123
- Do you really liked? - Yup.

01:13:12.959 --> 01:13:15.609
See that bush with thorns?

01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:20.901
My mother had fairies under the trees, told me.

01:13:20.948 --> 01:13:25.558
I believed him absolutely, had breakfast and brought him something.

01:13:26.499 --> 01:13:29.999
And of course, in the morning it was always eaten by a fox,

01:13:30.012 --> 01:13:34.412
.. Or something, only further proved its existence.

01:13:34.847 --> 01:13:37.907
One Christmas my mom prepared a ham.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.870
I thought that fairies are deserved.

01:13:40.902 --> 01:13:44.902
I went to the pantry to cut a slice and could not.

01:13:44.922 --> 01:13:47.778
So I took it whole.

01:13:47.992 --> 01:13:50.592
I discovered course,

01:13:50.611 --> 01:13:53.224
and that was the end of the tale.

01:13:53.242 --> 01:13:56.112
And happiness of foxes.

01:14:56.002 --> 01:14:59.692
There were over a thousand in each conference was a success.

01:14:59.906 --> 01:15:04.576
But the prize was horrible headaches.

01:15:14.926 --> 01:15:18.136
- I hope Effy was not rude. - Of course not.

01:15:18.888 --> 01:15:23.168
Women should rely on them to get jobs.

01:15:24.815 --> 01:15:29.285
Instead of constantly ask companionship and attention.

01:15:33.055 --> 01:15:34.675
Sorry.

01:16:19.926 --> 01:16:21.846
Where have you been?

01:16:21.966 --> 01:16:23.796
In the rain.

01:16:23.926 --> 01:16:26.926
- Where? - Wherever.

01:16:27.918 --> 01:16:30.318
Where they brought me my feet.

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:36.750
Jeez, dress clothes or get sick.

01:16:37.951 --> 01:16:41.661
I am sick, sick of who I am.

01:16:43.991 --> 01:16:46.601
Do not know how you stand it.

01:16:47.405 --> 01:16:50.405
I can not continue to witness this torture,

01:16:50.414 --> 01:16:53.009
when I can not stop it, or do anything.

01:16:53.017 --> 01:16:54.957
Tell me what I should do.

01:16:54.979 --> 01:16:57.009
What I can do?

01:17:02.744 --> 01:17:05.734
Nothing to do.

01:18:30.924 --> 01:18:33.004
We return to London,

01:18:33.018 --> 01:18:35.964
I need to see what my book.

01:18:36.897 --> 01:18:40.017
- I can not go back. - We leave on Monday.

01:18:42.993 --> 01:18:44.953
I can not go back.

01:18:50.695 --> 01:18:57.065
The pains of eternal torment would not be worse than return to Denmark Hill you.

01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:01.489
I did not ask your opinion, just informed you.

01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:04.941
I can not go back.

01:19:04.967 --> 01:19:09.487
Do not think your behavior here has escaped me. Do Not.

01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:14.221
On the contrary, I've seen what you're trying to hide.

01:19:14.952 --> 01:19:18.932
Want to lose your reputation in the world?

01:19:18.996 --> 01:19:23.546
It would be a good piece of work for your father bankrupt.

01:19:24.691 --> 01:19:27.771
No pressure me more, Eufemia.

01:19:28.633 --> 01:19:30.913
For your own good.

01:19:35.921 --> 01:19:37.791
You hate.

01:19:53.542 --> 01:19:56.252
It has been listening and watching,

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:58.030
knows.

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.940
You want to ruin me? Put me in a compromise?

01:20:03.908 --> 01:20:06.928
I can never visit you in Denmark Hill.

01:20:09.926 --> 01:20:13.026
You need someone with you, think about it.

01:20:15.923 --> 01:20:18.983
I do not know ... maybe my sister Sofia.

01:20:20.968 --> 01:20:23.658
Your visit will not raise suspicions.

01:20:23.905 --> 01:20:26.545
Then you must organize it.

01:20:31.792 --> 01:20:36.002
- Mr Mc Fail, we are ready. - Yes, sir.

01:20:40.945 --> 01:20:43.255
Everett, you can help my wife.

01:21:32.919 --> 01:21:35.359
Do not do that, dear.

01:21:35.954 --> 01:21:38.324
You sound like an idiot.

01:21:45.757 --> 01:21:50.337
You are here and we have not yet received the portrait of Mr. Milais.

01:21:50.985 --> 01:21:54.985
I think in January seek time to finish posing.

01:21:55.013 --> 01:21:57.603
Well, I have wanted to see.

01:21:58.942 --> 01:22:03.342
Or maybe darling can mention it the next time you write him.

01:22:07.905 --> 01:22:09.905
I do not write.

01:22:23.891 --> 01:22:27.631
This is a new addition to our cellar.

01:22:31.004 --> 01:22:34.004
I think we should educate our palate the flavors,

01:22:34.021 --> 01:22:38.031
German wine before our trip.

01:22:38.073 --> 01:22:39.703
My son.

01:22:39.969 --> 01:22:41.839
Will you go away?

01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:43.840
All will.

01:22:43.881 --> 01:22:45.791
Do I have to go?

01:22:46.542 --> 01:22:47.982
But nobody said ...

01:22:48.015 --> 01:22:52.335
No start discussing something that was agreed for months.

01:23:23.273 --> 01:23:27.493
I do not know why you think you need to see the city Sofia.

01:23:27.551 --> 01:23:29.981
What's wrong with Beckham?

01:23:30.002 --> 01:23:32.390
He said he wanted to see it.

01:23:34.956 --> 01:23:38.816
- I did not say. - Shh. You can listen.

01:23:48.859 --> 01:23:51.849
Let's see a friend of mine.

01:23:52.106 --> 01:23:56.356
- Everett? - What did they say about him?

01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:00.910
Nothing, John said you made unhappy Everett.

01:24:01.232 --> 01:24:05.562
In the same way you made him unhappy.

01:24:05.851 --> 01:24:09.954
- Who is Everett? - A friend.

01:24:10.002 --> 01:24:14.782
- But we will not see it? - Sophia, please.

01:24:42.998 --> 01:24:46.008
But John had to teach safe,

01:24:46.277 --> 01:24:47.627
he must ...

01:24:51.970 --> 01:24:55.810
Let me understand, you say I do,

01:24:56.548 --> 01:25:02.478
yet at this time do not understand,

01:25:03.063 --> 01:25:06.853
the details of the most intimate relationship in marriage?

01:25:06.873 --> 01:25:09.232
What you have never experienced?

01:25:09.259 --> 01:25:11.719
He has never touched me.

01:25:11.863 --> 01:25:14.823
He's never done me his wife.

01:25:15.666 --> 01:25:20.476
Because he was disgusted by my body that first night.

01:25:22.243 --> 01:25:24.903
Then he told us to wait,

01:25:24.921 --> 01:25:27.601
until he was twenty.

01:25:27.802 --> 01:25:32.452
By then said that I did not like and that would be a sin.

01:25:32.787 --> 01:25:36.037
And a worse sin to have children.

01:25:36.783 --> 01:25:40.293
Because it was evil, and probably insane.

01:25:48.428 --> 01:25:49.808
And he ...

01:25:50.419 --> 01:25:55.999
Will never after that time, sought a relationship?

01:25:56.434 --> 01:25:57.714
Never.

01:26:00.283 --> 01:26:05.493
I've never heard anything so cruel, man must be ...

01:26:11.890 --> 01:26:15.096
If he has not done his wife physically,

01:26:15.112 --> 01:26:18.685
I think you're not his wife.

01:26:18.905 --> 01:26:22.287
But I have no knowledge of these matters.

01:26:22.314 --> 01:26:24.634
I'll legal and social inquiry,

01:26:24.655 --> 01:26:26.348
discreetly clear.

01:26:26.368 --> 01:26:30.244
I beg you still do not argue with him.

01:26:32.407 --> 01:26:35.239
I must say that I've read all his books,

01:26:35.258 --> 01:26:38.670
and I always found eccentric, but now,

01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:41.780
is more peculiar.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:45.450
And difficult to understand.

01:26:46.856 --> 01:26:50.106
You can sit, Ms. Raskins.

01:26:52.804 --> 01:26:54.784
You must be crazy.

01:27:00.485 --> 01:27:01.905
Whose is it?

01:27:05.723 --> 01:27:07.953
Effy.

01:27:15.394 --> 01:27:18.764
Honey, there's nothing else you can do.

01:27:18.797 --> 01:27:22.777
You have to let things take their course.

01:27:25.124 --> 01:27:26.644
Among ...

01:27:28.986 --> 01:27:30.956
Please sit down.

01:27:41.505 --> 01:27:45.675
I have the report of Dr. Lee ... here.

01:27:45.997 --> 01:27:50.767
You said he thinks her husband is crazy.

01:27:52.926 --> 01:27:57.426
It is interesting, but madness is not enough,

01:27:57.570 --> 01:27:59.820
for wanting a divorce.

01:27:59.978 --> 01:28:05.578
If it were, half of marriages in London would be in danger.

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:12.338
But the thing is this.

01:28:13.881 --> 01:28:19.641
We found that the usual signs of virginity are perfect.

01:28:20.872 --> 01:28:25.896
And she is naturally formed for it.

01:28:28.956 --> 01:28:32.436
Well ... There it is,

01:28:33.286 --> 01:28:36.356
I must say, in all my years ...

01:28:37.163 --> 01:28:40.493
It is an unprecedented case, Ms. Raskins.

01:28:40.512 --> 01:28:45.092
But I'm sure we can seek annulment of their marriage.

01:28:45.113 --> 01:28:48.173
Based on the non-consummation.

01:28:49.506 --> 01:28:53.726
However, we must be cautious,

01:28:53.758 --> 01:28:57.389
it is better to stay away from her husband,

01:28:57.405 --> 01:28:59.525
as you can, by Precautions In.

01:28:59.603 --> 01:29:00.979
Tell me.

01:29:01.017 --> 01:29:06.087
Say you do not make more effort than normal,

01:29:06.353 --> 01:29:11.033
for I do want to have sex.

01:29:17.973 --> 01:29:20.033
Spend a lot of time writing.

01:29:20.075 --> 01:29:22.135
If my angel it is.

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:29.991
I have written two books on modern painting.

01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:33.160
One of the architecture.

01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.450
And this ... for Venice.

01:29:48.995 --> 01:29:51.805
It is a rather large book.

01:29:51.976 --> 01:29:56.306
And then I will write a book so great,

01:29:58.697 --> 01:30:02.877
and will be about the conduct of your sister.

01:30:02.974 --> 01:30:06.204
Their iniquity, but do not tell him,

01:30:07.278 --> 01:30:11.288
because then you hate.

01:30:11.332 --> 01:30:14.582
That is our secret.

01:30:38.704 --> 01:30:41.674
Do not worry, it does not hurt.

01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:52.570
Thank you, George.

01:30:56.913 --> 01:30:58.213
George.

01:31:13.954 --> 01:31:16.894
What have you done? By God.

01:31:17.132 --> 01:31:19.322
I have not done anything.

01:31:19.958 --> 01:31:24.003
Dress up before my mother sees you.

01:31:24.836 --> 01:31:26.716
I will not.

01:31:30.763 --> 01:31:32.733
You disgust me.

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:36.612
I received a letter,

01:31:37.674 --> 01:31:39.364
my mother.

01:31:40.802 --> 01:31:45.512
Strange too Sofia and asked me to return to Scotland.

01:31:45.850 --> 01:31:49.130
Then I suggest you start packing.

01:31:54.974 --> 01:31:57.364
What does Mom?

01:32:00.017 --> 01:32:02.107
Not Mom.

01:32:31.754 --> 01:32:36.004
Check back your room for you there is nothing.

01:32:50.923 --> 01:32:52.663
Thank you, George.

01:32:53.907 --> 01:32:56.487
I wish you happiness, lady.

01:32:57.010 --> 01:33:02.390
A lot of suitcases for such a short visit.

01:33:02.946 --> 01:33:04.596
George, no...

01:33:04.941 --> 01:33:07.841
My name is John, actually ...

01:33:07.984 --> 01:33:11.974
- Where is Sophia? - Arriba.

01:33:12.911 --> 01:33:16.081
We can not have two John at home,

01:33:16.102 --> 01:33:18.422
so Mr Geoge chose for me.

01:33:18.483 --> 01:33:21.693
- Not cared. - He should care.

01:33:23.378 --> 01:33:25.348
You removed your name.

01:33:25.389 --> 01:33:28.079
Sofia miss the train.

01:33:29.984 --> 01:33:32.394
Start with suitcases, George.

01:33:48.906 --> 01:33:51.226
It makes no sense to join us.

01:33:51.908 --> 01:33:56.728
Alfred can find a cabin, and I know I have work.

01:34:11.041 --> 01:34:14.521
You could help me up, John.

01:34:39.959 --> 01:34:41.709
What are you doing?

01:34:49.902 --> 01:34:51.622
Set it here.

01:34:53.963 --> 01:34:56.033
What will you do with that?

01:34:56.967 --> 01:35:01.437
Leave it there, it's when Alfred return the carriage.

01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.890
Will not be angry?

01:35:20.934 --> 01:35:25.504
It is simply one of the most beautiful paintings in the world.

01:35:26.938 --> 01:35:29.578
You should be proud.

01:35:32.921 --> 01:35:38.671
Mr. Raskins, there is a man at the door for you.

01:35:58.903 --> 01:36:00.633
Where are we?

01:36:01.903 --> 01:36:03.683
You have to help.

01:36:03.965 --> 01:36:07.735
- Mr. John Raskins. - Yup.

01:36:07.867 --> 01:36:10.837
I have a summons to court.

01:36:10.878 --> 01:36:13.608
- For the Court? - Who?

01:36:13.626 --> 01:36:16.166
From Mrs. Raskins.

01:36:17.416 --> 01:36:21.936
The accused should receive the same papers, sir.

01:36:21.978 --> 01:36:24.668
It is a question of law.

01:36:30.614 --> 01:36:32.924
And on what concerns?

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:34.883
It is a private matter, sir.

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:36.692
You can say it.

01:36:37.834 --> 01:36:42.974
Well ... it's a petition for annulment of their marriage, sir.

01:36:46.943 --> 01:36:48.853
Based on what?

01:36:49.596 --> 01:36:52.556
It is a delicate matter, sir.

01:36:52.588 --> 01:36:56.588
My parents are aware of all my affairs.

01:36:56.934 --> 01:37:01.694
- Still ... - I demand to know on what basis.

01:37:03.935 --> 01:37:07.075
Based on the terms of powerlessness, sir.

01:37:36.911 --> 01:37:38.441
Hello.

01:37:38.838 --> 01:37:41.858
- Who are you? - Sofia.

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:43.590
What happened?

01:37:53.909 --> 01:37:56.199
You can not go there.

01:37:56.244 --> 01:37:58.854
He says he is prohibited.

01:37:58.889 --> 01:38:01.969
That and ruin you too.

01:38:11.015 --> 01:38:13.185
He says I should tell you this.

01:38:15.886 --> 01:38:18.506
He says he loves,

01:38:19.467 --> 01:38:21.927
but you can not get married for a while,

01:38:21.972 --> 01:38:24.058
without much deliberation,

01:38:24.297 --> 01:38:28.397
because it will not do anything wrong twice.

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:42.671
Say what?

01:38:44.212 --> 01:38:48.972
He said, "Tell him I hope to see. No,

01:38:49.907 --> 01:38:52.367
make her very happy. "

01:39:57.054 --> 01:39:59.244
