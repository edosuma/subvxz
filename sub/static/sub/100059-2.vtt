WEBVTT

00:05.744 --> 00:08.138
- So we still don't know
if the raccoons have a key

00:08.182 --> 00:09.705
or if someone is letting them
into the safe.

00:09.748 --> 00:10.880
And finally, good news:

00:10.923 --> 00:12.316
Mateo's bond hearing
has been scheduled.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.752
- Oh, cool.
- Oh, cool, nice.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.189
- His aunt's bringing
his lawyer by

00:15.232 --> 00:16.494
to get a statement
from me today.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.148
- Remember,
anything you say can and will

00:18.192 --> 00:20.194
be used against you
in a court of law.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.847
- Excellent point,
but she's just providing

00:21.891 --> 00:24.024
a character testimony
to help with his case.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.155
- Yeah, all I have to do
is tell him

00:25.199 --> 00:26.504
that Mateo is a vital employee.

00:26.548 --> 00:27.723
- Oh, that's how they get you.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.681
Next thing you know,
they'll be asking you,

00:29.725 --> 00:31.640
"Where were you April 25th?"

00:31.683 --> 00:33.076
and you'll be like,
"I don't know,"

00:33.120 --> 00:34.643
and then they'll be like,
"Well, then,

00:34.686 --> 00:37.341
why are your fingerprints
all over this dead body?"

00:37.385 --> 00:39.952
- Amy, please be careful.
- Yes.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.171
Okay, I will be careful

00:41.215 --> 00:42.912
in case
Mateo's immigration lawyer

00:42.955 --> 00:44.305
wants to frame me for murder.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.089
- Yes.
- Also, uh...

00:46.133 --> 00:49.484
Carol will be out for a few
days due to personal reasons.

00:49.527 --> 00:50.746
- By personal reasons,
do you mean

00:50.789 --> 00:52.400
she had a mental breakdown
when she found out

00:52.443 --> 00:53.923
Sandra and Jerry got engaged?

00:53.966 --> 00:56.839
- Oh, do you think she's
planning to "Gone Girl" Sandra?

00:56.882 --> 00:59.276
- I think she'd have to
"Gone Girl" Jerry.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.669
- What's the one
with the girl on the train?

01:00.712 --> 01:02.323
- "The Girl on the Train."
- Right.

01:02.366 --> 01:03.802
Maybe she's gonna do that
to Sandra.

01:03.846 --> 01:07.415
- Put her on a train?
- Oh, man, could you imagine?

01:07.458 --> 01:08.894
- Sorry I'm late, everybody.
- Oh!

01:08.938 --> 01:11.984
Thank God.
We thought you were on a train.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.073
- Aww, you guys.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.552
You got me a cake?

01:14.596 --> 01:16.163
- No,
those are yesterday's donuts.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.555
- Oh, I thought

01:17.599 --> 01:19.340
Dina was throwing me
a little engagement party,

01:19.383 --> 01:21.211
as, like,
a maid of honor thing.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.170
- Dina's your maid of honor?

01:23.213 --> 01:24.432
- Who else is she gonna ask?

01:24.475 --> 01:26.390
The old lady
who spits at her on the bus?

01:26.434 --> 01:29.089
- Dina, are you throwing
an engagement party?

01:29.132 --> 01:30.090
I have an outfit.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.395
- Absolutely not.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.267
Engagement party is not
a maid of honor duty.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.920
I printed a list
from the Internet.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.619
- Or maybe you just want
the party to be a surprise?

01:37.662 --> 01:39.142
- No.
I do not want that.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.579
I'm telling you,
do not expect a party.

01:41.623 --> 01:44.669
- Right.
I won't expect a party.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.802
- That's what
I just said, Sandra.

01:46.845 --> 01:49.848
Ugh.
Good luck, Jerry.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.901
- Amy?
- Ms. Liwanag.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.555
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.731
- This is Mateo's
immigration lawyer, Richard.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.254
Amy is the store manager

02:04.298 --> 02:06.778
who let my sweet nephew
get ripped away from us,

02:06.822 --> 02:09.172
suddenly and traumatically.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.608
- Anyway, uh,

02:10.652 --> 02:12.610
thank you for getting Mateo
a bond hearing.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.134
When is he gonna be released?

02:14.177 --> 02:15.787
- It's hard to say,
but it'll help

02:15.831 --> 02:18.050
if we can present Mateo
as someone who deserves

02:18.094 --> 02:19.835
to be out on bond
while we continue

02:19.878 --> 02:21.489
to fight his deportation.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.273
- Well, you know,
Mateo is one of our most

02:23.317 --> 02:25.971
exceptional employees.

02:26.015 --> 02:27.190
- That's it?

02:27.234 --> 02:30.019
Amy, my baby's future
is on the line.

02:30.062 --> 02:33.979
Please, don't mess this up
like Mateo says you always do.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.111
- W-what?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.156
No, I'm--

02:36.199 --> 02:37.896
I'm gonna make him look good.

02:37.940 --> 02:40.812
I prepared a statement
and everything.

02:40.856 --> 02:44.294
I was just waiting for you
to swear me in or whatever.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.731
- Oh, you don't have to be
under oath for this.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.820
- That's why I said
"or whatever."

02:48.864 --> 02:49.908
- Tita Irma!

02:49.952 --> 02:51.171
Ah!

02:51.214 --> 02:53.216
Kumusta na po?

02:53.260 --> 02:55.218
- Oh, that's right.
You two are roommates.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.524
- Mm-hmm.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.090
- It's been so good
to have him around.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.788
- Ah.
- Wait, anak.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.833
You forgot your lunch, Marcus.
- Ah.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.531
- Please don't forget
to eat, huh?

03:03.574 --> 03:05.315
- I do.
I forget to eat.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.709
Tita, what would I do
without you?

03:07.752 --> 03:09.972
Mwah.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.800
- So, do you need me

03:11.843 --> 03:13.454
to stay out
of any particular area

03:13.497 --> 03:15.978
while you set up
something special?

03:16.021 --> 03:17.240
- Sandra, again,

03:17.284 --> 03:18.850
I'm not throwing you
an engagement party.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.200
Not today.
Not ever.

03:21.636 --> 03:25.030
Okay, whatever you say.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.381
- You know, the more you deny
that there's a party,

03:27.424 --> 03:29.339
the more she's gonna think
it's actually happening.

03:29.383 --> 03:30.645
- Well,
that's textbook psychosis.

03:30.688 --> 03:31.907
- Why don't you
just throw her one?

03:31.950 --> 03:33.430
- Look, I know you like
to be everyone's

03:33.474 --> 03:34.562
manic pixie dream girl,

03:34.605 --> 03:35.824
but that's not how
I live my life.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.217
And an engagement party
is clearly

03:37.260 --> 03:38.218
not on my list of duties.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.915
- It's just one extra thing.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.004
- If I start doing extra things
that aren't on the list,

03:42.047 --> 03:44.224
she'll start asking for other
things that aren't on the list.

03:44.267 --> 03:47.531
Do you know how many things
aren't on the list, Jonah?

03:47.575 --> 03:48.924
- Do you want me
to actually answer--

03:48.967 --> 03:50.317
- Buying her a zoo.
Managing the zoo.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.709
Hiring an experienced staff.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.494
Euthanizing the giraffe
when it gets sick.

03:53.537 --> 03:54.756
- Why are these all zoo-based?

03:54.799 --> 03:56.279
- So you want me to start
with zoo things

03:56.323 --> 03:57.280
and then go to other topics

03:57.324 --> 03:59.239
and then switch back
to zoo stuff?

03:59.282 --> 04:00.762
Do you hear yourself?

04:03.199 --> 04:05.245
- ♪ I want the world to know

04:05.288 --> 04:07.464
♪ I got to let it show

04:09.161 --> 04:11.033
♪ I'm coming

04:11.076 --> 04:14.341
- You're finally emptying
Mateo's locker, huh?

04:14.384 --> 04:15.777
You okay?

04:15.820 --> 04:17.300
- Yeah, it sucks,

04:17.344 --> 04:19.084
but he's not gonna
be able to work here

04:19.128 --> 04:20.521
once he gets out of detention,

04:20.564 --> 04:22.958
so I'm just
getting it over with.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.525
- Yeah.

04:24.568 --> 04:28.746
I-I forgot my name tag, so...

04:39.931 --> 04:40.889
- Got it, Glenn?

04:40.932 --> 04:43.370
Looks like you got it.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.328
- Hey, Cheyenne.

04:45.372 --> 04:48.897
I don't want to be insensitive,
but Mateo's locker's in

04:48.940 --> 04:51.465
a pretty primo spot there
above the ground.

04:51.508 --> 04:54.381
Do you think maybe I could
move my stuff into it?

04:54.424 --> 04:57.253
- Oh, yeah, I guess you could.
- Hold up.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.428
If anyone's
gonna get Mateo's locker,

04:58.472 --> 04:59.429
it should be me.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.039
I already took his room

05:01.083 --> 05:02.345
and most of his underwear.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.564
It just makes sense.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.000
- Yeah, but my doctor said

05:05.043 --> 05:08.133
that I'm down
to my last 100 knee bends.

05:08.177 --> 05:11.789
- Hmm, well, you guys both
make pretty good arguments.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.530
Let me think about it,
and then I'll pick

05:13.574 --> 05:14.792
who gets the locker.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.490
- Fair enough.
- Okay.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.755
Gah, I forgot my ChapStick.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.585
- And then I ended with,
"Mateo's dedication

05:24.628 --> 05:26.978
"to customer service
is unmatched,

05:27.022 --> 05:30.460
and his work ethic
is an example for us all."

05:30.504 --> 05:32.375
- Oh, did you use my line
about how the flag

05:32.419 --> 05:34.377
is made up of the threads
of immigrants?

05:34.421 --> 05:37.902
- Um, I just wasn't sure
that it...

05:37.946 --> 05:39.339
meant anything.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.950
- I told them
how Mateo and I are BFFs.

05:41.993 --> 05:44.866
Tay-Tay and Tine-Tine:
the slut squad.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.520
- Wait, you talked
to Richard too?

05:46.563 --> 05:49.610
- Yeah, and I said how Mateo's
always serving up the tea,

05:49.653 --> 05:51.263
like when he told
that lost little girl

05:51.307 --> 05:52.482
that she was better off now

05:52.526 --> 05:54.702
because her mommy
was hot trash.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.399
- Classic slut squad tea.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.793
- No, Justine,
we're supposed to be proving

05:58.836 --> 06:01.578
that Mateo has
good moral character.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.363
Why would you tell
the lawyer that?

06:03.406 --> 06:04.755
- I was under oath.

06:04.799 --> 06:07.192
- No, you're not
under oath, Justine!

06:07.236 --> 06:09.369
Everybody knows that!

06:14.286 --> 06:15.940
- So?
What do you guys think?

06:15.984 --> 06:18.029
- Uh, what do we think of what?

06:18.073 --> 06:19.422
- I got a brand-new polo.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.423
Can't you smell it?

06:20.467 --> 06:21.598
Fresh out of the bag.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.383
- Oh, yeah, for sure.
- A bag, wow.

06:23.426 --> 06:27.212
- I just thought I'd look
my best because of the, um...

06:27.256 --> 06:29.214
Engagement party.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.347
I can't wait
to send pictures to my mom.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.523
I even went out
and bought a camera phone.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.264
- Yeah, you know what,
Sandra, Dina's not--

06:35.307 --> 06:37.222
- You look great, Sandra.
Doesn't she's look great?

06:37.266 --> 06:39.050
That's the perfect outfit
for the party.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.531
- Aww, thank you, Jonah,
you flirt.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.056
- Dude, what are you doing?

06:45.100 --> 06:46.580
You know Dina's not
gonna give her a party.

06:46.623 --> 06:47.711
- Yeah, I know, but I-I figured

06:47.755 --> 06:49.060
I'd just throw
something together.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.453
I mean,
look how happy Sandra looks,

06:50.497 --> 06:52.499
and she has so little.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.240
- Yeah, exactly.
She doesn't expect much.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.764
You don't tell a fish
about land.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.243
You just leave it.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.375
You're not gonna leave it,
are you?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.724
- Nah, I'm already
too excited about it.

07:00.768 --> 07:01.943
- Kay.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.248
- And I was like,
"I think I just broke

07:03.292 --> 07:05.381
my tailbone,
can you pull the box off me?"

07:05.425 --> 07:07.339
'Cause I was pinned
under this washing machine.

07:07.383 --> 07:10.647
But Mateo
was too busy laughing.

07:10.691 --> 07:11.648
That's Mateo for you.

07:11.692 --> 07:12.823
He's got a great
sense of humor.

07:12.867 --> 07:13.911
- Hey, Eugene.
- Hey.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.479
- Um, I need you to go

07:16.523 --> 07:19.656
and scrub the walls.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.397
- You got it!

07:21.441 --> 07:23.225
Yes!

07:23.268 --> 07:24.661
- He's fun, isn't he?

07:24.705 --> 07:26.663
But I would strike everything
he said from the record.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.273
- Yeah, I didn't write
any of it down.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.101
- Besides, I already told you
Mateo's great,

07:30.145 --> 07:31.668
so isn't that enough?

07:31.712 --> 07:32.800
- Honestly, right now,

07:32.843 --> 07:34.323
I'm representing
a Pulitzer Prize winner,

07:34.366 --> 07:36.151
a heart surgeon
that's a father of six,

07:36.194 --> 07:37.674
and a former Olympic athlete,

07:37.718 --> 07:40.111
and those people aren't
guaranteed to get out on bond.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.852
So no, sorry.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.985
It's not enough.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.118
- What the hell is this?

07:47.162 --> 07:48.468
I said no engagement party.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.426
- Yeah, but she seems
so excited,

07:50.470 --> 07:51.993
so I just figured
that maybe I would--

07:52.036 --> 07:53.385
- Make me look like
a giant a-hole?

07:53.429 --> 07:54.778
- Um, no.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.171
- Because that's
what I look like

07:56.214 --> 07:58.303
when I say "no party"
and then you throw one anyway.

07:58.347 --> 07:59.783
- Well, you could still
throw her one.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.307
- It's not on the list!

08:02.351 --> 08:03.352
Jonah!

08:03.395 --> 08:05.049
The list came
from the Internet.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.443
The International Network!

08:07.487 --> 08:09.097
- Yeah, but--
that's not--

08:09.140 --> 08:10.402
- I am the maid of honor,

08:10.446 --> 08:13.318
and I said no party for Sandra.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.061
- Yeah, gah, okay.
Yeah, I got it.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.323
Great, no party.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.674
- Good.
Glad you understand.

08:25.853 --> 08:29.030
- Okay, Richard's having lunch,
so we've got about 20 minutes

08:29.073 --> 08:30.858
to think of good things
to say about Mateo.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.773
So, what makes him special?

08:32.816 --> 08:36.298
- Oh, I like that Mateo
gives zero Fs.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.909
- I also give zero Fs.
It's not unique to Mateo.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.171
- Okay,
we actually need stories

08:40.215 --> 08:43.044
where Mateo gives
a lot of Fs, like big Fs.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.915
- Guys,
we're overthinking this.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.048
One of us just needs
to marry Mateo.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.267
I'll do it.
Tita would be over the moon.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.486
She's our aunt.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.096
- Marriage only works
if you originally

08:52.140 --> 08:53.315
came here on a visa,
which Mateo did not.

08:53.358 --> 08:54.925
- Susmaryosep!

08:54.969 --> 08:56.492
That's like a swear
in our language.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.102
- All right, well,
here are some defenses

08:58.146 --> 08:59.277
that are used
in detention cases:

08:59.321 --> 09:00.670
involved in community service,

09:00.714 --> 09:01.845
active organ donor.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.543
- Yes, exactly,
so we just need to think

09:03.586 --> 09:06.154
if Mateo fits
into anything like that.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.373
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.202
- Or we could just embellish
a little.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.640
- You want us to lie
to a lawman?

09:13.683 --> 09:14.728
- No!

09:14.771 --> 09:16.033
I'm just saying,

09:16.077 --> 09:18.296
let's think of things
that Mateo might do.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.255
I mean, we don't know
that he wouldn't do

09:20.298 --> 09:21.822
Habitat for Humanity.

09:21.865 --> 09:22.997
- Oh, he for sure wouldn't.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.042
- Cheyenne, work with me!

09:25.086 --> 09:26.609
- And it wasn't easy,

09:26.653 --> 09:29.656
but Mateo managed to teach
those inner city kids

09:29.699 --> 09:31.962
how to express themselves,

09:32.006 --> 09:34.574
through the power of music.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.793
- Are you just telling me
the plot to "Sister Act 2"?

09:36.837 --> 09:38.360
- "Back in the Habit," yes.

09:38.403 --> 09:42.059
- Which I heard is loosely
based on Mateo's life.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.627
So that's wild.

09:46.107 --> 09:51.242
- So, one time, Mateo...

09:53.375 --> 09:54.724
It's a funny story.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.204
It's a true story.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.640
- Mateo can't be deported.

09:57.684 --> 10:01.818
He was the only witness
to a murder.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.341
- What murder?

10:03.385 --> 10:04.734
- Well, I can't talk about it,

10:04.778 --> 10:08.869
because the murderer is...

10:08.912 --> 10:11.088
in this room.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.658
- I was told
I was supposed to come in here?

10:15.702 --> 10:18.313
- Sandra, this isn't
your engagement party.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.274
- Uh, where was I?

10:23.318 --> 10:25.799
- Mateo.
- Mateo.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.104
- So I forgot to mention

10:27.148 --> 10:31.456
that Mateo is donating
his liver to me.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.937
Because mine
is completely destroyed.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.287
Give that vino to me-no.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.115
- Justine, get out.
- Okay.

10:40.552 --> 10:43.251
- No one is behind the door!

10:43.294 --> 10:45.470
- Okay, if you're gonna have
the locker next to me,

10:45.514 --> 10:47.429
we're probably gonna have to
talk in the mornings,

10:47.472 --> 10:49.300
so you each have eight seconds

10:49.344 --> 10:50.693
to show me
how interesting you are.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.086
Glenn, go.

10:52.129 --> 10:55.393
- Uh, okay, so, I-I was in
traffic this morning--

10:55.437 --> 10:57.134
- Okay, I'm so sorry, Glenn,

10:57.178 --> 10:59.267
but I really don't like
stories about cars.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.660
Marcus, you're up.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.313
- My parents didn't talk to me
till I was five

11:02.357 --> 11:03.575
to see if I'd learn
sign language--

11:03.619 --> 11:04.925
I didn't--
last year, I had intense

11:04.968 --> 11:06.753
stomach cramps that wound up
being a spider's nest

11:06.796 --> 11:08.493
inside my body--
worked out great, though,

11:08.537 --> 11:10.495
got to keep the spiders--
and all my teeth are fake.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.409
Time!

11:11.453 --> 11:13.194
Yes!
In your face, Glenn.

11:13.237 --> 11:17.241
- I-I-I ate a pencil because
I thought it was chocolate!

11:17.285 --> 11:19.591
- Okay, I'm listening.

11:19.635 --> 11:22.159
- Richard, this is Jeff Sutton
from Cloud 9 corporate.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.639
He is a huge deal over here.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.815
- Ah, I don't know
about huge deal,

11:25.859 --> 11:27.338
but, uh, big deal, sure.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.950
I do get to use
the company car.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.212
Once.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.735
Drove the VP's wife
to Indianapolis

11:32.779 --> 11:35.259
'cause she was too drunk,
but I got to listen

11:35.303 --> 11:37.261
to whatever I wanted to
on the radio.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.437
"Pompeii" by Bastille, anyone?

11:39.481 --> 11:41.788
- I think Jeff's testimony
is going to highlight

11:41.831 --> 11:44.704
how important Mateo is
to the company.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.618
- Yes, real quick,
do you know if Mateo

11:46.662 --> 11:49.186
has been getting
any of my messages?

11:49.230 --> 11:50.840
- Jeff.
Focus.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.712
- Okay, Amy, look,
I see what you're trying to do,

11:52.755 --> 11:55.715
but I have to present
actual facts, and so far,

11:55.758 --> 11:57.412
all I've got is,
he's a good employee,

11:57.455 --> 11:59.370
he's sometimes nice,
and he has glasses,

11:59.414 --> 12:01.024
which isn't even a thing,

12:01.068 --> 12:02.460
but I had to write
something down

12:02.504 --> 12:03.635
because it was getting awkward

12:03.679 --> 12:05.072
that I wasn't
writing anything down.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.161
Anyway, look, I'm sorry,

12:07.204 --> 12:08.902
but I can't waste
anymore time here.

12:10.512 --> 12:11.556
- Really, Jeff?

12:11.600 --> 12:12.775
You couldn't just say,

12:12.819 --> 12:14.559
"Mateo is an integral part
of the company"?

12:14.603 --> 12:17.562
You had to babble on
about "Bastille" by Pompeii?

12:17.606 --> 12:19.564
- "Pompeii" by Bastille.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.914
You're showing your age
a little.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.611
Besides, this is your fault.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.656
If you had stopped the store
from unionizing like I said,

12:24.700 --> 12:26.702
Cloud 9 would have
never sent ICE.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.008
- Why do people keep
blaming this on me?

12:28.051 --> 12:29.183
How was I supposed to know?

12:29.226 --> 12:30.227
- Wait, I'm sorry.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.402
Did you say
the company called ICE

12:31.446 --> 12:32.882
because you were unionizing?

12:32.926 --> 12:34.405
- I mostly said
it was Amy's fault, but yeah.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.320
- ICE isn't supposed to do
worksite enforcement

12:36.364 --> 12:37.539
during a labor dispute.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.193
If you guys have proof

12:39.236 --> 12:40.411
that corporate
ordered the raid,

12:40.455 --> 12:42.283
then we might have
a better chance.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.588
- Proof?

12:43.632 --> 12:44.633
Yes.

12:44.676 --> 12:47.462
We have that.
W-we'll go get it.

12:48.942 --> 12:49.899
- Jerry.

12:49.943 --> 12:50.900
You're here...

12:50.944 --> 12:52.467
and dressy.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.512
Uh, Sandra,

12:54.556 --> 12:56.253
I know I said the party--

12:56.297 --> 12:57.341
- I know, I know.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.908
We'll make sure
to act surprised.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.170
- I'm so excited.

13:00.214 --> 13:01.606
This is my first party.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.305
- Like... ever?

13:06.176 --> 13:08.222
Wow, um...

13:08.265 --> 13:11.181
okay, well, you two lovebirds

13:11.225 --> 13:13.096
just, uh, hang out.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.969
Uh, something's a-coming.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.713
And it is gonna be... good.

13:28.633 --> 13:29.809
- Hey, Jerry, good to see you.

13:29.852 --> 13:30.984
- Really?

13:31.027 --> 13:33.247
- Uh, yeah.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.946
- Okay,
a little corporate intel.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.513
Neil has three assistants.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.820
Hopefully, we get Charlene.
She's new.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.386
She's real eager to please.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.867
Her father just died,
so don't mention that.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.129
- I wouldn't.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.348
It's fine,
I'm just gonna put on

13:47.391 --> 13:49.741
my sweet and innocent voice,
and bam,

13:49.785 --> 13:51.656
they won't even know
what they're confessing to.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.702
- That's great, they're gonna
be putty in your hands.

13:53.745 --> 13:54.746
Putty.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.880
- Neil Penderson's office,
this is Gail.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.447
- Who the  is Gail?

13:59.490 --> 14:00.491
- Shh.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.145
Um, hi!

14:02.189 --> 14:05.496
I'm calling from Immigration
and Customs Enforcement,

14:05.540 --> 14:09.413
and I just need to verify
some records.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.241
- Work it.
Just work that putty.

14:11.285 --> 14:12.721
- Uh, okay,
what are you looking for?

14:12.764 --> 14:14.027
- Um, yes,

14:14.070 --> 14:17.857
it says here
that we conducted a raid

14:17.900 --> 14:20.468
at your
Ozark Highlands location

14:20.511 --> 14:23.906
at your... behest.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.255
And--
- I'm sorry.

14:25.299 --> 14:28.171
I'm not authorized
to comment on that.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.261
- Okay, um, but I'm with ICE,

14:31.305 --> 14:33.133
so you can tell me.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.791
- Mmm.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.358
Mmm.

14:41.402 --> 14:44.100
Okay, I like that I can't taste
any of the flavors in here.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.407
It just tastes sweet,
which, again, I like.

14:46.450 --> 14:47.756
And this one,

14:47.799 --> 14:49.236
while the flavor isn't as good,

14:49.279 --> 14:51.281
I do appreciate
the presentation.

14:51.325 --> 14:52.848
- Thank you,
I chose to put the entire

14:52.892 --> 14:56.025
Snickers bar in there in case
you wanted a snack after.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.157
- I could put food
in there too.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.289
I got a club sandwich
in the fridge.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.466
- Actually, do you know what
would go really good with this?

15:02.510 --> 15:04.642
Disney World tickets.
- I can do that!

15:04.686 --> 15:06.688
I just need to get
my credit card.

15:06.731 --> 15:07.907
- That's not fair.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.474
I don't know where
to get a credit card.

15:10.518 --> 15:11.954
- You know you don't have
the authority

15:11.998 --> 15:13.651
to assign lockers, right?

15:13.695 --> 15:16.089
- Yeah, I'm just doing this
to get stuff.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.655
- Mateo would be proud.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.440
- I know.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.230
- What do you got there, buddy?

15:27.274 --> 15:29.145
- Uh, just--
I just--

15:29.189 --> 15:31.365
this, I just, um,
I forgot my lunch today,

15:31.408 --> 15:34.846
so I thought I'd--
I'd have a little treat.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.022
- Well, if that's your lunch,

15:36.065 --> 15:38.328
don't let me stop you
from eating it.

15:38.372 --> 15:41.070
- Oh.
Okay, uh, great, cool.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.464
Here we go.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.901
Yummy.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.731
Mmm.
Mmm.

15:49.774 --> 15:50.906
Well, you know what?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.213
That is probably enough for me.

15:53.256 --> 15:54.954
I am gonna save
the rest of this.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.346
- We're not leaving this table

15:56.390 --> 15:59.915
until you finish every bite
of your lunch.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.134
And you better hurry.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.744
Your break's over
in eight minutes.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.443
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.099
- Hi, Garrett.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.535
- Hey.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.015
- Cool.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.843
Um, so before,
when you said it was good

16:14.886 --> 16:17.411
to see me,
I should've told you,

16:17.454 --> 16:19.804
it's good to see you too.

16:19.848 --> 16:23.069
- Oh.
Okay.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.419
Well, talk to you later.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.769
- When?

16:27.812 --> 16:28.944
- What?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.729
- When do you think
we'll talk later?

16:31.773 --> 16:33.557
- I don't know, buddy.

16:35.559 --> 16:36.865
- Buddy.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.564
- ♪ Tell me lies

16:40.608 --> 16:43.045
♪ Tell me sweet little lies

16:45.526 --> 16:47.093
- So your contact fell through?

16:47.136 --> 16:49.399
- Yeah, and I'm kicking myself,
because if I had just recorded

16:49.443 --> 16:50.922
the meeting
when they decided to call ICE--

16:50.966 --> 16:52.881
- Wait, I didn't realize
you were in the room.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.839
Well, we can just have you go
on record at the hearing.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.102
- What?
Really?

16:56.145 --> 16:57.799
Amazing!
Let's do that.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.019
- Yeah, yeah.
On the record?

17:00.062 --> 17:01.846
Like the official record?

17:01.890 --> 17:03.631
I mean, like, corporate
could hear that I said it?

17:03.674 --> 17:05.763
- Jeff.
- No, it's totally fine.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.330
Totally fine.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.766
But, you know what?

17:08.810 --> 17:10.681
Um, yeah.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.074
I'm not gonna do it.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.611
- I'm really enjoying
our male friendship.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.744
- Yep.
Okay.

17:31.963 --> 17:34.096
- Will you be my best man?

17:34.140 --> 17:39.232
- Um...

17:39.275 --> 17:41.669
- I'm sorry, I can't afford
to lose this job.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.105
I just bought a third Subaru.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.107
- How could you do this
to Mateo?

17:45.151 --> 17:47.762
- Look, what if I lose my job
and he doesn't get out?

17:47.805 --> 17:49.329
I mean, then nobody wins.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.852
- Hey, Amy.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.941
I just finished cleaning out
Mateo's locker.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.551
Should I send this stuff
to his family?

17:54.595 --> 17:57.119
- I mean, I guess, if it's just
a bunch of personal stuff.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.687
- Mostly gum
and a few Celine Dion hats.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.732
- Wait.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.169
What's this?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.563
He still had this
in his locker?

18:06.607 --> 18:08.652
- Yeah, he had it
hung up in there.

18:08.696 --> 18:11.133
- Huh.

18:11.177 --> 18:14.180
I didn't realize
he still had feelings.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.792
Wow, this is big, um...

18:18.706 --> 18:19.663
I'll do it.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.143
- What?

18:21.187 --> 18:22.405
- I'll testify.
- Oh, my God.

18:22.449 --> 18:23.841
Jeff, thank God!

18:23.885 --> 18:25.147
- I'm gonna see
if I can catch Richard.

18:25.191 --> 18:28.150
- Yes! Go, go!
- Okay, all right.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.891
- How did you find
a picture so fast?

18:29.934 --> 18:32.241
- It's still
Jeff's profile picture.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.851
Should I just throw it
in the trash or...

18:33.895 --> 18:35.766
- Yeah.
Nobody wants that.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.684
- Jonah.
You sure you don't want any?

18:40.728 --> 18:42.121
- Oh, no, I-I'm all good.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.862
I-I-I threw up a bunch of cake
a little while ago.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.690
- Where's the wedding--
- Shh!

18:46.734 --> 18:47.691
Eugene!

18:47.735 --> 18:49.345
Shh, quiet!

18:49.389 --> 18:52.914
A-and we only talk
if it's completely necessary.

18:58.528 --> 18:59.964
- I just want to thank you.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.750
This is better
than I ever imagined.

19:04.578 --> 19:05.666
- Really?

19:05.709 --> 19:06.710
- Yeah.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.410
- Uh...

19:10.453 --> 19:11.976
- Well, well, well.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.196
Look who I caught red-handed
with your pants down

19:14.240 --> 19:17.068
and egg all over your tiny,
tiny, bush baby face.

19:17.112 --> 19:19.201
- Dina, you want some cake?

19:19.245 --> 19:20.942
- You just couldn't help
yourself, could you?

19:20.985 --> 19:22.683
You had to make me
look like an a-hole.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.075
- Hi, Dina.
- Nobody asked you!

19:24.119 --> 19:26.077
- Dina, I wasn't trying
to make you look bad.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.949
I just felt bad for Sandra.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.472
- Everybody feels bad
for Sandra!

19:29.516 --> 19:30.778
But I get it.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.214
If this is what I need to do
to stop you

19:32.258 --> 19:34.651
from humiliating me,
I'll do it.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.349
I'll violate the Internet.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.307
All right, everybody,
this isn't the real party.

19:38.351 --> 19:41.876
The real party is gonna happen
Saturday morning at 7:00 a.m.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.747
- Um, Saturday's
actually my day off.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.314
- And I used
my last sick day today.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.316
- Oh, Jerry, no one's gonna
notice if you're not there.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.145
Now, obviously,
it's mandatory for you.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.190
- Okay.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.540
Do you need me
to bring anything?

19:53.583 --> 19:54.758
- Cups would be nice.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.195
Not plastic, though.
Glass.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.066
Drinks.
And probably food.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.937
People are gonna want to eat
at this thing, right?

19:59.981 --> 20:01.591
- Food.
- Yeah, maybe empanadas?

20:09.295 --> 20:12.298
- Hey, guys.

20:12.341 --> 20:13.864
I brought
some chili pepper lights

20:13.908 --> 20:15.649
to spice up the party.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.825
That's what the package says.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.871
Oh, you guys
are eating cake already.

20:20.915 --> 20:24.440
- Sandra, look.
Mateo got out.

20:24.484 --> 20:25.528
- Hey, Sandra!

20:25.572 --> 20:26.703
Sorry, I know this is probably

20:26.747 --> 20:28.314
all for you, but I just...

20:34.058 --> 20:37.018
- Sandra, Jesus, let Mateo
finish eating your cake.

20:37.061 --> 20:41.457
Sorry, she's been turning
into a bit of a bridezilla.

20:41.501 --> 20:44.025
- I mean, this is all
very sweet of you guys.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.810
- Mateo, I just want to say,
I am so happy

20:46.854 --> 20:48.899
this is finally over.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.119
- Thanks, but it's not over,
I'm just

20:51.162 --> 20:53.252
out on bond while I go through
deportation proceedings.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.558
- Yeah, well,
at least you're free.

20:55.602 --> 20:58.344
- Well, I do have to wear
this ankle monitor.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.954
So not exactly free.

21:01.521 --> 21:02.783
- I once ate a pencil

21:02.826 --> 21:06.526
'cause I thought
it was chocolate.

21:06.569 --> 21:07.788
- Oh, hey, Mateo?

21:07.831 --> 21:09.964
Would you maybe mention
to your Tita Irma

21:10.007 --> 21:12.662
that I sort of, like,
made all of this possible?

21:12.706 --> 21:13.924
That would be great.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.230
- I'm literally texting her
right now,

21:15.274 --> 21:16.492
so I'll just tell her.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.233
- Hey, man, I need you
to go to Dollywood with me

21:18.277 --> 21:20.496
for Jerry's bachelor party.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.020
- Um, what?
