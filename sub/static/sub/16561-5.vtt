[crowd cheering]

00:03.237 --> 00:04.205
- City runners, welcome...

00:04.238 --> 00:06.407
[upbeat music]

00:06.440 --> 00:09.110
Now, remember to
stay hydrated out here

00:09.143 --> 00:11.112
to beat the heat.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.246
Keep it up.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.414
*

00:13.447 --> 00:17.251
- See? Taking a header at
your first marathon is nothing.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.554
Now, taking a header into a pool
in your wedding dress?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.390
both: Epic fail.
- Right?

00:22.423 --> 00:24.592
- No, that would be taking 20
minutes to put on a Band-Aid.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.827
- Sorry. Totally my fault.
- No, no, not at all.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.463
Take as long as you need.
You, on the other hand,

00:29.497 --> 00:32.466
have a superhero
with super intestinal discomfort

00:32.500 --> 00:35.636
who requires
your immediate attention.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.338
- [retching]

00:37.371 --> 00:39.640
[spitting]

00:48.282 --> 00:51.652
[crowd cheering]

00:51.685 --> 00:54.088
- Almost halfway.
You holding up?

00:54.122 --> 00:56.490
- I'm sure that runner's high is
gonna kick in any second now.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.326
That or heatstroke.
- Yeah.

00:58.359 --> 01:02.130
It's not the best day
for a heat wave.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.199
Yeah, I was thinking maybe
later we can do something else.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.300
- What?
Like collapse?

01:06.334 --> 01:10.304
- No.
Maybe a bedroom activity.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.240
Or kitchen table.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.175
Shower.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.843
- Let's go, Doc.
Pick up the pace.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.612
- [laughs]

01:18.646 --> 01:21.615
- Now, try to keep it elevated,
and remember: ice, not heat.

01:21.649 --> 01:25.085
- Oh, please don't mention heat.
It's hot as balls out here.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.688
- We need help.
A guy got run over.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.423
- Grab an aid kit.
- Got it.

01:29.457 --> 01:32.426
[dramatic music]

01:32.460 --> 01:33.627
*

01:33.661 --> 01:35.263
- Three. Two. One.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.165
- Aah!

01:37.198 --> 01:40.601
*

01:40.634 --> 01:42.203
- My brakes went out.
You've got to help him.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.173
- We'll do all we can.
- [groaning]

01:45.206 --> 01:46.507
- [speaking Spanish]

01:46.540 --> 01:48.442
- Ignacio.
- Where does it hurt, Ignacio?

01:48.476 --> 01:50.244
- [speaking Spanish]

01:50.278 --> 01:51.245
Aah.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.580
[gasping]

01:52.613 --> 01:55.149
- Maggie, we got
a bike versus auto.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.150
- [gasping]

01:56.184 --> 01:58.219
- Diminished breath sounds
on the left side.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.454
Sounds like it's full of fluid.
I think his lung collapsed.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.722
- Marathon traffic
and power outages

02:01.755 --> 02:03.491
from the heat
have paramedics backed up.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.226
We're on our own for a while.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.261
- Well, he doesn't have a while.
He needs a chest tube now.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.596
- Not from you.
You've never put one in.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.630
- Be my guest.

02:09.663 --> 02:10.631
- Neither of us is allowed
to do it.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.300
- Then he's gonna die.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.667
- Maggie, I need Goodwin.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.569
- [groaning]
- Sir, just hang on.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.306
We're gonna do everything
we can for you, okay?

02:18.339 --> 02:20.374
We're gonna help you, okay?

02:20.408 --> 02:21.375
Just hang on.

02:28.382 --> 02:28.516
.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.653
- Sit tight, April.
Dr. Halstead's on the way.

02:32.686 --> 02:36.590
No, no, no.
You let him make that call.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.826
All right.
You keep me posted.

02:38.859 --> 02:39.660
- How goes the battle?

02:39.693 --> 02:42.663
- Ugh, it's supposed to
hit 105 today,

02:42.696 --> 02:45.333
so we've got a generator
on standby

02:45.366 --> 02:47.535
just in case
our grid goes dark.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.938
- Sharon, listen.
Bert called me.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.740
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.575
He wants to get together
for drinks,

02:54.608 --> 02:56.477
and I just--I wanted to check in

02:56.510 --> 02:57.678
with you
before I responded to him.

02:57.711 --> 03:02.850
- Daniel,
you do whatever you like.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.952
I'm good.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.461
Hey, Peter...

03:13.494 --> 03:17.365
your husband is
a divorce attorney, isn't he?

03:17.398 --> 03:19.600
- Best in the city.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.702
- Text me his number.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.474
- [groaning]

03:26.507 --> 03:27.475
[tense music]

03:27.508 --> 03:28.476
[crowd cheering]

03:28.509 --> 03:29.843
- I can do this.
- With what?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.813
We don't even have a chest tube.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.682
- I got a suction tube.
- No.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.784
You are not gonna jerry-rig
your way into this guy's chest.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.419
- He's got no chance
unless I do.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.887
- Goodwin said to wait for Will.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.921
- How long is that gonna take?

03:40.954 --> 03:41.922
- [sighs]

03:41.955 --> 03:44.758
- [groaning]

03:44.792 --> 03:46.960
- Got a neck pulse,
but it's thready.

03:46.994 --> 03:50.464
*

03:50.498 --> 03:51.765
- He's out.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.367
I've got to relieve
the pressure on his lung.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.570
- BP 82 over palp.
Sat at 82%.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.406
- I'm doing this.
- Noah.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.840
Noah!

03:59.873 --> 04:06.947
*

04:09.850 --> 04:11.819
[crowd cheering]

04:11.852 --> 04:14.888
*

04:14.922 --> 04:16.790
Pulse is coming up.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.526
You did it.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.661
- Yeah, but the tube's not
slowing down.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.730
Damn.
It's a bad bleed.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.533
- Okay.
Come on.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.667
He needs surgery.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.736
We need to intubate
and give him blood.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.638
- Where the hell is Will?

04:30.671 --> 04:31.872
- Hey, Nat.

04:31.905 --> 04:35.676
Eight-year-old girl with sudden
onset deafness in treatment 2.

04:35.709 --> 04:36.777
Oh.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.811
They said the heat wave's

04:37.845 --> 04:40.548
supposed to be worse than '95.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.649
[sighs]

04:41.682 --> 04:43.551
- Hi.
I'm Dr. Manning.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.986
I understand Phoebe's
experiencing some hearing loss?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.989
- Yeah...we were headed
to cheer on the runners.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.991
She was skipping ahead.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.460
A semi started backing up.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.496
I was screaming,
and she couldn't hear me.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.597
A few seconds later--

04:56.630 --> 04:57.831
- What?

04:57.865 --> 04:59.032
- I don't want to
think about it.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.468
It's okay, sweetie.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.469
[dings]

05:01.502 --> 05:03.437
- Can you hear that, Phoebe?

05:03.471 --> 05:04.638
- Not really.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.706
- Hmm.
[dings]

05:05.739 --> 05:09.042
How about now?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.478
- Sort of.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.779
A little.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.482
- Okay, her hearing is
diminished on the right side

05:14.515 --> 05:15.816
and nearly absent on the left.

05:15.849 --> 05:20.488
Does she have any prior history
of head trauma or hearing loss?

05:20.521 --> 05:23.090
- No.
Not that I can think of.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.625
I mean, there have been
a few times

05:24.658 --> 05:25.959
where I've had to call her
more than once

05:25.993 --> 05:29.997
within these last few months,
but nothing like this.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.600
- Okay, well,
I'd like to order a head CT

05:32.633 --> 05:34.668
just so we can figure out
what's going on, okay?

05:34.702 --> 05:35.869
- Okay.
- Thank you.

05:35.903 --> 05:36.870
- Wait.

05:36.904 --> 05:37.938
- Hmm?

05:37.971 --> 05:39.973
- Are you going to fix my ears?

05:40.007 --> 05:43.110
- I'm sure gonna try.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.012
Be back shortly.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.047
[tense music]

05:47.080 --> 05:49.049
- [grunts]

05:49.082 --> 05:50.751
I-I can't get it in.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.019
- You have to
capture the tongue.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.887
Elevate the jaw.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.890
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm trying to intubate.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.527
He had a massive hemothorax, and
I had to put in a chest tube.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.861
- No, what you had to
do was wait.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.929
- Dr. Halstead,
this man would have died.

06:01.962 --> 06:02.996
- Yeah, judging by all
the blood, if we don't get him

06:03.030 --> 06:06.600
into surgery in the next
few minutes, he will anyway.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.602
*

06:08.636 --> 06:09.903
[crowd cheering]

06:09.937 --> 06:11.772
I'm in.
Bag him.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.642
- Any ETA on transport?
- Still saying it'll be a while.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.610
- We could open his chest.
Try to address the bleed.

06:16.644 --> 06:17.845
It might buy him enough time
for the ambulance to show up.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.881
- Yeah, it might--there's no
guarantee I could even find it.

06:20.914 --> 06:24.552
- The only guarantee is
he'll die if we don't try.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.054
- No, I've been down this road
before trying extreme measures.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.522
It doesn't end well.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.824
[crowd cheering]

06:30.858 --> 06:32.125
*

06:32.159 --> 06:33.661
- His pressure is down.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.996
Trachea feels deviated
to the right.

06:36.029 --> 06:42.803
*

06:42.836 --> 06:44.071
- I need a scalpel.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.105
[alarm blaring]

06:45.138 --> 06:45.973
- We're going to treatment 5.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.140
- You got it, Maggie.
- Olga Barlow.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.709
74, lives alone.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.078
Complex cardiac history.
Called EMS for dyspnea.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.813
BP 82 over 44.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.816
Chronic A-fib at rate 105.
Tachypneic at 30.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.117
Those are her meds.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.720
- I'll page Dr. Choi.
- Okay.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.988
- Mrs. Barlow,
what happened today?

07:01.021 --> 07:05.826
- It's so hot out, I'm having
a hard time catching my breath.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.094
- Do you have an air conditioner
in the home?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.196
- Don't I wish?
- Well, let's move her.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.698
One, two, three.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.699
- Oh.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.900
- There you go.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.738
[machine beeping]

07:17.771 --> 07:18.739
- Pulse ox 89.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.741
Temperature 101.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.109
- She's tachy up to 130.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.177
I think we're looking
at heat exhaustion.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.213
Let's pack her axilla
and groin in ice

07:26.246 --> 07:29.583
and send a CBC, CMP, LFTs,
and urine.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.984
And give her an amp of D50.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.153
- What's the story?
- Non-exertional heat illness.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.855
We're going to lower her
core temp and keep her hydrated.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.123
- You check her meds?

07:36.156 --> 07:39.126
[dark music]

07:39.159 --> 07:42.162
*

07:42.195 --> 07:43.731
- Looks like she has
pulmonary hypertension.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.065
- That's right.
Jugular venous distention.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.201
That means she's
in volume overload.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.872
This fluid you ordered could've
sent her into heart failure.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.240
- Am I gonna be okay?

07:53.273 --> 07:55.008
- We're gonna take
good care of you.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.677
Let's get a chest film.
AP and lateral.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.011
ECG and stat formal echo.
- Yes, Doctor.

07:58.045 --> 08:01.014
- Start epoprostenol at two.
Dobutamine at three.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.149
Is your arthritis
causing you pain?

08:02.182 --> 08:05.018
- Yes, it's pretty bad.
- I bet.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.787
That's a pretty good dose
of oxycodone.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.022
Let's give her one--no,
two milligrams of hydromorphone.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.190
She won't even notice
one milligram.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.892
- Okay.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.027
- You're gonna be feeling
better soon.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.163
*

08:16.196 --> 08:17.064
Next time do a complete history

08:17.097 --> 08:19.867
and physical
before making a diagnosis.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.870
*

08:22.903 --> 08:24.204
- Great.
There you go.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.073
- Ms. Goodwin, a word?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.775
- Problem, Dr. Rhodes?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.109
- I filled in for trauma
last night.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.277
Seven surgeries.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.712
I was double-booked going
back and forth between ORs.

08:32.746 --> 08:33.981
- Well, a month ago
you were complaining

08:34.014 --> 08:35.649
about not having enough to do.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.049
- Well, last night
cured me of that.

08:37.083 --> 08:39.119
The hospital is over-scheduling,
Ms. Goodwin.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.655
- Well, maybe someone thought
we needed the revenue.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.090
I'll look into it.
- Thank you.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.927
- Look, we're all having
our problems today, Dr. Rhodes.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.762
Go home.
Get some sleep.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.064
- I can't, I've got a consult
on a cold leg in IR

08:51.098 --> 08:53.734
that needs
an aortalfemoral bypass.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.272
[tense music]

08:59.306 --> 09:01.008
- Retract his ribs.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.011
*

09:04.044 --> 09:05.212
Suction.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.114
*

09:07.147 --> 09:08.115
- [grunts]

09:08.148 --> 09:09.116
- All right.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.852
*

09:11.885 --> 09:13.253
- Anything?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.923
- Nothing but clots.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.691
I don't see it.
I got to get behind the lungs.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.126
- Still has a carotid pulse.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.695
*

09:21.729 --> 09:24.698
- Oh, man.
Rib perforated the aorta.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.167
- Can you clamp it?
- With what? My hand?

09:27.200 --> 09:29.870
- It'll buy us--
him 20 minutes?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.304
- Any longer there's a good
chance he'll be paralyzed.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.340
- If you don't,
he'll bleed out.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.875
- All right.

09:34.908 --> 09:40.881
*

09:40.914 --> 09:42.149
- Hemostatic?
- Yeah, it stopped.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.285
Now he needs more blood...
and a miracle.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.989
Which could happen if we get him
on portable bypass.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.190
They've been doing it in France.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.792
We have a unit
in clinical trial at Med.

09:51.825 --> 09:52.793
April, call Maggie.

09:52.826 --> 09:53.894
- On it.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.129
- We've got about 19 minutes
to get Ignacio hooked up

09:56.163 --> 09:57.931
before he's paralyzed or worse.

10:02.870 --> 10:03.003
.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.973
- Hey, I mean to ask you.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.008
Are flowers too much
for your mom tonight?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.844
- Roses tend to wilt
in her presence, but hey.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.013
Don't worry about it.
She actually canceled her trip.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.948
She's too busy.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.985
This is her idea of an apology.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.688
- 1,000 bucks?
- Mm-hmm.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.355
- I wish my mom apologized
like that.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.257
She just bakes cookies.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.259
- It takes time to bake cookies.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.930
This just took a call
to her accountant.

10:29.963 --> 10:30.931
[alarm beeping]

10:30.964 --> 10:32.866
- Code blue.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.668
[dramatic music]

10:34.702 --> 10:36.036
Code blue.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.771
*

10:37.805 --> 10:39.707
- Her tongue has relaxed,
closing off her airway.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.908
- I'll do an oral airway.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.810
[machine beeping]

10:42.843 --> 10:44.444
- I got it.
- Intubation kit?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.246
- No, two milligrams of
naloxone IV.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.815
I think this is an overdose.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.684
- Of what?
- Hydromorphone.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.685
I don't understand.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.652
She shouldn't have
had this kind of reaction.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.856
- Respiration's at 8 per minute.
- Take over?

10:55.889 --> 10:56.957
- Okay.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.727
*

10:59.760 --> 11:00.794
- Dr. Choi.

11:00.828 --> 11:01.962
Dr. Choi?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.731
- Yeah.
- I know I was off

11:03.764 --> 11:05.265
on my original diagnosis,

11:05.298 --> 11:07.100
but that won't happen again.
You can trust me.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.803
- Clark,
you're here to learn.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.339
You're gonna make
mistakes, okay?

11:12.372 --> 11:14.742
- Jeff?

11:14.775 --> 11:17.310
I need you to run this portable
bypass, Satinsky clamps,

11:17.344 --> 11:20.313
and ten units of packed cells
out to Dr. Halstead

11:20.347 --> 11:22.883
at the marathon
aid station, okay?

11:22.916 --> 11:25.953
- Run?
- You doing anything else?

11:25.986 --> 11:28.088
[electricity hums, crackles]

11:28.121 --> 11:29.322
Ugh.
- This is gonna be great.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.124
- Let's go.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.427
- Sorry it's taking so--
- I want to call Daddy.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.430
- I told you.
- Is everything okay?

11:37.464 --> 11:39.332
- When can I call him?
- He's traveling, Phoebes.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.433
You know that.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.601
- I want to go home.
- Hey.

11:41.634 --> 11:45.939
Hey, Phoebe, I promise
the CT is not gonna hurt, okay?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.975
It's just like getting
your picture taken,

11:48.008 --> 11:51.111
but in the meantime,
will you do me a favor?

11:51.144 --> 11:54.782
Can you color a picture
for the doctors' lounge?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.449
Yeah?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.451
Because of the marathon,
the hospital's way busier

11:58.485 --> 12:00.788
than usual, but
it shouldn't be too much longer.

12:00.821 --> 12:01.855
- Okay.
- And do you mind

12:01.889 --> 12:03.791
if we speak for a moment?

12:03.824 --> 12:05.826
- Sure.
- Great.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.762
- Hey. I'll be right outside,
okay, sweetie?

12:10.363 --> 12:12.365
- So you indicated
in Phoebe's chart

12:12.399 --> 12:14.001
that her father was deceased.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.169
I'm wondering why
she would want to call him?

12:19.139 --> 12:23.743
- David had a massive coronary
and died a few months ago.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.379
I haven't had the heart
to tell her.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.048
- I am so sorry.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.884
- He was away on business.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.085
I feel awful for lying,

12:32.119 --> 12:33.486
but I just know
that she'll be crushed,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.089
and I don't know
how to break it to her.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.793
- Yeah, well, you know,
we have a really great doctor

12:39.827 --> 12:42.095
that may be able
to help with that.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.964
But in the meantime,
just hang in there.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.933
We'll get Phoebe up
to CT soon, okay?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.802
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.807
- Dr. Rhodes?

12:53.841 --> 12:56.910
Dr. Halstead has a patient
in the field with a torn aorta.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.412
He's putting him
on a portable bypass.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.414
- Seriously?
A portable bypass?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.416
You can't regulate
blood flow to the brain.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.953
- Well, you can debate
the medicine with Dr. Halstead

13:05.986 --> 13:08.155
when he gets here.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.590
- Believe me, I will.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.591
[tense music]

13:11.624 --> 13:12.993
- There's blood in the tube.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.862
[crowd cheering]

13:14.895 --> 13:16.196
Saturation's 75%.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.430
- Must be
a pulmonary laceration.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.966
We got to pack his lung and get
the blood out of that tube

13:18.999 --> 13:20.167
before he drowns.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.168
- You want to pack the chest,
and I'll suction the tube?

13:21.201 --> 13:23.070
- With what free hand?
- I'll suction the tube.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.504
- I'll pack the chest.
- Give me the suction.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.974
- Noah, grab both sides,
and try to keep 'em open.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.575
- [grunts]
- My wrist is cramped up.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.077
If you let go on the ribs,
I'm done.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.478
- [grunts]

13:31.511 --> 13:32.880
- Come on, man, pull.
- I'm trying.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.481
- Hang in there.
- [grunting]

13:34.514 --> 13:36.083
- It's closing on my wrist.
I can't hold this.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.084
- Don't let go.
- Come on, Noah, pull!

13:37.117 --> 13:39.419
- Don't let go!
[grunting]

13:39.452 --> 13:41.188
- All right.
I got most of the blood.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.024
Sat's at 95%.
- Ribs, ribs, grab the ribs.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.493
- Got it.
- Guys, guys, he's here.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.095
- Sorry it took so long.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.562
Oh, man.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.531
- I need two clamps.
How long's it been?

13:51.564 --> 13:52.532
- 17 minutes.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.901
- Three to go.
Hurry up.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.869
*

14:00.540 --> 14:03.010
- Mrs. Barlow?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.178
You gave us a scare.
How are you feeling?

14:05.212 --> 14:08.281
- Oh, I'm--I'm much better,
Doctor, thank you.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.583
- Your reaction to the pain
medication surprised us,

14:10.617 --> 14:14.121
because that dose shouldn't
have been an issue for you.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.123
Have you been taking
everything as prescribed?

14:16.156 --> 14:18.491
- I didn't mention it before,
because it's--

14:18.525 --> 14:20.027
it's so embarrassing,

14:20.060 --> 14:23.196
but I accidentally spilled
some pills into the toilet,

14:23.230 --> 14:26.499
so I haven't taken everything
I was supposed to.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.902
- Mrs. Barlow, skipping doses
is very dangerous.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.203
You should have
called your doctor.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.605
- Well, I certainly know
better now.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.075
I won't let it happen again.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.944
- There's one other thing.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.913
I was reviewing your labs,
and some of the numbers indicate

14:39.947 --> 14:42.315
that you haven't been eating
as well as you should.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.552
- No one,
except my late husband,

14:45.585 --> 14:48.255
has ever accused me
of being a good cook.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.091
- Well, wait till you taste
the hospital food.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.160
- [chuckles]
- Excuse me.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.568
Dr. Charles, I have a patient
I'd like you to evaluate.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.003
She's 74, lives alone,

15:03.036 --> 15:05.238
and for some reason
hasn't been taking her meds.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.640
Her blood work indicates
she's undernourished.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.076
It might be dementia
or depression.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.278
I'm just not sure.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.645
- I'll have a little chat.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.646
Shoot me her chart?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.082
- Yeah, Olga Barlow.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.649
Treatment 5.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.120
- Oh, great.
Thank you.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.288
Paramedics are close.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.123
- All right, we're good to go.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.992
- Circuit's primed.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.996
*

15:29.029 --> 15:30.097
- Let's get some
more blood in him.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.999
- It's infusing.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.566
- Come on, Ignacio.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.136
*

15:36.169 --> 15:38.538
- And...it's up.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.273
- Time.
How long has he been clamped?

15:40.307 --> 15:42.575
- 24 minutes.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.977
- Damn.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.585
- Mrs. Barlow?
I'm Dr. Charles.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.586
How are we doing today?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.588
- Pleased to meet you,
Dr. Charles.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.557
- Dr. Choi mentioned that you
were having

15:57.590 --> 15:58.725
some trouble
with your medication,

15:58.758 --> 15:59.726
and he asked me
to look in on you.

15:59.759 --> 16:03.496
- Of course, but this is
all just a big mistake.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.597
- Tell me,

16:04.631 --> 16:06.466
how did you end up here today?

16:06.499 --> 16:09.569
- I spilled some pills and
didn't take all my medication.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.771
It's so boring.
- Huh.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.706
- Charles.
That's an English name isn't it?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.108
- Yes, it is.
- Mm.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.110
My late husband Robert
was English.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.612
He had a Charles
on his mother's side.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.248
Have you been?
- Not for a while.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.150
- Mm.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.684
Well,
when I was quite a bit younger,

16:24.717 --> 16:26.586
Robert and I took
the final voyage

16:26.619 --> 16:30.690
on the RMS "Queen Elizabeth"
across the pond from New York.

16:30.723 --> 16:31.691
- Wow.
- Yeah.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.526
- That sounds like quite a trip.
- Oh, it was.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.495
1968.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.264
There was a sense of design
back then

16:37.297 --> 16:39.532
that you just
don't see today.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.769
Now it's--it's all screens,
and technology,

16:42.802 --> 16:45.272
and people have forgotten

16:45.305 --> 16:47.607
the importance of style,
haven't they?

16:47.640 --> 16:49.042
- Boy, you can say that again.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.543
- [gasps softly]

16:50.577 --> 16:53.113
I'm sorry for
running on like that.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.149
Was there something else
you wanted to ask me?

16:56.183 --> 16:59.086
- You know,
I think that I'm all set.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.653
Thank you.
It was so nice to meet you.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.022
- It was really nice
to meet you, Dr. Charles.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.827
- So in my opinion,
Mrs. Barlow is competent

17:07.859 --> 17:09.829
and definitely
a bit of a charmer.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.832
- One who's not taking her meds
or eating properly.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.367
- Not suicidal.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.103
Not depressed as far as
I can tell.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.804
I mean, what she is,
is she's nostalgic

17:17.837 --> 17:20.540
for a more refined culture...

17:20.573 --> 17:22.842
which is a far cry
from eating cat food.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.844
- She told you she was
eating cat food?

17:24.877 --> 17:26.346
- Look at her blood work.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.682
Raised taurine level.
That's the telltale sign.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.319
- I thought she was lying about
eating regularly, but cat food?

17:32.352 --> 17:34.321
- Mm-hmm, this happens
when money's tight.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.823
You know, elderly woman.
Fixed income.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.159
She'd be way too embarrassed
to say anything.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.627
- What about dropping her pills
in the toilet?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.295
You think that's a lie too?

17:42.329 --> 17:46.166
- Oxycodone, sildenafil,
benzos all have

17:46.199 --> 17:48.201
a very high street value, buddy.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.202
- You think
this sweet old lady's

17:49.236 --> 17:50.570
selling them to get money?

17:50.603 --> 17:52.339
- Sweet old lady in need, man.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.473
I've seen it before.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.842
You know, and the sad part is,
is, even selling her meds,

17:55.875 --> 17:58.178
she doesn't seem to be
making ends meet.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.847
[dark music]

18:00.880 --> 18:01.814
[alarm blaring]

18:01.848 --> 18:04.251
- 25-year-old male.
High-velocity impact.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.653
Found with aortic
and lung lacerations from a rib.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.821
Aortic cross clamp in place.
Bleeding controlled.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.191
We've got eight units of
packed cells in the field

18:11.224 --> 18:13.393
via a portable bypass
in progress at three liters.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.862
- Portable bypass?
That your call?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.697
- It was our only option.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.366
- I got it from here.

18:19.399 --> 18:26.639
*

18:29.409 --> 18:31.778
- Sharon Goodwin,
this is Lawrence.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.346
- Wonderful to meet you.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.815
Sorry it's under
such difficult circumstances.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.651
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.187
- I don't have much time.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.754
It's a busy day for us.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.656
- I understand.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.927
Now, would you prefer
that I call you

18:47.960 --> 18:49.396
Ms. Goodwin or Sharon?

18:49.429 --> 18:52.232
- Oh, Sharon is fine.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.901
- Sharon,
before we go any further,

18:54.934 --> 18:58.405
are you sure that you
don't want to try to reconcile?

18:58.438 --> 19:00.773
While legal separation
is not a divorce,

19:00.807 --> 19:03.210
it is a big step down that road.

19:03.243 --> 19:07.214
- We're past
trying to reconcile.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.681
- I know we talked a little bit

19:08.715 --> 19:11.318
about this on the phone,
but pending court approval,

19:11.351 --> 19:13.320
you and your spouse
are agreeing to live

19:13.353 --> 19:16.789
independent of each other,
both financially and physically.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.259
- Which we have been for months.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.261
- Illinois law allows a spouse

19:21.294 --> 19:22.762
who is without fault

19:22.795 --> 19:25.365
to receive reasonable
support and maintenance

19:25.398 --> 19:26.899
while parties
are living apart.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.469
We would need to ask the court
to determine that amount.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.705
- I don't want
anything from him.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.409
- In that case,
when you're ready,

19:36.443 --> 19:41.281
I just need you to sign
at the bottom of both copies.

19:43.000 --> 19:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:52.024 --> 19:53.460
- Ms. Kastpen?
- Yes?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.728
- I'm Dr. Charles,
and this is Dr. Reese.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.764
- Nice to meet you.
- Dr. Manning mentioned

19:57.797 --> 19:59.532
that you were struggling
with how to break the news

19:59.566 --> 20:01.234
of your husband's death
to your daughter.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.002
- Oh, yes.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.036
- We were thinking
that if we all sat down,

20:04.070 --> 20:06.273
we might be able to help you
come up with a plan

20:06.306 --> 20:08.375
to--how to best
discuss this with Phoebe.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.243
- [clears throat]

20:10.277 --> 20:11.844
You know, I really appreciate
you're trying to help,

20:11.878 --> 20:13.480
but the timing
is just all wrong.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.315
Phoebe is scared enough
just being here.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.384
I can't add stress
to her right now.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.252
If you'll excuse me.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.325
- I think she's lying to us.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.760
The pause before answering,
throat clearing,

20:27.794 --> 20:29.396
and hand-to-face activity
all point

20:29.429 --> 20:31.364
to her not being truthful.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.400
- Just so you know,
all that behavioral cue stuff

20:33.433 --> 20:36.403
about how to spot liars:
bunch of hooey.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.871
Having said that...

20:38.905 --> 20:39.872
I think you're absolutely right.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.874
She's hiding something.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.877
[tense music]

20:44.911 --> 20:46.012
*

20:46.045 --> 20:48.748
- What do you think?

20:48.781 --> 20:51.584
- I think an ED doc
opened him up in the field.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.786
- Can you repair it?

20:53.820 --> 20:57.357
- Well, it's not every day
that you see a rib in the aorta,

20:57.390 --> 21:01.361
but I'm gonna try to
repair it by graft.

21:01.394 --> 21:06.032
Whether there is impaired
brain activity or paralysis...

21:06.065 --> 21:07.033
[faucet shuts off]

21:07.066 --> 21:09.569
Well, that remains to be seen.

21:09.602 --> 21:14.941
*

21:14.974 --> 21:18.478
You must be
one hell of a poker player.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.513
- Why is that?

21:20.547 --> 21:23.082
- It was a hell of a gamble.

21:23.115 --> 21:30.390
*

21:34.126 --> 21:37.597
- What's the word?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.532
We had to try.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.534
- Did we?

21:41.568 --> 21:47.006
*

21:47.039 --> 21:49.376
- Mrs. Barlow,
there are some things about

21:49.409 --> 21:50.810
your case that are puzzling.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.379
I was hoping I could ask you
a few questions.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.846
- Of course.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.114
- As I mentioned,
your labs show

21:55.147 --> 21:57.384
you're a little undernourished.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.885
I just want to make sure
you're getting enough to eat.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.421
- I am.
- Good.

22:01.454 --> 22:02.288
I'm glad to hear that,

22:02.321 --> 22:05.091
because sometimes
people skip meals

22:05.124 --> 22:06.959
when they're finding it hard
to get by.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.395
- Get by?

22:08.428 --> 22:12.098
- Well, when money's an issue.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.534
We've seen some patients
who felt they had no choice

22:14.567 --> 22:17.336
but to sell their medications.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.408
- Are you insinuating--
- No, ma'am.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.876
I'm just trying to
understand these results.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.946
- I have no need
to sell anything,

22:26.979 --> 22:30.149
and I resent the implication.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.452
- Of course.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.157
Mrs. Barlow,

22:38.190 --> 22:40.927
I just want you to know

22:40.960 --> 22:42.562
that there are
resources available for you,

22:42.595 --> 22:44.897
if you need anything.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.599
- I already told you.

22:46.633 --> 22:49.001
I just--I dropped my pills
down the toilet.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.603
That's all there is to it.

22:50.637 --> 22:53.005
- Yes, ma'am.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.642
[tense music]

22:55.675 --> 22:57.677
Forgive me.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.179
*

23:00.212 --> 23:03.650
- Olga Barlow,
you gave me such a fright.

23:03.683 --> 23:04.984
- Ruth, my hair.

23:05.017 --> 23:05.985
I look terrible.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.954
- You look fine.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.890
I've just brought you your purse

23:10.923 --> 23:14.527
and wanted to see if
there was anything you needed.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.629
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I'm her neighbor.

23:16.663 --> 23:17.930
- Hi.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.633
- And you mustn't worry
about Princess.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.034
I fed her.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.504
- I'll give you two
some privacy, Mrs. Barlow.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.506
Excuse me.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.675
- Now, what's going on?

23:28.708 --> 23:32.512
*

23:32.545 --> 23:35.114
- [sighs]

23:35.147 --> 23:37.984
She won't admit to it.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.986
- Well, I'm not surprised.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.654
People think
sex is a touchy subject.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.056
Believe me, money is
a lot touchier.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.692
*

23:45.725 --> 23:47.059
- Dr. Charles?

23:47.093 --> 23:47.994
I've been doing
a little digging

23:48.027 --> 23:50.597
into Phoebe's mother,
Michelle Kastpen.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.665
I can't find anyone in or
around Chicago with that name.

23:52.699 --> 23:55.034
- Hey.
Phoebe's CT results are back.

23:55.067 --> 23:58.705
Mom has clearly not given us
a full history.

23:58.738 --> 24:01.508
*

24:01.541 --> 24:04.611
- Ms. Kastpen,
is there any other information,

24:04.644 --> 24:07.213
anything at all,
about Phoebe's medical history

24:07.246 --> 24:08.681
that you'd like to
share with us?

24:08.715 --> 24:10.783
- Not that I can think of.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.720
- The reason we ask is that
Phoebe's CAT scans

24:13.753 --> 24:17.223
revealed several
healed skull fractures.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.662
- These explain
Phoebe's hearing loss.

24:22.695 --> 24:26.766
They're also possible indicators
of child abuse.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.101
- [sniffles]

24:29.135 --> 24:31.103
[sighs]

24:31.137 --> 24:34.574
[tense music]

24:34.607 --> 24:38.110
Wait, you think it was me?

24:38.144 --> 24:40.580
I would never do anything
to hurt Phoebe.

24:40.613 --> 24:41.814
- The way this works,
Ms. Kastpen,

24:41.848 --> 24:43.115
is that unless
you can shine some light

24:43.149 --> 24:44.450
on your daughter's injuries,

24:44.483 --> 24:47.119
we don't really have any choice
but to contact the authorities.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.055
- I would never, never--

24:49.088 --> 24:50.256
- You have to understand
how we're seeing it,

24:50.289 --> 24:52.024
from our perspective.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.594
*

24:54.627 --> 24:56.596
- It wasn't me.

24:56.629 --> 25:00.166
*

25:00.199 --> 25:02.201
I lied.
I'm divorced.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.670
It was my ex.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.305
Phoebe would get hurt
when she was with him a lot.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.307
A sprained ankle.
A broken arm.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.842
Too many things to be random.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.143
- Did you ever confront him?

25:11.177 --> 25:13.813
- I tried, but he has money.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.715
He out-lawyered me.

25:15.748 --> 25:19.719
- Oh, so it sounds to me like
your ex-husband's still alive.

25:19.752 --> 25:26.793
*

25:28.327 --> 25:30.830
- I felt powerless,
so I took her.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.298
- You kidnapped your daughter?

25:32.331 --> 25:34.701
- I had to.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.068
You can't call the police.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.304
Please.
They'll just send Phoebe back,

25:38.337 --> 25:40.640
and I don't know
what he's gonna do to her.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.341
You have to protect my daughter.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.244
Please.
Please.

25:45.277 --> 25:48.648
*

25:52.384 --> 25:54.787
- This woman has given us
a false name and admitted

25:54.821 --> 25:56.155
to kidnapping her daughter.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.356
- But I think
she's finally being honest.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.359
She is legitimately concerned
for her daughter's safety.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.161
- Just because she thinks
she's telling the truth, Doctor,

26:02.194 --> 26:04.163
doesn't necessarily mean
that she is.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.698
- Yeah, but if she is,

26:05.732 --> 26:07.299
I'd hate to tear this child
away from her mother.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.368
- It's not our job to figure out
what the truth is.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.705
If we suspect abuse,
it's our duty to report it

26:12.739 --> 26:15.808
and let the proper
authorities sort it out.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.313
[dark music]

26:21.347 --> 26:24.316
*

26:24.350 --> 26:26.318
- Hey.
Any news?

26:26.352 --> 26:28.287
- I'm headed back up to check.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.222
- We found Ignacio's family.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.323
- They're in St. Louis.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.325
Be here in four hours.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.661
*

26:34.694 --> 26:35.762
- Let's hope
it's a happy reunion.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.630
- Si, si.
In Chicago Med.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.198
[speaking Spanish]

26:39.231 --> 26:42.301
[machine beeping]

26:44.136 --> 26:47.206
[beeping]

26:51.143 --> 26:52.111
- Allow me.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.380
- Oh, thank you.

26:54.413 --> 26:55.682
Oh.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.183
Thank you, Doctor.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.385
- Ruth, wasn't it?
- Yes.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.353
- Those are beautiful earrings.
Emerald?

27:01.387 --> 27:03.322
- Oh, yes.
Thank you.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.924
- And nice bag.
I noticed the one you

27:04.957 --> 27:06.926
brought Mrs. Barlow
was a real beauty too.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.262
- Oh, well, we both have
a weakness for nice things.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.764
- Ah.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.433
The thing--never mind.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.669
Excuse me.
- No, no.

27:16.703 --> 27:17.770
What were you going to say?

27:17.804 --> 27:19.138
- Um...

27:20.306 --> 27:21.407
It just doesn't fit.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.411
How Mrs. Barlow can afford
to spend so much on a purse.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.246
- Why?

27:28.414 --> 27:29.949
- Please.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.455
I could be wrong, but I think
she's economizing on food.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.791
Not eating.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.127
- You think
Olga has financial issues?

27:41.160 --> 27:43.129
- Well, what do you think?

27:43.162 --> 27:47.767
- I don't know, but now
that you mention it...

27:47.800 --> 27:49.702
- Yes?

27:49.736 --> 27:53.439
- I was over there
for coffee last week,

27:53.472 --> 27:56.408
and when I went to get the sugar

27:56.442 --> 27:58.711
all she had were
those little packets

27:58.745 --> 28:00.780
that you get in restaurants.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.416
- Is it possible Mrs. Barlow
might feel pressure

28:04.450 --> 28:07.920
to keep up appearances with you?

28:08.855 --> 28:11.290
- Oh, dear.
I...

28:11.323 --> 28:14.827
I-I may have given Olga
the wrong impression.

28:14.861 --> 28:17.897
- How's that?

28:17.930 --> 28:21.500
- Actually,
I don't have that much.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.902
It's my son.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.905
My son sends me nice things.

28:25.938 --> 28:26.906
- Mm.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.508
[solemn music]

28:29.541 --> 28:32.411
And you never told
Mrs. Barlow that?

28:32.444 --> 28:33.512
- No.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.215
- I see you care about her,
and you want to help her.

28:36.248 --> 28:37.516
- I do.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.887
- Then please let her know
the truth.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.955
*

28:42.989 --> 28:44.456
Excuse me.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.858
- [sighs]

28:45.892 --> 28:52.865
*

28:52.899 --> 28:54.400
- Hi.
Can we speak for a moment?

28:54.433 --> 28:56.903
- Mm-hmm.

28:56.936 --> 28:57.870
You made the call.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.472
- Yes, it is our duty
in these types of cases

29:00.506 --> 29:02.474
to alert the authorities.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.410
Now may be a good time
to have a conversation

29:04.443 --> 29:06.512
with Phoebe to prepare her.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.382
- Oh, I'll get that.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.487
Well, that's a pretty drawing.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.790
- I used to color better.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.358
- Yeah?
What changed?

29:19.391 --> 29:22.361
- I don't know.

29:22.394 --> 29:27.900
*

29:27.934 --> 29:30.436
- Hey, Phoebe, you mind if
I take a look at your hands?

29:30.469 --> 29:31.971
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

29:32.004 --> 29:35.975
*

29:36.008 --> 29:40.046
All right, now, can you squeeze
my fingers as hard as you can?

29:40.079 --> 29:41.480
- What are you doing?
- Just making sure

29:41.513 --> 29:43.816
we haven't missed anything.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.384
How about with this hand?

29:45.417 --> 29:52.491
*

29:54.460 --> 29:55.461
- He hasn't woken up yet.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.997
It could be a sign
of impaired brain function.

29:58.030 --> 30:01.868
- It's too soon
to make that call.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.936
You do a Babinski?

30:03.970 --> 30:06.605
- It's your patient.
I didn't want to overstep.

30:06.638 --> 30:13.913
*

30:21.120 --> 30:28.327
*

30:30.029 --> 30:31.998
What did I do to this guy?

30:32.031 --> 30:37.469
*

30:37.503 --> 30:40.472
- Listen, Will,

30:40.506 --> 30:43.475
he's still got a good amount
of paralytic in him.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.444
He's also acidotic and cold.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.547
You can't expect
a good reaction just yet.

30:48.580 --> 30:55.621
*

31:12.338 --> 31:13.439
[knocking]

31:19.078 --> 31:20.446
- Hi.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.581
So after I observed the weakness
in Phoebe's hand,

31:22.614 --> 31:25.284
I ran some tests
on the blood work we took,

31:25.317 --> 31:27.419
and the results showed
an explanation

31:27.453 --> 31:29.021
for her hearing loss.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.557
She has a genetic condition
called osteopetrosis.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.459
- What?
- It's a bone disease

31:33.492 --> 31:35.461
that can cause progressive
hearing loss.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.029
It also explains
the carpal tunnel

31:37.063 --> 31:38.430
that's causing weakness
in her wrists.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.499
- But I don't have it,
and neither does her father.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.301
- It just means that
you and her father

31:42.334 --> 31:45.337
are both genetic carriers.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.339
- Is she gonna be deaf?

31:47.373 --> 31:49.075
- Not necessarily.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.343
We've had some success
in treating the condition

31:51.377 --> 31:53.712
with bone marrow transplants.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.381
- Okay.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.685
What aren't you telling me?

31:59.718 --> 32:02.021
- Osteopetrosis makes bones

32:02.054 --> 32:04.390
abnormally dense
and prone to breakage,

32:04.423 --> 32:08.127
which explains
her skull fractures.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.462
What I'm trying to say is,

32:10.496 --> 32:14.366
I don't think
she was ever abused.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.103
- Oh, my God.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.371
He didn't hurt her?

32:19.405 --> 32:22.374
[solemn music]

32:22.408 --> 32:24.110
What have I done?

32:24.143 --> 32:25.677
*

32:25.711 --> 32:27.746
What have I done?

32:27.779 --> 32:32.651
*

32:32.684 --> 32:35.721
- Ms. Kastpen?

32:35.754 --> 32:37.556
I'm Detective Olinski.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.758
*

32:39.791 --> 32:42.128
- What have I done?

32:42.161 --> 32:45.397
*

32:45.431 --> 32:47.766
- Still hasn't come to.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.735
- Dr. Halstead,
we saved his life.

32:49.768 --> 32:50.869
- For what?

32:50.902 --> 32:54.506
To lie like this on a ventilator
for God knows how long?

32:54.540 --> 32:55.741
- We don't know that's the case.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.176
- He's been off sedation
for an hour and a half.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.411
He should be coming around.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.580
- Okay, so let's give him
a little nudge.

33:01.613 --> 33:04.483
Flumazenil 0.2 milligrams
IV push.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.585
- Wait.
We don't know his history.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.521
If he's an alcoholic
or on a benzo, he could seize.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.057
- That's not gonna happen.
Please.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.125
- Yes, Doctor.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.594
- We need to know
his mental status.

33:15.627 --> 33:22.701
*

33:29.841 --> 33:31.677
- Hold on.

33:31.710 --> 33:37.583
*

33:37.616 --> 33:39.818
- Mr. Garza,
I'm Dr. Rhodes.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.753
You're at Chicago Med.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.622
You were in an accident.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.424
You were hit by a car.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.193
- Do you need me to translate?

33:47.226 --> 33:50.762
- Oh, no.
Thank you.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.065
[speaking Spanish]

33:56.135 --> 33:59.105
[continues in Spanish]

33:59.138 --> 34:03.575
*

34:03.609 --> 34:06.212
Good.

34:06.245 --> 34:10.116
[speaking Spanish]

34:10.149 --> 34:11.483
*

34:11.516 --> 34:13.119
Nice.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.520
You got a good grip there.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.556
- Mr. Garza, I want you
to push your foot down,

34:17.589 --> 34:20.126
like you're stepping on
the gas pedal of a car.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.592

- [speaking Spanish]

34:34.739 --> 34:41.780
*

34:49.255 --> 34:50.856
- Okay.
How about this?

34:50.889 --> 34:55.161
Mr. Garza,
can you move your toes?

34:55.194 --> 34:58.164
[speaking Spanish]

34:58.197 --> 35:03.535
*

35:03.569 --> 35:05.871
- Yes.

35:05.904 --> 35:08.740
- You're a rock star, Mr. Garza.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.576
You did great.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.911
Now we're gonna let you
get some rest.

35:12.944 --> 35:20.186
*

35:25.824 --> 35:27.826
- [sobbing]

35:27.859 --> 35:30.762
- I'm so sorry.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.898
- No, it's okay.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.733
He's okay.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.802
- Then why...?

35:36.835 --> 35:39.738
- [exhales]

35:39.771 --> 35:41.773
I'm just so relieved.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.775
*

35:43.809 --> 35:45.677
- Oh.

35:45.711 --> 35:52.751
*

35:54.853 --> 35:56.755
- Hey.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.890
Good job getting
the bypass out there.

35:58.924 --> 36:05.331
*

36:05.364 --> 36:06.898
- It's okay, baby.
- Don't go.

36:06.932 --> 36:07.966
- It's okay, baby.
- Stay.

36:07.999 --> 36:08.967
No, don't go, Mommy!
Don't go!

36:09.000 --> 36:10.836
- Baby, it's okay, it's okay.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.938
- Come back, Mom!

36:12.971 --> 36:15.841
No!
Come back, Mommy!

36:15.874 --> 36:17.343
*

36:17.376 --> 36:18.810
Mom!

36:20.279 --> 36:23.249
- She thought she was doing
the right thing.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.251
She risked everything
and lost everything

36:25.284 --> 36:27.819
to get her daughter
out of harm's way,

36:27.853 --> 36:29.688
and we're sending her to jail.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.257
- I understand why she did it,

36:31.290 --> 36:33.659
but couldn't she have had
a doctor evaluate

36:33.692 --> 36:35.261
Phoebe before going on the run?

36:35.294 --> 36:37.363
She messed up so many lives.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.830
- Yeah, but...

36:38.864 --> 36:41.333
it still feels wrong.

36:41.367 --> 36:44.002
- I know.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.773
- So this was all just about
keeping up with the Joneses.

36:47.806 --> 36:50.309
- It was a good catch, Dr. Choi.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.611
- A new one for me.

36:52.644 --> 36:53.879
Pride.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.348
It can literally kill you.

36:56.382 --> 36:59.918
- I guess sometimes
that's all we have left, right?

37:04.790 --> 37:05.891
- [laughs]

37:05.924 --> 37:07.626
Someone's happy.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.995
- Ignacio is going to make it.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.997
- Yes!
- We did that.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.300
- Man,
you really stepped up today.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.734
You impressed me out there.

37:15.767 --> 37:19.438
- Hold up.
Is--is that a compliment?

37:19.471 --> 37:20.906
'Cause as I remember it,
you were like,

37:20.939 --> 37:23.675
"Don't you even think about
putting in that chest tube."

37:23.709 --> 37:25.911
- Yeah, you know what?
I was proud of you,

37:25.944 --> 37:27.379
and now you're
just being a dick.

37:27.413 --> 37:28.947
Bye-bye.
- [laughs]

37:31.049 --> 37:32.784
- Nothing, Mom.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.787
I just wanted to say thanks
for the check.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.794
No, I-I appreciate it, Mom.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.896
I appreciate everything.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.035
All right, bye.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.937
- Seriously?

37:51.970 --> 37:53.505
I thought
you were pissed off at her.

37:53.539 --> 37:55.807
- Yeah, I was.

37:55.841 --> 37:59.311
I mean, you know, she wasn't--
she's wasn't a great mom,

37:59.345 --> 38:02.914
but she tried her best.
I realize that.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.684
- Okay.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.052
- Anyway,
I've got all this money,

38:07.085 --> 38:10.356
so where do you want to eat?

38:10.389 --> 38:11.957
I hear there's
this great place uptown

38:11.990 --> 38:14.360
with a lobster mac to die for.
- All right.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.061
- Rough day?

38:16.094 --> 38:17.529
- You could say that.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.731
- Yeah.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.368
- Wait.
I thought you had a win today?

38:22.401 --> 38:23.935
- Only thing I did right today
was double-time

38:23.969 --> 38:25.704
some heavy stuff
across the city.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.839
Same thing any grunt
could do in basic.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.975
- Jeff...

38:30.008 --> 38:32.978
whatever you did it,
it saved a life.

38:33.011 --> 38:35.046
That's something.

38:36.382 --> 38:38.083
[elevator dings]

38:50.128 --> 38:51.897
[knock at door]

38:51.930 --> 38:53.499
- Come in.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.503
- Hey, I just thought
you might like to know

38:57.536 --> 38:59.871
that Dr. Halstead's
bypass patient, he's doing well.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.507
- Oh, good.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.142
So now you can
finish your marathon shift.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.911
[chuckles]

39:05.944 --> 39:08.814
Go home, Dr. Rhodes.
Put your feet up.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.817
- Oh, actually I had something
a little different in mind.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.118
[laughs softly]

39:14.453 --> 39:16.388
What about you?

39:18.457 --> 39:20.559
- Just gonna go home.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.428
- Okay.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.865
You know,
this place I'm going, it's--

39:26.898 --> 39:30.502
it's pretty fun.

39:30.536 --> 39:32.103
Maybe you want to join me?

39:35.106 --> 39:37.909
- A few more feet, you can
officially check marathon

39:37.943 --> 39:39.811
off your bucket list.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.481
- "Officially" is
a bit of a stretch.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.149
- Hold that thought.

[poignant music]

39:46.217 --> 39:48.954
- [laughs]

39:48.987 --> 39:51.056

official than this.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.793
With a time of ten hours
and six minutes,

39:54.826 --> 39:56.194
Dr. Nina Shore

39:56.227 --> 40:00.065
has just set a new
marathon record.

40:00.098 --> 40:05.070

[upbeat Hawaiian music playing]

40:08.173 --> 40:09.140
- There it is.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.842
- Ah.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.177
Now, this is different.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.912
- Dr. Downey loved this place.

40:13.945 --> 40:17.483
He said it was as close as
you could get to the real thing.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.184
- Aloha.
- Oh.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.886
Oh, thank you.

40:20.919 --> 40:21.887

40:21.920 --> 40:23.088
It's real.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.956
- Any friend of Connor's.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.192
- Mrs. Goodwin, this is Keoni.
He owns this place.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.628
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's all mine,

40:29.661 --> 40:30.862
and it's good to see you,
brah.

40:30.896 --> 40:32.598

- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.235
[laughter]

40:37.268 --> 40:38.970
- Do you know what
"aloha" means?

40:39.004 --> 40:41.507
- Isn't that what they say
when you get off the plane?

40:41.540 --> 40:42.874
I thought it meant "welcome."

40:42.908 --> 40:44.175
- [laughs]

40:44.209 --> 40:45.644
- No?
- Not exactly.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.679
- Okay.

40:47.713 --> 40:49.180
- "Aloha" actually means

40:49.214 --> 40:53.885
"to consciously manifest life
joyously in the present."

40:53.919 --> 40:55.220
- Hmm.

40:55.253 --> 40:58.524
Well, in that case...

40:58.557 --> 40:59.625
aloha.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.593
- Aloha.

Oh, there it is.
