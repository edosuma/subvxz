00:11.080 --> 00:14.357
- Brought you a bible, Lonnie.
- A little late for saving souls, ain't it?

00:14.520 --> 00:16.989
I'd suggest Luke 21:36.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.591
"Pray always, that ye may be
accounted worthy to escape...

00:20.760 --> 00:22.035
...all these things."

00:53.800 --> 00:55.712
- What you think's in there?
- Open it up...

00:55.880 --> 00:57.553
...stick your head in, take a gander?

01:09.920 --> 01:12.389
Charliehorse, we're under attack.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.270
You've murdered my friends
and colleagues.

01:40.600 --> 01:45.117
You blackmailed a man
I hold in the highest esteem.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.717
You seem to have
a comprehensive knowledge of my life...

01:48.920 --> 01:51.515
...that you could only realize
through an association...

01:51.680 --> 01:53.990
...with someone close to me.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.514
You don't recognize me?

01:55.680 --> 01:59.469
- I wanna know who hired you.
- Gavin Pruitt was my husband.

01:59.680 --> 02:04.072
Most people think the danger
in a situation like this is the cold.

02:04.440 --> 02:08.752
The more immediate danger
is the oxygen supply.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.875
Answer my question
or you will suffocate...

02:12.040 --> 02:15.033
...long before you freeze to death.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.315
Gavin set up your tax havens
in Mauritius.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.711
When the feds got to him,
you thought he'd talk.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.112
- So you had him killed.
- I want a name.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.714
Raymond, it's Cooper.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.634
Harold, what can I do for you?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.749
- Give me back my prisoner.
- Which prisoner?

02:37.920 --> 02:40.754
You know who I'm talking about,
Reddington. Isabella Stone.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.319
She's perfectly safe.
I have every intention of returning her...

02:44.480 --> 02:47.598
...to your custody as soon
as she's given me the information I need.

02:47.760 --> 02:48.796
<i>You've gone too far.</i>

02:48.960 --> 02:51.714
I came from Main Justice.
They threatened to shut us down.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.234
<i>- They're bluffing.
- Are they?</i>

02:53.440 --> 02:56.512
From their point of view,
you're a bigger liability than an asset.

02:56.680 --> 02:59.149
Harold, what's happening here?
You sound desperate.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.080
From the beginning, this has been
about serving your agenda.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.556
I rode with that
because I genuinely believe...

03:04.720 --> 03:06.837
...this task force makes the world safer.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.872
<i>- You aren't being naive.
- You're damn right!</i>

03:09.080 --> 03:11.311
Not anymore.
Now I want a name, I want a big one.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.949
Not some independent contractor
like Stone.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.955
You can't just order up super criminals
like Chinese takeout, Harold.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.349
I want it now.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.999
The Architect.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.995
London, 2014.
A tanker loading diesel fuel explodes.

03:27.160 --> 03:31.313
Ten minutes later, a water main fails,
flooding Covent Garden.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.194
Only after authorities pumped
the water did they realize...

03:34.400 --> 03:37.871
...$100 million in diamonds had been
stolen from a nearby vault.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.351
<i>Reddington says this was the work
of The Architect who, for a price...</i>

03:41.520 --> 03:45.230
<i>...will design, construct
and execute the perfect crime.</i>

03:45.720 --> 03:47.120
Cortina, Italy, 2011.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.591
A safety cannon malfunctions,
setting off a devastating avalanche.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.352
Two weeks earlier, a Brazilian
art collector's home was broken into.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.319
<i>Nothing of value was stolen,
but panicked by the break-in...</i>

03:57.480 --> 04:01.110
<i>...the collector shipped a Caravaggio
to a secure facility in Geneva...</i>

04:01.280 --> 04:03.590
<i>...whose director would be killed
in the avalanche.</i>

04:03.800 --> 04:06.360
<i>The man who signed
for the old master was an imposter...</i>

04:06.520 --> 04:08.113
<i>...and the Caravaggio disappeared.</i>

04:08.280 --> 04:10.590
<i>Reddington says
The Architect's in Philadelphia...</i>

04:10.760 --> 04:14.231
...recruiting hackers at an underground
gathering called Black Mass 13.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.911
- Sounds like a slasher movie.
- More like a ghost story.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.750
Black Mass is where the worst
of the worst compete...

04:20.920 --> 04:22.957
...to see who can hack security measures.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.839
The winner is supposed to be hired.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.834
The type of gig that you don't
come back from with a soul.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.437
CP, industrial sabotage,
real horror-show stuff.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.593
Multiple hits
on a hexadecimal embedded...

04:34.760 --> 04:37.195
...in postings containing
the words "black"...

04:37.360 --> 04:39.875
..."mass" and "thirteen."

04:40.040 --> 04:43.317
And we have...
We have a GPS coordinate...

04:43.480 --> 04:44.755
...in Philadelphia.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.718
- The location of the convention?
- Nope.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.032
This is just the first step
down the rabbit hole.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.875
<i>All right, guys.
Look for anything out of the ordinary.</i>

05:01.360 --> 05:02.476
Hey, Keen.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.760
"If foo equals first object oriented."

05:15.960 --> 05:17.838
Enter "then bar"...

05:18.320 --> 05:19.674
<i>...then an equal sign...</i>

05:19.880 --> 05:23.396
...then the words
"binary arbitrary reason."

05:23.560 --> 05:24.960
Totally what I was gonna say.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.640
- 1955 South Hartford, Havertown.
- What are we gonna do there?

05:32.800 --> 05:36.430
It's all about pattern recognition.
Just... Just keep your eyes open.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.838
Hey, did you talk to Richard Game?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.674
- No. But I think I was wrong.
- About what?

05:48.840 --> 05:50.832
<i>- Game confessed to killing you.
- He's dead.</i>

05:51.000 --> 05:53.754
Turns out his mother's still alive.
So I'm gonna see her...

05:53.920 --> 05:56.674
- ...maybe she has answers.
- Wait, what were you wrong about?

05:56.840 --> 05:58.991
<i>I didn't care
what Richard Game had to say...</i>

05:59.160 --> 06:01.755
...till I found out he was dead,
now it's all I wanna know.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.440
Who my father was, who I was...

06:03.600 --> 06:05.956
...why someone wanted the world
to think I was dead.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.316
<i>That's why I was wrong,
saying it didn't matter.</i>

06:08.480 --> 06:10.756
But you were right, it does.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.991
<i>I'll call you if I find anything out.</i>

06:18.000 --> 06:19.753
- We're here.
- You see anything weird?

06:19.920 --> 06:22.355
I'm not loving the idea
of a rabbit-food smoothie...

06:22.520 --> 06:23.954
...but other than that, no.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.349
Can you send me a photo?

06:32.520 --> 06:34.637
Okay, I got it.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.750
I'll have a penny candy, please.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.474
Thank you.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.270
Oh, my God. There are so many
combinations, this is gonna take hours.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.874
Here, let me see that.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.072
How long did that take?

07:05.040 --> 07:07.475
- Agent Ressler, a word?
- I'll give this to Aram.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.756
Found an SD chip.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.435
Aram should be able to use it
to locate the Black Mass.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.834
Reven Wright...

07:15.000 --> 07:16.753
...was my superior and my friend.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.631
So I don't like this more than you,
but the inquiry into her disappearance...

07:20.800 --> 07:23.520
Reven didn't disappear,
she was murdered by Laurel Hitchin.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.115
- We know that.
- The inquiry's being shut down.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.919
The president's
national security advisor is a murderer.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.437
There's no evidence to that.
No witnesses, no prints, no case.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.200
The head of the justice division
doesn't just disappear.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.000
But until we can prove it,
the case is closed.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.520
Okay, I got something.
It's a pickup point, I think.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.400
248 Garfield, 3:20 p.m., it says:

07:45.560 --> 07:49.190
- "Come alone and wear a yellow hat."
- We need to get an agent to that pickup...

07:49.400 --> 07:51.517
...to get into Black Mass
to ID The Architect.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.240
But whoever we send in
would have to know their stuff.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.551
Not just the programming,
but the buzz words...

07:56.720 --> 07:59.155
...the culture, it's gonna...

08:02.520 --> 08:05.877
- No, I can't. Not after last time.
- You were amazing last time.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.509
Which part? Getting beaten
by my psycho girlfriend...

08:08.680 --> 08:12.117
...or screaming our safe word like
a baby who needs his diaper changed?

08:12.280 --> 08:15.990
The Architect is a mass murderer.
This is our only chance to catch him.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.992
We need you to do this.

08:36.919 --> 08:37.956
We're hot.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.792
Well...

08:50.960 --> 08:53.919
...I believe that will do the job...

08:54.080 --> 08:55.799
...quite nicely.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.431
Are you getting the CCTV feeds?

09:02.640 --> 09:06.919
Okay, we have eyes. Yellow hat,
gray blazer. Very handsome.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.072
And the TAC team is standing by?

09:09.240 --> 09:11.800
They'll be in place as soon as you give us
a location for the Black Mass site.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.350
So when I ID The Architect,
they'll breach, right?

09:15.520 --> 09:17.079
All right, here we go.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.599
Put this on.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.674
Now. Let's go.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.874
We're right here with you,
we're not going anywhere.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.874
There's a man I know
who works as a docent...

09:46.040 --> 09:50.273
...in a small museum in the northwest.
He recently remarried.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.712
Rotary Tuesdays, Euchre Fridays.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.792
A modest but happy life.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.675
Gavin and I played Euchre...

10:00.040 --> 10:01.440
...before you killed him.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.279
Gavin was a brilliant accountant...

10:05.720 --> 10:08.315
...and an even better man...

10:09.040 --> 10:10.759
...who worshiped you.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.429
When the feds came asking questions...

10:13.600 --> 10:16.559
...about the nature
of his relationship with me...

10:16.760 --> 10:18.240
...his only thoughts...

10:18.400 --> 10:22.189
...were about whether you
and your children would be safe...

10:22.360 --> 10:24.352
...and well-provided for.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.190
- This person you described.
- I didn't kill your husband.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.876
I helped him walk away
from everything he loved...

10:32.040 --> 10:36.432
...to protect you and your innocence.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.554
Ironic.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.073
Where is he?

10:41.960 --> 10:43.633
Who hired you?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.680
I got an anonymous package...

10:46.840 --> 10:48.638
...detailing...

10:48.800 --> 10:52.953
...files about every aspect
of your operations...

10:53.120 --> 10:55.635
- And your payment?
- I received a credit stick.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.832
It's in my apartment. It's in the...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.799
The lining of a red silk dress.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.160
Now. My husband.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.957
Where is he?

11:07.720 --> 11:09.598
He's married.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.236
He remembers you as you were.

11:12.440 --> 11:16.957
To show him what you've become
would be devastating.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.112
I'm not gonna tell you where he is.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.073
But I will turn the heat up.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.352
You must be chilled to the bone.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.391
Aram, we're tracking you
through Lexington Park.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.120
You're going northeast on Algon Avenue.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.320
What's going on?

11:33.880 --> 11:36.679
- Bring up another camera.
- It's some sort of jamming software.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.440
Aram. Aram.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.914
Aram. Cough twice if you can hear me.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.591
Contact Tactical Aviation. Give them specs
on the van, a radius to work with.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.956
I want surveillance images
within 10 minutes.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.593
Who are you?

12:06.320 --> 12:09.313
Miss Lucy Game?
My name is Frank Carraro.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.836
If I could just have a moment,
it's about your son.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.716
- My son is dead. Have some respect.
- I'm with the Innocent Project...

12:15.920 --> 12:19.277
...we believe your son spent time in prison
for a crime he did not commit.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.999
His name was Christopher Hargrave.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.150
Yeah, I remember.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.551
Before he confessed,
did he talk to anyone?

12:28.720 --> 12:31.394
A lawyer or his cellmate?
Did anyone approach him?

12:31.600 --> 12:34.593
You obviously didn't know my boy.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.559
Richard killed a lot of people.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.474
Took them apart in the garage out back.

12:40.640 --> 12:45.237
Did things to them I'll never forget.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.470
Finding out what really happened at
this point would make a huge difference...

12:49.640 --> 12:51.677
...to the people
who cared about Christopher.

12:51.840 --> 12:56.756
Your services had better be used
for someone who doesn't belong in prison.

12:58.160 --> 13:02.234
Richard never belonged anywhere else.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.073
Just wait right here.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.398
All right, move.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.916
Wait right here.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.671
You looking for work?

13:37.840 --> 13:40.878
You know, if the job's right.

13:41.040 --> 13:44.158
What do you know
about batch credit-card spoofing?

13:44.320 --> 13:48.200
I've done some, you know,
for cartels mostly.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.711
Not that you look like you work
for a cartel.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.111
Maybe you do, how...?
How would I know?

13:54.280 --> 13:58.240
I'm... Excuse me,
I think I see an old friend. Yes.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.593
Excuse me.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.672
Aren't you supposed to be in jail?

14:07.840 --> 14:09.035
Now's not a good time.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.880
Oh, really? I'm sorry.
Am I inconveniencing you?

14:12.080 --> 14:13.434
I said, not now.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.951
Five minutes to HackStar.

14:19.120 --> 14:22.511
Nut up and get your hack on.

14:23.920 --> 14:28.119
Whoa, not a piggy-backed
SQL injection like a rank amateur.

14:28.680 --> 14:31.149
Getting tense.
Getting tense. Getting tense.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.154
Come on, wizards.
Second prize is a set of steak knives.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.630
Third prize is your picture
on a milk carton.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.074
Come on. Come on. Come on.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.079
Yes, take that, "biatch."

14:46.280 --> 14:52.470
All right, all right, all right. We have
a new heavyweight champion of the world.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.592
If they find out that we work
for the government, we're dead.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.355
What do you mean, we?

15:09.520 --> 15:12.718
Fifty-one point three seconds. Excellent.

15:13.640 --> 15:18.112
Do you really think that the feds are
gonna let a prodigy like me rot in jail?

15:18.520 --> 15:19.874
Is that a remote code cipher?

15:20.040 --> 15:22.635
- Are you stealing proprietary ideas?
- Why do you think I'm here?

15:22.800 --> 15:25.554
I had three agencies fighting
a cage match to cut a deal with me...

15:25.720 --> 15:27.120
...before your girlfriend finished
reading my rights.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.119
- She is not my girlfriend.
- Oh, you're pathetic.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.915
Wait, wait, wait.
Who won that cage match?

15:33.080 --> 15:34.878
The NSA. Who do you think?

15:35.040 --> 15:37.077
- The NSA? Are you kidding me?
- Come on.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.992
Three point seven seconds
ahead of schedule.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.198
- Who...? Who the hell are you?
- Doesn't matter who I am, Mr. Patel.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.875
What matters is I would very much
like to speak...

15:47.040 --> 15:49.032
...to the young man
who won your contest.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.514
I don't know where he is.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.513
How tragic.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.036
Find him.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.753
On the odd chance
I don't have it already...

16:13.920 --> 16:16.674
...may I have your attention, please?

16:16.840 --> 16:18.320
Everyone.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.794
Find a terminal.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.430
There's something I need you to do.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.749
That's all we're getting?

16:34.920 --> 16:38.038
Techs can't figure out how
their encrypted feeds are being hacked.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.759
The Architect's got us flying blind.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.914
Not quite. The blackout is specific
to this six-square-block area...

16:44.080 --> 16:45.753
...where he doesn't want us to look.

16:45.920 --> 16:49.470
Which means Black Mass is
in there somewhere. And so is Aram.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.117
Keen, find out what he wants.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.631
Ressler, Navabi, get a team on site.
We breach on Agent Mojtabai's signal.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.473
I need to speak with Aram.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.279
Do you know
where they're holding Black Mass?

17:00.440 --> 17:03.353
- It's urgent, Lizzy.
- Because we don't and that's where he is.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.069
What do you want?

17:06.240 --> 17:08.630
To direct you
to a warehouse in Annapolis...

17:08.839 --> 17:11.674
...operated by Newcastle Ice.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.439
Are you offering me free ice?

17:13.599 --> 17:16.354
An ice queen. Isabella Stone.
Returned as promised.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.512
Did she tell you
who paid her to attack you?

17:18.720 --> 17:21.598
Only that we share the same bank.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.276
One that guarantees
its depositors' absolute privacy.

17:25.480 --> 17:29.872
I was hoping Aram could pull aside
that veil of secrecy.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.430
Help us locate Black Mass and he can.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.672
As I told Harold
when he browbeat me for a Blacklister...

17:35.840 --> 17:39.231
...I'm otherwise occupied
and in no position to assist.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.518
Sending Aram
after The Architect was reckless.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.479
His absence complicates matters for me.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.599
I'll inform Main Justice
the minute we have Stone in custody.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.638
Find out if that appeases them.

17:50.840 --> 17:55.631
And why you want to appease them
so badly, will we ever find that out?

17:59.760 --> 18:03.071
- Who is that guy?
- I don't know. My job was to ID him.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.993
Okay, and then what?

18:05.160 --> 18:08.119
- The cavalry was supposed to come.
- Tell me you have a Plan B.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.795
Yeah, I'm working on it, Elise.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.680
Whatever you're calling yourself
this week.

18:19.640 --> 18:23.634
A U.S. power grid has never been
compromised by hackers...

18:23.800 --> 18:25.553
...for one reason.

18:25.720 --> 18:30.636
It requires the combined skills of people
who are unwilling to work together.

18:31.960 --> 18:37.274
Today, you will work together unwillingly.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.558
The Architect's gonna have exits covered,
but the mercs have radios.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.992
And if I can get one and I can get
to the roof, I can notify the FBI.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.232
The roof? Please tell me
you just said that to impress me.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.754
If you think you're that hot...

18:49.360 --> 18:51.158
Well, you are. But I don't care.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.870
What I do care about is the lives
of the people out there. So just...

18:55.040 --> 18:58.238
Okay, I need...
I need something that burns.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.393
Oh, crap, come on. This is wet.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.794
Don't blow this.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.991
This damn scarf.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.476
Hey.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.038
Was any of it real?

19:18.680 --> 19:20.160
It wasn't personal.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.232
What we did at night with the lights off?

19:24.040 --> 19:25.679
That was personal.

19:27.560 --> 19:31.634
The way you let me feel about you.
I can't think of anything more personal.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.594
Hey.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.315
Aram.

19:38.480 --> 19:42.474
Whatever it is that you're planning,
I've personally kicked your ass.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.120
You'll get yourself killed.

19:44.280 --> 19:49.560
So help or don't. I don't care.
Just get out of my way.

19:52.680 --> 19:57.835
Groups one and three.
Commence your DDoS attack now.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.515
Groups two and four, 10 seconds.

20:00.720 --> 20:04.077
Without the contest winner,
our plan fails. Find him.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.354
Sierra Two, sitrep.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.549
Negative contact, leader.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.913
Group two and four, now.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.319
Let me guess.
You were gonna clock me from behind?

20:23.480 --> 20:24.834
No.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.320
She was.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.794
There's gotta be sewer access
in the sub-basement.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.395
- It's not too late to join me.
- To run?

20:48.600 --> 20:49.750
I'm not gonna do that.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.639
You do you, man.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.837
Prepare to run your rootkit scripts.

20:55.360 --> 20:59.877
Three, two, one...

21:00.040 --> 21:01.269
...execute.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.039
Ready for your big day, Lonnie?

21:08.040 --> 21:10.760
I do believe I am, warden.

21:13.880 --> 21:18.796
Break emergency. Requesting
an emergency auto patch relay to 911.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.592
<i>- You see the mother?
- Dead end.</i>

21:21.800 --> 21:23.393
She thinks he got what he deserved.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.995
Emergency patch
from switching control. It's Aram.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.992
I have to go, but I'll make a few calls.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.073
- See what I can find out. This isn't over.
- Aram?

21:31.240 --> 21:33.436
The Architect
has control of the convention.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.233
I count six mercs, heavily armed.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.153
<i>- Where are you?
- I don't know exactly.</i>

21:37.320 --> 21:40.279
I'm gonna switch this radio to tone
so you can trace my signal.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.836
Aram, Agents Ressler
and Navabi are in the area.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.798
<i>- We're on our way.
- Okay, they're here.</i>

21:47.600 --> 21:48.875
Hands, keep them up!

21:49.400 --> 21:50.720
Keep them up.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.477
Find where he is,
get the location to Ressler.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.279
Tell him to breach.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.879
Well...

22:02.040 --> 22:04.509
You're a man of many skills, Mr...?

22:05.920 --> 22:08.958
Well, whoever you are,
I need those skills.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.960
Count me out.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.160
Like him?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.832
I know who you are.

22:30.320 --> 22:33.074
And that you're willing to kill me
if you have to.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.039
But you don't know who I am.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.074
I am not someone
who's gonna help you commit a crime.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.479
I'm not gonna help you.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.276
- Samar.
- He's got a grenade!

23:03.480 --> 23:04.834
Get down, grenade!

23:23.600 --> 23:25.319
Liz, hey. What'd you find?

23:25.480 --> 23:29.360
When Richard Game confessed
to your murder, he'd been sick for years.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.910
He had a virus called Jenkins-Fowler.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.834
- So what?
- So it's incredibly contagious.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.719
He lived under constant quarantine.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.997
Somebody talked Game
into taking the fall for my murder.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.834
His phone calls were monitored,
his letters were screened.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.720
Every interaction was supervised
by prison doctors.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.634
- So maybe it's one of them.
- Or maybe it's the one person...

23:47.800 --> 23:50.793
...allowed unsupervised visitation
with Game.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.395
- His mother.
- She lied to me.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.870
The team breached.
There's been an explosion.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.080
Thanks.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.640
No sign of Aram.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.235
- Must've been taken hostage.
- Which means he's alive.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.835
For how long?
We've no leads on The Architect's plan.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.992
Aram is the plan.

24:08.160 --> 24:11.597
- Where is he?
- Case number 91170086.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.314
<i>U.S. Government v. Janet Sutherland.</i>

24:13.480 --> 24:16.632
You might wanna look that up
before pulling the trigger.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.999
- You've gotta be kidding me. All right.
- She cut a deal?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.629
Full immunity.
Cooper sent over the plea agreement.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.280
She's now an asset for the NSA.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.153
You said Aram is the plan.
What did you mean?

24:27.360 --> 24:28.555
He won a contest.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.235
It was an audition
to hack a tranche of software.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.471
- I couldn't crack it.
- Software for what?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.200
A control panel for some sort of facility.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.432
Sensor systems,
RFID tracking, security doors.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.115
- Do you know where?
- The Architect made them launch...

24:42.280 --> 24:44.840
...a cyber-attack on a power grid
in Southern Virginia.

24:45.040 --> 24:48.272
- Where in Southern Virginia?
- I don't know.

24:48.440 --> 24:51.319
Look around though.
This guy kills people.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.949
Once he gets what he needs,
he's gonna kill Aram too.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.512
I know you said you didn't wanna
be disturbed, but you have a guest.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.433
- Not now.
- He said it's urgent.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.877
I wouldn't have come
if the circumstances weren't extraordinary.

25:11.360 --> 25:13.670
Turn back. Don't move.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.878
David, I need you to help me identify
a depositor at the bank.

25:17.040 --> 25:20.238
- You know the rules.
- Yes, and I have great respect for them.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.392
Then you know I can't help you.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.994
Besides, I'm busy.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.358
David, an account holder
at your bank has stolen my money...

25:27.520 --> 25:30.718
...damaged my businesses
and killed my associates.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.230
I have the credit stick
the depositor used...

25:33.400 --> 25:37.076
...to finance this bit of nastiness,
but the data is encrypted...

25:37.240 --> 25:40.278
...and I can't access it.
I need your help. I need a name.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.715
Is my jacket puckering?

25:43.760 --> 25:45.035
I need a name.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.078
Come on. Move over.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.191
You know who the depositors are.
Complete privacy.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.875
David, please.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.919
Perhaps you don't recognize Polpetto.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.595
The man is one of the great living artists.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.080
He rarely does portraits.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.597
He's very selective
in who he portrays with his brush.

26:05.760 --> 26:09.310
David, it's a painting.
What I'm talking about is life and death.

26:09.480 --> 26:14.191
The last three paintings he's done,
one is hanging in the Whitney...

26:14.360 --> 26:17.558
...one is in the Tate Modern,
one is in the Pompidou.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.673
I could be hanging in the Pompidou...

26:20.840 --> 26:24.231
...if you would just get
the hell out of my house.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.320
Now go, please.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.760
I owe you an apology.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.991
- You can't come in here.
- I lied to you.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.913
- Get out.
- I'm not Frank Carraro...

26:38.080 --> 26:40.151
...with Project Innocence.
I'm Christopher Hargrave.

26:40.320 --> 26:43.392
The boy you convinced your son
to say he killed.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.395
- I'll call the police.
- I know about the quarantine...

26:46.560 --> 26:49.758
...his illness. You were the only one
who had unsupervised visitation.

26:49.960 --> 26:53.271
- I am warning you.
- How much were you paid? By who?

26:58.760 --> 27:03.755
You had a sick son
who committed unspeakable crimes.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.759
Letter come.

27:10.840 --> 27:11.910
Special delivery.

27:12.280 --> 27:15.751
Return address was a P.O. Box
in New York.

27:15.920 --> 27:19.436
A hundred thousand dollars.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.435
If Richard said
he did something he didn't.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.876
Your son gave the cops details...

27:25.080 --> 27:28.118
...about what happened to me.
Things that weren't in the papers.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.717
I got a script.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.519
What Richard was supposed to say.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.715
Do you still have it?

27:56.960 --> 27:58.599
The Architect.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.913
According to Reddington,
he designs, constructs and executes...

28:02.080 --> 28:03.150
...the perfect crime.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.312
You know what he wants
in Southern Virginia?

28:05.480 --> 28:06.709
<i>Greenville Correctional Facility.</i>

28:06.880 --> 28:08.872
<i>One of the most secure prisons
in America.</i>

28:09.080 --> 28:12.710
<i>Home to Virginia's death row, which is
why they sent Lonnie Perkins there.</i>

28:12.920 --> 28:14.513
<i>- The cop killer.
- And president...</i>

28:14.680 --> 28:16.433
<i>...of the Aryan Revolutionary Council.</i>

28:16.600 --> 28:19.593
The biggest white supremacist gang
in the prison system.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.031
Perkins is scheduled
to be executed tonight.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.671
- This is all about breaking him out?
- The ARC is the kind of organization...

28:25.840 --> 28:28.150
...that'd have the resources
to hire The Architect.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.676
Even if he took control
of the prison's systems...

28:30.840 --> 28:33.196
...they're not just gonna let
Perkins walk out.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.760
What's the ace up his sleeve?

28:34.920 --> 28:37.799
On my signal you will execute
a remote takeover...

28:37.960 --> 28:41.112
...of the software controlling
the internal operations of the prison.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.392
Any idea how many firewalls are built
into a system like that?

28:44.560 --> 28:46.040
Twenty-six.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.551
All disabled. Thanks to a statewide
blackout we created.

28:49.720 --> 28:53.714
Even if that's true, the operating system
is physically segregated from the Internet.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.873
Only way anyone could communicate
with the software...

28:57.040 --> 29:01.557
Is if someone inside the prison
installed a back door.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.154
I'd like the door open, please.

29:15.320 --> 29:18.518
In case any of our visitors feel
the need to step out for air.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.594
It's locked.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.595
<i>Warden McCaslin,
honored guests of the state...</i>

29:25.760 --> 29:28.992
...please direct your attention
to Guard Tower 5.

29:36.640 --> 29:40.156
Three, two, one.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.155
It's gone. The tower is gone.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.236
What happened?

30:10.320 --> 30:11.720
The breakout. It's started.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.234
What did Cooper say?

30:13.400 --> 30:15.790
A guard tower in Greenville
has just been destroyed.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.195
Any news about Aram?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.356
That was your second guard tower,
warden.

30:26.520 --> 30:31.436
For the sake of those in the third,
I do hope I have your attention.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.552
God, I love the smell of oil paints.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.273
Almost more than gasoline.

30:46.440 --> 30:49.194
Why are there certain toxic smells...

30:49.360 --> 30:51.511
...that just grab you that way?

30:51.680 --> 30:53.831
What is this? What do you want?

30:54.360 --> 30:56.920
<i>Como si dice "kidnapping"?</i>

30:58.800 --> 31:01.156
- You speak Italian?
- There was a girl.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.153
Of course there was.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.392
Tell Polpetto that I'm a great admirer
of his work.

31:06.560 --> 31:10.236
Not so much his nudes.
They're a hair splayed for my taste...

31:10.400 --> 31:14.360
...and that I do apologize,
but I require his services.

31:18.120 --> 31:21.591
<i>What you are witnessing, warden,
are solid titanium rods...</i>

31:21.760 --> 31:23.797
<i>- ...traveling at Mach 7.
- Who are you?</i>

31:23.960 --> 31:25.474
Not important who I am.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.950
What's important is
that I have control of your prison.

31:28.120 --> 31:32.319
Once you release Lonnie Perkins,
I will return that control to you.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.439
<i>- That isn't gonna happen.
- The next rod will strike the room...</i>

31:35.600 --> 31:37.273
<i>...where you and your guests are.</i>

31:37.440 --> 31:40.274
You have 30 seconds, warden,
to release Perkins.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.117
The whole prison's locked down.
All personnel.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.397
Sounds like you don't have much
of a choice.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.911
I can have that man put a needle
in your arm.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.356
I go down, you're going down with me.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.960
- Target acquired.
- Prepare to fire on my mark.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.318
Please, you can't do this.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.434
Last chance, warden.

32:06.600 --> 32:10.435
<i>Mach 7 leaves very little time
for equivocation.</i>

32:15.960 --> 32:17.155
Let him go.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.630
It's Cooper.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.235
<i>Intersection of Mesa and Ridgeline.
Get there now.</i>

32:26.400 --> 32:28.790
- We have a location for The Architect?
- And Aram.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.316
He's using a device he got
from Janet Sutherland.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.711
- That bitch?
- She's sitting right here.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.916
Hey, Samar.

32:35.080 --> 32:38.960
Turns out your boyfriend picked up
the remote code cipher during the attack.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.351
<i>It's meant to transmit data,
which it's doing now.</i>

32:41.560 --> 32:44.029
The data is meaningless,
but the signal is traceable.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.759
He's sending an SOS.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.673
<i>At the end of the hall is a door.</i>

32:47.840 --> 32:51.675
<i>Once you pass through,
turn left to 1A yard.</i>

32:51.840 --> 32:52.876
Cycle Gate 13.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.520
<i>Turn left. Proceed 20 feet.</i>

33:02.680 --> 33:07.072
<i>Two doors later
you'll see Inprocessing. Turn right.</i>

33:16.400 --> 33:17.720
Open the gate.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.710
If I set him free,
more innocent people will die.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.918
- Just open the gate.
- Please, don't.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.231
- What is that?
- Oh, that's... I don't...

33:27.440 --> 33:29.033
I don't... No. No, please. Please.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.476
- What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing. I...

33:31.640 --> 33:34.872
If you shoot me,
you'll never be able to open the gate.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.317
- Just do it now.
- Yes, sir.

33:59.800 --> 34:00.836
You can't do this.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.433
I already have.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.510
No, no, no.

34:27.679 --> 34:28.955
Watch him. He's getting away!

34:30.679 --> 34:33.320
Don't let him get away! No.

34:34.320 --> 34:38.473
Alert local authorities. A black Suburban
is going up Ridgeline Avenue, southwest.

34:38.679 --> 34:40.672
If he leaves now, we lose him for good.

34:41.400 --> 34:42.675
What are you doing?

34:43.440 --> 34:47.228
He escapes, more people die.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.510
Polpetto.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.954
What are you doing?
Did Randolf let you in?

35:29.680 --> 35:32.957
- Reddington.
- Oh, my goodness, this is tedious.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.316
I'd give almost anything
to have a scratch.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.278
But given your profession, David...

35:37.440 --> 35:41.070
...you're more inclined to squeeze them
rather than scratch, I won't impose.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.634
I'll wait for the next break.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.516
What's he...?
Why is he painting your portrait?

35:45.680 --> 35:47.512
I only brought him here to leverage you.

35:47.680 --> 35:52.118
To kill him unless you give me the name
of the depositor who has declared war...

35:52.280 --> 35:57.071
...but once I properly introduced myself,
the little fellow just lit right up.

35:57.240 --> 36:00.597
I didn't fly him all the way here
to paint your...

36:01.560 --> 36:03.552
Where is my portrait?

36:03.760 --> 36:05.319
He needed the canvas.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.234
Turns out, he's a huge fan
of spaghetti westerns.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.073
The anti-hero, the outlaw, you know.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.550
That's quite enough. Out.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.519
Please, my boy.

36:18.680 --> 36:21.673
Just a few hours with the man.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.672
He's a legend.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.359
He is the sweetest man.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.830
It'll break my heart
to put a bullet in his head...

36:32.040 --> 36:37.354
...but that will happen unless you tell me
who at your bank is coming after me.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.160
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.074
In fact, what better way
to assure my place in history?

36:42.240 --> 36:46.359
The last portrait by a master,
unfinished, killed by his subject.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.115
And you without a portrait at all.
It's a shame.

36:49.280 --> 36:54.071
My business is based
on absolute privacy.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.516
Okay, okay, okay. Just stop.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.039
Give me the stick and I'll look into it.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.479
But you have to promise, please...

37:05.920 --> 37:08.151
...spare the man's life.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.075
We'll see how the portrait turns out.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.713
For Agent Ressler.

37:15.640 --> 37:16.994
Hey.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.755
Case files
on Reven Wright's disappearance.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.389
I thought Cooper said
that inquiry was closed.

37:26.560 --> 37:28.472
Not to me, it isn't.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.712
Just got off with the D.C. Field Office.

37:31.880 --> 37:36.159
Perkins and the driver were stopped
on I-274. They're in custody now.

37:36.320 --> 37:39.279
- I told you, you would be amazing.
- You don't have to say that.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.718
It's true.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.516
I killed a man today.

37:51.760 --> 37:55.436
And by killing him,
I prevented us from interrogating him.

37:55.600 --> 37:59.230
From getting information
on his other cases and clients.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.550
Victims.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.633
Aram, you did the right thing.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.391
She's the reason
we were able to find you.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.117
Hey, Janet.

38:18.520 --> 38:21.991
I'm probably only alive because of you...

38:22.160 --> 38:23.640
...so thank you for that.

38:24.840 --> 38:28.072
It doesn't make up for... You know.

38:31.320 --> 38:33.277
You should go.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.675
Hey. Aram?

38:43.240 --> 38:45.197
I am sorry.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.720
Don't.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.516
The mother?

39:04.680 --> 39:07.275
She was paid 100,000
to convince her son to confess.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.875
She admitted it. That's great.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.556
Who paid her?

39:11.720 --> 39:13.154
She doesn't know.

39:13.320 --> 39:16.154
- How is that possible?
- She was paid in cash.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.040
Half came with the script,
half after Game was convicted.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.398
- A script?
- It has every detail.

39:22.560 --> 39:26.793
The color of the beach house.
The tear in the screen door.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.031
The knife block
where the murder weapon was.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.510
- The pajamas you were wearing.
- Yeah.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.916
The night-light in the hall.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.113
Is any of this accurate?

39:37.280 --> 39:40.079
It has to be, right?
I mean, I don't remember any of it.

39:40.240 --> 39:44.280
You should show this to your mother.
She probably knows something.

39:45.040 --> 39:48.158
Her pain about losing
her son seems real...

39:48.360 --> 39:50.750
...but Reddington says I can't trust her.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.196
That if I tell her I'm her son...

39:53.360 --> 39:55.829
...I'll never get the answers
I'm looking for.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.391
Based on this, it seems like
the only way you will is if you do.

39:59.560 --> 40:01.677
I just want to know,
what was there to gain...

40:01.840 --> 40:03.672
...from me disappearing?

40:03.880 --> 40:07.191
And why was it so important
that someone confess to my murder?

40:08.080 --> 40:09.639
And whoever wrote this...

40:10.000 --> 40:12.196
...what could they possibly want?

40:15.920 --> 40:16.956
Yeah?

40:22.560 --> 40:26.679
Harold, it troubles me
that you're dissatisfied...

40:26.840 --> 40:28.718
...with the results of our efforts.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.750
Doing good for selfish reasons
doesn't make you good.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.037
It just makes you good at being selfish.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.631
I'm sorry about your daughter.

40:41.840 --> 40:45.470
You've never spoken of her around me,
which, of course, I understand...

40:45.640 --> 40:49.270
...but you've seemed anxious of late.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.238
When someone you love is sick...

40:53.400 --> 40:57.030
...you don't need to shoulder
that burden alone.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.351
My daughter isn't a burden.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.199
She's my greatest blessing.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.833
I appreciate your concern...

41:05.280 --> 41:07.636
...but she's none of your business.

41:13.520 --> 41:16.319
You want to know why
those closest to you betray you?

41:17.000 --> 41:19.231
Why you're alone and hunted?

41:19.680 --> 41:22.354
It's because even when you try
to do something good...

41:22.520 --> 41:26.639
...you cannot seem to understand
where your selfishness ends...

41:26.800 --> 41:29.269
...and other people's lives begin.

41:30.040 --> 41:34.114
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going home to people who love me.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.320
Raymond.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.075
It's Levine.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.556
David.

41:46.720 --> 41:51.636
Is this some kind of test? See if I
would violate client confidentiality?

41:51.800 --> 41:52.916
What'd you find?

41:53.080 --> 41:54.116
You know what I found.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.277
David, the name of the account holder...

41:56.440 --> 41:59.239
...who paid Isabella Stone. Who is it?

41:59.400 --> 42:01.198
It's you, Raymond.

42:01.360 --> 42:04.637
The money came
from one of your accounts.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.280
That's not possible.

42:06.440 --> 42:09.035
You have been
catastrophically compromised.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.760
<i>Forget having your testicles scratched.</i>

42:11.960 --> 42:14.111
<i>You've been castrated.</i>
