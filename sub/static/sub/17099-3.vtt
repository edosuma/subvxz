Well, Higgins,

01:18.020 --> 01:20.897
I do believe we have located our quarry.

It's more accurate to
say that I've located you.

01:24.507 --> 01:27.876
Well, sir, given that we
started four blocks apart...

How does the trackizer work?

01:43.249 --> 01:45.400
Well, it isn't called
a trackizer, Henry,

01:45.421 --> 01:48.374
because here's no such
word as "trackize." Right?

01:48.556 --> 01:50.304
Hmm...

01:50.663 --> 01:52.863
As the wearer walks,

01:53.354 --> 01:55.754
a magnet slides back and forth

01:55.782 --> 01:57.607
inside of a wire coil

01:57.628 --> 01:59.772
inducing an electrical current.

01:59.892 --> 02:02.850
That current is then
converted to voltage.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.204
You know what voltage is, right, Henry?

02:06.240 --> 02:08.610
Yes. It's about... volts.

02:10.143 --> 02:13.108
Right. Now, as the voltage increases

02:13.135 --> 02:15.740
on either side of this gap,

02:15.860 --> 02:18.250
the pressure builds and builds

02:24.231 --> 02:26.417
what happens when our
quarry stops moving?

02:27.503 --> 02:30.305
Well then, the transmission
ends until movement resumes.

02:30.344 --> 02:31.561
Right. So,

02:31.794 --> 02:33.615
what happens if they've arrived,

Hmm.

That... that could be a problem.

Mr. Smith went to
O'Donnell's pub at 8 o'clock.

Returned about 8:30, which
I thought was strange.

(knocking on door) Sir.

07:33.500 --> 07:34.619
Henry, what have you?

07:34.641 --> 07:36.965
We've identified a set of
fingermarks from the doorknob.

07:37.345 --> 07:39.811
- And to whom do they belong?
- Just Miss Pink, sir.

07:39.931 --> 07:41.214
What about Smith's?

07:41.276 --> 07:42.741
We only found one set.

07:45.043 --> 07:48.402
The killer must have wiped down
the fingermarks on his way out.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.327
Then when I returned this morning...

07:51.779 --> 07:52.900
Anything else, Henry?

Turns out we were keeping a
file on a James Smith, sir.

07:55.546 --> 07:57.888
Only one item. It's an incident report

07:57.888 --> 07:59.123
from a couple of months ago.

07:59.154 --> 08:01.323
- Who took that report?
- Well...

08:04.780 --> 08:07.002
Mr. Smith's mother came
in looking for him, sir.

08:07.015 --> 08:08.786
She was wondering if
we'd put him in jail.

08:09.383 --> 08:10.374
In jail?!

08:10.604 --> 08:12.131
It was the only
explanation she would accept

08:12.162 --> 08:14.655
as to why he didn't send
her flowers on her birthday.

08:15.288 --> 08:17.244
And you started a file for him?

08:17.319 --> 08:18.913
Well, sir, I figured if his mother

08:18.922 --> 08:20.980
considered him the jailbird
type, he might well be.

08:21.950 --> 08:23.287
All right. Bring her in.

08:23.340 --> 08:26.346
Sir, that woman's not
the victim's mother.

08:27.102 --> 08:28.293
How do you know that?

08:28.495 --> 08:29.989
Because

08:30.298 --> 08:33.679
the James Robert Smith for whom
this birth certificate was issued

08:33.732 --> 08:36.253
died 30 years ago at
the age of 8 months.

08:36.436 --> 08:38.970
Whoever was living in
that apartment wasn't him.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.431
He must have assumed a
false identity for a reason.

08:41.506 --> 08:43.254
Perhaps that reason caught up with him.

You were looking at him.

11:03.847 --> 11:05.812
I thought he might be a client.

11:07.358 --> 11:10.053
I received a call from
a telephone exchange.

11:10.376 --> 11:13.996
A man asked to meet with me
at O'Donnell's at 8 o'clock.

11:14.576 --> 11:17.723
Are you in the habit of
meeting strangers in taverns?

11:18.161 --> 11:20.436
Meeting with clients in taverns

11:20.463 --> 11:22.402
comprises a good part of my business.

11:22.636 --> 11:24.757
- (bell tolling outside)
- Who was this client?

11:25.230 --> 11:26.408
I don't know.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.484
He never showed up.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.671
♪♪♪

11:30.755 --> 11:33.371
Believe me, if I had known
that man was James Smith,

11:33.411 --> 11:35.642
I would have delivered the
letter right then and there

11:35.651 --> 11:38.169
and saved myself a lot of bother.

11:38.691 --> 11:41.586
Sir we found these
in Miss Pink's office.

11:41.706 --> 11:43.720
She had them filed under James Smith.

11:43.985 --> 11:46.765
I've shown them to several
of Mr. Smith's neighbours;

11:46.787 --> 11:48.491
they all positively identified him.

11:48.885 --> 11:50.745
Sir, she not only knew who he was...

11:50.811 --> 11:52.254
She was following him.

11:53.556 --> 11:55.584
Sir, she could be our killer.

12:06.754 --> 12:08.922
(indistinct conversations)

12:11.204 --> 12:13.590
So it's to be a formal interview.

12:14.562 --> 12:16.073
Am I a suspect?

12:17.699 --> 12:19.667
Did you take these photographs?

12:20.401 --> 12:22.345
No. I did not.

12:24.905 --> 12:26.510
Do you know who that is?

12:26.630 --> 12:27.621
Should I?

12:27.741 --> 12:30.578
Please, answer the question, Miss Pink.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.132
"Miss Pink," is it?

12:34.013 --> 12:35.613
Very well, Detective.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.091
It's James Smith!

12:42.122 --> 12:43.861
So you do know what he looks like.

12:44.729 --> 12:46.562
He's the man I saw at O'Donnell's.

12:46.570 --> 12:48.341
The man you said was Smith.

12:48.461 --> 12:49.766
We've been over this.

12:51.465 --> 12:53.437
You've never seen these
photographs before?

12:53.454 --> 12:54.331
No.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.796
Why?

12:56.341 --> 12:57.487
Because

12:58.116 --> 12:59.670
they were found in your files.

12:59.692 --> 13:01.347
You went into my office?

13:01.803 --> 13:04.437
- You went through my files!?
- I needed to know the truth.

13:04.557 --> 13:06.335
And I've answered you truthfully.

13:06.503 --> 13:08.163
I've done nothing wrong!

13:08.332 --> 13:10.072
You, on the other hand, have breached

13:10.081 --> 13:12.528
the confidentiality
I swore to my clients.

13:14.037 --> 13:16.724
So you don't know how they
ended up in your files.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.751
What's your explanation then?

13:20.261 --> 13:21.062
Well,

13:21.527 --> 13:23.740
clearly everything
I've told you is a lie.

13:24.218 --> 13:27.179
I've been secretly
following James Smith,

13:27.210 --> 13:29.016
or whoever he is,

13:29.078 --> 13:31.283
and after going to considerable effort

13:31.296 --> 13:33.850
to leave a trail of
evidence pointing to me,

13:33.970 --> 13:36.541
I killed him and kidnapped his son.

13:37.042 --> 13:39.843
Or who knows, maybe
I killed the son, too.

13:40.233 --> 13:42.215
I have no motive for any of this,

13:42.233 --> 13:44.836
but then maybe I do this
sort of thing for sport.

13:46.355 --> 13:47.554
Or maybe,

13:48.191 --> 13:50.954
possibly, there is the tiniest chance

13:51.480 --> 13:52.975
that the killer took these photos

13:52.991 --> 13:54.883
and left them in my office.

13:54.905 --> 13:57.854
- And the killer being?
- The man who hired me to find Smith.

13:57.902 --> 14:00.058
- Kenneth Spokes?
- We know he arranged for me

14:00.067 --> 14:01.599
to be at the scene of the crime.

14:02.625 --> 14:05.680
So it's your assertion then that Spokes

14:05.853 --> 14:08.580
waited for you to find Mr. Smith,

14:08.633 --> 14:11.431
then took photographs
of him and his son,

14:11.489 --> 14:13.254
then planted those photographs

14:13.374 --> 14:16.216
in your files to make
it appear as though

14:16.234 --> 14:18.841
you had been following James Smith?

14:19.183 --> 14:20.771
Is that so hard to believe?

14:21.316 --> 14:23.334
And you were in that
apartment the first time... ?

14:23.352 --> 14:25.552
Two days ago. Thursday afternoon.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.364
The earliest that these photographs

14:29.395 --> 14:31.016
could have been taken was

14:31.136 --> 14:32.498
Thursday afternoon?

14:32.667 --> 14:35.438
If you need to walk through
every step, then yes.

14:40.590 --> 14:42.494
There are tulips in this photo.

14:43.264 --> 14:46.166
Tulip season has been over for weeks.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.994
A witness saw you go into the apartment

14:49.001 --> 14:50.832
yet no one saw you come out.

14:51.243 --> 14:52.645
So you're suggesting what?

14:53.502 --> 14:55.019
I waited inside?

14:55.100 --> 14:56.654
Killed him when he returned?

14:56.693 --> 14:57.929
Disposed of the body?

14:58.666 --> 15:00.117
Where did you spend the night?

15:00.967 --> 15:02.967
I don't have an alibi, Detective.

15:03.643 --> 15:05.301
If I had realized that I would need one,

15:05.315 --> 15:06.774
I would have arranged it.

15:13.519 --> 15:14.553
Excuse me.

15:17.647 --> 15:20.741
(door opening and closing)

15:20.780 --> 15:22.706
(sigh)

15:23.488 --> 15:24.855
Freddie Pink?!

15:24.879 --> 15:27.192
She was at the scene and has no alibi.

15:27.209 --> 15:29.454
William, we're talking about Freddie!

15:29.497 --> 15:33.067
She is at the center of this
and has not been forthcoming.

15:33.086 --> 15:36.188
She's a private investigator;
they're rarely forthcoming.

15:36.358 --> 15:38.489
Sir, the Bank of Montreal in King Street

15:38.527 --> 15:40.409
has an account for a James Robert Smith.

15:40.416 --> 15:41.991
I was gonna go by and get the details.

15:42.034 --> 15:44.031
- Very good. Thank you, George.
- Sir.

15:45.266 --> 15:47.792
♪♪♪

15:48.005 --> 15:50.012
So before we continue,

15:50.210 --> 15:53.160
am I correct in assuming
I am the primary suspect

15:53.174 --> 15:54.857
in the murder of James Smith?

15:56.234 --> 15:56.956
Yes.

15:57.385 --> 15:59.407
Bearing in mind that we
don't know it's a murder

15:59.418 --> 16:00.820
seeing as there's no body.

16:01.411 --> 16:03.457
But let's not quibble over trifles.

16:03.577 --> 16:05.419
Convince me otherwise.

16:06.552 --> 16:07.505
Alright.

16:08.372 --> 16:10.401
Assuming I killed this man,

16:10.918 --> 16:12.388
why would I call you?

16:13.414 --> 16:14.788
There were witnesses.

16:15.128 --> 16:17.370
You may have left evidence inside.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.572
Far safer for you to insert yourself

16:19.579 --> 16:21.240
directly into the investigation,

16:21.247 --> 16:22.706
possibly control it.

16:22.943 --> 16:25.719
If it were my intention
to deflect suspicion,

16:25.904 --> 16:28.123
why would I point out that
the killer was likely a woman?

16:28.279 --> 16:30.124
You would have anticipated
that I would come

16:30.142 --> 16:31.444
to the same conclusion.

16:31.564 --> 16:33.511
In fact, that's precisely the logic

16:33.522 --> 16:35.731
a smart woman such as
yourself would employ.

16:35.742 --> 16:36.903
If I'm so smart,

16:36.956 --> 16:39.833
do you not think me capable
of anticipating your response?

16:40.157 --> 16:42.637
Why would I embark on
such a doomed strategy

16:42.642 --> 16:44.882
unless I were, in fact, innocent?

16:45.361 --> 16:47.273
Or are you suggesting

16:47.287 --> 16:49.375
that I anticipated your response

16:49.396 --> 16:52.321
to my response to your response?

16:52.782 --> 16:54.857
- In which case...
- I understand.

16:54.977 --> 16:56.840
We're in a recursive loop.

16:56.876 --> 16:58.685
Infinite regress, actually.

16:59.907 --> 17:01.119
Why not just

17:01.183 --> 17:04.248
stab him in a dark alley and
throw the knife in the lake?

17:04.580 --> 17:06.359
And why would I take his son?

17:06.363 --> 17:07.882
I don't even like children.

17:08.584 --> 17:09.703
Come on, Detective.

17:10.354 --> 17:11.512
There must be some way

17:11.516 --> 17:13.551
I can convince you that
I'm telling the truth.

17:18.566 --> 17:20.942
So this is the famous truthizer?

17:21.778 --> 17:24.263
Constable Crabtree calls it a truthizer.

17:24.462 --> 17:27.019
I prefer autonomic response indicator.

17:28.159 --> 17:29.257
How does it work?

17:29.756 --> 17:33.222
When a person lies, the body
responds as if to stress...

17:33.371 --> 17:36.430
an increase in heart
rate, sweating, etcetera...

17:36.454 --> 17:39.567
responses that are controlled
only by the subconscious mind.

17:40.116 --> 17:41.536
How accurate is it?

17:41.897 --> 17:44.638
It can't prove your guilt
if that's what you're asking.

17:44.978 --> 17:47.166
- (pumping sounds)
- Can it prove innocence?

17:47.807 --> 17:49.053
(pumping sounds)

17:49.074 --> 17:49.853
Possibly.

17:53.186 --> 17:54.559
Alrighty then.

17:55.052 --> 17:56.231
"Truthize" me.

17:59.447 --> 18:03.054
(machine revving up)
(audible regular pulse)

18:03.330 --> 18:05.682
Who is James Robert Smith?

18:06.003 --> 18:07.129
I don't know.

18:11.613 --> 18:13.769
Did you take these photographs?

18:13.889 --> 18:14.895
I did not.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.861
Had you ever seen this
man prior to yesterday?

18:21.031 --> 18:21.977
No.

18:26.269 --> 18:27.824
(tapping wood)

18:28.263 --> 18:30.040
Maybe your machine's not working.

18:30.925 --> 18:33.376
It's possible it isn't
calibrated correctly.

18:33.418 --> 18:35.405
Umm, tell me a deliberate lie.

18:35.883 --> 18:38.231
I killed James Smith
and kidnapped his son.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.090
Hmm!

18:40.436 --> 18:42.105
Looks like that's a lie.

18:44.955 --> 18:46.548
So you will release her?

18:46.768 --> 18:48.888
She answered the questions truthfully.

18:49.242 --> 18:51.035
- George, what have you?
- Sir,

18:51.049 --> 18:52.944
the bank account for James Robert Smith

18:52.962 --> 18:55.246
was opened on May 18 in Montreal.

18:55.684 --> 18:56.634
Montreal...

18:56.716 --> 18:58.525
$1500 was deposited,

18:58.532 --> 19:00.646
- then transferred to Toronto.
- By whom?

19:00.766 --> 19:01.967
Joe Murphy.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.640
I was wondering if that might
be Mr. Smith's real name.

19:04.927 --> 19:06.874
You think Joe Murphy changed his name

19:06.888 --> 19:08.996
to James Smith and moved to Toronto?

19:09.024 --> 19:10.125
It's a thought.

19:11.616 --> 19:12.643
That's a good one, George.

19:12.665 --> 19:14.991
See what you can find
out about this Joe Murphy.

19:14.995 --> 19:16.245
Sir. Doctor.

19:18.030 --> 19:20.356
Freddie Pink is from Montreal.

19:21.543 --> 19:23.475
A lot of people are from Montreal.

19:23.624 --> 19:26.411
Yes, but she only
moved here last summer,

19:26.478 --> 19:29.056
and she alluded to some
kind of trouble there.

19:30.359 --> 19:32.101
Julia, do you think it's possible

19:32.140 --> 19:34.647
for a skilled liar to fool my machine?

19:35.585 --> 19:38.280
Gurus from India are able
to control their heart rates,

19:38.292 --> 19:39.814
so I suppose it's possible.

19:40.294 --> 19:42.561
So surprise would be key.

19:47.335 --> 19:49.159
(pumping sounds)

19:50.228 --> 19:52.356
- (machine revving up)
- Am I not to be released?

19:52.374 --> 19:53.468
(audible regular pulse)

19:53.588 --> 19:54.428
Very shortly.

19:54.835 --> 19:56.468
Just a few more questions.

19:59.021 --> 20:00.140
Ask away.

20:01.714 --> 20:02.817
Who is Joe Murphy?

20:04.658 --> 20:06.301
I haven't even answered.

20:07.551 --> 20:10.376
What happened last May 18th in Montreal?

20:10.496 --> 20:11.665
I don't remember.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.156
Why did you leave Montreal?

20:15.641 --> 20:18.116
I was running from a jealous lover.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.988
That's a lie. Tell the truth.

20:21.247 --> 20:23.188
- Who is Joe Murphy?
- I don't know!

20:23.765 --> 20:25.869
(machine beeping fast)

20:35.611 --> 20:36.581
Miss Pink?

20:36.659 --> 20:38.380
I don't want to play anymore.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.115
I've answered enough questions.

20:40.154 --> 20:41.528
No, I don't believe you have.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.994
I have a right to silence.

20:44.134 --> 20:45.685
Please instruct a constable

20:45.699 --> 20:47.212
to escort me to my cell.

20:48.801 --> 20:49.793
Very well.

20:55.153 --> 20:56.003
Detective.

20:56.938 --> 20:58.450
I just spoke to police in Montreal.

20:58.471 --> 21:00.210
Joe Murphy is well known to them, sir.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.725
In fact, the entire Murphy clan.

21:01.739 --> 21:04.569
Their mother is the notorious Ma Murphy.

21:05.494 --> 21:06.524
I have never heard of her.

21:06.538 --> 21:08.001
Thank God, Sir. Neither did I,

21:08.032 --> 21:09.352
I didn't let them know that.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.909
Why did Joe Murphy leave Montreal?

21:12.029 --> 21:14.395
Well sir, he's suspected
of killing his wife, Molly.

21:14.438 --> 21:17.045
Apparently, Molly found out
about Joe's criminal activity

21:17.257 --> 21:18.475
and threatened to notify the police

21:18.493 --> 21:19.962
unless he granted her a divorce.

21:20.486 --> 21:22.048
How did the police know this?

21:22.776 --> 21:25.336
Well, Molly's best friend,
sir, notified the police.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.317
But of course by that time,

21:26.338 --> 21:28.534
Joe was in Toronto living
under an assumed name.

21:29.058 --> 21:30.921
And the name of her best friend?

21:31.717 --> 21:33.176
Freddie Pink, sir.

21:33.194 --> 21:34.660
(small sigh)

21:35.524 --> 21:38.232
According to police,
she harassed the Murphys.

21:38.352 --> 21:40.114
So much so that at one point,

21:40.117 --> 21:42.717
she tells the police they
threatened to have her killed.

21:42.922 --> 21:44.837
I suspect that's why she left Montreal.

21:46.194 --> 21:48.506
In any case, the Montreal police
are sending the files over.

21:48.527 --> 21:50.170

I'm sorry, sir. I know how this looks.

21:56.637 --> 21:59.102
So, she came to Toronto,

21:59.854 --> 22:03.446

learned of his new identity and

exacted her revenge.

But what of the young boy.
What did she do with him?

22:09.508 --> 22:10.825
Sir, I think the question is

22:10.847 --> 22:12.436
what does she intend to do with him.

22:12.826 --> 22:13.598
Um,

22:13.771 --> 22:15.078
Jackson found...

22:15.733 --> 22:16.633
this.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.548
It's a letter from

And the blood on the floor?

27:35.556 --> 27:36.732
Animal blood?

27:37.989 --> 27:40.083
Easy to obtain. Fully convincing.

27:47.704 --> 27:49.708
I didn't kill him, William.

So either someone else did,

At this point?

28:07.131 --> 28:08.869
I don't know what to believe.

28:09.634 --> 28:11.813
It's as credible as the theory that

28:11.834 --> 28:13.445
Freddie Pink is the killer.

28:14.259 --> 28:17.284
Although both theories
raise many questions.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.605
Such as?

28:20.227 --> 28:22.146
If Freddie is not the killer,

28:22.922 --> 28:24.746
then why did she not think

28:24.778 --> 28:26.871
of this theory before now?

28:27.391 --> 28:29.452
And if she did think of it before now,

28:29.470 --> 28:31.669
why not bring it to me earlier?

28:32.249 --> 28:33.652
And if she is the killer?

28:33.772 --> 28:35.543
Then why provide us with the means of

28:35.572 --> 28:38.312
positively determining
her theory to be false?

28:39.406 --> 28:41.995
I'm afraid I have bad news
in that regard, William.

28:42.991 --> 28:45.366
The blood cells are
partially decomposed.

28:45.416 --> 28:47.526
I can't tell if they had nuclei or not.

28:47.572 --> 28:49.555
And did she deliberately wait

28:49.615 --> 28:51.432
until it would be impossible for us

28:51.450 --> 28:54.226
to determine whether it
was human or animal blood?

28:54.240 --> 28:56.766
That would explain why she
didn't tell you about it before.

28:57.116 --> 29:00.041
Perhaps this is all
part of a fallback plan.

29:01.628 --> 29:03.692
Initially deny knowing the victim,

29:03.739 --> 29:04.939
then if found out,

29:05.013 --> 29:06.390
deny that there was a victim?

29:06.574 --> 29:08.284
It would be nearly impossible for us

29:08.295 --> 29:09.917
to obtain a conviction without a body.

29:09.927 --> 29:13.503
Especially if we were unable
to disprove this theory.

29:13.723 --> 29:16.230
But, William, what of
Joe and Molly's son?

29:16.244 --> 29:18.553
Where is he? Who's taking care of him?

29:19.748 --> 29:20.816
Perhaps no one.

29:21.747 --> 29:23.915
Freddie Pink would never
leave a child on his own.

29:24.071 --> 29:26.588
She might if the
alternative was to be hanged!

29:29.769 --> 29:30.675
What?

29:31.667 --> 29:33.175
If she does know where he is,

29:33.193 --> 29:35.909
that would be the first place
she would go if she was let out.

29:38.401 --> 29:39.247
Well,

29:39.739 --> 29:41.357
did you prove it was animal blood?

29:41.702 --> 29:43.340

32:43.581 --> 32:44.501
Ma'am.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.533
Excuse me. Miss Pink!

32:47.976 --> 32:50.297
Please, we're late for our train.

32:51.855 --> 32:54.099
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Detective.

32:54.922 --> 32:57.879
- What have you, Henry?
- Miss Pink did stop at the telegraph office, sir.

32:57.923 --> 32:59.566
- She sent the telegram.
- What did it say?

32:59.579 --> 33:01.527
Just one word. "Go."

33:02.253 --> 33:04.174
- Who was it sent to?
- That's the thing, sir.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.139
Joe Murphy.

33:05.608 --> 33:06.608
"Joe Murphy"?

33:07.157 --> 33:08.179
What was the address?

33:08.263 --> 33:10.158
General delivery at the
Temperance Exchange, sir.

33:10.185 --> 33:11.322
Right. Henry, head down there

33:11.344 --> 33:12.916
and see if anyone
collects that telegram.

33:12.951 --> 33:14.535
- Sir.
- Joe Murphy, sir.

33:14.709 --> 33:15.944
I don't understand.

33:16.462 --> 33:17.843
I don't either, George.

33:19.852 --> 33:20.870
George,

33:21.512 --> 33:23.088
that man walking toward us,

33:23.610 --> 33:25.292
I... I've seen him recently.

33:25.412 --> 33:27.350
(George): Sir, I recognize his hat.

33:28.566 --> 33:30.576
I found these in Miss Pink's office.

33:30.643 --> 33:31.913
That's Joe Murphy.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.733
Mr. Murphy!

33:35.392 --> 33:36.872
Toronto Constabulary.

33:36.907 --> 33:38.088
We'd like a word.

33:46.207 --> 33:48.314
I believe these photographs are of you?

33:48.434 --> 33:49.637
Believe what you like.

33:49.845 --> 33:51.579
You came to Toronto one year ago

33:51.610 --> 33:53.912
with your son after
murdering his mother.

33:54.338 --> 33:57.618
You assumed the identity
of one James Smith.

33:57.897 --> 34:01.508
No fewer than five witnesses
have identified this man,

34:01.916 --> 34:03.846
you, as James Smith.

34:04.581 --> 34:06.714
You then became aware
that you were being pursued

34:06.723 --> 34:09.033
by a woman who knew
of your true identity

34:09.379 --> 34:11.128
as Joe Murphy.

34:11.668 --> 34:14.147
You then made it appear as
though you had been murdered

34:14.190 --> 34:15.956
and set her up as the killer.

34:16.306 --> 34:18.002
You can't prove this is me.

34:18.844 --> 34:20.088
Actually, I can.

34:20.579 --> 34:22.661
You can grow a beard,

34:22.929 --> 34:25.222
but your identifying
features remain the same.

34:25.478 --> 34:27.409
And in combination,
they allow for each face

34:27.409 --> 34:30.436
to be identified with
mathematical precision.

34:31.331 --> 34:32.693
Please don't smile.

34:34.126 --> 34:35.371
(Click!)

34:35.885 --> 34:37.690
What do you mean, "it's not him"?!

34:37.697 --> 34:39.741
The numbers don't lie, Julia.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.512
The ratio of the
distance between his eyes

34:42.534 --> 34:45.071
and the distance
between his chin and nose

34:45.110 --> 34:47.371
is 1.27 in the mugshot.

34:47.406 --> 34:49.985
Here, it's 1.41.

34:50.710 --> 34:52.004
Ear to eye

34:52.034 --> 34:54.004
versus chin to midpoint:

34:54.074 --> 34:55.623
1.87

34:55.871 --> 34:57.739
versus 1.69.

34:57.859 --> 34:59.133
They're close, William.

34:59.164 --> 35:00.789
Perhaps within the margins of error?

35:00.820 --> 35:02.298
I measured very carefully.

35:02.338 --> 35:05.021
So who is he? He's clearly
involved in all of this.

35:05.052 --> 35:06.065
(sigh)

35:06.083 --> 35:07.969
Joe Murphy did have a brother, sir.

35:08.611 --> 35:09.788
What was his name?

35:09.908 --> 35:12.094
Adam. He wasn't in the police files,

35:12.643 --> 35:14.731
but they both had a
son about the same age.

35:15.175 --> 35:17.747
So, if Adam was living with his own son

35:17.787 --> 35:19.828
under Joe's pseudonym, where's Joe?

35:20.346 --> 35:22.967
And why would Freddie
Pink send him a telegram?

35:23.174 --> 35:24.995
- Sir.
- Henry,

35:25.030 --> 35:27.091
- what have you?
- I went to Temperance Exchange.

35:27.111 --> 35:28.996
Did anyone claim Joe Murphy's message?

35:29.023 --> 35:32.099
No, sir. But the telegraph operator
who took the message has disappeared.

35:32.267 --> 35:34.215
Her name was Doris Walmer, sir.

35:34.441 --> 35:36.800
The woman named in the visa application.

35:36.858 --> 35:38.243
Did you get a description?

35:38.363 --> 35:40.532
Red hair. Green eyes. Pretty.

- She could still be on that train, sir.

35:50.624 --> 35:52.590
She's likely well
over the border by now.

35:53.537 --> 35:56.229
Miss Pink used the telegram
to let her client know to flee.

35:56.561 --> 35:58.584
Yes, but why address it to Joe Murphy?

35:59.008 --> 36:00.593
Perhaps that was the signal.

36:00.722 --> 36:02.705
If a telegram was
addressed to Joe Murphy,

36:02.714 --> 36:04.051
it's actually meant for her.

36:04.856 --> 36:06.948
But then what's the connection

36:06.983 --> 36:09.217
between Doris Walmer and Joe Murphy?

36:11.580 --> 36:12.838
What is it, William?

36:13.931 --> 36:16.366
Could Doris Walmer be Molly Murphy?

36:16.383 --> 36:18.632
Sir, Molly Murphy was murdered.

36:19.095 --> 36:20.690
Was a body ever found?

36:21.203 --> 36:22.979
- No...
- At any rate,

36:23.013 --> 36:25.028
we know a murder was
committed in Montreal

36:25.059 --> 36:27.108
on the 18th of May last year.

36:27.781 --> 36:30.145
What if Molly Murphy wasn't the victim?

36:30.450 --> 36:31.761
It was Joe!

36:31.881 --> 36:34.296
But Joe changed his identity.

36:34.305 --> 36:35.602
He set up the bank account.

36:36.005 --> 36:38.589
I have no doubt Joe Murphy
intended to murder his wife

36:38.607 --> 36:41.502
- and leave town. But somehow...
- She got the upper hand

36:41.516 --> 36:43.038
and killed him instead!

36:43.494 --> 36:45.165
So it could have been self-defence.

36:45.534 --> 36:47.185
She would have called her best friend

36:47.203 --> 36:48.774
who would have known exactly what to do.

36:48.805 --> 36:51.001
They buried the body, and then Freddie

36:51.067 --> 36:53.210
helped Molly to flee to Toronto

36:53.480 --> 36:54.622
with her son.

36:54.728 --> 36:56.339
That's why she was so insistent

36:56.344 --> 36:58.176
that it was Joe that killed Molly.

36:58.432 --> 37:00.924
She couldn't let anyone find
out that Molly was still alive,

37:00.933 --> 37:02.935
living in Toronto as Doris Walmer.

37:02.939 --> 37:04.630
The Murphys discovered what happened.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.728
They set up Pink for the
murder of James Smith.

37:08.498 --> 37:09.548
But why?

37:10.304 --> 37:11.286
(George): Revenge?

37:13.345 --> 37:14.746
(Murdoch snapping fingers) Leverage.

37:14.781 --> 37:16.200
If she was charged with murder,

37:16.226 --> 37:18.223
she'd have no choice
but to tell the truth

37:18.245 --> 37:19.560
about what happened in Montreal

37:19.569 --> 37:21.200
and give up Molly and the child.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.541
"Tell us where the child is
and you will be forgiven."

37:24.917 --> 37:27.617
She would have understood the
message. But she didn't give them up.

37:27.827 --> 37:29.706
So what have they done with Freddie?

37:31.645 --> 37:33.792
I was mistaken, Mr. Murphy.

37:34.248 --> 37:37.450
You are not Joe. In fact,

37:37.570 --> 37:41.024
- you are Joe's brother, Adam.
- Am I free to go?

37:42.975 --> 37:46.181
You set up Freddie
Pink for a murder that

37:46.265 --> 37:48.461
- never happened.
- Never happened?

37:48.881 --> 37:50.829
My brother was murdered, Detective,

37:50.851 --> 37:52.701
and Freddie Pink is
up to her neck in it.

37:54.051 --> 37:56.255
- Where is she?
- To whom do you refer?

37:56.375 --> 37:58.703
The one who killed my
brother or her best friend?

37:59.699 --> 38:01.591
Tell me where Miss Pink is

38:01.626 --> 38:03.418
or you will be going to jail.

38:04.029 --> 38:05.450
On what charge?

38:05.520 --> 38:08.012
Spilling chicken blood on
the floor of my apartment?

38:08.132 --> 38:09.089
Kidnapping.

38:09.129 --> 38:11.090
You have no proof of
that. (Adam chuckling)

And... and you go by Pink.

40:40.634 --> 40:41.790
Get away from her!

40:41.807 --> 40:44.450

Sure that's no crime.

foot for 40 minutes!

41:02.895 --> 41:03.873
How did you know?

41:04.103 --> 41:06.290
You released me in order to follow me.

41:06.649 --> 41:07.818
But you didn't.

41:08.871 --> 41:11.191
Then I remembered the
ridiculous shoe mark

41:11.195 --> 41:13.143
you invented to get my shoe from me.

41:30.697 --> 41:33.260
But when she found out he
and his family were criminals,

41:33.273 --> 41:34.636
she wanted out.

41:34.844 --> 41:37.155
More importantly, she
wanted her son out.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.847
- But Joe wouldn't have that.
- He tried to kill her.

41:40.453 --> 41:41.741
Molly fought back.

41:41.763 --> 41:42.688
She grabbed a knife...

41:42.728 --> 41:44.626
it must have hit the carotid artery

41:44.640 --> 41:46.442
because there was blood everywhere.

41:47.099 --> 41:48.863
From that moment, she was a dead woman

41:48.863 --> 41:50.691
unless I helped her. So I did.

41:50.811 --> 41:52.665
So the body was disposed of

41:52.842 --> 41:54.652
but you made it appear as though

41:54.661 --> 41:56.539
he killed his wife and then ran away.

41:56.659 --> 41:58.764
A rather elegant solution, I thought.

41:58.826 --> 42:01.694
Until Ma Murphy didn't get
her flowers for her birthday.

42:01.713 --> 42:03.539
She then realized that her son was dead,

42:03.659 --> 42:06.062
and that the blood that was
found in the Montreal apartment

42:06.084 --> 42:09.360
by the police was in fact
his and not his wife's.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.990
And she wanted Molly dead
and her grandson back.

42:12.711 --> 42:14.624
That's why they set me up for murder.

42:14.659 --> 42:17.770
They thought I'd give them up
rather than be facing the noose.

42:17.890 --> 42:19.678
But why bother setting you up at all?

42:19.696 --> 42:22.174
Why not simply torture
you for the information?

42:22.900 --> 42:25.361
I think they enjoyed
the irony of having me

42:25.387 --> 42:27.169
implicated in Joe's murder.

42:27.428 --> 42:29.407
But you still are implicated.

42:29.641 --> 42:30.880
How so?

42:31.225 --> 42:33.342
Joe was killed by Molly in self-defence.

42:33.673 --> 42:35.700
You lied to me.

42:36.146 --> 42:38.231
Until you mentioned Joe Murphy's name,

42:38.248 --> 42:40.381
everything I told you
was the absolute truth.

42:41.145 --> 42:42.684
I only lied to save my friend.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.686
And lying is not a crime.

42:44.721 --> 42:46.236
You buried a body.

42:47.001 --> 42:48.064
Prove it.

42:49.724 --> 42:51.185
I just might.

42:51.999 --> 42:53.916
But until then, you're free to go.

42:54.217 --> 42:55.364
Thank you.

42:55.855 --> 42:57.303
