00:01.034 --> 00:02.936
REBECCA: Previously
on The Practice:

00:02.969 --> 00:05.038
I have a good portion
of the money.

00:05.071 --> 00:06.406
You're two weeks late now.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.242
I'm gonna borrow some money
from my retirement account.

00:09.275 --> 00:10.511
My proposal is this--

00:10.544 --> 00:12.312
you provide
some legal services,

00:12.345 --> 00:13.980
and your debt goes away.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.849
The guy's my bookie.
What do you owe?

00:15.882 --> 00:17.350
Twenty-seven thousand.

00:17.383 --> 00:19.920
His ex-wife is suing him
for fraud.

00:19.953 --> 00:20.821
He won the lottery,

00:20.854 --> 00:23.356
she's claiming he didn't
tell her.

00:23.389 --> 00:27.127
I get 70,
and you get 30.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.629
(camera shutter clicking)

00:28.895 --> 00:30.731
You believe this?
They think I whacked her.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.800
Did you?
Check my alibi,
you want peace of mind.

00:33.834 --> 00:34.968
Did you have it done?

00:35.001 --> 00:36.770
All right, just get me out.

00:36.803 --> 00:39.506
Your wife's estate
can still make a claim.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.841
Do you want me
to follow up on that?

00:40.874 --> 00:45.111
No. Think I might engage
new counsel, just the same.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.380
So I guess we're done, then.

00:47.413 --> 00:49.716
You still owe me
the 27, Jimmy.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.417
Didn't exactly
work that off.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.720
What do you say you walk
out the door,

00:53.754 --> 00:56.790
forget my debt,
and I'll forget

00:56.823 --> 00:58.992
how you threatened
to kill your wife?

00:59.025 --> 01:01.461
The truth is
I got more on you

01:01.494 --> 01:02.796
than you got on me.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.498
I'm asking you...

01:05.532 --> 01:08.034
to get out of this office, now.

01:09.369 --> 01:12.005
I need that money.
I'll give you a week.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.514
I can't even believe
they're letting him out.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.182
He's managed to convince
the shrinks

01:22.215 --> 01:23.684
he's no longer a danger.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.554
Remember, he was never
actually charged

01:27.588 --> 01:29.756
in the kidnapping
of your son.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.626
The police know he did it.
They just couldn't prove it.

01:32.659 --> 01:35.061
Plus he's a convicted
child molester.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.030
Don't these people
repeat their crimes?

01:38.131 --> 01:40.767
What exactly are you
hiring me to do?

01:40.801 --> 01:42.068
To try to keep him in jail?

01:43.804 --> 01:44.671
We want to bury our son.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.807
Only he knows
where the body is.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.610
If there even
still is one.

01:51.344 --> 01:55.582
We were wondering
if we could somehow

01:55.616 --> 01:58.184
force him to tell us
where the remains are.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.452
I really don't see how.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.088
If he were to tell us
where the body is,

02:02.122 --> 02:04.357
he'd effectively be
admitting to the murder.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.992
We're told you have
a relationship

02:06.026 --> 02:07.961
with the DA's office.

02:07.994 --> 02:09.562
Could you--
We were thinking

02:09.596 --> 02:12.866
if you could get them
to consider filing charges

02:12.899 --> 02:14.200
against Pierce
for the kidnapping,

02:14.234 --> 02:17.437
that would give you
some leverage, wouldn't it?

02:17.470 --> 02:18.739
Maybe we could
make some deal.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.107
I know you've been
to the DA's office,

02:21.141 --> 02:22.876
and I know what
they've told you.

02:22.909 --> 02:25.311
Because we're just two
anonymous people,

02:25.345 --> 02:27.681
walking in off the street.
They know you.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.349
If you asked--
Mr. Baldwin,

02:29.382 --> 02:32.218
first of all,
this kidnapping happened

02:32.252 --> 02:35.188
eighteen years ago.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.524
If they couldn't
build a case then,
there's no way.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.265
I think you have to
let it go now.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.168
We can't let it go.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.838
We need to bury our son.

03:02.315 --> 03:05.318
(music playing)

03:53.834 --> 03:55.201
Wrongful death?

03:55.235 --> 03:58.071
For a murder that took place
18 years ago?

03:58.104 --> 04:00.173
It's a long shot.
ELLENOR: What's the end game?

04:00.707 --> 04:03.043
Even if you do win,
does he have any assets?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.277
It's not about money.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.411
Then what's it about?

04:05.445 --> 04:07.848
The parents want
to bury their son.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.949
They want closure.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.951
If I can create the threat
of a lawsuit,

04:10.984 --> 04:12.352
maybe we can get this guy
to reveal

04:12.385 --> 04:13.520
where the remains are.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.923
Forgive me. I don't mean
to be insensitive,

04:16.957 --> 04:20.493
but suppose you do succeed--
what's our contingency?

04:20.527 --> 04:22.128
Lindsay, try to get
the police records.

04:22.162 --> 04:25.331
Find out whatever
the DA's office has, or had.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.834
Ellenor, research the statute
of limitations issue.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.703
That'll definitely
be challenged.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.772
Rebecca, you and Jimmy
get started on the complaint.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.674
Where is Jimmy?

04:37.143 --> 04:38.278
Thanks.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.918
Jimmy, jeez.
How long's it been?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.052
Aunt Maria's funeral.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.922
Oh, too long.
You put on weight.

04:48.955 --> 04:53.560
Yeah, and you're like this
big fat cat yourself now.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.563
Parking lot king.
Yeah, king.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.666
I barely got
a one and a quarter percent
profit margin going here.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.904
What's up, Jim?

05:05.471 --> 05:07.007
Uh, well...

05:08.174 --> 05:09.643
We're family.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.645
Uh, I've gotten myself

05:11.678 --> 05:14.781
into a little bit
of a financial jam.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.449
Normal circumstances,

05:16.482 --> 05:18.118
I would never hit you up
for a loan.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.054
Normal circumstances,
I'd give it to you.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.189
Problem is, Jimmy,

05:23.223 --> 05:25.959
I just had to write
a sizeable check myself,

05:25.992 --> 05:27.561
so it's gonna depend
on how big

05:27.594 --> 05:29.963
your little bit of a jam is.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.165
I'm feeling sick
to my stomach just asking.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.334
You owe your book.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.840
I keep tabs.
You're family.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.208
Plus, I like the ponies myself.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.409
How much?

05:43.443 --> 05:45.912
It's more football than--
How much?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.049
Twenty-seven grand.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.252
Jimmy.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.723
I wish I could help you,
but, uh,

05:56.757 --> 05:58.491
the timing's just not good.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.667
Hey, listen...

06:07.568 --> 06:10.837
Listen, I got a tip on a horse

06:10.871 --> 06:12.472
running at Suffolk
day after tomorrow.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.339
He's a sure winner.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.176
I've bet on too many
sure winners, Dom.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.644
How I got in this mess.

06:18.979 --> 06:22.616
Well, like I said,
I wish I could help.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.923
I'm going to serve him
with the complaint myself.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.825
Now, listen,
you'll have to sign

06:31.858 --> 06:34.327
a confidentiality agreement.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.696
Why?
Because there's no way

06:35.729 --> 06:37.063
he's gonna tell us
where the body is

06:37.097 --> 06:39.633
if he thinks you'll go
running to the police.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.702
This isn't about that.
I understand.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.470
But he'll obviously need
to be convinced.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.340
We will give him
whatever he wants.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.209
Just tell us
where Chad is.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.244
You'll agree
not to pursue him

06:51.277 --> 06:52.946
civilly or criminally.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.314
We understand.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.917
May I go with you?
To the prison?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.720
I don't think
that's a great idea.

06:59.753 --> 07:03.557
A mother's plea might--
This is not about a plea,
Mrs. Baldwin.

07:04.290 --> 07:06.727
This is a threat.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.261
Better it come
from a lawyer.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.099
Are you serious?

07:13.133 --> 07:14.901
I'm just asking you
to check it out.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.638
Lindsay, a kidnapping
that happened 18 years ago,

07:17.671 --> 07:19.540
I can promise you
it's inactive.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.374
I'd just like you to review
the file if you could...

07:21.407 --> 07:22.976
Assuming I can
even find it.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.678
...and tell me
what you have.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.980
Please.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.018
I just want to make sure

07:32.052 --> 07:33.887
you've truly considered
the ramifications

07:33.920 --> 07:37.423
of closing out
your IRA.
I have.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.025
Realizing that you'll
be liable

07:39.059 --> 07:40.927
for taxes
on the entire amount.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.228
Realizing that.

07:43.930 --> 07:47.100
Also realizing you'll pay
a fairly onerous penalty

07:47.133 --> 07:48.502
for early withdrawal.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.370
Also realizing.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.138
Do you own a house?
Because we offer
a wide variety

07:52.172 --> 07:54.074
of home equity products--
Look.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.642
Maybe I ought to be committed.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.410
But this is what I want to do.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.880
If you insist. It's just--

07:59.913 --> 08:01.314
I'm a renter.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.618
How much will I get
from the IRA?

08:06.853 --> 08:08.421
(sighs)

08:13.059 --> 08:14.661
Approximately $8,200.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.998
Eighty-two hundred?

08:18.031 --> 08:20.233
My retirement fund
is $8,200?

08:20.266 --> 08:22.468
You're 23 years shy
of retirement age.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.437
With your maximum
annual contribution,

08:24.470 --> 08:25.906
if you left this
current amount intact--

08:25.939 --> 08:27.373
just give me the money.

08:33.947 --> 08:38.885
Look, I had nothing to do with
that Baldwin kid going missing.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.121
It wasn't me.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.289
You'll need a lawyer.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.991
If the trial starts
before you're released,

08:45.025 --> 08:47.794
you'll be transported
to and from court.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.763
They never even arrested me.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.932
You know why?
Because I didn't do it.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.234
Like you never molested
those three little boys

08:54.267 --> 08:55.669
who put you in here?

08:59.740 --> 09:00.841
You married?

09:02.976 --> 09:05.378
Is that a threat,
Mr. Pierce?

09:05.411 --> 09:07.347
No, it's not a threat.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.517
Look, she gotta be here
for this?
Yes, she does.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.252
I need a witness.

09:12.553 --> 09:16.523
I asked if you're married.
I see the ring on your finger.

09:16.557 --> 09:19.492
You probably got
a nice wife.

09:19.526 --> 09:24.798
You feel like getting it off,
she's who you probably think of.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.701
You got fantasies
about other women,
that's cool.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.103
Everybody understands,
am I right?

09:30.136 --> 09:32.405
What are you
talking about?

09:32.438 --> 09:34.340
I'm explaining something.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.946
Nobody on the planet can help
who they're attracted to.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.147
For me...

09:42.949 --> 09:44.951
...it was always little boys.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.021
I fooled myself
into thinking

09:48.054 --> 09:51.157
it was okay,
it didn't hurt anybody,
not really.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.296
I did some bad things.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.633
I admit it.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.836
And I got to live with that.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.072
So do all the boys
you hurt.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.710
Yeah, and I gotta
live with that, too.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.382
But I had nothing to do
with your clients' kid,

10:16.416 --> 10:18.451
and they got no right
to sue me.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.123
I could probably get them
to drop the suit.

10:23.156 --> 10:26.827
They just want to know
where their son is.

10:26.860 --> 10:31.231
I don't know what happened
to that kid.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.707
Have your attorney call me.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.254
He denied it?
Yes.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.489
Did he deny molesting
those other boys?

10:56.523 --> 10:57.558
No.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.961
But he said he didn't
kidnap your son.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.798
So what happens now?

11:04.831 --> 11:08.234
He retained a lawyer.
A good one.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.337
She filed an immediate motion
for summary judgment.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.139
We go and argue that next.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.908
If we can get by that,

11:14.941 --> 11:18.244
we can at least have
some leverage to make him talk.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.618
BOBBY: So I'll meet you
at the courthouse at 10:00.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.219
Okay.
Thank you.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.855
Good night.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.859
Hey, Jimmy.

11:34.595 --> 11:35.696
Hi.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.600
Everything squared away
with your bookie?

11:39.800 --> 11:40.667
The last I heard,

11:40.701 --> 11:42.569
cops haven't
arrested him yet.

11:42.603 --> 11:45.506
I'm not really following it
since he fired me and all.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.473
I'm talking about
the money you owe him.

11:47.508 --> 11:50.711
Oh, that. Yeah.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.979
We're in the past tense
on that.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.447
Definitely.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.050
Good.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.870
Death would be presumed
after seven years, Your Honor.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.639
Which means the statute
of limitations

12:18.672 --> 12:20.841
for wrongful death
has long since run.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.610
Unless there's fraud
that prevented the Baldwins

12:23.644 --> 12:25.979
from finding out that he
caused the wrongful death.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.313
HENRIETTA: There
wasn't any fraud.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.783
ELLENOR: John Pierce disappeared
days after kidnapping--

12:29.816 --> 12:31.084
HENRIETTA:
Allegedly kidnapping.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.754
He also assumed
a false name and identity--

12:33.787 --> 12:35.055
Alexander Wriat.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.525
That's fraud? Mr. Pierce
wanted a fresh start,

12:38.559 --> 12:39.793
to get out from
under the cloud

12:39.826 --> 12:42.228
of unfounded,
unjust suspicion.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.331
He was convicted of sex crimes
under this alias

12:45.365 --> 12:46.332
in another state.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.268
It took
the Baldwins' investigator

12:48.301 --> 12:51.705
to figure out that Pierce
and Wriat were one and the same.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.040
Why didn't your clients
at least file their lawsuit

12:54.074 --> 12:56.309
within the prescribed period
to preserve their claim?

12:56.342 --> 12:57.477
It would have been pointless

12:57.511 --> 12:59.613
since they couldn't locate
the defendant.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.214
You don't need to know
where a defendant is

13:01.247 --> 13:02.549
in order to file
a lawsuit.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.551
You do in order to serve him.

13:04.585 --> 13:06.352
He was found
three years later.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.221
They could have served him
in prison.

13:08.254 --> 13:11.758
All right. I'm going
to let the claim survive

13:11.792 --> 13:14.260
the statute of limitations
challenge,

13:14.294 --> 13:17.731
but as to whether there's
a case here at all,

13:17.764 --> 13:19.265
there wasn't even
enough evidence

13:19.299 --> 13:20.734
for the police
to make an arrest.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.636
Different standard of proof
in criminal cases.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.538
This is civil.
Oh, who's kidding who?

13:24.571 --> 13:27.007
If the police thought he had
kidnapped Chad Baldwin--

13:27.040 --> 13:28.775
The police did
and do think that.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.611
They're just unable
to prove it.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.112
And you think you can?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.447
I would like at least
to be allowed

13:34.480 --> 13:35.916
to conduct discovery.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.823
I'm going to grant you
a short evidentiary hearing.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.125
If you can make a showing
that you have anything

13:45.158 --> 13:47.928
worth submitting to a jury,
I'll let it stand.

13:47.961 --> 13:51.331
Otherwise, I'm granting
the defendant's motion.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.534
We'll see you back here
tomorrow, 10:00 a. m.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.302
Tomorrow?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.505
If you're not ready
to make a showing, counsel,

13:58.539 --> 14:02.442
after 18 years,
that certainly gives me pause.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.210
We'll be here.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.979
Put the defendant
back into custody.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.962
We just want
to give him a funeral.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.364
I will forgive you
if you just tell us where he is.
Jenny.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.732
Honey.
Mrs. Baldwin!

14:25.766 --> 14:27.701
Jenny, please.
Don't, don't.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.169
Please. Please.
Come on.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.581
I'm sorry.
It's all right.

14:40.614 --> 14:43.116
Okay, it's time to put up
or shut up.

14:43.149 --> 14:46.352
Do we have the transcripts
from the previous trials?
Lucy ordered them.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.288
Okay, Jenny,
you testify first.
Okay.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.890
You might be attacked
on memory,

14:49.923 --> 14:51.792
the fact that it happened
18 years ago.

14:51.825 --> 14:54.494
I've been playing it back
for 18 years, Mr. Donnell.

14:54.528 --> 14:56.329
I remember it
as if it was yesterday.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.231
Good.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.678
Hi, Jimmy.
How you doing?

15:11.712 --> 15:13.847
I asked you
not to come back here.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.616
Let's say I missed you.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.619
Take a
walk with me.

15:18.852 --> 15:19.620
Let's go.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.737
Is this all of it?

15:36.770 --> 15:39.205
I just gave you $14,800.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.474
Which I appreciate,
but you owe me 33.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.609
Twenty-seven.

15:42.643 --> 15:46.446
Thirty-three with
the juice-- 8.25 percent.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.615
This is every penny
I can get my hands on.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.785
Morris.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.887
What a surprise.
You know Jimmy Berluti?

15:56.923 --> 15:58.725
Look, Jimmy, I know
what you're thinking.

15:58.759 --> 15:59.860
Morris is a big guy.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.094
I brought him here
to rough you up

16:01.127 --> 16:03.530
just like in the movies,
right?

16:03.564 --> 16:06.032
Kind of cliche,
if you ask me.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.535
But... I tell you,

16:08.569 --> 16:11.237
whatever words people
might use to describe me...

16:12.338 --> 16:13.674
Uhh!

16:13.707 --> 16:15.441
(choking)

16:17.878 --> 16:20.581
..."original" isn't
one of them.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.553
Thirty-six hours--
I'll have the rest.

16:26.587 --> 16:28.388
You got till tomorrow.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.997
We just caught a break.
What?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.431
That was a guy
named Bud Reynolds.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.100
He's a resident
at state prison.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.968
He claims John Pierce
told him

16:42.002 --> 16:44.370
he kidnapped
the Baldwin boy.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.639
Becca, let's go.

16:49.943 --> 16:55.734
John Pierce confessed to you
he kidnapped, abused,
and killed Chad Baldwin?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.183
Yeah.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.085
After 18 years
of denying it,

16:59.119 --> 17:02.255
he suddenly tells
a stranger he did it?

17:02.288 --> 17:04.525
We weren't strangers.
We were friends.

17:04.558 --> 17:06.627
Which explains why
you're ratting on him.

17:06.660 --> 17:09.194
Hey, you don't got to
believe me.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.564
It's nothing to me.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.965
Why?
Why what?

17:12.999 --> 17:15.868
Why so public-spirited?
What's in it for you?

17:15.902 --> 17:19.105
That warm glow
you get right here

17:19.138 --> 17:21.575
when you squash a maggot.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.877
I said we were friends.
We're not now.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.815
When did this conversation
take place?

17:28.849 --> 17:31.217
Six, eight months ago.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.419
Why didn't you report it?

17:33.453 --> 17:35.055
Tell you the truth,

17:35.088 --> 17:37.724
I kept hoping somebody'd
stick a shank in his throat,

17:37.758 --> 17:40.460
but nobody ever did,
and he's getting out soon.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.498
How exactly did this
conversation come about?

17:46.332 --> 17:47.634
I don't remember.

17:47.668 --> 17:48.835
Just came up.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.974
Jailhouse informants
lie all the time.

17:54.007 --> 17:56.577
But to the police?
To cut a deal here?

17:56.610 --> 17:58.111
What would be his motive?

17:58.144 --> 17:59.846
Well, maybe just
to get a day in court,

17:59.880 --> 18:01.081
break up the week.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.549
Did he seem believable?

18:02.583 --> 18:04.518
I couldn't really tell.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.453
He's not asking
for anything,

18:07.487 --> 18:09.155
which makes me suspect

18:09.189 --> 18:10.791
he's probably
telling the truth.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.396
So he is dead.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.531
My son.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.734
Part of me thought...

18:22.302 --> 18:24.938
...he was really
still alive somewhere.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.075
Hoped, I guess.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.647
Did you arrange a transport?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.416
All taken care of.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.451
Okay, Jenny,
you're still up first.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.854
Then we'll call
this Reynolds guy.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.603
(sighs)

18:56.637 --> 19:00.240
Jeez, Jimmy, I told you,
the timing--

19:00.273 --> 19:02.242
Can you help me
with anything?

19:02.275 --> 19:03.644
A couple of thousand?

19:03.677 --> 19:06.647
It's killing me,
but I can't.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.686
You okay?

19:13.520 --> 19:14.821
You don't look good.

19:19.660 --> 19:21.562
Tell me about
this horse.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.434
We were at the park.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.203
We used to go
every morning.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.138
It was Chad's
favorite thing to do.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.040
BOBBY: What would
your son do there?

19:34.074 --> 19:36.777
JENNY: He loved constructing
things in the sandbox,

19:36.810 --> 19:38.779
I guess like
any four-year-old.

19:38.812 --> 19:41.014
This day he was playing
with his Legos.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.448
And what
were you doing?

19:42.482 --> 19:45.051
I was watching him,
as well as my daughter Susan,

19:45.085 --> 19:46.152
who was on the swings.

19:46.787 --> 19:47.721
Then what happened?

19:47.754 --> 19:49.923
Susan fell off a swing
and hurt herself,

19:49.956 --> 19:51.191
and she was crying.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.893
I ran over
to see about her.

19:53.727 --> 19:55.495
Maybe 30 or 40 seconds.

19:57.097 --> 20:00.233
And when I looked back,
Chad was gone.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.768
BOBBY: While your
son was playing,

20:01.802 --> 20:03.970
did you see anybody else
in the area?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.907
I saw that man.
John Pierce?

20:06.940 --> 20:08.675
Yes. He was
at a water fountain

20:08.709 --> 20:11.077
about 20 feet away
from where Chad was playing.

20:11.111 --> 20:12.245
What was he doing?

20:12.278 --> 20:14.314
Just standing there
watching the children.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.916
Did that make you nervous?

20:15.949 --> 20:17.818
I really didn't
think about it.

20:17.851 --> 20:22.022
Um, I had seen him before.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.624
And he always seemed
a little weird,

20:23.657 --> 20:25.559
but none of us--
the mothers--

20:25.592 --> 20:27.060
knew he was
a child molester.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.128
Objection.

20:28.161 --> 20:29.362
I'll ignore it.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.198
After you noticed that
your son was gone,

20:32.232 --> 20:33.767
did you see Mr. Pierce?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.936
No. He was gone, too.

20:35.969 --> 20:38.304
It all happened
in seconds.

20:38.338 --> 20:42.375
Mrs. Baldwin, did you see
anyone else nearby

20:42.408 --> 20:43.977
who could have disappeared
with Chad

20:44.010 --> 20:46.379
in a matter of seconds?

20:46.412 --> 20:47.981
No.
Thank you.

20:54.988 --> 20:57.858
I'm very sorry about the loss
of your son, Mrs. Baldwin.

20:57.891 --> 21:00.694
Yes, you told me that.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.597
Mr. Pierce actually
worked at park, didn't he?

21:03.630 --> 21:04.765
Evidently.

21:04.798 --> 21:06.667
You said he seemed weird.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.402
Had you ever complained
about him to anyone?

21:09.435 --> 21:10.671
No.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.305
To your knowledge,
did any of the mothers

21:12.338 --> 21:14.074
ever complain about
Mr. Pierce's behavior

21:14.107 --> 21:15.576
toward their children?

21:15.609 --> 21:17.043
Not to my knowledge.

21:17.077 --> 21:18.478
Did you ever see him behave

21:18.512 --> 21:20.647
in a scary
or inappropriate manner

21:20.681 --> 21:22.816
around the children?

21:22.849 --> 21:25.318
He stared at them
sometimes.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.554
You never did see him
abduct your son, did you?

21:27.588 --> 21:30.490
I didn't see it, but--
So it could have been
somebody else.

21:30.524 --> 21:31.992
Nobody else was near Chad.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.527
How do you know?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.596
If Mr. Pierce could
disappear into the trees,

21:35.629 --> 21:37.698
someone else could've
been hiding in there,
couldn't they?

21:37.731 --> 21:39.432
It was him.

21:41.502 --> 21:44.204
It helps to have
somebody to blame,

21:44.237 --> 21:46.306
doesn't it, Mrs. Baldwin,

21:46.339 --> 21:48.408
to give the monster
a face,

21:48.441 --> 21:51.077
even if it's the wrong face?
Objection.

21:51.111 --> 21:54.080
Withdrawn.
That's all I have.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.595
Are you authorized to make
withdrawals from this account?

22:41.628 --> 22:43.797
I'm a lawyer
with the firm.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.532
I'm James Berluti.

22:45.566 --> 22:47.534
I should be
on record here.

22:47.568 --> 22:49.102
The manager knows me.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.872
Mr. Berluti, I'll just
have to get this approved.

22:51.905 --> 22:53.373
Fifteen thousand?
Yes.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.275
Okay, it'll just
take a second.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.727
We found three Legos
in his apartment.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.796
Did John Pierce tell you
how they got there?

23:15.829 --> 23:17.197
Yes. He said he had them

23:17.230 --> 23:18.799
for when his nephews
came over.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.767
Three Legos?
Yes.

23:20.801 --> 23:23.469
Three lone Legos?
That's correct.

23:23.504 --> 23:26.973
Did you determine
how often his nephews,
in fact, came over?

23:27.240 --> 23:30.811
We determined
he had no nephews.

23:30.844 --> 23:33.146
Were you ever able
to determine that the Legos

23:33.179 --> 23:35.281
you found in
Mr. Pierce's apartment

23:35.315 --> 23:36.817
belonged to Chad Baldwin?

23:37.518 --> 23:38.685
No, we were not.

23:38.719 --> 23:40.386
Any evidence
of Chad Baldwin

23:40.420 --> 23:42.656
ever being present
in my client's apartment?

23:42.689 --> 23:43.624
No.

23:43.657 --> 23:45.726
Any physical, testimonial,

23:45.759 --> 23:47.794
or forensic evidence
to suggest

23:47.828 --> 23:51.732
that Chad Baldwin ever came
in contact with John Pierce?

23:51.765 --> 23:53.399
Only the testimony
of the mother,

23:53.433 --> 23:55.168
who said she saw him
close to her son.

24:00.406 --> 24:02.643
I wish I could be
more optimistic.

24:02.676 --> 24:04.377
What about
the informant?

24:04.410 --> 24:07.480
He's going up next,
but his credibility...

24:10.083 --> 24:12.986
the only other thing
I can think of is
to call Pierce.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.221
If he doesn't take
the Fifth,

24:15.255 --> 24:16.790
maybe if I go at him
hard enough,

24:16.823 --> 24:19.325
he'll say something
to incriminate himself.

24:19.359 --> 24:23.263
Contrary to the myth,
not all child molesters
are rocket scientists.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.539
ANNOUNCER: Race number
eight will begin

24:32.573 --> 24:34.340
in approximately 15 minutes.

24:34.374 --> 24:37.477
Please proceed to the betting
window to place your bet.

24:37.511 --> 24:40.380
Twelve thousand
on number four--

24:40.413 --> 24:43.183
Maddie's Charm to win.

24:43.216 --> 24:46.620
A hundred dollar exacta wheel,
Maddie's Charm on top.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.556
And $2,000 to show.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.626
That's on number four.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.098
ANNOUNCER: Your
attention please.

24:58.131 --> 25:00.601
The photo results
of the last race
are now available.

25:07.007 --> 25:09.342
Eugene, this just came
through the fax.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.811
It's...

25:10.844 --> 25:12.278
What?

25:12.312 --> 25:14.981
A CTR form from the bank.

25:15.015 --> 25:17.150
There's been a withdrawal
from the Peterson account.

25:24.958 --> 25:28.228
Before we move on
to what Mr. Pierce said to you,

25:28.261 --> 25:30.030
can you tell me
how you feel about him?

25:30.731 --> 25:32.533
I can't stand him.

25:32.566 --> 25:34.367
I make no bones there.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.169
Why don't you like
Mr. Pierce?

25:36.202 --> 25:38.572
He told the CO
I had contraband in my cell,

25:38.605 --> 25:40.440
and I got put
in the hole for a few days.

25:40.473 --> 25:41.975
What kind of contraband?

25:42.008 --> 25:43.844
A hot plate.

25:43.877 --> 25:46.547
Are you a vindictive person,
Mr. Reynolds?

25:46.580 --> 25:49.015
Are you testifying
to get back at the defendant?

25:49.049 --> 25:51.552
No. I just think
he deserves to go down

25:51.585 --> 25:53.219
for what he did
to that Baldwin boy.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.421
All right.

25:55.455 --> 25:58.792
What, exactly,
did he tell you about that?

25:58.825 --> 26:01.528
He said-- and this is
pretty much of a quote--

26:01.562 --> 26:03.764
"I sure did enjoy
getting that boy out

26:03.797 --> 26:05.866
from under
his mama's nose.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.467
He was a real looker."

26:07.500 --> 26:09.936
Did he say who
he was talking about?

26:09.970 --> 26:12.438
He said that kid who was
snatched from the park--

26:12.472 --> 26:14.775
Chad Baldwin,
the one on the news.

26:14.808 --> 26:19.012
Did he tell you
he murdered Chad?

26:19.045 --> 26:21.047
He didn't use that word.

26:21.081 --> 26:22.883
He said he cleaned up
after himself,

26:22.916 --> 26:25.786
and that he regretted not
keeping the kid around longer

26:25.819 --> 26:27.220
'cause he was good.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.823
What was his demeanor
as he was telling you this?

26:30.924 --> 26:32.058
Sort of dreamy.

26:33.527 --> 26:36.229
The same look a man gets
when he's remembering a woman.

26:37.898 --> 26:39.432
ANNOUNCER: The horses
are at the gate.

26:39.465 --> 26:42.068
It's post time
for the race.

26:42.102 --> 26:43.504
(bell rings)

26:43.537 --> 26:45.405
(announcer chattering)

26:47.273 --> 26:49.209
(cheering)

26:57.718 --> 27:00.286
HENRIETTA: Did he ever
give you any specific
details of this crime?

27:00.320 --> 27:01.855
Just what I told you.

27:01.888 --> 27:04.124
Just that he did it.
And enjoyed it.

27:04.157 --> 27:06.527
Isn't it true
that you told Mr. Pierce

27:06.560 --> 27:07.794
you were gonna
get even with him?

27:07.828 --> 27:09.195
No, it's not.

27:09.229 --> 27:11.397
What are you serving
a sentence for, Mr. Reynolds?

27:11.431 --> 27:13.499
Embezzlement and assault.

27:13.534 --> 27:16.036
So we can safely assume
you are both a dishonest

27:16.069 --> 27:18.038
and a violent person,
can we not?

27:18.071 --> 27:20.306
I am telling
the truth here.

27:20.340 --> 27:22.943
You even have a reputation
in prison for being
a snitch, don't you?

27:22.976 --> 27:23.910
Undeserved.

27:23.944 --> 27:26.012
Makes sense that
Mr. Pierce would confess

27:26.046 --> 27:28.014
to a known snitch, doesn't it?

27:28.048 --> 27:30.551
Well, I find
pedophiles lack judgment.

27:32.986 --> 27:35.388
(cheering)

27:36.389 --> 27:37.624
Move it!

27:37.658 --> 27:38.792
Move it, four!

27:38.825 --> 27:40.326
Come on, four, move it!

27:40.861 --> 27:42.162
Whip him, Jorge!

27:42.195 --> 27:43.930
Come on, Jorge, whip him, baby!

27:43.964 --> 27:45.799
Come on, baby!
Come on, four!

27:45.832 --> 27:47.200
Make your move, four!

27:47.233 --> 27:48.869
Run him, baby! Run him, baby!

27:48.902 --> 27:50.971
Get inside! Get inside!

27:51.004 --> 27:52.939
Go, baby, go! That's it!

27:52.973 --> 27:54.174
Come on now!

27:54.207 --> 27:56.643
Jorge, bring it around!
Bring it inside!

27:56.677 --> 27:58.545
Go home, baby!
Bring it home, four!

27:58.579 --> 28:00.614
Come on, four!
Come on, baby!

28:00.647 --> 28:02.282
Come on! Come on! Come on!

28:02.315 --> 28:03.684
Four! Four!

28:03.717 --> 28:06.019
Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

28:06.052 --> 28:07.420
Go! Go! Four!

28:07.453 --> 28:09.455
Four! Four!
Oh, come on, baby!

28:09.489 --> 28:11.157
Oh, come on, four!

28:11.191 --> 28:12.826
(screaming)

28:13.694 --> 28:15.328
(panting)

28:15.361 --> 28:16.830
(crowd cheering)

28:17.564 --> 28:18.665
I won.

28:24.037 --> 28:25.338
I won.

28:27.808 --> 28:29.475
Anything else, Mr. Donnell?

28:29.510 --> 28:32.779
Yes, Your Honor.
We call John Pierce
to the stand.

28:32.813 --> 28:35.315
Objection.
Mr. Donnell knows full well

28:35.348 --> 28:36.783
I'm not about
to allow that to happen.

28:36.817 --> 28:39.720
This is a civil proceeding.
I can call whoev--

28:39.753 --> 28:41.387
And if criminal charges
could follow,

28:41.421 --> 28:43.423
my client is allowed to assert
his Fifth Amendment right

28:43.456 --> 28:45.458
not to testify,
and my advice for him

28:45.491 --> 28:46.993
to do exactly that
won't be subtle.

28:47.027 --> 28:49.129
Given that 18 years
have passed,

28:49.162 --> 28:51.665
the likelihood that criminal
charges will be brought--

28:51.698 --> 28:54.000
We're not talking likelihoods.
There's still a chance.

28:54.034 --> 28:58.204
This man is a convicted
child molester.

28:58.238 --> 28:59.640
He was seen
and identified

28:59.673 --> 29:01.642
as being within 50 feet
of the victim

29:01.675 --> 29:03.443
at the time
of the kidnapping.

29:03.476 --> 29:06.713
Chad Baldwin was playing
with Legos at the time.

29:06.747 --> 29:09.415
Legos were found
in that bastard's apartment.

29:09.449 --> 29:11.351
Objection!
Mr. Donnell.

29:12.285 --> 29:14.988
We all know
we can't get him criminally.

29:15.021 --> 29:18.024
At least give us a chance
to get him civilly.

29:18.058 --> 29:19.192
Counsel, step up.

29:25.799 --> 29:27.534
First, Mr. Donnell,

29:27.568 --> 29:29.970
as much as I admire
your passion,

29:30.003 --> 29:32.773
you are not exactly known
as a champion of fair play,

29:32.806 --> 29:35.942
so I would delete
the moral indignation

29:35.976 --> 29:39.079
from your repertoire.

29:39.112 --> 29:42.583
Now, Ms. Lightstone.

29:42.616 --> 29:46.152
True, your client does not
have to testify here,

29:46.186 --> 29:49.089
but if he doesn't,
you might not like my finding.

29:49.122 --> 29:51.558
My client is judgment-proof.
I'm not terribly concerned--

29:51.592 --> 29:53.694
I am not talking
about civil liability.

29:53.727 --> 29:55.095
What are
you talking about?

29:55.128 --> 29:58.198
You're a good lawyer, Henrietta.
Figure it out.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.500
As a convicted pedophile,

30:00.534 --> 30:02.368
your client
can be kept in jail

30:02.402 --> 30:04.370
even after his sentence
has expired

30:04.404 --> 30:06.840
if he's considered
to be a danger to society.

30:06.873 --> 30:09.643
He has already satisfied
the psychiatrists that he's not.

30:09.676 --> 30:12.879
Yes. They consider him
to be rehabilitated,

30:12.913 --> 30:14.715
full of remorse.

30:14.748 --> 30:16.316
Well, from where I sit--

30:16.349 --> 30:18.652
and I tend to like
the view up here--

30:18.685 --> 30:20.486
I'm not getting that picture.

30:21.522 --> 30:24.357
If he refuses to testify,

30:24.390 --> 30:25.626
that makes me concerned

30:25.659 --> 30:28.061
as to whether
he has truly reformed.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.029
What are you saying?

30:29.062 --> 30:31.632
I want to hear from him.

30:31.665 --> 30:32.766
Otherwise,

30:32.799 --> 30:34.400
the District Attorney's office

30:34.434 --> 30:36.637
might want to bring
civil commitment proceedings,

30:36.670 --> 30:38.672
and your client
may never get out.

30:38.705 --> 30:40.206
This is blackmail.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.309
I'm just pointing
out risks, counsel.

30:43.343 --> 30:45.679
So if my client
refuses to testify,

30:45.712 --> 30:46.880
you can find him
uncooperative

30:46.913 --> 30:48.481
and recommend
he stay locked up forever,

30:48.515 --> 30:49.983
and if he testifies
and slips up,

30:50.016 --> 30:51.585
he could stay
locked up forever.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.187
Choose your poison.

31:02.095 --> 31:03.930
Now we have our leverage.

31:03.964 --> 31:06.967
He's got a strong incentive
to tell us where the body is

31:07.000 --> 31:08.068
if it'll stop this train.

31:08.101 --> 31:10.070
There's no way
they want to risk testifying.

31:10.103 --> 31:12.673
If he did testify,
do you think you could get him?

31:12.706 --> 31:14.741
I should be able to shake him
enough to give spindle doubts.

31:14.775 --> 31:16.577
That's what they have to
be afraid of now.

31:16.610 --> 31:19.279
He's not just risking
criminal prosecution.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.681
If he plays dodgeball
with me,

31:20.714 --> 31:22.683
the DA could argue
he's not rehabilitated

31:22.716 --> 31:24.818
and seek involuntary
confinement.

31:24.851 --> 31:27.453
It's civil,
but prison is prison.

31:27.487 --> 31:29.355
We got him
in the crossfire now.

31:29.389 --> 31:31.424
Our leverage is great.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.193
Now's the time
to go back to them.

31:33.226 --> 31:34.360
With what?

31:34.394 --> 31:36.396
Well, if he tells us
where the remains are,

31:36.429 --> 31:39.132
we drop our claim,
he gets his freedom...

31:41.101 --> 31:43.336
...and you get to have
a funeral for your son.

31:46.372 --> 31:47.508
No.

31:57.417 --> 31:59.886
Why not?
Jenny?

31:59.920 --> 32:00.987
What's wrong?

32:02.689 --> 32:05.726
Bobby, you asked us
at the beginning
why we hired you.

32:07.060 --> 32:08.729
And I gave you
an honest answer--

32:08.762 --> 32:11.932
that we wanted closure.

32:11.965 --> 32:13.033
BOBBY: And?

32:13.066 --> 32:16.236
And sitting here
right now...

32:16.269 --> 32:19.139
I don't know,
faced with the possibility
that he could go free,

32:19.172 --> 32:20.473
I suddenly realize...

32:21.542 --> 32:23.710
I want vengeance more.

32:23.744 --> 32:25.646
Jenny.
If the choice is

32:25.679 --> 32:27.480
get the body back
and he goes free

32:27.514 --> 32:30.383
versus don't get the body
and he rots in jail,

32:30.416 --> 32:32.018
I choose that he rots.

32:37.591 --> 32:38.825
Are you sure?

32:40.627 --> 32:42.162
I want him to rot.

32:52.873 --> 32:54.675
EUGENE: Jimmy.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.042
Can I see you
for a minute?

33:03.950 --> 33:05.251
Shut the door.

33:10.624 --> 33:11.692
What's up?

33:16.697 --> 33:19.465
Yeah, it's a withdrawal slip.
What about it?

33:22.302 --> 33:24.505
What do you need
$15,000 for?

33:26.372 --> 33:28.308
I had some expenses
on the Peterson case.

33:28.341 --> 33:30.343
You're not
a good liar, Jimmy.

33:30.376 --> 33:31.512
What's going on?

33:34.314 --> 33:35.849
Okay.

33:35.882 --> 33:38.652
I had a personal
emergency, all right?

33:38.685 --> 33:41.087
The money's already back.
I just came from the bank.

33:41.121 --> 33:44.057
So you think that's that.

33:47.460 --> 33:50.797
Look, Eugene,
I got in a jam with a bookie.

33:50.831 --> 33:52.733
I borrowed money
for, like, seven hours.

33:52.766 --> 33:54.367
You stole money.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.402
You took
from a client's trust fund.

33:56.436 --> 33:58.672
That's theft.

33:58.705 --> 34:02.442
I'm sorry. I-It was
a one-time situation.

34:02.475 --> 34:05.078
Can we just let it go?
No.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.913
We can't.

34:06.947 --> 34:08.849
This affects
the entire firm.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.585
I got to bring it
to Bobby.

34:11.618 --> 34:14.721
Please, just don't do that.
Please.

34:14.755 --> 34:17.489
Eugene, please.

34:32.706 --> 34:34.440
Oh, Jimmy.

34:35.341 --> 34:36.610
Eugene wants to see you.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.598
I paid it all back
within six hours,
plus interest.

34:57.631 --> 35:01.334
By law, we're required
to notify the client
and the Bar.

35:02.435 --> 35:03.804
You do that, I'm dead.

35:03.837 --> 35:06.139
If I don't, this whole firm
could get disbarred!

35:06.172 --> 35:08.041
Bobby, I could go to jail.

35:08.074 --> 35:09.042
Whose fault is that?

35:09.075 --> 35:11.377
Look, Bobby, I'm done.

35:11.411 --> 35:12.779
You've said that before.

35:12.813 --> 35:14.681
I'm done! You have my word.

35:14.715 --> 35:16.950
I'm supposed to risk
everybody's reputation,

35:16.983 --> 35:20.153
risk this firm,
on the word of an addict?

35:20.186 --> 35:24.457
I'm not an addict!

35:24.490 --> 35:25.992
I'm due in court.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.595
What's gonna happen?
I don't know.

35:41.007 --> 35:42.108
Thanks a lot.

35:47.914 --> 35:49.916
This affects everybody,
Jimmy.

35:52.285 --> 35:53.419
Try to get that.

36:04.330 --> 36:08.969
Mr. Pierce,
if you didn't kidnap
Chad Baldwin,

36:09.002 --> 36:10.003
who did?

36:10.036 --> 36:11.471
I do not know.

36:11.505 --> 36:12.539
Do you care?

36:12.573 --> 36:15.942
Of course I care,
but it wasn't me.

36:15.976 --> 36:17.978
You've already told a lie,
haven't you,

36:18.011 --> 36:19.279
on my second question?

36:19.312 --> 36:20.981
Objection.
Sustained.

36:21.014 --> 36:24.484
You cared when Chad Baldwin
was kidnapped?

36:24.518 --> 36:27.988
Mr. Donnell,
I had a sexual problem

36:28.021 --> 36:31.357
for which I received both
treatment and medication,

36:31.391 --> 36:35.228
but I have never been
a person without compassion.

36:35.261 --> 36:37.363
BOBBY: So when
a four-year-old disappears,

36:37.397 --> 36:39.733
you would feel compassion.

36:39.766 --> 36:40.801
Yes.

36:40.834 --> 36:43.504
Would you bother to help
if you could?

36:44.270 --> 36:45.706
Because I'm curious.

36:45.739 --> 36:49.042
You were there at the time,
seen less than 50 feet away,

36:49.075 --> 36:50.911
you even knew the victim.

36:50.944 --> 36:52.412
Why didn't you go forward
to the police

36:52.445 --> 36:54.047
as a possible witness?

36:54.080 --> 36:56.482
Because I didn't see
anything.

36:56.517 --> 36:57.951
How do you know?

36:57.984 --> 37:01.187
Maybe there was something you
saw seemingly irrelevant to you,

37:01.221 --> 37:03.757
but it could've provided
a clue to them.

37:03.790 --> 37:06.793
Why didn't you at least say,
"Hey, how can I help?"

37:06.827 --> 37:10.531
Look, I was afraid
they'd suspect me.

37:10.564 --> 37:12.065
Why?

37:12.098 --> 37:14.367
At this point,
your record was clean.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.136
Why would they suspect you?

37:16.169 --> 37:18.438
You didn't molest those other
three boys till after.

37:18.471 --> 37:20.173
Objection.
Sustained.

37:20.206 --> 37:22.108
Your work shift
went to 4:00 p. m.,

37:22.142 --> 37:24.745
but I see, on this day,
you left early.

37:24.778 --> 37:27.247
I didn't feel well.
You didn't feel well.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.816
Did you go to a supervisor
to say you were leaving?

37:29.850 --> 37:31.985
No. I just went home.

37:32.018 --> 37:34.555
Coincidentally, you left
within 30 to 40 seconds

37:34.588 --> 37:37.524
of the time
Chad Baldwin disappeared.

37:37.558 --> 37:40.260
Can you account
for such a coincidence?

37:40.293 --> 37:42.963
A soon-to-be-convicted
child molester

37:42.996 --> 37:45.298
is within 50 feet
of a child

37:45.331 --> 37:47.968
at the exact time
he's kidnapped?

37:48.001 --> 37:50.604
Objection!
Withdrawn.

37:50.637 --> 37:51.805
Why did you leave
the state?

37:51.838 --> 37:54.307
I cooperated completely
with the police

37:54.340 --> 37:55.876
before I left the state.

37:55.909 --> 37:57.243
Why did you leave, sir?

37:57.277 --> 38:00.280
Because I expected
to get the same bias

38:00.313 --> 38:02.382
from everybody
that I'm getting from you.

38:02.415 --> 38:04.417
So you ran.
Yes.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.320
Tell us about those Legos.
Why'd you tell the police

38:07.353 --> 38:09.990
the Legos were for nephews
you didn't have?

38:10.023 --> 38:13.760
I lied.
As I said, I knew they
thought that I was guilty.

38:13.794 --> 38:16.663
So you lied.
Yes.

38:16.697 --> 38:18.932
Why didn't you tell them
the truth?

38:18.965 --> 38:22.869
Because I didn't remember
when I got the Legos.

38:22.903 --> 38:24.938
So you decided to say
you had nephews.

38:24.971 --> 38:25.939
Yes.

38:26.406 --> 38:28.642
What happened
to Chad Baldwin?

38:28.675 --> 38:30.010
I don't know.

38:30.043 --> 38:31.111
Do you care?

38:31.144 --> 38:33.479
I said, I care.

38:33.514 --> 38:36.482
Because you have compassion.

38:36.517 --> 38:40.020
Can you feel for his parents
sitting over there?

38:40.053 --> 38:42.355
Yes!
Can you understand
how they would love

38:42.388 --> 38:43.557
to get their son's remains

38:43.590 --> 38:45.526
so they can get
some kind of closure?

38:45.559 --> 38:47.661
Can you understand that?
Yes.

38:47.694 --> 38:49.896
Would you be willing
to help them if you could?

38:49.930 --> 38:51.497
Yes, but I can't.

38:51.532 --> 38:56.402
Well, even peace of mind that
you didn't take their son--

38:56.436 --> 38:58.104
would you be willing
to give them that?

38:58.138 --> 39:01.007
I'm trying right now.
I appreciate that.

39:01.041 --> 39:03.176
Would you be willing
to take a polygraph?

39:03.209 --> 39:04.811
Objection.
I'm not talking about

39:04.845 --> 39:07.080
using it for criminal purposes.

39:07.113 --> 39:09.516
A private polygraph
just between parties,

39:09.550 --> 39:14.621
just to satisfy my clients
that you didn't take their son.

39:14.655 --> 39:17.457
Would you be willing to do that
so they can just move on?

39:17.490 --> 39:19.726
Those things
aren't foolproof.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.262
Understood.
Would you be willing?

39:22.295 --> 39:24.297
I don't care if he's willing.
I won't allow it.

39:24.330 --> 39:27.500
Whatever your lawyer advises
or recommends,

39:27.534 --> 39:30.804
John, it's ultimately
your decision.

39:31.972 --> 39:34.474
Will you take
that polygraph?

39:34.508 --> 39:35.542
No.

39:35.576 --> 39:38.545
Because I don't trust them
to be reliable.

39:39.713 --> 39:42.015
And you insist
on reliability.

39:42.048 --> 39:43.383
HENRIETTA: Objection!

39:45.051 --> 39:46.186
Nothing further.

39:50.123 --> 39:51.958
All right, Mr. Pierce,
you may step down.

39:53.660 --> 39:55.796
Mr. Donnell,
any other witnesses?

39:55.829 --> 39:57.631
No, Your Honor.
Ms. Lightstone?

39:57.664 --> 39:59.465
No, but I'd like
to be heard.

39:59.499 --> 40:00.667
I'm not interested.

40:01.902 --> 40:03.737
All right.

40:03.770 --> 40:06.039
If the defendant
was not involved

40:06.072 --> 40:08.374
in the disappearance
of Chad Baldwin,

40:08.408 --> 40:12.813
then we have to assume
there was another
skulking child molester

40:12.846 --> 40:15.081
who happened to be hiding
behind a tree

40:15.115 --> 40:17.150
in the same area
at the same time.

40:18.785 --> 40:22.022
Mr. Pierce, you look
pretty guilty to me.

40:22.055 --> 40:24.791
But as for evidence,
that's all there is.

40:24.825 --> 40:26.927
You were there
at the time and place.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.262
Admittedly, your job required
you to be there.

40:31.765 --> 40:33.399
I'm gonna let this case
go forward,

40:33.433 --> 40:36.269
but, Mr. Donnell,
if you don't come up with more,

40:36.302 --> 40:38.338
I will be dismissing it
at a later date.

40:38.371 --> 40:39.773
What about recommending

40:39.806 --> 40:41.207
to the District Attorney's
Office

40:41.241 --> 40:42.843
that they file
for civil commitment?

40:45.411 --> 40:47.013
I can't recommend
a man's freedom

40:47.047 --> 40:49.516
be taken away
based on suspicion alone.

40:51.217 --> 40:52.553
We're adjourned.

41:05.532 --> 41:06.700
I'm sorry.

41:07.901 --> 41:09.970
Is it over?

41:10.003 --> 41:12.205
No. If the wrongful death
action survives,

41:12.238 --> 41:14.775
we can keep digging,

41:14.808 --> 41:17.410
but there's no money
to be won.

41:17.443 --> 41:19.045
And as for keeping him
in jail

41:19.079 --> 41:21.882
or finding the whereabouts
of your son's remains...

41:24.050 --> 41:25.151
...we struck out.

41:27.821 --> 41:29.322
I'm very sorry.

41:29.355 --> 41:31.357
You did your best.

41:31.391 --> 41:32.492
Perhaps a wiser lawyer

41:32.526 --> 41:34.895
would've steered you away
from all this.

41:35.696 --> 41:37.764
We wouldn't let you.

41:37.798 --> 41:38.999
You tried.

42:02.756 --> 42:04.124
Mr. Donnell?

42:04.157 --> 42:05.291
Yes.

42:05.325 --> 42:07.594
I'm James Tucker,
and this is my mother.

42:09.763 --> 42:10.964
How can I help you?

42:10.997 --> 42:13.199
We've been following
the Pierce trial in the news,

42:13.233 --> 42:15.669
and we need to talk
to somebody.

42:16.637 --> 42:17.804
About what?

42:20.907 --> 42:22.576
I think I may be
Chad Baldwin.

42:33.053 --> 42:34.655
TV ANNOUNCER: Hakim is
back to receive

42:34.688 --> 42:37.658
Hakim has had a problem
holding on to the ball.

42:40.426 --> 42:42.262
Both last year and
in pre-season,

42:42.295 --> 42:43.964
really one of the best
in the league.

42:43.997 --> 42:45.498
Tremendous kick.

42:45.532 --> 42:48.301
Hakim fields it back
at the 15 yard line...

42:49.803 --> 42:52.573
Hakim and only
the punter to beat!

42:52.606 --> 42:54.007
And knocked him down!

42:54.040 --> 42:56.242
He'll go all the way
for a touchdown!

42:56.276 --> 42:58.745
The punter was...

42:58.779 --> 43:00.714
No way!

43:00.747 --> 43:02.516
(crowd roaring)

43:30.110 --> 43:32.946
(music playing)

43:56.502 --> 43:57.538
You stinker!
