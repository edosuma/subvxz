WEBVTT

00:25.276 --> 00:26.319
More.

00:29.114 --> 00:30.240
More.

00:31.408 --> 00:34.369
Can't keep my boy
from his avocado.

00:35.078 --> 00:37.747
How proud you must be. Delightful child.

00:39.958 --> 00:41.000
Hilter.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.423
I've gotta duck out
for a couple of hours this afternoon.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.803
Cover for me if my wife calls.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.388
Again, <i>Herr</i> Marty?

00:53.847 --> 00:54.973
My groin elixir.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.142
Puts a little rev in the engine,
know what I mean?

00:57.225 --> 00:58.393
<i>Ja</i>. Yes.

00:58.476 --> 00:59.728
Which is good

00:59.811 --> 01:01.187
'cause I got me a rendezvous

01:01.271 --> 01:02.814
with a hot little number
I met at the Target.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.192
- The restaurant'll be empty.
- Just gotta tap that, you know?

01:06.276 --> 01:07.485
<i>Ja,</i> I understand.

01:08.153 --> 01:10.447
You tap your hot number,
I will watch the store.

01:10.530 --> 01:11.740
Good man.

01:18.455 --> 01:20.248
Well, time for my break.

01:26.171 --> 01:27.630
Half a mile away?

01:27.714 --> 01:30.759
That's not employee parking,
that's a message.

01:30.842 --> 01:32.218
That's "Go F yourselves."

01:32.302 --> 01:34.220
So's a 35 cent an hour raise.

01:34.304 --> 01:36.389
I mean,
what am I supposed to do with that?

01:37.766 --> 01:38.850
What do you think, David?

01:44.189 --> 01:47.650
I have been to Hell <i>und</i> back.

01:49.569 --> 01:55.992
If you're asking me what I think is
the answer to all that bothers you,

01:56.493 --> 02:02.749
from inconvenient employee parking to
low wages, to how fat you people are,

02:02.832 --> 02:06.085
the answer to me is, simply put...

02:07.962 --> 02:09.339
Is the Jews.

02:10.465 --> 02:11.466
My boss is a Jew.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.051
Of course he is.

02:13.134 --> 02:14.427
She.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.766
The bourgeois people

02:19.849 --> 02:21.726
used to ask me

02:21.810 --> 02:25.563
why a revolution would be necessary.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.528
The structure of your State

02:32.445 --> 02:35.490
and methods of government are foreign

02:36.074 --> 02:40.954
to your national character and needs.

02:42.288 --> 02:45.208
A critical situation

02:45.750 --> 02:48.253
cannot be made better

02:48.670 --> 02:54.759
and cannot be fixed by working together

02:57.720 --> 02:59.973
except by

03:00.723 --> 03:05.061
a radical extermination!

03:08.064 --> 03:09.065
Totally.

03:30.879 --> 03:32.088
Hitler.

03:36.676 --> 03:38.261
Satan sent you?

03:40.597 --> 03:43.349
Well, it is good timing, actually.

03:44.309 --> 03:46.978
I have just got my four-year plan
off the ground,

03:48.938 --> 03:51.900
and I have not yet decided on
an Interior Minister.

03:51.983 --> 03:55.778
You see, I have heard of you,
<i>mein Kumpel.</i>

03:55.862 --> 03:58.031
I could use someone with your gifts.

03:59.157 --> 04:01.784
The world is ripe for a new Reich.

04:01.868 --> 04:03.119
Why go back?

04:03.870 --> 04:06.581
I have made
such progress in a short time.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.795
Oh, please, not now.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.632
The Zionist world government
must be stopped.

04:19.344 --> 04:20.637
Oh, great.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.389
What are you looking at?

04:24.015 --> 04:25.600
I should never have let you out.

04:29.437 --> 04:32.106
All right, Hilter.
If Doris calls...

04:32.190 --> 04:33.191
Uh...

04:35.526 --> 04:36.653
What's going on?

04:36.736 --> 04:38.988
I fear they want
to take me back to Hell.

04:43.076 --> 04:44.369
You can't do...

04:48.456 --> 04:50.917
I am not going back!

04:51.501 --> 04:53.211
I have too much to do!

04:55.004 --> 04:57.131
I am not going back!

06:36.647 --> 06:37.648
I'm sorry.

06:39.525 --> 06:40.526
Me, too.

07:08.721 --> 07:09.764
Starr.

07:09.847 --> 07:10.890
Messiah.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.975
Welcome back to Angelville.

07:23.903 --> 07:26.280
You see, the thing people
forget about the '60s

07:26.364 --> 07:28.032
is how iffy the drugs were, you know?

07:28.199 --> 07:30.618
And that's why I had such
a rough go at Woodstock.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.078
Right, let's have a look.

07:32.954 --> 07:34.622
Purple ball, corner pocket.

07:35.581 --> 07:36.582
Intriguing.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.543
Christ.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.170
No, Kevin, you're screwing it up.

07:41.254 --> 07:42.672
You've gotta twist
and you've gotta turn.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.216
Twisting and turning. Twist and turn.

07:45.550 --> 07:48.719
Twist... That's it.
Oh, well done, man. Yeah.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.888
I dropped acid at breakfast, right,

07:51.055 --> 07:53.182
and by the time
Ravi Shankar got onstage,

07:53.432 --> 07:55.184
I was seeing bloody monsters crying
like a bloody Englishman,

07:55.268 --> 07:56.269
you know what I mean?

07:56.352 --> 07:58.396
The point is,
what I'm trying to tell you

07:58.563 --> 08:02.525
is it's no use getting soppy
about how good things used to be.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.111
Most times, today is better.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.613
All right?
Right, let's have a look here.

08:08.239 --> 08:11.075
Number 13, corner pocket. Bollocks.

08:11.742 --> 08:12.910
<i>Ça va, mes enfants?</i>

08:13.244 --> 08:14.537
<i>Ça va,</i> my Lord.

08:16.247 --> 08:17.540
Let me show you something.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.084
All right. Ha.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.342
Oh.

08:29.427 --> 08:30.928
Those are some big coffins. Huh?

08:31.387 --> 08:34.182
Standard size, New Orleans.

08:35.725 --> 08:38.519
That one is for you.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.354
If you'd like.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.815
You sleep in a coffin?

08:48.196 --> 08:50.865
It's, uh, Persian silk velvet.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.994
It's the vampire way.
Has been for millennia.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.954
Right, well,
it might be your vampire way,

08:57.038 --> 08:59.582
but my vampire way is beanbag chairs
and bathroom floors.

08:59.665 --> 09:00.666
You know what I mean?

09:01.459 --> 09:04.003
Well, you know,
if you should change your mind.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.171
Well, thank you though, man.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.465
You know what,
it's really thoughtful. Thank you.

09:07.632 --> 09:10.426
There was another thing
that I needed to mention.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.762
There will be another
blood ceremony tonight.

09:13.512 --> 09:16.432
Lisa has been chosen,
and I know she would consider it

09:16.515 --> 09:19.060
a great honor if you would be
the one who brought her...

09:19.143 --> 09:21.812
Look, I already told you.
Turning people, it's not my thing.

09:21.896 --> 09:23.314
Because of what happened with your son?

09:23.397 --> 09:25.775
No. You guys, you do what you
need to do to get your rocks off.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.401
They're consenting adults.

09:28.194 --> 09:30.404
It's a free country, kind of.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.908
In my experience, nothing ever good
came from making more of us.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.576
That's all.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.620
Fly! Fly! Fly!

09:37.703 --> 09:41.666
You couldn't be more wrong.

09:45.294 --> 09:46.963
Deng Vuong.

09:48.714 --> 09:49.840
The day has come.

09:50.925 --> 09:53.302
It's your time to fly!

09:53.594 --> 09:57.139
Fly! Fly! Fly!

09:57.974 --> 09:58.975
It's been real, y'all.

10:09.568 --> 10:12.154
I don't think Deng's gonna get much
lift with all that luggage and all.

10:12.738 --> 10:16.117
He's not literally going to fly, silly.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.327
Eccarius is taking him to the airport.

10:18.744 --> 10:19.745
Why?

10:20.496 --> 10:22.665
- Deng's going on his mission work.
- What?

10:22.999 --> 10:24.667
To make the world safer for us.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.255
He's going where we all go
when it's our time to fly.

10:30.256 --> 10:32.591
To open a new chapter of Les Enfants.

10:33.092 --> 10:34.093
For 50 years,

10:34.176 --> 10:37.054
Eccarius has been sending us
all over the world as ambassadors.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.974
To change the hearts
of those who hate us,

10:40.474 --> 10:42.643
to turn those who
would join us in our fight,

10:43.019 --> 10:45.813
all the while creating
a network of safe havens

10:45.896 --> 10:48.232
in a world that still seeks to harm us.

10:49.275 --> 10:51.694
Eccarius likes to say,
"They don't hate us.

10:52.236 --> 10:56.198
<i>"They hate themselves,
and we're a convenient vessel."</i>

10:56.282 --> 11:00.119
But now, no one will have to live
in fear of persecution anymore.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.079
<i>It's Eccarius' dream.</i>

11:02.747 --> 11:04.206
<i>To provide a sanctuary.</i>

11:04.957 --> 11:06.792
<i>To give anyone like you,</i>

11:07.501 --> 11:09.253
<i>and soon, me,</i>

11:10.296 --> 11:11.297
<i>a home.</i>

11:12.965 --> 11:14.633
Christ, Eccarius did all that?

11:16.135 --> 11:17.136
Cool, right?

11:20.639 --> 11:22.016
Yeah, it is cool.

11:31.442 --> 11:32.943
This is interesting.

11:33.027 --> 11:34.528
Well, I'll cut right to it.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.282
I owe a debt to Gran'ma.

11:38.366 --> 11:39.992
And I will pay it down.

11:40.493 --> 11:42.745
If she will allow me to borrow you.

11:43.287 --> 11:47.500
I need your grandson's help
in resolving a business dispute.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.961
And what is your business, Mr. Starr?

11:51.837 --> 11:53.798
It's quite hum-drum, actually.

11:53.881 --> 11:57.635
Public relations, crisis management,
that kind of thing.

11:58.052 --> 11:59.762
But we have resources,

11:59.845 --> 12:02.598
so I am both able and prepared

12:02.681 --> 12:05.893
to make his temporary release
worth your while.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.230
We could, uh, rebuild your business.

12:09.939 --> 12:14.026
Restore your charming cottage
here to its former glories.

12:14.110 --> 12:17.238
I noticed your slave quarters are empty.

12:21.951 --> 12:23.202
We could change that.

12:29.166 --> 12:33.170
Or if you wanted to leave
the 19th century behind,

12:33.254 --> 12:37.091
what about a television program?

12:37.174 --> 12:42.304
<i>The Down Home Witching Hour
with Voodoo Granny,</i> or some such?

12:42.388 --> 12:46.976
That's easy. That's an e-mail.

13:00.489 --> 13:03.117
I want souls.

13:05.828 --> 13:06.871
Of course.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.924
It's me, sir.
I hope you're sitting down.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.386
I believe I'm about
to secure your leverage.

13:41.906 --> 13:44.742
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

13:45.493 --> 13:47.703
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.247
What would you like to confess,
my child?

13:54.919 --> 13:57.838
I've been thinking I want
to wear Miley Cyrus' skin

13:59.089 --> 14:00.132
like a pelt.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.168
Monsignor.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.549
I wanna catch a vampire.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.995
I'm pretty good with wounds, you know.

15:11.704 --> 15:13.080
Hmm.

15:14.415 --> 15:18.836
Oh, not to brag, but I once...

15:19.587 --> 15:25.676
I once took a pig's heart
and I put it into an Irish setter.

15:27.094 --> 15:30.097
The dog didn't die for two whole days.

15:32.016 --> 15:34.935
I can probably help you with that nose.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.688
Thanks, it's fine.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.899
Yeah, barely notice it.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.110
What happened?

15:43.736 --> 15:47.406
Snake bite? Nostril cancer?

15:47.615 --> 15:48.907
Some bitch sucker-punched me.

15:49.742 --> 15:52.286
Can't be a sucker punch
if you saw it coming.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.871
Who said I saw it coming?

15:57.207 --> 15:59.251
I'm missing gator season for this shit?

15:59.418 --> 16:01.712
Well, they've been in there,
like, forever.

16:02.671 --> 16:03.672
Ten minutes.

16:05.174 --> 16:06.342
It feel like longer.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.636
Anyway, it all worked out in the end.

16:09.762 --> 16:12.973
Some problems,
like getting Genesis back,

16:14.058 --> 16:15.726
are too big for someone like you.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.561
You were smart to call us.

16:17.645 --> 16:19.563
You were smart to come when we called.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.816
You need us a hell of a lot more
than we need you.

16:24.610 --> 16:25.944
What's a Genesis?

16:26.904 --> 16:27.905
- A band.
- A band.

16:28.322 --> 16:30.115
And we need Jesse, not you.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.161
The way I see it,
he doesn't need you either.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.288
Without you screwing up
for the 19th time,

16:36.372 --> 16:38.582
Jesse would've been out of this mess
a long time ago.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.544
Maybe that's his thing?
Screw-ups who sucker punch.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.051
Love is weird.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.053
Yeah.

16:51.512 --> 16:52.554
Recognize that?

16:55.891 --> 16:57.393
Soul Happy Go Go.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.269
The world's largest soul retailer.

16:59.353 --> 17:00.729
The Japanese.

17:02.398 --> 17:04.400
Sabina must've
been in business with 'em.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.904
A man with your resources,

17:10.406 --> 17:11.949
you must have contacts there.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.117
Of course I do. The Grail owns it.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.537
Warehouse in Osaka...

17:19.748 --> 17:20.874
I see.

17:21.791 --> 17:25.503
I could easily make that happen.

17:26.255 --> 17:27.964
Good. Do it.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.593
Then you can borrow him.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.764
Unfortunately, I'm on a time crunch.

17:36.557 --> 17:40.144
I'll have an infiltration unit
en route to Japan in two hours,

17:40.227 --> 17:42.271
but I need Jesse now.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.565
Gran'ma, they must
have hundreds of souls there.

17:44.648 --> 17:47.109
Millions, actually.
I've seen the warehouse pictures.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.653
It's like
Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompa Room.

17:49.737 --> 17:52.781
Hear that? A lifetime of souls.

17:57.286 --> 18:00.539
I love him. More than anything.

18:01.498 --> 18:04.209
But if you don't get me what I want,

18:04.877 --> 18:10.174
I'll make sure he's of no use
to you or anyone, ever.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.887
I don't foresee any problems.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.643
Yeah, me either.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.233
What is it?

18:37.951 --> 18:40.579
Flufferman, enough with
the roughhousing.

18:43.749 --> 18:46.251
Pack a bag. You're going to Osaka.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.338
She is your infiltration unit?

18:49.421 --> 18:50.714
I don't have a deep bench.

18:50.798 --> 18:53.175
Just her and someone even less.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.426
And for a job like this...

18:54.510 --> 18:55.636
Well, you just said it'd be easy.

18:55.719 --> 18:57.012
I lied to get what I wanted.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.180
You do that a lot, don't you?

18:58.263 --> 18:59.598
No more
than industry standard.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.558
Well, I don't like your industry, Starr.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.393
You lie to me again,
I'll give you two ugly eyes.

19:04.228 --> 19:06.855
Change of plan.
Tulip, you're going to Osaka.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.440
Excuse me?

19:10.025 --> 19:11.443
Would you like to go to Osaka?

19:12.194 --> 19:13.821
Break into a souls warehouse?

19:15.739 --> 19:16.824
Security tight?

19:16.907 --> 19:19.868
No, no, it's not really heavily
defended at all.

19:19.952 --> 19:22.287
Shut up. Security's tight.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.497
Well, what about you?

19:23.580 --> 19:25.374
I got a date with this asshole.

19:25.457 --> 19:26.834
Where's Osaka again?

19:26.917 --> 19:28.085
Japan, you idiot.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.799
And that's a sucker punch.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.468
Yeah, okay, I'll go.

19:36.552 --> 19:37.886
You both will.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.898
You know every
speck of dust in your house

19:49.982 --> 19:51.567
is like a microhistory of your life?

19:51.900 --> 19:54.486
There's 63,000 different kinds of fungi.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.907
You know, there's 16,000
different species of bacteria.

19:58.991 --> 20:01.076
- And there are spores...
- I...

20:02.035 --> 20:05.455
I don't care about that right now.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.292
Right.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.627
Right.

20:30.689 --> 20:31.899
Do you trust me?

20:32.399 --> 20:33.400
I do.

20:34.276 --> 20:37.279
- Do you choose this freely?
- I do.

20:37.362 --> 20:41.825
Do you forsake the sunlit world
and surrender...

20:41.909 --> 20:42.910
What is it?

20:42.993 --> 20:45.787
"To our dark and scarlet urging."

20:45.871 --> 20:48.790
Sorry. Our dark and scarlet urging?

20:49.082 --> 20:50.083
I will.

20:55.881 --> 20:57.299
You know, you don't have to do this.

20:58.467 --> 20:59.843
I want to.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.013
Don't you?

21:06.850 --> 21:07.851
Okay.

21:26.161 --> 21:28.121
That's enough, brother.

22:04.616 --> 22:07.369
Tomorrow, my child, you fly.

22:27.848 --> 22:29.808
It's okay if it feels good.

22:34.813 --> 22:36.231
Do you wanna get out of here?

22:37.816 --> 22:39.443
Huh?

22:39.526 --> 22:41.778
Your target? Soul Happy Go Go.

22:41.862 --> 22:45.198
Located here, in Umeda,
the business district.

22:45.282 --> 22:49.161
There's a sublime sushi omakase
at the Imperial Hotel.

22:49.244 --> 22:53.123
Doubt you'll have time,
but if you do, keep your receipts.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.210
Normally, of course,
I'd send for the souls via FedEx,

22:57.294 --> 23:00.464
but the Allfather would catch wind
and start asking, "Why?"

23:00.547 --> 23:04.968
And right now, I'm two buttocks away
from being rolled into human paste.

23:05.052 --> 23:06.303
Cover story, sir?

23:06.970 --> 23:09.056
You are Veruca Weiss,

23:09.139 --> 23:11.475
a mid-level operative in Grail HR.

23:11.725 --> 23:14.144
- Will I have a limp, sir?
- You and your limps.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.147
What you need is
a cover story for that nose.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.232
Way ahead of you, sir. Phosphorus fire.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.485
I've decided Veruca's
an amateur chemist.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.904
She wanted to follow in
the footsteps of her father,

23:23.987 --> 23:25.989
a brilliant professor at Caltech,

23:26.073 --> 23:27.783
but when her mother
passed away in an unfortunate...

23:27.866 --> 23:29.159
Fine.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.371
You're Janie Finch, also in HR.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.123
No, no, no. I'm...

23:35.540 --> 23:37.542
No, I'm Marnie Pomerantz. I mean...

23:37.626 --> 23:39.169
That's always her cover.

23:39.669 --> 23:40.796
You gotta let her be Marnie.

23:40.879 --> 23:43.006
What's she like? Marnie.

23:44.216 --> 23:45.467
She's tough.

23:48.512 --> 23:50.097
She fights hard, obviously.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.644
Chews gum, whatever.

23:56.561 --> 23:57.896
Chews gum? Ha.

23:59.064 --> 24:00.899
Interesting character. Very complex.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.067
Oh, I'll show you complex.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.652
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Yeah, it does.

24:03.735 --> 24:09.116
You are Grail operative Janie Finch,
and so you will be wearing this.

24:12.327 --> 24:13.703
Can I talk to you a sec?

24:18.458 --> 24:19.459
Hey.

24:21.545 --> 24:22.629
This is how we do it.

24:23.213 --> 24:24.631
This is how we win.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.217
You go with Featherstone,
I go with Starr.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.677
This is so dumb, Jesse.

24:29.261 --> 24:31.721
Pairing up with the world's
biggest backstabbing double-crossers.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.807
- You serious?
- Yeah, well, we're all out of options.

24:35.350 --> 24:38.061
Chances are,
one of us is gonna make it back here.

24:38.145 --> 24:40.856
If it's me with Genesis,
I'll kill Gran'ma.

24:40.939 --> 24:44.776
If it's you with the souls,
then you pay her off and you run.

24:44.901 --> 24:48.280
She is gonna push me, okay?
If I get on a plane with her...

24:48.363 --> 24:51.283
- Well, don't let her.
- She's gonna push me and push me,

24:52.075 --> 24:54.786
and I'm gonna pull some
stupid O'Hare shit like always.

24:54.870 --> 24:57.247
Oh, enough with the
"curse of the O'Hare" crap.

24:57.330 --> 24:58.540
Oh, right, like you've never thought it.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.083
I haven't.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.752
- Bullshit. You have.
- Well, if I have, I was wrong to.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.132
You're the toughest,

25:08.675 --> 25:11.344
most surviving-est woman I ever met.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.264
"Surviving-est"?

25:14.347 --> 25:15.557
Mmm-hmm.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.977
Mmm. I like that.

25:22.939 --> 25:24.816
If Flufferman gets up in your grill,

25:26.109 --> 25:27.694
just close your eyes and...

25:28.778 --> 25:30.697
Breathe.

25:32.616 --> 25:34.618
- Breathe?
- Yeah, and you'll be fine.

25:35.911 --> 25:37.829
I am not wearing that suit.

26:32.842 --> 26:33.843
All right.

26:51.903 --> 26:53.822
Hey, check this out. I...

26:54.322 --> 26:55.448
Stop doing that!

26:55.532 --> 26:57.033
Sorry. You know, I'm just...

26:57.367 --> 26:58.827
Giving a little helping hand.

27:11.089 --> 27:13.174
You'd think I'd have
a tail at least. You know?

27:13.591 --> 27:16.469
Give it time, brother.
You've only just started.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.888
Give it time?
It's been, like, three hours.

27:19.306 --> 27:20.432
Maybe more than that.

27:21.349 --> 27:22.809
Have you ever had cat sex?

27:23.810 --> 27:24.894
Oh! I can do this.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.397
I want to be able
to lick my own feet.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.524
That him? Man with the cat?

27:29.941 --> 27:32.235
Yeah. We need him alive.

27:33.028 --> 27:34.029
And the cat-man?

27:35.572 --> 27:36.865
Do whatever you want with him.

27:39.993 --> 27:40.994
Saddle up.

28:02.265 --> 28:03.600
I don't wanna talk about it.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.604
Not one goddamn word.

28:07.687 --> 28:08.688
Okay.

28:11.316 --> 28:13.109
Some sort of polyester blend?

28:13.193 --> 28:15.320
- What did I just say?
- All right, I'm sorry.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.249
You ever been to Japan?

28:28.333 --> 28:33.129
Nope. Never even tried sushi.

28:33.213 --> 28:34.297
Hmm.

28:37.384 --> 28:38.676
You going back to New Orleans?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.261
First thing in the morning.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.263
Check on Cass while you're there.

28:43.473 --> 28:44.641
I may not get a chance.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.351
Check on him, Jesse.

28:47.936 --> 28:50.772
He's your best friend,
and I'm worried about him.

28:51.648 --> 28:54.609
I would love to go myself,

28:54.692 --> 28:57.529
but I'm not allowed
on airplanes anymore,

28:57.612 --> 28:59.864
since they tightened up the watch list.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.367
Oh. Too bad.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.786
But Jody will take
good care of you.

29:06.496 --> 29:07.497
Time to go.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.137
Watch your ass, okay?

29:24.097 --> 29:26.349
- You watch yours, too.
- Mmm-hmm.

29:29.644 --> 29:31.104
You watch your ass, too...

29:32.355 --> 29:33.356
Sir.

29:36.401 --> 29:38.736
I'll call you from the car.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.196
Why?

29:41.364 --> 29:43.783
Yeah, I'll text you from the plane.

29:43.867 --> 29:44.951
Why?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.412
I'll see you when
the mission's done, sir.

29:51.583 --> 29:54.085
Excellent. The game's afoot.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.504
Jesse.

30:00.175 --> 30:01.426
Give me a minute.

30:10.768 --> 30:12.270
I like your hat.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.610
Thank you.

30:18.693 --> 30:21.237
Yeah, I had a hat once.

30:25.909 --> 30:29.996
It was, uh, made out of possum guts.

30:31.039 --> 30:35.543
You know possum guts? It was...
It stank to high heaven

30:35.627 --> 30:39.214
'cause I didn't cure the flesh,
I didn't cure it right.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.090
But the thing
I loved most about...

30:41.174 --> 30:43.092
Excuse me.

30:46.095 --> 30:49.265
Oh, yeah. You go right ahead.

31:02.237 --> 31:03.571
So, you're leaving?

31:05.031 --> 31:06.241
Mmm-hmm.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.286
No, you're not.
No, you're gonna stay here with me.

31:10.870 --> 31:14.457
Because T.C. is making
chicken biscuits for supper, and you,

31:14.541 --> 31:17.502
you love chicken biscuits.
So that's it, then, you're gonna stay.

31:18.586 --> 31:22.340
Gran'ma, this is a good thing.

31:25.635 --> 31:27.762
Gonna finally get what you want.

31:29.138 --> 31:30.640
What you've always wanted.

31:31.599 --> 31:32.767
I hope so.

31:37.438 --> 31:40.692
Otherwise, I'll tear you in half,
suck out your soul

31:40.775 --> 31:43.194
and send you to Hell
the way I did your mama.

31:44.612 --> 31:46.573
It won't come to that.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.662
Trust me.

31:58.209 --> 31:59.586
You'll come back to me?

32:01.129 --> 32:02.463
I'll come back.

32:02.547 --> 32:04.299
Okay.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.092
I promise.

32:24.611 --> 32:27.739
The flying's coming along.
The animal transmutation?

32:27.822 --> 32:31.743
A work in progress.
But the mesmerizing...

32:31.826 --> 32:32.910
All right.

32:33.661 --> 32:34.954
That was embarrassing, mate.

32:35.038 --> 32:37.123
I'll tell you what,
you're making fun of me?

32:37.206 --> 32:39.751
You, a man who's off his face off
one glass of bloody absinthe?

32:39.959 --> 32:41.336
Uh, it was a glass and a half, actually.

32:44.589 --> 32:46.799
I always cursed
the day I was turned, you know?

32:47.508 --> 32:48.843
Just being what I was, like.

32:50.053 --> 32:52.555
Maybe you're right, maybe
I've just been doing it all wrong?

32:52.764 --> 32:54.474
Well, perhaps I have as well.

32:54.682 --> 32:57.018
Been on this planet for over 300 years,

32:57.101 --> 32:59.937
and I'd never done
a bong hit until tonight.

33:00.021 --> 33:01.147
That's pitiful.

33:01.230 --> 33:03.316
There are other ways
to make up for lost time, though.

33:03.399 --> 33:06.361
You know, I teach an absolute
bloody masterclass in angel dust.

33:07.362 --> 33:10.406
Well, that's because you're
a junkie nonpareil, Cassidy.

33:11.532 --> 33:13.159
You calling me a junkie?

33:13.242 --> 33:17.580
A wanton, riotous junkie.

33:18.790 --> 33:19.999
And I love it.

33:24.337 --> 33:25.630
Hey, so here's an idea.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.882
I heard about this underground
sex club down the road down there.

33:28.549 --> 33:29.550
Ow.

33:32.428 --> 33:33.805
Cassidy!

33:39.936 --> 33:41.312
Squeeze him!

33:57.203 --> 33:58.329
Abomination.

33:58.413 --> 34:01.833
I've built up quite the tolerance
to tranquilizers over the years.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.460
How's yours?

34:22.311 --> 34:23.312
Oh, shit.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.170
Why so glum, chum?

34:54.010 --> 34:56.387
No. A mouse?

34:58.014 --> 34:59.849
Jesus Christ,
I didn't know you could do that.

35:00.266 --> 35:03.770
Given enough time,
we can do anything.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.738
This is all my fault.

35:15.698 --> 35:16.991
No.

35:17.492 --> 35:18.659
No.

35:19.702 --> 35:21.829
There will always be those
that want to hunt us.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.874
These aren't your average
vampire vigilantes.

35:25.625 --> 35:26.918
Look, my friends...

35:28.711 --> 35:31.088
These people,
I got mixed up with them and...

35:33.591 --> 35:35.426
I'm sorry, I have to go.

35:35.635 --> 35:37.261
No, you don't.

35:37.887 --> 35:41.182
Look, you don't understand.
They're a worldwide death cult.

35:41.265 --> 35:43.726
And now, for whatever reason,
they're coming after me.

35:44.352 --> 35:47.313
No. Cassidy...

35:52.109 --> 35:53.778
They won't just be coming after you.

35:56.113 --> 35:57.406
They'll be coming after us.

36:14.632 --> 36:16.801
<i>Thank you f
or flying Intercontinental Airways.</i>

36:16.884 --> 36:18.427
<i>Please enjoy your flight.</i>

36:30.648 --> 36:32.024
That's mine.

36:32.108 --> 36:33.401
You're not reading it.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.447
Well, I was gonna.

36:38.531 --> 36:39.615
Relax, Janie.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.451
You can look at the pictures
when I'm done.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.091
Back it up, O'Hare.

36:58.551 --> 37:02.680
<i>We have now reached
our cruising altitude of 35,000 feet.</i>

37:02.763 --> 37:06.559
<i>Sit back, relax
and enjoy your 16-hour flight.</i>

37:18.654 --> 37:21.032
How many people
have you driven to the airport?

37:21.365 --> 37:23.075
Oh, hundreds.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.247
Thank you, Eccarius.

37:29.123 --> 37:31.417
For letting me be your emissary.

37:38.883 --> 37:41.802
Should probably get going.

37:42.845 --> 37:44.513
Don't wanna miss the plane.

37:47.350 --> 37:48.517
There is no plane.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.855
There's never been a plane.

37:57.234 --> 37:59.195
What do you mean? Eccarius?

37:59.654 --> 38:02.740
Why would I send another
vampire into the world?

38:05.534 --> 38:07.370
A filthy piece of vermin,

38:09.121 --> 38:12.041
spoiling, stinking

38:13.292 --> 38:14.710
falling into despair.

38:16.337 --> 38:17.672
But...

38:19.006 --> 38:20.716
You're a vampire, too.

38:24.011 --> 38:25.304
Yes.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.228
And I'm the worst one of all.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.414
We are gonna get my soul?

39:33.497 --> 39:34.498
Correct.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.461
And that will make Genesis work?

39:38.836 --> 39:39.837
Yes.

39:40.588 --> 39:42.339
Then I will be your Messiah?

39:42.423 --> 39:43.716
Exactly.

39:48.888 --> 39:52.099
What if I make Genesis work
and I don't wanna be your Messiah?

39:52.183 --> 39:54.560
This is not the time for plots
and subterfuge.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.437
There's too much at stake.

39:57.897 --> 39:59.857
You're going to have to trust me.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.942
You and your industry-standard lies?

40:03.360 --> 40:08.532
Custer, when you make a promise,

40:09.366 --> 40:11.410
it means something to you, yes?

40:11.494 --> 40:12.787
That's right.

40:12.870 --> 40:18.000
Well, I want you to promise
that when Genesis starts working,

40:18.667 --> 40:20.169
you won't betray me,

40:21.337 --> 40:24.548
kill me or force me
to have sex with you.

40:25.549 --> 40:26.842
Promise me that

40:29.011 --> 40:31.222
and I promise I will
take you to your soul.

40:34.725 --> 40:36.018
Then I promise.

40:38.104 --> 40:40.064
- Again?
- Again.

40:57.915 --> 40:58.916
<i>Herr</i> Starr.

41:04.922 --> 41:06.132
Speak.

41:06.215 --> 41:08.467
<i>I lost him, sir. The vampire.</i>

41:08.592 --> 41:12.304
<i>I had sun lamps and Catholics,
but I let you down.</i>

41:12.388 --> 41:14.223
I will let you down, Hoover,

41:14.306 --> 41:18.269
into a vat of acid if you fail
this mission. Understand?

41:18.352 --> 41:22.523
<i>Yes, sir. I've got a few
other ideas up my sleeve, so...</i>

41:42.668 --> 41:44.712
This new color is pretty.

41:45.713 --> 41:47.006
I like the sparkles.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.134
You smudged the pinky toe.

41:50.217 --> 41:51.218
No, I didn't smudge.

41:53.721 --> 41:55.514
Diddle-dee-doo.

41:55.598 --> 41:56.974
This little piggy...

41:58.225 --> 42:00.019
- Miss Marie?
- What?

42:00.102 --> 42:02.605
Well, I wanted to...

42:04.106 --> 42:05.399
What's a "Genesis"?

42:05.482 --> 42:07.651
It's the first book of the Bible.

42:09.862 --> 42:13.199
Dear Christ, you're simpler
than a box of empty baskets.

42:13.282 --> 42:14.783
No, no, I know that.

42:15.826 --> 42:17.328
I know all the Bible books.

42:18.329 --> 42:20.164
What's "a Genesis"?

42:25.920 --> 42:27.755
Theodore Charles,

42:27.838 --> 42:30.716
where in the world
did you ever hear about that?

43:27.231 --> 43:28.274
Your offices?

43:28.857 --> 43:31.026
We relocated, but yes.

43:31.986 --> 43:33.028
My soul is here?

43:33.112 --> 43:36.115
In the reception area as we speak,
waiting for your arrival.

43:37.449 --> 43:38.617
I just want you to know,

43:38.701 --> 43:41.287
no matter what happens from here on out,

43:41.370 --> 43:42.997
I'm with you, Messiah.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.123
Yeah, right.

43:45.624 --> 43:48.294
But if you want your soul,

43:48.377 --> 43:50.671
if we're going to make this work,

43:50.754 --> 43:53.132
you are going to have to kill him.

43:54.591 --> 43:55.676
Who?

43:58.804 --> 44:01.015
Jesse Custer, as requested, sir.

44:01.974 --> 44:04.560
Thrice blessed, O Custer.
