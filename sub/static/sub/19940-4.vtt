03:12.710 --> 03:14.710
Well, what am I supposed
to do with the dishes?

03:14.750 --> 03:17.420
- Linen closet. -Dishes
in the linen closet, please.

03:17.460 --> 03:20.090
- Yes, ma'am.
- MAN: Well, hold on a second.

03:20.130 --> 03:22.340
Ethan, what are you watching?

03:22.390 --> 03:24.220
Grandma says it's good.

03:24.260 --> 03:26.260
It's Liberace. It's magic.

03:26.310 --> 03:28.100
And he's single.

03:28.140 --> 03:30.100
- Not my type, Mama.
- All right.

03:30.140 --> 03:32.150
I put the other end table
in the kids' room.

03:32.190 --> 03:33.810
We should get rid of this stuff.

03:33.860 --> 03:35.980
- Nonsense. We'll make it fit.
- I should sell it.

03:36.020 --> 03:37.456
- You'll need it.
- Well, the super's

03:37.480 --> 03:39.490

in the basement forever.

03:39.530 --> 03:41.990
He will if he doesn't want
his wife to find out

03:42.030 --> 03:44.660
there's nothing wrong with
Dottie Milford's pipes in 4D.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.660
These can go

03:46.700 --> 03:49.200
- ABE: What? What's going
in my closet? -Nothing!

03:49.250 --> 03:51.040
ABE:
This door won't move!

03:51.080 --> 03:52.920
There are things
in front of it. Why?

03:52.960 --> 03:54.830
Am I supposed to live
in here now?

03:54.880 --> 03:56.266
Was that grapefruit
the last breakfast

03:56.290 --> 03:58.300
- I'm ever going to eat?
- Move these, please.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.510
- Why are they moving that?
- Your father's blocked in.

04:00.550 --> 04:02.510
- He is?
- ABE: Yes! He is!

04:02.550 --> 04:04.220
Abe, please relax.

04:04.260 --> 04:06.470
Well, you said this wasn't going
to be an inconvenience.

04:06.510 --> 04:08.060
I consider not being able

04:08.100 --> 04:09.826
to leave my study
somewhat of an inconvenience.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.690
These can go
in the kids' room for now.

04:11.730 --> 04:13.496
- Yes, ma'am. -Keep putting
things in the kids' room,

04:13.520 --> 04:15.036
we won't have anywhere
to put the kids.

04:15.060 --> 04:16.480
Abe, your door is clear!

04:16.519 --> 04:18.320
What's that?

04:18.360 --> 04:20.610
- It's a box of Joel's things.
- I'll take it.

04:20.649 --> 04:22.610
Abe? The boxes have been moved.

04:22.650 --> 04:25.120
- You'll take it where?
- I'll put it in the basement.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.160
Abe! I thought
you wanted to come out.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.330
No. I wanted the option
of coming out.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.620
I'll take care of it.
I should get these to him.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.330
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.710
Go look in your room...
there's a lovely little surprise

04:35.750 --> 04:37.840

- Well, no.

06:42.710 --> 06:44.380
What-what do I seem like?

06:44.420 --> 06:45.710
I don't know. A Doug?

conversation is going so far?

06:51.050 --> 06:52.220

Uh, what time
are we meeting up today?

06:53.600 --> 06:54.616
I can't do today... the movers

06:54.640 --> 06:55.850
have been here since 6:00.

06:55.890 --> 06:57.116
And my parents' apartment's

- Yep. Sure.

07:01.190 --> 07:03.860

of Joel's things, and...

07:03.900 --> 07:05.280
Can I get a candy bar?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.256
- Sure. What kind? -(Midge
continues speaking over phone)

07:07.280 --> 07:09.990
I can't decide between
the Zagnut and the Hershey bar.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.160
Well, personally,
I like the Zagnut. It's filling.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.410
Plus, I had a cousin
who lived on a farm,

07:14.450 --> 07:16.200
used to feed Hershey bars
to the sheep

07:16.240 --> 07:17.580
when they got constipated.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.160
Now, she was a weird broad,
but still,

07:19.210 --> 07:20.646
I could never separate
the two again.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.250
- I'll get the Zagnut.
- Okay.

MIDGE: ...what do I do
with these shoes?

07:23.920 --> 07:26.050
Do I throw them away?
Do I keep them for Ethan?

07:26.090 --> 07:27.686
Oh, I'm just babbling.
Now, how about tomorrow?

07:27.710 --> 07:29.050
Great. Tomorrow's great.

07:29.090 --> 07:30.510
- Around 3:00?
- I'll see you then.

07:31.430 --> 07:33.090
That's my client.

07:33.140 --> 07:35.140
Ah. See my card?

07:48.110 --> 07:51.820

07:51.860 --> 07:53.620
Did I do it yet?

07:53.660 --> 07:55.240
ROSE:
Forget about the dishes.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.120
Zelda will be here

07:57.160 --> 07:59.120
I can't move.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.040
- I can't think.
- Don't move. Don't think.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.830
Just drink.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.090
- You made your cocoa.
- My Parisian cocoa.

08:06.130 --> 08:08.460
Oh, you haven't made this
since I left for college.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.760
- Well, you're home now.
I thought we'd celebrate. -Mmm!

08:11.800 --> 08:14.050

Okay.

08:14.090 --> 08:16.640

08:16.680 --> 08:18.310
Excuse me, Ethan.

08:18.350 --> 08:20.350
It is now after dinner.

08:20.390 --> 08:22.890
After dinner is my time to read.

08:22.940 --> 08:25.020
(dummy shouting on TV)

08:25.060 --> 08:26.440
Therefore...

08:26.480 --> 08:28.480
I need the room.

08:30.280 --> 08:33.200
Miriam, does your son not
understand the word "therefore"?

08:33.240 --> 08:35.200
I feel like that's
where I lost him.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.570
Do you need something, Papa?

08:36.620 --> 08:38.740
Yes. Please explain to your son
that I need the room.

08:38.789 --> 08:41.330
- Why?
- Because it's after dinner,

08:41.370 --> 08:43.120
and after dinner...

08:43.159 --> 08:45.540
Rose, please explain to your
daughter that I need the room.

08:45.580 --> 08:47.790
- You can still read.
- The television is on.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.840
- He'll turn it down. -I need
silence. Complete silence.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.720
Abe, perhaps just for tonight.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.720
No, no "Abe,
perhaps just for tonight."

08:54.760 --> 08:57.510
This is how I live my life,
you both know this.

08:57.550 --> 09:00.390
- He's a little boy. -I know
that, which is why I win.

09:00.430 --> 09:02.520
- You can go in your study,
can't you? -(chuckles)

09:02.560 --> 09:03.940
I'm not falling for that again.

09:03.980 --> 09:06.230
- Please, Papa?
- Nope. I'm turning it off.

09:06.270 --> 09:08.110
No, no, no,
Papa, Papa, please don't!

09:08.150 --> 09:10.086
Have you ever been around Ethan
when he can't watch Howdy Doody?

09:10.110 --> 09:11.530
Because it's terrible.
Trust me.

09:11.570 --> 09:12.940
I'm saving you
from something here.

09:12.990 --> 09:16.700
I will not be held hostage
in my own home.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.370
- It's only temporary.
- How do you know?

09:18.410 --> 09:20.006
You don't know how long
you're gonna be here.

09:20.030 --> 09:21.790
It could be days, weeks, years.

09:21.830 --> 09:24.210
- It will not be years.
- And I will not spend years

09:24.250 --> 09:25.920
adjusting to your needs.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.290
See, you have to adjust to mine,

09:28.330 --> 09:31.170
to ours, to your mother's needs,
and mine.

09:31.210 --> 09:33.260
I don't mind
if he watches the show.

09:33.300 --> 09:34.970
Will you just stick
with me, please?

09:35.010 --> 09:36.630
I'm never taking you
into battle.

"I'll meet you later,
once our side has won."

09:38.890 --> 09:40.850

why don't we just get

09:40.890 --> 09:42.100
another television set?

09:42.140 --> 09:43.770
- We could put it
in Miriam's room. -Yes.

09:43.810 --> 09:45.576
- No. -A second television's
a wonderful idea.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.036
Ethan could go into my room to
watch his shows, and I can watch

09:48.060 --> 09:50.360
Jack Paar in there at night,
so you don't have to hear it.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.520
I don't like Jack Paar.

09:51.570 --> 09:52.836
There are jugglers on Jack Paar.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.530
- See? -We are not paying
for another TV

09:55.570 --> 09:57.910
just so that you can have
Jack Paar in your bedroom.

09:57.950 --> 10:00.830
We only have this one
in case of a national emergency.

10:00.870 --> 10:02.830
What about the TV
you had in your apartment?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.596
It's in the basement.
I could ask Mrs. Zuckerman

10:04.620 --> 10:05.846
- to bring it up tomorrow.
- No.

10:05.870 --> 10:07.500
Yes! No. Thank you.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.186
That was Joel's TV.
I don't want Joel's TV in here.

10:09.210 --> 10:11.170
I don't want Joel's TV
in here, either.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.420

10:13.460 --> 10:15.130
That's it, I'm turning it off.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.520
Okay.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.600
Just for this evening.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.480

Goulash seems to be a dish

10:42.530 --> 10:44.490
I'll have Zelda add it
to the rotation

10:44.540 --> 10:46.160
now that the children are here.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.160
I want you to talk to Miriam.

10:48.210 --> 10:49.500
About what?

10:49.540 --> 10:51.750
Her son eats
with his mouth open.

10:51.790 --> 10:53.630
- It needs to stop.
- He's three.

10:53.670 --> 10:56.050
When I was three,
I could resole a shoe.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.880
I'm not sure
that's a direct comparison.

10:58.930 --> 11:01.680
Well... we're doomed.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.730
You know this has been
a very hard time for Miriam.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.860
So much upheaval so quickly.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.520
And you know her...

11:14.570 --> 11:16.730
she thought she had
the whole world figured out.

11:16.780 --> 11:19.150
(groans)
I could've told her she didn't.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.990
I want her to be happy here.

11:21.030 --> 11:24.240
I want it to be a nice stay
for her and the children.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.330
What's the harm
in getting a second TV?

11:26.370 --> 11:28.450
- No.
- We can afford it.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.710
And it would make everything
so much calmer.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.460
I am not a two-TV set
sort of man.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.550
Maybe other people have two TVs.

11:35.590 --> 11:37.510
Maybe Jack Paar has two TVs.

11:37.550 --> 11:39.300
But not me.

11:39.340 --> 11:40.840
End of discussion.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.260
Abe.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.680
I heard myself say,
"End of discussion,"

11:44.720 --> 11:47.520
and yet apparently it's not
the end of the discussion.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.520
Miriam needs calm right now.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.850
She needs a sense
of order and normalcy.

11:51.890 --> 11:56.480
I want her to be as happy
as possible while she waits.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.240
- Waits for what?
- For Joel to come back.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.650
- (groans): Oh, Rose. -Because
he's going to come back,

12:01.700 --> 12:03.910
it's just a matter of time,
and I want her

12:03.950 --> 12:06.700
as distracted and carefree
as possible,

12:06.740 --> 12:08.870
because it
will all be over soon.

12:08.910 --> 12:11.160
Rose, I...

12:12.210 --> 12:14.130

Oh, thank you, Abe.

collectors of sound.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.380
Whatever's not
in a mainstream store,

18:35.420 --> 18:36.760
they seek out and find.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.390
My God, political speeches,
concerts.

18:39.430 --> 18:42.890
"Mark Twain presenting at
Royal Albert Hall, 1904."

18:42.930 --> 18:44.366
Did they even have
recording devices then?

18:44.390 --> 18:45.720
This was an early application...

18:45.770 --> 18:47.270
a, uh, articulated
stylus incising...

18:47.310 --> 18:49.730
Bup-bup-bup. Nerd alert.
Come here.

18:49.770 --> 18:53.480
This is the section
I wanted to show you.

18:53.520 --> 18:56.940
Comedy recordings
dating back 50-plus years.

18:56.990 --> 18:59.070
Your Mort Sahls, your
Ernie Kovacs, they're great,

18:59.110 --> 19:00.506
but there is so much more
out there.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.830
- What are these?
- Oh, party records.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.806
They're a whole sub-genre.
It's not really your style,

19:04.830 --> 19:06.096
but you should know
who they are.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.040
- She should be wearing gloves.
- I know.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.210
- Redd Foxx. Never heard of him.
- Oh, you will.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.290
MIDGE:
I'm gonna get this.

19:11.330 --> 19:13.000
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, I'm going.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.960
How much?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.840
- That's not for sale.
- SUSIE: Virgil...

19:16.880 --> 19:18.130
It's my only copy.

19:18.170 --> 19:19.930
- Virgil...
- Buck-fifty.

19:22.550 --> 19:24.236
You know, I'm just realizing
how much I don't know

19:24.260 --> 19:25.760
about everything.

19:25.810 --> 19:27.520
I feel like I've been
living in a bubble,

19:27.560 --> 19:29.140
but I'm gonna catch up,
you'll see.

19:29.180 --> 19:31.076
In college, no one could study
better than I could.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.560
Research? No one was better
at research than me.

19:33.610 --> 19:35.270
I had fabulous binders.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.440
So, where do we start?

19:37.480 --> 19:38.990
Well, are you free
Tuesday night?

19:39.030 --> 19:40.376
I mean,
we could go see some comics.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.450
Tuesday night, comics.
It's a date.

19:42.490 --> 19:44.330
Thanks, boys.
I'll be back.

19:44.370 --> 19:45.620
Go rinse off.

19:51.170 --> 19:53.750
I think this one is perfect.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.130
It will just fit
on your dresser.

19:55.170 --> 19:57.170
Are you sure Papa's okay
with a second TV?

19:57.210 --> 19:59.010
- Yes.
- He seemed adamant.

19:59.050 --> 20:01.220
- Please, it's like the skates.
- What skates?

20:01.260 --> 20:03.276
- When you were ten, you wanted
skates. -(doorbell buzzes)

20:03.300 --> 20:05.010
Your father said no.
You threw such a fit,

20:05.050 --> 20:06.220
he sent you to your room.

20:06.260 --> 20:08.520
Two days later,
I got you skates.

20:08.560 --> 20:09.890
I got you this.
It's what I do.

20:09.930 --> 20:11.116
- I get you things.

20:11.140 --> 20:13.190
Rose.

20:13.230 --> 20:14.810
Hello. It's been forever.

20:14.860 --> 20:16.520
Well, hello, Loretta.

20:16.570 --> 20:18.440
How are you, Jerry?

20:18.480 --> 20:20.240
I'm good.
Thank you, Mrs. Maisel.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.950
Lobby, please.

20:24.410 --> 20:26.580
Miriam, you remember Loretta?

20:26.620 --> 20:28.040
Her mother lives
in the penthouse.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.000
Miriam, how trim you look.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.870
The last time I saw you,
you were enormous.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.460
- Well, I was pregnant.
- If I had a nickel.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.920
You look wonderful
yourself, Loretta.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.670
I had half my intestine out.

20:39.710 --> 20:41.220
So, Rose, catch me up.

20:41.260 --> 20:43.260
You played hooky
from canasta last week.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.260
Oh, well, we've been very busy.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.010
Joel... you remember Joel...

20:47.050 --> 20:49.560
he got a big promotion,
which is wonderful,

20:49.600 --> 20:52.140
except it keeps him
traveling constantly.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.400
But it's just
so much more money.

20:54.440 --> 20:55.940
He couldn't say no.

20:55.980 --> 20:58.070
So Miriam decided
to remodel their apartment,

20:58.110 --> 20:59.530
and that's been
going on for months.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.150
Their place is a shambles.

21:01.190 --> 21:02.836
Miriam and the children have
been living with us

21:02.860 --> 21:05.280
until Joel gets back
to throttle that contractor.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.200
I can't wait to see
the final product.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.426
We'll have a party... you'll be
the first one in the door.

21:09.450 --> 21:11.450
(elevator bell dings)

21:11.500 --> 21:13.710
Congratulations
on Joel's promotion.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.790
- You must be bursting.
- I am.

21:16.830 --> 21:18.460
Shall we?

21:21.050 --> 21:22.760
(laughter)

21:22.800 --> 21:25.180
REDD FOXX (on record): A guy
went to a private detective,

21:25.220 --> 21:27.180
he said, "Listen,
I want you to find me"

21:27.220 --> 21:29.720
a pretty girl with $500."

21:29.760 --> 21:32.060
The guy say, "I found you
a pretty girl yesterday."

21:32.100 --> 21:33.616
He said, "Well,
you better find her again",

21:33.640 --> 21:35.390
'cause she got my $500."

21:35.440 --> 21:37.730
(laughs)

21:41.900 --> 21:44.150
Two babies were talking once
in the hospital,

21:44.190 --> 21:46.216
and one asked the other, said,
"How you like to be fed,

21:46.240 --> 21:48.570
by the bottle
or by the other way?"

21:48.620 --> 21:50.870
(laughter on record)

21:50.910 --> 21:52.136
- (knocking on door)
- The baby say,

21:52.160 --> 21:53.580
"I'd rather be fed
by the bottle,

21:53.620 --> 21:56.250
because the other way I get
too many ashes in my eyes."

21:56.290 --> 21:58.170
- (record scratches)
- My God.

21:58.210 --> 21:59.766
I was banging on your door
like the grim reaper.

21:59.790 --> 22:00.790
Didn't you hear me?

22:00.840 --> 22:02.170
No, Mama.

22:02.210 --> 22:03.670
What are you listening to?

22:03.710 --> 22:04.800
Nothing, Mama.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.930
Well, dinner is ready.

22:06.970 --> 22:08.430
It's getting cold.
Lamb curry.

22:08.470 --> 22:09.970
I'll be out in a minute, Mama.

22:13.390 --> 22:15.230
(door closes)

22:15.270 --> 22:17.270
Oh...

22:17.310 --> 22:18.536
ROSE:
We can take the lamb curry

22:18.560 --> 22:20.190
off the children-approved meals.

22:20.230 --> 22:22.020
Zelda gave Ethan
a peanut butter sandwich

22:22.070 --> 22:23.480
and sent him to bed.

22:23.530 --> 22:25.780
He's a picky one,
that son of mine.

22:25.820 --> 22:27.700
I talked to Mr. Zuckerman.

22:27.740 --> 22:29.410
He's agreed to store
all of your furniture

22:29.450 --> 22:30.870
for the next two months.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.530
- So it worked.
- Of course it worked.

22:32.580 --> 22:33.910
- What worked?
- Nothing, Abe.

22:33.950 --> 22:35.370
It worked, nothing worked...

22:35.410 --> 22:36.370
ROSE:
Two months is

22:36.410 --> 22:37.790
a good amount of time.

22:37.830 --> 22:39.436
Things should definitely
sort themselves out

22:39.460 --> 22:40.580
in two months.

22:40.630 --> 22:42.170
You know, I read in the paper

22:42.210 --> 22:43.816
that Senator Kennedy is gonna
run for president.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.010
ABE:
That pretty boy?

22:45.050 --> 22:46.170
Just because he's attractive

22:46.220 --> 22:47.356
doesn't mean he's unqualified.

22:47.380 --> 22:48.760
Of course it does.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.970
To be truly effective,
you must be ugly.

22:51.010 --> 22:52.276
- That's ridiculous.
- (phone rings)

22:52.300 --> 22:53.560
I'll get it.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.770
Look at all the great
thinkers of our time.

22:55.810 --> 22:57.640
- The great men.
- The great women.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.076
- Especially the women.
- ROSE: Hello?

22:59.100 --> 23:00.626
- They are all, to a tee...
- ROSE: Hello?

23:00.650 --> 23:03.190
...extremely unpleasant
to look at.

23:03.230 --> 23:05.110
I think Senator Kennedy's
brilliant.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.070
Of course you do.
And when did you start

23:07.110 --> 23:08.716
- to read the paper?
- ROSE: They hung up.

23:08.740 --> 23:11.780
- I read the paper.
- Yeah, only the shoe ads.

23:11.820 --> 23:13.160
You don't like Kennedy

23:13.200 --> 23:14.466
- because he's wealthy.
- Shady money.

23:14.490 --> 23:16.450
So you hate him
because of his father.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.290
His father is a terrible man.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.540
An anti-Semite,
an isolationist.

23:20.580 --> 23:22.960
- (phone rings)
- I'll get it.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.340
Why are you doing this?

23:26.380 --> 23:27.510
- ABE: Hello?
- Doing what?

23:27.550 --> 23:28.760
You're baiting your father.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.090
- I'm not.
- ABE: Hello?

23:30.130 --> 23:31.550
He shares his opinion,
I share mine.

23:31.590 --> 23:33.640
Well, don't do that.
Just let him win.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.930
- They hung up. (clears throat)
- ROSE: Oh.

23:36.970 --> 23:38.230
So, if you don't like Kennedy,

23:38.270 --> 23:39.536
who do you want
for president, Nixon?

23:39.560 --> 23:41.060
Oh, my God.

23:41.100 --> 23:43.690
When Richard Milhous Nixon
becomes president,

23:43.730 --> 23:44.820
we move to France.

23:44.860 --> 23:46.110
I would love to move to France.

23:46.150 --> 23:47.650
We're not moving to France.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.400
- (phone rings)
- I'll get it.

23:53.740 --> 23:55.120
Hello, Joel.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.556
JOEL: Wasn't sure you'd
remember our system.

23:56.580 --> 23:57.950
I remember it.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.516
It's been a while
since we were dating.

23:59.540 --> 24:01.210
I came up with the system.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.670
- So, you called?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.340
I just, uh,
thought you should know

24:05.380 --> 24:08.170
that I got a place,
an apartment.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.840
Figured it was time to
get out of Archie and Imogene's.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.300
I'm sure it was.

24:12.340 --> 24:14.430
JOEL: So, uh, now that
I have my own place,

24:14.470 --> 24:16.350
I... I'd like to see Ethan
a little more,

24:16.390 --> 24:17.430
if that's all right.

24:17.470 --> 24:20.850
Oh, uh, well,

24:20.890 --> 24:23.270
tell me about
this new place of yours.

24:23.310 --> 24:24.980
JOEL:
Nothing much to tell. (chuckles)

24:25.020 --> 24:26.980
Is it appropriate for Ethan?

24:27.020 --> 24:29.740
It's not one of those
downtown, fifth floor walk-ups

24:29.780 --> 24:31.796
with no hot water and
a bathtub in the kitchen, is it?

24:31.820 --> 24:34.660
No, no. Bathtub's down the hall.
(chuckles)

24:34.700 --> 24:37.030
- Ha ha.
- No, it-it's not a palace,

24:37.080 --> 24:40.540
but, uh, it's clean,
it's got an elevator,

24:40.580 --> 24:42.710
and, uh, there's a bed for him

24:42.750 --> 24:45.630
if he wants to nap
or stay over.

24:45.670 --> 24:48.340
- Well, that sounds fine.
- So, maybe tomorrow?

24:48.380 --> 24:50.300
You could drop him
by the office.

24:50.340 --> 24:52.220
He always likes emptying
the staplers.

24:52.260 --> 24:54.050
Drives everyone crazy
the next day, but...

24:54.090 --> 24:56.140
I have no interest in
stopping by your office.

24:56.180 --> 24:59.390
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

24:59.430 --> 25:03.190
Um, well, I-I could come
pick him up, then.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.100
I'll just swing by
your place around 5:00?

25:05.150 --> 25:06.440
5:00 is fine.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.270
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:08.320 --> 25:11.070
So... how are you?

to build a road. Where?

26:38.240 --> 26:40.070
Here. Right through
the middle of the park.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.280
This park?
This beautiful park?

26:42.330 --> 26:44.540
Oh, I don't believe that.
You must have read this wrong.

26:44.580 --> 26:49.460
All of you who came out today
and marched and made signs,

26:49.500 --> 26:52.460
you have made your voices heard.

26:52.500 --> 26:56.130
So, today, it should be
your voice speaking.

26:56.170 --> 26:58.010
(cheers and applause)

26:58.050 --> 26:59.800
You read this right. Wow.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.640
JACOBS:
It's your park, it's your city.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.140
You should tell your stories.

27:04.180 --> 27:07.810
Anyone who wishes to speak,
come up and speak.

27:07.850 --> 27:11.610
Just do it loud enough
that Robert Moses can hear you

27:11.650 --> 27:14.820
over his bulldozers.

27:14.860 --> 27:15.820
- Yes!
- (crowd cheering)

27:15.860 --> 27:17.150
Who is Robert Moses?

27:17.190 --> 27:19.150
The road is his idea.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.410
What a son of a bitch.

27:21.450 --> 27:23.660
You there... you seem
to have a lot to say.

27:23.700 --> 27:26.290
Who, me?
Oh, no, I-I just got this,

27:26.330 --> 27:29.080
and it-it's just terrible.
Somebody should do something.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.620
- We are.
- (crowd laughs)

27:30.670 --> 27:32.330
Yes, you are. I see.

27:32.380 --> 27:34.420
Uh, this is
a very impressive gathering.

27:34.460 --> 27:37.590
Why don't you come up
and share your story?

27:37.630 --> 27:39.130
Me? Oh, uh, well...

27:39.170 --> 27:40.470
Come on up.

27:40.510 --> 27:42.840
Share your story.

27:42.890 --> 27:44.890
(crowd cheering)

27:50.020 --> 27:53.230
Hello.
My name is Miriam Maisel.

27:53.270 --> 27:55.070
Oh, uh, "Midge" is fine,
actually.

27:55.110 --> 27:58.190
So... I don't live
anywhere near here.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.660
And I have absolutely no idea
what's going on, at all.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.596
I mean, five minutes ago,
I was buying records for my son,

28:03.620 --> 28:05.176
and he wanted to walk
through the park and then

28:05.200 --> 28:06.806
I stumbled upon this rally
and I was like,

28:06.830 --> 28:09.960
"So many women in one place...
two-for-one pantyhose?"

28:10.000 --> 28:12.580
And then I heard about you...

28:12.620 --> 28:14.630
and you...

28:14.670 --> 28:17.710
and-and this so-called
Robert Moses?

28:17.750 --> 28:19.026
Well, I mean,
he's not "so-called,"

28:19.050 --> 28:20.670
but he sounds terrible.
And I'm...

28:20.720 --> 28:23.550
I-I'm kicking myself
for being so out of the loop.

28:23.590 --> 28:25.826
I'm trying to read more papers
lately. It's interesting...

28:25.850 --> 28:27.786
my father pointed out that my
favorite part about a newspaper

28:27.810 --> 28:29.220
is the ads for shoes.

28:29.270 --> 28:32.100
And I felt bad about that,
but now I think

28:32.140 --> 28:35.860
maybe they just put those ads
in newspapers to distract us.

28:35.900 --> 28:38.070
- ALL: Yeah!
- Because if women don't realize

28:38.110 --> 28:41.990
what's going on in the world,
they won't step in and fix it.

28:42.030 --> 28:43.660
Oh, that's good.
Write that down.

28:43.700 --> 28:46.120
Because they will fix it.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.700
(crowd cheering)

28:47.740 --> 28:51.250
- And accessorize it!
- (cheering grows louder)

28:51.290 --> 28:52.596
MRS. MOSKOWITZ (over phone):
Joel Maisel's office.

28:52.620 --> 28:53.920
Hello?

28:53.960 --> 28:56.040
Yes, this is
Joel Maisel's office.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.130
Who is this?

28:57.170 --> 28:58.420
This is Mrs. Moskowitz.

28:58.460 --> 28:59.630
Who is this?

28:59.670 --> 29:01.210
I'm Mrs. Maisel.

29:01.260 --> 29:03.260
(chuckling):
Oh. Any relation?

29:03.300 --> 29:06.850
Uh, yes. Listen, I-I'm supposed
to meet Mr. Maisel tonight.

29:06.890 --> 29:08.430
He's taking his son
for the evening,

29:08.470 --> 29:10.156
but I got hung up,
and I'm not gonna be able

29:10.180 --> 29:11.930
to make it uptown in time
to meet him.

29:11.980 --> 29:14.310
- "Mrs. Maisel"?
- And since I'm already downtown,

29:14.350 --> 29:16.496
I thought maybe I could just
drop Ethan by Joel's new place,

29:16.520 --> 29:17.980
but I don't have
his new address.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.520
Oh, well, I can give you that.

29:19.570 --> 29:21.690
Let's see here.

29:21.740 --> 29:23.320
Uh, there it is.

29:23.360 --> 29:27.240
715 West 116th Street.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.740
- E-Excuse me?
- Is that wrong?

29:29.780 --> 29:31.750
Yes, it-it must be wrong.
I meant his new address,

29:31.790 --> 29:33.040
for his new apartment.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.000
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

29:35.040 --> 29:36.370
That's his new address.

29:36.420 --> 29:38.130
Oh.

29:38.170 --> 29:41.340
I-I just assumed...
he-he didn't move downtown?

29:41.380 --> 29:43.840
Is 116th Street downtown?

29:43.880 --> 29:45.050
- No.
- Oh.

29:45.090 --> 29:47.430
Well, I live in Queens so...

29:47.470 --> 29:48.736
All right. Thank... well,
thank you for your help.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.310
Mrs. Maisel!

29:50.350 --> 29:51.850
You're his wife...

30:11.910 --> 30:13.950
Can I help you?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.710
Uh, Joel Maisel?

30:16.750 --> 30:18.750
DOORMAN:
3C.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.760
(elevator bell dings)

30:25.800 --> 30:27.800
- Evening.
- 3C.

30:32.850 --> 30:34.020
(elevator bell dings)

30:34.060 --> 30:36.060
Third floor.

30:55.660 --> 30:57.660
- (door locks)
- PENNY: Joel! Joel!

30:57.710 --> 30:59.670
- JOEL: What?
- PENNY: Midge is here.

30:59.710 --> 31:01.130
(footsteps approaching)

31:03.170 --> 31:05.670
- What are you doing here?
- I'm dropping off your son.

31:05.710 --> 31:07.800
I went by the house to get him.
You weren't there.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.090
I know. I got held up.

31:09.130 --> 31:10.470
So, let's see the new digs.

31:17.270 --> 31:18.980
Huh.

31:19.020 --> 31:20.560
Interesting.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.360
- Hi-ya.
- I was worried.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.650
You should've called.

31:23.690 --> 31:25.360
Hey, pal.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.940
Hey, Daddy. We got records.

31:26.990 --> 31:28.700
JOEL: Well, that's great,
that's great.

31:28.740 --> 31:31.030
I did call.
I talked to your secretary.

31:31.070 --> 31:32.676
Better watch that one.
You know secretaries.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.780
Okay, so, I'm glad you're okay.

31:34.830 --> 31:37.870
- Thank you for dropping him off.
- You are welcome.

31:37.910 --> 31:40.790
Hey, ducks.

31:40.830 --> 31:43.130
So, your apartment.

31:43.170 --> 31:44.920
It's nice, it's really nice.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.550
- Thank you. -In fact, it looks
an awful lot like our place.

31:47.590 --> 31:49.050
- What?
- The building, the hallway,

31:49.090 --> 31:50.760
the old man in the elevator.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.116
- Midge. -And isn't that
the couch I wanted to buy,

31:52.140 --> 31:53.890
but you said was too deep?

31:53.930 --> 31:55.576
- I don't remember what couch
you... -You know, it's funny,

31:55.600 --> 31:57.180
I thought I'd find you squatting

31:57.220 --> 32:00.190
in some downtown,
smoke-filled atelier,

32:00.230 --> 32:04.310
not two blocks away, living the
Methodist version of our life.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.230
With the Methodist
version of me.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.690
Does she have an "on" switch?

32:08.740 --> 32:10.950
Ethan's good now,
you can go if you want.

32:10.990 --> 32:13.136
No, he was throwing up earlier.
I figure I should stay around

32:13.160 --> 32:14.960
a minute, make sure
he's not gonna blow again.

32:14.990 --> 32:16.580
- What?
- You know what's funny?

32:16.620 --> 32:18.330
I don't have
my apartment anymore.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.620
You have my apartment.

32:19.660 --> 32:21.500
You have a lot
of my things, actually.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.540
- You're welcome.
- (timer dings)

32:23.580 --> 32:24.960
- Dinner?
- Yes.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.500
- What?
- Pot roast.

32:26.540 --> 32:28.880
The Methodist version
of brisket.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.510
Can we discuss this
some other time? Please?

32:31.550 --> 32:34.430
Uh, where's he going?
Where's he going?

32:34.470 --> 32:35.760
JOEL:
Boy.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.390
Do you know
how to make an entrance.

32:37.430 --> 32:38.946
So is this
what you were missing, Joel?

32:38.970 --> 32:40.270
Pot roast and Santa Claus?

32:40.310 --> 32:41.706
I don't want
to talk about this here.

32:41.730 --> 32:43.190
Should we get lunch somewhere?

32:43.230 --> 32:45.110
Is there a mayonnaise
and Wonder Bread cafe

32:45.150 --> 32:46.480
opening up somewhere
we could try?

32:46.520 --> 32:48.230
I was gonna come pick him up.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.990
I was gonna come to you so that
you wouldn't have to come here.

32:51.030 --> 32:52.990
You are a prince, a real prince.

32:53.030 --> 32:54.950
I hope Penny knows
what a prince you are.

32:54.990 --> 32:56.200
I don't understand you, Midge.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.490
You don't understand me?

32:57.530 --> 32:58.660
Me? Me?

32:58.700 --> 32:59.870
I said I'd come back.

32:59.910 --> 33:01.410
- Remember?
- Oh, boy.

33:01.450 --> 33:03.580
I came to you
and I said let's try again.

33:03.620 --> 33:05.330
- You said no.
- Oh, no, uh-uh.

33:05.380 --> 33:06.580
You don't get to rewrite this.

33:06.630 --> 33:08.250
You're the one who left. Not me.

33:08.290 --> 33:10.090
I'm the good guy,
you're the bad guy.

33:10.130 --> 33:11.946
Stamp it, ship it,
that's all she wrote, folks.

33:11.970 --> 33:13.566
- Fine. -When are you coming
to get your things?

33:13.590 --> 33:15.316
- I don't know.
- You have things at my house

33:15.340 --> 33:17.326
- and I want them gone.
- You said you'd pack them up.

33:17.350 --> 33:19.536
I'm not packing up your things.
Penny can pack up your things.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.286
Or you can buy new things,
for your new life.

33:21.310 --> 33:23.060
- I'll come get them.
- Not when I'm home.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.270
Fine, I'll come get
my things when you're not home.

33:25.310 --> 33:26.810
- Because we're four.
- You're four.

33:26.860 --> 33:28.150
And I want my notebook.

33:28.190 --> 33:29.626
- What notebook?
- My comedy notebook.

33:29.650 --> 33:30.820
You mean my comedy notebook.

33:30.860 --> 33:32.240
It was about me.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.610
Everything's about you.

33:33.650 --> 33:34.820
I want it.

33:34.860 --> 33:36.030
Why? You quit, remember?

33:36.070 --> 33:37.490
I might try again.

33:37.530 --> 33:39.240
You don't know.
It's mine, I want it.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.490
Well, I-I don't know
where it is, but even if I did,

33:41.540 --> 33:43.250
as long as you have
Bob Newhart's album,

33:43.290 --> 33:44.460
you'll be fine.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.620
(scoffs)

33:45.670 --> 33:46.960
Low blow, Midge.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.056
You said you didn't want
our life.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.670
But this is our life.

33:49.710 --> 33:51.960
Y-You didn't go somewhere
exotic or different,

33:52.010 --> 33:53.760
you went across
the fucking street.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.510
- I had to.
- You had to?

33:55.550 --> 33:57.640
- Why? Tell me why.
- It doesn't even...

33:57.680 --> 33:58.850
Goddamn it, Joel, I'll do it.

33:58.890 --> 34:00.970
Because...

34:01.010 --> 34:03.730
after that night, at the club,
after I failed like that,

34:03.770 --> 34:06.480
I just knew you'd never
look at me the same again.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.480
You tell me I'm not right.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.480
Well, you're right.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.820
Just not about the club part.

34:14.690 --> 34:16.699
Sorry I got you
mixed up in this.

34:19.159 --> 34:22.540
Tell Ethan I'll pick him up
tomorrow.

34:22.580 --> 34:25.159
Don't baptize him
while I'm gone.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.250

35:11.880 --> 35:13.526
First stop of the night,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:13.550 --> 35:16.050
Now, this shithole is
kind of an off-the-grid place.

35:16.090 --> 35:17.630
Established comics
do not come here

35:17.670 --> 35:18.856
unless they're
trying out material

35:18.880 --> 35:20.130
they want no one to see.

35:20.180 --> 35:21.550
Bookers do not come here.

35:21.590 --> 35:23.390
You will never see Jack Paar
represented here

35:23.430 --> 35:25.220
in any way, shape or form.

35:25.270 --> 35:26.890
My father will be very relieved.

35:26.930 --> 35:28.480
What are you doing?

35:28.520 --> 35:30.480
Taking notes. Research.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.020
You gonna write everything down?

35:32.060 --> 35:34.610
Everything I think
is pertinent or interesting,

35:34.650 --> 35:36.820
or could be pertinent
or interesting.

35:36.860 --> 35:38.240
So the answer's yes.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.860
"No Jack Paar in this shithole."

35:40.910 --> 35:42.280
What's this place called?

35:42.320 --> 35:44.330
- "This shithole."
- You're kidding.

35:44.370 --> 35:46.306
Well, not officially,
but by anyone who's been here.

35:46.330 --> 35:47.926
- Hmm. -Now the good thing
about this place,

35:47.950 --> 35:49.830
it's a great spot
to catch unusual acts

35:49.870 --> 35:52.250
you might never see
anywhere else.

35:52.290 --> 35:54.000
Hey, who's this guy?

35:54.040 --> 35:55.500
He's from Montana.

35:55.550 --> 35:57.840
Huh. And what's his blood type?

35:57.880 --> 35:59.510
I don't know.

35:59.550 --> 36:01.406
Well, you told me one useless
piece of shit detail,

36:01.430 --> 36:02.816
I thought you could
throw in another.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.510
(groans)

36:04.550 --> 36:06.180
What?

36:06.220 --> 36:07.430
What are you doing?

36:07.470 --> 36:08.810
I had a funny thought.

36:08.850 --> 36:10.600
Well, by all means,
keep it a secret.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.150
All the best comics do.

36:12.190 --> 36:14.770
I should get another notebook.

36:14.810 --> 36:16.520
What on earth is he doing?

36:20.780 --> 36:25.490
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have terrible news.

36:25.530 --> 36:27.910
My best friend,

36:27.950 --> 36:30.910
my partner for many years...

36:30.960 --> 36:33.460
he was like a brother to me...

36:33.500 --> 36:35.500
Randy here...

36:38.090 --> 36:41.880
...has committed suicide.

36:41.930 --> 36:43.840
Look.

36:45.550 --> 36:47.140
Lifeless.

36:47.180 --> 36:50.140
- (laughs) -I just found him
backstage, and...

36:50.180 --> 36:52.940
he didn't even leave a note.

36:52.980 --> 36:54.600
But...

36:54.650 --> 36:57.230
the show must go on.

36:57.270 --> 37:00.280
And so I will now do
our two-man show act

37:00.320 --> 37:02.150
without him.

37:03.740 --> 37:06.740
Hey there, Randy,
how you doing tonight?

37:09.120 --> 37:11.080
And then Randy would say,

37:11.120 --> 37:15.420
"You mean
who am I doing tonight?"

37:15.460 --> 37:17.420
That would always get
a pretty big laugh.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.050
(both laugh)

37:19.090 --> 37:21.210
He had such great delivery.

37:21.260 --> 37:23.680
And then I'd say, "Randy",

37:23.720 --> 37:27.430
watch what you're saying,
there's ladies in the audience."

37:27.470 --> 37:29.720
And he'd say...

37:30.770 --> 37:32.770
And he'd say...

37:32.810 --> 37:35.770
(crying): He'd say
"How big are their tits?"

37:35.810 --> 37:39.480
(both laugh)

37:39.520 --> 37:41.480
Why is this so funny?

37:41.530 --> 37:43.900
I have no fucking idea.

37:43.950 --> 37:45.530
Hey, you don't think
this is funny?

37:45.570 --> 37:47.570
(laughing)

37:51.700 --> 37:53.660
People are funny in Montana.

37:53.710 --> 37:55.580
Oh, my God.

37:55.620 --> 37:57.226
So how come when
you're having trouble sleeping,

37:57.250 --> 37:59.380
they tell you to count sheep?

37:59.420 --> 38:01.590
I mean, sheep are
quite adorable, aren't they?

38:01.630 --> 38:03.760
Yeah, I see a little sheep
jumping over a fence,

38:03.800 --> 38:07.180
I become invested in that cute
little sheep's life story.

38:07.220 --> 38:08.970
- (laughter)
- Where's he running to?

38:09.010 --> 38:10.470
What's he running from?

38:10.510 --> 38:12.390
And now, instead
of getting sleep,

38:12.430 --> 38:14.230
I am wide awake with anxiety

38:14.270 --> 38:16.480
worrying if my new little
friend's gonna be okay.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.060
SUSIE:
Upstairs at the Downstairs.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.560
Now this is a good
mainstream club.

38:19.610 --> 38:21.270
Everybody comes here.

38:21.320 --> 38:24.400
Bookers, managers, agents,
writers come here all the time.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.740
COMIC: I'll tell you,
I like having things to do,

38:26.780 --> 38:30.530
but I hate having to do things.

38:30.580 --> 38:33.040
Same words, different order,
makes all the difference.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.290
Having things to do,
that's an option.

38:35.330 --> 38:37.540
Having to do things,
that's a demand.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.830
- (laughter) -Having things
to do, quite pleasant.

38:39.880 --> 38:43.420
Go for a walk, catch a ball
game, meet a friend for coffee.

38:43.460 --> 38:45.590
Having to do things,
never pleasant.

38:45.630 --> 38:48.260
Take out the trash,
change a lightbulb,

38:48.300 --> 38:50.220
- go visit your mother.
- (laughter)

38:50.260 --> 38:52.350
See, this guy here,
he's not really my thing,

38:52.390 --> 38:54.076
- but he's very solid.
- These are the things

38:54.100 --> 38:55.980
that we need to learn in school.

38:56.020 --> 38:58.100
Instead, they teach us
a whole bunch of things

38:58.140 --> 39:00.270
that we will never, ever use,

39:00.310 --> 39:03.150
like knowing
about the War of 1812.

39:03.190 --> 39:06.110
- (laughter) -Come to think
of it, that's all I remember.

39:06.150 --> 39:07.910
Oh, I don't remember
what that war was about.

39:07.950 --> 39:10.280
I think it was
because it was 1812.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.410
- (laughter)
- They had no radio, no TV.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.410
There was nothing to do
except go to war.

39:14.450 --> 39:16.500
"So, um, why are we at war?"

39:16.540 --> 39:18.830
"Uh, because it's 1812."

39:18.870 --> 39:22.340
- (laughter) -You see
how he waits after the laugh.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.550
Now, sometimes...
and you got to feel it...

39:24.590 --> 39:26.380
I-if you let a joke sit
long enough...

39:26.420 --> 39:28.550
(laughter)

39:28.590 --> 39:30.680
Two laughs for the price of one.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.300
COMIC:
All right.

39:32.350 --> 39:34.100
Hey, that's Marty Kahn.

39:34.140 --> 39:35.470
Is that good?

39:35.520 --> 39:37.310
Marty Kahn
is a very important Booker.

39:37.350 --> 39:40.480
He handles a lot
of the Eastern seaboard clubs.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.270
I want to meet him.

39:42.310 --> 39:44.110
- I want you to meet him.
- Okay.

39:44.150 --> 39:45.440
(exhales)
Lots of confidence.

39:45.480 --> 39:46.690
And remember.

39:46.730 --> 39:49.650
MIDGE:
I know, tits up.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.820
Marty Kahn,
how the hell are you?

39:51.860 --> 39:53.160
Susie Myerson.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.240
- Uh, my card.
- Okay.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.990
Personal management, huh?

39:57.040 --> 39:58.200
What do you manage?

39:58.250 --> 39:59.500
- I manage her.
- Singer?

39:59.540 --> 40:01.750
- Comedienne.
- Really. She funny?

40:01.790 --> 40:03.630
She's hilarious.
She's got a great, tight ten,

40:03.670 --> 40:06.340
working on some new material.
Time to expand, you know?

40:06.380 --> 40:08.760
Well, she's a looker.
I'd love to see her work.

40:08.800 --> 40:13.220
Well, I will let you know once
we have a firm date nailed down.

40:13.260 --> 40:15.026
Hey, can I get a couple more
cards for my partners?

40:15.050 --> 40:17.270
Uh, sure, Marty.

40:17.310 --> 40:19.930
- H-How many partners you got?
- Three.

40:19.980 --> 40:22.560
Uh, can two of 'em share?

40:22.600 --> 40:23.980
Okay. Here you go.

40:24.020 --> 40:25.230
Three more cards.

40:25.270 --> 40:27.230
Okay. Talk soon.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.650
Yes. Talk soon.

40:29.690 --> 40:32.410
(sighs) We better get something
off that four-card fucker.

40:32.450 --> 40:33.820
Question, should I have talked?

40:33.870 --> 40:35.320
- You did, didn't you?
- No.

40:35.370 --> 40:36.660
Oh. Yes, next time, talk.

40:36.700 --> 40:37.910
And you'll tell him my name.

40:37.950 --> 40:40.330
I didn't? Aw, fuck me.

40:40.370 --> 40:42.500
(gasps)
Ooh, that's Benny Mann.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.420
That guy's got a stranglehold
on Florida.

40:44.460 --> 40:46.040
I'm gonna go talk to him.
You stay here.

40:46.090 --> 40:48.380
Apparently,
I can't work with props yet.

40:48.420 --> 40:49.646
COMIC: ...of the world's
largest empire,

40:49.670 --> 40:50.800
and today he's a salad.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.380
I like that stool lean.

40:52.430 --> 40:55.090
Well, that is all for me,
ladies and gentlemen.

40:55.140 --> 40:56.760
My name is Howard Fawn.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.640
Thank you and good night!

40:58.680 --> 41:01.890
(cheering and applause)

41:06.270 --> 41:07.820
What are you doing?

41:07.860 --> 41:09.400
Are you stealing my act?

41:09.440 --> 41:11.490
- What? Oh, no.
- I am so sick of this.

41:11.530 --> 41:12.900
- Who sent you?
- No one.

41:12.950 --> 41:14.410
Someone out of L.A.?

41:14.450 --> 41:16.160
Hired some local girl
who knows shorthand?

41:16.200 --> 41:18.160
Hey, I'm not a shorthand girl.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.516
It wasn't Buddy Hackett, was it?
Oh, I didn't think he'd dare,

41:20.540 --> 41:22.016
not after I flattened him
the last time.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.000
- No, Buddy Hackett did not...
- Dana? Greene?

41:24.040 --> 41:25.516
- If it was Greene, I swear...
- Why do you assume

41:25.540 --> 41:27.170
- someone sent me?
- What?

41:27.210 --> 41:29.420
Why couldn't I be stealing
your act for myself?

41:29.460 --> 41:31.670
Are you kidding me?
You can't do my act.

41:31.710 --> 41:33.670
What, you think it's so hard?
I mean, frankly,

41:33.720 --> 41:36.430
other than that stool lean,
it's a fairly pedestrian set.

41:36.470 --> 41:39.010
"Fairly pedestrian."
Hackett did send you, didn't he?

41:39.060 --> 41:41.270
- That motherfucker.
- What is happening here?

41:41.310 --> 41:44.020
I am perfectly capable
of stealing your act for myself.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.690
Whoa!
Nobody's stealing acts here.

41:45.730 --> 41:47.770
And after I stole it,
I could do it better.

41:47.810 --> 41:49.796
- And in heels! -Yeah, yeah?
- Okay, we're leaving.

41:49.820 --> 41:52.360
You-you tell Hackett, he shows
his face around here again,

41:52.400 --> 41:53.796
- I'll break his other leg!
- All right!

41:53.820 --> 41:55.450
SUSIE:
What the fuck is wrong with you?

41:55.490 --> 41:57.780
Uno, dos, uno, dos, tres!

41:57.820 --> 42:00.240
(band playing)

42:02.250 --> 42:04.210
(grunts)

42:04.250 --> 42:06.620
♪ ♪

42:35.950 --> 42:38.740
♪ ♪

42:38.780 --> 42:41.330
- (bandleader grunts)
- MAN: Come on, come on, come on.

42:41.370 --> 42:43.266
- SUSIE: I appreciate this,
Lanie. -Appreciate nothing.

42:43.290 --> 42:44.846
- We have a deal.
- Well, appreciation's

42:44.870 --> 42:46.660
- a valuable commodity
these days. -Uh-uh.

42:46.710 --> 42:49.000
You promised me a prime spot
at the Gaslight for two weeks

42:49.040 --> 42:50.330
- if I got you in here.
- Yeah...

42:50.380 --> 42:52.000
Yeah, what? You promised.

42:52.040 --> 42:54.510
I know. I just...
You're so terrible.

42:54.550 --> 42:56.446
- That doesn't matter. -You
really... You have no talent

42:56.470 --> 42:58.356
- at all. -I didn't ask
for your opinion on my singing.

42:58.380 --> 42:59.776
Oh, you're a singer?
See, I just thought

42:59.800 --> 43:01.026
you had your sack caught
in your zipper.

43:01.050 --> 43:02.640
Hey! I did you a favor here!

43:02.680 --> 43:04.156
Susie, how about we save
the constructive criticism

43:04.180 --> 43:05.640
- for another time?
- All right.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.560
Prime spot for two weeks.
But practice.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.560
Do some scales, please.
I am begging you.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.650
Okay. Come on.

43:11.690 --> 43:13.980
Wait here. I have to make sure
my manager's not looking.

43:14.030 --> 43:15.230
Hey. Lanie!

43:15.280 --> 43:17.070
(groans)
Little pussy.

43:17.110 --> 43:18.700
He'd better come through.

43:18.740 --> 43:20.660
Well, welcome to the Copa.

43:20.700 --> 43:22.450
Oh, I've been to the Copa.

43:22.490 --> 43:24.200
You have?

43:24.240 --> 43:26.660
We came last year
for our anniversary.

43:26.700 --> 43:28.710
Hmm. Oh.

43:28.750 --> 43:31.710
However, I've never been
to the kitchen at the Copa.

43:31.750 --> 43:34.420
- A night of firsts.
- Mm-hmm.

43:34.460 --> 43:35.920
So, Red Skelton's
headlining tonight.

43:35.960 --> 43:37.300
You know Red Skelton?

43:37.340 --> 43:39.260
- Of course.
- You ever seen him live?

43:39.300 --> 43:41.510
No. Saw him on
Steve Allen once, though.

43:41.550 --> 43:43.930
Better live. He's great live.

43:43.970 --> 43:46.270
I mean, this guy's timing?
Rock solid.

43:46.310 --> 43:47.980
He's never off, ever.

43:48.020 --> 43:49.390
Mm.

43:49.440 --> 43:50.810
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

43:50.850 --> 43:52.036
- Red Skelton.
- Where the fuck is Lanie?

43:52.060 --> 43:53.980
- We're missing him.
- Mm.

43:54.020 --> 43:55.730
Wait, we can see him from here.

43:55.780 --> 43:57.070
SUSIE:
Where?

43:57.110 --> 43:59.700
Yeah. Life's recurring joke.

43:59.740 --> 44:01.506
- What? Oh, sorry. -RED: Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

44:01.530 --> 44:03.200
It's nice to be
at the Copa tonight.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.160
- Here. -Oh, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

44:05.200 --> 44:06.830
it's really quite
a thrill to be here.

44:06.870 --> 44:08.516
- Stand up on there.
- Yeah, I get the concept.

44:08.540 --> 44:10.040
RED:
As I was walking here tonight,

44:10.080 --> 44:13.750
there were a lot of people
outside. Someone yelled,

44:13.790 --> 44:17.170
"Red Skelton's in the crowd,
Red Skelton's in the crowd!"

44:17.210 --> 44:20.300
Everybody turned around
and looked at me, and gee,

44:20.340 --> 44:23.340
I was so embarrassed,
I was sorry I yelled.

44:23.390 --> 44:24.760
(laughter)

44:24.800 --> 44:26.156
- Y-You see how he...
- Yep, got it.

44:26.180 --> 44:27.446
- A-And you see the way...
- And then he turns around.

44:27.470 --> 44:28.680
RED:
Next week, I'm going down

44:28.720 --> 44:29.866
to the Fontainebleau Hotel...

44:29.890 --> 44:31.850
that's down
in Miami Beach, Florida...

44:31.890 --> 44:33.690
and have you ever
seen that place?

44:33.730 --> 44:36.150
Oh, this is the biggest hotel
in the world, believe me.

44:36.190 --> 44:38.360
I've played towns smaller.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.190
From your bedroom
to the bathroom,

44:40.240 --> 44:41.780
they've got Burma-Shave signs.

44:41.820 --> 44:43.200
(laughter)

44:43.240 --> 44:45.740
Goddamn, I love that guy.

44:45.780 --> 44:48.120
Fucking Lanie. I mean,
a prime spot for two weeks

44:48.160 --> 44:50.136
to get me in the room,
not to dump me in the kitchen.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.210
It's okay. I don't mind.

44:51.250 --> 44:52.580
Yeah, well, of course you don't.

44:52.620 --> 44:54.420
You've been to the Copa,
I haven't.

44:54.460 --> 44:56.380
- I'll be right back.
- Be nice.

44:56.420 --> 44:58.420
SUSIE:
Yep.

44:58.460 --> 45:01.590
RED: I was in a club
and everyone was so drunk,

45:01.630 --> 45:03.220
I could hardly see them.
(chuckles)

45:03.260 --> 45:05.090
(laughter)

45:05.140 --> 45:07.100
Oh, I had a swell time.

45:07.140 --> 45:09.930
I'll be glad when that swelling
goes down, though, uh...

45:09.970 --> 45:13.350
Oh, no, believe me,
I was as sober as the next guy.

45:13.390 --> 45:15.020
I was as sober as the next guy.

45:15.060 --> 45:17.690
Unfortunately, the next guy
was Dean Martin.

45:17.730 --> 45:19.190
(laughter)

45:19.230 --> 45:22.610
(applause)

45:22.650 --> 45:24.660
(cheering)

45:27.620 --> 45:28.990
(applause, cheering)

45:29.030 --> 45:32.000
(speaking indistinctly)

45:32.040 --> 45:33.410
(laughs)

45:33.460 --> 45:35.420
Oh, stop...
all right, keep going.

45:35.460 --> 45:39.130
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

45:41.630 --> 45:42.840
- Oh.
- We got to go.

45:42.880 --> 45:43.986
MIDGE:
What... you weren't nice?

45:44.010 --> 45:45.510
Not nice, not nice at all.

45:45.550 --> 45:47.550
- Fast walk, fast walk.
- Mm-hmm.

45:48.760 --> 45:50.930
So, your brother's smart, huh?

45:50.970 --> 45:53.980
My brother's brilliant,
just like my father.

45:54.020 --> 45:55.560
I'm so proud of him.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.100
He's working
for the military now,

45:57.150 --> 45:59.110
developing a sonar machine
that can talk to whales

45:59.150 --> 46:01.230
to tell them to get
out of the way of boats.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.086
Is that really what your brother
told you he does?

46:03.110 --> 46:05.240
I-Invents a whale-saving
machine?

46:05.280 --> 46:06.820
Yes. Why?

46:06.860 --> 46:08.950
That's cute. You're cute.

46:08.990 --> 46:10.620
Is he close with your parents?

46:10.660 --> 46:12.580
My father is closest
to my brother,

46:12.620 --> 46:14.210
and my mother's closest to me.

46:14.250 --> 46:15.960
You okay with that situation?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.380
You're asking me an awful lot
of questions tonight.

46:18.420 --> 46:20.460
Well, I find you fascinating.

46:20.500 --> 46:23.050
You're like a super coiffed
science experiment.

46:23.090 --> 46:25.880
- I thought maybe you were trying
to be friends. -What? No.

46:25.930 --> 46:28.720
I'm just trying to inspire
some thoughts for that notebook.

46:28.760 --> 46:31.140
Oh. Okay.

46:31.180 --> 46:32.890
Seems like you want
to be friends.

46:32.930 --> 46:34.520
I do not want to be friends.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.270
I'd like to be friends.

46:36.310 --> 46:38.560
You really think the military
gives a shit about whales?

46:38.600 --> 46:40.190
We went out tonight
like friends.

46:40.230 --> 46:41.916
We went out tonight
so you could learn a few things.

46:41.940 --> 46:43.110
This was school.

46:43.150 --> 46:45.360
You know my husband left me.

46:45.400 --> 46:47.780
You know my father
likes my brother best.

46:47.820 --> 46:50.200
You know my father teaches
at Columbia,

46:50.240 --> 46:51.620
my mother went
to school in Paris.

46:51.660 --> 46:53.160
You know I made
the cheerleading squad

46:53.200 --> 46:54.636
but quit because my mother
feared the bouncing

46:54.660 --> 46:56.540
would shorten the shelf life
of my breasts.

46:56.580 --> 46:58.186
Yeah, your mother's nuts.
You got to use her.

46:58.210 --> 46:59.670
I don't know anything about you.

46:59.710 --> 47:01.516
- 'Cause you don't have to.
- But maybe I want to.

47:01.540 --> 47:02.920
Look, both of our futures depend

47:02.960 --> 47:05.300
on you making jokes
about your weird life.

47:05.340 --> 47:07.090
I ask you questions
to help you figure out

47:07.130 --> 47:09.890
what painful and humiliating
moments we can exploit

47:09.930 --> 47:11.510
to make a lot of money off of,

47:11.550 --> 47:13.930
not because I care,
because I don't.

47:13.970 --> 47:15.770
You want your fries?

47:15.810 --> 47:17.430
Yes.

47:17.480 --> 47:18.890
Fine.

47:18.940 --> 47:20.600
Though you haven't
had a freaking fry

47:20.650 --> 47:22.230
in, like, the last
three minutes.

My mother washes sheets

48:05.150 --> 48:07.400
Once a year, she gets drunk
and tells us about the time

48:07.440 --> 48:09.320
she came in third
in the Miss Rockaway pageant,

48:09.360 --> 48:10.780
and then sings "Danny Boy,"

48:10.820 --> 48:13.320
which is what she did
for the talent portion.

48:13.370 --> 48:15.950
And you realize just how
great-looking she must've been

48:15.990 --> 48:19.120
if they actually gave her
anything after that racket.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.460
And then she passes out,
pisses herself,

48:22.500 --> 48:26.670

48:28.840 --> 48:30.300
Oh, he's fine.

48:30.340 --> 48:32.300
Yeah, he's a trader
at E.F. Hutton.

48:32.340 --> 48:34.220

48:34.260 --> 48:36.640

49:07.250 --> 49:08.840

49:08.880 --> 49:10.710
So, I was wondering if you

49:10.760 --> 49:11.986
maybe want
to do it again tomorrow?

49:12.010 --> 49:14.590
Not as friends,

49:14.640 --> 49:16.180

- Midge. -I'll pay for us
to get into the Copa.

49:17.510 --> 49:19.310
Inside, with a table
and everything.

49:19.350 --> 49:21.390
I can't do this again
tomorrow night; I have a job.

49:21.430 --> 49:23.270
Yeah, Mom and Dad
don't pay my bills.

49:23.310 --> 49:26.310
Right. You're right.
I-I'm sorry.

49:26.360 --> 49:28.376
Look, I'm glad this helped,
and I love the enthusiasm,

49:28.400 --> 49:30.610
but at the end of the day,
you got to know

49:30.650 --> 49:33.820
that there's really only one way
to truly master stand-up.

49:33.860 --> 49:36.200

50:02.220 --> 50:05.060
ABE:
Miriam, come in here, please.

50:11.940 --> 50:13.860
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

50:13.900 --> 50:15.200
Where have you been?

50:15.240 --> 50:16.780
You scared the daylights
out of me.

50:16.820 --> 50:19.070
- Answer me, Miriam.
- I was out.

50:19.120 --> 50:20.780
- "Out" where?
- With a friend.

50:20.830 --> 50:22.870
- What friend? -I'm sorry,
did something happen?

50:22.910 --> 50:25.710
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's late.

50:25.750 --> 50:27.420
It's 2:00 in the morning.

50:27.460 --> 50:28.830
Don't you wear a watch?

50:28.880 --> 50:30.290
Not with this outfit.

50:30.340 --> 50:32.170
We were worried, Miriam,
worried sick,

50:32.210 --> 50:33.590
if you must know.

50:33.630 --> 50:34.720
Your mother vomited.

50:34.760 --> 50:35.970
I did not vomit.

50:36.010 --> 50:37.680
Well, she did something
in the bathroom

50:37.720 --> 50:39.050
that took a very long time.

50:39.090 --> 50:42.010
And she did not come out
looking happy.

50:42.060 --> 50:44.850
- I'm sorry I was late, but...
- But what?

50:44.890 --> 50:47.020
You do know I'm not 16 anymore,
don't you?

50:47.060 --> 50:49.100
We thought we did,
but then you act like this,

50:49.150 --> 50:51.020
- sneaking out...
- I did not sneak out.

50:51.060 --> 50:52.980
- ...sneaking in.
- I did not sneak in.

50:53.030 --> 50:54.900
You left your baby here alone.

50:54.940 --> 50:56.110
With her grandparents.

50:56.150 --> 50:58.240
And where is your son, anyway?

50:58.280 --> 50:59.910
- Shooting craps.
- What?

50:59.950 --> 51:01.830
He's with Joel. Shooting craps.

51:01.870 --> 51:04.096
- Oh. -I-I'm kidding. Can we just
lighten the mood a little?

51:04.120 --> 51:06.710
No, we cannot. You know
the rules of this house.

51:06.750 --> 51:09.460
Rule number one: you do not
leave your towels on the floor...

51:09.500 --> 51:11.000
we'll get back to that,
by the way...

51:11.040 --> 51:13.050
rule number two: home by 11:00.

51:13.090 --> 51:16.010
- Are you kidding me?
- 10:00 if you keep arguing.

51:16.050 --> 51:17.380
You can't give me a curfew.

51:17.420 --> 51:19.970
I'm a 26-year-old woman,
I have two children.

51:20.010 --> 51:22.640
As long as you're living under
this roof, my rules apply.

51:22.680 --> 51:25.310
Mama, this is a tad
overdramatic, don't you think?

51:25.350 --> 51:28.310
You could've been dead
and dismembered in an alley.

51:28.350 --> 51:30.350
- Oh, my God.
- The Dionne quintuplets

51:30.400 --> 51:32.086
would be very disappointed
in you right now.

51:32.110 --> 51:33.230
I'm going to bed.

51:33.270 --> 51:34.650
That's it! I've changed my mind.

51:34.690 --> 51:36.110
No Jack Paar for you.

51:36.150 --> 51:38.280
- What? -Because of your
behavior tonight,

51:38.320 --> 51:40.030
I am not buying you a TV. See?

51:40.070 --> 51:42.120
There are consequences.
Lesson learned.

51:42.160 --> 51:43.740
Good. Now go to your room.

51:43.780 --> 51:45.990
And if I see those towels

51:46.040 --> 51:47.830
on the floor again,
you'll be air-drying

51:47.870 --> 51:49.290
for a month!

51:57.880 --> 51:59.880
(quietly):
Miriam?

52:04.430 --> 52:08.100
Don't worry. We'll get the TV in
a couple of weeks, you'll see.

52:10.230 --> 52:14.020
Do you want me
to make us some cocoa?

52:14.060 --> 52:17.230
No, thank you.

52:17.280 --> 52:21.200
Well, if you change your mind.

52:21.240 --> 52:24.120
Joel moved in with Penny,
by the way.

52:32.750 --> 52:34.380
JACK PAAR:

52:34.420 --> 52:35.880

some of the most successful
television shows

52:51.560 --> 52:54.860

have been about lawyers.
