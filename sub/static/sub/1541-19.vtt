NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.796 --> 00:06.236
DAMON: The cure to vampirism.
BONNIE: You wanted it for Elena.

00:06.382 --> 00:07.425
DAMON:
What if I don't now?

00:07.591 --> 00:10.177
If anyone tries to flip
my humanity switch back on...

00:10.344 --> 00:12.179
...I'll become your worst nightmare.

00:13.097 --> 00:14.181
MATT:
Kai, stop!

00:14.348 --> 00:15.433
[GRUNTS]

00:15.599 --> 00:17.184
Hello, Mother.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.896
You believe that I can reconnect Stefan
with his humanity?

00:21.063 --> 00:22.648
And once we've done that?

00:22.815 --> 00:24.567
Then we will go rescue my friends?

00:24.734 --> 00:28.029
They were known as heretics.
Vampires with witch power.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.740
That woman made me a monster
and then abandoned me.

00:30.906 --> 00:31.949
CAROLINE:
Who's that?

00:32.116 --> 00:34.744
It's Damon's lame attempt
to get my humanity back on.

00:34.910 --> 00:38.080
Let me guess, then you get
my humanity back on. I don't think so.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.959
I will never leave you again.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.339
Mother.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.467
You have to go after Caroline.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.801
I'll find her.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.981
Aw, an angel.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.400
How cute is this place?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.903
- It's adorable.
- Okay, so I'll bite.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.446
You hunt me down at a bar...

01:10.613 --> 01:13.199
...where I'm perfectly content
feeding on waitstaff...

01:13.365 --> 01:15.785
...so you can whine about how
your mom is a bitch...

01:15.951 --> 01:18.245
What kind of mother
doesn't love her own children?

01:18.412 --> 01:21.248
Whatever. So she spun you a web of lies...

01:21.415 --> 01:23.751
...and couldn't flip
your humanity switch back on.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.336
And now you wanna eat people.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.130
Which I am totally down for.

01:28.756 --> 01:32.718
So, what the hell are we doing
in a B&B in Grove Hill?

01:32.885 --> 01:35.805
Well, I figure we could...

01:35.971 --> 01:37.098
...take a little break.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.517
Oh.

01:39.850 --> 01:40.935
Duh.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.648
STEFAN: <i>First step, convince her
that my humanity is still off.</i>

01:45.815 --> 01:49.318
My run-in with our mother had no effect
and I wanna keep the party going.

01:49.485 --> 01:50.820
Oh, look at that.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.238
Saint Stefan has a plan.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.783
Let me guess, whoever's holding the kitten
talks about their feelings?

01:56.033 --> 01:59.036
- Torture her until she breaks.
- Sold.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.455
Do I need to remind you two
that the last time...

02:01.622 --> 02:05.417
...Caroline thought we were trying to flip
her switch she went on a killing spree?

02:05.584 --> 02:07.753
She's not gonna find out this time.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.882
- Who are you calling?
- Can I get some towels...

02:12.049 --> 02:13.551
...sent up to the room, please?

02:13.717 --> 02:14.927
Thank you.

02:15.511 --> 02:19.140
I'm hungry, so I figure we could eat
whoever brings them up.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.642
See? He'll be convincing.

02:21.809 --> 02:25.980
Say she believes you. How do you know
she's even gonna want to see you again?

02:26.147 --> 02:27.523
Oh, she'll wanna see him.

02:27.690 --> 02:31.110
- Damon, shut up.
- It's a bit of a tricky bet for you, isn't it?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.320
- She's gonna expect a lot.
ELENA: Okay.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.239
- What am I missing here?
- Nothing.

02:35.406 --> 02:36.448
ELENA:
Hang on a second.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.076
- Did you and Caroline...?
DAMON: Do it?

02:39.243 --> 02:40.703
- Yup.
ELENA: Oh.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.122
This was after she flipped...?

02:43.289 --> 02:45.624
- Never mind.
- It's not how I wanted it to go down.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.877
But I can't change it now,
so can we drop it?

02:48.043 --> 02:49.879
Okay, sore subject.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.130
Understood.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.966
- What do we do once you earn her trust?
STEFAN: Drain her blood.

02:54.133 --> 02:57.261
Make her weak, bombard her
with everything she used to care about.

02:57.428 --> 03:00.264
Memories of who she was,
her friendships, her mom.

03:00.431 --> 03:02.725
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.770
DAMON: What is that?
- Got rid of everything from her former life.

03:06.937 --> 03:10.482
Her mom had sent this letter, intending
for it to arrive after she died...

03:10.900 --> 03:13.861
...which it did, but Caroline
had already flipped her switch.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.487
- It could work.
DAMON: Sure.

03:15.654 --> 03:19.325
Unless she wants Sexy Stefan time
instead of an assault on memory lane.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.368
I'm not gonna let that happen.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.207
Now what are you doing?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.834
Just making us some drinks.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.170
Such a gentleman.

03:34.632 --> 03:35.716
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

03:36.759 --> 03:38.344
Dinner.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.267
- Towels.
CAROLINE: Ah! Unh!

03:48.312 --> 03:49.438
Sure you wanna do this?

03:50.105 --> 03:51.649
Let's just get it over with.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.192
[STEFAN GRUNTS]

04:02.868 --> 04:03.953
[GROANS]

04:05.204 --> 04:06.872
Stefan?

04:07.039 --> 04:08.290
Yeah.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.292
What happened?

04:10.459 --> 04:11.502
We got caught.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.545
[GROANS]

04:14.672 --> 04:15.714
DAMON:
Hello.

04:15.881 --> 04:16.923
Hey.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.093
- This is a surprise.
- I'm just in the 'hood.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.845
I thought I'd stop by
and bring a morning pick-me-up.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.722
Thanks. What is this?

04:23.889 --> 04:27.059
Uh, it's a mocha latte frappe-something.
I don't know. I guessed.

04:27.518 --> 04:30.604
Clearly. So Elena told me you guys
found Caroline, which is great.

04:31.146 --> 04:34.066
Funny she didn't mention anything
about a cure for vampirism.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.902
- Please don't tell me you said anything.
- I didn't.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.655
- Apparently, neither have you.
- Well, I've been busy.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.992
You know, my mom's in town.
I had to vampire-proof a B&B.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.995
Any idea how many people
I had to compel to make that happen?

04:46.161 --> 04:48.747
Quite a few, I'm assuming,
which makes me wonder...

04:48.914 --> 04:51.625
...how you had time
to bring your bud a coffee. Hmm?

04:52.167 --> 04:55.170
Do you ever hear of April Lyrids?
Yeah, me neither.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.464
It's a stupid comet my mom
thinks she'll use...

04:57.631 --> 05:00.175
...to pull her friends
out of the 1903 prison world.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.303
But we're not letting her people out.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.139
Well, I may have reinforced
that possibility...

05:05.306 --> 05:07.683
...when I gave the ascendant
to her for safekeeping.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.518
You what?

05:10.853 --> 05:12.438
Come here.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.026
Damon, you were the one that said
her friends are vampires who can do magic.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.194
I think the PC term is witch-pire.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.613
The term is freaks
we've never dealt with before.

05:21.780 --> 05:26.201
It doesn't matter because she needs you to do
the spell to open the door to 1903, Bonnie.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.871
- So she's gonna come looking for me.
- So we stall her.

05:29.038 --> 05:33.375
Look, Lily's like a bill collector. Dodge her
calls long enough she'll leave you alone.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.795
No. Eventually, they shut your power off.

05:38.213 --> 05:41.342
You better fix this
before she becomes my problem.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.595
Don't ever show up here
pretending to care about me again.

05:49.016 --> 05:53.937
Oh. Did I tell you? I got us
into that cute bakery right off campus.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.524
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- To taste a wedding cake?

05:57.691 --> 05:58.817
For our wedding?

05:59.318 --> 06:00.402
Oh.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.447
I don't need to remind you.
It's right around the corner.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.450
This is where I pretend to care
about how our cake tastes.

06:06.617 --> 06:10.788
I pulled a rummy all-nighter at a B&B we're
supposed to be scouting for the wedding.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.081
You can care about cake.

06:13.791 --> 06:17.920
Did I mention that the cute bakery is right
next door to an even cuter tequila bar?

06:18.087 --> 06:20.464
Mm. Tequila.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.758
My favorite. Gin. Again.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.676
How many is that?

06:32.434 --> 06:33.769
Oh, um, ahem.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.272
Elena. Hey.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.776
- We're keeping a close eye on your friends.
- Yeah, real close.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.736
Yeah, I can see that.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.029
Yeah.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.531
Good news.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.699
Your shift's over. I'm here to relieve you.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.495
In that case, I'm just gonna head
to the honeymoon suite.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.500
Supplies are right here.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.919
Cards are right there
just in case you get bored.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.631
- Supplies. Cards. Got it.
- Yeah, great. So we'll see you in a few hours.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.092
- Ric?
- Yeah?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.886
It's really nice to see you happy.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.638
Oh, thanks.

[CAROLINE GRUNTING]

07:11.682 --> 07:13.142
I think they're awake.

07:13.308 --> 07:16.145
So have fun with that.

07:20.732 --> 07:21.775
Okay.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.993
They vampire-proofed a B&B.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.120
How did they even know we were here?

07:34.037 --> 07:35.539
Why are you so calm?

07:35.706 --> 07:38.083
- Help me.
- Because I already tried.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.043
You're wasting your energy.

07:40.210 --> 07:45.716
Every move I make feels like sandpaper
rubbing against my veins.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.092
They're drying us out.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.844
First, they drain our blood.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.053
Then they starve us.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.681
I know how desiccation works, Stefan.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.477
Ah-ah. I wouldn't do that if I were you.

07:56.643 --> 08:01.023
I can literally feel my cells shrinking.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.859
You do realize that vodka
to a desiccating vampire...

08:04.026 --> 08:05.694
...is like saltwater to a human.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.029
What's with the lecture?

08:07.196 --> 08:08.363
Just shut up...

08:16.288 --> 08:19.500
Let me guess,
humanity police was your idea.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.086
We really want you back, Caroline.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.381
Remember that time Jeremy died
and you turned off your humanity...

08:26.590 --> 08:30.219
...and tried to kill the prom queen,
a.k.a. your best friend Bonnie?

08:30.385 --> 08:32.261
I forget, Stefan, was that before...

08:32.429 --> 08:35.182
...or after she killed some waitress
for no reason?

08:35.349 --> 08:36.433
I think it was after.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.726
[CHUCKLES]

08:37.893 --> 08:40.979
You see, Stefan and I
are just finding it a little ironic...

08:41.145 --> 08:45.859
...that you think you're qualified to tell us
how to deal with the death of a loved one.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.779
I'm not here to preach to you, Caroline.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.864
I just came to show you this.

08:52.241 --> 08:56.453
This letter from your mom arrived at our
dorm just a few days after her funeral.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.498
Apparently, there was something
she wanted to tell you.

09:07.089 --> 09:09.091
Does this look real to you?

09:11.510 --> 09:14.221
Her impeccably perfect handwriting?
Yup.

09:15.097 --> 09:18.267
Yeah, I remember when she taught me
how to write my name in cursive.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.355
So what?

09:23.522 --> 09:28.402
Am I supposed to read this and snap back
to sad, pathetic, motherless Caroline?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.698
- Burn it.
- What?

09:33.156 --> 09:36.243
Did I say stand there and look stupid?
No.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.579
I said, burn it.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.541
Well, maybe I should read it first.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.167
Why do you care?

09:44.334 --> 09:46.461
What happens if you get
your humanity back...

09:46.628 --> 09:50.090
...and hate me for destroying the last
thing your mom wanted to say to you?

09:50.257 --> 09:53.969
Did those words seriously
just come out of your mouth? God.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.892
Burn it. Now.

No.

Sorry, Elena.

Great. She's early.

Stall her till I find what I need.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.500
Okay.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.256
Thought you were off
learning to be a sheriff.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.009
Thanks to Stefan and Caroline,
I can barely tie my shoe.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.513
- What, are you here to stalk someone?
- I'm through with all that.

11:19.763 --> 11:22.933
I've decided a direct approach is best.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.103
- One of your diners owes me answers.
- I can't have any trouble.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.648
That will depend on how
this conversation goes.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.485
I know you.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.780
- You came to my house a few days ago.
- Yes.

And as chance would have it,
your son and I are old friends.

My God.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.082
Lorenzo.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.793
- It's you.
- So you two know each other?

11:51.253 --> 11:53.338
The phrase "small world" comes to mind.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.465
So does "epic understatement."

11:58.051 --> 12:01.805
My lunch companion has yet to arrive.
Won't you join me for a drink?

12:02.264 --> 12:03.932
Don't mind if I do.

That was my ace in the hole.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.441
I blew it.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.402
Look.

12:15.944 --> 12:20.115
The fact that you suck at torturing people
is nothing to be ashamed of.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.993
That's why you have me.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.788
At least Alaric and Jo can cross this
off their list of honeymoon options.

- Mm-hm.

They didn't want to have to fly anywhere.

before I gave birth to my fictional baby? No.

But not here.

Above the bar that you work at.

in your fantasy?

Okay, you own the bar.

And when you're not working there,
you're on our couch...

13:14.169 --> 13:17.756
...pouring me wine and massaging my feet
after a long day at the OR.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.592

DAMON: Nice technique.

Stefan's in here too. Annoy him.

Because Stefan didn't
snap a barback's clavicle in half.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.095
It's really quite sad, actually.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.640
I could see Liz right now
calling the parents...

15:31.806 --> 15:34.809
...breaking the news, wondering
where she went wrong as a mother.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.978
She got cancer, Damon.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.480
That is where she went wrong.

15:38.647 --> 15:40.982
Oh. Blame her.

just be more like you and Elena...

give birth to babies...

move and start over every five years.

Shut up, Caroline.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.938
I'm just stating the facts, Elena.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.065
Yeah, you don't want this life.

16:22.941 --> 16:26.903

fantasy land all you want...

the one where you're a vampire...

16:29.739 --> 16:31.282

with a side of fries or skins.

I would never do that, Lorenzo.

headless corpses again.

just to preserve our rations.
