00:03.962 --> 00:07.250
According to the box,
each mission's authorized by Oversight.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.297

I'm a member of Oversight.

the sooner you're safe.

The situation is critical.

Our entire effort,
everything we worked for...

00:37.079 --> 00:39.320
...is in danger of being destroyed.
And why?

00:40.165 --> 00:41.666
Because of one person.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.242
Nikita.
She is determined...

00:45.462 --> 00:47.919
...to bring down Division at all costs.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.874
And she feels the quickest way to do
that is to target its sponsors.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.553
Two of us are dead now...

until we join them.

I could go to the president,
request Secret Service protection.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.769
And tell him what?

01:11.947 --> 01:14.905
That the shadow government
that he's not even aware of...

01:15.075 --> 01:18.112
...can't stop an assassin
that it created?

You gonna track all that sand
in here?

01:23.125 --> 01:25.582
-l'm not the maid, you know.
-Clearly.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.757
You know, Division doesn't
even need to kill you...

01:33.927 --> 01:35.758

01:37.306 --> 01:40.594
Your boy, Owen, ugh, lost track of
the last two somewhere near Brussels.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.678
I'm helping him
with sat surveillance...

01:42.894 --> 01:45.476

to find a needle in a needle stack.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.933
Mikey's on his way back here.

He thinks the guardians
are en route to the States.

trying to swipe my pain pills.

You know, you can stay here

is to get high again...

02:31.693 --> 02:33.854

somewhere else.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.187
Um....

Those are one of the things
my mom was taking.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.321
You know, to make herself numb
and push the pain away.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.198
The truth, ugh....

02:48.877 --> 02:53.246
Alex, I was a part of the operation
against your family that night...

02:53.465 --> 02:55.330
...and even I don't know the truth.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.958
Maybe she doesn't either.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.341
She was having an affair
with the man who killed my father.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.883
And she is living with him
in the house that I grew up in.

03:07.479 --> 03:10.391
Doesn't mean she was
a part of the attack or the takeover.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.476
It doesn't matter.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.900
You're gonna have to
find a way to let this go.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.744
Before Division...

03:33.922 --> 03:36.538
...there was a woman
at a halfway house.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.294
Her name was Carla.

03:40.595 --> 03:44.383
"This is a safe place,"
she used to say.

03:44.558 --> 03:49.302
And I remember hearing that
meant so much to me.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.640
And then one day she left town.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.144
No goodbye, no nothing.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.906
...off the wagon,
and landed in prison.

04:17.299 --> 04:20.632
All I remember thinking
was that she never came to visit me.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.090
On death row, not once.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.430
And I remember feeling like
I would never forgive her for that.

04:34.983 --> 04:39.602
And I thought there has to be
a reason why she did what she did.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.564
And whatever that reason was...

04:44.993 --> 04:47.279
...I think it was supposed to help me.

While we're on the subject of disasters,
let's talk about Alexandra Udinov.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.868
I seem to recall her sitting down
with us and striking a deal.

against Sergei Semak...

05:41.508 --> 05:43.169

-Amanda's.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.008
Well, you're making my point.

The problem, as you say,
is deeper, systemic.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.934

What do they have in common?

06:02.195 --> 06:05.687
-Division.
-Our problem's Division.

06:06.533 --> 06:11.402
-Maybe we need new leadership.
-We already tried that.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.286
Amanda was no better than Percy.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.873
Division's grown too powerful
for anyone to run it.

Really? Have you figured out
a way to tell time down here?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.412
I would have thought
after conferring with your asset...

06:59.586 --> 07:01.247
...that you'd come straight down.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.580
There's nothing you told Fletcher

you're planning an escape.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.125
Which we both know is impossible.

07:10.305 --> 07:13.763
"Impossible" is a word found
only in the dictionary of fools.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.513
You're a little tall
to be quoting Napoleon.

07:17.729 --> 07:23.941
His exile did last nearly a year
and, uh, you're right, I'm not that patient.

07:24.110 --> 07:28.228
Well, take a look around, Percy.
There is no way out of here.

was built to withstand...

08:14.160 --> 08:19.530
...a Soviet nuclear strike. We can handle
anything that is thrown at us.

08:19.749 --> 08:23.617
That does not mean, however, that we
will sit back and play defense.

the sooner we eliminate it.
