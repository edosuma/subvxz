WEBVTT

00:00.383 --> 00:02.800
(school bell ringing)
Okay, Holly,

00:02.815 --> 00:05.169
Will Schuester, Mr. Figgins,

00:05.203 --> 00:06.403
Brad the piano player?

00:06.438 --> 00:08.138
Oh, that's easy.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.307
I'd bang Will Schuester,
marry Figgins,

00:10.342 --> 00:12.510
and push Brad the piano player
off a cliff.

00:12.544 --> 00:13.844
What? No way.

00:13.879 --> 00:16.079
Holly, I'd marry Will and
have sex with Figgins.

00:16.114 --> 00:19.049
See, I've gotten real
good at getting my soul

00:19.084 --> 00:21.152
to float above my body
when I'm doing the nasty.

00:21.186 --> 00:22.586
So I'd cringe my way

00:22.621 --> 00:24.388
through a sweaty hump
session with Figgins,

00:24.422 --> 00:26.457
and bone Will Schuester
well into my 60s.

00:26.491 --> 00:27.725
Oh, fantastic.

00:27.759 --> 00:29.493
Well, well, well.

00:29.528 --> 00:31.262
If it isn't April Rhodes,

00:31.296 --> 00:33.731
America's favorite
alcoholic dwarf whore.

00:33.765 --> 00:35.132
Oh, thank you, Sue.

00:35.167 --> 00:37.501
Holly and I were just playing
Kill, Marry, or Bone.

00:37.536 --> 00:38.702
Well, April,

00:38.737 --> 00:40.104
as you have absolutely
no business whatsoever

00:40.138 --> 00:41.272
on this campus, normally,

00:41.306 --> 00:42.706
I would have you
physically removed.

00:42.741 --> 00:44.208
However, since you seem
to be hanging out

00:44.242 --> 00:47.745
with the willowy
and winning Holly Holliday,

00:47.779 --> 00:49.513
(laughs) I am willing

00:49.548 --> 00:51.389
to make an exception.
Hey, girl.

00:51.416 --> 00:52.550
Thanks, Coach.

00:52.584 --> 00:54.084
Wait a second. You
guys know each other?

00:54.119 --> 00:55.686
Oh, you bet
your sweet ass we do.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.354
Yup, the minute
I met Miss Holliday,

00:57.389 --> 00:58.689
we immediately hit it off,

00:58.723 --> 01:00.691
and we've been best of friends
ever since.

01:00.725 --> 01:02.927
Mm-hmm. We're auditioning
for <i> The Amazing Race.</i>

01:02.961 --> 01:04.929
I'm Principal Sue Sylvester.

01:04.962 --> 01:06.597
And I'm Substitute
Holly Holliday.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.232
And together we are...

01:08.266 --> 01:10.201
BOTH:
Team Gorgeous!

01:10.235 --> 01:12.236
SUE: <i> As a seven-time
national championship</i>

01:12.270 --> 01:14.972
<i>cheerleading coach, I know what</i>
<i>it's like to work as a team.</i>

01:15.006 --> 01:17.641
(sputtering)

01:17.676 --> 01:19.944
<i>And I'm looking forward</i>
<i>to the physical challenges.</i>

01:19.978 --> 01:21.812
HOLLY: <i> And I'm looking
forward to eating</i>

01:21.847 --> 01:23.481
<i>those half-formed</i>
<i>fetal duck eggs!</i>

01:23.515 --> 01:25.716
(both yelling)

01:25.750 --> 01:29.453
So, Sue, um, April and
I were just talking...

01:29.488 --> 01:31.889
No. I'm sorry, Holly.
The glee club's over.

01:31.923 --> 01:34.725
Okay, I know. I just, um...
I was just thinking,

01:34.760 --> 01:36.460
you know, just 'cause
Glee Club is over

01:36.495 --> 01:38.395
doesn't mean that there can't be

01:38.430 --> 01:39.697
any music at the school, right?

01:39.731 --> 01:41.065
What you getting at, Holly?

01:41.099 --> 01:43.067
HOLLY: I mean, you
know, there are plenty

01:43.101 --> 01:44.802
of other clubs in this school.
Maybe we could

01:44.836 --> 01:47.071
work a little music into some of them.
That's right, Holly.

01:47.105 --> 01:49.440
You know, it's a proven fact,
when you put music

01:49.474 --> 01:51.142
in the classroom,
test scores go up.

01:51.176 --> 01:52.910
Oh, please, dear God, shut up.

01:52.944 --> 01:54.945
Sue, we're just
asking for one week.

01:54.980 --> 01:57.915
Fine. You have one week
to somehow shoehorn

01:57.949 --> 02:00.684
music into McKinley's
extracurricular clubs.

02:00.719 --> 02:03.854
But, please, see if you can't
involve William in this somehow.

02:03.889 --> 02:06.657
It'll soften the blow
of the glee club's cancellation.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.925
(school bell ringing)

02:08.960 --> 02:11.762
(laughter)

02:11.797 --> 02:13.037
Ooh!

02:16.001 --> 02:17.635
(school bell ringing)

02:17.669 --> 02:19.570
TINA: <i> This time in a
person's life is supposed</i>

02:19.604 --> 02:21.084
<i>to feel fresh</i>
<i>and full of possibility.</i>

02:21.106 --> 02:23.474
<i>But unlike every other senior</i>
<i>at this school,</i>

02:23.508 --> 02:26.010
<i>I seem to be the only one</i>
<i>still waiting by the phone</i>

02:26.044 --> 02:27.445
<i>to be invited to the dance.</i>

02:27.479 --> 02:30.414
<i>I got rejected by</i>
<i>my backup school, Ohio State,</i>

02:30.449 --> 02:32.329
<i>and Brown still hasn't told me</i>
<i>if I got in yet.</i>

02:32.350 --> 02:35.386
<i>And at this point,</i>
<i>I'm taking desperate measures.</i>

02:35.420 --> 02:38.155
<i>I get it. I was adopted,</i>
<i>and I've never been to temple.</i>

02:38.190 --> 02:40.190
<i>But all of my friends</i>
<i>are going to be in New York,</i>

02:40.192 --> 02:41.692
<i>and Mitzvah is the only school</i>

02:41.726 --> 02:44.028
<i>that is still accepting</i>
<i>for fall semester.</i>

02:44.062 --> 02:46.230
<i>I wrote an essay about why</i>
<i>the reason I'm applying so late</i>

02:46.264 --> 02:48.899
<i>was because I was on a kibbutz,</i>
<i>whatever that is.</i>

02:48.934 --> 02:51.502
<i>So, here we go.</i>

02:51.536 --> 02:52.937
<i>Fingers crossed.</i>

02:52.971 --> 02:55.172
<i>I just got to get</i>
<i>to New York somehow.</i>

02:55.207 --> 02:58.976
Well, what are you guys doing?

02:59.010 --> 03:00.878
Well, Mr. Shue wanted us
to pack away the trophies

03:00.912 --> 03:03.392
before Sue came in and
had the Cheerios! do it.

03:04.182 --> 03:07.218
No, don't get upset. Oh.
I'm upset.

03:07.252 --> 03:09.220
Guys, you might want to sit down
for this. I have some huge news.

03:09.254 --> 03:12.389
You guys got married and adopted
Russian twin babies. Yes!

03:12.424 --> 03:14.925
Blaine got into NYADA!
I got into NYADA!

03:14.960 --> 03:16.594
Oh, my God!
Congratulations!

03:16.628 --> 03:17.595
(overlapping chatter)

03:17.629 --> 03:19.163
Congratulations.

03:19.197 --> 03:21.165
Wow! Oh, my God! You guys,
do you know what this means?

03:21.199 --> 03:23.100
All of us... we're all going
to New York together!

03:23.135 --> 03:25.002
(whoops) Oh!

03:29.541 --> 03:32.877
You guys, we're gonna
miss our shift!

03:34.045 --> 03:35.212
Ew!

03:35.247 --> 03:36.080
Oh.
Hey! Hey!

03:36.114 --> 03:37.248
If I wanted to watch men

03:37.282 --> 03:38.883
in capri pants
slobbering all over each other,

03:38.917 --> 03:40.384
I'd watch <i> Monday Night Football.</i>

03:40.419 --> 03:41.419
(canned laughter)

03:41.453 --> 03:43.454
(theme music playing)

Advertise your product or brand here

04:07.612 --> 04:09.480
(applause and cheering)

04:09.514 --> 04:13.083
Whoa! Man, those ten flights
of stairs are a bitch.

04:13.118 --> 04:14.785
I wish this apartment
had an elevator.

04:14.820 --> 04:15.453
It does.

04:15.487 --> 04:16.487
Now you tell me!

04:16.521 --> 04:17.588
(laughter)

04:17.622 --> 04:18.822
(audience member whistling)

04:18.857 --> 04:20.958
Sam, where are your clothes?

04:20.992 --> 04:23.227
Oh. I think I left 'em
at the Laundromat.

04:23.261 --> 04:25.162
(laughter) Again?

04:25.197 --> 04:27.031
Aah! Rachel, quit
hogging the bathroom!

04:27.065 --> 04:29.066
RACHEL: I'm never
coming out of here!

04:29.101 --> 04:31.021
That's what I said
sophomore year of high school.

04:31.036 --> 04:32.436
(applause and cheering)

04:32.471 --> 04:35.005
I'm serious!
Open the G-dang door!

04:39.742 --> 04:42.222
I'm never getting
spray-tanned again

04:42.247 --> 04:43.481
at a Vietnamese doughnut shop.

04:43.515 --> 04:45.149
Where do we keep the ketchup?

04:45.183 --> 04:46.703
ALL:
Mike Chang!

04:46.718 --> 04:47.918
What are you doing here?

04:47.953 --> 04:50.187
I'm here to win Tina back.

04:50.222 --> 04:53.124
Did I say that out loud?

04:53.158 --> 04:55.226
Also, I'm here to teach
dance to the homeless,

04:55.260 --> 04:57.695
and I brought a few
chums to help me out.

04:57.729 --> 04:59.497
(noise-makers sounding)

04:59.531 --> 05:01.799
(applause and cheering)

05:01.833 --> 05:03.267
Sam, where's your clothes?

05:03.301 --> 05:05.669
Oh. I knew I forgot something.

05:05.704 --> 05:07.972
(canned laughter)
(sitcom musical sting)

05:08.006 --> 05:09.974
Oh, my gosh, Tina,
I-I'm so sorry.

05:10.008 --> 05:12.376
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm great.

05:12.410 --> 05:14.879
You guys, New York,

05:14.913 --> 05:18.382
it's gonna be amazing.

05:18.416 --> 05:21.318
MERCEDES: You know, being here
with everyone has brought

05:21.353 --> 05:24.188
so many good feelings
and memories,

05:24.222 --> 05:26.123
and... I mean, look
at Puck and Quinn.

05:26.158 --> 05:27.658
I mean, I have no idea
what's going on there,

05:27.692 --> 05:28.826
nor do I know
where her boyfriend

05:28.860 --> 05:31.462
ran off to, but it looks
like we can be expecting

05:31.496 --> 05:33.664
another "accidental"
pregnancy sometime soon.

05:33.698 --> 05:35.332
(whoops) Yeah, yeah.

05:35.367 --> 05:37.301
Yeah! KURT: But, alas,

05:37.335 --> 05:40.838
with the old good feelings
come the old bad ones, too.

05:40.872 --> 05:43.007
Why, just today, Mercedes and I
were in the lunch line

05:43.041 --> 05:44.775
when a battle from
way back in the day

05:44.810 --> 05:46.444
came out,
a-and we found ourselves

05:46.478 --> 05:47.878
at each other's throats again.

05:47.913 --> 05:50.714
They have zero
nutritional value.

05:50.749 --> 05:52.716
Listen,
potatoes are vegetables, okay?

05:52.751 --> 05:54.385
And Tots are made from potatoes.

05:54.419 --> 05:57.555
Ergo, Tots are vegetables.

05:57.589 --> 06:00.357
Well, I'd like some kind of proof of
how much potato is actually in there.

06:00.392 --> 06:01.525
And ruin the mystery?

06:01.560 --> 06:04.195
What in the hell is wrong
with you? Move it.

06:04.229 --> 06:07.364
Yes, I know. It's really
hard to see friends fighting,

06:07.399 --> 06:09.266
but I'm just glad that none of
you guys were there to see it.

06:09.301 --> 06:10.668
I was right behind you in line.

06:10.702 --> 06:13.537
Because the most upsetting thing
is watching two people you love

06:13.572 --> 06:15.840
fight about
something ridiculous

06:15.874 --> 06:18.042
and there not being anything
you can do to stop it.

06:18.076 --> 06:21.879
But, thankfully, we made up
and we have never been closer.

06:21.913 --> 06:23.881
- Mmm. - And we've decided
to heal our hearts

06:23.915 --> 06:25.282

(school bell rings)

09:19.740 --> 09:21.675
You remember when we first met?

09:21.709 --> 09:23.410
I was in here doing my hair...

09:23.444 --> 09:26.012
Are you trying to make peace with
me by getting all nostalgic?

09:26.047 --> 09:27.847
Because, if so, you are
forgetting the one thing

09:27.882 --> 09:30.362
that you should have learned
from all of our magical time

09:30.384 --> 09:32.152
together, and it's
that I have no heart.

09:32.186 --> 09:34.321
Look, I've been unkind
to you, okay?

09:34.355 --> 09:36.323
And-and I won't get
into the whole thing

09:36.357 --> 09:38.325
about how watching Kurt and Mercedes
sing got me all sentimental

09:38.359 --> 09:40.327
because I know you'll just
make fun of me for it.

09:40.361 --> 09:42.529
No, you know what?
Go ahead, please.

09:42.563 --> 09:45.465
Because if I don't express
my venom at least once a day,

09:45.499 --> 09:46.733
I get constipated.

09:46.767 --> 09:47.867
I want to give you ten shows.

09:47.902 --> 09:50.570
Any ten shows after
the first three months,

09:50.604 --> 09:52.038
all right?

09:52.073 --> 09:54.908
And you can pick. They can be
ten in a row or one at a time.

09:56.210 --> 09:57.377
It's a peace offering.

09:57.411 --> 09:59.879
That way, your mom can come
or your <i> abuela.</i>

09:59.914 --> 10:02.148
I just... I don't want
to do this anymore.

10:02.183 --> 10:03.817
It's exhausting
and it's depressing.

10:03.851 --> 10:07.153
(chuckles) No.

10:07.188 --> 10:08.688
I want them all.

10:08.723 --> 10:10.390
The only reason
why you're doing this

10:10.424 --> 10:12.192
for me is because you know
that I'm gonna go

10:12.226 --> 10:13.660
all <i> Showgirls</i> on you and win.

10:13.694 --> 10:15.695
No more scraps, Rachel.

10:15.730 --> 10:18.098
I will be happy
and kiss and be friends

10:18.132 --> 10:19.599
once you give me the part.

10:19.634 --> 10:22.936
God, what is it about anymore
with you, Santana?

10:22.970 --> 10:24.537
I just... I don't get it.

10:27.642 --> 10:29.376
Yeah.

10:31.777 --> 10:34.257
I'm just not sold
on the whole idea.

10:34.282 --> 10:36.116
Will, this is going
to work. I swear.

10:36.150 --> 10:38.051
You just have to trust me.
Okay...

10:38.085 --> 10:41.621
(Southern accent): Hey there,
Animal Husbandry Club!

10:41.656 --> 10:44.958
I'm animal rights activist
Temple Grandin!

10:44.992 --> 10:46.760
Overcoming autism

10:46.794 --> 10:48.895
gave me insight into how

10:48.929 --> 10:51.932
to slaughter livestock
in a more humane way.

10:51.966 --> 10:56.403
I think in pictures, not words,
and I'm hypersensitive

10:56.437 --> 10:58.805
to loud noise!

10:58.839 --> 11:03.076
But that don't mean I don't know
how to party. Hit it!

Oh, my God.

13:50.778 --> 13:52.112
Are these all lilies?

13:53.147 --> 13:55.115
They're the lesbian of flowers.

13:58.653 --> 14:00.553
I also...

14:00.588 --> 14:03.723
got you this.

14:04.759 --> 14:08.595
Two tickets to Lesbos Island?

14:08.629 --> 14:11.531
But these are
both one-way.

14:11.565 --> 14:14.668
Yeah, I figured once we arrived
at the girl-on-girl paradise

14:14.702 --> 14:17.504
that is Lesbos
that we'd never want to leave.

14:20.474 --> 14:22.442
Okay, listen.

14:22.476 --> 14:24.044
Brittany, I love you, but

14:24.078 --> 14:26.713
running away with me and
living on a lesbian island

14:26.747 --> 14:28.548
is not what you want to do.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.284
You just don't want
to go back to MIT.

14:31.319 --> 14:32.953
And you shouldn't.

14:32.987 --> 14:35.855
Just because your amazing
mathematical mind can solve

14:35.890 --> 14:38.458
all the world's problems
doesn't mean that it has to.

14:38.492 --> 14:41.595
It's not your dream, and
neither is being with me.

14:41.629 --> 14:42.862
You're one to talk.

14:42.897 --> 14:45.165
Since when is becoming a
Broadway star your goal in life?

14:45.199 --> 14:47.719
A star is a star. It doesn't
matter where in the sky I shine.

14:47.735 --> 14:50.170
I don't want to run away with
you because I want to run away.

14:50.204 --> 14:51.805
I want to run away
with you because

14:51.839 --> 14:54.307
you and I are the only truly
awesome people I've ever met,

14:54.342 --> 14:55.642
and I'm tired of doing stuff

14:55.676 --> 14:57.344
that only matters
to people less awesome than us.

14:57.378 --> 15:01.114
Okay, but this isn't
like your math stuff.

15:01.148 --> 15:03.383
I'm going to be
rich and famous.

15:03.417 --> 15:05.452
This is a great
first step for me.

15:05.486 --> 15:08.121
And, besides, I'm not gonna
let that dwarf Berry win.

15:08.155 --> 15:10.390
(clicks tongue)

15:10.424 --> 15:12.392
Listen...

15:12.426 --> 15:15.629
you have spent most
of your life in the closet

15:15.663 --> 15:18.798
because you cared about
what people thought about you.

15:18.833 --> 15:20.700
Walking away from a dream

15:20.735 --> 15:23.069
that you don't actually
care about is you winning,

15:23.104 --> 15:24.838
because it's you saying,

15:24.872 --> 15:27.707
"This is not who I am,
and I don't care who knows it."

15:27.742 --> 15:29.743
(laughs quietly)

15:31.445 --> 15:33.413
You know, it's funny.

15:33.447 --> 15:37.183
I spend months
tangled up in knots,

15:37.218 --> 15:39.853
and in five minutes,
you straighten me out.

15:39.887 --> 15:41.254
Mm.

15:41.289 --> 15:43.256
You really are a genius.

15:43.291 --> 15:44.991
I'm just the world's
foremost expert

15:45.026 --> 15:46.726
in the field of Santana Lopez.

15:46.761 --> 15:48.028
(laughs)

15:48.062 --> 15:52.265
So... what do you want to do?

15:57.686 --> 15:58.853
(school bell ringing)

15:58.887 --> 16:00.221
(sighs)
My life is literally over.

these flowers come from?

16:02.391 --> 16:03.524
BLAINE:
What's wrong, Tina?

16:03.558 --> 16:04.959
Nothing. Just the fact
that I'm going

16:04.993 --> 16:06.794
to spend the rest
of my life in Lima

16:06.828 --> 16:08.429
because I'm not Jewish enough.

16:10.732 --> 16:13.334

16:15.370 --> 16:16.971
<i>However, we know the truth.</i>

16:17.005 --> 16:18.673
<i>Your name is not Tina Cohen.</i>

16:18.707 --> 16:21.442
You are Tina Cohen-Chang.

16:21.476 --> 16:23.644
You are a big, fat liar.

16:23.679 --> 16:25.212
I didn't get into Mitzvah,
so I guess

16:25.247 --> 16:27.648
I'm the only one in this room
who's not going to New York.

16:27.683 --> 16:30.017
Why? You don't need a college
acceptance letter to get over

16:30.052 --> 16:32.119
that bridge. I can't just go
there without some kind of plan.

16:32.154 --> 16:34.755
Well, uh, Kurt did, and I think
he's doing pretty great.

16:34.790 --> 16:37.391
It's an adventure. Not for me.
You don't understand.

16:37.426 --> 16:39.226
Without some kind of
direction, I just feel

16:39.261 --> 16:41.329
like a giant,
free-floating loser.

16:41.363 --> 16:42.763
Yeah, like me.

16:42.798 --> 16:44.231

19:32.834 --> 19:35.036
Hey, please, please, please,
please come to New York.

19:35.070 --> 19:36.537
You don't need a plan.
You'll figure something out

19:36.571 --> 19:38.172
once you get there.
We can get an apartment.

19:38.206 --> 19:39.540
You guys are the best.

19:40.442 --> 19:41.342
Let's do this.

19:41.376 --> 19:43.077
ALL:
Yeah.

19:43.111 --> 19:44.178
(cheering) (whoops)

19:44.212 --> 19:45.413
Nick, I'm a good friend
of yours,

19:45.447 --> 19:46.847
and in a dumb way,
I'm kind of smart.

19:46.882 --> 19:48.416
So I'm gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

19:48.450 --> 19:49.951
You ought to marry me.

19:49.985 --> 19:51.665
So I'm gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

19:51.687 --> 19:53.054
- You ought to ma...
- Well...

19:53.088 --> 19:54.855
you certainly are dedicated.

19:54.890 --> 19:56.824
Well, under normal
circumstances I would be,

19:56.858 --> 19:58.098
but considering the fact

19:58.126 --> 20:00.194
that I have to worry
about you pushing me

20:00.228 --> 20:03.097
off the stage at any moment,
I can't slip, even for a second.

20:03.131 --> 20:05.399
Well, I don't like that.

20:05.434 --> 20:07.435
You have been

20:07.469 --> 20:10.905
dreaming about this role
since you were in gay-utero.

20:10.939 --> 20:12.873
And you have actually worked

20:12.908 --> 20:14.408
your tiny butt off to get it,

20:14.443 --> 20:16.711
and I'm coming and sucking
all the celebration out of it.

20:16.745 --> 20:18.880
Why?

20:18.914 --> 20:21.048
Honestly, like,
what have I ever done to you?

20:21.083 --> 20:22.717
Nothing.

20:22.751 --> 20:25.419
I'm just not a
particularly nice person.

20:25.454 --> 20:27.154
And sometimes I make choices

20:27.189 --> 20:29.924
that seem like the right thing
at the time, but then,

20:29.958 --> 20:31.893
looking back,
they're actually kind of mean.

20:31.927 --> 20:33.828
Listen, I don't want
to be a Broadway star.

20:33.862 --> 20:35.730
I'm too lazy
to do eight shows a week.

20:35.764 --> 20:39.267
Wait. So, does... does that mean
that you're quitting the show?

20:39.301 --> 20:43.471
I texted gay-face director
ten minutes ago,

20:43.505 --> 20:45.806
and said, "I hereby

don't get all sentimental
on me or anything like that.

20:52.281 --> 20:55.249
I'm really happy for you,
but I didn't do this for you.

20:55.284 --> 20:57.118
I did this entirely for myself.

20:57.152 --> 21:00.655
I know,
and that was very brave of you.

21:00.689 --> 21:04.358
But do you think
that we could maybe at least

21:04.393 --> 21:06.494
sing a song together
in the glee club?

21:06.528 --> 21:09.931
Fine. But I'm not gonna sing
some tired old song

21:09.965 --> 21:11.732
that we've already done.
'Cause Santana Lopez

21:11.767 --> 21:14.569
is way too badass for that.

23:32.508 --> 23:36.144
the National Autism Association,
as well as One Million Moms.

23:36.178 --> 23:37.812
Although in actuality, there
aren't a million of them.

23:37.846 --> 23:39.480
There's really only 100,000,

23:39.515 --> 23:42.550

is an uptight bitch.

I'm sorry about this, Sue.

Oh, finally.
I'm in love with you, too.

Just give me a second.
I'm gonna send Kitty

'Cause, you know,
we've never actually dated.

caution to the wind and say yes.

27:43.524 --> 27:45.325
if you'd keep your
inevitable snark to yourself.

27:45.359 --> 27:46.726
No, no. Look,
I got to be honest,

27:46.760 --> 27:48.194

that brings us full circle,

So, we don't actually
know your name

29:30.965 --> 29:33.266
because this video was
made before you were born,

Will Schuester.

29:41.075 --> 29:44.111
past middle age, maybe
a little beaten down by life.

29:44.145 --> 29:46.113
But we want to tell you
about what your dad was like

29:46.147 --> 29:47.347
when he was young.

When he could dance
like Fred Astaire.

MARLEY:
And sing like Michael Bublé.

29:50.752 --> 29:51.885

29:51.919 --> 29:53.420
Your dad and I almost hooked up,

29:53.454 --> 29:54.888

I could have been your mom.

30:02.697 --> 30:04.131

But I still would've been living

30:07.135 --> 30:08.435
You had to be there.

30:08.469 --> 30:10.037
Okay, it may seem
a little weird to you,

30:10.071 --> 30:11.938
but back here in the Dark Ages,

30:11.973 --> 30:14.541
it was still crazy
for girls to love girls

30:14.575 --> 30:15.876
and guys to love guys,

30:15.910 --> 30:17.711
but your dad made sure

30:17.745 --> 30:19.546
that we felt safe

31:40.428 --> 31:42.796
with as much care and concern
as he does for you.

31:42.830 --> 31:47.634
We love your dad.
We love him very, very much,

31:47.669 --> 31:51.004
and no matter where we are
or what we're doing,

31:51.039 --> 31:52.939
he's with us.

31:52.974 --> 31:55.442
Because we have his name
tattooed in our hearts.

35:27.246 --> 35:29.766
You done good, Holly Holliday.

35:29.791 --> 35:31.792
You, too, babe.

35:31.826 --> 35:33.293
Our work is done here.

35:33.328 --> 35:36.496
We did it flawlessly and
looked flawless while doing it.

35:36.531 --> 35:38.031
Amen.

35:38.066 --> 35:39.733
Hey, do you want
to go get drunk,

35:39.767 --> 35:41.435
rob a bank and sail
around the world

35:41.469 --> 35:42.903
on one of those
gayboy cruise ships?

35:42.937 --> 35:46.039
We'd be the only women there
and get all the attention.

35:46.074 --> 35:47.274
(slow gasp)

35:47.308 --> 35:48.742
I thought you'd never ask.

35:48.776 --> 35:50.777
(both giggle)

35:57.764 --> 36:00.244
Kitty, when you
see me in the hall,

36:00.269 --> 36:01.603
will you say hello?

36:01.637 --> 36:03.571
Of course. Someone's
got to tell you your shoes

36:03.606 --> 36:04.773
don't match your purse.

36:04.807 --> 36:06.975
Cheerio, please.
My shoes always match.

36:07.009 --> 36:10.745
I cannot believe that Sue
Sylvester finally shut us down.

36:10.780 --> 36:13.181
She won.

36:13.215 --> 36:15.216
She actually won.

36:19.826 --> 36:21.866
You guys, you're gonna
miss my big moment.

36:21.891 --> 36:24.125
Get your butts
to the auditorium.

36:25.659 --> 36:28.139
Hang on a second.

36:28.164 --> 36:31.566
Sue Sylvester didn't win.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.435
Maybe she took away Glee Club,

36:33.469 --> 36:35.937
but she'll never
take away what we had.

36:35.971 --> 36:38.640
We were part
of something incredible.

36:38.674 --> 36:39.974
It was more than that.

36:40.009 --> 36:41.543
You know, we helped
each other become

36:41.577 --> 36:44.279
better people in this room.

36:44.313 --> 36:47.115
No one can ever
take that away from us.

36:47.149 --> 36:48.383
(sighs)

36:48.417 --> 36:52.420
Come here. Bring it in, guys.
Come here.

36:52.455 --> 36:54.189
You remember Superman?
I do, that was good.

36:54.223 --> 36:56.658
That was good. This broom is
poking me in places I don't...

36:56.692 --> 37:00.261
Arthur Abrams.
(applause)

37:00.296 --> 37:02.297
(whooping, cheering)

37:07.536 --> 37:08.870
Blaine Anderson.

37:12.074 --> 37:14.175
Tina Cohen-Chang.

37:18.314 --> 37:20.849
Sam Evans.

37:23.119 --> 37:24.786
Rebecca Jackson.

37:29.859 --> 37:31.826
(whooping, cheering)

37:44.273 --> 37:47.842
Blaine, you guys, I can't
go to New York with you.

37:47.877 --> 37:50.311
Tina Cohen-Crazy. You can't
get cold feet on us now.

37:50.346 --> 37:51.780
No, it's not that.

37:51.814 --> 37:53.615
I was gonna tell you later, but

37:53.649 --> 37:56.351
the Dean of Admissions from
Brown called me this morning...

37:56.385 --> 37:59.220
And you got in? I got in.
I'm going to Brown!

37:59.255 --> 38:00.622
Oh! Tina. Congratulations.

38:00.656 --> 38:01.856
Wow, that is great.

38:01.891 --> 38:03.525
(laughing): Thank you.

38:03.559 --> 38:04.893
And, finally...

38:05.828 --> 38:07.896
Brittany S. Pierce.

38:07.930 --> 38:10.732
(cheering, applause)

38:12.802 --> 38:15.236
I called in some
favors with Sue.

38:15.271 --> 38:18.239
I figure that everybody deserves
a high school graduation,

38:18.274 --> 38:20.542
even if it's a year late.

38:20.576 --> 38:22.711
(kiss) (exclaims)

38:22.745 --> 38:26.648
You guys, I'm graduating.
(whooping)

38:29.716 --> 38:32.196
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

38:32.221 --> 38:35.690
the William McKinley High
graduating class of 2013.

38:35.725 --> 38:36.925
(whooping)

38:47.003 --> 38:49.037
Brittany, I have
to tell you something.

38:49.071 --> 38:50.639
I think I've made
a huge mistake.

38:50.673 --> 38:52.774
You don't want to run away
with me, do you. What?

38:52.808 --> 38:55.510
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Of course I do.

38:55.544 --> 38:58.647
(groans) I was doing some
research on Lesbos island,

38:58.681 --> 39:01.383
and it turns out that it's not
chock-full of lesbians.

39:01.417 --> 39:03.518
It's full of German
tourists, so,

39:03.552 --> 39:05.120
I bought us our return tickets.

39:05.154 --> 39:08.189
I think that we should
go to Lesbos first,

39:08.224 --> 39:10.025
and then Hawaii
for a couple of weeks,

39:10.059 --> 39:11.059
and then come home.

39:11.093 --> 39:12.927
Well, I don't want
to go back to MIT

39:12.962 --> 39:14.596
and I can't return to Lima.

39:14.630 --> 39:18.133
I want you to come
to New York with me.

39:18.167 --> 39:20.568
Is that a yes?
Yes.

39:20.603 --> 39:22.604
(soft laugh)

39:27.276 --> 39:29.411
(sighs)

39:29.445 --> 39:31.212
Here for one last
verbal beatdown?

39:31.247 --> 39:33.515
These are my last two

39:33.549 --> 39:35.250
Razzle Dazzle Fruit
Punch wine coolers

39:35.284 --> 39:36.818
from my cellar.

39:36.852 --> 39:39.421
Company went out of
business back in the '80s,

39:39.455 --> 39:42.891
and I've been saving them
for a special occasion.

39:42.925 --> 39:45.727
Well, what could be more special
than the glee club's funeral?

39:45.761 --> 39:46.828
Mm.

39:49.365 --> 39:51.900
Well... (exhales)

39:51.934 --> 39:53.935
You finally won.

40:00.276 --> 40:03.678
Honestly, I-I don't get the
way you see the world, William,

40:03.713 --> 40:05.513
but I got to give you this:

40:05.548 --> 40:07.248
whatever it is you
did in this room,

40:07.283 --> 40:09.951
you changed a lot of kids'
lives for the better.

40:09.986 --> 40:12.520
And your own.
As you know,

40:12.555 --> 40:14.789
I find both of your
spouses intolerable

40:14.824 --> 40:18.126
and bony, but at least
this one is kind to you.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.628
Yeah, I'm not gonna miss this.

40:19.662 --> 40:22.063
Oh, I am.

40:22.098 --> 40:24.499
Nobody ever went the
distance with Sue Sylvester

40:24.533 --> 40:26.067
the way you did, Will.

40:26.102 --> 40:27.636
My whole life

40:27.670 --> 40:31.039
I've been searching for
a worthy adversary.

40:31.073 --> 40:33.041
(sighs)

40:33.075 --> 40:35.395
I'm gonna miss the fight.

40:36.879 --> 40:38.346
I could have done more.

40:38.381 --> 40:41.483
There's still so many
more kids out there.

40:41.517 --> 40:43.785
Well, who says you can't?

40:43.819 --> 40:46.187
Listen, William, you were
a horrible history teacher

40:46.222 --> 40:48.556
and you were a worse
Spanish teacher.

40:48.591 --> 40:50.692
If you're going to be
of any good to anybody,

40:50.726 --> 40:52.360
you need to be
coaching a glee club.

40:52.395 --> 40:54.329
Which is why I got
you an interview

40:54.363 --> 40:56.843
for the open slot
at Carmel High.

40:57.133 --> 40:58.533
Vocal Adrenaline?

40:58.567 --> 41:02.304
Think of what you could
accomplish with a real budget.

41:02.338 --> 41:03.538
And without somebody like me

41:03.573 --> 41:05.240
constantly trying
to take you down?

41:05.274 --> 41:06.808
Wow.

41:06.842 --> 41:08.610
I mean, tha-that's
really amazing, Sue,

41:08.644 --> 41:10.512
but they're our mortal enemies.

41:10.546 --> 41:14.416
There is no "our"
anymore, William.

41:14.450 --> 41:16.930
We're in the middle of
the new computer lab.

41:18.218 --> 41:20.698
You did what you could do here.

41:20.723 --> 41:22.624
And that was much more

41:22.658 --> 41:25.138
than I will ever care to admit.

41:26.829 --> 41:28.330
But it's really over.

41:29.932 --> 41:32.173
It's only an interview.

41:33.769 --> 41:36.010
You could always blow it.

41:44.180 --> 41:45.714
Oh, God, that's awful.

41:45.748 --> 41:48.450
Yeah, that's why they
went out of business.

41:48.484 --> 41:50.285
I'll give you a minute.

41:54.590 --> 41:56.424
(door closes)

41:58.594 --> 42:00.595
