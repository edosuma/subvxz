WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:05.293
- ( electronic buzzing )
- ( door clangs )

00:05.464 --> 00:09.127
Man:
Fire, earthquake, flood.

00:09.301 --> 00:12.088
- ( man #2 shouting )
- You bought it all, didn't you?

00:12.262 --> 00:13.718
That's not a question.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.754
I'm not asking, I'm telling you.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.426
I look at a person
like you and I know.

00:20.604 --> 00:23.937
You are a buyer.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.563
How do I know?

00:25.734 --> 00:29.192
Because I am a closer.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.445
I can sell anything,
everything.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.446
Ask anyone.

00:35.244 --> 00:39.738
Except, uh, insurance.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.576
( chuckles )

00:41.750 --> 00:43.786
Can't stomach it.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.576
Preying on people so weak,

00:45.754 --> 00:49.872
so frightened of the future
that they entrust the protection

00:50.050 --> 00:51.961
of their family
to a piece of paper.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.548
- ( sobbing )
- To some promise of a corporation.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.303
What kind of man does that?

00:57.474 --> 01:01.262
Puts his wife and children
in the hands of strangers.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.142
People he's never even met.

01:03.313 --> 01:07.272
Then one day...

01:07.442 --> 01:09.569
the man is gone.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.644
His family alone.

01:14.324 --> 01:18.658
The wolf comes to the door.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.946
And, well,

01:22.124 --> 01:24.160
no one is covered for that.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.835
(sobs)

01:26.003 --> 01:28.665
Douglas, what's wrong?

01:28.839 --> 01:31.251
Buck up.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.667
I think I found you a bright side.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.427
I presume this is the wife.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.839
Maria.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.975
Did Maria keep herself up?

01:43.145 --> 01:44.510
What?

01:44.688 --> 01:47.851
Her figure, Douglas.
Hershape.

01:48.025 --> 01:52.359
Does the current Mrs. Doug

01:52.529 --> 01:54.485
still resemble
the woman in this picture?

01:56.158 --> 01:58.023
Yeah.

01:58.201 --> 02:02.114
See there, now?
I'd say your luck is changing.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.539
Absolutely.
( chuckles )

02:08.170 --> 02:11.287
Body like that...
( chuckles )

02:11.465 --> 02:13.956
it's just the ticket
to help her latch on

02:14.134 --> 02:16.546
to the kind of man
that's gonna help her through all this.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.386
(sobbing )

02:37.574 --> 02:39.155
All right, open up.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.575
I don't know
what came over him.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.907
(sobbing )
What--?

02:45.082 --> 02:46.697
- Let's go.
- Douglas: What are you doing?

02:46.875 --> 02:49.491
- ( gate closes )
- Man: Guard!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.410
-( Douglas sobbing)
- ( man shouting )

02:51.588 --> 02:53.499
- Soldier: Open the gate.
- Man: We got rights!

02:53.674 --> 02:56.916
- ( chatter over P.A. )
- ( gate opens )

03:00.097 --> 03:03.555
So, then...

03:05.227 --> 03:07.092
who the hell are you?

03:12.275 --> 03:14.561
(theme music playing )

03:31.795 --> 03:32.875
Tell me,
you fascist pricks.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.252
Man on bullhorn:
Cease your hostile action

03:34.423 --> 03:35.959
and return to your home.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.466
Tell me where she is,
you asshole!

03:39.636 --> 03:41.376
( clears throat )

03:41.555 --> 03:44.467
Come out here, you coward.
I'm gonna show you hostile.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.472
Man:
Take it easy.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.726
What are you afraid of? You know
they're not here to protect us.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.808
You've seen what they do.
When are you gonna step up?

03:52.983 --> 03:54.644
Huh?
When they come for you?

03:54.818 --> 03:56.604
When they come
for your family?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.279
Why are you hiding?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.109
I want my mother.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.161
- Wait, hold up.
- Step aside, Corporal.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.946
What are we doing here, man?

04:10.125 --> 04:11.786
What's it look like?
Your girlfriend popped her top.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.416
She's inciting the natives.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.248
Lieutenant says
I got to nip this thing.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.504
You got exactly three seconds
to get your hand

04:18.675 --> 04:20.791
off my stripes or I will
plant you where you stand.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.675
Screw Moyers, man.
You don't have to do this.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.679
- Three...
- Listen, man, these are people here.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.259
- ...two...
- These are our people, okay?

04:27.434 --> 04:30.926
- ...two...
- She just wants her mom.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.345
Look at her, Sarge.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.979
Think I like this shit?

04:35.150 --> 04:37.186
Acting like some
power-tripping 5-0?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.021
Hmm?
I got a family, too.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.152
I know.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.529
( radio chatter)

04:42.699 --> 04:45.156
Let me handle it.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.863
You better.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.868
( gate buzzes )

04:51.333 --> 04:53.289
Go ahead,
I wouldn't blame you.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.831
( bottle shatters )

05:02.052 --> 05:03.542
(sighs)

05:06.890 --> 05:08.721
Hey.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.848
Look at me.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.563
Let me take you home, okay?

05:20.987 --> 05:22.898
I can't-- I can't
go back there. I can't.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.904
Adams: It'll be okay.
We'll get you home now.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.567
- Ofelia: You would take me?
- I'm not doing this anymore.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.158
Sergeant, impress upon your man
the importance of his duty or I will.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.368
Yes, sir.
Corporal, halt.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.080
I said stop!

05:44.094 --> 05:45.709
I'm gonna go.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.598
| just got to talk
to Moyers, you know.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.431
If we can just-- hey.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.101
Get any sleep?

05:59.526 --> 06:01.608
So what's the plan?

06:01.778 --> 06:03.109
Oh, we were just
talking about it.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.441
Shouldn't I be a part
of the discussion?

06:05.615 --> 06:08.106
| just think that someone should be
looking out for Mom's best interests.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.776
- We're looking out for everyone.
- Are we?

06:10.954 --> 06:13.070
We know you're upset, Chris.
We all are.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.113
Madison, would you please
not interrupt me

06:15.292 --> 06:17.954
while I'm talking to my father
about family matters, okay?

06:18.128 --> 06:20.744
Dad, get off me.
Get off me. Get off me!

06:20.922 --> 06:22.878
Bet if that was her, you'd be chewing
through the chain-link right now.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.256
What the hell is wrong with you?

06:25.427 --> 06:27.213
Chris, look at me.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.589
Mom-- she just got
on the truck, Dad.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.803
Look, Jesus,
we don't know what happened.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.640
They didn't take her. No one
forced her. She just went willingly.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.305
Because she wants
to help people.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.439
She knows they need her.
Like Nick, Griselda.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.943
That's who your mom is.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.105
- What if she dies, Dad?
- Hey, Chris.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.568
Don't go there.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.576
I need you to be
strong now, okay?

06:52.746 --> 06:55.158
I can't hold us
together on my own.

06:55.332 --> 06:58.165
All right?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.291
Good man.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.422
Go and apologize.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.296
- To her?
- Yeah.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.181
- Are you kidding me?
- You were out of line.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.850
Go be with
your family, Dad.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.858
( door opens, slams)

07:25.028 --> 07:26.768
I'm sorry.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.654
He didn't mean it.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.361
When Chris comes back,
tell him I've gone to get his mom.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.360
And Nick.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.199
Yeah.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.166
(motors whirring )

07:55.225 --> 07:57.216
( man coughs)

07:57.394 --> 07:59.976
Good.
You're a quick study.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.058
- Get any sleep?
- A little.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.973
Hope you enjoyed it.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.688
I'm down to three nurses
including Hodges here.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.693
Started with seven,

08:09.864 --> 08:11.900
but command,
in their infinite wisdom,

08:12.075 --> 08:14.532
sent my two best
in the first evac, so...

08:14.703 --> 08:16.193
What happened
to the other two?

08:18.248 --> 08:20.364
New dressing on this leg.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.659
My point is
you came at a good time.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.543
Nobody expects you
to be a superstar.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.375
Liza: I need to talk to my son.
He'll be worried.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.540
Of course.
I'll see what I can do.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.925
And the woman I came in with.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.551
Griselda Salazar.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.929
She's in recovery.
They had to take her foot.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.181
I'd like to see her.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.092
She doesn't speak much English.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.102
I don't want her to be scared.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.104
Right, we wouldn't want
anyone to be scared.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.231
Liza: What about Nick?
Is he okay?

08:47.402 --> 08:49.563
He's fine.
We have work to do, Liza.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.794
(chimes tinkling)

09:18.141 --> 09:19.927
Alicia?

09:20.935 --> 09:22.971
Alicia, are you in here?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.558
(loudthud)

09:29.235 --> 09:30.896
Yeah, come on.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.777
( loud bang )

09:52.258 --> 09:54.249
( loud bang )

10:04.521 --> 10:06.682
Shit.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.164
- Man on radio: Warlock?
- What? Wait, wait, wait.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.379
( radio chatter
conﬁnues)

10:37.554 --> 10:40.387
What is this?
What the hell is this?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.553
- She's got a knife.
- Stop, stop, stop.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.718
- Answer me. What is this?
- Stop, stop.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.056
This is how
we bring them home.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.656
- Drink.
- ( military radio chatter)

11:11.546 --> 11:13.753
You're worried
about your family, | get it.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.414
But this isn't necessary.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.926
They're gonna be fine.
They'll be evaluated and treated.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.757
That's all this is.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.092
You'll have them back.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.757
When?

11:25.935 --> 11:28.517
I don't know.
Soon.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.724
It wasn't right how it was handled.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.730
Handled?

11:32.901 --> 11:34.687
You came into my home at night.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.398
You took my son, his wife.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.278
- That wasn't me.
- Ofelia: It wasn't.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.939
He didn't have
anything to do with it.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.778
We know it wasn't you.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.783
Madison:
Where are they now?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.740
Look...

11:49.459 --> 11:50.995
I can help.
I want to help you.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.876
Then answer the question.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.958
| wish I could.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.418
- He doesn't know.
-( radio chatter continues )

12:03.097 --> 12:05.634
( door opens, slams)

12:05.808 --> 12:08.140
- This is not the way to do--
- Somebody had to do something.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.426
Someone is.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.640
Travis went to talk to them.
He knows the lieutenant.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.430
That's your plan?
Go back to the people who took them

12:14.609 --> 12:15.894
and, what, ask nicely?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.605
No, we have a plan.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.144
You have
a United States soldier

12:19.322 --> 12:20.732
strapped to a chair
in a goddamn basement.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.943
Yes. Now we have
something to trade.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.278
- Trade? What do you expect--
- We wait.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.616
Once they find out
he's missing, we call.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.496
We tell them where to go.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.282
We tell them where
we're gonna meet to trade.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.825
And then when they
come looking?

12:34.003 --> 12:35.834
I don't like this either, but...

12:37.423 --> 12:38.833
my father's right.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.677
It's the only thing
they understand.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.926
( speaks Spanish )

12:46.140 --> 12:48.517
This was your idea?

12:48.685 --> 12:51.347
- Yes.
- It's absurd.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.977
They're not gonna trade.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.684
I know that.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.315
But that soldier
has information.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.522
He knows the whereabouts
of my wife.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.358
He knows where
they have your boy.

13:02.532 --> 13:06.616
Security, how many soldiers
there are with him.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.152
How much time we have left.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.197
I've seen this before.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.707
People that go out on trucks
never come back.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.868
That's not
gonna happen here.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.336
Go home.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.125
Keep Ofelia there.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.546
Do not let her come
back to this house.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.511
I don't want you to hurt him.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.512
Do you want your boy back?

13:38.234 --> 13:39.895
So which is it?

13:40.069 --> 13:42.401
You don't want him hurt
or you don't want to know?

13:50.413 --> 13:52.244
You took three
of my people, sir.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.906
l quarantine at-risk
elements of the local populace.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.665
At risk for what?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.667
How long are you
planning on keeping them?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.669
Well, you got to take that up
with lady doctor Exner. It's her show.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.877
- Fine. How do | talk to her?
- You don't.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.917
Travis, I'm gonna shoot
straight with you, okay?

14:06.095 --> 14:07.756
You've been very helpful to me.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.592
I don't like doing
knock-knock raids on civilians.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.598
It's bad for morale.
But look at these guys.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.851
These guys are not warriors.
These are kids.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.854
These are little kids
who want to go home to mama.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.605
Okay?
Or what's left of her.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.609
Dark thoughts, Travis.
That's my enemy here.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.111
Okay?
So the best thing I can do

14:25.281 --> 14:27.397
is keep these kids out
in the field kicking ass

14:27.575 --> 14:29.406
and shooting holes
in skin bags.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.740
Cheer up, son. I've been places
where they shoot back.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.779
You said you were a teacher
or something, right?

14:34.957 --> 14:36.868
- Yes, sir.
- That what you said?

14:37.043 --> 14:38.783
Still am, sir.
English Lit.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.373
Okay, good, so you get it.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.629
Young men, you got to keep them
challenged. Got to keep pushing them.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.291
Okay, look what
we do here. Look.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.255
83 of these.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.136
83 of the rotten bastards,
all confirmed.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.306
That's a lot.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.560
Yeah, that's a lot.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.721
That's a company record.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.642
Can you help me get
my people back or not?

15:06.239 --> 15:08.776
| get that you got
issues with protocol,

15:08.950 --> 15:11.441
but I can't concern myself
with civilian problems.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.986
If the ones you took
don't come back soon,

15:15.164 --> 15:17.155
you're gonna have more
than me to worry about.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.456
You took 11 people. It's a tight-knit
community. A lot of kids.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.962
( helicopter blades whirring )

15:25.133 --> 15:28.170
Probably be bad for morale
if they all came down here.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.130
That a threat?

15:30.304 --> 15:34.172
No, sir.
I'm just being helpful.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.096
Okay, Manawa.
Let's go see the doc.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.482
What? I thought you said
you couldn't do that.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.358
No, I said you couldn't do that.
I can do anything I want.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.362
I got guns.
I mean, Christ, man.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.443
The dead may be
walking among us,

15:51.617 --> 15:53.699
still United States of America.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.532
I want your team
Oscar Mike in six.

15:56.706 --> 16:00.324
Mr. Mayor here would
like to go downtown.

16:01.711 --> 16:02.951
- Sir.
- Yeah?

16:03.129 --> 16:05.791
Maybe we could get
somebody else this time.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.297
First squad's pretty banged up.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.301
My men have been awake
for 50 hours, sir.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.507
We lost Nevins last night.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.387
50?

16:17.185 --> 16:18.516
Here you go.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.636
Take that.
You got to share it.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.055
'Cause | only have one.
Get your ass back in the truck.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.895
- Open.
- ( gate buzzes )

16:27.069 --> 16:28.229
( radio chatter)

16:28.404 --> 16:31.237
Please don't blame Ofelia
for this situation.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.398
She's frightened for her mother.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.739
You understand?
That's why she brought you to me.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.405
My daughter,
she cares for you.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.744
And I care for her, sir.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.910
Ofelia is very special.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.329
She's kind, intelligent,
beautiful.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.544
Yes, sir, she is.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.922
When she was born,

16:54.096 --> 16:57.259
I knew I was looking
at the only pure thing

16:57.433 --> 16:59.719
I would ever have.

16:59.894 --> 17:03.512
She was so innocent.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.898
She still is innocent.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.401
Before she brought you in,
she made me promise

17:10.571 --> 17:13.108
that I would not harm you,
that we would talk,

17:13.282 --> 17:15.398
and that I would exchange you

17:15.576 --> 17:17.783
for my wife's return.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.123
That is not gonna happen.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.876
Look...

17:30.383 --> 17:33.125
we set up command
at a college two miles east of here.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.918
There's a field hospital.
That's where your wife is, okay?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.968
(stammering )
You can ask me anything.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.633
lwon't hold nothing back.
I am--

17:42.812 --> 17:45.770
hey, look, I'm an open book.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.807
I'll tell you whatever you want.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.728
I know.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.491
I know.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.994
(murmuring)

18:09.088 --> 18:10.328
Let me get this straight.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.121
You're going downtown,

18:12.300 --> 18:14.632
through this mess of D2
flesh-eating whatnot

18:14.802 --> 18:16.008
to get some kid
who ain't your son,

18:16.178 --> 18:17.588
some old woman
who ain't your mom,

18:17.763 --> 18:19.014
and some lady
who ain't your wife?

18:19.181 --> 18:21.092
Actually, she's my ex-wife.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.349
( laughs )
No.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.851
Yeah.
What happened to your face?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.762
Nothing, sir.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.851
Momentary lapse
of patriotism.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.017
-( knocking on roof)
- Now?

18:32.194 --> 18:34.321
- You got to be kidding me.
- Hoo-ra! We got one. Stop the truck.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.864
Sir, I don't think
this is the best time for--

18:36.032 --> 18:37.647
For what, Castro?
Doing our duty?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.861
I don't know what side
you're on.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.618
Corporal,
summon the Mamba.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.128
She's a ripe one.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.054
Moyers:
How many points?

19:02.892 --> 19:04.848
First floor, east corner.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.395
900 yards.
Five-mile-an-hour crosswind.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.647
- Come on, Castro.
- Castro: Three points, sir.

19:11.817 --> 19:15.025
Three? You know I don't do anything
for less than a touchdown.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.156
All right, Mr. Mayor...

19:22.244 --> 19:23.984
guess you're up.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.745
Me? No, no.
|-- I can't.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.999
Yeah, you can.
It's easy.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.376
No, I can't.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.002
I'm not a good shot.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.879
( chuckles )

19:36.050 --> 19:39.087
It's a tactical
mil-dot scope on a bipod.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.252
Helen Keller
could drill this thing.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.761
Soldier:
He don't want to do it, sir.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.048
You a conscientious
objector, Travis?

19:45.226 --> 19:46.306
- Okay, hold on.
- Someone who likes to...

19:46.477 --> 19:47.592
...live under the protection...

19:47.770 --> 19:49.931
- All due respect, sir--
- ...and eat our MREs...

19:50.106 --> 19:51.266
- You're not listening, sir.
- ...and sleep in a cozy bed...

19:51.440 --> 19:52.429
...with his pretty wife,

19:52.608 --> 19:54.564
but when it comes to getting
his hands dirty, he doesn't want--

19:54.735 --> 19:57.192
- I'll do it, sir.
- Hell, no, you won't!

19:57.363 --> 19:59.354
Hell, no.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.613
Travis, I want
to know what it is.

20:04.787 --> 20:08.029
'Cause you don't think
that she's human, do you?

20:09.458 --> 20:12.416
'Cause if you do,

20:12.586 --> 20:15.043
if that's what you think,
then we're just a bunch of murderers.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.630
Is that it?

20:18.801 --> 20:21.258
No.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.215
- Okay.
- No, that's not it.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.970
Okay.

20:31.647 --> 20:35.310
This is a .50 cal,
so cheek on the stock.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.561
Tight to the shoulder.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.946
Press the trigger,
don't pull.

20:42.116 --> 20:43.822
Open your mouth.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.233
Pressure differential.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.992
You'll pop
your damn retina, man.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.842
Castro:
That ain't a person.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.278
That's what I thought.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.138
( radio chatter echoing )

21:57.316 --> 22:00.023
(screaming, gunfire on radio)

22:05.407 --> 22:07.819
(engine starts)

22:07.993 --> 22:09.824
(tires squeal )

22:13.082 --> 22:15.038
( radio chatter)

22:21.382 --> 22:23.668
He's in.
You can start packing.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.507
Soldier, can you hear me?

22:31.559 --> 22:33.424
He's blue.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.513
Cyanosis.
Chest contusion.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.019
What are we
looking at here?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.599
Collapsed lung.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.856
Very good.
Tube him.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.524
Another fracture.
Facial abrasions.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.940
Possible concussion.
Oh, shit!

22:49.118 --> 22:50.949
Are those bite marks?

22:51.120 --> 22:52.906
| see bite marks.
Corpsman.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.786
- We got one.
- Man: We have a quarantine.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.448
- On me, let's move.
- All right, we're clear.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.792
(gas hissing )

23:09.096 --> 23:11.087
Anything that looks
like a bite is.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.551
You're trying to save six people,
I'm trying to save 600,000.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.058
And that means one slipup,
one "what if"

23:16.228 --> 23:18.469
and we all start finding out
how the neighbors taste.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.559
- Man on radio: Where's that evac?
- Stay sharp. More on the way.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.146
(men shouting on radio)

23:24.320 --> 23:25.981
We got a squad pinned
down in a library.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.645
We're gonna get them out.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.814
So when we roll up on this bitch,
you stay in the truck.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.448
Man on radio:
We gotta move!

23:31.619 --> 23:33.735
(men shouting on radio)

23:46.008 --> 23:48.670
Squatters probably.
Whole bunch must have turned.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.505
I thought this area
was evacuated.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.964
It was.
These are the holdouts.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.128
Some people
don't trust the government.

23:53.307 --> 23:56.299
- Imagine that.
- No matter what, stay in the truck.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.843
Man:
Light these guys up.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.854
( cocks gun )
Ready? Go.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.656
(gunfire)

24:12.451 --> 24:14.692
(gunfire continues)

24:14.870 --> 24:16.485
Man on radio:
Go, go!

24:16.664 --> 24:18.871
( men screaming )

24:19.041 --> 24:21.202
We're cornered.
Get out!

24:21.377 --> 24:23.618
There's too many!
There's too many!

24:23.796 --> 24:25.787
(shouting, gunfire
conﬁnue)

24:25.965 --> 24:28.798
( man screaming )

24:28.968 --> 24:30.708
- ( gunfire, shouting continue)
- Man on radio: Behind you!

24:30.886 --> 24:32.877
- Get 'em off! Get 'em off!
- Behind you!

24:33.055 --> 24:35.216
(shouting echoes)

24:35.391 --> 24:38.007
There was a fence

24:38.185 --> 24:40.892
just like the one
surrounding us now.

24:41.063 --> 24:44.897
Inside the fence
was a building.

24:47.736 --> 24:51.695
In the building a room.

24:51.865 --> 24:55.232
And in the room a chair,

24:55.411 --> 24:57.993
just like this one where you sit.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.661
This is where they bring me.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.245
l was young.

25:06.588 --> 25:09.330
The man with the blade
and the man in the chair,

25:09.508 --> 25:11.590
they're not different.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.921
They both suffer.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.212
Their lives are changed forever.

25:18.559 --> 25:21.596
They bring me in

25:21.770 --> 25:23.886
and they give me a choice.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.393
Which man will I be?

25:29.445 --> 25:32.232
Please.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.442
Please stop.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.948
( radio chatter)

25:38.287 --> 25:40.528
This word,

25:40.706 --> 25:42.617
it's used many times
in your radio transmissions,

25:42.791 --> 25:45.373
so I know it's important.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.409
What is Cobalt?

25:51.884 --> 25:54.717
( sobs, groans )

25:57.598 --> 26:01.261
The outer layers
have less nerves.

26:02.644 --> 26:06.478
The deeper,
the more sensitive.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.145
You need a steady hand.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.233
- What is Cobalt?
- I don't know.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.656
- ( carving)
- ( groans)

26:21.830 --> 26:23.821
(sobbing )

26:26.418 --> 26:27.453
(bike bell rings)

26:27.628 --> 26:29.243
Have you no respect
for private property?

26:29.421 --> 26:32.458
- Is that your bike?
- I'll ask the questions.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.465
I'm kind of the law
in these parts.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.922
( sighs ) Yeah, we already
got people on that.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.507
Yeah, they're federal.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.467
This here is my jurisdiction.

26:41.642 --> 26:44.429
Everything from the fire hydrant
to the Posada mailbox.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.343
(bike bell rings)

26:51.693 --> 26:53.354
You want to talk about it?

26:55.322 --> 26:58.189
- Hop on.
- You got to be kidding me.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.112
I'm not.

27:01.286 --> 27:04.574
Come on, I want
to show you something.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.704
- ( music playing in background )
- Chris: Whose place is this?

27:06.875 --> 27:08.456
- ( motor whirring)
- Alicia: I don't know, rich people.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.458
Last to move in,
first to get out.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.869
Chﬁs:
What if they come back?

27:12.047 --> 27:13.332
"Classic Girl"
playing in background

27:13.507 --> 27:16.249
Alicia:
They're not coming back.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.382
Chris: Can you believe
all this stuff?

27:18.554 --> 27:21.717
These little bastards are having
the childhood we deserved.

27:27.521 --> 27:32.060
J‘ Such a classic girl J‘

27:45.414 --> 27:50.033
J‘ Such a classic girl J‘

27:50.210 --> 27:57.048
J‘ Gives her man a great idea J‘

27:57.217 --> 27:59.594
J‘ And hears you tell
your friends J‘

27:59.761 --> 28:01.342
J‘ Hey, man... J‘

28:01.513 --> 28:03.845
(man coughing)

28:04.016 --> 28:05.426
Step to the fence.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.887
What, no turn and cough?

28:13.775 --> 28:16.187
- ( beeps )
- 98.6.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.897
That guy.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.562
( beeps )

28:20.741 --> 28:22.777
101.1.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.782
- Pu|| him.
- The boy's not sick, Melvin.

28:24.953 --> 28:28.241
Orders. Anyone with a fever
goes downstairs.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.872
All right, let's go.
Come on.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.206
- ( grunting ) No, no, no. No, no.
- Hey, relax, buddy.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.631
You found our last transaction
to your liking.

28:38.467 --> 28:39.957
- Nick: I'm not sick.
- Soldier: Here we go.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.966
Yeah, and I'm not giving it back.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.593
Of course not.
A deal's a deal.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.629
But I'm suggesting
an additional transaction.

28:45.807 --> 28:48.219
Something to round out
the ensemble.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.430
Nick: I'm not sick.
I swear, I swear.

28:51.605 --> 28:52.936
Hold.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.642
Easy.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.432
Let me have the boy.
I'll keep an eye on him.

28:57.611 --> 28:59.818
- Hey, hey!
- Take this as collateral.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.898
Where's the other one?

29:06.453 --> 29:08.284
Las Vegas, I think.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.491
- Tragically--
- Yeah, lwant 'em both.

29:10.666 --> 29:11.655
Or no deal.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.164
Man:
What are you doing?

29:13.335 --> 29:16.247
What are you gonna do with us?
Come on!

29:16.421 --> 29:18.127
- Man #2: Get him out of here!
- Nick: Get off of me, man.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.834
Get off of me.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.263
No refunds.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.298
Kid turns, it's your ass.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.593
You think he'll stop there?

29:35.691 --> 29:37.522
"Love always, A."

29:37.693 --> 29:40.480
Oh, that's sweet.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.190
Who's A?

29:43.198 --> 29:44.984
( radio chatter)

29:46.702 --> 29:49.660
( gate buzzes )

29:49.830 --> 29:51.866
Man: Hey, man,
where y'all going to?

29:54.710 --> 29:56.996
Clear, clear!

29:58.880 --> 30:00.541
(snarling )

30:00.716 --> 30:02.877
Here we go,
here we go.

30:07.014 --> 30:08.129
(gunfire)

30:08.307 --> 30:10.343
- Wait, where's Moyers?
- He got held up.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.223
What happened?

30:12.394 --> 30:14.476
He ain't coming.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.557
We'll get you within a few blocks.
Walk home from there.

30:19.735 --> 30:22.397
But Moyers said he'd take me
to the command post, the doctor.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.402
We're not going
near that place, man.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.905
I got a new mission-- operation
get my ass back to San Diego.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.235
( pounding )
Let's go.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.366
(tires squealing )

30:32.372 --> 30:34.658
( Ofelia screaming )

30:40.213 --> 30:42.249
Ofelia.
What--?

30:44.176 --> 30:46.417
Wait, what?
What? Wait.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.117
She was nine years old

31:12.287 --> 31:14.699
when she first asked me
about the war

31:14.873 --> 31:17.364
and why we came to America.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.292
And I told her

31:21.463 --> 31:24.125
in detail

31:24.299 --> 31:27.462
about the violence,

31:27.636 --> 31:29.718
what was done,

31:29.888 --> 31:31.424
how we suffered.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.759
(water running)

31:33.934 --> 31:35.799
I told her everything

31:35.977 --> 31:40.471
except which man
was me.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.942
(voice breaks )
Do you think she will understand...

31:52.411 --> 31:54.948
that it was necessary then...

31:56.456 --> 31:57.992
to survive?

32:01.586 --> 32:04.999
That it is necessary again?

32:28.029 --> 32:30.111
Did he tell us
what we need to know?

32:47.340 --> 32:50.207
( people chattering, crying )

33:00.812 --> 33:03.224
(monitor beeping )

33:04.733 --> 33:06.849
( whispers )
Griselda.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.906
Griselda.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.564
Exnen
She's sedated.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.568
Why don't you trust me?

33:18.747 --> 33:20.829
I told you
she was in recovery.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.580
I want to be here
when she wakes up.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.163
- Liza, she has septic shock.
- ( doorknob rattles )

33:30.675 --> 33:33.712
Sometimes all we can do
isn't enough.

33:35.722 --> 33:38.088
- ( murmuring)
- Griselda.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.437
Where did they go?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.939
Do you wonder
what happened to them?

33:58.870 --> 34:00.906
No.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.798
These are real people.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.628
Built a whole life here.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.769
(sighs)

34:26.940 --> 34:28.771
And now...

34:33.989 --> 34:35.980
( glass shatters )

35:20.285 --> 35:22.276
Ofelia.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.374
Ofelia?

35:34.007 --> 35:36.214
- ( door opens, closes)
- Maddy. Maddy.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.124
Thank God you're okay.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.714
Did you know
what he was gonna do?

35:47.354 --> 35:49.310
You didn't know?

35:50.815 --> 35:53.067
Tell me you didn't know.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.318
Adams: That's when
the screaming started.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.980
It happened so fast.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.820
I'd never seen them
turn that fast before.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.077
All those people,
2,000 of them, just...

36:09.250 --> 36:11.502
trampling each other.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.377
And they couldn't--

36:15.674 --> 36:18.916
they couldn't get out and...

36:19.094 --> 36:22.257
(sighs ) we couldn't tell
the infected from--

36:23.848 --> 36:25.713
oh, God.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.768
I can hear them.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.730
I can still hear them.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.563
- Yeah...
- What did you do?

36:37.737 --> 36:40.570
We locked them in the arena.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.605
l chained the doors.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.616
That's what I did.

36:45.787 --> 36:47.573
I believe you.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.951
( door opens)

36:51.126 --> 36:53.583
- Stop. Stop. Travis, stop.
- Daniel: Hey. Stop, stop.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.209
- Please help.
- Madison: Tell him.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.790
Tell him what you told us.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.580
Tell him about Cobalt.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.558
Daniel:
It's all right.

37:07.726 --> 37:11.389
Cobalt is the command code

37:11.563 --> 37:15.977
to initiate evac
from the LA Basin.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.812
Evac?

37:18.903 --> 37:19.983
When?

37:20.155 --> 37:23.147
When do we leave?

37:23.324 --> 37:25.815
Notyou.
Justus.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.280
- Travis: What?
- Go on.

37:28.455 --> 37:30.821
Our people.
Tell him.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.489
Tell him what
happens to them.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.750
Cobalt includes procedures

37:35.920 --> 37:39.663
for the humane
termination of...

37:42.260 --> 37:44.342
(sighs)

37:49.184 --> 37:51.345
When?

37:51.519 --> 37:53.635
0900 tomorrow.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.364
(gagging)

38:10.538 --> 38:14.122
l was wishing we had something
to mask the smell of urine.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.374
You saved the day.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.208
Why'd you do that?

38:29.724 --> 38:32.340
What you did with the guard,
you saved me.

38:32.519 --> 38:36.353
No, l obligated you.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.184
There's a difference.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.566
The game has changed.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.069
We return to the old rules.

38:47.742 --> 38:50.074
And the people

38:50.245 --> 38:52.031
who won the last round

38:52.205 --> 38:54.070
with their grande lattes

38:54.249 --> 38:56.706
and their frequent flyer miles

38:56.876 --> 39:00.368
are about to become the buffet.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.838
I look at you
and | see someone

39:08.012 --> 39:09.877
who knows the meaning
of necessity.

39:10.056 --> 39:11.557
Well, I'm an addict.

39:11.724 --> 39:15.216
No, you are a heroin addict.

39:15.395 --> 39:18.182
That's the gold standard.
Don't sell yourself short.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.602
The soldiers are leaving.

39:27.615 --> 39:31.949
I'm gonna require a man with your
talents when | make my move.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.038
What move?

40:09.324 --> 40:11.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

40:11.409 --> 40:13.240
They're not patrolling.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.582
Something's wrong.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.840
- ( beeping )
- ( Griselda speaking Spanish )

40:49.197 --> 40:50.482
(speaking Spanish )

40:59.916 --> 41:01.201
Griselda.

41:01.376 --> 41:03.037
What is she saying?

41:03.211 --> 41:06.203
I don't know.
She's not making any sense.

41:06.381 --> 41:09.214
- ( speaking Spanish )
- Es Liza.

41:21.062 --> 41:22.347
Her brain is swelling.

41:22.522 --> 41:25.184
( continues speaking Spanish )

41:48.756 --> 41:51.247
- ( gasping)
-( beeping rapidly)

41:51.426 --> 41:53.041
(flatlining)

42:20.747 --> 42:21.953
What are you doing?

42:22.123 --> 42:23.954
The time varies
from person to person,

42:24.125 --> 42:26.491
but we know that muscle
impulse resumes after death.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.455
Any death.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.587
They all come back.
We all come back.

42:31.758 --> 42:34.249
- ( gas hissing )
- This is a captive bolt pistol.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.461
It's used for livestock.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.799
Traumatic brain injury
is the only thing that stops it.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.966
It's the only way to stop them.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.930
She'll turn, Liza.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.390
- And we don't want her to turn.
- ( gasps) No.

43:07.335 --> 43:09.496
( pistol fires )

43:22.433 --> 43:24.924
(truck approaching )

44:00.179 --> 44:02.465
(banging, growling)

44:04.725 --> 44:06.852
(snarling )

44:28.749 --> 44:31.365
(music playing )
