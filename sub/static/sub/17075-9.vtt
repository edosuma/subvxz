WEBVTT

00:03.023 --> 00:04.122
How's that pressure?

00:04.191 --> 00:05.875
They train us to just
use our fingertips.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.138
Hmm, it's perfect.

00:07.163 --> 00:09.329
It's much better than
the way Mother does it.

00:09.663 --> 00:11.085
That's good to know.

00:11.110 --> 00:12.343
Mmm.

00:12.732 --> 00:14.699
- How's the temperature?
- Good.

00:14.768 --> 00:16.534
Good.

00:16.603 --> 00:18.302
It's getting hot.

00:18.371 --> 00:19.722
I know.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.269
No, seriously, my scalp is burning!

00:21.338 --> 00:24.172
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.308
Here, I-I'll be right back.

00:28.744 --> 00:29.977
Wait. Where's Clive?

00:30.046 --> 00:31.879
You're supposed to bring
him over to my chair, Eileen.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.181
I don't trust myself with him.

00:33.249 --> 00:37.051
It's like I'm angry, but
I'm angry in my pants.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.287
You want to have sex, Eileen.

00:39.355 --> 00:41.122
No, that is not how I do things.

00:41.191 --> 00:43.057
Look, I can control my urges.

00:45.194 --> 00:47.561
Oh, damn him.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.663
He's just so...

00:49.732 --> 00:52.165
sexy all the time.

00:54.102 --> 00:55.469
I need some air.

01:01.710 --> 01:03.176
Alicia Keys might be able

01:03.245 --> 01:04.911
to walk around with no makeup on,

01:04.980 --> 01:06.512
but now that Brett's in the picture,

01:06.581 --> 01:08.581
this diva needs a little help.

01:08.650 --> 01:09.816
Tomorrow,

01:09.885 --> 01:12.964
you are going to look
absolutely stunning.

01:16.339 --> 01:18.023
Brett!

01:20.261 --> 01:21.227
You're here!

01:21.295 --> 01:22.495
Sweet Sissy Spacek.

01:22.564 --> 01:24.671
You have a curler in your hair.

01:24.696 --> 01:26.383
No, I don't.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.258
How did you get in here?

01:28.302 --> 01:30.403
I climbed in your window.

01:30.472 --> 01:33.005
Oh, my God.

01:33.074 --> 01:35.098
Oh, my God! Did my parents see you?

01:35.123 --> 01:36.441
- No, I don't think they were...
- Shh!

01:36.510 --> 01:38.110
These walls are paper-thin.

01:38.179 --> 01:39.245
Hey, Brett!

01:39.313 --> 01:40.346
See?

01:40.414 --> 01:42.248
Okay, I'm sorry. I won't stay long.

01:42.316 --> 01:44.055
I just wanted to see where you live.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.450
Look at this room!

01:45.519 --> 01:49.289
You've got your ribbons and plaques.

01:49.314 --> 01:51.022
What's that? "Perfect Attendance."

01:51.091 --> 01:53.892
Yeah, powered through
shingles to get that one, NBD.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.293
Supposed to get another one this year.

01:55.362 --> 01:57.028
Attendance is kind of my jam.

01:57.097 --> 01:58.730
You know, I usually go for the bad boys,

01:58.799 --> 02:00.399
not the altar boys.

02:00.467 --> 02:02.697
I am not an altar boy.

02:03.771 --> 02:05.470
It's funny... I have never dated

02:05.539 --> 02:07.772
a Secretary General of the Model U.N.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.627
or a Kiwanis Teen of the Week before.

02:10.705 --> 02:13.240
I... I, like, barely won that award.

02:13.308 --> 02:15.697
I didn't even show up to
the ceremony... on time.

02:15.722 --> 02:17.578
Ooh, real rebel.

02:17.646 --> 02:20.047
Yeah, damn right I am.

02:20.115 --> 02:24.485
I have a boy in my room after hours

02:24.552 --> 02:26.220
who I might just kiss.

02:28.054 --> 02:30.424
Mm, hold on. I do not feel good.

02:30.492 --> 02:33.594
I should not have swallowed
that whitening strip.

02:33.848 --> 02:36.116
I got a real funny tummy right now.

02:39.773 --> 02:42.609
Well, we are officially
no longer married.

02:42.634 --> 02:43.654
Mm-hmm.

02:43.679 --> 02:45.999
We should do something special
to, you know, signify it.

02:46.024 --> 02:48.046
Oh, yeah, yeah! Yeah.
Like a fancy handshake.

02:48.071 --> 02:49.638
- Yeah!
- Okay.

02:49.663 --> 02:51.865
Oh. There. Okay.

02:51.890 --> 02:53.647
- Just... good marriage.
- Hey, also with you.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.015
Thank you.

02:55.083 --> 02:56.784
Well, I guess we should
divide up our assets, huh?

02:58.211 --> 02:59.659
Oh, here we go. Uh...

02:59.683 --> 03:02.957
I bequeath to you one
salt and pepper shaker

03:02.973 --> 03:04.394
from Un Poco Mexican Restaurant.

03:04.419 --> 03:06.219
Aww, Pat. Are you sure?

03:06.287 --> 03:07.254
Ah, yeah.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.488
Look, you stole them anyway,

03:08.556 --> 03:10.390
and I was never really
comfortable with it.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.979
And your half of the estate

03:13.004 --> 03:16.062
is a gift certificate for
a free couples massage.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.230
- Oh, hey!
- Huh?

03:17.298 --> 03:19.010
Someday, you can take
some special lady...

03:19.035 --> 03:21.510
Oh, no. It expires tomorrow.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.802
Gloria it is!

03:28.422 --> 03:29.743
Hey, Pat!

03:30.063 --> 03:32.012
Greetings, my lady.

03:32.079 --> 03:35.048
I have come to finally
ask you on a proper date.

03:35.291 --> 03:38.080
Bam! Couples massage.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.502
Has everything a real
date's supposed to have...

03:40.611 --> 03:43.023
hot rocks, aromatherapy,
uncomfortable nudity!

03:43.158 --> 03:44.555
Now's not a good time.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.523
Well, here's the thing, though.

03:46.548 --> 03:49.883
It's kind of got to happen
in the next 16 hours,

03:49.959 --> 03:52.160
because this gift
certificate expires today.

03:52.228 --> 03:53.995
So, why don't I just come on in?

03:54.063 --> 03:55.729
You can finish what you're
doing, and we'll go, okay?

03:55.754 --> 03:58.127
Um, uh... How do I say this?

03:58.152 --> 03:59.458
There's someone here, Pat.

03:59.533 --> 04:00.769
Like a housekeeper?

04:00.837 --> 04:04.181
Yes... but it's a man.

04:04.206 --> 04:05.908
Who I just had sex with.

04:07.267 --> 04:08.620
Oh, wow, okay!

04:08.688 --> 04:09.869
I mean, you moved so slow,

04:09.894 --> 04:12.134
I-I just assumed you weren't interested.

04:12.159 --> 04:14.859
Um, well, this wasn't a romantic thing.

04:14.927 --> 04:16.060
No, no no. This was...

04:16.128 --> 04:18.363
this is couples massage
for a couple of friends,

04:18.430 --> 04:20.498
and I totally expected
you to have somebody here.

04:20.565 --> 04:22.438
I just left a girl at my place.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.220
Yeah. Blair... Underwood.

04:24.245 --> 04:25.937
No relation, but she
gets that all the time.

04:26.005 --> 04:27.038
I'm gonna go.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.803
Brothers from the same
mother! I need your help.

04:31.828 --> 04:34.012
We're supposed to dissect
live frogs in biology today,

04:34.080 --> 04:36.108
but I am starting a petition to stop it.

04:36.133 --> 04:37.549
Man, you're so lucky!

04:37.616 --> 04:40.186
The only thing I got to
dissect was a starfish.

04:40.211 --> 04:41.780
They don't even have vaginas!

04:41.805 --> 04:43.388
Aww, poor Jimmy.

04:43.456 --> 04:45.883
Another thing hiding
its vagina from you.

04:46.743 --> 04:48.293
Since when is this your cause?

04:48.318 --> 04:50.495
There's two things I care
most about in this world...

04:50.563 --> 04:52.664
frogs, and the dismantling
of the Federal Bank.

04:52.732 --> 04:54.612
Okay, well, I'm with
you on the frogs thing.

04:54.637 --> 04:56.426
But I actually have faith
in our banking system.

04:56.451 --> 04:57.669
Then you're a damn fool.

04:57.737 --> 04:59.471
But hand out these petitions for me.

04:59.538 --> 05:01.473
If we get 100 signatures,
they'll cancel the class.

05:01.540 --> 05:03.641
I'll sign it for you
if you draw me a picture

05:03.709 --> 05:05.510
of where a starfish's privates are.

05:05.578 --> 05:08.487
Like, if my hand is a starfish,

05:08.512 --> 05:10.465
where the party be at?

05:10.490 --> 05:11.516
Ow!

05:11.568 --> 05:13.684
Oh, wait. This is Brett.
I have to take this.

05:13.709 --> 05:16.996
Um, but I will get signatures
for you at lunch, okay?

05:20.493 --> 05:21.493
What's up, yo?

05:21.560 --> 05:22.894
Oh, sorry. Wrong number.

05:22.962 --> 05:25.830
Oh, no, no, no. Sorry,
it's me. It's Kenny.

05:25.898 --> 05:27.999
I'm saying a normal hello. Go for Kenny.

05:28.024 --> 05:29.624
Hey, what are you doing right now?

05:29.656 --> 05:31.438
Ah, you know, I'm just at school,

05:31.463 --> 05:33.671
watching these losers get to class.

05:33.739 --> 05:34.873
Yeah, move it, nerd!

05:34.940 --> 05:35.940
I'm so sorry, Lars.

05:36.008 --> 05:37.994
I'll see you at Model U.N. later.

05:38.978 --> 05:40.011
What are you up to?

05:40.079 --> 05:41.978
On Tuesdays, we have a walk-away lunch,

05:42.003 --> 05:44.415
and, uh, I'd like to walk away with you.

05:44.483 --> 05:46.084
Uh, you want to come?

05:46.152 --> 05:48.620
I actually... I don't
have a walk-away lunch.

05:48.687 --> 05:50.522
Oh, okay, well, I don't want you

05:50.589 --> 05:52.056
to get in trouble or anything.

05:52.124 --> 05:53.258
So, how 'bout later, then?

05:53.325 --> 05:55.372
A-are you kidding? I love trouble.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.793
Trouble, actually, is not just the name

05:56.818 --> 05:58.129
of a board game I excel at.

05:58.197 --> 05:59.895
It's also a word...

05:59.920 --> 06:02.803
to describe something
I like to get into.

06:02.828 --> 06:04.873
Right?

06:04.898 --> 06:07.272
Um, so, in summary, you and me, lunch...

06:07.339 --> 06:08.439
it's happening.

06:09.708 --> 06:13.318
- Oh! Eileen!
- Well, what a nice surprise.

06:13.343 --> 06:14.579
Um, what brings you by?

06:14.647 --> 06:17.248
Well, I just thought I'd drop by,

06:17.316 --> 06:19.317
bring some lunch, say hi,

06:19.385 --> 06:22.555
and mention that my divorce
from Pat is now final.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.808
- Oh.
- As of today,

06:24.832 --> 06:26.648
I am no longer a married woman.

06:26.673 --> 06:29.430
I am so pleased for you.

06:29.455 --> 06:30.647
How's Pat taking it?

06:30.672 --> 06:32.206
He's such a sensitive guy.

06:32.231 --> 06:34.632
He has sad eyes. Did
you ever notice that?

06:34.700 --> 06:36.601
Clive, I don't think you understand.

06:36.669 --> 06:39.804
I can now do things
that unmarried women do.

06:39.872 --> 06:42.640
Things that married
women can't do, right?

06:42.708 --> 06:45.410
Like file an individual tax return

06:45.477 --> 06:49.180
or have intimate relations
with another consenting adult

06:49.248 --> 06:50.448
who is also not married?

06:52.418 --> 06:53.599
Oh!

06:53.624 --> 06:55.253
Mm, yes.

06:57.141 --> 06:59.974
Well, I'm not sure
what's about to go down,

06:59.999 --> 07:02.694
but this has the potential to
be the most significant moment

07:02.761 --> 07:05.129
I've ever experienced in
the vice principal's office,

07:05.197 --> 07:08.967
so I would just like to make
the mood a little more special.

07:09.034 --> 07:10.535
Okay.

07:14.106 --> 07:15.373
Yeah.

07:15.441 --> 07:16.507
Oh.

07:16.575 --> 07:17.650
Well...

07:18.501 --> 07:19.713
well...

07:19.738 --> 07:21.228
The lighting is romantic,

07:21.253 --> 07:23.603
but the mist also helps with my sinuses.

07:23.628 --> 07:24.571
Oh.

07:24.596 --> 07:26.284
Have I told you I
have a deviated septum?

07:26.309 --> 07:28.282
Let's not talk about that.

07:29.406 --> 07:31.907
Clive, I need a pep talk.

07:31.932 --> 07:33.266
Oh.

07:33.525 --> 07:35.493
I see this is a bad time.

07:35.561 --> 07:37.028
Eileen just told me
about the divorce papers.

07:37.096 --> 07:37.996
How you doing, buddy?

07:38.063 --> 07:40.365
Oh, I'm good. I'm...

07:40.432 --> 07:41.833
I'm just gonna go see a movie.

07:41.901 --> 07:43.534
Something with, uh...

07:43.602 --> 07:45.069
Blair Underwood.

07:45.137 --> 07:46.885
What is my problem?

07:47.806 --> 07:48.673
He'll be okay, right?

07:48.741 --> 07:49.974
Yeah, until he finds out

07:50.042 --> 07:52.825
Blair Underwood's really
more of a TV actor.

07:54.194 --> 07:55.380
Aah!

07:55.405 --> 07:56.425
Aah!

07:56.450 --> 07:58.261
Crap, it's the candles!

07:58.286 --> 07:59.550
Why is that alarm so sensitive?

07:59.618 --> 08:01.380
It's just a big wooden
building full of children!

08:01.405 --> 08:02.880
Well, what should we do?

08:02.903 --> 08:05.204
We got to go out to the
blacktop, take attendance.

08:05.273 --> 08:07.474
Wha... we could just
head over to my place.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.278
Let them burn!

08:11.118 --> 08:13.633
I'm not sure if this
is inappropriate, but...

08:14.774 --> 08:18.016
you look a little tense, and I
think a massage could help us both.

08:18.048 --> 08:19.672
Oh, you know what? Never
mind. Peace be with you.

08:19.735 --> 08:20.825
Jimmy!

08:20.830 --> 08:21.860
Hey!

08:21.885 --> 08:23.648
How'd you like to grab a couples massage

08:23.673 --> 08:24.707
with the old man?

08:24.775 --> 08:26.842
Leave school in the middle of the day?

08:26.892 --> 08:28.926
And miss my math quiz?

08:29.011 --> 08:30.612
- I'm in.
- Oh, wait, if there's a math quiz...

08:30.679 --> 08:31.876
No take-backs!

08:33.477 --> 08:35.586
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh!

08:35.611 --> 08:38.620
I raced home to pick something up.

08:38.687 --> 08:41.491
Oh. Oh, Clive.

08:41.515 --> 08:44.063
It's our first time. Can't
we just keep it simple?

08:44.087 --> 08:46.227
Oh, simple's the only
way I know how to do it.

08:46.295 --> 08:49.030
I just thought these sensual oils

08:49.098 --> 08:50.976
might be nice to just relax us.

08:51.001 --> 08:53.201
Yeah, well, we don't
need to relax, right?

08:53.269 --> 08:56.493
We're two consenting
adults in an empty house.

08:56.518 --> 08:58.306
And, by the way, the
mailman already came,

08:58.374 --> 08:59.607
so we won't be interrupted.

08:59.675 --> 09:01.543
- Eileen O'Neal?
- Yeah.

09:01.610 --> 09:02.954
Give me your forearm.

09:05.555 --> 09:07.925
Ooh, that's nice!

09:07.950 --> 09:10.425
I only use oil to cook.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.917
- Right.
- But...

09:11.942 --> 09:13.321
this is nice. It's kind of warm.

09:13.389 --> 09:14.613
- Is that right?
- Feel this.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.495
Oh, okay.

09:16.511 --> 09:17.544
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

09:17.612 --> 09:19.480
Yeah, little bit of a tickle there.

09:19.547 --> 09:20.781
Yeah.

09:20.849 --> 09:22.339
- Um...
- Wow.

09:22.378 --> 09:24.485
It is heating up there, huh?

09:24.552 --> 09:26.034
- It sure is.
- Whew.

09:26.855 --> 09:28.288
Aah! No!

09:28.356 --> 09:29.448
Now my forehead's on fire.

09:29.473 --> 09:31.696
Aah! It's like a thousand knives!

09:31.721 --> 09:33.394
Get it off! Get it off!

09:33.461 --> 09:35.462
How old are these stupid oils?

09:35.530 --> 09:37.798
I got them as a gag gift at a Y2K party.

09:37.866 --> 09:40.167
It's crazy we're still alive
to use them, though, huh?

09:40.235 --> 09:41.835
- It burns, it burns!
- Ow!

09:41.903 --> 09:44.505
I need to prove to
Brett that I'm a bad boy,

09:44.572 --> 09:45.906
but how?

09:45.974 --> 09:48.742
So, tell me about your
exes. What were they like?

09:48.810 --> 09:50.944
- I don't want to talk about them.
- Come on.

09:51.012 --> 09:53.313
This car is a safe space.

09:53.381 --> 09:54.548
I mean, not physically,

09:54.616 --> 09:56.650
because your oil light
is on, but emotionally.

09:56.718 --> 09:58.285
Come on, just tell me about one of them.

09:58.353 --> 10:00.788
Did you, like, cut school and eat lunch?

10:00.855 --> 10:02.523
Is that, like, your go-to move?

10:02.590 --> 10:03.824
Sometimes, okay?

10:03.892 --> 10:06.494
But we didn't eat in the
car. He had a motorcycle.

10:06.519 --> 10:08.319
Mm, that's cool.

10:08.417 --> 10:11.498
I'm actually trained in
stage combat and unicycling.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.858
That's not nothing.

10:13.883 --> 10:16.437
Oh, crap, five minutes
to get back to class.

10:16.504 --> 10:18.172
Does that mean you have
to get back to class?

10:18.239 --> 10:20.253
What? No, that's just a
text from my drug dealer.

10:20.278 --> 10:21.378
What?!

10:21.403 --> 10:22.948
Oh, God, I've gone too far.

10:22.973 --> 10:24.311
I'm just kidding. Um...

10:24.379 --> 10:28.948
that is an alarm to tell
me to do something crazy.

10:28.973 --> 10:31.216
What is something crazy that
you've always wanted to do?

10:31.262 --> 10:32.686
Um... okay.

10:32.754 --> 10:34.317
This is gonna sound really lame,

10:34.342 --> 10:37.581
but I have always
wanted to get a tattoo.

10:37.606 --> 10:40.627
Me, too! I've always
wanted to get a tattoo.

10:40.695 --> 10:42.696
No, I haven't! don't want a tattoo!

10:42.764 --> 10:44.031
Let's do it now.

10:44.099 --> 10:46.867
Why can't I stop my big stupid mouth?

10:46.935 --> 10:49.870
It's a little weird that
Gloria had somebody over, right?

10:49.938 --> 10:51.875
I mean, who has sex when it's light out

10:51.900 --> 10:53.707
and you can see each other?

10:53.775 --> 10:56.410
I tell you, people do the
strangest things sometimes.

10:56.478 --> 10:58.111
I hear you, Dad.

10:58.136 --> 10:59.546
Is this good?

10:59.614 --> 11:01.215
I could use a little more pressure.

11:01.299 --> 11:02.805
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

11:04.025 --> 11:05.609
- To be fair, though,
- Mm-hmm.

11:05.634 --> 11:08.388
you and Gloria never
really dated, right?

11:08.456 --> 11:10.844
Well, no, not really. But...

11:10.869 --> 11:13.827
we had a lot of potential, you know?

11:13.895 --> 11:15.729
It was all ahead of us.

11:15.797 --> 11:19.500
Mm! Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

11:19.567 --> 11:22.174
Why are you two massaging each other?

11:22.437 --> 11:24.671
Damn it, Jimmy! I told you
that's not how this works!

11:24.739 --> 11:26.974
I... I...

11:27.538 --> 11:30.172
Thank God this calamine
lotion's flesh-colored.

11:30.197 --> 11:31.211
It just blends right in.

11:31.279 --> 11:32.246
Yeah.

11:32.313 --> 11:33.213
Oh.

11:33.281 --> 11:34.581
All right.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.688
Third time's the charm.

11:36.713 --> 11:38.102
Oh.

11:38.127 --> 11:39.253
Yep.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.791
Yep.

11:42.857 --> 11:45.092
That's, uh... that's Pat's side.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.760
Oh, right.

11:47.009 --> 11:49.129
That's... that's my side.

11:49.197 --> 11:51.322
Oh, um...

11:51.633 --> 11:52.908
You know, let's just...

11:52.933 --> 11:54.549
Why don't we try the bench?

11:54.936 --> 11:56.336
Okay.

11:59.974 --> 12:02.211
Sorry, I just...

12:03.219 --> 12:05.882
There hasn't been any
other man in this bed

12:05.907 --> 12:08.148
besides Pat for 18 years.

12:08.207 --> 12:09.538
Oh, well,

12:09.572 --> 12:11.952
you should really change
your mattress every 10 years,

12:12.020 --> 12:14.221
as is recommended by the manufacturer.

12:14.289 --> 12:15.756
Oh, really?

12:15.824 --> 12:17.491
Huh.

12:17.559 --> 12:19.912
Maybe I should get one of those, um...

12:20.829 --> 12:22.229
memory-foam mattresses.

12:22.297 --> 12:25.666
Oh, yeah, I would definitely
recommend memory foam.

12:25.733 --> 12:29.837
Or latex. It's heavy, but it's durable.

12:30.248 --> 12:31.772
You really know a lot about mattresses.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.040
I just bought one for myself.

12:33.107 --> 12:36.012
I recommend Raffi. He's
over at Mattress Planet.

12:39.180 --> 12:40.551
It's the school.

12:41.549 --> 12:42.783
Hello?

12:42.851 --> 12:44.184
Oh, okay.

12:44.252 --> 12:46.629
I'll be right there.

12:46.654 --> 12:49.089
What is it? What happened?

12:49.157 --> 12:50.757
Whoa!

12:52.760 --> 12:54.677
Have you decided yet?

12:55.697 --> 12:56.864
You know, I'm just gonna spin around

12:56.931 --> 12:58.699
and point at the wall,
and whatever I point at,

12:58.766 --> 12:59.867
that's what I'm gonna get.

12:59.934 --> 13:00.901
That's badass.

13:00.969 --> 13:02.703
Damn right it is.

13:04.606 --> 13:05.888
Okay.

13:11.919 --> 13:13.981
"RIP Kevin" it is.

13:14.048 --> 13:15.449
You sure?

13:15.516 --> 13:18.206
Kevins die every day, man.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.517
I'll know one eventually.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.110
I feel like you might
be trying to impress him.

13:26.427 --> 13:27.628
This is permanent.

13:27.695 --> 13:29.663
I know. I'm good.

13:29.841 --> 13:30.874
All right.

13:33.287 --> 13:34.668
You look pale, Kenny.

13:34.736 --> 13:36.638
I'm always pale when I'm fired up!

13:38.573 --> 13:39.873
Okay.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.541
This may hurt...

13:41.609 --> 13:42.826
a lot.

13:50.572 --> 13:53.153
Wow, your elbows feel so good.

13:53.525 --> 13:55.889
Much better than Jimmy's.

13:55.957 --> 13:57.491
How you doing over there, son?

13:57.558 --> 13:59.411
Oh, yeah.

13:59.544 --> 14:02.663
Just two naked dudes hanging out.

14:02.730 --> 14:05.333
Naked? I'm not naked.

14:05.566 --> 14:07.100
It's actually been a really long time

14:07.168 --> 14:08.435
since a woman's touched me,

14:08.503 --> 14:10.904
and so I'm wearing boxers and briefs

14:10.972 --> 14:13.573
just in case, you know,
the circus comes to town.

14:13.641 --> 14:15.645
We should have just let
them massage each other.

14:15.670 --> 14:16.732
You know...

14:18.005 --> 14:20.681
I sure am glad you're here
with me instead of Gloria.

14:20.748 --> 14:22.980
- Yeah, she would've ruined this.
- Hmm.

14:23.005 --> 14:25.085
And I'm glad at the fact
that she's having day sex

14:25.153 --> 14:28.160
with some random dude
isn't getting you down.

14:28.185 --> 14:30.558
Yeah, I'd almost forgotten about it.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.903
Your life is pretty
sweet right now, Dad.

14:33.139 --> 14:36.074
You got all this freedom
because your marriage is over.

14:36.317 --> 14:37.753
It sure is.

14:37.778 --> 14:39.544
And you're starting a new life

14:39.569 --> 14:42.148
in your own 200-square-foot house.

14:42.216 --> 14:43.717
It's 190.

14:43.784 --> 14:45.352
And you don't have to listen to anyone

14:45.419 --> 14:46.724
or do anything you don't want to,

14:46.794 --> 14:48.261
because you are all alone!

14:48.329 --> 14:50.797
Yes, okay. I get it!
I'm all alone, all right?

14:50.866 --> 14:52.133
I live in a garage.

14:52.201 --> 14:54.068
I just got dumped by a
girl I'm not even dating.

14:54.136 --> 14:55.970
Your mother's lover is my best friend.

14:56.038 --> 14:59.656
And despite all this underwear,
the circus is in town!

14:59.681 --> 15:01.075
What is going on?

15:01.143 --> 15:02.977
I hate these kids.

15:03.045 --> 15:06.280
One of the little monsters let
the frogs out of the biology lab.

15:06.348 --> 15:07.248
What...

15:07.316 --> 15:08.616
Oh, my God.

15:08.684 --> 15:10.451
Do you see what's happening?

15:10.519 --> 15:12.750
First, it was the fire
with the smoke alarm.

15:12.775 --> 15:14.922
Then it was the boils with the sex oil,

15:14.990 --> 15:17.515
and now frogs!

15:17.554 --> 15:19.092
What are you talking about?

15:19.117 --> 15:20.762
Plagues. It's a sign.

15:20.829 --> 15:23.498
God is punishing me for my lustful ways.

15:23.565 --> 15:25.933
He sent plagues at every
turn just to stop me.

15:26.001 --> 15:27.301
I'm sorry, Clive,

15:27.369 --> 15:30.498
but God is telling me
that I shouldn't do this.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.609
I don't know what other
plagues he's gonna send.

15:33.903 --> 15:36.271
I mean, I could handle cattle disease.

15:36.296 --> 15:37.929
A sea of blood?

15:38.712 --> 15:40.492
It's just not worth it.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.646
Are you feeling better?

15:47.714 --> 15:49.048
I guess.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.083
Did I do it?

15:51.151 --> 15:54.329
Oh, my God, I did it! I'm tuh-tooed!

15:54.500 --> 15:56.376
You sure are, killer.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.829
Wait, where is it? All
I see is this freckle.

16:01.854 --> 16:03.195
No, that's it.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.264
When the needle hit
your arm, you passed out.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.832
Legally, I had to stop.

16:07.292 --> 16:08.931
I fainted?

16:08.956 --> 16:10.869
Like a lady?

16:12.772 --> 16:15.207
- Hey, where's my friend?
- He left.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.443
I knew it.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.244
I knew this relationship wouldn't last.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.412
God, I'm such an idiot.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.354
I was trying to be
cool, but I'm not cool.

16:22.589 --> 16:24.216
Nah, it's not the first word

16:24.284 --> 16:26.852
that I would use to describe you.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.729
So, what's going on, Dad?

16:28.754 --> 16:31.610
Well, I thought that I
was upset about Gloria,

16:31.635 --> 16:33.625
but that doesn't make any sense

16:33.693 --> 16:35.127
because we weren't
even in a relationship,

16:35.195 --> 16:37.047
so I didn't lose anything.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.204
I think what I'm upset about

16:39.229 --> 16:41.567
is just the thought of being alone.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.036
Dad, a man alone is a bachelor.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.038
The world is your oyster.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.974
Y-you could... you could
have sex with twins,

16:49.042 --> 16:50.876
or you could buy a crossbow.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.144
I've always wanted a crossbow.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.712
And when you're not doing those things,

16:53.780 --> 16:56.215
you have me and Kenny and Shannon.

16:56.455 --> 16:58.617
No matter what, we're always
gonna be there for you.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.748
But I should spend more time by myself.

17:00.773 --> 17:03.779
I mean, I need to be comfortable with...

17:03.804 --> 17:05.848
well, me.

17:05.874 --> 17:08.227
I know you're gonna love it, Dad.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.229
Just based on today, I can say

17:10.296 --> 17:13.065
that being with you is pretty awesome.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.932
I couldn't keep my hands off you.

17:14.957 --> 17:16.782
And when you're done being by yourself,

17:16.808 --> 17:18.596
there is no limit to the amount of women

17:18.621 --> 17:20.271
you're gonna have in your tiny house.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.574
Well, there is actually a
limit, 'cause I spaced it out.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.942
It's like five.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.310
It's that with two in the loft?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.512
Yeah.

17:28.207 --> 17:29.848
Oh, hey!

17:29.916 --> 17:31.183
Kenny, hey.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.518
There you are.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.752
Oh, my God, did you come here

17:33.820 --> 17:34.902
to break up with me to my face?

17:34.927 --> 17:36.321
Okay, well, let me make it easy for you.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.457
I know that you date bad boys,

17:37.505 --> 17:38.996
and you enter houses
in unconventional ways,

17:39.021 --> 17:40.993
but I'm Kenny O'Neal.
I'm a front-door man.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.808
That sounded really sexual.
Okay, what I meant to say is,

17:42.833 --> 17:44.572
I am not a bad boy, and I never will be.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.931
So, I accept your resignation.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.166
Do you want to take a breath?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.511
Yes.

17:49.097 --> 17:50.302
Okay, relax.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.370
I'm not here to break up with you.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.205
I left to get you a Gatorade,

17:53.273 --> 17:54.940
and then, when I came
back, you were gone.

17:54.977 --> 17:57.612
That is so sweet.

17:57.637 --> 17:59.445
I-I don't want some bad guy, okay?

17:59.512 --> 18:02.214
They're awful, and sometimes
they steal your leather jacket.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.549
Really?

18:03.574 --> 18:04.640
Really.

18:05.188 --> 18:07.286
Well, what kind of guy do you want?

18:07.353 --> 18:09.031
Maybe a guy whose bangs

18:09.056 --> 18:10.389
were curled with an old-lady curler?

18:10.457 --> 18:12.125
I bought that in the
men's section at Sephora.

18:12.150 --> 18:15.320
Relax, okay? I think good guys are hot.

18:15.383 --> 18:16.795
Yeah?

18:16.863 --> 18:17.921
Well, this morning,

18:17.946 --> 18:19.407
I brought up my neighbor's trash cans

18:19.432 --> 18:20.666
because they have Alzheimer's.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.601
Keep talking.

18:21.626 --> 18:23.735
I put change in other people's meters,

18:23.786 --> 18:25.882
and sometimes, I slip
an encouraging note

18:25.907 --> 18:27.041
in my brother's lunch.

18:27.066 --> 18:28.500
I want to kiss you.

18:28.525 --> 18:31.052
Hey! You screwed me, Kenny.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.811
You were supposed to get
me signatures at lunch,

18:32.879 --> 18:34.012
but you weren't even here.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.547
So, I had take matters
into my own hands,

18:35.615 --> 18:37.349
and I released all the frogs.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.551
Shannon O'Neal, I
need to speak with you!

18:39.626 --> 18:41.757
You'll never take me alive!

18:42.515 --> 18:44.423
Everything's gonna be fine, Brett.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.225
You just try to control yourself

18:46.292 --> 18:47.860
while this good guy gets to work.

18:48.092 --> 18:49.928
Mrs. Velzey, hi.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.830
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.225
Shannon wasn't the one
who released the frogs.

18:54.288 --> 18:55.334
It was me.

18:55.401 --> 18:56.902
I find that hard to believe.

18:56.970 --> 19:01.273
Oh, well, maybe this tuh-too
will change your mind.

19:01.544 --> 19:02.685
That tiny freckle?

19:02.710 --> 19:04.877
Okay, moving on. I
am the one who did it.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.849
Any punishment you were
gonna give to Shannon

19:06.874 --> 19:08.614
I will now bear the brunt of.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.075
Two days suspension.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.067
Yeah, no. It was Shannon.
She went that way.

19:13.509 --> 19:15.970
I'm sorry, but I want
another attendance plaque.

19:18.424 --> 19:19.691
Hello, Clive.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.735
- May I come in?
- You know you may.

19:24.923 --> 19:28.400
Eileen, I can totally
understand how you could see

19:28.468 --> 19:31.236
the fire and the boils
and the frogs as plagues.

19:31.275 --> 19:33.127
As I say it now,
- that's all I can think of, too.

19:33.152 --> 19:34.873
Yes, that's why I had to bring

19:34.941 --> 19:36.475
my big Mary up from the basement.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.275
Big Mary? What was Kenny
doing in the basement?

19:40.170 --> 19:40.979
Oh!

19:42.382 --> 19:45.061
That Mary. She is lifelike.

19:45.086 --> 19:47.428
May we speak privately?

19:50.490 --> 19:51.657
Look, whatever you say,

19:51.724 --> 19:53.425
I am not going to
have sex with you here.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.861
Good, because I don't want to
have sex with you here, either.

19:56.886 --> 19:59.774
Eileen, those signs,
they weren't plagues.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.966
They were miracles,

20:01.034 --> 20:03.435
because they stopped us
from making our first time

20:03.503 --> 20:04.836
something not special.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.744
We were trying to do it
in all the wrong places.

20:07.769 --> 20:10.509
Yeah, I guess I really
would have regretted it

20:10.577 --> 20:12.110
if we had had sex in your office

20:12.178 --> 20:13.478
five feet from my kid's homeroom.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.416
Yeah, or your living
room or your marital bed.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.854
God wasn't saying, "Shame on you."

20:19.879 --> 20:21.820
He was saying, "Get a room."

20:21.888 --> 20:23.639
In fact, he said...

20:23.923 --> 20:24.923
"Get a suite."

20:26.326 --> 20:28.202
It's a Courtyard by Marriott.

20:29.438 --> 20:31.330
Please tell me it's
the one by the airport.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.531
You know it is.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.334
We can watch the planes
take off all night long.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.032
Again and again and again.

20:37.057 --> 20:39.265
Or just one solid takeoff.

20:39.290 --> 20:40.343
Okay.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.375
We should get room service, eh?

20:43.443 --> 20:45.828
Well, there is a
breakfast buffet included.

20:46.406 --> 20:47.922
Bye, Mom, I'm going to school.

20:48.266 --> 20:49.672
What is that on your arm?

20:50.375 --> 20:51.648
Thi... Nothing?

20:51.673 --> 20:53.010
Come here.

20:58.485 --> 21:00.486
Is that a tuh-too?

21:00.554 --> 21:02.250
No, it's a freckle.

21:02.275 --> 21:03.998
I know every inch of your body,

21:04.023 --> 21:06.045
and you have never had a freckle there.

21:06.070 --> 21:07.093
Sunspot?

21:07.161 --> 21:09.595
You don't tan. You burn... in hell

21:09.663 --> 21:11.211
if you don't look at Mary

21:11.236 --> 21:14.271
and tell me that that is fresh ink.

21:15.903 --> 21:17.470
Oh, God!

21:17.538 --> 21:20.206
She's always bigger than you remember.
