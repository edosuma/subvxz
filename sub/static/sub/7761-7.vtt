- * ONE, TWO, THREE,

00:12.346 --> 00:13.647
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

* CUE THE PULSE

01:27.921 --> 01:30.191
- I SUSPECT IT'S A SEMINOMA,

01:30.224 --> 01:33.661
A FORM OF TESTICULAR CANCER
QUITE COMMON IN MEN YOUR AGE.

01:33.694 --> 01:37.231
HOWEVER, WE CAN'T BE SURE
UNTIL WE PERFORM A BIOPSY.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.599
- HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

01:38.632 --> 01:43.604
- FIRST, WE HAVE
TO REMOVE THE TESTICLE.

01:43.637 --> 01:48.476
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY.

01:48.509 --> 01:52.613
AND IF I DON'T
HAVE CANCER, THEN...

01:52.646 --> 01:54.882
DO YOU PUT IT BACK IN?

01:54.915 --> 01:57.151
- UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.787
- I WAS AFRAID YOU WERE
GOING TO SAY THAT TOO.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.755
- HOWEVER THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

02:01.789 --> 02:03.257
THE PROCEDURE
IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.426
AS FOR THE OTHER TESTE,

02:05.459 --> 02:08.229
IT WILL STILL BE
COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL,

02:08.262 --> 02:09.497
AND NEITHER
YOUR SEXUAL PERFORMANCE

02:09.530 --> 02:11.365
NOR YOUR FERTILITY
WILL BE AFFECTED.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.401
- THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.668
I'LL BE A ONE-BALL WONDER.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.170
- AH, NO, NO, NO.

02:16.204 --> 02:19.807
WE GIVE YOU
A PROSTHETIC REPLACEMENT.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.244
HERE.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.646
HELP YOURSELF.

02:25.679 --> 02:30.551
- SOMETIMES YOU FEEL LIKE
A NUT, SOMETIMES YOU DON'T.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.287
- THEY ALL LOOK AND FEEL
COMPLETELY NATURAL.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.723
OF COURSE WE TRY TO MATCH
YOUR ORIGINAL TESTICLE

02:35.756 --> 02:38.392
AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.928
- NOT TOO BIG,
NOT TOO SMALL, BUT...

02:40.961 --> 02:43.264
JUST RIGHT.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.734
[sighs]

02:51.472 --> 02:53.541
SO WHAT ARE MY CHANCES?

02:53.574 --> 02:57.545
- WITH SURGERY AND FOLLOW-UP
PROCEDURE, 99%.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.748
NOT BAD.

03:00.781 --> 03:04.552
- AND WITHOUT SURGERY?

03:04.585 --> 03:06.554
- THE CANCER WILL SPREAD
THROUGH YOUR BODY.

03:06.587 --> 03:10.524
IT WILL INVADE YOUR VITAL
ORGANS, AND YOU WILL DIE.

03:15.496 --> 03:19.433
- THIS ONE YEAR OF CLARITY
HAS MEANT MORE TO ME

03:19.467 --> 03:23.571
THAN ALL MY OTHER 40 YEARS
OF PAIN AND CONFUSION.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.374
AND FOR THAT,
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK

03:26.407 --> 03:29.710
THE PERSON WHO HELPED
GET ME HERE,

03:29.743 --> 03:32.313
SOMETIMES HAD TO DRAG ME HERE.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.748
MY SPONSOR BLAKE.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.751
BLAKE HAS BEEN MY ROCK.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.354
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WOULD'VE DONE WITHOUT HIM.

03:40.388 --> 03:43.757
BLAKE, I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE
WITH MORE INTEGRITY THAN YOU.

03:43.791 --> 03:47.728
THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE
FOR ME, FOR BEING MY FRIEND,

03:47.761 --> 03:49.897
FOR BELIEVING IN ME.

03:49.930 --> 03:53.367
[applause]

04:02.376 --> 04:05.279
- SHOULD I GO UP AND GET HER?

04:05.313 --> 04:08.349
- GIVE HER
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.917
- SHE WAS UP
MOST OF THE NIGHT.

04:09.950 --> 04:13.020
I HEARD HER RATTLING AROUND
IN THE KITCHEN.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.356
- THAT CAN'T BE A GOOD SIGN.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.490
- THEN THIS MORNING
SHE WAS PACING

04:16.524 --> 04:17.625
BACK AND FORTH
IN HER ROOM.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.628
- LIKE MARY TYRONE?
- WHO?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.029
- DIDN'T ANY OF YOU
ILLITERATES EVER READ

04:22.062 --> 04:23.631
LONG DAY'S JOURNEY
INTO NIGHT?

04:23.664 --> 04:26.367
- PART OF THE TENTH GRADE
ENGLISH CURRICULUM.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.636
- COMPARED TO SOME
OF THE FOSTER HOMES I WAS IN,

04:28.669 --> 04:30.070
IT'S THE FUCKING
BRADY BUNCH.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.906
- WOULD YOU SHOW
A LITTLE RESPECT?

04:32.940 --> 04:33.974
SIT DOWN.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.376
- MICHAEL.

04:35.409 --> 04:39.413
- IT'S MY UNCLE'S FUNERAL.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.048
IF SHE DOESN'T GET
HER ASS DOWN HERE IN...

04:41.081 --> 04:42.650
TWO MINUTES,
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

04:42.683 --> 04:46.820
- LIKE THE GUY'S
GOING TO GIVE A SHIT.

04:53.026 --> 04:56.397
- NOT SURE
SHE'S UP FOR THIS.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.432
- THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.867
- SHE WOULDN'T MISS
HIS FUNERAL.

04:59.900 --> 05:04.438
- WHO KNOWS,
AFTER THE FIGHT THEY HAD?

05:08.709 --> 05:10.944
I'D BETTER GO GET HER.
- IF YOU NEED HELP, JUST HOLLER.

05:10.978 --> 05:16.850
I'M A MARVEL WITH MADWOMEN.
[chuckles]

05:16.884 --> 05:20.488
- WHY IS EVERYBODY
SITTING AROUND?

05:23.791 --> 05:25.759
MICHAEL, ARE THE CAR
AND DRIVER HERE?

05:25.793 --> 05:27.495
THEY'RE OUT FRONT.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.797
- THEN LET'S GO.

05:39.607 --> 05:43.844
- BEFORE WE CONSIGN OUR BROTHER
VICTOR ANTONIO GRASSI

05:43.877 --> 05:46.614
TO THE ARMS OF
OUR LOVING AND BENEVOLENT GOD,

05:46.647 --> 05:51.351
IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE
TO OFFER A PERSONAL REMEMBRANCE?

06:04.565 --> 06:08.035
- THIS IS SO HARD.

06:10.838 --> 06:14.775
[clears throat]
WHERE DO I START?

06:16.910 --> 06:21.882
MY UNCLE VIC WAS THE FIRST
PERSON I EVER TOLD I WAS GAY.

06:21.915 --> 06:25.419
HE LAUGHED AND SAID,

06:25.453 --> 06:27.020
"THANK GOD,
NOW YOUR GRANDMOTHER WILL HAVE

06:27.054 --> 06:31.492
SOMEONE ELSE'S SOUL
TO PRAY FOR."

06:31.525 --> 06:33.961
THAT'S HOW HE WAS.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.798
NEVER SENTIMENTAL, UNLIKE ME.

06:40.734 --> 06:45.506
ALWAYS FACING ADVERSITY
WITH A SMILE AND...

06:45.539 --> 06:47.508
A CYNICAL REMARK.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.510
I'M SURE IF HE SAW US
HERE TODAY HE'D SAY,

06:49.543 --> 06:50.811
"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
WASTING YOUR TIME

06:50.844 --> 06:54.214
ON A DEAD MAN FOR?
GO GET LAID."

06:54.247 --> 06:58.185
[laughter]

06:58.218 --> 07:03.190
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY
THANK YOU, UNCLE VIC...

07:03.223 --> 07:08.195
FOR EVERYTHING YOU TAUGHT ME.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.098
YOU WERE A BRAVE MAN,

07:11.131 --> 07:15.669
A GOOD MAN.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.706
WHICH IS ALL WE CAN
EVER HOPE TO BE.

07:22.910 --> 07:27.715
- ANYONE ELSE?

07:27.748 --> 07:30.884
- HE MADE A FUCKING FABULOUS

07:30.918 --> 07:32.986
TARTE AUX POMMES
WITH CREME FRAICHE.

07:33.020 --> 07:38.892
[laughter]

07:38.926 --> 07:40.994
- HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON
I KNEW

07:41.028 --> 07:43.964
WHO LOOKED GOOD
IN A HAWAIIAN SHIRT.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.133
WELL, ALMOST.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.772
- HE ONCE DID COKE
WITH LIZA AT STUDIO 54.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.240
[chuckles]

07:53.273 --> 07:58.612
- HE WAS GAY
BEFORE IT WAS FASHIONABLE.

07:58.646 --> 08:03.116
- I NEVER HEARD HIM COMPLAIN,
NOT ONCE.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.787
HE LIVED IN GRATITUDE.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.831
- MA?

08:30.811 --> 08:32.179
- I THINK YOUR UNCLE'S
HEARD MORE THAN ENOUGH

08:32.212 --> 08:35.749
OF WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

08:35.783 --> 08:39.653
- IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO PLACE YOUR ROSES...

09:05.946 --> 09:08.081
- [sighs]

09:10.083 --> 09:12.052
- YOU HOLDING UP OKAY?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.921
- WHY, DO I LOOK LIKE
I'M FALLING APART?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.689
- NO, YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.090
- I JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO
THE HOUSE BEFORE THE OTHERS DO.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.827
I WAS UP HALF THE NIGHT
PREPARING FOOD.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.995
- THERE ARE BOXES
WE STILL HADN'T UNPACKED.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.665
HE SAID, "WHAT'S THE HURRY?"

09:24.698 --> 09:25.966
- WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN

09:25.999 --> 09:28.669
WHEN THEY SAY,
"APPRECIATE EVERY MINUTE."

09:28.702 --> 09:33.674
THAT'S HARD TO DO
WHEN THEY GO BY SO FAST.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.376
- IT'S BEEN SO LONG
SINCE ANYONE WE KNOW HAS DIED.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.345
- I GUESS WE'VE BEEN
LULLED INTO COMPLACENCY

09:38.378 --> 09:39.680
BY ALL THE NEW DRUGS.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.749
- [sighs]

09:41.782 --> 09:43.216
- YOU OKAY, PAL?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.719
- YEAH. SURE.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.287
- ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT IT'S BETTER

09:47.320 --> 09:50.691
TO GO OUT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY,

09:50.724 --> 09:53.694
THAN TO END UP
SOME DISEASED, OLD QUEEN.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.296
- YOU MIGHT FEEL DIFFERENTLY
IF IT WERE YOU.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.966
- WELL, AT LEAST HE DIDN'T
GET SICK AND LINGER.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.768
THAT'S THE WORST.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.704
- YEAH.
AND IN SUCH POOR TASTE.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.106
BUY A ONE-WAY TICKET
TO IBIZA, PARTY TILL YOU DROP,

10:06.139 --> 10:10.277
AND THEN DISCREETLY DISAPPEAR.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.378
- HERE YOU GO, SWEETHEART.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.646
- YOU'RE GREAT.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.147
- AW, THANK YOU.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.382
- TAKE CARE, MICHAEL.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.885
- EM, HONEY?
LITTLE MORE WINE?

10:17.918 --> 10:19.386
- CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.054
- NO, NO, NO, I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD, BABY.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.389
HOW ABOUT FOR YOU, SWEETHEART?

10:22.422 --> 10:24.391
- OH, UH...
- YEAH?

10:24.424 --> 10:27.327
YEAH? NO? OKAY.
[chuckles]

10:27.360 --> 10:30.130
I WRAPPED UP
THE COLD CUTS AND SALADS.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.900
- OH, I WAS ABOUT TO DO THAT.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.135
- MMM, DO YOU WANT THE CAKE
AND THE COOKIES IN THE FRIDGE?

10:35.168 --> 10:36.937
- I WANT YOU TO SIT DOWN,
ALL OF YOU.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.338
REALLY, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.308
- DEBBIE,
YOU HAVEN'T STOPPED ALL DAY.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.311
- WELL, IT'S BEST TO STAY BUSY.
- I AGREE.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.946
IN FACT, THEY'RE STARTING
SOME NEW CLASSES

10:45.979 --> 10:47.347
THIS WEEK AT THE CENTER.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.750
I WAS THINKING
I'D SIGN UP FOR POTTERY.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.418
HOW ABOUT YOU COME
JOIN ME, DEB?

10:51.451 --> 10:53.887
WE CAN GET OUR HANDS DIRTY.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.189
- THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.058
- AND THEY SAY
THAT DOING SOMETHING CREATIVE

10:58.091 --> 11:00.861
IS A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WAY
TO PROCESS YOUR GRIEF.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.163
- WELL, I'M ITALIAN.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.800
WHAT I FIND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE
IS FOOD AND PLENTY OF VINO.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.436
- DEB?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.471
- UH, UM...

11:11.504 --> 11:12.840
- HERE WE GO.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.175
- DEB?

11:15.208 --> 11:18.111
- OH.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP, BABY?

11:18.145 --> 11:19.913
- NOT AS GOOD AS YOU.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.815
- HERE, I BROUGHT YOU THIS.
SOME OF VIC'S THINGS.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.183
THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THEM.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.985
- OH.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.253
WELL, THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL
OF YOU.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.122
THANK YOU.

11:29.156 --> 11:32.826
- THERE'S SOME FAMILY PHOTOS,
HIS RINGS, AND WATCH.

11:32.860 --> 11:37.831
THERE'S ALSO, UH,
A LETTER ADDRESSED TO YOU.

11:37.865 --> 11:41.802
- A LETTER?
FOR ME?

11:41.835 --> 11:43.403
- LISTEN, WOULD YOU MIND
IF I TOOK OFF?

11:43.436 --> 11:45.138
I'M FEELING A LITTLE TIRED.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.841
- OH, NO. NO, NO, NO.
YOU GO AHEAD, YOU GET SOME REST.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.409
UM, HERE. TAKE THIS.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.078
- NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT...

11:51.111 --> 11:52.846
- NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE GONNA EAT, YOU HEAR ME?

11:52.880 --> 11:56.316
AND THIS TOO.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.124
- WE'LL BE THERE FOR YOU TOO.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.526
- AH.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.997
I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF.
- SEE YOU LATER.

12:10.030 --> 12:14.101
- WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.003
- COULD YOU COME BY NEXT WEEK?
- OKAY.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.905
- JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.040
- CALL ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
OKAY?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.408
- BYE.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.176
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

12:23.210 --> 12:25.178
- YEAH.
- BYE.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.255
[background chatter]

12:35.288 --> 12:37.257
- I DON'T KNOW.
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.127
- I CAN'T EAT ANY MORE.
I'M STUFFED.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.997
- MA, WHY DON'T YOU LET MEL
AND LINZ AND JENNIFER HELP YOU?

12:44.031 --> 12:45.899
- I'LL TAKE IT.
YES.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.000
- AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS A GREAT IDEA.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.869
- WHAT'S THAT?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.938
- OH.

12:50.971 --> 12:54.074
IT'S A LETTER
FROM YOUR UNCLE VIC.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.442
- OH.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.411
- HE WROTE IT TO ME
A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN...

12:58.445 --> 13:03.416
HE WAS SICK AND WE THOUGHT
HE WAS GONNA DIE.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.453
- WHAT DOES IT SAY?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.288
- SO I GUESS
THAT'S THE MAIN THING.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.289
- YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD.

13:09.322 --> 13:13.226
- IT SAYS...

13:13.260 --> 13:17.430
"WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PARTY."

13:17.464 --> 13:20.533
WE'RE HAVING A PARTY.

13:24.972 --> 13:28.375
- SEEING THAT BOX
AND KNOWING VIC WAS INSIDE,

13:28.408 --> 13:31.311
THAT WAS...TOUGH.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.246
- I BET.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.917
- BUT DEBBIE PICKED OUT
A REAL NICE SHIRT...

13:36.950 --> 13:39.386
WITH...

13:39.419 --> 13:42.389
HULA DANCERS AND PALM TREES.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.957
- AT LEAST HE'LL HAVE
SOMETHING TO WEAR

13:43.991 --> 13:47.928
WHEN HE GOES OUT DANCING.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.263
UH, HOPE THAI'S OKAY.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.499
- IT'S AMAZING.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.968
- BETTER TASTE IT FIRST.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.138
- I MEAN HOW CARING YOU ARE.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.340
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY
AT THE MEETING SAID.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.375
- I-I KNOW HOW STRESSFUL
FUNERALS CAN BE.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.212
I FIGURED YOU COULD
USE A LITTLE...

14:05.245 --> 14:06.513
COMFORT.
- MM.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.082
YOU FIGURED RIGHT,
COUNSELOR.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.484
- I GOT, UH, PAD THAI
AND MEE GROB.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.854
- LOVE IT.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.292
YOU KNOW WHAT I KEPT THINKING
THE WHOLE TIME?

14:19.326 --> 14:22.930
I KNOW IT'S AWFUL, BUT...

14:24.932 --> 14:28.268
THAT COULD'VE BEEN ME.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.103
ALL THOSE PEOPLE,

14:30.137 --> 14:31.638
MICHAEL AND BRIAN,

14:31.671 --> 14:34.174
MEL AND LINZ.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.509
EMMETT.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.379
THEY COULD'VE BEEN THERE
FOR MY FUNERAL.

14:39.412 --> 14:43.250
- [sighs]

14:43.283 --> 14:45.652
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
I WAS THINKING?

14:45.685 --> 14:50.057
HOW MUCH I WANTED
TO KISS YOU...

14:50.090 --> 14:51.658
AND BITE YOU...

14:51.691 --> 14:54.594
AND FUCK YOU...

14:54.627 --> 14:56.396
AND SUCK YOU.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.465
- WE SHOULD PROBABLY EAT
BEFORE IT GETS COLD.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.601
- BETTER THE PAD THAI
THAN YOU.

15:01.634 --> 15:05.205
- TED.
- MM-HMM?

15:05.238 --> 15:07.007
- I WAS EXPECTING
THE FUNERAL WOULD BE A DISASTER.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.541
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT,

15:08.575 --> 15:10.143
YOUR MOTHER WAS WELL-BEHAVED,

15:10.177 --> 15:12.045
YOU MADE A BEAUTIFUL SPEECH,

15:12.079 --> 15:14.147
AND YOUR HAIR LOOKED GREAT.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.083
- THANKS.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.717
DIDN'T IT SEEM
A LITTLE STRANGE TO YOU

15:17.750 --> 15:19.686
HOW WELL SHE WAS HOLDING UP?

15:19.719 --> 15:22.222
- WELL, MY GUESS IS
SHE'S STILL IN SHOCK.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.690
BESIDES, I'VE LOST
ENOUGH FRIENDS TO KNOW

15:23.723 --> 15:26.059
THERE'S NO RIGHT
OR WRONG WAY TO BEHAVE.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.560
EVERYONE GRIEVES
IN HIS OWN WAY

15:27.594 --> 15:29.362
AND IN HIS OWN...

15:29.396 --> 15:31.331
TIME.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.570
- JESUS, DO YOU SMELL THAT?

15:37.604 --> 15:42.575
- HUNTER?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.377
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

15:44.411 --> 15:47.714
- SMOKING YOUR HIDDEN JOINT.
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

15:47.747 --> 15:50.183
- IS THAT WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO COME WITH US TO MY MOM'S?

15:50.217 --> 15:51.985
SO YOU COULD STAY HERE
AND GET STONED?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.586
- BEATS THE HELL
OUT OF EATING COLD CUTS

15:53.620 --> 15:56.523
AND HEARING STORIES ABOUT
SOME OLD GUY I HARDLY KNEW.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.325
- THAT "OLD GUY" HAPPENED
TO BE MY UNCLE.

15:58.358 --> 16:02.062
- THEN YOU GO GET
ALL TEARY-EYED.

16:02.095 --> 16:06.399
I PREFER HAVING A TOKE.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.070
- WE'RE FOSTERING
A MINOR, MICHAEL.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.505
IF THEY FOUND OUT WE HAD POT
OR ANY OTHER ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES

16:12.539 --> 16:14.474
AROUND THE HOUSE,
WE COULD LOSE HIM.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.675
- I FORGOT I EVEN HAD IT.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.244
BRIAN GAVE IT TO ME
FOR EMERGENCIES.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.079
- HE OBVIOUSLY WENT
SNOOPING AND FOUND IT.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.314
MICHAEL?

16:24.184 --> 16:27.654
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:27.687 --> 16:30.223
- THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.224
- MICHAEL, WE CAN'T TELL HIM
NOT TO USE DRUGS

16:31.258 --> 16:32.292
IF WE DO IT OURSELVES.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.361
- OF COURSE WE CAN.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.330
THAT'S WHAT PARENTING'S
ALL ABOUT.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.606
- MM.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.648
"A SURPRISE AWAITS YOU."

16:55.682 --> 16:58.118
- MM.
- WHAT'S YOURS SAY?

16:58.151 --> 17:01.321
- "THE MAN YOU LOVE
WILL SLOWLY AND SENSUALLY

17:01.354 --> 17:03.156
"PEEL OFF ALL HIS CLOTHES
FOR YOU,

17:03.190 --> 17:06.659
"EXPOSING HIS PERFECT BODY.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.296
"THEN HE WILL

17:09.329 --> 17:11.798
"TAKE OUT...

17:11.831 --> 17:15.602
"HIS BEAUTIFUL DICK...

17:15.635 --> 17:17.337
AND YOU CAN SUCK IT."

17:17.370 --> 17:19.306
- THIS IS ONE LONG FORTUNE.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.408
- [grunts]

17:21.441 --> 17:25.044
THERE'S MORE.
- OH?

17:27.447 --> 17:31.451
- "NEXT, HE'LL RIM
YOUR ASS TO GET YOU CRAZY,

17:31.484 --> 17:34.087
"THEN RAM HIS COCK...

17:34.121 --> 17:38.658
UP YOU AND FUCK YOU SO HARD,
YOU PASS OUT."

17:42.195 --> 17:43.863
- "IN BED."

17:43.896 --> 17:45.432
- HMM.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.766
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ADD
"IN BED"

17:46.799 --> 17:48.568
TO THE END OF EVERY FORTUNE.

17:48.601 --> 17:53.173
- I WAS THINKING
"ON THE FLOOR."

17:53.206 --> 17:55.775
- OKAY.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.348
MM.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.317
[soft rock music]

18:04.351 --> 18:05.718
*

18:05.752 --> 18:10.190
[groans]

18:10.223 --> 18:11.524
- WHAT?

18:11.558 --> 18:14.494
- NOTHING.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.196
YOUR HAND'S COLD.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.399
- [chuckles]
I'LL WARM THEM UP.

18:19.432 --> 18:24.204
- THAT'S OKAY.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.806
I'M KIND OF TIRED.

18:26.839 --> 18:34.781
*

18:40.653 --> 18:42.755
- * AND HEAVEN AND HEAVEN

18:42.789 --> 18:44.624
* AND NATURE SING

18:44.657 --> 18:47.294
* HE RULES THE WORLD

18:47.327 --> 18:49.229
* WITH TRUTH AND GRACE

18:49.262 --> 18:53.266
* AND MAKES
THE NATIONS PROVE *

18:53.300 --> 18:55.902
* THE GLORIES OF

18:55.935 --> 18:57.704
* HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS

18:57.737 --> 19:00.373
* AND WONDERS OF HIS LOVE

19:00.407 --> 19:02.409
- OKAY. UM...

19:02.442 --> 19:05.178
WHEN I WENT TO BED,
IT WAS FEBRUARY,

19:05.212 --> 19:06.846
AND, UH,
I ONLY TOOK ONE XANAX.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.415
- SHIT!

19:08.448 --> 19:10.783
- SO EXACTLY HOW LONG
HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.785
- FUCK!

19:12.819 --> 19:16.389
I CAN'T TELL IF THESE BRANCHES
ARE TOPS OR BOTTOMS.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.525
- WELL, YOU GOT TO ASK
ANOTHER TREE ABOUT THAT ONE.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.294
DEB?

19:21.328 --> 19:22.862
- HUH?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.964
OH. CAN'T YOU SEE?
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.933
- CHRISTMAS.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.201
- BUT BEFORE YOU CALL
THE LOONY BIN

19:28.235 --> 19:29.302
AND HAVE THEM CART ME AWAY,

19:29.336 --> 19:32.672
IT'S FOR A DAMN GOOD REASON.

19:32.705 --> 19:36.276
RODNEY BROUGHT ME THIS LETTER
VIC WROTE A FEW YEARS AGO,

19:36.309 --> 19:38.478
AT, UH--AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING TO LOSE HIM.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.879
IT WAS JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
THE DOCTORS SAID THAT, UH,

19:39.912 --> 19:41.981
IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.351
SO IN THIS LETTER,

19:44.384 --> 19:47.220
HE MADE ME PROMISE
THAT EVEN IF HE WASN'T HERE,

19:47.254 --> 19:51.958
HE STILL WANTED US HAVE
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOLIDAY EVER.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.427
- BUT, DEB, HE WAS HERE.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.296
AND--AND NOT JUST
FOR THAT CHRISTMAS,

19:56.329 --> 19:57.764
BUT FOR MANY MORE CHRISTMASES.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.700
- YEAH, BUT HE'S GONE NOW.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.770
SO I SAY, WHAT BETTER WAY
TO PAY TRIBUTE

20:03.803 --> 20:06.005
THAN TO HAVE
ONE LAST CELEBRATION?

20:06.038 --> 20:10.243
- THAT'S VERY SWEET, DEB.
BUT AREN'T YOU A LITTLE LATE?

20:11.678 --> 20:13.613
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.847
IF SOMEBODY YOU LOVE
WRITES YOU A LETTER

20:14.881 --> 20:16.316
AND ASKS YOU
TO DO SOMETHING,

20:16.349 --> 20:19.819
YOU GOT NO CHOICE
BUT TO DO IT.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.857
YOU KNOW, CHOPPING DOWN
A FUCKING TREE

20:24.891 --> 20:26.293
WOULD'VE BEEN EASIER.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.667
- HEY, SLEEPYHEAD.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.637
[clears throat]

20:37.670 --> 20:41.508
ALARM WENT OFF
TEN MINUTES AGO.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.379
- I KNOW.
- HMM.

20:48.648 --> 20:53.386
- WELL, DON'T YOU HAVE PLACES TO
BE, THINGS TO DO, PEOPLE TO SEE?

20:55.922 --> 20:58.958
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD GET UP.

20:58.991 --> 21:02.629
- OH...AH.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.364
FIRST,

21:04.397 --> 21:07.367
WE SHOULD RELIEVE
THAT MORNING STIFFNESS.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.537
- TED. TED. TED, PLEA...
PLEASE. PLEASE.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.973
- WHAT, NOT IN THE MOOD?
- IT'S NOT THAT.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.576
- I DON'T...I-I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD DO THIS ANYMORE.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.512
WHAT? CUDDLE WITHOUT
OUR CLOTHES ON?

21:19.546 --> 21:24.317
PLAY "THIS LITTLE SEX PIGGY
WENT TO MARKET"?

21:33.560 --> 21:36.696
- YES.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.842
- OH.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.084
- LOOK, UH, TED, PLEASE,

21:58.117 --> 22:00.453
BEFORE YOU START THINKING
IT'S SOMETHING IT'S NOT...

22:00.487 --> 22:04.491
- YOU MEAN, THAT IT'S ME?

22:04.524 --> 22:05.692
- IT'S NOT.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.828
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
NEVER IS.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.698
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.032
- THAN TO GET INVOLVED?

22:13.065 --> 22:15.468
- IT WAS A MISTAKE.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.470
- TO FALL IN LOVE?

22:17.504 --> 22:19.906
HAVE SEX?
BE CLOSE?

22:24.744 --> 22:25.978
- TH-THE PROGRAM SAYS...

22:26.012 --> 22:28.448
- FUCK THE PROGRAM!
THIS IS MY LIFE.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.450
I'M ALLOWED
TO MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.752
- YES, AND AS YOUR COUNSELOR,
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY

22:32.785 --> 22:34.120
TO HELP YOU MAKE
THE RIGHT ONES.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.989
- UH...YOU HAVE.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.492
YOU'VE HELPED ME
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.993
IT'S LIKE THE WOMAN
AT THAT MEETING SAID.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.495
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE,

22:42.529 --> 22:45.865
HOW I COULD'VE SURVIVED
WITHOUT YOU.

22:45.898 --> 22:49.035
- IT DOESN'T INCLUDE
SLEEPING WITH YOU.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.606
- THEN WHY DID YOU?

22:53.640 --> 22:58.411
TO MAKE AMENDS?

22:58.445 --> 23:01.948
- THE SAME REASON YOU DID.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.883
BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

23:03.916 --> 23:07.520
- [scoffs]

23:07.554 --> 23:09.088
- BUT IT'S HURTING YOU.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.791
- HURTING ME?
HOW COULD IT BE HURTING ME?

23:11.824 --> 23:13.526
- BECAUSE YOU NEED TO FOCUS
ON YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

23:13.560 --> 23:18.465
NOTHING ELSE IS IMPORTANT,
AND THAT INCLUDES ME.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.114
- THE FUCKING ASSHOLE
TRIPPED ME.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.517
THEN HE LIED,
SAID IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.118
- WHAT, SO YOU HIT HIM?

23:39.151 --> 23:41.788
- GOT TO STAND UP
FOR YOURSELF.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.456
- YEAH, AND WHAT IF
HE'D MADE YOU BLEED?

23:43.490 --> 23:44.824
EVERYONE WOULD NEED TO
KNOW YOU'RE POSITIVE.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.192
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

23:46.225 --> 23:47.594
- YEAH. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANT.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.862
- LOOK,
YOU'VE BEEN DOING GREAT,

23:49.896 --> 23:52.699
BETTER THAN ANYONE EXPECTED.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.200
- PROVING WHAT?

23:54.233 --> 23:56.002
THAT HUSTLERS NOT ONLY
CAN GIVE EXPERT HEAD,

23:56.035 --> 23:57.236
THEY CAN EVEN WRITE
A BOOK REPORT?

23:57.269 --> 23:59.205
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.940
SO WHY WOULD YOU FUCK IT UP?

24:00.973 --> 24:03.676
- AS IF IT MATTERS
WHAT I GET ON MY S.A.T. SCORES,

24:03.710 --> 24:05.111
OR IF I'M
A NATIONAL MERIT SCHOLAR,

24:05.144 --> 24:08.080
SINCE I'M GOING TO END UP
IN A BOX LIKE VIC.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.116
- WHOA.
OKAY, LOOK.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.852
NOT LONG AGO, THE PERSON
WHO INFECTED ME DIED.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.754
- YOU KNEW HIM?
- YEAH.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.956
- AND YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM?
- HE WAS MY EX-LOVER.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.991
- SHIT.
YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.493
- THE POINT IS, AFTERWARD,

24:20.527 --> 24:22.028
I DID SOME PRETTY
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE THINGS.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.029
- LIKE WHAT?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.697
- LIKE TAKING STEROIDS,

24:24.731 --> 24:25.998
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THEY'D MAKE ME HEALTHIER.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.099
BUT THEY ONLY DID
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.701
AND IT DIDN'T CHANGE THE FACT

24:28.735 --> 24:29.702
THAT I STILL HAVE THIS THING
INSIDE OF ME,

24:29.736 --> 24:31.003
SAME AS YOU, BUT...

24:31.037 --> 24:34.106
NO MATTER HOW SCARED
OR ANGRY WE ARE,

24:34.140 --> 24:35.775
WE CAN'T SELF-DESTRUCT,

24:35.808 --> 24:38.244
WE CAN'T LET IT SABOTAGE
OUR LIVES.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.246
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.914
DUDE, I TOLD YOU.

24:41.948 --> 24:45.985
THE GUY TRIPPED ME,
THAT'S ALL.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.987
- ALL RIGHT.

24:48.020 --> 24:51.991
WELL, THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

24:52.024 --> 24:55.762
COME ON, LET'S...
LET'S GO HOME.

25:02.769 --> 25:07.273
- FOUND DONNER AND BLITZEN.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.208
- WANT ME TO HELP
ROUND THEM UP?

25:09.241 --> 25:12.679
- THANKS, HONEY.
I GOT THE HERD UNDER CONTROL.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.150
- HOLY CHRIST!

25:18.184 --> 25:22.521
- THE CRECHE SCENE.
THANKS FOR REMINDING ME.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.625
BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE YOU'VE SEEN THOSE, HUH?

25:25.658 --> 25:27.159
HE USED TO LOVE 'EM.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.062
EVERY YEAR HE'D SAY,
"WHERE THE WEINDEER, MA?"

25:30.096 --> 25:33.099
'CAUSE EVERY YEAR
WE'D PUT 'EM UP ON THE ROOF.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.767
THEN VIC GOT SICK.

25:34.801 --> 25:37.970
BUT THIS YEAR,
WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY,

25:38.004 --> 25:41.107
JUST LIKE WE USED TO.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.676
- WELL, I'LL LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR WEINDEER.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.244
- W-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

25:45.277 --> 25:49.616
- CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.
ONLY 310 DAYS LEFT.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.252
[door closes]

25:53.285 --> 25:55.655
- MA?

25:55.688 --> 25:57.624
MA...

26:00.693 --> 26:03.329
- I MUST'VE GONE UP AND DOWN
THESE STAIRS 20 TIMES TODAY.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.798
- I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR UNCLE VIC,

26:05.832 --> 26:07.734
BUT DON'T WEAR YOURSELF OUT.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.001
- OH, I'M FINE, HONEY.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.369
- WELL, AT LEAST
LET ME HELP YOU.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.138
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
- WELL, I'M HAPPY TO...

26:12.171 --> 26:13.339
- I ALREADY GOT IT.
- WELL, JUST--

26:13.372 --> 26:14.807
- MICHAEL,
WOULD YOU JUST LET GO?

26:14.841 --> 26:17.977
I DON'T WANT
YOUR GODDAMN HELP!

26:23.249 --> 26:26.018
- MA...

26:28.154 --> 26:30.022
- I-I JUST HAVE TO DO THIS.

26:30.056 --> 26:33.292
ALL OF IT BY MYSELF, OKAY?
- BUT WHY?

26:33.325 --> 26:37.096
- BECAUSE IT WAS
VIC'S LAST REQUEST.

26:37.129 --> 26:40.232
AND IF I DO
ALL OF IT PERFECTLY,

26:40.266 --> 26:44.003
THE WAY HE WOULD'VE WANTED,
THEN MAYBE...

26:44.036 --> 26:47.273
IT JUST HAS TO BE RIGHT,
THAT'S ALL. OKAY?

26:47.306 --> 26:51.678
NOTHING CAN GO WRONG.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.017
- [sighs]

26:58.050 --> 26:59.385
[laughter]

26:59.418 --> 27:02.722
- DOES NO ONE
RESPECT PRIVACY ANYMORE?

27:02.755 --> 27:04.991
IS IT ALL
BUT A FORGOTTEN RIGHT?

27:05.024 --> 27:07.293
- GUS HAS BEEN SAYING
"DADA" ALL DAY.

27:07.326 --> 27:11.263
- SO HE'S DEVELOPED A SUDDEN
INTEREST IN GERMAN SURREALISM.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.866
- I THINK HE MEANS YOU.
TRY TO BE AMUSING.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.136
HE'S BEEN AN ENFANT TERRIBLE
ALL DAY.

27:17.169 --> 27:20.673
- OH, WHAT'S THAT?

27:20.707 --> 27:24.744
WANT TO WATCH THAT?

27:24.777 --> 27:27.279
BOOP.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.447
DO YOU SEE THE...

27:28.480 --> 27:31.784
PRETTY BOY, GUS?

27:31.818 --> 27:34.420
HE NOT ONLY KNEW HOW TO LIVE...

27:34.453 --> 27:36.889
HE ALSO KNEW WHEN TO DIE.

27:36.923 --> 27:39.191
- NO.
- MM-HMM.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.827
- NO DIE.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.095
- NO SEEING HIMSELF...

27:43.129 --> 27:46.265
GET OLD AND GROSS.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.970
SEEING HIMSELF
GRADUALLY DECOMPOSE,

27:51.003 --> 27:55.775
NO "DIAPERS REVISITED."

27:55.808 --> 28:00.112
HE WENT OUT IN A BLAZE
OF GLORY, BOTH BALLS INTACT.

28:00.146 --> 28:02.148
- ISN'T HE A LITTLE YOUNG
FOR JAMES DEAN?

28:02.181 --> 28:04.183
- WELL, YOU DON'T WANT HIM
WATCHING TELETUBBIES, DO YOU?

28:04.216 --> 28:06.485
IT MIGHT MAKE HIM GAY.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.121
- YOU KNOW, IN YOUR OWN
WEIRD, SUBVERSIVE WAY,

28:09.155 --> 28:11.958
YOU'RE NOT A BAD FATHER.

28:11.991 --> 28:16.195
- WELL, I PREFER TO SEE MYSELF
AS THE ANTI-DAD.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.797
- WELL, WHATEVER YOU ARE...

28:17.830 --> 28:18.831
IF YOU'D LIKE TO
SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIM,

28:18.865 --> 28:20.499
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ASK.

28:20.532 --> 28:25.504
- I THINK I'LL STICK TO MY
UNCREDITED CAMEO APPEARANCES.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.942
- YOU KNOW, ONE DAY
IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE,

28:29.976 --> 28:33.379
WE'LL BE WATCHING HIM
GRADUATE FROM SCHOOL.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.748
THEN I IMAGINE HE'LL MEET
A LOVELY YOUNG GIRL...

28:35.782 --> 28:38.084
OR BOY.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.485
GET MARRIED, MAYBE.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.021
HAVE GRANDCHILDREN, MAYBE.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.255
- OH, YOU REALLY KNOW
HOW TO KILL A MOMENT, DON'T YOU?

28:43.289 --> 28:45.224
- DON'T WORRY.

28:45.257 --> 28:50.229
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE THE HOTTEST,
HANDSOMEST ANTI-GRANDPA EVER.

28:50.262 --> 28:53.833
- INSTEAD HE'S JOINED
THE PANTHEON OF CELEBRITIES

28:53.866 --> 28:56.102
WHO WILL BE REMEMBERED
AS BEING FOREVER YOUNG

28:56.135 --> 28:58.871
AND UNSPOILED BY TIME.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.373
- AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,
YOU HAVE TO GET SUSPENDED.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.843
- IT'S NOT LIKE I CALLED IN
A BOMB THREAT

29:03.876 --> 29:05.144
OR WENT ON A SHOOTING SPREE.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.013
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
SMARTASS!

29:07.046 --> 29:08.981
I'VE GOT ENOUGH SHIT
TO WORRY ABOUT

29:09.015 --> 29:10.116
WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY
ABOUT YOU TOO.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.284
- SO STOP WORRYING.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.921
- I WILL WORRY AS MUCH
AS I GODDAMN WELL PLEASE.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.255
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.524
- I WASN'T THINKING ANYTHING.

29:18.557 --> 29:19.859
- OBVIOUSLY.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.794
- [sighs]

29:21.828 --> 29:23.295
- YOU ARE NOT EXCUSED.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.131
- I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND GET YELLED AT.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.132
- THEN QUIT ACTING
LIKE AN IDIOT.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.000
- MICHAEL, STOP.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.336
- WELL, THAT'S ALL WE NEED,
FOR HIM TO GET INTO TROUBLE.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.138
- GO TO YOUR ROOM.

29:32.171 --> 29:35.942
GO ON.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.877
[door slams]

29:37.910 --> 29:41.881
- HE'S GOT TO UNDERSTAND HE
CAN'T GO AROUND PICKING FIGHTS.

29:41.914 --> 29:45.151
AND YOU CAN'T CODDLE HIM.
- I WASN'T CODDLING HIM.

29:45.184 --> 29:46.552
- WHAT HE CAN USE IS
SOME DISCIPLINE.

29:46.585 --> 29:49.221
- WHAT HE CAN USE
IS SOME UNDERSTANDING.

29:49.255 --> 29:52.424
LOOK, I KNOW YOU GOT A LOT
TO DEAL WITH, BUT SO DOES HE.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.161
- IT'S NOT HIS UNCLE
WHO JUST DIED.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.029
IT'S NOT HIS MOTHER
WHO'S GONE AROUND THE BEND.

29:57.063 --> 30:00.332
- NO, BUT HE'S THE ONE
WHO IS 16, WHO'S POSITIVE,

30:00.366 --> 30:01.567
WHO'S DEALING
WITH AN HIV-RELATED DEATH

30:01.600 --> 30:03.102
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.071
TRY TO IMAGINE
HOW TERRIFYING THAT MUST BE.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.606
SO IF HE'S ACTING OUT
RIGHT NOW,

30:07.639 --> 30:11.810
IT'S BECAUSE
HE'S SCARED SHITLESS.

30:15.614 --> 30:19.852
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

30:19.886 --> 30:24.223
- WHY SHOULD YOU?
YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

30:26.125 --> 30:30.262

32:54.306 --> 32:55.641
AND IF YOU'RE TOO OLD,

32:55.674 --> 32:57.209

NOT EVEN FUCKING CHRISTMAS.

GOING TO DO WHEN I CROAK?

37:26.044 --> 37:29.348
- LUCKILY FOR BOTH OF US,

37:29.381 --> 37:34.286
UM, BLAKE RETRIEVED IT
AND, UM, GAVE IT BACK TO ME.

37:36.555 --> 37:39.891
- I, UH...
DIDN'T KNOW HE DID THAT.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.394
- WELL, I'M--I'M, UH...
I'M GLAD HE DID,

37:42.428 --> 37:45.397
'CAUSE TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH...

37:45.431 --> 37:47.766
THERE WAS A PART OF ME THAT...

37:47.799 --> 37:51.703
DIDN'T WANT YOU TO RECOVER.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.772
WANTED YOU TO BE IN PAIN,

37:53.805 --> 37:58.710
FELT LIKE YOU DESERVED IT.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.679
PRETTY CUNTY, HUH?

38:00.712 --> 38:04.650
- NOT REALLY.

38:04.683 --> 38:08.420
I FELT THE SAME WAY MYSELF.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.658
- ANYWAY, UM...

38:12.691 --> 38:15.461
GOTTA HAND IT TO HIM.
HE'S A DAMN GOOD COUNSELOR.

38:15.494 --> 38:16.962
AND A...
AND A DAMN GOOD FRIEND

38:16.995 --> 38:19.798
TO CARE ABOUT YOU THAT MUCH.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.601
YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.

38:22.634 --> 38:26.004
WELL, TEDDY, I, UH...

38:26.037 --> 38:30.476
I JUST WANTED
TO WISH YOU THE BEST.

38:40.586 --> 38:43.455
- YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD USE A BLOW JOB.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.357
- I'LL SETTLE FOR A JOINT.

38:45.391 --> 38:48.860
I SUDDENLY FEEL
A PREPONDERANCE OF DEATH.

38:51.129 --> 38:54.500
- ISN'T THAT A PLAY
BY ARTHUR MILLER?

38:54.533 --> 38:58.670
- IT'S AN UNSETTLING OBSERVATION
BY MICHAEL NOVOTNY.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.610
EVERYWHERE I TURN, I'M...

39:04.643 --> 39:09.114
CONFRONTED WITH THE INEVITABLE
FACT OF ONE'S MORTALITY.

39:09.147 --> 39:13.919
- DEATH CAN REALLY
HANG YOU UP THE MOST.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.388
- I DON'T MEAN JUST VIC.

39:16.422 --> 39:20.792
BEN AND HUNTER.

39:20.826 --> 39:23.061
MAN, IT'S A...

39:23.094 --> 39:24.896
A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.765
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
TO THINK IT, BUT...

39:26.798 --> 39:30.469
THEY COULD DIE
JUST LIKE HIM...

39:30.502 --> 39:32.037
AND I'D BE THE ONE LEFT

39:32.070 --> 39:36.675
TO PACK UP THEIR STUFF
AND TURN OUT THE LIGHTS.

39:36.708 --> 39:41.012
- * TOGETHER,
HAND IN HAND *

39:41.046 --> 39:42.748
- JUST BECAUSE
THEY'RE POSITIVE DOESN'T MEAN

39:42.781 --> 39:47.185
THEY'RE GOING TO BE
THE FIRST TO GO.

39:47.218 --> 39:51.890
HELL, IT COULD BE YOU.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.493
YOU COULD STEP OUT
IN THE STREET...

39:54.526 --> 39:57.095
GET HIT...

39:57.128 --> 40:00.699
BY A MERCEDES KOMPRESSOR.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.068
SO MUCH CLASSIER THAN A BUS.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.537
- THANKS.

40:05.571 --> 40:08.507
- GO DOWN TO THE POST OFFICE
TO BUY A STAMP...

40:08.540 --> 40:10.909
GET BLOWN AWAY
BY A DISGRUNTLED POSTAL WORKER.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.444
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

40:12.478 --> 40:16.582
THESE DAYS,
THEY'RE ALL DISGRUNTLED.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.651
- * QUIET AS A GRAVE

40:19.685 --> 40:22.187
*

40:22.220 --> 40:24.790
* OUT BEYOND

40:24.823 --> 40:26.958
*

40:26.992 --> 40:29.961
- I JUST...

40:29.995 --> 40:33.965
I JUST GET SCARED
AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING ALONE.

40:36.234 --> 40:39.137
- IT'S HOW WE ALL CAME IN.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.675
IT'S HOW WE'RE ALL GOING OUT.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.544
- YEAH, BUT UNTIL THEN, I'D...

40:45.577 --> 40:49.247
I'D PREFER AT LEAST THE ILLUSION
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE THERE,

40:49.280 --> 40:53.819
IF ONLY TEMPORARILY.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.621
- BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT,
BUT...

40:55.654 --> 40:57.689
THE LESS YOU HAVE TO HOLD ON TO,
THE EASIER IT IS TO LET GO.

40:57.723 --> 40:59.758
[bottles clink]

40:59.791 --> 41:03.695
- MAYBE SO.

41:03.729 --> 41:08.166
STILL, I'M GLAD I HAVE YOU.

41:08.199 --> 41:11.870
- WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ME?

41:11.903 --> 41:14.773
- WELL...

41:14.806 --> 41:17.643
IT'S NICE TO KNOW
THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

41:17.676 --> 41:21.847
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE EACH OTHER,
LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.650
RIGHT?

41:35.627 --> 41:39.297
- NEED A LIFT?

41:39.330 --> 41:42.267
- UH, HEY. IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T HAVE THAT FAR TO WALK.

41:42.300 --> 41:46.004
- GETTING COLD.
FEELS LIKE SNOW.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.674
- THANKS ANYWAY.

41:48.707 --> 41:49.908
- PLEASE?

41:56.682 --> 41:58.283
- LOOK, UH...

41:58.316 --> 41:59.885
TED, I ALREADY TRIED
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU.

41:59.918 --> 42:00.952
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO TELL YOU.

42:00.986 --> 42:04.055
- THEN LET ME TALK, OKAY?

42:04.089 --> 42:05.557
LOOK, AFTER YOU TOLD ME

42:05.591 --> 42:07.292
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE ME ANYMORE...

42:07.325 --> 42:08.894
- I SAID IT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA
FOR US TO SEE EACH OTHER.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.830
- RIGHT. I WAS SO UPSET,
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

42:11.863 --> 42:14.700
- NO.

42:14.733 --> 42:18.169
- DR. C'S FINEST.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.338
GOOD PRICE TOO.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.173
- SHIT.

42:22.207 --> 42:23.909
- BUT AFTER WALKING IT AROUND,

42:23.942 --> 42:25.844
I DID A LITTLE ACCOUNTING,
AND I FIGURED,

42:25.877 --> 42:28.914
DOING THIS WOULD PUT ME
BACK IN THE MINUS COLUMN.

42:28.947 --> 42:31.983
THIS TIME, MAYBE PERMANENTLY.
SO I DECIDED TO PASS.

42:34.686 --> 42:38.690
- A WISE DECISION.

42:38.724 --> 42:42.694
- LOOK, WHEN WE FIRST MET...

42:42.728 --> 42:45.664
I FELL IN LOVE BECAUSE YOU
NEEDED ME TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

42:45.697 --> 42:47.332
THIS TIME, I FELL IN LOVE

42:47.365 --> 42:51.202
BECAUSE I NEEDED YOU TO
TAKE CARE OF ME, AND YOU HAVE.

42:51.236 --> 42:54.139
IN FACT, I WOULDN'T EVEN BE
STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW

42:54.172 --> 42:56.975
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

42:57.008 --> 43:00.612
AND I AM SO SORRY...

43:00.646 --> 43:05.583
IF I WAS TOO SELFISH
AND TOO HORNY TO SEE IT.

43:08.253 --> 43:11.757
- TH-THANK YOU...

43:11.790 --> 43:13.158
TED.

43:20.899 --> 43:24.269
- SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?
I MEAN...

43:24.302 --> 43:26.371
BESIDES BEING STUCK
WITH LOUSY TIMING ONCE AGAIN.

43:26.404 --> 43:31.376
- YEAH, WE DO SEEM
TO HAVE THAT, DON'T WE?

43:31.409 --> 43:34.245
MAYBE ONE DAY,
THE TIMING WILL BE RIGHT.

43:34.279 --> 43:37.382
- YOU THINK?

43:37.415 --> 43:39.751
- ONE CAN HOPE.

43:39.785 --> 43:42.387
- [scoffs]

43:42.420 --> 43:47.125
- OH...

43:47.158 --> 43:49.761
JUST IN CASE
YOU GET TEMPTED.

44:04.843 --> 44:06.144
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

44:06.177 --> 44:09.915
IT'S SNOWING.

44:15.854 --> 44:19.825
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE TAKING OFF.

44:19.858 --> 44:22.027
- FLIGHT 18.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.429
BARCELONA AND MADRID.

44:24.462 --> 44:27.098
CARE TO HELP ME
PRACTICE MY SPANISH?

44:27.132 --> 44:29.034
COMO ESTA USTED?

44:29.067 --> 44:32.370
- I'M FINE, THANK YOU,
BUT YOU MUST BE DEMENTED.

44:32.403 --> 44:35.206
- IT'S ONE OF THOSE
SPONTANEOUS SORT OF THINGS.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.775
- AND HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO...

44:36.808 --> 44:39.210
SPONTANEOUSLY
SORT OF COVER FOR YOU

44:39.244 --> 44:40.912
WHILE YOU'RE TANNING
YOUR ASS?

44:40.946 --> 44:43.448
YOU HAVE MEETINGS
WITH REMSON, BROWN, EYECONICS.

44:43.481 --> 44:47.352
- THEY CAN WAIT. THEY CAN
ALL WAIT UNTIL I GET BACK.

44:47.385 --> 44:49.354
- AND WHEN ARE YOU
COMING BACK?

44:49.387 --> 44:51.823
- I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

44:51.857 --> 44:53.925
- [chuckles] I HAVE WORKED
FOR YOU FOR FIVE YEARS,

44:53.959 --> 44:55.961
AND I'VE NEVER KNOWN YOU
TO JUST TAKE OFF.

44:55.994 --> 44:59.931
SO WHY NOW, WHEN YOU'VE
JUST OPENED UP YOUR OWN FIRM,

44:59.965 --> 45:01.933
WOULD YOU SUDDENLY
DECIDE THAT...

45:01.967 --> 45:04.202
- WELL, THAT'S THE POINT OF
BEING YOUR OWN BOSS, ISN'T IT?

45:04.235 --> 45:06.237
MAKE YOUR OWN HOURS,
COME AND GO AS YOU PLEASE,

45:06.271 --> 45:08.206
NOT ANSWER TO ANYONE.

45:08.239 --> 45:10.108
- ALMOST ANYONE.

45:10.141 --> 45:11.209
- AH, THE BALL AND CHAIN.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.845
CYNTHIA...

45:13.879 --> 45:15.881
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US?

45:15.914 --> 45:17.949
- BE SURE TO EAT
PLENTY OF FRESH FRUIT

45:17.983 --> 45:20.986
AND DRINK
LOTS OF TAP WATER.

45:21.019 --> 45:22.120
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

45:22.153 --> 45:25.791
- IBIZA.
I'M LEAVING TONIGHT.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.762
- WITHOUT ME?

45:30.796 --> 45:32.497
- WELL, YOU'RE GOING
BACK TO SCHOOL, REMEMBER?

45:32.530 --> 45:35.166
AND IT WOULD BE
HIGHLY IRRESPONSIBLE

45:35.200 --> 45:36.902
OF ME
TO JUST PULL YOU OUT.

45:36.935 --> 45:39.838
- FUCK SCHOOL.
FUCK THE BET.

45:39.871 --> 45:41.539
FUCK YOU. I MEAN, WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO GO TOGETHER.

45:41.572 --> 45:46.411
- WE'RE NOT FUCKING MARRIED!

45:48.046 --> 45:51.416
AND I DON'T NEED TO GET
YOUR FUCKING PERMISSION

45:51.449 --> 45:56.287
IF I WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE.

46:04.896 --> 46:06.431
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

46:06.464 --> 46:08.433
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

46:08.466 --> 46:13.271
WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION
TO TELL EACH OTHER ANYTHING.

46:13.304 --> 46:15.273
LOOK, IF I DID SOMETHING
OR SAID SOMETHING

46:15.306 --> 46:19.210
TO PISS YOU OFF,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

46:22.113 --> 46:25.316
- IT'S NOT YOU.

46:25.350 --> 46:28.019
- HEY, WHAT IS IT?

46:28.053 --> 46:30.822
THEN WHAT?

46:40.465 --> 46:42.300
OKAY.

46:42.333 --> 46:44.569
YOU GO DO
WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO

46:44.602 --> 46:47.305
FOR WHATEVER REASON
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

46:47.338 --> 46:52.243
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I LOVE YOU.

46:52.277 --> 46:54.479
AND I'LL BE HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

47:32.117 --> 47:35.353
- * DECK THE HALLS
WITH BOUGHS OF HOLLY *

47:35.386 --> 47:38.123
* ROCKIN' AROUND
THE CHRISTMAS TREE *

47:38.156 --> 47:42.127
* HAVE A HAPPY HOLIDAY

47:42.160 --> 47:45.230
* EVERYONE DANCING MERRILY

47:45.263 --> 47:56.141
* IN THE NEW
OLD-FASHIONED WAY *

47:56.174 --> 48:00.011
[cheers and applause]

48:00.045 --> 48:02.013
- THANK YOU.

48:02.047 --> 48:04.382
- YOU'RE TOO KIND.

48:04.415 --> 48:05.650
- I ALWAYS KNEW
THAT SHANDA LEER

48:05.683 --> 48:07.252
WOULD BE BACK
ON HER HEELS AGAIN.

48:07.285 --> 48:09.988
- YOU CAN'T KEEP
A GOOD DRAG QUEEN DOWN.

48:10.021 --> 48:12.390
SO IS IT TRUE GENTLEMEN
PREFER BLONDES?

48:12.423 --> 48:15.426
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GENTLEMEN,
BUT DIRTY OLD MEN SURE DO.

48:15.460 --> 48:16.995
- EVEN BETTER.

48:17.028 --> 48:18.696
- I KEEP THINKING,
I CAN HARDLY WAIT

48:18.729 --> 48:20.298
FOR ALL
THE AFTER-CHRISTMAS SALES.

48:20.331 --> 48:22.333
THEN I REMEMBER
IT ISN'T CHRISTMAS.

48:22.367 --> 48:24.002
- DEB REALLY WENT ALL OUT.

48:24.035 --> 48:25.270
- HOW ABOUT THOSE ELVES

48:25.303 --> 48:27.138
IN LEATHER HARNESSES
IN THE FRONT YARD?

48:27.172 --> 48:30.175
- THAT WAS UNCLE VIC'S IDEA.

48:30.208 --> 48:32.010
- HELP YOURSELF.
TRY THE SANTA ONE.

48:32.043 --> 48:33.478
IT WAS VIC'S FAVORITE.

48:33.511 --> 48:38.149
WHEN HE WAS A KID,
HE USED TO BITE THE HEAD OFF.

48:38.183 --> 48:40.418
- I WISH HE WERE HERE NOW
TO SHARE THESE WITH US.

48:40.451 --> 48:44.289
- WHO'S TO SAY HE ISN'T?
SO LET HIM SEE YOU SMILE.

48:44.322 --> 48:46.591
GO.
[laughs]

48:46.624 --> 48:49.494
- * AND HEAVEN
AND NATURE SING *

48:49.527 --> 48:51.562
* AND HEAVEN AND HEAVEN

48:51.596 --> 48:54.165
- WANT SOME?

48:54.199 --> 48:56.101
- OH, ACTUALLY,
I HATE EGGNOG.

48:56.134 --> 48:57.468
- AH, ME TOO.

48:57.502 --> 48:59.604
SOMEHOW I FEEL OBLIGATED.

48:59.637 --> 49:01.106
- * HE RULES THE WORLD

49:01.139 --> 49:03.741
* WITH TRUTH AND GRACE

49:03.774 --> 49:06.077
- WELL.

49:06.111 --> 49:08.313
ONE NICE THING ABOUT CELEBRATING
CHRISTMAS OFF-SEASON...

49:08.346 --> 49:11.649
- THE RATES ARE CHEAPER?

49:11.682 --> 49:15.753
- YOU GET TO BE REMINDED AGAIN
TO LOVE YOUR FELLOW MAN.

49:15.786 --> 49:19.324
- * HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS

49:19.357 --> 49:20.658
- MERRY CHRISTMAS, EM.

49:20.691 --> 49:22.627
- YOU TOO, TEDDY.

49:22.660 --> 49:25.063
- * AND WONDERS OF HIS LOVE

49:25.096 --> 49:26.464
[bells ringing]

49:26.497 --> 49:29.367
- CAN I HAVE
EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION, PLEASE?

49:29.400 --> 49:33.038
EVERYBODY, COME ON IN.

49:36.374 --> 49:39.377
THIS YEAR, CHRISTMAS
HAS COME A LITTLE EARLY,

49:39.410 --> 49:42.380
OR A LITTLE LATE,
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

49:42.413 --> 49:45.783
BUT, UH, EITHER WAY
IT'S HERE.

49:45.816 --> 49:49.620
AND, UM, THAT'S 'CAUSE THAT'S
THE WAY VIC WOULD'VE WANTED IT,

49:49.654 --> 49:51.122
TO HAVE ALL HIS FRIENDS

49:51.156 --> 49:54.359
CELEBRATING
HIS FAVORITE HOLIDAY...

49:54.392 --> 49:55.693
AND HIM.

49:55.726 --> 49:58.029
- HEAR, HEAR.
all: HEAR, HEAR.

49:58.063 --> 50:02.533
- SO NOW, TIME TO ADD
THE FINISHING TOUCH

50:02.567 --> 50:04.669
TO THE FESTIVITIES.

50:04.702 --> 50:06.371
EVERY YEAR, VIC AND I USED TO

50:06.404 --> 50:09.574
FIGHT ABOUT WHO GETS TO PUT
THE ANGEL ON THE TREE.

50:09.607 --> 50:12.510
USUALLY HE WON, 'CAUSE...

50:12.543 --> 50:14.245
I LET HIM.

50:14.279 --> 50:17.182
[laughs]

50:17.215 --> 50:20.051
BUT NOW...

50:20.085 --> 50:23.421
THIS YEAR, BABY BROTHER...

50:23.454 --> 50:28.426
I'M DOING IT, IN YOUR HONOR.

50:28.459 --> 50:30.695
- CAREFUL, MA.

50:30.728 --> 50:32.397
IF I CAN CLIMB UP
ON TOP OF A ROOF,

50:32.430 --> 50:37.202
I CAN CLIMB UP ON TOP
OF A FUCKIN' CHAIR.

50:42.307 --> 50:43.741
- HEY.

50:43.774 --> 50:46.711
[applause]

50:46.744 --> 50:51.282
