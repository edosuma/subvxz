- No, sir.

from the colony for over 12 hours.

any signs of life?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.693
None.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.946
The surface environment
is safe for transport, commander.

00:49.425 --> 00:52.887

03:19.867 --> 03:22.828
<i>No sign remains
of the 900 inhabitants.</i>

03:22.995 --> 03:27.583
The truth is,
hell, we are not ready.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.919
We've known they were coming
for over a year.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.838
We've thrown every resource
we have into this, but still--

03:33.005 --> 03:34.882
Then you're convinced
it is the Borg?

03:35.049 --> 03:37.218
That's what I'm here to find out.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.428
The initial descriptions
of these surface conditions

03:39.595 --> 03:42.139
are almost identical
to your report from System J-25.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.309
Commander Riker wrote those reports.
He agrees with you.

03:45.476 --> 03:50.481
Commander Shelby took over
Borg tactical analysis six months ago.

03:50.648 --> 03:54.860
I've learned to give her a wide latitude
when I want to get things done.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.655
That's how I intend to operate here.

03:58.155 --> 04:02.409
My priority has been to develop some
kind, any kind, of defense strategy.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.620
Obviously, nothing we have now
can stop them.

04:04.954 --> 04:06.497
We've been designing
new weapons,

04:06.830 --> 04:08.540
but they're all still
on the drawing board.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.043
We expected much more lead time.

04:11.210 --> 04:15.130
Your encounter with the Borg
was over 7000 light-years away.

04:15.297 --> 04:18.217
If this is the Borg, it would indicate
they have a source of power

04:18.384 --> 04:19.843
far superior to our own.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.554
I'd like to see the colony site
as soon as possible, captain.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.098
It'll be dark there in 30 minutes.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.849
We've scheduled an Away Team
for dawn.

04:26.016 --> 04:29.019
Number One, why don't you show
the commander to her quarters?

04:31.855 --> 04:33.440
It's our poker night, admiral.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.068
There's always an open seat
for you.

04:36.485 --> 04:40.364
Another time, commander.
Your captain and I have a lot to cover.

04:40.531 --> 04:45.661
But rumor has it, Commander Shelby
has played a hand or two.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.289
[HANSON CHUCKLES]

04:50.541 --> 04:53.127
Keep your eye on her, Jean-Luc.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.213
She's one very impressive
young lady.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.632
You seem rather taken
with her, J.P.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.885
Just an old man's fantasies.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.888
When Shelby came into Tactical,

05:05.055 --> 05:09.184
every admiral's uncle had a take
on this Borg business.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.980
She cut through it.
She put us on track.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.609
- Earl Grey?
- Please.

05:18.277 --> 05:20.612
She'd make you
one hell of a first officer.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.449
Already have a hell of a first officer.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.452
Don't tell me he's gonna pass up
another commission.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.040
- One's available?
- The Melbourne.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.584
It's his, if he wants it.
Hasn't he told you?

05:35.377 --> 05:37.421
He'll make a fine captain, J.P.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.925
You may wanna tell him that.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.053
We're still waiting on his decision.

05:45.054 --> 05:49.558
This is the third time we've pulled out
the captain's chair for Riker.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.478
He just won't sit down.

05:53.062 --> 05:54.605
Well, let me tell you something,
Jean-Luc.

05:55.481 --> 05:59.276
There are a lot of young hotshots
like Shelby on the way up.

05:59.443 --> 06:03.155
Riker could suddenly look like
he's standing still next to them.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.158
He's hurting his career
by staying put.

06:06.325 --> 06:10.454
And if I were you, I'd kick him
in the rear end for his own good.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.005
I don't know exactly
what I'm looking for,

06:20.172 --> 06:22.174
but we've tested the sections
of the Enterprise's hull

06:22.341 --> 06:23.884
that were damaged by the Borg.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.470
There were some unusual
magnetic resonance traces.

06:27.096 --> 06:28.389
A Borg footprint?

06:28.972 --> 06:32.184
That's my theory.
I'll see if it holds up tomorrow.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.477
I've reviewed your personnel.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.437
I'll be assigning Mr. La Forge
and Mr. Data

06:35.604 --> 06:38.023
to accompany me
on the Away Team.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.151
I've already assigned them
to the Away Team.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.487
And I'll be with you
as well, commander.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.658
Of course. I appreciate
any assistance you can offer.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.620
Tell me, commander,

06:51.954 --> 06:54.081
as extraordinary an experience
as I've heard?

06:54.498 --> 06:56.041
Every bit.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.837
Good, because I intend
to convince Captain Picard

07:00.003 --> 07:01.672
that I'm the right choice for the job.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.966
Job? Which job?

07:04.508 --> 07:05.884
Yours, of course.

07:08.512 --> 07:12.599

I heard that you were leaving.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.371
I am afraid
I cannot answer that, Wesley.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.998
And as you are a newcomer
to the game,

07:36.165 --> 07:38.876
may I say, it is inappropriate
for you to ask.

He's got the straight flush, folks.

08:14.953 --> 08:19.583
Not necessarily. Commander Riker
may be bluffing, Wesley.

straight A's in school,

- On whose authority?
- On hers, sir.

Morning. Early bird

09:51.091 --> 09:53.051
Walk with me, commander.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.478
Early bird...?

10:03.645 --> 10:05.564
I believe Commander Shelby erred.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.316
There is no evidence of avifaunal

10:07.482 --> 10:09.735
or crawling vermicular life forms
on Jouret IV.

10:10.068 --> 10:15.741
That's not what she meant, Data.
But you're right, she erred.

10:19.786 --> 10:20.996
I'm sorry, but I woke up early

10:21.163 --> 10:23.206
and I saw that a weather system
was moving in.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.083
It could have
affected the soil readings.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.628
So without any regard for the risk
of coming down here alone--

10:27.794 --> 10:30.005
Really, commander,
if we ran into the Borg here,

10:30.172 --> 10:33.175
two extra bodies wouldn't have made
a hell of difference, now, would they?

10:33.342 --> 10:35.594
We had three hours
before the storm front hit,

10:35.761 --> 10:37.179
less than two hours now.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.640

I took him, we came.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.266

10:41.433 --> 10:43.518
My problem, commander,
is I expect to be notified

before there's a change
in my orders.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.689

The soil contains
the same magnetic resonance traces.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.642

without interruption.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.145
What kind of damage would we have
to do to shut them down?

14:55.604 --> 14:57.606
Projections suggest
that a Borg ship like this one

14:57.772 --> 15:01.776
could continue to function effectively
even if 78 percent of it was inoperable.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.362
And our best shot
barely scratched the surface.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.197
Well, from what I've seen,

15:06.364 --> 15:08.950
I can't believe that any of these
new weapon systems can be ready

15:09.117 --> 15:10.911
in less than 18 months,
commander.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.038
We've been projecting 24.

15:13.330 --> 15:16.499
Is there anything we could do here
to adapt our current defense systems?

15:17.876 --> 15:20.587
We'll have to go
through the specs again, but...

My mind's turned to clay.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.594
Mine too.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.430
I think we should look at modifying
the plasma phaser design.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.557
Commander, I think
we should call it a night.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.893
That's an order.
We'll reconvene at 0500.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.897
Sir, if I may be allowed to continue with
Mr. Data, who does not require rest.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.857
You need rest, commander.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.484
If we have a confrontation
with the Borg

15:42.651 --> 15:44.027
without improving
our defense systems--

15:44.361 --> 15:47.364
If we have a confrontation,
I don't want a crew fighting the Borg

15:47.530 --> 15:51.368

their own fatigue. Dismissed.

Mr. La Forge has a plan
to modulate shield nutation.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.191
Hopefully, that'll hold them off
for a while.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.068
At the same time,
we'll be retuning phasers

human life forms, only our technology.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.055
Their priorities seem
to have changed.

19:41.222 --> 19:44.058
- Open.
WORF: Channel open.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.436
We have developed
new defense capabilities

Captain, the Borg are attempting
to lock on to us with their tractor beam.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.415
Load torpedo bays, arm phasers.

20:07.582 --> 20:09.626
Lock coordinates on the source
of the tractor beam.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.254
Holding, sir.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.381
The nutation modulation
has them confused.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.760
They have the ability to analyze
and adapt, commander.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.391
Shield modulation has failed.
They've locked on.

Fire all weapons.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.415

The damage is pretty heavy.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.375
We lost a lot of good people
down there.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.295
Eleven dead,
eight more unaccounted for, captain.

Repair teams to Engineering,
seal hull breach.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.425
They didn't get to the core.
I can control functions from here.

Now approaching
the Paulson Nebula, sir.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.638
Drop to impulse.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.398
Take us in, ensign.

22:46.741 --> 22:49.994
- The field's getting too dense, sir.
- Steady.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.125
Analysis of the nebula cloud,
Mr. Data.

22:56.292 --> 23:00.171
Eighty-two percent dilithium hydroxyls,
magnesium chromium.

23:00.338 --> 23:04.092
Should provide an effective screen
against their sensors, captain.

23:04.592 --> 23:08.096
Mr. La Forge,
prepare to reverse engines, full stop.

23:21.359 --> 23:24.946
The Borg ship is continuing scans,
attempting to locate us.

23:25.113 --> 23:31.077
Good. As long as they're looking
for us, they won't hurt anyone else.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.542
Time index 514.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.628
Data started to fluctuate
phaser resonance frequencies.

23:40.795 --> 23:43.631
The Borg's beam breaks contact.
Slow playback.

23:43.965 --> 23:46.717
Take a closer look, commander.
Mr. La Forge?

23:47.093 --> 23:49.470
LA FORGE: There's a two-percent
drop in power for an instant,

23:49.637 --> 23:50.805
but it is system-wide.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.558
The phaser-frequency spread
was in a high, narrow band.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.726
Conceivably,
the ship's power distribution nodes

23:56.060 --> 23:57.979
are vulnerable to those frequencies.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.022
If we can generate
a concentrated burst of power

24:00.189 --> 24:02.233
at that same frequency distribution,

24:02.400 --> 24:04.777
I mean, a lot more than anything
our phasers or photon torpedoes

24:04.944 --> 24:05.987
could ever provide...

24:06.154 --> 24:08.656
- How do we do that?
- The main deflector dish.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.491
It's the only component
designed to channel

24:10.658 --> 24:12.660
that much power
at controlled frequencies.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.537
End program.

24:14.704 --> 24:17.248
Unfortunately,
there is one slight detail.

24:17.415 --> 24:21.419
In the process, the blast completely
destroys the Enterprise as well.

24:21.586 --> 24:25.006
If we could get further away,
increase the deflector's range...

24:25.173 --> 24:26.257
SHELBY:
It could work.

24:26.424 --> 24:28.176
In the meantime,
we should retune all phasers,

24:28.342 --> 24:30.344
including the hand units,
to the same frequency.

24:31.179 --> 24:32.722
Proceed. I'll inform the captain.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.391
There is one other recommendation
I'd like to make, commander.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.226
Separate the saucer section.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.479
Assign a skeleton crew
to create a diversion.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.023
We may need the power
from the saucer's impulse engines.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.358
It would give them more
than one target to worry about.

24:44.525 --> 24:45.735
It's too great a risk.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.529
I'd like the captain
to make that decision, sir.

24:49.489 --> 24:53.534
Commander, I bring all the alternatives
to the captain's attention.

24:53.701 --> 24:55.536
That'll be all.

25:02.543 --> 25:05.546
I'm gonna install higher-capacity power
transformers to the deflector dish.

25:05.713 --> 25:08.216
- How long?
- Better part of a day.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.426

doesn't she?

25:10.593 --> 25:12.678
Mm-hm. She's a formidable presence,
to say the least,

25:12.845 --> 25:14.597
but I'm convinced
she can help us here, commander.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.015
I am too.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.684
Don't worry about it.
I can handle Shelby.

25:28.152 --> 25:30.029
Come in, Number One.

Commander Shelby was just telling me
of your concerns about her plan.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.580
I'm sorry she troubled you, sir.
I have already informed her--

Yes, I entirely agree with you,

I want you to consider her plan
as a fallback position.

to have a conversation.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.993
You never ordered me
not to discuss this with the captain.

26:17.159 --> 26:19.537
You disagree with me, fine.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.873
You need to take it to the captain, fine.
Through me.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.376
You do an end run around me again,

26:25.543 --> 26:28.671
I'll snap you back so hard, you'll think
you're a first-year cadet again.

26:29.672 --> 26:33.050
- May I speak frankly, sir'?
- By all means.

26:33.384 --> 26:34.677
You're in my way.

26:36.470 --> 26:39.932
Really? How terrible for you.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.393
All you know how to do
is play it safe.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.771
I suppose that's why someone like you
sits in the shadow of a great man

26:45.938 --> 26:47.023
for as long as you have,

26:47.189 --> 26:49.233
passing up one command
after another.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.402

When it comes to this ship
and this crew,

26:55.156 --> 26:57.908
you're damned right, I play it safe.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.995
If you can't make
the big decisions, commander,

27:01.162 --> 27:03.706
I suggest you make room
for someone who can.

the captain touring the ship
before a battle.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.072
GUINAN:
Ooh.

28:18.239 --> 28:22.493
Before a hopeless battle,
if I remember the tradition correctly.

28:22.660 --> 28:23.703
Not necessarily.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.789
Nelson toured the H.M.S. Victory
before Trafalgar.

28:27.873 --> 28:31.168

We should be back up
in eight to 12 hours, admiral.

45:52.167 --> 45:54.419
<i>Well, we'll miss you at the party.</i>

45:54.586 --> 45:55.795
<i>The Enterprise will be there.</i>

45:56.129 --> 45:57.797
Maybe a little late,
but we'll be there, sir.

45:58.548 --> 46:01.676
<i>Your engagements
have given us valuable time.</i>

46:01.843 --> 46:05.805
<i>We've mobilized a fleet
of 40 starships at Wolf 359,</i>

46:06.139 --> 46:07.474
<i>and that's just for starters.</i>

46:07.807 --> 46:09.809
<i>The Klingons are sending warships.</i>

46:10.143 --> 46:13.271
<i>Hell, we've even thought of opening
communications with the Romulans.</i>

46:13.438 --> 46:15.857
You realize, admiral, that
with the assistance of Captain Picard,

46:16.149 --> 46:17.817
the Borg will be ready
for your defenses.

46:19.652 --> 46:21.154
<i>Lieutenant, a few years ago,</i>

46:21.321 --> 46:24.282
<i>I watched a freshman cadet
pass four upperclassmen</i>

46:24.449 --> 46:28.411
<i>on the last hill of a 40-kilometer run
at Delula ll.</i>

46:28.578 --> 46:30.330
<i>The damnedest thing I ever saw.</i>

46:30.497 --> 46:34.459
<i>The only freshman
to ever win the Academy marathon.</i>

46:34.626 --> 46:36.669
<i>I made it my business to get to know
that young fella</i>

46:37.003 --> 46:38.421
<i>and got to know him very, very well.</i>

46:38.588 --> 46:40.089
<i>And I'll tell you something:</i>

46:41.174 --> 46:44.219
<i>I never met anyone
with more drive, determination,</i>

46:44.385 --> 46:47.347
<i>or more courage
than Jean-Luc Picard.</i>

46:47.514 --> 46:51.559
<i>And there is no way in hell
that he would assist the Borg.</i>

46:51.726 --> 46:53.686
<i>I want that clear.</i>

46:54.687 --> 46:56.189
Of course, admiral.

46:56.356 --> 47:01.277
<i>He is a casualty of war.</i>

47:03.029 --> 47:06.449
Then we have abandoned
all hope of recovering him.

47:07.075 --> 47:08.201
<i>In less than 24 hours,</i>

47:08.368 --> 47:13.373
<i>this armada's going to hit that Borg
vessel with everything we can muster.</i>

47:14.874 --> 47:17.126
<i>Either they survive or we do.</i>

47:18.253 --> 47:19.838
<i>As for Picard,</i>

47:20.713 --> 47:23.216
<i>a great man has been lost.</i>

47:23.383 --> 47:27.053
<i>Your captain. My friend.</i>

47:29.514 --> 47:31.224
<i>Commander Riker,</i>

47:31.391 --> 47:34.310
<i>I hereby promote you
to the field commission of captain.</i>

47:34.811 --> 47:38.439
<i>The Enterprise is your ship now.
Congratulations.</i>

47:39.524 --> 47:41.568
<i>I wish the circumstances
were different.</i>

47:42.235 --> 47:45.738
Likewise. Good luck, admiral.

47:47.031 --> 47:49.033
<i>To us all.</i>

48:43.963 --> 48:45.632
And Mr. Crusher suggests
we might design a chip

48:45.798 --> 48:47.634
that would automatically
retune the phasers

48:47.800 --> 48:49.344
to a random setting
after each discharge.

48:49.510 --> 48:52.138
- Engineering.
- That would be a great advantage.

48:52.305 --> 48:53.723
We should also see
if there's some way

48:54.057 --> 48:55.558
that we can neutralize
their force fields.

48:55.725 --> 48:58.478
We've gotta let them know
that we can adapt too, Mr. Worf.

48:58.645 --> 49:00.480
We're no longer
just fighting the Borg,

49:00.647 --> 49:03.650
we're fighting the life experience
they've stolen from Captain Picard.

49:03.816 --> 49:05.276
Now, how the hell
do we defeat an enemy

49:05.443 --> 49:07.070
that knows us
better than we know ourselves?

49:07.236 --> 49:10.156
The Borg have neither
honor nor courage.

49:10.323 --> 49:14.160
- That is our greatest advantage.
- I hope it's enough.

49:17.664 --> 49:20.208
Accelerator coils
are responding normally.

49:20.375 --> 49:24.754
Excellent. Forward shields
at 58 percent, aft shields...

49:25.046 --> 49:27.298
- Sensors must be down.
SHELBY: Checking.

49:28.049 --> 49:30.760
Sensors are fine. No.

49:31.094 --> 49:33.304
Aft shields have completely failed.
Damn it!

49:33.471 --> 49:35.348
Auxiliary generators are out again.

49:35.515 --> 49:37.100
Just the man I need.

49:37.684 --> 49:39.477
We're having some problems
with the aft shields,

49:39.644 --> 49:42.522
generators going on- and off-line.
I could really use your help, Worf.

49:42.730 --> 49:44.399
How soon do we
get under way, Geordi?

49:44.565 --> 49:46.776
Still a couple of hours.
Commander Shelby can fill you in.

49:50.697 --> 49:52.657
The main navigational deflector
is functional again.

49:52.824 --> 49:55.660
Sherbourne and Barclay are running
the final testing sequence now.

49:55.827 --> 49:57.453
The warp-reactor core?

49:57.620 --> 50:00.790
Reconstruction is proceeding normally.
It's slow work.

50:01.082 --> 50:03.668
If we can nail down this
shield-generator problem...

50:03.835 --> 50:05.044
I agree with La Forge.

50:05.211 --> 50:07.505
We'll be back at operating capacity
in two to three hours.

50:07.672 --> 50:09.173
Good.

50:12.093 --> 50:13.302
Anything else, sir?

50:13.845 --> 50:16.556
Yes. You did a good job
on the Borg ship.

50:17.557 --> 50:18.850
I didn't get Picard.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.769
You stopped them.
You gave us our shot.

50:23.271 --> 50:24.731
- Sir, I--
- Commander,

50:25.064 --> 50:27.275
we don't have to like each other
to work well together.

50:27.442 --> 50:30.403
As a matter of fact, I'd like you
to continue to keep me on my toes.

50:31.279 --> 50:33.865
Some might define that
as the role of a first officer.

50:34.449 --> 50:37.493
Damn. You are ambitious,
aren't you, Shelby?

50:38.077 --> 50:40.663
Captain Riker,
based on our past relationship,

50:40.830 --> 50:43.624
there's no reason for me to expect
to become your first officer,

50:43.791 --> 50:45.251
except that you need me.

50:45.418 --> 50:48.087
I know how to get things done
and I have the expertise in the Borg.

50:48.254 --> 50:50.256
And you have a lot to learn,
commander.

50:52.133 --> 50:53.301
Yes, sir.

50:53.593 --> 50:54.802
Almost as much as I had to learn

50:55.094 --> 50:57.680
when I came on board
as Captain Picard's first officer,

50:57.847 --> 50:59.098
a fact he reminded me of

50:59.265 --> 51:01.601
when I commented on
what a pain in the neck you are.

51:02.435 --> 51:03.770
Yes, sir.

51:03.936 --> 51:06.272
DATA [OVER <i>PA]: Data to Riker.</i>
<i>Message from Starfleet, captain.</i>

51:06.439 --> 51:07.774
Go ahead, Data.

51:08.107 --> 51:12.195
Starfleet reports it has engaged
the Borg at Wolf 359, sir.

51:19.118 --> 51:21.829
Admiral Hanson
on subspace, captain.

51:23.164 --> 51:24.916
On-screen.

51:26.375 --> 51:27.919
Admiral?

51:28.211 --> 51:30.671
<i>The fight does not go well,
Enterprise.</i>

51:30.838 --> 51:33.674
<i>We're attempting to withdraw
and regroup.</i>

<i>Communications from the

52:00.952 --> 52:03.121
<i>possibly due to Borg interference.</i>

52:03.287 --> 52:06.666
Lieutenant Worf, everyone
in this room shares my respect

52:06.958 --> 52:08.459
for your service to this ship.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.921
But right now,
I need your experience at tactical.

52:12.463 --> 52:16.634
Commander Data, I realize
your very nature omits ambition.

52:16.926 --> 52:18.094
Nevertheless, I want you to know

52:18.261 --> 52:20.096
I seriously considered you
as first officer.

52:20.263 --> 52:21.681
Thank you, sir.

52:22.306 --> 52:24.684
But this is not the time for change.

52:24.976 --> 52:26.644
I need all of you where you are.

52:26.978 --> 52:30.523
Where Captain Picard
always relied on you.

52:30.857 --> 52:33.651
I have been, reluctantly,

52:33.985 --> 52:35.987
forced to conclude
that Commander Shelby,

52:36.154 --> 52:40.658
our expert on the Borg, is an
ideal choice at this time for first officer.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.831
Based on our latest communication,

52:46.998 --> 52:50.334
we can assume that the Borg
survived the fleet's attack.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.003
Your thoughts
on our next encounter?

52:52.461 --> 52:55.089
What about the heavy-graviton beam
we were talking about?

52:55.548 --> 52:57.049
I've gone over it four times.

52:57.216 --> 53:00.344
The local-field distortion just wouldn't
be strong enough to incapacitate them.

53:00.678 --> 53:03.598
Dr. Crusher and I have been
working on an interesting premise.

53:04.098 --> 53:06.184
With our recent experience
in nanotechnology,

53:06.350 --> 53:10.146
we might be able to introduce
destructive nanites into the Borg.

53:10.313 --> 53:12.481
- Nanites?
DATA: Robots.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.442
Small enough to enter living cells.

53:14.609 --> 53:16.360
How long would it take
to execute that?

53:16.527 --> 53:18.529
That's the problem.
Two to three weeks.

53:18.696 --> 53:22.408
In two or three weeks, nanites
may be all that's left of the Federation.

53:22.909 --> 53:24.994
We have the new phaser adapters.

53:25.161 --> 53:27.288
Maybe, in concert
with the photon torpedoes,

53:27.455 --> 53:28.497
we can slow them down.

53:31.292 --> 53:33.544
I'm sure Captain Picard
would have something meaningful

53:33.836 --> 53:36.214
and inspirational to say right now.

53:36.881 --> 53:39.550
To tell you the truth, I wish he was
here, because I'd like to hear it too.

53:40.593 --> 53:44.430
I know how difficult this transition
has been for all of you.

53:44.597 --> 53:46.641
I can take over for him,

53:46.933 --> 53:49.936
but I could never replace
Captain Picard, nor would I ever try.

53:51.395 --> 53:52.563
Whatever the outcome,

53:53.648 --> 53:59.278
I'm sure our efforts in the coming
battle will justify his faith in all of us.

54:00.488 --> 54:02.240
Dismissed.

54:15.544 --> 54:16.671
What would you do?

54:18.923 --> 54:20.049
[DOOR CHIMES]

54:20.216 --> 54:21.634
Come.

54:26.639 --> 54:29.016
- May I speak to you, captain?
- Actually, Guinan, I--

54:29.183 --> 54:31.894
You know, Picard and I
used to talk every now and then,

54:32.061 --> 54:34.355
when one of us needed to.

54:38.359 --> 54:41.946
I guess I'm just used to
having the captain's ear.

54:43.281 --> 54:44.573
What's on your mind?

54:46.367 --> 54:49.287
I've heard a lot of people talking
down in Ten-Forward.

54:49.453 --> 54:51.998
They expect to be dead
in the next day or so.

54:53.124 --> 54:55.626
They trust you, they like you,

54:56.585 --> 54:58.963
but they don't believe
anyone can save them.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.632
I'm not sure anyone can.

55:03.467 --> 55:06.554
When a man is convinced
he's going to die tomorrow,

55:06.846 --> 55:09.390
he'll probably find a way
to make it happen.

55:10.474 --> 55:13.352
The only one
who can turn this around is you.

55:13.519 --> 55:15.313
I'll do the best I can.

55:15.896 --> 55:18.858
You're gonna have to do something
you don't want to do:

55:20.484 --> 55:22.528
You have to let go of Picard.

55:24.113 --> 55:28.326
Maybe you haven't heard.
I tried to kill him yesterday.

55:28.617 --> 55:31.162
You tried to kill
whatever that is on the Borg ship,

55:31.329 --> 55:33.164
not Picard.

55:36.834 --> 55:41.213
Picard is still here with us.
In this room.

55:41.380 --> 55:45.176
If he had died, it would be easier.
But he didn't.

55:45.343 --> 55:48.888
They took him from us,
a piece at a time.

55:50.264 --> 55:52.600
Did he ever tell you
why we're so close?

55:53.851 --> 55:57.104
- No.
- Oh.

55:57.855 --> 56:03.652
Then let me just say that
our relationship is beyond friendship.

56:03.986 --> 56:06.030
Beyond family.

56:06.530 --> 56:11.869
And I will let him go.
And you must do the same.

56:12.078 --> 56:14.330
There can only be one captain.

56:14.497 --> 56:15.664
It's not that simple.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.667
This was his crew.
He wrote the book on this ship.

56:18.834 --> 56:20.878
If the Borg know
everything he knows,

56:21.045 --> 56:23.756
it's time to throw that book away.

56:24.048 --> 56:26.717
You must let him go, Riker.

56:27.218 --> 56:29.470
It's the only way to beat him.

56:29.887 --> 56:32.098
The only way to save him.

- The Borg will be prepared for it.

Mr. Gleason, can you pinpoint
the source of the Borg transmission?

1:00:42.181 --> 1:00:44.224
I can put you

1:00:47.353 --> 1:00:49.897
The Borg have adapted

1:00:52.149 --> 1:00:54.360

Prepare to draw their fire.

1:06:15.555 --> 1:06:18.976

- His DNA is being rewritten.
- Can you revive him?

1:06:39.246 --> 1:06:40.455
I'd like more time

1:06:40.789 --> 1:06:43.250

on the motor pathways.

We don't have more time, doctor.

1:06:45.168 --> 1:06:48.755
Once he was wired into the Borg,
they knew everything that he knew.

1:06:48.922 --> 1:06:51.091
I just hope it goes both ways.

1:06:51.258 --> 1:06:52.342
If we're lucky,

1:06:52.509 --> 1:06:55.095
he had access to everything
we need to know about them.

1:06:55.512 --> 1:06:58.056
Especially their vulnerabilities.

It's Beverly. Can you hear me?

Beverly.

1:07:18.410 --> 1:07:20.203
Crusher, doctor.

1:07:21.788 --> 1:07:25.542
Yes. Don't try to move.

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:31.131
- I am on board the Enterprise.
- That's right.

1:07:36.970 --> 1:07:38.805
A futile maneuver.

1:07:38.972 --> 1:07:41.892
Incorrect strategy, Number One.

1:07:42.476 --> 1:07:47.481
To risk your crew and ship
to retrieve only one man.

1:07:47.898 --> 1:07:50.484
Picard would never have approved.

1:07:51.109 --> 1:07:58.492
You underestimate us if you believe
this abduction is any concern.

1:08:02.496 --> 1:08:07.501
There is no need for apprehension.
I intend no harm.

1:08:08.835 --> 1:08:10.170
No harm.

1:08:11.505 --> 1:08:16.551
I will continue aboard this ship
to speak for the Borg,

1:08:16.843 --> 1:08:22.766
while they continue without further
diversion to Sector 001,

1:08:22.933 --> 1:08:26.853
where they will force
your unconditional surrender.

1:08:34.528 --> 1:08:36.488
Using multimodal reflection sorting,

1:08:36.822 --> 1:08:40.200
I have been able to detect
a complex series of subspace signals

1:08:40.367 --> 1:08:42.452
between Locutus and the Borg ship.

1:08:42.744 --> 1:08:44.371
That's how they're controlling him?

1:08:44.538 --> 1:08:46.998
It is not just a matter
of control, doctor.

1:08:47.165 --> 1:08:49.918
The signals are interactive
across a subspace domain

1:08:50.085 --> 1:08:52.337
similar to that of a transporter beam.

1:08:52.504 --> 1:08:54.923
I would hypothesize
that these frequencies

1:08:55.090 --> 1:08:57.551
form the basis of the Borg's
collective consciousness.

1:08:57.843 --> 1:09:00.053
- Can't we block them?
- Possibly.

1:09:00.220 --> 1:09:02.055
But as you may recall,
on several occasions,

1:09:02.222 --> 1:09:05.725
we have witnessed the Borg removing
key circuits from injured comrades,

1:09:05.892 --> 1:09:08.061
no doubt separating them
from the group consciousness.

1:09:08.228 --> 1:09:10.939
The injured Borg
immediately self-destructed.

1:09:11.106 --> 1:09:12.190
That is correct, sir.

1:09:12.357 --> 1:09:15.110
Cutting the link to Locutus
might be fatal to the captain.

1:09:16.778 --> 1:09:20.991
We have to find a way to reach him.
We must know what he knows.

1:09:21.158 --> 1:09:22.909
Without these interactive signals,

1:09:23.076 --> 1:09:26.872
it would only be a matter
of microsurgery. I could do it.

1:09:27.038 --> 1:09:29.332
But as long as these Borg implants
are functioning,

1:09:29.499 --> 1:09:33.128
there's no way I can separate
the man from the machine.

1:09:33.962 --> 1:09:38.925
Then perhaps there is a way
I can access the machine, doctor.

Worf.
Klingon species, a warrior race.

1:09:54.107 --> 1:09:59.529
- You, too, will be assimilated.
- The Klingon Empire will never yield.

1:09:59.863 --> 1:10:01.448
Why do you resist?

1:10:01.781 --> 1:10:05.493
We only wish to raise quality of life
for all species.

1:10:05.827 --> 1:10:11.041
- I like my species the way it is.
- A narrow vision.

You will become one with the Borg.

1:10:14.836 --> 1:10:18.882

while at each stage Chief O'Brien

Mr. Data, we have two minutes
to figure out what we can do with it.

1:16:11.818 --> 1:16:14.153

or unable to terminate

1:16:18.157 --> 1:16:22.328

1:16:42.348 --> 1:16:44.225
It is conceivable, sir.

1:16:44.392 --> 1:16:47.687

Sir, what command
shall I attempt to plant?

1:16:55.737 --> 1:17:00.450
Something straightforward,
like "Disarm your weapon systems."

1:17:00.617 --> 1:17:03.745
- Visual contact with the Borg.
- On-screen.

1:17:04.704 --> 1:17:05.747

Yes, sir.

1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:39.006
It's Captain Picard speaking,

Mr. Data, what the hell happened?

1:20:03.132 --> 1:20:07.261
I successfully planted a command
into the Borg collective consciousness.

1:20:07.428 --> 1:20:10.681
It misdirected them to believe
it was time to regenerate.

1:20:10.973 --> 1:20:14.185
In effect, I put them all to sleep.

that the Borg are asleep.

There are indications here
that their entire power net's

what the destruction of the Borg ship
will do to him.

1:21:42.565 --> 1:21:44.358
We should also consider
the advantages

1:21:44.525 --> 1:21:47.028

of the Borg and their vessel, sir.

1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:53.492

yourself from Captain Picard.

time for repairs?

They picked a fine officer
for the task force, commander.

We'll have the fleet back up
in less than a year.

1:23:44.687 --> 1:23:48.232
I imagine you'll have your choice
of any Starfleet command, sir.

Everyone is so concerned
