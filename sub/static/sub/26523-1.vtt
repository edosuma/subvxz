01:18.830 --> 01:21.332
<i>Twenty seconds to drop.</i>

01:22.625 --> 01:24.185
<i>Arm switch lite check.</i>

01:25.837 --> 01:27.881
<i>Brakes out, check.</i>

01:30.842 --> 01:32.135
<i>What's your mixing chambers?</i>

01:32.469 --> 01:35.680
<i>Real rough up here,
fluctuating a half degree on each side.</i>

01:35.889 --> 01:38.016
<i>I see that.</i>

01:39.642 --> 01:40.935
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

01:52.614 --> 01:55.992
<i>- Good on track, 15 seconds.</i>
- Huh?

03:25.999 --> 03:28.001
<i>Give us a visual estimate
of your location.</i>

03:30.336 --> 03:33.464
<i>Okay. 140,000 feet.
On your way down.</i>

03:41.639 --> 03:43.766
<i>Approaching 115,000 feet.</i>

03:44.475 --> 03:46.394
<i>Should be regaining
aerodynamic control.</i>

03:48.646 --> 03:49.772
<i>Right turn.</i>

03:56.905 --> 03:59.240
<i>We show you ballooning,
not turning.</i>

04:07.916 --> 04:10.752
<i>Altitude rising.
A lot more right.</i>

04:13.004 --> 04:14.923
<i>Neil, you're bouncing off
the atmosphere.</i>

04:20.803 --> 04:22.847
<i>The altitude's still rising, Neil.</i>

05:24.367 --> 05:26.703
<i>You're gonna have to
stretch out your glide.</i>

05:30.915 --> 05:32.500
<i>You seem to be a tad short.</i>

05:40.425 --> 05:42.176
<i>Stow your flaps down, Neil.</i>

06:07.618 --> 06:09.370
I'm down.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.083
<i>Roger.</i>

06:43.780 --> 06:45.114
You okay?

06:48.826 --> 06:49.869
Yeah.

06:50.787 --> 06:52.121
Okay, Neil.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.169
Kid's a good engineer.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.171
But he's distracted.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.173
He got home, Chuck.

07:02.298 --> 07:04.978
He bounced off the atmosphere
and still figured out how to get home.

07:05.051 --> 07:06.469
Third mishap
this month.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.763
Bikle should ground him
before he hurts himself.

07:52.098 --> 07:54.225
There you go.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.227
It's okay.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.729
It's okay, sweetheart.

08:14.996 --> 08:16.289
What's that?

08:20.543 --> 08:22.086
Look. Who's that?

08:29.218 --> 08:30.678
Is that a kite?

08:32.638 --> 08:34.472
Does that fly in the sky?

08:34.640 --> 08:35.640
Yeah.

08:36.601 --> 08:37.977
How?

08:41.022 --> 08:42.732
<i>I see the moon</i>

08:44.358 --> 08:47.445
<i>The moon sees me</i>

08:48.029 --> 08:53.993
<i>Down through the leaves
of the old oak tree</i>

08:55.161 --> 09:01.042
<i>Please let the light that
shines on me</i>

09:02.877 --> 09:07.882
<i>Shine on the one I love</i>

09:09.091 --> 09:11.469
<i>Maybe I should talk to
Dr. Johns about it.</i>

09:12.261 --> 09:13.262
<i>Who?</i>

09:13.346 --> 09:15.139
Dr. Harold Johns.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.517
He developed a procedure
in Saskatchewan.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.561
<i>So you'd go to Canada?</i>

09:20.728 --> 09:22.772
I guess I would take
some time off.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.815
<i>Why don't you
talk to the hospital?</i>

09:24.982 --> 09:26.025
<i>See if the tumor might...</i>

09:26.108 --> 09:28.110
I spoke to them already.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.364
<i>I'm sorry, Neil.
I wish I had more to offer.</i>

09:31.864 --> 09:34.492
- That's okay, Jack. Appreciate it.
<i>- Of course.</i>

09:35.409 --> 09:37.536
- Give my love to June.
<i>- You got it.</i>

09:37.620 --> 09:39.705
- Okay, bye now.
<i>- Bye.</i>

09:58.641 --> 10:00.768
Now, who made that?
You or Grace?

10:00.851 --> 10:01.936
Grace did.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.896
I'll take it, then.

10:03.980 --> 10:05.815
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:06.399 --> 10:07.719
Dick Day called
from Houston.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.235
He was asking after you.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.279
That about Gemini?

10:12.154 --> 10:15.283
They're looking for pilots
with a solid background in engineering.

10:16.242 --> 10:19.704
Well, maybe once
Karen starts feeling better.

10:20.538 --> 10:23.124
Just, you know,
I wouldn't wanna move her until then.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.129
Well, it would be nice
to keep you around.

10:28.838 --> 10:30.631
- Enjoy the casserole.
- Thank you.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.049
You're welcome.

10:34.218 --> 10:35.553
- Joe.
- Hey, Jan.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.555
You, uh, hanging in?

10:37.763 --> 10:39.640
Oh, you know.

10:41.559 --> 10:43.519
It's nice of you to come by.

10:43.728 --> 10:45.313
Of course.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.484
Night, now.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.274
Dad, wanna come play?

12:16.237 --> 12:18.239
I should, uh...

12:19.281 --> 12:21.534
I have to help your mother.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.790
I thought I might go to work.

13:57.046 --> 13:58.756
Okay.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.418
They're gonna use
VTOL technology.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.212
They don't even
have it figured out how to get there yet.

14:20.236 --> 14:21.737
I'm not gonna
waste my time on...

14:23.405 --> 14:24.740
Morning.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.118
Neil.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.955
You can take
a few days off, you know.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.208
I know.

14:34.750 --> 14:38.921
I'm just getting up to speed
on the new delta wing in the UK.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.508
Bikle canceled the trip.

14:44.385 --> 14:48.180
He wants you focused on writing
up the pilot report from your last flight.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.565
Am I grounded, Joe?

15:00.109 --> 15:02.278
Write up the report
on the bounce, okay?

16:01.545 --> 16:03.088
Civilian?

16:03.756 --> 16:06.091
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Me, too.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.219
- Elliot.
- Neil.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.140
Tough morning, huh?

16:13.432 --> 16:15.893
I barely lasted two minutes
in that ice bath.

16:16.769 --> 16:18.687
Of course, I suppose
NASA's more interested

16:18.771 --> 16:20.314
in the psychological reaction.

16:21.815 --> 16:27.196
Well, I think I made it
pretty clear that I thought it was cold.

16:30.574 --> 16:31.617
Armstrong.

16:33.994 --> 16:34.995
Good luck.

16:35.079 --> 16:36.121
And to you, too.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.294
Another egghead.

16:42.503 --> 16:45.063
<i>Neil, we've been chatting
with candidates about the program.</i>

16:45.339 --> 16:48.884
As you know, our decision
to forego direct ascent

16:49.009 --> 16:51.178
in favor of a lunar orbit
rendezvous approach

16:51.261 --> 16:52.554
to the eventual Moon mission

16:52.638 --> 16:54.056
has had a major impact
on Gemini.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.779
Do you have any thoughts
on that decision?

16:57.351 --> 17:00.312
Well, even considering
von Braun's initial criticism,

17:00.396 --> 17:04.525
it seems that the payload saved
by parking the primary vehicle in orbit

17:04.692 --> 17:07.819
and sending a smaller ship
down to the lunar surface

17:07.903 --> 17:09.655
is well worth
the resulting challenges.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.198
What do you see
as the challenges?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.367
Cislunar navigation, for one.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.910
And rendezvous and docking.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.829
Why do you think
spaceflight's important?

17:19.580 --> 17:25.337
I had a few, uh, opportunities
in the X-15 to observe the atmosphere.

17:26.088 --> 17:30.300
It was so thin,
such a small part of the Earth

17:30.384 --> 17:31.635
you could barely
see it at all.

17:31.719 --> 17:34.471
And when you're down here
in the crowd and you look up, it...

17:35.222 --> 17:37.891
It looks pretty big and you don't think
about it too much, but...

17:39.226 --> 17:44.064
When you get a different vantage point,
it changes your perspective.

17:45.691 --> 17:49.945
I don't know what
space exploration will uncover,

17:50.028 --> 17:55.367
but I don't think it'll be exploration
just for the sake of exploration.

17:55.701 --> 18:00.622
I think it'll be more the fact that
it allows us to see things

18:00.789 --> 18:04.668
that maybe we should've seen
a long time ago.

18:04.835 --> 18:09.381
But just haven't
been able to until now.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.344
- Does anyone have anything else?
- Yeah.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.638
Neil, I was sorry to hear
about your daughter.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.394
I'm sorry,
is there a question?

18:22.644 --> 18:23.645
Um...

18:24.730 --> 18:28.484
What I mean is,
uh, do you think it will have an effect?

18:32.738 --> 18:34.990
I think it would be

18:35.073 --> 18:37.826
unreasonable to assume that
it wouldn't have some effect.

18:40.204 --> 18:41.413
All right, Neil.

18:41.497 --> 18:43.290
Thank you. That's fine.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.169
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.053
Hello?

18:57.429 --> 18:58.639
Yeah, sure. Neil.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.142
- Hello?
- Can I go play outside?

19:02.559 --> 19:03.685
Yeah.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.064
Yes, sir.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.109
Thank you, sir.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.032
I got it.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.249
It's a fresh start.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.752
Are you sure?

19:30.337 --> 19:31.672
Yeah.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.053
Hey.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.973
It'll be an adventure.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.868
<i>Since the time
of Jules Verne,</i>

20:00.951 --> 20:04.079
<i>man has imagined
traveling to the Moon.</i>

20:04.246 --> 20:06.206
<i>The old idea
of how to get to the Moon</i>

20:06.290 --> 20:09.543
<i>was to send one spacecraft
all the way there and back.</i>

20:09.793 --> 20:13.088
<i>However, NASA engineers
have developed a modern approach.</i>

20:13.255 --> 20:18.260
<i>Where one rocket contains several ships
that will make the journey together.</i>

20:18.427 --> 20:20.262
<i>Just as Columbus
took a rowboat</i>

20:20.345 --> 20:23.098
<i>from the</i> Santa MarÃ­a
<i>to the shore of the New World.</i>

20:23.432 --> 20:25.934
<i>The astronauts will
take a smaller spacecraft</i>

20:26.018 --> 20:29.021
<i>from the mothership
down to the lunar surface.</i>

20:29.187 --> 20:31.773
<i>When it's time to return,
the smaller craft</i>

20:31.857 --> 20:33.525
<i>will lift off from the surface</i>

20:33.817 --> 20:37.779
<i>and dock with the mothership, which will
then power the crew back to Earth.</i>

20:38.030 --> 20:40.741
<i>Thus, thanks to the brilliant
minds of NASA,</i>

20:40.824 --> 20:43.201
<i>the age-old dream
of going to the Moon</i>

20:43.327 --> 20:45.203
<i>will soon be achieved.</i>

20:54.004 --> 20:56.298
<i>Sputnik, Sputnik 2...</i>

20:56.548 --> 20:58.091
<i>Vostok...</i>

20:58.175 --> 20:59.343
Gagarin.

20:59.593 --> 21:03.263
The Soviets have beaten us
at every single major space accomplishment.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.182
Our program couldn't compete.

21:05.849 --> 21:08.226
So we've chosen to focus
on a job so difficult,

21:08.310 --> 21:10.896
requiring so many
technological developments,

21:11.355 --> 21:14.358
that the Russians are gonna
have to start from scratch.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.193
As will we.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.157
- Hi. I'm Pat.
- Hi.

21:22.324 --> 21:25.410
Got here about a week before you,
so welcome to the neighborhood.

21:25.494 --> 21:27.829
Oh, that's so nice of you.

21:27.913 --> 21:29.081
I'm Janet.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.999
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.961
So, instead of here,
we go...

21:55.148 --> 21:56.149
Here.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.443
That's to scale. Check it.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.112
That's my husband, Ed.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.823
And that's Eddie Junior.
I don't know where Bonnie is.

22:03.281 --> 22:04.783
- You've got two?
- I do.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.577
- I see... Is this your first one?
- Oh.

22:07.661 --> 22:10.122
No, no.
We've got a boy, Rick.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.832
How old is he?

22:11.957 --> 22:13.250
He's five and a half.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.740
Oh, we should
get them together.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.420
If we wanna
get this done,

22:16.628 --> 22:19.172
we need to prove
that two ships can find each other in orbit

22:19.256 --> 22:20.966
and dock without crashing.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.844
That's the primary mission
of Project Gemini.

22:24.261 --> 22:25.470
When we think you're ready,

22:25.554 --> 22:28.640
each of you will be assigned
a flight with a specific task.

22:28.890 --> 22:32.310
Only after we master
all these tasks do we move on to Apollo.

22:32.728 --> 22:34.354
Consider trying to land
on the Moon.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.165
- It's nice to meet you.
- And you, Pat.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.482
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.985
Eddie! Put that down.

22:40.277 --> 22:41.528
<i>Gus...</i>

22:41.903 --> 22:43.238
You got anything to add?

22:44.364 --> 22:45.866
Just do your job.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.704
Almost to scale.

22:51.204 --> 22:56.001
The Multi-Axis Trainer was designed
to replicate roll coupling on three axes.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.795
The kind you might
encounter in space.

23:00.130 --> 23:04.801
The challenge is to stabilize
the machine before you pass out.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.221
First victim, Armstrong.

24:54.661 --> 24:55.871
White, you're up.

24:56.121 --> 24:57.622
Yeah, I got it.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.040
I'm okay.

25:02.377 --> 25:03.545
Let's go again.

25:29.196 --> 25:30.780
Oh, fuck.

25:46.671 --> 25:48.840
Gentlemen, welcome to
Basic Rocket Physics.

25:49.257 --> 25:51.593
We'll just be covering
the first chapter tonight.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.513
When using a multi-stage
launch vehicle,

25:55.680 --> 25:59.684
it's necessary to determine
what the right sizing is of those stages.

26:38.556 --> 26:39.849
Hi.

26:40.016 --> 26:41.309
Hi.

26:44.354 --> 26:45.438
You okay?

26:45.814 --> 26:47.440
Yeah.

26:47.524 --> 26:50.902
Just thinking about this lecture.
It's kinda neat.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.740
What's neat about it?

26:57.742 --> 26:58.785
Well,

26:59.035 --> 27:02.080
it was about how to
rendezvous with the Agena.

27:02.455 --> 27:05.208
If you thrust,
it actually slows you down

27:05.292 --> 27:06.852
because it puts you
into a higher orbit,

27:06.918 --> 27:09.671
so you have to reduce thrust
and drop into a lower orbit

27:09.838 --> 27:11.214
in order to catch up.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.425
It's backwards from
what they teach you as a pilot.

27:13.508 --> 27:17.846
But if you work the math,
it... It follows.

27:19.681 --> 27:20.974
It's kinda neat.

27:23.310 --> 27:24.436
Yeah.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.146
What's funny?

27:26.354 --> 27:28.315
No, it's not funny.
It's just...

27:31.026 --> 27:32.610
It's kinda neat.

27:56.301 --> 27:58.011
Do you remember this?

27:59.804 --> 28:00.972
Yeah.

28:01.639 --> 28:03.558
I'm surprised that
you remember it.

29:03.952 --> 29:04.994
Great. Thank you.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.704
Thank you
for having us.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.182
It's a pleasure.

29:08.206 --> 29:09.624
Carrie.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.227
Here you go.
Would you like some salad?

29:11.251 --> 29:13.920
- Thank you.
- That's a lovely piano, Pat. Do you play?

29:14.003 --> 29:16.214
- Bonnie's taking lessons.
- Mmm.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.550
Well, perhaps we'll sing
for our supper.

29:20.635 --> 29:21.845
Neil plays piano?

29:22.011 --> 29:23.847
Neil knows
all kinds of show tunes.

29:24.097 --> 29:25.598
- Janet...
- Oh, come on.

29:25.682 --> 29:27.201
He was musical director
at his fraternity in college.

29:27.225 --> 29:28.309
Honey...

29:28.393 --> 29:30.246
Yeah, he wrote the musical
for the all-student revue.

29:30.270 --> 29:31.747
- I didn't write the music.
- Yeah, you did.

29:31.771 --> 29:35.108
No, we used music
from Gilbert and Sullivan.

29:35.275 --> 29:36.818
Well, he wrote
all-new lyrics.

29:37.527 --> 29:39.529
<i>The Land of Egelloc.</i>

29:40.029 --> 29:41.531
It was quite funny.

29:41.656 --> 29:44.659
<i>The Land of Egelloc?</i>

29:44.868 --> 29:46.119
- Egelloc.
- Mmm-hmm.

29:46.411 --> 29:47.579
You've never heard of it?

29:48.163 --> 29:49.247
I haven't.

29:49.414 --> 29:51.374
Oh, I'm surprised.
It's a distant land.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.668
But, uh, it's a magical place.

29:53.751 --> 29:55.295
It's "college"
spelled backwards.

29:59.007 --> 30:00.300
Seriously?

30:02.260 --> 30:03.344
Yep.

30:07.682 --> 30:10.477
- You're, uh, backup on 5, huh?
- Yeah.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.443
Don't worry, you'll get
your own mission soon.

30:13.146 --> 30:15.106
- How's training going on 4?
- It's good.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.524
I think we're close on EVA.

30:17.358 --> 30:18.776
First man to walk in space.

30:19.319 --> 30:20.487
That'd be something, huh?

30:20.653 --> 30:23.114
Yeah. Well, you know,
the walking's the easy part.

30:23.448 --> 30:25.450
It's getting back inside
that's tough.

30:25.617 --> 30:28.703
You know, it'd be a hell of
a ride to come back with my tail hanging out.

30:28.870 --> 30:31.664
Oh, I think McDivitt will cut the cord
before that ever happens.

30:31.748 --> 30:34.209
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You throttle back there, Armstrong.

30:34.292 --> 30:36.169
- Ed! Phone for you.
- Yeah?

30:36.252 --> 30:37.837
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's Deke.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.005
Okay, hang on.

30:39.172 --> 30:40.608
I think
that's Castor and Pollux.

30:41.716 --> 30:44.052
I was testing you. And you passed.

30:44.969 --> 30:46.572
I thought about
letting it fly, but...

30:46.596 --> 30:47.680
Yeah.

30:52.727 --> 30:54.771
No, I'll turn it on
right now.

30:55.563 --> 30:56.689
Hey, guys.

30:56.981 --> 30:59.210
<i>With a Soviet
pressure suit, we're told,</i>

30:59.234 --> 31:01.194
<i>that was designed
for the lunar surface.</i>

31:01.361 --> 31:02.487
I'll call you back.

31:02.654 --> 31:06.407
<i>This is, of course, mankind's first EVA,
or extravehicular activity.</i>

31:06.574 --> 31:08.409
<i>Within the American
space program,</i>

31:08.576 --> 31:13.039
<i>EVA is seen as one of the crucial tests
the astronauts must master</i>

31:13.206 --> 31:16.543
<i>if they are to successfully
carry out their mission to the Moon.</i>

31:17.043 --> 31:19.837
<i>Astronaut Ed White
was scheduled to perform</i>

31:19.963 --> 31:22.882
<i>the first EVA during Gemini 4.</i>

31:23.258 --> 31:25.176
<i>So this is yet
another major victory</i>

31:25.260 --> 31:28.221
<i>for the Soviet Union
in the Space Race.</i>

31:38.147 --> 31:39.607
<i>We got it from here.</i>

31:40.942 --> 31:42.318
Thanks, Elliot.

31:50.326 --> 31:51.578
<i>Eight days up there.</i>

31:51.786 --> 31:54.080
To be honest, I'm kinda glad
we didn't get this one.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.374
Hope they don't
kill each other.

31:58.543 --> 32:00.753
At least it'd be quieter around here.

32:09.887 --> 32:11.055
Neil!

32:13.891 --> 32:15.977
Neil Armstrong,
our backup commander.

32:16.227 --> 32:17.312
Buzz Aldrin.

32:17.395 --> 32:18.438
Roger Chaffee.

32:18.521 --> 32:21.649
Couple of greenhorns from third group.
They'll be at blockhouse for launch.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.110
Listen, can I speak to you
for a minute?

32:24.193 --> 32:25.320
Fellas.

32:30.575 --> 32:33.119
We're putting you
in command of Gemini 8.

32:33.286 --> 32:34.746
Dave Scott is gonna be
your pilot.

32:35.830 --> 32:38.791
We get the Agena back online.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.544
You're probably gonna be
the first to dock.

32:48.426 --> 32:51.179
Don't worry about Elliot.
We'll put that brain of his to work.

32:51.429 --> 32:55.350
We've got a big EVA planned for 8.
Dave's a workhorse.

32:56.643 --> 32:57.644
Yes, sir.

32:57.852 --> 32:59.896
- I'll talk to you later today.
- Thank you.

33:12.116 --> 33:16.037
My eye! My eye!

33:17.330 --> 33:18.831
Mr. Armstrong.

33:19.957 --> 33:21.292
When'd you
start swimming?

33:21.459 --> 33:23.437
I don't remember
exactly, but I think school.

33:23.461 --> 33:24.545
In high school?

33:24.629 --> 33:28.508
Yeah. And we had a...
We had a summer house in northern Wisconsin

33:28.591 --> 33:30.885
and I just used to
go to the lake and fish

33:30.968 --> 33:33.429
and I just used to swim
for miles and miles.

33:33.513 --> 33:34.764
I've always loved it.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.019
Nothing quite compares
to your terrible life.

33:44.774 --> 33:45.858
You got it comin'.

33:51.406 --> 33:53.991
It's the longest bridge
in the world, but...

33:54.075 --> 33:56.261
It's the second-largest
suspension bridge in the world

33:56.285 --> 33:58.365
but these cables are the longest.

33:59.622 --> 34:01.207
- Hey, Ed.
- Oh, hi.

34:01.374 --> 34:03.042
Can I speak with Neil?

34:03.334 --> 34:06.087
Yeah, sure. Why don't you come on in?
You're soaked.

34:06.629 --> 34:09.632
No, I'll...
I'll wait here. Thanks.

34:11.426 --> 34:12.527
You could fly
under there.

34:12.552 --> 34:14.344
That would hurt
if you jumped under it.

34:15.012 --> 34:18.725
- What's that?
- That would hurt if you jumped over it.

34:19.475 --> 34:20.726
Yeah.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.061
Uh, here are
the sky pieces...

34:22.145 --> 34:23.563
Neil. Ed's outside.

34:24.147 --> 34:26.315
Okay. Excuse me, son.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.402
Hi.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.404
Do you wanna come in?

34:31.571 --> 34:33.489
Some bad news about Elliot.

34:37.994 --> 34:40.079
No, I know.
Deke told me he bumped him, but...

34:40.163 --> 34:43.248
Neil, Elliot and Charlie
were flying into St. Louis this morning.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.793
Their T-38 crashed
on approach.

34:51.174 --> 34:52.175
Oh.

34:57.513 --> 34:59.265
There was a lot of fog.

35:13.905 --> 35:16.699
So did you really fly
under that bridge?

35:22.455 --> 35:24.248
Was it fun?

35:25.458 --> 35:27.168
Were you scared?

35:27.627 --> 35:28.878
Ricky.

35:29.337 --> 35:30.379
Honey.

35:30.463 --> 35:33.090
Why don't you go
and get your homework so I can check it?

35:33.257 --> 35:34.258
Yes, ma'am.

35:40.807 --> 35:42.183
Who was it?

35:52.610 --> 35:53.611
Shit.

35:54.445 --> 35:55.947
How the hell
did this happen?

35:56.656 --> 35:57.657
Mmm.

35:57.907 --> 36:00.576
Cernan told me cloud cover
was down to 500 feet.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.870
Probably never
saw the building.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.914
Clearly, the error
was the approach.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.999
He was coming in too slow
to reach the runway.

36:12.046 --> 36:13.297
What?

36:15.550 --> 36:19.637
You know Deke had his doubts about him,
that's why he moved Elliot off 8.

36:20.888 --> 36:22.765
Deke gave Elliot
his own command.

36:23.474 --> 36:26.519
Elliot wasn't aggressive enough.
You of all people have to know that.

36:26.602 --> 36:28.062
No, I don't.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.274
I didn't investigate
the crash.

36:32.191 --> 36:36.028
I didn't study the flight trajectory.
And I wasn't the one flying the plane.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.739
So I wouldn't
pretend to know anything.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.496
We'll never be 100% sure.

37:33.210 --> 37:34.795
Can we go?

37:35.296 --> 37:36.297
Uh...

37:37.256 --> 37:39.967
Not right now.
I wanna help Marilyn clear all this up.

37:40.051 --> 37:42.386
I don't wanna have her do it
after we're gone.

37:48.392 --> 37:49.435
Neil?

37:58.194 --> 37:59.570
I'm sorry.

38:00.071 --> 38:01.864
- I hate to be a bother.
- Oh.

38:01.948 --> 38:04.617
- Jan, it's no bother.
- Oh, Jan. Yeah, no.

38:05.910 --> 38:07.161
Neil's, uh...

38:12.208 --> 38:15.044
There was a year
when we were at Edwards...

38:15.252 --> 38:16.712
Four pilots died.

38:20.967 --> 38:23.302
We got good at funerals
that year.

38:25.054 --> 38:26.931
We haven't been to one
in a while.

38:30.726 --> 38:32.937
Does he ever talk to you
about Karen, Ed?

38:34.689 --> 38:37.316
Not really. No.

38:40.528 --> 38:42.697
Does he talk to you
about her?

38:43.781 --> 38:44.865
No.

38:47.493 --> 38:48.828
Never.

39:23.779 --> 39:24.947
Hey, buddy.

39:27.658 --> 39:29.410
You know,
you should be with Jan.

39:32.038 --> 39:33.718
Neil, you should be
playing with your kids.

39:33.956 --> 39:35.958
You know,
putting them into bed.

39:37.626 --> 39:39.907
- Times like these...
- Do you think I'm standing out here

39:40.171 --> 39:43.132
in the backyard
'cause I wanna talk to somebody, Ed?

39:44.008 --> 39:45.468
I'm sorry?

39:47.970 --> 39:50.723
Do you think I left there
'cause I wanna talk to somebody?

48:42.296 --> 48:45.382
<i>Burn time, zero plus zero-five.</i>

48:46.967 --> 48:48.218
"Out of..."

48:48.343 --> 48:50.554
- Hi.
- Hey, Mom, can I get you anything?

48:52.931 --> 48:54.141
"Constant."

48:55.267 --> 48:59.563
<i>Thrusters forward.
Maneuver retrograde. Did you copy?</i>

48:59.855 --> 49:01.440
<i>Roger, Hawaii. Got it.</i>

49:01.732 --> 49:04.335
<i>This is Paul Haney at Gemini Control Houston.</i>

49:04.359 --> 49:06.903
<i>Our display chart shows
Gemini 8 in orbit.</i>

49:07.070 --> 49:10.198
<i>The crew will now attempt to find
the unmanned Agena spacecraft</i>

49:10.282 --> 49:11.950
<i>and dock with it.</i>

49:30.552 --> 49:32.220
- Burn end.
- Good burn.

49:46.443 --> 49:48.403
Shouldn't we have a visual
on the Agena by now?

49:52.991 --> 49:55.118
Houston, I think
we overdid it a little.

49:55.327 --> 49:56.487
We should have stopped early.

49:56.620 --> 49:57.621
<i>Roger.</i>

49:58.038 --> 50:00.332
8, stand by for a correction.

50:03.752 --> 50:05.170
FIDO, Flight.
How we doing?

50:05.337 --> 50:06.981
Okay, we got a solid
track on both vehicles.

50:07.005 --> 50:08.006
Calculating for the burn.

50:08.173 --> 50:10.467
FIDO, Agena, do you
have what you need from us?

50:10.550 --> 50:13.470
FIDO, did you copy that?

50:13.720 --> 50:15.514
Roger, Flight.
I copy.

50:15.764 --> 50:16.848
You guys getting this?

50:17.057 --> 50:19.184
We just have some ratty data
with the Gemini computer.

50:21.645 --> 50:23.271
Need the correction,
gentlemen, let's go.

50:23.563 --> 50:24.856
Sending it up now.

50:24.981 --> 50:27.919
- Okay, CAPCOM, let's get it up to them.
- This is Houston CAPCOM.

50:27.943 --> 50:29.337
We're gonna need you to
do another burn here

50:29.361 --> 50:31.279
very shortly,
so stand by to copy.

50:31.822 --> 50:35.325
GET B 0-3-0-3-4-1.

50:36.034 --> 50:40.205
Uh, Delta-V is
two seconds posigrade.

50:40.539 --> 50:41.540
Two feet...

50:41.623 --> 50:44.042
Uh, Delta-V is
two feet posigrade.

50:45.043 --> 50:47.504
<i>Uh, 8, do you copy?</i>

50:51.800 --> 50:54.010
- Mark.
<i>- Two feet posigrade...</i>

50:54.094 --> 50:56.030
Give that back, Mark. Give that back.
Put it back on the table.

50:56.054 --> 50:57.573
<i>That is correct.
Zero, zero, zero.</i>

50:57.597 --> 50:59.641
Honey. Give me it.
It's really important.

50:59.725 --> 51:01.285
<i>Let me know
what the results are.</i>

51:01.309 --> 51:03.103
Give that back to Mom
right now.

51:03.186 --> 51:04.479
<i>Do you copy?</i>

51:05.814 --> 51:07.734
Mark Armstrong,
if you don't give me that back...

51:07.858 --> 51:08.900
<i>8, do you copy?</i>

51:09.317 --> 51:10.819
I'm not joking, Mark.

51:11.403 --> 51:16.116
I'm getting a horrendous
20 to 25 feet per second down, Neil.

51:16.366 --> 51:18.368
I can't see
any possible reason for that.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.221
- Where are we on the plot?
- We're above it.

51:20.245 --> 51:22.265
- Right, but what does it look like if...
- I can't.

51:22.289 --> 51:25.500
I'm sorry. I have to...
I have to look at this.

51:25.584 --> 51:27.264
- Okay.
<i>- 8, can you give us a status?</i>

51:27.544 --> 51:29.880
No. I got too much to do.

51:30.213 --> 51:31.673
<i>Copy. Standing by.</i>

51:34.760 --> 51:36.678
Okay, we're gonna go
with a closed loop.

51:37.179 --> 51:38.346
Twenty-five forward,

51:38.555 --> 51:40.974
eight left, three up.

51:41.892 --> 51:43.602
And I'm going
to rate command.

51:47.147 --> 51:49.816
Three, two, one,

51:49.900 --> 51:50.901
burn.

52:32.776 --> 52:33.944
Could be a planet.

52:34.778 --> 52:36.321
Could be.

52:41.660 --> 52:43.095
<i>This is Houston,
we have your ground</i>

52:43.119 --> 52:45.580
<i>TPI backup
when you're ready to copy.</i>

52:45.664 --> 52:47.833
Uh, stand by,
we have a visual on the Agena.

52:48.708 --> 52:51.169
<i>At least something
we think looks like the Agena.</i>

52:51.878 --> 52:54.923
<i>Understand,
possible visual on the Agena.</i>

52:55.465 --> 52:56.859
We're getting a little
out of plane now.

52:56.883 --> 52:59.928
Yeah. We gotta get three aft
and two and a half up.

53:00.011 --> 53:02.389
I'm gonna start braking.
Give me a digital range and rate.

53:08.186 --> 53:09.312
I better back off a bit.

53:09.604 --> 53:11.773
6,000 feet,
31 feet per second.

53:16.194 --> 53:18.697
- Put in a little to the left.
- 1,680 feet.

53:26.580 --> 53:28.373
That's unbelievable.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.625
Would you look at that?

53:40.385 --> 53:41.761
You tell 'em.

53:47.058 --> 53:50.812
Houston, we're station-keeping
on the Agena about 150 feet.

53:52.105 --> 53:55.066
Okay, stay focused, gentlemen.
We're only halfway there.

53:56.067 --> 53:57.569
Thanks for
the extra hands.

54:03.325 --> 54:04.910
Stay focused,
gentlemen.

54:26.473 --> 54:28.016
Man, it flies easy.

54:28.183 --> 54:29.893
Does it really?

54:30.393 --> 54:32.646
The station-keeping,
it's just...

54:32.896 --> 54:34.648
It's like nothing.

54:44.157 --> 54:45.825
Uh, RKV, this is 8.

54:46.409 --> 54:48.536
We're sitting about
two feet out.

54:49.412 --> 54:51.998
<i>Roger. Stand by
for a couple of minutes here.</i>

54:52.082 --> 54:53.166
Roger.

54:54.376 --> 54:57.212
<i>Okay, Gemini 8,
we have TM solid.</i>

54:57.295 --> 55:00.548
<i>You're looking good on the ground.
Go ahead and dock.</i>

55:17.357 --> 55:20.610
Okay, we're gonna cycle
our Rigid-Stop switch now.

55:45.760 --> 55:47.053
Flight, we are docked.

55:57.939 --> 55:59.816
Someone call Cronkite!

56:00.025 --> 56:02.444
Have him tell the Soviets
that they can go screw!

56:02.819 --> 56:04.463
Get him on the phone, man.

56:04.487 --> 56:07.699
Hey, Pete! Hey, call those idiots
at Congress while you're at it!

56:07.782 --> 56:09.617
Yeah, I'll start
with Rhode Island.

56:11.161 --> 56:13.371
Oh, damn.

56:13.872 --> 56:15.808
Well done.
Let's go ahead and get a state vector

56:15.832 --> 56:17.250
on the combined spacecraft.

56:17.500 --> 56:20.060
<i>Gemini 8, this is Houston CAPCOM.
Please stand by to copy.</i>

56:20.128 --> 56:21.880
Check out my room
like this.

56:21.963 --> 56:24.132
- Look at all these papers.
- I know.

56:24.632 --> 56:29.137
I spent days trying to work on that,
and now it's crumpled up.

56:29.596 --> 56:31.890
- Look at my drawer.
- I know.

56:32.057 --> 56:35.643
I had all my crayons in that,
and now look at all the crayons.

56:35.810 --> 56:37.455
But, Ricky, are you
telling me the full story?

56:37.479 --> 56:38.622
'Cause I'm not sure your
brother would do that.

56:38.646 --> 56:39.814
Yes, I am telling you!

56:39.898 --> 56:41.983
- Don't you get angry with me.
- Look at this!

56:43.151 --> 56:44.402
Don't get upset.

56:44.819 --> 56:46.019
<i>Uh, 8, this is Houston.</i>

56:46.362 --> 56:49.032
<i>Uh, I've got a nodal update
for you. Stand by.</i>

56:51.076 --> 56:52.952
<i>- Okay, go ahead.</i>
- Rick!

56:53.036 --> 56:55.205
<i>Roger.
Node 0-7-0-4-4-7...</i>

56:55.371 --> 56:58.249
Okay, out here now.
Out here now.

56:58.333 --> 57:00.877
<i>1-5-5-2
right ascension.</i>

57:01.044 --> 57:03.546
<i>Gemini 8, we're about
to have loss of signal.</i>

57:03.630 --> 57:06.216
<i>We'll pick you up
over the hill for Dave's EVA.</i>

57:14.557 --> 57:15.642
Well...

57:16.684 --> 57:18.061
That's peculiar.

57:18.686 --> 57:20.063
Oh, good.

57:20.522 --> 57:23.191
I'm hoping that's
just excess hydrogen.

57:23.691 --> 57:25.771
I think I'm gonna save mine for later.

57:25.944 --> 57:27.070
Little treat.

57:33.201 --> 57:34.577
Uh, Neil, we're in a bank.

57:41.918 --> 57:44.295
We're not doing it.
It's not us. It must be...

57:44.379 --> 57:46.214
Shut off
the Agena's control systems.

57:46.714 --> 57:48.133
Code 4-0-0...

57:48.299 --> 57:49.926
Agena control system
shut down.

58:14.242 --> 58:15.910
Cycle the Agena.

58:16.619 --> 58:19.122
Turning it on.
Turning it off.

58:43.730 --> 58:47.108
I'm gonna cycle the ACME
and the propellant motor valves.

58:48.151 --> 58:49.944
Switching ADL to pitch.

58:50.486 --> 58:51.738
RL to pitch.

58:58.620 --> 59:00.580
Roll meter
200 and rising.

59:03.666 --> 59:04.709
Separate from the Agena.

59:07.503 --> 59:09.839
Setting Agena
to allow remote command.

59:09.923 --> 59:11.591
Switching on the DAC.

59:11.674 --> 59:14.278
Make sure you give it extra thrust
so we don't smash into the Agena.

59:14.302 --> 59:15.887
On my mark, undock.

59:18.139 --> 59:19.307
Two...

59:19.766 --> 59:21.059
One...

59:36.366 --> 59:38.618
OAMS propellant, 13%.

59:38.743 --> 59:40.870
It's not the Agena. It's us.

01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:07.188
Gemini 8 coming back
into range in three, two, one.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.691
This is CSQ,
checking our comm link.

01:00:09.857 --> 01:00:11.359
How do you read?

01:00:14.195 --> 01:00:15.697
Gemini 8, how do you read?

01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:17.657
<i>We have
serious problems.</i>

01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:19.951
We're tumbling
end over end up here.

01:00:20.034 --> 01:00:21.577
We're disengaged
from the Agena.

01:00:22.996 --> 01:00:26.416
<i>Okay, we got your spacecraft
free indication here.</i>

01:00:26.582 --> 01:00:28.126
<i>What seems to be the problem?</i>

01:00:28.376 --> 01:00:30.545
We're rolling up and we can't
turn anything off.

01:00:30.712 --> 01:00:32.672
We're continuously
increasing in a left roll.

01:00:33.423 --> 01:00:34.424
<i>CSQ, Flight.</i>

01:00:34.507 --> 01:00:35.508
Go ahead, Flight.

01:00:35.717 --> 01:00:38.720
Did he say he cannot
turn the Agena off?

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:41.431
<i>No, he says he's
separated from the Agena</i>

01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:44.017
<i>and he's in a roll,
and he can't stop it.</i>

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.602
<i>Flight, their roll meter
reads 270 and rising.</i>

01:00:46.853 --> 01:00:50.273
<i>At that rate, they'll be passing out
in about 40 seconds.</i>

01:00:51.733 --> 01:00:52.900
Paul.

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:55.236
Paul.

01:00:57.864 --> 01:00:59.824
<i>Trying to stop
the rates.</i>

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:01.507
<i>We certainly have...</i>

01:01:38.363 --> 01:01:39.572
<i>You need to...</i>

01:01:43.326 --> 01:01:45.620
<i>Gemini 8, you need to...</i>

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:53.795
<i>We can't...</i>

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:17.443
Close the RCS breakers.

01:02:20.613 --> 01:02:21.697
Dave!

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:25.660
<i>Gemini 8, did you say
you are closing RCS breakers?</i>

01:02:27.036 --> 01:02:29.288
<i>Are you initiating RCS?</i>

01:02:30.706 --> 01:02:31.707
<i>Gemini 8...</i>

01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:35.670
<i>Again, did you say
you are closing RCS breakers?</i>

01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:38.798
<i>You will not be able
to control your attitude.</i>

01:03:05.658 --> 01:03:06.701
Okay.

01:03:06.993 --> 01:03:08.995
We're regaining control
of the spacecraft.

01:03:09.579 --> 01:03:10.913
Slowly in RCS direct.

01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:14.750
<i>Roger.</i>

01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:16.752
Roger. Copy.

01:03:16.836 --> 01:03:19.213
<i>We're pulsing the RCS slowly.
It's all roll right.</i>

01:03:20.173 --> 01:03:22.008
We're trying to kill
our roll rate here.

01:03:31.017 --> 01:03:32.894
Move us back to one ring.

01:03:33.478 --> 01:03:34.604
Copy.

01:03:45.364 --> 01:03:47.033
I want emergency
landing options.

01:03:47.116 --> 01:03:49.116
Wait until you find out
how much fuel there's left.

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:52.371
Bob, what do you think?

01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:55.124
I think they'd
better land now.

01:03:59.712 --> 01:04:00.755
Deke.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:02.548
Jan's outside.

01:04:18.314 --> 01:04:20.441
Jan, the ship is stable.
They're gonna be all right.

01:04:21.317 --> 01:04:22.527
He's okay, Jan.

01:04:22.735 --> 01:04:23.815
I need you
to go home.

01:04:23.903 --> 01:04:25.363
Fine. Turn the box back on.

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:26.697
I'll see what I can do...

01:04:26.781 --> 01:04:29.033
Now.
Turn the box back on now.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.929
Well, there's
security protocol that's...

01:04:31.953 --> 01:04:33.120
Well, I don't give a damn.

01:04:33.496 --> 01:04:35.376
I've got a dozen cameras
on my front lawn, Deke.

01:04:35.456 --> 01:04:37.176
Do you want me telling them
what's going on?

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:40.336
Jan, you have to trust us.
We've got this under control.

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:41.587
No, you don't.

01:04:41.671 --> 01:04:43.673
All these protocols
and procedures to make it

01:04:43.756 --> 01:04:45.758
seem like you have it
under control.

01:04:46.467 --> 01:04:49.637
But you're a bunch of boys
making models out of balsa wood.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.931
You don't have
anything under control!

01:04:56.894 --> 01:05:01.107
<i>Naha Rescue One
will be on station at splashdown.</i>

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:03.359
<i>With a flotation collar.</i>

01:05:03.568 --> 01:05:05.444
Did you get
the call signs?

01:05:06.362 --> 01:05:08.114
Uh, yeah.
It's Naha Rescue One

01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:09.699
and Naha Search One.

01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:16.372
Well, I'd like to argue with them
about the going home, but I'm

01:05:16.497 --> 01:05:19.083
not sure how we can.

01:05:20.126 --> 01:05:21.294
Yeah.

01:05:23.087 --> 01:05:27.592
I just keep thinking,
is there anything else that we forgot?

01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:31.470
We did everything,
as far as I know.

01:05:44.567 --> 01:05:49.238
<i>Gemini 8 saw two complex vehicles
launched on the same day on time.</i>

01:05:50.364 --> 01:05:52.825
We saw flawless rendezvous
and docking.

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:56.871
All of which is tended
to be overshadowed by the malfunction.

01:05:57.371 --> 01:06:02.668
But I think we should
focus on the progress resulting from the mission.

01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:06.964
The board would like to focus
on the malfunction.

01:06:07.048 --> 01:06:10.176
Neil, walk us through
the decision to separate from the Agena.

01:06:13.638 --> 01:06:17.141
You mentioned that the rate
of revolution was more than once a second.

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:18.870
How near were you
to being unconscious?

01:06:19.268 --> 01:06:21.997
Did you think to use
the Agena to stabilize the combined craft?

01:06:22.021 --> 01:06:23.230
We did.

01:06:23.856 --> 01:06:26.484
This was, uh,
not successful.

01:06:27.318 --> 01:06:28.861
As I said,
we initially assumed

01:06:28.944 --> 01:06:31.280
that the anomaly was with
the Agena control system.

01:06:31.697 --> 01:06:34.492
'Cause there was no way
to know that a thruster was causing the...

01:06:35.284 --> 01:06:40.206
If we could have, uh, isolated
each of Gemini's thrusters...

01:06:40.289 --> 01:06:42.009
If we'd had that capability
in the moment...

01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:44.919
Agence France.

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:48.547
Did you have any feeling of anxiety after
the failure of the thrusters?

01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:50.108
In the midst of the spinning,

01:06:50.132 --> 01:06:54.512
did you seem to realize or feel
the presence of God closer than other times?

01:06:54.887 --> 01:06:58.557
With this so hot on the heels
of the loss of Charlie Bassett and Elliot See,

01:06:58.641 --> 01:07:00.810
do you question whether
the program is worth the cost?

01:07:00.976 --> 01:07:02.186
In money and in lives?

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:15.980
All right,
thanks, guys.

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:18.911
We've got a lot to discuss
and we'll be back in touch with you soon.

01:07:19.453 --> 01:07:20.538
Thank you.

01:07:22.206 --> 01:07:23.846
Mmm-mmm.

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:27.211
- No. So, we're using our thumb now, honey.
- Oh.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.421
Okay.

01:07:32.425 --> 01:07:34.844
"Our Wild Ride In Space"?

01:07:34.927 --> 01:07:38.073
<i>It's marketing, Mr. Armstrong.
NASA approval numbers are dropping.</i>

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:39.265
That's not my concern.

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:40.474
Almost. Okay.

01:07:40.558 --> 01:07:43.144
I'm gonna finish wrapping your brother's present.
I'll be back.

01:07:43.227 --> 01:07:45.271
- You practice that one.
- I'll try.

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:50.443
I'm not interested
in how other magazines are framing the story.

01:08:04.457 --> 01:08:06.250
Okay. Keep going.

01:08:08.586 --> 01:08:11.630
<i>If it's any consolation,
Ed was a zombie for weeks after Gemini 4.</i>

01:08:12.047 --> 01:08:13.048
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:15.426 --> 01:08:20.055
Yeah. I guess it must be,
uh, disorienting for them.

01:08:20.473 --> 01:08:21.724
Certainly.

01:08:23.017 --> 01:08:24.100
Yeah.

01:08:26.687 --> 01:08:27.979
God, Pat.

01:08:29.774 --> 01:08:32.568
I married Neil
'cause I wanted a normal life.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:36.488
I know. I know.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.243
- He was just so different from all the other boys on campus.
- Hmm.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.622
He'd been through the war.
You know?

01:08:46.624 --> 01:08:48.167
He knew
what he wanted to do.

01:08:49.502 --> 01:08:51.127
He just seemed so stable.

01:08:54.173 --> 01:08:56.258
I guess all I wanted
was stability.

01:09:02.848 --> 01:09:04.850
I've got a sorority sister
with a normal life.

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.937
- Yeah?
- She married a dentist.

01:09:08.437 --> 01:09:11.314
Dentist. Sounds good.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.733
He's home by 6:00
every night.

01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:16.529
And every few months,
she calls to say she wishes he weren't.

01:09:24.703 --> 01:09:26.037
Yeah.

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:32.962
Still working, I see.

01:09:33.546 --> 01:09:34.546
Yeah.

01:09:35.464 --> 01:09:39.510
Well, I was gonna go
grab a beer at Dave's.

01:09:45.683 --> 01:09:47.184
Yeah, all right. Fine.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.769
I could use a beer.

01:09:57.403 --> 01:09:59.113
You know,
I will say one thing.

01:10:00.114 --> 01:10:01.782
It's all I can think about,

01:10:02.116 --> 01:10:03.409
is getting back up there.

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:06.203
Just caught a rough break.

01:10:06.745 --> 01:10:08.455
Well, you boys did
everything right.

01:10:09.164 --> 01:10:10.207
Everything.

01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:12.644
You know, I was talking about it with Gus,
and we both agreed.

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:16.171
I did hear a little rumor
that you and Gus have been hanging out.

01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:17.840
- You did?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:10:17.923 --> 01:10:18.924
Hey.

01:10:19.425 --> 01:10:20.593
Is it true?

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:23.137
Is what true?

01:10:26.974 --> 01:10:30.227
Deke pulled me aside and told me
that him and Gus want me on the crew.

01:10:32.062 --> 01:10:33.647
Of the first Apollo?

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:35.399
Yeah.

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:38.736
Yeah.
Holy shit, that's huge.

01:10:38.903 --> 01:10:40.446
Congratulations.

01:10:41.739 --> 01:10:43.157
I gotta shake your hand.

01:10:43.324 --> 01:10:44.366
Thanks, man.

01:10:44.533 --> 01:10:45.534
Wow.

01:10:45.701 --> 01:10:47.982
That Saturn's a monster,
you're in for one heck of a ride.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.246
It is.

01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:50.410
Oh, hey.

01:10:50.539 --> 01:10:53.584
You know Deke wants Gus
to be the first one on the Moon, so...

01:10:54.919 --> 01:10:57.588
Hey, that puts you in the LEM
with him for the landing.

01:10:57.755 --> 01:10:59.798
Oh, no.
Let's not get carried away.

01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:02.068
All right, get out of my house.
I gotta go to bed.

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:04.345
I'm not kidding, get out of my house.

01:11:07.139 --> 01:11:08.140
Neil.

01:11:09.892 --> 01:11:12.853
Hey, Neil. Don't bother sitting,
it's gonna be a short meeting.

01:11:13.646 --> 01:11:16.732
We've talked it through, we think it's pretty clear.
If you hadn't kept cool,

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:19.502
you wouldn't be here and we'd
still be asking what the hell happened.

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:21.195
So would Congress.
It's a showstopper.

01:11:21.362 --> 01:11:22.655
This mission
was a success.

01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:24.615
We're full steam ahead
for Apollo.

01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:25.908
You good with that?

01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:27.952
Yes, sir.

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:30.537
I trust you won't mind representing us
at the White House.

01:11:32.831 --> 01:11:33.999
No, sir.

01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:35.250
Good.

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:36.835
Thank you.

01:11:36.919 --> 01:11:38.170
Thank you.

01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:40.506
Thank you.

01:11:40.881 --> 01:11:44.301
"Interface problems and
develop operational techniques

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:48.639
"for the most efficient use
of onboard capabilities."

01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:50.182
What?

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.940
I got one. I got one.

01:11:58.107 --> 01:12:00.067
- No!
- I got one.

01:12:00.234 --> 01:12:02.754
I don't know why you're laughing.
He's gonna do that to you in a minute.

01:12:02.778 --> 01:12:05.155
This time,
I'm gonna put this one in the freezer.

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:06.365
You need a hand?

01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:07.808
- Yeah.
- Okay, in you go.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:08.969
Can you open
the freezer?

01:12:08.993 --> 01:12:10.595
Let's keep him for
longer and then he won't...

01:12:10.619 --> 01:12:11.954
In you go.

01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:24.299
I got one.

01:12:24.675 --> 01:12:25.884
I got one.

01:12:26.301 --> 01:12:28.095
- Because I want to.
- Who did what?

01:12:28.262 --> 01:12:30.389
- Me.
- Have you seen his room?

01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:32.224
Son, go stand in the corner.

01:12:37.271 --> 01:12:38.939
It's not funny.

01:12:42.026 --> 01:12:43.652
Thanks a lot, Mark!

01:12:43.736 --> 01:12:45.463
- Stop laughing.
- You're lying!

01:12:45.487 --> 01:12:47.007
- Punish him.
- Just you stop it.

01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:48.866
You're the reason he's upset.

01:12:48.949 --> 01:12:50.468
Your mother's not laughing,
she's crying.

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:52.786
I'm not laughing,
I'm crying.

01:12:57.207 --> 01:12:58.751
<i>I gotta tell you.</i>

01:12:59.168 --> 01:13:02.212
<i>Eddie's started asking questions
about the new command module.</i>

01:13:02.755 --> 01:13:04.339
<i>- Is that right?
- Yeah.</i>

01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:07.593
He wants to know
if it's gonna fly any different to Gemini.

01:13:08.052 --> 01:13:10.804
If the little buttons are gonna be
in the same place.

01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:13.223
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

01:13:13.599 --> 01:13:15.768
You got yourself
a little engineer there.

01:13:16.518 --> 01:13:17.853
I tell you, though,

01:13:18.353 --> 01:13:20.064
I love that he's interested.

01:13:22.775 --> 01:13:25.444
Came in the other morning,
he did.

01:13:25.611 --> 01:13:28.155
Comes runnin' up
and he says, "Daddy,

01:13:28.906 --> 01:13:31.658
"if you go to the Moon,
are you gonna be lonely out there?

01:13:31.867 --> 01:13:34.036
"So far away from the Earth.

01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:38.999
"All of us back here at home."

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:44.546
This whole thing is
expanding his horizons.

01:13:46.673 --> 01:13:48.550
It, uh, gives me faith.

01:13:50.344 --> 01:13:51.970
It make sense?

01:13:55.974 --> 01:13:58.644
Walkers got a new swing set.

01:14:00.562 --> 01:14:02.106
Yeah, I noticed that.

01:14:12.324 --> 01:14:16.703
We had a swing like that
back up in Juniper Hills.

01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:22.876
Karen really loved it.

01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:28.257
That's your daughter?

01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:39.643
Guess I ought to be
gettin' home.

01:15:30.652 --> 01:15:31.987
<i>Closing hatches now.</i>

01:15:39.203 --> 01:15:40.537
Okay, that's all of 'em.

01:15:40.621 --> 01:15:41.705
<i>Thanks, Ed.</i>

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.210
<i>Ablative hatch closed.</i>

01:15:46.919 --> 01:15:49.171
<i>Closing the boost
protective cover.</i>

01:15:50.797 --> 01:15:52.549
<i>And plugs out.</i>

01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:04.144
Ready for oxygen purge.

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:18.825
Guys, you wanna hold down the chatter?
We're on open mic.

01:16:18.992 --> 01:16:20.702
<i>Let's hold
the countdown.</i>

01:16:24.748 --> 01:16:26.625
<i>Sorry, guys,
we'll get this squared.</i>

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:28.710
Shit, we're gonna be
here all night.

01:16:28.877 --> 01:16:30.212
<i>Gus, we didn't get that.</i>

01:16:30.379 --> 01:16:31.588
'Course you didn't.

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:36.677
Glad you think
this is funny.

01:16:43.934 --> 01:16:45.477
We finished strong
with Gemini

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.813
and we're very, very bullish
on Apollo, Senator.

01:16:47.896 --> 01:16:50.732
I should hope so,
given the time we've spent developing it.

01:16:50.816 --> 01:16:53.026
Half the country doesn't think
it's worth it anymore.

01:16:53.235 --> 01:16:54.486
Uh, well,

01:16:55.946 --> 01:16:59.700
we learned to fly
only 60 years ago,

01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:04.746
so if you consider the technological developments
in the context of history...

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:08.041
I'm considering it
in the context of taxpayer dollars.

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:09.584
And so are we, Senator.

01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:13.338
Between us, we're doing some final tests
on the new command module today.

01:17:13.547 --> 01:17:15.966
I'm sure Mr. Gilruth would be
happy to tell you about it.

01:17:16.091 --> 01:17:17.926
Let me introduce you to Bob.
Come on.

01:17:18.093 --> 01:17:19.219
Okay.

01:17:39.573 --> 01:17:41.373
Well, I haven't talked yet.
How's this?

01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:43.785
One, two, three, four, five,

01:17:44.411 --> 01:17:46.496
four, three, two, one.

01:17:53.587 --> 01:17:56.214
<i>Uh, we need another
minute to get it sorted.</i>

01:17:56.673 --> 01:18:00.135
How are we gonna get to the Moon
if we can't talk between three buildings?

01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:02.846
They can't hear a thing
you're saying.

01:18:04.139 --> 01:18:05.682
Jesus Christ.

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:06.850
<i>Say again?</i>

01:18:07.017 --> 01:18:08.369
I said, how are we gonna
get to the Moon

01:18:08.393 --> 01:18:10.273
if we can't talk between
two or three buildings?

01:18:12.647 --> 01:18:14.066
You tell 'em, Gus.
You tell 'em.

01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:15.400
Mickey Mouse shit.

01:18:15.484 --> 01:18:18.028
<i>I got a surge
in the AC bus two voltage.</i>

01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:21.177
<i>- Try resetting the meter.
- You getting this, Gus?</i>

01:18:22.157 --> 01:18:25.911
Rog, you picking anything up on the dials?

01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:37.506
Hey, we got a fire
in the cockpit.

01:18:43.387 --> 01:18:45.097
Hey, we got a bad fire!

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:51.436
We're burning up in here!

01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:05.826
Mr. Armstrong?
I have Deke Slayton on the phone for you.

01:19:06.034 --> 01:19:07.035
Oh.

01:19:07.369 --> 01:19:08.537
Right this way.

01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:18.004
Thank you.

01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:19.423
Well, I'm glad you called.

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:22.050
I'm not sure if I'm helping
or hurting over here.

01:19:22.217 --> 01:19:24.636
<i>Neil, we had a problem
with the plugs-out test.</i>

01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:27.681
Well, that's why
we have tests, right?

01:19:27.848 --> 01:19:29.349
We'll figure it out.

01:19:29.516 --> 01:19:31.059
<i>There was a fire.</i>

01:19:32.769 --> 01:19:35.272
<i>God, there's no easy way
to say this.</i>

01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:37.816
<i>Ed, Gus, and Roger...</i>

01:19:38.942 --> 01:19:40.318
<i>They're gone.</i>

01:19:45.282 --> 01:19:48.535
<i>We think it was a wiring issue.
A spark in all that oxygen.</i>

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:50.454
<i>It happened very quickly.</i>

01:19:50.579 --> 01:19:53.707
<i>Now, listen, we need you guys
to head back to the hotel.</i>

01:19:53.874 --> 01:19:55.417
<i>The press is gonna be
all over this.</i>

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:58.086
<i>Congress is gonna be
calling for investigations.</i>

01:19:58.587 --> 01:20:01.631
<i>We just don't want you guys
in the middle of all that.</i>

01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:05.093
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:20:06.928 --> 01:20:08.096
Yeah.

01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:12.058
<i>All right, then.</i>

01:20:14.936 --> 01:20:16.271
Okay.

01:20:47.511 --> 01:20:51.056
<i>A lot of people forget about
the influence that the lunar program has</i>

01:20:51.139 --> 01:20:53.517
<i>on the raising of our young
people in the country.</i>

01:20:53.767 --> 01:20:55.936
<i>I think that if a civilization
doesn't look out,</i>

01:20:56.019 --> 01:20:58.688
<i>if it doesn't try to
expand its horizons,</i>

01:20:58.772 --> 01:21:02.150
<i>then we're not going
to progress as a nation.</i>

01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:05.704
<i>At 10:30 tonight,
Eastern Time,</i>

01:21:05.737 --> 01:21:09.115
<i>rescue teams began to remove
the bodies of the three astronauts</i>

01:21:09.199 --> 01:21:11.576
<i>from the charred spacecraft.</i>

01:21:11.743 --> 01:21:16.039
<i>A NASA spokesman said the dead astronauts
were left in the ship for four hours</i>

01:21:16.122 --> 01:21:18.792
<i>to aid the investigation
into the tragedy.</i>

01:21:20.085 --> 01:21:22.420
<i>And according to the latest
information from NASA</i>

01:21:22.504 --> 01:21:24.464
<i>at the Manned Spacecraft
Center in Houston,</i>

01:21:24.548 --> 01:21:28.176
<i>the first Apollo flight,
which was scheduled for February...</i>

01:21:40.355 --> 01:21:43.275
<i>Winds are pretty rough today.
Keep an eye on your yaw.</i>

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.443
Copy. Correcting.

01:21:56.204 --> 01:21:57.330
1,000 feet.

01:21:57.497 --> 01:21:58.498
Switching to lunar mode.

01:22:02.127 --> 01:22:03.378
Final landing approach.

01:22:06.923 --> 01:22:08.341
<i>You're too low. Climb!</i>

01:22:11.011 --> 01:22:12.012
Control is degrading.

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:14.055
<i>Slow your rates.</i>

01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:16.725
<i>Do you read?</i>

01:22:17.434 --> 01:22:18.435
<i>Neil?</i>

01:23:22.916 --> 01:23:24.334
<i>The vehicle's not safe.</i>

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:26.670
Unfortunately, it's the best
simulation we have.

01:23:26.753 --> 01:23:28.338
And you and the others
are too valuable.

01:23:28.421 --> 01:23:30.149
It's a fly-by-wire system
that's got no backup.

01:23:30.173 --> 01:23:31.591
The ejection seat
is the backup.

01:23:31.675 --> 01:23:33.694
Political fallout
from another accident will compromise our...

01:23:33.718 --> 01:23:36.572
With all due respect, sir,
it's not my job to worry about the political fallout.

01:23:36.596 --> 01:23:38.491
- The damn thing could've killed you.
- Well, it didn't.

01:23:38.515 --> 01:23:40.266
A split second more
and you would not be...

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:41.434
Well, we need to fail.

01:23:41.518 --> 01:23:44.145
We need to fail down here,
so we don't fail up there.

01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:45.647
Okay, Neil, Neil.

01:23:46.272 --> 01:23:48.358
At what cost, huh?

01:23:49.317 --> 01:23:50.902
At what cost?

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:55.865
Well, it's a little bit late
for that question, isn't it, sir?

01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:06.018
<i>They raise their voices, their placards,</i>

01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:07.522
<i>and they march
against the government.</i>

01:24:07.585 --> 01:24:10.171
<i>But some go farther, burning
Selective Service cards</i>

01:24:10.338 --> 01:24:11.589
<i>and obstructing the draft.</i>

01:24:11.715 --> 01:24:15.385
<i>Most dissenters confine
themselves to this kind of protest activity.</i>

01:24:15.552 --> 01:24:18.680
<i>Hey! Hey! LBJ!
How many kids did you kill today?</i>

01:24:19.472 --> 01:24:23.643
<i>Hey! Hey! LBJ!
How many kids did you kill today?</i>

01:24:28.064 --> 01:24:29.190
Pat?

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:44.873
Pat?

01:24:46.708 --> 01:24:47.834
You okay?

01:24:48.168 --> 01:24:49.461
Yes.

01:25:07.687 --> 01:25:09.189
Why don't we go inside?

01:25:37.091 --> 01:25:38.092
Hi.

01:25:43.223 --> 01:25:44.766
Are you okay? Jesus!

01:25:45.183 --> 01:25:46.309
Oh, I'm fine.

01:25:46.559 --> 01:25:47.560
Look at your face.

01:25:47.685 --> 01:25:48.812
Excuse me.

01:25:52.565 --> 01:25:54.108
Dad, wanna come play?

01:25:54.359 --> 01:25:55.443
- Ricky.
- Uh...

01:25:56.152 --> 01:25:58.154
Boys, go on. Go on.

01:25:58.404 --> 01:26:00.240
I know, I know, I know.
Dad's fine.

01:26:00.323 --> 01:26:02.951
Go on, go back outside.
Go back, go back.

01:26:07.664 --> 01:26:09.749
What happened?

01:26:09.999 --> 01:26:11.000
Um...

01:26:14.128 --> 01:26:15.338
- I, uh...
- Jesus.

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:18.758
I just remembered
I left something at the office.

01:26:33.273 --> 01:26:36.568
<i>You've lately taken
a couple of swipes at the space program.</i>

01:26:36.776 --> 01:26:39.779
<i>I think it would be interesting
to talk more about</i>

01:26:39.863 --> 01:26:42.657
<i>whether this is the proper
thing to do with the public treasury.</i>

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.409
<i>The sort of dreams
I would have</i>

01:26:44.492 --> 01:26:46.870
<i>would be a habitable
New York City, for instance.</i>

01:26:46.953 --> 01:26:49.789
<i>It would seem to me that
that would be a reasonable thing to do.</i>

01:26:50.039 --> 01:26:52.792
<i>What has been
the reaction of your friends in this?</i>

01:26:52.876 --> 01:26:54.854
<i>Well, they mostly think
that it's ridiculous</i>

01:26:54.878 --> 01:26:56.504
<i>that we're spending
so much money</i>

01:26:56.588 --> 01:26:59.048
<i>to go somewhere
where we don't know anything about.</i>

01:26:59.132 --> 01:27:02.385
<i>And that the money
could be used for a lot more helpful things.</i>

01:27:08.516 --> 01:27:10.286
Power to the people!

01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:12.437
<i>A rat done bit my sister Nell</i>

01:27:12.604 --> 01:27:14.314
<i>With Whitey on the Moon</i>

01:27:15.106 --> 01:27:17.275
<i>Her face and arms
begin to swell</i>

01:27:17.442 --> 01:27:19.027
<i>And Whitey's on the Moon</i>

01:27:20.236 --> 01:27:22.155
<i>I can't pay no doctor bills</i>

01:27:22.405 --> 01:27:24.032
<i>But Whitey's on the Moon</i>

01:27:25.116 --> 01:27:27.201
<i>Ten years from now
I'll be payin' still</i>

01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:29.287
<i>While Whitey's on the Moon</i>

01:27:29.996 --> 01:27:34.334
<i>The man just upped my rent
last night and Whitey's on the Moon</i>

01:27:34.959 --> 01:27:36.836
<i>No hot water
no toilets, no lights</i>

01:27:37.003 --> 01:27:38.671
<i>But Whitey's on the Moon</i>

01:27:40.173 --> 01:27:42.467
<i>I wonder why he's upping me</i>

01:27:42.634 --> 01:27:44.218
<i>'Cause Whitey's on the Moon?</i>

01:27:45.053 --> 01:27:47.639
<i>Well, I was already
giving him, like, 50 a week</i>

01:27:47.805 --> 01:27:49.349
<i>And Whitey's on the Moon</i>

01:27:49.432 --> 01:27:50.975
Jesus, that's a big mother.

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.644
It's a political rush job.

01:27:52.894 --> 01:27:54.938
Congress wouldn't fund us
to come in second.

01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:57.815
Why else would NASA
be sending a rocket

01:27:57.899 --> 01:28:00.318
that's had one issue
after another to the Moon?

01:28:00.735 --> 01:28:02.779
Thanks for the insight, Buzz.

01:28:05.198 --> 01:28:06.950
Always a pleasure with you.

01:28:09.369 --> 01:28:11.412
It doesn't matter,
he's not in the lunar lottery.

01:28:11.496 --> 01:28:12.705
And you are?

01:28:12.914 --> 01:28:16.876
Well, the only guys
they let on the LLTV since Neil's accident

01:28:17.043 --> 01:28:18.169
are ones that might land.

01:28:18.419 --> 01:28:19.899
So you think
you're going to the Moon?

01:28:20.338 --> 01:28:22.382
It's been up for grabs
since Gus died.

01:28:24.217 --> 01:28:26.469
I'm just saying
what you're thinking.

01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:33.226
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

01:28:38.773 --> 01:28:42.568
<i>Apollo 8 clearing
the VAB and headed toward the launchpad.</i>

01:28:48.574 --> 01:28:50.034
Hell of a rocket.

01:28:50.868 --> 01:28:52.078
Yeah.

01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:56.541
Everything stays on track,
11's gonna be the landing.

01:28:56.624 --> 01:28:58.876
I talked to Bob,
everyone's in agreement.

01:28:59.002 --> 01:29:00.837
We'd like you to command.

01:29:08.052 --> 01:29:09.178
Okay.

01:29:15.059 --> 01:29:16.870
<i>...helicopter vectored that way.</i>

01:29:16.894 --> 01:29:19.897
<i>It looks like a red dot
with a long, long tail.</i>

01:29:20.106 --> 01:29:22.233
<i>A long plume.
That's got to be the spacecraft.</i>

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.777
<i>That has to be
Apollo 10 reentering.</i>

01:29:25.903 --> 01:29:28.281
<i>And so,
the flight of Apollo 10</i>

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:32.201
<i>has performed
the major function of its mission.</i>

01:29:32.285 --> 01:29:35.329
<i>It has proved,
through these daring three astronauts,</i>

01:29:35.413 --> 01:29:38.041
<i>that all of the systems
work properly</i>

01:29:38.124 --> 01:29:42.587
<i>and that there should be no reason
why man cannot, perhaps as early as July,</i>

01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:46.549
<i>land on that picked spot
on the Moon's equator.</i>

01:29:46.716 --> 01:29:50.386
<i>These are sailors of the sky,
and what we've seen</i>

01:29:50.553 --> 01:29:55.933
<i>and heard today make the great ocean
voyages of the earthbound seem,</i>

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.102
<i>well, earthbound indeed.</i>

01:29:58.186 --> 01:30:01.230
<i>For as the poet wrote,
the crew of Apollo 10</i>

01:30:01.314 --> 01:30:04.192
<i>has "slipped
the surly bonds of Earth"</i>

01:30:04.358 --> 01:30:06.069
<i>and carried us over
into tomorrow.</i>

01:30:06.152 --> 01:30:07.445
<i>In the past few hours,</i>

01:30:07.528 --> 01:30:10.198
<i>man has come closer to the Moon
than ever in his history.</i>

01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:12.867
<i>There were those
terrifying moments when...</i>

01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:14.786
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Hmm?

01:30:15.495 --> 01:30:16.913
What's wrong?

01:30:17.705 --> 01:30:19.165
Nothing, honey.

01:30:20.583 --> 01:30:22.543
Your dad's going
to the Moon.

01:30:23.252 --> 01:30:24.295
Okay.

01:30:26.297 --> 01:30:27.965
Can I go outside?

01:30:28.716 --> 01:30:29.967
Sure.

01:30:35.306 --> 01:30:39.936
Uh, we're here
today to talk about the forthcoming flight.

01:30:40.019 --> 01:30:42.563
But we're able
to talk about it

01:30:42.647 --> 01:30:44.649
because of previous flights.

01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:48.027
Every flight took on
new objectives,

01:30:48.402 --> 01:30:52.198
and left us with very few
additions to be completed.

01:30:52.573 --> 01:30:53.991
We're very grateful
to those people

01:30:54.075 --> 01:30:55.910
who made it possible for us
to be here today.

01:30:57.036 --> 01:30:58.913
All right,
we'll take some questions now.

01:30:59.789 --> 01:31:00.790
Jim?

01:31:00.873 --> 01:31:03.626
Neil, when you learned
you were going to command this flight,

01:31:03.793 --> 01:31:06.129
were you surprised?
Overjoyed?

01:31:06.546 --> 01:31:07.839
I was pleased.

01:31:07.922 --> 01:31:09.924
Okay, but how would you
compare this feeling

01:31:10.007 --> 01:31:12.510
to winning an automobile
or being selected as an astronaut?

01:31:15.304 --> 01:31:16.806
I was pleased.

01:31:18.349 --> 01:31:19.350
Brian?

01:31:19.433 --> 01:31:21.769
Neil, if it does turn out,

01:31:22.061 --> 01:31:23.479
you'll go down in history.

01:31:23.563 --> 01:31:26.333
What kind of thoughts do you have
about that when the thought hits you...

01:31:26.357 --> 01:31:28.276
"Uh, gosh, suppose
that flight's successful..."

01:31:28.359 --> 01:31:30.199
We're planning on that flight
being successful.

01:31:30.653 --> 01:31:31.737
Uh...

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:35.658
I just meant how you feel
about being a part of history.

01:31:36.534 --> 01:31:38.661
I think I can shed
some light here.

01:31:39.662 --> 01:31:41.455
It's a responsibility,

01:31:42.498 --> 01:31:44.876
but it's exciting
to be the first.

01:31:45.751 --> 01:31:47.670
Even my wife is excited.

01:31:47.753 --> 01:31:51.007
She keeps slipping jewelry
into my PPK.

01:31:52.216 --> 01:31:54.361
You're planning
on taking some of her jewelry to the Moon, Buzz?

01:31:54.385 --> 01:31:55.428
Sure.

01:31:55.553 --> 01:31:59.182
What fella wouldn't wanna
give his wife bragging rights?

01:31:59.807 --> 01:32:00.850
Neil,

01:32:00.933 --> 01:32:02.435
will you take anything?

01:32:03.311 --> 01:32:05.563
Uh, if I had a choice,
I'd take more fuel.

01:32:06.731 --> 01:32:08.482
All right,
next question.

01:32:20.953 --> 01:32:23.247
I thought you were
gonna talk to the boys.

01:32:23.873 --> 01:32:25.875
What did you
want me to say?

01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:29.045
What do you wanna say?

01:32:29.128 --> 01:32:31.255
You're the one
that's going away.

01:32:31.339 --> 01:32:34.258
Well, it's too late now.
They're asleep.

01:32:36.719 --> 01:32:38.221
No, they're not, Neil.

01:32:39.222 --> 01:32:40.890
You know they're not.

01:32:41.515 --> 01:32:43.309
Why can't you talk to them?

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.103
What are you doing?

01:32:48.731 --> 01:32:49.732
Uh...

01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:51.317
I'm packing.

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:56.197
No. You're just killing time
until you can get in the car.

01:33:02.495 --> 01:33:04.121
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:33:08.417 --> 01:33:10.503
Neil, I need you
to talk to the boys.

01:33:12.797 --> 01:33:14.257
Can you hear me?

01:33:16.175 --> 01:33:18.175
I need you to talk to the boys.
What are you doing?

01:33:19.428 --> 01:33:20.513
- Stop.
- I'm going to work.

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:21.889
Well, just stop it.

01:33:22.056 --> 01:33:24.475
Just stop...
Just stop packing!

01:33:38.614 --> 01:33:40.825
What are the chances
you're not coming back?

01:33:42.326 --> 01:33:44.930
Hmm? What are the chances this is
the last time the boys are gonna see you?

01:33:44.954 --> 01:33:46.580
Well, I can't give you
an exact number.

01:33:46.664 --> 01:33:49.583
I don't want
a fucking number, Neil!

01:33:52.169 --> 01:33:55.631
It's not zero, is it?
Is it?

01:33:57.883 --> 01:34:00.386
- No.
- No, it's not.

01:34:01.929 --> 01:34:03.723
Pat doesn't have a husband.

01:34:04.765 --> 01:34:08.185
Those kids, they don't have
a father anymore.

01:34:10.479 --> 01:34:12.315
Do you understand
what that means?

01:34:14.358 --> 01:34:17.111
What are the chances
that's gonna be Ricky and Mark?

01:34:18.571 --> 01:34:22.533
And I...
I can't tell 'em that their dad spent

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:25.244
the last few minutes
packing his briefcase!

01:34:27.538 --> 01:34:29.123
You're gonna sit 'em down.

01:34:29.373 --> 01:34:30.833
Both of them.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.420
And you're gonna prepare them for the fact
that you might not ever come home.

01:34:34.628 --> 01:34:37.214
You're doing that. You.

01:34:38.174 --> 01:34:39.467
Not me.

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:42.470
I'm done.

01:34:49.435 --> 01:34:52.146
So you better start thinking
about what you're gonna say.

01:35:14.627 --> 01:35:18.714
Jimmy asked what you're gonna say
when you get onto the Moon.

01:35:23.803 --> 01:35:27.348
Well, we're not sure
we're gonna get onto the Moon. Uh...

01:35:28.724 --> 01:35:31.685
A lot of things have to go right
before that happens.

01:35:32.728 --> 01:35:35.064
How long
will you be gone?

01:35:35.731 --> 01:35:36.732
Um...

01:35:36.816 --> 01:35:38.943
Well, we launch in 10 days,
we'll be up for eight,

01:35:39.026 --> 01:35:40.861
and then about a month
in quarantine.

01:35:40.945 --> 01:35:42.446
What's quarantine?

01:35:43.572 --> 01:35:46.117
We'll be in isolation.

01:35:48.911 --> 01:35:51.455
Uh, to protect in case we

01:35:52.998 --> 01:35:56.085
carry any diseases
from the lunar surface

01:35:56.877 --> 01:36:00.339
or something of that nature.
It's not likely, but it's a precaution.

01:36:02.049 --> 01:36:04.718
So you won't be here
for my swim meet?

01:36:14.603 --> 01:36:15.729
No.

01:36:18.441 --> 01:36:19.608
Sorry.

01:36:30.619 --> 01:36:33.038
Does anyone have
any other questions?

01:36:35.791 --> 01:36:37.710
Do you think
you're coming back?

01:36:38.878 --> 01:36:40.921
We have real confidence
in the mission.

01:36:41.255 --> 01:36:43.382
And, uh,
there are some risks,

01:36:43.466 --> 01:36:46.051
but we have every intention
of coming back.

01:36:46.385 --> 01:36:48.262
But you might not.

01:37:02.985 --> 01:37:04.403
That's right.

01:37:13.996 --> 01:37:15.080
Okay.

01:37:16.749 --> 01:37:18.334
Okay. Time for bed.

It's your ship now.

01:46:58.622 --> 01:47:00.415
<i>And you can start PTC</i>

01:47:01.833 --> 01:47:03.877
All right.
Thank you, Houston.

01:47:11.676 --> 01:47:13.261
That smells funny.

01:47:13.345 --> 01:47:15.680
Like, uh,
charred electrical insulation.

01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:19.184
Might just be rocket fumes.

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.772
- Did you bring any music?
- No.

01:47:24.815 --> 01:47:26.108
Here, Buzz.

01:47:47.462 --> 01:47:50.173

<i>This is a damn

01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:48.435
Houston, stand by
for AUTO alarm.

01:50:48.852 --> 01:50:50.770
Neil, the, uh...
The voice tape recorder,

01:50:50.854 --> 01:50:52.373
- you know where that is?
- I don't know.

01:50:52.397 --> 01:50:54.607
All this food and stuff up here,
you want any of that?

01:50:54.774 --> 01:50:55.775
No.

01:50:55.984 --> 01:50:56.985
All right.

01:50:57.193 --> 01:51:00.155
What about this chewing gum?
You want any of that?

01:51:00.405 --> 01:51:01.573
Mike.

01:51:05.744 --> 01:51:07.537

<i>don't forget to cycle it back

01:51:43.907 --> 01:51:45.658
<i>Eagle, Houston,
could you give us a hack</i>

01:51:45.742 --> 01:51:48.536
<i>on the time that you
switched to LEM power</i>

01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:52.582
<i>and also verify that

01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.840
<i>- Roger.
- Eagle, Columbia.</i>

<i>All 12 docking latches

<i>How about using,

<i>I have 100 hours

01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:46.511
<i>Eagle, keep an eye

<i>Continuous burn time is

<i>Eagle, Houston.

<i>Roger. How does it look?</i>

01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:53.745
The Eagle has wings.

01:54:29.322 --> 01:54:30.615
It just won't stay.

01:54:32.951 --> 01:54:34.678
<i>Eagle, report status. Over.</i>

01:54:34.702 --> 01:54:36.287
We'll have to
tell them about that.

01:54:37.163 --> 01:54:38.998
Let's prep for descent.

01:54:39.666 --> 01:54:42.061
<i>Eagle, Houston.
You're a go for powered descent.</i>

01:54:42.085 --> 01:54:43.711
Roger. Read you.

01:54:49.425 --> 01:54:51.844
Altitude light's on,
we don't have radar data.

01:54:57.767 --> 01:54:59.227
Let's proceed.

01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:02.564
Proceed.

01:55:03.106 --> 01:55:04.232
One...

01:55:04.899 --> 01:55:05.900
Zero...

01:55:06.067 --> 01:55:07.277
Ignition.

01:55:18.037 --> 01:55:19.664
Program alarm.

01:55:20.206 --> 01:55:21.708
What's a 1202 alarm?

01:55:21.874 --> 01:55:23.251
I don't know.

01:55:23.418 --> 01:55:26.337
Houston, give us a reading
on the 1202 program alarm.

01:55:26.921 --> 01:55:29.066
<i>Roger, we got you.
We're a go on that alarm.</i>

01:55:35.305 --> 01:55:36.806
Same alarm.

<i>Roger.

01:56:04.125 --> 01:56:05.668
Okay, 3,000 at 70.

01:56:05.752 --> 01:56:07.337

<i>Same type. We're go.</i>

01:56:51.339 --> 01:56:53.257
Pretty rocky area.

01:56:57.011 --> 01:56:59.180
Those boulders
are as big as cars.

01:56:59.389 --> 01:57:00.723
We can't land there.

01:57:09.357 --> 01:57:10.608

01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:23.996
540 feet, down to 30.

01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:26.124

160 feet,
six and a half down.

01:57:47.854 --> 01:57:50.148
Five and a half down,
nine forward.

01:57:54.527 --> 01:57:56.612
<i>Low level. Low level.</i>

5% fuel remaining.

01:58:03.327 --> 01:58:04.495
Quantity light!

01:58:05.037 --> 01:58:08.583
Ninety-four seconds to bingo.
114's a mandatory abort.

01:58:13.379 --> 01:58:14.964
Down to half, six forward.

01:58:15.923 --> 01:58:17.800
<i>Stand by for 60. Rog.</i>

01:58:18.217 --> 01:58:20.487
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

01:58:20.511 --> 01:58:22.096
40 feet, down two and a half.

01:58:29.061 --> 01:58:30.330
<i>Stand by for 30.</i>

01:58:30.354 --> 01:58:32.154
<i>- Thirty seconds.
- Forward.</i>

01:58:35.651 --> 01:58:37.891
20 feet, down a half!

01:58:43.618 --> 01:58:46.704
Faint shadow.
Drifting forward, just a little bit.

01:59:18.569 --> 01:59:20.404
Contact light.

01:59:21.989 --> 01:59:23.616
Shutdown.

01:59:34.752 --> 01:59:37.004
<i>We copy, you're down, Eagle.</i>

01:59:41.217 --> 01:59:42.510
Houston,

01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:44.720
Tranquility Base here.

01:59:47.557 --> 01:59:49.392
The Eagle has landed.

01:59:49.934 --> 01:59:51.453
<i>Roger, Tranquility.</i>

01:59:51.477 --> 01:59:52.979
<i>We copy on the ground.</i>

01:59:53.062 --> 01:59:54.897
<i>You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.</i>

01:59:54.981 --> 01:59:56.983
<i>We're breathing again.
Thanks a lot.</i>

01:59:59.318 --> 02:00:00.987
Thank you.

02:00:04.365 --> 02:00:06.325
Very smooth touchdown.

02:01:54.934 --> 02:01:58.437
<i>Okay, Neil,
we can see you coming down the ladder now.</i>

02:02:09.490 --> 02:02:11.784
<i>Okay, I just checked.
Uh...</i>

02:02:12.243 --> 02:02:15.246
<i>Coming back up to that
first step, Buzz, it's, uh...</i>

02:02:16.998 --> 02:02:21.377
<i>The strut hasn't collapsed too far,
but it's adequate to get back up.</i>

02:02:22.294 --> 02:02:23.397
<i>Roger, we copy.</i>

02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:24.901
<i>Takes a pretty good
little jump.</i>

02:02:42.606 --> 02:02:44.209
<i>Buzz, this is Houston.</i>

02:02:44.233 --> 02:02:47.069
<i>F2, 1/160 a second</i>

02:02:47.403 --> 02:02:50.614
<i>for shadow photography
on the sequence camera.</i>

02:02:51.574 --> 02:02:53.117
<i>Okay.</i>

02:02:56.912 --> 02:02:59.331
<i>I'm, uh,
at the foot of the ladder.</i>

02:02:59.415 --> 02:03:05.212
<i>The LEM footbeds are only, uh,
depressed in the surface</i>

02:03:05.296 --> 02:03:08.299
<i>about one or two inches.</i>

02:03:08.382 --> 02:03:12.011
<i>Although, the surface
appears to be, uh,</i>

02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:15.973
<i>very, very fine grain
as you get close to it.</i>

02:03:16.057 --> 02:03:19.477
<i>It's almost like a powder
down there.</i>

02:03:20.144 --> 02:03:21.729
<i>Very fine.</i>

02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:33.282
<i>I'm gonna step off
the LEM now.</i>

02:03:43.959 --> 02:03:46.796
<i>That's one
small step for man,</i>

02:03:49.006 --> 02:03:52.176
<i>one giant leap
for mankind.</i>

02:05:22.474 --> 02:05:24.685
<i>Okay, you ready
for me to come out?</i>

02:08:45.511 --> 02:08:50.265
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

02:08:50.474 --> 02:08:51.558
<i>Ignition.</i>

02:09:01.527 --> 02:09:05.030
<i>...I suppose they can
never really describe to us.</i>

02:09:05.697 --> 02:09:07.008
<i>- Or will we ever know?
- No...</i>

02:09:07.032 --> 02:09:08.283
<i>And it may not be a beauty</i>

02:09:08.367 --> 02:09:11.078
<i>that one can pass on
to future beholders either.</i>

02:09:11.161 --> 02:09:13.956
<i>These first men on the Moon
have seen something</i>

02:09:14.039 --> 02:09:17.126
<i>that men who follow
will have missed.</i>

02:09:17.626 --> 02:09:21.922
<i>They've peered
into another life that we can't follow.</i>

02:09:22.089 --> 02:09:25.634
<i>Bob Simon at Trafalgar Square,
where he joined the thousands</i>

02:09:25.801 --> 02:09:28.095
<i>who watched an immense
television screen</i>

02:09:28.262 --> 02:09:30.305
<i>as the Apollo touched down
on the Moon.</i>

02:09:30.389 --> 02:09:33.434
<i>The average Romanian
thinks of Apollo 11 a little bit</i>

02:09:33.517 --> 02:09:35.310
<i>as his own personal adventure.</i>

02:09:35.394 --> 02:09:38.939
<i>It's been estimated that
the audience was up in the hundreds of millions.</i>

02:09:39.022 --> 02:09:42.776
<i>Perhaps 400 million persons
or so watching this broadcast...</i>

02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:45.154
<i>Countless millions more
listened on the radio</i>

02:09:45.237 --> 02:09:46.697
<i>to the voices from the Moon.</i>

02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:50.033
<i>Never before had so many people
been attuned to one event</i>

02:09:50.284 --> 02:09:51.827
<i>at one time.</i>

02:09:56.582 --> 02:09:57.725
<i>...feats of all time.</i>

02:09:57.749 --> 02:09:59.185
<i>Does it amaze you
that it's taken place?</i>

02:09:59.209 --> 02:10:03.088
<i>It not only amazes me, but I'm certain
that it amazes everybody in this country.</i>

02:10:03.172 --> 02:10:04.756
<i>What do you think of it?</i>

02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:06.467
<i>The Moon,
I hope that sometime</i>

02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:08.010
<i>everybody will go there.</i>

02:10:08.177 --> 02:10:10.780
<i>- Wanna go yourself?
- Oh, yeah, I wish I can go right now.</i>

02:10:10.804 --> 02:10:15.100
<i>I think this is a very important day.
It's a historical day.</i>

02:10:15.184 --> 02:10:19.229
<i>And the whole universe is concerned about this,
the landing on the Moon.</i>

02:10:19.313 --> 02:10:21.233
<i>And as a French woman,
how do you think about it?</i>

02:10:21.315 --> 02:10:23.400
<i>Oh, I think it's wonderful,
I always trusted America</i>

02:10:23.484 --> 02:10:25.027
<i>and I knew
they couldn't fail.</i>

02:10:25.777 --> 02:10:27.946
<i>And in Washington,
an anonymous citizen</i>

02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:31.867
<i>placed a small bouquet on
the grave of John F. Kennedy with a note.</i>

02:10:32.117 --> 02:10:34.745
<i>"Mr. President,
the Eagle has landed."</i>

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:38.999
<i>And indeed on this day,
as we mark the astronauts' return,</i>

02:10:39.082 --> 02:10:41.293
<i>it's hard not to think back
upon that speech</i>

02:10:41.376 --> 02:10:45.339
<i>our 35th president gave
just seven short years ago.</i>

02:10:45.631 --> 02:10:49.009
<i>If this capsule history of
our progress teaches us anything,</i>

02:10:49.384 --> 02:10:52.179
<i>it is that man,
in his quest for knowledge</i>

02:10:52.304 --> 02:10:55.724
<i>and progress is determined
and cannot be deterred.</i>

02:10:56.225 --> 02:10:58.185
<i>But why, some say,
the Moon?</i>

02:10:59.102 --> 02:11:01.438
<i>Why choose this as our goal?</i>

02:11:01.897 --> 02:11:05.734
<i>And they may well ask,
why climb the highest mountain?</i>

02:11:06.193 --> 02:11:09.363
<i>Why, 35 years ago,
fly the Atlantic?</i>

02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:11.990
<i>Why does Rice play Texas?</i>

02:11:12.407 --> 02:11:14.701
<i>We choose to go to the Moon.</i>

02:11:15.118 --> 02:11:17.246
<i>We choose to go to the Moon.</i>

02:11:19.081 --> 02:11:23.502
<i>We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade and do the other things,</i>

02:11:23.585 --> 02:11:27.422
<i>not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.</i>

02:11:29.007 --> 02:11:31.051
Mrs. Armstrong!
Mrs. Armstrong!

02:11:31.468 --> 02:11:33.011
How do you feel?

02:11:38.517 --> 02:11:40.203
Have you
spoken with your husband?

02:11:40.227 --> 02:11:42.187
Would your sons
like to be astronauts like him?

02:11:42.271 --> 02:11:43.689
Mrs. Armstrong!

02:11:43.772 --> 02:11:45.649
Have all your prayers
been answered?

02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:47.401
Yes, yes, they have.

02:11:47.484 --> 02:11:49.486
How would you
describe the flight?

02:11:50.028 --> 02:11:54.616
Well, uh, I can only say
it was outta this world.

02:11:55.951 --> 02:11:57.111
Thank you.

02:11:58.495 --> 02:12:00.473
They will be quarantined
the full three weeks,

02:12:00.497 --> 02:12:02.666
but there is no sign
of infection or disease.

02:12:06.295 --> 02:12:08.046
Congratulations, Jan.
