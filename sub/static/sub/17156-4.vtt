Let's call this
meeting to order.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.412
I'm sure the three
of us can figure out

11:20.414 --> 11:22.881
how to get two
more cutie marks!

11:22.883 --> 11:25.350
Um...yeah.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.985
The thing is...

11:26.987 --> 11:28.253
What?

11:28.255 --> 11:30.789
Well, you can't be a
Cutie Mark Crusader

11:30.791 --> 11:33.725
if you've already got
your cutie mark.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.393
Oh. Yeah.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.228
Just like Babs Seed.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.963
Well, I can just sit
quietly in the corner

11:38.965 --> 11:41.366
while you two figure out
what you're gonna do.

11:41.368 --> 11:45.904
Well, technically, the clubhouse
is for Crusaders only.

11:45.906 --> 11:46.938
Oh.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.406
Right.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.875
I guess I should just
come back later, then?

11:50.877 --> 11:54.279
I mean, you can't
come in then either.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.380
Oh.

11:55.382 --> 11:59.350
I don't even think we're
still supposed to be friends.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.452
[close]

12:00.454 --> 12:01.886
What?

12:06.392 --> 12:08.026
Sweetie Belle?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.728
Scootaloo?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.930
Come on, fillies!
This isn't funny.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.136
[echo] More trouble
with cutie marks?

12:19.271 --> 12:20.305
No.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.873
I mean, yeah.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.274
I mean...

12:23.276 --> 12:26.344
Well, I got mine, but my
friends didn't get theirs

12:26.346 --> 12:28.513
and now there's all
kinds of trouble.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.416
<i>Sounds to me like cutie</i>
<i>marks and trouble</i>

12:31.418 --> 12:35.420

<i>the same pod.</i>

12:35.422 --> 12:36.955
I guess so.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.290
I mean, if I was a
blank flank again,

12:39.292 --> 12:41.292
there wouldn't be a problem.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.461
<i>Your wish is my command.</i>

12:43.463 --> 12:46.965
<i>[whoosh]</i>

12:52.037 --> 12:53.071
Hey, Apple Bloom.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.773
Why'd you want to meet here?

12:55.908 --> 12:59.310
Well, us blankflanks
have to meet somewhere!

12:59.312 --> 13:01.846
Um... actually,
Apple Bloom,

13:01.848 --> 13:04.349
we both sort of got
our cutie marks.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.785
You did?

13:06.787 --> 13:08.486
What are they?

13:08.488 --> 13:12.056
Oh, we don't have time
to go into all that.

13:12.058 --> 13:15.026
And we certainly don't have time
to hang out in an old clubhouse.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.495
Yeah. We've got
responsibilities now.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.397
But, maybe we'll see you later.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.565
Much later.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.432
Wait!

13:21.434 --> 13:22.467
Hold on!

13:22.469 --> 13:23.935
I can get my cutie mark back.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.003
I think.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.806
I mean, I got it once, right?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.574
Just wait a second!

13:31.477 --> 13:34.078
No!

13:46.059 --> 13:48.026
Applejack: Breakfast!

13:48.028 --> 13:51.963
I'm not so sure sleep is the
cure-all Applejack thinks it is.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.934
Uh... Applejack?

13:55.936 --> 13:58.903
I know you said sleep is
supposed to make me feel better,

13:58.905 --> 14:02.106
but I'm pretty sure it's
making me feel worse.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.075
See? Now, what did
I tell you?

14:04.077 --> 14:05.476
A good night's
sleep will fix--

14:06.579 --> 14:10.548
Well, no wonder you
were so worked up.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.116
Didn't you hear what I said?

14:12.118 --> 14:13.084
I was trying to--

14:13.086 --> 14:17.088
Well, what do
we have here?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.156
What is it, Granny?

14:18.158 --> 14:19.390
What's wrong?

14:19.392 --> 14:21.092
Oh, nothin'.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.994
Right, Applejack?

14:22.996 --> 14:24.028
Right.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.530
Nothin' at all.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.131
Right, Big Mac?

14:29.034 --> 14:30.935
Truth is, Apple Bloom...

14:30.937 --> 14:33.071
it's your cutie mark.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.572
Eyup.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.573
Oh, no.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.641
What is it now?

14:42.147 --> 14:44.415
Well, I'll tell
you what it ain't.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.484
It ain't no apple!

14:46.486 --> 14:47.886
Nope!

14:47.888 --> 14:53.558
And we don't have
room for non-Apples!

14:53.560 --> 14:56.494
Time for you
to mosey on.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.162
You can't stay here.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.064
But this is my home.

15:02.167 --> 15:06.004
Oh, and you're gonna
have to change your name.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.439
Eyup!

15:08.441 --> 15:11.175
I think just "Bloom"
has a nice ring to it,

15:11.177 --> 15:13.611
don't you, Applejack?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.079

15:32.132 --> 15:34.666
This is getting ridiculous.

15:43.176 --> 15:47.612
I never thought I'd be so
happy to not get a cutie mark.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.013
What the--?

15:58.224 --> 16:02.260

cutie mark as long as I live!

16:07.967 --> 16:10.234
<i>[echo] Back so soon?</i>

16:10.236 --> 16:13.504
All right, whoever you are, I
don't know what spell you went

16:13.506 --> 16:17.508
and cast on me but I want
it to stop right now!

16:17.510 --> 16:19.510

16:26.686 --> 16:30.154

torment me with nightmares?

I don't want your help.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.005
Just get away from me!

16:47.007 --> 16:51.275
Oh, Apple Bloom, you can't get
away from your own shadow.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.586
Princess Luna!

17:01.588 --> 17:02.587
My shadow?

What do you mean?

17:12.231 --> 17:13.664
It's just me?

17:13.666 --> 17:16.567
You mean I've been doing
all this to myself?

17:16.569 --> 17:18.269
<i>Of course, Apple Bloom.</i>

17:18.271 --> 17:20.171
<i>It's your dream.</i>

17:20.173 --> 17:23.708
If I've been dreaming this whole
time, why don't I just wake up?

<i>Sometimes we can worry</i>
<i>about a thing so much,</i>

<i>the fear can make us feel like</i>
<i>we're trapped in a nightmare.</i>

17:34.586 --> 17:36.254
I don't suppose
there's anything

17:36.256 --> 17:39.223
you're particularly
afraid of, is there?

17:39.225 --> 17:41.059
Yeah.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.195
I guess I'm pretty worried
about getting my cutie mark.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.799
Well, that is the same as
worrying about who you are.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.101
That is all a cutie mark is.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.270
If you cannot
accept who you are,

17:52.272 --> 17:55.373
your life might seem
like a bad dream.

17:55.375 --> 18:00.812
But, if I like who I am, do you
think other ponies will too?

18:00.814 --> 18:03.848
Of course.

18:03.850 --> 18:07.185
Then it doesn't matter
what my cutie mark is!

18:07.187 --> 18:08.619
Indeed.
