00:02.710 --> 00:04.980
Keep chewing, guys.
I need more gum.

00:05.020 --> 00:07.250
I'm exhausted.

00:07.280 --> 00:12.120
This is the most exercise I've ever had.

00:14.190 --> 00:16.650
This is sugarless, right?
You told us it was sugarless!

00:16.720 --> 00:19.340
Because if I have gum with
sugar I get a little crazy!

00:20.300 --> 00:23.680
Uh, yeah, sure.
It's sugarless. Now spit.

00:26.070 --> 00:27.440
Hey, guys.
What's going...

00:31.240 --> 00:34.410
Is that my head made out
of chewed-up bubble gum?

00:34.440 --> 00:40.020
Um, if it were, would you think it
was really cool and be flattered?

00:40.050 --> 00:43.350
No. Actually, I'd think
it was really gross.

00:45.020 --> 00:48.030
Good thing it's not you, then.
It's clearly...

00:49.130 --> 00:51.130
Pinocchio.

00:53.230 --> 00:56.070
But it's a girl.

00:56.100 --> 01:00.340
Did I say "Pinocchio"?
I meant his lesser-known sister,

01:01.170 --> 01:02.370
Penny-occhio.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.910
Good morning, Gibson.

01:06.940 --> 01:09.110
No, it's not.
It's a terrible morning.

01:09.150 --> 01:13.350
I'm so sad, even that awesome sculpture
of Penny-occhio isn't cheering me up.

01:15.220 --> 01:17.950
Is it your pet turtle again?

01:17.990 --> 01:22.120
Gibson, if it hasn't been out of its shell
in a year, I think it might be gone.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.990
No, no. Shelly's fine.
He's just shy.

01:25.030 --> 01:28.330
I'm talking about my
grandmother, Grandma Nana.

01:28.370 --> 01:31.270
Please tell me she's moving
more than your turtle is.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.240
Oh, she's moving, all right.

01:33.270 --> 01:38.970
Right out of our apartment to be
closer to her new boyfriend, Bob.

01:39.010 --> 01:44.080
I'm sensing you don't like this Bob.

01:44.110 --> 01:47.120
I've tried doing stuff with them, but
we just have different interests.

01:47.150 --> 01:50.390
I mean, knitting, mahjong,
feeding the pigeons...

01:50.420 --> 01:54.190
They don't like any of that stuff!

01:54.220 --> 01:58.930
Well, I can't knit, and I don't
know how to play mahjong,

01:58.960 --> 02:00.400
but we can go feed the pigeons.

02:00.430 --> 02:05.170
Great. I'll hold them down and you
feed them with this little spoon.

02:07.370 --> 02:11.039
So, mahjong!
Sounds fun.

Whoo!

03:06.960 --> 03:10.030
Wait. Let me get that
for you, my lady.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.040
What are you doing?

03:13.070 --> 03:17.140
Well, if there's one thing
it's our charm and grace.

03:21.950 --> 03:26.320
I meant to do that.
Nearly mashed enough. t.

03:28.250 --> 03:32.020
So, here we are.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.990
I can't remember the last time
that we were alone together.

03:35.020 --> 03:36.290
You know, just the two of us.

03:36.330 --> 03:40.960
Hey, guys. Thanks for
inviting me to lunch.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.930
Why did you invite him?

03:42.970 --> 03:45.370
Because he's lonely and I want to help him.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.170
Look how pathetic he is.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.110
I keep beating him
even know the rules.'t

03:50.140 --> 03:52.110
I don't know the rules, either.

03:52.140 --> 03:54.280
It's a really confusing game.

03:55.980 --> 03:59.410
By the way, I think
Fletcher pooped his pants.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.920
Hi, Paisley. Can I interview you for
an article in the school paper?

04:07.960 --> 04:10.290
Sure. Ooh, nice hat!

04:11.230 --> 04:12.960
Why does it say "press?"

04:20.300 --> 04:23.270
It's not doing anything.

04:23.310 --> 04:25.270
Actually, "press" means that I...

04:27.210 --> 04:30.880
It's out of batteries.

04:30.910 --> 04:34.980
Hey, Olive, why am I not on the
cover of the school magazine?

04:35.020 --> 04:36.150
Look at this cover girl.

04:36.190 --> 04:38.050
I'm way prettier than she is!

04:39.390 --> 04:42.290
It's not a magazine.
And that's Abigail Timmons.

04:42.330 --> 04:45.930
She rescued an old man
from a burning building.

04:45.960 --> 04:50.030
Well, she could have at least
put on some lipstick first.

04:50.070 --> 04:52.970
Look, Lexi, in order to get
into the school newspaper,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.200
you have to do something newsworthy.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.270
Well, I'm dating Paisley's boyfriend, Keith.
Is that anything?

05:08.950 --> 05:10.990
It was really nice of you
to suggest this study...

05:11.020 --> 05:12.020
Date.

05:14.290 --> 05:17.860
Session. So, should
we start with...

05:17.890 --> 05:19.330
Slow dancing?

05:21.160 --> 05:23.030
Math.

05:23.070 --> 05:24.100
Oh.

05:24.130 --> 05:26.130
Sure, math is good.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.850
Let's say I have five
chocolate-covered strawberries,

05:36.880 --> 05:38.880
and I feed you one.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.150
How many do I have left?

05:46.090 --> 05:47.320
Hi, Gibson!
Come on in!

05:47.360 --> 05:50.230
Thanks. You said to
come by if I was lonely.

05:50.260 --> 05:54.130
Ooh, are these chocolate-covered
strawberries?

05:54.160 --> 05:57.000
Love them!

05:57.030 --> 05:59.170
Except for
the strawberry part. Ugh!

06:01.970 --> 06:04.040
Well, we were just in
the middle of studying, so...

06:04.070 --> 06:06.980
Perfect time for a study break!

06:07.010 --> 06:09.950
Good thing I brought my Bag O' Fun.

06:09.980 --> 06:14.980
Now, don't be misled
by the name Bag O' Fun.

06:15.020 --> 06:18.990
It's the stuff inside the bag that's fun.

06:20.290 --> 06:24.290
The bag itself is actually quite dangerous.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.160
So, let's see what you've got.

06:30.070 --> 06:32.030
Ooh, checkers.
Yeah.

06:32.070 --> 06:34.070
Jacks.
Uh-huh.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.210
<i>Gibson Pursuit?</i>

06:40.240 --> 06:43.180
It's a game I made up
with trivia about myself.

06:43.210 --> 06:46.880
Oh.
I'm really good at it.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.220
The only person who ever beats me is Bob.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.920
Okay. "Fun Facts."

06:57.190 --> 06:58.990
Okay...

06:59.030 --> 07:02.030
"When was Gibson
potty-trained?"

07:05.030 --> 07:07.040
Um, 18 months?

07:07.070 --> 07:09.100
Close. Sixteen months...

07:09.140 --> 07:10.810
Ago.

07:12.210 --> 07:16.110
Kidding, kidding!
I was 14.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.780
That was a fun fact.

07:19.820 --> 07:21.950
Almost as much fun as learning about

07:21.990 --> 07:25.050
your collection of earwax candles.

07:25.090 --> 07:26.250
If you want I could bring you...

07:26.290 --> 07:28.990
No, that's okay.
Thank you, though!

07:29.030 --> 07:31.990
I'm not allowed to play with fire.
Or earwax.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.860
You guys are awesome.

07:35.900 --> 07:39.170
We are totally going
to hang out together every day

07:39.200 --> 07:44.140
from now on for the rest of our lives!

07:44.170 --> 07:47.810
We are gonna be best BFF friends forever!

07:47.840 --> 07:50.850
Or for short, BBFFFFs.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.670
Hey, Chyna.
What are you doing?

08:00.710 --> 08:05.710
Trying to figure out what
to do about our new BBFFFF.

08:05.750 --> 08:08.810
I solve my problems
by writing songs about them.

08:08.850 --> 08:12.120
You've got to come up with something.
It's been a week already.

08:12.150 --> 08:18.790
Yesterday I almost won a game of <i>Gibson
Pursuit</i> <i>and that scares me.</i>

08:18.830 --> 08:21.760
The way I see it, we have two options.

08:21.790 --> 08:25.830
Keep trying to cheer him up, or find
a creative way to get rid of him.

08:25.870 --> 08:27.870
Here's what I've come up with so far.

08:29.140 --> 08:33.710
<i>♪ Our friend Gibson</i>
<i>was feeling down</i>

08:33.740 --> 08:37.140
<i>♪ Crying all day</i>
<i>like a sad little clown</i>

08:37.179 --> 08:41.150
<i>♪ Been playing games</i>
<i>with him for a week</i>

08:41.179 --> 08:45.050
<i>♪ What can we do</i>
<i>with this fuzzy-haired freak?</i>

08:46.920 --> 08:50.720
<i>♪ We can take him on a trip</i>
<i>to Albuquerque</i>

08:50.760 --> 08:53.060
<i>♪ Dehydrate his skin</i>
<i>and make Gibson jerky</i>

08:54.790 --> 08:55.990
Ooh!

08:56.030 --> 08:58.700
<i>♪ Give him a ride</i>
<i>on a merry-go-round</i>

08:58.730 --> 09:01.800
<i>♪ Or dress him like a dog</i>
<i>and take him to the poun</i>

09:02.940 --> 09:05.000
<i>♪ Go for a stroll</i>
<i>on some country roads</i>

09:05.040 --> 09:08.640
<i>♪ Or feed him fatty foods</i>
<i>till his heart explodes</i>

09:08.670 --> 09:11.080
<i>♪ Take him on a tour</i>
<i>to the south of France... ♪</i>

09:12.980 --> 09:15.850
What rhymes with "France"?

09:15.880 --> 09:18.680
Romance!
We should get him a girlfrie!

09:18.720 --> 09:22.650
I was thinking more like, "Stuff a
hungry squirrel down his pants."

09:22.690 --> 09:24.690
But that would be mean.

09:24.720 --> 09:27.030
To the squirrel.

09:27.060 --> 09:31.730
Come on. Love is the answer.
Everybody needs love.

09:31.760 --> 09:35.600
Isn't that true, Chyna?
Please say it's true.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.940
It is true.
That's a great idea, Fletcher.

09:38.970 --> 09:41.640
I could hug you right now!

09:41.670 --> 09:46.810
Okay. All we need to do is find a woman
who's looking for a mahjong-playing,

09:46.850 --> 09:51.780
pigeon-feeding hairy man-child who
keeps a dead turtle in a shoe box.

09:53.050 --> 09:56.760
Okay, this may be harder than I thought.

09:56.790 --> 09:59.890
Hey, how about we sign him up for one
of those Internet dating websites

09:59.930 --> 10:02.630
for people wh no hope?

10:02.660 --> 10:06.670
Yeah! There was this guy on my
street who found his wife that way.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.700
And he had to be cut out of his
home and airlifted to the wedding!

10:14.710 --> 10:19.880
Oh, Olive, there you are. I have a scoop
for the cover of this week's school paper.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.850
I rescued a bird.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.780
From where?
A tree.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.050
Birds live in trees.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.750
Well, this tree was on fire.

10:27.790 --> 10:28.990
Why didn't the bird just fly away?

10:29.020 --> 10:32.720
Oh, just take my picture, already!

10:32.760 --> 10:36.060
Okay. Give me
a really heroic look.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.100
Click.

10:43.140 --> 10:46.140
What are you doing?
You just pretended to take my picture.

10:46.170 --> 10:48.910
And you just pretended to rescue a bird!

10:48.940 --> 10:51.980
Oops, your eyes were closed.
One more.

10:52.010 --> 10:53.850
Click.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.220
Okay, here comes Gibson.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.950
I'll ask the questions, and you take
down his answers on my A.N.T. Pad.

11:02.690 --> 11:06.830
Hi, Gibson. We were just about to
play a game of "Gibson Pursuit."

11:06.860 --> 11:09.660
The new edition came out
with all new questions.

11:11.700 --> 11:15.000
Wow. Can't believe I didn't
hear about that. I'm in!

11:20.070 --> 11:21.940
All righty!

11:21.970 --> 11:25.010
What is Gibson's idea of a perfect date?

11:25.040 --> 11:26.950
November 3rd.

11:30.050 --> 11:33.150
Um... Let's try another one.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.860
What is the last book Gibson read?

11:37.890 --> 11:40.960
Uh... <i>Living With</i>
<i>Chronic Dandruff.</i>

11:43.900 --> 11:46.730
Well, it was really more of a pamphlet.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.930
I'm just gonna put
<i>Pat the Bunny.</i>

11:49.970 --> 11:53.970
Who doesn't love <i>Pat the Bunny?
</i> <i>You get to pat the bunny!</i>

11:54.010 --> 11:56.840
Wait a second, what's going on here?

11:57.780 --> 11:59.110
All right, the truth is

11:59.150 --> 12:01.980
we want to fill out your
profile for a dating website.

12:02.010 --> 12:05.080
Yeah, we thought you'd be less
lonely if you had a girlfriend.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.820
Thanks, but I'm just
not ready for a relationship.

12:08.850 --> 12:13.020
Which is why I keep fending off the
advances of Janet the janitor.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.860
That and she smells like urinal cake.

12:19.770 --> 12:24.000
Which reminds me.
Kids, don't be fooled by the word "cake."

12:24.040 --> 12:29.010
Urinal cakes are far from delicious
and, actually, quite poisonous.

12:34.110 --> 12:40.050
Gibson, we could probably find you someone
who doesn't smell like toilet poison.

12:40.090 --> 12:43.790
Sorry, but I'm still hung up
on my ex-girlfriend, Sophie.

12:43.820 --> 12:46.160
Our breakup was really devastating.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.000
Mmm, rasp-apple.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.930
Can I have a sip, Gibson?

12:52.970 --> 12:57.800
No! Forget it! You may be my
girlfriend, but you're still a girl.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.900
I don't want cooties!

12:59.940 --> 13:01.910
Give it!
No!

13:01.940 --> 13:03.710
Doody head!

13:11.880 --> 13:15.820
Hey, come on, babe.
We can work this out!

13:18.760 --> 13:21.090
The next thing you know, she
was out of my life forever.

13:21.130 --> 13:24.100
And the sand permanently
dried out my scalp.

13:27.030 --> 13:31.070
Wait a minute.
Your last girlfriend was 25 years ago?

13:31.100 --> 13:35.840
Yeah. And not a day has gone by
that I haven't thought of Sophie.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.680
Well, except the day I
entered a pie-eating contest

13:39.710 --> 13:42.050
and fell into
a sugar-induced coma.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.080
But I came in second!

13:47.950 --> 13:49.920
Stupid Bob!

13:51.890 --> 13:52.960
What does this have to do

13:52.990 --> 13:54.890
with this girl you
can't stop thinking about?

13:54.930 --> 13:57.960
Oh, Sophie!

14:08.640 --> 14:11.040
I picked the wrong day to wear black.

14:19.950 --> 14:22.790
Oh no! Paisley is choking!

14:22.820 --> 14:25.960
I need to save her life
in a newsworthy fashion!

14:25.990 --> 14:30.090
Help! I have food lodged
in my Snuffleupagus.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.900
Does she mean her esophagus?

14:33.930 --> 14:37.770
Yeah. Her brain is oxygen-starved.
More than usual.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.940
I'll save you, Paisley!

14:41.040 --> 14:43.880
Oh, Lexi.
You are my hero.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.710
Spit out a meatball.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.850
Look, if she were really choking,
she wouldn't even be able to talk.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.920
She's not talking.
Yeah, I'm not talking.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.920
Oh, my gosh.
She's actually choking!

14:59.960 --> 15:01.690
Help! What do I do?

15:06.670 --> 15:10.070
Wow, Abigail! That was unbelievable.
Here, smile!

15:10.100 --> 15:12.800
Ah! Don't smile.
Don't smile.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.920
Angus, what are you doing?

15:29.960 --> 15:31.860
Thanks to the Internet,

15:31.890 --> 15:34.790
I'm winning a dance competition
in the Philippines.

15:37.700 --> 15:38.700
Okay, okay, okay!

15:39.100 --> 15:40.800
We need your help.

15:40.830 --> 15:44.000
Can you use your computer to track
down Gibson's ex-girlfriend?

15:44.040 --> 15:46.000
Oh, sure.

15:47.670 --> 15:49.710
Typety-type-type.

15:52.980 --> 15:54.010
What was that?

15:54.050 --> 15:57.050
Oh, you were serious?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.920
Gibson used to have a girlfriend?

16:04.090 --> 16:05.890
Yeah.
Her name's Sophie and...

16:05.930 --> 16:07.090
Found her.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.770
Well, where is she, Fletcher?
Ooh! Do you have her number?

16:14.800 --> 16:18.800
Yeah. It's 24601.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.740
That's not enough digits
for a phone number.

16:20.770 --> 16:24.810
No, but it's the right amount
for a prisoner ID number.

16:28.050 --> 16:29.810
Yeah... She's in jail.

16:35.090 --> 16:38.090
Okay, minor setback.

16:40.660 --> 16:41.930
But...

16:41.960 --> 16:45.630
All we need to do to reunite them

16:45.660 --> 16:49.700
is put Gibson in a dress and frame
him for a crime he did not commit.

16:52.710 --> 16:53.770
What?

16:53.810 --> 16:56.010
I told you, I think better with my guitar.

16:59.850 --> 17:01.580
What?

17:01.840 --> 17:03.490
Second place?

17:03.750 --> 17:05.710
Stupid Bob!

17:14.220 --> 17:18.720
I can't believe Gibson's ex-girlfriend
is in jail for robbing a bank.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.859
Maybe she'll get time off
for good behavior.

17:21.890 --> 17:23.089
I don't think so.

17:23.130 --> 17:25.000
Last week she beat a guard.

17:25.030 --> 17:26.859
With another guard.

17:28.770 --> 17:31.800
So she's aggressive.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.100
Some guys like that.

17:36.940 --> 17:41.780
I have an idea. We should take
Gibson to see Sophie in prison.

17:41.810 --> 17:45.780
Yeah, when he sees what she's become,
it'll shock him back to reality.

17:45.820 --> 17:49.820
And if that doesn't work, maybe
Sophie will beat me with you.

17:52.060 --> 17:55.130
Anything would be better than another
round of <i>Gibson Pursuit.</i>

17:56.190 --> 17:59.130
Hey, guys! Want to play
a game of <i>Gibsonary?</i>

18:01.830 --> 18:03.200
Guess what I'm drawing.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.710
Gibson...

18:07.740 --> 18:09.170
Yes!

18:11.140 --> 18:13.740
You are so good at this!

18:13.780 --> 18:15.910
No, we have great news!

18:15.950 --> 18:17.750
We found your
ex-girlfriend Sophie!

18:17.780 --> 18:19.750
Really? That's amazing!

18:19.790 --> 18:21.850
Tell me about her.
What does she do now?

18:21.890 --> 18:23.890
Um, she's in...

18:24.890 --> 18:26.090
Banking.

18:28.130 --> 18:30.730
She must be rich.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.730
I bet she lives in a big house.

18:33.770 --> 18:35.800
"The" big house, actually.

18:37.170 --> 18:39.940
Yeah. Six hundred bedrooms,

18:39.970 --> 18:43.170
a huge yard, and a really
good security system.

18:49.150 --> 18:53.020
Wow. This really
is a big house.

18:53.050 --> 18:56.820
Okay, Gibson, time to see what the
love of your life has become.

18:56.860 --> 19:00.060
Watch your hands!
You know I can chew through bone.

19:02.160 --> 19:06.830
I can't believe it.
She's more beautiful than ever.

19:11.770 --> 19:15.010
And she looks good in orange.

19:17.780 --> 19:22.780
I wish I could argue with him, but
she does look good in orange.

19:24.750 --> 19:27.720
Okay, Paisley, here's the plan.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.190
This doll is you.

19:31.020 --> 19:32.920
Why am I a troll?

19:32.960 --> 19:35.030
Genetics.

19:35.060 --> 19:38.200
Anyway, you walk
out of school at 4:15,

19:38.230 --> 19:40.230
right when Olive will be there.

19:43.770 --> 19:45.100
Then I come out...

19:47.870 --> 19:51.080
Just as a monster truck
comes barreling towards you.

19:51.110 --> 19:52.210
And you push me out of the way?

19:52.240 --> 19:53.880
Nope!

19:57.220 --> 20:01.890
But I do administer first aid,

20:01.920 --> 20:06.790
become a hero, and make the
cover of the school newspaper.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.030
But my head's on backwards.

20:10.060 --> 20:11.930
Does everything have to be about you?

20:14.800 --> 20:18.000
I can't believe Gibson's not fazed
by the fact that Sophie's in prison.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.100
I know.
He thinks it's cute.

20:20.140 --> 20:23.070
He said she's having
a 25-year "time out."

20:26.140 --> 20:27.810
Gotta do something.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.120
Ooh, chocolate!
Mind if I have some?

20:37.160 --> 20:39.790
Here you go, Sophie.

20:39.820 --> 20:41.890
She's got a knife!

20:45.300 --> 20:48.070
Wow, a rose!

20:48.100 --> 20:52.900
The only way this could be more romantic
is if it were melted over a strawberry.

20:52.940 --> 20:55.810
So I could eat it off of the strawberry.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.110
I really hate strawberries.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.280
I do, too.

21:03.850 --> 21:07.920
Give it up, Chyna.
They obviously love each other.

21:07.950 --> 21:10.820
I guess the heart wants
what the heart wants.

21:10.860 --> 21:14.930
Wait a second. You're right.
That's perfect!

21:14.960 --> 21:19.100
He'll visit her every day after school
instead of hanging out with us!

21:19.130 --> 21:20.200
This calls for...

21:20.230 --> 21:21.870
A hug!
A toast.

21:25.070 --> 21:26.840
To our freedom!

21:28.240 --> 21:29.810
I am so sorry.

21:32.980 --> 21:35.250
Look, there's a fire!

21:38.150 --> 21:41.150
This is a real emergency!
We need to act fast!

21:41.190 --> 21:43.850
I'll put my hair in a French
braid, you go get Olive.

21:43.890 --> 21:45.790
Okay.

21:45.820 --> 21:49.190
Finally, the cover of the paper is mine.

21:50.130 --> 21:51.200
Fire!

21:52.930 --> 21:54.800
Oh, no you don't, Abigail!

21:54.830 --> 21:56.170
You publicity hog!

22:16.330 --> 22:17.350
Smile.

22:17.550 --> 22:18.750
