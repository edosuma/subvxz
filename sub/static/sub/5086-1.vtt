00:14.667 --> 00:19.233
This court is now open for
the dispatch of its business.

00:19.267 --> 00:22.200
God save the State
and this honorable court.

00:22.233 --> 00:28.533
Docket #861525: State of
Washington vs. Timothy Olsen.

00:28.567 --> 00:30.267
Timothy Olson,
for the crime of

00:30.300 --> 00:32.933
aggravated assault with
special circumstances,

00:32.967 --> 00:35.533
I hereby sentence you to
two years in state prison.

00:42.467 --> 00:44.867
I love you, okay?

00:44.900 --> 00:46.333
Stay together.

00:46.367 --> 00:47.967
Wait! Dad, wait!

00:48.000 --> 00:50.167
This is all your fault!

00:50.200 --> 00:51.600
Quiet in the gallery!

00:51.633 --> 00:53.933
Take care of
sister, Came

00:53.967 --> 00:56.100
Stop him

00:56.133 --> 01:06.067
Dad, ple

01:06.067 --> 01:08.500
Crestview PD.
My badge.

01:08.533 --> 01:09.800
Do something ple

01:09.833 --> 01:11.100
Detective!

01:11.133 --> 01:23.800
Stop... now.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.667
I understand that
you're upset,

01:25.700 --> 01:27.267
but you cannot behave
that way in court.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.967
Sorry I can't be
happy like you.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.567
Do not speak to
aunt that way.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.533
No one is happy.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.067
Then fix it!

01:33.067 --> 01:34.067
I can't.

01:34.067 --> 01:36.167
Allison?

01:36.200 --> 01:38.667
Linda.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.300
Sorry I'm running late
and for the sentence.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.433
Thank you.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.633
Their mother didn't
complete the program?

01:44.667 --> 01:47.233
Okay, well I've got beds.

01:47.267 --> 01:49.433
I can take them now.

01:49.467 --> 01:52.067
We need a little
more time.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.600
Has some f
come forwa

01:53.633 --> 01:55.300
Hardly.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.467
This isn't like planning
a trip to Epcot.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.867
You can't make
reservations in advance.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.600
I understand that, and that
Child Protective Services

02:02.633 --> 02:05.900
is brutally understaffed
and unfairly overworked.

02:05.933 --> 02:07.933
In fact, given your
enormous case load,

02:07.967 --> 02:10.167
if you were to put the
kids' file at the bottom,

02:10.200 --> 02:12.400
you might not get
to it for a day or two.

02:12.433 --> 02:16.600
No one could blame you.

02:16.633 --> 02:18.600
One or two more
days of that?

02:18.633 --> 02:20.433
I take full
responsibility.

02:20.467 --> 02:22.200
I always do what's right
for the children.

02:22.233 --> 02:25.100
And we're so grateful.

02:25.133 --> 02:29.367
Good luck.

02:29.400 --> 02:34.367
Okay, let's go home.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.733
Why should we
go with you?

02:38.767 --> 02:41.233
Because we're
your family.

02:41.267 --> 02:49.833
Like it or not.

02:49.867 --> 02:51.400
How about the girls
ride with Mom

02:51.433 --> 02:53.167
and the boys can
go with Dad?

02:53.200 --> 02:56.167
That's good by

02:56.200 --> 02:58.800
Allison!

02:58.833 --> 03:00.567
Devin?

03:00.600 --> 03:02.067
Sorry to int
but we're up

03:02.067 --> 03:05.167
Armed robbe
one victim

03:05.200 --> 03:07.600
All right,
everybody in my car!

03:07.633 --> 03:08.967
Love you.

03:09.067 --> 03:11.367
Love you, too.

03:11.400 --> 03:19.833
Sorry,

03:19.867 --> 03:21.800
Wow, that's so cute.

03:21.833 --> 03:28.300
Yeah because what if we
never see her again, jer

03:28.333 --> 03:30.633
Are you okay we put your brother
in prison for two years?

03:30.667 --> 03:32.767
He put himself there.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.600
Wish that were a m
popular opinion.

03:34.633 --> 03:36.100
Spend a few minutes
with his kids,

03:36.133 --> 03:37.700
you'll get a taste of
how great it feels

03:37.733 --> 03:40.200
to have done
the right thing.

04:14.967 --> 04:16.400
Let's go, Cam.

04:16.433 --> 04:20.267
No.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.567
Your sister went in.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.933
Mariah's an idiot.

04:24.967 --> 04:26.900
I was paying attention
at the courthouse.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.933
You think I don't know a Child
Services zombie when I see one?

04:30.967 --> 04:32.967
You're just gonna
ship us off.

04:33.067 --> 04:36.067
I'll wait here, save
myself the steps.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.500
Interesting.

04:38.533 --> 04:41.067
Now get out of the car.

04:41.067 --> 04:42.467
Why should I do
what you tell me?

04:42.500 --> 04:43.733
It would be a shame
to waste

04:43.767 --> 04:46.067
all this righteous anger
on an empty car.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.700
Now you're making
fun of me?

04:47.733 --> 04:49.167
Never.

04:49.200 --> 04:56.667
Just pointing out... you're
a man of limited options.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.233
No one else was
in the store?

05:06.267 --> 05:07.700
Who pulled a
weapon first?

05:07.733 --> 05:09.233
Him, of course.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.900
The stupid punk.

05:10.933 --> 05:12.367
So you shot

05:12.400 --> 05:15.200
I was shooting
at him, but...

05:15.233 --> 05:16.900
She stepped in,
tried to stop him.

05:16.933 --> 05:18.100
You sho

05:18.133 --> 05:19.867
I didn't mean to.

05:19.900 --> 05:23.667
I was protecting
my store, my life!

05:23.700 --> 05:31.233
Thanks, you can
take him now.

05:31.267 --> 05:35.467
Unis are pulling the
surveillance footage.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.233
Manager estimates they got
eighty dollars and change.

05:38.267 --> 05:44.100
Not exactly fresh start money
with a baby on the way.

05:44.133 --> 05:48.200
I'd go to ground, hide
with a buddy, regroup.

05:48.233 --> 05:50.500
And we need to watch
the pharmacies.

05:50.533 --> 05:55.733
They didn't take enough
to keep a doctor quiet.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.800
That better
be my save

06:08.833 --> 06:11.467
It's not, I made my own.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.433
That's what you said
about Assassin's Creed

06:13.467 --> 06:18.367
and then you destroyed
multi-player reputation

06:35.600 --> 06:37.067
May I help you?

06:37.067 --> 06:40.767
Is Cameron here?

06:40.800 --> 06:42.600
Sorry, I don't think
we've met. You are...

06:42.633 --> 06:45.067
Here for Cameron.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.067
Nice to meet you,
"Here for Cameron."

06:47.100 --> 06:49.900
I'm his uncle,
"I Don't Think So."

06:49.933 --> 06:51.133
Hey,

06:51.167 --> 06:52.800
Cameron, let's go.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.067
Hey!

06:54.067 --> 06:55.567
I don't think you
heard my name.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.900
Listen this time:
I Don't Think So.

06:57.933 --> 07:01.633
Thanks for stopping by,
no need to do it again.

07:01.667 --> 07:02.833
You can't keep

07:02.867 --> 07:04.300
I absolutely can.

07:04.333 --> 07:05.967
He's my fr

07:06.067 --> 07:09.433
Aim higher.
And put the bags down.

07:09.467 --> 07:11.800
You don't want me he
I don't wanna be her

07:11.833 --> 07:13.433
why not let me

07:13.467 --> 07:16.333
You're my responsibility
and I think leaving the house

07:16.367 --> 07:31.067
with that guy, angry as
you are, is a lousy decision.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.433
Wallet and
cell phone too.

07:32.467 --> 07:33.467
No way.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.400
He'll shake you down.

07:35.433 --> 07:48.633
It's better just
to hand them over.

07:48.667 --> 07:52.100
This tells me when any window
or door in this house opens.

07:52.133 --> 07:55.667
And Rachel will tell you
I'm faster than I look.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.267
This is comple
messed up.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.233
Whose mess is it?

08:00.267 --> 08:01.533
You've
hated m

08:01.567 --> 08:04.567
Sure, that's why
I hired him.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.467
If you need some time
to calm down,

08:07.500 --> 08:10.733
you can use Jeff's
room for a bit.

08:10.767 --> 08:14.300
When do
my stuff

08:14.333 --> 08:16.733
We'll talk about it when
your aunt gets home.

08:16.767 --> 08:21.567
Welcome to being grounded,
McLean style.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.433
So you're all
at it, huh?

08:23.467 --> 08:28.833
Good at what, Cameron?

08:28.867 --> 08:38.900
Throwing people in jai

08:38.900 --> 08:55.833
Throwing people in jai

08:55.867 --> 08:56.967
The security foo
corroborates

08:57.067 --> 08:58.667
the manager's testimon

08:58.700 --> 09:01.200
Self-defense for him,
stupid move for the kid.

09:01.233 --> 09:03.333
Tech just printed these.

09:03.367 --> 09:05.133
Do we have anything on
either of the youngsters?

09:05.167 --> 09:06.667
Nothin

09:06.700 --> 09:08.300
The car was parked out of
range of the outdoor cameras

09:08.333 --> 09:10.433
so no plates to run.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.400
Think that's a coincidence, or
have they done this before?

09:12.433 --> 09:13.833
Possible.

09:13.867 --> 09:15.467
No usable prints
at the scene.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.067
We'll run their pictures
through the database.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.767
We'll have the gang task
force look at these, too.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.333
See if they know them.

09:20.367 --> 09:21.900
And you're
McLean?

09:21.933 --> 09:23.333
Excuse me?

09:23.367 --> 09:26.333
You've had a
difficult morn

09:26.367 --> 09:28.300
Thank you ma'am,
I'm fine.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.300
As you always are.

09:30.333 --> 09:33.833
Keep me posted.

09:33.867 --> 09:35.767
Is everyone talking
about the sentencing?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.233
No.

09:37.267 --> 09:41.100
Wilkes is just checking in
that warm, loving way of hers.

09:41.133 --> 09:43.733
Allison, Devin. You wanted
to know about pharmacy hits

09:43.767 --> 09:46.067
Call just came in from Go
Friends Pharmacy on Pine.

09:46.067 --> 09:48.567
Armed robbery,
young man with a g

09:48.600 --> 09:50.133
Thank you, Victoria.

09:50.167 --> 09:51.433
Wait, I was just
sharing intel.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.200
That's our case.

09:53.233 --> 09:54.367
No it's ours, I'm sure.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.167
And then you'd have
to come back here,

09:56.200 --> 09:59.500
do a lot of paperwork,
then brief us and turn it over.

09:59.533 --> 10:05.500
You're wel

10:10.233 --> 10:14.033
...and then he dragged
me out right here,

10:14.067 --> 10:17.400
he had the
gun still.

10:17.433 --> 10:21.233
He took my
car keys!

10:21.267 --> 10:25.600
Was this the

10:25.633 --> 10:28.567
Did he do anything else
before he drove away?

10:28.600 --> 10:33.333
Took a j
from tha

10:33.367 --> 10:35.933
And he stole painkillers
and antibiotics?

10:35.967 --> 10:38.300
For a gunshot wo
he claimed.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.800
Did he say anything
about how she's doing?

10:39.833 --> 10:42.000
The girl who was shot?

10:42.033 --> 10:46.900
I thought he was just
a junkie, lying.

10:46.933 --> 10:50.100
I know this has be
difficult, thank y

10:50.133 --> 10:53.900
You can wait inside while
we take a look at the car.

10:53.933 --> 10:57.267
No that's
perfect, gre

10:57.300 --> 11:01.233
Yeah text it to
please, thanks.

11:01.267 --> 11:03.767
This wreck was repor
stolen two hours ago

11:03.800 --> 11:11.267
No wonder they took
pharmacist's Lexus.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.433
There's blood on
the front seat.

11:13.900 --> 11:15.867
He didn't wipe it do

11:15.900 --> 11:18.733
We'll be a
to lift pr

11:18.767 --> 11:20.467
Let's visit the owner.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.333
You think our guy stole this
from a friend or a stranger?

11:23.367 --> 11:33.400
What's the point of frien
if you can't rip them off

11:33.400 --> 11:38.533
What's the point of frien
if you can't rip them off

11:38.567 --> 11:39.367
Get out, Mariah.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.733
No.

11:40.767 --> 11:43.067
This is the only private
place to talk.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.600
Who says I want to tal

11:44.633 --> 11:47.267
Then listen: stop
screwing this up.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.767
You're getting
us in trouble.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.733
What's all this us cra

11:50.767 --> 11:52.533
Since when are we a
buy one, get one fr

11:52.567 --> 11:55.667
They're gonna
keep us together.

11:55.700 --> 11:56.667
Aren't they?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.333
Child Serv

11:58.367 --> 12:00.100
Uncle Matt and
Aunt Allison.

12:00.133 --> 12:01.167
Like they

12:01.200 --> 12:03.133
They do!

12:03.167 --> 12:05.433
Then why i
in prison?

12:05.467 --> 12:06.933
She cou
kept hi

12:06.967 --> 12:09.533
Maybe she tried.

12:09.567 --> 12:11.733
Not big on
truth, are

12:11.767 --> 12:13.300
Just lik

12:13.333 --> 12:15.600
She leave you any of her pill
before she went to rehab?

12:15.633 --> 12:19.067
Don't talk about
Mom like that.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.567
Why?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.533
If she was clean, we could b
home and wouldn't have

12:22.567 --> 12:24.433
to be taking chari
from the backstabb

12:24.467 --> 12:25.400
Shut up!
They'll hear you!

12:25.433 --> 12:26.367
You think I

12:26.400 --> 12:27.367
They'll throw us out.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.300
Go

12:28.333 --> 12:29.367
We've got nowhere
else to go!

12:29.400 --> 12:30.933
I DON'T

12:30.967 --> 12:33.733
ariah?M

12:33.767 --> 12:37.067
Are you okay,
Mariah?

12:37.100 --> 12:46.767
Of course not.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.700
Do you want to chill in
a brother-free space?

12:49.733 --> 12:57.767
It always helps me.

13:05.933 --> 13:07.200
ou're here about my car?Y

13:07.233 --> 13:08.867
Yes, ma'am.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.700
We're following up on your
report that it was stolen.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.400
When did you notice your
car was missing?

13:12.433 --> 13:15.300
This morning.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.500
Did your son take
car without asking

13:17.533 --> 13:19.067
or did he take
after you said

13:19.067 --> 13:21.267
and now you're
teaching him a less

13:21.300 --> 13:22.733
I'm done talking
with you.

13:22.767 --> 13:26.100
Your son is in trouble a
it's going to get worse.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.167
He's going to get hu

13:28.200 --> 13:30.433
Doesn't that worry y

13:30.467 --> 13:32.767
I can't worry
about him anymore.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.733
He's worn me out.

13:34.767 --> 13:37.600
Don't you wish sometimes yo
could turn off the worry?

13:37.633 --> 13:43.833
But you

13:43.867 --> 13:45.767
Where's he headed?

13:45.800 --> 13:48.267
I didn't ask.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.900
I said I didn't care.

13:50.933 --> 13:54.567
I threw him out and
that tramp, Olivia.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.067
And you know what?
I don't care.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.700
He's broken my heart
too many times.

13:58.733 --> 14:01.100
He drove his father away.

14:01.133 --> 14:04.367
I told him not to come back,
and I won't take him back.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.267
I'm sorry for
pain, I truly

14:08.300 --> 14:09.900
But what's more importan

14:09.933 --> 14:14.900
Defending your pride or
protecting your grandbab

14:14.933 --> 14:22.267
Doesn't that baby deser
a fighting chance?

14:22.300 --> 14:24.200
Call Jill at county and
tell her to make it right.

14:24.233 --> 14:26.133
We need to get those
plans through.

14:26.167 --> 14:29.133
Now or we'll be building
these houses in the snow.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.333
Hang on one sec.

14:30.367 --> 14:32.800
Lunch!

14:32.833 --> 14:34.767
Yeah, all right.

14:34.800 --> 14:40.067
I'll be in the office
tomorrow... bye.

14:45.933 --> 14:47.633
Wow,

14:47.667 --> 14:49.633
You like my tacos.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.733
Sure,

14:52.767 --> 14:54.700
you only make
tacos for spec

14:54.733 --> 15:04.833
Jeff!

15:04.833 --> 15:12.667
Jeff!

15:12.700 --> 15:13.667
I'll get Cameron...

15:13.700 --> 15:14.967
No, it's all right.

15:15.067 --> 15:17.600
Cam! Come on buddy.

15:17.633 --> 15:20.667
My tacos are a dish
best served warm.

15:20.700 --> 15:28.300
Whatever.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.367
Rachel.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.567
God is great, God is good,
let us thank Him for our food.

15:34.600 --> 15:41.933
And please watch over Mom in the
field and over Uncle Tim in...

15:41.967 --> 15:43.733
And Uncle Tim... amen.

15:43.767 --> 15:44.833
Amen.

15:44.867 --> 15:48.800
Amen.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.433
Prison.

15:50.467 --> 15:53.467
That's the word
you're looking for.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.367
The place your
mom put my dad.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.333
Prison.

15:59.367 --> 16:05.833
I feel sick.

16:05.867 --> 16:07.800
I feel sick, too.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.833
No you don't,
sit down.

16:10.867 --> 16:13.067
Your life stinks right now,
but my tacos are awesome.

16:13.067 --> 16:27.367
Preach!

16:27.400 --> 16:34.133
Right?!

16:34.167 --> 16:37.433
Mr. Nelson, I'm Detective
Stewart, Crestview PD.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.333
This is my partner,
Detective McLean.

16:39.367 --> 16:44.733
I paid those tickets and docked
my delivery guy for them.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.700
Sally!

16:46.733 --> 16:47.967
Is this your
daughter Olivia?

16:48.067 --> 16:52.200
Sally!

16:52.233 --> 16:54.067
What hap

16:54.067 --> 16:55.467
We're still trying to
piece that together.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.767
Olivia.
Was there an accident?

16:57.800 --> 16:59.300
She's been hurt.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.800
We want to find her
and Trey Harkness

17:00.833 --> 17:02.233
so we can help her.

17:02.267 --> 17:04.200
You don't know where she is,
but you know she's hurt?

17:04.233 --> 17:05.633
Your daughter and
Trey Harkness

17:05.667 --> 17:10.533
were involved in a
robbery this morning.

17:10.567 --> 17:12.333
I'm gonna kill that bo

17:12.367 --> 17:14.500
Olivia has been injured.

17:14.533 --> 17:17.733
We want to find her and get
her the help she needs.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.733
We don'
where s

17:19.767 --> 17:22.400
Because she tol
she was pregnan

17:22.433 --> 17:25.500
And somebody said
was a disappointme

17:25.533 --> 17:29.100
Somebody said she'd have to
choose between us and that boy.

17:29.133 --> 17:34.367
Well she chose, didn't she?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.833
You wouldn't turn her
out with nothing.

17:36.867 --> 17:42.533
You're not that kind of father,
that kind of man, are you?

17:42.567 --> 17:45.667
I gave her my debit card.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.467
I'm glad to hear it.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.300
That's going to help
us get them home.

17:49.333 --> 18:00.967
Olivia and the baby.

18:01.067 --> 18:05.467
Hey guys!

18:09.100 --> 18:10.533
I'm going next door
to help Mrs. Williams.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.267
Her garage door is stuck.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.133
We won't burn the ho
down while you're go

18:14.167 --> 18:24.200
Appreciate that.

18:24.200 --> 18:29.900
Appreciate that.

18:29.933 --> 18:32.400
Okay...
thank you very much.

18:32.433 --> 18:34.933
No hits on the pharmacist's
car or dad's debit card.

18:34.967 --> 18:37.467
Looks like they're
playing smart.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.800
You checking your
dating profile?

18:39.833 --> 18:41.633
Come look.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.167
It's one of Olivia's accounts.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.900
She left it wide open.

18:44.933 --> 18:48.400
There's a lot of photos of
Olivia and Trey with this guy.

18:48.433 --> 18:51.367
He's tagged as Trey's cousin,
Scott Jackson.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.700
Local?

18:52.733 --> 18:57.933
His profile says Seattle.
No contact info.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.800
They've got some horses.

18:59.833 --> 19:01.367
Looks like a farm to m

19:01.400 --> 19:02.967
So not downtown.

19:03.067 --> 19:05.233
That would
zoning pro

19:05.267 --> 19:10.133
Wait, I know that bridge.

19:10.167 --> 19:12.600
That's the... on the
Sammamish River Trail.

19:12.633 --> 19:15.100
And that bridge is
further down the river.

19:15.133 --> 19:16.267
So they like bridg

19:16.300 --> 19:20.500
That's one is summer
and this one's winter.

19:20.533 --> 19:22.333
So they go there a l

19:22.367 --> 19:24.900
Maybe because the f
is near the river.

19:24.933 --> 19:26.933
Gotta make sure the
departments out that way

19:26.967 --> 19:30.167
got the alert and know
to be on the lookout.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.667
I'll call around and
they don't know Scot

19:31.700 --> 19:33.200
I'll check
the city cl

19:33.233 --> 19:34.400
I'll take DMV.

19:34.433 --> 19:35.533
Scott Jackson?

19:35.567 --> 19:48.700
Yep.

19:48.733 --> 19:54.967
Hey!

19:55.067 --> 19:58.100
I didn't see
him get up.

19:58.133 --> 20:07.733
Cam?

20:07.767 --> 20:11.433
Detective Mc

20:11.467 --> 20:13.200
Cameron, wha
you doing he

20:13.233 --> 20:14.700
Where's my father?

20:14.733 --> 20:17.133
Cameron... hi, again.

20:17.167 --> 20:20.867
I'm your aunt's partner,
Devin Stewart.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.833
Where's my father?

20:22.867 --> 20:24.367
Detective Stewart i
offering you his ha

20:24.400 --> 20:25.633
Show some manners, pleas

20:25.667 --> 20:29.400
Stop telling me what to do!

20:29.433 --> 20:30.467
Come on...

20:30.500 --> 20:34.500
Don't touch me... dad!

20:34.533 --> 20:36.867
Dad!

20:36.900 --> 20:38.433
Get in there.

20:38.467 --> 20:40.967
Dev, call Matt?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.267
You gonna lecture me
about respect,

20:42.300 --> 20:43.733
after what you did to
your own brother?

20:43.767 --> 20:44.967
How messed up is that?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.833
Sit down.

20:46.867 --> 20:48.367
Where's my father?

20:48.400 --> 20:50.400
Cameron, you know me
better than that.

20:50.433 --> 20:59.200
Do not test me.

20:59.233 --> 21:02.267
First, you will not
disrespect this station

21:02.300 --> 21:04.300
or the people
in it, clear?

21:04.333 --> 21:06.533
Let me see my father a
I'll go away, far away

21:06.567 --> 21:09.400
That's not possible.

21:09.433 --> 21:10.800
Haven't you
punished me eno

21:10.833 --> 21:12.167
You got what you wante

21:12.200 --> 21:14.600
why can't I hav
little, tiny br

21:14.633 --> 21:17.200
You think this
is what I wanted?

21:17.233 --> 21:18.733
For my brother?

21:18.767 --> 21:20.067
You could've lo
the other way.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.567
Cops do it all the tim

21:21.600 --> 21:33.233
What did I say
about respect?

21:33.267 --> 21:36.767
You can't see him
because he's already

21:36.800 --> 21:44.300
been transferred
to the prison.

21:44.333 --> 21:45.200
We hoped it would be
different, Cameron.

21:45.233 --> 21:53.733
different, Cameron.

21:53.767 --> 21:58.500
I want to go hom

21:58.533 --> 22:08.633
But I don't
where that

22:08.633 --> 22:15.400
But I don't
where that

22:15.433 --> 22:17.800
hy are we getting lecturedW
when
ameron's the one who split?C

22:17.833 --> 22:19.500
Because you're supposed to be
looking out for each other.

22:19.533 --> 22:20.500
For how much longer?

22:20.533 --> 22:21.567
Always.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.967
Exc

22:23.067 --> 22:24.733
What dad means is family
always looks out for each other.

22:24.767 --> 22:26.767
But how much longer are
we going to be here?

22:26.800 --> 22:29.433
We're still
figuring that out.

22:29.467 --> 22:31.467
I want to go back to
school tomorrow.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.633
Are you sure?

22:32.667 --> 22:34.233
It's fine.

22:34.267 --> 22:36.333
We're not the only kids at our
school with dads in prison.

22:36.367 --> 22:39.100
We still don't have to
tweet that to the world.

22:39.133 --> 22:42.367
I can drop you off
on my way to work.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.700
Actually why don't you take
Jeff and Rachel to their school,

22:44.733 --> 22:46.900
and I'll take Cam and
Mariah to theirs.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.133
Why?

22:48.167 --> 22:49.433
I'd like to talk to
your principal.

22:49.467 --> 22:51.500
So you can tell him
I'm a flight risk?

22:51.533 --> 22:53.133
Is that necess

22:53.167 --> 22:55.467
So are we all ground
or just Cameron?

22:55.500 --> 22:58.067
You're not grounded,
you're all on notice.

22:58.067 --> 23:00.133
In this house, we all
watch out for each other.

23:00.167 --> 23:02.067
Remember that.

23:02.067 --> 23:03.533
Then are we

23:03.567 --> 23:05.433
I have a test in AP Calc
tomorrow and I need to study

23:05.467 --> 23:06.667
And I have a history paper.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.067
I have Spanish.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.667
You're excused.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.400
I'm going to heat up dinner
for mom and Cam.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.967
You guys go ahead.

23:13.067 --> 23:23.067
I'll start digging my
escape tunnel after I eat.

23:23.067 --> 23:35.067
I'll start digging my
escape tunnel after I eat.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.933
Can I have a little
space, please?

23:36.967 --> 23:38.067
I'm trying to study.

23:38.100 --> 23:43.333
No, you're

23:43.367 --> 23:46.600
What do we do

23:46.633 --> 23:47.800
We study.

23:47.833 --> 23:51.500
I mean about
Cameron and Mar

23:51.533 --> 23:53.467
He's in my room beca
he needed a place

23:53.500 --> 23:54.933
to practice
oral book re

23:54.967 --> 23:56.467
And she's i
shower, sin

23:56.500 --> 24:00.800
Or screaming,
can't really t

24:00.833 --> 24:04.567
So what do w

24:04.600 --> 24:08.567
We don't do anything.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.500
Mom and Dad'll figure out the
best place for them to go.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.667
But, in the meanti

24:13.700 --> 24:16.067
It won't be long.

24:16.067 --> 24:21.100
We should be patient and nice.

24:21.133 --> 24:23.833
It's pretty awful.

24:23.867 --> 24:27.767
Can you imagine?

24:27.800 --> 24:34.167
No, not at

24:34.200 --> 24:39.267
Thankfully.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.933
I went next door to help Tara.

24:40.967 --> 24:42.300
What was I supposed to do?

24:42.333 --> 24:43.967
I didn't know he
was gonna bolt.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.867
You want us to hunker with
the doors locked

24:45.900 --> 24:47.067
because this kid
is acting out?

24:47.067 --> 24:48.433
Of cours

24:48.467 --> 24:49.933
I'm doing the best
I can, Allison.

24:49.967 --> 24:51.200
I can't do it myself.

24:51.233 --> 24:53.667
I know, but I just
caught a case.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.300
And I'm in the middle
of a house.

24:55.333 --> 24:56.833
These kids need help,
but so do we.

24:56.867 --> 24:58.067
I can't stop thinking about

24:58.067 --> 25:00.333
what's going to happen
to them in foster care.

25:00.367 --> 25:02.133
That's a discussion you
should've had with your brother

25:02.167 --> 25:03.733
when he said he didn't
want us to take them.

25:03.767 --> 25:05.067
He was angry.

25:05.067 --> 25:07.067
Tim has been angry
for about 20 years.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.633
Can we not go there
right now?

25:08.667 --> 25:10.367
Fine, where can go?

25:10.400 --> 25:15.667
I don't know.

25:15.700 --> 25:18.133
You really think we can
look after all four?

25:18.167 --> 25:20.867
And do it well?

25:20.900 --> 25:30.933
I feel like we just got back
on an even keel since...

25:30.967 --> 25:34.400
It wouldn't be easy,
but it would be right.

25:34.433 --> 25:37.300
What about m
What about s

25:37.333 --> 25:39.133
What about how
kids feel about

25:39.167 --> 25:41.067
I don't know.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.167
And I hate not
having the answers.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.733
And I don't like
being the bad guy.

25:44.767 --> 25:49.100
I don't want to be anybody's
enemy, especially yours.

25:49.133 --> 25:54.067
We're not enemies, bab

25:54.067 --> 25:55.767
But if we don't do
right by these kids,

25:55.800 --> 25:57.567
they'll be lost.

25:57.600 --> 25:58.600
Allison

26:00.867 --> 26:01.833
Leave it.

26:01.867 --> 26:06.800
It's Devin, I gotta get it.

26:06.833 --> 26:07.933
Hello?

26:07.967 --> 26:09.433
Hey, I know it's
been a dark day,

26:09.467 --> 26:11.233
but I might have
a little light.

26:11.267 --> 26:13.467
I thought you would
be with Arielle?

26:13.500 --> 26:15.367
No, she's with
her mom tonight.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.633
Listen, Scott Jackson
has no criminal record.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.933
e no longer lives at theH
address on his driver's
license.

26:20.967 --> 26:22.700
But I did a bit of digging,

26:22.733 --> 26:25.267
and I found a property in
Woodinville zoned as farmland,

26:25.300 --> 26:27.167
registered to the names
listed with DMV

26:27.200 --> 26:29.067
as Scott's emergency contacts.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.300
He moved back in with Mom
and Dad - that's great.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.267
We should-

26:32.300 --> 26:34.600
First thing in the morning.

26:34.633 --> 26:36.467
Banging on his door at
night might not be

26:36.500 --> 26:37.967
the best way to persuade
Scott to cooperate.

26:38.067 --> 26:40.567
Right, see you
bright and early.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.933
Get some sleep.

26:41.967 --> 26:52.067
You too. Night.

26:52.067 --> 27:05.233
You too. Night.

27:05.267 --> 27:07.467
Did you find the
collectible?

27:07.500 --> 27:13.633
On this

27:13.667 --> 27:15.800
Go over
ordinanc

27:15.833 --> 27:17.900
Tr

28:04.133 --> 28:07.067
Man, I can't even think of the
last time I saw Trey.

28:07.067 --> 28:10.733
Couple of months maybe?

28:10.767 --> 28:13.533
All had to sing "Happy
Birthday" to Nana, y'know?

28:13.567 --> 28:19.700
That's funny because this
picture was three weeks ago.

28:19.733 --> 28:23.200
Or is this your other
cousin Trey?

28:23.233 --> 28:24.733
Maybe I just lost track,
y'know?

28:24.767 --> 28:26.600
You ever do that,
you get all busy

28:26.633 --> 28:28.533
and it seems like forever,
but it wasn't?

28:28.567 --> 28:32.767
No.

28:32.800 --> 28:36.600
How long have these tire
tracks been here, Scott?

28:36.633 --> 28:42.833
They look like they belong
to a 2012 Lexus RX 350.

28:42.867 --> 28:45.633
A red one, but
I'm no expert.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.733
We need a crime
scene team.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.300
Why?

28:49.333 --> 28:52.500
This isn't a crime scene.

28:52.533 --> 28:56.367
If these tracks match t
ones from the stolen ca

28:56.400 --> 29:03.800
we're looking for, that'
going to be hard to prov

29:03.833 --> 29:05.833
Trey was here yesterday.

29:05.867 --> 29:08.200
He showed up before dinner,
he sold me a gun.

29:08.233 --> 29:09.767
He needed some quick cash.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.867
I'd rather have the car, but
I don't got that kind of money.

29:12.900 --> 29:14.467
We're gonna need
that gun, Scott.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.800
And a full statement.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.567
What kind of statement?

29:17.600 --> 29:19.400
One that helps us
figure out whether

29:19.433 --> 29:21.467
you're an accessory before
or after the fact.

29:21.500 --> 29:24.233
I'm not an accessory
to nothing.

29:24.267 --> 29:26.200
All he said was
he needed cash.

29:26.233 --> 29:27.933
Him and his girlfriend
were getting outta town

29:27.967 --> 29:28.967
because her
parents hate him.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.267
Was she with him?

29:30.300 --> 29:31.567
Yeah, but she's not
feeling too good,

29:31.600 --> 29:34.667
so they have to
lay low for a bit.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.767
So I gave him some money.

29:36.800 --> 29:43.733
all pregnant.

29:43.767 --> 29:45.767
Where'd you
them, Scott

29:45.800 --> 29:46.533
Nowhere.

29:46.567 --> 29:47.933
Judge Walker, please.

29:47.967 --> 29:49.333
No! Wait!

29:49.367 --> 29:52.733
Just a minute.

29:52.767 --> 29:55.167
Come on Scott, you're goi
for a ride either way.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.833
To jail or to T

29:57.867 --> 30:01.133
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo

30:01.167 --> 30:11.200
You

30:11.200 --> 30:22.833
You

30:22.867 --> 30:24.367
We're right behind you.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.333
But my hand to
heaven, Scott,

30:26.367 --> 30:27.933
if you lose your mind
and this goes poorly,

30:27.967 --> 30:29.333
you're gonna have
to answer to me.

30:29.367 --> 30:39.400
Trust me, you do not
want to cross this woman.

30:39.400 --> 31:01.767
Trust me, you do not
want to cross this woman.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.167
Yo! Trey!

31:03.200 --> 31:04.867
It's me, Scott.

31:04.900 --> 31:07.400
Stop right there man!

31:07.433 --> 31:10.433
You better be alone,
you worthless sack of scum.

31:10.467 --> 31:12.367
Screw you, man!

31:12.400 --> 31:16.067
Whaddya want, Scott?

31:16.067 --> 31:17.733
I came to check on
you and Olivia,

31:17.767 --> 31:19.067
make sure you were okay.

31:19.067 --> 31:24.800
But now, forget that.

31:24.833 --> 31:28.467
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:28.500 --> 31:38.533
Don't go, come on in.

31:38.533 --> 32:00.533
Don't go, come on in.

32:00.567 --> 32:03.967
Lord have mercy, man.

32:04.067 --> 32:08.100
Drop the gun! Drop it!

32:08.133 --> 32:15.100
Now!

32:15.133 --> 32:18.233
Everyone I
is a liar.

32:18.267 --> 32:19.433
llison McLean.

32:19.467 --> 32:22.833
Where are you hit?

32:22.867 --> 32:24.833
What happened here?
Where's Olivia?

32:24.867 --> 32:26.167
In Hell, I hope.

32:26.200 --> 32:30.600
Dude!
Last night you loved her.

32:30.633 --> 32:35.067
Yeah, well,
tonight she shot

32:35.067 --> 32:36.600
You look so surprised.

32:36.633 --> 32:38.833
She had me fooled t

32:38.867 --> 32:40.200
But it's the princ
who's been

32:40.233 --> 32:43.667
calling the
this whole t

32:43.700 --> 32:47.067
Tell us what happened,
Trey, now.

32:47.100 --> 32:49.533
She said I
disappointm

32:49.567 --> 32:52.400
My plan wa
disappoint

32:52.433 --> 32:58.300
She took the gun a
said she was leavi

32:58.333 --> 33:07.133
When I tried to
her, she shot me

33:07.167 --> 33:12.100
She said she was gonna eras
all her disappointments

33:12.133 --> 33:19.267
and start a fa
from scratch.

33:19.300 --> 33:21.500
Scott, help me get him
to the car.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.367
We can't wait for
the ambulance.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.800
Lieutenant, this is Stewart.

33:24.833 --> 33:26.233
We need a detail
assembled right away.

33:26.267 --> 33:27.467
You think I'm gonna die?

33:27.500 --> 33:29.833
No, we think Olivia's
gonna kill someone.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.600
You need to say
you're sorry!

33:40.633 --> 33:42.233
We are, sweetheart.

33:42.267 --> 33:45.200
Him! I want him!

33:47.067 --> 33:50.067
She asked you
to go away!

33:50.067 --> 33:52.200
Mr. and Mrs. Nelson.

33:52.233 --> 33:54.067
It's Allison McLean
and Devin Stewart.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.767
The detectives you
spoke toearlier.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.267
I'll shoot you
through the door!

33:58.300 --> 34:00.800
Olivia, I know you're
a good shot.

34:00.833 --> 34:03.167
I saw what you
did to Trey.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.600
But you need to understand.

34:04.633 --> 34:07.733
My entire department
is in the parking lot.

34:07.767 --> 34:09.400
You shoot, they're
gonna crash in here,

34:09.433 --> 34:16.200
open up, and none
of us walk away, okay?

34:16.233 --> 34:19.600
So I'm gonna come in here
and we're gonna talk.

34:19.633 --> 34:22.500
I've got my partner with me
and he's got a gun,

34:22.533 --> 34:28.567
because that's how we
do things.

34:28.600 --> 34:37.067
Don't panic, okay?

34:37.067 --> 34:39.100
Mr. and Mrs. Nelson,
are you all right?

34:39.133 --> 34:41.400
They're fine.

34:41.433 --> 34:43.200
Olivia, how are you?

34:43.233 --> 34:49.167
That leg doesn't look good.

34:49.200 --> 34:51.867
Is Trey alive?

34:51.900 --> 34:55.233
He is.

34:55.267 --> 34:57.067
How's the baby?

34:57.067 --> 34:58.967
Must be fine.

34:59.067 --> 35:01.533
I'm still sick
as all get out.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.733
That'll get better.

35:03.767 --> 35:05.533
No it won't.

35:05.567 --> 35:07.567
Nothing will.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.300
Honey it will be,
I promise.

35:09.333 --> 35:10.900
Mrs. Nelson...

35:10.933 --> 35:13.567
Mothers shouldn't make promises
they can't keep.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.900
Olivia knows there will
be consequences.

35:15.933 --> 35:18.133
It was Trey's plan.

35:18.167 --> 35:21.600
No, no.

35:21.633 --> 35:24.933
Shooting your father is your
plan, and your plan alone.

35:24.967 --> 35:27.633
A bad one.

35:27.667 --> 35:32.233
Olivia, look at

35:32.267 --> 35:35.400
Think past this mome

35:35.433 --> 35:37.367
Shooting him is foreve

35:37.400 --> 35:39.067
For you, your

35:39.067 --> 35:41.967
And it's not gonna
make anything bett

35:42.067 --> 35:43.800
You're gonna have
to live with the dam

35:43.833 --> 35:47.833
you've done in
moment of ange

35:47.867 --> 35:50.600
You can't do this, you'
not gonna do this.

35:50.633 --> 35:51.833
I can't...

35:51.867 --> 35:55.467
You can... you

35:55.500 --> 36:00.700
For the sake of
baby, you have t

36:00.733 --> 36:02.633
Be strong.

36:02.667 --> 36:11.133
Put the gun down and
forgive your father.

36:11.167 --> 36:13.067
I'm so sorry, Olivia.

36:13.067 --> 36:23.233
So sorry.

36:26.833 --> 36:30.267
You did the right thing.

36:30.300 --> 36:34.500
But you're still
under arrest.

36:34.533 --> 36:38.433
You have the right to
remain silent.

36:38.467 --> 36:40.067
Anything you say
can and will be

36:40.100 --> 36:41.600
used against you in
a court of law.

36:41.633 --> 36:51.667
You have the right
to an attorney...

36:51.667 --> 36:58.933
You have the right
to an attorney...

37:39.500 --> 37:43.633
Anything I say is going
sound stupid and hollow.

37:43.667 --> 37:46.433
Try me.

37:46.467 --> 37:48.900
I'm sor
came to

37:48.933 --> 37:52.533
Right again, as always.

37:52.567 --> 37:54.067
I might have wa
a little longer

37:54.100 --> 37:55.533
to give us both
chance to cool

37:55.567 --> 37:57.067
I don't plan on
cooling off.

37:57.067 --> 38:05.167
I need to talk to you..
about Mariah and Camero

38:05.200 --> 38:07.800
Did Child Services find
a good place for them?

38:07.833 --> 38:09.900
N

38:09.933 --> 38:13.900
Another string you
refused to pull?

38:13.933 --> 38:16.167
I want t
live wit

38:16.200 --> 38:17.067
No.

38:17.100 --> 38:18.667
It's the best pl

38:18.700 --> 38:21.400
I'd rather have them
in an orphanage.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.733
Go ahead and hate

38:23.767 --> 38:26.267
But don't hurt your children
any more than you already have,

38:26.300 --> 38:28.267
just to get back at

38:28.300 --> 38:30.233
They'll only be in the system
until Jackie gets home.

38:30.267 --> 38:32.433
Because Jackie's go
able to care for th

38:32.467 --> 38:34.833
House them and
hold them toget

38:34.867 --> 38:37.067
Shut up.

38:37.067 --> 38:40.167
I love Mariah and Camero

38:40.200 --> 38:41.967
They don't believe
and neither do you

38:42.067 --> 38:47.633
but all I want is
what's best for th

38:47.667 --> 38:56.600
Well, I'd say you're
off to a great start.

38:56.633 --> 38:59.100
I'll fight you for the

38:59.133 --> 39:00.833
What?

39:00.867 --> 39:03.233
If I have to
I'll go to c

39:03.267 --> 39:05.833
I'll have you and Jack
declared unfit parents

39:05.867 --> 39:07.433
and Matt and I will beco
their legal guardians.

39:07.467 --> 39:09.333
Stop... stop.

39:09.367 --> 39:10.567
Sto

39:10.600 --> 39:12.800
Stop all of it.

39:12.833 --> 39:14.900
You take a bullet
for your partner.

39:14.933 --> 39:18.133
You think you're gonna
pick who raises my kids?

39:18.167 --> 39:20.367
Who told you to
save the world?

39:20.400 --> 39:23.467
Who told y
give up, D

39:23.500 --> 39:25.067
We're done here!

39:25.100 --> 39:34.533
You try this, I will fight
you every step of the way.

39:48.500 --> 39:50.200
Thanks for picking up
dinner, baby.

39:50.233 --> 39:51.800
Sorry I was
long day.

39:51.833 --> 39:52.833
Did you close your case?

39:54.200 --> 39:55.733
Want to talk about it?

39:55.767 --> 39:59.167
N

39:59.200 --> 40:00.867
So how was every
else's day?

40:00.900 --> 40:04.000
I think I did pretty good
on my AP Calc test.

40:04.033 --> 40:05.967
Mike wants to know
I can take my keybo

40:06.000 --> 40:08.633
over to his house tomorr
night so we can jam.

40:08.667 --> 40:11.000
Just don't drop it,
rock star.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.633
Mariah, how was your da

40:12.667 --> 40:14.500
Fine.

40:14.533 --> 40:17.200
I got a B on my
Spanish presentation.

40:17.233 --> 40:19.033
Felicitaciones!

40:19.067 --> 40:21.633
Gracias.

40:21.667 --> 40:26.067
Cameron?

40:26.100 --> 40:28.067
When's Child Services coming?

40:34.267 --> 40:36.433
They're not.

40:36.467 --> 40:40.000
You're staying here with us.

40:40.033 --> 40:41.667
Your uncle Matt and
I talked about it,

40:41.700 --> 40:44.833
and we think it would be best
if you stayed here with us.

40:44.867 --> 40:46.300
But Dad said that-

40:46.333 --> 40:48.733
I know and there's still stuff
we need to work out

40:48.767 --> 40:50.200
with your dad,
legal stuff mostly.

40:50.233 --> 40:51.967
For how long?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.533
Just until M
gets back, r

40:54.567 --> 40:56.733
Probabl

40:56.767 --> 40:58.533
The girls can bu
up in Rachel's r

40:58.567 --> 41:00.500
and the boys in Jeff

41:00.533 --> 41:05.067
Maybe dad can build something
to make more space.

41:05.100 --> 41:08.233
Yeah... like we can build
out those window seats.

41:08.267 --> 41:11.167
You guys can help
with that.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.533
I know this is sudden and it's
been a tough couple of days.

41:14.567 --> 41:16.133
But we'll figure it out.

41:16.167 --> 41:27.567
I need to be excused.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.333
Maybe we can get
you moved over

41:29.367 --> 41:31.567
to Jeff and Rachel's school
in time for Monday.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.567
Why do we ha
change schoo

41:33.600 --> 41:36.367
It makes sense that you
go to the neighborhood school.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.267
And we'll fit right in.

41:38.300 --> 41:44.900
May I be exc

41:44.933 --> 41:46.833
I'll go check on her.

41:46.867 --> 42:01.400
Because, y'know, that's what
family does for each other.

42:01.433 --> 42:03.967
We didn't even get a vote?

42:04.067 --> 42:05.900
Can you work
me here, ple

42:05.933 --> 42:06.800
Why?

42:06.833 --> 42:09.100
Because I'm asking you t

42:09.133 --> 42:09.967
Because I'm asking you t

42:10.067 --> 42:11.400
Right.

42:11.433 --> 42:14.400
Like we're the ones you
need to worry about.
