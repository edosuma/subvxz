WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:03.378
Previously onSEAL Team...I don't think that I can be

00:03.430 --> 00:05.512
with you anymore.
I'm sorry.

00:05.570 --> 00:11.008
Andres Doza, the head of the
most lethal cartel in Mexico.

00:11.050 --> 00:14.349
He_ executed
an American DEA agent.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.833
MARTINEZ: Lieutenant Lopez
is not going on this raid.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.359
It's too dangerous.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.311
I'm from Telporo.
I'm known there.

00:19.360 --> 00:20.964
Hard to trust a soldier
who doesn't fight.

00:22.840 --> 00:23.750
It's good to see
you reconsidered.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.288
Stand by, exfil and SSE.

00:32.330 --> 00:33.672
Collect all phones
and anything you can find.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.676
We don't move now,

00:35.730 --> 00:37.209
the HVT is gone.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.683
Why isn't Jason pursuing?

00:38.730 --> 00:40.072
Well, the target
was Gonzalez.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.246
Are you questioning me
right now, Mandy?

00:41.300 --> 00:43.814
We don't stand a
chance of getting Doza

00:43.860 --> 00:45.555
if your head
is back home.

00:45.610 --> 00:46.907
Give me the phones.Here you go.

00:46.950 --> 00:49.168
That's from Doza.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.913
"Muerta."

00:52.960 --> 00:55.087
Marked for death.
My family.

00:55.140 --> 00:56.744
Now do you understand?

01:21.640 --> 01:23.335
Morning.

01:23.380 --> 01:25.371
Hey.

01:27.950 --> 01:32.250
You, uh...
you sleep last night?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.916
Did I sleep last night?

01:34.960 --> 01:37.872
Whoa...
Ah, just worked on
my Cirque du Soleil

01:37.920 --> 01:39.478
routine all night.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.486
l\_lext time_I'l|
bring my Wires.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.353
Yeah.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.358
Now that's
the Jason Hayes I know.

01:47.410 --> 01:50.447
Always turning to a synthesis
of circus dance styles

01:50.500 --> 01:51.842
to ease your mind.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.800
Thinking about
Mike and Emma?

01:55.850 --> 01:57.545
Yeah.

01:59.110 --> 02:02.159
You got a lot
going on, brother.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.158
Doesn't leave a lot of time
for yourself, you know, you...

02:05.210 --> 02:07.019
you to process
all you've been through.

02:07.820 --> 02:09.902
Got to have a clear head
for this mission.

02:11.950 --> 02:12.996
What's that mean?

02:15.350 --> 02:17.341
I'm clear.

02:17.390 --> 02:18.698
I'm crystal clear.

02:18.740 --> 02:20.958
I know.

02:21.010 --> 02:25.743
But you blaming yourself for
Lopez's situation does not help.

02:25.790 --> 02:27.701
See, I challenged Lopez
and he took the bait.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.924
And now the man's family
is marked for death.

02:30.970 --> 02:34.406
That's just war, brother.

02:34.450 --> 02:36.793
Bad things happen
to good people.

02:36.850 --> 02:39.148
Lord knows we've seen
plenty of that, right?

02:39.200 --> 02:42.021
But you get yourself
personally involved

02:42.070 --> 02:43.844
in trying to change
that reality,

02:43.900 --> 02:46.027
there's no way we can
get the job done.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.069
Yeah.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.379
Oh, work calls.

03:09.710 --> 03:12.053
ERIC:
Right, Bravo 1,
this is Havoc Base.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.352
Continue moving
straight ahead north.

03:14.410 --> 03:15.707
Approximately 400 meters.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.239
JASON :
Copy, Havoc.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.669
We'll update you
once we have eyes on.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.711
Until then,
we're flying blind.

03:21.760 --> 03:25.639
While Doza is popping bottles,
living like a royal,

03:25.680 --> 03:27.932
we're cooped up in this van
looking for a burner phone.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.764
RAY: Looks like all
the numbers we got

03:29.810 --> 03:31.243
off the phones
in the Gonzalez raid

03:31.290 --> 03:33.815
were dead within an hour
except this one.

03:33.860 --> 03:35.646
Whoever owns this cell,

03:35.690 --> 03:37.419
they're connected
to Andres Doza.

03:37.470 --> 03:39.199
It's a good lead.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.479
I still got a bad feeling.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.080
You and your bad feelings.

03:45.130 --> 03:46.734
All right, 100 meters.

03:46.790 --> 03:50.009
From your 12 o'clock,
you'll hit a market square.

03:50.050 --> 03:52.006
Phone's pinging
from that location.

03:53.230 --> 03:54.618
You follow the guy

03:54.660 --> 03:56.662
who has that phone,
he'll lead us right to Doza.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.749
DAVIS:
He's moving pretty slow, sir.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.234
It appears
the HVT's on foot.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.932
Bravo 1, be advised.
HVT is likely on foot.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.935
You see anything?

04:08.980 --> 04:10.971
Yeah, I see a lot of things.

04:11.030 --> 04:12.759
How are we supposed
to know who this guy is?

04:12.810 --> 04:13.936
Havoc, we got
nothing out here.

04:13.990 --> 04:14.979
Anything else
you can give us?

04:15.030 --> 04:17.760
Bravo 1, we read his location

04:17.820 --> 04:19.947
as 70 meters north of your pos.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.082
60 meters.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.875
30 meters.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.749
All right, boys.
We're here.

04:37.790 --> 04:39.667
Here.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.499
Right here.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.027
Havoc, this is 1,
we're pursuing on foot.

04:56.070 --> 04:57.981
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

04:58.030 --> 05:00.339
HVT appears to be
15 meters north

05:00.380 --> 05:02.371
of your position;
you should see him.

05:46.780 --> 05:47.724
Havoc, this is 1.

05:47.780 --> 05:48.815
Dial his phone to positively

05:48.870 --> 05:50.474
I.D. him when he picks up.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.249
All we have is a phone number.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.904
If we dial it,
we might spook him.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.211
Doesn't matter.

05:55.260 --> 05:56.431
If you don't dial him,
we're gonna lose him.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.038
Dial it. There's too many
people out here.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.746
He's right.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.746
Is he?

06:06.270 --> 06:09.626
All right, Bravo 1, stand by.
We're making the call.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.104
Monero, call
the target's cell phone,

06:12.150 --> 06:14.710
make sure that that caller ID.
reads "unknown."

06:14.760 --> 06:17.103
Roger that, sir. Stand by.

06:17.150 --> 06:19.937
All stations,
Havoc Base is gonna dial

06:19.980 --> 06:21.538
the possible HVT.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.808
Key in on anyone
who picks up their phone

06:23.860 --> 06:25.248
and acts in an erratic way.

06:39.740 --> 06:41.264
Bueno.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.130
Got him.

06:43.180 --> 06:46.138
Guy in a blue Armani suit.

06:53.150 --> 06:54.708
In the white Mercedes.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.239
White Mercedes.

07:24.220 --> 07:25.437
JASON:
Havoc, this is 1.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.038
We're following
a white Mercedes.

07:27.090 --> 07:29.263
Possible HVT.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.832
Hello there.

07:38.630 --> 07:40.495
MAN : Yes?Sending a photo in for ID.

07:40.540 --> 07:43.452
Put every FRS resource
on it now.

07:44.980 --> 07:47.062
Bravo 1, maintain eyes on.

07:47.110 --> 07:48.759
A-firm, Havoc.
We still have him.

07:48.810 --> 07:50.596
HVT is in a
white Mercedes.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.119
Trent, watch
your distance.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.503
Check. Backing off.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.298
Havoc, this is 1.
Target is still moving east.

08:02.350 --> 08:04.568
J. On our three.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.616
What's our rules of engagement?

08:18.670 --> 08:21.059
Don't fire
unless fired upon.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.752
Mad-dogging us kind of feels
like engagement to me.

08:32.770 --> 08:36.206
MANDY: Dante Vega.
Born in Guadalajara.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.024
Long rap sheet
for a 30-year-old.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.684
Doza starts them young.

08:39.730 --> 08:41.243
Most of his crimes

08:41.300 --> 08:42.688
link with people
in businesses

08:42.730 --> 08:44.550
with cartel affiliation.

08:44.610 --> 08:46.999
He was caught twice
carrying marked bills.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.567
He must be a bagman
for the cartel.

08:50.610 --> 08:53.522
He collects money
around the city.

08:53.570 --> 08:55.003
This is good.
Yeah.

08:55.050 --> 08:56.483
Follow the money,
it'll lead us

08:56.530 --> 08:58.350
right up the
Doza food chain.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.961
We could lose him
if he turns his phone off.

09:02.010 --> 09:03.966
How long to get a permanent
surveillance team on him?

09:04.020 --> 09:05.442
An hour.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.400
Then Bravo's gonna have to keep
eyes on him until then.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.715
Bravo 1, stay on target

09:11.760 --> 09:14.581
until CISEN can get
surveillance team in place.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.198
JASON :
Roger that. Bravo out.

09:33.130 --> 09:34.347
Havoc, this is 1.

09:34.390 --> 09:35.607
HVT is parked.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.696
Heading into a...

09:39.700 --> 09:41.964
Heading into a club
at our 11 o'clock.

09:44.670 --> 09:46.706
Business registration
is to an LLC called

09:46.760 --> 09:48.625
Las Carpinteras Ertico.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.922
Hmm. Gentlemen's establishment.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.589
It's a strip club.

09:54.630 --> 09:57.360
Finally something
I can be happy about.

09:57.420 --> 09:59.763
We need somebody on the inside
to keep eyes on him.

09:59.810 --> 10:01.892
It's safer to wait for him
to come out, right, boss?

10:01.940 --> 10:04.636
Guy's got to leave the
strip club eventually.

10:04.690 --> 10:06.248
That's debatable.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.336
JASON: Know what, it could be
a ditch point, a back way out,

10:08.390 --> 10:09.721
a tunnel--
it's-it's too risky.

10:09.780 --> 10:12.385
Clay, Sonny,

10:12.430 --> 10:13.829
you're tourists on a bender.

10:13.870 --> 10:16.179
Get inside. Go.

10:16.220 --> 10:18.302
Sending Sonny into
a strip club.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.398
Is that profiling, boss?

10:20.440 --> 10:22.613
My natural habitat there, Clay.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.616
No offense taken.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.709
What do you
say, Sonny?

10:42.770 --> 10:46.410
I say welcome to
the promised land.

10:46.470 --> 10:49.633
American, yes?

10:49.690 --> 10:51.851
Yeah.
Mmm.

10:51.910 --> 10:53.730
You want a dance?

10:53.780 --> 10:55.680
Oh, he's got
a girlfriend. Yeah.

10:55.740 --> 10:56.684
Oh, so do I.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.695
Oh, you do?Yeah.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.959
Well, where is she?

11:02.310 --> 11:05.177
This is why I love
strip clubs.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.188
Bravo 6,
what's your status?

11:21.460 --> 11:23.849
Uh, we got
eyes on him.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.060
JASON:
Check. What's he doing?

11:25.110 --> 11:28.409
Yup, he's, uh,

11:28.470 --> 11:29.801
enjoying the scenery.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.680
He didn't come in here
to lose a tail.

11:31.730 --> 11:34.688
Permanent surveillance team
IS 30 minutes out.

11:34.730 --> 11:36.209
He moves, you let us know.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.251
Copy.

11:39.390 --> 11:41.085
Captain America,

11:41.130 --> 11:43.781
we need to focus
on the target,

11:43.830 --> 11:46.435
not on the
lady, okay?

11:46.480 --> 11:47.959
Come on, just playing
the part, buddy.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.248
SONNY: Bravo 1,
three fighting-age males

12:21.300 --> 12:22.688
just engaged our HVT.

12:22.740 --> 12:24.958
Hold fast, we're coming
to you. Trent.

12:29.530 --> 12:31.009
That's a negative.
We're solid.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.518
The shooters just
went out the back door.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.794
Our HVT was ambushed.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.489
He's down hard.

12:41.540 --> 12:44.100
Stone cold, boss.

12:56.950 --> 13:01.239
SONNY: You know,
if God was trying to cure me of,

13:01.300 --> 13:04.337
you know, strip clubs,
today was a good start.

13:04.390 --> 13:05.778
You know, what's that, uh,

13:05.820 --> 13:08.163
psychological term
that they use?

13:08.220 --> 13:10.825
"Negative association"?Yeah, that's the one.

13:10.870 --> 13:12.952
Yeah, maybe I'll take up
Sunday brunch instead.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.128
"Caf" in Spanish
means "coffee."

13:16.180 --> 13:18.648
You're just a regular Rosetta
Stone, aren't you there, Sonny?

13:18.710 --> 13:21.702
Look at that,
Bam Bam perking up.

13:21.750 --> 13:22.830
Coming out of his funk.
RAY:
Middle-of-the-day hit.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.836
This place is more
Wild West than Texas.

13:24.890 --> 13:28.792
Hey, there's nothing more wild
and West than Texas.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.579
Don't get on my list, Ray.

13:30.630 --> 13:32.848
What the hell happened
out there

13:32.890 --> 13:34.846
Vega didn't turn his phone off.

13:34.900 --> 13:37.585
That's a capital offense
in the Doza Cartel.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.631
Jay, 20,000 soldiers,
and in 24 hours

13:39.680 --> 13:41.819
they managed to weed out
the one dude

13:41.860 --> 13:43.168
that didn't get
with the program.

13:43.210 --> 13:44.814
Those guys are smart
and they don't play soft.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.851
Yeah, but... Mandy
should've seen that coming.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.992
She should have seen
that coming, Ray.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.258
_ It's hard to see
a public execution coming, boss.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.689
You can't fault her for not
being able to see the future.

13:53.740 --> 13:55.173
I can't fault her?

13:55.220 --> 13:58.041
She could've blown our cover.
Doza killed a DEA agent.

13:58.090 --> 14:00.479
I hear you. Look, we all
want to get Doza, brother.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.542
j, ;i:7 43
133%:
3;;
1;:

14:18.590 --> 14:19.761
Need some help?

14:19.810 --> 14:21.983
Yeah, sure.

14:22.030 --> 14:24.078
What you got?

14:24.120 --> 14:25.724
SD, batteries.
Got it.

14:25.770 --> 14:27.761
Thanks.

14:28.820 --> 14:32.039
Hey, you know, I, um,

14:32.080 --> 14:35.379
I never asked you about Danny,
if you were okay.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.044
Well, that's sweet
of you to ask,

14:39.090 --> 14:42.048
but why are you asking now?

14:42.090 --> 14:44.524
Just wondering.Eight months later?

14:44.570 --> 14:46.879
Yeah, you know,
the way that you, uh,

14:46.920 --> 14:48.182
the way you dealt with it,

14:48.230 --> 14:50.448
never complaining, I mean,
even though, I'm sure,

14:50.490 --> 14:51.889
something like that
really hurt.

14:51.930 --> 14:54.660
Yeah, well, it hurt like hell,

14:54.710 --> 14:58.066
but time helps.

14:58.110 --> 14:59.930
Look, I know it's clich,
but it does,

14:59.980 --> 15:03.541
and friends really make
a difference.

15:07.550 --> 15:09.427
Everything okay
with you and Stella?

15:09.470 --> 15:11.904
Perfect.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.110
SONNY:
Eh.

15:13.170 --> 15:14.990
What are you two chuckleheads
talking about?

15:15.040 --> 15:15.995
Nothing.
Nothing.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.031
Oh, it don't sound like nothing.

15:18.090 --> 15:19.079
Sonny, you just creeping
on people,

15:19.130 --> 15:20.381
or do you need something?

15:20.440 --> 15:22.385
Just came to get my hat.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.954
That's right.
Hook 'em, baby!

15:25.010 --> 15:26.875
What, is it always sunny
in Doucheville?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.433
Why you got...?
You got, you got

15:28.490 --> 15:29.878
your glasses on indoors, buddy.Let's go, let's go!
Bye.

15:34.970 --> 15:37.359
ERIC: Only thing they took
was Vega's phone.

15:37.410 --> 15:39.492
Left his bag of cash.

15:39.540 --> 15:40.882
Definitely Doza's men
who killed him.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.453
JASON:
Yeah, well,

15:42.500 --> 15:44.149
seems to me that somebody
should've seen that one coming.

15:44.200 --> 15:48.318
CISEN recovered the Mercedes.
GPS tells a story.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.109
Backlog of addresses.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.025
Multiple visits
to local businesses

15:52.080 --> 15:53.559
likely under Doza's control:

15:53.600 --> 15:55.818
bars, nightclubs,
construction companies.

15:55.860 --> 15:59.478
A-Any private
residences?
RITA: No.

15:59.520 --> 16:03.991
But one business stands out:
uh, the Reyes Talent Agency.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.917
Yes, it's legit and owned by
a very successful businesswoman,

16:06.960 --> 16:08.473
Carla Reyes.

16:08.530 --> 16:10.088
So why's a cartel bagman

16:10.140 --> 16:11.482
stopping by
a business like that?

16:11.530 --> 16:14.090
Don't know, but there
will be a Doza connection.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.311
We just have to
figure it out.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.442
Yeah, figure it out.
We'll just figure it out

16:17.490 --> 16:21.017
right before you send us
into another setup, Mandy.

16:21.060 --> 16:23.051
Average work.
Average.

16:30.940 --> 16:34.637
You know damn well that wasn't
a setup. What the hell was that?

16:34.680 --> 16:37.296
Really? That was me
publicly questioning you.

16:37.340 --> 16:39.114
Why? I'm sorry,
do you not like that?

16:39.170 --> 16:40.114
You don't do that.

16:40.170 --> 16:41.865
Not to me.Oh, not to you? Okay.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.070
You can just
go to Harrington.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.256
You can ask him questions

16:44.300 --> 16:45.699
and doubt my mission
readiness here.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.298
That's fine, right?Different.

16:47.350 --> 16:49.170
Different

16:49.220 --> 16:52.303
That was me doing due diligence.
This was you reacting.

16:52.350 --> 16:54.739
You doubted
my mi55ion readiness.

16:54.790 --> 16:56.178
You doubted that. Why?

16:56.230 --> 16:57.709
Why?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.401
Because you're not
made of steel, Jason.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.099
You lost Alana.

17:02.150 --> 17:04.186
You waved off Mumbai.
You've been away from Ray

17:04.240 --> 17:06.708
for six months.
Why wouldn't I have doubts

17:06.760 --> 17:09.103
about where your head is
at for an op like this?

17:09.150 --> 17:11.106
Next time you have doubts,
just come to me. Right?

17:11.160 --> 17:13.412
Talk to me, talk to me.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.189
Oh, right, because
Team guys are famous

17:15.250 --> 17:16.808
for talking
about their feelings.

17:16.860 --> 17:19.943
I'm sorry, feelings? What do
feelings have to do with this?

17:20.990 --> 17:23.242
You lost your wife, Jason.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.345
Your children have
one parent now.

17:27.390 --> 17:29.733
That feels like
something, right?

17:30.910 --> 17:32.127
I don't know

17:32.180 --> 17:34.216
how those feelings might change

17:34.270 --> 17:37.137
decisions you make in the field.

17:37.180 --> 17:42.186
Look, with DC. and SOCOM
micromanaging this operation,

17:42.230 --> 17:45.757
everything had to be
squared away, including you.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.758
I was doing my job.Just doing your job.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.848
Just let it go.
You're here, right?

17:50.890 --> 17:52.494
Right, I'm here, Mandy.

17:52.540 --> 17:55.156
I'm here with a knife
in my back.

18:15.830 --> 18:17.821
[Abril continues
speaking Spanish]

18:33.280 --> 18:36.625
As the Americans say, huh,
another swing and a miss?

18:40.420 --> 18:43.321
It's not the first time an op's
gone sideways on us, all right?

18:43.380 --> 18:45.371
We'll find a way.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.338
Juan and Abril have been
together for a very long time.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.039
They're childhood
sweethearts.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.809
They're gonna be safe
from Doza here.

18:53.870 --> 18:56.509
I shouldn't have pushed him
to go on the Gonzalez raid.

19:00.830 --> 19:03.298
What's your story, Colonel?
You married?

19:03.350 --> 19:04.305
S.
Yeah.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.304
A wife and a son.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.748
You're not worried
about 'em?

19:06.790 --> 19:07.961
Ah, not anymore.

19:08.010 --> 19:11.059
I sent them to Spain
two years ago,

19:11.100 --> 19:13.056
outside of
Doza's reach.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.709
Ah, safe only because
they're 6,000 miles away

19:18.760 --> 19:20.887
from everything that
they know and they love,

19:20.940 --> 19:22.498
from me.

19:22.550 --> 19:25.371
Meanwhile, Doza is still here.Yeah.

19:25.420 --> 19:27.149
His daughters,
they go to school

19:27.200 --> 19:29.725
maybe six miles
from this very spot.

19:30.730 --> 19:32.721
You have children?

19:34.910 --> 19:36.639
Yeah, I got two.

19:36.690 --> 19:39.215
Their mother,
if she's like my wife,

19:39.260 --> 19:43.048
she's a saint for putting up
with all of this, right?

19:45.400 --> 19:49.268
She is a saint. Too good for me.

19:49.310 --> 19:52.393
They're all too good
for us, Jason.

19:52.450 --> 19:55.795
We'll find him. We'll find him.

20:05.420 --> 20:08.150
Hey, buddy,
what are you doing?

20:08.200 --> 20:11.158
Oh, you know, just trying
to get a little Skinemax.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.940
We should get out of here, man.
Let's go, let's go back downtown

20:13.990 --> 20:16.038
and go hit another club
or something, you know

20:16.080 --> 20:18.389
I don't know if that's
such a good idea there, Fabio.

20:18.430 --> 20:21.945
Come on. You're always hounding
me how I need to get after it.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.479
Let's go.
Let's get after it, buddy.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.600
Come on, let's go.L-Listen,

20:24.650 --> 20:26.299
I hate the fact
you're forcmg me

20:26.350 --> 20:28.602
to be the voice
of reason right here,

20:28.660 --> 20:31.220
but a man was gunned down
right in front of us,

20:31.270 --> 20:33.488
and you now want to go
outside the wire

20:33.530 --> 20:34.963
to go to another club?Yup.

20:35.010 --> 20:37.968
It's not happening.

20:38.010 --> 20:39.796
You're losing
your edge there, Sonny.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.183
I suggest you go into your cage.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.846
Call Stella. She'll keep you
from climbing the walls.

20:45.890 --> 20:48.541
All right? I'm gonna sit here
with an ice-cold beer.

20:48.590 --> 20:51.639
Disappointed, buddy.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.545
Yep.You have fun sitting on your
little ice-cold beer there.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.806
I will.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.779
Carla Reyes. Self-made,
built her own talent agency.

21:01.820 --> 21:03.811
No records, no criminal history.

21:03.870 --> 21:06.259
A pillar of the community
and very well-respected.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.860
Why do I have the feeling
you're about to take some of
the shine off that respect?

21:08.910 --> 21:10.468
That's for sure.

21:10.530 --> 21:15.046
Two of her clients-- models--
were found murdered last year.

21:15.090 --> 21:16.876
Tortured and hanged.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.785
So how does this connect
Doza to them?

21:18.840 --> 21:20.353
We believe Carla Reyes

21:20.400 --> 21:22.664
has been providing "models"

21:22.710 --> 21:25.361
to the upper level
of Doza's cartel.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.798
Hooking them?

21:26.850 --> 21:28.499
Yes.

21:28.540 --> 21:30.326
So, have the local PD bring in
Ms. Carla Reyes

21:30.370 --> 21:31.883
and make her squeal.

21:31.940 --> 21:34.374
Not that easy. High chance of
leaks with the Mexican police.

21:34.420 --> 21:36.320
MANDY: Doza would find
out we're working her

21:36.380 --> 21:37.597
and the lead
would go cold.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.505
We need names from Carla.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.199
So we got to bring her in

21:41.250 --> 21:42.467
without anybody knowing
we have her.

21:42.510 --> 21:45.331
Raid her house.

21:45.390 --> 21:47.517
She lives in an upscale
high-rise. Tons of security.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.868
Her office?

21:48.910 --> 21:51.959
RITA: Carla has hundreds
of people working for her.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.989
Cameras all over the place.

21:53.050 --> 21:53.994
How does she get to work?

21:54.050 --> 21:55.347
Drives herself.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.560
JASON: Drives herself?
There you go.

21:56.610 --> 21:58.396
V.I. Vehicle interdiction.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.486
It's a two-car job.

21:59.530 --> 22:01.612
Isolate her,
the lead car boxes her in.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.446
The follow car pulls alongside,
makes the snatch,

22:03.490 --> 22:04.878
we take her car with us.

22:04.930 --> 22:06.227
ISR?N0.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.929
A drone over the city
would just stand out.

22:07.970 --> 22:10.313
Let's just put a helo up.
Lot of choppers in the sky.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.450
No one's gonna even blink.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.797
I'm coming, too. I need to help.

22:12.850 --> 22:14.192
MARTINEZ:
No, no, no.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.413
You're out_ of the action.
You stay With your family.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.325
Colonel...

22:18.380 --> 22:20.245
I can't have your focus
in two different places

22:20.290 --> 22:21.541
at the same time.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.898
JASON: That's it.
That's the plan. Go back,

22:23.950 --> 22:25.110
do whatever it is
you need to do.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.206
Sonny, take care of business.

22:26.250 --> 22:28.423
Right? We'll meet back here
at 1500.

22:30.430 --> 22:32.250
See this right here?

22:32.300 --> 22:34.291
These boys,

22:34.350 --> 22:38.605
they play in a terrible land
called Alabama.

22:38.660 --> 22:41.049
It's full of bugs,
it's all swampy.

22:41.090 --> 22:42.398
They like to run
their mouths a lot,

22:42.440 --> 22:45.170
and they wear
these big old red shirts.

22:45.230 --> 22:49.348
Now, the thing is, they ain't
ever played against Vince Young.

22:49.410 --> 22:52.573
He's a-- he's like
a Greek god,

22:52.630 --> 22:54.279
and instead of throwing
lightning bolts,

22:54.320 --> 22:55.457
he throws a football.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.627
You with me?

22:57.680 --> 22:59.625
Now, he's a real American hero.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.454
You know they can't
understand you?

23:04.600 --> 23:07.023
Yes, they can.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.503
It's all mental.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.461
Give me the ball.
Here you are. See?

23:12.520 --> 23:17.423
Huh? Now, look, this right here,
this ain't no American football.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.641
But when in Mexico,

23:19.700 --> 23:23.431
carpe diem. Check this out.

23:23.480 --> 23:27.439
Goal!

23:27.490 --> 23:29.446
You like that?
That was good, right?

23:29.490 --> 23:33.017
Seems like the kids are
holding up pretty good.

23:33.060 --> 23:35.494
Tough like their dad.

23:37.450 --> 23:41.238
I'd rather they be happy
than tough.

23:41.280 --> 23:45.410
They should be in school,
not hiding behind walls.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.769
The worse part?

23:47.810 --> 23:49.209
Doza's after my family,

23:49.250 --> 23:51.423
and I can't even take up
the fight against him.

23:51.470 --> 23:55.509
Hey. We're taking up
the fight for you.

23:55.560 --> 24:00.213
A few years back, a soldier
I knew was marked for death.

24:00.260 --> 24:02.387
He went underground.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.954
When the cartel
couldn't find him,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.958
they slit his wife
and daughter's throats.

24:10.310 --> 24:14.610
They marked his mother, his
father, sister and her children.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.446
And the only way
he could save them,

24:17.490 --> 24:19.708
to stop Doza's men from
slaughtering everyone he knew

24:19.760 --> 24:23.969
and loved, was to give himself
up to the cartel.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.320
They hung him from a bridge

24:28.370 --> 24:32.898
across the street
from his sister's home.

24:32.940 --> 24:35.636
It's not a happy ending, Lopez.

24:35.690 --> 24:38.250
The rest of his family lived.

24:38.300 --> 24:42.509
His death secured their lives.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.425
Animals.

24:44.480 --> 24:47.608
No. Devils.

25:01.580 --> 25:03.707
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 6.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.102
Got eyes on Reyes' vehicle.

25:05.150 --> 25:06.754
She's about to come around
a corner.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.649
Got visual confirmation.
Target on the move.

25:43.750 --> 25:47.368
Bravo 3, you
in position?

25:51.940 --> 25:53.840
This is Bravo 3.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.674
We're in position
at the interdiction point.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.723
DAVIS: We're tracking
the target on ISR now.

26:00.770 --> 26:03.500
She's about to hit
the first roadblock.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.883
So far, so good.

27:00.400 --> 27:03.130
Should be another right.

27:03.180 --> 27:04.966
Two more turns,
and she'll be there.

27:05.010 --> 27:06.739
Bravo 1, be advised,

27:06.790 --> 27:08.746
target is still maintaining
a course towards

27:08.800 --> 27:10.006
the interdiction point.

27:10.060 --> 27:11.402
Check. Good copy, Havoc.

27:13.930 --> 27:15.841
Getting close to go time, boss.

27:15.890 --> 27:17.141
Bravo 3, stand by.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.363
HVT is heading your way.

27:21.420 --> 27:23.456
Bravo 3 is ready to dance.

27:23.510 --> 27:24.989
JASON:
Bravo 6, how's your view?

27:25.030 --> 27:27.669
No walkers or joggers
in the street.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.027
Nearest car
is three blocks behind.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.115
Our window's opening.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.855
HVT is one minute out.

27:32.910 --> 27:33.945
Only got one shot at this, boys.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.649
No pressure.

27:42.180 --> 27:44.876
Bravo 3, we're turning
the last corner.

27:47.750 --> 27:48.910
SONNY:
This is Bravo 3.

27:48.970 --> 27:50.779
I have eyes on target.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.668
All elements, on my mark.

28:01.150 --> 28:02.936
Hey, h-hold up, hold up.
We got a train coming.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.151
We got a train coming.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.326
You got to be kidding me.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.675
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

28:18.000 --> 28:18.944
The hell is she doing?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.298
JASON:
Havoc Base, this is 1.

28:21.350 --> 28:23.773
I've got a major problem. HVT is
veering off course. I say again,

28:23.830 --> 28:24.910
she is veering off course.

28:24.960 --> 28:25.858
ERIC:
Yeah, we're seeing it, Bravo 1.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.171
We're canked.

28:27.220 --> 28:29.916
Go ahead and RTB.
Window won't be there.

28:29.960 --> 28:30.961
Damn it.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.830
Negative. Find another window.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.962
Hey, we can do it another day.No! We're not waiting.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.534
We're doing this tonight.

28:36.580 --> 28:38.923
She goes down tonight.
Havoc, this is 1.

28:38.970 --> 28:40.187
We're not taking
a loss on this.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.571
We need a new place
to interdict.

28:51.420 --> 28:55.459
CLAY: Hey, Bravo 1, she's about
120 meters ahead of you.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.032
Up ahead. This vacant lot.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.388
There's not enough room.

29:03.430 --> 29:05.079
If they're a few meters
off, they're gonna be

29:05.130 --> 29:06.028
in full view of those
apartment towers.

29:06.090 --> 29:08.558
That's the only option I see.

29:08.610 --> 29:10.566
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

29:10.610 --> 29:13.135
There is a vacant lot 500 meters
ahead of you.

29:13.180 --> 29:15.648
If you can funnel her in there,
you'll have a chance.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.701
JASON: Copy that.
We'll take her there.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.140
Bravo 3, how copy?

29:22.670 --> 29:25.138
Havoc, this is Bravo 3.
I read you Lima Charlie.

29:25.190 --> 29:26.145
We're two minutes out.

29:28.630 --> 29:31.497
CLAY: All stations be advised,
I've got an MCPD cruiser

29:31.550 --> 29:33.324
patrolling towards
the new snatch point.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.938
There's a chance
that he makes us.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.288
Can't risk them seeing us.
We got to distract those cops.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.728
Sonny could handle
the distraction,

29:38.770 --> 29:40.590
but we need both the cars
for the V.I.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.459
We got Clay.

29:41.510 --> 29:42.818
Not while he's in the air.

29:42.860 --> 29:45.169
You know what?
So we call an audible.

29:45.210 --> 29:46.814
Right? We do a helo V.I.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.553
Helo V.I.

29:48.610 --> 29:50.089
Bravo 6,

29:50.130 --> 29:52.303
we maneuver Reyes into the lot,

29:52.350 --> 29:54.398
I want you and the pilot
to do a V.I.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.954
Yeah, affirmative, Bravo 1.
We can make that happen.

29:57.010 --> 29:59.137
The lot's coming up
in 400 meters.

29:59.180 --> 30:00.351
JASON:
Copy that. Bravo 3,

30:00.400 --> 30:02.868
once we engage,
distract the police unit.

30:02.930 --> 30:04.704
SONNY:
Roger that.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.308
Bravo 6, stand by.

30:10.930 --> 30:12.329
Initiate.

30:12.370 --> 30:14.713
Three, two, one.

31:08.380 --> 31:10.075
Go, go, go, go.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.519
Hola.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.949
Sorry, we're having
trouble with our rental

31:14.000 --> 31:15.865
that we have here--
it's kind of a piece of junk.

31:19.610 --> 31:21.658
JASON: Havoc, this is 1.
We're passing Rick James.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.487
Say again, we're passing
Rick James. We're RTB.

31:26.620 --> 31:29.839
Uh, el trucko,uh, explodo.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.484
Yeah, we're having,
we're having some, uh,

31:31.540 --> 31:34.179
some-some tr-- yeah, trouble.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.275
Yeah.

31:35.320 --> 31:38.323
Do you have-- you got a... oh.

31:38.370 --> 31:39.587
Should've got a Tesla.

32:11.400 --> 32:14.358
You don't have the right
to hold me here.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.401
I haven't done anything wrong.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.323
Who the hell are you?

32:21.370 --> 32:24.237
I'm whoever you want me to be.

32:24.290 --> 32:28.112
Your friend,
your enemy.

32:28.160 --> 32:31.630
Up to you.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.591
You work
with Andres Doza.

32:33.640 --> 32:34.857
No, I don't.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.982
Who is Dante Vega?

32:39.470 --> 32:42.257
You don't understand what's
happening here, do you, Carla?

32:42.300 --> 32:44.256
You've jumped into
the deep end of the pool.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.949
You're in big trouble.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.132
RITA:
Maria Cervantes,

32:54.180 --> 32:57.229
Josefina Perez.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.972
Your clients.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.328
Their deaths were tragic.

33:07.370 --> 33:09.588
Their deaths
were predictable.

33:09.630 --> 33:13.418
You whore a naive girl
out to a cartel boss.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.508
One night she's not gonna want
to do one thing or another,

33:15.550 --> 33:17.723
and she ends up hanging
from a bridge.

33:17.770 --> 33:19.556
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:23.430 --> 33:25.125
RITA:
Ellas.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.037
It's the kind of beautiful
most men cannot afford, yeah?

33:28.090 --> 33:31.787
Dante Vega worked for people
high up on the food chain

33:31.830 --> 33:33.172
in the Doza Cartel.

33:33.220 --> 33:36.519
I want the names
of those men.

33:38.580 --> 33:41.356
Talk or I talk.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.355
I tell the world Carla Reyes

33:43.410 --> 33:45.446
is cooperating
in the hunt for Doza.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.230
That would be a lie.Oh?

33:48.280 --> 33:49.588
They would kill me.

33:49.630 --> 33:51.416
Karma's a bitch.

33:52.550 --> 33:54.450
Who the hell are you?

33:54.510 --> 33:57.070
Right now, I'm your executioner.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.543
That's what _
you're making me into.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.989
Why not make me a friend?

34:05.690 --> 34:08.739
Yeah. You know what,
I'm not gonna lie, brother.Yeah?

34:08.780 --> 34:10.645
There was a moment
that I didn't think

34:10.700 --> 34:11.951
we were gonna pull it off.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.865
You know what? Maybe our luck's
about to change.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.559
So I'm-a ask you a question:
is it, is it unpatriotic of me

34:16.610 --> 34:19.738
to think that bad Mexican beer
is better than

34:19.790 --> 34:21.485
bad American beer?

34:21.530 --> 34:23.225
It's not unpatriotic
if it's true.

34:23.270 --> 34:24.794
Take those two,
I'll take these two.

34:24.840 --> 34:26.535
RAY: Two and two,
let's do it.

34:26.580 --> 34:28.571
Oh, yeah, that's beautiful.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.404
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh.

34:30.450 --> 34:31.587
Okay, okay, relax.

34:31.630 --> 34:32.938
He's gone.

34:32.980 --> 34:35.323
What about Juan

34:35.370 --> 34:40.501
Juan! He went to go give himself
over to Doza's men to save us.

34:47.780 --> 34:49.554
Hey! Hey!

34:49.600 --> 34:51.556
wig;

34:51.610 --> 34:54.568
Jason, this is crazy. We cannot
just roll into cartel territory.

34:54.610 --> 34:56.430
What are we gonna do, huh?
They kill him--

34:56.480 --> 34:59.267
I'm the one who made this mess.
I got to clean it up.

34:59.310 --> 35:01.824
Get in. Come on!

35:01.880 --> 35:03.040
Damn it.

35:19.110 --> 35:20.896
JASON:
Hey, hey, hey.

35:20.940 --> 35:22.635
No! I have to do this!Come on, hey.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.193
Listen to me. Get over here.
Get out of the street.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.467
Get in the car now.No.

35:25.510 --> 35:26.898
Get in the car. Shut up.No!

35:26.950 --> 35:28.338
My family's not safe.Get in the car. We're leaving.

35:28.380 --> 35:29.688
Get in the car, we're leaving.
Listen to me.

35:29.730 --> 35:31.425
You're gonna be killed.
You're gonna die.

35:31.470 --> 35:33.381
And this will hang over
your family for the rest
of your life.

35:33.430 --> 35:34.681
There's no rest of their lives

35:34.740 --> 35:36.469
if I don't do this.Looking at you, dead.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.078
Is that what you want

35:38.130 --> 35:40.178
Is that what you want?J, J, we got to go.
We got to go.

35:40.220 --> 35:42.085
We got to get out of here.
Lopez,

35:42.140 --> 35:43.346
get your ass in the car or
I'm gonna shoot you myself.Get in the car.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.913
Listen. You got my word:

35:44.960 --> 35:46.609
we're gonna get Doza, we're
gonna get your family back.

35:46.660 --> 35:48.218
But right now, we got to go.
We got to get in that car,

35:48.270 --> 35:49.441
we got to go.
Get in the car.

35:49.490 --> 35:51.708
Okay? Let's go.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.274
Get in the car.

36:11.690 --> 36:14.591
SONNY:
What do we got here?

36:14.650 --> 36:16.595
We're going to this place after.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.864
It's time to shine.It's time to shine.

36:19.910 --> 36:21.958
Let's go. I'm glad you finally
decided to come out.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.388
Oh, man. All right.This is good.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.829
Well, you were getting
so damn antsy,

36:25.870 --> 36:27.349
and you had that look
you were gonna go out anyway,

36:27.400 --> 36:30.267
and I am not one
to let anybody drink alone.

36:30.310 --> 36:31.652
That's awfully kind
of you, Sonny.Oh, yeah.

36:31.710 --> 36:32.870
Two tequila shots.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.831
Yeah, look at that.

36:34.880 --> 36:38.623
Come on, don't you think?
And yes.

36:38.670 --> 36:40.535
BARTENDER: Dos ms?

36:40.580 --> 36:42.798
Okay, buddy. Cheers, buddy.Send that down. Here we go.

36:44.590 --> 36:45.841
I'll meet you outside.
He's getting the drinks.

36:45.890 --> 36:46.891
All right.See you.

36:46.940 --> 36:48.100
I don't have
any more pesos left.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.673
See you. See you... See you.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.722
All right, two more, please.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.865
I am 100% gonna puke up that
bean burrito I ate earlier.

37:01.910 --> 37:03.866
'Cause this ground
is moving on me.

37:03.910 --> 37:04.990
Here you go.

37:05.040 --> 37:08.123
So, uh, you gonna
tell me what's up?

37:08.180 --> 37:11.081
What do you mean?
Nothing's up, man.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.438
That's a tall tale there, son.

37:13.490 --> 37:15.788
Come on. Something's off.

37:15.840 --> 37:19.310
Look at you. You're off.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.271
What, are we gonna sit here and
talk about our feelings, Sonny,

37:21.320 --> 37:23.368
or are we gonna drink?
What is this

37:23.410 --> 37:25.014
Just down the shot.You know, look,

37:25.060 --> 37:28.803
I-I just noticed that there are
precisely zero photos of Stella

37:28.850 --> 37:30.238
in our hooch anymore.

37:30.290 --> 37:33.157
You haven't Slqped
with her lately.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.668
And your face is droopier
than a Redtick Hound

37:35.730 --> 37:37.630
on pot brownies
since we got here.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.909
So what's going on?

37:40.950 --> 37:43.862
You know, you're actually
fairly perceptive for a little

37:43.910 --> 37:45.559
simpleminded Southern boy.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.995
Texas is not the South.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.382
And wagging your jaw like that

37:50.440 --> 37:51.828
pisses off Texans
and Southerners.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.918
I-I-- won't happen again.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.781
All right. So
what's going on?

37:59.710 --> 38:02.440
Stella and I, uh, we broke up.

38:02.490 --> 38:05.664
I'm sorry, man.

38:05.710 --> 38:07.792
Thousand lifetimes
I meet Stella,

38:07.850 --> 38:11.718
we work out in 999 of them.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.716
Not this one.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.581
It gets better.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.722
Piece of advice for you,
brother.

38:18.770 --> 38:19.930
Mm

38:19.990 --> 38:23.596
Don't ever fall in love.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.642
Roger that.

39:00.640 --> 39:03.200
Let's go get those beers
on the roof, okay?

39:03.250 --> 39:06.117
Ain't got to ask me twice.

39:07.690 --> 39:10.773
_ CLAY: You are the worst
Wingman-- I was about to close.

39:10.820 --> 39:11.991
She was very nice...

39:12.040 --> 39:13.735
Yeah.

39:13.780 --> 39:17.125
Listen, driftwood starts to look
that good after that many shots.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.909
Okay

39:18.960 --> 39:20.564
You're all turned-- what are
you doing? Come here. Let's go.

39:20.610 --> 39:22.953
On the couch. On the--
there you go.

39:23.010 --> 39:25.478
Oh, man.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.919
Here we go. Feet up, head down.

39:27.970 --> 39:32.532
There is no choking
on your puke, okay?

39:32.580 --> 39:34.969
All right?

39:35.020 --> 39:37.488
Nobody's burying you in Paris
like Morrison.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.758
You're a dick.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.846
Morrison O.D.ed,
you idiot.

39:44.770 --> 39:46.897
DAVIS:
Hey.

39:46.940 --> 39:47.986
Are you nuts?

39:50.640 --> 39:53.108
Well, hello there,
Miss Blind Side.

39:53.170 --> 39:55.730
Seriously? Come on, you're gonna
take him outside the wire

39:55.780 --> 39:57.293
to go drinking?

39:57.350 --> 40:00.126
Hey, look, a field trip wasn't
necessarily the best idea,

40:00.180 --> 40:01.909
but, boy, oh, boy,
did he need it.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.473
And I'll have you know,

40:03.530 --> 40:05.521
I did not do most
of the drinking.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.834
Oh, yeah. Give me
a break, Sonny.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.438
What? I wouldn't lie to friends.

40:10.970 --> 40:12.312
Wow.

40:12.360 --> 40:15.352
Okay, so what?
This is responsible Sonny?

40:15.410 --> 40:16.627
Yeah.

40:16.670 --> 40:17.921
That sounded wrong, doesn't it?

40:17.980 --> 40:19.663
Yeah.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.847
That's terrible. In that case,

40:21.890 --> 40:25.360
I'm gonna go get myself some
beer and drink the night away.

40:25.420 --> 40:27.934
You're welcome to join me.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.981
Oh, no, I'm-I'm gonna go to bed.

40:30.030 --> 40:32.851
All right. Good night, Davis.

40:32.900 --> 40:34.902
Good night.

40:38.430 --> 40:40.682
You know what

40:40.740 --> 40:41.866
I wouldn't be a good
teammate or friend

40:41.910 --> 40:43.218
if I didn't say something.

40:43.260 --> 40:44.818
What's that, Ray?
What do you want to say?

40:44.870 --> 40:46.087
You're doing the shark thing.

40:46.130 --> 40:47.472
You haven't stopped moving,

40:47.530 --> 40:49.998
avoiding all the stuff
that's going on inside you.

40:50.050 --> 40:51.654
Please, spare me the armchair
analysis, will you?

40:51.710 --> 40:54.133
You're looking after
everybody but yourself.

40:54.190 --> 40:57.318
You got Emma, Mikey,
Bravo, a

40:57.360 --> 40:59.499
No, look, I helped Lopez 'cause
it was the right thing to do.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.973
Okay? That's why I helped him.No. No.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.237
That's why I did it, Ray.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.497
No, it's not. No.No, it's not

41:03.540 --> 41:04.711
You did it because
you blame yourself

41:04.760 --> 41:07.411
for the position
he's in. You do.

41:07.460 --> 41:11.157
And it's not your fault, J.
It's just damn bad luck.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.026
Maybe.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.150
You're latching on.Latching onto what, Ray?

41:16.210 --> 41:18.508
Any problem that needs fixing.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.596
An injustice that needs
justice, a family that needs

41:20.650 --> 41:22.038
to be kept together because
yours was torn apart.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.604
Is that what you think?

41:23.650 --> 41:25.902
Yeah, that's what I think.That's what Ray Perry thinks.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.781
Well, I'll tell you what, Ray.
You want to know what I think?

41:28.830 --> 41:31.003
What?Here's what I think.

41:31.050 --> 41:33.006
I think you should
get off my back.

41:33.050 --> 41:36.395
That's what I think. Everybody
should just get off my back.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.099
I am fine.

41:38.140 --> 41:41.098
Got it? Real simple.

41:41.150 --> 41:44.142
I'm gonna have those beers,
if you're coming.

41:44.190 --> 41:46.454
You know what? The beers sound
like a good idea.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.536
I'm coming.
