anything like that.</i>

01:04.274 --> 01:05.525
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:05.734 --> 01:07.360
<i>Something tore him up.</i>

01:10.530 --> 01:11.948
<i>- Oh!
- Yeah.</i>

01:29.632 --> 01:31.009
What's your prognosis, John?

01:35.263 --> 01:36.514
Well, he's dead for sure.

Somebody's been
killed downtown

02:56.719 --> 02:58.096
they said it was Jeb Jolly.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.472
- The mechanic?
- Hmm.

02:59.681 --> 03:01.349
<i>That's terrible.</i>

03:01.558 --> 03:03.434
I mean, you guys are
the ones that are worried

03:03.643 --> 03:05.478
about going out of business.

03:07.397 --> 03:10.275
That's two bodies in a week,
that's money in the bank.

03:10.483 --> 03:12.569
Don't even joke
like that, John.

03:12.777 --> 03:14.779
<i>You okay here?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

03:18.908 --> 03:21.578
- It stinks really bad.
<i>- She.</i>

03:21.786 --> 03:23.288
She stinks really bad.

03:23.496 --> 03:25.957
She does smell for a woman.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.542
Wish someone
had found her sooner.

03:27.750 --> 03:28.835
Leg.

03:30.295 --> 03:31.504
Turn your head.

03:32.338 --> 03:36.176
Oh, Ron's getting lazier.
He didn't even clean her.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.179
He just declared natural causes
and shipped her over.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.388
Other leg.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.947
<i>Aneurysm hooks.</i>

04:03.494 --> 04:04.829
How's school?

04:05.038 --> 04:07.123
<i>I mean, you know,
Aunt Margaret it's</i>

04:07.332 --> 04:08.791
<i>it's the first week,
nothing much really happens.</i>

04:20.595 --> 04:23.264
- Make any new friends?
<i>- It's funny, actually.</i>

04:23.473 --> 04:25.391
All those kids
that I've gone to school with

04:25.600 --> 04:27.310
since kindergarten...

04:27.518 --> 04:31.022
<i>...they all left,
so...they're all new kids</i>

04:31.231 --> 04:32.857
and they all wanted
to be friends with me.

04:35.652 --> 04:37.946
And it was pretty sweet.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.995
Who are you?

05:29.622 --> 05:30.790
My name is John.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.882
<i>And welcome back

<i>The death of a Clayton man,
Jeb Jolly, aged 53</i>

05:49.100 --> 05:51.394
<i>is now under

05:51.602 --> 05:53.396
<i>The local mechanic's body
was found yesterday</i>

05:53.604 --> 05:55.148
<i>by one woman who likened
the violent scene</i>

05:55.356 --> 05:58.234
<i>to, quote,
"A bizarre animal attack."</i>

05:58.443 --> 05:59.569
<i>Clayton County
Police Department</i>

<i>Jolly's family

06:27.930 --> 06:30.475
Hey, Principal Layton
wants to see you.

06:43.738 --> 06:45.365
<i>Mrs. Cleaver,
take a seat please.</i>

06:53.456 --> 06:56.167
<i>John, adolescence
can be a difficult time.</i>

06:57.293 --> 06:59.504
It's normal to be
interested in the world

06:59.712 --> 07:01.381
and all of its problems.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.967
<i>Normal to be drawn
to death and murder.</i>

07:05.176 --> 07:08.679
<i>But, unfortunately, you can go
too far down that road.</i>

07:08.888 --> 07:11.140
Too far away from...

07:11.349 --> 07:13.935
Well, normal thoughts.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.065
What do you say, John?

07:24.112 --> 07:25.988
I'm interested in
how many times you felt

07:26.197 --> 07:28.157
it was necessary
to say the word "normal."

07:31.160 --> 07:32.703
<i>It's not like there's a whole
lot to say about Einstein.</i>

07:32.912 --> 07:34.956
I mean, he discovered
E equals MC square

07:35.164 --> 07:37.041
and nuclear bombs but that's it.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.377
I'm lucky I got
half a page at all.

07:39.585 --> 07:40.920
And you missed
two points for length

07:41.129 --> 07:43.297
you missed another two
for spelling.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.382
I mean, you managed
to spell Einstein

07:44.590 --> 07:45.466
a different way every time.

07:45.675 --> 07:46.968
That's creativity.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.387
No, that's remarkable.
That's amazing.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.058
Hoo! Say, you guys, uh

07:54.267 --> 07:56.227
<i>you guys catch that smell?</i>

07:56.436 --> 07:58.187
Smells of something dead.

07:58.396 --> 08:00.064
Something rotting.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.161
Freak.

08:19.834 --> 08:22.170
So, what psycho
did you write about?

08:22.378 --> 08:25.047
Dennis Rader, uh, the,
uh, the BTK Killer.

08:27.175 --> 08:28.468
That's how he signed all of his
letters to the media

08:28.676 --> 08:30.970
as "Bind, torture, kill."

08:31.179 --> 08:32.889
How many people did he kill?

08:33.097 --> 08:36.058
Maybe 10, they're not, they're
not sure but could be more.

08:36.267 --> 08:37.184
<i>Only 10?</i>

08:37.393 --> 08:38.727
<i>The guy you wrote
about last year</i>

08:38.936 --> 08:40.313
was way better at it.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.563
<i>Jeffrey Dahmer.</i>

08:41.772 --> 08:42.648
He was a cannibal and he kept

08:42.857 --> 08:44.901
severed heads in his freezer.

08:45.109 --> 08:46.319
<i>I remember your pictures now.</i>

08:46.527 --> 08:48.154
They gave me nightmares.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.280
Nightmares are nothin' man.

08:49.489 --> 08:51.157
Those pictures gave me
a therapist.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.934
Oh, what up?

09:18.142 --> 09:19.560
<i>That black cloud
above ya's growing.</i>

09:20.853 --> 09:23.606
I broke one of my rules.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.733
- Stalking anybody?
- No.

09:25.942 --> 09:28.027
What else?

09:28.236 --> 09:30.947
Have you heard about
the Macdonald triad?

09:31.155 --> 09:34.200
Three traits shared by 95
percent of all serial killers

09:34.408 --> 09:36.953
bedwetting, pyromania,
animal cruelty.

09:37.161 --> 09:39.330
<i>You do, I admit,
have all three.</i>

09:40.998 --> 09:43.834
What really gets me is...

09:44.001 --> 09:46.170
...you know, a -- animal cruelty
predicts violent behavior...

09:47.880 --> 09:49.298
...but until I read that
I -- I didn't think

09:49.507 --> 09:51.884
it was wrong...you know.

09:52.093 --> 09:53.678
What else?

09:56.222 --> 09:57.390
Well, if I -- I -- I...

09:57.598 --> 10:00.434
If I'm thinking about
hurting a person, then...

10:00.643 --> 10:03.312
...you know, I'll just
give them a compliment.

10:03.521 --> 10:06.607
If somebody's really bugging me
to the point where...

10:06.816 --> 10:08.985
...when I think about
killing them, then...

10:09.193 --> 10:10.111
...I'll just, I'll just smile

10:10.319 --> 10:12.196
and I'll say
something nice...you know?

10:16.409 --> 10:18.119
- Is that hot chocolate?
- Uh-huh.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.329
I'm good.

10:20.538 --> 10:23.708
John, you have
a -- a lot of predictors

10:23.916 --> 10:26.502
for serial killer behavior,
but

10:26.711 --> 10:28.379
<i>predictors are just that,
they predict</i>

10:28.588 --> 10:30.798
<i>what might happen,
not what will happen.</i>

10:31.007 --> 10:33.426
<i>You're in control
of your own destiny.</i>

10:33.634 --> 10:35.928
<i>You're a good person, John.
That's important.</i>

10:46.439 --> 10:47.398
Hey, John?

10:47.607 --> 10:49.233
- Yeah, Mr. Crowley?
- Come here.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.362
What do you know
about smartphones?

10:53.571 --> 10:54.989
Uh, I don't know.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.199
What do you, what do you need?

10:57.408 --> 10:59.577
I want to send
my wife a kiss.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.078
You want to send her a kiss?

11:01.287 --> 11:02.705
<i>You're supposed to be able
to take photos</i>

11:02.913 --> 11:04.290
<i>and send them to each other.</i>

11:04.498 --> 11:06.459
- Alright, um...
<i>- Show me how it's done.</i>

11:06.667 --> 11:09.170
- Well, so, it's that button.
- Uh-huh.

11:09.378 --> 11:10.963
And then...

11:11.172 --> 11:12.298
...you can use this one
to take the picture, so...

11:12.506 --> 11:14.175
- Oh, oh...
- Here you go.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.806
Okay.

11:21.015 --> 11:21.891
And there you go.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.353
Good Lord,
she's gonna be in shock

11:25.561 --> 11:26.479
that's for sure.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.971
Brooke?
Come on down, dinner's ready.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.810
Relax, he's dead.
He's going nowhere fast.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.063
Is that Jeb Jolly?

12:51.272 --> 12:53.315
Oh-ho, yes.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.986
<i>Hey...</i>

12:57.194 --> 12:59.613
<i>...you surviving?</i>

12:59.822 --> 13:01.157
Uh...

13:01.365 --> 13:02.825
Are you?

13:03.033 --> 13:05.161
<i>I'm not the one
who has to live with mom.</i>

13:05.369 --> 13:07.329
<i>You hear from dad?</i>

13:07.538 --> 13:08.497
No.

13:08.706 --> 13:09.832
You?

13:10.040 --> 13:11.333
Rarely.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.252
I ask him for money sometimes.

13:14.170 --> 13:16.338
- John?
- Yeah?

13:16.547 --> 13:18.674
- Dr. Neblin told me.
- What?

13:18.883 --> 13:21.302
That you think you're going
to kill somebody.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.514
That's funny,
'cause that's not what I said.

13:25.723 --> 13:28.434
What I said was that,
I follow very strict rules

13:28.642 --> 13:30.770
to keep me from doing
anything wrong.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.938
Seems like
you'd be happy about that.

13:33.147 --> 13:34.398
Happy...

13:34.607 --> 13:36.442
...is not a son
who has to follow rules

13:36.650 --> 13:38.194
to keep himself from
killing people

13:38.402 --> 13:40.446
happy is not a psychologist

13:40.654 --> 13:43.240
telling me my son
is a sociopath.

13:43.449 --> 13:46.243
He actually said that?
That's kinda cool.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.037
Antisocial--

13:48.245 --> 13:49.038
Hate to dump this on you

13:49.246 --> 13:50.664
this time of night, April.

13:50.873 --> 13:51.874
It's a hell of a thing.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.127
I think the damage
is done, mom.

13:55.336 --> 13:57.505
What dive
are you heading to tonight?

13:57.713 --> 13:59.298
Somewhere with more
living people then here

13:59.507 --> 14:01.467
that's for sure. Have fun.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.203
<i>Oh, for the love of Mike.</i>

14:29.411 --> 14:31.413
<i>- I call organs.
- Fine.</i>

14:45.010 --> 14:46.679
<i>- Dang it, Ron.
- What?</i>

14:46.887 --> 14:49.306
Well, we're missing a kidney.

14:49.515 --> 14:50.724
<i>I've gone through
the bag twice.</i>

14:50.933 --> 14:52.601
You think Ron would manage
to send us all the organs

14:52.810 --> 14:54.144
for crying out loud.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.606
Well...

14:57.815 --> 14:59.483
What if the person
who killed him took it?

14:59.692 --> 15:01.026
- That's...
<i>- It's totally possible.</i>

15:01.235 --> 15:02.111
<i>Look at that.</i>

15:02.778 --> 15:03.904
<i>It'll be on the forms.</i>

15:04.113 --> 15:06.031
<i>I don't think so.
Oh, wait, here.</i>

15:06.240 --> 15:08.576
"Left kidney removed
via incisions to

15:08.784 --> 15:11.161
renal artery, veins and ureter."

15:11.370 --> 15:12.913
So he had it removed?

15:13.122 --> 15:16.625
No, there's no record
of that, it's just not there.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.635
<i>This is Ted Rath,
live at the scene</i>

15:26.844 --> 15:28.721
<i>where the ambulance has
just left and as you can see</i>

15:28.929 --> 15:31.432
<i>the police and a crowd
are gathering here in Clayton</i>

15:31.640 --> 15:33.350
<i>a normally peaceful town,
where a killer has struck</i>

15:33.559 --> 15:35.561
<i>possibly for the second time</i>

15:35.769 --> 15:38.606
<i>leaving a dead body and
a terrified town in his wake.</i>

15:38.814 --> 15:41.358
Stupid, stupid,
the last thing this town needs

15:41.567 --> 15:44.403
is panic about a mass murderer.

15:44.612 --> 15:46.780
I think the last thing
we need are the killings.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.532
<i>Now details are sketchy
at this time</i>

15:48.741 --> 15:50.993
<i>but what I have been able to
ascertain is there was a small</i>

15:51.201 --> 15:53.454
<i>pool of oil
or some black sludge found</i>

15:53.662 --> 15:55.623
<i>near the body of local farmer,
Dave Byrd.</i>

15:55.831 --> 15:56.916
<i>We will, of course,
be giving you details</i>

15:57.124 --> 15:58.083
<i>as they become available.</i>

15:58.292 --> 16:00.336
<i>This is a 5 Live
news exclusive.</i>

16:00.544 --> 16:02.922
<i>Death stalks
America's heartland.</i>

16:04.965 --> 16:07.676
Okay, so the first question
of psychological profiling is

16:07.885 --> 16:09.511
what's the killer doing
he doesn't absolutely

16:09.720 --> 16:11.221
have to be doing?

16:11.430 --> 16:13.390
Dude, I think
it's a werewolf.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.601
It's not a werewolf.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.478
Dude, did you see the news?

16:17.686 --> 16:20.439
It has the intelligence of man
with the furiocity of a beast.

16:20.648 --> 16:21.857
- What is that supposed to be?
- It's not a werewolf.

16:22.066 --> 16:23.484
Werewolves aren't real.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.319
The stories of them
probably started

16:25.527 --> 16:27.029
from serial killers, you know.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.240
Vampires too. It's just men
who hunt and kill other men.

16:30.449 --> 16:33.869
So assuming a basic goal
of trying to kill somebody.

16:34.078 --> 16:35.621
All you really need to do
is shoot them, right?

16:35.829 --> 16:36.789
Yeah.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.832
So what's he doing
that he doesn't have to do?

16:39.041 --> 16:41.669
Well, he's s -- stabbing him,
rippin' into him.

16:41.877 --> 16:42.628
Exactly, yeah, that's the,

16:42.836 --> 16:43.754
that's the first thing,
you know.

16:43.963 --> 16:45.756
He approaches 'em in person.

16:45.965 --> 16:47.800
Probably means he wants to be
close to the victims. What else?

16:48.008 --> 16:50.886
He attacked during the night,
in the dark.

16:51.095 --> 16:53.681
I think that's probably
just something he had to do.

16:53.889 --> 16:56.600
Doesn't that count
for your list?

16:56.809 --> 16:59.061
I mean, it's,
it's not a unique trait.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.689
Nobody who kills somebody else
wants to be seen.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.148
Just put it on your list,
I mean...

17:04.358 --> 17:06.234
...not everything in this
has to be your idea.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.498
Ted Bundy...

17:19.707 --> 17:20.874
...the one that they, uh...

17:21.125 --> 17:23.002
...they coined
the term serial killer for.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.716
He said that
after you killed somebody...

17:28.924 --> 17:31.176
You know, if you had
enough time with them,

17:31.385 --> 17:33.387
they could be whoever
you wanted them to be.

17:34.722 --> 17:37.891
<i>You're weird man.</i>

17:48.694 --> 17:50.904
I hate Halloween.
It's absurd, you know.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.948
This is the,
this is the night when

17:53.157 --> 17:55.492
evil spirits are supposed
to walk the Earth.

17:55.701 --> 17:59.163
You know, druids burning kids
in wicker baskets, you know.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.040
My position is vulnerable
out here, boys

18:01.248 --> 18:03.250
<i>let's stay alert
and keep moving.</i>

18:03.459 --> 18:04.835
Can't you just tell him
to go away?

18:05.044 --> 18:06.628
Nah, leave him alone.

18:06.837 --> 18:09.465
He's convinced the killer
is gonna come out and get us.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.717
Plus, it makes him happy.
Right, dad?

18:11.925 --> 18:13.969
<i>Let's just hurry up
and get the hell outta here.</i>

18:14.178 --> 18:16.847
<i>Dad, you said we could
stay out till 9:30.</i>

18:35.908 --> 18:38.786
<i>Trick or treat?</i>

18:38.994 --> 18:41.914
You boy's shouldn't be
out this late.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.875
Yeah. It's not safe
with a killer out there.

18:45.084 --> 18:46.585
That's what I'm saying.

18:46.794 --> 18:48.378
You boys be careful.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.711
Are you It?

19:29.920 --> 19:31.922
Am I what?

19:32.131 --> 19:35.008
The clown from "It,"
that Stephen King book.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.345
No.

19:38.554 --> 19:40.139
I was thinking about
dressing up as my mother

19:40.347 --> 19:43.392
but I was worried
what my therapist would say.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.018
You gonna juggle
for us, freak?

19:50.899 --> 19:52.401
That's a really
clever costume.

19:52.609 --> 19:53.861
<i>You know, it looks great.</i>

19:54.069 --> 19:55.529
It's really inventive and the

19:55.737 --> 19:57.698
the bullet hole looks...
really authentic.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.369
You know this is a party
for normal people? Right?

20:02.578 --> 20:03.912
So why don't you go home

20:04.121 --> 20:06.290
to your undertaking
slut of a mother.

20:06.498 --> 20:07.916
Alright?

20:09.793 --> 20:11.962
What are you smiling about?

20:12.171 --> 20:15.465
I've been clinically
diagnosed with sociopathy, Rob.

20:15.674 --> 20:16.842
To me, you're an object.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.927
You know, you're a,
you're a thing.

20:19.136 --> 20:21.597
You're about as important to me
as a cardboard box.

20:21.805 --> 20:24.808
And the -- the thing about
cardboard boxes...

20:25.017 --> 20:26.268
..is that...

20:26.476 --> 20:28.604
You know they're totally boring
on the outside, right?

20:28.812 --> 20:31.982
But...sometimes,
if you cut 'em open

20:32.191 --> 20:35.027
there'll be something
interesting inside.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.528
You know, and so,
while you're saying

20:36.737 --> 20:38.697
all these boring things to me

20:38.906 --> 20:40.449
I'm thinking about
what it'd be like

20:40.657 --> 20:42.159
to cut you open.

20:44.369 --> 20:47.873
But I -- I don't wanna,
I don't wanna be that person.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.833
And so, I have a rule

20:50.042 --> 20:52.628
that anytime somebody
says something to me

20:52.836 --> 20:55.464
where I -- I think about,
you know, cuttin' 'em.

20:57.216 --> 21:00.093
I -- I -- I just smile
and I say something nice.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.054
So that's why
I say to you,

21:02.262 --> 21:05.515
Rob Anders of 232
Carnation Street.

21:06.642 --> 21:08.936
You are a
really great guy.

21:13.649 --> 21:14.816
You're a freak.

21:26.495 --> 21:27.412
You're not a freak.

22:21.800 --> 22:22.968
<i>John.</i>

22:27.639 --> 22:29.308
What is this?

22:32.436 --> 22:33.729
It's...

22:35.314 --> 22:36.773
John...

22:36.982 --> 22:39.026
...wash up and get out.

22:39.234 --> 22:39.818
Mom, it's -- it's not...

22:40.027 --> 22:41.820
I should be stronger
with you. This is my fault.

22:42.029 --> 22:42.988
Mom, there -- there should be
something missing.

22:43.739 --> 22:45.574
There should be an organ
missing to fit the profile.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.754
Go!

23:04.760 --> 23:06.928
This door will be locked
in future!

23:11.767 --> 23:12.768
<i>Who told you?</i>

23:13.560 --> 23:16.021
He told a school counselor,
who told me.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.024
Lucky for you, she didn't tell
Principal Layton.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.527
<i>Apparently you gave him
nightmares, John.</i>

23:24.029 --> 23:25.364
Rob Anders is a bully.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.199
<i>Doesn't mean you can threaten
to kill him.</i>

23:27.407 --> 23:28.575
I, I didn't.

23:28.784 --> 23:31.495
And then there's
what happened in the mortuary.

23:31.703 --> 23:32.829
What is it?

23:33.038 --> 23:34.748
<i>What set you off?</i>

23:37.000 --> 23:38.585
It all just feels so close.

23:39.836 --> 23:41.963
<i>This is, this is nowhere.</i>

23:42.672 --> 23:44.091
It isn't supposed
to happen here,

23:44.299 --> 23:46.093
it's supposed to be
somewhere else, you know?

23:48.887 --> 23:51.390
Okay. Let me ask you this.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.767
<i>Who were you talking to just
before Rob Anders upset you?</i>

23:53.975 --> 23:56.770
Oh, it was just some girl.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.897
<i>She have a name?</i>

23:59.398 --> 24:01.191
<i>Her, her name is Brooke.</i>

24:01.400 --> 24:02.442
Cute?

24:03.902 --> 24:05.987
Little young for you, doctor.

24:08.281 --> 24:11.701
Yes. Barrow's goldeneye.
Come here.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.036
Have a look at this.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.249
Here.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.043
Straight over there.
Have a look.

24:22.754 --> 24:23.547
<i>Do you see it?</i>

24:23.755 --> 24:24.798
Oh...

24:26.550 --> 24:28.718
Yeah. A duck.

24:28.927 --> 24:30.887
That's a very rare duck.

24:31.096 --> 24:32.305
<i>So don't go killin' it.</i>

24:33.890 --> 24:36.268
<i>I haven't seen one of them
in over 5 years.</i>

24:37.310 --> 24:39.354
<i>Actually you can see the eyes,
that they're beautiful,</i>

24:39.563 --> 24:40.188
<i>they're beautiful.</i>

24:40.397 --> 24:42.399
<i>more amber, really, than gold.</i>

24:42.607 --> 24:45.610
<i>It catches the light, no matter
where they are. Exceptional.</i>

25:53.637 --> 25:55.096
<i>- Hey, you fishing?</i>
- Huh?

25:55.305 --> 25:57.557
<i>Are you goin' fishing?</i>

25:57.766 --> 25:58.975
Ice fishing.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.269
<i>Do you need a hand
with that stuff here?</i>

26:01.478 --> 26:04.856
<i>Let me just... take that
off your hands.</i>

26:05.065 --> 26:07.275
<i>Yeah, I used to go fishing
all the time up north.</i>

26:07.484 --> 26:08.109
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

26:08.318 --> 26:09.444
<i>Yeah, my uncle has a cabin...</i>

26:09.653 --> 26:11.071
- Oh, good.
- Oh, yeah.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.698
Yeah, you mind if I come along?

26:13.907 --> 26:15.242
Uh, well...

26:18.703 --> 26:21.331
How far off you going?

26:21.540 --> 26:24.543
Well, far enough.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.294
<i>You're gonna need a -- a hat
out there alright?</i>

27:10.547 --> 27:11.715
Uh...

28:10.398 --> 28:12.651
...I bought you a hat.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.302
Here.

29:29.644 --> 29:31.688
<i>We're not gonna tell your mom
about this, okay?</i>

29:31.896 --> 29:34.357
Right now she is simultaneously
trying to stuff a turkey

29:34.566 --> 29:36.109
and wipe away tears.

29:36.317 --> 29:37.610
She's crying?

29:37.819 --> 29:39.529
Uh-huh.

29:39.738 --> 29:41.489
Mother of all blow ups
yesterday with Lauren

29:41.698 --> 29:45.201
who's now not coming
to Thanksgiving dinner tonight.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.412
That leaves you and me, sport.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.997
<i>Go and wash.</i>

29:49.205 --> 29:52.292
I need you to come out of your
head for a couple hours, okay?

29:52.500 --> 29:53.877
Give her a hand...

29:54.085 --> 29:56.337
...make her realize she still
has one loving child left.

29:57.172 --> 29:58.381
Or at least pretend.

30:09.517 --> 30:11.311
Urgh!

30:16.191 --> 30:19.569
Oh, I had to stop by Ron's
for that file he forgot

30:19.778 --> 30:21.905
and he, uh, he told me a joke.

30:22.113 --> 30:23.948
- You wanna hear it?
- Sure.

30:24.157 --> 30:26.618
<i>What's small and grey
and screws in the walls?</i>

30:26.785 --> 30:28.787
I don't know...

30:39.964 --> 30:42.050
<i>John, can you...</i>

30:42.258 --> 30:44.260
<i>scoot across
to the Watsons and...</i>

30:44.469 --> 30:45.845
<i>ask Bev for some vanilla?</i>

30:47.138 --> 30:48.431
Uh...

30:48.640 --> 30:50.517
Yeah, sure.

31:02.403 --> 31:03.905
<i>Keep it up you loser.</i>

31:04.113 --> 31:05.448
<i>Hi, John.</i>

31:06.991 --> 31:09.160
- Uh, vanilla.
- Vanilla?

31:09.369 --> 31:10.995
Uh, yeah, vanilla.

31:11.204 --> 31:12.747
Vanilla, like, ice cream?

31:12.956 --> 31:15.542
Um, you know,
I'm not, I'm not really sure.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.585
Mom just said we needed some.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.128
Here you go, John.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.257
It's for cooking.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.556
<i>This is Ted Rath
with an update</i>

31:29.764 --> 31:31.391
<i>on the Clayton
killer situation.</i>

31:31.599 --> 31:32.892
<i>Now this reporter
has discovered there is</i>

31:33.101 --> 31:34.602
<i>an Emmet T. Openshaw</i>

31:34.811 --> 31:36.855
<i>an Arizona man who disappeared
from his home</i>

31:37.063 --> 31:38.940
<i>42 years ago.</i>

31:39.148 --> 31:40.066
<i>He was 30 at the time.</i>

31:40.275 --> 31:41.526
<i>Police found signs
of struggle</i>

31:41.734 --> 31:44.028
<i>but there was no body
found at the scene.</i>

31:44.237 --> 31:45.363
<i>Now the reason
this crime connects</i>

31:45.572 --> 31:46.656
<i>to what's happening here
in Clayton county</i>

31:46.865 --> 31:48.700
<i>is they found a similar pile</i>

31:48.908 --> 31:51.035
<i>of black oil
at the crime scene.</i>

32:17.937 --> 32:19.480
<i>Good morning, Mrs. Crowley,
um, I thought</i>

32:19.689 --> 32:21.441
I could shovel
your steps for you.

32:24.235 --> 32:25.904
Good morning, Kay.

32:26.112 --> 32:28.323
It snowed, so...

32:28.531 --> 32:30.366
I could shovel your drive
if you like, uh...

32:34.162 --> 32:36.372
Good morning, Mrs. Crowley.

32:36.581 --> 32:37.957
Good morning, Mrs. Crowley.

32:57.602 --> 32:58.937
John?

33:01.189 --> 33:03.191
Um...

33:03.399 --> 33:05.109
Hi, uh, the snow.

33:05.276 --> 33:07.236
I thought I'd...

33:07.445 --> 33:09.739
Well, that would be
very nice. Thank you.

33:09.948 --> 33:11.824
Sure thing.

33:40.561 --> 33:42.480
<i>Ah, it's a beautiful
day, John.</i>

33:44.649 --> 33:46.109
Makes you glad to be alive.

33:54.826 --> 33:57.120
Here you go, John.
Hot chocolate, your favorite.

33:58.454 --> 33:59.872
Thank you.

34:01.165 --> 34:02.959
<i>Every single time.</i>

34:07.463 --> 34:09.257
<i>Where are they?</i>

34:09.465 --> 34:11.342
Your forehead, dear.

34:45.376 --> 34:46.918
Takes the lungs...

34:49.797 --> 34:51.466
...takes the kidney...

34:54.469 --> 34:56.054
...took an arm.

35:03.478 --> 35:04.771
What next?

35:54.403 --> 35:57.115
- Uh...
- Okay.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.407
Yeah.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.932
<i>Repeating
tonight's top story</i>

36:23.141 --> 36:26.102
<i>the FBI has confirmed

36:42.618 --> 36:44.203
Oh, yeah.

36:44.412 --> 36:46.747
<i>Oh, by the way she had
to go powder her nose.</i>

36:46.956 --> 36:48.749
Oh, hey, I hope you don't mind
if I, uh

36:48.958 --> 36:49.750
take her for another spin.

36:49.959 --> 36:51.252
Oh, no, no, no.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.629
- I got some energy left.
- Good.

36:55.006 --> 36:56.757
Well, here's to ya.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.845
Oop, there's Kay.

37:01.053 --> 37:02.805
You don't mind, huh?
Take care now.

37:11.522 --> 37:13.441
Uh...

37:14.192 --> 37:15.526
Ah!

37:58.444 --> 37:59.695

Eat you own plate.

38:12.124 --> 38:12.917
<i>John?</i>

38:23.552 --> 38:25.429
I can't believe
you followed me.

38:25.638 --> 38:27.014
I can't believe you were
having dinner with my therapist.

38:27.223 --> 38:28.933
Don't be silly, John.

38:29.141 --> 38:32.061
Grant and I meet sometimes
to discuss your progress,

38:32.270 --> 38:34.522
a progress I am failing
to appreciate right now.

38:34.730 --> 38:36.524
Did I interrupt a date?

38:36.732 --> 38:38.234
Is that even ethical?

38:38.442 --> 38:40.194
It's, it's just
the first right up ahead.

38:40.403 --> 38:41.779
Thanks, April.

38:41.988 --> 38:43.030
Actually John's doing okay.

38:43.239 --> 38:44.782
- He is?
- I am?

38:44.991 --> 38:47.034
Sure, tonight, for example, you
were concerned for your mother

38:47.243 --> 38:49.245
with a killer in town.

38:49.453 --> 38:50.830
<i>You really believe
that I followed mom</i>

38:51.038 --> 38:52.540
because I was worried for her?

38:52.748 --> 38:54.292
You may be lacking
in empathy, John,

38:54.500 --> 38:56.752
but you should recognize a life
line when it's thrown at you.

39:14.854 --> 39:16.397
Hi, John.

39:18.983 --> 39:20.484
Hi, John!

39:23.946 --> 39:25.448
Hey.

39:26.324 --> 39:27.283
Extra work?

39:27.491 --> 39:29.410
Oh, it's,
just a project.

39:32.121 --> 39:34.790
Serial killers...fairies...

39:36.083 --> 39:39.628
...witchcraft...folktales.

39:40.796 --> 39:42.131
That's an
interesting combination.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.427
Need any help?

39:46.635 --> 39:48.888
No, I'm, I'm fine.

39:50.681 --> 39:52.308
Okay.

40:12.328 --> 40:14.789
<i>Pretty good job,
if I do say so myself.</i>

40:16.540 --> 40:18.751
<i>Hey, Tommy, you look
downright dangerous.</i>

40:18.959 --> 40:21.003
- Thanks. Good night, Greg.
<i>- Alright.</i>

40:23.130 --> 40:24.882
<i>Okay, Bill.
You're up next.</i>

40:25.091 --> 40:26.550
<i>Let's go.</i>

40:29.470 --> 40:31.472
Oh, boy.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.599
Too much dancing
the other night, huh?

40:36.060 --> 40:38.979
Yeah, well,
we'll...get you looking

40:39.188 --> 40:40.940
real good for the next time
out, okay?

40:43.275 --> 40:44.360
You need a crane there?

40:48.155 --> 40:49.824
So... Boy, it's been
a while, hasn't it?

40:50.032 --> 40:51.700
You -- you -- you want
something fancy today?

40:51.909 --> 40:53.452
Let's do the...
usual.

40:53.661 --> 40:55.704
The usual?
Alright. Hang tight.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.873
These things have to be
done delicately.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.167
Oh, Jesus.

41:01.377 --> 41:03.087
Uh, hang on a second,
I'll -- I'll get a...

41:03.295 --> 41:04.338
I gotta get another
scissors here.

41:04.547 --> 41:06.132
I'll be right back, alright?

41:06.340 --> 41:07.716
Won't be a moment.

41:53.220 --> 41:54.221
Fuck.

42:19.747 --> 42:21.749
<i>Police department.</i>

42:33.928 --> 42:35.387
Well, I guess we better
take a look around.

42:35.596 --> 42:37.765
Oh, no, uh...

42:37.973 --> 42:39.683
They didn't come through here.

42:39.892 --> 42:41.352
<i>Tom, check this out.</i>

42:41.560 --> 42:43.103
<i>There's something in here.</i>

43:43.998 --> 43:44.832
Uh...

43:47.084 --> 43:48.502
<i>Yes, my dear.</i>

43:49.878 --> 43:51.130
<i>Flour?</i>

43:52.798 --> 43:55.634
Uh, whole...
Whole grain?

43:55.843 --> 43:56.885
Oh, good.

43:58.679 --> 44:00.931
Yes, I'll, uh...

44:01.140 --> 44:02.725
I love you too.

44:52.024 --> 44:54.109
<i>This is Ted Rath coming to
you live from Clayton county</i>

44:54.318 --> 44:56.695
<i>where as you can see
tempers are flaring dangerously.</i>

44:56.904 --> 44:58.989
<i>We are at the home
of local barber Greg Olson.</i>

44:59.198 --> 45:00.783
<i>Olson is the owner
of the premises</i>

45:00.991 --> 45:02.910
<i>where the two policemen were
found dead earlier this week</i>

45:03.118 --> 45:04.453
<i>sparking this outrage.</i>

45:04.662 --> 45:05.496
<i>Let's see if we can get a word
from one of these</i>

45:05.704 --> 45:08.248
<i>concerned citizens.
Excuse me, sir, sir, sir!</i>

45:08.457 --> 45:09.583
<i>What to do you hope
to accomplish with this?</i>

45:09.792 --> 45:12.586
<i>Uh, well, as you can see,
people are angry</i>

45:12.795 --> 45:14.922
<i>and -- and -- and things
are getting out of hand.</i>

45:15.130 --> 45:16.173
<i>What is your name, sir?</i>

45:16.382 --> 45:19.760
<i>Um, Roger Bowen,
uh, this is my son, Max.</i>

45:19.968 --> 45:21.595
<i>This is his bat.
He left it at school.</i>

45:21.804 --> 45:23.681
<i>Uh, listen, people
are upset and, uh,</i>

45:23.889 --> 45:25.724
<i>we should really...
Calm down, everybody!</i>

45:25.933 --> 45:27.851
<i>This is no way
to handle this situation.</i>

48:04.508 --> 48:05.634
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

48:06.134 --> 48:08.011
I think everybody here
is concerned

48:08.220 --> 48:09.429
about the safety of our streets.

48:09.638 --> 48:12.182
We have got to stick together.

48:12.391 --> 48:14.852
There is a killer in our town.

48:17.271 --> 48:19.189
I look at all these faces
and I...

48:19.398 --> 48:22.150
I don't want to lose
a single one of you.

48:22.359 --> 48:24.027
<i>Beverly made some bars,
and some coffee.</i>

48:24.236 --> 48:25.863
<i>It's on the table.
Help yourself, folks.</i>

48:27.197 --> 48:29.408
And... take care of each other.

48:35.372 --> 48:36.540
<i>Help yourself.</i>

48:37.499 --> 48:38.500
How's Bill?

48:38.709 --> 48:40.419
Oh, I'm worried about him.

48:40.627 --> 48:42.462
He's not feeling well.

48:42.671 --> 48:44.840
And he's so, oh,
down in the dumps.

48:45.048 --> 48:46.300
Uh, he can get that way.

48:46.508 --> 48:48.302
It's a winter thing.

48:48.510 --> 48:50.762
But he hasn't been
out of the house in over a week.

48:50.971 --> 48:52.180
He hasn't been out at all?

48:52.389 --> 48:54.474
Oh, hi, John. No.

48:54.683 --> 48:56.602
It's almost like he's afraid.

48:56.810 --> 48:58.145
<i>I think he's worried
about slipping on the ice</i>

48:58.353 --> 49:00.063
<i>or something.</i>

49:00.272 --> 49:03.734
<i>John? Why don't you
go see him? He'd like that.</i>

49:05.152 --> 49:06.153
<i>Hi, John.</i>

49:06.528 --> 49:07.571
<i>Hey, Brooke.</i>

49:08.614 --> 49:11.199
You want some juice
or hot chocolate?

49:11.408 --> 49:12.951
His stomach is bothering him.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.245
Do you think I could get him
to go to the doctor?

49:15.454 --> 49:17.539
Or you could try this one.

49:17.748 --> 49:19.416
Mixture of rat poison
and metal filings.

49:20.667 --> 49:22.586
Oh, thank you.

49:43.565 --> 49:45.442
<i>Good to see you there.</i>

49:56.453 --> 49:59.665
"On what wings dare he aspire?"

50:00.666 --> 50:02.167
What?

50:02.376 --> 50:04.711
"What the hand...

50:04.920 --> 50:06.755
...dare seize the fire?"

50:10.384 --> 50:12.344
Just a poem.

50:14.805 --> 50:17.182
"Tyger, tyger burning bright

50:17.391 --> 50:19.685
"In the forests of the night

50:22.104 --> 50:24.314
"What immortal hand or eye

50:24.523 --> 50:27.609
could frame thy
fearful symmetry?"

50:35.033 --> 50:36.576
The poet...

50:37.536 --> 50:40.455
...is asking the tiger

50:40.664 --> 50:43.667
who made him and how.

50:50.215 --> 50:51.842
William Blake.

50:53.635 --> 50:55.595
He wrote two poems like that.

50:57.597 --> 51:00.308
"The Lamb" and "The Tyger."

51:02.602 --> 51:05.272
One who was made
of sweetness and love

51:06.481 --> 51:10.610
and one was forged
from terror and death.

51:12.279 --> 51:15.991
"When the stars
threw down their spears

51:16.199 --> 51:18.702
"and watered heaven
with their tears.

51:20.370 --> 51:23.457
"Did he smile his work to see?

51:25.667 --> 51:28.170
Did he who made
the Lamb make thee?"

52:43.537 --> 52:45.497
Hi, Mr. Crowley.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.627
Hi, how are you?

52:51.586 --> 52:52.838
How are you?

52:54.381 --> 52:55.757
How's your leg?

52:55.966 --> 52:57.843
Can I kill you?

53:01.596 --> 53:03.223
<i>And how is school?</i>

53:03.723 --> 53:06.101
It's fine.

53:06.309 --> 53:09.813
Everybody's afraid
but... that's pretty normal.

53:10.021 --> 53:12.232
- And are you afraid?
- No.

53:14.901 --> 53:17.320
Fear is a really weird thing.

53:17.529 --> 53:19.239
You know, people are,
people are afraid of things

53:19.447 --> 53:22.200
but they're never afraid
of their own actions.

53:25.871 --> 53:27.831
Well, it's -- it's like
that woman right there.

53:28.039 --> 53:28.707
<i>You know, she,</i>

53:28.915 --> 53:31.459
<i>she could be afraid
of getting hit by a car.</i>

53:31.668 --> 53:33.587
But she isn't afraid of crossing
the street, you know?

53:33.795 --> 53:35.964
<i>She's done it before.
It should be pretty easy.</i>

53:36.173 --> 53:39.009
She just waits until
she can't see any cars

53:39.217 --> 53:42.345
and cross out
carefully onto the ice.

53:42.554 --> 53:44.764
She's gonna do everything
she can to keep herself safe.

53:46.766 --> 53:48.602
<i>And there, there she goes.</i>

54:00.488 --> 54:01.907
She's fine.
She made it.

54:32.020 --> 54:34.147
He refuses
to go to the doctor.

54:34.356 --> 54:36.358
Oh, stop it woman.

54:36.566 --> 54:38.026
I'll be alright.

54:44.491 --> 54:46.701
Alright.

54:46.910 --> 54:48.995
Lower the seat and the cover.

54:54.876 --> 54:56.002
Oh.

54:57.254 --> 54:58.505
Oh.

54:59.923 --> 55:00.966
<i>Well, that's better.</i>

55:03.260 --> 55:06.721
You've been a big help
to me and Kay this winter, John.

55:09.349 --> 55:12.394
Seems like a dying thing.

55:12.602 --> 55:15.397
<i>Neighbors helping neighbors.</i>

55:17.399 --> 55:20.026
Alright, I've got you.
I've got you.

55:28.493 --> 55:30.954
Oh. Ah.

55:33.873 --> 55:35.875
I worry about her, John.

55:37.877 --> 55:39.713
I can't leave her here alone.

55:41.673 --> 55:43.508
I can't face that.

56:40.148 --> 56:42.067
I know.
What would you do without me?

56:42.275 --> 56:43.443

56:44.402 --> 56:46.404
<i>Chair, downstairs,

Hey, John.

56:55.538 --> 56:57.290
Hey, is she in a good mood?

56:57.499 --> 56:59.959
She's probably slaughtering
a goat in your honor.

57:01.503 --> 57:03.254
Stick close, okay?
I might need backup.

58:06.526 --> 58:08.236
- Very useful, John.
- Mm-hmm.

58:08.445 --> 58:10.488
Guess it makes
a change from soap.

58:25.628 --> 58:27.589
You are gonna be so cool.

58:27.797 --> 58:29.215
Yeah.

58:29.424 --> 58:30.842
Okay.

58:31.050 --> 58:32.594
Here, open these, both of you.

You first.

<i>- Out loud.
- Shh. Just let him read it.</i>

58:43.688 --> 58:44.856
It's okay.

59:05.335 --> 59:07.337

those old tunes?

59:07.545 --> 59:09.964
Sam used to play them
to John in the car.

59:10.173 --> 59:11.966
You'd always be

Damn it, Sam.

- It's empty.
- I'm sorry.

59:31.444 --> 59:33.404

to watch it together.

01:00:39.304 --> 01:00:41.180
I sent you the note.

01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:46.352
Shit.

01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:04.454
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:06.080
<i>You know so much about me</i>

01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:08.625
<i>then you know what I'll do
when I find you.</i>

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:10.043
Shit.

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:19.302
<i>- I said--</i>
- Does that hurt?

01:01:21.554 --> 01:01:22.764
You cut off your own leg.

01:01:22.972 --> 01:01:24.140
You -- you pulled out your lungs

01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:25.850
I just wanna know if it hurts.

01:01:26.059 --> 01:01:28.353
Nothing you do makes sense.

01:01:28.561 --> 01:01:30.355
You -- you -- you
hide some bodies

01:01:30.563 --> 01:01:33.274
you -- you don't hide others,
you're not consistent.

01:01:33.483 --> 01:01:35.401
I -- I -- I just wanna know
does it hurt?

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:36.819
<i>It hurts...</i>

01:01:36.986 --> 01:01:38.154
<i>...like hell.</i>

01:01:38.363 --> 01:01:40.198
<i>It hurts every time.</i>

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:45.161
Do you have to,
do you have to wait?

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:47.705
Like, eh, do you
have to wait

01:01:47.914 --> 01:01:48.873
for something
to -- to break down?

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.041
What about Emmett?

01:01:50.249 --> 01:01:51.751
Uh, E -- E -- Emmett Openshaw

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:53.628
in -- in Arizona?

01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:55.588
Where, what did you,
what did you steal from him?

01:01:58.591 --> 01:02:01.260
<i>I stole his life.</i>

01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:02.762
<i>He would have had
a long one, I think.</i>

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:05.640
<i>As long as this at least.</i>

01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:08.518
<i>He would have
gotten married and had kids.</i>

01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:13.731
<i>You still don't know, do you?</i>

01:02:18.903 --> 01:02:20.071
<i>Hang on.</i>

01:02:25.368 --> 01:02:27.620
<i>I've taken more lives
than you can ever guess.</i>

01:02:29.539 --> 01:02:32.375
<i>But the mechanic was
the first one I didn't keep.</i>

01:02:34.043 --> 01:02:35.169
What was that?

01:02:37.213 --> 01:02:38.756
<i>What was what?</i>

01:02:38.965 --> 01:02:40.508
What was that noise?

01:03:35.188 --> 01:03:36.105
Hey, John.

01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:56.125
So, what have you been up to?

01:03:56.334 --> 01:03:58.878
I barely seen you
since the holidays.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:01.422
What does a young psychotic

01:04:01.631 --> 01:04:03.800
John Wayne Cleaver
do in his spare time?

01:04:13.059 --> 01:04:14.977
Hello? Earth to John.

01:04:15.186 --> 01:04:17.396
Wanna tell me
what the crap's going on, man?

01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:18.481
<i>Uh.</i>

01:04:23.194 --> 01:04:24.529
Uh.

01:04:26.197 --> 01:04:28.533
It's nothing, um...

01:04:29.325 --> 01:04:30.451
I just...

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.161
I need to do
normal stuff right now.

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:33.746
Umm.

01:04:33.955 --> 01:04:35.540
Do you wanna play the game?

01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:38.292
Why are you here, John?

01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:40.127
On Christmas night,
when I haven't seen you

01:04:40.336 --> 01:04:42.547
in not one week,
but two weeks?

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.384
<i>I'm -- I'm just
kinda losing it.</i>

01:04:46.592 --> 01:04:47.927
<i>- Losing what?
- I'm losing it.</i>

01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:50.513
I'm -- I'm -- I'm breaking
all my rules.

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:51.722
<i>What rules?</i>

01:04:53.683 --> 01:04:55.643
I have rules
to keep me normal

01:04:55.852 --> 01:04:57.186
<i>and to keep
everybody else safe.</i>

01:04:57.395 --> 01:05:00.064
One -- one of my rules is that
I need to hang out with you

01:05:00.273 --> 01:05:02.400
because we do normal stuff.

01:05:02.608 --> 01:05:04.986
Um, and I -- I need that.

01:05:07.363 --> 01:05:09.323
So, we've been friends
for three years

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:11.534
'cause you think
it makes your normal?

01:05:18.457 --> 01:05:19.667
Eh, yeah.

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:56.555
Get off of him!

01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:02.645
He's not yours.

01:07:55.489 --> 01:07:56.782
John.

01:08:08.127 --> 01:08:09.045
<i>John?</i>

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.881
Don't you think we should talk?

01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:20.848
Talk about what?

01:08:21.057 --> 01:08:22.767
I know this is difficult.

01:08:22.975 --> 01:08:24.852
I -- I can't imagine
what you must be going through

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.647
but, you -- you've barely
said a word to me in days.

01:08:28.856 --> 01:08:30.441
I've barely said a word
to you since fourth grade.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:31.817
Then maybe we should start.

01:08:32.026 --> 01:08:34.403
- Dr. Neblin --
- Dr. Neblin needs to shut up.

01:08:34.612 --> 01:08:35.821
<i>He -- he's just
trying to help you.</i>

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:38.823
We, we all just wanna do
what's best for you.

01:08:39.033 --> 01:08:41.952
Just tell me
what you're feeling.

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:46.165
What don't you get?

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.085
I don't feel anything.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.796
Okay? I don't -- I don't give
a shit that Max's Dad is dead!

01:08:52.004 --> 01:08:53.798
I don't give a shit
that you could be next!

01:08:58.636 --> 01:09:00.470
John, I'm so sorry.

01:09:02.765 --> 01:09:04.225
- John, please.
- Stop!

01:09:04.433 --> 01:09:07.394
- I just wanna --
- No, shut up, shut up!

01:09:07.603 --> 01:09:09.395
You shut up!

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:31.961
<i>John.</i>

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:36.173
John, I won't come in.
I just wanna say something.

01:09:42.388 --> 01:09:43.848
Last night was...

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.769
<i>But we're still
together, right?</i>

01:09:48.978 --> 01:09:51.981
<i>I mean, we're still a family.</i>

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:54.692
<i>Because it's all we got.</i>

01:09:57.194 --> 01:09:59.655
I thought you helping
us embalm was bad for you

01:09:59.864 --> 01:10:02.241
but I think now
maybe I was wrong.

01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:04.994
I don't know.

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:08.372
All I do know is

01:10:08.581 --> 01:10:10.708
you've gotten worse
since I stopped you

01:10:12.418 --> 01:10:13.961
and yet that was where
I felt closest to you

01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:17.381
so... if that's
what it takes

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:19.258
<i>for us to stay together</i>

01:10:19.466 --> 01:10:21.010
<i>then that's what we do.</i>

01:10:25.097 --> 01:10:26.348
<i>Let's say that
you're the kind of person</i>

01:10:26.557 --> 01:10:29.476
<i>who, uh, you know, you leave
when things get bad.</i>

01:10:29.685 --> 01:10:31.020
You've done it a lot.

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:33.564
Uh, you make a life,
you always get into trouble

01:10:33.772 --> 01:10:34.690
and then you always run away.

01:10:34.899 --> 01:10:36.192
<i>Now, things are bad.</i>

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.026
<i>They're worse than
they've ever been</i>

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:39.486
but you don't leave, you stay.

01:10:39.695 --> 01:10:41.071
Why would you do that?

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.240
<i>You're talking
about risk and reward.</i>

01:10:43.449 --> 01:10:44.783
Stay and bear the hardship

01:10:44.992 --> 01:10:46.952
or escape with the cost
of losing something.

01:10:48.454 --> 01:10:49.997
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

01:10:50.206 --> 01:10:52.082
No, I just want your opinion.
What would make you stay?

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:55.502
Am I a sociopath?

01:10:55.711 --> 01:10:58.130
- It's not me.
- I never said it was.

01:10:58.339 --> 01:10:59.840
But I need to know
because I need to understand

01:11:00.049 --> 01:11:02.468
if I'm answering from an
emotional point of view or not.

01:11:02.676 --> 01:11:04.720
- What's the difference?
<i>- It's everything.</i>

01:11:04.929 --> 01:11:06.472
You say I can up and leave,
but I have to ask myself

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.224
what it is I'm leaving.

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:11.060
<i>What emotional connection
is being broken.</i>

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:14.271
<i>Now, if I'm a sociopath
then it might not bother me</i>

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.023
<i>but if I'm not...</i>

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.568
- Love.
- Love, yes.

01:11:19.777 --> 01:11:21.946
An emotional connection
like love.

01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:24.990
Okay. Thank you.

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:27.117
Wait, wait, John,
hold on, hold on.

01:11:29.995 --> 01:11:31.330
Alright, look, call me

01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:33.123
if there's anything
you need, day or night.

01:11:33.958 --> 01:11:35.167
Yeah, okay.

01:11:39.838 --> 01:11:41.423
<i>Can I look at that one?</i>

01:11:48.097 --> 01:11:51.475
What's the, what's the range
on something like that?

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.937
I don't know,
like, 2 to 3 miles.

01:11:57.064 --> 01:11:58.524
Okay.

01:11:58.732 --> 01:12:00.401
How much can I get for that?

01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:04.822
I don't know,
like, 20 to 30 bucks.

01:12:07.908 --> 01:12:10.869
- Hi, Mrs. C.
- Oh, hello, John.

01:12:11.078 --> 01:12:12.913
<i>- I can help you with that.</i>
- Thanks.

01:12:14.832 --> 01:12:16.292
So, uh, how's Bill?

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.253
<i>Oh, not so well, John.</i>

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:22.423
It's his heart.

01:12:22.631 --> 01:12:24.425
Just his age, John.

01:12:24.633 --> 01:12:26.302
Everything is catchin' up
with him.

01:12:27.886 --> 01:12:30.931
Pills, pills.

01:12:31.098 --> 01:12:34.143
My whole existence
has become pills.

01:12:34.977 --> 01:12:38.105
Damn this body of mine, damn.

01:16:18.283 --> 01:16:19.660
- No!
- Stop it.

01:16:19.868 --> 01:16:21.245
Shh. Shh.

01:16:21.453 --> 01:16:24.790
Stop it!
Just stop, stop!

01:16:28.794 --> 01:16:30.045
Shh! Shh!

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.081
<i>Hello.</i>

01:17:07.374 --> 01:17:09.209
I've -- I've done it.

01:17:09.418 --> 01:17:11.086
It's too late.

01:17:12.546 --> 01:17:13.880
<i>John, where are you?</i>

01:17:14.089 --> 01:17:17.301
I'm -- I'm on the edge and...

01:17:17.509 --> 01:17:20.345
<i>...I'm over it
and I'm falling.</i>

01:17:20.554 --> 01:17:22.222
<i>- Listen to me, John.</i>
- I didn't wanna do it.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:26.727
<i>Listen to me, listen.</i>

01:17:26.935 --> 01:17:30.439
- It's too late.
<i>- No, John, it's not too late.</i>

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:32.691
<i>You're in control.
Are you listening?</i>

01:17:34.818 --> 01:17:36.320
Yes.

01:17:36.528 --> 01:17:38.238
<i>Now, listen.</i>

01:17:38.447 --> 01:17:39.990
<i>You're not a killer,
you're a good person, John.</i>

01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:42.784
<i>And whatever you've done
we can get through it.</i>

01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:45.245
<i>We can make it right again.
Are you still listening?</i>

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.458
Thank you. I need to go.

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:51.251
<i>No, John, don't hang up.
Tell me where you are.</i>

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.378
No. Thank you for your help.

01:18:37.172 --> 01:18:39.383
- Mary Jean, put that back!
- Oh!

01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:03.031
<i>Come back.</i>

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:07.744
Come back and die
with your own heart.

01:19:10.163 --> 01:19:11.790
Look at your phone!

01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:13.625
<i>Look at your phone!</i>

01:19:13.834 --> 01:19:15.669
You're not gonna kill anybody.

01:21:10.492 --> 01:21:12.410
You can't have his heart.

01:23:34.386 --> 01:23:36.429
- Photoshop?
- Yeah.

01:23:36.638 --> 01:23:38.181
Sweet.

01:23:54.155 --> 01:23:55.365
<i>We are gathered here today</i>

01:23:55.573 --> 01:23:57.450
<i>to celebrate the life</i>

01:23:57.659 --> 01:23:58.743
<i>and mourn the passing</i>

01:23:58.952 --> 01:24:01.705
<i>of Roger Bowen.</i>

01:24:01.913 --> 01:24:03.248
It is fitting
that we do so here

01:24:03.456 --> 01:24:05.208
surrounded by all those

01:24:05.417 --> 01:24:07.585
who loved and admired him.

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:11.131
Great evil has befallen our town

01:24:11.339 --> 01:24:14.843
and many families
are in mourning today.

01:24:15.051 --> 01:24:17.345
<i>Roger was a husband</i>

01:24:17.554 --> 01:24:19.764
<i>and a father.</i>

01:24:19.973 --> 01:24:22.684
<i>He was a friend to all.</i>

01:24:22.892 --> 01:24:25.603
<i>He was a pillar
of our community.</i>

01:24:25.812 --> 01:24:28.189
<i>He was a pillar of his church.</i>

01:24:28.398 --> 01:24:31.317
<i>And he was a pillar
in his own household.</i>

01:24:31.526 --> 01:24:32.944
But before you think
I'm building

01:24:33.153 --> 01:24:35.864
some kind of Greek temple
with all them pillars

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:37.824
<i>Roger's about as
down to Earth a guy</i>

01:24:38.033 --> 01:24:39.784
<i>as you'd ever wanna know.</i>

01:24:39.993 --> 01:24:43.288
<i>Steadfast, honest,
hardworking.</i>

01:24:43.496 --> 01:24:46.291
<i>The kind of man who's
character embodies the values</i>

01:24:46.499 --> 01:24:48.752
<i>that a community is all about.</i>

01:25:18.114 --> 01:25:20.700
You attacked my wife.

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.248
You murdered my therapist.

01:25:30.877 --> 01:25:33.922
That's what he was doing
out there

01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:36.049
at that hour

01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:38.760
on a street

01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:41.262
carrying about
in his nightgown

01:25:41.471 --> 01:25:43.431
out looking for some kid.

01:25:45.975 --> 01:25:47.602
I couldn't help him.

01:25:52.315 --> 01:25:53.817
Where is it?

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.821
How long do you think
you've got?

01:25:59.447 --> 01:26:01.574
Long enough to find another.

01:26:02.909 --> 01:26:04.202
Not here.

01:26:06.037 --> 01:26:07.956
Not in front of everybody.

01:26:08.164 --> 01:26:11.251
You don't know
the things I've done

01:26:11.459 --> 01:26:14.462
or that I will do.

01:26:14.671 --> 01:26:16.381
Don't forget to take
the book of condolence

01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:18.341
to the cemetery, John.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.428
<i>The family is so grateful</i>

01:26:22.637 --> 01:26:24.764
<i>for all your
wonderful cards and flowers</i>

01:26:24.973 --> 01:26:28.393
<i>and, and some of you
have asked about donations.</i>

01:26:28.601 --> 01:26:31.813
But the family would prefer
any donations to be made

01:26:32.021 --> 01:26:33.982
in Roger's name

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:37.277
to the organ donor foundation.

01:26:37.485 --> 01:26:40.280
<i>Following his kidney
replacements techniques.</i>

01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:52.375
<i>Thank you so much
for coming out.</i>

01:27:32.498 --> 01:27:35.210
<i>John? You coming?</i>

01:27:35.418 --> 01:27:38.630
Ah, no, I'm gonna stay behind
and start cleaning stuff up.

01:27:38.838 --> 01:27:40.256
Okay, you go with mom.

01:27:40.465 --> 01:27:42.467
Mom already left
in the hearse with Margaret.

01:27:44.427 --> 01:27:46.846
No, she's taking her own car.
She just went upstairs.

01:28:05.114 --> 01:28:06.699
Mom?

01:28:10.036 --> 01:28:11.371
Mom?

01:28:52.495 --> 01:28:54.956
Where have you hidden it?

01:28:56.499 --> 01:28:58.167
It's him, not it.

01:29:00.753 --> 01:29:02.338
I need that heart.

01:29:04.257 --> 01:29:05.758
Or any heart.

01:29:14.392 --> 01:29:15.393
Okay?

01:29:16.811 --> 01:29:18.271
<i>You love her?</i>

01:29:18.479 --> 01:29:21.733
Why do you think
I stayed human all these years?

01:29:24.944 --> 01:29:27.780
You love her?

01:29:37.123 --> 01:29:39.834
Do you think
I wouldn't do it, John?

01:29:41.085 --> 01:29:43.004
<i>After all I've done?</i>

01:29:46.841 --> 01:29:48.885
Where is that body?

01:29:53.348 --> 01:29:54.724
Where?

01:29:59.771 --> 01:30:01.647
It's in the freezer.

01:30:16.954 --> 01:30:18.081
John?

01:30:18.915 --> 01:30:20.625
What is this?

01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:22.794
It's the one who's been
killing everybody.

01:30:23.002 --> 01:30:24.379
<i>He attacked me.</i>

01:30:25.922 --> 01:30:27.590
<i>- Is he dead?</i>
- Mom.

01:30:27.799 --> 01:30:29.217
Not he, it.

01:30:29.425 --> 01:30:30.802
- We need to call the police.
- No!

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:31.969
<i>Mom, listen. Listen to me.</i>

01:30:32.178 --> 01:30:34.389
You can't do that.
Mom, I tried.

01:30:34.597 --> 01:30:36.182
He killed them.

01:30:39.477 --> 01:30:41.229
Mom. Please, help me.

01:30:54.659 --> 01:30:55.910
Scissors.

01:31:43.499 --> 01:31:44.750
Turn it on.

01:32:18.534 --> 01:32:19.619
John.

01:32:22.163 --> 01:32:23.789
It hurts.

01:34:14.108 --> 01:34:15.776
John...

01:34:40.551 --> 01:34:43.512
Look after Kay for me.

01:35:04.659 --> 01:35:07.620
"Tyger, tyger

01:35:07.828 --> 01:35:09.372
burning bright..."

01:36:14.895 --> 01:36:17.064
<i>While police are waiting
to release any further details</i>

01:36:17.273 --> 01:36:19.233
<i>all they can confirm
that a potential homicide</i>

01:36:19.442 --> 01:36:21.652
<i>investigation is underway.</i>

01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:24.196
<i>Clayton County police are also
looking for another man</i>

01:36:24.405 --> 01:36:26.532
<i>Bill Crowley, age 79</i>

01:36:26.741 --> 01:36:28.284
<i>who disappeared
the night before</i>

01:36:28.492 --> 01:36:30.327
<i>Dr. Neblin's body was found.</i>

01:36:30.536 --> 01:36:33.038
<i>Local authorities
are asking for anyone</i>

01:36:33.247 --> 01:36:35.958
<i>with information
to please come forward.</i>

01:36:40.087 --> 01:36:41.464
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

01:36:41.756 --> 01:36:43.340
About Bill?

01:36:46.427 --> 01:36:50.055
I met Bill,
we were both in our 30s.

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.768
And in those days,
in this town, being 30

01:36:53.976 --> 01:36:56.520
and single
made me an old maid.

01:36:58.105 --> 01:37:00.733
He reminded me
a bit of my grandfather

01:37:00.941 --> 01:37:02.568
the way he always wore a hat.

01:37:04.278 --> 01:37:06.864
He had this lust for life.
I...

01:37:07.072 --> 01:37:09.784
I set my sights on him after
the first couple of weeks.

01:37:11.368 --> 01:37:14.580
<i>One Sunday, we were having
dinner at my parents' house</i>

01:37:14.789 --> 01:37:18.042
with all my brothers
and sisters and

01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:20.377
all their families and...

01:37:22.338 --> 01:37:24.340
Bill got up and left the table.

01:37:27.384 --> 01:37:29.595
I followed him out
and found him in the kitchen...

01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:34.016
...crying.

01:37:34.183 --> 01:37:37.812
He said, "I never got it
before now, Kay."

01:37:38.354 --> 01:37:40.815
And he told me...

01:37:41.023 --> 01:37:42.358
...he loved me...

01:37:44.610 --> 01:37:47.571
...more than anything
in heaven or hell.

01:37:52.576 --> 01:37:54.870
He was very romantic
with his words.

01:37:57.248 --> 01:38:00.292
<i>In his last days,
he was more...</i>

01:38:01.377 --> 01:38:02.419
<i>...sickness than health.</i>

01:38:02.586 --> 01:38:04.380
<i>You saw the way he was.</i>

01:38:06.507 --> 01:38:10.344
But every day
he'd tell me

01:38:12.096 --> 01:38:15.891
"I will stay by
your side forever."

01:38:21.522 --> 01:38:24.483
Oh, that dreaded thing.

01:38:25.734 --> 01:38:27.987
It hasn't been the same
since that night.

01:38:39.832 --> 01:38:43.252
<i>You know, we can arrange for
you to see a grief counselor</i>

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:44.712
<i>if you'd like.</i>

01:38:46.505 --> 01:38:49.258
I think that... seeing
a psychotherapist to talk

01:38:49.466 --> 01:38:52.177
about my first therapist
seems...

01:38:52.386 --> 01:38:53.929
...kinda disloyal.

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.518
Neblin would have
laughed at that.

01:38:59.727 --> 01:39:02.021
