WEBVTT

00:00.711 --> 00:03.344
Jeff, we've known each other
a long time, right?

00:03.379 --> 00:05.080
You've come to respect me.

00:05.114 --> 00:08.283
- Sure.
- Well, get ready to stop.

00:08.318 --> 00:10.552
Please help me seduce Britta

00:10.586 --> 00:12.187
now that you've
finished doing it with her.

00:12.221 --> 00:13.221
Please, please...

00:13.256 --> 00:14.656
Do you even really like Britta?

00:14.691 --> 00:16.658
It seems like you like her
because she doesn't like you.

00:16.693 --> 00:19.027
Have you met the women
that do like me, Jeff?

00:19.062 --> 00:20.996
Neither have I, but trust me,
they're bad people.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.097
Fine.

00:22.131 --> 00:24.466
To get near Britta,
think like Britta.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.435
Grab one of those free papers
for hippies on the quad,

00:26.469 --> 00:27.669
go to the calendar page,

00:27.704 --> 00:29.705
and find a cause so tragic...

00:29.739 --> 00:30.939
Are you writing this down?

00:30.973 --> 00:33.542
Okay, we have confirmation
that all the bones

00:33.576 --> 00:35.377
have been removed
from the football field.

00:35.411 --> 00:36.745
And we agree
that teachers should get

00:36.779 --> 00:38.613
a 10-minute head start
at the job fair.

00:38.648 --> 00:41.016
Any other items?

00:41.050 --> 00:42.517
It's Friday night.

00:42.552 --> 00:43.952
What's everybody doing?

00:43.987 --> 00:47.556
Oh, there's a benefit show
at the Forefront Theater

00:47.590 --> 00:50.292
in Riverside for starving children

00:50.326 --> 00:51.660
with cleft palates.

00:51.694 --> 00:53.195
Aw.

00:53.229 --> 00:54.830
I'm gonna crash the premiere
of the Kickpuncher reboot

00:54.864 --> 00:57.065
dressed like classic Kickpuncher.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.900
They shouldn't
have redesigned that costume.

00:58.935 --> 01:00.802
Keep your heads
in the sand if you want.

01:00.837 --> 01:03.972
Professor Duncan, I didn't
know that cause interested you.

01:04.007 --> 01:06.441
Well, it's starving children
with cleft palates, Britta.

01:06.476 --> 01:09.144
What part would you have me
be disinterested in?

01:09.178 --> 01:10.779
- Forefront Theater?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10.813 --> 01:12.981
What time? I'm going.

01:13.016 --> 01:15.050
- I'm going too.
- Me too.

01:15.084 --> 01:17.853
Kids with cleft palates should
have extra food, not less.

01:17.887 --> 01:19.221
I'm in.

01:19.255 --> 01:22.924
I have... dinner plans.

01:24.093 --> 01:26.161
Yeah, make sure it's a hearty meal.

01:26.195 --> 01:28.297
- Oh, boo.
- Help me out here.

01:28.331 --> 01:30.399
Um, well, uh...

01:30.433 --> 01:34.236
Pfft, are you really the one
that needs help here, Winger?

01:34.270 --> 01:36.672
Yeah, should we write
a check to the Jeff Foundation?

01:36.706 --> 01:39.107
Okay. Maybe I'll go too.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.876
Well, it's the least you can do.

01:40.910 --> 01:42.878
Yeah, feels good to help.

01:42.912 --> 01:45.480
God bless you.

01:45.515 --> 01:47.842
Cool, so 7:30?

02:16.613 --> 02:18.513
Did you get it?
I don't think I got it.

02:18.548 --> 02:20.282
Well, the ants were people.

02:20.316 --> 02:22.250
The Queen Ant was an oil company.

02:22.285 --> 02:24.353
Okay, so it was about
our marginalized perceptions

02:24.387 --> 02:27.456
as drones being born
into a corporate hive-mind?

02:27.490 --> 02:28.557
- Yeah.
- Mm.

02:28.591 --> 02:31.460
- Wow. McDonald's?
- Oh, I was just thinking about that.

02:31.494 --> 02:32.961
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm, hungry.

02:32.996 --> 02:34.263
Hello?

02:34.297 --> 02:35.898
Okay, Alessandra,
I can't talk right now.

02:35.932 --> 02:38.333
I just got out of a show.

02:38.368 --> 02:41.603
Okay, hold on.

02:41.638 --> 02:43.939
Well?

02:43.973 --> 02:46.174
Look, if you're gonna
just yell at me, why...

02:46.209 --> 02:48.243
Why are you doing this?

02:48.277 --> 02:50.712
This is not happening
to you, okay?

02:50.747 --> 02:52.681
It's happening to us!

02:52.715 --> 02:54.917
Well, you called me!

02:54.951 --> 02:59.287
Well, then let me
be the one to do this!

03:09.565 --> 03:13.880
Uh, my mother used to tell a story
about how she killed a chicken.

03:16.439 --> 03:19.641
Hong Kong, 1964.

03:19.676 --> 03:21.109
So you like the theatre, Ian?

03:21.144 --> 03:22.377
Oh, are you kidding?

03:22.412 --> 03:25.547
I spent half my days at
university in wigs and tights.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.416
You don't do that without
befriending some actors.

03:27.450 --> 03:29.084
Hm.

03:29.118 --> 03:30.319
Oh, my God, Michael.

03:30.353 --> 03:32.521
I know Michael
from my anarchist days.

03:32.555 --> 03:35.524
God, he's gonna
smell the sellout on me.

03:37.627 --> 03:39.428
Hey. How's it goin'?

03:39.462 --> 03:40.529
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

03:40.563 --> 03:41.863
What's going on?

03:41.898 --> 03:43.665
I don't like this "my-kale" guy.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.834
I don't think he likes himself,
or he'd pronounce it "Michael."

03:45.868 --> 03:46.902
Isn't she great?

03:46.936 --> 03:48.870
She's everything
I love about America.

03:48.905 --> 03:52.274
Bold, opinionated,
just past her peak,

03:52.308 --> 03:54.910
and starting to realize
that she has to settle for less.

03:54.944 --> 03:57.245
And the moment she needs
a shoulder to cry on,

03:57.280 --> 03:58.513
bam.

03:58.548 --> 04:00.015
Huh?
The Duncan handkerchief.

04:00.049 --> 04:01.350
Well, I'm out.

04:01.384 --> 04:03.251
Have fun circling my former lover,

04:03.286 --> 04:06.254
waiting for her to cry.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.422
I tried to make that sound good,

04:07.457 --> 04:09.191
but that's what you're doin'.

04:09.225 --> 04:11.460
Eh.

04:11.494 --> 04:14.596
Uh, you're all heroes tonight
for making a difference,

04:14.631 --> 04:17.966
but I want to introduce
one of my heroes.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.002
- Britta Perry.
- Oh.

04:21.803 --> 04:26.174
She is the bravest,
most passionate activist

04:26.209 --> 04:28.710
I have ever had
the honor of imitating.

04:28.745 --> 04:30.612
So, hey, buy her a drink.

04:31.714 --> 04:32.781
Anything you wanna add, Britta?

04:32.815 --> 04:35.717
Oh. Wow, um, I'm not a hero.

04:35.752 --> 04:38.553
I'm a high school dropout
and a bartender,

04:38.588 --> 04:40.022
so don't listen to me.

04:42.425 --> 04:43.925
Or anyone.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.961
Just listen to yourself,

04:45.995 --> 04:48.697
and make sure
you tell yourself the truth.

04:50.767 --> 04:53.402
Well, it was...
it was great seeing you, so...

04:53.436 --> 04:54.636
I might stay for one drink.

04:54.671 --> 04:57.039
- Why?
- I like to drink.

04:57.073 --> 04:59.508
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I have a serious problem.

04:59.542 --> 05:01.143
That had better be true.

05:07.984 --> 05:10.919
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

05:19.562 --> 05:20.963
I am Kickpuncher.

05:20.997 --> 05:22.998
You are in violation of future law.

05:25.635 --> 05:27.102
Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!

05:27.136 --> 05:29.104
Pew! Pew!

05:32.875 --> 05:35.577
Oh. Damn it, come on.

05:39.215 --> 05:41.950
- What are you doing?
- What?

05:41.985 --> 05:43.185
What... what are you doing?

05:43.219 --> 05:44.519
Making a costume
for a movie premiere.

05:44.554 --> 05:45.821
Annie banned glue guns
from the apartment

05:45.855 --> 05:47.856
after an incident so hilarious
that even describing it

05:47.890 --> 05:49.424
would narratively eclipse
what's happening here.

05:49.459 --> 05:51.693
- What's happening here?
- You and me bonding.

05:51.728 --> 05:52.828
Check it out.

05:56.099 --> 05:58.267
Tell me the truth: if you were
a post-apocalyptic survivor...

05:58.301 --> 06:00.202
I would raise goats,
hoard cinnamon,

06:00.236 --> 06:01.436
and travel only at night.

06:01.471 --> 06:04.206
But, please,
I have some work to do here.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.280
Just one thing. Watch this.

06:05.308 --> 06:07.376
Initiate ballistic foam.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.467
Oops.

06:21.491 --> 06:23.225
- What the hell?
- Sorry.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.661
You just destroyed
five hours of work!

06:25.695 --> 06:29.264
- I'll clean it up.
- No, you don't touch it!

06:31.768 --> 06:33.135
I know this is bad timing,

06:33.169 --> 06:36.171
but I should go if
I'm gonna make the movie, so...

06:38.307 --> 06:39.941
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

06:39.976 --> 06:42.477
Something nobody ever does.

06:42.512 --> 06:46.248
Teaching you consequences.

06:46.282 --> 06:47.916
- But I have to go.
- But you can't.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.318
Huh, isn't that crazy?

06:49.352 --> 06:51.286
You ever been grounded?
You ever been punished?

06:51.321 --> 06:53.288
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

06:53.323 --> 06:54.723
to be refused something?

06:54.757 --> 06:57.459
I know what it feels like
when people try to control me.

06:57.493 --> 06:58.894
You should know
it never goes their way.

06:58.928 --> 07:00.162
Ooh.

07:00.196 --> 07:02.798
And what "kicky-punch" movie
is that from?

07:02.832 --> 07:04.233
The ones you've seen

07:04.267 --> 07:06.201
or the one I'm gonna watch you miss?

07:12.793 --> 07:14.994
I said I was sorry.

07:15.028 --> 07:16.629
I'm sorry I punched my landlord,

07:16.663 --> 07:18.598
but I'm not gettin' my deposit back.

07:18.632 --> 07:21.033
That's an example of you being punished
for choosing to hurt someone.

07:21.068 --> 07:22.201
I wrecked your papers by accident.

07:22.236 --> 07:25.137
You chose
to spray this crap on purpose

07:25.172 --> 07:26.839
because you didn't care
what happened.

07:26.873 --> 07:28.074
You know,
let me tell you something.

07:28.108 --> 07:30.243
For five years,
I have watched people

07:30.277 --> 07:32.078
walk around on your eggshells.

07:32.112 --> 07:35.248
"Oh, Abed.
He's so imaginative, so magical.

07:35.282 --> 07:36.849
"Everybody hide their hamburgers!

07:36.883 --> 07:39.952
"If Abed sees a hamburger,
we'll all travel in time.

07:39.987 --> 07:41.721
"Let's eat cookies and ice cream

07:41.755 --> 07:44.190
and dress in pajamas
in the middle of the day."

07:44.224 --> 07:47.193
I watched my third wife die!

07:50.097 --> 07:51.831
You think I'm spoiled?

07:51.865 --> 07:53.599
And you think I'm spoiled
because it's never occurred

07:53.634 --> 07:55.368
to anyone to do this?

07:55.402 --> 07:57.003
You're not the Marco Polo
of bullying me.

07:57.004 --> 07:59.138
You're just another tourist
taking pictures of a great, big wall.

07:59.172 --> 08:00.840
Oh, you're gonna make me cry.

08:00.874 --> 08:02.475
When's the last time
someone physically limited you?

08:02.509 --> 08:03.509
Oh, just now.

08:03.543 --> 08:07.680
You physically ruined my drawings.

08:07.714 --> 08:11.117
Drawings of what?

08:11.151 --> 08:14.020
You're an artist?

08:14.054 --> 08:17.957
I destroyed something valuable?

08:20.018 --> 08:21.538
Looked like you
were doodling chickens.

08:21.562 --> 08:23.563
He is a duck!

08:23.597 --> 08:25.631
Uh-oh.

08:27.401 --> 08:30.002
Hey!

08:30.037 --> 08:32.337
You're not allowed in there.

08:32.371 --> 08:33.706
Well, I just did a one-man show

08:33.740 --> 08:35.775
for a little audience
that would beg to disagree.

08:35.808 --> 08:38.210
Audience? In there?

08:38.245 --> 08:41.179
We haven't had
a single person or performance

08:41.214 --> 08:45.017
in that theater since the 1997 fire.

08:45.052 --> 08:48.921
24 people died.

08:48.956 --> 08:50.756
So what have you guys been up to?

08:50.791 --> 08:51.924
Well, this. Raising money.

08:51.959 --> 08:53.793
Organizing.
Trying to make a difference.

08:53.827 --> 08:55.461
I'm impressed, and embarrassed.

08:55.495 --> 08:56.495
I sold out.

08:56.496 --> 08:58.264
- We sold out.
- You did not sell out.

08:58.298 --> 09:00.933
I'm going to community college
to start a career.

09:00.968 --> 09:02.101
We're in real estate.

09:02.135 --> 09:03.970
We own the building
we're standing in.

09:04.004 --> 09:06.505
Wow. You guys did sell out!

09:06.540 --> 09:07.840
I know!

09:07.875 --> 09:10.476
I should introduce myself
to her friends.

09:10.510 --> 09:11.744
I knew it!

09:11.778 --> 09:13.312
You don't have a drinking problem!

09:13.347 --> 09:15.982
You have feelings for Britta,
you disgusting monster!

09:16.016 --> 09:17.049
Fine. Yes.

09:17.084 --> 09:19.118
Something about everybody liking her
turns me on.

09:19.152 --> 09:20.453
It's a problem I have.

09:20.487 --> 09:22.788
I hated Reese's pieces
before E.T. ate them, sorry.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.858
- You're a bad friend!
- That's not fair!

09:25.893 --> 09:28.628
Wait, that's really not fair.
You're a terrible friend.

09:28.662 --> 09:29.896
She was mine first.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.097
And it's not like
she belongs to anybody.

09:31.131 --> 09:32.431
Oh, here we go.

09:32.466 --> 09:34.867
"Love isn't a game,"
say the guys that always win.

09:34.901 --> 09:36.869
And now, you're going
to go pull a Dane Cook

09:36.904 --> 09:38.404
in one of those
three movies he was in

09:38.438 --> 09:40.873
about Dane Cook
getting laid by accident.

09:40.908 --> 09:44.010
Only it's not
a Dane Cook movie, Jeff,

09:44.044 --> 09:47.446
because this time,
someone's watching: me.

09:47.481 --> 09:50.183
Your friend, British Jason Biggs.

09:50.217 --> 09:54.453
If you never call me Dane Cook
again, I'll stand down...

09:54.488 --> 09:55.488
for an hour.

09:55.522 --> 09:57.957
Okay. An hour.

10:01.495 --> 10:03.195
Are your duck drawings a secret?

10:03.230 --> 10:04.730
Is that why you do 'em
when nobody's around?

10:04.765 --> 10:06.599
Not that it's any of your business,

10:06.633 --> 10:08.834
but I am a cartoonist
in my spare time.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.637
My cartoon's about a duck.
I was drawing him.

10:11.672 --> 10:14.140
Does the duck have a name?
Does he have powers?

10:14.174 --> 10:16.142
I'm not pitching to you.

10:16.176 --> 10:17.677
You're afraid I won't like it.

10:17.711 --> 10:18.811
Sure.

10:18.845 --> 10:21.280
I've been a cab driver,
a soldier, a cop,

10:21.315 --> 10:24.217
but what terrifies me the most
is the opinion

10:24.251 --> 10:26.385
of a manchild in cardboard pants.

10:26.420 --> 10:29.055
Kickpuncher was a cop
before he became a cyborg.

10:29.089 --> 10:31.958
So you were a cop
before you became... this.

10:31.992 --> 10:36.395
And what were you before this?
Were you normal?

10:36.430 --> 10:37.496
Or do you act like this

10:37.531 --> 10:39.365
because somebody
stuffed you in a locker?

10:39.399 --> 10:40.499
Is that the idea?

10:40.534 --> 10:42.301
Other way around.

10:42.336 --> 10:43.502
What else do you
want to know about me?

10:43.537 --> 10:44.658
What makes you stop talking.

10:44.671 --> 10:46.339
- Letting me go.
- After you miss your movie.

10:46.373 --> 10:48.241
Because you want me to suffer.

10:48.275 --> 10:50.776
For destroying your duck cartoons?

10:50.811 --> 10:53.746
The ones you're ashamed of?

11:15.269 --> 11:18.604
Uh, which one were you laughing at?

11:20.540 --> 11:22.308
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop that!

11:22.342 --> 11:23.709
You're ghosts!

11:23.744 --> 11:24.911
We're ghosts?

11:24.945 --> 11:27.546
The janitor out there
told me you died in 1997.

11:27.581 --> 11:30.750
Janitor?

11:30.784 --> 11:32.518
Hey!

11:32.553 --> 11:33.719
Those guys in there told me

11:33.754 --> 11:35.388
that you're the one
that died in a fire

11:35.422 --> 11:36.689
and you're a ghost!

11:36.723 --> 11:38.958
And you just believed 'em?

11:38.992 --> 11:42.695
You just believed a bunch of ghosts?

11:49.203 --> 11:50.570
Have you guys

11:50.604 --> 11:54.507
seen that billboard on Water Street
for Consensual Perfume?

11:54.541 --> 11:56.509
The one with the man chasing
the woman through the grass

11:56.543 --> 11:58.044
and it says, "Proven in its field"?

11:58.078 --> 12:01.380
Yeah, proven in its field
and in labs on the eyeballs of rabbits.

12:01.415 --> 12:04.517
We should make it say that!
Who's got the spray paint?

12:06.253 --> 12:07.887
No, guys, I'm serious!

12:07.921 --> 12:09.655
Doug and Janet, you're on lookout.

12:09.690 --> 12:12.959
Michael works the ladder.
I will banksy that mother!

12:12.993 --> 12:15.494
Come on, guys, we gotta
start taking risks again.

12:15.529 --> 12:18.798
Well, that's convenient for
the one with nothing to lose.

12:21.034 --> 12:23.669
Oh, so the person
with the least wealth

12:23.704 --> 12:25.404
has the least valid argument?

12:25.439 --> 12:26.539
That's convenient.

12:26.573 --> 12:28.274
Britta, how many people

12:28.308 --> 12:30.209
have you fed this year
besides yourself?

12:30.244 --> 12:31.310
- Oh, Janet...
- No, look.

12:31.345 --> 12:35.214
I've spent enough time feeling bad.

12:37.351 --> 12:38.517
Fight the power!

12:51.832 --> 12:54.233
- Would you like to go...
- Yeah.

12:54.268 --> 12:55.568
Yeah?

12:55.602 --> 12:58.437
Oh, my God.

13:10.851 --> 13:12.084
These are really good.

13:12.119 --> 13:15.521
It helps me to see
why you were so upset.

13:15.556 --> 13:17.256
Did I ruin anything
as good as what's in here?

13:17.291 --> 13:19.258
Ah, just practice drawings.

13:19.293 --> 13:21.994
I have to practice drawing
the duck from different angles.

13:22.029 --> 13:24.931
It's hard when his back's
turned 3/4 because of the beak.

13:24.965 --> 13:27.033
Well...

13:27.067 --> 13:29.135
I'm a real jerk for wrecking it.

13:29.169 --> 13:30.603
Ah, you didn't do it on purpose.

13:30.637 --> 13:31.704
That doesn't excuse my behavior.

13:31.738 --> 13:33.039
No, I appreciate that.

13:33.073 --> 13:37.343
It's a good apology.
You're a good kid.

13:37.377 --> 13:41.113
All right. Well...

13:41.148 --> 13:43.149
I can see from the clock that
if I hit all the green lights...

13:43.183 --> 13:44.317
I'm sorry, I can't let you go.

13:44.351 --> 13:46.018
That'd undercut the larger lesson.

13:46.053 --> 13:47.887
Yes, the lesson being
that you're very talented.

13:47.921 --> 13:49.921
But I have this thing.
I can't walk into a movie...

13:49.923 --> 13:52.592
You're not going to the movie.

13:54.161 --> 13:55.595
Yes, I am.

13:55.629 --> 13:57.597
- You need this.
- Let me go!

13:57.631 --> 13:59.765
This is you learning.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.434
You're a bad person
and a bad cartoonist.

14:01.468 --> 14:03.803
You go ahead. Hurt my feelings.

14:03.837 --> 14:05.538
Oh! You have feelings, huh?

14:05.572 --> 14:06.872
Have you considered
putting them into your work?

14:06.907 --> 14:09.242
Your cartoons are monuments
to joylessness,

14:09.276 --> 14:10.877
nervously assembled jokes
based on nothing from your life

14:10.911 --> 14:12.044
or anyone's life!

14:12.079 --> 14:14.747
You're furious at me for being creative
because you want to be able to create.

14:14.781 --> 14:16.749
You have all this rage
and shame and loneliness,

14:16.783 --> 14:18.351
which I don't even know how
to feel much less understand,

14:18.385 --> 14:19.719
and you decide to put what on paper?

14:19.753 --> 14:21.954
A duck. Jim the Duck.
You think I'm crazy.

14:21.989 --> 14:23.122
You think there's something
wrong with me.

14:23.156 --> 14:24.156
Jim the Duck?

14:24.157 --> 14:25.625
Publishers are interested!

14:25.659 --> 14:26.859
Oh! Yeah, well, publishers are stupid.

14:26.894 --> 14:29.241
Either that or you're misinterpreting
what was probably a form letter.

14:29.263 --> 14:30.384
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

14:30.397 --> 14:31.597
- Now you shut up.
- You shut up.

14:31.632 --> 14:32.765
Oh, are we yelling?
Are we yelling right now?

14:32.799 --> 14:34.233
Yelling! I'm yelling!

14:34.268 --> 14:36.035
Yelling! I'm yelling,
I'm yelling, I'm yelling!

14:36.069 --> 14:40.072
And you're not talented!
You made me miss my movie!

14:41.742 --> 14:44.176
You made me miss my movie.

14:56.623 --> 15:00.760
In the words of your
hacky duck, "What the hell?"

15:06.221 --> 15:08.021
Do you like music?

15:08.055 --> 15:09.335
Everyone likes music.

15:09.357 --> 15:11.391
What are you, a fish?

15:11.425 --> 15:14.561
I have... Ooh, I-I tell you
what we could listen to.

15:14.595 --> 15:17.430
Do you know Rimples and Splikket?

15:17.465 --> 15:19.499
They were the British
Laurel and Hardy.

15:22.236 --> 15:25.038
Most of their stuff is timeless,
but you do need to know

15:25.072 --> 15:27.007
that the prime minister
went to Oxford,

15:27.041 --> 15:30.310
not Cambridge,
as the sketch implies.

15:30.344 --> 15:31.778
Are they speaking English?

15:31.812 --> 15:35.782
Okay. '80s German techno it is.

15:35.816 --> 15:38.518
Do you have any friends?

15:38.553 --> 15:39.719
I'm sorry?

15:39.754 --> 15:41.955
I've been defining myself
with reactions

15:41.989 --> 15:44.291
to and from other people
my whole life.

15:44.325 --> 15:47.193
Now I feel worthless
just because I'm worthless

15:47.228 --> 15:48.595
in relation to my friends,

15:48.629 --> 15:51.064
which means they're not my friends.

15:51.098 --> 15:52.532
Who are your friends?

15:52.567 --> 15:54.134
Well, there's my neighbor, Pat.

15:54.168 --> 15:56.403
I try to stay on his good side.
I owe him money.

15:56.437 --> 15:58.805
Uh, Jeff. I'd call you a friend.

15:58.839 --> 16:00.039
Well, in fact, I'd call you a...

16:00.041 --> 16:01.274
Oh, that's right.

16:01.309 --> 16:04.611
You and Jeff have actually known each other
longer than anybody, huh?

16:04.645 --> 16:06.012
I always forget that.

16:06.047 --> 16:09.950
I guess 'cause you guys
don't really act like friends.

16:11.085 --> 16:14.988
Yeah, I guess not so much.

16:15.022 --> 16:17.958
Where are we going?

16:19.560 --> 16:24.731
Well, I think you should go home

16:24.765 --> 16:28.001
because you're having
an existential crisis,

16:28.035 --> 16:30.670
and the best lesson
you could take away from it

16:30.705 --> 16:34.274
is that you are someone,
even when you're by yourself.

16:34.308 --> 16:36.109
I think you're right. Thank you.

16:36.143 --> 16:38.645
And please don't take offense at this,

16:38.679 --> 16:40.246
but thank you for not hitting on me.

16:40.281 --> 16:43.650
I was just vulnerable enough
to do something really stupid.

16:45.753 --> 16:47.187
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing.

16:47.221 --> 16:48.355
It's nothing.

16:48.389 --> 16:50.056
It's the...
the stupid steering wheel

16:50.091 --> 16:52.325
is on the wrong side of the car.

16:57.062 --> 16:59.343
- What are you doing here?
- I want to show you something.

17:03.971 --> 17:05.906
What's this?

17:05.940 --> 17:08.141
It's a script I wrote
about a cop on the edge.

17:08.175 --> 17:10.644
Troy thought it was hilarious.

17:10.678 --> 17:12.444
I didn't have the heart
to tell him it wasn't a comedy.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.680
Why are you giving this to me?

17:13.714 --> 17:15.448
I know all the tricks
and tropes of filmmaking,

17:15.483 --> 17:18.585
but what I'm missing is what I think
the critics call "substance,"

17:18.618 --> 17:20.353
which is you more than me.

17:20.387 --> 17:23.857
You want to be film partners?

17:29.430 --> 17:32.499
"It's time for Justice.
Police Justice."

17:32.533 --> 17:36.102
Wait, the character's name
is "Police Justice"?

17:36.137 --> 17:37.137
Mm-hmm.

17:37.171 --> 17:39.339
Yeah, I think I may be able to help.

17:39.373 --> 17:42.309
I'm sorry for the stuff I said.

17:44.478 --> 17:46.513
Me too.

17:46.547 --> 17:48.748
Sit down.

17:53.521 --> 17:54.721
You drink scotch?

17:54.755 --> 17:56.656
- No.
- You're gonna.

17:58.793 --> 18:02.295
Hey, handsome. This stool taken?

18:02.330 --> 18:03.330
Struck out, huh?

18:03.331 --> 18:05.365
If that makes you feel better.

18:05.399 --> 18:10.003
Or maybe I just realized that
I was spending the whole night

18:10.037 --> 18:13.607
getting to third base
with the wrong person.

18:13.641 --> 18:15.976
You're a good friend,

18:16.010 --> 18:18.078
and I don't say that often enough.

18:18.112 --> 18:19.779
That's really nice.

18:19.814 --> 18:21.214
But you can't have sex with me.

18:21.249 --> 18:23.750
How about we have these drinks

18:23.784 --> 18:27.921
and then not have sex,
with anyone, together?

18:27.955 --> 18:29.856
Sounds good.

18:29.890 --> 18:31.825
Cheers.

18:31.859 --> 18:34.179
So a 9-millimeter's actually
better than a 10-millimeter?

18:34.195 --> 18:35.762
Millimeter don't make no difference.

18:35.796 --> 18:37.597
Bullets just kinda kill you.

18:37.632 --> 18:39.065
"Bullets just kinda kill you."

18:39.100 --> 18:40.834
Are you quoting something?
Can I use that?

18:40.868 --> 18:41.868
Yeah.

18:41.869 --> 18:44.037
You left your handkerchief
at my place last night.

18:44.071 --> 18:45.639
- Ah!
- We had a boys' night.

18:45.673 --> 18:48.408
A bottle of booze,
an argument about sports cars.

18:48.442 --> 18:51.478
And I cut my hand trying
to prove that I can whittle.

18:51.512 --> 18:54.047
Me too.

18:54.081 --> 18:55.515
Oh, hey.

18:55.549 --> 18:56.750
- How was your night?
- Great.

18:56.784 --> 19:00.186
I had a monumental evening...
by myself.

19:00.221 --> 19:02.923
- Oh!
- Oh... Almost feel left out.

19:02.957 --> 19:05.058
Well, we've had our share
of focus lately.

19:05.092 --> 19:07.661
Mm-hmm. Speak for yourself.

19:07.695 --> 19:09.195
Uh-oh.

19:09.230 --> 19:12.465
I'm fine. I just, um...

19:12.500 --> 19:15.168
Do you guys believe in ghosts?

19:15.202 --> 19:17.237
And if you do, do you believe

19:17.271 --> 19:19.873
what those ghosts tell you
about other ghosts?

19:19.907 --> 19:22.075
Chang, you cannot
be on the committee

19:22.109 --> 19:24.311
if you're going
to be actively insane.

19:24.345 --> 19:28.014
I'm not insane. I swear.
I just, um...

19:28.049 --> 19:30.684
had a weird experience
at the theater last night.

19:30.718 --> 19:32.218
- You were there?
- Yeah, you were there?

19:32.253 --> 19:33.520
What do you mean?
Of course I was.

19:33.554 --> 19:36.423
Huh, I guess we just didn't see you.

19:37.458 --> 19:39.693
Well, the ants were people.

19:39.727 --> 19:42.162
The Queen Ant was an oil company.

19:45.299 --> 19:47.500
What if I don't exist?

19:47.535 --> 19:48.835
Oh, I got this.

19:48.870 --> 19:51.438
I had a very similar night
last night.

19:51.472 --> 19:54.541
Go home, light some candles,
and take a bath.

19:54.575 --> 19:56.543
Okay, coolsies.

20:17.475 --> 20:20.205
__

20:23.077 --> 20:25.946
Hey!
I was thinking off-campus lunch.

20:25.980 --> 20:27.447
What's that Tex-Mex place
you mentioned?

20:27.482 --> 20:29.950
Salsa Von Taco's?
Read my mind!

20:29.984 --> 20:33.387
Oh. Oh!

20:33.421 --> 20:35.555
- No, no.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

20:35.590 --> 20:36.990
No, no, no, no, no.

20:37.025 --> 20:38.759
- Nah.
- Oh, okay. Yeah.

20:38.793 --> 20:40.727
- Oh.
- No, wha... Let's...

20:40.762 --> 20:42.062
- No.
- No, no, no.

20:42.096 --> 20:43.263
- Well... O-okay.
- Ah...

20:43.297 --> 20:44.297
- You... you just...
- Eh...

20:44.298 --> 20:45.298
- Ah. Oh, okay.
- Ah...

20:45.299 --> 20:46.466

I-I just don't like being left behind!

20:48.469 --> 20:51.238
My father got drunk in pubs
and left me in my room with nothing!

20:51.272 --> 20:54.141
- So did mine!
- Oh, why would he do that?

20:54.175 --> 20:55.575
Why do they do that?

20:55.610 --> 20:58.779
- Why?
- Why do they do that?

21:00.148 --> 21:02.716
I-I won't go to that Tex-Mex place.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.852

21:04.865 --> 21:06.135
- Hmm?
- Hmm?
