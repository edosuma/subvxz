00:02.126 --> 00:03.727
I need you to find out
what kind of relationship

00:03.795 --> 00:06.195
- Jake Ballard has with Olivia Pope.
- Consider it done.

00:06.196 --> 00:07.297
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:07.298 --> 00:08.263
You are a liar!

00:08.264 --> 00:09.999
You wanted to know who I am?
This is who I am.

00:10.066 --> 00:11.566
Defiance is who I am.

00:11.634 --> 00:13.369
I'm moving across the
street into Blair house.

00:13.436 --> 00:14.335
Don't worry.
We'll take the tunnels.

00:14.404 --> 00:16.370
No one will see us. No one even
needs to know what's happening.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.406
- Do you still love me?
- I do.

00:18.474 --> 00:19.907
But I can't do this anymore.

00:19.975 --> 00:21.642
(Door slams)

00:21.710 --> 00:24.578
(Water lapping)

00:37.158 --> 00:39.626
(Water splashes) (Exhales)

00:39.693 --> 00:43.163
Well...someone
went to summer camp.

00:43.231 --> 00:45.565
(Water splashes)

00:50.437 --> 00:52.338
There are laws
against stalking.

00:52.406 --> 00:54.606
- I am here to protect you.
- From who? You?

00:54.674 --> 00:56.775
Because <i>you're</i> the one who
has been secretly filming me.

00:56.843 --> 00:57.811
Someone broke into your apartment...

00:57.878 --> 00:59.078
You're the one that
put me in the hospital.

00:59.079 --> 00:59.579
- With the intention of killing you.

00:59.646 --> 01:00.646
If I need protection
from anyone, it's you!

01:00.647 --> 01:02.047
I understand that you
may not want to see me,

01:02.114 --> 01:04.315
but I cannot leave your sight.
I am here on orders.

01:04.382 --> 01:06.784
- Orders? - Military orders.
I am a naval officer.

01:06.852 --> 01:09.620
The President of the United
States is my commander-in-chief,

01:09.688 --> 01:11.722
and he has ordered me to
ensure your safety. (Laughs)

01:11.790 --> 01:13.858
Were I to disobey his orders,
I would face...

01:13.926 --> 01:15.326
(Dialing)
Court-martial and jail...

01:15.394 --> 01:16.794
- Mm-hmm. - And possibly charges
of treason as well.

01:16.862 --> 01:18.795
This is Olivia Pope
calling for the President.

01:18.863 --> 01:21.865
Yes.
Thank you!

01:21.933 --> 01:24.601
- Good morning, Olivia.
- Call off your puppy.

01:24.669 --> 01:26.103
(Scoffs) I'd take pit bull
or rottweiler,

01:26.171 --> 01:27.538
but puppy?
Come on, that's low.

01:27.605 --> 01:29.540
- No.
- No?

01:29.607 --> 01:31.475
No. I want you safe.
(Closes door)

01:31.543 --> 01:33.544
Your having me tailed
by one of your boys

01:33.611 --> 01:35.078
isn't going to help
with you and me.

01:35.145 --> 01:37.046
- You get that, right?
- Mellie moved out.

01:37.114 --> 01:39.315
She's living at Blair house.

01:39.383 --> 01:40.950
I want Jake Ballard gone!

01:41.017 --> 01:42.952
You don't want to talk about the
fact that my wife moved out

01:43.019 --> 01:44.420
and I'm alone
at the White House?

01:44.488 --> 01:46.489
No, I don't, because that
has nothing to do with me.

01:46.557 --> 01:48.191
Then I don't want to talk about
Jake Ballard.

01:48.259 --> 01:50.525
You cannot have me followed
everywhere I go.

01:50.593 --> 01:51.893
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

01:51.961 --> 01:53.761
- Yes, I can.
- No, you ca... You know what?

01:53.829 --> 01:55.930
This conversation is over. Good-bye.
(Chuckles) (Cell phone beeps)

01:55.998 --> 01:58.100
(Sets phone down)
(Cell phone rings)

01:58.167 --> 01:59.401
(Sighs softly)

01:59.469 --> 02:00.868
(Cell phone beeps) Yes, sir?

02:00.936 --> 02:02.204
Yes.

02:02.271 --> 02:03.271
Yes, sir.

02:03.339 --> 02:05.607
Of course, sir.

02:05.674 --> 02:07.809
I don't think
that'll be necessary, sir.

02:09.176 --> 02:10.544
Well, yes.

02:10.613 --> 02:13.014
Yes, sir.
I will keep you informed.

02:13.082 --> 02:15.382
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:15.450 --> 02:17.251
(Cell phone beeps)

02:17.319 --> 02:19.353
- Well?
- Well, what?

02:19.421 --> 02:20.256
What did he say?

02:20.323 --> 02:21.823
He said that if you don't
let me protect you,

02:21.824 --> 02:23.390
he will have
the U.S. attorney obtain

02:23.458 --> 02:24.425
a material witness warrant

02:24.492 --> 02:26.026
and have you taken into
custody and put in a cell,

02:26.094 --> 02:27.828
- where you will be safe from harm.
- Ugh!

02:27.895 --> 02:29.963
(Sighs)

02:30.031 --> 02:31.699
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

02:31.767 --> 02:34.835
sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

02:34.902 --> 02:37.604
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

02:37.672 --> 02:39.304
We need to put out
a blanket statement

02:39.372 --> 02:41.206
that Teddy's come down
with chicken pox

02:41.274 --> 02:43.542
- and the President has never
been exposed. - He hasn't?

02:43.610 --> 02:45.144
I don't know!
Just say it!

02:45.211 --> 02:47.079
And that's why the First
Lady is at Blair house.

02:47.147 --> 02:48.714
She's nursing her baby son
back from the brink

02:48.782 --> 02:51.117
of an infectious disease
with her own two hands.

02:51.184 --> 02:52.551
(Sighs) (Sets papers down)

02:52.619 --> 02:54.353
Wh-why are you here?

02:54.420 --> 02:56.021
Because something amazing
has happened.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.656
That's wonderful, James.

02:57.723 --> 03:00.324
Can we move the N.A.A.C.P.
luncheon to next week?

03:00.392 --> 03:02.894
Hopefully Mellie will be
able to make it by then.

03:02.962 --> 03:05.163
I think so, if we push the
future farmers of America.

03:05.230 --> 03:06.831
- Cyrus, you're not listening to me!
- I'm listening.

03:06.899 --> 03:08.599
That's amazing.
Push it.

03:08.668 --> 03:10.734
(Phone ringing) BNC offered me a job...
Out of the blue.

03:10.802 --> 03:12.102
They want me to be
on-air talent.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.337
On the air.
On the airwaves!

03:14.405 --> 03:16.774
On television! Me!
And I know we had a deal.

03:16.841 --> 03:18.208
I know I said I'd stay home
with the baby,

03:18.276 --> 03:20.044
and I have a line on a
highly overqualified nanny.

03:20.111 --> 03:21.945
(Phone ringing) And I'll be
home for bath time every day.

03:22.013 --> 03:23.513
I could be the next Anderson Cooper.
(Ringing continues)

03:23.581 --> 03:26.483
Because, come on, I <i>could</i> be
the next Anderson Cooper.

03:26.551 --> 03:28.284
(Ringing continues)
Don't you think? Cy?

03:28.351 --> 03:30.119
- Fine.
- Fine?

03:30.187 --> 03:32.755
Mr. Beene, that's Emily's list
calling for Mrs. Grant.

03:32.823 --> 03:34.356
(Ringing continues)
Fine, James. Fine.

03:34.424 --> 03:35.658
Go on tv.

03:35.726 --> 03:37.593
(Ring, receiver clatters)
Lillian!

03:37.661 --> 03:40.362
Surprise. It's me...
Cyrus Beene.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.031
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

03:42.032 --> 03:42.598
(Harrison) That's him.

03:42.599 --> 03:44.166
Baseball cap.
Same guy I saw at the hospital.

03:44.167 --> 03:44.933
(David) All I see is ear.

03:44.934 --> 03:46.835
He knew where the cameras were.
Never showed his face.

03:46.903 --> 03:48.704
Guy who gets to Huck
and works for albatross...

03:48.771 --> 03:49.838
No way he lets himself
get caught on camera.

03:49.839 --> 03:50.505
Maybe if we zoom in.

03:50.506 --> 03:51.673
(David) We can see how an ear works.
(Keys click)

03:51.741 --> 03:53.208
Is there another angle?
Another camera?

03:53.275 --> 03:54.542
A secret camera
we could hack into?

03:54.610 --> 03:56.011
I don't know.
I'm not Huck.

03:56.079 --> 03:57.545
I've been poring over
this stuff for two days...

03:57.613 --> 03:59.546
Every camera, every angle.
It's... this is all we've got.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.982
- An ear.
- Can I help?

04:04.853 --> 04:08.555
- Welcome back. - We were just looking
over the footage from that night.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.624
- We didn't want to bother you while
you were... - Shaking off the crazy.

04:10.692 --> 04:12.426
- It's true.
- Play it.

04:12.493 --> 04:14.061
(Taps key)

04:14.129 --> 04:15.494
That's Charlie.
(Taps key)

04:15.562 --> 04:17.495
- How do you know?
- That's his ear.

04:17.564 --> 04:19.332
(Sighs)

04:19.399 --> 04:21.666
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

04:21.736 --> 04:23.436
Please pass on my
regards to your wife.

04:23.503 --> 04:24.938
I will.
(Breathes deeply)

04:25.005 --> 04:26.940
(Lowered voice)
You need to talk to her.

04:27.007 --> 04:28.441
Saying she's quarantined
herself with Teddy

04:28.508 --> 04:29.809
buys us some time,
but not enough,

04:29.877 --> 04:30.909
not if she's going to
drag this out,

04:30.977 --> 04:32.310
and it seems that she is.

04:32.378 --> 04:33.912
She needs to be gone to
and pleaded with.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.214
- No.
- Sir...

04:35.281 --> 04:36.481
(Lowered voice) When a child
throws a tantrum,

04:36.549 --> 04:37.649
you don't indulge them.
You ignore them.

04:37.717 --> 04:38.951
You call their bluff.

04:39.018 --> 04:40.485
(Normal voice)
Welcome to the White House.

04:40.553 --> 04:41.887
(Lowered voice) I'm calling
Mellie's bluff, Cy.

04:41.955 --> 04:42.988
Believe me, she'll blink.

04:43.056 --> 04:45.224
(Normal voice) Mrs. Okur.

04:45.291 --> 04:47.258
(Speaking indistinctly)

04:53.932 --> 04:56.134
(Sighs) (Cyrus) I'm asking
you to be an adult!

04:56.201 --> 04:58.435
Stop holding your breath,
quit stomping your feet!

04:58.503 --> 05:00.004
It's time to pick up your
toys like a good girl

05:00.072 --> 05:02.073
and act like the First Lady
of the United States of America.

05:02.141 --> 05:03.907
I am the child?
I am not the one

05:03.975 --> 05:06.243
stealing the car to go
make out with my girlfriend.

05:06.310 --> 05:07.911
Because it's not working!
It's not going to work!

05:07.979 --> 05:09.479
He's not backing down on this.

05:09.546 --> 05:11.882
Neither am I.

05:11.949 --> 05:13.216
Rachel?
Can you come in for a minute?

05:15.519 --> 05:17.487
You called Gayle Hudson
at BNC, right?

05:17.554 --> 05:20.289
Yes, ma'am. Then we're all set up
for tomorrow night, prime time?

05:20.356 --> 05:22.024
Thank you, Rachel.
(Exhales)

05:22.092 --> 05:24.359
Tell Fitz he has 36 hours
to convince me,

05:24.427 --> 05:25.761
in person, that he regrets

05:25.829 --> 05:27.062
the unfortunate choices
he's made

05:27.130 --> 05:28.363
and truly wants
to recommit himself

05:28.431 --> 05:29.765
to his wife and children.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.233
If he doesn't, he will
have the pleasure

05:31.301 --> 05:32.935
of seeing the First Lady
of the United States

05:33.003 --> 05:36.604
call her husband a whore-loving
bastard on national television.

05:36.672 --> 05:37.806
You wouldn't.

05:37.873 --> 05:40.374
Call my bluff, Cy.
I dare you.

05:44.079 --> 05:45.746
36 hours, Cy.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.884
(Elevator bell dings)

05:51.853 --> 05:54.288
I've never seen where you work.
It's nice.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.989
- Lots of character.
- Stay out of my way,

05:56.057 --> 05:58.091
out of my business,
and out of my office!

05:58.159 --> 06:00.393
(Sighs) (Cell phone rings)

06:00.461 --> 06:02.462
Yes, Cyrus?

06:02.530 --> 06:03.964
How involved are you
with Fitz right now?

06:04.032 --> 06:05.899
Excuse me?
Have you seen him?

06:05.967 --> 06:07.633
Are you seeing him?
Do you plan to see him?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.168
Or are you just doing
the heavy breathing

06:09.236 --> 06:10.736
phone routine these days?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.872
Cyrus... Mellie's not
playing this time, Liv.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.173
She's at Blair house.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.774
She packed her bags
and she's left.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.776
She's going to announce
to the world

06:17.845 --> 06:19.778
that her somewhat
high-profile husband

06:19.847 --> 06:21.480
is, in fact,
a philandering cad.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.348
And for some reason, I seem
to be the only one around here

06:23.415 --> 06:25.750
taking her threat seriously.
I'm done with him, Cy.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.152
<i>Done</i> done
or heavy phone breathing done?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.321
Done. I'm not gonna
meddle in his life,

06:29.388 --> 06:31.923
and I'm certainly not going to meddle
in his marriage. (Cell phone beeps)

06:31.991 --> 06:33.058
(Exhales)

06:34.293 --> 06:35.727
(Whispering) Shh.

06:35.794 --> 06:37.495
What?

06:37.563 --> 06:38.963
(Door closes) What are you
all whispering about?

06:39.030 --> 06:40.264
- We weren't whispering.
- You were.

06:40.332 --> 06:42.199
You were huddled
and whispering.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.168
What... (Laughs)

06:44.236 --> 06:46.536
Someone speak.

06:46.604 --> 06:47.905
Please.

06:52.344 --> 06:55.511
I will stand here all
day if I have to.

06:55.579 --> 06:58.014
(Sighs)

06:58.082 --> 07:00.149
Huck looked into
surveillance footage

07:00.217 --> 07:02.685
and I.D.'d the guy.

07:02.753 --> 07:04.320
It was Charlie.

07:04.388 --> 07:06.756
My Charlie.
Cyrus' Charlie.

07:06.823 --> 07:09.458
He attacked me.
And he broke into your apartment.

07:09.526 --> 07:11.494
- You're suggesting... - We think
Cyrus Beene may be the mole.

07:27.679 --> 07:29.680
(Button clicks)

07:29.748 --> 07:33.750
(Breathes deeply)

07:33.817 --> 07:35.718
(Beep)

07:35.786 --> 07:37.387
Chief?

07:37.454 --> 07:39.021
I think I've got
all the proof we need.

07:39.089 --> 07:40.356
(Cyrus) Hold on to it.

07:40.424 --> 07:42.024
I don't want to use it
unless we have to.

07:42.092 --> 07:43.793
(Beep) (Sighs)

07:46.830 --> 07:48.330
Are you sure
it was Charlie, Huck?

07:48.398 --> 07:49.464
He knew what that box
would do to me.

07:49.532 --> 07:50.866
He's seen it firsthand.

07:50.933 --> 07:51.766
So I'm supposed to believe
that the man

07:51.834 --> 07:52.668
who broke into my apartment,

07:52.735 --> 07:54.302
a man who was presumably
there to kill me...

07:54.370 --> 07:55.670
Was sent there by your buddy.

07:55.738 --> 07:57.472
He's one of the few people
in Washington

07:57.540 --> 07:59.841
who has access to the files that
we found on Wendy's hard drive.

07:59.909 --> 08:01.410
It explains why he got
so mad when you told him

08:01.477 --> 08:02.311
Osborne was framed.

08:02.378 --> 08:04.978
And why he refused to pass
the info to the President.

08:05.146 --> 08:06.480
Does Charlie have
other clients?

08:06.548 --> 08:08.849
Clients who access to those
kinds of files? I doubt it.

08:08.917 --> 08:11.151
Find out. This is one
of my best friends.

08:11.219 --> 08:12.420
(Harrison scoffs)
I've known him since...

08:12.487 --> 08:14.121
I have known him a long time!

08:14.188 --> 08:16.256
If I'm going to accuse him
of betraying his country,

08:16.324 --> 08:18.426
of being the mole,
of being Albatross,

08:18.493 --> 08:19.927
I want to be sure,
I <i>have</i> to be sure,

08:19.994 --> 08:21.461
and so do you,

08:21.529 --> 08:23.463
especially considering the
last man we wrongly accused

08:23.531 --> 08:24.831
ended up dead.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.501
(Sighs)

08:28.569 --> 08:31.971
This is, uh, Charlie.
He's a... uh...

08:32.039 --> 08:33.172
Let's just start with
Charlie's last name.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.506
Charlie's not his real name.

08:34.575 --> 08:36.207
Was he on file at the FBI, the CIA?

08:36.275 --> 08:37.543
Maybe we can link his alias...

08:37.610 --> 08:39.277
No, that's won't...
He's too good.

08:39.345 --> 08:42.179
- How well do you know him?
- Uh, well, and also not well.

08:42.248 --> 08:43.381
- Have you ever been to his place?
- Uh...

08:43.450 --> 08:45.016
(Drill whirring) A while ago.

08:45.084 --> 08:47.719
- Where?
- Uh, 20th and Biltmore.

08:47.787 --> 08:50.088
Sure. A nice fella.
Quiet. Paid on time.

08:50.156 --> 08:51.389
"Paid"?
So he's gone.

08:51.458 --> 08:52.957
Left a year ago, June.

08:53.024 --> 08:54.592
Did he pay via check
or wire transfer?

08:54.660 --> 08:56.393
Cashier's check,
first of the month.

08:56.462 --> 08:58.529
- What else do you know about Charlie?
- We just need the simple stuff...

08:58.597 --> 09:00.665
Baseball or football?
Vodka or bourbon?

09:00.732 --> 09:02.967
- What does he do? What does he like?
- He likes, uh, killing.

09:03.034 --> 09:05.369
Elevator!
Anything else, Huck?

09:05.437 --> 09:07.137
- He likes sugar.
- Sugar?

09:07.205 --> 09:08.939
Uh, sugar... pastries,
doughnuts,

09:09.006 --> 09:12.208
bear claws, Danish, those
cinnamon pull-apart things.

09:12.276 --> 09:13.643
Charlie the killer likes
breakfast pastries?

09:13.711 --> 09:14.778
All right,
we can work with that.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.580
Who's got the best pastries in town?

09:16.647 --> 09:18.014
You'll destroy evidence
without thinking twice

09:18.082 --> 09:19.950
but cutting in line is
outside your comfort zone?

09:20.017 --> 09:22.619
- It's no way to make friends.
- Why are we making friends?

09:22.687 --> 09:24.820
- Next! - (Sighs) I am so
excited to finally be here.

09:24.888 --> 09:27.356
My friend Charlie has been
raving about this place.

09:27.423 --> 09:28.991
Oh. I can't remember
what he orders, though.

09:29.058 --> 09:31.460
You... he told me not to
miss out on the... (Scoffs)

09:31.528 --> 09:34.630
Oh, shoot. Uh...
You know him, right?

09:34.698 --> 09:36.565
Oh, sure.
Comes in every Thursday about 6:00.

09:36.633 --> 09:39.368
- Two dozen cannoli.
- Cannoli it is. We'll take a dozen.

09:39.435 --> 09:41.302
Every Thursday.

09:41.370 --> 09:43.705
When you don't have a badge,
you gotta make friends.

09:43.772 --> 09:45.540
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

09:45.608 --> 09:47.074
So we'll just wait
till Thursday.

09:47.142 --> 09:48.843
He'll come back to the bakery.
That's three days away.

09:48.911 --> 09:51.412
Three more days for Charlie to
take another shot at your life.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.814
Or skip town,
if he hasn't already.

09:52.882 --> 09:54.716
Huck, any chance
we can trace his phone?

09:54.783 --> 09:56.150
No way.
He's too good, too careful.

09:56.218 --> 09:58.184
What if we had the phone
of someone who called Charlie?

09:58.252 --> 09:58.888
Would that help?

09:58.889 --> 10:01.655
Well, I could check
the records, look for patterns.

10:01.856 --> 10:02.657
Could help narrow locations.

10:02.658 --> 10:04.224
Because we all know one
person who called Charlie.

10:04.225 --> 10:06.226
- Probably a lot.
- On his personal cell phone.

10:06.293 --> 10:07.293
Which wouldn't be
heavily protected

10:07.361 --> 10:08.162
like his White House line.

10:08.163 --> 10:09.363
We're not hacking
into Cyrus' phone.

10:09.431 --> 10:10.797
It's a gross invasion
of privacy.

10:10.865 --> 10:11.632
And he's your best friend.

10:11.699 --> 10:13.566
Your best friend who maybe
betrayed his country

10:13.634 --> 10:14.634
and tried to kill you?

10:16.270 --> 10:17.737
Do it.

10:17.804 --> 10:20.806
(Typing)

10:20.874 --> 10:24.177
It's more than a tantrum, sir.
She's digging in.

10:24.245 --> 10:27.847
- Sir, I need you to focus on this.
- I'm running a country.

10:27.915 --> 10:29.581
You won't be running a country
if you don't do something

10:29.649 --> 10:31.783
about the incoming nuclear
winter that is your wife.

10:31.851 --> 10:33.718
- Cyrus...
- Humor me. Humor me.

10:33.786 --> 10:35.519
Save an old man
with high blood pressure

10:35.587 --> 10:37.222
from an unnecessary stroke.

10:37.289 --> 10:40.024
Mellie graduated top of
our class in law school.

10:40.092 --> 10:42.193
She is brilliant.
She is focused.

10:42.261 --> 10:43.828
She is logical.

10:43.896 --> 10:46.230
- Above all, she's ambitious.
- Sir.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.232
Whet her appetite.

10:48.299 --> 10:50.234
Take our your magic ball

10:50.301 --> 10:52.102
and show her her
bright, bright future.

10:52.170 --> 10:55.239
Okay. (Sighs)

10:55.306 --> 10:57.007
Cyrus.

10:57.075 --> 10:58.742
Mellie's also stubborn.
When I was a young man,

10:58.810 --> 11:00.277
I thought of owning
a bookstore.

11:00.344 --> 11:04.113
Explain the concept of mutual
assured destruction to her.

11:07.684 --> 11:09.852
(Door opens)

11:09.920 --> 11:11.020
(Door closes)

11:11.088 --> 11:13.256
(Exhales)

11:17.359 --> 11:19.261
(Receiver clatters)

11:19.328 --> 11:21.330
(Ring, beep) What?

11:21.398 --> 11:22.332
I need to see you.

11:24.200 --> 11:24.600
No.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.934
Come here to the White
House right now.

11:26.002 --> 11:27.336
- No.
- Fine.

11:27.404 --> 11:28.971
- I'll come to you.
- What?

11:29.038 --> 11:30.872
It's rush hour, but depending
on how long it takes

11:30.940 --> 11:32.373
Tom and Hal to pull
the car around,

11:32.441 --> 11:33.674
I could be in your office
in ten minutes.

11:33.742 --> 11:35.176
Are all of your people
still there?

11:35.244 --> 11:38.713
Tell them to stick around.
I'd love to say hello.

11:38.780 --> 11:40.648
You know I'm supposed
to be in uniform

11:40.716 --> 11:42.217
when I go to the White House.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.952
You're trying to get me
in trouble, aren't you?

11:45.020 --> 11:46.187
(Olivia sighs) Miss Pope.

11:46.255 --> 11:47.655
- Is he in there?
- Yes, but...

11:47.723 --> 11:49.289
- Is he alone?
- I'll tell him you're here.

11:49.357 --> 11:50.857
Ma'am.
(Sighs)

11:50.925 --> 11:53.293
- Good job.
(Fitz) - It's okay, Daniel.

11:56.864 --> 11:58.132
What?!

12:01.369 --> 12:03.770
(Breathes unevenly)

12:14.653 --> 12:16.220
Why don't you have a seat?

12:16.288 --> 12:17.988
- What do you want?
- Sit down.

12:18.056 --> 12:20.157
- No.
- Sit down, Olivia.

12:20.225 --> 12:23.160
I am busy. I have a job.
I have people who count on me.

12:23.228 --> 12:25.062
I don't have time to come
running down to the White House

12:25.130 --> 12:26.530
at your beck and call

12:26.598 --> 12:28.332
like you're the only one
who's important.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.735
- Sitting down is not happening,
so <i>what</i> do you want? - You.

12:31.803 --> 12:33.736
- (Sighs) Good-bye, Mr. President.
- Oh, come on!

12:33.804 --> 12:35.871
You do not summon me!

12:35.939 --> 12:38.308
You do not walk away from me!

12:38.375 --> 12:40.610
(Sighs)

12:49.486 --> 12:50.885
(Breathing unevenly) I'm done.

12:50.953 --> 12:52.887
I told you I was done.
We're over.

12:52.955 --> 12:55.224
We're not over. We're not ever...
(Exhales sharply)

12:55.291 --> 12:57.825
gonna be over. I am never
going to be over you.

12:57.892 --> 13:01.795
Your wife is at Blair house,
and she is about to explode.

13:01.863 --> 13:03.731
Your political career...
You'll never get re-elected

13:03.798 --> 13:05.333
if you don't get her back.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.900
Your time as President
will be over,

13:06.968 --> 13:08.902
and you're worried about
getting your mistress back?!

13:08.970 --> 13:10.438
How many times

13:10.506 --> 13:12.439
do I need to tell you that
you're more than that?

13:12.507 --> 13:15.642
Come back to me.
Forgive me.

13:15.709 --> 13:17.277
- I love you.
- Please stop.

13:17.345 --> 13:19.879
<i>Please</i> stop
getting my hopes up.

13:19.947 --> 13:22.115
- Just stop!
- I can't stop. I won't.

13:22.183 --> 13:23.250
(Sighs) Olivia.

13:23.317 --> 13:25.852
I am not a toy
you can play with

13:25.919 --> 13:28.320
when you're bored or lonely or horny!

13:28.388 --> 13:30.456
I am <i>not</i> the girl the guy
gets at the end of the movie!

13:30.524 --> 13:32.758
I am not a fantasy!

13:32.825 --> 13:34.860
If you want me, earn me!

13:34.927 --> 13:36.928
Until then, we are done.

13:43.836 --> 13:45.903
(Door slams)

13:45.971 --> 13:47.539
That sounded heavy.
Not that I could hear

13:47.606 --> 13:49.106
what you were saying exactly,

13:49.175 --> 13:51.176
but I don't think I've ever
heard anyone raise their voice

13:51.243 --> 13:52.510
to the President of the
United States before,

13:52.578 --> 13:54.412
- so whatever it was...
- Leave me alone.

13:56.682 --> 13:57.449
Olivia, what's wrong?

13:57.517 --> 14:00.884
I need a second alone.
I just... please.

14:00.951 --> 14:02.619
(Indistinct conversations)

14:02.687 --> 14:04.888
Okay.

14:04.955 --> 14:07.757
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

14:07.825 --> 14:09.025
(Breathes unevenly)

14:12.997 --> 14:15.065
(Sighs)

14:17.568 --> 14:19.302
(Exhales)

14:28.278 --> 14:29.378
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

14:29.446 --> 14:31.146
You come back,
continue your duties

14:31.215 --> 14:32.514
as First Lady and
support the President

14:32.582 --> 14:34.115
through the re-election campaign,

14:34.183 --> 14:37.151
and then you get
an issue all to yourself.

14:37.220 --> 14:39.254
A big one... immigration,
gun violence.

14:39.322 --> 14:41.523
You name it.
You take that issue.

14:41.591 --> 14:44.226
Own that issue,
and pass a bill.

14:44.293 --> 14:47.095
And in your final year
as First Lady,

14:47.162 --> 14:48.696
we launch your career

14:48.763 --> 14:50.664
with the full support
of a successful President

14:50.732 --> 14:53.534
and the backing of his
vast political machine.

14:53.602 --> 14:56.136
With that kind of profile,
that level of success,

14:56.204 --> 14:58.672
you'd win a senate seat
in a landslide.

14:58.740 --> 15:01.575
But I'd consider governor
of California, if I were you.

15:01.643 --> 15:03.410
Better springboard
to the White House.

15:03.478 --> 15:05.478
To run as an outsider
who knows the ropes,

15:05.546 --> 15:08.214
who's handled big issues
in a big state.

15:11.752 --> 15:13.419
(Rustles papers) It's not enough.
It's not what I asked for.

15:13.487 --> 15:15.154
Take this deal.

15:15.222 --> 15:16.422
Or else...

15:16.490 --> 15:18.124
Or else what?

15:18.191 --> 15:19.859
Flip the page.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.765
It's blank.

15:25.832 --> 15:28.333
'Cause that's how much
political capital you'll have.

15:28.401 --> 15:30.669
- Oh... - After the whisper campaign
we'll start within the party

15:30.737 --> 15:33.038
about how you were complicit
with the President's affair,

15:33.106 --> 15:35.641
about how you were frigid
and a closeted lesbian,

15:35.708 --> 15:36.875
about how you tore
the President down

15:36.942 --> 15:38.442
for your own political gain.

15:38.510 --> 15:40.478
It'll be dirty and false
and relentless.

15:40.545 --> 15:41.980
And by the time we're done,
the pac money

15:42.047 --> 15:43.581
will slow to a trickle,
and you won't have

15:43.649 --> 15:46.517
so much as a frenemy
left inside the beltway.

15:49.989 --> 15:52.223
(Exhales)

15:54.993 --> 15:58.896
Olivia Pope just left
my husband's office.

15:58.963 --> 16:01.131
(Chuckles softly)

16:01.199 --> 16:03.301
I have as many friends
over there as you do.

16:06.605 --> 16:08.673
I want what I asked for.

16:10.274 --> 16:11.775
Nothing less.

16:15.813 --> 16:18.080
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

16:19.583 --> 16:22.686
Anything else tonight, sir?

16:23.921 --> 16:25.922
Mr. Beene?

16:25.989 --> 16:29.558
I'd stay, but it's my
granddaughter's piano recital.

16:29.626 --> 16:31.027
Remember?

16:31.094 --> 16:32.661
I'll ask one of the other secretaries

16:32.729 --> 16:34.230
to look in on you,
see if you want dinner.

16:36.700 --> 16:38.835
You've gotten through worse.

16:59.054 --> 17:00.354
Huck?

17:00.421 --> 17:02.422
(Exhales)
I have to talk to you.

17:02.490 --> 17:03.590
Okay.

17:07.362 --> 17:08.762
(Door closes) Uh...

17:10.098 --> 17:12.398
Charlie k-killed
Amanda Tanner.

17:14.068 --> 17:15.902
(Whispers) What?

17:15.970 --> 17:17.270
Charlie killed Amanda Tanner.

17:19.173 --> 17:21.674
You've known that for quite
some time, haven't you, Huck?

17:21.742 --> 17:23.476
Yeah, pretty much
since it happened.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.244
I didn't say anything
because, uh,

17:25.311 --> 17:27.413
there's a code.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.015
Okay.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.449
What I didn't know
until I went back through

17:30.517 --> 17:32.418
the phone logs was
who ordered him to do it.

17:33.754 --> 17:35.488
Cyrus?

17:35.555 --> 17:38.123
Charlie's been his guy for
at least the last two years.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.959
So why are you telling me this?

17:41.027 --> 17:42.795
Because the last woman

17:42.863 --> 17:44.430
that was sleeping
with the President

17:44.498 --> 17:47.366
ended up dead in the Potomac.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.601
And I want you to stay alive.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.349
What if I could get rid
of Olivia Pope?

18:19.601 --> 18:20.433
(Elevator bell dings)

18:20.501 --> 18:21.668
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

18:21.736 --> 18:22.869
You haven't snapped at me
for six blocks.

18:22.937 --> 18:25.238
Something is wrong.

18:25.306 --> 18:27.040
You know,
this isn't my day job.

18:27.108 --> 18:28.842
So you have to wonder
why the President

18:28.910 --> 18:30.276
of the United States, who has the
secret service... (Keys jangling)

18:30.344 --> 18:33.345
the FBI, and the entire
armed forces at his disposal,

18:33.413 --> 18:34.914
chose me to protect you.
(Key turns in lock)

18:34.982 --> 18:36.816
It's because despite
your deep denial,

18:36.883 --> 18:38.350
you're actually in danger.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.953
No. It's because
you're his Navy buddy.

18:41.021 --> 18:42.755
So when there's a congressional
hearing about this...

18:42.823 --> 18:44.389
the illegal surveillance,
the stalking...

18:44.457 --> 18:48.459
he knows you'll lie for him.
Good night, Jake.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.028
(Door closes)

18:50.096 --> 18:52.296
(Cell phone rings)

18:52.364 --> 18:53.832
(Ring)

18:53.899 --> 18:55.634
(Beep)

18:55.701 --> 18:56.968
Mr. President.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.336
It's actually Lauren,
Captain Ballard.

18:58.403 --> 18:59.971
The President needs
to see you...

19:00.039 --> 19:01.572
Here at the White House
immediately.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.873
Does he want me to bring miss Pope?

19:02.941 --> 19:04.474
No, sir.
He just requested you.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.276
The President wants me
to leave my post?

19:06.344 --> 19:07.611
He said it won't take long,

19:07.679 --> 19:08.679
but it seemed urgent.

19:10.915 --> 19:12.149
All right.

19:12.216 --> 19:14.018
Thanks for the call.

19:14.085 --> 19:15.385
(Hangs up telephone)

19:15.453 --> 19:17.587
When Captain Ballard arrives,

19:17.656 --> 19:19.355
tell him the President
had an emergency meeting.

19:19.422 --> 19:21.390
Thank you, Lauren.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.626
Most of the chief of staff's
calls and texts

19:23.694 --> 19:25.028
are to the White House
and the capitol building.

19:25.095 --> 19:26.262
Also Alexandria,
where he lives.

19:26.329 --> 19:27.563
So we ignored
the bigger clusters

19:27.631 --> 19:28.931
and tracked the outliers.
(Taps key)

19:28.999 --> 19:30.967
We know that Charlie was
at the hospital

19:31.035 --> 19:32.935
and Heldon's bakery.
Which is where we pick up this number.

19:33.003 --> 19:34.670
Charlie's burner phone,
which you track by...

19:34.737 --> 19:36.471
Tapping into any L.B.S.
and inputting signal strength

19:36.539 --> 19:38.040
and coverage radii
of nearby towers.

19:38.107 --> 19:39.541
And now we can tell you
everywhere he's been

19:39.608 --> 19:40.909
- for the last month.
- It's easy, really.

19:40.977 --> 19:43.278
It's just
your basic multi-lateration.

19:43.345 --> 19:44.713
Yay, multi-lateration?

19:44.781 --> 19:47.115
Which brings us here...
a bookstore in Adams Morgan.

19:47.183 --> 19:49.084
He's been going there
every Thursday night

19:49.152 --> 19:50.818
- for the last month. - So the question
is, why does he go to a bookstore

19:50.886 --> 19:53.387
every week
with a box of cannolis?

19:53.456 --> 19:55.222
(Lowered voice) We've got too
many people in the office.

19:55.223 --> 19:56.823
Between your ex and Olivia's
shadow, there's too many people.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.291
- There's too many people
in the office. - So?

19:58.358 --> 20:00.526
So things could get out.
Secrets could be spilled.

20:00.594 --> 20:03.096
What do we have to hide?
Defiance is over.

20:03.164 --> 20:04.964
Lindsay is Quinn.
Everything's pretty much out.

20:05.032 --> 20:07.300
(Sighs) I just don't have
a good feeling.

20:07.367 --> 20:09.202
What the hell is he doing?

20:09.269 --> 20:11.470
Checking out
the community board?

20:11.538 --> 20:12.938
Great. We're no closer
to finding Charlie,

20:13.006 --> 20:14.206
but at least David will find
a a roommate

20:14.273 --> 20:16.809
- and a yoga instructor.
- Book club. Book club.

20:16.876 --> 20:18.276
That's great, David. That's
not why we came here, but...

20:18.344 --> 20:19.712
No, they have a book club
that meets here

20:19.779 --> 20:21.580
every Thursday night,
bring your own treats.

20:21.647 --> 20:22.881
Cannoli?

20:22.949 --> 20:25.784
Charlie joined a book club?

20:27.786 --> 20:29.820

but eight book clubs throughout
the D.C. metro area.

20:31.623 --> 20:32.856
Margie wasn't much of a talker,

20:32.924 --> 20:35.058
said she liked
Charlie's sweet treats.

20:35.127 --> 20:37.694
- Does her t-shirt say "Book lovers
never go to bed alone." - Yeah.

20:37.762 --> 20:39.230
Just got off of the phone
with Judy McGavin.

20:39.297 --> 20:40.797
After she was done
sharing her views

20:40.865 --> 20:43.300
on the similarities between
Kate Chopin and E.L. James...

20:43.368 --> 20:44.967
all good points, by the way...
She told me something useful.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.003
Charlie was close with a woman
named Tammy.

20:47.070 --> 20:48.371
The two of them always
left together.

20:48.439 --> 20:50.240
Tammy Blakely. You think...

20:50.307 --> 20:52.108
Charlie has a girlfriend?

20:52.176 --> 20:54.577
Book lovers never

21:04.420 --> 21:05.820
I said I'm on it.

21:05.888 --> 21:07.689
If you want me dutifully
back in the White House

21:07.757 --> 21:09.259
- standing by my man...
- I said I'm taking care of it

21:09.326 --> 21:13.362

21:13.429 --> 21:14.296
because...
(Beep)

21:16.633 --> 21:17.832
Captain Ballard.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.134
Mr. Beene.

21:19.201 --> 21:21.002
Are they handing out
overtime in the Navy?

21:21.070 --> 21:22.704
You trying to sneak in
some extra pay?

21:22.772 --> 21:25.040
Just obeying my orders.

21:30.345 --> 21:33.013
Step aside, <i>Captain.</i>

21:34.883 --> 21:36.449
Step aside,

21:36.517 --> 21:38.351
or I'll be forced
to tell the President

21:38.419 --> 21:41.421
about your hands-on approach
to protecting Olivia Pope.

21:41.489 --> 21:43.623
I'm sure he'll want
to discuss it with you.

21:45.393 --> 21:48.062
If the President and I are
going to discuss something,

21:48.129 --> 21:49.996
it'll be the fact that I
was called off my post

21:50.064 --> 21:52.899
by his secretary
a couple of hours ago.

21:52.966 --> 21:55.669
Guess I could have left
miss Pope alone tonight,

21:55.736 --> 21:59.005
but I only take orders
from the President himself.

22:13.453 --> 22:14.920
(Elevator doors close)

22:14.987 --> 22:18.123
(Clicking)

22:19.759 --> 22:20.959
(Closes)

22:21.027 --> 22:21.959
(Sighs)

22:28.667 --> 22:30.468
(Sighs)

22:35.741 --> 22:37.774
Cyrus is my friend.

22:37.842 --> 22:39.142
Then why didn't you
tell me to let him in?

22:42.079 --> 22:44.348
(Breathes deeply) Okay.

22:44.415 --> 22:45.982
All right, this thing between us...

22:46.050 --> 22:47.718
the thing where you hate me
and don't trust me,

22:47.785 --> 22:51.054
and I spend my days
trying to save your life...

22:51.122 --> 22:52.522
isn't working for me.

22:52.590 --> 22:54.457
So let's do this differently.
Let's just...

22:54.524 --> 22:56.659
(Sighs) be honest.

22:58.528 --> 22:59.862
How about I tell you something,

22:59.929 --> 23:01.497
and then you tell me
something, okay?

23:06.002 --> 23:07.470
A few weeks ago,
I broke in here

23:07.537 --> 23:09.404
and copied the flash drive
you have from Albatross.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.207
Now you tell me something.

23:13.276 --> 23:14.609
I think you're gonna have
to tell me more than that.

23:16.512 --> 23:18.513
I've been over those documents.

23:18.581 --> 23:20.782
Those documents, Liv,
are full of secrets...

23:20.849 --> 23:22.284
Secrets that are
only accessible

23:22.351 --> 23:24.185
by the highest echelons
of the administration...

23:24.253 --> 23:25.586
The President,
the Vice President,

23:25.654 --> 23:27.154
the secretary of defense,

23:27.221 --> 23:28.522
and the White House
chief of staff.

23:28.590 --> 23:30.491
And tonight,
the White House chief of staff

23:30.558 --> 23:33.494
called me off of your door,
and then he showed up here.

23:33.561 --> 23:35.228
You think Cyrus is the mole.

23:35.297 --> 23:37.831
- I think Cyrus is the mole.
- Cyrus is my friend.

23:37.899 --> 23:39.433
Then I will ask you again...

23:39.501 --> 23:40.801
Why didn't you tell me
to let him in?

23:42.403 --> 23:44.637
You think Cyrus
is the mole, too.

23:46.873 --> 23:48.608
I tell you something,
you tell me something.

23:50.611 --> 23:53.879
I agree it's possible
that Cyrus is the mole,

23:53.947 --> 23:55.515
but I can't wrap my head around it.

23:55.582 --> 23:58.216
Cyrus is many things,
but whoever's doing this

23:58.284 --> 23:59.785
is disloyal to the President,

23:59.852 --> 24:02.788
and Cyrus would never
be disloyal to Fitz.

24:02.855 --> 24:04.623
Unlike me.

24:04.691 --> 24:06.124
That's what you're
thinking that I'm being...

24:06.192 --> 24:07.992
disloyal to Fitz.

24:08.060 --> 24:09.928
I wasn't thinking anything
about you.

24:09.995 --> 24:12.964
I don't think about you.
(Laughs)

24:13.032 --> 24:15.098
You know why you're
so mad at me?

24:15.166 --> 24:17.234
- Because you like me.
- (Laughs) Okay.

24:17.302 --> 24:19.403
(Sighs)

24:19.471 --> 24:20.571
Olivia.

24:20.639 --> 24:22.272
Why did you sleep with me?

24:22.341 --> 24:24.208
Because...

24:24.275 --> 24:26.877
(Sighs) you're amazing.

24:26.945 --> 24:28.412
Because there's something
between us.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.646
Because I watched you
on those cameras

24:29.714 --> 24:31.314
day in and day out,

24:31.382 --> 24:33.516
and you never ceased...

24:35.753 --> 24:37.520
because I didn't know
you were the President's girl.

24:37.588 --> 24:40.122
I didn't know how deep
you were in with him.

24:40.190 --> 24:41.958
I don't know how deep
you're in with him.

24:42.025 --> 24:43.493
I think you're mistaken

24:43.561 --> 24:44.994
about my relationship
with the President.

24:45.062 --> 24:46.362
How deep are you in with him?

24:46.396 --> 24:48.330
I think we should
call it a night.

24:48.398 --> 24:50.265
You don't have to stand outside.

24:50.333 --> 24:51.867
You can sleep on the sofa.

24:51.934 --> 24:54.135
But I'm locking
my bedroom door.

24:54.203 --> 24:56.972
How deep are you in with him?

24:57.039 --> 24:59.241
Olivia, I tell you something,

24:59.308 --> 25:00.776
you tell me something.

25:02.578 --> 25:03.911
How deep?

25:08.384 --> 25:09.617
(Sets down glass)

25:21.596 --> 25:24.865
(Breathing heavily)

25:24.932 --> 25:26.299
How deep?

25:31.539 --> 25:34.440
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:55.167 --> 25:56.267
(Sighs)

25:56.334 --> 25:57.070
Cy.

25:58.637 --> 26:01.104
(Sighs) Do you want me
to sleep in the guest room?

26:01.172 --> 26:03.841
- Done. - No. I don't want you
to sleep in the guest room.

26:03.908 --> 26:07.110
Why?
Is it the nanny's room now?

26:07.178 --> 26:09.847
Mmm.
Mmm.

26:09.914 --> 26:11.949
Mmm.

26:14.452 --> 26:17.353
I want you to sleep
in <i>your</i> bedroom

26:17.420 --> 26:19.355
with <i>your</i> husband

26:19.422 --> 26:22.157
who loves you very much.

26:22.225 --> 26:25.628
(Unzips pants) Did
something happen today?

26:26.763 --> 26:28.965
They showed me my suits.

26:29.032 --> 26:31.066
(Chuckles)

26:31.134 --> 26:32.634
Your suits?

26:32.702 --> 26:34.135
A whole rack of them,

26:34.203 --> 26:35.837
perfectly tailored,

26:35.905 --> 26:39.207
with... with shirts and ties
and... and socks.

26:39.274 --> 26:41.409
I mean, I thought if I kept
my nose to the grindstone,

26:41.477 --> 26:44.078
I might get 45 seconds
holding onto a lamppost

26:44.146 --> 26:45.881
at the Riverfront
next hurricane season,

26:45.948 --> 26:48.416
but that's not what they want.

26:48.484 --> 26:50.318
They want me in the studio, Cy.

26:50.386 --> 26:53.021
They want me in a suit.

26:53.088 --> 26:55.589
And I don't know
how it happened,

26:55.657 --> 26:57.258
but I know that
you made it possible

26:57.326 --> 26:59.260
for me to say yes.

26:59.328 --> 27:01.695
You didn't fight me on it.
There wasn't a scene.

27:01.763 --> 27:07.667
You made it easy
for me to say yes.

27:07.735 --> 27:11.371
(Exhales)
So... so we're good.

27:11.439 --> 27:13.507
We're okay.

27:13.574 --> 27:16.309
Our marriage is okay?

27:16.377 --> 27:19.112
Why wouldn't it be?

27:19.180 --> 27:22.048
(Kissing)

27:25.118 --> 27:27.253
You gave me what I wanted.

27:36.796 --> 27:38.196
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

27:38.264 --> 27:41.767
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

27:41.834 --> 27:43.468
(Olivia) Thank you so
much for coming in.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.771
Your associate said you're doing
a background check on Charlie?

27:46.838 --> 27:48.138
From time to time,
our firm is hired

27:48.206 --> 27:49.974
to vet applicants
for high level positions...

27:50.042 --> 27:51.676
government, finance,
that sort of thing.

27:51.677 --> 27:52.443
We just wanna make sure

27:52.444 --> 27:54.345
he's as amazing as his
resume says he is.

27:54.512 --> 27:57.414
(Exhales) I knew he was special.
Not that he'd ever tell me.

27:57.482 --> 27:59.516
- He's so modest.
- I'm sure he is.

27:59.585 --> 28:01.985
Now just to confirm,
can you tell us

28:02.053 --> 28:03.753
where you and Charlie met?

28:03.821 --> 28:06.190
Barbara, I-I completely agree
with all the points you made,

28:06.257 --> 28:09.493
but frankly, I find the level
of violence in "Fifty Shades"

28:09.561 --> 28:11.195
to be more than
a little disturbing.

28:11.262 --> 28:14.098
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

28:16.633 --> 28:20.069
You're Charlie's... girlfriend?

28:20.137 --> 28:22.538
Well, it's only been a week, but yes.
(Laughs)

28:22.606 --> 28:24.840
So will you two be seeing
each other again soon?

28:24.908 --> 28:26.509
Oh, we've got a date later
today at the bookstore.

28:26.577 --> 28:28.711
Gotta choose our next book
for the club.

28:29.278 --> 28:30.613
I was thinking
"The Lovely Bones,"

28:30.680 --> 28:31.981
but maybe that's too dark.

28:32.048 --> 28:33.615
Charlie likes dark.

28:33.649 --> 28:36.851
Mm, okay, Tammy,
thank you for your time.

28:36.919 --> 28:38.720
Now remember, we still have
a couple people

28:38.787 --> 28:40.154
left to interview, so you
don't wanna tell Charlie

28:40.222 --> 28:42.456
about this meeting until
he tells you he's got the job.

28:42.524 --> 28:44.291
(Whispers) Okay.
Bye.

28:44.359 --> 28:45.627
Thank you.

28:45.694 --> 28:47.695
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

28:47.763 --> 28:49.963
What is happening?!

28:50.031 --> 28:50.998
(Woman) They say she's not in.

28:51.065 --> 28:52.265
She <i>is</i> in.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.501
There are news vans
in front of Blair house.

28:54.568 --> 28:56.703
The First Lady is in!

28:56.771 --> 28:59.006
You make 'em get her on the phone!
(Pounds desk)

29:07.014 --> 29:08.481
(Door closes)

29:08.549 --> 29:11.684
Mr. President...

29:11.752 --> 29:14.687
I have tried... everything,

29:14.755 --> 29:16.956
exhausted every approach.

29:17.024 --> 29:18.191
We have less than two hours

29:18.259 --> 29:20.126
before the First Lady's clock
runs out.

29:20.194 --> 29:23.462
I'm through discussing
Mellie's political maneuvers.

29:23.530 --> 29:25.330
No, sir, you're not.
You are not!

29:25.398 --> 29:27.032
She'll blink.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.300
She won't.

29:28.368 --> 29:30.369
Mellie loves being First Lady.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.870
The thing about Mellie
right now...

29:31.937 --> 29:33.605
the thing you don't seem to realize

29:33.673 --> 29:35.374
is that she's very
dangerous right now.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.108
She's a walking suitcase nuke
waiting to go boom,

29:38.177 --> 29:41.279
because she's not <i>thinking</i>
like the First Lady.

29:41.346 --> 29:42.446
She's not thinking like
the political animal

29:42.514 --> 29:43.614
I know she can be.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.216
Right now she's thinking
like a wife.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.917
She's thinking like
a woman scorned.

29:46.985 --> 29:49.220
She's thinking like
someone who's hurt,

29:49.288 --> 29:51.722
has been broken
one too many times.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.224
She's a credible threat
right now, sir,

29:54.292 --> 29:57.294
which is why there's
a BNC news satellite truck

29:57.361 --> 30:00.129
parked in front of Blair
house as we speak.

30:00.198 --> 30:03.300
Time to fold, sir, and give.

30:03.367 --> 30:05.402
Give her what she wants.
Just...

30:05.469 --> 30:08.405
Give her <i>whatever</i> she wants.

30:08.472 --> 30:11.373
You love this job?

30:11.441 --> 30:13.108
You love being President?

30:14.844 --> 30:17.913
You give for what you love.

30:17.980 --> 30:19.181
Give her the damn moon.

30:19.249 --> 30:22.551
Go to her.

30:22.619 --> 30:24.420
Save your presidency, sir.

30:24.487 --> 30:26.421
Because time is running out.

30:45.673 --> 30:47.307
Lauren?

30:47.375 --> 30:50.910
Let Tom and Hal know
we're on the move.

30:50.978 --> 30:52.912
(Sighs deeply)

30:55.383 --> 30:58.217
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

31:01.054 --> 31:03.256
Jake, you can take off.

31:03.323 --> 31:06.091
- Sir? - Secret service is here.
I won't be needing you.

31:06.159 --> 31:07.826
Yes, sir.

31:09.496 --> 31:10.429
And, Jake?

31:11.665 --> 31:13.865
Thank you for everything.

31:13.932 --> 31:15.400
(Door unlocks)

31:22.642 --> 31:24.576
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i>
What is happening?

31:24.644 --> 31:27.512
What do you mean?

31:27.580 --> 31:29.713
(Turns tv off, sets down remote
control) Why are you here?

31:29.781 --> 31:32.716
Someone said something
very wise to me today...

31:32.784 --> 31:37.220
"Give the person you love
whatever they want."

31:37.289 --> 31:41.858
So I'm here to find out...
What do you want?

31:41.926 --> 31:44.261
In 22 minutes,
Mellie's clock runs out.

31:44.329 --> 31:46.696
She's going public
tonight on prime time.

31:46.764 --> 31:48.831
In 22 minutes, Mellie's
going to go nuclear on you.

31:48.899 --> 31:51.734
You should be in your car heading
down Pennsylvania Avenue

31:51.802 --> 31:53.135
to Blair house
to repair your marriage

31:53.203 --> 31:54.737
or calling her on the phone
to repair your marriage.

31:54.805 --> 31:57.840
You should be doing something
to repair your marriage,

31:57.908 --> 32:01.143
because if you don't,
your chances for re-election...

32:01.211 --> 32:04.479
are very slim.
And that's <i>my</i> problem,

32:04.547 --> 32:05.647
not yours.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.683
And frankly, I don't care.

32:07.750 --> 32:13.522
I am here to find out
what do <i>you</i> want?

32:13.589 --> 32:15.957
Do you want me...

32:16.025 --> 32:17.558
or don't you?

32:17.626 --> 32:19.427
You don't care that the
clock is running out?

32:19.494 --> 32:21.729
I'm gonna sit here and run
out the clock with you.

32:21.797 --> 32:23.531
Does Cyrus know where you are?

32:23.598 --> 32:25.199
Maybe he can get Mellie to give
you an extension or something.

32:25.266 --> 32:26.634
Hang up the phone.

32:26.702 --> 32:29.337
Hang up the damned phone.

32:31.740 --> 32:34.674
(Cell phone beeps) You can't
fix the fact that I love you,

32:34.742 --> 32:38.878
that I love you more
than I love being President.

32:38.946 --> 32:40.747
I have told you

32:40.815 --> 32:44.317
that I'd give it all up
for you again and again,

32:44.385 --> 32:45.752
and you know what I think?

32:47.154 --> 32:49.488
I think you don't believe me.

32:49.556 --> 32:54.526
I think you believe
that I will never choose you.

32:56.629 --> 33:01.166
So this time,
I'm fixing things.

33:01.234 --> 33:04.837
We are gonna sit here
for the next...

33:04.904 --> 33:06.170
21 minutes.

33:06.238 --> 33:08.005
We're gonna sit here,

33:08.073 --> 33:11.442
and the clock on my marriage
is going to run out.

33:11.510 --> 33:12.677
We're gonna run it out
together.

33:12.745 --> 33:14.211
You're gonna watch me
run out this clock.

33:14.279 --> 33:17.948
You're gonna sit here with me
and watch me choose you.

33:18.016 --> 33:19.650
- You wouldn't.
- I <i>would.</i>

33:19.718 --> 33:21.352
I will. I'm going to.

33:23.220 --> 33:24.921
Sit with me.

33:24.989 --> 33:26.656
Sit with me, Liv.

33:26.724 --> 33:29.426
Sit with me,
and let's run out the clock.

33:29.494 --> 33:34.330
Sit with me...
and watch me choose you.

33:36.401 --> 33:38.401
Watch me earn you.

(Project and camera shutter
clicking) He didn't show?

36:45.592 --> 36:48.193
I must have come on too strong.

36:48.260 --> 36:49.894
I thought he liked me.

36:49.962 --> 36:53.064
I thought... (Sigh)
I followed all the rules.

36:53.132 --> 36:55.433
I only texted him
after he texted me.

36:55.501 --> 36:57.768
I didn't talk too much
about my birds.

36:58.536 --> 37:01.138
Oh, gosh, I hope this
doesn't affect the job.

37:01.206 --> 37:03.140
You shouldn't judge him
because he stood me up.

37:03.208 --> 37:05.108
He is a real good guy.

37:05.176 --> 37:07.511
He even bought me a new laptop
after mine was stolen.

37:07.579 --> 37:09.546
I thought he liked me.

37:09.614 --> 37:10.714
We won't judge him.

37:10.748 --> 37:12.015
We just wanted
to talk to you again,

37:12.082 --> 37:13.383
see if there was anything
else you could tell us.

37:13.451 --> 37:15.619
That might shed some light
on Charlie's character.

37:15.686 --> 37:18.087
12-T-566.

37:18.155 --> 37:19.988
I'm sorry?

37:20.056 --> 37:21.924
I have been racking my brain
trying to remember

37:21.991 --> 37:22.925
where I know you from,
and now I do.

37:22.992 --> 37:25.628
It's case number 12-T-566.

37:25.695 --> 37:27.262
You were on the grand jury panel?

37:27.330 --> 37:29.565
I'm a court stenographer.

37:29.633 --> 37:31.300
You transcribe the notes
on your laptop, don't you?

37:31.367 --> 37:33.168
That's why I freaked out
when it got stolen.

37:33.236 --> 37:35.570
I had over a year's worth
of cases on there.

37:35.638 --> 37:37.605
Can you, uh... (Clears throat)
excuse us for a moment?

37:44.847 --> 37:47.616
She was the stenographer
on the Defiance grand jury.

37:47.683 --> 37:48.884
You guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

37:48.952 --> 37:50.552
That's why Charlie found
her at book club.

37:50.553 --> 37:51.450
He wanted her laptop.

37:51.451 --> 37:52.319
He wanted the grand jury transcript.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.454
Because he wanted Defiance.

37:53.455 --> 37:56.222
Which means the mole
isn't Cyrus.

37:56.290 --> 37:58.291
- Cyrus already knew about defiance.
- He planned it.

37:58.292 --> 38:00.428
- He wants it to go away, not come out.
- So it's someone else.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.496
- Albatross is someone else.
- But who?

38:05.498 --> 38:06.633
(Jake)
I think I've been compromised.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.200
Explain.

38:08.268 --> 38:10.002
Cyrus Beene knows more about
my operation than he should.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.436
What does he know?

38:11.504 --> 38:13.605
Enough to blow my cover.
He could be dangerous.

38:13.674 --> 38:15.041
Need to find out who he has
working for him.

38:15.108 --> 38:17.043
Must be someone quite
talented if they got to you.

38:17.110 --> 38:18.277
Someone we know?

38:18.344 --> 38:20.445
Not sure.
If I can track them down,

38:20.513 --> 38:22.548
I'd like permission to engage.

38:22.615 --> 38:24.816
Just fix it.
But be neat about it.

38:24.884 --> 38:27.186
And for God sakes,
don't kill 'em.

38:27.253 --> 38:28.820
They might be useful to us.

38:40.332 --> 38:41.765
(Button clicks)

38:49.040 --> 38:50.274
(Button clicks)

38:57.715 --> 38:59.148
(Button clicks)

39:05.089 --> 39:08.525
(Button clicking)

39:47.828 --> 39:49.496
(Button clicks)

39:58.239 --> 39:59.906
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

40:01.675 --> 40:04.310
Mr. Beene?
The interview just started.

40:04.378 --> 40:05.344
I'm not watching.

40:05.412 --> 40:06.412
I think you better.

40:08.248 --> 40:11.216
Thank you for sitting down
with me tonight, Mrs. Grant.

40:11.285 --> 40:12.585
I-I have to say,

40:12.653 --> 40:14.754
this is not an interview
I was expecting to do.

40:14.821 --> 40:16.221
I understand it was your idea.

40:16.289 --> 40:21.859
It was, James, and believe me,
what I'm about to say...

40:21.927 --> 40:23.861
well...

40:23.929 --> 40:25.930
it's not an easy thing to admit.

40:25.998 --> 40:28.767
I don't care if he's on camera!
You turn the damn camera off!

40:28.834 --> 40:30.302
You go to commercial,

40:30.369 --> 40:31.903
and you put him on the phone
with me right now!

40:31.970 --> 40:35.539
I wanna talk to my freakin'
husband right now!

40:35.607 --> 40:40.411
Like so many other couples,
James, my husband and I...

40:40.478 --> 40:43.847
well... (Sighs)

40:43.915 --> 40:47.017
we have been experiencing
some...

40:47.084 --> 40:48.884
difficulties in our marriage.

40:48.952 --> 40:50.653
(Exhales deeply)

40:50.721 --> 40:53.989
Wh-what do you mean by that,
Mrs. Grant?

40:54.057 --> 40:56.326
Well, after we had the baby,
after the shooting,

40:56.393 --> 40:59.729
after I stood by him through
that whole terrible ordeal,

40:59.797 --> 41:02.498
I... found out that...

41:05.368 --> 41:08.269
my husband was unfaithful to me.
(Exhales deeply)

41:10.640 --> 41:13.408
Y-you're saying h-he...

41:13.476 --> 41:16.277
<i>I'm saying my husband</i>
<i>had an extramarital affair.</i>

41:16.346 --> 41:18.814
Huh.
Wonder who he banged.

41:20.316 --> 41:22.450
I got, uh...stuff.

41:22.517 --> 41:24.985
<i>And... (Exhales deeply)</i>

41:25.053 --> 41:27.221
<i>I have moved out</i>
<i>of the White House</i>

41:27.288 --> 41:29.323
<i>to take some time for myself...</i>
<i>(Inhales deeply)</i>

41:29.391 --> 41:31.726
<i>while we work through</i>
<i>this heartbreaking betrayal.</i>

41:31.793 --> 41:32.893
You're alleging that...

41:32.961 --> 41:37.263
No. I wish I were
alleging, James.

41:37.331 --> 41:40.266
So you're confirming

41:40.334 --> 41:42.435
that the President
of the United States

41:42.503 --> 41:45.605
has been cheating on you...

41:45.673 --> 41:47.774
his wife?

41:50.644 --> 41:51.778
Yes.

41:53.346 --> 41:55.381
And...

41:55.448 --> 41:57.282
(Both moaning)

41:57.350 --> 41:59.651
I just wanna ask
the American people tonight

41:59.719 --> 42:03.021
in advance
for their understanding

42:03.089 --> 42:04.623
and their forgiveness.

42:04.691 --> 42:07.693
(Telephone ringing)

42:07.761 --> 42:09.660
No one's marriage is perfect,

42:09.728 --> 42:13.498
and... I truly hope
that given time...

42:13.565 --> 42:16.267
(Ringing stops) and space,

42:16.334 --> 42:18.836
Fitz and I will be able to
repair what has been broken here

42:18.904 --> 42:22.339
and emerge from this stronger
and more united than ever.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.514
(Both breathing heavily)

42:34.752 --> 42:37.387
Hi.

42:39.891 --> 42:40.890
Hi.

42:43.660 --> 42:45.561

42:46.996 --> 42:50.666
