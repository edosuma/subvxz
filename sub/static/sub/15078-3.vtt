WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:07.241
WHICH COMES FIRST --
YESTERDAY OR TOMORROW?

00:07.275 --> 00:09.277
HANDS UP FOR YESTERDAY.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.980
RIGHT. AND TOMORROW?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.249
WOW. NOBODY?

00:15.283 --> 00:17.118
NOT ONE?

00:17.151 --> 00:19.253
MORTICIA,
EXPLAIN HOW YOU ARRIVED

00:19.287 --> 00:21.289
AT THAT PREDICTABLE,
BUT UNPROVABLE, CONCLUSION.

00:21.322 --> 00:24.158
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
ANYBODY HAS TO PROVE.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.026
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
YOU KNOW.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.295
Daniel:
SOMETHING YOU KNOW?

00:27.328 --> 00:29.997
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT
WHAT WE THINK OF

00:30.030 --> 00:31.199
AS PAST, PRESENT,
AND FUTURE

00:31.232 --> 00:33.301
IS NOTHING MORE THAN A --
THAN A STORY

00:33.334 --> 00:36.036
STITCHED TOGETHER
IN OUR BASAL GANGLIA.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.005
OUR ENTIRE CONCEPT OF TIME

00:38.038 --> 00:39.273
IS A --
IS AN ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCT.

00:39.307 --> 00:42.076
IN THAT CASE, I DON'T NEED
TO HAND IN MY LAB REPORT.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.212
BECAUSE FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
I ALREADY DID.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.313
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:45.346 --> 00:48.149
THAT IS ENTIRELY CORRECT!

00:48.182 --> 00:50.318
OF COURSE, BY THAT THINKING,
I MAY ALREADY HAVE FLUNKED YOU.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.220
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:52.253 --> 00:54.155
Max: ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCT
OR NOT,

00:54.188 --> 00:57.225
YOU HAVE A CURRICULUM REVIEW
WITH THE PROVOST IN 7 MINUTES,

00:57.258 --> 00:59.193
AND DON'T FORGET YOU'VE GOT
6 THESIS PROPOSALS TO REVIEW

00:59.227 --> 01:00.328
BEFORE OFFICE HOURS
AT 4:00,

01:00.361 --> 01:02.029
SO IF YOU COULD
PICK UP THE PACE?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.197
OKAY, YOU'RE OVERBOOKING ME,
LEWICKI.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.032
THE BRAIN NEEDS DOWNTIME
TO FUNCTION.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.300
NOT YOURS. WHAT DID YOU TELL ME
WHEN YOU HIRED ME?

01:06.334 --> 01:08.035
"SCHEDULE
EQUALS SANITY."

01:08.068 --> 01:09.303
IF YOU REALLY CARED
ABOUT MY SANITY,

01:09.337 --> 01:11.339
YOU'D KEEP THE PROVOST
OUT OF MY CURRICULUM.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.309
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:15.343 --> 01:18.179
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
A LITTLE BREAK WILL DO YOU GOOD.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.080
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.216
AND NEVER SAY
I DON'T BRING YOU TREATS.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.052
"EXTREME KAKURO."
VERY NICE.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.121
AGENT MORETTI.
HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

01:27.155 --> 01:29.223
I'M FINE. THANK YOU, MAX.
HOW ARE YOU?

01:29.257 --> 01:30.424
I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

01:30.458 --> 01:34.228
PROFESSOR PIERCE
IS A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.396
WELL, HE DOESN'T LOOK
VERY BUSY TO ME.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.231
IF YOU NEED A CONSULTANT,
I CAN INTRODUCE YOU

01:37.265 --> 01:39.367
TO ANOTHER VERY FINE PROFESSOR
IN THE DEPARTMENT.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.369
THANK YOU, MAX, BUT
IT'S REALLY DR. PIERCE
THAT I NEED TO TALK TO.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.237
I HATE TO SOUND DRAMATIC,

01:43.271 --> 01:45.206
BUT IT REALLY COULD BE
A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.209
DOC --

01:48.242 --> 01:49.343
YOU CAN TELL THE PROVOST
I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.

01:49.377 --> 01:52.079
OKAY, WHAT IF HE'S AD--

01:52.112 --> 01:53.214
AND IF HE COMPLAINS
THAT I'M LATE,

01:53.247 --> 01:55.183
TELL HIM IT'S ALL
IN HIS BASAL GANGLIA.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.121
Kate: REMEMBER
THE DATE NIGHT KILLER,

02:01.155 --> 02:02.156
SUMMER OF '86?

02:02.190 --> 02:03.357
VAGUELY.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.159
WAIT, DANIEL, IT WAS
THE CRIME OF THE DECADE.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.427
HOW CAN YOU NOT
REMEMBER THIS?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.462
WELL, IT'S A HARD TO KEEP UP
WITH THE NEWS

02:08.496 --> 02:11.131
WHEN YOU'RE CRAMMING
FOR YOUR MCATs.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.433
OKAY, FOR FIVE WEEKS
IN A ROW,

02:12.466 --> 02:15.269
EVERY FRIDAY, A GIRL WOULD
GO MISSING IN THE AFTERNOON

02:15.303 --> 02:17.438
AND TURN UP DEAD IN A LANDFILL
ON SUNDAY MORNING,

02:17.471 --> 02:19.273
RAPED AND BEATEN.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.441
WELL,
THE KILLINGS STOPPED,

02:20.474 --> 02:22.142
BUT THEY NEVER CAUGHT
THE GUY WHO DID IT.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.377
WHY ARE YOU WORKING
ON A COLD CASE?

02:23.411 --> 02:25.213
'CAUSE
IT'S NOT COLD ANYMORE.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.383
THESE ARE CLIPPINGS
FROM 1986.

02:29.417 --> 02:33.254
BUT SUNDAY BEFORE LAST,
A BODY TURNS UP IN AVONDALE,

02:33.287 --> 02:34.455
SAME M.O. AS '86,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.156
SAME CHLOROFORM BURNS
AROUND THE MOUTH,

02:36.190 --> 02:38.492
BUT CPD DIDN'T MAKE
THE CONNECTION

02:38.526 --> 02:41.495
UNTIL ANOTHER BODY SHOWED UP
JUST THIS PAST SUNDAY

02:41.529 --> 02:43.397
IN LINCOLNWOOD.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.299
BUT THIS TIME,
THEY GOT A PRINT.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.469
100% MATCH TO ONE OF
THE CRIME SCENES FROM BACK THEN.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.304
SO IF THE KILLER
STICKS TO THE PATTERN,

02:50.338 --> 02:51.472
ANOTHER GIRL DISAPPEARS
FRIDAY NIGHT.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.141
AND TURNS UP DEAD
ON SUNDAY.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.176
HOW CAN I HELP YOU
CATCH HIM?

02:56.210 --> 02:59.447
VICTIM NUMBER 6.
LACEY PENDERHALT.

02:59.480 --> 03:04.485
THE KILLER GRABBED HER
FRIDAY, JULY 18, 1986.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.354
THE NEXT DAY,

03:06.387 --> 03:08.188
A PROPANE STOVE BLEW UP
AN ABANDONED HOUSE IN MAYWOOD.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.291
FIREMEN FOUND LACEY
IN THE CELLAR,

03:10.324 --> 03:13.494
TIED UP, UNCONSCIOUS,
BUT ALIVE.

03:13.527 --> 03:17.197
BY THE TIME SHE CAME TO,
SHE WAS SO TRAUMATIZED,

03:17.231 --> 03:19.533
SHE HAD SOME KIND
OF A PSYCHOTIC BREAK.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.335
THE POLICE TRIED
TO QUESTION HER,

03:21.369 --> 03:23.203
BUT SHE WAS INCOHERENT.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.472
DID SHE EVER RECOVER?

03:24.505 --> 03:26.507
WELL, SHE'S BEEN LIVING
IN A PSYCHIATRIC NURSING HOME

03:26.540 --> 03:31.345
FOR THE PAST 26 YEARS,
APPARENTLY PRETTY OUT OF IT.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.180
AND YOU WANT ME TO SEE
IF I CAN GET THROUGH TO HER.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.483
THE BUREAU'S GOT 50 AGENTS
WORKING CRIME SCENES,

03:35.516 --> 03:38.252
CHASING DOWN LEADS,
TRACKING PRESENT-DAY VICTIMS.

03:38.286 --> 03:41.221
BUT I THINK
THAT THE ANSWER IS LACEY.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.257
WELL, IF I'M GONNA HAVE
ANY HOPE OF REACHING HER,

03:43.291 --> 03:45.326
I'M GONNA NEED TO KNOW
MOABSOLUTELY.S.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.527
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD HEAR IT SECONDHAND.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.462
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS
FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS THERE.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.197
WHO'S THAT?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.533
RETIRED POLICE DETECTIVE
JOE MORETTI,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.535
A.K.A. MY DAD.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.237
IT WAS A TERRIBLE SUMMER.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.573
I WOULDN'T LET KATIE
3 FEET OUT OF MY SIGHT.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.476
I WAS 6, DAD.
NOT EXACTLY THE TARGET DEMO.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.312
TALK TO ME
WHEN YOU'RE A PARENT.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.215
EVERY DETECTIVE
ON THE FORCE

04:08.248 --> 04:10.250
WAS WORKING SOME ANGLE
OF THAT CASE.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.219
MY SQUAD,
WE WERE CHECKING OUT

04:12.252 --> 04:13.487
THE CLUES
FROM THE KILLER'S JOURNAL.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.289
HE KEPT A JOURNAL?

04:15.323 --> 04:17.291
YOU BURIED THE LEAD,
AG[ CHUCKLES ]

04:17.325 --> 04:19.226
DON'T WORRY.
I BROUGHT A COPY.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.562
THEY FOUND THE ORIGINAL
IN THE WRECKED HOUSE.

04:21.595 --> 04:26.400
THIS IS WHERE THE KILLER KEPT
TRACK OF ALL HIS CRUSHES.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.502
"I MET THE MOST INCREDIBLE GIRL
ON THE EL TODAY.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.571
LILY --
ISN'T THAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME?"

04:30.604 --> 04:33.541
LILY PASETTI.
VICTIM NUMBER 3.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.409
SOUNDS LIKE
HE WAS FIXATED ON HER.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.244
YEAH, FOR A WEEK.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.313
EVERY MONDAY AND TUESDAY,
HE'D MEET A NEW GIRL,

04:39.347 --> 04:40.548
AND SHE'D BE "THE ONE."

04:40.581 --> 04:42.282
ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY,

04:42.316 --> 04:43.451
HE'D WRITE ABOUT DANCING
WITH THEM IN A CLUB

04:43.484 --> 04:44.618
OR SWIMMING WITH THEM
AT THE LAKE.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.620
AND EVERY SUNDAY,
IT WAS THE SAME THING --

04:46.654 --> 04:48.556
HOW THE GIRL
DISAPPOINTED HIM,

04:48.589 --> 04:51.525
HOW SHE'D BROKEN HIS HEART
OR TURNED OUT TO BE A PHONY.

04:51.559 --> 04:54.395
"I BOUGHT SANDRA A DRINK
AT THE BLACKLIGHT."

04:54.428 --> 04:56.430
ANYBODY AT THE BLACKLIGHT
SEE WHO BOUGHT HER A DRINK?

04:56.464 --> 04:57.631
SHE WAS A HOT NUMBER.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.434
FRIENDS SAID THERE WAS A TON
OF GUYS BUYING HER DRINKS.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.436
BUT WE COULDN'T PUT
ANY ONE OF THOSE GUYS

05:02.470 --> 05:04.538
AT THE CLUB
WHERE LILY WAS DANCING

05:04.572 --> 05:06.407
OR SWIMMING AT THE LAKE
WITH SUZANNE.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.342
BUT THE ENTRIES ABOUT LACEY
ARE DIFFERENT.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.444
"I SAW LACEY TODAY,
AND I THOUGHT,

05:10.478 --> 05:13.414
'WOW, SHE'S BEEN HERE
ALL SUMMER, EVERYWHERE I LOOK.'"

05:13.447 --> 05:14.548
HE KNEW HER.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.316
THAT'S WHY
WE WERE ALWAYS HOPING

05:16.350 --> 05:17.585
THAT LACEY
WOULD COME AROUND,

05:17.618 --> 05:21.288
BUT SHE'S NUTTIER
THAN GRANDMA'S FRUITCAKE.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.457
SORRY, KATIE.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.593
JUST A FIGURE OF SPEECH.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.496
WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT

05:28.529 --> 05:32.566
IS WHY HE WOULD TAKE IT UP AGAIN
AFTER A 26-YEAR VACATION.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.436
MAYBE HE GOT SCARED AFTER
YOU FOUND HIS HIDEOUT,

05:35.469 --> 05:37.438
OR MAYBE HE JUST FOUND
SOME OTHER WAY

05:37.471 --> 05:39.306
TO SCRATCH
WHAT WAS ITCHING HIM.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.642
EITHER WAY, IT'S TIME
TO GO TALK TO LACEY PENDERHALT.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.477
THANKS.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.446
AND MAYBE SOMEDAY
YOU'LL EVEN COME AROUND

05:45.479 --> 05:47.314
WHEN YOU DON'T NEED
SOMETHING.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.482
NO, NO, NO.
NO,DAD --O.

05:48.516 --> 05:52.352
I UNDERSTAND, FRESH IN TOWN,
NEW JOB, LOTS TO DO.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.355
SPEAKING
ABOUT FRESH IN TOWN,

05:55.389 --> 05:57.458
WHEN IS DONNIE
COMING IN FROM D.C.?

05:57.491 --> 06:00.661
SOON. DEFINITELY. YEAH, SOON.
I -- AND I'LL CALL YOU.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.362
NICE TYEAH.T YOU.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.599
WAIT.
I JUST REMEMBERED.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.602
I MET YOU PARENTS' NIGHT,
KATIE'S FRESHMAN YEAR.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.504
YOU'RE THE PROFESSOR
SHE HAD THE BIG CRUSH ON

06:10.538 --> 06:12.372
THE WHOLE TIME
S[ SQUEALS ] NOPE..

06:12.406 --> 06:13.541
WHAT?

06:19.747 --> 06:22.382
SO, YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
WHO DONNIE IS.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.617
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.519
WELL, IT'S OKAY.
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.620
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
ANYTHING.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.422
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.390
YOU'RE MARRIED?

06:30.424 --> 06:31.625
SOON-TO-BE DIVORCED.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.727
I MET HIM IN D.C.
IT JUST DID NOT WORK OUT.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.396
WHY ARE YOU LYING
TO YOUR FATHER ABOUT THAT?

06:36.430 --> 06:38.632
HE HATED DONNIE THE SECOND
HE LAID EYES ON HIM.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.568
"HE'S ALL WRONG FOR YOU,
KATIE."

06:40.601 --> 06:42.436
I JUST COULDN'T GIVE HIM
THE SATISFACTION

06:42.470 --> 06:43.671
OF KNOWING HE WAS RIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

06:43.704 --> 06:45.673
AGENT MORETTI?
DR. PIERCE?

06:45.706 --> 06:47.374
RYAN CUTLER.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.408
THANKS FOR SEEING US,
DR. CUTLER.

06:48.442 --> 06:49.710
DOES LACEY KNOW
WE'RE COMING?

06:49.743 --> 06:52.379
LACEY DOESN'T KNOW
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.515
IF YOU'RE HOPING FOR HELP
SOLVING YOUR CASE,

06:54.548 --> 06:56.416
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO BE
VERY DISAPPOINTED.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.759
HI, LACEY.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.566
MY NAME IS DR. PIERCE,

07:12.600 --> 07:15.536
AND THIS IS MY FRIEND,
KATE MORETTI, WITH THE FBI.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.572
IS IT ALL RIGHT IF WE ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS?

07:26.614 --> 07:28.582
I'LL COME BACK A LITTLE LATER,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

07:28.616 --> 07:32.820
I'M GONNA NEED TO SEE
HER COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY.

07:55.643 --> 08:00.514
I'M -- I'M, UH, TOLD
THAT I CAN BE A LITTLE ADDLED,

08:00.548 --> 08:01.715
SO, UH, LET ME SEE
IF I UNDERSTAND

08:01.749 --> 08:03.483
WHAT IT IS
THAT I'VE BEEN READING.

08:03.517 --> 08:04.752
26 YEARS AGO,
AFTER BEING BEATEN, RAPED,

08:04.785 --> 08:06.587
TIED UP AND GAGGED,

08:06.620 --> 08:09.456
LACEY PENDERHALT WAS
UNDERSTANDABLY HYSTERICAL,

08:09.489 --> 08:11.458
AGITATED, AND DISORIENTED,
FOR WHICH CONDITION

08:11.491 --> 08:13.594
SHE WAS ADMINISTERED
2 MILLIGRAMS OF LONOXONOL,

08:13.627 --> 08:15.495
WHICH, EVEN IN THAT
PREHISTORIC ERA,

08:15.529 --> 08:17.464
WAS 10 TIMES
THE RECOMMENDED DOSE

08:17.497 --> 08:19.533
OF A DANGEROUSLY
POWERFUL SEDATIVE,

08:19.567 --> 08:22.469
WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN PROVEN
TO TRIGGER PSYCHOSIS

08:22.502 --> 08:23.737
IN PATIENTS
WITH RECENT HEAD INJURIES.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.639
BECAUSE THE DRUG CAUSED LACEY
TO PRESENT AS PSYCHOTIC,

08:25.673 --> 08:27.474
SHE WAS DIAGNOSED

08:27.507 --> 08:29.677
WITH TRAUMATOGENIC
SCHIZO-AFFECTIVE DISORDER --

08:29.710 --> 08:32.746
A PHRASE I MERCIFULLY HAVEN'T
HEARD SPOKEN IN 20 YEARS --

08:32.780 --> 08:35.515
AND TREATED WITH HEAVY DOSES
OF CHLORPROMAZINE,

08:35.549 --> 08:38.552
ANOTHER GENUINE RELIC OF
PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC ANTIQUITY,

08:38.586 --> 08:40.520
WHICH RENDERED HER
NEARLY COMATOSE.

08:40.554 --> 08:41.755
THE NOW MENTALLY DISABLED
PATIENT

08:41.789 --> 08:43.557
WAS TRANSFERRED
TO A LONG-TERM CARE FACILITY,

08:43.591 --> 08:45.525
WHERE
THE SO-CALLED DOCTORS

08:45.559 --> 08:47.494
RUBBER-STAMPED
THE ORIGINAL DIAGNOSIS

08:47.527 --> 08:48.796
