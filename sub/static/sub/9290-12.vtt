00:12.200 --> 00:14.248
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.344 --> 00:16.456
- Hello, Sherry.
- David.

00:16.552 --> 00:18.729
Alan's determined to see Wayne removed...

00:18.825 --> 00:20.969
even if it means
destroying my presidency.

00:21.065 --> 00:24.137
You want me to find something
you can use against Alan.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.314
You think you can enlist
your psychopathic ex-wife...

00:26.410 --> 00:29.513
to manufacture lies about me
in order to bring me down?

00:29.609 --> 00:32.106
You want it to stop,
stay away from my brother.

00:32.202 --> 00:35.178
Jack, I think it's Amador.

00:35.274 --> 00:38.666
I've got the product.
There's an old mine east of Posta Mita.

00:38.762 --> 00:41.610
Meet me in the northernmost building
in an hour and 10 minutes.

00:41.706 --> 00:45.611
I'll have one man with me for security.
You may do the same.

00:45.708 --> 00:47.852
We are following through
with what you have started.

00:47.948 --> 00:50.188
- " There are too many risks now."
- "They are unavoidable."

00:50.284 --> 00:52.589
C.T.U., Dessler.

00:52.685 --> 00:56.429
Ramon, if you want this deal
to happen, we've gotta go now.

00:56.525 --> 00:59.277
Tony, Jack's on the line.
He's using his cell as a one-way.

00:59.372 --> 01:02.221
Amador's gonna be at the mine
in Posta Mita in about an hour.

01:02.317 --> 01:04.876
It's gonna take us that long to get there
and get your men into position.

01:06.509 --> 01:09.230
- It's disconnected.
- Based on what C.T.U. Got from Jack...

01:09.326 --> 01:11.150
the meeting'll probably
take place here.

01:11.246 --> 01:13.454
My forward position
is gonna be here.

01:13.550 --> 01:15.983
What I need from you is to put
your men behind this ridge...

01:16.078 --> 01:17.582
until we know that the virus is real.

01:17.679 --> 01:20.911
- How long will it take your men
to get to the old mine?
- Ninety seconds.

01:21.007 --> 01:22.415
Good luck.

01:22.512 --> 01:26.544
Ramon, if you want this deal
to happen, we have to leave now.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.103
We have to be at the mine
20 minutes before Amador gets there.

01:29.199 --> 01:31.440
The deal is off!

01:32.656 --> 01:35.216
We're leaving now.

01:36.977 --> 01:40.784
Hector!

01:47.441 --> 01:51.346
The following takes place
between 12:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m.

01:55.603 --> 01:58.067
- Are your people ready?
- Yeah, they're waiting.

01:58.163 --> 02:00.722
- What about Chloe?
- Yeah, she's there too.

02:00.818 --> 02:02.962
All right.
This is our one chance to get the virus.

02:03.058 --> 02:05.747
- So make sure they're all aware
of what's at stake.
- They're aware.

02:05.843 --> 02:08.020
I'm just saying it's all gonna
come down in the next hour.

02:08.116 --> 02:10.483
- I know, Tony. You don't have
to keep reminding me.
- Yes, I do!

02:10.610 --> 02:13.524
Look, too many things can go wrong here.
We don't need another mistake.

02:22.901 --> 02:26.998
So, um, have we had any communication
from Jack in the last few minutes?

02:27.093 --> 02:30.358
No. He's still with
Nina and the Salazars.

02:46.936 --> 02:49.303
You should have listened to me.

02:49.399 --> 02:51.288
This is my business.
I built it.

02:51.384 --> 02:54.168
And I won't let anyone
destroy it, not even you.

02:54.264 --> 02:57.080
Ramon.

03:00.025 --> 03:02.232
I can't stop the bleeding.
We gotta get him to a hospital.

03:02.329 --> 03:04.984
We can't!
They'll ask questions.

03:07.769 --> 03:10.809
- He'll die if we don't.
- I know.

03:16.186 --> 03:19.322
Ramon.

03:35.963 --> 03:39.324
Ramon, I'm sorry,
but we have to go.

03:42.365 --> 03:44.477
When you are done...

03:44.573 --> 03:46.942
I want him to have a proper burial.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.950
Ramon, you're making a big mistake.
He's setting you up.

03:54.046 --> 03:57.695
He works for C. T.U!
Hector was right.

03:57.791 --> 03:59.679
You should give this up.

04:03.134 --> 04:07.583
That's enough. Don't mention
my brother's name ever!

04:13.056 --> 04:16.096
All right, let's do the deal!
Everybody, back in the cars!

04:16.192 --> 04:18.079
Come on!

04:45.539 --> 04:49.219
Coordinate with C.T.U.
I want updates every half hour.

04:49.315 --> 04:50.916
Yes, sir.

05:03.076 --> 05:04.900
Yes.

05:04.996 --> 05:06.916
David.

05:07.012 --> 05:10.213
I just want you to know
that I'm leaving.

05:15.813 --> 05:17.638
This leverage you have with Milliken...

05:17.734 --> 05:20.678
I told you, David. It's better that
you don't know all the details right now.

05:26.855 --> 05:29.704
All right.

05:29.832 --> 05:32.648
Aaron told me that you refused
a Secret Service escort.

05:32.743 --> 05:34.855
Yes, but that's because
the person I'm going to see...

05:34.951 --> 05:37.640
might scare if
I don't come alone.

05:37.736 --> 05:41.064
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

05:42.664 --> 05:44.553
I know you can.

05:50.409 --> 05:52.906
- David?
- Mm-hmm?

05:53.002 --> 05:55.882
I still believe in your presidency.

05:55.978 --> 05:59.819
And if Alan Milliken is threatening
your ability to lead this country...

05:59.915 --> 06:02.091
he will be stopped.

06:16.396 --> 06:18.957
Amador's bringing
the virus to this location in 30 minutes.

06:19.276 --> 06:22.476
We have Delta teams bunkered
two minutes away...

06:22.540 --> 06:24.877
ready to intercept the package as soon
as Jack confirms it contains the virus.

06:24.973 --> 06:27.501
- Is Jack's transmitter working yet?
- No, we're using Chase.

06:27.597 --> 06:30.638
He's moving into a forward
covert position to give us confirmation.

06:30.734 --> 06:32.910
He'll be able to transmit sound
both to us and the Delta teams.

06:33.006 --> 06:34.829
- Who's running his comm?
- " I am."

06:34.925 --> 06:37.165
There wasn't any protocol in place,
so I wrote a software bridge.

06:37.261 --> 06:39.758
I'm amplifying the low-frequency
audio signal and relaying it out.

06:39.854 --> 06:42.702
- Okay, good.
- "After that, Chase will let us know..."

06:42.798 --> 06:45.583
when the transaction's complete,
and Jack has the virus.

06:45.678 --> 06:49.295
At which point, our units will move in,
taking full precautions to keep that virus safe.

07:38.676 --> 07:42.516
Ramon, you have to get your men
out of sight before Amador arrives.

07:42.612 --> 07:44.724
I know.
Take Nina and see her inside.

07:53.845 --> 07:55.797
All right, give me the map.

07:55.894 --> 07:58.582
Listen, I want some men
over here and some men over there.

07:58.678 --> 08:01.558
Tell them to keep their eyes open.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.478
Ramon, he's setting you up.

08:03.575 --> 08:06.102
- I can prove it.
- "Luis, espera."

08:10.775 --> 08:13.495
Really? How?

08:13.591 --> 08:16.536
I was at C.T.U. For seven years.
I know their protocols.

08:16.631 --> 08:18.680
I know how they'll play this.

08:18.776 --> 08:21.112
- I'm listening.
- Their attack teams won't be too close.

08:21.208 --> 08:24.345
They'll have at least one man
doing reconnaissance.
I bet he's watching us right now.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.297
And you know where
that man would be?

08:26.393 --> 08:28.953
Straight ahead, there's some high ground.
I bet he's there...

08:29.049 --> 08:32.313
- or 90 degrees to the west, at the tree line.
- We'll know soon enough.

08:32.409 --> 08:36.921
Felipe, Pablo, check it out. And make sure
you make your approach from the sides...

08:37.017 --> 08:39.514
- in case the woman is right.
- I am right.

08:41.208 --> 08:43.097
Vamonos.

08:54.427 --> 08:56.603
- Kim, I need you to go over
these format changes.
- Yeah.

08:56.731 --> 08:58.588
Here, you're gonna need
these files for the repagination.

08:58.684 --> 09:00.476
- "They're not on the hard drive."
- What is that?

09:00.572 --> 09:02.781
It's a baby.

09:02.877 --> 09:05.021
Yeah, I can see that it's a baby, Kim.
Whose baby is it?

09:05.117 --> 09:07.004
- Chloe's.
- "Chloe's?"

09:07.100 --> 09:10.140
- Her babysitter must have had
some sort of emergency...
- Chloe doesn't have a baby.

09:10.236 --> 09:12.220
- Of course she does.
- Uh, no, she doesn't.

09:12.316 --> 09:14.141
I was on the search team
when Chloe got hired.

09:14.237 --> 09:16.382
I did her background checks,
personal histories, medical histories...

09:16.478 --> 09:18.845
- "the whole thing."
- And she's never had a baby?

09:18.941 --> 09:21.182
No. It's definitely not "her" kid.

10:00.610 --> 10:04.642
Felipe, Pablo,
come in with your position.

10:04.739 --> 10:06.562
Ramon, es Felipe.

10:06.659 --> 10:08.770
- " Where are you?"
- "At the tree line."

10:08.866 --> 10:11.330
- There's no one here.
- Pablo, what about you?

10:13.667 --> 10:15.843
Pablo?

10:15.939 --> 10:18.628
Pablo, can you hear me?

10:18.723 --> 10:20.772
They got to him.

10:23.428 --> 10:26.628
- Pablo!
- He's dead, Ramon,
and they're coming for you next.

10:26.724 --> 10:30.213
What's going on?
What did you say to him?

10:32.229 --> 10:37.670
- What did you say to him?
- " Ramon, it's me."

10:37.766 --> 10:40.485
- I'm at the high ground.
- Do you see anything?

10:40.582 --> 10:42.598
No. There's no one here.

10:42.694 --> 10:47.686
All right, good. Hold your position
and keep your eyes open.

10:47.782 --> 10:49.607
Okay.

10:52.263 --> 10:54.311
Drop the walkie.

10:56.136 --> 10:59.272
No more lies from you.

11:03.336 --> 11:05.993
Amador will be here
in 15 minutes.

11:06.089 --> 11:10.408
Confirm that he has the virus, give him
his money, and bring the virus back to us.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.673
You'll have one of my men with you
acting as your bodyguard.

11:13.769 --> 11:17.769
But if you try to escape or communicate
anything to Amador, he will kill you.

11:17.865 --> 11:20.682
If he misses,
there are three men in the hills...

11:20.778 --> 11:23.113
with sniper rifles
aimed at your head.

11:23.210 --> 11:26.506
If you want to live,
make sure this deal happens.

11:26.634 --> 11:29.483
- Understood.
- "Good."

11:59.310 --> 12:00.430
How's Angela?

12:01.678 --> 12:04.782
Adam just told me you're not
the mother of this child.

12:04.879 --> 12:06.895
Who does the baby belong to?

12:09.135 --> 12:11.246
My boyfriend, Eric.

12:11.342 --> 12:14.318
- Eric?
- Binder. His name's Eric Binder.

12:14.414 --> 12:16.334
So why isn't he taking care
of his daughter?

12:16.431 --> 12:19.855
Because it's the first place
his ex-wife would look.

12:19.951 --> 12:22.095
His ex-wife has custody of the baby.
A few weeks ago...

12:22.191 --> 12:24.176
she started seeing this guy
with a drinking problem.

12:24.272 --> 12:27.024
And then Eric found out that this guy
was abusing the baby physically.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.361
So why doesn't the ex-wife
stop the boyfriend?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.441
Apparently,
she's in some kind of denial.

12:31.537 --> 12:34.609
So why doesn't he call
Child Protective Services?

12:34.705 --> 12:36.529
Eric has.

12:39.538 --> 12:42.577
He saw a social worker this morning,
but she couldn't make it out until tomorrow.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.946
- He's afraid by then it'll be too late.
- Wait. He's kidnapping Angela?

12:45.042 --> 12:47.602
Technically, but just for tonight.

12:47.698 --> 12:50.002
Yeah, well, I don't care, Chloe.
Kidnapping is a felony.

12:50.098 --> 12:52.563
You wanna call the police?
Then go ahead and call the police.

12:52.659 --> 12:55.923
But if this child is returned to its mother and
something bad happens, then that's on you.

12:56.019 --> 12:58.228
- So think about that, Kim. Think about it.
- "Chloe."

12:58.324 --> 13:01.172
- Tony needs you.
Chase is transmitting from Posta Mita.
- I'll be there in a minute.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.124
No, he needs you now.

13:06.772 --> 13:08.660
Is there a problem?

13:11.476 --> 13:13.909
- No. No problem.
- Good.

13:16.181 --> 13:18.901
Let me know how much
of her bottle she takes.

13:34.839 --> 13:37.144
- Mr. Kelly?
- Yeah. Come on in.

13:42.103 --> 13:45.784
Have a seat. Go on.

13:50.968 --> 13:55.224
- Drink?
- Um, no, thank you.

13:58.585 --> 14:00.825
We appreciate your help
on this, Mr. Kelly.

14:00.921 --> 14:03.514
"We" meaning you
and the president, right?

14:03.610 --> 14:06.202
I am representing
the president on this, yes.

14:08.442 --> 14:12.699
So, what can I tell you?

14:14.202 --> 14:16.027
You can tell me
what really happened.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.171
What do you think happened?

14:18.267 --> 14:22.396
I think Alan Milliken
was driving the car...

14:22.492 --> 14:25.340
that hit and killed your daughter
12 years ago.

14:29.181 --> 14:31.740
I... I wouldn't know.

14:31.836 --> 14:35.069
You testified that you didn't
see anything, but I think you did.

14:36.349 --> 14:39.998
And I think what you saw
implicates Milliken.

14:47.934 --> 14:50.014
Three weeks after
your daughter's death...

14:50.110 --> 14:52.958
an account was set up
in your name at Maritime Bank...

14:53.054 --> 14:55.903
and a large deposit was made.

14:55.999 --> 14:58.399
That was to keep
your mouth shut, wasn't it?

15:02.208 --> 15:05.664
This is a chance
for you to set everything right.

15:10.273 --> 15:12.640
Yeah.

15:12.769 --> 15:14.656
I saw Milliken
driving the car that night.

15:16.097 --> 15:19.233
Got the license plate
and everything.

15:21.057 --> 15:23.905
But when I told that to the cop...

15:24.001 --> 15:28.514
he takes me aside and he says...

15:28.610 --> 15:31.331
"Your daughter's dead.

15:31.427 --> 15:35.683
"Nothing you can do about that now.

15:35.811 --> 15:40.964
"But if you keep your mouth shut,
there's... there's a payoff.

15:41.060 --> 15:42.884
A big one."

15:44.099 --> 15:48.292
So, I said I didn't see
who killed my daughter.

15:51.236 --> 15:54.437
It was blood money,
and I took it.

16:07.302 --> 16:09.127
Mr. Kelly?

16:11.686 --> 16:15.847
Mr. Kelly, we are gonna have
a press conference...

16:15.943 --> 16:20.423
and you are gonna have a chance
to tell your story to everyone.

16:20.518 --> 16:23.720
- I'm not gonna be doin' this
for nothing, Mrs. Palmer.
- Okay, that's all right.

16:23.815 --> 16:25.864
- "How much money will" it...
- No, I don't want money.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.064
- "I've already made that mistake."
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Then what do you want?

16:29.160 --> 16:31.433
My son.

16:31.529 --> 16:34.153
My only living child.

16:34.249 --> 16:36.585
He's doing a prison term...
life sentence.

16:36.681 --> 16:39.338
I want the president
to pardon him.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.705
- What was he convicted for?
- Murder.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.649
He's all I've got.
You get him out of prison...

16:44.745 --> 16:48.393
and-and I'll tell anyone who wants to listen
what really happened that night.

16:57.643 --> 17:01.643
I don't care what Ramon thinks.
I know you're still working with C.T.U.

17:01.739 --> 17:05.228
- I want them there and there.
- You don't know anything.

17:05.324 --> 17:08.715
My interests happen to coincide with
Ramon's at this moment, and he knows it.

17:08.811 --> 17:11.277
You may have convinced everybody else
of that, but I don't believe it.

17:11.373 --> 17:14.924
You keep shooting your mouth off,
you're gonna get yourself killed.

17:15.020 --> 17:17.997
It doesn't matter. Once he gets the virus,
he's gonna kill us both.

17:18.093 --> 17:20.300
Get the rest of the cars out of sight.

17:27.021 --> 17:29.966
Uncuff her.
She needs to get going.

17:30.062 --> 17:31.950
Get the briefcase.

17:38.319 --> 17:41.488
If there's trouble, kill her first.

17:57.745 --> 18:00.401
She's got one of
Salazar's bodyguards with her.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.609
All right. Michelle,
send the teams to their final marks.

18:02.705 --> 18:05.073
Everybody, get set.
This is it.

18:21.875 --> 18:25.556
Myers and Salazar's man are
holding about 300 meters from my location.

18:25.652 --> 18:27.508
- Edmunds is still on point.
- There's been no activity.

18:27.604 --> 18:29.972
Make sure the Delta commander
has his field protocol straight.

18:30.068 --> 18:33.525
- Almeida.
- It's Kim.

18:33.621 --> 18:35.765
I need to talk to you in private.

18:35.861 --> 18:38.229
- Right now?
- Yeah. It's about Chloe.

18:38.357 --> 18:41.334
It's important.

18:41.429 --> 18:44.342
All right. Tech one.

18:44.438 --> 18:46.485
Keep me posted.

18:47.990 --> 18:52.022
You want me to pardon this man's son,
a convicted murderer?

18:52.118 --> 18:54.422
I know I'm asking a lot, David...

18:54.518 --> 18:59.222
but unless you pardon Kelly's son
for that crime, he's not gonna help us.

18:59.318 --> 19:01.207
And how exactly
is he supposed to help us?

19:01.335 --> 19:03.735
Twelve years ago,
Kelly was paid off...

19:03.863 --> 19:06.456
not to come forward
as a witness against Milliken.

19:06.552 --> 19:11.000
- What did he witness?
- Milliken killing his daughter
while driving drunk...

19:11.097 --> 19:13.784
then drove off...
hit-and-run.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.705
Kelly was the only one who saw it.

19:15.801 --> 19:18.328
Then Milliken's people got to him
before the police report was filed.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.624
- And he'll swear to this?
- All you have to do is pardon the son.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.608
His name is Patrick Kelly.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.201
He's already served
four years of a life sentence.

19:27.994 --> 19:29.882
I don't know, Sherry.
I'll have to get back to you on this.

19:29.978 --> 19:31.770
Just hurry, okay?

19:38.138 --> 19:40.347
- What do you think?
- You know what I think.

19:40.443 --> 19:43.132
You shouldn't be involved
in this, David.

19:43.228 --> 19:45.724
Give in to Milliken,
accept my resignation...

19:45.819 --> 19:47.643
- "and he'll back off..."
- I told you.

19:47.739 --> 19:50.908
I am not Milliken's puppet,
and I will not let him dictate my decisions.

19:51.004 --> 19:52.828
Right, but you're gonna let
your ex-wife convince you...

19:52.924 --> 19:56.765
to grant a quid pro quo pardon
to a convicted murderer.

19:56.892 --> 19:59.933
David, she's only been back in your life
for a few hours, and look what's happening.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.029
I would think you'd be in favor
of what she's proposing.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.949
Of you what,
abusing the power of your office?

20:06.045 --> 20:08.862
Absolutely not, David.
Absolutely not. It is wrong.

20:10.622 --> 20:13.822
When you wanted me to pay
hush money to Anne's ex-husband...

20:13.918 --> 20:17.087
that was justified?

20:17.183 --> 20:19.007
The difference is that...

20:20.798 --> 20:24.031
David, I have your best interests at heart.
You know that.

20:25.887 --> 20:29.375
Now, I'm sorry, but Sherry
has her own, and she always has.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.184
Your loyalty,
which I am grateful for...

20:37.280 --> 20:39.841
does not change the fact...

20:39.937 --> 20:43.362
that when someone wants
to get down in the mud...

20:43.458 --> 20:46.050
the only way to fight back
is to get down in it with him.

20:46.146 --> 20:47.969
So you're gonna grant
the pardon?

20:51.713 --> 20:53.697
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

20:57.218 --> 20:59.586
- Okay, Kim, what is it?
- Tony, there's something you need to know...

20:59.715 --> 21:02.787
If this is about Chloe's baby,
I don't have time to deal with this right now.

21:02.883 --> 21:04.707
It's not her baby.

21:04.803 --> 21:07.748
Chloe does not have a baby.

21:07.844 --> 21:10.820
- And, frankly, I think she's delusional.
- What are you talkin' about?

21:10.916 --> 21:14.213
Look, Chloe does not have a child.

21:14.309 --> 21:17.221
I confronted her, and she said that
this was her boyfriend's baby...

21:17.317 --> 21:20.804
and that the mother of this child
was letting her get abused.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.788
But, Tony, I spoke to
Child Protective Services...

21:22.917 --> 21:25.700
- and they said that
there was no abuse claim filed.
- You sure?

21:25.797 --> 21:28.902
Positive.

21:28.998 --> 21:30.886
Have you talked to Chloe
since you found this out?

21:31.014 --> 21:33.382
No. When I confronted her,
she was on the verge of losing it.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.495
Look, this is what I'm worried about.

21:35.591 --> 21:37.799
I think she's unstable.

21:46.983 --> 21:51.655
Kim, I need you
to take a step back here.

21:51.751 --> 21:53.864
My father and Chase's lives
are in her hands.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.424
Yeah, that's exactly why we can't
do anything about this right now.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.464
- What do you mean?
- Chloe is our only lifeline
to what's going on down there.

21:59.560 --> 22:03.496
She's the only one capable of filtering
audio streams that Chase is sending us.

22:03.593 --> 22:06.121
- If Chloe is unstable...
- Look, we don't have an alternative right now.

22:06.217 --> 22:09.033
We have got to keep her in place.

22:09.129 --> 22:11.946
What about the baby?
Whoever her parents are...

22:12.042 --> 22:14.186
they must be going
out of their minds right now.

22:16.203 --> 22:18.954
You're gonna take care
of that baby till this operation is over.

22:19.051 --> 22:21.898
I do not want Chloe distracted.

22:25.259 --> 22:27.083
Hey, I'm not happy about this either.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.035
Let's just hope Chloe holds it together.

22:29.131 --> 22:32.427
We'll deal with the baby
once we get possession of that virus.

22:44.717 --> 22:46.638
Mr. Kelly?

22:46.765 --> 22:48.782
Mr. Kelly?

22:52.877 --> 22:54.765
Mr. Kelly?

24:13.526 --> 24:15.734
Hold on.
I hear something.

24:15.830 --> 24:17.846
It's a car approaching.

24:17.942 --> 24:20.150
Tony, Chase is reporting
a car approaching.

24:20.247 --> 24:22.230
Salazar's men are sitting tight.

24:22.326 --> 24:25.015
- There's no sign of Amador's men
and no other vehicles.
- Chase?

24:26.455 --> 24:30.551
I've got a visual.
Two men inside.

24:30.647 --> 24:33.016
It's Amador and his bodyguard.

24:34.136 --> 24:37.976
Ramon, Amador is arriving.

24:43.097 --> 24:44.985
They're exiting the car.

24:45.113 --> 24:46.937
Amador's got a case in his hand.

24:47.033 --> 24:48.857
- How far is Delta?
- Ninety seconds away.

24:48.953 --> 24:51.194
No one makes a move
until we're sure it's the virus.

24:51.290 --> 24:54.585
- Understood?
- Understood.

24:56.346 --> 24:58.010
Do you have it?

24:58.106 --> 25:00.730
- Yes.
- "Good."

25:00.826 --> 25:03.771
The transfer protocol for the funds
is in place with the bank?

25:03.867 --> 25:07.643
I'll transfer the funds once I verify
the virus. So let's see it.

25:11.419 --> 25:13.500
It looks like
he's gonna give her the virus now.

25:22.908 --> 25:24.892
He's taking a canister from the case.

25:24.988 --> 25:26.812
He's unscrewing the lid.

25:49.760 --> 25:53.344
It should take about five minutes
to confirm it's the virus.

26:13.954 --> 26:16.258
Damn it!
We don't have enough audio filters.

26:16.354 --> 26:19.587
- There's a library on Etudes Three. Should I use it?
- Yeah.

26:21.218 --> 26:23.267
- "Mr. Palmer, this is Tony Almeida."
- Give me an update on things.

26:23.363 --> 26:27.970
The exchange of the virus hasn't happened yet,
but we expect it to go down at any moment.

26:28.067 --> 26:31.203
Tony, the Pentagon is furious at having to play
catch-up, and I sure as hell don't blame them.

26:31.299 --> 26:35.108
Now, this operation began as
a secret between three C.T.U. Agents...

26:35.236 --> 26:36.739
and, again, I will reiterate...

26:36.868 --> 26:39.204
when this is over the president
will hold all three of you accountable.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.124
I understand, sir.

26:41.220 --> 26:43.460
But if you're just calling to reprimand me,
you're doing us both a disservice.

26:43.557 --> 26:47.269
- I need to focus on this operation.
- This operation, how large is it?

26:47.365 --> 26:50.438
We have half a dozen Delta teams
in the area waiting for the signal to go in.

26:50.534 --> 26:52.646
- Will that be sufficient?
- Well, it has to be.

26:52.742 --> 26:55.109
Any more bodies down there,
we run the risk of being spotted.

26:55.238 --> 26:59.174
- Okay, tell me exactly what's gonna happen.
- We don't have time for this.

26:59.270 --> 27:02.566
Tony, you've asked the president
to support you on this, and he has.

27:02.694 --> 27:06.343
You put him way out on a limb here.
Now he wants to know what the plan is.

27:06.438 --> 27:09.031
Michael Amador, the seller...

27:09.127 --> 27:11.271
will hand the virus over
to Nina Myers.

27:11.367 --> 27:14.215
Now, he doesn't know that
Nina Myers is now under our control.

27:14.311 --> 27:17.160
Once the exchange happens, the Delta
teams will move in, secure the virus...

27:17.288 --> 27:21.288
take Nina Myers, Michael Amador
and Ramon Salazar into custody.

27:21.385 --> 27:23.785
Sounds like an awful lot of things
are gonna have to go perfectly.

27:23.913 --> 27:25.736
That's true.

27:25.832 --> 27:29.161
- But we're pretty sure
we have our bases covered, sir.
- Pretty sure isn't good enough.

27:29.289 --> 27:31.273
You make this happen.

27:32.489 --> 27:34.954
Yes, sir.

27:35.050 --> 27:36.874
How much longer?

27:36.970 --> 27:38.794
Chase is watching.
It looks like Nina Myers...

27:38.890 --> 27:41.450
is still testing to confirm
that it is in fact the Cordilla virus.

27:41.546 --> 27:43.787
- Let me know the second
Chase sees any movement.
- I know to do that.

27:43.883 --> 27:45.707
Then do it!

27:45.803 --> 27:48.459
- I put an extra audio filter on your volume.
It might help.
- I don't need it.

27:48.555 --> 27:51.307
- But you asked for it.
- I found a plug-in that worked fine.

27:51.404 --> 27:55.116
- Why didn't you tell me that
instead of wasting my time?
- Leave me alone, Adam!

28:04.652 --> 28:07.021
Tony.

28:07.117 --> 28:09.133
Yeah.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.053
There are some things about Chloe
that concern me.

28:11.149 --> 28:12.973
I know about the baby.
Kim told me.

28:13.069 --> 28:15.437
Are we right to be letting her
run point on this thing?

28:15.565 --> 28:18.222
In the next few minutes, if we make
any mistakes we could lose the virus.

28:18.318 --> 28:21.102
Adam, channel two is floating.
Use the phase loop to lock it down.

28:21.198 --> 28:24.623
It'll be okay.
Just do what she says.

28:29.774 --> 28:31.599
What's the matter?

28:31.695 --> 28:33.775
They changed the access code
to Division again, didn't they?

28:33.871 --> 28:36.431
Yeah. Here.

28:43.216 --> 28:45.905
There.

28:46.001 --> 28:47.889
Thanks.

28:51.409 --> 28:54.354
" Okay, we're on."

28:57.425 --> 28:59.665
The testing device
might be finishing up right now.

28:59.761 --> 29:02.226
- Chase, what's going on?
- It looks like they're
about to get confirmation.

29:08.754 --> 29:11.379
- The signatures match.
- It's the virus.

29:11.475 --> 29:13.523
- I repeat, it is the virus.
- All right, send Delta in.

29:13.619 --> 29:15.347
Delta teams, you have a green light.
Go, go!

29:17.523 --> 29:21.268
I'll take that...
until the funds are in place.

29:41.366 --> 29:43.670
- Transfers.
- Fund transfer locator...

29:43.767 --> 29:48.502
65-1911374.

29:48.631 --> 29:51.351
Waiting to confirm.

29:51.447 --> 29:55.992
Your bank is on the phone
to confirm the transfer of the funds.

29:56.088 --> 30:00.727
- Yes.
- 65-1911374 verified.

30:00.823 --> 30:02.999
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.121
Our business is done.

30:08.217 --> 30:10.585
Good luck.

30:14.745 --> 30:18.553
Amador is out of the building. He's left
the case containing the virus with Nina.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.915
They're in the car,
turning around heading north.

30:30.331 --> 30:32.635
- Have a Delta unit pick him up.
- Okay.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.939
Nina's on her way.

30:37.531 --> 30:40.188
- She's carrying the ca... vile.
- What'd he say?

30:40.284 --> 30:42.012
He said he thinks
Nina's leaving with the virus.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.604
What is wrong with this?

30:44.700 --> 30:46.524
- "Chloe, the channel's modulating."
- "I know."

30:46.620 --> 30:50.525
- I'm switching to a sat 9.
- What? In the middle of the meet?

30:50.621 --> 30:52.445
What the hell's goin' on?
All I'm gettin' is static.

30:52.541 --> 30:54.654
- "It'll be fine."
- What are you doing? Switch it back to sat 3.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.413
- No!
- Are you crazy?

30:56.510 --> 30:59.613
Sat 3 is out of range.
I noticed a glitch in its relay software.

30:59.709 --> 31:01.885
I had to switch over. Otherwise,
we would have lost it completely.

31:01.981 --> 31:04.638
Chase, do you copy?

31:04.734 --> 31:07.358
Chase, do you copy?

31:14.047 --> 31:16.127
You should be getting
a clear signal now.

31:16.223 --> 31:18.112
Chase, do you copy?

31:21.248 --> 31:23.968
- "Chase, do you copy?"
- Yeah, I copy.

31:24.064 --> 31:28.417
Nina's still in visual range.
She's headed towards the building.

31:28.513 --> 31:31.648
Delta's 50 seconds away.

31:34.337 --> 31:36.609
Let's go.

31:57.476 --> 31:59.363
Good job.

32:00.515 --> 32:02.532
Ramon, we should go.

32:07.428 --> 32:09.956
No, Jack.
I don't need you anymore.

32:10.052 --> 32:12.740
He's gonna kill him.
Delta team's not gonna get there in time.

32:12.836 --> 32:15.237
- Ramon, we had a deal.
- My brother died because of you.

32:15.365 --> 32:17.094
Because of you! Aah!

32:17.189 --> 32:20.006
Chase!

32:27.559 --> 32:29.447
Chase!

32:29.575 --> 32:31.399
- "Chase, come in!"
- Tony, Delta's here.

32:31.495 --> 32:33.222
I'm movin' in.

33:09.834 --> 33:11.722
Ramon!

33:15.147 --> 33:18.731
Ramon Salazar's on the move with
the virus. Repeat: He has the virus!

33:18.827 --> 33:22.028
He's headed west between the buildings.
Jack is in pursuit.

33:26.124 --> 33:30.861
You two, you're with me! All men
in pursuit, repeat, Salazar has the virus!

34:02.607 --> 34:05.520
- Hello?
- Hello, Julia? It's Sherry Palmer.

34:05.648 --> 34:08.143
I'm sorry to call so late, sweetie.
Are you alone?

34:08.239 --> 34:11.920
Yes. It is very late, Sherry.
Why are you calling?

34:12.016 --> 34:14.257
Because I know what your husband
is doing to David.

34:14.353 --> 34:17.072
- I can't do anything about that.
- No, that's not true.

34:17.168 --> 34:19.793
You mean you don't see any reason
to do anything about it.

34:19.889 --> 34:22.898
- But I'm gonna give you a reason.
- What are you talking about?

34:22.994 --> 34:24.850
I know your situation, Julia.

34:24.946 --> 34:27.795
I know Alan is too controlling
to let you go...

34:27.891 --> 34:31.187
and I know you're not willing
to sacrifice everything to get out.

34:31.283 --> 34:33.458
You're making a lot of assumptions,
and I'm hanging up.

34:33.554 --> 34:35.378
No, I'm telling the truth,
and you know it.

34:35.475 --> 34:37.650
But I can help you, Julia.

34:37.746 --> 34:41.170
I can help you get away from Alan
without having to give everything up.

34:41.268 --> 34:44.179
- This is ridiculous.
- You know me, Julia.

34:44.308 --> 34:48.755
When I say I can make something happen,
you better believe I can.

34:51.476 --> 34:53.301
How would you do this?

34:53.397 --> 34:55.476
- First of all, we need to meet in person.
- "When?"

34:55.572 --> 34:58.101
It has to be now.

34:58.197 --> 35:00.598
I can't leave the house this time of night
without Alan wondering what I'm doing.

35:00.726 --> 35:02.901
Then I'm coming to you.

35:10.166 --> 35:12.854
"Jack, hold your fire."

35:12.950 --> 35:14.838
- Chase?
- Yeah.

35:14.966 --> 35:18.199
- You're all right.
- Yeah, I'm all right.

35:18.295 --> 35:21.080
Our first priority is the virus.
Ramon is our second.

35:21.176 --> 35:23.896
Anybody gets a visual,
standing order is do not fire.

35:23.992 --> 35:26.040
- Are we clear?
- Copy.

35:26.136 --> 35:28.857
I lost him coming down the path,
but if I were him, I'd have headed north.

35:28.953 --> 35:31.641
Headed north, he'll run into the river.

35:31.737 --> 35:34.424
Give the chopper our coordinates.
Tell them to converge on the river.

35:34.521 --> 35:36.697
Send another team back down the path
in case he doubles back.

35:36.793 --> 35:39.224
- Four of you down that path.
I want two of you with me.
- Copy.

35:39.353 --> 35:41.721
- Let's go! Move!
- Ramon is in possession of the virus.

35:41.849 --> 35:44.602
He's headed north of position 453.6.

35:44.697 --> 35:46.937
Roger, 453.6.

35:51.834 --> 35:54.203
This is Air One, Air One.
We have visual confirmed.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.923
It's over, Ramon!

36:05.019 --> 36:06.843
There's nowhere else
for you to go.

36:06.939 --> 36:08.828
I'm not going back to jail!

36:08.924 --> 36:11.100
Put the cylinder down
and we'll talk about it.

36:12.508 --> 36:16.956
Stop, Jack. There's nothing to talk about!

36:17.052 --> 36:19.645
Put the cylinder down!

36:19.741 --> 36:23.998
I don't wanna have to shoot you.
Just put the cylinder down.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.206
- Jack, say the word.
- Not now.

36:27.358 --> 36:29.983
Ramon, I have the authority
to cut a deal.

36:30.079 --> 36:32.927
All we want is the virus.
Just put the cylinder down slowly.

36:35.006 --> 36:37.631
Please, I don't wanna shoot you.

36:44.671 --> 36:48.448
There you go.
Just put it on the ground nice and easy.

36:52.257 --> 36:54.401
Good.

36:56.865 --> 36:58.753
Get down!

37:09.025 --> 37:12.002
- Chase, are you all right?
- Yeah.

37:12.098 --> 37:13.986
Give me your phone.

37:20.323 --> 37:23.076
C.T.U.

37:23.172 --> 37:24.996
This is Jack Bauer.
Patch me through to Almeida now.

37:25.092 --> 37:28.164
- Right away.
- What's going on, Jack?

37:28.260 --> 37:31.556
We do not have the virus.
I repeat: We do not have the virus.

37:31.652 --> 37:34.853
The cylinder Ramon was carrying was rigged
with a bomb. Amador must have switched it.

37:34.949 --> 37:37.573
- Do we have a position on him?
- Delta's on him, Jack. He won't get far.

37:37.669 --> 37:41.252
It must have been Amador's original plan,
which means he has a prearranged escape route.

37:41.348 --> 37:43.973
- Please advise Delta team.
- We're on him, Jack.

37:44.069 --> 37:47.205
Tony, Nina Myers is out there too.

37:47.302 --> 37:49.510
- Any chance she was involved in this?
- No, the bomb was meant for her.

37:49.606 --> 37:53.478
Delta has Amador pinned.
They're two kilometers west of you, Jack.

37:53.606 --> 37:56.710
Copy that. We're moving.
Chase, get your team ready.

37:56.806 --> 37:59.399
Two clicks to the west.
Split the road.

38:02.248 --> 38:04.136
Copy, Delta 3.

38:35.979 --> 38:37.802
Get out of the vehicle, now!

38:42.955 --> 38:45.579
Hands in the air!

38:58.541 --> 39:00.910
Move a muscle, you're dead!

39:05.262 --> 39:08.557
Very slowly, get on the ground!

39:11.309 --> 39:13.486
Do it now!

39:50.962 --> 39:52.818
Go.

40:16.533 --> 40:20.661
Tony, the Delta unit's been taken out.
Amador's escaped.

40:20.757 --> 40:23.573
- Amador's cell phone signal
just went completely dead.
- Jack.

40:25.013 --> 40:27.542
- "Jack, come in."
- Yeah, this is Bauer.

40:27.638 --> 40:30.550
Amador ambushed Delta 3.
I repeat: Amador ambushed Delta 3.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.015
- It was a setup.
- Do you have a position?

40:33.111 --> 40:35.383
Negative. We were tracking him
by his cell phone signal.

40:35.478 --> 40:37.783
- We lost it when the ambush happened.
- What about satellite?

40:37.879 --> 40:41.046
No. There's no visual satellite coverage
of this area at this time, Jack.

40:41.142 --> 40:43.575
Son of a bitch.
Copy that.

40:43.703 --> 40:46.391
Delta 3's been taken out.
They don't have a position on Amador.

40:46.488 --> 40:49.239
- What do you wanna do?
- We gotta find Nina.

40:49.335 --> 40:51.704
Take your team up to the high ground.
I'll cover down here.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.624
Okay.
You guys, point.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.544
I'll flank you.
