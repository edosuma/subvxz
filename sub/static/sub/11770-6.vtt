AND PARTICULARLY THE END,
WHAT I'D LIKE TO
GET INTO MORE QUICKLY

01:45.400 --> 01:46.800
IS THE THREAT
OF THE VIOLENCE.

01:46.833 --> 01:49.133
OKAY, OKAY,

01:53.567 --> 01:55.567
TAKE IT OUT OF MY POCKET,
HOLD UP HIS BALLS.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.567
THE BALLS
WILL NEVER READ.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.600
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
READ AS WELL.

01:57.633 --> 01:58.967

DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING ?

02:10.333 --> 02:11.567

OF THE VIOLENCE, OKAY ?

02:13.833 --> 02:15.100
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT,

02:15.133 --> 02:16.467
IF THIS GUY SAYS SOMETHING
TO YOU, YOU SHOULD SLAP HIM.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.800

02:17.833 --> 02:19.467

ONE RIGHT AFTER THE OTHER.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.067
SAME SLATE.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.667
WE GET THE ENERGY BETTER
ON THE SECOND TAKE THAT WAY.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.100
YOU KNOW, "SEINFELD" WE DID
TWO TAKES AND WE WERE DONE.

02:37.133 --> 02:38.567
WE'RE JUST GETTING INTO IT,
IT'S RICH.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.267
IT'S GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
EVERY TIME YOU DO IT.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.467
ALRIGHT, TRY AND WATCH
THIS ONE, OKAY ?

02:41.500 --> 02:43.100
NO, I WAS GONNA WATCH,

02:43.133 --> 02:44.433

FROM THE EAR PHONES.

02:44.467 --> 02:45.767
WELL, THEN CUT IT
OR SOMETHING.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.667
NO, YOU WERE GOING WOW,

02:47.700 --> 02:48.867
I'M NOT GONNA

02:48.900 --> 02:50.433
ALRIGHT.

02:53.533 --> 02:54.500

02:54.533 --> 02:55.300

SAYING TO YOU ?

02:57.933 --> 02:59.200
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW.

02:59.233 --> 03:00.800
HE HAS THIS LITTLE
WAY OF TALKING TO ME

03:00.833 --> 03:01.900
WHERE IT'S SUBTLE
BUT THE...

03:01.933 --> 03:02.867
HE DOESN'T LIKE IT ?

03:02.900 --> 03:04.767
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.267
DID MY FATHER CALL ?

03:07.300 --> 03:08.967
OH, NO, HE HASN'T
CALLED YET.

03:09.067 --> 03:12.567
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S STILL EARLY IN L.A.

03:14.067 --> 03:18.100
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE HASN'T
CALLED ME BACK, DO YOU KNOW ?

03:18.133 --> 03:19.667
MY MOTHER'S SICK,
HE SHOULD REALLY CALL ME BACK,

03:19.700 --> 03:20.267
I DON'T GET IT.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.733
I KNOW, I KNOW.

03:21.767 --> 03:24.667
IT'S JUST HARD TO TAKE ANYTHING
YOU SAY SERIOUSLY RIGHT NOW.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.967
YOU JUST LOOK CRAZY.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.833

SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL ?

05:25.433 --> 05:27.800
YEAH, WELL,
NOT NOW, NOT NOW.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.233

TO BOTHER YOU.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.100
YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.

05:36.133 --> 05:39.567
SHE SAID,
DON'T BOTHER HIM.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.733
HE'S IN NEW YORK
AND LET HIM ENJOY HIMSELF.

05:42.767 --> 05:43.633
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO SPOIL YOUR TRIP.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.500
BUT, SHE'S NOT
IN THE HOSPITAL NOW.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.467

WELL, IN A WAY.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.500
SHE DID WARN ME.

05:51.533 --> 05:56.067
SHE SAID IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO ME, DON'T BOTHER LARRY.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.200
BECAUSE HE'S IN NEW YORK
AND HE WANTS TO ENJOY IT.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.067
SO THEN,
AFTER A DAY OR TWO,

06:01.067 --> 06:03.600
NOBODY GOES ON FOREVER
AND EVER AND EVER.

06:03.633 --> 06:06.500

TO TELL ME MY MOTHER DIED ?

06:51.900 --> 06:54.133
THE LAST WORDS SHE SAID TO ME,
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME,

06:54.167 --> 06:55.633
YOU DON'T BOTHER LARRY.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.300

07:23.900 --> 07:25.667
PERHAPS HAD
I BEEN INFORMED,

07:25.700 --> 07:29.100
I MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO ATTEND MY MOTHER'S FUNERAL.

07:29.133 --> 07:30.933
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL,
VERY NICE.

07:30.967 --> 07:35.433
VERY WELL ATTENDED,
RABBI SPOKE BEAUTIFULLY.

07:35.467 --> 07:37.067
LIKE A FRIEND.

07:37.100 --> 07:41.233
I NOTICED YOU CALLED ANDY
IN NEW YORK, AND HE FLEW IN.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.167
YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T SAY
NOT TO CALL ANDY.

07:43.200 --> 07:47.800
SHE SAID NOT TO CALL YOU,
THAT'S ALL SHE EVER SAID.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.667
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME
WHEN YOU WERE THERE ?

07:49.700 --> 07:51.633
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE
IF YOU CALLED.

07:51.667 --> 07:54.567
YOU KNOW, I WAS BUSY,
ANDY, I COULDN'T SEE YOU.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.233
NO, NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT, JUST CALL ME.

07:57.267 --> 07:59.633
I FIGURE IF YOU'RE IN TOWN
JUST CALL ME AND SAY,

07:59.667 --> 08:01.433
OH, I DON'T NEED TO SEE YOU,
I DON'T NEED TO COME VISIT.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.433
I KNOW, BUT WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE ?

08:02.467 --> 08:03.900
I COULD CALL YOU
WHEN I'M IN L.A.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.300
I DON'T SEE
THE LOGIC TO IT.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.733
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

08:06.767 --> 08:08.367
DON'T BE A PUTZ,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.967
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ?

08:11.067 --> 08:12.200
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND ?

08:12.233 --> 08:14.800
IF YOU GO TO FLORIDA, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA CALL AUNT CHER ?

08:14.833 --> 08:15.967
NOT NECESSARILY.

08:16.067 --> 08:19.300
OH, YOU COME TO TOWN,
YOU GIVE ME A CALL.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.600
IF I CAN'T SEE YOU
THERE'S NO POINT IN CALLING.

08:21.633 --> 08:24.967
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU, DON'T,
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU ?

08:25.067 --> 08:28.467
TWO PEOPLE RELATED
TO EACH OTHER,
TWO PEOPLE, TWO COUSINS,

08:28.500 --> 08:29.833
AND YOU'RE
ARGUING THIS WAY ?

08:29.867 --> 08:31.667
OKAY, FORGET, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T CALL YOU IN NEW YORK.

08:31.700 --> 08:32.933
I'M SORRY YOU
DIDN'T EITHER.

08:32.967 --> 08:34.667
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.633
LET ME SHOW YOU WHO WAS
THERE AT THIS FUNERAL.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.833
EVERYBODY WAS THERE,
MY GOODNESS.

08:38.867 --> 08:41.100
YOU KNOW, YOUR
UNCLE HAROLD WAS THERE.

08:41.133 --> 08:44.067
HE TOLD HIS JOKE,
HIS FAMOUS JOKE
THAT HE ALWAYS TELLS.

08:44.067 --> 08:46.167
YEAH, YEAH, ABOUT THE TEMPLE,
I KNOW, I KNOW, YEAH.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.800
YEAH, YEAH, ABE LINCOLN,
HE'S JEWISH.

08:47.833 --> 08:50.233
AND THE FOOD
WAS VERY GOOD.

08:50.267 --> 08:51.567
THE FOOD THE FIRST NIGHT
WAS NOT SO GOOD.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.533
IT WAS JUST DELI.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.133
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
PEOPLE BROUGHT OVER,

08:54.167 --> 08:57.067
WE STILL GOT SOME STUFF
IN THE FRIDGE, IT'S DELICIOUS.

08:57.067 --> 08:58.600
YES, WE HAVE A LOT
OF HARD-BOILED EGGS.

08:58.633 --> 09:00.067
AND THE EULOGY
WAS NICE ?

09:00.067 --> 09:00.967
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

09:01.067 --> 09:02.567
TAKE A LOOK AT
HOW WONDERFUL.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.533
A LOT OF PEOPLE
TURNED OUT.

09:04.567 --> 09:07.333
"BEAUTIFUL SERVICE,
SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

09:07.367 --> 09:08.767
WHERE'S LARRY ?"

09:15.433 --> 09:19.133
THE SESSONS CALLED
TO SEND THEIR CONDOLENCES.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.600
WHO ELSE CALLED ?

09:20.633 --> 09:21.900
YOU KNOW,
WE DON'T HAVE TO...

09:21.933 --> 09:23.400
WELL, NO, WHO CALLED ?

09:23.433 --> 09:25.233
MICHAEL ADLER CALLED.

09:25.267 --> 09:29.767
AND HE WANTS TO HAVE LUNCH
WITH YOU, UH...

09:29.800 --> 09:32.300
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THIS GUY
IN ABOUT FIVE YEARS.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.767
OH, WHAT DOES HE WANT
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH ME FOR ?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.400
I DON'T KNOW.

09:35.433 --> 09:39.533
CARUSO'S CALLED,
YOUR SUIT IS READY.

09:39.567 --> 09:42.533
WHICH IS ACTUALLY GOOD
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT

09:42.567 --> 09:45.233
FOR JULIE BLUM'S
BAT MITZVAH.

09:45.267 --> 09:47.967
AND THE MANDELLS ARE--

09:48.067 --> 09:50.433
OH, THAT BAT MITZVAH,
OH, GOD.

09:50.467 --> 09:51.833
IS THERE
ANYTHING WORSE ?

09:51.867 --> 09:53.833
CAN YOU THINK OF
ANYTHING WORSE ?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.133
GO AHEAD, WHAT ELSE ?

09:57.167 --> 10:01.633
AND THE MANDELLS WANT
TO CONFIRM DINNER ON SATURDAY.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.700
OKAY.

10:02.733 --> 10:06.367
NO, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.000
CANCEL IT.

10:08.033 --> 10:09.933
NO DINNER WITH--

10:09.967 --> 10:11.833
NO, CAN'T DO THAT.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.000
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO TELL THEM ?

10:13.033 --> 10:14.833
I DON'T CARE, TELL THEM
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

10:14.867 --> 10:16.233
OKAY.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.133
HI.

10:21.167 --> 10:24.533
MARY, HI,
IT'S CHERYL DAVID.

10:24.567 --> 10:28.500
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO DINNER ON SATURDAY.

10:28.533 --> 10:31.533
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO SAY, BUT...

10:31.567 --> 10:34.300
LARRY'S MOTHER
JUST PASSED AWAY.

10:34.333 --> 10:38.567
AND WE'RE JUST GOING
TO TAKE SOME TIME WITH THAT.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.167
OKAY, THANK YOU.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.200
OKAY, B'BYE.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.967
WHAT DID SHE SAY ?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.300
SHE SAID SHE'S VERY SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

10:48.333 --> 10:49.900
REALLY ?

10:49.933 --> 10:51.933
YEAH, AND SHE
COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD.

10:51.967 --> 10:53.400
HMPH.

10:54.267 --> 10:56.100
MICHAEL.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.467
LARRY DAVID.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.767
PRETTY GOOD.

10:59.800 --> 11:04.367
I'D LOVE TO,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.767
MY MOM DIED.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.533
YEAH.

11:08.567 --> 11:12.533
SO, I'M JUST NOT GONNA
BE DOING MUCH FOR A WHILE.

11:14.167 --> 11:16.267
OKAY, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.600
AS SOON AS
I GET IT TOGETHER.

11:18.633 --> 11:19.800
HI.

11:19.833 --> 11:21.633
IT'S LARRY DAVID.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.067
HEY, I'LL BET JULIE'S
PRETTY EXCITED

11:24.067 --> 11:25.833

BAT MITZVAH, HUH ?

11:25.867 --> 11:30.100
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

11:31.267 --> 11:32.500
WELL...

11:32.533 --> 11:34.367
MY MOTHER DIED.

11:34.400 --> 11:38.067
TELL JULIE GOOD LUCK,
SORRY I CAN'T BE THERE.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.567
AND MAZEL TOV.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.100
YOU TOO, DARLING.

11:44.867 --> 11:49.167
LARRY, HOW DID YOU EVER LAND
THIS ROLE IN THIS FILM ?

11:49.200 --> 11:51.333
IT'S LIKE
UNBELIEVABLE TO ME.

11:51.367 --> 11:54.600
I MEAN, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU,
BUT HOW DID THAT HAPPEN ?

11:54.633 --> 11:58.500
HE SAW ME AT THE...

11:58.533 --> 12:00.067
AT THE IMPROV
SCREAMING AT THE AUDIENCE

12:00.067 --> 12:02.333
ONE NIGHT IN NEW YORK.

12:02.367 --> 12:03.133
YOU MEAN AGES AGO ?

12:03.167 --> 12:04.433
YEAH, AGES AGO.

12:04.467 --> 12:05.600
AND HE REMEMBERED THAT ?

12:05.633 --> 12:08.200
AND HE REMEMBERED THAT
BECAUSE I WAS HAVING IT OUT

12:08.233 --> 12:09.967
WITH THIS GUY IN THE AUDIENCE,
AND HE THOUGHT, LIKE,

12:10.067 --> 12:13.067
I COULD PLAY THIS TOUGH JEW,
I DON'T KNOW, IT WAS WEIRD.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.400
CONGRATULATIONS.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.100
THANK YOU.

12:15.133 --> 12:16.833
FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE.

12:16.867 --> 12:19.200
MAYBE I SHOULD HANG OUT BY
HIS HOUSE AND SCREAM AND YELL.

12:19.233 --> 12:20.567
NO, THAT'S GREAT.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.900
SPEAKING OF SCREAMING
AND YELLING, YOU KNOW,

12:21.933 --> 12:24.367
I'M TRYING TO CALM DOWN
A LITTLE BIT.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.167
SO I DECIDED,
DON'T MOCK.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.367
I'M GONNA START THIS,
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE,

12:28.400 --> 12:29.600
TO MEDITATE.

12:29.633 --> 12:31.067
YOU KNOW,
I USED TO DO IT.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.067
DID YOU KNOW THAT ?

12:32.100 --> 12:34.067
I VAGUELY REMEMBER.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.167
YEAH, I USED
TO DO IT.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.133
WHAT DO YOU
DO ACTUALLY ?

12:36.167 --> 12:39.200
YOU GET MANTRA,

12:39.233 --> 12:41.067
AND YOU JUST, YOU REPEAT
THIS MANTRA IN YOUR HEAD ?

12:41.067 --> 12:42.067
YOU REPEAT IT ?

12:42.067 --> 12:43.833
YEAH, YOU SAY IT OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.500
WHERE DO YOU GET
THESE MANTRAS ?

12:45.533 --> 12:47.100
I GOT IT FROM
A YOGA INSTRUCTOR.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.633
OH, I'M NOT GONNA,
WHAT DO I HAVE TO,

12:48.667 --> 12:51.367
SIGN UP FOR A YOGA CLASS
OR A MANTRA CLASS ?

12:51.400 --> 12:52.367
YOU COULD SAY
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.067
YOU COULD GIVE YOURSELF
YOUR OWN MANTRA.

12:54.067 --> 12:57.067
HEY, YOU WANT A MANTRA,
I'LL GIVE YOU A MANTRA.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.700

13:07.233 --> 13:09.333
IS THAT ALLOWED ?

13:09.367 --> 13:11.167
YEAH, WHO'S GONNA
STOP US ?

13:11.200 --> 13:13.567

13:14.833 --> 13:16.067
WHAT IS YOUR MANTRA ?

13:16.100 --> 13:17.700

OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.733

HALF AN HOUR, JI...

13:36.067 --> 13:37.767

OH, SHIT.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.200
OH, THIS GUY,
IT'S WINDELL.

13:39.233 --> 13:40.267
HE SPOTTED ME.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.567
OH, HE'S GONNA WANT
TO DO A STOP AND CHAT.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.633
DON'T, DON'T,
DON'T GO, DON'T GO.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.833
OH, MY GOD,

13:44.867 --> 13:45.800
OH, WHAT A FUCK.

13:45.833 --> 13:47.600
I GOT A LOT OF
SHOPPING TO DO.

13:47.633 --> 13:48.933
HAVE A BLAST.

13:48.967 --> 13:50.967
HEY, LARRY.
HEY, ED.

13:51.067 --> 13:53.367
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
WHAT A SURPRISE.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.800
GOOD PLACE,
ISN'T IT ?

13:54.833 --> 13:57.933
YEAH, WE'RE CLOTHES SHOPPING
AND I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.600
YOU KNOW, LITTLE DELEE,
"THE PRINCESS".

14:00.633 --> 14:02.900
SHE'S HOLDING UP
THESE TWO THINGS.

14:02.933 --> 14:04.733
WHICH MAKES ME LOOK
MORE GROWN UP, DADDY ?

14:04.767 --> 14:09.267
YOU KNOW...

14:09.300 --> 14:10.300
MY MOTHER...

14:10.333 --> 14:11.767
JUST DIED.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.833
OH, LARRY,
I'M SO SORRY.

14:14.867 --> 14:17.167
I KIND OF NEED TO BE ALONE
WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.

14:17.200 --> 14:21.100
OH, ABSOLUTELY, JEEZ,
OH, BLESS YOUR HEART.

14:21.133 --> 14:22.833
OUR THOUGHTS
ARE WITH YOU.

14:22.867 --> 14:24.800
YEAH, YEAH.
THANK YOU.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.067
EXCUSE ME.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.600
YEP ?

14:46.633 --> 14:49.600
I'M LOOKING FOR MY MOTHER'S
GRAVE, ADELLE DAVID.

14:49.633 --> 14:51.400
SHE WAS JUST BURIED.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.833
UH, YEAH, YEAH.

14:52.867 --> 14:55.467
I THINK IT'S RIGHT OVER,
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
RIGHT OVER THERE.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.767
YEAH, SHE GOT MOVED,
SPECIAL SECTION.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.767
WELL, WHAT'S
SPECIAL SECTION ?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.800
YOU'D BETTER TALK
TO THE GENERAL MANAGER.

15:02.833 --> 15:06.133
TAKE A RIGHT DOWN HERE AND IT'S
THE FIRST BUILDING ON THE RIGHT.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.200
MY MOTHER WAS MOVED
TO A SPECIAL SECTION ?

15:15.233 --> 15:18.400
YES, EVIDENTLY
YOU WERE OUT OF TOWN.

15:18.433 --> 15:21.100
WELL, I WOULD'VE BEEN HERE,
BUT I WASN'T INFORMED ABOUT IT.

15:21.133 --> 15:22.400
WELL, OBVIOUSLY.

15:22.433 --> 15:26.067
WE HAVE A SECTION RESERVED
FOR PEOPLE WHO...

15:26.067 --> 15:28.433
WELL, WHO JUST DON'T
QUALIFY FOR

15:28.467 --> 15:30.200
THE INTERMIT
CONSECRATED GROUND.

15:30.233 --> 15:36.067
IT'S A PLACE WHERE WE PUT
THE VILLAINS, THE SUICIDES,

15:36.067 --> 15:38.900
THE GENTILES WHO ARE
FROM MIXED MARRIAGES...

15:38.933 --> 15:40.467
OKAY, OKAY.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.100
THIS IS A HORRENDOUS
MISTAKE, OKAY ?

15:43.133 --> 15:44.500
LET ME EXPLAIN,
PLEASE.

15:44.533 --> 15:49.233
WHEN SHAMASH EXAMINED HER,
HE FOUND THAT SHE HAD A TATTOO

15:49.267 --> 15:51.667
ON THE, UH...

15:51.700 --> 15:53.167
TATTOO ?

15:53.200 --> 15:54.267
MY MOTHER
HAD A TATTOO ?

15:54.300 --> 15:55.667
YES, SIR.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.467
IT'S ON THE RIGHT CHEEK OF HER
RIGHT BUTTOCK IF YOU WILL.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.333
MY MOTHER HAD A TATTOO
ON HER ASS ?

16:03.367 --> 16:05.900
ON HER RIGHT BUTTOCK,
YES, SIR, UH, NOW...

16:05.933 --> 16:09.667
SO, WHAT IF SHE DID
HAVE A TATTOO, SO WHAT ?

16:09.700 --> 16:12.833
ACCORDING TO LABIDICUS,
YOU SHALL NOT MAKE ANY GASHES

16:12.867 --> 16:15.867
IN YOUR FLESH FOR THE DEAD,
NOR INCISE YOURSELF.

16:15.900 --> 16:19.100
IN OTHER WORDS, TO ADORN
ONESELF IN SUCH A MANNER,

16:19.133 --> 16:21.800
WAS FOUND BY NOMAMEDES
MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS AGO

16:21.833 --> 16:26.933
OF COURSE, TO BE AN OFFENSE
WHICH WOULD DISQUALIFY

16:26.967 --> 16:29.733
SUCH A PERSON FROM BURIAL
IN CONSECRATED GROUND.

16:29.767 --> 16:33.433
OKAY.

16:33.467 --> 16:36.633
LOOK, I WASN'T HERE,
I SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.300
MY FATHER, FOR SOME
REASON DIDN'T CALL ME.

16:38.333 --> 16:39.833
YOUR DAD WAS HERE.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.233
IF I WAS HERE, THIS NEVER
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

16:41.267 --> 16:45.067
NOW, SIR, I'M HERE NOW
AND I'D LIKE TO RECTIFY THIS.

16:45.067 --> 16:48.200
I'D LIKE TO GET HER
WHERE SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE,

16:48.233 --> 16:49.700
WHERE WE PAID
FOR HER PLOT.

16:49.733 --> 16:52.167
NOW, IF THERE WAS SOME
YOUTHFUL INDISCRETION,

16:52.200 --> 16:54.633
AND SHE GOT THIS TATTOO,
WHICH I STILL CAN'T EVEN

16:54.667 --> 16:57.367
HARDLY BELIEVE MY EARS
WHEN YOU EVEN TELL ME THIS.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.067
BUT OKAY, SAY SHE DOES HAVE
THIS TATTOO OVER THERE.

17:01.067 --> 17:04.767
YOU KNOW,
SO, COME ON.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.100
SO WHAT ?

17:06.133 --> 17:08.433
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO, SIR.

17:08.467 --> 17:11.167
THE LAW IS THE LAW.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.067
THAT'S TWO THINGS
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

17:19.067 --> 17:22.467
ALRIGHT, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY, WHAT CAN I DO ?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.367
WELL, WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO

17:23.400 --> 17:24.667
ABOUT THIS
SPECIAL SECTION THING ?

17:24.700 --> 17:26.667
WE CAN'T
KEEP HER THERE.

17:26.700 --> 17:27.967
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

17:28.067 --> 17:30.667
WELL, THAT'S TRUE,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.567
BUT THEY HAVE
THIS SPECIAL SECTION.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.500
IT'S THE STUPIDEST, STUPIDEST
THING I EVER HEARD OF.

17:34.533 --> 17:35.500
I AGREE WITH YOU TOTALLY.

17:35.533 --> 17:37.067
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
ANYTHING SO INSANE.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.833
I HAVE HEARD OF IT.

17:38.867 --> 17:41.333
SHE WOULD BE SICK
TO HER STOMACH IF SHE KNEW.

17:41.367 --> 17:42.867
YES, SHE WOULD
BE UPSET.

17:42.900 --> 17:46.100
YOU KNOW WHAT, BOTTOM LINE IS,
SHE'D BE SICK TO HER STOMACH.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.533
WHEN DID YOU GET
THIS TATTOO ?

17:47.567 --> 17:50.333
OH, THE TATTOO, WELL,
WE WERE JUST MARRIED.

17:50.367 --> 17:52.467
WE WALKED DOWN
THE BOARDWALK OVER THERE.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.700
SHE SAW A TATTOO PARLOR.

17:53.733 --> 17:54.867
SHE SAID,
HEY, LET'S DO IT.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.400
YOUR PARENTS
HAD TATTOOS.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.500
WITH OUR NAMES.

17:58.533 --> 18:01.433
THAT WAS AN EPIC
WORDS OF LOVE.

18:01.467 --> 18:02.967
A REAL SHOW OF LOVE.

18:03.067 --> 18:06.267
I MEAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE,
MY PARENTS MAKING LOVE.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.900
I CAN'T IMAGINE
YOU MAKING LOVE.

18:08.933 --> 18:09.967
WELL, WOW.

18:10.067 --> 18:11.467
HA-HA.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.700
WELL, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

18:12.733 --> 18:14.067
WELL, THANK YOU.

18:14.067 --> 18:15.433
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:15.467 --> 18:16.167
THANK YOU, HONEY.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.067
SO, WHAT'S FOR DINNER ?

18:17.100 --> 18:18.067
TURKEY.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.400
AH, NO, I HAD
TURKEY FOR LUNCH.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.133
OH, WELL...

18:23.167 --> 18:25.133
IT'S ALRIGHT,
IT'S OKAY.

18:25.167 --> 18:28.100
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON THAT TURKEY.

18:28.133 --> 18:30.167
I'LL TAKE
WHATEVER YOU HAVE.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.600
THANK YOU, NED.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.300
BAD CALL, HUH ?

18:35.333 --> 18:36.700
HAVING TURKEY
FOR LUNCH ?

18:36.733 --> 18:38.533
WELL, WHO KNEW ?
I DIDN'T KNOW.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.067
YOU DOUBLED UP.

18:40.067 --> 18:42.933
WHAT AM I GONNA DO,
ORDER CHINESE FOOD IN L.A. ?

18:42.967 --> 18:47.067
WHY, YOU CAN'T ORDER
CHINESE FOOD IN L.A. ?

18:47.067 --> 18:48.467
THERE'S NO GOOD
CHINESE FOOD IN L.A.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.167
RIGHT, 'CAUSE ALL THE GOOD
CHINESE COOKS WENT TO NEW YORK.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.933
A COUNTRY OF
ONE BILLION PEOPLE,

18:52.967 --> 18:56.200
THEY COULDN'T SEND OVER
ONE GOOD CHEF TO LOS ANGELES.

18:56.233 --> 18:58.133
HOW CAN YOU
POSSIBLY BE ARGUING

18:58.167 --> 19:01.400
THE QUALITY OF GOOD CHINESE FOOD
IN L.A. VERSUS NEW YORK ?

19:01.433 --> 19:02.867
ALRIGHT, FINE.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.100
YOU KNOW WHAT,
COME HERE, COME HERE.

19:13.100 --> 19:16.733
ALRIGHT,
HERE'S MY IDEA, OKAY.

19:16.767 --> 19:20.367
I WANT TO GET,
I WANT TO MOVE HER BODY.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.400
I WANT TO MOVE THE BODY
TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE,

19:24.433 --> 19:27.367
BECAUSE MOM WOULD NOT WANT
TO BE THERE, IT'S NOT RIGHT.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.433
I FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT IT.

19:29.467 --> 19:30.767
AND, UM...

19:30.800 --> 19:32.567
HOW DO YOU MOVE,
HOW DO YOU MOVE HER ?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.833
I'M GONNA TRY
AND PAY OFF THE GRAVE DIGGER.

19:34.867 --> 19:36.667
WOW.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.500
THAT DOES NOT SOUND
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

19:38.533 --> 19:40.900
I THINK IT SOUNDS
FANTASTIC.

19:40.933 --> 19:43.767
IT'S NOT DANGEROUS BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING,

19:43.800 --> 19:46.100
BUT PAY OFF THE GRAVE DIGGER,
AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO DO.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.567
I THINK I CAN DO IT.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.300
IF HE TAKES THE MONEY, FINE,
IF NOT, WELL, AT LEAST I TRIED.

19:50.333 --> 19:51.800
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET
THIS MAN TO DIG IT UP ?

19:51.833 --> 19:53.767
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK IF YOU
OFFER SOMEBODY ENOUGH MONEY,

19:53.800 --> 19:55.767
THEY'LL DO IT.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.567
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
WE TRIED EVERYTHING WE COULD.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.200
WE TALKED TO THESE PEOPLE,
THEY WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT.

19:59.233 --> 20:01.967
IF YOU CAN PAY THIS GUY OFF,
I SAY GO, GO DO IT.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.133
I'D LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE.

20:04.167 --> 20:05.133
I'D LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE
A FEW DOLLARS.

20:05.167 --> 20:07.033
YOU'RE NOT
CONTRIBUTING IN.

20:07.067 --> 20:08.533
YOU MEAN THIS WHOLE
TATTOO THING IS JUST...

20:08.567 --> 20:11.233
I AGREE WITH YOU,
I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY.

20:11.267 --> 20:12.600
HONEST TO GOD,
I THINK IT'S A GREAT...

20:12.633 --> 20:13.700
I THINK
IT'S TERRIBLE.

20:13.733 --> 20:15.200
QUIET, QUIET.

20:15.233 --> 20:17.033
WE'LL DO IT.

20:17.067 --> 20:18.267
NO, I THINK
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.967
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.200
SCARY IDEA.

20:22.600 --> 20:26.367
( Lewis thinking )
Ji ya, ji ya, ji ya.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.800
( phone ringing )

20:38.233 --> 20:39.567
YEAH, WHO IS IT ?

20:39.600 --> 20:41.400
IT'S ME.

20:41.433 --> 20:43.200
YEAH.
L.D. ?

20:43.233 --> 20:44.967
I CAN'T, I, I...

20:45.000 --> 20:47.200
What's the matter,
huh ?

20:47.233 --> 20:50.467
I'M MEDITATING.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.867
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE KIDDING.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.700
NO, I'M JUST GETTING INTO THIS
AND IT'S STARTING TO WORK.

20:54.733 --> 20:56.267
I JUST DIDN'T, I FORGOT
TO TURN THE PHONE OFF.

20:56.300 --> 20:57.533
I'M JUST
SO PISSED OFF.

20:57.567 --> 20:58.733
OH, I'M SORRY.

20:58.767 --> 21:00.733
ACTUALLY, THAT'S KIND OF
WHAT I'M CALLING ABOUT.

21:00.767 --> 21:01.733
About what ?

21:01.767 --> 21:03.367
I WAS CALLING
ABOUT THE MANTRA.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.233
WHAT ABOUT
THE MANTRA ?

21:05.267 --> 21:07.067
IT'S GOOD BY THE WAY,
IT'S WORKING.

21:07.100 --> 21:11.633
I HAVE TO CALL TO SEE,
MAYBE I COULD GET IT BACK.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.900
GET IT BACK ?

21:13.933 --> 21:16.067
WHAT IS THAT,
YOU GAVE IT TO ME ?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.767
BUT I CHANGED MY MIND,
I'D LIKE TO GET IT BACK.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.267
YOU CAN'T BE
AN EAST INDIAN-GIVER.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.467
WELL, I KNOW, I HAD IT FIRST,
KIND OF, YOU KNOW.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.900
Yeah, you did,
but you let me have it.

21:25.933 --> 21:28.067
AND NOW IT'S PART
OF MY WHOLE BEING.

21:28.067 --> 21:31.100
MY ESSENCE SCREAMS
OF THIS MANTRA.

21:31.133 --> 21:32.300
AND IT'S BEEN WORKING.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.767
You know, really Larry,
it's not fair.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.500
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
SPLITTING IT WITH ME ?

21:36.533 --> 21:40.133
SPLITTING IT, WHAT IS THIS,
A TIME SHARE IN THE HAMPTONS ?

21:40.167 --> 21:41.533
You don't
split a mantra.

21:41.567 --> 21:44.267
WELL, WHO SAID YOU CAN'T
SPLIT A MANTRA, WHY CAN'T YOU ?

21:44.300 --> 21:47.633
IT STRIKES ME AS BEING A TAD,
YOU KNOW, HOMOSEXUAL.

21:47.667 --> 21:48.667
IT'S NOT A GAY THING.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.267
No, I mean,
we're not homosexual.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.767
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME,
I'M NOT A HOMOSEXUAL.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.133
I KNOW I'M NOT
A HOMOSEXUAL.

21:54.167 --> 21:56.433
I KNOW, BUT I'M REALLY HAVING
A DIFFICULT TIME GIVING IT BACK.

21:56.467 --> 21:58.833
I MEAN, YOU DID A NICE TURN,
AND, YOU KNOW,

21:58.867 --> 22:00.800
AND NOW, YOU'RE RENEGING,
YOU KNOW ?

22:00.833 --> 22:03.600
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,
MY MOTHER JUST DIED.

22:03.633 --> 22:07.500
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

22:07.533 --> 22:08.533
Alright, fine.

22:08.567 --> 22:10.500
YEAH ?

22:10.533 --> 22:12.167
OH, FABULOUS.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.200
DON'T EVEN THINK
TWICE ABOUT IT.

22:13.233 --> 22:15.333
Alright, great,
so we'll split it.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.333
YEAH, ALRIGHT,
OKAY, NO PROBLEM.

22:17.367 --> 22:18.900
ALRIGHT, MAN, BYE.

22:18.933 --> 22:20.400
WHO'S THAT ?

22:20.433 --> 22:22.367
LEWIS.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.167
LEWIS, HOW'S LEWIS ?

22:24.200 --> 22:25.367
HE'S GOOD.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.767
YEAH ?

22:26.800 --> 22:29.167
I AM EXHAUSTED.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.433
OH, OKAY.

22:31.467 --> 22:34.167
GOODNIGHT, HONEY.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.533
GOODNIGHT ?

22:35.567 --> 22:37.900
REALLY,
GOODNIGHT ?

22:37.933 --> 22:39.400
GOODNIGHT.

22:41.967 --> 22:44.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

22:44.500 --> 22:45.333
WHAT AM I DOING ?

22:45.367 --> 22:47.533
NO, NO, PLEASE.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.967
HONEY, I JUST SHOWERED.

22:49.067 --> 22:51.067
WHAT, SO WHAT, THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S GOOD FOR ME.

22:51.067 --> 22:53.400
I DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING
INTO ALL THAT RIGHT NOW.

22:53.433 --> 22:54.500
WHAT, WHY NOT ?

22:54.533 --> 22:55.667
I'M VERY TIRED.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.633
YOU'RE KIDDING.
NOPE.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.367
REALLY ?
MM-HMM.

23:02.167 --> 23:07.433
YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST THAT I'VE
BEEN GOING THROUGH A ROUGH TIME.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.567
WELL, WITH
MY MOTHER AND ALL.

23:12.333 --> 23:15.700
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
A CHANCE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

23:15.733 --> 23:18.800
OH, HONEY.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.667
HEY !

23:27.700 --> 23:29.833
HOW YOU DOING ?

23:29.867 --> 23:32.067
REMEMBER ME ?

23:46.200 --> 23:47.233
ALRIGHT.

23:48.467 --> 23:50.267
MEET ME AT THE GRAVE.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.667
EIGHT O'CLOCK TONIGHT.

23:52.700 --> 23:56.667
YOU BETTER BRING
SOME FRIENDS TO HELP.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.067
HELP WHAT ?

23:58.067 --> 23:59.367
DIG.

24:02.533 --> 24:04.567
ALL THESE STONES
LOOK ALIKE.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.467
COMPLETELY,
COMPLETELY LOST.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.767
WATCH YOUR FEET.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.267
BECAUSE YOU STEP ON ONE OF
THESE THINGS, YOU'LL TRIP...

24:10.300 --> 24:12.833
HEY, OVER HERE.

24:12.867 --> 24:13.933
HEY.

24:13.967 --> 24:16.867
HEY !

24:19.733 --> 24:21.400
YOU'RE LATE.

24:21.433 --> 24:23.900
YEAH, WELL,

24:23.933 --> 24:26.067
WELCOME TO
THE SPECIAL SECTION.

24:26.067 --> 24:27.900
OH, MY GOD.

24:27.933 --> 24:31.267

24:33.633 --> 24:34.233
THANK YOU.

24:34.267 --> 24:37.600
HEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU ?

24:37.633 --> 24:40.867
I ONLY GOT
FOUR SHOVELS.

24:40.900 --> 24:43.533
ASSHOLE.

24:43.567 --> 24:44.567
ALRIGHT.

24:46.267 --> 24:49.833
( music playing )

25:29.167 --> 25:31.100
( David thinking )
Ji ya.

25:31.133 --> 25:33.967
Ji ya.

25:34.067 --> 25:38.867
Ji ya, ji ya, ji ya.

25:38.900 --> 25:42.433
* ji ya, ji ya, ji ya,
I made it out of clay *

25:42.467 --> 25:45.333

25:48.067 --> 25:49.633
( knocking )

25:54.233 --> 25:55.667
WHO IS IT ?

25:55.700 --> 25:57.367
YOUR FRIEND,
RICHARD LEWIS.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.667
OH, RICHIE BOY !

25:59.700 --> 26:02.133
LARRY.

26:02.167 --> 26:03.667
OH, A LITTLE
POP-IN, HUH ?

26:03.700 --> 26:05.067
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT
OF A POP-IN.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.133
NO CALL ?

26:06.167 --> 26:08.700
NO, HAPPY ?

26:08.733 --> 26:12.333
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

26:12.367 --> 26:16.333
THE MANTRA THAT
YOU SO NICELY LENT TO ME,

26:16.367 --> 26:20.233
THAT I SAID,
MAYBE 400,000 TIMES.

26:20.267 --> 26:21.567
JI YA, WHAT, WHAT ?

26:21.600 --> 26:23.467
I FOUND OUT WHAT IT MEANT
FROM SOME CHICK

26:23.500 --> 26:24.967
WHO DOES THIS
MEDITATION STUFF.

26:25.067 --> 26:26.067
WHAT DOES IT MEAN ?

26:26.100 --> 26:28.633
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE JI YA,
