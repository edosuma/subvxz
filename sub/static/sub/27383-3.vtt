00:10.276 --> 00:11.512
You're havin'... Dary?

00:11.545 --> 00:12.613
Breh‐fekst.
Atta boy.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.781
...with your pals
the other day.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.352
You wearin' perfume, bud?

00:19.385 --> 00:20.754
Perfumes is for womens,
good buddy.

00:20.787 --> 00:23.089
He's wearin's the cologne.

00:23.123 --> 00:25.191
It's actually
an eau de toilette.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.728
Eau de toilet.
Eau de dew‐dah‐day.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.730
What's the difference?

00:29.763 --> 00:32.699
Well, a cologne is about
seven's percent's
aromatic essence

00:32.733 --> 00:33.834
that dissolves in alcohols.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.538
Whereas an eau de toilette
is 10% aromatics essences.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.272
There you go.
An eau de toilette like this

00:39.305 --> 00:41.107
will evaporate from
your skin pretty rapidly.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.142
So, you're gonna wanna
load up on it.

00:42.175 --> 00:45.679
You could still take a good
23 to 27% off'er, bud.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.548
You never wears too much
perfumes, Miss Katy's.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.215
And that's
what I appreciate's
about you's.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.451
Let's not.
DARYL:
This eau de toilette is

00:51.484 --> 00:54.555
enchantingly refreshing
on summer days like this.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.157
That may the softest thing
you've ever said, Dary.

00:57.190 --> 00:59.626
No, it isn't.
What is?

00:59.660 --> 01:02.763
"I can't stand harsh metals
against my skin."

01:03.530 --> 01:04.598
They give me a rash.

01:05.532 --> 01:07.701
Oh, I love's pancakes.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.203
ALL: Thank you, ladies.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.538
These are actually crepes.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.339
Pancakes with a French spin.

01:13.373 --> 01:14.274
What's the difference?

01:14.307 --> 01:16.510
Pancake batter has
a rising agent in it.

01:16.543 --> 01:17.711
Baking powder.
There you go.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.179
It makes them
thick and fluffy.

01:19.212 --> 01:22.549
Crepe batter doesn't have
a rising agent in it,
so they're thinner.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.084
Ch‐ch.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.853
All's I know is that these
would be great with some
Elmira's maple syrup.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.855
You's two's could open up
a crepe shop with these.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.290
Wanna know what?
I already told her that.

01:30.323 --> 01:31.825
We call it,
Planet of the Crepes.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.259
Crepe Canaveral.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.395
The Crepe Crusader.
Crepe Winslett's.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.363
Do the Carpets
Match the Crepes?

01:37.397 --> 01:38.665
The Crepe of Things.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.602
Date Crepe.
DAN: I don't know
about that one.

01:41.635 --> 01:44.404
It's Crepes on a Date.
Get your mind outta the gutter.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.739
The Great Es‐Crepe.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.609
Crepe Fear.
Sex, Lies and Video Crepe.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.577
Sadako and the Thousand
Paper Crepes.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.879
Great book...
It's actually pronounced "krep."

01:52.913 --> 01:54.548
Yeah, you guys kind of
butcher our language.

01:54.581 --> 01:55.682
Well, to be fair...

01:55.716 --> 01:56.850
To be fair‐ah...
To be fair...

01:56.883 --> 01:57.918
To be fair‐ah...

01:57.951 --> 01:59.352
To be fair‐ah...

01:59.385 --> 02:02.222
there's folks in France who
think you's guys butcher
your language. So...

02:02.255 --> 02:04.591
ALL: Ooh!

02:04.625 --> 02:05.926
Who gives a crepe!

02:05.959 --> 02:08.161
Wanna know what?
There's pretty good ones
for "krep" as well.

02:08.194 --> 02:09.429
Johnny Crepe.
Holy Crepe.

02:09.462 --> 02:10.496

02:12.533 --> 02:14.300

02:14.334 --> 02:15.468
Crepe Le Pew.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.470

02:21.307 --> 02:22.709
Oh, jeez, I don't knows
about that one.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.477
Will you get off
my dick today?

02:24.511 --> 02:25.646
Led Creppelin.

02:25.679 --> 02:29.415
You know,
if I keeping eatin'
all these crepes...

02:30.584 --> 02:31.818
I might get a crepe worm.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.321
(LAUGHS)

02:37.357 --> 02:39.392
Like a... it's like...

02:39.425 --> 02:41.461
it's like a tapeworm,
but it's having the...

02:41.494 --> 02:43.597
No. Nope.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.166
Wish you weren't so
fuckin' awkward, bud.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.268

Hello.
It's Stewart! He's in tr...

03:40.787 --> 03:42.388

Shocker.

03:42.422 --> 03:47.561
(SOBBING)Yeah.
There's another deh... and he...

03:47.594 --> 03:49.863

Why not?
Because he's a vigi...

Okay. We're coming.
No... yeah.

No, we're not.
Yes, we are.

Yes, we are.

No, we're not.
Dan, get off my dick today.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.022
Sorry, Miss Katy's.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.257
What's the problem, Wayne?

04:17.290 --> 04:20.026
You don't wanna
go to the SPCA
and play with the dogs?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.361
Oh!

04:21.394 --> 04:22.428
What's the matter, Dary?

04:22.462 --> 04:24.765
You don't wanna go
to the food court in the mall

04:24.798 --> 04:27.601
and get a little of everything
to create the perfect meal?

04:27.634 --> 04:28.669
Oh!

04:28.702 --> 04:31.738
And Dan, if,
you get off my dick,

It's drugs!

This is the third note stuck
to the door this week!

05:20.621 --> 05:22.455
Mmm. The grammar's atrocious.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.757
Exceptionally odious.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.559
That's what makes it scary.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.393
They're too hardcore
to proofread.

05:27.427 --> 05:29.362
Hard corny.
(CHUCKLES)

05:29.395 --> 05:30.764
You're so fuckin' funny.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.138
If they don't take the edifice
of their letter seriously,

05:38.171 --> 05:41.007
why would I take
their threat seriously?

05:41.041 --> 05:44.077
One mistake is enough
for you to ignore
the angel of death?

05:44.110 --> 05:45.378
Two.
Two?

05:45.411 --> 05:47.614
Two mistakes!
In two sentences.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.917
Your, versus, you're,
y‐o‐u‐apostrophe r‐e,

05:50.951 --> 05:52.953
is so fucking basic
it's embarrassing.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.522
If you want to say,
"You are dead,"

05:55.556 --> 05:58.424
which this fucking boob
has cheaply attempted,

05:58.458 --> 06:00.661
then you'd want use... you're.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.062
Where is the other mistake?

06:02.095 --> 06:03.830
Omission of the word "of".

06:03.864 --> 06:07.133
(SQUEAKS)
Oh, that may have been
an intentional omission.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.070
Sure, Roald.
He's a man of
exorbitantly few words.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.372
So, my reply...

06:14.040 --> 06:15.108
(SIGHS UNHAPPILY)

06:18.111 --> 06:23.717
"Your threat
is meaningless."

to speak with Stewart

Terry Fox would get

06:51.778 --> 06:53.013
He could start with mine.

a married woman,

Fuck you, Ronzy.
You're a marathon of dope.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.184
Terry Fox ran
3400 miles

07:31.217 --> 07:34.054
in a 143 days on one leg.

07:34.087 --> 07:37.758

he'd be gettin' handy's from
Hiltons and Hadids.

fuckin' light.

If Terry Fox was alive
he'd have an interview show
like Seinfeld.

You mean, Comedians in Cars
Getting Coffee?
Yeah.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.879

If Terry Fox was alive

08:00.046 --> 08:03.049
he'd be smashing
J‐Law and J‐Lo

He'd be boatin'
with Kylie Minogue.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.837

every time you go to merge,

08:23.870 --> 08:25.772
there just happens
to be six in‐breds

08:25.806 --> 08:27.974
merging at the
exact same time?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.010
Come off the ramp,
get your fuckin' foot in it.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.913
Yeah. And then ya got
the wannabe Indie car drivers
who have it right to the rug

08:32.946 --> 08:34.748
who kinda fly's up
behind you and kiss bumpers.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.983
Like, what's your hurry's there
Jimmy Hinchcliffe's?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.251

was the greatest.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.720
Oh, yeah, he was
the fuckin' greatest.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.756
What's their hurry?
They've got a fuckin'
brunch line to go wait in.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.825

08:44.858 --> 08:46.593

08:46.627 --> 08:48.762
Well, now hold on one
fiscal minute here, Wayne.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.898
Pizza, fries, sushis,
Yogen Fruz.

08:51.932 --> 08:52.966
I thought we were
going to the food court.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.668
Of course we are, Dary.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.104
Szechuan, shawarma,
stir fries, Five Guys...

08:58.138 --> 09:01.708
We can't forgets about
Colonels Cajun BBQs and DQs.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.578
Well, there's no way
we're missing Tacos
and Quiznos,

09:04.611 --> 09:06.647
Chipotle and Chick‐fil‐A.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.015
Wayne, we're meetin'
the skids at the club
at around midnight.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.118
That's still a good six
calendar hours away, Katy.
Simmer down.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.621
Yeah, but I still have to go
find something to wear.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.823
Show these city girls
what's up.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.726
All right. Let's split.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.228
You wanna know what?
It's always so tough
sayin' bye to the puppies.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.631
Like they're so cute
you almost don't want to.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.634
That may be the softest thing
you've ever said, big brother.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.735
No, it isn't.
What is?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.806
"How come no one ever
compliments me
on my eyelashes?"

09:35.976 --> 09:38.044
You're paraphrasing.
You fuckin' know it!

09:38.078 --> 09:40.146
Is that what I'm doin'?
What I said was,

09:41.281 --> 09:43.149
"I got real long eyelashes.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.987
"But I'm surprised no one's
ever noticed that."

09:48.221 --> 09:50.891
Gimme a high five...
high five...

09:53.193 --> 09:54.795
(MIMICS DOOR KNOCKING)

09:54.828 --> 09:55.962
Gae?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.798
(MIMICS DOOR KNOCKING)

09:57.831 --> 09:59.232
Roaldy.
Look!

09:59.265 --> 10:01.367
Oh, this is so agitating.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.468
I know. I'm frightened.

10:02.503 --> 10:05.138
I'm referring to
the spelling and
the grammar, Roald.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.873
Gives me
the coldest pricklies.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.843
What have those wordsmiths
assembled for us this segment?

10:10.410 --> 10:12.646
(LAUGHS) How asinine!

10:12.679 --> 10:14.080
They can kiss my asinine.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.381
Oh, that ass is mine...

10:15.415 --> 10:16.382
I'm frightened!

10:16.416 --> 10:18.952
Yet another demeaning
attempt to intimidate.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.654
And this one
even better. Yeah.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.723
I'm pushing the
panic button here,
you guysers.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.991
Don't be such
a jellyfish, Roald!

10:25.025 --> 10:26.960
My slow‐learning,
seven‐year‐old brother

10:26.993 --> 10:30.931
even knows it's,
"If you're... y‐o‐u
apostrophe r‐e,

10:30.964 --> 10:34.300
there... t‐h‐e‐r‐e tonight...

10:34.334 --> 10:35.702
Comma. No period.

10:35.736 --> 10:40.006
It's "I‐t apostrophe s...
on." Period.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.875
I'd have chosen
an exclamation point.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.577
I think you're right.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.879
Past notes haven't
quite landed.
Do you know what I mean?

10:45.912 --> 10:47.748
Yes, sans duress.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.950
They don't exactly have
the tiger by the tail, do they?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.919
Not exactly whipping
the excitement up to
a real fever pitch. No.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.921
They are not.
For a plethora of reasons.

10:54.955 --> 10:58.692
This death note, presumably
the final installment,
it requires urgency.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.160
Some sort of accent,
I would agree.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.029
The exclamation point guides
the reader to approach it
more threateningly.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.131
Like, there's stakes there.
Like, "It's on!"

11:05.165 --> 11:06.332
Right?
Exactly.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.869
As opposed to a period.
Because, if it's me...
It's you.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.304
I read it like... "It's on."

11:11.337 --> 11:13.106
The period leaves the decision
up to the reader.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.875
It does suggest
a more docile read.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.110
There's no room
for ambiguity
in death threats.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.411
Exclamation point?

11:18.444 --> 11:21.281
Yes... Sex‐clamation point.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.019
Oh...
Go stick that on the door!

11:30.924 --> 11:31.925
Alley‐yoop.

11:36.963 --> 11:40.100
(SIGHS) Okay.
Let's clean this shit up
and go back in.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.468
I need to find
something to wear tonight.
Get my hussy on.

11:42.503 --> 11:45.806
Give me five
calendar minutes to digest,
and I'll join ya.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.774
Oh, so you're looking
to find a nice bench

11:47.808 --> 11:49.976
to have a sit down
outside a lingerie store, Dary?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.878
I'd be looking
for a sit down,

11:51.912 --> 11:53.980
won't be no bench though.
Be the throne then, Dary?

11:54.014 --> 11:55.749
Porcelain one. Can confirm.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.084
You should have a sits down
in a public washrooms?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.220
Surprised I'm not having
a sit down in a public
washroom right now.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.387
You's would do such a thing's?

12:01.421 --> 12:02.856
Faster than Greg fuckin' Moore.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.257
How could ya, Dary?

12:04.290 --> 12:06.026
How could you do such a thing's?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.761
Public washrooms is disgusting.

12:07.794 --> 12:10.230
Poo particles is
literally's airborne's.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.967
Oh, ceased mingling
with the peasants again now,
have we, Dan.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.136
Won't find a more
violent environments
on the planet Earth.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.237
Not for my money.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.839
Not for my money either.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.141
Oh, how's the weather up there
in your ivory tower, Wayne?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.309
Well, I'll go in,
just won't have
a sit‐down.

12:23.343 --> 12:26.012
I'll rock one,
like a good old boy.
Not a monster.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.048
Must be nice
to have the option.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.950
Well, I just get
the giggles is all.

12:29.983 --> 12:33.119
Ain't nothin' to giggle about
in a cesspool of fecal matters
and pee‐pees.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.420
Sure there is.
What?

12:34.454 --> 12:37.157
Well... farts.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.126
Ew.
Well, there's nothin' funnier
than a fart.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.562
Except kids
fallin' off bikes maybe.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.097
Fuck, I could watch kids
fall off bikes all fiscal day.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.298
I don't give a shit
about your kids.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.833
DARYL: Oh, yeah,
it's super funny.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.035
You just be standing there,
rocking a piss,

12:49.069 --> 12:51.337
dude will come up
next to you.
Just rip a fart.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.840
How is that funny?
Dude droppin'
his guts like that?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.108
I take's exceptions to it.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.110
Well, you're supposed
to be standing there,

12:57.143 --> 13:00.113
nobody'll say nothing,
you'll be rockin' one,
peacefully.

13:00.146 --> 13:01.848
Then you just rip a fart.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.917
It's not funny's.
It's fuckin' hilarious.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.352
What is your guys
fascination with farts?

13:06.386 --> 13:09.322
Well, you don't know him.
He doesn't know you.

13:09.355 --> 13:11.257
He ain't never heard one
like that before.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.126
Yeah, farts will never
not be funny.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.261
I will never
not laugh at a fart.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.066
There's even a courtesy
aspect of it, too.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.467
Ah, this should be interesting.

13:21.502 --> 13:23.403
Well, like if you go
into a public bathroom,

13:23.436 --> 13:25.271
there's a guy in a stall,

13:25.305 --> 13:26.372
he'll announce his
presence to you.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.574
Like how?

13:27.608 --> 13:29.510
He's sittin' there
and maybe he'll clear
his throat.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.612
Like... (CLEARS THROAT)

13:31.645 --> 13:33.213
That's exactly
how they do it, Dary.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.048
They go... (CLEARS THROAT)

13:35.081 --> 13:37.283
Why would he want to announce
that he's having a sit down?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.419
Well, the first sound
you hear is not a fart.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.954
He's prepping you
for the acoustics.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.589
And how is that courteous?

13:42.623 --> 13:44.991
Well, let's say you're like me,
you get the giggles.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.094
From a fart?
I get the giggles
from a fart, yes.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.063
You're in there,
you're at the urinal,

13:50.096 --> 13:52.298
you hear a fart,
you giggle a wee bit.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.267
Get shaking.
Piss goes everywhere.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.570
How do you think
the pee's particles
gets airborne's?

13:56.603 --> 13:57.971
DARYL: It's weird,

13:58.004 --> 14:00.306
'cause dudes will fart
in front of each other
any day of the week.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.008
Soon as you get
into a public stall,

14:02.042 --> 14:03.510
want to announce
their presence.

14:03.544 --> 14:05.278
Make sure one doesn't
sneak up on ya.

14:05.311 --> 14:06.580
But it's a public bathroom.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.114
You're supposed to hear
those sorts of sounds.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.315
It's just different
in there, Katy.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.884
It's more intimate.
Come off it.

14:10.917 --> 14:13.253
Some dudes want
to announce themselves
by sniffing,

14:13.286 --> 14:14.655
which is not
the right avenue.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.356
Ain't nothin' in there
you wanna be sniffin'.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.491
No, I'm gonna tell ya.
All right, come on, Dary.
Let's go.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.928
You guys should make some
betters efforts to avoid
bacteria's exposures.

14:21.962 --> 14:25.131
Good hygiene is the
only jeans that never
goes out of styles.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.901
Dan, I think that might be
the softest thing
you've ever said.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.970
No, it isn't.
What is?

14:31.605 --> 14:33.574
Okay.

14:33.607 --> 14:36.376
One time my perennials
didn't come in for
the second year,

14:36.409 --> 14:39.045
and you knows perennials
is exposed to live

14:39.079 --> 14:41.081
more than two years.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.448
So, I says,

14:44.084 --> 14:46.119
"I'm so upset
about my perennials."

14:50.090 --> 14:51.157
KATY: Yikes.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.328
Dary...

15:01.434 --> 15:02.903
(FARTS)

15:04.605 --> 15:06.406
(CHUCKLES)

15:10.343 --> 15:12.012
Oy! Oh, girls!

15:12.045 --> 15:13.479
We can help with this.

15:13.514 --> 15:15.015
(SQUEALS)
We don't want these dudes
in the club either.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.584
Thanks, but some hicks are
coming from Letterkenny
and they're taking us home.

15:17.618 --> 15:19.686
(STEWART AND GAE MOANING)

15:19.720 --> 15:21.121
Good luck getting him
away from that.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.288
Sounds like some of that
good fuckin'...

15:22.322 --> 15:24.490
Mmm.
Mmm‐hmm.

15:24.525 --> 15:26.392
(WHISPERING) There may be
animals being harmed in there.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.129
Listen to me.
Some hicks from Letterkenny
aren't gonna do it.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.196
These dudes roll deep.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.332
Take this shit seriously.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.100
You're keeping us safe.
Even though it's not supposed
to be safe 'cause it's drugs.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.236
And we appreciate it.
But you're dealing
on their turf.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.604
They're not gonna stop
'til you're off it.

15:37.638 --> 15:40.574
One way or another.
They do not care.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.675
Look at their spelling.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.510
Dangerous grammar.
Dangerous.

15:43.544 --> 15:44.745
(WHISPERING)
That's what I said.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.614
GAE: Oh, my god,
it's so big, Stewart!

15:47.648 --> 15:49.716
Mmm.
Hmm.

15:49.750 --> 15:52.118
So, how's the
take down tally, boys?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.254
Yeah, boys.
How's the tail town?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.089
Undressin' and progressin'
boys.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.558
Workin' smarter, not harder.

15:57.591 --> 15:58.692
You know what
I'm talking about.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.994
Yeah...
How's the titty tally
on your end, boys.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.563
Suckin' some ya‐yas?

16:02.596 --> 16:04.731
Come on, I get off on it.
Yeah, you handlin' some knocks?

16:04.765 --> 16:06.767
Took down an Austral‐Asian
just last week.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.634
How exotic.

16:07.668 --> 16:10.303
Smashed an Indo‐Laotian
two nights ago.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.705
Festive.
I know.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.273
Ever smashed
an Arctic‐Kuwaiti?

16:15.075 --> 16:16.610
No.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.745
Ever smashed
an Ecuadorian‐Albanian?

16:18.779 --> 16:20.080
'Course.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.282
Ever smashed
a Sierra Leonean‐Saudi?

16:22.315 --> 16:25.051
No. Ever smashed
a Sri Lankan French citizen?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.186
Several.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.454
You ever smashed
a Uruguayan‐Israeli?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.223
What?
How about a Croatian‐Quebecer.

16:31.525 --> 16:32.458
BOTH: Likely.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.161
You ever smashed
a Tibetan‐New Zealander?
No.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.263
How about
a Moroccan‐Hong Konger?
No.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.465
Ever smashed a Cuban‐Uzbek?
Come on.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.535
You ever smashed
a Maltese‐Congolese?

16:41.568 --> 16:43.203
Boys, I think that's a dog.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.105
You ever smashed
a Baltic‐German‐Spaniard?

16:45.138 --> 16:46.406
That's for sure a dog, buddy.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.774
How about
a Baltic‐Russian‐Iraqi?

16:47.808 --> 16:49.409
You've for sure smashed
a Peruvian‐Turk.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.376
Everyone has.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.478
Same way everyone's smashed
a Welsh‐Nigerian.

16:52.513 --> 16:54.347
Gimme a Swedish‐Philipinno
for dinner.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.416
And a Guatemalan‐Slovak
for dessert.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.383
Ah...

16:57.417 --> 16:59.820
Gimme a Tamil‐British
Virgin Islander, Ronzy.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.623
Gimme a Kosovar‐Greenlander,
Daxi.
