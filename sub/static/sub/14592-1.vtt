00:39.101 --> 00:41.536
MAN: Thousands of years ago
in ancient China,

00:41.572 --> 00:43.506
an evil army
of shadow warriors...

00:43.540 --> 00:46.169
terrorized the great city
of Shang-sa.

00:46.211 --> 00:47.906
To save his people,

00:47.946 --> 00:52.441
the good king sacrificed himself
to create a mystical medallion.

00:53.118 --> 00:56.418
Realizing the ultimate powers
of the medallion,

00:56.456 --> 00:58.482
the king split it in half.

00:58.526 --> 01:02.258
To one son,
he gave the power over body;

01:02.297 --> 01:04.891
to the other,
power over the soul.

01:05.567 --> 01:09.095
This is the legend
of the Double Dragon.

01:20.152 --> 01:21.585
Come on! Hyah!

01:25.058 --> 01:26.491
[People screaming]

01:53.227 --> 01:55.024
[Speaking Chinese]

03:04.582 --> 03:08.382
Shuko, Lash. We found it.

03:16.596 --> 03:20.089
MAN: The king knew that together
his sons would be triumphant...

03:20.134 --> 03:22.535
and return peace to the land.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.699
After their victory, the princes
hid the medallions...

03:28.744 --> 03:32.545
to prevent them
from ever being used...for evil.

03:38.190 --> 03:41.057
[Rumbling]

03:41.093 --> 03:43.562
[Rattling]

03:45.565 --> 03:48.967
Afraid of a little aftershock?
Don't be.

03:49.003 --> 03:51.529
They're a...prophecy.

03:53.175 --> 03:57.442
Seven years ago,
the quake heralded my arrival.

03:58.481 --> 04:01.315
Over the centuries,
many lives have been spent...

04:01.351 --> 04:03.616
searching for
the legendary Double Dragon.

04:05.123 --> 04:06.249
Now...

04:09.195 --> 04:10.321
it's mine.

04:25.048 --> 04:29.816
This is only half of it.
Where is the second dragon?

04:55.218 --> 04:57.550
Find me the other half now!

04:58.155 --> 05:00.089

05:19.215 --> 05:21.410
MAN: Come on, Jim. Watch it!

05:22.852 --> 05:24.184
Yeah!

05:27.892 --> 05:29.723
[Rumbling]

05:29.761 --> 05:31.023
ANNOUNCER: Remain calm.

05:31.062 --> 05:33.793
This is an aftershock,
not a quake.

05:47.549 --> 05:48.812
MAN: Yeah!

06:18.521 --> 06:21.217
Dragonfly,

06:21.257 --> 06:23.055
Don't call me Dragonfly.

06:28.133 --> 06:29.896

06:48.759 --> 06:51.091

07:08.182 --> 07:11.550

07:12.587 --> 07:14.579
JlMMY: History repeats itself.

07:14.624 --> 07:17.219
Congratulations, Billy.
You lost the prize money.

07:17.261 --> 07:20.719
BlLLY: You were playing it safe.
l was having fun.

07:20.764 --> 07:23.791
-Have fun out of the ring!
-What a buzz kill!

07:28.641 --> 07:31.008
Better luck next time...losers.

07:31.044 --> 07:32.773
[Man laughing]

07:32.813 --> 07:35.214
-East some fist, buttheads!
-Billy, no!

07:44.327 --> 07:48.264
-You're dead, loser!
-Aah!

07:48.299 --> 07:49.630
MAN: Look out!

08:01.048 --> 08:04.644
lt's Sunday. You're watching
the Raiders-Gladiators game.

08:04.686 --> 08:06.620
Suddenly the house collapses.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.782
How embarrassing.
lt's not your fault.

08:08.824 --> 08:12.158
lt's everybody's fault.
Go to Jack City.

08:12.195 --> 08:14.663
You can choose
from hundreds of colors.

08:14.698 --> 08:16.963
Remember,
if you didn't buy from us...

08:17.001 --> 08:20.096
you don't know Jack--
[Clap] City.

08:20.606 --> 08:23.302
WOMAN: From Hollywood Harbor
to the Tijuana border,

08:23.342 --> 08:26.176
this is New Angeles'
number one nightly news,

08:26.212 --> 08:28.704
with George Hamilton
and Vanna White.

08:29.617 --> 08:32.746
lt's daylight
savings time again.

08:32.788 --> 08:35.313
Set your clocks one hour ahead,

08:35.357 --> 08:39.818
or tomorrow, you may find
yourself out after curfew.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.592
VANNA: l get them mixed up,

08:41.631 --> 08:43.861
whether to go forward
or backward.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.166
Ha ha ha! That's great, Vanna.

08:47.205 --> 08:49.070
Andy, how's it look out there?

08:49.107 --> 08:51.668
Oh, you two are crazy.

08:51.710 --> 08:55.442
We don't want our viewers
playing beat the clock...

08:55.482 --> 08:56.847
with the city gangs.

08:56.950 --> 09:00.853
Our ratings might go down.
Ha ha! Boom ! OK! Oh, boy!

09:00.888 --> 09:05.189
Pack your oxygen masks tomorrow.
We're in for some black rain.

09:05.227 --> 09:07.924
All the smog fans
won't blow this away.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.456
lf you have a smog fan,
stay near it.

09:10.501 --> 09:12.867
lf you don't, get a job.

09:12.903 --> 09:17.364
Our live pictures are beamed
from police headquarters...

09:17.409 --> 09:20.402
as Chief Delario reels
his officers in for the night.

09:20.446 --> 09:23.211
As the police reclaim
the streets tomorrow morning,

09:23.250 --> 09:27.415
expect balmy temperatures
throughout New Angeles.

09:30.925 --> 09:33.451
-We got everybody in?
-Yes, sir.

09:33.495 --> 09:35.122
Good. See you tomorrow.

09:36.199 --> 09:38.326
ANDY DlCK: ...precipitation
in Lake Pasadena,

09:38.368 --> 09:40.633
eighty percent
in New Angeles City,

09:40.671 --> 09:43.299
and the same thing
in New Tokyo City.

09:43.341 --> 09:47.210
The high tide tomorrow
will be at 11:05 a.m.

09:47.246 --> 09:51.843
The water's gonna go all the way
up to Hollywood and Vine.

09:52.586 --> 09:53.917
Looks great.

09:57.125 --> 09:59.525
Perfect. We're out after curfew.

10:00.528 --> 10:04.488
We'll be gang bait because
you fought those jerks.

10:04.533 --> 10:06.866
We needed the practice.

10:06.904 --> 10:08.735
You might be getting much more.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.338
BlLLY: Hey, clowns.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.479
They're gnarly.

10:23.925 --> 10:27.623
BlLLY: Chick at two o'clock.
She is my type.

10:28.163 --> 10:30.792
Pull over. Pull over!

10:30.833 --> 10:32.960
WOMAN: That's a bad idea.

10:41.780 --> 10:43.715
You're right. She's your type.

10:46.585 --> 10:48.486
Trap! Go! Go!

10:54.429 --> 10:55.761
lt's the Mohawks.

11:03.039 --> 11:05.031
Ha ha!

11:06.711 --> 11:09.010
Moby Dick over there
is Bo Abobo,

11:09.047 --> 11:10.514
a steroid freak.

11:10.549 --> 11:14.418
Says he can bench press
800 pounds.

11:15.388 --> 11:17.380
The toll is 50 bucks.

11:25.434 --> 11:29.337
Good evening, gentlemen.
May l see some identification?

11:32.075 --> 11:34.567
l left it in my other pants.

11:34.612 --> 11:35.772
ABOBO: Handle it, Hawk.

11:37.615 --> 11:40.176
Fifty bucks. We accept
major credit cards...

11:40.219 --> 11:42.188
including American Express.

11:42.956 --> 11:44.389
Any problem?

11:46.560 --> 11:49.723
Hey, what's that? Ah!

11:49.764 --> 11:51.699
JlMMY: Satori, give it to him !

11:51.733 --> 11:54.726
-lt's got sentimental value.
-Ah.

11:55.304 --> 11:58.296
-Aah!
-Ha ha!

11:59.109 --> 12:00.371
Drive!

12:19.133 --> 12:22.797
-Get us going faster!
-Like l'm just sitting here!

12:42.996 --> 12:45.795
HAWK: We know these guys.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.302
lt's the Lee brothers--
Ug and Home.

12:48.336 --> 12:49.304
Who?

12:49.338 --> 12:50.305
Right on Wilshire.

12:54.010 --> 12:58.107
Oh, l get it--Ug Lee, Home Lee.
Ha ha!

12:58.149 --> 13:00.481
-Uh!
-Ha ha!

13:25.182 --> 13:26.171
Come on!

13:29.420 --> 13:32.185
SATORl: They'll cut us off!
JlMMY: Stoke the fire!

13:32.224 --> 13:33.953
BlLLY: l'm stoking it!

13:33.993 --> 13:35.119
Floor it, Jimmy!

13:44.673 --> 13:46.868
JlMMY: Go!
BlLLY: They need a map!

13:49.913 --> 13:51.608
Yes! Whoo!

13:51.648 --> 13:54.948
HAWK: We can't see!
How can you drive?

13:55.586 --> 13:56.884
No problem.

14:04.197 --> 14:05.597
Let's have some fun.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.018
BlLLY: Come on, lose them.

14:24.055 --> 14:25.716
Let's see them handle this.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.466
We lost them.

14:43.813 --> 14:45.872
HAWK: Whoa!

14:47.517 --> 14:50.281
Dude, you must suck
at video games.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.051
Give me that!
Ha! l got it.

14:53.091 --> 14:54.319
ABOBO: Get them !

14:57.696 --> 14:59.824
[Beeping]

15:01.368 --> 15:02.858
BOTH: Shortcut!

15:14.017 --> 15:15.279
lncoming!

15:18.355 --> 15:19.686
What else can we burn?

15:22.294 --> 15:24.592
BlLLY: Uh...what is this?

15:25.431 --> 15:29.732
"Nitrate, sulfate."
What could happen?

15:34.909 --> 15:39.176
HAWK: Whoa!
ABOBO: Buttheads! Argh!

15:39.214 --> 15:40.374
Whoa!

15:42.052 --> 15:43.041
Woo-hoo!

15:54.467 --> 15:57.061
-Look out!
-Aah!

15:57.370 --> 15:59.430
[Tires screech]

16:04.512 --> 16:06.605
Game over, Ug Lee.

16:13.457 --> 16:15.722
[Screaming]

16:36.953 --> 16:39.888
My whole life just flashed
before my eyes.

16:39.922 --> 16:42.084
Dude, l sleep a lot.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.856
JlMMY: Are you crazy?
We almost wrecked.

16:44.895 --> 16:46.261
Look at his rig.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.063
They'll need a can opener.

16:52.405 --> 16:54.203
JlMMY: l hope he has insurance.

16:54.241 --> 16:55.833
[Abobo growling and screaming]

17:00.148 --> 17:01.581
He looks really mad.

17:11.529 --> 17:14.693
Uh, you go ahead.
l'll watch the truck.

17:17.868 --> 17:21.362
-So what's the plan?
-l'm working out the details.

17:29.017 --> 17:30.143
Hey, broomhead!

17:30.185 --> 17:32.086
We'll sweep the floor
with your skull!

17:32.121 --> 17:33.782
[Growling]

17:33.823 --> 17:36.292
ABOBO: Huh?
HAWK: Oh, oh.

17:51.644 --> 17:53.806
Let's get out of here.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.583
-Ha! Last of the Mohicans.
-Oh.

17:59.221 --> 18:04.216
BlLLY: Run, you little Tontos.
Go on. Shoo! Shoo!

18:06.330 --> 18:08.321
BlLLY: Oh, great.
The Power Corp.

18:12.303 --> 18:15.740
Team Lee. Need any help?

18:16.375 --> 18:18.537
-Not from you, Marian.
-Yeah, Marian.

18:18.578 --> 18:19.909
ls that so?

18:19.946 --> 18:21.174
BlLLY: Yeah.
JlMMY: Yeah.

18:21.715 --> 18:23.581
[Murmuring]

18:23.618 --> 18:25.985
MARlAN: Always the tough guy,
huh, Jimmy?

18:26.822 --> 18:28.722
You're not worth saving.

18:29.458 --> 18:31.324
We came for this.

18:34.932 --> 18:37.059
lt's a Gangnet link-up.

18:37.101 --> 18:41.061
lt gives us data on the gangs
that are destroying our city.

18:41.106 --> 18:44.235
Marian, the mother of all quakes
did most of the destroying.

18:44.277 --> 18:46.643
The Power Corp
could use you guys.

18:46.679 --> 18:49.615
We could help each other.
What do you say?

18:49.650 --> 18:51.949
JlMMY: You break curfew nightly.

18:51.986 --> 18:55.046
You're as law-abiding
as the gangs. Right?

18:56.692 --> 18:58.159
Wha...heck, no.

18:58.794 --> 19:01.628
Marian's doing a tremendous
service for our city.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.997
What a butt-kiss.

19:06.037 --> 19:07.834
Hey, guys, let's fly.

19:07.872 --> 19:09.898
They'll be back
with reinforcements.

19:17.618 --> 19:19.643
[Yelling]

19:25.461 --> 19:28.487
JlMMY: lt's time you told us
about the dragon.

19:28.664 --> 19:32.192
SATORl: Your father was in the
excavation when it collapsed.

19:33.738 --> 19:37.607
He gave this to me
in Shang-sa...with a warning.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.140
He said the powers of the dragon
are too dangerous...

19:42.182 --> 19:44.275
for one person to possess.

19:46.220 --> 19:50.317
When he died,
l made a promise to myself.

19:51.526 --> 19:55.486
That l'd look after you two
and the medallion.

20:04.242 --> 20:05.504
Doesn't look dangerous.

20:06.077 --> 20:07.636
l broke it in half.

20:09.048 --> 20:12.780
l kept one piece with me
and hid the other.

20:13.487 --> 20:14.818
Jimmy's underwear?

20:18.393 --> 20:19.553
Listen to me.

20:20.362 --> 20:23.456
The medallion acts as
a spiritual amplifier.

20:23.499 --> 20:26.401
lt magnifies the power
inside you.

20:26.436 --> 20:28.701
This half gives power
over the body.

20:28.739 --> 20:30.934
The other half gives power
over the soul.

20:30.975 --> 20:34.878
Legend says it can transform
a man into a ghost...

20:34.913 --> 20:37.041
and give him strength of steel.

20:42.389 --> 20:44.858
Power of body...
and strength of steel?

20:46.561 --> 20:48.028
Where's the "on" button?

20:49.732 --> 20:52.394
To use it now
would put us in danger.

20:54.938 --> 20:57.270
Dark forces know
of its existence.

20:58.609 --> 21:01.407
lt's been the source
of much death and destruction.

21:01.446 --> 21:07.284
lt is our responsibility
to protect the dragon.

22:08.562 --> 22:11.555
Now...as for you, Mr. Abobo--

22:11.599 --> 22:14.535
Lash should have put out an APB
on that medallion.

22:14.570 --> 22:15.901

We can't bring her back.

42:14.287 --> 42:16.517
She should have told us
about the dragon.

42:16.555 --> 42:18.547
She dumped it on us as usual.

42:18.592 --> 42:21.118
How could she know
this would happen?

42:21.162 --> 42:23.323
She did the best she could.

42:23.364 --> 42:26.562
She was the only family we had.

42:26.602 --> 42:29.162
Nobody would take care of us
after Dad died.

42:29.204 --> 42:32.868
What have l been doing?
We need a plan!

42:32.909 --> 42:35.572
No! No more plans!

42:35.613 --> 42:38.913
You're always planning,
and l'm sick of it!

42:39.351 --> 42:42.651
Don't fly off the handle!
This isn't some tournament!

42:44.891 --> 42:46.860
We have to think about this.

42:48.329 --> 42:51.128
What matters now
is that we work together.

42:52.334 --> 42:54.234
We ain't got nobody else.

42:55.905 --> 42:57.702
That's how Satori would want it.

43:01.278 --> 43:03.075
You look like hell.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.579
Look who's talking, Ug Lee.

43:06.284 --> 43:09.846
Get it straight:
You're Ug Lee; l'm Home Lee.

43:10.756 --> 43:12.019
Oh, OK.

43:26.576 --> 43:29.102
-Hooked something.
-All right.

43:31.915 --> 43:34.578
-Go.
-How's that?

43:35.019 --> 43:37.352
JlMMY: Even if Satori's book
burned in the fire,

43:37.390 --> 43:39.324
it probably
wouldn't work anyway.

43:39.358 --> 43:41.088
BlLLY: You're such a downer.

43:42.295 --> 43:43.956
BlLLY: So what's the deal?

43:45.466 --> 43:49.334
JlMMY: This is what we'll do.
We have eight hours of daylight.

43:51.640 --> 43:54.610
We'll be safe while the cops
are on the streets.

43:54.644 --> 43:56.475
That gives us time to get--

46:43.553 --> 46:44.815
Let's swim.

46:44.854 --> 46:48.018

That's liquid death, man.

Come here. Cry on my shoulder.

MAN ON P.A.: ...on the corner

Now for the highlight
of your Hollywood river tour,

49:09.634 --> 49:15.631
we're now approaching the world
famous Mann's Chinese Theatre!

49:18.111 --> 49:19.373
BlLLY: l think we lost one.

49:33.062 --> 49:34.655
This river's flammable!

49:39.904 --> 49:40.996
We're cooked!

49:55.156 --> 49:56.419
Whoa!

49:59.795 --> 50:01.093
Yeah, come on, Jimmy!

-Yuck!

50:50.959 --> 50:52.950
[Coughing and gagging]

50:52.994 --> 50:56.761
This water's gross.
Needs a seat and lid over it.

50:56.799 --> 50:58.664
lf it gets in your mouth,

50:58.701 --> 51:01.694
you get diarrhea
and your hair falls out.

[Spitting]

51:09.181 --> 51:12.379
l'll bet those stooges

51:12.419 --> 51:15.912
Exactly. lt's time
to take the fight to Shuko.

51:22.464 --> 51:24.990
The Hollywood river caught fire
once again today.

51:25.034 --> 51:27.002
When the police went
to investigate,

51:27.036 --> 51:30.700
they were attacked in
broad daylight by gang members.

51:30.741 --> 51:33.108
Here we see footage
from our cop-cams,

51:33.144 --> 51:37.707
as gangs attacked the police,
chanting, "The truce is over."

51:37.750 --> 51:42.211
This is the first daylight
gang attack in seven years.

51:42.255 --> 51:44.849
Let's go now live
to police headquarters.

51:45.727 --> 51:48.025
Chief Delario, Sam Gilespi,

WOMAN: What will you do?
They have rights, too.

51:52.201 --> 51:54.363
GlLESPl: Maybe the gang members
are misunderstood.

51:54.404 --> 51:56.372
MAN: Maybe they need a hug.

51:56.406 --> 51:58.807
GlLESPl: Why did gangs
break the truce?

51:58.843 --> 52:02.507
You realize that it's
23 minutes till sundown?

52:03.482 --> 52:05.575
MAN: l'm gone.
GlLESPl: That's a wrap.

52:13.994 --> 52:19.332
SHUKO: OK, how hard can it be to
pull my dragon from the river?

52:19.368 --> 52:20.892
l mean, it's down there!

52:20.936 --> 52:22.233
The river's really deep.

52:22.271 --> 52:23.762

52:40.728 --> 52:41.888
Huh?

52:45.467 --> 52:48.596
lt's a bad career move, boys.
Bad career move.

52:49.238 --> 52:50.899
Time for plan B.

52:50.940 --> 52:54.604
He who cannot adapt

52:55.612 --> 52:57.945
Get out of here. You disgust me!

by ourselves. We need help.

JlMMY: The Power Corp?

53:26.952 --> 53:29.580
l can't believe
you'd ask Marian for help.

53:29.621 --> 53:33.114
BlLLY: We'll go to the police.

53:33.159 --> 53:35.287
They'll believe
this medallion thing.

53:35.329 --> 53:38.526
"You see, Officer,
we've got this magic medallion.

53:46.375 --> 53:47.638
l don't think so.

53:48.211 --> 53:52.046
The way to stop Shuko is to get
his half of the medallion.

53:52.083 --> 53:53.778
For that, we need help.

53:53.818 --> 53:56.515

53:56.555 --> 53:58.455
-Fine. Then l'll ask her.

it's the other door.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:27.223
OK, the plan is that l have
loaded Abobo's Gangnet link...

with false information...

01:00:28.761 --> 01:00:31.093

01:00:32.431 --> 01:00:35.696
Once l download this
into Shuko's mainframe,

01:00:35.734 --> 01:00:38.032
it should start a gang mutiny.

01:00:38.904 --> 01:00:41.065
That is the plan.

01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:44.835

She's uploading the downlink.

01:00:50.584 --> 01:00:51.778
lt's a bad plan.

01:00:53.553 --> 01:00:55.987
BlLLY: l feel like l'm looking
for a piece of cheese.

01:00:57.824 --> 01:00:59.189

01:00:59.225 --> 01:01:02.092
-You hear what l hear?
-Shuko.

01:01:03.563 --> 01:01:07.727
-Have a good time.
-What? What?

01:01:09.269 --> 01:01:12.397
MARlAN: Wait. Guys, guys.
Where are you going?

01:01:12.439 --> 01:01:13.997
BlLLY: To get the medallion.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.770
MARlAN: You'll get us caught.
We must work together.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:20.837
We have to stick together.
Come on, you guys...

01:01:21.514 --> 01:01:22.674
MARlAN: You guys...

01:01:22.716 --> 01:01:24.343

SHUKO: l control the night...
and you control the day.

01:01:30.323 --> 01:01:31.984
-Oh, God, no.
-Shh.

01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:35.358
You're telling me that
you organized the gangs?

01:01:36.463 --> 01:01:37.953
lt was inevitable.

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:41.024
You see, when you gave them
the night,

01:01:41.067 --> 01:01:43.092
you created a power vacuum.

01:01:43.136 --> 01:01:44.967
BlLLY: Jimmy,
there's the medallion.

01:01:46.339 --> 01:01:48.967
Oh, no. No! What are you doing?

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:51.911
Shh! Shuko's half's
the one with the batteries.

01:01:53.247 --> 01:01:54.771
-What?
-Just borrowing it.

01:01:56.717 --> 01:01:58.412
You're gonna get us caught.

01:01:59.086 --> 01:02:02.385
l think you'll find the rewards
for your cooperation...

01:02:02.423 --> 01:02:04.118
very pleasant, indeed.

01:02:04.158 --> 01:02:06.991
-Now you're trying to bribe me.
-Bribe?

01:02:07.028 --> 01:02:08.222
BlLLY: OK.

01:02:09.964 --> 01:02:11.454
[Shuko speaking indistinctly]

01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:15.725
SHUKO: l have no intention
of bribing a city official.

01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:17.499
Not only is it low-rent...

01:02:17.538 --> 01:02:19.062
[Shuko's voice
continues faintly]

01:02:21.075 --> 01:02:22.406
[Shuko laughing]

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.372
Delario, l own the streets.

01:02:29.417 --> 01:02:34.218
Now, you can make this
hard on yourself...or easy.

01:02:34.255 --> 01:02:36.951
JlMMY: Looks like you're
gonna be rich, Marian. Ooh!

01:02:43.164 --> 01:02:46.099
Ha! You really
disappoint me, Chief.

01:02:48.135 --> 01:02:50.330
SHUKO: l overestimated you,
Delario.

01:02:51.505 --> 01:02:55.100
DELARlO: You control the gangs.
Fine. Live up to the agreement.

01:02:55.142 --> 01:02:56.769
Pull them off the streets or--

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.042
Or what?

01:03:08.356 --> 01:03:09.482
You'll arrest me?

01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:10.650
[Chuckles]

01:03:16.865 --> 01:03:19.891
Great. He took the medallion,
Jimmy. Now what?

01:03:19.935 --> 01:03:23.029
Watch what he does.
He's gonna use it.

01:03:23.071 --> 01:03:26.404
Delario, you're wide-awake
in dreamland.

01:03:26.441 --> 01:03:29.239
l will control New Angeles
with or without you.

01:03:29.277 --> 01:03:31.745
There's no decision
to be made here.

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.305
DELARlO: That's right.
There's no decision to be made.

01:03:35.317 --> 01:03:37.251
l'm cutting no more deals.

01:03:37.285 --> 01:03:39.412
l made one mistake.
l won't make another.

01:03:39.454 --> 01:03:43.288
Perhaps you can't be persuaded
using ordinary means.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.224
DELARlO: You don't know me.
LASH: Unh!

01:03:48.263 --> 01:03:49.958

01:03:55.637 --> 01:03:56.797

-Marian?
-Dad.

01:04:04.947 --> 01:04:09.213
-Does this mean l'm grounded?
-Lash! You said they were dead.

01:04:09.252 --> 01:04:10.719
They will be.

[Shuko whistles]

01:04:21.464 --> 01:04:22.726
Billy, the medallion!

Unh!

01:04:49.826 --> 01:04:53.523

MARlAN: Hey, what is this place?
BlLLY: Looks like a morgue.

01:05:34.705 --> 01:05:36.900
MARlAN: This must be the place
Abobo was talking about.

01:05:53.323 --> 01:05:55.120
-Are they dead?
-No.

01:05:55.158 --> 01:05:57.126
They're in suspended animation.

01:05:58.195 --> 01:05:59.355
[Screams]

01:05:59.396 --> 01:06:02.627
Shh! You could wake the dead!

01:06:05.802 --> 01:06:09.169
Wake the dead. Get it?
lt's like a joke.

01:06:15.913 --> 01:06:17.403
Uh...Jim...

01:06:20.118 --> 01:06:22.746

01:07:00.158 --> 01:07:02.058
You've been annoying me
for far too long.

01:07:03.995 --> 01:07:07.294

[Shuko laughing softly]

01:07:21.346 --> 01:07:23.814
Give me the medallion, or else.

01:07:24.817 --> 01:07:27.445
Or else what?
You'll kill Satori again?

You are looking at New Angeles,
city under siege,

as the daylight violence
continues to escalate...

01:09:54.902 --> 01:09:58.065
now that the gangs have broken
their truce with the police.

01:09:58.105 --> 01:10:00.403
Stay with Channel 69
for continuing coverage...

-At night?

01:10:13.988 --> 01:10:15.717
We're getting railed
in broad daylight.

01:10:15.756 --> 01:10:18.691
Yeah. You can see what's
happening in the daylight.

01:10:18.726 --> 01:10:21.024
Think what'll happen
if we let this go on.

01:10:21.061 --> 01:10:23.052
lt's because
your kid's out there.

01:10:23.097 --> 01:10:27.329
Wrong! lt's because
my daughter is doing our job.

01:10:27.368 --> 01:10:29.268
Now, we're taking back
the streets.

01:10:31.572 --> 01:10:32.869
That's an order!

01:11:14.783 --> 01:11:19.777

to leave. l can expedite this.

Expedite this. Unh!

01:11:38.907 --> 01:11:42.968
Then l will kill you,
just like l did your father.

-What?
-He and l were colleagues.

01:11:52.622 --> 01:11:55.250
l was there when
he discovered the medallion.

01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:57.555
He didn't know what he had.

01:11:57.593 --> 01:12:00.824
ln his hands,
it would've wasted in a museum.

l tried to reason with him.

01:12:02.898 --> 01:12:06.527
The medallion's power could be
used to accomplish great deeds.

01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:11.164
Like burning down
people's homes...or murder?

01:12:11.207 --> 01:12:13.971

So far, all it's done
is give us bad luck.

That thing kept Shuko
from jumping into your body.

01:12:33.062 --> 01:12:35.292
lt protected you.

01:12:35.331 --> 01:12:37.822
We just have to figure out
how to make it work.

-Yeah.

01:12:43.272 --> 01:12:46.173

in the book.

-No.

01:13:01.191 --> 01:13:02.590
You are good enough.

01:13:04.795 --> 01:13:07.628
And you're not by yourself.
You have me.

01:14:32.683 --> 01:14:34.014
Aah!

01:14:47.865 --> 01:14:49.162
Now who's the boss?

-Hello, dragonfly.

Don't call me dragonfly.

Do you know the story
of Romulus and Remus?

Sons of Mars, god of war.

01:17:49.116 --> 01:17:51.482
lf you're waiting for
an emergency, this is it.

01:17:51.518 --> 01:17:55.454
The brothers were abandoned
and raised by wolves.

01:17:55.489 --> 01:17:58.856
Together, they built
the great city of Rome.

you shall not pass.

-Unh!
-Whoa!

01:18:09.103 --> 01:18:12.300
ln a quarrel,
Romulus killed Remus.

01:18:12.339 --> 01:18:13.704
That's a great story.

01:18:34.796 --> 01:18:37.731
Piece of junk.
l could do better without you.

01:18:44.806 --> 01:18:46.000

You've finally unlocked
the power of the medallion.

01:19:26.748 --> 01:19:28.340

or Jimmy dies.

01:22:20.591 --> 01:22:22.286
He hates the lights!

01:22:23.594 --> 01:22:25.323

01:22:30.635 --> 01:22:31.727
Hyah!

01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:35.866
You're weak like your father.

01:22:35.907 --> 01:22:37.306
You're ugly
like your mother.

01:22:37.341 --> 01:22:39.571

Guard them...as l guarded you.

01:24:34.961 --> 01:24:37.794

But l don't have to wear blue.

01:24:43.236 --> 01:24:46.399

-Let's get this chump.

01:24:54.647 --> 01:24:59.107

01:25:56.710 --> 01:25:58.177
What a lovely daughter.

01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:02.506
After all the trouble l've
caused you, it dawned on me--

01:26:02.549 --> 01:26:06.110
the New Angeles police
department is underfunded.

01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:14.286
One hundred twenty-nine million
dollars for the NAPD.

01:26:14.328 --> 01:26:15.522
[Billy whistles]

01:26:22.036 --> 01:26:26.166
-l believe this will help you.
-l said you can't bribe me.

01:26:26.207 --> 01:26:28.607

01:27:29.305 --> 01:27:32.206
l guess you guys
will be taking off now.

01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:34.141
Going to build your dream house?

01:27:34.176 --> 01:27:35.234
No way.

01:27:35.277 --> 01:27:39.543
Why build a house when we
can help build an entire city?

01:27:39.582 --> 01:27:42.050
-With the Double Dragon...
-No, Jimmy.

01:27:42.985 --> 01:27:44.111
We can't use it.

01:27:44.153 --> 01:27:47.020
Satori said we should protect
it from the wrong elements.

01:27:47.056 --> 01:27:49.115
-That's all.
-OK, Mr. Responsible.

01:27:49.158 --> 01:27:50.682
You guys...

01:27:52.027 --> 01:27:53.517

JlMMY: The Dragon Wagon!

01:27:59.668 --> 01:28:02.159
Oh...how'd you get it here?

01:28:02.204 --> 01:28:05.264
The Corp towed it,
and some motorheads fixed it up.

01:28:06.308 --> 01:28:08.071
l thought
you could use some help.

01:28:09.712 --> 01:28:10.872
Thanks, Marian.

01:28:12.848 --> 01:28:16.443

How goes it, Abobo?

01:28:22.958 --> 01:28:28.055
l was just wondering if l could
hang out with you for a change.

01:28:28.097 --> 01:28:31.464
Sure, Abobo,
l think that's a great idea.

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:34.368
l'm tired of fighting.
l really am.

01:28:34.404 --> 01:28:35.701
lt's not Abobo. lt's Billy.

01:28:35.739 --> 01:28:38.469
ABOBO: l just want

01:28:39.476 --> 01:28:45.346
Oh, sweet!
You think maybe l could drive?

01:28:45.382 --> 01:28:48.146
Oh, no.

01:28:48.184 --> 01:28:49.742

01:28:49.786 --> 01:28:51.947
-No problem.

01:28:51.988 --> 01:28:54.388
Abobo, hop on in there.

01:28:54.424 --> 01:28:56.153
[Abobo humming]

01:29:03.266 --> 01:29:05.359

-Trust me.

01:29:06.803 --> 01:29:11.457
l'm sure glad we ditched Billy.
Now Marian and l can be alone.

01:29:17.544 --> 01:29:18.799
[Screaming]

01:29:30.412 --> 01:29:31.995

01:29:32.038 --> 01:29:33.191
-l screwed up?
-Yeah!

01:29:33.232 --> 01:29:35.878
-l screwed up?
-We'll never work here again.

01:29:35.918 --> 01:29:38.530
-Should've been us.
-How can l find the medallion?

01:29:38.572 --> 01:29:40.686
-Now we're finished.
-Now what do we do?

01:29:40.727 --> 01:29:42.944
-Make a commercial?
-Work for an Olympic skater?

01:29:42.982 --> 01:29:45.233
-Think about the future.
-Forget Shuko.

01:29:45.272 --> 01:29:48.416
-Forget Shuko!
-That putz. l never liked him.

01:29:48.455 --> 01:29:50.004

-He told you?

01:29:51.937 --> 01:29:54.051
-No.
-Then how do you know?

01:29:54.093 --> 01:29:56.241
-l know so.
-Yeah? l think you're right.

01:29:56.282 --> 01:29:58.758
-Now what?
-What do you want to do?
