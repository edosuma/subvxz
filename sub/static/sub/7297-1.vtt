Is it all gone?

04:31.505 --> 04:33.020
Yup.

04:33.123 --> 04:34.956
All ninety two American dollars.

04:35.058 --> 04:36.023
You sure?

04:37.127 --> 04:39.326
We could go back
and find the thugs.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.048
How many pancakes can we
get with ninety two dollars?

04:44.150 --> 04:45.066
Mmm...

04:46.402 --> 04:48.369
Ninety two at least.

04:48.472 --> 04:49.303
Alice...

04:49.405 --> 04:50.555
Come on.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.306
You wanna get fat like them?

04:52.408 --> 04:54.892
Maybe you can apply
for a job here.

04:58.248 --> 05:00.081
Alice, where are we going?

05:11.360 --> 05:13.794
Alice, we are in America.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.062
The police here don't
know anything about what

05:15.165 --> 05:16.364
happened in Fujian.

05:21.254 --> 05:21.585
Wait.

05:21.687 --> 05:22.987
Sir!

05:24.391 --> 05:25.089
Sir!

05:25.392 --> 05:26.090
Ken, no!

05:26.192 --> 05:27.926
Are you throwing those away?

05:33.132 --> 05:34.232
Alice!

05:34.334 --> 05:35.399
Come on!

05:43.326 --> 05:44.091
Eat, Alice.

05:44.194 --> 05:45.260
It's free.

06:16.225 --> 06:18.275
Where do you think dad is now?

06:18.377 --> 06:20.878
Alice, cheer up.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.180
Soon we'll be
swimming in hot tubs.

06:23.282 --> 06:27.218
And eating strawberry
pancakes for breakfast.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.054
Before we know it, we'll have
the money to bring dad here.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.478
Ken, it's a market,
like at home!

07:08.344 --> 07:09.309
Excuse me.

07:09.412 --> 07:12.046
Do you think we can set up here?

07:12.148 --> 07:14.314
Uh, yeah, sure.

07:14.417 --> 07:15.249
You can set up right there.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.483
Thank you.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.647
There are no more appointments,
Mr. Sullivan.

08:02.748 --> 08:03.447
Do you need anything else?

08:03.550 --> 08:04.649
No, thank you.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.117
Do you want me to bring
you some lunch before I go?

08:07.220 --> 08:08.252
Oh, no, no, that
won't be necessary.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.120
I only have a few calls to make.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.121
Thanks.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.323
Such a lovely day.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.157
Mmm.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.459
I'll see you on Monday,
Mr. Sullivan.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.394

08:16.496 --> 08:18.162
Oh, have a good weekend.

[telephone rings]

08:29.426 --> 08:30.692
Anything?

08:33.229 --> 08:33.727
Good.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.738
My sister is a real
famous painter from Asia.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.290
Anyone wanna buy her paintings?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.608
Wanna buy some paintings, sir?

09:08.415 --> 09:09.580
Wanna buy my sister's paintings?

09:09.682 --> 09:11.215
They're from Asia.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.519
Wanna buy her paintings, ma'am?

09:17.156 --> 09:18.188
Hey man, wanna buy some
paintings?

09:18.291 --> 09:19.623
Don't touch me!

09:26.299 --> 09:27.765
Ken, what are you doing?

09:30.619 --> 09:31.252
Come on.

09:31.420 --> 09:32.720
Stop it!

09:50.306 --> 09:52.740
I told you I don't
want to fight anymore.

09:53.710 --> 09:55.442
[girl in crowd:

10:03.436 --> 10:04.618
[crowd laughs]

10:04.720 --> 10:10.257
[crowd applauses]

10:30.530 --> 10:31.295
Good job.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.521
I'm sorry, we're open
by appointment only.

10:41.624 --> 10:43.457
You're Justus Sullivan?

10:43.826 --> 10:44.542
Yes.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.294
Marcus Gillani.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.264
Mr. Gillani.

10:50.366 --> 10:52.683
I am surprised we
have never met before.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.818
Of course, I have heard
a great deal about you.

10:54.921 --> 11:00.157
And of course, your
magnificent collection.

11:00.259 --> 11:01.626
I hear you're the type
of guy who can give

11:01.728 --> 11:04.295
me something special?

11:04.397 --> 11:05.746
Special?

11:05.848 --> 11:07.714
I can help with that.

11:16.392 --> 11:17.591
Look at this, Alice.

11:18.527 --> 11:20.327
We're filthy rich.

11:29.738 --> 11:31.205
Come on!

11:32.541 --> 11:34.442
Let's celebrate with
strawberry pancakes!

11:34.543 --> 11:35.659
Hey!

11:35.762 --> 11:36.877
Give me the bag!

11:38.114 --> 11:39.330
No!

11:39.432 --> 11:40.798
Oh, thank God.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.233
Asians!

11:43.436 --> 11:43.801
Are you okay?

11:43.903 --> 11:45.603
Go get him!

11:45.705 --> 11:46.904
Give her purse back!

11:54.680 --> 11:55.563
Let me take care of him.

11:55.665 --> 11:57.331
Just let him go.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.422
Take it, take it.

12:55.958 --> 12:56.857
I'm sorry.

12:56.959 --> 12:58.842
I'm gettin' out of here.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.979
Thank you so much, officers.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.281
So, you'll be sure to...

13:03.383 --> 13:06.551
Come to the station tomorrow
morning, first thing and look

13:06.653 --> 13:07.051
at mug shots.

13:07.153 --> 13:07.818
Right.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.323
Oh, I'll be there with bells on.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.696
Don't worry.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.831
They won't be back.

13:20.933 --> 13:24.769
You heard me tell them that some
kids chased away the thugs.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.887
Hispanic kids!

13:26.990 --> 13:28.689
Go sit down.

13:28.791 --> 13:30.608
I'm gonna go get the food.

13:33.713 --> 13:34.879
Ken, let's go.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.830
Not a chance.

13:36.932 --> 13:38.115
If the police find me...

13:38.217 --> 13:38.850
No way.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.601
I'm staying right here.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.626
Alice, stop worrying.

13:51.631 --> 13:52.997
Tada!

13:53.098 --> 13:56.334
I don't mess around
in the kitchen.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.919
This is the biggest burger
I've seen in my life.

13:59.022 --> 14:00.587
It's like a cow died on a plate.

14:00.689 --> 14:01.622
[laughs]

14:01.724 --> 14:03.924
Alice, you are in for a treat.

14:04.026 --> 14:05.910
Shove over, you.

14:06.946 --> 14:09.497
Oh, are you a vegetarian?

14:11.134 --> 14:12.483
Well, what the heck
are you waiting for?

14:12.752 --> 14:13.650
Dig in!

14:20.910 --> 14:21.909
Wow.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.931
This is the best
hamburger in America.

14:30.052 --> 14:33.920
You guys were sure hungry!

14:35.474 --> 14:37.675
I bet you two came
in that containership.

14:37.777 --> 14:38.558
Am I right?

14:38.660 --> 14:39.626
Geez.

14:39.728 --> 14:40.760
You saved my life.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.896
You can trust me.

14:42.998 --> 14:45.666
Can we help you
clean up the dishes?

14:55.044 --> 14:57.727
Do you kids have
a place to stay?

14:59.098 --> 15:00.781
Yes, with some relatives.

15:00.883 --> 15:03.935
My ass, but, nevermind.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.836
We probably should go.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.005
Thank you so much for dinner.

15:08.107 --> 15:10.790
Should I call you a cab?

15:10.893 --> 15:11.858
No, we like to walk.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.093
Me too!

15:13.195 --> 15:15.029
I was on my way home...

15:15.131 --> 15:15.929
We'll walk with you!

15:16.031 --> 15:18.682
Oh, that would be s'well!

15:18.784 --> 15:22.152
I guess I'm starting
to feel a little...

15:22.254 --> 15:23.087
Oh, I don't know.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.822
That was really
something wasn't it?

15:25.924 --> 15:28.642
The way you two
just slammed him.

15:32.915 --> 15:35.015
Do you think you could meet
me here every night until they

15:35.117 --> 15:36.783
catch that guy?

15:36.885 --> 15:37.201
Sure.

15:37.303 --> 15:37.768
What time?

15:37.870 --> 15:39.036
4:30 p.m.

15:39.138 --> 15:41.705
3:30, if you want a burger.

15:41.808 --> 15:42.773
Oh, great.

15:42.875 --> 15:43.573
Come on.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.609
It's just down this way.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.746
Oh, you have no
idea how happy I am.

16:26.852 --> 16:27.751
Asian girl.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.086
Maybe in her early thirties.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.204
Shot in the chest.

16:32.107 --> 16:33.874
Washed up here a
couple hours ago.

16:33.976 --> 16:37.044
Maybe, three or four
days in the water.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.795
Anything else?

16:42.852 --> 16:44.534
Let me take a look.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.005
Nothing.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.089
Pretty girl.

16:49.191 --> 16:50.824
Hmm...

16:50.926 --> 16:52.158
Hmm.

17:04.740 --> 17:05.673
Okay, get some pictures.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.726
Let me know when you
get something on her.

17:08.827 --> 17:09.826
Alright.

17:19.037 --> 17:21.105
Hey, want to see
my sister's painting?

17:26.044 --> 17:27.944
Hey, you want to see

17:28.047 --> 17:28.879
Nah, I'm okay.

Woohoo!

18:06.084 --> 18:07.117
Ken, stop it.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.735
We don't need the attention.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.038
Anyone?

18:11.139 --> 18:12.172
No, thank you.

19:51.039 --> 19:51.972
Come on, get up!

19:52.074 --> 19:52.806
Alice, come on.

19:52.908 --> 19:54.157
They want to see
you do something.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.426
Ken, no!

20:02.585 --> 20:04.968
Come on, they want to
see you do something!

20:06.922 --> 20:07.988
Yeah!

20:11.009 --> 20:12.392
[crowd applauses]

20:13.929 --> 20:14.961
That's what I'm talking about.

20:15.064 --> 20:16.963
Alice Qiang,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:17.066 --> 20:19.282
[crowd applauses]

20:20.152 --> 20:21.184
Woo!

20:21.320 --> 20:21.835
Yeah!

20:21.937 --> 20:24.187
[crowd applauses]

20:32.247 --> 20:33.413
- Good job.
- Thanks.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.552
Good job, Alice.

20:41.356 --> 20:42.856
I saw her the other day too.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.324
She's awesome.

20:44.426 --> 20:45.192
What's her name?

20:45.294 --> 20:46.193
Her name is Alice.

20:46.295 --> 20:48.194
And, she is awesome.

20:50.516 --> 20:50.948
Good job.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.182
Thanks.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.134
More money.

20:55.237 --> 20:55.602
Thank you.

20:55.704 --> 20:56.737
More money, please.

20:56.839 --> 20:57.337
Thank you.

20:57.439 --> 20:58.905
More money, please.

21:01.176 --> 21:01.825
Yeah.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.327
We're rich!

21:04.463 --> 21:06.196
You're so crazy.

21:17.259 --> 21:18.592
Do you like the acrobatics?

21:18.678 --> 21:20.110
Cause, we can do more.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.162
I like this.

21:22.264 --> 21:23.163
This is beautiful.

21:23.265 --> 21:24.330
Did you do this?

21:25.868 --> 21:28.168
I'm interested in
meeting the painter.

21:28.270 --> 21:29.102
You like my work?

21:29.204 --> 21:30.236
Very much.

21:30.338 --> 21:32.338
East Asian, am I right?

21:39.148 --> 21:39.446
What's happening?

21:39.548 --> 21:40.564
The usual.

21:40.666 --> 21:43.066
The police are checking
for market permits.

21:43.169 --> 21:47.187
But sometimes, that's just
their way of finding illegals.

21:47.289 --> 21:50.173
But of course, you have
market permit, right?

21:50.275 --> 21:51.107
Come.

21:51.209 --> 21:52.259
My gallery is
right up the street.

21:52.361 --> 21:53.393
Your what?

21:53.495 --> 21:54.411
My art gallery.

21:54.513 --> 21:55.979
Come.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.512
Come.

22:13.515 --> 22:14.865
Come.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.539
Do these all belong to you?

22:22.641 --> 22:24.975
Well, these are all my painters.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.978
People whose work I
love and try to sell.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.447
Is this your first
time in a gallery?

22:30.549 --> 22:33.516
I've seen them on TV before.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.986
Our dad has a shop
where we sell paintings.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.320
Copies of paintings.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.423
Not like these.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.625
Originals.

22:42.344 --> 22:42.726
Wait a minute.

22:42.828 --> 22:43.810
Do you mind?

22:43.912 --> 22:46.513
I'd like to see all
of them if that's okay.

22:49.218 --> 22:51.318
Oh, this one.

22:51.419 --> 22:53.019
And this one.

22:54.489 --> 22:55.322
You want to buy them?

22:55.423 --> 22:57.023
How much?

23:00.495 --> 23:01.928
Four, six, zero, zero.

23:02.031 --> 23:02.996
- Ken.
- US dollars.

23:03.098 --> 23:04.681
[laughs] Really?

23:04.683 --> 23:06.533
I think that's a little high.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.403
I think I would
try for a thousand.

23:09.505 --> 23:11.137
Maybe, a little more.

23:11.240 --> 23:15.292
You mean one
thousand US dollars?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.227
What is your name?

23:17.329 --> 23:17.895
Alice.

23:17.996 --> 23:20.013
And this is my brother.

23:20.115 --> 23:21.081
Ken.

23:21.183 --> 23:24.150
Alice, I would like to
try to sell your work.

23:24.253 --> 23:25.319
What do you think?

23:28.240 --> 23:28.605
I...

23:28.707 --> 23:30.373
I'll take three.

23:30.476 --> 23:32.375
Wait a minute.

23:32.478 --> 23:34.294
What's this?

23:34.296 --> 23:35.295
Oh, no, that's just a copy.

23:35.397 --> 23:36.230
Yes, I know.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.797
Cezanne.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.083
Not the same size, of course.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.452
You did this?

23:42.554 --> 23:45.905
In my country, people
only want European art.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.041
No one wants originals.
- Originals.

23:48.143 --> 23:52.112
Hmm, I like here.

23:52.214 --> 23:54.380
And here.

23:54.482 --> 23:57.367
You got it exactly right.

23:59.504 --> 24:02.805
Well, no more of this.

24:02.907 --> 24:06.509
From now on, only originals.

24:07.513 --> 24:08.145
Come.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.379
Sit.

24:10.315 --> 24:12.349
My name is Justus Sullivan.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.535
I invest in people I think
have potential like you.

24:15.637 --> 24:17.938
Here is what we can do.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.224
You loan me those
three paintings to hang

24:20.326 --> 24:21.524
here in the gallery.

24:21.626 --> 24:25.094
And in exchange I give you a
small fee for the privilege of

24:25.197 --> 24:26.196
selling your work.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.565
Now, should we get lucky,
the gallery's commission

24:28.834 --> 24:30.683
is 50 percent.

24:33.338 --> 24:35.088
How much fee?

24:35.190 --> 24:36.489
500 dollars.

24:36.591 --> 24:39.626
Deducted of course, from
the proceeds of the sale.

24:39.728 --> 24:43.529
Whether they sell or not, the
five hundred is yours to keep.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.116
What about this?

24:47.219 --> 24:49.136
Oh, you can keep that as well.

24:50.205 --> 24:54.257
Alice and Ken... your last name?

24:54.359 --> 24:55.125
Qiang.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.259
Spell that, please.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.595
Q-I-A-N-G

24:58.697 --> 25:00.030
Ken!

25:01.233 --> 25:02.065
Alice, what?

25:02.167 --> 25:03.400
It's your paintings.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.301
Anyways, now you'll be famous.

25:05.404 --> 25:08.121
Well, if that's all settled,
I'll have my secretary drop

25:08.223 --> 25:09.522
a contract tomorrow.

25:09.624 --> 25:11.825
Where can I reach you?

25:14.313 --> 25:15.128
Well...

25:15.230 --> 25:17.397
We'll figure that out, later.

25:17.499 --> 25:21.618
In the mean time, how
about joining me for dinner?

25:21.720 --> 25:22.602
Well, let's celebrate!

25:22.704 --> 25:23.670
No, it's okay.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.472
Thank you, you've
done so much for us.

25:25.574 --> 25:26.606
Don't be silly.

25:26.708 --> 25:28.341
I'll tell you what.

25:28.443 --> 25:31.278
My house is not very far from
here and I have a wonderful

25:31.380 --> 25:33.146
housekeeper who cooks for me.

25:33.248 --> 25:34.347
What would you like?

25:34.449 --> 25:35.632
Steak?

25:35.734 --> 25:36.633
Pasta?

25:36.735 --> 25:39.303
What about a hamburger?

25:39.405 --> 25:41.371
We probably can manage that.

25:41.473 --> 25:42.722
Come on.

25:44.342 --> 25:45.609
Wait.

25:46.544 --> 25:47.644
My paintings.

25:47.746 --> 25:49.462
Of course.

25:59.557 --> 26:01.624
Welcome to my home.

26:38.780 --> 26:40.613
There are so many.

26:40.715 --> 26:42.481
Where did you get all of this?

26:42.584 --> 26:43.482
Some I bought.

26:43.585 --> 26:44.701
Some are gifts.

26:44.803 --> 26:47.170
In one day, I've seen more
original paintings than in

26:47.272 --> 26:48.304
my whole life.

26:48.406 --> 26:50.790
I have quite a few I think
you would appreciate.

26:53.195 --> 26:56.546
Right this way,
one of my favorites.

26:58.300 --> 26:58.965
This one.

26:59.067 --> 27:02.668
Oh, this one, I got it in Paris.

27:02.721 --> 27:05.238
That was about five
or six years ago.

27:05.340 --> 27:07.807
And this one I
picked up in Moscow.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.162
And here is the TV room.

27:15.850 --> 27:19.252
It's like a movie theater.

27:19.354 --> 27:19.786
Look at these.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.455
Can we watch one?

27:21.557 --> 27:23.389
Ken, not now!

27:23.492 --> 27:25.125
Sure, why not?

27:25.227 --> 27:28.761
You can come over and watch
movies anytime you want.

27:36.238 --> 27:40.323
Now, Alice, here is
the pièce de résistance.

27:43.661 --> 27:46.413
I used to paint myself,
I don't much anymore.

27:46.514 --> 27:50.817
But, this is my favorite
part of the house.

27:50.919 --> 27:54.153
I admit to having a bit
of love affair with art.

27:54.255 --> 27:57.156
I guess I discovered that
my talent was more about

27:57.258 --> 28:01.294
finding original artists,
than making original paintings.

28:01.396 --> 28:02.395
All of this and no one...

28:02.497 --> 28:03.296
No.

28:03.398 --> 28:04.530
A bit of a waste, really.

28:04.632 --> 28:06.783
Sort of like the TV room.

28:06.885 --> 28:08.734
Use it whenever you want.

28:09.604 --> 28:11.320
Why?

28:11.423 --> 28:12.756
Why me?

28:13.425 --> 28:14.758
I mean...

28:17.562 --> 28:18.744
Why us?

28:18.764 --> 28:21.714
Cause, like I said, my
talent is for finding artists.

28:21.816 --> 28:24.334
Helping to bring new
work into the world.

28:24.436 --> 28:27.670
When I find someone
I believe in.

28:27.772 --> 28:28.604
Come on.

28:28.706 --> 28:29.639
Let's eat.

28:40.986 --> 28:44.487
So, why did you come
to the United States?

28:44.589 --> 28:47.340
Because, I want to be a painter.

28:47.442 --> 28:49.526
You don't sound very convinced.

28:51.863 --> 28:53.746
Do you have family here?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.399
No, it's just us.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.084
What?

28:58.186 --> 29:00.369
Might as well tell the truth.

29:00.472 --> 29:03.272
So, where are you staying?

29:04.476 --> 29:06.542
Ah, just as I thought.

29:06.628 --> 29:07.360
Let me guess.

29:07.462 --> 29:08.794
Maybe a park?

29:09.998 --> 29:11.498
You're very lucky, you know?

29:11.599 --> 29:13.900
Many people don't even
survive the journey.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.853
You must've wanted to
come here very badly.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.655
Alright, then.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.373
You need a place to stay.

29:20.475 --> 29:23.526
And as you see, I have
a lot of spare rooms.

29:23.628 --> 29:24.527
Can we Alice?

29:24.629 --> 29:25.796
Can we?

29:25.898 --> 29:27.397
We appreciate that.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.866
But, we will be fine, thank you.

29:29.968 --> 29:33.520
Look, I have been very lucky in
my life and I like to give back

29:33.622 --> 29:34.987
when I can.

31:21.946 --> 31:23.179
Alice!

31:23.815 --> 31:25.648
We're living the dream!

31:25.750 --> 31:26.383
Shh!

31:26.484 --> 31:27.700
You'll wake Mr. Sullivan up.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.034
Good morning!

31:29.136 --> 31:31.904
Strawberry pancakes
are on the table.

31:32.006 --> 31:33.506
Did you ask for them?

31:33.608 --> 31:36.776
I told him they're
your favorite.

31:36.878 --> 31:38.911
Oh, good, you found
the paints already.

31:39.013 --> 31:40.646
Sorry, I should have asked.

31:40.749 --> 31:41.848
No, I'm glad you
feel comfortable.

31:41.949 --> 31:43.949
That is what I wanted.

31:46.104 --> 31:47.720
Breakfast?

31:47.822 --> 31:49.722
You better eat.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.275
You need great strength to
be a great painter, you know.

31:52.377 --> 31:53.777
How can we ever thank you?

31:53.879 --> 31:55.344
You can't.

31:55.446 --> 31:58.014
Oh, if I don't hurry, I will be
late for my first appointment

31:58.116 --> 31:59.716
at the gallery.

32:59.694 --> 33:00.760
Bravo!

33:09.037 --> 33:09.936
Wow.

33:10.038 --> 33:12.138
Impressive!

33:12.240 --> 33:14.040
Where did you learn
how to do that?

33:14.109 --> 33:16.075
Our grandpa taught me
everyday after school.

33:16.177 --> 33:17.477
Alice too.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.812
But, she won't help
me out anymore.

33:19.914 --> 33:21.280
What do you mean?

33:21.382 --> 33:23.616
She's too busy
learning how to paint.

33:23.718 --> 33:24.617
It's all she thinks about.

33:24.719 --> 33:25.985
Maybe you should be
learning things too.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.220
You're sixteen.

33:27.322 --> 33:29.622
You're going to have to
finish high school some time.

33:29.724 --> 33:30.956
I don't like to study.

33:31.058 --> 33:32.257
What do you like?

33:32.360 --> 33:33.193
This!

33:35.263 --> 33:38.647
But, I just can't get it right.

33:38.749 --> 33:43.186
You know, I have a friend
I'd like you to meet.

33:43.288 --> 33:46.789
A fellow who happens
to own a boxing gym.

33:46.891 --> 33:48.057
- Really?
- Mhm.

33:48.159 --> 33:49.792
What are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

33:49.894 --> 33:50.726
Nothing.

33:50.828 --> 33:52.928
We're on.

33:53.030 --> 33:57.650
Mr. Sullivan, Alice doesn't
really like for me to fight.

33:57.752 --> 34:00.085
I guess we don't have
to tell her then, do we?

34:20.792 --> 34:21.824
So, what do you think?

34:21.926 --> 34:24.693
Can you find
something to do here?

34:24.795 --> 34:25.694
Awesome.

34:25.797 --> 34:26.161
Justus.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.112
Good to see you.

34:29.116 --> 34:30.215
Who do we have here?

34:30.317 --> 34:31.684
Half of my latest project.

34:31.786 --> 34:32.885
His name is Ken Qiang.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.820
Ken, this is Lee.

34:34.922 --> 34:36.088
New in town.

34:36.190 --> 34:37.156
He's got some great moves.

34:37.257 --> 34:38.858
See what you think.

34:40.261 --> 34:41.978
Hey, uh, Freddie.

34:42.931 --> 34:44.114
Get this kid some gloves.

34:44.216 --> 34:45.998
Come with me, kid.

34:53.224 --> 34:54.857
And, the other half?

34:54.958 --> 34:55.925
His sister.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.726
A painter.

34:57.828 --> 34:58.927
Asking for trouble.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.630
We'll see.

35:01.832 --> 35:03.732
Keep the kid busy, will you?

35:03.834 --> 35:06.035
- I don't want to worry about...
- Sure.

35:07.305 --> 35:09.806
What about Mei?

35:09.907 --> 35:11.207
No news.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.075
So... good news.

35:13.177 --> 35:14.877
Even better.

35:14.979 --> 35:18.631
Because I believe we
may have a new client.

35:23.972 --> 35:24.820
Hey, kid.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.923
Is that the best you can do?

35:28.993 --> 35:37.033
Okay.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.767
Bags are one thing.

35:38.870 --> 35:39.836
Let's see how he
does in the ring.

35:39.938 --> 35:40.803
Okay.

35:42.006 --> 35:43.105
Hey, not bad.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.440
Not bad.

35:45.076 --> 35:46.809
You want to try sparring?

35:47.879 --> 35:48.677
Sure.

35:49.214 --> 35:50.813
Hey, Rob!

35:55.353 --> 35:57.686
Take Ken for a couple rounds.

36:13.471 --> 36:14.086
Don't worry.

36:14.155 --> 36:15.922
Won't hurt you too much, kid.

36:16.124 --> 36:16.972
Don't worry, old man.

36:17.025 --> 36:18.908
I won't beat you up too bad.

37:01.152 --> 37:02.051
Okay.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.152
Okay.

37:04.338 --> 37:05.154
Ken?

37:06.824 --> 37:08.741
Give me a hand
here with this guy.

37:08.843 --> 37:09.442
Ken?

37:09.544 --> 37:10.560
Let's get him out of here.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.112
I don't want
somebody seeing this.

37:13.214 --> 37:14.146
That's not bad.

37:15.416 --> 37:17.984
That's not bad at all.

37:18.086 --> 37:20.987
Listen, we're having a
competition here tomorrow night.

37:21.089 --> 37:22.388
You should come.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.057
Maybe you make a few bucks.

37:24.159 --> 37:25.258
Bucks?

37:25.360 --> 37:26.926
As in American money?

37:27.028 --> 37:27.860
How?

37:27.962 --> 37:28.994
I'm in.

37:29.097 --> 37:31.014
I like your attitude.

37:31.116 --> 37:33.415
Sure, fighters can
make a little cash.

37:33.518 --> 37:38.337
But, of course, it's the
winners who make the most.

37:38.439 --> 37:40.439
Land of opportunity.

37:41.375 --> 37:42.174
I love it!

37:49.967 --> 37:51.100
Come on, Marty.

37:51.202 --> 37:53.102
Something, anything because
the bosses are all over me

37:53.204 --> 37:54.036
on this one.

37:54.138 --> 37:56.055
Well, you were right
about the paint.

37:56.057 --> 37:57.890
There was something funny.

37:57.992 --> 37:59.676
We missed it the first time.

38:00.478 --> 38:01.944
Now, we're talking.

38:03.481 --> 38:07.100
So, oil paint, on her
hands, and on her jeans.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.234
Lead-based.

38:08.336 --> 38:09.902
That's odd.

38:10.004 --> 38:11.303
That's what I thought.

38:11.405 --> 38:13.305
Lead was banned in
most paints years ago.

38:13.407 --> 38:15.241
Most, but not all.

38:15.343 --> 38:16.776
Meaning?

38:16.878 --> 38:19.378
I'm not sure yet,
but I have a hunch.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.447
Such a great investigator.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.916
Got a hunch about a man for me?

38:24.018 --> 38:25.484
Thanks for this.

38:51.279 --> 38:52.161
Good morning!

38:52.179 --> 38:52.845
Good morning.

38:53.114 --> 38:54.013
How are you?

38:54.115 --> 38:58.217
I've never had so much
canvas, paint, time before.

38:58.319 --> 39:02.088
If I'm not good now,
I can only blame myself.

39:02.189 --> 39:05.974
Alice, I have a favor to ask.

39:06.077 --> 39:06.442
Yes?

39:06.544 --> 39:08.544
Look here.

39:12.317 --> 39:12.548
Van Gogh.

39:12.650 --> 39:13.583
Yes.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.368
The painter who once
said he had no technique.

39:16.470 --> 39:18.370
I've never seen a
real Van Gogh before.

39:18.472 --> 39:20.122
Is there one in Seattle?

39:20.224 --> 39:23.993
This particular painting
disappeared during World War II.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.528
And it hasn't been seen since.

39:25.579 --> 39:26.578
But, yes.

39:26.680 --> 39:29.282
There are a couple at
the Seattle Art Museum.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.632
Have you never been to a museum?

39:30.734 --> 39:31.650
No.

39:31.752 --> 39:34.870
Well, we must get
you there pronto.

39:34.972 --> 39:37.406
Well, I remember that
copy that you did.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.858
And I know it's not
what you want to do.

39:39.960 --> 39:45.464
But, I was hoping that you would
consider copying this for me.

39:45.567 --> 39:47.016
Why?

39:47.118 --> 39:49.151
It's for a friend.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.487
Also an immigrant from Croatia.

39:51.589 --> 39:53.288
He's been very ill.

39:53.390 --> 39:55.024
Doesn't have much time.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.193
Maybe a year, maybe less.

39:59.130 --> 40:02.030
And that is his
favorite painting.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.148
I owe him a lot.

40:03.251 --> 40:05.150
I know it sounds
rather grandiose.

40:05.253 --> 40:08.153
But, I just want
to give it to him.

40:08.256 --> 40:10.289
Of course, he'll know
that I didn't find it.

40:10.391 --> 40:12.925
And we'll have a
good laugh about that.

40:14.596 --> 40:15.944
Will you?

40:17.148 --> 40:18.180
Mr. Sullivan.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.047
Justus.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.083
Please, call me Justus.

40:22.286 --> 40:23.085
Justus.

40:23.187 --> 40:26.054
Ken and I are so
much in your debt.

40:26.157 --> 40:29.908
But, I don't think
I can get this right.

40:30.010 --> 40:32.044
I can't even see
the brush stroke.

40:32.146 --> 40:33.912
I have a better version.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.182
About the same size
as the original.

40:36.284 --> 40:38.450
Well, excuse me.

40:38.552 --> 40:40.453
Why don't you give him that?

40:40.555 --> 40:43.238
I just feel that
you can do it better.

40:45.710 --> 40:50.078
In my country, when we did copy,
we signed our name in the back

40:50.180 --> 40:51.547
of the painting.

40:51.649 --> 40:53.149
Could I do that?

40:53.250 --> 40:54.367
No.

40:57.438 --> 40:59.472
I'm really not that good.

40:59.574 --> 41:03.025
I don't know how to
paint like Van Gogh.

41:03.127 --> 41:06.362
I don't want you to
paint like Van Gogh.

41:06.464 --> 41:11.384
I want to you to paint
like you are Van Gogh.

41:13.621 --> 41:15.354
Could I think about it?

41:15.456 --> 41:16.956
Of course.

41:17.058 --> 41:20.743
And Alice, whatever
you decide, it's okay.

41:22.597 --> 41:24.497
Oh, I've been thinking.

41:24.599 --> 41:26.632
Eventually, you're going
to need some visas.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.368
For you, Ken, and your father.

41:29.470 --> 41:31.103
We are not going to
have him coming over

41:31.205 --> 41:32.238
in a containership.

41:32.340 --> 41:33.672
I'll work on it.

41:38.212 --> 41:40.312
Have you seen this girl?

41:40.414 --> 41:41.680
No.

41:42.733 --> 41:44.250
Sir, have you seen this girl?

41:44.352 --> 41:46.402
Take a good look.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.336
Nothing at all?

41:47.438 --> 41:48.737
Thank you.

41:50.491 --> 41:51.674
Miss, have you seen this girl?

41:51.776 --> 41:53.475
Has she ever bought
anything from you here?

41:53.578 --> 41:55.143
Anything at all?

41:55.245 --> 41:55.611
Okay.

41:55.713 --> 41:57.546
Thank you.

41:57.648 --> 41:58.513
How about you, miss?

41:58.616 --> 42:00.148
You ever seen her
around the market place?

42:00.250 --> 42:02.718
I'm just trying
to ID her, please?

42:31.798 --> 42:33.598
What are you doing, Picasso?

42:35.602 --> 42:36.635
Leaving.

42:36.737 --> 42:38.170
What?

42:38.272 --> 42:40.172
You want to run away again?

42:40.274 --> 42:41.140
Not running away.

42:41.242 --> 42:41.773
I'm leaving.

42:41.875 --> 42:43.575
There is a difference.

42:43.677 --> 42:46.512
And, you will be going where?

42:46.613 --> 42:47.579
It doesn't matter.

42:47.681 --> 42:50.349
We'll be fine wherever we go.

42:50.451 --> 42:51.183
We?

42:51.285 --> 42:51.650
We are not leaving.

42:51.752 --> 42:53.319
You are leaving.

42:53.421 --> 42:53.819
Ken!

42:53.921 --> 42:54.653
Listen to me.

42:54.755 --> 42:57.322
Something is not right.

42:57.458 --> 42:57.857
What?

42:57.925 --> 42:59.358
I don't know.

43:00.494 --> 43:01.660
Is it...

43:01.762 --> 43:02.545
Did he?

43:02.647 --> 43:03.679
No.

43:03.781 --> 43:05.514
Then?

43:07.852 --> 43:09.634
He wants me to paint a Van Gogh.

43:09.654 --> 43:10.686
So what?

43:10.788 --> 43:13.489
You did it at home all the time.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.690
It's different here.

43:14.792 --> 43:17.559
I just don't feel right.

43:17.662 --> 43:18.694
I don't get it.

43:18.796 --> 43:22.314
Why does it matter if you
paint flowers or Picasso?

43:22.416 --> 43:24.083
Nothing.

43:24.185 --> 43:27.436
You want to run away just
because you don't feel right?

43:27.538 --> 43:29.405
Just trust me.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.490
I'm not going anywhere.

43:32.593 --> 43:34.626
Ken, you're coming with me.

43:34.729 --> 43:36.412
Dad put me in charge of you.

43:36.414 --> 43:38.580
Get your things together.

43:38.682 --> 43:39.715
Dad is not here.

43:39.817 --> 43:41.784
And I'm not leaving.

43:41.886 --> 43:43.452
Do you want to go
back to the streets?

43:43.554 --> 43:48.256
Are you crazy?

43:48.358 --> 43:52.260
Alice, this is everything
you ever wanted.

43:52.362 --> 43:53.595
A place to paint.

43:53.698 --> 43:56.264
To be an artist.

43:56.366 --> 43:58.417
This is your dream come true.

43:59.553 --> 44:00.719
But, Ken.

44:00.821 --> 44:03.588
It's still just a dream.

44:03.690 --> 44:05.541
None of this is ours.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.476
But, it can be ours.

44:07.578 --> 44:08.677
Listen to me.

44:08.695 --> 44:10.495
Just listen, Alice.

44:10.597 --> 44:15.283
He is giving you, me,
the chance of a lifetime.

44:15.385 --> 44:18.620
I don't know why he is
doing it and I don't care.

44:18.723 --> 44:20.539
I just know he likes us.

44:20.641 --> 44:21.740
He's nice to us.

44:21.842 --> 44:24.276
And he wants to help.

44:24.378 --> 44:27.579
Besides, how else would
we ever get dad here?

44:36.808 --> 44:38.840
So, he doesn't want
to get into your pants.

44:38.943 --> 44:39.624
No.

44:39.726 --> 44:41.443
Is he gay?

44:41.545 --> 44:42.510
No.

44:42.613 --> 44:44.312
Well then, he wants
to get into your pants.

44:44.414 --> 44:45.480
No, he doesn't.

44:45.583 --> 44:46.665
Look, my dear.

44:46.767 --> 44:49.834
If he doesn't want to get
into your pants, he is gay.

44:49.936 --> 44:53.439
And if he isn't gay, he
wants to get into your pants.

44:53.540 --> 44:55.441
That's the way it has
always been since the

44:55.542 --> 44:57.326
beginning of time.

44:57.428 --> 44:58.327
Men are pigs.

44:58.429 --> 44:59.395
No, he's not.

44:59.496 --> 45:00.329
Then...

45:00.431 --> 45:02.331
He's just nice.

45:02.433 --> 45:03.816
Maybe, then, he's a eunich.

45:03.884 --> 45:07.603
He doesn't want anything
from me, except that painting.

45:07.705 --> 45:08.671
A Van Gogh?

45:08.773 --> 45:09.872
Off with his ear?

45:09.974 --> 45:11.890
Like the one we
saw in the museum?

45:11.992 --> 45:13.458
That I had to
drag you away from?

45:13.561 --> 45:15.461
I've never seen
a real one before.

45:15.563 --> 45:16.312
Sure.

45:16.414 --> 45:16.812
But...

45:16.914 --> 45:18.347
It was so alive.

45:18.449 --> 45:22.584
The brush strokes, the
colors, the mix of colors,

45:22.686 --> 45:26.355
And, you know, the branch
seems to be breathing.

45:26.457 --> 45:27.689
It was a swell branch.

45:27.792 --> 45:29.208
I agree.

45:29.310 --> 45:31.610
If only I could
ever be that good.

45:31.662 --> 45:33.496
What's wrong?

45:33.598 --> 45:36.698
Maybe, it would
help to train you.

45:36.801 --> 45:39.235
He's been so generous.

45:39.336 --> 45:42.772
But, I don't feel right
copying other people's work.

45:42.874 --> 45:46.642
Look, every artist in
that great big museum had

45:46.744 --> 45:48.577
to start somewhere.

45:48.679 --> 45:52.281
A lot of them had to paint
shit that they didn't like.

45:54.885 --> 45:58.386
You have here what
we call a patron.

45:58.489 --> 46:00.572
Someone who wants
to support you.

46:00.674 --> 46:01.507
So?

46:01.608 --> 46:03.575
So, take what life offers you.

46:03.677 --> 46:06.528
Life gives you lemons,
make lemonade.

46:06.630 --> 46:09.398
But, add a shit load
of vodka, it helps.

46:09.500 --> 46:12.484
Look Alice, it could be worse.

46:22.629 --> 46:23.879
[bell rings]

46:31.606 --> 46:32.621
Hit him!

46:32.723 --> 46:33.321
Watch out.

46:38.512 --> 46:38.777
Yeah!

46:38.879 --> 46:40.328
Get him!

47:30.013 --> 47:34.433
[cheers & applause]

47:35.853 --> 47:37.519
Well, that's two down.

47:47.047 --> 47:48.514
You got the door?

47:49.583 --> 47:51.617
Thanks.

47:51.718 --> 47:54.886
Yeah, with your agility and
your low center of gravity Ken,

47:54.988 --> 47:57.922
you got a chance of becoming
something really special, okay.

48:00.794 --> 48:01.960
Take this, huh?

48:02.062 --> 48:03.695
You deserve it.

48:03.797 --> 48:05.497
See you on Thursday?

48:05.599 --> 48:07.666
You mean I get to do it again?

48:11.939 --> 48:12.755
Yeah, sure.

48:12.823 --> 48:14.206
You bet.

48:27.037 --> 48:28.437
Where have you been?

48:31.625 --> 48:32.924
Where did you get this from?

48:33.027 --> 48:33.858
I found it on the street.

48:33.960 --> 48:35.927
It fell from a big tree.

48:36.030 --> 48:38.730
I told you money grows on trees.

48:38.832 --> 48:40.149
Ken, seriously.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.817
Tell me, where did
you get this from?

48:41.919 --> 48:44.887
Well, I'm working for Elizabeth.

48:44.989 --> 48:46.054
At the diner.

48:46.056 --> 48:47.940
Doing what?

48:48.042 --> 48:53.011
You know, washing dishes,
taking orders, cooking food.

48:53.113 --> 48:54.145
Stuff like that.

48:54.247 --> 48:56.131
Cooking food?

48:56.133 --> 48:56.748
Sure sis.

48:56.850 --> 48:58.550
This is America.

48:58.652 --> 49:01.820
Anybody can do
anything they want.

49:01.922 --> 49:04.039
And you got this
much from one night?

49:04.141 --> 49:05.123
Sure sis.

49:05.225 --> 49:06.841
Everybody likes me.

49:06.943 --> 49:08.043
I made them laugh.

49:08.145 --> 49:11.446
They gave me good tip.

49:11.548 --> 49:14.716
And since you haven't sold any
paintings yet, I should bring

49:14.818 --> 49:15.400
in the bucks.

49:15.419 --> 49:16.785
Don't you think, Alice?

49:16.887 --> 49:18.721
You're sweaty.

49:18.823 --> 49:19.588
What?

49:19.690 --> 49:21.457
I was working really hard.

49:21.559 --> 49:24.926
Besides, I went to
Sullivan's gym today.

49:25.028 --> 49:26.729
I mean, Mr. Sullivan.

49:26.831 --> 49:29.130
I heard you were at
the gym today Ken.

49:29.233 --> 49:32.000
And that everyone was
very impressed with you.

49:32.102 --> 49:32.768
Have you been fighting?

49:32.870 --> 49:34.069
Nah, there is no fighting there.

49:34.171 --> 49:35.003
It's just a gym.

49:35.105 --> 49:36.004
A couple of punching bags.

49:36.106 --> 49:37.639
That sort of thing, huh?

49:38.809 --> 49:42.744
We should all get some sleep
because tomorrow I will start

49:42.846 --> 49:44.046
a new painting.

49:52.106 --> 49:53.739
Not anything titanium.

49:53.841 --> 49:55.741
The paint I'm looking
for has lead in it.

49:55.843 --> 49:57.843
It's becoming more she-she.

49:57.845 --> 49:59.627
Organic paint is what I call it.

49:59.729 --> 50:00.795
No additives.

50:00.897 --> 50:02.964
Kind of like the way the
old masters used to do it.

50:03.067 --> 50:04.899
It's very expensive.

50:05.001 --> 50:07.035
Do you remember
anyone buying it?

50:07.137 --> 50:08.903
Well, it's not the
students for sure.

50:09.005 --> 50:10.038
They can't afford it.

50:10.140 --> 50:12.857
And, who wants lead poisoning?

50:12.959 --> 50:15.076
Wait here, I got
some in back.

50:32.212 --> 50:35.997
Why are Sizzly Colors different?

50:35.999 --> 50:39.034
We use genuine historical
pigments like the ones used by

50:39.136 --> 50:39.934
the old masters.

50:40.036 --> 50:41.904
Blah, blah, blah.

50:41.906 --> 50:43.054
No modern additives.

50:43.156 --> 50:47.058
The character found in each tube
of our oil colors is unique.

50:47.160 --> 50:51.196
Giving the artist new
choices of texture, opacity,

50:51.298 --> 50:54.533
consistency, tone, and hue.

50:54.635 --> 50:57.819
You experience the
transparencies of yellow ochre..

50:57.922 --> 50:59.254
That's what I want!

50:59.256 --> 51:00.689
Huh?

51:00.791 --> 51:03.325
I mean, excuse me.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.477
I need that kind of paint.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.812
That's what I was looking for.

51:07.915 --> 51:09.697
Please, I'd like to
look around some more.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.800
That young lady
knows what she wants.

51:13.186 --> 51:14.018
Any particular color?

51:14.120 --> 51:15.286
All of them!

51:15.339 --> 51:17.705
Young lady, you know
what these cost?

51:17.807 --> 51:19.207
No, but it doesn't matter.

51:19.309 --> 51:20.875
I'll take them.

51:26.283 --> 51:28.283
Can I ask you a question?

51:30.154 --> 51:31.837
Yeah, sure.

51:31.939 --> 51:34.105
Do you want to
get into my pants?

51:34.158 --> 51:35.723
Excuse me?

51:35.825 --> 51:37.992
I... no.

51:38.094 --> 51:40.178
Are you gay?

51:40.280 --> 51:41.479
No.

51:43.967 --> 51:45.767
Then, you must be eunich.

51:49.156 --> 51:50.856
Thank you.

51:50.958 --> 51:51.823
Goodbye.

51:56.913 --> 51:59.063
[laughs] So much for
discretion, detective.

51:59.165 --> 52:01.199
I did my part perfectly.

52:01.301 --> 52:03.018
Nevermind.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.085
Her.

52:04.188 --> 52:05.754
Was she ever in here?

52:05.856 --> 52:07.022
Did she ever...

52:07.124 --> 52:08.823
Good God, she looks dead.

52:08.925 --> 52:09.891
She is.

52:09.993 --> 52:11.193
She was.

52:11.295 --> 52:12.161
She did.

52:12.263 --> 52:15.030
Same thing as the
girl that was just here.

52:15.132 --> 52:16.031
An Asian thing.

52:16.133 --> 52:17.032
Don't you think?

52:17.134 --> 52:19.334
If she comes back, you call me.

52:34.885 --> 52:36.217
Alice.

53:04.915 --> 53:05.914
Mr. Gilani.

53:06.016 --> 53:06.414
Yes.

53:06.516 --> 53:08.083
Justus Sullivan.

53:08.185 --> 53:09.952
Fine, thank you.

53:10.054 --> 53:11.252
Good news.

53:12.122 --> 53:13.254
Yes.

53:14.191 --> 53:15.290
The Van Gogh.

53:16.927 --> 53:19.294
A couple of weeks, perhaps.

53:19.396 --> 53:22.730
Oh, you will not
be disappointed.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.133
Good.

53:27.071 --> 53:27.970
Thanks.

53:28.072 --> 53:29.037
Come again.

53:29.139 --> 53:30.973
Oh wow.

53:31.075 --> 53:33.108
My favorite Asian painter.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.042
This is for you.

53:34.144 --> 53:34.843
Huh?

53:34.945 --> 53:36.111
Wow.

53:36.213 --> 53:37.913
Thank you for the good advice.

53:38.015 --> 53:38.981
Really?

53:39.083 --> 53:40.849
For me?

53:40.951 --> 53:43.118
Just what I always wanted.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.119
What is it?

53:44.221 --> 53:46.855
Kidding, kidding.

53:46.957 --> 53:48.991
Oh...

53:49.093 --> 53:51.059
It's lovely!

53:51.161 --> 53:52.861
Thank you.

53:54.098 --> 53:56.998
Ah, we're gonna put it right
over there with a big sign,

53:57.100 --> 53:59.501
painted by Alice Qiang.

53:59.603 --> 54:02.286
Elizabeth, there
is another eunich.

54:02.288 --> 54:03.472
Huh?

54:03.574 --> 54:05.907
The guy that just came in.

54:07.027 --> 54:07.458
You are following me.

54:07.560 --> 54:08.493
No, I'm not.

54:08.595 --> 54:10.562
Kick his lying ass, Asian girl!

54:13.149 --> 54:13.448
Stop.

54:14.351 --> 54:15.049
Stop.

54:15.102 --> 54:15.567
Stop.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.202
Okay, please stop.

54:17.304 --> 54:18.870
I am following you.

54:18.972 --> 54:20.872
I'm interested in an Asian girl.

54:20.974 --> 54:21.873
Pervert!

54:21.975 --> 54:23.792
No, no, not like that.

54:25.245 --> 54:27.078
Let me explain.

54:27.180 --> 54:32.016
Are we supposed to believe
that this is legitimate?

54:32.119 --> 54:35.153
I'm a homicide detective
investigating the murder of a

54:35.255 --> 54:37.071
female Asian painter.

54:47.334 --> 54:49.050
Why are you following me?

54:49.152 --> 54:50.185
Because you are a painter.

54:50.287 --> 54:51.386
How do you know?

54:51.488 --> 54:54.289
Because you were in the
art store buying oil paints.

54:54.391 --> 54:55.490
He's good.

54:55.492 --> 54:58.126
The other girl that was
murdered, also a painter.

54:58.128 --> 55:01.062
So, she was Asian
and she painted.

55:01.164 --> 55:03.982
What does that
have to do with me?

55:04.084 --> 55:05.917
Perhaps, you're in
danger of the same fate.

55:06.019 --> 55:08.253
Why don't you come down
to the station with me?

55:08.355 --> 55:09.387
I'd rather not.

55:09.489 --> 55:12.057
And, I'd like you to leave now.

55:12.159 --> 55:15.193
You heard what she said,
get out of my restaurant.

55:15.295 --> 55:18.063
What if you're already in danger
and you don't know it yet?

55:18.165 --> 55:20.364
Well, I guess
I'll find out soon.

55:22.302 --> 55:25.937
Well, when you do,
let me know about it.

55:26.039 --> 55:27.505
You may need my help.

55:31.044 --> 55:32.477
Why did you call him a eunich?

55:32.579 --> 55:36.081
Well, he isn't gay and
he doesn't want to get

55:36.182 --> 55:37.249
into my pants.

56:22.295 --> 56:23.561
Impressive.

56:24.297 --> 56:26.564
Very impressive.

56:27.367 --> 56:28.900
You scared me.

56:34.124 --> 56:35.290
Thank you.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.358
You're very good
at this, you know.

56:37.461 --> 56:39.060
Painting?

56:40.263 --> 56:41.429
Or copying?

56:41.531 --> 56:44.532
Well, I would say both.

56:44.635 --> 56:48.286
It teaches me to do this.

56:48.388 --> 56:50.455
I'm not as bold in my own work.

56:51.525 --> 56:53.325
So, when do you think?

56:54.328 --> 56:55.493
This?

56:55.596 --> 56:57.045
Yes?

56:57.147 --> 56:58.479
Three days.

56:59.616 --> 57:00.932
Maybe two.

57:24.441 --> 57:27.208
Okay, just like before, okay?

57:27.310 --> 57:28.410
You got this.

57:28.512 --> 57:30.361
Just make sure he gets through.

57:32.515 --> 57:35.450
I think this kid
is the real thing.

57:35.552 --> 57:39.086
We do things a little different
after hours here, folks.

57:39.188 --> 57:41.756
No rounds, no judges.

57:41.858 --> 57:45.276
The fight will continue
until one man can't stand.

57:45.378 --> 57:48.546
To my right, standing six foot
four, two hundred and sixty

57:48.648 --> 57:50.348
pounds from Chicago.

57:50.450 --> 57:51.449
The infamous Hannibal.

57:51.551 --> 57:52.650
[cheers & applause]

57:52.752 --> 57:57.238
To my left, standing five foot
six, a slight one hundred

57:57.340 --> 57:58.439
and sixty pounds.

57:58.441 --> 58:00.108
Ken Qiang.

58:00.377 --> 58:01.125
Fighters!

58:01.227 --> 58:03.360
This is your last chance
to place bets, people.

58:03.463 --> 58:05.096
One to one odds.

58:05.198 --> 58:06.097
Fighters to the center.

58:06.199 --> 58:07.131
Let's touch hands.

58:09.268 --> 58:10.685
Alright.

58:10.787 --> 58:12.286
Alright, let's see some blood.

59:55.308 --> 59:56.373
[arm snapping]

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.267
That's it.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:08.136
Get back.

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:14.142
Nice work.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.279
Good job, kid.

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.516
I knew I could take him.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:22.717
Even before we started.

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:25.403
He's way too big, way too slow.

01:00:25.471 --> 01:00:28.506
I see a promising
career ahead of you, Ken.

01:00:28.608 --> 01:00:30.241
Don't tell Alice, though.

01:00:31.344 --> 01:00:33.677
She's gonna know something
from the look of you.

01:00:41.487 --> 01:00:42.386
Where were you?

01:00:42.488 --> 01:00:43.687
I'm going to sleep in my room.

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:44.388
It's late.

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:45.723
Don't want to keep you up.

01:00:45.825 --> 01:00:47.391
Good night.

01:00:47.493 --> 01:00:48.726
You're not going anywhere.

01:00:48.828 --> 01:00:50.528
Get in here.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.281
You've been fighting.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.600
Alice, I swear...

01:00:55.602 --> 01:00:56.401
You're lying.

01:00:56.502 --> 01:00:57.451
Working out.

01:00:57.553 --> 01:00:58.486
Not fighting.

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.488
And you get bruises like
this from working out?

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.872
No!

01:01:01.974 --> 01:01:03.441
I got this.

01:01:03.543 --> 01:01:04.491
And this.

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:05.727
And this.

01:01:10.399 --> 01:01:12.684
You aren't the only
one who can work, Alice.

01:01:12.786 --> 01:01:16.687
I have something I can
do and I'm going to do it.

01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:18.756
But, you promised me...

01:01:18.858 --> 01:01:20.625
I know.

01:01:20.726 --> 01:01:23.294
But, I take it back.

01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:25.429
It was not a good reason
to make a promise.

01:01:25.532 --> 01:01:27.515
Those guys would have hurt you.

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:31.219
If you didn't know how to fight,
you wouldn't be here.

01:01:37.677 --> 01:01:41.195
Alice, this is who we are.

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:44.715
This is what we learned
from our grandfather.

01:01:44.817 --> 01:01:46.718
This is what I have.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.235
All I have.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:51.472
I'm not smart like you.

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:56.477
I don't want to go to college
and I can't talk about art.

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:58.896
I wanted everything
to be different here.

01:02:01.701 --> 01:02:04.536
I see you painting, Alice.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:07.888
Doing what you were born to do.

01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:11.642
Let me do what I was born to do.

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:23.771
So, you are not
working for Elizabeth?

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.540
Nah, she's my cover.

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.958
We're by appointment only.

01:02:45.745 --> 01:02:47.645
I have a 1:30 pm appointment.

01:02:47.747 --> 01:02:49.680
Oh, let me check.

01:02:54.621 --> 01:02:57.404
It doesn't seem to be here.

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.405
My mistake.

01:02:58.508 --> 01:02:58.873
I'm sorry.

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:00.441
Thank you.

01:03:18.511 --> 01:03:20.578
My friend will be most pleased.

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.637
It's good.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.569
Mr. Johnson.

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.571
Oh, I wasn't expecting
you till later.

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:45.006
I'll make you something.

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:46.140
Thank you.

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.777
Alice, I have some
very good news.

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:50.878
Here.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:52.680
What is this?

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.449
This afternoon, we sold
one of your paintings.

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:58.585
I know you don't have a bank
account yet, so, I brought you

01:05:58.688 --> 01:05:59.854
your share in cash.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:03.674
$1900 minus the
galleries commission.

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:08.762
So, that's close to
a thousand dollars!

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:09.197
Alice!

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:09.697
Which painting?

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:11.082
Who bought it?

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.151
The one showing the young
Chinese girl playing the flute.

01:06:14.253 --> 01:06:15.069
Woohoo!

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.821
Alright!

01:06:16.923 --> 01:06:17.488
Who is the buyer?

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:18.806
Do you know their name?

01:06:18.824 --> 01:06:22.109
Well, it was bought by a
nice young woman who was a...

01:06:22.161 --> 01:06:23.093
I want to meet her!

01:06:23.195 --> 01:06:23.728
Why?

01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:24.928
Ken, sit down.

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:25.797
To thank her.

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.865
Besides, if somebody
has something I made,

01:06:27.967 --> 01:06:29.700
it means we are
connected in some way.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:30.884
Well...

01:06:30.986 --> 01:06:33.754
Thank you Mr. Sullivan,
Mr. Sullivan Justus.

01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:35.022
That's very nice, Alice.

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:37.024
Can I meet her tomorrow?

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:38.942
That's not how the
professional world works.

01:06:39.011 --> 01:06:39.877
Can I come too?

01:06:39.979 --> 01:06:41.879
You don't need to thank her.

01:06:41.981 --> 01:06:43.747
She's been rewarded
by your painting.

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:44.849
- Besides...
- We can buy her flowers.

01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:45.817
No, I'm sorry.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:49.486
Justus, can we please,
please meet her?

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:50.822
This is the first
painting I ever sold.

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:51.923
No!

01:06:57.646 --> 01:07:00.915
People who buy art value
their privacy, Alice.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:05.119
My job is to take care of the
client as well as the artist.

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.904
Please, don't make
that difficult for me.

01:07:08.007 --> 01:07:08.639
I'm sorry.

01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:10.224
I didn't mean to.

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:11.125
Thank you Mr. Sullivan.

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:12.943
We're very sorry.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.065
Excuse me, Mrs. Ryan.

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:18.332
I won't be eating after all.

01:07:18.417 --> 01:07:20.651
I just remembered, I have
a conference call in a

01:07:20.753 --> 01:07:21.818
couple of minutes.

01:07:35.735 --> 01:07:36.400
Tada!

01:07:36.502 --> 01:07:38.969
You're looking at a paid artist!

01:07:39.072 --> 01:07:40.988
What on earth?

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.690
I sold my first painting!

01:07:43.792 --> 01:07:46.793
That's wonderful.

01:07:49.248 --> 01:07:51.732
Elizabeth, I'll come
back another time.

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:52.182
No, Alice.

01:07:52.284 --> 01:07:53.301
Stay right here.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.753
I asked him to be
here when you came.

01:07:55.855 --> 01:07:57.421
Why?

01:07:57.523 --> 01:07:59.089
Because I'm worried about you.

01:07:59.191 --> 01:08:00.825
Alice, listen to me.

01:08:00.927 --> 01:08:03.127
That girl who was murdered,
I believe she was

01:08:03.196 --> 01:08:04.295
painting for someone.

01:08:04.397 --> 01:08:06.981
Someone that was paying
her to paint forgeries.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:08.866
So, what does that
have to do with me?

01:08:08.934 --> 01:08:11.836
That girl seems
she had a patron.

01:08:11.937 --> 01:08:14.839
They found her bag yesterday
about a mile off the port,

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.174
with $18,000 cash.

01:08:17.277 --> 01:08:18.242
So what?

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:19.910
Alice, don't pretend with him.

01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:20.977
He's okay.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.596
He's just trying to help.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.134
Everyone here is
just trying to help.

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:29.002
No, he's a eunich.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.004
What is it with
you two and eunichs?

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.072
It's our secret code.

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:33.907
It means...

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:37.144
You're okay.

01:08:43.102 --> 01:08:45.019
Thanks for coming with me.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.604
Did I have a choice?

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:49.006
There's a lot of money
in art forgeries, Alice.

01:08:49.108 --> 01:08:50.756
And they need people like you.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:52.160
You mean, stupid people.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.278
No, talented people.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.761
You don't know I'm talented.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.031
I do.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.883
I saw your paintings
at the gallery.

01:08:58.984 --> 01:08:59.750
I know.

01:08:59.852 --> 01:09:01.885
You saw my paintings?

01:09:01.988 --> 01:09:02.886
Yes.

01:09:02.988 --> 01:09:06.890
It was a babbling brook,
a field of flowers,

01:09:06.993 --> 01:09:09.176
and the third one was what?

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:12.179
A young Asian girl
playing the flute.

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.215
And very colorful.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:15.983
What?

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:17.901
Nothing.

01:09:18.004 --> 01:09:20.638
Has he asked you to copy
someone else's work?

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:25.176
He knows many Asian painters
are skilled at copying.

01:09:25.278 --> 01:09:27.794
Have you ever copied a
famous painting, Alice?

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.263
Yes, at my father's shop.

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:31.131
I thought so.

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.015
I need to go now.

01:09:32.118 --> 01:09:33.183
Wake up, Alice!

01:09:33.286 --> 01:09:36.069
Just because you're innocent,
doesn't mean everyone is.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.939
These are dangerous people
who'll do anything for money.

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:41.008
I think you're
just out to get us.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:43.211
Finally, something good
happened to me and my brother.

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:45.328
And you're trying to ruin it.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:48.932
You don't know how hard it
is and how hungry we are.

01:09:49.035 --> 01:09:50.300
That's what they're counting on.

01:09:50.402 --> 01:09:53.937
Your hunger to make it and your
belief that you deserve this.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.941
But, but, but, don't I?

01:09:58.043 --> 01:10:00.294
You really believe
that's how it works?

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:01.828
It's America.

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.898
Anyone can make it.

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:04.965
Bullshit.

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.300
It's not real, Alice.

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.102
And I think you know that.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.703
I know you're illegal.

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.689
I could bring you in
for that right now.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:13.957
But, I need you to
help me to get Sullivan.

01:10:14.059 --> 01:10:16.843
Because that other girl,
she didn't deserve to die.

01:10:16.945 --> 01:10:19.813
And besides, it
could have been you.

01:10:25.071 --> 01:10:27.972
<i>Instead, they proposed using
the ratio of employing people</i>

01:10:28.074 --> 01:10:31.374

<i>Today, news from the art world.</i>

01:10:33.345 --> 01:10:36.847
A noted antiquities and oil
painting expert was arrested

<i>charged with criminal fraud.</i>

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:42.719
<i>The expert, Brad Johnson, of
Seattle, is accused of falsely</i>

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:45.388
and authenticating scores of
paintings and sculptures.

01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:47.991
One of the counterfeited
paintings currently hangs in

01:10:49.695 --> 01:10:51.411

Everyone?

01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:58.251
Everyone!

01:10:58.303 --> 01:10:58.903
Yes, sir.

Can I have some?

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:23.477
Hey.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:27.932
Fine.

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.232
And the shit has hit the fence.

[doorbell rings]

01:12:07.507 --> 01:12:08.972
I'll get it.

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:38.235
Justus Sullivan.

01:12:38.337 --> 01:12:39.536
Where is he?

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.451
What do you think you're doing?

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:11.351
I don't understand.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:13.287
Let's talk about this.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.155
Let's sit down
and talk about this.

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:16.557
How can I help you?

01:13:16.659 --> 01:13:19.026
What seems to be the problem?

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.561
You neglected to tell
me something about the

01:13:20.663 --> 01:13:24.314
painting I paid you
$22 million for isn't real.

01:13:24.383 --> 01:13:27.201
If it is not,
I was fooled as well.

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.502
Who painted it?

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:29.586
Him?

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:32.289
I don't like being cheated.

01:13:32.391 --> 01:13:34.441
More than that, I don't
like being played for a fool.

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:36.393
I want my money now!

Kill the kid!

Alice, he lied to us.

Alice, I didn't.

It wasn't real, was it?

Alice, please.

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:15.342
Help me.

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:26.680
If they find you here,
you'll be deported.

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:27.615
Go to the restaurant.

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:28.348
Now!

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:30.517
I need to get my paintings!

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.853
Alice, come on!

01:16:33.439 --> 01:16:34.237
Hurry!

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:03.550
Can I get an omelette?

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:07.520
With no cheese, and
keep onions on the side.

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:07.921
Okay.

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:09.239
Yeah.

01:17:09.341 --> 01:17:11.641
Oh, well, here he is.

01:17:11.743 --> 01:17:14.328
Mr. Nick Thompson himself.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:18.131
Hello Nick!

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:20.917
Alice, you better
come on over here.

01:17:23.489 --> 01:17:24.871
Are you here to arrest me?

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:26.807
Well, I don't see what
good that would do.

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:28.575
You didn't know what
Sullivan planned to do with

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:30.744
your painting, did you Alice?

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:33.480
I might have.

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:34.414
I don't know.

01:17:34.684 --> 01:17:35.582
Alice...

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.652
He told me not to sign my name
in the back of the painting.

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.288
But, you did sign.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.290
So, that means you're innocent.

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:46.810
Well, here is what I'm thinking.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:48.562
Not sure if I'm right
about this or not.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.413
You tell me.

01:17:50.515 --> 01:17:52.482
Because I believe you
kids were in on this thing

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:53.616
the entire time.

01:17:53.718 --> 01:17:55.551
- What?
- Huh?

01:17:55.654 --> 01:17:58.288
You were working with me
starting from a few days

01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:59.256
after you arrived.

01:17:59.357 --> 01:18:02.309
I got Elizabeth
backing me up on that.

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:05.512
The night she was robbed,
we met that night.

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:08.448
And you two went
undercover for the city

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.783
of Seattle Police Department.

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:10.634
Isn't that right?

01:18:10.736 --> 01:18:13.336
Oh, I was right here
when it happened.

01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:16.440
In fact, I made a point of
noting it the first time you

01:18:16.542 --> 01:18:18.458
were here in the
restaurant, Alice.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.527
It was good thinking, Elizabeth.

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:21.795
Now, Alice.

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:25.499
Did Sullivan say anything
about sponsoring you and Ken?

01:18:25.601 --> 01:18:26.900
Yes.

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:32.672
Well, I just so happened to be
the first one to go through all

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:34.340
of his mail.

01:18:34.442 --> 01:18:38.611
But, I don't think
these belong to him.

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:42.866
I think they belong to you.

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:44.217
You saved her life.

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:46.619
Heck, you even saved
my life that night.

01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:48.688
This is the least the
United States of America

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.257
can do for you.

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.861
Welcome to America!

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:02.636
In the meantime, you two
can go on staying with me.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.371
It's going great so far.

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:08.508
And besides, I don't
have children on my own.

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:12.946
And someday, someone's
gonna have to run this place.

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:15.766
Excuse me.

01:19:15.868 --> 01:19:18.618
Who can I talk to
about these paintings?

01:19:23.675 --> 01:19:25.375
We love this one.

01:19:25.477 --> 01:19:26.376
That's my favorite.

01:19:26.478 --> 01:19:26.910
Thank you.

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:27.344
It's beautiful.

01:19:27.446 --> 01:19:28.044
Thank you!

01:19:28.146 --> 01:19:29.946
What was your inspiration?
