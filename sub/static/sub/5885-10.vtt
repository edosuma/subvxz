WEBVTT

00:43.252 --> 00:47.004
Jaguar, the mistress
who'll do things your wife won't.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.133
What did l say before?

00:50.217 --> 00:51.884
The client doesn't want to
hear the word "mistress."

00:51.969 --> 00:53.886
Salesmen can use it, but the campaign can't.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.099
Jaguar, you'll love it when you're in it.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.935
Are we just spitting up lines now?

01:02.521 --> 01:04.689
You know what? Let's take a break.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.611
Where are you going?

01:10.696 --> 01:13.448
What was unclear about the fact
that he's taking a break and we're not?

01:22.374 --> 01:24.584
l need you to sign off on Secor Laxative.

01:25.711 --> 01:28.588
l told you you were in charge of all
ongoing business till Jaguar's done.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.465
-Just handle it.
-Done.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.301
-How's the prospect doing?
-ls it lunchtime?

01:34.052 --> 01:35.094
Jesus, is it?

01:35.471 --> 01:37.805
Mr. Sterling bought lobster from The Palm.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.682
Doesn't that sound good?

01:40.517 --> 01:41.517
Hey.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.945
So, l don't know
what the Jaguar executives will say.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.490
But l got dealerships in Montclair,

01:55.574 --> 01:58.576
Englewood, Morristown,
Paramus and Rutherford.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.369
And l carry three other foreign cars.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.539
So, frankly, creative
has to be pretty spectacular

02:04.041 --> 02:06.125
or Jaguar is just another word on the sign.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.669
Well, then we have nothing to worry about.

02:09.171 --> 02:11.881
The dealership on the ground floor
of the corporate offices on Madison

02:11.965 --> 02:15.092
has done very well
just having that XK-E in the entrance.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.844
You have to be excited about this car.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.597
Oh, it's a red-hot number.
l'm excited about that.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.974
But l'm a hard man to please.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.102
l always feel like someone
should go the extra mile.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.647
We're open to anything your heart desires.

02:29.066 --> 02:33.402
Well, the other day
when we were all touring your offices,

02:33.487 --> 02:35.863
our guide was a dynamite redhead.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.158
-Joan Harris.
-Built like a B-52.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.452
Yeah, we know who you're talking about.

02:41.537 --> 02:44.163
Well, l sure would like the opportunity
to get to know her better.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.791
Well, a lot of guys would.
But, you know, she's...

02:46.875 --> 02:48.543
She's a very interesting girl.

02:49.419 --> 02:53.130
She's one of these free spirits?
You know, open to ideas?

02:54.716 --> 02:57.176
So you like redheads? l think l know some.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.554
l like that redhead.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.848
And l think she and l

03:01.932 --> 03:05.226
would both welcome the opportunity
to spend a night together.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.272
Well, you could ask her out.
lt wouldn't be a conflict.

03:09.565 --> 03:12.108
No, l'm kind of shy.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.695
All l'm saying is, if it happens,
it would make me happy.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.906
lf it doesn't, well,
no guarantees in life, right?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.288
-Get another round. l'll get it.
-Absolutely not.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.084
-Was that what l think it was?
-Yes, it was.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.461
Why didn't you just let me
tell him she was married?

03:33.005 --> 03:36.090
Because so is he.
And he already knows that.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.926
Well, we wanted to be in the car business.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.810
-You waited up.
-No.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.645
l mean, yes.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.024
l'm going in to read tomorrow
for a really good part.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.817
An audition? Why didn't you call?

03:55.444 --> 03:58.279
Honestly, because l had to go
to 1 0th Avenue to get the script

03:58.363 --> 03:59.864
and then l went and talked to Fanny,

03:59.948 --> 04:01.949
you know, who teaches
my auditioning class.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.118
You're very good at auditions.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.996
Not as good as the girls who get parts.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.042
You know what? Let's talk about your day.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.836
Well, l was gonna watch Carson
and cry myself to sleep.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.381
lt'll come to you. lt always does.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.342
Unless it comes to you.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.761
Do you really want help
or you want to yell at me?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.262
l don't know yet.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.556
What's the strategy?

04:27.476 --> 04:30.645
A Jaguar is beautiful, but unreliable.

04:30.729 --> 04:33.230
lt comes with a tool kit
the size of a typewriter.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.107
You basically have to
own another car to go places.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.527
So we're saying it's your gorgeous mistress.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.949
So a wife is like a Buick in the garage.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.992
We're trying to make a weakness
into a strength.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.203
-We're selling to men.
-No, l got it.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.165
Doesn't being a mistress
make the car immoral?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.000
The word "mistress" won't be in the ad.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.380
l don't know, but it sounds great.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.803
l need to learn some of this.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.305
There goes the act.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.683
One shot, and there goes the tambourine.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.519
You're here early.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.854
What can l do for you?

05:14.690 --> 05:15.982
Nothing.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.151
Nothing, it's just,
l got some bad news last night

05:19.236 --> 05:21.737
and l was hoping you'd help me deliver it.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.489
What happened?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.367
Well, we were having dinner
with Herb Rennet.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.161
l think you met him
the other day, from Jaguar.

05:29.246 --> 05:32.039
-Handsome guy.
-l don't remember any of them.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.166
Well, l don't know what to do.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.627
He basically pledged
he wasn't going to back us.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.421
Why not?

05:39.089 --> 05:41.716
Turns out he wanted something
we're not prepared to give.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.384
Something very unorthodox.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.052
-Good morning.
-Yes?

05:45.679 --> 05:48.389
l'm here. l'm going to get danish.

05:49.933 --> 05:50.975
What does he want?

05:54.062 --> 05:56.772
l feel like l shouldn't even bring this up.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.316
ln fact, l don't know how to bring this up.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.028
But we're going to lose Jaguar unless

06:02.654 --> 06:06.824
an arrangement is made, and it involves you

06:07.909 --> 06:09.702
and, well, Herb.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.164
How did that come up?

06:13.665 --> 06:16.834
He said he was crazy about you
and then he just asked.

06:18.003 --> 06:22.131
And then l thought we were past it,
but right before we put him in a cab,

06:22.215 --> 06:25.134
he said it again and it was quite conditional.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.969
A night with you or no vote.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.097
Well, l'm sorry to hear that.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.810
Anyway, if you can think of some way
to break the news to the company

06:34.895 --> 06:38.022
that we're out of this, l'd really appreciate it.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.107
You're unbelievable.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.359
l'm married.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.278
How would you feel
if someone asked Trudy?

06:45.614 --> 06:47.448
l didn't bring this up. He did.

06:49.367 --> 06:53.454
lf you're not interested in the idea at all,
l appreciate...

06:54.623 --> 06:55.790
lt's just...

06:56.458 --> 06:59.710
lt seems to me that there's something
that could be worth the sacrifice.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.338
We're talking about a night in your life.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.132
We've all had nights in our lives
where we've made mistakes for free.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.593
You're talking about prostitution.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.888
l'm talking about business
at a very high level.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.265
Do you consider Cleopatra a prostitute?

07:14.226 --> 07:15.810
Where do you get this stuff?

07:16.353 --> 07:17.645
She was a queen.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.940
What would it take to make you a queen?

07:22.359 --> 07:24.193
l don't think you could afford it.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.539
This was an act of desperation.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.083
l hope l haven't insulted you.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.085
That's all that matters to me.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.546
l understand.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.301
Scarlett, we're ready.

07:49.719 --> 07:53.472
Now, we can't get Ginsberg out for the call,
so we want you to pretend you're his junior.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.517
-Partner?
-Supervisor.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.688
l have Mr. Rick Swanson
from Chevalier Blanc cologne on speaker.

08:03.608 --> 08:04.984
Hi, Rick. lt's Kenny.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.279
l'm here on a speaker
with Harry Crane and Peggy Olson,

08:08.363 --> 08:10.281
Mr. Ginsberg's supervisor,

08:10.365 --> 08:12.783
and we want to know
why you want to pull the ad.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.660
-Hello, everyone.
-Hi, Rick.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.078
Hello.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.163
We're very happy with the work,

08:17.247 --> 08:19.582
but sales have leveled off
since the holidays.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.127
lt's Harry. And, you know,
Valentine's Day is coming up.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.087
A girl can't get a guy flowers.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.048
Why would a woman buy a man
anything for Valentine's Day?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.344
Rick, it's Peggy.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.221
l think you're right.

08:34.306 --> 08:38.559
The target of "A hard day's night" was men,
but we can easily change that.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.352
How do you do that?

08:45.901 --> 08:46.984
Hello?

08:47.903 --> 08:49.987
What if it's our leatherjacket hero

08:50.071 --> 08:53.157
running down the street
being chased by screaming girls

08:53.241 --> 08:58.120
and instead ofjumping into a bar,
he comes upon Lady Godiva on a horse

08:58.205 --> 09:01.373
as naked as we are allowed to make her?

09:02.500 --> 09:07.963
And he stops short, but she leans down
and picks him up and puts him on the horse

09:08.048 --> 09:09.632
and rides away with him.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.135
What's the tagline?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.764
lt's something about how, you know,

09:18.266 --> 09:21.268
the right woman loves Chevalier Blanc.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.940
So it's exactly the same
except for the ending?

09:26.608 --> 09:28.484
And maybe Paris instead of London.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.695
Ooh-la-la. A French song.

09:38.662 --> 09:39.745
Close the door, please.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.711
Herb Rennet has demanded
to spend a night with Joan.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.463
And l don't mean dinner and dancing.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.344
He just came right out and said that?

09:55.720 --> 09:56.720
Who is he?

09:56.805 --> 09:58.389
He's the head of the Dealers Association.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.974
And l hope you told him to take a long walk.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.017
There's three votes. We only need two.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.019
l thought about that.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.981
But all he has to do is say
he can't sell cars with our campaign

10:07.065 --> 10:09.858
and neither marketing
nor the factory will fight him.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.237
-So?
-So l brought up the subject with Joan.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.823
-You what?
-Now, relax.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.409
She seemed more amused than shocked.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.995
And it's my opinion,
if we brought her the right amount...

10:21.079 --> 10:23.497
So you thought you'd have us in here
for coffee and talk about this?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.666
What's the problem if she's amenable?

10:25.959 --> 10:27.001
She said she'd do it?

10:27.585 --> 10:29.253
She said we couldn't afford it.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.760
She has a husband in Vietnam
and a baby at home.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.762
And the work will be good enough
to win on its own.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.557
-Plus, it's not a guarantee.
-No, it's not.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.518
lt's a guarantee we won't get it if we don't.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.729
You have some nerve to even ask her.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.938
That's right.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.273
And you should be thanking me

10:49.357 --> 10:51.233
because we've come too far
and are too close

10:51.318 --> 10:53.819
to turning this place into what it should be.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.196
Now we're going to walk away?

10:56.573 --> 10:57.614
Over what?

10:58.575 --> 11:01.702
He's one guy and we can win it without him.
End of discussion.

11:05.457 --> 11:08.417
Speaking of one guy,
how does everyone else feel?

11:09.336 --> 11:11.420
l'd love to approach her with, say,

11:12.047 --> 11:14.715
a 1 0 % finder's fee
on the first year's commission.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.093
That's $50,000. A flattering amount
which begs no negotiation.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.597
l'm not going to stand in the way,
but l am not paying for it.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.309
Not even with our Christmas bonuses?

11:26.853 --> 11:29.229
Maybe Jaguar wasn't meant to be?

11:29.856 --> 11:32.900
l say we take our bonuses and move on.

11:33.234 --> 11:37.404
This is a car. You cannot
put a dollar figure on its significance.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.573
Extend our credit line.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.700
Say it's for Jaguar.

11:48.583 --> 11:54.588
Well, why don't l look into it
to see what we can afford

11:54.672 --> 11:58.842
so you may approach her in the morning
with something definitive?

12:00.845 --> 12:04.098
So, we're 75% of this company.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.934
There's no need to create a conspiracy
by having a vote, is there?

12:07.435 --> 12:10.604
Don't fool yourself.
This is some very dirty business.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.067
Let her know she can still say no.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.796
You know what?
We're not doing this mistress thing.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.840
lt's vulgar.
We're going back to racing heritage.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.384
-Why?
-People think writers horse around

12:40.468 --> 12:41.760
because they're coming up with ideas.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.429
But, actually, it's because
they're horsing around.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.722
Now knock off the grab-ass
and give me some lines.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.434
And don't try to reuse these.
They do not apply.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.317
Hey, skipper. You got five seconds?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.320
Five seconds is not
enough time to sit down.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.574
Good news.
Chevalier Blanc wants to do a pool-out.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.535
-Great.
-Peggy was incredible.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.704
She came up with this
Lady Godiva bit on the spot.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.124
But in the end, we're doing
the same ad as before, but in Paris.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.959
The guy has a beret.

13:14.502 --> 13:18.255
Bid it out. Ginsberg should be free by then.
Be nice to get him out of here.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.799
Ginsberg? l thought of this.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.303
-lt's his account.
-So l guess l'm not in charge of everything.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.306
Jesus, Peggy, you know what?

13:27.390 --> 13:29.558
You want to go to Paris? Here.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.518
Go to Paris.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.166
l'm not crying.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.418
l didn't think that.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.214
What, we're all suddenly interested
in each other's lives?

14:01.090 --> 14:03.467
l know for a fact
that Jaguar's not going to happen.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.718
And he probably does, too.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.596
-l don't care.
-l'll get you to Paris.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.224
And if l don't, we'll both get out of here.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.143
You and your stupid pact.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.355
Save the fiction for your stories.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.284
What can l do for you?

14:29.953 --> 14:31.119
May l?

14:39.170 --> 14:43.006
Signing Jaguar would be disastrous
for the financial health of this company.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.426
You have to stop being afraid.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.596
lt would be a defining moment
for our business.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.642
We don't want it that badly.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.605
-All right, get out.
-lt bears discussion.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.692
l don't know what you're talking about.
Now get out.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.403
Well, l'm sorry that there was a discussion.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.324
But when a company
is planning on spending $50,000,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.159
there needs to be a discussion.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.328
You were all in there talking about it?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.956
Why does it matter
if you have no intention of action?

15:16.666 --> 15:19.084
l don't want them to know l was asked.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.922
Roger Sterling participated
in this discussion?

15:24.591 --> 15:25.799
Yes.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.884
He's a partner.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.097
lf you're against it,
why did you tell me that number?

15:32.181 --> 15:33.307
Sounds like a joke.

15:33.891 --> 15:37.394
Because that may be enough money
to turn your head,

15:38.396 --> 15:41.023
and l wanted a chance to discourage you.

15:42.108 --> 15:45.986
lt is a lot of money, Lane.
lt's four times what l make in a year.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.822
l suppose you wouldn't even be tempted.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.782
Well,

15:51.909 --> 15:53.243
if l were,

15:54.245 --> 15:58.123
l would try to avoid the mistake
that l've made my entire life.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.251
Every time someone's asked me
what l wanted,

16:01.336 --> 16:03.337
l've never told them the truth.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.881
And what would you want?

16:06.674 --> 16:08.300
Three years ago,

16:08.551 --> 16:11.928
when l was essential
to the future of this firm,

16:13.097 --> 16:16.516
l settled for much less than l needed.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.020
The cash would only cripple the company

16:21.606 --> 16:24.274
and would do very little
to change your future.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.611
But a partnership

16:27.695 --> 16:31.490
yielding a 5% stake in the company itself

16:33.076 --> 16:37.037
could take care of a woman
and a child for a lifetime.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.335
Here l thought you were trying to stop this
because you have feelings for me.

16:45.213 --> 16:49.091
That's why l'm looking out for your interests
over the company's.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.693
"Good night, nobody.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.611
"Good night, mush.

17:13.408 --> 17:17.411
"And good night to the old lady
whispering 'hush."'

17:24.460 --> 17:25.836
Hey.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.306
How's it going?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.475
You want to help us out?
Throw some taglines at the wall?

17:41.227 --> 17:44.813
How about,
"Jaguar, it's your problem, not mine."

17:47.483 --> 17:49.151
May l speak with you?

17:53.948 --> 17:55.532
So that's Megan.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.826
Be careful what you say. We're best friends.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.206
So, you're wearing your audition dress.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.125
What are you hoping l can do for you?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.461
You noticed.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.804
l've only bad associations
with letting you leave the house in that.

18:18.806 --> 18:22.309
There's probably 20 girls.
And Julia's coming with me.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.853
Plus, he's a fairy.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.863
So whatever this is, it's not for me.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.953
l want to walk in there with confidence.

18:59.180 --> 19:03.183
l could be in a bikini
and you could paint my body with spots.

19:03.434 --> 19:04.893
Jaguar, try to tame it.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.146
-Don't try and tame it.
-Here, kitty, kitty.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.692
So, she just comes and goes
as she pleases, huh?

19:13.569 --> 19:15.320
Ginsberg. What?

19:16.030 --> 19:17.030
Yeah, l got it.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.129
You can unplug that if you want.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.882
Aren't l interrupting
your routine without me?

19:35.967 --> 19:37.133
Don't be cranky.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.137
l was in a great mood when l left work.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.182
Now l'm just exhausted.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.059
So let's go to bed.

19:47.228 --> 19:51.064
lf and when we get Jaguar,
l'm going to need an apartment in the city.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.816
Absolutely not.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.735
lt's an epic poem for me to get home.

19:56.571 --> 19:58.405
And you're dressed for bed at dinner.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.284
Peter, let's stop playing games.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.077
What are you talking about?

20:04.412 --> 20:07.789
l'm tired of competing.
Your love affair with Manhattan is over.

20:08.791 --> 20:12.127
Well, how can you stand living
out here in this cemetery?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.671
There's nothing to do.
There's no good night noises anywhere.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.924
Because l want to raise my child
in the fresh air.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.301
And we should have another on the way.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.553
l mean, it was a miracle the first time
and we're not even trying.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.514
l'm using all my energy
putting my foot down.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.069
lt's 8:00. Where were you?

20:39.113 --> 20:40.614
What's that smell?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.200
The refrigerator is on the fritz.
l had to take everything out.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.744
Did you call someone?

20:46.162 --> 20:47.996
His wife won't let him come here anymore.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.873
l don't want to talk about that.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.376
We can afford to have someone else
fix the refrigerator, for God's sake.

20:53.461 --> 20:57.464
Why won't anyone believe me?
Apolo and l are just friends.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.551
You know what? Just hire someone.

21:01.636 --> 21:04.846
Get a colored girl in here.
They're used to being bossed around.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.974
Do whatever you want.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.644
And what are you doing?

21:10.728 --> 21:13.855
Drying up inside? Because of what? Greg?

21:14.649 --> 21:15.690
l hate him.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.526
l don't want you talking that way
around Kevin.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.863
He's a baby. He doesn't know
that we all wish his father was dead.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.617
Please, stop.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.037
Have you been drinking?

21:29.705 --> 21:30.872
Yes.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.249
Sit down.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.097
Little Murders called.
Four of us got callbacks.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.682
l'm supposed to go meet
the playwright tomorrow.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.976
That's fantastic.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.896
-That's a big deal.
-l know.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.691
You have to promise
you'll come visit every weekend.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.693
You're going to Broadway, not jail.

22:00.027 --> 22:04.364
No, rehearsal starts in Boston in 1 0 days.
Oh, forget it. l'm getting ahead of myself.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.116
Boston?

22:06.200 --> 22:09.869
Yeah, l think there's
eight weeks of rehearsals plus previews.

22:12.707 --> 22:14.791
So you're just gonna leave
for three months?

22:15.209 --> 22:17.335
-lf they want me.
-Well, forget it.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.506
What do you think this is?

22:22.258 --> 22:27.470
You think l'm gonna be a singing waitress.
Maybe put on a show in the laundry room?

22:27.555 --> 22:29.180
l have to go to work.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.434
You never thought about it because
you didn't expect me to make it.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.688
This is the way it works. Now you know.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.401
Just keep doing whatever the hell you want.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.366
Please, come in.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.499
You didn't have to make
an appointment, you know.

22:56.584 --> 22:57.751
Yes, l did.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.629
Tell them l want a partnership,

23:01.714 --> 23:03.214
not silent,

23:03.299 --> 23:05.383
comprising 5% of the business.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.721
-Well...
-There's no negotiation.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.309
Okay.

23:15.269 --> 23:17.479
l want documents by the end of the day.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.481
l don't know if that's possible.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.816
Well, l'm not guaranteeing results.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.903
l don't think he'll have trouble performing.
He's quite ardent.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.197
l meant winning the business.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.657
Yes, of course.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.744
So, l have instructions,
but l don't know how this works

23:32.828 --> 23:34.537
in a practical sense.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.082
The presentation's tomorrow, isn't it?

23:38.459 --> 23:41.795
So l just call him and have him call you?

23:42.713 --> 23:44.130
Probably not.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.841
Well, how do l...

23:47.301 --> 23:50.470
Figure something out.
Do l have to do all of it?

24:03.317 --> 24:04.609
Which one is he?

24:05.569 --> 24:06.736
He's not bad.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.364
He's doing this.

24:15.496 --> 24:16.538
Come in.

24:17.498 --> 24:18.540
l know l'm not a manager,

24:18.624 --> 24:21.000
but it's very hard to get things done
with you in another room.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.336
Well, l obviously have the opposite feeling.

24:24.839 --> 24:26.172
Permission to speak freely?

24:26.715 --> 24:27.799
What?

24:28.801 --> 24:30.760
l know you forbid us
from thinking about the mistress,

24:30.845 --> 24:33.596
but l kept imagining the asshole
who's gonna want this car.

24:33.681 --> 24:36.099
Now he's probably already
got a lot of beautiful things.

24:36.183 --> 24:38.351
Or maybe he thinks the car
will help him get them.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.270
So l can go on?

24:42.523 --> 24:45.984
And one way or another,
what he has isn't enough.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.821
So no matter what,
the first idea has got to be

24:49.905 --> 24:53.032
finally, like, you're getting what you wanted.

24:54.034 --> 24:57.078
The copy is still describing
the car as another woman.

24:57.872 --> 24:59.455
But a woman you can't have,

25:00.457 --> 25:02.625
because they have all
the qualities of a Jaguar.

25:02.960 --> 25:07.714
Good-looking, expensive, fast,
and, frankly, not practical.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.592
l've always been fine with all that.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.051
But what's the line?

25:14.805 --> 25:19.267
"Jaguar. At last, something beautiful
you can truly own."

25:29.820 --> 25:32.405
So he threw the money in your face?

25:33.574 --> 25:35.533
l don't even want to talk about it.

25:37.703 --> 25:41.247
l've never had more responsibility.
l'm on everything but Jaguar.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.167
l worked on Plymouth at N. W. Ayer.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.252
Car guys are a bunch of creeps.

25:46.629 --> 25:48.421
They're all a bunch of creeps.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.924
Could l get some more coffee?

25:53.260 --> 25:54.844
l can never tell, ballerina,

25:54.929 --> 25:57.096
if you're ambitious
or you just like to complain.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.807
Why can't it be both?

26:00.476 --> 26:03.394
Well, if this was about work
and not feelings,

26:03.479 --> 26:04.562
you'd make a move.

26:05.648 --> 26:06.773
You're right.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.692
l could take a couple of meetings

26:09.777 --> 26:11.861
and get an offer
and throw that in Don's face.

26:12.446 --> 26:15.031
Or you can do what everybody else does.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.784
Have a bunch of meetings,
pick a place and leave.

26:18.452 --> 26:19.911
Don't think l haven't thought about it.

26:20.746 --> 26:24.749
Well, you'd get to find out
if you could shine elsewhere.

26:25.668 --> 26:27.126
And l know you can.

26:27.878 --> 26:31.506
And you'd let him know that
you're not some secretary from Brooklyn

26:31.590 --> 26:33.383
who's dying to help out.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.806
l don't know if l can do that.

26:40.307 --> 26:43.309
Sure, you could.
You could hire a headhunter

26:44.520 --> 26:47.272
or you could buy a friend a piece of pie.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.527
Of course, if you do move,

26:52.611 --> 26:55.697
you can't complain
if l gave Draper a call on my own behalf.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.573
What if Don finds out you helped me?

26:58.325 --> 26:59.826
Don's a big boy.

26:59.910 --> 27:03.830
lf he was having this conversation with you
and he wasn't the subject of it,

27:03.914 --> 27:05.832
he'd tell you to leave in a second.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.212
Thanks.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.927
l've seen the campaign
and it's something l couldn't have imagined,

27:18.012 --> 27:19.637
yet exactly what l expected.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.306
Thank you.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.266
And l want you to present
in the fullest confidence.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.518
l think it's a winner.

27:26.228 --> 27:31.190
Well, all l wanted to say was
we've removed all other impediments.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.901
But you do know,
no matter what else goes on,

27:33.986 --> 27:36.321
it's the creative that's going to win this.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.158
Close the door.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.202
lt was four to zero.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.455
You abstained in absentia.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.292
The conversation doesn't end
just because you leave the room.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.752
What did you promise her?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.338
A 5% stake as a voting partner.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.090
Dawn, could you buzz Mrs. Harris?

27:56.884 --> 27:57.884
She's not here.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.679
Actually, Dawn, could you get my things?

28:03.057 --> 28:05.641
Yes, you should be well rested.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.103
l don't want it like this.

28:10.606 --> 28:11.731
lt was her idea.

28:18.572 --> 28:19.655
Hello.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.867
Hello. l'm Don Draper.
l work with Joan. ls she in?

28:22.951 --> 28:24.827
Yes, of course. Please come in.

28:30.793 --> 28:31.876
What?

28:41.053 --> 28:42.595
She'll be right with you.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.765
-l should take your coat.
-l won't be long.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.480
Well, l will leave you two alone.

28:56.819 --> 28:59.153
l'm really sorry to bother you
if this is a bad time.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.740
Well, l was just stepping into the shower,
but how can l help you?

29:03.909 --> 29:06.244
l wanted to tell you that it's not worth it.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.705
And if we don't get Jaguar, so what?

29:10.791 --> 29:13.084
Who wants to be in business
with people like that?

29:19.591 --> 29:21.801
l was told everyone was on board.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.139
l said no and they voted
when l left the room.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.644
You're a good one, aren't you?

29:32.438 --> 29:33.855
So you understand what l'm saying?

29:36.525 --> 29:37.733
Yes, l do.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.320
l'm all right.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.448
And thank you.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.535
So you have a nice night,
and l'm gonna go prepare.

29:58.589 --> 30:01.132
-Say good night to your friend.
-Good luck tomorrow.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.863
You must get tired of hearing
what a beautiful thing this car is.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.283
But l've met a lot
of beautiful women in my life.

30:27.367 --> 30:31.370
And despite their protestations,
they never tire of hearing it.

30:32.915 --> 30:38.461
But when deep beauty is encountered,
it arouses deep emotions

30:39.963 --> 30:42.215
because it creates a desire,

30:43.383 --> 30:46.344
because it is, by nature, unattainable.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.554
You look radiant, Joan.

30:48.639 --> 30:51.057
May l call you Joan? l'm Herb, by the way.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.559
Well, l should hope so.

30:54.061 --> 30:57.313
We're taught to think
that function is all that matters.

30:58.232 --> 31:01.734
But we have a natural longing
for this other thing.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.239
l got you a little something.

31:13.372 --> 31:16.916
l thought a woman with your complexion
would look good in emerald.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.126
When l was driving the E-Type,

31:19.211 --> 31:21.587
l passed a 1 0-year-old boy
in the back window of a station wagon

31:21.672 --> 31:23.381
and l watched his eyes follow.

31:23.924 --> 31:27.718
He'd just seen something he would want
for the rest of his life.

31:29.513 --> 31:33.599
l feel like a sultan ofAraby
and my tent is graced with Helen of Troy.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.311
Those are two different stories.

31:37.813 --> 31:41.774
He'd just seen that unattainable object
speed by just out of reach.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.902
Because they do that, don't they?

31:45.654 --> 31:47.113
Beautiful things.

31:49.283 --> 31:52.618
You know, l don't know how much longer
l can restrain myself.

31:53.704 --> 31:54.954
Let me see them.

32:17.603 --> 32:21.647
Then l thought about a man of some means
reading Playboy or Esquire.

32:22.107 --> 32:27.111
And flipping past the flesh
to the shiny painted curves of this car.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.865
There was no effort to stop his eye.

32:31.241 --> 32:34.827
The difference is he can have a Jaguar.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.167
Well, thank you for a wonderful time.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.712
You're a hell of a gal.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.174
Oh, this car,

32:49.259 --> 32:51.302
this thing, gentlemen,

32:52.721 --> 32:54.472
what price would we pay?

32:54.556 --> 32:56.932
What behavior would we forgive?

32:58.226 --> 33:01.437
lf they weren't pretty,
if they weren't temperamental,

33:02.064 --> 33:05.274
if they weren't beyond our reach
and a little out of our control,

33:05.359 --> 33:07.193
would we love them like we do?

33:09.863 --> 33:11.030
"Jaguar.

33:12.032 --> 33:16.285
"At last, something beautiful
you can truly own."

33:31.009 --> 33:32.051
What?

33:33.053 --> 33:34.553
Mr. Draper is here to see you.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.555
Why'd you tell him l was here?

33:36.973 --> 33:39.350
He's your boss. You should see him.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.701
Well, l will leave you two alone.

34:01.081 --> 34:03.416
l'm really sorry to bother you
if this is a bad time.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.919
Well, l was just stepping into the shower,
but how can l help you?

34:07.671 --> 34:09.922
l wanted to tell you that it's not worth it.

34:11.133 --> 34:13.050
And if we don't get Jaguar, so what?

34:13.802 --> 34:16.262
Who wants to be in business
with people like that?

34:23.812 --> 34:24.895
How'd it go?

34:26.106 --> 34:28.774
-We'll see.
-lt was one of his good ones.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.946
-Come have a drink?
-Maybe later.

34:49.838 --> 34:52.214
-Where are you from?
-New York.

34:55.886 --> 34:57.428
Turn around, please.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.640
Could you step forward, sweetheart,
and turn around, please?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.240
You know, l would have
taken you anywhere.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.618
Well, no one comes in here.
The food's too bad.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.953
We're not actually gonna eat here, are we?

35:23.455 --> 35:24.538
l'm not hungry.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.415
Freddy Rumsen says you are.

35:27.042 --> 35:30.169
And so does Tom Vogel.
You know we have Clearasil.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.880
ln fact, he sung your praises

35:33.006 --> 35:35.591
while he was yelling at me
that the work wasn't as good anymore.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.844
That was my first account.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.181
Everybody else is gonna want to know
if you're married

35:42.265 --> 35:44.350
or planning on having a baby.

35:44.434 --> 35:47.228
And then they're gonna want to know
how much you want to be paid.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.438
But all l want to know is,

35:49.523 --> 35:52.483
you must have heard
some pretty terrible things about me

35:52.567 --> 35:54.026
from Don Draper's mouth.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.737
But why would you want
to play for the other team?

35:57.864 --> 35:59.365
lt's not a game.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.617
lt's my career.

36:02.452 --> 36:04.036
Look, l need a writer.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.455
They don't have to be like me, but...

36:07.123 --> 36:08.833
Do you know anything
about Ralph Waldo Emerson?

36:11.378 --> 36:12.711
From school.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.465
He said that you have to be
a transparent eyeball.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.593
What he meant was,
you have to take in the world

36:19.678 --> 36:20.719
and pass it through you.

36:20.804 --> 36:24.139
l am tired of people who treat this like math.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.018
l looked at your book and l saw somebody

36:28.103 --> 36:31.230
who was writing like
every product was for them.

36:31.606 --> 36:35.985
No clichés, no homilies, no formula.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.196
Well, l had a lot of help.

36:40.073 --> 36:41.490
Everybody does.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.285
So l lied to you.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.204
What do you want to get paid?

36:56.965 --> 36:58.173
Freddy tell you to do this?

37:09.603 --> 37:11.478
You already know you want to go.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.273
You know how much you'll do it for.

37:15.275 --> 37:16.984
And you didn't make me wait.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.279
l'm going do you the same favor.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.584
lf this is your last meeting.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.132
l think l need a chocolate shake.

37:42.636 --> 37:45.971
First day of work ends with
you and me at La Caravelle.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.811
-You're here.
-l'm here.

37:56.816 --> 37:57.816
How'd it go?

38:08.411 --> 38:09.745
How did yours go?

38:11.164 --> 38:12.206
We're waiting to hear.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.500
l bet you were great.

38:15.168 --> 38:16.877
l bet you were, too.

38:18.421 --> 38:22.091
-The difference is l want you to get it.
-Stop it.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.468
Well, you get to disappear for work
whenever you want.

38:25.095 --> 38:28.681
And if l have to choose
between you and that,

38:29.683 --> 38:31.058
l'll choose you.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.521
But l'll hate you for it.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.399
You know l don't want you to fail.

38:38.858 --> 38:39.858
Good.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.361
Because l'm not going to.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.286
Don't run away like that.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.301
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.304
Miss Olson wants to see you.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.890
Peggy, come on in.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.396
-D'Arcy's out.
-Says who?

39:17.814 --> 39:20.941
Arthur's girl told me on the QT.
She said he was in his office crying.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.694
Jaguar is calling
the president of every agency.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.363
-Dancerjust got a big "No, thanks."
-D'Arcy is out, too.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.205
Get the partners in my office
and wait for further instructions.

39:40.670 --> 39:41.962
Roger Sterling's office.

39:43.506 --> 39:44.757
l want all the partners here.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.341
You can't leave him on hold.

39:46.426 --> 39:47.676
Where's Pete?

39:49.679 --> 39:50.929
Just answer it.

39:56.186 --> 39:58.395
Hello? Hugh, how are you this morning?

39:59.939 --> 40:02.274
l'm glad to hear that. We like him, too.

40:04.611 --> 40:07.071
-Well, that is terrific news.
-Bravo.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.031
-This is spectacular.
-Great.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.159
We'll be over this afternoon
to kiss the bride.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.287
He said it wasn't even close.

40:21.294 --> 40:24.713
-Well, congratulations to everyone.
-We got to get champagne.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.673
l promise you they're opening it right now.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.635
Before everybody's too drunk,
l need a list of names.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.721
l promised them we'd staff up immediately
and we're going over there today.

40:32.806 --> 40:36.016
Can't we wait to see what
the scope of the campaign will be?

40:36.101 --> 40:41.188
ls this about the bonuses again?
There are no bonuses this year.

40:41.481 --> 40:43.107
Now, next year...

40:47.862 --> 40:50.280
Joan, shall we address the men?

41:11.678 --> 41:12.803
Congratulations.

41:13.805 --> 41:14.847
You wanted to talk to me?

41:15.723 --> 41:16.974
You're not busy?

41:19.227 --> 41:20.352
l'm not in the mood.

41:21.104 --> 41:23.313
You really have no idea
when things are good, do you?

41:38.037 --> 41:40.080
l swear, l don't really need to talk right now.

41:40.790 --> 41:41.832
Drink with me.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.256
l have to talk about
something kind of serious.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.886
l can't put a girl on Jaguar.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.139
These car guys...

41:58.183 --> 41:59.391
l just can't.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.935
-But, you know...
-lt's not that.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.354
ls this about Joan being made partner?

42:05.190 --> 42:06.231
What?

42:06.649 --> 42:08.150
The circumstances...

42:09.485 --> 42:11.486
She's been with us 1 3 years.

42:23.124 --> 42:25.042
l want you to know that

42:26.377 --> 42:28.587
the day you saw something in me

42:30.506 --> 42:32.090
my whole life changed.

42:33.801 --> 42:37.179
And since then, it's been my privilege

42:38.514 --> 42:43.185
to not only be at your side,
but to be treated like a protégée

42:44.103 --> 42:47.522
and for you to be my mentor
and my champion.

42:52.612 --> 42:53.654
But?

42:54.113 --> 42:55.322
But

42:56.574 --> 42:58.867
l think l've reached a point

42:58.952 --> 43:01.620
where it's time for me
to have a new experience.

43:02.622 --> 43:03.705
Really?

43:04.290 --> 43:05.958
l'm giving my notice.

43:07.168 --> 43:08.794
l've accepted another offer.

43:10.964 --> 43:14.132
-Are you done?
-l'm giving the customary two weeks.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.802
My last day will be the third.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.846
-And don't think...
-Hold on.

43:23.268 --> 43:26.478
lt's been crazy around here
and l know l've been taking you for granted.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.438
And, frankly, l'm impressed.

43:30.483 --> 43:33.485
You finally picked the right moment
to ask for a raise.

43:34.737 --> 43:36.530
lt's time for me to move on.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.490
Come on.

43:39.701 --> 43:40.951
l'm serious.

43:46.833 --> 43:47.916
You're serious?

43:49.002 --> 43:50.168
lt wasn't easy.

43:50.545 --> 43:52.337
l'm sure it wasn't.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.341
Well, good for you. Where are you going?

43:57.760 --> 43:59.177
Cutler Gleason and Chaough.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.392
Perfect.

44:07.979 --> 44:09.229
Okay.

44:11.024 --> 44:13.650
Well, let's pretend l'm not responsible

44:13.735 --> 44:17.487
for every single good thing
that's ever happened to you,

44:17.572 --> 44:20.449
and you tell me the number or make one up

44:21.409 --> 44:22.492
and l'll beat it.

44:23.036 --> 44:24.036
There's no number.

44:24.537 --> 44:25.954
There's no number?

44:26.664 --> 44:28.081
How long do you want to play this out?

44:29.167 --> 44:30.625
l'm sorry,

44:32.545 --> 44:34.588
but you know this is what you would do.

44:39.010 --> 44:41.053
You don't need to wait until the third.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.014
l've got a room full of freelancers out there.

44:44.599 --> 44:45.724
l'll get by.

44:49.312 --> 44:50.645
l understand.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.300
Don't be a stranger.
