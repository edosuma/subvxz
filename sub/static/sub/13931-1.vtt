That's him!

00:30.948 --> 00:31.947
Get his hands!

00:31.982 --> 00:33.815
Get his hands!

00:33.851 --> 00:34.883
Get him!
Hold him still!

00:36.286 --> 00:37.252
What'd you do
with them?!

00:37.287 --> 00:39.087
Where are they?!

00:44.027 --> 00:45.961

00:59.810 --> 01:02.911
[ janet jackson's
"miss you much" plays ]

01:26.937 --> 01:28.803
Gotcha.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.807
Oh, sorry.
Couldn't help myself.

01:32.843 --> 01:33.842
I'm joel.

01:33.877 --> 01:35.844
Amy.
Nice to meet you.

01:35.879 --> 01:36.912
I don't remember you
from camp.

01:36.947 --> 01:38.880
Which years did you go
to stillwater, amy?

01:38.916 --> 01:40.882
Uh, this'll be my first.

01:41.985 --> 01:43.919
Woody allen.

01:43.954 --> 01:46.788
alex!

01:46.823 --> 01:47.956
What's up, man?

01:47.991 --> 01:50.926
Dude, look who
i bumped into at 7-11.

01:50.961 --> 01:52.861
Jason.

01:52.896 --> 01:53.929
Cabin 10 back together,
bro.

01:53.964 --> 01:54.963
It's gonna be sick.

01:54.998 --> 01:58.266
And who might you be?

01:58.302 --> 01:59.868
Oh, uh, amy.
Ahh.

01:59.903 --> 02:02.837
I just love the smell of drakkar
in the morning.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.773
yo, cricket.

02:04.808 --> 02:06.741
I guess they'll hire anyone
at stillwater these days.

02:06.777 --> 02:07.809
Wow, five short years,

02:07.844 --> 02:09.911
And blair's gone from gay
to super gay.

02:09.947 --> 02:12.747
Aww, if you want to kiss me,
just ask.

02:12.783 --> 02:15.884
Have you guys met
our newest addition -- amy?

02:15.919 --> 02:17.786
Hey, yogi bear.

02:17.821 --> 02:18.920
We're going to camp,
not yellowstone.

02:18.956 --> 02:20.922
right. Over dressed.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.857
But yogi bear went
to jellystone,

02:22.893 --> 02:23.858
Not yellowstone.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.760
That's a real place.

02:25.796 --> 02:26.895
Oh!
New girl's got spunk.

02:26.930 --> 02:27.963
I like it.

02:30.968 --> 02:31.933
Cool.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.813
is that jessie tyler?

02:44.848 --> 02:46.815
Some things <i> do</i> improve
with age.

02:47.918 --> 02:48.950
Gang's all here.

02:49.987 --> 02:51.786
Too cute.

02:51.822 --> 02:52.854
Anyone want to help me
with my bag?

02:52.889 --> 02:55.790
Yeah.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.833
Hey, new girl.

03:05.969 --> 03:08.837
You coming?

03:11.842 --> 03:15.744
Here's the key
to first days, amy.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.846
Fit in.
You'll be happier.

03:17.881 --> 03:19.814
You always say that.

03:19.850 --> 03:22.817
I just want you
to succeed this time.

03:22.853 --> 03:25.754
I will.

03:46.910 --> 03:47.909
Wow.
Wow.

03:47.944 --> 03:48.943
Thanks.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.945
It's just like
we remember it!

03:50.981 --> 03:52.881
Whoo!

03:52.916 --> 03:54.883
This is exactly how
i remember it!
We're back!

03:54.918 --> 03:56.918
This is so cool!

03:56.953 --> 03:58.253
Whoa!

03:58.288 --> 03:59.821
This is amazing!

03:59.856 --> 04:01.890
Hey.

04:01.925 --> 04:04.826
Don't worry about a thing,
all right?

04:04.861 --> 04:06.895
I came here every summer
as a kid.

04:06.930 --> 04:09.931
I could give you
the lay of the land.

04:09.966 --> 04:11.866
Hi.

04:11.902 --> 04:14.836
i'm so happy
that you made it.

04:14.871 --> 04:15.870
How was the ride?

04:15.906 --> 04:16.870
Great.

04:16.906 --> 04:19.774
Or walk?

04:19.810 --> 04:20.942
Hey, there.
You must be drew.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.877
I missed the bus.

04:22.913 --> 04:24.746
Okay.

04:24.781 --> 04:26.147
Well, welcome.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.083
And i'm sorry,
you can't smoke here.

04:30.087 --> 04:31.119
Thank you.

04:31.154 --> 04:34.856
I'm deborah carpenter.
I'm the new camp director.

04:34.891 --> 04:36.925
I know that most of you here
were campers,

04:36.960 --> 04:39.861
Uh, before it closed down
in '84,

04:39.896 --> 04:42.197
Which gives us
something in common.

04:42.232 --> 04:46.167
But, um, this place,
it, um, well...

04:48.138 --> 04:49.170
...It stuck with me,

04:49.206 --> 04:52.974
Which is why i've sunk
everything that i have

04:53.009 --> 04:54.876
Into reopening it.

04:54.911 --> 04:58.780
I want to make stillwater
as special for everyone else

04:58.815 --> 05:01.149
As it was for me.

05:01.184 --> 05:02.784
You can find out
who you are here.

05:02.819 --> 05:07.922
You can -- you can be
who you want to be here.

05:09.126 --> 05:10.925
This will be
the best summer that --

05:14.030 --> 05:15.797
What was that?

05:15.832 --> 05:17.766
Oh, no.

05:20.771 --> 05:21.770
Poor thing.

05:21.805 --> 05:23.171
The hell you doing?

05:23.206 --> 05:24.205
That was my trap.

05:25.776 --> 05:27.175
These are my grounds.

05:27.210 --> 05:29.144
Stay the hell
out of my way.

05:29.179 --> 05:31.079
Whoa.
Dave's still alive.

05:31.114 --> 05:32.947
And still the gardener.

05:32.983 --> 05:35.850
He's very serious
about his job.

05:35.886 --> 05:36.885
You mean drunk.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.919
He's like a walking bottle
of chivas.

05:37.954 --> 05:39.821
That thing better not
wind up in my clothes.

05:39.856 --> 05:40.789
Okay.

05:40.824 --> 05:42.157
Three short days

05:42.192 --> 05:44.092
Till we open the gates
and the campers arrive,

05:44.127 --> 05:45.126
So get settled in.

05:45.162 --> 05:47.061
We have
a lot of work to do.

05:50.133 --> 05:51.933
Half of you
are getting a slip of paper.

05:51.968 --> 05:53.835
On that slip is a name.

05:53.870 --> 05:55.904
That will be your lab partner
for the rest of the semester.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.741
Starting a new school
in the middle of senior year.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.109
That's some bad luck.

06:01.144 --> 06:04.112
My family...

06:04.147 --> 06:06.080
Our situation changed.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.984
Well, hunter high's
a lot like vietnam.

06:10.020 --> 06:12.821
You just got
to get out alive.

06:12.856 --> 06:14.856
Now please go,
introduce yourselves.

06:14.925 --> 06:17.792
Oh, boy.
Margot tate.

06:17.828 --> 06:19.127
Tough break.

06:22.065 --> 06:24.032
Maybe we can be friends.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.066
Aim lower.

06:28.939 --> 06:31.940
So, uh, i got you.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.743
Um, let's switch.

06:35.779 --> 06:38.213
I got some girl whose name
i don't even want to know.

06:38.248 --> 06:40.181
Kind of like you.

06:40.217 --> 06:42.050
No switching.

06:42.085 --> 06:43.952
No switching.

06:45.088 --> 06:46.921
See you later, new girl.

06:46.957 --> 06:48.957
Love those
ill-fitting jordaches,

06:48.992 --> 06:51.759
By the way.

06:55.198 --> 06:57.765
So, uh, these experiments
look pretty basic.

06:57.801 --> 06:59.167
We just need
some good ol' h2o.

07:01.004 --> 07:01.970
That's water.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.872
I know what water is.

07:09.846 --> 07:10.812
oh!

07:26.796 --> 07:29.864
wow, good one.

07:33.136 --> 07:35.103
Hey, how's it going,
l.L. Bean?

07:35.138 --> 07:37.005
You find your way back
from jellystone?

07:37.040 --> 07:38.006
How was old faithful?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.107
stop.

07:39.142 --> 07:41.876
Here you go.

07:41.912 --> 07:42.977
Thanks.

07:44.948 --> 07:45.847
Hey, drew.

07:48.852 --> 07:51.152
No one knows
anything about him.

07:51.187 --> 07:53.221
I mean, maybe he was a camper
we just don't remember.

07:53.256 --> 07:55.123
I think we'd remember.

07:55.158 --> 07:57.125
Well,
here's hoping he's gay.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.861
He's definitely gay.
Really?

07:59.896 --> 08:00.895
He hasn't hit on me.

08:01.965 --> 08:03.798
Cricket.

08:03.833 --> 08:05.800
Cricket!

08:05.835 --> 08:07.802
You guys ever hear
of adolfo constanzo?

08:07.837 --> 08:09.771
Doesn't he play first base
for the mets?

08:09.806 --> 08:11.105
He's a serial killer.

08:11.141 --> 08:13.007
He just killed
two dozen people, so...

08:13.043 --> 08:14.142
It says here
that he murdered his victims

08:14.177 --> 08:17.011
In a satanic,
ritualistic fashion.

08:17.047 --> 08:18.913
Hmm.

08:18.949 --> 08:21.749
My mom thinks that there
are satanists living
on our block back home.

08:21.785 --> 08:22.984
You've been watching
too much "geraldo."

08:23.019 --> 08:24.719
i didn't say
that <i> i</i> believed it.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.155
You guys want to hear
something really scary?

08:27.190 --> 08:29.057
Oh, do tell.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.091
Okay, well,
look where we are.

08:30.126 --> 08:31.125
We're in the middle
of the woods --

08:31.161 --> 08:33.962
No phones, no cars,
no weapons.

08:33.996 --> 08:35.996
No locks
on the cabin doors.

08:36.032 --> 08:37.966
Anyone could come in
through the forest

08:38.001 --> 08:39.801
Or on the lake.

08:39.836 --> 08:41.736
Through that one little gate
on the main road,

08:41.770 --> 08:43.171
Someone could just
stroll in

08:43.206 --> 08:47.008
And kill
each and every one of us.

08:47.043 --> 08:49.944
They wouldn't find the bodies
for days.

08:56.853 --> 08:58.786
Dude,
i totally got her.

08:58.822 --> 09:00.121
Yeah, you got me.

09:00.156 --> 09:02.023
All right, granola bar.

09:02.058 --> 09:03.992
Now shoo.

09:04.027 --> 09:04.959
Come on.

09:04.995 --> 09:06.027
all right.

09:06.062 --> 09:07.862
You all right?
Yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.834
Well,
fire's dying down.

09:12.869 --> 09:16.170
Should we get more wood,
or are we calling it a night?

09:16.206 --> 09:18.072
No.

09:18.108 --> 09:19.107
We're just
getting started.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.009
So, you going?

09:21.044 --> 09:21.976
Not it.

09:22.012 --> 09:23.911
Not it!

09:23.947 --> 09:25.013
Looks like
it's new girl.

09:25.048 --> 09:27.782
Go get 'em, jellystone.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.751
Hey, boo-boo.
Come on, you can do it.

09:29.786 --> 09:30.785
Take one for the team.

10:07.090 --> 10:09.123
You don't belong here.

10:09.159 --> 10:10.992
Leave now.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.928
The longer you stay,
the worse it'll be.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.509
Wake up, boys!

10:40.915 --> 10:41.848
Man.

10:43.718 --> 10:45.685
Maybe you should start
with a squirt gun.

10:46.788 --> 10:48.655
We're not the first guys

10:48.690 --> 10:52.458
That our, uh, chirpy little
friend woke up in this cabin.

10:53.495 --> 10:55.428
Look what i found.

10:57.899 --> 11:00.833
"cricket lets you stick it
in her hand."

11:00.869 --> 11:02.702
Ew.

11:02.737 --> 11:03.803
This was
mark hordon's bunk.

11:05.674 --> 11:08.675
You gave hard-on a handy?
You were like 13.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.643
I know.
I was so innocent then.

11:10.679 --> 11:12.545
Mm.

11:12.580 --> 11:14.480
<i> Good morning, counselors.</i>

11:14.516 --> 11:17.450
<i>Two days till campers arrive,</i>
<i>and we have work to do.</i>

11:17.485 --> 11:19.819
<i>Let's go out there</i>
<i>and make it a great day.</i>

11:19.854 --> 11:21.688
okay,
let's go.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.449
So, jess, how's college?

11:49.484 --> 11:50.550
Mm, it's all right.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.519
I see you and blair are
still attached at the hip.

11:53.555 --> 11:54.887
Yeah.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.789
Some things
never change.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.660
Unlike you.

12:00.695 --> 12:01.728
Or you.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.530
I guess we, uh,
kind of dropped the ball

12:04.566 --> 12:05.598
On keeping in touch,
huh?

12:07.569 --> 12:09.502
It happens.

12:09.537 --> 12:11.571
You guys got it from here,
right?

12:11.606 --> 12:13.473
Yeah.

12:13.508 --> 12:16.843
Were you two
friends at camp?

12:16.878 --> 12:17.844
Best friends.

12:47.609 --> 12:49.475
It's probably a hunter.

12:49.511 --> 12:51.444
Wandered too far
onto our property.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.846
What kind of a hunter
guts a deer

12:53.882 --> 12:55.848
And leaves
the carcass behind?

12:55.884 --> 12:57.850
Let's not
get carried away.

12:57.886 --> 12:58.851
I'll have dave
clean it up.

12:58.887 --> 12:59.819
It's nothing
to worry about.

12:59.854 --> 13:02.622
No, no.
This <i> was</i> dave.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.657
There's something wrong
with that guy.

13:04.692 --> 13:06.626
Last night,
he threatened me.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.398
He -- he said
i had to leave.

13:12.433 --> 13:14.400
He was scary.
Okay.

13:14.435 --> 13:17.737
I know that dave can be
a little off kilter,

13:17.772 --> 13:18.805
But he's harmless.
Is he?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.673
You saw how he was
with that mouse.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.542
Ted bundy.

13:22.577 --> 13:24.510
Started with animals.

13:24.546 --> 13:26.546
okay, everyone.
It'll be fine.

13:26.581 --> 13:28.447
We have a lot
of work to do still.

13:28.483 --> 13:29.415
Let's go.

13:29.450 --> 13:30.483
Thank you.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.851
Let's go.

13:31.886 --> 13:33.753
Amy, i gave you
the ropes course.

13:33.788 --> 13:35.721
The knots can be tricky.
Need some help?

13:35.757 --> 13:36.823
I could partner you up
with jessie.

13:36.858 --> 13:40.660
That's okay.
I'll figure it out.

13:51.906 --> 13:55.741
So, margot, i thought we could
talk about our lab work.

13:55.777 --> 13:56.776
Maybe we should
make a plan.

13:59.681 --> 14:00.646
Sure.

14:00.682 --> 14:02.582
Great.

14:02.617 --> 14:05.518
So, amy.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.386
Sorry if i came off
a little harsh before.

14:07.422 --> 14:09.355
That's okay.
You want a chip?

14:09.390 --> 14:11.457
not unless it comes
with a tongue depressor.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.794
Hey, look, we're about to have
a big end-of-the-year kegger.

14:14.829 --> 14:15.761
Want to come?

14:15.797 --> 14:17.763
Yeah, cool.

14:17.799 --> 14:20.600
Great.
Just one thing first.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.504
Go give this
to your friend over there.

14:33.781 --> 14:35.581
Are you kidding?

14:35.617 --> 14:36.716
Come on,
it'll be so funny.

14:53.801 --> 14:55.801
Hey.

14:55.837 --> 14:57.770
So, yeah, maybe we should
get together after school

14:57.805 --> 14:59.705
And figure out
some of that lab stuff.

14:59.741 --> 15:01.540
What do you think?

15:13.388 --> 15:17.590
Is this as hard for you
as it is for me?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.659
They've been friends
since they were kids.

15:19.694 --> 15:22.561
How do...

15:22.597 --> 15:24.363
New girl.

15:24.399 --> 15:25.431
You're just in time.

15:28.403 --> 15:29.402
We're going swimming.

15:29.437 --> 15:31.370
Oh, what you got there?
Hey.

15:31.406 --> 15:32.705
Cool, thanks.
Hey!

15:32.740 --> 15:34.640
I hate you.

15:34.676 --> 15:36.609
Yeah, every counselor's got
to go in the lake.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.544
Stillwater tradition.

15:38.579 --> 15:39.545
There's a...

15:40.648 --> 15:45.418
...Legend
about lake stillwater.

15:46.821 --> 15:50.790
They say,
if you stare long enough,

15:50.825 --> 15:55.561
The water will stare
right back...

15:55.596 --> 15:56.595
At you.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.533
Now, who's coming in?

16:00.601 --> 16:02.501
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Let's go!

16:02.537 --> 16:05.404
Come on, man.
Whoo!

16:15.583 --> 16:16.515
Go!

16:23.825 --> 16:25.725
Ah, new girl's going in.

16:25.760 --> 16:26.826
I got to get this
on camera.

16:28.663 --> 16:30.663
You and that camera,
joel.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.598
Do you ever
put that thing down?

16:40.475 --> 16:41.440
Get in here!

16:41.476 --> 16:44.777
Come on.
Get in here.

16:44.812 --> 16:45.745
Aah!

17:10.780 --> 17:13.513
Hello, deputy.

17:13.549 --> 17:14.949
Y'all can relax.

17:14.983 --> 17:17.550
It's most likely
just a -- a terrible accident.

17:17.587 --> 17:18.886
We still need
to investigate.

17:18.922 --> 17:19.954
Animal control told me

17:19.989 --> 17:23.691
There was a dead deer
found here yesterday gutted.

17:23.726 --> 17:24.791
Its heart
was ripped out.

17:24.827 --> 17:27.560
Excuse us, folks.

17:29.632 --> 17:30.598
All i'm saying is,

17:30.633 --> 17:31.999
An animal gets slaughtered
like that...

17:32.035 --> 17:34.802
Slow down, junior.
...And then
dave washes up dead?

17:34.837 --> 17:36.737
All due respect, but shouldn't
we figure out what's --

17:36.773 --> 17:39.674
What we should do
is not scare these kids.

17:39.709 --> 17:40.808
I know you want
to make your mark,

17:40.843 --> 17:42.677
But this isn't the way.

17:42.712 --> 17:44.545
I'd let him
handcuff me anytime.

17:44.580 --> 17:47.581
<i>That's</i> your type now?
He's a townie.

17:47.617 --> 17:49.917
Guys.
Someone is dead.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.754
Uh, ms. Carpenter,

17:53.790 --> 17:54.789
I spoke
with the m.E. Team.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.691
They're prepping the body
for an autopsy,

17:56.726 --> 17:58.626
And that should
wrap us up.

17:58.661 --> 17:59.694
Everything's
gonna be fine.

17:59.729 --> 18:00.962
Thank you both.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.499
All right, everybody.

18:05.535 --> 18:06.934
Let's go to bed.

18:09.772 --> 18:11.806
Evening, deputy.

18:11.841 --> 18:12.807
Evening.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.642
Hey, junior.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.903
Where are you going,
newbie?

18:42.939 --> 18:43.904
To get water.

18:43.940 --> 18:45.840
Well,
don't get ax-murdered.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.778
Hey.

18:55.718 --> 18:56.684
Thanks.

19:13.669 --> 19:15.569
oh, you scared
the hell out of me.

19:15.605 --> 19:16.670
Sorry about that.

19:16.706 --> 19:19.607
I'm just back to check out
the gardener's cabin.

19:19.642 --> 19:21.876
What happened
to your uniform?

19:21.911 --> 19:22.977
I'm off duty.

19:23.012 --> 19:24.779
What are <i> you</i> doing
out here?

19:24.814 --> 19:26.781
Getting water.

19:26.816 --> 19:28.649
I couldn't sleep.

19:28.684 --> 19:30.551
Right.
You're the one that found him.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.989
Come on, i'll walk you back.
It's on my way.

19:35.024 --> 19:37.958
Hold on,
i-i came from there.

19:37.994 --> 19:39.527
Oh,
you're new here, huh?

19:39.562 --> 19:41.762
Every camper knows
the shortcuts.

19:41.798 --> 19:42.763
Trust me, it's this way.

19:44.834 --> 19:48.736
Wait, you went here?

19:48.771 --> 19:50.571
I thought you were --
a townie?

19:51.641 --> 19:52.606
It's all right.

19:52.642 --> 19:53.607
Yeah, i'm a townie.

19:53.643 --> 19:55.009
But my dad
was the sheriff,

19:55.044 --> 19:57.011
And a perk of the job was
free summers at stillwater.

20:00.883 --> 20:02.817
It's just the wind.

20:02.852 --> 20:04.752
Some of these trees
are old...

20:05.855 --> 20:08.622
...And dead.

20:08.658 --> 20:10.658
Really selling me
on this place.

20:10.693 --> 20:12.660
Oh, it's great.

20:12.695 --> 20:14.962
Really.
I love this camp.

20:14.997 --> 20:16.030
Hell...

20:16.065 --> 20:17.932
...All my firsts
were here.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.836
First girlfriend, first kiss,
first everything.

20:21.871 --> 20:22.937
<i>Everything?</i>

20:22.972 --> 20:24.805
Well, not everything.
We were kids.

20:24.841 --> 20:29.610
So first friendship bracelet
and first nicknames.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.611
I was townie.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.612
How original.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.646
And she was braces.

20:32.682 --> 20:33.614
braces?

20:33.649 --> 20:35.616
Let me guess.
Yeah.

20:35.651 --> 20:40.020
That one summer was...

20:40.056 --> 20:41.856
Pretty great.

20:41.891 --> 20:44.859
If it was so great,
why only one summer?

20:44.894 --> 20:48.729
Well, my dad was killed
in the line of duty in '82.

20:48.764 --> 20:50.631
I'm sorry.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.067
And, well, they only
gave free summers to
the sheriff's kid,

20:53.102 --> 20:54.068
Not the waitress
at the diner,

20:54.103 --> 20:55.903
So i went back
to being a townie.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.739
Come on.

21:14.991 --> 21:17.791
All right.
This is dave's cabin.

21:17.827 --> 21:19.693
I've got it from here,
amy.

21:19.729 --> 21:20.728
No.

21:20.763 --> 21:23.731
I want to know
what happened to him.

21:26.068 --> 21:28.636
Just stay close, okay?

21:40.750 --> 21:41.815
There's nothing
in here.

21:41.851 --> 21:44.585
Not out in the open.

22:09.011 --> 22:10.911
What the hell?

22:26.028 --> 22:27.628
What was dave into?

22:33.069 --> 22:34.001
Amy.

22:34.036 --> 22:35.836
Deputy?
Get out!

22:35.871 --> 22:36.837
get out!

23:04.634 --> 23:06.000
Come on!

23:27.281 --> 23:29.081
Deputy.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.482
Thought
you were off duty.

23:30.518 --> 23:31.517
Yeah, well...

23:31.552 --> 23:33.452
Any theories
on what caused it?

23:33.487 --> 23:34.486
It was electrical.

23:34.522 --> 23:36.455
These cabins
have wiring from the '20s.

23:36.490 --> 23:38.290
And yet
the maintenance man

23:38.325 --> 23:40.325
Didn't notice that
in his own home?

23:40.361 --> 23:43.162
Uh, something
you want to say to me?

23:43.197 --> 23:44.530
I don't think
this was an accident.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.100
Dave had this
in his cabin.

23:51.438 --> 23:52.437
It's an old map
of the lake.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.275
Only,
the person who drew it,

23:56.310 --> 23:58.143
They saw something else
in this place.

23:58.179 --> 23:59.211
I mean, look at it.

23:59.246 --> 24:02.181
It looks like
some kind of beast.

24:02.216 --> 24:07.085
Right there, in the heart of it,
that's the camp.

24:07.121 --> 24:09.388
Someone didn't want us
to find this.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.073
Who would want
to murder him?

24:28.108 --> 24:30.409
Suicide.
<i>Definitely</i> suicide.

24:30.444 --> 24:32.344
No. Why would
dave kill himself?

24:32.379 --> 24:35.380
Hmm. He was a janitor
at a summer camp.

24:35.416 --> 24:37.282
Nah, that's ignorant.

24:37.318 --> 24:39.184
True.
Yep.

24:39.220 --> 24:42.087
What are you
looking for, anyway?

24:42.122 --> 24:43.522
Nothing.
Never mind.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.526
Dave had these pictures
in his cabin

24:47.561 --> 24:50.429
Of dead people.

24:50.464 --> 24:52.264
They were old.

24:52.299 --> 24:53.365
Really old.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.234
Like tin types?

24:55.269 --> 24:56.268
What was that, hair?

24:56.303 --> 24:58.170
Death portraits
from the victorian era.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.105
Oh, man, that's creepy.

25:00.140 --> 25:01.406
And you know this <i> why?</i>

25:04.345 --> 25:06.311
Are we really not
gonna open camp over this?

25:06.347 --> 25:07.279
Would you rather
the campers end up

25:07.314 --> 25:10.148
Like dave or the deer?

25:10.184 --> 25:12.251
You know, not everything's
a movie, all right?

25:12.286 --> 25:14.152
This isn't
"rosemary's baby."

25:14.188 --> 25:15.120
No, it's more like
"the wicker man."

25:16.457 --> 25:19.358
British thriller, 1973.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.426
Cop goes to an island
to investigate a missing girl.

25:23.430 --> 25:25.297
Only that's all
just a con.

25:25.332 --> 25:27.232
Cop realizes that the islanders
are actually cultists

25:27.268 --> 25:28.300
Who want to use him
as a human sacrifice

25:28.335 --> 25:30.202
For some kind of ritual.

25:32.172 --> 25:33.505
What happens in the end?

25:33.540 --> 25:35.073
Well, they put him

25:35.109 --> 25:38.443
In this gigantic wooden
statue -- a wicker man --

25:38.479 --> 25:40.379
Burn him alive.

25:42.483 --> 25:44.216
What the hell's
wrong with you, man?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.250
Well, she asked.

25:45.286 --> 25:49.054
Yeah, she was also
just <i> in</i> a fire.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.089
I want to know what she was
doing alone in the cabin

25:51.125 --> 25:52.524
With the deputy.

25:52.559 --> 25:53.525
What is that
supposed to mean?

25:53.560 --> 25:54.526
You tell me.

25:54.561 --> 25:56.428
Hey, hey,
chill out, you guys.

25:59.366 --> 26:02.167
Hello?

26:02.202 --> 26:03.268
Jessie.

26:03.304 --> 26:05.137
It's your mom.

26:05.172 --> 26:08.006
Way too baked.

26:08.042 --> 26:09.007
Tell her
you can't find me.

26:11.045 --> 26:12.010
Oh.
Aw.

26:12.046 --> 26:14.012
seriously?

26:14.048 --> 26:15.447
Anyone got a flashlight?
No.

26:15.482 --> 26:17.316
Someone's gonna have to go
flip the breakers.

26:17.351 --> 26:18.317
Not it!
Not it!

26:20.354 --> 26:23.322
Guess i am...Again.

26:23.357 --> 26:25.157
You guessed right.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.059
Why don't you
go with her, alex?

26:27.094 --> 26:28.493
Make sure
she doesn't get lost.

26:28.529 --> 26:30.095
why should
new girl have to go?

26:30.130 --> 26:31.129
Give me the flashlight.

26:31.165 --> 26:33.365
Has to be her.
Camp tradition.

26:34.468 --> 26:37.336
Well...Tradition calls,
right?

26:44.244 --> 26:45.210
Here we go.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.147
Watch your head.

26:53.454 --> 26:57.322
All right,
should be...Right there.

26:58.425 --> 27:00.325
Um, hold the flashlight.

27:00.361 --> 27:02.227
I can do it.

27:02.262 --> 27:04.096
I am "it," right?

27:10.504 --> 27:12.070
Oh, man.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.007
Lucky you have me here

27:15.042 --> 27:17.275
To protect you
from the beasts of the wild.

27:24.251 --> 27:25.217
Mm.

27:34.395 --> 27:38.263
If you don't want to,
it's fine.

27:44.238 --> 27:46.204
Camp stillwater?

27:46.240 --> 27:49.041
It's reopening for
the first time in five years.

27:50.177 --> 27:52.044
"be who you want to be."

27:52.079 --> 27:53.478
It's what
we've been looking for.

27:55.449 --> 27:58.283
What do you even do
at camp?

27:58.318 --> 28:01.219
Build fires, swim in the lake,
kiss some boys.

28:01.255 --> 28:02.254
We can do whatever we want.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.156
Margot.

28:04.191 --> 28:06.124
You're supposed
to be studying.

28:09.063 --> 28:11.463
Are your parents in favor
of this camp idea?

28:17.037 --> 28:18.437
Of course not.

28:20.441 --> 28:22.307
I'll think about it.

28:22.342 --> 28:25.277
It's just
all...A little scary.

28:25.312 --> 28:29.147
That's exactly why
we should be doing this.

28:29.183 --> 28:32.451
Sometimes you got to do things
that scare you, right?

29:00.481 --> 29:02.347
What is it?

29:02.382 --> 29:04.249
It's okay.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.118
It's okay.
Come here.

29:12.192 --> 29:13.158
Are you okay?

29:13.193 --> 29:15.026
no.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.617
Something i can help you with,
deputy?

29:30.652 --> 29:31.651
Just having a look around,

29:31.687 --> 29:33.553
Making sure
i didn't miss anything.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.858
What exactly
are you looking for?

29:37.893 --> 29:39.826
not entirely sure.

29:39.862 --> 29:40.894
Just a feeling
that i have.

29:40.929 --> 29:43.730
And this feeling is worth

29:43.765 --> 29:45.732
Creating a panic
with my counselors?

29:45.767 --> 29:47.634
All due respect,
ms. Carpenter,

29:47.669 --> 29:50.670
I'd rather speak up and be wrong
than say nothing and be right.

29:58.847 --> 30:00.747
So, what happened to amy
last night?

30:00.782 --> 30:01.781
Why'd she just run off?

30:01.817 --> 30:02.782
I don't know.

30:02.818 --> 30:05.719
She, uh --
she got freaked out.

30:05.754 --> 30:07.621
If i was alone with you,
i'd run home, too.

30:10.692 --> 30:11.992
Burn, dude.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.560
Did something happen?

30:13.595 --> 30:14.594
No.

30:14.630 --> 30:15.896
Now she's skipping breakfast.

30:15.931 --> 30:19.866
Bet you she's on a bus home.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.714
I got to say,
you look pretty hot.

30:36.685 --> 30:38.952
Where did you get this?

30:38.987 --> 30:39.986
Spencer's.

30:40.022 --> 30:41.955
Hey, what did you decide
about camp?

30:41.990 --> 30:43.890
You got to get
your application in.

30:43.959 --> 30:44.958
Margot, dinner's ready.

30:44.993 --> 30:46.760
are you guys...

30:48.897 --> 30:50.730
What's going on in here?

30:51.867 --> 30:53.667
It's just a party, mom.

30:53.702 --> 30:54.701
And if it were
to get broken up?

30:54.736 --> 30:55.735
If you were
to get caught drinking?

30:55.771 --> 30:57.637
That's it.

30:57.673 --> 30:59.506
Madison revokes
your admission.
Why do you always do this?!

30:59.541 --> 31:00.907
And for the next four years,
you'll be sleeping here,

31:00.943 --> 31:02.943
Because i doubt anyone's gonna
hire you without a degree!

31:02.978 --> 31:04.911
Is it really worth
jeopardizing your future?

31:04.947 --> 31:06.780
How about
i choose my future?

31:06.815 --> 31:09.749
If you don't listen to me,
you won't have one.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.524
I'm going.

31:19.595 --> 31:21.928
I just decided
i'm going to camp with you.

31:21.964 --> 31:24.931
Really?
Why?

31:24.967 --> 31:29.869
For the same reason
we're sneaking out
to that party tonight.

31:29.905 --> 31:34.608
Sometimes you have to do things
that scare you, right?

Whoa, whoa, take it easy.

32:21.556 --> 32:22.555
I'm sorry!

32:22.591 --> 32:23.923
Sorry for what?
Talk to me.

32:23.959 --> 32:25.825
I'm sorry.

34:05.794 --> 34:06.926
This can't be happening!
Margot, calm down.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.728
Don't tell me to calm down!
They're arresting people!

34:09.764 --> 34:10.730
How many drinks
did you have?

34:10.766 --> 34:12.665
My mom -- she was right.

that's it.
