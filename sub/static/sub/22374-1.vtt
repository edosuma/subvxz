<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b>.</font>

01:09.836 --> 01:14.640
<i>You look like a man that's being
eaten from the inside out.</i>

01:20.146 --> 01:21.213
What are you doing here?

01:22.582 --> 01:24.716
<i>Oh I think you
know... Leo.</i>

01:30.857 --> 01:38.857
You've wasted the fucking trip. The
tumour's going to do the job for you.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.837
Oh I don't know about that.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.576
<i>There's still things we can do.</i>

02:12.665 --> 02:14.133
<i>Donal!</i>

02:15.368 --> 02:17.436
<i>Donal! Help me!</i>

02:32.652 --> 02:34.386
You allright?
You allright?

02:34.787 --> 02:35.787
I fell.

02:42.929 --> 02:43.929
Before or after?

02:45.298 --> 02:46.298
Before.

03:15.828 --> 03:18.630
I'm only after washing
those floors.

04:36.376 --> 04:37.376
Thank you.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.884
You get what you're owed.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.820
Don't you worry about that.

04:55.728 --> 04:58.297
So, I can't square
you altogether.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.401
Hang on, hang on.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.804
I brought you something instead.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.911
She barely made it over the
road.

05:13.346 --> 05:16.107
But a man like you could fix her up
and sell her on for a good profit.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.526
Or you could always
hang on to it

05:30.563 --> 05:32.798
ask that Liz one to go
on a bit of a holiday.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.370
I couldn't leave
my ma on her own.

05:40.807 --> 05:45.077
You're too loyal Donal. Get out
and enjoy yourself.

05:45.745 --> 05:48.013
The couch turns into a bed.

05:51.884 --> 05:56.855
So... what do you think?
With this, plus two hundred?

06:06.132 --> 06:08.800
Poor old Tommy Rafferty's gone.

06:09.469 --> 06:10.469
Is he?

06:15.942 --> 06:18.110
There's a wake we'll
need to be at.

06:18.745 --> 06:19.745
Aye.

06:23.850 --> 06:28.720
I might give his wife a call and see if
she needs a hand with the sandwiches.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.956
They'd be lucky to have yours.

06:43.936 --> 06:46.738
Jesus, I didn't realise you were
that fond of Tommy Rafferty.

06:49.709 --> 06:55.013
I'm not... it's just, everybody
I know is fucking dying.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.549
I can stay in tonight
if you want

06:57.817 --> 07:02.587
don't be silly. I'll
press your shirt.

07:06.793 --> 07:10.128
McMahon Leo, 1945 - 2016. Died
this week at the city hospital...

07:23.643 --> 07:24.810
Same again?

07:25.645 --> 07:30.081
No. Um, an old gin and tonic.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.483
Living dangerously.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.485
You know me.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.020
How's your ma?

07:35.721 --> 07:36.721
Best.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.157
You should bring her
down some night.

07:39.159 --> 07:44.563
She's at the stage now y'know, she
doesn't like to leave the house anymore.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.771
You ever get a chance to head
out for a night yourself?

07:56.108 --> 07:57.709
Sorry Donal. Give me a sec'.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.014
<i>Lads, less of the shite.</i>

08:03.016 --> 08:04.616
It was an accident, Liz.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.789
My wee darling, eh?

08:12.692 --> 08:15.627
Alright men, give her
room to dry it up.

08:15.629 --> 08:19.564
Get your fucking hand off
me. Fucking silverback.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.868
What the fuck you gonna do?
What? You gonna tell your ma?

08:23.135 --> 08:28.273
I mean how the fuck is it a man your
age can still live with his ma?

08:28.275 --> 08:29.274
What the fuck is that about?

08:29.276 --> 08:33.245
Wee boys like you shouldn't take
drink if they can't hold it.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.145
Don't fucking look at
me like that again!

08:35.148 --> 08:38.216
One, two, out to
fuck, young man.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.932
Where did you get this?

10:01.233 --> 10:05.704
Bernard. Some job isn't she?

10:06.672 --> 10:07.672
Come on in.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.246
Will we go for an old spin?

10:16.182 --> 10:18.917
I'm too old for
that carry on now.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.392
What was the name of that beach where
you and da used to have the caravan at?

10:22.888 --> 10:23.888
Montague.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.057
Sure we'll go there.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.194
I don't think so, Donal.

10:29.695 --> 10:32.897
Aw, come on. I'll put big tom on
the speakers. It'll be good Craic.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.734
Donal!! Would you just
fucking leave it!!

10:37.169 --> 10:40.338
And you shouldn't be spending
so much time on these machines.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.074
There's a pile of work
to be done around here.

10:57.356 --> 10:58.356
Well.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.692
I brought you these.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.294
Thank you.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.398
If you want to take a spin away down the
country by yourself, I'll not mind.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.700
I'll be grand on my own.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.336
No, I'm alright.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.739
The wee beach was beautiful.

11:17.443 --> 11:25.350
Well whatever you do, leave the door
open a bit... I like that old tune.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.008
Ma?

12:27.813 --> 12:30.048
Donal help!

12:55.508 --> 12:56.508
Ma!

12:57.977 --> 13:05.977
Ma? Ma? Ma...

13:12.391 --> 13:17.896
Hello, I need help -

13:21.000 --> 13:26.037
I know this is hard but it's important we
get the information while it's still fresh.

13:30.242 --> 13:38.242
I saw a man leaving the house. Clean shaven,
light hair. Fancy looking sort of boy.

13:40.554 --> 13:41.986
You were outside?

13:43.322 --> 13:45.023
I was sleeping in the shed.

13:47.026 --> 13:54.432
I heard noises. I went to look and
saw two men leaving the house.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.934
And you're sure about that?

13:57.837 --> 14:02.440
Didn't I tell you, clean
shaven, light hair...

14:02.908 --> 14:05.276
'Fancy looking sort
of a boy, ' yeah.

14:06.078 --> 14:09.981
And what about the man inside the car?
Did you get a look at him?

14:11.217 --> 14:13.218
<i>Sir, we're not
finished here yet.</i>

14:13.220 --> 14:15.620
<i>Give him a minute.
Fucking hell.</i>

14:38.644 --> 14:43.248
She'd go clean mad if she knew
her wake was closed coffin.

14:45.017 --> 14:45.984
She would not.

14:45.986 --> 14:49.520
Oh, you wanna seen
when she was younger.

14:50.122 --> 14:54.025
Couldn't leave the house without
the old paint scraper makeup.

14:55.594 --> 14:56.594
That's a sin.

14:57.429 --> 15:02.133
Sorry, cub. Aye, she
was a good sister.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.571
Good mother. She was
lucky to have you.

15:16.015 --> 15:19.651
Sorry for your trouble,
Donal. Wild altogether.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.453
Aye. Thanks, Marcus.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.429
Sorry for your loss, eh?

15:32.298 --> 15:33.298
Thank you.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.511
Me, Joe and the
kids Belfast 1975

18:17.296 --> 18:20.098
hey boy, what's going on here?

18:22.501 --> 18:25.803
<i>Put that shotgun down.</i>

18:28.474 --> 18:33.377
<i>I said put that shotgun down.</i>

18:36.281 --> 18:38.182
What's this carry on boys?

18:38.184 --> 18:39.817
<i>Now step forward and fuck up.</i>

18:42.454 --> 18:44.222
<i>Up.</i>

19:05.844 --> 19:07.145
<i>Holy fuck!</i>

19:07.346 --> 19:08.913
How much slack
did you give that thing

19:08.915 --> 19:11.182
take it up another two foot.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.153
<i>You, stand over there.</i>

19:22.761 --> 19:23.794
<i>More than that.</i>

19:49.621 --> 19:51.189
<i>What did you do?</i>

19:56.295 --> 19:57.662
What are you doing here?

20:03.602 --> 20:05.403
They're checking in.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.271
Who is?

20:07.973 --> 20:09.440
I'll ask them direct.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.442
Alright!

20:10.609 --> 20:11.943
We were sent to kill you...

20:12.311 --> 20:14.312
Well you went at it in a
bit of a roundabout way.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.614
They wanted it to look
like you did it yourself.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.583
Why?

20:18.585 --> 20:21.452
He had all the information.
They don't tell me anything.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.469
This is so bad... this
is so fucking bad...

20:57.623 --> 21:01.559
<i>Emergency. Which service do you require?
Police, fire or ambulance?</i>

21:03.629 --> 21:04.629
<i>Hello?</i>

21:06.298 --> 21:07.298
<i>Hello?</i>

21:20.979 --> 21:22.947
Tell them everything went grand.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.416
If you don't talk to them,
I will.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.453
<i>Damien?!</i>

21:29.554 --> 21:31.956
No. It's Bartosz here.

21:32.524 --> 21:35.393
<i>Put Dee, put Dee on
the fucking phone!</i>

21:37.496 --> 21:39.530
He is taking a shit.

21:39.665 --> 21:40.665
<i>Did youse get it done?</i>

21:40.799 --> 21:42.667
Yes yes.

21:42.901 --> 21:44.969
<i>Right. The cockle
bar. Twelve tomorrow.</i>

21:44.971 --> 21:46.337
Can I see her then?

21:46.339 --> 21:48.005
<i>Aye, yeah. Surely. Aye.</i>

21:59.951 --> 22:01.085
Now what?

22:04.089 --> 22:08.326
Hey! Now what?

23:23.602 --> 23:28.839
Makes no difference who you
are, ghetto Joe or superstar

24:28.867 --> 24:30.167
now get chatting.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.702
About what?

24:31.704 --> 24:34.872
Start off easy.
What's your name?

24:34.874 --> 24:35.874
Bartosz.

24:36.541 --> 24:37.541
And where you from?

24:38.043 --> 24:39.043
Bydgoszcz.

24:40.178 --> 24:42.079
Poland.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.515
That other boy on the blower,
is he Polish as well?

24:44.517 --> 24:45.517
His name's Gavigan.

24:45.684 --> 24:47.218
What's he look like?

24:47.220 --> 24:50.187
I don't know. Regular. I
don't have a picture.

24:50.555 --> 24:51.675
Fancy looking sort of a boy?

24:52.891 --> 24:53.891
How fancy?

24:55.093 --> 24:56.760
Why did he kill Florence?

24:57.028 --> 24:58.729
Who?

24:58.731 --> 25:02.733
My ma. Do you not know
what happened her?

25:05.237 --> 25:11.242
Two men broke into her house and caved
her head in with her own clock.

25:12.878 --> 25:16.680
I take it this Gavigan
boy is one of them.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.651
I dunno.

25:25.156 --> 25:27.591
You wouldn't be the best boy
for this job, would you?

25:31.162 --> 25:39.162
They have my sister. I do as they
or they're going to hurt her.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.544
They have lots of girls.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.880
What? Like pimps?

25:50.682 --> 25:53.002
You really don't want to start
messing around these people.

25:53.184 --> 25:56.320
Oh aye? Are they all as
bad as you, are they?

25:57.155 --> 26:00.691
Let me go and straighten
this out. Please.

26:01.126 --> 26:02.126
Please

26:04.930 --> 26:07.143
what are you going to tell them?

26:07.168 --> 26:11.593
That you hung a noose too low
and ballsed the whole thing up?

26:11.903 --> 26:15.606
If these boys are as bad as you say
they are, you're in a lot of bother.

26:16.207 --> 26:20.911
If he finds out what really
happened he's going to kill her.

26:22.314 --> 26:27.017
Well then the way I see
it, you need to help me.

27:02.320 --> 27:09.693
I tried to get to her once. Didn't
take them long to catch me though.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.265
You must have history of
ballsing things up, have you?

27:17.369 --> 27:18.402
Maybe.

27:20.905 --> 27:22.806
What do you call her anyway?

27:23.108 --> 27:29.980
Kaja. That's her real name. But I don't
know what they make her use now.

27:39.357 --> 27:40.724
I think that's her!

27:41.326 --> 27:43.093
That's not the man
was at the house.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.995
Gavigan must be inside.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.398
Right you go to the front door.
Now if you try anything,

27:48.066 --> 27:50.801
I swear to god, you'll be the
first one to get the two barrels.

27:50.803 --> 27:51.803
Happy enough?

27:53.038 --> 27:54.438
Grand. Come on.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.033
Where's Damien?

28:24.903 --> 28:26.070
He's not here yet?

28:30.241 --> 28:32.776
Is Damien here with us, Jerome?

28:47.492 --> 28:51.061
I swear. He said
he would be here.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.002
This was an important job.

28:59.938 --> 29:01.839
It came from herself.

29:02.807 --> 29:06.810
So of course I asked Dee to
bring proof that it was done.

29:09.013 --> 29:10.013
Have you got any?

29:12.450 --> 29:19.957
<i>Damien has the pictures on his phone.
You can't blame me, he's not here!</i>

29:20.992 --> 29:25.462
Please. I want to see my sister.

29:26.231 --> 29:27.231
She's not here.

29:27.332 --> 29:28.332
I just saw her come in.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.368
Oh, you mean her.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.037
Show him who he means.

30:11.176 --> 30:13.977
This is Sophia.
She tried to run.

30:14.312 --> 30:22.312
Now, management have very specific
rules about girls who try to run.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.878
Okay! Okay! Damien is dead!

30:49.380 --> 30:50.347
Did you kill him?

30:50.349 --> 30:56.186
No. The farmer did. Then
I killed the farmer.

30:59.958 --> 31:03.961
See. Doesn't it feel
good to tell the truth.

31:03.963 --> 31:07.130
Just, let me talk
with her at least.

31:07.932 --> 31:10.000
She's working. She doesn't
have time to talk.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.574
Don't feel too bad. This
was gonna happen anyway.

31:17.576 --> 31:18.576
No!

31:35.994 --> 31:39.630
<i>Hey! Let me out
the fuck!!</i>

31:44.068 --> 31:48.472
What going on in there, Jerome? Don't
you be interfering with that body.

31:56.414 --> 31:57.547
Put the hammer down.

31:59.183 --> 32:00.183
Put it down!

32:03.288 --> 32:06.089
Well. Is it him?

32:06.491 --> 32:09.993
No. But I'd say he knows.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.996
You're the farmer?

32:12.998 --> 32:17.301
You and me's gonna go and have a wee chat.
Now if you mess me about

32:17.303 --> 32:19.503
I'll splatter your head
all over that wall.

32:20.338 --> 32:21.371
Happy enough?

32:22.173 --> 32:23.173
Come on.

32:39.357 --> 32:42.592
You should have brought your tractor.
It might have been less conspicuous.

32:51.502 --> 32:55.272
How hard do you think it'll be to find a
Polack and a cultchie in a red camper van?

32:55.440 --> 32:57.407
Shut your Jesus mouth.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.409
Jesus Donal.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.111
Get him in the fuck.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.117
Sorry for your trouble.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.357
That wasn't my sister.

33:14.392 --> 33:15.392
Oh...

33:19.464 --> 33:21.231
Well she was belonging
to somebody somewhere.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.118
I just want to ask him
a lock of questions.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.758
Might be waiting a while.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.433
Could you eat?

34:44.514 --> 34:45.514
Get chatting.

34:46.617 --> 34:49.485
Go away and shite, you
dirty, boghopping whore.

34:51.822 --> 34:58.395
That's wild language. I bet a boy like
you has never spent a day in the bog.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.864
You just go around
robbing old ladies.

35:01.666 --> 35:04.701
Why couldn't you just
leave it at that?

35:05.703 --> 35:09.539
I dunno? Because she was a cunt?

35:15.513 --> 35:20.450
Aaaah! Aaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

35:22.220 --> 35:24.621
I'll not have anyone say a
bad word about Florence.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.857
Bartosz, have you forgotten
about your fucking sister?

35:26.859 --> 35:27.824
Never mind the sister.

35:27.826 --> 35:33.163
Look... if you just stop this
now, I'll forget about it.

35:43.241 --> 35:46.543
Look I didn't kill your
mother, I wasn't even there!

35:46.545 --> 35:47.545
So, who did?

35:49.747 --> 35:51.515
Ok, ok, ok!

35:53.885 --> 35:56.210
All I know is they
wanted you dead.

35:56.235 --> 35:59.914
So I sent this idiot and one
of my better men to do it.

36:00.224 --> 36:03.193
Who's they? Is one of them a
fancy looking sort of a boy?

36:06.330 --> 36:08.231
That's one way to describe him.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.470
His name is Trevor Ballantine.

36:14.438 --> 36:15.906
And who was the
other one with him?

36:18.576 --> 36:19.576
That's the boss.

36:38.663 --> 36:39.763
Frankie?

36:39.765 --> 36:42.832
<i>Come on up, I'm getting dressed.</i>

36:50.208 --> 36:51.541
<i>I'll just be a sec.</i>

36:52.910 --> 36:53.910
No rush.

37:01.219 --> 37:05.889
I took a look at the new
premises. They're expensive.

37:05.891 --> 37:11.995
<i>We can afford it. It would be
good for us to be more upmarket.</i>

37:12.330 --> 37:14.598
People are going there
for one thing, Frankie.

37:15.299 --> 37:18.535
The outcome is always the
same. Upmarket or not.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.638
<i>We could charge more.</i>

37:22.573 --> 37:24.741
With the quality of people we have,
if we're going to start charging

37:24.743 --> 37:28.578
customers more we need to
offer something other than a

37:29.313 --> 37:30.981
better postcode

37:30.983 --> 37:35.542
and then you start getting
into specialist services.

37:35.567 --> 37:39.007
And then you start
attracting weirdos.

37:40.391 --> 37:43.293
And I've dealt with enough
fucking weirdos in my time.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.930
Yes. Yes you have.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.399
Thank you Trevor.

37:53.604 --> 37:54.904
So how's Gavigan getting on?

37:55.306 --> 37:58.575
Good. He's all over it.

37:59.277 --> 38:04.047
So, this Frankie Pierce and
Ballantine are... burglars...

38:05.616 --> 38:11.588
Out on a job... get panicked
when Florence wakes...

38:14.425 --> 38:18.528
And they kill her... then they put
you in charge of getting rid of me?

38:18.530 --> 38:19.896
You haven't a fucking clue.

38:21.732 --> 38:24.013
Well if they weren't going to
rob us, why were they there?

38:24.402 --> 38:25.902
I don't know.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.541
Watch him. I'm away for a slash.

38:45.389 --> 38:48.925
Bartosz, Bartosz c'mere.

38:51.028 --> 38:56.066
If you snip these cable-ties I'll make
sure Frankie never finds out about this.

39:06.477 --> 39:10.013
How about you just tell me
what name Kaja is using?

39:12.350 --> 39:15.051
Ok. They call her

39:17.922 --> 39:18.922
<i>fuck!</i>

39:22.026 --> 39:23.526
What in the name of Jesus?

39:26.464 --> 39:28.498
Useless as tits on a boar.

39:57.928 --> 39:58.928
Come on...

40:18.682 --> 40:23.086
You left something in the
car the other night.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.102
I was wondering where they were.

40:33.998 --> 40:35.131
Is it sorted?

40:35.533 --> 40:38.034
I'm in a fucking
bind here, Trevor!

40:39.103 --> 40:40.603
Ok, slow down.

40:43.641 --> 40:47.844
No I haven't fucking taken care of it!
He's chasing me right now.

40:49.046 --> 40:50.447
Who's chasing you?

40:50.714 --> 40:51.714
<i>Frankie?</i>

40:54.018 --> 40:58.087
Oh shit... the farmer.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.024
<i>What have you told him?</i>

41:01.026 --> 41:02.826
<i>I'm sorry, Frankie. He's
a fucking headcase!</i>

41:02.851 --> 41:04.210
<i>He burned me with
a pot of beans!</i>

41:16.574 --> 41:17.574
All over it?

41:18.909 --> 41:21.244
It's fine. We'll fix it.

41:38.929 --> 41:46.135
I'll make sure your sister knows that you're
the reason I'm sawing her hands and feet off.

41:48.906 --> 41:49.906
Hey boy!

42:12.563 --> 42:13.563
Is it bad?

42:17.234 --> 42:18.535
Please... help me.

42:19.637 --> 42:20.637
Where do I find Pierce?

42:21.005 --> 42:22.005
Please.

42:25.976 --> 42:27.076
Take me to a hospital.

42:27.244 --> 42:28.244
Donal, we should

42:28.612 --> 42:30.046
I won't say anything!

42:34.118 --> 42:37.687
Alisha. They call
your sister Alisha.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.766
Here. Come on now.

42:59.109 --> 43:01.044
We'll need a spade
for that ground.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.850
Bartosz came in asking
about his sister.

43:08.852 --> 43:10.286
What sort of a name is Bartosz?

43:10.288 --> 43:11.187
Polish.

43:11.189 --> 43:17.126
Him and Dee were supposed to do in
some farmer. But Dee never came back.

43:17.828 --> 43:20.129
How is it that
you're still here?

43:21.599 --> 43:23.132
He locked me in the store.

43:23.734 --> 43:26.002
You should have handled the
farmer personally, Trevor.

43:26.004 --> 43:27.837
Isn't that what we
pay Gavigan for?

43:28.005 --> 43:29.672
You're the fucking prick he saw.

43:30.341 --> 43:33.710
Jerome, which of these
whores is the pole's sister?

43:34.845 --> 43:38.715
I can't remember her name,
there's that many of them.

43:38.717 --> 43:42.085
Y'know Jerome, being a big cunt
isn't really good enough anymore.

43:42.219 --> 43:47.924
You need to know shit as well. Listen to what's
going on around you. D'you hear what I'm saying?

43:48.626 --> 43:49.325
Yeah.

43:49.327 --> 43:55.331
Do you hear what what I'm
fucking, fucking, saying?

43:58.402 --> 43:59.235
Yes, Frankie.

43:59.237 --> 44:02.805
You personally find
out who this girl is

44:02.807 --> 44:06.009
and you go along to see how someone with
a fucking brain functions in the world.

44:08.112 --> 44:09.746
I'm gonna try Gavigan again.

44:20.357 --> 44:22.725
This is the third person
I've buried this week.

44:31.769 --> 44:34.837
They instigated this.
This is not our fault.

44:38.909 --> 44:43.046
I think we may have to take
some of the blame for this one.

44:57.995 --> 44:58.995
Hello?

45:00.698 --> 45:05.768
<i>Oh hi there. We should talk about
this before anyone else gets hurt.</i>

45:06.437 --> 45:08.204
Same way as you talked to my ma?

45:08.772 --> 45:10.206
<i>If that's how you want it.</i>

45:12.943 --> 45:15.445
I just want to know why.

45:15.447 --> 45:18.381
<i>If you have to ask that then you
didn't know her that well at all.</i>

45:19.116 --> 45:23.252
<i>I know you think it was just a
case of wrong place, wrong time.</i>

45:23.754 --> 45:26.456
<i>But believe me she's had a
target on her back for years.</i>

45:26.458 --> 45:31.394
Target on her back? She was
a wee innocent old doll!

45:33.230 --> 45:35.064
<i>Yeah you keep telling
yourself that.</i>

45:35.799 --> 45:40.470
I only have to tell myself the
once. Targets on your back now.

45:43.474 --> 45:47.844
'Targets on your back? Are
you a fucking assassin now?

45:48.979 --> 45:50.346
Where are we going?

46:05.362 --> 46:06.429
Donal?

46:06.431 --> 46:07.431
You alright?

46:08.165 --> 46:10.066
Ah, middling enough I suppose.

46:12.102 --> 46:14.437
Nothing strange going on?

46:15.839 --> 46:16.839
Not that I know of.

46:19.109 --> 46:21.844
You and your mate wanna
come in for a mug of tea?

46:22.012 --> 46:26.949
No he's alright in the Van.
I'll maybe take a quick drop.

46:37.327 --> 46:40.396
Good to see you have your
mind off your mother anyway.

46:41.031 --> 46:42.832
There you go.

46:42.834 --> 46:48.538
Aye, speaking of that, do
you know this boy here?

46:50.974 --> 46:51.974
Where'd you get this?

46:53.210 --> 46:56.012
Ma's room. Under a matress.

46:56.246 --> 46:59.182
You know, there was something
came through the letter

46:59.184 --> 47:01.984
box the other day that you
might be interested in.

47:04.021 --> 47:05.021
Eamon.

47:10.961 --> 47:12.605
He was a friend of hers.

47:12.630 --> 47:17.424
After your old boy died he helped her out.
He was very good to her.

47:18.168 --> 47:23.072
Was there something going on?

47:24.007 --> 47:28.544
God no. They were just good friends.
He had his own family and all.

47:29.346 --> 47:33.616
That's the daughter there.
Frances. He called her Frankie.

47:39.056 --> 47:40.056
What was his name?

47:41.992 --> 47:42.992
Joe Pierce.

47:45.195 --> 47:48.164
He died, years ago.

47:50.868 --> 47:54.370
Got involved with the wrong people at
a time when that was the thing to do.

47:57.040 --> 48:01.444
Them same people then started to think
that he was talking to the government.

48:03.413 --> 48:07.216
Your mother, she tried
to help him out.

48:08.118 --> 48:16.118
Let him hide out at the caravan down on Montague
beach but they caught up with him. Killed him.

48:19.363 --> 48:21.403
I never knew anything
about that.

48:23.133 --> 48:26.235
Your mother didn't want you to have
any part of what went on back then.

48:28.272 --> 48:30.006
There's some bad
friggers in this world,

48:30.008 --> 48:33.476
you're lucky you did not have
to deal with any of them.

48:36.914 --> 48:40.149
So she took you and headed off
to the glorious countryside.

48:42.352 --> 48:46.255
In another life you could have
been an oul townie, just like me.

48:47.257 --> 48:51.260
Ah! For Jesus'
sake. Here we are.

48:51.995 --> 48:54.664
Might be a nice place for
a wee bit of holidaying.

49:11.481 --> 49:12.481
So?

49:15.185 --> 49:17.086
Have you the Google
on that thing?

49:22.092 --> 49:23.092
'The Google?'

49:25.062 --> 49:28.164
just type in the name 'Joe
Pierce' and less of the buck.

49:30.734 --> 49:36.539
There's a few recent news
articles that mention Joe Pierce.

49:36.541 --> 49:37.541
Show me that.

49:44.047 --> 49:45.114
Give me the gist.

49:45.116 --> 49:51.654
Former prominent Ira commander Leo McMahon
died in palliative care this week

49:51.656 --> 49:54.190
after a long battle with cancer.

49:54.424 --> 49:58.294
McMahon was suspected of carrying
out a string of political murder

49:58.296 --> 50:01.330
with long time collaborator Joe
Pierce in the seventies...

50:01.332 --> 50:03.032
What has this got to
do with anything?

50:04.701 --> 50:06.669
I dunno. Yet.

50:06.671 --> 50:09.238
Well if you don't fucking know,
can we go and get my sister?

50:09.373 --> 50:12.174
I told you, lad. We get Pierce first.
Then we go get your sister.

50:12.176 --> 50:17.113
Right. What if getting Kaja
could get you to Pierce?

50:17.547 --> 50:20.049
Remember how I said I
tracked her down before?

50:20.617 --> 50:25.588
She told me about Pierce. She knew
about her business, where she lives.

50:29.092 --> 50:30.493
They have mad orgies there.

50:31.061 --> 50:32.762
And how does your sister
know all of this.

50:34.564 --> 50:37.033
They would make her take part.

50:40.037 --> 50:42.505
She knows where Frankie Pierce
lives, Donal.

50:42.507 --> 50:46.375
I know the number. Now I
know the name they've given her.

50:47.044 --> 50:49.078
You just have to
call and arrange to meet.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.080
Away and shite.

50:51.448 --> 50:54.450
They know me and they know my voice. So
you have to call and ask for Alisha.

50:54.452 --> 50:56.652
And say what?

50:56.654 --> 51:00.122
Just pretend you're lonely and you
need some company. Come on. Come on!

51:00.290 --> 51:02.425
<i>Paper lantern Chinese,
how can I help?</i>

51:02.427 --> 51:07.329
Hello? Uh, is Alisha about?

51:08.231 --> 51:10.099
<i>Sorry no one by that
name works here.</i>

51:10.333 --> 51:12.234
Oh. Right.

51:13.770 --> 51:15.738
<i>Anything else I can
help you will</i>

51:17.374 --> 51:21.177
no I just wanted to
speak to Alisha.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.846
<i>I'm afraid you've got
the wrong number.</i>

51:28.685 --> 51:33.622
They hung up. It's a Chinese take away.
Not a whore in the place.

51:36.626 --> 51:39.795
Sorry. No need for
that language.

51:40.430 --> 51:43.365
It's a front. Just try again.

51:46.236 --> 51:48.370
<i>Paper lantern Chinese.</i>

51:48.538 --> 51:54.443
Aye hello, I meant to say
to you earlier,

51:55.112 --> 51:58.714
Gavigan gave me this number and
told me to ask for Alisha.

52:04.321 --> 52:06.722
<i>Continental apartments.
Six o'clock.</i>

52:08.592 --> 52:11.193
We're grand. Six o'clock.

52:15.198 --> 52:16.899
We'll need to lie
low for a while.

52:19.836 --> 52:22.738
And we also need to get you
something else to wear.

52:28.812 --> 52:31.180
Hang on I'll go and see
if Eamon has a suit.

52:53.770 --> 52:55.638
I don't understand?

52:58.375 --> 53:00.095
Did you never hear of
hiding in plain sight?

53:22.933 --> 53:24.833
Tell me you have positive news.

53:25.702 --> 53:27.469
<i>We've found the pole's sister.</i>

53:27.904 --> 53:29.338
You have her?

53:29.340 --> 53:31.974
<i>Jerome's on his way. I'm
coming to lift you.</i>

53:31.976 --> 53:33.609
Put the foot down.

53:36.513 --> 53:38.280
Mum?

53:38.282 --> 53:39.915
Why are you not doing
your homework?

53:42.419 --> 53:44.286
What are you doing?

53:44.288 --> 53:49.325
I'm just reading some
stories about your grandad.

53:50.727 --> 53:51.760
Why?

53:51.762 --> 53:59.762
Because it's important to remember people.
And he would have loved to have met you.

54:03.840 --> 54:07.643
And he would have been really annoyed
that you haven't finished your homework.

54:08.511 --> 54:09.511
So go on.

54:26.363 --> 54:30.266
Relax. You look fine.

54:32.035 --> 54:33.402
I look like a tube.

54:35.472 --> 54:36.472
Almost time.

54:42.445 --> 54:45.681
Gimme your number. In case.
I need you to come in.

54:46.283 --> 54:49.018
Hold on.

54:50.387 --> 54:55.658
Oh, seven, double eight, six...

55:23.853 --> 55:24.953
Alright mate.

55:26.056 --> 55:27.056
Hello.

55:31.861 --> 55:32.861
How you doing?

55:33.763 --> 55:34.763
Alright.

55:37.801 --> 55:39.101
Another fifty, boss.

55:51.848 --> 55:52.848
In you go.

56:02.525 --> 56:03.625
Behave yourself.

56:40.997 --> 56:43.665
Hello. Would you like a drink?

56:44.534 --> 56:45.534
How you doing, Kaja?

56:47.470 --> 56:49.405
Your brother tracked you down.

56:55.445 --> 57:00.682
I told you I'll be good now. I'll behave.
Just, please don't hurt him.

57:00.684 --> 57:02.818
No. Bartosz is with me.

57:03.953 --> 57:05.521
Come on we need to leave.

57:05.523 --> 57:09.158
Look he's been trying to get at
you now for a lock of weeks.

57:19.702 --> 57:20.702
There you are.

57:31.981 --> 57:32.981
Kaja?

57:33.550 --> 57:34.550
Bartosz?

57:45.128 --> 57:46.128
What about him?

57:46.130 --> 57:50.065
Go you and get ready,
I'll worry about him.

57:56.806 --> 57:57.906
What's your name?

57:58.708 --> 57:59.708
Donal.

57:59.876 --> 58:01.477
How do you know my brother?

58:01.744 --> 58:02.811
He tried to kill me.

58:03.112 --> 58:04.112
What?

58:05.114 --> 58:06.982
It's all sorted now though.

58:14.157 --> 58:16.592
<i>Albert!! Help me!!</i>

58:36.012 --> 58:37.613
Where does Frankie Pierce live?

58:37.615 --> 58:38.847
Who?

58:39.115 --> 58:42.184
Y'know... your woman who
runs them... orgies.

58:42.819 --> 58:44.987
What the fuck are
you talking about?

58:48.291 --> 58:49.725
Your brother's some boy.

59:01.137 --> 59:03.138
Come on boy, tell
me about Pierce.

59:03.140 --> 59:04.706
Fuck off.

59:08.144 --> 59:09.811
What are you doing? Come on.

59:32.101 --> 59:34.303
I don't know anything
about Pierce.

59:34.305 --> 59:35.737
Well what about Ballantine?

59:38.041 --> 59:39.041
You're a lying shite.

59:42.679 --> 59:43.679
Fuck!

59:49.185 --> 59:50.953
Ok, alright, fuck!

59:50.955 --> 59:54.022
Ok, alright alright
alright alright.

59:56.659 --> 59:57.859
Pass me the pen.

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.077
Well holy fuck.

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.137
Lovely.

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:56.972
Help!

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:06.481
Jerome's dead.

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:11.019
Sure he is. It's for
the best. Probably.

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.560
What did you tell the farmer?

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:21.997
Nothing about you.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:27.169
My head feels like it's
bleeding from the inside.

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:30.138
Jeez, that's not good.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.440
Here let me help you with that.

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:38.880
Frankie... we already have
one dead body to deal with.

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:48.089
It's ok Trevor. What was it
you said? 'We'll fix this.'

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:49.825
yeah.

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:56.531
Cunt! Cunt! Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:47.549
She knows nothing about Pierce.

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:51.353
Orgies my hole.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.423
I had to tell you something.
And you almost got her killed.

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:59.494
I've an address for that hole
Ballantine works out of.

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.230
You're barely able to stand up.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:03.531
You don't have to go.

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:06.968
I want to.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:10.372
Whoah whoah whoah, whoah. We just
freed you from these people.

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:11.907
Yeah. Both of you did.

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:19.147
Jesus, you are both
as bad as each other.

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:21.216
Put that into your sat-nav.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.462
Were you and your mother close?

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.501
Close enough, aye.

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:42.037
Why do you think they do this

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:47.609
Frankie thought she had something to do
with her father's death. But she's wrong.

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:52.180
Do you have anyone
else back home?

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:59.487
No. But I'm dead on.
What about you?

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:05.215
We have a big family but I
didn't appreciate them.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.253
I wanted to escape, so I did.

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:15.479
I got to London. I was excited,
nervous, being on my own.

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:18.290
And one day it just happened.

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:30.447
They took me in the
middle of the street.

01:06:30.472 --> 01:06:34.373
In broad daylight.
And brought me here.

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.230
After a while I just
stopped fighting.

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:47.769
That's Tara...

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:50.572
What does Tara mean?

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.675
Bad.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:07:00.615
Thanks for helping me back there.
I meant to say to you earlier...

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:08.617
It's ok. It didn't feel real, the way his
body slumped over. I keep seeing it.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.160
Aye.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.168
That's the boy there.

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:23.405
A 'Tara' man.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.475
You can say that alright.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:02.811
Frankie.

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:05.346
You sure?

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:07.515
I'm sure alright.

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:15.223
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa, whoa! Here?

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.591
It's a good enough spot.

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:25.834
Look at this shit. Look.

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:31.206
Let me see.

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:40.215
Fair enough. We'll come back
when the child's asleep.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:08.710
Hang on, who's that?

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:23.224
Did they follow us?

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:24.658
They must have got to Eamon.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:27.662
There will probably
still be someone there.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:28.830
I hope so.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.798
Donal I have just got Kaja back.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.533
You do what you want Bartosz but

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.836
child or no child,

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:35.937
Frankie's not going to get away
with killing an innocent woman.

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:39.274
What if she wasn't
innocent Donal?

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.482
What did you say?

01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:51.386
I think you should
stop and go home.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:55.323
I asked you a question.
What. Did. You. Say?

01:09:55.325 --> 01:09:57.325
You don't know the full story.

01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:01.563
No-one seems to know the full story.
That's the problem with this country.

01:10:01.565 --> 01:10:02.697
Maybe Frankie had a reason.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:03.765
Get the fuck off me!

01:10:03.767 --> 01:10:05.833
Stop it! Both of you!

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:10.371
You're gonna get us all fucking killed!
I'm not gonna be part of it anymore.

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:11.673
You feel the same way, Cutty?

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:13.408
I didn't know she had a child.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.443
You are some Craic.

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:19.280
Both of youse can get
out right here and now.

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.616
We're on the side of the road!

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:25.353
I was gonna shoot you in my shed when we
first met, so you're not doing to bad.

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:27.689
Fuck you, Donal.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.832
You didn't kill me because
I didn't deserve it.

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:42.303
That'll get you both a flight.

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:48.643
And you'll need that too.

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:02.690
What you making there?

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:03.925
Ice-cream!

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:04.927
What flavour?

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:06.661
Vanilla.

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:17.438
You find him?

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.740
<i>At a caravan park.</i>

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.009
Sensational.

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:28.049
<i>But... they saw me. I'm still looking.
Sorry Frankie. I'll get them.</i>

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:31.552
Well?

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:36.457
Your mummy is surrounded
by silly men, pet.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.995
Don't worry. We'll get him.

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.064
Will we?

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:49.504
You should have handled the
farmer personally, Trevor.

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.339
That's not really my area.

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.608
You were the silly man he saw.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:56.344
Yes I know. But I was
only there for you.

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:57.745
Because I pay you.

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:04.986
Oh, you think because we fucked once, you
have to run around looking after me?

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:08.022
I told you not to kill her.

01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:13.928
If you use the word 'kill' in front of my
daughter again I'll shoot you through both eyes.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.668
You pay me for advice.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.670
No, I don't.

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:25.106
What?

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:27.508
You're sacked.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.611
Get out. Without making a fuss.

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:34.415
Come on Frankie.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:39.387
Come on Trevor. You
know how this will go.

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:41.856
Say goodbye to Trevor, pet.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.524
Goodbye, Trevor.

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:45.626
Goodbye, Trevor.

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.034
Bye Josie.

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.416
<i>Look, Frankie-</i>

01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:10.485
come get me. I know where
the farmer is going.

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.480
Jesus Eamon, what are you doing?

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:51.919
I thought my mobile was up here.
Can't find the fucking thing.

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:57.658
Forget about it. I wasn't trying
to call an ambulance.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:02.997
I was trying to call you. I left half
my guts out there on the stairs.

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:05.266
Fuck.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.635
You need to stop.

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:14.008
Leave Frankie Peirce
alone. Call it a draw.

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.276
It's not a draw.

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.279
I know you idolised your ma...

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.081
Now Eamon don't.

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.629
I should have told you the
minute you turned up here.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:29.957
Maybe none of this would have happened.
I would still have my guts.

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:31.893
Should have told me what?

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:38.933
She was having an affair with
Joe Pierce, but...

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:47.608
She still gave him up to Leo and his boys.
Because they threatened you.

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:53.748
That's not true.
That's not true.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:16:03.250
Frankie found out and she couldn't let
it lie. Just like you can't let it lie.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.863
And the whole fucking
thing goes on and on...

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:15.236
Make sure they clean my stairs.

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.111
Eamon?

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.041
Sorry horse.

01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.680
Let me go in first.

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.316
When you see him,
don't hesitate.

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:04.218
I know you like fucking around,

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.253
slicing bellies and all
that shit.

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:08.575
Which is something we're going
to talk about down the road.

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.891
We're not the shankill butchers.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:13.961
I know. I'll be grand.
He's only a farmer.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.697
That must be why he's not
causing any problems then.

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:20.635
Go in shooting and less of the backchat.
Or you'll be the one getting sliced.

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:21.869
Right.

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:52.967
Up. Slowly.

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:23.097
Bollocks.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.111
Give me that pistol.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.213
Fuck.

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:54.862
We're going out to the Van, slowly. If
you try anything, you'll get the barrel.

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:56.964
Happy enough?

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:04.772
Ok, Donal. You're the boss.

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:13.247
You're driving.

01:20:03.933 --> 01:20:05.933
Any chance I could answer that?

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:07.401
No.

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:14.842
Oh I know where we're going.

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:17.044
Just shh now.

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:49.610
What are you doing?

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:54.982
I need to get rid of this.

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:02.957
Go back to sleep.

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:28.082
So. Here we are.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.160
Speak.

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.663
The fucking farmer has Frankie.

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:44.131
Where are you?

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:34.949
Is that Donal's blood?

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:45.192
He's not here. Do you
know where they went?

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:48.329
No.

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:51.572
You've just spent a
couple of days together.

01:22:51.597 --> 01:22:55.126
And you have no idea where
they might be going?

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:02.076
If he's got her, then it's over.

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:07.748
I'm leaving. You should as well.

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:14.488
Not just yet.

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:43.083
Fuck fuck fuck!

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:14.481
I know there was something...

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:19.053
Going on between
Florence and your da.

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:24.491
I know she gave him up
to Leo and his boys.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.431
But what she did, she
did it to protect me.

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:36.170
I can understand that. A
mother protecting her son.

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:37.805
That's all it was.

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:47.081
I went to see Leo McMahon in the hospice
before he died. It was disgusting.

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:51.493
Surrounded by nurses and
doctors caring for him.

01:24:51.518 --> 01:24:54.855
I wanted to strangle
him with his catheter.

01:24:54.857 --> 01:24:58.092
But I didn't. I made him talk.

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:01.261
And the things he told me...

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.263
You're just looking more time.

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:15.843
Leo came here because
Florence told him to.

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:19.780
But when he got here, somebody had
shot my father once through the jaw.

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:25.619
The police found Leo at the scene and
I'm sure you've googled the rest.

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:32.593
Leo told you a pack of lies.

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:35.229
That's what I thought.

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:40.601
Which is why I went
to see your ma.

01:26:06.427 --> 01:26:07.928
What are you fucking smiling at?

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:11.598
You... look so like him.

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:17.404
Everyone says that.

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:22.442
The same eyes the same shape
of a face.

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:30.450
We never had a pile of time together
but I still remember every detail.

01:26:33.421 --> 01:26:38.692
Him. The caravan. Our wee beach.

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:42.796
He loved the water.

01:26:42.798 --> 01:26:50.798
Even if it was raining it was nice to
get away from the madness of Belfast.

01:26:54.442 --> 01:27:00.247
The odd time we would
even spend the night.

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:02.549
Who did you call to
come and kill him?

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:08.222
I could never have done
that. I loved him.

01:27:08.224 --> 01:27:10.257
No don't say that.

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:14.628
It's the truth. I loved him, I
loved him more than myself...

01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:16.863
More than my own son...

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.767
You wouldn't understand.

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:22.703
Why?

01:27:22.705 --> 01:27:26.406
I can tell by looking at you that
you've never felt anything like that.

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:43.016
And he loved me as well. But that
didn't matter. He had a family.

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:52.466
That night he told me it was
over. He put on his coat.

01:27:53.601 --> 01:28:00.274
He lifted his bag. He said he would
never be coming back to the beach.

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:06.813
His gun was sitting
on the table.

01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:13.020
Oh, god... I'm so sorry...

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:16.056
Are you fucking joking me?

01:28:16.058 --> 01:28:20.861
I just wanted to stop him leaving. I
didn't mean it... I didn't mean it...

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:25.465
Aye well you covered your tracks so you
mustn't have been too fucking sad.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:28.035
You knew the police would arrest
Leo so you called them both.

01:28:28.037 --> 01:28:34.441
I had to. If I went to prison Donal
would have been left on his own.

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:44.418
Things would have been so much different...
if neither of us had children.

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.889
Donal! Help!

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.529
I was five years old
when she killed him.

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:00.567
I loved my daddy.

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:11.738
And now you're gonna do the same to me...
because that's what you do? Isn't it?

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:20.787
Turn around.

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:34.868
How do you feel? Leaving a
little girl without her mother?

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:05.132
I feel sorry for her.
Having a mother like you.

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:11.438
That's the end of it now. Ok?

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:17.611
What?

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.219
Sure that's not even load...

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:42.863
It's all over, Bartosz. I
gave her the chance but...

01:31:42.865 --> 01:31:43.865
<i>What's over?</i>

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:47.501
What have you done?

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:52.806
Where's Bartosz?

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:56.510
He's here. With me.

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:04.784
Please, the cub didn't do anything.
He had no part of this...

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:09.589
Jesus.

01:32:09.591 --> 01:32:12.092
<i>Let him go and I'll
come up there to you.</i>

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:13.960
Donal! Just go!

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:16.596
Let me talk to him.

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:41.955
Donal.

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:43.890
Why in under Jesus
did you come back?

01:32:47.194 --> 01:32:51.298
Wanted to help. Ballsed
it up I guess.

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:58.972
I'm sorry, cub. You were right,
I should have listened...

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:02.642
<i>Look I'm coming up
there right now.</i>

01:33:02.644 --> 01:33:03.843
They can take me...

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:15.322
If you want me, I'm
at your uncle's.

01:33:56.230 --> 01:34:00.000
<i>Emergency. Which service do you require?
Police, fire or ambulance?</i>

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:11.971
<i>Hello? Hello? Hello?</i>
