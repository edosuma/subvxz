02:07.210 --> 02:09.411
It is written in the heavens...

02:12.466 --> 02:15.635
that a life shall be mirrored in it's birth.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.930
Like a reflection in water.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.226
Fleeting but true.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.439
And so it was for Helle.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.318
Daughter of Asmund.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.706
The one and only true heir...

02:38.700 --> 02:41.372
to the king of Volsung.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.789
A kingdom under attack.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.190
I'm here, my love.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.732
And you should not be.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.820
The kingdom needs you in battle.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.578
But it is a bad omen for a child
to be born with an absent father.

03:16.618 --> 03:20.955
It would be worse luck if our child
was born into slavery.

03:30.585 --> 03:34.385
My lords, bring your king his sword.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.221
He has a battle to win.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.899
The king was victorious that day,

04:31.354 --> 04:33.356
but he had spoken the truth.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.447
- It is a curse for a child...
- No!

04:38.487 --> 04:41.240
To be worn with an absent father.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.124
No!

04:57.589 --> 05:00.427
The king had a brother

05:00.467 --> 05:04.847
as fingers have five brothers
but none are equals.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.977
With his brother's mind filled with grief,

05:09.017 --> 05:11.897
the half-prince, as he was known,

05:11.937 --> 05:12.813
took advantage,

05:14.064 --> 05:19.070
planting a seed that would take
20 years and one to ripen,

05:19.903 --> 05:23.158
knowing that patience is bitter,

05:23.198 --> 05:26.369
but it has the sweetest fruit.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.285
Do you trust me?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.791
You're my brother.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.875
My blood.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.883
So that may be the brother you need.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.258
We have just survived our enemy.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.637
If they hear that you're weak,
that you are mourning,

05:41.677 --> 05:42.892
they might strike again.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.186
If they hear that your heir is a girl,

05:46.226 --> 05:49.476
that weakness will seem greater still,

05:49.516 --> 05:52.771
and then they will certainly attack.

05:52.811 --> 05:53.778
That may be so.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.699
But I cannot change
the sex of my child, brother.

05:58.739 --> 06:00.110
No, you cannot, but I can.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.788
My own son was born just three days ago.

06:05.115 --> 06:09.752
You shall take him as your own,
and I will raise your daughter as mine.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.417
I can't.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.920
You can and you must.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.381
Think of your sanity, brother.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.010
Every time you look at this woman child,

06:22.050 --> 06:25.011
you will see the true cause of Alva's death.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.143
How can you be expected to love such a curse?

06:33.143 --> 06:35.237
The broken hand can mend.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.486
But a broken heart cannot.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.661
You will love her as your own.

06:44.701 --> 06:45.538
I will.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.291
As my word is my oath.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.086
Yes.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.172
It is a curse for a child to be born

07:01.212 --> 07:03.055
with an absent father.

09:17.015 --> 09:17.857
It seems

09:19.684 --> 09:22.649
you have learned all I have
to teach you, Princess.

09:25.106 --> 09:28.360
How I wish that one day I will see
real battle, but I never will.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.239
No wish can come true
that can't be kept secret.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.166
Then why do you keep my training a secret?

09:37.744 --> 09:38.620
If I told you,

09:40.580 --> 09:42.799
what hope would my wish have of coming true?

09:49.506 --> 09:50.928
I thank you for the favor.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.013
I may one day ask a favor of you in return.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.447
That's enough for today.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.416
I'm sorry, father.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.082
I will train harder.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.466
Longer.

11:09.752 --> 11:10.594
Hakon,

11:13.339 --> 11:15.637
I fear there are some things we cannot train.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.386
It is in your blood,

11:20.180 --> 11:21.022
or it is not.

11:22.223 --> 11:25.984
If it's in your blood,
it will be in your child's, father.

11:26.024 --> 11:28.648
And we will find it.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.150
Find it?

11:30.190 --> 11:30.986
Yes.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.492
And I know where it hides.

12:00.970 --> 12:05.476
A day of grief is longer than a year of joy.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.939
Your mother, I knew her well.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.030
Who are you?

12:13.858 --> 12:14.825
I demand your name.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.455
Such passion, such bravery.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.705
My, how you remind me of her.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.041
Are you of this world or the next?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.375
The next.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.877
From Valhalla.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.635
And I come with a message.

12:33.628 --> 12:37.303
Remember, however dark the forest,

12:38.132 --> 12:39.884
there is always a path through it.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.661
Maid, where is Princess Helle?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.043
Helle.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.632
What in the name of the gods are you doing?

13:12.542 --> 13:14.215
As my father commands, my king.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.471
My brother has you do the labor of a slave?

13:18.511 --> 13:20.133
He wishes to teach me humility.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.729
It surprises me to hear humility
is a trait he values.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.186
Do not judge my father
too harshly, dear uncle.

13:28.226 --> 13:30.812
Try to remember the burden
he's lived with all these years.

13:30.852 --> 13:31.694
Burden?

13:33.688 --> 13:34.610
I am a curse.

13:35.982 --> 13:36.824
You?

13:37.692 --> 13:39.279
A curse?

13:39.319 --> 13:42.115
My father could not be present at my birth

13:42.155 --> 13:45.332
for he was fighting heroically against
our enemies at your very side.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.580
And we know the gods curse a child
born with an absent father.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.217
My mother's death, that is my fault alone.

13:55.251 --> 13:59.221
Every time my father sees me is
a reminder that I took his beloved's life.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.677
This is the curse he lives with.

14:02.717 --> 14:03.559
The curse I am.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.186
He tells you all this.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.024
Honesty is another lesson
my father teaches rigorously.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.444
Humility, heroism, honesty.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.153
I'm seeing my brother
in a whole new light today.

14:26.579 --> 14:27.450
Enough with the fire.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.377
Tell me, Helle,

14:31.913 --> 14:33.460
have you ever held a sword?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.343
On my command.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.517
My brother, what happened here?

14:54.143 --> 14:54.985
Fight.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.522
I command you.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.904
As your king commands.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.452
Why is she here, brother?

15:09.492 --> 15:11.746
My heir is a coward, Bard.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.164
Hakon?

15:13.204 --> 15:14.581
I fear it is in his blood.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.169
Listen to me, Asmund.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.381
Kind Asmund.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.922
Right answer to a fool is silence.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.969
I did listen to you.

15:27.009 --> 15:27.851
Once.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.268
Did you know the gods stopped appearing
to me the night of Alva's death?

15:36.519 --> 15:37.941
All these years,

15:39.605 --> 15:42.609
I feared they'd abandoned me
as I abandoned my queen.

15:45.236 --> 15:48.115
Maybe the gods didn't abandon me
as I abandoned my wife.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.956
Maybe they abandoned me
as I abandoned my child.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.365
My dear Lord Soini,

16:29.363 --> 16:32.542
it is almost as if someone had been
training the girl all these years.

16:56.724 --> 17:00.228
Your mother was the bravest
woman I have ever known.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.487
She happily gave her life to save her people.

17:05.691 --> 17:09.286
She would be so very proud
of what you have become, child.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.656
As proud as your father is.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.868
My father could not care less.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.035
Hello, my curse.

17:58.953 --> 17:59.795
Father.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.419
I thought you asleep.

18:03.457 --> 18:06.961
How can I sleep when all I do
is worry about you?

18:08.588 --> 18:09.799
Worry?

18:09.839 --> 18:13.093
Of course, for I know what is in your heart.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.562
You wish the king was your father.

18:19.056 --> 18:19.898
Not I.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.979
But just as you are my curse,

18:28.316 --> 18:29.989
so I am yours.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.740
I raised you, not he.

18:42.830 --> 18:46.835
Do you know why you were
invited there to train?

18:49.420 --> 18:50.842
You are an opportunity.

18:52.089 --> 18:52.931
Nothing more.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.724
An opportunity to lower
the standard of warrior

18:57.764 --> 18:59.059
around the true heir,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.769
and hopefully raise the boy's confidence.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.271
That can't be true.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.187
Can it not?

19:09.440 --> 19:12.028
But just as you are an opportunity,

19:12.068 --> 19:14.070
so it is one for you.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.368
If you could only see it.

19:17.408 --> 19:18.951
See it?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.414
If you could truly prove your bravery,

19:22.703 --> 19:26.042
maybe he would see you as more
than just a prop for his son.

19:26.082 --> 19:26.924
How?

19:28.751 --> 19:29.593
No.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.091
No, it's too much.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.393
It isn't. Whatever it is,
it is not too much for me.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.556
If you ever felt anything
in your heart for me, father,

19:43.307 --> 19:44.149
please tell me.

19:47.061 --> 19:50.361
Only one thing scared my brother
when we were boys.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.160
And it still scares him today.

19:55.653 --> 19:59.617
The Kraken monster of the round cave.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.000
Kraken do not exist.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.124
And we must never think of such
foolish things, our king decrees it.

20:05.164 --> 20:07.460
Are you sure they don't exist?

20:08.290 --> 20:12.880
Are you sure talk of them wasn't
banned by your beloved king?

20:12.920 --> 20:13.928
Why would he do such a thing?

20:13.968 --> 20:16.591
Because truly,
it is the one thing that scares him,

20:17.425 --> 20:19.225
and because some men believe

20:19.265 --> 20:22.480
if you forget a thing long enough,
it will disappear.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.441
But it never does.

20:26.851 --> 20:27.904
I don't believe you.

20:27.944 --> 20:29.939
Our king is afraid of nothing.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.192
Of course you don't believe.

20:31.232 --> 20:32.356
What coward would?

20:33.315 --> 20:34.282
I'm not a coward.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.157
I'm a warrior.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.824
I'm a trained warrior.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.037
A real warrior would find out for certain,

20:43.534 --> 20:46.504
and then slay the beast where it drew.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.876
And if you kill the one thing
the king feared,

20:50.916 --> 20:52.962
then he might truly love you.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.852
Well played, my prince.

21:07.892 --> 21:08.893
Well played.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.523
Oh, how goodness shouts.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.862
And evil whispers.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.094
Cousin, can we talk?

21:42.134 --> 21:42.970
Not now.

21:43.010 --> 21:43.971
But it must be now.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.768
Then you'll have to join me.

21:45.808 --> 21:46.897
Where are you going?

21:48.349 --> 21:49.316
On an adventure.

21:57.525 --> 22:02.158
Helle, please tell me we're not going
where I think we're going.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.129
You said it would be just the girl.

22:24.468 --> 22:27.813
Rain does not fall on one roof alone.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.684
An unexpected pleasure then.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.900
So there is no anger later,

22:37.940 --> 22:41.362
exactly what are your expectations,
brother Bard?

22:41.402 --> 22:43.616
I expect that neither the girl nor the boy

22:43.656 --> 22:45.366
will leave the cave alive.

22:45.406 --> 22:47.660
Is that explanation enough?

22:47.700 --> 22:51.664
And how Asmund will regret letting his sex

22:51.704 --> 22:53.377
shrivel up in grief.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.921
For you, then, will be his only heir,

22:58.961 --> 23:00.634
Prince Bard.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.301
Am I paying for both?

23:04.341 --> 23:05.183
Just one.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.231
My warrior takes great pride in his work,

23:20.065 --> 23:22.194
and with a girl like that,

23:22.234 --> 23:24.783
he should also like to take great pleasure.

23:25.863 --> 23:29.869
But if your heart desires mercy...

23:29.909 --> 23:31.126
Mercy's for the weak.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.171
Do you see me as such?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.551
Did you not hear your orders?

23:47.551 --> 23:48.971
Helle.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.389
Helle.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.646
- I'm going in.
- What?

23:53.223 --> 23:56.312
If you don't want to walk with me,
you can go back, alone in the dark,

23:56.352 --> 24:00.404
and pray that a pack of wild wolves won't
catch you and rip the flesh from your bones.

24:09.907 --> 24:10.749
Helle.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.286
- Helle!
- Shh!

24:17.790 --> 24:21.670
Helle, please, I must tell you something.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.257
I really don't want to be king.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.805
Have you lost your senses?

24:26.845 --> 24:30.730
My father has lost his senses
if he considers me a king in waiting.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.473
I would be terrible.

24:32.513 --> 24:33.355
Terrible.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.521
Try and tell me that I'm wrong
without laughter.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.312
Hakon...

24:38.352 --> 24:39.563
It's true.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.445
We both know it.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.026
The lords know it and the king knows it, too.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.110
You can learn.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.823
I have proven that I cannot.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.072
I've proved it every day.

24:49.947 --> 24:53.201
And the longer it goes on,
the longer I will keep on proving it.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.870
I'm not brave.

24:56.912 --> 24:57.879
I'm not bold.

24:58.914 --> 24:59.836
I'm not strong.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.877
But I am smart.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.884
I have a brain, at least I can use that.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.554
And it's telling me
who should be our next king.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.305
Who?

25:12.803 --> 25:14.640
You, my dear cousin.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.520
No.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.731
There is no greater mirror
than a true friend.

25:22.771 --> 25:26.696
Please, Helle, let me show you
who you really are.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.240
The one and only true heir
to the kingdom of Volsung.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.537
What was that?

25:36.118 --> 25:37.955
The Kraken lives.

25:37.995 --> 25:38.837
Kraken?

26:06.982 --> 26:11.030
Helle.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.164
Father. Father.

26:21.705 --> 26:22.957
Father. Father.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.588
Helle.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.100
Helle.

27:08.085 --> 27:08.927
Hakon?

27:15.467 --> 27:16.810
Helle!

27:18.053 --> 27:18.895
Helle!

29:16.129 --> 29:17.802
Sleep is the cousin of death.

29:21.260 --> 29:25.515
And lo, how I have slept
all these years, Helle.

29:25.555 --> 29:26.397
I'm sorry.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.523
To look at you is to see your mother.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.613
She was a great woman.

29:34.815 --> 29:35.657
Better than I.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.778
And I have been a coward
and hidden from that too long.

29:40.821 --> 29:41.663
Forgive me.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.042
More than that, let me make amends.

29:47.077 --> 29:47.919
Amends?

29:49.746 --> 29:54.336
Hakon, to you, too, I owe an apology.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.462
Father?

29:55.502 --> 29:57.254
No, I am not.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.975
Nor should I have ever put
that burden on your shoulders.

30:04.553 --> 30:05.395
Father.

30:12.019 --> 30:12.861
Father?

30:20.736 --> 30:21.578
Run!

30:24.364 --> 30:25.664
Your kingdom needs you.

30:25.704 --> 30:27.253
Now more than ever, my queen.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.287
Run!

30:28.327 --> 30:29.663
For Volsung!

30:29.703 --> 30:30.545
Run!

30:55.729 --> 30:56.571
Kill.

31:12.537 --> 31:16.383
And when the old moon disappears completely,

31:17.250 --> 31:20.094
the new moon can finally come out.

31:49.783 --> 31:50.705
Where is she?

31:52.702 --> 31:54.170
We need her dead.

31:58.458 --> 31:59.755
We don't need her dead.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.179
We just need her blamed.

32:04.965 --> 32:05.926
Come.

32:05.966 --> 32:08.389
We must burn my brother.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.399
A knot tied by a wise man

33:00.562 --> 33:02.610
must not be undone by a fool.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.403
You must finish what your father cold not.

33:08.778 --> 33:12.703
Your mother, she happily gave
her life to save her people.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.037
I carried her to Valhalla myself,

33:16.077 --> 33:19.383
and in that moment as we crossed
to the next world,

33:19.423 --> 33:21.585
your father made a mistake.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.970
A mistake only you can rectify now.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.639
How?

33:34.679 --> 33:36.272
Truth has one color.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.478
A lie, many.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.647
Show your true color
and the world will believe.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.986
But first, survive.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.828
I would take your father
with me tonight, but not you.

33:53.657 --> 33:56.706
Survive, and we will meet again, Helle.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.711
The one true heir to the kingdom of Volsung.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.178
Lord Soini.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.347
Prince Bard.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.188
Prince?

35:01.391 --> 35:03.393
Surely I am your king now.

35:07.397 --> 35:10.822
Unless you think a traitor
should rule Volsung?

35:15.989 --> 35:18.367
I would never kneel to a traitor.

35:20.535 --> 35:21.707
Half-prince.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.129
Now is not the time, of course.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.922
But we really must discuss your position.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.014
Shall we say tomorrow?

35:36.635 --> 35:37.557
Let's meet here.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.062
My chambers.

35:41.056 --> 35:43.184
They used to be Asmund's.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.191
But after he burns,

35:46.394 --> 35:47.361
they will be mine.

35:49.397 --> 35:52.027
Like everything else in Volsung.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.170
What did he want?

36:06.039 --> 36:07.459
To kill me.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.421
Why?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.341
Because I know what he knows.

36:13.296 --> 36:16.266
The one true heir of Volsung is a queen,

36:18.885 --> 36:19.807
not a king.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.314
Gather our most loyal men.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.483
And after the funeral, we leave,

36:31.523 --> 36:35.576
and we search the whole world
if we have to until we find our queen.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.405
And we bring her home.

37:23.533 --> 37:27.122
That Helle would take our king from us,

37:27.162 --> 37:29.540
that she would kill my brother?

37:31.416 --> 37:34.795
How I wish this were a bad dream.

37:36.296 --> 37:39.300
As the bloodline dictates,

37:39.340 --> 37:41.183
as the gods demand,

37:42.302 --> 37:45.226
I will be your new king!

37:46.097 --> 37:47.809
But first...

38:01.279 --> 38:02.531
Goodbye, my brother!

38:05.408 --> 38:07.081
Onwards to Valhalla!

39:40.003 --> 39:42.426
When your thirst is quenched,

39:43.548 --> 39:45.676
let me feed you.

39:49.429 --> 39:50.351
Come, child.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.645
Feast at my feet.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.875
The mushrooms have a power.

40:24.297 --> 40:25.389
They blur the vision.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.347
And clear the mind.

40:43.316 --> 40:44.989
The hunger will end,

40:47.236 --> 40:50.285
but the loneliness will destroy you.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.541
I can end your loneliness.

40:58.331 --> 41:01.050
Let me take you to your parents, child.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.546
You have your father's blade.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.265
Take it to your soul.

41:10.259 --> 41:12.603
Feel the warmth of his love.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.022
Yes.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.609
Guide the blade deep inside,

41:20.353 --> 41:23.106
and I will guide you to Valhalla!

42:26.335 --> 42:28.047
Is it ready?

42:28.087 --> 42:29.509
Not quite, my king.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.144
My brother did love a sword.

42:40.850 --> 42:44.480
But then, imagination
was never really his thing.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.115
My noble brother,

42:49.942 --> 42:54.197
carrying on my noble father's noble legacy.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.749
Great leaders, my king.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.537
As you are, too, of course.

43:07.168 --> 43:08.755
Does it fit?

43:08.795 --> 43:10.882
It fits me, my king.

43:10.922 --> 43:11.764
Putiton.

43:32.401 --> 43:33.243
Beautiful.

43:34.987 --> 43:37.365
If it pleases my king, I can make more.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.838
No, you shall never make another.

43:43.329 --> 43:45.208
Please! Please!

43:45.248 --> 43:46.090
Please!

43:48.417 --> 43:51.380
If you see my brother, do say hello.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.475
This head fits well enough.

44:06.936 --> 44:09.314
But there is another
that will fit better still.

44:11.566 --> 44:12.988
She's already dead.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.614
Are you certain?

44:16.654 --> 44:18.786
How could she survive alone out there?

44:18.826 --> 44:19.915
She's just a girl.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.290
You promised me her body.

44:24.537 --> 44:25.914
Still I wait.

44:26.873 --> 44:29.001
So send men.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.420
Search the kingdoms.

44:31.460 --> 44:34.304
If she be dead, bring me her skull.

44:57.403 --> 44:58.746
Show yourselves, cowards.

45:00.281 --> 45:02.659
Come out and fight or be
damned by Odin himself.

45:19.175 --> 45:21.177
Why would we want to fight you?

45:22.970 --> 45:24.142
Show me your weapons.

45:29.310 --> 45:31.731
If a man's as wise as a snake,

45:31.771 --> 45:34.490
he can afford to be as harmless as a mouse.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.652
We need no weapons.

45:38.861 --> 45:41.205
And if we don't need weapons,
you don't either.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.785
You can put down your sword.

45:44.825 --> 45:45.667
Never.

45:47.078 --> 45:48.497
Suit yourself.

45:48.537 --> 45:49.663
Let's be off, you two.

45:51.457 --> 45:52.965
Halt or I will kill you.

45:53.779 --> 45:54.547
Why?

45:55.962 --> 45:57.590
Why would you kill us?

45:57.630 --> 46:00.551
Why would you kill anything, man or beast?

46:00.591 --> 46:01.769
And why do you lie?

46:01.809 --> 46:03.596
Lie? What about?

46:03.636 --> 46:04.940
At the very least,
you lie about your weapons.

46:04.980 --> 46:05.899
Where are they?

46:05.939 --> 46:07.350
We have no weapons.

46:07.390 --> 46:08.898
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

46:08.938 --> 46:10.978
Liar. How do you hunt?

46:11.018 --> 46:12.270
Simple. We don't hunt.

46:13.145 --> 46:13.987
You don't hunt.

46:14.939 --> 46:15.983
How do you eat?

46:16.023 --> 46:17.156
You cannot survive without meat.

46:17.196 --> 46:18.402
How do you live?

46:18.442 --> 46:20.529
And yet, here I am.

46:20.569 --> 46:23.824
My father lived 86 years on this earth,

46:23.864 --> 46:25.662
and I plan to live longer still.

46:26.909 --> 46:29.378
How many viking fathers live to such an age?

46:32.415 --> 46:34.918
Would you care to join us for turnips?

46:36.836 --> 46:38.381
I have enough food.

46:38.421 --> 46:39.590
Don't worry.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.009
We'll not be eating the turnips.

47:13.331 --> 47:14.173
Turnips.

47:31.932 --> 47:34.103
How long have you been here?

47:34.143 --> 47:35.235
A few months.

47:36.937 --> 47:38.983
But where do you come from?

47:39.023 --> 47:40.443
Everywhere.

47:40.483 --> 47:41.986
We follow the harvest.

47:42.026 --> 47:44.405
Wherever it grows, we go.

47:44.445 --> 47:47.533
North in the summer, south in the winter.

47:47.573 --> 47:49.246
We are the travelers.

47:51.285 --> 47:53.253
And travelers carry no weapons.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.082
Travelers need no weapons.

47:58.918 --> 48:00.090
But who is your king?

48:06.008 --> 48:07.511
And him.

48:07.551 --> 48:09.138
Him, too.

48:09.178 --> 48:10.179
And she's a queen.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.266
And so's she.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.769
You see, we're all kings and queens here.

48:14.809 --> 48:15.856
We're all equal.

48:19.313 --> 48:20.690
You haven't asked me anything.

48:22.858 --> 48:25.488
A song can only be heard when it's sung.

48:25.528 --> 48:26.370
It can wait.

48:31.867 --> 48:32.789
Can I stay?

48:33.702 --> 48:34.544
Tonight.

48:36.997 --> 48:39.170
The first night, you're a friend.

48:40.126 --> 48:41.462
The second?

48:41.502 --> 48:42.344
A sister.

48:44.630 --> 48:45.424
Thank you.

48:45.464 --> 48:48.219
This is yours as much as it's ours.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.511
Stay as long as you like.

48:51.637 --> 48:52.479
Dance?

48:53.639 --> 48:54.725
Oh, no.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.977
- I don't.
- Yes, dance.

49:37.391 --> 49:38.233
Shh.

49:39.101 --> 49:39.943
Shh.

49:41.437 --> 49:42.898
Calm yourself.

49:43.781 --> 49:47.069
The more you panic, the quicker the end,

49:47.109 --> 49:49.328
and I have much to tell you before then.

49:50.821 --> 49:53.916
Please, don't be selfish.

49:57.203 --> 49:59.581
Do you know why they call me the half-prince?

50:00.581 --> 50:03.630
We have the same mother, Asmund and I,

50:05.211 --> 50:07.714
but my true father was a Sickling.

50:09.465 --> 50:13.471
When Asmund's father the king
was off fighting some war,

50:13.511 --> 50:17.857
my blood father attacked Volsung
and raped our mother.

50:21.310 --> 50:22.527
No one knows.

50:24.605 --> 50:27.074
Or at least no one dare talk of it.

50:38.244 --> 50:39.086
Oh.

50:40.204 --> 50:41.080
Our pleasures are

50:42.164 --> 50:43.006
shallow.

50:44.208 --> 50:46.128
Our sorrows deep.

50:46.168 --> 50:47.630
Our lies.

50:47.670 --> 50:48.512
Yes.

50:50.506 --> 50:53.052
Score years and one I have waited

50:53.092 --> 50:56.263
for greater pleasures than this.

50:56.303 --> 50:59.557
It is easy to cut the tail of a dead wolf,

51:01.475 --> 51:06.273
and our wolf is finally ready to die.

51:12.194 --> 51:12.988
Enough?

51:14.572 --> 51:15.414
Not nearly.

51:17.324 --> 51:18.410
We're leaving tomorrow.

51:18.450 --> 51:22.081
The last night of camp
means the biggest fire.

51:22.121 --> 51:23.623
And the biggest celebration.

51:25.624 --> 51:26.585
Keep cutting.

51:26.625 --> 51:27.878
Ugh.

51:30.337 --> 51:31.179
Helle?

51:33.465 --> 51:35.217
I'm so glad you're here.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.520
What's it like?

51:43.809 --> 51:44.651
What?

51:47.187 --> 51:49.861
Using a blade for more than wood.

51:52.526 --> 51:53.652
Not what I expected.

52:01.327 --> 52:03.830
You think it will be exciting.

52:06.999 --> 52:07.841
An adventure.

52:11.879 --> 52:13.005
And then someone dies.

52:16.884 --> 52:18.387
Someone you love.

52:23.432 --> 52:24.524
And in that moment...

52:27.978 --> 52:30.697
You realize that this is not a game.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.652
This is the end.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.785
And nothing that happens
after that will ever be the same.

52:46.705 --> 52:49.083
You'll never have to fight again, Helle.

52:50.959 --> 52:51.835
You're safe here.

52:53.629 --> 52:54.471
Safe with us.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.020
Safe with me.

53:06.392 --> 53:08.434
I don't need protecting.

53:09.895 --> 53:10.737
I know.

53:12.564 --> 53:14.407
But maybe you could pretend?

53:18.821 --> 53:19.663
For me.

53:23.701 --> 53:24.543
Sometimes,

53:26.578 --> 53:28.330
I want to pretend I'm someone else.

53:33.293 --> 53:34.886
When I look at you,

53:36.296 --> 53:37.889
I think I could be.

53:58.777 --> 53:59.619
Hello, friends.

54:04.366 --> 54:08.080
If it's food you want, we've plenty to share.

54:08.120 --> 54:08.962
Drink, too.

54:11.832 --> 54:13.505
You can join us if you like.

54:15.794 --> 54:17.256
Helle, no!

54:39.568 --> 54:41.779
- Helle, no!
- Let me go!

54:42.905 --> 54:43.747
Don't kill!

54:45.199 --> 54:46.075
Let me go!

54:47.201 --> 54:49.163
You don't understand, they'll be back!

54:49.203 --> 54:51.752
And they'll bring a whole army
to slaughter us all.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.592
Let them come back.

54:57.669 --> 54:58.591
We'll be long gone.

55:03.050 --> 55:04.058
And so will you.

55:08.806 --> 55:10.649
You're a traveler now.

56:05.696 --> 56:07.494
Now you shall entertain me.

56:52.326 --> 56:54.790
You know, the supplies are running low.

56:54.830 --> 56:57.249
There's very little food left.

56:57.289 --> 56:58.458
I do.

56:58.498 --> 57:01.468
Then shouldn't you be off
raping and pillaging?

57:02.502 --> 57:03.510
We have livestock, do we not?

57:03.550 --> 57:05.388
No, the pigs are all gone.

57:06.548 --> 57:09.928
Surely you don't expect us to eat the horses.

57:11.261 --> 57:14.567
King, of course we won't eat our horses.

57:14.607 --> 57:17.397
What kind of monsters do you take us for?

57:18.894 --> 57:20.521
We will eat your women.

57:22.731 --> 57:23.698
You have enough.

57:25.150 --> 57:29.363
We start with those too old
to still flower and work backwards.

57:33.116 --> 57:36.791
You dream of all you will do
when you achieve true power,

57:38.914 --> 57:40.791
but that dream is a nightmare.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.047
Because to achieve power,

57:45.087 --> 57:49.259
you have already done
all that which you have dreamed of.

57:51.009 --> 57:53.353
So what is left but emptiness?

57:55.973 --> 57:58.146
What else did you expect?

58:00.852 --> 58:01.694
A little

58:02.980 --> 58:03.822
more.

58:05.107 --> 58:06.984
Is it more you crave?

58:09.319 --> 58:10.656
Or is it her?

58:13.365 --> 58:15.288
You know she is out there.

58:16.743 --> 58:20.213
And you know that you will never
be truly powerful

58:21.748 --> 58:23.591
until she is in Valhalla!

58:36.847 --> 58:38.105
Do we have enough men?

58:38.145 --> 58:40.188
More than enough for one girl.

58:48.817 --> 58:49.659
Faster!

58:57.617 --> 58:58.787
We found her.

58:58.827 --> 59:00.998
And she's not alone.

59:01.038 --> 59:02.210
Be ready for a fight!

59:32.486 --> 59:34.989
We ask the forest for her blessing,

59:36.239 --> 59:38.326
that these two children

59:38.366 --> 59:40.835
should be granted the joy and peace

59:41.703 --> 59:44.923
to live their lives
from this day until the end.

59:46.708 --> 59:47.878
As one.

01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:15.912
They made a promise
to each other as children.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:21.126
The promise he would have kept
happily had he not met you.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.496
It's not fair.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.668
And breaking her heart would be?

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:35.424
Some of us are doomed to love
those who cannot love us back.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:39.098
If we can survive that,
we can survive anything.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:43.349
When the heart breaks,
the soul is strengthened

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:46.150
if we are brave enough to let it.

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:48.687
And you are brave, Helle.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:51.358
This won't kill you.

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:52.570
It'll make you stronger.

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:55.944
And that strength won't come
from another man.

01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:59.330
That strength will come from within.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.835
Show yourselves.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:20.929
Helle!

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:24.731
Daughter of Asmund.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:33.816
One and only true heir
to the kingdom of Volsung.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:41.584
We kneel before you,
and offer our lives in service

01:01:41.624 --> 01:01:44.663
as we did your father
and his father before him.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.642
You knew he was my father?

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:09.067
Always.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:15.149
But I kept his promise.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:18.614
As is my duty, but I can keep it no longer.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:22.539
Nor would my king want me to.

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:27.043
And Bard?

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.716
It's as if he's been possessed
by Loki himself.

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:37.007
Whatever Volsung blood lived within his veins

01:02:37.047 --> 01:02:39.093
was surely killed by the Sickling within.

01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:45.137
What you see before you
is all that is free of Volsung.

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:48.314
We fled.

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:51.734
With one hope in our hearts.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.773
That we would one day find our queen,

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:59.526
and together take back
what is rightfully yours.

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:03.371
My Lord Soini,

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:06.207
you flatter me.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:13.172
Remember I said I would
one day ask a favor of you.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.755
This is that favor.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.722
I came here not to flatter my queen.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.762
I came here to fulfill your destiny.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:59.254
The fool is awake all night

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.798
thinking only of problems.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:05.010
When the morning comes,
the fool is tired out,

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.927
and the trouble is just as it was.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:11.725
If you try to run from your destiny,

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.483
you will find only death.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:17.859
And if I take this battle
will I not find death, too?

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:20.982
And not just my own but all of theirs?

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:26.659
To not try, to give up,
that will kill these proud men of yours.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:30.992
It's good here.

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:33.662
It's another way.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:35.671
It is.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.507
But not for you.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.044
You are a leader.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:45.131
Leaders give, not take.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:50.142
You must take what you have
learned back to your people.

01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:52.476
Share the wisdom
so their lives can be better.

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:56.230
That is your destiny, daughter of Asmund,

01:04:57.185 --> 01:05:00.280
the one true heir to the kingdom of Volsung.

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:05.570
Grain by grain, a loaf.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.487
Stone by stone, a castle.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:11.451
Warrior by warrior, a kingdom.

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:23.215
Who is she talking to?

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.510
They say the viking gods

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:27.265
talk to their kings and queens.

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:30.059
She was talking to a god?

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:33.146
Let's hope so, for all our sakes.

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:37.900
Lord Soini.

01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:43.358
Tell your men your prayers
have been answered.

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:44.274
We'll fight.

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:49.242
They're your men, my queen, as am I.

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:51.616
Loyal to the death.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.832
I fear I may have to hold you to that.

01:05:53.872 --> 01:05:55.790
We are outnumbered, it is true.

01:05:57.162 --> 01:06:00.083
But every Volsung is worth a dozen Sickling,

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:02.421
and as we fight for you,
we fight for Volsung.

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:06.512
And the freedom of our wives
and children will make us stronger.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.599
And we will fight with you.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.429
No.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:14.639
Your enemy is our enemy,

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:17.687
and we will not be safe
until they are defeated.

01:06:17.727 --> 01:06:19.192
We fight with you, Helle.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:23.822
I've fought before.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:27.533
Our children have never seen war,
but we elders have.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:30.989
I know what awaits on the battlefield.

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.531
I have seen those sights.

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:34.828
They cannot be unseen.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:39.837
They love you.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.043
They won't say it, and neither will you.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:44.925
Say what?

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.840
The forest is not a home.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.882
In your heart, you know that.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.143
They want one.

01:06:57.055 --> 01:06:59.524
Every man, every woman needs a home.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:03.566
To wander, forever lost, it is not right.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.489
I can give you a home.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.863
Together, with my lands and your ways,

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:14.031
we can build a new and greater kingdom.

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:17.830
The greatest the world has ever known.

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:25.418
Is this what you want?

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:26.550
You know the answer.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.382
You need not ask.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.674
We have been free,

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:36.682
we are free because we are one.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:40.765
If this is what we as one want,

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:44.186
then I will fight for it to my dying breath.

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:52.403
Bard.

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:28.528
We will not all live to see tomorrow.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.783
But know this, if you die,

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:37.666
you will be spoken of as those in the sky.

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:42.078
Like stars.

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.425
Because we are

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:50.801
the light.

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.538
Go.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:49.420
Kill him.

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.558
Togrimm, Ulf!

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:13.646
With your queen.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.835
My brother was paid for your death.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:41.960
I will kill you in this life

01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:45.217
so he can kill you in Valhalla

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:50.472
over and over again.

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:06.938
Hello, my curse.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:11.025
Do you really think you can kill the man
who raised you as his own?

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:15.739
You have that within you?

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.707
You stole me from my true father.

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.874
You slaughtered him like the coward you are.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:30.798
Now fear the reckoning
of those you have wronged.

01:16:49.814 --> 01:16:52.276
You promised me the kingdom.

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:53.112
I did.

01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:57.029
But for how long?

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:15.508
You can't rule.

01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:16.390
You follow.

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:20.763
And you will follow Asmund to your death.

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:24.391
Did you dare dream you would defeat me?

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:25.518
Then what?

01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:29.063
You would rule as queen?

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.524
You, a woman?

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:34.860
The gods would never allow it!

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:23.248
I am Helle.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:25.750
Daughter of Asmund.

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:29.549
The one and only true heir
to the kingdom of Volsung.

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:32.132
Maybe the gods can stop me,

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:37.631
but no man will!

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:54.127
We will not all live to see tomorrow.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:19:59.299
But know this,

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:02.260
if you die,

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.389
you will be spoken of as those in the sky.

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:09.351
Like stars.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:13.942
No!

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:16.580
Our queen.

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:20.000
Our queen.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:24.091
Our queen.

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:27.760
- Our queen.
- Our queen.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.470
Our queen!

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:32.145
Our queen! Our queen!

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:37.276
Our queen! Our queen!

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:41.300
Our queen! Our queen!

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:44.456
Our queen! Our queen!

01:21:44.536 --> 01:21:47.837
Our queen! Our queen!

01:21:47.917 --> 01:21:51.341
Our queen! Our queen!

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:55.537
Our queen! Our queen! Our queen...

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.335
A worm should find no joy in a bird's song.

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:43.758
Tell me, sister.

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:45.840
How do you love a queen

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.510
who lays down with your husband?

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:58.851
Yes, it is a curse

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:02.980
for a child to be born with an absent father.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:24.545
# I have wings that take me
further than me feet #

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:29.834
# Further than the road that carried me #

01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:32.254
# Now I'm on my way #

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:35.757
# Finally, I'm free #

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:40.803
# Watch me fly through
the colors on the breeze #

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:46.309
# I have fought through
the trenches of my mind #

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:51.397
# I have prevailed through
the darkest night #

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:56.819
# Deep in the forest
when the wolf will hear my cry #

01:25:57.319 --> 01:26:02.325
# Down on my knees praying
to the midnight sky #

01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:06.079
# Stay #

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:09.166
# Strong #

01:26:09.206 --> 01:26:14.129
# Hold on #

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:19.175
# With the blackest tears behind my eyes #

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:24.514
# I have fought myself so many times #

01:26:24.971 --> 01:26:29.943
# Now it's my turn, now my time to rise #

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:32.731
# I see the light #

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:36.443
# Still see the light #

01:26:36.483 --> 01:26:38.320
# Stay #

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.074
# Be strong #

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:47.120
# Hold on #

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:49.709

01:27:30.537 --> 01:27:35.543
# In your darkest hour,
the truth will be your light #

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:38.255
# How will we rise or fall #

01:27:38.295 --> 01:27:43.301
# Into the night #

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:49.599
# Night #

01:27:52.851 --> 01:27:54.688
# Stay #

01:27:54.728 --> 01:27:58.400
# Be strong #

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:03.446

the truth will be your light #

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:54.748
# How will we rise or fall #

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:59.794
# Into the night #

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:06.092
# Night #

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:12.516
