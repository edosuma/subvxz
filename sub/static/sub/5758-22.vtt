WEBVTT

00:00.396 --> 00:02.271
Either you shut Hanna up, or I will!

00:02.893 --> 00:04.657
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.

00:05.411 --> 00:07.885
I drove by the accident on my way home.

00:08.127 --> 00:09.342
His car was gone.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.480
Told you it would sink.

00:10.481 --> 00:12.247
Malcolm, this is Aria.

00:12.248 --> 00:13.320
Nice to meet you.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.468
It is so nice to meet you too, Malcolm.

00:15.469 --> 00:17.910
Am I just crazy to think
that this could work?

00:17.911 --> 00:19.072
Toby is "a."

00:21.079 --> 00:22.172
Who's "E. Lamb"?

00:22.173 --> 00:24.557
That's what Toby called himself
to get in and out of Radley.

00:26.715 --> 00:28.884
So, what does this mean? Is Toby dead?

00:28.885 --> 00:30.822
Maybe he just wants us
to think that he's dead.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.261
Either way, Spencer needs
to know about this.

00:32.262 --> 00:33.378
Where is Spencer?

00:54.897 --> 00:56.626
I was hoping she'd be here, but she isn't.

00:56.674 --> 00:58.964
Do you think Spencer just
didn't get your S.O.S.?

00:59.095 --> 01:00.760
Maybe, but she must have
gotten one of the other

01:00.761 --> 01:01.998
twelve messages we sent.

01:01.999 --> 01:04.110
Okay, you guys, she has
ditched school before.

01:04.319 --> 01:05.678
All right? It's not a big deal.

01:05.741 --> 01:07.101
Yeah, you're right, I guess.

01:07.138 --> 01:08.833
Okay, we just need to get through today.

01:08.834 --> 01:10.168
If she doesn't call or show up,

01:10.169 --> 01:11.606
we'll go to her house after school.

01:17.194 --> 01:19.273
Girls, good, you're all together.

01:19.511 --> 01:21.916
I think you know Spencer's
sister, Melissa...

01:21.917 --> 01:24.112
Have you seen Spencer?
Have you talked to her?

01:25.351 --> 01:26.394
Not today.

01:26.502 --> 01:27.666
Is something wrong?

01:27.667 --> 01:29.067
Spencer didn't come home last night.

01:29.068 --> 01:30.109
She's not answering her phone.

01:30.110 --> 01:31.782
I was hoping she was here with you.

01:31.978 --> 01:34.058
Which is why I came here
before I went to the police.

01:34.757 --> 01:35.706
Police?

01:35.707 --> 01:38.475
I understand Spencer's been a
little "distracted" lately.

01:38.476 --> 01:40.697
Was there something on her
mind that she shared with you?

01:40.698 --> 01:41.890
Anything about her plans?

01:42.020 --> 01:43.409
No, Mr. Hackett, um...

01:43.836 --> 01:45.186
She hasn't said anything to us.

01:45.187 --> 01:47.157
You're her friends. She
must have said something.

01:51.554 --> 01:53.961
You can, uh, call the
police from my office.

01:53.962 --> 01:54.977
Thank you.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.596
Let me know if you hear from Spencer.

01:56.946 --> 01:58.053
Yes, sir.

02:08.172 --> 02:09.098
Hello.

02:09.122 --> 02:10.113
Hello.

02:10.752 --> 02:11.901
I'm Eddie.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.158
I'm Jane Doe.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.985
Least that's what it says on my chart.

02:18.234 --> 02:19.580
Hmm. I've met some of your relatives.

02:20.656 --> 02:22.610
I come from a long line of does.

02:24.609 --> 02:26.929
Just gonna check the
dressing on those bandages.

02:27.289 --> 02:28.401
Check away.

02:40.018 --> 02:41.159
What's a three-oh-two?

02:42.558 --> 02:44.205
I heard someone say that's what I am.

02:45.927 --> 02:47.796
It's a law that lets paramedics

02:48.057 --> 02:49.905
send you for a psych evaluation

02:50.365 --> 02:51.824
instead of throwing you in jail.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.933
Mm, lucky me.

02:54.524 --> 02:55.619
You are lucky.

02:57.461 --> 02:59.344
If the county psych ward
hadn't been filled,

02:59.881 --> 03:01.608
you wouldn't have been
diverted here to Radley.

03:02.814 --> 03:04.882
So, this is luxury?

03:05.576 --> 03:07.449
Compared to county, this is Vegas.

03:08.602 --> 03:09.874
What happens next?

03:10.844 --> 03:13.043
You get a doctor visit to evaluate

03:13.830 --> 03:15.086
your mental state.

03:15.708 --> 03:16.947
What's the matter with me?

03:20.032 --> 03:21.235
Just curious.

03:22.627 --> 03:23.461
Well...

03:23.462 --> 03:24.989
You're supposed to have amnesia.

03:26.634 --> 03:27.611
Hmm...

03:29.323 --> 03:31.813
Well, if I do, I certainly
don't remember it.

03:37.476 --> 03:39.036
Try to get you some extra tapioca.

03:39.358 --> 03:40.470
Thanks.

03:40.471 --> 03:41.718
No trouble.

03:52.013 --> 03:53.172
Radley...

04:11.206 --> 04:16.106

<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

04:18.837 --> 04:21.192
Melissa must have the police
looking for Spencer by now.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.843
I do not need more police in my life.

04:23.844 --> 04:25.042
Yeah, none of us do.

04:25.043 --> 04:27.481
Okay, the only thing that counts
right now is finding her.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.479
Now, are you sure that
Spencer didn't say anything

04:29.480 --> 04:30.580
about what she was going to do?

04:30.581 --> 04:32.238
Just that I should stop looking for Toby.

04:33.026 --> 04:33.872
What are we supposed to do,

04:33.873 --> 04:35.657
just sit in our rooms and do our homework?

04:35.658 --> 04:36.531
We look for her.

04:36.532 --> 04:37.808
We look where the police won't look,

04:37.809 --> 04:39.021
because we know her better than them.

04:39.022 --> 04:40.407
Like that bookstore that she likes.

04:40.408 --> 04:42.417
Or that crazy lab theater at Hollis.

04:42.627 --> 04:44.891
We look, we keep talking, and
we check in with Melissa

04:44.892 --> 04:46.185
in case she hears anything.

05:04.446 --> 05:06.412
Mom, you're not gonna find
anything in the paper.

05:06.767 --> 05:08.980
If Wilden took time off,
he's not missing yet.

05:08.981 --> 05:12.982
I just wanna see if anyone's
found anything. Like a body.

05:12.983 --> 05:14.203
"Like" a body?

05:14.204 --> 05:15.318
Or his car.

05:15.319 --> 05:17.385
Hey, well, if they had, there'd
be somebody at the front door

05:17.386 --> 05:19.311
long before you'd read
about it in the paper.

05:21.569 --> 05:22.547
Where is he?

05:22.548 --> 05:24.297
And what the hell does he want?

05:28.633 --> 05:29.687
It's Ted.

05:30.276 --> 05:31.307
Answer it.

05:31.308 --> 05:32.319
I can't.

05:34.688 --> 05:36.472
Ashley Marin's social secretary.

05:37.112 --> 05:38.091
Hi.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.825
Yeah, she's right here,

05:39.826 --> 05:42.229
she just has her hands in some bread dough.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.596
Are you still down for coffee later?

05:44.597 --> 05:46.133
Whispering no! No, no, no!

05:46.181 --> 05:47.350
Absolutely.

05:47.963 --> 05:49.347
Great, I'll tell her.

05:49.908 --> 05:51.355
Okay. Bye.

05:52.931 --> 05:54.105
Why did you do that?

05:54.362 --> 05:55.266
Because.

05:55.810 --> 05:57.439
Nothing is wrong, and...

05:58.489 --> 06:00.203
We have to act like we believe it.

06:04.254 --> 06:05.619
God, I want a pretzel.

06:06.602 --> 06:07.963
Just put some salt on it.

06:28.046 --> 06:29.166
You need some help?

06:30.843 --> 06:32.954
You know what I hate about arithmetic?

06:34.508 --> 06:36.861
You can't charm your way through it.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.729
Well, I'm sure that if
anyone could, it'd be you.

06:42.492 --> 06:44.458
Coffee. Coffee solves everything.

06:50.113 --> 06:51.315
I thought that things were

06:51.316 --> 06:53.121
going okay with the new ghost-writing job.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.461
It was, and then...

06:54.906 --> 06:56.062
Things changed.

06:57.884 --> 06:58.958
Well, do you have a plan?

06:58.959 --> 07:01.534
I need something more than
freelancing, that's for sure.

07:02.613 --> 07:04.470
I was actually thinking
about teaching again.

07:04.471 --> 07:07.025
I liked it. I'm good at it. I'm just...

07:07.264 --> 07:08.344
Not sure.

07:09.214 --> 07:10.749
I know things haven't been fun for you.

07:10.952 --> 07:11.886
Hey...

07:11.961 --> 07:12.899
Look, you're the one who

07:12.900 --> 07:15.416
went from zero to daddy in sixty seconds.

07:17.169 --> 07:18.280
God, I miss you.

07:19.842 --> 07:21.296
Why? I'm right here.

07:21.972 --> 07:23.959
No, I know, but I...

07:23.960 --> 07:25.161
I still miss you.

07:59.053 --> 08:00.161
Spencer...

08:09.114 --> 08:10.882
Olli, olli, oxen free.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.326
Good morning, Ted.

08:17.729 --> 08:18.776
Ashley.

08:19.334 --> 08:20.776
Hey, Hanna. Ashley: Hi.

08:20.777 --> 08:23.058
I thought I'd come along. But
I'll pay for my own coffee.

08:23.098 --> 08:25.660
Don't worry about that, I owe you
both at least a cup of coffee.

08:25.661 --> 08:26.585
Why?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.318
For connecting me with Jamie Doyle.

08:28.393 --> 08:29.605
He's been great.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.092
The steeple's coming along.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.466
Oh, and we should get the bell back

08:32.467 --> 08:33.669
from the foundry tomorrow.

08:33.671 --> 08:34.833
That's wonderful.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.000
Well, let me grab my jacket and we'll go.

08:37.546 --> 08:38.873
Afternoon, padre.

08:41.543 --> 08:42.671
Detective Wilden.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.391
Ashley. Hanna.

08:47.019 --> 08:47.998
Detective...

08:48.092 --> 08:49.823
Looks like you're getting
a lot of work done.

08:50.445 --> 08:51.520
Uh, yes...

08:51.742 --> 08:53.096
Sorry I missed the bell coming down.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.887
I had a couple of days off, went fishing.

08:55.139 --> 08:56.203
Catch anything?

08:56.204 --> 08:58.401
No. But that's the way fishing works.

08:58.402 --> 09:00.326
Sometimes you just have to be patient.

09:00.885 --> 09:02.060
Now it's back to work.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.884
Well, maybe you'll have better luck there.

09:04.218 --> 09:05.324
Maybe...

09:09.162 --> 09:10.247
I'll be just a minute.

09:23.856 --> 09:26.342
They called me to evaluate a "Jane Doe"

09:26.605 --> 09:29.317
the park rangers found
wandering near a camp ground.

09:31.099 --> 09:32.573
Why didn't you tell them who you are?

09:34.008 --> 09:36.919
I lost my bag with my wallet and my phone.

09:38.363 --> 09:39.495
And then I knew what would happen

09:39.496 --> 09:41.623
if I did tell them. So I didn't.

09:43.629 --> 09:46.056
It's been very nice not
being Spencer Hastings.

09:47.602 --> 09:50.214
Even if for only a couple of hours.

09:52.232 --> 09:55.838
What happened in the woods that
made you not want to be Spencer?

10:03.089 --> 10:04.882
Toby Cavanaugh is dead.

10:07.626 --> 10:09.617
I saw his body in the forest.

10:10.917 --> 10:12.323
Somebody killed him.

10:13.004 --> 10:13.797
If this is true...

10:13.798 --> 10:16.232
it is true. I saw it.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.541
Why didn't you tell the park rangers?

10:19.122 --> 10:21.072
Because that wouldn't bring him back.

10:23.154 --> 10:24.379
If someone killed Toby...

10:24.380 --> 10:27.666
somebody did kill Toby, but I
am the reason that he's dead.

10:31.890 --> 10:33.338
I'm gonna call your family,

10:34.046 --> 10:35.906
and then I'm going to call the police.

10:37.122 --> 10:38.296
Do you understand?

10:39.672 --> 10:40.691
Yes.

10:42.413 --> 10:43.473
Okay.

10:44.751 --> 10:46.786
I'll be right back. Stay here.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.512
Where have I got to go?

11:01.582 --> 11:04.426
Dad? Hey, can I talk to you?

11:05.133 --> 11:06.107
Sure.

11:07.195 --> 11:08.893
Dad, I need to talk to you about Ezra.

11:09.491 --> 11:11.004
And he doesn't know that
I'm telling you this,

11:11.005 --> 11:12.348
and I really probably shouldn't...

11:12.349 --> 11:13.409
Aria.

11:13.669 --> 11:17.021
When I talked to your mom,
she told me about Ezra.

11:17.561 --> 11:20.718
About the woman in Delaware. And the boy.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.482
She thought that I should know.

11:24.928 --> 11:26.681
Don't be angry at her for telling me.

11:27.066 --> 11:30.104
I'm not angry at her. Although I should be.

11:32.777 --> 11:34.715
How are you with all of this?

11:34.848 --> 11:35.798
Okay.

11:36.876 --> 11:39.835
Mm, not okay, just... Okay.

11:41.062 --> 11:42.499
Look, that's only one of

11:42.500 --> 11:44.239
the reasons that I needed to talk to you.

11:45.492 --> 11:49.026
Ezra is taking on these
big responsibilities.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.339
And he's just trying to do the right thing.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.985
And it's hard, you know,
he, he needs money.

11:54.836 --> 11:56.057
And he needs a job.

11:57.874 --> 11:58.922
A job.

11:59.047 --> 12:00.174
Teaching.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.348
It's, it's what he knows how to do,

12:02.349 --> 12:04.853
and he'd probably still be
a teacher at Hollis if...

12:05.615 --> 12:07.466
Things had worked out a little different.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.174
Probably.

12:09.624 --> 12:12.306
So, is there something that
you can do about this?

12:16.287 --> 12:17.467
I don't know.

12:18.329 --> 12:21.860
You don't know, or... you don't
know if you're willing to do it?

12:36.100 --> 12:37.357
I talked to mom and dad.

12:37.706 --> 12:39.709
They're trying to get a flight,
but the weather's bad.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.926
Everything is grounded
from London to Spain.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.200
Wow. Spain too.

12:44.326 --> 12:45.929
They'll get here as fast as they can.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.664
Meanwhile, I will try to get you out.

12:48.867 --> 12:50.182
Don't bother.

12:50.335 --> 12:51.575
Don't bother?

12:52.269 --> 12:54.426
It's a 72-hour evaluation.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.799
It'll be over by the time they get here.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.248
Spencer, what happened?

13:00.652 --> 13:02.689
How far back do you want me to go?

13:05.405 --> 13:06.376
Right.

13:07.060 --> 13:09.472
I'm on a psych ward, and
you're the one crying.

13:09.847 --> 13:11.559
I'm responsible for you.

13:11.585 --> 13:13.063
It's okay, Melissa.

13:13.064 --> 13:15.682
No, it's not okay, none of this is okay.

13:15.997 --> 13:18.040
Then it's not okay, it's all screwed up.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.354
Does that make you feel better?

13:19.355 --> 13:20.369
Stop it.

13:22.686 --> 13:23.679
I'm sorry.

13:24.198 --> 13:27.965
All this time, I just thought
you were being cruel.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.532
I never thought that you might be...

13:34.010 --> 13:35.059
Unwell.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.332
That's a big relief for both of us.

13:46.294 --> 13:48.426
Melissa wanted me to know
that Spencer was in Radley,

13:48.427 --> 13:50.026
so she came in on her way out there.

13:50.253 --> 13:51.699
Dr. Sullivan called her.

13:52.176 --> 13:53.911
What's Sullivan have to do with this?

13:54.177 --> 13:55.976
Sullivan found Spencer at Radley.

13:56.091 --> 13:57.670
That's where the rangers sent her.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.072
What? Where was she?

13:59.073 --> 14:01.466
Melissa said that Spencer
was in the woods all night.

14:01.857 --> 14:03.034
Wait, she was just wandering

14:03.035 --> 14:04.957
around in the woods? Why?

14:05.056 --> 14:06.147
Was she looking for Toby?

14:06.148 --> 14:07.229
I don't know.

14:07.279 --> 14:08.964
You guys, we have to go there.

14:08.972 --> 14:09.945
We have to talk to her.

14:09.946 --> 14:11.283
Family visits only.

14:11.299 --> 14:13.393
It's some kind of mandatory evaluation.

14:14.284 --> 14:16.212
I don't like the idea of
Melissa being the only one

14:16.213 --> 14:17.304
that's able to get in there.

14:17.305 --> 14:19.957
I know. That's why I left
Dr. Sullivan a message.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.458
Guys...

14:34.883 --> 14:35.910
What am I taking?

14:36.036 --> 14:38.695
Shotgun antibiotics to
knock out any infection.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.374
No tranquilizers, nothing like that?

14:41.877 --> 14:43.598
No, they need to do a mental evaluation.

14:43.934 --> 14:45.614
Can't do that if you're
under the influence.

14:47.365 --> 14:48.530
Down the hatch.

14:59.730 --> 15:00.809
"E. Lamb"?

15:01.566 --> 15:02.640
That's me.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.020
Eddie lamb? Your last name is lamb?

15:05.529 --> 15:07.268
Yep. Somewhere in the past,

15:07.269 --> 15:09.833
I had an ancestor with a
flock up some Mountain.

15:12.228 --> 15:13.392
My shift's over.

15:14.191 --> 15:15.367
Hang in there.

15:15.779 --> 15:17.613
At least you know you're
not Jane Doe anymore.

15:19.313 --> 15:20.926
Night. Night.

15:32.342 --> 15:33.749
Why did they take her to Radley?

15:34.263 --> 15:35.372
We don't know.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.407
They found her at a campsite.

15:37.946 --> 15:40.130
And she's not allowed visitors
because they're doing some sort of

15:40.131 --> 15:41.427
evaluation on her.

15:42.701 --> 15:43.930
I'm canceling New York.

15:45.075 --> 15:46.700
Wait, you're not gonna go to the seminar?

15:47.548 --> 15:48.823
Mom, you have to go.

15:49.099 --> 15:50.676
It's not a good time for this.

15:50.677 --> 15:52.355
It's exactly the right time.

15:52.412 --> 15:54.848
Hanna, it's not just a promotion.

15:54.849 --> 15:57.231
I told you, we'd have to
relocate, move to New York.

15:57.232 --> 15:58.618
Get out of Rosewood. Right.

15:58.644 --> 16:00.565
Which means, get away from Wilden.

16:01.049 --> 16:04.372
It can't be that easy, just leaving.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.381
Well, I'm a big fan of the easy way.

16:07.206 --> 16:09.373
We can't just run away.

16:09.380 --> 16:11.711
Just go to the seminar. Please.

16:12.793 --> 16:14.342
And then we'll decide what to do later.

16:16.582 --> 16:18.827
I don't want you alone in
this house while I'm gone.

16:19.217 --> 16:20.475
I'll just stay at Emily's.

16:21.056 --> 16:22.905
Mom, it's only for a few days.

16:34.816 --> 16:35.922
Dr. Sullivan.

16:37.492 --> 16:38.931
Oh, Emily. How are you?

16:38.941 --> 16:39.777
Okay...

16:39.778 --> 16:41.142
The way we left that last session...

16:41.143 --> 16:42.318
we heard about Spencer.

16:43.321 --> 16:45.180
She's all right. She's safe.

16:45.181 --> 16:46.353
When can we see her?

16:46.656 --> 16:48.408
Not while she's under observation.

16:48.786 --> 16:49.913
What happened to her?

16:49.914 --> 16:51.714
Did she say why she was
out there all alone?

16:52.849 --> 16:55.652
Emily, Spencer said she
saw a body in the woods.

16:56.261 --> 16:57.482
She thought it was Toby.

16:58.162 --> 16:59.433
Oh, God...

16:59.434 --> 17:00.818
The police and the rangers
have been looking,

17:00.819 --> 17:01.946
but they haven't found anything.

17:01.947 --> 17:03.265
Do you think she was lying?

17:04.534 --> 17:08.424
I think Spencer was in an agitated
state when they found her.

17:08.646 --> 17:10.078
I'm not certain what she saw.

17:10.625 --> 17:13.419
The police have been trying
to contact Toby's family,

17:13.502 --> 17:14.833
to find out if he's all right.

17:16.483 --> 17:17.794
Do you know where he is?

17:19.147 --> 17:20.313
No, I don't.

17:27.208 --> 17:29.480
I thought the toughest thing we
were gonna have to deal with

17:29.481 --> 17:31.417
senior year would be her prom dress.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.940
And that is still coming up.

17:32.941 --> 17:33.897
Meanwhile...

17:34.692 --> 17:35.663
Meanwhile...

17:36.554 --> 17:40.386
What are we supposed to do
about Ezra and his situation?

17:41.783 --> 17:43.855
Uh, are we supposed to do anything?

17:44.915 --> 17:46.113
Aria wants us to.

17:46.754 --> 17:47.671
Hmm...

17:47.889 --> 17:50.423
Push comes to shove, and
she goes to her parents.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.487
Yeah, and we're not... useless.

17:52.920 --> 17:53.964
Not yet.

17:55.401 --> 17:58.843
Mm. I'm the one who got him fired.
I could...

17:58.844 --> 17:59.965
Talk to the Dean.

18:00.682 --> 18:01.812
Do you want to?

18:02.367 --> 18:03.693
Well, he is a good teacher.

18:04.319 --> 18:06.824
Other aspects of his
character are debatable,

18:06.825 --> 18:08.447
but yes, he is a good teacher.

18:09.528 --> 18:10.646
Something else.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.205
What?

18:12.851 --> 18:15.956
If we helped him stabilize this new family,

18:16.961 --> 18:18.895
he might end things with Aria.

18:20.798 --> 18:22.190
I suppose that's true.

18:22.614 --> 18:24.659
But is it a reason to help?

18:28.384 --> 18:30.769
No... No...

18:31.697 --> 18:32.933
No, that's not right.

18:33.990 --> 18:35.928
I know what I saw, he's dead.

18:36.257 --> 18:38.736
Spencer, why don't you want to
believe that he could be alive?

18:38.770 --> 18:40.791
Because I know what I saw!

18:41.333 --> 18:43.421
The body, did you see the face?

18:44.885 --> 18:45.892
No!

18:46.412 --> 18:48.341
No, but I know that it was Toby!

18:51.442 --> 18:53.507
Spencer, I think you took a lot

18:53.910 --> 18:55.632
into that forest with you.

19:05.692 --> 19:07.042
I wanna see my friends.

19:08.842 --> 19:10.376
Please, when can I see my friends?

19:11.351 --> 19:14.557
Not during the evaluation. After that...

19:14.639 --> 19:15.846
After that, what?

19:16.401 --> 19:18.013
After that, you'll either be released

19:18.014 --> 19:20.458
or further treatment will be recommended.

19:22.091 --> 19:23.413
I can call Emily,

19:23.757 --> 19:25.261
if you have a message for them.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.527
Just...

19:29.231 --> 19:30.891
Tell them that I miss them.

19:36.290 --> 19:37.553
I'll be back tonight.

19:38.823 --> 19:39.776
Thank you.

19:40.983 --> 19:41.938
Okay...

20:04.962 --> 20:05.953
You made it.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.486
Can't stay long. But,
uh, you wanted to talk?

20:08.893 --> 20:10.419
I wanted you to meet someone.

20:10.662 --> 20:11.722
Hi.

20:12.432 --> 20:14.821
Emily fields, missy Franklin.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.151
Missy, Emily.

20:16.571 --> 20:18.903
So, shana was telling me that you swim?

20:19.124 --> 20:22.428
Hello. Yes. I swim.

20:22.584 --> 20:24.596
I met missy at the airport in Colorado.

20:24.597 --> 20:26.545
No way I wasn't introducing myself.

20:27.248 --> 20:28.594
She's headed for Philadelphia,

20:28.595 --> 20:30.134
I thought it'd be fun if you two met.

20:30.374 --> 20:31.393
Sit down.

20:32.645 --> 20:33.914
What do you want? I'll buy.

20:34.293 --> 20:36.430
Um, g-green tea.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.036
So, does Rosewood have a good program?

20:41.293 --> 20:42.502
Yeah, pretty good.

20:42.572 --> 20:43.867
The sharks, right?

20:43.868 --> 20:45.079
Right, sharks...

20:47.145 --> 20:49.877
Oh, God, um... congratulations.

20:50.571 --> 20:52.458
It's not too late to say
congratulations, is it?

20:52.459 --> 20:55.330
No, it's never too late to say
congratulations. Thank you.

20:58.860 --> 21:00.585
You ever lose one of those badges?

21:02.327 --> 21:03.976
Not if you want to keep your job.

21:05.065 --> 21:06.502
They have a chip, right?

21:06.876 --> 21:08.702
That's how they work with
the doors and stuff?

21:09.166 --> 21:12.024
You're asking the kind of
questions I'm supposed to report.

21:12.363 --> 21:13.621
I'm just curious.

21:15.935 --> 21:17.409
Seventy-two hours.

21:18.166 --> 21:18.909
That's not long.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.381
You can do that standing on your head.
Then you're out.

21:25.376 --> 21:27.073
What if I really am crazy?

21:27.447 --> 21:28.520
You're not crazy.

21:33.635 --> 21:36.119
There was some trouble with the old badges.

21:36.912 --> 21:38.259
They had to change the whole system.

21:38.260 --> 21:39.216
What kind of trouble?

21:39.748 --> 21:40.882
What kind do you think?

21:41.174 --> 21:44.211
People getting out? People getting in?

21:47.861 --> 21:49.791
You want tapioca or vanilla tonight?

21:51.200 --> 21:52.446
Surprise me.

22:02.433 --> 22:04.782
I can't stop thinking about
Spencer in that place.

22:04.783 --> 22:05.973
We'll get her out.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.148
Shouldn't we have seen it coming?

22:08.149 --> 22:10.652
Okay, I have to split
myself between disasters.

22:10.653 --> 22:12.556
It's after three, so I'm
thinking about my mom.

22:12.825 --> 22:15.165
Hey, if Wilden wants to
come after you, he will.

22:15.586 --> 22:17.558
It's not like New York is
in some other country.

22:17.812 --> 22:19.578
New York is on another planet.

22:20.332 --> 22:22.027
I don't know if she'll get the job, but...

22:22.028 --> 22:24.517
I want her to have the option
in case things get worse.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.321
So, what did Wilden tell
people about his car?

22:27.322 --> 22:29.170
Emily said he reported it stolen.

22:29.171 --> 22:30.150
Don't you think they'll find it?

22:30.151 --> 22:32.091
I mean, don't all cop cars have GPS?

22:32.092 --> 22:33.734
No, it doesn't work under water.

22:33.735 --> 22:34.468
It doesn't?

22:34.469 --> 22:36.978
Nothing works underwater,
it's a scientific fact.

22:39.304 --> 22:41.007
You actually think you'll go to New York?

22:41.008 --> 22:43.647
If it's to keep my mom
safe from Wilden, then...

22:44.274 --> 22:45.944
I'll make the sacrifice.

22:45.945 --> 22:48.640
Yeah, I... Hear it's awful
primitive out there.

22:50.398 --> 22:51.685
Say cheese!

22:53.255 --> 22:54.543
Let me take one of you two.

22:59.198 --> 22:59.936
Great.

23:00.608 --> 23:03.418
I have to get going, but send
me the video of your meet.

23:03.419 --> 23:04.613
I will. And I'm gonna try

23:04.614 --> 23:06.071
what you said about the cross-over turn.

23:06.072 --> 23:08.689
It works for me. Bye, shana. Bye, Emily

23:08.690 --> 23:09.506
bye. Bye.

23:12.346 --> 23:14.165
I didn't know you swim.

23:14.166 --> 23:15.267
Paige didn't tell you?

23:15.613 --> 23:16.271
No.

23:17.065 --> 23:18.653
Wonder why she never mentioned it.

23:20.239 --> 23:21.941
Don't forget to send me those pictures.

23:21.942 --> 23:22.830
You've got my e-mail.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.548
What makes you think
this kid stole my I.D.?

23:32.549 --> 23:35.863
Because I saw it. I saw your I.D.
with his picture.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.835
W-what would he need it for?

23:39.294 --> 23:40.698
To see somebody in here.

23:40.699 --> 23:42.605
Somebody that he couldn't
just visit because...

23:43.249 --> 23:45.016
He was doing things for her.

23:45.638 --> 23:46.875
Out in the world.

23:47.380 --> 23:48.055
She?

23:48.377 --> 23:50.170
Yeah, the patient's name
was Mona Vanderwaal.

23:50.171 --> 23:51.213
Do you remember her?

23:52.969 --> 23:54.108
She's hard to forget.

23:54.584 --> 23:55.719
And the boy.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.223
His real name was Toby.

24:06.801 --> 24:07.955
You haven't touched your pudding.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.969
Saving it for later.

24:10.350 --> 24:13.217
Delayed gratification. Shows discipline.
Patience.

24:13.218 --> 24:14.798
I'm not so patient.

24:18.172 --> 24:19.501
Wasn't just the badges.

24:20.189 --> 24:22.248
They had a problem with
the visitors' passes.

24:22.278 --> 24:24.009
They traced it back to
someone on the staff.

24:24.010 --> 24:25.137
Who? Who was it?

24:25.138 --> 24:26.343
I like my job.

24:26.912 --> 24:28.931
I've been here since I got out of the Navy.

24:28.932 --> 24:30.424
One of the ways that you keep your job

24:30.425 --> 24:32.061
is by keeping your mouth shut.

24:32.062 --> 24:34.823
Eddie. It seems like we're a
little bit past that point.

24:35.420 --> 24:38.060
Maybe. Maybe not.

24:43.676 --> 24:44.567
She was here.

24:45.898 --> 24:46.931
Mona Vanderwaal.

24:49.708 --> 24:50.796
This was her room.

okay, what do you suppose loser
Mona was doing in there?

25:58.971 --> 26:00.372
Praying for bigger boobs?

26:00.688 --> 26:02.831
Why do you even bother going to church?

26:02.832 --> 26:04.416
I like to cover my bets.

26:17.270 --> 26:18.297
What is that?

26:18.683 --> 26:20.699
You were writing in it all during service.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.229
It's my diary.

26:22.230 --> 26:23.803
Since when do you keep a diary?

26:24.394 --> 26:25.624
Since forever.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.407
Let me see.

26:27.781 --> 26:28.531
Okay.

26:29.051 --> 26:31.038
No, you're gonna have to wait till after.

26:31.039 --> 26:32.275
Till after what?

26:32.276 --> 26:33.458
After I'm dead.

26:33.459 --> 26:34.778
Ew, don't be so gruesome!

26:34.779 --> 26:37.846
I'm not being gruesome,
I'm being mysterious.

26:38.505 --> 26:41.245
Forget it. I don't want to read
your stupid diary, anyway.

26:41.645 --> 26:42.447
Yes, you do.

26:43.167 --> 26:44.544
I'm writing them for you.

26:45.165 --> 26:46.057
"Them"?

26:46.404 --> 26:48.173
They're beyond scandalous.

26:48.174 --> 26:48.845
You're gonna need them

26:48.846 --> 26:50.714
if you're gonna carry on after I'm gone.

26:50.715 --> 26:52.258
Carry on with what?

26:53.937 --> 26:56.573
Fresh muffins at the bakery. Come on!

27:13.800 --> 27:14.497
Here you go.

27:15.626 --> 27:16.293
Thank you.

27:16.631 --> 27:17.587
Please, have a seat.

27:29.585 --> 27:33.018
I didn't send her to ask for any favors.

27:33.019 --> 27:33.911
No, I know that.

27:33.912 --> 27:37.375
I-I didn't swear her to secrecy
about what's going on,

27:37.376 --> 27:40.725
but I never told her to ask for help.

27:41.751 --> 27:43.909
I don't want you or Ella to
think that I would do that.

27:43.910 --> 27:45.656
W-we know that you didn't.

27:45.657 --> 27:47.551
And I'm sorry she put you in that position.

27:47.552 --> 27:50.220
Oh, don't be angry at Aria.
She wanted to help.

27:50.221 --> 27:52.952
Oh, no, I-I'm not angry
with her, I couldn't be.

27:53.299 --> 27:55.167
There are just things about this situation

27:55.168 --> 27:57.862
that I haven't been able to explain to her.

27:58.535 --> 28:01.678
Well. Pride is a tricky thing.

28:05.819 --> 28:07.401
Why did you come here today?

28:09.124 --> 28:10.129
I talked to the Dean.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.831
I wanted to see if there was room

28:12.832 --> 28:14.544
in the department for you.

28:15.230 --> 28:17.981
And, uh, I'm afraid that there isn't.

28:19.588 --> 28:21.879
But I still want to help you, if I can.

28:22.251 --> 28:23.004
Because?

28:24.753 --> 28:26.324
Could just be habit.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.321
I have reached a point in my life

28:30.322 --> 28:32.296
where I spend a great deal of time

28:32.297 --> 28:34.241
trying to make some kind of amends

28:34.242 --> 28:37.057
to someone for... Something.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.469
There's no shortage of bad
judgment in this world.

28:47.830 --> 28:49.093
Tell me about your son.

29:05.655 --> 29:07.464
You got all kinds of secret talents.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.299
I don't play so much anymore.

29:11.919 --> 29:14.809
My sister and I used to
play four-handed pieces.

29:15.551 --> 29:17.200
But that was a long time ago.

29:22.223 --> 29:24.165
Toby's not a name you hear everyday.

29:25.815 --> 29:27.354
No, it's not.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.959
I've known one Toby in my life.

29:32.805 --> 29:33.584
Nice kid.

29:35.430 --> 29:37.414
I met him when his mother
was a patient here.

29:41.813 --> 29:45.600
My Toby's name was Cavanaugh.
What about yours?

29:46.297 --> 29:49.056
Be a hell of a coincidence if it
was the same Toby, wouldn't it?

29:49.057 --> 29:50.307
Yes, it would.

29:51.741 --> 29:53.437
Do you believe in coincidences?

29:54.548 --> 29:56.001
Not as much as I used to.

29:57.529 --> 29:58.295
Excuse me...

30:00.005 --> 30:02.845
Hi there. What's the
number on file for the...

30:05.584 --> 30:06.509
Keep practicing.

30:08.799 --> 30:10.696
Woman at desk: Just a minute,
and I'll get it for you.

30:12.435 --> 30:14.538
We could just say that
we're Spencer's cousins.

30:14.539 --> 30:16.721
Hanna, nobody's ever gonna believe that.

30:17.032 --> 30:17.599
We have to find out

30:17.600 --> 30:19.384
why she's so sure Toby's dead.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.595
Well, they have to let
her out after 72 hours.

30:21.596 --> 30:24.318
No, they don't have to let her
go at all if she's really...

30:25.186 --> 30:25.869
You know...

30:26.636 --> 30:27.773
What are you saying?

30:27.774 --> 30:29.832
I'm saying, "A's" been
turning the screws so long,

30:29.833 --> 30:31.688
one of us was bound to snap a string.

30:32.156 --> 30:33.846
Just never thought that
it would be Spencer.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.226
I did.

30:36.179 --> 30:37.182
Why?

30:37.183 --> 30:39.561
Because there's a downside
to being too smart.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.777
You were never the weak link, Emily.

30:44.215 --> 30:45.160
Spencer was.

30:58.202 --> 31:00.953
So, where's the fourth musketeer?

31:01.299 --> 31:02.845
Haven't seen her today.

31:02.846 --> 31:04.232
If you mean Spencer,

31:04.692 --> 31:07.172
I think you know exactly where
she is, she's in Radley,

31:07.173 --> 31:08.363
and you're the reason why.

31:10.011 --> 31:10.894
Radley?

31:11.753 --> 31:13.713
Don't play dumb, Mona.

31:13.714 --> 31:15.730
Could've gotten through senior
year and been finished,

31:15.731 --> 31:17.141
but you wouldn't leave it alone.

31:17.782 --> 31:18.595
Listen to me...

31:18.596 --> 31:20.152
no, you listen.

31:20.153 --> 31:22.296
If Spencer doesn't get better, and
she doesn't get out of Radley,

31:22.297 --> 31:23.472
you're gonna wish you broke your neck

31:23.473 --> 31:24.829
when you fell off that cliff.

31:25.366 --> 31:26.389
Woman on P.A.: Attention...

31:26.390 --> 31:29.491
Aria Montgomery, report to
the principal's office.

31:29.492 --> 31:31.701
Aria Montgomery, to the office.

31:43.285 --> 31:46.440
This is completely informal conversation.

31:47.616 --> 31:49.670
I want to make sure that we avoid any...

31:49.671 --> 31:52.850
Misunderstandings or miscommunications.

31:54.030 --> 31:54.801
Okay...

31:56.296 --> 31:59.405
Ezra Fitz has applied
to the school district

31:59.406 --> 32:00.717
as a substitute teacher.

32:01.775 --> 32:03.805
If his application is approved,

32:04.428 --> 32:06.629
he will probably, at some point,

32:06.630 --> 32:09.357
be assigned to cover a class here.

32:10.747 --> 32:12.499
It's come to my attention that...

32:13.169 --> 32:15.827
Since Mr. Fitz left Rosewood high,

32:15.828 --> 32:16.796
you have seen him.

32:17.486 --> 32:18.481
Occasionally.

32:20.049 --> 32:21.523
In a social context.

32:23.010 --> 32:23.850
Yes...

32:25.211 --> 32:27.233
The school has no interest in the...

32:27.234 --> 32:28.840
Personal lives of pupils.

32:29.815 --> 32:31.868
But under the... unusual circumstances,

32:31.869 --> 32:33.491
I feel that I have to ask.

32:34.283 --> 32:36.722
Are you currently seeing Ezra Fitz?

32:37.744 --> 32:39.079
Seeing him socially?

32:40.749 --> 32:41.786
No, I'm not.

32:43.282 --> 32:44.830
I-I saw him...

32:44.831 --> 32:48.655
After he left Rosewood high.
Socially. A few times.

32:49.157 --> 32:53.417
Um, I suppose it might have looked
like something that it wasn't.

32:53.418 --> 32:55.122
Which it wasn't.

32:55.615 --> 32:57.691
There was never any question of it...

32:58.193 --> 32:59.521
Being anything serious.

33:00.490 --> 33:02.897
I'm glad you both realized
that before things...

33:03.615 --> 33:04.672
Went too far.

33:04.673 --> 33:08.239
Yeah. It's definitely a good thing.

33:09.227 --> 33:11.099
Otherwise, it might have been a little...

33:11.685 --> 33:12.330
Awkward?

33:12.331 --> 33:15.099
Yes. Very awkward.

33:16.059 --> 33:18.334
I'm sorry if this was
embarrassing, but, uh...

33:19.126 --> 33:21.066
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask.

33:21.322 --> 33:23.259
No, I'm glad that I could
clear things up for you.

33:24.008 --> 33:24.868
And you have.

33:25.276 --> 33:26.000
Good.

33:42.171 --> 33:43.511
Small world, isn't it?

33:49.642 --> 33:50.882
Well, they call it training,

33:50.883 --> 33:53.147
but it's more of an assessment.

33:53.148 --> 33:54.750
To see if you can do the job.

33:55.457 --> 33:57.840
I'm sorry to cancel so late, but...

33:57.841 --> 34:00.109
The bank only does this twice a year.

34:00.110 --> 34:02.834
Nah, that's okay. It's, it's important.

34:03.152 --> 34:03.843
Yeah.

34:04.648 --> 34:06.667
And I'll only be gone a couple of days...

34:07.362 --> 34:08.141
This time.

34:09.112 --> 34:09.989
This time?

34:10.261 --> 34:11.264
Yeah, if it works out,

34:11.264 --> 34:13.949
I will be... taking Hanna
to New York with me.

34:14.821 --> 34:16.900
So the promotion wouldn't be here.

34:16.902 --> 34:18.668
No, it's in New York.

34:20.761 --> 34:23.848
Well... When would you go,
if they offer it to you?

34:25.728 --> 34:27.617
I'd have to make the
decision pretty quickly.

34:29.489 --> 34:30.895
Miss the great unveiling...

34:32.993 --> 34:34.027
We can come back for that.

34:35.594 --> 34:36.268
Well...

34:37.422 --> 34:38.779
I should wish you luck.

34:39.946 --> 34:41.485
But I don't think I can right now.

34:43.199 --> 34:44.379
Wouldn't feel honest.

34:47.344 --> 34:48.578
I like seeing you.

34:49.780 --> 34:50.735
Right here.

34:52.446 --> 34:53.465
I like seeing you.

34:59.410 --> 35:00.851
If there was some other reason.

35:01.839 --> 35:03.744
For you leaving, besides the promotion...

35:04.839 --> 35:06.077
Would you tell me about it?

35:07.382 --> 35:08.767
This is the only reason.

35:09.279 --> 35:12.443
"If." Would you tell me?

35:13.401 --> 35:15.355
Because maybe I could
do something about it.

35:15.356 --> 35:18.543
I'd like to try. If you'd want me to.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.745
There's nothing you have to worry about.

35:34.689 --> 35:36.362
Are you sure you don't want a cookie?

35:36.971 --> 35:39.398
No. Thank you.

35:40.267 --> 35:41.009
Okay.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.049
I brought them for Sybil.

35:44.805 --> 35:48.015
She was my favorite nurse. Very kind.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.742
It's important to reward kindness.

35:53.454 --> 35:55.370
I bet you were surprised to see me.

35:55.371 --> 35:56.975
You're taking a big risk.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.945
Coming here. Talking to me.

36:01.497 --> 36:03.208
Just visiting a friend.

36:03.933 --> 36:05.662
Why did you kill Toby?

36:07.639 --> 36:08.919
What did that get you?

36:10.262 --> 36:12.551
That's an interesting question.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.360
If it were true, if I killed him,

36:16.361 --> 36:17.973
why would I want to talk to you?

36:21.313 --> 36:23.803
Look at all that's happened
since you turned me down

36:23.804 --> 36:25.771
on our little drive up the Mountain.

36:26.541 --> 36:29.134
All the pain and disappointment and loss,

36:29.135 --> 36:30.952
because you were stubborn.

36:32.725 --> 36:36.587
But I believe in second chances.
I'm a generous person.

36:36.588 --> 36:37.750
No, you're not.

36:38.709 --> 36:40.551
You wouldn't be here if you
didn't need something.

36:40.552 --> 36:42.303
Whatever it is, Mona, the answer's no.

36:42.304 --> 36:43.735
Ali was never pregnant.

36:45.086 --> 36:47.903
She thought she was, and she
panicked, but it was a false alarm.

36:48.552 --> 36:49.810
No way you can be sure of that.

36:49.811 --> 36:50.781
Ali told me.

36:52.911 --> 36:56.074
I have her diaries. Remember?

36:57.273 --> 36:59.613
I don't have all of them, but...

37:00.520 --> 37:02.030
I have most of them.

37:02.031 --> 37:04.011
And I know where the rest of them are.

37:08.653 --> 37:10.391
I have the answers, Spencer.

37:10.966 --> 37:14.585
I have the answers to questions
you haven't even thought of.

37:16.295 --> 37:17.394
Leave me alone.

37:25.706 --> 37:29.606
You have all these bits and pieces.

37:30.426 --> 37:32.455
You're trying to put
together a jig-saw puzzle,

37:32.456 --> 37:36.018
but you've never seen the picture
on the front of the box.

37:36.609 --> 37:37.708
You need me.

37:38.546 --> 37:41.496
Otherwise, you'll never really
know anything for sure.

37:41.960 --> 37:42.911
Go away!

37:43.635 --> 37:45.529
Before I start choking you again.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.304
Mona, I've got nothing left to lose.

37:49.908 --> 37:51.432
They already think that I'm crazy.

37:56.749 --> 37:57.855
You're not crazy.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.040
You're as sane as I am.

38:11.751 --> 38:13.545
Your mom should have the contact info.

38:14.531 --> 38:16.656
I will call you as soon I get to the hotel.

38:16.783 --> 38:17.503
Okay.

38:17.983 --> 38:20.007
Don't worry, mom. I'll be fine,

38:20.008 --> 38:21.418
we'll be okay, Mrs. marin.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.799
I love you. I love you.

38:27.926 --> 38:30.712
Geez, did you pack enough for three days?

38:30.713 --> 38:32.269
If I forgot something,
I can always go back.

38:42.433 --> 38:43.350
Ignore him.

38:48.229 --> 38:49.687
Hanna, you don't have to talk to him.

38:49.688 --> 38:50.569
You know what, Emily?

38:51.044 --> 38:52.800
Sometimes you poke the bear,

38:52.801 --> 38:54.470
and other times, the bear pokes you.

38:55.921 --> 38:57.202
It's from a movie.

39:03.653 --> 39:04.824
Hello. Hello.

39:05.292 --> 39:08.271
Are you following me? Me and my mom?

39:08.272 --> 39:09.008
Why would I do that?

39:09.009 --> 39:09.824
I don't know.

39:10.796 --> 39:12.081
I'm just wondering if you are.

39:12.566 --> 39:14.291
No, I'm not following you.

39:14.292 --> 39:15.388
Well, then go away.

39:15.389 --> 39:16.422
I went away.

39:16.423 --> 39:18.408
Right. You went fishing.

39:18.409 --> 39:19.162
That's right.

39:19.949 --> 39:21.233
And now I'm back.

39:21.234 --> 39:23.375
And while I was away, I did some thinking.

39:23.377 --> 39:26.621
You, me, and your mother. It's complicated.

39:26.622 --> 39:27.752
I don't think any of us have been

39:27.753 --> 39:30.083
completely honest with
each other about things.

39:30.763 --> 39:32.042
Honesty is tough.

39:32.330 --> 39:34.876
Yeah, but you could make that
easier on everybody, Hanna.

39:34.877 --> 39:36.203
And how could I do that?

39:36.978 --> 39:39.694
The car, Hanna. The car?

39:39.695 --> 39:42.572
Just give me the keys, and
tell me where you left it.

39:43.108 --> 39:44.454
That's all you have to do.

39:45.172 --> 39:47.055
And then there's no more trouble from me.

39:47.767 --> 39:51.374
All I want from you and
your mother is that car.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.187
I knew who I was when they found me.

40:02.405 --> 40:05.288
And I knew that my family and
friends would be worried.

40:06.666 --> 40:07.508
But I just...

40:08.255 --> 40:10.366
I wanted to fold up and stop.

40:11.549 --> 40:13.484
I didn't, I didn't wanna think anymore.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.482
You were overwhelmed.

40:19.606 --> 40:22.473
Yeah, well, I wasn't Spencer Hastings

40:22.474 --> 40:24.016
for almost a whole day, and...

40:24.017 --> 40:26.444
Nobody else showed up
to take the job, so...

40:27.354 --> 40:28.758
Guess I'm stuck with it.

40:29.242 --> 40:32.013
Because you're the only person
in the world that can be you.

40:32.331 --> 40:34.033
You don't have to rub it in.

40:37.052 --> 40:39.158
I'm sorry, this can't be very entertaining.

40:39.507 --> 40:42.068
I mean, there are people
here with real problems.

40:42.837 --> 40:43.984
Just like you.

40:49.275 --> 40:50.520
Yeah, just like me.

40:55.495 --> 40:56.282
I, uh...

40:58.534 --> 41:00.988
I fell down in the woods.

41:02.654 --> 41:03.571
When I was running.

41:04.770 --> 41:07.664
I fell down, and I looked
at the ground, and I...

41:08.404 --> 41:12.633
Saw my hand, and my sleeve, and...

41:12.634 --> 41:14.246
The little button on my sleeve.

41:14.963 --> 41:15.955
And some dirt,

41:16.341 --> 41:18.983
and an old acorn, and I said to myself:

41:20.003 --> 41:23.197
"Okay, if this is the last
thing that you ever see,"

41:25.713 --> 41:26.871
I can handle that.

41:30.098 --> 41:30.983
I'm done.

41:33.425 --> 41:34.668
"I've had enough."

41:36.758 --> 41:38.867
But it wasn't the last thing that I saw.

41:41.752 --> 41:44.233
I just kept going.

41:46.205 --> 41:48.494
How do you keep going

41:48.810 --> 41:51.125
when the worst thing has happened?

41:53.501 --> 41:57.062
What do you have to
change inside to survive?

41:59.089 --> 42:00.496
Who do you have to become?

42:06.625 --> 42:09.246
I'm sorry, I don't expect
you guys to understand.

42:10.087 --> 42:11.032
You don't know me.

42:26.083 --> 42:29.745
I'm sorry, but that's true.

42:35.441 --> 42:37.725
You don't know who I am anymore.

42:44.551 --> 42:46.175
And you can't count on me.
