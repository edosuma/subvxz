(neighs)

02:15.093 --> 02:17.303
(men shouting)

02:25.270 --> 02:28.314
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Bullock.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.192
Sofia:
"Ox, box, fox."

02:31.360 --> 02:33.653
- Mr. Bullock.
- Good morning.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.364
Good morning, Sofia.
Sorry to interrupt your lesson.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.157
We're finished.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.910
No, we're not, Sofia,
and we'll continue downstairs.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.755
Adams: Hills get divided
into three counties.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.174
Each county has a commissioner.

02:55.342 --> 02:59.387
- Al: Appointed by fucking who?
- The governor.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.264
When the fuck does that happen?

03:01.431 --> 03:03.432
It already did.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.812
Anyone I know?

03:07.980 --> 03:10.523
They're all from Yankton.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.070
Well, being as you're the bearer
of unsettling news,

03:16.238 --> 03:18.364
why don't you step the fuck inside?

03:20.284 --> 03:23.160
No one from
the fucking Hills, huh?

03:23.328 --> 03:25.788
All Pennington's people.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.748
Saves time.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.252
Just travel to one destination,
murder the three of them.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.797
See how they like being
commissioner after they're dead.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.970
Coach coming, Lila.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.389
With your friend and her girls?

03:43.557 --> 03:47.059
I don't know.
It's still way up in the hills.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.520
You want me to come
watch with you?

03:49.688 --> 03:50.897
Oh, no no.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.024
Well, okay.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.402
Well, do whatever you want,
but I'll wait outside for you.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.365
All the invoices other than
this mission from Hendy Iron

04:01.533 --> 04:03.409
- have been acted on.
- I see.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.579
You'll note I've made
partial payment to them...

04:06.747 --> 04:08.247
Yes.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.374
...questioning a possible duplication.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.753
- For the bill hooks?
- Yes.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.548
Is that my worth?

04:17.716 --> 04:19.382
That's the amount on deposit.

04:19.551 --> 04:23.262
Your worth is considerably more.

04:26.934 --> 04:31.646
Thank you for your attention
in all these matters, Mr. Bullock.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.481
You're welcome.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.995
He wrote you a letter--

04:48.163 --> 04:50.998
- Pennington.
- That you held from me till now?

04:51.166 --> 04:53.292
To say what I knew first.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.430
Please be seated.

05:21.571 --> 05:25.574
Yes, it has fallen to this.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.827
(sighs)

05:39.548 --> 05:41.549
- AW: Damn.
- (insects buzzing)

05:43.635 --> 05:46.053
EB:
Mr. Ellsworth!

05:46.221 --> 05:50.099
Is the Garret gold in readiness
for shipment to Denver?

05:50.267 --> 05:52.601
- (rhythmic thumping)
- That it is.

05:54.271 --> 05:58.941
I would expect a delay before the owner
blesses its passage.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.153
While little Sofia is off
with her tutor,

06:02.320 --> 06:05.322
Mrs. Garret "consults"
with Mr. Bullock.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.533
All right.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.203
In Bullock's capacity, of course,
as her claim's trustee.

06:13.165 --> 06:17.168
That's all the cleverness on that
subject I'm inclined to hear from you.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.670
(moaning)

06:27.512 --> 06:29.847
Sofia: "Fat. Cat."

06:38.273 --> 06:40.149
Biscuits? Piping fresh.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.027
Yeah, when both of us
was young.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.910
(snorts)

06:51.078 --> 06:53.079
(sighs)

06:54.581 --> 06:56.207
Ah!

06:56.374 --> 06:57.917
Anyways, I could use a bath--

06:58.085 --> 07:01.337
"I urge you, Mr. Swearengen,
not to take as injury to your interests

07:01.505 --> 07:04.965
my appointing only men from Yankton.
For not being of the region,

07:05.133 --> 07:07.051
such men serving as commissioners

07:07.219 --> 07:10.763
I hold less likely to obstruct
those like yourself

07:10.931 --> 07:13.682
who actively pursue
their destinies in the Hills.

07:13.850 --> 07:18.562
In those brave endeavors,
be assured of my best hopes,

07:18.730 --> 07:23.609
high esteem and continued gratitude
for your gestures of support.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.779
Governor Pennington."

07:26.947 --> 07:28.823
Well, that's just the fucking sort--

07:28.990 --> 07:33.160
chop them into pieces, and each
of them happily slithers away,

07:33.328 --> 07:36.956
- still lying to your fucking face.
- What am I to make of this, huh?

07:37.124 --> 07:39.667
He don't know yet
what he wants to do.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.128
Knew what to do with them
fucking bribes I sent.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.255
That's a gift they're born with.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.340
Far as how hard
to move on the camp,

07:46.508 --> 07:48.926
he ain't sure yet
all he'd be going against.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.430
Maybe that is cause
for cutting some throats.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.516
That'd put you
right where he wants you.

07:55.684 --> 07:59.019
If you got other ways to move
on him is what he ain't clear about.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.208
(moaning)

08:31.678 --> 08:34.638
Messages from invisible sources,

08:34.806 --> 08:37.140
or what some people think of
as progress.

08:37.308 --> 08:40.936
Ain't the heathens used smoke signals
all through recorded history?

08:41.104 --> 08:43.563
How's that a fucking
recommendation?

08:43.732 --> 08:47.401
Well, it seems to me like, you know,
letters posted one person to another

08:47.569 --> 08:50.029
is just a slower version
of the same idea.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.657
When was the last time you got
a fucking letter from a stranger?

08:53.825 --> 08:56.577
- Bad news about Pa.
- Bad news!

08:56.745 --> 09:00.247
Tries against our interests is our
sole communications from strangers,

09:00.415 --> 09:03.209
so by all means, let's plant poles
all across the country,

09:03.376 --> 09:06.295
festoon the cocksucker with wires
to hurry the sorry word

09:06.463 --> 09:08.589
and blinker our judgments
of motive, huh?

09:08.757 --> 09:10.633
You've given it more thought than me.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.718
Ain't the state of things cloudy enough?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.970
Don't we face enough
fucking imponderables?

09:15.138 --> 09:17.473
Well, by God, you give the word, Al,

09:17.641 --> 09:19.808
and them poles will be kindling.

09:24.439 --> 09:29.526
After we've made love,
are you sometimes happy?

09:32.364 --> 09:35.741
Because I get up from the bed,
is that why you wonder?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.750
I'll intend something,

09:44.918 --> 09:47.419
come to myself realizing

09:47.587 --> 09:52.383
I've only stood or sat
thinking about you.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.888
Just now, that your toes
are beautiful,

09:58.056 --> 10:01.517
when I'd intended
to replenish the kindling.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.269
(giggling)

10:06.189 --> 10:09.191
I was raised believing

10:09.359 --> 10:14.780
dereliction of duty is
the one sure way to happiness.

10:16.283 --> 10:21.704
So often with you
I've been perfectly happy.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.915
(knocks on door)

10:25.083 --> 10:27.334
Ellsworth:
Can I start the shipment loading,

10:27.502 --> 10:29.503
keep the men from falling to drink?

10:29.671 --> 10:31.505
Yes, please.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.971
Now I believe in you.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.979
Ellsworth:
Start loading.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.485
Al:
Does Bullock think if I wanted,

10:53.653 --> 10:58.407
them four horsemen with rifles would
ward me off that woman's gold?

10:58.575 --> 11:01.618
Dan: Maybe it's just precautions
against the other operators.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.537
No precautions of his protect her.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.290
Them other operators
forebear out of respect for me

11:06.458 --> 11:09.918
and knowing what hot blood your blade
would draw if they ever fucking presumed.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.296
Well, he don't intend it as insult.

11:12.464 --> 11:16.008
- Uh, Bullock, that's my point.
- Horror is you're fucking right!

11:16.176 --> 11:20.012
He don't know if it's breathing
or taking it in through fucking gills,

11:20.180 --> 11:22.806
he is that fucking cunt-struck.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.809
They're afloat in some
fairy fucking bubble,

11:25.977 --> 11:29.521
lighter than air-- him, her snatch
and his stupid fucking badge.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.276
(gunshot)

11:34.444 --> 11:36.862
Where's that from?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.073
My guess would be No. 10.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.785
Hope it ain't Tom Nuttall taking
the quick fucking way out.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.205
No. No, there's himself.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.465
Self-deceiving cocksucker I am,

11:56.633 --> 12:00.594
I thought when America took us in,
Bullock would prove a fucking resource.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.264
Look at him, striding out
like some randy maniac bishop.

12:04.432 --> 12:08.394
Sheriff! About his duties
to the camp, huh?

12:08.561 --> 12:11.271
Luck trouble didn't jump out
earlier, huh, Bullock?

12:11.439 --> 12:14.858
Might have found you mid-thrust
at other business.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.902
What is it?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.321
Taken by a vision?

12:19.489 --> 12:22.991
You would not want to be
staring like that

12:23.159 --> 12:24.910
at me.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.204
It's only Bummer Dan.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.790
But I think he's killed.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.792
Be where I can find you.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.254
I ain't going no place.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.525
Dan: I'll, uh, go get my big gun.

12:56.693 --> 13:00.112
No, that ain't how
this wants to resolve.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.949
You go down, Dan,
see to the cunt and whiskey, huh?

13:04.117 --> 13:08.120
- Adams: You want me up here?
- You, go take your bath.

13:16.087 --> 13:19.423
You want a donkey's attention...

13:19.591 --> 13:22.634
bring a fucking pole down
between his ears.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.678
(sighs)

13:29.142 --> 13:32.436
Jeez. (groans)
Ow, fuck!

13:35.023 --> 13:38.317
No ways did I wish that man
harm or take against him.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.486
Seth:
You did shoot him, huh?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.279
Only on account of the jacket.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.740
Charlie: I'll hear it
from the other drunks.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.992
Harry mistook Bummer Dan
for Slippery Dan.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.994
That had pulled his cock out previous,

13:49.162 --> 13:51.997
- started filling the cuspidor yon!
- You will keep this short.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.375
Tom: Well, uh, Harry shouts
for Slippery to stop,

13:55.543 --> 13:58.587
but Slippery cast
his johnson toward Harry

13:58.755 --> 14:00.422
and pisses at him over the bar.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.966
I pulled my gun, Sheriff.
I told Slippery,

14:03.134 --> 14:05.177
"Get out, you're ruled off
for the day.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.680
You darken that door before dawn
tomorrow, I'll shoot you fucking dead."

14:08.848 --> 14:11.183
Harry's shirt front's urine-sopped still.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.102
But this is Bummer Dan.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.105
Man:
Oh my God, it's true!

14:17.273 --> 14:18.690
Tom:
Well, that's Slippery.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.902
Bummer's fucking dead.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.404
They know that,
you filthy piss-spraying beast!

14:24.572 --> 14:25.822
Get up off your knees.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.742
- Oh my God, Bummer--
- Get up and tell your part in this.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.703
My part, Sheriff, was putting
Bummer in my jacket

14:31.871 --> 14:33.664
and sending the poor fuck in here.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.541
To what purpose?

14:35.708 --> 14:39.211
Thinking maybe if Harry winged one
at Bummer mistaking him

14:39.379 --> 14:43.590
for me he'd threatened to murder,
it'd be funny.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.970
Harry:
What's my liability, Mr. Bullock?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.389
Hey, ain't getting
pissed on provocation?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.268
You didn't kill who you meant to,

14:54.435 --> 14:57.854
or mean to kill the man you did.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.362
What's my liability?

15:05.530 --> 15:06.947
Worse in some way?

15:07.115 --> 15:10.367
Box him and see he's buried.

15:10.535 --> 15:14.913
But I'm telling
both of you-- watch it!

15:17.250 --> 15:21.628
- May I retrieve my jacket off him, Deputy?
- Yeah, go ahead.

15:23.548 --> 15:27.217
Gee, the worst fucking joke
I ever played!

15:27.385 --> 15:30.470
Oh, why do I drink the way I do?

15:30.638 --> 15:34.141
He pulls that prick stunt again,
shoot him!

15:40.940 --> 15:43.900
- Wait up, Bullock!
- Private business, thanks.

15:44.068 --> 15:48.697
It won't be private if Swearengen's
got his cappers at his flanks.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.408
It's private. Thank you, Charlie.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.201
Man:
Soap with a prize inside!

15:53.369 --> 15:55.704
You got any prizes
in that meat there, Captain?

15:55.872 --> 15:57.873
- (laughing)
- Seth: This cocksucker.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.375
Friend, I got soap
with a prize inside.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.045
You were told to keep an interval

16:03.212 --> 16:05.589
between yourself
and legitimate merchants.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.967
I keep my interval, Sheriff.
It's their increase what's crowding me--

16:09.135 --> 16:11.303
We're gonna count out 25 paces.
We're at 14.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.971
- Count them with me. 15!
- 15.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.973
- 16, 17...
- 16, 17...

16:15.141 --> 16:18.644
- 18, 19, 20...
- 18, 19, 20...

16:18.811 --> 16:22.272
Why, Joanie Stubbs and Miss Lila.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.986
What brings you to the air
this fine spring morning?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.072
Stage from Bismarck.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.491
Cy:
Bismarck, you say?

16:32.659 --> 16:35.744
Don't the kid in all of us
look forward to the new arrival?

16:35.912 --> 16:38.413
I still tingle at the bottom
of my balls.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.582
(chuckling)
Who could it be?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.584
President Hayes?

16:42.752 --> 16:46.338
Maybe it's jugglers or face painters.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.257
Where do you feel it, honey?

16:49.425 --> 16:51.677
The bottom of your balls.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.941
Air's gone a little fixed.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.236
- I guess we know who fixed it.
- Excuse me.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.954
Boy: Look at the man
in the creek, Mama.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.248
He's panning for his fortune.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.126
- Won't see Mr. Bullock in the creek though.
- No.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.127
Didn't you say
he was the sheriff?

17:26.295 --> 17:28.171
Partner of Bullock & Star Hardware,

17:28.339 --> 17:31.049
Sheriff of Deadwood Camp.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.186
Cocksuckers!

17:56.492 --> 17:58.577
Bullock.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.954
Do I need to watch my back
against you?

18:01.122 --> 18:03.248
Al said to stay out of it.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.374
- (panting)
- Good morning.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.169
If you'd spare your partner
a gutting, Mr. Star,

18:49.337 --> 18:52.172
- you might make your way to The Gem.
- A gutting at whose hand?

18:52.340 --> 18:54.925
My boss called him out
clear across the thoroughfare.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.134
Unprovoked?

18:56.302 --> 19:00.555
He was seeing after Mrs. Garret's interests--
your partner-- when my boss shouted.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.730
- Would you lock up for me, please?
- Sure.

19:08.898 --> 19:12.567
Your boss should do like me
and learn to look the other way!

19:12.735 --> 19:14.486
It ain't his line.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.784
Age impedes my stream,

19:20.952 --> 19:23.620
- no fucking fear of you.
- Get in here.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.832
All in due fucking course,
but tell me one thing first,

19:26.999 --> 19:29.209
Bullock, as I stand here
fucking humbled:

19:29.377 --> 19:34.297
does the widow Garret have
a going fucking hard rock concern

19:34.465 --> 19:37.634
and five-stamp mill
crushing gold out of her quartz

19:37.802 --> 19:39.302
all day and fucking night?

19:39.470 --> 19:42.180
- What?
- But does she cast her lot with the camp,

19:42.348 --> 19:44.391
furnish others here
a chance to develop

19:44.559 --> 19:47.978
what they got,
to hang on or even prosper?

19:48.145 --> 19:52.190
You pie-faced cocksucker.
Get in here and account for your insult.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.569
Or with you at her ear--
among other points of entry--

19:55.736 --> 19:59.281
instead of doing her civic duty,
does she ship her fucking loot to Denver?

19:59.448 --> 20:02.742
Civic duty? Opposed by her own
and her dead husband's family,

20:02.910 --> 20:06.538
to put her assets at play in a camp with
no law or government worth the name?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.790
Al: Seeing here's where
she lives and struck lucky,

20:08.958 --> 20:12.085
civic duty? Yeah.
And it's time for her and some others

20:12.253 --> 20:15.714
to quit their fucking shirking.
Yankton's making its move.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.842
(shouts)
Ah, the fucking thing!

20:19.010 --> 20:21.970
Meaning what,
"Yankton's making its move"?

20:22.138 --> 20:24.723
Without more insults.

20:24.891 --> 20:28.018
Al: We're getting ass-fucked.
Carved into counties,

20:28.185 --> 20:30.729
but not one fucking commissioner
coming from the Hills.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.814
How do you have this information?

20:32.982 --> 20:36.026
From the governor himself
in a pricey little personal note.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.696
They want to make us a trough
for Yankton's snouts.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.531
Them hoople-heads out there, they need

20:41.699 --> 20:43.992
buttressing against going over
to those cocksuckers.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.785
Now I can handle my areas,

20:45.953 --> 20:49.080
but there's dimensions
and fucking angles I'm not expert at.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.750
You would be if you'd sheathe
your prick long enough...

20:51.918 --> 20:54.002
- Shut up.
- ...and resume being the upright

20:54.170 --> 20:56.588
pain in the balls
that graced us all last summer.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.007
Shut up, you son of a bitch.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.302
Jesus Christ.

21:02.470 --> 21:07.515
Bullock! The world abounds
in cunt of every kind,

21:07.683 --> 21:09.893
including hers.

21:23.282 --> 21:27.953
Of course, if it would steer you
from something stupid...

21:29.622 --> 21:33.416
I, uh, could always profess
another position.

21:33.584 --> 21:36.461
Will I find you've got a knife?

21:36.629 --> 21:39.005
I won't need no fucking knife.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.530
(both groaning)

22:15.251 --> 22:17.544
Trixie: They went over
the fucking balcony!

22:25.845 --> 22:28.179
Awful possibility in these matters is

22:28.347 --> 22:30.974
both men sustaining mortal injury...

22:33.185 --> 22:34.936
Stagehand: Whoa!

22:35.104 --> 22:37.689
Dan:
You looking to die, cocksucker?

22:42.236 --> 22:45.030
- He ain't your kill!
- God damn you!

22:46.157 --> 22:47.907
Hey hey.
Hey, don't come no further!

22:48.075 --> 22:49.659
Hey!

22:51.120 --> 22:52.829
Jesus Christ!

22:52.997 --> 22:56.166
Johnny: Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!

22:56.333 --> 22:58.209
(shouting)
Jesus Christ Almighty!

23:01.338 --> 23:02.964
Where's Bullock?

23:03.132 --> 23:04.507
Fuck me.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.468
I do have a knife.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.845
It come to me now.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.682
Al: Hmm?

23:21.358 --> 23:23.234
Welcome to fucking Deadwood!

23:26.072 --> 23:28.073
It can be combative.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.075
(groaning)

23:31.243 --> 23:34.496
...but I'm rarely that fucking lucky.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.499
(wheezes)

23:37.666 --> 23:40.210
(groans)

23:47.802 --> 23:50.386
Wave a penny
under the Jew's nose.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.931
If they've got
living breath in them,

23:53.099 --> 23:55.308
it brings them right 'round.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.363
Mr. Bullock.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.282
A happy surprise.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.202
Charlie: No one's dead!

24:14.370 --> 24:15.954
Mr. Star's shoulder's been hurt.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.623
Ain't that your high-end
whore friend Maddie?

24:18.791 --> 24:20.250
Joanie: Yes.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.253
Cy: That I thought had took
her snatch to New York?

24:23.420 --> 24:25.004
Joanie: Yes.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.632
Wonderful how folks
can get around now.

24:30.761 --> 24:33.221
Doc Cochran needs
to come from Whitewood.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.806
Yeah.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.018
AW Merrick.

24:39.186 --> 24:42.647
Seth: Mr. Star and Utter
should be taken to our store.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.983
All right.
All right.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.528
Hello, Mr. Bullock.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.446
Hello, William.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.616
I'm all right.

24:53.784 --> 24:56.161
I'd be grateful

24:56.328 --> 24:59.539
if you'd take
their belongings to a house

24:59.707 --> 25:01.708
- I built on the west edge.
- Mm-hmm.

25:14.096 --> 25:17.265
Better let me hold
Maddie's chair, Joanie.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.728
I need to make
a fucking impression.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.230
- My lady.
- My lord.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.737
Lack of notice is
my only regret.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.156
That's my fault for giving
Joanie none.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.200
Were you hedging
your bets, Maddie?

25:35.367 --> 25:36.868
(glass tinkling)

25:37.036 --> 25:39.787
Feared losing my nerve
all the way to the camp.

25:39.955 --> 25:43.750
Then wondered, had that coach
brought you to Gettysburg, huh?

25:46.003 --> 25:48.338
Gettysburg-- fucking battle carnage.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.381
- Yes, I wondered.
- (shouting) What?

25:50.549 --> 25:52.175
Wondered.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.889
(huffs) You secured that building,
honey, when?

25:59.892 --> 26:02.560
- November.
- Got the building in November

26:02.728 --> 26:04.604
I guess you'll be operating out of?

26:04.772 --> 26:07.148
Now I'd have thought a trick
would have been behind it,

26:07.316 --> 26:09.651
but Joanie's fuck money
has been going for jewels.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.736
How long we had that
understanding, honey?

26:11.904 --> 26:13.905
Since I was 14.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.407
I've been giving Joanie
jewels for her fuck money

26:16.575 --> 26:18.451
since she was 14 years of age,

26:18.619 --> 26:20.620
and not once did I come out ahead.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.580
Anyways.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.667
Anyways...

26:25.834 --> 26:27.669
since November,

26:27.836 --> 26:29.879
it looked to me
the project lay fallow,

26:30.047 --> 26:32.423
but I guess it was just germinating.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.342
Shall we talk in private, Cy?

26:34.510 --> 26:36.427
- Would that be rude?
- Not at all.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.973
I mean, a 18-year relationship
between me and Joanie,

26:40.140 --> 26:42.600
- just one moment alone?
- Of course not.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.146
Suck some pricks if you like.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.191
Keep whatever they give you
as my way of saying welcome.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.151
Any blind ones out there?

26:52.319 --> 26:54.070
(snickering, laughing)

26:57.032 --> 26:58.616
Al: Jesus Christ!

26:58.784 --> 27:01.160
- That bandage wants to be tight, Al.
- Does it!?

27:01.328 --> 27:03.913
Ask it if it wants to be wound
around your fucking neck!

27:04.081 --> 27:05.832
- Get away from me, Barney!
- Yes, sir.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.750
(wheezing)

27:07.918 --> 27:09.585
Fucking Adams.

27:09.753 --> 27:12.630
Restrained you, didn't he?

27:12.798 --> 27:14.465
Obstructs me in the thoroughfare,

27:14.633 --> 27:16.634
now he wants to bill and coo.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.511
(screaming)
Fuck!

27:18.679 --> 27:21.306
What was that Jewish fella
thinking, Dan,

27:21.473 --> 27:23.558
to charge at me with a purse gun?

27:23.726 --> 27:25.435
(Al wailing)

27:25.602 --> 27:27.895
That's just an unfamiliar situation.

27:28.063 --> 27:31.524
He just overplayed
trying to prove himself.

27:31.692 --> 27:32.692
Fuck fuck.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.403
Johnny: What was that whole
damn thing about, anyhow?

27:35.571 --> 27:37.905
Al's calling Bullock to the fold.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.035
Bullock ain't even of Al's flock.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.246
Al's gonna be calling numbers to the fold
now that he can't trust like us.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.665
Some he don't even like.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.836
We're joining America.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.881
And it's full of lying,
thieving cocksuckers

27:55.049 --> 27:56.883
that you can't trust at all--

27:57.051 --> 27:59.552
governors, commissioners
and whatnot.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.929
By God, that's just
the new way of things,

28:02.097 --> 28:04.557
and you just gonna have
to get used to it, Johnny.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.601
- All right.
- You gonna have to accept it

28:06.769 --> 28:08.895
and learn to control yourself.

28:09.063 --> 28:10.938
You get no argument from me!

28:11.106 --> 28:12.690
Okay.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.234
It's been me nudging you
from the nest, young lady,

28:15.402 --> 28:18.363
- urging you to take fucking wing!
- Okay.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.365
(panting)

28:20.532 --> 28:23.868
Where did the money come from
that bought that place?

28:24.995 --> 28:27.455
Your daddy sold me you
for six and a half bucks,

28:27.623 --> 28:29.957
so a rich relation is tough to swallow.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.796
It is respectful not to lie, honey,

28:34.963 --> 28:37.799
but any further silence
will get me violent.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.886
You know where
that backing came from.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.514
A farewell gesture
from Eddie Sawyer!

28:44.681 --> 28:46.724
(tin clatters)

28:47.726 --> 28:50.228
I knew Eddie had been
stealing from me,

28:50.396 --> 28:52.939
and then he flees and you
turn up owning that place.

28:53.107 --> 28:54.941
I don't work here no more, Cy.

28:55.109 --> 28:56.734
You understand?

28:56.902 --> 28:59.570
- No matter what.
- Hmm.

29:00.572 --> 29:04.409
It's kill you or let you go.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.497
Could I make it with you dead?

29:09.665 --> 29:11.666
Why try?

29:15.921 --> 29:17.588
Look at that.

29:19.925 --> 29:23.177
Look at that beautiful smile.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.726
All right, darling.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.854
Let me...

29:33.021 --> 29:35.690
let you go.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.112
Thank you.

29:43.490 --> 29:46.659
(chokes)
Shall we-- (clears throat)

29:46.827 --> 29:51.706
all take the air while Maddie
hears the happy news?

29:52.958 --> 29:55.334
Let's go get the fucking crone.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.464
I feel like a-- a boy.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.382
I feel like skipping.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.969
I'm that fucking hopeful
and excited for you.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.806
(chuckles)

30:10.767 --> 30:14.061
AW:
Doc, hot water.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.564
Doc:
Tell Wu that that drunk

30:16.732 --> 30:18.983
better not get ate by his pigs

30:19.151 --> 30:21.819
until I have had my way
with the corpse.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.864
Sol: I'm braced, Doc,
if you want to start digging.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.866
Doc: Momentarily.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.287
Charlie:
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.456
The ringing...

30:37.628 --> 30:39.587
I'm all right, William.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.383
Where are your gun
and badge, Mr. Bullock?

30:45.469 --> 30:48.804
It was personal between me
and the man I fought,

30:48.972 --> 30:52.558
- so I took them off.
- William: But he kept a knife.

30:52.726 --> 30:55.686
I didn't know that
when I disarmed.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.980
Will you arrest him now
for the knife?

30:58.148 --> 31:00.858
That's questions enough
for Mr. Bullock, William.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.031
- Doc: Give him another dose of laudanum.
- (Sol laughs)

31:07.199 --> 31:10.284
I got my load on, Doc.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.453
(groaning)

31:15.624 --> 31:17.375
Don't doubt...

31:17.543 --> 31:20.711
I'll have back
my gun and badge.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.713
(Trixie shushing)

31:22.881 --> 31:24.298
(clears throat)

31:24.466 --> 31:26.467
(groaning)

31:29.721 --> 31:32.473
Ahem!

31:40.649 --> 31:42.233
(Trixie shushing)

31:47.114 --> 31:49.115
(gasping)

31:53.704 --> 31:55.204
Al: Fuck.

31:55.372 --> 31:59.292
I found these seeing to your piss-pot
and I know they ain't yours.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.669
What tipped you off,
the fucking badge?

32:01.837 --> 32:03.296
Put them down.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.802
Is that some kind
of private fucking hilarity?

32:09.970 --> 32:12.096
- What?
- The piss-pot remark.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.514
Jewel: No.

32:13.682 --> 32:16.142
I made water off
the balcony this morning,

32:16.310 --> 32:19.270
if it's any of your fucking business.
Now get away from me.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.523
Not you, EB!
Get the fuck back here.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.651
Heavens.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.279
It's all like some
great Greek battle.

32:28.447 --> 32:32.033
Yeah, how about that fucking doc, huh?
Seeing to the respectable types,

32:32.200 --> 32:35.202
leaving us, the ones
that pay him regular, huh?

32:36.330 --> 32:40.583
So that woman
and child, Bullock's?

32:40.751 --> 32:43.085
His wife and son.

32:43.253 --> 32:45.630
Uh, how was Mr. Star?
How was Charlie Utter?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.423
Shut up, Johnny!

32:47.591 --> 32:49.592
(panting)

32:50.969 --> 32:53.179
Detail Bullock's condition.

32:53.347 --> 32:56.474
The worse for wear.
No clarity to his look or focus,

32:56.642 --> 32:59.226
as I could cite
in other combatants.

32:59.394 --> 33:04.315
You touch me, EB, I'll put your nose
through your fucking brain!

33:05.484 --> 33:08.235
Now did he state
his further intentions?

33:08.403 --> 33:10.696
To have his gun and badge back.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.823
In what fucking tone?

33:12.991 --> 33:15.451
I'd shy from putting a name on it, Al.

33:15.619 --> 33:18.162
(chuckles) He was talking
to an eight-year-old.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.373
It sound like he'd be
coming back for more?

33:20.540 --> 33:23.167
Well, I'd hate to guess
and be wrong.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.878
New whores on that coach, huh?

33:26.046 --> 33:27.880
Find out where they'll be working.

33:28.048 --> 33:31.258
I could take him his gun and badge,

33:31.426 --> 33:33.260
plumb his intent as we talk.

33:33.428 --> 33:36.764
And how would
that chat start, EB, huh?

33:36.932 --> 33:40.017
(mocking) "Here's your hardware,
and as he looks a cunt anyway,

33:40.185 --> 33:43.062
Al would like you to have this rose."

33:43.230 --> 33:46.565
I'll, uh, look into the new whores.

33:52.239 --> 33:54.323
How you doing?

33:54.491 --> 33:57.827
Uh, is my bullet out?
Will Star live?

33:57.994 --> 33:59.995
Well, if he don't, he's going happy.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.580
And-- and Mr. Utter?

34:01.748 --> 34:04.458
Will he be blind and deaf?

34:04.626 --> 34:05.710
No!

34:05.877 --> 34:07.878
Let me suss out
that new trim, Johnny,

34:08.045 --> 34:10.422
before I earn some added rebuke.

34:16.596 --> 34:19.473
Look, all's I'm saying is
I ain't your enemy.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.726
Whatever you thought
your intentions was

34:22.893 --> 34:24.937
coming on me like you did,

34:25.105 --> 34:28.690
nine times out of 10, that'll be
the last fucking move you ever make.

34:28.859 --> 34:31.569
Bullock will be coming back
for his weapon.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.571
To what intent?

34:33.739 --> 34:34.905
Open question.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.491
Well, we'll be ready.

34:37.659 --> 34:41.245
You've had your one out of 10.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.297
That cow-eyed kid looking
from that coach,

34:51.465 --> 34:54.925
that's what fucking unmanned me.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.475
(sighs)

35:02.642 --> 35:04.977
He couldn't have known
she was coming.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.151
Just today, I'd asked
Mr. Bullock after his family,

35:12.319 --> 35:14.820
and he made no mention
of their being en route.

35:14.988 --> 35:17.281
You're kind,
extending the hand of welcome.

35:17.449 --> 35:21.035
Well, at its best this camp can
be forbidding to new arrivals.

35:21.203 --> 35:23.412
That was very much
my experience.

35:23.580 --> 35:27.291
Let alone to come upon Mr. Bullock
in the mud of that thoroughfare,

35:27.459 --> 35:30.169
injured, who knows how seriously?

35:30.337 --> 35:33.130
Well, thank goodness he seemed
coming back to himself.

35:33.298 --> 35:37.384
Miss Isringhausen, I didn't realize medicine
was among your areas of expertise.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.222
It isn't, Mrs. Garret.

35:41.389 --> 35:45.351
Then perhaps I'll better learn
Mr. Bullock's condition in his presence.

35:48.230 --> 35:51.232
And Mr. Star's and Utter's condition.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.900
Yes, ma'am.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.069
Sofia?

35:57.823 --> 36:00.366
You put a ribbon
around your candy?

36:00.534 --> 36:04.912
And did you want me
to give it to that boy?

36:05.080 --> 36:06.997
Please answer in words, Sofia.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.833
Yes, please.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.835
(knock at door)

36:17.175 --> 36:19.176
- Miss Isringhausen.
- Mr. Ellsworth.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.720
I'm here to steer Mrs. Garret.

36:21.888 --> 36:26.225
Alma: Then Mr. Ellsworth
and I will make the delivery.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.857
(silent)

36:38.989 --> 36:41.240
Not as I'd been asked, Mrs. Garret,

36:41.408 --> 36:45.661
but I wonder if this ain't a call
better paid another day.

36:45.829 --> 36:50.666
I've stopped believing I can dictate
the terms of my opportunities.

36:50.834 --> 36:54.837
Well, some would say
it might be your choice

36:55.005 --> 36:57.673
what chances you decide not to take.

36:57.841 --> 37:02.511
Some being the butt-in loudmouth types.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.597
Shall I walk on alone, Mr. Ellsworth?

37:04.764 --> 37:06.640
No, ma'am.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.475
(grunts)

37:11.605 --> 37:14.231
I'm sorry for throwing up.

37:14.399 --> 37:18.110
If you hadn't, I would suspect
your previous habits.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.948
(moaning softly)

37:25.744 --> 37:26.869
Mr. Bullock.

37:27.037 --> 37:28.746
Mrs. Garret.

37:30.749 --> 37:35.336
- How are you feeling, Mr. Star?
- Sol: I've puked twice.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.046
- Mrs. Garret.
- Trixie.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.881
Mrs. Garret.

37:40.383 --> 37:41.842
Mr. Utter.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.929
Ma'am. Uh, don't be alarmed.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.972
A lot of this damage is old.

37:47.140 --> 37:50.184
May I introduce my wife Martha

37:50.352 --> 37:52.478
and our son William?

37:52.646 --> 37:54.271
Mrs. Alma Garret.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.273
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

37:56.441 --> 37:58.943
- How do you do, William?
- How do you do?

37:59.110 --> 38:02.571
And Ellsworth, who superintends
Mrs. Garret's claim.

38:02.739 --> 38:06.492
- Ma'am. William.
- William: How do you do?

38:08.620 --> 38:11.789
You've discovered us
in distressing circumstances.

38:11.957 --> 38:15.000
We're safe and glad
of joining Mr. Bullock.

38:25.845 --> 38:29.640
I hope this can be
of some use to you,

38:29.808 --> 38:31.934
uh, in your settling in.

38:32.102 --> 38:33.268
Thank you.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.937
Thank you.

38:35.105 --> 38:38.482
My ward includes sweets
for your son,

38:38.650 --> 38:40.776
when his mother decides
he may have them.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.236
Is your ward a boy?

38:42.404 --> 38:46.365
A girl, Sofia. A little younger
than you, I think.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.367
Oh.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.245
Thank you.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.462
You recall Mrs. Garret
from my letters.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.345
Yes.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.849
Charlie: That's good luck
you had right there.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.934
'Cause I carry the mail,

39:14.102 --> 39:16.562
and I'll admit today
before lay people,

39:16.730 --> 39:20.024
(chuckling) we lose more letters
than we deliver.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.192
(laughing)

39:31.536 --> 39:35.247
I'll say goodbye then, in hopes
that I see you again soon.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.041
Yes.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.880
I hope I see you soon, William.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.631
Thanks for the sweets.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.384
And don't be pestering me
for the good fishing spots.

39:47.552 --> 39:50.929
I name them only over breakfast
at the Grand Central Hotel,

39:51.097 --> 39:53.432
or what I call my dog.

39:59.814 --> 40:03.150
- Will you see your house?
- I would like to very much.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.444
AW:
Uh-- ahem-- Mrs. Bullock,

40:05.612 --> 40:08.572
I've retrieved your bonnet
from your former post.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.742
At your convenience, the readers
of the "Black Hills Pioneer" would be

40:11.910 --> 40:13.744
interested in hearing
about your journey

40:13.912 --> 40:16.914
and perhaps your first
impressions of our camp.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.291
You don't have to give 'em all.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.754
Thank you for seeing to Mr. Star.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.006
Trixie:
No need to hurry back.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.676
Go ahead, William.

40:32.305 --> 40:35.974
He never wrote of me
in his letters to her...

40:36.142 --> 40:37.768
did he?

40:37.936 --> 40:40.020
We never spoke on

40:40.188 --> 40:43.023
what he's wrote to his wife
or hadn't, Mrs. Garret.

40:44.234 --> 40:47.069
Or why he hadn't.

40:47.237 --> 40:49.279
No, ma'am.

40:49.447 --> 40:53.200
And you and me
hadn't ought to either.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.288
Thank you for taking me,
Mr. Ellsworth.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.457
You're welcome, ma'am.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.800
You'll recall...

41:10.969 --> 41:14.429
what I wrote about her husband?

41:15.723 --> 41:18.559
How he'd sought
his money back on a claim.

41:20.436 --> 41:22.062
He died in a fall

41:22.230 --> 41:25.315
before gaining satisfaction,

41:25.483 --> 41:27.985
and the claim proved out rich.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.655
William:
Is that the house, sir,

41:31.823 --> 41:34.491
- the splendid one ahead?
- It is.

41:34.659 --> 41:37.161
You can walk ahead
a little piece, William.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.121
Just a little piece.

41:39.289 --> 41:42.958
And of my promise
to help the widow...

41:44.627 --> 41:46.837
as I could,

41:47.005 --> 41:48.881
made to Wild Bill Hickok.

41:49.048 --> 41:52.176
Yes, Mr. Bullock. And you must
be as weary from the day's events

41:52.343 --> 41:54.970
and your work readying the house
as we are from travel.

41:55.138 --> 41:58.015
Please don't trouble
to repeat yourself.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.186
We traveled with that woman
and her boy.

42:02.353 --> 42:05.689
While the lady was traveling
with you, her husband the sheriff

42:05.857 --> 42:08.317
was pickling his prick
in the cunt brine of another.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.235
(door opens)

42:10.403 --> 42:12.237
Cy: Look at Lila,

42:12.405 --> 42:14.865
delivering her ducklings
all undamaged and dry.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.825
Joanie:
How are we gonna celebrate, Cy?

42:16.993 --> 42:19.203
Maddie:
My vote's for hardy but brief.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.080
Votes don't count here just yet.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.208
It looks a little small, Lila.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.544
But I guess you gals are
used to making the best of that.

42:29.297 --> 42:31.215
Just fleeting as fucking innocence,

42:31.382 --> 42:33.008
let me toast to bold new venture.

42:33.176 --> 42:35.886
- Your place got a name yet, honey?
- Le Chez Amis.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.804
That's catchy.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.515
Open your yap,
stick out your tongue.

42:40.683 --> 42:43.727
To the Chez Amis!

42:43.895 --> 42:45.395
And to--

42:45.563 --> 42:48.398
- Stick your fucking tongue out!
- (gags)

42:48.566 --> 42:50.067
--Joanie and Maddie,

42:50.235 --> 42:52.861
able hands
at a whorehouse tiller!

42:53.029 --> 42:55.781
And to...

42:55.949 --> 42:59.576
Doris, one of the Bella's
best cocksuckers,

42:59.744 --> 43:02.746
that I send with them
as a gesture of friendship.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.581
We have the girls we need.

43:04.749 --> 43:07.751
Bon voyage, sweetheart,
as long as we're speaking French.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.920
We got all the girls we need, Cy.

43:10.088 --> 43:14.758
Ah, don't fear that she'll spy, Joanie.
Please, don't reject Doris on that basis.

43:14.926 --> 43:18.011
You'll just get her belly cut by me
showing you I'm serious,

43:18.179 --> 43:20.764
and an uncut Bella whore
sent with you.

43:20.932 --> 43:24.559
Being as funds
stole from me by Eddie

43:24.727 --> 43:27.896
put the Chez Amis on its feet,
I consider myself an investor,

43:28.064 --> 43:30.440
and I will have
my interests looked at,

43:30.608 --> 43:32.776
60¢ from dollar one

43:32.944 --> 43:35.821
and a true count fucking verified.

43:35.989 --> 43:38.407
All right.
(whispers) Fine.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.828
Get these girls out of here, Lila!

43:42.996 --> 43:44.746
You better get packed, Doris.

43:44.914 --> 43:47.582
Did you bring anything
with you when I bought you?

43:47.750 --> 43:49.251
That's all right, honey.

43:49.419 --> 43:52.296
You just pack the rags
you been wiping the cum off with.

43:52.463 --> 43:55.299
- All right, Joanie?!
- Yes. And now we're gonna go.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.969
What do you think,
I'm a monkey in a zoo?

43:59.137 --> 44:01.138
Think I'm gonna throw
my shit after you?

44:01.306 --> 44:02.931
No.

44:03.099 --> 44:05.350
Don't fucking talk
to me like I'm no monkey.

44:05.518 --> 44:08.145
Get those cunts out of here!

44:08.313 --> 44:10.647
Don't believe
there's no good women

44:10.815 --> 44:13.650
till you've seen one
with maggots in her eyes.

44:16.154 --> 44:18.447
Joanie!

44:18.614 --> 44:21.783
Bet the wheel before you leave.
You're on a lucky run.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.962
William: Is there fish
in this stream?

44:34.130 --> 44:35.922
Sometimes.

44:43.556 --> 44:45.307
This is it.

44:48.853 --> 44:50.812
May we go inside?

44:50.980 --> 44:53.190
Did you get the letter
about the house?

44:53.358 --> 44:56.360
(sighs)
I did get that letter.

44:56.527 --> 44:59.029
It's at the very top of my trunk.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.906
That has all my thoughts.

45:04.577 --> 45:06.703
May we go in?

45:10.375 --> 45:12.250
I should go back now.

45:12.418 --> 45:14.419
You and the boy go in.

45:16.255 --> 45:19.341
Let's go in the house Mr. Bullock
has made us, William.

45:20.385 --> 45:22.052
Come on, Mr. Bullock.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.429
Not just now, William.

45:24.597 --> 45:26.098
Don't you want to come in?

45:26.265 --> 45:30.519
I can't come in just now.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.229
After you've seen to the camp,

45:32.397 --> 45:34.856
gotten your gun and badge back?

45:43.741 --> 45:45.784
I'll take my mother in.

45:45.952 --> 45:48.245
Thank you.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.414
Come on, Mother.

45:54.127 --> 45:56.128
Thank you.

46:03.553 --> 46:08.098
Seth's voice: "Dear Mrs. Bullock,
your house is near finished.

46:08.266 --> 46:12.102
My satisfaction does not exceed
the camp's lumbermen and sawyers

46:12.270 --> 46:16.106
whose patience I have tried by
my overwatchful eye for greenness

46:16.274 --> 46:19.109
and for good square-edge
quality in the cut boards.

46:19.277 --> 46:22.904
I've chosen pine,
one-year seasoned,

46:23.072 --> 46:25.615
for the sills, posts,
floor joists and rafters.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.618
The other framing timber is of spruce.

46:28.786 --> 46:30.829
Where partitions bear upon them,

46:30.997 --> 46:33.665
I have doubled the beams
and supported the floor

46:33.833 --> 46:36.626
with locus posts set
three feet into the ground.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.546
I think you may laugh
to see the mullioned windows

46:39.714 --> 46:41.965
with their view of the camp
from out the parlor.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.969
Being unfinished,
they look like unfocused eyes.

46:46.137 --> 46:49.431
I've left these and all final
decorative choices

46:49.599 --> 46:53.143
to your superior judgment
and sensibility."

46:54.187 --> 46:56.897
Soap!
Soap with a prize inside!

46:57.064 --> 46:58.732
(feigning coughing)

46:58.900 --> 47:01.943
"I hope that you and the boy may
arrive in good health and safety.

47:02.111 --> 47:05.947
I look forward to our opportunity
to better get to know each other.

47:06.115 --> 47:08.366
I pray that in my brother's stead,

47:08.534 --> 47:11.953
I may be permitted
to be a father to the boy

47:12.121 --> 47:14.873
as good as Robert would have been,

47:15.041 --> 47:18.502
and as to your care
and comfort and safety,

47:18.669 --> 47:20.921
as good a husband to you.

47:21.088 --> 47:24.591
Yours sincerely, Seth Bullock."
