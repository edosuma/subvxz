01:58.358 --> 02:01.195
You're not supposed
to be here.

02:07.067 --> 02:09.068
You know better.

02:13.072 --> 02:15.375
It's a beautiful night.

02:18.411 --> 02:20.681
Share it with me.

02:22.548 --> 02:25.385
You can get yourself back in.

02:45.272 --> 02:47.241
You're mad.

02:52.946 --> 02:55.249
- Birdie.
- Don't call me that.

02:56.316 --> 02:59.384
We can skip your exercise.

02:59.418 --> 03:02.555
You fit that in last night.

03:02.589 --> 03:05.323
I was...
trying to talk to you.

03:05.357 --> 03:08.127
I'm not interested
in that talk.

03:09.863 --> 03:11.731
- Anna...
- No.

03:24.043 --> 03:26.112
It won't change anything.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.596
Hey.

03:43.929 --> 03:45.765
You must be Anna.

03:49.501 --> 03:51.169
Who are you?

03:51.203 --> 03:52.972
Oh, sweetie,

03:53.006 --> 03:56.442
did he not tell you
that I was coming?

03:56.476 --> 03:58.612
I'm the lawyer.

04:01.180 --> 04:03.983
So your brother's
already approved these.

04:04.017 --> 04:07.119
He's taken care of everything,
so when the time comes,

04:07.153 --> 04:09.322
you won't have to make
any arrangements.

04:09.356 --> 04:12.225
I just need a signature.

04:13.326 --> 04:17.463
Anna, I'm here to help Conrad
get what he wants.

04:17.497 --> 04:20.466
What he wants is for you
to be taken care of.

04:26.505 --> 04:28.940
My mother had it too.

04:28.974 --> 04:30.509
Not pancreatic, but...

04:30.543 --> 04:34.814
I do know how hard it is.

04:36.216 --> 04:40.019
And acceptance is only a choice
that you can make.

04:43.356 --> 04:45.759
Then I won't choose.

04:49.962 --> 04:52.197
Submitted for your approval.

04:52.231 --> 04:53.932
Today's offering:

04:53.966 --> 04:55.500
meatloaf.

04:55.534 --> 04:57.603
Loaf: confirmed. Meat:

04:57.637 --> 04:59.504
jury's out.

04:59.538 --> 05:02.675
Green beans almondine:
nutty, beanie.

05:02.709 --> 05:06.077
And the pièce de résistance?

05:06.111 --> 05:08.447
Apple cobbler:

05:08.481 --> 05:10.216
sweet, tart.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.683
Uh-huh.

05:11.717 --> 05:14.086
Uh... it's...

05:14.120 --> 05:16.221
it's really good.

05:16.255 --> 05:18.089
This a bad time?

05:18.123 --> 05:20.125
No, she was just leaving.

05:20.159 --> 05:23.028
As soon as I get a signature.

05:30.570 --> 05:33.240
Okay, alright...

05:35.108 --> 05:37.540
I got you.

05:37.574 --> 05:40.045
Okay. Okay. It's okay.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.692
I don't know how I'm gonna
do this without you.

05:53.726 --> 05:55.728
Ah...

05:57.296 --> 06:00.399
I'll be with you.

06:00.433 --> 06:03.603
You don't believe
in that stuff.

06:05.604 --> 06:09.408
I'm not talking
about that stuff.

06:09.442 --> 06:12.711
I'm talking about us.

06:12.745 --> 06:15.915
What we've been through
together.

06:18.151 --> 06:21.622
You're stronger now
because of it.

06:24.457 --> 06:26.324
Hey...

06:26.358 --> 06:31.596
you can't stay locked up
forever.

06:31.630 --> 06:35.767
You have to get out
and be a part of the world.

06:35.801 --> 06:38.303
I want to leave me alone.

06:38.337 --> 06:41.307
That's not the way it works.

06:43.308 --> 06:46.312
It's time to forgive Dad.

06:47.346 --> 06:50.550
- Birdie...
- Stop.

06:52.651 --> 06:56.490
I will never forgive him
for what he did.

06:58.358 --> 07:00.326
Anna...

08:34.586 --> 08:37.923
I have terrible news.

08:40.592 --> 08:42.427
Beef Stroganoff.

08:42.461 --> 08:45.263
But there's a glimmer of hope.

08:45.297 --> 08:46.932
Tater tots!

09:06.319 --> 09:08.686
Maybe it's good.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.457
He's not suffering anymore.

09:12.791 --> 09:16.328
There's gotta be some kind
of relief in that, right?

09:16.362 --> 09:19.464
You've been so strong
this whole time.

09:19.498 --> 09:22.300
Never heard you complain.
Not once.

09:22.334 --> 09:25.806
On this job, trust me,
it's rare.

09:29.809 --> 09:31.709
It's not a relief.

09:31.743 --> 09:36.315
Yeah... sorry,
that came out wrong.

09:36.349 --> 09:38.316
All I mean is...

09:38.350 --> 09:40.419
it's impressive, you know.

09:40.453 --> 09:42.122
You're impressive.

09:45.825 --> 09:48.493
So what's the plan, then?

09:48.527 --> 09:52.330
Are you... gonna keep the place,
or...

09:52.364 --> 09:53.799
What?

09:53.833 --> 09:56.502
Are you gonna keep the place?

09:56.536 --> 09:57.969
Oh, of course.

09:58.003 --> 09:59.905
Where would I go?

09:59.939 --> 10:04.609
No, it's just some people need
to leave in order to move on.

10:04.643 --> 10:07.514
But... this is my home.

10:08.547 --> 10:10.516
Yeah, okay.

10:17.556 --> 10:19.824
Could you leave that easily?

10:19.858 --> 10:21.560
You know,
I shouldn't have asked.

10:21.594 --> 10:24.662
No. Could you?

10:24.696 --> 10:27.999
Well... not everybody feels
so strongly about home.

10:28.033 --> 10:31.871
Not everybody feels
like they have a home.

10:33.705 --> 10:37.244
- Then why haven't you left?
- One guess.

10:38.411 --> 10:40.345
Girlfriend.

10:40.379 --> 10:42.013
No.

10:42.047 --> 10:46.019
I haven't really made the best
decisions in that department.

11:16.081 --> 11:18.550
Whoa.

11:18.584 --> 11:22.054
That's your last reason
for not leaving, right?

11:22.088 --> 11:24.422
Uh, I...

11:24.456 --> 11:26.058
I...

11:26.092 --> 11:28.060
I can't take this.

11:28.094 --> 11:31.729
No, I have more than I know
what to do with, honest.

11:31.763 --> 11:33.598
Take it.

11:33.632 --> 11:35.769
Make your escape.

11:43.876 --> 11:45.743
I'm sorry.

11:45.777 --> 11:48.014
I just can't.

12:18.810 --> 12:20.646
<i>Hello.</i>

12:20.680 --> 12:22.481
<i>You've reached
the Rook residence.</i>

12:22.515 --> 12:24.916
<i>Conrad and Anna
aren't available right now.</i>

12:24.950 --> 12:28.654
<i>If you leave a message,
I will return your call.</i>

12:28.688 --> 12:30.421
<i>Hey, Anna.</i>

12:30.455 --> 12:32.858
<i>This is Charlotte.
I was just thinking about you,</i>

12:32.892 --> 12:36.795
<i>and I wanted to let you know
how proud I am of you for,</i>

12:36.829 --> 12:38.664
<i>you know, facing your fears,</i>

12:38.698 --> 12:41.666
and getting out there and
going to your brother's funeral.

12:41.700 --> 12:44.036
<i>Um, so I guess
I'll see you there.</i>

12:44.070 --> 12:46.137
<i>Okay, bye-bye.</i>

12:46.171 --> 12:48.707
<i>Hey, Anna. This is Charlotte.</i>

12:48.741 --> 12:52.044
<i>I know you've been struggling,
but you can do this.</i>

12:52.078 --> 12:55.113
<i>I'll see you at the funeral,
sweetie. Stay strong.</i>

12:55.147 --> 12:57.549
<i>Anna, are you there?</i>

12:57.583 --> 13:00.386
<i>Anna, please pick up the phone.</i>

13:00.420 --> 13:01.819
<i>Look, the funeral's starting.</i>

13:01.853 --> 13:04.390
<i>If you leave now,
you can still make it.</i>

13:04.424 --> 13:05.991
<i>Please come.
I really hope you...</i>

13:57.209 --> 13:59.744
Hey, go around back.

13:59.778 --> 14:02.214
And don't let anyone see you.

14:56.669 --> 15:00.807
Alright, let's make this quick.
You know what to look for.

15:39.344 --> 15:42.447
What's that?

16:05.304 --> 16:08.541
Find her. Cut the phone line.

17:50.008 --> 17:53.110
Ah!

17:53.144 --> 17:55.714
She's upstairs!

18:05.857 --> 18:07.993
What the hell?

18:30.149 --> 18:32.818
You're not supposed to be here.

18:32.852 --> 18:35.854
Please, stop looking at me.
Please, okay?

18:35.888 --> 18:37.888
Explain it to me.

18:37.922 --> 18:40.359
Why aren't you
at your brother's funeral?

18:45.363 --> 18:48.133
You're Anna, right?

18:48.167 --> 18:51.002
Okay, Anna...

18:51.036 --> 18:55.040
I need you
to be straight with me.

18:55.074 --> 18:57.610
I need to know
where you keep the money.

19:00.011 --> 19:01.980
What are you doing?

19:02.014 --> 19:04.281
Always be prepared.

19:04.315 --> 19:08.352
I'm sorry, prepared for what?
This is fucking crazy, JP.

19:08.386 --> 19:10.955
We should just fucking leave,
goddammit!

19:10.989 --> 19:13.023
Use my name again,
why don't you?!

19:13.057 --> 19:15.028
Go ahead!

19:16.862 --> 19:19.231
There's nothing
on the scanner.

19:19.265 --> 19:22.867
So... looks like
she didn't call anybody.

19:22.901 --> 19:25.070
Did you?

19:32.545 --> 19:35.446
You're an odd bird.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.883
Look at me.

19:37.917 --> 19:42.354
Three men break into your home
and you don't call the police?

19:42.388 --> 19:45.823
I was scared.
I... didn't have time to think.

19:45.857 --> 19:49.528
I have a solution.

19:49.562 --> 19:53.197
Just a quick little love tap
behind the ear.

19:53.231 --> 19:56.134
We are not doing that!
We are not doing that!

19:56.168 --> 19:58.502
- Hey.
- Then we burn this fucker down.

19:58.536 --> 20:00.806
Fucking Chri...
you gonna stop this shit?

20:00.840 --> 20:02.240
Hey, go make some coffee.

20:02.274 --> 20:04.909
- What?
- Go make some coffee.

20:04.943 --> 20:06.310
Go.

20:06.344 --> 20:08.548
Let the adults talk.

20:09.949 --> 20:11.717
Ah, fuck it.

20:17.456 --> 20:19.957
So?

20:19.991 --> 20:21.760
We're not killing anyone.

20:25.430 --> 20:29.166
Can I leave you alone with her
without making a mess of things?

20:29.200 --> 20:31.302
- Of course.
- I mean it.

20:31.336 --> 20:35.240
- I'm calm as fuck.
- Hey, I mean it.

20:39.143 --> 20:41.247
Scout's honour.

20:47.952 --> 20:50.120
They don't have any coffee.

20:50.154 --> 20:51.589
Forget it.

20:51.623 --> 20:53.358
I've got a plan.

20:53.392 --> 20:55.292
Ah, yeah?
You always got a plan.

20:55.326 --> 20:58.096
You always expect me
to be a part of it,

20:58.130 --> 21:00.898
but I'm not Perry, okay?
I'm not your fucking lapdog!

21:00.932 --> 21:04.302
Look, if you wanna leave,
this is the time to go.

21:06.471 --> 21:08.640
Really?

21:14.013 --> 21:15.848
What about you?

21:17.016 --> 21:19.050
I'm still thinking it through.

21:19.084 --> 21:21.485
Look, I could get the money.

21:21.519 --> 21:24.155
This shit just got
a little complicated.

21:24.189 --> 21:25.624
Yeah, a little.

21:25.658 --> 21:28.193
Look, you're still clean,
little brother.

21:28.227 --> 21:30.595
Let's keep it that way, okay?

21:30.629 --> 21:34.598
Come on, man,
you know I need this money too.

21:34.632 --> 21:37.234
Does that mean
you're with me on this, huh?

21:37.268 --> 21:39.471
All the way.

21:39.505 --> 21:41.239
All the way.

21:41.273 --> 21:43.910
Let's go find it.

21:55.219 --> 21:56.687
Jesus.

21:56.721 --> 21:59.223
Fucking mess, man.

22:08.066 --> 22:10.234
What was that before?

22:10.268 --> 22:12.503
Just leave me alone, please.

22:12.537 --> 22:14.438
You were gone.

22:14.472 --> 22:17.542
Why didn't you run?

22:19.711 --> 22:21.512
Nowhere to go.

22:21.546 --> 22:23.682
That's not it.

22:26.250 --> 22:28.686
There's something else going on.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.923
Hmm?

22:42.367 --> 22:45.237
What's in there?

22:50.476 --> 22:54.247
Vance, just get started.
I'm gonna get this room.

23:00.451 --> 23:03.754
- Ow.
- You gotta be shitting me.

23:03.788 --> 23:07.425
So you're telling me
you haven't left this house...

23:07.459 --> 23:09.426
in over 10 years?

23:09.460 --> 23:11.763
Yeah.

23:15.334 --> 23:17.303
Okay.

23:18.469 --> 23:22.307
I can just leave this door open.

23:22.341 --> 23:25.242
I can go make myself
a cup of tea.

23:25.276 --> 23:28.413
When I come back...

23:28.447 --> 23:30.650
...you're still sitting there?

23:34.819 --> 23:36.620
That's crazy.

23:38.356 --> 23:40.157
Ah, fuck, that's sad.

23:40.191 --> 23:42.662
This is actually really sad.

23:52.703 --> 23:55.272
Hey, you know what?

23:55.306 --> 23:57.809
I think I can help you.

24:00.245 --> 24:02.547
No, no, no!

24:02.581 --> 24:04.648
- No! No!!
- Huh? C'mere!

24:04.682 --> 24:07.385
Stop, please!
Please, please, please!

24:07.419 --> 24:10.155
- C'mere! C'mere!
- Please stop! Stop!

24:19.131 --> 24:21.534
No, no, no...

24:27.405 --> 24:29.206
See?

24:29.240 --> 24:30.774
It's not so bad.

24:30.808 --> 24:34.479
I got you. I got you. Okay.
What the hell did you do?

24:34.513 --> 24:37.381
She doesn't go outside.
I was just trying to show her.

24:37.415 --> 24:38.782
You gonna be okay?

24:38.816 --> 24:42.186
Perry, go inside.

24:42.220 --> 24:45.423
Hey, I need you to focus.

24:45.457 --> 24:48.393
- Let me back in!
- Hey, hey, we go back inside,

24:48.427 --> 24:50.494
- Perry's gonna kill you.
- I don't care.

24:50.528 --> 24:53.031
Please!!!

24:59.872 --> 25:04.242
Anna. Anna, we looked upstairs
and we didn't find anything.

25:04.276 --> 25:07.412
Look, is there an attic?

25:07.446 --> 25:10.415
Huh? Huh? Safe?

25:10.449 --> 25:12.416
Basement?

25:12.450 --> 25:14.685
Huh? Huh?

25:14.719 --> 25:18.423
Basement? Huh? Basement?

25:18.457 --> 25:22.760
Okay.
Okay, let's get you back inside.

25:22.794 --> 25:26.065
Take her upstairs,
get her cleaned up.

25:29.267 --> 25:32.169
Well, you had your chance
to leave.

25:32.203 --> 25:35.439
Look, don't make me regret
letting you stay.

25:35.473 --> 25:37.075
Fuck.

25:45.316 --> 25:47.452
God-fuckin'...

25:59.965 --> 26:02.802
Put these on.

26:13.644 --> 26:17.615
Hey, you sure you don't
want me to look after her?

26:17.649 --> 26:19.817
- After what you just pulled?
- I'm just saying,

26:19.851 --> 26:22.486
do you really think
Vance is up for this?

26:22.520 --> 26:24.355
He'll be fine.

26:30.661 --> 26:33.431
You gonna tell me
what we're doing down here?

26:33.465 --> 26:36.502
Trust me, man,
we hit the jackpot.

26:39.904 --> 26:41.638
Yeah...

26:41.672 --> 26:43.741
Jackpot.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.150
Uh... what the hell?

26:53.719 --> 26:57.655
Oh, you like sitting around
in your own pee. Got it.

26:57.689 --> 27:00.358
Just change, please.

27:00.392 --> 27:03.194
I... I can't. Ahem.

27:12.903 --> 27:14.672
Ouch.

27:14.706 --> 27:16.709
Sorry.

27:17.976 --> 27:20.913
Fuck!

27:22.780 --> 27:25.416
Come over here man.
Gimme a hand with this.

27:25.450 --> 27:27.685
I'm more curious
what's behind door number two.

27:27.719 --> 27:29.553
Why's that?

27:29.587 --> 27:31.557
No handle.

27:42.734 --> 27:44.801
Uh...

27:44.835 --> 27:47.539
it can be hard...

27:48.606 --> 27:50.340
...to be with someone

27:50.374 --> 27:53.511
who has
such a strong personality.

27:53.545 --> 27:54.878
I can tell...

27:54.912 --> 27:57.314
you're just going along.

27:57.348 --> 27:59.217
I can see it.

28:02.754 --> 28:05.557
Don't you fucking shrink me.

28:06.624 --> 28:07.992
Ow.

28:08.026 --> 28:11.729
Don't think I've dealt
with this my entire life?

28:11.763 --> 28:14.898
Maybe I was the one
who found out about this place.

28:14.932 --> 28:16.733
You ever think about that?

28:16.767 --> 28:20.504
I mean, maybe this whole thing
was my idea?

28:20.538 --> 28:22.973
I don't think you realize
how serious this is.

28:23.007 --> 28:25.009
- No, I do.
- You've seen our faces.

28:25.043 --> 28:26.910
You know our names.

28:26.944 --> 28:30.248
You really think
we're just gonna let you go?

28:31.482 --> 28:33.617
Now put on
the fucking sweatpants!

28:33.651 --> 28:34.985
Stop!

28:35.019 --> 28:36.921
- Please, stop!
- Stop moving, goddammit!

28:36.955 --> 28:38.755
- Stop! Stop...
- Hey! What the hell?!

28:38.789 --> 28:41.059
- Stop it!
- Hey! Get the fuck off her!

28:41.093 --> 28:44.028
- It's not what it looks like!
- What are you doing?

28:44.062 --> 28:45.929
- Honestly...
- Are you okay?

28:45.963 --> 28:48.598
...you gotta listen to me!
She wasn't supposed to be here.

28:48.632 --> 28:50.335
- Listen to me, Danny, please!
- Get back!

28:50.369 --> 28:53.604
Dan...
you guys know each other?

28:53.638 --> 28:55.072
Yes, but that's not...

28:55.106 --> 28:56.808
- No, no.
- Anna, Anna,

28:56.842 --> 28:59.077
- I had nothing to do with this.
- You cannot be here.

28:59.111 --> 29:01.044
- You gotta get out of here, okay?
- Oh, shit!

29:01.078 --> 29:03.880
- Get back.
- You cannot be here, Danny.

29:03.914 --> 29:06.751
Honest, if we knew
she was gonna be here...

29:06.785 --> 29:08.953
- What do you mean, "we"?
- Danny boy.

29:08.987 --> 29:10.687
Leave him alone, dude!

29:10.721 --> 29:13.791
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Where is she?

29:13.825 --> 29:15.728
Huh?

29:17.696 --> 29:18.963
Fuck.

29:18.997 --> 29:20.998
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What?!

29:21.032 --> 29:23.235
Do you know
how this has to end?

29:24.702 --> 29:26.838
We can't let her go.

29:29.708 --> 29:31.677
Just find her.

29:33.711 --> 29:35.847
Come on.

29:59.136 --> 30:01.439
You like to disappear,
don't you?

30:04.209 --> 30:07.179
Come out and play, little girl.

30:13.051 --> 30:16.820
I got a few tricks of my own.

30:28.900 --> 30:30.903
C'mere.

30:36.775 --> 30:40.011
For my next trick,
I would like to invite

30:40.045 --> 30:42.213
my lovely assistant
to the stage.

30:42.247 --> 30:45.951
Anna, would you be so kind
as to join us?

30:47.619 --> 30:50.221
I don't think she's coming.

30:50.255 --> 30:52.758
It's really too bad.

30:53.792 --> 30:56.226
She would've been
of great value to us.

30:56.260 --> 30:59.397
I guess I'll have to do this
on my own.

31:09.039 --> 31:12.276
Hey. Perry!

31:16.515 --> 31:19.015
- Open wide, Dan.
- What the fuck?

31:19.049 --> 31:21.953
Stupid thing didn't talk.

32:20.178 --> 32:23.048
- Ah! Oh!
- I found her!

32:24.716 --> 32:27.918
- You got her?
- Yeah, I got her!

32:27.952 --> 32:31.121
Get the fuck off there! Please.

32:31.155 --> 32:33.089
Don't you understand
I'm the least

32:33.123 --> 32:35.326
of your fucking worries
right now?! Please!

33:01.219 --> 33:03.354
Come on.

33:03.388 --> 33:06.123
He's taking his time.

33:06.157 --> 33:09.859
If he loses her,
we'll find her.

33:09.893 --> 33:12.029
Put out some breadcrumbs,
she'll come.

33:13.797 --> 33:16.099
Come on, man, be serious.

33:16.133 --> 33:18.237
Maybe I am.

33:32.083 --> 33:34.385
You got her?

33:46.430 --> 33:49.000
You hear that?

34:00.277 --> 34:02.547
Stay.

34:12.290 --> 34:14.592
No! No!

34:15.859 --> 34:18.262
Vance!

34:18.295 --> 34:19.897
Vance!!

34:19.931 --> 34:21.264
Vance!!!

34:21.299 --> 34:23.400
Vance!

34:23.435 --> 34:25.971
Wake up!!

34:27.772 --> 34:29.371
Is he dead?

34:29.406 --> 34:31.242
Argh...

34:31.275 --> 34:34.377
Ah, goddamn. Argh...

34:34.411 --> 34:36.614
Ah, Vance.

34:46.123 --> 34:48.359
Hey. Hey! Hey, you, open!

34:48.393 --> 34:53.098
Open it, you fucking bitch!
Open the fucking door!

35:00.872 --> 35:02.606
Anna!

35:04.341 --> 35:06.010
Anna...

35:06.044 --> 35:08.144
Come on!

35:25.062 --> 35:27.198
Hello?

35:42.513 --> 35:45.916
Hey, JP, something weird
is going on here, man.

35:45.950 --> 35:49.487
Come on, we gotta
get the fuck outta here.

35:55.893 --> 35:58.195
Oh, fuck.

36:04.868 --> 36:07.805
You bitch!
You fucking bitch!!

36:07.839 --> 36:09.541
Get down here!

36:24.989 --> 36:26.557
Argh!

36:26.591 --> 36:28.726
Fucking bitch!

36:30.127 --> 36:31.762
Argh!

37:03.594 --> 37:07.364
Is she making fucking tea?

37:20.178 --> 37:22.580
Hey, nothing in here's
gonna get us up there.

37:22.614 --> 37:24.615
Let's drag
this fucking cabinet in there.

37:24.649 --> 37:26.885
It's bolted to the wall.

37:40.665 --> 37:43.200
- Goddammit!
- Doesn't matter.

37:43.234 --> 37:45.501
She was behind
that fucking door,

37:45.535 --> 37:48.638
and then she was up there,
like that!

37:48.672 --> 37:50.406
The bitch doesn't have wings.

37:52.343 --> 37:53.977
Anna!

37:54.011 --> 37:56.514
Anna. Help me.

37:58.049 --> 37:59.684
Hurry!

38:01.986 --> 38:04.322
Cut me loose.

38:06.223 --> 38:09.026
Robbing me...
during Conrad's funeral?

38:09.060 --> 38:10.593
No, no.

38:10.627 --> 38:14.198
- They did this, not me!
- Then what are you doing here?

38:14.232 --> 38:17.669
I... I wanted
to be there for you.

38:22.073 --> 38:23.673
You...

38:23.707 --> 38:25.408
you went?

38:25.442 --> 38:27.510
You didn't show.

38:27.544 --> 38:29.680
I got worried.

38:29.714 --> 38:32.348
Was it...

38:32.382 --> 38:34.450
was it nice?

38:34.484 --> 38:38.388
It... it was peaceful.

38:38.422 --> 38:40.692
Nobody came?

38:42.093 --> 38:44.595
No, uh, it was me and...

38:44.629 --> 38:47.064
Charlotte and the priest.

38:47.098 --> 38:48.531
He gave a good talk.

38:48.565 --> 38:51.968
It was... it was really nice.

38:52.002 --> 38:53.704
It's okay.

38:53.738 --> 38:56.372
You know, it was...

38:56.406 --> 38:58.542
just me and him.

38:58.576 --> 39:01.246
We only had each other.

39:10.288 --> 39:12.722
Do you know
you've been bringing us food

39:12.756 --> 39:15.258
for almost a year?

39:15.292 --> 39:17.260
I checked the calendar.

39:17.294 --> 39:19.263
Almost to the day.

39:19.297 --> 39:22.566
It feels like longer,
doesn't it?

39:22.600 --> 39:24.401
A-Anna.

39:24.435 --> 39:27.137
Is that how you do it?

39:27.171 --> 39:28.738
You go into people's homes
and...

39:28.772 --> 39:31.441
...steal their things
and then you call your friends

39:31.475 --> 39:34.644
- to go and steal all of it?
- They're not my friends!

39:34.678 --> 39:38.582
Well... Vance is, but...

39:38.616 --> 39:40.517
...not the other two.

39:40.551 --> 39:43.220
You told him about the money?

39:43.254 --> 39:44.754
I... I...

39:44.788 --> 39:46.557
I told him about you.

39:46.591 --> 39:48.524
I told him about your situation.

39:48.558 --> 39:52.262
And, yeah, I told him
you tried to give me money.

39:52.296 --> 39:55.631
It took me off-guard.
I didn't mean...

39:55.665 --> 39:58.635
I... I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

39:58.669 --> 40:01.639
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

40:06.643 --> 40:10.314
You know,
I almost believe you this time.

40:10.348 --> 40:13.383
Listen to me.
I get if you hate me,

40:13.417 --> 40:16.285
but you have to believe...

40:16.319 --> 40:19.523
I would never hurt you.

40:22.393 --> 40:24.160
What happened to you?

40:24.194 --> 40:27.031
W-w-why don't you leave
the house?

40:30.701 --> 40:33.571
I haven't left the house
since Daddy died.

40:36.841 --> 40:40.477
Whenever I had a problem,
I could always ask Connie.

40:40.511 --> 40:42.178
Hmm...

40:42.212 --> 40:45.717
He always knew
how to handle any situation.

40:49.219 --> 40:52.023
How would he handle this one?

41:02.366 --> 41:04.200
Oh!!

41:05.636 --> 41:08.807
Ow!! Ow!!

41:20.718 --> 41:23.086
If you meant what you said
in there,

41:23.120 --> 41:24.787
then you have to trust me.

41:24.821 --> 41:26.423
I do.

41:26.457 --> 41:29.526
Then you have to jump.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.227
No!

41:31.261 --> 41:34.397
It'll be much safer
if you turn around.

41:34.431 --> 41:37.767
- I'm not... I'm not doing that.
- None of this would've happened

41:37.801 --> 41:40.471
if you would've just taken
the money!

41:43.440 --> 41:45.676
You're not like this.

41:45.710 --> 41:47.678
You have no idea
what I'm like.

41:47.712 --> 41:50.048
Ah!

42:21.745 --> 42:25.448
<i>You don't know me.</i>

42:25.482 --> 42:27.216
<i>Help me!</i>

42:27.250 --> 42:29.653
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- Hey! Shut up!

42:29.687 --> 42:31.555
Fuck, man.

42:31.589 --> 42:32.923
Fuck...

42:32.957 --> 42:34.624
Please help.

42:34.658 --> 42:36.392
Alright, fine.

42:36.426 --> 42:37.861
Fuckin' let me
take a look at it.

42:37.895 --> 42:41.466
Oh... Caref... Ow.

42:46.803 --> 42:49.673
Careful, careful... Ow.

42:49.707 --> 42:52.408
- Oh.
- What, is it bad?

42:52.442 --> 42:54.211
Fuck, it's bad.

42:54.245 --> 42:55.778
Kneecap's dislocated.

42:55.812 --> 42:57.815
Fuck.

43:00.817 --> 43:03.486
Okay...

43:03.520 --> 43:05.821
I'm gonna have to pop it
back into place

43:05.855 --> 43:09.258
before the swelling is too bad
I won't be able to, okay?

43:09.292 --> 43:11.495
- Dan.
- Huh?

43:12.830 --> 43:14.597
It's gonna hurt.

43:14.631 --> 43:16.233
Oh...

43:18.835 --> 43:20.604
JP.

43:20.638 --> 43:22.974
Hey! JP.

43:24.475 --> 43:26.945
Hold his body down.

43:31.848 --> 43:33.984
Hold him down here.

43:44.328 --> 43:46.463
Three, two...

43:56.873 --> 43:58.975
That was kinda fun.

44:05.049 --> 44:07.018
<i>You're alright.</i>

44:12.589 --> 44:14.323
Thank you.

44:14.357 --> 44:17.060
Whatever.

44:22.433 --> 44:24.600
Vance?

44:24.634 --> 44:26.035
Vance!

44:26.069 --> 44:28.738
- He's dead. Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, let it go.

44:28.772 --> 44:31.675
Let it go? We had her
until this shitheel showed up.

44:31.709 --> 44:33.843
I said we should do this
just us.

44:33.877 --> 44:36.747
You didn't want to.
I said take care of that bitch.

44:36.781 --> 44:38.414
You said no.

44:38.448 --> 44:40.316
Now we're stuck
in a fucking basement

44:40.350 --> 44:43.687
with one live piece of shit
and one dead one!

44:43.721 --> 44:46.455
Fuck you!
Get a hold of yourself.

44:46.489 --> 44:50.327
I'm a hold!
I'm a hold of my fucking self!

44:50.361 --> 44:53.430
Just re-evaluate your fucking
priorities, okay, JP?

44:53.464 --> 44:56.399
I'm not the one who's slipping.

44:58.736 --> 45:01.037
JP. JP!

45:01.071 --> 45:02.571
J...

45:02.605 --> 45:04.208
JP?

45:09.747 --> 45:11.481
- Are you okay?
- I...

45:11.515 --> 45:14.517
I... I need to go to a hospital.

45:14.551 --> 45:17.687
I can't... I can't take you
to the hospital.

45:17.721 --> 45:19.789
- No kidding.
- You can't even check

45:19.823 --> 45:21.925
your fucking mail,
you psycho bitch.

45:21.959 --> 45:24.461
- Don't call me that.
- What?

45:24.495 --> 45:26.863
Psycho, or bitch?

45:26.897 --> 45:29.098
We could all stop this.
Let's all stop, okay?

45:29.132 --> 45:30.934
Are you retarded?!

45:30.968 --> 45:34.104
She's not gonna come down here
and fucking save you, Dan!

45:34.138 --> 45:35.838
Can't you get him
under control?

45:35.872 --> 45:38.075
No one fucking controls me,
do you understand?!

45:38.109 --> 45:40.343
Okay...

45:40.377 --> 45:43.146
That's what you get!

45:44.582 --> 45:47.718
I'm cool. I'm okay, JP.

45:47.752 --> 45:49.385
Just breathe.

45:49.419 --> 45:52.388
There's a first-aid kit.

45:52.422 --> 45:55.492
- So go get it.
- No.

45:55.526 --> 45:57.928
- Down there.
- It's locked.

45:57.962 --> 46:00.030
Try again.

46:07.772 --> 46:10.775
Don't go anywhere.

46:25.556 --> 46:28.457
Oh, fuck!
Hey, open this stupid door!

46:28.491 --> 46:30.426
What's in there?

46:30.460 --> 46:33.162
What the fuck?!

46:35.732 --> 46:38.468
Ah...

46:38.502 --> 46:40.002
Perry!

46:40.036 --> 46:42.039
Goddamn!

46:56.587 --> 46:59.123
What the fuck?

47:33.256 --> 47:36.793
Fucking bitch!

47:47.837 --> 47:50.807
Get me outta here!

47:52.843 --> 47:54.477
Hello?

47:54.511 --> 47:56.513
Can you guys hear me?

47:56.547 --> 47:58.814
Yo, Perry, are you there?

47:58.848 --> 48:01.818
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- Oh...

48:01.852 --> 48:03.653
like what?

48:03.687 --> 48:05.789
Get him outta there.

48:05.823 --> 48:07.791
Get him outta there...

48:07.825 --> 48:10.827
Why didn't I think of that?

48:10.861 --> 48:13.696
I should've thought of that.
God, what a fucking idiot.

48:13.730 --> 48:15.698
What an idiot.
Okay, here we go.

48:15.732 --> 48:17.700
We're just gonna
get him outta there.

48:17.734 --> 48:20.003
You just stay seated,
you fucking cripple.

48:21.538 --> 48:23.840
JP, come on out!

48:25.709 --> 48:27.843
Come on, buddy. Huh.

48:27.877 --> 48:29.879
Quit fucking around.

48:29.913 --> 48:33.517
Get me the fuck outta here!

48:33.551 --> 48:35.184
The door seems to be locked.

48:35.218 --> 48:37.053
Do you remember
when that happened?

48:37.087 --> 48:38.821
- What's going on out there?!
- Forget it.

48:38.855 --> 48:40.624
Is that probably
when the door closed?

48:40.658 --> 48:44.026
Did you hear
the locking mechanism?

48:44.060 --> 48:45.995
Hmm...

48:57.040 --> 49:00.010
Yeah.

49:00.044 --> 49:02.546
This'll do.

49:02.580 --> 49:04.213
Come on, big fella.

49:04.247 --> 49:07.551
Goddamn, you fat fuck.

49:12.221 --> 49:14.723
What are you doing?

49:14.757 --> 49:18.596
Putting him in the doorway.
What's it look like?

49:19.763 --> 49:21.830
He's my friend.

49:21.864 --> 49:24.901
He was your friend.
Now, he's a doorstop.

49:26.703 --> 49:28.571
- Hmm?
- Ah...

49:28.605 --> 49:30.541
Fuck.

49:46.756 --> 49:49.225
Fuck you!

49:52.962 --> 49:54.931
Fuck.

50:29.667 --> 50:32.369
Hey... JP.

50:33.837 --> 50:36.138
We're gonna get you out.

50:36.172 --> 50:38.707
Perry's looking for something.

50:38.741 --> 50:40.809
He won't find anything.

50:42.779 --> 50:45.280
He might.

50:45.314 --> 50:49.152
Open it,
you fucking nutty cunt!

50:52.321 --> 50:55.458
Dan... listen to me.

50:58.127 --> 51:01.132
You know
she's not gonna let us go.

51:03.132 --> 51:04.968
Can you blame her?

51:05.002 --> 51:07.736
You were gonna kill her
an hour ago.

51:07.770 --> 51:09.972
Come on.

51:10.006 --> 51:12.309
I was just playing.

51:13.477 --> 51:15.980
Look where it got you.

51:21.151 --> 51:23.320
JP!

51:26.489 --> 51:28.992
She's gonna pay for it.

52:14.471 --> 52:16.507
Fuck this.

52:24.547 --> 52:26.950
JP?

52:26.984 --> 52:29.986
JP?

52:30.020 --> 52:33.124
JP, I think
I'm on the other side of you.

52:38.094 --> 52:40.897
Can you hear me?

52:40.931 --> 52:44.167
There's a fucking noose in here.

52:44.201 --> 52:46.070
Hey, Perry!

52:49.071 --> 52:51.074
Can you hear me?

52:59.950 --> 53:01.552
Fuck.

54:47.690 --> 54:49.524
Nice one.

55:41.277 --> 55:43.413
Hello?

55:45.348 --> 55:47.417
Anna?

55:51.288 --> 55:52.689
Hello?

55:52.723 --> 55:54.892
Anna?

56:12.676 --> 56:14.612
Hello?

56:31.460 --> 56:34.296
Is everything okay?

56:34.330 --> 56:36.064
Everything's fine.

56:36.098 --> 56:38.700
Are you okay?

56:38.734 --> 56:40.602
Just...

56:40.636 --> 56:43.641
just a little accident.

56:50.513 --> 56:53.549
Is that Dan's car out front?

57:06.830 --> 57:09.365
Oh!

57:09.399 --> 57:13.468
Dan came to check on me
because I wasn't at the funeral.

57:13.502 --> 57:16.472
So he broke in?

57:16.506 --> 57:18.341
I didn't answer the door,

57:18.375 --> 57:21.644
and he was worried
I was gonna do something bad.

57:21.678 --> 57:24.713
Is there something going on
between you two?

57:24.747 --> 57:27.182
- What? No.
- I knew there was something.

57:27.216 --> 57:29.618
I saw it the other day
when he came over.

57:29.652 --> 57:32.388
Well, I-I've just been so, um,

57:32.422 --> 57:35.191
lonely since Conrad got sick
and I...

57:35.225 --> 57:38.260
Oh, shhh. Honey, it's okay.

57:38.294 --> 57:42.365
Hey, you're going through
a rough time.

57:42.399 --> 57:46.202
You've done nothing wrong.

57:46.236 --> 57:50.106
And if you can't believe that,
you know what you need to do?

57:50.140 --> 57:52.075
No.

57:52.109 --> 57:54.510
Forgive yourself.

57:54.544 --> 57:57.680
Come here.

57:57.714 --> 58:00.816
I'll try.

58:17.701 --> 58:21.137
I'll call you in a few days
just to see how you're doing.

58:23.406 --> 58:25.776
That's nice, thanks.

58:29.546 --> 58:32.647
What is that?

58:37.587 --> 58:40.256
Radiator.

58:40.290 --> 58:42.459
Help!

58:43.660 --> 58:46.896
It's... an old house.

58:49.366 --> 58:53.170
Dan's taking a look at it
for me.

58:56.772 --> 58:58.740
Oh. So sweet.

58:58.774 --> 59:01.778
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

01:00:08.477 --> 01:00:11.147
You're in a lot of pain,
aren't you?

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:17.920
Come on, I'll help you.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.138
What'd you do?

01:00:40.944 --> 01:00:43.713
Have a seat.

01:00:45.714 --> 01:00:48.251
Now lift your legs up.

01:00:48.285 --> 01:00:50.554
- Please...
- Now.

01:00:57.727 --> 01:01:00.563
You'll understand soon.

01:01:43.939 --> 01:01:46.408
What the fuck?

01:01:46.442 --> 01:01:47.910
Fuck!

01:01:47.944 --> 01:01:50.379
Fuck! God!

01:01:50.413 --> 01:01:52.747
Argh! Girly-girl!

01:01:52.781 --> 01:01:56.452
You sneaky little fuck!

01:01:56.486 --> 01:01:58.255
Argh!

01:02:04.127 --> 01:02:06.461
Fuck!

01:02:06.495 --> 01:02:09.632
I didn't know you were invited,
Dan.

01:02:11.567 --> 01:02:13.636
Perry's dead.

01:02:15.971 --> 01:02:19.742
There's a body in the freezer.

01:02:19.776 --> 01:02:21.943
Yeah...
You could tell me

01:02:21.977 --> 01:02:25.113
there's a unicorn in the attic,
I wouldn't be surprised.

01:02:25.147 --> 01:02:27.615
What is this place?

01:02:27.649 --> 01:02:29.819
Fucked up, right?

01:02:31.687 --> 01:02:35.691
I mean, there's another one
like it upstairs.

01:02:35.725 --> 01:02:39.663
Why would you make...
the exact... bedroom?

01:02:47.002 --> 01:02:50.138
Are you back there, Anna?

01:02:50.172 --> 01:02:52.842
You watching us?

01:03:05.187 --> 01:03:06.821
Fu...

01:03:08.725 --> 01:03:10.926
We're your zoo animals now?
Huh?

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.697
You gonna observe us
in captivity?

01:03:16.732 --> 01:03:18.969
Fuck.

01:03:22.038 --> 01:03:24.106
<i>Argh!</i>

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:28.878
- Take it easy.
- Fuck!

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.983
<i>You can't break it.</i>

01:03:35.451 --> 01:03:37.887
<i>It's bulletproof.</i>

01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:39.688
You...

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:46.428
There's a shirt
in the dresser.

01:03:46.462 --> 01:03:48.197
<i>Put it on.</i>

01:03:52.768 --> 01:03:54.736
You know, something tells me

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:57.071
we're not your first guests
here.

01:03:57.105 --> 01:04:01.075
<i>You're sitting behind
your little desk, aren't you?</i>

01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:03.879
- <i>Huh?</i>
- No.

01:04:03.913 --> 01:04:06.080
<i>What's your game, huh?</i>

01:04:06.114 --> 01:04:09.618
<i>Who do you watch back there?</i>

01:04:09.652 --> 01:04:11.053
<i>What do you do?</i>

01:04:11.087 --> 01:04:12.787
Put on the shirt.

01:04:12.821 --> 01:04:14.756
What do you do, huh?

01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:16.591
Daddy issues?

01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:19.227
- <i>Just put on the shirt.</i>
- Or else what?

01:04:19.261 --> 01:04:22.997
- <i>Conrad will come.</i>
- Conrad's the dead guy?

01:04:23.031 --> 01:04:26.769
You're making it worse.

01:04:26.803 --> 01:04:29.205
Anna?

01:04:29.239 --> 01:04:32.207
Anna, please open the door.

01:04:32.241 --> 01:04:36.512
Not yet.
Not until he puts on the shirt.

01:04:39.815 --> 01:04:42.852
Fine! I'll put your shirt on.

01:04:42.886 --> 01:04:45.489
I'll play your game.

01:04:47.957 --> 01:04:50.658
<i>We're gonna figure this out,
Anna.</i>

01:04:50.692 --> 01:04:53.028
<i>You wanna start?</i>

01:04:53.062 --> 01:04:56.097
<i>No?!</i>

01:04:56.131 --> 01:04:59.135
Fine. I like puzzles.

01:05:00.636 --> 01:05:04.206
So you trap some poor fuck
in here...

01:05:07.843 --> 01:05:10.111
Conrad sneaks through here.

01:05:10.145 --> 01:05:12.280
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:05:12.314 --> 01:05:14.817
Fucking airlock?

01:05:16.152 --> 01:05:17.952
And he kills them.

01:05:17.986 --> 01:05:19.821
Hmm.

01:05:19.855 --> 01:05:21.122
Alright.

01:05:21.156 --> 01:05:23.559
Simple enough, right?

01:05:23.593 --> 01:05:25.528
Just stop.

01:05:25.562 --> 01:05:28.664
But if Conrad wants
to kill these guys,

01:05:28.698 --> 01:05:31.835
why's he put them in here first?

01:05:35.004 --> 01:05:37.240
So you could talk to them.

01:05:42.011 --> 01:05:43.979
I... I didn't talk to them.

01:05:44.013 --> 01:05:46.483
<i>So it's Conrad, then, huh?</i>

01:05:47.783 --> 01:05:49.318
What does he say?

01:05:49.352 --> 01:05:52.687
No, no, no, no, wrong question.

01:05:52.721 --> 01:05:55.591
What does he want from them?
That's the question.

01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:59.563
And what did he do when
he didn't get what he wants?

01:06:01.196 --> 01:06:03.332
Hey, you hungry?

01:06:05.368 --> 01:06:07.068
Fuck you.

01:06:07.102 --> 01:06:09.171
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

01:06:09.205 --> 01:06:11.006
No, no, no, no, no...

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.211
Perry said there's a noose
in the other room.

01:06:16.379 --> 01:06:19.714
You drugged their food.

01:06:19.748 --> 01:06:22.017
Then Conrad came in,

01:06:22.051 --> 01:06:25.354
drug them out...

01:06:25.388 --> 01:06:27.256
...and he strung them up.

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:28.756
Stop talking.

01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:30.825
<i>You know what?</i>

01:06:30.859 --> 01:06:33.829
<i>I hate to break it to you,
darling,</i>

01:06:33.863 --> 01:06:37.198
<i>but there's no one coming
through that door tonight.</i>

01:06:37.232 --> 01:06:39.734
- <i>Conrad's gone.</i>
- Shut up!

01:06:39.768 --> 01:06:42.137
You're twisting it around
and you're...

01:06:42.171 --> 01:06:44.238
<i>making it sound all wrong!</i>

01:06:44.272 --> 01:06:46.908
But... but it's true?

01:06:46.942 --> 01:06:50.447
You watched Conrad kill people?

01:07:08.964 --> 01:07:10.932
So what?

01:07:10.966 --> 01:07:13.001
Supposed to absolve you?

01:07:13.035 --> 01:07:14.236
Wh-wh-what is it?

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:16.940
They were killing perverts.

01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:23.678
<i>We weren't doing a bad thing.</i>

01:07:23.712 --> 01:07:25.948
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

01:07:25.982 --> 01:07:28.182
Murder's murder.

01:07:28.216 --> 01:07:29.952
No! We were fixing them!

01:07:29.986 --> 01:07:31.419
<i>Is that
what you'd tell yourselves?</i>

01:07:31.453 --> 01:07:34.356
<i>It's the truth!
They needed our help.</i>

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:37.292
<i>They were sick,
just like Daddy was.</i>

01:07:37.326 --> 01:07:40.262
<i>He said he loved me all along,</i>

01:07:40.296 --> 01:07:44.300
<i>but... that didn't stop him
from doing what he did to me.</i>

01:07:45.902 --> 01:07:47.903
It wasn't so bad after a while,

01:07:47.937 --> 01:07:51.906
'cause he would hold me
afterwards and...

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:55.109
Conrad stopped him?

01:07:55.143 --> 01:07:56.979
<i>Yeah, he saved me.</i>

01:07:57.013 --> 01:07:59.448
<i>He wrapped the sheet
around father's neck</i>

01:07:59.482 --> 01:08:03.017
<i>and he pulled it so tight!</i>

01:08:03.051 --> 01:08:07.122
When it was all over,
Connie looked at me and I knew.

01:08:07.156 --> 01:08:09.825
I knew he would never hurt me.

01:08:09.859 --> 01:08:12.060
That he loved me.

01:08:12.094 --> 01:08:15.331
That's when you stopped
leaving the house, yeah?

01:08:17.099 --> 01:08:18.734
<i>And he built this room</i>

01:08:18.768 --> 01:08:22.136
<i>to punish fucking pedophiles
like your dad.</i>

01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:26.274
Ah, I saw some twisted
fucking shit, but this...

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:30.078
Pfft, you must be really proud
of yourself.

01:08:30.112 --> 01:08:32.479
No, I would've stopped,
but they didn't show me

01:08:32.514 --> 01:08:34.917
- they were sorry!
- <i>How would they do that?</i>

01:08:34.951 --> 01:08:38.020
Buy you flowers?

01:08:38.054 --> 01:08:41.488
Dear Anna,
so sorry to let you down.

01:08:41.523 --> 01:08:44.859
<i>- Yours truly, your stand-in dad.
- Stop.</i>

01:08:44.894 --> 01:08:47.863
<i>So pleased I got to join you
in your beautiful basement</i>

01:08:47.897 --> 01:08:50.031
<i>so we could help you erase
the feeling</i>

01:08:50.064 --> 01:08:51.800
<i>of Daddy between your legs.</i>

01:08:51.834 --> 01:08:54.301
- Stop...
- <i>Your brother was a sick fuck!</i>

01:08:54.336 --> 01:08:56.404
He got his rocks off
killing your dad,

01:08:56.438 --> 01:08:59.341
and he wanted to relive
the moment over and over again.

01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:01.142
<i>- That's not true.
- Little crazy sister,</i>

01:09:01.176 --> 01:09:03.412
<i>little Anna, too scared
to leave, too dumb...</i>

01:09:03.446 --> 01:09:05.513
- No!
- <i>Shut the fuck up! Just stop!</i>

01:09:05.546 --> 01:09:07.348
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.

01:09:07.381 --> 01:09:10.453
Sorry to mess with your girl.

01:09:28.938 --> 01:09:30.203
Dan.

01:09:30.238 --> 01:09:32.038
Hmm...?

01:09:32.073 --> 01:09:34.411
Come to the mirror.

01:09:46.956 --> 01:09:48.791
What do you want?

01:09:48.825 --> 01:09:50.559
I want him to pay.

01:09:50.593 --> 01:09:52.560
<i>Oh...</i>

01:09:52.595 --> 01:09:55.897
<i>Okay, he's dead, Anna.</i>

01:09:55.931 --> 01:09:59.501
Okay?
He's been dead for a long time.

01:09:59.535 --> 01:10:01.436
No.

01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:03.673
Him.

01:10:12.982 --> 01:10:14.348
Do it.

01:10:14.382 --> 01:10:17.586
Do what now?

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.288
<i>I'll let you go.</i>

01:10:19.322 --> 01:10:21.422
No.

01:10:21.456 --> 01:10:23.460
<i>Please?</i>

01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:26.528
I'm not like them.

01:10:26.562 --> 01:10:28.498
Just do it!

01:10:30.265 --> 01:10:32.534
Now dammit, Dan!

01:10:38.174 --> 01:10:39.842
<i>This is how?</i>

01:10:42.144 --> 01:10:45.480
This is how they show you
they're sorry?

01:10:45.514 --> 01:10:47.983
So much regret,

01:10:48.017 --> 01:10:50.284
so much remorse,

01:10:50.318 --> 01:10:52.287
that they just...

01:10:52.321 --> 01:10:55.289
bang.

01:10:55.323 --> 01:10:57.993
They were supposed
to take responsibility

01:10:58.027 --> 01:11:01.096
for what they did!
Just like you.

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:04.266
<i>Don't you feel sorry
for what you did?</i>

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.935
Big brothers are supposed to
protect their younger siblings,

01:11:06.969 --> 01:11:09.238
which is more than you did
for Vance.

01:11:09.272 --> 01:11:11.873
- <i>Stop talking about him.</i>
- You know it's your fault!

01:11:11.907 --> 01:11:14.543
- <i>Shut your mouth.</i>
- You knew he looked up to you.

01:11:14.577 --> 01:11:17.178
<i>You ever wonder if things
would've turned out differently</i>

01:11:17.212 --> 01:11:18.480
<i>if only...</i>

01:11:18.514 --> 01:11:20.414
I know
what you're trying to do.

01:11:20.448 --> 01:11:23.651
It doesn't change the truth.
I could let you go right now,

01:11:23.685 --> 01:11:27.657
<i>and there's nowhere you could go
to get away from what you did.</i>

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:43.539
I'm sorry!

01:11:45.707 --> 01:11:47.409
<i>Good.</i>

01:11:47.443 --> 01:11:50.212
That's good. Now... now show me.

01:11:57.553 --> 01:12:01.088
- Oh...
- <i>Show me you're sorry.</i>

01:12:01.122 --> 01:12:02.858
Show me.

01:12:14.103 --> 01:12:17.038
<i>You think I'm that weak?</i>

01:12:20.608 --> 01:12:23.345
I'd live a thousand years
with this on my shoulders

01:12:23.379 --> 01:12:25.414
before I pull this trigger.

01:12:27.416 --> 01:12:30.587
<i>You will... eventually.</i>

01:12:35.657 --> 01:12:37.726
One bullet for one man.

01:12:39.627 --> 01:12:41.898
No!

01:12:43.366 --> 01:12:47.002
What... what...
what are you doing?

01:12:47.036 --> 01:12:50.504
I found my way out.

01:12:50.538 --> 01:12:52.306
<i>You killed Vance,</i>

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.643
<i>- you killed Perry...
- Fuck.</i>

01:12:56.144 --> 01:12:59.213
<i>But you're still alive, Dan.</i>

01:12:59.247 --> 01:13:00.582
That doesn't mean anything!

01:13:00.616 --> 01:13:03.217
Ah, let's see.

01:13:06.688 --> 01:13:10.292
- <i>Argh...!</i>
- Mm! Please.

01:13:10.326 --> 01:13:12.627
No, no! Please stop!

01:13:12.661 --> 01:13:14.730
Please don't hurt him.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.484
Fuck.

01:13:36.352 --> 01:13:37.819
Come on.

01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:49.025
Alright, brother, come on.

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:10.380
No.

01:15:34.636 --> 01:15:37.771
Fucking...
burn this house down.

01:15:37.805 --> 01:15:40.441
Burn his fucking memories.

01:15:40.475 --> 01:15:43.712
Burn his fucking
fucked-up family.

01:15:43.746 --> 01:15:46.614
Ah!

01:15:46.648 --> 01:15:48.917
...all fucking locked up.

01:15:48.951 --> 01:15:50.619
I let you go.

01:15:50.653 --> 01:15:53.187
Uh, yeah,
guess that was a mistake.

01:15:53.221 --> 01:15:54.788
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

01:15:54.822 --> 01:15:58.325
It was.
Now I just wanna see you burn.

01:16:07.603 --> 01:16:10.538
Argh!! Fuck!

01:16:10.572 --> 01:16:12.073
Fuck!

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.050
Bitch.

01:16:22.818 --> 01:16:24.686
Huh? C'mere.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.954
C'mere. C'mon.

01:16:26.988 --> 01:16:28.789
Ah!!

01:16:28.823 --> 01:16:31.325
Ah!!! Ah!

01:16:31.359 --> 01:16:33.294
I've got an idea.

01:16:33.328 --> 01:16:35.297
Ah! Ah!

01:16:35.331 --> 01:16:37.567
Ah! No!

01:16:41.737 --> 01:16:43.404
Don't!

01:16:43.438 --> 01:16:44.905
No!

01:16:44.939 --> 01:16:47.876
Don't! Ah!

01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:49.945
Ah!!

01:16:51.846 --> 01:16:55.251
One last walk
down memory lane.

01:16:57.653 --> 01:17:03.592
Hold still! I'll give it to you
like Daddy did, just like Papa.

01:17:03.626 --> 01:17:07.529
Be a good little girl.
It'll be over soon.

01:17:07.563 --> 01:17:10.565
Hold still, Daddy's little girl.
Little angel.

01:17:10.599 --> 01:17:13.301
Yeah, that's it, just lie there,

01:17:13.335 --> 01:17:15.537
you broken little bitch.

01:17:15.571 --> 01:17:16.671
Hey! Stop!

01:17:16.705 --> 01:17:20.441
Ah! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:17:20.475 --> 01:17:22.545
Stop! Stop!

01:17:24.712 --> 01:17:27.916
This won't bring Vance back!

01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:29.950
No more killing.

01:18:03.452 --> 01:18:05.588
I forgive you.
