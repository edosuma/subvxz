WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:02.469
(screams) Y ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.503 --> 00:04.438
(Emily) WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
 MY FATHER WAS FRAMED

00:04.471 --> 00:06.340
FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.808
AMANDA!

00:07.841 --> 00:09.377
AMANDA CLARKE
NO LONGER EXISTS.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.413
BEFORE HE DIED,
 HE LEFT A ROAD MAP FOR REVENGE

00:12.446 --> 00:14.548
THAT LED ME TO THE PEOPLE
 WHO DESTROYED OUR LIVES.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.817
(Nolan) THE GRAYSON FAMILY
IS DECIMATED.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.152
(Emily) I'M STARTING TO SEE
THE LIGHT

00:18.186 --> 00:19.220
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.554
(Daniel) JACK CAME BY HERE
YESTERDAY, DIDN'T HE?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.256
DID YOU KISS HIM?

00:22.290 --> 00:24.525
YES.

00:24.558 --> 00:25.826
BYE, EMILY.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.128
JACK AND I ARE GONNA HAVE
A BABY.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.064
And who are you?

00:30.098 --> 00:30.831
YOU MURDERED MY FATHER.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.366
IF YOU BOARD THAT PLANE...

00:32.400 --> 00:34.068
(whispers) IT'S GONNA BE
THE LAST THING THAT YOU DO.

00:34.102 --> 00:38.139
THE GOVERNMENT-CHARTERED JET
 EXPLODED SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.141
CHARLOTTE! CHARLOTTE!
CHARLOTTE!

00:40.174 --> 00:42.110
(voice breaking) EVERYTHING THAT
COULD'VE EXONERATED MY FATHER

00:42.143 --> 00:44.245
WASNOT EXACTLY.NE.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.379
THERE'S MUCH MORE
 TO THE STORY.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.814
(Emily) WHAT IS SHE SAYING?

00:46.847 --> 00:49.383
YOUR MOTHER'S ALIVE.

00:51.119 --> 00:54.122
(water gurgling)

00:57.591 --> 01:01.829
(muffled sound of
helicopter blades whirring)

01:01.862 --> 01:04.432
(man over radio)
Sonar has picked up wreckage

01:04.465 --> 01:05.866
at 46 meters.

01:05.899 --> 01:06.834
(man, amplified voice)
ROGER THAT.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.170
WE'LL CONTINUE SURFACE SWEEP
FOR SURVIVORS.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.571
(water splashes)

01:10.604 --> 01:13.407
(helicopter blades
continue whirring)

01:13.441 --> 01:16.377
(Emily) DESTINY...

01:16.410 --> 01:20.514
TO BELIEVE THAT A LIFE
 IS MEANT FOR A SINGLE PURPOSE,

01:20.548 --> 01:23.117
ONE MUST ALSO BELIEVE
 IN A COMMON FATE.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.618
(man) We have
a visual on the vessel.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.220
(man) Roger that.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.855
FATHER TO DAUGHTER,

01:27.888 --> 01:31.259
BROTHER TO SISTER,
 MOTHER TO CHILD,

01:31.292 --> 01:35.529
BLOOD TIES CAN BE AS UNYIELDING
 AS THEY ARE ETERNAL.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.866
Looks like some kind of fire
or explosion brought her down.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.669
This wasn't an accident.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.571
BUT IT IS OUR BONDS OF CHOICE

01:43.604 --> 01:46.540
THAT TRULY LIGHT
 THE ROAD WE TRAVEL--

01:46.574 --> 01:48.409
LOVE VERSUS HATRED...

01:48.442 --> 01:51.412
LOYALTY AGAINST BETRAYAL.

02:00.921 --> 02:04.124
We got a body. Have the captain
radio the coroner.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.161
A PERSON'S TRUE DESTINY

02:07.195 --> 02:10.231
CAN ONLY BE REVEALED
 AT THE END OF HIS JOURNEY.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.936
(helicopter blades
continue whirring)

02:15.969 --> 02:19.407
AND THE STORY I HAVE TO TELL...

02:19.440 --> 02:22.176
IS FAR FROM OVER.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.187
(gasps)

02:33.221 --> 02:35.155
(coughs and pants)

02:38.259 --> 02:41.462
IT IS NOT THE ROPES
THAT BIND HER.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.331
IT IS HER FEAR.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.600
(British accent)
SHE'S NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.637
(speaking Japanese)

03:07.255 --> 03:10.524
I THOUGHT I MIGHT
FIND YOU IN HERE.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.493
SORRY. I SHOULD'VE KNOCKED.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.329
IT'S OKAY.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.964
GONNA TAKE
SOME GETTING USED TO,

03:16.997 --> 03:18.566
HER NOT BEING HERE.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.535
(Ashley) AND YET EVERYWHERE,
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.606
THIS ROOM
WAS HER SANCTUARY.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.375
I'LL TELL THE STAFF
THAT IT'S OFF-LIMITS

03:27.408 --> 03:30.578
AND TO LEAVE EVERYTHING
AS IS.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.013
NO. NO, NOTHING GOOD COMES
FROM DWELLING IN THE PAST.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.516
LET'S JUST MOVE FORWARD
THIS SUMMER,

03:35.549 --> 03:37.585
LIKE WE PROMISED.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.254
OKAY.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.323
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME SPACE.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.264
(seagulls crying in distance)

04:04.678 --> 04:07.748
(boat creaks)

04:07.781 --> 04:09.283
(Declan) JACK!

04:09.317 --> 04:10.284
YOU DOWN HERE?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.019
YEAH.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.322
WELL, THE HEALTH INSPECTOR'S
COMING IN A HALF AN HOUR.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.289
MM. OKAY.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.423
WHEW.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.558
I'LL BE THERE.
I'LL BE THERE.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.027
(sniffs) LOOKS LIKE
YOU THREW YOURSELF

04:20.060 --> 04:22.530
ONE HELL OF A PITY PARTY
LAST NIGHT.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.299
WATCH IT.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.434
I AM WATCHING IT.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.569
I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.372
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE
AMANDA CAME BACK,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.441
YOU HAVE BEEN PUSHING
FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.310
(Amanda) READY, JACK?
(grunts)

04:36.344 --> 04:37.511
OUR 10:00 PRENATAL?

04:37.545 --> 04:38.679
HOLD ON, AMANDA.
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.682
RIGHT. UH, I...

04:41.715 --> 04:42.650
DEC.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.353
OH, YEAH, SURE.
I'LL GO SEE IF I CAN PUSH

04:45.386 --> 04:47.888
THE HEALTH INSPECTOR
TILL LATER. EXCUSE ME.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.759
FOURTH NIGHT IN A ROW
YOU SPENT OUT HERE.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.561
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:53.594 --> 04:56.397
NOTHING. I JUST, UH...
I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING WELL.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.866
DIDN'T WANT TO DRAG YOU
INTO MY INSOMNIA.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.335
YOU NEED YOUR REST.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.103
WHAT I NEED IS YOU, JACK.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.071
DON'T WORRY.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.540
ONCE THE BABY COMES,
THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.413
HEY...

05:16.517 --> 05:18.419
IN ALL THE TIME
YOU'VE KNOWN ME,

05:18.452 --> 05:20.554
HAVE I EVER BROKEN
A PROMISE TO YOU?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.861
TODAY MARKS CHARLOTTE'S
60th DAY OF SOBER LIVING.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.663
CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.366
CHARLOTTE ALWAYS WAS
AN OVERACHIEVER.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.835
JUST LIKE MY MOTHER.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.571
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.740
WELL, IN LIGHT
OF YOUR DAUGHTER'S

05:39.773 --> 05:41.375
CLEAR COMMITMENT
TO HER RECOVERY,

05:41.409 --> 05:42.643
I'M RECOMMENDING WE MOVE AHEAD
WITH HER TRANSITION

05:42.676 --> 05:44.478
TO OUTPATIENT CARE
NEXT WEEK.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.114
I WAS HOPING TO BE OUT
IN TIME FOR MEMORIAL DAY.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.450
THERE'S AN ART AUCTION
MY MOTHER USED TO SPONSOR

05:49.483 --> 05:51.685
AT THE START OF EVERY SEASON.
I'D LIKE TO BE THERE.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.120
I DON'T KNOW, SWEETHEART.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.388
THAT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH,
TOO SOON.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.523
DON'T YOU THINK, DOCTOR?

05:55.556 --> 05:56.657
WHAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH

05:56.690 --> 05:59.793
IS LOSING A SECOND CHANCE
TO HONOR HER.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.395
I ALREADY MISSED
MOM'S FUNERAL.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.431
DON'T TAKE THIS
AWAY FROM ME, TOO.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.599
I HAVE NEVER TAKEN
A SINGLE THING AWAY FROM YOU.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.767
YOU KNOW THAT.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.901
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.403
WHY DON'T WE STICK
WITH THE TIMETABLE,

06:09.437 --> 06:11.439
AND I'LL ESCORT YOU
TO THE PARTY?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.173
THANKS, DR. THOMAS.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.677
YES, DOCTOR,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.992
(girl's muffled laughter)

06:34.227 --> 06:35.829
(girl) MARCO!

06:35.863 --> 06:37.465
(woman) POLO!

06:39.232 --> 06:40.768
MARCO!

06:40.801 --> 06:42.903
POLO!

06:42.936 --> 06:44.204
MARCO!

06:44.237 --> 06:45.573
POLO!

06:45.606 --> 06:46.874
MARCO!

06:46.907 --> 06:48.942
(laughs)

06:48.976 --> 06:50.544
MARCO!

06:50.578 --> 06:52.846
(squeals)

06:54.482 --> 07:01.489
(voice echoing)
LET'S PLAY AGAIN.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.957
I FOUND YOU, MOMMY!

07:13.967 --> 07:16.970
MOMMY?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.642
WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?

07:25.546 --> 07:29.049
MOMMY,
 WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?

07:38.526 --> 07:40.460
(grunts)

07:51.939 --> 07:54.942
(coughing)

07:57.277 --> 07:58.912
GET OFF ME.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

07:58.946 --> 08:02.015
NOBODY ASKED YOU TO DO THAT.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.917
(pants) I WAS THIS CLOSE

08:03.951 --> 08:05.919
TO UNLOCKING A MEMORY
ABOUT MY MOTHER.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.522
HAD I KNOWN
THAT WAS YOUR INTENTION,

08:08.556 --> 08:10.858
I WOULDN'T HAVE WELCOMED
YOUR RETURN TO TRAINING.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.526
AMANDA...

08:12.560 --> 08:13.927
DON'T CALL ME THAT.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.529
LOOK,
I AM NOT THE ENEMY.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.598
PLEASE. (grunts)

08:17.631 --> 08:18.899
TRUST ME. (grunts)

08:18.932 --> 08:20.934
(blade whooshes)

08:20.968 --> 08:22.770
I ALREADY
MADE THAT MISTAKE ONCE.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.672
(Takeda)
YOU'VE ALREADY FAILED

08:24.705 --> 08:26.607
TO KILL THE MURDERER
OF YOUR FATHER.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.975
(exhales)

08:28.008 --> 08:29.910
WHO'S TO SAY HE WON'T
COME FOR YOU AGAIN?

08:29.943 --> 08:32.645
I'M COUNTING ON IT, TAKEDA.
(pants)

08:32.679 --> 08:34.047
HE MIGHT BE
THE ONLY PERSON LEFT

08:34.081 --> 08:35.649
WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.818
YOU WOULD THROW AWAY
YOUR TRAINING

08:37.851 --> 08:40.821
ON THE UNSUPPORTED ASSUMPTION
THAT YOUR MOTHER REMAINS ALIVE.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.823
DEAD OR ALIVE, I'M GONNA
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.658
AND WHEN I DO...

08:44.692 --> 08:47.628
GOD HELP THE PEOPLE
WHO KEPT ME FROM HER,

08:47.661 --> 08:49.563
AND THAT INCLUDES YOU.

09:12.886 --> 09:18.992
***

09:19.026 --> 09:21.662
AND TIME!

09:21.695 --> 09:22.930
GO GOOD AROUND, SOTHANKS.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.031
ALL RIGHT. TOMORROW?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.999
YEAOKAY.ACH.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.034
(man grunting)

09:27.067 --> 09:29.069
(Emily) "SOUTHPAW," IS IT?

09:29.102 --> 09:31.972
***

09:33.774 --> 09:36.043
"BRUISER" WAS ALREADY TAKEN,
SO...

09:36.076 --> 09:37.010
AS YOU KNOW,
I BRUISE EASILY.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.646
ALWAYS THINKIN'.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.147
HELLO, NOLAN.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.016
EMS...
WHERE THE HELL YOU BEEN?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.152
REGROUPING.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.920
REALLY?

09:46.954 --> 09:50.658
EIGHT WEEKS, NO WORD.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.025
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK
I'D NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.895
SO... BOXING.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.063
I'M IMPRESSED.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.931
AND WEIGHT TRAINING

09:57.965 --> 10:00.067
AND KARATE.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.936
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN A WHITE-HAIRED MANIAC'S

10:02.970 --> 10:06.039
GONNA POP OUT OF THE SHADOWS
WITH A KNIFE OR GUN

10:06.073 --> 10:08.041
OR SHOE BOMB.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.010
UNLESS...

10:10.043 --> 10:12.646
YOU DIDN'T GO FINISH
THE JOB, DID YOU?

10:12.680 --> 10:14.648
MY PRIORITIES HAVE SHIFTED.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.784
YOU WANT TO GO FOR A DRIVE?

10:16.817 --> 10:19.019
SOUNDS VAGUELY REVENGE-Y.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.788
WHERE TO?

10:20.821 --> 10:23.190
BACK TO THE HAMPTONS.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.832
SO TAKEDA WAS BEHIND
AMANDA'S RETURN,

10:31.865 --> 10:33.734
BABY BUMP INCLUDED?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.102
KIDDING.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.772
HE CLAIMS HE WAS TRAINING HER
TO BE MY ALLY.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.074
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "CLAIMS"?

10:41.108 --> 10:44.011
YOU STILL TRUST HIM,
DON'T YOU?

10:44.044 --> 10:46.714
UNTIL I FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER,

10:46.747 --> 10:48.115
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.750
WELL, AT LEAST YOU CAN CROSS
THE GRAYSONS OFF

10:49.783 --> 10:51.118
YOUR TO-SCREW LIST.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.120
CONRAD'S BEEN BURIED
UNDER A CLOUD OF SUSPICION

10:53.153 --> 10:56.089
EVER SINCE VICTORIA'S
PLANE CRASH DESTROYED

10:56.123 --> 10:58.091
ALL THE S.E.C. EVIDENCE
AGAINST HIM.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.727
NOT QUITE.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.094
(typing on keyboard)

11:01.128 --> 11:02.696
EMS...

11:02.730 --> 11:04.765
HOW MANY GUEST ROOMS
DO YOU HAVE?

11:04.798 --> 11:05.799
WHY?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.935
WELL,
CASA NOLAN'S IN ESCROW.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.937
WAIT.
YOU SOLD YOUR HOUSE?

11:09.970 --> 11:12.072
BAD MOJO.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.173
IF...

11:13.206 --> 11:14.942
(continues typing)

11:14.975 --> 11:16.443
IF I'M GONNA BE YOUR WINGMAN
THIS SUMMER--

11:16.476 --> 11:18.011
NO.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.112
GEE.

11:19.146 --> 11:22.182
THANKS FOR MULLING THAT OVER.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.724
WHAT'S THIS?

11:30.758 --> 11:33.126
I REMEMBERED SOMETHING,
NOLAN.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.728
ANGEL OF MERCY HOSPITAL?

11:34.762 --> 11:37.831
IT'S 25 MILES NORTH
OF WHERE MY PARENTS GREW UP.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.868
"THE EMPLOYEES SHOWED UP
TO FIND THE DOORS BOLTED

11:40.901 --> 11:43.203
AND ALL THE PATIENTS
HAD BEEN REASSIGNED."

11:43.236 --> 11:45.205
A DUMMY INVESTMENT GROUP
BOUGHT IT AND SHUT IT DOWN

11:45.238 --> 11:46.840
IN AUGUST OF '93--

11:46.874 --> 11:51.511
ONLY TWO DAYS
AFTER MY FATHER WAS ARRESTED.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.982
AND THE PLOT CURDLES.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.984
***

11:57.017 --> 11:58.852
(Declan) HEY, JACK.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.021
CHECK OUT THE NEW SIGNAGE.

12:01.054 --> 12:01.955
"CLOSED BY ORDER OF

12:01.989 --> 12:03.123
THE COMMISSION
OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH."

12:03.156 --> 12:05.158
I THOUGHT YOU MOVED IT.N.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.160
APPARENTLY, IF WE WANT
TO BE OPEN BY MEMORIAL DAY,

12:07.194 --> 12:08.128
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE,

12:08.161 --> 12:09.897
WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW
IF YOU KEPT YOUR PHONE ON.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.232
I LEFT IT ON THE BOAT.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

12:12.265 --> 12:13.901
YOU KNOW THE GREASE SPOTS
IN THE KITCHEN?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.035
TURNS OUT IT'S WATER DAMAGE

12:15.068 --> 12:16.937
FROM THE 65-YEAR-OLD GALVANIZED
PIPES INSIDE OUR WALLS.

12:16.970 --> 12:17.938
(Amanda) GROSS.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.873
YEAH, IT'S A PRETTY TOXIC PLACE
TO RAISE A KID.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.141
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.242
WITH WHAT, JACK?

12:22.275 --> 12:23.877
YOU GONNA
SELL YOUR BOAT AGAIN,

12:23.911 --> 12:26.947
OR SHOULD I DONATE THE MONEY
I SAVED FOR COLLEGE?

12:28.916 --> 12:31.919
(Ashley) DON'T FORGET TO LET
BARRY SAUNDERS KNOW

12:31.952 --> 12:34.287
THAT GLENN GISSLER IS POISED
TO GET THE REDECORATING GIG

12:34.321 --> 12:36.056
AND VICE VERSA.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.225
IF WE CAN PIT THOSE TWO
AGAINST EACH OTHER--

12:38.258 --> 12:40.794
IT PRACTICALLY GUARANTEES
A "DIGEST" COVER.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.195
YOU'RE SO BOSS-SOME.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.198
DON'T SAY THAT.
AND MAKE SURE THAT IS CHUCKED

12:45.232 --> 12:47.200
BEFORE EITHER OF THEM
COME TO VIEW THE PLACE.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.101
AND LET ME KNOW THE INSTANT

12:48.135 --> 12:49.937
YOU GET THE APPRAISALS
ON THE ARTWORK.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.171
THE PIECE WITH
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF VALUE

12:51.204 --> 12:53.206
IS GOING UP
FOR THE MEMORIAL DAY AUCTION.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.175
I'VE SAVED YOU THE TROUBLE.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.276
I'M ALREADY HAVING
THE PIECE FOR THE AUCTION

12:56.309 --> 12:57.911
CRATED AND DELIVERED,

12:57.945 --> 12:59.346
AND I THINK YOU WILL FIND IT
REMARKABLY SUITABLE

12:59.379 --> 13:01.081
FOR THE OCCASION.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.216
I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU'LL
WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS

13:03.250 --> 13:04.217
AT THE MEMORIAL.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.119
YOU KNOW, I'D RATHER NOT
SPEAK ILL OF THE DEAD,

13:06.153 --> 13:07.087
IN PUBLIC ANYWAY.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.889
SO LET'S JUST SKIP
THE EULOGIES, SHALL WE?

13:08.922 --> 13:10.157
IS DANIEL HOME?

13:10.190 --> 13:13.160
MEASURING YOUR STUDY,
I BELIEVE.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.263
(Conrad)
OOH, IS IT 5:00 ALREADY?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.099
SOMEWHERE,
JUST LIKE YOU TAUGHT ME.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.167
(chuckles)

13:20.200 --> 13:23.236
YEAH, WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU DO
HAVE CAUSE TO CELEBRATE,

13:23.270 --> 13:24.838
'CAUSE I'M LIFTING
THE CONTINGENCIES

13:24.872 --> 13:26.106
ON YOUR TRUST FUND.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.207
OH, REALLY?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.342
YEAH, WITH A SMALL CAVEAT,
OF COURSE.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.211
THAT YOU INVEST IT ALL
IN THE COMPANY

13:31.244 --> 13:34.081
ALONG WITH YOUR SHARE
OF YOUR MOTHER'S INHERITANCE.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.583
OR I COULD JUST
SET IT ALL ON FIRE.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.251
(chuckles)

13:38.285 --> 13:41.021
AH, IT'S NOT A JOKE, SON.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.923
YOU NEED TO SEND
A MESSAGE TO THE COMMUNITY.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.058
WHAT, THAT WE'RE WILLING TO
THROW GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD?

13:45.092 --> 13:48.328
NO, THAT WE'RE STILL
WILLING TO BET ON OURSELVES.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.364
LOOK...

13:51.398 --> 13:53.266
EVERY RED CENT
OF THIS FAMILY'S NET WORTH

13:53.300 --> 13:57.337
WAS EARNED BY MAKING BOLD
AND CALCULATED RISKS.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.240
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS,

14:00.273 --> 14:03.877
THOSE VENTURES HAVE PAID OFF
IN SPADES.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.613
OH, I THINK MOM MIGHT HAVE
A DIFFERENT OPINION ABOUT THAT.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.982
BECAUSE DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY,

14:09.016 --> 14:11.284
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER...

14:11.318 --> 14:13.386
THAT'S ON BOTH OF US.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.256
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN RICH OR POOR,

14:16.289 --> 14:18.358
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LIVE WITH
THAT FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.994
I, FOR ONE,
PREFER THE FORMER.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.197
DANIEL, NOT SO LONG AGO,

14:24.231 --> 14:27.234
YOU PLEDGED YOUR ALLEGIANCE
TO ME IN FRONT OF YOUR MOTHER,

14:27.267 --> 14:29.369
YOUR SISTER,
AND--AND--AND THE ENTIRE WORLD.

14:29.402 --> 14:34.274
NOW... NOW'S THE TIME FOR YOU
TO MAKE GOOD ON THAT PROMISE.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.677
(sighs)

14:37.710 --> 14:39.279
I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT.

14:39.312 --> 14:44.017
THAT'S GOOD.
YEAH, I WANT YOU TO.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.693
(thud)

14:53.726 --> 14:55.362
(clank)

14:55.395 --> 14:57.130
(door creaks)

15:01.101 --> 15:02.402
(flashlight clicks)

15:02.435 --> 15:04.437
HMM.

15:09.176 --> 15:13.180
ALL THAT'S MISSING
ARE THE FLESH-EATING ZOMBIES.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.115
WHERE DO WE START?

15:17.017 --> 15:21.188
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND HER FILE--
KARA WALLACE CLARKE.

15:21.221 --> 15:25.092
UNDER "WALLACE CLARKE"...

15:25.125 --> 15:26.526
"CLARKE WALLACE"?

16:04.331 --> 16:06.066
(man) THE RESTRAINTS ARE
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION, KARA.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.267
MOMMY?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.069
AMANDA?

16:09.102 --> 16:13.340
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.774
HI, SWEETIE. COME HERE, BABY.
IT'S OKAY.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.309
UNLOCK MY ARMS.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.444
I WANT TO HOLD MY DAUGHTER.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.745
MOMMY!

16:18.778 --> 16:20.180
I WANNA HOLD MY DAUGHTER!

16:20.213 --> 16:22.449
CO MOMMY! E!

16:55.615 --> 16:57.584
(Nolan) EMS.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.220
I FOUND THE VISITOR LOG.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.155
LOOK.

17:02.189 --> 17:06.126
YOUR FATHER CAME TO SEE HER
THE WEEK HE WAS ARRESTED.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.061
AND BEFORE THAT,

17:09.096 --> 17:12.432
A WOMAN
NAMED CHARLOTTE CLARKE.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.665
NO, THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

17:13.700 --> 17:18.070
AUNT CHARLOTTE HAD PARKINSON'S.
SHE WAS AN INVALID BY THEN.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.540
WELL, THEN WHO?

17:21.840 --> 17:23.609
WHO ELSE?

17:25.612 --> 17:27.480
VICTORIA.

17:27.513 --> 17:30.083
(scoffs) GREAT.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.519
SEANCE, ANYONE?

17:39.359 --> 17:40.593
(Nolan) IT'S VICTORIA'S
HANDWRITING ALL RIGHT.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.329
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TRY
AND DISGUISE IT.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.563
MUST HAVE BEEN IN A HURRY.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.633
YEAH, BUT THE QUESTION IS--
WHAT DID SHE DO TO MY MOTHER,

17:46.666 --> 17:49.369
ABDUCT HER...

17:49.402 --> 17:50.603
OR WORSE?

17:50.637 --> 17:53.273
AND RISK GETTING
HER MANICURED TALONS DIRTY?

17:53.306 --> 17:56.109
NOT HER STYLE.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.879
(taps keys)

17:59.912 --> 18:00.880
YOU LOOK A LITTLE DEEPER,

18:00.913 --> 18:02.615
AND YOU'LL FIND THERE'S
 MUCH MORE TO THE STORY.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.284
OY. AGAISHH.TH THIS?

18:04.317 --> 18:05.652
(White-haired Man) MEANING?

18:05.685 --> 18:07.520
DAVID TOLD ME THAT HIS WIFE
 WAS NO LONGER WITH HIM,

18:07.554 --> 18:09.889
WHICH IS TECHNICALLY TRUE.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.658
BUT SHE ISN'T DEAD.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.892
FAR FROM IT.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.527
(Conrad)
 SO WHY WOULD HE LEAD EVERYONE

18:14.561 --> 18:15.895
TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.497
HE HAS HIS REASONS.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.533
HE WENT TO GO VISIT HER TODAY
 TO ASK FOR A DIVORCE.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.269
AH, SO HE COULD
 MARRY YOU, I SUPPOSE.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.604
THE MAN IS EVEN A BIGGER FOOL
 THAN I THOUGHT.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.206
IF THAT'S TRUE,

18:26.239 --> 18:29.609
AND HE TELLS HER
 ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP...

18:29.642 --> 18:32.212
THAT MAKES HER A LIABILITY.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.480
WHY DO YOU THINK
 I'M TELLING YOU ALL THIS?

18:33.513 --> 18:34.414
WAIT, YOU THINK VICTORIA

18:34.447 --> 18:36.916
COULD'VE HAD YOUR MOTHER
DECLARED CRAY-CRAY

18:36.949 --> 18:40.187
AND LOCKED UP
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

18:41.721 --> 18:45.292
ONLY TWO PEOPLE
CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.560
I NEED TO GET CLOSE
WITH THE GRAYSONS AGAIN.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.695
WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT

18:48.728 --> 18:50.630
AFTER YOU BROKE
POOR SPANIEL'S HEART.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.499
HE'S NOT THE ONLY WAY IN.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.900
STAY OUT OF TROUBLE
WHILE I'M GONE.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.936
YOU MEAN I CAN STAY?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.606
DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.676
AHOY!

19:03.710 --> 19:05.445
CAPTAIN JACK.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.415
OR SHOULD I SAY JACK DADDY?

19:08.448 --> 19:10.683
NOT FOR ANOTHER FOUR WEEKS.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.320
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
NOLAN.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.954
(both chuckle)

19:14.987 --> 19:16.923
OKAY.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.658
BACK FOR ANOTHER SEASON?

19:18.691 --> 19:20.427
WE'LL SEE
WHAT THE SUMMER HOLDS.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.430
BUT I'M CURRENTLY SORT OF
HAMPTONS HOMELESS.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.697
(laughs)
YOU? WHAT HAPPENED?

19:24.731 --> 19:26.299
I'M SELLING THE HOUSE.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.667
YOU KNOW, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED WITH TYLER

19:27.700 --> 19:30.470
AND, WELL, OTHER STABBY,
STRANGLE-Y THINGS,

19:30.503 --> 19:32.472
I'M IN THE MARKET
TO UPSIZE.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.673
(scoffs)

19:33.706 --> 19:35.508
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO STAY ON THE BOAT.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.677
HELL, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO BUY IT AGAIN.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.679
UH...
EMILY'S COOL WITH ME

19:39.712 --> 19:41.681
STAYING WITH HER
TEMPORARILY, SO...

19:41.714 --> 19:44.217
SHE'S--SHE'S BACK?

19:44.251 --> 19:45.752
OH, YEAH.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.354
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.688
I'VE BEEN A LITTLE, UH,

19:48.721 --> 19:51.691
A LITTLE PREOCCUPIED
THESE PAST FEW WEEKS.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.626
(Amanda)
I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.596
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER,
HAVE WE, JACK?

19:56.629 --> 19:58.231
HEY, NOLAN.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.466
MANDY.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.434
TELL HER TO CALL US.
I'M DYING TO SEE HER.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.770
WELL, I'M SURE
THE FEELING'S MUTUAL.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.738
WELL...

20:05.772 --> 20:08.275
IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU...

20:08.308 --> 20:11.311
BOTH.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.982
(woman) HI. CAN I HELP YOU?

20:16.015 --> 20:17.650
(Emily) HI. I'M HERE TO SEE
CHARLOTTE GRAYSON.

20:17.684 --> 20:18.718
EMILY.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.019
CHARLOTTE.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.689
OH, MY GOD.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.991
YOU LOOK... GREAT.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.559
DR. THOMAS,
THIS IS EMILY THORNE.

20:26.593 --> 20:29.028
SHE'S THE ONE WHO'S BEEN
SENDING ME THOSE POSTCARDS

20:29.061 --> 20:30.730
FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.766
OH, THEY MEANT A LOT
TO CHARLOTTE, AS YOU CAN TELL.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.270
I'M--I'M SO SORRY...

20:37.304 --> 20:38.671
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

20:38.705 --> 20:39.806
I KNOW.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.542
IT'S STILL UNREAL.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.711
YOU'RE COMING TO THE MEMORIAL,
I HOPE.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.814
UNLESS IT'S TOO AWKWARD
WITH DANIEL AND ASHLEY.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.749
LISTEN, I HATE TO INTERRUPT,
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA KEEP

20:49.782 --> 20:51.050
TO YOUR RELEASE SCHEDULE,

20:51.083 --> 20:52.652
WE NEED TO GET MOVING
ON THE EXIT PROCESS,

20:52.685 --> 20:55.522
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY MEANS
ONE LAST BLOOD DRAW.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.689
(chuckles) GREAT.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.591
(chuckles) WELL, HERE.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.594
(laughs) WILL I BE SEEING YOU?
PLEASE SAY YES.

21:01.628 --> 21:02.862
YOU BET.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.833
(boat horn blows,
seagulls crying)

21:06.866 --> 21:10.036
(knoCOME IN.or)

21:10.069 --> 21:11.471
(man on TV) ...DURING
 THE DIS(woman groaning)BIRTH.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.773
(turns off TV)

21:13.806 --> 21:15.041
EMILY.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.543
AMANDA.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.411
(grunts) I KNEW
YOU WOULDN'T STAY AWAY.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.513
WELL, HOW COULD I

21:20.547 --> 21:22.515
WHEN WE HAVE SO MUCH
TO TALK ABOUT?

21:22.549 --> 21:24.751
I KNOW.
TAKEDA DEBRIEFED ME.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.854
WHATEVER YOU NEED,
I'M HERE TO HELP.

21:27.887 --> 21:31.758
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR ME.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.861
BUT I'M
ON A DIFFERENT PATH NOW.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.564
WOW.

21:37.597 --> 21:40.867
BACK FIVE SECONDS, AND ALREADY,
YOU'RE PUSHING ME AWAY.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.837
EXCEPT THIS TIME,
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.507
JACK AND I ARE
IN THIS TOGETHER, FOR REAL.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.343
HE THINKS YOU'RE ME, AMANDA.
HOW REAL CAN IT BE?

21:50.377 --> 21:52.879
PLENTY ONCE THE BABY COMES.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.348
AND DON'T FORGET...

21:55.382 --> 21:57.584
IF HE LEARNS THE TRUTH
ABOUT ME,

21:57.617 --> 21:59.852
EVERYONE LEARNS THE TRUTH
ABOUT YOU.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.354
(door opens)

22:01.388 --> 22:04.090
AMANDA, YOU, UH,
YOU HUNG--

22:04.123 --> 22:05.458
EMILY.

22:05.492 --> 22:06.759
HI, JACK.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.461
HI.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.629
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.897
YOU, TOO.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.536
(Jack) EVERYTHING OKAY?

22:16.569 --> 22:18.137
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:18.170 --> 22:19.639
AMANDA, S--

22:19.672 --> 22:21.574
SHOULD YOU TELL JACK
OR SHOULD I?

22:21.608 --> 22:24.511
GO FOR IT.

22:24.544 --> 22:27.614
AMANDA JUST ASKED ME TO BE
THE BABY'S GODMOTHER.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.949
(sighs)

22:38.425 --> 22:40.493
SHE'S GONE.

22:44.464 --> 22:48.134
HER JUDGMENT IS
FOREVER CLOUDED BY HER HEART.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.604
(speaks Japanese)

22:53.172 --> 22:56.776
YOU THINK YOU CAN SUCCEED
WHERE I HAVE NOT?

22:56.809 --> 23:00.547
I WON'T ALLOW HER TO MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.515
I'VE LIVED
WITH THOSE CONSEQUENCES

23:02.549 --> 23:05.184
FOR TOO LONG.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.853
IF YOU FAIL,

23:06.886 --> 23:09.689
THE MISSION IS OVER...

23:09.722 --> 23:11.824
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.944
(classical music playing)

23:31.978 --> 23:36.449
(indistinct conversations)

23:40.653 --> 23:41.988
(seagulls crying)

23:42.021 --> 23:44.457
(Ashley)
GORDON, DASHING AS ALWAYS.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.858
HI!IEN, YOU LOOK SPECTACULAR.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.727
(Vivien) WHO IS THAT?

23:47.760 --> 23:50.663
PLEASE CHECK THE SOUND SYSTEM.
I WON'T TOLERATE FEEDBACK.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.699
ASHLEY,
THIS IS QUITE AN AFFAIR

23:52.732 --> 23:55.201
YOUR MINIONS HAVE PUT TOGETHER
IN HONOR OF MY LATE WIFE.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.969
I COULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT BETTER MYSELF.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.237
WHERE IS MY SON?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.839
OH, HE'S OFF
BROODING SOMEWHERE

23:59.872 --> 24:03.676
OR DRINKING
OR MAYBE EVEN BOTH.

24:03.710 --> 24:07.647
(indistinct conversations)

24:17.056 --> 24:19.826
EMILY THORNE...

24:19.859 --> 24:21.494
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

24:21.528 --> 24:23.930
(exhales) YES.

24:29.569 --> 24:34.040
THE RETURN OF THE VIVACIOUS
AND ELUSIVE MS. EMILY THORNE.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.008
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
TO RECONCILE, YOU KNOW?

24:36.042 --> 24:38.745
(chuckles)
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, DAD.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.913
WHY NOT? COME ON.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.583
SHE'S A MUCH MORE SUITABLE MATCH
THAN THE DELIGHTFUL

24:43.616 --> 24:46.919
IF FROTHY LITTLE CONFECTION
ASHLEY DAVENPORT.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.855
YEAH, WELL,
AT LEAST ASHLEY'S SMART ENOUGH

24:48.888 --> 24:51.524
NOT TO CHEAT ON ME.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.092
IS SHE NOW?

24:55.562 --> 24:57.063
I TAKE IT YOU'VE GIVEN
SOME CONSIDERATION

24:57.096 --> 24:59.065
TO OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION?

25:00.733 --> 25:02.835
I DID.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.070
MY MONEY STAYS IN TRUST.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.705
IF THE COMPANY GOES DOWN,

25:05.738 --> 25:07.974
HELL IF I'M
GOING DOWN WITH IT.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.744
YOU DISAPPOINT ME.

25:11.778 --> 25:15.314
***

25:15.347 --> 25:16.649
(indistinct conversations)

25:16.683 --> 25:18.818
(Nolan) CREEPY.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.988
YOU THINK SHE'S SOMEWHERE
LOOKING UP AT US?

25:33.833 --> 25:36.836
(indistinct conversations)

25:36.869 --> 25:39.906
(laughter)

25:44.110 --> 25:46.112
NO, THANK YOU.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.847
EMILY.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.115
UH...

25:49.148 --> 25:51.684
WHAT A SURPRISE.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.986
CHARLOTTE INVITED ME.
I HOPE THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.955
OF COURSE.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.924
I'VE REALLY MISSED YOU.

25:57.957 --> 26:01.060
ME, TOO.

26:01.093 --> 26:04.597
THINGS HAVE CERTAINLY CHANGED
IN A YEAR, HAVEN'T THEY?

26:04.631 --> 26:08.334
YES, THEY HAVE.
EMILY, I AM S--

26:08.367 --> 26:11.604
HELLO, EMILY.
YOU LOOK WELL.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.106
YOU, TOO, DANIEL.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.144
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.079
I HOPE YOU GOT MY CARD.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.716
ASH, DID WE GET A CARD
FROM EMILY?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.852
YES. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.620
HEY, KIDS.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.355
MM. I HOPE A COSMO'S OKAY.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.657
THAMM-HMM.

26:30.690 --> 26:31.791
DON'T WORRY, DANIEL.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.693
I PROMISE NOT TO SPILL IT
ON YOUR JACKET THIS YEAR.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.628
(chuckles)

26:35.662 --> 26:37.396
LUNCH SOMETIME?

26:37.429 --> 26:39.098
OF COURSE.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.777
***

26:50.810 --> 26:52.078
(clatter)

26:52.111 --> 26:54.814
***

26:54.847 --> 26:57.750
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA DO THIS
BY YOURSELF?

26:57.784 --> 26:59.719
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A CHOICE.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.187
***

27:01.220 --> 27:04.156
IS THAT HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT ME, TOO?

27:04.190 --> 27:06.158
WHAT?

27:06.192 --> 27:09.428
AMANDA, DON'T--
DON'T SAY STUFF LIKE THAT.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.765
WE'RE BOTH THINKING IT,
AREN'T WE?

27:12.799 --> 27:14.166
I MEAN...

27:14.200 --> 27:15.434
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN

27:15.467 --> 27:18.204
SPENDING ALL THOSE NIGHTS
ON THE BOAT, RIGHT?

27:21.207 --> 27:25.011
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.880
THEN WHAT?

27:27.914 --> 27:30.683
JACK,
ONCE THE BABY COMES,

27:30.717 --> 27:32.418
HE'S GONNA NEED STABILITY.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.253
ME, TOO.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.926
YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.193
IF WE'RE GONNA BE A FAMILY,

27:41.227 --> 27:43.462
WE SHOULD START LIVING
LIKE A FAMILY.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.232
I'LL MOVE MY STUFF
BACK IN TONIGHT, OKAY?

27:46.265 --> 27:48.701
(exhales)

27:49.969 --> 27:51.804
WHAT ABOUT DECLAN?

27:51.838 --> 27:55.007
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT ME?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.112
(kisses)

28:02.148 --> 28:04.784
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
MOVING DOWN TO THE BOAT

28:04.817 --> 28:05.918
FOR A WHILE?

28:05.952 --> 28:07.253
OH, SURE. YEAH. WHATEVER.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.955
DEC.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.224
DEC.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.127
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

28:15.161 --> 28:16.729
TELL HER YOU'RE NOT
IN LOVE WITH HER.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.097
(sighs)

28:18.130 --> 28:19.732
I'M SORRY,

28:19.766 --> 28:21.267
BUT LIVING A LIE IS NOT GONNA
DO ANY GOOD FOR ANYBODY,

28:21.300 --> 28:22.468
LEAST OF ALL THAT KID.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.236
I'M JUST TRYING
TO DO RIGHT BY EVERYONE.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.172
START WITH YOURSELF.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.909
(sighs)

28:29.942 --> 28:31.277
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

28:31.310 --> 28:33.813
(exhales) FREE.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.514
EXCUSE ME.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.816
(classical music playing)

28:36.849 --> 28:40.252
DARLING,
YOU LOOK RADIANT.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.755
UH, YOU'RE STILL ON TRACK
FOR RELEASE THIS WEEK

28:42.789 --> 28:44.156
I TAKE IT.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.925
I'M JUST WAITING FOR HER
BLOOD PANEL TO COME BACK, YEAH.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.193
DON'T WORRY. I'M CLEAN.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.494
I KNOW.

28:48.527 --> 28:49.561
LISTEN, I WAS THINKING

28:49.595 --> 28:51.798
THAT WE MIGHT SPEND THE SUMMER
IN THE CITY THIS YEAR,

28:51.831 --> 28:53.199
AWAY FROM ALL THOSE, UH,

28:53.232 --> 28:55.034
TERRIBLE MEMORIES
AT THE BEACH HOUSE.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.836
I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING.

28:56.869 --> 28:57.970
(chuckles)

28:58.004 --> 28:59.839
I WANT TO SELL IT.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.874
IS THAT SO?

29:01.908 --> 29:04.176
WELL, I'M--I'M AFRAID

29:04.210 --> 29:05.778
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
AN UPHILL BATTLE

29:05.812 --> 29:08.948
CONVINCING YOUR BROTHER
TO, UH, PUT UP HIS HALF.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.784
HE CAN BUY ME OUT.
I'D BE FINE WITH THAT, TOO.

29:11.818 --> 29:14.053
I SEE.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.054
(Ashley, amplified voice)
GOOD AFTERNOON,

29:15.087 --> 29:19.258
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
AND HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.060
IT SEEMED ONLY FITTING

29:21.093 --> 29:23.930
TO USE THE OFFICIAL START
OF THE SEASON

29:23.963 --> 29:26.232
TO PAY TRIBUTE TO A WOMAN

29:26.265 --> 29:29.869
WHOSE ABSENCE
IS STILL UNIMAGINABLE.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.538
I'M REFERRING, OF COURSE,
TO THE LATE GREAT HUMANITARIAN

29:32.571 --> 29:35.541
AND PHILANTHROPIST
VICTORIA GRAYSON.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.043
SHE'S GIVING THE EULOGY?

29:37.076 --> 29:39.045
UH, TRIBUTE, SWEETHEART.
TRIBUTE.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.546
EULOGIES ARE FOR FUNERALS.

29:40.579 --> 29:43.182
...VICTORIA'S IMPECCABLE
ART COLLECTION.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.583
AND I'M CONFIDENT
THAT VICTORIA,

29:44.616 --> 29:47.219
WHOM I WORKED SO CLOSELY WITH
FOR SO LONG,

29:47.253 --> 29:50.990
WOULD SAY THAT, IN A WORD,
SHE APPROVES.

29:51.023 --> 29:54.160
(sighs) WHILE WHIRLING
LIKE A DERVISH IN HER GRAVE.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.895
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I GIVE YOU

29:55.928 --> 29:58.831
AN EXQUISITE WORK
BY DOMINIK WRIGHT--

29:58.865 --> 30:02.001
THE APTLY TITLED
"VICTORIA, UNFINISHED."

30:02.034 --> 30:05.104
(applause)

30:05.137 --> 30:07.874
MAY I SAY A FEW WORDS?

30:07.907 --> 30:09.141
OF COURSE.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.247
(amplified voice)
SORRY, I JUST...

30:15.281 --> 30:19.085
I CAN'T LET THIS DAY GO ON
WITHOUT SOMEONE POINTING OUT

30:19.118 --> 30:21.220
THAT VICTORIA GRAYSON

30:21.253 --> 30:25.291
WAS MORE THAN JUST ART AUCTIONS
AND FANCY PARTIES.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.893
YES, SHE WAS GENEROUS,

30:26.926 --> 30:30.129
BUT SHE WAS ALSO A WOMAN
OF MANY CONTRADICTIONS

30:30.162 --> 30:33.199
AND DEEP SECRETS.

30:33.232 --> 30:36.635
AS CONFUSING AS THAT
COULD BE SOMETIMES,

30:36.668 --> 30:40.306
TO ME, SHE WAS SIMPLY MOM.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.410
AND IT TOOK LOSING HER
FOR ME TO REALIZE

30:44.443 --> 30:47.313
THE TRUTH OF JUST HOW MUCH
SHE LOVED ME

30:47.346 --> 30:49.181
AND HOW MUCH I FELT THE SAME.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.020
I'VE MADE A LOT
OF POSITIVE CHANGE IN MY LIFE,

30:54.053 --> 30:56.155
AND I WANT MY FAMILY--

30:56.188 --> 30:58.157
DAD...

30:58.190 --> 30:59.291
DANIEL--

30:59.325 --> 31:00.426
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

31:00.459 --> 31:01.894
THAT I INTEND
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY...

31:01.928 --> 31:03.129
(IN HONOR OF MOM.)

31:03.162 --> 31:04.897
(applause)

31:04.931 --> 31:06.165
(ring)

31:06.198 --> 31:07.967
(Ashley)
THANK YOU SO MUCH, CHARLOTTE.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.235
HELLO?

31:09.268 --> 31:10.903

31:10.937 --> 31:12.404
AND NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

31:12.438 --> 31:13.906
PLEASE ENJOY
THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON

31:13.940 --> 31:16.008

31:16.042 --> 31:18.344
VERY INSPIRATIONAL,
SWEETHEART. (kisses)

31:18.377 --> 31:19.946
AND HEARTFELT.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.180
SWEET.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.448
GET REFILLS.

31:22.481 --> 31:25.651
BY ALL MEANS, ALLOW ME.

31:25.684 --> 31:28.354
CHARLOTTE, I'VE JUST RECEIVED
SOME UPSETTING NEWS.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.057
YOUR BLOOD WORK CAME BACK.
IT'S POSITIVE FOR HYDROCODONE.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.992
THATOH, CHARLOTTE.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.393
IT'S OKAY, CHARLOTTE.
WE CAN DO ANOTHER BLOOD TEST.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.295
BUT FIRST WE NEED TO
GET YOU BACK TO THE CENTER.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.429
OKAY?

31:37.463 --> 31:38.664
NO, THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.332
NO, SCHARLOTTE. CHARLOTTE.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.333
CHARLOTTE, CALM YOURSELF.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.335
YOU BLEW UP THAT PLANE

31:43.369 --> 31:45.071
AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING
(Conrad) FOR GOD SAKE!

31:45.104 --> 31:47.673
COME ON, COME ON.
NO! EMILY!.

31:47.706 --> 31:52.211
(whispering indistinctly)

31:55.481 --> 31:56.682
HEY.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.217
WHOA. HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.953
(guests murmuring)

32:00.987 --> 32:02.989
WHAT DID I MISS?

32:09.328 --> 32:11.397
WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.209
(Emily)
CHARLOTTE SENT ME.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.511
COME IN. QUICKLY.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.283
WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER?

32:31.317 --> 32:33.152
(sighs)
SHE'S BACK IN REHAB.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.453
SHE TOLD ME
WHERE TO FIND YOU.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.188
DOES ANYONE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE?

32:36.222 --> 32:37.323
NO.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.225
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:39.258 --> 32:42.061
THEY FOUND DRUGS
IN HER SYSTEM.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.396
CHARLOTTE SWORE
SHE WASN'T USING.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.398
AND SHE MIGHT
BE TELLING THE TRUTH.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.267
CHARLOTTE BELIEVES
THERE'S A CONSPIRACY

32:48.300 --> 32:49.501
TO KEEP HER LOCKED UP.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.508
(auto dials)

32:56.542 --> 33:00.479
(phone rings)

33:00.512 --> 33:01.447
(cell phone buzzes)

33:01.480 --> 33:03.349
SHH!

33:03.382 --> 33:06.352
(buzz)

33:06.385 --> 33:09.288

33:09.321 --> 33:12.291

33:12.324 --> 33:14.293
(buzz)

33:14.326 --> 33:15.494
(buzz, beep)

33:15.527 --> 33:17.463
WHO IS THIS?

33:19.198 --> 33:20.266
(cell phone clatters)

33:20.299 --> 33:23.502
(huffs) CONRAD MUST HAVE
HER COUNSELOR ON HIS PAYROLL.

33:23.535 --> 33:24.436
THAT SON OF A BITCH

33:24.470 --> 33:26.372
IS TRYING TO GET CONTROL
OF HER INHERITANCE.

33:26.405 --> 33:29.175
VICTORIA, FORGIVE ME
IF I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED,

33:29.208 --> 33:31.543
BUT... CHARLOTTE'S
ONLY INHERITING

33:31.577 --> 33:33.479
BECAUSE EVERYBODY THINKS
THAT YOU ARE DEAD.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.514
THAT'S THE WAY
IT HAS TO STAY.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.783
SUFFICE IT TO SAY
THAT CONRAD

33:37.816 --> 33:39.385
BROUGHT THAT PLANE DOWN.

33:39.418 --> 33:42.154
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL ME
AND DESTROY FEDERAL EVIDENCE.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.555
THE GOVERNMENT
IS KEEPING ME SAFE

33:43.589 --> 33:45.457
WHILE THEY BUILD
THEIR CASE AGAINST HIM.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.193
INCREDIBLE.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.460
AND CHARLOTTE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNEW THE TRUTH.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.362
I INSISTED ON IT.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.598
BUT NOW IT APPEARS
SHE'S NO LONGER SAFE EITHER.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.369
I FOUND YOUR BURNER PHONE,
CHARLOTTE.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.405
IS THIS HOW YOU'VE BEEN
CONTACTING YOUR DRUG DEALER?

33:59.438 --> 34:01.407
NO, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.275
YOU'VE RECEIVED
A DOZEN PHONE CALLS

34:03.309 --> 34:05.277
OVER THE LAST EIGHT WEEKS
FROM A BLOCKED NUMBER.

34:05.311 --> 34:06.412
WHAT ELSE SHOULD I THINK?

34:06.445 --> 34:07.546
DO ANOTHER BLOOD TEST
IF YOU WANT.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.547
I HAVEN'T BEEN USING.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.318
PLEASE.
I NEED THAT PHONE BACK.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.554
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.257
(sighs)

34:18.290 --> 34:19.525
(cell phone rings)

34:19.558 --> 34:21.493
(ring)

34:21.527 --> 34:22.494
(beep)

34:22.527 --> 34:23.629
HOW'S MY DAUGHTER?

34:23.661 --> 34:25.231
(Thomas) Resting.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.498
GOOD.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.367
I found a burner phone
in her room.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.101
IT MAY NOT BE A SECRET LINE
TO HER DRUG DEALER,

34:30.136 --> 34:32.170
BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY
MAKE IT SEEM THAT WAY.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.106
IN ANY CASE, IT'LL HELP
BOLSTER THE RESULTS

34:34.139 --> 34:35.607
OF THE FALSE POSITIVE
ON HER DRUG TEST.

34:35.641 --> 34:36.708
Fine, fine, fine.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.510
MY ATTORNEY WILL BE IN TOUCH
WITH YOU IN THE MORNING

34:38.543 --> 34:40.612
TO TAKE YOUR DEPOSITION
ABOUT HER MENTAL STATE.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.414
AND THE PAYMENT?

34:44.183 --> 34:46.118
AFTER A JUDGE GRANTS ME
POWER OF ATTORNEY

34:46.152 --> 34:47.518
OVER HER INHERITANCE.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.255
GOOD NIGHT.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.356
(beep, cell phone clatters)

34:50.389 --> 34:53.425
(whirring)

34:55.427 --> 34:57.229
(Nolan)
HEY, WHERE WERE YOU?

34:57.263 --> 34:59.265
VICTORIA'S ALIVE.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.499
COME AGAIN?

35:00.532 --> 35:02.468
THAT'S WHAT CHARLOTTE
WHISPERED INTO MY EAR

35:02.501 --> 35:04.236
ON THE BOAT
BEFORE THHOLY MOLY. HER OFF.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.605
APPARENTLY, THE GOVERNMENT
IS KEEPING VICTORIA HIDDEN

35:06.638 --> 35:08.640
UNTIL THEY CAN BUILD
A CASE AGAINST CONRAD,

35:08.674 --> 35:10.242
OR SO SHE SAYS.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.443
YOU TALKED TO HER?

35:11.477 --> 35:12.544
(sighs)

35:12.578 --> 35:15.881
THEN Y(exhales) YEAH.HE IS?

35:15.914 --> 35:18.284
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

35:18.317 --> 35:21.420
PLAY A HUNCH. I NEED
TO GET A CAMERA IN THERE.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.224
ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD USE THIS.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.493
UM, YEAH. CLAM CAM.
I LIKE IT.

35:27.526 --> 35:28.894
ONE MORE THING.
HOW FAST CAN YOU RUN

35:28.927 --> 35:30.596
A DEEP BACKGROUND
ON CHARLOTTE'S DOCTOR?

35:30.629 --> 35:32.231
(knock on door)

35:32.264 --> 35:34.266
UH, JACK'S HERE.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.635
UH...

35:36.668 --> 35:38.570
YOU GO.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.272
SUDDENLY, I GOT WORK TO DO.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.215
HELLO, JACK.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.349
HI.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.550
(closes door)

35:51.583 --> 35:53.619
I'M SORRY
IF I'M INTERRUPTING.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.254
NO, NOT AT ALL.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.556
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

35:57.589 --> 36:00.426
YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S JUST, WE, UH...

36:00.459 --> 36:03.262
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO TALK SINCE...

36:05.964 --> 36:09.368
YOU KNOW, SINCE THE NIGHT
SAMMY DIED.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.640
IT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER AGO.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.475
YEAH.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.743
YEAH, FOR ME, TOO.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.247
EMILY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

36:21.280 --> 36:22.648
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
I HAD NO IDEA

36:22.681 --> 36:23.749
THAT AMANDA WAS COMING BACK

36:23.782 --> 36:25.717
LET ALONE
THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.488
I WOULD NEVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO YOU.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.257
I KNOW THAT.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.792
IF I COULD
GO BACK IN TIME...

36:35.694 --> 36:37.663
BUT YOU CAN'T.

36:39.631 --> 36:42.701
WE CAN'T.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.670
NO.

36:47.673 --> 36:51.510
WE'RE GONNA NAME HIM
AFTER OUR DADS.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.711
CARL DAVID PORTER.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.647
(chuckles)

36:55.681 --> 36:58.684
I'M SURE THEY'D BOTH
BE HONORED.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.489
JACK, I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON

37:03.522 --> 37:06.658
FOR SAYING THIS, BUT...

37:06.692 --> 37:11.363
AMANDA'S LED
A PRETTY TROUBLED LIFE.

37:11.397 --> 37:14.633
I JUST WOULDN'T WANT
TO SEE YOU GET HURT AGAIN.

37:17.369 --> 37:20.339
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE
THE BABY'S YOURS?

37:36.455 --> 37:38.524
(Victoria) EMILY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE?

37:38.557 --> 37:40.559
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
YOU'D ONLY RETURN

37:40.592 --> 37:42.294
IF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.796
I DID SOME RESEARCH
ON DR. THOMAS.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.832
I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO SEE
WHAT I FOUND OUT.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.735
SEEMS AS THOUGH
YOUR SUSPICIONS ARE CORRECT.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.370
(rustles papers)

37:51.403 --> 37:52.871
THEY ALMOST ALWAYS ARE.

37:55.607 --> 37:56.708
(beeps)

37:56.742 --> 37:57.843
HE WAS SUED SIX TIMES

37:57.876 --> 37:59.445
FOR PROLONGING THE STAY
OF HIS PATIENTS

37:59.478 --> 38:01.447
IN ORDER
TO INCREASE HIS BILLINGS.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.449
IN EXCHANGE FOR
A GENEROUS DONATION.

38:03.482 --> 38:04.583
EXACTLY.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.684
HE OPERATED UNDER
THREE DIFFERENT NAMES

38:05.717 --> 38:07.686
IN THREE DIFFERENT STATES,
POSSIBLY MORE.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.321
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT TO KNOW

38:09.355 --> 38:10.522
EXACTLY WHO
YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.724
ALWAYS.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.726
WELL, I'M SURE
THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT FRIENDS

38:14.760 --> 38:16.462
WILL HAVE HIM ARRESTED,

38:16.495 --> 38:18.830
AND... CHARLOTTE
WILL BE FREE IN NO TIME.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.468
EMILY.

38:22.501 --> 38:23.735
MM.

38:23.769 --> 38:27.339
I'M NOT SURE I DESERVE
THIS KINDNESS FROM YOU.

38:27.373 --> 38:30.576
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
YOU'RE ALIVE.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.543
GOOD-BYE, VICTORIA.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.879
(door opens)

38:35.747 --> 38:37.349
(door closes)

38:39.485 --> 38:41.920
(Jack)
AMANDA, WE NEED TO TALK.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.592
THERE'S SOMETHING NAGGING ME,

38:46.625 --> 38:48.126
AND I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER
FEEL QUITE RIGHT ABOUT US

38:48.159 --> 38:49.495
UNTIL I KNOW.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.631
WHEN YOU LEFT...

38:52.664 --> 38:56.101
THE FIRST TIME, LAST SUMMER,
WHERE'D YOU GO?

38:56.134 --> 39:00.105
WHEN YOU GOT BEAT UP?

39:00.138 --> 39:02.441
JUST AWAY.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.576
WHO'D YOU STAY WITH?

39:04.610 --> 39:06.878
(sighs)

39:06.912 --> 39:08.780
OH, MY GOD.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.485
YOU DON'T THINK
THIS BABY IS YOURS.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.555
I NEED TO KNOW FOR SURE.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.592
THEN I'LL MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.533
DR. THOMAS CALLED.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.635
CHARLOTTE'S SETTLING
BACK IN TO CLIFFSIDE.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.571
AT LEAST SOMEONE'S
TAKING CARE OF HER.

39:32.604 --> 39:33.805
I'VE BEEN
A TERRIBLE BROTHER.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.841
I CAN'T BLAME HER
FOR NOT TRUSTING ME.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.876
CHARLOTTE'S SICK,
DANIEL.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.945
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S SAYING.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.680
THE THINGS SHE ACCUSED
YOUR FATHER OF

39:41.713 --> 39:44.616
ARE PREPOSTEROUS.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.818
YEAH.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.620
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.422
COME TO BED.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.759
YOU GO.
I'M GONNA STAY HERE A WHILE.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.661
(woman) * OUT OF THE BLUE

39:55.694 --> 39:59.465
* AND INTO THE BLACK

40:01.633 --> 40:02.834
AAH!

40:02.868 --> 40:04.603
* THEY GIVE YOU THIS

40:04.636 --> 40:08.774
* BUT YOU PAY FOR THAT

40:11.009 --> 40:13.612
* AND ONCE YOU'RE GONE

40:13.645 --> 40:15.747
* YOU CAN NEVER

40:15.781 --> 40:18.550
* COME BACK

40:18.584 --> 40:19.685
(phone ringing)

40:19.718 --> 40:22.588
* WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF THE BLUE

40:22.621 --> 40:23.589
* AND I(click) BLACK

40:23.622 --> 40:27.025
You've reached Charlotte.
 Leave a message.

40:29.561 --> 40:30.996
* HEY HEY

40:31.029 --> 40:34.633
* MY MY

40:37.836 --> 40:39.605
* ROCK 'N' ROLL

40:39.638 --> 40:43.475
* CAN NEVER DIE

40:45.911 --> 40:50.482
* THERE'S MORE TO THE PICTURE

40:50.516 --> 40:54.520
* THAN MEETS THE EYE

40:55.687 --> 40:58.624
* HEY HEY

40:58.657 --> 41:00.626
* MY MY

41:00.659 --> 41:01.927
SOME SAY THAT TO BELIEVE
 IN DESTINY

41:01.960 --> 41:05.664
IS TO DISMISS
 THE ROLE OF FREE WILL...

41:05.697 --> 41:07.766
THAT SELF-DETERMINATION
 CANNOT PREVAIL

41:07.799 --> 41:09.701
IN THE PRESENCE OF FATE...

41:12.303 --> 41:13.972
YOU BETTER BE HOUSE HUNTING.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.641
(chuckles)

41:15.674 --> 41:17.909
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.650
(sighs)

41:24.683 --> 41:25.651
ANYTHING?

41:25.684 --> 41:27.586
NOT YET.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.655
(Victoria)
 WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

41:29.688 --> 41:31.657
I'VE LEFT FIVE MESSAGES
 FOR YOU.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.291
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.561
(clicks keys)

41:35.594 --> 41:37.629
(White-haired Man)
 I DON'T WORK FOR YOU, VICTORIA.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.064
(Nolan) MY GOD.
THEY'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.666
THIS IS MEANT TO BE

41:40.699 --> 41:42.701
A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL
 ARRANGEMENT.

41:42.734 --> 41:45.871
WELL, THAT ARRANGEMENT
 MIGHT BE IN JEOPARDY.

41:45.904 --> 41:49.808
CHARLOTTE TOLD EMILY THORNE
 A VERSION OF THE TRUTH.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.677
SHE COULD BE OUR DOWNFALL.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.812
I TAKE IT
 YOU DON'T TRUST HER.

41:53.845 --> 41:54.846
NO.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.082
I NEVER HAVE.

41:57.115 --> 41:58.684
(Emily) WHEN THE TRUTH IS,

41:58.717 --> 42:00.819
THE ONLY PART OF DESTINY
 WE CAN CONTROL

42:00.852 --> 42:03.922
IS THE FATE WE CHOOSE
 FOR ANOTHER.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.991
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME
 TO DO ABOUT HER?

42:06.024 --> 42:09.728
WHAT YOU'VE DONE
 SO MANY TIMES BEFORE.

42:09.761 --> 42:11.797
ELIMINATE THE LIABILITY.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.699
AS YOU WISH.

42:13.732 --> 42:17.035
WHAT THEY DID TO MY FATHER...

42:17.068 --> 42:19.771
THEY DID TO MY MOTHER, TOO.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.108
AND NOW
THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU.

42:23.141 --> 42:26.344
GOOD.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.979
LET THEM.
