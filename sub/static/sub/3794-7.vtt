01:36.297 --> 01:38.508
- I heard something.
- What?

01:39.482 --> 01:41.582
I think someone's in the house.

01:43.635 --> 01:44.635
Really?

01:47.267 --> 01:48.091
See?

01:48.474 --> 01:50.493
All right, I'll go check it out.

01:52.456 --> 01:53.821
Ahnold, want to come with?

01:56.232 --> 01:57.332
Thanks, pal.

02:00.890 --> 02:01.890
Hello?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.327
Turtle, is that you?

02:17.255 --> 02:19.520
Don't worry.
It's just the wind.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.384
Call 911.

02:37.195 --> 02:38.799
Ahnold would have heard something.

02:38.924 --> 02:41.771
I'm telling you, he didn't flinch.
Someone was definitely here.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.625
If he didn't bark, they weren't.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.456
- Maybe the girl set it up.
- Set what up?

02:46.799 --> 02:48.744
Fantasy rape scene perhaps.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.586
Is that what your girls do, Drama?

02:50.754 --> 02:53.590
- Tie you up and strap one on?
- Don't be juvenile, E.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.615
- Oh, christ.
- What is it?

02:56.585 --> 02:58.117
My half an agent.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.720
Johnny Drama, what did you do?

03:00.845 --> 03:03.766
- <i>It's not what I did.</i>
- You attacked a high-level studio exec.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.076
- Is that what they're saying?
- <i>They're not</i>

03:06.201 --> 03:08.196
<i>except that you won't
be needed on set today.</i>

03:08.321 --> 03:09.396
What? Why?

03:09.564 --> 03:11.398
Because you attacked an exec.

03:12.242 --> 03:14.401
- So now what? Am I done?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

03:14.569 --> 03:16.195
I'll let you know when I hear more.

03:16.749 --> 03:17.949
Thanks, Lloyd.

03:21.071 --> 03:22.889
They canceled my scenes today.

03:23.621 --> 03:25.769
He said he was gonna have me written
off the show.

03:25.894 --> 03:29.317
- You're gonna have to apologize.
- He hits on my best friend's girlfriend

03:29.442 --> 03:31.864
- and I'm supposed to apologize?
- You did grab him by the throat.

03:31.989 --> 03:34.672
He said he was gonna pound
Meadow Soprano from behind.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.966
You should've broken
his fucking arm.

03:38.104 --> 03:39.051
Sorry.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.779
Drama, I appreciate 'cause I know
you had the best intentions.

03:42.904 --> 03:43.889
Jamie does too.

03:44.583 --> 03:47.201
- But this is your job.
- Yeah, Johnny, you live for this show.

03:47.326 --> 03:49.144
Just suck it up and go talk to him.

03:53.261 --> 03:55.542
Should I bring a fruit
basket or something?

03:55.667 --> 03:57.570
Maybe a massage certificate
from Burke Williams?

04:00.051 --> 04:01.683
I'll just leave it up to me then.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.075
I'm out.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.710
- Good luck.
- See you, Drama.

04:06.068 --> 04:08.576
Hey, Vince, we found
no sign of forced entry.

04:08.701 --> 04:10.624
And you can't find
anything missing, right?

04:11.034 --> 04:13.383
No, but the living room
door was open.

04:13.655 --> 04:16.038
- You could have left it open?
- I don't think so.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.951
Well, if someone was here, the good news
is you're okay and nothing's been taken.

04:20.076 --> 04:23.012
If they come back, call us
and we'll come back.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.001
Thanks, officers.
I appreciate it.

04:25.126 --> 04:26.849
- Thanks for coming down.
- Sorry, Vince.

04:27.168 --> 04:28.657
Somebody was here.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.335
Now that everyone's safe and sound
I'm gonna head off to work.

04:31.460 --> 04:32.928
- Want us to roll with?
- No.

04:33.053 --> 04:35.065
- Why not?
- I want to make a good impression.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.151
What do you think people think
when they see us?

04:37.319 --> 04:40.613
- Call me if you want to have lunch.
- All right, hotshot. Enjoy.

04:41.843 --> 04:45.117
Mr. Vince.
Do you no have underwear for cleaning?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.495
- Yeah, whatever's there, Maria. Thanks.
- No, it's not there.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.445
Is socks and shirts,
but no underwear.

04:51.570 --> 04:53.846
I just dropped my dirty stuff
down there last night.

04:53.971 --> 04:55.502
- Tons of underwear.
- Me too.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.963
It's not there.

04:57.991 --> 04:59.423
I told you someone was here.

04:59.617 --> 05:02.009
You think someone broke in
and stole our underwear?

05:04.679 --> 05:05.638
Jesus.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.907
Before we jump in
today we need to welcome

05:10.032 --> 05:12.499
our newest family member,
Mr. Eric Murphy.

05:12.624 --> 05:14.100
Catch him up, show him around.

05:14.225 --> 05:17.623
I want him feeling like he's been here
all his life by the end of the day.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.365
- Got you a cup of coffee, Mr. Murphy.
- Thank you very much.

05:25.053 --> 05:27.368
And these just came
from the front desk for you.

05:27.850 --> 05:29.453
I didn't order any pizza.

05:29.857 --> 05:32.392
Ari Gold sent them.
The delivery guy said to tell you

05:32.517 --> 05:36.210
good luck and you're no longer
a pizza boy, you're now a pizza man.

05:37.131 --> 05:39.254
- Cool.
- Okay, let's get to it.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.466
This is a signing meeting.
So tell me who have we signed?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.798
I have Penelope Cruz,
like, right there.

05:44.923 --> 05:46.965
Right the is not there.
What else?

05:47.090 --> 05:49.842
- I signed Neil Elman.
- Tell me about it.

05:49.967 --> 05:52.061
Hot young writer-director
out of Sundance.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.894
Has two specs ready to go.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.350
When they sell we'll clap for you.
On the comedy front,

05:57.475 --> 05:59.352
Chris Rock is doing a new tour,

05:59.477 --> 06:02.111
so you can applaud me
for saving your asses.

06:02.699 --> 06:03.699
Silently.

06:04.363 --> 06:08.367
But why is Bob Saget
making 50 grand a night

06:08.577 --> 06:10.160
and we're making dick?

06:10.328 --> 06:12.360
I've called him 20 times.
He won't return my calls.

06:12.485 --> 06:14.081
You've called him, Scott?

06:14.258 --> 06:18.108
Everyone, let's give Scott Lavin here
a big morning clap

06:18.233 --> 06:19.872
'cause he called Bob Saget.

06:19.997 --> 06:22.172
Hi, Bob Saget, this is Scott.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.076
Please call me back.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.245
- I don't think he wants a manager.
- Nobody wants a manager.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.596
- Convince him that he needs one.
- I would love to,

06:29.764 --> 06:33.183
- but he won't return my calls.
- Well, stake-out his fucking house.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.686
I used to live next door to Bob.
I know him. I can call him.

06:36.392 --> 06:39.440
So let it be said, let it be done.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.127
Take care.
It's nice to meet you too.

06:45.252 --> 06:46.447
You need anything?

06:46.615 --> 06:49.652
- I need to send Ari Gold something.
- No problem. What is it?

06:49.777 --> 06:51.903
Maybe there's a guy
in the mailroom that could help me.

06:52.028 --> 06:53.865
Don't worry.
I'm like one of the guys.

06:53.990 --> 06:56.934
I've only been working for you for two
hours and the pizza thing pissed me off.

06:57.059 --> 06:58.727
- Let me know what I can do.
- OK.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.552
- Murphy group.
- What?

07:00.904 --> 07:02.054
Murphy group.

07:02.837 --> 07:04.715
Sexy, can I talk to your man
alone for a beat?

07:04.883 --> 07:07.113
Sure, douchebag.
Told you I was one of the guys.

07:07.238 --> 07:09.232
- I'll be in your office.
- Okay.

07:09.848 --> 07:10.848
What's up?

07:11.151 --> 07:14.058
So is this the whole group?

07:14.701 --> 07:16.310
- What do you mean?
- Murray said

07:16.478 --> 07:18.896
we were absorbing the Murphy group.
I was expecting a trifecta.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.648
- Well, it's just me.
- It's a weird fucking name, isn't it?

07:21.816 --> 07:23.484
What's up?
You seem a little tweaked.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.691
Yeah, well, I've been working
two things the last month.

07:27.250 --> 07:30.329
Bob Saget when the sun's up
and the Olsen twins when the sun's down.

07:30.454 --> 07:33.368
So I do not need you waltzing in
here and jumping on what's mine.

07:33.536 --> 07:37.032
- I was just trying to help, all right?
- Yeah, but you didn't help, you see?

07:37.398 --> 07:40.290
Murray said that this whole place
is kind of like a team thing.

07:40.415 --> 07:42.961
Yeah, it is.
And like any team

07:43.130 --> 07:45.204
you got Lebron James
who make $120 million.

07:45.329 --> 07:47.299
Then you got a jerkoff
who's on a 10-day contract.

07:47.468 --> 07:51.095
Whichever one of those you're gonna be,
neither steals the ball from the other.

07:51.288 --> 07:54.445
- Why don't we just call Bob together?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.870
I want to sign Bob alone and I will.

07:57.671 --> 07:59.144
Got a trash can?
Thanks.

08:07.494 --> 08:09.026
Yo, Lawrence.
What's up, kid?

08:09.151 --> 08:11.734
- Drama, how you doing?
- How do I look?

08:12.032 --> 08:13.408
You look okay, I guess.

08:13.644 --> 08:16.578
- Want to roll up this gate?
- Afraid I can't do that.

08:17.076 --> 08:19.181
- Why not?
- You're on the list.

08:19.653 --> 08:22.321
- What list?
- The banned-from-the-lot list.

08:22.786 --> 08:24.711
That's why your picture
is right there.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.549
Well, my picture
is also right there.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.636
- How do you explain that?
- Can't.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.804
But the message came
from Dan Coakley himself,

08:32.929 --> 08:35.347
so I'm assuming whatever
you did was real bad.

08:37.932 --> 08:40.018
Will you please get
Dan Coakley on the phone?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.186
Sure.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.059
Stop calling the office, John.

08:44.184 --> 08:46.818
Stop lurking outside
and stop trying to push me.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.737
<i>Please just let me
in so we can talk.</i>

08:48.862 --> 08:50.873
- What's to talk about?
- I'd like to apologize.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.135
- <i>I'm not interested in an apology.</i>
- Come on.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.033
We had words. Men do that.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.785
You put your hands around my throat.

08:56.987 --> 08:58.620
Men sometimes do that also.

08:58.996 --> 09:02.261
- <i>You said some pretty awful things.</i>
- So you're not really apologizing,

09:02.386 --> 09:04.568
you're just making
excuses for attacking me.

09:04.693 --> 09:06.399
- No, I...
- So if I was to tell you

09:06.524 --> 09:08.172
that Meadow Soprano blew me

09:08.340 --> 09:11.917
<i>last night, you might just go
and attack me again. The fact is</i>

09:12.093 --> 09:15.095
- she's here now sucking on my dick.
- <i>All right, that's enough.</i>

09:15.263 --> 09:17.431
- All right? I'm trying here.
- <i>Try harder,</i>

09:17.599 --> 09:21.252
'cause she is about
to swallow my balls
while I dive into her pussy.

09:21.377 --> 09:23.687
<i>That's it, you're a dead man, Coakley.
Do you hear me?</i>

09:23.855 --> 09:26.648
You're a fucking dead man!
I'm gonna rip your fucking scalp off!

09:33.367 --> 09:35.400
Did Mr. Coakley say you can go on?

09:36.186 --> 09:38.205
Vince, as proud as I am

09:38.330 --> 09:41.256
that you've reached stalker status,
you can't play around.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.582
- These are sick individuals.
- We have an alarm.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.385
- I'll learn to turn it on.
- You need to call my security guy.

09:46.510 --> 09:47.845
This guy is the best.

09:47.970 --> 09:49.630
I had a problem neighbor.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.740
Couldn't trust him for shit.
When this guy was done arming my house,

09:52.865 --> 09:54.801
it was as secure as Air Force One.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.054
I didn't realize
you were such a pussy, Ari.

09:57.222 --> 10:00.150
I didn't realize your attack dog
was as worthless as you, Turtle.

10:00.275 --> 10:01.099
He's not.

10:01.830 --> 10:03.462
I think he's going deaf.

10:03.587 --> 10:04.665
Watch, Vin.

10:07.317 --> 10:08.148
See?

10:10.621 --> 10:12.984
- He's not deaf, he's stoned.
- Are we done here?

10:13.109 --> 10:16.065
We are not done, all right?
You need to take this really seriously.

10:16.208 --> 10:18.033
Somebody broke in here,

10:18.260 --> 10:20.319
went to your laundry room,
stole your underwear.

10:20.444 --> 10:23.497
I need to paint a picture of what goes
through the mind of someone like that?

10:23.665 --> 10:26.282
- No, please, don't.
- Call my guy.

10:26.407 --> 10:28.669
- Forget that. Let's go get a gun.
- Don't get a gun.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.702
- Why not?
- Because itwon't be a great story

10:30.827 --> 10:33.970
- if Turtle shoots you in the face.
- I'm a good shot, Ari.

10:34.095 --> 10:34.957
Are you?

10:35.082 --> 10:37.120
I think I would be.
I'm a good free-throw shooter.

10:37.245 --> 10:40.243
Vince, I thought you were maturing.
All this work and you're not listening.

10:40.368 --> 10:42.365
You're gonna lethim
be the 1st line of defense

10:42.490 --> 10:44.637
against some boxer
stealing serial killer?

10:44.762 --> 10:46.019
She could be a hot fan.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.840
More likely he's a creepy
little pale obsessive freak.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.110
- God.
- Speaking of which, where's E?

10:51.235 --> 10:52.317
He got an alibi?

10:57.893 --> 11:01.724
- A Sloan McQuewick calling for you.
- Tell her I'm in a meeting.

11:01.849 --> 11:03.829
Tell her I'll call you back.
I'll call her back.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.296
- I'll take it.
- What?

11:05.421 --> 11:06.571
Yeah, just...

11:07.217 --> 11:08.208
put her through.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.854
Guess I should learn how to pronounce
this one's name, huh?

11:10.979 --> 11:13.213
- Got a minute, babe?
- He's got an important call.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.757
Actually, this is equally important.
Doubly important.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.593
- That's OK. I'll call back.
- Just take a message.

11:19.318 --> 11:22.975
- Hey, what's up?
- I got Bob Saget to agree to come in.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.513
- That's great.
- Yeah.

11:24.638 --> 11:26.698
- How'd you do that?
- Dropped your name.

11:26.823 --> 11:29.514
- Cool. I'm glad I could help.
- He wants you in the meeting.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.304
We're gonna do it in my office.

11:33.541 --> 11:36.361
Look, Eric, I don't know
what you guys have together.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.992
You're friends, you're neighbors,

11:38.117 --> 11:40.713
you used his prick as a whistle...
whatever it is, he's mine.

11:40.838 --> 11:43.076
- Okay, we clear? He's mine.
- Yeah.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.594
All right.
Good.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.001
- Calm down, Johnny.
- <i>Don't tell me to calm down.</i>

11:51.403 --> 11:53.183
I try to apologize to this guy

11:53.308 --> 11:55.255
when he should be apologizing to me.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.592
- You attacked him.
- <i>You know what he said?</i>

11:57.717 --> 12:00.427
I know he's saying he said
nothing and that you're crazy.

12:00.604 --> 12:02.763
Everyone knows how he is.
I want to take this to the top.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.639
<i>All you have is your word
against his.</i>

12:04.807 --> 12:07.451
Then I'll find someone
who can back up my words.

12:11.260 --> 12:12.272
What is that?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.441
It's for Ari from Eric Murphy.

12:14.870 --> 12:15.870
"Suck it."

12:17.404 --> 12:19.185
That is not what this is for.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.952
I think there's someone in the tree.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.619
Stop.
You're stoned.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.537
May be, but I'm not kidding.
Come look.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.281
- Where?
- There.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.298
- It's a bird.
- No, there.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.712
- That is a squirrel.
- That's not where I'm looking.

12:38.837 --> 12:42.193
I'm looking through the tree past
that shrub right behind the car.

12:42.318 --> 12:44.256
I should never have
let Jamie take Ahnold.

12:44.381 --> 12:45.467
You're crazy.

12:45.782 --> 12:48.374
- I don't feel safe.
- There is nothing there.

12:48.918 --> 12:50.763
- We should go out there.
- No, stop it.

12:50.888 --> 12:53.522
I'm not gonna let you
or Ari make me paranoid.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.040
Jesus!

12:57.318 --> 12:58.602
It's just Temo.

13:01.996 --> 13:04.058
Okay, now I am a bit freaked.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.997
Bob, what you do not know about me

13:11.165 --> 13:12.833
is that I am 24/7.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.461
That is my middle fucking name.
Scotty 24/7 Lavin.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.199
What that means
is that every time you turn around

13:19.324 --> 13:22.863
anywhere, anytime,
you will be looking at this.

13:22.988 --> 13:25.458
That's just great.
That's just what I want to be looking at

13:25.583 --> 13:27.806
while I'm sniffing a line
off her ass... Your fucking face.

13:28.001 --> 13:30.693
That really completes the image.
You believe that, Scotty?

13:30.983 --> 13:32.967
If you do, you'd believe the check is in the mail.

13:33.092 --> 13:34.525
Understand and you're reluctant.

13:34.650 --> 13:38.191
But I want you to know that I swear
to God on my mother, I'll kill for you.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.432
- You will?
- Yes.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.408
- What if I kill?
- What do you mean?

13:41.533 --> 13:43.527
I mean, what if I kill
somebody late at night

13:43.652 --> 13:46.596
and I call you up and I go,
"Hey, 24/7, I'm fucked.

13:46.721 --> 13:49.035
"I just killed a guy at some
crack den in the hood."

13:49.230 --> 13:51.824
Will you come down there
in your silver 750 and pick me up

13:51.949 --> 13:54.683
and help me chop up the body
and dispose of it and then take me home

13:54.808 --> 13:57.379
and bathe me and then tuck me in?
Would you do all that for me?

13:57.504 --> 13:58.879
Because I would do that for me

13:59.263 --> 14:01.214
to keep 10 % of the money
that I make.

14:02.106 --> 14:04.009
We're done now.
I'm gonna talk to E.

14:05.314 --> 14:07.596
- So what's up, E?
- How are you, Bob?

14:07.764 --> 14:10.292
I'm almost as good as she looks
but not nearly as good as she tastes.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.392
You're so sweet, Bob.

14:12.972 --> 14:15.378
- So who's Vince fucking?
- No one specific.

14:15.503 --> 14:18.440
- Come on, don't hold out on me.
- You know, he just... He's having fun.

14:18.609 --> 14:21.026
- Did he do Milano in the tail?
- What? No.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.819
I saw her coming out of the house.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.391
- She was with Drama.
- I used to live next door tothem.

14:25.516 --> 14:28.584
The puss that rolled in and out
made my house look like a monastery.

14:30.058 --> 14:31.021
That's great.

14:31.146 --> 14:33.832
- Can we get back to this?
- Actually, no, Scotty, we can't.

14:33.957 --> 14:37.157
Not with you here. Because
you make me un-fucking-comfortable.

14:37.282 --> 14:39.044
I'm gonna talk to E now.
Would you leave?

14:39.806 --> 14:42.756
- This is my office.
- Wewon't stain anything. Don't worry.

14:51.211 --> 14:53.219
I don't like that guy.
Do you like that guy?

14:53.344 --> 14:54.392
No, he's creepy.

14:54.578 --> 14:57.437
- He's trying to take care of you.
- I don't get taken care of by dudes.

14:58.143 --> 14:59.105
Hey, I get it.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.178
Murray wants on his roster.

15:01.303 --> 15:04.613
I make so much money that it ain't gonna
mean nothing to give him a commission.

15:04.977 --> 15:06.782
But I want something in return.

15:07.290 --> 15:10.018
- What is it?
- Don't think I'm weird.

15:10.201 --> 15:12.619
- Anything, bob.
- Promise you won't call me weird?

15:12.787 --> 15:14.562
Say it.
I won't call you weird.

15:14.687 --> 15:17.332
- I want to have sex in Murray's office.
- What?

15:18.168 --> 15:21.095
I want to fuck her
in Murray's office.

15:25.310 --> 15:26.800
I get it, bob.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.969
- I'm sorry we wasted...
- No, I'm serious.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.409
I'm not weird, i'm pragmatic.
This would be great for my memoirs.

15:32.534 --> 15:35.183
Murray Berenson, the guy's a legend.
Fucking on his couch?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.351
You serious, bob?

15:36.519 --> 15:38.607
Do I ever tease
when I'm talking about fucking?

15:40.624 --> 15:42.524
I'm serious.
I'm not weird.

15:42.829 --> 15:44.079
Think about it.

15:48.002 --> 15:49.858
Thanks for taking
the time to see me.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.502
Of course. Turtle told me
you were freaking out.

15:52.627 --> 15:54.479
But I'm not sure what I can do.

15:54.604 --> 15:57.833
Just speak the truth and I'll have
my lawyer write everything down.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.379
Johnny, the truth is

15:59.504 --> 16:01.968
Dan Coakley didn't say
anything inappropriate to me.

16:02.093 --> 16:04.170
- He was all about business.
- Impossible.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.362
- He's got a pilot he wants me to do.
- He wants to do you, jamie.

16:07.487 --> 16:09.050
- Wake up.
- Drama!

16:09.236 --> 16:11.630
I'm not saying he doesn't want you
to do the pilot also.

16:11.755 --> 16:13.680
- But do you know what he said to me?
- I do.

16:14.070 --> 16:16.576
And I so appreciate
you sticking up for me.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.060
But he didn't say
any of those things to me.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.854
He's trying to lure you in.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.174
That won't happen.

16:22.299 --> 16:24.476
Maybe you can lure him in.

16:24.601 --> 16:26.614
- What do you mean?
- Go visit him.

16:26.739 --> 16:29.281
Wear something sexy, smell nice.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.139
Get him a little excited maybe.

16:31.264 --> 16:33.314
- Maybe wear a wire?
- Would you?

16:35.748 --> 16:38.129
I know the spot you're in,
and I feel so bad

16:38.254 --> 16:40.206
because I was involved
in causing it,

16:40.625 --> 16:42.794
but he really didn't
do anything to me.

16:43.345 --> 16:44.544
I'm really sorry.

16:45.627 --> 16:46.777
I understand.

16:47.703 --> 16:48.923
What are you gonna do?

16:49.665 --> 16:50.815
I don't know.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.757
You don't have to feel bad.
It's not your fault.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.892
- <i>I know, but I do feel bad.</i>
- That's because you're a good person.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.394
- I try to be.
- <i>Drama's got his demons.</i>

17:01.562 --> 17:04.064
He's got to work them out,
unfortunately. How's my boy?

17:04.232 --> 17:06.650
He's good.
He's trying to drive.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.464
- <i>What are you guys doing?</i>
- Me and Vince are looking for guns.

17:09.589 --> 17:11.938
- <i>For what?</i>
- For protection, what else?

17:12.063 --> 17:13.114
<i>You will end up</i>

17:13.281 --> 17:15.109
like Plaxico shooting yourself.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.095
Why does nobody think
I can handle a gun?

17:17.220 --> 17:19.329
- 'cause you're not that type.
- <i>You don't know</i>

17:19.497 --> 17:21.739
the tough guy roots from whence I came.
Tell her.

17:21.864 --> 17:23.842
- He's a killer, Jamie.
- You hear that?

17:23.967 --> 17:24.751
<i>I did.</i>

17:24.928 --> 17:27.571
But try not to kill yourself
or Vince, please.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.042
<i>I promise I won't.
I'll call you later, okay?</i>

17:32.277 --> 17:34.787
- She's worried.
- I don't see why.

17:36.175 --> 17:38.098
Sir, we'll take
a whole bunch of these.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.250
Good choice.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.601
So what do you do,
just brown paper bag it and we're off?

17:41.769 --> 17:44.229
Unfortunately we got a 10-day
waiting period in California.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.773
10 days?
We got to protect ourselves now.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.609
- Call your government.
- What can we get to tide ourselves?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.077
You like knives?

17:56.076 --> 17:57.875
- You are fucking with me.
- I'm not.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.637
You're trying
to put me in a bad spot.

17:59.762 --> 18:02.107
You make me look bad,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

18:02.232 --> 18:04.882
I've been here four hours.
You want to fight me?

18:05.315 --> 18:07.105
You want to rep Saget,
he's all yours.

18:07.230 --> 18:09.907
I'm trying to explain to you exactly
what it is that you're dealing with.

18:10.032 --> 18:12.674
I understand. And I'm trying to explain
to you that I'm not buying it.

18:13.512 --> 18:16.302
- What?
- I teed this one up for you, all right?

18:16.470 --> 18:18.537
You got tosell Murray
on it and the credit's yours.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.882
Yeah, I get it.
All I got to do is tell Murray

18:21.007 --> 18:23.009
that bob Saget wants
to fuck in his office.

18:23.134 --> 18:25.811
I don't believe it
and I'm just not gonna do it.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.324
Then I will.

18:33.149 --> 18:34.654
What are you doing, Drama?

18:35.310 --> 18:38.658
I'm desperate. You've known me 3 years.
You know I'm a good guy.

18:38.835 --> 18:40.838
You know I take my job
very seriously.

18:40.963 --> 18:42.638
And there's no way I can let you on.

18:42.763 --> 18:45.331
See this gift basket over here?
It's yours if you do.

18:45.918 --> 18:48.094
What's it got,
fruit or some bullshit in there?

18:48.219 --> 18:50.976
Three different ipods,
cherry-infused Godiva chocolates,

18:51.101 --> 18:52.937
Peter Thomas Roth wrinkle peel pads,

18:53.062 --> 18:54.957
- cookies from Deluscious...
- Cookies?

18:56.075 --> 18:57.093
Chocolate chip?

18:57.951 --> 18:59.846
Sprinkles cupcakes too.

19:01.614 --> 19:04.382
Go on. You tell 'em you
went through gate 4 if you're caught.

19:04.507 --> 19:05.557
You got it.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.008
Dan Coakley's office.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.140
Mr. Chase!
Mr. Chase, you can't go in there!

19:23.563 --> 19:25.038
Gorgeous, I've got to go.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.375
You really want
to destroy your life?

19:30.174 --> 19:31.336
I came here

19:31.705 --> 19:33.046
to offer a real apology.

19:33.446 --> 19:35.173
This morning you were right.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.802
I was insincere.

19:36.927 --> 19:39.556
I was making excuses for my actions.

19:40.487 --> 19:41.937
See, Dan, I have...

19:42.339 --> 19:44.252
impulse control issues

19:44.524 --> 19:48.333
topped with anger management problems
mixed in with desperate insecurities.

19:48.758 --> 19:51.900
Constantly I feel the need
to overcompensate.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.508
I don't know if it's because I felt
ma loved my brother more than me

19:55.633 --> 19:58.273
or because my father started
calling me a pussy at age three.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.947
But here I am exposed to you

20:00.072 --> 20:03.284
offering you my sincere,
most heartfelt apologies.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.453
I just... when you said those things

20:05.622 --> 20:08.399
that you said about
my buddy's girlfriend, I...

20:09.258 --> 20:11.819
You know what you said.
Right? I mean...

20:12.616 --> 20:14.379
Tell me again what you said, Dan.

20:15.498 --> 20:17.087
It's cool. I won't get mad.

20:17.212 --> 20:19.759
You can tell me.
Tell me again what you said.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.612
What are you doing, john?

20:22.600 --> 20:23.429
What?

20:24.439 --> 20:27.350
What, are you...
Are you recording this or something?

20:27.681 --> 20:28.474
What?

20:28.599 --> 20:31.604
I've produced enough bad cop shows
to know when somebody's wearing a wire.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.984
- What's in your pocket?
- Nothing.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.356
I see something.

20:38.015 --> 20:39.779
- That's my cell phone.
- Take it out.

20:41.634 --> 20:42.734
Take it out.

20:43.593 --> 20:45.861
- Dan.
- John.

20:54.048 --> 20:56.597
Don't fire me. Please please,
this job is everything to me.

20:56.722 --> 20:59.799
It's all I've got. I've worked
18 years to get to this position.

20:59.976 --> 21:01.801
I know I got problems.
I know it.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.512
I'll work on it.
I'll paint your house.

21:04.821 --> 21:07.397
I'll wash your car.
Please, Dan, I'm at your mercy.

21:07.522 --> 21:09.222
- Please!
- Get up.

21:13.624 --> 21:16.399
- I'm not gonna fire you.
- You're not?

21:16.567 --> 21:18.318
You got a stay of execution
from Burns.

21:18.486 --> 21:19.736
- Really?
- Plus...

21:19.904 --> 21:23.698
I kind of figured that if I do fire you
you might find a job somewhere else.

21:24.060 --> 21:26.868
- So what does this mean?
- It means I'm going to torture you.

21:27.339 --> 21:28.328
How?

21:28.714 --> 21:30.272
Tune in next week.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.753
So, day one, how's it going?

21:34.878 --> 21:37.057
Really good.
I really like the energy of the place.

21:37.182 --> 21:39.588
- That's good.
- Plus I've been alone so long

21:39.713 --> 21:42.677
it's nice to feel like a real person,
have people to talk to about things.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.511
It's a great team.
What did you want to talk to me about?

21:46.244 --> 21:48.378
- What about him?
- Well, we had a meeting.

21:48.503 --> 21:50.803
On day one? I love it.
How'd it go?

21:51.136 --> 21:54.133
- Well, do you know Bob at all?
- No. Did you close him?

21:54.258 --> 21:56.646
No, but we're right there.
But do we really want him?

21:56.771 --> 21:58.560
He's a big earner.
Why wouldn't we?

21:58.685 --> 22:00.080
Well, he's strange.

22:00.205 --> 22:02.862
Who isn't in this town?
Talk to me, Eric.

22:03.662 --> 22:06.398
- This is really uncomfortable.
- It shouldn't be.

22:11.069 --> 22:13.539
Bob Saget would like
to have sex in your office.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.809
- What?
- He said it'd be good for his memoirs.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.488
And he'll sign with us if we'll...

22:17.871 --> 22:18.892
Or if you'll...

22:19.017 --> 22:20.017
let him

22:20.423 --> 22:23.132
are you asking me if Bob Saget
can fuck in my office?

22:23.570 --> 22:25.343
I'm just repeating the information.

22:26.033 --> 22:27.512
Maybe I made a mistake with you.

22:28.235 --> 22:31.349
This isn't a whorehouse, Eric.
This is my office.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.712
I built my business sitting
right here at this desk.

22:34.990 --> 22:38.273
And you want to have
Bob Saget defile it.

22:38.975 --> 22:42.660
No, look, I just... You wanted Bob Saget
and this is what he asked for.

22:45.507 --> 22:46.395
Jesus, Eric.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.950
You really make a fuckface
when you're scared.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.817
- What?
- Bring him in. I don't give a shit.

22:51.942 --> 22:54.455
My ex-wife decorated
this place anyway.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.917
- Really?
- Get a cleaning crew in here after.

22:59.529 --> 23:01.452
- Good first day?
- Real good.

23:01.577 --> 23:04.926
Great. Maybe tomorrow you'll
go get Christian Bale.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.427
We'll let him execute
a cinematographer if he wants.

23:07.951 --> 23:08.970
See you later.

23:12.257 --> 23:13.846
At least you still have your job.

23:13.971 --> 23:16.207
Yeah, but I can't imagine
what this guy's planning.

23:16.332 --> 23:18.940
Johnny, just give it a couple of weeks.
I'm sure it'll subside.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.474
Whatever.
I'll be fine.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.460
Right now I'm worried
about my baby bro.

23:22.585 --> 23:23.901
Don't.
I'll be fine too.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.519
I know you will be.

23:26.127 --> 23:27.596
So where'd you get these?

23:27.721 --> 23:29.787
- John Milius' garage sale.
- Are they loaded?

23:29.912 --> 23:31.190
Of course, bro.

23:31.315 --> 23:33.519
You can't protect yourself
with an empty gun.

23:33.644 --> 23:35.404
So we're gonna shoot
if he comes back?

23:35.529 --> 23:37.589
Would you rather wait
for the cops to come back

23:37.714 --> 23:40.397
and find us tied up
and drained of all our blood?

23:41.425 --> 23:43.337
Where's my drink,
you muttering, stuttering...

23:43.505 --> 23:46.090
It's not a toy, you fucking idiot.
It's a loaded weapon.

23:54.568 --> 23:56.309
We should call Ari's security guy.
