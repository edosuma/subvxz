00:38.758 --> 00:41.249
Billy Boy!
Get your ass ready.

00:41.327 --> 00:44.194
It's almost 5:00, and this bad boy
needs to get his drink on.

00:44.264 --> 00:46.357
- No, no, no. Give me that.
- Don't.

00:46.432 --> 00:48.662
- I'm gonna burn it once and for all.
- Stop that.

00:48.735 --> 00:51.363
Dude, it's been six months.
It's time to move on, okay?

00:51.437 --> 00:53.598
Whatever. Even if
I wanted to meet other women,

00:53.673 --> 00:54.970
I wouldn't even know what to do.

00:55.041 --> 00:56.941
I've been out of the game
for so long.

00:57.010 --> 01:00.002
Dude, you come out with me tonight,
I promise you will get laid.

01:00.079 --> 01:02.138
Yeah, it sounds very tempting,

01:02.215 --> 01:04.012
but Berenson needs me to update
these financial models

01:04.083 --> 01:05.744
for the meeting
with the foreign investors.

01:05.818 --> 01:07.285
So what?
It's Friday night.

01:07.353 --> 01:09.082
The Germans are taking
an early flight back.

01:09.155 --> 01:10.747
The meeting got changed
to tomorrow.

01:10.823 --> 01:12.654
So? Why don't you
just get somebody else

01:12.725 --> 01:14.283
to do your work for you?

01:14.360 --> 01:15.588
Who?

01:15.662 --> 01:19.689
Harold, I need you to update
those models for me.

01:19.766 --> 01:22.394
- Billy, aren't you supposed to...
- I know. Something just came up.

01:22.468 --> 01:24.561
I have this meeting
with these new clients tonight,

01:24.637 --> 01:27.435
and I'm never gonna have time
to get to those.

01:27.507 --> 01:30.067
So that's your
responsibility now, big boy.

01:30.143 --> 01:32.907
Make sure those are in
by 9:00 sharp tomorrow.

01:32.979 --> 01:35.277
With all the downsizing
that's been going on around here,

01:35.348 --> 01:38.476
we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson
you've been slacking, now would we?

01:45.358 --> 01:46.882
Yeah.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.860
Okay, no problem.

01:48.928 --> 01:50.293
Hey.

01:50.363 --> 01:52.695
You have a great weekend,
okay, buddy?

01:52.765 --> 01:55.393
I owe you one.
Just one.

01:55.902 --> 01:56.891
Thank you.

02:05.278 --> 02:08.805
Wow! That was amazing.
I cannot believe how easy that was.

02:08.881 --> 02:11.042
Dude, how do you think
I get all my shit done?

02:11.117 --> 02:13.278
I'm telling you, those Asian guys
love crunching numbers.

02:13.353 --> 02:15.344
You probably
just made his weekend.

02:17.256 --> 02:18.655
<i>Chick magnet</i>

02:18.725 --> 02:21.387
<i>Chick magnet. Chick magnet</i>

02:21.461 --> 02:23.793
<i>Chick magnet. Yeah</i>

02:23.863 --> 02:25.160
Fuck.

02:26.032 --> 02:27.761
An excellent point, Mr. Patel.

02:27.834 --> 02:30.359
You are one of the finest applicants
I have ever interviewed.

02:30.436 --> 02:31.630
Thank you.

02:31.704 --> 02:35.731
It comes as no surprise. Your father
is highly respected in his field.

02:35.808 --> 02:37.469
As you probably heard
from your old man,

02:37.543 --> 02:40.671
he and I had some pretty wild times
back in med school.

02:40.747 --> 02:41.907
Really?

02:41.981 --> 02:45.007
Yeah. We started
our own basketball team...

02:45.084 --> 02:47.018
the Hemoglobin Trotters.

02:47.553 --> 02:50.113
Hemo-globin Trotters...
get it?

02:50.189 --> 02:55.559
A play on the name of the famous
colored, Negro basketball squad...

02:55.628 --> 02:57.858
black, African-American.

02:57.930 --> 03:00.660
You know, people of colors.

03:00.733 --> 03:04.328
Let's end up with one final question,
just as a formality.

03:04.404 --> 03:08.340
What are some potential
symptoms of pancreatitis?

03:08.408 --> 03:11.400
Well, you would have
epigastric tenderness,

03:11.477 --> 03:13.308
diffuse abdominal tenderness...

03:14.080 --> 03:16.344
I'm sorry.
Can you hold on one second?

03:18.284 --> 03:19.876
Kumar's phone.
Kumar speaking.

03:19.952 --> 03:21.715
Hey, what's up? It's me.
What are you doing?

03:21.788 --> 03:23.881
Nothing important. I can talk.
What's going on?

03:23.956 --> 03:28.222
Listen, I can't party tonight, okay?
I gotta stay late at the office.

03:28.294 --> 03:30.228
Dude, fuck that shit.
We had plans.

03:30.296 --> 03:32.321
I know, but I got
a lot of work to do.

03:32.398 --> 03:35.799
When has getting high ever
prevented you from doing your work?

03:35.868 --> 03:36.857
Jesus!

03:38.271 --> 03:40.535
<i>Believe me.
I would love to come home. Okay?</i>

03:40.606 --> 03:42.369
<i>- I got a lot of work to do.
- Thank you. I'll do that.</i>

03:42.442 --> 03:44.535
I got a quarter of the
finest herb in New York City.

03:44.610 --> 03:46.305
I'm not smoking
that shit alone, okay?

03:46.379 --> 03:49.109
So you need to just chill the fuck out
and prepare to get blazed

03:49.182 --> 03:50.774
because in the next couple of hours,

03:50.850 --> 03:52.977
I expect both of us to be
blitzed out of our skulls, got it?

03:53.052 --> 03:54.246
All right, I got it.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.754
I'll talk to you later.
Where was I?

03:56.823 --> 04:00.190
We've got the severe anal discharge,
sometimes violent... a.k.a. Diarrhea.

04:00.259 --> 04:03.092
Mr. Patel, I am more than familiar
with diarrhea.

04:03.162 --> 04:06.029
Do you actually believe
after the way you've just behaved

04:06.099 --> 04:08.829
that I would ever even consider
recommending you for admission?

04:08.901 --> 04:10.766
No. I'm gonna
be honest with you.

04:10.837 --> 04:11.826
The only reason I'm applying

04:11.904 --> 04:13.201
is so my dad
will keep paying for my apartment.

04:13.272 --> 04:14.933
I really don't have a desire
to go to med school.

04:15.007 --> 04:17.567
But you have perfect MCAT scores.

04:17.642 --> 04:19.611
Yeah. Just 'cause you're
hung like a moose

04:19.678 --> 04:21.374
doesn't mean you gotta do porn.

04:21.914 --> 04:23.939
Get out! Bernadette,
show this young man to the door!

04:24.016 --> 04:27.577
And please bring in
some fresh diarrhe... dry towels!

05:03.222 --> 05:04.484
Yes!

05:04.557 --> 05:06.787
Right in front of the door.

05:10.062 --> 05:11.996
This is America, dude!
Learn how to drive!

05:12.064 --> 05:13.429
Better "ruck" tomorrow!

05:15.668 --> 05:18.501
- Extreme!
- Fucking assholes.

05:20.006 --> 05:21.234
Fuck.

06:00.246 --> 06:01.679
Okay.

06:02.782 --> 06:06.274
Be yourself.
Don't be nervous.

06:24.971 --> 06:27.633
So, Maria, what's been goin' on?

06:27.707 --> 06:31.666
I actually had a very long week
at work. How about you?

06:31.744 --> 06:34.076
Work was good.
I caught up on some sleep.

06:34.146 --> 06:36.774
Plus, the guy who works next to me
decided to bathe for a change.

06:36.849 --> 06:38.146
Really?

06:38.217 --> 06:40.082
So what are you up to tonight?

06:40.152 --> 06:42.416
Actually, I'm just gonna
be sitting on my ass,

06:42.488 --> 06:44.149
probably eat a whole pint
of Haagen-Dazs

06:44.223 --> 06:45.417
<i>while I watch Blind Date.</i>

06:45.491 --> 06:48.119
Well, that sounds awful.

06:50.196 --> 06:51.663
If you want some company,

06:51.731 --> 06:54.564
maybe you can come over
and sit on your ass at my place.

06:55.768 --> 06:57.235
That sounds nice.

07:43.949 --> 07:45.314
Bye.

07:47.253 --> 07:49.278
Bye. Bye.

08:04.937 --> 08:06.131
Kumar.

08:06.205 --> 08:07.502
Yo.

08:13.813 --> 08:15.303
Yo, Kumar.

08:16.849 --> 08:18.441
Yo, I'm in here, dude.

08:26.158 --> 08:27.819
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

08:27.893 --> 08:30.157
I'm trimming my pubes.

08:30.229 --> 08:32.527
Why aren't you
doing this in your room, man?

08:32.597 --> 08:35.089
The mirror's in here.
Hey, check it out. It's like a bonsai tree.

08:35.167 --> 08:36.155
Hey!

08:36.235 --> 08:38.533
Besides, man, it makes
your johnson look totally bigger.

08:38.604 --> 08:40.332
Please!

08:41.240 --> 08:44.903
Are those my scissors?
Dude, I trim my nose hair with those!

08:44.977 --> 08:48.071
Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair
with them for the past six months.

08:51.417 --> 08:54.011
Get out!
Get out of my room.

09:03.229 --> 09:04.924
<i>Kumar. It's Daddy.</i>

09:04.997 --> 09:07.056
<i>I hope your interview
today was good.</i>

09:07.133 --> 09:09.567
<i>I'm calling to remind you
that you have another one tomorrow</i>

09:09.635 --> 09:13.093
<i>with Dr. Wein from Cornell
at 10 a.m. Do not be late.</i>

09:13.172 --> 09:15.367
- Hook it up, bi-yatch.
- Let's do it.

09:24.116 --> 09:25.549
Fuck!

09:29.255 --> 09:32.281
<i>In tonight's top story.
A cheetah escaped earlier today</i>

09:32.358 --> 09:34.121
<i>from the Morristown Zoo.</i>

09:34.193 --> 09:38.095
<i>Oh, nice.
Sixteen Candles is on, man.</i>

09:38.164 --> 09:40.564
And the award for the least
heterosexual statement

09:40.633 --> 09:44.034
ever made in this apartment
goes to... Harold Lee.

09:44.103 --> 09:46.571
Come on down, man.
Take a bow.

09:46.639 --> 09:48.607
Shut up, man.
It's a classic.

09:48.674 --> 09:50.699
It's a very beautiful story
about someone

09:50.776 --> 09:54.041
who feels unnoticed,
unappreciated, unloved, you know?

09:54.113 --> 09:55.978
- Turn it.
- It's a good one, though.

09:56.048 --> 09:57.072
Homo.

09:57.149 --> 09:59.413
<i>Come on. Dude.
Just take one hit.</i>

10:01.120 --> 10:02.485
<i>Don't you wanna be cool?</i>

10:07.893 --> 10:10.088
<i>Hey. Man.
What are you doin'?</i>

10:10.162 --> 10:12.221
<i>I'm so high!</i>

10:13.399 --> 10:14.798
<i>Nothing can hurt me.</i>

10:16.168 --> 10:17.999
<i>No!</i>

10:18.070 --> 10:21.096
<i>- Marijuana kills.
- I love that shit.</i>

10:21.440 --> 10:23.499
We're so high right now.

10:23.576 --> 10:24.941
We're not low.

10:25.010 --> 10:28.411
Dude, I don't know about you,
but I'm fuckin' hungry as balls.

10:28.481 --> 10:30.039
No shit, dude.
Let's eat.

10:30.115 --> 10:32.606
No, I don't feel
like delivery tonight.

10:32.685 --> 10:35.813
- What about KFC?
- We've been there too many times.

10:35.888 --> 10:38.584
I want something
we haven't had in a while.

10:39.158 --> 10:42.559
Something different,
something that'll really hit the spot.

10:43.596 --> 10:45.621
I want the perfect food.

10:45.698 --> 10:48.462
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

10:48.534 --> 10:52.095
<i>Then come to White Castle
and try our Slyder Special...</i>

10:53.472 --> 10:57.738
<i>Six burgers. Fries.
And a soft drink for only $2.99.</i>

10:58.944 --> 11:03.040
<i>Imagine all those burgers
in your stomach right now.</i>

11:06.852 --> 11:10.117
<i>Don't you like food
that's tasty and delicious?</i>

11:10.189 --> 11:11.247
I do.

11:11.323 --> 11:13.291
<i>Then what are you waiting for?</i>

11:13.359 --> 11:16.453
<i>Head over to White Castle.
It's what you crave.</i>

11:18.097 --> 11:20.190
You sure you know
how to get there?

11:20.266 --> 11:22.291
I haven't been
to White Castle in ages.

11:22.368 --> 11:24.928
Dude, I'm telling you, there's one right by
that multiplex in New Brunswick.

11:25.004 --> 11:25.993
Nice.

11:26.071 --> 11:27.561
- Rosenberg!
- Goldstein!

11:28.207 --> 11:32.268
Yo, Manny and Shevitz, get up.
We're going to White Castle.

11:32.344 --> 11:35.142
<i>No, we're watching
The Gift on HBO.</i>

11:35.214 --> 11:36.977
No, no, no.
No watching. We're starving.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.278
Hey, put that back.

11:39.351 --> 11:41.615
No eating until we get
to White Castle. Let's roll.

11:41.687 --> 11:43.416
Sorry, kids,
we ain't going nowhere.

11:43.489 --> 11:45.719
Supposedly Katie Holmes
shows her titties in this movie.

11:45.791 --> 11:47.986
Is that all you Jews
ever think about... tits?

11:48.060 --> 11:51.461
Katie Holmes is a nice,
respectable, wholesome girl.

11:51.530 --> 11:54.363
And I'm gonna see her boobs.

11:54.433 --> 11:57.402
The things I would eat
out of her ass... you have no idea!

11:58.237 --> 12:00.000
That is
a completely vulgar statement.

12:00.072 --> 12:03.007
So is "I want to bang Britney Spears
on the bathroom floor."

12:03.075 --> 12:04.838
But it's true.

12:04.910 --> 12:05.899
Touche.

12:05.978 --> 12:07.206
Hey, listen, if...

12:10.516 --> 12:12.313
<i>I think Kumar's a faygele.</i>

12:12.384 --> 12:14.511
They're totally gay for each other.

12:14.587 --> 12:16.953
- Hey, you wanna suck on this?
- Uh-huh.

12:18.757 --> 12:19.849
What the hell are you
bringing your bag for?

12:19.925 --> 12:21.984
Try to get some work done
in the car.

12:22.061 --> 12:24.461
- Here, you're driving.
- Shit, I forgot my cell phone.

12:24.530 --> 12:26.657
You wanna run back and get it?

12:32.271 --> 12:34.364
No, we've gone too far.

12:35.274 --> 12:37.208
Hey, there's your girlfriend.

12:37.276 --> 12:38.766
You gonna talk to her this time,

12:38.844 --> 12:41.039
or are you gonna be
a Vagina McGinastein about it?

12:42.681 --> 12:43.943
What the hell are you doing?

12:44.016 --> 12:45.381
You could've asked her if she wanted
to come to White Castle with us.

12:45.451 --> 12:47.783
- Hold the elevator. Wait!
- Hey, how are...

12:49.521 --> 12:51.113
You're worthless.

12:51.824 --> 12:53.416
I'm not worthwhile.

12:53.492 --> 12:56.017
Just fucking talk to her once.
It won't be weird anymore.

12:56.095 --> 12:57.494
Look, it doesn't matter.

12:57.563 --> 13:00.361
The only girls who are interested in me
are girls I have no interest in.

13:00.432 --> 13:01.626
Like Cindy Kim.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.292
Speaking of Cindy,
she called earlier.

13:03.369 --> 13:06.031
One of those Asian clubs she's in
is throwing a party at her dorm tonight.

13:06.105 --> 13:08.164
God, she invites me to everything.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.403
So what? She's kind of fuckin' cute.
Let her touch your penis.

13:12.044 --> 13:13.409
Oh, look.

13:13.479 --> 13:15.538
It's the Brothers McFag.

13:15.614 --> 13:18.242
Let me guess... the one
with the purse is the catcher.

13:19.585 --> 13:22.213
Come on, guys, let's get ourselves
some fucking Mountain Dew.

13:22.287 --> 13:23.276
Extreme!

13:23.355 --> 13:25.448
Yeah, extreme assholes.

13:25.524 --> 13:27.116
Why do I
have to be the catcher?

13:27.192 --> 13:29.660
Dude, forget about those pricks.
Let's just get some food.

13:34.366 --> 13:37.460
I am so hungry. I'm gonna eat,
like, 20 of those burgers, man.

13:37.536 --> 13:42.166
Dude, fuckin' I will see your 20 burgers
and raise you 5 orders of fries.

13:44.376 --> 13:45.638
Dude, give me 35 cents.

13:52.651 --> 13:54.346
What's going on?
It didn't register.

13:54.420 --> 13:56.650
- What?
- Give me 35 more cents.

13:56.722 --> 13:59.953
- I don't have any more change.
- Should I just go through?

14:00.025 --> 14:02.516
No, no, I don't like
breaking the law.

14:02.594 --> 14:04.118
Yeah, I can see that.

14:05.330 --> 14:07.798
Hey, move your ass!

14:07.866 --> 14:09.993
- I'm sorry. Hold on.
- I'm going through.

14:10.069 --> 14:11.764
No, don't.
No. No. Hold on.

14:11.837 --> 14:14.704
Let me walk to a manned tollbooth
and I'll tell them what happened.

14:14.773 --> 14:17.708
- Sorry!
- Move, you fuckin' twat!

14:17.776 --> 14:19.744
- What's the fuckin' holdup here?
- Shit.

14:21.980 --> 14:24.710
Move, you retarded cocksucker!
Move!

14:25.517 --> 14:27.747
- Are you crazy?
- What?

14:29.221 --> 14:30.586
What are you doing?
Why you throwing the weed out?!

14:30.656 --> 14:32.886
- The cops are gonna catch us.
- No, they're not. Not for that.

14:32.958 --> 14:34.016
- Take this exit.
- What?

14:34.093 --> 14:35.253
- Take this exit!
- No!

14:35.327 --> 14:36.692
Dude!

14:36.762 --> 14:38.525
You know,
that was the last of our weed.

14:38.597 --> 14:41.088
Sorry. I get a little
paranoid sometimes.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.895
Now we're in Newark,
of all places.

14:42.968 --> 14:44.833
You know we're
gonna get shot.

14:44.903 --> 14:48.498
Maybe it's not as bad as they say.
Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.

14:48.574 --> 14:51.372
Check it out. Those guys
look like a lame version of us.

14:56.882 --> 14:58.076
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

15:03.622 --> 15:05.613
Let's get the fuck outta here.

15:06.892 --> 15:09.918
- Go! Go! Drive! Drive!
- Yeah, that was your fault.

15:09.995 --> 15:11.519
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

15:14.533 --> 15:15.898
Yo, check it out.
We're almost there.

15:15.968 --> 15:17.492
Thank God. I'm starving.

15:17.569 --> 15:21.562
- Hello, New Brunswick!
- Prepare to gorge yourself.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.972
You know...
We need some tunage for this.

15:24.042 --> 15:25.600
Presets. Use the presets.

15:25.677 --> 15:27.542
Oh, come on, dude,
your whole life is preset.

15:27.613 --> 15:28.978
Try something new.

15:30.849 --> 15:33.613
Where is this place? Isn't it
supposed to be right around here?

15:33.685 --> 15:36.210
- Chill. We'll find it.
- Wait a second... is that the multiplex?

15:36.288 --> 15:37.846
- Yes.
- Sweet!

15:37.923 --> 15:40.517
That means the White Castle
should be right around the corner.

15:42.261 --> 15:43.626
What the hell
is going on, Kumar?

15:43.695 --> 15:45.458
That does not look
like a White Castle to me.

15:45.531 --> 15:48.056
Uh-uh.
Dude, we gotta check this out.

15:52.838 --> 15:56.205
Hey, look here, fellas. You guys gonna
have to order from the drive-thru menu.

15:56.275 --> 15:58.300
What happened to the White Castle?

15:58.377 --> 15:59.366
What?

15:59.444 --> 16:01.344
There used to be a White Castle
right here in this location.

16:01.413 --> 16:02.402
Where is it?

16:02.481 --> 16:04.415
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, guys,

16:04.483 --> 16:06.883
but Burger Shack, they bought
this location about four years ago.

16:06.952 --> 16:07.941
God!

16:08.020 --> 16:09.783
Please tell me there's
another White Castle in town.

16:09.855 --> 16:11.413
- No.
- Are you sure?

16:11.490 --> 16:12.514
Do I look like the kind of brother

16:12.591 --> 16:14.149
that would be unsure
about something like that?

16:14.226 --> 16:16.592
Shit!
What are we gonna do?

16:16.662 --> 16:19.222
I don't know, man.
Should we just eat here?

16:19.298 --> 16:20.287
Hey. Psst.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.458
There's a White Castle that's
open 24 hours up in Cherry Hill.

16:25.537 --> 16:26.936
It's about
45 minutes from here.

16:27.005 --> 16:28.768
I can make the trip
if you're willing to.

16:28.841 --> 16:30.570
Kumar, I got a shitload
of work to finish.

16:30.642 --> 16:32.132
You got that
med school interview.

16:32.211 --> 16:34.509
Forget about the med school
interview. It's a non-issue.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.070
What do you mean
it's a non-issue?

16:36.148 --> 16:39.311
Ding-dong!
May I interject for a second?

16:39.384 --> 16:42.478
As a Burger Shack employee
for the past three years,

16:42.554 --> 16:45.546
if there's one thing I've learned,
it's that if you're craving White Castle,

16:45.624 --> 16:47.285
the burgers here
just don't cut it.

16:48.260 --> 16:53.994
In fact, just thinking about those
tender little White Castle burgers

16:54.066 --> 16:56.034
with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions

16:56.101 --> 16:58.331
that just explode
in your mouth like flavor crystals

16:58.403 --> 16:59.893
every time you bite into one...

17:02.507 --> 17:05.135
...just makes me want
to burn this motherfucker down.

17:06.244 --> 17:09.373
Come on, Pookie,
let's burn this motherfucker down!

17:09.448 --> 17:11.848
Come on, Pookie!
Let's burn it, Pookie!

17:11.916 --> 17:13.885
Let's burn this
motherfucker down!

17:13.952 --> 17:16.546
Let's burn it down!
Let's burn it!

17:19.156 --> 17:23.320
So you guys maybe should just
suck it up and go to White Castle.

17:24.695 --> 17:27.994
You can always get
your work done in the car.

17:28.532 --> 17:30.330
- Let's do it.
- All right. Awesome.

17:30.402 --> 17:33.565
Then listen, listen... no matter what,
we are not ending this night

17:33.639 --> 17:35.106
without White Castle
in our stomachs.

17:35.173 --> 17:36.367
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

17:36.842 --> 17:38.070
Wise choice.

17:38.143 --> 17:40.202
You guys might have
wanted to stay away

17:40.279 --> 17:42.645
from our special sauce tonight.

17:42.714 --> 17:45.342
Me and Pookie,
we added a secret ingredient.

17:47.619 --> 17:49.610
I'll give you a hint.

17:51.657 --> 17:52.749
It's semen.

17:56.428 --> 17:57.520
Semen.

17:57.596 --> 17:58.927
Animal semen.

18:07.906 --> 18:11.205
Dude, remember when Goldstein
used to work at that burger place?

18:14.346 --> 18:16.780
This is the most fucking confusing
movie I've ever seen...

18:16.848 --> 18:18.440
she's possessed,
she's not possessed.

18:18.517 --> 18:20.280
Dude, that rack better be stacked.

18:20.352 --> 18:22.616
- Tits! Tits!
- Boobies, boobies, boobies.

18:22.688 --> 18:24.883
Holy shit! Whoa!

18:24.957 --> 18:26.254
Those aren't real.
Yes, they are.

18:26.591 --> 18:29.082
You know, I'm almost
completely sober right now.

18:29.161 --> 18:31.186
I wish we had some more weed.

18:31.263 --> 18:32.855
Sorry.

18:32.931 --> 18:35.229
Princeton.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.200
- We're getting off here.
- Why?

18:37.269 --> 18:39.965
Because we're gonna sweet-talk
Cindy Kim into finding us some weed.

18:40.038 --> 18:41.027
- No.
- Why not?

18:41.106 --> 18:42.664
You talk to her on the phone
all the time.

18:42.741 --> 18:44.299
She calls me.
Then she rambles on

18:44.376 --> 18:47.174
about her East Asian
Students Club or whatever.

18:47.245 --> 18:48.576
Then I have to actually pretend
that I give a shit

18:48.647 --> 18:49.978
or else she calls me a Twinkie.

18:50.048 --> 18:51.242
A what?

18:51.316 --> 18:53.978
Twinkie... yellow on the outside,
white on the inside.

18:54.553 --> 18:55.815
Look, you Twinkie bitch,

18:55.887 --> 18:58.048
you were the one that threw
our weed out the window, okay?

18:58.123 --> 18:59.147
So we're going to Princeton,

18:59.224 --> 19:00.782
and it's your responsibility
to make sure we're high as shit

19:00.859 --> 19:02.622
by the time
we're eating those burgers.

19:02.694 --> 19:05.492
Forget it.
End of discussion.

19:05.564 --> 19:08.158
I am not seeing Cindy Kim.

19:08.233 --> 19:09.996
Harold, I'm so glad
you showed up.

19:10.068 --> 19:12.332
Yeah, me too.

19:12.404 --> 19:15.567
Did you like the hibiscus petals
I glued to the envelope I sent you?

19:15.640 --> 19:18.268
Yeah, they were nice.

19:19.845 --> 19:21.972
Hey, dude, you know
where I can get some green?

19:24.816 --> 19:27.478
Dude, you know where
I can get some chronic?

19:27.552 --> 19:29.986
Jesus, what the hell kind of
lvy League school is this?

19:30.055 --> 19:31.386
Man.

19:31.456 --> 19:32.718
Over here, man.

19:33.859 --> 19:35.190
You lookin' to toke up?

19:35.260 --> 19:36.625
- Yes.
- Yes?

19:36.695 --> 19:39.391
Thank Christ. Just give me
a dime of your finest sticky.

19:39.464 --> 19:42.865
You wanna see
sticky-icky, my friend?

19:44.536 --> 19:45.628
Oh, my God!

19:45.704 --> 19:47.296
Whoa, man!

19:47.372 --> 19:49.306
Don't touch, man.
That's not cool.

19:49.374 --> 19:51.035
You can't...

19:51.109 --> 19:53.168
Jeez! This is my baby!

19:59.885 --> 20:00.874
Yes?

20:00.952 --> 20:02.943
Kenneth Park,
class of 2004.

20:03.021 --> 20:04.010
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:04.089 --> 20:06.614
Is it true you're an analyst
for Brewster Keegan?

20:08.093 --> 20:09.492
Yes, I'm a junior analyst.

20:09.561 --> 20:11.028
Awesome!

20:13.031 --> 20:14.555
I told you, he's good.

20:18.703 --> 20:21.467
- Yes.
- This is actually a two-part question.

20:21.540 --> 20:23.872
I'm applying for a summer
internship at Brewster Keegan.

20:23.942 --> 20:27.241
I was wondering, a) what's it like
being an investment banker,

20:27.312 --> 20:29.940
and b) would you write me
a recommendation?

20:32.117 --> 20:34.381
Here. That's sixt... 80 bucks.

20:34.453 --> 20:35.852
- 80 bucks?
- Yeah, 80 bucks.

20:35.921 --> 20:38.389
Yo, this is worth 40 tops, bro.

20:38.457 --> 20:40.357
"Bro"?
I'm not your bro, bro.

20:40.425 --> 20:41.892
Okay, and that's 80 bucks.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.518
You don't feel like
getting high tonight?

20:43.595 --> 20:46.393
If you don't feel like getting high,
that's cool with me,

20:46.465 --> 20:48.524
because there's lots of people
around here. See this guy?

20:48.600 --> 20:49.589
Hey, loser.

20:49.668 --> 20:52.193
Hey, what's up, George?
I smoke buds with George all the time.

20:52.270 --> 20:54.238
What kind of hippie are you?

20:54.306 --> 20:56.934
What kind of hippie am I?
Man, I'm a business hippie.

20:57.008 --> 20:59.272
I understand the concept
of supply and demand.

20:59.344 --> 21:02.074
"What's it like
being an investment banker?"

21:02.147 --> 21:05.810
To be honest with you,
it's actually pretty aw...

21:09.254 --> 21:10.949
...awesome.

21:11.022 --> 21:12.011
Excellent!

21:12.090 --> 21:15.719
As for the recommendation,
I guess I can make a couple calls.

21:15.794 --> 21:18.228
Actually, Harold, we should
be getting to the party.

21:18.296 --> 21:19.763
We can discuss all this stuff
on the way there.

21:19.831 --> 21:21.389
- It's just down the hall.
- Okay.

21:21.466 --> 21:25.425
I'm sorry. I can't go.
I have to wait for Kumar.

21:25.504 --> 21:26.994
You'll see him when we're done.

21:27.072 --> 21:29.233
Trust me,
you're gonna love this.

21:29.307 --> 21:32.003
Kenny's mom dropped off
a big pot of kimchi jigae.

21:32.077 --> 21:34.568
It's really good.
It's delicious.

21:34.646 --> 21:35.704
Yeah?

21:35.780 --> 21:37.407
That's nice.

21:37.916 --> 21:39.907
- 80 bucks, okay?
- Okay.

21:39.985 --> 21:43.045
- Hello.
- Are you guys about to smoke?

21:43.121 --> 21:46.056
Yes, we're gonna smoke. Do you
wanna come back to my place?

21:46.124 --> 21:49.025
Please, like they want to go listen
to a bunch of Phish records

21:49.094 --> 21:51.289
while you read
your lame-ass poetry.

21:51.363 --> 21:52.921
Girls, you guys wanna hang out,

21:52.998 --> 21:55.091
maybe smoke a little weed
and have some fun?

21:55.167 --> 21:57.135
- All right.
- All right.

21:57.202 --> 21:59.067
My poetry's not lame.
It's really good.

21:59.137 --> 22:01.037
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- It's great.

22:01.106 --> 22:02.733
We're gonna eat before this gets cold.

22:02.807 --> 22:05.901
What you say we meet back
in our room in about 20 minutes?

22:05.977 --> 22:07.410
We're in room 109.

22:07.479 --> 22:10.915
109. Got it.
I'll see you ladies later, huh?

22:10.982 --> 22:12.279
Yes!

22:12.350 --> 22:16.514
109. We'll see
you ladies later. Yes!

22:17.055 --> 22:18.386
We're getting laid, bro.

22:21.927 --> 22:23.827
All right, I'll see you there, man.

22:25.096 --> 22:28.293
20... 20... 208?

22:28.366 --> 22:30.698
208. Yes! 208!

22:31.836 --> 22:33.827
Roldy, dude,
you gotta come quick.

22:33.905 --> 22:37.705
There's these two filthy pussies
just aching to get boned by us.

22:38.743 --> 22:42.042
I mean, there are these two
very lovely young pussies

22:42.113 --> 22:44.047
who would like to have
a chat with you and I.

22:44.115 --> 22:46.606
Sorry. Harold's coming with us.

22:46.685 --> 22:48.812
That's bullshit. He's coming with me.
Isn't that right, Roldy?

22:49.921 --> 22:51.650
- Let's go to the party.
- No, no, no. Fuck that.

22:51.723 --> 22:54.886
Here. This is Harold's understudy.
You can do whatever you want.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.222
Roldy, let's go.

22:57.229 --> 22:58.457
Sorry.

22:58.530 --> 23:00.361
I can't believe you were gonna
ditch me for the Joy Luck Club.

23:00.432 --> 23:01.865
You know what their parties are like.

23:01.933 --> 23:04.231
What do you want me to say?
I was under pressure.

23:04.302 --> 23:06.327
Just say no.
That's all it takes. Here.

23:06.404 --> 23:07.666
All right, take a hit of that.

23:07.739 --> 23:09.036
What's going on up there?

23:09.107 --> 23:11.507
Barracuda to Sparrow,
Barracuda to Sparrow.

23:11.576 --> 23:14.067
We got two high-fliers
on level three.

23:18.216 --> 23:20.707
I just wanna talk!

23:23.488 --> 23:24.921
Dude, in here, in here.

23:24.990 --> 23:26.480
Women!

23:26.558 --> 23:28.389
What if someone
finds us in here?

23:28.460 --> 23:30.951
Chill the fuck out. He's not gonna
look for us in the girls' bathroom.

23:33.531 --> 23:34.896
Shit! Come here.

23:35.533 --> 23:38.297
It worked on me. There's no reason
it shouldn't work on you.

23:38.370 --> 23:40.895
But your breasts look beautiful.

23:40.972 --> 23:43.873
I just want those
cute little ping-pong breasts.

23:43.942 --> 23:45.876
You know, that kind of go...

23:47.679 --> 23:49.510
Hurry up because I want
to go smoke weed

23:49.581 --> 23:51.378
with that dishy Indian guy.

23:51.449 --> 23:53.314
It's gonna be a few minutes.

23:53.385 --> 23:56.877
I'm about to have
the worst case of taco shits.

23:56.955 --> 23:58.388
Oh, God.

24:04.796 --> 24:06.821
Great, I think I've got
to go, too.

24:24.649 --> 24:27.982
Hey, Clarissa, do you want
to play battle shits?

24:28.053 --> 24:30.419
- Oh, my God!
- Battle shits?

24:30.488 --> 24:33.480
We haven't played that
since back at camp.

24:33.558 --> 24:35.526
I know, I know.
Wait for it.

24:41.299 --> 24:42.596
Hit.

24:45.704 --> 24:48.002
Scag! You sank my destroyer!

24:57.015 --> 24:58.004
Fuck!

24:59.751 --> 25:02.015
I can't take it anymore!

25:05.323 --> 25:06.790
Christy, are you still there?

25:09.561 --> 25:12.860
Damn! You sank my battle shit!

25:12.931 --> 25:14.421
Shit.

25:17.902 --> 25:18.926
Dude!

25:20.839 --> 25:22.807
She said in 20-10?

25:22.874 --> 25:25.104
Have you seen
a Korean guy around here?

25:25.176 --> 25:28.043
Yeah, only when
I open my eyes, though.

25:29.114 --> 25:30.308
'Tard.

25:33.051 --> 25:35.076
20-11.

25:43.261 --> 25:44.694
Yo, this party's bumpin'!

25:44.763 --> 25:47.527
- Who wants some Buda?
- Yeah!

25:47.599 --> 25:51.160
Holy shit! Kenneth Park,
class of 2004.

25:51.236 --> 25:54.467
Dude, I'm thinking you really screwed up
by not coming to this party.

25:54.539 --> 25:56.200
<i>I screwed up?</i>

25:56.274 --> 25:58.174
Can we have some pot brownies?

25:58.243 --> 26:00.336
I don't know.
I'm running a little low.

26:00.412 --> 26:01.777
A titty flash might persuade me.

26:01.846 --> 26:03.939
- Should we?
- I think you should.

26:04.015 --> 26:05.175
Okay.

26:07.752 --> 26:08.844
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.080
Hey, you!

26:10.889 --> 26:11.947
Shit!

26:12.023 --> 26:13.888
Hey!

26:15.226 --> 26:17.057
- Hey!
- Let's get 'em! Halt!

26:17.128 --> 26:19.392
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:19.464 --> 26:21.625
- Harold! Harold!
- No, no, no.

26:22.667 --> 26:24.100
- Hey, dude!
- Come here!

26:26.604 --> 26:28.094
Well, well, well.

26:28.173 --> 26:29.970
- What do we have here?
- Oh, no! That's my baby!

26:30.041 --> 26:32.373
Hold his throat and groin.
Come on, rookie.

26:32.444 --> 26:34.036
Should we go back
for the weed?

26:34.112 --> 26:35.511
Are you crazy?
Run! Run!

26:37.782 --> 26:40.774
I can't believe it, man.
We were this close to getting laid.

26:40.852 --> 26:42.285
Oh, dude,
you always exaggerate.

26:42.353 --> 26:44.821
The diarrhea twins definitely
would have had sex with us.

26:44.889 --> 26:47.289
What about Cindy? She was
looking kinda cute tonight, man.

26:47.358 --> 26:49.588
Cindy's fine.
It's just...

26:49.661 --> 26:50.650
- Just what?
- We...

26:50.728 --> 26:52.355
Oh, you'd rather have Maria.

26:52.430 --> 26:53.419
Look, it doesn't matter.

26:53.498 --> 26:55.762
I'm gonna end up with Cindy Kim
whether I like it or not.

26:55.834 --> 26:58.928
Can we just drop this and get
our asses to White Castle, man?

26:59.003 --> 27:01.130
Fine.
Maria.

27:04.242 --> 27:05.436
What are you doing?

27:05.510 --> 27:07.569
Daddy needs to urinate.

27:08.513 --> 27:09.605
Hurry up!

27:11.516 --> 27:13.143
I'm serious.
Don't take all night.

27:13.218 --> 27:14.651
All right.

27:56.027 --> 27:58.495
- Excuse me, I have to...
- Huh?

27:58.563 --> 28:02.556
I have to ask you.
Why are you peeing right here?

28:02.634 --> 28:03.828
What?

28:03.902 --> 28:06.564
I mean, why'd you pee
right next to me

28:06.638 --> 28:08.902
when you could choose
that bush or...

28:08.973 --> 28:10.941
This is a good bush to pee on.

28:11.943 --> 28:14.468
Why are you peeing on it?

28:14.546 --> 28:16.673
Well, no one was here
when I chose this bush.

28:16.748 --> 28:17.874
Oh.

28:17.949 --> 28:20.816
So you get to pee on it
and no one else does? Huh?

28:20.885 --> 28:23.217
- No, I just...
- This your bush?

28:23.288 --> 28:25.756
You have a special bond
with this bush?

28:25.823 --> 28:28.758
- No, I just thought that...
- You the king of the forest?

28:28.826 --> 28:30.054
- I'm sorry?
- What?

28:30.128 --> 28:33.825
Are you a fuckin' tree-hugger?
Is this your special bush?!

28:33.898 --> 28:36.423
Never mind. Forget it. I really
don't feel like getting stabbed tonight.

28:41.973 --> 28:43.201
Nice pubes.

28:46.945 --> 28:47.934
Thanks.

29:11.269 --> 29:13.260
Do you even know
where you're going?

29:13.338 --> 29:15.431
I'm gonna be honest,
I'm a little lost, but, you know,

29:15.506 --> 29:17.599
once we get back on the highway,
we'll be there soon, don't worry.

29:17.675 --> 29:19.006
We'd better.

29:20.111 --> 29:22.306
Shit. Now it's raining.

29:23.147 --> 29:24.444
Put on your wipers.

29:24.515 --> 29:26.073
What are you talking about?
It's just a little mist.

29:26.150 --> 29:28.414
Yeah, mist,
hence the mist setting.

29:28.486 --> 29:31.114
It's a safety issue, okay?
There we go.

29:31.189 --> 29:34.454
Thank you, Mr. Wizard.
What crawled up your ass?

29:34.525 --> 29:36.925
I'm completely on edge
right now, man.

29:36.995 --> 29:38.587
After all the shit that
we've been through tonight,

29:38.663 --> 29:40.654
I don't know
how much more I can take.

29:41.332 --> 29:43.664
Oh, shit! How the fuck
did that get in here?

29:43.735 --> 29:44.827
Oh, shit!

29:48.539 --> 29:51.269
He bit me!
I've got rabies!

29:52.877 --> 29:53.866
Oh, my God!

29:53.945 --> 29:56.106
Dude, get that fuckin'
cancer raccoon away from me!

29:56.180 --> 29:57.647
Open my window!

29:57.715 --> 30:00.309
Fuck you, raccoon!

30:02.754 --> 30:04.346
What the Christ?

30:05.089 --> 30:08.115
- Shit!
- Shit!

30:11.663 --> 30:13.494
Jesus! You all right?

30:13.564 --> 30:15.725
I don't know.

30:16.501 --> 30:17.900
Shit.

30:18.436 --> 30:19.994
Shit, dude,
he's coming over here.

30:21.105 --> 30:22.868
Probably some old blind bitch!

30:22.940 --> 30:26.842
- What the fuck are you doing?
- We're sorry. We're very sorry!

30:26.911 --> 30:29.641
- Holy shit!
- Goldstein?

30:29.714 --> 30:31.682
Dude, it's Rold and Kumar.

30:31.749 --> 30:34.309
Shit. What's going on, man?

30:34.385 --> 30:36.979
- What's up, dude? What's up?
- All right.

30:37.055 --> 30:38.454
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

30:38.523 --> 30:41.549
We got the munchies, so we
decided we'd go to Hot Dog Heaven.

30:41.626 --> 30:43.526
How about you?
How was White Castle?

30:43.594 --> 30:46.222
We haven't gotten there yet.
I think I may have rabies.

30:46.297 --> 30:48.231
Yo, dude, how were
Katie Holmes' tits?

30:48.299 --> 30:50.290
- You know the Holocaust?
- Yeah.

30:50.368 --> 30:52.302
Picture the exact
opposite of that.

30:52.370 --> 30:54.031
Nice.

30:54.972 --> 30:56.269
Boy, do you need a girl.

30:56.340 --> 30:58.001
If you guys
got the yellow fever,

30:58.076 --> 30:59.941
there's a rockin' Asian party
down at Princeton.

31:00.011 --> 31:01.376
Dude, I got the yellow plague.

31:01.446 --> 31:04.313
There's nothing sexier
than a hot Asian chick!

31:04.382 --> 31:06.043
Asian tits...
I wanna squeeze 'em!

31:06.117 --> 31:08.551
Stop. Don't do that.
Please, do not touch me.

31:08.619 --> 31:09.745
I'm very woozy.

31:09.821 --> 31:11.812
I think I have to go
to the hospital.

31:11.889 --> 31:13.880
You should go
to Beth Israel.

31:13.958 --> 31:16.290
- We gotta hit up this Asian joint.
- No, we don't.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.693
We got to go to Hot Dog Heaven.
No more detours along the way.

31:19.764 --> 31:21.561
- This is what I'm dealing with.
- Come on!

31:21.632 --> 31:22.929
I'm telling you,
hit up the Asian party.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.831
Did you leave the key in the car
with the engine running?

31:24.902 --> 31:25.994
Good luck.

31:26.070 --> 31:29.267
You don't have rabies. We're not
going to a hospital. You're fine.

31:39.951 --> 31:42.920
Uh... Yeah, I don't have rabies.

31:42.987 --> 31:45.615
Great. Let's just
get out of here.

31:46.591 --> 31:50.118
Hey, aren't those the guys
that got the shit kicked...

31:50.194 --> 31:52.958
I know. I know.
Let's just go.

31:54.665 --> 31:56.223
Just go.

31:56.901 --> 31:58.163
Kumar.

32:00.071 --> 32:02.232
- Hey, it's your dad and brother.
- Shit.

32:03.441 --> 32:06.103
No wonder you didn't want
to go to the hospital.

32:06.177 --> 32:07.701
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, Dr. Patel.

32:07.779 --> 32:09.747
- What's up?
- Saikat. What's going on?

32:09.814 --> 32:13.079
I hope you are here to apologize for
what you did in your interview today.

32:13.151 --> 32:14.743
What the hell's
wrong with you, Kumar?

32:14.819 --> 32:17.151
God! You're 22 years old.
When are you gonna grow up

32:17.221 --> 32:20.213
and stop this
post-college rebel bullshit?

32:20.291 --> 32:23.124
- Like your life is so hard.
- Eat my balls, Saikat.

32:23.194 --> 32:25.958
I will not tolerate this
business from you any longer.

32:26.030 --> 32:28.760
You have one more
interview tomorrow morning,

32:28.833 --> 32:33.497
and if I hear from Dr. Wein that you
were anything short of spectacular,

32:33.571 --> 32:35.368
I'll completely cut you off.

32:35.439 --> 32:37.498
- Dad, come on.
- Daddy is not coming on anything.

32:39.677 --> 32:42.305
You will be there,
and you will behave.

32:42.380 --> 32:45.781
I have put too much time
and energy into you

32:45.850 --> 32:48.614
to let you go
and fuck it all up!

32:56.194 --> 32:58.890
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry, guys.

32:58.963 --> 33:00.294
Wow, I'm sorry.

33:02.099 --> 33:04.465
Sorry.
It won't happen again, okay?

33:06.070 --> 33:07.560
Good.

33:07.638 --> 33:09.333
I will speak with you tomorrow.

33:09.407 --> 33:11.773
- Bye, Harold.
- Bye.

33:11.843 --> 33:13.105
See ya.

33:13.177 --> 33:14.474
Wow, man.

33:14.545 --> 33:16.706
I guess you're going
to med school after all, eh?

33:16.781 --> 33:19.841
Fuck that, dude.
Like I care what my dad thinks.

33:19.917 --> 33:21.179
I can't wait to see
the look on his face

33:21.252 --> 33:22.685
when he finds out I didn't go
to my interview tomorrow.

33:22.753 --> 33:25.153
If he wants to cut me off, fine.
I don't need his money.

33:25.223 --> 33:27.987
I don't understand.
You just hugged him.

33:28.059 --> 33:31.460
Yeah, I just needed to get
my hands on this.

33:31.529 --> 33:32.689
Access card.

33:32.763 --> 33:35.823
Two words for you, bro...
medical marijuana.

33:36.901 --> 33:37.925
No.

33:39.170 --> 33:41.434
Oh, this is stolen.

33:42.874 --> 33:44.865
If we get caught,
you are taking the blame.

33:44.942 --> 33:46.341
This is not my idea.

33:46.410 --> 33:48.605
We're not gonna get caught, okay?
We're gonna go get baked

33:48.679 --> 33:51.239
and then go eat just like we planned.
Now, just calm down.

33:51.315 --> 33:53.579
- We gotta find the pharmacy.
- Dr. Patel!

33:53.651 --> 33:55.516
Thank God I found you.
We have an emergency.

33:55.586 --> 33:58.180
Nurses, I need these two doctors
scrubbed, gloved,

33:58.256 --> 34:00.315
and ready for the O.R. Stat!

34:00.491 --> 34:02.959
- What the hell is going on?
- He probably thinks I'm my brother.

34:03.027 --> 34:05.359
Just don't worry about it.
Leave the talking to me.

34:05.429 --> 34:07.727
It's a godforsaken bloodbath.

34:07.798 --> 34:10.426
The patient was brought in
by EMS five minutes ago.

34:10.501 --> 34:12.799
As you can see, we have
three horrific gunshot wounds.

34:12.870 --> 34:13.859
It's a good thing
I found you two.

34:13.938 --> 34:15.599
All the other surgeons
are working on other patients.

34:15.672 --> 34:17.264
No, there's been a mistake.

34:17.341 --> 34:20.333
What Dr. Lee is trying to say
is that we need to sedate the patient...

34:20.411 --> 34:22.936
...or he could go into cardiac arrest.
- All right, I'll get the anesthesiologist.

34:23.014 --> 34:25.346
Hang on a second, nurse. What we
should probably use is marijuana.

34:25.416 --> 34:27.543
That'll sufficiently
sedate the patient for surgery.

34:33.591 --> 34:35.217
Marijuana?

34:36.092 --> 34:37.081
But why?

34:37.161 --> 34:38.650
We don't have time for questions.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.458
We need marijuana now,
as much of it as possible!

34:41.532 --> 34:42.965
Like a big bag of it.

34:43.034 --> 34:46.800
But, Doctor, we don't have
marijuana in this hospital.

34:46.871 --> 34:48.634
Shit.

34:48.706 --> 34:51.732
Oh, shit!
This guy's gonna die!

34:51.809 --> 34:54.277
Doctor, you've got to do something
or we're gonna lose him!

34:54.344 --> 34:55.812
I'm gonna do this
the old-fashioned way.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.110
Start the nitrous.
Give me two large-bore I.V. S

34:58.182 --> 35:00.047
and start a Ringers lactate push.

35:00.117 --> 35:01.141
Dr. Roldy, hold this.

35:07.224 --> 35:08.452
More gauze, please.

35:08.526 --> 35:11.893
- Doctor, the patient is desatting.
- Dude, he's desatting! He's desatting!

35:11.963 --> 35:14.761
The patient has a collapsed lung.
I need a 14-gauge angiocath stat.

35:21.672 --> 35:24.072
- That was genius.
- Thank you.

35:24.141 --> 35:25.938
- Great job!
- You guys did it.

35:26.010 --> 35:27.068
No, it's you.

35:28.579 --> 35:30.877
- Sexy.
- What'd you say?

35:30.948 --> 35:32.108
Nothing.

35:32.183 --> 35:33.275
Sweet-pea.

35:35.252 --> 35:37.345
The patient appears
to be stabilized.

35:37.421 --> 35:40.117
- Good work, doctors, all around.
- Great. One of you clean this up, please.

35:40.191 --> 35:42.455
- Put the chest tube in.
- Meow. You're moist.

35:42.526 --> 35:44.824
- I'm not sweating anymore.
- You're glistening.

35:44.895 --> 35:47.693
Soft and chocolate lips...

35:47.765 --> 35:51.531
- Could I get a little dab here?
- Hush now, hush now.

35:51.602 --> 35:54.036
Excuse me, sir.
Do you happen to know

35:54.105 --> 35:56.164
how to get to the White Castle
in Cherry Hill from here?

35:56.240 --> 36:01.041
Yeah. Take the 33 west
and take the Turnpike south,

36:01.112 --> 36:02.409
and there you are.

36:02.747 --> 36:04.647
I'm telling you, man,
that was amazing!

36:04.715 --> 36:06.410
Even your dad would
have been impressed, man.

36:06.484 --> 36:08.111
Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

36:08.185 --> 36:12.554
This is perfect. We're back on the road,
we got directions, it stopped raining.

36:12.623 --> 36:13.817
And guess what, man.

36:13.891 --> 36:17.622
- I'm officially done with my work.
- Oh, yeah? Nice!

36:17.695 --> 36:20.357
I'm telling you, dude,
things are finally starting to go our way.

36:22.233 --> 36:23.996
<i>Hey, dude, check it out...
Sixteen Candles.</i>

36:24.068 --> 36:25.626
Isn't that your favorite movie?

36:25.703 --> 36:26.829
Wow, man, that's awesome!

36:28.739 --> 36:31.230
Yo, look who decided
to go see it.

36:31.308 --> 36:32.502
Holy shit.

36:32.576 --> 36:35.010
See! You said you two
had nothing in common,

36:35.079 --> 36:37.172
but you both have the same
lame taste in movies!

36:37.248 --> 36:38.647
Shut up.

36:38.716 --> 36:40.513
Hey, we should ask her if she
wants to come to White Castle.

36:40.584 --> 36:43.212
No. No, no.
Forget about it. Just drive.

36:43.287 --> 36:45.050
Dude, come on.
It's 1:00 in the morning.

36:45.122 --> 36:46.783
We're an hour away from home,

36:46.857 --> 36:49.917
and who do we see but your dream girl
standing across the street?

36:49.994 --> 36:52.861
Just pretend you're a nerdy
Asian version of Tom Hanks

36:52.930 --> 36:55.626
and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan
with bigger tits.

36:56.667 --> 36:58.601
The cars are going.
Can we go? How about that?

36:58.669 --> 37:00.899
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me, Maria!

37:00.971 --> 37:03.769
- What are you doing?
- Maria! Excuse me for a second!

37:03.841 --> 37:05.365
Come here!

37:05.776 --> 37:07.437
No! What the hell
are you doing?

37:07.511 --> 37:09.502
Get your hand off the gas!
Shit!

37:09.580 --> 37:11.514
- I'm stuck!
- Stop turning the wheel!

37:11.582 --> 37:13.675
- I am stuck!
- What do you mean you're stuck?

37:13.751 --> 37:14.809
Get unstuck!

37:26.597 --> 37:28.622
- You asshole!
- Wha... wha...?

37:28.699 --> 37:31.293
We could have seriously
injured ourselves, man!

37:31.368 --> 37:32.835
Yo, don't blame me, genius.

37:32.903 --> 37:35.394
I'm not the one who decided
to run us off the frickin' road, all right?

37:35.473 --> 37:37.236
Let's just get
back on the highway, okay?

37:37.308 --> 37:38.639
Fine with me.

37:46.183 --> 37:47.741
It's not funny.

37:57.294 --> 38:00.229
- Where's my spare tire?
- I don't know.

38:01.532 --> 38:03.500
Where the hell
is my spare tire?

38:03.567 --> 38:05.262
Oh, yeah!

38:05.336 --> 38:08.863
Dude, remember that time
we got really stoned

38:08.939 --> 38:12.636
and started throwing shit off
that bridge to see if it would float?

38:14.078 --> 38:16.410
What bridge? I don't remem...
What are you talking about?

38:16.480 --> 38:18.778
Oh, shit, that's right.
That was with Goldstein.

38:20.618 --> 38:22.609
We borrowed your car
that night. My bad.

38:22.686 --> 38:26.019
Your bad? What the hell
are we gonna do now?

38:29.693 --> 38:31.661
- Hey!
- Hey! Excuse me!

38:31.729 --> 38:34.163
- Hello! Over here!
- Excuse me!

38:44.441 --> 38:46.671
You boys need some help?

38:53.584 --> 38:55.984
Thanks for helping us out.

38:59.256 --> 39:00.689
No problem at all.

39:00.758 --> 39:04.854
I seen you two stranded
out there alone in the dark,

39:04.929 --> 39:08.160
and I said to myself...

39:08.232 --> 39:09.893
"What would Jesus do?"

39:09.967 --> 39:11.628
Goin' down to Georgia

39:11.702 --> 39:15.194
Gonna get myself baptized,
gonna get myself baptized

39:15.272 --> 39:18.070
In the bosom of the Lord

39:22.379 --> 39:25.371
Have you boys accepted Jesus
as your Lord and Savior?

39:25.449 --> 39:27.576
- Yes.
- Yeah, he's great. Cool guy.

39:27.651 --> 39:30.245
Praise the Lord
and pass the ammunition!

39:30.321 --> 39:34.052
Name's Randy,
but everybody calls me Freakshow.

39:34.124 --> 39:35.716
My name's Kumar.

39:35.793 --> 39:37.727
How are you, Kunie?

39:39.430 --> 39:41.455
- This is Harold.
- Hi, Jerald. How are you?

39:42.533 --> 39:44.899
So where exactly
are we going?

39:44.969 --> 39:48.063
Don't you worry about that none.
We ain't too far from my place.

39:48.138 --> 39:51.835
Once we get there, I'll have
your ride fixed up in a jiffy.

39:59.283 --> 40:01.581
Check out those boils
on his neck.

40:01.652 --> 40:03.711
You gotta look.
One of them's actually pulsating.

40:04.521 --> 40:08.582
Shut up. He's right next to me.
He can hear you.

40:08.659 --> 40:10.388
Now there's some sort of puss.

40:10.461 --> 40:11.758
- It's disgusting!
- Shut up.

40:11.829 --> 40:14.593
Just one little boil.
Just look at it.

40:22.940 --> 40:25.602
See, isn't that the most disgusting
thing you've ever seen?

40:25.676 --> 40:27.837
Do you think just
because you're whispering,

40:27.911 --> 40:30.903
he can't hear
what you're saying?

40:30.981 --> 40:33.882
He's two feet away from us.
He can hear this entire conversation.

40:33.951 --> 40:36.146
He can hear me
talking right now.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.881
Don't worry about it.
He can't hear anything...

40:37.955 --> 40:39.980
not with all that crust in his ear.

40:48.766 --> 40:50.825
I heard everything you said.

40:59.476 --> 41:02.036
It's gonna take me a while
to fix up your car there,

41:02.112 --> 41:06.310
so if you boys like,
you can go on inside,

41:06.383 --> 41:08.681
get yourselves something
to drink, wash up,

41:08.752 --> 41:11.277
fuck my wife, watch TV...
anything you want.

41:11.355 --> 41:14.882
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

41:14.958 --> 41:18.394
Just don't do anything
the Good Lord wouldn't do.

41:19.496 --> 41:20.485
Thank you.

41:22.066 --> 41:24.261
We're gonna die.
He's going to kill us.

41:24.335 --> 41:25.700
We're gonna die.

41:25.769 --> 41:28.932
Dude, am I deaf, or did he just say
we get to fuck his wife?

41:29.006 --> 41:30.769
He couldn't have said that.

41:33.077 --> 41:35.011
Who cares?
You've seen Freakshow.

41:35.079 --> 41:36.979
What do you think his wife
is gonna look like?

41:50.561 --> 41:52.324
Oh, hi, boys.

41:52.396 --> 41:54.921
I'm Freakshow's wife Liane.

41:55.632 --> 41:57.623
Can I get you some pink lemonade?

41:57.701 --> 42:00.795
Why don't you just go
have a seat in the living room?

42:00.871 --> 42:02.395
I'll be back in a jiffy.

42:02.473 --> 42:03.838
Thanks.

42:07.378 --> 42:10.347
- Hot. Hot!
- Uh-huh.

42:18.789 --> 42:20.484
Jesus Christ.

42:25.629 --> 42:29.156
Okay, it's official.
We've entered the Twilight Zone.

42:29.233 --> 42:32.259
- Dude, Liane is fucking hot.
- She's not ugly.

42:34.238 --> 42:35.671
Here you go, boys.

42:35.739 --> 42:36.933
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

42:37.007 --> 42:40.033
Liane, how are things between you
and Freakshow presently?

42:40.110 --> 42:43.409
Oh! They've never been better.
We love each other so much.

42:43.480 --> 42:48.383
I was just wondering,
how does a guy like Freakshow...

42:52.456 --> 42:55.721
...end up with a girl like you?

42:55.793 --> 42:59.889
Well, we met at choir practice
about four years ago.

42:59.963 --> 43:01.931
Freakshow was really shy
back then, you know,

43:01.999 --> 43:04.058
'cause of all his hideous boils
on his face and neck.

43:04.134 --> 43:05.396
Sure, sure.

43:05.469 --> 43:08.029
But he had
the most amazing voice,

43:08.105 --> 43:09.902
like a baby canary.

43:11.008 --> 43:13.067
The devil is everywhere

43:13.143 --> 43:16.010
Hey, Randy, what,
the devil, huh

43:16.079 --> 43:17.876
The devil is everywhere

43:17.948 --> 43:19.813
Hey, Randy, what

43:19.883 --> 43:23.080
After Easter service one day,
I told him how much I loved his solo

43:23.153 --> 43:25.087
and he finally mustered up
the courage to ask me out.

43:25.155 --> 43:27.248
We've been in love ever since.

43:27.324 --> 43:30.122
So, are you boys gonna
fuck me now or what?

43:32.563 --> 43:34.758
Rock, paper, scissors
to see who goes first. Ready?

43:34.832 --> 43:36.663
- Rock, paper...
- Wait a second.

43:36.733 --> 43:38.462
What about Freakshow?

43:38.535 --> 43:42.130
What? You assume we don't
know how to have a good time?

43:42.206 --> 43:43.798
I just...

43:52.850 --> 43:54.647
Never mind.
Rock, paper, scissors.

43:54.718 --> 43:58.745
Sorry, but if you boys want me,
you have to do me at the same time.

43:58.822 --> 44:01.814
- Huh?
- Come on, give me the double stuff.

44:01.892 --> 44:03.792
I'm not sure
we quite understand, Liane.

44:03.861 --> 44:07.262
I want you both
inside me simultaneously.

44:07.331 --> 44:09.322
- One hole or two?
- Whatever you want.

44:09.399 --> 44:11.959
Sorry. No, thank you.
No, thank you.

44:12.035 --> 44:14.003
Dude, if it's two holes,
it might not be that bad.

44:14.071 --> 44:15.800
- Shotgun anus.
- Forget it!

44:15.873 --> 44:17.773
I don't want our balls
rubbing against each other.

44:17.841 --> 44:19.706
- What, are you kidding?
- No way! Forget it.

44:19.776 --> 44:21.505
How about blow jobs?
Can we have blow jobs?

44:26.850 --> 44:28.477
Well, okay.

44:31.421 --> 44:32.547
Come here.

44:32.623 --> 44:35.319
Okay. I'm going up there.

44:35.392 --> 44:36.689
I wanna come, too.

44:36.760 --> 44:40.321
- Think you could help me with this?
- You need help?

44:41.632 --> 44:44.533
Okay, yeah.
It's a little sticky there.

44:44.601 --> 44:46.694
- You can do it.
- Okay.

44:46.770 --> 44:48.567
I can do it.
I can do it.

45:02.719 --> 45:04.653
Do you wanna play with them?

45:04.721 --> 45:05.710
Play with them.

45:07.291 --> 45:09.851
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

45:09.927 --> 45:11.792
Let's do that.

45:13.830 --> 45:16.856
Well, boys, I fixed your tire.

45:20.003 --> 45:21.368
Hi, honey.

45:21.438 --> 45:24.874
What in the hell
are you doing with my wife?

45:25.842 --> 45:28.936
You said outside that
we could have sex with her.

45:29.012 --> 45:30.274
Shit! Shit!

45:30.347 --> 45:33.248
- I most certainly did not.
- Yeah, you did.

45:33.317 --> 45:34.716
- I did not!
- You did.

45:34.785 --> 45:36.810
- Oh, no, I didn't!
- You did, you did.

45:38.522 --> 45:40.956
- You sure?
- You said it.

45:45.462 --> 45:46.451
My mistake!

45:46.530 --> 45:48.054
Freakshow.

45:48.131 --> 45:51.225
Well, since we're all here...

45:52.069 --> 45:54.060
...how about a foursome?

45:54.137 --> 45:56.071
Who wants the first reach-around?

46:04.615 --> 46:07.083
Okay, let's agree to never talk
about what just happened.

46:07.150 --> 46:08.242
Agreed.

46:08.318 --> 46:11.253
That's a very good idea.

46:11.321 --> 46:13.084
Dude, I have no idea
where we are.

46:13.156 --> 46:14.453
What?

46:16.026 --> 46:17.459
- Is that a hitchhiker?
- What the hell?

46:17.527 --> 46:19.927
- Should we pick him up?
- And get chopped to bits? Are you crazy?

46:19.997 --> 46:22.329
You know what? We're lost. He may
know how to get back on the highway.

46:22.399 --> 46:24.890
Get back on the road.
This is my car.

46:24.968 --> 46:26.629
We are not picking up
a hitchhiker, man.

46:26.703 --> 46:29.433
Hey, guys, thanks
for picking me up.

46:33.343 --> 46:36.005
Excuse me,
are you Neil Patrick Harris?

46:36.079 --> 46:37.068
Yep.

46:37.147 --> 46:39.172
- Oh, my God, what are you doing here?
- Holy shit.

46:39.249 --> 46:41.183
<i>Dude, Doogie Howser M. D. Was,
like, my favorite show growing up.</i>

46:41.251 --> 46:42.240
You were my idol.

46:42.319 --> 46:44.549
That's great. Could we get going?
I'm bored as shit back here.

46:45.222 --> 46:47.850
- Go, go.
- Let's go. This is a frickin' boring spot.

46:55.298 --> 46:57.994
So I gotta ask you, Neil,

46:58.068 --> 47:00.263
did you ever get it on
with Wanda off the set?

47:00.337 --> 47:02.931
Dude, I humped every piece
of ass ever on that show.

47:03.006 --> 47:04.701
Even the chick
who played the hot nurse?

47:05.776 --> 47:09.678
No. I didn't go
all the way with her.

47:13.050 --> 47:14.210
Neil, you wouldn't happen to know

47:14.284 --> 47:15.615
how to get on the highway
from here, would you?

47:15.686 --> 47:17.813
Dude, I don't even know
where the fuck I am right now.

47:17.888 --> 47:19.150
I was at this party earlier tonight

47:19.222 --> 47:21.952
and some guy hooked me up
with this incredible X.

47:22.025 --> 47:24.619
The next thing I know, I'm being
thrown out of a moving car.

47:24.695 --> 47:28.062
- I've been tripping balls ever since.
- That's crazy, dude.

47:28.131 --> 47:29.564
We've been having
a pretty crazy night, too.

47:29.633 --> 47:31.396
We've just been driving around
looking for White Castle,

47:31.468 --> 47:32.833
but we keep getting sidetracked.

47:32.903 --> 47:33.961
Yeah, dude, you fascinate me.

47:34.037 --> 47:36.005
Forget White Castle.
Let's go get some pussy.

47:36.073 --> 47:38.371
- Huh?
- It's a fuckin' sausage-fest in here.

47:38.442 --> 47:40.842
Let's get us some poontang.
Then we'll go to White Castle.

47:40.911 --> 47:41.969
No, Neil, you don't understand.

47:42.045 --> 47:43.979
We've been craving
these burgers all night.

47:44.047 --> 47:46.379
Yeah, I've been craving
burgers, too... fur burgers.

47:46.450 --> 47:49.510
Come on, dudes, let's pick up
some trim at a strip club.

47:49.586 --> 47:52.020
The Doogie line
always works on strippers.

47:52.089 --> 47:54.853
Lap dance.

47:55.625 --> 47:58.526
There's a gas station.
I'm gonna see if we can get directions.

47:58.595 --> 48:00.563
We don't need...

48:02.566 --> 48:06.195
Hurry up, dudes, hurry up.
I'm losing wood.

48:10.006 --> 48:12.839
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry, hurry.

48:12.909 --> 48:14.877
- Chill.
- We'll be right back, Neil.

48:14.945 --> 48:16.242
We'll be back.

48:22.352 --> 48:25.480
What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris?
Why is he so horny?

48:25.555 --> 48:28.683
I don't know, but we can't
let him interfere with our quest.

48:30.193 --> 48:33.424
- Oh, God.
- Shit, these punks again.

48:33.497 --> 48:35.124
Late-night Math League
meeting, homos?

48:35.198 --> 48:36.893
Extreme!

48:40.103 --> 48:41.365
Let's go.

48:51.181 --> 48:54.173
No, no.
Pies, pies... no.

49:00.423 --> 49:01.788
Dude, what is that?
Is that a pterodactyl?

49:01.858 --> 49:03.257
I do not know what that is.

49:03.326 --> 49:05.260
That was extreme, dude!

49:05.328 --> 49:08.491
Excuse me, can you tell us how
to get to the highway from here?

49:08.565 --> 49:09.691
Dude, I got this.

49:21.511 --> 49:24.002
Dude, who knew learning Hindi
would actually pay off?

49:24.080 --> 49:26.139
Guy says the highway is, like,
a couple traffic lights from here.

49:26.216 --> 49:28.150
We should be in Cherry Hill
in ten minutes.

49:28.218 --> 49:30.345
- Ready? One, two, three!
- No. No.

49:30.420 --> 49:32.513
- No.
- Extreme kayaking!

49:32.589 --> 49:34.056
No!

49:36.660 --> 49:37.957
Extreme!

49:43.099 --> 49:45.465
- No!
- Man, that was so fuckin' extreme!

49:46.169 --> 49:47.830
On a scale of 1 to 10,

49:47.904 --> 49:50.873
one being not so extreme
and ten being extremely extreme,

49:50.941 --> 49:52.909
I give this a 9.5!

49:54.477 --> 49:56.638
- Check it out!
- Extreme cheddar!

50:02.485 --> 50:04.976
- Hey.
- Extreme cashier!

50:06.389 --> 50:07.481
Somebody should do something.

50:09.192 --> 50:10.591
Yeah, you're right.

50:10.660 --> 50:13.288
Hey, asshole!
Why don't you leave that guy alone

50:13.363 --> 50:15.627
and go jerk off to some
snowboarding videos or something?

50:19.002 --> 50:20.867
<i>I didn't mean you
should do something about it.</i>

50:32.682 --> 50:34.513
What? You're gonna take that?

50:34.584 --> 50:37.451
What's up with that? Huh?

50:37.520 --> 50:39.249
You're gonna take that?

50:40.690 --> 50:41.714
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

50:41.791 --> 50:43.224
- Shit!
- That's right, bitch!

50:43.293 --> 50:45.727
You just try fuckin' with me
one more time!

50:45.795 --> 50:48.355
Just try it!
Thank you, come again.

50:51.334 --> 50:52.392
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

50:53.937 --> 50:55.928
Kumar, you okay?

50:56.006 --> 50:58.031
Yeah, dude,
I just hate those assholes.

50:58.108 --> 51:00.042
You know what? Fuck it, I'm hungry.
Let's just get outta here.

51:14.524 --> 51:17.493
Did Doogie Howser
just steal my fucking car?

51:20.997 --> 51:23.898
Yes. I think he did.

51:39.783 --> 51:42.513
You! You had to pick up
a hitchhiker! Why?!

51:42.585 --> 51:43.574
Calm down.

51:43.653 --> 51:45.086
Why did you leave
the keys in the car?

51:45.155 --> 51:46.713
Why? Because
it would get stolen.

51:46.790 --> 51:49.691
I figured that Neil Patrick Harris
was a trustworthy guy.

51:49.759 --> 51:51.522
Come on. How was I supposed
to know he'd fuck us over?

51:51.594 --> 51:54.427
This whole freaking night,
this whole night, is your fault!

51:56.266 --> 51:59.099
- Where are you going?
- I'm going inside to call the police.

51:59.169 --> 52:01.228
I don't want
to talk to you anymore.

52:03.974 --> 52:06.135
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

52:06.209 --> 52:08.006
There's a pay phone
across the street

52:08.078 --> 52:10.171
if you don't wanna
deal with those assholes.

52:23.860 --> 52:27.591
After we talk to the cops, we're
still going to White Castle, right?

52:27.664 --> 52:30.064
I'm not speaking to you.

52:30.133 --> 52:33.193
When are they fucking going
to develop button technology

52:33.269 --> 52:34.759
that will understand urgency?!

52:34.838 --> 52:38.171
- Dude, this is ridiculous. Just walk across.
- It'll change in a second.

52:38.241 --> 52:39.902
There's not a car in sight.
Just go ahead.

52:39.976 --> 52:43.173
Fine. You want me to cross?
I will cross.

52:43.246 --> 52:45.646
If it makes you happy,
I will cross.

52:46.683 --> 52:47.775
I'll do it.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.285
Shit!

52:54.355 --> 52:56.983
- What...
- Sorry.

53:00.194 --> 53:02.754
Is there a problem,
Officer Palumbo?

53:02.830 --> 53:05.025
Is there a problem?
You ever heard of jaywalking?

53:05.099 --> 53:06.862
Yes, I have. I'm really sorry.
Won't happen again.

53:06.934 --> 53:08.959
That's great.
I'm writing you up a ticket.

53:09.037 --> 53:10.436
A ticket?
Are you serious?

53:10.505 --> 53:12.473
Who the fuck are you, shitwad?

53:12.540 --> 53:15.134
Let me apologize
for my friend here. I'm very sorry.

53:15.209 --> 53:17.109
I'm really glad you're here.
We've had a rough night.

53:17.178 --> 53:18.941
<i>You know the show
Doogie Howser M. D.?</i>

53:19.013 --> 53:22.312
Great show.
God, I love that show. "Doogie."

53:22.383 --> 53:24.851
Neil Patrick Harris
stole my car tonight.

53:24.919 --> 53:27.080
Hey, NPH wouldn't do that,
all right?

53:27.155 --> 53:28.486
Give me some I.D.

53:28.556 --> 53:30.888
Excuse me, how can you
give him a ticket for jaywalking?

53:30.958 --> 53:34.450
It's 2:30 in the morning.
There's not a car around here.

53:34.529 --> 53:35.655
Kumar, shut up.

53:35.730 --> 53:36.992
That's not the kind of tone
you want to use

53:37.065 --> 53:38.555
on a cop who can bust your ass.

53:38.633 --> 53:41.227
- Bust my ass?
- Yeah, Koo-mar.

53:41.302 --> 53:43.827
Bust your ass.

53:43.905 --> 53:46.567
What kind of name
is that anyhow? Koo-mar.

53:46.641 --> 53:49.235
What is that,
like, five O's or two U's?

53:49.310 --> 53:50.937
No, it's actually one U.

53:51.012 --> 53:52.502
Yeah, bullshit.

53:52.580 --> 53:56.016
Whatever happened to good old
American names like Dave or Jim?

53:56.084 --> 53:57.711
- Harold.
- Harold.

53:57.785 --> 53:59.446
- Are you kidd...
- Now that's a great name.

53:59.520 --> 54:01.078
- Let me take care of this.
- You should be proud of that name, son.

54:01.155 --> 54:02.850
As you were, ladies.

54:03.925 --> 54:07.053
- $220?! Are you crazy?!
- Kumar, if you don't stop...

54:07.128 --> 54:09.460
No, I understand exactly
what's going on here.

54:09.530 --> 54:12.328
Excuse me, officer, let me
take a couple of guesses.

54:12.400 --> 54:14.368
- I'm really sorry...
- Get your hands down!

54:14.435 --> 54:16.665
- Okay, alright.
- No sudden moves. Back it up!

54:16.738 --> 54:19.036
You were probably the big asshole
in your high school, right?

54:19.107 --> 54:20.267
Absolutely right.

54:20.341 --> 54:21.899
Used to pick on guys like us
every day, right?

54:21.976 --> 54:23.034
With pleasure.

54:23.111 --> 54:25.341
Then graduation day came,
and we went to college,

54:25.413 --> 54:27.074
and you went nowhere,
and you thought,

54:27.148 --> 54:28.877
"Hey, how can I
still give them shit?

54:28.950 --> 54:30.577
I know, I'll become a cop."

54:30.651 --> 54:33.552
Well, congratu-fuckin'-lations.
Your dream has come true.

54:33.621 --> 54:35.748
Now, why don't you just take
this quiet little Asian guy

54:35.823 --> 54:37.950
with the Anglicized name
that treats you so well

54:38.025 --> 54:39.424
and give him a couple
of other tickets?

54:39.494 --> 54:41.257
- Better yet, just take him to jail.
- Better idea.

54:41.329 --> 54:43.297
Why don't you just arrest him?
Does that work out for you okay, Harold?

54:43.364 --> 54:44.592
- "Great American name, Harold."
- Let's go, Harold.

54:44.665 --> 54:46.599
Thanks to your buddy,
we're going downtow...

54:52.039 --> 54:53.370
Oh, shit.

54:54.442 --> 54:59.072
Well, thank you so much for
being understanding about Bradley.

54:59.147 --> 55:01.741
I promise you
he won't ever do it again.

55:01.816 --> 55:03.477
I'm sure he won't.

55:04.218 --> 55:05.947
Right, Brad?

55:06.020 --> 55:07.920
Yes, sir,
Officer Palumbo, sir.

55:07.989 --> 55:12.050
- Mommy, can we go home?
- Get in the car, Bradley Thomas.

55:12.126 --> 55:13.150
Bye, Brad.

55:13.227 --> 55:15.252
Are you gonna do
something about my car?

55:15.930 --> 55:17.295
<i>First our top story.</i>

55:17.365 --> 55:20.391
<i>The search for the escaped cheetah
continues tonight.</i>

55:20.468 --> 55:23.460
<i>It was last spotted
in Randolph County. South of...</i>

55:24.605 --> 55:27.836
- So what are you in here for?
- For being black.

55:28.543 --> 55:29.532
Seriously.

55:30.178 --> 55:32.703
I am serious.
You wanna know what happened?

55:34.048 --> 55:36.539
I was walking
out of a Barnes & Noble,

55:36.617 --> 55:38.016
and a cop stops me.

55:38.085 --> 55:41.452
Evidently a black guy
robbed a store in Newark.

55:41.522 --> 55:45.117
I told him, "I haven't even been
to Newark in months."

55:45.193 --> 55:46.888
So, he starts beating me
with his gun...

55:46.961 --> 55:49.259
...telling me to stop resisting arrest.
- Holy shit! What'd you do?

55:49.330 --> 55:51.594
I kept saying,
"I understand I'm under arrest.

55:51.666 --> 55:53.759
Now please stop beating me."

55:53.835 --> 55:56.201
I don't understand how
you can be so calm about all this.

55:56.270 --> 56:00.297
Look at me.
I'm fat, black, can't dance,

56:00.374 --> 56:02.001
and I have two gay fathers.

56:02.910 --> 56:05.743
People have been
messing with me my whole life.

56:05.813 --> 56:09.579
I learned a long time ago that
there's no sense getting all riled up

56:09.650 --> 56:12.050
every time a bunch of idiots
give you a hard time.

56:12.787 --> 56:16.985
In the end, the universe tends
to unfold as it should.

56:18.459 --> 56:20.859
Plus I have a really large penis.
That keeps me happy.

56:22.063 --> 56:23.155
Hey, hey, listen up, guys!

56:23.231 --> 56:24.698
Multiple gunshots
fired in Millbrook Park.

56:24.765 --> 56:26.960
Finally, some action.
I'm goin'!

56:27.034 --> 56:29.093
- No, I'm goin'!
- Lock and load!

56:37.245 --> 56:38.234
That was strange.

56:41.582 --> 56:43.743
What the hell was that?

56:43.818 --> 56:46.013
Rold. Is that you?

56:46.087 --> 56:48.214
- Kumar?
- Are the cops still here?

56:48.289 --> 56:49.620
What the hell are you doing?

56:49.690 --> 56:52.215
I just called and made up some story
about a shooting in Millbrook Park.

56:52.293 --> 56:54.386
- Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for?
- I'm fucking starving.

56:54.462 --> 56:57.158
I figured I'd bust you out
and we'd go get some burgers.

56:57.231 --> 56:59.597
Forget it. I'm not getting
into any more trouble.

56:59.667 --> 57:01.328
I'm already in here because of you.

57:01.402 --> 57:02.391
Hey, fuck you!

57:02.470 --> 57:04.768
What did you want me to do,
stand there and take the hit?

57:04.839 --> 57:06.363
You know I've never
taken a swing at you, ever.

57:06.440 --> 57:07.702
Well, I never got your car stolen.

57:07.775 --> 57:09.072
- Fine. I'm leaving.
- Fine.

57:12.847 --> 57:16.715
- Harold, how do I get out of here?
- How the hell should I know?

57:16.784 --> 57:18.877
Shit! Oh, God, this isn't good.

57:25.826 --> 57:27.521
My ass!

57:31.065 --> 57:33.431
Sure you don't want
to get out of here?

57:33.501 --> 57:35.435
And become a fugitive?
Are you nuts?

57:35.503 --> 57:37.835
- The guy has all my information.
- So what?

57:37.905 --> 57:39.805
We'll just take what he
wrote down about you and leave.

57:39.874 --> 57:41.307
Unless you want to
stay here all night

57:41.375 --> 57:43.366
and not be able to
turn in your work tomorrow.

57:47.848 --> 57:49.042
Fine, hurry up.

57:49.116 --> 57:52.017
Yes! All right,
we gotta find keys.

57:52.086 --> 57:54.384
Oh, yes!

57:54.455 --> 57:56.616
Sweet! I was hoping it would
be one of these big ring of keys.

57:56.691 --> 57:59.125
- Kumar, hurry the fuck up.
- All right, yeah.

58:05.633 --> 58:06.930
- Yes!
- Dude!

58:09.170 --> 58:11.798
- Hey, what's that smell?
- What smell?

58:12.773 --> 58:14.104
Kumar.

58:27.922 --> 58:31.983
<i>If we still have time.
We might still get by</i>

58:32.059 --> 58:35.756
<i>Every time I think about it
I wanna cry</i>

58:35.830 --> 58:39.527
<i>With bombs and the devil.
And the kids keep comin'</i>

58:39.600 --> 58:44.333
<i>No way to breathe easy.
No time to be young</i>

58:46.240 --> 58:50.472
<i>But I tell myself
that I'm doin' all right</i>

58:50.544 --> 58:53.604
<i>There's nothin' left
to do at night</i>

58:53.681 --> 58:56.616
<i>But go crazy on you</i>

58:57.952 --> 59:00.887
<i>Crazy on you</i>

59:00.955 --> 59:05.153
<i>Let me go crazy.
Crazy on you</i>

59:06.627 --> 59:09.653
<i>Crazy on you</i>

59:09.730 --> 59:13.666
Bitch! Learn how to fuckin'
make coffee, you fuckin' whore!

59:13.734 --> 59:15.998
<i>Let me go crazy.
Crazy on you</i>

59:16.070 --> 59:17.628
I love you.

59:18.172 --> 59:19.867
No, no, no.

59:20.675 --> 59:22.609
No, baby, come on.

59:23.844 --> 59:26.836
Hey, Kumar. Kumar!
Where are you...

59:26.914 --> 59:29.041
Kumar!
Still in jail, asshole!

59:29.116 --> 59:30.413
Come here!

59:34.188 --> 59:35.212
Kumar! The cops...

59:35.289 --> 59:37.223
You thought you'd
get away with it, huh?

59:37.291 --> 59:40.021
I was in bed.
I didn't fire any gun. I swear.

59:41.262 --> 59:43.560
Hey, Jackson's trying to escape!

59:43.631 --> 59:45.690
What are you talking about?
I'm just sitting here.

59:45.766 --> 59:46.892
He's trying to break free!
Get him!

59:46.967 --> 59:49.401
- Aw, shit.
- Don't move!

59:51.305 --> 59:53.569
Stop resisting!
We need backup now!

59:53.641 --> 59:55.506
- He's got a gun.
- That's not a gun, that's a book.

59:55.576 --> 59:57.510
- Secure the book!
- Book is secure.

59:57.578 --> 01:00:01.309
You bring this filth in here?
What is this shit?

01:00:01.382 --> 01:00:03.907
Wait, wait. We gotta
do something about this.

01:00:03.984 --> 01:00:06.384
We're gonna teach you
how to read now, brother.

01:00:07.021 --> 01:00:09.421
If I were you, I'd leave
as soon as possible.

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:11.048
- Whose hand is that?
- Thanks, man.

01:00:21.502 --> 01:00:24.369
Jesus Christ.
Thanks for getting me out, man.

01:00:24.438 --> 01:00:28.534
No problem. The burgers wouldn't
taste as good if you weren't there.

01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:29.974
Hey, look at this.

01:00:30.044 --> 01:00:33.810
It's like we went from being
completely poor to being millionaires.

01:00:35.616 --> 01:00:37.914
- What was that?
- Probably just a coyote.

01:00:37.985 --> 01:00:39.885
Aren't people supposed to
be scared of coyotes?

01:00:39.954 --> 01:00:41.444
That's just
'cause they sound scary, man.

01:00:41.522 --> 01:00:44.650
In one-on-one combat, either of us
could take down a coyote, no problem.

01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:45.885
What?

01:00:49.263 --> 01:00:50.992
Now, cheetahs are another story.

01:00:53.701 --> 01:00:55.669
- We're gonna die.
- No, now hold on.

01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:57.203
Cheetahs are used to
eating gazelles and shit.

01:00:57.271 --> 01:00:58.465
They're not known
for eating humans.

01:01:00.074 --> 01:01:02.440
That is a corpse.
We're gonna die.

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:03.841
Shit!
That's not a good sign.

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:07.005
Maybe if we just stay really,
really still, he'll just go away.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:08.241
Okay.

01:01:09.183 --> 01:01:11.014
Just stay really still.
Don't move, okay?

01:01:11.085 --> 01:01:13.178
Just stay right there.
Very good. Good job.

01:01:13.254 --> 01:01:14.949
This isn't working.

01:01:18.993 --> 01:01:22.019
He's mauling me!
He's mauling me!

01:01:26.033 --> 01:01:28.866
Dude, I told you not
to bring the beef jerky.

01:01:39.346 --> 01:01:40.938
He likes me.

01:01:43.551 --> 01:01:45.781
Hey, Rold, I have an idea.

01:01:47.655 --> 01:01:51.091
- You gotta be kidding me, man.
- Uh-uh.

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.223
This is either a really smart move

01:01:58.299 --> 01:02:00.995
or by far the stupidest thing
that we have ever tried.

01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:03.298
Well, we're about to find out.

01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:05.394
Mush!

01:02:07.141 --> 01:02:08.768
I told you this was...

01:02:18.085 --> 01:02:19.074
<i>Oy vey!</i>

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:25.889
Dude, am I really high,
or is this actually working?

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.451
- Both!
- This is awesome!

01:02:28.529 --> 01:02:30.622
We're gonna be
at White Castle in no time!

01:02:31.332 --> 01:02:32.731
That was close, huh, Roldy?

01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:41.172
Harold.
I need you, Harold.

01:02:49.416 --> 01:02:51.611
I need you, Harold.

01:02:52.152 --> 01:02:53.744
Come here.

01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:56.187
- Come here, Harold.
- Maria.

01:02:56.257 --> 01:02:58.725
- Come, Harold.
- I'm coming, baby!

01:02:59.627 --> 01:03:02.152
<i>I want you to hold me.
Papi. I need you.</i>

01:03:02.229 --> 01:03:05.062
Baby, I'm a-comin'!

01:03:05.566 --> 01:03:06.555
Not so fast.

01:03:06.634 --> 01:03:08.295
<i>Watch out, watch out</i>

01:03:10.004 --> 01:03:11.369
Come on!

01:03:14.141 --> 01:03:19.443
Bullets... my only weakness.
How did you know?

01:03:19.513 --> 01:03:20.502
<i>Maria</i>

01:03:20.581 --> 01:03:22.071
Harold.

01:03:22.149 --> 01:03:23.480
Maria.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:26.314
<i>Maria</i>

01:03:32.259 --> 01:03:34.056
<i>Maria. Maria</i>

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.097
<i>Watch out, watch out</i>

01:03:43.671 --> 01:03:45.605
<i>Watch out, watch out</i>

01:03:48.842 --> 01:03:51.811
What the hell
are you doing? God!

01:03:51.879 --> 01:03:53.744
You've been out cold
for the past half-hour.

01:03:53.814 --> 01:03:56.009
I figured maybe if I did
some gay shit you'd wake up.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:58.347
If we did some gay shit?
Where are we?

01:03:58.419 --> 01:04:01.320
Didn't we come here on a cheetah?
Where's the cheetah?

01:04:01.388 --> 01:04:03.618
It ran away. Listen, forget
about the cheetah, okay?

01:04:03.691 --> 01:04:05.921
I have some bad news
and some worse news.

01:04:05.993 --> 01:04:07.824
Give me the worse news first.

01:04:07.895 --> 01:04:09.328
I looked at some
of the road signs up there,

01:04:09.396 --> 01:04:11.626
and it looks like the cheetah
took us in the wrong direction.

01:04:11.699 --> 01:04:13.826
- Shit!
- Yeah.

01:04:14.001 --> 01:04:15.525
- Shit!
- Yeah.

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:18.195
All right, what's the bad news?

01:04:18.272 --> 01:04:20.172
Your laptop's completely destroyed.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.639
What?

01:04:21.709 --> 01:04:25.042
Why didn't...
Why didn't you tell me...

01:04:25.112 --> 01:04:27.842
How is that not
the worse news?

01:04:27.915 --> 01:04:29.883
The laptop situation
really only affects you,

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:33.886
whereas the White Castle
situation affects both of us equally.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.648
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:04:38.726 --> 01:04:41.524
All my work was saved
on this computer.

01:04:41.595 --> 01:04:43.563
Now I gotta go back
to the office and redo it.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:44.654
Exactly.
First we'll go to White Castle...

01:04:44.732 --> 01:04:46.757
Forget about White Castle.
There is no time.

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:48.961
Car.

01:04:55.209 --> 01:04:57.109
Hello. Over here!

01:04:59.847 --> 01:05:01.337
Shit.

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:24.737
Whoa.

01:05:26.373 --> 01:05:27.465
Yeah. Um...

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.973
All right,
we'll get a pay phone,

01:05:31.045 --> 01:05:33.343
get a cab back
to your office, all right?

01:05:34.581 --> 01:05:36.208
Come on. You all right?

01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:48.051
- Hey, check this out!
- Yeah, nice!

01:05:50.764 --> 01:05:52.197
Hey, Apu!

01:05:52.266 --> 01:05:54.734
Jesus. These guys
are frickin' everywhere.

01:05:54.802 --> 01:05:57.669
Who's looking after
the Kwik-E-Mart while you're gone?

01:05:57.738 --> 01:06:00.036
You two going
to share a curry Slurpee?

01:06:00.107 --> 01:06:01.597
Fucking assholes.

01:06:02.276 --> 01:06:04.540
Dude, check it out.
It's Rosenberg and Goldstein.

01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:10.811
I want that.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:12.749
What, a Hot Dog Heaven
super chili cheese dog?

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.584
No. I want that feeling.

01:06:15.656 --> 01:06:18.022
The feeling that comes over a man

01:06:18.092 --> 01:06:20.185
when he gets
exactly what he desires.

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.194
I need that feeling.

01:06:22.262 --> 01:06:23.820
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:26.161
- We gotta go to White Castle.
- Yes, yes!

01:06:26.233 --> 01:06:27.860
I knew you had it in you, dude.

01:06:29.002 --> 01:06:30.401
Yo, is that Cindy Kim?

01:06:34.174 --> 01:06:37.507
Oh, dude, you should've boned her
when you had the chance, man.

01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:39.409
Check it out.

01:06:43.283 --> 01:06:44.944
Why don't you guys
just leave us alone?

01:06:45.018 --> 01:06:46.849
What are you gonna
do about it, Mr. Miyagi?

01:06:50.124 --> 01:06:51.557
That's extreme, man!

01:06:52.392 --> 01:06:54.485
<i>There's no sense
getting all riled up</i>

01:06:54.561 --> 01:06:57.325
<i>every time a bunch of idiots
give you a hard time.</i>

01:06:57.397 --> 01:07:01.197
<i>The universe tends
to unfold as it should.</i>

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:03.758
Nothing.

01:07:05.672 --> 01:07:07.867
- Fucking extreme!
- I'm so sick of their bullshit.

01:07:09.476 --> 01:07:13.037
Don't worry. The universe
tends to unfold as it should.

01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:15.809
What is that,
some fortune cookie?

01:07:17.384 --> 01:07:21.081
Hey, I got a plan.
Follow my lead, okay?

01:07:21.155 --> 01:07:22.884
- Your lead?
- Yeah.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.389
Okay.

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:27.586
Whoa, what are you doing?
Oh, shit!

01:07:31.999 --> 01:07:32.988
Those pricks!

01:07:33.066 --> 01:07:35.261
- This is your plan?
- It's working, isn't it?

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:39.632
Come on, come on!
Get 'em, guys!

01:07:39.706 --> 01:07:41.537
- Jerk-offs!
- My truck!

01:07:44.211 --> 01:07:46.270
Thank you, come again.

01:07:51.552 --> 01:07:54.521
Dude, that was so not extreme.

01:07:54.588 --> 01:07:57.022
I know, Extreme Sport Punk
Number One.

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:02.124
I know.

01:08:02.196 --> 01:08:03.754
Let's find us some tunes, baby.

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:07.231
"Cole's Extreme Mix, Volume 5"?
What is this shit?

01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:11.733
<i>And I need you now tonight</i>

01:08:11.805 --> 01:08:14.399
Those guys are fuckin' posers.

01:08:15.342 --> 01:08:19.540
<i>And if you'll only hold me tight</i>

01:08:19.613 --> 01:08:24.676
<i>Baby. Baby. The stars
are shining foryou</i>

01:08:24.751 --> 01:08:29.245
<i>And just like me.
I'm sure that they adore you</i>

01:08:29.323 --> 01:08:30.551
<i>Baby. Baby</i>

01:08:30.624 --> 01:08:33.593
<i>Go walking through the forest</i>

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:36.220
<i>Things'll go your way</i>

01:08:36.296 --> 01:08:38.526
<i>Hold on for one more day</i>

01:08:38.599 --> 01:08:40.725
<i>I know that there is pain</i>

01:08:40.801 --> 01:08:42.962
<i>But you hold on for one more day</i>

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:47.439
<i>And you break free
from the chains</i>

01:08:48.308 --> 01:08:50.276
<i>Yeah. I know that there is pain</i>

01:08:50.344 --> 01:08:52.904
<i>But you hold on
for one more day</i>

01:08:52.979 --> 01:08:56.108
<i>And you break free
right from the chains</i>

01:08:57.951 --> 01:09:01.113
Someday somebody's gonna
make you wanna turn around

01:09:01.188 --> 01:09:03.281
- And say good-bye
- Say good-bye

01:09:03.357 --> 01:09:04.721
Until then, baby

01:09:04.791 --> 01:09:07.191
Are you gonna let 'em
hold you down and make you cry?

01:09:07.261 --> 01:09:10.287
Don't you know
things can change

01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:11.796
Things'll go your way

01:09:11.865 --> 01:09:16.359
If you hold on for one more day

01:09:16.435 --> 01:09:19.404
Hold on

01:09:23.477 --> 01:09:24.636
Bingo.

01:09:24.978 --> 01:09:28.140
Yeah, dude! Cherry Hill, man.
We're almost there.

01:09:28.215 --> 01:09:29.580
I told you, man!

01:09:29.649 --> 01:09:31.982
I found 'em,
and I'm gonna need backup.

01:09:32.051 --> 01:09:34.247
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

01:09:34.321 --> 01:09:36.983
Fudge, dude.
Are you kidding me?

01:09:37.658 --> 01:09:40.854
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not going back to jail, man.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.794
We've come too far.
Now buckle up. Buckle up!

01:09:45.532 --> 01:09:47.727
We got a chase on our hands.

01:09:49.202 --> 01:09:51.466
- Ready?
- Yeah. For what?

01:09:51.537 --> 01:09:52.800
Oh, shit!

01:09:55.409 --> 01:09:58.105
- Where the fuck you takin' us?
- Just hold on.

01:10:03.417 --> 01:10:04.714
What the...

01:10:08.689 --> 01:10:11.487
It's a good thing I have an empty
stomach or else I'd puke right now.

01:10:16.196 --> 01:10:17.527
We're gonna make it.

01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:20.399
Everything's gonna be all ri...

01:10:22.502 --> 01:10:24.367
Oh, my God!

01:10:25.839 --> 01:10:27.204
Oh, shit. Holy shit.

01:10:27.274 --> 01:10:29.799
- Put her in reverse. Hurry!
- Shit!

01:10:29.876 --> 01:10:31.741
Let's go out the back.
I'll go first.

01:10:31.812 --> 01:10:34.645
- Don't shake the car!
- Well, hurry up!

01:10:42.255 --> 01:10:43.779
Hey, Roldy, check it out.

01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:58.531
Shit, shit!
We're trapped, man!

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:04.871
Whoa. Not necessarily.

01:11:05.846 --> 01:11:07.438
No.

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:09.880
No, not a chance.
I'd rather turn myself in than die.

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:11.315
No, dude, I know
exactly how to do that.

01:11:11.385 --> 01:11:13.410
I used to do it with my dad
all the time when I was a kid.

01:11:13.487 --> 01:11:16.354
Forget it! I'm not risking my life
over a bunch of hamburgers, man.

01:11:16.423 --> 01:11:18.687
So you think this is
just about the burgers, huh?

01:11:19.593 --> 01:11:23.085
Let me tell you,
it's about far more than that.

01:11:24.931 --> 01:11:26.899
Our parents came to this country,

01:11:26.967 --> 01:11:30.994
escaping persecution,
poverty, and hunger.

01:11:31.838 --> 01:11:33.703
Hunger, Harold.

01:11:33.774 --> 01:11:36.675
They were very, very hungry.

01:11:37.778 --> 01:11:40.474
They wanted to live in a land
that treated them as equals,

01:11:40.547 --> 01:11:42.606
a land filled with hamburger stands.

01:11:42.682 --> 01:11:44.707
And not just
one type of hamburger, okay?

01:11:44.785 --> 01:11:48.380
Hundreds of types with different
sizes, toppings, and condiments.

01:11:50.357 --> 01:11:52.325
That land was America.

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:56.258
America, Harold! America!

01:11:57.431 --> 01:12:01.094
Now, this is about achieving
what our parents set out for.

01:12:01.168 --> 01:12:04.331
This is about the pursuit
of happiness.

01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:08.340
This night...
is about the American dream.

01:12:15.749 --> 01:12:17.842
Dude, we can stay here,
get arrested,

01:12:17.918 --> 01:12:20.887
and end our hopes of ever
going to White Castle.

01:12:20.954 --> 01:12:24.788
Or we can take that hang glider
and make our leap towards freedom.

01:12:24.858 --> 01:12:27.190
I leave the decision up to you.

01:12:29.996 --> 01:12:31.793
I hate you, Kumar.

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:34.995
Tilt forward.

01:12:35.068 --> 01:12:36.057
- Roldy.
- What?

01:12:36.136 --> 01:12:37.899
- Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.
- All right.

01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:43.268
- Good job, Rold. Keep running.
- Thank you.

01:12:43.343 --> 01:12:46.471
Hey, Roldy, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

01:12:46.546 --> 01:12:48.605
- I've never hang-glided before.
- What?!

01:12:48.682 --> 01:12:49.910
Jump!

01:12:58.358 --> 01:12:59.347
Oh, my God!

01:12:59.426 --> 01:13:01.291
- Dude, it's working!
- Oh, my God!

01:13:01.361 --> 01:13:03.329
Yeah!

01:13:03.964 --> 01:13:05.022
Good news.

01:13:05.098 --> 01:13:07.430
I just found enough dope in the car

01:13:07.501 --> 01:13:10.902
to put these skateboard punks
in jail for the next couple of years.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.676
- Dude, we're so high right now.
- We're not low.

01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:27.809
All right, I'm bringing her in.
Right, left, left.

01:13:27.888 --> 01:13:29.321
Perfect!

01:13:29.389 --> 01:13:31.584
- Shit!
- Shit!

01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:44.928
God!

01:13:45.005 --> 01:13:46.370
I'm gonna kill you!

01:13:47.874 --> 01:13:49.307
Look!

01:13:59.753 --> 01:14:01.186
We made it, dude.

01:14:19.172 --> 01:14:21.106
Looks like you guys
had some night, huh?

01:14:21.174 --> 01:14:24.439
I want 30 Slyders, 5 French fries,
and 4 large Cherry Cokes.

01:14:24.511 --> 01:14:28.447
I want the same, except
make mine Diet Cokes, Chuck.

01:14:28.515 --> 01:14:32.417
Wow. Well, that comes
to $46.75.

01:14:34.654 --> 01:14:37.646
- Dude, where's my money?
- You don't have money?

01:14:37.724 --> 01:14:39.021
- Dude, are you kidding me?
- No.

01:14:39.092 --> 01:14:41.117
I gave mine
to that asshole at Princeton.

01:14:41.194 --> 01:14:44.322
Fuck! Fuck that hippie fuck!
No! Dude, this isn't happening!

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.058
We didn't make it here,
and now we're broke!

01:14:46.132 --> 01:14:47.394
No, no, no, no!

01:14:47.467 --> 01:14:50.698
Guys, let me pay for it.
It's the least I can do.

01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:52.135
The hell are you doing here?

01:14:52.205 --> 01:14:54.435
You guys kept talking about
White Castle last night so much,

01:14:54.507 --> 01:14:55.804
it made me start to crave it, too.

01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:58.241
- Dude, where's my car?
- Where's his car, dude?

01:14:58.311 --> 01:15:01.803
Yeah, sorry about that.
I told you last night I was tripping balls.

01:15:01.881 --> 01:15:03.405
I don't know what came over me.

01:15:03.483 --> 01:15:05.883
Your car's in the parking lot.
Here are your keys.

01:15:05.952 --> 01:15:08.420
Do you realize what the hell we had to
go through after you took the car?

01:15:08.488 --> 01:15:11.286
Yeah. It was a dick move
on my part.

01:15:11.358 --> 01:15:14.919
That's why I'm paying
for your meal. Prick.

01:15:14.995 --> 01:15:16.394
Thanks, I guess.

01:15:16.463 --> 01:15:21.526
Here's 50 bucks for the burgers
and 200 for the car.

01:15:22.702 --> 01:15:23.999
What happened to my car?

01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:27.267
I made some love stains
in the back seat.

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.069
You'll see.

01:15:31.778 --> 01:15:33.905
Anyway, nice meeting you guys.
I'll catch you later.

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:35.709
Where are you going?

01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:38.879
Wherever God takes me.

01:15:56.503 --> 01:15:58.368
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:58.438 --> 01:15:59.462
Let's do this together.

01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:38.302
Damn, that hit the spot.

01:16:38.378 --> 01:16:41.347
- That was the best meal of my life.
- Mine, too.

01:16:41.414 --> 01:16:42.972
You know what, dude?

01:16:43.049 --> 01:16:45.347
I think I may actually go
to my interview today.

01:16:45.418 --> 01:16:46.510
Are you serious?

01:16:46.586 --> 01:16:48.076
You know, my whole life
I've just been scared

01:16:48.154 --> 01:16:50.281
of being one of those nerdy
Indian guys turned doctor,

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:51.914
but tonight got me thinking.

01:16:51.991 --> 01:16:54.221
There are far worse things
in this world than being tapped

01:16:54.294 --> 01:16:56.455
for having a natural
ability in medicine.

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:59.157
<i>Chick magnet. Chick magnet</i>

01:16:59.232 --> 01:17:02.258
Plus, how cool was that,
saving that dude's life last night?

01:17:02.335 --> 01:17:06.237
It was somewhere between that,
getting yelled at by my dad,

01:17:06.306 --> 01:17:07.295
and seeing Neil Patrick Harris

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:08.840
that I realized that I've
always wanted to be a doctor

01:17:08.908 --> 01:17:10.933
but I've just been too scared
to admit it to myself.

01:17:11.010 --> 01:17:13.308
- Billy, you paying for this?
- Yeah, I'll be there...

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.937
Good, 'cause if he wasn't,
you would.

01:17:15.014 --> 01:17:17.847
Are you listening to me, Roldy?
I'm having a major epiphany here.

01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:19.578
I'll be right back.

01:17:19.652 --> 01:17:21.381
You're unlike any other woman
I've ever met.

01:17:21.454 --> 01:17:23.945
What the fuck is going on here?

01:17:24.824 --> 01:17:27.793
Harold?
What happened to you, man?

01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:30.022
<i>Never mind me.
What the fuck are you doing here?</i>

01:17:30.096 --> 01:17:32.257
I thought you and J.D.
Were busy all night with clients.

01:17:32.332 --> 01:17:33.697
Isn't that why
I had to do your work?

01:17:33.767 --> 01:17:35.997
- Henry, what the hell's going on?
- Back off, cock boy.

01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:37.866
What I said to him
goes double for you.

01:17:37.937 --> 01:17:39.837
- Did you just call me cock boy?
- Yeah, you know I did.

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:40.895
You're just stalling

01:17:40.974 --> 01:17:42.908
because you're not quick
enough to think of a comeback.

01:17:42.976 --> 01:17:44.910
You think I'm not quick enough.
Guy thinks I'm not quick enough.

01:17:44.978 --> 01:17:47.742
<i>Well, I've got news for you.
I am quick enough...</i>

01:17:51.151 --> 01:17:52.516
...cock boy!

01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:56.479
Listen, Harold, I'm really sorry.

01:17:56.556 --> 01:17:58.922
Don't bother with him. We'll take it up
with Berenson tomorrow.

01:17:58.992 --> 01:18:00.755
What are you
gonna tell Berenson?

01:18:00.827 --> 01:18:02.886
That I'm your workhorse?

01:18:02.962 --> 01:18:05.692
That you guys think
you can party all weekend,

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:07.824
leave the work to
the quiet Asian guy in the office?

01:18:07.901 --> 01:18:11.132
<i>- No, you don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.</i>

01:18:11.204 --> 01:18:14.537
I'm not doing
your work for you anymore.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:16.802
And if either one
of you douche bags

01:18:16.876 --> 01:18:18.901
ever tries to pull
this shit again,

01:18:18.978 --> 01:18:20.411
I'll go to Berenson myself.

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.448
I'll tell him what's really going on.

01:18:22.515 --> 01:18:24.176
And I'll tell the whole office

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:27.708
how you both caught gonorrhea
from that prostitute in Atlantic City.

01:18:28.988 --> 01:18:31.650
If you'll excuse me, boys,
I gotta get going. Kumar.

01:18:33.193 --> 01:18:35.423
See you boys
at the office on Monday.

01:18:35.495 --> 01:18:36.826
Excuse me.

01:18:43.703 --> 01:18:46.672
Dude, that was awesome!
Where the hell did that come from?

01:18:46.739 --> 01:18:47.728
I don't know.

01:18:47.807 --> 01:18:50.833
Eating those delicious burgers
made me feel like a new man.

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:51.934
You know what?

01:18:52.011 --> 01:18:53.808
Now I'm actually looking forward
to going to work this week.

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:57.338
No shit. You know,
you might be worthwhile after all.

01:18:57.417 --> 01:18:58.884
I'm not worthless.

01:18:58.952 --> 01:19:02.319
Hey, so those dudes
really have gonorrhea?

01:19:02.388 --> 01:19:03.650
Beats me.

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:06.989
Hey.

01:19:07.894 --> 01:19:09.953
- Let's get going.
- What's the rush, dude?

01:19:10.029 --> 01:19:11.690
I don't have my interview
for a couple of hours.

01:19:11.764 --> 01:19:14.028
I got some unfinished business
to take care of.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.897
I thought those guys
were gonna do the work.

01:19:15.969 --> 01:19:18.403
No, unfinished business.

01:19:18.471 --> 01:19:20.666
- Maria.
- Still not following you.

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:21.729
Get in!

01:19:28.381 --> 01:19:29.814
So you don't even have a plan.

01:19:29.883 --> 01:19:33.011
Dude, I got love
on my side, man.

01:19:33.086 --> 01:19:34.246
Trust me.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.279
When I see Maria, I'm gonna
know exactly what to say.

01:19:43.329 --> 01:19:44.762
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:44.831 --> 01:19:47.698
It looks like you guys
have had some night.

01:19:51.671 --> 01:19:55.300
Shit. You know what?
I left my lighter in your car.

01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:57.240
Do me a favor and run down
and get it for me, please?

01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:58.971
I gotta urinate.

01:20:19.532 --> 01:20:21.932
You sure got a lot of baggage.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.113
Maria, wait.

01:20:35.181 --> 01:20:37.308
I know this is gonna seem
completely out of the blue,

01:20:37.383 --> 01:20:40.443
and I know you don't know me
very well... or, um, at all.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.385
But let me tell you
the best part of my day is.

01:20:42.455 --> 01:20:44.946
I come home from work
and I walk through this lobby,

01:20:45.024 --> 01:20:47.083
and on days that I'm lucky enough,

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.425
I spend ten seconds
in this elevator with you.

01:20:50.496 --> 01:20:52.589
I had the craziest night
of my life tonight,

01:20:52.665 --> 01:20:55.828
and I guess I learned that
if you want something or someone,

01:20:55.902 --> 01:20:57.130
you have to go for it.

01:20:59.305 --> 01:21:01.705
And if Liane can
marry a guy like Freakshow

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:04.504
and I can hang-glide
and I can ride a cheetah,

01:21:04.577 --> 01:21:06.135
then I guess...

01:21:07.146 --> 01:21:08.135
Oh, fuck it.

01:21:08.214 --> 01:21:12.207
Girl, I'm spendin' my dimes

01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:14.617
Give me a minute.
This is crazy.

01:21:14.687 --> 01:21:16.746
- That was... l'm sorry.
- I don't even know you.

01:21:16.823 --> 01:21:19.314
I had White Castle,
so I'm a little dizzy.

01:21:19.392 --> 01:21:22.020
- We don't ever speak.
- We don't talk, so that was inappropriate.

01:21:22.095 --> 01:21:23.357
Oh, fuck it.

01:21:23.429 --> 01:21:26.227
<i>I wanna get next to you</i>

01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:34.003
<i>I wanna get next to you</i>

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.999
Okay.

01:21:39.746 --> 01:21:41.714
Now you just have to work
on your timing.

01:21:41.781 --> 01:21:43.715
- Where are you going?
- Amsterdam.

01:21:43.783 --> 01:21:46.946
I'll be back in ten days.
But I'll see you when I get back?

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.215
Yeah, let's do that.

01:21:55.862 --> 01:21:57.352
Bye, Harold.

01:21:59.899 --> 01:22:01.764
Bye. Bye.
I'll see you later.

01:22:03.102 --> 01:22:05.036
- She touch your penis?
- What?

01:22:05.104 --> 01:22:06.731
What happened?

01:22:06.806 --> 01:22:11.243
Nothing much, really.
Just a little kiss action.

01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:12.937
Nice. Nice!

01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:15.572
Yeah. She's going to Amsterdam.
She'll be back in ten days.

01:22:15.648 --> 01:22:17.479
We gotta go.

01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:19.108
- Where?
- Amsterdam, man.

01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:20.584
- We gotta get our bags packed...
- Amsterdam?

01:22:20.653 --> 01:22:22.678
...and frickin' take the next flight out.

01:22:22.755 --> 01:22:24.848
Are you freaking out of your mind?
What about your interview?

01:22:24.924 --> 01:22:26.915
Dude, whatever.
I'll tell my dad to reschedule it.

01:22:26.993 --> 01:22:29.826
He won't have a problem as long as
I take it seriously for a change.

01:22:29.896 --> 01:22:32.763
We gotta freakin' go to Europe
and find Maria.

01:22:32.832 --> 01:22:34.891
Dude, she's coming back
in ten days.

01:22:34.967 --> 01:22:36.628
It's not like I'm never
gonna see her again.

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:37.930
Listen, for a hot chick,

01:22:38.004 --> 01:22:39.972
ten days in Europe
can be the kiss of death, okay?

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:43.133
She's gonna have all these suave,
sophisticated guys all over her.

01:22:43.209 --> 01:22:45.177
When she gets back,
she may not be available.

01:22:45.244 --> 01:22:47.712
Forget it. I'll see her
when she comes back.

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.974
Hey, Roldy.

01:22:50.516 --> 01:22:53.576
You do realize what's legal
in Amsterdam, don't you?

01:22:56.155 --> 01:22:57.349
Oh, yeah.

01:23:04.497 --> 01:23:07.261
In today's headlines,
Rutgers professor Tarik Jackson

01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:10.166
and attorney Nathaniel Banks are
suing the state of New Jersey

01:23:10.236 --> 01:23:12.761
for racial discrimination
and police brutality.

01:23:12.839 --> 01:23:15.273
My family and I are outraged

01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:17.775
