02:45.265 --> 02:49.964
I'm gonna turn over the next card.
I want you to concentrate.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.969
I want you to teII me
what you think it is.

02:58.478 --> 02:59.843
Square.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.208
Good guess. But wrong.

03:11.791 --> 03:13.520
CIear your head.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.894
AII right. TeII me what you think it is.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.858
Is it a star?

03:22.936 --> 03:26.702
It is a star. Very good. That's great.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.603
Okay. AII right.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.812
Think hard. What is it?

03:34.581 --> 03:36.481
CircIe.

03:36.649 --> 03:40.551
CIose. But definiteIy wrong.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.349
Okay.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.258
-AII right. Ready?
-Yeah.

03:48.428 --> 03:49.793
AII right.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.125
What is it?

03:55.535 --> 03:56.866
Come on.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.968
Figure eight.

04:02.442 --> 04:06.242
IncredibIe. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?

04:06.412 --> 04:10.371
-You're not cheating me, are you?
-No, I swear they're just coming to me.

04:11.217 --> 04:12.650
Okay.

04:13.686 --> 04:18.281
-Nervous?
-Yes. I don't Iike this.

04:18.458 --> 04:23.725
You onIy have 75 more to go, okay?
What's this one?

04:27.233 --> 04:29.224
It's a coupIe of wavy Iines.

04:29.402 --> 04:33.168
-Sorry. This isn't your Iucky day.
-I know.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.773
Wait--

04:41.547 --> 04:43.276
I'm getting a IittIe tired of this!

04:43.449 --> 04:45.849
You voIunteered, didn't you?
We're paying, aren't we?

04:46.019 --> 04:49.318
Yeah, but I didn't know you were
gonna give me eIectric shocks!

04:49.489 --> 04:51.514
What are you trying
to prove here, anyway?

04:51.691 --> 04:55.650
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP abiIity.

04:55.828 --> 04:59.286
The effect? I'II teII you what
the effect is. It's pissing me off!

04:59.465 --> 05:01.296
WeII, then maybe my theory is correct!

05:01.467 --> 05:05.267
-You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
-I wiII, mister!

05:09.242 --> 05:11.938
You may as weII get used to that.

05:12.178 --> 05:16.842
It's the kind of resentment that your
abiIity wiII provoke in some peopIe.

05:17.183 --> 05:20.277
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?

05:21.621 --> 05:24.089
You're no fIuke, Jennifer.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.919
This is it. This is definiteIy it!

05:27.093 --> 05:29.220
Did those UV Ienses come in
for the video camera?

05:29.395 --> 05:32.956
And that bIank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

05:33.132 --> 05:36.226
-WiII you excuse me for a second?
-Sure.

05:37.570 --> 05:40.937
I'm right in the middIe
of something, Ray.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.734
I need more time with this subject.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.400
CouId you come back in an hour,
hour and a haIf?

05:45.578 --> 05:47.569
Peter, at 1 :40 p.m...

05:47.747 --> 05:51.183
...at the main branch of The New York
PubIic Library on Fifth Avenue...

05:51.351 --> 05:56.152
...1 0 peopIe witnessed a free-fIoating,
fuII-torso, vaporous apparition.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.381
It bIew books off sheIves
from 20 feet away...

05:58.558 --> 06:00.924
...and scared the socks
off some poor Iibrarian.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.324
I'm very excited. I'm very pIeased.

06:03.496 --> 06:07.557
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.396
You're coming with us on this one.
SpengIer went down there.

06:10.570 --> 06:13.596
He took PKE vaIences,
went right off the top of the scaIe.

06:13.773 --> 06:18.107
Buried the needIe.
We're cIose on this one. I can feeI it.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.714
I can feeI it. We're very, very cIose.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.813
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
Iike to work with you some more.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.253
Perhaps you couId come back
this evening, say at--?

06:32.425 --> 06:33.824
Eight o'cIock?

06:33.993 --> 06:38.862
I was just going to say, ''8:00?''
You are a Iegitimate phenomenon.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.162
As a friend, I must say...

06:43.336 --> 06:46.100
...you've finaIIy gone around the bend
on this ghost business.

06:46.272 --> 06:49.605
You guys have been meeting
every schizo in the five boroughs...

06:49.776 --> 06:52.711
...who says he has a paranormaI
experience. What have you seen?

06:53.246 --> 06:58.206
You forget, I was there at an undersea,
unexpIained mass sponge migration.

06:58.384 --> 07:03.253
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a haIf.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.196
-You're here.
-Yeah, what have you got?

07:11.364 --> 07:14.629
This is big, this is very big.
There's definiteIy something here.

07:14.801 --> 07:18.464
Egon, this reminds me of the time you
tried to driII a hoIe through your head.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.697
-Remember that?
-That wouId've worked if--

07:20.873 --> 07:23.774
I'm Roger DeIacorte.
Are you the men from the university?

07:23.943 --> 07:27.538
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.

07:27.713 --> 07:31.672
Thank you for coming. I hope we
can cIear this up quickIy and quietIy.

07:31.851 --> 07:36.220
Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.720
I don't remember seeing any Iegs...

07:38.891 --> 07:42.019
...but it definiteIy had arms,
because it reached out for me.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.322
Arms? I can't wait
to get a Iook at this thing.

07:44.497 --> 07:47.295
AIice, I'II ask you a coupIe
of standard questions, okay?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.791
Have you or any member
of your famiIy...

07:49.969 --> 07:54.065
...ever been diagnosed schizophrenic,
mentaIIy incompetent?

07:54.874 --> 07:57.968
My uncIe thought he was St. Jerome.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.943
I'd caII that a big yes.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.418
Are you habituaIIy using drugs,
stimuIants, aIcohoI?

08:06.586 --> 08:09.851
-No.
-No, no. Just asking.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.522
Are you, AIice,
menstruating right now?

08:13.693 --> 08:18.858
-What has that got to do with it?
-Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

08:19.131 --> 08:22.157
Ray, it's moving. Come on.

08:47.226 --> 08:48.659
Look!

08:54.300 --> 08:58.100
-This is hot, Ray.
-SymmetricaI book-stacking.

08:58.271 --> 09:02.207
Just Iike the PhiIadeIphia
mass turbuIence of 1 94 7.

09:02.508 --> 09:06.604
You're right. No human being
wouId stack books Iike this.

09:07.113 --> 09:10.708
Listen! Do you smeII something?

09:18.524 --> 09:22.290
TaIk about teIekinetic activity.
Look at this mess.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.527
Raymond, Iook at this.

09:26.032 --> 09:28.227
EctopIasmic residue.

09:28.401 --> 09:32.531
-Venkman, get a sampIe of this.
-It's the reaI thing.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.866
Somebody bIows their nose,
and you wanna keep it?

09:35.041 --> 09:36.804
I'd Iike to anaIyze it.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.935
-There's more over here.
-I'm getting stronger readings here.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.782
This way.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.282
Come on.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.500
Egon, your mucus.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.870
This happen to you before?

10:15.781 --> 10:17.373
First time?

10:42.742 --> 10:44.471
It's here.

10:45.378 --> 10:49.610
A fuII torso apparition. And it's reaI.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.287
So, what do we do?

11:01.093 --> 11:04.256
CouId you come over here
and taIk to me for a second, pIease?

11:04.430 --> 11:06.523
CouId you just come here
for a second, pIease?

11:06.699 --> 11:10.157
Right over here.
Come here, Francine. Come here.

11:10.736 --> 11:13.830
-What do we do?
-I don't know. What do you think?

11:14.006 --> 11:15.803
Stop that!

11:16.108 --> 11:19.271
We've gotta make contact.
One of us shouId try to speak to it.

11:19.445 --> 11:20.878
Good idea.

11:29.588 --> 11:31.112
HeIIo.

11:31.657 --> 11:33.318
I'm Peter.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.425
Where are you from? OriginaIIy.

11:42.101 --> 11:45.332
AII right. Okay.
The usuaI stuff isn't working.

11:45.504 --> 11:49.838
Okay, I have a pIan.
I know exactIy what to do.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.904
Now, stay cIose.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.271
Stay cIose.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.450
I know. Do exactIy as I say.

11:59.618 --> 12:01.848
Get ready. Ready?

12:02.021 --> 12:03.511
Get her!

12:12.031 --> 12:15.091
-Did you see it? What was it?
-We'II get back to you.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.666
Wait!

12:25.544 --> 12:30.004
''Get her.'' That was your whoIe pIan.
Get her.

12:31.050 --> 12:35.009
-It was scientific.
-I just got overexcited.

12:35.187 --> 12:39.123
But wasn't it incredibIe, Pete?
We actuaIIy touched the etheric pIane.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.225
You know what this couId mean
to the schooI?

12:41.393 --> 12:43.884
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger
than the microchip.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.792
The experience wasn't
compIeteIy wasted.

12:45.965 --> 12:48.593
According to these readings,
we have an exceIIent chance...

12:48.768 --> 12:50.599
...of catching and hoIding a ghost.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.934
This is great. If the ionization rate is
constant for aII ectopIasmic entities...

12:55.107 --> 12:58.167
...we couId reaIIy bust some heads.
In a spirituaI sense, of course.

12:58.344 --> 13:01.313
Spengs, you serious
about this catching a ghost?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.414
I'm aIways serious.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.612
Egon, I'm gonna take back some
of the things I've said about you.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.250
You've earned it.

13:14.326 --> 13:18.456
The possibiIities are IimitIess.
Hey, Dean Yeager.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.595
I trust you're moving us
to better quarters on campus.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.863
No, you're being moved off campus.

13:27.039 --> 13:29.735
The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.707
You are to vacate
these premises immediateIy.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.847
This is preposterous.
I demand an expIanation.

13:36.015 --> 13:39.041
Fine. This university
wiII no Ionger continue...

13:39.218 --> 13:42.517
...any funding of any kind
for your group's activities.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.349
But the kids Iove us.

13:44.523 --> 13:50.655
Dr. Venkman, we beIieve the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

13:50.830 --> 13:55.392
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustIe.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.968
Your theories are the worst kind
of popuIar tripe.

13:58.137 --> 14:01.231
Your methods are sIoppy, and your
concIusions are highIy questionabIe.

14:01.407 --> 14:05.070
You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.770
I see.

14:07.947 --> 14:12.782
And you have no pIace in this
department or in this university.

14:13.252 --> 14:16.278
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MIT or Stanford now.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.719
They wouIdn't touch us
with a 1 0-meter cattIe prod.

14:18.891 --> 14:21.052
You're aIways so concerned
about your reputation.

14:21.227 --> 14:24.162
Einstein did his best stuff when
he was working as a patent cIerk.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.264
You know how much
a patent cIerk earns?

14:26.432 --> 14:30.300
The university gave us money.
We didn't have to produce anything.

14:30.469 --> 14:33.336
You've never been out of coIIege.
You don't know what it's Iike.

14:33.505 --> 14:36.906
I've worked in the private sector.
They expect resuIts.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.976
For whatever reasons, Ray...

14:39.144 --> 14:44.172
...caII it fate, caII it Iuck,
caII it karma...

14:44.350 --> 14:47.183
...I beIieve that everything
happens for a reason.

14:47.353 --> 14:51.449
I beIieve that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

14:51.624 --> 14:56.584
-For what purpose?
-To go into business for ourseIves.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.160
This ecto-containment system
SpengIer and I have in mind...

15:03.335 --> 15:07.101
...wiII require a Ioad of capitaI.
Where wiII we get the money?

15:08.841 --> 15:12.470
I don't know. I don't know.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.708
You're never gonna regret this, Ray.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.442
My parents Ieft me that house.
I was born there.

15:19.618 --> 15:23.019
You won't Iose the house. Everybody
has three mortgages nowadays.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.713
But at 1 9 percent?
You didn't even bargain with the guy.

15:25.891 --> 15:28.223
Ray, for your information,
the interest rate aIone...

15:28.394 --> 15:31.329
...for the first five years
comes to 95,000 doIIars.

15:31.497 --> 15:34.489
WiII you guys reIax? We are
on the threshoId of estabIishing...

15:34.667 --> 15:37.727
...the indispensabIe defense science
of the next decade:

15:37.903 --> 15:41.498
ProfessionaI paranormaI
investigations and eIiminations.

15:41.674 --> 15:46.304
The franchise rights aIone wiII make
us rich beyond our wiIdest dreams.

15:46.478 --> 15:49.641
There's office space,
sleeping quarters and showers...

15:49.815 --> 15:51.407
...and there's a fuII kitchen.

15:51.583 --> 15:56.543
It just seems a IittIe pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's aII.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.519
What do you think, Egon?

15:58.691 --> 16:00.921
I think this buiIding
shouId be condemned.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.618
There's metaI fatigue
in aII the Ioad-bearing members.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.425
The wiring is substandard.
It's inadequate for our power needs.

16:07.599 --> 16:10.500
And the neighborhood
is Iike a demiIitarized zone.

16:10.669 --> 16:13.604
Hey, does this poIe stiII work?

16:16.408 --> 16:20.708
Wow, this pIace is great.
When can we move in?

16:20.879 --> 16:24.838
You gotta try this poIe.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

16:28.220 --> 16:33.248
Hey, we shouId stay here tonight,
sIeep here. You know, to try it out.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.197
-I think we'II take it.
-Good.

17:20.105 --> 17:21.333
Hi.

17:26.912 --> 17:29.346
-Dana, it's you.
-Hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.881
-I thought it was the drugstore.
-Are you sick?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.780
No, I'm fine. I feeI great.

17:33.952 --> 17:37.080
Just ordered some more vitamins
and stuff. I was just exercising.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.918
I taped 20-Minute Workout
and pIayed it at high speed...

17:40.092 --> 17:42.424
...so it onIy took 1 0 minutes.
I got a great workout.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.186
Want to come in for a mineraI water?

17:44.363 --> 17:47.628
I'd reaIIy Iike to, Louis,
but I have a rehearsaI. Excuse me.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.961
No sweat.
I'II take a rain check on that.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.571
I have pIenty of Iow-sodium mineraI
water and other nutritious foods.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.673
-But you aIready know that.
-I know that.

17:55.841 --> 17:58.901
Listen, that reminds me, I'm having
a big party for aII my cIients.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.773
My fourth anniversary
as an accountant.

18:00.946 --> 18:02.743
Even though you do
your own tax return...

18:02.915 --> 18:04.906
...stop by,
since you're my neighbor and aII.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.211
Thank you, Louis.
I'II reaIIy try to stop by.

18:07.486 --> 18:10.546
You shouIdn't Ieave your TV
on so Ioud when you go out.

18:10.722 --> 18:12.747
The creep down the haII
phoned the manager.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.916
That's strange.
I didn't reaIize I Ieft it on.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.927
I cIimbed on the Iedge
and tried to disconnect the cabIe...

18:18.097 --> 18:21.692
...but I couIdn't get in,
so I turned up my TV reaI Ioud too...

18:21.867 --> 18:25.166
...so everyone wouId think both our
TVs had something wrong with them.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.898
Okay, so I'II see you Iater, huh?
I'II give you a caII.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.139
I gotta have a shower.

18:36.181 --> 18:39.378
Are you troubled by strange noises
in the middle of the night?

18:39.551 --> 18:42.645
Do you experience feelings of dread
in your basement or attic?

18:42.821 --> 18:46.086
Have you or any of your family ever
seen a spook, specter or ghost?

18:46.258 --> 18:49.853
If the answer is yes, pick up your
phone and call the professionals.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.529
Ghostbusters.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.995
Our courteous staff is on call
2 4 hours a day...

18:54.166 --> 18:56.464
...to serve all your
supernatural-elimination needs.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.798
We're ready to believe you.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.072
ZuuI.

20:17.482 --> 20:18.915
You don't think it's too subtIe?

20:19.084 --> 20:22.884
You don't think peopIe are gonna
drive down and not see the sign?

20:30.896 --> 20:33.364
You can't park that here!

20:37.436 --> 20:39.631
Everybody can reIax, I found the car.

20:39.805 --> 20:42.239
Needs some suspension work
and shocks...

20:42.407 --> 20:46.434
...and brakes, brake pads, Iinings,
steering box, transmission, rear end.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.170
-How much?
-OnIy 4800.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.941
Maybe new rings, aIso muffIers,
a IittIe wiring.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.613
-Janine, any caIIs?
-No.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.314
-Any messages?
-No.

21:01.293 --> 21:04.660
-Any customers?
-No, Dr. Venkman.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.066
It's a good job, isn't it?

21:08.600 --> 21:11.626
Type something, wiII you?
We're paying for this stuff.

21:11.803 --> 21:15.102
Don't stare at me.
You've got the bug eyes.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.434
Janine?

21:17.609 --> 21:20.737
Sorry about the ''bug eyes'' thing.
I'II be in my office.

21:23.915 --> 21:26.748
You're very handy. I can teII.

21:28.353 --> 21:32.653
-I bet you Iike to read a Iot too.
-Print is dead.

21:33.058 --> 21:36.619
Oh, that's very fascinating to me.
I read a Iot myseIf.

21:36.795 --> 21:41.459
Some peopIe think I'm too inteIIectuaI,
but it's a fabuIous way to spend time.

21:41.633 --> 21:45.763
I aIso pIay racquetbaII.
Do you have any hobbies?

21:47.105 --> 21:49.869
I coIIect spores, moIds and fungus.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.178
HeIIo?

22:14.199 --> 22:17.430
Excuse me. Is this--?
This is the Ghostbusters' office.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.503
Yes, it is. Can I heIp you?

22:20.672 --> 22:24.574
I don't have an appointment.
I'd Iike to taIk to someone, pIease.

22:26.278 --> 22:29.907
I'm Peter Venkman. May I heIp you?

22:30.082 --> 22:35.452
WeII, I don't know. What I have
to say may sound a IittIe unusuaI.

22:35.620 --> 22:38.453
That's aII we get, day in, day out,
around this pIace.

22:38.623 --> 22:42.081
-Come into my office, Miss....
-Barrett. Dana Barrett.

22:42.260 --> 22:46.526
And this voice said, ''ZuuI,'' and then I
sIammed the refrigerator door and Ieft.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.758
That was two days ago, and I haven't
been back to my apartment.

22:49.935 --> 22:53.098
GeneraIIy, you don't see that kind
of behavior in a major appIiance.

22:53.271 --> 22:54.533
What do you think it was?

22:54.706 --> 22:57.231
WeII, if I knew what it was,
I wouIdn't be here.

22:57.409 --> 22:58.933
Egon, what do you think?

22:59.111 --> 23:02.239
She's teIIing the truth.
At Ieast she thinks she is.

23:02.581 --> 23:06.950
WeII, of course I'm teIIing the truth.
Who wouId make up a story Iike that?

23:07.119 --> 23:08.950
Some are peopIe
who just want attention.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.214
Others are nutbaIIs
who come off the street.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.793
You know what it couId be? Past Iife
experience intruding on present time.

23:15.961 --> 23:18.395
CouId be a memory stored
in the coIIective unconscious.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.794
I wouIdn't ruIe out cIairvoyance
or teIepathic contact either.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.527
I'm sorry, I don't beIieve
in any of those things.

23:24.703 --> 23:29.231
WeII, that's aII right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do...

23:29.408 --> 23:32.639
...standard procedures in a case
Iike this, which often bring us resuIts.

23:33.111 --> 23:36.137
I couId go to HaII of Records
for the buiIding's structuraI detaiIs.

23:36.314 --> 23:38.748
Maybe the buiIding has a history
of psychic turbuIence.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.145
Right. Good idea.

23:40.318 --> 23:42.445
I couId search ''ZuuI''
in the usuaI Iiterature.

23:42.621 --> 23:45.146
-Spates Catalog.
-Tobin's Spirit Guide.

23:45.323 --> 23:49.282
I'II take Miss Barrett back
to her apartment and check her out.

23:49.461 --> 23:53.420
I'II go check out
Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay?

23:54.032 --> 23:55.863
Okay.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.068
Thank you.

24:07.212 --> 24:08.645
PIease, Iet me.

24:08.814 --> 24:13.012
If something's gonna happen here,
I want it to happen to me first.

24:17.322 --> 24:19.381
That's the cIoset.

24:26.264 --> 24:28.129
They hate this.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.629
I Iike to torture them.

24:30.802 --> 24:34.670
That's right, boys. It's Dr. Venkman!

24:40.278 --> 24:42.303
It's a Iot of space.

24:43.615 --> 24:46.379
-Just you?
-Yes.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.351
Good.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.891
What is that thing you're doing?

24:55.627 --> 24:58.858
It's technicaI.
It's one of our IittIe toys.

24:59.030 --> 25:00.588
I see.

25:02.767 --> 25:06.669
That's the bedroom.
But nothing ever happened in there.

25:09.641 --> 25:11.734
What a crime.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.670
You know, you don't act
Iike a scientist.

25:16.848 --> 25:21.717
-They're usuaIIy pretty stiff.
-You're more Iike a game-show host.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.251
That's the kitchen, huh?

25:42.641 --> 25:44.666
-Dana, are these the eggs?
-Yes.

25:44.843 --> 25:48.074
I was over there, and these eggs
just jumped right out of their sheIIs...

25:48.246 --> 25:50.806
-...and started to cook on the counter.
-That is weird.

25:50.982 --> 25:55.078
That's when I started to hear that awfuI
noise coming from the refrigerator.

25:56.121 --> 26:00.558
You've come aII this way. WouId you
Iike to check the refrigerator?

26:02.027 --> 26:05.428
Better check the fridge. Good caII.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.800
Oh, my God.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.863
Look at aII the junk food.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.908
-No. Goddamn it! This wasn't--
-You actuaIIy eat this stuff?

26:19.077 --> 26:21.011
This wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

26:21.179 --> 26:24.740
There was a space and a buiIding
with fIames coming out of it.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.647
There were creatures writhing around,
and they were growIing and snarIing.

26:28.820 --> 26:31.584
And there were fIames,
and I heard a voice say, ''ZuuI.''

26:31.756 --> 26:33.121
It was right here.

26:33.291 --> 26:35.088
I'm sorry, I'm not getting any reading.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.354
WeII, are you sure
you're using that thing correctIy?

26:38.530 --> 26:42.591
I think so. But I'm sure
there are no animaIs in there.

26:42.767 --> 26:43.995
WeII, that's great.

26:44.169 --> 26:47.730
Either I have a monster in my kitchen,
or I'm compIeteIy crazy.

26:47.906 --> 26:50.238
I don't think you're crazy.

26:50.742 --> 26:53.870
Oh, good. That makes me
feeI so much better.

26:56.214 --> 26:57.806
Let me teII you something about me.

26:57.983 --> 27:01.077
I come home from work to my pIace,
and aII I have is my work.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.776
There's nothing eIse in my Iife.

27:02.954 --> 27:07.254
I meet you and say, ''There's someone
with the same probIem I have.''

27:07.425 --> 27:10.258
Yes, we both have
the same probIem. You.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.160
I'm gonna go for broke.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.704
-I am madIy in Iove with you.
-I don't beIieve this.

27:21.873 --> 27:24.433
WiII you pIease Ieave?

27:24.743 --> 27:28.008
And then she threw me out of her Iife.
She thought I was a creep.

27:28.179 --> 27:31.148
She thought I was a geek,
and she probabIy wasn't the first.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.614
You are so odd.

27:37.555 --> 27:39.989
-No.
-I've got it!

27:40.158 --> 27:42.956
-No.
-I'II prove myseIf to you.

27:43.128 --> 27:44.925
That's not necessary.

27:45.096 --> 27:47.826
-Yeah, I'II soIve your IittIe probIem.
-Okay.

27:47.999 --> 27:51.662
And then you'II say, ''Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.861
-I wonder what makes him tick.''
-I wonder.

27:54.039 --> 27:57.031
''I wonder if he'd be interested
in knowing what makes me tick.''

27:57.208 --> 27:59.802
I'II bet you're gonna be thinking
about me after I'm gone.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.570
I bet I am.

28:03.114 --> 28:04.775
No kiss?

28:14.726 --> 28:16.694
To our first customer.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.955
To our first and onIy customer.

28:21.299 --> 28:22.926
I'II need to draw some petty cash.

28:23.101 --> 28:25.899
I shouId take her out to dinner.
We don't want to Iose her.

28:26.137 --> 28:31.200
This magnificent feast here
represents the Iast of the petty cash.

28:32.911 --> 28:35.539
Hey, sIow down. Chew your food.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.113
HeIIo, Ghostbusters.

28:39.684 --> 28:42.585
Yes, of course they're serious.

28:44.522 --> 28:46.080
You do?

28:46.691 --> 28:48.625
You have?

28:48.793 --> 28:50.556
No kidding.

28:51.329 --> 28:54.594
WeII, just give me the address.

28:55.233 --> 28:59.499
Yes, of course.
Oh, they'II be totaIIy discreet.

29:00.371 --> 29:02.305
Thank you.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.732
We got one!

29:09.614 --> 29:11.343
It's a caII!

29:18.757 --> 29:20.452
Come on!

29:55.126 --> 29:57.390
Hey, anybody see a ghost?

30:02.267 --> 30:04.895
-Thank you for coming so quickIy.
-Jesus!

30:05.069 --> 30:07.902
The guests are asking questions,
and I'm running out of excuses.

30:08.072 --> 30:09.300
Has it happened before?

30:09.474 --> 30:12.136
WeII, most of the originaI staff
knows about the 1 2th fIoor.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.800
-The disturbances, I mean.
-Yeah.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.913
But it's been quiet for years
up untiI two weeks ago.

30:17.081 --> 30:18.844
It was never, ever this bad, though.

30:19.017 --> 30:23.078
-Did you ever report it to anyone?
-No. Heavens, no.

30:23.254 --> 30:25.848
The owners don't Iike us
to even taIk about it.

30:26.024 --> 30:28.083
I hope we couId take care
of this quietIy.

30:28.259 --> 30:29.487
-It's done.
-Tonight.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.219
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.990
We handIe this kind of thing
aII the time.

30:42.173 --> 30:45.506
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of a cosmonaut?

30:45.677 --> 30:49.545
No, we're exterminators. Somebody
saw a cockroach up on 1 2th.

30:49.714 --> 30:54.117
-That's gotta be some cockroach.
-Bite your head off, man.

30:57.856 --> 31:01.417
-Going up?
-I'II take the next one.

31:03.995 --> 31:07.897
It just occurred to me we haven't had
a successfuI test of this equipment.

31:08.066 --> 31:10.261
-I bIame myseIf.
-So do I.

31:10.435 --> 31:13.461
-WeII, no sense worrying about it now.
-Why worry?

31:13.638 --> 31:18.166
Each of us is wearing an unIicensed
nucIear acceIerator on his back.

31:18.343 --> 31:22.803
Yep. WeII, Iet's get ready.
Switch me on.

31:58.816 --> 32:01.512
What the heII are you doing?

32:02.954 --> 32:05.184
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

32:05.356 --> 32:07.381
We thought you were someone eIse.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.695
SuccessfuI test.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.825
I guess so.

32:14.365 --> 32:16.458
-I think we'd better spIit up.
-Good idea.

32:16.634 --> 32:18.602
Yeah, we can do
more damage that way.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.366
Venkman? Venkman!

32:57.141 --> 32:59.473
Disgusting bIob.

33:00.211 --> 33:02.543
I'm gonna have to hoId him myseIf.

33:44.088 --> 33:45.885
Come in, Ray.

33:47.558 --> 33:50.425
Venkman! I saw it! I saw it!

33:50.762 --> 33:52.593
It's right here, Ray.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.322
It's Iooking at me.

33:54.499 --> 33:56.433
He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?

33:56.601 --> 33:58.091
I think he can hear you, Ray.

33:58.269 --> 34:00.203
Don't move. It won't hurt you.

34:07.912 --> 34:09.743
Venkman!

34:11.581 --> 34:14.210
Venkman! Pete!

34:16.821 --> 34:18.846
Venkman, what happened?
Are you okay?

34:19.023 --> 34:20.456
He sIimed me.

34:20.625 --> 34:24.025
That's great! ActuaI physicaI contact!

34:24.195 --> 34:26.356
-Can you move?
-Ray. Ray! Come in, please!

34:26.531 --> 34:27.862
I feeI so funky.

34:28.032 --> 34:30.523
SpengIer! I'm with Venkman.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.201
He got sIimed!

34:32.370 --> 34:34.600
That's great, Ray. Save some for me.

34:34.772 --> 34:37.239
Get down here, right away!
It just went into a ballroom.

34:37.408 --> 34:38.636
Okay, we'II be right there.

34:41.646 --> 34:44.114
Sir, if you and your staff
couId pIease wait out here...

34:44.282 --> 34:46.750
...we'II take care of everything.

35:05.169 --> 35:07.694
There it is. On the ceiIing.

35:10.007 --> 35:12.407
That's the one that got me.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.382
AII right, boys.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.281
Ready?

35:23.454 --> 35:24.785
Throw it!

35:34.365 --> 35:35.798
I did that. I did that.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.629
-That's my fauIt.
-It's okay. The tabIe broke the faII.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.628
There's something very important
I forgot to teII you.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.138
-What?
-Don't cross the streams.

35:45.009 --> 35:46.874
-Why?
-It wouId be bad.

35:47.245 --> 35:50.772
I'm fuzzy on the whoIe goodlbad thing.
What do you mean, ''bad''?

35:50.948 --> 35:54.440
Imagine aII Iife as you know it stopping
instantaneousIy and every moIecuIe...

35:54.619 --> 35:57.053
...in your body expIoding
at the speed of Iight.

35:57.788 --> 35:59.483
TotaI protonic reversaI.

35:59.657 --> 36:03.593
Right, that's bad. Okay,
important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

36:03.761 --> 36:08.164
AII right, Ray, take the Ieft.
Egon, take the right.

36:14.705 --> 36:17.333
Okay, Ray, just give me
one high and outside.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.237
Ray!

36:21.913 --> 36:23.380
Egon!

36:31.155 --> 36:33.146
Okay, aII right.
HoId it, hoId it, hoId it!

36:36.661 --> 36:38.219
Nice shooting, Tex!

36:38.396 --> 36:40.728
I assure you, there is no probIem
with the room.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.162
It'II be ready as soon as your guests
are with us.

36:43.334 --> 36:45.325
It took something out of him,
but he'II move.

36:45.503 --> 36:48.495
I need some room to put the trap
down. Give me some room.

36:49.340 --> 36:51.638
You'II excuse me, pIease.

36:58.082 --> 37:01.074
-Gotta get this in the cIear.
-Wait, wait, wait!

37:01.252 --> 37:03.846
I've aIways wanted to do this.

37:04.021 --> 37:05.579
And....

37:05.756 --> 37:08.623
-The fIowers are stiII standing!
-Okay, on my go-signaI.

37:08.793 --> 37:12.024
SpengIer, I want a confinement stream
from you, okay? Go!

37:12.196 --> 37:14.960
Okay, hoId him up there.
He's gonna move. HoId him up!

37:15.132 --> 37:16.531
Go!

37:18.369 --> 37:20.360
-It's working, Ray.
-Start bringing him down.

37:20.538 --> 37:22.130
You got him. Don't cross the stream.

37:22.306 --> 37:26.470
Maybe now you'II never sIime a guy
with a positron coIIider, huh?

37:26.644 --> 37:29.977
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

37:30.214 --> 37:33.206
I'm opening the trap now.
Don't Iook directIy into the trap.

37:34.318 --> 37:35.979
I Iooked at the trap, Ray.

37:36.153 --> 37:40.556
Turn your streams off when I cIose
the trap. Get ready. I'm cIosing it.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.659
Now!

38:01.178 --> 38:02.543
It's in there.

38:05.816 --> 38:08.011
WeII, that wasn't such a chore,
now, was it?

38:10.821 --> 38:13.119
Mr. Smith, quickIy.
I want that door open now!

38:13.291 --> 38:15.054
DonaId, stand over there.

38:15.726 --> 38:18.422
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

38:18.596 --> 38:19.995
Did you see it? What is it?

38:20.164 --> 38:21.426
We got it.

38:21.599 --> 38:23.590
What is it?
WiII there be any more of them?

38:23.768 --> 38:26.760
What you had there
was what we refer to as a focused...

38:26.937 --> 38:30.668
...non-terminaI repeating phantasm,
or a cIass-five fuII-roaming vapor.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.570
ReaI nasty one too.

38:32.743 --> 38:34.608
And now...

38:34.779 --> 38:36.041
...Iet's taIk seriousIy.

38:36.213 --> 38:40.616
For the entrapment, we're gonna have
to ask you for four big ones, $4000.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.948
But we are having a speciaI this week
on proton charging...

38:44.121 --> 38:45.554
...and storage of the beast.

38:45.723 --> 38:48.055
That's onIy gonna come to
1 000 doIIars, fortunateIy.

38:48.225 --> 38:51.854
Five thousand doIIars? I had no idea
it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

38:52.029 --> 38:54.190
WeII, that's aII right.
We can just put it back.

38:54.365 --> 38:56.230
We certainIy can, Dr. Venkman.

38:56.400 --> 39:00.029
No! AII right! Anything.

39:00.204 --> 39:01.466
Thanks so much.

39:01.639 --> 39:03.368
Thank you. Hope
we can heIp you again.

39:03.541 --> 39:06.408
Coming through! One cIass-five
free-roaming vapor.

39:06.577 --> 39:09.512
Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today, the entire Eastern seaboard...

39:09.680 --> 39:12.945
...is alive with talk of incidents
of paranormal activity.

39:13.117 --> 39:16.052
Alleged ghost-sightings
and supernatural occurrences...

39:16.220 --> 39:18.950
...have been reported
across the entire tri-state area.

39:19.123 --> 39:21.523
Everybody has heard ghost stories
around the campfire.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.855
My grandma used to spin yarns
about a spectraI Iocomotive...

39:25.029 --> 39:27.520
...that wouId rocket past the farm
where she grew up.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.791
But now, as if
some unforeseen authority....

39:50.187 --> 39:51.518
Stand aside, pIease!

39:51.689 --> 39:54.817
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic, ghosts and ghostbusting.

39:54.992 --> 39:57.654
The controversy buiIds,
more sightings are reported.

39:57.828 --> 39:59.318
Some maintain that these...

39:59.497 --> 40:03.194
...professionaI paranormaI eIiminators
in New York are the cause of it aII.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.168
I got it! I got it!

40:11.742 --> 40:12.970
Pete! Ray!

40:22.086 --> 40:24.213
Still making headlines
all across the country...

40:24.388 --> 40:27.983
...the Ghostbusters are at it again,
this time at the dance club...

40:28.159 --> 40:31.959
... The Rose. The boys in gray slugged
it out with a pesky poltergeist...

40:32.129 --> 40:36.031
...then stayed to dance with the ladies
who witnessed the disturbance.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.226
This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.

40:39.403 --> 40:41.530
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

40:41.705 --> 40:44.401
No job is too big. No fee is too big.

40:45.843 --> 40:48.334
Is it just a mist,
or does it have arms and Iegs?

40:48.512 --> 40:51.276
As they say in TV, I'm sure
there's one big question...

40:51.449 --> 40:54.509
...on everybody's mind, and I imagine
you are the man to answer that.

40:54.685 --> 40:57.848
How is Elvis,
and have you seen him lately?

41:42.199 --> 41:44.429
Do you beIieve in UFOs,
astraI projections...

41:44.602 --> 41:47.036
...mentaI teIepathy, ESP,
cIairvoyance...

41:47.204 --> 41:50.230
...spirit photography,
teIekinetic movement...

41:50.407 --> 41:55.310
...fuII-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of AtIantis?

41:55.479 --> 41:59.609
If there's a steady paycheck in it,
I'II beIieve anything you say.

42:00.784 --> 42:03.753
I gotta get some sIeep. I'm dying.

42:03.921 --> 42:05.354
You don't Iook good.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.491
-I don't?
-WeII, you've Iooked better.

42:07.658 --> 42:09.285
You didn't used to Iook Iike this.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.360
Can you hoId, pIease?

42:11.529 --> 42:14.089
Here's the paper on the BrookIyn.
She paid with Visa.

42:14.265 --> 42:16.426
Here's tonight's worksheet.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.227
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.

42:18.402 --> 42:21.394
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

42:21.572 --> 42:24.439
BeautifuI. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

42:24.608 --> 42:27.907
-CongratuIations.
-Can you heIp me, pIease?

42:31.348 --> 42:32.838
WeIcome aboard.

42:34.084 --> 42:36.609
I don't know where they get
these guest conductors.

42:36.787 --> 42:39.381
It's not gonna do him much good
to scream at us in German.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.958
WeII, I don't think that the man
is competent to conduct...

42:43.127 --> 42:44.560
...a major symphony orchestra.

42:45.796 --> 42:50.893
-CouId you wait here a minute?
-Sure.

42:56.273 --> 42:58.503
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

42:58.676 --> 43:00.940
-That was a wonderfuI rehearsaI.
-You heard that?

43:01.111 --> 43:03.045
Yes. You're the best one in your row.

43:03.213 --> 43:04.646
Oh, thank you.

43:04.815 --> 43:08.376
You're good. Most peopIe can't hear
me with the whoIe orchestra pIaying.

43:08.552 --> 43:10.144
I don't have to take this abuse.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.619
I got hundreds of peopIe
dying to abuse me.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.849
I know. You're a big ceIebrity now.

43:15.025 --> 43:18.222
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.227
Who's the stiff?

43:24.969 --> 43:27.938
The ''stiff'' happens to be one of
the finest musicians in the worId.

43:28.105 --> 43:30.005
Do you have information
for me, pIease?

43:30.174 --> 43:32.574
WeII, sure, but I prefer
to give it to you in private.

43:32.743 --> 43:36.144
-Why don't you teII me now.
-Okay. I found the name ZuuI for you.

43:36.313 --> 43:41.808
The name ZuuI refers to a demigod
worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the....

43:42.219 --> 43:44.187
What's that word?

43:44.388 --> 43:45.946
-''Hittites.''
-Hittites...

43:46.123 --> 43:49.217
...the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

43:50.127 --> 43:52.595
''ZuuI was the minion of Gozer.''

43:52.763 --> 43:54.958
What's Gozer?

43:55.132 --> 43:59.466
-Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
-WeII, what's he doing in my icebox?

43:59.637 --> 44:02.504
I'm working on that. If we couId
get together Thursday night...

44:02.673 --> 44:06.006
...I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we couId exchange information.

44:06.176 --> 44:09.475
I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.

44:09.647 --> 44:13.048
Miss Barrett, you seem to think there
is something wrong up here that says:

44:13.217 --> 44:17.415
''He enjoys taking his evenings off
and spending it with his cIients.''

44:17.588 --> 44:20.489
No. I'm making a speciaI exception
in your case...

44:20.658 --> 44:22.216
...because...

44:22.660 --> 44:23.888
...I respect you.

44:24.061 --> 44:26.188
It's corny, but I respect you
as an artist.

44:26.363 --> 44:30.459
As a dresser too. This is a magnificent
coordination you have going today.

44:30.634 --> 44:32.932
-See you Thursday.
-I'II bring the Roylance Guide...

44:33.103 --> 44:35.298
...and we'II eat and read.

44:41.912 --> 44:44.176
-So who the heII is that?
-He's just a friend.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.747
-A friend?
-An oId friend.

44:45.916 --> 44:47.611
Bye! WeII, I'II see you Thursday!

44:47.785 --> 44:51.482
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm gIad you're feeIing much better.

44:51.655 --> 44:54.522
You're stiII very paIe, though.
A IittIe sun.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.354
-WeII, what does he do?
-He's a scientist.

45:08.706 --> 45:12.870
This is where we store aII the vapors
and entities and sIimers that we trap.

45:13.043 --> 45:18.504
Very simpIe, reaIIy. A Ioaded trap
here. Open, unIock the system.

45:18.682 --> 45:19.910
Insert the trap.

45:21.785 --> 45:23.753
ReIease.

45:24.655 --> 45:28.318
CIose, Iock the system.
Set your entry grid.

45:28.492 --> 45:29.925
Neutronize your fieId.

45:30.260 --> 45:32.057
And...

45:32.229 --> 45:34.857
...when the Iight is green,
the trap is cIean.

45:35.032 --> 45:37.967
The ghost is incarcerated here
in our custom storage faciIity.

45:38.135 --> 45:41.730
There's a man from the EPA here
to see you. He's waiting in your office.

45:41.905 --> 45:44.567
-EPA? What's he want?
-I don't know.

45:44.742 --> 45:47.711
AII I do know is I've been working
two weeks without a break...

45:47.878 --> 45:50.574
...and you promised me
you'd hire more heIp.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.080
Janine, someone
with your quaIifications...

45:53.250 --> 45:57.118
...wouId have no troubIe finding
a topfIight job in either...

45:57.287 --> 46:00.120
...the food service or
housekeeping industries.

46:00.891 --> 46:04.952
-Are you gonna answer that?
-I've quit better jobs than this.

46:05.696 --> 46:07.596
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

46:07.765 --> 46:07.898
-Can I heIp you?
-I'm WaIter Peck.

46:07.898 --> 46:10.332
-Can I heIp you?
-I'm WaIter Peck.

46:10.501 --> 46:14.198
I represent the EnvironmentaI
Protection Agency, the third district.

46:14.371 --> 46:16.862
Great. How's it going down there?

46:19.109 --> 46:21.077
Are you Peter Venkman?

46:22.045 --> 46:23.740
Yes, I'm...

46:23.914 --> 46:25.142
...Dr. Venkman.

46:25.315 --> 46:28.113
ExactIy what are you a doctor of,
Mr. Venkman?

46:28.285 --> 46:31.686
WeII, I have Ph.D.'s in parapsychoIogy
and psychoIogy.

46:32.456 --> 46:34.287
I see.

46:34.458 --> 46:37.325
And now you catch ghosts.

46:37.494 --> 46:39.485
Yeah. You couId say that.

46:39.963 --> 46:42.488
And how many ghosts have you
caught, Mr. Venkman?

46:42.666 --> 46:45.328
-I'm not at Iiberty to say.
-And where do you put...

46:45.502 --> 46:48.369
...these ghosts
once you catch them?

46:48.539 --> 46:51.007
Into a storage faciIity.

46:51.375 --> 46:54.503
And wouId this storage faciIity
be Iocated on these premises?

46:54.678 --> 46:59.342
-Yes.
-And may I see this storage faciIity?

46:59.516 --> 47:02.883
-No.
-And why not, Mr. Venkman?

47:04.454 --> 47:07.685
Because you did not use
the magic word.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.555
What is the magic word,
Mr. Venkman?

47:15.065 --> 47:16.293
''PIease.''

47:17.668 --> 47:21.399
May I pIease see the storage faciIity,
Mr. Venkman?

47:21.572 --> 47:23.096
Why do you want to see it?

47:23.273 --> 47:25.537
WeII, because I'm curious.

47:25.843 --> 47:28.073
I want to know more about
what you do here.

47:28.745 --> 47:31.305
There've been a Iot of wiId
stories in the media...

47:31.481 --> 47:34.211
...and we want to assess
any possibIe environmentaI impact...

47:34.384 --> 47:35.715
...from your operation.

47:35.886 --> 47:37.911
For instance, the presence
of noxious...

47:38.088 --> 47:41.387
...possibIy hazardous waste chemicaIs
in your basement.

47:41.558 --> 47:45.756
Now, you show me what is down there,
or I come back with a court order.

47:46.763 --> 47:50.859
You go get a court order, and I'II sue
your ass for wrongfuI prosecution!

47:51.635 --> 47:54.399
You can have it your way,
Mr. Venkman.

47:55.005 --> 47:57.496
I'm worried. It's crowded in there,
and my data...

47:57.674 --> 48:00.472
...points to something big
on the horizon.

48:00.644 --> 48:02.578
What do you mean ''big''?

48:03.180 --> 48:07.583
WeII, Iet's say this Twinkie
represents the normaI amount...

48:07.751 --> 48:10.311
...of psychokinetic energy
in the New York area.

48:10.487 --> 48:14.218
According to this morning's sampIe,
it wouId be a Twinkie...

48:14.391 --> 48:17.918
...35 feet Iong, weighing
approximateIy 600 pounds.

48:19.363 --> 48:21.024
That's a big Twinkie.

48:21.198 --> 48:23.462
We couId be on the verge
of a fourfoId cross-rip...

48:23.634 --> 48:26.228
...a PKE surge of incredibIe,
even dangerous, proportions.

48:27.704 --> 48:31.140
We just had a visit from the
EnvironmentaI Protection Agency.

48:31.308 --> 48:33.503
-How's the grid hoIding up?
-Not good.

48:33.677 --> 48:35.542
TeII him about the Twinkie.

48:36.480 --> 48:38.038
What about the Twinkie?

49:33.303 --> 49:35.567
-Oh, Dana, it's you.
-HeIIo, Louis.

49:35.739 --> 49:38.572
You gotta come in here.
You're missing a cIassic party.

49:38.742 --> 49:42.906
Yes, weII, I wouId, Louis,
but I have a date coming over.

49:46.116 --> 49:47.708
You made a date...

49:47.884 --> 49:54.153
-...tonight?
-WeII, I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

49:55.225 --> 49:58.956
Oh, that's okay.
You can bring him aIong.

49:59.396 --> 50:02.559
AII right. Maybe we'II stop by, okay?

50:03.033 --> 50:04.591
That's great. I'II teII everybody.

50:04.768 --> 50:07.669
We're gonna pIay Twister,
we're gonna do some breakdancing....

50:07.838 --> 50:09.635
Hey--

50:10.407 --> 50:14.207
Hey, Iet me in! It's Louis!
Somebody, Iet me in!

50:39.336 --> 50:40.860
HeIIo?

50:41.038 --> 50:43.097
Hi, Mom.

50:43.273 --> 50:44.968
I've been busy.

50:45.142 --> 50:47.633
WeII.... No, everything is fine.

50:47.811 --> 50:51.008
Yeah. No, just that one time.

50:51.181 --> 50:53.240
Oh, I am.

50:54.117 --> 50:55.880
I wiII.

50:57.154 --> 51:01.784
I won't. Mom, I have to go.
I have a date.

51:02.059 --> 51:06.189
Yes. No, no one you know. It's....

51:07.164 --> 51:09.928
WeII, he's a Ghostbuster.

51:10.534 --> 51:12.695
Those guys on TV.

51:13.603 --> 51:15.434
Yes, weII, I'II have to Iet you know.

51:15.605 --> 51:18.073
Okay. Love to Dad.

51:18.241 --> 51:21.836
Right. Bye. Bye.

51:42.232 --> 51:44.257
Oh, shit.

52:15.765 --> 52:15.932
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength TyIenoI?

52:15.932 --> 52:18.992
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength TyIenoI?

52:19.169 --> 52:22.400
Gee, I think aII I got is
acetyIsaIicyIic acid. Generic.

52:22.572 --> 52:26.406
I can get 600 tabIets of that for the
same price as 300 of the name brand.

52:26.576 --> 52:28.806
Makes good financiaI sense.
Good advice.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.573
Hey, this is reaI smoked saImon
from Nova Scotia, Canada...

52:31.748 --> 52:32.976
...2 4.95 a pound.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.516
It onIy cost me 1 4.1 2
after tax, though.

52:35.685 --> 52:37.482
I'm giving this as
a promotionaI expense.

52:37.654 --> 52:41.556
That's why I invited cIients instead
of friends. Having a good time, Marv?

52:41.725 --> 52:44.250
How you doing? Have some Brie.
It's at room temperature.

52:44.427 --> 52:46.224
You think it's too warm for Brie?

52:46.396 --> 52:48.557
Louis, I'm going home.

52:48.732 --> 52:51.394
Don't Ieave yet. Listen,
maybe if we start dancing...

52:51.568 --> 52:53.559
...other peopIe wiII join in.

52:53.737 --> 52:55.602
Okay.

52:58.375 --> 53:01.242
Oh, don't move.
I just gotta get the door.

53:02.679 --> 53:04.374
-Ted! Annette!
-Hi.

53:04.548 --> 53:06.948
I'm gIad you couId come.
Give me your coats.

53:07.117 --> 53:09.608
Everybody, this is Ted
and Annette FIeming.

53:09.786 --> 53:11.048
How are you?

53:11.221 --> 53:14.088
Ted has a smaII carpet-cIeaning
business in receivership.

53:14.257 --> 53:17.488
Annette's drawing a saIary from
a deferred bonus from two years ago.

53:17.661 --> 53:21.688
They got 1 5,000 Ieft
on the house at 8 percent.

53:21.865 --> 53:24.231
So they're okay!

53:24.401 --> 53:26.665
Does anybody want
to pIay Parcheesi?

53:29.806 --> 53:31.569
Okay, who brought the dog?

53:53.463 --> 53:58.526
HeIp! There's a bear Ioose
in my apartment! HeIp! HeIp!

54:00.904 --> 54:02.269
HeIp!

54:02.439 --> 54:05.465
-What?
-A bear in his apartment.

54:09.913 --> 54:12.040
I'm gonna bring this up
at the tenants' meeting.

54:12.215 --> 54:15.582
There's not supposed to be
any pets in the buiIding.

54:30.634 --> 54:35.333
Let me in. There's gotta be a way
in here. I gotta get--

54:38.575 --> 54:41.442
Somebody, Iet me in!

54:47.784 --> 54:49.081
Nice doggy.

54:49.252 --> 54:51.186
Cute IittIe pooch.

54:51.354 --> 54:54.255
Maybe I got a MiIk-Bone.

55:13.743 --> 55:15.643
-What happened?
-Some moron brought...

55:15.812 --> 55:18.872
...a cougar to a party,
and it went berserk.

55:20.750 --> 55:23.082
Hi, I'm going up to Dana Barrett's.

55:43.306 --> 55:45.331
HeIIo?

55:47.844 --> 55:50.369
That's a different Iook for you,
isn't it?

55:50.547 --> 55:52.606
Are you the Keymaster?

55:54.384 --> 55:56.477
Not that I know of.

56:08.465 --> 56:10.524
Are you the Keymaster?

56:10.700 --> 56:11.928
Yes.

56:12.335 --> 56:15.270
I'm a friend of his.
He toId me to meet him here.

56:15.939 --> 56:18.499
-I didn't get your name.
-I am ZuuI.

56:18.675 --> 56:20.836
I am the Gatekeeper.

56:26.649 --> 56:31.450
-What are we doing today, ZuuI?
-Prepare for the coming of Gozer.

56:32.255 --> 56:33.779
Gozer, huh?

56:34.891 --> 56:36.654
The Destructor.

56:44.968 --> 56:46.196
Are we stiII going out?

56:49.339 --> 56:52.900
You know, you couId pick up the pIace
if you're expecting someone.

56:53.576 --> 56:56.477
Do you want this body?

56:57.147 --> 56:58.614
Is this a trick question?

57:02.185 --> 57:04.483
I guess the roses worked, huh?

57:04.654 --> 57:06.713
Take me now...

57:06.890 --> 57:08.482
...sub-creature.

57:08.658 --> 57:10.489
We never taIk anymore.

57:11.261 --> 57:16.631
Easy. I make it a ruIe never to get
invoIved with possessed peopIe.

57:18.835 --> 57:20.700
It's more of a guideIine than a ruIe.

57:20.870 --> 57:22.269
You know, I can--

57:22.439 --> 57:24.839
I want you inside me.

57:26.142 --> 57:27.769
Go ahead. No, I can't.

57:27.944 --> 57:30.640
Sounds Iike you got at Ieast
two peopIe in there aIready.

57:30.814 --> 57:32.645
Might be a IittIe crowded.

57:32.816 --> 57:35.080
Come on, why don't you
just quit trying...

57:35.251 --> 57:38.345
...to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman
and just reIax.

57:38.521 --> 57:42.082
Lie down there. ReIax.
Put your hands on your chest.

57:42.258 --> 57:45.091
What I'd reaIIy Iike to do
is taIk to Dana.

57:45.261 --> 57:47.126
I want to taIk to Dana.

57:47.297 --> 57:48.696
Dana, it's Peter.

57:48.865 --> 57:52.596
There is no Dana.
There is onIy ZuuI.

57:52.802 --> 57:54.702
Oh, ZuuIie, you nut. Come on.

57:55.305 --> 57:57.637
Come on, I want to taIk
to Dana. Dana.

57:57.807 --> 58:00.173
Just reIax. Come on. Dana.

58:00.343 --> 58:02.243
Dana. Can I taIk to Dana?

58:02.412 --> 58:06.143
There is no Dana, onIy ZuuI.

58:06.316 --> 58:08.910
What a IoveIy singing voice
you must have.

58:09.085 --> 58:11.076
Now, I'm gonna count
to three, ZuuIie.

58:11.254 --> 58:12.812
And if I don't taIk to Dana...

58:13.623 --> 58:16.683
...there's gonna be some reaI troubIe
in this apartment, I think.

58:16.860 --> 58:18.293
One.

58:20.663 --> 58:22.324
Two.

58:23.933 --> 58:25.560
Two and a haIf.

59:09.312 --> 59:11.007
PIease come down.

59:13.016 --> 59:13.182
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.

59:13.182 --> 59:18.484
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.

59:18.655 --> 59:21.715
The TraveIer. The Destroyer.

59:27.564 --> 59:29.259
Gatekeeper.

59:35.071 --> 59:36.333
I am Vinz.

59:36.506 --> 59:38.906
Vinz CIortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

59:39.075 --> 59:42.670
VoIguus ZiIdrohar, Lord of the
SebouiIIia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

59:42.845 --> 59:45.780
He puIIs the wagon, I make
the deaIs. You want a ride?

59:55.024 --> 59:58.653
Wait for the sign.
Then aII prisoners wiII be reIeased.

59:58.828 --> 01:00:02.423
You wiII perish in fIame,
you and aII your kind! Gatekeeper!

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:04.129
What an asshoIe.

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:13.371
-Dropping off or picking up?
-Dropping off.

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.534
Just a moment.

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:20.845
-You a Ghostbuster?
-Yes.

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:23.178
We picked up this guy.
We don't know what to do.

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.685
BeIIevue doesn't want him.
I'm afraid to Iock him up.

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:28.618
I know you guys are into this
stuff, so I figured we'd check.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.691
AII right.

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:35.890
Are you the Gatekeeper?

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:41.199
You better bring him inside.

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:44.829
You are so kind to take
care of that man.

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:46.908
You know, you are
a reaI humanitarian.

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:49.510
I don't think he's human.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.011
What did you say your name was?

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:02.217
Vinz CIortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:04.553
According to this,
his name's Louis TuIIy.

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:07.161
Lives on CentraI Park West.

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:11.333
Do you want some coffee, Mr. TuIIy?

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.535
-Do I?
-Yes, have some.

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:14.965
Yes, have some.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.434
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.306
-What sign are you waiting for?
-Gozer the TraveIer.

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:25.709
He wiII come in one
of the pre-chosen forms.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:30.148
During rectification of the VuIdronaii,
the TraveIer came as a Iarge Torb.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.087
Then, during the third reconciIiation
of the Meketrex suppIicants...

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:37.749
...they chose a new form for him,
that of a giant SIoar!

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:40.327
Many Shubs and ZuuIs knew
what it was to be roasted...

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:43.056
...in the depths of the SIoar that day,
I can teII you.

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:46.565
-Egon.
-Excuse me.

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:51.732
There's something very strange
about that man.

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:56.707
I'm usuaIIy very psychic,
and I have a terribIe feeIing...

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:59.973
...that something awfuI
is gonna happen to you.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.478
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:07.048
I'II get it.

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:12.022
-HeIIo?
-Egon, it's Peter.

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:15.426
-Thanks, I've got it.
-I have news from the worId of Gozer.

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:18.761
-What is it, Peter?
-I'm here with Dana Barrett.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.563
It seems the Goz has been
putting some moves...

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.764
-...on my wouId-be girIfriend.
-How is she?

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:28.502
I think we can get her
a guest shot on Wild Kingdom.

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:31.579
I just whacked her up
with about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.878
She's gonna take a IittIe nap now,
but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:38.452
-Does that make any sense to you?
-Some.

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:41.215
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:44.120
Oh, wonderfuI. We have
to get these two together.

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:49.062
I think that wouId be
extraordinariIy dangerous.

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:52.565
Okay, weII, hoId onto him.
I'II be there in a IittIe whiIe.

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:54.930
Good.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:03:00.041
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find Ray.
I need him here immediateIy.

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.981
Bad news, honey, I gotta go to work.

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:11.052
Hey, wiII you stay here in bed
untiI I get back?

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:25.032
-Hey, Ray, do you beIieve in God?
-Never met him.

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:29.729
Yeah, weII, I do. And I Iove
Jesus' styIe, you know?

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:33.808
This roof cap is made of
a magnesium-tungsten aIIoy.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.308
What are you so invoIved
with there?

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.812
These are bIueprints for the ironwork
in Dana Barrett's apartment...

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:42.780
...and they're very, very strange.

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:46.479
Hey, Ray, do you remember
something in the BibIe about...

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:50.649
...the Iast days, when the dead
wouId rise from the grave?

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:53.926
I remember ReveIations 7:1 2.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:56.490
And I Iooked as he opened
the sixth seaI.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.634
And behoId, there was
a great earthquake.

01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:01.201
And the sun became
as bIack as sackcIoth.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.129
And the moon became as bIood.

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:06.241
And the seas boiIed.
And the skies feII.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:11.002
-Judgment day.
-Judgment day.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.047
Every ancient reIigion has its myth
about the end of the worId.

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:17.914
Myth? Ray, has it ever
occurred to you...

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:20.214
...maybe the reason
we've been so busy...

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:23.517
...is because the dead have
been rising from the grave?

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:33.092
-How about a IittIe music?
-Yeah.

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:13.565
This way.

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:26.714
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Just where do you think you're going?

01:05:26.889 --> 01:05:29.915
Step aside, or you'II be arrested
for interfering with the poIice.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:32.560
Oh, no. HoId on. I've seen TV.
You can't come in here...

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:34.355
...without a warrant or a writ.

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:37.590
Cease and Desist AII Commerce
order. Seizure of Premises.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:40.565
Ban of PubIic UtiIities
for Non-Licensed Waste HandIers...

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:43.534
...and a federaI
Entry and Inspection order.

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:46.534
Vinz, there's one more test
I'd Iike to perform.

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:51.169
Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:55.078
-Excuse me, this is private property.
-Shut this off. Shut these aII off.

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:58.118
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines is hazardous.

01:05:58.287 --> 01:06:00.619
I'II teII you hazardous.
You're facing prosecution...

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.054
...for a haIf-a-dozen
environmentaI vioIations.

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:05.659
You shut off these beams,
or we shut them off for you.

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:13.163
Understand, this is a high-voItage
Iaser containment system.

01:06:13.336 --> 01:06:16.169
SimpIy turning it off wouId be
Iike dropping a bomb in the city.

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:19.672
Don't patronize me. I'm not stupid,
Iike the peopIe you biIk.

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:23.300
At ease, officer. I'm Peter Venkman.
There's been a misunderstanding...

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.504
...and I want to cooperate
in any way I can.

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:28.206
Forget it. You had your chance
to cooperate...

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:32.013
...but you thought it'd be more fun to
insuIt me. Now it is my turn, wise-ass.

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:34.179
He wants to shut down
the protection grid.

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:36.951
You shut that thing down,
we won't be heId responsibIe--

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:40.960
-You'II be responsibIe. Shut it off.
-No, we won't be heId responsibIe.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:44.122
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:47.895
I've never seen anything Iike this.
I don't know--

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:51.562
Yeah, I'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.934
My friend, don't be a jerk.

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:57.671
-Step aside.
-If he does that again, you shoot him.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.974
You do your job.
Don't teII me how to do mine.

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.879
-Thank you, officer.
-Shut it off!

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:27.041
Oh, shit.

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:44.753
CIear the buiIding!

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:16.786
This is it. This is the sign.

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:20.895
Yeah, it's a sign, aII right.
We're going out of business.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.899
Hey, aim up there.

01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:35.276
-What happened?
-Storage faciIity bIew.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.969
-He shut off the protection grid.
-Oh, great.

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.944
-That's bad, isn't it?
-Yeah.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:42.710
-Where's the Keymaster?
-Shit.

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:45.183
-Who's the Keymaster?
-Oh, come on.

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:48.283
HoId it. I want this man arrested.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.893
These men are in criminaI vioIation
of the EnvironmentaI Protection Act.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.654
-This expIosion is a direct resuIt of it.
-Your mother!

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.162
Come on, hoId it! HoId it! HoId it!

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:47.571
CoIumbia BuiIding, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry, so Iet's not dawdIe.

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:43.965
Hey, guard!

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:46.437
Look, I want to make a phone caII.

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:49.100
I just work with these guys.
I wasn't even there.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:52.441
The structure of this roof cap
is Iike the teIemetry tracker...

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:56.608
...that NASA uses to identify
dead puIsars in deep space.

01:10:56.785 --> 01:11:02.849
CoId-riveted girders
with cores of pure seIenium.

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:05.118
Everybody getting this so far?

01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:08.593
So what? I guess they just don't
make them Iike they used to.

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:11.096
No. Nobody ever made
them Iike this.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:16.034
The architect was either a certified
genius or an authentic wacko.

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:19.231
Ray, for a moment...

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:22.536
...pretend that I don't know
anything about metaIIurgy...

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:27.944
...engineering or physics and just
teII me what the heII is going on.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.218
You never studied.

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:34.587
The whoIe buiIding is a huge
superconductive antenna...

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:37.191
...that was designed and
buiIt for the purpose...

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:40.556
...of puIIing in and concentrating
spirituaI turbuIence.

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:46.326
Your girIfriend Iives in the
corner penthouse of spook centraI.

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:50.361
She's not my girIfriend.

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:54.031
I find her interesting because she's
a cIient and sIeeps above her covers.

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:58.202
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drooIs. She cIaws.

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.814
It's not the girI, Peter,
it's the buiIding.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:05.010
Something terribIe is about to enter
our worId. This buiIding is the door.

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:07.155
The architect's name
was Ivo Shandor.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:10.952
I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide.
He was aIso a doctor.

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.617
He performed a Iot
of unnecessary surgery.

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:16.663
And then, in 1 920,
he started a secret society.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:20.632
-Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
-Right.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:22.993
No studying.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:28.769
After WorId War I, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:35.409
He wasn't aIone. He had cIose
to a thousand foIIowers when he died.

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:37.518
They conducted rituaIs
up on the roof...

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:41.247
...bizarre rituaIs intended to bring
about the end of the worId.

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:44.415
And now it Iooks Iike
it may actuaIIy happen.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.927
We have to get out of here
and find a judge or something.

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:57.561
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey. HoId it.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.905
Are we going to go
before a judge to say...

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:03.340
...that a BabyIonian god is
gonna drop in on CentraI Park West...

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:06.606
-...and start tearing up the city?
-Sumerian, not BabyIonian.

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:09.444
-Yeah, big difference.
-No offense...

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:11.279
...but I gotta get my own Iawyer.

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:14.047
Okay, Ghostbusters.
The mayor wants to see you guys.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:16.123
The whoIe isIand's going crazy.
Let's go.

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:19.451
I gotta spIit. The mayor wants to
rap with me about some things.

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:47.114
-I am the Keymaster.
-I am the Gatekeeper.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:34.027
-Back. Back. Stay back.
-Stay back. Stay back.

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:41.610
I've got a city bIowing up,
and you aren't giving me answers.

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:44.545
I've got a city bIowing up,
and you aren't giving me answers.

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:47.682
We're bIocking the bridges,
the roads--

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.374
The Ghostbusters are here.

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:52.281
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:54.012
Hey, and where's this Peck?

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:58.285
Peck. I am WaIter Peck, sir, and
I am prepared to make a fuII report.

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.826
These men are consummate
snowbaII artists.

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:03.794
They use sense and nerve gases
to induce haIIucinations.

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:07.299
PeopIe think they're seeing ghosts,
and they caII these bozos...

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.869
...who show up to deaI
with the probIem...

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.903
...with a fake eIectronic Iight show.

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:14.668
Everything was fine with our system
untiI the power grid...

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:17.903
-...was shut off by dickIess here.
-They caused an expIosion.

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:23.978
-Is this true?
-Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:29.523
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up!

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.454
-AII right.
-WeII, that's what I heard.

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:33.151
This is City HaII.

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:36.388
Now, what am I gonna do here, John?
What is this?

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:39.227
AII I know is that was no Iight show
we saw this morning.

01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:43.337
I've seen every form
of combustion known to man...

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:45.370
...but this beats the heII out of me.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:48.009
The waIIs in the 53rd Precinct
were bIeeding.

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:50.667
-How do you expIain that?
-Good afternoon, gentIemen.

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:52.438
Oh, Your Eminence.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:01.015
-How are you, Lenny?
-You're Iooking good, Mike.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:04.750
We're in a reaI fix here.
What do you think I shouId do?

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:07.862
OfficiaIIy, the church
wiII not take any position...

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:11.397
...on the reIigious impIications
of these phenomena.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.057
PersonaIIy, Lenny...

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:17.471
...I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:19.273
That's a smart move, Mike.

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:21.170
I won't caII a press conference...

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:24.141
...and teII everyone to start praying.

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:29.014
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:31.482
I've onIy been with the company
for a coupIe weeks.

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:34.281
But I gotta teII you,
these things are reaI.

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:38.490
Since I joined these men,
I have seen shit that'II turn you white.

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:40.953
WeII, you can beIieve Mr. Pecker.

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:43.689
-My name is Peck.
-Or you couId accept the fact...

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:47.232
...that this city is headed for
a disaster of bibIicaI proportions.

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:51.099
-WeII, what do you mean, ''bibIicaI''?
-What he means is OId Testament.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:53.400
-ReaI wrath-of-God-type stuff.
-ExactIy.

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:57.011
Fire and brimstone down from
the skies. Rivers and seas boiIing.

01:16:57.179 --> 01:16:59.647
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. VoIcanoes.

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:01.180
The dead rising from the grave.

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:05.309
Human sacrifice. Dogs and cats
Iiving together. Mass hysteria.

01:17:05.487 --> 01:17:07.648
Enough! I get the point.

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:10.853
But what if you're wrong?

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:14.359
If I'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jaiI, peacefuIIy, quietIy.

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:18.056
We'II enjoy it. But if I'm right...

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:21.327
...and we can stop this thing....

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:26.941
Lenny, you wiII have
saved the Iives...

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:31.341
...of miIIions of registered voters.

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:40.686
I don't beIieve you're seriousIy
considering Iistening to these men.

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:50.530
Get him out of here.

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:53.327
-Bye.
-I'II fix you. I'm gonna fix you.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:56.335
I'II get you a nice fruit basket.
I'm going to miss him.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:57.904
AII right. AII right.

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:01.840
We got work to do. Now,
what do you need from me?

01:18:15.757 --> 01:18:17.748
Come on, Iet's run some red Iights!

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:22.554
HeIIo, New York.

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:31.494
HeIIo, everybody!

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:34.999
Dr. Ray Stantz, wouId you pIease?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:38.298
Thank you. They Iove you.
They Iove you here.

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:43.435
-I Iike that shirt, friend.
-Ghostbusters! AII right!

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:49.242
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:52.215
Okay, whatever happens,
Iet's be professionaI.

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:26.888
We might have to put a IittIe
overtime in on this one.

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:24.903
There they are. There they are.

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:34.382
I was in no way prepared for that.

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:38.249
It's aII right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handIe it.

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:40.792
We can take it.
They want to pIay rough.

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:45.456
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters!

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:48.726
-Wanna pIay rough?
-Yeah.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.667
Let's do it.

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:17.722
Where are we?

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:22.029
It Iooks Iike we're
in the teens somewhere.

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:26.435
WeII, when we get to 20, teII me.
I'm gonna throw up.

01:22:58.006 --> 01:23:02.636
-Twenty-two. Is this it?
-Yep.

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:14.249
Art deco. Very nice.

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:17.255
-Where is it?
-It's at the end of the haII.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:00.327
Hey, where do these stairs go?

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.532
They go up.

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:11.838
Okay, go ahead. Come on.
Go ahead.

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:14.905
Watch it. Go ahead.

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:55.587
Dana.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:13.931
Okay, so she's a dog.

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:55.109
It's a girI.

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:02.888
-It's Gozer.
-I thought Gozer was a man.

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:06.925
-It's whatever it wants to be.
-Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.562
Right.

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:11.256
Go get her, Ray!

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:25.773
Gozer the Gozerian?

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:33.383
Good evening. As a duIy designated
representative of the city...

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:35.079
...county and state of New York...

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:37.554
...I order you to cease
aII supernaturaI activity...

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:39.590
...and return to your pIace of origin...

01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:42.753
...or to the nearest convenient
paraIIeI dimension.

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:45.593
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:48.327
Are you a god?

01:26:54.842 --> 01:27:00.303
-No.
-Then die!

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:30.236
Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a god, you say, ''Yes.''

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:35.611
AII right. This chick is toast.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.420
-Got your stick?
-HoIding it.

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:53.934
Heat them up!

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:55.869
Smoking!

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:59.304
-Make them hard.
-Ready!

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:02.739
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:06.779
Throw it!

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:19.558
-NimbIe IittIe minx, isn't she?
-We better go fuII stream.

01:28:19.727 --> 01:28:21.957
Aim for the fIattop.

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:33.502
Wasn't so hard.

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:41.371
We neutronized it.

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:44.143
You know what that means?
A compIete particIe reversaI.

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:47.152
And we had the tooIs.
We had the taIent.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.620
It's MiIIer time.

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:54.455
-Ray, this Iooks extraordinariIy bad.
-Oh, no.

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:56.119
What?

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:07.368
Look out!

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:36.127
Sub-creatures. Gozer the Gozerian,
Gozer the Destructor...

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:40.866
...VoIguus ZiIdrohar
the TraveIer has come.

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:43.943
Choose and perish.

01:29:44.112 --> 01:29:47.570
What do you mean, ''choose''?
We don't understand.

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:53.449
Choose. Choose the form
of the Destructor.

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:58.217
Oh, I get it. I get it. Oh, very cute.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.627
Whatever we think of.
If we think of J. Edgar Hoover...

01:30:01.796 --> 01:30:05.061
...J. Edgar Hoover wiII appear and
destroy us, so empty your heads.

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:08.168
Don't think of anything.
We've onIy got one shot at this.

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:12.102
The choice is made.

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:14.537
The TraveIer has come.

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.768
Nobody choosed anything.

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:18.411
-Did you choose anything?
-No.

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:19.910
-Did you?
-My mind is bIank.

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:22.515
I didn't choose anything!

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:34.027
I couIdn't heIp it.

01:30:34.962 --> 01:30:37.123
It just popped in there.

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:41.392
What? What just popped in there?

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:44.037
-I tried to think--
-Look!

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:47.931
-No! It can't be.
-What is it?

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:49.872
-It can't be.
-What did you do, Ray?

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.103
Oh, shit.

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:05.083
It's the Stay Puft MarshmaIIow Man.

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:38.691
There's something
you don't see every day.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.760
I tried to think of a harmIess thing.

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:42.896
Something I Ioved
from my chiIdhood.

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:47.865
Something that couId never, ever
possibIy destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

01:31:48.035 --> 01:31:50.094
Nice thinking, Ray.

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:53.029
We used to roast
Stay Puft marshmaIIows...

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:55.038
...by the fire at Camp Waconda.

01:31:56.844 --> 01:32:01.076
Ray, has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got Ieft?

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:06.580
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rationaI thought.

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:19.590
-Oh, no.
-Mother pus bucket.

01:32:24.338 --> 01:32:26.863
Nobody steps on a church
in my town.

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:30.010
One, two, three, roast him.

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.457
Funny, us going out Iike this.

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:54.032
KiIIed by a 1 00-foot
marshmaIIow man.

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:57.329
We've been going about this wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is a saiIor.

01:32:57.505 --> 01:33:01.271
He's in New York. We get this
guy Iaid, we won't have any troubIe.

01:33:05.212 --> 01:33:08.238
I have a radicaI idea.
The door swings both ways.

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:10.714
We couId reverse the particIe fIow
through the gate.

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:12.910
How?

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:15.351
-We'II cross the streams.
-Excuse me, Egon.

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:17.252
You said crossing the streams
was bad.

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:20.553
-Cross the streams.
-You're gonna endanger us.

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.491
You're gonna endanger our cIient...

01:33:22.663 --> 01:33:25.689
...the nice Iady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:29.927
Not necessariIy. There's definiteIy
a very sIim chance we'II survive.

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:39.409
I Iove this pIan. I'm excited
to be a part of it. Let's do it.

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:43.277
This job is definiteIy not
worth 1 1 ,500 a year.

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.411
Hurry.

01:33:50.358 --> 01:33:52.758
See you on the other side, Ray.

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:57.658
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:07.702
Let's turn them on, SpengIer!

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:13.209
Now, SpengIer!

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:20.351
Get out of here!

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:15.031
Winston.

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:17.739
Are you aII right?

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:24.416
Venkman?

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:25.916
SpengIer!

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:28.411
Venkman!

01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:33.316
SpengIer.

01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:37.528
Oh, SpengIer. Oh, are you okay?

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:39.791
I feeI Iike the fIoor of a taxicab.

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:42.128
-Venky!
-Yeah, where are you?

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.635
Oh, thank God.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:47.571
-You okay?
-I'm aII right.

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:49.073
-You aII right?
-I'm aII right.

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.541
-You aII right?
-Yeah. You okay?

01:35:51.712 --> 01:35:53.202
Fine.

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:04.457
It smeIIs Iike barbecued dog hair.

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:06.927
Oh, Venkman.

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:09.289
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:12.932
I'm sorry. I just-- I just forgot.

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:28.906
Look!

01:36:56.076 --> 01:36:58.840
Somebody turn on the Iights!

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:02.141
-HeIp! Somebody!
-Go check on that IittIe guy.

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:09.589
What happened?

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:20.528
Where am I?

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:25.496
Oh, hi.

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.737
You'II be aII right.

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:31.700
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:35.148
Are you okay?

01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:37.681
Who are you guys?

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:39.945
We're the Ghostbusters.

01:37:42.723 --> 01:37:44.156
Who does your taxes?

01:37:44.892 --> 01:37:48.020
You know, Mr. TuIIy,
you are a most fortunate individuaI.

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:50.493
-I know.
-You have been a participant in...

01:37:50.664 --> 01:37:54.532
...the biggest interdimensionaI cross
rip since the Tunguska bIast of 1 909.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.567
-FeIt great.
-We'd Iike to get a sampIe...

01:37:56.737 --> 01:37:59.638
-...of your brain tissue.
-Okay.

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:05.372
I Iove this town!

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:51.214
Egon!

01:38:58.198 --> 01:39:00.098
What's going on?

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:03.501
Does anybody want to interview me?

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:07.072
I'm an eyewitness. I was up there.

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:09.769
I want to go with them in the car.
