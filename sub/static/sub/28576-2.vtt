Previously on Harrow...

00:01.819 --> 00:03.700
Welcome the new member
of the Cliffham staff,

00:03.740 --> 00:04.740
Dr Grace Molyneux.

00:04.780 --> 00:05.939
Hello, Grace.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.850
You're Fairley's girlfriend?!

00:07.890 --> 00:09.170
He's my uncle.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.380
Why aren't you in hospital?

00:10.420 --> 00:12.340
I thought I'd look over
some old case files

00:12.380 --> 00:14.020
to see who might have an axe to grind.

00:14.060 --> 00:15.550
There are thousands.

00:15.590 --> 00:16.630
And I shot him.

00:16.940 --> 00:18.860
- Shot who?
- Daniel Harrow.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.100
Mr Lincoln roses.

00:21.140 --> 00:22.640
Did you like my flowers?

00:22.680 --> 00:23.680
Who is this?

00:23.720 --> 00:25.580
This is the man who left those red roses

00:25.620 --> 00:27.770
because I'm the one who shot you.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.410
The man who shot me has been arrested.

00:30.450 --> 00:32.729
And has perished in Her Majesty's care.

00:33.140 --> 00:35.800
I'm glad I didn't kill
you with my first shot.

00:35.950 --> 00:39.640
Now I will take away
everything that you hold dear.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.880
Everything that makes
your life worth living.

Sync & corrections by emeline-whovian

02:07.230 --> 02:09.449
Well, that went better than I expected.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.860
Were we in the same courtroom?
She's going to trial.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.230
Your daughter was caught

02:14.270 --> 02:18.400
with $20,000 worth of stolen
pharmaceuticals in her flat.

02:19.260 --> 02:21.980
We were lucky the magistrate
met with our submission.

02:22.020 --> 02:23.680
That I have to live with Mum or Dad.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.870
Otherwise you wouldn't
have been granted bail.

02:26.150 --> 02:27.230
So...

02:27.430 --> 02:28.600
who's it going to be?

02:30.390 --> 02:33.030
- I think you should stay with your mum.
- You should stay with me.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.956
Well, what if I wanted to stay with you?

02:36.980 --> 02:39.480
I think you'd be more
comfortable at your mother's.

02:40.540 --> 02:42.500
Is this because of the shooting?

02:42.810 --> 02:44.940
Dad, they caught the guy, right?
He's dead.

02:47.730 --> 02:48.760
Yep.

02:49.180 --> 02:50.830
Well, that's fine, I'll stay with Mum.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.940
Good, I'll let the magistrate know.

02:53.090 --> 02:57.540
So, in the meantime,
stick to your bail conditions.

02:57.580 --> 02:58.810
Find yourself a job.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.360
Stay out of trouble.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.040
This is bullshit, I had nothing
to do with any of this.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.740
- Did Callan?
- Mum...

03:10.980 --> 03:12.730
Protecting him won't help you.

03:12.780 --> 03:14.060
Can we go, please?

03:16.200 --> 03:17.280
Fern?

03:18.940 --> 03:20.690
We will make this right.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.620
Do you think she'll be
OK staying at yours?

03:29.920 --> 03:31.340
She's going to have to be.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.140
Fish!

03:39.370 --> 03:41.620
What happened, hey?
What... what they say?

03:41.970 --> 03:43.260
Cal, they think I did it,

03:43.300 --> 03:44.930
and that I won't be seeing you anymore.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.420
What? Why?

03:46.460 --> 03:47.940
Because you've got a criminal record.

03:47.980 --> 03:50.180
If the cops see you and Fern together

03:50.220 --> 03:52.276
she'll be arrested for breaching
her bail conditions, OK?

03:52.300 --> 03:53.456
But you didn't do anything wrong.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.400
- They weren't her drugs.
- Were they yours?

03:55.780 --> 03:56.840
No.

03:57.860 --> 03:58.890
No!

03:59.380 --> 04:01.620
- I... I wouldn't do that to you!
- We have to go... now.

04:01.660 --> 04:02.996
You know I wouldn't do that to you.

04:03.020 --> 04:04.260
- Fish!
- Callan...

04:05.370 --> 04:06.890
You have to stay away from her.

04:11.220 --> 04:12.460
Are you telling the truth?

04:12.500 --> 04:13.510
Seriously?

04:14.590 --> 04:16.269
You have no idea, do you?

04:26.340 --> 04:27.620
Who tipped you off?

04:28.170 --> 04:30.156
Fern said you knew exactly
what you were looking for

04:30.180 --> 04:31.490
when you raided her flat.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.380
Someone told you the
fentanyl was there. Who?

04:34.420 --> 04:35.720
You know I can't tell you.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.456
I know what you think about Fern,
but she's not a criminal.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.020
And she's not the doe-eyed innocent
you think she is either.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.750
We both know she has form.

04:42.790 --> 04:45.390
She has never been charged
with drug offences.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.620
So, what do you think happened, Daniel?

04:47.660 --> 04:51.340
Someone just walked into her flat
and put $20,000 worth of fentanyl

04:51.380 --> 04:52.830
in her bag for safekeeping?

04:53.620 --> 04:55.420
She was working as a cleaner
at the chemist

04:55.460 --> 04:56.756
where the fentanyl was stolen from.

04:56.780 --> 04:59.500
She was on the premises the same day
the drugs went missing.

04:59.710 --> 05:00.740
She had keys.

05:00.780 --> 05:02.460
She had access to the security system,

05:02.500 --> 05:03.956
and she knew where the drugs were kept.

05:03.980 --> 05:05.980
Purely circumstantial,
that proves nothing.

05:06.020 --> 05:07.740
I also had Scientific check the bag,

05:07.780 --> 05:09.300
Fern's fingerprints are all over it.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.180
Well, of course they are, it's her bag.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.340
She's not denying that.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.660
No other prints, Dan, only hers.

05:16.670 --> 05:20.080
Your daughter broke the law
and she's going to have to pay.

05:29.660 --> 05:30.720
Harrow.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.160
How's Jill McCloud?

05:41.180 --> 05:42.700
Heart-warming as ever.

05:44.340 --> 05:45.420
And your daughter?

05:46.460 --> 05:47.760
Not guilty.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.910
Every parent wants to believe
their child is innocent.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.140
I know how it sounds,

05:52.180 --> 05:54.446
but I'm not convinced it's as
straightforward as Jill thinks.

05:54.470 --> 05:55.470
What do you mean?

05:58.780 --> 06:01.860
I, got a call late last night.

06:02.210 --> 06:04.260
It was a man's voice.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.340
He said he was the person who shot me.

06:06.710 --> 06:09.260
He told me that he was glad I didn't die

06:09.300 --> 06:12.480
because now he wants to destroy
everything I care about.

06:12.850 --> 06:16.310
And right after that, I got the call
that Fern had been arrested.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.180
You know Skene confessed to
the shooting? He had the gun.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.540
- I know.
- And now he's in your morgue.

06:23.580 --> 06:24.540
I know.

06:24.580 --> 06:26.780
And you were all over the news
for a while there.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.420
This wasn't a prank call.

06:28.460 --> 06:30.180
This guy knew things.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.210
He wants to make me suffer.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.800
- Caller ID?
- No.

06:39.220 --> 06:40.430
Look, Harrow...

06:41.860 --> 06:43.380
I know you've been through a lot,

06:43.420 --> 06:45.460
and this stuff with Fern
can't be helping,

06:45.500 --> 06:47.620
but just think about what
you're suggesting here.

06:48.220 --> 06:49.940
That Skeme was a patsy?

06:50.370 --> 06:52.900
Someone set him up,
and that same someone

06:52.940 --> 06:55.820
put stolen drugs in your daughter's
flat all to get back at you?

06:55.860 --> 06:57.910
I know. It sounds crazy.

06:59.980 --> 07:02.100
OK, listen, we'll take it seriously.

07:02.140 --> 07:04.480
We're still monitoring your phone
so I'll look into it.

07:04.690 --> 07:05.690
OK?

07:06.810 --> 07:07.960
Alright.

07:08.310 --> 07:10.590
Come on, otherwise young Simon
will do you out of a job.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.600
You know, he's becoming
a bigger pain in the arse than you.

07:18.780 --> 07:19.940
Base jumpers.

07:19.980 --> 07:22.220
Yep, broke into the building
early this morning

07:22.260 --> 07:24.940
to access the roof for a dawn jump
and now look at them.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.370
I mean, this is why
base jumping is illegal.

07:28.260 --> 07:29.300
Any witnesses?

07:29.340 --> 07:31.480
Well, I mean,
the guy whose car they hit.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.200
Ray Gupta.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.330
He stops in for a coffee
and this happens.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.350
- And that's a nice start to the day.
- Did he see anything?

07:39.470 --> 07:42.250
- Well, nothing useful.
- Have you ID'd the bodies?

07:43.660 --> 07:47.020
Luca Fandino and Tomas Fuentes.

07:47.060 --> 07:48.620
Spanish nationals and,

07:48.660 --> 07:50.740
and well-known
YouTube stars, apparently.

07:50.780 --> 07:51.956
What was the name of their channel?

07:51.980 --> 07:53.420
Live Life Now.

07:53.670 --> 07:54.820
Live Life Now.

07:54.860 --> 07:57.240
Fly around the world
filming these crazy stunts.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.340
They had two million followers.

07:59.380 --> 08:01.410
His chute is still in its pack.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.610
Who goes base jumping
and doesn't pull their chute?

08:04.650 --> 08:07.160
Well, Tomas pulled his,
it was fully deployed.

08:07.190 --> 08:08.860
He still hit the ground pretty hard.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.380
Maybe he pulled it too late.

08:10.420 --> 08:12.890
Or the chutes were faulty.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.980
I'll get Scientific to check them,
but I think at the moment

08:16.020 --> 08:18.140
we're looking at death by misadventure.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.450
No cameras.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.460
Tomas wasn't wearing one,

08:25.500 --> 08:27.540
but Luka had a GoPro
mounted to his helmet.

08:27.580 --> 08:29.100
We're still accessing the footage.

08:30.780 --> 08:32.340
And wife filmed some of it.

08:34.260 --> 08:36.299
Anna Mechaud, Canadian.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.919
Was she going to jump too?

08:42.039 --> 08:43.200
I couldn't.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.720
How could I?

08:45.930 --> 08:48.500
And I realised what happened.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.490
I couldn't bring myself to jump,

08:53.170 --> 08:55.020
so I ran back downstairs.

08:56.420 --> 08:58.580
Luca's done this hundreds of times.

08:58.620 --> 08:59.820
So has Tomas.

08:59.860 --> 09:03.030
But for both of them to die,
it doesn't make any sense.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.220
- Did your husband pack his own chute?
- Yes.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.220
- And Tomas?
- Yes, we always pack our own chutes.

09:10.260 --> 09:12.020
Could anyone have tampered with them?

09:12.590 --> 09:14.870
No, we never let them
out of our sight before a jump.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.720
I hadn't even been married for a year.

09:21.330 --> 09:22.770
This shouldn't have happened.

09:24.340 --> 09:28.660
What are the odds that two parachutes
failed during the same jump?

09:28.700 --> 09:29.820
I don't know.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.340
But those guys were pros.

09:33.450 --> 09:35.090
Maybe they were just unlucky.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.440
I...

09:50.780 --> 09:53.620
I know how hard this must be
for you, to come back here.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.810
Do you believe me?

09:55.320 --> 09:56.890
About the drugs.

10:00.670 --> 10:02.540
If you say you didn't do it then...

10:02.880 --> 10:04.850
yes, I believe you.

10:08.790 --> 10:10.760
I'm sorry you had to go
through all this.

10:11.700 --> 10:12.860
No...

10:12.900 --> 10:14.740
I'm the one that should be sorry.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.740
I like what you've
done with the place.

11:05.780 --> 11:08.540
Not quite as OCD as Fairley's,
but borderline.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.540
He did give me this
to warm the place up with.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.500
Said I might need it to disembowel
nosy work colleagues.

11:16.870 --> 11:18.500
They can be terrible around here.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.700
So, is this smaller than your office
at Royal North Shore?

11:24.200 --> 11:25.900
It's rude to google people.

11:25.940 --> 11:28.940
Just curious about my
new work colleague.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.160
So, why did you leave neurosurgery?

11:34.300 --> 11:37.820
Aside from the charms of joining
the great unwashed in pathology.

11:38.250 --> 11:39.980
It was time for a career change.

11:40.020 --> 11:41.580
Can I help you with something?

11:44.500 --> 11:46.660
Why didn't you come
to the accident scene this morning?

11:47.300 --> 11:48.980
If the police needed me
I would have come.

11:49.020 --> 11:52.550
But I have the reports, the photos,
everything I need, right here.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.700
Sometimes there's more to learn
than just what's in the report.

12:06.980 --> 12:10.030
How does it feel to live life
in the moment?

12:10.310 --> 12:12.740
In the present, in the now?

12:12.780 --> 12:15.510
To do what you want to do every second,

12:15.550 --> 12:17.470
every minute, every day.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.660
Life isn't a prison.

12:19.690 --> 12:21.900
You can choose to be free.

12:21.940 --> 12:22.980
It's up to you.

12:23.350 --> 12:26.110
- Just take the leap.
- Yee-ha!

12:26.230 --> 12:30.140
Live your life,
live it free, live it now.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.020
I'm surprised it's taken them
this long to come to grief.

12:39.270 --> 12:41.120
Are you saying you don't take risks?

12:41.540 --> 12:42.740
The last time I did,

12:42.780 --> 12:44.570
I discovered the guy lived on a boat...

12:45.010 --> 12:46.050
at anchor.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.680
Not a good prospect.

12:51.620 --> 12:53.150
Don't you think it's strange?

12:53.340 --> 12:56.580
They had done over 100 jumps each,

12:56.620 --> 12:58.780
but one pulls his pilot chute too late,

12:58.820 --> 13:00.260
and the other doesn't pull at all.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.300
Pilot chute?

13:01.490 --> 13:04.980
Yes, base jumpers don't use rip cords.

13:05.020 --> 13:06.580
They have pilot chutes.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.436
It's a small parachute
they pull from their pack

13:08.460 --> 13:11.100
during freefall
that drags open the main chute.

13:11.140 --> 13:15.220
Now, the building they jumped from
was over 300 meters high,

13:15.260 --> 13:18.060
which would have given them
about four seconds of freefall

13:18.100 --> 13:19.770
before they had to pull their chutes.

13:19.810 --> 13:21.030
Plenty of time.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.680
But Luca's was still in his pack.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.240
Why?

13:25.810 --> 13:27.560
What stopped him from pulling?

13:29.110 --> 13:31.750
Maybe he had a cardiac arrest
when he jumped?

13:31.880 --> 13:33.580
An aneurysm stroke?

13:34.710 --> 13:37.340
That may explain one, but both?

13:38.380 --> 13:39.500
Sorry to interrupt.

13:39.990 --> 13:42.440
Spanish Embassy has given us
the OK for the autopsy.

13:42.470 --> 13:43.660
And Police Scientific?

13:43.700 --> 13:45.740
Checked both chutes.
Nothing wrong with them.

13:45.780 --> 13:47.420
They said they were both
packed correctly.

13:52.460 --> 13:53.660
Ooh, sorry.

13:56.660 --> 14:00.510
Well, cause of death won't
take too long to pinpoint.

14:02.140 --> 14:05.260
Why anyone would throw
themselves off a building

14:05.300 --> 14:08.660
expecting a flimsy piece of fabric
to save them is beyond me.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.460
You went skydiving
in New Zealand though.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.500
- You sent me that pic.
- Yeah. Yes!

14:13.540 --> 14:15.110
Well, that was completely different.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.740
It was a tandem jump.

14:16.930 --> 14:19.290
My instructor
had a lifetime's experience.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.420
Why was that different?

14:21.990 --> 14:24.340
Well, knowing there was a man behind me

14:24.380 --> 14:26.500
who was that skilled made my first time

14:26.540 --> 14:28.960
feel very... safe...

14:29.460 --> 14:30.780
and very satisfying.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.680
Quite transformative really.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.460
Right. Shall we get started?

14:41.660 --> 14:45.400
Multiple and severe fractures
to his neck,

14:45.820 --> 14:50.730
spine, and limbs,
as well as deep skin lacerations.

14:51.460 --> 14:52.590
Fluids are done.

14:52.940 --> 14:54.540
I'll order a full tox.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.500
If he had any drugs or alcohol
in his system,

14:56.540 --> 14:58.420
it might explain
why he didn't pull his chute.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.820
Hello.

15:01.140 --> 15:02.540
This is interesting.

15:02.580 --> 15:04.020
Yes?

15:04.060 --> 15:07.100
I was just about to
complete the external

15:07.140 --> 15:08.560
and I saw this.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.500
Skin lacerations.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.080
Both bodies are covered in them.

15:12.420 --> 15:16.140
Yes, but this one isn't consistent
with impact injury.

15:16.180 --> 15:19.100
- This one looks more like...
- A rope burn.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.450
Friction abrasions, yes.

15:22.620 --> 15:23.910
But from what?

15:24.400 --> 15:27.300
Well, perhaps he was trying
to untangle his suspension line

15:27.340 --> 15:28.580
before he hit the ground.

15:28.620 --> 15:32.820
But at the accident scene
his suspension lines weren't tangled.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.820
Let's check the wound for fibres.

15:37.580 --> 15:38.740
Shall we start internals?

15:38.780 --> 15:39.840
Yes.

15:46.660 --> 15:47.940
What do you make of this?

15:49.510 --> 15:51.030
Dislocated vertebra?

15:51.860 --> 15:53.570
No, it's too soft.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.580
It looks like... a cyst.

16:04.420 --> 16:05.540
Yes.

16:09.340 --> 16:11.780
This is no ordinary cyst.

16:13.900 --> 16:17.080
That is a larval cyst.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.500
A larval cyst...

16:22.900 --> 16:24.540
of a tapeworm.

16:27.260 --> 16:30.300
If the cyst was pressing
on Luca's spinal cord

16:30.340 --> 16:32.060
it could have affected
his motor functions.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.500
It's a possibility.

16:33.780 --> 16:35.276
Parasitic infections are known to cause

16:35.300 --> 16:38.180
nervous system disorders
like seizures, blindness,

16:38.220 --> 16:39.670
weakness in legs and hands.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.660
Enough to stop him
from pulling his chute?

16:42.700 --> 16:44.980
The million dollar question.

16:46.060 --> 16:47.900
You want to get this little guy
off to the lab.

16:48.900 --> 16:52.140
Er, Grace, are you heading out
tonight or will you be staying in?

16:52.180 --> 16:54.140
I'm staying in tonight.

16:54.290 --> 16:56.700
- That OK?
- Great. Lovely. Fine.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.460
That's every night this week.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.460
- Sorry?
- Grace.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.700
I said she could stay at mine
until she finds a place.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.020
But?

17:10.060 --> 17:13.200
Well, now she's put a bit of a pin
in the old love-life.

17:13.339 --> 17:14.780
You know how it is, Harrow.

17:14.819 --> 17:15.819
You head out,

17:15.859 --> 17:17.579
you meet a single lady,

17:17.859 --> 17:19.900
a couple of Singapore Slings later

17:19.940 --> 17:21.836
you invite her back
to your apartment for a bit of...

17:21.859 --> 17:22.859
Please stop.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.859
No, exactly the opposite.

17:25.380 --> 17:30.160
But I don't feel comfortable doing
that with my niece in the next room.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.900
The walls in my apartment
are paper thin.

17:33.410 --> 17:35.440
- They're shoji screens.
- Exactly.

17:35.940 --> 17:40.530
And I don't want Grace to think I'm
some sort of insatiable lothario.

17:41.380 --> 17:43.700
But a man has urges, Harrow.

17:43.850 --> 17:46.060
Urges he cannot deny.

17:46.420 --> 17:49.260
The sooner she's out
from under my feet, the better.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.180
So...

18:01.910 --> 18:03.540
when did you sleep with Grace?

18:04.060 --> 18:05.970
What makes you think
I've slept with Grace?!

18:11.540 --> 18:13.500
The night before she started.

18:13.540 --> 18:14.710
And for the record,

18:14.740 --> 18:18.260
I didn't know she was working here,
or that I was her supervisor,

18:18.300 --> 18:20.150
or that she was Fairley's niece.

18:20.190 --> 18:21.750
Jeez, triple whammy.

18:22.510 --> 18:23.720
Is it serious?

18:24.290 --> 18:26.810
We decided to keep things
strictly professional.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.500
Yeah, good luck with that.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.860
Haven't you got something to sterilise?

18:56.310 --> 18:57.590
Sorry.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.440
_

19:26.260 --> 19:27.940
Hey, how's Fern?

19:28.260 --> 19:29.940
Have you spoken to her?

19:30.940 --> 19:33.270
Not since we left court.
Is everything OK?

19:33.580 --> 19:34.820
She's not here.

19:34.860 --> 19:36.690
She hasn't been here all afternoon.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.340
And she stripped out her room.

19:39.570 --> 19:40.980
I'm worried, Daniel.

19:41.020 --> 19:42.100
Have you called her?

19:42.140 --> 19:44.380
No! That never occurred to me.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.260
Of course I have. She's not answering.

19:46.630 --> 19:48.100
Dan, what if she's with Callen?

19:48.140 --> 19:51.260
- If they're caught together...
- Let me call her, OK?

19:51.960 --> 19:53.020
Yeah.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.140
Hi.

20:03.640 --> 20:04.760
Hi, Bum.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.060
Where are you?

20:06.380 --> 20:08.990
Doing what my lawyer said,
looking for a job.

20:09.780 --> 20:11.020
Are you checking up on me?

20:12.100 --> 20:14.660
I... got a call from your mum.

20:14.700 --> 20:15.950
She's worried about you.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.760
So am I.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.670
Why didn't you want me to stay
in the Betty with you?

20:23.020 --> 20:25.740
Look, I told you.

20:25.780 --> 20:28.060
Yeah, but I'm not an idiot, Dad.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.730
What's the real reason?

20:31.540 --> 20:32.620
I don't know yet.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.380
What's that mean?

20:34.940 --> 20:36.250
What's going on?

20:37.310 --> 20:38.310
Dad?

20:39.820 --> 20:41.360
Look, it's complicated.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.950
Worm results are in.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.740
Look, I've got to go.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.380
Talk soon, OK?

20:57.100 --> 21:00.640
_

21:01.820 --> 21:03.100
So, how'd you go?

21:04.680 --> 21:05.800
I'm sorry.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.220
You were right.

21:12.420 --> 21:15.100
Taenia solium, lava of a pork tapeworm.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.340
I thought tapeworms
lived in the intestines.

21:17.380 --> 21:18.380
They do.

21:18.420 --> 21:20.580
So, how did this one
end up in his spine?

21:20.720 --> 21:24.060
Because Luca was infected
by a human, not a pig.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.280
We all know that Luca was travelling
around the world, right?

21:28.320 --> 21:31.080
So, let's say he ate something
from a street vendor

21:31.120 --> 21:32.910
who had a tapeworm in his intestine,

21:33.260 --> 21:35.860
and through poor hygiene
was contaminating

21:35.900 --> 21:38.140
the food he was preparing
with his own faeces.

21:38.180 --> 21:39.140
Nice.

21:39.180 --> 21:41.420
Well, when the eggs hatch,

21:41.460 --> 21:43.540
the larvae thinks it's inside a pig

21:43.580 --> 21:45.020
so it enters into the bloodstream

21:45.060 --> 21:46.380
and ends up in the brain, eyes,

21:46.420 --> 21:47.540
liver, and the spine.

21:47.580 --> 21:48.900
So, it took a wrong turn?

21:48.940 --> 21:50.500
In a manner of speaking, yes.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.140
And as the larva grows,

21:52.180 --> 21:55.860
it can block the flow
of cerebrospinal fluid to the brain.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.940
Did the helminthologist
say how long it was there?

21:59.970 --> 22:03.180
Based on life cycle,
infection occurred two months ago.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.460
There are only three species
of tapeworm that can infect humans,

22:08.500 --> 22:12.580
and taenia solium can be found
only in Latin America.

22:12.620 --> 22:14.820
- Did Luca travel there recently?
- Yes.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.660
Yeah, I saw a video on their feed.

22:18.860 --> 22:20.540
Look, Argentina a month ago.

22:20.580 --> 22:23.060
They shot this just before they left.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.540
- Hey, guapo, are you ready to fly?
- I'm always...

22:25.580 --> 22:28.340
Well, that explains where
he picked up the tapeworm,

22:28.760 --> 22:30.940
but we still don't know
if it was causing problems

22:30.980 --> 22:32.340
with his motor functions.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.320
We do now.

22:36.450 --> 22:37.500
Hey, Anna...

22:37.540 --> 22:38.660
He can't grip properly.

22:38.700 --> 22:39.940
Get him to move his ass.

22:39.980 --> 22:41.540
Move that sexy ass!

22:41.750 --> 22:44.340
And look, his pilot chute
is packed on the left.

22:44.380 --> 22:46.636
Well, it makes sense. If you're
having trouble with your right hand

22:46.660 --> 22:48.820
it'd be easer to grab on the left side.

22:49.270 --> 22:50.900
Yes, but look.

22:50.940 --> 22:52.120
Right now.

22:53.180 --> 22:55.500
If Luka was having trouble
with his right hand,

22:55.620 --> 22:58.680
why did he pack his pilot chute
on the right this morning?

23:03.200 --> 23:04.360
A tapeworm?

23:04.500 --> 23:06.820
Pressing on his spinal cord.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.580
I think it may have been
causing problems with his hands.

23:12.590 --> 23:13.620
Yeah, well...

23:14.020 --> 23:15.490
that'd explain a few things.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.240
OK...

23:18.420 --> 23:20.460
This is what
we pulled from Luca's camera.

23:20.920 --> 23:25.540
OK, three, two, one... Espera, para!

23:34.020 --> 23:35.180
He failed to pull his chute.

23:35.220 --> 23:37.460
Yeah, like you said. The tapeworm.

23:37.970 --> 23:41.610
OK, and this is the footage
the wife shot from the rooftop.

23:44.740 --> 23:46.340
OK, I'll go first.

23:46.380 --> 23:48.740
- See you down there, man.
- Go for it, babe!

23:50.780 --> 23:54.660
OK, three, two, one... Espera, para!

23:58.100 --> 23:59.460
Luca!

23:59.710 --> 24:01.380
Tomas jumped after him.

24:01.420 --> 24:03.820
So, maybe he tried to
grab Luca in midair,

24:04.210 --> 24:06.010
and tried to use his own chute
to save him.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.620
Fairley did find
an unusual cut on his hand.

24:10.260 --> 24:13.380
Tomas said something in Spanish
when Luca jumped.

24:13.420 --> 24:14.420
I couldn't make it out.

24:14.460 --> 24:16.260
- Can we turn up the volume?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.570
- See you down there, man.
- Go for it, babe!

24:19.300 --> 24:23.460
OK, three, two, one... Espera, para!

24:24.580 --> 24:26.060
'Espera, para...'

24:26.510 --> 24:28.000
It means, "Wait, stop."

24:29.120 --> 24:30.680
Tomas was trying to warn him.

24:31.540 --> 24:34.020
He knew Luca's chute was
packed on the wrong side

24:34.060 --> 24:37.540
which means he knew
about Luka's dodgy hand.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.000
Did his wife know, too?

24:41.960 --> 24:43.400
I had no idea.

24:45.540 --> 24:47.460
But Tomas seemed to know.

24:49.060 --> 24:51.400
If I didn't know about the
tapeworm, how could he?

24:52.840 --> 24:54.440
Luca was right-handed.

24:55.580 --> 24:57.280
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

24:57.940 --> 25:00.210
And he always packed his
pilot chute on the right?

25:00.250 --> 25:04.060
Yes, but he'd been complaining
about a sore shoulder

25:04.100 --> 25:05.460
when we were in Argentina,

25:05.500 --> 25:07.820
so he started packing it on the left.

25:08.800 --> 25:12.300
But this morning on the roof,
it was packed on the right.

25:13.940 --> 25:15.860
And you're certain Luca
packed his own chute?

25:16.160 --> 25:17.320
Of course.

25:18.780 --> 25:20.070
I don't get it.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.160
If Luca was having problems,
why didn't he tell me?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.020
What?

25:28.860 --> 25:31.660
Why would Tomas know
about Luca's hand problem,

25:31.700 --> 25:32.860
but not his wife?

25:34.180 --> 25:35.420
Jesus, Harrow.

25:35.460 --> 25:37.700
I could give you a list
a mile long of the things

25:37.740 --> 25:39.210
I didn't tell my ex-wife.

25:39.860 --> 25:41.180
Who's the ex?

25:41.900 --> 25:43.420
Look, what does it matter anyway?

25:43.460 --> 25:45.780
You found your culprit.
It's a bloody tapeworm.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.740
OK, Anna Mechaud is leaving
the country tomorrow night

25:49.780 --> 25:51.660
and she wants to take
the bodies with her.

25:51.930 --> 25:54.410
Unless you have a good reason to stall.

25:57.980 --> 25:58.980
No...

25:59.020 --> 26:00.580
Well, then I'll close the case, Dan.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.100
And, Harrow...

26:07.780 --> 26:08.860
That call you got?

26:08.900 --> 26:10.740
I talked to the tech team about it.

26:10.780 --> 26:12.660
You didn't mention it
was one of those,

26:12.700 --> 26:14.550
internet messaging apps.

26:14.750 --> 26:16.100
Why is that a problem?

26:16.140 --> 26:17.580
Well, those apps are encrypted.

26:17.620 --> 26:18.900
They're untraceable,

26:18.940 --> 26:21.660
so there's no way
we can identify that number.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.100
So what am I supposed
to do if he calls again?

26:24.140 --> 26:25.540
You don't pick up.

26:25.900 --> 26:28.220
Like I said, it's probably
just a nuisance caller.

26:30.100 --> 26:31.380
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.940
- Dan.
- Paul, hi.

26:41.980 --> 26:44.940
- Summer cold?
- No, it's just a flu I can't shake.

26:44.980 --> 26:48.500
Hey, erm, listen, I'm sorry
to hear about your daughter.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.430
I hope the trial goes well.

26:51.260 --> 26:53.380
Wait, you're not prosecuting her?

26:53.420 --> 26:54.890
No, I recused myself.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.540
Of course.

26:57.580 --> 27:01.200
Listen, mate, I hope
you got yourself a good solicitor.

27:01.940 --> 27:03.170
Why?

27:03.800 --> 27:06.100
Fern's got no criminal record.

27:06.140 --> 27:08.020
She's never been in any trouble.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.916
At worst, we think it might be
a suspended sentence.

27:09.940 --> 27:10.900
Normally, yeah,

27:10.940 --> 27:14.900
but, Dan, this is a bad time
to be caught with fentanyl.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.780
The courts are making examples.

27:16.820 --> 27:20.780
Fern's looking at charges of theft,
possession, intent to sell...

27:20.820 --> 27:23.180
And she could go to jail
for seven years.

27:23.220 --> 27:25.860
Seven years? Paul, she didn't do it.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.386
I don't think it's going
to matter, mate.

27:27.410 --> 27:29.570
Unless you can prove someone else did.

27:32.020 --> 27:33.120
I'm sorry.

27:47.820 --> 27:48.820
Callen.

27:53.060 --> 27:55.060
I know what you and Steph are thinking,

27:55.100 --> 27:56.540
but I didn't steal those drugs.

27:57.780 --> 27:59.260
I would never do that to Fern.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.400
I believe you.

28:02.820 --> 28:03.980
Really?

28:05.700 --> 28:07.300
I know how much you love Fern.

28:08.950 --> 28:09.990
Yeah.

28:10.500 --> 28:11.500
I do.

28:17.860 --> 28:19.060
Callen...

28:21.070 --> 28:23.860
where are you staying
now that you've lost your flat?

28:36.220 --> 28:37.280
Here you go.

28:38.780 --> 28:40.030
I didn't know you could cook.

28:40.290 --> 28:42.410
I didn't know
you knew anything about me.

28:52.860 --> 28:53.980
It's delicious.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.120
It's Fern's favourite.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.716
Hey, thanks for letting me stay in,
you know...

29:03.740 --> 29:05.580
Stop thanking me. It's fine.

29:05.620 --> 29:06.580
It won't be for long.

29:06.620 --> 29:09.420
You know, just until I can find
my own place to crash.

29:09.460 --> 29:11.060
Yes, you've already said.

29:11.100 --> 29:13.580
Don't worry,
I'll make myself very useful.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.580
I'll, um... I'll cook.

29:16.240 --> 29:17.290
I'll tidy up.

29:17.330 --> 29:18.330
Well...

29:19.010 --> 29:20.770
no-one could tidy this place.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.740
But I won't get in your face.

29:24.780 --> 29:25.970
Promise.

29:26.540 --> 29:28.420
That was incredible.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.260
So, who are those guys?

29:33.300 --> 29:34.880
They're base jumpers.

29:35.830 --> 29:37.340
Did one of them die or something?

29:39.260 --> 29:41.500
Shit. Sorry.

29:43.540 --> 29:44.820
So, what are you looking for?

29:45.900 --> 29:47.780
This guy...

29:49.220 --> 29:51.100
had a problem with his right hand.

29:51.340 --> 29:53.780
So I'm trawling through
all these clips to find out

29:53.820 --> 29:55.980
when he started using his left.

29:58.500 --> 29:59.916
There's, like, a thousand clips in here.

29:59.940 --> 30:00.980
Yeah.

30:01.020 --> 30:03.540
Which is why I think
I might call it a night.

30:03.580 --> 30:04.900
But it's only nine o'clock.

30:04.940 --> 30:06.580
It's been a very long day.

30:19.060 --> 30:20.580
Don't drink my whisky.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.780
- Isn't this case closed?
- Yes.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.250
Want to give me a hand?

31:31.380 --> 31:32.740
You found something.

31:48.940 --> 31:51.390
He's having trouble with his
right hand, we know that.

31:51.430 --> 31:54.700
Yes, but this video was shot in Madrid

31:54.740 --> 31:56.820
one month before Luca went to Argentina,

31:56.850 --> 31:59.220
one month before the tapeworm infection.

31:59.260 --> 32:01.590
So the nerve damage to his spine...

32:01.630 --> 32:03.440
Wasn't caused by the tapeworm.

32:03.780 --> 32:05.700
Then what caused it?

32:05.880 --> 32:07.960
Hold that thought.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.620
Hola, Dr Resende.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.860
Si. I have the blood test you requested

32:13.900 --> 32:15.420
for my patient, Luca Fardino.

32:15.460 --> 32:16.420
Excellent.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.700
- Could you send them to me, please?
- Absolutely.

32:18.740 --> 32:22.340
And can you confirm his CPK levels?

32:22.380 --> 32:26.460
We found they were unusually high,
over 1,000 units per litre.

32:26.830 --> 32:29.940
I found the same thing when he came
to see me before he went travelling.

32:30.660 --> 32:34.580
We did some tests and found
that Luca was suffering from ALS.

32:35.130 --> 32:36.900
I think you'd call it...

32:36.940 --> 32:38.380
Motor neurone disease.

32:38.420 --> 32:39.490
Si.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.820
MND is an idiopathic
neurodegenerative disorder

32:46.860 --> 32:49.260
that selectively affects motor neurons.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.730
These control
the body's effector organs,

32:52.100 --> 32:56.310
which carry out the nervous
responses to external stimuli.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.880
Anna, MND is a horrible disease.

33:07.700 --> 33:08.900
It destroys the pathways

33:08.940 --> 33:12.190
that deliver messages from
the brain to the muscles.

33:13.220 --> 33:16.090
It starts with loss of muscle control.

33:16.840 --> 33:20.340
Then difficulties with breathing,
then paralysis, and death.

33:21.930 --> 33:24.940
It's the reason Luca was having
trouble with his right hand.

33:26.620 --> 33:27.780
So...

33:28.420 --> 33:29.940
his sore shoulder?

33:30.140 --> 33:32.980
It was just an excuse
to hide his symptoms.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.820
He never told you about his diagnosis?

33:38.920 --> 33:40.000
No.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.680
And I know why.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.280
Luca always said that...

33:56.660 --> 33:58.770
if he couldn't live the way we lived

33:59.140 --> 34:01.550
then he'd rather not live at all.

34:03.140 --> 34:04.770
Are you saying it was deliberate?

34:05.660 --> 34:07.580
I know my husband, Dr Harrow.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.940
To end up in a body
that was failing him.

34:12.310 --> 34:14.080
Needing constant care.

34:17.370 --> 34:18.840
He wouldn't have wanted that.

34:21.739 --> 34:24.260
He wouldn't have wanted me
to go through that.

34:37.380 --> 34:38.739
He spared us all.

34:51.739 --> 34:53.820
Maxine said you'd be up here...

34:54.500 --> 34:56.090
having a sneaky cigarette.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.170
I don't smoke anymore.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.200
Shame. I could do with a drag.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.700
This from a girl who doesn't take risks.

35:06.740 --> 35:09.300
For the record,
you said that, not me.

35:14.020 --> 35:17.060
You're not comfortable
dealing with patients, are you?

35:18.300 --> 35:20.060
We all have our own thing.

35:21.860 --> 35:23.980
So, what do you do up here
if you don't smoke?

35:25.460 --> 35:27.700
Think, breathe.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.630
Get away from your uncle.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.120
And you're thinking about Luca.

35:34.310 --> 35:35.870
You're not convinced, are you?

35:37.090 --> 35:41.460
If you were going to spare your wife
the suffering of watching you die,

35:41.500 --> 35:44.380
why would you jump off
a building in front of her?

35:44.790 --> 35:46.110
It doesn't make sense.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.400
Is that your gut talking?

35:50.060 --> 35:52.220
- Yeah.
- The one that's been shot?

35:55.940 --> 35:58.500
I've seen what motor neurone
disease does to people.

35:58.670 --> 36:00.900
I've seen patients live with it
and die with it.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.620
It's not just them who suffer.

36:03.660 --> 36:05.100
It's their families too.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.620
They're the ones
that have to nurse them to the end.

36:08.980 --> 36:11.460
And if you had the choice,
would you ever consider...?

36:11.500 --> 36:13.910
Yes. I would.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.780
Anyway, looks like you solved the case.

36:17.820 --> 36:19.060
Impressive.

36:19.660 --> 36:21.020
So I'll see you tomorrow.

36:42.780 --> 36:45.300
Dr Resende, soy Daniel Harrow.

36:45.340 --> 36:48.940
I got your email and saw
that Luca's wife, Anna Mechaud

36:48.980 --> 36:51.740
was listed as Luca's emergency contact.

36:51.780 --> 36:53.060
That's right.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.700
Did she know about his diagnosis?

36:54.740 --> 36:57.140
She was in the room
when I gave Luca the results.

36:57.180 --> 36:58.940
Of course she knew. Why?

37:00.380 --> 37:01.980
Because she said she didn't.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.820
You've called Bryan Nichols,

37:03.860 --> 37:04.820
please leave a message.

37:04.860 --> 37:08.180
Bryan, it's Harrow.
Anna Mechaud lied to us.

37:08.420 --> 37:09.780
Call me as soon as you can.

37:13.790 --> 37:16.650
_

37:18.420 --> 37:21.240
_

37:47.620 --> 37:49.660
This isn't a BMW.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.830
It says here you drive a BMW.

37:52.220 --> 37:53.620
It's at the shop.

37:53.660 --> 37:55.370
I had a little accident.

37:57.140 --> 37:58.440
Let me guess.

37:58.820 --> 38:00.500
You got hit by a base jumper.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.200
I know you're a fan, Ray.

38:06.820 --> 38:09.660
I know you drove them
to the building before they jumped.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.780
And I know you waited for them

38:11.820 --> 38:13.700
when Luca fell and hit your car.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.580
That's when you removed
the Sadel sticker from your BMW

38:18.050 --> 38:19.540
and lied to the police.

38:19.860 --> 38:22.380
And seeing as you didn't mention
your involvement,

38:22.420 --> 38:25.180
that makes you an accessory to a crime.

38:25.540 --> 38:26.700
What do you want?

38:26.740 --> 38:30.820
I want to see all the footage
you have of them from your dash cam.

38:36.540 --> 38:39.620
You're going to wait for us, right?
Drive us back to the hotel?

38:39.660 --> 38:41.300
Don't worry, I'll wait.

38:41.650 --> 38:43.340
This is the building.

38:43.910 --> 38:46.190
Tomas and I will try
the fire-escape. Take this.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.780
See you down there.

39:07.460 --> 39:08.820
That's all there is.

39:09.370 --> 39:10.440
Wait!

39:32.030 --> 39:33.030
Hi.

39:33.060 --> 39:34.860
It was Anna Mechaud!

39:34.900 --> 39:36.980
- What?!
- She swapped the chute.

39:37.020 --> 39:39.220
I've left a message for Nichols
but he's not picking up,

39:39.260 --> 39:40.420
I need you to find him.

39:40.460 --> 39:41.420
Where are you?

39:41.460 --> 39:42.580
I'm on my way to Anna.

39:42.620 --> 39:44.180
She's on the roof of the building.

39:44.220 --> 39:46.340
- Daniel...
- Tell Nichols to meet me there.

39:46.380 --> 39:47.740
No, this is not your job.

39:47.780 --> 39:49.220
Wait for the police.

39:51.980 --> 39:53.780
Harrow? Harrow?

39:58.540 --> 40:01.860
I know many of you have
been asking what will happen

40:01.900 --> 40:03.810
now that Luca and Tomas are gone.

40:04.540 --> 40:05.940
They started this channel,

40:05.980 --> 40:08.300
and they wouldn't want it to end
with their passing.

40:09.660 --> 40:13.620
So, This Life Now will continue.

40:14.100 --> 40:16.900
I will keep their vision alive,

40:16.940 --> 40:19.660
and strive for the best life I can live

40:19.960 --> 40:21.420
now they're gone.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.540
Better now that you
don't have to nurse a husband

40:25.580 --> 40:27.140
with motor neurone disease.

40:31.940 --> 40:33.980
You lied, Anna.

40:35.620 --> 40:38.020
You knew Luca had MND.

40:39.140 --> 40:40.556
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:40.580 --> 40:42.180
You knew what was ahead,

40:42.220 --> 40:45.020
years of pain watching him fade away,

40:45.060 --> 40:47.300
trapped in a body that was dying.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.660
And you'd be trapped too.

40:51.590 --> 40:53.910
No longer able to live
the life you love,

40:54.220 --> 40:56.100
the life he promised you.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.430
So you swapped his pilot chute.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.670
You wanted him to die.

41:03.950 --> 41:05.310
How did it feel?

41:07.180 --> 41:08.300
To say goodbye.

41:10.140 --> 41:11.140
I love you.

41:11.180 --> 41:15.460
To stand here and watch
your husband leap to his death.

41:23.100 --> 41:25.700
But you weren't expecting Tomas
to jump after him.

41:31.340 --> 41:33.220
OK, I'll go first.

41:33.260 --> 41:34.700
See you down there, man.

41:34.740 --> 41:35.940
Go for it, babe!

41:39.300 --> 41:42.810
He saw the Luca's pilot chute
was parked on the wrong side.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.300
Espera, para!

41:44.340 --> 41:45.500
He even tried to warn him!

41:55.540 --> 41:57.300
It was too late.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.300
So you killed him too.

42:00.460 --> 42:01.420
That wasn't my fault.

42:01.460 --> 42:03.140
Yes, it was.

42:07.220 --> 42:10.340
And you are going to have to live
with that for the rest of your life.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.240
No...

42:15.660 --> 42:16.700
I won't.

42:19.860 --> 42:22.260
- Anna, what are you...?
- Seven seconds, doctor,

42:22.300 --> 42:25.700
- that's all it takes.
- No, no, no, don't do this.

42:26.330 --> 42:27.810
Anna, please. Please.

42:28.180 --> 42:29.920
Stay away from me!

42:29.960 --> 42:31.460
Anna, please.

42:32.220 --> 42:33.820
I can't go to jail.

42:33.860 --> 42:35.020
I won't.

42:35.060 --> 42:36.700
This isn't the answer.

42:36.740 --> 42:39.780
I couldn't be a nurse to him
for years and years.

42:39.820 --> 42:41.020
I know.

42:41.060 --> 42:42.150
It's no life, either.

42:42.180 --> 42:43.500
Anna, please.

42:43.540 --> 42:45.540
- Argh!
- No, no, no, no...

42:45.760 --> 42:47.580
- Argh!
- Hold on!

42:53.500 --> 42:55.340
It's OK. It's OK.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.360
It's OK, I've got you.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.500
Thank you.

43:14.460 --> 43:17.620
You know, we should do this
every afternoon.

43:19.620 --> 43:21.900
Every afternoon?

43:23.210 --> 43:24.290
Yeah.

43:24.330 --> 43:25.330
Sure. Yeah.

43:28.060 --> 43:30.500
For f...

43:32.740 --> 43:33.840
Harrow.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.220
Better be bloody good.

43:41.540 --> 43:44.260
You have one new voice message.

43:50.460 --> 43:52.300
Anna!

43:52.390 --> 43:53.630
Please, don't!

43:53.670 --> 43:54.870
Please!

43:56.140 --> 43:57.860
Urgh!

44:00.700 --> 44:02.140
Sorry, doctor.

44:03.660 --> 44:04.740
No...

44:05.580 --> 44:07.340
- No!
- Hey!

44:07.380 --> 44:08.420
Argh!

44:10.980 --> 44:12.820
Je... Need a hand?

44:16.420 --> 44:18.220
Before I ask you any questions,

44:18.450 --> 44:21.490
I must advise you that you have
the right to remain silent.

44:22.340 --> 44:24.780
That means you don't have
to say anything...

44:24.820 --> 44:26.780
She almost had me fooled.

44:27.770 --> 44:29.780
I was this close to believing her.

44:29.820 --> 44:30.940
I did believe her.

44:33.140 --> 44:35.140
Maybe that gut of yours
is worth listening to.

44:42.740 --> 44:44.710
You... You busted your stitches.

44:44.750 --> 44:46.100
It's nothing.

44:46.460 --> 44:47.836
I'll get Nambo to take a look at it.

44:47.860 --> 44:49.820
It's fine, I'll patch it up at home.

44:58.460 --> 45:00.020
Call yourself a surgeon?

45:01.380 --> 45:03.140
Just shut up and keep drinking.

45:03.740 --> 45:04.980
Is there anything stronger?

45:14.750 --> 45:16.320
When you leave the building,

45:16.700 --> 45:18.340
the safety net disappears.

45:18.380 --> 45:19.860
You said that.

45:19.900 --> 45:21.080
Remember?

45:21.340 --> 45:22.820
You could have died!

45:22.860 --> 45:24.580
But I didn't, thanks to you.

45:25.780 --> 45:27.160
And we found the truth.

45:31.380 --> 45:32.790
Are you OK?

45:33.340 --> 45:35.380
The shooting, now this.

45:35.900 --> 45:37.220
All part of a day's work.

45:43.060 --> 45:45.300
I could... stay.

45:50.380 --> 45:51.460
You could.

45:51.600 --> 45:52.840
But I shouldn't.

46:00.700 --> 46:01.700
No.

46:11.220 --> 46:13.140
Call if you need me.

46:56.260 --> 46:57.940
I thought I'd find you here.

47:00.260 --> 47:01.700
You don't think I did it.

47:02.460 --> 47:04.340
No, I don't.

47:06.290 --> 47:09.180
I think someone did this
to you to get to me.

47:10.140 --> 47:11.300
Why?

47:11.660 --> 47:14.590
Because I love you
and they want to hurt me.

47:17.180 --> 47:18.540
Do you know who?

47:20.180 --> 47:21.760
I have no idea.

47:26.100 --> 47:27.580
But I'm going to find out.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.170
_

48:20.310 --> 48:22.260
Someone has a sense of humour.

48:22.300 --> 48:23.980
Mr Lincoln roses.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.140
Because I was shot, too.

48:32.020 --> 48:33.420
Is Bryan here?

48:33.460 --> 48:36.920
- What?
- No, he's asleep. Why? What's that?

48:38.060 --> 48:39.910
Do you remember these bodies?

48:40.180 --> 48:42.890
They were brought into the morgue
15 years ago,

48:42.930 --> 48:44.700
she'd been violently strangled

48:44.740 --> 48:48.500
and he'd been shot
multiple times by this man.

48:54.660 --> 48:55.940
Francis Chester.

48:55.980 --> 48:58.620
There was a string of murders,
just like this one,

48:58.660 --> 48:59.780
all linked to him.

48:59.820 --> 49:01.180
Yes, yes, I remember.

49:01.220 --> 49:03.140
Why... Why are you looking at these?

49:03.180 --> 49:05.980
Because I believe that he was
the man who shot me.

49:07.020 --> 49:08.060
Look.

49:10.460 --> 49:11.940
Mr Lincoln roses.

49:11.980 --> 49:14.180
Do you remember
when I was at the hospital?

49:14.220 --> 49:16.460
Someone sent me the same roses.

49:16.500 --> 49:19.260
There was no name on the card,
but it had to be Chester.

49:19.300 --> 49:20.500
- Harrow...
- Don't you get it?

49:20.540 --> 49:22.930
I put away for these murders
15 years ago

49:22.970 --> 49:24.690
and now he wants to get his own back.

49:24.730 --> 49:26.410
- Harrow...
- Could he have gotten out?

49:26.450 --> 49:29.260
- I mean, did he appeal his sentence?
- Daniel!

49:30.050 --> 49:32.070
It can't have been Francis Chester.

49:32.420 --> 49:33.820
Why? Is he still in jail?

49:33.860 --> 49:35.380
No, no. He's dead.

49:36.420 --> 49:40.460
He died in a prison fire six months ago.

51:03.700 --> 51:05.820
Next on Harrow...

51:05.860 --> 51:09.100
So, if anyone wanted revenge,
it'd be Francis Chester.

51:09.140 --> 51:10.260
Only he's dead.

51:10.300 --> 51:12.410
Whatever it is, maybe I can help.

51:12.720 --> 51:15.090
I won't be pleading guilty
for something I didn't do.

51:15.300 --> 51:17.656
I mean, we've got to find out who
actually put those drugs there.

51:17.680 --> 51:19.290
It's one of the worst parts of this job,

51:19.440 --> 51:22.480
wanting something
and not being able to have it.

51:23.860 --> 51:26.340
Looks like someone
bricked up the asbestos sheeting,

51:26.380 --> 51:27.700
and shoved her in as well.

51:27.740 --> 51:30.140
Maybe someone wasn't trying to kill her,

51:30.180 --> 51:32.700
maybe someone was trying to save her.
