Oh, that was awesome!

00:39.006 --> 00:40.932
Everyone brought their A-game!

00:40.932 --> 00:43.444
I mean, Psycho,
when you made those T-Rex bones
just come to life

00:43.444 --> 00:45.000
and then chase
that guard... Mwah!

00:45.000 --> 00:47.381
Wait, did you just steal
King Tut's body?

00:47.414 --> 00:49.149
Ugh, I was going to see that
on Sunday.

00:49.182 --> 00:51.185
See it? Now you can touch it.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.554
[Clayface gasps]

00:52.554 --> 00:54.322
Yeah, but I've never been,
like, in a museum

00:54.322 --> 00:56.689
and thought, "Oh, I wish
I could touch this dead body."

00:56.723 --> 00:58.024
Uh, well, someone must wanna

00:58.024 --> 00:59.326
'cause it was under
heavy guard.

00:59.359 --> 01:03.030
And, we needed a new ottoman.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.197
We'll get used to it.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.766
The news must be all over this.

01:05.799 --> 01:09.003
Let's see what they're sayin'
about us on Villainy.evil.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.572
Wait... What?

01:10.605 --> 01:13.174
KGBeast's getting nominated
for the Legion of Doom?

01:13.206 --> 01:14.709
I'm way better than him.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.144
People must be freaking out
in the comments.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.647
"This was long overdue. Yay."

01:19.680 --> 01:21.915
"Worked with him
on three assassinations.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.216
So professional.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.951
Couldn't have happened
to a better guy."

01:24.984 --> 01:26.319
Screw you, better guy.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.155
What the hell does it take
to get nominated?

01:28.188 --> 01:30.024
Ooh, look,
here's one about you,

01:30.057 --> 01:32.393
"Why's no one talking
about Harley Quinn?

01:32.427 --> 01:35.162
I'd like to nominate her
to sit on my face."

01:35.195 --> 01:37.131
Okay, well, that... Mm.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.599
Should have read it through.

[grunts]

01:43.370 --> 01:45.640
Um, do you wanna just,
like, use your words?

01:45.640 --> 01:49.543
I've been busting my ass
to get noticed by the Legion
for the last two months.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.212
I've done everything
there is to do.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.546
You mean we've done?

01:52.579 --> 01:54.180
Yeah, I was using
the royal "I."

01:54.215 --> 01:56.150
Sorry for the rant.
I'm, I'm, I'm fine now.

-[growls, grunts]
-[others gasp and grunt]

01:58.084 --> 02:00.888
Okay, now I'm fine.

02:00.921 --> 02:05.025
Hey, so, I can't help
but notice you're being
extra Harley today.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.727
And I just, honestly,

02:06.760 --> 02:08.896
I don't understand
your obsession
with the Legion of Doom.

02:08.930 --> 02:11.799
I mean, those guys
are genuinely pieces of shit.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.768
Uh, yeah. Obviously.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.871
But those pieces of shit
are the only people Joker
ever treated as equals.

02:16.905 --> 02:19.340
I'll never match up to him
unless I'm in the Legion, too.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.108
Okay, so, what you're saying is

02:21.141 --> 02:22.509
you're not over your ex,

02:22.509 --> 02:24.544
and you wanna throw
your success in his face.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.578
Exactly.

02:25.578 --> 02:27.649
Honestly, that might be
the most relatable thing
you've ever said.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.550
All right, people,
listen, I want ideas.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.618
Somethin' that's gonna get us
on the Legion of Doom's radar.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.824
I could call my old pal
Hank Kissinger.

02:33.824 --> 02:37.024
I'm sure he hasa few war crimes
he never pulled off.

02:37.056 --> 02:38.359
I know we're criminals,

02:38.391 --> 02:40.394
but are we really
war criminals?

02:40.427 --> 02:41.962
No one thinks
they're a war criminal,

02:41.997 --> 02:44.164
then you find yourself aiding
a separatist movement

02:44.198 --> 02:45.966
to overthrow
a democratically elected leader

02:46.000 --> 02:48.201
and boom,
you're a war criminal.

02:48.201 --> 02:49.804
Maybe we could steal
some new computers

02:49.804 --> 02:52.272
'cause that one
you smashed was mine.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.508
That's it. WayneTech.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.842
You wanna legally
purchase computers?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.044
I wasn't thinkin' legal,

02:57.076 --> 02:59.212
and I wasn't
thinking computers.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.716
We're gonna rob Bruce Wayne.

03:02.748 --> 03:06.049
[theme music playing]

03:09.691 --> 03:12.026
All right, this is what
we're going after.

03:12.058 --> 03:14.328
[gasps] It's beautiful.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.929
And on the 26th floor.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.532
Cool. How we gonna
get it down?

03:17.564 --> 03:20.268
We'll <i>Fast and Furious 7</i> it.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.270
Guys, that's the one
where they shoot a car

03:22.302 --> 03:24.572
from one skyscraper
into another skyscraper.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.108
But, you know, ultimately,
they're just all about family.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.277
Clayface, activate
"Operation Douche."

03:30.311 --> 03:32.847
Uh, sir, please,
have you seen my daughter?

03:32.881 --> 03:34.782
I mean well, technically,
I'm not her father.

03:34.816 --> 03:39.219
I mean, you see, the Lord hath
cursed me with empathy, it's...

03:39.252 --> 03:41.020
for my wife strayed.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.590
It's an emotionally
complex tale,

03:42.623 --> 03:45.727
that, if you have
two hours to spare,

03:45.759 --> 03:48.429
I can burden you
with my tale of woe.

03:48.462 --> 03:51.331
Harley, thank you
for letting me
use my brains, for once.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.834

who I am.

what we're workin' with here.

the first three doors,

at the entrance to the room
is on you.

Oh, shit.

04:11.718 --> 04:14.256
Now why was
she put down so gently?

04:14.256 --> 04:17.824
Um, because she's not
a misogynist troll that
should be living in a well?

04:17.824 --> 04:22.163

dumb twisty twirls
and get the bike,

the hell out of here?

are you doing?

I was cuckolded--

and get my limb?

05:53.922 --> 05:55.790
You know, she's sleeping
with someone else.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.425
And the worst part,
I can't blame her.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.026
I mean, a woman
can only go so long

05:59.026 --> 06:01.327
watching the dead eyes
of her lover thrust atop her,

06:01.362 --> 06:03.197
before she looks
for something new.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.899
So, you didn't call me
about the break-in
at Wayne Enterprises?

06:05.932 --> 06:07.134
What? No.

06:07.168 --> 06:09.269
Oh, this is about
the break-down of my marriage.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.271
The signal is for emergencies.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.939
-Well...
-Emergencies.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.300
You've abused it.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.076
Look, my personal life
is a mess right now,

06:16.076 --> 06:18.845
and I thought I could talk
about that with my friend.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.449
We're co-workers.

06:20.449 --> 06:22.716
Harley stole some
highly sensitive tech
from Wayne Enterprises.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.017
In her hands,
it could be catastrophic.

from the crime scene.

-Yeah, what's that?
-Ask it yourself.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.060

such a damn good cop.

that security guard, mwah!

Ah-uh. Don't you dare
Italian chef finger kiss

06:55.281 --> 06:57.084
any part of that disaster.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.685
You screwed up the plan.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.654
I'm ready for the heist,

07:00.687 --> 07:04.891
and it's-a gonna
be-a delicious.

Shit. I missed the heist,
didn't I?

07:20.795 --> 07:22.175
If you could call it that.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.976

07:24.011 --> 07:25.812
No, no, it's fine.

07:25.812 --> 07:29.050
I'll just play
one-armed characters
for the rest of my career.

07:29.084 --> 07:32.218
Perhaps they'll make
a sequel to <i>127 Hours.</i>

07:32.218 --> 07:33.620
There has been light buzz.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.156

small-time, all right?

than that bike.

of the Legion of Doom.

You have no idea
what that does, do you?

07:47.334 --> 07:48.334
Yes, I do.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.536
Something...

07:49.569 --> 07:51.000
Something button related?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.406
Look, either way,
it is obviously important.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.742
I bet you this heist's
all over the news.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.812
I mean, look,
this is what I'm talkin' about.

07:57.812 --> 07:59.514

by The Cowled Critic.

tell me about him?

09:08.182 --> 09:09.249
and do everything for her.

09:09.283 --> 09:10.283
-Everything!
-[whimpers]

09:10.283 --> 09:11.753
But that's not your problem.

09:11.787 --> 09:14.655
Well, she doesn't sound
like a friend to me.

09:14.690 --> 09:17.291
That's exactly what I've been
saying to anyone
who would listen to me.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.725
Which is no one.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.827
But that's not
what we're here to talk about.

09:20.861 --> 09:24.498
But maybe it should be, Jim.

09:24.532 --> 09:26.634
My God, you're right...

09:26.667 --> 09:29.235
So, it knows
everything you know?

09:29.269 --> 09:30.804
Yes, we've been over this.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.173
My arm is a piece of me.

09:32.206 --> 09:33.841
But it wouldn't
give away our location,

09:33.875 --> 09:35.909
turn us in,
testify against us, would it?

09:35.942 --> 09:37.812
Who knows? It's like a kid.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.113
It'll do anything for approval.

09:39.147 --> 09:41.081
Huh, wonder
where it got that from.

09:41.115 --> 09:43.051
Ugh, if he squeals,
the Cowled Critic
will have a field day,

09:43.051 --> 09:45.086
and the Legion of Doom
will never take me.

09:45.119 --> 09:47.922
But, mostly,
we'll all be in prison
for the rest of our lives.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.346
Oh, yeah, that, that too.

09:49.346 --> 09:52.458
And I'll never get my lost,
little right hand man back.

09:52.493 --> 09:54.062
Yeah, that, that,
that too, too.

09:54.062 --> 09:55.662
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, you know what,

09:55.663 --> 09:57.133
I think I speak for everyone
when I say

09:57.133 --> 09:59.866
that this is completely
fucking stupid.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.604
Can you please fire me now,
so I can get some unemployment?

10:01.604 --> 10:03.703
Okay. No one's going anywhere.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.407
'Cause we're gonna
rescue your arm.

10:05.440 --> 10:09.177
We are gonna break into
the Gotham City
Police Department.

10:09.210 --> 10:13.014
If we pull it off,
the Legion'll call us
in no time.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.782
Oh, and Clayface
will have two arms.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.851
Look, I'd love to come along,
and support you but--

10:16.884 --> 10:19.386
But ya wanna find the critic
that said you're the biggest
fuck up on my crew

10:19.386 --> 10:20.955
and tear him a new asshole,
I get it, I get it.

10:20.955 --> 10:22.456
I will not be slandered.

10:22.490 --> 10:25.292
I'll help. I'll help you
smack him around a little bit.

10:25.326 --> 10:27.004
What? For you. Obviously.

10:27.004 --> 10:29.529
I mean, I can't let this
anonymous asshole talk shit
about my best friend, right?

10:29.529 --> 10:31.835
Aw, Ive,
you'd hurt him for me?

10:31.868 --> 10:33.868
Yes. Absolutely.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.403
And because he claimed
I'm fucking Psycho.

10:36.437 --> 10:37.738
But mostly for you, babe.

10:37.772 --> 10:38.905
But also for me.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.340
But for you.
For us.

10:40.341 --> 10:41.943
It's fine.
Let's go.

10:44.178 --> 10:48.182
I can't believe that
bad old Batman took away
your special signal.

10:48.216 --> 10:50.518
After all the cases
I've helped him solve.

10:50.518 --> 10:52.019
I'm the one
that does the grunt work.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.988
All I ask is that occasionally

10:53.988 --> 10:56.823
when my wife
is emotionally distant
during sex, he listens.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.058
Not to the sex,

10:58.091 --> 10:59.426
But, to me,
talking about the...

10:59.460 --> 11:00.760
Yeah.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.062
Jim, you sound
like a really good cop.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.832
[gasps]

11:04.832 --> 11:09.068
You know, it's just been
so long since I've heard
someone else say that, I was...

11:09.068 --> 11:11.038
I was just starting to wonder
if it was really true.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.908
It's true to me... friend.

11:13.941 --> 11:17.390
[cheery music playing]

11:48.576 --> 11:50.912
[thuds and grunts]

11:50.945 --> 11:53.345
[muffled cries]

11:56.083 --> 12:00.053
A one armed officer...
The stories my mind is weaving.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.956
Ooh. How could he lose it?
A shootout? Maybe.

12:02.990 --> 12:06.594
An explosion? Perhaps!
I know, diabetes!

12:06.626 --> 12:08.962
So, when they arrest me,
I go full shark

12:08.995 --> 12:10.764
and start a riot to cause
a distraction?

12:10.764 --> 12:12.231
[Harley] <i>Yep!</i>
<i>Easy as one, two--</i>

12:12.231 --> 12:14.567
Shark!

12:14.601 --> 12:17.403
[grunting]

12:17.437 --> 12:20.240
[tires screeching]

12:20.274 --> 12:22.909
[camera clicks]

12:22.943 --> 12:26.114
Okay, okay. Plan B. Clayface,
you gotta distract 'em.

12:26.147 --> 12:29.317
Brilliant! Hm,
what do cops love?

12:29.350 --> 12:32.086
It is I again,
your fellow officer.

12:32.120 --> 12:35.089
Hello, chums. I come
baring horrible news!

12:35.123 --> 12:37.625
Joker has kidnapped
Bruce Springsteen.

12:37.658 --> 12:40.293
Some rat fuck stole The Boss!

12:40.326 --> 12:41.427
Don't worry, The Boss.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.697
We're coming for you, Boss!

12:43.730 --> 12:45.466
-[tires screeching]
-[sirens blaring]

12:45.466 --> 12:47.335
[woman on phone] <i>Hello?</i>
<i>My husband's been murdered</i>

12:47.335 --> 12:50.065
<i>and the killer's still</i>
<i>in the ho--</i>

12:54.442 --> 12:57.671
Come on. Just tell me
where Harley's lair is.

12:57.671 --> 13:00.748
I'm your friend, not them.
You said it yourself.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.515
You mean that?

13:02.548 --> 13:03.985
You're not just pretending?

13:03.985 --> 13:05.253
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.822
I was, but then
you listened to me

13:08.855 --> 13:11.024
graphically explain
the problematic intercourse

13:11.057 --> 13:12.928
I'm having with my wife and...

13:12.961 --> 13:15.395
Well, gosh darn it,
you didn't judge me.

13:15.429 --> 13:18.732
Well, Jim, you can't judge
what you don't understand.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.067
God, you're so wise.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.070
Aw, thanks, friend.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.272
You know what? I'm gonna
tell you where the lair is.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.274
The lair is on--

13:26.274 --> 13:27.908
-Don't tell him anything!
-My child!

13:27.942 --> 13:30.510
Give us The Arm, Gordon. Now!

13:30.543 --> 13:32.147
Oh, Jim, don't let 'em take me.

13:32.181 --> 13:36.283
You need me, right?
'Cause I'm... I'm epidence?

13:36.317 --> 13:38.419
Ho-ho-hold on there, crazy guy.

13:38.452 --> 13:41.423
You're a lot more
than just "epidence."

13:41.456 --> 13:43.424
And I'm not going
to let these animals touch you.

13:43.457 --> 13:46.226
If you've got ears, stick
your fingers in 'em right now

13:46.260 --> 13:47.995
because I'm about to work blue.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.865
I'm gonna fuck you to death
with bullets!

13:50.898 --> 13:54.048
[Clayface screaming]

13:56.037 --> 13:59.374
So, you found The Cowled
Critic's house because you--

13:59.407 --> 14:03.110
Heard it through the grapevine.
Yeah, it is a real thing.

14:03.144 --> 14:07.548
[Dr. Psycho] Oh, shit.
It's you. Of course, it's you!

14:07.581 --> 14:09.216
-Who's she?
-My ex-wife.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.418
Why are you
at my boyfriend's house?

14:11.452 --> 14:14.421
Quick side bar.
How did this work... sexually?

14:14.455 --> 14:16.686
Not great!

14:17.258 --> 14:18.993
Oh, I should have called this!

14:19.025 --> 14:21.129
I know you're
The Cowled Critic!

14:21.162 --> 14:22.863
You gave that review sayin'

14:22.897 --> 14:24.466
me and chick weed here
are a couple.

14:24.466 --> 14:28.101
You think I care about you
and your jolly green whore?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.336
Okay. I'm standing right here.

14:29.370 --> 14:31.538
I don't have time
to give some review.

14:31.572 --> 14:34.509
I'm too busy
getting cunnilingus
from my new boyfriend,

14:34.542 --> 14:37.443
-Brad, who's amazing at it.
-[Dr. Psycho] Oh, come on.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.046
Only weak men do that.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.481
[laughs nervously]
Oh, fuckin' hell!

14:41.514 --> 14:42.984
Call me. In other news,

14:43.017 --> 14:45.485
if you didn't
write the review, who did?

14:45.485 --> 14:46.485
Father.

14:46.485 --> 14:47.687
Herman?

14:47.721 --> 14:50.224
[gun clicks]

14:50.224 --> 14:52.025
Just give us The Arm, Gordon.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.726
You'll have to kill me first!

14:53.760 --> 14:55.796
He's my friend. My only friend!

14:55.796 --> 14:56.764
What about Batman?

14:56.764 --> 14:58.365
He's no friend.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.399
Now that Batman's abandoned me,
this hand is all I have.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.273
So, you'll have to pry
this hand out of
my cold dead... hand.

15:05.306 --> 15:08.075
Why can't you
just leave us alone?

15:08.075 --> 15:09.110
What he said!

15:09.143 --> 15:10.378
Okay. He's sidin' with Gordon.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.212
He's gonna snitch
and ruin everything,

15:12.245 --> 15:14.149
and I will never
get into the Legion.

15:14.183 --> 15:16.116
-And I'd like to have two arms.
-Oh.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.618
Yeah, that too.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.019
All right. Two options, Gordy.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.821
Give us The Arm and we leave,

15:20.855 --> 15:22.255
or I press this button

15:22.289 --> 15:25.225
and blow this whole fuckin'
place sky-high.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.561
Harley, this wasn't the plan.

15:26.594 --> 15:28.562
We have no idea
what that button does.

15:28.596 --> 15:31.164
I gotta do something crazy
and in the chaos
we'll grab The Arm.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.932
Okay. You winked.
Is that a wink?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.501
That-- "No, I'm not going
to press the button?"

15:34.501 --> 15:36.370
Is that a wink? "I am going
to press the button?"

15:36.370 --> 15:37.171
What's the plan?

15:37.171 --> 15:38.572
-Exactly.
-What?

15:38.572 --> 15:40.207
You've got three seconds
to put that button down

15:40.207 --> 15:42.809
or I'll pull this trigger.
So help me God.

15:42.842 --> 15:46.379
Three... two... one.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.913
[gunshot]

15:51.585 --> 15:54.884
[electricity buzzing]

15:57.356 --> 15:58.393
Ah...

15:58.426 --> 16:03.426
Uh, well, I wasn't
expecting that.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.067
What the hell? [screaming]

16:07.100 --> 16:08.403
-[thuds]
-[Harley grunting]

16:08.437 --> 16:10.803
[groans]

16:10.837 --> 16:13.139
[screaming]

16:13.173 --> 16:16.143
[Batman] So, Quinn,
you pressed the button.

16:16.177 --> 16:18.477
Yeah, I don't think you got
all the kinks worked out.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.847
It's in beta.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.116
Wow! I always wondered
what the Batcave looked like.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.785
So this must be
where you fuck the bats.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.687
-Hmm.
-[Harley] Are you gonna
help me or what?

16:26.720 --> 16:28.121
You've seen the Batcave.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.691
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't let you drop.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.427
Um... Uh...

16:32.460 --> 16:34.596
Hey, Bats, yeah, I'm here
on a mercy mission, okay?

16:34.629 --> 16:36.663
Gordon's on the roof
of the police department.

16:36.697 --> 16:38.399
He's lost his mind.

16:38.399 --> 16:41.535
I mean, I think he's suicidal.
He-- He said you abandoned him.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.136
I don't know
what he wants from me.

16:43.171 --> 16:45.940
We're co-workers.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.740
My screensaver
just kicked in, didn't it?

16:47.774 --> 16:49.200
Yeah. It sure did.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.044
I mean, he said
you put your work
before your friendship.

16:51.077 --> 16:55.015
That's real... Selfish.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.018
You know, Bats,
now that I think about it,

16:57.018 --> 16:58.285
you and I ain't that different.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.687
We're completely different.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.822
We're both bad asses
who look good in spandex.

17:01.822 --> 17:05.026
This polymer body armor
is made from indestructible
micro-fiber.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.492
Yeah, no, it looks
like spandex.

17:06.527 --> 17:09.029
[screaming]

17:09.063 --> 17:10.131
[crashes]

17:10.163 --> 17:13.034
[Harley] [groans]

17:13.067 --> 17:15.068
My friend just lost his arm

17:15.102 --> 17:17.471
and, instead of helpin' him
get it back,

17:17.505 --> 17:20.840
I did what would help me
get into the Legion of Doom.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.442
I let him down.

17:22.477 --> 17:25.880
Just like you let Gordon down.

17:25.913 --> 17:27.948
Not good at... emotion.

17:27.981 --> 17:29.049
Or...

17:29.083 --> 17:30.451
[in Batman's voice] Vocabulary.

17:30.451 --> 17:32.286
But hey, you got a chance
to repair it, okay?

17:32.286 --> 17:34.422
We need to get Gordon
before he does somethin' crazy.

17:34.422 --> 17:37.057
Your friend needs you now.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.125
Hmm.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.994
Herman, my sweet Herman.

17:41.028 --> 17:43.431
Listen, I understand
your monster mom

17:43.463 --> 17:47.268
saying those things about me,
but my brood, my own kin?

17:47.268 --> 17:50.505
You made my entire life
a living hell.

17:50.538 --> 17:53.106
You locked me
in the basement for days...

17:53.140 --> 17:56.411
-Mm-hmm.
-...killed anyone
who seemed to like me...

17:56.443 --> 17:58.981
-That's true.
-...never bought me
a WayneStation4...

17:58.981 --> 18:02.250
-All right.
-Fuck! You named me Herman!

18:02.282 --> 18:04.218
You're the worst father ever!

18:04.251 --> 18:06.386
Okay. Can we just
take a step back?

18:06.421 --> 18:09.624
I made your life
a living hell...

18:09.656 --> 18:12.192
-because I care about you.
-What?

18:12.226 --> 18:15.328
Supervillains don't come
from happy homes.

18:15.363 --> 18:18.933
and I saw so much
evil potential in you.

18:18.933 --> 18:21.903
If I didn't think you could
become the worst person
in the world,

18:21.936 --> 18:24.971
I wouldn't have tried so hard
to make your life awful.

18:25.005 --> 18:26.240
I...

18:26.273 --> 18:27.977
I only ever wanted
to impress you,

18:28.009 --> 18:31.077
but I never thought
I was evil enough.

18:31.112 --> 18:33.717
Uh-uh-uh. Nuh-uh.
No. Don't cry. Don't cry.

18:33.717 --> 18:36.284
You're gonna make me cry
because I thought
I failed as a father,

18:36.284 --> 18:39.119
and you ended up happy,
and heroic.

18:39.153 --> 18:40.354
But look at you.

18:40.387 --> 18:43.190
You're more evil
than I could've dreamed.

18:43.223 --> 18:47.428
I couldn't be more
proud of you, my terrible son.

18:47.461 --> 18:50.000
I hate you, Dad. [sniffling]
I hate you so much.

18:50.032 --> 18:52.833
I hate you too, son.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.835
This is so fucked up,

18:54.867 --> 18:56.869
but weirdly really moving.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.239
[Herman sobbing]

18:58.271 --> 18:59.873
All right, I'm going to
let you guys go.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.709
I'm going to go find Brad.

19:01.742 --> 19:04.778
If you want to stay
with Gordon, I understand.
[sniffling]

19:04.778 --> 19:07.315
[in shaky voice]
I only want you to be
safe and...

19:07.315 --> 19:08.348
[sniffling]

19:08.382 --> 19:12.653
Safe and happy.

19:12.686 --> 19:15.221
-Holy shit! Can we
do that again?
-No.

19:15.256 --> 19:16.423
Oh, so you came back.

19:16.457 --> 19:18.291
Well, I've got a new friend now

19:18.326 --> 19:19.993
-so there's nothing
you can say--
-I'm sorry, Jim.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.394
I'm sorry, too.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.864
I knew you'd realize
our friendship means

19:22.864 --> 19:25.066
more than just
our day-to-day crime fighting.

19:25.099 --> 19:29.970
And that we can lean
on each other for our
most intimate emotional needs.

19:30.003 --> 19:34.275
Sure.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.609
A damn good bat signal.

19:35.643 --> 19:37.711
-[Gordon] Well...
-For a damn good cop.

19:37.711 --> 19:38.645
Aw...

19:38.645 --> 19:42.855
[The Arm sniffling and whining]

19:42.855 --> 19:46.287
Thank you for everything,
The Arm.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.255
But I've got my real friend
back now,

19:48.288 --> 19:49.757
so you can go on.

19:49.790 --> 19:51.758
Go get reabsorbed
back into your daddy.

19:51.791 --> 19:55.429
[whining]

19:55.462 --> 19:56.762
Aw, don't do that.

19:56.797 --> 19:58.164
[sniffling]

19:58.164 --> 19:59.400
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

19:59.401 --> 20:00.667
[sniffles]

20:00.701 --> 20:03.707
Oh, Jim. I'll never forget yo--

20:03.707 --> 20:06.040
[exclaims] Well done!

20:06.074 --> 20:08.442
All right, Quinn. Time for me
to take you to Arkham.

20:08.476 --> 20:10.344
Wait, what? I just repaired

20:10.377 --> 20:12.080
your most important
adult relationship.

20:12.115 --> 20:14.481
[Harley grunts]

20:14.515 --> 20:17.815
[electricity buzzing]

20:19.686 --> 20:21.489
-[cop 1] Everybody hands up!
-[cop 2] Hands in the air.

20:21.489 --> 20:24.724
-[cop 1] You're under arrest!
-Not so fast, gentlemen.

20:24.758 --> 20:25.960
Dance, coppers!

20:25.992 --> 20:28.061
[cops exclaiming]

20:28.095 --> 20:32.701
Let's go. Let's get outta here.

20:32.736 --> 20:34.568
[sighs]

20:34.602 --> 20:38.406
[Dr. Psycho] What a pussy!

20:38.440 --> 20:41.775
<i>...and so it is</i>
<i>with a humble heart,</i>

20:41.808 --> 20:45.846
<i>that I come to, Cowlheads,
retracting my previous review.</i>

20:45.880 --> 20:48.715
Harley Quinn and her crew have
<i>more than proven themselves.</i>

20:48.750 --> 20:52.319
Look, look, obviously
I want to get into
the Legion of Doom super bad.

20:52.353 --> 20:53.721
It's incredibly
important to me,

20:53.755 --> 20:56.257
but not more important
than you guys.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.093
Check this out, everybody!

20:58.125 --> 21:01.663
<i>And I want to give a special</i>
<i>shout out to Dr. Psycho,</i>

21:01.695 --> 21:04.064
<i>who I slandered</i>
<i>in my last review.</i>

21:04.097 --> 21:05.666
Feeling really bad about that.

21:05.700 --> 21:09.636
Using his amazing brain powers,
<i>he made Batman vanish.</i>

21:09.671 --> 21:11.839
<i>His super cool son</i>
<i>must be so proud.</i>

21:11.839 --> 21:13.875
-Uh... That's not what--
-Let him have this.

21:13.907 --> 21:15.809
<i>Also want to apologize</i>
<i>for saying</i>

21:15.844 --> 21:18.445
<i>Poison Ivy</i>
<i>and Dr. Psycho are a couple.</i>

21:18.479 --> 21:19.513
<i>That one's on me.</i>

21:19.547 --> 21:21.148
-Ah, thank God.
-Finally.

21:21.182 --> 21:24.085
Harley Quinn and her crew are
<i>worthy of being nominated</i>

21:24.118 --> 21:27.288
<i>for this year's class</i>
<i>of the Legion of Doom.</i>

21:27.288 --> 21:30.365
<i>if she could only just stop</i>
<i>leaving crew members behind.</i>

21:30.365 --> 21:31.758
We didn't leave anybody--

21:31.791 --> 21:33.093
Oh, shit!

21:33.126 --> 21:34.428
[slurping] Mm.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.829
[smacks lips] Mm.

21:36.864 --> 21:38.499
[giggles]

21:38.532 --> 21:41.469
Darrell, if you ever bring me
inferior toilet wine again,

21:41.501 --> 21:43.436
I'll be forced to shank you
in the showers

21:43.471 --> 21:45.573
and you know
I don't want to do that.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.309
I like being "cool boss."

21:47.343 --> 21:50.979
[explosion]

21:51.011 --> 21:54.347
Hey, King. I am so sorry for
leavin' ya here for so long.

21:54.347 --> 21:55.717
-Oh, no problem.
-[distant sirens]

21:55.717 --> 21:57.518
It allowed me
to experience firsthand

21:57.551 --> 21:59.921
the failings of the prison
industrial complex.

21:59.953 --> 22:03.523
-[prisoner 1] Yeah! Fresh fish!
-[prisoner 2] Here fishy,
fishy, fishy, fishy.

22:03.557 --> 22:05.059
[laughing and kissing]

22:05.093 --> 22:07.096
Now, fellas, look, I know
it's just in fun, but...

22:07.130 --> 22:10.597
[yelling] What the fuck did I
tell you about that word?

22:10.631 --> 22:13.166
-Oh, yeah. Sorry, King.
-Ooh. Sorry about that.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.201
Oh. They're learning.

22:15.236 --> 22:17.038
Baby steps, right, Harley?

22:17.071 --> 22:19.874
[yelling] I will kill each
and every one of you

22:19.907 --> 22:23.477
with my bare hands
if I have to!

22:23.510 --> 23:49.933
[theme music playing]
