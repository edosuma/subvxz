Mm, hardly ever,

13:03.751 --> 13:04.876
Mm.

Well, I spent a couple of terms

13:22.542 --> 13:24.751
They've cleaned it out now.
It's a dead cell.

13:26.542 --> 13:28.626
Dead?

13:28.626 --> 13:30.292
I didn't know that.

13:35.459 --> 13:38.501
Well, it's been a long time.
Uh, this way.

13:38.501 --> 13:41.209
I see by your scan, you've never
been to Earth, have you?

13:41.209 --> 13:43.292
No, no, I haven't.

13:43.917 --> 13:45.876

You get the bulletins,
don't you?

14:05.042 --> 14:06.709
You're supposed

14:07.917 --> 14:09.709
We do acknowledge.

14:09.709 --> 14:11.459
But we don't always scan.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.042
No.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.667

14:53.542 --> 14:54.876
What's in there?

14:57.417 --> 14:59.292
I have to sound Earth

Oh, yes.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.792
No external contact while
we're shadow locked.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.417
- You know that.
- Of course.

15:11.417 --> 15:13.001
How long will it last?

15:13.001 --> 15:16.584
- Twenty-two days.
- Mm-hm.

15:16.584 --> 15:18.209
I need some rest.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.584
Alex, show the captain
to his quarters.

15:21.542 --> 15:22.959
Major.

15:27.834 --> 15:30.084
Can I get you anything,
some ervil?

15:30.084 --> 15:32.584
No, I'll just take a couple
of blues and crash.

<i>- Blues?
- Blues-- blue dreamers.</i>

15:36.084 --> 15:37.501

15:42.126 --> 15:43.667

Here, in case you choose
to try one.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.376

16:19.626 --> 16:22.376
- One thing I envy him.
- Mm, what's that?

16:22.376 --> 16:25.417
He's breathed.
I mean, we lead a shut life here.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.501
It must be really something
to go outside and breath.

16:28.501 --> 16:31.417
When I was last there,
if you went outside and breathed,

16:31.417 --> 16:33.876

to rust your tubes.

16:33.876 --> 16:35.167

Mm!

<i>- The captain.
- I don't know.</i>

16:40.584 --> 16:42.709
<i>- He's funny.
- Funny'?</i>

16:42.709 --> 16:44.959
I must have missed
his best lines.

16:46.001 --> 16:48.334
- Adam.
- Hm?

16:48.334 --> 16:49.709
What are blues?

16:50.584 --> 16:51.876
Blues?

16:53.126 --> 16:54.917
Blue dreamers.

16:54.917 --> 16:56.584
Where'd you get that?

16:56.584 --> 16:57.792
From him.

16:59.042 --> 17:01.792
He had no business
giving you this.

17:01.792 --> 17:03.751
What do they do?

17:03.751 --> 17:05.501
Well, when they send
someone out alone,

17:05.501 --> 17:08.584
they give them some of these
to keep them from going static.

17:08.584 --> 17:10.209
Did you ever take one?

17:11.126 --> 17:13.001
Blue dreamers?

17:13.001 --> 17:14.501
Did you?

17:14.501 --> 17:15.876
Years ago.

17:19.791 --> 17:21.459
What was it like?

17:21.459 --> 17:23.001
Huh?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.334
You heard me.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.376
Interesting.

17:30.792 --> 17:33.001
- Let's try one.
- Hm?

17:33.001 --> 17:34.209
Together.

17:35.417 --> 17:37.667
- Maybe.
- Come on.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.084
Please?

17:41.334 --> 17:43.792
After he goes.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.917
How long do you think
he's gonna be here?

17:45.917 --> 17:48.001
No longer than I can help.

Yes, you have a great body.

May I use it?

19:25.001 --> 19:26.334
I'm with the major.

Yes.

Maybe I should help him.

24:23.209 --> 24:25.792
Once I can get its head together,
it will take over your program.

24:25.792 --> 24:27.542
- Take over?
- With a little help.

24:27.542 --> 24:29.001
Then what?

24:29.001 --> 24:31.084
Then one of you
will be obsolete.

24:39.917 --> 24:43.709
[sighs] We can apply
for re-mission together, can't we?

24:44.876 --> 24:47.001
We have to find a way
to stay together.

24:48.084 --> 24:52.126
The truth is
I'm close to abort time.

24:54.292 --> 24:57.376
I hoped they'd have
forgotten us.

24:57.376 --> 24:59.417
[Alex]
They never seem to forget.

25:06.584 --> 25:08.417
Obsolete.

25:12.334 --> 25:16.334
Alex, I've got it.

25:16.334 --> 25:19.417
We flush the captain
and his friend into space.

25:20.459 --> 25:22.209
- You wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

25:22.209 --> 25:24.917
People are being flushed
all over the solar system.

25:24.917 --> 25:26.709
No one cares.

25:26.709 --> 25:28.292
That's a horrible idea.

25:29.751 --> 25:31.459
It's a great idea.

25:32.709 --> 25:35.292
Come here, baby.
Yes.

26:21.042 --> 26:23.626
- Blue dreamers?
- Mm-hm.

26:24.876 --> 26:26.209
Now?

26:27.251 --> 26:28.584
Why not?

26:35.417 --> 26:36.876
<i>Ahh!</i>

26:40.376 --> 26:42.167
I don't feel anything.

26:45.584 --> 26:49.001
You always want
instantaneous satisfaction.

26:50.334 --> 26:52.126
Do you miss it?

26:52.126 --> 26:53.876
Maybe it's different now.

26:53.876 --> 26:56.001
Yeah, maybe it's worse.

26:57.667 --> 27:00.001
That pill is getting to you.

27:00.001 --> 27:01.167
No.

27:08.584 --> 27:10.209
I think you ought
to go to Earth.

27:10.876 --> 27:12.042
What?

27:14.917 --> 27:16.501
You said I'd hate it.

27:16.501 --> 27:20.209
Well, find out for yourself
if you hate it.

27:20.209 --> 27:21.417
I don't want to go.

27:23.751 --> 27:25.167
Yes, you do.

27:25.709 --> 27:26.834
Oh.

27:28.459 --> 27:29.751
I just want to have been.

27:29.751 --> 27:32.084
So, have been.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.209
And leave you?

27:34.792 --> 27:37.084
It's gonna happen
sooner or later.

I wanted you to meet Hector.

29:22.834 --> 29:23.959
Adam.

29:25.792 --> 29:27.876
Give it a simple instruction.
Ask it something.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.459
- Hector?
- Yes.

29:34.459 --> 29:37.501
Hector, hand the flask
to the major.

29:43.209 --> 29:44.459
Abort.

29:47.709 --> 29:50.167
I'm glad you didn't ask him
to shake hands.

Wheel and peditate.

29:58.084 --> 30:00.751
Obviously, there's still some more
fine tuning to do.

Begin.

31:18.876 --> 31:21.459
- Mm.
- I thought you had me.

31:21.459 --> 31:22.959
I think you have me.

31:24.501 --> 31:26.792
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening.

31:27.917 --> 31:29.376
Can he play?

31:29.376 --> 31:32.292
Yes.
I play, he plays.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.417
I'd like to see that.

31:37.917 --> 31:39.167
Hector.

31:40.709 --> 31:42.376
All right.

31:44.584 --> 31:48.084

a small wager, Hector, hm?

31:48.084 --> 31:49.626

31:49.626 --> 31:51.626
<i>[Captain] He doesn't like
to be laughed at.</i>

31:51.626 --> 31:53.501
Can't you program him
to have a sense of humor?

31:53.501 --> 31:55.001
That's not an early priority.

31:55.001 --> 31:58.251
Oh, come on, you can't program
a sense of humor.

31:58.251 --> 32:00.501
Anything I have, sir,
he can have.

32:00.501 --> 32:02.459
Well then, he'll definitely have
a sense of humor.

Who's white?

32:06.417 --> 32:07.959
You be, Hector.

32:23.876 --> 32:25.751
How does he learn?

32:25.751 --> 32:27.667
Direct input.

32:27.667 --> 32:30.417
He sits him down
in front of a blackboard.

32:30.417 --> 32:32.209
I said direct input.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.417
But how do you work that?

32:38.667 --> 32:40.209
Brain to brain.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.876
A brain drain?

32:45.084 --> 32:47.792
You mean, he draws
from your brain?

32:47.792 --> 32:50.376
Yes, when I want him to.

32:52.001 --> 32:53.459
But how?

32:55.334 --> 32:57.584

What were you thinking?

33:59.167 --> 34:00.876
Exchange and simplify.

34:00.876 --> 34:03.709
And you can control
whatever you think?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.751
- Yes.
- I wish I could.

34:05.751 --> 34:08.376
<i>[Captain] I teach him

34:09.751 --> 34:11.792
You haven't taught him enough.

34:11.792 --> 34:16.376
Sacrifice-- that's one thing
you can't teach them, Captain.

34:16.376 --> 34:18.001
Sacrifice.

- Checkmate.
- [squealing]

34:36.917 --> 34:40.001
goes straight into that robot.

34:40.001 --> 34:42.001
Doesn't that scare you?

34:42.001 --> 34:45.458
Not really, the captain's
been carefully selected.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.708
He's trained.

34:46.708 --> 34:48.708
To control his thoughts?

34:48.708 --> 34:50.167
Of course.

34:50.167 --> 34:51.792
How do you work that?

34:55.001 --> 34:55.958

36:13.667 --> 36:15.126

- Do as you're told, be still.

47:47.876 --> 47:49.376
You don't know?

47:51.042 --> 47:54.167
If we weren't in eclipse,
we could call Central.

47:55.209 --> 47:57.709
And if we were chickens,
we could lay eggs.

47:57.709 --> 47:59.876
We're shadow locked.

47:59.876 --> 48:01.459
What do we do?

48:01.459 --> 48:03.542
Just sit and watch him
for three days?

48:21.292 --> 48:23.042
He's getting low on charge.

48:29.834 --> 48:31.376
<i>He's about to recharge.</i>

48:32.376 --> 48:33.542
Let him.

48:34.376 --> 48:36.751
- You can't let him recharge.
- Oh, yes we can.

48:36.751 --> 48:38.042
Alex.

48:40.167 --> 48:41.626
We'll overload him.

48:42.917 --> 48:45.126
I'm gonna give him
a headache he won't forget.

48:50.876 --> 48:51.834
Track it.

48:55.334 --> 48:56.292
<i>Track it.</i>

49:18.876 --> 49:21.167
I can't see.
I can't see it.

49:28.042 --> 49:29.292
[click]
Now.

50:00.792 --> 50:02.001
He's out.

50:02.001 --> 50:03.917
You'll have no more
trouble from him.

50:03.917 --> 50:05.792
Or from you.

50:05.792 --> 50:07.084
As soon a we declipse,

50:07.084 --> 50:10.251
I'm reporting your incompetent handling
of this whole experiment.

50:10.251 --> 50:12.376
<i>Where have you the right
to call me incompetent?</i>

50:12.376 --> 50:14.584
<i>You told me he could perform
those functions.</i>

50:14.584 --> 50:16.917
<i>- You told me you could hand--
- I did it on your say so!</i>

50:16.917 --> 50:18.126
<i>[Captain] You told me
you could handle it!</i>

50:18.126 --> 50:19.376
<i>[Major] You're the one
that put him together!</i>

50:19.376 --> 50:20.959
<i>- Is this the way you handle him?
- It's moving.</i>

50:23.417 --> 50:24.376
Hold him down.

50:25.001 --> 50:26.292
<i>[Captain]
Get his brain out!</i>

50:26.667 --> 50:28.001
Don't let go of his arm.

50:28.001 --> 50:28.959
Uh!

50:39.709 --> 50:40.876
Now.

50:58.709 --> 51:00.417
Dismantle it.

51:00.417 --> 51:02.376
<i>Piece by piece.</i>

51:02.376 --> 51:03.959
<i>And crate it.</i>

51:04.542 --> 51:07.167
Then take him and your ideas
back with you.

51:07.167 --> 51:11.251
What you can't stand
you run from.

51:11.251 --> 51:14.501
- Like you ran from Earth.
- That's right.

51:14.501 --> 51:16.584
To get away
from people like you.

51:17.042 --> 51:19.459
To set up your own
little universe?

51:20.376 --> 51:22.251
To help feed yours.

51:22.251 --> 51:24.959
And when you brought Alex here,
were you thinking just of her?

51:27.751 --> 51:30.501
Captain, you flunked.

51:36.292 --> 51:39.584
You want to kill me?
You want to kill me?

51:39.584 --> 51:40.792
Go ahead.

51:42.001 --> 51:44.167
Go ahead, kill me.

51:44.167 --> 51:45.459
Kill me.

51:45.459 --> 51:47.042
If you think you can.

51:49.376 --> 51:53.959
Did you know the original Hector
came to a tragic end?

51:55.792 --> 51:58.792
He was slain by Achilles.

51:58.792 --> 52:01.792
His body dragged
around the walls of Troy.

52:07.084 --> 52:08.584
You want the girl?

52:08.584 --> 52:12.542
Hm, sure, sure,
you want the girl.

52:13.501 --> 52:16.001
You think she's beautiful too,
don't you?

52:17.292 --> 52:19.417
You know the captain's crazy?

52:20.334 --> 52:22.459
He really is crazy.

52:22.459 --> 52:24.501
The robot scared me more.

52:26.626 --> 52:29.501
If the robot can kill,
the captain can kill.

52:31.876 --> 52:33.626
I thought I could kill.

52:35.667 --> 52:38.209
I'm just not update enough
for murder.

52:41.667 --> 52:43.417
I wish I was.

52:43.417 --> 52:45.501
Are you sure
he's taking it apart?

52:46.792 --> 52:49.626
Either he takes it apart
or it takes him apart.

52:56.167 --> 52:57.334
[beep]

52:57.334 --> 52:59.167
Captain, how are things
progressing?

53:01.084 --> 53:03.251
I have completed
the dismantling.

53:03.251 --> 53:04.334
[beep]

53:05.042 --> 53:06.667
Glad that's over.

55:49.167 --> 55:51.251
[bubbling]

56:39.751 --> 56:43.834
It's my fault, Alex.
I should never have let him stay.

56:43.834 --> 56:46.542
In a week or two we will have
forgotten it ever happened.

56:48.001 --> 56:50.209
- Will we?
- Of course we will.

57:02.126 --> 57:04.417
<i>[beep]
[whirring]</i>

57:13.376 --> 57:14.917
I'm leaving.

57:14.917 --> 57:17.751
I told you never
to barge in here.

57:17.751 --> 57:20.334
And I'm taking
your partner with me.

57:20.334 --> 57:21.584
[whispers]
What?

57:21.584 --> 57:23.209
You are crazy.

57:23.209 --> 57:24.667
Come along, Alex.

57:25.751 --> 57:28.501
I'm taking command.
You're inadequate, Major.

57:29.167 --> 57:30.667
<i>In every area.</i>

57:30.667 --> 57:32.417
Captain, for the last time.

57:32.417 --> 57:34.417
Doesn't it disgust you
to be used by him?

57:34.417 --> 57:35.876
<i>To be touched by an old man?</i>

57:35.876 --> 57:38.417
- Can't you feel the decay?
- Get out of here!

57:51.834 --> 57:53.959
Stop it!
Stop it!

57:54.709 --> 57:56.001
Stop it!

58:01.209 --> 58:02.459
[whispers]
It's me.

58:23.292 --> 58:24.417
Why did you stop me?

58:28.667 --> 58:29.626
Uh!

58:30.126 --> 58:31.876
- [screams]
- You're coming with me.

58:31.876 --> 58:33.001
Let me go!

58:33.001 --> 58:34.459
First thing we do is
go see Earth.

58:43.584 --> 58:44.751
[screaming]

58:51.251 --> 58:53.459
[groaning]

59:08.292 --> 59:11.251
Adam, how can we get
to the captain's ship?

59:12.209 --> 59:13.334
<i>[whispering]
We gotta be quick.</i>

59:14.251 --> 59:16.084
- Let's try.
- Now?

59:16.084 --> 59:17.167
Come on.

59:39.334 --> 59:42.792
<i>[tapping]</i>

59:56.042 --> 59:58.876
<i>[tapping]</i>

01:00:46.251 --> 01:00:48.876
[screaming]

01:01:54.417 --> 01:01:56.959
It's no use,
we can't lose him.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.459
[Hector whirring]

01:02:57.251 --> 01:02:58.292
<i>Alex?</i>

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.417
Alex.

01:03:51.042 --> 01:03:52.626
Adam.
[echoes]

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:54.834
Shh.

01:04:03.334 --> 01:04:04.959
Get back!
[echoes]

01:04:20.084 --> 01:04:21.542
Run for it!
[echoes]

01:05:03.292 --> 01:05:04.417
[gasps]

01:05:04.417 --> 01:05:06.209
Shh.

01:05:06.751 --> 01:05:08.126
[whispering]
Where is he?

01:05:09.126 --> 01:05:11.792
I don't know.
He just vanished.

01:05:23.459 --> 01:05:25.084
He's in the communications room.

01:05:27.917 --> 01:05:29.417
He's tracking us.

01:05:53.209 --> 01:05:54.417
[shattering]

01:07:12.751 --> 01:07:14.126
Come in, Hector.

01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:17.167
Come on.

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:19.709
Come on in.

01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:04.459
[whirring]

01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:04.876
- Are you sure you can fly it?
- No trouble.

01:09:04.876 --> 01:09:07.334
It'll be locked
into automatic return.

01:09:07.334 --> 01:09:09.876
All we have to do is light it up
and just sit back.

01:09:21.042 --> 01:09:23.292
[beeping]

01:09:42.626 --> 01:09:45.167
Eh, we know something.

01:09:45.167 --> 01:09:46.751
He doesn't want to kill us.

01:09:49.792 --> 01:09:52.417
Whatever he wants us for,

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:54.001
it's not for that.

01:10:09.876 --> 01:10:11.001
[beep]

01:10:26.792 --> 01:10:28.209
It's hopeless.

01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:39.292
You'll get your trip to Earth.

01:10:39.292 --> 01:10:41.084
I promise.

01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:51.959
The captain.

01:11:01.042 --> 01:11:02.751
He's alive?

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:04.751
<i>Yes, I'm alive.</i>

01:11:07.292 --> 01:11:10.751
Captain, what happened?

<i>Hector and I have come
to an arrangement.</i>

Where is the robot?

<i>How strange that
it ends like this.</i>

01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:43.251
How will it end, Captain?

01:11:45.209 --> 01:11:48.667
<i>You and I will come
to an arrangement.</i>

01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:50.292
<i>This way, please.</i>

<i>This way.</i>

<i>I trust you slept well.</i>

<i>What are you doing to me'?</i>

<i>Your program for the day
is very simple.</i>

Where is Alex?

<i>First you will restore
the damage to the laboratory.</i>

01:14:44.042 --> 01:14:46.709
What are you trying
to put in my head?

<i>Put in?
Put in?</i>

01:14:49.626 --> 01:14:52.667
<i>I'm not trying to put anything in.
That comes later.</i>

What have you done to her?

01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:12.167
Have you done
the same thing to her?

01:15:13.251 --> 01:15:15.001
<i>Good morning, Alex.</i>

01:15:15.001 --> 01:15:16.376
<i>I hope you slept well.</i>

<i>I'm happy to report

<i>We're just coming out of eclipse,

No, it's not me!

<i>I'm sure you will find
them profitable.</i>

01:17:04.292 --> 01:17:07.126
<i>And for the most part, painless.</i>

01:17:08.459 --> 01:17:10.251
<i>This way, please.</i>

01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:12.917
<i>Come along,
I don't want to force you.</i>

01:17:12.917 --> 01:17:15.334
<i>You could very quickly
become hungry,</i>

01:17:15.334 --> 01:17:18.251
<i>hot, cold,
or even breathless.</i>

01:17:28.626 --> 01:17:30.209
<i>Now, this way, please.</i>

01:17:38.084 --> 01:17:39.209
Adam?

01:17:48.001 --> 01:17:51.209
When I heard your voice,
I thought I was going mad.

01:17:54.209 --> 01:17:56.167
Oh, Alex.

01:17:57.751 --> 01:17:59.626
<i>Hurry along, please.</i>

01:18:03.626 --> 01:18:05.959
- Go on in there.
- Without you?

01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:09.751
I need a minute.

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:12.126
What's going to happen to us?

01:18:12.126 --> 01:18:13.667
Don't worry.

01:18:15.334 --> 01:18:17.042
<i>Hurry along!</i>

01:18:26.626 --> 01:18:27.751
[gasps]

01:18:30.834 --> 01:18:32.126
Go on.

01:19:09.542 --> 01:19:11.584
<i>[whirring]</i>

01:19:20.542 --> 01:19:25.001
[Major's voice] Ah, there you are,
and how beautiful.

01:19:25.001 --> 01:19:26.501
Come in, Alex.

01:19:26.501 --> 01:19:29.209
- Come in.
- Stop it, Hector.

01:19:29.751 --> 01:19:32.626
Hector, I never liked
that name.

01:19:32.626 --> 01:19:35.542
<i>Did you know that Hector
was slain by Achilles?</i>

01:19:35.542 --> 01:19:38.167
<i>His body dragged
around the walls of Troy.</i>

01:19:38.167 --> 01:19:41.251
<i>No, I never liked Hector.</i>

01:19:41.251 --> 01:19:45.042
<i>We can do better.
How about Adam?</i>

01:19:46.084 --> 01:19:48.876
Stop using his voice.

01:19:48.876 --> 01:19:50.209
[Captain's voice]
Forgive me.

01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:51.667
Is this more to your liking?

01:19:52.209 --> 01:19:54.001
[Alex's voice]
Or this perhaps.

01:19:54.001 --> 01:19:55.417
Stop it.

01:19:55.417 --> 01:19:56.917
Stop using us.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:59.251
[Captain's voice]
Well, you see my difficulty.

01:19:59.251 --> 01:20:02.001
<i>- [Alex's voice] I'm you.
- [Adam's voice] I'm Adam.</i>

01:20:02.001 --> 01:20:04.376
[all voices] I'm the other one.
I'm everyone.

01:20:04.876 --> 01:20:06.459
<i>Conversation's an art.</i>

01:20:06.459 --> 01:20:08.251
I do it to perfection.

01:20:10.334 --> 01:20:12.084
[Captain's voice]
There you are.

01:20:12.084 --> 01:20:14.126
<i>Don't be late again, Adam.</i>

01:20:15.251 --> 01:20:19.001
Major.
You will call me Major.

01:20:21.459 --> 01:20:23.376
I'm in command here.

01:20:24.376 --> 01:20:26.126
You will do as I say.

01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:28.376
Both of you.

01:20:28.376 --> 01:20:29.584
Stay where you are!

01:20:35.917 --> 01:20:40.209
It's time we programmed your brain
to be a bit more productive.

01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:44.459
Captain?

01:20:44.459 --> 01:20:46.917
Yes, that's who you really are.

01:20:46.917 --> 01:20:49.792
I'm not the captain.
I'm your superior.

01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:53.542
Adam, please.

01:20:53.542 --> 01:20:55.834
I told you to keep away!

01:20:56.834 --> 01:20:58.209
[Hector]
Don't do that!

01:21:00.584 --> 01:21:02.501
You must learn to obey.

01:21:04.834 --> 01:21:06.667
It's not your fault, Hector.

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:07.792
Turn around.

01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:15.542
It's not James' fault.

01:21:15.542 --> 01:21:16.834
<i>Turn around!</i>

01:21:23.251 --> 01:21:25.084
It's everybody's fault.

01:21:26.084 --> 01:21:28.459
Yeahh!

01:21:28.459 --> 01:21:30.417
[Hector]
No, no.

01:21:30.417 --> 01:21:34.709
Desist.
I <i>am</i> your superior...

01:23:06.292 --> 01:23:09.417
<i>[male] Hello there,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:12.876
<i>I trust you're enjoying
the ongoing flight situation</i>

01:23:12.876 --> 01:23:15.417
<i>and we hope you're gonna fly
World Spaceways</i>

01:23:15.417 --> 01:23:17.584
<i>again, and again, and again.</i>

01:23:17.584 --> 01:23:21.209
<i>Duty-free goods service
will be closing shortly.</i>

01:23:21.209 --> 01:23:24.584
<i>Right now, though,
I'd suggest you walk to the ports</i>

01:23:24.584 --> 01:23:28.001
<i>and get a good position
for a swell view of Mother Earth</i>

01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:30.292
<i>coming right up.</i>
