'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.120 --> 00:06.748
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:28.018 --> 00:31.479
Elliot Stabler, Sex Crimes. What happened?

00:31.521 --> 00:35.024
Vic is a Richard F Schiller, 42.

00:45.492 --> 00:49.496
- First time?
- Who the hell is that?

00:49.537 --> 00:53.291
Mrs Hayes, that's my partner,
Detective Stabler.

00:55.042 --> 00:58.712
- Welcome to my house.
- You all right?

01:00.589 --> 01:03.592
- She found the body.
- Wife, girlfriend, what?

01:03.634 --> 01:07.512
Landlord. She lives here
with her daughter, Virginia.

01:07.554 --> 01:10.640
- Where's the daughter?
- She's out.

01:10.682 --> 01:13.226
He was the best tenant.

01:13.267 --> 01:17.271
Clean. Quiet.
Always paid on time, early, even.

01:17.313 --> 01:20.274
Take Mrs Hayes downstairs.

01:20.316 --> 01:25.946
I'm here! Don't talk to me like
I'm not here. I'm not going anywhere.

01:25.987 --> 01:29.532
Actually, Mrs Hayes,
I could really use a cup of coffee.

01:33.995 --> 01:36.580
Anyone know what this guy's story is?

01:36.622 --> 01:39.375
He was a writer, according to the landlady.

01:40.751 --> 01:43.003
A writer, huh?

01:43.045 --> 01:46.173
Travel book, according to the landlady.

01:50.593 --> 01:54.138
Looks like he choked on his own words.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.478
Vietnam, Bosnia and Peru.

02:46.520 --> 02:50.523
- I heard Kosovo's beautiful.
- Look at this.

02:52.317 --> 02:56.946
It's good to know the macho
Hemingway ideal isn't entirely dead.

02:56.988 --> 03:00.366
- No. Still as toxic.
- On Schiller's last trip

03:00.407 --> 03:04.119
he rode his motorcycle
through a Chiapas uprising.

03:04.161 --> 03:07.998
That narrows down the reasons
for killing this accidental tourist.

03:08.039 --> 03:11.960
He could have been running drugs
or written the wrong thing.

03:12.001 --> 03:17.339
Don't think so.
'It was not the destination but the journey.'

03:17.381 --> 03:21.885
'It is the drive to keep moving
forward that propels me.'

03:21.927 --> 03:26.807
- One adverb shy of Robert James Waller.
- The Bridges Of Madison County?

03:26.848 --> 03:30.101
- That was incredible.
- How about incredibly banal?

03:30.143 --> 03:34.021
Short, muscular sentences
displaying absence of original thinking.

03:34.063 --> 03:37.650
- I was talking about the movie.
- What've you got?

03:37.691 --> 03:41.737
Clean record. No next of kin.
Divorced ten years.

03:41.779 --> 03:47.200
- Ex runs a tea-importing business.
- He rented that room for two years.

03:47.242 --> 03:50.954
He was an ideal tenant.
Never missed a payment.

03:50.995 --> 03:53.623
Do you think he can do that now?

03:53.664 --> 03:56.584
Time of death, early evening.

03:56.626 --> 03:59.170
No sign of forced entry.

03:59.211 --> 04:03.632
- COD from blunt-force trauma.
- And the weapon is where?

04:03.674 --> 04:07.427
- Still missing.
- But we do have these.

04:07.469 --> 04:12.557
Top of the line. Nice panties.
Schiller a he-she?

04:12.598 --> 04:17.185
- He was a writer.
- And the tape over the vic's mouth?

04:17.228 --> 04:19.688
No prints. No roll of the tape found.

04:19.730 --> 04:24.234
Taping the mouth shut and the panties
suggest a personal agenda.

04:24.276 --> 04:27.529
- To embarrass him!
- Or to shut him up.

04:27.571 --> 04:31.241
- How well did he know Mrs Hayes?
- How well did she know him?

04:31.282 --> 04:35.036
She was non compos mentis.
We'll talk to her today.

04:36.120 --> 04:40.082
OK, Munch, Cassidy,
track down Schiller's ex-wife.

04:46.129 --> 04:48.757
Mrs Hayes? We'd like to talk to you.

04:50.633 --> 04:56.097
Durst Publishing. One moment.

04:56.138 --> 05:00.559
- I can't leave this phone.
- It won't take very long.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.645
- Are you OK?
- Why wouldn't I be?

05:03.687 --> 05:07.524
- A lot happened last night.
- Huh! I'll say! Sorry.

05:07.566 --> 05:09.943
I'm worried about Virginia.

05:11.319 --> 05:15.323
- What time did she get home?
- She didn't.

05:15.364 --> 05:18.159
- Your daughter's missing?
- No.

05:18.200 --> 05:22.121
Durst Publishing. One moment.

05:22.162 --> 05:26.083
Give us a recent photo,
and we'll circulate it around.

05:26.124 --> 05:29.002
Whatever you want.

05:30.044 --> 05:32.839
Durst Publishing. One moment.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.384
- She's very pretty.
- Like mother, like daughter.

05:36.425 --> 05:39.595
Durst Publishing. Yes.

05:39.637 --> 05:43.765
Can you take us through
what happened last night?

05:43.807 --> 05:47.310
- OK. I came home.
- From where?

05:47.352 --> 05:50.980
From work.
And I was going through the mail.

05:51.022 --> 05:55.818
I saw a bill for Richard,
and I thought I'd take it up to him.

05:55.860 --> 05:58.362
So I went up there.

05:58.404 --> 06:01.156
I knocked, but there was no answer.

06:01.198 --> 06:04.868
Durst Publishing? One moment.

06:04.910 --> 06:07.871
When there was no answer,

06:07.913 --> 06:12.000
l-l opened the door,
and then I found him lying there.

06:12.041 --> 06:16.545
- How long have you rented the room?
- It's coming up on 11 years now.

06:16.587 --> 06:19.965
My ex-husband and I
bought it for our future.

06:20.007 --> 06:23.760
The tenants help cover
the mortgage payments.

06:23.802 --> 06:28.515
- Was Schiller dating anyone?
- He didn't bring anyone home.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.184
What was your relationship with him?

06:31.226 --> 06:33.770
- Did we sleep together?
- Yes.

06:33.811 --> 06:36.897
No.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.984
He was my tenant.
It was a business relationship.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.653
He had a fantastic credit rating.

06:42.694 --> 06:46.615
Durst Publishing. One moment.

06:46.656 --> 06:50.577
His editor is two floors up. John Freeman.

06:50.618 --> 06:54.205
I always thought
it would be foreign officials

06:54.247 --> 06:57.625
telling me all they'd found was a shoe.

06:57.666 --> 07:01.253
A lion, the rebels, a volcano got the rest.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.965
- The guy had a death wish?
- Please.

07:05.007 --> 07:09.344
- Thank you.
- He loved uncharted territory.

07:09.386 --> 07:14.265
He said, 'There's a shortage
of blank spaces on the map.'

07:14.307 --> 07:17.059
We'd just extended his contract.

07:17.101 --> 07:21.313
- What about Schiller and women?
- Honestly, he disliked baggage.

07:21.355 --> 07:24.441
He met so many different women.

07:24.483 --> 07:28.611
- Did you know him to solicit sex?
- No way. Nothing improper.

07:28.653 --> 07:31.614
He poured every cent into his trips.

07:31.656 --> 07:34.909
Any relationships that got out of hand?

07:34.951 --> 07:39.747
I can't think of anyone.
We were very open with each other.

07:39.788 --> 07:46.169
Richard had... This may sound corny,
but he had a real sense of honour.

07:46.211 --> 07:52.216
His writing is heartfelt, as were
his relationships. They ended well.

07:52.258 --> 07:55.178
His divorce ended in a hug.

07:57.763 --> 08:03.310
I last saw him a few months back,
when he came in for a special blend

08:03.352 --> 08:06.771
he'd had the last time he was in Morocco.

08:06.813 --> 08:10.942
When we first married,
he decided to settle down.

08:10.984 --> 08:13.528
No more travelling.

08:13.569 --> 08:19.783
Then I'd catch him secretly running
his fingers over the world atlas,

08:19.825 --> 08:22.995
like it was a Braille Penthouse.

08:24.830 --> 08:28.667
I prefer the Story Of O,
but I take your point.

08:28.708 --> 08:35.381
By the end, the very mention of a different
area code would spark a fight.

08:35.423 --> 08:38.342
Now I deal with ten different countries.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.678
Not all marriages end so well.

08:41.720 --> 08:47.184
We were better friends than lovers.
I wasn't the great love of his life.

08:47.225 --> 08:50.145
That's hard to believe.

08:50.186 --> 08:53.815
To us he's a naked corpse
with lingerie down his throat.

08:53.856 --> 08:56.400
Unnerving, isn't it?

08:56.442 --> 08:59.695
A degrading death
overshadows a remarkable life.

08:59.737 --> 09:03.031
Like Rockefeller dying
on top of his mistress.

09:03.073 --> 09:05.992
- It's my preferred way to go.
- And now?

09:06.034 --> 09:09.371
- We tackle his address book.
- Let's do it.

09:09.412 --> 09:13.791
Yes, Richard Schiller.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.669
Da, da. Schiller.

09:23.675 --> 09:28.513
- Gracias. Muchas gracias.
- Anything from Belize?

09:28.555 --> 09:34.310
A tamale maker who got a nice
mention in a book. Otherwise, nada.

09:34.352 --> 09:38.105
- How about the police in Berlin?
- Big fat nein.

09:38.147 --> 09:42.693
OK. Let's look at who's not in this book.

09:42.734 --> 09:45.654
Travellers have brief relationships.

09:45.695 --> 09:49.282
- He could have picked up a stranger.
- 27 got a call.

09:49.324 --> 09:54.787
The owner of a newsstand caught
a shoplifter called Virginia Hayes.

09:54.829 --> 09:58.332
- Santa Claus, there is a Virginia.
- Tell them we'll take it.

09:58.374 --> 10:00.334
I already did.

10:00.376 --> 10:03.462
She's all yours.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.591
I lose business with these people!

10:07.632 --> 10:10.760
Virginia Hayes? Come with us.

10:10.802 --> 10:13.513
Kids imaginate their own rules!

10:13.554 --> 10:17.975
- C'mon. Let's go.
- Hey! Who pays for my magazine?

10:21.478 --> 10:23.772
Here. Keep the change.

10:26.108 --> 10:29.903
I'm Detective Stabler
and this is Detective Benson.

10:29.944 --> 10:32.905
So you're not truant officers.

10:32.947 --> 10:38.410
- I'm looking for the Katonah train.
- I think it's the New Haven line.

10:38.452 --> 10:41.955
- Try Information.
- North Brewster line.

10:41.997 --> 10:44.916
Track 117. You got about five minutes.

10:44.958 --> 10:47.877
- Thanks.
- Whatever.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.715
Virginia, something happened
at home last night.

10:52.757 --> 10:54.842
Mom?

11:10.523 --> 11:13.818
It's Schilly. Schilly died.

11:13.860 --> 11:16.987
- My poor baby!
- You bitch!

11:17.029 --> 11:20.949
- You couldn't leave him alone!
- Virginia, calm down.

11:20.991 --> 11:23.827
Calm down.

11:29.749 --> 11:33.252
My mother was only faithful to the bottle.

11:33.294 --> 11:38.340
She drove my father away.
He didn't even have time to say goodbye.

11:38.382 --> 11:42.845
- But you and he?
- We were meant to meet at weekends.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.557
It's been his weekend for 10 years.

11:47.599 --> 11:50.226
I'm still waiting to be picked up.

11:50.268 --> 11:53.521
- Where were you last night?
- I went swimming.

11:53.563 --> 11:59.193
On my way home I got on the wrong train,
so I rode around for a while.

11:59.235 --> 12:01.945
You just decided to ride around?

12:01.987 --> 12:06.616
- 'The adventure begins with you.'
- That a Schiller line?

12:07.951 --> 12:11.412
- Did Schiller bring women home?
- No.

12:11.454 --> 12:16.042
The only thing Schiller brought home
was a small suitcase.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.794
- Did he get a break on the rent?
- No.

12:18.836 --> 12:22.047
She provided all modern conveniences.

12:22.089 --> 12:26.718
- So, they had a relationship?
- Do you mean with a capital 'R'

12:26.760 --> 12:30.263
- or little 'r' relationship?
- One that involves sex.

12:30.305 --> 12:32.724
Capital 'R' relationship.

12:32.765 --> 12:36.977
No. Schilly drove her crazy
because he never refused her directly.

12:37.019 --> 12:40.898
His manners kept her hopes up.
She's not used to polite men.

12:40.939 --> 12:43.442
What was their relationship like?

12:43.483 --> 12:46.653
Mom was jealous of Schilly,

12:46.695 --> 12:50.240
jealous of his life, his freedom.

12:50.281 --> 12:52.700
He wasn't saddled with a kid.

12:54.785 --> 12:58.831
This underwear look familiar to you?

12:58.873 --> 13:05.087
Mommy's. She wore the good stuff
when she wanted to get lucky.

13:05.128 --> 13:08.673
Fat lot of good it did her this time.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.557
Guys. This is Virginia.

13:18.599 --> 13:21.268
- Hiya, Ginny.
- Virginia!

13:22.895 --> 13:26.857
- The detectives will take you home.
- Can I drive?

13:26.898 --> 13:30.318
- Same age as my partner. Why not?
- What?

13:30.360 --> 13:32.612
Cool!

13:32.654 --> 13:34.822
She's tough.

13:34.864 --> 13:38.784
She's like Maureen. Drama's a major
food group for teenage girls.

13:40.369 --> 13:45.624
- Seven tenants in five years.
- Only one still left in Manhattan.

13:49.252 --> 13:55.633
Constantly touching me. Even when
I asked to be alone, she bothered me.

13:55.675 --> 14:00.846
Dropping off mail, leaving cookies
and milk. I'm lactose intolerant.

14:00.888 --> 14:03.932
Were you ever involved with her?

14:03.974 --> 14:06.518
No! No, no, no!

14:06.560 --> 14:09.521
How did she react when you said no?

14:09.562 --> 14:14.317
I had a friend come home,
pretend she was my girlfriend.

14:14.358 --> 14:17.153
Mrs Hayes tore into us.

14:17.194 --> 14:21.407
She threw my friend out and
then she literally read me the lease.

14:21.448 --> 14:24.951
- 'No overnight guests.'
- Why did you stay?

14:24.993 --> 14:27.412
I was in grad school. I was broke.

14:27.454 --> 14:31.457
It's like when I travel.
I'd rather stay in a hotel

14:31.499 --> 14:34.418
than one of those charming B&Bs.

14:34.460 --> 14:39.423
I prefer anonymity. Solitude.
I hate making small talk

14:39.465 --> 14:42.509
over tiny blueberry muffins.

14:47.764 --> 14:50.642
Do you know how Mr Schiller died,
Mrs Hayes?

14:50.683 --> 14:55.104
His mouth was taped shut,
and he looked ready to hit a home run.

14:55.146 --> 14:58.858
When you came home,
no one else was here?

14:58.899 --> 15:01.527
No. I told you no before.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.196
What are you getting at?

15:04.237 --> 15:08.616
When you found the body,
did you touch it in any way?

15:08.658 --> 15:13.913
Oh, yeah! I collected next month's rent.
Of course I didn't.

15:13.955 --> 15:19.543
Then explain how a pair of lacy
underwear was found in his mouth.

15:19.585 --> 15:25.173
I have no idea. Maybe it was some
weird sex thing. I don't know.

15:25.215 --> 15:29.219
- Did he ever take your underwear?
- Who said they were mine?

15:31.721 --> 15:37.393
Not that I know of. But how well
do you ever really know someone?

15:37.435 --> 15:42.564
The underpants didn't just
magically appear in his throat.

15:42.606 --> 15:45.358
Maybe they crawled down.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.570
You were angry
because Schiller wasn't interested.

15:48.611 --> 15:52.573
- I wasn't.
- Angry he'd kept his hands off you.

15:52.615 --> 15:55.076
- You wanted more.
- No.

15:55.117 --> 15:57.995
There was a time, yes. But...

15:58.037 --> 16:02.708
Now I have a boyfriend.
At least, I think I do.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.586
- A boyfriend?
- Tom.

16:06.628 --> 16:12.342
He works in a department store.
Gets me a great deal on underwear.

16:12.383 --> 16:17.138
- When was the last time you saw Tom?
- Last night.

16:20.015 --> 16:22.976
We er... we met for drinks.

16:24.061 --> 16:28.982
Had a fight. About Schiller, of all things.

16:29.024 --> 16:33.277
He thought that there was
something going on between us.

16:33.319 --> 16:38.449
- Why didn't you say this before?
- Tom once told me he loved me.

16:38.491 --> 16:40.993
That's worth a lot.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.665
- You think he did this?
- I hope not.

16:48.667 --> 16:52.712
- You two met for drinks, er, where?
- Julian's Bistro.

16:52.754 --> 16:56.465
65 St Mark's. About six.

16:56.507 --> 16:59.510
Can you give us Tom's full name?

17:01.637 --> 17:04.306
Thomas Dayton.

17:04.348 --> 17:09.477
Tom Dayton's a happy hour regular.
Nice guy, only he brought a date.

17:09.519 --> 17:13.522
- Why's that memorable?
- They had a blow-up about my tip.

17:13.564 --> 17:16.776
She wanted to leave more.
He wanted to leave less.

17:16.817 --> 17:20.904
All of a sudden, she loved him more.
He loved her less. Anything else?

17:20.945 --> 17:24.366
- I stayed out of it.
- Did they leave together?

17:24.407 --> 17:28.494
No. She nursed some Manhattans.
She was better off without him.

17:28.536 --> 17:32.790
Women are always better off
left to their own mechanical devices.

17:32.832 --> 17:35.376
Sure you know what I mean.

17:36.502 --> 17:40.714
Uh-huh. Yeah. That's him over there.
You're welcome.

17:40.756 --> 17:44.676
- Tom Dayton?
- Do I know you?

17:44.718 --> 17:48.263
Detectives Benson and Stabler,
Special Victims Unit.

17:48.305 --> 17:52.350
- It's about Richard Schiller.
- How long have you dated Mrs Hayes?

17:52.392 --> 17:57.855
- Seven months. She's really serious.
- And you?

17:57.897 --> 18:02.234
Loving someone who expected more
of life is a big responsibility.

18:02.276 --> 18:05.737
I'm not sure I'm ready
to be a father to a teenager.

18:05.779 --> 18:08.531
- You never are.
- You have kids?

18:08.573 --> 18:10.992
- Yeah.
- Lucky man. Teenagers.

18:11.034 --> 18:15.705
I know their fashion sense.
I have to, it's my job.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.998
But Virginia's hard to read.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.794
Mrs Hayes said you and she
had a fight the night Schiller died.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.796
It was about Schiller, like all our fights.

18:24.838 --> 18:27.215
Do you think they had an affair?

18:27.257 --> 18:30.635
Nah. He was packing for his next big trip.

18:30.677 --> 18:34.305
She kept talking about him. I overreacted.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.891
I don't have proof of anything.

18:36.932 --> 18:40.644
- Where'd you go after that?
- I came home. Alone.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.480
- Anybody see you?
- The doorman.

18:43.522 --> 18:48.610
I was tired. I'm doing a lot of overtime.
Homecoming, you know.

18:48.652 --> 18:51.154
Yeah, I know.

18:51.196 --> 18:56.826
They have a fight. Dayton goes to
the Hayes house and kills Schiller.

18:56.867 --> 19:01.914
It'd make more sense,
if Dayton's strong enough to take him on.

19:01.955 --> 19:05.959
Why didn't Mrs Hayes
tell us about Tom Dayton before?

19:06.001 --> 19:10.088
Haven't you ever tried
to protect someone you love?

19:19.346 --> 19:21.974
Hey! That's mine.

19:22.015 --> 19:25.602
- Dad? It's for you.
- Stabler.

19:27.312 --> 19:30.899
Yeah. OK, I'll meet you there. Bye-bye.

19:31.983 --> 19:35.361
- You go. I'll see you for dessert.
- Yeah.

19:35.403 --> 19:38.656
- Sure you will.
- OK. You know the drill.

19:38.697 --> 19:40.824
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

19:40.866 --> 19:45.203
Have you washed your hands?
Good one. Love you. Love you!

19:46.746 --> 19:50.208
- Love you.
- No, Dad. Not on the lips.

19:53.878 --> 19:57.923
- When did that happen?
- When you were at work.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.889
He's dead.

20:06.932 --> 20:09.893
Thomas Dayton. Died in '87.

20:09.934 --> 20:13.062
I wonder if Thomas had a sibling.

20:14.605 --> 20:17.024
Right there, older brother Scott.

20:17.066 --> 20:22.905
Scott seems to have borrowed
his brother's social security number.

20:26.491 --> 20:29.369
Scott Dayton.

20:29.411 --> 20:32.497
Convicted two counts child molestation.

20:32.538 --> 20:35.666
October 1990, Seattle.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.835
He liked to work with his hands.

20:37.877 --> 20:41.630
It wasn't Mrs Hayes
he wanted to keep to himself.

20:41.672 --> 20:43.966
It was Virginia.

20:47.177 --> 20:51.931
All right now. See? We just pull this up,
take that in. See how it looks?

20:51.973 --> 20:54.433
- Yeah.
- That's a great colour.

20:54.475 --> 20:57.395
You know
where we might find Scott Dayton?

20:58.646 --> 21:01.148
- You all right?
- Yeah! Get him.

21:15.828 --> 21:20.332
- I was just trying to do my job.
- Exactly what we were afraid of.

21:28.673 --> 21:31.968
- 'I hear you have quite an eye.'
- 'I enjoy my job.'

21:32.010 --> 21:36.180
'I bet! Back to school's probably
your favourite time of year, huh?

21:36.222 --> 21:38.974
'All those poodle skirts.'

21:39.016 --> 21:41.185
I work hard to meet tight budgets,

21:41.226 --> 21:43.895
to make an awkward teenager look her best.

21:43.937 --> 21:46.773
I bet you suggest a lot of alterations.

21:46.815 --> 21:48.650
- They're often needed.
- Please!

21:48.692 --> 21:52.195
I was trained as a dressmaker.
It's what I'm good at.

21:52.236 --> 21:54.906
You give it that personal touch, huh?

21:54.947 --> 21:57.616
Yes. It involves touching.

21:57.658 --> 22:01.995
Any touching at all, regardless of
my history, is taboo in this country.

22:02.037 --> 22:04.539
I guess Mrs Hayes is
one of those crazy women

22:04.581 --> 22:08.418
who doesn't run background checks
on boyfriends. Does she know?

22:08.460 --> 22:13.005
- Know what? I didn't kill...
- That you're a convicted paedophile.

22:14.757 --> 22:15.925
No.

22:17.885 --> 22:20.262
On my release, I wanted a clean start,

22:20.304 --> 22:24.349
which, as a convicted sex offender,
you can never have.

22:24.391 --> 22:28.520
And when I met Annabel,
I honestly thought we had a chance.

22:28.561 --> 22:32.023
We have a normal sex life.
Three times a week.

22:32.065 --> 22:36.402
Every time you thought of Annabel's
daughter. What d'you do to her?

22:36.444 --> 22:38.112
I never touched Ginny.

22:38.154 --> 22:40.197
- Virginia!
- I control my impulses.

22:40.239 --> 22:42.282
- I had therapy.
- You touched her.

22:42.324 --> 22:46.036
Even if I'd wanted to,
which I didn't, I never had the chance.

22:46.077 --> 22:48.246
What do you mean?

22:48.288 --> 22:50.623
I mean the two of them.

22:50.665 --> 22:53.668
They'd sit at the dinner table,
flanking Schiller,

22:53.709 --> 22:56.837
tossing their hair and gabbing at him.

22:56.879 --> 23:00.424
An attention-getting contest.
Virginia and her mother.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.926
And Virginia won.

23:02.968 --> 23:06.263
What you're saying is
Schiller was the paedophile.

23:06.304 --> 23:07.973
Yes. Definitely.

23:09.391 --> 23:11.684
Schiller?

23:11.726 --> 23:14.395
I saw the way he'd look at her.

23:14.437 --> 23:17.023
And I know that look.

23:18.149 --> 23:22.111
- And that made you jealous.
- And you did something about it.

23:22.152 --> 23:25.447
He kept chatting her up
so you decided to shut his mouth.

23:25.489 --> 23:28.325
I didn't touch Virginia or kill Schiller.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.869
- You lied to Annabel!
- I'm different now!

23:30.910 --> 23:33.996
Who gets jealous
of the affections of a little girl.

23:34.038 --> 23:37.917
Why not ask Annabel to marry you?
Make Virginia Daddy's little girl!

23:37.958 --> 23:40.127
Elliot!

23:40.878 --> 23:44.673
- Sometimes enough is enough.
- No, it's not. It never is.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.467
Dayton pulled his life around, got a job.

23:47.509 --> 23:51.054
- In the juniors' department.
- It's hard to change career.

23:51.095 --> 23:54.182
We have no hard evidence
Dayton did anything.

23:54.223 --> 23:57.560
He steals his dead brother's
social security card,

23:57.601 --> 23:59.603
he evades his parole officer.

23:59.645 --> 24:02.523
This guy will lie to his last breath!

24:02.564 --> 24:05.859
Why shift blame to Schiller?
It's for what he's feeling!

24:05.901 --> 24:08.194
Y'know, I'm getting a headache.

24:08.236 --> 24:11.948
We have a convicted paedophile
saying he didn't molest anybody,

24:11.990 --> 24:14.659
and a dead guy, not a paedophile,
who might have.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.535
Maybe Dayton told the truth.

24:16.577 --> 24:19.538
Why? Cos paedophiles
are always so honest?

24:21.957 --> 24:24.960
Ask the girl. Where is she now?

24:36.762 --> 24:38.639
Over there.

24:45.020 --> 24:46.438
Hi.

24:49.899 --> 24:52.610
Whenever Mr Dayton stayed with my mom,

24:52.652 --> 24:57.615
he'd come into my room late at night,
when she'd fallen asleep,

24:57.656 --> 25:00.743
or when she passed out,
whichever came first.

25:01.368 --> 25:06.164
He would come to me... when
he didn't get what he wanted from her.

25:07.207 --> 25:09.501
I'd pretend I was asleep.

25:11.169 --> 25:13.463
But he always woke me up.

25:16.799 --> 25:19.927
Virginia. I know this is hard,

25:19.969 --> 25:22.012
but we need to know.

25:22.846 --> 25:24.765
Did he force you to touch him?

25:28.476 --> 25:30.061
That's not all, is it?

25:33.398 --> 25:35.483
Oral sex?

25:41.196 --> 25:43.073
Intercourse?

25:48.078 --> 25:52.248
I finally asked him to stop.
That's when Richard heard us.

25:54.125 --> 25:56.961
And a few nights before he died,

25:57.002 --> 26:01.423
Richard came into the room
and shoved him off of me and...

26:02.257 --> 26:06.636
Richard said that if he caught him
in my room again, he'd kill him.

26:07.679 --> 26:10.390
You came home that night, didn't you?

26:12.684 --> 26:14.352
Yeah.

26:15.186 --> 26:18.105
I found Richard
and I knew what had happened.

26:18.147 --> 26:20.774
He died trying to protect me. I freaked out.

26:21.650 --> 26:25.404
I ran to the train station
and I stayed there all night,

26:25.445 --> 26:29.783
watching the board
that posts arrivals and departures.

26:29.824 --> 26:32.702
I just wanted to leave so, so bad.

26:33.536 --> 26:35.621
Why didn't you?

26:38.124 --> 26:41.376
I didn't have anybody to go to.

26:41.418 --> 26:45.005
Your mom says
sometimes you borrow her clothes.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.632
Mm. The underwear.

26:48.550 --> 26:52.512
- Were you wearing them that day?
- Hm.

26:52.553 --> 26:54.972
Mom hates it when I do.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.725
But I dunno. It's so nice.

26:58.851 --> 27:02.688
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I didn't want to get in trouble.

27:03.563 --> 27:05.107
I...

27:05.148 --> 27:08.360
I hid them in the hamper after my shower.

27:08.401 --> 27:12.113
- When did you find Schiller's body?
- After my shower.

27:12.155 --> 27:15.866
- Approximately what time?
- I don't know.

27:17.535 --> 27:18.994
Six.

27:21.371 --> 27:23.457
What position was the body in?

27:30.880 --> 27:33.382
I always said hello after swimming.

27:34.425 --> 27:36.052
I swim and I swim,

27:36.093 --> 27:37.970
and I take 40-hour showers

27:38.012 --> 27:40.264
and I never feel clean!

27:49.189 --> 27:52.108
People like Dayton are habitual.
Ticking clocks.

27:52.150 --> 27:56.070
- It was only a matter of time.
- I'm sorry it had to be Virginia.

27:56.112 --> 27:58.572
We have enough to hold him.

28:00.699 --> 28:03.160
After I make a new copy of this.

28:03.201 --> 28:06.788
Uniformed officers checked the house.
Found no weapon.

28:06.830 --> 28:09.249
He had plenty of time to get rid of it.

28:09.290 --> 28:13.002
Why didn't Virginia tell us
upfront about the underwear?

28:13.044 --> 28:17.882
- She said she didn't want trouble.
- She didn't remember the body.

28:17.923 --> 28:20.884
She sees he's dead,
adrenaline rush kicks in.

28:20.926 --> 28:26.681
You never forget! I ask about the body,
she starts up the tear factory.

28:26.723 --> 28:29.350
- What did you expect?
- A straight answer?

28:29.392 --> 28:30.602
What's going on?

28:30.643 --> 28:33.271
Anyone who's seen a Tori Spelling movie

28:33.312 --> 28:35.940
could have given the same performance.

28:35.982 --> 28:39.276
I would think you of all people
would be on her side.

28:39.318 --> 28:43.155
Every scenario
has different interpretations, OK?

28:43.196 --> 28:47.450
Let's try this one on.
Virginia fled the scene of the crime.

28:47.492 --> 28:51.329
- She was scared.
- And OJ Simpson likes an afternoon drive.

28:51.371 --> 28:53.581
Same facts, different interpretation.

28:53.623 --> 28:56.584
If you need more time with the menu,
I can come back.

28:56.625 --> 29:00.379
Schiller had sex just before he was killed.

29:00.421 --> 29:02.798
ME's found secretions on him.

29:02.839 --> 29:06.343
- And what about on the underwear?
- A match.

29:06.384 --> 29:08.470
Tom Dayton never touched her.

29:09.220 --> 29:13.182
- Virginia and Schiller.
- 'Fraid so.

29:14.517 --> 29:17.645
- He raped her.
- There's another possibility.

29:18.270 --> 29:23.066
- Virginia was aroused.
- OK. A couple of scenarios.

29:23.108 --> 29:26.236
One. Mother walked in,
flew into a rage, killed him.

29:26.278 --> 29:29.781
Two. Mother's boyfriend walks in,
rage, kills him.

29:29.823 --> 29:33.951
- Three. Virginia flew into a rage, killed him.
- No.

29:33.993 --> 29:37.079
Everybody has their breaking point.

29:45.378 --> 29:49.132
No way do you talk to her again.
Filling her head with garbage...

29:49.174 --> 29:52.844
Fine. 8:00am tomorrow
we want to see you, your daughter,

29:52.885 --> 29:55.388
and your lawyer down at the station.

29:58.516 --> 30:03.312
Tell me, Virginia, does killing a man
make you feel all grown-up?

30:08.108 --> 30:12.487
- Maureen has a boyfriend.
- Probably kisses him on the lips.

30:13.738 --> 30:17.491
- Do we know who he is?
- Jim. Jim Delmonico.

30:18.951 --> 30:22.079
- Little Jimmy?
- Little Jimmy is six foot

30:22.121 --> 30:24.581
with a voice to match.

30:24.623 --> 30:28.501
He's a junior. Fullback, first string.

30:28.543 --> 30:31.504
And he's asked our daughter
to homecoming.

30:31.546 --> 30:33.548
Little Jimmy's a junior!

30:33.589 --> 30:38.052
Hm. You'll probably run into him.
They do a lot of studying together.

30:38.093 --> 30:40.220
Oh, no, no, no.

30:40.262 --> 30:42.556
El! Relax.

30:48.770 --> 30:51.272
Has Maureen had sex yet, do you know?

30:51.314 --> 30:53.357
God, I hope not.

30:55.651 --> 30:58.571
I wonder how we will know.

30:58.612 --> 31:00.447
If we'll know.

31:02.115 --> 31:04.618
No. Hey, Munch, she's a child.

31:04.659 --> 31:07.078
The appeal goes beyond a midlife crisis.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.622
The way her top shows her flat stomach.

31:09.664 --> 31:12.542
The mature discussions
about the Backstreet Boys.

31:12.583 --> 31:15.419
Everyone knows
women mature faster than men.

31:15.461 --> 31:20.716
True, a good Mrs Robinson is hard to find,
but women maturing faster? Conspiracy.

31:20.758 --> 31:24.678
The government's been covering up
the side effects of RBGH,

31:24.720 --> 31:27.764
a hormone that farmers use
to produce more milk.

31:27.806 --> 31:31.559
Like, erm, McGuire taking creatine
to bulk up, right?

31:31.601 --> 31:34.437
Farmers don't take it, Cassidy.
The cows do.

31:34.478 --> 31:38.399
Is there anything you just accept?

31:39.024 --> 31:41.777
- Yeah.
- Stabler.

31:41.819 --> 31:45.822
- Compliments.
- No wonder you're so sceptical.

31:45.864 --> 31:50.243
We'll be down. Virginia's in the hospital.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.578
She tried to commit suicide.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.877
- When was she admitted?
- About 7:00 this morning.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.546
Luckily, she only cut one wrist.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.549
- She gonna be OK?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.176
Fortunately, she didn't lose much blood.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.845
Doesn't sound like a serious attempt.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.930
Serious enough.

32:12.972 --> 32:17.226
In my experience, teenagers
wanting more than attention usually die.

32:19.478 --> 32:23.023
It's your fault. I've lost
the most important thing in my life.

32:23.065 --> 32:25.734
Mrs Hayes, Virginia will be fine.

32:25.776 --> 32:28.111
I meant Thomas!

32:28.153 --> 32:30.947
- You poisoned him against me.
- Easy!

32:30.989 --> 32:33.658
You self-important bitch!

32:38.829 --> 32:41.331
Mother's threatening to sue.

32:41.373 --> 32:46.002
- Lost wages, hospital bills.
- Add a few zeros for a broken heart.

32:46.044 --> 32:47.629
Mother's an alcoholic.

32:47.671 --> 32:52.008
Which won't justify you tearing into a girl.
Where were the kid gloves?

32:52.050 --> 32:55.386
- If she was a kid, I would have used them.
- She is a kid!

32:55.428 --> 32:59.723
Chronologically. But Virginia Hayes
is no child. Probably not a victim.

32:59.765 --> 33:03.018
- And Mrs Hayes?
- Drunks are victims in their minds.

33:03.060 --> 33:06.354
There was a relationship
between Virginia and Schiller?

33:06.396 --> 33:07.606
- Right?
- No.

33:07.647 --> 33:08.898
- Yes.
- Come on!

33:08.940 --> 33:11.150
- We don't know.
- They had sex!

33:11.192 --> 33:14.153
She tried to kill herself. She's overwhelmed.

33:14.195 --> 33:15.863
Or she was cornered!

33:15.905 --> 33:18.616
- You think she killed him?
- I do!

33:18.657 --> 33:23.287
- I'm not ready to take that leap.
- Do I hear self-defence?

33:26.456 --> 33:29.542
Look, we're gonna
have to work this out, OK?

33:29.584 --> 33:33.504
So, erm, once we get that
taken care of, we will call you.

33:33.546 --> 33:35.590
I can't wait.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.302
Neither can I.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.139
The mom had a revolving door
of boyfriends.

33:44.181 --> 33:48.518
Virginia learnt at an early age
that men were just a commodity.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.728
That, and as arcane as it sounds,

33:50.770 --> 33:55.191
there is truth in the notion
every girl wants to marry her father.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.276
Most of them outgrow it.

33:57.860 --> 33:59.737
When a father's absent,

33:59.778 --> 34:04.366
it's not unusual for a younger girl
to be attracted to an older man.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.285
That's what this is about?

34:08.119 --> 34:10.371
It happens more than you think.

34:10.413 --> 34:12.498
How old were you?

34:14.167 --> 34:16.502
- Almost 17.
- And he was?

34:17.545 --> 34:20.839
Older than 17.
About as old as I am now.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.967
And I tell you,
I couldn't have loved him more.

34:24.009 --> 34:27.344
However you view it,
it's an unequal relationship.

34:27.387 --> 34:31.474
Being in love?
That does not absolve an affair.

34:31.516 --> 34:34.185
I'm not saying that love is an excuse.

34:34.226 --> 34:38.355
I'm saying that soul mates
come in all shapes and sizes and ages.

34:38.397 --> 34:41.442
- Soul mates? Come on, Olivia.
- Elliot!

34:41.483 --> 34:45.654
She didn't remember the position
of the body, Have you ever seen that?

34:47.822 --> 34:52.409
- What are you trying to protect?
- Her. I'm trying to protect her.

34:52.452 --> 34:54.786
No. It's your daughter. You can't.

34:54.829 --> 34:57.123
Don't bring her into this.

34:58.082 --> 35:00.918
Maureen! You look terrific.

35:00.959 --> 35:02.753
You look great.

35:02.794 --> 35:04.838
Just one more. One more.

35:07.340 --> 35:09.968
- Hey!
- What's up?

35:10.009 --> 35:13.304
- Nothing.
- For you.

35:15.890 --> 35:18.475
Thank you. Mom?

35:21.478 --> 35:25.065
OK. Let's have a picture
by the fireplace, you two.

35:25.690 --> 35:28.610
Sweetheart, can you get out of the picture?

35:30.486 --> 35:32.780
OK. One more.

35:33.865 --> 35:37.368
- Mom, we do have to go. So, stop!
- Oh, yeah. OK.

35:37.410 --> 35:39.453
Say good night to him.

35:40.287 --> 35:42.581
You look great.

35:42.623 --> 35:44.875
Right. Have fun.

35:44.916 --> 35:48.003
- Night, Jimmy.
- You look beautiful, honey.

35:57.595 --> 35:59.680
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

36:00.347 --> 36:02.808
- Don't wait up for me.
- Yeah, right.

36:18.197 --> 36:21.158
- Virginia?
- I'm upstairs.

36:32.126 --> 36:34.003
You wanted to talk to us?

36:37.339 --> 36:40.551
Thomas Dayton never touched you,
did he?

36:40.592 --> 36:44.137
Tom. No. He didn't.

36:44.179 --> 36:46.473
It was Schiller? He raped you?

36:50.560 --> 36:55.564
Tell us. It changes everything
if Schiller sexually assaulted you.

36:59.610 --> 37:02.029
I wouldn't call it assault.

37:03.071 --> 37:06.700
We need to hear it in your words, Virginia.

37:06.741 --> 37:09.285
How did it start?

37:09.327 --> 37:13.331
Schiller would tell Mom and me
stories about his travels.

37:13.372 --> 37:16.584
We'd sit up late at night in the kitchen,

37:16.625 --> 37:22.172
listening about places
that had names like Kuala Lumpur

37:22.214 --> 37:24.508
and Burkina Faso.

37:24.549 --> 37:26.468
When did it get sexual, Virginia?

37:26.510 --> 37:28.553
July 17th.

37:29.345 --> 37:32.807
It was raining. Mom wasn't home.

37:32.849 --> 37:37.478
Schiller and I ordered Ethiopian food.
It was delicious.

37:37.520 --> 37:40.981
- And then what happened?
- I kissed him.

37:41.023 --> 37:44.234
- That's how it started.
- He coerced you?

37:44.276 --> 37:47.279
No. We couldn't help ourselves.

37:47.320 --> 37:51.532
I had never felt that... pull before.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.370
It's every man's fantasy, right?

37:56.412 --> 37:59.581
Having some young girl want him?

38:02.501 --> 38:07.088
But it was so much more than that.
For the first time in my life,

38:07.130 --> 38:10.425
making love... felt natural.

38:11.050 --> 38:12.927
Felt good.

38:13.553 --> 38:15.471
For the first time, I felt safe.

38:17.473 --> 38:20.809
- How long did it continue?
- Months.

38:20.851 --> 38:25.021
When he was home,
he made this house bearable.

38:25.856 --> 38:29.609
When he would leave,
I didn't think I'd make it without him.

38:31.694 --> 38:33.988
I cried every night he was gone.

38:34.030 --> 38:40.452
When he came back, he promised
he'd never leave me behind again.

38:41.286 --> 38:44.039
When he was out, I would read his mail.

38:44.081 --> 38:48.168
And saw that he was gonna leave again.
For Romania this time.

38:48.209 --> 38:50.670
- And?
- I packed my bag.

38:50.712 --> 38:53.381
I wanted him to take me with him.

38:53.423 --> 38:55.675
He was sitting right there.

38:59.678 --> 39:01.305
Tell me.

39:07.352 --> 39:09.813
Tell me what happened.

39:09.854 --> 39:11.731
I did

39:13.191 --> 39:15.067
what he liked.

39:16.110 --> 39:18.195
What's that?

39:19.863 --> 39:23.200
I got on his lap. The chair leans back.

39:25.494 --> 39:27.579
And when we were finished,

39:28.246 --> 39:32.166
I leaned close
and asked him to take me away.

39:32.208 --> 39:34.043
'You promised.'

39:35.920 --> 39:38.214
What did he say?

39:38.255 --> 39:40.549
He said he needed to travel light.

39:41.341 --> 39:45.137
And I knew I couldn't stay
another day here without him.

39:47.847 --> 39:51.100
Something broke inside me.

39:53.436 --> 39:57.898
I didn't think. I put my knee on his throat
and I held it there.

39:59.817 --> 40:04.988
He made this wet, hissing sound.
He couldn't talk.

40:10.535 --> 40:12.620
And when he was still,

40:13.496 --> 40:17.833
I picked up my underwear
from the floor and I put it in his mouth.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.463
And I left.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.010
He had this drive,

40:29.052 --> 40:32.221
this... impulse to travel.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.558
Like you.

40:37.643 --> 40:40.562
He'd always promised to take me away,

40:40.604 --> 40:43.273
to a place where he would love me.

40:44.316 --> 40:48.028
And I just wanted so badly to leave this life.

40:48.069 --> 40:50.363
Oh! I miss him!

41:02.207 --> 41:05.168
Yeah?

41:07.045 --> 41:09.547
- Tough day.
- Hm.

41:13.926 --> 41:17.430
They're arraigning Virginia in the morning.

41:17.471 --> 41:19.640
ADA's going for man two.

41:21.016 --> 41:23.101
You OK with that?

41:27.272 --> 41:28.982
Talk to me.

41:30.066 --> 41:33.528
I have a child a little younger than Virginia.

41:35.196 --> 41:38.741
When she was born,
I used to take her to the playground

41:38.782 --> 41:41.660
and the grocery store, whatever.

41:44.162 --> 41:47.707
But it wasn't her
that I would watch, obsessively.

41:48.958 --> 41:53.754
It was the men. All around.
To protect her from what they might do.

41:54.797 --> 41:57.299
- Elliot...
- The other night, erm,

41:58.342 --> 42:01.345
her date comes to pick her up.

42:01.386 --> 42:05.307
And all I'm thinking is,
what is this guy gonna do to her?

42:05.348 --> 42:07.309
I know.

42:07.350 --> 42:09.811
I made a mistake today.

42:12.313 --> 42:14.190
I didn't see it.

42:15.024 --> 42:17.443
Olivia saw it.

42:17.485 --> 42:19.820
You got too wrapped up.

42:21.280 --> 42:24.199
I saw that girl like I saw my daughter.

42:25.450 --> 42:27.535
As a victim.

42:27.577 --> 42:31.706
Not as someone capable of... acting,

42:33.374 --> 42:35.251
or feeling,

42:36.293 --> 42:38.504
loving on their own.

42:40.464 --> 42:45.052
Your daughter caring for someone
doesn't mean she loves you any less.

42:45.093 --> 42:49.722
- I know that.
- You wanna be the only man in her life.

42:51.307 --> 42:53.309
No.

42:57.897 --> 42:59.356
Sort of.

43:01.316 --> 43:05.403
Elliot, your feelings will always be
a part of your police work.

43:05.445 --> 43:08.406
- Yeah. But...
- The more you try to deny that,

43:08.448 --> 43:11.200
the more control they will have over you.

43:11.242 --> 43:16.706
We work with different permutations
of sex all day, sometimes all night.

43:16.747 --> 43:19.458
Don't worry when you feel something.

43:20.292 --> 43:22.920
Worry when you don't.
