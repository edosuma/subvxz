00:10.368 --> 00:13.537
Oh, come on.

00:13.538 --> 00:15.013
Not your day there, Cleary.

00:15.014 --> 00:17.908
All right, all right, all right.

00:17.909 --> 00:20.911
Here's the deal... I get a bull's-eye

00:20.912 --> 00:24.631
and Quinn buys a round.

00:24.632 --> 00:25.865
The day you get a bull's-eye, Cleary,

00:25.866 --> 00:27.366
is the day I suck off a horse.

00:29.786 --> 00:33.038
All right, fuck the pint.

00:33.039 --> 00:34.956
You're on.

00:38.378 --> 00:41.797
Yeah!

00:41.798 --> 00:44.299
Somebody find us a horny stallion!

00:44.300 --> 00:46.635
Open up, Quinn. Come on, open up.

00:46.636 --> 00:49.771
Come here. Hey, you forgot your hat.

00:54.727 --> 00:57.112
- He thought I was serious.
- Weren't you?

00:57.113 --> 01:00.315
I'd have let him go before
the horse drizzled him good.

Here you go.

01:41.409 --> 01:42.409
_

02:44.887 --> 02:48.006
- Doors.
- Got it.

02:59.485 --> 03:01.653
Mrs. Zygmunt.

03:01.654 --> 03:04.322
I am Mr. Barrow,

03:04.323 --> 03:07.442
director of the Knickerbocker Hospital.

03:07.443 --> 03:11.246
My deepest condolences.

03:11.247 --> 03:13.898
He fought the good fight.

03:15.868 --> 03:18.403
He was cremated?

03:19.755 --> 03:23.124
But he purchased a cemetery plot

03:23.125 --> 03:25.794
only a few month ago.

03:27.547 --> 03:30.382
It was his final wishes,

03:30.383 --> 03:32.467
which he stated to me

03:32.468 --> 03:36.504
just moments before his passing.

03:37.523 --> 03:41.309
And out of respect

03:41.310 --> 03:43.278
for your grief,

03:43.279 --> 03:47.400
I've cut the cremation fee in half.

03:47.401 --> 03:51.953
So we'll only be needing $5

03:51.954 --> 03:54.355
before we release him to you.

04:12.808 --> 04:16.761
You can waste your time
scrubbing in if it suits you,

04:16.762 --> 04:20.398
but I told you your
role is to talk Gallinger

04:20.399 --> 04:23.134
through the procedure, nothing more.

04:44.090 --> 04:45.790
There will be no risk of ischemia,

04:45.791 --> 04:48.376
as you will not need to
clamp the descending aorta.

04:48.377 --> 04:51.129
Nurse Pell, pulse, please.

04:51.130 --> 04:53.966
- It's weak at 110.
- Mm-hmm, that's the blockage.

04:53.967 --> 04:56.434
Dr. Gallinger, locate a site

04:56.435 --> 04:58.970
above the weakened arterial
wall of the aneurism

04:58.971 --> 05:02.023
that will be able to
endure a small puncture

05:02.024 --> 05:04.843
and subsequent manipulation.

05:08.481 --> 05:10.699
Should be good there.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.200
Once you make your incision,

05:12.201 --> 05:15.370
blood will begin escaping the aorta.

05:15.371 --> 05:18.239
Death by exsanguination is a risk,

05:18.240 --> 05:20.659
but once inserted correctly,
the clotting properties

05:20.660 --> 05:24.129
of the galvanic wire will
likely halt the danger.

05:24.130 --> 05:25.997
All right, ready?

05:25.998 --> 05:28.333
It's your mount.

05:30.386 --> 05:32.704
What's next?

05:34.006 --> 05:36.507
Edwards, what's next?

05:40.680 --> 05:44.015
Edwards, the man is bleeding out.

05:44.016 --> 05:45.934
Suction, Bertie.

05:50.239 --> 05:54.225
Do you really have the
courage to see this through?

05:56.862 --> 05:59.581
And only taking the scalpel will do?

05:59.582 --> 06:01.416
The pedal is more faint.

06:01.417 --> 06:03.535
Carotid is eccentric now.

06:03.536 --> 06:07.338
He'll break. He won't
want a death on his head.

06:07.339 --> 06:09.991
Perhaps you'll break first, Everett.

06:12.762 --> 06:16.047
We don't have time for your nigger games.

06:16.048 --> 06:17.599
More suction, Bertie.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.517
I've lost the pedal pulse.

06:19.518 --> 06:21.636
Water rises, air becomes scarce.

06:21.637 --> 06:23.722
Which man can survive the longest?

06:23.723 --> 06:27.558
- Care to wager, Bertie?
- No, thank you.

06:35.985 --> 06:38.937
Very well. Take the knife.

06:40.039 --> 06:41.574
Now we have a show.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.625
We won't be needing this.

06:43.626 --> 06:46.244
We tried copper in Paris and it failed.

06:46.245 --> 06:48.296
An alloy with silver is preferable

06:48.297 --> 06:50.381
for proper conductivity and corrosion.

06:50.382 --> 06:52.083
You were gonna let us use the wrong wire?

06:52.084 --> 06:55.170
I never would have let you
get that far without me.

06:55.171 --> 06:57.757
You roughen it to
increase the conductivity?

06:57.758 --> 07:00.291
Seems to double the effectiveness.

07:01.811 --> 07:04.095
I'll now feed the wire through

07:04.096 --> 07:06.432
so that it coils in the aorta,

07:06.433 --> 07:10.351
making good contact with the aneurism.

07:10.352 --> 07:11.903
Pulse is weak.

07:11.904 --> 07:15.440
If he dies because of your horseshit,

07:15.441 --> 07:17.492
I am going to stab you in the throat

07:17.493 --> 07:19.327
with my father's Union Army sword.

07:19.328 --> 07:21.279
Union? I would have thought Confederate.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.997
Need the electrical terminals.

07:22.998 --> 07:24.649
Oh, allow me.

07:26.168 --> 07:29.003
The way things have been working so
well around here electricity-wise,

07:29.004 --> 07:31.039
be my guest.

07:36.962 --> 07:38.930
10 milliamperes, please.

07:43.803 --> 07:46.838
- Now.
- Careful you don't cook the man.

07:54.146 --> 07:56.314
The pedal pulse is back.

07:56.315 --> 07:58.484
Carotid is regular.

07:58.485 --> 08:00.535
The aneurism is beginning to clot

08:00.536 --> 08:03.071
and harden.

08:03.072 --> 08:06.691
Looks like it's Mr. Gatchell's lucky day.

08:07.793 --> 08:10.411
How long does he remain this way?

08:10.412 --> 08:13.047
For an hour to ensure
the clotting is complete

08:13.048 --> 08:16.001
and the weak tissue has fully firmed up.

08:16.002 --> 08:19.304
Then clip the wire, stitch the incision,

08:19.305 --> 08:21.289
and close.

08:22.591 --> 08:26.345
So I suppose we won't be needing
your expertise any longer.

08:26.346 --> 08:27.847
I suppose not.

08:27.848 --> 08:30.349
Gallinger!

08:30.350 --> 08:32.518
Idiot.

08:32.519 --> 08:35.403
A surgeon needs his hands.

08:35.404 --> 08:37.388
Help him up.

08:41.110 --> 08:43.727
Everett, scrub out.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.785
Next time, kick the man instead.

09:02.264 --> 09:05.384
- Right on time, Mr. Speight.
- Always.

09:05.385 --> 09:07.720
Even got myself a new tie for the occasion.

09:07.721 --> 09:10.855
It's very nice. Shall we call on her?

09:10.856 --> 09:12.807
This place is no big deal.

09:12.808 --> 09:15.977
I've seen nicer. After you, miss.

09:22.701 --> 09:24.236
Miss Cornelia Robertson

09:24.237 --> 09:26.738
and Mr. Jacob Speight of the
New York City Health Department.

09:26.739 --> 09:28.907
You're a mister, mister.

09:28.908 --> 09:31.242
I'm Inspector Speight.

09:32.745 --> 09:34.662
Cornelia, dear.

09:34.663 --> 09:37.248
I'm so sorry about Daniel.

09:37.249 --> 09:39.550
He was a good man.

09:39.551 --> 09:40.920
The finest.

09:40.921 --> 09:43.088
But I hear Cora is doing a bit better.

09:43.089 --> 09:44.722
Yes, I was there this morning.

09:44.723 --> 09:47.258
The doctors are feeling
optimistic after the surgery.

09:47.259 --> 09:48.760
Well, that is good news.

09:48.761 --> 09:51.346
Yes. Inspector.

09:51.347 --> 09:53.681
If you don't mind, I'll not shake your hand

09:53.682 --> 09:56.651
owing to the disease and not
knowing your hygiene habits.

09:56.652 --> 09:58.903
You owe Mrs. Hemming an apology.

09:58.904 --> 10:01.522
Miss Robertson, every
human being has bowels

10:01.523 --> 10:04.325
and every one of them
evacuates those bowels.

10:04.326 --> 10:07.279
It's how God made all of us no matter who.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.282
What He didn't guarantee is that everyone
would wash their hands after doing so.

10:11.283 --> 10:13.668
It's how the fever found
its way into this house

10:13.669 --> 10:15.287
just like any other.

10:15.288 --> 10:17.622
No offense meant.

10:17.623 --> 10:20.591
- Would you care to sit down?
- Oh, thank you.

10:43.065 --> 10:44.949
You need something?

10:44.950 --> 10:47.452
I was speaking with Mrs. Alford.

10:47.453 --> 10:50.656
She was concerned that you
hadn't been by to check on her.

10:50.657 --> 10:52.573
I have sent Dr. Chickering.

10:52.574 --> 10:54.358
He's kept me informed.

10:55.711 --> 10:58.497
She believes you're avoiding her.

10:58.498 --> 11:02.200
I'm doing no such thing.
It's simple protocol.

11:03.719 --> 11:07.138
She said that? That I'm avoiding her?

11:07.139 --> 11:10.208
In so many words.

11:15.981 --> 11:17.932
You seem to be enjoying the coffee.

11:17.933 --> 11:20.518
- It's mighty good.
- It's prepared Turkish style.

11:20.519 --> 11:22.653
- The best.
- It certainly is.

11:22.654 --> 11:24.489
No fear of disease there?

11:24.490 --> 11:27.391
The boiling keeps it safe.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.081
Well, shall we get on with it?

11:33.082 --> 11:35.833
I'm happy to help in whatever way I can.

11:37.786 --> 11:41.540
Your husband and daughter took ill
at the same time or staggered-like?

11:41.541 --> 11:43.624
First Daniel in the evening,

11:43.625 --> 11:46.511
then by the next morning, Cora as well.

11:46.512 --> 11:49.715
Had your husband been away
recently? Perhaps travelling?

11:49.716 --> 11:52.216
Not recently.

11:52.217 --> 11:53.851
What about at his place of work?

11:53.852 --> 11:56.521
He doesn't work.

11:56.522 --> 11:58.724
Didn't, I should say.

11:58.725 --> 12:01.442
What about lady friends?

12:01.443 --> 12:03.644
I have many.

12:03.645 --> 12:05.480
I meant your husband.

12:05.481 --> 12:08.066
Were you aware of anything
he had going on on the side?

12:08.067 --> 12:10.318
- Inspector!
- You want the truffles,

12:10.319 --> 12:12.570
you need the pig to get
his nose a little dirty.

12:12.571 --> 12:16.157
Perhaps the pig can at least
try to be less of a swine.

12:16.158 --> 12:19.043
I'll do my best.

12:19.044 --> 12:21.329
So, Mrs. Hemming,

12:21.330 --> 12:23.948
would you say your husband was...

12:26.668 --> 12:28.553
an upstanding gentleman?

12:28.554 --> 12:30.254
He was.

12:30.255 --> 12:33.524
Hmm, I'm sure. And how many on staff?

12:33.525 --> 12:35.260
Approximately 15.

12:35.261 --> 12:38.012
A few come and go. We
add on extras part-time.

12:38.013 --> 12:40.265
Cooks, maids, as we need them.

12:40.266 --> 12:42.100
Some come to our summer house with us,

12:42.101 --> 12:45.104
others stay behind and keep
this house ready for our return.

12:45.105 --> 12:47.271
Peach melba?

12:47.272 --> 12:48.906
You make your own ice cream?

12:48.907 --> 12:51.409
I've never seen it outside
a confectionary store.

12:51.410 --> 12:53.277
Would you care for some, Inspector?

12:53.278 --> 12:55.196
It was Daniel and Cora's favorite.

12:55.197 --> 12:57.031
But it's not cooked.

12:57.032 --> 13:00.067
Are you sure you're willing to risk it?

13:03.455 --> 13:04.957
You're right, Miss Robertson.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.925
I really did forget myself that time.

13:07.926 --> 13:09.994
Back to the issue.

13:10.796 --> 13:12.763
So, Mrs. Hemming,

13:12.764 --> 13:15.499
I'll need to ask you
about your toilet rituals.

13:35.821 --> 13:38.323
"By the shores of Gitche Gumee,

13:38.324 --> 13:40.791
by the shining Big-Sea-Water..."

13:42.294 --> 13:45.213
"...stood the wigwam of Nokomis,

13:45.214 --> 13:48.382
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis."

13:48.383 --> 13:50.751
I love the hand gestures.

13:50.752 --> 13:53.671
This is how I was taught it
in third grade elocution class.

13:53.672 --> 13:55.423
I'm sure you were the most adorable one.

13:55.424 --> 13:58.142
- I was.
- Come on, come on.

13:58.143 --> 14:00.179
"Dark behind it rose the forest.

14:00.180 --> 14:04.482
Rose the dark and gloomy pine trees.

14:04.483 --> 14:07.985
Rose the fir with leaves upon them"...

14:07.986 --> 14:11.190
Cones upon them.

14:11.191 --> 14:12.857
He was so close.

14:12.858 --> 14:14.575
That's two bottles you owe me,

14:14.576 --> 14:16.494
Thackery the Wise. No, three.

14:16.495 --> 14:18.946
- Three? How?
- For the appendix.

14:18.947 --> 14:20.448
Which part?

14:20.449 --> 14:22.366
The removal part or the location part.

14:22.367 --> 14:23.829
The removal part.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.503
Oh, the part that no one has survived yet.

14:25.504 --> 14:28.707
When I prove that the
appendix can be removed

14:28.708 --> 14:31.877
and the patient can live,
we shall make history

14:31.878 --> 14:35.963
and I shall get my third bottle.

14:37.716 --> 14:41.302
But how can you remove
it if you can't find it?

14:44.439 --> 14:46.391
Hey, you know what?

14:46.392 --> 14:48.025
I think we should get out of here.

14:48.026 --> 14:50.394
- You're turning in?
- No, no, no.

14:50.395 --> 14:52.980
There's a 100 parties in the city tonight.

14:52.981 --> 14:54.733
Let's go out and have some more drinks.

14:54.734 --> 14:58.403
John, maybe we should just,
you know, say good night.

14:58.404 --> 15:00.738
Nonsense. Jules, you up
for more Christmas cheer?

15:00.739 --> 15:04.375
You buy the booze, I'll
cheer all night long.

15:04.376 --> 15:06.377
John. John, don't.

15:06.378 --> 15:08.663
What is it? What's the matter?

15:08.664 --> 15:10.548
It's been such a pleasant evening.

15:10.549 --> 15:12.583
- Let's just stay here.
- Abby, come on.

15:12.584 --> 15:15.254
We're just gonna have a bit more fun.

15:15.255 --> 15:17.555
You always want more.

15:17.556 --> 15:21.008
I always want more of you.

15:25.147 --> 15:27.565
♪ Isn't it a knobby one?
It's just the proper style. ♪

15:27.566 --> 15:31.218
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
- ♪ King Wenceslas looked out... ♪

15:37.109 --> 15:39.610
Ho, ho, ho!

15:55.377 --> 15:57.995
I just came by to check on you.

15:59.047 --> 16:02.049
Is it because you saw me raising my hand?

16:04.386 --> 16:06.805
Oh, what is the steam for?

16:06.806 --> 16:08.807
It's infused with mercury.

16:08.808 --> 16:11.592
It's to help with those
headaches you've been getting.

16:13.111 --> 16:14.678
Thank you, Nurse.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.157
It looks good.

16:29.328 --> 16:31.162
The flap is vibrant.

16:31.163 --> 16:34.165
I can see some healing already.

16:34.166 --> 16:37.368
Looks like it'll be a healthy attachment.

16:39.671 --> 16:42.957
Don't be so serious, John.

16:44.509 --> 16:46.510
It doesn't suit you.

16:46.511 --> 16:49.964
And it makes me as
uncomfortable as it makes you.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.051
Sit, please.

16:57.239 --> 17:01.525
This good attitude will be very
helpful over the next few weeks.

17:01.526 --> 17:04.528
And the next few decades.

17:06.915 --> 17:10.951
Usually I'm the one
putting my patients at ease.

17:11.837 --> 17:14.422
But I'm not just any patient.

17:14.423 --> 17:16.656
No, you're not.

17:18.877 --> 17:21.595
I know this isn't easy for you.

17:21.596 --> 17:25.883
I told you, I'm very
used to this condition.

17:27.435 --> 17:29.753
Of course.

17:36.561 --> 17:38.612
You could have gone to any one

17:38.613 --> 17:41.599
of a dozen surgeons in this city.

17:43.568 --> 17:46.654
But I chose to see you.

17:46.655 --> 17:48.573
And that wasn't fair.

17:48.574 --> 17:51.410
Oh, we're well beyond what's fair.

17:51.411 --> 17:54.945
There's nothing about what's
happened to you that's fair.

17:59.217 --> 18:01.952
I suppose I came because I...

18:04.089 --> 18:07.091
I wanted to remember
what it was like before.

18:08.093 --> 18:10.795
Everything...

18:10.796 --> 18:13.297
stretched out in front of us.

18:17.269 --> 18:20.821
I should have chosen you,

18:20.822 --> 18:23.741
despite the madness that would have come.

18:23.742 --> 18:26.393
I wish that were true, but it's not.

18:27.446 --> 18:30.581
You made the right choice in leaving me.

18:30.582 --> 18:33.567
You just did it with the wrong man.

18:34.669 --> 18:37.454
We were something, weren't we?

18:38.290 --> 18:40.292
Alive

18:40.293 --> 18:42.793
and beautiful.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.548
We were spectacular.

19:07.786 --> 19:09.570
See?

19:09.571 --> 19:11.823
Back in no time.

19:11.824 --> 19:15.494
No emergencies.

19:15.495 --> 19:17.878
And I was able to get my wife's dresser

19:17.879 --> 19:20.631
to her mother's without incident.

19:20.632 --> 19:22.416
Your wife's dresser?

19:24.586 --> 19:26.504
My wife's dresser.

19:26.505 --> 19:28.088
Well, I'll just leave 'em hitched up

19:28.089 --> 19:30.891
in case the missus has any
more furniture she needs moved.

19:30.892 --> 19:33.377
Now, that would be advisable.

19:42.938 --> 19:45.773
Mr. Cleary.

19:45.774 --> 19:47.441
I need a moment.

19:47.442 --> 19:49.193
That's all it usually takes me.

19:55.534 --> 19:58.085
I want to know what you've
been on about these past days.

19:58.086 --> 20:00.955
The smirks, the comments, lurking around.

20:00.956 --> 20:03.791
You never paid me any heed before, Sister.

20:03.792 --> 20:08.213
Besides, perhaps I'm just taking the piss.

20:08.214 --> 20:09.881
It stops now, Cleary,

20:09.882 --> 20:12.299
or I won't hesitate to
take it up with Mr. Barrow

20:12.300 --> 20:14.386
and your employment will be terminated.

20:16.521 --> 20:18.522
That's a funny word to use.

20:18.523 --> 20:20.474
Terminated.

20:20.475 --> 20:23.477
You'll stop your shenanigans,
is that understood?

20:27.566 --> 20:29.650
I'll do as I please.

20:29.651 --> 20:32.536
It's you who'll do all the understanding.

20:32.537 --> 20:34.405
See, I know about you...

20:34.406 --> 20:36.957
the mothers, the babies,

20:36.958 --> 20:38.743
the abortions.

20:38.744 --> 20:41.745
Maggie Dell, Jana Krupp,

20:41.746 --> 20:45.083
the Kupferschmidt girl
above the cobbler on Ludlow.

20:45.084 --> 20:47.284
I've seen you with all of them.

20:52.057 --> 20:53.641
Cleary... Thomas...

20:53.642 --> 20:56.810
Don't. You are what you are.

20:56.811 --> 20:59.813
You defy God and you kill His creations.

20:59.814 --> 21:01.265
And you stand there

21:01.266 --> 21:03.517
looking down on dirty old Cleary.

21:03.518 --> 21:06.737
Well, old Cleary's got it in store for you.

21:06.738 --> 21:10.407
You see, a girl could
hang for killing babies.

21:10.408 --> 21:12.110
And if the bishop knew what you were doing,

21:12.111 --> 21:14.194
you'd be up to your arse in it there, too.

21:14.195 --> 21:16.864
You'd do that to me? Are you that cruel?

21:16.865 --> 21:18.832
If need be.

21:18.833 --> 21:24.171
You see, there is money
to be made here, Sister,

21:24.172 --> 21:26.674
and I don't intend to
leave it for anyone else.

21:26.675 --> 21:30.127
From now on, you'll split your earnings.

21:30.128 --> 21:33.798
60-40 tilted my way.

21:33.799 --> 21:36.000
I can't. I won't.

21:36.001 --> 21:37.901
You can

21:37.902 --> 21:40.254
'cause you already did.

21:47.145 --> 21:48.729
Anything to conclude?

21:48.730 --> 21:51.065
Hardly. I need to come
back, interview the help,

21:51.066 --> 21:54.234
talk to some of the sick
families and their staff.

21:54.235 --> 21:57.154
We need to get a full picture of this
if we're gonna get to the bottom of it.

21:57.155 --> 22:00.490
Fine, I'll arrange it with
Mrs. Hemming and the others.

22:01.826 --> 22:03.961
Think I can get a lift downtown?

22:03.962 --> 22:05.996
No. Good day.

22:05.997 --> 22:07.414
That's okay.

22:07.415 --> 22:10.367
I need to root around their garbage anyway.

22:19.260 --> 22:21.680
Evening, son.

22:21.681 --> 22:23.847
Evening.

22:23.848 --> 22:25.766
You here to get Cornelia?

22:25.767 --> 22:27.351
No.

22:27.352 --> 22:30.738
I came to fetch you for a dinner
the Robertsons are having tonight

22:30.739 --> 22:33.358
for Cornelia and Phillip, her fiancé.

22:33.359 --> 22:36.059
The captain asked for you personal.

22:37.028 --> 22:39.947
I just had to see it with my own eyes.

22:39.948 --> 22:43.200
My boy, a doctor at the Knick.

22:43.201 --> 22:45.569
Ain't that something?

22:46.755 --> 22:49.590
You should have come in
and seen it from the inside.

22:49.591 --> 22:52.459
I'm okay out here.

22:52.460 --> 22:55.380
So, boy, you save anyone's life today?

22:56.882 --> 22:58.766
Actually, I did.

22:58.767 --> 23:00.968
Not that any of them
were very happy about it.

23:00.969 --> 23:04.471
If all you got is that
shiner, then it's a good trade.

23:05.306 --> 23:08.226
Any others or you the only one?

23:08.227 --> 23:12.229
Only one in a white hospital
in the whole city, I think.

23:12.230 --> 23:15.265
Can't be others till there's one.

23:16.201 --> 23:18.902
Used to be a great old building.

23:18.903 --> 23:20.738
Neighborhood, too.

23:20.739 --> 23:22.656
Captain Robertson lived down here.

23:22.657 --> 23:24.708
And Vanderbilt.

23:24.709 --> 23:26.410
Now they've gone uptown

23:26.411 --> 23:29.913
and it's all them from
who knows where down here.

23:29.914 --> 23:32.250
People just leaving it to 'em.

23:32.251 --> 23:35.702
Taking our work and
making a mess of the place.

23:43.428 --> 23:45.679
Good evening, ladies.

23:47.148 --> 23:48.649
Is that him?

23:48.650 --> 23:51.985
Mm-hmm. That's him.

23:51.986 --> 23:53.938
Is he really that good?

23:53.939 --> 23:55.940
He really is.

23:55.941 --> 23:59.977
- But I think I might be better.
- Dr. Thackery.

24:02.413 --> 24:04.698
Dr. Thackery.

24:04.699 --> 24:07.534
Thank you for coming to see Mrs. Alford.

24:07.535 --> 24:10.037
You think I did it for you?

24:10.038 --> 24:11.623
No.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.123
Of course not.

24:13.124 --> 24:14.792
I just know it meant a lot to her.

24:14.793 --> 24:17.828
She was my patient and I was
checking on her, that's all.

24:20.265 --> 24:22.416
Good evening, Nurse Elkins.

24:23.434 --> 24:26.136
Chinatown. Mott and Canal.

24:36.397 --> 24:39.317
Then Everett just socked him in the eye.

24:39.318 --> 24:41.118
What did the Negro doctor do?

24:41.119 --> 24:45.489
Nothing. He just got up and kept operating.

24:45.490 --> 24:47.991
Dr. Thackery didn't get mad?

24:47.992 --> 24:49.494
No.

24:49.495 --> 24:51.695
No, I actually think Thackery enjoyed it.

24:54.132 --> 24:56.167
Did any rub off?

24:56.168 --> 24:57.669
Any what?

24:57.670 --> 25:00.087
- Any of his color.
- Clara.

25:00.088 --> 25:04.591
Edith Dutson said it can happen.

25:04.592 --> 25:06.810
Right, well, Edith Dutson
and her whole family

25:06.811 --> 25:09.880
also believe that Jesus
Christ came to America.

25:09.881 --> 25:11.631
Ahem.

25:12.483 --> 25:14.067
Good evening, Father.

25:14.068 --> 25:17.104
Why don't you and your
sister wash up for dinner?

25:17.105 --> 25:20.941
Well, it's your turn after dinner.

25:22.026 --> 25:24.644
It's okay. I think you're cheating anyway.

25:28.032 --> 25:30.751
So how was work today?

25:30.752 --> 25:33.820
Was that asylum true to form?

25:34.873 --> 25:38.542
No, nothing eventful
happened that I can recall.

25:48.970 --> 25:51.021
Jesse, how many times I tell you,

25:51.022 --> 25:53.223
do not come into my
kitchen with them boots on?

25:53.224 --> 25:56.560
I do not need manure all over the floor.

25:57.395 --> 25:59.397
Does that go for me as well?

25:59.398 --> 26:02.149
Algie!

26:03.985 --> 26:05.570
My boy.

26:05.571 --> 26:07.238
Oh, what...

26:07.239 --> 26:09.073
what is this on your face?

26:09.074 --> 26:10.657
The boy saved a life today.

26:10.658 --> 26:12.243
Well, since when is that news?

26:12.244 --> 26:14.995
Though he could get on a
telephone and let us know

26:14.996 --> 26:18.966
what he's up to now and then instead
of just coming by once in a while.

26:18.967 --> 26:21.252
The captain has two of
them in the house now.

26:21.253 --> 26:23.253
One upstairs and one downstairs,

26:23.254 --> 26:25.339
so somebody can always hear it ringing.

26:25.340 --> 26:27.674
I've been busy.

26:27.675 --> 26:31.345
So busy that you can only come
when you get a formal invitation,

26:31.346 --> 26:33.597
but not to see his lonely mama.

26:33.598 --> 26:36.316
- Lonely?
- Jesse, please.

26:36.317 --> 26:38.735
Them horses the one get all your attention.

26:38.736 --> 26:40.604
Their feet need tending to.

26:40.605 --> 26:42.806
And mine don't?

27:18.026 --> 27:20.343
Algie!

27:23.898 --> 27:25.782
I am so happy you could make it.

27:25.783 --> 27:26.985
I appreciate the invitation.

27:26.986 --> 27:29.403
We're throwing this little
welcome-back for Phillip

27:29.404 --> 27:31.488
and I wanted you to meet him.

27:31.489 --> 27:34.658
You're the last of us to
give him final approval.

27:34.659 --> 27:37.411
I don't think you've met Hobart Showalter,

27:37.412 --> 27:39.463
Cornelia's future father-in-law.

27:39.464 --> 27:41.465
A pleasure, Mr. Showalter.

27:41.466 --> 27:43.668
The captain speaks very highly of you.

27:43.669 --> 27:45.218
Says you're a gifted surgeon.

27:45.219 --> 27:46.586
That is very generous.

27:46.587 --> 27:49.674
There's no need for modesty, Algernon.

27:49.675 --> 27:52.476
You will never meet a
Negro with as much ability

27:52.477 --> 27:54.478
and ingenuity as this one.

27:54.479 --> 27:57.647
And you let me know if I need
to help you with Thackery.

27:57.648 --> 27:59.066
Hobart's in rubber.

27:59.067 --> 28:01.401
Has plantations down in Ecuador.

28:01.402 --> 28:03.353
- Booming business?
- Beyond belief.

28:03.354 --> 28:05.655
He's agreed to finance my expansion.

28:05.656 --> 28:09.276
I have no doubt the rewards
will be worth any risk.

28:10.445 --> 28:12.363
Ecuador.

28:12.364 --> 28:14.781
I hear the jungles down there
can be quite treacherous.

28:14.782 --> 28:16.283
Don't believe it.

28:16.284 --> 28:18.035
The natives are like children...

28:18.036 --> 28:21.922
docile, obedient, and they
work for wages so small

28:21.923 --> 28:24.174
that even August here
couldn't quarrel with it.

28:26.378 --> 28:29.213
Yeah, free labor can
certainly change the equation.

28:29.214 --> 28:30.931
History has shown us that.

28:30.932 --> 28:34.017
- It built the pyramids.
- Among other things.

28:34.018 --> 28:36.721
Now, Hobart was saying
that he has seen an increase

28:36.722 --> 28:38.972
in demand for rubber in the medical field.

28:38.973 --> 28:40.974
Some interesting new companies.

28:40.975 --> 28:44.228
A lot of opportunities for a clever man

28:44.229 --> 28:45.695
with greater ambitions.

28:45.696 --> 28:47.614
It's something you
should want to look into.

28:47.615 --> 28:50.267
I should indeed.

29:37.198 --> 29:40.033
You want to join us?

29:40.034 --> 29:42.702
I'll set you up with a yen tsiang.

29:42.703 --> 29:45.989
Jade bowl. Beautiful pipe.

29:54.966 --> 29:56.766
And since our meeting at the Hemmings',

29:56.767 --> 29:59.553
the health inspector's uncovered
three more cases with typhoid.

29:59.554 --> 30:00.887
- All uptown?
- Yes.

30:00.888 --> 30:02.439
There's another group of cases

30:02.440 --> 30:03.723
down in the Orchard Street tenements,

30:03.724 --> 30:05.642
but Mr. Speight's not
sure if they're related.

30:05.643 --> 30:08.895
I hope you won't be conducting
any interviews with those people.

30:08.896 --> 30:12.649
Those people are 90% of the
patients in the Knick, Mother.

30:12.650 --> 30:14.484
Cornelia.

30:14.485 --> 30:17.154
Last fall Gloria Ellis and several others

30:17.155 --> 30:19.573
took a walking tour of
the poor neighborhoods.

30:19.574 --> 30:21.993
The Jewish quarter. The Tenderloin.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.911
They had to toss their shoes before
getting back in their carriages

30:24.912 --> 30:28.832
because they were covered in
the most disgusting sludge.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.334
And in my neighborhood,

30:30.335 --> 30:32.919
we call that sludge the
poor man's shoe polish.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.839
Evening, Mrs. Robertson.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.140
Cornelia.

30:37.141 --> 30:38.758
Phillip, I'd like you to meet...

30:38.759 --> 30:41.978
- Dr. Edwards.
- What gave me away?

30:41.979 --> 30:44.097
Are you here to see your mother?

30:44.098 --> 30:45.732
She's in the back.

30:45.733 --> 30:48.735
Actually, Captain Robertson sent me
a personal invitation for the evening.

30:48.736 --> 30:52.189
Oh, of course he did, and we
are delighted that you accepted.

30:52.190 --> 30:55.525
Would you excuse me for a moment?

30:58.529 --> 31:01.364
Phillip just arrived back
from San Francisco yesterday.

31:01.365 --> 31:04.117
Yes, your father was telling me.

31:04.118 --> 31:07.003
So, are you back for good, then?

31:07.004 --> 31:08.338
For now.

31:08.339 --> 31:10.290
Sometime after the wedding,

31:10.291 --> 31:13.460
Cornelia and I will
head out that way again.

31:13.461 --> 31:15.128
Neely...

31:15.129 --> 31:17.548
you haven't mentioned a move west.

31:17.549 --> 31:20.517
That's because this is news to me.

31:20.518 --> 31:23.470
Your father wants someone
there on a more permanent basis.

31:23.471 --> 31:27.090
I know the territory better than anyone.

31:30.228 --> 31:31.778
Getting Cornelia out of New York,

31:31.779 --> 31:33.480
you will need all the help you can get.

31:33.481 --> 31:36.199
Well, San Francisco is a great city.

31:36.200 --> 31:39.903
In many ways, more
progressive than New York.

31:39.904 --> 31:42.605
I shouldn't say that too loudly in here.

31:57.588 --> 31:59.924
Captain, if you will,

31:59.925 --> 32:02.475
when I point to you,
please speak into the horn.

32:02.476 --> 32:04.394
With pleasure, Mr. Edison.

32:10.901 --> 32:14.521
This is Captain August Robertson.

32:14.522 --> 32:17.441
I am happy

32:17.442 --> 32:20.111
to demonstrate this machine.

32:20.112 --> 32:22.245
How fortunate we are

32:22.246 --> 32:25.031
to be living in these times.

32:26.083 --> 32:28.651
Very good.

32:35.710 --> 32:37.962
You all right?

32:37.963 --> 32:41.247
Just a little surprised
by Phillip's announcement.

32:42.767 --> 32:45.218
San Francisco?

32:45.219 --> 32:47.837
Might as well be Neptune.

32:48.889 --> 32:50.640
We can always send you
some of your father's

32:50.641 --> 32:53.343
wax recordings if you get lonely for home.

32:56.647 --> 32:59.733
This is Captain August Robertson.

32:59.734 --> 33:01.785
Oh!

33:03.989 --> 33:07.407
Bravo! Bravo!

33:08.827 --> 33:10.661
...to be living in these times.

33:10.662 --> 33:13.129
Oh, listen to that.

33:13.130 --> 33:14.914
Oh, that's marvelous.

33:14.915 --> 33:18.251
- Well done, Mr. Edison. Well done.
- Thank you. Thank you all.

33:18.252 --> 33:20.870
Ha! Marvelous.

33:21.722 --> 33:24.675
- Let's do another.
- Okay.

33:24.676 --> 33:27.310
Hobarth Showalter tells me your company

33:27.311 --> 33:29.095
has made great strides with suction.

33:29.096 --> 33:30.681
Vacuuming.

33:30.682 --> 33:33.299
An electric method to suction.

33:50.501 --> 33:52.203
How is it with liquids?

33:52.204 --> 33:54.921
- What kind?
- Blood, specifically.

33:54.922 --> 33:57.340
- Blood?
- For surgical purposes.

33:57.341 --> 34:00.293
Can it vacuum blood
without being too forceful?

34:00.294 --> 34:02.262
We could adjust the power

34:02.263 --> 34:06.049
and make a bag with a rubber
bladder to hold the contents.

34:06.050 --> 34:09.185
You'd need to clean the works with
regularity, but it can be easily done.

34:09.186 --> 34:11.254
May I?

34:23.400 --> 34:25.435
How much do you want for it?

34:26.487 --> 34:29.038
Atmen.

34:29.039 --> 34:32.125
I'm starting to pick some of it up.

34:32.126 --> 34:33.827
You always said Latin and Greek

34:33.828 --> 34:36.746
were the most important languages
for a physician to learn.

34:37.965 --> 34:40.800
Turns out it's actually
something called Yiddish.

34:40.801 --> 34:43.168
Atmen.

34:45.922 --> 34:48.206
Her lungs are full.

34:52.263 --> 34:54.264
Fever.

34:54.266 --> 34:55.899
Likely pneumonia.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.351
Doesn't look like tuberculosis.

35:01.071 --> 35:03.907
When it gets this busy,
we have to prioritize.

35:03.908 --> 35:06.409
Two means she's a secondary emergency.

35:07.862 --> 35:09.979
Danke schoen.

35:12.666 --> 35:14.367
Hmm.

35:14.368 --> 35:16.786
What does he look like to you?

35:23.627 --> 35:25.595
Dead.

35:25.596 --> 35:28.515
We're needing some help!

35:28.516 --> 35:31.134
Help!

35:34.355 --> 35:36.940
He don't need a shoeshine.
He needs a doctor.

35:36.941 --> 35:40.144
- My neck's all froze.
- How long have you been this way?

35:40.145 --> 35:41.479
He's seizing.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.846
Get him down, Bertie. Get him down.

35:45.530 --> 35:47.650
- Try to turn his neck.
- Fingers away from his mouth.

35:47.651 --> 35:49.736
Don't come in contact with
any liquids if you can help it.

35:49.737 --> 35:52.156
- He knows.
- Fever, convulsions,

35:52.157 --> 35:55.041
disorientation, his body
is bowed and the neck.

35:55.042 --> 35:57.544
It's two of the Kernig's
signs. It's meningitis.

35:57.545 --> 35:59.462
Dead on.

35:59.463 --> 36:01.998
- What are these?
- Rat bites.

36:01.999 --> 36:04.133
He was baiting rats in the ring.

36:04.134 --> 36:06.836
Stomped on a big one and
lost his footing in the mush.

36:06.837 --> 36:09.338
They started biting the shite out of him.

36:11.141 --> 36:15.044
I'm gonna guess there's
no chalk marking for that.

36:23.020 --> 36:24.521
Let's sit you up.

36:26.357 --> 36:28.358
Oh, shit. What is that?

36:28.359 --> 36:31.277
Cantharidin. Spanish fly.

36:31.278 --> 36:34.981
Form a blister, a counterirritant
to help you with effusion.

36:37.418 --> 36:39.919
If his fever goes up, put the
ice bladders on him all night.

36:39.920 --> 36:43.540
Continue with a tincture of three
drops of veratrum viride every hour

36:43.541 --> 36:45.208
until his skin becomes moist

36:45.209 --> 36:47.211
or he complains of nausea.

36:47.212 --> 36:50.797
I'm going home, but I'll be back first
thing to check on him this morning.

36:55.970 --> 36:58.304
What do you think you're doing?

36:59.223 --> 37:01.058
I'm reading his chart.

37:01.059 --> 37:03.059
Surely there's no harm in that.

37:03.060 --> 37:05.678
There's harm in everything you do.

37:09.400 --> 37:12.185
You want to take another swing at me?

37:13.287 --> 37:15.605
I'm ready this time.

37:16.907 --> 37:18.825
Hmm?

37:42.600 --> 37:44.851
Any chance of finding a home for her?

37:44.852 --> 37:46.937
For babies it's easier,

37:46.938 --> 37:49.489
but girls are less in demand.

37:49.490 --> 37:51.609
I'll file the birth certificate.

37:51.610 --> 37:53.943
And she'll need a name.

37:53.944 --> 37:55.828
Perhaps Matilda.

37:55.829 --> 37:57.497
Tilly for short.

37:57.498 --> 37:59.832
I see her more as an Elisha

37:59.833 --> 38:01.501
from the Book of Luke.

38:01.502 --> 38:04.121
The Bible really took my Tilly suggestion

38:04.122 --> 38:06.756
right out at the knees.

38:06.757 --> 38:09.042
We'll need to purchase more bassinets

38:09.043 --> 38:11.010
and perhaps another pram or two.

38:11.011 --> 38:12.595
Church fund?

38:12.596 --> 38:14.714
The Knick's social welfare office account.

38:14.715 --> 38:16.466
You did have the privilege of naming her.

38:16.467 --> 38:18.518
Very well. My office will pay.

38:18.519 --> 38:21.170
But her middle name is now Grace.

38:22.439 --> 38:25.591
You ladies certainly do
enjoy playing with babies.

38:27.394 --> 38:29.646
Yes, that's all we do around here.

38:29.647 --> 38:32.365
Just play with babies.

38:40.991 --> 38:42.875
I'm home.

38:42.876 --> 38:45.328
Good evening, darling.

38:48.215 --> 38:50.299
How was your day?

38:50.300 --> 38:52.051
Not as bad as yesterday.

38:52.052 --> 38:54.671
Did Dr. Edwards apologize for his trickery

38:54.672 --> 38:56.839
with your patient in the operating room?

39:00.094 --> 39:01.310
Far from it.

39:01.311 --> 39:03.396
It only seems to have emboldened him.

39:03.397 --> 39:05.314
Started looking over my shoulder,

39:05.315 --> 39:07.316
checking my work like a schoolmarm.

39:07.317 --> 39:09.652
- The smug bastard.
- Everett!

39:09.653 --> 39:12.305
Lillian can't understand.
Come here, sweetie.

39:15.192 --> 39:16.993
Hello.

39:16.994 --> 39:19.445
What are you going to do about him?

39:19.446 --> 39:22.081
Hold my ground.

39:22.082 --> 39:25.952
Only be a matter of time
before Edwards gets tired

39:25.953 --> 39:28.588
of waiting in the wings and leaves

39:28.589 --> 39:30.957
and I'll get what was rightfully
mine from the beginning.

39:30.958 --> 39:34.260
Let's just hope Thackery
continues to feel the same way.

39:34.261 --> 39:36.046
Not to worry.

39:36.047 --> 39:38.097
Thack is fully on my side.

39:38.098 --> 39:40.416
He knows who's right and who's wrong here.

39:41.769 --> 39:44.420
The orderlies have a nickname for Edwards.

39:46.056 --> 39:48.357
They've taken to calling him Dr. Darkie.

39:48.358 --> 39:51.562
That's terrible.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.896
But funny.

39:53.897 --> 39:57.200
Supper will be ready shortly
if you'd like to wash up.

39:57.201 --> 39:59.568
In a minute.

40:02.239 --> 40:04.241
Hi. Hi.

40:09.913 --> 40:12.531
Ambulance!

40:19.139 --> 40:21.057
Miss?

40:21.058 --> 40:23.309
What seems to be the problem?

40:25.012 --> 40:27.596
Shall we go for a little ride?

40:29.266 --> 40:31.067
Oh, dear.

40:31.068 --> 40:33.602
What have you done?

40:34.938 --> 40:38.491
Get up there. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

40:47.618 --> 40:48.952
All right.

40:48.953 --> 40:51.288
All right, I am not a fucking doctor.

40:51.289 --> 40:54.040
I'm taking you to a doctor, all right?

40:54.041 --> 40:56.709
Pouncey, pick up the fucking pace!

41:02.800 --> 41:05.968
I want her unconscious now, Bertie.

41:05.969 --> 41:07.638
Cut through the clothes.

41:07.639 --> 41:10.439
Prep the pubis and the abdomen.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.225
And summon Sister Harriet.

41:12.226 --> 41:13.976
I'm here. What do we have?

41:13.977 --> 41:15.528
It can only be one of two things.

41:15.529 --> 41:16.980
Too much blood. That's no miscarriage.

41:16.981 --> 41:18.281
We've got to get in there now.

41:18.282 --> 41:19.982
- She under, Bertie?
- Almost.

41:19.983 --> 41:21.652
Scalpel, Lucy.

41:21.653 --> 41:24.154
You were here first. She's yours.

41:24.155 --> 41:26.772
She's out.

41:29.326 --> 41:31.527
Retractor.

41:32.830 --> 41:35.047
Oh, it's a sea of red.

41:35.048 --> 41:37.366
Suction wand.

41:38.969 --> 41:42.138
I can't find where this is coming from.

41:42.139 --> 41:46.175
Most likely the left lateral.
Search the left uterine wall.

41:46.176 --> 41:48.294
Cauterizer.

41:49.596 --> 41:51.764
There it is. Clamps. Clamps.

41:51.765 --> 41:54.317
Lots of clamps. She's split wide.

41:54.318 --> 41:56.186
How did you know?

41:56.187 --> 41:58.020
Most people are right-handed.

41:58.021 --> 42:00.357
So whatever she put up there,
the angle would likely mean

42:00.358 --> 42:02.608
she'd perforate the opposite side.

42:02.609 --> 42:04.076
She did this to herself?

42:04.077 --> 42:05.778
She didn't want to be with child.

42:05.779 --> 42:08.147
She's arresting.

42:09.750 --> 42:11.584
She won't survive.

42:11.585 --> 42:14.037
Not a chance.

42:14.038 --> 42:15.905
I have no pulse.

42:24.965 --> 42:27.433
Keep on the wound. Scalpel.

42:27.434 --> 42:29.418
What are you going to do?

42:31.972 --> 42:36.308
I'm going to try something
I've been considering.

42:57.881 --> 42:59.416
I have a pulse.

42:59.417 --> 43:01.584
That's me, Bertie.

43:01.585 --> 43:04.036
I'm pumping her heart.

43:07.557 --> 43:09.926
See?

43:09.927 --> 43:12.128
- I've stopped.
- Nothing.

43:15.816 --> 43:18.851
- Now I have a pulse.
- It's me again.

43:20.070 --> 43:22.721
- Now?
- Nothing.

43:24.775 --> 43:26.692
Her heart won't take back up again.

43:26.693 --> 43:29.862
Her lungs won't cooperate. She's gone.

43:29.863 --> 43:32.665
What a terrible waste.

43:32.666 --> 43:35.785
Come here, Bertie. Give it a try.

43:35.786 --> 43:38.788
At least we can salvage
something from the misery.

43:38.789 --> 43:41.457
Just push through and
when you feel her heart,

43:41.458 --> 43:44.160
just squeeze it gently.

43:49.633 --> 43:51.834
I have a pulse.

43:56.139 --> 43:58.507
We'll find a use for it.

44:10.620 --> 44:12.771
Ahem.

44:14.458 --> 44:16.208
Quite a day.

44:16.209 --> 44:19.828
I'm sure some of what you saw was shocking.

44:20.964 --> 44:23.883
It was nothing of the sort.

44:23.884 --> 44:26.168
I started in a place that makes

44:26.169 --> 44:28.587
your benighted Knickerbocker
look like a utopia.

44:28.588 --> 44:32.174
I will myself to remember
it with crystal clarity

44:32.175 --> 44:35.094
so that I will never
choose any course in my life

44:35.095 --> 44:37.229
that would bring me back
to that horrible place.

44:37.230 --> 44:40.066
I climbed out of there so
that you could have options

44:40.067 --> 44:42.519
that I only dreamed of.

44:42.520 --> 44:44.603
And I choose the Knick.

44:44.604 --> 44:46.605
For what?

44:46.606 --> 44:48.324
Romance?

44:48.325 --> 44:50.776
The idea that there's some sort of nobility

44:50.777 --> 44:52.194
in poverty, in the struggle?

44:52.195 --> 44:53.696
Believe me, there is no such thing.

44:53.697 --> 44:55.664
There is only poverty in poverty

44:55.665 --> 44:57.083
and struggle in struggle.

44:57.084 --> 44:59.870
And one day you'll wake up and realize that

44:59.871 --> 45:02.788
and it'll be too late.

45:02.789 --> 45:05.758
Thackery is doing things
no other surgeon is doing.

45:05.759 --> 45:07.843
And with good reason.

45:07.844 --> 45:10.296
How he defiled that girl.

45:10.297 --> 45:13.383
He's a showman, nothing more.

45:13.384 --> 45:17.186
All Thackery wants is
a goo-goo-eyed puppy,

45:17.187 --> 45:19.105
and he has that in you.

45:19.106 --> 45:20.723
How he treats you.

45:20.724 --> 45:23.392
How they all do. It was
sickening to watch them.

45:23.393 --> 45:26.929
You not only allow them to call
you Bertie, you encourage it.

45:27.981 --> 45:30.116
They mean it with affection.

45:30.117 --> 45:32.701
They mean it with scorn.

45:32.702 --> 45:34.620
You are a physician.

45:34.621 --> 45:36.073
And my son.

45:36.074 --> 45:37.957
And you should be addressed at all times

45:37.958 --> 45:40.543
as Dr. Bertram Chickering Jr.

45:40.544 --> 45:44.113
Nothing less ever.

45:54.257 --> 45:57.843
- Dr. Edwards.
- Mr. Barrow.

45:57.844 --> 46:00.262
Terrible shame about the young lady.

46:00.263 --> 46:02.398
Yes, it was unfortunate.

46:04.434 --> 46:07.987
Well, I'm going to make sure

46:07.988 --> 46:11.274
proper arrangements are being made.

46:11.275 --> 46:14.527
Yes, and I am heading to my
office to gather my things.

46:14.528 --> 46:17.446
Mmm. Well, good evening.

46:17.447 --> 46:19.481
And you.

47:03.126 --> 47:05.361
Awful, isn't it?

47:08.582 --> 47:10.866
Number 11 is mine.

47:12.919 --> 47:15.504
I don't know what you mean.

47:22.345 --> 47:26.599
Do you have any idea
what the going price is

47:26.600 --> 47:29.385
for a fresh body these days?

47:31.404 --> 47:34.022
We can split it if you like.

47:37.410 --> 47:39.528
Fuck it.

48:09.726 --> 48:11.860
Harry.

48:11.861 --> 48:14.096
Let's go for a ride.

48:14.814 --> 48:17.533
I need you.

48:17.534 --> 48:19.652
You ever been down here before?

48:19.653 --> 48:21.904
No.

48:21.905 --> 48:23.740
My first job off the boat was doing

48:23.741 --> 48:25.242
what these fellas are doing.

48:25.243 --> 48:28.794
Standing in a hole all
day shoveling the dirt out,

48:28.795 --> 48:31.747
rain, shine, frozen ground,

48:31.748 --> 48:34.967
not giving a shit there
were bodies in them boxes.

48:34.968 --> 48:38.537
Just get the job done fast
so you don't lose a wage.

48:39.422 --> 48:42.007
Used to be all Irishmen digging.

48:42.008 --> 48:44.293
Now it's Polacks.

48:45.095 --> 48:47.430
Where do they bury you nuns?

48:47.431 --> 48:49.982
In one of the church cemeteries.

48:49.983 --> 48:52.601
I'm sure it's quite a to-do.

48:52.602 --> 48:54.987
Religious folk, family,

48:54.988 --> 48:57.806
all coming to say their last.

48:58.942 --> 49:01.360
She ain't got no one but us.

49:01.361 --> 49:04.496
The girl had no family?

49:04.497 --> 49:06.665
Landlord said she came over alone.

49:06.666 --> 49:09.201
Russia or someplace.

49:09.202 --> 49:11.036
Didn't even know her last name.

49:11.037 --> 49:14.256
Getting her rent money,
that was good enough.

49:14.257 --> 49:15.792
There's a whole family somewhere

49:15.793 --> 49:18.177
thinks their girl's
alive and well in America.

49:18.178 --> 49:19.796
Shame.

49:19.797 --> 49:22.348
This whole place is
full of shames like her.

49:22.349 --> 49:25.017
All coming here hoping to Christ

49:25.018 --> 49:27.186
the stories they heard is true.

49:27.187 --> 49:29.021
Thinking that every fucking plonker

49:29.022 --> 49:32.725
who steps off the dock trips
dead into a bucket of money.

49:32.726 --> 49:34.644
But then you get here

49:34.645 --> 49:36.862
and it ain't that.

49:36.863 --> 49:38.731
And if you ain't strong enough,

49:38.732 --> 49:43.185
this city will bugger you 18
different ways and leave you to rot.

49:44.371 --> 49:46.823
Where's the fucking dignity?

49:46.824 --> 49:49.942
Today wasn't an easy day.

49:50.994 --> 49:54.797
I have seen some crazy, bad shit, Sister.

49:54.798 --> 49:57.249
Set it down easy. Set it down easy.

49:57.250 --> 49:59.885
But the look in that girl's eyes,

49:59.886 --> 50:02.087
the terror,

50:02.088 --> 50:05.507
that was too much even for me.

50:05.508 --> 50:07.593
Now you know why I do
what I do for these girls.

50:07.594 --> 50:09.762
Don't go justifying your baby murdering.

50:09.763 --> 50:11.847
I still don't like it.

50:11.848 --> 50:14.566
But I won't see another girl
bleeding to death and winding up here.

50:14.567 --> 50:17.436
So how's about this... I find
the girls needing services

50:17.437 --> 50:20.656
and you do the job on them, good and safe.

50:20.657 --> 50:23.409
Still a 60-40 split in your favor?

50:23.410 --> 50:26.328
It's fair play.

50:26.329 --> 50:28.497
How's I see it, you got a far better chance

50:28.498 --> 50:30.999
of meeting Saint Peter than I'll ever have.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.118
I'll need the extra to live good down here

50:33.119 --> 50:36.039
before I head wherever I'm going.

50:36.040 --> 50:40.542
She was clutching hard to this saint

50:40.543 --> 50:42.911
around her neck when we picked her up.

50:43.847 --> 50:46.515
She must have been a believer.

50:46.516 --> 50:49.217
Or at least today she was.

50:51.388 --> 50:54.057
Theodore the Black.

50:54.058 --> 50:56.642
He became a monk at the end of his life

50:56.643 --> 50:59.562
and repented his wicked ways.

50:59.563 --> 51:01.763
If there was hope for him...

51:03.533 --> 51:05.901
Afraid not, Harry.

51:05.902 --> 51:08.238
Even so,

51:08.239 --> 51:11.490
would you like to say
something or should I?

51:12.876 --> 51:15.494
You and I both know it'd be
hypocritical coming from me.

51:15.495 --> 51:17.663
Do her more harm than good.

51:17.664 --> 51:20.549
Hey, you boys want to fuck away off?

51:20.550 --> 51:22.951
The sister wants to say a prayer.

51:26.973 --> 51:29.791
Give her some smart words to go on her way.

51:32.929 --> 51:34.646
O God,

51:34.647 --> 51:36.598
by Your mercy,

51:36.599 --> 51:39.351
rest is given to the souls of the faithful.

51:40.236 --> 51:42.938
Be pleased to bless this grave.

51:44.023 --> 51:47.444
Appoint Your holy angels to guard it

51:47.445 --> 51:50.696
and set free from all the chains of sin

51:50.697 --> 51:53.499
the soul of her whose body is buried here.

51:53.500 --> 51:56.585
So with all Thy saints

51:56.586 --> 51:59.738
she may rejoice in Thee forever.

52:00.957 --> 52:03.625
Through Christ our Lord, Amen.

52:05.762 --> 52:07.579
Right.

53:00.767 --> 53:03.218
Good night, Nurse Elkins.

53:06.689 --> 53:09.224
467 Mott Street.
