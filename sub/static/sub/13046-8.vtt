This is Jacob Barnes,
reporting live for AMT News

00:32.246 --> 00:33.545
from the St. Louis White House,

00:33.570 --> 00:35.170
where mourners are being allowed in

00:35.195 --> 00:37.229
to pay their respects
to the late President.

00:37.795 --> 00:39.328
As we await further details

00:39.370 --> 00:41.209
in the apparent suicide
of Jeffrey Michener,

00:41.234 --> 00:42.734
AMT News has confirmed

00:43.053 --> 00:45.921
that the American hostages
in Asia have been rescued.

00:46.558 --> 00:48.825
It is unclear
whether the President was aware

00:48.861 --> 00:51.094
of this good news
at the time of his death.

00:51.258 --> 00:53.425
In the absence of any final note
or message,

00:53.461 --> 00:54.893
we can only speculate.

00:55.209 --> 00:57.740
It seems that the pressures
of his embattled agenda,

00:57.765 --> 00:59.888
coupled with this network's revelations

01:00.138 --> 01:03.059
of his culpability
in the Doak Stadium disaster,

01:03.084 --> 01:05.552
may have proved too much
for the President to bear.

01:10.409 --> 01:13.285
Vice President Oliver just transferred
to the C-130 in Panama.

01:13.310 --> 01:15.266
He should be on the ground
in St. Louis in 4 1/2 hours.

01:15.291 --> 01:16.724
Is Judge Watkins on board?

01:16.967 --> 01:19.166
She's administering
the Oath of Office as we speak.

01:19.191 --> 01:20.623
Good. That's good.

01:24.678 --> 01:26.615
Please gather
all of our background and Intel

01:26.640 --> 01:28.248
on Peng and our Asian players.

01:28.332 --> 01:29.888
President Oliver is gonna need
to get up to speed

01:29.913 --> 01:31.224
before he speaks
to the regional leaders.

01:31.249 --> 01:32.474
Yes, ma'am.

02:01.334 --> 02:03.935
I've served under six presidents.

02:03.970 --> 02:06.357
Jeffrey Michener's the only one
I ever...

02:06.577 --> 02:08.086
shook hands with.

02:09.225 --> 02:13.394
The people of New China
send our deepest respect

02:13.419 --> 02:16.427
and condolences
to our brothers and sisters

02:16.763 --> 02:18.209
in America.

02:18.451 --> 02:21.202
It is with great sadness
that we have learned

02:21.237 --> 02:24.138
of the death
of President Jeffrey Michener.

02:24.553 --> 02:27.354
President Michener
was an important ally.

02:27.529 --> 02:29.013
He's still in the mansion.

02:29.725 --> 02:31.287
There's no way
we're getting back in there,

02:31.312 --> 02:32.334
if that's what you're thinking.

02:32.359 --> 02:33.912
We're in tomahawk range.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.950
Tom, we don't even know
if he's actually there.

02:36.975 --> 02:39.242
He might have released this video
to bait us into attacking him.

02:39.277 --> 02:40.810
Happy to call that bluff.

02:40.936 --> 02:43.270
Okay, you take Peng out,
his number two continues

02:43.297 --> 02:45.664
with whatever their agenda is,
and we've just started a hot war

02:45.700 --> 02:47.052
without knowing what their plans are,

02:47.077 --> 02:49.412
why those boats are so important
to him, what he's smuggling.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.466
She's right.

02:50.491 --> 02:52.324
Much as I'd like
to take Peng out right now,

02:52.635 --> 02:54.763
we got to find Wu Ming first,
get to the bottom of this.

02:54.788 --> 02:57.455
That son of a bitch has been
pummeling us for 10 rounds,

02:57.480 --> 02:59.785
and I'm not much in the mood
to wait for his knockout punch.

02:59.810 --> 03:01.084
What about all the innocent people

03:01.109 --> 03:02.675
in and around the mansion
when your tomahawk hits?

03:04.373 --> 03:06.412
We can't just assassinate
a foreign leader

03:06.451 --> 03:08.396
without consulting
with the Commander in Chief.

03:13.498 --> 03:15.607
Find me when you get close to Shanzhai.

03:21.671 --> 03:23.137
He blames himself.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.607
For what?

03:24.632 --> 03:26.427
Pushing Michener too hard...

03:26.452 --> 03:28.051
before he was ready.

03:28.919 --> 03:30.151
Did he?

03:30.430 --> 03:31.912
Country needed a president.

03:35.091 --> 03:37.826
Maybe we should find a plane,
get Tom to St. Louis.

03:37.872 --> 03:39.888
He could help Oliver get his bearings,

03:40.193 --> 03:42.060
give him some credibility.

03:42.841 --> 03:43.912
You saw.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.607
He's not going anywhere,

03:46.632 --> 03:48.146
not till we finish this.

04:12.652 --> 04:15.410
Obviously, Jeffrey Michener's
are big shoes to fill,

04:15.525 --> 04:17.855
but Howard Oliver
is beloved here in St. Louis,

04:17.880 --> 04:19.644
where, as Mayor, he oversaw

04:19.668 --> 04:21.773
the most effective quarantine
in the country,

04:22.238 --> 04:24.643
saving over 100,000 people
during the plague.

04:37.399 --> 04:39.128
It wasn't the first time.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.285
He tried to kill himself
on the <i> Nathan James.</i>

04:43.316 --> 04:44.446
He slit his wrists.

04:44.471 --> 04:47.034
When Captain Chandler found him,
he'd nearly bled to death.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.109
I had no idea.
I...

04:55.834 --> 04:57.267
I was on the ship. I...

04:57.302 --> 04:58.699
They kept it quiet.

05:00.742 --> 05:02.733
Only the senior leadership knew.

05:05.374 --> 05:07.636
Jeffrey told me when he felt...

05:07.661 --> 05:09.300
that he could finally trust me.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.591
I'm telling you this

05:16.616 --> 05:19.027
because you need to stop
beating yourself up.

05:20.211 --> 05:21.808
If anything, I'm the one.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.863
I knew he was suffering.

05:27.465 --> 05:29.425
I knew, and I left him alone.

05:35.758 --> 05:37.316
Were the two of you...?

05:45.078 --> 05:47.347
I'm so sorry, Allison.

06:01.191 --> 06:02.784
This one's a bust, too.

06:03.794 --> 06:05.093
Damn it.

06:05.118 --> 06:06.651
Hey, Doc.

06:07.433 --> 06:08.683
Is this something you need?

06:09.152 --> 06:10.651
Uh, that's, um...

06:11.246 --> 06:12.478
that's, uh...

06:13.349 --> 06:14.949
I-I don't even know
what that is.

06:14.974 --> 06:17.003
Dr. Scott never let me touch
that machine.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.694
But I'm getting warmer?

06:20.191 --> 06:21.581
Yeah, sure.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.683
Yeah, hello.

06:24.958 --> 06:26.291
Hey, Doc.

06:26.389 --> 06:28.808
Looks like we got
a stowaway here, mate.

06:32.941 --> 06:34.136
Okay.

06:34.238 --> 06:35.441
This is very, very good.

06:35.466 --> 06:36.909
This is a really good start.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.034
Um...

06:40.723 --> 06:42.505
Could you guys start setting
this up over here for me?

06:42.506 --> 06:44.039
- Yeah. You got it.
- Thanks.

06:46.464 --> 06:47.855
You wanted to see me?

06:48.723 --> 06:50.464
Kyoko has something to say to you.

06:50.465 --> 06:51.898
She asked me to translate.

06:58.863 --> 07:00.889
She says that you saved her life,

07:00.914 --> 07:02.816
but more importantly,
you saved her son.

07:02.868 --> 07:04.394
That was all Logan and Rios.

07:04.419 --> 07:05.925
I-I didn't really
do much.

07:14.113 --> 07:17.152
She says she hasn't prayed
since she was a child,

07:18.082 --> 07:20.714
but now she will, every day,
for the doctors and for you.

07:25.122 --> 07:27.150
No, please. You don't
have to get up. It's okay.

07:27.175 --> 07:29.058
Um, ma'am.
It's, uh...

07:50.441 --> 07:51.430
Hey.

07:53.568 --> 07:55.409
She says you're a natural.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.642
Seems like the weather
matches our mood.

09:00.972 --> 09:02.425
Welcome home, Mr. President.

09:02.450 --> 09:04.016
Thank you.

09:08.417 --> 09:12.205
The world's lost a great leader,
but we in this room...

09:12.558 --> 09:15.355
we've lost a colleague and a friend.

09:15.566 --> 09:17.132
You all served him well,

09:17.157 --> 09:20.058
and I look forward to continuing
the work you began together,

09:20.159 --> 09:23.839
as we navigate our way
through this difficult time.

09:43.824 --> 09:47.113
I'll need all of your help
getting up to speed, but first,

09:47.767 --> 09:50.144
I'll need to speak to Captain Chandler.

09:52.745 --> 09:54.191
St. Louis connected, sir.

09:55.808 --> 09:57.339
This is Captain Chandler.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.824
Stand by for the President.

10:00.785 --> 10:02.160
Captain Chandler.

10:02.414 --> 10:03.680
Mr. President.

10:04.138 --> 10:06.324
I am so very sorry.

10:06.597 --> 10:09.191
I know how close you and Jeffrey were.

10:10.047 --> 10:11.847
I hope that over time,

10:11.872 --> 10:14.933
I can earn the trust and confidence

10:15.074 --> 10:16.722
that you and he shared.

10:17.449 --> 10:18.503
Yes, sir.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.785
I have a lot to catch you up on.

10:21.820 --> 10:24.688
We're currently approaching
the pirate haven of Shanzhai,

10:24.723 --> 10:26.347
where we intend to find a smuggler

10:26.372 --> 10:28.191
who goes by the name of Wu Ming.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.924
We think he might be able
to help fill in the blanks

10:30.949 --> 10:32.849
about why our people were taken,

10:32.884 --> 10:35.061
about ships painted with black circles,

10:35.086 --> 10:37.653
and what President Peng
is planning in Asia.

10:38.127 --> 10:39.971
Sir, I intend to complete the mission

10:39.996 --> 10:42.042
that was given to me
by President Michener...

10:42.909 --> 10:44.306
with your permission.

10:45.425 --> 10:48.836
You have my permission
and my gratitude.

10:50.089 --> 10:51.768
Thank you,
Mr. President.

10:59.824 --> 11:02.738
We're 27 nautical miles
southeast of Shanzhai port, sir.

11:03.918 --> 11:06.074
Vulture team is standing by
for Captain Chandler.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.539
Ready for infil as soon
as Nomad has eyes on target.

11:08.607 --> 11:09.628
All right. Listen up!

11:09.653 --> 11:12.097
We got a high-value
target-capture mission.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.988
After beach entry,
we silent patrol to the target,

11:15.037 --> 11:16.436
penetrate the perimeter defense,

11:16.472 --> 11:18.332
and we capture
that son of a bitch Wu Ming.

11:18.357 --> 11:19.863
We'll have an immediate Helo EXFIL.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.785
Last time we were in Shanzhai,
it got hot fast,

11:23.102 --> 11:24.339
so watch your six.

11:26.199 --> 11:28.386
<i>Nathan James,</i> this is Nomad.

11:28.411 --> 11:31.511
Going feet dry
six clicks from Shanzhai.

11:34.831 --> 11:37.464
- Sonar.
- Nothing on sub surface.

11:37.910 --> 11:39.628
Radar tracking surface contact

11:39.653 --> 11:42.839
bearing 2-5-8
heading 0-1-4 at 18 knots.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.003
AIS classifies it
as a shrimp cutter, sir.

11:46.028 --> 11:48.035
We are not taking any chances.

11:48.060 --> 11:51.495
All stations continue to track
and monitor that vessel.

11:51.571 --> 11:52.870
CNO on the bridge.

11:53.617 --> 11:54.705
You get the go from POTUS?

11:54.730 --> 11:56.863
He understands the importance
of what we're doing here

11:56.899 --> 11:58.632
but has requested
proof-of-life videos.

11:58.988 --> 12:01.001
It's a morale boost for back home.

12:01.559 --> 12:03.613
Land team's waiting for you.

12:04.073 --> 12:06.573
<i>Nathan James,</i> this is Nomad.

12:06.609 --> 12:07.824
Flag on the play.

12:09.214 --> 12:11.011
Shanzhai's a bust.

12:11.652 --> 12:13.449
Place is a fire pit.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.098
The whole town?

12:15.122 --> 12:16.331
Wiped out.

12:17.163 --> 12:18.738
Nothing but ashes.

12:19.629 --> 12:21.972
Nomad returning to ship.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.855
He carpet-bombed everybody
to get one guy?

12:29.175 --> 12:31.206
Peng leveled Shanzhai.

12:31.698 --> 12:34.094
Charred the place to tie up loose ends.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.553
We assume Wu Ming's dead,

12:36.597 --> 12:37.763
but we still need to figure out

12:37.799 --> 12:39.564
how he tracked all those ships,

12:39.589 --> 12:42.178
especially the ones
he wanted you to stay away from.

12:42.574 --> 12:46.008
Any idea if he might've had
a backup outside Shanzhai?

12:50.824 --> 12:52.724
It's a Chinese proverb.

12:53.450 --> 12:55.902
Wu Ming taught me this when I asked...

12:56.640 --> 13:00.109
why he never pirated the ships himself.

13:00.761 --> 13:02.160
It means...

13:03.705 --> 13:06.503
"When children travel far from home,

13:07.033 --> 13:10.503
mothers never
stop worrying."

13:13.050 --> 13:15.902
So he was a mama's boy. Mm.

13:15.965 --> 13:17.898
He supported her...

13:18.074 --> 13:20.824
his sister, the grandmother.

13:21.139 --> 13:23.691
And you think he may have
stashed Intel with them.

13:24.108 --> 13:27.409
That way, they could
carry on the business.

13:28.445 --> 13:31.725
He could provide for them,
even in death.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.722
It's the only good thing
I ever heard about him.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.013
Took care of his family.

13:35.701 --> 13:39.027
And where exactly
might we find Mama Ming?

13:49.137 --> 13:50.886
<i>Nathan James</i> will loiter
over the horizon

13:50.911 --> 13:52.796
while a VBSS team commandeers a vehicle

13:52.821 --> 13:53.988
near the Beng Mu Cun inlet

13:54.013 --> 13:56.847
and then heads inland to Yunma
to find Wu Ming's family.

13:59.794 --> 14:02.370
Just awaiting your approval, sir.

14:02.647 --> 14:03.799
Yes.

14:05.972 --> 14:08.370
Commander Green...
how are we doing

14:08.395 --> 14:11.580
on those proof-of-life videos
from the rescued hostages?

14:11.605 --> 14:13.772
The <i> Nathan James</i> crew
is working on them, sir,

14:13.918 --> 14:15.285
but we are having some difficulty

14:15.310 --> 14:16.785
with the visual signal on our end.

14:16.865 --> 14:18.660
I can get the audio recordings
for you right away.

14:18.685 --> 14:21.285
Audio isn't good enough.
We need to see faces.

14:21.310 --> 14:23.753
The American people need to see
that we had a win.

14:23.837 --> 14:25.675
Sort out that technical glitch

14:25.699 --> 14:27.082
A.S.A.P.

14:27.609 --> 14:28.768
Yes, sir.

14:30.746 --> 14:31.722
Okay, Miller.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.120
This is for everybody back home,

14:33.145 --> 14:35.012
so they know
you're still taking up space.

14:35.451 --> 14:37.011
All right. Go ahead. Start talking.

14:37.847 --> 14:40.066
Hey, Ma.
Now, don't be scared.

14:40.112 --> 14:41.706
I know my face is a little messed up,

14:41.731 --> 14:43.160
but the doc promised that I'll go back

14:43.185 --> 14:45.238
to being just as pretty
as I was before.

14:45.725 --> 14:48.058
So, uh, Freak from Spider Man,
basically.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.558
Okay, man. A little respect.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.149
This is for my mother.

14:51.608 --> 14:53.241
Hey, Ma.
Now, don't be scared.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.458
I know my face is a little messed up,

14:55.494 --> 14:57.847
- but the doc promised...
- Can you see anything at all?

14:57.872 --> 14:59.722
- Just as pretty as I was before.
- Still nothing.

15:00.050 --> 15:01.583
Okay, man.
A little respect.

15:01.978 --> 15:03.378
There it is again.

15:04.496 --> 15:06.433
I miss you, Mom.
I love you.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.964
Isn't this the same problem
you were working on with Val?

15:08.989 --> 15:12.050
Yes, but there's hundreds
of hours of data to analyze,

15:12.075 --> 15:14.509
so we haven't been able
to figure out what's causing it.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.972
With her gone...

15:16.320 --> 15:18.347
Damn. System just crashed.

15:18.410 --> 15:20.714
I need to run downstairs
to the communication room.

15:22.426 --> 15:23.592
Hurry, Dennis.

15:23.627 --> 15:24.995
We need to fix this.

15:25.020 --> 15:25.986
Please.

15:26.341 --> 15:28.449
How you holding up over there?

15:30.469 --> 15:31.878
Alisha...

15:35.185 --> 15:37.191
I'm the one who found Michener.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.596
Oh, my...

15:41.700 --> 15:43.100
Kara.

15:44.202 --> 15:45.468
I'm sorry.

15:45.816 --> 15:49.199
You're over there risking your lives.
I'm sitting at a desk.

15:50.044 --> 15:51.410
- I shouldn't...
- No.

15:51.435 --> 15:54.269
We need you there now more than ever.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.863
Vulture team has reached Yunma.

16:05.175 --> 16:06.340
ETA to target?

16:06.365 --> 16:08.003
Less than five minutes, sir.

16:33.643 --> 16:34.683
Clear.

16:34.708 --> 16:35.550
Go.

17:00.017 --> 17:01.316
That's MSS.

17:01.341 --> 17:03.839
I guess Peng wants
to talk to Mama Ming, too.

17:25.855 --> 17:27.183
Well...

17:28.102 --> 17:30.378
he's still alive.

17:39.081 --> 17:40.745
All teams SITREP, over.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.214
Cooper, set.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.963
Green, set.

17:44.621 --> 17:47.019
Taylor, go for entry.

17:51.441 --> 17:53.659
Burk's got eyes on upper target.

17:53.684 --> 17:55.777
I got the shot on the lower.

17:55.802 --> 17:57.601
Burk, go.

18:19.167 --> 18:20.652
Taylor, set.

18:24.432 --> 18:26.511
Primary entry team set.

18:26.995 --> 18:29.449
All teams, on my count.

18:30.171 --> 18:34.191
Three, two, one... execute.

21:01.971 --> 21:03.565
How you feeling, Wu Ming?

21:03.906 --> 21:05.471
Grateful we saved your life?

21:15.881 --> 21:17.714
He says you brought them to his door.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.377
It's you who got everybody
in Shanzhai killed.

21:20.471 --> 21:22.171
I didn't start this.

21:22.269 --> 21:23.479
You and Peng did.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.283
Why was Lau Hu torturing you?

21:38.145 --> 21:39.971
Lottery tickets!

21:40.447 --> 21:42.549
How the hell does lottery
even work now,

21:42.833 --> 21:44.494
when there's barely any currency?

21:44.519 --> 21:46.886
I've seen it in Hong Kong, mate.

21:46.911 --> 21:48.627
People put in whatever they have...

21:48.909 --> 21:50.542
A chicken, a bag of rice.

21:50.815 --> 21:52.882
They get a ticket, a number's drawn.

21:53.034 --> 21:54.737
Whoever wins takes the entire pot...

21:54.909 --> 21:58.041
after the proprietor skims some
off the top, of course.

21:58.746 --> 22:01.455
Tell me about black circles on ships.

22:08.238 --> 22:10.472
He's hiding something.

22:12.712 --> 22:15.860
What's so precious
about those marked ships?

22:16.737 --> 22:19.098
Why would Peng go to all this trouble?

22:35.479 --> 22:37.744
Why are you still protecting Peng?

22:37.878 --> 22:39.955
After everything he's done to you?

22:40.435 --> 22:41.721
I know nothing.

22:41.824 --> 22:43.713
Nothing. Nothing!

23:01.286 --> 23:03.086
That look like a hull number to you?

23:03.845 --> 23:05.278
Yes, it does.

23:06.314 --> 23:07.955
These digits here.

23:08.490 --> 23:10.524
These are coordinates...

23:10.606 --> 23:13.862
for the Strait of Malacca,
the biggest shipping lane in the region.

23:14.132 --> 23:16.557
It's the Intel
Wu Ming sells to pirates.

23:16.582 --> 23:17.885
If each one of these lottery tickets

23:17.910 --> 23:20.080
represents a ship and its location...

23:33.688 --> 23:34.947
Jackpot.

23:36.745 --> 23:38.033
Sir.

23:56.964 --> 23:58.297
You all right?

23:58.332 --> 24:00.423
I could have done without
Rivera's eulogy.

24:00.448 --> 24:02.948
Seems like he's already
jocking for favor.

24:03.718 --> 24:05.617
I noticed that our lone senator

24:05.653 --> 24:08.253
was conspicuously absent
from the funeral.

24:08.289 --> 24:09.621
I spoke to BEATTY.

24:09.657 --> 24:12.345
There was an attack
on a ration-card facility

24:12.370 --> 24:13.569
in Bellingham.

24:13.604 --> 24:15.330
He's sitting on a powder keg up there.

24:15.355 --> 24:16.565
He, uh, he couldn't get away.

24:16.590 --> 24:19.128
Maybe, or maybe sending a signal

24:19.153 --> 24:20.920
that he's not in support
of our administration.

24:20.945 --> 24:23.151
Well, the senator
wasn't particularly fond

24:23.176 --> 24:25.651
of how the last president
used him as a rubber stamp.

24:25.915 --> 24:27.882
- Meaning?
- Sir, you've been away.

24:27.907 --> 24:30.238
I don't think you realize
what a mess this country is in.

24:30.263 --> 24:33.000
Maybe they don't remember what
a mess we had five months ago,

24:33.025 --> 24:35.576
before Michener and the James
came home with the cure.

24:35.601 --> 24:36.934
No, they remember, sir.

24:36.969 --> 24:38.436
And they're grateful for the cure,

24:38.692 --> 24:40.190
but that doesn't give the government

24:40.215 --> 24:42.070
a free pass for everything else,

24:42.473 --> 24:45.127
especially since people think
that most of the decisions

24:45.152 --> 24:47.596
that have come out of here
have been disastrous.

24:47.621 --> 24:50.010
Hell, you can't even prove
you rescued your own people.

24:50.260 --> 24:51.791
The pirates broadcast their faces

24:51.816 --> 24:52.947
from a jungle across the globe,

24:52.972 --> 24:55.487
and you can't manage a Skype
call from a $3 billion warship?

24:55.559 --> 24:57.729
We're working nonstop
on the issue, Mr. President.

24:57.790 --> 24:59.189
I'm confident
we'll have it solved shortly.

24:59.214 --> 25:01.268
Let's not lose the forest
for the trees.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.026
We're all pleased
that the hostages are safe,

25:04.131 --> 25:06.231
and we're sure you'll sort that out.

25:06.571 --> 25:09.105
The more pressing issue
is our domestic policy.

25:09.323 --> 25:12.892
I think we can all agree
that Michener jumped too quickly

25:12.917 --> 25:14.350
to federalize everything.

25:14.784 --> 25:16.729
If you were to curb
some of his measures,

25:16.754 --> 25:19.557
I'm sure it would go a long way
to smoothing things over

25:19.582 --> 25:22.526
with Senator BEATTY
and the American people.

25:22.664 --> 25:27.433
The ration-card program has been
the chief cause of unrest,

25:27.602 --> 25:29.768
and the limits to bank withdrawals...

25:29.793 --> 25:31.572
The people do not want the government

25:31.597 --> 25:33.713
interfering with
how they spend their money.

25:33.738 --> 25:35.213
Come on, Alex. It's all of it.

25:35.245 --> 25:37.348
The land-claim issues
are just as contentious.

25:37.373 --> 25:38.768
What do you all want?

25:39.948 --> 25:41.658
To go back
to dog-eat-dog?

25:42.238 --> 25:44.639
That's appealing when
you're at the top of the heap,

25:45.072 --> 25:47.143
but there are people out there
going hungry

25:47.168 --> 25:49.424
while we are producing more than
enough food to feed everyone.

25:49.878 --> 25:52.549
That's why President Michener
started those ration cards,

25:53.115 --> 25:55.541
so that all of our citizens
can have their fair share

25:55.566 --> 25:56.682
of what they need to get b...

25:56.707 --> 25:57.885
Commander Green.

26:01.223 --> 26:04.354
If we need your advice
as it pertains to our military,

26:04.572 --> 26:05.712
we'll ask for it.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.707
Sir, I know that you were skittish

26:13.773 --> 26:16.846
about instituting these policies
from the beginning.

26:16.871 --> 26:18.869
It doesn't matter what I thought then

26:18.894 --> 26:20.658
or if they're unpopular.

26:22.639 --> 26:24.260
Are they working or not?

26:29.917 --> 26:31.807
I think it's fair to say
that these policies

26:31.832 --> 26:34.479
are doing more harm than good, sir.

26:39.327 --> 26:40.526
What happened in there?

26:40.721 --> 26:42.099
Everything we worked for,

26:42.131 --> 26:44.097
everything
President Michener stood for.

26:44.126 --> 26:45.447
We're in a crisis.

26:45.448 --> 26:47.432
It's our job
to hold the country together.

26:47.808 --> 26:51.229
You sat with the President
and wrote those policies.

26:51.541 --> 26:52.783
You didn't fight for them.

26:52.808 --> 26:54.679
If President Michener
couldn't make them work,

26:54.704 --> 26:56.416
then Howard Oliver certainly can't.

26:58.243 --> 26:59.690
So you're gonna let Oliver

26:59.715 --> 27:01.619
capitulate to the regional leaders.

27:03.306 --> 27:05.760
He just gave them authority
over local militias

27:05.785 --> 27:07.369
without speaking to Captain Chandler.

27:07.394 --> 27:08.986
Chandler's the acting head
of our military,

27:09.011 --> 27:10.190
and he never would have allowed it.

27:10.215 --> 27:13.116
Captain Chandler is 12,000 miles away.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.401
The regional leaders need to
be able to call their own shots.

27:15.426 --> 27:17.526
If they can't control
their own regions, who will?

27:17.551 --> 27:20.166
They're the ones stoking the unrest.
President Michener...

27:20.191 --> 27:21.791
President Michener isn't here!

27:22.658 --> 27:24.322
He took the easy way out!

27:24.577 --> 27:25.987
So if they sit in that office

27:26.012 --> 27:28.697
and they reverse every decision
that he made as President,

27:28.722 --> 27:30.627
there's nobody to blame but him.

27:36.065 --> 27:37.189
Sir.

27:37.821 --> 27:40.080
Uh, thank you for coming down.

27:40.531 --> 27:42.314
I've made some progress, sir,

27:42.339 --> 27:45.213
but I-I still have
more questions than answers.

27:45.268 --> 27:49.737
Um, this is an image of our cure
from Dr. Scott's notes.

27:49.812 --> 27:52.862
I've isolated the compound
in Takehaya and Kyoko's blood.

27:52.959 --> 27:54.425
It's exactly the same as ours.

27:54.450 --> 27:56.916
Structurally uncompromised,
as far as I can tell.

27:57.476 --> 28:01.151
This is an image of the red flu
from Dr. Scott's files,

28:01.341 --> 28:02.573
and this...

28:03.086 --> 28:05.651
This is the virus in Kyoko's blood.

28:06.698 --> 28:07.958
It's different.

28:08.157 --> 28:09.971
- Bulkier.
- Exactly.

28:09.996 --> 28:12.864
That bulkiness is present
in Takehaya's virus, as well.

28:13.150 --> 28:16.641
The virus in their blood is
similar enough to the original

28:16.666 --> 28:18.619
that my preliminary tests
identified it,

28:18.781 --> 28:21.349
- but it is somewhat altered.
- A mutation.

28:21.510 --> 28:22.721
I can't say for sure,

28:22.746 --> 28:24.822
but whatever's causing the bulkiness

28:24.847 --> 28:26.713
is preventing the cure from working.

28:26.833 --> 28:28.027
That means everyone on this ship

28:28.051 --> 28:30.121
who's come in contact
with Takehaya could be infected.

28:30.146 --> 28:31.324
That was my worry, too,

28:31.325 --> 28:33.826
but none of us from the
prison camp have any symptoms.

28:34.010 --> 28:37.010
I crossed the virus in Takehaya's blood

28:37.035 --> 28:38.221
with a sample of my own

28:38.246 --> 28:40.151
and from several sailors
who had no contact

28:40.176 --> 28:42.885
with Takehaya, Kyoko,
or any of us who were prisoners.

28:43.291 --> 28:45.596
The bulkier virus doesn't make us sick.

28:46.107 --> 28:49.175
Somehow, the cure in us
defends against it.

28:49.210 --> 28:52.878
If Takehaya and Kyoko
both have the same cure,

28:53.622 --> 28:55.252
why is the virus harming them?

28:55.277 --> 28:56.943
I wish I knew, sir.

28:57.073 --> 28:58.939
I'll keep digging.

28:59.132 --> 29:03.479
We're at 19.83 North
by 112.5 East.

29:03.745 --> 29:06.026
Course 1-0-0,
speed 20 knots, sir.

29:06.051 --> 29:08.690
There's a small land mass here
which should provide cover

29:08.715 --> 29:10.248
from hostile radar detection

29:10.273 --> 29:12.722
while giving us a vantage point
on the shipping lane

29:12.747 --> 29:14.013
indicated on that card.

29:14.047 --> 29:16.047
Helo is standing by
to execute fly overs.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.535
We expect many vessels
to have AIS switched off

29:18.560 --> 29:19.854
on account of pirates.

29:30.760 --> 29:36.791
She's Alpha Charlie Foxtrot 79831396.

29:37.089 --> 29:38.322
Any of the markings?

29:38.347 --> 29:42.010
Uh, just a couple of dings
from a bad parking job.

29:42.334 --> 29:43.900
No black dot.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.018
No dice.

29:46.043 --> 29:48.471
Is it possible the ship
already passed this location?

29:48.496 --> 29:49.893
According to Wu Ming's Intel,

29:49.918 --> 29:51.463
it was last pinged
outside Hainan Harbor

29:51.488 --> 29:53.260
yesterday at 2200 hours.

29:53.385 --> 29:54.908
Even a wave-piercing catamaran

29:54.933 --> 29:56.800
couldn't traverse this
shipping lane that quickly.

29:57.116 --> 30:00.182
Captain, radar's tracking
small surface vessel

30:00.207 --> 30:02.244
approaching our contact point
on the shipping lane.

30:02.682 --> 30:06.262
Nomad, vessel approaching
south at 0-2-5.

30:06.287 --> 30:07.776
Initiate flyover.

30:07.801 --> 30:09.367
Roger that, Nathan James.

30:09.492 --> 30:11.125
Making the turn.

30:15.065 --> 30:16.998
I don't know about this one, Captain.

30:17.048 --> 30:19.705
- What's wrong with it?
- Oh, there's nothing wrong with it,

30:19.730 --> 30:21.931
if you're on spring break in Ibiza.

30:22.075 --> 30:23.510
What the hell's that mean?

30:23.542 --> 30:25.401
It's 120-foot pleasure cruiser.

30:25.426 --> 30:27.593
- No cargo hold.
- Wait a second.

30:28.286 --> 30:33.489
Alpha Zulu Bravo 79863 Lima 309.

30:33.525 --> 30:34.701
That's it.

30:34.726 --> 30:37.815
And we're staring at
a big old dark side of the moon.

31:04.651 --> 31:07.041
Vessel on course 0-1-4 at 22 knots,

31:07.066 --> 31:09.066
this is US Navy Warship 151,

31:09.255 --> 31:10.830
requesting to board for inspection

31:10.855 --> 31:12.737
in accordance with
international law of sea.

31:21.050 --> 31:23.869
Vessel on course 0-1-4 at 22 knots,

31:24.228 --> 31:27.838
I say again,
this is US Navy Warship 151,

31:27.863 --> 31:29.705
requesting to board for inspection

31:29.730 --> 31:32.432
in accordance with
international law of sea.

31:32.457 --> 31:36.315
Uh, TAO, surface track 72871
increasing speed to 25 knots.

31:36.521 --> 31:37.752
Captain... TAO.

31:37.777 --> 31:39.963
Surface contact may be trying
to make a run for it.

31:39.988 --> 31:42.154
XO, let's stick our nose out,
let him know he has company.

31:42.179 --> 31:43.932
OOD, increase speed to 25 knots.

31:43.957 --> 31:45.658
Come to 1,000-yard CPA.

32:04.911 --> 32:08.354
TAO, surface track 72871,
coming to course 045,

32:08.379 --> 32:11.299
- increasing speed to 35 knots.
- They're trying to evade.

32:11.324 --> 32:13.237
Just turn starboard
and increased speed, sir.

32:13.262 --> 32:14.846
Starboard ROC...
Fire mark 38.

32:14.871 --> 32:16.994
One salvo of warning shots
across the bow.

32:17.019 --> 32:18.369
Prepare countermeasures, but do not

32:18.394 --> 32:20.049
under any circumstances sink that ship,

32:20.145 --> 32:22.401
- not till we know what's aboard.
- Aye, captain.

32:22.554 --> 32:24.487
All stations, standby to reengage.

32:36.941 --> 32:38.838
Sir, he's changed course
to 2-5-0.

32:38.863 --> 32:40.315
He's headed for the Yanshi Atoll.

32:40.340 --> 32:42.229
- OOD, all ahead full.
- Sir, we can't outrun him.

32:42.254 --> 32:43.487
He's traveling at 36 knots.

32:43.678 --> 32:45.104
And we can't go into the Atoll.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.651
The coral beds are too shallow.

32:46.676 --> 32:50.096
- XO, time to close the net.
- Nomad, you're a go for approach.

32:50.546 --> 32:53.744
All right, boys and girls,
let's drop in for a cocktail.

33:13.131 --> 33:15.244
TAO, surface tracks vessel 1,000 yards.

33:15.269 --> 33:18.572
Captain, TAO... surface contact
10 degrees relative.

33:25.167 --> 33:27.096
Okay, don't do it, buddy!

33:27.121 --> 33:28.518
Not a good move!

33:29.057 --> 33:30.994
Don't do anything stupid!

33:31.019 --> 33:33.049
- Cut your engine.
- Man.

33:33.074 --> 33:34.240
We are US Navy.

33:34.399 --> 33:36.190
Lay down your weapons!

33:37.059 --> 33:39.971
We don't want to hurt you,
but we will be boarding your vessel.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.295
<i>Nathan James,</i> vessel is surrendering.

33:44.968 --> 33:46.573
Game over, asshole.

33:54.929 --> 33:56.682
Is this even necessary, yo?

33:56.824 --> 33:59.658
Tell us where Peng's cargo is
and we'll stop right now.

34:00.377 --> 34:02.807
Does this even look like
a cargo ship to you?

34:03.536 --> 34:05.042
We tossed the whole vessel.

34:05.196 --> 34:07.677
All we found were a couple more M16s

34:08.049 --> 34:09.387
and a case of Cristal.

34:09.411 --> 34:12.471
- See? What'd I tell you?
- If you've got nothing to hide,

34:12.496 --> 34:14.534
then why run from a US Navy ship?

34:14.559 --> 34:16.181
It's the apocalypse, man.

34:16.770 --> 34:19.213
All kinds of people
get in all kinds of boats

34:19.237 --> 34:20.536
saying all kinds of shit.

34:20.649 --> 34:22.596
You could have been pirates,
for all I know.

34:23.096 --> 34:24.407
This is my boat!

34:24.482 --> 34:25.940
You can't take it from me!

34:26.197 --> 34:27.230
Oh, yeah?

34:27.570 --> 34:29.737
You got bills of sales
for those weapons?

34:30.511 --> 34:32.947
Well, then you're in violation
of international maritime law.

34:33.214 --> 34:35.728
The U.S. Navy has a right
to place you under arrest

34:35.754 --> 34:37.786
and commandeer this vessel.

34:37.812 --> 34:40.088
Hell, no! This is my baby!

34:40.344 --> 34:41.760
Y-You can't do this,
yo!

34:41.833 --> 34:43.199
We sure can, yo.

34:43.224 --> 34:44.960
You want to keep your precious ship,

34:45.187 --> 34:46.667
you start talking.

34:48.630 --> 34:49.900
Americans.

34:50.418 --> 34:52.494
You're so self-righteous.

35:09.572 --> 35:11.208
Move.

35:12.130 --> 35:14.063
Well, that's cocaine.

35:14.088 --> 35:15.143
Heroin.

35:15.168 --> 35:16.801
How much more of this have you got?

35:17.025 --> 35:18.190
Five more crates.

35:18.557 --> 35:21.292
Come on, yo.
This can't even be illegal anymore.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.229
The people have suffered enough.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.760
- I'm just meeting needs.
- Where'd you pick it up?

35:26.503 --> 35:28.456
An island off of Hainan.

35:28.481 --> 35:30.698
Chinese MSS dudes loaded me up.

35:30.723 --> 35:32.424
I don't want to mess with them.

35:41.174 --> 35:43.167
Peng doesn't bother with drugs.

35:44.455 --> 35:46.463
Hey, what are you doing, yo?!

35:46.488 --> 35:47.885
You know what my suppliers
will do to me

35:47.910 --> 35:49.509
if even one of those is missing?

35:49.810 --> 35:51.343
Shut up.

36:07.523 --> 36:09.143
Holy shit!

36:09.678 --> 36:11.456
The missile's clearly been retrofitted

36:11.481 --> 36:12.747
since its manufacture.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.956
Has to be a chemical weapon
of some kind.

36:14.981 --> 36:18.179
He picked up those crates
100 miles southeast of Hainan.

36:18.204 --> 36:19.470
Paraiso Island.

36:19.576 --> 36:21.502
You sure that trafficker
didn't know what was in them?

36:21.873 --> 36:24.768
He was perfectly happy being
a run-of-the-mill drug runner.

36:24.793 --> 36:27.094
Nearly wet himself when we found this.

36:30.167 --> 36:33.034
Those bomblets were designed
in the '60s to carry Sarin.

36:33.522 --> 36:35.022
What do you think the range is
on that missile?

36:35.706 --> 36:38.237
Depending on the weight
of those bomblets, my guess,

36:38.262 --> 36:41.096
it could release high enough
to blanket a 20-mile radius.

36:41.121 --> 36:42.698
You wanted to see me?

36:43.228 --> 36:47.190
Back in Hong Kong, you mentioned
seeing some missiles.

36:47.442 --> 36:49.242
Yellow, with red tips.

36:50.020 --> 36:53.307
These are the same ones
Peng was moving in Guanzhou.

36:54.735 --> 36:56.737
The day my brother was killed.

37:03.058 --> 37:05.091
Green mist.

37:06.503 --> 37:07.784
Kyoko, in her fever...

37:07.809 --> 37:10.667
She was murmuring about a green
mist that came in the night.

38:36.676 --> 38:38.476
The active ingredient
in the green powder

38:38.501 --> 38:40.401
is a specially designed Lectin.

38:40.762 --> 38:43.448
It's binding to the glycoproteins
of the red flu.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.573
That's why the virus looks bulkier.

38:45.769 --> 38:47.302
It hasn't mutated.

38:47.338 --> 38:49.784
The Lectin can create a coating
that shields the virus

38:49.809 --> 38:52.440
from the effects of the antibody
that our cure produces.

38:52.465 --> 38:54.667
I couldn't see it because
I didn't know what I was looking for.

38:54.698 --> 38:57.087
- But if somebody already has the cure?
- Then they're safe.

38:57.112 --> 38:58.845
You'd have to have the Lectin
in your bloodstream first

38:58.881 --> 39:00.313
to render the cure...

39:01.705 --> 39:03.012
ineffective.

39:03.150 --> 39:04.749
That's what Peng's hoarding.

39:05.151 --> 39:07.754
He could fire those missiles
over uncured populations,

39:08.409 --> 39:10.588
so when the cure finally does arrive...

39:10.613 --> 39:11.645
It doesn't work.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.427
That boat was headed to Taiwan
on a run.

39:15.097 --> 39:17.065
Jesse saw the missiles near Vietnam.

39:17.090 --> 39:19.268
And my wife saw the mist in Japan.

39:20.569 --> 39:24.854
By the time we got to the ports
to receive the cure,

39:24.965 --> 39:26.768
it was already too late.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.510
That's right.

39:34.979 --> 39:37.096
I would like to see my wife...

39:38.255 --> 39:39.955
my son.

40:07.074 --> 40:08.323
Good evening, Mr. President.

40:08.348 --> 40:09.971
Commander Green.

40:14.336 --> 40:16.799
The President would like
to keep these briefings

40:16.824 --> 40:19.206
to senior advisors for the time being.

40:20.511 --> 40:22.362
We'll summon you if we need you.

40:32.349 --> 40:35.149
We were welcomed as heroes in Vietnam.

40:35.444 --> 40:37.854
Everyone came out of hiding
to get the cure.

40:40.352 --> 40:42.337
If they were exposed to this...

40:42.362 --> 40:45.370
They spread out across the country
to pass on the contagious cure,

40:45.581 --> 40:48.143
and if they were exposed
to the red flu...

40:49.213 --> 40:50.565
spread that instead.

40:50.833 --> 40:52.292
That was 10 days ago.

40:55.609 --> 40:57.963
And we don't know how many
of these missiles there are.

40:58.879 --> 41:03.215
So... now we know
what Peng's plan is.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.721
It's genocide.
