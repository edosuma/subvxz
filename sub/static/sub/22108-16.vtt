00:20.529 --> 00:22.647
It's a good thing I'm
finally trimming your bangs, Gene.

00:22.724 --> 00:23.978
You probably couldn't
see anything.

00:24.055 --> 00:25.505
- Could you see anything?
- Who's talking?

00:25.582 --> 00:27.907
Personally, I enjoyed watching
you bump into things.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.767
Huh. I feel like I forgot
to do something else important.

00:30.844 --> 00:32.137
Something yesterday.

00:32.214 --> 00:33.820
Did you forget
to take out the trash?

00:33.897 --> 00:35.950
- Did you forget to fart?
- No.

00:36.027 --> 00:37.734
Did you forget where
you came from?

00:37.811 --> 00:40.025
You're from the streets, Mom.
From the streets.

00:40.102 --> 00:42.833
No. Darn it!
It's on the tip of my tongue.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.011
Oh, well. Maybe I'll go
downstairs and ask

00:45.157 --> 00:46.352
your father!

00:46.429 --> 00:48.092
Oh... Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:48.169 --> 00:49.917
What, what? Mom?
Mom! What is it?

00:49.994 --> 00:51.784
- Wh-What... What's happening?
- Y-Yesterday was...

00:51.861 --> 00:53.576
was your father's birthday!

00:53.653 --> 00:56.380
No, it wasn't, that's not
until... Oh, wait, yeah, it was.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.500
It totally was.

00:57.577 --> 00:59.396
I forgot your father's birthday.

00:59.473 --> 01:02.020
No, no, why?

01:02.097 --> 01:03.848
Why, God? No!

01:03.925 --> 01:05.166
I feel bad for Dad.

01:05.242 --> 01:06.365
I feel bad for Mom.

01:06.442 --> 01:08.531
Look at her.
She's a hot mess.

01:09.495 --> 01:11.424
Speaking of hot mess...
Gene, you might

01:11.501 --> 01:13.005
want to take a look
in the mirror real quick.

01:13.082 --> 01:15.303
Aah! My bangs are bungled!

01:15.380 --> 01:17.296
I have bungled bangs!
Why?!

01:17.373 --> 01:19.272
- No, no, no, why?!
- No, no, why?!

01:19.349 --> 01:20.242
Yeah.

01:22.294 --> 01:24.085
- Bob's Burgers.
- Bob, it's Teddy.

01:24.162 --> 01:25.679
- Hey, Teddy.
- I'm sure you noticed

01:25.756 --> 01:27.280
I haven't come in
for a few days.

01:27.357 --> 01:28.881
I did. I mean,
I just noticed.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.301
I'm out of town with my mom.

01:30.378 --> 01:32.232
She signed us up
for a silent retreat.

01:32.309 --> 01:35.165
Teddy, isn't the point of a
silent retreat not to talk?

01:35.242 --> 01:36.634
I'm calling to see if you opened

01:36.711 --> 01:38.646
the birthday e-card that
I sent you yesterday.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.719
Yeah, I was going to, but it
wanted me to download

01:40.796 --> 01:43.035
three new programs...
It just seemed like too many.

01:43.112 --> 01:44.861
It's a picture of a dog
drinking a soda,

01:44.938 --> 01:48.463
a-and when you click on it, he
burps and says "Happy Burpday!"

01:49.226 --> 01:50.913
I-It's a...
It's a little bit of a thinker.

01:50.990 --> 01:52.865
- Yep, that's kind of funny.
- Open it.

01:52.942 --> 01:54.866
I actually am in the middle of
something right now, Teddy.

01:54.943 --> 01:56.397
I'm in one of those
Internet auctions,

01:56.474 --> 01:58.928
trying to get this vintage bacon
weight I've had my eye on.

01:59.005 --> 02:00.956
Geez. You didn't get enough
presents yesterday?

02:01.033 --> 02:02.908
I'm assuming Linda
went all out, right?

02:02.985 --> 02:05.064
Actually, no.
She didn't do anything.

02:05.141 --> 02:07.132
I-It was a little weird.
Maybe she forgot.

02:07.209 --> 02:09.336
Bob, there's no way
Linda forgot your birthday.

02:09.413 --> 02:11.453
Sir, I can't understand
what you're mouthing.

02:11.530 --> 02:12.618
"Get off the phone"?

02:12.695 --> 02:14.448
Okay, Teddy,
I'll talk to you later.

02:14.525 --> 02:15.933
Say hi to your mom for me.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.411
Hey, Mom, Bobby says hi.

02:17.488 --> 02:19.352
Hey, Mom. Mom.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.723
Ma! Mom!

02:23.335 --> 02:24.518
Why?

02:24.595 --> 02:26.336
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Mom.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.821
We forgot his birthday, too,

02:27.898 --> 02:30.071
- if that makes you feel any better.
- It's true.

02:30.148 --> 02:33.266
Oh, it does. No, it doesn't.
There's no excuse.

02:33.343 --> 02:35.469
I can't walk around like this.
This isn't me!

02:35.546 --> 02:37.558
I'm not an Icelandic
punk rocker.

02:37.635 --> 02:40.274
Oh, I'm sorry, Gene.
I'll fix it later.

02:40.351 --> 02:42.661
First I need to fix this
situation with your father.

02:42.738 --> 02:44.183
Why didn't he say anything?

02:44.260 --> 02:46.350
Were there hints or signs
that I missed?

02:46.427 --> 02:49.152
My driver's license
expired today.

02:49.229 --> 02:51.632
Wow, Mister Popular over here.

02:51.709 --> 02:53.139
So glad Facebook reminded me

02:53.216 --> 02:56.018
that it's your special day!

02:56.455 --> 02:57.682
Nope, nothing.

02:57.759 --> 02:59.580
How could we ever
make this up to him?

02:59.657 --> 03:01.630
- Maybe apologize?
- Fake a coma?

03:01.707 --> 03:03.313
Oh! Wait a minute.

03:03.390 --> 03:04.863
I know what we have to do.

03:04.940 --> 03:07.719
We have to give your father
a surprise party. Tonight!

03:07.796 --> 03:09.372
- Tonight?
- Yes, yes, tonight.

03:09.449 --> 03:11.389
We-We just got to get your
father out of the restaurant

03:11.466 --> 03:12.724
for a while.
That way I can say

03:12.801 --> 03:14.742
I was pretending to forget
his birthday,

03:14.819 --> 03:16.694
just to set up
the best surprise ever.

03:16.771 --> 03:18.523
Like the end of that movie,
Seven.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.079
Hi, Bobby.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.316
Hi, guys. Hi, Tina.

03:23.393 --> 03:25.606
You're standing
really close to me.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.277
Hi, Dad.
How are you today?

03:27.354 --> 03:29.219
Hey, you know the guy
who makes the huge bubbles

03:29.296 --> 03:30.437
down at the wharf?

03:30.514 --> 03:32.151
Um, the Bubble Master?

03:32.228 --> 03:33.397
Well, I heard he's making them

03:33.474 --> 03:34.578
bigger than ever these days.

03:34.655 --> 03:35.868
Maybe you should check him out.

03:35.945 --> 03:37.849
That's a great idea, Tina.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.982
Bob, you should go down there
for, uh, three hours.

03:41.059 --> 03:42.914
What? No.
We have to prep for dinner.

03:42.991 --> 03:44.880
Also, everyone knows
the Bubble Master

03:44.957 --> 03:47.028
doesn't work past noon...
He doesn't need to.

03:47.105 --> 03:49.797
He makes a fortune.
I think about him a lot.

03:49.909 --> 03:51.749
- Oh.
- Gene, your hair looks...

03:51.826 --> 03:54.112
uh, great.
"Great" was my first thought.

03:54.189 --> 03:56.219
The people who did this to me
will be prosecuted

03:56.296 --> 03:58.239
to the fullest extent
of the law!

03:58.316 --> 04:00.030
- Damn it.
- What was that?

04:00.107 --> 04:02.015
Oh, just this dumb
online auction.

04:02.115 --> 04:03.945
What are you bidding on...
One of those flashlights

04:04.022 --> 04:05.080
that can blind a bear?

04:05.157 --> 04:06.751
A bunch of Ritalin from Canada?

04:06.828 --> 04:08.364
Just this vintage bacon weight.

04:08.441 --> 04:11.079
- Hello, Belcher family.
- Hi, everyone.

04:11.156 --> 04:12.757
Hi, Hugo. Hi, Ron.

04:12.834 --> 04:13.970
What do you want, Hugo?

04:14.047 --> 04:15.294
Guess what time it is.

04:15.371 --> 04:16.452
W-What time is it?

04:16.529 --> 04:18.576
Health inspection o'clock.

04:18.709 --> 04:20.918
- Hmm.
- Come on, Bob. Let's do this.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.152
All right. Hopefully no one
outbids me on this...

04:23.229 --> 04:24.073
Crap.

04:24.150 --> 04:25.588
Wait, wait.
Uh, hold on, Bob.

04:25.665 --> 04:28.164
Why don't, uh, I just go
with Hugo and Ron,

04:28.241 --> 04:30.287
and, uh, that way
you can stay here,

04:30.364 --> 04:32.180
watch the dining room
and finish your thing.

04:32.257 --> 04:34.102
Oh, uh, great.
Thanks, Lin.

04:34.179 --> 04:36.874
Let's start in the basement,
where molds and bacteria

04:36.951 --> 04:38.352
start their families.

04:38.765 --> 04:41.521
This is weird... everything seems
to be in order down here.

04:41.598 --> 04:42.765
Ron, you find anything?

04:42.842 --> 04:44.236
I thought I saw a dead mouse,

04:44.313 --> 04:46.315
but it was a potato
next to a string bean.

04:46.392 --> 04:48.116
Psst, Hugo, Ron. Come here.

04:48.193 --> 04:49.754
What's going on?
Why are you whispering?

04:49.831 --> 04:51.921
Shh, shh, shh.
I'm planning a surprise party

04:51.998 --> 04:53.668
for Bob's birthday,
and I need to get him out

04:53.745 --> 04:55.042
of the restaurant
for a few hours.

04:55.119 --> 04:56.652
Is there any way
you two could help me?

04:56.729 --> 04:58.193
Help you with Bob's birthday?

04:58.270 --> 04:59.803
Do you have any idea
how uncomfortable

04:59.880 --> 05:01.489
- that would be for me?
- What? Why?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.854
Linda. You and I were
fiancÃ©s once.

05:03.931 --> 05:06.384
Yeah, I remember.
Kinda.

05:06.461 --> 05:09.075
Those were the best four
and a half days of my life.

05:09.152 --> 05:11.429
- Okay.
- And now you want me to help you

05:11.506 --> 05:13.478
- plan a party for your husband?
- Yeah.

05:13.555 --> 05:14.589
- Well then,
- I'm gonna

05:14.666 --> 05:15.977
need something
out of this, too.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.217
- Like fries?
- No, Ron, not like fries!

05:18.294 --> 05:20.246
Okay, Hugo, what is it you want?

05:20.334 --> 05:23.974
I want... I want you

05:24.051 --> 05:25.531
to call my parents.

05:25.608 --> 05:27.443
- What?
- It would make a big impression

05:27.520 --> 05:29.349
if you called and asked them
in a sad,

05:29.426 --> 05:32.186
almost begging tone,
if there's any possible chance

05:32.263 --> 05:33.751
that I'm still single.

05:33.828 --> 05:35.163
Oh, Hugo.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.560
- Oh, Hugo.
- Oh, shut up, Ron.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.562
You know what? I'll do it.
I'll call them.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.163
But only if you can
get Bob away,

05:41.240 --> 05:43.462
and keep him away
until 7:00 tonight.

05:43.539 --> 05:45.173
- Do we have a deal?
- Deal.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.984
- Now, let me hear you do it.
- Do what?

05:47.061 --> 05:48.458
The call.
What're you gonna say?

05:48.535 --> 05:50.875
Oh, uh.
Hello, this is Linda.

05:50.952 --> 05:52.947
- Is Hugo still single?
- Sadder.

05:53.024 --> 05:54.313
Oh, um, uh...

05:54.390 --> 05:55.776
Is Hugo still single?

05:55.853 --> 05:57.055
I hope so.

05:57.132 --> 05:58.889
Too much.
Split the difference.

05:59.239 --> 06:01.371
Uh, so, how'd the auction go?

06:01.448 --> 06:05.501
Not good. BaconltToTheLimit31
beat me at the very last second.

06:05.578 --> 06:07.323
Turns out he really does bacon
it. Right up to the limit.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.442
He really does.

06:09.519 --> 06:12.245
The bad news is I didn't find
anything downstairs.

06:12.356 --> 06:15.401
The good news is that I did find

06:15.478 --> 06:17.960
- something upstairs.
- Where?

06:18.037 --> 06:19.549
You need to, um...

06:19.626 --> 06:22.550
update and sign your safe
food-handling license.

06:22.627 --> 06:24.073
W-Wait, what?
I-I don't even think

06:24.150 --> 06:25.441
this one's expired,
by the way.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.373
Uh, yup.
This thing's super expired.

06:27.450 --> 06:29.127
Might as well tear it up.

06:29.804 --> 06:30.908
This is ridiculous.

06:30.985 --> 06:32.308
It is ridiculous.

06:32.385 --> 06:34.270
You're attempting
to operate a restaurant

06:34.347 --> 06:35.782
with a torn-up
food-handling license.

06:35.859 --> 06:38.652
That's why you need to come down
to the Health Department office

06:38.729 --> 06:40.338
and sign for a new license.

06:40.415 --> 06:43.987
In person. Right now.
Or I shut you down.

06:44.064 --> 06:45.190
You can't be serious.

06:45.267 --> 06:46.762
Bob, maybe you should just go.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.531
Take as much time as you need.

06:48.746 --> 06:50.978
All right, fine.
I'll drive down there,

06:51.055 --> 06:52.441
but this better be quick.

06:52.518 --> 06:55.200
Uh, you? Drive?
No, no, no, no, no.

06:55.277 --> 06:57.533
They would never let you in
without a certified vehicle.

06:57.610 --> 07:00.232
W-Wait, what do you mean,
"a certified vehicle"?

07:00.309 --> 07:01.815
Get in the van, Bob.

07:01.892 --> 07:04.443
Or, as I like to call it,
Health on Wheels.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.374
Oh, my God.

07:08.203 --> 07:10.856
Okay, we only have a few hours
to plan this party

07:10.933 --> 07:13.105
and hide the fact that we all
forgot your father's birthday.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.767
And if we pull this off,
we shall never

07:15.844 --> 07:17.586
speak of this
in our family again.

07:17.663 --> 07:18.911
Like that time I caught Dad

07:18.988 --> 07:20.426
flexing his legs in the mirror.

07:20.503 --> 07:23.144
We can do this.
I mean, I love to plan parties.

07:23.221 --> 07:24.158
That's my thing.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.876
That and talking during movies.

07:25.953 --> 07:28.276
All right, we need, uh,
decorations and gifts

07:28.353 --> 07:29.816
and guests and refreshments.

07:29.893 --> 07:31.244
I can be in charge
of decorations.

07:31.321 --> 07:32.437
- Great.
- Yes!

07:32.514 --> 07:34.864
Gene, Louise, what do you want
to be in charge of?

07:34.941 --> 07:36.557
Uh, I can't help
until my hair is

07:36.634 --> 07:38.591
slightly more back
to full hotness.

07:38.668 --> 07:40.429
All right, how about
I give you ten dollars

07:40.506 --> 07:42.251
and you go ask Gretchen
if she can fix it?

07:42.328 --> 07:44.720
Or... better idea...
I'll help Gene with his hair.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.252
And I'll do it for a discounted
rate of only eight dollars.

07:47.329 --> 07:49.455
But I don't have any change,
so I'll just take this.

07:49.532 --> 07:50.994
Okay, okay, just do it quick.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.388
I'm gonna start making calls.

07:52.465 --> 07:53.954
Everybody, hands in the middle.

07:54.031 --> 07:55.682
Let's throw a party
to cover up the fact

07:55.759 --> 07:57.218
we forgot Dad's birthday!

07:57.295 --> 07:59.598
Let's throw a party
to cover up the fact

07:59.675 --> 08:02.244
we forgot Dad's birthday.

08:02.855 --> 08:04.691
- Is that sound
coming from the van?

08:04.768 --> 08:06.850
I've been telling Hugo
to get it checked for months.

08:06.927 --> 08:09.939
It's fine. It's probably just
a rusty... wheel... plug.

08:10.016 --> 08:12.353
- A rusty wheel plug?
- That's not a thing.

08:12.430 --> 08:14.606
Oh, are you both
van experts now?

08:14.683 --> 08:15.957
You know what?
I don't really care.

08:16.034 --> 08:18.103
I just want to get this
over with as soon as possible

08:18.180 --> 08:19.156
and get back to work.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.778
And what do you think
wedo, Bob?

08:20.855 --> 08:22.790
You don't think we work,
too, Bob?

08:22.867 --> 08:24.125
I know you work, Hugo.

08:24.202 --> 08:26.169
I'm sure it's exhausting
harassing people

08:26.246 --> 08:27.637
and trying to shut down
literally

08:27.714 --> 08:29.277
every restaurant in town.

08:29.354 --> 08:32.631
- Ow!
- Harassing people? Wow.

08:32.708 --> 08:35.299
Bob, health inspectors
are the thin green line

08:35.376 --> 08:36.919
between the diners of this town

08:36.996 --> 08:39.100
and gastrointestinal
catastrophe.

08:39.177 --> 08:40.169
- Preach.
- You know what?

08:40.246 --> 08:41.544
I'd like to show you something.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.777
Is it something that will

08:42.854 --> 08:44.527
- make this day take longer?
- Yes.

08:44.604 --> 08:46.338
You're coming with us
on an inspection.

08:46.415 --> 08:47.792
No, no, no, no. No.

08:47.869 --> 08:49.529
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

08:49.753 --> 08:51.881
Welcome to your
worst nightmare, Bob.

08:51.958 --> 08:54.128
Except worse,
because of all the violations.

08:54.205 --> 08:56.165
Hugo, has this place
even opened yet?

08:56.242 --> 08:57.808
It opens next week.
What's your point?

08:57.885 --> 08:59.937
How bad can it be?
It looks like a nice place.

09:00.014 --> 09:02.749
It's probably just a nice person
serving nice food.

09:02.826 --> 09:04.492
Oh, is it nice food, Bob?

09:04.569 --> 09:07.245
Is it a nice person
serving nice food, Bob?

09:07.322 --> 09:09.128
I don't know how you
get through the day, Ron.

09:09.205 --> 09:10.753
- What?
- Why don't you put your mouth

09:10.830 --> 09:12.300
where your mouth is?

09:12.377 --> 09:14.975
No matter what happens in there,
no matter what you see,

09:15.052 --> 09:16.734
no matter what you smell,

09:16.923 --> 09:20.345
you will eat a wrap
at the end of this inspection.

09:20.422 --> 09:23.915
Yeah, I'll eat a wrap.
I'll eat the crap out of a wrap.

09:24.009 --> 09:25.768
Okay. After you.

09:25.845 --> 09:28.028
Wait, no, you go after me.
Ron, get the door.

09:28.105 --> 09:30.419
Ooh, wow.
Real-life health inspectors

09:30.496 --> 09:31.846
in my restaurant?

09:31.923 --> 09:33.210
Now this is getting real.

09:33.287 --> 09:35.458
Now, this is getting veryreal.

09:35.704 --> 09:37.225
I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name?

09:37.302 --> 09:38.390
Don't worry about him.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.680
He's just a guy named Bob.
Bob Dork.

09:40.757 --> 09:42.701
- That's not my name.
- He's not a health inspector.

09:42.778 --> 09:44.502
- Thank God.
- He just wishes he was.

09:44.579 --> 09:46.023
- And he doesn't talk.
- Mm.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.730
We're still in the middle
of our "medium soft practice

09:48.807 --> 09:50.876
kinda-sorta not really
opening" opening.

09:50.953 --> 09:52.664
Hey, where do you guys
think this plant should go?

09:52.741 --> 09:54.045
- Here? Here?
- Mm.

09:54.122 --> 09:56.202
- Mm. Mm. Mm.
- Here? Here?

09:56.279 --> 09:57.740
- You don't sound happy. Here?
- Mm.

09:57.817 --> 09:59.195
- Here?
- Uh, yeah. There.

09:59.272 --> 10:00.972
- Really? Wow.
- O-Or maybe there.

10:01.049 --> 10:03.589
Are you kidding me?
We don't care about the plant!

10:03.666 --> 10:04.981
Take us to the kitchen.

10:05.058 --> 10:07.169
Uh, this chicken
needs to be stored

10:07.246 --> 10:08.728
at 40 degrees or less.

10:08.805 --> 10:11.539
Oh, fun chicken fact.
How do you even know that?

10:11.616 --> 10:12.675
Oh, God.

10:12.771 --> 10:14.582
Hold on.
When was the last time

10:14.659 --> 10:16.211
you washedthis rag?

10:16.288 --> 10:18.823
I'm sorry... washed?
Are you saying washedthe rag?

10:18.900 --> 10:19.708
Oh, God.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.449
There are rodent droppings

10:21.526 --> 10:22.959
near your salad prep area!

10:23.036 --> 10:24.191
Oh, that'swhat those are.

10:24.268 --> 10:25.328
Okay, you can just
flick them away.

10:25.405 --> 10:26.336
Oh, God.

10:26.413 --> 10:28.016
So, what do you say, Mort?

10:28.098 --> 10:30.529
You gonna come over to celebrate
your favorite burger man?

10:30.606 --> 10:31.948
Gosh, Linda, I wish I could,

10:32.025 --> 10:33.270
but I have a funeral tonight.

10:33.347 --> 10:34.902
Can't be in two places at once.

10:34.979 --> 10:37.191
Which, by the way,
is how this guy died.

10:37.453 --> 10:39.820
So, what do you say, Reggie...
You think you can make it?

10:39.897 --> 10:41.523
Aw, geez, Linda, I would,
but they

10:41.600 --> 10:43.160
have to check me out
of Intensive Care.

10:43.237 --> 10:45.380
Just a little heart attack,
nothing to worry about.

10:45.457 --> 10:47.005
Oh-oh, my God, Reggie,
I'm so sorry,

10:47.082 --> 10:49.130
but I got to call you back
tomorrow. Okay, bye.

10:49.325 --> 10:52.731
Delightful. I will absolutely
be there. Count me in.

10:52.811 --> 10:55.353
Oh, really, Mr. Fischoeder?
That's great.

10:55.430 --> 10:56.511
Wait, who-who is this?

10:56.588 --> 10:58.176
It-It's Linda. Lin...

10:58.253 --> 10:59.688
From Linda and Bob?

10:59.765 --> 11:02.224
Oh, I can't make it.

11:02.304 --> 11:04.481
I, um, a dog is, uh,

11:04.558 --> 11:06.625
biting my, uh, leg.

11:06.702 --> 11:08.801
You can bring the dog,
if you come.

11:08.878 --> 11:10.090
Mm, he doesn't want to go.

11:10.167 --> 11:12.195
- So, how did I do?
- Not good.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.528
- So... not too shabby?
- No!

11:13.605 --> 11:14.981
You did bad.

11:15.058 --> 11:17.097
I don't understand.
I-I did everything right.

11:17.174 --> 11:18.767
You did almost nothing right.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.057
Okay, so what does
this mean for the restaurant?

11:21.134 --> 11:23.843
It means the last wrap
you're making today

11:23.920 --> 11:26.500
- is for Bob.
- Oh. Okay.

11:26.577 --> 11:29.221
And while you do that, I'm going
to read off your violations.

11:29.298 --> 11:31.616
Dirty utensils.
Illegal use of the finger.

11:31.693 --> 11:33.226
Strange, booger-looking
viscous material

11:33.303 --> 11:34.354
on your cutting board.

11:34.431 --> 11:36.136
Keep chewing.
We had a deal.

11:36.213 --> 11:37.639
Excessively thick milk.

11:37.716 --> 11:41.618
Moldy mango. Fuzzy tortillas.

11:42.593 --> 11:45.081
Mom, I know you're busy,
but look whose hair

11:45.158 --> 11:46.383
is perfectly normal.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.452
Does he have magic marker
on his forehead?

11:49.529 --> 11:51.104
I'm really surprised
you noticed,

11:51.181 --> 11:53.481
but I don't think anyone else
is going to be able to tell.

11:53.558 --> 11:55.048
I like the smell, but I'm dizzy.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.541
Enough hair talk.
I've got a party to plan here.

11:57.618 --> 12:00.456
Reggie was a no. Mort was a no.
Teddy's out of town.

12:00.533 --> 12:02.626
Mike the Mailman said he left
something in his truck

12:02.703 --> 12:03.774
and then he never came back.

12:03.851 --> 12:05.120
At least we have decorations.

12:05.197 --> 12:06.538
I mean, I'm pulling my weight.

12:06.615 --> 12:09.041
- Tina, the party's upstairs.
- What?

12:09.118 --> 12:11.520
Yeah. -Son of a bitch! Why
didn't somebody stop me?

12:11.597 --> 12:13.152
Just kidding, I'm just kidding.

12:13.229 --> 12:14.516
You're nailing it.
You're nailing it.

12:14.593 --> 12:16.114
I mean, you're not.
You're taping it, but...

12:16.191 --> 12:17.602
Yeah, I found this tape
in the bathroom.

12:17.679 --> 12:19.659
It had a lot of floss on it,
but it still works.

12:19.736 --> 12:21.732
You guys having a "going out
of business" prom, or...

12:21.809 --> 12:22.353
Come on.

12:22.430 --> 12:24.425
Oh, go put a cannoli
up your holey.

12:24.502 --> 12:25.694
Oh...

12:26.020 --> 12:27.220
Hair.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.209
We're planning
a surprise party for my dad

12:29.286 --> 12:30.112
and you're not invited.

12:30.189 --> 12:31.867
Oh, yeah? Well, how many
people are coming?

12:31.944 --> 12:34.372
Uh... we got a... few.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.031
I mean, tons.
Tons of people.

12:36.108 --> 12:37.693
Whoa...

12:38.503 --> 12:39.985
Everyone said no, huh?

12:40.062 --> 12:41.921
- Oh, you shush.
- Oh, no!

12:41.998 --> 12:44.405
- Tina, what happened?
- Damn floss tape!

12:44.482 --> 12:46.876
This is the saddest
surprise party ever.

12:46.953 --> 12:48.469
- When is it?
- 7:00.

12:48.546 --> 12:50.107
I'm coming back.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.985
Oh, I cannot wait
to see the look

12:52.062 --> 12:54.107
on Bob's dumb face
when he cries.

12:54.184 --> 12:57.432
Uh, at least we have
Jimmy Pesto. That's one.

12:59.939 --> 13:02.808
You, sir, are hereby prohibited
from serving food

13:02.885 --> 13:05.125
until all violations
have been corrected.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.206
- You get an F.
- Out of...?

13:07.318 --> 13:09.567
Here's the sign. You're supposed
to put it in the window.

13:09.644 --> 13:11.926
- 'Kay, but what if people see it?
- That's the point!

13:12.003 --> 13:14.526
- Ron, Bob, get in the van.
- Oh, God.

13:14.603 --> 13:16.129
At least we'll be moving,
I guess.

13:16.206 --> 13:18.531
And this will be over soon.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.369
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:21.446 --> 13:23.754
Is smoke supposed to be coming
out of the front or the back?

13:23.831 --> 13:24.974
Because it's coming out of both.

13:25.173 --> 13:26.875
- And the sides.
- Damn it!

13:26.952 --> 13:29.272
Okay, new plan. All the
customers that are here now...

13:29.349 --> 13:31.204
Let's just keep 'em here
until 7:00.

13:31.281 --> 13:33.236
We'll, uh, pretend
they're your dad's friends.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.331
He'll never catch on.

13:34.408 --> 13:36.768
It'll be an extra surprise
party. It's not even

13:36.845 --> 13:38.862
people your father knows.
It's total strangers.

13:38.939 --> 13:40.221
That's a good idea, right?

13:40.298 --> 13:42.217
Uh, Mom?
Are you feeling okay?

13:42.294 --> 13:44.411
- Your eye is twitching.
- I'm f-I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:44.534 --> 13:46.782
Miss? I'll-I'll take a check
when you get a chance.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.683
- Oh, God.
- Stall, Mom, stall.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.624
- Don't give it to her.
- Uh... No.

13:51.701 --> 13:53.324
- What?
- Nice one, bro.

13:53.401 --> 13:55.037
I mean, um, I got to go
into the kitchen.

13:55.114 --> 13:57.300
- Uh, I won't be back
until, uh... 7-00.

13:57.377 --> 13:59.667
I know what a dipstick is, Ron.

13:59.744 --> 14:02.156
When you're called something
enough times, you look it up.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.983
Wow, I'm really surprised
I did so bad.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.677
- I've never done bad at-at anything.
- Really?

14:06.754 --> 14:08.029
Ugh, sorry.

14:08.106 --> 14:11.184
I mean, in the finance world,
I just kept making money.

14:11.261 --> 14:13.747
- Too much money, you know what I mean?
- Uh, yeah.

14:13.834 --> 14:16.487
I mean, no, I don't
really know what you mean.

14:16.624 --> 14:18.680
When I said I was gonna open
this place, people were like,

14:18.757 --> 14:20.280
"You should go to school
and get training."

14:20.357 --> 14:22.498
And I was like,
"I just want to open it.

14:22.575 --> 14:25.227
I've got the killer name.
The rest'll work itself out."

14:25.304 --> 14:27.533
Oh, Bob Dork, are you okay?

14:27.666 --> 14:29.463
Do you always sweat this much?

14:29.540 --> 14:31.569
Am-am I sweating?
Yeah. I am.

14:31.646 --> 14:33.169
Hmm. You think
it's something you ate?

14:33.246 --> 14:35.158
- I do. I really do.
- Hey, guys,

14:35.235 --> 14:37.707
I think Bob Dork's
not feeling very well.

14:39.036 --> 14:40.124
Are you gonna throw up?

14:40.201 --> 14:41.224
Yeah. A lot.

14:41.301 --> 14:42.947
Geez, you're right in front
of my restaurant.

14:43.024 --> 14:45.336
I feel like, you know,
you puking plus the "F" rating,

14:45.413 --> 14:46.873
it-it might not so look good.

14:48.963 --> 14:50.152
He's fine.

14:50.229 --> 14:52.878
Ev-Everything's fine.
Yeah, we open next week.

14:52.955 --> 14:54.551
Come by, lunch and dinner.

14:54.628 --> 14:57.550
Okay, uh, th-there you go,
big fella.

15:00.844 --> 15:03.383
Okay, I-I know some of you
don't know Bob that well,

15:03.460 --> 15:05.938
but all you got to do is stick
around till he shows up,

15:06.015 --> 15:08.462
you say, "Surprise," and I'll
give you all free ice cream.

15:08.539 --> 15:10.906
- That's pretty sad.
- Yes, it is.

15:10.983 --> 15:12.907
This is gonna be hilarious.

15:12.984 --> 15:15.120
Guy probably doesn't even
like surprise parties.

15:15.197 --> 15:17.576
What do you mean? Everybody
likes surprise parties.

15:17.653 --> 15:18.702
That's a known fact.

15:18.779 --> 15:20.812
Uh, yeah, Linda.
Everybody loves

15:20.889 --> 15:22.533
coming back
to their peaceful abode

15:22.610 --> 15:25.127
and having a bunch of people
jump out and scream at 'em.

15:25.204 --> 15:27.060
Or "Surprise" or whatever.

15:27.331 --> 15:28.986
Huh. That is true, Mom.

15:29.063 --> 15:30.742
Dad doesn't like parties
very much.

15:30.819 --> 15:33.581
- Or surprises.
- Or us. Well, you guys.

15:33.658 --> 15:36.106
Oh, my God.
I guess that's true.

15:36.183 --> 15:37.739
Just because I like
throwing parties

15:37.816 --> 15:39.946
doesn't mean he likes
having 'em thrown for him.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.992
I was so caught up
in all the party planning,

15:42.069 --> 15:43.592
I missed what was
right in front of me.

15:43.669 --> 15:44.930
Your boobs?

15:45.343 --> 15:46.933
I know what we need to do.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.381
Is it something with your boobs?

15:48.458 --> 15:50.959
No. Get off the boobs, guys.
We're moving on.

15:51.036 --> 15:52.246
Never!

15:54.505 --> 15:56.608
Well, Bob, is there anything
you want to say

15:56.685 --> 15:58.214
about health inspectors?

15:59.128 --> 16:01.572
Okay, Hugo.
You were right. I admit it.

16:02.743 --> 16:04.870
Y-You have a very important job.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.969
You keep people safe
from restaurants like Sam's.

16:09.046 --> 16:10.967
It's nice to be
appreciated, Bob.

16:11.044 --> 16:12.691
And I can smell
how much you mean it.

16:12.768 --> 16:14.571
You know, in finance,
there's no inspectors.

16:14.648 --> 16:15.724
You just don't need 'em.

16:15.801 --> 16:18.148
You know, Hugo, we need
to get Bob back by 7:00.

16:18.225 --> 16:21.009
If... a certain... phone call
is going to happen?

16:21.086 --> 16:22.794
You know what?
I don't care, Ron.

16:22.871 --> 16:25.999
Watching Bob vomit and say
how cool health inspectors are

16:26.076 --> 16:28.382
is way better than that
phone call ever would've been.

16:28.791 --> 16:30.113
What are you guys
talking about?

16:30.190 --> 16:32.003
Let's just stick him in a cab
and call a tow.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.255
I might have an alcoholic drink
tonight, an alcoholic wine.

16:35.332 --> 16:37.553
Wait, don't I have to
go to your office to...

16:37.782 --> 16:39.664
sign a form?

16:40.520 --> 16:41.626
"Sign a form."

16:41.747 --> 16:43.144
That's you, Bob.

16:43.343 --> 16:45.155
Forget about the license.
We'll do it later.

16:45.232 --> 16:46.762
Consider it a birthday present.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.294
Oh, is it your birthday,
Bob Dork?

16:48.371 --> 16:50.306
Wait, h-how did you know
it was my birthday?

16:50.469 --> 16:52.561
Uh... Ron told me.

16:52.767 --> 16:55.924
Uh... yeah, I know
everyone's birthday.

16:56.001 --> 16:57.400
It's a blessing and a curse.

16:57.477 --> 17:00.294
Oh, God. Did Linda ask you
to get me out of the restaurant

17:00.371 --> 17:02.899
so she could set something up?
Is this all made up?

17:02.976 --> 17:04.586
Uh... Ah, fine. Yes.

17:04.663 --> 17:06.940
Wait, was my health inspection
made up, too?

17:07.017 --> 17:08.940
No, your restaurant's
disgusting.

17:09.017 --> 17:11.361
- Mm. Fair enough.
- Oh, I really don't want to go

17:11.438 --> 17:14.086
- to a surprise birthday party.
- You don't? Why not?

17:14.163 --> 17:17.304
I don't like surprise parties
or non-surprise parties.

17:17.381 --> 17:20.652
Oh, do you think your birthday
is about you, Bob?

17:20.729 --> 17:21.849
- Huh?
- It's not.

17:21.926 --> 17:23.333
It's about the people
who care about you

17:23.410 --> 17:24.987
showing that they
care about you.

17:25.064 --> 17:28.310
And you don't complain about it,
you appreciate it!

17:28.387 --> 17:31.348
Unless you're a baby.
Are you a baby, Bob?

17:31.425 --> 17:34.439
No. -Well, you are throwing up a lot.
Like a baby.

17:34.516 --> 17:37.286
Do you know what I would give
for someone... anyone...

17:37.363 --> 17:39.890
To celebrate me?
I have no one.

17:39.967 --> 17:42.218
- No one!
- Well, you have one person.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.900
- No one!
- You have... Oh.

17:43.977 --> 17:46.022
Oh, God.
Hugo, I-I can't believe

17:46.099 --> 17:48.447
I'm about to say this, but...

17:48.535 --> 17:51.783
I... I think you
might be right. Again.

17:51.860 --> 17:53.314
You do? -Yeah. I shouldn't

17:53.391 --> 17:55.002
complain about
a surprise party

17:55.079 --> 17:56.825
if it makes Linda happy
to throw one.

17:56.902 --> 17:58.095
Go to her, Bob.

17:58.172 --> 17:59.800
- I need a ride.
- I can give you a ride.

17:59.877 --> 18:01.923
I've got a convertible, so you
can just puke over the side

18:02.000 --> 18:04.352
- if you need to.
- I will need to, Sam.

18:04.429 --> 18:07.237
I will need to.
Oh, and Hugo?

18:07.426 --> 18:09.238
- Um, thanks.
- I hate you.

18:09.315 --> 18:11.467
- What's that?
- Nothing. Uh, happy birthday.

18:11.544 --> 18:12.789
I hate you.

18:13.650 --> 18:15.181
Uh, thanks for the ride, Sam.

18:15.258 --> 18:17.489
Uh, listen, don't take this
the wrong way, but, um,

18:17.631 --> 18:20.057
chef to chef, you should
get some training.

18:20.134 --> 18:21.913
Um, maybe a lot of training.

18:22.048 --> 18:25.090
Or maybe I'll just switch
to something easier, like sushi.

18:25.167 --> 18:26.654
That's fish, right?

18:28.090 --> 18:30.118
- Hey, Gene.
- Aah! He's here. He's here.

18:30.195 --> 18:31.599
And he definitely didn't see me.

18:31.676 --> 18:33.672
Okay, act surprised.
Just...

18:33.749 --> 18:35.899
just act surprised and smile.

18:36.468 --> 18:38.126
That's not a smile.

18:38.608 --> 18:41.230
That's a smile. I think.

18:42.499 --> 18:43.935
Hello?

18:45.390 --> 18:48.100
Hello?
Hello?

18:49.612 --> 18:51.363
Hi, Bobby.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.247
Hi.
Is anyone else here?

18:54.324 --> 18:56.484
- Just us. -Hello, Father.
- Hi, Dad.

18:56.561 --> 19:00.111
Hi, kids. Gene, I like it.
I like what you're doing there.

19:00.188 --> 19:02.156
Thank you.
I'm turning lemons into

19:02.233 --> 19:03.837
"lemme tell you about my hair."

19:03.914 --> 19:06.022
So there's not
a room full of people

19:06.099 --> 19:07.783
waiting to jump out
and yell, "Surprise"?

19:07.860 --> 19:09.445
Bob, listen.
The truth is

19:09.522 --> 19:11.612
we all forgot about
your birthday yesterday,

19:11.689 --> 19:14.554
and... Wait, how'd you know we
were planning a surprise party?

19:14.631 --> 19:16.236
Hugo and Ron spilled the beans.

19:16.313 --> 19:17.723
I'm sorry, Bob.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.685
I felt awful about
forgetting your birthday,

19:19.762 --> 19:21.592
and I really wanted
to make it up to you.

19:21.669 --> 19:24.700
- It's okay, honestly.
- Well, it's not okay to me.

19:24.777 --> 19:26.563
At first we wanted
to throw you a party,

19:26.640 --> 19:29.147
but then we realized that's
probably not what youwanted,

19:29.224 --> 19:30.188
so we canceled it.

19:30.265 --> 19:32.734
Dad, you should've seen
how many people showed up.

19:32.811 --> 19:34.275
And the streamers
looked amazing.

19:34.352 --> 19:36.471
So, we got you what we think
you really wanted.

19:36.548 --> 19:40.232
Bobby, I present to you
your belated birthday present.

19:40.435 --> 19:42.108
The... couch?

19:42.185 --> 19:43.842
Yes, but not just the couch.

19:43.919 --> 19:47.184
Also, we put one of your Western
flicks in the DVD player,

19:47.261 --> 19:49.830
and we made you a freshly
grilled steak. Look.

19:49.907 --> 19:52.196
And I promise it always
had those bites taken out of it.

19:52.273 --> 19:54.100
And we warmed up your sweatpants
in the dryer,

19:54.177 --> 19:56.287
- the way you like them. -Hot pants.
- Toasted buns.

19:56.364 --> 20:00.151
It's... perfect.
It's absolutely perfect.

20:00.246 --> 20:01.253
Really?

20:01.330 --> 20:03.570
Yeah. I mean, I was ready
for a big party.

20:03.647 --> 20:06.856
I-I really was, because I know
you like to throw those,

20:06.933 --> 20:08.386
and that's totally fine.

20:08.463 --> 20:10.961
Okay. Sounds like
it's not fine, but go on.

20:11.038 --> 20:12.399
This is so much better.

20:12.510 --> 20:15.430
Oh, oh, I almost forgot.
Uh, here, for you.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.134
- Here you go.
- Oh, my God!

20:17.211 --> 20:19.285
It's the bacon weight.
H-How did you get this?

20:19.362 --> 20:22.132
I drove over to the antique shop
in Bog Harbor.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.526
Oh, it feels nice.
Really nice.

20:24.603 --> 20:26.256
- Get a room.
- I will.

20:26.356 --> 20:29.341
Having a real rager
for your birthday, huh, Bob?

20:30.159 --> 20:31.369
Oh!
Keep it down up there

20:31.446 --> 20:33.381
or I'm calling the cops.

20:33.986 --> 20:37.155
- Ha, ha. You're dumb.
- No, Jimmy, you're...

20:37.232 --> 20:38.673
On your left, ma'am.

20:39.039 --> 20:40.183
Oh, God.

20:40.586 --> 20:42.544
Oh, my God.

20:43.203 --> 20:45.069
Oh, that's...

20:45.728 --> 20:48.698
Can't stop watching.
Jimmy, you all right?

20:48.775 --> 20:49.748
I'm all right.

20:49.825 --> 20:51.676
He'll probably
be fine. Let's start the movie.

20:51.753 --> 20:54.640
Stupid bike.
Drive a car, you cave man!

20:54.919 --> 20:56.866
This really is
the best birthday ever.

20:56.943 --> 20:57.924
Aah!

20:58.001 --> 21:00.170
âª Happy birthday âª

21:00.247 --> 21:02.532
âª Happy birthday âª

21:03.112 --> 21:05.391
âª We forgot about
your birthday âª

21:05.646 --> 21:07.526
âª And then you threw up âª

21:07.603 --> 21:09.589
âª Oh, no âª

21:17.182 --> 21:19.139
âª Happy birthday, Bob âª

21:19.216 --> 21:20.986
âª We forgot it then you threw
up, we forgot it âª

21:21.063 --> 21:23.223
âª Then you threw up
, we forgot it then you threw up âª

21:23.300 --> 21:25.424
âª We forgot it then
you threw up, we forgot it âª

21:25.501 --> 21:26.857
âª Then you threw up âª

21:26.950 --> 21:28.764
Sorry.
