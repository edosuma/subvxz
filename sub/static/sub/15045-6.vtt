this really horrible tragedy

that happened in Point Pleasant
in the '60s.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.834
It was the collapse

03:18.232 --> 03:19.598
<i>¶ ¶</i>

03:19.633 --> 03:21.400
<i>- The, uh, store owner told us</i>

03:21.435 --> 03:24.670
that roughly a year
before the bridge collapsed,

03:24.705 --> 03:27.706
there had been
this winged entity

in Point Pleasant.

03:30.144 --> 03:33.178
Everybody was seeing this thing.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.846
- It made the headlines.

03:34.882 --> 03:39.151
This journalist here
gave it a name.

03:39.186 --> 03:42.521
He called it the Mothman.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.724
<i>¶ ¶</i>

03:45.759 --> 03:47.426
<i>- A lot of people,</i>
<i>when they saw the Mothman,</i>

03:47.461 --> 03:49.761
felt this instant
fear and dread,

03:49.797 --> 03:52.364
like something awful
was about to happen.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.200
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

<i>or an angel of death.</i>

<i>¶ ¶</i>

04:04.778 --> 04:06.478
- What are these?

04:06.513 --> 04:08.146
- Well, those are bunkers.

04:08.182 --> 04:11.783
They used to store munitions
there during World War II.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.819
- There's pictures
of these concrete igloos

04:13.854 --> 04:16.421
<i>covered with grass and shrubs.</i>

04:16.457 --> 04:19.958
- That's where The Mothman
was first seen in the '60s.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.593
It was his domain.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.495
- Can you get
to the bunkers now?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.197
- Oh, sure,
it's a nature reserve.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.965
You should go see it.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.133
- Shall we?

04:28.168 --> 04:29.935
- So, uh, he drew us,
you know, a little map.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.136
Told us how to get there.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.038
<i>[eerie music]</i>

04:33.073 --> 04:34.539
- There you go.
Really simple.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.376
- We decided to just hop
in the car and go check it out.

04:39.013 --> 04:41.513
- Oh, hey, guys.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.949
If you really wanna
creep yourself out...

04:43.984 --> 04:45.117
<i>- As we were leaving,</i>
<i>the guy told us</i>

04:45.152 --> 04:46.952
to, uh, try some recordings
in the bunker.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.320
- Recordings?

04:48.355 --> 04:51.590
- People have recorded
some strange noises.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.227
- People sometimes capture these
disembodied voices on tape.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.095
- Especially
when you ask questions.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.463
- Really?

04:58.499 --> 04:59.965
- It wasn't really something
we were interested in.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.300
We--we pretty much
discounted it.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.136
Just, you know, part of
the whole folklore of the area.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.937
- Thanks anyway.
Bye.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.106
<i>- So, I mean, it was</i>
<i>in the back of our minds,</i>

05:08.142 --> 05:10.609

<i>to go ahead and take off.</i>

05:10.644 --> 05:13.211

05:38.539 --> 05:39.971
<i>It was almost like</i>
<i>you were expecting something</i>

- No.

we got to
this little clearing...

06:33.794 --> 06:38.096
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:38.132 --> 06:41.266
- All you could see was just
this huge steel door

<i>it was just</i>
<i>a complete transition.</i>

07:23.677 --> 07:27.512

[cell phone beeps]

07:40.427 --> 07:42.194
And then I remembered

07:42.229 --> 07:43.728
what the guy at the store
had told me

07:43.764 --> 07:46.031
about the recordings,
so I thought, you know,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.833
"Hey, what could it hurt."
[cell phone beeps]

07:47.868 --> 07:49.801
<i>I went ahead and hit record,</i>

07:49.837 --> 07:52.537

<i>a couple of questions.</i>

07:52.573 --> 07:54.940
- Is anyone there?

Is anyone listening?

I suddenly began just getting
this very strange feeling.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.166
- Hello?

08:21.201 --> 08:22.601
- Jeff.

08:22.636 --> 08:26.037
- Can you hear me?

08:26.073 --> 08:29.040
We're waiting.
- Jeff, this is enough.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.175

[wings flutter]

08:36.383 --> 08:39.284

08:39.319 --> 08:40.819
- Jeff, I don't like it here.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.354
- So, I said, "Come on, Jeff..."

08:42.389 --> 08:45.657

this feeling,

uh, down to it being
a strange environment.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.741

listen to the recordings

We were four hours away

26:27.653 --> 26:30.220
I knew that it was
the cabinet opening.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.556

26:55.781 --> 26:57.014
<i>There was just no way</i>

26:57.049 --> 26:59.917
that the glass could have
fell off on its own.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.453
<i>- It was like something was</i>

27:17.136 --> 27:20.437

27:20.472 --> 27:22.039
I thought,
"Hey, maybe this is over now.

27:22.074 --> 27:25.175
Maybe whatever is happening
is done."

27:25.211 --> 27:26.343
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:26.378 --> 27:27.878

27:27.913 --> 27:29.680
if we had worked ourselves up.

27:29.715 --> 27:33.283
You know,
the power of suggestion.

27:33.319 --> 27:37.254
Maybe the shelf had come loose
and the glass just busted.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.356
<i>Maybe the guy by the road</i>
<i>was a hitchhiker.</i>

27:39.391 --> 27:42.659
Maybe what I'd seen
in the bedroom was just

27:42.695 --> 27:44.995

I have no idea how one gets

[clattering]

whatever is continuing
to plague us

29:48.253 --> 29:50.620
started in Point Pleasant.

29:50.655 --> 29:53.056
- We didn't even want
to admit to each other

29:53.091 --> 29:55.258
that it could be Mothman
'cause it just sounded silly.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.694
<i>I mean, Mothman,</i>

29:57.729 --> 30:00.630

30:06.604 --> 30:07.737
<i>- We had to do something</i>

30:07.772 --> 30:11.708
<i>before it escalated</i>
<i>even further.</i>

30:11.743 --> 30:13.910
We researched
as much as we could online,

30:13.945 --> 30:16.913
we--we--we read as many books
as we could find.

30:16.948 --> 30:19.849

When we'd read about

30:24.389 --> 30:26.222
we--we were blown away at how--

30:26.257 --> 30:28.825
<i>at how remarkably similar</i>

30:28.860 --> 30:31.828

30:33.665 --> 30:34.998
<i>[high-pitch shriek]</i>

30:35.033 --> 30:37.300
We weren't by ourselves.
This--this had happened before.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.769
People had made it through
these types of situations,

30:39.804 --> 30:41.204
so there was still hope for us.

30:41.239 --> 30:43.272
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:43.308 --> 30:45.108
<i>We started to connect the dots.</i>

30:45.143 --> 30:46.876
Could something have
followed us home

30:46.911 --> 30:48.177
<i>from the TNT Area?</i>

30:48.213 --> 30:51.114
<i>Could that be</i>
<i>where this nightmare began?</i>

31:01.426 --> 31:03.526
Faye Dewitt,
it says that she was attacked

31:06.231 --> 31:10.533
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:10.568 --> 31:13.302
She reported it to the police.

<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:16.841 --> 31:19.442
<i>- This thing was tangible.</i>

31:19.477 --> 31:22.512
I couldn't believe
what I was really seeing.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.514
<i>I just know it was real.</i>

31:24.549 --> 31:26.015
- All of a sudden,
this thing was running

31:26.051 --> 31:27.417
right beside the car.

31:27.452 --> 31:29.285
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

31:29.320 --> 31:32.155
I was hitting my brother's leg
telling him to hurry.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.057
"Hurry up.
Get us out of here."

31:34.092 --> 31:36.159
- It just followed
right along with us

31:36.194 --> 31:38.761
like it was
no problem whatsoever.

31:38.797 --> 31:42.432
- So my brother did a hard turn
into the TNT loading dock.

31:42.467 --> 31:45.268
We were trapped
so he slammed on his brakes.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.036
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:47.072 --> 31:48.538
- And in the blink of an eye,

31:48.573 --> 31:51.340
that thing jumped
right on the hood of our car.

31:51.376 --> 31:53.576
- We were sitting there frozen.

31:53.611 --> 31:56.045
We were afraid
if we made the least move...

31:56.081 --> 31:59.382
- That it'll come through
the windshield or something.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.919
- How do you know
it wasn't just a man?

32:02.954 --> 32:04.454
- Because it had wings.

32:04.489 --> 32:11.094
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:11.129 --> 32:14.430
- It jumped off the car,

32:15.733 --> 32:18.301

32:21.873 --> 32:23.606
It just flew into the dark.

- You're sure about this,
are you?

32:25.510 --> 32:26.843
- I know what I saw.

32:26.878 --> 32:30.513
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:30.548 --> 32:33.716
- We knew then that we needed
to go back to Point Pleasant.

32:33.751 --> 32:36.219
<i>Back to the bunker</i>
<i>where we captured the voice.</i>

32:36.254 --> 32:38.588
We just wanted to go
and confront it to tell it,

32:38.623 --> 32:41.390
<i>"You need to stop.</i>
<i>You need to leave us alone.'</i>

32:44.529 --> 32:47.430
- We needed to communicate
with whatever this is

32:47.465 --> 32:49.565
to make it all go away.

32:54.339 --> 32:56.739
[birds cawing]

<i>It was the last place</i>

32:58.843 --> 33:00.343
<i>We knew what resided here.</i>

33:00.378 --> 33:02.245
We knew what--

33:06.618 --> 33:08.518
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

33:08.553 --> 33:10.786
- The closer we got
to the bunker,

<i>the more apprehensive I felt.</i>

33:13.057 --> 33:20.997

33:25.069 --> 33:28.104

<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:43.388 --> 33:45.655

33:51.629 --> 33:54.230
You stay here.

34:04.075 --> 34:06.175
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:06.211 --> 34:09.111

My chest felt tight.

34:09.147 --> 34:14.584
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:14.619 --> 34:17.220

34:21.826 --> 34:24.293
<i>Everything that it did</i>
<i>to make me feel helpless.</i>

34:24.329 --> 34:26.162

34:26.197 --> 34:31.667
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:31.703 --> 34:34.704
Leave us alone.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.973
<i>- I was so scared.</i>

34:37.008 --> 34:39.041
Whatever this was,
it was so strong,

34:39.077 --> 34:41.811

34:51.489 --> 34:53.856
- Don't ever leave!

34:53.891 --> 34:55.958
- It was just
the most oppressive thing

I've ever felt in my life.

38:37.114 --> 38:38.914
Once it disappeared

39:57.995 --> 39:58.961
Jeff?

40:01.298 --> 40:02.931
it's threatening us

40:02.967 --> 40:05.834

very unsettling and scary.

about it.

- The scariest thing was

41:14.371 --> 41:17.005
not knowing
where it was coming from.
