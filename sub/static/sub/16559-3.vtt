00:02.463 --> 00:03.964
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.964 --> 00:05.176
- We're gonna play a game.
-Meet Bonnie.

00:05.176 --> 00:06.507
What the hell is this?
Bonnie's childhood.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.389
And that man
is her father.

00:08.389 --> 00:10.091
I love you.

00:10.091 --> 00:11.632
Whatever you want,
I'll do it.

00:11.632 --> 00:13.264
So, please, just let me.

00:13.264 --> 00:14.595
I'm sorry.

00:14.595 --> 00:17.638
Can I crash here
for a while?

00:17.638 --> 00:18.939
We're screwing.

00:18.939 --> 00:20.271
There is
an article on Annalise

00:20.271 --> 00:21.852
in almost
every single paper.

00:21.852 --> 00:23.023
This is a big deal.

00:23.023 --> 00:23.814
You are suspended.

00:23.814 --> 00:24.605
No.

00:24.605 --> 00:26.317
Annalise, please.

00:26.317 --> 00:27.148
No one here --

00:27.148 --> 00:28.819
Lock me
out of my classroom!

00:28.819 --> 00:30.651
Are you worried
Frank's behind the fliers?

00:30.651 --> 00:33.033
You think that Frank might try
to pin Mahoney's shooting on me.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.655
I didn't have a choice.
He's dead.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.288
So, he could be anywhere.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.869
I'm gonna stay at your house
till we find him.

00:38.869 --> 00:41.122
It's Laurel.
She's been calling Frank.

00:41.122 --> 00:42.623
What's the deal
with your father?

00:42.623 --> 00:44.665
He is not a good person.

00:44.665 --> 00:48.089
Frank, I love you.
Please come back to us.

00:48.089 --> 00:51.262
Now you just got to go
see your father.

00:51.262 --> 00:52.933
Wipe it clean.

00:52.933 --> 00:54.475
Everything on it.

00:54.475 --> 00:56.477
Annalise Keating,
you're under arrest.

01:17.958 --> 01:19.410
Pull it together, Hampton.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.303
There was no phone
with your belongings.

01:32.303 --> 01:33.634
Did you lose it?

01:33.634 --> 01:36.217
I must've dropped it when your
colleagues manhandled me.

01:36.217 --> 01:38.309
My job is hard enough without
you giving me attitude.

01:38.309 --> 01:40.060
Here.

01:42.273 --> 01:44.104
Look straight
into the camera, please.

02:28.359 --> 02:29.320
Hey.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.651
Hmm.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.772
Made a smoothie.
You can take it with you.

02:31.772 --> 02:33.444
Does it have bacon in it?

02:33.444 --> 02:35.196
Try it before you judge.

02:42.493 --> 02:43.954
It's good.

02:43.954 --> 02:46.337
Your crack's ready, too.

02:46.337 --> 02:48.289
Oh.

02:48.289 --> 02:50.050
So you know,

02:50.050 --> 02:52.423
I filed a missing person report
on Frank.

02:52.423 --> 02:54.215
What?!

02:54.215 --> 02:55.796
That was a test.

02:55.796 --> 02:58.759
I haven't
done anything -- yet.

02:58.759 --> 02:59.890
Nate.

02:59.890 --> 03:00.851
So, you'd just
rather I wait

03:00.851 --> 03:02.012
until he does
something terrible?

03:02.012 --> 03:04.014
Nothing terrible's
gonna happen.

03:04.014 --> 03:06.227
I'm handling it.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.688
How?

03:21.992 --> 03:24.124
This is all my fault.

03:24.124 --> 03:27.248
I shouldn't
have involved you.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.290
It would be better
for the both of us

03:29.290 --> 03:31.962
if we just keep certain things
separate for a while.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.385
Church and state.
Now you care about that?

03:34.385 --> 03:36.887
I care about
not hurting you again.

03:36.887 --> 03:38.098
You don't trust me.

03:38.098 --> 03:40.220
That's not
what this is about.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.975
Or am I confused about
what exactly we're doing here?

03:44.975 --> 03:49.730
I don't know what we're doing,
but neither do you.

03:49.730 --> 03:54.194
Look, can we just not
decide that right now?

03:54.194 --> 03:56.156
Let's just see
where it goes.

03:58.569 --> 03:59.820
See where it goes, huh?

03:59.820 --> 04:02.162
Mm-hmm.

04:02.162 --> 04:03.994
Okay.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.749
You're gonna make me
late for work again.

04:12.923 --> 04:14.675
Smoothie.

04:24.435 --> 04:26.347
Good morning.

04:28.389 --> 04:30.020
I hope you're here
because you found the person

04:30.020 --> 04:31.602
behind those fliers.

04:31.602 --> 04:32.853
We're still
looking into it.

04:32.853 --> 04:34.485
Look harder.
Annalise, please --

04:34.485 --> 04:36.156
You blindsided me
at the meeting.

04:36.156 --> 04:38.158
And I apologize for that.

04:38.158 --> 04:39.610
I --
But?

04:39.610 --> 04:42.403
Honestly, if I were just
a spectator in that boardroom,

04:42.403 --> 04:43.574
I would've stood up
and cheered.

04:43.574 --> 04:44.665
Maybe you should have.

04:44.665 --> 04:46.116
Then we wouldn't be
in this predicament.

04:46.116 --> 04:48.329
Well, we're in this predicament
because you insist on

04:48.329 --> 04:49.580
making everything a fight.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.291
My entire career's
under attack.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.833
Everything is a fight
for me right now.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.585
Exactly.

04:54.585 --> 04:58.759
I can be on your side
if you just work with me.

04:58.759 --> 05:00.551
You enjoy this?

05:00.551 --> 05:04.014
Being the good girl collecting
gold stars from the board.

05:04.014 --> 05:07.097
You don't know me.

05:10.981 --> 05:14.234
I just came to say that
I think I can manage this.

05:14.234 --> 05:16.357
All I need you to do
is your part.

05:16.357 --> 05:18.148
Keep a low profile.

05:18.148 --> 05:20.701
Might be hard
with my new case.

05:20.701 --> 05:22.282
What does that mean?

05:22.282 --> 05:24.615
Annalise?

05:24.615 --> 05:27.247
Annalise!

05:28.789 --> 05:30.751
Hey, what's that?
Zoom in.

05:30.751 --> 05:32.002
Is she dead?

05:32.002 --> 05:34.044
-She looks dead.
-Holy --

05:34.044 --> 05:38.629
Meet our next client,
Toby Solomon, also known as...?

05:39.720 --> 05:40.841
Mr. Millstone.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.463
The Call Girl Creeper.

05:42.463 --> 05:44.425
He was doing liquid "G" with
an escort when she passed out,

05:44.425 --> 05:46.096
so he dumped her body
outside the apartment.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.599
She died of respiratory failure
two days later.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.561
"She" being
Virginia Michaelson.

05:50.561 --> 05:53.774
Her overdose is caught on
a neighbor's live video feed.

05:53.774 --> 05:55.315
Ms. Gunderson.

05:55.315 --> 05:57.357
Solomon is a heartless
real-estate developer.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.189
In what world does he need
a pro bono clinic?

05:59.189 --> 06:01.111
One -- put aside
your personal feelings

06:01.111 --> 06:02.282
when assessing a client.

06:02.282 --> 06:04.985
Two -- he was bankrupted
by this case.

06:04.985 --> 06:06.116
Because he fired like
10 of his attorneys

06:06.116 --> 06:07.538
when they told him
to take a plea deal.

06:07.538 --> 06:10.290
Five of his attorneys, and don't
speak unless called on.

06:10.290 --> 06:12.413
Now, we're joining
this mid-trial.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.994
The prosecution
is halfway through the case,

06:13.994 --> 06:15.626
and has done a pretty good job
with the jury.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.257
So, how do we undo that?

06:18.839 --> 06:20.631
Really?

06:20.631 --> 06:22.262
I'm handing you
a tabloid murder case,

06:22.262 --> 06:23.674
and no one wants to
sit with me at the table?

06:23.674 --> 06:24.925
I do.

06:24.925 --> 06:26.597
Great, it's your case,
Ms. Pratt.

06:27.508 --> 06:28.719
-What about the contest?
-Do over!

06:28.719 --> 06:30.060
I'll see you
in court tomorrow.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.602
We don't have time for games.

06:31.602 --> 06:33.103
Make me proud.

06:36.817 --> 06:39.109
You're on time. That's one thing
you can get right.

06:39.109 --> 06:40.611
What can I say?

06:40.611 --> 06:42.943
I'm used to working with women
who get paid by the hour.

06:42.943 --> 06:44.284
Who's this?

06:44.284 --> 06:46.787
Ms. Pratt.
She's just joining our team.

06:46.787 --> 06:48.989
You hit on her...

06:48.989 --> 06:50.741
and I'll cut off your balls.

06:51.742 --> 06:53.744
Ms. Perez,
what type of information

06:53.744 --> 06:55.836
were you able to gather
about the defendant,

06:55.836 --> 06:58.208
his Internet activity
in particular?

06:58.208 --> 07:02.422
On average, Mr. Solomon procured
an escort three times a week.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.385
He also had a blog
where he graded the women

07:05.385 --> 07:08.218
based on factors such as
breast size, pubic hair,

07:08.218 --> 07:10.220
and vocal enthusiasm.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.182
I was young.
I don't do that anymore.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.854
Is there
anything else you found

07:13.854 --> 07:15.476
that might be relevant
to this case?

07:15.476 --> 07:17.227
I did a search of
the deleted images

07:17.227 --> 07:19.560
from his Snipcam
and found one particular selfie

07:19.560 --> 07:21.061
that is illuminating.

07:21.061 --> 07:23.774
Objection. This image was not
disclosed to us pre-trial,

07:23.774 --> 07:26.026
thereby violating rule 573.
-Rule 573.

07:26.026 --> 07:27.828
The defendant's Snipcam
cache was always

07:27.828 --> 07:29.119
in the discovery,
Your Honor.

07:29.119 --> 07:31.411
Perhaps Ms. Keating just
didn't search hard enough.

07:31.411 --> 07:34.204
If it requires a computer expert
to decipher discovery,

07:34.204 --> 07:35.626
I move for a continuance.

07:35.626 --> 07:37.788
We can't delay this case
again because the defendant

07:37.788 --> 07:39.500
has a penchant
for changing lawyers.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.713
Let me remind the A.D.A.
that this type of bad faith

07:42.713 --> 07:44.755
data dumping is prohibited
under United States v. Warshak.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.256
-United States v. Warshak.
-Stop.

07:46.256 --> 07:47.297
Let me see the evidence

07:47.297 --> 07:49.389
before making a decision.

07:55.856 --> 07:57.227
Approach.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.480
Please warn me if that's
what I think it is.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.943
That is not a ween
I want to be seeing.

08:07.277 --> 08:09.700
Motion to exclude
on the basis of tampering.

08:09.700 --> 08:13.243
The A.D.A. concealed this
evidence, violating 4910.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.745
I'm offended.
We have fully complied

08:14.745 --> 08:17.287
with our discovery
obligations.

08:17.287 --> 08:20.210
I find no evidence
of bad faith.

08:20.210 --> 08:22.623
Your Honor, this rises to
the level of reversible error.

08:22.623 --> 08:25.125
Your objection is noted
for the record.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.047
Let's continue.

08:28.969 --> 08:31.431
Ms. Perez, at what time
did the defendant

08:31.431 --> 08:33.844
post this selfie
which you will now show us?

08:33.844 --> 08:36.096
-12:13 a.m.
-Let the record state

08:36.096 --> 08:38.268
that this photo was posted
seven minutes before

08:38.268 --> 08:41.732
Mr. Solomon bothered
to call 911.

08:43.103 --> 08:46.817
Seven minutes that could've
saved Virginia's life.

08:46.817 --> 08:48.649
Your witness.

08:51.491 --> 08:53.784
I'd like to appeal for
recusal as first chair

08:53.784 --> 08:55.916
as this case offends
my sensibilities as a woman.

08:55.916 --> 08:57.287
I'm okay
with being offended.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.159
We don't bail
on our clients, Ms. Pratt.

08:59.159 --> 09:00.661
I know. I just think
you'd be better assisted

09:00.661 --> 09:02.583
by a student who's not
so personally disgusted.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.835
Ow!
Mr. Walsh, call your boyfriend,
and have him check

09:04.835 --> 09:07.718
every hidden cavity of Toby's
computer and phone.

09:07.718 --> 09:08.839
Oliver's not his
boyfriend anymore.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.220
What did you do?

09:10.220 --> 09:11.051
It was his decision.
It's fine.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.052
I'll call him.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.634
Everybody else
go back to clinic.

09:13.634 --> 09:14.805
Prep Toby for the stand.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.476
Wait, we're putting
that perv on the stand?

09:16.476 --> 09:18.308
I don't feel like
that's an appropriate way

09:18.308 --> 09:19.389
to speak about a client.

09:19.389 --> 09:22.482
You'll get over it.
Wes.

09:22.482 --> 09:24.104
Have you heard
from Laurel?

09:24.104 --> 09:25.946
Yeah. She's at her
grandmother's funeral.

09:25.946 --> 09:27.147
No, she's not.

09:27.147 --> 09:29.399
I sent her
to see her father.

09:29.399 --> 09:31.031
Why?

09:42.162 --> 09:44.334
I thought I was
meeting you upstairs.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.505
I couldn't wait.

09:45.505 --> 09:46.546
Let me look at you.

09:47.968 --> 09:49.419
"Smart" might also be
a compliment

09:49.419 --> 09:50.550
a daughter likes to hear.

09:50.550 --> 09:52.422
No fights, okay?

09:56.266 --> 09:58.018
This is a social visit,

09:58.018 --> 09:59.389
or are you just here
to find your boyfriend?

09:59.389 --> 10:02.102
Well, we'll talk
in my office.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.855
Decide if this Frank guy
is worth your time.

10:13.824 --> 10:15.365
Did you eat lunch yet?
I can have Diana call down

10:15.365 --> 10:16.536
to the chef, make you
a salad or something.

10:16.536 --> 10:18.158
You're listening
to my calls?

10:18.158 --> 10:20.240
Well, just since you said
you were coming to visit.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.162
You leave a lot
of voicemails for him.

10:22.162 --> 10:24.374
-Dad!
-What choice do you give me?

10:24.374 --> 10:26.416
You throw a fit a Christmas,
you're blocking my e-mails.

10:26.416 --> 10:29.009
Title 18, section 2511
of the U.S. code --

10:29.009 --> 10:30.630
wire tapping is
a federal offense

10:30.630 --> 10:32.052
punishable by incarceration.

10:32.052 --> 10:33.513
Now I'll tell you
that you're smart.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.386
You must be Laurel.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.678
I'm Ursela.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.929
Do you mind
giving us a moment?

10:38.929 --> 10:40.430
I need to speak to my father.

10:40.430 --> 10:42.262
Oh, no, that's why
Ursela's here, m'ija.

10:42.262 --> 10:44.024
I'm the in-house
executive coach.

10:44.024 --> 10:45.686
I specialize
in corporate mediation

10:45.686 --> 10:47.107
and conflict resolution.

10:49.730 --> 10:54.194
We have conflict, and Ursela
here will help us resolve it.

10:54.194 --> 10:56.616
Sit.

11:07.627 --> 11:10.000
-I hate him.
-Who?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.882
Nate. He threw out
all my junk food.

11:11.882 --> 11:13.884
I just hid it, actually.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.968
I love you,
you know that?

11:21.641 --> 11:25.065
So, he's living here now?

11:25.065 --> 11:26.646
You don't approve?

11:26.646 --> 11:28.518
No, Nate's great.

11:28.518 --> 11:30.310
Tell your face that.

11:30.310 --> 11:32.232
It's about the case.

11:32.232 --> 11:34.524
I think we should plea out.

11:34.524 --> 11:36.366
You've been
begging me for weeks

11:36.366 --> 11:38.448
to take a real case,
and now you want to quit?

11:38.448 --> 11:40.660
No one will blame you
for cutting a deal on this one,

11:40.660 --> 11:42.622
and it will help keep
the President out of your hair.

11:42.622 --> 11:44.284
The President can suck it.

11:44.284 --> 11:45.625
Annalise.

11:49.790 --> 11:51.501
I'll talk to the D.A.

11:51.501 --> 11:53.794
Just go and make sure
our client is not trying

11:53.794 --> 11:54.965
to purchase Michaela.

11:59.429 --> 12:01.431
Please, please, please, please
don't show her.

12:01.431 --> 12:02.973
Look, I'll do whatever you want.
I'll have sex with you.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.224
Penetration!

12:04.224 --> 12:05.345
Michaela,
have you seen this?

12:05.345 --> 12:06.937
-Seen what?
-I hate you.

12:06.937 --> 12:10.480
Um, Aiden,
our ex, got engaged.

12:12.813 --> 12:13.984
Her name's Whitney.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.906
Uh, she went to Princeton,
Phi Beta Kappa.

12:15.906 --> 12:18.158
Damn, she's...got
nothing on you,

12:18.158 --> 12:20.120
and you're way more
accomplished.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.071
She's a speech writer

12:21.071 --> 12:22.702
for the Governor of Connecticut,
so...

12:22.702 --> 12:24.164
With a house
in Martha's Vineyard?

12:24.164 --> 12:27.958
Mm-hmm. Looks like her parents
have a place in Oak Bluffs, so.

12:27.958 --> 12:30.791
You're way hotter.
Seriously, you're a 9.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.462
8 if I'm being picky.

12:32.462 --> 12:34.334
Back off, bro.
The lady's taken.

12:34.334 --> 12:35.675
Really? 'Cause it seems
like she's still in love

12:35.675 --> 12:36.877
with that guy.

12:36.877 --> 12:38.758
The lady's taken by me,
okay?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.881
I'm her boo, so just take
your creeping elsewhere.

12:40.881 --> 12:41.882
Asher.

12:45.345 --> 12:47.147
Uh...

12:49.769 --> 12:50.941
I-I wanted to tell you.

12:50.941 --> 12:52.062
It's just we haven't
been alone in a while.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.483
I don't care.

12:53.483 --> 12:55.155
I know.
But I do.

12:55.155 --> 12:57.107
Is anyone
prepping our client,

12:57.107 --> 12:59.569
or are you all
just Googling your exes?

12:59.569 --> 13:00.821
Mostly the latter.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.863
Did he tell you about
my mother?

13:02.863 --> 13:04.574
Oh, please! For once,
can we not talk about this?

13:04.574 --> 13:06.616
Hear that? "For once."
Okay, apparently, you are not

13:06.616 --> 13:08.288
supposed to judge your father
for leaving your mother

13:08.288 --> 13:09.870
in the middle of
a mental-health crisis.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.411
It was a mutual decision.

13:11.411 --> 13:12.752
He met my step-mother
one month later -- Elena.

13:12.752 --> 13:14.044
Shady, right?

13:14.044 --> 13:15.375
Will you help me
out here, please?

13:15.375 --> 13:16.716
No, no, no, don't
put this on her.

13:16.716 --> 13:18.298
It's her job to
not take sides.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.920
That's true,
but I find focusing on

13:19.920 --> 13:22.382
the immediate problems to be
the most effective solution.

13:22.382 --> 13:24.054
I prefer
to discuss the past.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.096
Did he tell you
I was kidnapped when I was 16?

13:27.137 --> 13:29.639
And my father here,
he refused to pay the ransom.

13:29.639 --> 13:32.102
The government wouldn't
allow me to do anything!

13:32.102 --> 13:34.434
Oh, is that why?
I understand.

13:34.434 --> 13:36.066
I'm sorry, I just
thought --

13:36.066 --> 13:37.697
I thought you'd value
your daughter's life

13:37.697 --> 13:38.899
over what the government...
Oh.

13:47.908 --> 13:51.661
Okay, let's stick to English
if I'm gonna help here.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.011
Laurel.

14:01.011 --> 14:04.304
I apologize for all of it.

14:06.806 --> 14:11.521
Every slight I ever committed
against you and your mother.

14:11.521 --> 14:14.394
I want to move on, Laurel,
and I think you do, too.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.530
You know why I came here,
so if you don't want

14:20.530 --> 14:22.612
to give me that,
I'll just go back home.

14:22.612 --> 14:27.908
'Cause this isn't it anymore,
so let me know what you decide.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.546
Nice work
hiding that selfie.

14:36.546 --> 14:38.378
Just stealing
one of your moves.

14:42.802 --> 14:45.215
Well, I'll spare you
the indignity of asking.

14:45.215 --> 14:47.097
I'm not offering
your client any deal.

14:47.097 --> 14:48.848
I haven't even
begun my defense.

14:48.848 --> 14:50.890
You don't know what's
coming down the road.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.642
Is it better than
a selfie with the corpse?

14:52.642 --> 14:54.354
Oh.

14:54.354 --> 14:57.817
Offer me a deal, and you don't
have to worry about it.

14:57.817 --> 15:00.320
Okay.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.652
I feel bad having
to spell this out,

15:02.652 --> 15:05.325
but there's no deal
for you here, Annalise.

15:05.325 --> 15:09.029
And when I say here,
I mean this whole office.

15:09.029 --> 15:11.491
That sounds like
prosecutorial misconduct to me.

15:11.491 --> 15:12.993
No, no.

15:12.993 --> 15:16.916
Just payback
for years of bad behavior.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.129
We're done?

15:26.636 --> 15:28.308
Such confidence.

15:28.308 --> 15:32.052
Another move I stole from you,
I guess.

15:32.052 --> 15:33.723
Except I don't
have to fake it.

15:46.656 --> 15:49.949
Wow. Your heart rate
is in the 90s.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.331
Is that bad?

15:51.331 --> 15:54.414
It's fast, but that's
normal after sex.

15:54.414 --> 15:55.875
I'll just take it
as a compliment.

15:59.839 --> 16:03.423
And what's happening now?

16:03.423 --> 16:05.965
Oh, I'm just feeling for
any abnormal growths.

16:05.965 --> 16:06.966
You want to
celebrate your birthday

16:06.966 --> 16:08.638
with a clean
bill of health.

16:11.801 --> 16:15.355
I swiped your license while you
were in the shower last night.

16:15.355 --> 16:18.018
Why didn't you tell me
it was coming up?

16:18.018 --> 16:19.899
'Cause I hate
my birthday.

16:19.899 --> 16:22.062
Well, that is only
because you've never had me

16:22.062 --> 16:24.194
to celebrate it with you.

16:24.194 --> 16:25.565
I'm gonna make it fun.

16:25.565 --> 16:27.157
I promise.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.504
It's Laurel.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.426
Tell her that I'm really sorry
about her grandmother, okay?

16:46.426 --> 16:47.837
I will.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.724
Hey.

16:54.724 --> 16:57.187
Hey, I'm sorry it took me
so long to call you back.

16:57.187 --> 16:59.099
The mass went on for
really, really long.

16:59.099 --> 17:01.441
Annalise told me
where you are.

17:01.441 --> 17:03.313
My grandmother
did actually die.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.945
Three years ago,
so it wasn't a full-on lie.

17:05.945 --> 17:07.567
I'm not mad.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.239
I just don't want you to do
anything you don't want to do.

17:09.239 --> 17:11.531
Doesn't matter anyway 'cause
my father probably won't help.

17:11.531 --> 17:15.075
Why not?

17:15.075 --> 17:17.117
I'd prefer not talk
about it over the phone.

17:17.117 --> 17:18.328
You sure?

17:18.328 --> 17:19.369
Unless you just
don't want to tell me

17:19.369 --> 17:20.420
anything about your dad

17:20.420 --> 17:23.002
'cause he's some
spy or something.

17:24.124 --> 17:26.756
I'll call you back.

17:26.756 --> 17:27.927
Special delivery.

17:27.927 --> 17:30.049
Pastel de tres leches.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.931
I'm still pissed at you.

17:35.014 --> 17:37.677
Mmm!
Do you want a bite?

17:37.677 --> 17:40.480
Elena's got me on this
whole gluten-free thing.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.851
Since when do you listen
to what she says?

17:41.851 --> 17:43.393
Ah.

17:47.026 --> 17:48.648
Mmm.

17:48.648 --> 17:50.740
I spoke to your mother
last week.

17:50.740 --> 17:52.031
No, it's good.

17:52.031 --> 17:53.193
I was checking up on her.

17:53.193 --> 17:54.994
She told me you spent
the summer there.

17:54.994 --> 17:56.156
Said she was grateful
you came.

17:56.156 --> 17:57.957
Are you gonna tell me
where he is, Dad?

17:57.957 --> 18:01.791
Frank.

18:01.791 --> 18:05.165
You're chasing after a man
who's not worthy of you.

18:05.165 --> 18:06.876
You stalked him, too?

18:06.876 --> 18:08.508
Not yet, but I hear
you leave

18:08.508 --> 18:10.920
these pathetic messages to
a man who clearly

18:10.920 --> 18:12.051
doesn't appreciate you.

18:12.051 --> 18:14.013
No, you don't
appreciate me.

18:16.426 --> 18:18.718
Is it because of me?

18:18.718 --> 18:21.931
That's why you're picking men
who run off on you?

18:21.931 --> 18:23.523
Because you have
daddy issues or something?

18:23.523 --> 18:25.315
Whatever Ursela was saying.

18:25.315 --> 18:27.607
You are a textbook
narcissist.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.898
You know that?

18:28.898 --> 18:31.401
I found him, Laurel.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.533
This wayward
Italian boyfriend of yours.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.155
Hey, how you doin'?

18:35.155 --> 18:38.158
Frank Delfino.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.579
Really?

18:39.579 --> 18:41.241
Where is he?

18:47.377 --> 18:49.709
It's a new investment I need
to put under your name.

18:49.709 --> 18:51.511
I would put it
in your brother's name,

18:51.511 --> 18:53.553
but he's under water
in a deal in Venezuela.

18:53.553 --> 18:55.054
You should leave.

18:57.597 --> 18:59.639
You're a member
of this family,

18:59.639 --> 19:01.060
and you reap
the benefits, m'ija.

19:01.060 --> 19:03.353
That's why I keep wanting
to get out of this family.

19:03.353 --> 19:05.064
Can you please go?

19:28.127 --> 19:30.840
It's Laurel. Leave a message,
but I'll probably never listen.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.842
Hi, just checking in.

19:32.842 --> 19:36.175
Let me know
if you need anything.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.927
Want me to make dinner?

19:37.927 --> 19:40.640
Not if it's in a blender.
I need comfort food.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.392
Everything okay?

19:42.392 --> 19:44.724
Or am I not allowed to ask you
that with our new rules?

19:44.724 --> 19:46.266
Just an idiot client.

19:46.266 --> 19:47.517
I'm fine.

19:48.728 --> 19:50.860
Come in.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.942
It's about the case.

19:59.028 --> 20:00.410
I'll go.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.376
What is it?

20:06.376 --> 20:08.748
Oliver.

20:08.748 --> 20:10.790
What?

20:10.790 --> 20:12.462
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.094
Toby withdrew $200,000
in cash from the bank.

20:15.094 --> 20:17.006
Oliver saw
the e-mail receipt.

20:17.006 --> 20:18.968
-When?
-An hour ago.

20:25.345 --> 20:29.108
I took this case
thinking you were broke.

20:29.108 --> 20:30.690
So, who are you bribing?

20:30.690 --> 20:32.562
A juror?

20:32.562 --> 20:34.193
Or are you just gonna
buy another hooker?

20:34.193 --> 20:36.526
No, I told you
I don't buy sex.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.697
Then what are you doing
with the money?

20:37.697 --> 20:39.659
It's for my last lawyer.

20:39.659 --> 20:41.741
You want to fire me?
Go for it.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.454
He's blackmailing me.

20:44.454 --> 20:46.496
For what?

20:46.496 --> 20:48.918
How do I know you just
won't blackmail me, too?

20:48.918 --> 20:50.460
Well, congratulations.

20:50.460 --> 20:52.462
You've just gone through
six lawyers in one case.

20:52.462 --> 20:53.713
It must be a record.

20:53.713 --> 20:55.254
I'll tell you!

20:55.254 --> 20:58.838
Just you have to
promise not to --

20:58.838 --> 21:02.472
Attorney-client privilege.
Only a hack would blackmail you.

21:02.472 --> 21:05.555
What'd you do?

21:05.555 --> 21:07.847
I killed a girl.

21:07.847 --> 21:09.769
Virginia?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.441
No.

21:13.192 --> 21:15.355
Her name was Janie.

21:23.202 --> 21:25.865
It's all fake, Michaela.

21:25.865 --> 21:27.497
If she were really happy,

21:27.497 --> 21:29.459
she wouldn't have to post
photos of herself looking happy.

21:33.082 --> 21:34.714
Go home.
You're off the case.

21:34.714 --> 21:35.835
But I'm first chair.

21:35.835 --> 21:37.467
No, you just stood up first.
Now go.

21:37.467 --> 21:40.800
Your sensibilities as a woman
should be relieved.

21:42.882 --> 21:44.093
Is that the money?

21:44.093 --> 21:45.304
Doesn't matter.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.426
Just leave.

21:50.229 --> 21:51.310
Well, I'm free
the rest of the night

21:51.310 --> 21:53.232
if you want to grab
a drink or something.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.436
Michaela?

21:56.436 --> 21:57.777
Call Connor.

21:57.777 --> 21:59.649
Tell him we're going out.

22:02.151 --> 22:05.445
She was just some girl
I met on the street.

22:05.445 --> 22:07.206
A hooker?

22:07.206 --> 22:08.658
No.

22:08.658 --> 22:10.450
I don't think so.

22:10.450 --> 22:13.122
She was a runaway.

22:13.122 --> 22:14.584
Janie Sherwin.

22:14.584 --> 22:16.716
Missing since April, 2012.

22:19.168 --> 22:21.090
She was 18.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.056
That's her.

22:27.056 --> 22:30.269
It's good, right?

22:30.269 --> 22:33.973
So. You like baseball,
I assume?

22:33.973 --> 22:35.104
Yeah.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.816
Baseball and hot girls.

22:36.816 --> 22:39.569
I think
you got the wrong idea.

22:39.569 --> 22:41.441
I just got triggered.

22:41.441 --> 22:44.404
I know it -- it doesn't
make it okay, but...

22:44.404 --> 22:47.617
You seriously thought
that we were gonna hook up?

22:47.617 --> 22:50.079
I mean...look at you.

22:50.079 --> 22:51.751
You shouldn't talk
to people like that.

22:51.751 --> 22:53.793
Just keeping it real.

22:53.793 --> 22:56.706
It's harder
than people think...

22:56.706 --> 23:00.500
going through life like this,
getting bullied for how I look.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.342
Join a gym.
Get some plastic surgery.

23:03.342 --> 23:06.466
Maybe then someone will have
sex with you, because honestly,

23:06.466 --> 23:09.469
even if you gave me
all the coke in the world,

23:09.469 --> 23:13.312
nothing's worth
the PTSD of having

23:13.312 --> 23:16.566
your gross, sweaty,
hairy-ass body on top of mine.

23:16.566 --> 23:19.779
Like, I would rather swallow
a jar of razor blades --

23:24.614 --> 23:26.616
We've all been called names.

23:30.950 --> 23:35.374
What'd you do with her?

23:35.374 --> 23:39.919
There's an abandoned warehouse
I almost bought in Manayunk.

23:42.502 --> 23:45.044
I left her
in a broken freezer.

23:54.013 --> 23:55.645
Turn up the A/C 'cause we
about to destroy this joint!

23:55.645 --> 23:57.106
That's right, baby!
We in you, Atlantic city!

23:57.106 --> 23:58.648
--So, what's our plan?

23:58.648 --> 24:00.319
Drink enough to forget
that gay Aiden's

24:00.319 --> 24:01.481
getting straight married?

24:01.481 --> 24:02.862
Drunk enough
to forget men exist.

24:02.862 --> 24:04.403
Except for us, right?
'Cause we're the woke ones.

24:04.403 --> 24:07.867
Hey. Uh, can I just say
how happy this makes me,

24:07.867 --> 24:11.330
that we can hang out
and not make this weird?

24:11.330 --> 24:13.663
Uh, what? You thought
I couldn't do that?

24:13.663 --> 24:15.705
Of -- Of course I did.

24:15.705 --> 24:19.458
I just, uh -- it means a lot
to me that we can be friends.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.421
I never said
that we're friends.

24:22.421 --> 24:24.884
Let's see how the night goes.
Maybe we can get there.

24:28.257 --> 24:29.719
-It's 20 grand.
-Whoa.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.140
-Where did you get that?
-Borrowed it from Toby.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.722
Wait, that's why
you wanted to come here?

24:32.722 --> 24:34.393
In what world did you think it
was okay to steal that money?

24:34.393 --> 24:35.855
-This is stolen money?
-He's kidding.

24:35.855 --> 24:37.396
It's my husband's.
Bastard's cheating on me.

24:37.396 --> 24:38.938
Can you believe it?
We're getting
the hell out of here.

24:38.938 --> 24:40.229
Go if you want to.
I'm happy right here.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.601
All on black.
-Michaela, what -- okay.

24:41.601 --> 24:42.982
No more bets.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.443
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

24:44.443 --> 24:46.105
Oh, my God.

24:49.028 --> 24:50.610
8, black.

25:03.382 --> 25:07.717
There are no bad ideas
right now.

25:07.717 --> 25:09.719
We tell the D.A.

25:09.719 --> 25:11.220
Except that one.

25:11.220 --> 25:13.092
You need good press.

25:13.092 --> 25:14.764
What's better than
helping recover the body

25:14.764 --> 25:15.895
of a missing girl?

25:15.895 --> 25:17.436
We haven't even seen
the body yet.

25:17.436 --> 25:19.138
For all we know,
it doesn't even exist.

25:19.138 --> 25:23.442
Then just say
you were compelled...

25:23.442 --> 25:25.775
...for moral
and ethical reasons.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.276
Like they'll believe that.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.028
It's -- it's cute, though.

25:37.496 --> 25:41.540
Janie's mother still updates
the website every week.

25:41.540 --> 25:45.544
People still e-mail
thinking they spotted Janie.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.507
And Rebecca?

25:48.507 --> 25:50.630
You gonna tell the police
where to find her body, too?

25:54.013 --> 25:55.434
It could've been me.

25:58.768 --> 26:01.230
If the police hadn't caught
my father, I would've run away.

26:02.732 --> 26:04.233
Ended up on the street.

26:06.816 --> 26:08.898
But that didn't happen.

26:10.860 --> 26:13.863
Because someone
did the right thing.

26:14.533 --> 26:18.537
I can call in
an anonymous tip.

26:18.537 --> 26:20.750
No one will know
it was me.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.002
Toby will know.

26:41.180 --> 26:44.223
You can sleep here.

26:44.223 --> 26:46.355
I can tell Nate to leave.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.819
We can eat ice cream in bed,
watch a bad movie.

26:52.732 --> 26:54.784
I won't call the police.

26:58.327 --> 27:01.580
I just don't see any reason
why you should be alone.

27:06.706 --> 27:08.708
I'm just tired.

27:13.803 --> 27:15.675
I'll go.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.439
13, black.

27:32.231 --> 27:34.193
80 grand
in the bank, bitch!

27:34.193 --> 27:35.324
-Whoo!
-What'd I say?

27:35.324 --> 27:36.655
Always bet black!

27:36.655 --> 27:37.907
And I'll never go back!

27:37.907 --> 27:39.198
No.

27:39.198 --> 27:40.489
-You staying in the hotel?
-No, no, no.

27:40.489 --> 27:41.330
We're only here
for the night.

27:41.330 --> 27:42.912
Oh! Okay, cool.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.704
I'll tell you, if she keeps
playing like this...
Oh, hell no.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.245
...they're gonna comp you guys
a suite probably.
Oh, yeah?

27:46.245 --> 27:47.126
Yeah. You got to
throw a party.

27:47.126 --> 27:48.377
Oh.
You should.

27:48.377 --> 27:50.840
They give you one of those,
uh -- the Jacuzzi tubs.

27:53.292 --> 27:55.715
Dude, you got to put
your peen between the O-man

27:55.715 --> 27:56.756
and that him-bo
over there.

27:56.756 --> 27:58.928
Yeah, he's hot.
You're hot, okay?

27:58.928 --> 28:00.800
So go over there
and show that queen who's boss.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.561
We broke up, Asher.

28:02.561 --> 28:04.473
That doesn't mean you just
quit him, brokeback.

28:04.473 --> 28:05.644
You got to fight for it.

28:05.644 --> 28:07.897
He quit on me!
Okay?

28:07.897 --> 28:10.149
He's very secure
in his decision.

28:10.149 --> 28:11.360
He doesn't
want to be with me.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.812
Maybe he wants to be with
that guy, I don't know.

28:12.812 --> 28:13.943
But you trying to be
our Yenta or --

28:13.943 --> 28:16.025
or parent trapping us
or whatever,

28:16.025 --> 28:17.656
it's really not helpful.

28:19.658 --> 28:21.240
Walshy needs a hug.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.743
-No.
-27, red.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.084
Did she just say red?

28:25.084 --> 28:27.997
Oh, no.
No! No! No! No! No!

28:56.025 --> 29:00.569
Hey, you need a drink?
It's rum and Coke.

29:00.569 --> 29:02.491
Uh, you know,
I'm actually driving,

29:02.491 --> 29:04.573
but you -- you should
give it to Oliver.

29:04.573 --> 29:05.704
That's his drink.

29:05.704 --> 29:07.326
Yeah, but I, uh --
I brought it to you.

29:07.326 --> 29:08.998
I'm saying he's
the better choice, so...

29:08.998 --> 29:12.041
Look, he's
a monster in bed.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.672
Asian guys
aren't really my type.

29:13.672 --> 29:15.754
But, uh, you...

29:18.137 --> 29:19.428
So, you're a bigot?

29:19.428 --> 29:21.380
What are you talking about?
I'm stating a preference.

29:21.380 --> 29:22.591
Let me guess, you're --

29:22.591 --> 29:24.643
you're only into masc dudes,
too, right?

29:24.643 --> 29:26.015
Your Humpr profile, it's all,

29:26.015 --> 29:27.887
"No fats, no femmes,
no blacks, no Asians."

29:27.887 --> 29:29.809
Look, man, I think you just
need to relax.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.020
Or I need
to kick your ass!

29:31.020 --> 29:33.102
Hey, what's going on?

29:36.195 --> 29:37.656
I think I'm gonna
go find my friends.

29:41.951 --> 29:43.903
What did you say?

29:43.903 --> 29:45.955
Nothing, but, you know,
dodged a bullet.

29:45.955 --> 29:47.867
Because you sabotaged me.

29:47.867 --> 29:48.828
No.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.249
No, I would never do that.

29:50.249 --> 29:52.291
Except you just did.

29:52.291 --> 29:56.585
Walshy. Please, please, please
tell me you just won 20k

29:56.585 --> 29:58.377
on the slots.

29:58.377 --> 29:59.588
Hmm? What?

29:59.588 --> 30:00.719
I lost
some of the money.

30:00.719 --> 30:03.092
No, not some of it.
All of it.

30:03.092 --> 30:05.925
Like we have zero left,
zilch, negative Benjamins.

30:05.925 --> 30:07.136
Michaela.

30:07.136 --> 30:08.727
I just wanted
to have fun.

30:08.727 --> 30:10.689
Yeah, well, I'm having
a lot of fun.

30:10.689 --> 30:13.522
How about you guys?

30:13.522 --> 30:15.814
I still pray
I'll open the door

30:15.814 --> 30:18.277
and she'll be standing there,

30:18.277 --> 30:21.490
that I'll be able
to hold her again.

30:21.490 --> 30:24.944
Mama's still here
for you, baby girl.

30:24.944 --> 30:27.326
I'll always be waiting for you.

30:38.167 --> 30:39.838
You gonna
keep that up all night?

30:39.838 --> 30:42.301
Probably.

30:43.382 --> 30:44.924
Frank stuff?

30:44.924 --> 30:46.675
No.

30:48.637 --> 30:51.060
How about this?

30:51.060 --> 30:53.562
What's said in the dark
doesn't leave this room.

30:53.562 --> 30:55.184
That applies
to the both of us.

30:55.184 --> 30:57.106
What secrets
do you have?

30:57.106 --> 30:59.688
Right now,
we're focused on you.

31:05.154 --> 31:06.865
There's a dead girl
in a freezer,

31:06.865 --> 31:09.448
and I can't
do anything about it.

31:27.676 --> 31:29.058
Hey, Frank.

31:29.058 --> 31:31.430
You think I'm stupid,
don't you?

31:31.430 --> 31:33.272
Think I'm gonna fall
for those voicemails?

31:33.272 --> 31:34.063
No, Frank.

31:34.063 --> 31:36.105
Annalise isn't mad at you.

31:36.105 --> 31:38.357
She tried to kill me,
Laurel.

31:38.357 --> 31:40.940
She tell you that?
Just tell her this, okay?

31:40.940 --> 31:42.151
We're even.

31:42.151 --> 31:43.192
Wait, don't say
anything else.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.284
No need to send any more
hit men my way.

31:45.284 --> 31:47.486
Just --

31:57.456 --> 32:00.499
Sorry.

32:00.499 --> 32:02.881
I saw you flirting,
and I got jealous,

32:02.881 --> 32:06.135
so I told him...to back off.

32:06.135 --> 32:07.466
It won't happen again.

32:07.466 --> 32:08.887
No, it will.
It's fine.

32:08.887 --> 32:10.469
You're allowed to be
angry with me,

32:10.469 --> 32:12.351
but it's not like
I was gonna go

32:12.351 --> 32:15.934
hook up with the guy
in the bathroom.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.397
Yeah, no, I know. I --

32:18.397 --> 32:20.189
Sorry.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.650
I don't want you
to be sorry.

32:21.650 --> 32:25.364
I want you
to act like an adult.

32:25.364 --> 32:26.195
You're right.

32:26.195 --> 32:29.158
I will do better.

32:29.158 --> 32:32.411
-So, do we have a deal?
-$15,000. Take it or leave it.

32:32.411 --> 32:34.833
That's a 2.5 karat
with D color

32:34.833 --> 32:38.537
and flawless clarity that
he -- that I paid $45,000 for.

32:38.537 --> 32:40.709
And this is
a 24/7 pawn shop.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.671
You don't like it,
go on eBay.

32:42.671 --> 32:44.083
$30,000.
$16,000.

32:44.083 --> 32:45.384
$28,000.
$17,000.

32:45.384 --> 32:47.176
$21,000 or I file a report
with the FTC

32:47.176 --> 32:48.887
that you entered
into a negotiation of sale

32:48.887 --> 32:51.180
before confirming that I was
the legal owner of the ring,

32:51.180 --> 32:55.144
resulting in you
losing your license.

32:55.144 --> 32:56.805
Okay, that was hot.

32:56.805 --> 32:59.358
Like, I want you to sit
on my face right now hot.

32:59.358 --> 33:01.560
And a grand in profit?
Are you kidding me?

33:01.560 --> 33:03.732
He was like,
"This is not eBay."

33:06.565 --> 33:08.067
That's 1,000 bucks.

33:08.067 --> 33:10.319
I could use that.

33:10.319 --> 33:12.071
It's blood money.

33:15.914 --> 33:18.917
I got arrested
the night Virginia died.

33:18.917 --> 33:21.710
I spent a couple nights
in the county jail

33:21.710 --> 33:23.712
before my lawyer
could get bail.

33:23.712 --> 33:25.254
And during this time,

33:25.254 --> 33:27.216
did you speak
to any other inmates?

33:27.216 --> 33:31.009
Yes, there was a, uh,
man in my cell block.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.391
-Why is he on the stand?
-Shh.

33:32.391 --> 33:35.134
And what did
this man tell you?

33:35.134 --> 33:39.268
He asked me if I knew
about this girl Janie Sherwin

33:39.268 --> 33:40.439
from the news.

33:40.439 --> 33:44.403
And why did he seem
interested in this girl?

33:44.403 --> 33:46.565
He said he'd killed her
and hid her in a freezer.

33:46.565 --> 33:47.696
Objection. Relevance.

33:47.696 --> 33:49.148
My client is trying
to tell the truth

33:49.148 --> 33:50.609
about this girl
who's been missing for years.

33:50.609 --> 33:52.451
-Again, relevance.
-It's relevant because

33:52.451 --> 33:54.533
it proves my client has been
unable to get a fair trial

33:54.533 --> 33:55.914
in the city
of Philadelphia.

33:55.914 --> 33:57.866
-Objection. Inflammatory.
-A very serious accusation,

33:57.866 --> 33:59.618
Ms. Keating.
-You want proof?

33:59.618 --> 34:01.330
Here.

34:01.330 --> 34:03.372
I'd like to enter into evidence
a prison record sheet

34:03.372 --> 34:05.664
of my client the night
he was arrested.

34:05.664 --> 34:08.427
You'll see that he was
placed in the same cell block

34:08.427 --> 34:10.839
as an inmate named
Jackson Terry...

34:10.839 --> 34:13.722
Jackson Terry's got four counts
of first-degree murder,

34:13.722 --> 34:15.053
all women, all violent.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.136
You just say they crossed paths.
Terry confessed.

34:17.136 --> 34:19.138
...who confessed
his crime to my client.

34:19.138 --> 34:21.560
Now, it was not my intention
to discuss this matter

34:21.560 --> 34:23.982
in open court,
but Ms. Atwood refused

34:23.982 --> 34:26.685
to even hear my offer yesterday.

34:26.685 --> 34:28.777
Because Ms. Keating never said
anything about a murdered girl.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.189
I never had the chance.

34:30.189 --> 34:31.820
In fact, Ms. Atwood
inferred that no one

34:31.820 --> 34:33.742
in the D.A.'s office
would negotiate with me.

34:33.742 --> 34:34.863
That is a lie,
Your Honor.

34:34.863 --> 34:36.455
Did we not meet yesterday
in your office?

34:36.455 --> 34:37.576
Yes --
Did you not say

34:37.576 --> 34:39.458
that my reputation
was the sole reason

34:39.458 --> 34:41.870
why you wouldn't negotiate with
me, which let's be clear,

34:41.870 --> 34:44.583
is the very definition
of prosecutorial bias.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.835
Judge, I can explain.
You should explain.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.508
To Janie Sherwin's mother,
Sharon, who's been suffering

34:49.508 --> 34:51.970
for years not knowing whether
her daughter's dead or alive.

34:51.970 --> 34:54.213
My client is attempting
to end that suffering,

34:54.213 --> 34:56.595
but your prejudice
against me won't allow it.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.558
Your Honor, it's no secret
that my reputation has suffered

34:59.558 --> 35:00.599
in this courthouse.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.141
I can handle it.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.892
But I won't allow it
to keep my client

35:03.892 --> 35:05.774
from getting a fair trial.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.941
Three years. You just
need to plead guilty

35:12.941 --> 35:14.193
to involuntary
manslaughter.

35:14.193 --> 35:15.654
Three years in jail?

35:15.654 --> 35:17.696
You let one woman die
in the street

35:17.696 --> 35:19.408
and another
rot in a freezer.

35:19.408 --> 35:20.869
God knows
you deserve worse.

35:20.869 --> 35:24.082
But I hired you because you said
you'd get me no jail time!

35:28.297 --> 35:30.169
You killed
two innocent women,

35:30.169 --> 35:32.341
and you still think
you get to complain?

35:32.341 --> 35:34.553
Say you'll take the deal!

35:34.553 --> 35:36.715
Say it!

35:36.715 --> 35:38.096
Okay.

35:48.397 --> 35:51.360
Is this a goodbye, or should
I call Ursela back in again?

35:51.360 --> 35:52.321
No need.

35:52.321 --> 35:54.903
I just came
to drop this off.

36:05.544 --> 36:08.377
I, uh,
can't thank you enough.

36:08.377 --> 36:10.919
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

36:14.593 --> 36:16.174
It's quite clever.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.508
He used a pretty sophisticated
program to hide his location,

36:19.508 --> 36:23.932
but we were able to find him
in a town called Coalport.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.646
It's near Pittsburgh.

36:27.646 --> 36:32.110
He's been there
about a week.

36:32.110 --> 36:33.692
I'll let you
get back to work.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.365
How well do you know
this man, m'ija?

36:36.365 --> 36:38.116
I'm an adult.
I can decide

36:38.116 --> 36:40.619
who I want in my life,
so no more spying on me.

36:40.619 --> 36:42.120
No more bugging my phone.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.082
I wouldn't need to if you'd
just return my calls.

36:44.082 --> 36:46.665
Listen.

36:46.665 --> 36:48.377
I know why you're angry.

36:48.377 --> 36:49.748
I understand.

36:49.748 --> 36:51.750
I never saw you,

36:51.750 --> 36:55.754
not this person
you've become.

36:55.754 --> 36:58.096
I see her now.

36:58.096 --> 37:01.470
You've taken everything
you've been through,

37:01.470 --> 37:06.345
all the pain, and you
turned it into strength.

37:06.345 --> 37:09.848
And for that,
I am proud of you.

37:09.848 --> 37:13.021
Very, very proud.

37:15.614 --> 37:20.359
Por favor, please don't ever
disappear on me like that again.

37:23.572 --> 37:25.284
Okay.

37:29.418 --> 37:31.129
I'm sorry.

37:35.634 --> 37:37.296
Can I help you?

37:37.296 --> 37:40.218
Or did you just come to
return the money you stole?

37:40.218 --> 37:42.881
It was beyond stupid.

37:42.881 --> 37:43.802
I know.

37:43.802 --> 37:46.435
I was just angry at men,

37:46.435 --> 37:49.187
especially rich ones who don't
appreciate what they have.

37:51.940 --> 37:53.312
Just put it back.

38:01.490 --> 38:05.113
Bonnie.

38:05.113 --> 38:06.825
I'm sorry about Asher.
We were gonna tell you --

38:06.825 --> 38:08.246
God, you just ruined it.

38:08.246 --> 38:09.998
What?

38:09.998 --> 38:13.752
We don't need to make this
a thing, Michaela.

38:13.752 --> 38:15.584
Bone whoever you want.

38:19.217 --> 38:21.590
What do I do with this?

38:21.590 --> 38:24.473
Keep it. See if he has
the nerve to ask for it back.

38:24.473 --> 38:25.924
Look.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.192
President Hargrove?

38:34.192 --> 38:35.734
What is it, Candice?

38:35.734 --> 38:37.356
Barry Lewiston
is on the phone.

38:39.488 --> 38:40.989
Of course he is.

38:42.941 --> 38:45.283
Hi, Barry.

38:45.283 --> 38:47.866
Yes, I am reading it right now.

38:51.249 --> 38:54.373
It's Laurel. Leave a message,
but I'll probably never listen.

38:55.414 --> 38:57.295
Hey. Are you back?

38:57.295 --> 39:00.589
Call me.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.676
Sorry, I was just, uh --

39:07.676 --> 39:09.558
Calling Laurel?

39:09.558 --> 39:10.769
I know.

39:14.182 --> 39:16.475
I'm about to start
my E.R. rotation.

39:18.236 --> 39:21.980
And people's lives literally
will depend on me.

39:21.980 --> 39:24.242
Instead of me focusing on that,
I've been stressing about

39:24.242 --> 39:25.784
what to get you
for your birthday

39:25.784 --> 39:27.155
while you're into
some other girl.

39:27.155 --> 39:28.246
It's not like that.

39:28.246 --> 39:30.368
I want to believe you.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.331
But then I see your face when
her name shows up on your phone.

39:33.331 --> 39:34.583
My face?

39:34.583 --> 39:38.336
You get...happy.

39:38.336 --> 39:41.209
In a way, that makes me
happy for you.

39:41.209 --> 39:42.671
Because God knows
that you deserve

39:42.671 --> 39:45.093
nothing but good things
at this point in your life.

39:46.344 --> 39:48.467
You're the good thing
in my life.

39:48.467 --> 39:50.639
Not Laurel.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.100
It's you.

39:55.353 --> 39:59.357
You don't have to get me
anything for my birthday.

39:59.357 --> 40:01.019
Too late.

40:06.615 --> 40:08.657
I'm sorry I didn't
call you back.

40:08.657 --> 40:11.660
I got a little paranoid
using the phone around my dad.

40:11.660 --> 40:14.162
It's fine.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.914
Did he find Frank?

40:15.914 --> 40:18.457
Yes, but he wouldn't
tell me where he was

40:18.457 --> 40:20.959
unless I signed
my soul over to him,

40:20.959 --> 40:23.882
and I couldn't do it,
not again.

40:23.882 --> 40:26.545
I'm sorry,
I really wanted to help.

40:27.546 --> 40:30.098
Fathers suck.

40:30.098 --> 40:33.351
I think we can
all agree on that.

40:33.351 --> 40:34.853
Yeah.

40:37.896 --> 40:39.938
I think we all need a drink.

40:42.651 --> 40:45.403
No!

41:02.501 --> 41:05.043
Excuse me. Sorry.

41:05.043 --> 41:07.966
Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me.

41:09.678 --> 41:11.089
What are you doing here?

41:11.089 --> 41:13.181
Annalise called me from jail.
Did you do it?

41:13.181 --> 41:14.222
Do what?

41:14.222 --> 41:15.303
The phone.

41:15.303 --> 41:16.555
She sent me to find you.

41:16.555 --> 41:18.857
It's clean.

41:18.857 --> 41:19.978
Good.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.309
Follow me.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.402
Now, Miss, you need
clearance to come in --

41:24.402 --> 41:27.275
I'm Annalise Keating's lawyer.
This is her house.

41:27.275 --> 41:29.738
John!

41:29.738 --> 41:32.611
All right.

41:36.414 --> 41:38.116
Come on, Bonnie.
This is an active crime scene.

41:38.116 --> 41:39.497
Just tell me
what the charges are,

41:39.497 --> 41:40.709
and I'll get
out of your hair.

41:40.709 --> 41:41.880
And have the chief
tear me a new one?

41:41.880 --> 41:43.582
I don't think so.

41:43.582 --> 41:45.293
Are you not telling me
because you don't have a case?

41:45.293 --> 41:47.385
This arrest is just
for headlines?

41:47.385 --> 41:50.799
Look, you'll get your charges
soon enough, just not from me.

41:50.799 --> 41:53.011
You can only hold her for
48 hours without charging her.

41:53.011 --> 41:53.762
Yeah, and that's --

41:53.762 --> 41:55.433
Hold up!

41:55.433 --> 41:56.895
Everybody quiet!

41:56.895 --> 41:59.307
Rescue 1.
Rescue 1 priority.

41:59.307 --> 42:02.230
This is Gaines.
Talk to me.

42:02.230 --> 42:04.983
We have another occupant.
We're bringing them out now.

42:04.983 --> 42:06.314
Status?

42:08.486 --> 42:09.778
Status?!

42:09.778 --> 42:12.110
There's a pulse.
I repeat, we have a pulse.

42:12.110 --> 42:13.702
Get an ambulance ready.

42:13.702 --> 42:16.204
Line up a police escort
for the hospital.

42:16.204 --> 42:18.116
Come on, everyone!
Let's go!
