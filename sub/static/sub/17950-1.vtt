00:11.545 --> 00:13.047
IT COULD WIPE OUT
EVERYTHING WE KNOW.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.382
- YOU KNOW
IT'S A SPITBALL FIGHT,

00:14.482 --> 00:15.616
NOT AN ALIEN INVASION.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.151

OUR HUGE SUMMER TOUR.

00:37.037 --> 00:37.971

00:38.072 --> 00:39.707
AS LONG AS WE ALL
STICK TOGETHER,

00:39.807 --> 00:42.610
NOTHING CAN STOP
BIG TIME RUSH.

00:42.710 --> 00:43.777
NOW LET'S DESTROY CARLOS.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.191

THAT WILL SURELY LEAVE

WE'RE BEING INVADED!

02:41.629 --> 02:44.432
[dramatic music]

02:44.532 --> 02:47.935
- AND NICE DANCE SORT OF.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.670
- I WASN'T DANCING.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.572
I'M CLEANING.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.808
AND NOW I'M--I'M CLEANING
THE BACK HALLWAY.

02:57.245 --> 03:00.548
- ENOUGH WITH THE SPITBALLS.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.816
THE BRITISH
ARE NOT ACTUALLY INVADING.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.117
- OH, REALLY?

03:04.252 --> 03:06.053
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MONTH'S
POP TIGER?

03:06.153 --> 03:08.789
WE'RE NOWHERE ON THE COVER,

03:08.889 --> 03:09.990
AND BESIDES ONE "D"
AND THE WANTED,

03:10.090 --> 03:13.126
LOOK WHO ELSE IS INVADING
OUR GREAT LAND:

03:13.261 --> 03:15.296
HAIR 3,

03:15.396 --> 03:16.964
COLORFUL PANTS.

03:17.064 --> 03:20.668
DON'T FORGET SIMON COWELL'S
NEXT BOY BAND.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.271
- DON'T PANIC.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.273
WE ARE IN HERE.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.542
HERE'S LOGAN'S ADORABLE
"CALL ME" POSTER.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.877
- IT'S CUTE.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.281
- AND JAMES,
WHO WILL WORK FOR HUGS.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.282
- I WILL!

03:34.348 --> 03:36.284
- OKAY, SO THAT'S 2 OF OURS

03:36.384 --> 03:37.985
TO 18 OF THEIRS.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.353
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

03:39.453 --> 03:41.289
- SIMON COWELL.

03:41.322 --> 03:45.293
HE MANAGES ALL OF THESE BANDS
AND HAS AN ARMY HELPING HIM.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.528
GUSTAVO, ON THE OTHER HAND,
DOES EVERYTHING HIMSELF.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.863
FOR A MAN HIS SIZE,
HE'S SPREAD VERY THIN.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.800
- WE NEED A NEW MANAGER.
KATIE, BE OUR NEW MANAGER.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.867
- CAN'T.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.369
MONTHLY LEASES ENDED YESTERDAY,

03:55.469 --> 03:59.106
AND I AM GOING DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE
IF ANY GIRLS MY AGE MOVED IN.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.574
I LOVE YOU GUYS,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.743
BUT YOU'RE NOT GIRLS
WHO I CAN TALK ABOUT BOYS WITH.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.046
- HUH!

04:06.146 --> 04:08.349
WE CAN TALK ABOUT BOYS.
- YEAH.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.318
- AND WE DO NOT NEED
A NEW MANAGER.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.753
- BUT STATISTICS DO SHOW

04:12.853 --> 04:15.088
NEW MANAGERS REINVIGORATE
LAGGING COMPANIES.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.090
- SMART TALK.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.859
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE OUTNUMBERED.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.961
TELL HIM WHERE YOU STAND,
INVASION BUDDY OF MINE.

04:21.061 --> 04:24.131
[dramatic music rises]

04:24.231 --> 04:25.399
- I'M ON THIS SIDE.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.335
- OH, YOU JUST MADE
A BIG MISTAKE.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.536
HUH!

04:28.636 --> 04:29.837
*

04:29.937 --> 04:32.005
- OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.475
- WE ARE GOING BACK
TO ROCQUE RECORDS

04:34.575 --> 04:37.811
TO SEE HOW GUSTAVO,
OUR MANAGER,

04:37.911 --> 04:40.514
PLANS ON HANDLING
THIS INVASION.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.982
- HEY.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.384
YOU GUYS WANT TO GO
TO THE POOL?

04:43.484 --> 04:44.985
- NOT A GOOD TIME, LADIES!

04:45.085 --> 04:46.354
- TRYING TO STOP
AN INVASION HERE!

04:46.387 --> 04:49.189
[martial drumming]

04:49.357 --> 04:51.825
- AS ONE "D" AND THE WANTED
LAUNCH THEIR SUMMER TOURS

04:51.925 --> 04:55.396
IN BOSTON AND ATLANTA,

04:55.496 --> 04:57.665
WE WILL LAUNCH OURS IN D.C.,

04:57.765 --> 04:59.767
THUS PROTECTING THE CAPITOL.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.101
- BUT THE NEXT NIGHT,

05:01.201 --> 05:03.604
THEY ADVANCE TO RICHMOND
AND BALTIMORE.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.173
- SO WE FALL BACK
TO KANSAS CITY.

05:06.273 --> 05:10.143
- BUT THAT'S WHEN HAIR 3,
COLORFUL PANTS...

05:10.243 --> 05:12.913
- AND S.C.N.B.B. START
THEIR TOURS.

05:13.013 --> 05:18.719
- THEN ALL OF THE BANDS MOVE
INTO THE INTERIOR CITIES...

05:18.819 --> 05:20.954
- WHICH MEANS...

05:21.054 --> 05:23.457
- YOU'RE SURROUNDED.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.759
- ARE YOU HERE TO HELP US
OR MAKE US FEEL BAD?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.395
- YES.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.564
AND THE AMERICAN-BRITISH
MUSIC RIVALRY IS NOTHING NEW.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.865
WHEN THE BEATLES INVADED
IN THE '60s,

05:31.965 --> 05:35.102
THEY WIPED OUT ELVIS
AND THE AMERICAN ROCK SCENE.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.472
SO WE RETALIATED
WITH THE DANCE SOUNDS OF DISCO.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.807
THEN THEY LAUNCHED
A NEW WAVE OFFENSIVE

05:39.907 --> 05:41.274
THAT WASHED AWAY
OUR DANCE REBELLION

05:41.409 --> 05:44.412
AND RENDERED
ALL MY WHITE SUITS USELESS.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.480
BUT GRUNGE BROUGHT AMERICA BACK.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.282
AND ALTHOUGH THEIR ANGST-FILLED
LYRICS MADE ME SAD,

05:49.417 --> 05:51.018
IT MADE ME MONEY.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.421
- RIGHT, SO YOU WANT US
TO FIGHT OFF THE INVASION

05:53.521 --> 05:54.855
WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT.

05:54.955 --> 05:55.856
- CLOSE.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.458
I WANT YOU TO SURRENDER.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.692
IT'S TIME TO DITCH
THE BOY BANDS

05:58.792 --> 06:00.894
AND FIND MUSIC'S NEXT BIG THING.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.430
[together]
WE CAN'T SURRENDER.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.497
- SURE YOU CAN.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.433
JUST WAVE THESE.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.501
FROM NOW ON, THIS STUDIO
AND ITS RESOURCES

06:07.601 --> 06:10.904
WILL BE USED SOLELY TO FIND
THE NEXT WAVE OF MUSIC.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.305
SORRY, BOYS.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.306
IT'S OVER.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.307
IT'S BEEN FUN,

06:14.442 --> 06:15.443
BUT IT'S OVER.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.581
[dramatic drumming]

06:20.681 --> 06:23.116
- WE'RE NOT WAVING THESE!

06:23.216 --> 06:25.052
- YOU ARE!

06:25.152 --> 06:26.720
[deflated trumpet fanfare]

06:26.820 --> 06:27.988
- I CAN FIX THIS.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.322
I'M A MEGA SONGWRITER,

06:29.457 --> 06:31.158
PRODUCER, AND MANAGER.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.893
I'M A TRIPLE THREAT!

06:32.993 --> 06:34.762
- OR MAYBE YOU'RE SPREAD
TOO THIN.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.464
- WHAT?

06:36.530 --> 06:39.633
- MAYBE WE NEED A NEW MANAGER...

06:39.733 --> 06:43.471
WITH FRESH IDEAS THAT
INVIGORATES THINGS AND STUFF.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.539
- OH, OKAY, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:45.639 --> 06:48.008
YOU GUYS GO OUT
AND FIND A NEW MANAGER

06:48.108 --> 06:50.210
THAT'LL BRING SOME FRESH IDEAS
TO THE BAND

06:50.310 --> 06:51.812
TO HELP DEFEAT
THE BRITISH INVASION.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.981
- YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

06:54.081 --> 06:56.349
- I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
WITH THAT!

06:56.484 --> 07:00.253
ENJOY YOUR NEW MANAGER,
BECAUSE I QUIT!

07:00.488 --> 07:02.723
- OKAY...
- OH...

07:02.823 --> 07:05.325
- GUYS!

07:05.493 --> 07:08.496
- HE DID SAY TO GO OUT
AND FIND A NEW MANAGER.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.498
- NOT THE WAY
YOU'RE THINKING IT!

07:12.966 --> 07:16.036
- HEY, KATIE, I GOT TO TAKE OUT
A WASPS' NEST.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.204
DO YOU WANT TO SHOOT OFF A CAN?

07:17.304 --> 07:18.539
THIS STUFF SPRAYS, LIKE,
30 FEET.

[canister hissing]

07:19.640 --> 07:21.975

07:22.075 --> 07:25.212
- NO, THANKS.
I'M ABOUT TO MEET MY FUTURE BFF.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.614
AND NO OFFENSE,
BUT IT'S TIME FOR ME

07:26.714 --> 07:28.982
TO START HANGING OUT WITH GIRLS
AND TALK ABOUT BOYS,

07:29.082 --> 07:30.383
NOT WASPS.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.620
- OH.
WELL, OKAY.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.655
I'LL SEE YOU LATER,
I GUESS.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.625

08:19.432 --> 08:21.368
- I JUST DO NOT THINK
WE NEED A NEW MANAGER.

08:21.468 --> 08:22.870
- ALAN SHARP WAS THE FORCE

08:22.970 --> 08:24.738
BEHIND AMERICA'S
GREATEST BOY BANDS,

08:24.838 --> 08:27.374
FROM NEW KIDS
TO BACKSTREET TO 'NSYNC.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.009
- WE DON'T NEED HELP.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.580
I AM PREPARED TO FIGHT
THIS INVASION ON MY OWN.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.681
- IS THAT A TEN STRAW?

08:33.781 --> 08:35.048
- TRY 12.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.150
- OKAY, WE WILL MEET WITH HIM.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.688
BUT REMEMBER,
THIS IS NOT A REAL INVASION.

08:40.788 --> 08:41.755
slam!

08:41.855 --> 08:44.024
- GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS AN INVASION,

08:44.124 --> 08:45.926
AND IT IS REAL.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.396
THESE BRITISH BOY BANDS ARE
LIKE A HOT BOY BOMB,

08:49.496 --> 08:51.699
AND THEY'RE COMING
TO BLOW YOU OFF THE MAP

08:51.799 --> 08:54.835
UNLESS YOU GOT
