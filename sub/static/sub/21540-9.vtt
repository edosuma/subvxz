That apartment needs

People don't care
about our friendship.

00:10.243 --> 00:12.178
- Are you happy with
who you're with now?

00:12.212 --> 00:14.114
- It's been a long history.

00:14.147 --> 00:17.250
- The biggest two-bedroom
is gonna be the D and the E,

00:17.283 --> 00:18.885
which is the three-bed
combination.

00:18.918 --> 00:22.455
- It would work perfect,
so let's do it.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.391
- Yes! Yes!

00:26.726 --> 00:29.262

<i>No boundaries, no limits,</i>

00:53.520 --> 00:55.221
I didn't steal your clients,
they came to me.

00:55.255 --> 00:57.123
- I worked really damn hard
to get here.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.059
I'm not gonna have
somebody like you steal from me.

SoHo,

A really nice,

Jason Lee and Johnny Wan

Which is a powerhouse

01:37.864 --> 01:39.265
So what's going on,
first?

01:39.299 --> 01:41.968
- So we had the broker, um,

01:42.002 --> 01:45.605
didn't have too much activity.
- Oh.

01:45.638 --> 01:47.340
I know who
they're talking about.

01:47.374 --> 01:50.010
<i>I know the building.</i>
<i>-</i>So we decided

01:50.110 --> 01:52.345
to take it off the market,
and called you in.

01:52.379 --> 01:53.480
- Great.

01:53.513 --> 01:57.417
And that other broker
is Fredrik Eklund.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.486
<i>He had it on the market</i>
<i>for over four months.</i>

01:59.519 --> 02:02.956
None of the units sold,

<i>The bottom.</i>

02:20.440 --> 02:21.941
How big are these ceilings?

02:21.975 --> 02:24.077
<i>- They are 14-foot plus.</i>

02:24.110 --> 02:27.414
<i>- There's a three-bedroom</i>
<i>duplex penthouse at the top.</i>

02:27.447 --> 02:30.316
<i>* *</i>

02:30.350 --> 02:32.786
<i>And the middle</i>
<i>is separated between</i>

02:32.819 --> 02:38.158
<i>two three-bedroom duplexes,</i>
<i>one of which is staged.</i>

Ah-ha.

- The whole house is controlled
with these iPads on the walls.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.406
Like, we can raise the shades.
- Whoa.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.575
And there's a rain sensor
outside every window,

02:55.608 --> 02:57.577
so if it rains,
it'll automatically close.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.379
- That's insane.

02:59.412 --> 03:02.349
<i>I've never seen apartments</i>
<i>that are this tricked out.</i>

03:02.382 --> 03:04.718
<i>There are speakers that</i>
<i>drop down from the ceiling.</i>

03:04.751 --> 03:06.853
- The TV's actually on
a motorized stand.

03:06.886 --> 03:10.757
And the closets are also lit up,
so when you open them,

03:10.790 --> 03:11.858
they're lighted up.
- Ooh.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.493
<i>These places</i>
<i>are bananas crazy.</i>

<i>I can't, for the life of me,</i>
<i>figure out</i>

03:14.894 --> 03:16.730
how Fredrik
couldn't sell them.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.598
Maybe he couldn't figure out
how to turn them all on.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.500

<i>* *</i>

03:23.503 --> 03:25.638
This place is ridiculous,

03:25.672 --> 03:28.441
but it definitely has
some issues.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.211
It's a great, great space,
but it's also dark.

03:31.244 --> 03:32.412
You only have two windows,

03:32.445 --> 03:35.315
and then you stain the floors
a dark color

03:35.348 --> 03:37.784
and you stain
these beautiful wood panels

03:37.817 --> 03:39.486
dark brown?

03:39.519 --> 03:40.754
- We were told
it would sell.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.555
Whoever told you that
is an ass****.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.190
- That was our broker.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.226
<i>- What is it with Fredrik</i>
<i>and dark floors?</i>

03:46.259 --> 03:50.096
- The obvious here,
of course, is dark.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.332
- It's very, very,
very 1990s.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.200
- He was against the dark brown.
- I was against it.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.769
We should have
something lighter.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.437
- Like downstairs
at the townhouse.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.938
- Those are going
to look like this

03:58.972 --> 04:00.540
when they're done.
- Okay, so stop.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.609
Just tell your guys,
"Guys, go home."

04:02.642 --> 04:04.277
They should not do this.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.545
All the furniture
has to come out.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.080
There's no color in here.

04:07.113 --> 04:10.116
- There's just so much work
that we put into them.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.052
And now you're telling us
to just lose money.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.521
- You guys have been given
in the absolute wrong direction.

04:14.554 --> 04:18.224
I think this really is
a disservice to you.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.226
- What kind of price
do you think we can get?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.295
- What's your blend
on the building right now?

04:22.328 --> 04:25.665
- We're supposed to get
2,850.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.534
- A foot?

04:27.567 --> 04:30.503
Across the street, there are
three-bedroom apartments

04:30.537 --> 04:33.873
for $1,000 a square foot less.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.375
We need to
reprice the building

04:35.408 --> 04:38.078
at a blend of $2,500 a foot.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.446
- Say again.
- It's been sitting

04:39.479 --> 04:41.948
on the market.
- Uh--

04:41.981 --> 04:44.317
- Just put on blinders.
We are starting this project

04:44.351 --> 04:46.853
from the beginning.
- But you have to promise us

04:46.886 --> 04:49.823
one thing, though.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.658
No traveling
until you sell all units.

04:51.691 --> 04:55.328
- This is all I do,
22 hours a day.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.529
So I'll be here.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.764
- What do you do
in the other 2 hours?

04:57.797 --> 05:00.066
- I sleep.
- Oh.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.035
If you can hit
those numbers...

05:05.905 --> 05:07.407
Then we have a deal.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.442
- Let's sell the coolest
new condo development

05:09.476 --> 05:10.877
in Tribeca.
- Awesome.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.046
- Yes!
I got it!

05:13.046 --> 05:15.081
<i>Do I get enjoyment</i>
<i>from taking a listing over</i>

05:15.115 --> 05:17.050
that Fredrik couldn't sell?

05:17.083 --> 05:18.585
Yes.
Shouldn't the apartment,

05:18.618 --> 05:20.053
like, automatically know
that we're leaving

05:20.086 --> 05:22.288
<i>and start closing?</i>
<i>- You could set it up that way.</i>

05:36.269 --> 05:37.937
How you doing?
Oh, that looks amazing.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.206

<i>the owner/senior</i>
<i>vice president, Natasha,</i>

05:51.851 --> 05:54.421
<i>because we go way, way back.</i>
- You got the phone call

05:54.454 --> 05:56.189
because we're friends,
but you have to prove to me

05:56.222 --> 05:57.657
that you can sell this place.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.225
- Joe, how you doing?
- Nice, how are you?

05:59.259 --> 06:00.293
- Good to see you.
Good to meet you.

06:00.326 --> 06:01.795
<i>I found out</i>
<i>that some buyers</i>

06:01.828 --> 06:03.496
<i>went into contract</i>
<i>for the eighth floor,</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:05.365
<i>which is seven floors</i>
<i>lower than mine,</i>

06:05.398 --> 06:06.733
<i>for more than</i>
<i>what I'm asking.</i>

06:06.766 --> 06:09.402
Now they have an opportunity
to have the same apartment

06:09.436 --> 06:10.603
on a much higher floor.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.039
<i>But unfortunately,</i>

06:28.888 --> 06:30.557

the art of simplicity.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.095
<i>Simple cocktails,</i>

<i>And actually, most of these</i>
<i>brokers came to me through</i>

07:00.353 --> 07:04.557
my social media posts
about this particular apartment.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.059
Now this apartment
is very special.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.827
It's very Park Avenue, you know?
It's kept that essence.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.162
<i>You know, you have</i>
<i>all the moldings,</i>

07:09.195 --> 07:11.431
<i>you have the French doors,</i>
<i>you have the chandeliers.</i>

07:11.464 --> 07:12.766
It's five bedrooms.
Formal dining room,

07:12.799 --> 07:14.167
media room,
and a huge kitchen.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.269
<i>It's a great layout.</i>
<i>- Look at the light.</i>

07:16.302 --> 07:17.704
<i>- The light just gets</i>
<i>better and better.</i>

07:17.737 --> 07:20.040
The floors below us,
you don't have that.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.574
- Right.
<i>- I am disappointed</i>

07:21.608 --> 07:23.376
<i>that the apartment</i>
<i>downstairs sold,</i>

07:23.410 --> 07:26.846
but I'm actually going
to use that sale

07:26.880 --> 07:28.148
as an advantage.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.119
And we're priced at 10.
- Okay.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.855
- That's a comp
that I can now use in my favor.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.058
The only difference was
that that one was renovated

07:38.058 --> 07:39.693
<i>This one is not</i>
<i>completely renovated.</i>

07:39.726 --> 07:40.727
- It needs some work.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.730
- I think they renovated
about 20 yeas ago.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.765
- Yeah.
- A long, long time ago.

07:45.799 --> 07:46.966
This is the top floor,

07:47.067 --> 07:49.703
which is
a very valuable asset.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.171
- This is cool.
- It's amazing.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.672
- Yeah.
- Gorgeous.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.240
- Very nice.
- It's beautiful.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.875
I feel great
about the open house.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.544
I really do.
Uh, if you guys want to,

07:57.577 --> 07:58.578
uh, treat yourself
for a whiskey.

07:58.611 --> 07:59.813
<i>Enjoy.</i>

07:59.846 --> 08:01.014
<i>But it needs to go</i>
<i>better than that.</i>

08:01.014 --> 08:02.182
It needs to be like,

08:02.215 --> 08:04.384
"I'll call you tomorrow
with an all cash offer."

08:04.417 --> 08:05.618
I may not drink,
but can you save me

08:05.652 --> 08:07.287
a bottle for later?
- Absolutely.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.755

stressful listing

08:26.773 --> 08:29.809

<i>that he might fire me</i>
<i>if I don't sell it immediately.</i>

08:50.096 --> 08:51.097
- We're not waiting any longer.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.234
You get it sold,
or we both move on.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.770
That was before I even knew
another broker

I've been working

09:32.839 --> 09:35.041
on the project
for three years,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.744
but I want to hear
why you think it's okay

09:37.777 --> 09:39.612
for you to call
my developer, my client--

09:39.646 --> 09:42.048
- You know, I'm not interested
in that listing.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.317
That listing,
between me and you,

09:44.351 --> 09:45.652
is overpriced.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.954
I can understand
why your investor,

09:48.054 --> 09:50.123
why your developer
is frustrated.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.958
- I mean, it doesn't help
their frustration

09:52.058 --> 09:54.861
that you,
whomever you are,

09:54.894 --> 09:56.963
calling them,
saying these things to them.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.065
Whispering in their ear
that you can do a better job.

09:59.099 --> 10:03.636
- I called Steve
about future business.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.071
And throughout
the course of conversation,

10:05.105 --> 10:06.773
he brings up to me,
"Well what do you think about

10:06.806 --> 10:09.009
the job that
Fredrik's doing?"

10:11.111 --> 10:13.079
I tell everybody how it is.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.514
- Only you said I'm not doing
a good job.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.282
That's very clever of you.
- You're spread thin.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.617
You're doing too many things.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.386
And if you think
that I'm the only one

10:19.419 --> 10:21.021
that's going after
your clients,

10:21.054 --> 10:22.255
it's the nature of the game.

It's New York City
real estate.

it wasn't done.

I never had a showroom,
I never had anything to show.

that it's just been empty.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.492
People buy things on
a floor plan all the time.

do not buy with floor plans.

11:01.761 --> 11:02.962

They don't buy

they just don't.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.885
- Douglas Elliman.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.588

I'm allowed to do that.

- You don't own this client

11:44.137 --> 11:45.839
- You're doing it the wrong way.
- It's competitive.

say that to me again.

- Amazing.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.769
- And this is the smallest
of the three terraces.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.704
- Wow, it's spectacular.
- Oh, my God.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.206
This is insane.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.142
A 1,700 square foot master.
- Oh.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.410
- That's bigger than most--
- I have never seen

16:50.443 --> 16:51.745
anything like this before.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.214
- Well, wait.
I saved the best part.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.416
Follow me,
let's go to the garage.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.385
- [gasps]
- Oh, my God.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.886

<i>So I need to go big</i>
<i>and be memorable.</i>

17:06.593 --> 17:09.396
- Damn, that's gorgeous.
- Staging is very important.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.864
You have an empty apartment
you're trying to sell,

17:10.897 --> 17:12.265
you put in furniture.

17:12.298 --> 17:15.035
How do you sell a garage?
- Ooh, that car.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.036
Bing.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.637
<i>I'm sparing no expense.</i>

17:17.671 --> 17:19.873
Doesn't matter
what the car costs to rent.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.675
I like that you have
private parking,

17:21.708 --> 17:23.076
and the only thing
we're charging

17:23.109 --> 17:26.746
is $550,000 extra.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.215
- This space doesn't
come with the apartment?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.651
- Well we reserved it
for the penthouse buyer,

17:31.685 --> 17:35.121
but it's $550,000--
- So at $30 million,

17:35.155 --> 17:37.924
we're not getting
cinderblocks included?

17:37.957 --> 17:39.726
- We've had many,
many offers at full ask.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.194
We reserve it
for the penthouse.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.595
When you resell it later,

17:42.629 --> 17:44.597
you can add a million dollars
on the price.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.099
- We'll definitely
talk about this later.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.567
Okay.
- Oh, well, let's--let's

17:47.600 --> 17:49.069
talk it over, okay?

17:49.069 --> 17:51.771
- Just a few years ago,
the first thing

17:51.805 --> 17:53.840
that would always
sell in a building

17:53.873 --> 17:55.442
was always the penthouses.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.811
Now it's completely 180.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.479
- We'll see.
- Without any offers,

17:59.512 --> 18:02.015
I don't know how long I'm going
to last on this listing.

18:02.015 --> 18:03.883
- Does the car come
with the apartment?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.118
- No.
- Do you come

18:05.151 --> 18:07.020
with the apartment?

18:07.053 --> 18:08.722
- Me?

18:08.755 --> 18:12.225
I'm--I'm married.
- Oh.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.761
- It's a little warm in here.

You're so sweet.

18:48.061 --> 18:49.963
What's going on
with the apartment?

18:50.063 --> 18:51.631
- Yes.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.067
Actually,
there's bad news.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.902
- You've called me here
to give me bad news?

18:55.935 --> 18:59.072
- We're not getting
any offers.

18:59.072 --> 19:03.209
And I may not be
the right agent for you.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.812
- I don't understand
what's going on.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.485
- I got a full ask offer
at $10 million.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.586
- For real?
- Yes, yeah.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.688
- So you're just
messing with me.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.289
You have a full ask offer.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.591
- I have a full ask offer
at $10 million

19:18.625 --> 19:20.727
from a very,
very legitimate buyer.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.662
- Great job, Luis.
I'm so excited.

19:22.696 --> 19:23.830
Whoo!

19:23.863 --> 19:25.899
- I got you.
[squeals]

19:25.932 --> 19:28.435
Love it!
[slaps legs]

19:28.468 --> 19:30.270
You know how much
you've made me suffer?

19:30.303 --> 19:31.604
In 2008.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.239
So I was trying to do
the same to you.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.542
- This is great news,
but you do know now we have to

19:35.575 --> 19:37.744
go through the board.
- Yes, the board.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.145
<i>For New York City co-ops,</i>

19:39.179 --> 19:42.849
it doesn't matter if you have
a full ask offer or not.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.319
Every buyer needs to go through
a board approval process.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.554
And that's non negotiable.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.389
What I like about this client,
is that this is

19:49.422 --> 19:51.791
the kind of client that is up to
the board's standards.

19:51.825 --> 19:54.527
She is, um, single mother.
- Mm-hmm.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.895
- Makes a lot of money,
is an executive.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.130
- Okay. Is it cash?
- She already--

19:57.163 --> 19:58.932
It's in financing,
but she already lives

19:58.965 --> 20:01.234
in a co-op on Park Avenue.
- Okay, so she understands

20:01.267 --> 20:02.736
how it works.
- She understands how that is,

20:02.769 --> 20:04.637
and she is co-op material.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.340
Every buyer has to submit
a board application package.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.276
Now that board application
package is about 50 pages.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.579
And you have to include
financial statements,

20:12.612 --> 20:13.847
letter of employment.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.484
You can be Bill Gates
married to Warren Buffett,

20:17.517 --> 20:19.419
having a son
with Mark Zuckerberg,

20:19.452 --> 20:22.722
and all that wealth together,
it does not matter.

20:22.756 --> 20:25.158
I think she's good.
- You think or you know?

20:25.191 --> 20:27.560
- I know.
She does have a pet,

20:27.594 --> 20:29.295
but it's, um--
- A pet? Is it a dog

20:29.329 --> 20:30.296
or is it a--
- It's a dog.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.297
- A horse.
- It's not a--

20:31.331 --> 20:32.565
it's not a horse.
- [laughs]

20:32.599 --> 20:34.234
I think
it's about 28 pounds.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.602
- We just need to make sure
everything--

20:35.635 --> 20:38.405
all the Is are dotted,
all the Ts are crossed.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.106
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

20:40.140 --> 20:42.042
- Can you stay, please,
for some lunch?

20:42.075 --> 20:43.410
- Yeah, let's at least
catch up a little bit.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.744
- No, but right now.
Can you stay?

20:44.778 --> 20:46.246
- Right now?
- Yes.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.847

- So this is a date, now.
- Uh, no.

a thousand people?

22:03.456 --> 22:04.858
That's a sh**load of people.

There's four units,

22:33.853 --> 22:34.888

the windows will

22:56.843 --> 22:57.911
This is the walk-in closet.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.679

The speakers pop down

23:01.781 --> 23:02.949

23:03.049 --> 23:05.585
so that the sound
always watches where you go.

23:05.618 --> 23:08.321

actually has a brain.

Didn't this many people

- Not as many, I would say.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.440
- No?
- It's a good turnout,

23:27.474 --> 23:29.409
but I don't know how many
of those are real buyers.

23:33.146 --> 23:36.282
- Don't be so nervous.
We're going to sell it.

23:36.316 --> 23:38.351
I will, no--
I will get you an offer.

- It's too low.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.172
- That's why we're here.
We're going to talk it out.

25:06.206 --> 25:07.874
'Cause there's got to be
somewhere between 25 and 30.

to lower the price.

- But you got to counter.

25:13.613 --> 25:14.647

that apartment.

It's $30 million
or I'm not interested.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.193
- I know for a fact they're not
going to go the full ask,

25:27.227 --> 25:28.795
so let's not even
begin there, right?

25:28.828 --> 25:29.896
- So there's actually
something I've been

25:29.929 --> 25:31.297
thinking about
for a while.

25:31.331 --> 25:34.267
Um, I was in the apartment
over the weekend,

25:34.300 --> 25:36.803
and I was just staring
at the--the--the ceiling height,

25:36.836 --> 25:38.772
like, the apartment's
beautiful, right?

25:38.805 --> 25:40.240
- It's gorgeous.
- And, you know,

25:40.273 --> 25:42.876
in a year, year and a half,
that unit could be worth

25:42.909 --> 25:44.744
$35, $40 million,
and I can't let

25:44.778 --> 25:47.647
the opportunity
just get lost.

25:47.681 --> 25:48.948
Here's what I'm saying.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.985
If you can't get to 30,
I'd rather buy it than--

25:52.085 --> 25:54.087
than see it go for any less.

25:57.090 --> 26:01.027
- And I have you
as an exclusion in my agreement.

26:01.027 --> 26:03.029
Whoa.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.331
I guess I don't get
a commission.

33:23.737 --> 33:24.838
That's f***ing awesome.

33:27.974 --> 33:29.509
I know it's lower
than you want,

33:29.542 --> 33:32.879
but there's so much
competition.

33:32.912 --> 33:34.881
<i>Yes, these apartments</i>
<i>are beautiful,</i>

33:34.914 --> 33:36.282
<i>but it's supply and demand.</i>

33:36.316 --> 33:40.387
And a lot of that competition
has a lot of amenities.

33:40.420 --> 33:44.224
Full service buildings with play
rooms and doggie spas.

33:44.257 --> 33:47.861
- Don't give me a line of sh**
out of your mouth.

33:47.894 --> 33:48.895
- I'm not giving you
a line of sh**.

33:48.928 --> 33:49.896
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying

33:49.929 --> 33:52.499
that there's competition.

33:52.532 --> 33:53.633
So why don't we
do this, then?

33:53.667 --> 33:54.768
Why don't we do this?
Let's take it

33:54.801 --> 33:56.369
one step at a time.

33:56.403 --> 33:58.638
Third floor,
it's a tricky unit.

33:58.672 --> 34:01.775
Low floor.
It's only got two windows.

34:01.808 --> 34:03.643
What we need is momentum.

34:03.677 --> 34:06.713
We need to put one in contract,
because people,

34:06.746 --> 34:09.949
for the other three,
need to be attracted

34:10.050 --> 34:14.287
to a building that other people
want to be in.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.256
There are a lot of people
who don't want to be

34:16.289 --> 34:18.558
the first buyer
in a boutique building,

34:18.591 --> 34:21.327
<i>'cause you're sharing</i>
<i>everything with just a few</i>

34:21.361 --> 34:23.763
<i>other home owners,</i>
<i>and you kind of want to know</i>

34:23.797 --> 34:25.498
who your neighbors
are going to be.

34:25.532 --> 34:27.567
If one of them doesn't sell
right away,

34:27.600 --> 34:29.769
they're not going to sell,
they're gonna sit.

34:29.803 --> 34:30.970
And then all four
are going to sit.

34:32.439 --> 34:33.707
I--I can't.

34:33.740 --> 34:35.075
I've already done that.

34:35.075 --> 34:36.810
I've already done that work,
'cause I got them

34:36.843 --> 34:37.811
when they were about
to pull the trigger

34:37.844 --> 34:38.978
on something else.

34:39.079 --> 34:40.280
So if it's not us,
they're going to

34:40.313 --> 34:41.748
a loft in SoHo.

34:46.519 --> 34:48.988
- I agree you need to get
the momentum of sales going

34:49.089 --> 34:50.623
for the building.

34:50.657 --> 34:52.092
Let's make that deal.

34:52.092 --> 34:55.195
- Holy sh** we sold one.

34:55.228 --> 34:59.265
This is possibly the greatest
date I've ever gone on.

34:59.299 --> 35:01.401
- Good. We'll do it.
- Both of them?

35:01.434 --> 35:03.269
- No, on the third floor.

35:06.373 --> 35:07.707
No way under the sun.

35:07.741 --> 35:11.044
That's like the worst offer
I've ever seen.

35:11.044 --> 35:13.279
- I disagree, but okay.
- I think you should have

35:13.313 --> 35:15.048
another party
for the penthouse.

35:15.081 --> 35:16.149
- I just ha--
what are you talking about?

35:16.182 --> 35:17.283
I just had a party.
- Yeah, you should

35:17.317 --> 35:18.284
have another party
for the penthouse.

35:18.318 --> 35:19.452
- No, no, no.
I just had a party.

35:19.486 --> 35:21.154
and I had a thousand people
through the penthouse.

35:21.187 --> 35:22.422
Everybody saw it.
That's why I just

35:22.455 --> 35:23.656
got you this offer.
- If you have an offer

35:23.690 --> 35:25.592
of 7.5 with that party,
then throw a bigger party

35:25.625 --> 35:28.161
maybe you'll get a bigger offer
for the penthouse.

35:28.194 --> 35:30.230
<i>- I can push back a bit,</i>

35:30.263 --> 35:33.066
but ultimately, I have to do
what Jason wants.

35:33.099 --> 35:35.268
<i>But if he walks away</i>
<i>from this number right now,</i>

35:35.301 --> 35:36.936
<i>and then the building</i>
<i>sits again,</i>

35:36.970 --> 35:38.405
then it's over.

35:38.438 --> 35:41.207
And there is no
coming back from that.

35:41.241 --> 35:42.776
- Listen,
I'll do another party.

35:42.809 --> 35:43.777
I don't know what
I'm going to do

35:43.810 --> 35:45.078
I'm going to have to
figure it out.

35:45.078 --> 35:46.646
- But don't come to me
with another lowball,

35:46.680 --> 35:49.382
like, stupid offer.

35:49.416 --> 35:50.984
It's, like, embarrassing.

35:51.084 --> 35:53.787
We're on the same page
on that, right?

35:53.820 --> 35:56.423
- This development
has been in the press.

35:56.456 --> 35:58.091
<i>A lot.</i>
<i>And so now I've got</i>

35:58.124 --> 36:00.393
all these eyes
looking at me.

36:00.427 --> 36:01.795
- You got to really
sell this deal.

36:01.828 --> 36:05.131
- And the last thing I need
is an article about me

36:05.165 --> 36:08.568
saying, "Ryan Serhant couldn't
sell this building either."

36:08.601 --> 36:12.472
I mean, if I don't perform,
then--then--

36:12.505 --> 36:14.274
I mean,
it's complete failure.

36:14.307 --> 36:15.742
- You will never come to me

36:15.775 --> 36:18.311
with this conversation again.
- Okay.

36:21.114 --> 36:24.084
<i>[contemplative music]</i>

36:24.117 --> 36:32.125
<i>* *</i>

36:33.126 --> 36:34.794
- Here we are again.

36:34.828 --> 36:36.129
<i>A few weeks back,</i>

36:36.162 --> 36:38.298
<i>we implanted three embryos</i>

36:38.331 --> 36:39.899
for our second round of IVF.

36:42.869 --> 36:44.070
Let's see, let's see.

36:44.070 --> 36:46.106
let the universe decide
what it's going to be.

36:46.139 --> 36:49.175
And now it's time to get an
update how everything is going

36:49.209 --> 36:50.710
with our surrogates.

36:50.744 --> 36:52.278
- Fredrik? Derek?
I'll see you now.

36:52.312 --> 36:53.446
- Hi, hi.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.682
Last time we were in
<i>this situation,</i>

36:55.715 --> 36:57.350
we got bad news.

36:57.384 --> 36:58.752
- Wasn't meant to happen now.

36:58.785 --> 37:00.720
I mean, things happen
for a reason.

37:00.754 --> 37:03.256
- But I can feel.
I know that this time

37:03.289 --> 37:05.892
it's gonna be
good news.

37:05.925 --> 37:08.261
- Well we've done
two journeys now.

37:08.294 --> 37:11.498
We've made
two separate efforts.

37:11.531 --> 37:15.335
And neither one of them
has worked.

37:15.368 --> 37:17.037
In some situations,
I'm so sorry,

37:17.037 --> 37:20.473
including yours,
we just haven't succeeded yet.

37:20.507 --> 37:22.275
And that's really tough.

37:29.115 --> 37:31.317
- I mean, shouldn't something
have happened by now?

37:31.351 --> 37:32.385
- Yes.
- Shouldn't we have

37:32.419 --> 37:33.386
had a hit?
- There's no question.

37:33.420 --> 37:34.788
You guys are really healthy.

37:34.821 --> 37:36.356
Your sperm is great.

37:36.389 --> 37:38.658
Your surrogate is ideal.

37:38.692 --> 37:40.827
The only thing left
is to try with

37:40.860 --> 37:42.462
a different egg donor.

37:42.495 --> 37:44.330
<i>- All the people</i>
<i>with kids out there.</i>

37:44.364 --> 37:46.533
They're so blessed.

37:46.566 --> 37:48.835
I really envy that.

37:48.868 --> 37:50.503
I mean,
I know it's common,

37:50.537 --> 37:52.439
I know it's normal, maybe,
I don't know.

37:52.472 --> 37:55.809
I just feel helpless.

37:55.842 --> 37:58.078
At some point, you know,
you just wonder

37:58.111 --> 38:00.880
if it's--what are you doing to--
what are we doing to ourselves?

38:00.914 --> 38:02.115
You know?
- I know it hasn't

38:02.148 --> 38:03.750
played out yet, for you.

38:03.783 --> 38:05.585
And so I can understand
why you'd be hesitant

38:05.618 --> 38:07.821
to just re-up for that,
but Fredrik,

38:07.854 --> 38:09.055
that's what you need to do.

38:09.089 --> 38:10.490
- Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

38:10.523 --> 38:13.059
- But--
- I honestly don't know.

38:13.093 --> 38:15.528
When do you actually say,

38:15.562 --> 38:17.897
"I tried, I really tried.
I did my best."

38:17.931 --> 38:19.466
<i>When do you--</i>
<i>when do you just, like,</i>

38:19.499 --> 38:22.235
go and say,

38:22.268 --> 38:23.703
"It's not going to happen."

38:23.737 --> 38:26.706
- I'm actually really confident.
- How can you be confident?

38:26.740 --> 38:28.708
I mean, you're saying
that we should

38:28.742 --> 38:30.777
have had success by now.
- I mean, I--I have

38:30.810 --> 38:33.279
my son Matt,
after our seventh try.

38:33.313 --> 38:35.348
- That's a journey,
and it's been like this

38:35.382 --> 38:36.616
from day one.

38:36.649 --> 38:38.118
It's an unpredictable journey.

38:38.151 --> 38:40.387
And that's just
how it's meant to be.

38:40.420 --> 38:42.956
Can't change that.
- It's not supposed to be

38:43.056 --> 38:44.391
like this.

38:44.424 --> 38:46.860
<i>I refuse to say that</i>
<i>life is about pain,</i>

38:46.893 --> 38:48.928
<i>and--and sadness</i>
<i>and death.</i>

38:48.962 --> 38:50.663
It really isn't
supposed to be like this.

38:50.697 --> 38:53.066
- So we just got to
keep trying.

38:53.066 --> 38:55.602
There's no point
in giving up.

38:55.635 --> 38:57.537
- I have to, um,
get back to work.

38:57.570 --> 38:59.072
I never thought
I was going to say it,

38:59.072 --> 39:01.574
but I'll say it.

39:01.608 --> 39:06.079
I think I'm done.

39:06.112 --> 39:09.249
I will get back
into the saddle at work.

39:09.282 --> 39:12.619
<i>I'm not going to allow myself</i>
<i>to be a mess like this.</i>

39:12.652 --> 39:15.088
<i>I don't even want to see</i>
<i>pictures of babies.</i>

39:15.121 --> 39:17.524
I don't want to--

39:17.557 --> 39:19.359
I just want to
stay away from everything.

39:19.392 --> 39:21.428
<i>Forget about it.</i>
<i>Forget about the whole thing.</i>

39:21.461 --> 39:22.529
- Thank you.
- All right.

39:22.562 --> 39:24.664
- I'm not going to,
uh, overstep

39:30.804 --> 39:31.171
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

39:33.740 --> 39:36.710
<i>* *</i>

39:36.743 --> 39:38.378
- Hello
- Hello, how's it going?

39:38.411 --> 39:39.646
- How are you, very good.
- Good.

39:39.679 --> 39:40.847
Good to see you.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.916
- The board interview
went amazing.

39:42.949 --> 39:44.918
I'm kind of surprised.

39:44.951 --> 39:46.720
They had no problem
with the dog being

39:46.753 --> 39:49.255
a little bit overweight.
So--

39:49.289 --> 39:50.957
But yesterday,
something happened

39:51.057 --> 39:53.093
that was much worse
than a fat dog.

39:53.126 --> 39:54.961
You know how much I respect you,
which is the reason I came here.

39:55.061 --> 39:55.962
- Mm-hmm
- And I'm afraid I don't

39:56.062 --> 39:58.098
have good news.
- Luis, again.

39:58.131 --> 40:00.767
- The deal fell through.
- Okay.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.736
- Wow, she thinks I'm joking.

40:02.769 --> 40:03.937
Only this time,
I'm not.

40:03.970 --> 40:05.038
But this is really
what happened.

40:05.071 --> 40:06.973
- All right, mm-hmm.
- You know.

40:07.007 --> 40:09.442
I shouldn't even have joked
in the first time.

40:09.476 --> 40:12.579
- Gimme some good news.
- I don't have good news.

40:12.612 --> 40:14.247
This is the truth.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.082
Listen, let me--
just let me just explain.

40:16.116 --> 40:17.250
The buyer really
wants the apartment,

40:17.283 --> 40:18.518
still wants the apartment.
- Mm-hmm.

40:18.551 --> 40:20.954
- Uh, very qualified,
but unfortunately,

40:20.987 --> 40:23.490
70% of her net worth
was on one specific stock,

40:23.523 --> 40:24.791
which was her company stock.

40:24.824 --> 40:28.762
And this company stock
went from 27 to 13 overnight.

40:28.795 --> 40:30.563
This is something
that nobody saw coming.

40:30.597 --> 40:32.065
Not even her.

40:32.098 --> 40:35.802
This is what happens
in this business.

40:35.835 --> 40:39.973
You work tirelessly
to put a deal together.

40:40.006 --> 40:41.374
<i>When a deal falls through,</i>

40:41.408 --> 40:43.710
everything you did--

40:43.743 --> 40:45.311
Gone.

40:45.345 --> 40:46.646
It just happens,
it's real estate.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.982
- Luis, this is the second
client that fell through.

40:49.015 --> 40:50.016
- I know.
- Obviously you're not

40:50.050 --> 40:51.851
honing in on
the correct clientele.

40:51.885 --> 40:53.520
- Well, I don't--
I don't think

40:53.553 --> 40:54.854
that's actually true,
because this person

40:54.888 --> 40:58.224
that we just had,
was an excellent client.

40:58.258 --> 41:00.593
This is not my fault.
- It's not your fault?

41:00.627 --> 41:02.095
- It's not my fault.
- You should have had

41:02.128 --> 41:03.663
a backup plan.
- I still show it.

41:03.697 --> 41:05.265
I do two open houses
every week.

41:05.298 --> 41:06.266
- Right, but you have
no backup plan?

41:06.299 --> 41:07.600
You have no other clients?

41:07.634 --> 41:08.902
- Well I have--I have--
I'm calling other people.

41:08.935 --> 41:11.071
- Time is money,
and you're wasting my time.

41:11.071 --> 41:12.238
- I--I understand that.

41:12.272 --> 41:14.407
[sighs]

41:14.441 --> 41:17.410
<i>I really, really, really</i>
<i>want to put this deal together.</i>

41:17.444 --> 41:18.812
<i>And this is just</i>

41:18.845 --> 41:21.948
frustrating,
because there are things

41:21.981 --> 41:23.950
that I can't control.

41:23.983 --> 41:27.587
- I need a client that will
close on this apartment.

41:27.620 --> 41:28.755
- I know. I know.

41:28.788 --> 41:30.256
And I'm her because
I want to tell you

41:30.290 --> 41:32.525
that I want to continue
to work with you

41:32.559 --> 41:34.227
until I finish this.

41:34.260 --> 41:36.696
And I will deliver, listen,
I am--I am very close.

41:36.730 --> 41:39.132
- I don't need to hear
your whole song and dance, here.

41:39.165 --> 41:41.668
When I don't see results,
I can't sit here with you

41:41.701 --> 41:45.005
on the listing anymore.

41:45.105 --> 41:47.640
<i>- I'm going to get fired,</i>
<i>I know it.</i>

41:47.674 --> 41:48.675
Doesn't matter what you do.

41:48.708 --> 41:50.210
If the deal doesn't
get done,

41:50.243 --> 41:51.511
nothing really happens.

41:51.544 --> 41:53.313
You did nothing.

41:53.346 --> 41:56.449
- Listen, I've known you
for years.

41:56.483 --> 41:58.418
Thank you for everything
you've done so far.

42:03.556 --> 42:05.959
[sighs]
I'll give you three months.

42:06.059 --> 42:08.361
You either sell it,
or that's it.

42:10.330 --> 42:11.865
I trust you,
and in this business,

42:11.898 --> 42:14.067
trust is before anything else.

42:14.067 --> 42:15.702
And I know that you
have it in you

42:15.735 --> 42:17.270
to sell this apartment.

42:17.303 --> 42:18.705
- All right.
Reset.

42:18.738 --> 42:21.841
Back to one.

42:21.875 --> 42:23.243
New lease on life.

42:23.276 --> 42:25.412
Always good to see you, Natasha.
- Thank you, you too.

42:25.445 --> 42:27.847
- [laughs]
- No more excuses, Luis.

42:27.881 --> 42:29.282
<i>- There was no excuses.</i>
<i>There was reasons!</i>

42:29.315 --> 42:31.317
<i>- Let's go!</i>

42:32.686 --> 42:35.255
<i>- Next on "Million Dollar</i>
<i>Listing New York"...</i>

42:35.288 --> 42:38.124
- Oh, my God.

42:38.158 --> 42:40.694
[gasps]
This is insanity.

42:40.727 --> 42:43.630
- I'm doing everything I can.
- Maybe not everything.

42:43.663 --> 42:45.165
- If they're willing to
fire one person,

42:45.198 --> 42:47.233
they're willing to
fire you too.

42:47.267 --> 42:48.768
- I have nightmares
about this building.

42:48.802 --> 42:49.836
- I don't have--
I don't have the--

42:49.869 --> 42:51.104
I don't have the, uh,
the phone numbers.

42:51.137 --> 42:52.439
Sometimes you don't
put them in,

42:52.472 --> 42:53.873
and then I'm stuck in--
- Why are you in a bad mood?

42:53.907 --> 42:56.109
- I don't--
I cannot think correctly.

42:56.109 --> 42:57.344
I don't know--I--
this is a problem.

42:57.377 --> 42:58.878
I don't know--I don't--
I can't describe.

43:00.480 --> 43:01.548
