of lives beyond measure.

00:09.833 --> 00:13.000
XAVIER: Do not fear, Lilandra.
The X-Men will do all in our
power

00:13.000 --> 00:15.083
to help you safeguard the
crystal.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.125

The M'Kraan Crystal.
Name your price!

00:33.583 --> 00:35.333
Show me the crystal!

-Thank you, Rogue.
-I enjoyed it.

I do not understand.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.583
What is happening?

03:04.583 --> 03:07.708
D'Ken has been granted his
wish. He is one with
the crystal.

03:07.708 --> 03:11.583
He is creating his own universe
inside the crystal,

03:11.583 --> 03:14.166
where we all will soon be.

03:14.166 --> 03:17.583
Ch'od, get the Starjammer
out of here. Now!

03:17.583 --> 03:19.708
What is wrong, Captain?

03:19.708 --> 03:21.583
We are ready to
board the Imperial cruiser
and retrieve you.

03:21.583 --> 03:25.708
No! Full escape velocity
immediately.
That's an order.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.333
You must join them.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.458
I need time to see if the
power of the Phoenix can
contain the crystal.

03:35.500 --> 03:40.125
But if it cannot, then nothing
in the galaxy can
protect any of us.

03:40.125 --> 03:41.625
What can we do?

03:41.625 --> 03:44.875
Nothing. It is what I must do.

04:07.875 --> 04:09.708
Corsair! What is happening?

04:09.708 --> 04:13.000
We are being given
a short time to consider
our fate

04:13.000 --> 04:14.875
while someone attempts
to change it.

04:29.708 --> 04:34.958
I must learn.
The crystal must be healed.

04:34.958 --> 04:36.458
Can you show us what's
happening?

04:36.458 --> 04:38.333
Ch'od, full magnification.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.750
That is all we can do.
Soon, we will be out of range.

-She might still...
-Look!

we're next.

fading away!

06:38.583 --> 06:40.500
I know, Jubilee.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.958
We have discovered
a phenomenon much
like a black hole,

06:43.958 --> 06:47.375
an enormous gravitational force
near the sun.

06:47.375 --> 06:50.458
We must assume
it is the M'Kraan Crystal.

06:50.458 --> 06:55.166
It is slowly drawing everything
into it,
even the sun's light.

06:55.166 --> 06:58.083
Soon, it will absorb the sun
itself,

06:58.083 --> 07:01.875
the entire solar system
including the Earth.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.708
The rest of the galaxy
may well follow,

though, by that time, we shall
have long since ceased to care.

There's gotta be some way
to stop it!

that my service to you must
begin under such circumstances.

17:32.708 --> 17:35.375
The power of the crystal
has been contained.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.416
But at what cost?

17:39.416 --> 17:42.125
PHOENIX: The crystal is sealed,

17:42.125 --> 17:45.708
but the only way to guarantee
that its power
will never be released again

17:45.708 --> 17:49.583
is for me to take it
beyond the reach
of any living being.

17:49.583 --> 17:53.208
The crystal cannot
be destroyed,
even in the heart of the sun,

17:53.208 --> 17:56.083
but there it,
and I, will be safe.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.250
For this, I am sorry, Cyclops.

-Stay with us, Lilandra.
-I am Shi'ar Empress now.

all the wrong my brother did.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.333
Come with me, Charles.

18:56.458 --> 19:02.333
Until there is peace between

I cannot leave.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.250
We both have our work to do.

19:11.333 --> 19:14.458
I'm sorry I tried to use you
against the Emperor, Cyclops.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.708
Since I lost my wife,
I've lived only for my revenge.

19:17.708 --> 19:21.000
None of us know how we'll react
when we lose someone we love.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.833
I'll have to find
a new reason for living now.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.625
So will I.

19:25.625 --> 19:29.875
I'm proud to have known you
and the X-Men. Farewell.

19:29.875 --> 19:35.166
I've lost Jean,

I wish we had a chance to talk.

19:35.166 --> 19:38.208
I believe Emily Dickinson
said it best,

"Parting is all we know
of heaven
And all we need of hell"

19:42.625 --> 19:46.708
There are some bonds
that cannot be broken,
Charles Xavier.

19:46.708 --> 19:48.000
We shall meet again.

Jean.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.458
XAVIER: Do you know
the legend of the Phoenix?

20:08.458 --> 20:11.333
I'm not interested
in legends right now.

20:11.333 --> 20:17.166
The Phoenix was a mythical bird
that was consumed by fire,

20:17.166 --> 20:21.000
but always rose again
from the ashes.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.333
Perhaps that's what
the Phoenix represents,

20:24.333 --> 20:26.583
hope which never dies.

20:28.208 --> 20:31.375
Please think about it, Cyclops.

Jean.
