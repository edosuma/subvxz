WEBVTT

00:11.005 --> 00:15.005
Where is my money? Where are my weapons?
You can’t have both.

00:16.005 --> 00:18.805
You go near my wife
and your life will be over.

00:21.045 --> 00:24.845
Four days after Davoren Park,
she was murdered with a stolen weapon.

00:24.925 --> 00:27.485
Did you have any 9mm Berettas
in your cache?

00:27.965 --> 00:31.085
- Sir, we’ve located the drone.
- <i>What about the data brick?</i>

00:31.165 --> 00:33.645
-I’m afraid it’s gone, sir.
-How is that possible?

00:33.725 --> 00:35.325
-They’re lying, okay?
-Who’s lying?

00:35.685 --> 00:36.525
Where is it?

00:36.605 --> 00:40.085
If you're accusing Haqqani of hacking
your drone, they would have claimed it.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.245
If you send combat troops
into North Waziristan,

00:42.325 --> 00:44.365
my government will treat that
as an act of invasion.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.045
Jesus Christ.

00:46.125 --> 00:48.405
That’s the ambushed safe house,
isn’t it?

00:49.845 --> 00:51.165
I knew she was a spy.

00:51.245 --> 00:54.325
There’s a 20-year sentence
for leaking classified information.

00:59.565 --> 01:01.765
If you don’t work for the air force,
who do you work for?

01:01.845 --> 01:05.445
So, Pale Horse has been
running kill missions in Pakistan.

01:05.525 --> 01:07.205
That’s why the Americans are here.

01:07.285 --> 01:09.485
Does the data tell us
where the hack originated from?

01:09.565 --> 01:12.285
-The Pakistani secret service.
-Jesus Christ!

01:12.365 --> 01:16.645
-Our priority is to get Markson out alive.
-We need to let the negotiations play out.

01:16.725 --> 01:19.125
Diplomatic options are
a waste of time with these people.

02:07.725 --> 02:10.285
-What?
-I need to see Garrity, in person.

02:11.325 --> 02:14.365
-Okay, Cal, that’s not possible.
-I don’t trust anyone else.

02:14.845 --> 02:17.605
You tell me whatever it is
and I promise I’ll get it to Garrity.

02:17.845 --> 02:21.445
No. Just him. I know you can do it.
Your boss has got leverage.

02:22.765 --> 02:25.805
No one's going to let you near the Prime
Minister after what just happened.

02:26.325 --> 02:27.325
What?

02:27.605 --> 02:30.605
That... the guy. The guy in the house
at Captains Flat.

02:32.365 --> 02:33.525
Cal, did you kill him?

02:36.845 --> 02:38.405
Get me to fucking Garrity.

03:33.565 --> 03:34.525
You wanted to see me?

03:43.245 --> 03:47.885
I’m briefing you in on a job. Sensitive,
compartmented, for now just you and me.

03:48.725 --> 03:49.685
Of course.

03:49.765 --> 03:52.245
We’ve intercepted encrypted social media

03:52.325 --> 03:55.245
between a suspected local agent
and Beijing.

03:56.005 --> 03:58.445
I need you to do full forensics
on the agent’s account.

03:58.725 --> 04:01.005
Is the agent aware
they’re being investigated?

04:25.685 --> 04:28.565
The Haqqani know about the US plans
to infiltrate their territory.

04:28.645 --> 04:31.365
They know about the troop buildup,
the base in Khost.

04:32.965 --> 04:36.565
They want it stopped or Markson’s dead.
We’ve got 72 hours to locate him.

04:36.645 --> 04:38.045
That toxic little troll.

04:38.685 --> 04:41.005
All this grandstanding
about national security

04:41.085 --> 04:43.525
and Bailey’s selling
our secrets to Chinese intelligence.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.245
She must’ve known
China would give away

04:46.325 --> 04:48.285
the location of the safe house
to Pakistan.

04:48.365 --> 04:51.605
-The Haqqani have to be stopped.
-You know this isn’t about the Haqqani.

04:52.565 --> 04:55.725
It's the US playing hardball
with Pakistan, forcing them to take sides.

04:55.805 --> 04:58.005
And us? Whose side are we on?

04:58.085 --> 05:00.725
I’m not blindly following the Pentagon
into an action

05:00.805 --> 05:04.405
-that would antagonize a nuclear state.
-Four Australians are dead, Ewan.

05:04.485 --> 05:06.925
-It’s on Pakistan’s head.
-The joint committee's investigating--

05:07.005 --> 05:10.045
-The more they talk, the less chance--
-We’ve got 72 hours to locate him!

05:10.365 --> 05:13.245
I want our intelligence talking
to everyone, anyone.

05:13.805 --> 05:17.125
The Saudis. Iran. Use their contacts
in the Taliban if we have to.

05:18.805 --> 05:23.205
Markson’s going to come home,
without anyone provoking a war, Jim.

05:37.965 --> 05:40.125
The cops are saying
his name was John Smith.

05:40.205 --> 05:43.005
Yeah, so do you think that he was hiding?
Like, from Cal?

05:43.485 --> 05:47.165
Everything she did, contacting him,
taking my gun, it all feels planned.

05:47.525 --> 05:49.005
Do you think she’s dangerous?

05:49.085 --> 05:51.405
I think she’s disturbed
and that makes her dangerous.

05:51.965 --> 05:55.565
If she contacts you again, let me know.
Don’t let her get near the Prime Minister.

05:58.405 --> 06:01.125
Have you notified the federal police
and Garrity’s office?

06:01.205 --> 06:03.405
Yeah. They’re increasing his protection.

06:03.845 --> 06:06.645
Listen, she was the drone pilot
the night it was hacked.

06:06.725 --> 06:08.285
What if she knows something?

06:09.645 --> 06:13.605
Yeah, well, whatever there is to know,
I’ll find out in that committee meeting.

06:14.405 --> 06:17.565
By the book. I’m not putting a target
on the PM’s back.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.805
Then we analyzed the audit log records

06:23.885 --> 06:27.565
from the data brick retrieved
from the compromised AOD Nine.

06:28.725 --> 06:30.645
You can see here...

06:34.245 --> 06:38.445
That's... That’s the compromise.
That’s when the drone was taken over.

06:38.685 --> 06:40.685
Now, our cyber analysts then tracked

06:40.765 --> 06:44.165
the source of the hack
to an ISP in Islamabad

06:44.245 --> 06:50.245
and from there, back to the headquarters
of the Pakistani secret service, the ISI.

06:50.325 --> 06:54.325
-Uh, it all looks like Greek to me--
-How do you know it wasn’t a proxy server?

06:56.645 --> 07:00.245
Most hackers, they take steps
to not be so easily identified,

07:00.325 --> 07:02.765
proxy servers, onion routing,
anonymous VPN.

07:04.085 --> 07:09.485
For example, the hacking
of the US Office of Personnel Management,

07:09.565 --> 07:12.805
allegedly by China, was done through
servers based in the States.
How do we know this isn’t a third party
trying to hide behind Pakistan?

07:16.205 --> 07:18.925
-Or trying to put them in the firing line?

07:21.645 --> 07:25.445
Why is the chief of defense
whispering in your ear, Mr. Lavelle?

07:25.525 --> 07:26.845
Don’t you have an answer?

07:27.805 --> 07:30.965
-Ms. Koutoufides, I was--
-You can’t know for sure, can you?

07:31.045 --> 07:34.645
-The member will refrain from badgering.
-I’m not badgering, Gaelene.

07:36.245 --> 07:37.965
I just want Mr. Lavelle
to give me an answer.

07:41.685 --> 07:45.485
You can clearly see
our software’s digital signature

07:45.565 --> 07:49.565
embedded in the flow of information
and that’s a flag.

07:51.045 --> 07:52.165
It’s legitimate.

07:58.005 --> 08:02.845
August 20th, Catriona Bailey sent
embedded information to China...

08:03.405 --> 08:05.005
detailing a Cabinet discussion

08:05.085 --> 08:09.405
about curtailing US satellite information
gathering activities at Pine Gap.

08:10.645 --> 08:15.565
Two days later, a lightning visit
by a senior American military adviser,

08:15.645 --> 08:17.245
glad-handing all the brass.

08:19.645 --> 08:21.325
October 17th.

08:22.445 --> 08:26.565
Bailey informs China of a potential
reopening of trade talks with India.

08:26.965 --> 08:30.565
Within a week, the US
are conducting their own talks.

08:31.645 --> 08:37.205
In almost every case, information
given by Bailey to MSS in China...

08:38.804 --> 08:40.605
was followed by a response from the US.

08:42.845 --> 08:44.965
Meaning they were intercepting
the information?

08:45.924 --> 08:47.285
Without telling us.

08:48.445 --> 08:52.005
They knew she was a spy for years.

08:52.085 --> 08:55.885
If this is true, they knew the safe house
in Miramshah had been compromised.

08:56.445 --> 08:58.005
And stood by while it was ambushed.

08:59.765 --> 09:00.725
Why?

09:01.245 --> 09:02.485
Why didn’t they tell us?

09:05.125 --> 09:06.685
This is great work, William.

09:09.485 --> 09:10.885
But it’s speculation.

09:12.365 --> 09:13.245
Mm.

09:15.645 --> 09:17.645
What if we could get something concrete?

09:21.365 --> 09:25.845
Any surveillance of US authorities
would breach the no-spy arrangement.

09:27.005 --> 09:29.365
If it unraveled,
we’d have to cut you loose.

09:36.605 --> 09:37.965
Let’s find another way.

09:45.325 --> 09:48.245
He must have provided identification
when he rented the house.

09:49.205 --> 09:53.125
If you could send it to Karen Koutoufides'
office, on behalf of the Prime Minister.

09:57.645 --> 09:59.925
Okay, great, I got it. Thank you so much.

10:31.285 --> 10:34.125
So, you got the time
to be looking at pictures...

10:41.765 --> 10:42.765
What the hell?

10:43.685 --> 10:45.245
Keep scrolling. Gets steamier.

10:45.925 --> 10:48.405
-Do you know who sent this?
-Blocked number.

10:48.485 --> 10:51.205
-So, what do they want?
-No idea.

10:51.285 --> 10:54.165
If these get out, it’s going to look like
you influenced the tender process

10:54.245 --> 10:57.845
for the old car factory and that’s why
Vanguard got it, your solar plant.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.165
Never named Vanguard.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.085
The tender process was run
by the state government.

11:02.645 --> 11:06.205
It’s not really about the truth.
It’s optics and that looks really bad.

11:07.165 --> 11:09.005
I can have somebody try
and find the number

11:09.085 --> 11:12.405
-and do a bit of a search, but...
- You know what?

11:13.725 --> 11:16.285
-I get screwed every day in this place.

11:16.365 --> 11:18.285
It’s nice to enjoy it once in a while.

11:19.645 --> 11:20.925
Ca...

11:21.565 --> 11:22.405
Hm.

11:25.085 --> 11:29.925
So, John Smith, it was a...
it’s a fake name and it’s a fake address.

11:30.005 --> 11:33.725
-Did you get the license photograph?
-Yeah, still don’t recognize him,

11:33.805 --> 11:36.685
-but I might have something that helps.
-All right, bye.

11:36.765 --> 11:38.445
Thank you for the extra security.

11:39.485 --> 11:41.285
I was just passing on information.

11:41.365 --> 11:44.605
If the pilot’s got anything, I want it.
Understand?

12:03.405 --> 12:05.365
I’m shocked... truly.

12:06.725 --> 12:09.565
Catriona Bailey was
a great supporter of the Alliance.

12:10.805 --> 12:14.765
You understand the importance of keeping
this known at the highest levels only.

12:15.005 --> 12:18.565
-Special intelligence. ECI.
-Of course.

12:19.125 --> 12:23.685
This is who we think should be informed
and the protocols for doing so.

12:26.565 --> 12:29.045
Let us know if you disagree with anything.

12:30.245 --> 12:31.525
I’ll make sure it gets done.

12:34.125 --> 12:37.285
You tell the Prime Minister,
we’ve got his back.

12:38.805 --> 12:39.805
I will.

13:08.685 --> 13:11.845
Set up the first call for 9:00 a.m.,
Washington time.

13:13.245 --> 13:14.645
I’ll need a secure line.

13:19.045 --> 13:21.685
It arrived this morning, everything
from Cal’s quarters at Woomera.

13:21.765 --> 13:23.165
Oh, thank you.

13:35.445 --> 13:36.565
I’ll leave you to it.

13:37.445 --> 13:40.485
-Hey, what is this?
-It’s a Gallantry Medal.

13:42.845 --> 13:46.565
She was waiting to fly out of Tarinkot
when the base took some mortar fire.

13:46.645 --> 13:50.445
Her SO got hit. Would’ve bled out
if Cal hadn’t put pressure on the wound.

13:50.885 --> 13:54.005
But there was another guy about
two meters away. She had to make a choice.

13:54.765 --> 13:57.405
So she stayed with her SO.
The other guy didn’t make it.

13:59.245 --> 14:00.445
Who was her SO?

14:02.205 --> 14:06.325
He had one star then... but he always had
his eye on the top prize.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.725
Lockwood.

14:16.805 --> 14:17.805
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

14:19.325 --> 14:20.165
Cal.

14:24.045 --> 14:26.965
People are looking for you.
We’re all worried.

14:27.885 --> 14:31.045
<i>Worried about me,</i>
<i>or worried about what I’ll do?</i>

14:34.005 --> 14:35.765
I haven’t forgotten what you did for me.

14:36.285 --> 14:38.285
<i>You've got a funny way</i>
<i>of showing appreciation.</i>

14:38.685 --> 14:40.765
I was trying to help you, Cal.
You know that, right?

14:46.085 --> 14:46.925
Cal?
Cal?

14:53.565 --> 14:56.125
Did you just sit and watch
when they came for me?

14:57.685 --> 14:59.325
<i>You sent me into the lion’s den.</i>

15:00.685 --> 15:02.725
<i>They tried to tear me apart. </i>

15:02.805 --> 15:04.165
I didn’t know what else to do.

15:20.725 --> 15:24.605
Cal... let me call Joe. Let him help you.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.445
Too late for that... sir.

15:33.685 --> 15:34.725
<i>Cal?</i>

16:22.405 --> 16:24.125
How did he even see the photographs?

16:24.965 --> 16:27.245
The envelope was addressed to him.

16:27.325 --> 16:29.085
They wanted him to see them.

16:29.165 --> 16:30.845
<i>Arlo's going to be okay.</i>

16:32.245 --> 16:34.445
He can deal with his mum having sex.

16:34.525 --> 16:37.005
<i>Your life is your life,</i>
<i>I’m not judging you.</i>

16:37.725 --> 16:41.165
Every time you fly out of here,
Arlo asks me, "Is she coming back?"

16:41.245 --> 16:43.005
And I say, "Yes, of course she is.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.685
Mummy has important work
to do in Canberra."

16:46.565 --> 16:49.125
<i>-But he is important, too.</i>
-Mum. Mum.

16:51.205 --> 16:54.525
If I let this get to me, if I change
the way I do things in any way...

16:55.245 --> 16:56.685
I’m being compromised.

16:56.765 --> 17:00.365
I’m just asking you to think of Arlo.

17:01.085 --> 17:04.765
<i>He’s a child</i>
<i>and should not grow up so fast.</i>

17:12.685 --> 17:13.565
F...

17:20.285 --> 17:21.205
You’ve arrived.

17:21.805 --> 17:22.645
Mm.

17:23.445 --> 17:27.565
Same place as before.
Anzac Hall, under the Lancaster.

17:28.324 --> 17:29.445
<i>Just before closing.</i>

17:31.445 --> 17:32.844
<i>Make sure you’re not followed.</i>

17:42.165 --> 17:43.885
<i>I put your position to US command.</i>

17:43.965 --> 17:46.445
They won’t back down
on the Khost base or Kabul.

17:47.005 --> 17:50.685
They’ve informed me they’re ramping up,
increased long-range transport,

17:50.765 --> 17:54.005
reconnaissance aircraft in Qatar
and Diego Garcia.

17:54.085 --> 17:57.485
-They want us to join them.
-Ground troops, air support most likely.

17:58.485 --> 18:01.485
We’re getting nowhere with intelligence
and we’re running out of time.

18:01.565 --> 18:03.525
If the Haqqani decide to take out Markson,

18:03.605 --> 18:06.205
it’ll be difficult politically for us
to refuse the US.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.845
So, US military action's going
to guarantee Markson’s death

18:08.925 --> 18:12.845
and we’re going to be compelled to join
them? We’re being screwed both ways,

18:12.925 --> 18:14.805
without even the courtesy
of a reach-around.

18:18.485 --> 18:20.045
Guys, can you just fuck off?

18:31.045 --> 18:32.045
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:35.045 --> 18:35.965
So...

18:49.165 --> 18:50.925
I’m so sorry, Karen. This is my fault.

18:55.445 --> 18:56.845
-Any idea who sent them?
-No.

18:57.965 --> 19:00.805
No, I didn’t get them, so, whoever it is,
I presume, is targeting you.

19:00.885 --> 19:02.525
Why?

19:04.165 --> 19:07.965
The only bill on the table is an amendment
to compensation for seafarers.

19:08.045 --> 19:09.965
This is not coming
from a pissed-off sailor.

19:10.045 --> 19:11.365
I wouldn’t worry about it.

19:12.965 --> 19:17.365
But if you are, maybe just...
keep your head down for a while.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.125
-Keep my head down for a while?
-Wait till whatever it is blows over.

19:26.525 --> 19:27.565
I’d still like to see you.

19:29.365 --> 19:30.685
Curtains closed this time.

19:36.645 --> 19:40.485
I don’t think that’s such a good idea.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.685
Alex Berezin from Vanguard Energy...

20:09.005 --> 20:10.605
I want to know everything about him.

20:11.805 --> 20:13.165
-What kind of...?
-Everything.

21:17.445 --> 21:19.125
-The Beretta, where is it?
-I don’t have it.

21:21.725 --> 21:23.725
-I should report you.
-You should.

21:24.205 --> 21:25.565
You should report yourself.

21:26.765 --> 21:29.365
-Or what? You’ll drug me again?

21:37.005 --> 21:37.925
Yeah?

21:38.205 --> 21:42.605
Uh, so, John Smith, his real name is
Connor MacPherson, formerly ADF.

21:42.965 --> 21:44.205
-MacPherson?
<i>-Mm-hm.</i>

21:44.285 --> 21:47.605
<i>He was an IT expert,</i>
<i>working in signals in Afghanistan,</i>

21:47.685 --> 21:49.565
<i>same time Cal was there.</i>

21:49.645 --> 21:52.565
<i>And then he left shortly after,</i>
<i>under some kind of cloud.</i>

21:52.645 --> 21:55.765
<i>-No one could give me the full picture.</i>
-What are you thinking?

21:56.285 --> 21:58.485
<i>What if he was the one</i>
<i>who hacked the drone?</i>

21:59.925 --> 22:03.365
<i>I mean, it was under Cal’s control</i>
<i>and then four people died.</i>

22:06.045 --> 22:08.325
What if it was revenge and that’s...

22:09.685 --> 22:11.005
that's why she killed him?

22:14.245 --> 22:18.365
I don’t know why Cal would hurt anyone.
That’s not the person I know.

22:21.405 --> 22:24.005
Well, in my experience,
no one ever really knows anyone.

22:26.485 --> 22:27.485
I got to go.

22:36.885 --> 22:37.845
You need help, Cal.

22:37.925 --> 22:40.285
You don't need to worry about me.
You never did.

22:40.365 --> 22:42.765
Proper help, I can’t do this anymore.

23:04.645 --> 23:07.805
-I want you to do something for me.
-What?

23:09.965 --> 23:11.245
Don’t go back over there.

23:11.325 --> 23:13.125
Don’t ever, ever go back.

23:25.205 --> 23:26.565
She likes you, Sully.

23:28.085 --> 23:29.365
Don’t ruin this one.

23:56.245 --> 23:57.325
All set?

23:57.405 --> 24:00.245
Five mics, omni-directional.
We’re covered 360.

24:00.845 --> 24:04.285
<i>...destroyed</i>
<i>Germany’s industry and its will to fight.</i>

24:04.965 --> 24:06.525
<i>Losses of aircraft improved...</i>

24:10.645 --> 24:15.445
<i>16th of December, 1943,</i>
<i>Lancaster G in George...</i>

24:16.685 --> 24:17.605
Here we go.

24:25.325 --> 24:27.965
- <i>How was your flight?</i>

24:28.845 --> 24:29.765
<i>Economy.</i>

24:31.605 --> 24:34.885
<i>Shit food. But somewhat satisfying.</i>

24:36.525 --> 24:38.085
<i>What does your brother want?</i>

24:40.845 --> 24:43.485
<i>Visas for him and his family.</i>

24:44.965 --> 24:45.805
<i>No.</i>

24:49.285 --> 24:50.365
We need him there.

24:51.885 --> 24:55.045
-We have an operation coming up.
- That’s not possible.

24:55.125 --> 24:58.925
Once his family leaves, he'll...
he will be in great danger. I...

24:59.925 --> 25:03.325
<i>-I don’t think you understand...</i>
- <i>No, I do understand.</i>

25:04.445 --> 25:06.525
<i>-I understand your concern...</i>
-We need a face.

25:07.045 --> 25:11.845
<i>I know it can’t be easy</i>
<i>for him, for you, the kids, his wife...</i>

25:13.205 --> 25:14.165
<i>I can offer this.</i>

25:14.725 --> 25:15.565
Look up.

25:15.645 --> 25:19.245
<i>Once we get everyone on</i>
<i>the ground, right before the operation...</i>

25:20.685 --> 25:21.565
Look up.

25:23.125 --> 25:24.405
<i>...we’ll get his family out.</i>

25:28.405 --> 25:29.325
Got it.

25:29.405 --> 25:30.525
<i>And we’ll get him out.</i>

25:34.645 --> 25:36.365
Naakesh Rahimi.

25:37.005 --> 25:37.845
Afghani.

25:38.885 --> 25:43.205
A clean skin himself,
but, uh, younger brother to Afshin Rahimi.

25:43.285 --> 25:46.005
Afshin’s a mid-level Haqqani commander.

25:46.765 --> 25:49.805
Last known location, Miramshah.

25:49.885 --> 25:52.365
The US are offering asylum
for him and his family?

25:52.445 --> 25:55.485
The only explanation is
Afshin has been working with them.

25:57.405 --> 25:58.845
He’s a CIA mole.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.605
Now we know why they didn’t
tell us about the safe-house ambush.

26:02.165 --> 26:04.445
They wanted to protect
their asset’s identity.

26:07.045 --> 26:09.245
How did you know about the meeting
with Buchanan?

26:10.685 --> 26:11.765
His office.

26:14.205 --> 26:15.525
The bug still there?

26:16.885 --> 26:19.005
-Mm.
-Tell me where it is exactly...
and I’ll send someone in to get rid of it.

26:25.205 --> 26:27.365
Take this to the PM...

26:27.445 --> 26:29.005
and stand the hell back.

26:36.005 --> 26:39.445
Trebuchet are telling the committee
that they traced it to Pakistan.

26:39.925 --> 26:42.765
But you’re saying
it could be this Connor MacPherson.

26:42.845 --> 26:44.965
-Yeah, it could be.
-And the pilot?

26:45.685 --> 26:47.005
Well, I’m not sure.

26:47.085 --> 26:49.365
I mean, I’m just, uh... speculating--

26:49.445 --> 26:50.405
-KK?
-But I...

26:51.285 --> 26:53.845
-Uh, that search you wanted me to do?
-Uh-huh?

26:55.325 --> 26:56.565
Oh, Harriet’s briefed.

26:56.645 --> 26:59.645
Uh, nothing came up
on Alex Berezin, but Vanguard...

26:59.725 --> 27:02.085
I had to go through a couple
of offshore dummy corporations,

27:02.165 --> 27:04.445
but eventually, I got
to the parent company.

27:07.045 --> 27:08.045
Trebuchet.

27:12.645 --> 27:16.765
We need to remember that Pakistan
has essentially been protecting

27:16.845 --> 27:18.205
the Haqqani for years...

27:18.765 --> 27:22.085
allowing them to operate
with impunity from within their borders.

27:22.645 --> 27:26.365
General Nazir was in a Haqqani vehicle,
after all.

27:27.125 --> 27:31.605
Now, these are ruthless terrorists,
responsible for many, many deaths,

27:31.685 --> 27:34.485
and propped up by a government
benefiting from their presence.

27:35.765 --> 27:38.125
Pale Horse did not create a problem.

27:39.405 --> 27:41.165
The problem was already there.

27:41.645 --> 27:43.725
Okay, thank you, Air Chief Marshal.

27:43.805 --> 27:45.765
I think we have enough now
to begin deliberations--

27:45.845 --> 27:47.085
Just a minute, Gaelene.

27:48.005 --> 27:52.125
Before we consider submissions, I would
like an independent review of the evidence

27:52.205 --> 27:54.725
provided to the committee
by the Trebuchet Corporation.

27:55.205 --> 27:58.445
The data retrieved from the crashed drone,

27:58.525 --> 28:02.645
which, according to Mr. Lavelle,
supports their assertion

28:02.725 --> 28:06.325
that the AOD Nine was hacked
by the Pakistani secret service...

28:06.405 --> 28:09.725
I’m sorry, Deputy Chair,
but now is not the time to stall--

28:09.805 --> 28:11.925
This is not stalling, Jim.

28:12.765 --> 28:13.965
This is fact checking.

28:15.005 --> 28:16.085
We still have time.

28:16.925 --> 28:20.925
And we also have our own specialists
in the Australian Signals Directorate.

28:21.005 --> 28:24.805
Now, I request that they verify
the material put to us.

28:26.565 --> 28:27.805
And if they do?

28:28.125 --> 28:29.765
Then we make a recommendation.

28:41.245 --> 28:43.605
I got your message.
What's all the excitement?

28:44.285 --> 28:45.365
Come inside.

28:46.445 --> 28:48.885
-What is it, Mum?
-I’ve got a surprise for you.

28:56.645 --> 28:59.045
I hardly ever get to meet
any of Harri’s friends.

28:59.125 --> 29:02.125
-What’d you say, Mum?
-She likes to keep them to herself.

29:04.645 --> 29:05.805
Hello, Harriet.

29:07.645 --> 29:10.645
One thing about Harriet,
she’d do anything for a mate.

29:11.925 --> 29:14.285
That went fast. I’ll get another.

29:21.765 --> 29:23.565
-Get out.
-Call your boss.

29:23.885 --> 29:26.605
-I want that meeting with Garrity.
-I know all about Connor MacPherson.

29:26.685 --> 29:27.645
You don’t know anything.

29:27.725 --> 29:29.485
-I’m going to call the police.
-Don’t do that.

29:34.445 --> 29:35.445
Here we go.

29:45.765 --> 29:47.045
What’s going on, Harri?

29:50.725 --> 29:52.205
-Who are you?
-We haven’t got time.

29:52.285 --> 29:54.325
- I’ll do it.
- Time to what?

29:55.005 --> 29:57.365
-Harriet, talk to me, please.
-It’s okay, Mum.
-Karen, it’s Harriet.
-It’s Joe. You've rung the wrong number.

30:06.725 --> 30:07.565
<i>Wait.</i>

30:08.085 --> 30:09.125
Put it on speaker.

30:22.765 --> 30:25.205
- <i>Harriet?</i>
-Karen, I need you to listen to me.

30:25.765 --> 30:28.045
<i>Do you, uh...</i>
<i>Do you remember the drone pilot?</i>

30:28.405 --> 30:29.605
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:29.685 --> 30:32.165
<i>She needs</i>
<i>to see Garrity right away.</i>

30:32.245 --> 30:34.965
-That's never going to happen.
-Tell her to make it happen.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.845
What... What’s going on, Harriet?

30:38.925 --> 30:40.485
<i>Is she there with you now?</i>

30:40.565 --> 30:42.445
Karen, you have to speak to Garrity.

30:42.845 --> 30:45.045
- <i>What’s this about?</i>
- <i>Tonight.</i>

30:46.685 --> 30:49.565
-He’s the Prime Minister.
- <i>Call back when it’s done.</i>

30:50.045 --> 30:50.885
Hang up.

31:20.605 --> 31:22.285
Here’s what you’re going to do.

31:22.925 --> 31:24.565
You’re going to tell the Haqqani

31:24.645 --> 31:27.765
you’ll give up the identity
of the CIA mole in their midst...

31:28.965 --> 31:30.885
and, in return,
they’ll release Corporal Markson.

31:34.005 --> 31:36.365
But that would be a death sentence
for our man.

31:36.445 --> 31:38.645
What about our men? One’s already dead.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.845
The other’s trussed up like a chicken
in a Haqqani hideout.

31:42.365 --> 31:43.725
That’s on your government’s head.

31:54.685 --> 31:57.045
I’ve talked up the Alliance in the past.

31:59.325 --> 32:04.405
I’ve sung from the hymn book about
shared values and bonds of friendship,

32:04.485 --> 32:06.845
but friendship’s nothing
if it’s in name only.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.085
It’s got to be backed, by action,
by political will!

32:12.125 --> 32:15.565
Now, we’ve been there,
ready to follow, whenever you asked.

32:16.725 --> 32:19.045
And where were you
when we really needed you?

32:20.765 --> 32:22.885
In '62, in '99.

32:23.485 --> 32:27.045
Where are you now?
Knifing us in the back with one hand,

32:27.125 --> 32:29.765
holding the other out for help
at the same time?

32:32.605 --> 32:35.365
You want to be our friend, Kip,
then fucking step up.

32:46.925 --> 32:49.485
I’ll pass on your request, Prime Minister.

32:50.165 --> 32:51.405
Yeah, you do that.

32:57.845 --> 32:59.125
Don’t leave anything out.

33:06.125 --> 33:07.485
-Yes.

33:08.965 --> 33:09.965
Prime Minister.

33:32.445 --> 33:33.365
Karen?

33:34.805 --> 33:36.805
The Carillon, 9:00 p.m.

33:41.965 --> 33:42.885
Great.

34:10.845 --> 34:14.485
Take your positions. Keep your comms on at
all times. You’re linked in to everyone.

34:15.845 --> 34:16.765
Five minutes.

34:58.325 --> 34:59.845
I’m sorry I had to do it this way.

35:06.725 --> 35:08.325
Tell your mum I never would’ve hurt her.

35:10.005 --> 35:10.845
She’s nice.

35:13.845 --> 35:14.925
She is.
Harriet...

35:30.765 --> 35:31.765
It was me.

35:36.245 --> 35:39.845
The house in Davoren Park... it was me.

35:41.885 --> 35:43.085
Connor did all the work.

35:44.965 --> 35:47.565
Built a shadow data brick for the AOD Nine

35:47.645 --> 35:49.445
with identical mission instructions,

35:49.525 --> 35:51.485
until the landing gear was activated

35:51.565 --> 35:54.445
and the drone was diverted
to Davoren Park. He built it.

35:56.445 --> 36:01.765
I swapped it with the original on
the Tarmac at Woomera, but it was my idea.

36:11.085 --> 36:12.165
It’s all on here.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.325
All the data...

36:16.405 --> 36:17.365
and my confession.

36:28.285 --> 36:29.645
Cal, you chose that house?

36:31.405 --> 36:32.525
Picked the Lamberts?

36:33.765 --> 36:35.045
I had to pick somewhere.

36:35.765 --> 36:38.925
We were killing innocent people every day
and no one cared.

36:39.005 --> 36:42.405
And I... I thought... the only way people
are going to take notice

36:42.485 --> 36:44.245
is if innocent people die here.

36:46.045 --> 36:47.285
I don’t regret it.

36:48.685 --> 36:49.645
Except for Connor.

36:51.245 --> 36:53.005
I should never have involved him.

36:53.085 --> 36:56.045
-Then why would you kill him?
-I didn’t.

36:57.125 --> 36:58.165
Then who did?

37:12.005 --> 37:15.405
Trebuchet are claiming that
Pakistan intelligence hacked the drone.

37:15.485 --> 37:17.485
So, if you did it,
that means they’re lying.

37:18.805 --> 37:21.005
Did they kill Connor to cover their lie?

37:23.925 --> 37:27.885
War is just an opportunity for them.
It’s just dollars.

37:27.965 --> 37:31.085
Okay, but they’re not going
to care about your reasons, Cal.

37:31.165 --> 37:32.965
You’ve committed treason and murder.

37:33.045 --> 37:35.485
You go out there
and you spend your life in jail.

37:35.565 --> 37:38.045
I know, but I have to.
This time, I can fix it.

38:03.845 --> 38:05.725
<i>Checking target</i>
<i>to see if she's armed.</i>

38:30.125 --> 38:31.125
She’s clean.

38:40.805 --> 38:43.125
I want a guarantee
Cal’s going to be okay, sir.

38:49.765 --> 38:51.245
That depends on her.

38:58.845 --> 39:01.525
I have to talk to Garrity.
I know what I’m doing.

39:01.605 --> 39:03.005
You are talking to him, Cal.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.645
But this is as close as you're gonna get.

39:16.965 --> 39:20.325
<i>You said you wanted the truth...</i>
<i>I have it.</i>

39:22.485 --> 39:23.685
<i>On a USB.</i>

39:26.485 --> 39:27.965
<i>All the evidence you need.</i>

39:44.485 --> 39:46.045
-Cal, no.
-It’s okay.

39:46.125 --> 39:47.765
She’s got a weapon. Take it!

39:49.005 --> 39:49.885
<i>Target's hit.</i>

39:50.925 --> 39:53.125
- <i>Cease fire.</i>
- <i>Stand down.</i>

39:53.405 --> 39:54.365
Shit.

39:57.525 --> 40:01.325
- <i>Immediate medic...</i>

40:01.405 --> 40:02.485
<i>Cal?</i>

40:03.045 --> 40:05.205
<i>-Get a medic!</i>

40:05.285 --> 40:06.765
<i>Stay with me, Cal.</i>

40:08.365 --> 40:09.525
<i>Stay with me, Cal.</i>

40:13.725 --> 40:17.965
<i>-Tell... Tell Garrity...</i>
- <i>You can tell him yourself.</i>

40:19.605 --> 40:20.805
<i>You're going to be okay, Cal.</i>

40:24.565 --> 40:25.405
Cal.
Cal!

40:33.765 --> 40:34.765
Come on.

40:36.245 --> 40:37.245
Come on, Cal.

40:38.405 --> 40:39.325
Come on.

40:41.005 --> 40:42.285
<i>Come on, Cal.</i>

40:45.085 --> 40:46.085
<i>Stay with me.</i>

40:47.805 --> 40:48.645
<i>Come on.</i>

40:53.685 --> 40:55.805
- Sullivan! Get him off!

40:56.285 --> 40:57.885
-Come on.
-Come on, Joe.

41:07.805 --> 41:08.925
Get off me.

41:18.205 --> 41:20.285
I’ve completed my assessment
on the Davoren Park hack.

41:20.845 --> 41:22.365
-Well, send it through.
-I did.

41:22.805 --> 41:25.685
I should say that my recommendation
is at odds with yours.

41:25.765 --> 41:27.725
It was very sophisticated work, Thomas.

41:28.285 --> 41:30.565
But someone definitely manipulated
that data.

41:31.045 --> 41:32.725
The time-stamp signature wasn’t correct.

41:32.805 --> 41:34.645
There was no jump back
to a server in Islamabad.

41:34.725 --> 41:36.125
My assessment remains the same.

41:36.845 --> 41:41.045
The drone hack was an act of aggression by
Pakistan, an attack on our sovereign soil.

41:41.125 --> 41:44.285
On what possible basis
do you make that assessment?

41:46.805 --> 41:48.205
It’s all in the file I sent.

42:01.445 --> 42:02.565
<i>Where’s Mina?</i>

42:04.565 --> 42:06.165
<i>Don’t you watch the news?</i>

42:11.765 --> 42:14.405
<i>How do you think this works?</i>
<i>I can’t take them back.</i>

42:14.485 --> 42:16.845
<i>We could get</i>
<i>20 fucking years for this.</i>

42:17.765 --> 42:18.645
<i>No.</i>

42:19.685 --> 42:22.245
<i>I don’t know how many. I...</i>

42:22.965 --> 42:24.765
<i>Maybe 200 Berettas.</i>

42:25.685 --> 42:26.925
<i>Jesus.</i>

42:28.285 --> 42:30.645
<i>They’re buried in the system.</i>
<i>No one will know.</i>

42:31.845 --> 42:36.045
<i>-I can’t live like this, William, please.</i>
<i>-You stole fucking ADF weapons, Helen.</i>

42:36.125 --> 42:39.405
<i>That’s court-martial. That’s treason.</i>

42:53.645 --> 42:56.805
What evidence, Jim?
Why’d she want to see me so badly?

42:56.885 --> 42:59.445
Who gave the order to shoot?
She said she had answers.

43:00.685 --> 43:03.325
You’ve seen her records.
She had a lot of problems.

43:06.805 --> 43:08.565
I’m going to need the room, Karen.

43:09.365 --> 43:10.445
Yes, Prime Minister.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.285
Got a location on Markson.

43:23.365 --> 43:25.565
US is sending in a task force
to pick him up.

43:30.965 --> 43:32.165
What did I miss?

43:32.925 --> 43:34.005
It’s a good result.

43:39.565 --> 43:42.445
Well, congratulations.
The joint committee can now report--

43:42.525 --> 43:44.245
I’m gonna need to respond to this.

44:25.925 --> 44:27.325
Joe? Hey, Joe.

44:28.125 --> 44:29.925
Joe? Joe.

44:31.045 --> 44:34.045
Take a nice deep breath. There you go.

44:34.605 --> 44:36.165
-Oh, fuck.
-You’re all right.

44:36.245 --> 44:37.685
-Fuck.
-You’re all right.

44:40.645 --> 44:41.765
You’re okay.

44:44.965 --> 44:46.005
I’m so sorry.

44:52.605 --> 44:54.405
-No...
-It’s okay.

45:09.805 --> 45:10.805
All sorted?

45:13.085 --> 45:14.365
I believe so.

45:18.565 --> 45:19.965
There’s still one loose end.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.005
I’ll see to it.
