<i>Previously on</i> Gotham:

00:02.570 --> 00:03.635
(grunts)

00:03.637 --> 00:05.270
BULLOCK:
<i>The guys call him the Ogre.</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:06.905
<i>He's a serial killer.</i>

00:06.907 --> 00:09.541
Whoever did this is a monster.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.211
The blood of his next victim
is on my hands.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.113
If you don't drop it,
that blood could be Lee's.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.382
<i>Because the Ogre
retaliates against any cop</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:19.184
<i>who investigates and kills
the people they love.</i>

00:19.186 --> 00:20.853
BRUCE: <i>The man who stabbed
Alfred, he's in Gotham.</i>

00:20.855 --> 00:22.287
You need
my help to find him.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.023
Who sent you?

00:24.025 --> 00:27.026
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

00:27.028 --> 00:28.427
(screaming)

00:31.598 --> 00:34.133
(train clacking, bell clangs,
ship's horn toots)

00:36.669 --> 00:38.737
(car horns honk,
siren wails in distance)

00:42.609 --> 00:44.977
Hey!

00:47.047 --> 00:49.081
You look far from home.

00:50.683 --> 00:52.584
Get away from him.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.253
Or what?

00:55.488 --> 00:57.489
(scoffs)

00:57.491 --> 00:59.558
Whatever.

01:04.497 --> 01:05.864
SELINA: Come on.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.166
Did you go back?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.234
Yeah.
The cops are there.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.538
And?

01:12.540 --> 01:14.039
And?

01:14.041 --> 01:15.974
What do you think?

01:15.976 --> 01:18.710
He fell out of
a five-story window. He's dead.

01:20.313 --> 01:21.880
(voice breaks):
Why'd you do it?

01:21.882 --> 01:24.283
He told us what we wanted.
He told us about Bunderslaw.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.417
You didn't have to go
and kill the guy!

01:25.419 --> 01:26.952
Yes, I did!
'Cause the moment we'd left,

01:26.954 --> 01:28.320
he was gonna go tell his boss!

01:28.322 --> 01:30.622
Who works for you,
by the way.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.524
He's the one who
tried to kill me,

01:32.526 --> 01:35.427
who tried to kill your butler...

01:35.429 --> 01:37.696
who probably
killed your parents.

01:37.698 --> 01:41.233
I saved your life.

01:41.235 --> 01:44.069
Besides... you wanted
to do it, too.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.472
You just didn't
have the guts.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.542
Wait...!
Just go home.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.711
We still have to find out who
Bunderslaw is and what he wants.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.179
You mean you do.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.981
You really think this is over?

01:55.983 --> 01:58.217
He's gonna come after us.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.820
So what's next? Hmm?

02:05.558 --> 02:07.059
His safe.

02:07.061 --> 02:08.327
What?

02:08.329 --> 02:09.862
Every senior executive
at Wayne Enterprises

02:09.864 --> 02:11.263
has a safe in their office.

02:11.265 --> 02:14.133
A-Any secrets Bunderslaw has,
that's where they'll be.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.634
Key or combination?

02:15.636 --> 02:18.270
Key. My dad had one.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.473
He'll probably
keep it on him, then.

02:22.742 --> 02:25.210
Figure out a way to get
me close, and I'll steal it.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.712
Can you do that?

02:26.714 --> 02:27.980
I think so.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.448
And what happened tonight,

02:29.450 --> 02:32.284
you tell no one.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.620
Not your buddy
Detective Gordon,

02:34.622 --> 02:36.622
not your butler.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.690
No one.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.911 --> 03:00.179
Punctures on test subject
are consistent with those

03:00.181 --> 03:03.115
on the victim, indicating
the killer was right-handed.

03:06.653 --> 03:07.920
Yum.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.422
Where's Thompkins?

03:10.424 --> 03:12.558
Detective Gordon,
Dr. Thompkins said I was free

03:12.560 --> 03:13.926
to use this room.
She's very nice.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.194
She's not like
the old medical examiner.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.462
Ed, just tell me where she is.

03:17.464 --> 03:18.931
No riddles.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.499
Home. She went home.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.237
Hope you find her.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.383
(phone buzzes)

03:40.587 --> 03:42.888
(glass breaks in distance)
(gasps)

03:44.591 --> 03:46.158
Jim?

03:48.595 --> 03:51.697
Jim, is that you?

04:19.524 --> 04:20.591
(meows)
(gasps)

04:25.531 --> 04:28.934
(meowing)
You're lucky I don't skin you.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.505
Go on.

04:36.075 --> 04:38.143
(dials phone)

04:39.312 --> 04:40.646
(phone rings)

04:42.715 --> 04:45.350
I... slow down.
Lee, please.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.352
Start over.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.520
This case you caught,
the dead woman,

04:48.522 --> 04:49.988
she was murdered
by a serial killer?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.723
Yes. Who's killed

04:51.725 --> 04:53.091
a dozen women, maybe more.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.894
And Loeb gave you
this on purpose?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.529
He wants to hurt me.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.698
And how am I in danger?

04:59.700 --> 05:03.035
He murders the loved ones
of any cop

05:03.037 --> 05:04.803
who investigates him.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.272
It's how he's been able
to get away with it so far.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.074
Anyone who
comes after him,

05:09.076 --> 05:10.275
he's killed someone they love

05:10.277 --> 05:11.977
and the investigation's
been buried.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.713
Bullock knows a cop...

05:14.715 --> 05:16.448
Came home and found his wife.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.818
Her throat had been cut.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.556
Oh...

05:24.558 --> 05:26.825
That's why Loeb
gave me the case.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.461
Either I give up,
like everyone else...

05:29.463 --> 05:31.930
and live, knowing
I let a killer go free...

05:31.932 --> 05:33.832
or I keep on,

05:33.834 --> 05:36.868
and someone I love is killed.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.274
You're not
giving up, are you?

05:42.276 --> 05:43.675
I can't.

05:45.311 --> 05:48.180
That's why I need you
to get out of Gotham right now.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.548
Tonight.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.883
No.

05:53.119 --> 05:55.554
You want to protect me?
Find him.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.858
I'm gonna stay here
and do my job.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.897
But I do like
that you think of me

06:05.899 --> 06:07.966
as a loved one.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.737
I do.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.174
Love you.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.910
And it only took a serial killer
to get you to say that.

06:26.285 --> 06:27.753
Thanks.
Yeah.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.098
Hi.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.845
(door opens, closes)

06:59.619 --> 07:01.987
This is it.

07:01.989 --> 07:05.023
Home sweet, you know.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.460
This is a great space.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.695
Selina?

07:10.697 --> 07:12.230
Hmm.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.599
Sort of a roommate.
Hmm.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.935
She comes and goes.

07:19.872 --> 07:22.974
Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball.
Didn't you know

07:22.976 --> 07:24.876
I'm a member of society?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.144
I go every year.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.714
Get my picture taken
in a pretty dress.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.917
Smile.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.899
Aren't you scared
of my being here?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.335
Should I be?

07:50.337 --> 07:52.437
Are you dangerous?

07:52.439 --> 07:55.006
I don't know... is your
boyfriend gonna come home?

07:56.542 --> 07:59.010
I never said I had a boyfriend.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.888
I assumed a woman
as beautiful as you...

08:09.890 --> 08:11.623
You assumed
I had a boyfriend

08:11.625 --> 08:13.992
and you assumed
I would be the kind of woman

08:13.994 --> 08:15.727
who would cheat on him.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.362
Well, I'm not.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.998
And I don't have a boyfriend.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.734
And if a bus
hit me tomorrow,

08:22.736 --> 08:24.836
no one would care.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.042
That change things?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.044
Yes, actually, it does.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.278
Make it more illicit?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.746
Or would there be less chance
of us getting attached...

08:35.749 --> 08:37.749
One night and done.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.150
Only that would happen anyway.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.686
Because once you saw
the real me,

08:41.688 --> 08:44.456
you would run screaming,
like everyone else.

08:46.959 --> 08:50.295
I have to say, you're not
who I imagined you'd be.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.364
Surprise.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.667
You can let yourself out.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.739

09:00.741 --> 09:03.675

(laughs)

09:14.288 --> 09:16.688
But first I have to finish
with that gentleman.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.156
Who knew running

09:18.158 --> 09:21.159
a nightclub was
so much work?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.194
My poor darling.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.038
As I was saying,

you and your crew are the best

09:36.376 --> 09:38.977
Your hit on
Councilman Klein...

09:38.979 --> 09:40.879
A thing of beauty.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.448
And I'm a fan, so...
Cheers.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.350
What do you want?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.152
For you to help me
kill Don Maroni

09:47.154 --> 09:49.354
and all of his
lieutenants.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.690
You're having a laugh.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.626
I'm fairly certain I'm not.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.528
And Falcone's
good with this?

09:56.530 --> 09:58.063
He will be.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.065
When it's done.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.732
Thank you.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.167
No, thank you.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.102
So you like
being number two.

10:06.339 --> 10:10.075
Falcone gives Victor Zsasz first
dibs on every new contract.

10:10.077 --> 10:13.511
You bring him the bullet-riddled
corpse of his enemy

10:13.513 --> 10:15.580
and all of that
will change.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.849
This is your
chance to move up.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.986
(wry chuckle)

10:20.988 --> 10:23.121
You're a mad fella, aren't ya?

10:24.991 --> 10:26.558
Fair enough.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.460
Come by the bar tomorrow.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.528
We'll talk details.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.536
What's this about, Harvey?

10:38.538 --> 10:39.638
BULLOCK:
Have a seat.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.606
This is my partner
Jim Gordon.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.108
Detective.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.977
Eight years ago,
you investigated the murder

10:45.979 --> 10:47.646
of a woman named
Julie Kemble.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.882
That was a long time ago.
It was the Ogre.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.384
Julie Kemble
was his first victim.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.219
But you dropped
the investigation,

10:54.221 --> 10:55.453
and because of that,

10:55.455 --> 10:57.022
11 more women
have been murdered.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.590
(chuckles)
Seriously, guys, you know...

10:58.592 --> 10:59.991
Stop.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.960
We also know
the Ogre

11:01.962 --> 11:04.663
kills the loved ones of
the cops that hunt him down.

11:05.564 --> 11:07.232
That pattern started with you.

11:08.634 --> 11:11.336
We think you found something
that spooked him.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.839
Your notes
from the investigation.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.307
The last page,

11:16.309 --> 11:17.876
something's been
scratched out.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.377
I want to know what.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.381
He killed my wife.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.184
I still got
a daughter, Harvey.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.888
Beth Tudor.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.656
Katherine Wood.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.391
Jessica Parker.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.860
11 women.

11:37.296 --> 11:40.765
Each one was
someone's daughter.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.634
It has to stop.

11:42.636 --> 11:45.370
Yeah. I was doing background

11:45.372 --> 11:48.873
on the dead girl.
Someone told me she was a nurse

11:48.875 --> 11:50.875
for a private
medical clinic uptown.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.211
It was on Grant and 80th.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.113
Some cosmetic place.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.615
We'll put cops on your daughter
until this is done.

12:04.623 --> 12:06.791
(camera clicks)

12:20.473 --> 12:21.639
So you forgive me?

12:21.641 --> 12:24.175
Mm-hmm.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.577
I'll see you tonight.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.645
Mm-hmm.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.216
How's it hanging,
Riddle Man?

12:31.218 --> 12:33.752
Uh, it's hanging...

12:33.754 --> 12:35.754
fine.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.889
(trembling sigh)

12:37.891 --> 12:40.825
Mr. Nygma,

12:40.827 --> 12:42.660
did you need something?

12:42.662 --> 12:44.329
Oh. Yes. Uh...

12:44.331 --> 12:46.498
Detective Gordon wanted me to go
through the forensic evidence

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
of these old murders.

12:47.501 --> 12:49.000
Okay.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.002
Are those bruises?

12:51.004 --> 12:52.103
Uh...

12:52.105 --> 12:54.672
Did Officer Dougherty do that?

12:54.674 --> 12:57.142
Um, he was... upset,
and he didn't mean to.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.110
I-I said some things
I shouldn't have, and...

12:59.112 --> 13:00.145
Miss Kringle,
this is not right.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.147
He can't just...

13:01.148 --> 13:02.447
Mr. Nygma,

13:02.449 --> 13:05.517
it is none of your concern.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.852
Now, I-I need
to get started

13:07.854 --> 13:10.221
on these files, so...

13:31.544 --> 13:33.311
Alfred.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.013
Should you be up?

13:35.015 --> 13:36.748
Oh, thank you, Master Bruce.
I feel...

13:36.750 --> 13:38.583
I feel much better.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.251
Can I get you anything?

13:40.253 --> 13:42.921
Yes, actually.
I've decided to attend

13:42.923 --> 13:45.323
the Wayne Enterprises
Charity Ball tonight.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.891
All the senior management
will be there,

13:46.893 --> 13:48.226
and I think people should see

13:48.228 --> 13:50.428
that a Wayne is still
at the head of the company.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.430
I shall set your tux out
for you.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.032
Alfred...

13:54.034 --> 13:56.167
Yes, Master Bruce.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.940
Wh-When you were in the army...

14:01.942 --> 14:05.210
you had to kill people, right?

14:05.212 --> 14:06.678
Yes.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.246
Yes, I did.

14:08.248 --> 14:11.216
And it was necessary?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.551
Oh, I see... so you overheard
the conversation

14:13.553 --> 14:16.020
that Reggie and I had
that was best left unsaid.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.022
But in answer
to your question, yes.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.992
Yes, it was necessary.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.561
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

14:23.563 --> 14:25.330
I better go and find
my good cufflinks,

14:25.332 --> 14:26.931
if we're stepping out.

14:26.933 --> 14:29.534
No, but, uh, you're-you're
still recovering.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.469
What, I'm supposed
to let you walk into that nest

14:31.471 --> 14:32.871
of vipers on your tod?

14:32.873 --> 14:34.873
There'll be hundreds
of people there, Alfred.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.841
I won't be in any danger.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.877
So you say.
But you're not gonna go alone.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.079
I won't be alone.

14:42.281 --> 14:44.949
I've invited Selina Kyle.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.751
Selina Kyle?

14:46.753 --> 14:50.021
To the Wayne Enterprises Ball?

14:50.023 --> 14:52.457
I see.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.559
What do you see?

14:54.561 --> 14:56.628
Nothing. I mean, you know...
I mean, you're...

14:56.630 --> 14:59.163
a healthy young lad and
she's a very pretty young girl

14:59.165 --> 15:01.499
with a penchant of wearing,
well, a little too much leather.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.767
Alfred, it's not like that.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.469
Then what's it like?

15:05.437 --> 15:07.372
Well...

15:07.374 --> 15:09.207
well, what if it is, huh?

15:09.209 --> 15:11.142
What's wrong with that?

15:11.144 --> 15:14.445
Absolutely nothing.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.115
So, I will wait
in the car outside,

15:17.117 --> 15:19.651
so you don't feel
my watchful eye,

15:19.653 --> 15:22.720
but I will be close by,
if there needs be.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.522
That is

15:24.524 --> 15:25.823
the deal.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.659
Fine.

15:27.661 --> 15:28.993
Could you call
around and send

15:28.995 --> 15:32.130
some dresses and shoes
to where she's staying?

15:32.132 --> 15:34.198
This is the address.

15:35.734 --> 15:38.102
It's a charity ball, Alfred.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.272
I'll be fine.

15:49.815 --> 15:51.316
Freaky, huh?

15:51.318 --> 15:54.652
You wonder how they recognize
themselves after.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.722
Doc Thompkins is fine.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.425
No one's gonna touch her
at the precinct. Relax.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.328
You do understand it's because
of me that she's in danger.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.129
Anything that happens
is my fault.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.597
You can't hold yourself
responsible

16:06.599 --> 16:08.399
for the actions of a psychopath.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.768
Sure, I can.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.904
Detectives...
I'm Dr. Cushman.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.238
How can I help you?

16:14.240 --> 16:16.107
We're looking into the murder

16:16.109 --> 16:17.508
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.510
She worked here
about eight years ago.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.913
Of course.
Terrible thing.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.715
Julie was a talented nurse.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.250
But she'd only just started here
when it happened.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.920
She'd been recommended
by one of our patients.

16:28.922 --> 16:31.322
The patient's name?
(scoffs): Well, I'm afraid

16:31.324 --> 16:32.657
I can't give you that.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.659
Confidentiality.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.326
Really?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.595
You're gonna make
us get a warrant?

16:37.597 --> 16:39.430
Yes.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.432
"I specialize in fake boobs,
but I got ethics.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.767
I need a warrant."

16:42.769 --> 16:44.936
We'll talk to Judge Harkness.
I'm sure...

16:47.873 --> 16:51.476
That car was in front
of the precinct.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.077
Jim, wait up.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.719
(starts engine)

17:01.721 --> 17:02.920
(tires screeching)

17:06.058 --> 17:07.191
(tires screeching)

17:07.193 --> 17:08.259
(car horn blaring)

17:12.263 --> 17:13.263
You sure about this?

17:13.266 --> 17:14.398
It was him.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.800
You saw his face?

17:15.801 --> 17:17.801
No. I should've been looking
for a tail.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.804
It's obvious
he tracks our investigations.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.606
BULLOCK:
Called in a description of
the car and a partial plate,

17:21.608 --> 17:22.973
but I'm not too hopeful.

17:22.976 --> 17:24.809
So what's the next move?

17:24.810 --> 17:25.977
Gordon, you got a call.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.779
Says it's urgent.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.384
Gordon.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.886
JASON:
Detective.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.455
I didn't get a chance to say
hello properly in the alley.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.657
Listen to me...
Don't bother tracing this.
I won't be long.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.326
I'm giving you one chance
to turn yourself in.

17:42.328 --> 17:45.830
You make me come after you,
and I will put you down.

17:45.832 --> 17:46.964
Something tells me you've begun

17:46.966 --> 17:48.900
to buy your own press,
Detective.

17:48.902 --> 17:52.003
The hero cop
who's gonna clean up Gotham.

17:52.005 --> 17:55.173
The rising star of the GCPD.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.041
I'll stop you,
that's for damn sure.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.476
No, Detective, you won't.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.544
But keep on your present course,

17:59.546 --> 18:01.012
and I will kill
someone you love.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.481
This is your only warning.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.517
(click, dial tone)

18:06.519 --> 18:08.086
BULLOCK:
Oh, no.

18:08.088 --> 18:11.289
Tell me that wasn't him.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.594
He's used to intimidating cops.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.830
We have to show him
we're not afraid.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.032
And how do we do that?

18:24.069 --> 18:25.403
You're okay with this?
You're sure?

18:25.405 --> 18:27.205
Yes.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.107
It's the right thing to do.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.949
(cameras clicking)

18:37.951 --> 18:40.952
I called you here today...

18:40.954 --> 18:42.954
because the people of Gotham
deserve to know

18:42.956 --> 18:45.456
that there's a serial killer
in their midst.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.326
For years,
he's killed with impunity,

18:48.328 --> 18:52.597
aided by a culture of silence
and fear among the police.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.299
That ends now.

18:55.301 --> 18:59.303
We'll be providing the names and
photos of all of the victims.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.305
Please call
with any information.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.941
And to the man who committed
these horrific crimes,

19:03.943 --> 19:07.678
(on TV):
your days of hiding are over.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.548
I'm coming after you.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.084
And I'm not gonna stop.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.194
(sighs)
What are those for?

19:23.196 --> 19:25.496
The Wayne Charity Ball.

19:25.498 --> 19:29.634
It's boring but good for
the gallery's business.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.835
Well, I'll probably see you
there.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.804
(knocking on door)
What?

19:33.806 --> 19:35.506
I'm going with Bruce Wayne.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.643
Wait, what?

19:38.645 --> 19:40.244
MAN:
Hello. Delivery.
SELINA: Oh.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.947
Uh, over there.

19:46.885 --> 19:47.985
MAN:
Thank you. Enjoy.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.087
(man speaks
indistinctly)

19:50.089 --> 19:52.390
(door shuts)

19:53.425 --> 19:54.425
(sighs)

19:54.427 --> 19:56.928
Am I really supposed
to wear these?

19:56.930 --> 19:58.262
Okay...

19:58.264 --> 20:01.732
we have a lot
of work to do.

20:06.872 --> 20:07.872
Got it.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.874
That was the doctor.

20:08.875 --> 20:09.907
Harkness sent over the warrant.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.375
The dead girl came
to the clinic

20:11.377 --> 20:14.212
by way of a Miss Constance
van Groot.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.814
Van Groot... that's one
of Gotham's oldest families.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.550
Shipping.
Yeah. We thought the
Ogre might be rich.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.320
Could be the old lady
had a son.
You got an address?

20:22.322 --> 20:23.322
Right here.

20:23.323 --> 20:27.892
♪ ♪

20:27.894 --> 20:31.963
Well, Butch, Connor
and his crew are on board.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.631
They hate Maroni
even more than I...

20:33.633 --> 20:36.534
Shut up. Maroni and
his crew are here.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.469
I couldn't turn 'em away.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.371
No, of course. No matter.
No.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.572
She was already here.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.474
MARONI: Is that
my buddy Oswald?

20:43.476 --> 20:44.609
(gasps)
Come here.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.143
Oh, Oswald.

20:50.148 --> 20:52.717
(Maroni chuckles)

20:53.952 --> 20:55.519
There he is.

20:55.521 --> 20:58.022
Mother, what are you doing?

20:58.024 --> 21:00.858
I'm having a drink
with Mr. Mar...

21:00.860 --> 21:01.860
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.028
I told you... Sal.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.330
With Sal.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.399
But we shouldn't impose

21:08.401 --> 21:09.800
any longer...
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

21:09.802 --> 21:13.070
No, you're not taking
my Gertrud.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.139
Oh, his Gertrud.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.374
(Gertrud chuckles)

21:16.376 --> 21:18.376
Sit. Join us.
(gasps)

21:18.378 --> 21:20.711
GERTRUD:
Oswald, sit.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.147
Sit, Oswald.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.216
(knocking on door)

21:28.687 --> 21:29.854
Hello.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.656
I'm Bruce Wayne.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.557
Barbara Kean.
Oh.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.493
Selina never said
you're who she's staying with.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.595
Detective Gordon spoke of you.

21:37.597 --> 21:41.032
Well, Selina can be
a little guarded.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.767
(chuckles)
Yes, I know.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.935
Stop talking about me.

21:50.175 --> 21:52.610
Selina.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.846
You look very nice.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.615
The shoes hurt.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.184
Have fun.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.453
BARBARA:
Look for me at the ball.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.889
It was nice meeting you.

22:07.959 --> 22:10.027
Think she's here?

22:13.732 --> 22:16.801
(echoing):
Miss Van Groot!

22:16.803 --> 22:19.036
GCPD!

22:19.038 --> 22:21.839
I need to say this
is not exactly legal.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.375
We're running out of time.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.677
(clanking, man gasping)

22:26.679 --> 22:29.046
(gagging)

22:29.048 --> 22:30.114
GORDON: Over here.

22:38.957 --> 22:41.325
(man grunts, gasps)

22:41.327 --> 22:43.227
Oh!

22:43.229 --> 22:44.829
He's good.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.698
Call it in. I'm gonna go check
the rest of the house.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.377
(weakly):
He told me...

22:59.379 --> 23:01.779
but I was too slow.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.014
(doors creaking)

23:05.217 --> 23:06.617
Hello?

23:11.256 --> 23:13.324
Miss van Groot?

23:15.727 --> 23:17.795
I'm a police officer.

23:19.798 --> 23:21.866
Miss van Groot?

23:39.184 --> 23:40.317
Ugh...!

23:40.319 --> 23:42.386
(distant):
Gordon!

23:43.422 --> 23:45.556
Now!

23:49.094 --> 23:50.861
Jim Gordon,

23:50.863 --> 23:52.930
Constance van Groot.

24:06.845 --> 24:08.913
(classical music playing,
indistinct conversations)

24:15.554 --> 24:18.722
(indistinct chatter,
light laughter)

24:20.392 --> 24:22.326
Everyone's staring at us.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.396
Well, I am Bruce Wayne.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.799
Well, I am.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.968
Anyway, I don't
see Bunderslaw anywhere.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.804
He's probably not coming.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.407
But he's on
the guest list.

24:36.409 --> 24:37.875
Just keep dancing.

35:31.063 --> 35:32.896
You do work for
Wayne Enterprises, don't you?

35:32.898 --> 35:33.898
I do.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.266
I'm the Director
of Physical Operations.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.268
Which, I'm afraid,
is a bit dull.

35:38.270 --> 35:41.138
There are many much more
interesting people here.

35:41.140 --> 35:44.341
Ah, yes, well, I'm sure I'll get
to meet everyone, eventually.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.376
If you'll forgive me, Bruce,

35:46.378 --> 35:47.677
I have an early
flight tomorrow.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.179
It's been a pleasure.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.548
It was, um...

35:51.550 --> 35:53.717
it was nice meeting you.

35:58.356 --> 35:59.422
SELINA:
Sorry.

36:01.492 --> 36:02.559
(Bruce sighs)

36:05.363 --> 36:06.930
See?

36:06.932 --> 36:08.298
Nothin' to it.

36:14.205 --> 36:16.506
What is it?

36:20.545 --> 36:22.312
Nothing.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.381
(siren wails in distance)

36:32.423 --> 36:34.191
Stop right there, buster!

36:34.193 --> 36:35.926
(car door opens)

36:35.928 --> 36:38.094
Riddle Man?

36:38.096 --> 36:41.097
What the hell are you doing,
creeping around here?

36:41.099 --> 36:43.567
You need to leave
Miss Kringle alone.

36:43.569 --> 36:44.569
What?!

36:44.570 --> 36:47.837
I'm not gonna
let you hurt her.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.140
Ever again.

36:50.142 --> 36:52.042
I think you need
to leave Gotham...

36:52.044 --> 36:53.810
tonight.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.879
(chuckling)

36:56.814 --> 36:59.249
I get it now.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.117
You got a thing for my girl.

37:02.787 --> 37:04.821
That's too funny.

37:07.191 --> 37:09.292
Don't take this personal.

37:09.294 --> 37:12.195
(yells in pain)

37:12.197 --> 37:14.264
Aw... (scoffing laugh)

37:14.266 --> 37:15.966
You want some more?

37:17.201 --> 37:19.236
Upsi-daisy... oh!

37:20.638 --> 37:23.073
Oh, dear.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.676
(gasps)

37:32.483 --> 37:37.487
(grunting)

37:39.790 --> 37:41.625
(train clacking)

37:41.627 --> 37:43.326
Riddle Man...

37:44.562 --> 37:46.162
Oh, dear.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.798
Oh, dear.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.966
Oh, no.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.969
(gasping, laughing)

37:57.541 --> 37:58.875
Oh, dear.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.944
(laughing)

38:03.047 --> 38:04.214
(gasps)

38:04.216 --> 38:05.415
Oh, dear.

38:07.251 --> 38:08.752
Oh, dear...

38:17.962 --> 38:19.129
Oswald.

38:19.131 --> 38:20.830
Feeling better?

38:20.832 --> 38:23.266
I made tea.
(laughs)

38:23.268 --> 38:24.768
I'm afraid you had...

38:24.770 --> 38:26.636
well... (laughs)

38:26.638 --> 38:28.038
a little too much to drink.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.006
Mr. Maroni, he...

38:30.008 --> 38:32.342
he has a strange
sense of humor...

38:32.344 --> 38:34.210
Oswald...

38:34.212 --> 38:37.047
I am not some bumpkin
from the country,

38:37.049 --> 38:38.748
with hay in my brains!

38:38.750 --> 38:40.116
No...

38:40.118 --> 38:42.152
I am your mother...

38:42.154 --> 38:45.689
and I will love you,
no matter what.

38:45.691 --> 38:50.226
But lie to me now...

38:50.228 --> 38:52.962
you will break my heart.

38:54.532 --> 38:57.334
Oswald...

38:57.336 --> 39:01.838
have you done things...

39:01.840 --> 39:03.640
you should not?

39:04.975 --> 39:06.209
I...

39:08.379 --> 39:10.413
Mother...

39:10.415 --> 39:12.115
I'm a nightclub owner.

39:13.818 --> 39:15.251
That's all.

39:15.253 --> 39:16.553
(shuddering breaths)

39:16.555 --> 39:18.321
(sighs)

39:20.958 --> 39:22.959
(shuddering breaths)

39:25.830 --> 39:27.564
I'm tired now.

39:29.066 --> 39:31.134
I'm tired.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.941
(crying quietly)

39:39.543 --> 39:40.610
(sobs)

39:44.315 --> 39:46.383
(knocking on door)

39:48.686 --> 39:51.554
(Oswald sniffles,
knocking continues)

39:55.192 --> 39:57.727
Yeah, I got a delivery
for Gertrud, from Sal.

39:57.729 --> 39:58.995
Tip's not included.

40:00.164 --> 40:02.565
You tell Sal it's over.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.067
The guns are bought.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.503
The killing room
is waiting.

40:06.505 --> 40:09.639
He doesn't know it,
but he's a dead man.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.282
On second thought...

40:19.284 --> 40:20.850
I'll tell him myself.

40:21.485 --> 40:23.219
(delivery man groans)

40:27.558 --> 40:29.392
(gasping)

40:29.394 --> 40:31.795
GERTRUD:
O-Oswald?

40:31.797 --> 40:33.229
Who was that?

40:33.231 --> 40:36.299
It's Mr. Yatsko,
from next door.

40:36.301 --> 40:38.601
He needs help
taking out some trash.

40:38.603 --> 40:41.571
You, you... please,
you help him, then.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.045
(broken glass clinking)

40:50.614 --> 40:51.848
Jason van Groot?

40:51.850 --> 40:53.850
His real name is
Jason Skolimski.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.419
He used the old woman's name
when he went to the clinic.

40:56.421 --> 40:58.221
But there's no Jason van Groot
or Skolimski in Gotham.

40:58.223 --> 40:59.223
The guy's a ghost.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.490
So, the old woman

41:00.492 --> 41:02.425
rejects him,
he goes to the doctor,

41:02.427 --> 41:03.793
gets himself a pretty new face.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.628
That's where
he runs into the nurse.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.363
And we're off to the races.

41:07.365 --> 41:08.765
I don't suppose
you got a picture.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.700
Missing from the file.
No surprise there.

41:10.702 --> 41:13.136
But the good doctor
was kind enough

41:13.138 --> 41:14.337
to do a sketch.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.406
It's been ten years
since he last saw him,

41:16.408 --> 41:17.407
but at least it's a start.

41:17.409 --> 41:18.675
So we have his real name,

41:18.677 --> 41:20.276
but not what alias he's using,

41:20.278 --> 41:22.712
or what he looks like beyond
a decade-old sketch.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.949
Did he say anything else
on the phone today?

41:25.951 --> 41:28.051
Anything we might've missed?

41:28.053 --> 41:30.220
GORDON: Nah, just
warned me to back off.

41:30.222 --> 41:32.055
Told me not
to believe my own press

41:32.057 --> 41:34.457
as the rising star
of the GCPD.

41:38.028 --> 41:40.063
What is it?

41:40.065 --> 41:42.665
The paper that said that...

41:42.667 --> 41:45.001
They ran an old photo of me,
from a charity gala.

41:46.637 --> 41:47.871
I wasn't alone.

41:55.846 --> 41:58.147
(pounding on door)

41:58.149 --> 42:00.717
GORDON (muffled):
Barbara!

42:00.719 --> 42:01.719
Is Barbara here?

42:01.720 --> 42:03.386
No. Why?

42:03.388 --> 42:04.721
Where is she?

42:04.723 --> 42:06.656
When's the last time
you saw her?
At the Wayne Ball.

42:06.658 --> 42:07.957
She left with some guy.

42:09.393 --> 42:10.894
Was this the guy?

42:10.896 --> 42:12.395
It's kind of a crappy drawing.

42:12.397 --> 42:13.930
(firmly):
Was this the guy?

42:16.734 --> 42:18.401
Yeah, I think so.

42:18.403 --> 42:20.336
Why?

42:20.338 --> 42:21.471
Who is he?

42:31.882 --> 42:33.449
What's through there?

42:34.418 --> 42:35.785
See for yourself.
