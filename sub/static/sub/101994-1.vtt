01:17.826 --> 01:19.677
In between breath,

01:21.036 --> 01:22.568
take the shot.

01:47.573 --> 01:48.837
That was...

01:48.862 --> 01:53.469
I was hoping we wouldn't have to deal
with this scenario so early in our lessons.

01:54.010 --> 01:56.671
There is unfinished
business you need to tend to.

01:58.276 --> 02:01.036
It's tempting to let nature
run its course.

02:01.581 --> 02:03.778
Lungs will fill with blood.

02:04.716 --> 02:08.567
Animals die of natural death
but with that process

02:08.592 --> 02:10.184
comes extreme pain.

02:11.427 --> 02:13.888
This isn't right to let
an animal suffer for a...

02:18.019 --> 02:19.151
Hey.

02:21.457 --> 02:22.770
Zoe.

02:25.426 --> 02:26.161
Here.

02:27.007 --> 02:28.070
Let me help you.

03:05.299 --> 03:08.330
Slow down honey, it's not a race.

03:14.424 --> 03:15.596
Isn't it?

03:18.610 --> 03:21.173
Aren't we getting close
to seeing your prom?

03:21.892 --> 03:23.024
Mom.

03:23.079 --> 03:25.985
- You have anyone in your sights?
- I mean it. Stop.

03:26.010 --> 03:27.126
Stop what?

03:29.959 --> 03:32.637
Was just talking to a... fly.

03:33.608 --> 03:35.796
You've done really good out there, kid.

03:35.821 --> 03:39.219
I mean, the size of that deer,
we're gonna be eating venison all summer.

03:39.244 --> 03:41.383
- All in a days work.
- Yeah.

03:42.094 --> 03:44.149
And all before 0800.

03:47.469 --> 03:48.477
Yeah.

03:49.124 --> 03:50.352
Coffee.

04:04.006 --> 04:05.678
Hey, Lewis can wait a minute, huh?

04:05.703 --> 04:06.708
For what?

04:09.210 --> 04:11.312
I think we need to see somebody again.

04:12.374 --> 04:13.858
And by we, you mean me?

04:13.883 --> 04:15.968
No, I mean us. Listen.

04:15.993 --> 04:19.685
Everyday still feels like
it just happened.

04:20.992 --> 04:23.046
And honey, you are so angry.

04:23.209 --> 04:24.349
You are so...

04:24.873 --> 04:26.123
- not!
- Hey.

04:26.545 --> 04:27.920
That look in your eyes.

04:28.318 --> 04:30.037
Guys in my unit had that look.

04:30.099 --> 04:31.912
Not everything is about the war.

04:33.270 --> 04:35.435
You're cutting yourself off

04:35.818 --> 04:37.742
from everything you care about.

04:38.926 --> 04:40.420
And you're so guarded all the time--

04:40.561 --> 04:43.159
Maybe there's a brochure
you can give me so I can go?

04:43.665 --> 04:46.553
You're 17 years old
and you gave up your cell phone?

04:46.578 --> 04:48.360
Well, think of all the money you've saved.

04:48.415 --> 04:50.407
Take off my jacket.

04:51.977 --> 04:53.902
You go out into the word

04:55.149 --> 04:56.897
without that jacket.

04:58.849 --> 05:02.043
Should be easy for you
if you're really not at war.

05:04.313 --> 05:07.053
Sorry, not breaking, just entering.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.235
- I did knock.
- Yeah. It's cool.

05:12.132 --> 05:13.654
I'm ready.

05:16.521 --> 05:17.323
Lewis.

05:17.433 --> 05:19.551
- Morning, Mr. Hull.
- Morning.

05:22.555 --> 05:27.376
You know, back there with your Dad
I totally saved you intentionally.

05:27.603 --> 05:28.840
You intentionally saved me?

05:28.982 --> 05:31.281
Oh yeah. I mean
it was a calculated risk, but...

05:31.446 --> 05:32.920
Really? Explain.

05:33.627 --> 05:35.324
Well, number one:

05:35.989 --> 05:38.395
you were saying how things
are getting more and more heated

05:38.431 --> 05:40.014
between you and your pops lately.

05:40.391 --> 05:41.772
And "B". You know you were...

05:41.857 --> 05:43.844
You started with numbers but continue.

05:45.627 --> 05:46.958
And two:

05:47.332 --> 05:49.054
you usually come out
right when I honk,

05:49.202 --> 05:52.873
but when you didn't, I assumed
that maybe he had you cornered and so...

05:52.987 --> 05:54.902
I engaged.

05:55.979 --> 05:56.999
You engaged?

05:57.132 --> 06:00.061
- I mean that's how he would say it, right?
- You engaged, yeah.

06:02.565 --> 06:03.955
What the hell?

06:05.371 --> 06:07.795
Rory Mocun, Chaz Harting.

06:08.889 --> 06:11.918
And AJ Turners in the back,
like an asshole casserole.

06:12.541 --> 06:14.497
They're like roaming soldiers

06:14.630 --> 06:18.194
who don't realize that their empire
is crumbling in just a few days.

06:18.342 --> 06:21.568
Or they do realize it
and they are totally freaking out.

06:28.262 --> 06:31.495
Okay, that just like, looks like
one of their faces.

06:32.050 --> 06:33.367
Hello!

06:34.698 --> 06:36.915
You freaks fucking or what?

06:39.206 --> 06:41.791
Hey, we know that you're hurting, Roy.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.897
OK? We know Mommy,
she didn't hug you enough.

06:45.111 --> 06:47.430
And Daddy never said he was proud.

06:47.892 --> 06:52.253
We don't need to hide behind
stereotypical cave male aggression.

06:52.486 --> 06:54.690
We reach out to that
scared little boy inside,

06:54.714 --> 06:55.736
don't push him away.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.087
They are actually pushing us
off the road now.

07:00.610 --> 07:02.273
Thanks guys. Stay well.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.940
Why am I always this guy, huh?

07:09.020 --> 07:11.338
Guy who pulls into the dirt...

07:12.663 --> 07:14.568
Because you're smart and safe.

07:14.584 --> 07:16.239
- Yeah, well...
- And not a total asshole.

07:16.386 --> 07:17.765
I hate that about me.

07:27.241 --> 07:28.781
Is that Chris Jelick over there?

07:28.915 --> 07:31.275
Is he doing something
completely fucking weird?

07:31.398 --> 07:32.838
- Yeah.
- Then yes.

07:36.597 --> 07:38.658
It's fine, just let it rest a minute.

07:44.519 --> 07:46.502
Yeah, now, that's Chris Jelick.

07:46.546 --> 07:49.749
'Cause that is definitely
Tristan Voy's rapemobile.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.609
We'll see all kinds of dumb stuff today.

07:52.709 --> 07:53.628
What do you mean?

07:53.815 --> 07:55.581
Hello? Senior prank day.

07:56.269 --> 08:00.379
So the swim captain
will have Thai food delivered to class

08:00.455 --> 08:03.397
and Becky Vaughn will set up her home-made
slip'n'slide near the auditorium.

08:03.422 --> 08:06.651
And someone with a tiny car
will try to park it inside the lobby.

08:08.253 --> 08:11.650
God, and even stupider
turn of promposals.

08:12.776 --> 08:14.827
Yeah. Yeah. I know. Right.

08:15.246 --> 08:16.089
Ew.

08:25.479 --> 08:27.646
- You can try it now.
- What? Like..?

08:28.055 --> 08:28.855
The engine.

08:29.379 --> 08:31.126
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

08:41.414 --> 08:43.988
Okay, what is this, middle school?

08:44.736 --> 08:45.893
Fuck.

08:51.020 --> 08:52.384
This is bullshit.

08:58.045 --> 09:00.159
Giant person. When I'm in pictures.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.333
Even though I'm actually really small.
But no one needs to know that.

09:03.387 --> 09:04.238
Bye now.

09:04.287 --> 09:05.726
Wait. Where are you going?

09:06.372 --> 09:07.650
Your locker is this way.

09:07.796 --> 09:10.507
Yeah, I know where my locker's at.
Didn't you hear the bell?

09:10.972 --> 09:14.761
Your locker is by the Yearbook office
and I need your eye for some new layouts.

09:14.812 --> 09:17.596
- Okay, can it wait till after lunch?
- Yeah, of course.

09:20.835 --> 09:23.535
- You're being really weird.
- I'm just stressed out.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.053
Maybe I should've never agreed
to edit the damn thing--

09:26.153 --> 09:28.978
Okay, look. Just remember, Lewis,
this is High School.

09:29.255 --> 09:32.144
Nothing that happens here
matters in the real world. Got it?

09:32.229 --> 09:34.431
- Yeah.
- Good. I'll see you later.

09:35.162 --> 09:36.638
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:44.531 --> 09:46.264
Yo, tell me if this sucks.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.036
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

09:51.646 --> 09:53.646
- Who's harmonizing with you?
- Also me.

09:53.924 --> 09:55.340
I got a new track out.

10:00.606 --> 10:02.954
I want this played at my funeral.

10:04.136 --> 10:05.990
- We're recording EP this summer.
- No way!

10:06.015 --> 10:08.542
Yeah, I'll give the gym a shot
before reality kicks me in the cootch.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.221
Nice. You know I'll come cheer you on.

10:11.246 --> 10:14.295
How else can I justify
my 50% as your manager?

10:14.603 --> 10:15.837
- 50%?
- 50%.

10:15.911 --> 10:18.358
Is there a lawyer in here?
Are you a lawyer? Are you a lawyer?

10:18.446 --> 10:23.106
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am not in the best of moods.

10:23.663 --> 10:24.601
Okay?

10:24.736 --> 10:28.620
I have not had my morning coffee
because the teacher's lounge

10:28.951 --> 10:32.218
was filled from floor to ceiling
with balloons.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.827
Ha. Ha. Ha.

10:33.896 --> 10:35.427
Get it out of your system.

10:35.462 --> 10:38.051
All right now, the rest of the time
that we'll spend here together

10:38.147 --> 10:40.046
let's actually try and learn something.

10:40.093 --> 10:41.791
So, should we open up our books at page

10:41.891 --> 10:43.348
- One twenty...
- Freeze, scholar.

10:44.187 --> 10:47.609
Whatever it is just make it quick please.
Thank you.

10:49.475 --> 10:53.377
My maiden, will thou accompany me
to the promenade?

10:53.459 --> 10:55.256
- Yes!
- Huzzah!

10:57.063 --> 10:58.930
Very cute. We all have dates.

10:58.955 --> 11:01.175
Now let's shimmer down
and get back to business.

11:02.790 --> 11:03.778
Okay.

11:04.117 --> 11:06.338
That was pure oxygen.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.629
Makes a loud noise, right?

11:08.942 --> 11:11.245
But no flame, or heat.

11:13.349 --> 11:15.083
This balloon however

11:16.068 --> 11:20.202
is filled with 100% hydrogen.

11:25.781 --> 11:27.792
And an explosion of that type.

11:27.849 --> 11:31.137
Because all three
combustion requirements were present.

11:31.436 --> 11:32.793
Flame from the match.

11:33.074 --> 11:35.011
Oxygen from the atmosphere.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.308
And fuel from the...

11:39.456 --> 11:40.613
hydrogen.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.990
Zoe, can I have a word with you, please?

11:47.968 --> 11:49.280
Thank you, Mrs. C.

11:54.334 --> 11:55.405
Okay.

11:56.314 --> 11:58.670
Listen, I know
you've been going through a lot.

11:58.813 --> 12:02.401
But maybe getting involved again
could feel good?

12:03.561 --> 12:05.459
You want me to explode next time?

12:06.286 --> 12:09.630
I just don't like seeing
a bright young woman

12:09.659 --> 12:13.064
who used to love my class
fade into the background.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.929
No, I'm about to graduate
and leave all of this behind.

12:16.185 --> 12:17.956
I've been accepted to Purdue
for the fall--

12:17.971 --> 12:20.877
Yes, I remember.
I wrote a glowing recommendation.

12:21.579 --> 12:23.506
Perhaps that was premature?

12:24.685 --> 12:26.018
Perhaps it was.

12:27.407 --> 12:30.811
But like everyone keeps telling me,
Mrs. Crawford,

12:31.786 --> 12:33.490
you can't change the past.

12:36.450 --> 12:37.919
<i>Your attention please.</i>

12:38.396 --> 12:41.316
<i>Band practice will not be held
in the auditorium today</i>

12:41.454 --> 12:44.288
<i>but will instead move to room 112.</i>

12:44.691 --> 12:45.833
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:58.681 --> 13:02.112
<i>Roses are Red. Violets are Blue.
You didn't ask me, so I'm asking you. Prom?</i>

13:14.470 --> 13:18.522
"We believe we can change things
in accordance with our desires.

13:18.609 --> 13:22.340
We believe it because otherwise
we'd see no favorable outcome.

13:22.761 --> 13:26.085
We don't think of the outcome
which generally comes to pass,

13:26.198 --> 13:30.270
that we do not succeed in changing things
in accordance with our desires,

13:30.360 --> 13:33.218
but gradually our desires change.

13:33.405 --> 13:37.302
The situation that we hoped to change
becomes unimportant to us.

13:37.358 --> 13:41.459
We've failed to surmount the
obstacle but life took us around it,

13:41.584 --> 13:43.382
and led us beyond it,

13:43.664 --> 13:46.057
and if we turn the gaze into the past

13:46.346 --> 13:51.287
we can barely see it,
so imperceptible has it become."

13:55.245 --> 13:57.146
How cool is that?

13:58.218 --> 14:02.775
And when Marcel Proust
finally finished this novel in 1922

14:03.312 --> 14:05.963
he died, the very same day.

14:07.878 --> 14:09.868
Nothing? Okay.

14:09.892 --> 14:10.876
OK.

14:11.687 --> 14:12.823
Hello.

14:12.934 --> 14:14.096
What time is this?

14:14.778 --> 14:16.189
All right. Cool.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.288
If you could bring me a note, okay?

14:20.333 --> 14:22.436
It's a Countywide Policy,
just bring me a note from the doctor.

14:22.491 --> 14:24.764
Hey, what time does your lunch start?

14:25.352 --> 14:26.999
- Directly  after at lunch.
- Very cool.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.421
- 12:35.
- Very cool. Cool.

14:30.413 --> 14:33.070
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Yeah.

14:35.245 --> 14:36.869
Yes, ma'am, I'm listening.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.226
How is the pizza?

14:47.153 --> 14:49.153
Have you ever eaten a dryer sheet?

14:49.678 --> 14:51.110
Gross.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.459
Okay.

15:05.003 --> 15:08.749
Okay, so I'm thinking you've been
to your locker and you're taking it wrong.

15:08.893 --> 15:10.003
How should I take it?

15:10.168 --> 15:13.118
Like a goof,
like a light-hearted friend thing.

15:13.436 --> 15:15.778
We'll go and will make fun of people
together.

15:15.854 --> 15:17.573
Is that your dream prom night?

15:17.612 --> 15:21.440
You wanna spend
money on a limo and tux

15:21.465 --> 15:24.908
and the wrist flower thingy

15:24.986 --> 15:27.010
just to do what we do every day?

15:27.166 --> 15:29.384
You pay for your own thingy, but...

15:39.569 --> 15:41.991
- Forget it. You're right.
- I just... I can't.

15:42.758 --> 15:46.692
Yes. It'd be too soon and
you know, I don't wanna...

15:46.781 --> 15:47.493
What?

15:47.516 --> 15:49.820
You know like with your mom
and everything we should just--

15:49.889 --> 15:51.728
This isn't about my mom.

15:53.671 --> 15:56.012
God, why do you have
to do this right now?

15:56.483 --> 15:58.546
You were the only good thing,
Lewis, it's so--

15:58.681 --> 16:00.648
You're not being with
everyone else. Alright?

16:00.672 --> 16:02.414
Don't shut up on
me too. I was just...

16:04.654 --> 16:07.434
- You think I'm shut down?
- No.

16:09.567 --> 16:12.278
Yes, but it's like it's not your fault.
You're just...

16:12.583 --> 16:14.640
- Jesus! Dammit!
- I'm sorry.

16:15.324 --> 16:17.555
Look, this is all like coming sideways.
Can you just...

16:17.634 --> 16:19.351
I'm just going to the bathroom.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.571
When you come back can we
just hit refresh and pretend I don't

16:22.735 --> 16:24.063
suck.

16:56.050 --> 16:58.115
Hey, did you lose something in here?

16:58.186 --> 16:59.235
Shit.

16:59.781 --> 17:02.431
Hey, you got studs on, girlfriend.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.073
Bitch.

17:15.354 --> 17:17.494
That did not look like a win, bro.

17:17.634 --> 17:20.009
Hey, no. Don't sit there.
She's coming right back.

17:20.065 --> 17:22.233
- So I'm friends with your ma?
- Just leave.

17:22.325 --> 17:24.993
Hey, I'm Switzerland.
Don't take it out on me.

17:25.097 --> 17:28.601
Look, we're right in the middle of it.
All right? Just go. Go!

17:29.410 --> 17:30.385
Fine.

17:30.933 --> 17:33.241
My mom's gonna want
all those fake flowers back.

17:34.118 --> 17:35.308
And the ribbon too.

18:07.350 --> 18:09.409
Little rough on him, weren't you?

18:10.503 --> 18:12.149
It's a boundary issue.

18:12.772 --> 18:13.999
I agree.

18:14.217 --> 18:16.568
You have way too many.

18:24.013 --> 18:25.370
I like Lewis.

18:26.209 --> 18:28.319
Don't wanna lead him on,
end up hurting him.

18:29.489 --> 18:32.119
He's just trying to make
a memory with you, sweetie.

18:36.956 --> 18:38.979
I'm so closed to getting out of here.

18:40.509 --> 18:42.011
Few more months.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.067
One thing about going places.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.964
You take yourself there too.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.251
Will you go to prom with me?

19:08.393 --> 19:09.557
- Yes!
- Yeah?

19:11.869 --> 19:13.025
No way!

19:13.658 --> 19:14.970
Fuck you!

19:37.361 --> 19:38.687
No. Please! Please!

19:55.567 --> 19:56.909
Trigger warning.

19:57.717 --> 19:58.651
Hey!

20:02.159 --> 20:04.863
- Fuck you, bastard!
- Oh, slow down, old man.

20:08.144 --> 20:09.384
How's that for a coach?

20:17.841 --> 20:19.156
Son of a...

20:21.041 --> 20:22.013
Great.

20:22.276 --> 20:24.339
- You know what to do, right?
- Don't worry.

20:38.534 --> 20:39.381
What the...

20:40.208 --> 20:40.919
Wait. Wait!

20:41.291 --> 20:44.002
Okay. I got you. I got you.

20:44.208 --> 20:44.980
I got you.

20:45.134 --> 20:47.075
Oh my God. Amy?

20:47.688 --> 20:48.439
Amy?

20:51.234 --> 20:52.178
Help!

20:52.200 --> 20:53.293
Oh my God!

20:54.690 --> 20:56.211
No. No! Oh My God! No. No.

20:56.282 --> 20:57.362
You're gonna be okay.

20:57.427 --> 20:59.200
Look at me. You're gonna be okay.

21:01.879 --> 21:02.766
No.

21:07.963 --> 21:09.123
Go fuck yourself!

21:10.198 --> 21:13.072
<i>Fred Giland if you're in the building
call the main office.</i>

21:13.651 --> 21:15.781
<i>Fred Giland please call the office.</i>

21:23.984 --> 21:25.327
All right, listen up.

21:25.396 --> 21:26.569
And, uh...

21:27.193 --> 21:29.133
all of you just might survive, okay?

21:29.267 --> 21:31.756
We are in charge now, so please

21:32.502 --> 21:36.005
just do as we say quickly
and without questions or else...

21:37.288 --> 21:38.340
Well, you know...

21:46.341 --> 21:48.876
Hey, Roy. How you doin'?

21:49.487 --> 21:50.525
You know normally you...

21:50.971 --> 21:52.863
You call me a faggot when
I see you in the halls.

21:52.888 --> 21:55.182
That's kinda our thing.

22:00.359 --> 22:01.838
Who's the fag now, man?

22:06.491 --> 22:08.381
I was just messing with him. Okay?

22:08.442 --> 22:10.112
- He disrespected you.
- Look at me!

22:11.824 --> 22:13.774
We need to keep our eyes
on the price. Okay?

22:13.907 --> 22:16.265
We don't have time
for small kills please. Okay?

22:16.815 --> 22:17.964
Thank you.

22:21.742 --> 22:22.794
What the fuck?

22:23.054 --> 22:24.043
Hey!

22:24.622 --> 22:25.754
Get down on the ground!

22:25.888 --> 22:26.878
Okay. Okay.

22:27.897 --> 22:29.854
Anymore friends back there?

22:30.527 --> 22:31.523
Run.

23:21.597 --> 23:24.552
Now if I were you, and thank God I'm not,

23:25.430 --> 23:27.041
I would wanna to pull out my phone.

23:27.423 --> 23:28.500
Guess what?

23:29.010 --> 23:31.695
All out. It's okay. Please.
Pull them out. Anybody.

23:34.850 --> 23:36.179
Donna? Right? Donna?

23:36.279 --> 23:37.798
- Dwan.
- Dwan?

23:38.273 --> 23:39.796
Please don't hurt me.

23:40.288 --> 23:43.462
Dwan, do you have a phone?

23:47.447 --> 23:48.467
Okay.

23:51.899 --> 23:55.346
It's okay. Relax.
Dwan. Dwan. Relax.

23:56.096 --> 23:57.276
It's okay.

23:59.066 --> 24:01.940
- It's yours, keep it.
- No. I don't want your phone, Dwan.

24:02.287 --> 24:04.828
I want you to have your phone.
That's the point. Please.

24:06.534 --> 24:07.741
Thank you.

24:09.642 --> 24:12.999
Now who in this world
would you most like to know

24:13.099 --> 24:15.389
that today could be
the day that you die?

24:27.549 --> 24:30.352
Hey, chief. We got another one.

24:30.839 --> 24:31.920
Across town.

24:32.107 --> 24:35.814
All right. Let's splendor that truck off
and send it on over.

24:38.638 --> 24:40.027
Mom, it's me.

24:40.309 --> 24:42.302
- <i>I thought you're at school.</i>
- I am at school.

24:42.450 --> 24:44.323
<i>We talked about this, Dawn, you know--</i>

24:45.020 --> 24:48.072
No, listen mom,
there's guy with guns everywhere.

24:55.672 --> 24:57.468
He wanted me to call you.

24:58.386 --> 25:00.920
- <i>I'm calling the police.</i>
- I gotta go, mom.

25:01.343 --> 25:04.576
- <i>I love you.</i>
- I love you too.

25:05.435 --> 25:06.738
I love you.

25:08.434 --> 25:11.704
Okay, Dwan, did you mom say
that she was gonna call the police?

25:13.157 --> 25:14.611
Look at me. Look at me.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.284
It's okay if she did.

25:17.473 --> 25:18.542
Did she?

25:19.911 --> 25:21.060
Yeah?

25:22.412 --> 25:23.796
She's a good mom.

25:24.377 --> 25:27.347
Fantastic, that's one last step
for all of you to worry about.

25:27.496 --> 25:31.129
All right? Now pull out your phone,
call your parents, text your friends.

25:31.229 --> 25:33.187
Call our congresswoman.
I don't care. All right?

25:33.287 --> 25:34.641
Just get them out, please.

25:55.428 --> 25:56.566
Damn it.

25:59.846 --> 26:03.061
<i>- Hi, this is Julie. Have a blessed day.</i>
- Oh my God.

26:07.179 --> 26:10.110
If this is the last time
you hear my voice

26:10.386 --> 26:12.135
I want you to know...

26:13.467 --> 26:15.209
that I didn't die sad.

26:17.139 --> 26:18.923
I don't have any regrets.

26:19.263 --> 26:20.356
And...

26:22.872 --> 26:25.317
Thank you for the life
that you gave me, ma.

26:26.820 --> 26:28.823
I love you to the Moon and back.

26:42.963 --> 26:44.073
Okay.

26:54.088 --> 26:55.765
Kill whatever that is, please.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.699
I'm looking for you.

27:30.111 --> 27:31.995
I'm seeing this hole now.

27:44.108 --> 27:46.043
Knowing you must be close.

28:03.672 --> 28:06.093
I'm looking for the thing
that made that sound.

28:10.558 --> 28:12.531
<i>Brenda, honey?</i>

28:18.985 --> 28:20.921
Needing you to come out now.

28:26.797 --> 28:28.164
Here.

28:29.282 --> 28:30.616
I'm here.

28:31.906 --> 28:33.889
You should be ashamed.

28:39.353 --> 28:41.363
<i>Brenda, honey, what's happening now?</i>

28:41.894 --> 28:43.466
<i>Were those gunshots?</i>

28:44.297 --> 28:45.238
<i>Brenda?</i>

28:45.539 --> 28:47.615
Yeah, I killed that thing of yours.

28:47.862 --> 28:49.123
<i>Where's my fucking--</i>

29:22.199 --> 29:25.159
All right, kiddos. That's it. That's time.
Put your pencils down.

29:25.262 --> 29:26.485
End the calls, send the texts.

29:26.585 --> 29:29.442
Do what you gotta do but
I need your absolute silence now. Please.

29:29.487 --> 29:33.113
I promise, do you think I'm gonna
hang up on you. But I can't. I can't...

29:33.258 --> 29:35.415
Move, please. Come on. Move.

29:36.271 --> 29:37.445
Jesus.

29:38.857 --> 29:40.339
<i>Bradley? Son?</i>

29:40.530 --> 29:41.812
Hi, this is Tristan,

29:41.960 --> 29:45.283
I'm sending my thoughts and prayers
to you during this difficult time.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.766
Vernon Central High School,
how may I help you?

29:53.866 --> 29:55.896
I'm calling to help you, actually.

29:56.108 --> 29:58.554
Really? I could use some today.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.127
Aren't you cute?

30:00.317 --> 30:03.647
Okay, you have a live shooting situation
in the cafeteria.

30:07.525 --> 30:08.552
This isn't a joke, okay?

30:08.652 --> 30:11.351
There are students with weapons
in a lunch room right now.

30:11.941 --> 30:13.648
And you know this how?

30:15.979 --> 30:19.987
Because you are one of the students
in our cafeteria with a firearm?

30:20.344 --> 30:22.460
Let's get more specific. I'm Tristan Voy.

30:22.546 --> 30:24.096
And you say your name is Tristan Voy?

30:24.196 --> 30:25.045
Keep talking.

30:26.534 --> 30:27.682
You with me.

30:28.033 --> 30:30.649
What are you hoping to gain
from this, Tristan?

30:31.085 --> 30:32.775
Hope's got nothing to do with it.

30:32.849 --> 30:33.975
Thank you.

30:34.529 --> 30:36.467
He hung up. I'm calling 911.

30:49.191 --> 30:51.271
When experts look back
on this day they will agree

30:51.371 --> 30:54.589
that she should've announced lock down
over the intercom immediately.

30:55.613 --> 31:00.500
However the rule states that she must first
confirm the information.

31:02.247 --> 31:03.734
How do I know this?

31:04.646 --> 31:08.237
Because they publicly vote on this shit
at the school board meetings.

31:08.564 --> 31:09.689
That's how.

31:09.774 --> 31:12.053
Okay? So while we wait
for this ill-advised staff

31:12.228 --> 31:16.033
I want you all to pull out whichever app
you use to do live streaming video:

31:16.160 --> 31:19.174
Instagram, Facebook, Periscope.
It does not matter to me, all right?

31:19.214 --> 31:22.062
Just get them up and running
and point it at me. Now!

32:11.377 --> 32:13.389
Hey! You!

32:14.019 --> 32:15.660
- Zoe?
- All of you. Stop!

32:15.833 --> 32:17.356
- Stop! Stop!
- Hey.

32:18.601 --> 32:21.354
Tristan Voy and Chris Jelick
have guns in the cafeteria.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.314
They are killing people.

32:23.713 --> 32:25.316
It's not even funny.

32:25.740 --> 32:26.813
No shit!

32:27.098 --> 32:29.854
Don't go back inside
unless you wanna die, okay?

32:33.487 --> 32:34.432
Go!

32:34.753 --> 32:36.462
It's better be real.

32:40.702 --> 32:41.597
You are not coming?

32:41.697 --> 32:43.186
No. Most of them still don't know.

32:45.017 --> 32:46.237
Okay?

32:47.041 --> 32:48.055
I'm with you.

32:48.690 --> 32:49.474
- Okay.
- Yeah?

32:49.611 --> 32:50.904
Yeah. Come on.

32:52.118 --> 32:53.488
My name is Tristan Voy

32:53.588 --> 32:56.819
and you are watching a live take down
of Vernon Central High School.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.670
At first, I would like to give
a quick shutout

32:59.770 --> 33:02.239
to the tech giants
hosting these video streams.

33:02.390 --> 33:05.258
Turn them off, or in any way interrupt them

33:05.393 --> 33:08.220
and we will be forced
to kill everybody immediately.

33:08.555 --> 33:09.887
I promise.

33:10.752 --> 33:13.931
So join me as we dismantle
a bastion of our society

33:14.031 --> 33:16.825
in favor of entropy and truth.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.225
Well, well, well. If
it isn't our friendly

33:23.250 --> 33:25.921
old neighborhood security guard.

33:26.175 --> 33:27.845
As if it's not sad
enough that they are

33:27.869 --> 33:29.849
only paying him $12/h
to protect our school.

33:29.949 --> 33:32.114
They expect you to do it
without a fucking gun?

33:32.125 --> 33:33.570
Tristan!

33:33.996 --> 33:35.626
Oh, Jesus Christ.

33:35.706 --> 33:37.145
- Yes?
- I'm unarmed.

33:37.407 --> 33:40.448
Sure, except for your
normally cutting remarks, but please.

33:40.496 --> 33:41.475
What can I do for you?

33:41.575 --> 33:43.737
Your grievances with me,
not your classmates.

33:43.837 --> 33:46.309
No shit? Do tell. Please.

33:46.405 --> 33:48.994
You were sent to my office
twice last week.

33:49.072 --> 33:49.663
That's right.

33:49.763 --> 33:52.120
And I threatened you.
I threatened you with expulsion.

33:52.151 --> 33:53.420
That's also right.

33:53.798 --> 33:56.077
Instead of trying harder
to understand you.

33:59.959 --> 34:03.160
You know behind your desk
you have this poster, and it says:

34:03.270 --> 34:05.668
"Making a difference,
once student at a time."

34:06.664 --> 34:08.678
He didn't make time for me.

34:11.378 --> 34:13.188
I let you down, man.

34:13.473 --> 34:15.255
But you got my undivided attention now.

34:15.306 --> 34:18.159
On your desk, there's a picture of you,

34:18.782 --> 34:20.983
and your wife and your two kids.

34:21.132 --> 34:22.319
Where is that?

34:23.313 --> 34:26.317
That's at out camp in Broken Bow.

34:27.016 --> 34:29.417
I've never seen a family so happy.

34:30.085 --> 34:31.880
Made me wish
that I could have that someday.

34:31.917 --> 34:34.355
- You absolutely can!
- Wow!

34:36.260 --> 34:37.721
I can have your cabin?

34:37.853 --> 34:39.127
- Sure.
- Okay, great.

34:39.255 --> 34:41.379
- So you heard that, right?
- End this now.

34:41.638 --> 34:44.040
- And we'll make it happen.
- Everybody heard that.

34:44.989 --> 34:48.835
Perhaps I can fuck your wife on the beach
while your kids watch too, huh?

34:49.458 --> 34:50.712
You see,

34:50.735 --> 34:54.806
last week I wanted to come
to your office twice, man.

34:55.597 --> 34:57.461
During our morning session

34:57.521 --> 35:00.305
I grabbed your keys, I went downtown,
I had a copy made.

35:01.110 --> 35:03.491
And during our afternoon session

35:04.020 --> 35:05.537
while you were looking out the window

35:05.637 --> 35:07.383
talking about how guys like me
would never amount to anything.

35:07.408 --> 35:10.180
You remember that? I replaced them.

35:11.596 --> 35:13.340
- Tristan.
- Rob.

35:13.449 --> 35:17.428
Whatever your reasons are for doing this,
man, we can work it out between us.

35:20.853 --> 35:22.493
Maybe we can.

35:25.429 --> 35:26.456
No!

35:31.070 --> 35:32.146
No. Please!

35:32.179 --> 35:34.496
- Get up!
- Please!

35:38.174 --> 35:39.424
Don't bother.

35:40.079 --> 35:41.681
Phase two is about to begin.

35:48.931 --> 35:50.763
What did the Texans have?

35:50.977 --> 35:52.366
Grinding determination.

35:52.487 --> 35:54.574
But very little in a way of ammunition.

35:55.385 --> 35:57.483
What we wanna point out is...
A hundred--

35:58.051 --> 35:59.911
- You have to get out now!
- Come on!

36:00.280 --> 36:02.775
Mrs. Greene, Mrs. Greene,
you have to open the window please!

36:02.822 --> 36:04.100
- Please!
- No, no!

36:04.200 --> 36:06.367
Thank you ladies, very clever.

36:09.653 --> 36:10.777
Where was I?

36:49.104 --> 36:51.733
In the corner of your screen
there should be a number,

36:53.080 --> 36:55.255
perhaps next to an eyeball icon.

36:57.733 --> 37:01.040
Who here has more than 50
live viewers right now?

37:01.137 --> 37:02.666
Raise your hands please.

37:04.121 --> 37:08.019
Okay, great. That's great.
Who has more than 100 live viewers?

37:10.494 --> 37:12.130
500?

37:14.532 --> 37:15.952
How many do you have?

37:16.126 --> 37:17.942
Just went over a thousand.

37:19.866 --> 37:21.664
Goddamn, get up here.

37:24.612 --> 37:26.444
What makes you so popular?

37:26.544 --> 37:28.665
- I'm not, I'm--
- He does the Yearbook.

37:28.791 --> 37:30.466
Ah, the geeky newsboy.

37:30.709 --> 37:33.142
Well, actually I'm the admin
of the Vernon High Page.

37:33.242 --> 37:35.305
Look, nobody asked
for your life story, all right?

37:35.405 --> 37:37.666
I don't care where they are coming from,
as long as they are watching.

37:37.691 --> 37:40.036
You are my main camera now,
so please stay close.

37:40.061 --> 37:42.768
And everybody else please put you phone
in a bin as it comes around

37:42.846 --> 37:44.691
I have a new task for you.

37:45.869 --> 37:49.122
I need to see your work, people.
You can't just Google--

37:49.271 --> 37:50.699
Oh my God!

37:52.193 --> 37:53.962
Ms. Hull! Inappropriate!

37:54.164 --> 37:55.238
What in the name of--

37:55.338 --> 37:58.005
We're under attack. Some students
have guns in the cafeteria.

37:58.105 --> 38:00.894
- This isn't a senior prank.
- Everybody has to get out now.

38:01.578 --> 38:03.310
Josh, lock the door.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.449
Okay, come on,
we don't have much time.

38:05.529 --> 38:08.408
Okay, everyone over here now.
Single file line.

38:08.475 --> 38:09.779
- Where do I go?
- Ladies first.

38:09.879 --> 38:12.064
Into the woods.
Stay until the cops come. You're good.

38:12.365 --> 38:13.859
And make sure they're out if you can.

38:13.887 --> 38:14.947
- Single file.
- Good.

38:15.047 --> 38:15.927
Mr. Yates?

38:16.127 --> 38:16.890
Yeah.

38:16.978 --> 38:18.560
I got you. One leg at a time.

38:19.277 --> 38:20.825
Oh my Lord.

38:21.861 --> 38:25.054
- They recorded this?
- No, it's live. Happening now.

38:25.242 --> 38:27.922
- How did you find this?
- It's on the school social page.

38:28.358 --> 38:29.555
Lewis.

38:31.036 --> 38:33.074
It's not that hard to build a wall.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.411
Tristan.

38:34.578 --> 38:35.658
Coming.

38:38.437 --> 38:40.767
- Are we famous yet?
- Not yet.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.478
Okay.

38:47.495 --> 38:48.415
Yes?

38:48.581 --> 38:50.097
Permission to kill these?

38:51.585 --> 38:52.950
They're useless.

38:54.027 --> 38:56.170
Please, you've hurt her enough.

38:59.655 --> 39:02.149
Have you heard of operation T4?

39:02.461 --> 39:04.982
Hitler ordered mercy killings
on the disabled

39:05.082 --> 39:08.858
because he didn't want their deformities
to infect the master race.

39:10.212 --> 39:11.553
Good thing is...

39:11.744 --> 39:12.869
We're not Nazis.

39:13.473 --> 39:14.860
This is gonna take too long.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.555
Should I warn another class?

39:16.691 --> 39:18.277
I don't know, I just...

39:19.213 --> 39:21.715
You all right? Got this. Okay.

39:27.384 --> 39:28.605
What the hell?

39:28.767 --> 39:31.515
Relax. All right? It's early.

39:31.777 --> 39:33.215
But not unexpected.

39:34.136 --> 39:36.458
Anna, can you please
figure this out for me?

39:36.606 --> 39:38.057
- Copy that.
- Keep it moving!

39:38.169 --> 39:39.238
I'm on it.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.815
Leave it all and line up.

39:42.091 --> 39:43.072
Thank you.

39:45.489 --> 39:48.500
Isabelle, leave your purse.
It will still be here when you get back.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.002
What the hell are you doing, Missy?

40:01.868 --> 40:03.757
I think that I have a pass here somewhere.

40:03.852 --> 40:07.277
For the electrical room?
Nobody but me is allowed in it.

40:14.684 --> 40:17.367
What the hell does that mean?
Did they get to it somehow?

40:17.392 --> 40:18.531
I don't know.

40:19.979 --> 40:21.190
What's going on?

40:22.076 --> 40:23.069
Pranking?

40:23.261 --> 40:24.215
Okay.

40:24.941 --> 40:28.700
All right. False alarm everyone.
Back in your classrooms.

40:28.987 --> 40:30.688
You're not getting away that easy.

40:30.740 --> 40:32.351
Come on! You wanna die? Go!

40:32.451 --> 40:34.015
- Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

40:34.059 --> 40:35.045
Hey, what are you doing?

40:35.145 --> 40:37.457
Maybe if I can get to the office
I can make an announcement.

40:37.557 --> 40:39.598
Wait, Zoe! I should be
the one to do that.

40:43.502 --> 40:45.611
<i>Sheriff, if someone shooting
at the school--</i>

40:46.481 --> 40:49.125
You're right. If it's an active shooter
we go in immediately.

40:49.225 --> 40:50.997
<i>This fucker holds the kids at gunpoint.</i>

40:51.097 --> 40:52.648
Wait, Tom, if you telling me these kids

40:52.748 --> 40:55.146
are calling their parents
from inside the school

40:55.176 --> 40:57.178
and saying that they are being held by--

40:57.272 --> 40:59.893
I know you're not afraid to go in.
I wanna go in.

41:00.011 --> 41:01.369
But... it's just...

41:01.416 --> 41:03.679
Look, let me finish!

41:03.779 --> 41:06.960
If this is more of a hostage situation
than an active shooter

41:06.995 --> 41:08.549
then we contain, negotiate,

41:08.589 --> 41:11.028
and wait for the lead
team before all else fails.

41:16.278 --> 41:19.287
Final projects are due in a few days.

41:21.455 --> 41:23.960
Really impressed
with the work I've been seeing.

41:24.063 --> 41:25.087
Oh, Goodness.

41:25.479 --> 41:27.411
Hopefully you guys have saved your work.

41:32.888 --> 41:34.191
Get outside!

41:34.552 --> 41:37.018
Get outside! There's school shooting.
Let's go!

41:37.380 --> 41:39.225
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit. Let's go!

41:40.826 --> 41:42.031
Fuck!

42:02.219 --> 42:03.830
Fuck you, Becky!

42:04.388 --> 42:06.519
<i>Sheriff, I'm a mile away,
you can't tell me not to go in.</i>

42:06.558 --> 42:07.587
Listen to me, Tommy.

42:07.687 --> 42:10.477
If it sounds like I'm pulling rank on you
it's because I am.

42:10.526 --> 42:13.038
Now Vernon is your town
but it's my county, okay?

42:13.063 --> 42:15.138
<i>You're not the whose
with family in there.</i>

42:15.636 --> 42:18.599
Yes. I hear you, Tommy.
I know your nephew's in there.

42:18.645 --> 42:22.841
But you if you have fast an entry team
you gonna get everybody killed.

42:22.941 --> 42:26.157
Now I'm two minutes away. Just,
hold out for just a goddamn minute.

42:26.257 --> 42:28.761
We could...Tom? Tommy?

42:29.507 --> 42:30.855
Son of a bitch!

42:31.105 --> 42:32.173
He hung up?

42:32.300 --> 42:34.410
He's hellbent on going in immediately.

42:34.644 --> 42:36.977
Here. Get us
the hell outta here, will you?

42:37.535 --> 42:38.725
Let's go. Go.

42:40.141 --> 42:42.219
- Surely they all follow it.
- Yes, we see them.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.730
Okay, they're gonna keep their lights
and sirens off until we know if it's real.

42:45.830 --> 42:47.470
- It's real.
- Okay.

42:47.976 --> 42:51.079
We have confirmation. There are
active shooters in the building.

42:51.243 --> 42:52.770
They killed Rob.

42:53.977 --> 42:56.369
Yes. I'm here. I just... I need to...

42:56.411 --> 42:58.972
make a lock down announcement
as quickly as possible?

42:59.603 --> 43:01.819
Yes, we'll keep the line open.
Take this.

43:02.354 --> 43:03.356
Okay.

43:05.202 --> 43:06.765
Attention, faculty and students.

43:06.809 --> 43:09.503
We are in lock down.
I repeat we are in lock down.

43:09.749 --> 43:12.857
Please just follow your school
safety manuals for instructions

43:12.882 --> 43:16.024
as we put it in the lock down
until further notice. Thank you.

43:18.871 --> 43:21.727
Officer, is there anything else
we should be doing right now?

43:25.206 --> 43:26.692
Hey, you need to slow down!

43:27.147 --> 43:29.903
I'm not the problem, okay?
They are at the cafeteria.

43:30.002 --> 43:31.082
We know that!

43:31.152 --> 43:33.345
Get back to your home room
and stay put until--

43:36.133 --> 43:37.346
Oh, shit.

43:38.066 --> 43:39.518
Fuck. Guys, everyone all right?

43:39.606 --> 43:41.219
- Yes.
- All right. Okay. Hold on.

43:41.786 --> 43:45.164
Okay. Lock down means we stay put,
lock the door.

43:45.259 --> 43:46.959
Emma, can you lock the door please?

43:46.988 --> 43:48.181
Close the window blinds.

43:48.285 --> 43:51.178
Get against the wall that isn't in view.
Everyone go to that wall.

43:51.278 --> 43:52.075
And keep quiet.

43:52.190 --> 43:54.604
That's it. Come on in.
Keep coming. File in.

43:56.339 --> 43:59.856
Hey, we're okay. It's all right.

44:00.472 --> 44:03.213
If the office announces the lock down

44:03.522 --> 44:05.431
then they're on it.
Police have been notified.

44:05.623 --> 44:09.043
This is Tarsy. I need all available units
to Vernon Central High...

44:09.076 --> 44:11.751
- Sir! Sir!
- Good Christ!

44:13.290 --> 44:14.330
Tommy!

44:19.963 --> 44:22.413
- Tom, you read me?
- There are officers down, we need medics.

44:22.643 --> 44:26.371
Police are here. Some lady cop's
calling for an ambulance.

44:26.661 --> 44:27.755
Nice!

44:28.303 --> 44:31.144
Yes! The phase three begins. And?

44:31.165 --> 44:33.338
We just got teased on the Channel 2 News.

44:33.369 --> 44:35.193
Are they airing our stream yet?

44:35.629 --> 44:36.680
No.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.493
The anchor said
they plan to go live from out-front.

44:41.827 --> 44:43.798
Hello, this is live from inside.

44:43.831 --> 44:46.045
Nobody wants to see
your bullshit reporter.

44:46.097 --> 44:47.904
They want to see me.

44:49.223 --> 44:51.934
<i>I'm finished in the basement.
Awaiting for the orders.</i>

44:53.272 --> 44:53.937
Great work.

44:54.112 --> 44:57.298
Do some reckon on the office
on your way back. I wanna see how we did.

45:02.165 --> 45:06.237
<i>Let the sheriff know we've got
the remnants of the home-made bomb here.</i>

45:06.984 --> 45:09.811
If somebody wanted to keep us busy
and clogged the roads.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.706
Understood. I'll let him know.

45:14.938 --> 45:16.860
Williams, have you set the perimeter?

45:16.892 --> 45:19.462
Nobody does shit around here
without my say so!

45:20.851 --> 45:22.476
What the hell is going on in here?

45:22.576 --> 45:25.286
Sheriff! Sheriff!
You have to see this.

45:26.920 --> 45:29.828
All right. Come on everybody! Let's go!
Away from the school!

45:36.328 --> 45:38.436
Hey! Hey!

45:44.422 --> 45:46.311
Okay, we need to get out of here.

45:50.821 --> 45:53.114
Not as painful as it looks.

45:54.095 --> 45:55.412
In fact...

45:57.828 --> 45:59.699
When it happens fast

45:59.998 --> 46:02.091
there's often no pain at all.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.805
Suddenly you're the expert on death?

46:05.862 --> 46:07.611
You only did it once.

46:08.083 --> 46:10.553
Yes. I'm a quick study.

46:10.944 --> 46:12.790
You got that from me.

46:13.871 --> 46:14.541
Yeah.

46:14.641 --> 46:18.020
Going through people's pockets,
that you got from your dad.

46:18.384 --> 46:19.788
I need a phone.

46:21.345 --> 46:24.433
Always have known exactly
what you wanted.

46:24.822 --> 46:26.477
Even as a baby.

46:27.498 --> 46:29.094
You wanna talk pain?

46:29.421 --> 46:31.283
- Breastfeeding you was a--
- Mom.

46:31.383 --> 46:33.415
No, it was a nightmare.

46:34.024 --> 46:35.591
But I admire it.

46:38.034 --> 46:39.696
Do I close his eyes?

46:39.849 --> 46:42.277
Well, he's not here anymore, sweetie.

46:44.133 --> 46:46.676
He's free of all attachments now.

46:48.525 --> 46:49.747
Is that how you feel?

46:49.928 --> 46:51.269
Almost.

46:51.988 --> 46:54.651
I still got one person who's holding on.

46:55.692 --> 46:59.553
Someone who's not quite ready
to release me just yet.

47:05.290 --> 47:06.967
Definitely success.

47:10.268 --> 47:12.167
Maybe even better than expected.

47:15.293 --> 47:17.724
<i>Pictures are worth
a thousands words, my darling.</i>

47:17.848 --> 47:19.833
<i>And video, even more.</i>

47:31.864 --> 47:34.059
This is for stealing all my weed.

47:48.776 --> 47:51.064
<i>Begin sweeping the rooms. Top down.</i>

47:52.326 --> 47:54.982
10-4. And standby for the pics.

48:07.687 --> 48:08.805
Sit!

48:19.826 --> 48:20.912
Miss?

48:21.940 --> 48:23.571
Do you believe in God?

48:23.752 --> 48:24.957
Yes.

48:25.604 --> 48:26.791
Huh?

48:28.205 --> 48:31.904
Now why would God
let something like this happen to you?

48:36.061 --> 48:37.507
Oh, Anna.

48:40.563 --> 48:42.408
Is it just me or it's hot in here?

48:42.416 --> 48:44.653
<i>This is for stealing all my weed.</i>

49:01.327 --> 49:02.360
Nice.

49:02.385 --> 49:04.385
Free will.

49:06.857 --> 49:09.762
God allows the wicked
to do their wickedness.

49:10.774 --> 49:12.240
Oh yeah? Why is that?

49:13.452 --> 49:15.189
So they can be judged.

49:18.876 --> 49:21.244
Channel 5 just interrupted
their programming.

49:22.520 --> 49:25.255
They're warning viewers
about graphic content

49:25.358 --> 49:28.955
because they are about to air
the live stream.

49:31.209 --> 49:32.524
Hot dog.

49:35.112 --> 49:36.983
You got the con. Okay?

49:37.083 --> 49:39.835
We need more bodies
so we'll be right back.

49:39.929 --> 49:41.702
You two are coming with me.

49:41.852 --> 49:43.016
Let's move.

49:48.288 --> 49:51.150
Hey! If anyone is in there
you need to get out of there. Okay?

49:51.250 --> 49:52.759
They gonna come looking for you.

49:52.869 --> 49:55.119
Just break the window. Get out if you can.

49:55.156 --> 49:55.916
Fuck.

49:56.115 --> 49:59.285
Hey! If anyone is in there
you shouldn't hide in the rooms.

49:59.393 --> 50:00.354
They gonna come looking for you.

50:00.379 --> 50:02.849
- Are you a staff member?
- No. Hey, look.

50:04.013 --> 50:05.883
They are in the cafeteria now.

50:05.987 --> 50:09.009
But I think they wanted a lock down.

50:09.852 --> 50:12.284
And it makes it easier
to round everybody up that way.

50:12.338 --> 50:14.701
Break the window. Get out if you can.

50:14.733 --> 50:17.780
We're not supposed to leave
until the office announces that it's over.

50:17.880 --> 50:20.145
No, you don't understand.
There is no office anymore.

50:26.660 --> 50:27.827
Fuck! Fuck!

50:38.829 --> 50:39.847
Run.

50:53.841 --> 50:55.045
Hola!

50:56.477 --> 50:57.612
Don't worry amigos.

50:57.665 --> 51:00.420
For those of you just joining us
this is school shooting.

51:00.542 --> 51:01.648
Tristan?

51:01.860 --> 51:04.044
Ms. Nunez, how are you?

51:04.144 --> 51:06.766
I'm gonna need to take
everybody down to the cafeteria.

51:07.461 --> 51:09.930
<i>La cafeteria.</i> Is that right?

51:10.843 --> 51:13.183
Please don't hurt anyone.

51:17.498 --> 51:19.207
You know it's the
one thing I've always

51:19.231 --> 51:20.544
really liked about you,
Ms. Nunez, you really

51:20.586 --> 51:23.498
genuinely care about your students.

51:24.602 --> 51:26.114
Another thing I like is...

51:26.389 --> 51:28.953
You know you have this way
of turning to write on the board

51:29.053 --> 51:31.627
it really holds the young man's attention.

51:31.750 --> 51:33.035
Tristan, please don't...

51:33.127 --> 51:34.556
Hey, <i>por favor</i>!

51:35.073 --> 51:38.045
Ms. Nunez,
this is a Spanish-speaking classroom.

51:42.056 --> 51:43.486
You are beautiful.

51:45.013 --> 51:47.210
And you know what, for you...

51:48.273 --> 51:50.961
I think I can promise
that I won't hurt anybody

51:51.600 --> 51:53.709
if you can do something for me.

51:55.607 --> 51:58.400
<i>Quítate la blusa.</i>

52:26.954 --> 52:29.391
Oh my God! Let go!

52:45.928 --> 52:46.866
Let go!

52:47.198 --> 52:48.161
Fuck

52:48.403 --> 52:49.579
you!

53:03.043 --> 53:04.368
Ms. Nunez.

53:05.489 --> 53:06.894
It's okay, Kitty.

53:15.507 --> 53:17.603
What, do you think I'm a child?
Everything.

53:23.331 --> 53:24.488
Wow.

53:28.057 --> 53:30.957
You know you really are
the nicest teacher--

53:31.088 --> 53:31.983
Tristan.

53:32.284 --> 53:34.660
I have a few questions for you.

53:35.220 --> 53:37.962
I turned on the live comments feature
and it's blowing up.

53:38.027 --> 53:39.389
People are really interested in--

53:39.442 --> 53:41.640
Did I tell you to do that?

53:42.436 --> 53:44.075
- No, I'm sorry.
- No.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.972
I'll turn it off.

53:54.077 --> 53:55.879
What kind of questions are they asking?

54:22.026 --> 54:23.987
Don't wanna get your hands dirty, huh?

54:42.276 --> 54:43.620
Miss Voy!

54:48.371 --> 54:49.933
Hello!

54:54.762 --> 54:56.692
Hey, is that you
calling in on the land line?

54:56.717 --> 54:58.433
Yeah. Is there a car on the drive?

54:58.437 --> 55:01.138
It's not. There is a TV on,
but they believe ma is off the town.

55:01.164 --> 55:03.481
SWAT team's still 30 away.
They were on their way up to North

55:03.581 --> 55:06.267
responding to the bullshit bomb threats
somebody called in.

55:06.745 --> 55:08.589
These jackass look
three steps ahead of us.

55:08.614 --> 55:10.698
Look around and see
if there is a back door.

55:11.121 --> 55:12.325
Roger that.

55:12.871 --> 55:13.911
Miss Voy!

55:14.309 --> 55:16.816
He's shooting up a school
live on the internet,

55:16.841 --> 55:19.402
but giving me his number
will violet his privacy?

55:19.543 --> 55:20.723
What?

55:21.292 --> 55:22.254
Second floor plans.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.856
Hey, do we even got a warrant for this?

55:25.956 --> 55:26.960
No. No time.

55:27.164 --> 55:30.686
That's why I'm calling
what you're now doing a wellness check.

55:30.856 --> 55:32.270
Roger that.

55:32.667 --> 55:34.003
Miss Voy!

55:44.053 --> 55:45.021
Okay.

55:56.046 --> 55:58.934
<i>How long
did it take for you to plan?</i>

56:01.191 --> 56:03.134
<i>Fourteen months or so, I really...</i>

56:03.812 --> 56:05.073
<i>To make it sane.</i>

56:05.441 --> 56:07.978
<i>Between researching the blueprints
of the building,</i>

56:08.078 --> 56:10.455
<i>gathering the tech, weaponry etc.</i>

56:15.182 --> 56:17.598
How did you get the idea to do this?

56:18.487 --> 56:21.157
I didn't get the idea.

56:22.354 --> 56:24.292
So much, as the idea got me.

56:24.432 --> 56:26.588
You know, it reached out
and grabbed me by the neck.

56:26.613 --> 56:28.971
And it hasn't let go. Quite frankly.

56:33.910 --> 56:34.988
Miss Voy!

56:49.207 --> 56:52.496
<i>...we are also waiting
for a SWAT team just now en route...</i>

56:55.982 --> 56:57.599
It's officer Banks.

56:58.240 --> 57:00.372
I got eyes on Miss Voy.

57:02.326 --> 57:04.552
She ain't gonna be helping you
talk to her son.

57:10.552 --> 57:14.037
<i>Breaking in here folks
with some very disturbing news</i>

57:14.062 --> 57:16.271
<i>out of Vernon Central High School.</i>

57:16.296 --> 57:21.679
<i>There are multiple confirmed reports
of an active shooting situation.</i>

57:21.956 --> 57:25.089
<i>We know that hostages are being held...<i></i></i>

57:25.243 --> 57:26.569
Come here! Listen up!

57:26.594 --> 57:31.751
Anybody inside my perimeter
from now on must gear up, okay?

57:32.397 --> 57:34.452
We've already lost
two good officers.

57:34.477 --> 57:37.304
So tactical vest and helmets,
right now. Let's go.

57:38.319 --> 57:40.514
No, he left me in charge.

57:41.687 --> 57:43.241
Not you.

57:44.746 --> 57:46.551
No. This is my body.

57:47.090 --> 57:48.145
No.

57:48.488 --> 57:51.518
<i>From what I can tell, it looks like
they are getting ready to enter the school.</i>

57:51.618 --> 57:54.791
<i>They are armoring up, not quite sure,
but from what it looks like</i>

57:54.829 --> 57:56.789
<i>they are preparing to enter the school.</i>

57:56.904 --> 57:58.289
<i>Trunks are being opened.</i>

57:58.352 --> 58:01.153
<i>They are loading their weapons
and vests are being deployed.</i>

58:01.516 --> 58:03.828
<i>A full scale seize approach is risky</i>

58:03.853 --> 58:05.703
<i>but it could make sense from the...</i>

58:18.253 --> 58:20.402
Any reason for committing
such a violent--

58:20.502 --> 58:21.425
Shut up.

58:25.406 --> 58:28.656
Okay. You're okay.
Your vest caught it. You're okay!

58:28.961 --> 58:30.484
Let's go, Bill. Come on.

58:33.893 --> 58:35.112
Back!

58:35.299 --> 58:36.799
Chris.

58:37.088 --> 58:38.815
Christopher, answer me.

58:38.840 --> 58:39.924
Tristan?

58:40.182 --> 58:41.596
Who the fuck else would it be?

58:41.634 --> 58:43.835
They tried to escape.
I didn't kill without permission.

58:43.935 --> 58:45.537
Okay. Relax. Relax.

58:46.599 --> 58:48.286
I'm hearing the chors again...

58:48.572 --> 58:50.110
They found me here somehow.

58:50.878 --> 58:52.894
You know they aren't real. Right, buddy?

58:57.195 --> 58:58.451
Hold on. I'm coming down

58:58.475 --> 59:00.841
because apparently
I have to do everything myself.

59:00.883 --> 59:02.323
Give me your extra piece.

59:09.661 --> 59:10.708
Well.

59:13.451 --> 59:16.341
It's funny when you are holding a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

59:16.662 --> 59:19.756
Everybody to the cafeteria.
Now! Two by two, please.

59:19.851 --> 59:21.193
And we are behind.

59:21.293 --> 59:23.472
So I'm gonna take this group down,
you go collect more.

59:23.498 --> 59:26.841
We're the number 1 trending topic online.

59:27.372 --> 59:28.645
About damn time.

59:30.067 --> 59:32.856
Well, get to it!
What are you guys doing? Let's move!

59:36.799 --> 59:38.760
To the cafeteria, now!

59:42.323 --> 59:45.580
Keep the camera pointed at them.
Please. Keep it moving.

59:45.752 --> 59:48.330
One foot after the other.
Keep it moving.

01:00:12.117 --> 01:00:14.398
Find some floor. Make yourself at home.

01:00:14.423 --> 01:00:16.312
- I'm sorry.
- I know. I know.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.378
- They always try to take over.
- I know.

01:00:20.233 --> 01:00:21.561
They are gone now, right?

01:00:22.772 --> 01:00:23.834
Yes?

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:25.599
Because you're here.

01:00:25.812 --> 01:00:27.146
I'm here.

01:00:28.116 --> 01:00:30.588
No. Not right now, okay?
There is still a lot to get done.

01:00:30.688 --> 01:00:31.819
You don't love me anymore?

01:00:32.065 --> 01:00:35.904
- You've moved on my sister.
- I love you and Anna both equally. Okay?

01:00:35.959 --> 01:00:37.559
Now fucking medicate man.

01:00:37.659 --> 01:00:40.238
Get yourself together,
there's still a lot to get done.

01:00:44.454 --> 01:00:45.971
Get in. Come on.

01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:51.217
Anna. Where are you?

01:01:00.408 --> 01:01:02.851
Hey, would you please report back?
Tell me where you are.

01:01:14.382 --> 01:01:16.022
I did that, you bitch!

01:01:31.467 --> 01:01:34.009
Anna, what the fuck? Speak.

01:02:01.874 --> 01:02:03.842
Knock 'em dead, sweetie.

01:02:06.585 --> 01:02:07.538
It's...

01:02:07.852 --> 01:02:09.547
It's funny cause it's...

01:02:11.188 --> 01:02:12.695
it's a theater.

01:02:15.671 --> 01:02:16.773
Your hair.

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:18.687
Yeah.

01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:20.359
Do you like it?

01:02:23.507 --> 01:02:26.734
So, you obviously met me when you said
someone was holding you back.

01:02:28.046 --> 01:02:29.218
But you're wrong.

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:33.148
You died, there is nothing
I can do to change that.

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.263
Well.

01:02:35.895 --> 01:02:37.747
You said yourself.

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:39.927
I only died once.

01:02:40.231 --> 01:02:41.216
Right?

01:02:41.575 --> 01:02:42.552
Right.

01:02:42.966 --> 01:02:46.606
But how many times
did I die in your mind since then?

01:02:47.185 --> 01:02:50.224
How often do you think
of that day?

01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:53.763
But you don't really see me
anymore, sweetie.

01:02:54.411 --> 01:02:56.349
You just see the monster that got me.

01:02:56.374 --> 01:02:57.606
I can't help it.

01:02:58.763 --> 01:03:00.395
Well, you can.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.497
Look at me now.

01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:08.810
That deep place inside of you.

01:03:09.247 --> 01:03:12.835
Your will to live is getting stronger.

01:03:14.145 --> 01:03:16.614
And it's letting me live again too.

01:03:18.497 --> 01:03:20.935
- The way I really want.
- Jesus!

01:03:22.745 --> 01:03:25.096
You hear voices too?

01:03:25.947 --> 01:03:27.143
Maybe.

01:03:28.706 --> 01:03:30.464
What's your excuse?

01:03:33.596 --> 01:03:34.917
Really?

01:03:35.885 --> 01:03:37.104
God!

01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:41.638
You agreed to be a part of this
and it doesn't even mean anything to you?

01:03:44.164 --> 01:03:45.861
It's even more disgusting.

01:03:50.846 --> 01:03:55.063
Tristan called it a reckoning.

01:03:55.162 --> 01:03:56.617
A reckoning?

01:03:57.786 --> 01:03:59.481
For what? You're a kid!

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:01.137
I'm eighteen.

01:04:03.014 --> 01:04:04.826
You're pathetic, is what you are.

01:04:08.491 --> 01:04:10.043
What did you know about me?

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.261
Before all this?

01:04:14.577 --> 01:04:15.741
Nothing.

01:04:16.788 --> 01:04:18.538
You are incredibly forgettable.

01:04:19.991 --> 01:04:21.437
Come on.

01:04:22.655 --> 01:04:23.529
Come on!

01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:25.752
God, what are you fishing for, Kip?

01:04:25.815 --> 01:04:27.001
Sixth grade.

01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:31.420
Chloe Paul and AJ Turner

01:04:31.963 --> 01:04:36.658
sneak up and pulled my pants down
in front of assembly.

01:04:37.947 --> 01:04:39.216
But they also got my underwear.

01:04:39.316 --> 01:04:41.351
- That's what this is about?
- Don't.

01:04:41.442 --> 01:04:44.916
Oh, sorry. Have I belittled your motivation
for cold blooded murder?

01:04:45.016 --> 01:04:46.870
You just want me to say
what you already know.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.547
Kip, I personally hope you rot in here.

01:04:54.304 --> 01:04:56.147
But a cop will probably find you.

01:04:57.886 --> 01:04:59.112
Eventually.

01:05:00.136 --> 01:05:02.378
Everyone laughed at me, naked!

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:05.932
And it started years of people
giggling near me.

01:05:06.262 --> 01:05:07.380
Behind me.

01:05:08.342 --> 01:05:10.264
So many veil jokes.

01:05:10.545 --> 01:05:12.388
Even from teachers.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:15.362
About my coming up short on homework.

01:05:20.104 --> 01:05:21.385
Do you ever think

01:05:22.229 --> 01:05:24.674
that the people you heard giggling

01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:27.166
were happy?

01:05:29.573 --> 01:05:35.131
And maybe teachers with no idea
which words were triggering you

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:37.501
just didn't wanna see you flunk?

01:05:39.753 --> 01:05:40.956
Not only...

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:46.443
does this punishment not fit any crime,

01:05:50.042 --> 01:05:51.519
but Kip,

01:05:53.315 --> 01:05:55.878
most of these people
are completely innocent.

01:06:00.362 --> 01:06:02.620
This girl, Amy Kim,

01:06:07.718 --> 01:06:10.578
died in my arms
on the bathroom floor today.

01:06:13.868 --> 01:06:17.580
And all I know about her
is that she liked horses.

01:06:23.975 --> 01:06:27.199
On these little ribbons for jumping them.

01:06:41.262 --> 01:06:43.887
How did she deserve to go like that?

01:07:00.044 --> 01:07:01.363
I'm a numbers guy.

01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:03.622
Sure. I would like to...

01:07:03.818 --> 01:07:06.266
look at my name on the scoreboard
just like anyone.

01:07:06.601 --> 01:07:09.624
But never ever let it be said

01:07:10.257 --> 01:07:12.523
that playing video games
leads to real life violence.

01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:14.006
It doesn't.

01:07:14.382 --> 01:07:15.999
Sudoku though... I mean...

01:07:17.007 --> 01:07:19.111
Come on, that is scary shit.

01:07:19.421 --> 01:07:21.741
<i>Anyway, when you plan
your very own mass shooting</i>

01:07:22.286 --> 01:07:25.598
<i>don't just go for the ** one of these
like they all do.</i>

01:07:26.022 --> 01:07:28.046
<i>They don't have a set number
in mind, they just...</i>

01:07:28.084 --> 01:07:29.444
- <i>They wanna be bigger...</i>
- Todd.

01:07:29.469 --> 01:07:31.260
<i>and they wanna be better,
so they just go in...</i>

01:07:31.337 --> 01:07:32.783
Lauren, Lauren Cope.

01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:34.991
I used to cut your
wife's hair before.

01:07:35.002 --> 01:07:36.683
Oh yeah, yeah, right.

01:07:37.182 --> 01:07:38.080
Thanks.

01:07:38.361 --> 01:07:40.617
I don't even know what the hell
are we looking at in here.

01:07:40.717 --> 01:07:43.644
It's a live stream from inside the school.
It's happening right now.

01:07:44.517 --> 01:07:47.008
<i>I mean how can you hit a target
if you are not aiming?</i>

01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:50.071
<i>Me, I've got a number.
The number that I specially like.</i>

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.149
<i>And I figure out how to get it.</i>

01:08:17.604 --> 01:08:19.073
- Please Zoe.
- No.

01:08:19.198 --> 01:08:21.652
No. I'm sorry.
I'm not one of them.

01:08:21.676 --> 01:08:22.754
Okay?

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:23.894
Okay.

01:08:23.919 --> 01:08:25.723
You guys, you need to get out of here
right now.

01:08:25.747 --> 01:08:28.536
We're trying to.
Claire says they are in the cafeteria.

01:08:29.053 --> 01:08:30.685
<i>Chaz Harting getting...</i>

01:08:32.216 --> 01:08:33.178
Okay. Good.

01:08:33.216 --> 01:08:34.678
Good. Come on.

01:08:35.904 --> 01:08:37.974
<i>...indecisive, helpless...</i>

01:08:39.975 --> 01:08:41.380
Hello.

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:43.560
Holy shit! Girl.

01:08:44.295 --> 01:08:45.997
Yeah, yeah. I'll find him.

01:08:46.443 --> 01:08:48.020
Give me one second.

01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:50.731
Sheriff. Sheriff. Hey.

01:08:50.831 --> 01:08:53.087
Do you remember that friend that
I was telling you about.

01:08:53.187 --> 01:08:54.781
The one that saved all of our asses?

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.358
She's calling from inside.

01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:58.139
Toss it. Let's go.

01:08:59.264 --> 01:09:00.279
Hello.

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:01.553
Hello to you too.

01:09:01.965 --> 01:09:03.323
Look, Sheriff.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:05.917
An entire class
will come out right now.

01:09:06.332 --> 01:09:08.752
But the shooters are watching
our every move on the news.

01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:10.814
Okay. Hang in there.
Let me see what I can do.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.660
Okay.

01:09:12.863 --> 01:09:15.425
As students inside are preparing
for their greatest test yet

01:09:15.721 --> 01:09:17.894
one more failure
could cost them their lives.

01:09:17.919 --> 01:09:19.942
Hey, don't put the school
in the shot for a few minutes.

01:09:19.966 --> 01:09:22.011
- We have every right to do...
- No. I know you do,

01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:24.622
but that nutcase is
watching your broadcast.

01:09:24.653 --> 01:09:27.575
All right? So I know I can't make you
so I am asking.

01:09:27.698 --> 01:09:29.390
Talk to the parents,
interview the kids,

01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:31.968
anything but keep
the school out of the shot, okay?

01:09:32.026 --> 01:09:33.179
I'm happy to not show the school.

01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:34.546
Well, good! I appreciate that.

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:36.219
If you give me something
better to point our camera at.

01:09:36.243 --> 01:09:37.423
We got it.

01:09:39.953 --> 01:09:42.868
How about a shot of me
personally calling that asshole?

01:09:42.893 --> 01:09:44.298
Great. On speakerphone.

01:09:49.212 --> 01:09:50.526
Fast! Fast!

01:09:57.096 --> 01:09:59.451
I will take a large wine pizza.

01:09:59.578 --> 01:10:00.765
Easy on the cheese please

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.957
as I am dairy sensitive.

01:10:03.969 --> 01:10:06.705
Is that what this is all about, Tristan,
a lunch order?

01:10:06.747 --> 01:10:08.230
What I'm saying, Sheriff is that

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.964
there is nothing
you can do for me

01:10:11.334 --> 01:10:13.597
except watch me beat the game.

01:10:14.236 --> 01:10:16.814
The game is easy to win
if you are the only one playing.

01:10:18.158 --> 01:10:19.767
Nothing about this

01:10:20.064 --> 01:10:21.557
was easy.

01:10:22.188 --> 01:10:23.892
All clear! All clear!

01:10:24.297 --> 01:10:27.500
Okay, police is just around these corners,
go as fast as you can. Go!

01:10:27.525 --> 01:10:29.461
- Nice!
- You're coming. Aren't you?

01:10:29.486 --> 01:10:32.561
No. Everyone's still in lock down.
I'm gonna try to warn as many as I can, OK?

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:33.861
Not alone, you are not.

01:10:33.892 --> 01:10:35.593
- Mrs Crawford.
- Go everyone. Run!

01:10:35.802 --> 01:10:37.433
So you get to see where they are.

01:10:37.599 --> 01:10:38.740
Come on. Go.

01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:40.601
You are obviously very smart.

01:10:41.165 --> 01:10:42.407
Come on.

01:10:43.486 --> 01:10:45.868
And I don't need some local lard ass cop
to tell me that.

01:10:46.232 --> 01:10:48.576
Fair enough,
I could stand to lose a few

01:10:48.601 --> 01:10:51.759
Come on man, you are gonna work
that angle to sensible negotiator

01:10:51.784 --> 01:10:54.988
who shares a bit of his own life?
I don't care how close you are to...

01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:56.723
retirement or about your...

01:10:57.043 --> 01:11:00.660
beloved wife, who you lost,
and now you understand anger too.

01:11:01.114 --> 01:11:02.567
My wife is just fine.

01:11:04.046 --> 01:11:06.312
I'm afraid I can't say the same
about your mother.

01:11:08.537 --> 01:11:10.037
You paid her a visit, didn't you?

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:13.288
Well,

01:11:13.526 --> 01:11:15.917
I hope she's still watching.
I think if she watches

01:11:15.942 --> 01:11:17.823
all the way through,
she will finally be proud.

01:11:17.862 --> 01:11:19.878
Barbara, it's Jane Crawford.

01:11:19.903 --> 01:11:20.925
Jane.

01:11:21.057 --> 01:11:22.542
Jane, we're in here.

01:11:24.128 --> 01:11:28.830
Oh, God! The rooms aren't safe. We have
to get everyone out. Come on. Let's go.

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:30.307
Hurry!

01:11:31.089 --> 01:11:31.940
This way.

01:11:32.182 --> 01:11:33.940
You see, Sheriff,

01:11:34.573 --> 01:11:36.503
I'm an agent of change.

01:11:36.776 --> 01:11:38.643
Midwife of the truth.

01:11:38.831 --> 01:11:40.682
I am an embodiment.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:42.440
That sounds exhausting.

01:11:43.175 --> 01:11:45.448
Yeah, it's because it hurts
your tiny brain.

01:11:45.972 --> 01:11:49.628
Then why don't you explain it to me
is that you are a small child?

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:52.448
In a way that I have to explain
everything to everyone?

01:11:53.081 --> 01:11:54.198
Yes.

01:11:54.566 --> 01:11:56.151
You really put me on the spot sheriff.

01:11:57.722 --> 01:11:59.073
But I'll give it a try.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.429
I could have the people
in this room

01:12:02.462 --> 01:12:05.591
do the most vile things to each other
in order to stay alive.

01:12:07.165 --> 01:12:08.351
And they would.

01:12:08.814 --> 01:12:09.720
Right?

01:12:13.432 --> 01:12:14.955
That doesn't interest me.

01:12:17.159 --> 01:12:19.307
See, humanity is a joke,

01:12:19.407 --> 01:12:21.489
and you my friend
are the punch line.

01:12:21.589 --> 01:12:23.831
You are the sheep, and I am the Shephard.

01:12:23.931 --> 01:12:26.130
And I am going to lead you all
to the fucking cliff

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:29.228
because you've been begging for it.

01:12:29.533 --> 01:12:31.822
Tristan, nobody in that room
asked for this.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:35.103
Oh, come on! That is fucking bullshit.

01:12:35.853 --> 01:12:37.728
Okay? Everybody watching

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.657
is culpable, you all post,
and you tweet and you share.

01:12:41.682 --> 01:12:44.427
Everybody jumps for the chance
to be both judge and jury.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:49.073
But in that system, Sheriff,
you've have created a job opening.

01:12:50.674 --> 01:12:52.252
An executioner.

01:12:54.573 --> 01:12:56.495
You created me.

01:13:00.197 --> 01:13:01.385
So...

01:13:01.854 --> 01:13:05.119
Do you feel that you have made your point?
Is that what you wanted?

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.995
Yeah, sure, yeah. Great job, Sheriff.

01:13:10.724 --> 01:13:11.861
You've worked it all out.

01:13:11.961 --> 01:13:13.173
If there is no hard feelings

01:13:13.273 --> 01:13:15.507
I'd love to invite you up
to my new cabin in Broken Bow.

01:13:15.607 --> 01:13:18.829
We can pack up with some cold ones,
shoot the shit.

01:13:18.893 --> 01:13:20.453
Play some pool.

01:13:20.682 --> 01:13:23.158
I guess, all I needed today
was to talk to some old fuck.

01:13:23.213 --> 01:13:24.753
Go figure, right?

01:13:24.932 --> 01:13:26.017
Tristan,

01:13:26.142 --> 01:13:27.846
I am asking you

01:13:28.314 --> 01:13:30.807
Please! Let those kids go.

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:37.030
How can we get everyone out
of that room safely including yourself?

01:13:37.273 --> 01:13:38.695
- It's not looking good.
- Hey!

01:13:44.465 --> 01:13:46.879
Someone is letting the things out.

01:13:48.903 --> 01:13:50.723
I see what you did there, sheriff.

01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:53.473
My turn.

01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:59.028
- Right this way.
- Mom.

01:13:59.341 --> 01:14:00.864
Connor.

01:14:03.544 --> 01:14:04.942
Thank God.

01:14:08.012 --> 01:14:10.059
Hey. Did you see Zoe Hull in there?

01:14:10.084 --> 01:14:12.130
Yeah, she got dirty blond hair,
she's tall, skinny--

01:14:12.155 --> 01:14:13.959
I know. She saved us.

01:14:14.515 --> 01:14:17.222
She was even outside at one point
but she went back inside to help.

01:14:17.322 --> 01:14:20.352
Ma'am, just a few more questions
for your son, if you wouldn't mind.

01:14:20.845 --> 01:14:22.134
Right this way.

01:14:22.728 --> 01:14:24.087
Anyway, I've got a number....

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.649
It's not fast, and it's not furious,
none of that shit.

01:14:27.279 --> 01:14:29.294
Little closer to "Tortoise & The Hare".

01:14:29.646 --> 01:14:32.381
That's the reason I want
the OG twist ending so...

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:34.474
please, watch and see.

01:14:34.724 --> 01:14:37.298
It's like, it's not safe
to shelter in place

01:14:37.322 --> 01:14:39.896
that shooters are going around
to the different rooms.

01:14:40.271 --> 01:14:42.537
Rounding up the kids
and bringing them

01:14:42.617 --> 01:14:45.193
to the cafeteria, and that's dangerous.
But we gonna have to go.

01:14:45.292 --> 01:14:48.041
Everyone, we have to get up,
and we've to get out of here.

01:14:51.358 --> 01:14:52.795
Anna.

01:14:56.866 --> 01:14:58.170
Kip?

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:03.214
Okay, look, if nobody
from my team is responding,

01:15:03.314 --> 01:15:05.831
is it safe to say
that this might be our guardian angel?

01:15:08.665 --> 01:15:09.978
Will you please talk to me?

01:15:11.809 --> 01:15:12.408
No?

01:15:13.764 --> 01:15:17.225
Maybe like the rest of the world
you're watching our show?

01:15:22.392 --> 01:15:25.056
I already asked nicely once.

01:15:27.582 --> 01:15:28.676
I'm here.

01:15:29.533 --> 01:15:30.892
Well, hello!

01:15:32.501 --> 01:15:34.150
You're a chick.

01:15:35.494 --> 01:15:36.892
What's your name, sweetheart?

01:15:38.087 --> 01:15:39.634
It's Zoe Hull.

01:15:41.619 --> 01:15:43.001
It's vaguely familiar.

01:15:44.025 --> 01:15:46.525
So, if you are talking to me
from Anna's phone...

01:15:47.814 --> 01:15:49.330
She's dead.

01:15:50.931 --> 01:15:51.813
Huh?

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.456
And Kip?

01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.551
Alive.

01:16:00.428 --> 01:16:01.959
Wishing he was dead.

01:16:02.294 --> 01:16:05.857
You've really made a mess of things, Zoe,
you've really pissed in my corn flakes.

01:16:06.326 --> 01:16:09.014
Do you want more people to die?
Is that why you did this?

01:16:09.123 --> 01:16:10.647
No. That's the last thing I want.

01:16:10.897 --> 01:16:12.475
All right, well.

01:16:13.037 --> 01:16:14.254
Here is what happens now.

01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:17.190
You're gonna drop whatever
you're doing and you're gonna come to me.

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:18.964
You're gonna beg for my forgiveness

01:16:19.102 --> 01:16:22.860
and that of my friend Chris, cause that
was his little sister you just cut down.

01:16:24.007 --> 01:16:28.267
And to help motivate you, I'm gonna kill
one person in this room every five minutes

01:16:28.391 --> 01:16:29.519
you don't show your face.

01:16:29.619 --> 01:16:30.711
Zoe, he'll kill you.

01:16:30.736 --> 01:16:33.063
And the timer starts now.

01:16:34.336 --> 01:16:36.383
Stop! Stop! I'm on my way. Okay?

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:37.386
You can't just--

01:16:37.486 --> 01:16:39.878
Get them out of here,
and yourself too. Go!

01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:48.248
See, I don't make threats.

01:16:49.365 --> 01:16:51.599
Okay? I provide
opportunities for growth.

01:16:54.053 --> 01:16:56.483
Move. Out of the way,
out of the way, get back.

01:16:56.514 --> 01:17:00.310
Move. Move, out of the way,
come on, let's go, let's go.

01:17:00.335 --> 01:17:03.147
Move it, move it,
out of the way. Out of the way.

01:17:03.172 --> 01:17:04.788
Move. Come on. Let's go.

01:17:04.813 --> 01:17:07.498
Move it, move it. Let's go.

01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:09.272
Move. Move. Come on.

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:11.468
Let's go. Move it.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.179
Move.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:22.031
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Move. Move.

01:17:46.974 --> 01:17:48.825
Please. Kill me.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.354
I shot Vicky Wolves
when she was running away.

01:17:55.264 --> 01:17:57.772
She always used to smile at me.

01:18:01.172 --> 01:18:02.993
You have to pay for her murder.

01:18:03.508 --> 01:18:05.376
And all the others, believe it.

01:18:05.938 --> 01:18:07.062
What are you doing?

01:18:07.113 --> 01:18:09.349
Tik Tock, Zoe.

01:18:11.415 --> 01:18:13.080
I'm bad with numbers.

01:18:14.703 --> 01:18:16.461
But, has it been...

01:18:17.406 --> 01:18:18.703
two minutes or...

01:18:19.117 --> 01:18:20.641
four and a half?

01:18:20.666 --> 01:18:22.446
Okay. Right now.

01:18:22.594 --> 01:18:25.453
Right now, you are just a sad fat kid

01:18:25.478 --> 01:18:27.440
everyone in the world
will hate,

01:18:27.465 --> 01:18:30.805
and when they look for a motive,
they'll find out you were bullied.

01:18:30.926 --> 01:18:34.614
Someone will remember that day
in the assembly

01:18:34.762 --> 01:18:38.270
and strangers will laugh at you
all over again.

01:18:39.231 --> 01:18:41.325
Do you want that to be your legacy?

01:18:47.786 --> 01:18:49.857
Very good. Come on.

01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:54.524
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

01:18:56.718 --> 01:18:59.824
- Where do you want us to stage?
- Copy. They just landed.

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.362
Right up here.

01:19:16.053 --> 01:19:17.701
I'll kill another I guess.

01:19:17.756 --> 01:19:18.873
Wait!

01:19:19.248 --> 01:19:20.358
Wait!

01:19:24.756 --> 01:19:25.905
Fuck.

01:19:25.974 --> 01:19:27.209
You?

01:19:28.482 --> 01:19:30.349
Green Jacket girl?

01:19:32.146 --> 01:19:34.333
When is the last time you
took that damn thing off?

01:19:40.185 --> 01:19:42.490
Don't be shy, come in. Join us.

01:19:43.474 --> 01:19:45.646
You can kill me,
just as easily, right here.

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:50.584
I know. But, that would be terrible
for rating. So, come in.

01:19:53.795 --> 01:19:56.147
I literally insist.

01:20:01.398 --> 01:20:02.781
Zoe, America.

01:20:02.944 --> 01:20:06.141
America, this is Zoe. Our guardian angel.

01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:10.394
Zoe.

01:20:10.642 --> 01:20:13.351
While you've been prancing around
doing God knows what

01:20:13.376 --> 01:20:15.525
we've managed to make
national television.

01:20:16.976 --> 01:20:18.741
Fuck, I mean I figure
at the rate we are going

01:20:18.765 --> 01:20:20.480
we'll probably make international too.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.261
And for those playing the home game

01:20:24.254 --> 01:20:28.230
we've just unlocked the bonus round
for 'Anything can happen.'

01:20:39.449 --> 01:20:41.512
What? Fame doesn't do it for you, Zoe?

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:43.558
No.

01:20:46.082 --> 01:20:47.277
What does?

01:20:48.207 --> 01:20:49.543
People.

01:20:50.949 --> 01:20:53.199
Myself included, not dying.

01:20:56.142 --> 01:20:58.126
And what does it for you?

01:21:03.009 --> 01:21:04.494
Being definitive.

01:21:06.369 --> 01:21:09.275
And creating the ultimate version
of something.

01:21:10.064 --> 01:21:12.627
I don't even have to be the first,
I just have to be

01:21:13.150 --> 01:21:14.509
the best.

01:21:16.408 --> 01:21:17.963
You killed my sister?

01:21:20.025 --> 01:21:21.674
She was trying to kill me.

01:21:22.773 --> 01:21:24.681
I mean none of this
ever had to happen--

01:21:25.224 --> 01:21:27.270
None of this ever had to happen.

01:21:30.712 --> 01:21:33.202
God damn! Stand still, you bastards.

01:21:33.471 --> 01:21:36.275
Zoe, did somebody tip you off
as to what we had planned?

01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:38.721
- No.
- So, it was just a...

01:21:39.275 --> 01:21:41.384
right time, right place kind of situation?

01:21:41.718 --> 01:21:43.156
Something like that.

01:21:44.361 --> 01:21:46.314
She has to die, not just in...

01:21:46.322 --> 01:21:48.978
I will tell you
when it's the right time, Chris.

01:21:49.152 --> 01:21:50.463
Chris, I will tell you

01:21:50.563 --> 01:21:52.404
- when it is the right time.
- For Anna!

01:21:52.818 --> 01:21:53.935
Okay?

01:21:57.706 --> 01:22:01.073
He's obviously
and understandably upset about his...

01:22:06.726 --> 01:22:07.648
sister.

01:22:10.789 --> 01:22:12.763
I don't know
who the hell are you.

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:15.882
It's over.

01:22:18.257 --> 01:22:19.319
Kiper.

01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:23.436
You didn't have the stomach
for it after all.

01:22:25.913 --> 01:22:27.686
Drop the guns.

01:22:27.952 --> 01:22:29.669
- I'm not kidding.
- If we don't, Kip,

01:22:29.769 --> 01:22:31.474
you are gonna have to do
a lot more killing.

01:22:31.574 --> 01:22:34.456
Do you wanna do more killing, Kip?
Are you prepared to do that?

01:22:37.465 --> 01:22:39.512
Put it down.

01:22:39.537 --> 01:22:41.543
You put it down, asshole!

01:22:41.568 --> 01:22:42.863
Fuck you!

01:22:51.756 --> 01:22:52.905
Hey!

01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:00.491
Come on! Come on, Lewis!

01:23:01.266 --> 01:23:02.977
Keep going, keep going.

01:23:03.393 --> 01:23:04.199
I'll bring 'em back.

01:23:04.227 --> 01:23:07.483
No. Go kill them and bring back
the fucking phone.

01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:12.732
Come on.

01:23:12.779 --> 01:23:15.216
Lewis, Come on.
Keep going. Keep going.

01:23:17.248 --> 01:23:20.513
Everybody stay the fuck down!
This is not over.

01:23:23.701 --> 01:23:24.560
Run.

01:23:24.623 --> 01:23:25.857
Lewis, run.

01:23:26.764 --> 01:23:28.978
Shit, shit. Come on.

01:23:29.041 --> 01:23:29.752
Leave me.

01:23:29.803 --> 01:23:32.339
Leave you? What kind of this is that?
Come on!

01:23:34.846 --> 01:23:36.340
You're okay? You were hit?

01:23:36.584 --> 01:23:38.509
Hence the "leave me" idea. Yeah.

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:40.077
How bad is it?

01:23:40.262 --> 01:23:43.618
Well, according to you nothing matters
if it happens at high school.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:45.741
Okay, okay.

01:23:47.037 --> 01:23:48.405
Okay. Come on.

01:23:48.436 --> 01:23:49.655
Come on.

01:23:50.014 --> 01:23:51.694
Come on. You got this.

01:23:56.241 --> 01:23:57.991
You're okay. You're okay.

01:23:58.428 --> 01:24:00.029
No, no, no! No, no, no!

01:24:00.108 --> 01:24:01.522
I don't want them to see us. Okay?

01:24:01.723 --> 01:24:03.223
I don't want them to see us.

01:24:06.997 --> 01:24:08.653
- It's cold in here.
- No!

01:24:09.091 --> 01:24:11.091
No. You're not allowed to do that. Okay?

01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:15.755
Right here.

01:24:16.835 --> 01:24:18.304
Shit. Shit!

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.743
Okay. Let me see.

01:24:21.751 --> 01:24:22.798
I need to tell you something.

01:24:22.817 --> 01:24:24.184
No, not now.

01:24:24.603 --> 01:24:25.900
Okay? Just...

01:24:26.384 --> 01:24:28.439
- tell me at prom.
- Yeah.

01:24:34.446 --> 01:24:37.298
You are not
the only good thing in my life.

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:40.009
Oh, you are the best thing.

01:24:40.861 --> 01:24:43.195
Yeah, that's... so great.

01:24:45.972 --> 01:24:47.263
And I feel the same way.

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:50.128
But I really do need
to tell you something.

01:24:50.152 --> 01:24:52.270
I think the vans
are rigged to explode.

01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:55.747
- They are in the cafeteria?
- Yeah.

01:24:57.979 --> 01:24:58.525
Shit!

01:24:58.756 --> 01:25:00.269
- No, you stay.
- I can't.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.960
This part I remember perfectly.

01:25:56.696 --> 01:25:58.024
You and me.

01:26:00.258 --> 01:26:01.625
We're stuck in a loop.

01:26:09.463 --> 01:26:11.088
You know, it's not always you.

01:26:13.193 --> 01:26:14.271
But every time

01:26:14.451 --> 01:26:15.654
I'm in this room

01:26:15.810 --> 01:26:17.435
I kill something.

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:20.686
Shit.

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.615
Killing my sister was new.

01:26:28.818 --> 01:26:30.732
How'd you break that pattern, huh?

01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:35.894
It was the symbols, wasn't it?

01:26:36.552 --> 01:26:37.240
Yeah.

01:26:38.465 --> 01:26:40.527
Almost got them in the right order.

01:26:42.051 --> 01:26:43.785
Been collecting 'em longer than you.

01:26:43.925 --> 01:26:45.004
So...

01:26:45.465 --> 01:26:48.379
fuck you, if you think
you're gonna get out before me!

01:26:56.243 --> 01:26:57.407
No.

01:27:21.787 --> 01:27:23.951
Wait, wait!

01:27:24.045 --> 01:27:25.927
It was the symbols.

01:27:25.952 --> 01:27:28.748
That, it's hard to change the pattern.

01:27:28.773 --> 01:27:29.663
Oh yeah?

01:27:31.235 --> 01:27:33.789
I can show you the way out.

01:27:35.102 --> 01:27:38.735
That's exactly what they told me
you'd say.

01:28:03.067 --> 01:28:04.825
There. Tree line.

01:28:05.358 --> 01:28:07.303
Hands up. Hands up.

01:28:08.014 --> 01:28:09.881
Show us your hands.

01:28:11.256 --> 01:28:13.170
On the ground! On the ground!

01:28:13.303 --> 01:28:14.858
On the ground.

01:28:15.897 --> 01:28:17.256
On the ground.

01:28:22.248 --> 01:28:23.272
Chris.

01:28:26.055 --> 01:28:27.250
Report back, man.

01:28:47.974 --> 01:28:49.130
Chris.

01:28:49.904 --> 01:28:51.888
Come on, man. Answer me.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.708
Fight!

01:29:08.154 --> 01:29:09.966
Chris, man, answer me.

01:29:16.575 --> 01:29:17.857
What do you think?

01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:19.927
Worth a thousand words?

01:29:33.497 --> 01:29:34.552
Fuck.

01:29:44.122 --> 01:29:46.247
Now, you're the one not talking?

01:29:51.779 --> 01:29:53.685
What's wrong, Tristan?

01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:57.130
I thought we've built up
a nice support.

01:30:00.107 --> 01:30:01.935
Am I not being polite enough?

01:30:07.472 --> 01:30:11.432
With no response, can I assume
you are watching my stream?

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.895
You have no fucking idea
who you're dealing with.

01:30:28.403 --> 01:30:29.638
You know, you're right.

01:30:30.047 --> 01:30:33.125
You actually
are starting to slip my mind.

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.815
I mean... isn't it ironic?

01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:41.290
That after all your goddamn hard work

01:30:42.288 --> 01:30:44.905
people aren't gonna remember you?

01:30:46.086 --> 01:30:47.078
No?

01:30:47.695 --> 01:30:48.718
No.

01:30:51.086 --> 01:30:52.851
They are gonna remember me.

01:31:14.453 --> 01:31:15.937
- Get up. On your feet.
- Please.

01:31:15.962 --> 01:31:16.546
Please.

01:31:16.593 --> 01:31:18.414
Move! Get up on your feet!

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:20.108
Everybody else stay the fuck down.

01:31:20.171 --> 01:31:22.827
Noses to the ground.
If you look at me I will fucking kill you.

01:31:22.852 --> 01:31:24.882
Take this and move. Go. Go!

01:31:25.421 --> 01:31:26.812
Go!

01:31:33.343 --> 01:31:34.625
I was praying that it was you.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:36.132
I thought I told you to get outside.

01:31:36.171 --> 01:31:38.460
I will now. This is the last group
from the roofs.

01:31:39.492 --> 01:31:41.819
- Are you coming with us this time?
- I'll be right there.

01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:43.515
I'll be right there.

01:31:44.671 --> 01:31:46.718
All right. Come on. Let's go.

01:31:51.429 --> 01:31:53.601
All right. Just like your mama taught you.

01:31:53.951 --> 01:31:56.309
It really does not have to be difficult.

01:32:10.438 --> 01:32:11.648
Keep moving.

01:32:11.673 --> 01:32:12.900
Keep walking.

01:32:13.555 --> 01:32:16.038
All right? Do not turn around.

01:32:16.127 --> 01:32:17.174
Fuck.

01:32:20.396 --> 01:32:21.978
Okay.

01:32:24.781 --> 01:32:27.648
Get out! Now! Okay?
He's gone. Go!

01:32:35.073 --> 01:32:37.098
Jesus Christ! Jesus.

01:32:37.608 --> 01:32:39.006
There is a bomb in there!

01:32:39.150 --> 01:32:41.064
Go! Go! Please! Come on!

01:32:41.674 --> 01:32:43.939
Good! Good! Keep going!

01:32:44.438 --> 01:32:46.023
Over here. Help me!

01:32:46.062 --> 01:32:48.110
Good. Faster! Move, move.

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:50.574
Good, good. Keep going. Keep going.

01:32:51.059 --> 01:32:52.432
Go. Go.

01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:57.640
Shit.

01:33:27.793 --> 01:33:29.219
All right. Let's go. Let's go!

01:33:29.287 --> 01:33:30.697
Move. Go. Go.

01:33:34.996 --> 01:33:36.711
All right. Let's go! Let's move it!

01:33:47.449 --> 01:33:48.638
Oh my God.

01:34:07.192 --> 01:34:08.278
Stop!

01:34:08.553 --> 01:34:10.428
Stop! On your knees.

01:34:11.131 --> 01:34:12.365
Put your hands high.

01:34:12.545 --> 01:34:14.357
Get 'em up. Above your head.

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:28.598
Bravo team. We're on the first floor.

01:34:29.144 --> 01:34:30.871
Suspect is neutralized.

01:34:32.863 --> 01:34:35.441
Hey, fall through, fall through.
Let me know when you got a clear.

01:34:35.466 --> 01:34:38.215
Hey, I said on the fucking ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

01:34:41.365 --> 01:34:42.498
Come on.

01:34:55.787 --> 01:34:57.881
Oh, that's gratitude for you?

01:35:06.787 --> 01:35:09.045
Don't they know who you are?

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:13.717
You look beautiful.

01:35:15.264 --> 01:35:16.443
I know.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.859
It feels good.

01:35:21.617 --> 01:35:22.679
Thank you.

01:35:29.373 --> 01:35:30.725
I have to go now.

01:35:32.548 --> 01:35:33.650
I love you.

01:35:37.302 --> 01:35:38.474
Goodbye.

01:36:32.856 --> 01:36:35.561
You freed up in your hands
so I could shake one.

01:36:40.328 --> 01:36:42.914
SWAT guys had no idea
who you were so...

01:36:43.696 --> 01:36:45.305
I'm sorry about that.

01:36:48.328 --> 01:36:50.766
You know, lot of folks
have a lot of questions for you.

01:36:52.719 --> 01:36:54.797
But we can talk about that later.

01:36:57.821 --> 01:37:00.094
That was a hell of a thing
you did in there.

01:37:00.274 --> 01:37:01.399
Really.

01:37:01.424 --> 01:37:04.071
- All we are very proud of you, Zoe.
- And Tristan?

01:37:04.787 --> 01:37:05.857
Dead.

01:37:05.995 --> 01:37:07.252
Burned to a crisp.

01:37:08.354 --> 01:37:10.549
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

01:37:11.502 --> 01:37:12.642
Well...

01:37:13.244 --> 01:37:14.517
almost anyone.

01:37:21.807 --> 01:37:23.197
Standby one.

01:37:24.315 --> 01:37:26.494
Can I ask you to do something for me?

01:37:27.463 --> 01:37:28.330
Name it.

01:37:38.468 --> 01:37:39.616
You were right.

01:37:45.156 --> 01:37:46.601
I was at war.

01:37:48.289 --> 01:37:50.195
Thank Christ for that.

01:37:56.337 --> 01:37:58.064
Mom would know

01:37:58.587 --> 01:38:00.517
just what to say right now, wouldn't she?

01:38:00.931 --> 01:38:02.447
Yes, she would.

01:38:04.150 --> 01:38:06.595
I guess that's why
I still talk to her sometimes.

01:38:07.336 --> 01:38:08.390
Really?

01:38:09.234 --> 01:38:10.507
Yeah.

01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:13.183
It's creepy.

01:38:16.487 --> 01:38:17.412
Yeah.

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.541
Thanks for saving my life.

01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:25.898
Honey...

01:38:26.255 --> 01:38:27.747
we are even.

01:38:29.544 --> 01:38:31.793
You gave mine a purpose

01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:35.620
eighteen years ago.

01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:44.110
Hey!

01:38:44.116 --> 01:38:45.412
Is he gonna be okay?

01:38:45.437 --> 01:38:46.670
Yeah, should be.

01:38:46.708 --> 01:38:48.412
We need to take a look
at that leg.

01:38:48.623 --> 01:38:51.060
Oh, I'll be right over.

01:38:54.524 --> 01:38:56.227
Hey man, in a moment.

01:39:02.505 --> 01:39:04.107
What did they do with your rifle?

01:39:04.146 --> 01:39:05.473
Nothing yet.

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:08.271
Last I saw it
there was some little yellow

01:39:08.296 --> 01:39:10.145
evidence markers around it.

01:39:15.473 --> 01:39:16.988
It should be right where I left it.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.745
Oh.

01:40:43.355 --> 01:40:47.330
I didn't expect
to deal with this scenario.

01:40:50.784 --> 01:40:54.461
But there is unfinished business
to tend to.

01:40:56.378 --> 01:40:58.034
You see, it's tempting

01:40:58.222 --> 01:41:00.386
to let nature run its course.

01:41:01.892 --> 01:41:04.455
The lungs will fill with blood.

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:08.141
And the animal will die naturally.

01:41:11.703 --> 01:41:13.695
But with that process

01:41:14.150 --> 01:41:16.085
comes extreme pain.

01:41:28.359 --> 01:41:31.078
And it just isn't right to let it suffer.

01:41:41.773 --> 01:41:43.273
