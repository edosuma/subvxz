WEBVTT

00:35.166 --> 00:37.833
Helsinki, get out of there.
Take shelter in the museum.

00:37.916 --> 00:39.166
I'm making a trench!

01:13.541 --> 01:14.875
Helsinki, do you copy?

01:16.625 --> 01:17.833
Helsinki, are you there?

01:20.458 --> 01:21.791
Fatty!

01:29.166 --> 01:31.125
I'm alive.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.166
Get out of there now!

01:40.416 --> 01:41.625
Leg trapped.

01:43.125 --> 01:44.375
Open wound.

01:45.833 --> 01:46.750
Blood.

01:47.666 --> 01:48.666
Lots of blood.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.791
Don't fall asleep. We're almost there.

01:50.875 --> 01:53.250
I promise you, once we get out of here,

01:54.125 --> 01:56.541
I'm going to show you,
three nights in a row,

01:56.625 --> 01:58.958
why Argentinian meat
is the best in the world.

01:59.458 --> 02:00.583
And then what?

02:01.458 --> 02:03.208
You'll take me to the movies?

02:04.083 --> 02:07.791
Yes, but only if you don't fall asleep.
Promise me you'll stay awake.

02:07.875 --> 02:09.166
I'm awake.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.500
Squadrons three and nine, now!

02:12.583 --> 02:13.833
Move! Come on!

02:17.250 --> 02:18.125
They're here.

02:22.750 --> 02:26.583
We don't know what just happened.
It looks like a terrible explosion.

02:26.666 --> 02:29.541
There are hundreds of people
here at the Bank of Spain…

02:29.625 --> 02:32.291
LIVE
HEIST AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

02:36.625 --> 02:39.083
This is the Professor.
The stormwater tank is safe.

02:39.625 --> 02:41.875
I request an assessment
of the situation. Palermo!

02:41.958 --> 02:45.291
They blew up the roof! Bogotá,
Rio and I are going to the top floor.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.416
Helsinki's trapped.

02:47.916 --> 02:49.041
Lisbon, location.

02:49.958 --> 02:51.666
Second floor, with Stockholm.

02:51.750 --> 02:52.833
Tokyo, location.

02:53.625 --> 02:57.000
About to go out onto the roof.
We'll attack them from behind.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.000
-No, don't open that door!
-What?

02:59.083 --> 03:01.125
-And Helsinki?
-They'll kill you.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.416
They're coming down!

03:05.250 --> 03:08.250
Cover the flanks and stay together.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.375
If you don't go, they'll kill Helsinki.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.291
Go!

03:13.875 --> 03:15.458
Should we go out or not?

03:15.541 --> 03:19.000
There are 100 snipers aiming
at the roof, and they're soldiers.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.666
They won't let you attack
from behind. They'll blow your heads off.

03:22.791 --> 03:25.041
Professor, you're sacrificing a man!

03:25.125 --> 03:28.041
The only way to save him
is to attack on two flanks.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.125
We'll use the hole in the roof.

03:30.208 --> 03:33.166
But you have to get out there
without getting killed, and I know how.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.500
Go get the hostages.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.791
Maintain your position!

04:01.750 --> 04:03.000
Fire at three o'clock!

04:06.750 --> 04:07.666
Come on!

04:09.000 --> 04:10.250
Gandía!

04:13.916 --> 04:16.458
Come on!

04:16.541 --> 04:18.291
Take cover! Quick!

04:19.375 --> 04:20.375
Now!

04:25.708 --> 04:27.333
Everyone take cover!

04:56.666 --> 04:59.541
We'd often thought we were at war.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.416
But that was simply because

05:05.125 --> 05:07.000
we didn't know what war actually was.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.500
Frederiksborg Castle.

06:16.583 --> 06:19.083
It has tight security measures.

06:19.166 --> 06:22.958
Just to get in or out, you must go through
two arches with metal detectors

06:23.541 --> 06:25.791
and armed security guards.

06:25.875 --> 06:28.541
All that's before you reach the party.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.708
It'll be the perfect soiree.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.208
Fancy cars, tuxedos,

06:33.291 --> 06:36.291
cocktails, classical music
and 12 kilos of gold.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.416
Tatiana's fingers will work their magic.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.041
And all we have to do is enjoy the party.

06:44.166 --> 06:49.166
Why? By then, the trickiest part
of the job will have been taken care of.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.500
In fact, you'll have done it
the day before.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.041
-Me?
-Yes, you.

06:54.625 --> 06:57.958
You're the only one among us
with the plain, inconspicuous appearance

06:58.041 --> 06:59.291
of a piano tuner.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.541
What's this?

07:05.625 --> 07:06.458
Well,

07:08.083 --> 07:11.250
it's a magnetic stripe card reader,
a skimmer for cloning cards.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.916
Exactly!

07:13.000 --> 07:15.333
This will be concealed, right?

07:15.916 --> 07:20.333
This is normally used to steal
card information at ATMs and all that.

07:20.416 --> 07:23.666
Tatiana will suddenly feel indisposed.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.166
Nerves, the concert…

07:25.250 --> 07:26.375
I need some air.

07:26.875 --> 07:30.458
So you'll be left on your own
with a magnificent grand piano.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.041
You'll need help.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.083
This type of magnetic stripe card cloner

07:40.166 --> 07:42.500
requires you to be within ten centimeters

07:42.583 --> 07:44.541
of the card you want to clone

07:44.625 --> 07:46.500
for 30 seconds, obviously.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.791
That's easy,
they'll be hanging from their necks.

07:52.041 --> 07:54.541
Nothing a stubborn B-flat can't fix.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.958
Then your tool cart comes into play.

08:04.458 --> 08:07.208
That's where we'll hide the fake pieces.

08:09.208 --> 08:11.250
It's coated with barium sulfate,

08:12.333 --> 08:14.916
so an X-ray machine won't detect anything.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.500
They'll escort you to the safe place
where the pieces will be kept.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.583
From then on,
Hans will be the only problem.

08:31.666 --> 08:34.500
-Hans?
-The security guard at the gold room.

08:35.083 --> 08:36.500
He's always by the door.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.333
He never leaves.

08:38.416 --> 08:41.083
This man has no wife,

08:41.166 --> 08:44.458
no dog, no kids,

08:44.541 --> 08:47.833
and his father is senile.
What's his weak spot?

08:49.500 --> 08:52.250
I don't know. A second-degree relative?

08:52.833 --> 08:55.875
Why resort to a second-degree relative?
His father is senile.

08:55.958 --> 08:56.958
His father.

08:57.041 --> 08:58.125
His father's senile.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.708
He's in a sanitarium.
He doesn't recognize anyone anymore.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.958
-Bring in Cristoff.
-Copy that.

09:29.541 --> 09:30.458
Rafael.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.166
The briefcase.

09:53.583 --> 09:54.541
Thank you.

09:55.666 --> 09:56.583
We're in.

10:18.750 --> 10:19.958
Set Cristoff free.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.958
Walk towards the music, Cristoff.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.375
Towards the music.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.125
Cristoff is on the move.

10:34.541 --> 10:36.541
-Cameras?
-I'm accessing the system.

10:37.666 --> 10:38.666
Music.

10:40.416 --> 10:41.291
Music.

10:44.416 --> 10:45.541
I got it.

10:45.625 --> 10:46.750
It's on a loop.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.125
Music.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.500
Picture Hans's astonishment.

10:53.083 --> 10:55.291
He thinks his father is in a sanitarium,

10:55.916 --> 10:58.458
in slippers, watching Wheel of Fortune,

10:58.541 --> 10:59.791
and all of a sudden…

11:00.291 --> 11:03.666
Music.

11:04.958 --> 11:06.166
Music.

11:06.250 --> 11:10.708
This is Bear 3. Emergency in Room 1.
I need an immediate replacement in Room 1.

11:11.791 --> 11:12.708
Copy that, Bear 3.

11:13.208 --> 11:14.041
On my way.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.416
Rock and roll.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.625
There's something I haven't told you.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.708
I have absolutely no idea

11:48.791 --> 11:50.625
what's in there.

11:55.083 --> 11:56.583
Music.

11:59.375 --> 12:02.833
You never know
what you'll find in a secret vault.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.750
It's beautiful.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.708
Let's do it.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.500
They're encrypted safe-deposit boxes.

12:37.000 --> 12:37.958
Excuse me.

12:39.708 --> 12:42.708
And that is the key
that opens all the doors.

12:42.791 --> 12:45.125
Good. Which box contains the gold?

12:45.208 --> 12:49.041
The information is in here.
It's a matter of coding. I can hack it.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.166
This box is attached to a beam.
It's a fixed structure.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.416
Because the walls move.

13:02.750 --> 13:05.666
This is the most fascinating
security system I've ever seen.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.583
He just found his father.

13:12.666 --> 13:16.333
Don't grow too fond of it, son.
You've got one minute to blow it up.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.166
I can't do this in one minute, Dad.

13:20.958 --> 13:22.791
Jakov, it's an emergency.

13:22.875 --> 13:24.583
We need three minutes.

13:27.208 --> 13:30.708
-I can't do it in three minutes either.
-It's okay, don't worry.

13:30.791 --> 13:33.791
You'll have plenty of time
to figure it out in jail.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.125
Excuse me.

13:37.916 --> 13:40.375
I'm a doctor.
I think this gentleman doesn't feel well.

13:40.458 --> 13:43.250
He's disoriented.
It's nothing serious. Thanks.

13:43.750 --> 13:44.708
Come on, Dad.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.958
-Come on!
-I found the gold. I'm breaking the code.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.875
-How much longer?
-I don't know.

13:51.875 --> 13:52.708
Jakov.

13:53.958 --> 13:54.833
Two minutes.

13:58.666 --> 13:59.666
Got it!

14:25.208 --> 14:26.791
Excuse me.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.375
Out there…

14:29.250 --> 14:30.500
One minute, Jakov.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.958
He crossed the line with some ladies.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.500
What?

14:38.208 --> 14:41.583
The president of the foundation
almost called the police.

14:43.625 --> 14:44.583
What did he do?

14:45.666 --> 14:47.083
He said

14:47.958 --> 14:49.541
inappropriate things.

14:49.625 --> 14:50.541
What things?

14:53.916 --> 14:55.000
About…

14:56.916 --> 14:58.250
genitals.

15:05.708 --> 15:08.458
Did you see if he was with someone
or how he got here?

15:09.583 --> 15:10.625
Move aside.

15:11.666 --> 15:12.500
Come on, Dad.

15:13.541 --> 15:15.875
Andrés, Hans is suspicious.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.166
They're headed your way.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.166
Excuse me.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.125
Jakov, it's done.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.250
We're out.

16:15.708 --> 16:16.750
The adrenaline,

16:17.583 --> 16:18.583
the endorphins…

16:28.166 --> 16:30.416
You feel powerful. Don't you, son?

16:48.166 --> 16:49.458
It's amazing.

16:50.541 --> 16:53.500
The most important lesson comes now.

16:56.708 --> 16:58.166
That's it.

17:03.416 --> 17:05.208
What are you doing? No.

17:05.916 --> 17:06.750
Dad?

17:09.541 --> 17:10.375
Dad!

17:17.416 --> 17:19.166
-Why?
-I'm teaching you a lesson!

17:19.250 --> 17:21.541
A lesson? I can't believe this.

17:21.625 --> 17:25.750
You just threw away 12 kilos of gold.
That's 15 million euros.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.750
Teach me a lesson, my ass.

17:29.541 --> 17:30.375
Look at you.

17:32.958 --> 17:36.750
Only a thief can feel
that something they don't own is theirs.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.750
Now you know you're one of us.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.791
So, next time,

17:45.875 --> 17:49.541
leave that arrogance
and moral superiority behind

17:49.625 --> 17:53.166
and don't you ever
call your father a cynic again.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.041
Now it's time to enjoy ourselves.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.791
I came here to listen to Tatiana play.

18:07.375 --> 18:08.708
Bravo!

18:10.041 --> 18:12.083
The dream of any thief is

18:12.166 --> 18:15.125
to leave the place of the heist
surrounded by applause,

18:15.208 --> 18:19.125
people taking pictures, smiling,

18:19.875 --> 18:22.125
calm, determined

18:23.250 --> 18:24.291
and in love.

18:31.291 --> 18:32.458
And, above all,

18:32.958 --> 18:34.500
free of any suspicion.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.083
We'll leave the country undetected,

18:40.166 --> 18:43.541
in a beautiful, small boat,
celebrating Tatiana's success,

18:43.625 --> 18:45.333
headed to Malmö, Sweden.

18:45.916 --> 18:46.958
What's wrong with him?

18:48.125 --> 18:49.333
A tantrum.

18:49.875 --> 18:52.833
I never know
whether he's tired, hungry or gassy.

18:58.541 --> 19:00.375
My love, are you ready?

19:00.458 --> 19:01.708
Of course.

19:31.833 --> 19:33.083
Let's have a look!

19:40.833 --> 19:43.083
You expected us
to walk out the door with it?

19:58.833 --> 20:01.083
I never took you to play tennis.

20:04.416 --> 20:07.708
We never cycled up
a mountain pass together or went rowing.

20:08.583 --> 20:12.458
You wouldn't have learned anything new
from doing that with your father.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.375
But here, you will.

20:21.416 --> 20:23.666
If you really want something in life,

20:25.125 --> 20:27.416
you have to steal it from whomever has it.

20:34.416 --> 20:36.708
That's how the world works, my son.

20:59.458 --> 21:00.541
Now!

21:08.208 --> 21:09.791
We're here, Fatty. Don't worry.

21:12.708 --> 21:14.083
Stay calm, Fatty. I'm here.

21:27.958 --> 21:28.958
Arteche.

21:29.041 --> 21:30.166
Arteche!

21:30.666 --> 21:33.166
I can't hear anything. Tosco's injured.

21:36.083 --> 21:37.291
His pulse is very weak.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.500
It hit the femoral artery.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.833
We gotta make a fucking tourniquet.

21:46.333 --> 21:49.583
Breathe, Fatty.
We'll get you out of here, you hear me?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.958
Put it higher. Higher. Come on.

21:55.208 --> 21:56.375
Sagasta, do you copy?

21:56.458 --> 22:01.000
-What the hell is going on?
-It was a hostile rocket.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.708
I want a damage report now!

22:02.791 --> 22:05.833
Shut your fucking mouth, Colonel.
I have wounded men in here.

22:05.916 --> 22:09.166
Canalejas, we have to make
a trench to secure the perimeter--

22:15.291 --> 22:16.583
Hey, look at me.

22:16.666 --> 22:18.625
This is going to hurt. Ready?

22:19.125 --> 22:20.625
Three, two, one.

22:22.583 --> 22:25.750
Get the bomb disposal robot.
Any second now, we'll go in from below.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.208
We're going up!

22:30.291 --> 22:33.500
It's your lucky day.
We're running a drill, like in school.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.375
So keep quiet and get in line.

22:35.458 --> 22:37.250
You're the infantry now.

22:37.333 --> 22:40.833
Matías, the backpacks with the equipment.
We're going to the roof.

22:40.916 --> 22:41.750
Copy that.

22:45.166 --> 22:46.625
Come on, move!

22:51.000 --> 22:54.291
Palermo, cut my fucking leg off.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.208
Cut it off.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.000
Look at me.

22:57.708 --> 23:00.583
I won't cut your leg off,
you hear me? I won't.

23:00.666 --> 23:01.916
Palermo,

23:02.416 --> 23:05.041
my femur, tibia and knee are shattered.

23:05.916 --> 23:07.166
Everything.

23:08.833 --> 23:13.333
They'll cut it off in the hospital.
You know damn well, Palermo.

23:14.958 --> 23:18.416
This will make you feel better.
We'll get you out. Stop being stupid.

23:19.583 --> 23:22.083
Fatty, stay calm. I'm here with you.

23:22.166 --> 23:23.208
Look at me, Mirko.

23:23.291 --> 23:25.041
Hey, look at me.

23:27.916 --> 23:28.875
He's right.

23:30.541 --> 23:33.000
It's a marble column.
It weighs at least two tons.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.375
We can't move it, Palermo.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.166
I'll cut it off.

23:55.625 --> 23:58.833
No, let's find a fucking lever
and move the statue!

24:01.458 --> 24:02.750
We need something strong.

24:11.833 --> 24:13.250
Back stairs.

24:14.416 --> 24:16.458
The snipers have to think you're hostages.

24:16.541 --> 24:20.291
Have half of them remove their masks.
You've got one minute to get up there.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.958
You're going to play
the role of your lives!

24:23.041 --> 24:25.250
I want an Oscar-winning performance!

24:25.333 --> 24:27.208
Is that clear? Come on!

24:27.708 --> 24:28.708
That's it.

24:29.791 --> 24:30.625
Come on!

24:31.666 --> 24:33.833
Ms. Tokyo, wait. I have a stitch.

24:33.916 --> 24:35.541
Come on, we're almost there.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.541
Pass me a bandage, Bogotá.

24:38.125 --> 24:39.666
-Don't fall asleep.
-Hang in there.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.166
-Stay calm, Fatty.
-Hang in there.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.333
It looks much better.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.000
Fatty, hey.

24:50.666 --> 24:52.166
You're with me, right?

24:52.250 --> 24:54.083
-Palermo.
-Open your eyes.

24:54.166 --> 24:56.125
Keep your eyes open, Fatty.

24:56.208 --> 24:59.500
Helsinki. Look at me, Fatty, please.

24:59.583 --> 25:03.375
Look at me. Come on, Fatty!
Fatty, look at me, for fuck's sake!

25:04.125 --> 25:05.250
Don't go. Look at me.

25:12.583 --> 25:14.666
Palermo, would that beam work?

25:17.875 --> 25:18.791
Cover us.

25:18.875 --> 25:20.166
Thank you.

25:21.375 --> 25:23.875
Lisbon, hurry up. We need covering fire.

25:27.958 --> 25:30.166
We're going out. Everybody ready?

25:30.666 --> 25:33.791
-They're going to kill us!
-Nobody's going to kill you.

25:33.875 --> 25:36.916
I might kill you
for being so annoying, but they won't.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.250
They won't kill any of you

25:38.333 --> 25:41.291
'cause half of you will remove
your masks. Is that clear?

25:41.375 --> 25:43.583
Make sure they can see you're hostages.

25:43.666 --> 25:47.833
You'll remove your mask.
You too. You and you too, darling.

25:47.916 --> 25:48.875
Okay, good.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.333
Masks.

25:54.875 --> 25:55.708
Professor.

25:56.750 --> 25:59.958
Bomb squad. They're preparing
to enter at the ground floor.

26:02.958 --> 26:05.208
Let's go!

26:07.958 --> 26:09.833
They're preparing a second attack.

26:09.916 --> 26:12.375
Why'd you release the governor?
Tell me there's a plan.

26:12.458 --> 26:14.875
We hid a microphone in the handcuffs.

26:14.958 --> 26:18.208
I thought we'd have a chance
if the handcuffs were removed

26:18.291 --> 26:21.083
before they were searched
with the radio frequency detector.

26:22.083 --> 26:24.833
We're getting him out.
And I'll tell you why.

26:29.583 --> 26:30.541
And?

26:32.916 --> 26:35.208
We've got Tamayo by the balls.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.166
Contact Pakistan.

26:37.708 --> 26:40.708
You're the sexiest woman in the world,
but I love you for your mind.

26:40.791 --> 26:45.041
I'm a little busy with a war here.
Let's talk dirty later.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.291
Sounds good.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.875
Benjamín, call your men.

26:52.375 --> 26:54.041
Let's prepare the foundry.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.208
Alicia.

26:55.291 --> 27:00.000
Marseille, go out and buy pacifiers,
diapers, a crib. Anything that's needed.

27:00.083 --> 27:02.166
Are you breast- or bottle-feeding?

27:02.750 --> 27:06.083
Breast and bottle, okay? Let's do it all.

27:06.666 --> 27:10.083
And bring something for his foot.
He didn't notice that I shot him.

27:10.166 --> 27:15.083
By the way, I think you should give
your cartridge clip to Marseille.

27:15.791 --> 27:17.291
For everyone's safety.

27:37.375 --> 27:38.250
Thank you.

27:41.083 --> 27:43.750
Professor, we're on the roof.

27:43.833 --> 27:47.375
Good. Tokyo, it's important
that they don't see you're armed.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.833
Keep the equipment inside the weapon bag.

27:50.625 --> 27:53.750
Tie one end of a rope to the bag
and the other end to one of you.

27:53.833 --> 27:57.708
You'll get to the hole in the roof
by hiding among the hostages.

27:57.791 --> 27:59.625
Matías, we need your help.

27:59.708 --> 28:03.208
As soon as I say "stampede,"
shoot to distract the snipers.

28:03.291 --> 28:06.458
Then pull the rope
and retrieve the bag. Understood?

28:12.041 --> 28:14.750
Palermo. Stockholm and I are in position.

28:16.583 --> 28:18.041
Lisbon, smoke in five,

28:19.541 --> 28:21.000
four,

28:21.708 --> 28:22.541
three,

28:23.750 --> 28:26.291
two, one.

28:27.750 --> 28:28.666
Good luck.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.083
Now!

28:31.416 --> 28:32.666
Smoke!

28:34.916 --> 28:36.083
Covering fire!

28:39.166 --> 28:40.625
I have no visual!

28:42.583 --> 28:43.500
Come on, Rio.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.625
Tokyo, now.

28:58.500 --> 28:59.375
Don't shoot!

29:00.458 --> 29:02.916
I'm Miguel Fernández Talanilla
from Totana, Murcia.

29:03.750 --> 29:05.958
They're on the roof
and are removing their masks.

29:09.375 --> 29:11.791
If anyone goes near the hole, open fire.

29:11.875 --> 29:12.833
Copy that.

29:13.916 --> 29:16.000
The robot. Enter through the door now.

29:16.083 --> 29:19.083
They can't handle the commando
and hostages at the same time.

29:19.166 --> 29:20.875
-Now's the time.
-You got it.

29:23.625 --> 29:24.750
Don't shoot!

29:28.166 --> 29:30.291
Exit achieved, Professor.

29:31.458 --> 29:32.625
Come on!

29:35.791 --> 29:37.166
Bandage, now!

29:37.250 --> 29:39.250
We're running out of smoke. Hurry!

29:39.333 --> 29:41.541
Come on, Rio! We have to get out of here!

29:42.041 --> 29:44.583
-Come on!
-Come on!

29:51.833 --> 29:53.666
Bogotá! Are you okay?

30:07.291 --> 30:09.166
Hang in there!

30:17.333 --> 30:18.916
I'm waiting for the green light.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.666
Palermo, give the order.

30:20.750 --> 30:22.166
Give the order now!

30:22.250 --> 30:24.125
Hold on up there. We're freeing Helsinki.

30:24.208 --> 30:25.750
We don't have much time.

30:25.833 --> 30:29.583
Once we get him out, we'll be the bait
to lure them out of the trench.

30:29.666 --> 30:30.916
Chuikov!

30:31.000 --> 30:33.375
Don't get close
to the hole until I tell you to.

30:36.041 --> 30:38.041
Don't shoot!

30:48.541 --> 30:50.291
-Get ready to intervene.
-Copy that.

30:51.166 --> 30:52.458
Let's go!

31:00.625 --> 31:01.916
In position, sir.

31:05.291 --> 31:07.875
UNKNOWN NUMBER

31:09.041 --> 31:11.708
Sir, we're ready.

31:14.625 --> 31:15.708
Wait a minute.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.000
Hello?

31:18.916 --> 31:20.041
You're connected.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.125
Don't raise your tiny hand

31:22.208 --> 31:26.000
because you don't want anyone
to overhear this conversation.

31:26.500 --> 31:29.041
Tell me, do you do yoga
or something like that?

31:29.125 --> 31:30.041
Capoeira.

31:30.750 --> 31:32.916
That's why you're so flexible.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.125
You're so flexible that you can dodge
problems, resignations, responsibilities.

31:38.208 --> 31:40.958
With such flexibility,
you must be an excellent lover.

31:41.041 --> 31:44.291
I am, but this conversation
is starting to disgust me a bit.

31:44.375 --> 31:46.041
Tell me what the fuck you want.

31:48.541 --> 31:49.500
Proceed.

31:50.666 --> 31:53.958
They didn't revive anyone,
and they killed him in cold blood.

31:54.041 --> 31:57.041
It would be best if he died
in the next ten minutes.

31:57.625 --> 32:01.166
This is a gift, and I'll use it
to finish them off. No law, no rights!

32:01.250 --> 32:04.583
We'll shoot them in the back
even if they surrender!

32:04.666 --> 32:06.291
And that's why

32:06.375 --> 32:09.333
I need everyone
to think they're fucking murderers.

32:10.166 --> 32:11.416
What are you after?

32:12.875 --> 32:15.791
-I want a just war.
-That doesn't exist.

32:15.875 --> 32:19.458
Tamayo, you sent
eight elite soldiers into the bank.

32:19.958 --> 32:23.333
I have ten thieves inside.
I think it's quite balanced.

32:24.041 --> 32:26.333
I don't want to see any more movements.

32:26.416 --> 32:28.750
You think that recording will stop me? 

32:28.833 --> 32:33.583
Colonel, you started a war
to save yourself without qualms or ethics.

32:34.791 --> 32:36.541
I'm only asking that you continue.

32:37.875 --> 32:40.083
Either you stop the second attack,

32:40.166 --> 32:44.666
or I'll prove it was you who fabricated
evidence against Alicia Sierra,

32:44.750 --> 32:48.708
that it was you who ordered
payment from the reserve funds,

32:48.791 --> 32:52.916
and I'll transfer ten million to a company
in the Dutch Antilles, in your name.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.708
And, believe me, that operation
will link you directly to me.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.125
Postpone the intervention.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.333
That's not the order I expected.

33:22.541 --> 33:26.708
You don't get calls from the president
or report to the government, do you?

33:26.791 --> 33:31.916
Then go munch on some fucking cookies
and let me give the orders.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.458
-Help!
-Tokyo!

33:47.541 --> 33:48.583
Don't shoot!

33:48.666 --> 33:50.958
Don't shoot! We're hostages!

33:51.041 --> 33:53.041
What's wrong?

33:53.125 --> 33:54.708
-I'm fine.
-What happened?

33:54.791 --> 33:56.208
-Nothing.
-What happened?

33:56.958 --> 34:00.041
All this might be
just a bit too much for me,

34:00.125 --> 34:01.791
but I'm fine, really.

34:02.750 --> 34:07.083
I used to rob gas stations, man.
And now the Army is out there.

34:07.166 --> 34:08.625
It's okay. You're not alone.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.875
It's okay.
I'm not alone. Everything's fine.

34:11.958 --> 34:12.875
Let's go.

34:14.041 --> 34:15.041
Relax.

34:15.125 --> 34:16.041
It's okay.

34:16.625 --> 34:17.750
Look at me.

34:18.250 --> 34:21.541
Don't close your eyes, okay? Look at me.

34:22.041 --> 34:23.541
-Tell me a story.
-What?

34:23.625 --> 34:25.833
Whatever you want. 
How did you end up here?

34:26.583 --> 34:29.875
Well, the other heist went so well.

34:30.583 --> 34:32.291
But this one, not so much.

34:32.375 --> 34:35.291
And I wanted
to spend time with this weirdo.

34:36.125 --> 34:38.625
But from the time I got to the monastery,

34:38.708 --> 34:42.125
I knew this wasn't going to go well.

34:42.208 --> 34:43.583
Why is that?

34:49.583 --> 34:53.875
Because you were there
with your wife, with a child, like…

34:53.958 --> 34:56.458
You looked like a picture-perfect family.

34:57.083 --> 34:59.583
And I felt so stupid…

35:01.958 --> 35:02.875
Stupid? Why?

35:03.625 --> 35:06.041
Because I've been in love
with him all my life.

35:06.125 --> 35:08.666
Stop fooling around.
It's no time for jokes.

35:09.166 --> 35:10.916
It's not a joke, sweetie.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.458
It's not a joke. But since we might die,

35:13.541 --> 35:15.875
because this is getting ugly,
I'm saying it.

35:15.958 --> 35:18.791
No, I'm saying it to get it off my chest.

35:18.875 --> 35:20.625
No, okay? Listen to me.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.625
Nobody's going to die. You hear me?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.375
-Say it.
-Nobody's going to die.

35:32.458 --> 35:34.250
-Good. Okay?
-Okay.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.416
Life goes on, right?

35:42.916 --> 35:44.750
-Life goes on.
-That's right.

35:51.666 --> 35:53.250
Pull him as if you were an ox!

35:53.750 --> 35:55.208
Professor, Helsinki's out.

35:58.125 --> 36:01.083
Matías, get ready to shoot on my command.

36:01.166 --> 36:02.500
Yes, Professor.

36:03.083 --> 36:05.500
Tokyo, Manila, Denver, get ready.

36:05.583 --> 36:06.916
Let's get ready.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Follow me, okay?

36:08.583 --> 36:10.583
Matías, stampede.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.333
By the door! Shoot!

36:32.333 --> 36:33.625
Fire!

36:46.666 --> 36:49.666
They're approaching the hole.
I request permission to shoot.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.125
You can't shoot. They're hostages!

36:52.708 --> 36:53.958
I have a visual, sir.

36:56.166 --> 36:58.916
Visibility is reducing.
I request permission to shoot.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.416
They're civilians running
from the line of fire. Permission denied.

37:54.625 --> 37:56.416
Bogotá, Rio, let them advance.

37:57.791 --> 38:00.625
They're backing off.
Full-court press, now!

38:06.375 --> 38:07.500
Tokyo.

38:08.083 --> 38:10.833
They left their nest. Wait for my signal.

38:26.291 --> 38:27.541
Not yet.

38:34.500 --> 38:35.958
-Now!
-Now!

38:38.041 --> 38:39.291
Fire at six o'clock!

38:52.125 --> 38:53.208
Let's go!

39:38.833 --> 39:40.250
Fuck, girl.

39:40.333 --> 39:43.041
We get an hour to rest and they all fuck.

39:43.125 --> 39:45.416
What is this? A camp for teenagers?

39:46.416 --> 39:49.166
If Rio were here,
what do you think you'd be doing?

39:51.166 --> 39:53.625
There are a ton of saints
and Jesuses in here.

39:53.708 --> 39:57.083
They're my boyfriends. And my bodyguards.

39:57.875 --> 39:59.375
They protect me and Helsinki.

40:02.916 --> 40:03.833
Shit.

40:04.958 --> 40:06.625
This one should stay behind.

40:06.708 --> 40:11.416
Sorry to say, but I don't know if I want
them all showing up the day I die.

40:11.916 --> 40:12.750
I see.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.833
What do you think happens?

40:21.708 --> 40:23.291
When we get shot in the head?

40:26.416 --> 40:27.791
Do you believe in heaven?

40:30.458 --> 40:31.958
Actually…

40:32.041 --> 40:32.916
no.

40:34.000 --> 40:34.833
Really?

40:35.541 --> 40:36.375
Nothing.

40:38.291 --> 40:39.416
That's what you believe?

40:41.458 --> 40:42.541
That everything's over?

40:43.375 --> 40:44.708
Not everything.

40:44.791 --> 40:46.083
Your memory lives on.

40:52.333 --> 40:54.541
How would you like to be remembered?

40:57.166 --> 40:59.708
I don't know. I guess…

41:01.416 --> 41:03.750
I'd like people to say

41:05.083 --> 41:06.875
they felt things with me.

41:07.750 --> 41:10.208
But real things.

41:11.500 --> 41:14.541
I don't know,
like friendship, for example.

41:14.625 --> 41:18.375
You know those people who say,
"I have tons of friends"?

41:18.458 --> 41:19.583
So?

41:20.416 --> 41:22.000
You don't need to have them.

41:22.083 --> 41:23.541
You need to feel them.

41:25.500 --> 41:29.416
Don't you think Helsinki will remember me
every fucking Christmas?

41:35.666 --> 41:37.500
I'll remember you saying…

41:39.500 --> 41:40.541
"I'll go."

41:41.541 --> 41:42.500
I'll go where?

41:45.583 --> 41:48.208
Into the lion's den
to rescue my boyfriend.

41:48.916 --> 41:50.000
Come on.

41:51.666 --> 41:52.708
Babe…

42:06.416 --> 42:08.125
I do think there's something.

42:10.541 --> 42:11.458
Actually,

42:12.916 --> 42:13.750
I think…

42:16.041 --> 42:19.875
that you keep living
in the last thought you have before dying.

42:23.083 --> 42:26.125
That's why, when things get crazy,
I think of when I was happy.

42:28.083 --> 42:29.625
And in those memories,

42:31.416 --> 42:33.416
I'll stay and live forever.

42:38.208 --> 42:39.541
That's a great plan.

42:46.875 --> 42:49.875
-What? Who's next door?
-Come on. Who do you think?

42:49.958 --> 42:51.166
-No.
-Of course!

42:51.250 --> 42:53.541
Yeah, Aikido, Professor!

42:53.625 --> 42:55.500
Aikido all the way, man!

42:55.583 --> 42:57.041
Shut up!

43:04.416 --> 43:05.666
Who's in charge here?

43:06.250 --> 43:07.416
Major Sagasta.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.333
Sagasta, you're surrounded.

43:10.333 --> 43:12.791
Throw your weapons
into the middle of the room, now.

43:12.875 --> 43:15.541
Come and get them, pillow-biter!

43:15.625 --> 43:17.416
Sagasta, update.

43:17.500 --> 43:20.416
Send in the second detachment.
The whole gang is here.

43:20.500 --> 43:23.791
Even the postman and his mom
could walk in the main door right now.

43:24.291 --> 43:25.958
Sagasta, you have to resist.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.041
There won't be a second detachment.

43:33.875 --> 43:37.375
They snuck in right under your nose
and now you leave us high and dry.

43:39.708 --> 43:40.791
Over and out.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.750
Arteche, what do you think?

43:49.833 --> 43:53.000
We're between two fronts.
We need to get rid of one.

43:57.583 --> 43:59.666
Sagasta, you've got ten seconds.

44:00.458 --> 44:03.125
Gandía, can you activate
the museum's security lock?

44:03.208 --> 44:06.250
Affirmative.
There's a fingerprint reader in the room.

44:06.333 --> 44:07.416
Seven seconds!

44:10.541 --> 44:14.083
Okay, four corners. Wait for my order.

44:19.333 --> 44:20.750
Five seconds!

44:23.791 --> 44:24.791
Four!

44:28.375 --> 44:29.625
Three!

44:31.208 --> 44:32.375
Two!

44:33.041 --> 44:36.500
All right! We'll drop our weapons.

44:36.583 --> 44:40.000
Hands on your heads!
Get down on the ground, damn it!

44:40.083 --> 44:41.166
Okay.

44:44.041 --> 44:45.958
We're going to drop our weapons.

44:49.083 --> 44:50.666
I don't like this one bit.

44:50.750 --> 44:52.041
Now!

44:53.000 --> 44:54.083
Grenade!

44:57.458 --> 44:58.583
Get back!

45:17.375 --> 45:18.333
Fuck!

45:28.125 --> 45:30.375
-What's happening, Lisbon?
-Grenades!

45:30.458 --> 45:33.833
-We've retreated to the museum.
-Don't lose sight of Tokyo's group.

45:40.625 --> 45:42.166
Tokyo, keep going!

45:44.833 --> 45:45.708
Impossible.

45:45.791 --> 45:46.833
I have no visual.

46:07.583 --> 46:10.083
They're lowering the doors.
There's a security lock.

46:10.166 --> 46:11.375
A security lock?

46:12.500 --> 46:14.375
That's impossible. It's not in the plans.

46:14.458 --> 46:16.541
They must have installed them afterwards

46:16.625 --> 46:19.166
'cause three doors are closing, Professor.

46:24.291 --> 46:26.333
Come on!

46:41.541 --> 46:42.750
Go to the kitchen.

47:29.416 --> 47:31.916
Tokyo!

47:34.125 --> 47:36.541
A little bird just told me Nairobi

47:36.625 --> 47:43.000
is saving you a place in heaven.
