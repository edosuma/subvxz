00:46.047 --> 00:49.173

- No!

00:50.176 --> 00:53.385
<i> Tonight is</i>

Welcome to "the masked singer"
and our group a semi-finals!

01:44.980 --> 01:47.106
Robin: Yeah!

01:47.149 --> 01:50.859
The contenders are four
very different singers,

01:50.903 --> 01:53.862
each one bringing
something uniquely special
to this competition.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.864
But we can't get too attached

01:55.908 --> 01:59.576
because two of them
are getting unmasked tonight.

01:59.578 --> 02:02.204
- Yes.
- Aw, man.

02:02.248 --> 02:04.373
It's double elimination night
here at "the masked singer."

02:04.416 --> 02:05.582
no!

02:05.626 --> 02:07.417
But first, let's give it up

02:07.461 --> 02:10.129
for our celebrity detectives.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.592
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

02:15.636 --> 02:17.386
Thank you.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.264
And, since it's our
high-stakes semi-final,

02:20.266 --> 02:22.850
we got a superstar
in the building.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.185
We must treat him as such.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.729
I got a feeling y'all
already know who this is.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.023
Say it with me.
Take it off!

02:30.067 --> 02:31.984
( chanting )
take it off! Take it off!

02:32.027 --> 02:35.445
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, he got the moves.

02:35.447 --> 02:38.824
Uh-oh. Will.I.Am!

02:38.868 --> 02:41.702
Judge on "alter ego"

02:41.745 --> 02:45.289
and founding and lead member
of the black eyed peas.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.499
- Salute, king.
- Chilling, bro.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.084
How you doing, man?

02:49.128 --> 02:51.670
Aw, man.
I'm not-- I thought
I was chilling,

02:51.714 --> 02:54.047
but then I saw your neck.

02:54.091 --> 02:57.050
This is-- it's cold up here.
It's drippy.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.343
You got all
the connecting parts.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.887
You got the wrist, the neck.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.263
- Totally.
- Ankles.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.848
I'm a glacier of a host.

03:04.435 --> 03:07.686
All right, will,
let me catch you up
on what's going on so far.

03:07.730 --> 03:11.940
We've added something new called
the take it off buzzer, y'all.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.275
Whoo!

03:13.319 --> 03:16.445
- Nicole: Wow.
- Nick: Oh, yes.

03:16.447 --> 03:19.239
Steaming hot.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.407
That's scary,
that take it off buzzer.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.910
Nick:
It's about to get good.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.328
Nicole: Some danger.
That's dangerous.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.872
This is how they serve
nick's dinner.

03:28.375 --> 03:32.878
Now, the take it off buzzer
can only be hit once per group,

03:32.922 --> 03:37.507
and that's only
if you are 100% certain

03:37.551 --> 03:40.886
that you know who the superstar
is behind the mask.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.512
They gotta stop everything
they doing,

03:42.556 --> 03:45.224
take it off, and then they're
headed home immediately.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.060
So don't screw it up
for any of us.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.427
All right,
well, let's get to it.

03:49.438 --> 03:52.105

was very vulnerable.

04:04.787 --> 04:08.288

07:37.791 --> 07:41.126
Well, tonight we're
seeing how our singers
are connected to the panel.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.336

to the panelist

07:43.380 --> 07:45.922
that our singer
has a connection with.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.049

by using a contraption

07:48.093 --> 07:50.969

09:20.894 --> 09:22.852
billy porter was on
the new year's eve show

09:22.896 --> 09:25.313

in the new year.

all they do

09:45.252 --> 09:47.377

09:49.089 --> 09:50.505

have to worry because

Welcome back
to "the masked singer"
group a semi-finals.

10:30.005 --> 10:33.923
- Yes.
- Tonight, two singers
are getting unmasked,

10:33.967 --> 10:36.176
and pepper is up next.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.428
<i> What's inspiring</i>
<i> tonight's performance?</i>

10:38.472 --> 10:40.096
Let's find out.

10:43.185 --> 10:46.853
You know, joining
the competition just a few
days before it started,

10:46.897 --> 10:48.813
I really had to adjust
very quickly.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.484
<i> I can't believe that I made it</i>
<i> to the semi-finals.</i>

10:52.527 --> 10:54.903
You're rapidly becoming
one of my favorites.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.863
Amazing job.

10:56.907 --> 11:00.325
<i> My whole goal is just to</i>
<i>explore another side of myself.</i>

11:00.360 --> 11:02.869
<i> I kind of had,</i>
<i> like, a good girl thing</i>
<i> for a long time,</i>

11:02.913 --> 11:07.374
<i> and with the pepper</i>
<i> comes a lot of spice</i>
<i> and hotness and energy.</i>

11:07.376 --> 11:11.836
<i> Tonight, I'm gonna really</i>
<i> dig into my ability</i>

11:11.880 --> 11:14.297
<i> to tell a story.</i>

11:14.299 --> 11:16.007
<i> All the songs</i>
<i> I've sung so far,</i>

11:16.051 --> 11:17.634
<i> they've got a lot</i>
<i> of emotion in them,</i>

11:17.678 --> 11:19.886
<i> like recovering from pain.</i>

11:19.930 --> 11:21.346
<i> But the hardest thing</i>
<i> I've experienced</i>

11:21.390 --> 11:24.849
<i> is watching the one I love</i>
<i> and care for most</i>

11:24.893 --> 11:26.309
<i> face the unthinkable.</i>

11:26.353 --> 11:27.560
Wow.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.146
I just remember
wanting things to get better.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.358

of that.

- Give it to me, daddy.

jenny: Train.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.985
Ken, not even gravity

14:22.028 --> 14:23.987
could stop that train
from getting to you.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.448
- Gravity. Gravity.
- What is going on?

14:27.492 --> 14:30.034
Okay, honestly,

14:30.078 --> 14:33.329
I know exactly

14:33.373 --> 14:36.958
- who this is.
- Nicole: ...This is.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.252
Nick: You said that like you
seriously know.
Ken: No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.546
Where's
the take it off buzzer?

14:41.590 --> 14:43.089
- Yeah!
- No!

14:43.091 --> 14:47.760
- Let's go.

14:47.804 --> 14:48.803
Ken:
The take it off buzzer!

14:49.097 --> 14:52.223
- Jenny: Ken! No!
- Take it off! Take it off!

14:52.267 --> 14:54.392
- Don't do it!
- I got you.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.020
Ken! Are you really
gonna hit it?

14:57.063 --> 15:00.106
- I'm really gonna do this.
- You don't want to
get it wrong.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.233
This is not a joke.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.445
I honestly believe the pepper

15:05.447 --> 15:08.197
is sarah bareilles.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.240
( crowd gasps )

15:09.242 --> 15:12.285
she was a guest star
on "community"

15:12.329 --> 15:15.079
in a scene with me,
and I've been a fan ever since.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.040
- Is he right?
- "gravity."

15:17.083 --> 15:18.917
that's an amazing
sarah bareilles song.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.836
Also, if you look
at the clue package
right now-- storyteller.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.882
She wrote the entire broadway
adaptation of "waitress."

15:25.926 --> 15:28.217
- yes.
- But what about the train?

15:28.261 --> 15:31.262
Let me tell you about
the train, will.I.Am!

15:31.264 --> 15:33.890
- Can I, will?
- "can I, will."

15:33.934 --> 15:35.975
I am good friends with
the lead singer of train,
pat monahan.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.518
He's one of my best friends.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.980
And sarah bareilles
has a song with common

15:41.024 --> 15:42.357
called "the train."

15:42.400 --> 15:43.942
jenny:
He's kinda selling it.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.902
( crowd cheering )

15:45.946 --> 15:49.489
I'm very confident
that the pepper

15:49.532 --> 15:54.285
is sarah bareilles.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.329
No!

21:55.189 --> 21:57.231
We got it.
No cause for alarm.

21:57.233 --> 22:01.569
- "cake."
- hey, twisted neighbor!

22:01.571 --> 22:04.655
Have you cake and eat it.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.033
Oh! He lives next to you.

22:07.076 --> 22:09.327
That's scary.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.872
That doesn't really
give me a clue. Cake.

22:12.915 --> 22:15.333
All I can think of is rihanna
when I hear "cake, cake, cake."

22:15.335 --> 22:19.420
- well, I'm not rihanna.
- Nick: We know that.

22:19.464 --> 22:22.840
Um, you know, the last
performance you did

22:22.884 --> 22:25.593
was an incredible metal,
rock performance,

22:25.595 --> 22:27.094
but this was so different.

22:27.129 --> 22:30.598
This was, uh,
interpretive dance.

22:30.641 --> 22:33.351
Please help me.

22:33.394 --> 22:36.854
Will.I.Am:
Okay, maybe you are, like,
a true rocker.

22:36.898 --> 22:38.898
I heard your accent
through your singing.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.233
So you are, like,
british for real.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.277
You are joe elliot
from def leppard,

22:43.321 --> 22:45.988
because you sang
"pour some sugar on me,"

22:46.032 --> 22:48.032
and that's an ingredient
in cake.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.993
- Ooh.
- Oh!

22:51.037 --> 22:54.163
- Ken: Respect.
- Ken, who is it?

22:54.165 --> 22:58.417
Last week it said this is
one of the most influential
people of all time.

22:58.461 --> 23:02.129
This could be elon musk.
He's hosted snl.

23:02.131 --> 23:05.591
Hear me out. Let me finish
before you start laughing.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.134
How dare you, robin?

23:07.178 --> 23:09.512
- I put a lot of...
- Sorry, I wasn't expecting

23:09.555 --> 23:11.055
- you to say elon musk.
- ...Dramatic thought
into this guess.

23:11.099 --> 23:15.184
- It all fits. It all fits.
- Will: Wow. Wow.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.186
Did you just say that?

23:17.230 --> 23:18.354
This is what the jester
has done to us.

23:18.398 --> 23:22.525
Now, I'm saying
it could be elon musk,

23:22.568 --> 23:25.403
who is very influential.

23:25.446 --> 23:28.239
But then could it be--
maybe this is simon cowell?

23:28.241 --> 23:30.157
He's got that kind of vibe.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.951
Yeah, he's got
this kind of body, too.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.994
- You've worked with simon.
- He's my man.

23:33.996 --> 23:36.038
He looks exactly
like simon cowell to me.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.581
That's not a bad guess.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.292
That's how he stretches out
in the green room.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.255
Now, robin, are any of those
people your neighbors?

23:44.257 --> 23:45.881
No. It's a big neighborhood.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.342
But I'm gonna go with somebody
a little different--

23:48.386 --> 23:51.345
him and I do have some
neighborly history together--

23:51.389 --> 23:53.889
would be flea from
the red hot chili peppers.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.307
Nick: All right.
That's a good--

23:55.393 --> 23:57.226
- wow. That's a good guess.
- Yeah, that's good, robin.

23:57.228 --> 24:00.187
Great guesses up there
and a great job up here.

24:00.231 --> 24:04.650
- Slither on backstage.
- Huggy!

24:04.694 --> 24:06.152
Hee-hee!

24:06.195 --> 24:09.613
Keep it going for him, y'all.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.115
Who is this?

24:11.159 --> 24:14.952
This was a challenge
to see if I could drive

24:14.996 --> 24:18.247
through this competition
with proper dignity.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.916

I've said it once,

we are not worthy.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.232
You had robin
standing up on the desk.

28:13.234 --> 28:16.110
Oh, I get so--
like, when you sing,

28:16.153 --> 28:17.986
I hang on
to your every note.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.030
I can't wait

28:20.074 --> 28:22.199
And I just-- I can't get
enough of your voice.

28:22.243 --> 28:25.202
Thank you.
Thank you for that.

28:25.246 --> 28:27.788
Um, there are certain people
that can sing,

28:27.832 --> 28:31.667
then there's certain people
that have this special quality

28:31.711 --> 28:34.044
to just make you feel
what they're feeling.

28:34.088 --> 28:37.423
You've got that.
It's like, wow.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.258
Nick: Well said.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.260
So, it's time to find out
who the skunk

28:41.303 --> 28:43.262
- has a connection with.
- Uh-oh.

28:43.305 --> 28:46.265
Men in black,
it's time to get back
with this bling shot.

28:46.267 --> 28:48.016
This one's for nicole.

28:48.060 --> 28:52.062
- Nicole, it's coming your way.
- Oh, snap!

28:52.106 --> 28:54.982
- Don't hurt nobody.
- Oh, my gosh.

28:55.025 --> 28:57.359
Come on, nick.
Let's focus.

28:57.394 --> 28:59.486
Robin:
Put some stank on it.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.615
Oh, my god!

29:03.659 --> 29:06.076
- Oh, my--
- touchdown!

29:06.120 --> 29:10.289
- Whoo! "love."
- jenny: "love."

29:10.332 --> 29:14.001
- I like this clue.
- Nicole, I think you could say

29:14.044 --> 29:18.172
that we have
a love connection.

29:18.174 --> 29:20.090
Nick: Maybe y'all
worked together before?

29:20.134 --> 29:21.958
Did you date
the same person?

29:21.969 --> 29:25.053
- Ooh.
- No. We both like, "no."

29:25.097 --> 29:29.224
I think it could be
mary j. Blige.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.310
One of her biggest songs
is "real love."

29:31.353 --> 29:32.227
woman: Yeah!

29:32.271 --> 29:34.438
She got excited
in the audience.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.774
She said, "yeah!"

29:36.776 --> 29:40.819
or I'm feeling
what robin's been thinking
this whole time as well.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.447
Yeah. I feel like
I know this voice.

29:43.491 --> 29:46.033
The reason is 'cause I believe
I sang a duet with her

29:46.076 --> 29:48.410
on one of my albums,
and I think this faith evans.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.122
You know who I'm thinking?

29:52.166 --> 29:53.957
We've mentioned
this name before.

29:54.001 --> 29:57.002
She has a few songs--
"love rain," "it's love."

29:57.046 --> 29:59.588
I think all signs
are pointing to jill scott.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.840
- All right.
- Good guess.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.301
- That could be it, too.
- I think the "love" pillow--

30:04.345 --> 30:07.179
and I don't know how this
relates to you, nicole,
maybe you can figure it out.

30:07.223 --> 30:10.974
- Diddy has changed
his name to love.
- Oh!

30:11.018 --> 30:13.185
- That's right. Sorry.
- That's what it is.

30:13.229 --> 30:17.064
But diddy also
has a connection
to mary j. Blige.

30:17.107 --> 30:21.235
Right, so it could be
mary j. Blige or faith evans
in the "love" connection.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.028
Oh, my god, it could be,
'cause of puff.

30:23.030 --> 30:23.862
- Yeah.
- Yes.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.240
And-- and-- and--
and mary j. Blige

30:26.283 --> 30:29.952
gave me some of her wine
for christmas last year,

30:29.995 --> 30:31.578
and I loved it.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.959
And what we loved
was this legendary
performance, right?

30:37.002 --> 30:39.127
That was amazing.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.255
I just can't believe two people
are going home tonight.

30:41.298 --> 30:43.674
It's going to be impossible.

30:43.717 --> 30:47.052
Hi, it's me again,
miss masky.

30:47.096 --> 30:49.054
Are you as lost as the panel?

30:49.098 --> 30:51.473
Well, skunk gave me
this big clue.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.476
Does it give you some
direction to who she is?

30:55.479 --> 30:56.478
<i> ♪ who is that? </i>

31:00.401 --> 31:05.404
Well, it's been a semi-final
for the history books, indeed.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.990
Our four singers
sang their tails off tonight,

31:08.033 --> 31:12.411
but only two will advance
to the group a finals.

31:12.454 --> 31:17.040
Audience, panel, and our
super fans across america,

31:17.084 --> 31:20.335
vote now for your favorite.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.672
The top two will advance
to the group a finals
in a few weeks.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.299
So hard.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.885
The bottom two will unmask
and head home

31:27.928 --> 31:31.430
in the trunk of
will.I.Am's suburban.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.515
The votes are in,

31:33.559 --> 31:38.186
and the first singer
headed home tonight is...

31:39.023 --> 31:40.355
I'm so sorry.

31:52.995 --> 31:55.495
- Jester.
- Oh, man.

31:55.539 --> 31:58.749
The rest of you,
you're safe for now.

31:58.792 --> 32:01.293
Show the jester some love
and head back to the lair.

32:01.337 --> 32:06.214
- We love you, jester.
- We'll see you in a minute
for the second unmasking.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.176
- Jester! Jester! Jester!
- We hate to see you leave,

32:09.219 --> 32:13.221
- but we love to get to see
who you truly are.
- Yeah!

32:13.265 --> 32:16.600
But first let's bring
them first impression guesses
out from the vault.

32:21.857 --> 32:25.317
- Oh, I can't wait.
- He already knows ain't
none of us get it.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.236
All right.
Now, panel, remember,

32:28.280 --> 32:31.281
if your first impression guess
is correct, you get a point.

32:31.283 --> 32:35.285
Ken, your first impression guess
was roger daltry.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.412
Are you going
to stick with that one?

32:37.456 --> 32:40.290
Man, I've been all over
the place with jester.

32:40.334 --> 32:44.294
But I think this is
legendary rocker

32:44.296 --> 32:47.214
from the who, roger daltry.

32:47.257 --> 32:51.093
All right.
He's sticking with it.

32:51.136 --> 32:56.264
Nicole, your first impression
guess was sammy hagar.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.475
- I'm not sticking with it.
- Okay.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.268
We saw "cake."

33:00.270 --> 33:03.146
cake makes me
think of sweets,

33:03.190 --> 33:05.065
like hershey's kisses.

33:05.109 --> 33:09.444
I think this could be
gene simmons from kiss.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.989
He has been with his partner
shannon for about 40 years.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.950
Nick: There it is.
All right, robin?

33:14.994 --> 33:16.994
Alice cooper.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.997
Yes, he sang an alice cooper
song and it was spot on.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.457
"school's out."
but I think it might be

33:22.501 --> 33:24.668
one of the red hot
chili peppers, mr. Flea.

33:24.712 --> 33:26.545
- All right.
- Ken: Good guess.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.088
Flea's fun.

33:28.132 --> 33:30.257
Flea is definitely fun.
All right, jenny.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.801
- Yes.
- Dee snyder.

33:32.803 --> 33:37.389
Well, y'know, he did
give us a twisted clue
when he was onstage.

33:37.433 --> 33:39.474
He has been married
for 40 years.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.227
- Mm.
- I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

33:42.271 --> 33:45.147
I need to know.
This is dee snyder!

33:45.190 --> 33:47.024
- There you go, jenny.
- Not bad.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.276
Will.I.Am, who is this?

33:49.319 --> 33:52.404
Joe elliot,
lead singer of def leppard.

33:52.448 --> 33:53.405
Yeah.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.992
Been married to his wife
for a real long time.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.369
- Come on, will!
- Yes!

33:59.413 --> 34:01.329
All right. These guys
made their final guesses.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.249
Let's see if any of you
are even close.

34:04.293 --> 34:07.836
Jester, we need to know
who you are.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.754
Audience, say it with me.

34:09.006 --> 34:12.924

34:38.619 --> 34:40.327

- Ken: Wow.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.163
Lead singer of the sex pistols!

34:43.207 --> 34:45.957
Johnny rotten in the building!

34:46.001 --> 34:49.419
- Johnny rotten?
- Wow.

34:49.463 --> 34:54.549
- A legend. Punk legend.
- Literally the inventor
of punk rock.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.593
Johnny freaking rotten?

34:56.637 --> 34:58.053
Nick: Johnny rotten
right here, will.I.Am.

34:58.097 --> 35:01.431
Wow! You know, it's very rare,

35:01.433 --> 35:05.227
like, you meet people
that have inspired generations,

35:05.270 --> 35:08.980
that gave liberty to people
to express themselves and rebel.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.024
You mean so much
to the world of music,

35:11.068 --> 35:14.277
and I just want
to thank you for all that
you've done for music.

35:14.321 --> 35:17.280
- Aww, thank you, will.
- Well said, well said.

35:17.324 --> 35:18.949
Johnny:
We've only got one life,

35:18.992 --> 35:21.409
and we must explore
all the possibilities,

35:21.411 --> 35:24.663
and be limited by no one
for no reason.

35:24.665 --> 35:28.041
True punk rock, baby.

35:28.085 --> 35:30.252
I need to know about the cake.
That's driving me crazy.

35:30.295 --> 35:33.713
Ah, in britain, we were banned
everywhere, couldn't play.

35:33.757 --> 35:37.342
And so we managed to get
this gig playing for orphans,

35:37.386 --> 35:40.387
and they had cake
and they smothered us in it.

35:40.430 --> 35:45.225
So children got us,
but adults didn't.

35:45.269 --> 35:47.477
- Ah!
- I love that.

35:47.521 --> 35:50.313
Now, when we saw you
talk about your wife

35:50.357 --> 35:51.523
and that you're
doing this for her,

35:51.567 --> 35:53.608
please can you expound
on that a little?

35:53.610 --> 35:55.152
We've been married 45 years.

35:55.195 --> 35:58.947
- Wow.
- That's success.

35:58.991 --> 36:02.242
And, uh, no sadness,
you know,

36:02.286 --> 36:04.452
but she's at a certain
point now in her life

36:04.496 --> 36:07.289
where she's suffering
from alzheimer's.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.374
And it's my job
as her main protector

36:09.418 --> 36:11.918
and love of my life
to look after her,

36:11.962 --> 36:15.297
and she will love this.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.299
- Bless you.
- That's what this show
is all about.

36:17.342 --> 36:21.386
Thank you so much
for joining us.
Johnny rotten, y'all.

36:21.430 --> 36:23.722
Y'all gotta make some noise
for the legend.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.056
It was a pleasure having you.

36:25.100 --> 36:29.978
And to sing
one last time unmasked,

36:30.022 --> 36:33.356
the artist formerly known

- Jester was just unmasked,

37:09.311 --> 37:13.897
so who is joining him
in a very awkward
ride home tonight?

37:13.941 --> 37:15.190
It's time to find out.

37:15.192 --> 37:20.195

unmasking is...

37:44.930 --> 37:47.514
Keep it going.

37:47.557 --> 37:50.433
That means bull and skunk
will be battling it out

37:50.477 --> 37:55.313
for the title of group a
champion in two weeks.

37:55.357 --> 37:57.983
I don't like this!
Pepper, we love you.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.693
Y'all keep it going for pepper.

37:59.736 --> 38:02.320
Robin: Pepper! Pepper!

38:02.322 --> 38:04.531
That was probably
the hardest vote you guys
ever had to do.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.157
- Ever.
- Yes.
- All amazing voices.

38:06.201 --> 38:10.036
Pepper, I'm so sorry
that you are leaving us.

38:10.038 --> 38:13.290
But we are so happy
we get to see who you are.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.250
- But before we get to that...
- No.

38:15.294 --> 38:19.087
...It's time for your
first impression guesses.

38:19.131 --> 38:22.090
Men in black, bring them out.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.600
- All right.
- Uh-oh.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.394
Mr. Robin thicke,
your first impression guess

38:34.438 --> 38:39.190
for pepper
was carly rae jepson.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.818
Okay. A new name came to mind
when she was singing.

38:41.862 --> 38:45.530
She definitely
had the good girl image,
was known for that.

38:45.532 --> 38:48.116
I think this is the lovely,
talented mandy moore.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.118
- All right. Good guess.
- Wow.

38:50.162 --> 38:54.497
- That's a great guess,
but mine is better.
- Always.

38:54.541 --> 38:59.252
All right, jenny,
you chose lana del rey.

38:59.296 --> 39:00.670
Are you sticking with it?

39:00.714 --> 39:03.256
No, I'm not, nick.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.301
Well, this artist,
she's definitely a songwriter,

39:06.345 --> 39:11.181
knows how to tell a story,
and, ken, she toured with train.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.391
- ( gasps )
- ooh.

39:13.435 --> 39:17.687
I think this is the beautiful,
wonderful dido.

39:17.731 --> 39:18.980
Ooh, wow.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.523
- Not a bad guess at all.
- Good guess.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.609
Thanks, right? Thanks, guys.
Thank you very much.

39:22.652 --> 39:27.489
- Ken, your first impression
guess was kesha.
- Ken: Oh!

39:27.532 --> 39:29.783
- Okay. I like that guess.
- What were you thinking?

39:29.826 --> 39:32.410
- No, that's pretty good.
- You sticking with it?

39:32.454 --> 39:35.121
Still not happy about
the sarah bareilles situation.

39:35.165 --> 39:37.165
But if it's truly not her,

39:37.209 --> 39:41.586
I'm gonna steal jenny's guess
from weeks ago.

39:41.630 --> 39:44.506
I think pepper is pink.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.008
- There you go.
- Oh! I like that.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.052
- Some things never change.
- Boom!

39:49.096 --> 39:53.181
Now, nicole, you chose
natasha beddingfield.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.392
- Ooh.
- Oh, I love that.

39:55.435 --> 39:59.104
- Are you sticking with it?
- I'm sticking with it.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.772
I don't know if y'all remember,

40:00.816 --> 40:02.899
there was a hollywood sign
in the clue package, too.

40:02.943 --> 40:06.486
'cause "unwritten" was, uh,
you know, on "the hills."

40:06.488 --> 40:10.031
- oh.
- That's gotta be my girl
natasha beddingfield.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.491
- All right.
- All right.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.451
I'm a huge fan
of natasha beddingfield.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.911
She's quite confident.

40:14.913 --> 40:19.290
Our superstar guest panelist,
will.I.Am, who is the pepper?

40:19.292 --> 40:21.167
I'm just going off
of my favorite singer...

40:21.211 --> 40:23.461
- Uh-huh.
- ...Coupled with
the tone of voice.

40:23.463 --> 40:25.422
So I'm thinking maybe it's sia.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.966
- Jenny: Ooh!
- Nicole: I love sia.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.384
- Robin: Great guess.
- Me, too.

40:29.428 --> 40:32.053
Okay, panel, you made
your final guesses.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.639
Let's see if any of you
are correct.

- Scherzie's on the board.

41:18.268 --> 41:23.980
Amazing job. Amazing vocals.
Amazing performance.

41:24.024 --> 41:25.523
Tell me about being pepper.

41:25.567 --> 41:29.444
Well, um, you know,
it's fun to be spicy.

41:29.488 --> 41:31.237
- Hey!
- Yes!

41:31.281 --> 41:33.031
Your performances
were crushing it.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.407
- Like, jaw-dropping.
- Outstanding.

41:34.451 --> 41:37.327
Thank you.
I just want people
to feel something.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.120
And so I'm really trying
to tell a story,

41:39.164 --> 41:40.288
- and that's what I'm hoping--
- jenny: I felt it.

41:40.332 --> 41:41.998
- Thank you.
- Felt it.

41:42.042 --> 41:44.667
- Terrific writer, too.
- Thank you.

41:46.338 --> 41:49.339
Natasha, you talked about
someone you were close to
in your package.

41:49.382 --> 41:52.425
- You-- who was that?
- Oh, my son,

41:52.427 --> 41:55.345
he had brain surgery
just before the pandemic.

41:55.388 --> 41:59.182
He's three.
We were, like, five weeks
in the hospital.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.643
You go through something
like that and you see, like,

42:01.686 --> 42:04.062
just how many
strong people there are,

42:04.105 --> 42:06.064
and it makes you stop
caring about things

42:06.107 --> 42:07.190
that you used to care about.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.317
- That's so true.
- How's he doing?

42:09.319 --> 42:11.903
He's so incredible. Perfect.

42:11.947 --> 42:14.405
- I'm so glad!
- Yeah, he's great.

42:14.407 --> 42:17.408
- And his favorite color is red!
- There it is.

42:17.452 --> 42:20.453
- Oh, yes.
- He's going to see mom
as the pepper.

42:20.497 --> 42:23.414
- Truly a blessing.
- We love you.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.083
I mean, all of you guys,
I'm just so--

42:25.126 --> 42:28.086
seriously, I'm so honored,
and thank you for having me.

42:28.129 --> 42:29.879
- Thank you.
- With one point
correct for pepper,

42:29.881 --> 42:34.050

in first impression guesses.

42:34.094 --> 42:35.760
- Yes.
- And right now,
