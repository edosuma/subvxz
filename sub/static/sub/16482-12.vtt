He's going to put us in his prayers.

11:48.906 --> 11:51.506
Well, that should do it.

11:52.543 --> 11:54.676
What have I done now, Samantha?

11:54.678 --> 11:56.578
(quietly) Nothing.

11:58.982 --> 12:02.317
You know what I asked him to
help me with? Father Williams?

12:04.388 --> 12:06.555
I asked him to save my marriage.

12:09.193 --> 12:11.793

12:11.795 --> 12:13.395

12:25.175 --> 12:27.008
So, what are we doing here again?

12:27.010 --> 12:28.343
'Cause it's your birthday.

12:28.345 --> 12:31.146
And my gift to you is
this... showing you the way.

12:32.116 --> 12:33.882
- Golf?
- Golf.

12:33.884 --> 12:37.652
Nah, man, it's... it's
not my thing, pal.

12:37.654 --> 12:39.505
Last I checked it's
not your thing, but...

12:39.506 --> 12:40.598
What?

12:40.599 --> 12:42.165
I'm just... I want to get back to Bec.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.099
- What? No, no, no.
- I'm-I'm gonna take off...

12:44.127 --> 12:45.727

get you some new clubs.

12:50.801 --> 12:52.567
No, look, I-I don't
want to spend the money.

12:52.569 --> 12:55.737
Wrong. Being a father means
that every once in a while

12:55.739 --> 12:57.506

Oh, Jack, come on, now, I...

16:50.396 --> 16:52.763
I love you, and I'm excited for you.

16:52.765 --> 16:55.100
You are a superhero. But don't
kid yourself... triplets are

16:55.102 --> 16:56.668

No, look, you're not buying anything.

- You're gonna love golf, Jack.

17:20.558 --> 17:22.191

his birthday. Do you understand me?

19:21.245 --> 19:22.811
I need to make him something homemade.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.079
It doesn't have to be fancy

19:24.181 --> 19:26.148
chocolate almond cake. It
just has to be homemade,

with my own two hands

23:27.906 --> 23:30.006
I know I'm getting a
little ahead of myself,

23:30.008 --> 23:33.009
but I can't wait to make
Halloween costumes for you,

23:33.011 --> 23:35.678
which is weird, because I'm
not a big Halloween person.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.680
(giggles softly)

23:46.682 --> 23:49.583
I've been acting out lately.

23:49.585 --> 23:53.453
I've been terrible to
your dad, who is just...

23:53.455 --> 23:55.155
perfect.

23:55.157 --> 23:56.356
He is so perfect.

23:56.358 --> 23:58.091
Oh, my God,

23:58.093 --> 24:00.060
you guys are going to freak out

24:00.062 --> 24:01.995
when you see how awesome your dad is.

24:01.997 --> 24:03.964
Honestly, you're gonna be...

24:03.966 --> 24:05.933
huge fans.

24:16.345 --> 24:20.013
I think I'm nervous about
you guys meeting <i> me.</i>

24:22.585 --> 24:24.918
I don't know how much you
can tell from in there,

24:24.920 --> 24:27.554
but I am not gonna be the perfect mom

24:27.556 --> 24:29.056
you've probably been dreaming about.

24:29.058 --> 24:31.992
You guys dream, right?

24:31.994 --> 24:33.994
I think so.

24:36.699 --> 24:39.299
I'm impatient.

24:39.301 --> 24:41.568
And I'm...

24:41.570 --> 24:43.537
stubborn.

24:43.539 --> 24:45.472
And, uh... (sniffs)

24:45.594 --> 24:47.561
... I stole an Abba-Zaba bar

24:47.563 --> 24:49.429
from the grocery store in fourth grade.

24:49.431 --> 24:52.366
And I'm... terrified

24:52.368 --> 24:54.401
that I'm gonna make a
hundred wrong decisions

24:54.403 --> 24:56.103
and ruin the chances that you guys have

24:56.105 --> 24:59.006
to lead the perfect lives
that you deserve, but...

25:01.944 --> 25:04.878
I will protect you fiercely.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.048
And I will always sing to you

25:08.050 --> 25:10.017
when you can't sleep.

25:12.388 --> 25:14.788
And I will always be
excited to hear you laugh.

25:16.558 --> 25:19.493
I bet you guys are gonna have
wildly different laughs, huh?

25:19.495 --> 25:22.295
(giggles)

25:22.297 --> 25:25.999
I love you so much it hurts,
and I haven't even met you yet.

25:26.001 --> 25:28.001
It's crazy.

25:29.338 --> 25:31.538
Mm.

25:31.540 --> 25:33.874
So, I guess what...

25:33.876 --> 25:36.810
I'm trying to say is, um...

25:36.812 --> 25:40.013
you are gonna have to
take the good with the bad

25:40.015 --> 25:42.182
when it comes to me. (sniffs)

25:42.184 --> 25:44.618
So, now that you know all of this,

25:44.620 --> 25:47.154
are you still...

25:47.156 --> 25:50.991
excited to come and
join me out here, huh?

25:56.799 --> 25:58.765
I'll take that as a yes.

26:01.170 --> 26:03.303
JACK: You are so beautiful.

26:03.305 --> 26:06.173
Jack, what are you doing? (chuckling)

26:06.175 --> 26:08.108
Where did you get that thing?

26:08.110 --> 26:10.377
Eh, I thought that we needed it.

26:10.479 --> 26:12.612
Babe, wait, have you been
filming me this whole time?

26:12.614 --> 26:14.315
- Yeah.
- No.

26:14.317 --> 26:16.149
It's okay, don't worry,
it doesn't-it doesn't

26:16.151 --> 26:17.717
get sound, just picture.

26:17.719 --> 26:19.186
- Turn it off.
- Uh-uh.

26:19.188 --> 26:20.754
(chuckles)

26:20.756 --> 26:22.122
Come here.

26:22.124 --> 26:24.624
Come here, baby.

26:26.695 --> 26:28.929
I forgot your birthday.

26:30.499 --> 26:31.865
- It's okay.
- No,

26:31.867 --> 26:33.033
it's not okay, 'cause you are

26:33.035 --> 26:34.935
the world's greatest husband.

26:34.937 --> 26:37.971
And you're gonna be the
world's greatest dad.

26:37.973 --> 26:39.940
And I promise you,
me and the kids...

26:39.942 --> 26:41.875
We're gonna make you those
cheesy mugs every year

26:41.877 --> 26:43.410
for your birthday.

26:43.412 --> 26:44.544
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:44.546 --> 26:46.580
And I-I...

26:46.582 --> 26:49.082
got you the world's
worst birthday present.

26:49.084 --> 26:51.451
And I made you the world's
worst birthday cupcake

26:51.453 --> 26:53.253
down in the kitchen,
but I don't know...

26:53.255 --> 26:55.122
I had to do something. (laughing)

26:55.124 --> 26:56.756
Oh.

26:56.848 --> 26:58.548
Oh, that is...

26:58.550 --> 27:01.251
- that is exactly what I wanted.
- No, it's not.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.053
Well, there is a certain dance

27:03.055 --> 27:04.688
that I look forward to every year...

27:04.690 --> 27:05.922
- Jack.
- Yeah.

27:05.924 --> 27:08.658
No. Stop. I was...

27:08.660 --> 27:11.194
I was actually thinking like, um,

27:11.196 --> 27:13.196
I don't know, like, a shoulder rub.

27:13.198 --> 27:15.732
- Eh...
- Babe.

27:15.734 --> 27:18.602
None of my lingerie is gonna fit me.

27:18.604 --> 27:20.036
That's okay.

27:20.038 --> 27:22.038
Birthday tradition doesn't care.

27:23.408 --> 27:24.608
Mm-hmm.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.110
Okay.

27:27.112 --> 27:29.212
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah. All right, cowboy.

27:29.214 --> 27:32.849
So, I'll meet you in the
bedroom in five minutes.

27:32.951 --> 27:34.217
- You know what to do.
- Mm-hmm.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.019
Strip down to your birthday suit.

27:36.021 --> 27:37.554
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.522
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

27:39.524 --> 27:41.224
(whispered conversation)

27:49.431 --> 27:51.298
It's my home, Peter.

27:51.371 --> 27:53.939
I'd appreciate if everyone
spoke at full volume.

27:53.941 --> 27:55.307
Now, what's on your mind?

27:55.309 --> 27:58.043
Dad, we're officially worried about you.

27:58.045 --> 28:01.780
Well, that is officially unnecessary.

28:01.782 --> 28:03.248
We miss her, too.

28:03.250 --> 28:05.817
Dad, she's been gone for over a year.

28:05.819 --> 28:07.519
14 months.

28:08.856 --> 28:10.489
Nathan...

28:10.491 --> 28:11.757
you're still a young man.

28:11.759 --> 28:14.259
I mean, you're working, what,

28:14.261 --> 28:15.928
60 hours a week at the hospital?

28:15.930 --> 28:18.330
I wish. That would be a vacation.

28:18.332 --> 28:20.065
Maybe you could take a vacation.

28:20.067 --> 28:22.167
Please stop.

28:22.169 --> 28:23.402
Mom's gone, Dad.

28:23.404 --> 28:25.370
I know she's gone.

28:25.372 --> 28:27.306
You don't think I know she's gone?

28:27.308 --> 28:30.309
I buried her, Peter.

28:30.311 --> 28:33.912
I was married to her for
53 years and I buried her.

28:33.914 --> 28:36.882
I don't need you to tell me she's gone.

28:41.121 --> 28:44.056
And I will never move on,

28:44.058 --> 28:46.024
so stop asking me to.

28:49.163 --> 28:51.163
She's my wife.

28:52.933 --> 28:54.933
She was my life.

28:57.404 --> 28:58.770
And I love you two,

28:58.772 --> 29:00.672
but if you tell me to move on again

29:00.674 --> 29:02.374
you will not be welcome in our home.

Hey.

- Shh, shh.

29:21.547 --> 29:23.047
Sam.

29:23.048 --> 29:26.550
What? I'm in the middle
of reading something.

29:29.345 --> 29:30.978
What is that?

29:30.980 --> 29:34.281
He was left at the
doorstep of the fire house.

29:34.283 --> 29:37.618
The same day I asked Father
Williams for a miracle,

29:37.620 --> 29:39.620
he was literally left at our doorstep.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.692
So...

29:45.828 --> 29:47.861
He was meant for us, Sam.

29:47.863 --> 29:50.197
We couldn't have kids,

29:50.199 --> 29:52.433
and we grew apart because of it.

29:52.435 --> 29:54.068
But now...

29:54.070 --> 29:57.071
Stop. Joe, that is not our baby.

29:57.073 --> 30:00.641
That is just some child...

30:02.011 --> 30:05.212
... who was left by a terrible person

at your fire station.

Sam...

30:09.352 --> 30:13.220

come on, Joe.

30:16.092 --> 30:18.559
A baby is not just gonna fix us.

30:25.501 --> 30:27.334
That is a newborn baby.

30:27.336 --> 30:29.837
You need to get it to a hospital.

30:29.839 --> 30:31.772

35:43.475 --> 35:45.442
(sighs)

35:45.444 --> 35:47.711
We lost one of the babies.

35:49.348 --> 35:52.816
No. No, that's not true.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.252
Yeah.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.556
(voice breaking): No, that's not true.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.592
(crying) That's not true.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.493
That's not true.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.095
It's okay.

36:05.097 --> 36:07.331
- No! No! No! No! No!
- It's okay.

36:07.333 --> 36:10.267
No. No, no, no, you're lying to me.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.202
- Yeah.
- We have three babies.

36:12.204 --> 36:13.804
We have a boy and a girl.

36:13.806 --> 36:15.072
- (crying)
- We do.

36:15.074 --> 36:16.873
It's okay.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.275

(sniffs)

37:38.306 --> 37:42.041
I felt all of them, Jack.

37:45.547 --> 37:48.548
I felt all three kicking.

37:48.550 --> 37:49.982
(sighs)

37:49.984 --> 37:52.385
I know.

37:53.016 --> 37:56.051
I really felt like we
were meant to have three.

Me, too.

What if we still are?

Hey.

38:19.869 --> 38:21.836
Baby okay?

38:21.838 --> 38:23.337
Yeah.

38:28.978 --> 38:31.579
You're a good man.

38:31.581 --> 38:33.581
What?

38:34.717 --> 38:36.884
We've been awful lately.

38:36.886 --> 38:38.452
Um...

38:40.657 --> 38:43.791
And you find an abandoned baby,

38:43.793 --> 38:47.962
and your first thought
is to bring him home.

38:47.964 --> 38:51.399
To try and...

38:51.401 --> 38:55.069
repair us... with him.

38:55.071 --> 38:57.505
- It was stupid.
- Yeah.

38:57.507 --> 39:00.241
But also sweet.

39:01.444 --> 39:05.379
You ever wish we could just start over?

39:05.381 --> 39:09.417
Go back to where we started,

39:09.419 --> 39:12.019
like that first day, you know, just

39:12.021 --> 39:15.890
try to do it all fresh?

39:15.892 --> 39:18.726
Yeah, sometimes. All the time.

39:18.728 --> 39:21.295
It's all I want, honestly...

39:21.297 --> 39:23.731
to start over.

39:24.901 --> 39:26.467
(sighs)

39:30.673 --> 39:34.075
(sighs)

39:39.415 --> 39:43.117
(voice trembling): Hi. I'm Samantha.

39:43.119 --> 39:46.687
Don't... worry about
what happened back there.

39:46.689 --> 39:49.390
Can I take you for a cup of coffee?

39:51.828 --> 39:53.861
Yeah.

39:55.031 --> 39:58.432
Yeah.

40:02.739 --> 40:04.672
God, that was a day.

40:04.674 --> 40:06.741
- You hear the latest?
- What's that?

40:06.743 --> 40:08.809
Couple with the triplets.

40:08.811 --> 40:12.213
He's been asking about the
baby from the fire station.

40:12.215 --> 40:15.650
Might be thinking about adopting.

40:15.652 --> 40:17.918
Hmm.

40:18.888 --> 40:20.955
Well, I'm out of here.

40:20.957 --> 40:22.390
- Night, Dr. Katowski.
- Mm-hmm.

40:38.341 --> 40:40.641
I, um... (sniffles)

40:40.643 --> 40:43.611
... told a young man about
the baby, yesterday, hon.

40:43.613 --> 40:45.579
(sniffles)

40:45.581 --> 40:48.482
I haven't spoken to
anybody about that in...

40:48.484 --> 40:51.218
a really long time.

40:51.220 --> 40:54.588
<i>And I, uh... I gave him some advice.</i>

40:56.592 --> 40:59.093
<i>And it seems he may have
actually listened to me.</i>

41:00.997 --> 41:03.497
<i>It seems he may have
taken the worst thing</i>

41:03.499 --> 41:06.133
<i>that ever happened to him in his life,</i>

41:06.135 --> 41:09.337
<i>and tried to push on.</i>

41:16.946 --> 41:19.347
There isn't a minute that goes by

41:19.349 --> 41:21.649
that I don't think of you.

41:26.556 --> 41:28.489
(voice breaking) And I...

41:28.491 --> 41:30.524
I hope you know this.

41:30.526 --> 41:33.694
I hope this is what
you would want me to do.

41:35.898 --> 41:38.232
(sniffles)

41:39.302 --> 41:42.970
I expect it is.

41:52.419 --> 41:53.887

so we're gonna start at the beginning.

42:05.678 --> 42:06.877

42:06.879 --> 42:07.926
- Secret.

42:07.951 --> 42:09.012

42:09.014 --> 42:10.280
