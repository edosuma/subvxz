00:20.988 --> 00:24.258
- This place seems confused
by the rules of night and day.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.429
Or perhaps it
simply ignores them,

00:28.496 --> 00:31.132
refusing to cool
when the sun fades.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.604
It's as if God
has not yet decided

00:36.670 --> 00:37.971
what this place should become.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.609
Will it be desert?

00:43.977 --> 00:45.279
Will it be prairie?

00:52.786 --> 00:57.291
Every living thing is armed
with thorns and horns and fangs

00:57.358 --> 01:01.695
as the land wages war on
itself, seeking the answer...

01:07.868 --> 01:09.937
I knew that war.

01:10.003 --> 01:13.174
That war between what
you should become,

01:13.241 --> 01:14.842
and what you could become.

01:18.546 --> 01:22.783
I looked at this place
and saw my unfinished soul.

01:25.386 --> 01:29.790
I looked at this
place and knew, for me...

01:29.857 --> 01:31.425
that war was over.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.795
I know what I am now.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.332
I'm a cowboy.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.970
[music]

01:53.113 --> 01:56.184
It seems the farther
we get from civilization,

01:56.250 --> 01:58.552
the more of its rules
we leave behind.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.054
Its traditions.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.324
Its inhibitions...

02:05.293 --> 02:07.495
The farther west we travel,

02:07.561 --> 02:11.098
the more those rules
and customs become a burden.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.357
[music]

02:51.539 --> 02:55.709
[panting]

02:55.776 --> 02:57.311
- You speak English?

02:57.378 --> 03:01.081
- Sorry. No English.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.016
Alina.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.652
[speaks Italian]

03:06.687 --> 03:08.389
Wife English.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.758
- Oh, um...

03:10.824 --> 03:12.460
- What do you call those?

03:14.328 --> 03:15.263
- Pants.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.698
- In his language.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.933
- Pantaloni.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.369
- Ask him if he has more.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.405
- I know he has more
because I made them.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.874
- Can I trade for some?
- Trade.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.542
- I give you
something and you give--

03:28.609 --> 03:31.111
- I know what trade is.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.247
Why you want my husband's pants?

03:33.314 --> 03:35.416
- Tired of blisters
from the saddle.

03:35.483 --> 03:38.118
- Let's talk trade.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.187
- What do you want?
- What do you have?

03:40.254 --> 03:42.990
- What do you need?
- We need everything.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.901
- It's gold.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.936
- What good is gold
to me out here?

03:56.003 --> 03:59.607
- If everything is what
you need, gold can buy it.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.976
- Oh. I just walk over
to store then.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.478
- There's stores in Abilene.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.619
- Why you have gold?

04:11.685 --> 04:13.053
- Why I have it is none
of your business.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.122
- Then you stole it
and we have no trade.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.558
- Wait.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.560
My father made jewelry
of his money to hide it.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.395
He hid some on me.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.065
- Not yours to hide anymore.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.868
I get you pants.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.373
[chuckles]

04:35.643 --> 04:38.211
There is pants.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.381
Should fit you.
Too small for him.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.015
You have skinny hips.

04:42.082 --> 04:45.753
- You think so?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.555
- I know.
I looking at you.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.189
When you have baby,
its head coming out

04:49.256 --> 04:50.558
looking like eggplant.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.960
- What's eggplant?

05:01.802 --> 05:02.970
[chuckles]

05:09.276 --> 05:10.444
Can you do that to my dress?

05:14.582 --> 05:16.717
[music]

05:19.286 --> 05:21.221
[kissing noises]

05:30.764 --> 05:33.166
What's the matter, never seen
a woman in pants before?

05:33.233 --> 05:36.370
- Naw, I think you're the first.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.239
Hey, cut it out.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.611
[clicks tongue]

05:47.080 --> 05:48.582
- Oh...

05:52.620 --> 05:53.754
[laughs]

05:53.821 --> 05:55.589
It's not the worst
idea you've had.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.629
I don't want to know
where the pants came from.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.264
- I traded for them--
- I said I don't want to know.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.735
[sigh]

06:07.801 --> 06:09.570
Traded what?

06:09.637 --> 06:10.738
Never mind.
I don't want to know.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.305
[clicks tongue]
- [chuckles]

06:21.582 --> 06:23.584
- What time's the meeting?
- Now.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.085
- You want me to come?

06:25.152 --> 06:28.422
- No, stay with the herd.
I saw wolf tracks by the river.

06:35.463 --> 06:36.864
That one of them gypsies?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.165
- Sorta.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.100
- I'll bring you supper.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.435
- Hey, bring me two.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.510
[music]

07:53.040 --> 07:54.775
[music]

08:10.290 --> 08:12.626
- River looked
pretty deep to me.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.061
- It's high.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.163
- Maybe we should've crossed
the Red where we was.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.031
Now we're crossing two rivers...

08:18.098 --> 08:20.568
- We're gonna cross twenty
before we're done.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.736
- I didn't see
a decent place to cross here.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.805
- There's one a few miles up.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.474
There's a spot wild cattle use.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.442
Ground pretty rocky.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.978
- How deep?

08:31.044 --> 08:33.547
- It's a swim.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.515
- Your people know how to swim?

08:35.583 --> 08:37.651
- It's illegal
where we are from.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.087
- To swim?

08:40.153 --> 08:41.922
- Where I am from they whip
the bodies of the drowned

08:41.989 --> 08:43.256
before they are buried.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.458
For getting in a river
in the first place.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.827
We don't swim.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.765
- We could get the cattle
across first

08:51.832 --> 08:54.802
then get as many over horseback
as we can,

08:54.868 --> 08:56.837
then the wagons.

09:00.007 --> 09:03.811
- Look, my two cents?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.512
If we run the cattle
over first

09:05.579 --> 09:08.081
they're gonna make
soup out of the bank.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.382
You get a wagon
stuck and you've got

09:09.449 --> 09:11.218
a traffic jam in
the middle of the river.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.955
I seen it,
and you don't want to.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.257
Ferry folks over
then send the wagons.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.558
Then bring the herd.

09:18.626 --> 09:21.561
- How many folks you
need to hold the herd?

09:21.629 --> 09:23.731
- Don't worry about the herd,
I'll get the herd across,

09:23.797 --> 09:25.633
you just keep those
wagons off the bank

09:25.699 --> 09:26.967
or I'm gonna have
a traffic jam too.

09:29.670 --> 09:33.240
- Can you help us
ferry folks across?

09:33.306 --> 09:34.507
- I can do that.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.710
- That means
your wife has to drive a wagon.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.713
- My wife could back a wagon
through the doors of a saloon.

09:39.780 --> 09:40.781
She'll be fine.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.118
- We'll cross in the morning.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.054
- Wait till it warms up.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.723
Let everything get hot
and a little tired.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.225
Animals will be more ready
to get in the river then.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.394
- That's rain over there.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.229
Rain over there
is a higher river here.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.731
- It's high already.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.303
- By the time I get
these misfits moving

10:03.370 --> 10:04.938
it'll be midday, farmer.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.339
Don't you worry about it.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.777
- I ain't no fucking farmer.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.112
- You were.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.514
- I was a captain, too.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.416
I don't call myself
that either...

10:21.755 --> 10:22.990
Captain.

10:29.797 --> 10:30.964
[clears throat]

10:32.532 --> 10:35.268
- Steal some hard tack,
if you don't mind.

10:35.335 --> 10:39.106
- There's some biscuits
in my teepee and some bacon.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.508
- How old's the biscuits?

10:41.574 --> 10:43.076
- They're new enough.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.218
- Thought we was
getting a cook.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.087
- Abilene.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.255
- How bout we kill one
of them beefs

10:55.322 --> 10:57.390
when we get across the river?

10:57.457 --> 11:00.460
- We'll kill a beef when we
have a cook to butcher it.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.830
- This ain't the part of
the trip where we skinny up.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.998
This is the part
where we get fat.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.767
The skinny part's coming.

11:06.834 --> 11:11.638
- We butcher it ourselves,
we'll waste most of it.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.841
Run through
that herd in a month.

11:13.907 --> 11:18.311
Then we ain't skinnying up,
we're starving.

11:18.378 --> 11:23.116
- Hm. Well, have a look
around, Captain.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.887
We're starving already.
[clicks tongue]

11:29.923 --> 11:32.225
- This talking back
is getting contagious.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.595
- You need to have a word
with that farmer.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.565
A word that sticks.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.703
Let me do it,
I'll make sure it sticks.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.108
- By the time we get
to the territories,

11:48.175 --> 11:50.443
we're gonna need all
the fight he's got in him.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.053
They whip the bodies
because it's illegal to swim.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.156
- Illegal to do everything.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.524
Except pay taxes.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.799
[sighs]

12:14.167 --> 12:16.937
Uh... Oregon.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.273
You've seen it?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.474
- I've seen it.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.577
- What was it like?

12:24.644 --> 12:27.314
- It's worth the risk
if that's what you're asking.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.617
- That's what I'm asking.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.322
[music]

12:41.829 --> 12:43.663
- Once we cross the Brazos...

12:43.730 --> 12:45.298
- No turning back.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.466
- Nope.

12:50.670 --> 12:54.274
- It takes a lot
to surprise me, Thomas.

12:54.341 --> 12:58.645
These people, they've never been
allowed to think for themselves.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.214
Now they can hardly
think at all.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.151
The fact they ain't headed
for Galveston

13:04.217 --> 13:07.287
and begging their way on
a boat for home shocks me.

13:08.788 --> 13:12.192
It shocks me, Thomas.

13:12.259 --> 13:15.062
That they haven't quit yet.

13:15.128 --> 13:19.232
- Don't know why
them folks wanna go home.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.334
Their home sounds like hell.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.037
- 'Cause it's the
hell they know.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.907
Most terrifying thing on
this planet is the unknown.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.212
- That's 'cause you ain't never
been whipped, Captain.

13:37.117 --> 13:40.287
Let someone put
a whip to your back

13:40.353 --> 13:42.990
and tell me the unknown
is what scares you.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.561
These folks ain't
never going home.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.964
[music]

14:04.244 --> 14:06.213
[music]

14:33.206 --> 14:35.342
[insects]

15:39.239 --> 15:40.473
- Hey...

15:41.975 --> 15:44.344
We'll have to break camp
and cross the river tonight.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.382
- Why tonight?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.651
- It ain't safe
to be behind them.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.988
- You think crossing alone
the river at night is safer?

15:55.055 --> 15:57.057
- These folks are gonna
need help,

15:57.124 --> 15:58.125
we can't help if
we're one of them.

16:00.760 --> 16:01.894
- What about Elsa?

16:04.264 --> 16:05.365
- I'll get her.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.703
- [deep breath]

16:10.770 --> 16:12.039
I'll hook the team.

16:22.982 --> 16:27.520
- * Beautiful dreamer *

16:27.587 --> 16:31.658
* Wake unto me *

16:31.724 --> 16:38.231
* Starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee *

16:38.298 --> 16:43.170
* Sounds of the rude world *

16:43.236 --> 16:46.973
* Heard in the day *

16:47.040 --> 16:48.575
* Lull'd by the moonli-- *

16:48.641 --> 16:49.776
[rustling]

16:52.479 --> 16:53.546
- Don't stop.

16:59.786 --> 17:04.724
- * Sta-- *
I can't--I can't.

17:04.791 --> 17:05.892
- Why not?

17:07.427 --> 17:09.396
- I'm shy.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.864
- Since when were you shy?

17:11.931 --> 17:14.367
- Well, with singing I'm shy.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.737
I just...

17:19.106 --> 17:20.940
Worry it won't sound good.

17:21.007 --> 17:23.042
- Cow don't care how it sounds.

17:23.110 --> 17:27.280
Hell, I sing to them all night,
and I ain't shy about it.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.981
- You probably should be.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.118
- [snorts]
[laughs]

17:31.184 --> 17:35.021
Well, you sure ain't shy
about hard timing me.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.290
- No, that comes
pretty easy to me.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.696
- Well...

17:43.763 --> 17:45.232
Somebody gotta sing to 'em.

17:56.143 --> 17:59.379
- * Beautiful dreamer *

17:59.446 --> 18:03.516
* Wake unto me *

18:03.583 --> 18:10.223
* Starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee *

18:10.290 --> 18:14.127
* Sounds of the rude world *

18:14.194 --> 18:19.332
* Heard in the day *

18:19.399 --> 18:22.369
* Lull'd by the moon... *

18:34.681 --> 18:36.549
- Guess I'm the
one being forward now.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.252
I'm sorry, I probably should --

18:39.319 --> 18:40.820
- Do it again.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.957
[music]

19:31.704 --> 19:33.340
- You gonna shoot me?

19:33.406 --> 19:34.774
- Thinking about it.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.911
We're moving the wagon
across the river.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.280
- When?

19:40.347 --> 19:42.715
- Now.

19:42.782 --> 19:46.152
- I should stay with the herd.
It takes three to move it.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.721
- Herd ain't going nowhere
with you two swapping supper.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.792
You got a job to do.
Y'all do it.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.927
- Yessir.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.065
Daddy.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.013
You mad?

20:16.983 --> 20:18.251
- You like him?

20:22.355 --> 20:23.823
- I do.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.794
- Then why would I be mad?

20:31.998 --> 20:34.233
I can't treat you
like an adult when it suits me

20:34.301 --> 20:36.068
and a child when I'm worried.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.272
You're one or the other.

20:41.641 --> 20:46.679
Your mother is gonna be
a different story.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.247
- You gonna tell her?

20:48.315 --> 20:51.284
- Hell, no.
I ain't gonna tell her.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.919
You're gonna tell her.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.290
[music]

20:57.357 --> 20:59.992
Y'all hold the herd till every
wagon is across that river.

21:01.794 --> 21:02.795
- Yessir.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.435
[sighs]

21:09.669 --> 21:10.837
[clicks tongue]

21:13.740 --> 21:15.675
- He ain't gonna shoot me?

21:15.742 --> 21:17.677
- No, he said I could shoot you.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.479
If you act up.

21:21.814 --> 21:25.318
- Well, acting up
is my only skill.

21:26.586 --> 21:27.587
- No, it ain't.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.391
Do it again.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.195
-[laughs]
-Come here.

22:45.264 --> 22:48.100
- Oh, no, don't go wasting
your supplies on me, ma'am.

22:48.167 --> 22:52.204
You just...
just keep them children fed.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.941
You fed, too.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.812
- I would have no supplies
if it weren't for you.

23:27.507 --> 23:28.575
- What're you doing?

23:29.909 --> 23:31.110
- Watching.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.411
- Don't do that.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.114
- Why not?

23:42.421 --> 23:44.056
- Marrying a black
man ain't gonna

23:44.123 --> 23:45.558
solve your problems, ma'am.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.562
It's gonna create
a whole bunch of new ones.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.198
- This is free country.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.135
- There's degrees
of free, ma'am.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.638
- What does that mean?

23:58.705 --> 24:00.940
Government can tell me
who to love?

24:01.007 --> 24:04.544
- Your government
says you can't swim.

24:04.611 --> 24:07.647
Can't protect yourself.

24:07.714 --> 24:10.650
Damn right government
can tell you who to love.

24:10.717 --> 24:12.118
And how to love 'em.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.254
They shouldn't.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.390
But they can.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.699
- Then we go
somewhere they can't.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.267
[chuckles]

24:31.804 --> 24:34.273
- Ma'am, you don't want
nuthin' to do with me.

24:37.844 --> 24:38.945
I'm too old.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.982
Too set in my ways.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.385
I don't like talking.

24:46.452 --> 24:50.456
I like sleeping outside
and I like bathing in a river.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.024
That ain't what a woman wants.

24:53.526 --> 24:56.095
- Men have no idea
what women want.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.098
- [chuckles]
Can't argue that.

25:02.935 --> 25:03.936
- Know why?

25:06.739 --> 25:08.307
Because they never ask.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.679
- What do you want?

25:14.480 --> 25:16.182
- I want to watch you eat.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.552

Okay.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.457
- I don't know.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.528
- Oregon is not like this?

26:06.465 --> 26:09.101
- Oregon is...

26:09.168 --> 26:10.269
mountains...

26:11.838 --> 26:15.141
and green grass to your hips...

26:16.709 --> 26:18.444
all the way to the ocean.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.781
Where you walk ankle
deep in water.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.555
Oregon is paradise.

26:32.358 --> 26:33.626
- I hope so.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.099
- I promise.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.873
- And then a family?

26:47.874 --> 26:49.942
- And then we make a family.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.211
- Then we have a family.

26:59.518 --> 27:00.853
We start making it tonight.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.550
You take John with you.
- Yes, ma'am.

- Come on, son.

28:18.931 --> 28:22.234
There ain't nothing
on this wagon worth dying for.

28:22.301 --> 28:25.104
If it goes under,
you get clear of these horses.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.339
Let all this mess
go down river.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.541
You swim upriver,
I'll come get you.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.911
- Yep.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.245
- Nervous?

28:33.312 --> 28:34.747
- I'm fine.

28:34.814 --> 28:35.982
- I love you.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.118
- Why'd you say that?

28:39.185 --> 28:40.286
- Because I want you to know it.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.754
- Now I'm nervous.

Close your eyes, son.

Cover his ears.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.583
This is harder than you
said it would be.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.753
- I told you it was gonna take
everything we had and then some.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.356

what "everything" meant.

That's why
I don't like to sleep.

I seen it.

You sleep like a goddam baby.

Wasn't scared of no nightmare.

Hell, we went to sleep

- Morning, Captain.

33:01.113 --> 33:05.851
[music]

34:14.353 --> 34:17.156
- What happened
to "Wait till it warms?"

34:17.223 --> 34:18.724
- I didn't mean me.

34:20.392 --> 34:23.262
More current than it looks and
a deep channel in the middle.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.731
Heavy wagons will
get bogged.

34:26.765 --> 34:28.900
- Well...
If they can't cross here

34:28.967 --> 34:31.370
they got no business
going any farther.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.239
- They got no business
going this far.

- One could argue
none of us do.

Guess I'll bring 'em.

I'll help.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.274
solely on the present.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.145
Terror is one.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.246
Grief another.

35:15.481 --> 35:18.083
But nothing washes
the world away

35:18.150 --> 35:19.685
like the lips of another.

35:22.288 --> 35:24.055
Seems an odd custom,

35:24.122 --> 35:26.692
strangers putting
their mouths together

35:26.758 --> 35:29.961
and exploring each other
with their tongues.

35:30.028 --> 35:33.732
When you think about it,
kissing makes no sense at all.

- Mm. That it is...

You hold the right, all right?
- Okay.

36:25.584 --> 36:26.818
[clicks tongue]
- Come on.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.654
Come on, we're going to
push it to the water.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.389
Come on, cows.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.626
- What a silly thing, kissing.

36:36.762 --> 36:39.865
What a pointless,
purposeless thing.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.036
And I couldn't wait
for another.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.944
- River rose overnight.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.447
- How much?

36:55.514 --> 36:56.648
- Enough.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.350
We need to lighten these wagons.

36:58.417 --> 37:01.853
If it ain't absolutely necessary
it doesn't make the trip.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.789

37:10.562 --> 37:11.863
- Can we come back for
the things we leave?

37:11.930 --> 37:13.499
- How we gonna do that?

37:13.565 --> 37:16.935
If it's too heavy,
here's where it stays. Let's go.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.904
[speaking German]

37:18.970 --> 37:21.006
- We will get to Oregon
with nothing.

How do we make our
lives with nothing?!

this around on dry ground.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.678
It's too heavy.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.918
- Get all this shit
out of there.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.556
- Unpack your wagon.

38:16.362 --> 38:18.196
- Goddammit.

38:18.263 --> 38:19.798
Look at this.

38:21.700 --> 38:25.103
What did I tell
you in Fort Worth?

38:25.170 --> 38:28.139
I said if it is
not absolutely necessary

38:28.206 --> 38:29.875
it does not make the trip.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.578
- It is necessary.
He's a musician.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.313
- No, he's not a musician!

38:35.381 --> 38:36.982
And you're not a carpenter,

38:37.048 --> 38:39.184
and he's not a
fucking blacksmith.

38:39.250 --> 38:43.655
You are pioneers, and that's all
you are until you get there.

38:43.722 --> 38:46.992
You have no home, no job,
no farm.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.561
You have the journey,
that's it.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.550
- What's he sayin'?

39:11.617 --> 39:14.285
- He says these things,
they can't be replaced.

39:14.352 --> 39:18.023
You are sending him to Oregon
to be a beggar on the streets.

39:18.089 --> 39:22.694
- These are his choices:
he unloads his wagon.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.463
He goes back to Fort Worth,

39:24.530 --> 39:27.433
or I burn his wagon
to the ground. Tell him.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.695

be alive to do it.

41:54.412 --> 41:55.747
We go across that?

41:55.814 --> 41:58.483
- Yes. We go across it.

43:56.134 --> 43:57.468
- Starts right here.

43:59.604 --> 44:01.740
- You gotta stay
to the right of that spot.

44:01.807 --> 44:05.210
- I know it, Captain.
I passed the word.

44:05.276 --> 44:08.013
Just hope these folks
stay patient.

44:08.079 --> 44:10.315
Cool heads cross rivers.

44:10.381 --> 44:12.017
Hot heads drown.

44:17.756 --> 44:19.157
- Gonna pull wagons.

44:19.224 --> 44:20.792
If someone falls off,

44:20.859 --> 44:23.628
toss them a rope and
pull 'em to the bank.

44:23.695 --> 44:25.430
- Don't let them
reach your horse.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.332
They'll drag you off.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.067
- Why would they drag me off?

44:29.134 --> 44:32.470
- 'Cause when people panic
that's what they do.

44:32.537 --> 44:36.107
- If you come out of the saddle,
that dress'll drown you.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.276
- Oh my God.

44:38.343 --> 44:40.879
I guess we're gonna
get to know each other

44:40.946 --> 44:43.614
a lot better after this day.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.416
[music]

45:08.506 --> 45:11.509
- Looks like they came to their
senses and lightened up.

45:11.576 --> 45:13.344
- A river'll do that to ya.

45:14.846 --> 45:17.749
- Strange they'd just leave it.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.250
- Should've left it in town.

45:20.852 --> 45:22.120
- Once we get to Kansas...

45:22.187 --> 45:23.388
Hell, it looks like a junk yard,

45:23.454 --> 45:25.323
all the things folks
dump at the river bank.

45:25.390 --> 45:27.125
Ovens, bath tubs,

45:27.192 --> 45:29.694
wind mill blades as big
as the wagon it was in.

45:31.096 --> 45:35.033
I swear, folks must think
the way west was paved.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.886
[plunking notes]

45:58.056 --> 46:00.658
- You play?

46:00.725 --> 46:01.726
- I do.

46:04.362 --> 46:06.064
I did.

46:07.065 --> 46:08.299
I guess I don't play anymore.

46:09.935 --> 46:12.904
- Well...
You can play once more.

46:25.150 --> 46:26.484
[plays piano]

46:33.491 --> 46:36.227
[plays "Moonlight Sonata"
by Beethoven]

47:06.191 --> 47:11.196
["Moonlight Sonata" continues]

47:46.464 --> 47:49.434
["Moonlight Sonata" continues]

48:37.015 --> 48:39.550
["Moonlight Sonata" continues]

49:07.812 --> 49:10.248
["Moonlight Sonata" continues]

49:42.647 --> 49:44.815
[crying]

50:16.947 --> 50:18.883
["Moonlight Sonata" continues]

50:31.162 --> 50:33.064
[sobbing]

51:01.359 --> 51:03.328
[panting]

51:10.034 --> 51:11.402
- Don't know any happy ones?

51:11.469 --> 51:13.003
[laughs]

51:21.479 --> 51:23.414
[sniffs]

51:23.481 --> 51:26.151
- Never had much interest
in the happy ones.

51:29.187 --> 51:31.389
[music]

51:40.365 --> 51:41.499
[men shouting]

51:41.566 --> 51:44.502
- Hey, cow.
Hey, cow.

51:44.569 --> 51:48.373
- Get up.
- Yee-hoo!

51:48.439 --> 51:50.040
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.042
[whistling]

51:52.109 --> 51:55.546
- Get up, cow, get up.
Come on. Come on.

51:58.583 --> 51:59.517
Come on! Hey!

51:59.584 --> 52:00.551
- Hut, hut!
- Woop!

52:00.618 --> 52:01.586
- Get up, cow.

52:01.652 --> 52:04.121
[shouting, whooping]

52:04.189 --> 52:07.192
Hey, cow!

52:58.643 --> 53:01.812
- I had abandoned every
memory of Tennessee,

53:01.879 --> 53:04.382
as though I was born
on this journey.

53:04.449 --> 53:05.950
But I wasn't...

53:08.586 --> 53:12.257
We were leaving a place
and seeking another.

53:12.323 --> 53:15.226
And the journey was
the necessary,

53:15.293 --> 53:17.395
miserable road
between the two.

53:22.933 --> 53:25.770
Somehow I felt immune to
the dangers of this place.

53:27.071 --> 53:28.973
As if the land and
I had struck a deal.

53:30.975 --> 53:34.211
I could pass unharmed
so long as I loved it.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.348
And I did.

53:37.415 --> 53:39.484
I loved everything about it.

53:42.553 --> 53:45.923
But crossing the Brazos
taught me there was no deal.

53:47.692 --> 53:51.262
No matter how much we love it,

53:51.329 --> 53:54.765
the land will
never love us back.

53:55.933 --> 53:57.568
