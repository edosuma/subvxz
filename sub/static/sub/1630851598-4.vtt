WEBVTT

00:10.294 --> 00:12.839
- Do you know what frog
is in German?

00:12.914 --> 00:14.712
- I don't.
- Frosch

00:14.787 --> 00:17.079
- Say it again.
- Frosch.

00:17.587 --> 00:18.885
- So if the show went

00:18.961 --> 00:22.359
international, this show
would be called Froscher.

00:22.994 --> 00:25.999
- You like saying that?
- Frosch.

00:26.074 --> 00:27.519
Froscher.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.399
(video game digitizing)

00:29.747 --> 00:30.832
- The best video game

00:30.907 --> 00:34.352
of the 80's has busted
out of the arcade.

00:34.361 --> 00:36.399
Welcome to Frogger.

00:37.521 --> 00:38.639
- Woah.

00:38.987 --> 00:42.392
In. Real. Life.

00:42.467 --> 00:43.592
- Boom.
- And sometimes.

00:43.667 --> 00:44.899
- Look out!

00:44.974 --> 00:48.712
- Life hurts
- Right in the Jiminy Christmas

00:48.787 --> 00:52.639
- Only the fastest,
the fittest.

00:53.067 --> 00:57.119
- Gotta land it.
- And fiercest.

00:57.194 --> 01:00.072
- Ya'll like the view?
- Will advance to Boss Toad's

01:00.147 --> 01:04.832
bonus round for a chance
to win the Glittery $10,000

01:04.841 --> 01:09.352
Golden Fanny Pack and a shot
at the $100,00.

01:09.427 --> 01:11.079
- Oh!

01:11.154 --> 01:12.192
- Grand prize.

01:12.267 --> 01:13.832
- Let's go.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.632
- I'm Damon Wayans Jr.

01:15.641 --> 01:19.579
- I'm Kyle Brandt, and
this is Frogger

01:23.227 --> 01:24.792
- Six Froggers,

01:24.801 --> 01:26.352
four Crazy Crossings,

01:26.427 --> 01:29.832
$10,000 cash and more fun
than you can imagine.

01:29.907 --> 01:32.312
- The ultimate real life
video game is here.

01:32.387 --> 01:35.272
So what's our first
crossing tonight, Kyle?

01:35.347 --> 01:36.719
It's Ribbit River.

01:37.307 --> 01:40.552
Froggers must pass the powerful
jets of the waterfall,

01:40.627 --> 01:44.239
then call for the turtles
and jump a ride to the logs or

01:44.314 --> 01:47.199
take a tough shortcut
through the spinning lilies.

01:47.707 --> 01:51.232
Once they've traversed the up
and down Loco lilies foggers

01:51.307 --> 01:54.312
then need to ride the Gators
and scale the rocks before

01:54.387 --> 01:57.719
swinging home to the safety
of the landing pad.

01:58.947 --> 02:00.672
But will our Froggers
get swept

02:00.747 --> 02:04.952
away when they face
Jason waterfalls?

02:05.027 --> 02:08.399
A brutal trip across 17 inch
wide stepping stones while

02:08.474 --> 02:12.239
being pummeled by 52 gallons
of water per second

02:12.554 --> 02:16.592
and the Loco lilies rising
to 8ft off the water,

02:16.667 --> 02:18.119
you have to time your jump

02:18.194 --> 02:21.472
just right or face a lot
long drop down again.

02:21.547 --> 02:23.952
Can they conquer Ribbit River?

02:24.027 --> 02:25.312
It's the Frog father,

02:25.387 --> 02:29.352
Casey versus Jazzy
Long Legs Jackson.

02:29.427 --> 02:30.792
- Hey, I'm Casey.

02:30.867 --> 02:33.032
I'm 24 years old from
Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

02:33.107 --> 02:34.459
They call me the Frog father

02:34.534 --> 02:36.872
because I have a pet frog
that I got when I was five

02:36.947 --> 02:40.032
years old and somehow he's
still alive 20 years later.

02:40.107 --> 02:41.399
I swear my parents must have

02:41.474 --> 02:43.439
switched him at some
point when I was younger.

02:43.514 --> 02:44.759
Keep the magic alive.

02:44.834 --> 02:47.912
My strategy for this
competition is to go in, head

02:47.987 --> 02:50.272
first, not hesitate
for stop for anything.

02:50.347 --> 02:52.319
I know I've got what it
takes to win Frogger.

02:53.387 --> 02:55.312
- I am Jackson Garski.

02:55.387 --> 03:00.159
I am 21 years of age and I'm
from Littleton, Colorado.

03:00.361 --> 03:03.719
I am very good at Frogger.

03:03.987 --> 03:06.672
Anything a frog can do,
I can do better.

03:06.747 --> 03:08.472
I've got the speed.
I've got the balance.

03:08.547 --> 03:11.392
I've got the agility
and I've got the legs.

03:11.467 --> 03:14.759
They don't call me Jazzy
Long Legs for nothing.

03:17.521 --> 03:21.072
- Welcome Froggers
to Ribbit River,

03:21.147 --> 03:24.232
where the temperature is 80
degrees, the humidity is 90%

03:24.307 --> 03:27.999
and the water is
full of Piranhas.

03:28.787 --> 03:30.392
- Ready, Frogger one?
- Ready.

03:30.467 --> 03:33.472
- Here we go.
- Now in Frogger, the rules

03:33.547 --> 03:35.072
are simple. Each Frogger
starts with three lives.

03:35.147 --> 03:37.312
Whoever completes the crossing
with the most lives intact

03:37.387 --> 03:39.879
or get the furthest, moves
on to the next level.

03:39.954 --> 03:42.112
- Casey, Nice little hop,
skip and a jump there.

03:42.187 --> 03:44.152
- That was casual. Gravity
did most of the work.

03:44.161 --> 03:47.752
- I don't have the long legs
like Jackson does.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.312
- I think people are being way

03:49.387 --> 03:51.112
too careful and
methodical on this.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.392
You just have to bulldoze
your way through this.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.432
- Can't go half bulldoze.

03:54.507 --> 03:55.512
- No, you can't Bull.

03:55.587 --> 03:56.952
- You need the doze.

03:56.961 --> 03:58.672
- You need the doze.

03:58.681 --> 04:00.312
Right, Here we go.
- Go quickly.

04:00.387 --> 04:01.592
- You see,
I'm just gonna go for it.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.479
- Oh, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.
See. see.

04:03.554 --> 04:04.519
- I love the rope.

04:05.107 --> 04:07.312
- Can he find the footing?

04:07.321 --> 04:08.959
Come on, big boy.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.192
And now he's in trouble.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.719
- Yeah, he's down.

04:14.061 --> 04:15.112
He gave himself up.

04:15.187 --> 04:16.472
- He decided if he was going

04:16.547 --> 04:19.152
to go down, he was going
to go down his way.

04:19.227 --> 04:20.152
- He's balancing.

04:20.227 --> 04:23.079
And then he remembers
in gravity.

04:23.787 --> 04:25.919
- Check with your mom.

04:26.867 --> 04:27.872
- One life down.

04:27.947 --> 04:29.872
Ready, Frogger two?
- Let's go.

04:29.881 --> 04:31.632
- Here we go.
- Wins,

04:31.707 --> 04:35.312
we have heard tales of the
legendary Jazzy Long Legs.

04:35.387 --> 04:39.272
21 year old Jackson Garski
is now up to

04:39.347 --> 04:42.312
give us the show.
- He is currently wearing his

04:42.387 --> 04:46.079
little brothers dolls shorts,
but I'm okay with it.

04:46.154 --> 04:48.152
- How do I even get to this?
- You just fall.

04:48.161 --> 04:49.592
Just fall.
That's all you do.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.039
- It's about four
hops. For him,

04:51.114 --> 04:53.112
it might be two with
the size of those legs.

04:53.187 --> 04:56.112
Look at the length there.
- Go, go Gadget legs.

04:56.187 --> 04:57.672
- Inspector Gadget
in the house.

04:57.747 --> 04:59.512
Even his legs
aren't long enough.

04:59.587 --> 05:00.992
If he can't do it.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.879
Good luck to the rest
of the Froggers.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.232
- I'm just gonna have to jump.

05:05.307 --> 05:06.792
- And here we go.

05:06.867 --> 05:08.592
Jazzy Long Legs.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.752
- The jets propelling 300

05:10.827 --> 05:13.072
gallons of water
for millisecond.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.912
Oh, yes.
An actual frog on set.

05:15.987 --> 05:18.152
He reached that
perfect frog pose.

05:18.227 --> 05:21.879
Oh, he fell!
He's down, he's in.

05:22.347 --> 05:25.112
Oh, Jazzy Long Legs,
good night.

05:25.187 --> 05:26.512
- The shocking early exit.

05:26.521 --> 05:27.739
As soon as he got up,

05:27.814 --> 05:29.912
that's in the Cannon
shot him right off.

05:29.987 --> 05:33.719
Jazzy Long Legs is
dipped in water.

05:34.507 --> 05:36.472
- Don't be too hot out there.
- All right,

05:36.547 --> 05:39.312
one life down a piece.
- In a battle that visually is

05:39.387 --> 05:44.672
kind of shaping up to be
a 1999 M&M meets 1999 Mobey.

05:44.747 --> 05:46.512
- Are you seeing
any vibes of that?

05:46.587 --> 05:48.279
- Absolutely.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.792
- Here we go.
Casey at the bat.

05:51.867 --> 05:53.552
Classic American tail.

05:53.627 --> 05:55.912
- This is for you Frogger.
- Woo!

05:55.921 --> 05:57.512
- He's jumping right into it.

05:57.587 --> 05:59.832
Oh, my gosh.

05:59.907 --> 06:01.192
Terrible form.

06:01.267 --> 06:02.392
Amazing trip.

06:02.467 --> 06:03.999
That was your moment, Casey.

06:04.074 --> 06:07.719
Thank you very much
for not much.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.272
- Jazzy Long Legs.
You got this?

06:11.347 --> 06:12.959
- Look at the focus
on that guy

06:13.034 --> 06:15.999
- He's either focused
or he's praying.

06:16.587 --> 06:17.692
Second life.

06:17.694 --> 06:19.592
Can he clear the
entire waterfall?

06:19.667 --> 06:20.712
I mean, the whole thing.

06:20.787 --> 06:22.585
- Huge talent.
Huge legs.

06:22.661 --> 06:25.112
I think he's trying to see if
he can go to the second one.

06:25.187 --> 06:27.672
He got the rope.
- Oh, beautiful.

06:27.747 --> 06:29.912
What a crossing.
- what a crossing.

06:29.987 --> 06:32.152
- I told you.
- Oh, that was beautiful.

06:32.227 --> 06:35.272
- Go Jackson!
- That is how you do it.

06:35.347 --> 06:38.632
- He bulled, and he dozed.
My man.

06:38.707 --> 06:39.712
- Can we get
a mating call?

06:39.721 --> 06:42.719
- Come on, turtles.
Let's go.

06:42.794 --> 06:44.759
- That will set the Turtle
brothers in motion

06:44.834 --> 06:47.272
and Jackson is already
to Little Rock,

06:47.347 --> 06:50.672
see if he can put those
long legs to get use again.

06:50.747 --> 06:52.239
- The shorts are already
getting shorter.

06:52.314 --> 06:54.112
They seem to be shrinking
as they get wet.

06:54.187 --> 06:55.312
You relate to that Wayans?

06:55.321 --> 06:56.439
- Absolutely.

06:57.481 --> 06:59.512
- He is getting pelted.

06:59.587 --> 07:03.192
Now, will he go shortcut
to the Lily pad or go directly

07:03.267 --> 07:06.472
to Tony's brother Tommy?
Shortcut.

07:06.547 --> 07:08.992
- Oh, a hand plant.

07:09.067 --> 07:12.032
Jackson, you frog you.
- Huge

07:12.041 --> 07:14.592
jump here off the log, off
the spinning Lily pads.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.779
- Let's do it.

07:15.781 --> 07:17.032
- Alright Jackson,
you're a good guy.

07:17.107 --> 07:19.592
I need you to fall right away.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.072
Jackson says all life's best

07:21.147 --> 07:22.512
choices are made
spur of the moment.

07:22.587 --> 07:24.832
Sew it on a pillow, put
it on a Grave stone

07:24.907 --> 07:26.679
- Oh, he's got to fight.

07:26.754 --> 07:28.319
- Uh, oh.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.199
- Oh no.
- Oh no, we're in trouble.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.399
- I'm on, I'm on, I'm on.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.792
- Core baby.
- I'm on, I'm so on.

07:38.801 --> 07:40.225
- Oh, he's got to fight.
I'm so on.

07:40.301 --> 07:42.719
- He's on top.
- Jack's alive. Yes.

07:43.147 --> 07:44.959
- As with you?
- I don't know,

07:45.034 --> 07:46.919
I should be asking you.

07:49.201 --> 07:51.152
- Oh, my gosh.

07:51.161 --> 07:54.152
Easy, baby.
Room to spare.

07:54.227 --> 07:58.032
- We have never had a Frogger
complete this course.

07:58.107 --> 07:59.872
- I think Jackson is going
to cross the whole thing.

07:59.881 --> 08:02.439
I'm calling it right now.
- No problem.

08:02.714 --> 08:04.312
- He's got one
more Loco Lily

08:04.387 --> 08:06.432
and then we have a date
with the Gators.

08:06.507 --> 08:07.912
A dater as it will.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.879
- Oh shoot, that's far.

08:11.187 --> 08:13.039
- Just getting this
timing right.

08:14.987 --> 08:16.712
Oh, there we go.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.032
There we go.

08:18.107 --> 08:21.112
- Leaping like a freaking llama
- A llama?

08:21.187 --> 08:22.872
- Wait, do llamas leap?
- I don't know.

08:22.947 --> 08:23.912
This one does.

08:23.987 --> 08:25.792
- If I did that,
I can do this.

08:25.801 --> 08:27.439
Wait till it's low.

08:28.387 --> 08:30.872
Beautiful Jackson.
- Do I look like a frog?

08:30.947 --> 08:32.632
- Literally a frog right now.
-  It's happened.

08:32.707 --> 08:34.512
It's finally happened.
- I love it.

08:34.587 --> 08:36.032
Okay.
One more Lily pad.

08:36.107 --> 08:39.672
- This one's on moving
and he's got it.

08:39.747 --> 08:43.352
- Next up, we have Instigator
and his brother irrigator.

08:43.427 --> 08:44.792
- Hey fishy, fishy.

08:44.867 --> 08:46.032
- He bites.
Be careful.

08:46.107 --> 08:47.472
- Come,
come bite me.

08:47.547 --> 08:49.832
- Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

08:49.907 --> 08:52.912
- I'm just gonna give him a
big old crocodile hug.

08:52.987 --> 08:55.119
- They are not friendly.

08:57.587 --> 08:58.879
- Oh no.

08:59.187 --> 09:01.439
- Took that one to the
chin.

09:02.707 --> 09:04.559
- Right here, he's got it.
Smooth.

09:04.634 --> 09:06.752
Understand, folks,
we are at the end.

09:06.761 --> 09:09.119
I'm coming for you
Finish Lily Pat.

09:10.107 --> 09:11.552
- You have tall shoulders.

09:11.627 --> 09:12.719
- He does.

09:14.227 --> 09:16.912
- And he is off on a classic
rock and he's alive.

09:16.921 --> 09:18.592
- Y'all like the view?

09:18.601 --> 09:21.112
- Now we are
just one little jump away

09:21.187 --> 09:23.552
to hard rock and a rope
swing and we are home.

09:23.627 --> 09:25.479
- I think I'm
gonna have to jump.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.919
- Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
we're at the top of hard rock.

09:28.994 --> 09:32.832
- 21 year old Jackson grabbing
the Hollywood Vine.

09:32.907 --> 09:34.879
We've seen Frogger
fail this jump.

09:34.954 --> 09:37.199
Can Jazzy's Long Legs do it?

09:37.707 --> 09:39.752
- Huge legs,
preposterous legs.

09:39.827 --> 09:41.912
He can easily tight
rope across it.

09:41.987 --> 09:43.912
Just tight rope right
across your own legs.

09:43.987 --> 09:46.952
- That's why they pay Damon
Wayans Jr. The big bucks.

09:47.027 --> 09:50.072
And here comes Jackson
blowing kisses.

09:50.147 --> 09:53.472
One swing away from sweet,
sweet victory.

09:53.547 --> 09:56.552
One small step for Jackson.

09:56.627 --> 09:59.159
One giant leap
for Jazzy Long Legs.

09:59.587 --> 10:00.839
- Let's go.

10:11.107 --> 10:12.952
- Jackson Jazzy Long Leg.

10:13.027 --> 10:14.712
He is on his second life.

10:14.721 --> 10:15.992
- Let's go.

10:16.067 --> 10:17.432
- He can take this out if he

10:17.507 --> 10:19.872
makes it across
to the final Lily pad.

10:19.947 --> 10:21.232
- Whoa

10:21.307 --> 10:23.839
- Oh, the legs are too short.

10:24.481 --> 10:25.472
Oh,no.

10:25.547 --> 10:27.232
- Oh, my god
careful.

10:27.307 --> 10:28.552
- Oh, my god.

10:28.627 --> 10:29.825
I can't look.

10:29.901 --> 10:32.199
I can't look, tell
me what happens.

10:33.474 --> 10:35.199
(Jackson screaming)

10:35.947 --> 10:37.399
- Oh Jackson.

10:38.227 --> 10:39.659
- All right, he
composed himself.

10:39.734 --> 10:41.392
That makes one of us.
- Goodness gracious me.

10:41.401 --> 10:42.592
That was frustrating.

10:42.667 --> 10:44.032
- Yeah, that's
one word for it.

10:44.107 --> 10:45.192
- It's never been done.

10:45.267 --> 10:47.432
This is effectively
the three minute mile.

10:47.507 --> 10:49.799
- Kyle, I'm nervous, man.
- I'm terrified

10:50.101 --> 10:51.632
- For the light
of the full moon.

10:51.707 --> 10:53.199
He is

10:53.634 --> 10:56.312
across! across!

10:56.387 --> 10:58.072
(cheering)

10:58.147 --> 11:00.432
- You beautiful man,
you've done it.

11:00.507 --> 11:02.392
- Let's go!

11:02.467 --> 11:03.599
- Yeah!

11:03.954 --> 11:06.632
Jackson conquers Ribbit River.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.025
Whoo!!

11:08.101 --> 11:10.559
- Just because I'm skinny,
doesn't mean I can't win

11:10.634 --> 11:11.592
Frogger.

11:11.667 --> 11:12.792
- What did we just witness?

11:12.867 --> 11:13.872
- I don't know.

11:13.947 --> 11:14.952
- So many highlights.

11:15.027 --> 11:16.439
- Pop Quiz, Wayans.

11:16.514 --> 11:20.199
Who is the first ever Frogger
to cross Ribbit River?

11:20.274 --> 11:24.559
- Jackson Jazzy Long Legs.
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

11:24.867 --> 11:28.392
Jazzy Long Legs trending world-
wide after Jackson has knocked

11:28.467 --> 11:31.912
out Casey to become tonight's
first Frogger into the Boss

11:31.987 --> 11:33.992
Toad bonus round.
Who's gonna be joining him

11:34.067 --> 11:36.592
to battle it out for the
$10,000 Golden Fanny Pack?

11:36.667 --> 11:41.312
We're about to find out.
This crossing is gonna hit

11:41.387 --> 11:45.279
that sweet spot because
we're headed for Candy frog.

11:45.354 --> 11:48.912
- Yeah, Froggers
will start by hopping

11:48.987 --> 11:51.919
between the conveyor belt
tracks to remove all four

11:51.994 --> 11:54.519
gumballs without
going out of bound.

11:54.594 --> 11:55.792
Bouncing over the giant

11:55.867 --> 11:57.472
Jawbreakers will get them
to the candy canes,

11:57.547 --> 12:00.039
which Froggers can use
to swing to the chocolate

12:00.114 --> 12:02.959
bars, dodging the licorice,
the leap to the smores

12:03.034 --> 12:05.272
and plant the candle
on the cupcake before taking

12:05.347 --> 12:07.799
the licorice bridge
to the landing pad.

12:09.187 --> 12:13.839
It's a high calorie crossing
and made the best Frogger win.

12:13.914 --> 12:17.512
But who will make it pass
the Jawbreaker?

12:17.521 --> 12:20.032
This inflated, slippery sphere

12:20.041 --> 12:23.312
is not as sweet as it looks
with enough bounce to have

12:23.387 --> 12:25.792
Froggers sliding all
the way into the water.

12:25.867 --> 12:28.719
And the candy
cane monkey bars.

12:28.794 --> 12:31.352
An energy zapping 18 foot

12:31.427 --> 12:34.319
horizontal traverse
right over the water.

12:35.187 --> 12:36.792
It's the Queen of New York,

12:36.867 --> 12:40.232
Nadica versus gamer girl, Zoe.

12:40.307 --> 12:42.952
- My name is
Nadica Robishow.

12:42.961 --> 12:45.959
The Queen of New York
has arrived.

12:46.467 --> 12:48.592
By day, I work in health
care. By night,

12:48.667 --> 12:50.472
I'm a body builder.

12:50.547 --> 12:52.232
People just assume that I'm

12:52.241 --> 12:55.392
just cute and pretty and that
I can't do anything else.

12:55.467 --> 12:57.392
But you can be strong.

12:57.467 --> 13:02.439
Sexy, powerful,
feminine, and still win.

13:03.987 --> 13:05.592
- Hi, I'm Zoe.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.032
I am 26 years old

13:07.107 --> 13:09.992
from Chicago, Illinois, and
I'm a full time gamer girl.

13:10.067 --> 13:12.759
I stream around
four times a week.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.192
My edge in Frogger
is my strength.

13:15.267 --> 13:18.879
I am going level up
and win this thing.

13:19.801 --> 13:21.552
Ready Frogger one?

13:21.627 --> 13:24.919
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

13:29.867 --> 13:31.792
Nadica Robishow.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.259
A self described,

13:33.334 --> 13:35.999
loud and proud New Yorker is
if there's any other kind.

13:36.074 --> 13:40.112
All four gumballs need to be
knocked forward into the water

13:40.187 --> 13:41.792
before you can go
on to the next stage.

13:41.867 --> 13:43.192
She looks like she's

13:43.267 --> 13:44.992
eyeing the pink one to match
those shorts.

13:45.001 --> 13:47.559
- She's gotta jump. She's
gonna be out of bounds.

13:47.634 --> 13:48.992
- Just taking her time.

13:49.067 --> 13:51.952
She's in danger of going
out of bounds here.

13:52.027 --> 13:54.399
- Oh no, Nadica.

13:54.907 --> 13:55.872
Not allowed.

13:55.947 --> 13:57.992
- Oh, that's out of bounds.

13:58.067 --> 14:00.959
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

14:02.347 --> 14:03.792
- you look
for silver linings here.

14:03.867 --> 14:05.265
She did burn a life,

14:05.341 --> 14:09.432
but her hair is exactly as
it started and she's bone dry.

14:09.507 --> 14:10.439
(Laughs)

14:10.867 --> 14:12.759
Ready Frogger two?

14:13.034 --> 14:14.912
- Yes.
- Here we go.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.072
- Chicago, Illinois,

14:16.081 --> 14:18.279
Zoe Khan ready to unleash

14:18.354 --> 14:21.912
the wrath of Khan
on the candy conveyor.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.912
One Gumball down,

14:23.987 --> 14:26.112
and I already feel like
she's ahead of Nadica.

14:26.121 --> 14:30.472
- She literally is.
- A live streaming gamer

14:30.547 --> 14:32.279
welcome to our game.

14:33.467 --> 14:34.799
- Stream that!

14:35.354 --> 14:38.272
- Fun fact, Zoe is
a very sporty person.

14:38.347 --> 14:42.912
Volleyball, soccer, softball
and my favorite, Call of Duty.

14:42.987 --> 14:44.672
- Hey now, my favorite sport.

14:44.747 --> 14:47.552
- I love Call of Duty,
but normally, when I go in,

14:47.627 --> 14:50.352
it's just a bunch of kids and
my headset swearing at me.

14:50.427 --> 14:53.632
All right, options here
on Candy Frog land.

14:53.707 --> 14:55.672
You can go
for the Jawbreakers,

14:55.681 --> 14:58.312
or you can opt to choose
the Lily pad,

14:58.387 --> 15:00.992
which is a further target,
but an easier landing.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.612
Let's see if she takes it
Wayan.

15:02.687 --> 15:06.079
- The conveyor does not stop,
she's going for the jawbreaker

15:06.601 --> 15:08.879
- Oh, she's going down.

15:10.347 --> 15:13.112
The live streamer now,
live swimming.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.472
Much different and much
wetter than Nadica.

15:16.481 --> 15:18.952
- Sometimes we say, well,
they burned the lives,

15:18.961 --> 15:22.759
but at least they made some
good progress, not Nadica.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.192
But I hope she on a lesson.

15:24.267 --> 15:27.032
You have to jump across
the conveyer belt.

15:27.107 --> 15:28.792
- Well, blue Gumball
well into the water.

15:28.867 --> 15:30.312
Nadica, we're gonna
get through this.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.632
Nadica's favorite
movie is Dirty Dancing.

15:32.707 --> 15:34.112
Did you know that?
- No, I didn't.

15:34.187 --> 15:35.432
I just hope the candy conveyor

15:35.507 --> 15:37.279
doesn't put her
in the corner again.

15:37.947 --> 15:40.192
We got one more. We got
the pink Gumball left.

15:40.267 --> 15:42.272
- This is great, this
is how the Frogger

15:42.347 --> 15:44.439
video games played back
and forth, back and forth.

15:44.514 --> 15:45.792
So many jumps.

15:45.867 --> 15:48.072
She's headed for
the Jawbreaker.

15:48.147 --> 15:49.599
She's got to move quickly.

15:53.067 --> 15:57.879
- Oh! She's down,
deep blue sea, she gone.

15:58.387 --> 16:00.832
There's a really strong leap.
She went to the side.

16:00.907 --> 16:02.039
you can't go to the side.

16:02.114 --> 16:03.552
You got to go right
on top of it.

16:03.627 --> 16:05.712
It's so easy for us to sit
here and say that we're not

16:05.787 --> 16:08.279
out there on the candy conveyor
because they won't let us.

16:10.001 --> 16:12.759
- Zoe Khan about to go
for life number two.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.992
She wants that
Golden Fanny Pack.

16:15.001 --> 16:18.192
And now she's back at the spot
where she last fell off.

16:18.267 --> 16:20.272
Has she learned her lesson?

16:20.281 --> 16:22.519
- Oh, my gosh. That
was a great jump.

16:22.987 --> 16:25.559
- She's alive and well,
we're playing Frogger.

16:26.067 --> 16:27.832
- It looked like she
rewound herself.

16:27.907 --> 16:30.479
Turns a break dance move.

16:31.227 --> 16:33.319
(makes beatbox sound)

16:33.661 --> 16:34.899
Hey!

16:34.974 --> 16:38.559
Oh yes, this online gamer
zeroing in, aggressive.

16:39.147 --> 16:42.792
- Zoe's a little bit,
she is jacked. Trapezoids,

16:42.867 --> 16:45.359
what are these?
- I think they're trapezius.

16:45.434 --> 16:47.952
The trapezoid is
from a geometry class.

16:48.027 --> 16:50.399
- That's what I meant.
I meant trapezius.

16:51.034 --> 16:52.552
- But now
you're worried about

16:52.561 --> 16:54.712
that because she
is left stranded.

16:54.721 --> 16:56.432
She didn't time it right.

16:56.507 --> 16:57.792
- Does it come back?

16:57.867 --> 16:59.799
Try not to fall.

17:00.627 --> 17:01.625
- Here we go, folks.

17:01.701 --> 17:04.159
A test of endurance
for Zoe Khan.

17:04.794 --> 17:05.752
- Come back.

17:05.827 --> 17:08.032
- She is holding
on for dear life.

17:08.107 --> 17:09.152
- Wow.
Look at this.

17:09.227 --> 17:11.032
- Those fingertips
just holding

17:11.107 --> 17:14.159
on like, Nope, we
ain't falling today.

17:15.027 --> 17:16.185
I am so nervous.

17:16.261 --> 17:18.472
I just felt my butt
cheeks clench.

17:18.547 --> 17:19.472
There it goes again.

17:19.547 --> 17:20.472
- I felt them too.

17:20.547 --> 17:22.039
And again.

17:24.267 --> 17:26.519
This is getting scary,
here we go.

17:35.827 --> 17:39.479
- This is life number
two for Zoe Khan.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.472
She is hanging on for dear
life here on the candy bars.

17:43.481 --> 17:45.712
This is getting scary,
here we go.

17:45.721 --> 17:47.392
- Oh, man.
- That is one of the most

17:47.467 --> 17:48.999
graceful landings
we've ever seen.

17:49.074 --> 17:50.792
- She was like, oh.
- She had her paws up?

17:50.867 --> 17:51.999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:53.801 --> 17:55.312
Okay, here we go. Our old
friends, the cricket crunches

17:55.387 --> 17:57.032
- Gotta get
under or as we've seen,

17:57.107 --> 17:59.392
sometimes over
the Red Licorice bridge

17:59.467 --> 18:01.512
and onto the second
cricket crunch.

18:01.587 --> 18:03.279
- And here she goes.

18:04.187 --> 18:06.192
Oh, she's down.

18:06.267 --> 18:08.672
That's two lives
down for Zoe Khan.

18:08.747 --> 18:12.239
But she had a great run there
that could all but seal it.

18:12.867 --> 18:14.512
But Nadica Robishow, Wayans.

18:14.587 --> 18:18.112
Say it again with me,
Nadica Robishow

18:18.187 --> 18:21.312
remember the name on her
third life now, Wayans.

18:21.387 --> 18:23.472
She needs to get to those
cricket crunches.

18:23.547 --> 18:25.072
- Jawbreaker or lily,
call your shot.

18:25.081 --> 18:26.952
- I mean, Jawbreaker, but.
- You want to go

18:27.027 --> 18:29.032
for the Jawbreaker,
but you're not out there.

18:29.107 --> 18:34.072
It's easy for us to say, Whoa,
- What is going on here?

18:34.147 --> 18:36.032
- Oh no.
- Oh, not even close.

18:36.107 --> 18:38.472
Nadica, not going to happen.

18:38.547 --> 18:40.752
- Nah- Dica

18:40.827 --> 18:41.912
- That will do it.

18:41.987 --> 18:43.472
Zoe moves on.

18:43.547 --> 18:46.392
What a match.
- A big congrats to Zoe.

18:46.467 --> 18:49.072
Zoe's now through to the Boss
Toad bonus round.

18:49.081 --> 18:51.312
Who else will be joining
her in tonight's show down?

18:51.387 --> 18:53.639
We are about to find
out my friends.

18:53.947 --> 18:55.559
Next up, we'll get your eye

18:55.634 --> 18:59.272
patches out, folks, because we
are off to Frog Skull Island.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.152
After swinging
to the Jolly Frogger,

19:01.227 --> 19:03.632
Froggers will have to walk
the planks, climb the cargo

19:03.707 --> 19:07.199
net and fetch a cracker.
Crossing back across the deck.

19:07.274 --> 19:10.072
They'll catch a ride with  Polly
the parrot to the desert island.

19:10.147 --> 19:12.112
Then they'll need to get over

19:12.121 --> 19:15.119
the rocks, past the skull
and over the Gators.

19:15.507 --> 19:17.112
Pelted by water cannons.

19:17.121 --> 19:18.425
They'll make their way across

19:18.427 --> 19:21.039
the lilies and finally
to the spinning X,

19:21.114 --> 19:24.639
which marks the spot for their
final leap to the treasure.

19:25.147 --> 19:26.872
- What's the deal?
I thought we were both

19:26.947 --> 19:28.205
dressing up as
Pirates for this.

19:28.281 --> 19:30.392
What's going on?
- I am dressed as a pirate.

19:30.467 --> 19:31.992
- Where's your hat?

19:32.067 --> 19:34.432
- This pirate was raised
to take his hat off indoors.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.992
- Well, now I look like an idiot
because I'm the only one

19:37.067 --> 19:39.072
with the hat, an eye
patch and a parrot.

19:39.147 --> 19:41.472
- I have a parrot.
- I don't see a parrot.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.079
- He's at lunch.

19:46.147 --> 19:47.192
- Frog Skull Island

19:47.201 --> 19:49.512
welcomes coach Joe Ippolito

19:49.587 --> 19:53.312
versus Will Sanchez,
the B boy break dancer.

19:53.387 --> 19:55.512
He makes a living out on the
street collecting dollars.

19:55.587 --> 19:57.872
And we can't wait to see some
moves today here, Wayans.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.432
- It's going to be glorious.

20:00.507 --> 20:02.232
I'm Joe Ippolito.

20:02.307 --> 20:05.232
I am 33 years old
from Phoenix, Arizona.

20:05.307 --> 20:08.312
I coach a basketball team
called the Tempe Hawks.

20:08.387 --> 20:10.272
It's a Special Olympics
basketball team.

20:10.347 --> 20:12.832
I'm also a stage four
cancer survivor.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.439
I'm currently in remission

20:14.514 --> 20:18.192
and happy to be so. Frogger
is a lot like my life.

20:18.267 --> 20:19.352
He's out there just trying

20:19.427 --> 20:20.872
to do what he's
doing in obstacles

20:20.947 --> 20:23.152
just keep throwing in his way
and just like how Frogger just

20:23.161 --> 20:25.079
keeps overcoming whatever
is in front of him.

20:25.154 --> 20:26.632
That's what I've
done in my life.

20:26.707 --> 20:28.105
So if you want to throw

20:28.181 --> 20:30.352
an alligator or some traffic
at me, I can take that out.

20:30.427 --> 20:32.672
Hi.
My name is William Sanchez.

20:32.747 --> 20:34.452
I'm 38 years old.

20:34.528 --> 20:37.079
I am a break dancer and I'm
from the Bronx, New York City.

20:37.587 --> 20:38.712
I turn break dancing

20:38.787 --> 20:40.999
into my money maker
like street performing.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.392
That's my bread and butter.

20:42.467 --> 20:45.472
As a solo performer, I've
opened up Janet Jackson,

20:45.481 --> 20:49.432
NSYNC, Kanye West. I'm
bringing home the Frogger Crown

20:49.507 --> 20:53.079
for Puerto Ricans and
New York. Bronx represent.

20:55.347 --> 20:58.392
- I'm taking you down.
- You first, my friend.

20:58.467 --> 21:01.199
- Ready, Frogger One?
- Coach ready, coach.

21:01.274 --> 21:05.079
- Here we go.
- Let's go, Joe.

21:05.154 --> 21:06.159
Come on, let's go.

21:06.234 --> 21:07.439
- Frog Skull Island

21:07.514 --> 21:09.632
welcomes Joe Ippolito
to eleven and a half foot

21:09.707 --> 21:12.232
swinging right to the Port
side of the Jolly Frogger off

21:12.307 --> 21:15.272
the bat and we've
got plank walking.

21:15.347 --> 21:17.079
- You got this.
Come on.

21:17.081 --> 21:18.512
They go in and out like that
to the cargo net.

21:18.587 --> 21:19.799
Look out!

21:19.874 --> 21:22.599
Cargo net's claimed many
foggers, but not Coach Joe.

21:22.674 --> 21:24.032
Look at those arms.

21:24.107 --> 21:25.799
Those muscles are pumping.
If you got it,

21:25.874 --> 21:27.472
flaunt it, my friend.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.712
He goes to the barrel
for the crackers.

21:29.787 --> 21:31.139
No shortcuts.

21:31.214 --> 21:33.912
- You know, Joe has an entire
arcade in his house.

21:33.987 --> 21:35.272
- Does he have a wife
in his house?

21:35.347 --> 21:38.112
Cause I wouldn't.
- I mean, not with an arcade.

21:38.187 --> 21:39.319
Who needs a wife?

21:40.267 --> 21:41.992
- My captain, my captain.
Here we go.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.999
- Oh, my God.

21:44.281 --> 21:47.872
- Cracker goes to the side
and he goes for a ride.

21:47.947 --> 21:52.072
Polly takes off traveling
75 feet in 6 seconds.

21:52.081 --> 21:53.472
Unleashed the cannons.

21:53.547 --> 21:55.319
Gotta land it.

21:55.394 --> 21:56.672
And he's down!

21:56.747 --> 21:57.952
Frogger down.

21:58.027 --> 22:00.152
- Oh, my gosh.
- Spectacular.

22:00.227 --> 22:02.992
Oh, there's a little
showboating there. Watch.

22:03.001 --> 22:05.392
- I'm gonna win
this whole thing.

22:05.467 --> 22:07.672
- That's when gravity is like,
psych!

22:07.747 --> 22:08.912
- Right to the rib cage.

22:08.987 --> 22:11.199
He crashed lands
on the desert island.

22:11.274 --> 22:13.712
One life down, two to go.

22:13.787 --> 22:15.552
And now everyone should know.

22:15.627 --> 22:20.152
Will Sanchez coming
in at 6'2, 213 pounds.

22:20.227 --> 22:22.272
This is the biggest man
we got on the course.

22:22.347 --> 22:24.192
And I mean,
in the entire tournament,

22:24.267 --> 22:26.832
he might actually be
bigger than Boss Toad.

22:26.907 --> 22:28.559
(both laugh)

22:28.901 --> 22:30.912
Frog eat frog world here.

22:30.987 --> 22:33.152
- Ready, Frogger Two?
- Yeah.

22:33.227 --> 22:36.672
- Here we go.
- Big Will.

22:36.747 --> 22:38.232
Welcome to Frog Skull Island.

22:38.307 --> 22:40.072
Will the rope
even support him?

22:40.147 --> 22:41.759
Look at the size of that man.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.472
An absolute unit.

22:43.547 --> 22:44.952
And we're off.

22:45.027 --> 22:48.232
Easy now to the porch side
of that Jolly Froggen.

22:48.241 --> 22:51.432
A nimble move here in the
technicolor pants.

22:51.507 --> 22:52.705
- Wow.

22:52.781 --> 22:54.672
- Okay, I'm impressed already
by how nimble is,

22:54.747 --> 22:56.232
but look out,

22:56.307 --> 22:57.519
- Strong.

22:57.594 --> 22:58.912
He's so big.

22:58.987 --> 23:01.192
He's the size
of the boat itself.

23:01.267 --> 23:02.912
He's more of an anchor,
really.

23:02.987 --> 23:04.472
You know who I'm
worried about?

23:04.547 --> 23:06.106
Polly.

23:06.181 --> 23:07.079
I don't know if she's
gonna drag this big guy.

23:07.154 --> 23:08.752
I hope she's
Carbo Loading right now.

23:08.827 --> 23:09.799
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

23:09.874 --> 23:10.945
Come on.
Come on, Polly.

23:11.021 --> 23:12.472
Come on, little birdy.
Bend your knees.

23:12.547 --> 23:15.359
Get down.
Don't lift with your back.

23:15.707 --> 23:17.872
We saw what happened to Joe.

23:17.947 --> 23:19.472
Let's not make the
same mistake here.

23:19.547 --> 23:20.712
- He parked it perfectly!

23:20.787 --> 23:22.312
- Beautiful Frogger
right there.

23:22.387 --> 23:23.479
- That's what you're
supposed to do.

23:23.554 --> 23:24.919
- Woohoo!

23:25.267 --> 23:26.672
- We got a huge jump here.

23:26.747 --> 23:28.159
Coming up to Alt Rock.

23:29.547 --> 23:31.999
He's up, he's down!

23:32.467 --> 23:35.392
Down goes Frogger.
- How's the water?

23:35.467 --> 23:37.672
- He actually went
down when he jumped.

23:37.747 --> 23:38.992
Oh, not even close.

23:39.067 --> 23:41.672
- You got a leap like a frog.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.872
It's called elevation.

23:43.947 --> 23:45.432
- Define it, can you?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.439
I'm not sure Will
knows what it is.

23:47.514 --> 23:48.872
- I don't think he does.

23:48.947 --> 23:50.172
- Boom.

23:50.174 --> 23:53.072
- Can Coach Joe...
- Cold buddy, or what?

23:53.147 --> 23:55.792
- Make the play of his
life and conquer

23:55.867 --> 23:58.112
Frog Skull island.
We're about to find out.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.552
- I think he's nervous.
I think Coach is nervous.

24:00.627 --> 24:01.519
- Be the frog.

24:01.594 --> 24:02.752
Be the frog.
Be the frog.

24:02.827 --> 24:04.999
We better call a
twenty second time out.

24:13.587 --> 24:14.952
- You got this?
- Be the frog.

24:15.027 --> 24:16.952
Be the frog.
- Joe's, second life.

24:17.027 --> 24:18.752
Think Bill Belichick
at halftime.

24:18.827 --> 24:20.425
Sean McVeigh.
Here we go.

24:20.427 --> 24:23.632
Can he start moving that body
to create the momentum?

24:23.707 --> 24:25.472
He's trying and he's got it.

24:25.481 --> 24:27.872
Coach Joe is alive.
- You know what?

24:27.881 --> 24:29.159
I'm just gonna go for it.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.512
- And here we go, folks.
We got a grip.

24:31.587 --> 24:34.439
Can he hold on?
Can he keep himself up?

24:35.547 --> 24:36.559
And he's down!

24:38.307 --> 24:40.192
- He needed more runway!

24:40.267 --> 24:42.072
- What did you want
them to do? Show us?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.599
- You back up...

24:43.674 --> 24:45.032
- And then you keep going.

24:45.041 --> 24:47.159
- Back up a little more.

24:47.234 --> 24:48.912
- And then there you go.

24:48.987 --> 24:52.432
All right, second life. Will's
got a long runway, folks.

24:52.441 --> 24:56.119
This is a 747 trying
to get off the runway.

24:58.507 --> 24:59.399
- Yeah, we got it!

24:59.474 --> 25:01.032
- Now that's how
you play Frogger.

25:01.107 --> 25:02.285
That's how you play.

25:02.361 --> 25:04.672
That's good Frogger
down to Hard Rock.

25:04.747 --> 25:06.165
- Wow.

25:06.241 --> 25:08.952
- That imposing, terrifying
face is Devil Skull Rock.

25:09.027 --> 25:10.472
And now he's in the lead.

25:10.547 --> 25:11.632
Devil Skull Rock.

25:11.707 --> 25:12.879
Based on the actual size

25:12.954 --> 25:14.632
of Will's heads,
that's how they did it.

25:14.641 --> 25:17.312
He is that big of a Frogger.
Look at him.

25:17.387 --> 25:19.112
He's a tooth sandwich.

25:19.187 --> 25:21.712
That skull is having
a big meal today.

25:21.721 --> 25:26.199
As we ease under the incisors.
- Will stop playing dentist.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.512
- All right, so now Will,
if he can free the fish,

25:28.587 --> 25:30.385
he has to launch it
into the water,

25:30.387 --> 25:34.352
which means every residence
on Alligator Alley will be set

25:34.427 --> 25:35.992
free because they
love that fish.

25:36.067 --> 25:37.152
I'm like.
Oh, no.

25:37.227 --> 25:38.512
He's gonna free himself.

25:38.521 --> 25:40.712
This is getting scary.
Here we go.

25:40.787 --> 25:42.352
- Oh!

25:42.427 --> 25:44.032
- Oh no.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.472
He didn't need to jump.

25:46.547 --> 25:48.072
He's six foot 83.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.519
He coulda reached down
and got the fish.

25:50.594 --> 25:52.072
These are that big.

25:52.147 --> 25:53.712
Gotta tie those shoes.

25:53.787 --> 25:57.352
Wayans, you do not want a knot
to knock you into the water.

25:57.427 --> 26:01.712
All right, Coach Joe on his
third and final life.

26:01.787 --> 26:04.952
If he misses this first jump
onto Alt Rock,

26:05.027 --> 26:08.472
he will be shorter than
Will, and he's out.

26:08.547 --> 26:10.592
Not a great posture
right off the bat.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.192
That's a posture of defeat.

26:12.267 --> 26:13.952
And I need you
to shake that off.

26:14.027 --> 26:15.159
All right, Joe?

26:15.234 --> 26:16.799
- Wow.
- Joseph?

26:16.874 --> 26:18.752
Coach Joe Ippolito,
jump of his life!

26:18.827 --> 26:21.592
He's got it.
Get up there, Joe!

26:21.667 --> 26:22.672
Yes, sir.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.959
Coach Joe is alive, Wayans!

26:28.347 --> 26:30.792
Come on, Joe, you're not out
of the woods just yet, buddy.

26:30.867 --> 26:32.512
- He's doing the lean.

26:32.587 --> 26:33.799
- That's not gonna work.

26:33.801 --> 26:37.559
Get into little
John's Skull right now.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.959
- Come on, please fall.
Please fall, please fall.

26:43.747 --> 26:45.552
- He's alive!
He's alive.

26:45.627 --> 26:46.759
He's stuck it.
- Wow.

26:46.834 --> 26:49.119
- Coach Joe.
- And he's now tied Will.

26:49.194 --> 26:52.632
Which means even if
he falls now, he is alive.

26:52.707 --> 26:56.232
- We have a game on our hands
right damn now.

26:56.307 --> 26:58.912
- And he's in trouble.
- Them legs are shaken.

26:58.987 --> 27:00.119
I'm not sure we've seen

27:00.194 --> 27:02.272
anybody scale the front
of the face like this.

27:02.347 --> 27:04.112
Look it, he's put
the foot on the gum.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.919
The fish is about
to be free.

27:06.627 --> 27:08.559
Who the hell tied this knot?
Auntie Anne's?

27:08.634 --> 27:11.079
Come on, now.

27:11.787 --> 27:14.112
And the fish is free.

27:14.187 --> 27:15.672
The Gators are loose.

27:15.747 --> 27:18.152
All three of them $10,000

27:18.227 --> 27:21.552
at stake as he goes full
Mount on our first alligator.

27:21.627 --> 27:22.672
That's Jack Snappy.

27:22.747 --> 27:23.992
He is officially in the lead

27:24.067 --> 27:26.752
in front of Will Sanchez,
hopefully is taking notes.

27:26.827 --> 27:28.479
- I'm nervous now.

27:30.554 --> 27:33.559
- Right in the
Jiminy Christmas.

27:34.721 --> 27:35.999
- Oh!

27:37.107 --> 27:39.839
That dude just
pulverized his perineum.

27:39.914 --> 27:43.352
- Wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow.

27:43.427 --> 27:45.519
- Now he goes to Jack.
And hold on.

27:45.594 --> 27:48.352
We got a problem.
Upper body strength.

27:48.361 --> 27:51.392
Oh, come on, Joe.
Get up.

27:51.467 --> 27:54.032
He's just trying to hold on.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.392
Come on, Joe.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.559
Can he hold on?

28:00.027 --> 28:02.712
Work those knees, baby.

28:02.787 --> 28:04.679
- Wait a minute.

28:04.754 --> 28:06.352
Oh, my gosh.
- Wow.

28:06.427 --> 28:09.592
This is why you lift all them
weights, Joe.

28:09.601 --> 28:10.825
- This guy's ripped.

28:10.901 --> 28:13.112
Look at those tri's, man.
- I'm trying not to.

28:13.187 --> 28:14.512
And I'm trying to say focused.

28:14.587 --> 28:17.079
- Come on, Joe.
You gotta go.

28:19.107 --> 28:20.872
Joe, don't do what I think.

28:20.947 --> 28:21.992
Joe, what are you doing?

28:22.067 --> 28:23.432
- What he thinks is

28:23.507 --> 28:25.472
he can get a better
angle on the Lily pad.

28:25.547 --> 28:27.992
- Not gonna happen.
The tail is so thin.

28:28.067 --> 28:30.472
- Here we go.
Yo, Joe!

28:30.481 --> 28:33.032
- Wow!
Oh my God! He did it!

28:33.041 --> 28:35.112
- Are you kidding me?

28:35.187 --> 28:36.872
- This guy's a hero.
- Wow.

28:36.881 --> 28:40.559
- We are coming up on
Punk Rock.

28:41.027 --> 28:43.559
This rock is harder
than it looks.

28:44.147 --> 28:45.679
- Oh, oh oh!

28:46.227 --> 28:48.592
He's down. He is out.

28:48.667 --> 28:51.759
- Absolutely. Give it up
for a Coach Joe.

28:51.834 --> 28:53.319
Coach of the year.
- Wow.

28:53.394 --> 28:55.719
- Vince Lombardi.
Red Auerbach

28:55.794 --> 28:57.352
John Wooden and
Joe Ippolito

28:57.361 --> 29:00.552
from Phoenix,
Arizona. He's a hero.

29:00.627 --> 29:03.672
Imagine here the task
for Will Sanchez.

29:03.747 --> 29:06.472
He hit the surrender
code repose sometimes.

29:06.547 --> 29:08.552
He was up here.
Can't believe what he's

29:08.627 --> 29:11.592
doing, but he needs to go
into strike mode because if he

29:11.667 --> 29:14.679
crosses right now,
he's going to Boss Toad.

29:16.994 --> 29:19.392
All right,
he better be praying

29:19.467 --> 29:21.152
because he's got to get
out of the mouth.

29:21.227 --> 29:25.552
Up to the fish, set it free
and oh it is slippery.

29:25.627 --> 29:27.352
213 pounds.

29:27.427 --> 29:29.672
He is a super heavy
weight...

29:29.747 --> 29:31.479
- Oh!
- And down he goes!

29:32.667 --> 29:36.552
- Oh, and Will goes home.

29:36.561 --> 29:41.152
Hey, Joe, you are going
to the Boss Toad bonus round.

29:41.227 --> 29:43.752
- What does that even mean?
I'm so excited!

29:43.827 --> 29:46.032
- Way to go, man.
Well done.

29:46.107 --> 29:48.032
- Congratulations
to my new idol, Joe.

29:48.041 --> 29:49.392
Tonight's final Frogger

29:49.467 --> 29:51.592
through to the Boss
Toad bonus round.

29:51.667 --> 29:52.992
But we know this only one

29:53.067 --> 29:55.632
Frogger can be
tonight's top frog.

29:55.641 --> 29:57.199
Stay tuned, my friends.

30:04.107 --> 30:06.159
(ominous music)

30:07.474 --> 30:10.639
- He has never had
a singing lesson.

30:11.274 --> 30:13.432
He is responsible

30:13.441 --> 30:17.879
for kidnapping countless
baby froglets.

30:17.954 --> 30:21.239
He is a black belt
in mansplaining.

30:22.027 --> 30:26.359
He is a Boss Toad.

30:31.361 --> 30:33.879
- Boss Toad. Homeboy
is a straight up evil jerk.

30:33.954 --> 30:35.072
All right?

30:35.147 --> 30:37.199
He kidnaps baby froglets
every single week.

30:37.274 --> 30:38.392
- Not baby froglets.

30:38.467 --> 30:40.272
He kidnaps froglets
every single week.

30:40.347 --> 30:43.239
- Kyle, now is not the time.

30:44.507 --> 30:46.272
- Boss Toad has
frog napped five

30:46.347 --> 30:48.952
froglets and hidden them
across the most challenging

30:48.961 --> 30:50.799
Frogger crossing
of them all,

30:50.874 --> 30:52.479
Boss Toad's Temple.

30:53.187 --> 30:54.579
Our Frogger's each get five

30:54.654 --> 30:56.832
minutes to rescue those
froglets as many as they can

30:56.907 --> 31:00.832
and they can choose any route
they want to get the job done.

31:00.841 --> 31:02.032
But they only have one life.

31:02.107 --> 31:04.719
So if they fall in, game over.

31:05.707 --> 31:09.632
Taking on this epic Endgame
tonight to win the $10,000

31:09.641 --> 31:14.512
Golden Fanny Pack and a place
in $100,000 series finale,

31:14.521 --> 31:19.239
our three final Froggers.
Jackson Jazzy Long Legs.

31:19.314 --> 31:22.632
The only Frogger
to complete Rivet River.

31:22.707 --> 31:26.599
Joe Iffalito. He took
on the Gators and he won.

31:28.027 --> 31:30.192
But first to take
on the course tonight.

31:30.267 --> 31:32.239
Gamer girl, Zoe.

31:33.827 --> 31:35.472
- Ready, Frogger?
- I'm ready.

31:35.547 --> 31:37.279
- Here we go.

31:37.754 --> 31:39.992
- Boss Toad Temple,
Zoe. Take it down.

31:40.067 --> 31:41.439
- Love her hair.

31:44.947 --> 31:46.832
Zoe, a Call of Duty player.

31:46.907 --> 31:47.999
She cannot be what they call

31:48.074 --> 31:49.792
a camper and just sit
around the outskirt.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.179
She's gotta go right at it.

31:51.254 --> 31:52.832
And the clock is already
ticking. Harriette the Hippo

31:52.907 --> 31:54.759
taking her for a ride.

31:56.987 --> 31:58.392
Big jump here.

31:58.467 --> 32:02.199
- Oh no, she's down!
Oh, it's all over.

32:02.274 --> 32:04.072
That's an unfortunate ending.

32:04.147 --> 32:06.232
Sparkle and fade.
Zoe Con.

32:06.241 --> 32:08.239
(Boss Toad laughs)

32:09.107 --> 32:10.872
- Oh, she slipped.

32:10.947 --> 32:12.879
Boss Toad Temple a
ruthless course.

32:13.507 --> 32:16.072
- Coach Joe.
Ready, Frogger?

32:16.147 --> 32:17.472
- Ready.
- Here we go.

32:17.547 --> 32:18.519
- Yeah.

32:18.594 --> 32:21.392
Great quads on Coach Joe,
beautiful knees.

32:21.467 --> 32:23.999
Let's go, Joe.
Come on now.

32:24.074 --> 32:25.312
He's going due west, Wayans.

32:25.387 --> 32:28.272
On to Harriette
The Hippo. No problem.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.552
Harriot. No relation
to the famous spy.

32:30.627 --> 32:31.919
- This is decision
making time.

32:31.994 --> 32:33.112
Oh, he set on his belly.

32:33.187 --> 32:34.432
- He looks like
a stunt double.

32:34.507 --> 32:36.192
- Is he going to the temple?
- No.

32:36.267 --> 32:38.872
Wayans is this terrified
of toad temple.

32:38.947 --> 32:40.199
You don't go there.

32:40.274 --> 32:41.752
You go up to the helipad.
We've seen it before.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.032
There is the first froglet
waiting right there.

32:44.107 --> 32:45.719
- Can you slow down, Joe?

32:46.387 --> 32:47.659
- And there's always a photo

32:47.734 --> 32:49.472
op right in the middle
of the helicopter ride.

32:49.547 --> 32:52.392
There it is.
- Coach Joe beautiful triceps.

32:52.467 --> 32:54.679
- Nice.
- Not bad.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.032
- Dang!
- Froglet.

32:57.107 --> 32:58.672
- Tuck that baby right
in there.

32:58.747 --> 33:00.952
- Nicely done.
Swaddled tucked away.

33:00.961 --> 33:03.232
And good night.
Froglet right there.

33:03.307 --> 33:05.232
Will he reach for it?
Absolutely.

33:05.241 --> 33:07.112
All right, coach Joe.

33:07.187 --> 33:09.232
- Joe! Joe!

33:09.307 --> 33:12.152
Ippolito!
Two in.

33:12.227 --> 33:14.032
We are just a minute
and change.

33:14.041 --> 33:15.192
He's doing wonderfully.

33:15.267 --> 33:16.392
We're gonna go
for the third one.

33:16.467 --> 33:18.032
Wayans, in the bottom
right of the screen.

33:18.107 --> 33:19.332
You see the froglet spinning

33:19.407 --> 33:21.312
on the turtle at the
top is to the Temple.

33:21.387 --> 33:23.639
There are two up there,
but it is quite a journey.

33:24.507 --> 33:27.152
- Effortless making
the jumps look so easy.

33:27.227 --> 33:29.392
And I think he
is going turtle.

33:29.401 --> 33:31.552
- Yes, he is.
- The turtle is tough.

33:31.627 --> 33:34.992
He has to first go
Gator then Tommy.

33:35.067 --> 33:37.559
- Yeah, this one calls
for lots of balance.

33:40.707 --> 33:42.832
This is one of the toughest
jumps in all of Toad Temple.

33:42.907 --> 33:44.232
Here the spinning
Tommy turn on.

33:44.307 --> 33:46.472
Look out, his shoe is
untied right now.

33:46.547 --> 33:48.632
- That shoe lace is
scaring me.

33:48.707 --> 33:52.072
- He's not very good
at untying and tying things.

33:52.147 --> 33:55.192
- Here he comes.
- Nice. Got it.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.232
Joe's playing good Frogger.
- I like it.

33:57.241 --> 33:58.912
- If he could put
three on the board.

33:58.987 --> 34:00.339
Three is no joke.

34:00.341 --> 34:02.152
That will put pressure on
Jackson and this is gonna be

34:02.227 --> 34:03.392
a question where
they can finish...

34:03.467 --> 34:05.279
- Oh, no! Froglet down.

34:05.907 --> 34:08.439
- Oh, he's going
out for the frog.

34:08.874 --> 34:10.112
- Okay, now it
is out of reach.

34:10.187 --> 34:11.625
He's gonna have to commit

34:11.701 --> 34:14.639
a lot of time to retrieve that
froglet or just ditch it.

34:16.467 --> 34:19.239
- And he has rescued it.
- I like it.

34:19.867 --> 34:22.512
We're under 20 seconds.
Can I get this thing home?

34:22.587 --> 34:25.272
Three is nothing to sneeze at.

34:25.347 --> 34:26.959
Breathing hard.

34:27.034 --> 34:31.359
Darth Vader esque respiration
from the Darth Ippolito here.

34:32.387 --> 34:35.439
- This is the final
drive to the basket.

34:36.027 --> 34:39.719
Joe Ippolito
for three and it counts.

34:42.107 --> 34:44.639
- That was an
awesome run, man.

34:45.361 --> 34:48.912
- He really put the pressure
on his competitors.

34:48.987 --> 34:50.799
- He is gassed right now.

34:51.507 --> 34:55.032
Our final Frogger is
Jazzy Long Legs himself.

34:55.107 --> 34:56.512
His money makers.

34:56.521 --> 34:58.832
The legs are beat up.
He's playing hurt.

34:58.907 --> 35:00.399
We'll see if that
comes into play.

35:07.587 --> 35:10.032
- Off goes Jazzy Long Legs
on Boss Toad Temple

35:10.041 --> 35:13.392
and he's going
over to the turtle first.

35:13.467 --> 35:16.072
We don't see a lot
of this, Wayans.

35:16.147 --> 35:18.032
- I don't hate that.
- Come back here.

35:18.107 --> 35:19.319
Come back here.
Come on.

35:19.394 --> 35:21.232
Move it up. I ain't got all
day here, Mr. Crocodile.

35:21.241 --> 35:23.272
- He is walking through
these things like

35:23.347 --> 35:25.312
playing hopscotch. What
makes me nervous is these

35:25.387 --> 35:27.392
turtles and these Gators
beat up the knees.

35:27.467 --> 35:29.232
They're heavily textured.

35:29.307 --> 35:31.839
They can really run
across those kneecaps.

35:33.147 --> 35:34.312
- Look at that.

35:34.387 --> 35:35.839
- He didn't even jump to that.

35:38.347 --> 35:39.592
- Come on, Mr. Crocodile,
go fast.

35:39.667 --> 35:41.112
- Remember, he is
on the clock here.

35:41.187 --> 35:42.579
We gotta go here, Jazzy.

35:42.654 --> 35:44.472
- Go now. I would go now.
- Working his way to the tail

35:44.547 --> 35:46.912
to the head, yeah.
- Beautiful.

35:46.987 --> 35:48.112
A little rough again.

35:48.121 --> 35:50.039
The abrasions are
gonna sit in.

35:51.707 --> 35:53.352
Are we going to see a jump
shot from the turtle?

35:53.427 --> 35:55.312
- Is he gonna throw that?
Oh, my gosh.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.759
He's going to throw
this thing.

35:57.521 --> 36:01.192
Jazzy, we got it onto
Giligreens Island.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.312
We've never seen that.

36:02.387 --> 36:04.719
The Denver, Colorado
product channeling

36:04.794 --> 36:09.232
Payton Manning, John Elway
and just an inch to spare.

36:09.241 --> 36:10.799
- Big jump here, let's go.

36:12.827 --> 36:16.439
- Ow! Jazzy goes down hard.

36:17.427 --> 36:19.832
Is he holding himself?
Did he injure his upper body?

36:19.841 --> 36:21.119
- He hurt his little ribs.

36:21.194 --> 36:23.872
Okay, he might have got
hurt on that last jump.

36:23.947 --> 36:25.032
I think he took a shot,
Wayans.

36:25.107 --> 36:27.032
Something in the rib,
the solar plexus.

36:27.107 --> 36:29.799
And he might not be
able to continue.

36:29.874 --> 36:32.239
- Breathe, breathe, breathe!

36:43.267 --> 36:44.719
- Oh my God.

36:47.354 --> 36:48.859
- Unfortunately,

36:48.861 --> 36:51.112
he has taken a tough shot
out there on the course.

36:51.187 --> 36:53.959
- Oh, he hit his chest.
You got it.

36:54.267 --> 36:55.512
- Okay.

36:55.587 --> 36:56.832
He might have got the wind
knocked out of him.

36:56.907 --> 36:59.112
Jazz is clearly playing
hurt upper and lower body.

36:59.187 --> 37:01.112
But, wow, stop him.
- Okay, Jazzy.

37:01.187 --> 37:03.392
- We've seen
Froggers take a shot.

37:03.401 --> 37:05.479
Never like this.
- Wow.

37:06.187 --> 37:07.232
- Okay. Decision time.

37:07.307 --> 37:08.432
He's going helipad.

37:08.507 --> 37:09.939
I don't know what kind

37:10.014 --> 37:11.519
of state he's in right now,
but he was a little shaken.

37:11.594 --> 37:13.112
- I'm in so much
pain right now.

37:13.187 --> 37:15.792
- Jazzy long legs
does not give up.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.632
- I think he also wants
the Fanny pack.

37:17.707 --> 37:18.839
And who can blame him?
- Yeah.

37:18.914 --> 37:20.085
- Might be worth more than

37:20.161 --> 37:21.479
the ten grand when
all said and done.

37:22.234 --> 37:23.912
The second froglet.

37:23.987 --> 37:24.992
Here comes the ride.

37:25.067 --> 37:27.599
He's all business now.
- Go faster!

37:27.867 --> 37:29.719
(all laugh)

37:30.787 --> 37:33.152
- Nice.
- Now he can park froglet one.

37:33.227 --> 37:34.592
And does he go over
and clean up two?

37:34.667 --> 37:36.432
- Yes.
- Thank you so much.

37:36.507 --> 37:37.779
- Two on the board.

37:37.854 --> 37:39.952
He has one to go to catch
Coach Joe.

37:40.027 --> 37:41.352
Two to take the lead.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.312
- And we got
one right there already.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.879
All right, you know, that's
not gonna be a problem.

37:45.954 --> 37:48.272
- Wow, okay.
- He's got three.

37:48.347 --> 37:50.312
Oh, he's gonna toss it.
Does he finish?

37:50.321 --> 37:52.512
He seems to be well ahead
of coach Joe's time.

37:52.587 --> 37:57.512
This will give him the lead.
- Jazzy! Great job.

37:57.587 --> 37:58.672
Great job.

37:58.681 --> 37:59.865
- Unbelievable.

37:59.941 --> 38:02.872
Jazzy Long Legs has
beaten coach Joe's time.

38:02.947 --> 38:03.879
- That's it.

38:03.954 --> 38:06.072
He's going
back in there.

38:06.147 --> 38:07.305
Wayans, have we
ever seen this?

38:07.381 --> 38:09.512
Jackson's showing no
signs of quitting.

38:09.587 --> 38:12.632
It looks like he's going
for the five, Wayans.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.512
Incredible.
- Let's go!

38:14.521 --> 38:18.032
I ain't got all day here!
- No time to waste.

38:18.107 --> 38:19.512
There's only two froglets left

38:19.587 --> 38:21.312
Wayans, and there's just
under two minutes.

38:21.387 --> 38:22.392
- I'm coming for you.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.319
- He's calling out the temple.

38:25.321 --> 38:26.399
Effortless.

38:26.474 --> 38:29.559
We've never seen
a Frogger this frog like.

38:30.627 --> 38:33.672
Remember, we have 1300
gallons per minute

38:33.747 --> 38:36.912
cascading down the Toad
Temple, and he's on.

38:36.987 --> 38:38.759
- Oh! Heavy!

38:39.554 --> 38:41.072
- That is froglet number four.

38:41.081 --> 38:42.472
If he can park that one,

38:42.547 --> 38:45.432
he can slam dunk
this thing home.

38:45.507 --> 38:46.832
The clock is ticking.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.199
He has got under
a minute left.

38:48.274 --> 38:49.712
There's another froglet,
Wayans.

38:49.787 --> 38:52.319
He could get both
of them home for five.

38:53.227 --> 38:55.192
Let's go, Jackson.

38:55.267 --> 38:58.872
Let's go, Jackson.
Down we go.

38:58.947 --> 39:00.912
Look out on your 6th, Jackson,

39:00.987 --> 39:04.072
Here comes the ball!
He dodges it.

39:04.147 --> 39:05.152
Okay,

39:05.227 --> 39:06.712
now we have a race
against the clock.

39:06.787 --> 39:09.352
A matter of seconds left.
He's gotta go.

39:09.427 --> 39:11.592
Gotta go. Home stretch.
Don't hesitate.

39:11.667 --> 39:12.759
- Jazzy!

39:12.834 --> 39:14.072
He's gonna throw him.

39:14.147 --> 39:15.952
Only seconds left, Wayans.

39:15.961 --> 39:17.039
- Oh, my gosh.

39:17.114 --> 39:19.032
- Ten.
- A two buzzer beater.

39:19.107 --> 39:23.279
- 8, 7, 6, 5...

39:23.354 --> 39:26.039
- Park them! Jazzy Long Legs!

39:26.114 --> 39:27.512
Oh, my goodness.

39:27.587 --> 39:30.192
Jackson has gone
five for five!

39:30.267 --> 39:31.519
I can't believe it!

39:32.027 --> 39:33.712
- I'm about to start crying.

39:33.721 --> 39:35.552
- All that Jazz!

39:35.627 --> 39:36.679
- Wow!

39:36.754 --> 39:38.512
- Oh, my God.

39:38.521 --> 39:40.439
- Oh, my God.

39:40.987 --> 39:43.472
Shock and awe on
Boss Toad Temple!

39:43.547 --> 39:46.239
I just conquered the
Boss Toad round!

39:47.267 --> 39:49.552
- All Five Jazzy Long Legend.

39:49.627 --> 39:51.879
- And still posing.
We love this man.

39:53.081 --> 39:54.192
- Congratulations, Jackson.

39:54.267 --> 39:56.879
The Golden Fanny
Pack is yours.

39:57.881 --> 40:01.312
And so is the $10,000 in cash.

40:01.321 --> 40:03.159
We cannot wait to see Jackson

40:03.234 --> 40:05.072
in the ultimate
Frogger Championship where

40:05.081 --> 40:07.552
this guy is gonna
play for 100 grand.

40:07.627 --> 40:10.432
Dude, you see what's trending
worldwide right now?

40:10.507 --> 40:11.885
- Yeah.

40:11.961 --> 40:15.152
- Jazzy Long Legs.
- Hashtag, JazzyLongLegs, baby.

40:15.227 --> 40:16.319
- Jazz!
(laughs)
