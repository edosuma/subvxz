WEBVTT

00:02.618 --> 00:05.929
What do you even do here?
Sit on your ass and analyze data?

00:06.049 --> 00:09.481
I'm a field agent, Isaac Newton,
I risk my life, so yeah...

00:09.601 --> 00:12.293
I do deserve the best space
in the parking garage.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.315
Like it would kill you to roll 50 feet.

00:14.435 --> 00:15.872
Stupid thing's electric.

00:15.992 --> 00:19.160
Archer, I still haven't got those
TNE reports you promised.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.071
Are you sure? You didn't eat them?

00:21.191 --> 00:24.555
Yeah, well, since Lana broke up with me
I've been finding solace in food.

00:24.675 --> 00:28.206
Well, keep your chins up Cyril.
All eleven of them.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.798
Cyril's about half a rack, huh?

00:30.918 --> 00:32.482
Yeah, so why do you pick on him?

00:32.601 --> 00:34.596
I, oh, was that a rhetorical?

00:34.716 --> 00:36.116
And why are you
bleaching everything?

00:36.184 --> 00:38.937
Ugh... because it
sneezed out here!

00:38.975 --> 00:39.820
Okay.

00:39.888 --> 00:40.687
And is mother in?

00:40.755 --> 00:44.014
- Oh, she's in there, all right,
- And they're expecting you.

00:44.134 --> 00:45.514
Thanks, crazy.

00:45.634 --> 00:46.391
Who's they?

00:46.511 --> 00:47.919
Hello, Archer.

00:48.039 --> 00:48.862
Trinette?!

00:48.982 --> 00:49.961
Why are you here?

00:50.081 --> 00:53.100
You don't call me for a year,
and that's how you talk to me?!

00:53.167 --> 00:54.034
Yes, dear.

00:54.102 --> 00:55.335
Where are your manners?

00:55.403 --> 00:56.003
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:56.070 --> 00:58.138
I guess I skipped the Emily post
chapter about how to introduce

00:58.206 --> 01:00.040
your mother to a hooker!

01:00.108 --> 01:01.341
Escort! Ya puke.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.510
And I'm retired.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.377
Yeah?

01:03.444 --> 01:04.378
Your 401k doing that well?

01:04.444 --> 01:06.079
I have a sep, smartass!

01:06.147 --> 01:07.014
Oh, and this.

01:07.081 --> 01:10.017
So I ain't worried about gettin' by.

01:10.084 --> 01:11.852
What is... Why, is
this a subpoena?

01:11.920 --> 01:13.120
It's for the paternity test.

01:13.187 --> 01:13.887
The what?!

01:13.955 --> 01:17.081
Yes, "the what," dear...
And "the who."

01:17.201 --> 01:18.709
What who?!
Who is that?!

01:18.829 --> 01:20.694
Why, this is Seamus
McGoon Sterling.

01:20.762 --> 01:23.897
No, Seamus Sterling McGoon Archer.

01:23.965 --> 01:25.949
And why is that "who"
named like me?!

01:26.069 --> 01:27.251
Why do ya think?

01:27.371 --> 01:28.535
I'm asking you why!

01:28.603 --> 01:30.312
Because he's your son.

01:30.432 --> 01:33.454
You colossal idiot.

02:10.638 --> 02:11.472
Why?

02:11.592 --> 02:15.110
Why didn't you just get the vasectomy
like I ask you to?

02:15.230 --> 02:18.091
- Honestly, I thought it would hurt.
- And this doesn't?

02:18.211 --> 02:19.687
- It-it's apples and oranges.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.528
- I'm not ready to be a grandmother.
- Really? But you're so...

02:22.648 --> 02:24.004
Grandmother-ly?

02:24.124 --> 02:25.509
No... Old.

02:25.629 --> 02:27.990
If and when I am ready for a grandchild

02:28.110 --> 02:30.197
it won't be the potato face spawn

02:30.317 --> 02:32.765
- of some Irish whore!
- Exactly. It's probably not!

02:32.885 --> 02:34.132
I mean, seriously, what're
the odds on that?

02:34.200 --> 02:36.034
- So she had a lot of... Ugh...
- You kidding?

02:36.102 --> 02:38.303
I used to have to book
her weeks in advance.

02:38.371 --> 02:40.572
- Although...
- Although what?

02:40.639 --> 02:42.221
Um... whew!

02:42.741 --> 02:44.777
Wow, Trinette, that was amazing.

02:44.897 --> 02:46.711
Yeah, that... Wh-?!

02:46.779 --> 02:48.112
Wait a minute!

02:49.047 --> 02:49.347
You liar!

02:49.414 --> 02:53.151
This ain't a condom wrapper,
it's from a frickin' candy bar!

02:53.218 --> 02:55.186
So? Sometimes
I like to treat myself.

02:55.254 --> 02:57.674
Well, sometimes I like to ovulate!

02:57.794 --> 02:59.991
Well, I gotta sleep, so
do it somewhere else.

03:00.058 --> 03:01.225
Money's on the dresser.

03:01.293 --> 03:02.026
Nothing.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.315
Hundred-to-one, he's mine.

03:03.435 --> 03:04.893
Well, he better not be!

03:05.013 --> 03:07.665
My God, I couldn't bear the
shame it would bring on this

03:07.733 --> 03:09.367
- family to have... um...
- No.

03:09.434 --> 03:11.135
Please, mother,
finish that thought!

03:11.203 --> 03:13.204
Oh my God, you're
such a hypocrite!

03:13.272 --> 03:15.072
You were gonna say
"illegitimate child"!

03:15.140 --> 03:18.009
No, I was going to say "bastard."

03:18.076 --> 03:19.388
Ouch.

03:19.508 --> 03:21.442
I mean, that's gotta hurt, huh?

03:21.510 --> 03:23.944
Why should I care if Archer
knocked up some dumb hooker?

03:24.012 --> 03:27.148
Because babies are soft-skulled, fat
little germsacks, and now we've all

03:27.206 --> 03:29.269
been exposed to that
one's bacteria!

03:29.389 --> 03:30.418
What?

03:30.486 --> 03:31.573
Don't engage her.

03:31.693 --> 03:34.489
But c'mon, Lana, you dated Mr. Archer
forever and...

03:34.556 --> 03:36.691
And you have nothing
to show for it.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.107
Paging doctor Loggins.

03:38.227 --> 03:41.572
Couple things... One, I don't need
a baby to validate my existence.

03:41.692 --> 03:45.533
Two, the absolute last person
on earth I'd have a baby with

03:45.653 --> 03:48.558
is Archer, because he
is not sold separately.

03:48.678 --> 03:52.643
Did you try...
Yeah, I'll come over, mother.

03:52.763 --> 03:54.436
Just gimme... 20 minutes.

03:56.014 --> 03:56.914
Well, I'm sorry, Lana!

03:56.982 --> 03:59.083
But I didn't invent the
childproof pill bottle!

03:59.151 --> 04:02.453
So as far as Archer's concerned, I actually
feel like I dodged the world's most

04:02.521 --> 04:03.759
dysfunctional bullet.

04:03.879 --> 04:06.407
Yeah, but Cyril was...
Oh, wait!

04:06.527 --> 04:08.764
Did he have some sort
of character flaw?

04:08.884 --> 04:11.700
Hello, hello, hello!

04:13.322 --> 04:15.867
Couple things...

04:16.535 --> 04:19.470
- Yeah, we are code blue here...
- Hey, yeah, blue!

04:19.538 --> 04:20.805
Like for baby boys!

04:20.872 --> 04:24.108
- No, I meant like for her face, but...
- No, like for let's have a

04:24.176 --> 04:27.478
baby shower for Trinette
and the wee baby Seamus!

04:27.546 --> 04:28.479
Oh, my God, yes.

04:28.547 --> 04:30.934
But you're place is disgusting,
so where can we have it?

04:31.054 --> 04:33.926
Well, Archer's got
that bangin' pad.

04:33.951 --> 04:35.349
Ooh, he'll hate that!

04:35.469 --> 04:36.520
I wanna come!

04:36.521 --> 04:39.144
Ooh, I think I just did...

04:39.700 --> 04:41.839
And, so, thank you both for coming.

04:41.959 --> 04:45.310
Even though, Mr. Archer is the only
party named in the subpoena.

04:45.348 --> 04:47.385
Well, we both have
invested interest

04:47.423 --> 04:49.007
in the outcome of this silly test.

04:49.127 --> 04:52.503
And said test will, obviously, be
administered by a third party, so...

04:52.571 --> 04:53.905
A third party?!

04:53.947 --> 04:56.474
But we have a state-of-the-art
laboratory at ISIS!

04:58.084 --> 05:01.762
Normally, I wouldn't let an intern
do this on his first day but...

05:02.316 --> 05:04.205
Chet?

05:04.325 --> 05:05.792
How's it hanging, buddy?

05:05.865 --> 05:06.852
I'm sure you do.

05:06.892 --> 05:09.973
But our client has concerns
about the integrity of the test results,

05:10.093 --> 05:14.287
given your agency's...
clandestine nature.

05:14.407 --> 05:18.809
Oh, and by the way, super-crazy about
that elevator pretending it's a dryer.

05:18.934 --> 05:19.735
Barry?

05:19.785 --> 05:23.968
But all kidding aside, ODIN will be
providing security for the paternity test.

05:23.969 --> 05:25.220
- Odin?!
- Oh, yeah.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.204
Hello, Archer.

05:26.324 --> 05:26.874
Barry.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.110
- How's it hanging, buddy?
- Hanging great, Barry.

05:29.230 --> 05:29.908
How's the leg?

05:30.424 --> 05:32.310
Barry, does it hurt?

05:33.227 --> 05:35.317
Cause it looks like
it kinda hurts.

05:35.906 --> 05:40.207
It did hurt, and it still does, so...
So how can Trinette afford ODIN?!

05:40.327 --> 05:41.774
This is pro Bono.

05:41.894 --> 05:44.577
Consider it payback for
my shattered femur.

05:44.697 --> 05:46.779
And that reminds me... doctor Ben?

05:46.891 --> 05:49.216
Wh-?!
And what the hell is this?!

05:49.336 --> 05:52.932
We take a blood sample from Archer...
My God?

05:53.052 --> 05:54.549
What year is this?!
I know, right?!

05:54.669 --> 05:56.493
Why can't you just
take a DNA swab?!

05:56.553 --> 05:59.188
A blood sample is enough
to determine paternity.

05:59.256 --> 06:01.157
And after we take a liter...
A liter?!

06:01.224 --> 06:02.057
How much is a... Owww!

06:02.125 --> 06:05.528
Archer will be left in a weakened state,
which should prevent his attempting to

06:05.595 --> 06:07.029
compromise the test.

06:07.097 --> 06:09.832
Turtlenecks, I invented those.

06:09.900 --> 06:10.533
You're bleeding him dry!

06:10.600 --> 06:12.568
Ser'sly, Barry, how
much is a liter?

06:12.636 --> 06:13.469
About 8 gills.

06:13.537 --> 06:17.339
What's a gill? You're just talkin' in circles.
Thanks doctor Ben.

06:17.407 --> 06:18.013
Next!

06:18.133 --> 06:22.344
Under ODIN guard, the sample is taken
to the vault of First Savings Bank.

06:22.464 --> 06:25.395
I don't know why I told you where,
but it doesn't matter, as the

06:25.515 --> 06:28.217
bank and vault will be
surrounded by ODIN agents.

06:28.285 --> 06:31.520
Merely an added precaution, as
the vault is basically one big

06:31.588 --> 06:34.456
shitstorm of
anti-intrusion devices.

06:34.524 --> 06:38.948
Tomorrow, in full view of both
parties, we will test the sample

06:39.068 --> 06:42.311
here, along with a blood sample
from wee baby Seamus, thus

06:42.431 --> 06:45.818
ensuring complete accuracy
of the paternity test.

06:45.890 --> 06:46.824
Any questions?

06:46.891 --> 06:50.861
Yeah, Barry...
I'm still unclear on the liter thing?

06:50.929 --> 06:53.426
Vis-a-vis, uh, unit of volume

06:59.197 --> 07:01.076
I seriously don't
feel good at all.

07:01.196 --> 07:04.573
That's because those ODIN ghouls
drained a fifth of your blood.

07:04.641 --> 07:07.376
Oh hey, speaking of fifth...
A drink's the last thing you need!

07:07.444 --> 07:12.081
Well, you might want one too, cause...
Pretty decent chance the baby's mine.

07:12.148 --> 07:13.315
What?!

07:13.383 --> 07:14.983
What happened to a
hundred-to-one?!

07:15.051 --> 07:18.020
I may have uh,
massaged that number.

07:18.088 --> 07:21.056
How can I show my face around
town if... Trudy Beekman

07:21.124 --> 07:22.524
will eat me alive for this!

07:22.592 --> 07:23.158
Decent chance.

07:23.226 --> 07:26.497
Oh, oh, oh, and I can just forget all
about getting on the board at the met!

07:27.797 --> 07:28.664
The museum or the opera?

07:28.732 --> 07:29.398
Either!

07:29.466 --> 07:35.571
Sterling Malory Archer, you...
are going to break in that vault

07:35.638 --> 07:38.407
and replace your blood
with someone else's!

07:38.475 --> 07:39.408
Someone else's blood.

07:39.476 --> 07:43.345
Yeah, great, I'll just have Igor
bring a villager up to my castle.

07:43.413 --> 07:44.079
Oh, Igor!

07:44.147 --> 07:45.514
Yeesss?

07:45.582 --> 07:46.812
Oh, evening sir.

07:46.932 --> 07:47.616
Hello, mum!

07:47.684 --> 07:49.218
Woodhouse, what the hell is this?!

07:49.285 --> 07:50.919
It's a baby shower!

07:50.987 --> 07:53.188
What's it look like, ya puke?

07:53.256 --> 07:53.722
Ugh.

07:53.790 --> 07:55.334
I think I could use a drink.

07:55.454 --> 07:56.681
Sterling?

07:56.732 --> 07:57.501
Pick a villager.

07:57.569 --> 07:59.716
Why did you let them in my house?!

08:00.205 --> 08:02.755
Because I told you to buy
lemon curd, Woodhouse!

08:02.875 --> 08:05.276
Now what am I gonna
spread on my toast?

08:05.343 --> 08:06.506
Your tears?!

08:06.626 --> 08:10.681
They just sort of barged in, sir...
Uh-huh.

08:10.749 --> 08:12.315
And why are you barefoot?!

08:12.435 --> 08:15.018
Oh, you guys, it's so sweet.

08:15.117 --> 08:16.654
I made that!

08:16.721 --> 08:20.191
It was gonna be a ham cozy,
but then I was like "eh."

08:20.258 --> 08:20.824
So.

08:20.892 --> 08:22.760
Well, he can use it as a blankie.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.761
And... eww.

08:23.828 --> 08:25.696
What is this, homemade
salad dressing?

08:25.764 --> 08:27.398
Breast milk.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.433
I have my own.

08:29.501 --> 08:31.168
So you won't need this.

08:31.236 --> 08:34.238
It's some plastic
dry cleaner bags.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.640
Oh, and a book about SIDS.

08:36.707 --> 08:37.174
Wh-?!

08:37.241 --> 08:38.876
What kinda shit gift is that?!

08:38.943 --> 08:40.110
Yeah, right?

08:40.178 --> 08:41.544
I made mine.

08:41.613 --> 08:42.246
Me too!

08:42.313 --> 08:43.246
That's disgusting.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.617
If I wanted to look at your bare
feet, I'd sneak in and

08:46.685 --> 08:47.799
do it while you were asleep!

08:48.351 --> 08:49.119
Well?

08:49.187 --> 08:50.254
Have you picked out a donor?

08:50.322 --> 08:50.721
Yeah.

08:50.789 --> 08:53.591
I dunno if it's the blood loss or
what, but this whole thing feels...

08:53.658 --> 08:54.846
Pretty stupid, Archer.

08:54.966 --> 08:56.594
Getting a hooker pregnant?

08:56.661 --> 08:57.261
Yikes.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.263
Cyril...
Oh, sorry, Ms. Archer.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.799
I'm sure the board at the
met will frown on this.

09:01.866 --> 09:04.001
I'm sure I don't
care for your tone.

09:04.069 --> 09:09.599
Well, I don't care to be judged by a couple of...
Lousy hooker-baby havers!

09:10.642 --> 09:11.175
You were saying?

09:11.243 --> 09:14.245
You get him drunk, I'll go to the
drugstore and get some supplies.

09:14.312 --> 09:17.982
But you said I could hold him you've
been holding him and you've been drinking

09:18.049 --> 09:20.551
and yer hands are so damn big!

09:20.619 --> 09:22.286
Don't wantcha to, um, crush him.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.456
No, but I'm gentle, I'm soft,
give her the rabbit, Lenny.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.290
Okay.

09:26.358 --> 09:30.227
Thank... Wow, somebody's
got a full diaper, huh?

09:30.295 --> 09:31.128
Ugh.

09:31.196 --> 09:35.132
And after that falafel, I am right behind him...
Did you see me?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.034
Holding the baby?

09:37.102 --> 09:38.936
Looked like Tyson
holding that dove.

09:39.004 --> 09:40.019
Listen, bitch... Ah!

09:40.139 --> 09:42.706
Careful, 'cause, in about three
drinks, you're gonna get all

09:42.774 --> 09:45.342
boohooey, ask me to
pump a baby into you.

09:45.410 --> 09:45.776
Wh-?!

09:45.844 --> 09:48.312
No, you guys should
totally do that!

09:48.380 --> 09:50.714
The mochachino ones
are the cutest!

09:50.782 --> 09:56.353
Guess he'd be half-gay too, though...
So can you say best dancer ever?!

09:56.421 --> 09:56.820
No!

09:56.888 --> 09:59.323
Thank you, but I
don't care for any!

09:59.391 --> 10:01.125
Cyril, it's a toast.

10:01.192 --> 10:02.359
Don't be rude.
No!

10:02.427 --> 10:06.597
Alcohol tends to exacerbate an underlying...
Personality disorder!

10:06.665 --> 10:09.366
Sexual addiction's not
a real thing, asshole!

10:09.434 --> 10:12.303
Well, just wait'll the
new DSM comes out!

10:12.370 --> 10:13.124
Then we'll see!

10:13.244 --> 10:15.339
We'll see you still
being an asshole!

10:15.407 --> 10:18.309
So, uh... have you ever
thought about having a baby?

10:18.376 --> 10:18.709
I dunno.

10:18.777 --> 10:22.046
Sometimes I think, ya know, I'd
like to adopt a little baby...

10:22.113 --> 10:23.920
So I could abandon
it at the mall.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.524
That answers my
follow-up question.

10:28.644 --> 10:30.462
Cyril, you're insulting me.

10:30.582 --> 10:33.123
A toast!
And what is it to toast about about, anyway?!

10:33.191 --> 10:34.358
How bout that "upper decker"

10:34.426 --> 10:37.115
I just left in the master bath?

10:38.229 --> 10:41.565
C'mon, Ray.
Sploosh, called it, three drinks ago.

10:41.633 --> 10:48.038
C'mon, we both have amazing genes...
Nobody's arguing we're both hot, but...

10:48.106 --> 10:49.406
Ray, you can do it!

10:49.474 --> 10:51.909
And I can watch!

10:51.976 --> 10:52.676
The door.

10:52.744 --> 10:57.247
Like a lookout, so nobody
sees ya doin' the dirt.

10:57.315 --> 11:00.417
Oh, and also here's
to child support!

11:00.485 --> 11:01.452
See ya around, Cyril.

11:01.519 --> 11:06.190
And I'll see you at the
lawyer's office, granny.

11:06.257 --> 11:07.224
Toast, damn you!

11:07.292 --> 11:08.058
No!

11:08.126 --> 11:08.592
Toast!

11:08.660 --> 11:09.693
Jeezy petes, with you people!

11:09.761 --> 11:11.395
Well, at least I'm
not a sex addict!

11:11.463 --> 11:13.464
And cue the collective
sigh of relief.

11:13.531 --> 11:14.398
Oh, shut up.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.401
Hey, I just ran all the way
to the drugstore a liter low

11:17.469 --> 11:19.737
on blood, so I am in no mood.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.405
Oh, and I am?

11:21.473 --> 11:26.443
Cyril won't drink, so we'll have to
find another way to... Woodhouse, dear?

11:26.511 --> 11:27.177
Yes, mum?

11:27.245 --> 11:28.445
I assume you're holding?

11:28.513 --> 11:29.413
Holding?

11:29.481 --> 11:33.250
Er, why, just this tray of...
Don't bullshit me, you old dope fiend!

11:33.318 --> 11:36.086
After that scrape I
got you out of?!

11:36.154 --> 11:40.424
Let's liven things up, Burroughs...
Five grams of junk says I can

11:40.492 --> 11:43.794
shoot a piña colada
off your wife's head!

11:43.862 --> 11:48.132
100,000 thousand pesos in bribes, and
my stomach's never been the same!

11:48.199 --> 11:51.235
I shall fetch my gear...
What the hell was that?!

11:51.302 --> 11:51.802
Who knows?

11:51.870 --> 11:55.105
I didn't have a sip of water the
entire time I was down there.

11:55.173 --> 11:55.639
No!

11:55.707 --> 11:57.708
Maybe it was an ice cube...
Woodhouse!

11:57.776 --> 11:58.642
He's a heroin addict?!

11:58.710 --> 12:01.245
Oh, listen to you, mister judgy!

12:01.312 --> 12:05.449
Now, go lure Cyril into the bathroom
so we can drain his stupid blood.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.451
Cyril, you are not to blame.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.254
You are merely a victim
of sexual addiction.

12:10.321 --> 12:11.321
Cyril, you are not to blame.

12:11.389 --> 12:13.242
Preaching to the choir, buddy.

12:13.362 --> 12:14.402
And what's that supposed to mean?!

12:14.522 --> 12:18.676
It means, I understand, because I,
too, suffer from sexual addiction.

12:18.796 --> 12:20.931
Oh, you're just a,
dirty stomp-around.

12:20.999 --> 12:22.602
That's what society calls it!

12:22.722 --> 12:26.136
But you know how it is to
be surrounded... by women!

12:26.204 --> 12:26.804
Yes!

12:26.871 --> 12:29.907
Prancing around in their... stirrup pants.

12:29.974 --> 12:31.298
Crotchless panties.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.810
I didn't know they had those.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.478
Pretty sexy.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.013
I have to take care of something!

12:36.080 --> 12:37.848
Medicine cabinet, Cyril, top left!

12:37.916 --> 12:40.150
Big bottle of coconut suntan oil!

12:40.218 --> 12:44.121
Man, I probably shouldn't be
drinking this low on blood.

12:44.189 --> 12:48.992
Whur you doona me...?

12:49.060 --> 12:51.067
I brained him with
the absinthe bottle.

12:51.187 --> 12:51.966
Why?

12:52.086 --> 12:55.332
What was I to do, say "take a load off
while we pump you full of heroin"?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.301
But if he was already knocked out...?!

12:57.368 --> 13:01.271
Dear God, that was
my entire stash!

13:01.339 --> 13:05.142
Going to be an itchy weekend...
Serves you right, smacky brown.

13:05.210 --> 13:07.244
God, how are you even still alive?

13:07.312 --> 13:09.413
Holy shit, how am I still alive?!

13:09.481 --> 13:11.482
Eight gills is way
more than I thought.

13:11.549 --> 13:13.042
That's why you're so woozy.

13:13.162 --> 13:14.785
Yeah, that, plus all
those melon balls.

13:14.853 --> 13:15.919
Had about nine of them.

13:15.987 --> 13:17.688
Why the hell were you drinking?!

13:17.755 --> 13:18.489
Uh, hello?!

13:18.556 --> 13:19.490
It's a party?!

13:19.557 --> 13:20.858
It's a baby shower!

13:20.925 --> 13:24.828
For the bastard child you
humped into a filthy whore!

13:24.896 --> 13:27.764
So... I'm obviously not
saying now, but one of these

13:27.832 --> 13:31.692
days, you are gonna make
just the best grandma ever.

13:36.222 --> 13:40.385
Oh my God... These ODIN dicks...
Hey, where'd ya get your turtleneck?

13:40.505 --> 13:42.480
The turtleneck store?

13:44.376 --> 13:46.315
Wow, definitely
missing that blood.

13:46.445 --> 13:49.748
But maybe if I drank some of Cyril's
blood, I'd... Wait, what am I saying?

13:49.815 --> 13:51.361
I don't even know his blood type.

13:53.853 --> 13:57.922
But I do know a liter of melon balls
can't replace a liter of blood.

13:57.990 --> 14:00.896
Because I'm... kinda
drunk for this oh nuts.

14:12.668 --> 14:14.005
Fantastic.
What.

14:14.073 --> 14:14.773
What're ya doin?

14:14.840 --> 14:17.742
Oh, ya know, just...
Livin the dream Lana.

14:17.810 --> 14:18.743
Yeah?

14:18.811 --> 14:20.578
Well, I'm goin through yer stuff.

14:20.646 --> 14:21.784
Why are you still in my house?!

14:21.904 --> 14:25.144
Eh, there's still a few stragglers here,
tryna keep the party goin...

14:26.269 --> 14:28.749
Cyril. Hey, you awake?

14:29.365 --> 14:32.539
Cause this is about to get weird.

14:32.858 --> 14:33.858
Ants!

14:33.926 --> 14:35.260
Oh! Oh!

14:35.327 --> 14:40.231
So shut up and help me find the nutmeg,
and I'll make you some Malcolm x tea!

14:40.299 --> 14:42.934
And ya know what's frickin lame?

14:43.002 --> 14:45.036
Phased-plasma laser
countermeasures?

14:45.104 --> 14:48.139
No, what's lame is you told
me a jillion times

14:48.207 --> 14:51.709
ya never wanted kids, so I move on with
my life, and then bam...

14:51.777 --> 14:53.641
you drill one into a hooker.

14:53.761 --> 14:55.513
Uh, it wasn't exactly
planned, Lana.

14:55.581 --> 14:56.214
Shut up.

14:56.282 --> 14:59.553
But didja ever think about you
and me, ya know, having a baby?

14:59.673 --> 15:03.788
No, not... I mean, maybe that one time,
when we had that little scare... Wh-?!

15:03.856 --> 15:05.757
Is that a frickin candy bar?!

15:05.825 --> 15:08.593
Yeah, but think you
need the calories?

15:08.661 --> 15:09.794
You are such a prick.

15:09.862 --> 15:12.564
Who dragged out all
this old crap?!

15:12.631 --> 15:16.334
Why are you and mother in my
room, going through my things?!

15:16.402 --> 15:19.137
Because I'll save you some time...
My diary's

15:19.205 --> 15:23.808
by the Barbie playhouse, and the key's
in a locket on Mr. Teddy!

15:23.876 --> 15:29.714
My God, I haven't seen this junk in...
Look at that, his little baby shoes.

15:29.782 --> 15:31.983
Can not picture him as a baby.
Ya know?

15:32.051 --> 15:34.085
I just see an adult him, but tiny.

15:34.153 --> 15:37.006
Like a little Archer G.I. Joe.

15:38.257 --> 15:39.824
You... want me to freshen that up?

15:39.892 --> 15:40.851
Mm... Try not to drown it.

15:42.728 --> 15:46.601
Aww, his little christening gown...
Pam!

15:46.721 --> 15:47.775
You... Get off Cyril!

15:47.895 --> 15:49.785
I was tryin to get him off!

15:49.905 --> 15:51.030
***

15:51.150 --> 15:52.791
Out!
Out, just get straight on out!

15:52.911 --> 15:53.909
Aw, c'mon!

15:54.029 --> 15:55.306
Cyril came on to me!

15:55.374 --> 15:56.040
Oh shut up!

15:56.108 --> 15:57.842
He's totally passed out!

15:57.910 --> 16:03.381
Really... Hey, Cyril.
How's it hanging, buddy?

16:03.449 --> 16:07.318
His first pair of lacrosse cleats...
His first

16:07.386 --> 16:12.156
smoking jacket... and, oh my...
His first black turtleneck!

16:12.224 --> 16:14.125
I can't believe Lana and mother.

16:14.193 --> 16:17.376
No respect for people's privacy.

16:19.298 --> 16:20.798
White ass daddy!

16:20.866 --> 16:21.833
Shit's tight, huh?

16:21.901 --> 16:22.901
Yo... Where you at, mama?

16:22.968 --> 16:25.003
And why're you calling
me right now?!

16:25.070 --> 16:27.805
I had to, before it's too late!
I... What?!

16:27.873 --> 16:29.748
I don't want you to do it, Sterling!
What?

16:29.868 --> 16:32.239
I know you didn't plan on
this baby, but Sterling,

16:32.359 --> 16:35.680
sometimes the unexpected things
can turn out to be the most

16:35.748 --> 16:38.707
important things in
the whole world!

16:39.385 --> 16:41.252
Wow, you sound shitfaced.

16:41.320 --> 16:41.986
Oh, listen to you!

16:42.054 --> 16:43.388
Mr. melon balls!

16:43.455 --> 16:46.013
And the yes, maybe I've had a few.

16:46.133 --> 16:49.635
And even though I was
not always mother of the year,

16:49.755 --> 16:51.121
I can change!

16:51.241 --> 16:53.798
And you can change, and maybe
together we could

16:53.866 --> 16:56.601
add up to one good parent
for this baby..

16:56.669 --> 17:00.538
But I'm, like, right here...
And I'm right here... for both of you.

17:00.606 --> 17:02.700
Mother, I'm not sure I'm ready.

17:02.820 --> 17:05.522
Sterling, no one's ever sure
they're ready for a child.

17:05.643 --> 17:09.449
That's why it's scary, and
that's why it's so special.

17:10.182 --> 17:13.917
So, please, dear,
do the right thing.

17:13.986 --> 17:17.751
God, the one time in my life she acts
like a human being, and it's now?

17:17.871 --> 17:19.811
Was it when I wanted a puppy?
No!

17:19.932 --> 17:22.126
Was it when I wanted cornrows?
No!

17:22.194 --> 17:25.262
But maybe she's right...
I mean, the kid's cool, and I'm

17:25.330 --> 17:28.575
obviously awesome, so...
Maybe I would be a good father.

17:30.869 --> 17:33.373
Ya know, at some
point in the future.

17:35.407 --> 17:36.808
Waaaagh!

17:36.875 --> 17:37.642
Waaaagh!

17:37.710 --> 17:38.810
Aww, you're okay, taterhead.

17:38.877 --> 17:40.378
They only took a
little bit of blood.

17:40.446 --> 17:41.813
Yeah, quit being such a baby.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.015
You quit bein such a baby!

17:44.083 --> 17:44.749
You prick!

17:44.817 --> 17:45.483
Shut up!

17:45.551 --> 17:46.818
They took a liter from me!

17:46.885 --> 17:49.654
And as the 24 hours of
uninterrupted vault footage

17:49.722 --> 17:53.791
shows, said liter was never...
except for those nine frames of

17:53.859 --> 17:56.828
static there... out of
sight of ODIN personnel.

17:56.895 --> 17:58.705
We get it.
Let's move on, Barry.

17:58.825 --> 18:01.332
And since you all witnessed
the blood sample being taken

18:01.400 --> 18:04.102
from the wee baby Seamus...
I hereby cede

18:04.169 --> 18:07.672
any and all rights to ever contest the
results of this paternity test.

18:07.740 --> 18:09.062
Move on, Barry!

18:09.182 --> 18:13.810
And, so, said test results conclude...
Exciting, isn't it?

18:13.930 --> 18:17.897
Not really, because it's gonna say...
that Archer is, in fact, the father!

18:18.017 --> 18:18.549
What?!

18:18.617 --> 18:19.384
Wait a minute!

18:19.451 --> 18:24.380
No, that's... Probably the most expensive
candy bar you ever ate, ya dunce!

18:24.500 --> 18:26.406
Really super expensive.

18:26.526 --> 18:28.914
That's a schedule for
child support payments?

18:28.949 --> 18:30.883
First of the month
works best for us.

18:30.951 --> 18:31.517
No, wait!

18:31.585 --> 18:32.431
Somebody coulda
broken in the vault!

18:32.551 --> 18:35.455
C'mon, nine frames is... a glitch!

18:35.522 --> 18:38.285
Because even if somebody did
break into that vault, no one...

18:38.405 --> 18:40.328
No one, Archer...
could ever prove it.

18:40.448 --> 18:42.012
But...
And who'd even want to?

18:42.132 --> 18:44.123
Not a handsome, blond,
cripple like me.

18:44.243 --> 18:45.832
So, kudos, buddy!

18:45.899 --> 18:48.678
Let's go drink some kudos!
Yeah, let's do that!

18:48.679 --> 18:49.882
Clink, clink!

18:51.241 --> 18:52.659
I don't understand
how this happened.

18:52.779 --> 18:56.055
Well, from what I can tell,
it had something to do with

18:56.175 --> 18:59.387
disgustingly kinky sex and a
candy bar, but...

18:59.507 --> 19:01.099
A candy bar?
Mother!

19:01.219 --> 19:03.703
I am not the father. It was...
Cyril?

19:03.823 --> 19:05.627
That thing is huge.

19:05.747 --> 19:11.270
I mean how did you even get... you
sonuva snack-eatin-ass bitch!

19:11.390 --> 19:12.558
I'm sorry!

19:12.626 --> 19:14.956
How can you cheat
on Lana bareback?!

19:15.076 --> 19:16.562
I'm a sex addict!

19:16.630 --> 19:18.564
That's not even a real thing!

19:18.632 --> 19:21.934
And the guilt from sex makes me
binge, then I feel fat,

19:22.002 --> 19:26.516
then I turn to sex to feel attractive again,
then it's just this vicious cycle!

19:27.096 --> 19:28.214
Shitass.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.205
Don't you see?!

19:29.325 --> 19:30.890
The wee baby Seamus is Cyril's!

19:31.010 --> 19:32.715
And Barry just wanted to frame me!

19:32.835 --> 19:34.003
You don't fool me.

19:34.123 --> 19:36.645
You had the chance to make the
switch, but you couldn't.

19:36.765 --> 19:38.451
No, yes I could!

19:38.519 --> 19:41.474
And I never thought I'd say this, but Sterling...
You did the right thing.

19:41.594 --> 19:43.322
No! I didn't!

19:43.390 --> 19:45.725
Well, the thing I thought was
right, but not, ya know,

19:45.793 --> 19:47.326
what people think is right!

19:47.394 --> 19:48.728
Well, maybe you're
turning into people.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.563
But I don't wanna be people!

19:50.631 --> 19:52.072
And I didn't want to
be a grandmother.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.432
But c'est la vie, dear.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.909
Yeah, and c'est la child support!

19:55.029 --> 19:57.230
Well, just tighten your belt.
My belt?!

19:57.350 --> 19:58.577
You said you were here for us!

19:58.697 --> 20:01.718
I am dear, but with the
economy how it is... What?

20:01.838 --> 20:02.794
My money isn't.

20:02.914 --> 20:04.226
You're in a limousine!

20:04.346 --> 20:08.581
And if I wanted to sit around all day
going nowhere, I'd be a teacher!

20:08.649 --> 20:10.556
Sorry dear, I have a fitting.

20:10.676 --> 20:11.815
Ciao!

20:11.935 --> 20:12.749
Fitting.

20:12.869 --> 20:15.403
And that's why people in this
family shouldn't have children.

20:15.523 --> 20:19.167
That, and a genetic
predisposition toward... Ants!

20:19.287 --> 20:22.595
Wh-?!
Wretched horrible ants!

20:22.663 --> 20:25.388
Ants are gonna be the least of
your worries, smackhound...

20:25.508 --> 20:27.128
Running around barefoot like that?

20:27.248 --> 20:28.423
Hello, hookworms!

20:28.543 --> 20:29.817
Get in my feet!

20:29.937 --> 20:31.176
Or... whatever.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.860
Some kinda worms.

20:33.652 --> 20:35.332
Will go in your feet.

20:36.176 --> 20:41.001
