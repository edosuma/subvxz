WEBVTT

00:05.719 --> 00:08.166
I just felt... (Whispers) A lot of anger.

00:08.167 --> 00:11.337
There was a face looking at us.

00:11.338 --> 00:14.123
(Amy whispers) I really don't
want to go down there.

00:14.124 --> 00:15.825
I was absolutely spooked.

00:15.826 --> 00:17.380
I just feel dead here.

00:17.381 --> 00:18.880
There was a body in the basement.

00:18.881 --> 00:20.997
Bludgeoned with a hammer.
(Camera shutter clicks)

00:20.998 --> 00:23.233
This is bad stuff.

00:23.234 --> 00:25.635
Well, are you afraid of
something happening to you?

00:25.636 --> 00:26.985
Yeah.

00:26.986 --> 00:29.746
Very, very angry.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.500
(Whispers) This guy scares me.

00:33.543 --> 00:35.712
My name is Amy Allan.

00:35.713 --> 00:36.750
(Bell tolls)

00:36.751 --> 00:38.190
There's something down there.

00:38.191 --> 00:39.892
I see dead people.

00:39.893 --> 00:41.293
He doesn't want me back there.

00:41.294 --> 00:43.629
I speak to dead people...

00:43.630 --> 00:45.197
She's pissed.

00:45.198 --> 00:46.332
And they speak to me...

00:46.333 --> 00:48.790
She doesn't like the people who live here.

00:48.791 --> 00:51.971
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:51.972 --> 00:53.593
Someone did hang themselves here.

00:53.594 --> 00:55.407
- Where?
- There.

00:55.408 --> 00:57.093
I rely on my partner.

00:57.094 --> 01:00.713
I'm Steve Dischiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective...

01:00.714 --> 01:02.215
Did you want to kill him?

01:02.216 --> 01:05.851
And I know every person, every house...
has secrets.

01:05.852 --> 01:07.559
She did die in this house.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.911
It's my job to reveal them.

01:08.912 --> 01:11.313
Would you be surprised if there
were bodies in this basement?

01:11.314 --> 01:12.218
No.

01:12.219 --> 01:13.776
But Steve and I never speak...

01:13.777 --> 01:15.694
We never communicated
during an investigation...

01:15.695 --> 01:17.129
Until the very end...

01:17.130 --> 01:18.430
Not good.

01:18.431 --> 01:20.566
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:20.567 --> 01:21.667
Will it get worse?

01:21.668 --> 01:22.868
Or time to get out.

01:22.869 --> 01:24.570
- Oh, yes.
- Whew.

01:24.571 --> 01:27.631
(Indistinct whispering)

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.973 --> 01:50.464
Steve will gather all of the facts while
he's performing his investigation.

01:50.465 --> 01:52.141
He interviews the witnesses.

01:52.142 --> 01:55.000
He finds out the history.

01:55.001 --> 01:57.820
Then we'll come together at the end.

01:57.821 --> 02:02.921
And find out if there's
anything that correlates.

02:03.329 --> 02:05.288
I'm in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

02:05.289 --> 02:09.192
This place was devastated by the
economy and riddled with crime...

02:09.193 --> 02:11.026
(Siren whoops)

02:11.027 --> 02:13.329
But recently it's been making a comeback.

02:13.330 --> 02:18.850
I'm down here to see a
restaurant owner named Jeffrey.

02:19.297 --> 02:25.197
Jeffrey owns a restaurant called "Plan B".
He bought it a couple years back.

02:25.570 --> 02:29.073
His, uh, staff is complaining
about unexplained phenomenon.

02:29.074 --> 02:31.157
They don't want to go in the
kitchen, they don't want

02:31.158 --> 02:33.265
to go in the basement, they
don't want to work late.

02:33.266 --> 02:36.503
So I'm gonna meet with him,
uh, find out what's going on.

02:36.504 --> 02:42.204
And try to find out what the
history of the building is.

02:53.239 --> 02:57.199
(Amy) Before I enter a location...

02:57.702 --> 02:59.904
Matt has already cleared that location

02:59.905 --> 03:04.765
of any information that
may influence my walk.

03:10.215 --> 03:13.275
(Police radio chatter)

03:18.256 --> 03:21.092
(Amy) I'm, like, already starting
to get physical sensations.

03:21.093 --> 03:23.733
(Exhales deeply)

03:24.738 --> 03:28.466
(Amy) En Route to the location,
I start feeling physical pain.

03:28.467 --> 03:30.291
Which is very unusual.

03:30.292 --> 03:33.362
There was, like, two sharp blows.

03:33.363 --> 03:36.663
First I felt in my jaw.

03:38.114 --> 03:40.317
I don't know what that is.

03:40.318 --> 03:43.518
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

03:43.519 --> 03:49.419
Wherever I'm heading, I know that something
very powerful is waiting for me.

03:59.035 --> 04:02.405
When I encounter the
dead, I am seeing them,

04:02.406 --> 04:06.509
just like I'm interacting
with a living person.

04:06.510 --> 04:10.380
But I might be communicating
with residual energy...

04:10.381 --> 04:14.417
Or I might be communicating
with dead people.

04:14.418 --> 04:18.488
That's what I've always
been trying to find out.

04:18.488 --> 04:22.029
So one person's showing up.

04:29.466 --> 04:33.966
I just felt... (Whispers) A lot of anger.

04:39.542 --> 04:41.762
In where?

04:47.384 --> 04:50.444
There's a male here.

04:51.354 --> 04:54.294
Lots of anger here.

04:54.357 --> 04:56.577
So angry.

04:57.962 --> 04:59.918
(Sighs)

04:59.919 --> 05:02.212
The problem, to him...

05:02.213 --> 05:04.433
Is women.

05:06.569 --> 05:08.429
Ooh.

05:08.673 --> 05:11.253
A woman hater.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.628
This guy scares me.

05:33.730 --> 05:37.167
Jeffrey, how are ya? Steve Dischiavi.

05:37.168 --> 05:38.904
Hi. Nice to meet you.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.529
Uh, beautiful place.

05:40.530 --> 05:42.513
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Beautiful, yeah.

05:42.514 --> 05:45.809
So you're having a little
issue here at the restaurant?

05:45.810 --> 05:49.501
Just some things have been happening
here that I felt might...

05:49.502 --> 05:52.502
Need some explaining.

05:59.856 --> 06:03.569
This is pretty much where I
spend my time during service.

06:03.570 --> 06:07.164
Uh, it gives me good access to
watching the front of the restaurant.

06:07.165 --> 06:10.305
Watching the people at the tables,
also watching the kitchen,

06:10.306 --> 06:15.635
making sure the food is
coming out right, and, um...

06:15.636 --> 06:20.940
More than just a few times,
I'll be standing here, and...

06:20.941 --> 06:23.810
I hear my name being called.

06:23.811 --> 06:26.679
Immediately I look around,
because I feel like

06:26.680 --> 06:28.581
it should be someone right next to me,

06:28.582 --> 06:32.385
speaking to me, and there's nobody around.

06:32.386 --> 06:34.387
Makes my hair stand up.

06:34.388 --> 06:36.677
Now has anybody else that works with you,

06:36.678 --> 06:38.965
had their name mentioned to them that...
that have...

06:38.966 --> 06:39.934
That I'm not sure.

06:39.935 --> 06:40.858
You don't know?

06:40.859 --> 06:42.929
(Steve) Guy thinks he's
hearing his name called out.

06:42.930 --> 06:45.932
In a busy restaurant, acoustic-wise,
that's bound to happen.

06:45.933 --> 06:48.902
It's not exactly proof that there's
paranormal activity going on.

06:48.903 --> 06:50.911
All right, is there anyplace
else in the restaurant

06:50.912 --> 06:54.474
you could show me they're having problems?
Um, the basement's really pretty...

06:54.475 --> 06:57.595
Uh, pretty frightening.

07:04.450 --> 07:08.420
(Whispers) I really don't
want to go down there.

07:08.421 --> 07:10.581
Oh, man.

07:12.892 --> 07:14.794
(Sighs)

07:14.795 --> 07:17.855
I feel like vomiting.

07:19.490 --> 07:21.530
(Sighs)

07:25.738 --> 07:30.958
Like, everything in my body
just, like, I don't...

07:32.876 --> 07:35.495
Usually I'm fine.

07:35.496 --> 07:36.778
(Creaks)

07:36.779 --> 07:41.159
I don't know why this is bothering me.

07:45.870 --> 07:51.510
Have you ever been so freaking
scared that you throw up?

07:51.804 --> 07:54.400
That's what I'm feeling right now.

07:54.401 --> 07:57.701
Like you know. (Chuckles)

07:59.105 --> 08:01.145
(Pants)

08:04.287 --> 08:07.319
There's something down there.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.720
Oh, my God.

08:21.938 --> 08:23.329
(Steve) So what's going on?

08:23.330 --> 08:26.332
The scariest thing for
me down here was, um...

08:26.333 --> 08:29.102
One afternoon a friend of
mine and I were down here

08:29.103 --> 08:32.427
trying to get some stuff
together, and, um...

08:32.428 --> 08:36.837
As we were walking down we were looking
back towards this back wall here.

08:36.839 --> 08:38.171
Um...

08:38.172 --> 08:40.726
There was a face...

08:40.727 --> 08:45.818
That looked like it was peering
through the 2x4s, looking at us.

08:45.819 --> 08:48.665
Can you describe the way it looked?
Was it a man?

08:48.666 --> 08:53.014
Yeah, it was definitely a gentleman. I
mean, it was just for, uh, a flash.

08:53.015 --> 08:55.416
Now did it look like it was an
actual person, where you went

08:55.417 --> 08:57.672
back there and said, "maybe
somebody's in the basement?"

08:57.673 --> 08:59.808
Yeah, I mean, we, you know,
like, were kinda startled

08:59.809 --> 09:02.115
and then walked back there,
and there was nothing there.

09:02.116 --> 09:05.841
- And your friend saw this also?
- Yes, she did.

09:05.842 --> 09:09.272
It was spooky. We kinda ran
up the stairs pretty quick.

09:09.273 --> 09:11.373
(Creaks)

09:11.952 --> 09:14.705
Now you must be frightened coming
down here, I mean, after I'd seen

09:14.706 --> 09:17.005
something like that, I don't
think I'd want to come down.

09:17.006 --> 09:18.565
It's not a place I like to come.

09:18.566 --> 09:21.026
(Man panting)

09:24.639 --> 09:27.720
I guess we should go down, but I
don't really want to go down there.

09:27.721 --> 09:29.540
(Creaks)

09:29.541 --> 09:34.147
(Amy) It was unusual to be at the top of
the stairs and not just run down them.

09:34.148 --> 09:37.150
Usually I just jump into situations

09:37.151 --> 09:42.459
that others probably consider
not very safe or smart.

09:42.460 --> 09:45.325
But in this case, I really
had to work through the fear

09:45.326 --> 09:49.628
in order to go down into the basement.

09:49.629 --> 09:50.653
(Bleep)

09:50.654 --> 09:53.414
(Chuckles) (Sighs)

09:54.167 --> 09:56.987
(Footsteps echoing)

10:10.035 --> 10:12.615
(Clears throat)

10:21.008 --> 10:24.728
Something did happen down here.

10:26.539 --> 10:29.836
It's like a hole, and, um...

10:29.837 --> 10:31.877
(Sighs)

10:31.973 --> 10:35.393
This nasty thing is there.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.396
Ooh. I don't like it. Not good.

10:39.397 --> 10:42.457
(Indistinct whispering)

10:54.635 --> 10:57.838
It's like a hole, and, um...

10:57.839 --> 10:59.873
(Sighs)

10:59.874 --> 11:03.294
This nasty thing is there.

11:04.611 --> 11:07.251
Right in there.

11:08.815 --> 11:13.253
(Amy) Every place has some kind of energy,
whether it's positive or negative.

11:13.254 --> 11:18.548
It's very rare to go into a
location that has no energy at all.

11:18.549 --> 11:23.683
I can only describe it as a void,
and it's very, very scary.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.466
(Clicks tongue)

11:25.467 --> 11:27.687
(Chuckles)

11:27.831 --> 11:30.711
This is bad stuff.

11:34.242 --> 11:36.443
(Steve) I decided to interview
some of Jeffrey's staff,

11:36.444 --> 11:38.159
to see what was going on around here.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.434
I started with his Head Chef Evan.

11:40.435 --> 11:42.662
I'm investigating, uh,

11:42.663 --> 11:45.353
some of the unusual activity that's
happening in this restaurant.

11:45.354 --> 11:47.357
Can you just give me a
background of what happened

11:47.358 --> 11:49.629
with you and what you
might have seen or heard?

11:49.630 --> 11:52.559
Well, actually a couple weeks ago, I
was, uh, upstairs working with Benny.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.411
And I turned around by the
staircase, and I actually, uh,

11:55.412 --> 11:59.912
saw a man walk by and around the corner.

12:03.419 --> 12:07.606
And he was walking focused, and he kinda
turned towards where the kitchen is

12:07.607 --> 12:11.838
and then just looked like he went right
downstairs, but that's where I lost him.

12:11.839 --> 12:17.402
I saw something, you know? I, uh, it wasn't
me imagining, it was definitely something.

12:17.403 --> 12:21.581
(Steve) So now I have two witnesses that
claim to have seen a male apparition.

12:21.582 --> 12:23.716
Once you have corroborating
witnesses like that,

12:23.717 --> 12:26.183
you gotta take things a
little bit more serious.

12:26.184 --> 12:29.155
At the time, did you
freak out, or it was...

12:29.156 --> 12:31.577
I was absolutely spooked.

12:31.578 --> 12:34.560
I actually stepped back and
looked up to Benny at that point.

12:34.561 --> 12:36.620
I was like, "Benny, did you see that?"

12:36.621 --> 12:40.880
And he was like, "no," but you knew that
he has probably seen something before,

12:40.881 --> 12:42.871
the way he said that

12:42.872 --> 12:47.957
and a few weeks later, I found out that
Benny has been terrified of this basement.

12:47.958 --> 12:52.518
Has been seeing and hearing things nonstop.

13:07.194 --> 13:11.631
I just feel dead here, just dead energy.

13:11.632 --> 13:12.973
(Creaking)

13:12.974 --> 13:15.485
Like, dead people or absence of...

13:15.486 --> 13:18.726
- (Amy) Absence.
- Okay.

13:21.436 --> 13:23.356
Oh...

13:27.536 --> 13:29.456
Okay.

13:33.587 --> 13:36.227
(Exhales deeply)

13:36.720 --> 13:40.853
There's something, like,
growling at me to my left.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.734
(Exhales unsteadily)

13:43.798 --> 13:46.738
There's something...

13:47.334 --> 13:50.837
Laughing and growling and...
(Clears throat)

13:50.838 --> 13:52.739
And touching my arm.

13:52.740 --> 13:55.320
(Clears throat)

13:58.578 --> 13:59.977
(Sighs)

13:59.978 --> 14:05.858
I'm not getting, like, a human,
like, form with this thing.

14:07.327 --> 14:10.447
This thing is, like...

14:12.659 --> 14:15.299
Evil. (Chuckles)

14:20.560 --> 14:23.500
Evan the Chef was sure Benny
was hiding something.

14:23.501 --> 14:28.967
So I need to speak with Benny to find
out why he's so afraid of the basement.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.470
How long have you been working here?

14:30.471 --> 14:32.528
Like, two years.

14:32.529 --> 14:37.649
Uh, can you explain to me what's been
going on, as far as what's weird?

14:37.650 --> 14:40.958
Uh, I don't really like to go
downstairs to the basement.

14:40.959 --> 14:44.428
Did something happen to you in the
basement that made you feel that way?

14:44.429 --> 14:46.170
Yeah.

14:46.171 --> 14:51.869
When I go down there, I feel, um, like,
weird, like somebody is downstairs...

14:51.870 --> 14:52.903
(Creaking)

14:52.904 --> 14:55.784
(Heartbeat pounding)

14:55.907 --> 14:58.309
Somebody's on my back.

14:58.310 --> 15:02.930
I feel, like, weird things, like, touch me.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.272
Ow. It's hurting my arm.

15:11.273 --> 15:12.744
(Sniffles)

15:12.745 --> 15:14.785
(Sighs)

15:14.926 --> 15:17.208
It's, like, this thing is...

15:17.209 --> 15:19.909
Something that...

15:23.167 --> 15:25.636
Really nasty...

15:25.637 --> 15:27.328
Dark...

15:27.329 --> 15:29.489
Darkness.

15:30.153 --> 15:32.553
What is it?

15:33.110 --> 15:34.879
Mm...

15:34.880 --> 15:37.220
Well, um...

15:37.282 --> 15:41.622
I guess that the closest thing
that I could relate it to...

15:41.623 --> 15:43.963
Would be...

15:44.569 --> 15:46.357
A demon.

15:46.358 --> 15:48.779
(Indistinct sounds)

15:48.780 --> 15:53.981
I've only encountered these types
of entities a handful of times.

15:53.982 --> 15:58.662
And these things can be
extremely dangerous.

15:59.145 --> 16:01.511
It can move objects.

16:01.512 --> 16:05.052
It can manipulate perception.

16:05.488 --> 16:06.754
It can...

16:06.755 --> 16:09.155
Strike fear.

16:09.860 --> 16:14.312
I think this one really
likes to scare people.

16:14.313 --> 16:17.166
Are you afraid when you go down there?

16:17.167 --> 16:19.087
Yeah.

16:20.209 --> 16:22.368
Do you feel like you're in physical danger?

16:22.369 --> 16:24.266
Yeah.

16:24.267 --> 16:26.434
How many times has this happened to you?

16:26.435 --> 16:28.485
- Every single day.
- Every time you go downstairs?

16:28.486 --> 16:30.406
Yeah.

16:33.341 --> 16:36.911
There's this root of, like...

16:36.912 --> 16:38.379
(Smacks lips)

16:38.380 --> 16:40.300
Evil.

16:42.783 --> 16:45.253
(Amy) I'm not sure where they come from.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.189
I don't know if there's a
hell or anything like that,

16:48.190 --> 16:54.090
but what I do know is that they
do exist, and they're very nasty.

16:59.183 --> 17:01.318
(Steve) Jeffrey moved here
only three years ago,

17:01.319 --> 17:06.046
and he rented the building without
checking into its history...

17:06.047 --> 17:08.452
So I need to find out if anything
went wrong in that place,

17:08.453 --> 17:09.794
before he opened the restaurant.

17:09.795 --> 17:12.012
(Clicks and whirs)

17:12.012 --> 17:15.762
It takes me about 15 minutes
to find out what happened.

17:15.762 --> 17:17.983
Jeffrey is gonna wish he'd
spent 15 minutes doing

17:17.984 --> 17:21.054
a little more research before
he opened his restaurant.

17:21.055 --> 17:23.519
There was a murder that took
place in this location,

17:23.520 --> 17:27.527
a brutal murder about 14 years ago.

17:27.528 --> 17:33.428
I'm still gonna need to speak to the
people that know the most about the case.

17:42.298 --> 17:45.761
I got some information about this
homicide that happened in '97.

17:45.762 --> 17:47.335
Uh, that was in an antique shop,

17:47.336 --> 17:49.847
uh, but being a former Detective
myself, I knew the best thing

17:49.848 --> 17:52.363
to do was go to the detectives
that, uh, worked the case.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.479
So if either one of yous could just,
start out and just tell me, you know,

17:55.480 --> 17:58.226
when you got there, what you
observed and what you saw.

17:58.227 --> 18:01.284
We responded about 6 pm
in the evening on...

18:01.285 --> 18:04.220
Uh, April 29th, which was a Tuesday.

18:04.221 --> 18:07.924
And, uh, there was a body in the basement
of the building on Cookman Avenue.

18:07.925 --> 18:09.953
Ray Johnson was 72 years old.

18:09.954 --> 18:12.129
He was the owner and operator of...

18:12.130 --> 18:15.057
"When I was a child" collectibles,
which was the scene of the crime.

18:15.058 --> 18:19.038
Uh, it was a pretty
gruesome scene at the time.

18:19.039 --> 18:20.919
Vile.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.960
(Pants)

18:26.266 --> 18:28.903
(Voice echoes) Yeah.

18:28.904 --> 18:32.084
Something happened here.

18:33.798 --> 18:36.273
Something with my... the
right side of my face...

18:36.274 --> 18:39.634
(Voice echoes) On my jaw.

18:40.672 --> 18:44.895
Anything you can remember specifically
about the body or, uh, the scene itself,

18:44.896 --> 18:46.874
when you guys actually got into the scene?

18:46.875 --> 18:52.775
We were informed by the Forensics team that
the body was in the basement on the floor.

18:53.513 --> 18:57.353
(Amy) There's, like, an anger...

18:59.086 --> 19:00.766
And a...

19:00.767 --> 19:02.867
Despair.

19:04.065 --> 19:08.069
One is despair, and one is anger, and
the anger is pounding on the despair.

19:08.070 --> 19:09.615
These are people.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.111
(Smacks)

19:11.112 --> 19:14.712
"Smack you. I'll smack you".

19:16.485 --> 19:19.385
Mr. Johnson's head was
bludgeoned with a hammer.

19:19.386 --> 19:22.260
(Camera shutter clicks)

19:22.261 --> 19:24.301
(Pants)

19:26.293 --> 19:28.327
Like, "I want to smash you down".

19:28.328 --> 19:31.388
(Indistinct whispering)

19:53.317 --> 19:55.010
This is our perp?

19:55.011 --> 19:56.498
That is. That's, uh, Moses Farrow.

19:56.499 --> 20:00.323
Uh, he was ultimately arrested and
charged with the homicide of Ray.

20:00.324 --> 20:04.590
Uh, what can you tell me about Moses,
as far as, uh, his background? I, uh...

20:04.591 --> 20:09.024
Moses was 20 years old at the time.
Uh, he was homeless.

20:09.025 --> 20:11.321
He was working for, uh, our victim?

20:11.322 --> 20:17.222
He worked for Ray for about three or
four days prior, uh, to the homicide.

20:17.732 --> 20:20.638
In his statement to us.

20:20.639 --> 20:25.172
He talks about Ray coming up behind
him and grabbing his buttocks.

20:25.173 --> 20:29.876
And he turns around and hits
Ray once with the hammer.

20:29.877 --> 20:33.413
Uh, Ray according to him, does not go down.

20:33.414 --> 20:35.688
He's staggering but not down.

20:35.689 --> 20:39.714
He hits him a second time, and
Ray goes down to the ground.

20:39.715 --> 20:42.951
And then he stands over him and
hits him more in the head,

20:42.952 --> 20:44.504
while he's down on the ground.

20:44.505 --> 20:47.625
(Camera shutter clicks)

20:56.805 --> 20:58.106
(Sighs)

20:58.107 --> 21:01.647
( Inhales and exhales deeply)

21:03.211 --> 21:07.636
(Amy) I just see, like, his energy is here.

21:07.637 --> 21:10.105
It's very, very...

21:10.106 --> 21:13.046
Solid energy, but...

21:13.684 --> 21:16.340
It's not like I'm talking to...

21:16.341 --> 21:18.201
Him.

21:20.695 --> 21:23.335
He's not here.

21:25.828 --> 21:30.403
The way that I encountered this
male was as a residual energy.

21:30.404 --> 21:33.807
At some point, something
very violent happened here.

21:33.808 --> 21:38.548
And a part of his
personality still remains.

21:44.884 --> 21:48.480
He was here once, and then
he left, but he left this...

21:48.481 --> 21:50.821
Stuff here.

21:51.125 --> 21:54.905
It's just what remains of him.

21:56.529 --> 22:02.409
His energy is here, but do you
know if he is dead himself?

22:08.476 --> 22:11.356
I don't think so.

22:12.078 --> 22:14.308
He had a girlfriend that
lived in Ocean Grove,

22:14.309 --> 22:16.905
which is the next town
over from Asbury Park.

22:16.906 --> 22:18.248
Uh, we spoke with her.

22:18.249 --> 22:22.838
She... she grabbed us and said,
"he told me, he did it".

22:22.839 --> 22:25.471
Ultimately he gets
convicted, is that correct?

22:25.472 --> 22:31.372
That's correct. He's doing 30 years
currently at Trenton State Prison.

22:32.078 --> 22:34.647
(Steve) The detectives were
able to tell me what he did.

22:34.648 --> 22:39.752
Now I gotta find somebody that was close
to Moses to find out why he did it.

22:39.753 --> 22:42.655
I spoke with the two detectives that, uh,

22:42.656 --> 22:44.750
locked up Moses, and
they gave me your name.

22:44.751 --> 22:48.127
So at the time Moses was your boyfriend.

22:48.128 --> 22:51.662
And he lived with you on and off, and they
actually apprehended him in your apartment?

22:51.663 --> 22:53.202
- Yes.
- What I need for you to...

22:53.203 --> 22:56.602
If you can, is tell me what you
can remember from that time.

22:56.603 --> 22:59.519
He showed up. I was on the phone
with my girlfriend, and I was

22:59.520 --> 23:03.643
washing dishes or something, and
he said, "I killed my boss".

23:03.644 --> 23:06.517
I really just didn't believe it was true.

23:06.518 --> 23:10.068
I thought he was just being crazy,
because, you know, who kills somebody

23:10.069 --> 23:13.252
and then just goes and tells
somebody that you killed somebody?

23:13.253 --> 23:16.419
- So you weren't scared?
- I was not scared of him.

23:16.420 --> 23:20.244
I knew he wasn't gonna do anything to me.
I was never afraid of him.

23:20.245 --> 23:26.145
I do believe that there are events
that can happen in life that can...

23:26.631 --> 23:32.531
Destroy someone's psyche, to a point
where they don't think rationally.

23:45.700 --> 23:49.258
His thought processes are very...

23:49.259 --> 23:52.439
Distorted and disturbed.

23:53.137 --> 23:56.677
He doesn't perceive reality.

23:57.542 --> 23:59.762
And he...

24:01.412 --> 24:03.587
You know, he feels...

24:03.588 --> 24:05.628
(Sighs)

24:06.224 --> 24:09.460
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

24:09.461 --> 24:11.837
I don't like him.

24:11.838 --> 24:14.031
I do not like this person at all.

24:14.032 --> 24:17.092
(Indistinct whispering)

24:32.410 --> 24:33.503
(Inhales deeply)

24:33.504 --> 24:35.671
I do not like this person at all.

24:35.672 --> 24:39.032
Mnh-mnh. He was in jail.

24:39.232 --> 24:41.490
There was time done there.

24:41.491 --> 24:43.711
For what?

24:45.260 --> 24:48.020
Robbery, burglary.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.399
Where was he in prison?

24:50.400 --> 24:52.440
(Sighs)

24:53.869 --> 24:56.989
(Sighs) Um... not far.

24:58.776 --> 25:00.936
Not far.

25:02.767 --> 25:06.336
(Steve) I take a 30-minute ride to
visit Moses at Trenton State Prison.

25:06.337 --> 25:09.706
I've gotten about as much background
information as I can about the case.

25:09.707 --> 25:12.042
Now it's time to talk to the killer.

25:12.043 --> 25:16.013
I've interviewed a lot of people,
detectives, people you may know,

25:16.014 --> 25:19.316
so why don't you just bring
me to what brought you

25:19.317 --> 25:21.251
to that point on Cookman Avenue?

25:21.252 --> 25:22.618
I was working there.

25:22.619 --> 25:26.274
One day I was in the basement
pulling nails out of wood.

25:26.275 --> 25:29.293
While I bent over to pull a nail
out of the wood with the hammer,

25:29.294 --> 25:32.462
and Raymond Johnson walked
past me and grabbed my ass.

25:32.463 --> 25:36.500
So I just hit him upside
the head with the hammer.

25:36.501 --> 25:39.929
Was that the first time that had
happened, that he touched you?

25:39.930 --> 25:41.144
Yeah.

25:41.145 --> 25:44.508
You didn't hit him upside the head just
once, and you know, and I know that.

25:44.509 --> 25:50.209
Yeah. When it happened, I just
turned around and hit him.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.979
Did you want to kill
him, or did you just...

25:52.980 --> 25:55.585
Want to make a point by hitting him
upside the head with a hammer?

25:55.586 --> 25:57.921
Just make a point. Don't touch me.

25:57.922 --> 26:03.822
You made your point nine or ten
times, you know that, right?

26:08.532 --> 26:11.563
The demon gets angry.

26:11.564 --> 26:14.324
Very, very angry.

26:14.505 --> 26:17.745
I think it influences...

26:19.474 --> 26:22.174
It wreaks havoc.

26:23.213 --> 26:26.993
(Matt) How does it wreak havoc?

26:28.352 --> 26:30.152
Oh.

26:42.833 --> 26:47.304
When you look at your record, this came
out of nowhere, this... this murder.

26:47.305 --> 26:50.240
It just... it... it... that...
it's a little odd.

26:50.241 --> 26:52.409
It wasn't planned.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.278
Did you have thoughts of
doing that to anybody,

26:54.279 --> 26:56.293
or even him prior to that happening?

26:56.294 --> 26:58.094
No.

26:58.397 --> 27:02.249
You'd never done anything violent in the
past before this incident with Raymond?

27:02.250 --> 27:04.410
Mnh-mnh.

27:05.239 --> 27:06.552
(Exhales deeply)

27:06.553 --> 27:11.293
I don't know what brought me to that point.

27:13.778 --> 27:16.728
(Steve) When Amy sees
an identifiable figure.

27:16.729 --> 27:22.629
She often brings in a sketch artist
to put her findings down on paper.

27:29.093 --> 27:34.565
(Amy) So the lips are fuller on
the bottom, thinner on the top.

27:34.566 --> 27:37.271
I just saw him pissed off.

27:37.272 --> 27:40.812
Yeah. Yeah. Angry. Yeah. Mm.

27:41.405 --> 27:44.405
His nose is, like...

27:45.053 --> 27:48.479
Flat, kinda like a boxer's nose,
like a punch smooshed it.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.400
Okay.

27:50.715 --> 27:52.683
How about his, uh, his eyes?

27:52.684 --> 27:57.724
His eyes are, like, so
dark brown, almost black.

28:02.422 --> 28:06.982
Like, I'm feeling the anger now from him.

28:07.665 --> 28:09.200
(Sighs)

28:09.201 --> 28:12.324
Yeah, this is weird. (Chuckles)

28:12.325 --> 28:14.854
Okay. I thought it would
just be a normal thing.

28:14.855 --> 28:18.442
I should've protected myself.
I didn't... I had no idea.

28:18.443 --> 28:21.323
(Scratching echoing)

28:23.214 --> 28:25.974
He's right there.

28:25.975 --> 28:31.355
He's wearing a yellow shirt now
with, like, some stuff on it.

28:31.356 --> 28:36.996
And he's yelling at me to
shut the (Bleep) Up, (Bleep).

28:39.663 --> 28:43.563
I kinda want to leave. (Chuckles)

28:43.769 --> 28:45.278
Um, I'm just really nervous.

28:45.279 --> 28:47.596
(Voice breaks) I don't like him.

28:47.597 --> 28:49.485
(Sighs)

28:49.486 --> 28:52.786
- Okay.
- You all right?

28:54.411 --> 28:57.471
(Indistinct whispering)

29:19.077 --> 29:22.030
(Steve) Jeff's the reason we're here.
He, uh, he owns the restaurant.

29:22.031 --> 29:25.556
Uh, he's having some
unexplained events happen...

29:25.557 --> 29:28.400
- To him. Your staff...
- Yes.

29:28.401 --> 29:32.155
Um, and it's causing some
disruption for work.

29:32.156 --> 29:35.487
Me and Amy haven't talked since
we started the investigation.

29:35.488 --> 29:38.733
Amy came in, and she did a walk-through,
and if it's okay with you,

29:38.734 --> 29:42.328
I'd like to hear from her, tell
us both what she saw that night.

29:42.329 --> 29:44.630
- Sure. That would be great. Thank you.
- Okay?

29:44.631 --> 29:47.660
So when I came in and did the walk.

29:47.661 --> 29:51.204
When I got to the back of the restaurant...

29:51.205 --> 29:53.933
I encountered a male energy.

29:53.934 --> 29:59.034
And this male is very
aggressive, um, very angry.

29:59.418 --> 30:01.781
Wow. I just felt, like...

30:01.782 --> 30:04.016
(Whispering) A lot of anger.

30:04.017 --> 30:05.605
(Sighs)

30:05.606 --> 30:09.102
There's a lot of anger going on here.

30:09.103 --> 30:15.003
We're talking about excessive amounts of
rage and anger and hatred and just...

30:15.230 --> 30:19.130
A very bad, person that dwells...

30:19.199 --> 30:20.834
- Right.
- In this.

30:20.835 --> 30:24.615
And he was, like, stocky build.

30:25.038 --> 30:27.607
He also had, with his nose,

30:27.608 --> 30:31.744
um, which was probably the
most distinct, um, feature...

30:31.745 --> 30:35.057
Uh, it looked like he had
been in a lot of fights.

30:35.058 --> 30:40.364
Um, because it was, um, the
bridge was basically smooshed in.

30:40.365 --> 30:43.189
I got that he was in prison.

30:43.190 --> 30:48.230
Um, there's robbery,
burglary, and weapons there.

30:48.295 --> 30:50.200
He...

30:50.201 --> 30:54.600
Has done a lot of very
bad things in his life.

30:54.601 --> 31:00.501
Um, the other thing is, I think that
this individual is still alive.

31:01.574 --> 31:03.976
His energy is here.

31:03.977 --> 31:05.811
He's not here.

31:05.812 --> 31:07.613
(Matt) Do you know if he is dead himself?

31:07.614 --> 31:09.654
(Sighs)

31:10.551 --> 31:12.865
I don't think so.

31:12.866 --> 31:15.031
So let me get this right.

31:15.032 --> 31:17.657
You're getting energy from
somebody that's still alive?

31:17.658 --> 31:18.624
Potentially, yes.

31:18.625 --> 31:20.393
- Potentially still alive.
- Yes.

31:20.394 --> 31:24.923
It's amazing to me, uh, your description
of him, because during my research...

31:24.924 --> 31:28.728
Uh, and investigation of the
building itself and its background.

31:28.729 --> 31:32.171
Um, about 14 years ago there was
a male fitting that description.

31:32.172 --> 31:34.184
That did work in this building.

31:34.185 --> 31:37.722
Okay, so I'm gonna show you a
photo of who I think it may be.

31:37.723 --> 31:40.912
You take a look at it.

31:40.913 --> 31:43.133
Go ahead.

31:44.687 --> 31:46.886
And, Amy, what are you feeling
when you see this photo?

31:46.887 --> 31:48.421
(Clears throat)

31:48.422 --> 31:51.057
I'm sick to my stomach. (Chuckles)

31:51.058 --> 31:52.692
It's making me uncomfortable.

31:52.693 --> 31:54.060
Okay. (Clears throat)

31:54.061 --> 31:58.839
Now, uh, we brought in a sketch
artist for Amy to sit with.

31:58.840 --> 32:02.969
And she was able to describe who she saw
the night you did the walk-through.

32:02.970 --> 32:04.863
I have that with me. I
haven't seen it yet...

32:04.864 --> 32:06.539
- Okay.
- And we'll...

32:06.540 --> 32:11.040
Maybe we'll compare and see what we got.

32:14.145 --> 32:17.085
- Wow.
- All right.

32:24.824 --> 32:26.643
It's... it's...

32:26.644 --> 32:29.944
Uncanny how close it is.

32:30.910 --> 32:33.792
Now, Amy, this picture here...

32:33.793 --> 32:39.492
When you look at his face, does that bring
you back to the night you did the walk?

32:39.493 --> 32:44.134
(Whispers) This guy scares me.
I don't like him.

32:44.135 --> 32:46.215
That's, like...

32:46.216 --> 32:48.579
- Okay.
- That's...

32:48.580 --> 32:49.834
Really frightening.

32:49.835 --> 32:52.644
This is why I had that shocked look
on my face when I pulled this out,

32:52.645 --> 32:56.384
because I couldn't... I
can't equate how she has...

32:56.385 --> 32:59.331
A vision of somebody that's
alive, that I just spoke to.

32:59.332 --> 33:01.792
Oh, it's... it's... frightening.

33:01.793 --> 33:04.060
It's him.

33:04.061 --> 33:09.365
The look in his eyes, which I really
tried hard to capture with the sketch...

33:09.366 --> 33:12.746
That... that's the thing that's
really bothering me. (Laughs)

33:12.747 --> 33:15.269
- Yeah, I don't like this person at all.
- You're making me...

33:15.270 --> 33:17.192
- You're making me very nervous.
- I'm sorry.

33:17.193 --> 33:18.596
It's all right.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.297
( Exhales deeply)

33:21.346 --> 33:22.323
So who's this?

33:22.324 --> 33:25.431
Well, let me just give you a little bit
further of what I found out about...

33:25.432 --> 33:27.298
- The history of the building.
- Okay.

33:27.299 --> 33:29.467
About 14 years ago this
was an antique shop.

33:29.468 --> 33:31.588
Uh, it was owned by a man
named Raymond Johnson.

33:31.589 --> 33:32.428
Okay.

33:32.429 --> 33:34.255
He was about a 72 year old man.

33:34.256 --> 33:37.909
He was viciously murdered in
the basement of this building.

33:37.910 --> 33:40.311
I have a photo of Raymond.

33:40.312 --> 33:43.100
He was prominent in the gay community.

33:43.101 --> 33:46.749
He was nice enough to bring this
individual, Moses Farrow...

33:46.750 --> 33:48.321
- Who was homeless.
- Mm.

33:48.322 --> 33:50.514
He brought him in, fed
him, put him to work.

33:50.515 --> 33:55.486
According to Moses, Raymond did
a sexual advance towards him.

33:55.487 --> 33:59.290
And he turned around with the
hammer that he had in his hand.

33:59.291 --> 34:02.373
And he just beat him in the head.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.904
I mean, he beat him between 9
and 12 times with the hammer.

34:05.905 --> 34:07.014
Oh, my God.

34:07.015 --> 34:11.695
Wow. That's, like, making some sense to me.

34:11.768 --> 34:13.989
In the basement...

34:13.989 --> 34:19.072
I did feel there was two, uh,
emotions that I encountered.

34:19.072 --> 34:22.612
There was anger and despair.

34:23.340 --> 34:28.320
Anger is pounding on the
despair, and... (Sighs)

34:30.130 --> 34:34.239
And I also had an extreme amount of pain.

34:34.241 --> 34:36.972
Um, specifically the right jaw.

34:36.973 --> 34:41.549
And then it... it went to the
whole, um, right side of the head.

34:41.550 --> 34:45.091
The pain was just so intense.

34:45.092 --> 34:49.099
Something happened. Something with my...
the right side of my face...

34:49.100 --> 34:51.984
(Voice echoes) On my jaw.

34:51.985 --> 34:55.132
And he was apprehended, did go to trial.

34:55.132 --> 34:58.824
And he is incarcerated currently
in Trenton State Prison,

34:58.825 --> 35:00.225
maybe an hour from here.

35:00.226 --> 35:04.263
I did get that he was in a prison nearby.

35:04.264 --> 35:06.994
I'm still trying to wrap around how you get

35:06.995 --> 35:09.548
visions of people that are
actually still alive.

35:09.549 --> 35:11.254
Uh, it... it's mind-boggling to me.

35:11.255 --> 35:16.372
I guess for me, if I knew it was
someone that wasn't still alive...

35:16.373 --> 35:18.818
That I'd have an easier
time dealing with it.

35:18.819 --> 35:22.017
But someone who's still alive...

35:22.018 --> 35:23.622
Makes me very uncomfortable.

35:23.623 --> 35:26.918
Even though he's still alive...

35:26.919 --> 35:30.466
Things can happen throughout our
lives that are very traumatic.

35:30.467 --> 35:33.979
And sometimes when those incidents happen,

35:33.980 --> 35:38.070
they can disperse into the surroundings.

35:38.071 --> 35:41.740
And so if we have a very
traumatic experience,

35:41.741 --> 35:45.110
or we are extremely angry
like this person...

35:45.111 --> 35:45.914
Right.

35:45.915 --> 35:50.985
Um, you can leave traces of
that in the environment.

35:50.986 --> 35:52.906
Okay.

35:53.186 --> 35:56.215
- I did speak with Moses' ex girlfriend.
- Mm.

35:56.216 --> 35:59.658
She's actually the one who helped
the police track him down...

35:59.659 --> 36:00.560
Really?

36:00.561 --> 36:05.358
And she felt that, you know, uh, he
was ready to snap, and this was it.

36:05.359 --> 36:09.663
I do believe that there are events
that can happen in life that can...

36:09.664 --> 36:11.631
Destroy someone's psyche.

36:11.632 --> 36:14.897
She feels that it just came to a
head down in the basement here...

36:14.898 --> 36:16.364
- Right.
- That makes sense.

36:16.365 --> 36:21.131
And that, when, uh, Mr. Johnson
did the sexual advance...

36:21.132 --> 36:23.410
That, well, he says that he
did, that he just snapped...

36:23.411 --> 36:24.500
Wow.

36:24.501 --> 36:28.423
But he snapped to the tune of 9 to 12
shots to the head with the hammer.

36:28.424 --> 36:31.041
That poses another question for me.

36:31.042 --> 36:36.428
If his footprint is left here, am
I realizing some of his anger?

36:36.429 --> 36:39.729
Honestly, his footprint...

36:40.211 --> 36:45.337
Is not particularly capable
of interacting with anyone.

36:45.338 --> 36:46.905
It's just a footprint.

36:46.906 --> 36:48.183
Let me ask you a question.

36:48.184 --> 36:52.011
Everybody's having, uh, a
sensation of getting touched.

36:52.012 --> 36:55.114
And a heavy feeling in the basement.

36:55.115 --> 36:56.304
Mm-hmm. That makes sense.

36:56.305 --> 36:58.503
Well, that's what I'm trying
to find out I'm a little

36:58.504 --> 37:01.392
confused with having an energy
up here, and in the basement,

37:01.393 --> 37:04.022
- is where they're feeling everything.
- The residual...

37:04.023 --> 37:07.903
Energy that he left behind is upstairs.

37:07.904 --> 37:13.724
Right. What you have in the
basement is something different.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.894
(Indistinct whispering)

37:30.059 --> 37:34.730
The residual energy that he
left behind is upstairs.

37:34.731 --> 37:39.342
What you have in the basement
is something different.

37:39.343 --> 37:43.063
I went back into the basement.

37:43.099 --> 37:47.270
And all of sudden there
was kind of this void.

37:47.271 --> 37:52.129
I was stumped, because usually there's
some type of energy everywhere...

37:52.130 --> 37:54.896
- Right.
- And this was just kind of...

37:54.897 --> 37:56.997
Nothing.

37:57.580 --> 38:00.917
It's like a hole, and, um...

38:00.918 --> 38:02.958
(Sighs)

38:03.053 --> 38:06.473
This nasty thing is there.

38:07.690 --> 38:10.330
Right in there.

38:12.228 --> 38:14.289
And I looked...

38:14.290 --> 38:17.102
And I saw this little...

38:17.103 --> 38:19.383
Dark mass.

38:20.141 --> 38:21.159
The...

38:21.160 --> 38:24.100
Being approached me.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.846
And...

38:25.847 --> 38:30.665
As it was approaching me,
and then touching me.

38:30.666 --> 38:35.823
I understood that, in fact,
this thing was very old.

38:35.824 --> 38:38.106
Um, was never human.

38:38.107 --> 38:41.947
And, um, is very, very negative.

38:44.477 --> 38:46.343
There's something... (Clears throat)

38:46.344 --> 38:48.249
Touching my arm.

38:48.250 --> 38:49.000
(Clears throat)

38:49.001 --> 38:53.721
I'm not getting, like, a human,
like, form with this thing.

38:53.722 --> 38:56.422
This thing is...

38:56.625 --> 38:58.545
Evil.

39:01.029 --> 39:05.428
This thing has been here
for hundreds of years.

39:05.429 --> 39:06.608
- It...
- How...

39:06.609 --> 39:10.209
Can cause things to happen...

39:11.414 --> 39:15.314
Bad luck, uh, emotional outbursts.

39:16.104 --> 39:19.138
In the Catholic religion...

39:19.139 --> 39:23.567
These types of things would
be referred to as a demon.

39:23.568 --> 39:26.299
They're extremely rare.

39:26.300 --> 39:29.591
I've only encountered them
in a handful of situations,

39:29.592 --> 39:32.844
and I've done hundreds of investigations.

39:32.845 --> 39:36.981
It's capable of manipulating an
individual's thoughts and emotions.

39:36.982 --> 39:41.386
It can take on any form
that would unnerve someone.

39:41.387 --> 39:44.003
Taking the opportunity to...

39:44.004 --> 39:47.392
Latch on to a person who
is ready to snap...

39:47.393 --> 39:49.127
- Oh, my God.
- And letting them go for it.

39:49.128 --> 39:50.294
Whoa.

39:50.295 --> 39:54.532
So whatever entity you're talking
about might have caused our...

39:54.533 --> 39:55.499
Yes.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.505
Who was already an emotional
wreck to begin with.

39:57.506 --> 39:59.966
Correct. Yes.

40:01.105 --> 40:03.908
Amy this has me really freaked out.

40:03.909 --> 40:08.557
It's... seems, uh, a lot worse than...
than I anticipated.

40:08.558 --> 40:12.294
I've been hit pretty hard
for the past five years.

40:12.295 --> 40:14.579
And, um, this is...

40:14.580 --> 40:17.564
This is, like, freaking me out.

40:17.565 --> 40:21.589
Can this be affecting me
inside these four walls...

40:21.590 --> 40:24.772
And can it follow me
outside these four walls?

40:24.773 --> 40:27.533
Um, yes to both.

40:29.077 --> 40:34.748
I want to tell you that there
are, um, things that we can do.

40:34.749 --> 40:37.656
You have options available.

40:37.657 --> 40:40.141
One is, yes, you could move.

40:40.142 --> 40:44.624
Um, the other one is that we
could do something proactive

40:44.625 --> 40:46.649
to get rid of this thing.

40:46.650 --> 40:49.100
We are lucky enough that...

40:49.101 --> 40:53.455
Out of the handful of beings
that I've met like this.

40:53.456 --> 40:56.058
This one is very young.

40:56.059 --> 40:58.411
I would equate it to a baby.

40:58.412 --> 41:02.231
Which means it's very easy to get rid of.

41:02.232 --> 41:06.586
This thing right now is using negativity...

41:06.587 --> 41:09.887
To feed and grow itself.

41:10.256 --> 41:12.007
You don't have to give it that.

41:12.008 --> 41:16.011
You have the power now to get rid of it.

41:16.012 --> 41:19.615
So what do I do to try to...

41:19.616 --> 41:21.351
I guess, annihilate this?

41:21.352 --> 41:23.061
We will go through this together.

41:23.062 --> 41:26.387
I will show you what needs to be done.

41:26.388 --> 41:29.558
But you have to promise me
that you will continue it here

41:29.559 --> 41:31.293
- and at your home and...
- No problem.

41:31.294 --> 41:33.890
For the benefit of yourself
and your employees.

41:33.891 --> 41:38.043
No, I promise that I will do that,
and, uh, I'd like to get it started

41:38.044 --> 41:39.342
as soon as possible.

41:39.343 --> 41:41.263
Okay.

41:41.814 --> 41:44.034
(Creaking)

41:50.189 --> 41:52.264
We have a doorway here.

41:52.265 --> 41:55.461
So you're gonna want to just, in a circle.

41:55.462 --> 41:59.422
Letting the smoke purify the area.

41:59.426 --> 42:01.500
All negativity must leave this place.

42:01.501 --> 42:03.836
No negativity may remain in this place.

42:03.837 --> 42:07.083
Only love, light, and peace may enter.
