WEBVTT

00:09.224 --> 00:11.943
Now for a difficult one.

00:15.689 --> 00:19.523
Firm, velvety rind, bit smoky.

00:20.402 --> 00:22.393
Applewood, I think.

00:22.654 --> 00:25.851
This is what I get for sending you
to camp in France.

00:26.158 --> 00:28.956
Can I help you with anything else?

00:29.244 --> 00:32.360
No, thanks.
This $6 can of dog food will be fine.

00:33.665 --> 00:37.544
It'll sure teach me not to leave my
shopping until the last minute again.

00:37.878 --> 00:40.995
- Is it Reblochon?
- You are good, Dr Crane.

00:41.298 --> 00:43.289
Yeah, he's a regular cheese whiz.

00:44.718 --> 00:46.788
I'll take half a pound of the Reblochon

00:47.054 --> 00:51.206
and half a pound of Saint Andre and
I know I ask this every week, but...

00:51.558 --> 00:53.788
-...is it here?
- Is what here?

00:54.061 --> 00:56.621
You know
I mean the imported Swiss prosciutto.

00:56.897 --> 01:00.173
The Bündnerfleisch. I am sorry.

01:00.484 --> 01:03.237
If only you had been here one hour ago.

01:03.528 --> 01:07.077
- Damn.
- You would have seen it arrive.

01:09.326 --> 01:11.635
- I have my fun with you.
- You do, Robert.

01:11.912 --> 01:14.585
I long for the days
when you barely spoke English.

01:14.873 --> 01:17.262
Slice like the wind.
I'll take a pound.

01:17.542 --> 01:21.660
18 dollars a pound? This
salami's good, but it's not that good.

01:22.005 --> 01:23.996
It was aged for six months

01:24.257 --> 01:27.533
and air-cured in a small village
at the foot of the Pyrenees.

01:27.844 --> 01:30.404
- A steal at that price.
- You got that right, pal.

01:30.681 --> 01:33.241
Dad, if you want to wait outside...

01:33.517 --> 01:37.396
I'm fine. Look at all these
different kinds of olive oil.

01:37.729 --> 01:40.038
Virgin, extra virgin...

01:41.483 --> 01:45.192
Extra virgin?
How does that work?

01:46.905 --> 01:49.863
I guess if you can cure a sausage...

01:51.660 --> 01:55.255
Monsieur, I am so glad
you find my food so amusing.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.014
Robert, he's only joking.
Keep on slicing.

01:58.291 --> 02:02.079
Come on now. Even you've got to admit
this whole store is kind of nutty.

02:02.421 --> 02:05.140
$14 for a pound of goat cheese?

02:05.424 --> 02:08.416
For that price,
I ought to be able to get a whole goat.

02:08.719 --> 02:10.949
And we're slicing.

02:11.221 --> 02:15.134
Perhaps you would be more
comfortable if you just waited outside.

02:15.475 --> 02:17.386
You want me to leave,
come out and say it.

02:17.644 --> 02:20.761
- Fine. Leave from my store.
- No problem. Come on, Niles.

02:21.064 --> 02:25.376
- He wants us to "leave from his store".
- Don't hurry back.

02:25.736 --> 02:29.695
All the money in the world
wouldn't get me back in this snob shop.

02:32.075 --> 02:35.784
He is my father. So I can't leave here
with a bag of your merchandise.

02:36.121 --> 02:38.112
- Home delivery?
- Thank you.

02:39.291 --> 02:42.567
No one treats my father that way.
Those olives, too. No one.

02:49.301 --> 02:51.940
About the photo shoot?
Will you need make-up?

02:52.220 --> 02:53.335
Heavens no.

02:53.555 --> 02:57.309
I think that you look
very handsome without it.

02:57.643 --> 03:02.114
Really? I think you look
very attractive with make-up.

03:02.481 --> 03:07.714
Not that you need it. But if you are
wearing make-up, it's so well applied

03:08.111 --> 03:10.705
that I wouldn't even know
you're wearing make-up.

03:10.989 --> 03:13.298
Bet it looks like I'm wearing rouge.

03:13.575 --> 03:15.805
I know what you meant.
And thank you.

03:16.078 --> 03:18.956
Dr Crane,
I've been meaning to ask you,

03:19.247 --> 03:22.478
what do you think about two people
who work together dating?

03:22.793 --> 03:25.591
Well, Sharon,
I'm asked that question a lot,

03:25.879 --> 03:30.634
and the stark reality is that
that situation is fraught with...

03:32.886 --> 03:35.275
...delightful possibilities.

03:35.555 --> 03:40.390
- So, are you free on Friday?
- Yes, Friday it is. After the show.

03:40.769 --> 03:43.567
- Great.
- Great.

03:47.359 --> 03:48.758
- Dr Crane?
- Yes.

03:48.986 --> 03:52.183
Clint Webber. I'm hosting
the new show on health issues.

03:52.489 --> 03:54.923
Of course. Dr Webber.
Welcome to KACL.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.078
I'm in your debt
for recommending my audition tape.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.361
Not at all. It was very good.

04:00.622 --> 04:03.898
We'd gotten tired of the
last show that was in that time slot,

04:04.209 --> 04:06.643
<i>Bert, the Backyard Gardener.</i>

04:06.920 --> 04:12.472
Rumour that his latest crop gave
new meaning to the term "potting shed".

04:12.884 --> 04:15.682
Perfect timing. Come, Clint.

04:17.221 --> 04:21.976
Roz Doyle, my producer. This is Dr Clint
Webber, the new host of <i>Health Watch.</i>

04:22.352 --> 04:24.229
- Hi.
- Hi. Great to meet you.

04:24.479 --> 04:28.028
- So, you're new.
- That's right.

04:28.358 --> 04:30.747
- And a doctor?
- That's right.

04:37.993 --> 04:40.587
I don't want to be late
for that station tour.

04:40.871 --> 04:43.339
Again, welcome aboard, Clint.

04:43.623 --> 04:46.262
Could I have acted any goofier?

04:46.543 --> 04:48.773
Not without a set of fake buck teeth.

04:49.046 --> 04:53.119
He's so handsome. I can't work with
someone that handsome. No offence.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.425
Granted,
when it comes to the looks department,

04:56.720 --> 05:00.190
- Dr Webber and I aren't in the same...
- Species?

05:02.309 --> 05:05.824
I was going to say league,
but species is so much more insulting.

05:07.773 --> 05:11.561
This stinks. The chicks are going nuts
over this Webber guy.

05:11.902 --> 05:15.133
I'm the only sex symbol around here.
Look at this.

05:15.447 --> 05:21.238
Come on. Come on, take your best shot.
No, whoa, not you. One of those guys.

05:21.662 --> 05:24.620
Bulldog, you're behaving immaturely,
even for you.

05:24.915 --> 05:26.951
There's no reason to feel threatened.

05:27.209 --> 05:30.645
I must confess, I didn't
notice he was all that handsome.

05:33.173 --> 05:36.324
You didn't notice? You of all people?

05:38.095 --> 05:40.734
Just what are you insinuating?

05:41.014 --> 05:44.086
Well, you know, that you're a little...

05:44.393 --> 05:47.624
For your information, I happen
to be a happily married man.

05:50.941 --> 05:52.932
You're married?

05:54.528 --> 05:56.564
To a woman?

05:57.280 --> 06:00.590
Of course to a woman.
You've all heard me mention Deb.

06:00.909 --> 06:04.265
How often have I said, "l must
run along. Deb will be waiting"?

06:04.579 --> 06:07.935
- We thought Deb was your cat.
- She is not a cat.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.686
She is Mrs Gilbert Leslie Chesterton,
a Sarah Lawrence graduate

06:12.004 --> 06:15.633
and the owner of a very successful
auto body repair shop.

06:17.551 --> 06:21.305
Honestly, the conclusions people make
just because a man dresses well

06:21.638 --> 06:24.277
and knows how to use a pastry bag.

06:26.601 --> 06:30.355
Well, that's the first time
I've ever seen a man "in" himself.

06:35.694 --> 06:39.528
Dad, I can't help noticing
Eddie's looking a bit glum.

06:39.865 --> 06:41.856
Yeah, he's mad at me.

06:42.117 --> 06:46.349
I gave him a can of that dog food from
your fancy gourmet place the other day.

06:46.705 --> 06:48.696
- He didn't like it?
- He loved it.

06:48.957 --> 06:50.709
Now he won't eat anything else.

06:50.959 --> 06:54.269
Even turned his nose up
at a kosher pickle and he loves those.

06:54.880 --> 06:59.351
I called all over Seattle and Frenchy's
the only one who carries that stuff.

06:59.718 --> 07:03.916
- Would you consider apologising?
- I'm never going in that store again.

07:04.264 --> 07:07.256
There is a technique of sleep feeding

07:07.559 --> 07:10.835
involving an eye dropper
and a high fructose protein shake.

07:11.146 --> 07:14.616
- I don't know about that.
- It worked on Maris.

07:15.817 --> 07:17.887
Hello, Niles, Dad.

07:18.153 --> 07:21.145
Hello, Roz. How are you doing?

07:22.074 --> 07:24.634
- Frasier, are you aware...
- Yes, I'm aware.

07:25.786 --> 07:27.902
We were taking publicity photos today.

07:28.163 --> 07:30.438
I had an allergic reaction
to the make-up.

07:30.707 --> 07:34.382
I wasn't planning on wearing any
but there's a handsome new employee.

07:34.711 --> 07:38.624
Everybody's feeling insecure.
They were all slapping their make-up on,

07:38.966 --> 07:43.084
so I, too, gave in to vanity. And like
Icarus, flying too close to the sun,

07:43.428 --> 07:46.465
- I, too, paid the price.
- Wow!

07:46.765 --> 07:50.041
I don't go to the mythology well often,
but that was spot on.

07:50.352 --> 07:52.343
No, I mean that guy. He's so handsome.

07:52.604 --> 07:55.516
- It's him. It's Dr Webber.
- Roz, that's enough.

07:55.816 --> 07:58.535
- He is striking.
- Frasier's jealous.

07:58.819 --> 08:01.379
I am not jealous.
Yes, the man is handsome.

08:01.655 --> 08:05.204
But I'm sure there's a number of areas
in which I am his superior.

08:05.534 --> 08:09.766
Good looks can be a mixed blessing.
People roll out the red carpet for you,

08:10.122 --> 08:13.910
but that robs you of any incentive
to develop other qualities.

08:14.251 --> 08:18.164
After a while you are left an ageing
Narcissus, bent at the water's edge,

08:18.505 --> 08:23.056
realising those lines
in the pond aren't ripples.

08:23.427 --> 08:26.464
- They're wrinkles.
- Amazing.

08:26.763 --> 08:31.154
- I rather liked that one myself.
- That guy could be a movie star.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.302
Roz, don't we have some work to do?

08:34.563 --> 08:38.397
- Take this table. I have a session.
- Yeah, I've got to go, too.

08:38.734 --> 08:41.885
Like Zeus riding his thunderbolt
to Mount Vesuvius.

08:42.195 --> 08:44.550
Very amusing, Dad. Off you go.

08:44.906 --> 08:46.419
Dr Crane.

08:46.658 --> 08:49.331
Dr Webber.
You remember Roz Doyle, of course?

08:49.619 --> 08:50.847
Yes, hello.

08:53.290 --> 08:55.565
Who could forget that infectious laugh?

08:55.834 --> 08:58.348
Has anyone had a look at that rash?

08:58.628 --> 09:01.779
- Yes, everybody. Yes.
- Mind if I join you?

09:02.090 --> 09:05.082
- Actually, we were just...
- We were hoping you would.

09:07.512 --> 09:11.221
So, Clint, I see that
you're a squash player.

09:11.558 --> 09:14.948
If you're up for a game,
I used to play a bit back in Harvard.

09:15.270 --> 09:18.626
I'd love to. Harvard?
I was dying to go to Harvard.

09:18.940 --> 09:21.215
I'm sure your school was just as good.

09:21.485 --> 09:24.636
- I went to Oxford.
- Even better.

09:24.946 --> 09:28.621
- Did you go to medical school there?
- Yes, but I took a year off first

09:28.950 --> 09:33.421
to get my masters in French history.
Just wanted to do something fun.

09:33.789 --> 09:35.700
So you speak French?

09:35.957 --> 09:40.667
<i>Seulement quand
je rencontre une belle femme.</i>

09:41.046 --> 09:45.085
I understand the importance of time off
before beginning medical school.

09:45.425 --> 09:50.180
I spent that summer in Milan
studying the history of opera.

09:50.555 --> 09:53.274
I had the good fortune
to become friends with

09:53.558 --> 09:57.756
a then little-known young tenor
by the name of Carreras.

09:58.105 --> 10:00.824
- José Carreras?
- Forgive the name dropping.

10:01.108 --> 10:03.906
- He's my godfather.
- You're joking.

10:04.653 --> 10:08.931
No, I'll call him tonight. He'll be
delighted to hear I'm working with you.

10:09.282 --> 10:12.354
I wonder if he remembers
the game we used to play

10:12.661 --> 10:15.971
where we pretended
not to remember one another.

10:17.749 --> 10:22.027
That rash is starting to concern me.
I'll pop and get my medical kit.

10:22.379 --> 10:24.131
There's really no need.

10:24.381 --> 10:27.930
OK, maybe we can get some work done
while he's gone.

10:28.260 --> 10:33.175
Roz, for heaven's sake. You behave
like a starry-eyed bobby-soxer.

10:33.557 --> 10:36.993
Yes, the man is good looking.
It's not like he can stop traffic.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.876
There's a blind corner out there.
We don't know if that was him.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.669
How was your squash game?

10:50.949 --> 10:55.545
Dr Webber neglected to mention that
he was squash champion back in college.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.731
- I'm sorry, Frasier.
- Not at all. It was a lovely morning.

11:00.042 --> 11:02.033
Clint treated me to breakfast.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.525
Once we arrived at Le Relais,
the chef had just cut himself.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.955
Clint not only treated the wound,

11:08.216 --> 11:11.253
but made us a flawless
egg white and truffle omelette.

11:11.553 --> 11:15.831
I put myself through med school
as a sous-chef at Le Cirque.

11:16.183 --> 11:19.016
I just want to pinch you
to make sure you're real.

11:19.311 --> 11:21.302
He's real.

11:22.230 --> 11:25.427
I'm going to get a glass of water.
I'll be right back.

11:25.734 --> 11:27.770
But you're about to start the show.

11:28.028 --> 11:31.225
I thought I'd have Clint on,
give his show a leg up.

11:31.531 --> 11:37.288
You're plugging Clint. I'm having
trouble believing this buddy-buddy act.

11:37.704 --> 11:41.583
Try as you may to insinuate I am
jealous of this man, I like Clint.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.954
Why else would I be giving a party
in his honour tonight?

11:45.253 --> 11:47.244
You're on in ten seconds.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.304
Slip on those headphones
and follow my lead.

11:52.469 --> 11:56.064
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Before we start our regular programme,

11:56.390 --> 11:59.666
I'd like to introduce you
to Dr Clint Webber.

11:59.977 --> 12:04.528
Clint, you'll probably spend a week
figuring out what all these buttons do.

12:04.898 --> 12:08.413
Actually, in college
I ran the radio station.

12:12.239 --> 12:15.390
Things may have gotten
a bit more sophisticated since then.

12:15.701 --> 12:18.340
For instance,
we have here a cough button.

12:18.620 --> 12:20.975
If I'm not mistaken,
that's the echo button.

12:21.248 --> 12:23.398
Of course it is.

12:24.918 --> 12:29.309
All my listeners are familiar
with my now trademark echoing cough.

12:31.466 --> 12:36.176
Well, let's go to the lines, take our
first call and show Dr Webber the ropes.

12:37.681 --> 12:41.117
- Go ahead, you're on the air.
- <i>Hi, Dr Crane. It's Marie.</i>

12:41.435 --> 12:44.074
Hello, Marie. I'm listening.

12:45.355 --> 12:48.904
<i>I've been having a hard time
getting out of bed every morning.</i>

12:49.234 --> 12:52.863
<i>And when I finally do,
I'm irritable for hours.</i>

12:53.196 --> 12:55.426
The desire to stay in bed

12:55.699 --> 13:00.090
is similar
to the desire to regress to the womb.

13:00.454 --> 13:03.844
Some unconscious fear
is driving you to a place of safety.

13:04.166 --> 13:06.521
You'll have to examine your life

13:06.793 --> 13:09.591
and discover what it is
you're retreating from.

13:09.880 --> 13:14.351
It's hard, but very necessary work.
It may be time to try some therapy.

13:14.718 --> 13:17.676
- <i>Wow.</i>
- You are good, Dr Crane.

13:17.971 --> 13:21.646
The thing that came to my head
was that she might be hypoglycaemic.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.853
I'd have suggested
some protein in the morning.

13:25.145 --> 13:29.696
<i>Wait a minute. Last Thursday I had eggs
for breakfast, and I felt great all day.</i>

13:30.067 --> 13:33.184
- Well, maybe that's it then.
- <i>What a relief.</i>

13:33.487 --> 13:36.047
<i>You scared the life out of me, Dr Crane.</i>

13:38.533 --> 13:40.125
Yes, well, thank you, Marie.

13:43.330 --> 13:46.720
All right, I think it's time
to say goodbye to Dr Webber now.

13:48.293 --> 13:50.249
We'll be back after these messages.

13:50.504 --> 13:52.893
- That was fun.
- Yes, it was, wasn't it?

13:53.173 --> 13:55.971
- I hope I wasn't out of line.
- No, not at all.

13:56.259 --> 13:58.898
I always enjoy learning something new.

13:59.179 --> 14:01.534
I'll see you tonight.
Don't be late.

14:01.807 --> 14:04.765
- I'm always punctual.
- Of course you are.

14:07.521 --> 14:09.512
I hate him.

14:15.696 --> 14:19.245
He's not here.
A case of that dog food, please.

14:19.574 --> 14:21.963
- Will that be all?
- Yeah, and I'm in a hurry.

14:22.244 --> 14:26.601
Look here. Nickerson's Lemon Biscuits.
These bring back memories.

14:26.957 --> 14:30.267
- Do you carry the raspberry ones?
- I'm not sure.

14:30.585 --> 14:33.463
- Can you come back for those?
- Robert?

14:35.048 --> 14:38.165
Well, look who's come back.

14:38.468 --> 14:42.302
Why don't you just let me pay for this
and get out of here? What do I owe you?

14:42.639 --> 14:44.948
I think we both know what you owe me.

14:46.435 --> 14:49.791
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have made fun of your store.

14:50.105 --> 14:52.096
Are you going to let me off the hook?

14:52.357 --> 14:55.394
I'll sell it to you.
I never like to lose a customer.

14:55.694 --> 14:57.924
While I'm here, I'll take a few cases.

14:58.196 --> 15:00.585
We have new varieties
if you'd care to look.

15:00.866 --> 15:03.141
- Sure.
- Please, show the man.

15:06.663 --> 15:09.336
I think these biscuits are mismarked.

15:10.250 --> 15:14.528
- No, that's correct.
- $14.95? For a package this small?

15:14.880 --> 15:18.714
I see we have another member
of the Price Club.

15:19.051 --> 15:22.361
There's no need for that.
Back home I can get these for 80p.

15:22.679 --> 15:27.275
- I do have to fly them over.
- Did you buy them a seat on Concorde?

15:27.643 --> 15:30.077
If you cannot afford them,
put them back.

15:30.354 --> 15:32.868
I can bloody well afford them.

15:33.148 --> 15:37.460
- This is robbery.
- Robber? No one calls me robber.

15:37.819 --> 15:39.855
- Robert?
- Not now.

15:40.113 --> 15:44.982
On your way out, a sign on the door
says "please come again". Disregard it.

15:45.369 --> 15:48.520
I'd be happy to.
Mr Crane was right about you.

15:48.830 --> 15:52.948
You're nothing but an arrogant,
swindling little cheese-monger.

15:53.293 --> 15:55.523
This is great. I'll take a case of each.

15:55.796 --> 15:57.832
You'll take a case of nothing.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.399
- What happened?
- We don't need his food.

16:00.676 --> 16:04.066
Yes, we do.
He's got tarragon flavour now.

16:04.388 --> 16:07.300
- What about Eddie?
- He'll eat when he gets hungry.

16:07.599 --> 16:10.238
For heaven sakes,
he drinks out of the toilet.

16:13.230 --> 16:16.859
So George S Kaufmann so dislikes
what the actor is doing,

16:17.192 --> 16:19.148
he sends a telegram reading,

16:19.403 --> 16:23.954
"I'm watching your performance from the
rear of the house. Wish you were here."

16:25.826 --> 16:28.659
I believe
that's the story you meant to tell.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.945
Thanks for helping out.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.843
Doc, great way to welcome the new guy.

16:35.127 --> 16:39.040
I'm surprised you're even here.
I didn't think you cared much for Clint.

16:39.381 --> 16:42.020
I'm over that.
I figured he can't nab every chick,

16:42.301 --> 16:45.896
so if we pal around,
I bag the leftovers.

16:47.347 --> 16:49.941
You're a regular busboy of romance.
Excuse me.

16:55.439 --> 16:57.236
- Niles.
- How's it going?

16:57.482 --> 17:00.599
Let me see. What have you missed?

17:00.902 --> 17:05.099
Clint told us about how he learned to
fly a plane, then he recited a sonnet.

17:05.449 --> 17:10.603
Then he fixed my ice machine and he
invented a new drink, the pink Webber.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.464
I've got Daphne
drawing a bath right now.

17:13.749 --> 17:18.027
If the party starts to lag, I can invite
him to walk on water to liven things up.

17:18.377 --> 17:20.368
Don't let it make you crazy.

17:20.631 --> 17:23.623
At some point we all run
into someone who's our superior.

17:23.925 --> 17:26.803
I've never dealt
with this sort of thing before.

17:27.095 --> 17:28.210
Never?

17:28.430 --> 17:32.981
As my younger brother, you've dealt
with this sort of thing all your life.

17:33.727 --> 17:37.003
At least he won't outshine you
in the egomania department.

17:37.314 --> 17:40.272
Sorry. Yes, I'm being silly
about this, I suppose.

17:40.567 --> 17:45.436
I just wish I could find one flaw,
one area where I'm his superior.

17:45.822 --> 17:49.861
I'm sure you will although
it won't be in the drink department.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.557
This is heaven in a glass.

17:53.580 --> 17:56.299
I was just admiring
this chessboard. It's beautiful.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.335
Thank you. Do you play?

17:58.585 --> 18:00.860
No. Are you in the middle of a match?

18:01.129 --> 18:05.486
Yes, as a matter of fact, I'm playing
by mail with a Russian grandmaster.

18:05.842 --> 18:08.561
- It's quite challenging.
- Congratulations.

18:08.845 --> 18:10.961
With your use
of the Zekrepsky Attack,

18:11.223 --> 18:14.021
you're only four moves away
from certain victory.

18:14.851 --> 18:17.968
You're right. And, actually,
I'd be happy to hear that,

18:18.271 --> 18:22.423
except I'm playing black.
Well, wasn't that a fun eight months?

18:22.776 --> 18:23.765
Excuse me.

18:27.072 --> 18:30.428
Hello, Sharon. Sorry we haven't
had a chance to speak much.

18:30.742 --> 18:33.131
I'm looking forward
to our date on Friday.

18:33.412 --> 18:37.041
So am I. You look...
absolutely beautiful.

18:37.374 --> 18:38.932
Or should I say...

18:43.547 --> 18:45.538
Why? What's so funny?

18:45.799 --> 18:48.597
You just told me
I'm as lovely as a chicken beak.

18:48.885 --> 18:50.000
Really?

18:52.681 --> 18:54.911
Who's as lovely as a chicken beak?

18:56.727 --> 18:59.082
You speak Mandarin?

19:07.946 --> 19:10.506
I just wanted to thank you
for this party.

19:10.782 --> 19:12.340
Don't mention it.

19:12.576 --> 19:16.125
It's been a perfect evening.
The hors d'oeuvres, the company,

19:16.455 --> 19:18.446
the music. I love this song.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.869
Well, enjoy.

19:33.847 --> 19:35.565
I'm sorry. I was singing too loud.

19:35.807 --> 19:39.322
No, not at all. I can't tell you
how much I'm enjoying hearing it.

19:40.562 --> 19:43.759
Careful, it doesn't take much coaxing
to get me to perform.

19:44.066 --> 19:45.101
Really?

19:45.317 --> 19:48.673
Get a glass of wine in me,
I'm serenading the entire room.

19:48.987 --> 19:50.306
Really?

19:50.530 --> 19:53.442
I'm afraid I have a bit
of the old ham in me.

19:53.742 --> 19:56.939
Would it be presumptuous to sing
in front of your guests?

19:57.245 --> 20:01.284
I think we could persuade
the piano player to play it again.

20:03.043 --> 20:06.877
Niles, I've done it.
I have found his Achilles' heel.

20:07.214 --> 20:10.012
- Whose?
- Clint's. I just heard him singing.

20:10.300 --> 20:14.054
He's tone-deaf. He's about to sing
a rendition of <i>Isn't It Romantic?</i>

20:14.388 --> 20:17.107
that will simply
peel the enamel from your teeth.

20:18.809 --> 20:21.198
Are you sure
you want to let him do that?

20:21.478 --> 20:24.436
- What do you mean?
- You're a wonderful singer.

20:24.731 --> 20:28.883
Isn't it enough to know that? Do you
need to see him humiliate himself?

20:29.820 --> 20:31.094
Yes.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.559
- Now, Frasier...
- No, you're right.

20:34.825 --> 20:37.703
I guess I am a bigger man than that.

20:37.995 --> 20:40.555
Dr Crane, your friend
Clint's quite a charmer.

20:40.831 --> 20:43.743
- Yes, he is, isn't he?
- Do you suppose he's single?

20:44.042 --> 20:46.317
I was going to give him my phone number.

20:46.586 --> 20:50.977
Excuse me, I just want to thank you all
for this warm welcome to KACL.

20:51.341 --> 20:55.380
And, as a token of my gratitude,
I'd like to share this song with you.

20:55.721 --> 21:00.556
- Clint, there's been a change in plans.
- Yes, I'm going to accompany you now.

21:00.934 --> 21:02.572
Get up.

21:17.534 --> 21:20.526
Please, everybody. Nobody's perfect.
