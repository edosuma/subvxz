WEBVTT

00:48.857 --> 00:51.318
Rachel, let me see.

00:57.407 --> 01:00.535
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

01:00.702 --> 01:02.245
In my garden.

01:03.955 --> 01:05.790
Finders keepers.

01:12.756 --> 01:14.257
Bruce?

01:19.262 --> 01:20.972
Bruce?

01:23.308 --> 01:25.769
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

01:48.708 --> 01:50.877
Did you have dream?

01:51.336 --> 01:53.213
Nightmare.

01:57.592 --> 01:59.052
Worse than this place?

02:21.074 --> 02:23.034
They are going to fight you.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.036
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.040
Can they kill me before breakfast?

02:31.418 --> 02:34.254
You are in hell, little man.

02:37.549 --> 02:40.343
And I am the devil.

02:43.722 --> 02:45.181
You're not the devil.

02:45.348 --> 02:46.725
You're practice.

03:30.185 --> 03:31.478
Solitary.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.563
- Why?
- For protection.

03:34.272 --> 03:36.608
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

03:40.278 --> 03:42.280
Get in.

03:46.242 --> 03:48.286
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

03:48.453 --> 03:51.122
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

03:52.374 --> 03:56.294
Actually, there were seven of them.

03:56.461 --> 03:58.755
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

04:02.509 --> 04:03.760
How do you know my name?

04:03.927 --> 04:06.972
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

04:07.138 --> 04:09.474
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

04:09.641 --> 04:10.809
Who are you?

04:10.976 --> 04:14.145
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

04:14.312 --> 04:17.940
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

04:18.108 --> 04:19.692
A man who can offer you a path.

04:20.610 --> 04:23.113
What makes you think I need a path?

04:23.488 --> 04:26.116
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

04:26.283 --> 04:28.660
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

04:28.827 --> 04:31.288
...but whatever
your original intentions...

04:31.997 --> 04:35.333
...you have become truly lost.

04:36.876 --> 04:40.672
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

04:40.839 --> 04:44.843
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

04:45.010 --> 04:48.221
...and wishes to serve true justice.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.807
The path of the League of Shadows.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.187
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

04:56.354 --> 05:00.525
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

05:00.692 --> 05:04.362
He can be destroyed or locked up.

05:05.739 --> 05:10.535
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

05:10.702 --> 05:13.705
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

05:13.872 --> 05:16.374
...and if they can't stop you...

05:16.750 --> 05:19.210
...then you become
something else entirely.

05:20.879 --> 05:22.422
Which is?

05:22.922 --> 05:25.884
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

05:27.218 --> 05:28.845
Tomorrow, you will be released.

05:29.012 --> 05:32.390
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

05:32.557 --> 05:36.061
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

05:36.227 --> 05:37.896
Pick one of these flowers.

05:38.063 --> 05:41.024
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

05:41.191 --> 05:44.110
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

05:44.277 --> 05:47.030
And what was I looking for?

05:48.740 --> 05:50.700
Only you can know that.

06:57.851 --> 07:01.479
You turn back. You go back.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.091
Ra's al Ghul?

08:21.309 --> 08:22.894
Wait.

08:25.897 --> 08:27.190
What are you seeking?

08:28.108 --> 08:30.110
I seek...

08:31.653 --> 08:33.905
...the means to fight injustice.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.408
To turn fear...

08:36.741 --> 08:39.577
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

09:01.266 --> 09:04.352
To manipulate the fears in others...

09:05.186 --> 09:08.607
...you must first master your own.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.942
Are you ready to begin?

09:11.860 --> 09:14.446
I can... I can barely stand.

09:14.613 --> 09:16.948
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

09:17.115 --> 09:20.285
Death is not considerate or fair!

09:20.785 --> 09:25.415
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

09:29.294 --> 09:30.629
Tiger.

09:32.255 --> 09:34.049
Jujitsu.

09:36.259 --> 09:37.302
Panther.

09:40.805 --> 09:43.141
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

09:48.605 --> 09:50.148
And you are afraid.

09:53.109 --> 09:54.986
But not of me.

09:58.448 --> 10:00.951
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

10:05.455 --> 10:08.625
...what do you fear?

10:17.759 --> 10:19.177
Bruce?

10:21.846 --> 10:24.349
It's okay. It's okay.

10:24.516 --> 10:26.017
You'll be okay.

10:26.268 --> 10:28.561
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

10:28.728 --> 10:31.731
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.149
Very good, sir.

10:33.608 --> 10:37.320
- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
- Don't worry. It's fine.

10:39.614 --> 10:41.574
Took quite a fall, didn't we,
Master Bruce?

10:41.741 --> 10:43.034
And why do we fall, Bruce?

10:43.368 --> 10:46.454
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.086
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

11:02.053 --> 11:03.888
The bats again?

11:07.058 --> 11:09.185
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

11:09.686 --> 11:12.731
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

11:12.897 --> 11:14.899
All creatures feel fear.

11:15.066 --> 11:16.401
Even the scary ones?

11:16.568 --> 11:18.445
Especially the scary ones.

11:18.820 --> 11:20.614
I got something to show you.

11:24.909 --> 11:28.246
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

11:28.913 --> 11:31.082
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

11:31.249 --> 11:32.876
No going back to bed.

11:36.087 --> 11:38.214
Did you build this train, Dad?

11:38.381 --> 11:43.094
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

11:43.261 --> 11:46.765
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

11:46.932 --> 11:50.894
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

11:51.061 --> 11:52.771
And at the center...

11:52.938 --> 11:54.773
...Wayne Tower.

11:54.940 --> 11:57.817
- Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

11:57.984 --> 12:01.196
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

12:01.363 --> 12:03.239
- Better?
- Well...

12:03.406 --> 12:05.659
...more interested men.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.466
Can we go?

13:05.844 --> 13:07.345
Please.

13:07.929 --> 13:09.973
Okay. Let's go.

13:19.190 --> 13:22.068
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.362
I just needed some fresh air.

13:24.529 --> 13:27.699
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

13:30.327 --> 13:33.038
Come on. Let's go.

13:38.501 --> 13:40.253
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.796
- That's fine.
- Fast.

13:41.963 --> 13:43.548
Take it easy.

13:44.215 --> 13:45.759
Take it easy.

13:46.551 --> 13:48.011
Here you go.

13:50.764 --> 13:53.600
It's fine. It's fine.

13:54.476 --> 13:57.604
Now just take it and go.

13:57.771 --> 13:59.564
- I said, jewelry.
- Hey...

14:01.608 --> 14:02.943
Thomas!

14:10.951 --> 14:12.577
Bruce.

14:15.205 --> 14:16.581
It's okay.

14:19.751 --> 14:21.461
Don't be afraid.

14:53.285 --> 14:55.078
Is this your father's?

14:56.621 --> 14:58.748
It's okay.

14:59.958 --> 15:01.584
Come here.

15:04.296 --> 15:06.506
There you go.

15:09.634 --> 15:11.636
It's okay.

15:13.388 --> 15:15.307
It's okay.

15:19.311 --> 15:20.812
Gordon.

15:28.903 --> 15:30.488
Hey.

15:31.114 --> 15:32.324
Good news.

15:33.783 --> 15:35.660
We got him, son.

15:56.306 --> 15:58.183
You're in excellent hands.

15:58.350 --> 16:00.018
We'll be watching the empire.

16:00.185 --> 16:03.188
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

16:19.204 --> 16:22.332
I thought I might prepare
a little supper.

16:27.504 --> 16:29.589
- Very well.
- Alfred?

16:33.551 --> 16:35.553
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.389
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

16:37.555 --> 16:40.600
- lf I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

16:41.726 --> 16:45.063
It was him, and him alone.

16:45.563 --> 16:47.065
Do you understand?

16:50.193 --> 16:53.238
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

16:53.405 --> 16:55.407
So do I, Master Bruce.

16:57.826 --> 16:59.077
So do I.

17:01.204 --> 17:04.165
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

17:04.332 --> 17:06.459
My anger outweighs my guilt.

17:07.210 --> 17:08.586
Come.

17:13.258 --> 17:15.969
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

17:16.136 --> 17:19.180
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

17:21.683 --> 17:26.646
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

17:27.896 --> 17:29.774
You know how to disappear.

17:29.941 --> 17:32.152
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

17:33.778 --> 17:35.488
Invisible?

17:39.492 --> 17:44.122
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

17:57.093 --> 17:58.803
Always mind your surroundings.

18:01.973 --> 18:04.184
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.938
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

18:08.104 --> 18:10.440
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

18:10.899 --> 18:13.944
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

18:16.237 --> 18:18.365
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.785
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

18:21.952 --> 18:24.245
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

18:24.412 --> 18:26.831
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

18:26.998 --> 18:30.961
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

18:35.006 --> 18:37.842
Your parents' death
was not your fault.

18:46.184 --> 18:47.435
It was your father's.

19:08.331 --> 19:11.167
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

19:11.334 --> 19:13.545
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

19:14.337 --> 19:15.547
I've had training.

19:15.714 --> 19:17.549
The training is nothing!

19:17.716 --> 19:19.384
Will is everything!

19:25.181 --> 19:27.017
The will to act.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.028
Yield.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.738
You haven't beaten me.

19:39.904 --> 19:42.616
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

19:50.248 --> 19:52.042
Rub your chest.

19:52.542 --> 19:55.420
Your arms will
take care of themselves.

19:58.089 --> 19:59.716
You are stronger than your father.

20:00.383 --> 20:02.010
You didn't know my father.

20:02.177 --> 20:04.471
But I know the rage that drives you.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.932
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

20:07.098 --> 20:09.768
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

20:09.935 --> 20:11.937
...poison in your veins.

20:12.103 --> 20:16.566
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

20:17.984 --> 20:20.445
...so you'd be spared your pain.

20:23.448 --> 20:26.826
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

20:28.453 --> 20:30.497
Once, I had a wife.

20:31.456 --> 20:33.375
My great love.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.670
She was taken from me.

20:36.836 --> 20:40.048
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

20:40.215 --> 20:43.510
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

20:45.303 --> 20:47.639
Your anger gives you great power.

20:48.139 --> 20:51.685
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

20:52.227 --> 20:54.145
...as it almost did me.

20:54.312 --> 20:57.023
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.150
That's no help to me.

20:59.317 --> 21:01.152
Why, Bruce?

21:01.319 --> 21:03.989
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

21:07.826 --> 21:11.288
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

21:11.454 --> 21:14.124
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

21:14.291 --> 21:16.501
I'm not heading back at all.

21:16.668 --> 21:18.712
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

21:19.129 --> 21:21.923
They just don't feel the same way.

21:22.716 --> 21:26.386
- I've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.971
My room will be fine.

21:28.138 --> 21:30.682
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

21:30.849 --> 21:32.684
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

21:32.851 --> 21:35.228
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

21:35.395 --> 21:38.440
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

21:38.607 --> 21:42.694
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

21:42.861 --> 21:45.572
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

21:46.406 --> 21:50.285
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

21:50.952 --> 21:53.121
...for what was
most precious to him...

21:53.288 --> 21:55.540
...in the whole world.

21:57.500 --> 22:01.046
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

22:01.212 --> 22:03.256
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

22:03.423 --> 22:06.885
Should I just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

22:07.052 --> 22:10.138
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

22:10.305 --> 22:14.351
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

22:15.727 --> 22:17.228
Haven't given up on me yet?

22:17.896 --> 22:19.397
Never.

23:07.946 --> 23:11.366
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

23:12.242 --> 23:14.160
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

23:14.327 --> 23:15.620
Old habits die hard, I guess.

23:15.996 --> 23:18.581
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

23:18.748 --> 23:20.625
How's your mom?

23:21.042 --> 23:23.295
She misses this place.

23:24.796 --> 23:26.298
So do I.

23:26.715 --> 23:27.966
Yeah.

23:28.133 --> 23:31.136
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

23:31.303 --> 23:34.306
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

23:34.472 --> 23:38.018
- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

23:41.646 --> 23:45.817
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

23:46.151 --> 23:49.654
Someone at this proceeding...

23:50.322 --> 23:52.490
...should stand for my parents.

23:52.657 --> 23:54.784
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

23:54.951 --> 23:58.163
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

23:59.539 --> 24:02.792
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

24:02.959 --> 24:06.630
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

24:06.796 --> 24:09.466
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

24:11.468 --> 24:13.178
I cannot let that pass.

24:13.345 --> 24:16.222
And I need you
to understand that, please.

24:17.974 --> 24:19.184
Okay.

24:20.268 --> 24:23.605
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

24:23.772 --> 24:26.983
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

24:27.317 --> 24:28.985
...but by desperation.

24:29.152 --> 24:33.073
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

24:33.239 --> 24:35.867
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

24:36.034 --> 24:39.162
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

24:40.163 --> 24:42.457
Mr. Chill?

24:46.044 --> 24:47.712
Your Honor...

24:48.588 --> 24:51.716
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

24:54.344 --> 24:57.597
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

24:57.764 --> 25:00.100
...but that don't change what I did.

25:03.728 --> 25:08.400
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

25:08.566 --> 25:10.860
Has he got anything to say?

25:25.583 --> 25:28.420
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

25:38.096 --> 25:39.389
Bruce Wayne!

25:42.225 --> 25:43.435
Joe! Hey, Joe!

25:43.602 --> 25:45.103
Falcone says hi.

25:55.447 --> 25:59.034
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

25:59.784 --> 26:01.328
I do.

26:06.458 --> 26:08.460
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden...

26:08.627 --> 26:10.462
...insisted on making the hearing public.

26:10.629 --> 26:13.048
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

26:13.256 --> 26:14.507
Maybe I should thank them.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.260
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

26:17.427 --> 26:19.346
My parents deserved justice.

26:19.512 --> 26:22.432
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

26:22.599 --> 26:25.477
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

26:25.644 --> 26:29.230
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

26:29.397 --> 26:32.692
- It's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

26:39.783 --> 26:42.619
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

26:43.036 --> 26:44.496
This city is rotting.

26:44.663 --> 26:47.457
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

26:47.624 --> 26:49.125
Things are worse than ever here.

26:49.292 --> 26:51.836
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

26:52.003 --> 26:54.965
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

26:55.131 --> 26:57.676
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

26:58.301 --> 27:00.804
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

27:05.350 --> 27:08.228
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

27:10.105 --> 27:13.149
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

27:13.316 --> 27:15.402
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

27:15.568 --> 27:19.864
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

27:20.031 --> 27:23.743
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

27:24.619 --> 27:28.039
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

27:30.292 --> 27:33.336
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

27:34.129 --> 27:35.714
Now I can't.

27:51.605 --> 27:53.315
Your father would be ashamed of you.

28:36.775 --> 28:39.277
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

28:39.736 --> 28:41.613
No gun? I'm insulted.

28:44.783 --> 28:48.578
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

28:48.745 --> 28:51.498
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

28:51.665 --> 28:53.291
Only those who know me, kid.

28:53.625 --> 28:56.127
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

28:56.461 --> 28:59.297
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

28:59.714 --> 29:01.341
...and a judge.

29:01.508 --> 29:05.804
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

29:05.971 --> 29:08.682
Now, that's power you can't buy.

29:09.307 --> 29:10.767
That's the power of fear.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.435
I'm not afraid of you.

29:12.602 --> 29:14.521
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

29:14.688 --> 29:16.356
But you haven't thought it through.

29:16.523 --> 29:19.609
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

29:19.776 --> 29:22.195
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

29:26.324 --> 29:28.660
People from your world...

29:28.827 --> 29:31.204
...have so much to lose.

29:31.371 --> 29:35.709
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

29:35.875 --> 29:38.837
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

29:39.004 --> 29:41.131
You've never tasted desperate.

29:41.298 --> 29:43.842
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

29:44.009 --> 29:47.429
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

29:47.596 --> 29:51.891
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.185
This is a world
you'll never understand.

29:54.352 --> 29:56.354
And you always fear...

29:56.521 --> 29:58.982
...what you don't understand.

30:01.860 --> 30:03.236
All right.

30:10.869 --> 30:13.705
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

30:13.872 --> 30:15.874
More than your old man anyway.

30:16.041 --> 30:20.337
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

30:20.503 --> 30:22.714
He said your father begged for mercy.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.842
Begged.

30:26.009 --> 30:27.385
Like a dog.

30:40.231 --> 30:42.025
Should've tipped better.

30:52.035 --> 30:53.870
- For what?
- Your jacket.

30:54.412 --> 30:56.039
Okay.

30:57.123 --> 31:00.585
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

31:00.752 --> 31:02.879
Be careful who sees you with that.

31:03.463 --> 31:05.382
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

31:05.840 --> 31:07.550
Everyone.

31:09.844 --> 31:11.596
It's...

31:11.763 --> 31:13.765
It's a nice coat.

31:32.075 --> 31:36.454
When you lived among the criminals,
did you start to pity them?

31:36.621 --> 31:40.292
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn 't starve, yes.

31:40.500 --> 31:45.964
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

31:47.257 --> 31:49.342
And when I traveled...

31:49.509 --> 31:52.220
...I learned the fear before a crime...

31:52.971 --> 31:55.557
...and the thrill of success.

31:57.434 --> 31:59.311
But I never became one of them.

32:02.772 --> 32:05.692
Fool. What do I care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

32:07.152 --> 32:08.945
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

32:12.157 --> 32:16.119
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

32:18.204 --> 32:22.334
But a criminal is not complicated.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.837
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

32:26.004 --> 32:28.548
You fear your own power.

32:28.715 --> 32:30.008
You fear your anger...

32:30.467 --> 32:34.721
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

32:34.888 --> 32:38.350
Now you must journey inwards.

32:42.103 --> 32:44.189
You are ready.

32:45.190 --> 32:46.608
Breathe.

32:56.159 --> 32:58.036
Breathe.

33:03.041 --> 33:04.876
Breathe in your fears.

33:07.504 --> 33:08.546
Face them.

33:10.048 --> 33:12.842
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

33:13.009 --> 33:16.388
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

33:17.847 --> 33:21.268
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

33:38.493 --> 33:41.371
You have to become a terrible thought.

33:45.917 --> 33:47.127
A wraith.

33:52.841 --> 33:55.218
You have to become an idea!

34:02.100 --> 34:05.145
Feel terror cloud your senses.

34:06.896 --> 34:10.108
Feel its power to distort.

34:11.067 --> 34:13.277
To control.

34:16.364 --> 34:20.159
And know that this power
can be yours.

34:32.714 --> 34:35.382
Embrace your worst fear.

34:42.389 --> 34:44.684
Become one with the darkness.

35:04.496 --> 35:06.206
Focus.

35:06.498 --> 35:08.667
Concentrate.

35:08.833 --> 35:10.961
Master your senses.

35:39.030 --> 35:41.491
You cannot leave any sign.

35:41.866 --> 35:43.076
I haven't.

35:51.376 --> 35:53.378
Impressive.

36:02.846 --> 36:04.556
We have purged your fear.

36:05.724 --> 36:07.350
You are ready to lead these men.

36:07.517 --> 36:11.062
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

36:13.690 --> 36:17.861
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

36:34.586 --> 36:35.962
No.

36:37.422 --> 36:38.715
I'm no executioner.

36:39.257 --> 36:42.928
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

36:43.303 --> 36:45.597
That's why it's so important.

36:45.847 --> 36:47.599
It separates us from them.

36:47.766 --> 36:50.143
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

36:50.310 --> 36:52.103
- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

36:52.270 --> 36:53.980
Corrupt bureaucrats?

36:54.147 --> 36:56.650
Criminals mock society's laws.

36:56.816 --> 36:59.110
You know this better than most.

36:59.986 --> 37:02.614
You cannot lead these men...

37:02.781 --> 37:06.785
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

37:07.369 --> 37:09.788
And where would I be leading
these men?

37:10.330 --> 37:11.623
Gotham.

37:11.790 --> 37:13.833
As Gotham's favored son...

37:14.000 --> 37:18.338
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

37:18.713 --> 37:22.467
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

37:22.634 --> 37:25.971
Like Constantinople
or Rome before it...

37:26.137 --> 37:30.350
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

37:30.517 --> 37:34.145
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

37:34.312 --> 37:39.484
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

37:39.776 --> 37:42.862
It is one we've performed
for centuries.

37:43.196 --> 37:44.948
Gotham...

37:45.115 --> 37:47.993
...must be destroyed.

37:51.329 --> 37:52.831
You can't believe in this.

37:53.039 --> 37:57.586
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

37:57.752 --> 38:02.173
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

38:02.382 --> 38:05.719
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

38:05.885 --> 38:08.471
...but I will not
become an executioner.

38:08.638 --> 38:10.181
Bruce, please.

38:10.348 --> 38:13.184
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

38:45.550 --> 38:48.094
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

41:04.522 --> 41:07.651
I will tell him you saved his life.

41:26.378 --> 41:28.922
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

41:29.089 --> 41:31.383
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

41:32.884 --> 41:34.386
Apart from the mud.

41:34.636 --> 41:37.305
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

41:37.472 --> 41:38.723
As long as it takes.

41:38.890 --> 41:40.392
I want to show the people...

41:40.558 --> 41:43.979
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

41:44.145 --> 41:47.357
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

41:47.524 --> 41:48.733
...combating poverty.

41:48.942 --> 41:53.446
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

41:53.738 --> 41:55.365
Did it?

41:56.491 --> 41:57.951
In a way.

41:58.118 --> 42:01.204
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

42:03.206 --> 42:06.251
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

42:06.418 --> 42:08.086
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

42:08.253 --> 42:09.796
As a man...

42:09.963 --> 42:12.382
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

42:12.549 --> 42:14.467
But as a symbol...

42:15.927 --> 42:18.597
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

42:18.763 --> 42:21.391
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

42:21.975 --> 42:24.644
Something elemental...

42:24.811 --> 42:26.438
...something terrifying.

42:26.605 --> 42:28.732
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

42:28.898 --> 42:34.029
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

42:34.195 --> 42:35.572
You're thinking about Rachel?

42:35.739 --> 42:38.116
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

42:40.118 --> 42:41.870
Have you told anyone
I'm coming back?

42:42.078 --> 42:46.291
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

42:46.458 --> 42:48.335
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

42:48.501 --> 42:49.794
You had me declared dead?

42:49.961 --> 42:52.839
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

42:53.006 --> 42:55.258
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

42:55.467 --> 42:57.802
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

42:57.969 --> 43:00.680
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

43:01.222 --> 43:02.849
Quite so, sir.

43:03.016 --> 43:06.770
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

43:16.738 --> 43:21.451
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

43:21.827 --> 43:26.415
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

43:28.709 --> 43:31.294
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.

43:31.461 --> 43:34.756
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

43:34.923 --> 43:37.592
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

43:37.759 --> 43:40.846
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

43:41.013 --> 43:42.431
...and moved into your asylum.

43:42.639 --> 43:47.269
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

43:48.812 --> 43:50.814
Or the corrupt.

43:53.066 --> 43:54.651
Mr. Finch.

43:54.985 --> 43:56.778
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

43:56.945 --> 44:01.325
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

44:05.287 --> 44:07.622
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?

44:07.789 --> 44:09.166
Looking out for you.

44:11.668 --> 44:14.588
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

44:14.755 --> 44:16.798
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

44:16.965 --> 44:20.677
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

44:20.844 --> 44:22.137
That's sweet.

44:27.559 --> 44:29.936
We've been through all that.

44:56.004 --> 44:57.464
Blessed bat again, sir.

44:57.923 --> 45:00.342
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

46:58.210 --> 47:00.921
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

47:01.088 --> 47:04.049
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

47:04.216 --> 47:05.592
I'm bringing in the shipments.

47:06.301 --> 47:07.511
We are paying you for that.

47:07.678 --> 47:10.180
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

47:12.683 --> 47:17.479
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

47:17.646 --> 47:20.732
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

47:20.899 --> 47:22.818
He... He's coming to Gotham?

47:22.984 --> 47:24.444
Yes, he is.

47:24.611 --> 47:27.072
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

47:27.239 --> 47:32.327
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

47:33.328 --> 47:36.665
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

47:37.165 --> 47:38.959
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

47:40.085 --> 47:42.004
Idealist, huh?

47:42.170 --> 47:43.880
Well, there's an answer to that too.

47:44.256 --> 47:47.217
- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

47:51.388 --> 47:54.850
No, we are showing very healthy growth
in these sectors.

47:55.017 --> 47:58.186
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

47:58.353 --> 48:00.522
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

48:01.898 --> 48:05.694
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

48:06.028 --> 48:09.197
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

48:09.364 --> 48:12.200
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

48:12.367 --> 48:14.244
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

48:14.411 --> 48:17.706
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

48:17.873 --> 48:21.209
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

48:21.376 --> 48:22.878
Name?

48:23.337 --> 48:25.005
Bruce Wayne.

48:26.882 --> 48:30.385
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

48:30.552 --> 48:34.639
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

48:35.349 --> 48:36.892
Jessica?

48:37.976 --> 48:40.520
Jessica? Where are you?

48:40.687 --> 48:44.941
- Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?

48:45.609 --> 48:48.779
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

48:49.112 --> 48:51.615
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

48:51.782 --> 48:53.742
I'm sorry to disappoint.

48:53.909 --> 48:56.620
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

48:56.912 --> 48:58.455
- Who?
- Wayne.

48:58.789 --> 49:00.874
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

49:04.795 --> 49:07.714
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

49:07.881 --> 49:09.132
Too many wheels turning.

49:09.299 --> 49:11.301
- We're going public.
- I understand.

49:11.760 --> 49:14.596
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

49:14.763 --> 49:17.307
I'm not looking to interfere.

49:17.766 --> 49:19.893
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

49:20.060 --> 49:23.105
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

49:23.438 --> 49:25.190
Any ideas where you would start?

49:25.691 --> 49:28.068
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

49:28.443 --> 49:30.153
Fox's department.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.322
I'll let him know you're coming.

49:33.240 --> 49:35.993
You look like him. Your dad.

49:36.785 --> 49:39.454
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

49:39.621 --> 49:43.583
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

49:43.917 --> 49:48.422
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

49:48.922 --> 49:51.633
All prototypes. None in production.

49:51.800 --> 49:54.469
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

49:55.470 --> 49:57.305
What did they tell you this place was?

49:57.472 --> 49:59.516
They didn't tell me anything.

50:01.977 --> 50:05.439
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

50:05.897 --> 50:07.357
Dead end.

50:07.524 --> 50:10.861
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

50:11.820 --> 50:13.322
Come on.

50:13.488 --> 50:15.949
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

50:16.116 --> 50:17.993
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.828
Helped him build his train.

50:20.412 --> 50:22.039
Here we are.

50:25.709 --> 50:27.336
Kevlar utility harness.

50:27.711 --> 50:29.671
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

50:29.838 --> 50:32.174
The 350-pound test monofilament.

50:35.510 --> 50:37.679
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

50:38.180 --> 50:42.809
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

50:42.976 --> 50:46.188
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

50:46.396 --> 50:49.024
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

50:50.901 --> 50:53.028
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

50:53.236 --> 50:55.989
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

50:56.323 --> 50:58.700
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

50:58.867 --> 51:01.078
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

51:01.244 --> 51:04.122
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

51:04.289 --> 51:06.667
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

51:07.751 --> 51:11.213
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

51:11.880 --> 51:13.382
I want to borrow it.

51:13.548 --> 51:15.342
For spelunking.

51:16.218 --> 51:17.511
Spelunking?

51:17.678 --> 51:19.388
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

51:20.681 --> 51:23.350
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

51:25.686 --> 51:28.939
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

51:29.106 --> 51:30.357
Mr. Wayne...

51:30.565 --> 51:32.484
...the way I see it...

51:32.943 --> 51:35.404
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

51:38.365 --> 51:40.867
Okay. Give it a try.

51:44.997 --> 51:46.248
Charming.

51:49.084 --> 51:50.877
At least you'll have company.

51:52.754 --> 51:56.758
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

52:09.229 --> 52:13.400
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

52:13.567 --> 52:16.570
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

52:16.737 --> 52:20.449
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

52:33.128 --> 52:35.297
Alfred! Come up here!

52:35.505 --> 52:38.467
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

52:58.487 --> 53:01.156
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

53:01.323 --> 53:02.824
Via a dummy corporation.

53:02.991 --> 53:04.826
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

53:04.993 --> 53:09.956
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

53:10.499 --> 53:13.460
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

53:13.627 --> 53:17.673
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

53:17.839 --> 53:20.384
- How large?
- Say 10,000.

53:22.886 --> 53:25.806
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

53:42.906 --> 53:44.992
Don't suppose you want a taste.

53:45.158 --> 53:48.328
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

53:48.495 --> 53:50.664
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

53:50.831 --> 53:54.209
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

53:54.376 --> 53:56.211
I'm no rat.

53:58.964 --> 54:02.676
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

54:32.372 --> 54:34.499
Don't turn around.

54:35.083 --> 54:38.170
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

54:38.837 --> 54:39.963
What do you want?

54:40.130 --> 54:43.300
Carmine Falcone brings in
shipments of drugs every week.

54:43.467 --> 54:45.260
Nobody takes him down. Why?

54:46.678 --> 54:48.805
He's paid up with the right people.

54:49.097 --> 54:51.892
What will it take to bring him down?

54:52.601 --> 54:55.020
Leverage on Judge Faden...

54:55.729 --> 54:58.106
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

54:58.523 --> 55:00.150
Rachel Dawes.

55:00.734 --> 55:01.860
Who are you?

55:02.277 --> 55:03.904
Watch for my sign.

55:06.573 --> 55:08.617
You're just one man?

55:09.034 --> 55:10.452
Now we're two.

55:12.579 --> 55:14.164
We?

55:29.805 --> 55:31.556
Freeze!

55:48.740 --> 55:50.659
What the hell was that?

55:53.578 --> 55:54.788
Just some nut.

55:58.208 --> 56:01.003
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

56:01.169 --> 56:03.672
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

56:04.256 --> 56:05.882
BASE-jumping.

56:06.466 --> 56:09.011
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

56:10.220 --> 56:13.015
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

56:13.181 --> 56:15.851
You know,
I think I have just the thing.

56:17.185 --> 56:19.646
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

56:22.983 --> 56:24.860
Regularly flexible...

56:25.277 --> 56:27.404
...but put a current through it...

56:28.864 --> 56:32.576
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

56:32.743 --> 56:35.871
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

56:36.038 --> 56:37.247
Too expensive for the Army?

56:37.414 --> 56:42.169
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

56:42.336 --> 56:44.129
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?

56:44.796 --> 56:46.173
If you're uncomfortable...

56:46.340 --> 56:49.551
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

56:49.718 --> 56:51.678
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

56:53.430 --> 56:56.016
But don't think of me as an idiot.

56:57.517 --> 56:59.478
Fair enough.

57:01.396 --> 57:03.231
What's that?

57:05.317 --> 57:07.235
The Tumbler?

57:07.736 --> 57:09.696
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

57:15.702 --> 57:17.621
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

57:19.623 --> 57:24.044
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

57:26.588 --> 57:30.217
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

57:30.425 --> 57:32.969
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

57:35.806 --> 57:37.933
Not... Not now, sir.

57:40.769 --> 57:42.646
Afterburner disengaged.

57:43.021 --> 57:46.066
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

57:46.233 --> 57:47.943
...but this baby works just fine.

57:57.494 --> 57:58.745
So, what do you think?

57:59.997 --> 58:01.999
Does it come in black?

58:02.624 --> 58:05.002
I need you at the docks Thursday.

58:05.252 --> 58:07.129
- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

58:07.295 --> 58:09.423
...with the last shipment.
- Sure.

58:11.008 --> 58:14.678
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

58:14.845 --> 58:17.264
- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

58:17.431 --> 58:20.142
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

58:20.308 --> 58:22.269
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

58:22.728 --> 58:23.979
Have you seen the girl?

58:24.479 --> 58:27.149
It's a cute little assistant D A.

58:27.316 --> 58:30.986
Don 't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

58:31.153 --> 58:34.489
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

58:34.656 --> 58:37.492
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

58:37.659 --> 58:40.287
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

58:44.166 --> 58:45.959
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

58:46.168 --> 58:48.837
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

58:49.004 --> 58:51.590
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

58:51.757 --> 58:57.387
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

59:34.383 --> 59:36.426
Why bats, Master Wayne?

59:36.677 --> 59:37.928
Bats frighten me.

59:39.221 --> 59:41.515
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

01:00:08.208 --> 01:00:10.127
What is this?

01:00:13.922 --> 01:00:15.257
Continue.

01:00:20.762 --> 01:00:22.431
Looks fine out there.

01:00:22.848 --> 01:00:24.766
The bears go straight to the dealers.

01:00:24.933 --> 01:00:27.602
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

01:00:27.769 --> 01:00:30.772
- What's the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

01:00:30.939 --> 01:00:34.109
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

01:00:49.958 --> 01:00:52.961
Hey. Steiss.

01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:15.734
Steiss?

01:01:27.663 --> 01:01:29.289
What?

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.500
What the...?

01:01:40.509 --> 01:01:42.344
I better check it.

01:01:54.898 --> 01:01:56.900
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

01:02:26.221 --> 01:02:27.848
Where are you?!

01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:29.057
Here.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.415
Get going. Oh, shit.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.727
What the hell are you?

01:03:16.772 --> 01:03:17.939
I'm Batman.

01:03:26.281 --> 01:03:28.241
Nice coat.

01:03:29.951 --> 01:03:31.495
Thanks.

01:04:12.536 --> 01:04:13.787
Hold it.

01:04:15.914 --> 01:04:18.375
That's right, you better run.

01:04:27.342 --> 01:04:29.177
Falcone sent them to kill you.

01:04:30.303 --> 01:04:32.889
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

01:04:36.685 --> 01:04:38.228
- What's this?
- Leverage.

01:04:38.395 --> 01:04:40.022
- For what?
- To get things moving.

01:04:40.314 --> 01:04:42.316
Who are you?

01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:43.942
Someone like you.

01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:46.153
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:54.745
Ma'am? Everything okay?

01:04:59.041 --> 01:05:01.543
- Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:04.004
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

01:05:04.212 --> 01:05:06.340
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

01:05:19.394 --> 01:05:21.229
What the hell is that?

01:05:30.822 --> 01:05:32.074
Cut him down.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.931
Unacceptable.

01:05:56.098 --> 01:05:58.934
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

01:05:59.101 --> 01:06:01.061
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

01:06:01.311 --> 01:06:03.647
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

01:06:03.814 --> 01:06:06.400
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

01:06:06.566 --> 01:06:09.277
It was some asshole in a costume.

01:06:09.778 --> 01:06:11.446
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

01:06:11.613 --> 01:06:14.408
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

01:06:14.574 --> 01:06:18.078
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

01:06:18.245 --> 01:06:19.454
Understand?

01:06:19.746 --> 01:06:22.207
- No way to bury it now.
- There's still Judge Faden.

01:06:22.374 --> 01:06:25.460
- I've got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?

01:06:25.627 --> 01:06:28.755
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

01:06:28.922 --> 01:06:31.091
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

01:06:31.258 --> 01:06:34.469
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

01:06:34.886 --> 01:06:36.430
Okay. Let's do it.

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:41.977
- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

01:06:42.144 --> 01:06:45.564
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

01:06:46.606 --> 01:06:49.484
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

01:06:50.819 --> 01:06:53.238
Your theatrics made an impression.

01:06:54.614 --> 01:06:57.659
Theatricality and deception...

01:06:57.826 --> 01:07:01.038
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

01:07:01.204 --> 01:07:03.999
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

01:07:04.166 --> 01:07:07.002
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

01:07:07.336 --> 01:07:08.670
Polo, for instance.

01:07:08.837 --> 01:07:10.505
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

01:07:10.756 --> 01:07:14.426
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

01:07:14.593 --> 01:07:16.053
These things beg the question...

01:07:16.219 --> 01:07:20.474
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.225
What does someone like me do?

01:07:23.185 --> 01:07:27.397
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

01:07:28.065 --> 01:07:29.650
Buy things that are not for sale.

01:07:29.816 --> 01:07:33.362
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

01:07:33.987 --> 01:07:35.989
...you might even have a little
by accident.

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.160
Sir.

01:07:40.327 --> 01:07:42.663
- We have a situation.
- All right.

01:07:43.038 --> 01:07:46.875
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

01:07:47.417 --> 01:07:52.214
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

01:07:54.257 --> 01:07:56.635
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

01:07:56.843 --> 01:07:58.637
It's a microwave emitter.

01:07:58.804 --> 01:08:01.765
It's designed for desert warfare,
but it...

01:08:03.433 --> 01:08:05.018
It looks like somebody...

01:08:09.398 --> 01:08:10.899
...turned it on.

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:19.533
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

01:08:27.457 --> 01:08:30.419
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

01:08:30.585 --> 01:08:33.587
The weapon itself is...

01:08:34.881 --> 01:08:36.383
Missing?

01:08:37.216 --> 01:08:38.468
Yeah.

01:08:39.761 --> 01:08:41.721
Mr. Wayne.

01:08:45.434 --> 01:08:46.893
Nice car.

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:48.437
You should see my other one.

01:08:58.447 --> 01:09:00.407
He's done something
the police never have.

01:09:00.573 --> 01:09:02.868
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

01:09:03.035 --> 01:09:05.620
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

01:09:05.787 --> 01:09:08.122
Bruce, help me out here.

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:12.627
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:15.921
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

01:09:16.089 --> 01:09:18.466
And now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

01:09:18.633 --> 01:09:19.843
They're jealous.

01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:22.636
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

01:09:22.804 --> 01:09:26.183
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

01:09:27.975 --> 01:09:29.978
Well, they're European.

01:09:31.813 --> 01:09:34.191
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

01:09:35.108 --> 01:09:38.569
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

01:09:39.154 --> 01:09:40.947
...I'm buying this hotel...

01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:47.162
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:50.707
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

01:09:50.874 --> 01:09:53.001
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

01:09:59.508 --> 01:10:01.093
Thank you.

01:10:02.844 --> 01:10:04.179
Bruce?

01:10:07.766 --> 01:10:09.559
Rachel?

01:10:09.726 --> 01:10:11.144
I'd heard you were back.

01:10:13.188 --> 01:10:14.690
What are you doing?

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.861
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

01:10:20.028 --> 01:10:21.571
You were gone a long time.

01:10:22.155 --> 01:10:25.075
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

01:10:26.994 --> 01:10:28.662
Job's getting worse.

01:10:28.829 --> 01:10:31.540
Can't change the world on your own.

01:10:31.707 --> 01:10:33.792
What choice do I have...

01:10:34.459 --> 01:10:36.211
...when you're too busy swimming?

01:10:37.546 --> 01:10:39.589
Rachel, all of...

01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:41.550
All this...

01:10:42.968 --> 01:10:47.014
It's... It's not me. It's...

01:10:47.431 --> 01:10:50.058
Inside, I am...

01:10:51.268 --> 01:10:53.228
I am more.

01:10:53.895 --> 01:10:55.439
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

01:10:55.605 --> 01:10:59.401
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

01:11:00.444 --> 01:11:01.903
Bruce...

01:11:03.071 --> 01:11:06.575
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

01:11:08.994 --> 01:11:11.580
But it's not who you are underneath...

01:11:12.039 --> 01:11:13.790
...it's what you do that defines you.

01:11:26.345 --> 01:11:27.929
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

01:11:28.096 --> 01:11:30.974
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

01:11:31.141 --> 01:11:34.811
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

01:11:34.978 --> 01:11:37.939
Of course, better safe than sorry.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.946
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

01:11:45.113 --> 01:11:47.574
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

01:11:48.116 --> 01:11:50.619
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.288
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

01:11:53.455 --> 01:11:55.957
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

01:11:56.124 --> 01:11:58.293
About what?
You don't know anything.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:02.631
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

01:12:02.798 --> 01:12:06.968
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

01:12:07.135 --> 01:12:10.806
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:14.309
And those goons you used.

01:12:14.476 --> 01:12:16.311
I own the muscle in this town.

01:12:16.478 --> 01:12:19.856
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

01:12:20.399 --> 01:12:24.611
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

01:12:25.904 --> 01:12:29.032
Well, I already know what he'll say.

01:12:29.449 --> 01:12:30.826
That we should kill you.

01:12:32.703 --> 01:12:35.998
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

01:12:41.962 --> 01:12:43.505
Would you like to see my mask?

01:12:45.048 --> 01:12:46.508
I use it in my experiments.

01:12:49.011 --> 01:12:53.473
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

01:12:53.849 --> 01:12:56.685
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

01:12:57.602 --> 01:12:59.563
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

01:13:00.522 --> 01:13:03.191
They scream and they cry...

01:13:04.192 --> 01:13:05.819
...much as you're doing now.

01:13:08.155 --> 01:13:11.366
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

01:13:11.533 --> 01:13:14.077
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

01:13:14.244 --> 01:13:17.664
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

01:13:39.686 --> 01:13:41.188
Storm's coming.

01:13:45.776 --> 01:13:48.779
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

01:13:48.945 --> 01:13:52.491
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

01:13:52.658 --> 01:13:55.369
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

01:13:55.744 --> 01:13:59.539
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

01:13:59.706 --> 01:14:01.625
Why? What about the other half?

01:14:02.084 --> 01:14:04.503
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

01:14:05.128 --> 01:14:06.713
He'll talk to me.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.925
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

01:14:10.384 --> 01:14:12.928
- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.099
I think you're trying to help.

01:14:22.104 --> 01:14:24.439
But I've been wrong before.

01:14:30.237 --> 01:14:31.947
Come on, I ain't got all night.

01:14:35.283 --> 01:14:37.119
Flass, I have kids to feed.

01:14:37.577 --> 01:14:39.746
What, they don't like falafel?

01:14:55.137 --> 01:14:56.847
Where were the other drugs going?

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:00.309
I never knew. I don't know.

01:15:00.475 --> 01:15:02.686
- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

01:15:08.317 --> 01:15:11.320
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

01:15:11.611 --> 01:15:15.073
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.533
Why?

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.787
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

01:15:20.954 --> 01:15:22.539
...something hidden.
- What?

01:15:22.706 --> 01:15:26.043
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:29.504
- Cops only go there in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

01:15:29.671 --> 01:15:31.465
No...

01:15:45.062 --> 01:15:47.105
This is the one I'm talking about.

01:15:47.397 --> 01:15:49.691
- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

01:15:49.858 --> 01:15:53.695
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

01:15:53.862 --> 01:15:56.239
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

01:15:56.406 --> 01:15:59.826
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

01:15:59.993 --> 01:16:03.330
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

01:16:12.923 --> 01:16:14.174
What the hell is this?

01:16:56.758 --> 01:16:59.928
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

01:17:00.512 --> 01:17:02.264
Get in here!

01:17:02.889 --> 01:17:05.017
The other kids won't believe me.

01:17:28.123 --> 01:17:30.250
Get rid of all traces.

01:17:30.542 --> 01:17:33.462
- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

01:18:09.498 --> 01:18:11.291
Having trouble?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.336
Take a seat. Have a drink.

01:18:15.045 --> 01:18:18.298
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:25.013
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

01:19:16.982 --> 01:19:20.694
Alfred, help me.

01:19:30.579 --> 01:19:33.957
Blood. Take. Take poison.
Blood poison.

01:19:34.124 --> 01:19:37.127
Poisonous. Poisonous.

01:19:41.423 --> 01:19:43.133
Bruce...

01:19:44.426 --> 01:19:45.594
...why do we fall?

01:19:57.689 --> 01:20:01.026
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

01:20:01.401 --> 01:20:03.236
It's your birthday.

01:20:04.571 --> 01:20:05.822
Many happy returns.

01:20:11.036 --> 01:20:14.831
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.586
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

01:20:19.795 --> 01:20:22.714
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

01:20:22.923 --> 01:20:26.009
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

01:20:26.176 --> 01:20:27.552
I analyzed your blood...

01:20:27.719 --> 01:20:31.181
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:33.183
Am I meant to understand any of that?

01:20:33.558 --> 01:20:36.687
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

01:20:37.312 --> 01:20:40.983
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:43.735
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

01:20:43.944 --> 01:20:47.114
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

01:20:47.322 --> 01:20:50.075
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

01:20:50.242 --> 01:20:53.662
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:56.206
Alfred, always a pleasure.

01:20:56.415 --> 01:20:58.041
Lucius.

01:21:02.587 --> 01:21:05.257
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

01:21:05.424 --> 01:21:07.134
- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.677
Rachel?

01:21:10.053 --> 01:21:13.223
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

01:21:13.432 --> 01:21:16.101
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:19.938
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

01:21:20.147 --> 01:21:23.567
- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for days...

01:21:23.775 --> 01:21:27.446
...which means I should probably start
by looking at the bottom of the river.

01:21:27.654 --> 01:21:29.114
- Rachel.
- Excuse me.

01:21:32.034 --> 01:21:33.243
Rachel Dawes.

01:21:33.869 --> 01:21:37.456
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

01:21:37.664 --> 01:21:41.501
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.754
- What's wrong?
- It's Falcone.

01:21:43.962 --> 01:21:46.423
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

01:21:46.631 --> 01:21:49.634
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

01:21:50.886 --> 01:21:52.679
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

01:21:52.888 --> 01:21:55.641
- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

01:21:57.392 --> 01:21:58.935
Happy birthday.

01:22:18.372 --> 01:22:20.457
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

01:22:20.666 --> 01:22:22.292
Keep them happy until I arrive.

01:22:22.459 --> 01:22:24.628
Tell them that joke you know.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.210
Having fun?

01:23:07.337 --> 01:23:10.882
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

01:23:11.091 --> 01:23:12.342
I need some information.

01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:17.306
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.100
1 -ME.

01:23:20.309 --> 01:23:24.021
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:28.442
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

01:23:28.608 --> 01:23:30.527
...but isn't that illegal?

01:23:32.279 --> 01:23:36.491
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:40.662
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

01:23:41.079 --> 01:23:42.706
Did you lose one?

01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:47.377
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

01:23:48.628 --> 01:23:49.880
And I am firing you.

01:23:52.049 --> 01:23:54.009
Didn't you get the memo?

01:24:01.266 --> 01:24:02.893
Scarecrow.

01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:08.065
Scarecrow.

01:24:11.443 --> 01:24:12.736
Scarecrow.

01:24:15.781 --> 01:24:17.949
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

01:24:18.158 --> 01:24:21.078
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

01:24:21.244 --> 01:24:23.455
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

01:24:23.664 --> 01:24:27.959
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

01:24:28.126 --> 01:24:31.713
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

01:24:31.922 --> 01:24:36.134
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

01:24:40.806 --> 01:24:42.182
- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

01:24:42.683 --> 01:24:46.269
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

01:24:46.478 --> 01:24:48.563
...on an external tormentor...

01:24:48.772 --> 01:24:51.942
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

01:24:52.192 --> 01:24:54.569
In this case, a scarecrow.

01:24:56.071 --> 01:25:00.200
- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

01:25:00.367 --> 01:25:01.743
I'm a strong advocate.

01:25:02.661 --> 01:25:04.830
Outside, he was a giant.

01:25:05.038 --> 01:25:07.457
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:09.376
You enjoy the reversal.

01:25:09.584 --> 01:25:12.587
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

01:25:12.754 --> 01:25:14.297
It's why I do what I do.

01:25:14.464 --> 01:25:19.344
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

01:25:19.553 --> 01:25:22.806
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

01:25:23.015 --> 01:25:26.351
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

01:25:26.518 --> 01:25:28.979
- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

01:25:29.187 --> 01:25:32.607
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

01:25:34.026 --> 01:25:35.819
As you wish.

01:25:41.366 --> 01:25:43.327
This way, please.

01:25:43.493 --> 01:25:46.079
There's something
I think you should see.

01:25:57.007 --> 01:25:59.593
This is where we make the medicine.

01:26:06.433 --> 01:26:10.312
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

01:26:35.587 --> 01:26:37.214
Who knows you're here?

01:26:38.256 --> 01:26:39.883
Who knows?

01:26:47.099 --> 01:26:48.308
He's here.

01:26:48.517 --> 01:26:49.726
Who?

01:26:49.935 --> 01:26:51.895
The Batman.

01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:55.565
- What do we do?
- What anyone does...

01:26:55.774 --> 01:26:58.527
...when a prowler comes around.

01:26:59.486 --> 01:27:02.030
- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

01:27:02.614 --> 01:27:05.367
At this point, they can't stop us.

01:27:05.575 --> 01:27:09.079
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

01:27:09.287 --> 01:27:12.457
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

01:27:12.666 --> 01:27:14.751
- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.920
I gave her a concentrated dose.

01:27:17.087 --> 01:27:19.631
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

01:27:22.175 --> 01:27:24.428
The things they say about him.

01:27:24.636 --> 01:27:26.179
Can he really fly?

01:27:26.346 --> 01:27:28.390
I heard he can disappear.

01:27:28.598 --> 01:27:31.601
Well, we'll find out.

01:27:31.893 --> 01:27:33.520
Won't we?

01:28:20.859 --> 01:28:22.986
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:31.495
What have you been doing here?

01:28:34.623 --> 01:28:37.000
Who are you working for?

01:28:41.463 --> 01:28:43.799
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

01:28:44.007 --> 01:28:48.845
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

01:28:49.054 --> 01:28:50.055
Crane.

01:28:52.557 --> 01:28:55.477
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

01:28:56.061 --> 01:28:57.938
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

01:29:10.993 --> 01:29:13.912
Batman, put down your weapons
and surrender.

01:29:14.621 --> 01:29:15.998
You're surrounded.

01:29:21.586 --> 01:29:24.339
- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:27.467
- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

01:29:27.676 --> 01:29:29.803
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

01:29:30.012 --> 01:29:31.555
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

01:29:33.056 --> 01:29:34.599
SWAT's on the way.

01:29:35.684 --> 01:29:36.935
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:30:19.478 --> 01:30:21.188
What's happened to her?

01:30:23.857 --> 01:30:27.611
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

01:30:29.655 --> 01:30:33.367
- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

01:30:37.329 --> 01:30:39.456
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

01:30:47.464 --> 01:30:50.300
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

01:30:50.509 --> 01:30:52.636
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

01:30:53.178 --> 01:30:54.805
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

01:30:55.055 --> 01:30:56.348
Was he working for Falcone?

01:30:56.848 --> 01:30:59.351
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

01:30:59.559 --> 01:31:02.104
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

01:31:02.312 --> 01:31:04.481
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

01:31:08.402 --> 01:31:10.195
What is that?

01:31:11.571 --> 01:31:13.824
- Backup.
- What the...?

01:32:31.793 --> 01:32:33.336
Excuse me.

01:32:38.091 --> 01:32:41.302
- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

01:32:43.179 --> 01:32:44.639
I'll get my car.

01:32:44.806 --> 01:32:46.599
I brought mine.

01:32:47.016 --> 01:32:48.643
Yours?

01:32:57.985 --> 01:32:59.779
I've gotta get me one of those.

01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:03.157
- He is in a vehicle.
- Make and color?

01:33:03.366 --> 01:33:05.702
It's a black...

01:33:07.036 --> 01:33:08.329
...tank.

01:33:10.998 --> 01:33:12.375
Stay calm.

01:33:13.042 --> 01:33:14.836
You've been poisoned.

01:33:17.547 --> 01:33:18.840
I'm on him.

01:33:27.265 --> 01:33:28.307
Breathe slowly.

01:33:38.443 --> 01:33:39.527
Hold on.

01:33:54.042 --> 01:33:55.418
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

01:34:03.926 --> 01:34:05.720
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

01:34:10.266 --> 01:34:11.893
He's got no way off that roof.

01:34:13.269 --> 01:34:16.355
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

01:34:18.733 --> 01:34:21.486
- Trust me.
- Weapons system activated.

01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:40.671
Who is this guy?

01:34:41.005 --> 01:34:42.715
- Where's he going?
- He's on the roof.

01:34:57.146 --> 01:34:59.315
- What street is he taking?
- He's not on a street.

01:34:59.524 --> 01:35:01.234
He's flying on rooftops.

01:35:40.481 --> 01:35:42.692
At least tell me what it looks like.

01:35:45.737 --> 01:35:47.196
Never mind.

01:35:51.075 --> 01:35:52.452
Got him.

01:36:03.337 --> 01:36:04.881
Coming right up on his butt.

01:36:29.614 --> 01:36:32.033
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heading west on l- 17.

01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:39.040
- Air One to ground.
- I lost him.

01:36:39.207 --> 01:36:41.042
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

01:36:41.250 --> 01:36:43.211
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

01:36:43.419 --> 01:36:45.505
Stealth mode activated.

01:36:46.172 --> 01:36:47.382
Stay with me.

01:36:53.596 --> 01:36:55.056
What...? There he is.

01:37:14.784 --> 01:37:16.244
Just hold on.

01:37:20.206 --> 01:37:21.374
Rachel!

01:37:54.157 --> 01:37:56.492
- They get any of this into the mains?
- Yeah.

01:37:56.701 --> 01:37:59.537
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

01:37:59.746 --> 01:38:02.582
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:06.335
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

01:38:06.544 --> 01:38:08.796
Must be a compound that has
to be absorbed through the lungs.

01:38:19.057 --> 01:38:20.767
How do you feel?

01:38:23.519 --> 01:38:24.979
Where are we?

01:38:25.521 --> 01:38:29.275
- Why did you bring me here?
- lf I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

01:38:29.484 --> 01:38:31.486
- You were poisoned.
- It was...

01:38:31.694 --> 01:38:35.281
- It was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

01:38:35.490 --> 01:38:37.575
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

01:38:38.451 --> 01:38:40.078
I don't have the luxury of friends.

01:38:40.995 --> 01:38:44.332
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

01:38:44.499 --> 01:38:48.419
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

01:38:48.628 --> 01:38:50.338
- What are they?
- The antidote.

01:38:50.546 --> 01:38:53.841
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

01:38:54.258 --> 01:38:55.510
Mass production?

01:38:55.718 --> 01:38:58.846
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

01:39:24.831 --> 01:39:28.209
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

01:39:28.418 --> 01:39:31.337
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

01:39:31.504 --> 01:39:33.965
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

01:39:34.173 --> 01:39:37.176
- It's not.
- What would you call that?

01:39:39.053 --> 01:39:41.723
- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

01:39:41.931 --> 01:39:45.560
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

01:39:45.768 --> 01:39:48.855
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

01:39:49.063 --> 01:39:53.443
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

01:39:53.651 --> 01:39:55.194
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

01:39:55.403 --> 01:39:58.322
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

01:39:58.781 --> 01:40:02.118
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

01:40:02.577 --> 01:40:05.163
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

01:40:05.496 --> 01:40:09.083
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

01:40:09.417 --> 01:40:12.336
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

01:40:12.503 --> 01:40:14.338
- Is Fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:14.547 --> 01:40:16.174
We need to send these people away.

01:40:16.382 --> 01:40:19.302
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:21.304
I don't care about my name.

01:40:21.512 --> 01:40:24.682
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

01:40:26.434 --> 01:40:28.770
And it's all that's left of him.

01:40:30.730 --> 01:40:32.273
Don't destroy it.

01:40:47.622 --> 01:40:49.749
- Mr. Earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

01:40:49.957 --> 01:40:51.334
Thank you.

01:40:51.667 --> 01:40:53.669
How did the stock offering go?

01:40:53.961 --> 01:40:55.129
Prices soared.

01:40:55.338 --> 01:40:56.547
Who was buying?

01:40:56.756 --> 01:40:58.633
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

01:40:58.841 --> 01:41:00.551
It's a bit technical.

01:41:00.718 --> 01:41:02.428
The key thing is...

01:41:02.595 --> 01:41:04.555
...our company's future is secure.

01:41:06.432 --> 01:41:07.433
Great.

01:41:21.155 --> 01:41:23.449
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

01:41:29.205 --> 01:41:30.998
What was the plan, Crane?

01:41:31.165 --> 01:41:33.376
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

01:41:33.793 --> 01:41:37.046
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

01:41:37.255 --> 01:41:39.048
Who were you working for, Crane?

01:41:41.175 --> 01:41:43.344
Oh, it's too late.

01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:46.055
You can't stop it now.

01:41:51.144 --> 01:41:52.687
Here.

01:41:52.854 --> 01:41:54.814
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

01:41:55.023 --> 01:41:57.942
And thank you for that item.

01:41:59.444 --> 01:42:00.653
You're welcome.

01:42:00.862 --> 01:42:03.614
- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

01:42:03.906 --> 01:42:07.702
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

01:42:08.286 --> 01:42:09.370
Weeks. Why?

01:42:09.579 --> 01:42:12.707
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:16.836
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

01:42:17.754 --> 01:42:19.130
What?

01:42:19.338 --> 01:42:21.841
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

01:42:22.050 --> 01:42:24.886
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

01:42:25.344 --> 01:42:28.598
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

01:42:29.057 --> 01:42:30.224
Misplaced?

01:42:30.433 --> 01:42:33.895
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

01:42:35.938 --> 01:42:39.400
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

01:42:39.609 --> 01:42:42.695
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

01:42:42.904 --> 01:42:44.947
My security clearance
has been revoked.

01:42:45.156 --> 01:42:47.116
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

01:42:47.575 --> 01:42:49.285
I suppose not.

01:42:51.329 --> 01:42:55.958
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

01:42:56.167 --> 01:42:59.003
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

01:42:59.212 --> 01:43:01.631
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

01:43:07.303 --> 01:43:09.097
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.891
I watched him die.

01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:15.103
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

01:43:17.897 --> 01:43:20.316
Are his methods supernatural?

01:43:24.904 --> 01:43:29.283
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.623
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

01:43:35.832 --> 01:43:37.834
...wouldn't begrudge me
dual identities.

01:43:38.710 --> 01:43:40.503
I saved your life.

01:43:40.670 --> 01:43:43.131
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

01:43:46.342 --> 01:43:48.511
Your quarrel is with me.

01:43:49.429 --> 01:43:51.889
You let these people go.

01:43:52.181 --> 01:43:55.435
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

01:43:57.729 --> 01:43:59.355
Everyone.

01:44:00.148 --> 01:44:01.983
Everybody?

01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:06.487
I...

01:44:06.946 --> 01:44:11.159
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

01:44:13.286 --> 01:44:14.996
No, really.

01:44:16.039 --> 01:44:18.791
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

01:44:18.958 --> 01:44:22.503
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

01:44:22.712 --> 01:44:26.340
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

01:44:26.549 --> 01:44:29.135
- That's enough, Bruce.
- I'm not finished.

01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:31.220
To all of you...

01:44:31.387 --> 01:44:35.767
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

01:44:35.933 --> 01:44:40.980
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:44.734
...please, leave me in peace.

01:44:44.942 --> 01:44:47.528
Please go.

01:44:47.904 --> 01:44:51.282
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

01:44:51.491 --> 01:44:53.659
The party's over, get out.

01:44:53.868 --> 01:44:57.121
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

01:45:01.959 --> 01:45:04.212
He's turning into a jerk.

01:45:10.551 --> 01:45:12.261
Amusing.

01:45:12.595 --> 01:45:16.015
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

01:45:16.224 --> 01:45:19.686
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

01:45:19.894 --> 01:45:22.021
So Crane was working for you.

01:45:22.230 --> 01:45:26.025
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

01:45:26.401 --> 01:45:28.403
He was able to weaponize it.

01:45:28.611 --> 01:45:30.571
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:35.326
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

01:45:36.035 --> 01:45:40.581
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

01:45:40.748 --> 01:45:44.794
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:59.517
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

01:45:59.767 --> 01:46:03.104
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

01:46:03.271 --> 01:46:05.064
Crime. Despair.

01:46:05.273 --> 01:46:07.316
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

01:46:07.984 --> 01:46:11.112
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.780
...for thousands of years.

01:46:12.989 --> 01:46:16.534
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

01:46:16.743 --> 01:46:18.119
Burned London to the ground.

01:46:18.327 --> 01:46:21.164
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

01:46:21.330 --> 01:46:23.291
...we return to restore the balance.

01:46:23.458 --> 01:46:25.001
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

01:46:26.335 --> 01:46:29.005
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

01:46:29.213 --> 01:46:31.007
You're defending a city so corrupt...

01:46:31.215 --> 01:46:34.385
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:46.856
Time to play.

01:46:51.027 --> 01:46:53.696
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

01:46:53.863 --> 01:46:55.948
But I believed in you.

01:46:56.157 --> 01:46:59.869
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

01:47:00.161 --> 01:47:02.372
You were my greatest student.

01:47:02.705 --> 01:47:05.833
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

01:47:06.667 --> 01:47:09.253
I'll be standing where I belong.

01:47:09.921 --> 01:47:13.007
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

01:47:14.717 --> 01:47:17.303
No one can save Gotham.

01:47:20.681 --> 01:47:25.311
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

01:47:26.562 --> 01:47:31.192
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

01:47:31.776 --> 01:47:35.029
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

01:47:35.321 --> 01:47:37.490
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:40.410
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

01:47:40.576 --> 01:47:43.413
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

01:47:43.871 --> 01:47:48.543
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

01:47:49.001 --> 01:47:51.170
...such as your parents.

01:47:55.258 --> 01:47:58.720
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

01:47:59.011 --> 01:48:01.764
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

01:48:01.973 --> 01:48:04.392
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.270
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

01:48:07.478 --> 01:48:09.272
We are back to finish the job.

01:48:09.981 --> 01:48:13.234
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

01:48:13.401 --> 01:48:16.946
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:20.116
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

01:48:20.324 --> 01:48:24.370
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

01:48:29.417 --> 01:48:31.544
- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

01:48:31.753 --> 01:48:33.755
...to mind your surroundings.

01:48:35.965 --> 01:48:37.925
Justice is balance.

01:48:38.134 --> 01:48:40.261
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

01:48:42.972 --> 01:48:45.099
Consider us even.

01:49:01.532 --> 01:49:03.242
No one comes out. Make sure.

01:49:13.169 --> 01:49:14.629
They're all gone?

01:49:14.796 --> 01:49:17.548
- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

01:49:17.715 --> 01:49:19.509
Serial killers, rapists.

01:49:19.717 --> 01:49:22.553
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:24.180
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

01:49:24.347 --> 01:49:28.559
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

01:49:28.768 --> 01:49:31.604
...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

01:49:54.836 --> 01:49:57.588
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

01:50:03.594 --> 01:50:05.680
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

01:50:10.226 --> 01:50:14.605
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

01:50:53.061 --> 01:50:55.104
What have I done, Alfred?

01:50:56.147 --> 01:50:58.066
Everything my family...

01:50:58.274 --> 01:51:00.151
...my father, built...

01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:06.449
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

01:51:06.657 --> 01:51:08.868
I wanted to save Gotham.

01:51:09.744 --> 01:51:11.579
I failed.

01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:14.082
Why do we fall, sir?

01:51:17.293 --> 01:51:20.755
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

01:51:23.257 --> 01:51:25.385
You still haven't given up on me?

01:51:27.303 --> 01:51:28.763
Never.

01:51:29.847 --> 01:51:31.140
Down!

01:51:31.349 --> 01:51:34.268
Harassment! I see harassment!

01:51:34.435 --> 01:51:36.479
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

01:51:36.688 --> 01:51:38.564
Madman with a gun.

01:51:39.774 --> 01:51:43.111
With residents furious at the
unprecedented show of police strength...

01:51:43.277 --> 01:51:46.656
...to round up the inmates...
- We're about to raise these bridges.

01:51:46.864 --> 01:51:50.451
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

01:51:57.875 --> 01:52:00.128
- Just shut up!
- Hey, Flass, cool it!

01:52:00.336 --> 01:52:01.587
Hold these people back.

01:52:01.796 --> 01:52:04.799
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

01:52:04.966 --> 01:52:07.343
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend sent me with this.

01:52:07.552 --> 01:52:09.011
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

01:52:09.178 --> 01:52:10.638
Hopefully you won't need it.

01:52:10.847 --> 01:52:13.975
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

01:52:15.143 --> 01:52:17.562
All right, last one across.

01:52:18.271 --> 01:52:22.150
People, they want this bridge up
in no more than three minutes!

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:25.737
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

01:52:26.404 --> 01:52:27.405
Go!

01:52:54.223 --> 01:52:56.017
I can't find my mom.

01:52:56.392 --> 01:52:57.852
Hey!

01:53:06.277 --> 01:53:07.987
What the hell are you doing?

01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:11.074
Gentlemen...

01:53:11.532 --> 01:53:14.035
...time to spread the word.

01:53:15.787 --> 01:53:17.163
And the word is...

01:53:18.456 --> 01:53:20.166
...panic.

01:53:44.273 --> 01:53:45.900
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

01:53:46.901 --> 01:53:48.194
Right there.

01:53:48.528 --> 01:53:50.738
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

01:54:07.714 --> 01:54:09.257
It's okay.

01:54:42.123 --> 01:54:43.666
This is Commissioner Loeb.

01:54:43.833 --> 01:54:45.543
Come on, somebody talk to me.

01:54:45.710 --> 01:54:47.170
Come on!

01:55:06.856 --> 01:55:08.858
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

01:55:09.192 --> 01:55:10.485
What the hell is going on?

01:55:10.693 --> 01:55:14.113
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

01:55:14.322 --> 01:55:18.534
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

01:55:18.701 --> 01:55:20.703
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

01:55:21.037 --> 01:55:24.999
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

01:55:25.875 --> 01:55:27.502
Of course they are!

01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:30.713
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

01:55:32.465 --> 01:55:33.841
Gordon...

01:55:34.050 --> 01:55:36.260
...there's nobody left to send in.

01:55:37.845 --> 01:55:39.555
So I'm on my own?

01:55:43.643 --> 01:55:45.269
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

01:55:45.478 --> 01:55:48.022
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

01:55:48.231 --> 01:55:50.983
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

01:55:51.150 --> 01:55:53.027
- How are they gonna do that?
- The train.

01:55:53.236 --> 01:55:57.031
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:58.950
If the machine gets to the station...

01:55:59.117 --> 01:56:02.578
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

01:56:02.787 --> 01:56:04.330
Covering Gotham in this poison.

01:56:04.539 --> 01:56:07.709
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

01:56:07.917 --> 01:56:09.711
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

01:56:15.967 --> 01:56:17.593
There you are!

01:56:17.802 --> 01:56:19.762
There is nothing to fear...

01:56:19.971 --> 01:56:21.681
...but fear itself!

01:56:22.765 --> 01:56:25.059
I am here to help!

01:56:56.299 --> 01:56:58.426
Batman will save us. He'll come.

01:57:03.681 --> 01:57:05.558
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

01:57:14.233 --> 01:57:17.570
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

01:57:23.493 --> 01:57:25.578
I told you he'd come.

01:57:30.625 --> 01:57:32.251
Wait.

01:57:33.211 --> 01:57:34.837
You could die.

01:57:35.004 --> 01:57:36.255
At least tell me your name.

01:57:41.677 --> 01:57:43.846
It's not who I am underneath...

01:57:44.847 --> 01:57:49.143
...but what I do that defines me.

01:57:49.519 --> 01:57:50.812
Bruce?

01:58:24.554 --> 01:58:27.849
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

01:58:28.057 --> 01:58:30.518
- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

01:58:30.727 --> 01:58:33.021
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:36.524
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

01:58:36.733 --> 01:58:40.403
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

01:58:53.249 --> 01:58:55.543
GPS online.

01:59:02.425 --> 01:59:04.594
In 100 yards.

01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:36.751
Gentlemen.

02:00:04.195 --> 02:00:06.406
Who the hell authorized this?

02:00:16.999 --> 02:00:19.043
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

02:00:26.342 --> 02:00:28.928
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

02:00:29.137 --> 02:00:30.513
If that pressure reaches us...

02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:33.683
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

02:00:44.152 --> 02:00:46.988
At the next intersection, turn right.

02:01:11.721 --> 02:01:13.181
You will never learn.

02:01:20.730 --> 02:01:21.731
Sorry.

02:01:25.735 --> 02:01:28.738
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

02:01:45.505 --> 02:01:47.757
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

02:02:01.104 --> 02:02:02.313
Evacuate the building.

02:02:02.563 --> 02:02:05.024
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:16.119
Weapons system activated.

02:02:20.248 --> 02:02:21.249
Nice ride.

02:02:36.514 --> 02:02:37.515
Armed.

02:02:49.485 --> 02:02:50.945
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:55.116
Come on. Come on.

02:02:59.871 --> 02:03:01.914
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

02:03:02.123 --> 02:03:05.960
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

02:03:06.169 --> 02:03:08.713
Who said anything about stopping it?

02:03:14.552 --> 02:03:16.095
Yes!

02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:27.648
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

02:03:35.531 --> 02:03:37.992
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

02:03:38.326 --> 02:03:40.578
I won't kill you...

02:03:45.041 --> 02:03:47.168
...but I don't have to save you.

02:05:02.368 --> 02:05:05.455
- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:12.628
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

02:05:13.129 --> 02:05:14.672
You did.

02:05:14.881 --> 02:05:16.924
I got another job.

02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:19.260
Yours.

02:05:19.719 --> 02:05:21.429
On whose authority?

02:05:22.055 --> 02:05:23.931
Batman may have made
the front page...

02:05:24.182 --> 02:05:27.101
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:34.901
Bruce Wayne.

02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:38.863
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

02:05:39.072 --> 02:05:41.824
- The fact that I'm the owner.
- What are you talking about?

02:05:42.075 --> 02:05:43.951
The company went public a week ago.

02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:45.620
And I bought most of the shares.

02:05:45.995 --> 02:05:49.415
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

02:05:49.624 --> 02:05:52.794
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

02:05:53.044 --> 02:05:56.297
...is that my company's future
is secure.

02:05:56.714 --> 02:05:58.091
Right, Mr. Fox?

02:05:58.299 --> 02:06:00.093
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

02:06:02.345 --> 02:06:03.888
Didn't you get the memo?

02:06:22.865 --> 02:06:26.035
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

02:06:26.244 --> 02:06:27.620
...I'm sorry.

02:06:28.496 --> 02:06:31.165
The day that Chill died, I...

02:06:33.042 --> 02:06:34.669
I said terrible things.

02:06:35.169 --> 02:06:36.879
But true things.

02:06:37.547 --> 02:06:39.340
I was a coward with a gun...

02:06:39.549 --> 02:06:43.302
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

02:06:44.387 --> 02:06:47.056
I never stopped thinking about you.

02:06:48.558 --> 02:06:50.184
About us.

02:06:50.810 --> 02:06:52.770
And when I heard you were back, I...

02:06:53.604 --> 02:06:55.773
I started to hope.

02:07:19.881 --> 02:07:22.550
But then I found out about your mask.

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:26.596
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

02:07:27.221 --> 02:07:28.848
No. This...

02:07:30.058 --> 02:07:31.768
...is your mask.

02:07:33.728 --> 02:07:37.231
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

02:07:38.107 --> 02:07:40.068
The man I loved...

02:07:40.818 --> 02:07:42.278
...the man who vanished...

02:07:43.488 --> 02:07:45.615
...he never came back at all.

02:07:50.119 --> 02:07:52.789
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

02:07:54.957 --> 02:07:58.628
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

02:07:59.712 --> 02:08:01.672
...I'll see him again.

02:08:12.725 --> 02:08:15.645
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

02:08:18.481 --> 02:08:20.900
Your father would be
very proud of you.

02:08:21.150 --> 02:08:22.777
Just like me.

02:08:49.762 --> 02:08:51.639
What will you do?

02:08:53.016 --> 02:08:54.559
Rebuild it.

02:08:55.476 --> 02:08:57.812
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

02:09:04.694 --> 02:09:05.903
Just the way it was, sir?

02:09:08.031 --> 02:09:09.240
Yeah, why?

02:09:09.449 --> 02:09:12.285
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

02:09:12.452 --> 02:09:14.871
...improving the foundations.

02:09:15.079 --> 02:09:17.999
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

02:09:33.723 --> 02:09:36.559
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:40.229
- Well, sergeant?
- It's "lieutenant" now.

02:09:40.605 --> 02:09:42.065
You really started something.

02:09:42.273 --> 02:09:44.233
Bent cops running scared.

02:09:44.442 --> 02:09:45.818
Hope on the streets.

02:09:46.110 --> 02:09:49.697
- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

02:09:50.239 --> 02:09:54.077
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

02:09:54.786 --> 02:09:56.412
We will.

02:09:56.621 --> 02:09:58.247
We can bring Gotham back.

02:09:58.456 --> 02:10:00.917
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

02:10:01.125 --> 02:10:05.421
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

02:10:05.630 --> 02:10:09.926
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

02:10:10.134 --> 02:10:13.388
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

02:10:13.846 --> 02:10:15.723
...and jumping off rooftops.

02:10:17.141 --> 02:10:19.143
Now, take this guy.

02:10:19.435 --> 02:10:21.437
Armed robbery, double homicide.

02:10:21.646 --> 02:10:24.899
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

02:10:25.149 --> 02:10:27.068
Leaves a calling card.

02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:34.784
I'll look into it.

02:10:38.287 --> 02:10:39.747
I never said thank you.

02:10:44.836 --> 02:10:46.879
And you'll never have to.
