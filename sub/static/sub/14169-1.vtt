Stephan Gold,

01:36.200 --> 01:38.851
was the youngest

David Perez had his 29th

through the checkpoint,

01:50.200 --> 01:52.521

sadistic experiments

defiles the annals of medicine,

02:16.280 --> 02:18.362

been to capture him

02:24.840 --> 02:27.889
and return him
to Israel to stand trial.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.446
Instead, it ended on the

Israel's greatest nightmare,

02:42.560 --> 02:44.085

And in the simple act

away his life in some jungle,

apartment searched,

we find that
on his computer.

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.605
Did he say anything
to you about it last night?

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.925
Rachel,
did he say anything?

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.329
Why? Why did
he kill himself?

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.845
Because
he couldn't handle it.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.724
I told him
we had to deal with it,

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.211
and he couldn't handle it.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.681
He thought the whole story would
come out and he panicked.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.281
"Deal with it"?

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.126
What does that mean?
"Deal with it."

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.121
I told him to find Vogel.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.802
I told him to finish it.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.648
Did you know
he'd been ill?

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.924
You did, didn't you?
You knew he'd been ill. You knew it!

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.121

wasn't strong enough!

coward's way out.

just left it alone!

in a hospital.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.242

Nobody would be listening.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.449

from a newspaper in Kiev.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.165

He heard about the story and
he wants to interview Vogel.

Then it all falls apart.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.523

in, but the journalist does.

out where he is.

to find out.

I'll tell you something,

at that moment
when I was on the floor,

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.047
I didn't think
about myself at all.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.246
I was thinking about my mother and
what she had suffered in Europe.

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.722

me the strength to get up again.

supposed to interview him?

from him again.

if you had have found him?

I would have
told the truth.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.441
I would have gone to
a newspaper and said,

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.330
"This is the
Surgeon of Birkenau. "

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:52.484

have seen him face trial.

that what you would have done?

just us, there's Sarah.

She hasn't done
anything wrong.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.048
She wrote a book.
Did you know that?

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.281
Yes.

If the truth were to come out
now, it would destroy her.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.801
So no. I would not
have told the truth.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.565

He didn't kill himself because he was
afraid the story might come out.

he was asking for something.
