WEBVTT

00:02.179 --> 00:04.014
"The Front Door"

00:04.245 --> 00:06.169
FRANKIE: (screaming)
Axl!

00:06.451 --> 00:08.196
Axl, get out
of bed now!

00:08.231 --> 00:10.784
- Now! I said, now!
- (grunts)

00:11.320 --> 00:13.425
FRANKIE: <i>Okay,</i>
<i>I know this doesn't look good.</i>

00:13.460 --> 00:16.329
<i>But in fairness to me, this</i>
<i>wasn't how the morning started.</i>

00:16.364 --> 00:17.200
(knock on door)

00:18.700 --> 00:20.436
Axl, honey,

00:20.471 --> 00:21.563
time to get up.

00:24.467 --> 00:26.071
Come on, sleepyhead.

00:26.285 --> 00:27.363
(groans)

00:27.591 --> 00:28.782
Rise and shine.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.896
Axl, the bus comes
in 15 minutes.

00:32.931 --> 00:33.936
Let's go!

00:37.621 --> 00:38.597
(Axl grunts)

00:38.706 --> 00:39.768
<i>You get the picture.</i>

00:39.991 --> 00:41.893
God. Overreact much?

00:41.894 --> 00:44.798
You missed the bus, and now
I have to drive you to school!

00:44.833 --> 00:45.883
Get dressed!

00:46.133 --> 00:47.608
(sighs)

00:50.310 --> 00:52.785
And take your plate
to the kitchen!

00:52.842 --> 00:54.440
In case you hadn't heard,
we had to let

00:54.490 --> 00:57.160
the room service waiters go,
due to the economy!

00:57.948 --> 00:59.153
<i>Being a parent
is a lot like</i>

00:59.203 --> 01:01.113
<i>being a cop</i>
<i>in a bad part of town.</i>

01:01.114 --> 01:04.174
<i>When you're up against a felon,</i>
<i>or, in our case, teenager,</i>

01:04.430 --> 01:06.028
<i>it's good to know</i>
<i>you've got backup.</i>

01:06.063 --> 01:06.582
Mike?

01:07.195 --> 01:09.962
I have <i>had</i> it with him.
He won't get out of bed,

01:09.963 --> 01:11.669
he leaves
his dirty dishes in the hall,

01:11.704 --> 01:13.771
I ask him to do <i>anything,</i>
I get...

01:13.772 --> 01:14.483
(imitates Axl's sigh)

01:14.860 --> 01:15.892
Well, he had
a game last night.

01:15.927 --> 01:18.395
- He's probably tired.
- Don't make excuses for him!

01:18.445 --> 01:20.510
I need you
to back me up here, Mike.

01:20.545 --> 01:21.645
Okay, yes,
I will do that.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.728
I will back you up.
Just say the word.

01:24.149 --> 01:26.622
Just say, "Mike, I'm weak.
I can't control my child.

01:26.657 --> 01:28.434
I need your supreme
parenting skills."

01:29.197 --> 01:31.048
Will you just
kick his ass, please?

01:31.290 --> 01:32.600
I'm going in.
(knocks on countertop)

01:36.828 --> 01:39.135
Axl, I'm gonna
count to three!

01:39.521 --> 01:40.524
One...

01:41.104 --> 01:41.937
two...

01:42.636 --> 01:44.693
Hey, buddy.
Heck of a game last night.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.379
Anyway, I think you'd better
get up, get ready for school.

01:48.407 --> 01:50.435
And try not to set off
your mom like that, okay?

01:50.443 --> 01:51.308
Don't poke the bear.

01:51.348 --> 01:52.862
The bear's stressed out
and tired.

01:53.412 --> 01:55.404
And, uh, take this plate to
the kitchen for me, will you?

01:56.200 --> 01:56.787
Thanks, pal.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.323
And I <i>mean</i> it!

02:02.620 --> 02:04.580
<i>So after</i>
<i>a stressful morning with Axl,</i>

02:04.615 --> 02:06.206
<i>work was almost</i>
<i>like a break.</i>

02:06.241 --> 02:06.967
You people

02:07.018 --> 02:09.883
are the sorriest bunch of losers
I've ever laid eyes on.

02:09.894 --> 02:11.159
<i>I said, "Almost."</i>

02:11.270 --> 02:12.880
And to reward you
for that achievement,

02:12.930 --> 02:15.034
anyone who can't sell a car
by this time next week

02:15.069 --> 02:17.255
is gonna find themselves
out on the street.

02:17.290 --> 02:18.504
You're gonna fire us?

02:18.622 --> 02:19.444
Forget that.

02:19.735 --> 02:21.039
I'm gonna put you
out on the street

02:21.090 --> 02:22.726
in that dog suit.
(chuckles)

02:24.352 --> 02:25.149
MAN: Loser!

02:28.972 --> 02:30.243
Which one of you
is gonna be the head,

02:30.278 --> 02:31.850
and which one
is gonna be the tail?

02:33.287 --> 02:36.157
I have asthma, so I have
to be up near the mouth.

02:36.949 --> 02:38.761
EHLERT: Now I want to hear
this sales bell ringing

02:38.796 --> 02:40.548
like a trolley car
in Nancy town.

02:40.627 --> 02:41.467
(rings bell)

02:42.651 --> 02:45.040
Got no room for
deadweight around here.

02:45.712 --> 02:47.451
Speaking of which,
Frances...

02:47.932 --> 02:49.159
My office.

02:50.870 --> 02:54.817
So, Frances, how would you
describe your sales technique?

02:54.844 --> 02:58.149
Well, I try to connect
personally with the customer,

02:58.150 --> 03:00.428
um, give them
honest information

03:00.463 --> 03:01.945
about the car they're
thinking of buying.

03:01.980 --> 03:04.514
I oughta fire you right now.
I don't get it.

03:04.997 --> 03:07.852
I read that women want
to buy cars from other women.

03:08.201 --> 03:11.265
That's why I went against
all judgment and hired one.

03:11.618 --> 03:12.873
Now you got
a chance here

03:13.045 --> 03:15.340
to carry the torch
for all the lady-kind

03:15.569 --> 03:17.323
or burn
the whole deal down.

03:17.682 --> 03:18.404
It's up to you.

03:18.867 --> 03:19.718
(chuckles)

03:19.991 --> 03:23.462
I'm kind of like the Rosa Parks
of Ehlert Cars, huh?

03:24.126 --> 03:26.799
Rosa Parks? Don't even
get me started on her.

03:28.185 --> 03:28.744
Now look...

03:28.898 --> 03:31.713
You gotta find
your game, and quick!

03:33.271 --> 03:36.072
Sounds wrong
to put a woman in a dog suit,

03:36.107 --> 03:38.710
but... aw, hell.
(laughing)

03:38.889 --> 03:40.111
Doesn't sound wrong
at all.

03:40.112 --> 03:41.308
(chuckles)

03:46.393 --> 03:47.275
What are you doing?

03:47.276 --> 03:49.288
Making a pyramid
out of sugar cubes.

03:49.841 --> 03:51.151
- (whispers) <i>Sugar cubes.</i>
- Oh, no.

03:51.223 --> 03:54.604
No! Don't tell me you have
a class project due tomorrow.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.615
(normal voice) No,
it's not due until next week.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.271
<i>I know it doesn't</i>
<i>seem like much,</i>

03:58.321 --> 04:00.968
<i>but this was a milestone</i>
<i>in Brick's life...</i>

04:01.010 --> 04:03.577
<i>And mine. He was</i>
<i>a full six and a half days</i>

04:03.647 --> 04:05.146
<i>ahead of</i>
<i>his usual schedule.</i>

04:05.950 --> 04:09.441
A papier-mâché Niagara Falls...
by morning?

04:09.654 --> 04:11.016
(mouth full)
Seriously, Brick?

04:11.222 --> 04:14.459
A Choctaw medicine man costume
by lunch?

04:16.697 --> 04:17.724
(exhales deeply)

04:17.829 --> 04:19.579
I'm gonna need
some more sugar cubes.

04:19.632 --> 04:23.070
Sugar cubes?
You got it. No problem.

04:23.105 --> 04:24.996
Six and a half days--
I'll get you a truckload.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.446
Mom? School pictures
came today.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.840
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>
<i>Please, no.</i>

04:31.014 --> 04:33.396
<i>I was just on a sugar cube</i>
<i>high, and now this.</i>

04:33.549 --> 04:35.566
- I haven't looked yet.
- Oh, boy.

04:36.753 --> 04:38.748
Okay,
let's do this together.

04:38.889 --> 04:41.168
<i>Sue has many</i>
<i>wonderful qualities,</i>

04:41.203 --> 04:43.798
<i>but we've never seen</i>
<i>any of them show up on film.</i>

04:46.498 --> 04:47.891
- (sighs)
- (clears throat)

04:49.168 --> 04:51.236
Okay, no biggie.

04:51.504 --> 04:53.933
We just have to go
for a retake, right?

04:54.648 --> 04:56.543
But to get a retake,
I have to give this one back.

04:57.211 --> 04:59.481
What if the retake picture
is worse than this?

04:59.798 --> 05:00.802
I'll be stuck with it!

05:01.082 --> 05:02.501
I think
it's worth the risk.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.448
And maybe next time--

05:04.483 --> 05:06.602
I know, I know.
Just relax and be myself.

05:06.653 --> 05:09.049
No! Remember, we tried that
last year? And...

05:10.059 --> 05:12.880
Maybe if you thought
of something pleasant,

05:12.915 --> 05:15.799
like a rainbow
or Ashton Kutcher.

05:16.553 --> 05:17.436
There you go!

05:17.534 --> 05:19.678
Perfect! Now can you
do that again tomorrow?

05:20.070 --> 05:22.727
No. I'm just gonna hold it
till then. (chuckles)

05:24.328 --> 05:26.231
Hey. How was work?
How's--

05:26.577 --> 05:29.389
Oh, no. Is it school picture
time again? Damn it!

05:29.390 --> 05:31.689
Why the hell do they do this,
year after year?

05:31.724 --> 05:32.552
- This kid--
- I know.

05:32.695 --> 05:33.773
She's having it retaken.

05:35.290 --> 05:35.853
Wait a minute.

05:35.854 --> 05:38.142
Is that Axl's plate from
this morning on the floor?

05:38.157 --> 05:39.656
At least it made it
into the kitchen.

05:40.426 --> 05:41.055
(sighs)

05:41.341 --> 05:42.515
Hang on.
What are you doing?

05:42.662 --> 05:45.357
I can't get into another battle
with him today, Mike.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.690
I am exhausted.

05:46.770 --> 05:48.535
You know,
picture day and everything?

05:48.570 --> 05:51.025
No. You told him
to clean up his mess,

05:51.669 --> 05:53.224
I told him
to clean up his mess...

05:53.852 --> 05:54.970
He's gonna
clean up his mess.

05:56.637 --> 05:58.572
(yawning) Well, call me
if you need backup.

05:59.747 --> 06:01.581
<i>(hip-hop music playing)</i>

06:01.847 --> 06:02.629
(sighs deeply)

06:03.484 --> 06:04.384
Look what I found.

06:04.819 --> 06:07.425
- Oh, hey, thanks, man.
- No, you moron.

06:07.522 --> 06:09.403
It's the sandwich I told you
to throw away this morning.

06:09.464 --> 06:10.314
What were you thinking?

06:10.774 --> 06:12.274
Hey, Axl.
Look at me.

06:12.727 --> 06:14.394
- (mouse clicking)
- <i>(rock music playing)</i>

06:14.395 --> 06:16.223
Look at me
and continue looking at me.

06:16.905 --> 06:19.709
Better. I thought I told you
to throw this sandwich away.

06:20.034 --> 06:21.131
No, you said,
"Take it to the kitchen."

06:21.192 --> 06:21.934
And throw it out.

06:22.202 --> 06:23.816
- You didn't say that.
- Okay. Well,

06:23.866 --> 06:25.977
then let me break it down for you
so you wont get confused.

06:26.206 --> 06:29.163
You're gonna take this plate--
the one with the sandwich on it

06:29.374 --> 06:31.543
and take it to the kitchen--
the room with the sink,

06:31.578 --> 06:33.458
and you're gonna throw
the sandwich in the garbage

06:33.578 --> 06:35.988
and you're gonna put the dirty
dish in the dishwasher.

06:35.989 --> 06:38.162
And you're going to do this
after every meal,

06:38.197 --> 06:40.058
for as long as you live
in this house.

06:40.846 --> 06:41.488
Got it?

06:42.161 --> 06:43.684
Fine, whatever.
Yeah.

06:44.542 --> 06:45.324
<i>Now.</i>

06:45.545 --> 06:47.295
I'll get to it.
Chill.

06:49.995 --> 06:50.883
(power turns off)

06:50.884 --> 06:53.464
Oh, God! (grunts)
You are always on me! Fine!

06:54.591 --> 06:55.805
And while
we're on the subject,

06:55.840 --> 06:58.039
your mom and I are sick of
your attitude. From now on,

06:58.074 --> 07:00.417
when she asks you
to do something, you do it.

07:00.675 --> 07:03.522
<i>You got to admit--</i>
<i>My partner is pretty hot.</i>

07:03.557 --> 07:05.411
Also, you're gonna start
earning your keep around here.

07:05.446 --> 07:07.147
As a matter of fact, your mom
has a whole list of things

07:07.197 --> 07:08.989
she wants you to do.
Go, Frankie.

07:09.716 --> 07:11.538
Oh! Um...
(exhales sharply) Yes.

07:11.573 --> 07:12.777
There's a lot of stuff
for you to do.

07:12.812 --> 07:13.898
Just give me a second.
Um...

07:15.223 --> 07:16.367
(whispers)
Kind of on the spot here.

07:16.981 --> 07:18.547
Okay, well, whatever
she comes up with,

07:18.582 --> 07:19.566
you're gonna do it
with a smile

07:19.601 --> 07:20.474
- on your face--
- Rake the leaves!

07:20.621 --> 07:23.025
Fold the laundry, uh,
clean the light fixtures--

07:23.086 --> 07:25.516
- Ooh, they're coming now. Uh...
- You can't do this!

07:26.036 --> 07:28.230
- You heard your mother.
- God! This is so unfair!

07:30.000 --> 07:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:39.079 --> 07:40.657
And you're gonna
fix that, too.

07:41.317 --> 07:44.048
No way! No.
It was already broken.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.932
Mom has been telling you to fix
that hinge for, like, a month!

07:45.967 --> 07:47.799
- Right, Mom?
- Uh...

07:48.399 --> 07:49.995
I support your father.

07:51.339 --> 07:52.333
Classic!

07:53.015 --> 07:55.129
And this door stays
right where it is

07:55.164 --> 07:57.260
until you march your butt
back here and fix it!

07:59.191 --> 08:02.378
<i>Oh, I forgot to mention--</i>
<i>two days a week,</i>

08:02.413 --> 08:04.460
<i>the "Orson Herald"</i>
<i>puts out an evening edition.</i>

08:04.698 --> 08:05.537

08:08.407 --> 08:10.957
<i>The next morning, we still</i>
<i>didn't have a front door.</i>

08:12.188 --> 08:14.013
<i>And even though folks</i>
<i>in Orson, Indiana,</i>

08:14.048 --> 08:15.972
<i>brag about never having to</i>
<i>lock their doors,</i>

08:16.343 --> 08:18.764
<i>it's still good to have one</i>
<i>to leave unlocked.</i>

08:18.799 --> 08:20.053
What are we gonna do?

08:20.274 --> 08:22.472
Well, honey, your father says
Axl has to put the door back on,

08:22.552 --> 08:23.803
and I support your father.

08:27.982 --> 08:29.168
You still
don't have a door?

08:29.463 --> 08:31.402
I support your father.

08:31.904 --> 08:32.707
(sighs)
But, <i>mom.</i>

08:33.554 --> 08:35.384
Oh, shoot! My smile!

08:36.397 --> 08:39.511
<i>On cop shows, partners back</i>
<i>each other up no matter what.</i>

08:39.547 --> 08:42.140
<i>Yeah, we probably shouldn't</i>
<i>have made our parenting rules</i>

08:42.174 --> 08:43.369
<i>based on cop shows.</i>

08:43.621 --> 08:44.542
(sighs)

08:44.839 --> 08:47.230
<i>Meanwhile, it was amazing</i>
<i>what the threat of a dog suit</i>

08:47.265 --> 08:49.017
<i>will do to motivate</i>
<i>a sales team.</i>

08:59.775 --> 09:00.265
Ow!

09:00.666 --> 09:02.130
Pete Miller.
How you doing?

09:02.165 --> 09:03.013
(clanging)

09:03.938 --> 09:04.771
(laughs)

09:05.232 --> 09:05.824
(imitates gunshot)

09:06.196 --> 09:07.827
<i>I had to find my game,</i>
<i>and fast.</i>

09:08.054 --> 09:10.313
<i>First I started out</i>
<i>with a tried and true classic.</i>

09:10.594 --> 09:12.975
<i>Bob and I teamed up</i>
<i>for a little good cop/bad cop.</i>

09:13.010 --> 09:14.222
And I completely agree.

09:14.256 --> 09:17.221
I think 15,500 is
a very reasonable offer.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.236
<i>I was the good cop...</i>

09:18.926 --> 09:23.064
$15,500? Are you insane?
That is way too high.

09:23.411 --> 09:24.945
What are you trying to do
to these poor people?

09:25.157 --> 09:27.011
<i>And so, apparently,</i>
<i>was Bob.</i>

09:27.895 --> 09:29.333
(lowered voice)
What are you doing?

09:29.368 --> 09:30.992
You're supposed to be
the bad cop.

09:31.027 --> 09:33.761
No, you're bad cop. You're
helping <i>me</i> sell the car.

09:33.796 --> 09:35.285
No, you're helping <i>me.</i>

09:35.320 --> 09:37.725
Why would I do that?
I spent four years

09:37.760 --> 09:39.079
as the birthday rat
at Chuck E. Cheese.

09:39.114 --> 09:40.625
I can't go back
in a furry head.

09:40.696 --> 09:42.682
(bell clanging)

09:43.215 --> 09:45.473
MAN: <i>Attention,</i>
<i>all sales personnel--</i>

09:46.172 --> 09:49.030
<i>We are out of sugar cubes</i>
<i>in the coffee area.</i>

09:49.413 --> 09:50.977
<i>Plan accordingly.</i>

09:52.394 --> 09:53.958
(dog barks in distance)

09:55.553 --> 09:56.525
(sighs)

10:04.723 --> 10:05.437
Wow.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.622
You must have bought out
the entire store.

10:08.415 --> 10:10.438
Sure.
Let's go with that.

10:11.749 --> 10:14.319
- Thanks, Mom.
- Mm-hmm. Hey.

10:14.469 --> 10:16.035
Oh.
Is that the new picture?

10:16.355 --> 10:18.210
- Well?
- Not good.

10:19.015 --> 10:21.091
Now, now.
Let me be the--

10:21.126 --> 10:23.810
Ooh. Yeah.
No, that is not good.

10:23.845 --> 10:25.579
What even is that face?

10:26.584 --> 10:27.976
I had a blister in my mouth,

10:28.011 --> 10:29.721
and I was feeling it
with my tongue.

10:29.756 --> 10:31.991
Why would you do that
while he's taking the picture?

10:32.589 --> 10:34.871
(sighs)
I just can't stop.

10:35.881 --> 10:36.863
So what do I do now?

10:37.283 --> 10:39.121
I only have
one retake left.

10:39.645 --> 10:41.163
I think
you gotta double down.

10:50.836 --> 10:51.724
Axl.

10:52.757 --> 10:53.372
Dad.

10:53.902 --> 10:56.325
<i>Truth be told, I was getting</i>
<i>a little worried,</i>

10:56.376 --> 10:57.745
<i>'cause when it comes</i>
<i>to being stubborn,</i>

10:57.796 --> 10:59.285
<i>Axl and Mike</i>
<i>had a history.</i>

10:59.417 --> 11:01.391
Axl, you're too old
for a diaper.

11:01.572 --> 11:03.441
You're not leaving there
till you go in the potty.

11:07.798 --> 11:09.252
Fine. I'll wait.

11:09.692 --> 11:10.804
Gotta say "please."

11:12.472 --> 11:14.157
Fine. I'll wait.

11:15.539 --> 11:16.626
Please?

11:17.590 --> 11:19.903
<i>Yep, till now,</i>
<i>Mike would always win,</i>

11:19.938 --> 11:22.729
- <i>but Axl was growing up.</i>
- Fine. I can wait.

11:22.764 --> 11:24.100
I got nothing but time.

11:24.453 --> 11:26.176
<i>Yes, we knew</i>
<i>they both could wait,</i>

11:26.497 --> 11:27.969
<i>but could</i> we?

11:28.681 --> 11:30.208
<i>But I had bigger things</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

11:30.429 --> 11:33.914
<i>Over the next few days, I tried</i>
<i>every sales trick in the book.</i>

11:33.949 --> 11:35.571
<i>I tried being</i>
<i>one of the guys...</i>

11:35.606 --> 11:37.199
Check out the power plant
on this baby.

11:37.234 --> 11:39.318
Step on the accelerator,
she'll throw you back

11:39.353 --> 11:40.927
like a nickel hooker
at a truck stop.

11:41.209 --> 11:43.366
(bell clangs)

11:43.699 --> 11:45.116
<i>I tried being</i>
<i>one of the girls...</i>

11:45.151 --> 11:46.566
I started my period today.

11:47.511 --> 11:49.507
Men--they're distant, huh?

11:49.781 --> 11:51.994
(clanging)

11:53.418 --> 11:55.481
<i>While Mike tried every trick</i>
<i>in his book.</i>

11:55.542 --> 11:57.893
Axl, no door, no TV.

12:01.109 --> 12:01.710
(turns TV off)

12:04.395 --> 12:05.832
No door, no phone.

12:08.315 --> 12:08.995
(beep)

12:11.035 --> 12:13.118
No door, no food.

12:20.679 --> 12:22.186
"No door, no food"?

12:22.277 --> 12:23.807
Yeah, you're right.
That could take weeks.

12:24.159 --> 12:27.367
- No door, no water.
- Wh--are--ugh!

12:27.402 --> 12:30.071
Mike, seriously,
what is your plan here?

12:30.106 --> 12:32.845
Relax. I've got it
all under control.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.148
I don't know that you do.
I mean, what if he never caves?

12:35.370 --> 12:37.631
(whispers) What if he figures
out we have no real power?

12:37.922 --> 12:39.355
What if the sun explodes?

12:39.390 --> 12:41.474
You can worry about it all day,
but it's not gonna happen.

12:41.785 --> 12:43.712
And besides, he's the one
that broke the door.

12:44.020 --> 12:45.268
Pfft. Mm-hmm.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think
it's not his fault?

12:47.508 --> 12:49.064
<i>Careful. Careful.</i>

12:49.099 --> 12:50.932
I'm just saying
that someone

12:50.967 --> 12:53.349
might have been telling
someone for <i>three</i> months

12:53.384 --> 12:56.315
- to replace the hinge.
- Look, Frankie, if we let him win,

12:56.595 --> 12:58.638
things will never be
the same around here.

12:58.673 --> 13:00.376
- Look, I know you're tired--
- I am not tired.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.112
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty much</i>
<i>always tired.</i>

13:02.269 --> 13:05.042
Okay, you say the word,
and we will back off.

13:05.065 --> 13:07.133
What is the word? I'll say it.
I'll say it right now.

13:07.168 --> 13:08.730
There's no word.
We're not backing off.

13:08.765 --> 13:09.407
Fine.

13:10.643 --> 13:12.035
You are so stubborn.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.625
I'll be at work.

13:16.065 --> 13:18.122
Imagine me
slamming the door!

13:30.097 --> 13:31.219
Unbelievable.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.292
Still no sugar cubes.

13:33.788 --> 13:35.393
It's weird.
(chuckles nervously)

13:37.766 --> 13:38.963
(ice rattles)

13:39.227 --> 13:41.796
Ooh.
Pretty warm in there, huh?

13:41.831 --> 13:44.042
Oh, uh,
the heat's not that bad.

13:44.077 --> 13:46.038
The--the stench is
what's hard to take.

13:46.404 --> 13:48.505
It smells like
a rotting carcass

13:48.506 --> 13:51.068
shoved up the butt
of a rotting carcass.

13:51.308 --> 13:54.088
So... pretty unpleasant,
I'm guessing.

13:54.123 --> 13:57.018
On the plus side, the legs
are stiff from dried sweat,

13:57.053 --> 14:00.153
so you can black out in here
and bam! You're still standing.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.441
Mm.
How about that?

14:06.476 --> 14:09.532
You two are just about
the same size. Wow.

14:15.560 --> 14:18.343
<i>Day seven without a door--</i>
<i>or was it day nine?</i>

14:18.562 --> 14:19.552
<i>I had lost track</i>

14:19.597 --> 14:21.399
<i>and the feeling</i>
<i>in my fingertips.</i>

14:21.466 --> 14:24.693
- Can I turn up the heat?
- (sighs) Dad says no.

14:25.313 --> 14:26.946
But I have to take
my picture tomorrow,

14:26.981 --> 14:29.104
- and I'm gonna have a red nose.
- I said I support your father,

14:29.105 --> 14:30.360
and I support your father.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.933
Oh, Brick.
Oh, wow!

14:36.120 --> 14:39.487
You finished it.
Oh, it's beautiful.

14:39.522 --> 14:41.206
I am so proud of you.

14:41.482 --> 14:42.218
Thanks.

14:43.893 --> 14:45.804
What are you doing?

14:45.819 --> 14:47.761
That's your school project.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.355
No, it isn't.
The pyramid was just for fun.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.762
My project's
the State Capitol Building.

14:52.797 --> 14:53.903
It's due tomorrow.

14:54.493 --> 14:54.959
What?

14:55.150 --> 14:57.029
I'm gonna need
some tongue depressors,

14:57.063 --> 15:00.635
1,500 stir sticks and a giant
green styrofoam ball.

15:02.396 --> 15:03.744
Okay.

15:04.210 --> 15:05.540
Here's what's gonna happen--

15:06.812 --> 15:09.030
We're gonna stick a hoosier flag
on top of this thing

15:09.080 --> 15:10.373
and pray for a "C."

15:12.309 --> 15:14.173
If you need me, I'll be
sitting on the space heater.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.082
Who the hell are you?

15:19.363 --> 15:21.632
We wanted to talk to you
about the Kingdom of Jehovah.

15:22.048 --> 15:23.541
There was no door.

15:24.051 --> 15:25.284
Yes, I know.

15:25.846 --> 15:27.793
You know who'd really
love to talk to you--

15:27.828 --> 15:29.656
and please do bring
<i>all</i> your pamphlets--

15:29.690 --> 15:31.976
My husband.
He's out in the garage.

15:36.662 --> 15:38.670
MAN:
<i>Attention, all customers--</i>

15:38.897 --> 15:42.041
<i>Half-hour left</i>
<i>in our fall madness sale.</i>

15:42.100 --> 15:44.086
Okay, Wayne.
What do you think?

15:44.102 --> 15:46.527
I can only offer you this deal
for another 30 minutes.

15:46.562 --> 15:48.294
<i>Attention, all customers--</i>

15:48.873 --> 15:52.294
<i>The winter madness sale</i>
<i>starts in 30 minutes.</i>

15:52.667 --> 15:54.554
Yeah, I don't know.

15:55.379 --> 15:56.586
I'll have to think
about it.

15:56.977 --> 15:59.733
Maybe I'll check back
next week. Thanks.

15:59.882 --> 16:00.897
(sighs)

16:01.662 --> 16:03.000
(bell clanging)

16:03.292 --> 16:06.043
FRANKIE: <i>So that was that.</i>
<i>Bob had made a sale,</i>

16:06.093 --> 16:08.163
<i>and I was still</i>
<i>the only one left at zero.</i>

16:08.457 --> 16:10.907
<i>I guess we knew who'd be</i>
<i>wearing the dog suit.</i>

16:10.942 --> 16:12.046
(mouths words)
I'm sorry.

16:16.275 --> 16:16.796
Hey.

16:17.265 --> 16:18.442
What is that?

16:19.347 --> 16:21.544
You still have mud
on your shoes?

16:21.767 --> 16:24.459
I told you to wipe your shoes
before you got in the car.

16:24.482 --> 16:27.066
And now look, there's mud
all over the floorboard.

16:27.106 --> 16:29.444
I'm sorry.
I j--I wasn't thinking.

16:29.479 --> 16:30.851
No, you weren't,
were you?

16:31.179 --> 16:33.445
And now I've got to clean up
the car. Is that fair?

16:33.480 --> 16:34.880
Should I have to clean up
your mess?

16:35.305 --> 16:36.375
No.

16:36.381 --> 16:38.344
I am just
so disappointed in you.

16:38.574 --> 16:39.127
Me?

16:39.217 --> 16:41.379
Yeah. You wasted a lot
of my time here, Wayne.

16:41.414 --> 16:43.065
And from everything you told me
on our test drive,

16:43.103 --> 16:44.887
this is so typical of you.

16:45.010 --> 16:46.524
You can't decide
if you should buy the car.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.256
You can't decide if you want
to go back to school.

16:48.326 --> 16:49.944
You can't decide
if you should marry Jennifer.

16:50.024 --> 16:53.422
And from the picture
in your wallet, she is adorable!

16:53.949 --> 16:57.255
You have to grow up
and make up your mind.

16:59.207 --> 17:01.102
Okay. I'll take it.

17:02.154 --> 17:02.892
You'll what now?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.231
I'll buy the car.

17:04.473 --> 17:06.617
God.
You sound like my mother.

17:06.976 --> 17:09.730
<i>And there it was--my hook.</i>

17:10.009 --> 17:12.019
<i>It had always been right there</i>
<i>in front of me.</i>

17:12.347 --> 17:15.171
<i>I'm a mom. All I had to do</i>
<i>was tap into it.</i>

17:15.172 --> 17:16.917
(clanging)

17:18.887 --> 17:20.425
Aah!

17:29.539 --> 17:31.704
Great news!
Guess what I did t--

17:33.501 --> 17:34.677
Oh, come on!

17:37.195 --> 17:38.561
I sold a car.

17:42.214 --> 17:42.977
(sighs)

17:47.379 --> 17:49.148
Well, well, well.

17:49.604 --> 17:51.044
What have we here?

17:53.605 --> 17:54.989
You put the door
back on.

17:55.120 --> 17:55.889
Good boy.

17:56.744 --> 17:58.865
No. I didn't.

18:00.091 --> 18:01.100
I did it.

18:01.482 --> 18:02.163
(drill whirs)

18:02.426 --> 18:04.914
You did it?
You put the door back,

18:04.929 --> 18:07.390
partner?
(scoffs) That's it.

18:07.425 --> 18:08.385
It's coming back off.

18:10.134 --> 18:12.513
Don't... you... dare.

18:12.636 --> 18:13.861
(whirs)

18:14.305 --> 18:15.387
(whirs)

18:16.941 --> 18:18.517
(laughs)

18:18.609 --> 18:21.181
Hey. I think now
would be a good time

18:21.216 --> 18:22.374
to go do
your homework.

18:22.463 --> 18:23.666
(whirs)

18:23.948 --> 18:26.898
Frankie, give me the drill.
Come on. Hand it over.

18:26.950 --> 18:28.895
<i>How did I end up</i>
<i>in a standoff with Mike?</i>

18:29.489 --> 18:30.735
<i>We'd always been</i>
<i>on the same page</i>

18:30.775 --> 18:33.335
<i>when it came to--</i>
<i>Well, just about everything,</i>

18:33.721 --> 18:34.890
<i>Except "Caddyshack."</i>

18:35.387 --> 18:37.369
(laughs)

18:41.722 --> 18:42.597
(sighs)

18:47.803 --> 18:49.075
Thanks for the backup, pal.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.649
Listen, there are all different
kinds of backup, Mike,

18:52.684 --> 18:55.264
like when your partner loses
his mind, and you gotta step in

18:55.299 --> 18:57.140
and knock some freaking sense
into him!

18:57.779 --> 18:59.544
Remember the time you grew
the Tom Selleck mustache

18:59.613 --> 19:02.020
and I had to shave it off
in your sleep? Backup.

19:02.228 --> 19:02.858
So what now?

19:02.878 --> 19:04.876
Axl walks free with more
of a sense of entitlement

19:04.937 --> 19:05.804
than he already had?

19:05.873 --> 19:07.758
We were this close, Frankie,
this close.

19:07.793 --> 19:09.224
To getting robbed
in our sleep?

19:10.457 --> 19:12.642
Okay, here it is--
the last picture.

19:13.159 --> 19:14.368
Oh, hey, the door's back.

19:15.761 --> 19:16.092
(sighs)

19:16.127 --> 19:18.262
I was too nervous to look,
but I think it might be okay.

19:18.765 --> 19:20.420
Maybe. I don't know.
You look first.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.733
Oh, honey.

19:26.339 --> 19:29.637
- It is wonderful!
- Really? Honest?

19:30.086 --> 19:32.979
Man, you look beautiful.
The third time's a charm.

19:33.279 --> 19:35.384
<i>And sometimes,</i>
<i>without any discussion,</i>

19:35.481 --> 19:37.974
<i>you find yourself</i>
<i>back on the same page.</i>

19:38.226 --> 19:40.328
Yes! I nailed it.
(laughs)

19:42.618 --> 19:43.821
(door opens)

19:43.855 --> 19:45.274
Oh, my lord!

19:45.309 --> 19:46.848
(both laughing)

19:46.883 --> 19:50.023
I have never seen her make
that expression in my life.

19:50.058 --> 19:50.959
What is that?

19:51.996 --> 19:53.926
Three tries.
She had three tries.

19:54.031 --> 19:55.753
- She's consistent.
- Oh!

19:55.788 --> 19:56.518
Oh, Sue.

19:58.362 --> 20:01.064
- Hey. I sold a car today.
- You're kidding!

20:01.171 --> 20:03.111
- Yeah! That's amazing.
- I know.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.575
Oh, hey. You're gonna think
of an awful punishment for Axl.

20:06.609 --> 20:08.060
An <i>awful</i> one.

20:08.177 --> 20:11.181
I will. I will.
I'm not as brilliant as you,

20:11.504 --> 20:12.951
but I will come up
with something.

20:18.268 --> 20:19.890
This is totally unfair!

20:23.843 --> 20:24.531
Genius.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.717
<i>Yep, everything was</i>
<i>as it should be.</i>

20:28.914 --> 20:32.191
<i>I had a commission, a door.</i>
<i>They even gave me my own desk.</i>

20:38.267 --> 20:41.241
<i>I was Frankie Heck,</i>
<i>sales mom.</i>

20:42.332 --> 20:43.814
<i>Look out, world.</i>
