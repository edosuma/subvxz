02:49.615 --> 02:51.575
Hurry up. We are leaving soon.

02:52.951 --> 02:54.161
Helen.

03:44.211 --> 03:45.963
Off to a premiere, are we?

03:48.757 --> 03:50.968
Come on. We haven't got all day.

03:53.787 --> 03:55.371
Suit yourself.

03:58.392 --> 04:01.728
<i># It won't be a stylish marriage #</i>

04:02.563 --> 04:05.858
<i># I can't afford a carriage #</i>

04:06.984 --> 04:10.487
<i># But you'll look sweet upon the seat #</i>

04:10.571 --> 04:14.074
<i># Of a bicycle built for two... #</i>

04:16.243 --> 04:18.495
This might be worth something one day.

05:06.335 --> 05:07.753
Aren't they pretty?

05:12.591 --> 05:13.967
It's George's birthday.

05:15.719 --> 05:19.932
- He would have been 40 today.
- Take them away.

05:27.981 --> 05:32.653
Anyway, you shouldn't pick wild flowers.
It spoils it for everyone else.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.488
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

06:24.705 --> 06:27.165
- Come along.
- Okay, everyone on the coach now, please.

06:27.624 --> 06:32.838
Let's stay together, please.
Good. Take your time.

06:32.921 --> 06:33.922
Nice and slowly.

06:34.006 --> 06:36.550
- Ladies, this way.
- Derek, we've got to stay together.

06:38.176 --> 06:41.555
And where do you think
you are going? Get back here!

06:41.638 --> 06:45.892
- Hello. Can I drive?
- For the 100th time, no, Reg.

06:45.976 --> 06:49.688
Just get on and sit down like everyone else.

06:49.771 --> 06:51.189
- What about on the way...?
- Reg.

06:51.898 --> 06:55.110
- What are these?
- Biscuits.

06:55.193 --> 06:56.862
I thought we'd try something different.

06:56.945 --> 07:00.741
Well, put them back. I don't want them.
They're far too expensive.

07:02.784 --> 07:04.036
I said put them back.

07:05.370 --> 07:07.706
- Apparently, we don't want these.
- Don't you worry.

07:08.957 --> 07:11.418
Some people don't know what
they're missing. Would you like a bag?

07:13.253 --> 07:15.547
Hurry up! You are keeping everyone waiting.

07:15.631 --> 07:18.300
Oh, excuse me.

07:19.301 --> 07:20.302
Hello?

07:21.678 --> 07:25.057
- You dropped your purse.
- There's nothing in it.

07:26.099 --> 07:27.476
Do you need a hand?

07:28.560 --> 07:31.396
- I thought you'd never ask. Here.
- There.

07:32.522 --> 07:33.857
Put it out!

07:35.984 --> 07:38.779
We will have to have
at least one toilet stop.

07:38.862 --> 07:40.113
- Uh...
- Probably two.

07:40.197 --> 07:43.408
And please drive safely. Yes.

07:43.492 --> 07:45.035
What?

07:45.118 --> 07:46.828
Shut the door. Let's start.

07:46.912 --> 07:48.747
- Can I drive?
- No, Reg.

07:50.540 --> 07:51.875
Thanks.

07:53.335 --> 07:55.420
- Oh!
- What the...

07:56.129 --> 07:59.383
Excuse me. Excuse me,
can you stop the bus, please?

07:59.466 --> 08:01.218
What about on the way back?

08:01.301 --> 08:04.054
- This is a mistake. I need to get off.
- So do I.

08:04.137 --> 08:06.473
- Sit down!
- Sit down!

08:10.143 --> 08:13.146
- Why on earth did you get on?
- I was helping you.

08:13.230 --> 08:15.899
Oh! See where that got you.

08:17.484 --> 08:20.737
- Where are we going?
- A day at the seaside.

08:21.613 --> 08:24.282
- But I can't.
- Well, you are now.

08:27.369 --> 08:29.705
I'm gonna drown myself when I get there.

08:36.837 --> 08:40.298
- I need the loo!
- So do I!

08:41.258 --> 08:44.344
Don't argue. Don't eat any sweets.

08:44.428 --> 08:47.180
- Out, out, out.
- Your mother's disappeared.

08:47.264 --> 08:49.307
- Where is she?
- She went off on a coach.

08:49.391 --> 08:51.601
- Why?
- How should I know?

08:51.685 --> 08:55.772
- I've got to get to work.
- What am I to do with these two?

08:55.856 --> 08:58.984
Think of something.
She'll be back soon. I've gotta go!

09:09.494 --> 09:11.037
- Hello?
- Polly.

09:11.121 --> 09:14.124
I'm in a service station.
Will you get me Granddad?

09:14.207 --> 09:17.461
He's very cross. When are you coming back?

09:17.544 --> 09:20.464
Soon, soon. I've got to go now. Oh, God.

09:20.547 --> 09:22.549
You idiot! Where are you?

09:22.632 --> 09:25.135
Th-There's ham in the fridge, Frank.

09:27.387 --> 09:30.390
Stop! Stop! It's me!

09:30.724 --> 09:31.600
Stop!

09:33.101 --> 09:34.561
It's me!

09:40.609 --> 09:42.178
Hurry up!

09:48.533 --> 09:49.910
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

09:49.993 --> 09:51.953
I got on your coach earlier by mistake

09:52.037 --> 09:55.207
and I was wondering
if I could stay with you today

09:55.290 --> 09:58.168
and then come back with you.
If that's alright.

09:59.711 --> 10:02.297
- Yes, of course it's alright.
- Thank you.

10:02.380 --> 10:03.840
- Come on.
- Thank you.

10:04.883 --> 10:06.301
Senile old granny!

10:06.885 --> 10:07.886
Let's go.

10:08.762 --> 10:11.640
- Can I drive?
- No, Reg.

10:24.861 --> 10:26.488
I can see the sea.

10:28.615 --> 10:33.620
- I told you it'd be worth it.
- I haven't been to the seaside for years.

10:33.703 --> 10:38.834
- Why not?
- Oh, you know... long way.

10:42.629 --> 10:48.552
- Your husband doesn't like to travel?
- Not anymore. He's dead.

10:49.970 --> 10:52.848
- Really?
- Yes.

10:56.810 --> 10:58.436
I was sorry to see him go.

11:03.149 --> 11:08.113
Helen. The only sane one on the bus.
Apart from you, hopefully.

11:09.072 --> 11:11.449
Priscilla. Nice to meet you.

11:26.548 --> 11:28.466
- I like piers.
- I don't.

11:28.550 --> 11:29.884
Brings back memories.

11:31.177 --> 11:35.682
Smile, everybody.
You're on holiday. It's beautiful.

11:36.808 --> 11:38.268
The weather is good, no?

11:38.351 --> 11:41.521
There's something awfully familiar
about you. Have we met before?

11:41.605 --> 11:44.983
- I doubt it.
- Come on, keep up.

11:45.066 --> 11:47.986
I need a drink. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

11:49.696 --> 11:52.574
No, no, no. Not in the sea!

11:52.657 --> 11:57.996
<i># It was fascination #</i>

11:58.079 --> 12:00.999
<i># I know #</i>

12:01.875 --> 12:05.337
<i># And it might have ended right then... #</i>

12:05.420 --> 12:06.421
Thank you.

12:12.761 --> 12:17.057
- I'm afraid I'm a little short.
- Oh. Of course.

12:21.561 --> 12:23.063
There we are.

12:28.193 --> 12:31.738
- I don't normally drink in the day.
- This isn't normally.

12:33.782 --> 12:36.618
- To us.
- To us.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.331
"I'll give ya five seconds
to get out of my sight,

12:41.414 --> 12:44.167
otherwise I'm gonna put a bullet
where the sun don't shine."

12:44.250 --> 12:47.962
- What?
- "I've got Morty just where I want him

12:48.046 --> 12:52.133
and I am not about to let him off the hook."

12:52.217 --> 12:54.052
- Morty & Me.
- Yes.

12:56.471 --> 12:59.516
- <i># La la la la #</i>
- <i># Morty and me #</i>

12:59.599 --> 13:04.062
<i># We were always intended to be
intended to be #</i>

13:04.145 --> 13:07.691
<i># Me and Morty #</i>

13:07.774 --> 13:10.360
<i># Morty and me #</i>

13:10.443 --> 13:12.278
<i># Doo doo #</i>

13:13.062 --> 13:16.241
My God. You're Helen Shelly.

13:17.409 --> 13:18.868
- Guilty.
- I'm so excited.

13:18.952 --> 13:22.080
I've never met a real film star before.

13:23.039 --> 13:27.127
I thought you were wonderful.
I'm your biggest fan.

13:27.210 --> 13:33.591
Oh, well, that's wonderful because
I really need you to help me, Priscilla.

13:33.675 --> 13:37.512
- My help?
- Yes. Take a look at this.

13:43.059 --> 13:46.396
"Jerry Standing,
celebrated British film director,

13:46.479 --> 13:52.110
died peacefully on the 5th of July
at home in France.

13:52.193 --> 13:56.948
Funeral, 10th of July,
La Flotte, Île de Ré, France."

13:57.031 --> 14:02.996
Oh, he was such a great friend
and a wonderful, wonderful director.

14:03.079 --> 14:06.040
And I really need
to say goodbye to him properly.

14:06.124 --> 14:07.876
- Of course you do.
- Yes.

14:09.878 --> 14:12.881
- Well, I can't go on my own, can I?
- No.

14:12.964 --> 14:16.885
- Why not?
- I'll never make it.

14:16.968 --> 14:20.013
- I need you to help me.
- I can't go to France.

14:20.096 --> 14:23.141
- Why not? You've come this far.
- Yeah, but that was by mistake.

14:23.224 --> 14:27.604
That's how the best things happen.
Listen, can you keep a secret?

14:28.646 --> 14:30.690
I am not that famous anymore.

14:31.483 --> 14:33.902
- You thought I was dead, didn't you?
- No.

14:35.528 --> 14:37.363
Listen, Priscilla...

14:38.698 --> 14:42.494
I'm broke. I have nothing.

14:42.577 --> 14:46.539
And actresses cannot get old in Hollywood.

14:46.623 --> 14:49.751
You see, this funeral is my last chance.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.753
Everybody in Hollywood is going to be there.

14:51.836 --> 14:55.507
Heads of studios, agents,
producers, directors.

14:55.590 --> 14:59.010
It'll be... it'll be like the Academy Awards.

15:00.470 --> 15:02.222
A little sadder but not much.

15:02.305 --> 15:05.058
I'm going to reinvent myself.
Out of the ashes.

15:05.141 --> 15:10.146
I am not going to go back to that home.
I'd rather sleep rough.

15:10.897 --> 15:17.028
- You and I, we could have an adventure.
- I know, but I can't.

15:19.279 --> 15:20.993
Course you can't.

15:21.074 --> 15:23.618
If you could wait another few days
while I organized myself,

15:23.701 --> 15:25.245
then maybe I could come then.

15:25.328 --> 15:28.164
Yeah, too late.
He'll be in the ground in three days.

15:28.248 --> 15:30.375
It's just such short notice.

15:30.458 --> 15:35.338
Yeah, well, unlike you,
I have not yet given up.

15:36.214 --> 15:38.967
Ah, well, go back to your husband, then.

15:39.050 --> 15:42.846
Oh, I forgot. He's dead.

15:42.929 --> 15:45.598
Have a nice life. What's left of it.

15:47.809 --> 15:48.852
Helen?

16:28.933 --> 16:32.312
Um, excuse me.
I wonder could I borrow a phone?

16:32.395 --> 16:35.857
I seem to have lost my purse
with all my money in it.

16:36.858 --> 16:38.484
Thanks.

16:38.568 --> 16:40.445
- Press zero first.
- Thank you.

16:48.745 --> 16:50.371
- Hello?
- Frank.

16:50.455 --> 16:51.998
You'll never guess who I just met.

16:52.081 --> 16:55.293
- Where the hell are you?
- Helen Shelly.

16:55.376 --> 16:58.004
She wanted me to go to a funeral in France.

16:58.087 --> 17:01.007
- France?
- All of Hollywood will be there.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.469
Frank, would you have minded
if I'd have gone?

17:04.551 --> 17:06.179
Are you going senile?

17:06.262 --> 17:09.390
- No.
- Then come home!

17:11.768 --> 17:13.102
Yes, of course.

17:14.436 --> 17:15.771
I'll be home soon.

17:17.815 --> 17:18.942
Sorry.

17:24.781 --> 17:26.782
- Get on. Sit down.
- Sorry.

17:51.099 --> 17:52.267
Stop the bus!

17:53.851 --> 17:55.395
Oh!

17:56.688 --> 17:58.231
Come on. Help me get her.

17:58.314 --> 18:00.525
- Helen, where are you...
- You're hurting me!

18:00.608 --> 18:02.485
- Get on the bus.
- Get off me!

18:02.568 --> 18:04.529
- I am not going back in there!
- Helen!

18:04.612 --> 18:07.657
- You can't make me.
- I'm trying to help you.

18:07.740 --> 18:10.827
- Get on and shut up!
- Get off me!

18:10.910 --> 18:13.121
- She doesn't want to come back.
- You're hurting me.

18:13.204 --> 18:15.665
Get back to your seat, Reg!
Get back to your seat!

18:15.748 --> 18:17.667
Leave her alone.

18:17.750 --> 18:18.876
You're okay.

18:21.587 --> 18:23.464
No, no, no, no!

18:23.548 --> 18:25.925
- Where are we going?
- Come on, Reg!

18:26.009 --> 18:28.636
- Reg, open the door!
- The ferry.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.847
- Open the door!
- Rightio.

18:30.930 --> 18:32.807
Reg! Reg!

18:32.890 --> 18:34.393
Hold on to your hats.

18:40.315 --> 18:42.442
- Stop!
- Stop, stop!

18:42.525 --> 18:45.236
He's stolen my bus! Call the police!

18:47.572 --> 18:50.283
Oh, my God.
We're gonna be in terrible trouble.

18:51.159 --> 18:52.785
Of course we are.

18:57.123 --> 18:58.708
Remind me where we're going.

19:00.251 --> 19:01.544
The ferry terminal.

19:01.627 --> 19:03.504
Hold on tight.

19:04.797 --> 19:08.092
Golly. Oh, God! Reg!

19:08.843 --> 19:11.012
This one, Reg! This one!

19:12.055 --> 19:16.100
- God! Reg!
- Sorry! One more time.

19:18.311 --> 19:21.314
- I'm gonna be sick.
- You're coming with me?

19:21.397 --> 19:24.484
- Yes.
- I knew you would.

19:38.748 --> 19:40.750
- Slow down, Reg.
- I'm trying!

19:41.793 --> 19:43.711
Slow down, Reg!

19:43.795 --> 19:46.631
For God's sakes.
We're going too fast, Reg. Slow down.

19:46.714 --> 19:49.092
- My foot's stuck.
- Well, get it off.

19:49.175 --> 19:50.635
I can't. It's gone to sleep.

19:52.553 --> 19:54.305
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

19:54.389 --> 19:56.641
I'm gonna get it off. I'm gonna get it off.

19:58.393 --> 20:00.144
- Watch out!
- Come on.

20:12.573 --> 20:14.409
- God, we did it.
- Well done, Reg!

20:14.492 --> 20:15.868
Come on. Quick.

20:15.952 --> 20:18.037
Let's get out of here before they stop us.

20:18.121 --> 20:19.414
- Move it.
- I am.

20:19.497 --> 20:22.542
- Good luck. That was fun.
- Yes.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.880
We need to get tickets.

20:27.964 --> 20:32.009
We haven't got time.
Just keep moving. Act old.

20:32.093 --> 20:33.594
30, 31...

20:33.678 --> 20:35.471
- Move it.
- 32...

20:35.555 --> 20:40.435
- Excuse me.
- 33, 34, 35, 36...

20:41.894 --> 20:44.230
- Sorry, are you part of the group?
- Yes, yes.

20:44.313 --> 20:46.566
Are you sure? Everyone has gone through now.

20:46.649 --> 20:48.484
I thought I was.

20:48.568 --> 20:50.278
Now what are we going to do?

20:50.361 --> 20:54.240
You don't know me. Whatever happens,
just keep moving, okay?

20:54.323 --> 20:55.825
Yes.

20:57.001 --> 21:00.496
Oh, Helen. Oh, my God! Are you alright?

21:00.580 --> 21:04.041
- Get off.
- Uh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Um...

21:05.334 --> 21:09.380
I think she fainted. I've no idea
who she is, but she does look familiar.

21:10.423 --> 21:12.717
Madam? Madam?

21:13.885 --> 21:16.596
- Can you hear me?
- Course I can hear you.

21:16.679 --> 21:19.056
You're screaming in my bloody ear. Here.

21:20.183 --> 21:21.976
Help me up.

21:28.316 --> 21:31.068
- We did it. I can't believe it.
- No thanks to you.

21:31.152 --> 21:32.904
- What do you mean?
- Where's the bar?

21:32.987 --> 21:34.530
I'm doing my best.

21:47.710 --> 21:52.715
- So, when did your husband pass away?
- Sorry?

21:53.758 --> 21:55.760
When did he die?

21:56.719 --> 21:58.804
Oh... a long time ago.

21:59.931 --> 22:01.015
Hmm.

22:01.807 --> 22:03.392
What was he like?

22:04.936 --> 22:06.270
Quite nice.

22:08.356 --> 22:10.316
- Really?
- Well...

22:13.736 --> 22:15.154
What's the matter?

22:15.863 --> 22:17.281
Cheer up.

22:19.534 --> 22:25.748
Um, I think I need a bit of fresh air.
I'm gonna... watch us leave.

22:26.791 --> 22:29.085
That's fine. I'm not going anywhere.

22:33.589 --> 22:36.300
I don't understand, Dad. Where is she?

22:36.384 --> 22:40.471
- I've told you. She's gone to France.
- She must have said more than that.

22:40.554 --> 22:43.724
To help Helen Shelly.
They're going to a funeral, apparently.

22:43.808 --> 22:46.811
- Who's Helen Shelly?
- Don't you know anything?

22:46.894 --> 22:51.357
She was a film star in the '60s.
Went off the rails. Was a drunk.

22:51.440 --> 22:52.858
I'm sure she's dead.

22:54.443 --> 22:57.488
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Yeah, that's your mother.

22:58.155 --> 22:59.448
I'm calling the police.

22:59.532 --> 23:02.326
- There's no need for that.
- Yes, there is.

23:19.302 --> 23:22.221
You're slower than me
and I'm a cripple. Come on.

23:22.305 --> 23:24.098
We'll be in the ground soon enough.

23:25.725 --> 23:28.311
- Come on.
- I'd like my purse back, please.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.940
I saw it in your handbag
and I'd like it back, please. Now.

23:33.024 --> 23:36.444
- So I can go home.
- Don't be stupid.

23:36.527 --> 23:38.112
- You can't go now.
- Eric!

23:39.447 --> 23:41.907
- Eric!
- Oh.

23:41.991 --> 23:44.035
Eric!

23:44.118 --> 23:45.661
Oh! Oh, my God!

23:45.745 --> 23:46.996
Eric!

23:47.079 --> 23:48.289
Oh, God!

23:50.082 --> 23:51.709
Priscilla, what are you doing?

23:54.128 --> 23:55.963
- What are you doing?
- Eric!

23:56.881 --> 23:57.923
Stop it!

24:11.187 --> 24:13.981
- I've got you.
- Oh, my God!

24:14.065 --> 24:15.649
You'll be okay.

24:55.272 --> 25:00.319
Priscilla, wake up. We are going to be on TV.

25:00.403 --> 25:04.073
You are a hero,
but we've got to leave right now.

25:04.156 --> 25:05.157
Who are you?

25:06.492 --> 25:10.037
Well, I'm Helen Shelly, for God's sakes.

25:10.121 --> 25:11.372
Is the little boy alright?

25:11.455 --> 25:15.126
Yes, he's fine. He won't be
going swimming again in a hurry.

25:16.377 --> 25:18.170
- Oh, dear.
- What is it?

25:20.172 --> 25:26.720
- It's just... It was a shock.
- Yes, of course, but cheer up.

25:26.804 --> 25:31.684
I mean, you saved his life.
You deserve to be celebrated.

25:31.767 --> 25:33.853
- Do I?
- Yes. And so do I.

25:35.771 --> 25:37.815
You will stay, won't you?

25:37.898 --> 25:40.734
I don't know what I'd do without you.

25:43.028 --> 25:45.865
And I've got another bit
of good news for you.

25:46.740 --> 25:53.456
I found your purse. It was just caught
up in the lining of your jacket pocket.

25:56.542 --> 26:01.338
Do try to be more careful.
This is all so exciting.

26:01.422 --> 26:02.756
Now, come on.

26:20.528 --> 26:21.866
Madame?

26:23.569 --> 26:27.615
What a brave thing to do for anyone,
but, if you forgive me, at your age?

26:27.698 --> 26:31.535
- You must be a very confident swimmer.
- No. No, not really.

26:31.619 --> 26:38.042
Such a pleasure to be here in France
and you've always been so loyal to me.

26:38.125 --> 26:40.669
- What made you do it?
- I...

26:40.753 --> 26:43.005
Well, it's so lovely to be back.

26:43.088 --> 26:46.091
I'm so glad to see
that I haven't been forgotten.

26:46.175 --> 26:47.885
She's better at this than I am.

26:49.178 --> 26:51.764
I don't understand.
Who rescued the little boy?

26:51.847 --> 26:54.099
I did, but this

26:54.183 --> 26:55.434
is Helen Shelly.

26:56.644 --> 26:59.772
She's a film star. Morty & Me?

26:59.855 --> 27:01.190
She played Me.

27:02.274 --> 27:05.402
- Not me me but the character Me.
- Stop.

27:05.486 --> 27:08.948
She's the one you should be talking to.
She's back, she's ready for work,

27:09.031 --> 27:11.116
she's looking for a job.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.161
She's got a bad hip,
but she's a fantastic actress.

27:15.496 --> 27:19.625
They're not interested in me.
It's you they want to talk to.

27:19.708 --> 27:22.044
- She's the real film star.
- Thank you.

27:22.127 --> 27:25.923
It was lovely to meet you all,
but we must be going.

27:26.006 --> 27:30.135
We don't want to tire her out
after her dip in the Channel.

27:30.219 --> 27:32.555
You are humiliating me.

27:32.638 --> 27:34.890
Let's be going.
They're not interested in me at all.

27:34.974 --> 27:36.369
Wait!

27:39.770 --> 27:42.273
I wanted to thank you so much.

27:42.356 --> 27:45.401
Come on, what do you say? Go ahead.

27:45.484 --> 27:48.821
It doesn't matter.
He doesn't have to say anything.

27:48.904 --> 27:52.825
Yes, yes, he wants to.
Go on, what do you say?

27:52.908 --> 27:55.160
- Thank you.
- It's not his fault.

27:55.244 --> 27:57.830
It's your fault. Your fault.

27:57.913 --> 28:02.668
You... you should be more careful.
You must never take your eyes off him.

28:02.751 --> 28:05.212
- But it was an accident.
- No such thing as an accident.

28:05.296 --> 28:10.009
I should know. No accident, madame. I know.

28:11.385 --> 28:16.265
J'ai suis désolée,
mais... us... us... on y vas.

28:22.396 --> 28:25.733
- Priscilla, wait for me.
- I'm going home.

28:26.734 --> 28:28.444
Scurrying back to your husband?

28:30.779 --> 28:32.948
Why did you lie?

28:33.032 --> 28:35.492
How dare you presume to know about me?

28:35.576 --> 28:37.995
Because I watched you both
in the supermarket.

28:38.078 --> 28:39.705
The happy couple.

28:39.788 --> 28:42.791
You let him walk all over you
for a packet of biscuits.

28:42.875 --> 28:47.004
Your precious husband is just
a nasty bully and you wish he was dead.

28:47.087 --> 28:48.255
And what are you?

28:50.633 --> 28:52.760
How did you lose your child?

28:57.222 --> 28:59.058
He drowned, Helen.

28:59.808 --> 29:01.268
That's how I lost him.

29:02.978 --> 29:04.855
You see? I knew it.

29:04.939 --> 29:07.107
We are the same, you and I. We are the same.

29:07.191 --> 29:08.525
We're not the same.

29:08.609 --> 29:11.737
- We are, Priscilla. We are.
- I'm going home.

29:14.949 --> 29:18.452
Reclusive disgraced former
Hollywood bad girl Helen Shelly

29:18.535 --> 29:21.997
has emerged from hiding in France
after hijacking a coach...

29:22.081 --> 29:24.208
- Grandma!
- Grandma?

29:24.291 --> 29:27.086
On disembarking from the ferry in Caen,

29:27.169 --> 29:29.546
Helen helped save
a French toddler from drowning,

29:29.630 --> 29:32.967
along with her friend,
a British pensioner, Priscilla Williams.

29:33.050 --> 29:37.179
Mrs. Williams jumped into the sea
to rescue the toddler who had fallen in.

29:37.721 --> 29:40.849
Then, in a reunion
with the child and his parents,

29:40.933 --> 29:42.893
started to blame them for the accident.

29:42.977 --> 29:47.731
It's not an accident. No such thing.
I should know. No such thing.

29:48.315 --> 29:50.985
A strange end to a remarkable story

29:51.068 --> 29:53.237
that has captured the heart of France.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.656
Now back to the studio for the latest news.

30:21.414 --> 30:22.850
Oh, God.

30:36.822 --> 30:41.368
Hello. One foot passenger to England, please.

30:46.749 --> 30:49.001
Hello! Stop.

30:55.215 --> 30:56.216
Hello!

31:00.054 --> 31:01.805
Merci beaucoup. Merci.

31:01.889 --> 31:04.308
Monsieur, je veux un lift.

31:04.391 --> 31:07.102
Île de Ré, s'il vous plaît. Île de Ré?

31:07.186 --> 31:08.937
Un lift pour moi.

31:09.021 --> 31:12.107
Je suis grande movie star! "Morty et Moi"!

31:12.191 --> 31:14.318
All I want is a fucking lift!

31:14.401 --> 31:17.863
Hi. Do you want to stop for me?

31:17.946 --> 31:19.531
Fucking kids.

31:19.615 --> 31:24.745
Île de Ré. Uh, c'est far? Un lift pour moi.

31:25.537 --> 31:26.538
Arrête!

31:27.748 --> 31:29.124
Por favor!

31:29.208 --> 31:30.793
Please! S'il vous plaît!

31:34.713 --> 31:36.548
For Christ's sakes!

31:40.177 --> 31:42.805
Taxi! Taxi!

31:42.888 --> 31:45.849
Oh, merci. Merci. Taxi.

31:55.776 --> 31:58.153
- You didn't get very far.
- Neither did you.

31:59.113 --> 32:00.405
Where are we going?

32:00.489 --> 32:04.993
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving. Let's go, monsieur.

32:19.258 --> 32:21.260
Why'd you come back?

32:24.346 --> 32:26.014
Because you were right.

32:27.683 --> 32:29.601
I do sometimes wish Frank were dead.

32:29.685 --> 32:33.272
- Why?
- He blames me for George's death.

32:34.815 --> 32:36.525
He's never forgiven me.

32:43.198 --> 32:45.951
He was only four, George.

32:47.119 --> 32:50.998
And we used to picnic by the river.
He loved it.

32:52.082 --> 32:54.585
Frank never came. He was always too busy.

32:56.336 --> 32:57.671
And...

33:00.174 --> 33:04.887
I... I only... I only turned my back
for one second.

33:04.970 --> 33:09.016
The baby was crying, Sarah. And he was gone.

33:11.101 --> 33:12.686
He'd jumped in.

33:15.272 --> 33:17.357
He thought he could swim.

33:20.194 --> 33:23.155
I went in after him, of course,
but it was too late.

33:27.576 --> 33:33.624
Frank refuses to talk about it.
Maybe that's why I came back.

33:35.459 --> 33:38.378
I needed a break and then...

33:39.338 --> 33:40.380
I can carry on.

33:42.132 --> 33:44.760
It's important to keep carrying on, isn't it?

33:47.346 --> 33:51.683
I did not come all this way
just to carry on and neither did you.

33:52.893 --> 33:57.981
I want another chance at it. At life.

33:58.690 --> 34:00.442
Don't you?

34:05.489 --> 34:09.534
Right. Let's go and get you a job, then.

34:15.666 --> 34:17.042
Can you drive?

34:17.125 --> 34:19.710
Yes, but I haven't for years.
Anyway, it's closed.

34:32.431 --> 34:34.309
This is a really bad idea.

34:34.393 --> 34:38.647
It's not a problem. This is a car rental.
We'll pay them later.

34:38.730 --> 34:40.690
Where are your balls, woman?

34:48.907 --> 34:50.826
Oh, my God. They're gonna stop us.

34:50.909 --> 34:55.163
Nah, they won't. We're just
two old ladies going for a drive.

34:56.415 --> 34:57.708
A very slow drive.

34:59.293 --> 35:01.795
- Bonjour, big boy.
- Helen.

35:02.963 --> 35:06.049
There are some benefits
to being a senior citizen.

35:06.133 --> 35:10.762
Now, step on it, baby.
Île de Ré, here we come.

35:15.767 --> 35:19.313
You'll need to get out of second gear
if we're to get to this funeral on time.

35:23.817 --> 35:26.820
- What's he doing?
- We're on the wrong side of the road!

35:37.497 --> 35:39.499
I should be back in the home.

35:41.543 --> 35:43.378
When did you last take a driving lesson?

35:43.462 --> 35:45.922
- Don't ask.
- Don't ask?

35:46.006 --> 35:50.302
Don't talk to me.
I'm just going to turn in a minute.

35:50.385 --> 35:52.054
Oh, well done.

35:52.137 --> 35:56.641
- You're in charge of satnav.
- God, this thing is so fiddly.

35:56.725 --> 35:57.976
There.

36:04.149 --> 36:06.818
- It's in French.
- Can you change it into English?

36:06.902 --> 36:08.070
No.

36:10.364 --> 36:13.241
- No, no, no! I went the wrong way!
- Go right.

36:13.325 --> 36:16.953
- Stay on the right.
- I am right now. I'm right. I did it.

36:19.164 --> 36:20.415
Second exit?

36:20.499 --> 36:22.626
- You just missed it.
- Okay.

36:22.709 --> 36:25.962
- Oh, God.
- I like roundabouts.

36:28.173 --> 36:30.175
- Keep right.
- I am.

36:32.219 --> 36:34.971
- I think I'm getting the hang of it now.
- Thank God for that.

36:39.017 --> 36:41.853
Six hours. That's not too bad.

37:57.304 --> 38:01.016
- Are we there yet?
- No. I've no idea where we are.

38:02.893 --> 38:05.979
- Why have we stopped?
- I think we've run out of petrol.

38:06.462 --> 38:10.233
I don't believe it.
Isn't that an elementary mistake?

38:10.317 --> 38:13.778
- And what was I supposed to do?
- Stop and buy some.

38:13.862 --> 38:16.698
In a stolen car
and I haven't driven for 20 years.

38:16.781 --> 38:18.658
Oh, I forgot. You fell asleep.

38:18.742 --> 38:21.411
- Yeah, well, I was tired.
- I'm tired.

38:21.495 --> 38:25.999
I'm so exhausted I could barely drive.
I'm trying to get you to this funeral.

38:26.082 --> 38:28.293
Yeah, well, it'll be my funeral at this rate.

38:28.876 --> 38:30.337
What do we do now?

38:30.420 --> 38:33.715
How should I know?
I don't have all the answers.

38:33.798 --> 38:37.385
So now might be a good time
for you to start thinking for yourself.

38:39.763 --> 38:42.098
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinking for myself.

38:42.182 --> 38:43.683
We need help.

38:43.767 --> 38:47.979
- Well, look, I can't walk anywhere.
- Well, you stay there and I will go.

38:48.063 --> 38:52.609
Don't worry about me. I'll be just fine.

38:53.693 --> 38:57.948
Hey, hold your horses.
Don't forget, I'm disabled here!

38:59.157 --> 39:02.035
Priscilla. I was just joking.

39:02.118 --> 39:06.039
Come on. Come on, let's be friends again!

39:07.499 --> 39:12.546
Come on. I've lost my stick. This is cruelty.

39:21.221 --> 39:23.265
Oh, God.

39:27.894 --> 39:29.354
Priscilla?

39:30.063 --> 39:33.066
Oh, God. Which way has she gone?

39:33.149 --> 39:35.443
Priscilla, where are you?

39:37.612 --> 39:38.655
Priscilla!

39:42.742 --> 39:43.827
Oh, God.

39:46.413 --> 39:50.041
Okay, back to the fucking car.

40:27.621 --> 40:29.080
Where is she?

40:29.914 --> 40:31.333
What have I done?

40:32.083 --> 40:33.835
Helen?

40:34.919 --> 40:36.379
Helen!

40:36.463 --> 40:39.007
I'm over here, for Christ's sakes!

40:42.177 --> 40:43.803
What are you doing?

40:43.887 --> 40:46.389
- You locked the car, you idiot.
- But you were the last one out.

40:46.473 --> 40:49.184
- You took the keys!
- There's a car.

40:50.226 --> 40:51.645
There's a car coming.

40:52.562 --> 40:55.148
Help! Please stop!

40:56.983 --> 40:58.151
Stop.

41:04.032 --> 41:07.952
Excuse me, sir. Can you help us, please?

41:15.877 --> 41:17.962
My friend is hurt.

41:21.424 --> 41:23.051
My friend...

41:23.134 --> 41:26.346
- Who the hell is this?
- He's going to help us.

41:26.429 --> 41:28.098
To an early grave.

41:30.392 --> 41:32.644
- He's wearing pajamas.
- I know.

41:32.727 --> 41:35.355
But at the moment he's the only option
we've got. Now, come on.

41:47.117 --> 41:48.410
Thank you so much for this.

41:53.873 --> 41:55.333
Where are we going?

41:55.417 --> 41:58.336
Um, perhaps we could get out now, please?

41:58.712 --> 42:02.382
Could you stop the car now, please?
We'd like to get out now, please.

42:23.862 --> 42:25.238
Charming.

42:30.869 --> 42:35.081
There is a hotel in the next town.
I will call you a taxi. Wait here.

42:35.165 --> 42:38.376
Voulez-vous attendez là.
Do you know who I am?

42:38.460 --> 42:42.505
I am a very famous actress
who's about to die from exposure,

42:42.589 --> 42:44.257
so get out of my way.

42:46.885 --> 42:47.969
We're together.

42:48.052 --> 42:49.679
Non, écoute-moi.

42:51.063 --> 42:52.223
J'appelle la police.

42:52.307 --> 42:54.225
- No, no, madame.
- What's she saying?

42:54.309 --> 42:57.854
- She's calling the police.
- No, don't you dare!

42:57.937 --> 42:59.689
- Allô?
- They're staying.

43:01.566 --> 43:05.487
- That's not possible.
- They're my guests.

43:05.570 --> 43:07.989
Show them to their rooms.

43:08.072 --> 43:12.410
Find them something to wear.
Then they will join me for dinner.

43:12.494 --> 43:14.954
- But, sir, you're very...
- Now, Sylvie.

43:17.749 --> 43:19.876
You have to change for dinner.

43:19.959 --> 43:22.462
- There are clothes in the wardrobes.
- Merci.

43:22.545 --> 43:24.798
Well, he's obviously loaded.

43:25.965 --> 43:28.843
- Do you think he's single?
- Shh.

43:28.927 --> 43:32.388
Is he your boss or your husband or what?

44:34.617 --> 44:36.035
Oh, my God.

44:37.829 --> 44:41.583
I'm so sorry. I'll go and change.

44:42.292 --> 44:46.588
Please don't.
It's lovely to see it worn again.

44:48.298 --> 44:49.966
That's your wife?

44:50.967 --> 44:52.176
Yes.

44:54.220 --> 44:57.181
- Are we ready?
- Let's eat.

45:04.564 --> 45:06.190
So you're rich?

45:07.609 --> 45:08.651
A little.

45:09.986 --> 45:11.529
And famous?

45:12.989 --> 45:14.324
Unfortunately.

45:15.617 --> 45:17.660
For what exactly?

45:22.457 --> 45:23.750
Wow.

45:26.461 --> 45:31.132
So now you're a recluse
locked away in this big old house

45:31.215 --> 45:32.925
with Nurse Ratched.

45:33.009 --> 45:34.802
How utterly miserable.

45:34.886 --> 45:38.848
Is that why you drive around at night
in your pajamas?

45:42.352 --> 45:44.896
Well, I know that fame can make you crazy.

45:45.605 --> 45:46.856
We're similar, you know,

45:46.939 --> 45:51.611
except that you have a lot of money
and are still famous.

45:56.199 --> 45:59.410
I do like a man with a good head of hair.

46:07.210 --> 46:10.421
So, is your wife dead or just gone shopping?

46:10.505 --> 46:11.714
Helen.

46:13.007 --> 46:14.050
Dead.

46:14.884 --> 46:19.013
Oh. Well, there's no point
in beating about the bush.

46:19.097 --> 46:20.890
I mean, at our time of life,

46:20.973 --> 46:24.227
I think we all need a little
companionship and a little love.

46:24.310 --> 46:26.479
Well, I know I do.

46:28.398 --> 46:30.650
I don't think you get much of that, do you?

46:31.693 --> 46:35.697
Although I'm not sure that love
is all that it's cracked up to be.

46:37.365 --> 46:39.992
Have you ever been in love?

46:41.285 --> 46:43.996
- Yes.
- Well, good for you.

46:44.956 --> 46:48.418
I don't think Priscilla has, have you?

46:50.753 --> 46:55.091
And you know, up until now, neither had I.

47:01.013 --> 47:03.391
Frenchmen are so romantic.

47:04.183 --> 47:07.687
- I'm Italian.
- Well, that's even better.

47:08.521 --> 47:11.107
Italians are the best lovers.

47:11.190 --> 47:13.025
Gosh, you almost gave me a heart attack.

47:13.109 --> 47:16.446
I'm so sorry. It's my hands.
I've... I've got arthritis.

47:16.529 --> 47:19.532
And I haven't got my tablets. Sorry.

47:21.367 --> 47:24.328
- You need a drink.
- No, I...

47:25.079 --> 47:28.207
It's been rather a long day.
I think I'll go to bed.

47:28.291 --> 47:30.668
- I will come with you.
- Oh.

47:30.752 --> 47:32.712
I've got just what you need.

47:32.795 --> 47:34.672
Easy, tiger.

47:36.090 --> 47:38.468
Have another drink. I won't be long.

47:38.551 --> 47:40.928
Hmm. Okay.

48:00.740 --> 48:01.949
Hello.

48:13.211 --> 48:14.587
I'm afraid I don't smoke.

48:20.927 --> 48:25.598
Neither do I.
But I make an exception for drugs.

48:26.224 --> 48:28.726
Medicinal purposes only, of course.

48:30.812 --> 48:33.564
It will help your hands, I promise.

49:24.740 --> 49:26.259
What's so funny?

49:27.243 --> 49:28.369
Priscilla!

49:31.205 --> 49:34.000
What's so funny? Are you laughing about me?

49:34.083 --> 49:35.668
No!

49:36.419 --> 49:37.837
Shh.

49:37.920 --> 49:41.173
Oh, in case she told you
that her husband's dead, he's not.

49:41.257 --> 49:43.551
He's very much alive!

49:46.304 --> 49:47.597
I'm sorry.

49:48.780 --> 49:50.558
He's a very lucky man.

49:52.435 --> 49:53.603
I suppose he is.

49:54.686 --> 49:56.747
What are you whispering about now?

51:09.011 --> 51:11.931
- Good morning.
- Hello.

51:15.726 --> 51:17.478
That looks inviting.

51:19.438 --> 51:22.191
I was preparing myself
psychologically to go in.

51:22.274 --> 51:24.819
- Oh.
- It takes me ages.

51:24.902 --> 51:26.779
I swim every day.

51:27.738 --> 51:29.907
- You do?
- Yes.

51:30.783 --> 51:32.344
Are you crazy?

51:33.486 --> 51:34.788
Probably.

51:36.205 --> 51:37.331
Well...

51:39.208 --> 51:40.960
you can help me to go in.

51:41.669 --> 51:45.006
- I'd love to, but I haven't got a costume.
- Neither have I.

51:49.468 --> 51:50.469
Oh!

51:52.263 --> 51:53.931
Come in as you are.

51:55.558 --> 51:59.311
Ready? One, two, three!

52:02.148 --> 52:03.607
Oh, my God.

52:04.817 --> 52:06.485
- It is a little bit chilly.
- It's lovely.

52:06.569 --> 52:08.654
- You should not be swimming.
- Beautiful!

52:08.738 --> 52:11.407
Some of us have a funeral to get to tomorrow.

52:11.490 --> 52:14.243
Unless you've forgotten
why we're here, Priscilla.

52:14.326 --> 52:15.536
Sorry.

52:15.619 --> 52:17.955
- You must get out.
- Okay.

52:19.039 --> 52:21.708
- Monsieur!
- Brrr!

52:21.959 --> 52:23.502
Hurry up, Priscilla.

52:39.226 --> 52:41.395
I'll sit in front.

53:49.839 --> 53:51.799
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

53:59.140 --> 54:00.641
Anyone fancy a little walk?

54:00.724 --> 54:02.393
- Yes.
- Great.

54:04.145 --> 54:07.273
Uh... actually, um, no.

54:07.356 --> 54:10.734
You go. I feel a bit tired.

54:10.818 --> 54:13.779
- Oh, really?
- You do look a bit tired.

54:13.863 --> 54:16.949
- Do I?
- For God's sakes, yes, you do.

54:17.032 --> 54:18.450
And you just said you did.

54:20.327 --> 54:21.328
Oh.

54:24.915 --> 54:25.958
Okay.

54:31.672 --> 54:32.965
Ciao.

54:34.216 --> 54:36.260
I feel ten years younger being here with you.

54:37.928 --> 54:40.848
All my aches and pains, they've gone away.

55:28.229 --> 55:31.440
- Please.
- Merci, Alberto.

55:33.150 --> 55:34.860
Thank you very much.

55:36.237 --> 55:39.615
Hello, hello. I'm stuck in the car.

55:39.698 --> 55:43.077
Would somebody like
to get me out of this car, please?

55:43.160 --> 55:44.620
Thank you so much.

55:45.496 --> 55:49.208
- God, this is a circus.
- I thought you'd enjoy it.

55:49.291 --> 55:51.293
You've no idea.

55:51.377 --> 55:53.420
Uh, pardonnez-moi.

55:53.504 --> 55:55.381
Excusez-moi.

55:55.464 --> 55:56.924
Don't mind me.

55:57.967 --> 56:00.686
Come on, Dad. Let's go. Let's go.

56:00.770 --> 56:02.054
Come on.

56:05.891 --> 56:07.437
Okay.

56:23.367 --> 56:25.995
- Stop. Don't.
- Why?

56:27.037 --> 56:28.664
Can I buy you dinner?

56:29.581 --> 56:33.252
- Yes, but...
- Just the two of us.

56:33.335 --> 56:36.714
- Isn't that a bit rude?
- No. Quick.

57:52.081 --> 57:54.750
- Beautiful.
- Lovely. It suits you.

57:54.833 --> 57:58.170
The same color of your blouse
and the same color of your eyes.

57:59.505 --> 58:03.217
- Shall I buy it?
- I will buy it for you.

58:03.967 --> 58:06.470
Beautiful. Wonderful.

58:17.606 --> 58:18.607
Wait here.

58:37.751 --> 58:39.211
Hello?

58:40.796 --> 58:41.797
Hello?

58:42.631 --> 58:43.924
Qui est vous?

58:45.426 --> 58:48.512
- Que voulez-vous?
- Oh.

58:48.595 --> 58:50.180
Nothing. I'm so sorry.

58:50.264 --> 58:53.809
Wait. Are you English? I can speak English.

58:53.892 --> 58:56.770
- I'm half English.
- Really?

58:56.854 --> 58:59.398
- What's your name?
- Eleanor. What's yours?

58:59.481 --> 59:02.609
- Es? What you doing?
- Out here, Mummy.

59:02.693 --> 59:04.862
Come inside, sweetheart. It's late.

59:04.945 --> 59:07.906
This lady's from England.
I was practicing my English.

59:07.990 --> 59:12.703
Hello. How kind.
Darling, we've got a big day tomorrow.

59:12.786 --> 59:15.330
Um, I'm sorry.
I hope she wasn't bothering you.

59:15.414 --> 59:19.209
- Oh, no. No, not... not at all.
- Do I know you?

59:21.462 --> 59:24.381
Well... No, I don't think so.

59:25.257 --> 59:30.721
Oh, my God. I do know you.
You're Helen Shelly, aren't you?

59:32.181 --> 59:35.726
Oh, my God. My dad would be so pleased.

59:36.310 --> 59:37.561
I doubt that.

59:37.644 --> 59:39.980
- Please, will you come inside a moment?
- No, no. I really....

59:40.063 --> 59:41.899
I just want to show you something, please.

59:41.982 --> 59:43.567
Oh, alright.

59:45.110 --> 59:47.237
What a beautiful, beautiful house.

59:47.321 --> 59:50.365
You haven't changed at all. It's amazing.

59:50.449 --> 59:52.451
- Well, thank you.
- This way.

59:52.534 --> 59:54.036
Thank you.

59:54.119 --> 59:56.747
Look what I found going through his archive.

59:59.458 --> 01:00:02.419
- Is that you?
- Yes, it is.

01:00:03.253 --> 01:00:05.964
- That was your first film, wasn't it?
- Yes.

01:00:06.048 --> 01:00:07.132
Dad's first big hit.

01:00:09.092 --> 01:00:13.597
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you. Um...

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.393
I really... I just got a bit overexcited
at seeing you here.

01:00:18.477 --> 01:00:22.147
It's alright. I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm being stupid.

01:00:22.231 --> 01:00:26.819
Not at all. Um...
It's been a very sad time for all of us.

01:00:27.694 --> 01:00:31.073
Gosh, do you think that I met you
when I was a little girl?

01:00:31.156 --> 01:00:35.702
I don't think so. I've got to go.

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:45.087
We're having drinks after the funeral,
so please come and join us.

01:00:52.094 --> 01:00:56.098
Was... was Jerry a good father?

01:00:56.181 --> 01:01:00.060
Yes. He was... He was the best.

01:01:01.562 --> 01:01:06.233
You know... you are the image of your father.

01:01:06.316 --> 01:01:09.528
I know. That's what everyone says.

01:01:12.906 --> 01:01:16.118
Did you ever think about
finding your real mother?

01:01:16.201 --> 01:01:20.581
No. Uh... We were very happy.
I didn't want to spoil that.

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:24.376
Of course.

01:01:26.336 --> 01:01:29.172
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:40.976
You did the right thing, you know.
Not looking for your mother.

01:01:44.713 --> 01:01:46.064
Drive.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.971
Beautiful.

01:02:23.727 --> 01:02:27.272
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

01:02:28.357 --> 01:02:29.358
So am I.

01:02:33.111 --> 01:02:36.114
I used to be much braver when I was a child.

01:02:37.115 --> 01:02:39.159
I came here for love.

01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:58.178
Anyway...

01:03:00.055 --> 01:03:01.390
Thank you.

01:03:03.308 --> 01:03:06.019
To you. My English rose.

01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:18.865
- I shouldn't be here.
- Hmm?

01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:22.911
- I'm too old for all this.
- You're never too old.

01:03:22.995 --> 01:03:27.040
- But I have a family and they need me.
- They will have you back soon.

01:03:30.293 --> 01:03:32.879
- Unless...
- Unless?

01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:37.009
- Stupid idea.
- What?

01:03:37.968 --> 01:03:40.679
- No, nothing.
- Tell me.

01:03:42.848 --> 01:03:45.142
Unless you stay with me.

01:03:47.561 --> 01:03:49.187
Stupid idea, I know.

01:03:50.731 --> 01:03:54.609
It wouldn't be that bad. Would it?

01:03:55.902 --> 01:03:58.572
Oh, Alberto, I...

01:04:00.907 --> 01:04:02.367
I'm so sorry.

01:04:04.661 --> 01:04:06.830
I... I have to go.

01:05:02.177 --> 01:05:03.345
Merci.

01:05:15.107 --> 01:05:17.150
I would like to sing a song, please.

01:05:17.984 --> 01:05:20.362
- Really?
- Yes.

01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:23.323
- Tu es d'accord?
- Oui, d'accord.

01:05:24.199 --> 01:05:28.078
- Okay, so what would you like to sing?
- You'll see.

01:05:28.954 --> 01:05:30.914
- Madame...
- Thank you.

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:36.545
Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:40.799
Um... Sorry to interrupt your evening.

01:05:40.882 --> 01:05:45.137
I'm Helen Shelly. Uh...

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:49.599
Well, some of you may have heard of me.

01:05:49.683 --> 01:05:52.269
Some of you may not. Um...

01:05:52.352 --> 01:05:59.151
I would like to sing a song
that was very famous a long time ago.

01:05:59.234 --> 01:06:00.777
Like me.

01:06:10.287 --> 01:06:15.792
<i># Who can I turn to #</i>

01:06:15.876 --> 01:06:19.838
<i># When nobody needs me? #</i>

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:23.425
<i># My heart wants to know #</i>

01:06:23.508 --> 01:06:25.510
<i># And still I may go #</i>

01:06:25.594 --> 01:06:30.140
<i># Where destiny leads me #</i>

01:06:30.849 --> 01:06:35.103
<i># With no star to guide me #</i>

01:06:35.187 --> 01:06:39.774
<i># And no one beside me #</i>

01:06:39.858 --> 01:06:41.651
<i># I'll go on my way #</i>

01:06:41.735 --> 01:06:44.696
<i># And after the day #</i>

01:06:44.779 --> 01:06:48.909
<i># The darkness will guide me #</i>

01:06:50.076 --> 01:06:54.039
<i># And maybe tomorrow #</i>

01:06:54.122 --> 01:06:57.459

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:59.252

01:07:20.315 --> 01:07:24.611
<i># If you turn away? #</i>

01:07:33.536 --> 01:07:36.831
Excuse me. I can't believe it's you.
I'm a huge fan.

01:07:36.915 --> 01:07:39.626
- Thanks.
- No, I have to have a picture with you.

01:07:40.502 --> 01:07:41.795
Smile.

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:46.174
You are still so sexy.

01:07:46.258 --> 01:07:50.262
- Sorry. I'm... I'm a bit drunk.
- Well, so am I.

01:07:52.806 --> 01:07:55.141
Well, won't you help me to my room?

01:07:55.225 --> 01:07:56.685
Of course.

01:07:56.768 --> 01:07:58.770
- This way.
- This way?

01:08:30.176 --> 01:08:32.178
It's not a stupid idea.

01:08:44.566 --> 01:08:46.109
You haven't told me what you're doing here.

01:08:46.192 --> 01:08:48.819
Oh... Making a movie.

01:08:49.738 --> 01:08:52.741
Really? I didn't know any filming
was going on here.

01:08:54.075 --> 01:08:57.370
- What is it?
- It's comedy.

01:08:58.203 --> 01:09:00.874
Well, you can do comedy.

01:09:00.957 --> 01:09:02.917
- You think so?
- Of course.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.301
Forty years too late. No offense.

01:09:13.094 --> 01:09:14.511
None taken.

01:09:18.767 --> 01:09:23.020
Um, well... nice to meet you
and good luck with your film.

01:09:23.104 --> 01:09:24.856
Likewise.

01:09:34.823 --> 01:09:40.037
- You have a lovely smile.
- I feel like a teenager again.

01:09:41.456 --> 01:09:42.832
That's good.

01:10:15.824 --> 01:10:18.368
Maybe I should go back to my room now.

01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:23.331
If you want.

01:10:40.515 --> 01:10:43.184
Would you mind turning the lights out?

01:11:41.701 --> 01:11:42.994
Alberto?

01:11:55.006 --> 01:11:56.466
Alberto?

01:12:11.981 --> 01:12:14.400
Alberto. Oh, my God.

01:12:19.072 --> 01:12:20.323
Please, God, no!

01:12:20.406 --> 01:12:24.160
- Housekeeping.
- No, no, no! Later.

01:12:24.244 --> 01:12:25.870
No, madame, thank you!

01:12:42.387 --> 01:12:43.471
Helen.

01:12:53.231 --> 01:12:56.609
- Helen?
- Go away.

01:12:56.693 --> 01:13:00.530
- Helen, it's me. I need you.
- I'm not going. I've changed my mind.

01:13:00.613 --> 01:13:01.906
Please. It's urgent.

01:13:02.865 --> 01:13:04.867
- What do you want?
- He's dead.

01:13:05.577 --> 01:13:07.870
- Who's dead?
- Shh. Alberto's dead.

01:13:08.554 --> 01:13:09.622
Come quickly.

01:13:09.706 --> 01:13:10.707
Oh, God.

01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:12.333
Come on.

01:13:17.422 --> 01:13:21.342
- Oh, my God. What have you done?
- Nothing.

01:13:21.426 --> 01:13:23.177
That's a pretty big nothing.

01:13:23.261 --> 01:13:26.514
We went to sleep last night
and I didn't hear anything

01:13:26.598 --> 01:13:29.601
and when I woke up, he was like this.
It's awful.

01:13:30.393 --> 01:13:32.395
- What are we going to do?
- We?

01:13:34.689 --> 01:13:37.984
- Well, at least he died happy.
- Oh, God.

01:13:38.776 --> 01:13:41.362
There but for the grace of God go I.

01:13:42.864 --> 01:13:43.865
We have to tell someone.

01:13:44.657 --> 01:13:49.787
No. No, it's half past ten.
The funeral's at 12.

01:13:49.871 --> 01:13:53.916
- We're okay.
- I don't care. This is more important.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.045
Will you pull yourself together?
Look, he's dead!

01:13:57.128 --> 01:13:59.672
- He wouldn't want us to make a fuss.
- I have to.

01:14:01.299 --> 01:14:02.967
I'm getting dressed.

01:14:12.727 --> 01:14:14.812
My God!

01:14:14.896 --> 01:14:18.232
It's Helen Shelly, actually.
He's just sleeping. Leave him alone.

01:14:18.316 --> 01:14:21.027
- He's dead?
- Don't exaggerate.

01:14:21.778 --> 01:14:24.238
Alberto Rosetti is dead!

01:14:24.322 --> 01:14:27.784
Hmm. Well, he had to go sometime.

01:14:27.867 --> 01:14:31.871
We all do, my dear, but not just yet.

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.872
Hello!

01:14:42.548 --> 01:14:44.842
Alberto Rosetti... he's dead!

01:14:44.926 --> 01:14:49.764
Excuse me, sir,
I am very sorry, but there's, um...

01:14:49.847 --> 01:14:52.684
There's a man...
There's a dead man in the room.

01:14:54.477 --> 01:14:58.231
- His name is Alberto Rosetti.
- Alberto Rosetti?

01:14:58.314 --> 01:15:00.942
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.
He must have had a heart attack.

01:15:01.025 --> 01:15:02.735
My God! Alberto Rosetti is dead?

01:15:02.819 --> 01:15:06.280
Yes. I know.
It... It... It's a terrible shock.

01:15:07.198 --> 01:15:09.117
Wait a moment, please.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.538
- Hello? Get me the police, please.
- Police?

01:15:13.621 --> 01:15:15.873
- Yes, madame.
- Is that necessary?

01:15:15.957 --> 01:15:18.459
- Absolutely.
- See what you've done?

01:15:18.543 --> 01:15:21.671
There's nothing we can do.
I have got to get to this funeral.

01:15:21.754 --> 01:15:23.589
This is not all about you and your career.

01:15:23.673 --> 01:15:27.135
- She killed Alberto...
- I didn't!

01:15:27.218 --> 01:15:29.762
And she stole his wallet!

01:15:29.846 --> 01:15:33.516
Mum! I don't believe it! We've found you!

01:15:33.599 --> 01:15:36.519
Christ! This is all we need.
Stand your ground.

01:15:36.602 --> 01:15:38.020
What a nice surprise.

01:15:38.104 --> 01:15:41.023
- You've led us on a merry dance.
- Where have you been, Mum?

01:15:41.107 --> 01:15:43.693
She's been on holiday with me.

01:15:43.776 --> 01:15:47.864
- Excuse me? Who are you?
- Her friend.

01:15:47.947 --> 01:15:52.744
This is Helen Shelly. Remember, Frank?
The film Morty & Me?

01:15:54.704 --> 01:15:56.581
<i># Me and Morty #</i>

01:15:56.664 --> 01:15:58.916
<i># Morty and... me #</i>

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.211
Mum, are you ill?

01:16:02.295 --> 01:16:05.798
- I'm really worried about you.
- Can we go home now?

01:16:05.882 --> 01:16:07.049
We're gonna go right now.

01:16:07.133 --> 01:16:08.801
- Right now?
- Mum, let's go.

01:16:08.885 --> 01:16:10.094
I need the lavatory first.

01:16:10.178 --> 01:16:14.390
Right. Fine. Mum, get in the car,
please. We'll be out in a minute.

01:16:14.474 --> 01:16:16.392
Come on. Get out of here right now!

01:16:16.476 --> 01:16:18.561
You need to wait for the police!

01:16:18.644 --> 01:16:21.272
- The toilet, please?
- To the right, madame.

01:16:21.355 --> 01:16:22.799
Merci.

01:16:23.483 --> 01:16:25.985
Quick. We've gotta get out of here.
I've got the car keys.

01:16:26.068 --> 01:16:28.863
- What?
- Listen, I have to get to this funeral.

01:16:28.946 --> 01:16:32.992
- And I cannot go without you.
- But I can't leave, Helen.

01:16:33.075 --> 01:16:36.412
Surely you don't want to have
to explain all of this to Frank. Look.

01:16:36.496 --> 01:16:40.792
Listen to me, Prissy. I am begging you.
You promised me that you'd help.

01:16:40.875 --> 01:16:44.295
I have to tell them what happened to Alberto.

01:16:44.378 --> 01:16:45.546
You did not kill Alberto.

01:16:45.630 --> 01:16:48.174
He was a sick old man and he died very happy.

01:16:48.257 --> 01:16:50.343
Now, Frank is not gonna go away.

01:16:50.426 --> 01:16:52.470
You can explain everything
next time you see him,

01:16:52.553 --> 01:16:55.765
but right now I need you
to get in this car and drive!

01:17:02.922 --> 01:17:04.315
Go on.

01:17:19.497 --> 01:17:21.499
I think I was falling in love with him.

01:17:23.793 --> 01:17:25.628
He'd asked me to come and live with him.

01:17:27.129 --> 01:17:28.840
That would have gone down well.

01:17:57.535 --> 01:17:58.953
Come on.

01:18:23.019 --> 01:18:24.228
Harry?

01:18:25.396 --> 01:18:26.647
Harry.

01:18:28.649 --> 01:18:31.193
Harry Schneider, are you deaf?

01:18:32.904 --> 01:18:35.239
Yes? Do we know each other?

01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:37.658
I'll forget you said that.

01:18:37.742 --> 01:18:40.953
I'm so sorry. I have no idea who you are.

01:18:41.037 --> 01:18:41.996
Are you senile?

01:18:43.164 --> 01:18:45.666
- I don't think so.
- She's Helen Shelly.

01:18:47.835 --> 01:18:51.589
Helen. My God.

01:18:51.672 --> 01:18:55.468
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I need a job, Harry.

01:18:55.551 --> 01:18:57.011
You owe me.

01:18:58.012 --> 01:19:01.140
Of course. Come round to the hotel after.

01:19:01.807 --> 01:19:04.310
- Then I'll see what I can do for you.
- Yeah.

01:19:04.393 --> 01:19:06.437
- You'll set that up, right?
- Sure.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.648
- What hotel?
- La Baronnie.

01:19:09.148 --> 01:19:12.985
- Off the main square.
- Okay. Thanks.

01:19:35.591 --> 01:19:36.634
Welcome.

01:19:36.717 --> 01:19:38.803
Uh...

01:19:38.886 --> 01:19:44.266
It's lovely to see you all here.
I had planned to read a poem.

01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:47.812
Well, Dad had planned for me to read it.

01:19:47.895 --> 01:19:53.234
But this morning somehow
it just didn't feel right.

01:19:53.317 --> 01:19:59.365
So, um, I'm going a bit off-piste
I'm afraid. Sorry, Dad.

01:20:00.491 --> 01:20:01.659
Uh...

01:20:04.245 --> 01:20:09.258
Growing up with a famous director
was an adventure.

01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:13.796
We all know that he could be
a bit of a control freak.

01:20:15.339 --> 01:20:20.469
But we also know how funny
and how loving he was.

01:20:21.012 --> 01:20:22.346
How loyal.

01:20:25.266 --> 01:20:29.353
The most important thing to Dad
was the story.

01:20:29.854 --> 01:20:33.774
How to tell a story
that people would believe in

01:20:33.858 --> 01:20:36.152
and would identify with.

01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:44.076
Him leaving us has, um...

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.830
prompted me to reflect on my own story

01:20:47.913 --> 01:20:50.791
and how it could have been so different.

01:20:51.459 --> 01:20:53.878
But Dad took hold of it

01:20:53.961 --> 01:20:57.882
and he made it something
that I could believe in.

01:20:57.965 --> 01:21:01.302
Into a very happy story.

01:21:01.385 --> 01:21:04.013
And for that I am so grateful.

01:21:05.598 --> 01:21:07.475
So I just want to say...

01:21:08.601 --> 01:21:10.436
thank you, Dad.

01:21:11.228 --> 01:21:14.440
Thank you for giving me a happy story.

01:21:14.523 --> 01:21:19.153
And, um, well, uh... that's it.

01:21:21.197 --> 01:21:23.324
Love you, Dad.

01:21:49.433 --> 01:21:50.976
Lucy...

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.062
I'm here for you.

01:21:55.397 --> 01:21:56.524
I'm your mother.

01:21:58.818 --> 01:22:00.778
Excuse me, madame, but you must leave.

01:22:00.861 --> 01:22:03.614
- No.
- Yes, you must.

01:22:06.575 --> 01:22:09.829
I would like you to leave, please.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.374
I've come all this way just to see you.

01:22:14.166 --> 01:22:17.169
I just want to be here with you and Eleanor.

01:22:17.962 --> 01:22:19.505
If you'll let me.

01:22:20.506 --> 01:22:22.591
You're not my mother.

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.427
Helen.

01:22:26.178 --> 01:22:27.805
She wants you to go. Come on.

01:22:27.888 --> 01:22:29.223
I am.

01:22:30.641 --> 01:22:32.309
How dare you?

01:22:33.227 --> 01:22:34.520
Go.

01:22:36.647 --> 01:22:38.899
Please leave.

01:22:43.863 --> 01:22:46.323
- I am.
- Shh!

01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:52.246
- Cette dame-là.
- Madame! Madame!

01:22:52.329 --> 01:22:54.415
- We need you to come to police station.
- Why?

01:22:54.498 --> 01:22:57.459
Were you with Alberto Rosetti
in his room hotel last night?

01:22:58.335 --> 01:22:59.879
Mum, what have you done?

01:23:01.213 --> 01:23:04.049
No. Don't be ridiculous. It was me.

01:23:05.551 --> 01:23:07.469
Since when was sleeping with a man a crime?

01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:10.639
Since he died. Come with us, please.

01:23:12.808 --> 01:23:15.603
Don't worry! We'll find you!
Come on. Let's get in the car.

01:23:28.199 --> 01:23:31.702
- So it was you who was with Alberto?
- Yes.

01:23:31.785 --> 01:23:33.537
And you had been with him all night?

01:23:34.788 --> 01:23:37.166
- And he was fine when you went to bed?
- Yes.

01:23:38.876 --> 01:23:44.715
But when you woke up in the morning
he was on the floor, dead?

01:23:44.798 --> 01:23:45.925
Yes.

01:23:47.927 --> 01:23:49.803
That must have been a nasty shock.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.558
Okay. That is all for now.

01:23:55.726 --> 01:23:56.977
Thank you.

01:23:58.854 --> 01:23:59.897
Merci.

01:24:01.357 --> 01:24:04.485
I had nothing to do with this.
You've got to let me go!

01:24:04.568 --> 01:24:07.154
I have a very, very important meeting
to get to.

01:24:07.238 --> 01:24:08.447
Wait here, please.

01:24:08.989 --> 01:24:12.868
- I've got to get a message to Harry.
- I can't believe you lied to me.

01:24:12.952 --> 01:24:14.662
Oh, yeah, well, okay. Get over it.

01:24:14.745 --> 01:24:19.083
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, please, give me a break.

01:24:19.166 --> 01:24:22.503
But you might have had a chance if you
hadn't gate-crashed her father's funeral.

01:24:23.254 --> 01:24:26.423
I didn't plan on standing up there,

01:24:26.507 --> 01:24:30.427
but, unlike you,
I was actually moved to do something.

01:24:30.511 --> 01:24:32.888
If she doesn't want to know, I get that.

01:24:32.972 --> 01:24:36.475
I can see that she's better off
without me, but at least I tried.

01:24:37.393 --> 01:24:41.188
- What do you mean?
- Oh. "I think I love him."

01:24:41.272 --> 01:24:44.066
"He's asked me to live with him."

01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:48.404
Really pathetic!
I've never heard anything so deluded.

01:24:48.487 --> 01:24:52.449
Thank God the old man snuffed it before
you made even more of a fool of yourself.

01:24:52.533 --> 01:24:54.034
Stop it, please!

01:24:54.118 --> 01:24:56.578
I'm just telling you the truth,
but you can't take it.

01:24:56.662 --> 01:25:01.041
The truth is that you are
a deeply unpleasant and selfish woman

01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:03.836
who cares for nobody except herself.

01:25:05.045 --> 01:25:07.631
Oh, God, if only I had another chance
with George.

01:25:07.715 --> 01:25:11.302
You had yours with your child
and you blew it.

01:25:15.431 --> 01:25:17.891
Fine friend you turned out to be.

01:25:19.768 --> 01:25:21.186
I'm not your friend.

01:25:28.068 --> 01:25:30.696
- What the hell is going on, Mum?
- Where is Madame Shelly?

01:25:31.739 --> 01:25:35.034
- Dans la toilette.
- Okay. Well, you can both go.

01:25:35.743 --> 01:25:37.202
- Really?
- Yes.

01:25:37.286 --> 01:25:39.747
He had a heart attack as you thought.

01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:43.584
His assistant called me. He was very ill.

01:25:43.667 --> 01:25:45.919
I think you made him happy.

01:25:47.004 --> 01:25:51.050
He was a great man.
You will tell your friend.

01:25:52.134 --> 01:25:53.469
Yes.

01:25:53.552 --> 01:25:55.387
Good luck.

01:26:36.845 --> 01:26:38.305
Hello.

01:26:38.389 --> 01:26:41.016
Is Harry Schneider here?

01:26:42.434 --> 01:26:43.519
He's checked out.

01:26:46.438 --> 01:26:49.024
Oh. Thank you.

01:26:51.819 --> 01:26:54.446
Hey, you. Where's Harry?

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:56.156
He had to leave on urgent business.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.411
- Don't lie to me.
- We're sorry not to be able to meet up.

01:27:00.494 --> 01:27:03.831
Here's our card. He said to make sure
you come visit in LA.

01:27:03.914 --> 01:27:06.750
Come by. Have a cup of tea. He's a big fan.

01:27:17.094 --> 01:27:18.887
Why did you come here?

01:27:21.432 --> 01:27:25.310
- To meet you.
- Not to get a job?

01:27:32.317 --> 01:27:34.903
I wanted to see if you were okay.

01:27:35.612 --> 01:27:37.448
And you are. You're...

01:27:38.365 --> 01:27:40.200
You're wonderful.

01:27:40.284 --> 01:27:43.245
You did so much better without me.

01:27:45.247 --> 01:27:47.916
I knew that Jerry would look after you.

01:27:49.126 --> 01:27:51.295
But I just want you to know that...

01:27:52.254 --> 01:27:57.718
Well, there hasn't been a single day
that I haven't thought about you.

01:27:59.261 --> 01:28:03.557
And I... I just wanna say I'm sorry.

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:05.767
I'm sorry.

01:29:52.207 --> 01:29:54.084
I don't feel well.

01:29:58.046 --> 01:30:01.758
- Do you need a doctor?
- No.

01:30:02.843 --> 01:30:06.847
I need to go home with my wife.

01:30:08.515 --> 01:30:12.686
Frank, I'm...
I'm sorry I've caused all this fuss.

01:30:13.854 --> 01:30:14.938
We'll be home soon.

01:30:19.151 --> 01:30:21.403
What's wrong with you, then?

01:30:25.365 --> 01:30:27.159
Oh, get off. You're squashing me.

01:30:31.705 --> 01:30:34.166
Why did you have to make
such a spectacle of yourself

01:30:34.249 --> 01:30:35.751
jumping into the sea?

01:30:35.834 --> 01:30:38.670
- Could have killed yourself.
- I had to.

01:30:41.965 --> 01:30:45.177
It doesn't bring George back,
though, does it?

01:30:46.553 --> 01:30:48.764
- No, but...
- But nothing.

01:30:53.185 --> 01:30:55.270
Pass me my shoes.

01:30:57.064 --> 01:30:58.565
My shoes.

01:31:07.115 --> 01:31:10.535
- Where are you going now?
- I'll see you downstairs.

01:31:42.359 --> 01:31:43.693
What's this?

01:31:49.533 --> 01:31:51.076
Yes, talk to the writer.

01:31:51.159 --> 01:31:54.871
We've gotta sit him down with the writer,
otherwise it's not gonna work out.

01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:59.126
- No.
- Mr. Schneider?

01:31:59.209 --> 01:32:02.170
Mr. Schneider,
I'm sorry to bother you like this...

01:32:02.254 --> 01:32:06.007
Hold on a moment. Yes. Hello. Do I know you?

01:32:06.091 --> 01:32:07.300
Who's she talking to?

01:32:07.384 --> 01:32:10.887
I'm a friend of Helen Shelly. Did she
manage to make contact with you?

01:32:10.971 --> 01:32:13.306
Thank God, no.

01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:16.560
Frankly, I hope she does us all a big favor

01:32:16.643 --> 01:32:19.187
and disappears back
where she came from. Drive.

01:32:25.444 --> 01:32:27.737
- Sooner we get you home, the better.
- Mum!

01:32:29.281 --> 01:32:33.326
- What are you doing? Get back in.
- I need to find my friend.

01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:36.246
- Don't be ridiculous. Get back in.
- Frank...

01:32:36.329 --> 01:32:38.457
There's something I want to say to you.

01:32:39.583 --> 01:32:43.211
I'm sorry George died when he was with me.

01:32:44.004 --> 01:32:46.089
But it wasn't my fault.

01:32:47.549 --> 01:32:51.178
And I don't want to try and bring him
back. I know that's not possible.

01:32:51.261 --> 01:32:55.724
I just want to remember him
for the beautiful boy that he was.

01:32:56.933 --> 01:33:01.313
And over these past few days,
I've realized how...

01:33:02.189 --> 01:33:04.524
how miserable my life has been.

01:33:05.984 --> 01:33:08.195
And I want to enjoy the rest of it.

01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:12.824
So I intend to do that. Starting right now.

01:33:13.867 --> 01:33:15.118
No, no. Stay there, sweetheart.

01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:22.000
I'm fine.

01:33:23.919 --> 01:33:27.422
I love you very much
and you'll always be my best girl.

01:33:29.841 --> 01:33:31.593
- It'll be alright.
- Yes.

01:33:31.676 --> 01:33:32.844
Wait.

01:33:37.974 --> 01:33:39.768
Oh, Frank.

01:33:41.937 --> 01:33:43.563
Thank you.

01:33:47.275 --> 01:33:49.653
I'm sorry.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:55.534
Will you come home now?

01:33:56.451 --> 01:33:57.827
No.

01:34:56.428 --> 01:35:00.473
Excuse me. I'm looking for Madame Shelly.

01:35:00.557 --> 01:35:02.642
- She's a big star.
- I don't know her. Sorry.

01:35:02.726 --> 01:35:04.185
Is that the bar?

01:35:04.269 --> 01:35:07.272
Yes, the bar's over there.
Maybe she's in there.

01:35:31.171 --> 01:35:32.297
Helen?

01:35:57.113 --> 01:35:59.074
Please, sir... Where is the beach?

01:35:59.157 --> 01:36:01.826
- It is over there, madame.
- Thank you.

01:37:23.616 --> 01:37:24.784
Helen...

01:37:33.668 --> 01:37:37.338
I saw her again at the hotel.

01:37:40.592 --> 01:37:43.344
I said I was sorry, but she...

01:37:44.971 --> 01:37:48.016
She didn't want... She didn't wanna know.

01:37:50.727 --> 01:37:53.646
I just wanted to see her again before...

01:37:56.107 --> 01:37:57.776
before it's too late.

01:38:04.073 --> 01:38:05.533
I've left Frank.

01:38:26.805 --> 01:38:28.389
What now?

01:38:28.473 --> 01:38:31.851
Well, I don't know about you,
but I fancy a little drive.

01:38:33.144 --> 01:38:35.188
- Come on, my friend.
- Yes.

01:38:40.527 --> 01:38:42.862
