00:01.377 --> 00:03.671
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.718
Call the Director.
We struck out again.

00:08.884 --> 00:11.554
They won't give up on you,
especially Coulson.

00:11.721 --> 00:13.222
It's not just the Watchdogs now.

00:13.389 --> 00:15.558
<i>Local gangs have been working
for them.</i>

00:15.850 --> 00:17.601
<i>I was tracing the sale of a weapon.</i>

00:17.768 --> 00:19.270
A breath of fresh air.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.191
And I think I may have stumbled upon
a serial killer.

00:31.449 --> 00:32.783
Everyone's attached to something.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.411
You actually trust this guy?

00:35.578 --> 00:38.330
I don't trust the new director
but he trusts me.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.209
The Director will wanna have words
with you at HQ.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.628
It's been a long time
since we had a moment alone.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.799
- You okay?
- Just a long day.

01:34.178 --> 01:35.763
Dad! Dad!

01:40.059 --> 01:43.521
Hey, Buddy, what are you doing up?

01:43.729 --> 01:45.022
There was a ghost in there.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.734
There was?
Friendly or not friendly?

01:49.110 --> 01:50.694
- Not friendly.
- Yeah?

01:52.113 --> 01:56.867
- Well, it seems like he's gone now.
- She. It was a girl.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.871
Okay. Still, bed.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.169
Dad, don't...

02:16.554 --> 02:18.597
What are you doing in my house?

02:18.848 --> 02:20.516
Oh, my God!
Who the hell are you?

02:20.724 --> 02:21.851
Joseph!

02:22.184 --> 02:24.645
- Joe, come here! Hurry!
- There's no Joe.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.106
We lived here for years.
This is our house.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.865
Dad, I'm scared.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.076
No. No. No!

03:30.544 --> 03:31.629
Jefe, no way, no.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.797
The ball touched the ground.
You could see it.

03:33.964 --> 03:37.134
No, no, no.
Listen, Robbie will settle this.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.511
Hey, Reyes,
did you see the game last night?

03:39.678 --> 03:42.598
- Oh, missed it. I was out.
- Out?

03:43.307 --> 03:45.059
Oh, I know your code, man.

03:45.226 --> 03:48.062
- Oh, you do, huh?
- Sure. I was young once.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.315
Did you at least get her name?

03:51.482 --> 03:53.025
No, it wasn't like that.

03:53.192 --> 03:56.111
Man. We wait this long for a team to come
into town, and you don't even watch.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.240
If it ain't silver and black,
I don't really give a damn.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.617
<i>Ã“rale, mire</i>... Silver and black.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.996
As we have discussed,
it appears to be a simple empty box.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.831
Yes, one lined with a rare alloy,

04:07.998 --> 04:10.125
and emitting energy readings off
the charts

04:10.292 --> 04:12.461
that drove six men insane,
but, yeah.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.421
Simple empty box.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.257
Right. Well...

04:17.007 --> 04:18.676
You joked about how it would be less
of a puzzle

04:18.759 --> 04:19.843
if Schrodinger's cat were in there.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.012
- Hilarious.
- Thanks very much.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.806
But did get me thinking.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.850
What if there is something in there
in an unobservable quantum state?

04:27.017 --> 04:29.687
- Out of phase with visible light?
- Exactly.

04:29.853 --> 04:33.691
So, by using light outside
of the visible spectrum

04:34.191 --> 04:36.277
and reversing the phase,
we get this.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.237
Cue Jemma gasping.

04:39.905 --> 04:44.410
- Oh, my Lord. It's beautiful.
- It's indescribable.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.204
Scientifically. I've never seen
technology like this.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.999
Feel like a Dark Ages blacksmith
looking at a Tesla.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.918
Alien? Crystal-like structure
wrapping on itself,

04:53.085 --> 04:55.629
or a containment field, maybe,
but containing what?

04:55.796 --> 04:56.922
I think I know.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.050
A family turned up
at the local ER this morning.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.720
And the father, well,
he had the same signs of dementia

05:02.886 --> 05:03.929
as our gangster friends over there.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.514
- Near Los Angeles?
- Yeah.

05:05.681 --> 05:09.893
Now, he said that there was a ghost
in the house and it walked through him.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.146
So he's suffering
from the hallucinations, as well.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.689
Well, that's what I thought.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.567
But as I started going through
the footage...

05:20.195 --> 05:21.196
There.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.700
Maybe he wasn't hallucinating.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.621
We've been waiting an hour.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.291
I can read a clock, too.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.419
His assistant said
he's held up in a meeting.

05:36.587 --> 05:37.588
Look at this.

05:39.048 --> 05:41.258
Maybe they're discussing new ways
to implement bureaucracy.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.927
He's making you wait
just to remind you he can.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.056
He's pissed. We went after Daisy
without clearing it.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.724
I've been in his shoes before.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.476
Doesn't mean he'll go easy on you.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.227
I don't need him to go easy.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.772
I'll own what I did,
make my apologies,

05:54.938 --> 05:56.940
then head out
on our next deployment.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.612
- You're going right back out?
- Not a moment too soon.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.114
All this, the meetings,
the waiting...

06:04.948 --> 06:06.742
I do not miss that part of the job.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.038
It'd still be your job
if you put up half a fight.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.129
This room does it seem...?

06:19.296 --> 06:21.840
Like it was decorated by someone
who needs to unclench?

06:24.009 --> 06:26.512
Yeah, the Zephyr's feeling more
and more like home.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.057
In-flight meals could be better
but it's mine.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.393
At least, they can't take that away.

06:34.686 --> 06:38.273
Okay, Mrs Serrano. Just sign here.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.987
Thanks. Just take this
into the office.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.572
- You can pay inside.
- Okay.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.548
<i>Oh, my God.
I never even thought of that.</i>

07:02.714 --> 07:06.385
You must find so much weird stuff
in people's cars.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.680
Now I'm racking my brain,
wondering what I've left in mine.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.059
Oh, hey, Robbie.
So, this girl is telling me...

07:14.226 --> 07:17.312
Robbie Reyes. Wow.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.982
You look so different from the last time
I laid eyes on you.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.404
- Long-time no see.
- Yeah, it's been a minute.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.738
I was just telling Canelo here

07:26.905 --> 07:29.491
how tight we used to be back
at Garfield High.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.368
The stories I could tell...

07:32.369 --> 07:34.329
- What are you doing here?
- I'm having trouble with my van.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.833
Yesterday, out of nowhere,
it just burst into flames.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.169
And I hear you're sort of an expert
at that kind of thing,

07:40.252 --> 07:43.380
so I figured it was time
for us to reconnect.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.890
I don't know. Looks fine to me.

07:53.891 --> 07:57.519
The engine caught fire.
How is that not a dangerous problem?

07:57.936 --> 08:00.647
Maybe you should leave it alone.
So you don't get hurt.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.234
Or smoked.

08:11.950 --> 08:15.370
You claim your victims earn that.
Hard to verify all of them.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.500
- Somehow, you tracked me down.
- Just to talk.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.418
I figured you're either
on the right side of things or...

08:21.585 --> 08:24.046
Or what? Or else?

08:26.381 --> 08:27.883
You're out of your mind coming here.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.762
You may know who I am, but you don't
know me, or what I'm capable of.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.304
It's funny you should mention that.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.265
I was just thinking
of how many memories

08:35.432 --> 08:36.767
I have of you, Reyes.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.020
Not this "too cool for school" version
you've got going on now,

08:40.187 --> 08:42.188
but... the real you.

08:43.106 --> 08:46.944
He wasn't always
the strong silent type?

08:47.110 --> 08:50.614
Well, I've known him
since Crandall Elementary.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.409
He was always quiet,
like he was hiding something.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.663
The two of us used to hit up
the Moonraker Arcade

08:57.829 --> 09:00.207
down in Little Tokyo.
Isn't that right, Robbie?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.546
Yes, it is, so I've seen a side
of him that most people haven't.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.924
We used to hang there every day
until your uncle would pick you up.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.134
How's he doing these days?

09:14.096 --> 09:17.516
You get lost or I'll get angry.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.436
So angry, I may not remember
what I do to you.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.774
- Sometimes, I prefer it that way.
- In front of them?

09:29.820 --> 09:32.197
It's just a hose loose.
You're all good.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.957
Oh, no. Look at that.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.294
Looks like we'll be here
for a little bit longer.

09:48.839 --> 09:52.593
- Only two hours late.
- Let's just get this over with.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.141
Move.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.313
He doesn't appear to be moving.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.024
Director, they're here.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.234
- Send them in.
- Yes, sir.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.240
It's good. I just think
that should be the headline

10:15.407 --> 10:16.408
if that's the sidebar.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.951
Right, would you take a note
of that?

10:19.870 --> 10:20.996
Phillip!

10:22.456 --> 10:25.167
- Jeffrey.
- Agent May.

10:25.334 --> 10:28.253
Thanks for waiting.
Seems like this job requires you

10:28.420 --> 10:30.172
to be an hour behind
like all the time.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.382
- Or two.
- But you already know that.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.093
Right, Phil? Glad you're here.
Let's get down to business.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.054
Guys, can we have the room
for a minute, please?

10:37.512 --> 10:41.099
- Cecilio, go get yourself a coffee.
- Yes, sir.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.352
Look, I get you're disappointed,

10:43.518 --> 10:46.146
there was a mission to find Agent Johnson
without your authorisation,

10:46.313 --> 10:49.024
- but we had intel that suggested...
- Phil, it's okay.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.944
She was your friend.
Loyalty's a good thing.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.614
But I had a whole speech ready.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.908
Sure, it's good.
Use it next time.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.285
But today, you impressed me.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.496
You're impressed? Really?

11:02.663 --> 11:06.500
Yeah. I try to live by a simple rule,

11:06.833 --> 11:09.961
a team that trusts
is a team that triumphs.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.299
Right? I mean, you get that.
You get how I think.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.719
Then why do I still feel like
there's a "but" coming?

11:17.886 --> 11:20.347
And trust is important, especially
now.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.517
Ah. Not a "but," an "and."

11:24.142 --> 11:26.603
And Daisy's a problem
because you need the public's trust,

11:26.770 --> 11:28.438
given that you're about
to unveil S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.273
as a legitimate agency again.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.442
We're preparing
for an official announcement, yes.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.986
So it's kind of a bad time
for a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent

11:35.153 --> 11:37.447
- to be robbing banks.
- She would never get in the way.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.950
Hey, I'm only talking PR here.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.868
And I'm sure you don't like hearing
about optics,

11:42.035 --> 11:44.079
especially since Agent Johnson
was your friend.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.789
- "Optics?"
- You know, the way things look,

11:45.956 --> 11:47.040
the package we present.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.710
I know what it means.
It just seems trivial.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.795
Try to understand
that this is a very delicate stage.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.922
Public opinion matters a great deal.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.758
Without it, everything falls apart.

11:57.509 --> 12:01.388
And I don't want your friend responsible
for destroying everything

12:01.555 --> 12:04.474
that you have worked so hard
to rebuild here.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.976
It won't come to that.

12:09.187 --> 12:12.107
There's an issue I'd like to discuss
with Agent Coulson alone.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.275
Could you give us a minute?

12:15.986 --> 12:17.070
And Agent May.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.323
I can tell you're the one
to keep an eye on.

12:25.829 --> 12:26.997
Melinda May.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.499
Now, there's a riddle
I'd like to solve.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.792
Good luck with that.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.256
Phil, I got a special assignment
for you.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.050
Wait, wait, wait.
So, this woman

12:39.342 --> 12:43.096
caused a disturbance in Chen
and his people with a touch?

12:43.930 --> 12:46.057
Yeah, it seems there's something
to do with physical contact,

12:46.224 --> 12:47.893
but how is she incorporeal?

12:48.059 --> 12:49.936
Maybe a multidimensional
event caused it.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.563
- Like Tobias Ford.
- Yeah?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.858
Or perhaps
a matter-energy phase shift.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.902
You know, if the box
is utilising phase shifting...

12:57.068 --> 12:59.279
Maybe she's just a ghost.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.115
That's also a theory.

13:02.365 --> 13:05.035
Look, the alloy
in the box itself is very rare.

13:05.202 --> 13:08.246
It's only made at Momentum Labs
in three locations around the world.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.582
Or was. All three
have been shut down for years.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.584
Yeah, so you've got New York,
Pasadena...

13:12.751 --> 13:14.711
Pasadena, California.
Hold on.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.342
Yeah, the family
that checked in to the ER?

13:21.176 --> 13:23.845
They live in Pasadena.
I'll requisition a Quinjet for us.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.058
Yeah, I'll come, too.
Simmons can't.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.143
I'm stuck.
Assignment for the Director.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.187
- Seriously?
- Oh, you know,

13:32.354 --> 13:34.856
"A team that trusts
is a team that triumphs."

13:35.774 --> 13:38.235
- What's he got you doing?
- Oh, well, that's the best bit.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.904
"My expertise is needed here
for a tour."

13:42.656 --> 13:44.574
- A what?
- It'll be fun.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.701
It's not my job anymore, Jeffrey.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.995
And wouldn't my time be better
spent in the field instead of...

13:49.162 --> 13:51.248
Instead of walking some overly
pampered US Congress people

13:51.414 --> 13:53.458
around your private base? Maybe.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.793
You love this stuff.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.838
History, SSR trivia
that's where you shine.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.548
You're just complimenting me
so I'll do this.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.884
I'm complimenting you
because it's true.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.304
Look, you're the expert
on all things S.H.I.E.L.D., not me.

14:06.972 --> 14:10.642
And we both know
why I have this job.

14:12.227 --> 14:15.105
But what I don't have
is the anonymous, unlimited funding

14:15.272 --> 14:16.565
you seemed to have before.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.317
To build billion-dollar airplanes?

14:19.985 --> 14:23.613
No. Our budget hinges on the UN
and the Sokovia Accords

14:23.780 --> 14:26.283
and on impressing
the House Appropriations Committee.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.621
I can't do that myself. Please.

15:31.389 --> 15:32.432
Hugo.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.519
What happened?

15:37.395 --> 15:41.024
God, Lucy, look at you.
What did he do?

15:45.445 --> 15:48.156
- Hugo...
- What?

15:57.374 --> 15:58.541
Oh, my God.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.380
No.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.343
- Where are the others?
- Trapped in these cells, like us.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.804
Now, I know this is confusing,
but I need you to focus.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.180
Focus?

16:12.681 --> 16:16.184
Look at us.
What did he do to us?

16:17.060 --> 16:19.729
He has to pay.
We have to find him.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.481
We could've been in there for hours.

16:21.940 --> 16:25.777
Hugo, we have been in there
for years.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.077
What do you want?

16:37.580 --> 16:40.583
I looked into your kills.
Some of them check out.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.628
- I told you. It's vengeance.
- Vengeance. Right.

16:43.795 --> 16:47.132
Well, "vengeance" seems to put you
on the same track as me.

16:47.298 --> 16:50.051
- So, tell me what you know.
- Look, Detective,

16:50.343 --> 16:52.512
they got what they deserved.
End of story.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.681
All right.
Now I'll tell you what I know.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.142
There's a group
called the Watchdogs.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.393
They're hunting people like us.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.146
- "Us"?
- Inhumans.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.440
That's not what I am.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.858
Look, I know
what you're going through.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.818
I've been there and I know
that it's hard to understand,

17:06.901 --> 17:08.611
- but killing people is not...
- You're here to counsel me?

17:09.362 --> 17:10.946
You want to save my soul?

17:12.449 --> 17:17.287
- I'm telling you, girl, I sold mine.
- To the devil?

17:18.621 --> 17:20.999
He was the only one buying,
you know?

17:23.292 --> 17:24.461
Look, I'm done talking.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.630
You want to throw down again,
we could do that.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.257
I like my chances.

17:29.966 --> 17:34.596
You want to turn me in? Try it.
I've got nothing to lose.

17:35.305 --> 17:40.643
You may not, but Gabe might be
a little sad to lose his big brother.

17:41.770 --> 17:42.979
You're all he's got.

17:44.689 --> 17:47.609
Robbie!
Listen, I got to take the truck,

17:48.151 --> 17:50.945
drop off a GTO in Palm Desert.

17:51.488 --> 17:55.283
Take all the time you need.
I'll lock up.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.168
Now, you?

18:06.377 --> 18:08.046
You shouldn't have mentioned
my brother.

18:14.552 --> 18:18.348
- Doesn't have to go this way.
- You're wrong.

18:47.502 --> 18:51.047
Piper, get the squad ready.
Training in ten.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.715
- Yes, ma'am.
- "Ma'am?"

18:52.882 --> 18:55.176
Is there a different title
you'd prefer?

18:55.343 --> 18:58.179
- Commander? Sir?
- Let's just stick to "May."

18:58.346 --> 18:59.889
I can do "May."

19:01.766 --> 19:03.268
I can do that, May.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.774
...and the vaults contain
so much S.H.I.E.L.D. history that

19:10.066 --> 19:12.360
Agent Carter herself
didn't know it all.

19:13.736 --> 19:16.489
Oh, but this guy?
This guy's our real expert.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.408
He actually does know it all.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.077
I know some SSR history.
It's not a big deal.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.663
No. No, no, no.
He's being modest.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.832
Not only does he keep
this place running,

19:25.999 --> 19:28.543
I bet he could tell us
the exact year it was built.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.379
- 1949.
- Told you.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.840
One interesting fact:

19:34.007 --> 19:36.634
Peggy Carter herself oversaw
construction of this base.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.512
Most people know the legend
of Peggy Carter,

19:39.679 --> 19:43.516
but there's so many stories
that were never recorded.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.268
I remember one time...

19:52.567 --> 19:54.611
You're seeing their faces,
aren't you?

19:55.528 --> 19:58.072
Everyone else,
what's wrong with them?

19:58.239 --> 20:01.451
- Why don't they see it?
- I do.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.040
- How do I help them?
- You can't.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.626
- It's everywhere.
- There has to be a way for me to...

20:10.460 --> 20:12.962
It's everywhere!
Everywhere!

20:13.129 --> 20:16.507
Everywhere! Everywhere! Everywhere!

20:16.674 --> 20:18.009
What the hell is happening?

20:18.176 --> 20:24.724
Everywhere! Everywhere! Everywhere!

20:30.104 --> 20:32.649
He'll nap for an hour.
May, what happened?

20:32.815 --> 20:34.734
Did you say something
that made him...?

20:39.530 --> 20:41.241
Shame Simmons couldn't come with us.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.535
Seems the new parameters at HQ
come with nothing but more paperwork.

20:44.702 --> 20:45.954
Yeah, you're telling me.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.667
Inventory before deployment?
I mean, this is a lot of numbers.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.126
I'm a mechanic not an accountant.

20:52.293 --> 20:56.005
You're an engineer, Mack.
And a small tank.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.133
I can't tell if some of
our medication supply is missing or...

20:59.425 --> 21:01.010
I'm just too fried to figure it out.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.929
You are looking
a bit more feeble than usual.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.472
Thank you for that.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.604
It's these long deployments, Turbo.
Weeks at a time.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.358
I mean, Coulson loves it,
but the isolation gets to me.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.528
- Have you been seeing Yo-Yo?
- Yeah.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.154
Yeah, we Skype occasionally.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.573
Well, at least you're not
on the wild goose chase

21:22.657 --> 21:23.700
for Daisy anymore.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.910
We tried, man.

21:26.828 --> 21:29.831
- I promise you.
- Yeah, I know.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.335
Should be landing in about an hour.

21:40.174 --> 21:44.387
- All those years...
- My wife she's out there.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.264
- My life...
- Calm down.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.851
I don't have time to be calm.
What that backstabber did to us...

21:50.018 --> 21:53.646
It wasn't just him. It was you.
We trusted you.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.898
This is not my fault.
I had no idea.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.568
You shouldn't have used
the Darkhold.

21:58.735 --> 21:59.736
He's right.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.322
This is all because of your obsession
with that damn book.

22:02.488 --> 22:07.410
No. That book can help us now.
Fix us.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.912
Or give you the power you wanted
in the first place.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.999
Like we could ever find it.
He's years ahead of us.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.919
We will find the book and kill him.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.797
Along with anyone
who tries to stop us.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.646
I've seen a lot of breaks.
Your arm is fractured, not broken.

22:37.190 --> 22:40.109
Keep trying to bust out of that,
I can't guarantee it'll stay that way.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.614
- What are you doing?
- Looking for proof.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.576
You see, this is new for me.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.745
- I've never been...
- A kidnapper?

22:51.454 --> 22:52.622
Caught.

22:54.457 --> 22:58.836
You know who I am,
which is a problem for both of us.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.965
- A problem that has to go away.
- Threaten me all you want.

23:03.299 --> 23:06.511
- You think I'm afraid to die?
- I think you want it.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.680
No doubt.
You got a death wish.

23:10.181 --> 23:12.392
Coming back to find me
after I let you live.

23:15.186 --> 23:18.731
You told me not to.
Said you deserved it.

23:20.358 --> 23:21.859
I'm just looking for proof
that you do.

23:22.026 --> 23:25.738
- And then?
- My problem goes away.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.492
And your wish comes true.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.164
Vincent, calm down.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.135
Well, he has it the worst.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.765
I think he wants to know your plan.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.229
We're gonna find the book
and reverse what's been done to us.

23:58.396 --> 24:02.984
We'll make this right.
Hugo, you take those power cells.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.736
We're gonna need them.
Vincent and I will look for Joe.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.781
- And you...
- I'll burn this place to the ground.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.491
We all need to work together.

24:10.658 --> 24:16.038
I'm done working for you.
I mean, look what happened to us.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.708
- It would be smarter...
- You were never smarter!

24:18.875 --> 24:20.668
You just had the damn book.

24:21.544 --> 24:24.213
You don't control me anymore, Lucy.

24:26.090 --> 24:30.052
Take the boxes,
but I'm destroying this place.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.309
You've got ghosts haunting you.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.896
Something in your past
you can't live with.

24:40.062 --> 24:43.274
- You could just tell me.
- Haunting me?

24:43.441 --> 24:45.568
This coming from the guy
who thinks he's possessed.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.862
I prayed for vengeance. I got it.

24:48.529 --> 24:49.530
You?

24:51.532 --> 24:53.743
Fighting to right every wrong,

24:53.910 --> 24:56.412
all the while begging
to be taken out.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.832
Seems to me your thing
is serving penance.

25:09.634 --> 25:11.677
You know, we're not so different,
you and me.

25:15.598 --> 25:18.226
Yeah, you just feel bad
for the dead in your wake.

25:19.393 --> 25:20.645
I don't feel anything.

25:20.811 --> 25:23.272
If that were true,
you would've killed me by now.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.151
Are you really telling me
you don't feel curious

25:27.318 --> 25:28.945
about what's going on out there?

25:29.529 --> 25:32.573
You hunted those skinheads down.
Why?

25:33.574 --> 25:35.910
- They spilled innocent blood.
- Wow.

25:36.077 --> 25:38.579
Listen to you.
Take yourself seriously much?

25:39.330 --> 25:42.917
They were working with the Chinese.
Does that happen a lot around here?

25:44.585 --> 25:47.838
Didn't think so.
And outfitted with RPGs.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.424
You're not interested
in how these things are connected?

25:51.342 --> 25:54.136
Look, I know that the big picture
is kind of lost on you

25:54.303 --> 25:56.931
but someone is arming them,
uniting them

25:57.098 --> 25:58.349
and that should concern us both.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.893
- I said I'm not what you are.
- You're enhanced

26:01.060 --> 26:03.187
and you just said
that we're not that different.

26:03.354 --> 26:07.650
I'm sorry but you just said that
like ten seconds ago.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.653
They won't stop
until a lot of people are dead.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.530
- Or they are.
- And who knows what kind of weapon

26:12.697 --> 26:14.657
they stole from the energy lab
in Pasadena.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.534
Still haven't been able
to dig up any infor...

26:16.701 --> 26:18.786
Wait. What did you say?

26:18.995 --> 26:22.873
Momentum Alternative Energy Lab.
Print-out right there in your hands.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.668
Best I can tell, that's where
they stole the weapon from.

26:25.835 --> 26:28.421
But it's been shut down for years.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.716
Wait.
Does that mean something to you?

26:32.466 --> 26:34.844
- Robbie! No!
- Robbie!

26:36.512 --> 26:38.598
Robbie!

27:43.746 --> 27:45.247
Ah. Agent Simmons, there you are.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.417
Here's the Special Advisor
of Science and Technology.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.752
Glad you could finally make it.

27:50.544 --> 27:53.089
Yes, because we were supposed
to meet 15 minutes ago.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.590
Right. Unfortunately...

27:54.882 --> 27:56.300
Well, luckily,
the United States Congress

27:56.467 --> 27:58.552
is used to waiting around.
Right, guys?

27:58.719 --> 28:01.430
Because, I mean, how much work
really gets done in Washington?

28:01.889 --> 28:04.100
Although, you don't often wait
around for someone

28:04.266 --> 28:06.102
who's honestly changing the world.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.937
Oh, I don't know if I'm doing that.

28:08.104 --> 28:09.563
So why don't you go ahead
and tell us

28:09.730 --> 28:10.981
what you were working on
that kept you?

28:11.148 --> 28:13.984
Word of advice, everything she does
is hugely fascinating

28:14.443 --> 28:17.279
and I understand none of it,
so feel free to smile and nod.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.614
It's what I do.

28:19.115 --> 28:21.450
Well,
I was just in the containment rooms.

28:21.617 --> 28:22.618
Ah, yes.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.287
One of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most important
advances in recent years.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.332
It uses adaptive materials
to contain enhanced individuals

28:28.499 --> 28:30.876
and actually neutralises
their powers.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.337
Oh, neutralise powers,
that does sound useful.

28:33.546 --> 28:36.382
- I'd love to see them.
- Great idea.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.926
But maybe not the best idea,
Director.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.388
Excuse me.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.183
Guess not. What happened?

28:47.017 --> 28:48.269
There was an incident.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.564
Blood everywhere. Not a great time.

28:54.859 --> 28:57.486
Turns out it wasn't the best idea,

28:57.653 --> 29:00.030
because Agent Coulson here
has a better one.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.783
Who wants to step inside
a real-life Quinjet?

29:03.993 --> 29:05.453
Let's go.

29:12.293 --> 29:15.045
Chen? Do we have any idea
what set him off?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.006
Have you spoken to May lately?

29:19.842 --> 29:20.760
Creepy.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.344
You ever notice we never get
to check up

29:22.428 --> 29:26.015
on a bright-lit place filled
with nice, friendly people?

29:36.525 --> 29:37.526
Mack.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.238
Looks like
a short electrical transient

29:41.405 --> 29:43.282
set off a quick current spike,
other side of that door.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.401
Oh, boy.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.239
Mack, we got a big problem.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.865
The reactor terminals are set to...

30:24.949 --> 30:26.075
Whoa!

30:28.661 --> 30:31.372
Great. This guy disappears.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.707
I hate these guys.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.043
Where'd he go?
Think you scared him off?

30:37.294 --> 30:39.296
What do you think the chances
of that are, Turbo?

30:48.848 --> 30:49.890
May?

30:51.267 --> 30:52.142
What's up?

30:52.726 --> 30:57.022
The base has been infiltrated.
Something got in.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.024
So, you thought you'd redecorate?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.943
Maybe somebody brought something in,

31:01.110 --> 31:02.778
something that's getting
to everyone.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.197
And if you find it,
you can destroy it.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.283
Yeah. That's right.

31:07.449 --> 31:11.328
Always ready to do the brave thing.
Always looking out for us.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.247
I won't let them take you.

31:18.669 --> 31:21.338
May, what if we stop,
take a minute?

31:21.755 --> 31:22.965
Rest, make a plan.

31:23.132 --> 31:25.593
I can't. I can't. No time.

31:29.680 --> 31:30.681
You know what?

31:30.848 --> 31:32.349
We have current blood samples
on file

31:32.558 --> 31:35.394
for every S.H.I.E.L.D. agent,
even the Director.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.606
That could help us figure out
who's been infected.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.695
We just have to go to the lab.
How does that sound?

31:47.698 --> 31:48.699
Yeah.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.285
He's like the woman
who got Chen,

31:51.452 --> 31:53.704
so if he does come back,
you can't let him touch you.

31:53.871 --> 31:55.039
You'll go crazy.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.332
Don't let him touch you!

32:02.963 --> 32:04.590
He must've set the reactor
to blow.

32:05.549 --> 32:06.967
What are you talking about?
Blow up a building?

32:07.051 --> 32:08.886
I mean, no, it could be
a couple of city blocks.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.013
Then what are you talking to me for,
man? Shut it down!

32:11.096 --> 32:12.222
You're the one
who keeps asking me questions!

32:12.306 --> 32:13.724
I'm trying to shut it down
if you give me five...

32:19.480 --> 32:23.275
- We can help you.
- No. You can't.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.622
Wait. No.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.710
May? You all right?

32:42.711 --> 32:44.630
Why do you want me
to go to the lab so badly?

32:44.797 --> 32:46.340
I told you so we can...

32:47.925 --> 32:48.926
Okay, look.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.095
There's a situation you need
to be aware of.

32:51.887 --> 32:53.013
I'm aware.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.227
And I'm gonna stop them!

33:06.735 --> 33:08.070
She's sick! Don't hurt her!

33:24.545 --> 33:26.922
May! May, stop. It's me.

33:34.388 --> 33:36.432
May, wait! Please.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.727
You're not well. I can help.

33:41.437 --> 33:44.231
Phil, I'm doing what has to be done.

33:45.733 --> 33:46.734
So am I.

33:55.159 --> 33:58.203
Agent May,
I urge you to stop now.

34:03.042 --> 34:08.797
- You're a monster.
- I prefer the term "Inhuman."

34:14.844 --> 34:15.804
I'm sorry about this.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.021
Too bad you can't put that
on the tour.

34:25.856 --> 34:26.815
Not yet.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.822
- Where is he?
- Turbo, get me out of here!

34:35.364 --> 34:36.366
I don't understand.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.659
He's keeping the reactor
in meltdown.

34:42.164 --> 34:45.667
I won't go back.
I'll kill you all first.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.837
- I don't know what you mean.
- It was hell in there.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.130
Fitz!

34:59.431 --> 35:00.557
What are you?

35:05.687 --> 35:07.397
Yeah. What are you?

35:07.898 --> 35:09.316
Fitz, get me out of here!

35:10.526 --> 35:11.652
Yeah, I got it.

35:15.405 --> 35:16.406
Ah! It's stuck!

35:16.573 --> 35:18.909
I really wish our roles
were reversed right now.

35:23.997 --> 35:24.998
Fitz.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.296
We need to turn the reactor off.

35:46.603 --> 35:47.604
It's done.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.660
No. No, no, no. Don't.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.338
There, is that too tight?

36:17.509 --> 36:20.262
So that fire-headed Inhuman...

36:20.429 --> 36:22.472
He's not an Inhuman.

36:23.932 --> 36:27.060
- I'm not sure what he is.
- I am. He's a killer.

36:27.728 --> 36:29.188
That truck heist in East LA,

36:29.354 --> 36:31.148
three people
were brutally murdered.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.567
- What if they deserved it?
- Is that how it is now?

36:33.734 --> 36:37.321
You're running with a vigilante
who decides who lives or dies?

36:39.615 --> 36:41.200
I'm not running with anyone.

36:42.492 --> 36:43.869
But he can't be all bad.

36:44.453 --> 36:46.496
He came here tonight
and he saved Fitz's life.

36:46.955 --> 36:49.041
Yeah, but from what?
What was that thing?

36:49.208 --> 36:51.043
I have no idea.

36:56.173 --> 36:57.466
Daisy, come home with us.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.469
So, we can properly take care
of that arm.

37:00.802 --> 37:04.181
We have a drug that can help
those bones heal faster.

37:05.182 --> 37:08.644
Now, our supply keeps running low
but we're about to...

37:15.275 --> 37:17.110
But you already have it, don't you?

37:32.709 --> 37:33.752
It's Yo-Yo.

37:36.046 --> 37:40.926
She's stealing it and you two
have been in touch this whole time.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.973
We've been out there looking
for you,

37:46.723 --> 37:50.352
trying to protect you and put
the pieces back together, and you...

37:51.937 --> 37:54.147
Why? Why are you doing this?

37:54.314 --> 37:56.441
Because she's turned her back on us,
Mack!

37:56.608 --> 37:58.360
Because something terrible happened

37:58.527 --> 37:59.945
and she didn't want our help
getting through it.

38:00.112 --> 38:01.029
Slow down, Turbo.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.489
Well, we've all been
through terrible things...

38:02.572 --> 38:04.992
all of us
and we've never turned our back!

38:15.460 --> 38:18.505
I'm doing what I need to do.

38:21.008 --> 38:25.220
And it still affects us.
Like it or not.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.352
Thank you for the splint.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.362
- Hey, can we get a picture?
- Sure.

38:42.529 --> 38:46.074
- Hey, um... Do you mind?
- Not at all.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.370
Okay.

38:51.788 --> 38:54.708
Nice and close, nice and tight.
There we go.

38:54.875 --> 38:56.543
You know I love a photo op, right?

38:59.046 --> 39:00.172
All right.

39:01.757 --> 39:02.758
Nice.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.177
Now, as tempting as it may be
to post these pictures on Facebook,

39:05.344 --> 39:07.804
Snapchat,
your re-election campaign website...

39:09.014 --> 39:10.974
...everything you saw today
is confidential.

39:11.141 --> 39:12.142
You all signed an NDA,

39:12.309 --> 39:13.685
and unlike
the Climate Change Accord,

39:13.852 --> 39:15.270
this one's enforceable.

39:15.437 --> 39:16.938
So if all goes well,
we hope it does.

39:17.105 --> 39:19.524
Next time we do this,
it'll be much more public.

39:19.691 --> 39:20.901
Safe ride home, my friends.

39:21.068 --> 39:23.695
- Thanks, Director.
- Thanks for coming. Bye-bye.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.364
- You got a moment?
- Sure.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.741
It's about May.
I have a plan that I think will...

39:27.908 --> 39:30.577
Oh, don't worry, Phil.
I've got it handled.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.247
The thing is,
my experience can help here.

39:34.414 --> 39:38.085
- I dealt with a similar situation...
- When you were the director. I know.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.712
Phil, am I getting something wrong?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.090
This was your idea.

39:44.091 --> 39:45.884
When you stepped down,
you told the president

39:46.051 --> 39:47.552
you didn't want to be the face
of the agency.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.970
For a whole host of reasons.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.889
And you said
we needed a new face.

39:51.598 --> 39:55.268
And now that Steve Rogers
went AWOL, you wanted a hero.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.187
I said the new director
should be a powered person

39:57.354 --> 40:00.440
the public could trust.
And they came up with you.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.442
And now you're stuck with me.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.446
I count on you to be one
of my top advisors.

40:06.613 --> 40:08.281
There's no one better
than you, truly.

40:08.490 --> 40:12.953
- Okay. So...
- But when it comes to May and Daisy...

40:13.829 --> 40:15.163
you can't be objective.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.625
And to that, I take exception.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.796
So, you focus
on being the best agent we got,

40:23.588 --> 40:25.882
and I'll focus on being
the best director I can.

40:26.049 --> 40:28.552
But what treatment
are you implementing?

40:28.718 --> 40:30.929
- How long will...
- Hey. I'm sorry.

40:32.514 --> 40:33.640
That's classified.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.694
Get away from me.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.614
Get away from me.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.702
Get away from me!

40:53.869 --> 40:55.495
Get away from me!

40:56.705 --> 40:58.165
Get away!

41:21.313 --> 41:23.523
Come on, come on, come on.

41:24.024 --> 41:26.109
Come on!

41:35.577 --> 41:36.745
Your friends with you?

41:38.038 --> 41:41.374
- No. I left them.
- Good.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.629
You want to know
what's connecting these things.

41:46.296 --> 41:47.339
Yeah.

41:51.468 --> 41:52.928
I think it might be me.
