My parents didn't give a shit about me.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.031
They were just too busy
fighting each other.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.398
You were like my best friend.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.438
But it was more than that.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.030
It was like you were a part of me.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.520
I freaked out...

37:52.640 --> 37:55.314
...but I never meant to hurt you.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.192
Well, you did.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.711

makes sense.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.309
And then God looks at you
and calls you a cunt

38:13.360 --> 38:14.794

It's really weird how those pirates
came in the night and stole him.

38:47.560 --> 38:50.518
I'm pretty sure my parents
were lying about that.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.834
That he died.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.718
They didn't want me to be upset.
