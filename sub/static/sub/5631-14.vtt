male announcer:
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.776 --> 00:12.146
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.482
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.482 --> 00:16.384
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.384 --> 00:17.785
are members of an elite squad

00:17.785 --> 00:19.953
known as the
Special Victims Unit.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.689
These are their stories.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.701
[oven door snaps shut]

00:54.155 --> 00:57.691
- Voight,
something's come up.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.428
So Dr. Yates is now claiming

01:00.428 --> 01:02.963
that some of the bones
that we found at Pelham Bay,

01:02.963 --> 01:05.499
the Jane Doe vics
that we never IDed,

01:05.499 --> 01:09.937
may be the remains
of runaway Midwestern girls.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.139
- Oh, it could be.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.840
We do have some open
missing persons cases

01:12.840 --> 01:14.908
from when he was here
in Chicago.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.679
I mean, young women who fit
his MO--working girls, nurses.

01:18.679 --> 01:22.250
- Yeah, that's why
I'm calling you.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.686
- And he just offered this up
for humanitarian reasons?

01:25.686 --> 01:27.255
- Oh, no, no.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.957
He says that he wants
to discuss it with Rollins.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.192
- And she's still on
maternity leave.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.826
- No, she's back,

01:32.826 --> 01:35.062
but I just don't want her
anywhere near him,

01:35.062 --> 01:39.567
and these are...
Chicago vics.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.702
- So you want me
to send Lindsay?

01:41.702 --> 01:44.538
- I think that he would
talk to her.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.039
- Erin still hasn't
forgiven herself

01:46.039 --> 01:48.242
for what Yates did to Nadia.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.445
- Maybe she can use that.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.183
We'll keep each other posted?

01:55.183 --> 01:56.850
- Mmm.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.520
- Thank you.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.590

[dialogue not audible]

02:21.609 --> 02:29.650
*

02:43.264 --> 02:45.098
- Yates.

02:45.098 --> 02:49.403
- Yes,
these are disturbing.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.939
Fractured skulls,
broken hyoid bones.

02:51.939 --> 02:55.909
These girls were driven
all the way from Chicago

02:55.909 --> 02:58.111
to that bleak Bronx boneyard,

02:58.111 --> 03:01.782
that same place that, uh,

03:01.782 --> 03:04.252
your friend Nadia
was found.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.719
- After you murdered her.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.388
- Dr. Yates,
we're here because we heard

03:07.388 --> 03:09.657
you might have information
about these victims.

03:09.657 --> 03:12.426
- Who they were,
how they got there.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.961
Where did they come from?

03:13.961 --> 03:15.463
- Why don't you start
with who they are.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.965
- These are just bones,
yeah?

03:17.965 --> 03:20.067
You couldn't find DNA
on any of them,

03:20.067 --> 03:24.137
so I will guess that
they came from working girls.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.274
- Guess?
You told SVU

03:26.274 --> 03:28.075
some of these victims
might have been from Chicago.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.278
- Did I?
Oh, yeah.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.812
- We have some
missing persons photos

03:31.812 --> 03:33.881
we'd like you to take
a look at.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.949
- Mmm.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.624
Hmm, so young.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.794
I...don't imagine
that's what they looked like

03:46.794 --> 03:48.296
when their killer
encountered them.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.097
- Where?

03:50.097 --> 03:52.132
- Maybe at a truck stop

03:52.132 --> 03:54.735
whoring themselves out
for cocaine.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.739
You must know
the power of addiction.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.910
- We're here to talk
about these girls, not me.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.213
- Nadia talked a lot about you.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.449
On our drive...

04:08.449 --> 04:12.720
how Sergeant Voight
took you off the street.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.855
Mentored you.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.325
That man has a lot of anger.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.527
It must have...

04:19.527 --> 04:22.896
been very scary
growing up in his home.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.398
- We're done.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.500
- Sorry you wasted
your trip.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.469
- I'm sure.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.904
- Tell the warden
I'd be much more comfortable

04:30.904 --> 04:33.374
talking with Detective Rollins.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.842
- She's not coming up here.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.210
- Why not--ohh.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.780
She must have
had her baby by now.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.349
[breathless laugh]

04:41.349 --> 04:43.551
Is it a boy or a girl?

04:43.551 --> 04:45.686
- That is none of
your business.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.822
- You want closure
for those families?

04:48.822 --> 04:51.859
Get her here.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.161
By tomorrow.

04:58.265 --> 05:01.369
[dramatic music]

05:44.445 --> 05:44.578
.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.113
- I knew I should have
gone up there.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.948
- Rollins.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.216
- What--he didn't give you
anything, did he?

05:49.216 --> 05:50.551
- I don't know that he has
anything to give.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.786
- He never shows his cards
on the first pass,

05:52.786 --> 05:55.623
and nothing's for free.
What'd he ask for?

05:55.623 --> 05:57.958
- He wants to speak with you.
- He's bored.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.860
He gets off on pulling
everybody's strings.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.662
- He gave us Rudnick, and he
knows more about those bones

06:01.662 --> 06:03.263
than he's ever let on.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.498
- Yeah--still claiming
those bodies

06:04.498 --> 06:06.233
might be from Chicago girls?
Come on.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.001
- We do have these four women
who went missing

06:08.001 --> 06:09.236
when Yates moved to Chicago.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.638
One of them's a working girl

06:10.638 --> 06:12.239
who was a patient
at his urgent care center.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.007
- And he did seem
to recognize her.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.009
He could have driven her east
like he did with Nadia.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.445
- Isn't he appealing
that conviction?

06:17.445 --> 06:19.346
I mean, why would he confess
to more crimes?

06:19.346 --> 06:21.214
- No, but he doesn't confess.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.783
I keep the conversation
hypothetical,

06:22.783 --> 06:24.585
and he just fills in the blanks.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.119
- Look, Sergeant Voight
would really like

06:26.119 --> 06:27.455
to give these girls' families
some answers.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.923
- I know.
Okay.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.592
But Carisi, you go with.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.828
- Hey, but, there's no point
in sending him.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.030
Yates isn't even going to make
eye contact with him,

06:37.030 --> 06:39.032
and there's COs everywhere.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.001
- Rollins, we know Yates.

06:41.001 --> 06:45.473
He's probably been playing them
since the moment he got there.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.042
- Last week,
we talked about resolving

06:49.042 --> 06:52.279
interpersonal conflicts
without anger or violence.

06:52.279 --> 06:55.483
Did anyone try to employ
the techniques we discussed?

06:55.483 --> 06:57.485
- I tried to see
a certain situation

06:57.485 --> 07:00.320
from the other person's
point of view.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.923
- And I did, too, because
what's weird to one person

07:02.923 --> 07:05.025
may seem normal to another.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.527
- That's great, Jose.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.729
All right, let's pair up.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.499
First, sit face to face.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.166
Don't say anything,

07:13.166 --> 07:16.003
but see if you can sense
your partner's emotions.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.404
Dr. Yates.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.639
- I'm sorry I'm late.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.008
I got held up
in the law library.

07:21.008 --> 07:25.345
There are so many people in here
who need my help.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.747
- We're glad to have you.

07:26.747 --> 07:30.317
We've paired off with
empathy partners for the day.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.052
- I think Dr. Rudnick and I

07:32.052 --> 07:35.255
have some issues
we need to work through.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.690
- No problem.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.693
[ominous music]

07:39.693 --> 07:43.531
*

07:43.531 --> 07:45.298
- Doctor.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.569
- Mrs. Wilkins
still bringing you those...

07:48.569 --> 07:51.171
deep pan trays of lasagna?

07:51.171 --> 07:54.542
*

07:54.542 --> 07:56.977
- That shouldn't
concern you.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.379
- But it does.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.983
Home cooking...
you just can't beat it.

08:02.983 --> 08:07.187
*

08:07.187 --> 08:08.556
- Four detectives in two days?

08:08.556 --> 08:10.591
Yates usually
isn't this popular.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.892
- How's he getting on here?

08:11.892 --> 08:13.627
- Well-behaved,
no problems,

08:13.627 --> 08:15.596
volunteers in the law library
and the hospital.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.997
Model inmate, really.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.399
- Kind of strange for a guy
who's never getting paroled.

08:19.399 --> 08:23.070
- Oh, sometimes lifers get Zen,
try to make the best of it.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.772
- Really?

08:24.772 --> 08:26.039
- Or they want to get
transferred further upstate.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.741
Either way, he's settled in.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.210
Anything you need, let me know.
[door buzzes]

08:32.780 --> 08:33.914
- You see that?

08:33.914 --> 08:35.683
Yates charmed the warden.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.085
It's classic sociopath.
It's classic.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.688
- I know, Carisi.
I know.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.292
- Detective.

08:47.427 --> 08:50.998
Motherhood becomes you.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.933
- Thank you.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.769
- How'd you lose
the baby weight so fast?

08:55.769 --> 08:57.838
You are glowing.
Are you breastfeeding?

08:57.838 --> 08:59.272
You know the hormones
can do wonders.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.909
- Okay, that's enough.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.111
- That's okay, Carisi.

09:04.111 --> 09:08.782
- I suppose it was too much for
me to expect you to come alone,

09:08.782 --> 09:11.785
and I have to say,
I was a bit hurt

09:11.785 --> 09:14.855
that you sent the Chicago
detectives in your stead.

09:14.855 --> 09:18.626
- Well, she's here now, Yates,
so let's get on with it.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.130
- You said you might know
something about these girls.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.331
Her?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.399
Said she could have been
a working girl?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.101
- Ooh, those blue eyes.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.772
Though, I doubt she ended up
in Pelham Bay.

09:31.772 --> 09:35.943
- But you do have a theory...
about where she did end up.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.811
- If I had to guess,

09:37.811 --> 09:40.648
she was turning tricks
at a truck stop

09:40.648 --> 09:42.850
between Chicago and Gary.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.018
I-90 most likely.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.088
But if something
happened to her out there

09:48.088 --> 09:50.658
in the...dark at night,

09:50.658 --> 09:55.663
she's probably just...
waiting in the weeds.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.799
- Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

09:58.799 --> 10:03.704
- And these other girls...
are they in Pelham Bay?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.639
- Possibly.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.907
- Possibly.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.042
- But you know how this works,

10:09.042 --> 10:10.778
Amanda.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.680
To get...

10:12.680 --> 10:15.949
you have to give.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.985
- Yates wants to be transferred
to Honor Block.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.987
- He's a serial killer.
That's not happening.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.855
- Actually,
once you're in prison,

10:21.855 --> 10:23.590
whatever you did to get there
doesn't really matter.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.992
They use the carrot
of the Honor Block

10:24.992 --> 10:26.894
to encourage good behavior.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.528
- He's not capable
of good behavior.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.397
- He did make one show
of good faith.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.065
- He knows something
about our girls?

10:32.065 --> 10:34.735
- Siobhan Kelly, the patient
at his urgent care center--

10:34.735 --> 10:38.538
he suggested you check
truck stops outside of Gary.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.008
- I'll loop in Voight.
- And he may know more,

10:41.008 --> 10:43.410
but he's not going to say
anything until he's transferred.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.745
- Of course he won't.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.113
- Lieutenant,
is this a good idea?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.981
- I doubt the warden
would approve that.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.349
- Find out.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.085
I want you both
back here tonight.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.590
- Does it have to be
Honor Block?

10:57.590 --> 10:58.992
We can offer solitary.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.828
- Yates says he's afraid
he'll go crazy.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.062
It's the Honor Block
or bust.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.897
- You did say
he was a model inmate.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.233
- Yes, and we thought about
transferring him out of Gen Pop,

11:06.233 --> 11:08.769
but Rudnick
is in the Honor Block.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.603
We understand
they have a history.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.006
- Yeah, yeah, they do.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.910
Yates ratted out Rudnick.
Rudnick killed Yates's fiancée.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.746
- So this could be a ploy

11:18.746 --> 11:20.748
for Yates to get revenge
against Rudnick?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.615
- It could be.

11:22.615 --> 11:26.653
But if Yates was intent on that,
it would have happened already.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.121
- I'd like to talk to Rudnick.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.991
He's an odd one.
I'm not sure how he'll react.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.325
- No disrespect, Warden.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.660
I don't want to step on
anybody's toes here,

11:33.660 --> 11:35.528
but, uh, he and I
have a good rapport.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.198
Maybe I can sound him out.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.632
- Yates wants to be here?

11:39.632 --> 11:41.201
- Mm-hmm.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.170
- Well, whatever Yates wants,
I suppose.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.671
- Listen,
you do have the right

11:44.671 --> 11:46.539
to transfer out
when he moves in.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.508
- Oh, dear no,
that wouldn't do.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.144
But to be perfectly candid,
I'm not worried about Yates.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.047
I can handle that
pedestrian sociopath.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.483
I always have.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.186
- Well, nobody wants
to put you in jeopardy.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.088
- Well, thank you,
Detective.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.823
You're a gentleman.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.057
And, whatever happens
going forward,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.592
I appreciate you
showing me respect.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.795
- Of course.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.199
- Might I ask what kind of
leverage he used

12:12.199 --> 12:13.801
to get transferred?

12:13.801 --> 12:15.535
- Come on, Doc, you know
I can't tell you that.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.305
- Well, in any case,
you were kind to visit again.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.874
I hope you're not
still eating bacon.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.275
You did see

12:22.275 --> 12:24.111
the World Health Organization
study, yes?

12:24.111 --> 12:26.713
- Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.816
I've been trying to cut back.
- Good.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.483
People always say
life is short,

12:30.483 --> 12:35.722
but, in fact, life is
mostly, of course, very long.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.158
You want to stay
in your best shape.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.228
- Thanks, Doc.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.298
- Yates's transfer went through,

12:45.298 --> 12:47.835
but it's too late
to talk to him again today.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.169
We're heading back.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.039
I've got to relieve my sitter
anyway, but, listen,

12:52.039 --> 12:54.341
tomorrow morning we can drive up
here first thing and we can--

12:54.341 --> 12:56.476
- No, absolutely not, Rollins.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.045
Yates got to talk to you.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.247
From now on,
he has to talk to me.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.482
Am I making myself clear?

13:02.482 --> 13:04.885
- Copy that, Lieutenant.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.087
- She doesn't want you coming
back up here again, right?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.355
I don't blame her.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.523
- Why? Why does everybody
keep saying that?

13:10.523 --> 13:13.360
I mean, you saw us together.
It was fine.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.728
- Yeah, he's got your number.
- [scoffs]

13:15.728 --> 13:17.330
You think Rudnick
doesn't have yours?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.631
- Not really.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.067
I mean, I just like
talking to the guy, you know?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.869
He's got his own worldview.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.771
- I rest my case.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.006
- Hey, what's the holdup?

13:26.006 --> 13:29.576
- Sorry, folks.
Just give us a minute.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.743
Oh.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.179
[buzzer]
Sorry about that.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.784
- Carl.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.319
Just like old times.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.288
We're going to be block mates.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.457
- Yes.
So I'm told.

13:47.560 --> 13:52.265
- Our Mrs. Wilkins really is
a miracle worker, isn't she?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.801
- Yates, let's go.

13:54.801 --> 13:57.170
- Just so we're clear,

13:57.170 --> 14:00.908
I'm going to be there
when that miracle occurs.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.911
[ominous music]

14:10.951 --> 14:11.084
.

14:11.985 --> 14:12.819
- Well,
Green Haven hasn't changed.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.323
Long drive up.
I hope it's worth the trip.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.691
- Look, I'm not letting him talk
to Rollins anymore, all right?

14:18.691 --> 14:22.429
If he wants to stay
on Honor Block, no more games.

14:24.164 --> 14:27.667
Barba, I didn't know that Uber
came up to Green Haven.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.302
- Just promise me
you won't to stop to eat

14:29.302 --> 14:30.938
before we go back to the city.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.839
- Guys,
they're ready for us.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.476
- Sorry to keep
you folks waiting.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.678
We're almost finished
moving Gen Pop into the yard.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.647
Once that's done,
we'll bring you to Yates.

14:40.647 --> 14:41.949
- Understood.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.750
Thank you for making
the transfer happen so quickly.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.418
- How did it go
last night?

14:45.418 --> 14:46.853
- So far, so good.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.989
Yates and Rudnick spent
their first night together

14:48.989 --> 14:51.091
in the Honor Block
without incident.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.326
My staff tells me they were
cordial to each other

14:53.326 --> 14:54.661
at morning head count.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.996
- That's good to know.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.731
By the way, my father,
William Dodds, sends his best.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.301
- Oh, I see the resemblance.
Tell him I said hello.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.003
- The sooner
we can meet with Yates,

15:03.003 --> 15:04.437
the sooner we'll be
out of your way.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.239
- Oh, we're fine.
Whenever you can.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.041
- Of course.
They're about done.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.142
Go to the block.
Bring Yates down.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.078
- Copy that.
- Thank you.

15:11.078 --> 15:15.448
- Have Honor Block inmate Yates,
number 14005, ready for escort.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.651
- Visitors again?
Yates has a lot of friends.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.187
Yates.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.323
Silva!

15:23.323 --> 15:25.625
Put that thing down.
- Sorry.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.860
- Where's Yates?
- How would I know?

15:27.860 --> 15:30.230
He just got here.
Maybe the law library?

15:30.230 --> 15:32.332
I ain't seen him
since head count this morning.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.434
- Does your bunkie know?
- Dr. Rudnick?

15:34.434 --> 15:37.270
He's in the clinic
doing his volunteer work.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.013
- Whoa, hey.
You okay?

15:46.013 --> 15:47.280
- [exhales]

15:47.280 --> 15:48.748
- Listen.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.850
My, uh, my sister
took some melatonin

15:50.850 --> 15:52.619
when she got
a little postpartum.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.021
- I'm not depressed,
Carisi.

15:54.021 --> 15:56.389
I'm--you know,
I'm pissed off.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.625
- Why? 'Cause Liv won't let you
go back up to Green Haven?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.127
- Exactly.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.462
Because Yates, he gets
one look at Benson, Dodds,

16:02.462 --> 16:03.763
and Barba up there,
and he's gonna think

16:03.763 --> 16:05.365
that they're all ganging up
on him, or worse,

16:05.365 --> 16:06.933
he's gonna think that I pulled
a bait and switch on him.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.435
- Worse?

16:08.435 --> 16:10.437
Why, you're worried about your
relationship with Yates now?

16:10.437 --> 16:12.039
- Yeah,
that's exactly what I meant.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.040
[thud]
[grunts]

16:13.040 --> 16:14.941
[clatters]

16:14.941 --> 16:16.609
Ha ho!

16:18.345 --> 16:19.879
What?
- Eh...

16:19.879 --> 16:21.514
you know,
I'm just glad to see

16:21.514 --> 16:23.283
how motherhood's
really mellowed you out.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.185
- Ha.

16:25.185 --> 16:29.422
That's another thing--
I...I hate being coddled.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.258
You know, what...

16:31.258 --> 16:33.193
I have a baby,
and all of a sudden

16:33.193 --> 16:36.129
I can't talk
to serial killers anymore.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.334
- So your father
knows the warden?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.803
- Yeah, he knows everybody.
He kind of makes a point of it.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.738
- Hang on.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.774
What are those?
Drones?

16:47.774 --> 16:50.177
- That is exactly what they are.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.180
[suspenseful music]

16:53.180 --> 16:57.384
*

16:57.384 --> 16:59.419
- Everybody down on the ground!

16:59.419 --> 17:02.589
Code blue, Alpha yard.
Code blue.

17:02.589 --> 17:03.823
- I haven't seen
Yates all day.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.958
- Are you sure?
- It's a shoe box in here.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.560
Look for yourself.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.263
- I repeat, code blue.
All blocks restrict movement.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.499
No one on or off.
CERT has been alerted.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.268
- I heard about this.
Ohio, Mansfield, I think.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.570
They used drones
to drop guns and drugs.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.972
[excited shouting]

17:19.972 --> 17:22.642
- Oh, God, we got another one.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.544
CERT to Alpha and Bravo yards.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.580
[alarm blares]

17:27.580 --> 17:30.817
- Three drones.
I repeat, three drones.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.222
- What the hell
is taking so long?

17:35.222 --> 17:38.591
- CERT's on their way.
They'll get this under control.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.160
- [shouts]

17:40.160 --> 17:42.129
- Thank you, Sergeant.
That's very comforting.

17:42.129 --> 17:45.432
- Counselor, we're in here.
They're out there. Relax.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.134
- I'm perfectly relaxed.
- Guys, please.

17:47.134 --> 17:50.137
[tense music]

17:50.137 --> 17:54.774
*

17:54.774 --> 17:56.709
- Drugs, phone.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.545
Holy crap.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.647
How small is this gun?

18:00.647 --> 18:02.515
- Now we're going to have
to check the spokes

18:02.515 --> 18:05.485
of all these waterheads.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.854
- No, we haven't
heard anything yet.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.822
Okay, we'll let you know.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.691
Voight wants us back tonight.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.827
- We should at least wait to
find out what Yates had to say.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.996
- Okay, thanks.
Just tried Barba's office.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.798
They haven't heard from him
in four hours.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.333
- What the hell's going on
up there?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.269
- Hopefully Yates is talking.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.471
I mean, I'll try
the warden again.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.907
- Vermentino.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.876
[police radio chatter]
Morales.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.811
Jefferson.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.080
Yates.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.686
Where the hell is Yates now?

18:39.686 --> 18:41.588
- Rudnick's still missing too.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.625
- Where are they?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.594
- How should I know?
- Start talking, Silva,

18:47.594 --> 18:49.962
or you're back into Gen Pop
without your blankie.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.231
- They'll kill me
if I say anything.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.800
- Whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
Jose, amiguito,

18:53.800 --> 18:55.668
say anything about what?

18:55.668 --> 18:57.470
- I don't know nothing.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.473
[tense music]

19:00.473 --> 19:08.548
*

19:12.219 --> 19:15.222
- We have a situation
in the Honor Block.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.924
Possible escape.
Code blue.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.492
- Yates is missing?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.827
- We're having
trouble locating him.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.629
- What about Rudnick?

19:22.629 --> 19:24.564
- My understanding is that
they are both unaccounted for.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.932
- What does that mean?
- There was some kind of

19:25.932 --> 19:27.967
internal damage
in Rudnick's cell.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.403
There was an opening
cut into the wall.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.771
- Hold on.
They escaped?

19:31.771 --> 19:32.972
- They're probably trapped

19:32.972 --> 19:34.641
somewhere in the prison
infrastructure.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.908
- A hole in the cell?

19:35.908 --> 19:37.744
They had help.
- We're investigating.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.079
Of course, no one on that
block knows anything.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.982
- Does he have a cell mate?

19:42.982 --> 19:44.717
- I know what you went
through with William Lewis.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.653
He was a bad man.
It wasn't right.

19:46.653 --> 19:49.155
- Talk to us
about Rudnick and Yates.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.157
- Okay, they'll kill me.
Those guys are scary.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.525
- We can get you
transferred out.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.962
- I know you?
- You can trust me, Jose.

19:55.962 --> 20:00.166
How did Rudnick
cut a hole in the wall?

20:00.166 --> 20:02.535
- He must have
got tools somehow.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.437
- Well, how long
has this been going on?

20:04.437 --> 20:06.273
- A few months.
He--he'd work nights.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.308
He told me to shut my eyes
and pretend to be asleep

20:08.308 --> 20:09.776
or he wouldn't take me.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.011
- And how did Yates
get involved?

20:12.011 --> 20:13.613
- Dr. Rudnick didn't want that,

20:13.613 --> 20:15.948
but this morning
b-before head count,

20:15.948 --> 20:19.852
Yates said he was going...
and Rudnick said yes.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.622
- What was the plan?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.524
Jose Silva told us
that they'd figured out

20:24.524 --> 20:25.992
how to get
past the prison walls.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.827
- That would be
my worst nightmare.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.829
- Tell me that after Dannemora,
you sealed everything up.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.131
- We did.
Welded all the manholes shut.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.833
Checked every access point.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.568
- Okay, water, sewage.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.070
What's this?
- High-pressure steam.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.407
If they went in there,
they got fried.

20:41.641 --> 20:44.010
- This pipe's not hot.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.579
If it were on, it'd be hotter
in here, right?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.681
- ConElectric was doing
repairs last night.

20:48.681 --> 20:52.018
They said they'd have it
shut off for a few hours.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.120
- Son of a bitch.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.356
- Where does this pipe go?
- They couldn't have gotten out.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.891
- Warden, where does it go?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.396
- We had that sealed
over the summer.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.831
- Rudnick
has family money.

21:04.831 --> 21:08.768
He probably bribed somebody
to unseal it.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.604
- They left this for us.
- A note.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.707
"I think I'll miss you
most of all, Scarecrow."

21:14.707 --> 21:16.943
- Is that green nail polish?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.878
It's one of Yates's signatures.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.146
- Where's that ConEl crew?

21:20.146 --> 21:21.748
- Got a body over here!

21:23.916 --> 21:26.353
- Was he shot?
Are they armed?

21:26.353 --> 21:28.588
- Looks like a snapped neck.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.390
- Look, these guys
worked in two-man crews.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.924
Where's his partner?

21:31.924 --> 21:34.794
[dramatic music]

21:34.794 --> 21:36.596
- Can you get that down?

21:36.596 --> 21:39.899
- Detective Rollins comes
to visit Yates, and he escapes.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.869
Any particular reason why you've
come up here instead of her?

21:42.869 --> 21:44.371
- My detective did not

21:44.371 --> 21:46.506
help Yates
break out of prison.

21:46.506 --> 21:49.376
- She fought to get him
transferred to the Honor Block.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.877
- Because she knows him
better than anyone else.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.812
It was the only way
we could get him to cooperate.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.246
- Rollins
didn't order those drones,

21:54.246 --> 21:55.882
and she didn't cut a hole
in Rudnick's cell wall.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.384
This has been
planned for months.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.218
- Look, he had to have outside
help--visitors, volunteers.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.187
I mean, maybe even COs.

22:01.187 --> 22:04.391
- Believe me, my intelligence
unit is already making a list.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.125
- Lieutenant.

22:06.125 --> 22:11.498
*

22:11.498 --> 22:12.865
It's another snapped neck.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.266
- They killed the guys
that helped them escape.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.802
- They're not taking
any chances.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.137
- And they won't hesitate
to kill again.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.539
- When was the last time

22:19.539 --> 22:21.007
that Yates and Rudnick
were seen?

22:21.007 --> 22:22.308
- 6:00 a.m. head count.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.544
- Great, so they have
a nine-hour head start,

22:24.544 --> 22:26.446
which means
they could be anywhere.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.114
- You say Rollins
understands him

22:28.114 --> 22:29.982
better than anybody else?

22:29.982 --> 22:32.018
Get her up here.

22:42.462 --> 22:42.595
.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.063
- This just
in on the continuing manhunt

22:45.798 --> 22:47.634
for escaped serial killers
Greg Yates and Carl Rudnick.

22:47.634 --> 22:50.236
Sources now confirm
that two ConElectric workers

22:50.236 --> 22:52.138
were found
murdered this afternoon

22:52.138 --> 22:54.206
just outside
Green Haven Correctional.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.443
The workers are believed
to have assisted the fugitives

22:56.443 --> 22:58.478
in their daring escape
earlier today.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.046
The search for the two
convicted felons

23:00.046 --> 23:02.248
intensifies tonight.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.451
Troopers from four states
and law enforcement personnel

23:04.451 --> 23:07.319
from several federal agencies
have converged on the scene.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.056
Both Yates and Rudnick
were serving life sentences

23:10.056 --> 23:12.058
for multiple counts
of rape and murder.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.461
They should be considered
extremely dangerous.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.363
Officials are cautioning
that anyone who sees them

23:17.363 --> 23:19.699
or has information
on either of the two men

23:19.699 --> 23:22.368
should not attempt
to interact with them.

23:22.368 --> 23:25.104
[dramatic music]

23:25.104 --> 23:27.206
- We think
that they may have made a break

23:27.206 --> 23:30.042
after head count
this morning.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.378
- And no one
noticed for eight hours?

23:32.378 --> 23:34.213
- Oh, it's a long story,
but I am gonna

23:34.213 --> 23:36.148
need all the help
that I can get.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.051
- No problem--I'll tell my guys
to turn around.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.488
- Okay, Voight.
Copy that.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.590
Lindsay and Dawson
were about to board a plane.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.191
They're on their way up now.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.159
- Lieutenant.
You all right?

23:47.159 --> 23:49.361
- Yeah.
Long day.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.297
- No sign of Rudnick or Yates?
- Not yet.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.099
State troopers
set up road blocks.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.501
- So now we know why Yates

23:54.501 --> 23:56.302
asked to be transferred
to Honor Block.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.605
- His cell mate told us that
Rudnick planned the whole thing

23:58.605 --> 24:01.273
and that Yates nosed in
at the last minute.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.075
- Lieutenant,
I did not see this coming.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.711
- Hey, nobody's blaming you.
- No, I mean all of it.

24:04.711 --> 24:07.246
You know, calling in CPD,
getting me involved.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.615
Yates was playing a long game.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.282
He must have figured out
Rudnick's plan

24:10.282 --> 24:12.018
and realized
that the clock was ticking.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.319
- The entire county's
on lockdown.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.554
There's a nationwide
alert.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.422
They won't get away.

24:16.422 --> 24:18.190
- You don't know Yates.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.926
- Yates and Rudnick
are extremely dangerous.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.261
They've already killed two men
who helped them escape.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.163
Major Bowman?
- All right,

24:24.163 --> 24:25.998
they've already a head start,
so they could be anywhere.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.700
We've warned the public
to keep their doors locked

24:27.700 --> 24:30.269
and to avoid
engaging any strangers.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.038
- NYPD's
Special Victims Unit

24:32.038 --> 24:34.206
is here to give specifics
about the fugitives.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.009
Lieutenant Benson?
- These guys are intelligent.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.611
They're motivated.
They're charming,

24:38.611 --> 24:41.147
and they are without conscience.

24:41.147 --> 24:45.017
Their crimes include rape,
kidnapping, torture, and murder.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.587
- Now, Yates is definitely
capable of hot-wiring cars.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.321
He's adept at identity theft,

24:49.321 --> 24:51.257
and he is highly manipulative.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.092
- Especially when preying
on young women.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.327
Now, Rudnick can blend in
with the group.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.463
We know that he assumes
disguises,

24:57.463 --> 24:59.031
usually an older female.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.199
- Thank you, SVU.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.570
To sum up, these men
are dangerous sociopaths

25:03.570 --> 25:05.337
who will not hesitate to kill.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.606
- We've already begun

25:06.606 --> 25:09.308
house-to-house searches
and roadblocks.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.110
Air support with heat sensors

25:11.110 --> 25:13.713
and infrared will be in the air
within the half hour.

25:13.713 --> 25:17.016
Search every inch
of this county.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.088
- My staff has pulled
security cameras,

25:22.088 --> 25:23.590
visitors' logs,
and personnel files.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.291
- Okay, my team
can help with the interviews.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.226
- Hey, how bad are these guys?

25:27.226 --> 25:28.595
- Think Robert Durst
and Ted Bundy

25:28.595 --> 25:31.130
on the run together.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.600
- Okay, those two are crazy,
and they got mad skills.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.835
- Yes,
but they had help, Silva--who?

25:35.835 --> 25:37.036
- Not me.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.671
- They had hacksaws,
paint, drills.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.472
Now, who smuggled it to 'em,
the COs?

25:40.472 --> 25:42.074
- I don't want to say.
I like her.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.442
- You like who?

25:43.442 --> 25:45.244
- Silva, they've already
killed two people!

25:45.244 --> 25:46.312
Talk.
Now.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.680
- Okay.
Mrs. Wilkins.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.682
She teaches our conflict
transformation class.

25:49.682 --> 25:53.219
She was always bringing Dr.
Rudnick lasagna, baked stuff.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.621
He never let me eat any of it.

25:54.621 --> 25:57.423
I think because
there was contraband inside.

25:57.423 --> 26:00.526
- How did they get it
past the COs?

26:00.526 --> 26:02.294
- They like
her lasagna too.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.496
- I didn't know anything
was in that lasagna.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.132
I swear to God.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.867
The tray she gave me
just have sausage inside.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.837
- So she comes in holding
nothing but a tray of lasagna?

26:10.837 --> 26:12.471
- No, she kept them
in a shopping bag.

26:12.471 --> 26:13.840
It was filled with arts
and crafts stuff.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.675
Look,
she had gate clearance.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.110
- Yeah, but still, you put it
through the metal detector,

26:18.110 --> 26:19.511
right?

26:19.511 --> 26:21.447
- She asked if
I could just hand-check it.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.282
She always kept
her lunch in there.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.251
She didn't want it getting
bombarded with those rays.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.653
Those things can cause cancer.

26:26.653 --> 26:29.555
- So you didn't check it at all?

26:31.290 --> 26:34.093
- I need my union rep.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.394
- Bronwyn Wilkins.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.663
She's a nice woman.
She's a Quaker, she--

26:36.663 --> 26:38.364
- Wait,
her first name is Bronwyn?

26:38.364 --> 26:39.565
- Yes.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.433
- Red hair,
heavyset, glasses?

26:41.433 --> 26:43.269
- Yes. She just
got married last month.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.671
Her maiden name was Freed.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.338
- You got to be kidding me.
- You know her?

26:46.338 --> 26:50.142
- Bronwyn Freed helped
William Lewis escape from Rikers

26:50.142 --> 26:52.812
by bringing him drugs
inside baked goods.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.380
- Don't you
do background checks?

26:54.380 --> 26:56.448
- Of course,
but Mrs. Wilkins has no record.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.850
- Because the charges
were dropped.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.819
This is not my call.
- You didn't tell me that.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.321
- Rikers had issues with chain
of custody and corrupt COs,

27:02.321 --> 27:04.190
and no one upstairs wanted
to open up that can of worms.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.159
- Okay, that's fine, but still,
she has to be flagged at Rikers.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.761
- Rikers is city.
We're state.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.496
The two systems don't exactly
communicate very well.

27:10.496 --> 27:14.166
- Okay, you know what?
We need an address.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.567
Now.

27:15.567 --> 27:18.237
[dramatic music]

27:18.237 --> 27:20.406
- We don't know what
we're looking at. Stay sharp.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.374
- Should we wait for infrared?
Will she be armed?

27:22.374 --> 27:23.575
- I don't think so.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.377
She teaches alternatives
to conflict--

27:25.377 --> 27:28.180
bakes muffins and lasagna.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.417
- Let's do this.

27:31.417 --> 27:34.453
- Get down!
- Down, now!

27:34.453 --> 27:36.588
- What's going on?

27:36.588 --> 27:38.190
- Who are you?
Where's Bronwyn?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.326
- I'm Kyle.
I'm--I'm her husband.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.560
- Where's your wife?

27:41.560 --> 27:42.729
- She said
she had a family emergency,

27:42.729 --> 27:44.430
so she took my car.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.733
- All right, make,
model, plate number.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.367
- What's the deal
with this girl?

27:48.367 --> 27:49.736
She got a thing
for serial killers?

27:49.736 --> 27:51.103
- More or less.
- This her car?

27:51.103 --> 27:52.471
- Well, it's the same make
and model as the husband

27:52.471 --> 27:53.906
but different plates.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.775
- Yates would switch 'em.
- No sign of him or Rudnick?

27:55.775 --> 27:57.443
- There was nothing
in the car, but they were here.

27:57.443 --> 27:58.911
The dogs picked up their scent.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.948
- Hey, Lieutenant,
I got something over here!

28:04.216 --> 28:05.752
Come here.

28:05.752 --> 28:08.587
I got a jumpsuit...

28:08.587 --> 28:11.423
a dress, and a wig.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.260
- Okay, so the question
is now where's Rudnick's body?

28:14.260 --> 28:16.528
- Hey, dogs are on to something.

28:16.528 --> 28:20.532
[dogs barking]

28:20.532 --> 28:21.834
- Car's locked, Lieutenant.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.170
- Open it.

28:28.274 --> 28:31.778
- [whimpering]

28:31.778 --> 28:33.379
- Where are they?
Where's Yates?

28:33.379 --> 28:35.081
- I don't know!
Help me, please.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.548
- All right, well,
you were with them.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.917
How long ago?
- Before noon.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.787
He--Yates, he made me--
[crying]

28:40.787 --> 28:42.021
- Get her out of there.

28:47.794 --> 28:47.894
.

28:48.527 --> 28:49.528
- More than a thousand officers
are now on the trail

28:51.263 --> 28:54.934
of the two escaped inmates,
Greg Yates and Carl Rudnick,

28:54.934 --> 28:57.436
who broke out
of Green Haven Correctional

28:57.436 --> 28:59.138
24 hours ago.

28:59.138 --> 29:02.008
The search has spread
to neighboring counties

29:02.008 --> 29:03.943
as local police,
state troopers,

29:03.943 --> 29:07.013
ATF officials, and the
Department of Corrections

29:07.013 --> 29:09.148
conduct road checks,
door-to-door searches,

29:09.148 --> 29:11.350
and full sweeps of the area.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.552
Sources confirm
that the two fugitives

29:13.552 --> 29:15.922
may have been helped
in their escape

29:15.922 --> 29:19.158
from inside the prison
by a female accomplice

29:19.158 --> 29:21.327
who authorities
are questioning now.

29:21.327 --> 29:24.563
[dramatic music]

29:24.563 --> 29:26.866
- I was working with Dr. Rudnick
on his impulse issues.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.267
He's a very sensitive man.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.269
Over time, we grew close.
- How close?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.304
- He was a confidant,
able to read my moods.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.840
Like he'd say,
"You seem like

29:33.840 --> 29:35.041
you're feeling
a little sad today."

29:35.041 --> 29:36.242
- Did he ask you for favors?

29:36.242 --> 29:37.910
- He'd talk about a--a book

29:37.910 --> 29:39.611
he missed,
a piece of art or music.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.247
He loves Albinoni,
the "Adagio in--"

29:41.247 --> 29:43.215
- So you brought him gifts.
- Little things.

29:43.215 --> 29:45.651
Salt to cook with,
spices, organic soaps.

29:45.651 --> 29:47.119
- How about hacksaws?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.687
- Maybe it's not good
for her to be here.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.022
She has a lot
of anger toward me.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.958
- Yeah, why do you think
that is, Bronwyn?

29:51.958 --> 29:54.861
- Liv, we got this.
- No, I'm not gonna coddle her.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.964
You helped two serial killers
escape from prison.

29:57.964 --> 30:01.267
Whatever they do to anyone
while they're out is on you.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.335
- Dr. Rudnick has dealt
with his dark side.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.271
- He chopped a woman
into little pieces!

30:05.271 --> 30:06.873
- That's not the man
that I know.

30:06.873 --> 30:08.507
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, Bronwyn.

30:08.507 --> 30:09.976
I'm sure he--
he can be empathic

30:09.976 --> 30:12.311
and make you feel wanted,
attractive,

30:12.311 --> 30:14.046
but he was using you.

30:14.046 --> 30:17.349
- They left you to die
in the trunk of a car.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.385
He doesn't give
a damn about you.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.587
- Carl does.
He just couldn't survive inside.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.022
- You helped them escape?

30:23.022 --> 30:24.991
You're looking
at felony charges.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.558
You need to tell us
what you brought them,

30:26.558 --> 30:29.528
what their plans are,
everything.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.232
- Just got a still from
the Kingston Rhinecliff Bridge

30:33.232 --> 30:35.834
time-stamped yesterday morning.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.204
- Looks like two church ladies.
- That's Bronwyn.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.671
That's Rudnick.
He's wearing the wig

30:39.671 --> 30:41.007
and the dress
we found near the car.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.875
- Yates was probably hiding
in the back

30:42.875 --> 30:44.610
while they drove upstate.
- That's a smart plan.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.078
Nobody's gonna be looking
for them at that hour,

30:46.078 --> 30:47.746
and even if somebody were,
two women in a Subaru

30:47.746 --> 30:49.115
ain't gonna raise any flags.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.749
- Yeah, once
they get past Albany

30:50.749 --> 30:52.318
in a less trafficked area,
they don't need Bronwyn anymore,

30:52.318 --> 30:55.187
so they dump her in that lot.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.723
- Yates said
I'd served my purpose,

30:57.723 --> 30:59.892
that I didn't need to know
what their next stop was.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.360
- Why didn't he kill you?

31:01.360 --> 31:03.963
- Dr. Rudnick
said he would do it,

31:03.963 --> 31:05.764
but he saved my life.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.199
Just fired a shot

31:07.199 --> 31:09.001
and threw me in the trunk
of the other car.

31:09.001 --> 31:11.337
- A shot? They're armed?
- My husband keeps an old .38

31:11.337 --> 31:12.939
in case the bears
get into the garbage.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.740
They made me bring it along.
- They made you?

31:14.740 --> 31:17.944
- Yes.
I was in fear for my life.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.946
- Where were they going?

31:19.946 --> 31:21.380
- Benson says Bronwyn
gave Rudnick

31:21.380 --> 31:23.815
a gun and a map
of the Adirondack State Park.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.085
- Adirondack Park?
That's 6 million acres.

31:26.085 --> 31:27.786
- Yeah, that's why we need
to look in the north end.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.255
When Rollins
and I apprehended Rudnick,

31:29.255 --> 31:31.090
he was in Buffalo, just shy
of the Canadian border.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.259
- What was his escape plan?
- He had a passport and cash,

31:33.259 --> 31:34.961
but beyond that,
we never found out.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.028
- That's Rudnick, but Yates?

31:36.028 --> 31:37.296
The last time he was on the run

31:37.296 --> 31:39.165
he killed Nadia
and he went on a spree.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.967
- Yeah, we're not even sure
if these two are still together.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.201
I mean, there's bad blood
between the two of 'em.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.669
- Yeah, well,
anything is possible.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.171
They could have split up.
One could've killed the other.

31:45.171 --> 31:46.438
- We had some more sightings.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.474
- How many?
- Too many.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.142
All over the county, the state,

31:50.142 --> 31:52.244
as far south
as the Texas-Mexico border.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.246
- Any sightings
on the way up to Canada?

31:54.246 --> 31:55.982
- Yates manipulated me.

31:55.982 --> 31:57.984
He figured out that Dr. Rudnick
and I were intimate.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.118
- Physically?

31:59.118 --> 32:00.352
- No, of course not,
but spiritually.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.988
- How did he manipulate you?

32:01.988 --> 32:03.355
- He found out
about the lasagna.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.991
- So you told him Rudnick
was planning an escape.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.358
- I had to.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.659
He said that if I didn't,
he'd kill my husband.

32:07.659 --> 32:10.196
- Yates was in prison.
Your husband was 30 miles away.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.131
- That doesn't matter.

32:12.131 --> 32:15.767
If Yates wants to hurt somebody,
he finds a way.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.770
[dramatic music]

32:18.770 --> 32:21.707
*

32:21.707 --> 32:24.643
[police radio chatter]

32:24.643 --> 32:27.079
- Son of a bitch.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.215
- You okay?

32:29.215 --> 32:31.217
- This is Yates.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.019
- They found
prison-issued underwear.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.520
They're checking for DNA.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.755
- It's Yates.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.324
How'd the trooper
end up here?

32:38.324 --> 32:39.858
- First responder got a call
from a neighbor

32:39.858 --> 32:41.460
who saw smoke coming
out of the chimney.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.095
The owner never
stays here in winter.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.430
- How long ago?
- An hour.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.865
They also found
a blood trail outside.

32:46.865 --> 32:49.035
One of 'em may be hurt.
Might have slowed 'em down.

32:49.035 --> 32:51.237
Dogs are on both scents.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.405
[background chatter]

33:00.346 --> 33:02.248
- Hey.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.186
We'll get 'em.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.523
- Yates's trail
ends at the water.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.525
You got any boats
out this time of year?

33:13.525 --> 33:15.061
- There shouldn't be.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.462
We got one of ours
out there looking now.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.397
Customs and Border
got divers in the lake.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.799
- Any year-rounders out here?
- It's mostly summer cabins.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.501
We got infrared.
We're checking indoors.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.636
- The dogs picked up
Rudnick's scent.

33:29.075 --> 33:31.543
Look, he's barely moving
or even breathing.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.080
- This is the state police!

33:34.080 --> 33:36.948
Come out slowly
with your hands up!

33:36.948 --> 33:39.118
[weapons clicking]

33:41.187 --> 33:43.455
- All right, look, he is trying
to get up, but he can't.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.224
- That piece of crap
already got one of ours.

33:45.224 --> 33:46.392
I'm not risking these guys.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.094
Fire into the boat!

33:48.094 --> 33:49.595
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on--do not shoot!

33:49.595 --> 33:51.130
I know this man.
- Detective--

33:51.130 --> 33:52.998
- We've got history.
- No, we got it.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.466
We got it.
We got it.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.569
- Dr. Rudnick,
it's Detective Carisi.

33:57.569 --> 34:00.372
I saw you on the infrared.
Can you hear me?

34:00.372 --> 34:03.475
All right, I'm walking
towards the boat.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.477
I want you to live tonight!

34:05.477 --> 34:08.280
Isn't that what you want?

34:08.280 --> 34:11.217
All right, you're gonna put
your hands high above your head.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.152
All right, nice and easy, Doc.

34:13.152 --> 34:17.356
[tense music]

34:17.356 --> 34:19.158
[slices]

34:21.026 --> 34:22.361
Do not move.

34:22.361 --> 34:24.730
- [labored breathing]

34:24.730 --> 34:26.165
- All right, I need some help
over here!

34:26.165 --> 34:27.599
An ambulance, ASAP!

34:27.599 --> 34:30.936
- Let's get some help over here.
We need a bus.

34:30.936 --> 34:33.139
- Thank you, Detective.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.407
- All right, just stay with me,
Dr. Rudnick.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.743
- [thready breathing]

34:42.148 --> 34:42.248
.

34:43.849 --> 34:44.983
- Breaking news in the manhunt
for the two escaped inmates

34:46.218 --> 34:48.053
from Green Haven Correctional.

34:48.053 --> 34:49.555
Officials have confirmed

34:49.555 --> 34:51.623
that Carl Rudnick
has been apprehended.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.326
He is now in police custody
after he was discovered hiding

34:54.326 --> 34:56.828
in a docked boat
by Caroga Lake.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.697
Rudnick
suffered multiple injuries.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.299
He was rushed
to the nearest hospital

35:00.299 --> 35:02.301
where he is now
being questioned.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.470
And the scale of the search
is widening

35:04.470 --> 35:06.338
for the second fugitive,
Greg Yates,

35:06.338 --> 35:08.707
who remains at large
amidst reports of sightings

35:08.707 --> 35:11.410
from as far apart
as the Adirondacks

35:11.410 --> 35:13.245
to the Mexican border.

35:13.245 --> 35:16.248
We will keep you updated
as this story continues.

35:18.184 --> 35:19.285
- Yates hobbled him.

35:19.285 --> 35:20.919
He broke both his knees,
his ankles,

35:20.919 --> 35:22.421
pierced his eardrum.
Just left him to die.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.423
- I'm not shedding any tears.
- Yeah.

35:24.423 --> 35:25.624
Is he talking yet?
- Only to Carisi,

35:25.624 --> 35:26.792
and he's in and out
of consciousness.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.227
- He did indicate
the plan was to

35:28.227 --> 35:30.028
cross the border
at the Saint Lawrence River.

35:30.028 --> 35:31.397
- Lieutenant,
I'm glad you're here.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.031
I can't get a hold
of Lindsay.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.400
- I thought she was
with you or Dodds.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.501
- No. We split up.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.203
I followed one dead end.
They followed another.

35:37.203 --> 35:38.737
Did Lindsay know Yates
was headed north?

35:38.737 --> 35:40.372
- I guess--we put an APB out
on a pickup truck he hot-wired.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.208
- She's going after him.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.276
- Look, Dodds wouldn't let her
go up there alone.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.311
Look, call him.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.379
Get 'em back.
- Yeah.

35:47.379 --> 35:48.647
- Oh, I assure you,
Detective,

35:48.647 --> 35:50.816
it was never my intent
to harm anyone.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.452
Yates simply bulldozed
his way in.

35:53.452 --> 35:57.589
I wanted to leave the country
and live a life of peace.

35:57.589 --> 36:00.626
He only wants one thing...

36:00.626 --> 36:02.494
revenge.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.432
- Okay, Doc, you got a lot
of meds in you right now.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.767
I want you to stay with me.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.502
Your plan.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.771
Where on the Saint Lawrence
River were you going?

36:12.771 --> 36:15.140
- Wellesley Island.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.376
Though I suppose
I won't be going there now.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.144
- And Yates knew about this?

36:19.144 --> 36:21.079
- He beat it out of me.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.317
- Wellesley Island.
- I'll get the word out.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.118
- It's Dodds.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.621
- Dodds, Border Patrol
and ATF are handling.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.723
Come back now.
- Copy that, Lieutenant.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.593
All the agencies are on it.
They'll find him.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.662
My lieutenant
wants us to come back.

36:36.662 --> 36:38.430
- Yeah, I'm not doing that.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.333
I'll drop you
at a rest stop if you want.

36:41.333 --> 36:44.403
- Detective, I know
he killed someone close to you,

36:44.403 --> 36:47.673
but this isn't us anymore.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.375
- What the hell is that?

36:51.042 --> 36:52.311
- There's been no radio traffic.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.812
Pull over.

County Road 3.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.507
Six miles west of Plessis.

37:21.507 --> 37:24.376

[tense music]

37:30.582 --> 37:37.723

37:37.723 --> 37:40.659
I got a trooper down.

He's gone.
