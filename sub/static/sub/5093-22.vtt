WEBVTT

00:09.206 --> 00:11.274
Oh, man.

00:11.276 --> 00:13.359
This is it, Reagan.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.528
Welcome to the end.

00:15.530 --> 00:17.079
The end?

00:17.081 --> 00:19.031
The Bitterman Houses,
aka The Bitter End.

00:19.033 --> 00:21.117
That's right. I forgot,
you grew up here.

00:21.119 --> 00:23.786
Yeah, I did 18 years
in that building right there.

00:23.788 --> 00:26.539
Yeah, you say it like
it was a sentence.

00:26.541 --> 00:29.759
Living under gang rule,
it was, and it still is.

00:29.761 --> 00:31.577
Excuse me. We got a report
of a woman and her infant

00:31.579 --> 00:33.095
in distress. You guys heard
anything like that?

00:33.097 --> 00:35.097
Anybody call 911?

00:37.017 --> 00:38.634
Must be part of your
homecoming committee.

00:38.636 --> 00:40.102
They're not gonna
tell you nothing.

00:40.104 --> 00:41.637
Not while you're in the bag.

00:41.639 --> 00:43.088
I don't buy that.
There's good people here.

00:43.090 --> 00:44.357
They can't all
be afraid of cops.

00:44.359 --> 00:45.775
Well, they're not
afraid of cops.

00:45.777 --> 00:46.976
They're afraid
of Los Lordes.

00:46.978 --> 00:48.528
And as long as
this is their turf,

00:48.530 --> 00:49.729
everybody keeps
their mouths shut.

00:49.731 --> 00:51.398
Or else, huh?

00:51.400 --> 00:52.532
Damn straight.

00:52.534 --> 00:54.734
Well, then, it looks
like we're on our own.

00:54.736 --> 00:55.835
You got that right.

00:55.837 --> 00:57.170
Let's start with
your building.

00:57.172 --> 00:59.906
Caller said it sounded
like she was on the roof.

00:59.908 --> 01:02.075
Yeah, home, sweet home.

01:05.746 --> 01:07.380
Some luck
we're having tonight, Cruz.

01:07.382 --> 01:10.750
No one will talk to us,
and the elevators are broken.

01:10.752 --> 01:12.452
Welcome to the Bitter End.

01:12.454 --> 01:13.820
I hate working midnights.

01:13.822 --> 01:15.488
Shh. You hear that?

01:17.826 --> 01:20.560
Come on.

01:20.562 --> 01:22.228
Now, I'm gonna
give you...

01:24.166 --> 01:25.498
Hey, knock it off.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.933
Hey, come on, back up.
What? We ain't doing nothing!

01:26.935 --> 01:28.168
Back up.
We ain't doin' nothin'!

01:28.170 --> 01:30.170
Yeah, he just pulled
his own pants down?

01:30.172 --> 01:31.471
Come on.

01:31.473 --> 01:33.573
We're just messing
with him, all right?

01:33.575 --> 01:36.142
Plus, he likes it.

01:36.144 --> 01:37.544
Are you okay, buddy?

01:37.546 --> 01:40.080
Yeah, I... I'm okay.

01:40.082 --> 01:43.183
Hector? Is that you?

01:43.185 --> 01:46.352
You don't
remember me, do you?

01:46.354 --> 01:48.688
I used to baby-sit you.
My name is Vinny Cruz.

01:48.690 --> 01:50.123
Skinny Vinny.

01:50.125 --> 01:52.325
Yeah, that's right,
Skinny Vinny.

01:52.327 --> 01:54.160
You do remember.

01:54.162 --> 01:55.962
Are you okay?

01:55.964 --> 01:57.497
These guys didn't hurt you?

01:57.499 --> 01:59.566
No. They were just
joking around.

01:59.568 --> 02:00.967
You see? Told you.

02:00.969 --> 02:02.869
Talking to him.

02:02.871 --> 02:04.704
Reagan, watch 'em.

02:04.706 --> 02:07.073
Okay, do me a favor, Hector--
why don't you head home, okay?

02:07.075 --> 02:08.441
Say hi to your mom for me.

02:08.443 --> 02:10.676
Thanks, Skinny Vinny.
All right.

02:15.149 --> 02:16.699
All right, step aside.
Show's over.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.902
<i>Yo no hablo ingles, po-po.</i>

02:20.655 --> 02:21.538
Yeah, or else what?

02:21.540 --> 02:22.956
Back up.

02:22.958 --> 02:24.357
Hey, look, I'm not gonna
say it again, all right?

02:24.359 --> 02:25.742
Step aside.

02:25.744 --> 02:26.743
Right now.

02:26.745 --> 02:28.628
Here's the thing you best start

02:28.630 --> 02:30.747
to understand--
in the Bitter End,

02:30.749 --> 02:32.582
Los Lordes makes the move.

02:32.584 --> 02:34.667
Not no Five-Oh.

02:34.669 --> 02:35.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:35.870 --> 02:38.805
How's that for a move? Huh?
Back up!

02:38.807 --> 02:40.723
Look, we got a job to do,
and you're obstructing.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.058
So get a move on!

02:45.429 --> 02:47.097
Don't even
think about it.

02:48.549 --> 02:50.683
Yeah, I'm watching you.

02:55.489 --> 02:57.407
That was a close one, Reagan.

02:57.409 --> 02:59.659
Come on,
let's keep going.

03:04.748 --> 03:07.417
Excuse me, Miss Erin.
Valerie.

03:07.419 --> 03:09.936
I thought I wasn't gonna see you
until tomorrow's trial.

03:12.623 --> 03:15.258
Come. Sit.

03:17.878 --> 03:20.847
I am sorry, Miss Erin.

03:20.849 --> 03:24.350
You're not going to testify.

03:24.352 --> 03:27.270
I can't. I want to, but...

03:27.272 --> 03:29.055
muy peligrioso.

03:29.057 --> 03:30.890
Has someone threatened you?

03:30.892 --> 03:33.193
They haven't said a word,

03:33.195 --> 03:35.395
but you get the message.

03:35.397 --> 03:37.313
I understand.

03:37.315 --> 03:39.949
If you think it's
unsafe to testify,

03:39.951 --> 03:42.235
then, by all means,
you shouldn't.

03:42.237 --> 03:45.705
I know all too well how gangs
like Los Lordes operate.

03:45.707 --> 03:46.956
Thank you.

03:46.958 --> 03:49.025
But you need to know that,

03:49.027 --> 03:52.612
without your testimony,
my hands are tied.

03:52.614 --> 03:55.915
My boss won't let me
try the case.

03:55.917 --> 03:59.719
Which means... the men
who mugged you will be released.

03:59.721 --> 04:01.754
You have my card.

04:01.756 --> 04:04.140
If you need anything,

04:04.142 --> 04:06.792
or if you're threatened,
or your grandson is threatened,

04:06.794 --> 04:09.846
you need to call me immediately.

04:09.848 --> 04:13.132
Thank you, Miss Erin.

04:24.195 --> 04:25.912
Oh.

04:25.914 --> 04:28.665
What's up, Dad?

04:28.667 --> 04:31.501
I was looking
for an explanation,

04:31.503 --> 04:34.454
and I hoped you could help.

04:36.290 --> 04:38.341
The People decline to prosecute.

04:38.343 --> 04:41.261
Get out of jail free cards.

04:41.263 --> 04:45.098
The DA has been dealing these
like it's a game of gin rummy...

04:45.100 --> 04:46.466
Dad...
...and a lot of solid

04:46.468 --> 04:49.102
arrests are being dismissed
because your boss,

04:49.104 --> 04:52.972
this office,
refuses to try good cases.

04:52.974 --> 04:55.024
It's a complicated issue.

04:55.026 --> 04:56.759
Doing the right thing
may be hard,

04:56.761 --> 04:59.345
but it sure as hell
ain't complicated.

05:07.205 --> 05:09.239
All right.
Go.

05:09.241 --> 05:11.541
Hey, police!

05:11.543 --> 05:13.042
Anybody out here?

05:13.044 --> 05:14.327
Hey...

05:14.329 --> 05:15.578
Don't come any closer.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.497
Ma'am, we don't
want to hurt you.

05:17.499 --> 05:19.132
Go away!

05:19.134 --> 05:21.217
What's your name, ma'am?

05:21.219 --> 05:22.702
What do you care?

05:22.704 --> 05:23.920
Listen,
my name is Jamie.

05:23.922 --> 05:25.221
This is my partner Vinny.

05:25.223 --> 05:27.056
Hey.
What's your name?

05:27.058 --> 05:28.508
Noni.

05:28.510 --> 05:29.726
Okay.

05:29.728 --> 05:32.228
Well, who's that
you're holding?

05:32.230 --> 05:33.313
What's your baby's name?

05:33.315 --> 05:35.398
Anthony.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.766
Okay, Noni.

05:36.768 --> 05:38.651
Why don't you and Anthony
come a little bit closer,

05:38.653 --> 05:39.936
and we'll just
talk for a minute?

05:39.938 --> 05:42.772
Got nothing to talk about.
It's over.

05:42.774 --> 05:44.357
What's over, Noni?

05:44.359 --> 05:45.725
Someone you had
a fight with?

05:45.727 --> 05:47.410
Your husband,
or your boyfriend?

05:47.412 --> 05:48.861
Ain't no fight.

05:48.863 --> 05:51.080
The game <i>is</i> what the game <i>is.</i>

05:51.082 --> 05:52.749
And ain't nothing gonna change.

05:52.751 --> 05:56.085
Okay, his...
his father's in the game, huh?

05:56.087 --> 05:58.254
He's Los Lordes?

05:59.373 --> 06:02.908
Which makes Anthony Los Lordes.

06:02.910 --> 06:05.211
You born in it,
you die in it.

06:05.213 --> 06:08.264
I'm not gonna let my baby grow
into a monster.

06:08.266 --> 06:09.465
No, you don't...

06:09.467 --> 06:11.301
You don't have to, okay?
Look, Noni,

06:11.303 --> 06:13.519
I grew up here, okay?
I know how you're feeling.

06:13.521 --> 06:16.222
Cop don't know nothing
about how I'm feeling.

06:16.224 --> 06:18.641
Hey, listen,
we want to help you, okay?

06:18.643 --> 06:21.277
We can take you
and Anthony out of here.

06:21.279 --> 06:22.812
There's no getting out.

06:22.814 --> 06:24.147
His daddy won't let us.

06:24.149 --> 06:26.399
We leave, and he comes
hunting us like a dog.

06:26.401 --> 06:28.117
No, that's not gonna happen.
Yeah.

06:28.119 --> 06:29.535
Yeah, it do happen.

06:29.537 --> 06:31.070
Not this time.

06:31.072 --> 06:33.773
This time,
we're getting out for good.

06:33.775 --> 06:34.824
Noni...

06:36.477 --> 06:37.410
No... no, Noni!

I wish I'd never
taken the cop test.

07:21.464 --> 07:22.631
Yeah, me, too.

It's gonna be

Can you give me a second
with my brother?

07:35.945 --> 07:37.111
How you doing?

07:37.113 --> 07:39.580
Hey. Pretty good, considering.

07:39.582 --> 07:41.699
Look, everything's
swirling around

07:41.701 --> 07:44.818
in your head right now--
the hurt, the anger, the shock.

07:44.820 --> 07:46.871
It's all normal, all right?

07:46.873 --> 07:48.756
If you were okay after seeing
something like that,

07:48.758 --> 07:49.957
that wouldn't be normal.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.509
Yeah. Thanks, Danny.

07:51.511 --> 07:53.127
How's your partner holding up?

07:53.129 --> 07:55.680
He's holding up.
Yeah?

07:55.682 --> 07:57.715
You two lean
on each other, okay?

07:57.717 --> 07:59.851
That's how you get through this.

07:59.853 --> 08:01.969
Okay.

08:01.971 --> 08:03.187
I'll catch up with you.

08:03.189 --> 08:05.172
Thanks, Danny.

08:25.711 --> 08:27.745
Hey.
Detective.

08:27.747 --> 08:29.497
How you holding up?

08:29.499 --> 08:31.532
I'm alive.
Yeah?

08:31.534 --> 08:32.750
You're from around
here, right?

08:32.751 --> 08:34.368
Yeah.
What are you looking at?

08:34.370 --> 08:36.470
What you're gonna find is,
the gang that runs this place--

08:36.472 --> 08:38.222
they got a mute button they can push.
Yeah?

08:38.224 --> 08:40.308
What do they
call themselves?

08:40.309 --> 08:41.676
Los Lordes.

08:42.395 --> 08:43.260
Get out...!

08:43.263 --> 08:44.812
Get out, Five-Oh!

08:44.814 --> 08:47.598
Oh!
Come on. You all right?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.216
Yeah.

08:54.656 --> 08:56.991
Who the hell is that?
Santana.

08:56.993 --> 08:59.360
That's the leader of the
Lordes right there.

08:59.362 --> 09:00.828
It's the head
of the snake.

09:00.830 --> 09:02.163
What's he doing?

09:02.165 --> 09:03.998
Showing us who's boss.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.567
It's all right.

09:06.569 --> 09:08.068
Okay.

09:08.070 --> 09:09.203
You all right?

09:09.205 --> 09:11.372
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:17.429 --> 09:19.964
Morning, Francis.

09:22.018 --> 09:23.917
You didn't sleep well?

09:23.919 --> 09:26.053
Not after a young
woman with her baby

09:26.055 --> 09:29.640
stepped off a
building in my city.

09:29.642 --> 09:31.225
Me, either.

09:35.731 --> 09:38.950
There's no easy solution
to projects like Bitterman.

09:38.952 --> 09:40.818
I'm not looking for easy, Pop.

09:40.820 --> 09:43.671
We're talking
about generations of bad blood

09:43.673 --> 09:45.773
between the community
and the NYPD.

09:45.775 --> 09:48.326
And generations on both sides
who have used that

09:48.328 --> 09:51.979
as an excuse to let it fester,
instead of taking action.

09:51.981 --> 09:53.364
But what action?

09:53.366 --> 09:56.751
Cops aren't missionaries;
they're cops.

09:59.255 --> 10:01.255
Ah.

10:01.257 --> 10:03.341
Have you talked to Jamie?

10:04.926 --> 10:06.677
He'll be fine.

10:17.639 --> 10:20.358
I'll let you two have the room.

10:21.976 --> 10:23.911
I don't want to fight with you,

10:23.913 --> 10:26.247
but I do want you
to hear the other side.

10:26.249 --> 10:27.848
The other side of right
is wrong.

10:27.850 --> 10:32.203
While I don't entirely agree
with my boss's policy,

10:32.205 --> 10:36.007
I do recognize that it addresses
certain realities.

10:36.009 --> 10:37.675
Like telling poor people
that crimes against them

10:37.677 --> 10:39.627
don't matter as much
as crimes against the rich?

10:39.629 --> 10:42.179
The policy does not target
poor people.

10:42.181 --> 10:43.330
Oh, the hell it doesn't!

10:43.332 --> 10:44.832
Dad, we have finite resources.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.802
If we try to win every case,
we're gonna lose all of 'em.

10:47.804 --> 10:49.387
This isn't about keeping score.
No, it's not!

10:49.389 --> 10:51.939
It's about doing the best we can
with what we have.

10:51.941 --> 10:53.891
And if a victim
refuses to testify,

10:53.893 --> 10:55.726
then we don't stand a chance
in court.

10:55.728 --> 10:57.445
And if they do testify,
they don't have a chance

10:57.447 --> 10:59.030
on the street.

11:03.035 --> 11:04.819
What?

11:04.821 --> 11:08.021
I just realized what I said.

11:15.964 --> 11:17.882
Oh, look at you, Reagan.

11:17.884 --> 11:19.050
With a head as hard as yours,

11:19.052 --> 11:21.168
I'm surprised that bottle
even broke the skin.

11:21.170 --> 11:22.503
Funny. Thanks.

11:22.505 --> 11:24.638
You asked for everything
we got on the jumper Noni.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.707
That's pretty thick.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.509
Well, with her man
being Los Lordes,

11:28.511 --> 11:30.811
odds are she collected
a little dirt herself.

11:30.813 --> 11:32.646
How much dirt?
Uh, nothing too bad

11:32.648 --> 11:34.849
considering--
a few possession collars,

11:34.851 --> 11:36.684
discon, resisting.

11:36.686 --> 11:38.385
Not exactly
OG material.

11:38.387 --> 11:39.987
Give me one second.

11:42.390 --> 11:43.774
Yeah, Dad.

11:43.776 --> 11:45.392
How's the noggin?
Well, it took a licking

11:45.394 --> 11:46.861
but keeps on ticking.
Anything I should be worried about?

11:46.863 --> 11:49.163
Well, I spoke to Jamie
at the scene,

11:49.165 --> 11:51.832
but, uh, he's all right;
a little shaken up.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.367
I'm not talking about Jamie.

11:53.369 --> 11:54.835
Well, what are you talking
about?

11:54.837 --> 11:55.920
They hit you with a bottle

11:55.922 --> 11:57.455
and you hit back
with a nuclear missile.

11:57.457 --> 11:58.672
Yeah. I'm fine, Dad.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.040
I'm not gonna
take it too personal,

12:00.042 --> 12:01.509
if that's
what you're talking about.

12:01.511 --> 12:02.910
Danny...

12:02.912 --> 12:05.796
everything about this Bitterman
thing, I want it by the book.

12:05.798 --> 12:08.015
It would be a terrible waste

12:08.017 --> 12:10.184
if this tragedy served to make

12:10.186 --> 12:11.936
a bad thing worse in there.

12:11.938 --> 12:14.221
Yeah, yeah. I got it.
Got it, Dad.

12:14.223 --> 12:15.439
Check in on your brother.

12:15.441 --> 12:18.359
Yep. Will do.

12:18.361 --> 12:21.529
Noni and Nona. Son of a bitch.

12:22.364 --> 12:24.315
Baez, do me a favor.

12:24.317 --> 12:26.283
Pull the case file on this.

12:27.819 --> 12:29.820
But Noni wasn't even the perp.

12:29.822 --> 12:31.322
She was just a witness.
Yeah.

12:31.324 --> 12:34.375
But, uh, look whose case it was.

12:35.210 --> 12:36.794
Yours?

12:36.796 --> 12:37.611
Yeah.

12:37.613 --> 12:39.046
A tragic double homicide.

12:39.048 --> 12:43.384
Noni and her sister witnessed
their parents get gunned down.

12:51.459 --> 12:55.429
Noni? That's a very
pretty name, Noni.

12:55.431 --> 12:58.131
Could you tell me
your sister's name?

12:58.133 --> 13:00.518
Nona.
Nona?

13:00.520 --> 13:02.186
Nona, I'm Detective Reagan.

13:02.188 --> 13:04.939
I bet you're pretty scared,
aren't you?

13:04.941 --> 13:07.024
Yeah?

13:07.026 --> 13:09.076
I don't blame you.

13:09.078 --> 13:11.662
You guys want
to see something cool?

13:11.664 --> 13:14.448
This is my detective
shield.

13:14.450 --> 13:16.450
Go ahead.
You can hold onto it.

13:20.655 --> 13:23.624
Now, in most places,
they'd call that a badge.

13:23.626 --> 13:26.093
But in New York,
we call it a shield.

13:26.095 --> 13:27.678
You know why?

13:27.680 --> 13:29.880
Because a shield
is used

13:29.882 --> 13:31.849
to protect people.

13:31.851 --> 13:35.019
And that's my job,
to protect you.

13:36.304 --> 13:39.473
Would you guys like it
if I helped to protect you?

13:40.842 --> 13:42.810
Yeah? Okay.

13:42.812 --> 13:45.863
Well, then that's
what I'll do.

14:05.298 --> 14:06.935
Yeah.
You got something

14:06.936 --> 14:09.519
for us, Sarge?
Yeah, close the door.

14:12.806 --> 14:14.524
The baby's father?

14:14.526 --> 14:16.809
How'd you get this?
Call it an old friend

14:16.811 --> 14:18.528
from my Bitter End days.

14:18.530 --> 14:19.946
I'm surprised
someone came forward.

14:19.948 --> 14:21.698
There's a lot of good people
living there

14:21.700 --> 14:23.983
who'd like nothing more to run
these animals out of town.

14:23.985 --> 14:25.568
They're scared, that's all.

14:25.570 --> 14:26.869
Ricky Krepps.

14:26.871 --> 14:28.071
And guess where he lives.

14:28.073 --> 14:29.872
Bitterman Houses?
Surprise.

14:29.874 --> 14:31.708
Yeah, but I doubt
you're gonna find him there.

14:31.710 --> 14:32.858
Says who?
Says me.

14:32.860 --> 14:35.161
News travels fast at the End.

14:35.163 --> 14:38.364
My guess is he stays underground
until the heat dies down.

14:38.366 --> 14:39.632
Right.

14:39.634 --> 14:41.300
But he pops up to bury his son.

14:41.302 --> 14:43.419
Noni and Anthony's wake
is today.

14:43.421 --> 14:46.055
Even Al Capone
shows up for that, Sarge.

14:46.057 --> 14:48.057
Yeah, maybe, Detective,
but you show up there,

14:48.059 --> 14:50.476
you're gonna be made quicker
than Casper the Ghost.

14:50.478 --> 14:51.844
Yeah, I might.

14:51.846 --> 14:54.847
But my partner won't.

15:01.155 --> 15:04.056
Look, I'm not trying
to single out the DA's Office.

15:04.058 --> 15:07.226
Just about every agency
and department in this city

15:07.228 --> 15:09.278
is complicit
in passing the buck

15:09.280 --> 15:11.864
where the Bitterman Houses
are concerned.

15:11.866 --> 15:13.899
Including this one.

15:14.752 --> 15:16.786
So what do we do?

15:16.788 --> 15:18.087
Take a sledgehammer

15:18.089 --> 15:20.923
to your boss's policy
would be a start.

15:20.925 --> 15:23.593
You're taking this to the mayor.
I am.

15:23.595 --> 15:25.261
You can't.
Why not?

15:25.263 --> 15:28.264
It's everybody's lead st...
Oh, sorry. I'll come back.

15:28.266 --> 15:29.265
No, please.

15:30.184 --> 15:32.468
My daughter was channeling you.

15:32.470 --> 15:34.020
How so?

15:34.022 --> 15:36.522
I told him that he can't
just bulldoze the mayor

15:36.524 --> 15:37.774
about the DA.

15:37.776 --> 15:39.108
Excellent advice.

15:39.110 --> 15:40.926
We need someone just
to whisper in his ear.

15:40.928 --> 15:44.063
Make the mayor think
it's his idea and not yours.

15:44.065 --> 15:46.899
I can count my friends
in City Hall on one hand.

15:47.767 --> 15:49.101
Grace Newhouse.

15:50.103 --> 15:51.604
You two friends?

15:51.606 --> 15:53.573
Friendly.
Good enough.

15:53.575 --> 15:55.992
The Public Advocate
has no sway with the mayor.

15:55.994 --> 15:57.160
This one does.
Yeah, she's raised

15:57.162 --> 15:59.128
a lot of Upper East Side money
for him

15:59.130 --> 16:00.880
and has strong ties in Albany.

16:00.882 --> 16:01.949
I like it a lot.

16:01.974 --> 16:04.290
Well, that's because
great minds think alike.

16:18.982 --> 16:20.149
How you doing in there, Reagan?

16:20.151 --> 16:21.634
I'm great.

16:21.636 --> 16:23.986
Not even slightly
creeped out yet.

16:23.988 --> 16:25.605
You got eyes on Ricky?

16:25.607 --> 16:27.106
Negative unit.

16:27.108 --> 16:28.641
It's packed in here.

16:28.643 --> 16:30.326
I don't see him yet.

16:30.328 --> 16:32.612
I got eyes on the sister Nona.
She's surrounded

16:32.614 --> 16:34.947
by Los Lordes and Santana.

16:34.949 --> 16:36.833
But no sign of Ricky.

16:37.701 --> 16:39.785
Here we go--
she's on the move,

16:39.787 --> 16:40.653
headed your way.

16:40.655 --> 16:42.821
Okay.

16:46.043 --> 16:47.376
Hey.

16:47.378 --> 16:49.378
Look, I'm not here to cause
any trouble, all right?

16:49.380 --> 16:50.847
I just want to talk to you.

16:50.849 --> 16:52.715
Out of my way.
Hey.

16:52.717 --> 16:54.517
Hear me out, all right?

17:00.340 --> 17:02.675
What do you want?
I want your help.

17:02.677 --> 17:04.026
I don't help no Five-Oh.

17:04.028 --> 17:05.778
Look, we're not strangers, okay?

17:05.780 --> 17:07.230
We've met before, Nona.

17:07.232 --> 17:09.448
Ain't never seen you in my life.

17:09.450 --> 17:12.184
It was a long time ago, but
I was with you and your sister

17:12.185 --> 17:14.185
the day your parents passed.

17:14.188 --> 17:17.356
Sorry. I don't remember nothing
about that day.

17:18.575 --> 17:21.694
Do you know what your sister
said right before she jumped?

17:23.497 --> 17:25.298
She said that
her baby's father, Ricky,

17:25.300 --> 17:27.333
was not gonna let her out
of the life.

17:27.335 --> 17:31.420
That she didn't want her baby to
grow up to be like that animal.

17:31.422 --> 17:32.972
Now, I know
he's out there somewhere,

17:32.974 --> 17:36.008
and you may not want to talk
to him about what he said,

17:36.010 --> 17:37.977
but I do.

17:37.979 --> 17:42.098
All I'm asking is that you just
point him out to me, okay?

17:42.933 --> 17:44.267
I told you.

17:44.269 --> 17:45.651
I don't help no cops.

17:45.653 --> 17:47.520
Hey, your sister is dead.

17:47.522 --> 17:49.021
Your nephew is dead.

17:49.023 --> 17:50.823
Don't you think somebody
should answer for that?

17:50.825 --> 17:52.992
Don't you think Ricky
should answer for that?

17:52.994 --> 17:54.443
Anthony is dead
'cause his selfish mother

17:54.445 --> 17:55.894
gave him no choice.

17:55.896 --> 17:58.331
Noni jumped off that building
'cause she was a basket case.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.449
Has been ever since the day
my parents got blasted,

18:00.451 --> 18:03.336
November 7, 2000.

18:03.338 --> 18:06.071
The day you say
you don't remember.

18:06.073 --> 18:07.673
I remember.

18:07.675 --> 18:09.625
I remember everything.

18:09.627 --> 18:13.596
Even the detective who said
he was gonna protect us.

18:19.771 --> 18:21.270
She's on the move, partner.

18:21.272 --> 18:23.439
Are we a go?
Did you get anything?

18:23.441 --> 18:26.392
No. I got nothing.

18:30.647 --> 18:33.065
Hang on. She's with Santana.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.067
And they ain't just friends.

18:35.069 --> 18:36.435
They're friends with benefits.

18:37.287 --> 18:38.988
Hold on. She's his girl?

18:38.990 --> 18:41.307
Affirmative.

18:43.628 --> 18:45.494
What's happening now?

18:45.496 --> 18:48.280
Probably telling him there's
some creep in with the caskets.

18:48.282 --> 18:50.333
I'd get a move on.

18:50.335 --> 18:52.284
I'm way ahead of you, partner.

18:56.890 --> 18:58.123
Wait a minute.
I got him, Reagan.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.142
Santana just found
Ricky for us.

19:00.144 --> 19:01.727
Where is he?

19:01.729 --> 19:05.014
Getting the hell out of here.

19:05.016 --> 19:06.065
I'm on it.

19:06.067 --> 19:08.067
Cops! Cops! You heard?

19:08.069 --> 19:10.102
Five-Oh right behind me!

19:11.571 --> 19:13.322
Move!

19:14.541 --> 19:16.042
Move!

19:17.194 --> 19:18.661
Move it! Move!

19:18.663 --> 19:19.412
Move!

19:19.414 --> 19:20.446
Hey, Danny!

19:20.448 --> 19:22.314
Hey!

19:22.316 --> 19:23.916
Go! Go!

19:26.320 --> 19:28.037
What the hell are you
even doing here, kid?

19:28.039 --> 19:29.755
I thought you might
need some backup.

19:29.757 --> 19:31.090
Well, you thought wrong.

19:35.262 --> 19:37.046
Are you even on duty?

19:37.048 --> 19:39.098
You want me to pull over?
No, I don't want you

19:39.100 --> 19:40.820
to pull over! I want you to stay
on his ass!

19:40.829 --> 19:41.635
Just try doing it
All right then!

19:41.636 --> 19:43.302
<i>without killing anyone.</i>
<i>I'm on it.</i>

19:45.839 --> 19:46.689
Whoa!

19:48.642 --> 19:50.893
Come on.
I got it. I got it.

20:01.071 --> 20:03.322
<i>Cut through the gas station!</i>

20:06.026 --> 20:09.027
<i>Cut him off!</i>
<i>Hit him! Hit him!</i>

20:16.971 --> 20:19.255
Hands behind your back.

20:24.043 --> 20:25.644
You're welcome.
Yeah.

20:25.646 --> 20:27.763
I'll be sure to let
the old man know

20:27.765 --> 20:29.181
you're doing just fine.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.298
When Erin called to
arrange this meeting,

20:44.299 --> 20:45.650
I had to check
my calendar.

20:45.652 --> 20:48.269
I was certain it must
be April Fools' Day.

20:48.271 --> 20:50.404
Well, I appreciate you
making yourself available.

20:50.406 --> 20:52.223
Of course.

20:52.225 --> 20:53.357
Thank you.
Thank you.

20:53.359 --> 20:54.442
I only wish

20:54.444 --> 20:55.760
you'd let me pick the place.

20:55.762 --> 20:57.078
My treat, my choice.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.448
In exchange for...?

21:02.485 --> 21:04.985
Some polish, some savvy,

21:04.987 --> 21:08.122
some of what you were
named for: some grace.

21:08.124 --> 21:09.823
With our mayor?

21:09.825 --> 21:11.175
Yes, with our mayor.

21:11.177 --> 21:12.710
With you

21:12.712 --> 21:15.346
on my side in an issue
that goes to the very core

21:15.348 --> 21:16.797
of the office you hold:

21:16.799 --> 21:18.499
advocating for the public.

21:18.501 --> 21:20.585
That does get lost
in the day-to-day.

21:20.587 --> 21:23.437
A lot of things do...
that shouldn't.

21:24.857 --> 21:28.008
The DA has his reasons
for demanding that arrests

21:28.010 --> 21:30.695
come with the full
cooperation of the victim.

21:30.697 --> 21:31.812
I've heard them all.

21:31.814 --> 21:33.514
They don't add up
to good policy,

21:33.516 --> 21:35.283
just good economics.

21:35.285 --> 21:37.518
And he's not
running a factory.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.787
I agree with you.

21:39.789 --> 21:41.021
You do?

21:41.023 --> 21:42.123
Yes.

21:42.125 --> 21:43.624
But that's a lot
of political capital

21:43.626 --> 21:44.992
you're asking me to spend.

21:44.994 --> 21:48.696
I don't really know
those metrics.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.298
I do.

21:52.368 --> 21:54.085
Is there something I can do

21:54.087 --> 21:56.036
for the Public
Advocate's Office?

21:56.038 --> 21:57.755
Only if...

21:57.757 --> 21:59.090
the public advocate decides

21:59.092 --> 22:01.809
to run for higher office.

22:03.262 --> 22:05.146
Could I count you as a friend?

22:05.148 --> 22:08.382
Do you like to go
midnight bluefishing?

22:08.384 --> 22:09.850
'Cause that's the kind of thing

22:09.852 --> 22:11.435
me and my friends go in for.

22:12.555 --> 22:14.722
I'd heard you're
very good at this.

22:14.724 --> 22:15.740
This what?

22:15.742 --> 22:17.908
It's a bit of a hustle,

22:17.910 --> 22:19.910
this whole
salt-of-the-earth thing.

22:19.912 --> 22:21.061
Maybe. But by now,

22:21.063 --> 22:23.230
me and the hustle
are one and the same.

22:23.232 --> 22:24.699
Let me spell it out for you...

22:24.701 --> 22:26.066
Let me take a whack.

22:26.068 --> 22:28.035
When it's your turn
to run for mayor,

22:28.037 --> 22:29.904
an endorsement in your pocket

22:29.906 --> 22:32.373
from the high-polling
police commissioner

22:32.375 --> 22:34.625
would go a long way.

22:34.627 --> 22:36.910
Before you go any further,
I'd like to remind you

22:36.912 --> 22:38.629
you called looking
for my help,

22:38.631 --> 22:39.964
not the other way around.

22:39.966 --> 22:41.915
Right you are.

22:41.917 --> 22:44.468
Will you help?

22:44.470 --> 22:48.139
I'll consider everything
that's on the table.

22:55.731 --> 22:57.097
How you doing, Ricky?

22:57.099 --> 22:58.449
Bite me.

22:58.451 --> 23:01.101
You may not be know this,

23:01.103 --> 23:02.403
but I'm not exactly known

23:02.405 --> 23:04.372
for being the nicest
guy on the block.

23:04.374 --> 23:05.573
I ain't too friendly myself.

23:05.575 --> 23:06.574
Yeah, I figured that.

23:06.576 --> 23:07.908
I mean, you did walk your girl

23:07.910 --> 23:10.077
and your baby boy
right off the roof a building.

23:10.079 --> 23:11.746
Hey, I ain't got nothing
to do with that.

23:11.748 --> 23:13.881
And you got nothing on me, so what's up?
Well, actually,

23:13.883 --> 23:16.133
I got you for reckless driving,
blowing two stop signs

23:16.135 --> 23:17.418
and resisting arrest.

23:17.420 --> 23:18.619
All right, so give me my DAT

23:18.621 --> 23:20.388
and let me walk
through that door.

23:20.390 --> 23:21.839
You think you're gonna march
a girl and a baby

23:21.841 --> 23:24.592
off the roof of a building
and then just walk out of here

23:24.594 --> 23:25.760
with a desk
appearance ticket?

23:25.762 --> 23:27.228
Noni stepped off
that ledge herself

23:27.230 --> 23:28.596
'cause she whacked in the head.

23:28.598 --> 23:29.630
That ain't on me.

23:29.632 --> 23:30.681
And she was whacked in the head

23:30.683 --> 23:32.433
because she got
involved with you.

23:32.435 --> 23:34.268
And she wanted
out of the life,

23:34.270 --> 23:35.403
but you said no.

23:35.405 --> 23:36.487
That's why she jumped.

23:36.489 --> 23:37.805
So, guess what?

23:37.807 --> 23:39.073
This is on you.

23:39.075 --> 23:40.324
Come on, son.

23:40.326 --> 23:41.942
You really think this is

23:41.944 --> 23:43.977
my first time
in the box with police?

23:43.979 --> 23:46.163
No.
Now, either you

23:46.165 --> 23:48.332
put up and charge
me with something,

23:48.334 --> 23:51.035
or shut up and watch me
walk through that door.

23:51.037 --> 23:53.487
You got me.

23:53.489 --> 23:55.423
You called my bluff.

23:55.425 --> 23:57.925
Well, I guess
we'll get you out of here.

23:57.927 --> 24:00.594
Though you do understand,
if I walk you out

24:00.596 --> 24:01.995
that door, and you leave here,

24:01.997 --> 24:05.499
it will be with the full weight
of the NYPD coming down on you.

24:05.501 --> 24:07.068
And how do you think
your drug business

24:07.070 --> 24:08.502
is gonna work
with 30,000 cops

24:08.504 --> 24:11.188
looking to give you
a colonoscopy, huh?

24:11.190 --> 24:12.356
Hmm?

24:12.358 --> 24:15.008
What do you want?

24:15.010 --> 24:17.177
Well, the way I see it,
you got two choices.

24:17.179 --> 24:19.196
Either you can give me Santana

24:19.198 --> 24:22.066
and the entire Los Lordes
drug operation--

24:22.068 --> 24:23.517
and I mean everything:

24:23.519 --> 24:26.887
stash houses, shipments,
informants, the whole nine...

24:26.889 --> 24:28.038
Or what?

24:28.040 --> 24:30.458
Or we can begin the rectal exam.

24:30.460 --> 24:33.010
And I'm not gonna stop
till I get to your tonsils.

24:33.012 --> 24:34.245
And then I'll pin 20 on you.

24:34.247 --> 24:35.696
I'd rather take 20 from you

24:35.698 --> 24:38.416
than a death sentence
from Santana all day long.

24:38.418 --> 24:40.668
Okay.

24:45.206 --> 24:47.091
By the way...

24:48.009 --> 24:50.227
...this

24:50.229 --> 24:51.979
is the last thing your baby

24:51.981 --> 24:53.898
left on this earth.

24:58.153 --> 24:59.236
Now, you can stay quiet

24:59.238 --> 25:02.656
and nothing changes
in the Bitter End.

25:04.493 --> 25:07.027
Or you can
cooperate, Ricky.

25:07.029 --> 25:09.697
And maybe, just maybe,

25:09.699 --> 25:11.532
that would mean
that your baby boy,

25:11.534 --> 25:14.418
he didn't die for nothing.

25:42.464 --> 25:43.864
Frank, I appreciate
your concerns,

25:43.866 --> 25:46.116
but the district attorney
does not work for me.

25:46.118 --> 25:48.068
He does listen to you.

25:48.070 --> 25:49.820
About as much as you do.

25:49.822 --> 25:52.773
Mr. Mayor, if you came to me

25:52.775 --> 25:53.958
with a matter this important,

25:53.960 --> 25:56.377
you know I'd do a hell
of a lot more

25:56.379 --> 25:57.545
than just listen.

25:57.547 --> 26:00.047
Frank, I cannot speak up
every time I disagree

26:00.049 --> 26:02.132
with an elected official's
position on an issue.

26:02.134 --> 26:05.419
What is happening
at the Bitterman Houses

26:05.421 --> 26:07.004
has gone on long enough.

26:07.006 --> 26:10.057
Overturning this policy

26:10.059 --> 26:11.792
will signal to that community

26:11.794 --> 26:14.228
that you're taking the first
step in the right direction.

26:14.230 --> 26:15.629
And I'm quite sure
the district attorney

26:15.631 --> 26:18.098
has a very good reason for
implementing this policy.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.850
Oh, sure he does--
a higher winning percentage

26:19.852 --> 26:21.468
would be good for his career.

26:21.470 --> 26:22.853
Okay, Frank, listen to me...
No.

26:22.855 --> 26:23.904
Please.

26:25.574 --> 26:26.941
Please.

26:26.943 --> 26:30.911
At least talk to some
of the people in your circle.

26:30.913 --> 26:32.813
I have.

26:32.815 --> 26:35.666
Even our own public advocate
agrees with me.

26:39.153 --> 26:41.589
So you've spoken
to Grace Newhouse?

26:42.991 --> 26:45.676
She was here first thing
this morning, Frank.

27:00.191 --> 27:01.842
Can't you just drink coffee

27:01.844 --> 27:03.644
like a normal person?

27:03.646 --> 27:05.145
Normal's overrated.

27:05.147 --> 27:06.146
So is coffee.

27:06.148 --> 27:08.962
That stuff has ox bile in it,
do you know that?

27:08.963 --> 27:10.536
You're supposed
to be watching the door,

27:10.537 --> 27:11.785
not watching me.

27:11.787 --> 27:13.070
I've been watching.

27:13.072 --> 27:15.188
There's nothing but dirtbags
walking into a bar.

27:15.190 --> 27:16.490
Yeah, well, they're
selling a lot more

27:16.492 --> 27:17.691
than booze in that bar.

27:17.693 --> 27:19.710
Santana runs his whole
operation out of that place.

27:19.712 --> 27:20.911
We keep watching,

27:20.913 --> 27:23.130
we'll see
something unusual.

27:23.132 --> 27:24.698
Wait a second...

27:24.700 --> 27:25.966
Look who's coming out.

27:25.968 --> 27:29.369
Yeah, and what's she
carrying in that bag?

27:29.371 --> 27:32.006
That's Santana's car.

27:32.008 --> 27:33.874
Maybe's she's going
to make a drop.

27:33.876 --> 27:35.426
Or she's going to the gym.

27:38.113 --> 27:40.147
Let's find out.

28:14.382 --> 28:16.600
♪

28:29.114 --> 28:30.614
Son of a bitch.

28:30.616 --> 28:31.982
We've been set up.

28:31.984 --> 28:33.901
Yeah, we have.

28:33.903 --> 28:37.237
Damn it.

28:37.239 --> 28:39.456
That's far enough.

28:39.458 --> 28:41.875
I said it's far enough!

28:41.877 --> 28:43.494
Hang back, partner.

28:45.046 --> 28:47.081
It's funny running into you
here, detectives.

28:47.083 --> 28:48.782
What, this supposed to scare me?

28:48.784 --> 28:50.300
Hmm?

28:50.302 --> 28:52.452
Not at all,
Detective Reagan.

28:52.454 --> 28:53.921
It's meant to educate you.
Oh.

28:53.923 --> 28:57.141
So, you want I should
take out my notebook and pencil?

28:57.143 --> 28:59.677
No, better you commit
this to memory.

28:59.679 --> 29:02.146
Los Lordes, we run things
around here in the Bitter End.

29:02.148 --> 29:04.481
That's the way it is,
that's the way it's been,

29:04.483 --> 29:06.233
and that's the way
it's gonna stay.

29:09.971 --> 29:11.271
Well...

29:11.273 --> 29:13.157
I got some bad news for you.

29:13.159 --> 29:14.742
The times they
are a-changing.

29:14.744 --> 29:16.243
Well, if you insist,
Detective,

29:16.245 --> 29:18.862
but you and I both know
how hard change can be...

29:18.864 --> 29:19.980
on everyone.

29:19.982 --> 29:21.198
You're threatening me?

29:21.200 --> 29:22.666
No,I'm appealing
to your better senses.

29:22.668 --> 29:23.751
Oh.

29:23.753 --> 29:25.869
Look, you hate Los Lordes
for what we do.

29:25.871 --> 29:27.788
You ever consider
what we don't do?

29:27.790 --> 29:30.340
I know you don't do
anything worth a damn.

29:30.342 --> 29:32.826
Ours is a growth industry.

29:32.828 --> 29:34.995
But do you see us expanding

29:34.997 --> 29:36.597
into other territories?

29:36.599 --> 29:38.549
No.

29:38.551 --> 29:41.685
We restrict our business
to the Bitter End.

29:41.687 --> 29:45.305
All right, and it's not because
we don't see those other opportunities.

29:45.307 --> 29:47.307
Because we're not greedy.

29:47.309 --> 29:49.443
'Cause we're not stupid.

29:49.445 --> 29:51.645
And because we respect the NYPD.

29:52.981 --> 29:54.114
See, and all we're asking for

29:54.116 --> 29:55.849
in return is that
you do the same.

29:55.851 --> 29:59.119
I could do a lot of
things to you, Santana.

29:59.121 --> 30:02.372
Respecting you--
it's not on the list.

30:02.374 --> 30:03.957
So, it's war that you want?

30:03.959 --> 30:05.075
No.

30:05.077 --> 30:07.027
I want peace for
the good people

30:07.029 --> 30:08.746
of the Bitterman Houses.

30:08.748 --> 30:12.633
If I got to step on your throat
to get that peace, so be it.

30:12.635 --> 30:14.802
Last warning, Detective.

30:15.587 --> 30:17.638
You need to back off.

30:17.640 --> 30:20.007
Backing off is not in my nature.

30:20.009 --> 30:22.042
Final answer.

30:22.044 --> 30:24.928
Then war it is.

31:02.312 --> 31:04.230
I swear to God, Mom, it's true.

31:04.232 --> 31:06.516
Wait-- can you
not swear to God

31:06.518 --> 31:08.851
when we're talking
about a priest, please?

31:08.853 --> 31:10.686
Is that right?

31:10.688 --> 31:12.955
I don't know, actually,
but it sounds right.

31:12.957 --> 31:14.941
I've been keeping
score in my head.

31:14.943 --> 31:16.142
Every Sunday
since Christmas,

31:16.144 --> 31:17.326
when I started,

31:17.328 --> 31:19.529
the homily boils down
to one sentence--

31:19.531 --> 31:21.897
"Go from here
and treat everybody better."

31:21.899 --> 31:23.866
Do you agree, Dad?

31:23.868 --> 31:26.035
Yes.
Whatever it is, I agree.

31:26.037 --> 31:28.254
- Dad...
- Okay.

31:28.256 --> 31:29.455
With what?

31:29.457 --> 31:31.507
Nicky's saying
that every homily

31:31.509 --> 31:34.961
boils down to:
"Go and treat

31:34.963 --> 31:36.179
everyone better."

31:36.181 --> 31:37.380
Yeah, until they want

31:37.382 --> 31:38.514
an extra collection.

31:38.516 --> 31:40.683
Then they just make a pitch
for extra ka-ching.

31:40.685 --> 31:43.219
Yeah, but you think
about it, even that's about

31:43.221 --> 31:45.638
treating people better--
people who have less.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.106
That's the most
important message,

31:47.108 --> 31:49.275
and if more people
took it to heart,

31:49.277 --> 31:51.144
the world would be
a better place.

31:51.146 --> 31:53.646
Boys, dinner.

31:53.648 --> 31:55.615
But in His infinite wisdom,
He gave us obstacles

31:55.617 --> 31:57.817
so we wouldn't walk around
like saints all the time.

31:57.819 --> 31:59.035
Yeah.

31:59.037 --> 32:00.369
Like the Bitterman
Housing Projects.

32:01.739 --> 32:03.539
We all have a hand in that.

32:04.908 --> 32:06.542
So, what are we missing here?

32:06.544 --> 32:07.960
Uncle Jamie?

32:07.962 --> 32:10.279
He took an extra tour.

32:10.281 --> 32:13.166
Wine.

32:13.168 --> 32:15.168
Good eye, Pop.

32:15.170 --> 32:16.952
Who's turn is it?

32:16.954 --> 32:18.221
Uh...

32:18.223 --> 32:20.339
Jack, you're up.

32:20.341 --> 32:21.624
Okay.

32:21.626 --> 32:22.808
Hang-hang on.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.510
Oh.

32:24.512 --> 32:27.396
Ready?
Okay.

32:27.398 --> 32:29.298
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts,

32:29.300 --> 32:31.984
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

32:31.986 --> 32:33.536
through Christ our Lord, Amen.

32:33.538 --> 32:35.771
Amen.

32:39.576 --> 32:42.411
Hey, Vinny, we need backup
to go in there-- hold up!

32:42.413 --> 32:44.263
I got him, Reagan!
I got him!

32:44.265 --> 32:48.117
12-George requesting
a 10-85 forthwith.

32:48.119 --> 32:49.318
In a pursuit of a male Hispanic

32:49.320 --> 32:50.819
heading into the Bitter...
Bitterman Houses.

32:50.821 --> 32:51.787
We need backup.

32:54.007 --> 32:55.625
Stop! Police!

33:05.719 --> 33:07.603
Where the hell he go?

33:12.476 --> 33:15.010
Where is everybody?

33:17.564 --> 33:19.282
Vinny, it's a set-up.
Come on.

33:27.742 --> 33:30.493
Vinny! Vinny!

33:30.495 --> 33:32.461
10-13! 10-13!

33:32.463 --> 33:34.547
Officer's been shot!
Bitterman Houses!

33:34.549 --> 33:36.699
Main quad!

33:42.172 --> 33:44.473
Vinny, get up.

33:44.475 --> 33:46.509
Get up, man.
Get up, come on.

33:46.511 --> 33:48.477
Come on, get up. Get up.

33:48.479 --> 33:50.479
Come on.

33:53.067 --> 33:54.233
Okay... all right, got you.

33:54.235 --> 33:56.068
I got you.
All right, I got you.

33:56.070 --> 33:57.386
Hey, hey, Vinny.

33:57.388 --> 34:00.356
Okay, okay, all right...
Okay, hey...

34:00.358 --> 34:01.774
hey, you're gonna be okay.

34:01.776 --> 34:04.076
Hey, look at me.
Hey, look at me, Vinny.

34:04.078 --> 34:05.778
You're okay, all right?

34:06.864 --> 34:08.331
Hey... hey, don't
go anywhere, okay?

34:08.333 --> 34:10.666
Stay right here with me, okay?
Fight! Come on, fight!

34:10.668 --> 34:13.502
Hey, Vinny, come on.
Hey, stop smiling.

34:13.504 --> 34:15.004
Hey, look at me, man.

34:15.005 --> 34:16.589
Come on, look at me.
It's okay.

34:16.591 --> 34:18.206
It's okay, Reagan.
Okay...

34:18.208 --> 34:20.259
I told you.
What?

34:20.261 --> 34:22.043
I told you this is the end.

34:22.045 --> 34:23.212
What?

34:23.214 --> 34:24.096
It's the end.

34:24.098 --> 34:25.348
It's okay.

34:26.467 --> 34:28.301
Vinny...

34:28.303 --> 34:31.554
Vinny.

34:31.556 --> 34:33.639
Vinny...

34:54.911 --> 34:58.331
Your detail will take you out
to Officer Cruz's family

34:58.333 --> 35:00.299
directly after
your press conference.

35:01.618 --> 35:04.003
Jamie will want to be there.

35:04.005 --> 35:06.172
I'll talk to his CO.

35:09.009 --> 35:11.761
The paperwork
for Vinny's posthumous promotion

35:11.763 --> 35:13.896
to Detective First Grade.

35:23.740 --> 35:26.642
Commissioner,
the mayor just arrived.

35:28.028 --> 35:30.196
I put him in your office.

35:35.535 --> 35:38.587
Take a deep breath
before you say anything.

35:50.467 --> 35:54.387
Frank, I am so very sorry
for your loss.

35:54.389 --> 35:56.772
It's our loss.

35:56.774 --> 35:59.308
They all are.

35:59.310 --> 36:01.710
Indeed.

36:01.712 --> 36:04.296
Are you here
to join me at the podium?

36:04.298 --> 36:07.533
No. No.

36:07.535 --> 36:09.518
But this is more

36:09.520 --> 36:11.854
than the coldblooded murder
of a police officer.

36:11.856 --> 36:14.356
It's also the latest
in a long line of tragedies

36:14.358 --> 36:17.376
at the Bitterman Houses
and projects just like it.

36:17.378 --> 36:20.746
With all due respect, sir,
I don't have a script of my own,

36:20.748 --> 36:24.383
and I don't want one
from you today.

36:24.385 --> 36:26.836
I don't have a script.

36:26.838 --> 36:29.037
Just this.

36:33.877 --> 36:36.479
It's from the DA.

36:36.481 --> 36:39.899
His unofficial policy's
officially ended.

36:46.506 --> 36:48.441
Thank you.

36:48.443 --> 36:50.943
I know this may be
too little, too late.

36:50.945 --> 36:53.162
No.

36:54.898 --> 36:57.166
We need all the help
we can get.

36:58.585 --> 37:03.889
Police Officer Vincent Cruz
was killed in the line of duty

37:03.891 --> 37:06.392
in the Bitterman
Housing Projects

37:06.394 --> 37:09.378
where he was born.

37:10.347 --> 37:12.681
I knew Vinny.

37:12.683 --> 37:15.134
He was my son's partner,

37:15.136 --> 37:17.353
he was a member of our family,

37:17.355 --> 37:20.773
as well as the NYPD family.

37:20.775 --> 37:24.210
And the loss
we feel today...

37:24.212 --> 37:26.645
is immense.

37:30.016 --> 37:33.235
That loss has
to serve a purpose.

37:33.237 --> 37:38.007
Officer Cruz must not
have died in vain.

37:41.128 --> 37:44.413
Nor should the young woman
from the Bitterman Houses,

37:44.415 --> 37:46.515
Noni Palmeira,

37:46.517 --> 37:49.284
whose despair was so great

37:49.286 --> 37:52.922
that she took her own life

37:52.924 --> 37:56.158
and that of her baby boy.

37:56.160 --> 38:00.179
So I am making
a call to arms

38:00.181 --> 38:02.565
in their memory.

38:04.651 --> 38:07.686
We will find
Officer Cruz's killer

38:07.688 --> 38:09.972
and bring him to justice.

38:13.710 --> 38:16.445
But we must also find a way

38:16.447 --> 38:20.199
to win the trust of the good,
hardworking people

38:20.201 --> 38:22.167
who have lived too long

38:22.169 --> 38:25.120
under the tyranny
of a criminal few.

38:26.289 --> 38:29.124
You have a right to safety

38:29.126 --> 38:31.427
and security

38:31.429 --> 38:36.215
in your homes, your streets,
your playgrounds.

38:39.219 --> 38:41.387
But you cannot gain that

38:41.389 --> 38:44.306
without our help,

38:44.308 --> 38:46.675
and we cannot provide it

38:46.677 --> 38:49.011
without yours.

39:08.048 --> 39:10.382
Time to educate you, Santana.

39:10.384 --> 39:12.084
This is my game.

39:12.086 --> 39:16.138
You touch one of us,
we come back 35,000 deep.

39:16.140 --> 39:20.225
And we will liberate
the Bitter End.

39:20.227 --> 39:22.561
And yes, you can take that
as a threat.

39:25.982 --> 39:28.117
Pick up that coffee cup.
