01:14.247 --> 01:16.477
Hey, what was that again?

01:16.687 --> 01:17.642
What?

01:17.807 --> 01:18.842
The effect you said.

01:19.007 --> 01:20.235
The "lost paradise" effect.

01:20.407 --> 01:21.556
"Love"?

01:21.727 --> 01:24.924
Not love. "Lost."
"Lost paradise."

01:25.087 --> 01:27.555
The "lost paradise" effect.

01:27.727 --> 01:28.842
What is it?

01:29.007 --> 01:30.679
When the magic is gone,

01:30.847 --> 01:32.803
feeling nostalgic
about that first time...

01:32.967 --> 01:34.605
- For example?
- For example...

01:35.727 --> 01:37.319
When was the last time

01:37.487 --> 01:38.886
we saw each other?
A year ago,

01:39.047 --> 01:40.560
- more or less.
- At least.

01:40.727 --> 01:43.400
Has anything important
happened to you since?

01:43.567 --> 01:45.637
In the last six months.

01:45.807 --> 01:47.365
I don't know. Why?

01:47.527 --> 01:48.846
How about a year from now?

01:49.007 --> 01:50.281
You mean my life is boring?

01:50.447 --> 01:52.165
No, I mean the rhythm is different.

01:52.327 --> 01:54.795
We've already experienced everything
forthe first time.

01:54.967 --> 01:56.923
So what's wrong with nostalgia?

01:57.647 --> 01:59.365
Nothing is ever as good
as the first time.

02:01.967 --> 02:03.480
- What the hell is this?
- Here.

02:03.647 --> 02:05.444
- It's yours?
- Give it here.

02:05.647 --> 02:08.957
- You can't go barefoot through life.
- Give it here.

02:09.127 --> 02:10.082
You can't.

02:10.687 --> 02:11.563
Thank you.

02:12.727 --> 02:14.240
Hold on, I got it.

02:14.567 --> 02:15.522
Let me.

02:15.727 --> 02:16.443
I've got it.

02:16.607 --> 02:17.437
Let me.

02:17.647 --> 02:19.877
I've got it.
What do you want?

02:21.327 --> 02:22.999
Are you trying to feel me up?

02:23.167 --> 02:24.919
Say something, he never quits.

02:25.087 --> 02:26.236
It makes him happy.

02:28.487 --> 02:29.886
I'm going to the bathroom.

02:30.087 --> 02:31.884
- Can I come?
- Lf you dare.

02:35.047 --> 02:36.799
How's your boyfriend?

02:36.967 --> 02:40.004
Ask him when he gets here.
You wanted to meet him.

02:48.607 --> 02:50.199
I'm gonna fuck hertonight.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.838
If I haven't by sunrise,
breakfast is on me.

02:56.927 --> 02:57.837
You're kidding, right?

03:01.127 --> 03:03.880
I'm sorry, your credit card
doesn't work.

03:04.047 --> 03:05.765
It doesn't?
I used it earlier.

03:05.927 --> 03:07.326
Try it again, please.

03:07.487 --> 03:08.840
We already tried twice.

03:09.927 --> 03:11.326
Well, let me try.

03:36.407 --> 03:40.036
THE BODY SNATCHERS

04:26.007 --> 04:27.440
Ula, where are you going?

04:30.567 --> 04:32.319
Ula! Ula!

04:33.167 --> 04:35.203
Ula, come!

04:44.007 --> 04:45.918
Wanna hear some music?

04:49.007 --> 04:50.486
The storybook CD?

04:50.727 --> 04:52.126
Nothing.

04:57.287 --> 04:59.039
Don't you worry about Ula.

04:59.207 --> 05:02.438
She'll come back. Dogs always come
back when they get hungry.

05:09.127 --> 05:11.243
Please, Daddy, I don't want to!

05:11.647 --> 05:12.875
Pablo, get in the pool.

05:13.607 --> 05:15.165
- Please.
- You have to learn.

05:15.567 --> 05:16.716
Okay?

05:16.967 --> 05:18.082
Go on.

05:18.887 --> 05:21.082
- No, please.
- Pablo...

05:21.247 --> 05:24.000
No, please!

05:24.567 --> 05:26.842
Daddy, no!

05:27.207 --> 05:29.596
Daddy, don't leave me!

05:29.887 --> 05:31.206
Not in the water!

05:43.407 --> 05:47.798
<i>Take it easy, Jimmy. What's wrong?</i>
<i>School isn't such a b</i> a <i>d place.</i>

05:47.967 --> 05:50.435
<i>It's not his school,</i>
<i>it's my daughter-in-law.</i>

05:50.607 --> 05:52.199
<i>He's convinced</i>
<i>she isn't his mother.</i>

05:52.367 --> 05:53.846
<i>She isn't!</i>

05:54.007 --> 05:55.281
<i>Keep her aw</i> a <i>y from me!</i>

05:55.447 --> 05:57.244
<i>Nobody will force you, Jimmy.</i>

05:59.727 --> 06:01.240
Pablo shouldn't see this movie.

06:01.647 --> 06:03.160
He should be in bed.

06:05.767 --> 06:06.643
What?

06:07.687 --> 06:09.120
He should be in bed?

06:09.327 --> 06:10.760
I made dinner.

06:11.727 --> 06:13.160
Pablo, come on.

06:14.367 --> 06:15.163
Pablo.

06:20.647 --> 06:23.241
He's asleep.
I'll take him to bed later.

06:25.967 --> 06:27.605
This morning I made Ula's sign.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.599
I didn't make it to the pound.

06:30.767 --> 06:31.882
I'll go tomorrow.

06:33.207 --> 06:34.435
I'll get some wine.

06:34.607 --> 06:36.802
- Need anything from the kitchen?
- No.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.401
Manuel?

07:02.527 --> 07:03.846
Are you okay?

07:04.007 --> 07:06.441
Yeah, keep eating.
I'll be right in.

07:18.647 --> 07:19.921
What happened?

07:20.127 --> 07:22.038
Nothing.
I dropped the bottle.

07:22.207 --> 07:23.435
Let me see your hand.

07:23.607 --> 07:25.279
Is that blood or wine?

07:25.847 --> 07:28.281
- I don't know.
- You didn't feel the cut?

07:53.527 --> 07:54.562
Pablo!

08:17.447 --> 08:19.881
Honey, you're tickling me.
Can't you say it out loud?

08:20.047 --> 08:22.277
No, it's a secret.

08:25.247 --> 08:26.839
You're shooting Mommy?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.759
It only kills Martians.

08:28.927 --> 08:31.487
- Finish your dinner.
- It's ugly.

08:31.647 --> 08:32.921
- You're ugly.
- No, you are.

08:33.207 --> 08:35.357
- Mommy's ugly?
- Mommy's pretty.

08:35.886 --> 08:38.447
Come on, Pablo.
Just this tiny piece.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.515
Pablo, please. Eat it.

08:42.567 --> 08:43.443
Pablo,

08:43.607 --> 08:46.804
keep your food in your mouth.
It's not funny. Pablo!

08:52.487 --> 08:54.125
Pablo, chew your food.

08:54.287 --> 08:56.642
- I'm taking out the trash.
- Okay. Chew...

08:56.807 --> 08:58.001
Pablo, don't be a pig!

09:54.287 --> 09:55.720
Get dressed.

09:56.647 --> 09:59.081
- What for?
- Let's play pool.

09:59.287 --> 10:01.960
Where can you play pool
at midnight?

10:02.127 --> 10:03.242
In a bar.

10:03.407 --> 10:06.763
Sure, in one of the thousands
of bars around here.

10:07.167 --> 10:10.079
That's why we have two cars
parked outside.

10:11.447 --> 10:14.245
- You don't love me?
- Of course I do.

10:14.407 --> 10:15.237
Right.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.875
You love me but you won't play
pool with me.

10:18.047 --> 10:22.006
I love you, but it's late.
We both have to work in the morning.

10:22.647 --> 10:24.763
- What?
- You wanna fight?

10:27.767 --> 10:28.836
What are you doing?

10:29.007 --> 10:31.760
- Watch my tits.
- No fighting after midnight.

10:31.927 --> 10:34.043
Get your knee off me.

10:34.247 --> 10:37.922
Defend yourself.
Defend yourself...

10:39.087 --> 10:41.282
Stop it, you're hurting me.

10:41.567 --> 10:43.523
Enough already, Manuel.

10:48.687 --> 10:50.086
Sorry.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.361
Are you okay?

10:58.207 --> 11:00.004
Come to bed.

11:04.367 --> 11:06.005
I'm coming.

11:13.207 --> 11:14.686
Manuel.

11:17.407 --> 11:18.442
Hi.

11:18.607 --> 11:19.960
Where's Mommy?

11:20.967 --> 11:22.719
She went to the grocery store.

11:24.087 --> 11:25.361
This is for you.

11:29.327 --> 11:30.601
You don't want to see it?

11:44.967 --> 11:46.161
You like it?

11:49.967 --> 11:51.161
Had your snack yet?

11:53.367 --> 11:54.686
I'll fix you one.

12:05.807 --> 12:06.762
Pablo?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.043
Pablo!

12:16.767 --> 12:17.916
Pablo!

12:20.807 --> 12:21.637
Pablo.

12:32.567 --> 12:34.205
What are you doing
down there?

12:35.047 --> 12:36.275
Didrt you hear me?

12:36.447 --> 12:38.165
I've been calling you.

12:39.887 --> 12:41.240
Your snack is ready.

12:44.007 --> 12:46.999
Why did you leave the puppy alone?
Come on out of there.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.722
Go away.

12:49.607 --> 12:51.199
Pablo, please, come out.

12:52.007 --> 12:53.440
Get out of my room.

12:53.887 --> 12:55.002
Come out of there.

12:55.167 --> 12:56.600
Go away.
You're not my father.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.997
Pablo, that's enough.

12:59.287 --> 13:00.925
Let go. Let go!

13:01.447 --> 13:03.119
Come out, okay?
Let's go.

13:04.567 --> 13:07.604
That's enough nonsense.
Come on, sit down.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.803
Sit down, okay?

13:11.047 --> 13:12.446
What's wrong with you?

13:12.887 --> 13:14.525
Why are you looking at me
like that?

13:15.207 --> 13:16.003
Answer me!

13:20.807 --> 13:21.762
Speak.

13:23.527 --> 13:25.358
That's enough of the little gun.

13:25.567 --> 13:27.523
It's time for your snack,
you hear me?

13:29.887 --> 13:33.038
Wait, wait, wait.
Pablo, I'm sorry.

13:50.527 --> 13:52.165
Where are you two brats?

13:53.487 --> 13:55.045
You can come out now!

13:56.447 --> 13:58.403
Come on, that's enough.

13:59.167 --> 14:01.522
No, stay down.
He'll never see us.

14:02.607 --> 14:05.405
- That's enough!
- He's going to be mad.

14:05.647 --> 14:07.365
It's ajoke.
He plays them too.

14:07.607 --> 14:08.596
Sure.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.557
What? Are you scared of me?

14:19.767 --> 14:20.916
Am <i>I</i> scared of #you#?

14:25.287 --> 14:27.005
Then go with the flow.

14:28.247 --> 14:29.919
This isn't funny, you hear me?

14:30.887 --> 14:32.639
- Come on.
- Grow up a little.

14:32.807 --> 14:34.365
Come on.

14:37.287 --> 14:39.323
PLEASE LEARN HOW TO THINK

14:39.487 --> 14:40.283
Manuel.

14:43.607 --> 14:45.165
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

14:49.007 --> 14:50.406
Anyone need cigarettes?

14:50.567 --> 14:52.159
Get me two packs of Marlboro.

14:52.687 --> 14:53.961
Here.

14:56.207 --> 14:58.846
- Another drink?
- One more and I'm going home.

14:59.127 --> 15:01.038
It's been a year
and you're going home?

15:01.207 --> 15:02.435
It's late.

15:02.607 --> 15:04.916
For what?
Sunrise isn't until 7.

15:18.687 --> 15:20.996
- Cut it out.
- What?

15:21.687 --> 15:24.520
Stop poking me with your elbow.
That's the third time.

15:24.807 --> 15:25.557
What elbow?

15:25.727 --> 15:28.082
Make some fucking room.

15:28.247 --> 15:29.600
- Make room yourself.
- What?

15:29.767 --> 15:31.883
- Make room for your nuts...
- What's going on?

15:32.047 --> 15:34.083
- This jerk...
- Watch it.

15:34.407 --> 15:36.159
Watch what, asshole?
You're nothing.

15:36.927 --> 15:38.724
Calm down, Manuel.

15:38.887 --> 15:40.764
And step out of the way.

15:42.647 --> 15:45.207
We're here to have fun, right?

15:45.727 --> 15:46.921
Yes or no?

15:48.367 --> 15:51.040
You're wasting that cute smile
of yours.

15:53.367 --> 15:54.800
What's wrong?

15:54.967 --> 15:56.878
Manuel here wants to dance.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.680
Look after him for me.

15:58.887 --> 16:00.684
- Come on.
- I don't dance.

16:00.847 --> 16:02.075
- Why not?
- I just don't.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.046
You took something.

16:07.847 --> 16:09.041
Let me see...

16:10.687 --> 16:12.279
Manuel, say something to him.

16:12.727 --> 16:15.321
- "Say something to him." Give up.
- I give up.

16:15.487 --> 16:17.478
- Say, "Yes, sir."
- "Yes, sir. I give up."

16:23.727 --> 16:24.876
Fuck.

16:27.527 --> 16:28.642
Let's go.

16:29.887 --> 16:32.685
- Not that one, it's Pablo's.
- It's the only one.

16:32.847 --> 16:35.122
- Look harder.
- I already did.

16:35.287 --> 16:36.606
- No, you didn't.
- No.

16:36.847 --> 16:38.565
Well, there's a Dyango CD.

16:39.887 --> 16:41.400
I can't snort coke
on Dyango's face.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.239
- Why not?
- It's too creepy.

16:43.407 --> 16:45.967
He reminds me of my dad.
I feel him looking up at me.

16:47.487 --> 16:48.966
Jesus Christ, Ana.

16:49.127 --> 16:51.641
You're an old fart.
I can't believe you like Dyango.

16:51.807 --> 16:53.479
I don't, it's my wife's.

16:53.727 --> 16:55.285
She calls you sweetie pie.

16:56.767 --> 16:57.961
No, she doesn't.

16:58.127 --> 16:59.480
- Yes, she does.
- Be careful.

16:59.647 --> 17:01.205
- Don't drop it.
- Then slow down.

17:01.367 --> 17:02.482
I can't, I'm going 30.

17:03.687 --> 17:05.358
Julio, the coke...!
You're like kids.

17:05.527 --> 17:08.519
No wonder,
it's like Toys-R-Us in here.

17:09.007 --> 17:10.076
Wanna line?

17:13.646 --> 17:14.636
Check my nose.

17:15.887 --> 17:17.036
Just a pebble.

17:19.567 --> 17:20.920
Hey, what about me?

17:21.087 --> 17:22.839
Take it easy.

17:23.007 --> 17:24.804
Don't you worry, sweetie pie.

17:25.686 --> 17:27.165
Ana, pass me the bump.

17:27.406 --> 17:29.477
- What bump?
- The coke. You had it.

17:29.647 --> 17:31.285
It was on the CD case.

17:31.447 --> 17:33.642
- You're shitting me.
- You dropped it?

17:36.087 --> 17:37.315
Look for it.

17:37.487 --> 17:39.318
Relax and drive.

17:40.047 --> 17:42.083
Pablo doesn't crawl anymore,
right?

17:42.247 --> 17:43.919
It's coke, not a samurai sword.

17:44.127 --> 17:45.401
Shit, Julio.

17:46.127 --> 17:47.719
- Look down there.
- It's right here.

17:48.447 --> 17:50.517
You are such a dickhead.

17:51.407 --> 17:52.396
Shit, Ana.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.444
Get your feet off the roof.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.367
- They're clean, look.
- Yeah, I can see that.

17:57.807 --> 17:59.479
- Here.
- Hold the wheel.

18:07.807 --> 18:08.922
Which apartment is it?

18:09.087 --> 18:11.442
I don't know.
Don't look, I'm gonna pee.

18:17.327 --> 18:18.555
<i>Who is it?</i>.

18:18.767 --> 18:20.485
Mom, open up. I lost my keys.

18:20.647 --> 18:22.877
- <i>Jose Luis, are you drunk?</i>
- No.

18:23.927 --> 18:25.997
Yes, ma'am.
He took drugs, too!

18:26.447 --> 18:28.278
<i>I can't hear you, son.</i>
<i>Jose Luis?</i>

18:28.487 --> 18:29.522
Jose Luis!

18:29.727 --> 18:30.842
<i>Knock it off!</i>

18:31.007 --> 18:33.646
<i>I can't hear you</i>.
<i>I don't understand.</i>

18:33.927 --> 18:34.723
Open up!

18:39.487 --> 18:41.398
Damn, this stings.
What is it?

18:42.167 --> 18:43.964
Patriotic spirit. Stings, huh?

18:44.167 --> 18:46.044
- Yeah.
- What is it?

18:46.327 --> 18:48.363
- M.
- I'm gonna pee.

19:46.447 --> 19:49.962
Hey, stop killing yourself
and leave some for the rest of us.

19:50.807 --> 19:52.604
One more shot and I'm going home.

19:55.407 --> 19:56.556
Want me to kill you?

19:57.687 --> 19:59.120
I'd rather pull the trigger myself.

20:20.247 --> 20:21.521
A little swim?

20:24.807 --> 20:27.480
What, you think
they'd arrest us for this?

20:28.927 --> 20:29.996
Come on.

20:44.447 --> 20:46.358
- Keep it down.
- What?

20:46.767 --> 20:49.486
- Don't make so much noise.
- Why not?

20:58.167 --> 20:59.202
Come on.

21:02.487 --> 21:04.000
Do you say no to everything?

21:04.167 --> 21:05.156
No.

21:12.527 --> 21:13.880
You look like you're retired.

21:16.487 --> 21:18.523
Sitting on the shore
at the beach.

21:21.767 --> 21:23.598
Scared of the waves
or can't you swim?

21:23.767 --> 21:25.405
I have arthritis.

21:35.647 --> 21:37.365
Give me the gun.

21:46.927 --> 21:48.076
Help!

21:48.247 --> 21:50.158
Be quiet.
Someone will hear us.

21:56.127 --> 21:57.196
Who?

21:57.687 --> 21:59.245
There's nobody around.

21:59.527 --> 22:00.755
It's a hotel.

22:01.367 --> 22:03.164
Swimming at night is prohibited.

22:03.327 --> 22:04.646
- Is it?
- Yes.

22:06.327 --> 22:08.363
Suicidal <i>and</i> dumb.

22:32.127 --> 22:33.242
Wanna fuck?

22:34.407 --> 22:35.476
Right now?

22:43.647 --> 22:44.875
I don't think so.

22:47.607 --> 22:48.756
What about you?

22:51.327 --> 22:52.680
Me neither.

23:03.167 --> 23:04.316
Should we go back?

24:03.847 --> 24:05.280
I love you.

24:06.247 --> 24:07.475
I love you too.

24:09.607 --> 24:11.199
You're my best friend.

24:14.087 --> 24:15.315
What?

24:16.327 --> 24:18.363
What am I, your second best friend?

24:18.567 --> 24:19.761
You too.

24:20.527 --> 24:21.880
Me too what?

24:22.047 --> 24:23.639
You're my best friend too.

24:24.167 --> 24:25.759
I love you.

24:26.087 --> 24:27.315
I love you too.

24:29.007 --> 24:30.440
Give each other a peck.

24:30.767 --> 24:32.041
Just a peck.

24:36.207 --> 24:37.606
I love you.

24:39.047 --> 24:40.036
I love you too.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.319
You're my best friend.

24:43.007 --> 24:44.326
And you're mine.

24:47.047 --> 24:48.162
What?

24:48.367 --> 24:50.835
What am I, your second best friend?

24:51.007 --> 24:53.077
No. You're my first best friend.

24:53.847 --> 24:55.246
Mine too.

25:08.327 --> 25:11.319
PLEASE STOP THINKING NOW

25:12.407 --> 25:13.920
Want a fat one?

25:17.007 --> 25:19.157
Yeah, a nice fat one
will fix you right up.

25:19.327 --> 25:20.203
One second!

25:20.527 --> 25:21.482
Here, do this one.

25:23.367 --> 25:25.483
- How about a worm?
- Aworm...

25:26.287 --> 25:27.879
Aworm or a moustache?

25:28.207 --> 25:29.959
Aworm or a bell pepper?

25:30.127 --> 25:32.197
A bell pepper, a worm,
a moustache, the works.

25:33.007 --> 25:34.486
You're all over it.

25:36.247 --> 25:37.282
Hold on!

25:37.447 --> 25:39.517
Go on, do that one.

25:39.687 --> 25:41.598
I don't know if I can.

25:42.807 --> 25:45.002
Come on, already!
What the fuck?

25:45.167 --> 25:46.725
It's occupied!

25:47.247 --> 25:49.203
- It's occupied.
- Here.

25:53.567 --> 25:54.841
Hold still.

26:00.567 --> 26:01.966
Listen, Manuel.

26:02.527 --> 26:04.245
It's through the nose.

26:08.447 --> 26:10.085
Hold on a second.

26:16.927 --> 26:18.326
You snorted my line.

26:18.567 --> 26:19.841
- No...
- Yes, you did.

26:20.087 --> 26:21.679
You snorted my bell pepper.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.803
No, I didn't. Here.

26:23.967 --> 26:25.161
Snort this.

26:25.807 --> 26:28.719
- No, I want my bell pepper.
- Finely chopped.

26:37.487 --> 26:39.239
- I'm gonna pee.
- What?

26:39.407 --> 26:40.203
I'm gonna pee.

26:40.367 --> 26:42.597
Youjust did, Manuel.

26:44.127 --> 26:45.765
Right, I'm gonna pee.

26:59.287 --> 27:00.402
Occupied.

27:07.847 --> 27:08.882
Ana.

27:09.327 --> 27:10.282
Ana.

27:10.527 --> 27:12.518
It's Manuel, open up.

27:14.407 --> 27:15.317
Ana.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.319
What are you doing here?

27:43.367 --> 27:44.641
Be careful.

27:44.847 --> 27:46.803
Wait. Stop a second.

27:47.567 --> 27:48.795
Stop a second.

27:52.247 --> 27:53.521
Come here. Hold me.

27:55.927 --> 27:57.804
This isn't how I imagined it.

27:59.807 --> 28:01.445
- Imagined what?
- This.

28:02.047 --> 28:04.641
You're not like this.
I imagined something else.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.282
Come here.

28:12.727 --> 28:14.638
Let me. Sit there.

28:34.287 --> 28:35.686
What do you want me to do?

28:36.487 --> 28:37.966
Tell me. What do you want?

28:38.407 --> 28:39.726
I'm your wife.

28:39.967 --> 28:43.642
We just got married.
I'll do anything you want.

28:45.687 --> 28:47.200
No, stop.

28:48.607 --> 28:49.596
Stop...

28:49.767 --> 28:50.802
Stop...

28:51.367 --> 28:52.959
- Stop!
- What?

28:56.927 --> 28:58.155
You're right.

28:58.807 --> 29:00.206
I'm not like this.

29:00.567 --> 29:02.080
And neither are you.

29:12.727 --> 29:14.080
Get out of here.
Leave.

29:18.167 --> 29:19.282
I'm sorry.

29:19.447 --> 29:20.766
Get out!

29:27.207 --> 29:28.686
Manuel, Manuel...

29:29.287 --> 29:30.322
Manuel.

29:30.807 --> 29:31.956
Where are you going?

29:32.767 --> 29:35.725
- I'm going home.
- What for? I ordered you a drink.

29:36.607 --> 29:37.960
Come on, one last drink.

29:38.127 --> 29:39.446
One last drink.

29:39.687 --> 29:41.678
And a little bell pepper.

29:41.847 --> 29:43.565
Finely chopped.

29:49.487 --> 29:50.602
Wait.

29:53.447 --> 29:55.677
Manuel, Manuel...

29:58.767 --> 29:59.916
Manuel...

30:00.367 --> 30:02.039
You shouldn't be driving.

30:03.647 --> 30:05.285
Use this for a taxi

30:05.847 --> 30:09.078
and head straight home,
in style.

30:14.167 --> 30:15.282
And cheer up.

30:16.967 --> 30:19.845
You're wasting that cute smile
of yours.

30:22.367 --> 30:24.164
I'll tell you one thing, Manuel.

30:24.967 --> 30:29.040
At age 40, a man has the face
he deserves.

30:31.087 --> 30:33.317
You don't deserve that face.

30:33.807 --> 30:34.922
Right.

30:45.087 --> 30:46.645
You're drunk, Manuel.

30:47.487 --> 30:50.399
Tomorrow you'll see everything
in a different light.

30:51.367 --> 30:54.757
- Tomorrow, when?
- Pretty soon.

30:54.927 --> 30:57.441
It's already tomorrow.
It's late.

30:58.527 --> 30:59.562
I'll call you.

31:01.287 --> 31:03.164
I'll call you tomorrow.

31:06.967 --> 31:08.366
I'll call you tomorrow.

31:14.727 --> 31:17.480
Shit! Watch where
you're going, damn it.

31:18.607 --> 31:20.598
What? You can't see me, right?

31:21.767 --> 31:22.836
The bastard even laughs.

31:23.487 --> 31:24.522
Me?

31:24.887 --> 31:26.240
Who else, dickface?

31:26.447 --> 31:27.163
Me?

31:30.247 --> 31:31.123
Go on,

31:31.287 --> 31:33.198
get lost. Don't make it
worse for yourself.

31:33.967 --> 31:34.956
Me?

31:35.287 --> 31:36.766
Look, he's stuck.

31:38.567 --> 31:40.000
What's up, Grandpa?

31:40.207 --> 31:41.401
Nice "skijamas."

31:50.407 --> 31:51.635
Fucking coward!

31:53.767 --> 31:54.677
That's enough!

31:55.327 --> 31:56.521
You're fucking dead,

31:56.687 --> 31:57.802
asshole!

31:59.007 --> 32:01.237
- That's enough.
- Son of a bitch!

33:13.847 --> 33:17.044
- Manuel, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'll be right out.

33:18.767 --> 33:20.678
Come on, Pablo, it's late!

33:21.607 --> 33:23.086
Forty, right?

33:23.247 --> 33:24.805
Irene already paid me.

33:24.967 --> 33:26.082
Pablo!

33:26.487 --> 33:29.126
- I can take him if you want.
- No, it's okay.

33:30.527 --> 33:31.642
Pablo!

34:12.246 --> 34:14.158
You swim betterthan me now.

34:16.167 --> 34:17.235
Are you happy?

34:35.647 --> 34:37.683
Pablo, are you coming?

34:38.047 --> 34:39.275
Can I?

35:51.927 --> 35:54.441
HELLO? ANYBODY HOME?

35:57.207 --> 35:59.926
HI, LAURA.

36:00.287 --> 36:02.721
I LIKE YOUR PHOTO.
IS THAT YOU?

36:03.727 --> 36:04.762
YES.

36:10.247 --> 36:12.158
- OOPS!
- OOPS?

36:12.847 --> 36:14.280
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

37:06.167 --> 37:07.441
It's not for me.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.995
It's a gift.

37:20.087 --> 37:24.399
I left you a list of phone numbers
and server passwords.

37:24.567 --> 37:25.636
And the files?

37:26.127 --> 37:27.719
It's all in the server.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.639
Will there be anything else?

37:30.807 --> 37:33.480
No, thank you. I'd like to start
the interviews right away.

37:33.647 --> 37:34.716
Very well.

37:50.647 --> 37:53.081
Manuel, I don't know yet.
It depends on work.

37:53.287 --> 37:54.879
Yeah, a week. Or less.

37:56.287 --> 37:58.039
No, Friday.

37:58.727 --> 38:00.080
I prefer Friday, yes.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.595
Okay.

38:04.607 --> 38:06.916
You wanna tell Ana
or should I surprise her?

38:07.967 --> 38:09.320
ARE YOU IN TOWN YET?

38:09.927 --> 38:11.121
How are Irene and Pablo?

38:11.487 --> 38:12.397
Okay?

38:14.087 --> 38:15.839
Give them a kiss for me.
Bye.

38:16.007 --> 38:17.599
WHERE CAN WE HAVE LUNCH?

38:18.287 --> 38:22.246
I'm going to ask you a series
of questions. Answer honestly

38:22.407 --> 38:23.635
and as quickly as possible.

38:24.447 --> 38:25.596
Go ahead.

38:25.767 --> 38:27.678
You're at home watching TV

38:27.847 --> 38:30.566
and notice a scorpion
crawling up your leg.

38:30.807 --> 38:31.683
What do you do?

38:33.007 --> 38:34.281
I don't understand.

38:34.807 --> 38:36.399
It's your sors birthday,

38:36.567 --> 38:38.922
you're in a hurry to get home.
You're driving

38:39.087 --> 38:41.885
and you see a dying animal
in the road.

38:42.047 --> 38:43.036
Why is it dying?

38:43.287 --> 38:44.686
It got run over.

38:44.847 --> 38:46.678
Is it my car orthe company's?

38:46.847 --> 38:47.757
That's irrelevant.

38:47.927 --> 38:49.406
You get out of the car.

38:49.567 --> 38:50.886
It needs your help,

38:51.087 --> 38:53.681
but you get back in your car
and leave.

38:53.887 --> 38:56.845
Listen, I sell industrial
insulation and chemicals.

38:57.167 --> 38:58.316
Why not ask me about that?

38:58.487 --> 39:01.877
Flipping through a magazine at home,
you see a photo of a naked man.

39:02.047 --> 39:04.322
Are you asking if I'm gay
or a good salesman?

39:04.487 --> 39:07.479
Your wife has hung the photo
in your bedroom.

39:08.247 --> 39:10.761
Forget this nonsense
and check the sales figures.

39:11.047 --> 39:13.322
We all know you're here
to fire someone.

39:13.887 --> 39:15.206
You think we're idiots?

39:26.967 --> 39:28.161
Tell me a joke.

39:29.447 --> 39:30.596
Ajoke?

39:30.847 --> 39:33.281
- Ajoke. Tell me a joke.
- Well...

39:35.727 --> 39:38.605
I'm not very good at telling jokes.

39:42.887 --> 39:45.276
You're prettier in person
than in photos.

39:45.727 --> 39:48.161
Don't be silly.
I'm the same.

39:49.127 --> 39:50.242
I mean it.

39:53.527 --> 39:54.880
You didn't see the waiter

39:55.047 --> 39:56.162
staring at you?

39:56.647 --> 39:57.636
No.

39:58.487 --> 39:59.886
- You didn't?
- No.

40:00.487 --> 40:01.363
No?

40:02.007 --> 40:02.996
No.

40:23.047 --> 40:24.241
Better.

40:32.207 --> 40:34.357
I love the things you say in chat.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.159
They're so romantic.

40:38.447 --> 40:41.280
You're very special.
And sensitive.

40:43.367 --> 40:44.641
So are you.

41:13.407 --> 41:14.760
Don't touch me.

41:18.487 --> 41:19.966
Don't move.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.799
Stick your finger in my ass.

41:28.367 --> 41:29.880
Don't move.

41:30.207 --> 41:32.277
Another... another...

41:36.407 --> 41:38.523
Hold still, don't move.

41:40.527 --> 41:43.166
Right there...
Right there...

42:06.047 --> 42:06.877
Wait...

42:07.087 --> 42:08.361
Wait, please.

42:10.007 --> 42:11.918
Don't put them on yet.

42:15.087 --> 42:16.566
Turn around.

42:20.927 --> 42:24.556
You can come on me if you want.
I don't mind.

42:33.327 --> 42:35.636
Can I take the little bottles?

42:38.007 --> 42:39.156
What little bottles?

42:39.567 --> 42:41.797
Of shampoo and gel.
They replace them every day,

42:41.967 --> 42:43.241
right?

42:43.407 --> 42:44.965
Sure. Take anything you like.

42:45.127 --> 42:48.437
They're so small
ljust can't help myself.

43:00.647 --> 43:01.636
Laura.

43:01.807 --> 43:03.923
Marisa. My real name is Marisa.

43:04.447 --> 43:05.926
Marisa, sorry.

43:11.367 --> 43:13.198
I'm staying here all week.

43:15.407 --> 43:16.999
If you want we could have lunch,

43:20.487 --> 43:21.886
or dinner.

43:22.087 --> 43:23.361
Whatever you want.

43:26.887 --> 43:29.355
- Should I call you?
- Sure, call me and we'll see.

43:30.087 --> 43:31.315
Bye.

43:56.247 --> 43:57.646
Enjoy your meal.

43:57.807 --> 43:59.240
Thanks, likewise.

44:01.367 --> 44:02.641
See that guy back there?

44:04.287 --> 44:06.005
- Excuse me?
- Ramon Segovia.

44:06.167 --> 44:07.566
He's the one you should fire.

44:08.247 --> 44:10.158
He couldn't sell
to his own mother.

44:10.607 --> 44:12.518
Check last year's figures.

44:15.087 --> 44:16.236
Excuse me.

44:16.647 --> 44:18.717
Are you telling me
how to do my job?

44:18.887 --> 44:20.525
He's useless.

44:20.767 --> 44:23.156
Who really does hisjob, anyway?

44:23.607 --> 44:25.518
Who has to clean up his shit?

44:25.727 --> 44:26.955
We do.

44:28.407 --> 44:29.726
Does that seem fain'to you?

44:33.687 --> 44:34.961
Excuse me.

45:21.207 --> 45:22.879
- Got 5 minutes?
- Sure, Ramon. Come in.

45:23.047 --> 45:24.082
Thank you.

45:25.927 --> 45:27.246
Please, sit down.

45:33.567 --> 45:34.522
Listen...

45:36.127 --> 45:37.321
I know that...

45:37.927 --> 45:39.519
I haven't sold a lot.

45:40.047 --> 45:43.198
But it's that I'm not well.

45:43.367 --> 45:44.595
I'm not well.

45:46.967 --> 45:48.161
My wife...

45:50.567 --> 45:54.355
Last year my wife was diagnosed...

45:57.327 --> 46:01.479
First they said
she'd never see again,

46:03.087 --> 46:05.396
then they said
she'd never walk again,

46:06.927 --> 46:08.440
and in the end,

46:08.647 --> 46:10.558
they didn't know how to treat her.

46:11.767 --> 46:13.280
And I...

46:15.447 --> 46:17.802
For 7 months I did everything.

46:19.567 --> 46:20.682
Everything.

46:20.887 --> 46:24.436
I prepared her meals, washed her,

46:25.927 --> 46:27.201
combed her hair,

46:28.087 --> 46:30.442
turned her over in bed
so she wouldn't...

46:33.087 --> 46:34.202
It's very hard...

46:35.447 --> 46:39.963
seeing the person you love like that
and not being able to help.

46:41.407 --> 46:43.637
But it ended up working out.

46:44.527 --> 46:45.801
She got better.

46:47.367 --> 46:48.436
And...

46:49.687 --> 46:53.316
And a couple of weeks ago

46:55.647 --> 46:58.559
I got home and she wasrt there.

47:02.047 --> 47:03.639
She'd left, just like that,

47:03.847 --> 47:07.886
without saying where or why.
Nothing.

47:08.087 --> 47:10.362
Not even a note.
Nothing.

47:18.687 --> 47:20.837
I'm sorry, forgive me...

48:23.927 --> 48:25.406
What bastards.

48:43.367 --> 48:44.800
I'll be right back.

48:46.447 --> 48:47.721
What is this?

48:47.927 --> 48:49.246
- What you asked me for.
- Is it?

48:49.487 --> 48:52.001
What did I ask you for?
Check the money. How much?

48:52.167 --> 48:55.239
- Four grams, right?
- That's four grams?

48:55.407 --> 48:56.681
Four grams, straight up.

48:56.847 --> 48:58.280
Give me my money.

48:59.487 --> 49:02.320
Just give me my money.
Take your stuff and give me back

49:02.487 --> 49:03.442
my money.

49:03.607 --> 49:05.086
What, don't you trust me?

49:05.287 --> 49:07.755
My bike is outside.
We can weigh it back at my place.

49:08.207 --> 49:09.845
- You're not from around here.
- Why?

49:10.007 --> 49:11.486
- What's your name?
- And you?

49:11.647 --> 49:13.080
- Julio, you?
- Jesus.

49:13.247 --> 49:16.683
- How long you been at this, Jesus?
- And you?

49:18.287 --> 49:19.436
My money.

49:23.607 --> 49:24.881
Leave that there a second.

49:25.327 --> 49:26.362
I won't touch it.

49:26.527 --> 49:28.563
Leave it there, I won't touch it.

49:29.207 --> 49:31.402
Let's start over, Jesus.
From the beginning.

49:32.207 --> 49:34.482
How much are four grams
at 60 a gram?

49:34.647 --> 49:35.443
240.

49:35.647 --> 49:38.241
Good, 240.
Here are your 240 euros...

49:38.407 --> 49:40.557
and my four grams.
Is that right?

49:41.727 --> 49:44.366
What, you don't trust me?
Your bike is outside,

49:44.527 --> 49:47.121
we can count it at your place.
Are we good?

49:47.887 --> 49:49.002
What do you think?

49:49.567 --> 49:50.966
You owe me one, Jesus.

49:51.527 --> 49:52.721
Rememberthat.

49:52.887 --> 49:53.956
You owe me one.

49:54.447 --> 49:56.039
So keep your cell phone on.

50:02.087 --> 50:03.759
And a little advice, Jesus.

50:03.927 --> 50:05.280
Next time change your shirt.

50:05.527 --> 50:07.245
It stinks of fried food.

50:07.407 --> 50:09.318
That's not good
for a drug dealer.

50:26.047 --> 50:28.117
- You took something.
- Me?

50:29.807 --> 50:30.842
Let's see.

50:31.807 --> 50:34.037
- Let me see your nose.
- No.

50:34.247 --> 50:35.282
- Show me...
- No.

50:35.447 --> 50:37.802
- Let me see it...
- No, I won't let you.

50:41.367 --> 50:44.040
Okay, okay.
Manuel, say something to him!

50:44.287 --> 50:45.402
"Manuel, say something to him!"

50:46.607 --> 50:48.120
- Give up?
- Yes, I give up.

50:48.287 --> 50:51.518
Not "Yes, I give up."
"Yes, sir. I give up."

50:52.127 --> 50:53.719
"Yes, sir. I give up."

51:01.367 --> 51:02.482
Want some?

51:03.687 --> 51:04.756
What is it?

51:06.407 --> 51:07.601
A line.

51:08.287 --> 51:09.481
Not ifit's M.

51:10.167 --> 51:11.395
You don't like M?

51:11.647 --> 51:13.080
No, I get sick.

51:17.327 --> 51:18.555
How about coke?

51:21.487 --> 51:23.796
Guess which hand
and it's my treat.

51:31.847 --> 51:32.996
Let's go.

51:58.207 --> 51:59.276
Don't look.

51:59.607 --> 52:01.404
Don't look?
This is paradise.

52:09.367 --> 52:10.686
Don't look at them.

52:10.847 --> 52:13.441
What do you want me to do?
Look at the floor?

52:13.727 --> 52:15.160
Look at me.

52:16.127 --> 52:17.242
Come on.

52:29.207 --> 52:31.198
Stop looking at my tits.
I see you.

52:31.847 --> 52:33.075
It's them.

52:33.647 --> 52:34.602
It's them.

52:34.767 --> 52:36.200
Look at your nipples.

52:37.167 --> 52:39.283
You're either happy to see me

52:40.127 --> 52:42.641
or you're cold.
And it's hot in here.

52:43.247 --> 52:44.566
Or the M is hitting you.

52:44.847 --> 52:46.485
Get a glass for Manuel.

52:50.767 --> 52:51.995
Show them to me.

52:52.167 --> 52:53.646
- What, my tits?
- Yeah.

52:53.887 --> 52:55.081
Let me see them.

52:55.647 --> 52:57.956
We're friends, right?
I've never seen them.

52:58.687 --> 52:59.915
And you never will.

53:00.407 --> 53:01.726
I'm just curious.

53:02.087 --> 53:04.203
I'm really not into big tits.

53:05.127 --> 53:07.038
They remind me of my mother.

53:07.967 --> 53:10.356
I must be going through
my oral stage.

53:11.367 --> 53:14.677
What do you do if you're with a girl
with big tits?

53:14.847 --> 53:16.121
Ask herto read a story?

53:16.767 --> 53:19.042
No. I ask her
to let me see them.

53:19.647 --> 53:20.966
Forget it, Julio.

53:21.127 --> 53:22.082
I'm not going to.

53:22.287 --> 53:24.243
- Not even just one?
- Not even one.

53:27.767 --> 53:29.405
What are you doing?

53:29.687 --> 53:30.961
It's fair, right?

53:31.487 --> 53:32.761
I show you my cock,

53:32.927 --> 53:35.077
- you show me yourtits.
- Put that away.

53:45.127 --> 53:47.766
Let's find a room and get lost
for a little while.

53:47.927 --> 53:49.042
Julio...

53:50.847 --> 53:51.882
Julio, please.

53:53.007 --> 53:54.235
Julio, stop it!

53:54.647 --> 53:57.400
It's me, Julio.
Your buddy.

53:58.167 --> 53:59.316
You see?

54:00.927 --> 54:02.326
It's just a little joke.

54:03.167 --> 54:04.805
I don't like your jokes.

54:06.527 --> 54:08.483
Arert you forgetting something?

54:09.687 --> 54:10.881
Fuck you.

54:21.487 --> 54:25.685
Give me 50 euros or I'll tell
everybody what you did.

54:26.167 --> 54:27.156
Over here.

54:40.407 --> 54:41.601
Been sitting there long?

54:44.647 --> 54:45.636
What did you see?

54:46.207 --> 54:47.481
Everything.

54:51.647 --> 54:52.921
What have you drunk?

54:53.087 --> 54:54.156
Nothing.

54:54.727 --> 54:56.319
Look, come closer.

55:03.647 --> 55:05.205
Rum and Coke.

55:07.127 --> 55:08.560
I know where the bottles are.

55:09.247 --> 55:11.886
- How?
- Because I know everything.

55:12.567 --> 55:13.920
I live here.

55:15.887 --> 55:20.039
How about I give you 15 euros
and you go to bed?

55:22.407 --> 55:23.840
25.

55:24.487 --> 55:25.636
15.

55:25.927 --> 55:27.076
20.

55:28.367 --> 55:29.846
- 20.
- Okay.

55:30.007 --> 55:31.235
Let's go.

55:32.327 --> 55:34.079
- There's a problem.
- What?

55:34.967 --> 55:37.003
I don't think I can stand up.

55:37.727 --> 55:40.241
- You look like Justin Timberlake.
- Never heard of him.

55:40.527 --> 55:43.121
- Only older.
- Ouch!

55:43.647 --> 55:45.000
See who that is.

55:46.047 --> 55:48.481
Put me in bed first, dummy.

55:48.647 --> 55:50.285
Or I'll throw up on you.

55:56.847 --> 55:59.156
- Who is it?
- Jonathan.

55:59.407 --> 56:01.125
Turn it off.
He's a nobody.

56:08.767 --> 56:10.200
Is that you in the photo?

56:15.447 --> 56:17.039
How old are you, Nuria?

56:17.687 --> 56:19.678
How do you know my name is Nuria?

56:19.847 --> 56:21.326
Because I know everything.

56:22.247 --> 56:24.807
More than 10 and less than 30.

56:30.647 --> 56:32.717
Is that tattoo real?

56:33.047 --> 56:35.720
Of course not, silly.
I'm 12 years old.

56:38.127 --> 56:39.082
Come here.

56:43.927 --> 56:44.962
Come here.

56:46.047 --> 56:47.241
Come here.

56:50.087 --> 56:51.566
Take off my shoes,

56:51.727 --> 56:52.876
I can't reach.

57:10.367 --> 57:12.005
I think I'm falling asleep.

57:13.487 --> 57:14.806
Go to sleep.

58:04.607 --> 58:06.199
Hey, chump.

58:06.927 --> 58:08.519
My 20 euros.

58:27.447 --> 58:28.766
Where have you been?

58:30.127 --> 58:31.924
I've been looking all over for you.

58:35.447 --> 58:36.800
Have you seen Manuel?

58:41.647 --> 58:42.796
Are you okay?

58:50.607 --> 58:51.801
What's wrong?

58:52.607 --> 58:54.404
I lost a sandal.

58:54.887 --> 58:58.562
I had two before.
Now I only have one. I lost it.

59:02.487 --> 59:05.524
You have pretty feet.

59:07.407 --> 59:09.045
Anyone evertold you that?

59:12.727 --> 59:13.876
Don't worry.

59:14.847 --> 59:17.486
It's already after midnight, right?
You won't turn

59:17.647 --> 59:18.841
into a pumpkin.

59:20.247 --> 59:21.919
Was that a smile?

59:22.687 --> 59:24.040
Look at me.

59:24.887 --> 59:26.286
A smile?

59:31.327 --> 59:32.885
What's with that shirt?

59:33.807 --> 59:35.604
Where were you,
at a flea market?

59:35.967 --> 59:37.286
You look handsome.

59:37.447 --> 59:38.766
Handsome, she says.

59:38.927 --> 59:40.883
He looks like the beach patrol.

59:41.047 --> 59:42.241
No, I don't!

59:44.407 --> 59:45.601
Let's go.

59:45.767 --> 59:47.359
- Where?
- I don't care.

59:47.527 --> 59:49.040
Anywhere else.

59:49.207 --> 59:50.799
I'm not going anywhere

59:50.967 --> 59:52.605
- with this porn actor.
- Why not?

01:00:48.887 --> 01:00:50.366
Stop, stop!

01:00:50.527 --> 01:00:51.164
Here?

01:00:51.367 --> 01:00:52.197
Yeah, here.

01:00:53.127 --> 01:00:53.923
Where are you going?

01:00:55.807 --> 01:00:57.035
Don't leave.

01:00:57.727 --> 01:00:59.080
No, I'll be right back.

01:00:59.847 --> 01:01:00.802
Buddy!

01:01:03.767 --> 01:01:06.406
- I want three of these.
- Two?

01:01:06.567 --> 01:01:07.886
Three.

01:01:08.367 --> 01:01:09.197
How much?

01:01:09.527 --> 01:01:10.642
Three euros.

01:01:10.807 --> 01:01:12.638
Boy! Hearts are getting expensive!

01:01:13.727 --> 01:01:14.796
Julio!

01:01:15.007 --> 01:01:17.441
- Manuel's falling asleep!
- I'm coming.

01:01:18.447 --> 01:01:21.007
- I don't have change.
- That's okay, keep it.

01:01:21.207 --> 01:01:22.162
Thank you.

01:01:22.327 --> 01:01:24.477
Go to bed,
that's enough for today.

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:25.716
Thank you.

01:01:28.007 --> 01:01:29.565
What did you buy?

01:01:30.247 --> 01:01:33.159
- A new heart for each of us.
- How cute!

01:02:03.447 --> 01:02:04.766
Feel me up.

01:02:06.087 --> 01:02:07.805
Touch my tits and my ass.

01:02:11.687 --> 01:02:12.836
Come on.

01:02:13.087 --> 01:02:15.840
I'm your wife.
What are you waiting for?

01:02:16.447 --> 01:02:17.641
Feel me up.

01:02:18.087 --> 01:02:19.679
Touch my tits and my ass.

01:02:43.567 --> 01:02:44.795
Got any left?

01:02:50.927 --> 01:02:53.202
Let's get some
and go back to my place.

01:02:55.487 --> 01:02:56.681
You want to?

01:03:37.767 --> 01:03:38.995
What is this?

01:03:39.207 --> 01:03:42.597
It's a PDA.
You don't know what a PDA is?

01:03:43.367 --> 01:03:46.165
- Atelephone.
- Atelephone, yes. A PDA.

01:03:48.087 --> 01:03:49.202
I already have a phone.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:50.595
I know you do.

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:55.366
But this is much more than a phone.
It's a computer.

01:03:56.047 --> 01:03:57.799
It's like a computer.

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.161
You know what they cost?

01:03:59.327 --> 01:04:02.239
- Why do I need a computer?
- What do you mean?

01:04:02.527 --> 01:04:04.995
Look at it. It has Wi-Fi.

01:04:06.087 --> 01:04:07.122
Wi-Fi?

01:04:07.647 --> 01:04:11.117
It has Wi-Fi,
it's like a computer with Wi-Fi.

01:04:11.287 --> 01:04:13.278
- Never heard ofWi-Fi?
- Why do I need Wi-Fi?

01:04:13.447 --> 01:04:15.085
I don't know, Jesus.

01:04:15.247 --> 01:04:16.646
Keep it...

01:04:17.607 --> 01:04:21.441
or sell it.
Give it to your girlfriend.

01:04:22.007 --> 01:04:25.761
Or your cousin. Do whatever
you want with it. It's all I've got.

01:04:29.767 --> 01:04:31.120
Let me see your watch.

01:04:34.647 --> 01:04:35.716
My watch?

01:04:35.887 --> 01:04:37.445
Your watch, let me see it.

01:04:39.687 --> 01:04:41.837
Are you sure?
Look closely, Jesus.

01:04:42.727 --> 01:04:46.959
It's a PDA. A computer with Wi-Fi.
You can chat with Wi-Fi.

01:04:47.127 --> 01:04:49.687
Ever heard of Wi-Fi, Jesus?

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.403
Stop going on about the damn Wi-Fi.

01:04:52.567 --> 01:04:53.966
I'm not interested.

01:04:55.367 --> 01:04:56.880
The watch or nothing.

01:05:34.207 --> 01:05:35.435
I'll give you two grams.

01:05:37.687 --> 01:05:40.076
Not two grams, Jesus.
Look at the watch.

01:05:40.527 --> 01:05:41.721
Two grams.

01:05:48.567 --> 01:05:49.966
Two of your grams

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:52.277
ortwo of my grams?

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:55.846
Forthe watch and your shirt.

01:05:58.407 --> 01:05:59.681
My shirt?

01:06:01.847 --> 01:06:03.758
Where would I go without a shirt?

01:06:04.007 --> 01:06:06.043
Where would I go without a shirt?

01:06:42.127 --> 01:06:43.242
Can I?

01:06:45.207 --> 01:06:46.606
Sure you can.

01:06:47.487 --> 01:06:49.557
- What was your name again?
- Andy.

01:06:49.967 --> 01:06:51.764
And your friend? Lucas?

01:06:52.647 --> 01:06:53.796
Garcia.

01:06:54.407 --> 01:06:57.160
- And you?
- I'm Miguel.

01:06:58.207 --> 01:06:59.560
Miguel Strogoff.

01:07:00.207 --> 01:07:02.482
- Are you Russian?
- Blind.

01:07:07.407 --> 01:07:09.079
- Lucas!
- Garcia.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:11.642
Garcia.

01:07:12.527 --> 01:07:13.676
The baby bottle.

01:07:20.807 --> 01:07:22.081
Want some, Ana?

01:07:23.127 --> 01:07:24.196
What is it?

01:07:25.527 --> 01:07:26.960
Kryptonite.

01:07:36.447 --> 01:07:37.562
Sorry.

01:07:39.327 --> 01:07:40.646
Why sorry?

01:07:41.647 --> 01:07:43.683
There's plenty, look.

01:07:43.967 --> 01:07:47.198
There's a lot more.
Today is Neverland.

01:07:57.447 --> 01:07:59.961
Today is Neverland.

01:08:56.886 --> 01:08:57.956
Julio...

01:09:07.407 --> 01:09:08.635
Julio, no.

01:09:08.807 --> 01:09:10.684
- No, what?
- No.

01:12:27.287 --> 01:12:29.278
<i>Sir, it's eleven thirty.</i>

01:12:31.687 --> 01:12:33.120
<i>Sir?</i>

01:12:34.847 --> 01:12:36.599
- Yes.
- <i>Are you awake?</i>

01:12:41.807 --> 01:12:42.762
Yes.

01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:44.880
<i>Are you all right?</i>.

01:12:49.247 --> 01:12:50.236
Yes.

01:12:51.487 --> 01:12:53.079
<i>Have a good day, sir.</i>

01:13:19.247 --> 01:13:20.965
Where are you going?

01:13:21.247 --> 01:13:24.603
Home, I have to change
before I go to work.

01:13:26.807 --> 01:13:28.923
It's 7 AM, stay a little longer.

01:13:29.887 --> 01:13:30.956
I can't.

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.804
Why not? It's early.

01:13:34.687 --> 01:13:37.918
I wouldn't have to get up so early
if we lived together.

01:13:38.087 --> 01:13:39.839
Not again, Luis. Please.

01:13:40.407 --> 01:13:44.082
You could at least give me a drawer
for a change of clothes.

01:13:44.247 --> 01:13:46.442
A few pairs of socks
and underwear.

01:13:46.767 --> 01:13:48.166
Put on my panties.

01:13:49.407 --> 01:13:51.398
- What are you looking for?
- My shoe.

01:13:51.727 --> 01:13:52.762
It's here.

01:13:58.207 --> 01:13:59.526
The light!

01:13:59.687 --> 01:14:00.881
I can't see.

01:14:01.087 --> 01:14:02.406
Down here...

01:14:03.207 --> 01:14:04.037
Gotcha!

01:14:10.087 --> 01:14:12.317
- I have to go, Ana.
- No, don't leave.

01:14:12.647 --> 01:14:13.841
I have to.

01:14:14.687 --> 01:14:15.802
Really, I'm late.

01:14:22.727 --> 01:14:25.366
You still haven't worn the sandals
I gave you?

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.802
Acouple times,
but they hurt my feet.

01:14:28.967 --> 01:14:30.559
Want me to make coffee?

01:14:33.407 --> 01:14:34.886
What's so funny?

01:14:36.127 --> 01:14:37.719
You're unbelievable, Ana.

01:14:37.927 --> 01:14:41.920
You won't give me a drawer
but you'll make me coffee at 7 AM?

01:14:42.087 --> 01:14:43.839
What's that got to do with it?

01:14:45.607 --> 01:14:47.199
Go back to sleep.

01:14:48.407 --> 01:14:50.762
- I'll call you later, okay?
- Okay.

01:15:53.327 --> 01:15:54.680
Hold still.

01:15:57.607 --> 01:15:58.835
Hold still.

01:15:59.727 --> 01:16:00.921
It's okay.

01:16:01.287 --> 01:16:02.959
Who did this to you?

01:16:04.007 --> 01:16:05.599
Such a pretty girl...

01:16:14.647 --> 01:16:16.205
Open your mouth.

01:16:18.047 --> 01:16:20.515
It's an aspirin forthe pain.

01:16:20.687 --> 01:16:22.200
Ana takes them too.

01:16:23.527 --> 01:16:24.755
Very good.

01:16:24.967 --> 01:16:26.195
Very good, sweetie.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:50.325
What is it, gorgeous?

01:17:16.087 --> 01:17:17.315
What are you doing?

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:19.520
What are you after?

01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:28.842
What is it?

01:17:37.967 --> 01:17:39.241
Stay there.

01:17:40.367 --> 01:17:41.356
Stay.

01:17:45.607 --> 01:17:46.881
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:48.520
This is a surprise.

01:17:49.807 --> 01:17:50.637
Hi, Pablo.

01:17:50.887 --> 01:17:52.445
- Can I have a kiss?
- Go on.

01:17:52.687 --> 01:17:55.804
You remember Ana, don't you?
She's Daddy's friend.

01:17:56.967 --> 01:17:58.082
Want to come in?

01:17:58.487 --> 01:18:00.079
No, wejust came to say hi.

01:18:00.247 --> 01:18:03.080
Ula is lost. We're putting up signs
in the area.

01:18:03.247 --> 01:18:04.123
Right, Pablo?

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.526
I'll leave you one.

01:18:07.527 --> 01:18:09.757
- I didn't know you had a dog.
- Yes.

01:18:11.407 --> 01:18:12.362
Pablo...

01:18:15.887 --> 01:18:17.320
See you at the dinner, right?

01:18:17.487 --> 01:18:19.443
No, I'll be out of town.

01:18:20.007 --> 01:18:21.884
Say goodbye to Ana.
Say goodbye.

01:18:23.087 --> 01:18:24.281
It's no use.

01:18:25.807 --> 01:18:27.479
- See you later.
- Bye.

01:18:27.767 --> 01:18:29.120
What's the matter?

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:31.885
You don't remember Ana?

01:18:39.767 --> 01:18:42.725
I promise I'll take you back
when you're better.

01:18:45.247 --> 01:18:46.441
Are you hungry?

01:18:49.327 --> 01:18:51.921
Come on, take it.

01:18:52.567 --> 01:18:53.841
Come on.

01:18:54.687 --> 01:18:57.201
Come on, take it.

01:19:01.087 --> 01:19:02.202
Very good.

01:19:04.167 --> 01:19:05.441
Want some more?

01:19:09.327 --> 01:19:11.557
Want some more?
Come and get it.

01:19:11.767 --> 01:19:12.882
Not hungry enough?

01:19:14.247 --> 01:19:15.885
Here, take it.

01:19:16.607 --> 01:19:17.960
Very good.

01:19:18.527 --> 01:19:19.801
Very good.

01:19:36.527 --> 01:19:39.246
- Why are you stopping?
- Be quiet for a second.

01:19:42.447 --> 01:19:44.244
- Did you hearthat?
- What?

01:19:45.087 --> 01:19:46.964
Like a moaning sound.

01:19:47.567 --> 01:19:49.159
I didn't hear anything.

01:20:24.087 --> 01:20:26.396
You don't look like an Ula.

01:20:26.687 --> 01:20:28.643
Ula is a very ugly name.

01:20:31.007 --> 01:20:34.079
From now on your name
will be Niebla.

01:20:34.847 --> 01:20:37.839
Niebla is a pretty name,
isn't it?

01:20:48.167 --> 01:20:50.556
- Hi, what's up?
- <i>Are you at home?</i>

01:20:50.727 --> 01:20:53.605
- No, I'm not.
- <i>I'm getting off early...</i>

01:20:53.767 --> 01:20:56.759
- I can't today.
- <i>I thought I'd stop by.</i>

01:20:56.927 --> 01:20:59.361
I'm really busy right now.
I'll call you later. Bye.

01:20:59.527 --> 01:21:00.482
<i>Fine.</i>

01:21:05.007 --> 01:21:06.360
What's that look for?

01:21:07.687 --> 01:21:08.915
Are you jealous?

01:21:14.087 --> 01:21:15.076
Sit.

01:21:17.207 --> 01:21:18.037
Come on,

01:21:18.287 --> 01:21:19.197
sit.

01:21:27.167 --> 01:21:28.122
Here.

01:21:34.247 --> 01:21:35.396
Where are you going?

01:21:42.807 --> 01:21:44.923
What's wrong, aren't you hungry?

01:21:47.487 --> 01:21:48.476
Come here.

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:52.526
Niebla, come here.

01:21:56.367 --> 01:21:58.403
What's wrong?
Can't you hear me?

01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:04.355
Come here.

01:22:21.407 --> 01:22:22.362
Stay there.

01:22:24.527 --> 01:22:26.245
When I tell you to do something,

01:22:26.407 --> 01:22:27.601
do it!

01:22:35.607 --> 01:22:36.676
Niebla?

01:23:00.807 --> 01:23:03.719
- You can't operate?
- It wouldn't help.

01:23:04.167 --> 01:23:07.079
Her kidneys aren't working.
She can't even see you.

01:23:07.527 --> 01:23:08.755
She's blind.

01:23:11.167 --> 01:23:13.965
I'm sorry, but you should
put herto sleep.

01:23:15.607 --> 01:23:18.804
All she can do is suffer
and wait to die.

01:23:43.847 --> 01:23:46.919
<i>Hi, it's Luis.</i>
<i>Leave</i> a <i>message after the beep.</i>

01:23:48.047 --> 01:23:51.357
Luis, it's me.
We finished dinner.

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:54.678
We'll probably go for drinks.
Call me and we'll meet up later.

01:23:55.567 --> 01:23:57.444
I'm out with two men here...

01:23:58.047 --> 01:23:59.480
Call me. Bye.

01:24:05.087 --> 01:24:07.157
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:07.447 --> 01:24:08.766
Can you handle another?

01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:10.526
- Another what?
- Another shot.

01:24:10.687 --> 01:24:11.961
It was a shot, right?

01:24:12.367 --> 01:24:14.323
- Are you buying?
- What will it be?

01:24:14.807 --> 01:24:15.922
You wanna get me drunk?

01:24:16.087 --> 01:24:17.679
You get drunk that fast?

01:24:19.127 --> 01:24:20.799
Tequila. A shot of tequila.

01:24:21.607 --> 01:24:22.960
Three shots of tequila.

01:24:24.007 --> 01:24:27.443
What's the plan? If you get me drunk
you must have one.

01:24:28.647 --> 01:24:32.083
A few drinks, dancing...
Have a little fun...

01:24:32.847 --> 01:24:35.122
Are those fogies
friends of yours?

01:24:36.607 --> 01:24:38.518
- Why, you like one of them?
- Tell them

01:24:38.687 --> 01:24:41.042
you're going home
and come for a ride with us.

01:24:43.607 --> 01:24:45.916
Sorry, boys.
That's not my thing.

01:24:51.007 --> 01:24:53.077
- Which apartment is it?
- I don't know.

01:24:53.767 --> 01:24:55.120
Don't look, I'm gonna pee.

01:25:01.007 --> 01:25:03.123
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Mom, it's me. Open up.

01:25:07.447 --> 01:25:10.484
<i>Hi, it's Luis.</i>
<i>Leave</i> a <i>message after the beep.</i>

01:25:11.167 --> 01:25:13.727
It's me again. Where are you?
Werert you coming?

01:25:14.727 --> 01:25:16.763
I don't know why your cell is off.

01:25:18.007 --> 01:25:19.520
We're at Juars party.

01:25:19.727 --> 01:25:22.036
Call me, please.

01:25:26.327 --> 01:25:27.237
Open up!

01:25:29.567 --> 01:25:30.317
Ana...

01:25:31.687 --> 01:25:32.517
Ana!

01:25:33.367 --> 01:25:34.482
I'm coming!

01:25:39.247 --> 01:25:41.283
Damn, that stings.
What is this?

01:25:42.207 --> 01:25:44.721
- Patriotic spirit. Stings, huh?
- It sure does.

01:25:44.927 --> 01:25:46.679
- What is it?
- M.

01:25:48.167 --> 01:25:49.441
I'm gonna pee.

01:25:56.007 --> 01:25:57.201
What are you doing?

01:25:59.367 --> 01:26:00.516
Why?

01:26:00.927 --> 01:26:02.440
I thought M made you sick.

01:26:02.607 --> 01:26:03.642
Did I say that?

01:27:15.607 --> 01:27:17.598
- Where are we going?
- In back.

01:27:17.767 --> 01:27:19.120
It's too far. Drink.

01:27:20.087 --> 01:27:21.679
- Arert you thirsty?
- No.

01:27:23.207 --> 01:27:25.516
- Are you a horse or a drug dealer?
- Both.

01:27:31.767 --> 01:27:33.166
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:27:35.527 --> 01:27:36.721
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:27:37.527 --> 01:27:38.482
Let's go.

01:27:40.567 --> 01:27:41.397
Come on.

01:27:45.327 --> 01:27:46.362
What's wrong?

01:27:47.247 --> 01:27:48.441
There's someone back there.

01:27:50.287 --> 01:27:51.037
Back where?

01:27:51.367 --> 01:27:54.279
In the room.
I saw them moving.

01:28:00.047 --> 01:28:01.275
Where are you going?

01:28:03.087 --> 01:28:05.521
You said someone's back there.
I'll go check.

01:28:15.887 --> 01:28:17.036
There's nobody there.

01:28:17.607 --> 01:28:19.040
Who were you talking to?

01:28:19.207 --> 01:28:20.322
Nobody.

01:28:22.247 --> 01:28:23.202
Come on.

01:28:23.407 --> 01:28:24.522
Let go of me.

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:27.556
- Are you kidding me?
- Let me go.

01:28:28.447 --> 01:28:31.041
Don't follow me.
Stay there.

01:29:01.447 --> 01:29:02.721
Anybody sleepy?

01:29:05.527 --> 01:29:07.518
Anybody ready for bed?

01:29:08.727 --> 01:29:09.796
No.

01:29:10.167 --> 01:29:11.759
I never want to sleep again.

01:29:12.207 --> 01:29:14.801
I don't want to wake up
and be someone else.

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:19.046
Pick me up.

01:29:58.527 --> 01:30:00.085
Will you two marry me?

01:30:02.287 --> 01:30:03.561
I will.

01:30:04.807 --> 01:30:06.160
Will you, Manuel?

01:30:06.767 --> 01:30:07.961
I will too.

01:30:08.607 --> 01:30:10.165
Say yes.

01:30:11.927 --> 01:30:12.996
Yes.

01:30:16.967 --> 01:30:19.356
I love you both so much.

01:30:20.167 --> 01:30:21.361
So much.

01:30:32.047 --> 01:30:33.036
Slow down, Manuel.

01:30:33.207 --> 01:30:35.084
I can't go any slower,
I'm going 30mph.

01:30:35.247 --> 01:30:37.317
Stop, stop, wait a second.

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:40.916
Hold me.

01:30:55.847 --> 01:30:57.280
- Come here.
- No.

01:30:57.767 --> 01:30:59.917
You're my wife and I said come here.

01:31:00.367 --> 01:31:01.482
Come here.

01:31:03.767 --> 01:31:05.359
There's room for both of us.

01:31:07.487 --> 01:31:08.283
Look.

01:31:09.207 --> 01:31:10.686
I'll get rid of this.

01:31:12.207 --> 01:31:16.439
We don't need it.
We don't need a wastebasket

01:31:16.607 --> 01:31:18.723
to be a happy marriage, do we?

01:31:21.007 --> 01:31:22.565
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

01:31:25.887 --> 01:31:27.115
I said come here.

01:31:31.327 --> 01:31:32.601
You're my wife.

01:31:32.767 --> 01:31:33.882
Come here.

01:31:42.727 --> 01:31:44.285
I said come here.

01:31:45.007 --> 01:31:46.838
I said come here!

01:31:47.767 --> 01:31:50.406
Not like this, Manuel.
You're not like this.

01:31:53.767 --> 01:31:55.678
How do you know what I'm like?

01:31:58.407 --> 01:32:00.398
You have no fucking idea.

01:32:08.367 --> 01:32:09.482
Let me help you.

01:32:09.647 --> 01:32:10.636
No, I got it.

01:32:10.967 --> 01:32:13.879
- Don't be stupid.
- I said I fucking got it!

01:32:17.967 --> 01:32:20.242
You have no idea
who I am or who I'm not.

01:32:21.207 --> 01:32:22.560
You have no fucking idea.

01:32:40.367 --> 01:32:41.641
I'm sorry.

01:32:57.287 --> 01:33:00.006
- What are you looking for?
- My cell.

01:33:00.367 --> 01:33:03.165
It's gone. I can't find it.
I've lost it.

01:33:07.767 --> 01:33:09.519
- Let me.
- Don't touch me.

01:33:13.727 --> 01:33:15.445
- Let me.
- Don't touch me!

01:33:35.687 --> 01:33:36.802
May I?

01:33:52.407 --> 01:33:53.965
Nobody's called me.

01:33:58.927 --> 01:34:00.121
Don't worry.

01:34:00.847 --> 01:34:02.405
It's okay.

01:34:04.327 --> 01:34:05.885
Hold me tight, please.

01:34:07.727 --> 01:34:08.762
Tight.

01:34:09.367 --> 01:34:10.482
Tighter.

01:34:17.087 --> 01:34:18.566
It hurts.

01:34:19.207 --> 01:34:21.323
- Want me to let go?
- No, not you.

01:34:22.527 --> 01:34:23.960
It hurts.

01:34:25.447 --> 01:34:26.846
What hurts?

01:34:28.207 --> 01:34:29.401
I don't know,

01:34:29.567 --> 01:34:30.886
but it really hurts.

01:34:34.647 --> 01:34:36.000
Don't be afraid.

01:34:38.647 --> 01:34:40.080
Don't be afraid.

01:34:51.687 --> 01:34:53.166
Got any left?

01:34:53.887 --> 01:34:55.798
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

01:34:57.207 --> 01:34:58.276
Let me see.

01:35:01.007 --> 01:35:02.486
You're very pretty.

01:35:04.327 --> 01:35:08.400
Don't worry, my friend will give you
something to make you feel better.

01:35:09.807 --> 01:35:11.206
I think I could cry.

01:35:11.727 --> 01:35:12.955
Why?

01:35:13.407 --> 01:35:15.363
Because you're so nice to me.

01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:18.516
Don't be silly. Come here.
Don't cry.

01:35:18.687 --> 01:35:19.597
Hi.

01:35:22.847 --> 01:35:24.041
Want a shot?

01:35:28.247 --> 01:35:30.044
There's a lot more.

01:35:31.527 --> 01:35:33.085
Today is Neverland.

01:35:35.207 --> 01:35:37.675
Today is Neverland.

01:35:38.047 --> 01:35:40.686
Today is Neverland...

01:35:41.727 --> 01:35:43.240
Stop, you'll hurt yourself.

01:35:43.687 --> 01:35:44.756
You stop!

01:35:53.967 --> 01:35:55.400
Who...?

01:35:56.447 --> 01:35:58.403
Who are you?

01:35:59.287 --> 01:36:00.766
Who are you?

01:36:04.007 --> 01:36:05.201
Do I know you...

01:36:08.207 --> 01:36:09.765
or do I not know you?

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:40.796
Hi.

01:36:42.327 --> 01:36:43.316
Hi.

01:36:54.487 --> 01:36:56.364
Want me to stick it in?

01:36:57.007 --> 01:36:58.679
I have a huge cock.

01:37:01.127 --> 01:37:02.242
Like an elephant.

01:37:02.487 --> 01:37:04.398
Like a rhinoceros.

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:09.685
You want a cock?
I have a huge cock like a giraffe.

01:37:09.887 --> 01:37:11.878
- You want a cock?
- Julio, stop.

01:37:17.807 --> 01:37:19.559
Where can I stick it in?

01:37:20.407 --> 01:37:22.602
Where can I stick my huge cock?

01:37:23.527 --> 01:37:28.647
I bet you've never had
a cock like mine inside you.

01:37:28.847 --> 01:37:30.075
Julio, stop it!

01:37:31.127 --> 01:37:32.480
Leave her alone.

01:37:32.647 --> 01:37:33.716
Who are you?

01:37:34.887 --> 01:37:36.036
She said stop.

01:37:38.487 --> 01:37:39.681
And you?

01:37:41.807 --> 01:37:43.399
It's okay.

01:37:43.567 --> 01:37:45.637
Who are you?
I don't know you.

01:37:51.247 --> 01:37:53.044
Who are you guys?

01:37:55.807 --> 01:37:58.799
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:37:59.527 --> 01:38:01.040
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:38:01.207 --> 01:38:03.402
- Julio, go to bed.
- I'm not going to bed.

01:38:06.687 --> 01:38:08.200
You're in bad shape, Julio.

01:38:08.367 --> 01:38:09.482
No, I'm not!

01:38:12.847 --> 01:38:14.963
I'm not in bad shape.
I'm fine.

01:38:16.687 --> 01:38:17.915
I'm fine.

01:38:21.247 --> 01:38:22.362
I'm fine.

01:38:23.247 --> 01:38:24.362
I'm fine.

01:38:44.207 --> 01:38:45.435
You and you...

01:38:48.007 --> 01:38:51.238
You two are faggots.

01:38:54.247 --> 01:38:57.364
Faggots, both of you.
You two are faggots.

01:38:57.647 --> 01:39:00.559
You two are faggots
and you're a whore.

01:39:01.047 --> 01:39:03.003
A slut and a tease!

01:39:03.527 --> 01:39:07.406
You're a slut and a tease!

01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:42.484
It's my first time
with two guys.

01:39:49.527 --> 01:39:50.676
Wait.

01:39:53.727 --> 01:39:54.955
Slower.

01:39:55.127 --> 01:39:56.480
Relax.

01:39:58.607 --> 01:39:59.676
Come here.

01:40:16.367 --> 01:40:18.597
Come here.
Give me your cock.

01:40:20.567 --> 01:40:21.841
Give me your cock.

01:40:39.127 --> 01:40:40.560
You're not staying?

01:40:42.967 --> 01:40:44.241
I can't.

01:40:47.527 --> 01:40:48.880
Why not? It's early.

01:40:51.807 --> 01:40:53.001
I have to work.

01:40:55.487 --> 01:40:56.761
I'll take you.

01:40:58.047 --> 01:40:59.366
Really, I can't.

01:41:01.287 --> 01:41:02.959
Got a euro forthe bus?

01:41:05.807 --> 01:41:06.842
Yeah.

01:41:07.287 --> 01:41:09.721
In the jar on the washing machine.

01:42:22.807 --> 01:42:23.922
Niebla.

01:42:24.407 --> 01:42:25.556
Come here.
