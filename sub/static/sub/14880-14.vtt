00:00.033 --> 00:01.464
Previously
on <i>Covert Affairs...</i>

00:01.465 --> 00:05.007
Griffin Cole is his name.
He's ex-CIA.

00:05.107 --> 00:07.040
Griffin Cole now works
for this guy.

00:07.042 --> 00:10.643
Mossad is using us
to spy on Khalid, I'm sorry.

00:10.645 --> 00:12.278
We believe he's using a series
of charities as terror fronts.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.914
Khalid is dating an American.

00:14.916 --> 00:16.783
If I can turn her, I think
she can help us track him.

00:16.785 --> 00:19.284
And if this fails, we'll both
be testifying before Congress.

00:19.384 --> 00:20.650
The photos were doctored.

00:20.652 --> 00:22.686
Al Masri was never
at the compound.

00:22.688 --> 00:25.455
So we launched a drone strike
based on faulty intel.

00:25.457 --> 00:28.458
- Mossad played us.
- No, Eyal played you.

00:34.598 --> 00:36.366
- Auggie?
- You said you wanted to know

00:36.368 --> 00:37.867
when the storm clouds
were gathering.

00:37.869 --> 00:39.069
Well, they're gathering.

00:39.071 --> 00:41.304
- So the photo--
- Definitely doctored.

00:41.306 --> 00:42.972
It's all hands on deck now.

00:42.974 --> 00:44.474
Good find, by the way.

00:44.476 --> 00:46.643
I don't think it's quite time
for celebration.

00:46.645 --> 00:48.511
Listen, if anybody asks,
I'm on my way in.

00:48.513 --> 00:50.213
I just need to make
a quick stop first.

00:53.652 --> 00:55.251
- Hey. I'm with--
- I know.

00:55.253 --> 00:59.022
- I brought you coffee.
- I already got one.

01:01.258 --> 01:05.462
Megan? It's Annie.

01:22.313 --> 01:24.547
The view's not bad.

01:24.549 --> 01:26.683
I mean, I've definitely
seen worse.

01:26.685 --> 01:28.685
I haven't lived in a place
this devoid of character

01:28.687 --> 01:33.289
since I first moved to D.C.
it's depressing.

01:33.291 --> 01:38.328
I can assure you,
you won't be here for long.

01:38.330 --> 01:39.863
And for now,
at least you're safe.

01:39.865 --> 01:41.898
Yeah.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.901
Safe and stuck.
In a box.

01:44.903 --> 01:46.669
I sure hope it's all worth it,

01:46.671 --> 01:50.240
because right now, I'm not
seeing the value proposition.

01:50.242 --> 01:53.376
Is there anything else
that you need?

01:53.378 --> 01:58.248
Well, I have to give up
my job and my apartment

01:58.250 --> 02:01.117
and my boyfriend,
so the answer is yes.

02:01.119 --> 02:04.254
I need everything.

02:04.256 --> 02:08.425
I'm sorry.

02:08.426 --> 02:09.925
If there was any other way--

02:09.928 --> 02:11.828
You didn't tell me that you
needed to know where Khalid was

02:11.830 --> 02:13.897
so that you could drop
a missile on him.

02:21.872 --> 02:25.041
I know it's hard to accept...

02:25.043 --> 02:29.779
But right now this is the best
and safest place for you.

02:37.588 --> 02:40.223
Well, in that case...

02:40.225 --> 02:44.928
Next time,
I'll take it black.

02:51.969 --> 02:54.170
What? No.

02:54.172 --> 02:56.406
Oh, we're reexamining
everything.

02:56.408 --> 02:58.875
Even non-related cables.
Hang on a second.

02:58.877 --> 03:00.143
Did the DNA sweep
of the drone site come in?

03:00.145 --> 03:03.179
- Yes, sir.
- And?

03:03.181 --> 03:06.716
None of the KIAs
matched al Masri?

03:06.718 --> 03:09.285
Oh, Jesus.

03:09.287 --> 03:12.722
Phil, we're drilling down.

03:12.724 --> 03:15.992
I'll see you soon.

03:15.994 --> 03:17.527
They want to see me
in front of

03:17.529 --> 03:19.696
the senate intelligence
committee by noon sharp.

03:19.698 --> 03:20.897
Today?

03:20.899 --> 03:22.332
They've got recess
starting tomorrow,

03:22.334 --> 03:24.934
and they insisted on trying
to squeeze this in.

03:24.936 --> 03:26.302
That doesn't give us
time to prepare.

03:26.304 --> 03:28.638
Well that's just how
they like it.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.074
They don't trust us with enough
time to put together a story.

03:31.076 --> 03:35.211
You need to buy more time.

03:35.213 --> 03:39.215
Now you're
just as naive as Annie.

03:45.789 --> 03:48.191
- Is everyone still upstairs?
- Everyone that'll fit.

03:48.193 --> 03:50.460
That photo you uncovered
set off quite the fire alarm.

03:50.462 --> 03:51.728
It doesn't make any sense.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.763
Why would Israel
run up a false flag?

03:53.765 --> 03:55.365
In the short term,
they get what?

03:55.367 --> 03:57.967
They get us to drone Khalid.
They don't have that capability.

03:57.969 --> 03:59.135
Yeah, but think
of what they lose.

03:59.137 --> 04:01.371
Our cooperation, our trust,
our money.

04:01.373 --> 04:02.872
I can't believe Mossad
would do that.

04:02.874 --> 04:05.174
- You mean Eyal.
- I mean Mossad.

04:05.176 --> 04:09.512
Someone had to doctor
that intel.

04:09.514 --> 04:10.947
Well if I hadn't
forced it up the chain--

04:10.949 --> 04:12.682
Hey, you think you're
the first operative

04:12.684 --> 04:15.118
in this building
to come up short?

04:15.120 --> 04:16.319
We've all been there.

04:16.321 --> 04:18.421
You will bounce back
from this.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.890
I don't know.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.759
You didn't see how bad it got
with Joan last night.

04:22.761 --> 04:26.696
And that was before
the photo surfaced.

04:26.698 --> 04:30.033
Joan.
Uh, what's the status?

04:30.035 --> 04:32.335
Is there anything I can do?

04:32.337 --> 04:34.971
Not just yet.

04:34.973 --> 04:36.439
I can keep
working on Khalid.

04:36.441 --> 04:38.408
I can reach out to our assets
in the F.A.T.A.,

04:38.410 --> 04:40.777
and see if we can intercept him
before he leaves Pakistan.

04:40.779 --> 04:43.513
And I can forward her some key
contacts through Khyber house.

04:43.515 --> 04:45.682
You find him and then what?

04:45.684 --> 04:47.250
Regardless of what
those photos say,

04:47.252 --> 04:49.886
if Khalid is funding terrorists,
we still need to prove it.

04:49.888 --> 04:51.621
No one at Langley
is officially

04:51.623 --> 04:53.890
working on Khalid anymore.
Not until we get things

04:53.892 --> 04:55.258
squared up with
the intelligence committee.

04:55.260 --> 04:58.995
So what can I do?

05:01.899 --> 05:03.866
We curtailed
your debrief post-Russia,

05:03.868 --> 05:05.168
and that was our mistake.

05:05.170 --> 05:08.338
So you can go home,
pack up,

05:08.340 --> 05:12.275
and report back to Bluebonnet
by the end of the day.

05:12.277 --> 05:13.943
And I don't think
I need to say this,

05:13.945 --> 05:15.945
but I'm going to say it.

05:15.947 --> 05:19.649
Do not contact Eyal Lavin.

05:19.651 --> 05:23.786
Not until we get this
cleared up.

05:27.658 --> 05:31.094
- Back to Bluebonnet.
- You'll get through it.

05:31.096 --> 05:33.496
Wow.

05:33.498 --> 05:35.865
With all your quips
and witty rejoinders,

05:35.867 --> 05:38.134
that's the best
you can come up with?

05:38.136 --> 05:41.971
Mm.

06:20.978 --> 06:25.048
- Annie, don't you ever pick up?
- Eyal, now's not a good time.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.749
Yeah, well, either for me.
Come on, pull over.

06:26.751 --> 06:28.751
What?
Where are you?

06:28.753 --> 06:32.121
Just look in your rear-view,
will you?

06:42.066 --> 06:44.634
You know, normal people
have no problem just calling.

06:44.636 --> 06:46.703
I tried
like a dozen times.

06:46.705 --> 06:47.937
Okay, well,
we're not allowed

06:47.939 --> 06:49.338
to bring our cell phones
into Langley.

06:49.340 --> 06:50.606
God forbid something
urgent's happening.

06:50.608 --> 06:52.008
Something urgent
is happening.

06:52.010 --> 06:53.209
I know.
I'm trying to tell you.

06:53.211 --> 06:54.844
Did you know there was
false intel in that file

06:54.846 --> 06:56.379
when you gave it to me?

06:56.381 --> 06:57.480
What?

06:57.482 --> 06:58.815
The photos of al Masri
were doctored.

06:58.817 --> 07:00.349
Now what else
in that file is bogus?

07:00.351 --> 07:04.487
Everything in that file
was solid.

07:04.489 --> 07:07.356
Annie, I swear
on my son Avi's life

07:07.358 --> 07:12.095
that I had no knowledge of this.

07:12.097 --> 07:13.696
Well, we launched
a drone strike for nothing.

07:13.698 --> 07:15.765
Which makes what I'm about
to tell you even worse.

07:15.767 --> 07:18.434
We've intercepted calls
to Khalid's contact in Riyadh.

07:18.436 --> 07:19.936
We have it on good authority
that he plans

07:19.938 --> 07:24.474
on exacting vengeance
on the person who sold him out.

07:24.476 --> 07:26.375
Megan.

07:26.377 --> 07:28.778
I gotta go.
She might be in trouble.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.680
Has anyone tried to
get in here?

07:30.682 --> 07:32.048
We own the entire floor.

07:32.050 --> 07:34.383
No one's stepped foot
in this hallway besides you.

07:34.385 --> 07:37.620
Megan?
Open up, it's Annie.

07:37.622 --> 07:42.058
Megan!

07:42.060 --> 07:44.413
Megan?

no one got onto this floor

08:34.299 --> 08:37.368

And yet she's not here.

Her bag's still here.

08:38.881 --> 08:42.216
She was taken.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.551
Thank you.

08:43.553 --> 08:45.386
I had security download
the feeds from the cameras

08:45.388 --> 08:46.921
on both the south-
and east-facing streets.

08:46.923 --> 08:48.656
Good.

08:51.060 --> 08:54.628
- What are you looking for?
- I'll know when I see it.

09:02.572 --> 09:04.238
Don't tell me
you miss me already?

09:04.240 --> 09:05.739
I need a favor.

09:05.741 --> 09:08.375
Run down everything you
can find me on the license plate

09:08.377 --> 09:12.746
Maryland-Golf-Charlie-
Foxtrot-November 3-6-9.

09:12.748 --> 09:14.114
This doesn't sound
like information

09:14.116 --> 09:15.482
you need for a debriefing.

09:15.484 --> 09:18.419
I'm sorry, Auggie.

09:18.421 --> 09:19.854
I don't want to put you
in the position

09:19.856 --> 09:22.690
to have to cover for me.
I just...

09:22.692 --> 09:24.525
I don't want to run
anything else up the flagpole

09:24.527 --> 09:26.160
unless I know it's a flag.

09:26.162 --> 09:29.496
I'm gonna regret this,
aren't I?

09:33.468 --> 09:37.504
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.

09:37.506 --> 09:38.672
Just because you drive off

09:38.674 --> 09:40.541
doesn't mean
the conversation's over.

09:40.543 --> 09:41.842
You want to tell me
what's going on here?

09:41.844 --> 09:43.410
We were keeping
Megan Carr here

09:43.412 --> 09:45.179
to protect her
from retaliation.

09:45.181 --> 09:47.181
And?

09:47.183 --> 09:49.149
And she's gone.

09:49.151 --> 09:52.686
Oh, your CIA protection
wasn't very protective.

09:52.688 --> 09:55.122
- Remember this guy?
- Khalid's attack dog.

09:55.124 --> 09:56.390
Griffin Cole.

09:56.392 --> 09:57.591
He was spotted outside
the building

09:57.593 --> 10:00.194
at the same time Megan
went missing.

10:00.196 --> 10:01.929
This car was stolen,
and we traced the LoJack

10:01.931 --> 10:04.698
to West Virginia.
Pendleton county.

10:04.700 --> 10:05.900
I'll drive.

10:05.902 --> 10:08.769
Megan's my asset.

10:08.771 --> 10:10.237
This has nothing to do with you.

10:10.239 --> 10:13.707
And Griffin Cole poisoned
one of our assets.

10:13.709 --> 10:16.010
He's still a Mossad target.

10:16.012 --> 10:21.415
And I don't like
unfinished business

10:21.417 --> 10:25.552
I'll drive.

10:25.554 --> 10:28.989
We're on in three hours and
this is all you've come up with?

10:28.991 --> 10:32.159
It's not good enough.

10:32.161 --> 10:34.028
Okay, everybody,
let's just take a little break.

10:34.030 --> 10:35.162
Five minutes.

10:35.164 --> 10:39.233
Go stretch your legs,
get a coffee.

10:46.309 --> 10:49.810
You wanna talk about
what's really bothering you?

10:49.812 --> 10:52.146
What, the hearing's
not enough?

10:52.148 --> 10:53.847
One of these days,

10:53.849 --> 10:54.949
they're gonna dunk me
in the water

10:54.951 --> 10:57.217
and I won't come back up.

10:57.219 --> 10:58.686
Arthur, you've been called
to the Hill before,

10:58.688 --> 11:01.021
numerous times,
to defend your actions,

11:01.023 --> 11:02.556
and I've never seen you
rattled like this.

11:02.558 --> 11:04.024
You're going somewhere
with this.

11:04.026 --> 11:06.794
Last night I told you
I had a relapse.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.362
Ten minutes later,
we're dealing with this.

11:08.364 --> 11:10.531
I think it's safe to say
we left things unresolved.

11:10.533 --> 11:13.233
I just wanted to give you
the chance to talk it through,

11:13.235 --> 11:14.435
tell me how you were feeling.

11:14.437 --> 11:15.970
Well, we need to talk.

11:15.972 --> 11:18.639
But we've got these other
matters to deal with first.

11:18.641 --> 11:19.907
I'm sorry.
It's ok.

11:19.909 --> 11:21.508
No, listen,
the only reason we're scrambling

11:21.510 --> 11:24.545
for answers is because
I missed something.

11:24.547 --> 11:26.013
Arthur, you weren't
the only one.

11:26.015 --> 11:28.248
The whole agency was duped.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.818
No, it is my responsibility to
make sure the intel is airtight,

11:30.820 --> 11:34.521
and yesterday I failed to do so.
I overlooked something.

11:34.523 --> 11:36.123
How can you be so sure?

11:36.125 --> 11:38.826
Because Mossad would never
pull anything this risky

11:38.828 --> 11:41.628
without making sure
it would work.

11:41.630 --> 11:44.098
One doctored photo
does not ensure a drone strike.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.033
You know, it's hard to admit
we might have been fooled

11:46.035 --> 11:49.336
by such a simple tactic,
but what if we were?

11:49.338 --> 11:52.940
No, sorry.

11:52.942 --> 11:54.908
I don't buy it.

11:54.910 --> 11:56.343
All right, we're back in.

11:56.345 --> 11:58.479
Let's go, go, go!

11:58.481 --> 11:59.780
Auggie, the senate
intelligence committee

11:59.782 --> 12:01.315
has called Arthur
onto the carpet.

12:01.317 --> 12:04.151
He's gonna need some ammunition.
What kind of ammo?

12:04.153 --> 12:05.753
Well, there's no way Mossad
is going to admit

12:05.755 --> 12:08.022
to anything underhanded
in terms of those photographs,

12:08.024 --> 12:09.556
not without
some concrete evidence

12:09.558 --> 12:11.892
that they falsified the intel.
Concrete, huh?

12:11.894 --> 12:13.527
Well, it doesn't need
to stand up in a court of law.

12:13.529 --> 12:15.529
Understood.
Considering a blind guy's

12:15.531 --> 12:17.831
in charge of
a visual evidence investigation,

12:17.833 --> 12:20.100
chances of that are pretty slim.
What time is the hearing?

12:20.102 --> 12:21.235
Noon.

12:21.237 --> 12:22.636
There's an AIPAC
fund-raiser tonight,

12:22.638 --> 12:24.071
so Rivka's still in town.

12:24.073 --> 12:25.906
I'm gonna try to pull her
in here as soon as possible.

12:25.908 --> 12:29.276
Time is of the essence.
I'll get right on it.

12:38.453 --> 12:41.688
- Is this it?
- That's what it says.

12:53.134 --> 12:55.669
Since when do you carry a gun?

12:55.671 --> 12:58.338
Since I felt like
I needed one.

13:13.421 --> 13:18.392
It says it's in there.

13:18.394 --> 13:20.861
Doesn't make much sense.

13:20.863 --> 13:24.298
Taking this much effort
to dump a car, unless--

13:24.300 --> 13:26.100
Listen, why don't
you wait in the car?

13:26.102 --> 13:28.502
I can handle this.
No.

13:28.504 --> 13:33.073
If Megan's in there,
I want to go in.

14:28.530 --> 14:32.599
This doesn't feel right,
does it?

14:53.988 --> 14:56.523
Wait!

15:17.695 --> 15:19.572
You okay?

15:29.061 --> 15:30.900
I'm fine, Auggie.

15:31.308 --> 15:33.709
Surviving car bombs seems
to be a special skill of mine.

15:33.903 --> 15:36.069
Cole planting that explosive
was a message.

15:36.071 --> 15:38.505
He expected to be followed,
and there's no telling what else

15:38.507 --> 15:39.940
he'll do to keep you
off his trail.

15:40.126 --> 15:42.660
The only message I'm getting
is that he has Megan.

15:42.662 --> 15:44.462
- How do you know that?
- He had a picture of her.

15:44.464 --> 15:46.063
And there were two bottles
of water in the console.

15:46.065 --> 15:47.331
Both were drunk from.

15:47.333 --> 15:48.766
I'm gonna loop around
with NSA

15:48.768 --> 15:51.102
to check the cell tower
near where you found the car,

15:51.104 --> 15:53.437
see if Cole made any calls.
Thank you.

15:53.439 --> 15:56.674
- Yep.
- Is that her?

15:56.676 --> 16:00.111
- Yeah.
- Put her on speaker.

16:00.113 --> 16:03.180
Annie, you're on with Joan.

16:03.182 --> 16:04.381
Hi, Joan.

16:04.383 --> 16:05.850
- Annie, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

16:05.852 --> 16:09.453
But we--I promised
to protect Megan,

16:09.455 --> 16:10.821
and I'm not gonna
abandon her now.

16:10.823 --> 16:12.022
Well, Dexter called it in.

16:12.024 --> 16:14.191
We're mobilizing
a team to track down Cole.

16:14.193 --> 16:15.893
Mobilizing?
I'm already here!

16:15.895 --> 16:17.495
I can't be that far behind.

16:17.497 --> 16:19.830
Cole is on the run,
and he is getting sloppy

16:19.832 --> 16:21.265
because he knows
we're on his heels.

16:21.267 --> 16:23.501
We?

16:23.503 --> 16:25.503
I'm with Eyal.

16:25.505 --> 16:26.937
He was following me,

16:26.939 --> 16:29.440
and it would have cost too much
time to try and lose him.

16:29.442 --> 16:30.908
Joan, I am so close.

16:30.910 --> 16:35.212
I can feel it.
You know what?

16:35.214 --> 16:39.383
Do whatever you want to do.

16:44.122 --> 16:45.956
If you have something
to say to me,

16:45.958 --> 16:47.358
you'd better say it now.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.526
I know it hasn't
always been easy

16:48.528 --> 16:50.628
to get her to see things
a certain way.

16:50.630 --> 16:52.630
"Hasn't always been easy"?
Try impossible.

16:52.632 --> 16:54.965
Maybe sending her back
to Bluebonnet right now

16:54.967 --> 16:56.600
isn't the best idea.

16:56.602 --> 16:58.402
She needs to finish
her debrief, Auggie.

16:58.404 --> 16:59.937
You and I both know that
it's more than just a debrief.

16:59.939 --> 17:01.071
It's a punishment.

17:01.073 --> 17:02.473
At least that's how
it feels to her.

17:02.475 --> 17:04.175
Well she's right.
It is a punishment.

17:04.176 --> 17:06.944
Joan, everything Annie's done
since she got back from Russia

17:06.945 --> 17:09.547
hasn't been about
bucking your authority.

17:09.549 --> 17:11.281
She feels like
she's lost your respect.

17:11.284 --> 17:13.550
All she wants to do
is win that back.

17:13.553 --> 17:15.653
If you send her back
to Bluebonnet right now,

17:15.655 --> 17:18.556
you'll just be pushing her
further away.

17:18.558 --> 17:19.757
The paperwork's already
in the system.

17:19.759 --> 17:20.891
It's out of my hands.

17:20.893 --> 17:25.396
I don't believe that.

17:25.397 --> 17:27.897
Rivka's on her way in.

17:27.900 --> 17:31.335
I want the run-down on
those photos in five minutes.

17:31.337 --> 17:36.607
I'm on it.

17:36.609 --> 17:38.976
You all right?

17:38.978 --> 17:43.781
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:43.783 --> 17:46.083
You ever feel stuck?

17:46.085 --> 17:49.820
Like you can't move, no matter
what direction you go in?

17:49.822 --> 17:51.121
From time to time, yeah.

17:51.123 --> 17:52.423
What do you do about it?

17:52.425 --> 17:55.793
I come to west Virginia.

17:55.795 --> 17:57.595
Well, it usually works.
What, you're not feeling it?

18:01.067 --> 18:02.299
What is it?

18:02.301 --> 18:04.034
Auggie pulled a number off
a cell tower.

18:04.036 --> 18:08.072
Cole has a brother
five miles from here.

18:12.277 --> 18:14.144
The al Masri photo
was taken by satellite.

18:14.146 --> 18:15.779
Our goal was
to identify which one

18:15.781 --> 18:19.083
by determining which satellites
were in the area

18:19.085 --> 18:20.484
at the time it was taken.
Well, how many were there?

18:20.486 --> 18:22.219
About 200 operational.

18:22.221 --> 18:23.754
It's not a lot
when you consider

18:23.756 --> 18:25.756
there are roughly 13,000
in orbit.

18:25.758 --> 18:27.391
Some were ours,
some were China's,

18:27.393 --> 18:29.960
but the majority belonged
to various commercial entities,

18:29.962 --> 18:31.495
at least on paper.

18:31.497 --> 18:35.499
There were 12 whose ownership
we found to be suspect.

18:35.501 --> 18:37.034
Why is that?

18:37.036 --> 18:40.271
Because you don't use
an AES algorithm

18:40.273 --> 18:41.972
with a key length of 256

18:41.974 --> 18:44.608
just to stop people from
circumventing DiSEqC Protocols.

18:46.679 --> 18:48.279
Thank you for
the clarification, Barber.

18:48.281 --> 18:50.447
- You're welcome.
- Auggie?

18:50.449 --> 18:52.283
They're spy satellites
in disguise.

18:52.285 --> 18:54.485
That's exactly what
I just said.

18:54.487 --> 18:55.986
Ma'am.

18:55.988 --> 18:58.589
We were able to trace the
ownership of those satellites

18:58.591 --> 19:00.090
to the intelligence agencies

19:00.092 --> 19:03.460
of China, Germany,
Russia, and Israel.

19:03.462 --> 19:05.663
Can the al Masri photo be
linked back to the Israeli ones?

19:05.665 --> 19:08.732
Well, the Mossad satellites

19:08.734 --> 19:10.301
use a hidden layer
of protection.

19:10.303 --> 19:11.502
It's a brilliant protocol,

19:11.504 --> 19:12.736
one that we'd use
on our own satellites

19:12.738 --> 19:14.605
were it not for
its one vulnerability.

19:14.607 --> 19:17.107
- Which is?
- Flawed pixels in the images.

19:17.109 --> 19:19.209
You'd never notice it
just to look at the photo,

19:19.211 --> 19:23.781
but when you analyze it,
pixel by pixel, boom!

19:23.783 --> 19:27.351
Five microscopic nails
in Mossad's teeny tiny coffin.

19:27.353 --> 19:28.919
Rivka can deny it
all she wants,

19:28.921 --> 19:33.257
but the ones and zeroes
don't lie.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.526
Mm.

19:35.528 --> 19:36.894
Guy does demo.

19:36.896 --> 19:39.930
That's probably where Cole
got his explosives.

19:39.932 --> 19:41.632
You take the front door
and I'll take the back.

19:41.634 --> 19:43.233
If you're so eager
to get shot,

19:43.235 --> 19:44.702
why don't you take
the front door?

19:44.704 --> 19:46.503
We're two highly-trained
intelligence operatives.

19:46.505 --> 19:47.638
You don't think
we can get the drop

19:47.640 --> 19:49.540
on a contractor
with an NRA card?

19:49.542 --> 19:50.774
There's too much uncertainty.

19:50.776 --> 19:54.812
You saw what happened
at the storage facility.

19:54.814 --> 19:59.683
I have all the certainty
I need.

20:05.991 --> 20:08.492
Daniel Cole?

20:08.494 --> 20:09.860
Who's asking?

20:09.862 --> 20:11.795
Like to ask you a few
questions about your brother.

20:31.684 --> 20:32.850
Get up.

20:32.852 --> 20:37.187
Not a good start, Daniel.

20:40.458 --> 20:41.625
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

20:41.627 --> 20:43.060
Megan Carr.

20:43.062 --> 20:46.663
The woman your brother abducted.
I don't know any Megan.

20:46.665 --> 20:48.899
I haven't seen my brother
in two years.

20:48.901 --> 20:50.401
What about this morning...

20:50.403 --> 20:55.973
When you helped him plant
a bomb in a car?

20:55.975 --> 20:59.243
You want to change your answer?

20:59.245 --> 21:02.346
Who are you people?
FBI? ATF?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.548
You know, you can't just
come onto my property

21:04.550 --> 21:06.050
without cause and assault me.

21:06.052 --> 21:10.888
You gave him a vehicle,
didn't you, hmm?

21:10.890 --> 21:13.424
Where was he going?

21:13.426 --> 21:17.127
You wanna talk to me?
Bring a subpoena.

21:17.129 --> 21:19.496
We're wasting time.

21:19.498 --> 21:24.134
- Hey!
- Unh!

21:24.136 --> 21:26.170
- Go check the house.
- He's lying!

21:26.172 --> 21:31.208
Go check the house.
I'll watch him.

21:35.346 --> 21:36.847
Hey, you need to keep control
of that bitch

21:36.849 --> 21:37.848
or I swear I'm--

21:41.520 --> 21:45.322
What did you want
to say about her, hmm?

21:45.324 --> 21:47.224
See, I'm not American.

21:47.226 --> 21:49.426
I don't have to play
by the rules.

21:49.428 --> 21:51.662
I lent Griffin my four-by.

21:51.664 --> 21:53.230
He told me I could
pick it up later

21:53.232 --> 21:54.531
at the White Horse
air field.

21:54.533 --> 21:56.600
It's about 40 miles from here.

21:56.602 --> 21:57.734
What about the girl?

21:57.736 --> 21:59.369
I don't know anything
about a girl.

21:59.371 --> 22:04.374
I swear,
that's all I know.

22:05.877 --> 22:10.447
Unh.

22:13.252 --> 22:17.921
Unh!

22:27.122 --> 22:28.858
You want tell me what
that was all about?

22:30.567 --> 22:34.969
How else were we gonna get
that <i>kala</i> to talk?

22:38.540 --> 22:42.577
A couple of years ago
I was in Amsterdam.

22:42.982 --> 22:44.248
I was looking
to recruit someone

22:44.250 --> 22:46.750
to insert
into Khalid's organization.

22:46.752 --> 22:49.653
I found Johanna Peeters.

22:49.655 --> 22:50.854
From the moment I saw her,

22:50.856 --> 22:52.656
I knew there was
something special about her.

22:52.658 --> 22:57.227
She was beautiful, vibrant,
inquisitive, and educated.

22:57.229 --> 23:01.865
She was the perfect candidate
for recruitment.

23:01.867 --> 23:05.135
More importantly,
she was exactly Khalid's type.

23:05.137 --> 23:08.005
A natural, like you.

23:08.007 --> 23:11.041
The more I spent time with her,
the more I knew

23:11.043 --> 23:14.878
it would be impossible
to say good-bye to her.

23:14.880 --> 23:18.382
Eventually it was time for her
to start her mission.

23:18.384 --> 23:20.284
She infiltrated
Khalid's organization with ease,

23:20.286 --> 23:24.688
starting as a secretary
at one of his companies.

23:24.690 --> 23:28.392
Within months, she became
a flowing source of intel.

23:28.394 --> 23:30.794
And then suddenly, it stopped.

23:30.796 --> 23:33.030
We never found out
how she got discovered.

23:33.032 --> 23:36.233
One day Khalid
contacts Mossad with an offer.

23:36.235 --> 23:38.735
Find a way to get him off
of Mossad's target list

23:38.737 --> 23:41.271
in exchange
for Johanna's life.

23:41.273 --> 23:43.640
I thought he was bluffing.

23:43.642 --> 23:45.042
The next day,
her body was discovered

23:45.044 --> 23:48.245
in her houseboat
on the Herengracht.

23:48.247 --> 23:51.682
She was poisoned.

23:51.684 --> 23:53.950
Like Karina.

23:53.952 --> 23:59.089
Looks like it's Cole's M.O.

23:59.091 --> 24:00.791
If Johanna never met me,

24:00.793 --> 24:04.428
she'd still be teaching
somewhere in Amsterdam.

24:04.430 --> 24:09.366
But I persuaded her
to walk a different path.

24:09.368 --> 24:14.371
So, you see, I understand why
you feel obliged to find Megan.

24:21.112 --> 24:24.648
What evidence did you
have that al Masri

24:24.650 --> 24:26.016
was at the training camp?

24:26.018 --> 24:27.217
Well, we had
human intelligence

24:27.219 --> 24:28.719
from local tribal assets

24:28.721 --> 24:32.189
and culled communication cables.
We had visual documentation.

24:32.191 --> 24:33.990
When you say
"visual documentation,"

24:33.992 --> 24:35.492
you are referring to this photo?

24:35.494 --> 24:36.827
- Yes.
- A photo that has been

24:36.829 --> 24:39.463
determined to be corrupted?
Yes.

24:39.465 --> 24:41.331
If you know now
that the photo's been corrupted,

24:41.333 --> 24:44.267
how do you know that all
the other intel implicating

24:44.269 --> 24:46.136
Khalid Ansari isn't as well?

24:46.138 --> 24:47.504
We're drilling down
on everything.

24:47.506 --> 24:49.373
You're drilling down now?

24:49.375 --> 24:51.708
After you tried
to drop a bomb on the man?

24:51.710 --> 24:54.010
We did the best we could
with the time we had.

24:54.012 --> 24:57.013
Sometimes, the analysis
of evidence needs to be

24:57.015 --> 24:59.583
fast-tracked a little more
quickly than we'd like.

24:59.585 --> 25:02.786
We understand some of this
intelligence came from Mossad?

25:02.788 --> 25:05.522
What specifically did they
contribute that led you

25:05.524 --> 25:08.859
to believe Khalid Ansari
was funding terrorist groups?

25:08.861 --> 25:11.194
We have bank statements
indicating large donations

25:11.196 --> 25:13.430
to dummy charity organizations,

25:13.432 --> 25:16.967
like the benevolent
Red Crescent Society,

25:16.969 --> 25:21.605
Al Baramain, and the IIRG.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.573
And--

25:23.575 --> 25:25.175
Is that the extent
of the intelligence

25:25.177 --> 25:27.544
you've amassed
on Khalid Ansari's

25:27.546 --> 25:32.983
connection to terrorists?

25:32.985 --> 25:38.588
Mr. Campbell,
your response, please.

25:41.859 --> 25:45.529
My response...

25:45.531 --> 25:46.963
I don't have any more answers.

25:46.965 --> 25:48.799
I beg your pardon?

25:48.801 --> 25:49.966
This committee
summoned me here without

25:49.968 --> 25:51.234
adequate time to prepare.

25:51.236 --> 25:53.670
And now you're incredulous
when I can't

25:53.672 --> 25:55.405
deliver the proper information?

25:55.407 --> 25:57.374
It's absurd.

25:57.376 --> 26:01.678
You want the facts?
I need time to gather them.

26:01.680 --> 26:04.514
Are you requesting a recess,
Mr. Campbell?

26:04.516 --> 26:07.818
I don't believe
I've requested anything.

26:07.820 --> 26:10.787
This hearing will resume upon
our return from recess,

26:10.789 --> 26:12.422
two weeks from Monday.

26:12.424 --> 26:17.894
Perhaps Mr. Campbell
will be prepared by then.

26:17.896 --> 26:20.630
I want every scrap of intel
we have on Zamir Gerson.

26:20.632 --> 26:25.502
I mean everything.
Yes, sir.

26:25.504 --> 26:27.337
What you're looking at
is the evidence

26:27.339 --> 26:28.905
Arthur is presenting
right now

26:28.907 --> 26:32.075
to the senate
intelligence committee,

26:32.077 --> 26:36.379
proof that Mossad intentionally
fed the CIA falsified intel

26:36.381 --> 26:39.416
in order to have
Khalid Ansari killed.

26:39.418 --> 26:42.419
Israel's financial support
is going to get slashed

26:42.421 --> 26:44.321
if you continue to hold on
to the fiction

26:44.323 --> 26:48.225
that Mossad knew nothing
about the corrupted intel.

26:53.331 --> 26:56.967
I'm afraid I owe you
an apology...

26:56.969 --> 27:00.403
On behalf of my agency
and myself.

27:00.405 --> 27:02.072
Okay.

27:02.074 --> 27:05.575
New information has come
to light since last we spoke.

27:05.577 --> 27:08.712
And, um...

27:08.714 --> 27:09.913
I would like to share it
with you in an effort

27:09.915 --> 27:12.716
to repair the damage
that has been done.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.818
This entire Khalid Ansari affair

27:14.820 --> 27:18.822
represents a black eye
for Mossad.

27:18.824 --> 27:23.793
It turns out...you were not
the only ones who were duped.

27:36.041 --> 27:37.340
Hey, what's up?

27:37.342 --> 27:40.110
- Are you still with Eyal?
- Yeah, why?

27:40.112 --> 27:43.280
Can you slip away
for a few minutes?

27:43.282 --> 27:45.715
- Not really.
- All right, then just listen.

27:45.717 --> 27:47.951
Rivka is in the DPD.

27:47.953 --> 27:51.922
She says those photos were
doctored by Eyal, not Mossad.

27:54.592 --> 27:57.694
- What does that mean?
- It means, Eyal's gone rogue.

27:57.696 --> 28:00.497
He was too emotionally involved
in bringing in Khalid.

28:00.499 --> 28:02.599
It had something to do with
a woman in Holland.

28:02.601 --> 28:06.369
He tried to use his relationship
with you to get Khalid killed.

28:06.371 --> 28:07.871
Now he is
being decommissioned

28:07.873 --> 28:10.407
as a sign of good faith
between our agencies.

28:10.409 --> 28:11.575
That can't be true.

28:11.577 --> 28:14.744
There's solid evidence, Annie.

28:14.746 --> 28:18.181
Annie, you still there?
I have to go.

28:23.989 --> 28:26.022
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

28:26.024 --> 28:28.191
Hey, you want to tell me
what just happened here?

28:28.193 --> 28:31.895
What's going on with you?
Rivka's at Langley.

28:31.897 --> 28:33.096
She said you've gone rogue,

28:33.098 --> 28:35.131
that you doctored
the photos of al Masri.

28:35.133 --> 28:37.767
Not Mossad, you.

28:37.769 --> 28:39.202
Wait a minute,
wait a min--

28:39.204 --> 28:40.337
Rivka's at Langley?

28:40.339 --> 28:41.938
You wouldn't do that,
would you?

28:41.940 --> 28:43.540
You mean she's there
right now?

28:43.542 --> 28:45.342
I'm telling you
she just left Joan's office!

28:45.344 --> 28:50.380
Eyal, tell me that's not true!

28:52.850 --> 28:56.686
I'm sorry, Annie,
but it's true.

28:56.688 --> 28:58.822
You're lying.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.725
Annie, I did it.

29:01.727 --> 29:04.461
Mossad got caught pulling
a fast one on the CIA.

29:04.463 --> 29:07.230
And now you're taking one for
the team to smooth things over.

29:07.232 --> 29:09.833
You're sacrificing yourself
to protect them.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.601
You're wrong.

29:11.603 --> 29:16.439
I acted on my own.

29:20.611 --> 29:22.879
Was there no other way
to achieve what you wanted

29:22.881 --> 29:26.549
than by using me like this?

29:26.551 --> 29:28.718
I trusted you.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.887
I told you a long time ago
that there is no such thing

29:30.889 --> 29:33.189
as trust among spies.

29:33.191 --> 29:36.192
But you don't seem to get it.

29:36.194 --> 29:37.794
You know this thing
you keep doing,

29:37.796 --> 29:40.864
looking for the good in people?

29:40.866 --> 29:44.367
Not only does it make you weak,
it makes you a target.

29:44.369 --> 29:48.371
And an easy one at that.

29:52.309 --> 29:57.080
Annie, come on!

30:43.775 --> 30:46.909
Open the hatch!
Open it!

30:51.893 --> 30:57.365
Get out of here.

31:32.768 --> 31:34.168
Drop it.

31:34.170 --> 31:38.606
Drop it!

31:42.345 --> 31:45.112
- Where's Megan?
- I don't have her.

31:45.114 --> 31:47.281
You came to the safe house
and got her.

31:47.283 --> 31:48.549
I saw you.

31:48.551 --> 31:50.284
No, I just stopped
to give her a plane ticket

31:50.286 --> 31:51.619
and a fake passport.

31:51.621 --> 31:56.490
- She went to Khalid?
- Call me a decoy.

32:02.831 --> 32:05.533
Drop it, Cole!

32:05.535 --> 32:08.469
Take the shot!

32:19.881 --> 32:22.650
Thanks.

32:27.189 --> 32:28.422
- Auggie, hey.
- Hey.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.391
Thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.

32:30.393 --> 32:31.659
Oh, that's all right.

32:31.661 --> 32:33.694
Listen, I don't have
a lot of time actually.

32:33.696 --> 32:35.696
I've gotta get back to work.
But how can I help you?

32:35.698 --> 32:36.964
You can join us
on the next tour

32:36.966 --> 32:38.132
of Operation Proper Exit,
Captain Anderson.

32:38.134 --> 32:40.568
That would be
a tremendous help.

32:40.570 --> 32:42.670
Did your voice suddenly
drop an octave, Kip,

32:42.672 --> 32:44.038
or did you bring a friend?

32:44.040 --> 32:45.673
Sorry, Auggie, this is--

32:45.675 --> 32:48.175
Major James Wylde.
13th Corps support command.

32:48.177 --> 32:50.444
August Anderson, sir.

32:50.446 --> 32:51.745
Sergeant Harbor here
tells me you're interested

32:51.747 --> 32:53.581
in volunteering your time
for our program.

32:53.583 --> 32:57.218
Uh, well, I said
I would look into it.

32:57.220 --> 33:01.088
He gave me a brochure to read.
Well, I can answer

33:01.090 --> 33:02.756
any questions you might have
right now.

33:02.758 --> 33:04.425
All right, here's one.

33:04.427 --> 33:05.893
What's with
the full court press?

33:05.895 --> 33:09.563
I just had a battle buddy
drop out at the last minute.

33:09.565 --> 33:11.866
He and his wife
are expecting their first.

33:11.868 --> 33:13.100
Anyway, I'm short an officer
and I need you.

33:14.237 --> 33:15.369
We're shipping out
in ten days.

33:15.371 --> 33:16.937
- Ten days?
- Right.

33:16.939 --> 33:18.639
You'll need to get up-to-date
on your vaccinations

33:18.641 --> 33:20.141
and, if your blues aren't
fitting like they used to,

33:20.143 --> 33:21.342
you'll need
to have them altered.

33:21.344 --> 33:24.245
Listen, I'm honored, really.

33:24.247 --> 33:26.680
But my inbox is piled
so high even if I hadn't

33:26.682 --> 33:29.783
lost my vision, I wouldn't
be able to see my desk.

33:29.785 --> 33:31.318
You lost something
very valuable in combat, son.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.220
And you've managed
to rise above.

33:33.222 --> 33:35.656
You'd be a great inspiration
to your fellow warriors.

33:35.658 --> 33:37.491
I've been out of uniform
more than five years.

33:37.493 --> 33:40.394
You are not duty-bound.

33:40.396 --> 33:43.497
But I'll need an answer
by the beginning of next week.

33:43.499 --> 33:47.067
Kip knows how to reach me.

33:47.069 --> 33:49.069
Thanks for the ambush, buddy.

33:49.071 --> 33:52.773
Well, come on,
he said you're not duty-bound.

33:55.577 --> 33:58.979
Maybe you're right.

33:58.981 --> 34:02.082
Maybe I am naive.

34:02.084 --> 34:06.720
Maybe I need to grow
a thicker skin, but...

34:06.722 --> 34:09.422
I'm still having trouble
believing you would give me

34:09.425 --> 34:13.092
doctored photos,
knowing what would happen.

34:13.094 --> 34:16.797
Given all we've been through?

34:16.799 --> 34:19.033
What are you saying, Annie?

34:19.034 --> 34:20.400
I'm saying I'm giving you
one last chance

34:20.402 --> 34:24.304
to save our friendship.

34:24.306 --> 34:28.275
There's nothing I can say.

34:53.123 --> 34:54.291
Anything?

34:54.293 --> 34:55.826
Oh, not yet.

34:55.828 --> 34:57.728
Did you get ahold
of Rivka again?

34:57.730 --> 35:00.531
Despite her offer to repair
the bond between our agencies,

35:00.533 --> 35:02.566
she seems to have returned
to her former policy

35:02.568 --> 35:06.470
of ducking my calls.
Oh, I need a break.

35:06.472 --> 35:09.273
Wanna get some dinner?
Sure.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.342
There's just something I wanted
to talk to you about first.

35:11.344 --> 35:13.043
What is it?

35:13.045 --> 35:15.179
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said

35:15.181 --> 35:19.083
about taking responsibility
for acting on the false intel.

35:19.085 --> 35:20.451
You got the intel
because Annie felt

35:20.453 --> 35:21.685
the need to go above my head.

35:21.687 --> 35:26.657
- Oh, that's not your fault.
- I think it is.

35:26.659 --> 35:27.825
I think I've lost control

35:27.827 --> 35:29.527
of my department
and my operatives

35:29.529 --> 35:31.362
because I haven't been
the leader that they needed.

35:31.364 --> 35:34.031
Why is that?

35:34.033 --> 35:37.535
I've set a poor example
of how to do this job.

35:37.537 --> 35:40.137
I work weekends,
and holidays,

35:40.139 --> 35:42.172
three anniversaries
in a row.

35:42.174 --> 35:45.042
And I expect the same
from them.

35:45.044 --> 35:48.112
And I've done
some great work,

35:48.114 --> 35:51.215
but I've also run myself
into the ground.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.449
I think I've finally
come to realize

35:52.451 --> 35:55.386
that doing this job
doesn't mean doing it

35:55.388 --> 36:00.758
to the exclusion
of everything else in my life.

36:00.760 --> 36:04.862
Well...

36:04.864 --> 36:07.398
What do you want to do
about it?

36:07.400 --> 36:11.068
Something that I have
never done before.

36:11.070 --> 36:14.438
Take a few days off,
starting now.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.607
Oh, I totally support that.

36:16.609 --> 36:21.211
- You do?
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.846
Thank you.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.482
Sorry to interrupt, sir,

36:25.484 --> 36:27.151
but I thought you'd want
to know right away.

36:27.153 --> 36:28.319
Henry Wilcox's sentence

36:28.321 --> 36:31.155
is in the process
of being commuted.

36:31.157 --> 36:33.624
- What?
- How did this happen?

36:33.626 --> 36:36.160
That's all the information
we have at the moment.

36:36.162 --> 36:39.597
Should I get the DCI
on the phone?

36:42.167 --> 36:44.535
Midge, call Petersburg Prison
and tell them I want

36:44.537 --> 36:49.206
a sit-down with Henry Wilcox
as soon as possible.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.930
That I acted alone.

37:12.932 --> 37:14.765
That's what I was supposed
to do, wasn't it?

37:14.767 --> 37:16.200
We had no choice.

37:16.202 --> 37:20.471
It had to be done.

37:20.473 --> 37:23.140
"By way of deception,
thou shalt do war."

37:25.777 --> 37:27.778
Eyal, you had
a role to play here.

37:27.780 --> 37:31.315
For Mossad.
For Eretz Israel.

37:31.317 --> 37:33.651
Annie trusted me.
Completely.

37:33.653 --> 37:36.353
Yes.
That was the point.

37:36.355 --> 37:41.458
That's all over.
I'm finished here.

37:44.429 --> 37:45.863
What now?

37:45.865 --> 37:49.099
Now you go to Tel Aviv.

37:49.101 --> 37:51.568
We'll find a desk for you.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.671
I don't think so.

37:53.673 --> 37:57.141
You don't think so?

37:57.143 --> 37:59.243
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

37:59.245 --> 38:00.678
It means I quit.

38:03.549 --> 38:06.917
I've done some...foolish,

38:06.919 --> 38:11.021
dangerous, questionable things
for Mossad--for you.

38:13.224 --> 38:19.229
But this--
this crossed a line.

38:19.231 --> 38:22.332
Don't forget which side
of the line this woman is on.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.835
I trusted her.

38:24.837 --> 38:27.204
She saved my life five times,

38:27.206 --> 38:29.273
even though
she only counts three.

38:29.275 --> 38:31.108
Listen to me.

38:31.110 --> 38:34.044
What is happening here
is much larger than you know.

38:34.046 --> 38:38.315
We've all had to play
our parts.

38:38.317 --> 38:41.685
We've all had to pay
the price.

38:41.687 --> 38:45.689
Yeah, what--what have you lost
in this grandiose scheme, hmm?

38:48.159 --> 38:51.161
You.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.377
Hey, you're still here.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.846
Yeah, I'm on my way
to Bluebonnet right now.

39:08.848 --> 39:11.014
I just had
to finish some emails.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.516
What's that?

39:12.518 --> 39:15.219
This is an old army blanket
of mine I was gonna give you

39:15.221 --> 39:16.687
if you were still going
to Bluebonnet.

39:16.689 --> 39:17.821
I don't understand.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.323
Eh, it gets cold
up there at night.

39:19.325 --> 39:20.924
The rooms aren't
very well insulated.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.292
This helps with that.

39:22.294 --> 39:23.894
Haven't you ever
been camping?

39:23.896 --> 39:26.296
I mean, I don't understand
about me not going?

39:26.298 --> 39:28.398
Oh, yeah, I buried the lead
on that one.

39:28.400 --> 39:32.703
You don't have to go back
to Bluebonnet for debrief.

39:34.106 --> 39:37.875
Auggie...

39:37.877 --> 39:41.311
I don't know how you did it,
but I cannot thank you enough.

39:41.313 --> 39:42.713
Actually,
I didn't do a thing.

39:42.715 --> 39:44.414
Up until about
ten minutes ago,

39:44.416 --> 39:48.585
I still thought
you were going.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.588
Joan? Why?

39:51.590 --> 39:53.223
I thought she couldn't wait
to get me out of her hair

39:53.225 --> 39:54.725
for a while.

39:54.727 --> 39:58.462
Maybe she realized
she likes you too.

39:58.464 --> 40:01.465
Too?

40:03.201 --> 40:05.402
Thank you.

40:09.574 --> 40:13.277
That's a nice blanket.
Looks...really cozy.

40:13.279 --> 40:15.946
Here.

40:39.137 --> 40:43.407
I am sorry about the way
you had to get here.

40:43.409 --> 40:48.212
Fake documents,
sneaking out of that apartment,

40:48.214 --> 40:50.414
all the secrecy.

40:50.416 --> 40:55.018
It was a long trip.

40:55.020 --> 40:58.322
But worth it, I hope.

40:58.324 --> 41:01.325
I'm glad you could
explain everything.

41:01.327 --> 41:06.029
I was just so confused.

41:06.031 --> 41:09.733
They wanted to scare you
into turning against me.

41:09.735 --> 41:15.205
That is how
the CIA operates.

41:15.207 --> 41:19.843
The important thing
is we're together again.

41:28.453 --> 41:31.989
Now, tell me again about
the woman who approached you.

41:31.991 --> 41:36.093
Annie.
Her name is Annie Walker.
