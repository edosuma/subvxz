- How's it goin'?
- l have no idea who you are.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.999
What's up, dude?

00:43.168 --> 00:45.712
<i>Wait a second. He's dating Carla.</i>

00:45.796 --> 00:48.215
<i>This is not good.</i>

00:50.676 --> 00:53.220
First, l already told her
l got a girlfriend.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.473
Second, you just put
your bare lips on my ear.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.017
- How's it going? l'm...
- JD, l know.

00:59.101 --> 01:02.020
He won't stop talking about you.
l'm Jennifer.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.651
Do you really spend every day
saving children's lives?

01:07.734 --> 01:09.695
Tell the nice lady.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.656
l do what l can.

01:12.739 --> 01:16.243
lt's on! lt's on.

01:16.326 --> 01:20.455
<i>- lt's on!
- Oh, yeah.</i>

01:20.539 --> 01:22.749
<i>I know two things about bars.</i>

01:22.833 --> 01:25.127
<i>One, they're packed
Thanksgiving week.</i>

01:25.210 --> 01:27.754
<i>Two, put a beer in my hand
and I'm Mr Smooth.</i>

01:27.838 --> 01:31.925
l was laughing so hard,
milk was coming out of my nose.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.763
l once tripped over an lV
and blood shot over everyone.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.311
A little got on my nose.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.938
Every damn day, saving those children.

01:45.022 --> 01:48.817
Who wants margaritas?!
Dude, less blood, more fruity drinks.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.194
Right.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.447
<i>Turk hasn't changed a bit since college.</i>

01:53.530 --> 01:56.408
<i>He's the same goof ball
who tells me how to be cooler.</i>

01:56.491 --> 01:57.910
Dude.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.998
- This girl's hot. So don't blow it.
- Why do you say that?

02:03.081 --> 02:07.002
Because you're like a 24-hour
convenience store. You never close.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.713
That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.971
Don't worry about it, l feel good
tonight, know what l'm saying?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.223
Good.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.892
Except for this stabbing pain
in my side.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.687
Up all night with a high fever,
cramping and crying.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.272
- Dude!
- My bad.

02:27.356 --> 02:32.319
Not crying, punching the wall all manly
and angry like, you know what l mean?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.488
See ya later, buddy.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.742
Poor Bambi. Don't worry.
Carla will take care of you.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.496
- Make sure he's admitted right away.
- All right.

02:42.579 --> 02:46.834
<i>On the bright side, it'll be interesting
to see what it's like to be a patient.</i>

02:46.917 --> 02:49.211
You know people die here?

02:50.754 --> 02:52.047
You're a good friend.

02:52.130 --> 02:55.133
l do what l can.
Can l have your stuff?

03:11.775 --> 03:14.027
So did you talk to any girls last night?

03:14.111 --> 03:16.446
l'm an attractive man,
we both know this.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.991
lt's a burden
you're gonna have to live with.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.034
One of many.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.538
JD talked some girl up.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.999
Really? Are you gonna call her?

03:30.169 --> 03:32.588
Not right away.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.215
Showtime.
Clear out so l can check him out.

03:36.592 --> 03:40.888
You're examining me? l don't want you
to see my unmentionables.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.681
l've seen underwear before.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.059
l use the word unmentionables
for my genitals as well.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.189
68-year-old male
with respiratory distress...

03:50.272 --> 03:51.690
Save your breath.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.360
Hello, Dad.

03:55.444 --> 03:59.114
Never thought you'd call me that again,
after l left.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.161
- Dr Cox!
- Relax, Carla.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.538
The man l'm smothering
isn't my father.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.999
Dr Benson used to be
Chief of Medicine here.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.376
Hi, how are you?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.343
Still have that great rapport
with the nurses?

04:19.426 --> 04:24.097
Carla totally gets me. That's why l've
systematically tried to drive her away.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.350
Ever see that therapist l recommended?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.810
Not yet, no.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.441
Shortness of breath? Dizziness?
Problems urinating?

04:34.525 --> 04:38.278
No. No...
ls it a problem if it whistles?

04:38.362 --> 04:42.324
You're making this so much easier.
Are you sexually active?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.493
lt's active.

04:44.576 --> 04:48.163
l'll write ''rare dry spell''
in the margin.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.958
OK, time for the physical.

04:53.752 --> 04:57.464
Cold hands.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.258
Suck it up!

05:01.510 --> 05:06.265
<i>Elliot's exam was reminiscent of when my
older brother beat the crap out of me.</i>

05:07.641 --> 05:08.725
God!

05:08.809 --> 05:11.937
See, it wasn't so bad. All done.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.024
l'm puking every hour
and my fever's high,

05:16.108 --> 05:18.569
but you're sure it's OK
for me to be out of bed?

05:18.652 --> 05:22.364
l don't know. Dr Benson was my mentor.
Don't do that annoying thing.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.616
- What annoying thing?
- When you talk.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.742
Come on.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.704
- Does that not drive you crazy?
- You get used to it.

05:28.787 --> 05:32.749
l know you're excited with the gown on
but at no time are you to curtsy.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.919
<i>He can say what he wants.
but he's showing me off.</i>

05:36.003 --> 05:37.171
Dr Benson.

05:37.254 --> 05:41.383
Just give us a second, will ya, big guy?
Did you hear about her?

05:41.466 --> 05:44.469
<i>Watching Dr Cox,
I realised we never really stop</i>

05:44.553 --> 05:47.931
<i>craving the attention
of people we look up to.</i>

05:55.606 --> 05:58.233
Any questions?

05:59.234 --> 06:00.569
Good.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.740
- He seemed nice.
- Careful, Newbie.

06:04.823 --> 06:08.202
l'm hearing it now.
lt is kind of annoying when l talk.

06:08.285 --> 06:12.372
<i>In a lot of relationships, you regress
to the person you were when you met.</i>

06:12.456 --> 06:14.875
So Elliot's exam was that bad?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.252
- Dude, she violated me.
- ln a good way?

06:17.336 --> 06:19.004
What's the deal?

06:19.087 --> 06:20.964
l think l broke my ass!

06:21.048 --> 06:23.300
You're telling everyone l violated you.

06:23.383 --> 06:28.138
Not everyone, just the people
that work here. And my parents.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.557
Was there something wrong
with my exam?

06:30.641 --> 06:33.769
<i>So there it is. The classic trap.
Two choices.</i>

06:33.852 --> 06:37.439
<i>Either wuss out
or tell the truth.</i>

06:37.523 --> 06:39.399
You're kinda rough.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.986
You're rough and
you're a little businesslike.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.197
- You're cold.
- You mean my hands?

06:45.280 --> 06:48.867
Yeah, those too. l just think
you could be more comforting.

06:48.951 --> 06:52.496
<i>I could tell she appreciated
how hard it was for me to say that.</i>

06:52.579 --> 06:55.374
Do you know how annoying
you are when you talk?

06:55.457 --> 06:56.917
<i>Maybe not.</i>

06:59.962 --> 07:03.632
- l was watching that.
- lt's broken.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.514
Dr Cox. Did you get my memo
reminding senior staff

07:10.597 --> 07:13.183
that lab coats
must be worn at all times?

07:13.267 --> 07:17.396
You know, l did get it, Bob,
and at first l just threw it away,

07:17.479 --> 07:20.607
but then l decided that
wasn't a grand enough gesture.

07:20.691 --> 07:23.277
So l made a replica of you
out of straw

07:23.360 --> 07:27.072
and then l put my lab coat on it
with your memo in the pocket,

07:27.155 --> 07:29.241
then invited the neighbourhood kids

07:29.324 --> 07:32.077
to light it on fire
and whack it with sticks.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.790
So, l have been looking
at Dr Benson's chart.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.042
His chest x-ray was normal,

07:39.126 --> 07:44.047
his vitals are stable,
so let's discharge him.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.341
Now hold the phone there, skipper.

07:46.425 --> 07:51.680
Dr Benson should be able to stay here
until he feels he's ready to go.

07:51.763 --> 07:55.267
Give me a break, he was
only Chief of Medicine for ten years.

07:55.350 --> 08:00.230
Well, l haven't had my coffee yet,
so l'm finding it hard coming up with

08:00.314 --> 08:03.775
a more colourful way to say
''Who gives a crap?''

08:06.028 --> 08:08.488
Actually, that wasn't half bad.

08:10.449 --> 08:13.493
Our next patient
is a 26-year-old male

08:13.577 --> 08:17.873
who has presented vomiting,
abdominal cramps and fever.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.792
<i>I never realised how hard
rounds are on the patient.</i>

08:20.876 --> 08:22.961
<i>It feels like you're on display.</i>

08:23.045 --> 08:26.798
Still, Rodin's masterpiece
makes us wonder,

08:26.882 --> 08:30.010
why didn't he spend
a little less time thinking

08:30.093 --> 08:32.429
and a little more time at the gym?

08:33.722 --> 08:35.682
l do cardio.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.686
Which most likely indicates what,
Dr Reid?

08:39.770 --> 08:42.022
He has a simple case
of appendicitis.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.316
How would you proceed,
Dr Dorian?

08:44.399 --> 08:48.987
l would give me that news in private,
no matter how angry l was at me.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.949
Sounds like there's a
fascinating back story here.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.660
Turf him to surgery. Moving on.

08:55.702 --> 08:59.373
Watch it, Bambi. You don't want
a 1 00lb white girl mad at you.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.167
You'll flinch every time
you hear a Range Rover.

09:02.251 --> 09:05.295
l can't believe l have to
spend all Thanksgiving here.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.632
- Tell me that wouldn't kill you.
- Not really.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.635
Do they celebrate Thanksgiving
in your homeland?

09:11.718 --> 09:15.848
- You mean Chicago?
- You have a Chicago?

09:15.931 --> 09:17.975
Be nice to me. l'm getting surgery.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.812
- Dr Wen is the attending.
- Who's the intern doing the work?

09:21.895 --> 09:26.900
<i>I get to cut you open
I get to cut you open</i>

09:33.115 --> 09:34.575
Go, girl!

09:34.658 --> 09:36.493
Go get it.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.540
<i>Good God.</i>

09:41.623 --> 09:44.376
Mr Davis,
you won't be home for Thanksgiving

09:44.459 --> 09:47.004
but you'll be eating leftovers
by Saturday.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.339
Great. And doctor, thank you so much.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.425
You're welcome.

09:53.010 --> 09:56.680
We've gotten to know each other
over the last week, haven't we?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.056
l'd say so.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.100
You found me comforting?

10:00.184 --> 10:02.019
God, no.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.854
l'm pretty good with people.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.856
- You're horrible.
- l'm warm.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.109
You're very cold. l mean, your hands...

10:09.193 --> 10:12.362
- lt's like you're a yeti.
- l have bad circulation.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.948
l do this all day and it doesn't help.

10:15.032 --> 10:19.161
Listen, sweetie, you're
a very efficient, competent doctor.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.831
But your exams...
Do you examine everyone like that

10:22.915 --> 10:26.126
or just people you feel
have wronged you in some way?

10:26.210 --> 10:29.129
- l appreciate your opinion.
- lt's not an opinion.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.548
You see those guys right there?

10:31.632 --> 10:35.010
They're pretending to be asleep
so you won't manhandle them.

10:35.093 --> 10:38.305
- They are not.
- Dude, what are you doing?

10:39.306 --> 10:40.974
Too frank, right?

10:41.058 --> 10:45.395
l know. lt's probably why my mom
pushed me down the stairs.

10:45.479 --> 10:49.233
She is fat, though. And boring.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.027
BP's 60 over palp.
ls he having a heart attack?

10:52.110 --> 10:55.489
lt's hypotension and
electrical alternance on the monitor.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.491
This is tamponade.

10:57.574 --> 11:02.162
Viral infections can cause pericarditis
and a rapid accumulation of fluid.

11:02.246 --> 11:05.332
lt looks like a heart attack
but don't let it fool you.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.543
BP's stabilizing.

11:07.626 --> 11:11.046
- What have we got?
- Don't worry. We're fine here.

11:11.129 --> 11:15.050
<i>It's a universal feeling to want
to be there for a good friend.</i>

11:15.133 --> 11:18.929
<i>So from now on, I'm going to stop
seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother.</i>

11:19.012 --> 11:20.347
Dr Turk, if you will?

11:20.430 --> 11:24.059
We'll mark for the incision
right about here.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.646
<i>After all, he's a highly trained,
competent young doctor.</i>

11:27.729 --> 11:29.273
Dude!

11:29.356 --> 11:34.069
l'm about to bust a mad
sliz-ice in your insides!

11:36.238 --> 11:40.117
Sir, l'd prefer if someone other
than Dr Turk performed the surgery.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.785
Fair enough.

11:41.869 --> 11:45.956
Dr Cotter will perform
the procedure tomorrow morning.

11:52.921 --> 11:56.800
<i>The best thing about friends is how
quickly things like this blow over.</i>

11:56.925 --> 12:00.971
- You understand, right?
- Whatever, man.

12:01.096 --> 12:04.558
You want some salsa
for that chip on your shoulder?

12:04.641 --> 12:09.104
l can't believe you. l would never ever
do something like this to you.

12:09.188 --> 12:12.316
- You're like school in July.
- What do you mean?

12:12.399 --> 12:13.901
No class.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.869
You're not supposed
to scare me like that, sir.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.372
lt was just a prank.
Admittedly, l took it too far.

12:27.456 --> 12:30.292
Well, l still laughed, but...

12:30.375 --> 12:33.378
l felt a little guilty
l wasn't here administering...

12:33.462 --> 12:36.882
l just came to check on
my favourite patient.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.176
l must have the wrong room.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.553
- How are you, Dave?
- l'm doing great, Bob.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.055
l owe you one.

12:43.138 --> 12:46.141
Hey, doc, you should
go ahead and get some rest.

12:46.225 --> 12:48.060
l'll be out of your hair soon.

12:48.143 --> 12:53.815
Just a sec, skipper. You'll stay here
until you decide you're ready to leave.

12:53.899 --> 12:58.862
For God's sake, you were the Chief
of Medicine here for over ten years.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.781
Am l right?

13:04.618 --> 13:06.787
That was what l said this morning.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.997
Yeah, it sounded familiar.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.547
- What?
- l was wondering

13:16.630 --> 13:19.383
how you comb your hair
so the horns don't show?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.552
l wonder what bothers you the most?

13:21.635 --> 13:24.763
ls it that l saved his life
and he likes me as a person?

13:24.847 --> 13:27.307
l bet it's how much
he respects me as a doctor.

13:27.391 --> 13:30.686
How does that taste?
Bitter? Hard to get down?

13:37.192 --> 13:39.278
- Here you go.
- Great.

13:39.361 --> 13:42.573
Carla, everyone likes you so much,
it makes me wonder...

13:42.656 --> 13:46.118
- Why patients think you're a cold fish?
- My God, you noticed?

13:46.201 --> 13:50.205
- Honey, they told me.
- Great. lf anyone needs me,

13:50.289 --> 13:53.041
l'll be in the supply closet
eating sugar packets.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.043
Look, Elliot...

13:56.795 --> 14:00.591
l'm not the kind of person who likes
telling people what to do, but...

14:00.674 --> 14:04.636
Here's what to do. Here's what l think.
Here's what your problem is.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.097
Don't think of your patients
as strangers.

14:07.181 --> 14:10.517
l'm dating Turk, l get it.
Sometimes he is a big kid.

14:10.601 --> 14:14.563
But when it comes to work, he's
as capable and mature as anyone.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.149
Take those out.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.151
Baby, l was being a walrus.

14:19.234 --> 14:23.614
JD's not only your friend
but a patient too, and he's scared.

14:23.697 --> 14:28.160
Kelso is pushing your buttons.
Every now and then let something go.

14:28.243 --> 14:32.247
Turk's not that mature. He spent
all yesterday being a walrus.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.666
He had straws and stuff...

14:34.750 --> 14:38.086
The only thing
JD's scared of is sharks.

14:38.170 --> 14:42.341
And he has a weird thing with pennies.
He's not scared about this.

14:42.424 --> 14:47.554
Kelso's not just some harmless
guy pushing my buttons, Carla.

14:47.638 --> 14:48.972
He's a pod person.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.600
- You're wrong.
- You're so wrong.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.811
<i>Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong</i>

14:58.023 --> 15:00.859
<i>You're wrong.</i>

15:04.029 --> 15:07.533
l think you're right. l don't know
how to connect with patients.

15:07.616 --> 15:12.246
Start by touching them, holding
their hand, or stroking their hair,

15:12.329 --> 15:14.540
or give them
a reassuring pat on the arm.

15:14.623 --> 15:18.293
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. You'll be great.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.215
Darn right.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.885
There you go, sir.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.892
l'm sorry. lt's my watch, l'll get it.

15:45.696 --> 15:48.490
l'm so sorry. Let me...

15:55.831 --> 16:01.211
Dave, at Sacred Heart we don't
treat symptoms, we treat people.

16:01.295 --> 16:04.590
- There's something on your back.
- What does this one say?

16:04.673 --> 16:07.634
''Never stop kicking me.''

16:07.718 --> 16:12.097
And on the other side
is my discharge form.

16:12.181 --> 16:16.727
Bob, you tried to discharge me
an hour before l almost died?

16:16.810 --> 16:18.228
Well...

16:20.230 --> 16:22.816
How very clever.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.235
What? lt wasn't me. ln fact...

16:25.319 --> 16:28.906
l think you put it there
yourself to get more attention.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.205
lt was me. l put it there.

16:40.459 --> 16:44.505
Hey, buddy. OK,
forget about everything that's going on.

16:44.588 --> 16:48.467
We know that you're bummed out
about missing Thanksgiving so...

16:48.550 --> 16:51.094
we decided to bring it to you.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.723
Wow, guys, thanks.
Where's the food?

16:59.853 --> 17:02.940
Who wants the unmentionables?

17:05.067 --> 17:07.944
Bambi? Your fever's spiking.

17:08.028 --> 17:12.366
They're worried your appendix might
burst so we're going into surgery now.

17:12.449 --> 17:13.659
Who's on call?

17:13.742 --> 17:16.619
Dr Turk, let's get started.

17:24.127 --> 17:28.006
<i>Most doctors don't believe in
the out-of-body experience thing,</i>

17:28.089 --> 17:30.300
<i>and I don't know
if it was real or a dream,</i>

17:30.384 --> 17:34.012
<i>but I swear I was up there
watching Turk operate on me.</i>

17:34.096 --> 17:37.307
<i>And I have to say,
he's an amazing surgeon.</i>

17:38.600 --> 17:42.104
Dude, could you not look over
my shoulder while l'm doing this?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.022
lt's a little unnerving.

17:44.106 --> 17:48.861
You've got a little fever.
Probably atelectasis from lying in bed.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.822
- l'm really uncomfortable.
- l'm so sorry.

17:51.905 --> 17:55.993
- You're not gonna hug me, are you?
- l'm done with all that.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.788
lf it makes you feel better,
l hate this touchy-feely culture.

17:59.872 --> 18:00.998
Thank you.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.542
That whole ''kiss hello'' thing.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.420
l don't want anyone touching me
unless we have sex.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.714
Even then l don't want them
to overdo it.

18:08.797 --> 18:11.884
- Where in Connecticut are you from?
- Greenwich. You?

18:11.967 --> 18:15.596
Darien.
l'm really burning up here.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.518
God, that's fantastic.
lt's like an ice pack.

18:21.602 --> 18:22.895
Yeah.

18:24.563 --> 18:28.483
l'm sorry to hear about your mom.
Are you at least close with your dad?

18:28.567 --> 18:32.529
You see this right here?
That's his work.

18:32.613 --> 18:35.365
Pretty good for a man
in a wheelchair.

18:35.449 --> 18:38.660
Doc, l'm sorry you gotta be here
on Thanksgiving night.

18:38.744 --> 18:42.623
My wife can't cook anyway, she's 22.
What are you doing?

18:42.706 --> 18:46.335
Forget about me. What's your wife
look like? Any pictures?

18:46.418 --> 18:48.587
Not of this one.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.298
You know, being back at this old place,

18:51.381 --> 18:54.718
you know the thing l have found
to be the most disappointing?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.053
l think l can guess.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.263
You.

18:59.306 --> 19:03.602
Probably because you do things
like show up the Chief of Medicine,

19:03.685 --> 19:07.272
when anybody who's been in a room
with Bob Kelso for two minutes

19:07.356 --> 19:08.857
knows how big an ass he is.

19:08.941 --> 19:13.737
- Go easy, l just thought...
- You don't think, Perry.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.448
You're such a talented doctor.

19:16.532 --> 19:21.703
lf you played the game you'd be in
a position to change things around here.

19:21.787 --> 19:25.624
But you're too stubborn for that,
aren't you?

19:28.335 --> 19:30.087
All right, kid.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.714
Gin. Your deal.

19:46.311 --> 19:49.565
Hi. l just need to
check on your incision.

19:49.648 --> 19:51.859
- Turk, l was an idiot.
- lt's OK, man.

19:51.942 --> 19:56.196
No, seriously, man. l want you to know,
if l ever need surgery again,

19:56.280 --> 19:57.781
l want you inside of me.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.992
l want to be the one inside of you.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.582
Look, JD, l get it.

20:08.208 --> 20:12.421
To me you'll always be that geeky kid
with the Pat Benatar t-shirt.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.047
Dude, she rocks.

20:15.966 --> 20:18.969
l want you to know
how serious l am about what l do.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.346
Did you stitch your initials into me?

20:21.430 --> 20:26.185
That's not important. lt's still
Thanksgiving for 20 more minutes.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.814
Now, you can have ginger ale

20:30.898 --> 20:33.442
and a cracker.

20:34.818 --> 20:38.030
l forgot. Your change. Two pennies.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.949
Get those pennies away from me.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.452
Happy Thanksgiving, man.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.537
<i>I guess what they say is true.</i>

20:45.621 --> 20:48.624
<i>The people you work with
really do become your family.</i>

20:48.707 --> 20:51.001
<i>Like your brother.</i>

20:51.793 --> 20:54.546
<i>And your sister-in-law.</i>

20:54.630 --> 20:57.883
<i>Or that cousin
you have funny feelings for.</i>

20:57.966 --> 21:03.388
<i>And the crazy, angry uncle everyone
sort of hopes isn't coming this year.</i>

21:06.475 --> 21:08.101
Dr Cox.

21:10.479 --> 21:13.315
lf you want, you can
come down here and hang out...

21:13.398 --> 21:15.442
Nobody talk.

21:15.526 --> 21:18.070
Just drink.

21:19.112 --> 21:22.282
<i>Uncomfortable silences
and alcohol.</i>

21:22.366 --> 21:25.118
<i>Just like Thanksgiving at home.</i>

21:26.286 --> 21:28.247
Drink!

21:33.836 --> 21:37.047
- There was the Nina...
- Shut up!
