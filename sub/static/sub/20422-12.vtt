WEBVTT

00:03.080 --> 00:04.840
<i>Uru of the Ninth Garden,</i>

00:05.260 --> 00:07.420
<i>the Abyssal Shaft's final raid boss.</i>

00:08.110 --> 00:09.800
<i>If this had turned into a fight,</i>

00:09.800 --> 00:12.990
<i>even all of Silver Sword working 
together couldn't beat him.</i>

00:14.090 --> 00:15.240
<i>And...</i>

00:17.370 --> 00:19.710
<i>The only difference is the color of his collar patch.</i>

00:20.520 --> 00:22.290
<i>It's impossible to tell them apart.</i>

00:23.370 --> 00:24.900
<i>The Kunie Clan...</i>

00:30.080 --> 00:32.200
<i>Of course... He's frightened.</i>

00:33.130 --> 00:35.880
<i>No matter how many times we 
die, we keep coming back.</i>

00:35.880 --> 00:37.480
<i>It's like some zombie attack.</i>

00:38.450 --> 00:40.220
<i>If something like that attacked me...</i>

00:41.700 --> 00:43.800
<i>Even still, he stands against me.</i>

00:44.220 --> 00:45.320
<i>For pride?</i>

00:45.930 --> 00:49.610
<i>A strong will to protect Yamato 
and the People of the Land?</i>

00:58.600 --> 00:59.950
Yeah!

00:59.950 --> 01:01.580
We did it!

01:08.030 --> 01:09.640
Just one left!

01:09.640 --> 01:10.340
Get readyâ€”

01:16.510 --> 01:18.600
Just one, huh?

01:23.570 --> 01:26.100
I've come to speak to Kinjou.

01:27.190 --> 01:31.740
You have reached this place. 
It is our duty to speak with you.

03:05.790 --> 03:10.090
So that's how the flow of gold coins works?

03:10.750 --> 03:12.120
Correct.

03:12.120 --> 03:16.210
In accordance with the contract, 
we share this information with you.

03:16.670 --> 03:21.470
All gold coins in Yamato are 
born here and return here.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.880
The coins flow by means of ancient technology,

03:24.880 --> 03:28.160
which even we do not understand or control.

03:28.580 --> 03:34.360
The coins are distributed to dungeons 
and monsters from this massive stream.

03:35.150 --> 03:38.670
This structure is a secret hidden 
in the darkness of Yamato.

03:39.580 --> 03:44.620
For centuries, the Kunie have kept it secret.

03:44.990 --> 03:51.000
<b>The Gold of the Kunie</b>

03:48.070 --> 03:49.750
The Gold of the Kunie.

03:53.050 --> 03:55.500
<i>The system that gives gold coins to monsters.</i>

03:56.340 --> 04:00.830
<i>To those of us who knew this as 
a game, it was just a system,</i>

04:00.830 --> 04:03.620
<i>so we can understand that it isn't good or evil.</i>

04:04.270 --> 04:05.010
<i>But...</i>

04:05.460 --> 04:07.860
<i>What would People of the 
Land, who have fought</i>

04:07.860 --> 04:10.510
<i>and been tormented by 
monsters for so long, think?</i>

04:11.380 --> 04:15.410
<i>It's possible they might even consider 
this a betrayal by the Kunie Clan.</i>

04:16.240 --> 04:17.910
<i>Of course the Kunie are concerned.</i>

04:18.750 --> 04:20.550
<i>I hadn't thought that far.</i>

04:22.020 --> 04:25.160
We have no intention of telling anyone the truth

04:25.160 --> 04:26.780
about this zone or even of its existence.

04:27.260 --> 04:32.090
You have reached this place, and according 
to the law passed down for generations,

04:32.090 --> 04:34.290
you have the right to take the gold.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.450
Throughout the centuries, 
part of the law has been lost.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.650
We do not know if you have the right

04:43.650 --> 04:46.060
to take a thousand gold pieces

04:46.650 --> 04:48.400
or a hundred million.

04:48.930 --> 04:52.930
But the legends impart our ancestors' words.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.510
<i>I'm weak...</i>

04:56.730 --> 04:57.560
<i>But even so,</i>

04:58.280 --> 05:00.320
<i>there's someone I want to let win.</i>

05:00.810 --> 05:02.070
<i>I want to repay everyone.</i>

05:02.770 --> 05:03.780
<i>So...</i>

05:03.780 --> 05:06.910
The Kunie's gold brings both fortune and disaster.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.860
A great treasure is no treasure at all.

05:09.860 --> 05:14.690
Beware, for the beast you keep 
will destroy the world.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.770
<i>What I couldn't say to Kinjou...</i>

05:21.300 --> 05:23.300
<i>What I really wanted to say...</i>

05:41.100 --> 05:42.070
What is this?

05:42.440 --> 05:45.740
The contract has been made and completed.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.660
The Round Table does not seek wealth.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.900
We don't even need the rights to the Guild Hall.

05:54.540 --> 06:00.010
We now have the power to live 
peacefully in Akihabara.

06:01.430 --> 06:04.400
We thank the system that gave us this chance,

06:05.010 --> 06:07.050
but that time is over.

06:07.650 --> 06:10.010
Even if another problem occurs,

06:10.580 --> 06:17.060
I've reached the conclusion that it 
should be resolved another way.

06:18.190 --> 06:23.190
This contract spell is completed 
when it is made and torn apart.

06:24.730 --> 06:27.570
We assign all rights for the city of Akihabara

06:27.570 --> 06:31.000
including the Guild Hall, Cathedral, 
and merchant facilities,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.780
to the Yamato server.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.000
And through the destruction of the contract,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.970
we make this assignation of rights eternal.

06:41.350 --> 06:43.630
We purchased Akihabara's

06:43.630 --> 06:45.980
primary facilities to prevent their misuse.

06:46.610 --> 06:49.300
But the cost of their maintenance

06:49.300 --> 06:51.470
was straining the Round Table's budget.

06:52.290 --> 06:54.470
That was why I asked for financing.

06:54.940 --> 06:56.710
After examining a number of possibilities

06:56.710 --> 06:58.480
and debating the matter,

06:58.920 --> 07:01.980
this expedition was my decision.

07:02.180 --> 07:06.580
Then, these coins were the funds 
used to purchase these rights?

07:07.270 --> 07:08.050
Yes.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.160
All gold coins are born here 
and return here, right?

07:12.640 --> 07:14.300
Now that the contract is fulfilled,

07:14.300 --> 07:17.650
it has been exchanged for the 
return of the gold we spent.

07:17.650 --> 07:18.920
All as planned.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.810
You came here to explain this to me?

07:24.160 --> 07:25.750
In a sense.

07:26.270 --> 07:28.630
Then why did you discuss financing?

07:29.640 --> 07:30.990
That's the critical issue.

07:31.720 --> 07:35.520
We wish to purchase every field zone in Yamato.

07:35.520 --> 07:40.020
The forests, mountains, and lakes. Everything.

07:40.340 --> 07:42.240
Every field zone?

07:42.700 --> 07:45.880
And as we just did, we will reassign their rights.

07:46.400 --> 07:51.280
Eventually, we'd like to get rid of 
purchasable zones altogether.

07:51.640 --> 07:56.450
To prevent your enemies from owning them?

07:56.980 --> 07:58.470
Not only that.

07:59.070 --> 08:03.040
Adventurers can purchase zones, 
but the People of the Land can't.

08:04.620 --> 08:09.650
That is unfair, and we believe it may 
become a problem in the future.

08:11.810 --> 08:14.440
I'm not denying the ownership of property.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.330
But I believe contracts between 
people will suffice for that.

08:19.230 --> 08:21.870
So please lend us the money to do this,

08:22.510 --> 08:25.270
so we will not destroy ourselves.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.570
Give us money, so we can return it to this flow!

08:31.390 --> 08:34.820
Yamato's land should be returned to Yamato!

08:37.530 --> 08:40.530
I do owe you all a debt.

08:55.750 --> 08:56.850
<i>We won.</i>

09:03.090 --> 09:04.360
<i>Wow.</i>

09:04.360 --> 09:05.850
<i>This is amazing...</i>

09:09.430 --> 09:12.360
<i>My friends are amazing!</i>

09:13.930 --> 09:15.360
<i>They really are amazing!</i>

09:15.640 --> 09:16.780
We won.

09:16.780 --> 09:18.490
Yeah, we won!

09:18.490 --> 09:20.180
We won.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.110
<b>Eye of Lynceus</b>

09:27.690 --> 09:30.120
<b>Fire-eating Ice Blade</b>

09:28.690 --> 09:30.120
<b>Uroboros Scale</b>

09:30.500 --> 09:33.630
Those are items from the two raid bosses.

09:33.630 --> 09:36.270
Look at all the phantasm-class items...

09:36.820 --> 09:39.610
The rule is that, when we first beat a raid boss,

09:39.610 --> 09:42.640
the guild master chooses who gets the items.

09:45.350 --> 09:47.150
<b>Moon Blossom Talisman

Effect/ Moon Blossom Talisman
Reduces loss of experience points

Strengthens defensive magic as well 
as mental-attribute offensive magic.

Legend/ Moon Blossom Talisman
A phantasm-class talisman carved in 
the image of a flower that, according 
to legend, blooms with the moon's 
cycle. It is said to bless souls in transit.</b>

09:50.830 --> 09:52.570
The Moon Blossom Talisman!

09:52.910 --> 09:56.530
I'd like to give this to the villain in glasses.

10:04.980 --> 10:05.790
What?

10:06.360 --> 10:07.790
The air changed?

10:08.360 --> 10:10.540
It feels warmer, somehow.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.560
I bet he did something.

10:14.370 --> 10:15.410
Listen...

10:15.410 --> 10:16.980
This is a good item!

10:17.690 --> 10:20.740
Its resistances and stat boosts are top notch!

10:21.240 --> 10:23.060
So I am giving it to the villain.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.150
He isn't part of Silver Sword,

10:26.150 --> 10:28.810
but he's a comrade who fought with us!

10:29.980 --> 10:31.150
Prometheus...

10:31.780 --> 10:32.770
Yeah!

10:53.290 --> 10:55.460
<b>Encartanto 
Vuoinen 
Federico 
Demikas</b>

10:58.660 --> 11:01.470
Our names have been carved here for eternity!

11:01.760 --> 11:06.470
We are the first adventurers 
to ever clear this raid zone!

11:14.090 --> 11:15.610
Yeah.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.240
It's okay.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.820
It's over,

11:19.640 --> 11:20.640
Akatsuki.

11:26.470 --> 11:27.720
Marie?

11:28.180 --> 11:29.950
Are you ready?

11:30.460 --> 11:31.510
Marie?

11:35.110 --> 11:36.840
Wh-What's going on?

11:40.570 --> 11:41.540
Marie?

11:41.540 --> 11:43.180
What should I do?!

11:43.180 --> 11:45.890
I can't decide what to wear!

11:46.450 --> 11:48.770
Why not just wear what you always wear?

11:48.770 --> 11:51.120
I haven't seen him for over a month.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.770
I want to welcome him in cute clothes.

11:53.770 --> 11:56.290
Cute clothes, cute clothes, cute clothes!

11:57.090 --> 12:01.990
You know that no matter what 
you wear, he'll be happy.

12:05.210 --> 12:07.370
Well? Don't I look elegant?

12:08.380 --> 12:09.430
Uh...

12:09.430 --> 12:11.870
Why are you dressing up, Rudy?

12:12.260 --> 12:14.530
The new members are also coming, right?

12:14.530 --> 12:17.880
As their superior, I have to look good.

12:18.150 --> 12:20.450
Just go as you always are.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.350
Um, Nyanta, shouldn't we get going?

12:26.070 --> 12:28.390
It's still too early.

12:28.390 --> 12:32.220
Yeah, you're right, but...

12:32.220 --> 12:35.340
They might get there early!

12:35.340 --> 12:36.910
Calm down, Minori.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.370
You know my lord.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.410
He'll arrive right on time.

12:45.380 --> 12:46.790
Akatsuki?

12:46.790 --> 12:48.910
She's a grown-up, so she isn't worried.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.090
<i>After we cleared the raid,</i>

13:03.530 --> 13:05.910
<i>we returned to Susukino.</i>

13:07.190 --> 13:11.060
<i>On the way, I spoke about many things 
with the members of Silver Sword.</i>

13:11.610 --> 13:14.880
<i>What they've experienced since the Apocalypse.</i>

13:14.880 --> 13:16.060
<i>What they've learned.</i>

13:19.500 --> 13:20.880
You damned enchanter,

13:21.530 --> 13:23.030
say my name.

13:28.570 --> 13:32.870
<i>Come to think of it, I never said his name...</i>

13:33.560 --> 13:37.040
<i>No, it feels like I avoided saying it.</i>

13:37.980 --> 13:40.260
<i>It may have simply been self-hatred.</i>

13:40.860 --> 13:44.210
<i>I remembered how powerless I 
felt right after the Apocalypse,</i>

13:44.710 --> 13:49.540
<i>and I took it out on him and his reckless 
behavior, since I could do nothing else.</i>

13:50.300 --> 13:53.550
<i>Stealing someone's name is never all right.</i>

13:54.040 --> 13:57.660
<i>It means you're unwilling to 
recognize them as human.</i>

13:58.130 --> 13:59.060
<i>But...</i>

13:59.860 --> 14:01.180
Demikas,

14:01.180 --> 14:02.940
I don't like you.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.570
Me, neither, Shiroe of Log Horizon.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.750
<i>We were finally able to agree on something.</i>

14:12.100 --> 14:16.040
<i>We agreed on the fact that we'd never agree.</i>

14:16.040 --> 14:18.290
Y-You died?

14:18.770 --> 14:21.060
You both died during the raid?

14:26.690 --> 14:29.050
I w-want to go over there...

14:29.590 --> 14:32.560
He's been badgering us with 
questions since yesterday.

14:33.320 --> 14:37.760
Should I tell you what color panties 
I was wearing when I died?

14:37.760 --> 14:38.730
I don't care.

14:38.730 --> 14:39.810
Ow!

14:38.790 --> 14:39.550
<b>Don't care</b>

14:39.810 --> 14:43.070
Well... What was it like?

14:43.520 --> 14:45.280
How did you come back?

14:45.280 --> 14:47.330
And the moment when you dieâ€”

14:47.330 --> 14:48.320
I won't lose!

14:51.690 --> 14:52.890
You come, too, old guy.

14:52.890 --> 14:54.750
I-I'm not an old guy.

14:54.750 --> 14:58.120
Just let me... Let me talk to them!

14:58.120 --> 15:00.130
Let me talk to them!

15:03.050 --> 15:07.130
I still need to investigate the 
inter-city transport gates.

15:07.130 --> 15:09.900
I'll be heading back to Akihabara soon.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.640
Until then, farewell.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.520
<i>Silver Sword stayed in Susukino, as well.</i>

15:15.060 --> 15:19.460
<i>They'll protect the town as they rebuild 
and prepare for further raids.</i>

15:24.280 --> 15:27.900
Add me to your friend list.

15:31.310 --> 15:32.690
I already have.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.070
Oh.

15:34.070 --> 15:35.270
Okay, then.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.850
And that's how I saved Shiroe.

15:41.850 --> 15:43.840
Right, right. That's great.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.690
What? Hey, it's true!

15:46.690 --> 15:52.420
Shiroe really said, "Thank you, Mr. Demikas,"

15:52.420 --> 15:54.340
with snot dripping from his nose!

15:58.310 --> 15:59.270
What?

15:59.680 --> 16:02.090
You look much happier now.

16:04.580 --> 16:05.940
I'm glad.

16:15.810 --> 16:18.980
I wanted to ride with Naotsugu!

16:18.980 --> 16:22.680
My armor's heavy, so my griffin 
doesn't like to carry two people!

16:23.580 --> 16:26.150
Maybe it's just a special seat for someone?

16:26.740 --> 16:28.710
D-Definitely not!

16:28.710 --> 16:30.750
Don't tease him too much.

16:31.570 --> 16:34.300
It's no fun unless I tease him too much.

16:34.300 --> 16:36.040
When will you tell him

16:36.510 --> 16:37.720
that you're a boy?

16:37.720 --> 16:41.470
Until he figures it out, it's a secret.

16:41.470 --> 16:43.230
It's more fun that way.

16:44.540 --> 16:48.480
Isn't this a delicate time for Naotsugu with Marie?

16:48.480 --> 16:52.680
Hey, Shiro! Why did you let her into the guild?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.240
Because I'm an idol!

16:54.240 --> 16:56.490
Kazuhiko recommended her, too.

16:56.490 --> 16:59.040
Oh, just so we're clear,

16:59.040 --> 17:03.540
I didn't go to Susukino because Kazuhiko said to.

17:04.100 --> 17:05.720
I believe you there.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.280
You can save more people than I can, Shiroe.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.760
Log Horizon isn't a charity, though...

17:13.710 --> 17:20.220
But the world isn't going to 
let you stay uninvolved.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.520
It's a problem, really.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.810
You're quite right.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.560
<b>Kazuhiko

17:38.510 --> 17:39.830
Where's Intix?

17:40.800 --> 17:43.770
Zeldus, don't worry about it.

17:43.660 --> 17:44.820
<b>Mizufa Trudy

17:48.080 --> 17:51.330
Every day is boring without the smell of blood.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.080
I feel like I'm going to rot away.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.340
We have all the time in the world.

17:55.610 --> 17:59.170
I'll wait as long as it takes for battle.

18:00.030 --> 18:01.560
I thought that if we came here,

18:01.560 --> 18:05.520
all that could happen was that we could 
drink good alcohol, Person of the Land.

18:06.350 --> 18:07.150

18:09.560 --> 18:11.530
I'm tired.

18:11.530 --> 18:14.310
I wish you would finish up quickly.

<b>Jered Gun

18:22.360 --> 18:26.160
I was listening for voices calling me 
from beyond the horizon.

18:26.910 --> 18:31.040
No sign of the princess today, either, huh?

18:31.340 --> 18:33.050

18:38.960 --> 18:41.800
So, what of Akihabara's army?

18:41.800 --> 18:45.130
They're continuing their conquest of Seventh Fall.

18:45.130 --> 18:48.560
And that Royal Guard in Akihabara...

18:48.560 --> 18:50.730
It seems he was captured.

18:51.110 --> 18:53.320
One has reported thus.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.820
A Royal Guard in Akihabara?

18:55.210 --> 18:58.200
What's this about? I wasn't told anything.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.150
Do not worry about it.

19:00.150 --> 19:01.950
It's trivial.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.670
The villain in glasses has returned to Akihabara.

19:14.950 --> 19:18.390
Who knows what he was doing in Susukino?

19:17.840 --> 19:21.180
<b>KR

19:19.120 --> 19:21.180
What do we do, Intix?

19:21.590 --> 19:25.150
The interference that doesn't 
work the way you expect is back.

19:32.320 --> 19:36.690
Still, returning all the zones to Yamato, huh?

19:36.690 --> 19:40.930
I didn't think we'd have to go through 
all that to accomplish it...

19:40.930 --> 19:44.110
That's how it's been since the Tea Party, right?

19:44.110 --> 19:45.620
Well, yeah.

19:45.970 --> 19:48.230
KR once told me that

19:48.230 --> 19:51.720
I was born under that sort of star, 
and I should give up trying to change it.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.010
Are those the members of Log Horizon?

19:56.560 --> 19:57.620
Everyone...

19:59.120 --> 20:00.090
Marie!

20:01.270 --> 20:07.100
Hey, everyone! Thanks for 
coming to see me today!

20:07.290 --> 20:09.440
Who's the loud one?

20:09.440 --> 20:10.600
Are you one to talk?

20:10.600 --> 20:12.430
That's Tetra?

20:12.430 --> 20:13.650
She's a girl, huh?

20:14.780 --> 20:19.340
Oh, look... They're holding hands.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.110
I-It's not like that, Marie...

20:22.110 --> 20:24.770
Hey, let me go! Let me go!

20:30.820 --> 20:33.120
Welcome back, Shiroe.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.240
We held down the fort for you.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.710
We went to Choushi.

20:37.710 --> 20:42.400
So we protected both Akihabara and Choushi.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.470
Welcome back, Shiroe.

20:48.630 --> 20:50.280
I'm back, everyone.

20:52.050 --> 20:55.180
Welcome back, Shiroe.

20:55.180 --> 20:59.480
So, should we leave them alone?

20:59.480 --> 21:01.990
Wh-Who is this girl?

21:02.220 --> 21:03.860
Um...

21:04.280 --> 21:06.490
The brightest star shining in the night sky,

21:06.490 --> 21:10.410
the beautiful galactic idol, Tetra!

21:10.970 --> 21:12.500
Call me "Tetra"!

21:12.780 --> 21:14.250
Idol?

21:14.660 --> 21:17.000
I'm a guild master!

21:18.470 --> 21:20.520
They seem busy.

21:21.740 --> 21:24.430
I'll introduce you later.

21:24.430 --> 21:25.220
Huh?

21:25.220 --> 21:26.510
What is it?

21:26.510 --> 21:28.090
Ah, nothing...

21:30.750 --> 21:33.270
Right on time, as I expected.

21:35.290 --> 21:37.330
Did you get taller?

21:37.330 --> 21:38.800
You're terrible, my lord!

21:38.800 --> 21:40.470
Oh, sorry...

21:40.790 --> 21:43.390
But somehow,

21:44.600 --> 21:47.410
you do seem a little more grown up.

21:55.910 --> 21:58.360
Don't be rude, my lord.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.400
I'm sorry.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.080
<i>That's right.</i>

22:02.080 --> 22:03.670
<i>Akatsuki was fighting, too.</i>

22:04.600 --> 22:06.000
<i>Not only Akatsuki.</i>

22:06.420 --> 22:07.530
<i>All of them.</i>

22:08.270 --> 22:09.890
<i>Even if I'm not with them...</i>

22:11.080 --> 22:12.720
<i>Even if we're far apart...</i>

22:14.740 --> 22:16.280
<i>Even if I can't see them...</i>

22:17.830 --> 22:19.790
<i>Everyone is doing their best.</i>

22:20.800 --> 22:22.510
<i>All my companions are</i>

22:23.850 --> 22:25.240
<i>charging forward with me.</i>

22:27.270 --> 22:29.240
I'm back, Akatsuki.

22:30.520 --> 22:33.270
Welcome home, my lord.

24:06.090 --> 24:09.340
Valentine's Day comes to 
the world of <i>Elder Tale</i>.

24:09.800 --> 24:13.090
Even to those with no connection to it, 
and those who don't want it to come.

24:13.610 --> 24:15.850
Those who become happy. 
Those who can't become happy.

24:16.260 --> 24:18.750
I want to know... I want to 
hear what's in your heart.

24:19.180 --> 24:21.220
Whom do you love?

24:21.980 --> 24:24.930
Next time: 2.14 A Sweet Trap.

24:21.980 --> 24:29.940
<b>2.14  A Sweet Trap</b>

24:25.470 --> 24:27.720
I want to rise up once more.
