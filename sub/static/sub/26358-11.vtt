01:36.792 --> 01:38.881
There you are,
my little mountain goat.

01:38.924 --> 01:39.969
Hey.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.276
Third climb this week.Yeah.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.712
Aren't you supposed
to be going up?

01:43.755 --> 01:48.543
Oh, uh, no. This right here,
it's called bouldering.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.936
Yeah. It's good
for strength and balance,

01:50.980 --> 01:52.460
but the real thing
about this sport

01:52.503 --> 01:54.505
is strategy.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.464
It's like playing chess
with your whole body.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.726
Hmm.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.771
Like Mountain Twister,

01:59.815 --> 02:04.472
only, no one's ever plummeted to
their death playing Twister.

02:04.515 --> 02:05.777
Or chess.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.519
Actually, my Uncle Gord...

02:08.563 --> 02:11.566
...he didn't die,
but he did wind up in a coma

02:11.609 --> 02:14.438
from a very aggressive game
of KerPlunk.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.399
Sorry, uh, Sidney just texted me

02:18.442 --> 02:21.010
a photo of a French bulldog
wearing a Santa hat.

02:21.053 --> 02:24.622
Santa hat? Hey, put that away.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.494
Do not want you-know-who
to see it.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.757
He's Rogers, he's not Voldemort.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.975
He banned

02:30.019 --> 02:31.325
the holiday party
from the office.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.369
He may as well be.

02:32.413 --> 02:33.675
I tried to talk to him

02:33.718 --> 02:35.633
about decorating
the bullpen last week,

02:35.677 --> 02:38.332
he got a mysterious phone call
and had to leave the room.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.551
Ooh. Lord of the fake
phone call.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.771
Speaking of
holidays...Yeah?

02:42.814 --> 02:44.207
What's up
with you, Beale?

02:44.251 --> 02:47.645
Hmm? Why are you avoiding
our usual Christmas fun?

02:47.689 --> 02:51.345
You've rescheduled cookie making
for rock climbing twice.

02:51.388 --> 02:54.348
The rock climbing wall will be
here after the holidays.

02:54.391 --> 02:57.960
What do you say we start in
with our annual

02:58.003 --> 02:59.788
Christmas-adjacent
movie night, huh?

02:59.831 --> 03:03.574
Oh, how's tomorrow
for your rock climbing schedule?

03:03.618 --> 03:05.446
I believe it is all clear.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.534
Mm. Good.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.884
Now let me see that Santa pup.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.103
All over it.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.105
ERIC:
Oh, the squishy face

03:13.149 --> 03:15.891
on this little boy.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.676
Hey, Kensi? Where is the tinsel?

03:18.720 --> 03:20.635
Mama said the tinsel
was in here.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.027
Yeah, your mom did
a little pregaming

03:22.071 --> 03:23.638
before her flight to
Miami, so, you know what?

03:23.681 --> 03:25.030
Honestly?
She said a lot of stuff.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.858
Well, then we should
probably add tinsel to the list,

03:26.902 --> 03:28.643
along with, you know, food.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.123
Oh, my gosh, you are
stressing out so much.Well, that's because

03:31.167 --> 03:33.125
our whole entire office is gonna
be here in a few hours.

03:33.169 --> 03:34.301
Well, we didn't have a choice.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.041
You read Rogers's memo
last night.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.434
He was citing some sort of
obscure regulation

03:37.478 --> 03:39.001
about no drinking
next to explosives.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.698
Well, that's an easy fix.
We all become teetotalers,

03:40.742 --> 03:42.526
and don't have booze
at the holiday party.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.441
That sounds so much fun.

03:44.485 --> 03:45.747
Or we could do what the FBI did

03:45.790 --> 03:47.270
and rent out the back room
at Sizzler.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.142
You have a bar.
Why won't you share it?

03:50.186 --> 03:52.971
Because it's brand-new, and I've
got a golden frickin' shark.

03:53.015 --> 03:55.060
Right? They're gonna come here
and just mess it all up

03:55.104 --> 03:56.323
and break all my stemware.

03:56.366 --> 03:57.889
They're not gonna break
all your stemware.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.674
The office needs a party.
You know Nora from accounting.

03:59.717 --> 04:02.154
She always needs, you know,
to get her drank on.

04:02.198 --> 04:04.156
God, she's such
a liability city.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.334
Maybe Rogers was right
about shutting this thing down.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.074
This is very simple. We're gonna
start with the garlands.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.424
Great.And then we're gonna
do the tinsel.

04:10.467 --> 04:11.686
Sounds good.Who are you calling?

04:11.729 --> 04:13.209
Nobody.Deeks, who are you calling?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.515
Hello?Are you calling Sizzler?

04:14.558 --> 04:16.778
Can you take 50 people
at, like, 7:00?
Hey!

04:16.821 --> 04:18.258
I got to go.

04:19.259 --> 04:24.264
All you need is this:
Deeks the halls.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.569
I'm sorry, what?You got to...

04:25.613 --> 04:27.310
Deeks the halls.Are you having a stroke?

04:27.354 --> 04:29.094
You're freaking me out.♪ Deeks the halls with...

04:29.138 --> 04:30.574
Okay, listen. Stop doing that.Okay.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.184
I need you to unravel this.Okay.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.534
And I'm gonna go.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.666
And I want you to think
about what you just did.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.364
It made you laugh.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.018
Good morning, guys.

04:40.062 --> 04:42.064
Morning, DeChamps.You're here early.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.674
Did you chopper up
from San Diego?

04:43.718 --> 04:47.025
Just a sedan from Oceanside
and a 5:00 a.m. wakeup. Nell?

04:47.069 --> 04:49.767
Yeah, so, security cameras
caught this

04:49.811 --> 04:53.249
at a Christmas tree lot in El
Segundo at 2:00 a.m. last night.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.120
LAPD was all over it.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.513
CALLEN:
'Tis the open season.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.733
SAM: It's ridiculous.
These your guys?

04:58.776 --> 05:01.649
DeCHAMPS: The driver's my guy,
active duty at Pendleton.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.173
SAM: The passenger's in a lot of
trouble for firing his weapon.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.914
Odds are,
he still has it with him.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.177
So you came up here this early
from San Diego

05:08.220 --> 05:09.787
because of a couple
drunk Marines?

05:09.831 --> 05:12.790
I know it's not your normal
case, or mine. Hear me out.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.227
The guy who ran is Ernie Garza.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.752
He's in the reserves now, but
he did two tours in Afghanistan

05:17.795 --> 05:19.362
as a sniper in his unit.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.277
Since Garza transferred
to the reserves, he's bounced

05:21.321 --> 05:22.887
from job to job.
He's currently

05:22.931 --> 05:25.281
at a waste management
site in Vernon.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.456
I got permission to pull
his medical records.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.676
He did a stint in
rehab a year ago.

05:28.719 --> 05:31.113
He's currently being treated
for posttraumatic stress.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.724
So we have
a highly trained reservist

05:33.768 --> 05:35.944
with a history of
substance abuse

05:35.987 --> 05:38.947
and PTSD.
And he's armed.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.863
We need to find him before he
hurts someone else, or himself.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.865
Exactly. The holidays
are a tough time

05:43.908 --> 05:45.083
for all service members,

05:45.127 --> 05:47.608
let alone ones with
issues like this.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.087
Well, let's start
with his family.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.306
He have any nearby?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.134
Uh, his girlfriend, Maia.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.310
Most of his relatives
are in San Antonio.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.311
CALLEN:
What about the driver?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.443
ERIC:
Uh, that's, uh,

05:56.486 --> 05:58.749
Marine Staff Sergeant
Brad Hawkins,

05:58.793 --> 06:00.316
uh, stationed
out of Camp Pendleton.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.146
He's got a fairly clean record
until this. Uh...

06:04.189 --> 06:06.844
LAPD has turned him
over to us at the boatshed.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.411
He's been treated
for his injuries

06:08.455 --> 06:10.413
and given a blood
alcohol test.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.980
Results will be in soon.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.852
And I sent Kensi and Deeks over
to Garza's girlfriend's place.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.941
Good call. All right,
why don't the three of us

06:16.985 --> 06:18.595
head over to the boatshed
and talk to Hawkins?

06:18.639 --> 06:21.206
Callen.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.296
Rogers.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.429
Can you come
to my office, please?

06:26.473 --> 06:28.953
On my way.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.222
You wanted to see me?

06:37.266 --> 06:40.617
Do you know a former ATF agent,
Anastasia Kolcheck?

06:40.661 --> 06:43.446
Now serving time for shooting
an unarmed suspect.

06:43.490 --> 06:47.885
Agent Kolcheck, uh, has worked
with this office on occasion.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.887
So I'm learning.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.976
We just received a call
that she sustained an injury

06:52.020 --> 06:53.282
at Alton Prison.

06:53.325 --> 06:56.764
Alton's a state prison.
Why would she be there?

06:56.807 --> 06:58.766
I'm still trying
to wrap my head around

06:58.809 --> 07:01.682
the marijuana dispensaries
on every corner and that spot

07:01.725 --> 07:04.119
in Beverly Hills where Wilshire
and Santa Monica cross.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.425
Why would they do that?

07:05.468 --> 07:07.427
Where is she now?

07:07.470 --> 07:10.734
She was taken to a hospital.
Saint Anne's.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.736
Okay.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.347
I didn't know what you
and your team's relationship was

07:15.391 --> 07:16.784
with her
at this point.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.438
I figured I'd pass it on.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.440
For what it's worth.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.442
Thank you.

07:28.448 --> 07:32.800
Hawkins. NCIS Special
Agent Sam Hanna.

07:32.843 --> 07:36.847
Special Agent
Nicole DeChamps.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.633
Sit down.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.331
Made it all the way
to staff sergeant

07:42.374 --> 07:43.506
without talking
to you guys.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.900
Sorry to break your streak.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.902
We just want to know
what happened last night

07:47.945 --> 07:49.294
so we can find Garza.

07:49.338 --> 07:52.254
So do I.

07:52.297 --> 07:55.083
Garza and I went to Tony's
for a couple of beers.Mm-hmm.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.911
Next thing I know,
Garza's firing his Beretta

07:56.954 --> 07:58.478
and I'm driving my Jeep
through a shed.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.480
Did you know
he had a weapon on him?

08:00.523 --> 08:01.524
No, ma'am.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.395
What time
did you get to the bar?

08:03.439 --> 08:04.745
Maybe 9:00.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.529
Do you guys drink
together often?

08:06.573 --> 08:10.707
Only when we play Madden.
Nothing crazy.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.927
Besides, I wanted
to have a real talk.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.450
And Garza doesn't
listen to anything

08:14.494 --> 08:16.408
when he's running
his West Coast offense.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.498
A real talk about what?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.502
Uh, he'd been acting
kind of strange,

08:22.545 --> 08:24.373
like maybe something was wrong.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.376
I just wanted to make sure
he was all right.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.206
Strange, like he may have been
abusing drugs again?

08:32.816 --> 08:34.339
You know about that.

08:34.383 --> 08:37.429
I was afraid
he'd lose his job,

08:37.473 --> 08:40.955
and get kicked out
of the reserves.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.566
SAM: Something's
not adding up.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.350
You guys weren't doing drugs?

08:45.394 --> 08:48.919
No. No, sir. Not my thing.

08:48.963 --> 08:50.486
Could Garza have
slipped you something?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.923
No. He wouldn't do that.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.969
Hmm.

08:57.798 --> 09:01.236
So your blood alcohol results
came in.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.716
0.03.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.154
You had alcohol in your system,

09:06.197 --> 09:08.460
but it wasn't enough
to make you black out.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.680
Something made you lose
your memory last night.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.465
I got my bell rung pretty good
when we crashed.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.903
Mm. Not enough for a concussion.

09:15.946 --> 09:19.384
Maybe Garza's not the person
you thought he was.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.488
I was told Anastasia Kolcheck
was here.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.795
Let me check.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.841
Are you immediate family?

09:40.884 --> 09:42.756
He is not. But I am.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.627
I'm Anastasia's father.

09:44.671 --> 09:48.631
Looks like your daughter's still
in emergency orthopedic surgery

09:48.675 --> 09:50.067
for another hour.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.416
What happened?What kind of surgery?

09:51.460 --> 09:53.244
Anastasia suffered
two broken ribs

09:53.288 --> 09:56.117
and a serious forearm fracture.
I'm sorry.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.684
There's a waiting room
down that way.

09:57.727 --> 10:00.512
We'll come get you when
she's out of post-op.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.564
Thank you.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.872
Maia?

10:11.915 --> 10:13.874
Hi. You're not carolers.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.658
Uh, no, actually, we are NCIS.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.660
I'm Kensi Blye,
this is my partner Deeks.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.227
It's about Ernie Garza.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.665
What happened?

10:24.014 --> 10:25.755
Sorry, this place is a mess.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.976
I was just finishing up
in here.You're fine.

10:29.019 --> 10:34.024
So, Ernie ran from the cops

10:34.068 --> 10:36.766
after destroying
a Christmas tree lot?

10:39.334 --> 10:41.423
That could be why he didn't
text me back last night.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.294
When was the last
time you saw him?

10:43.338 --> 10:44.600
A few days ago.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.254
We went to a holiday craft fair.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.386
Our friend Jen was selling
some jewelry there.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.171
Then we had a big fight.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.086
But you reached out?

10:52.129 --> 10:57.439
Yeah. I wanted to meet up,
talk things through.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.441
The morning of the fight,
I'd found some hydrocodone

10:59.484 --> 11:01.399
in his car.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.401
I asked him about it.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.273
You were worried
because of his rehab.

11:05.316 --> 11:09.538
Exactly. Ernie was doing
so great with his recovery,

11:09.581 --> 11:12.802
and then he hurt
his shoulder kayaking.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.891
When I saw the pills,
I was afraid he'd relapsed.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.458
What happened when you
confronted him?

11:16.501 --> 11:19.200
He got mad and started
making excuses.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.810
You were just trying to help.

11:20.854 --> 11:23.160
Just trying to follow his lead.

11:23.204 --> 11:26.294
I mean, he helped anyone
who needed it.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.426
Couple weeks ago, he pitched in
and helped make scones

11:28.470 --> 11:29.689
for my baking blog.

11:31.647 --> 11:34.606
I just want him to be okay.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.739
So do we.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.567
And we will keep you posted,
I promise.

11:38.610 --> 11:41.222
Yeah. Actually, if you
think of anything,

11:41.265 --> 11:42.353
please contact us.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.442
I will. Thanks.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.662
KENSI:
Yeah. Thank you.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.752
Hey, um,

11:49.796 --> 11:52.755
I don't need all this
gingerbread for my photo shoot.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.801
Do you guys want
to take some with you?

11:54.844 --> 11:56.890
I mean, do you--
do you think you have enough

11:56.933 --> 11:58.021
for an office party?

11:58.065 --> 11:59.631
KENSI:
Really?

11:59.675 --> 12:02.547
What? She offered,
and I saw an opportunity.Sweetie...

12:02.591 --> 12:04.201
Actually, you know what,
maybe we should go all out

12:04.245 --> 12:05.376
and just make the whole party
a potluck.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.551
Oh, my gosh,
you know what?

12:06.595 --> 12:07.944
I hope you like
green bean casserole,

12:07.988 --> 12:09.293
'cause somebody always
brings green bean casserole.

12:09.337 --> 12:10.425
I don't like it,
but you know what I do?

12:10.468 --> 12:11.905
What?
I love it.

12:11.948 --> 12:14.429
So, it looks like Garza's phone
was last on a few miles

12:14.472 --> 12:15.778
from the Christmas tree lot.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.301
What are you getting
on his finances?

12:17.345 --> 12:19.390
Ugh, nothing
out of the ordinary.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.479
Looks like he hangs out
near the water on the weekends.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.003
I'm gonna try to go
further back.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.439
Sounds good.

12:24.482 --> 12:27.268
Hey, what about Die Hard
for our movie night?

12:27.311 --> 12:30.793
Ooh, a modern
holiday-adjacent classic.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.752
Oh, Three Days
of the Condor.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.450
That is the perfect
Christmasy spy movie.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.800
That is a movie that I always
say that I have seen.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.454
That is a movie
that I have never seen.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.543
ROGERS:
Unbelievable.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.545
Just being honest.

12:43.588 --> 12:47.505
I find it interesting,
smart as you both are,

12:47.549 --> 12:49.116
that you forgot that
it requires a warrant

12:49.159 --> 12:52.206
to track Garza's phone
and check into his finances.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.424
Well, of course.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.165
I mean, we're definitely
not doing that.

12:55.209 --> 12:56.471
That's nothing that
we have ever done.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.472
Whatever you have started,

12:57.515 --> 12:59.082
shut it down.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.824
I've decided not to move forward
into those lines of inquiry.

13:01.868 --> 13:05.262
Really? Even if we find him
by way of his phone?

13:05.306 --> 13:07.177
This office goes way too far
looking into the lives

13:07.221 --> 13:08.570
of private citizens.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.790
Phone records, bank statements.
It's preposterous.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.966
Sir, may I speak candidly?

13:13.009 --> 13:14.402
It's a free country.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.491
In fact, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

13:16.534 --> 13:19.668
Right. But right now, we're not
worried about finding evidence

13:19.711 --> 13:21.191
that can hold up in court.

13:21.235 --> 13:22.584
We just want to
save Garza's life

13:22.627 --> 13:24.542
and prevent anyone else
from being hurt.

13:26.762 --> 13:29.286
Garza's financial records
are off-limits.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.073
I have to take a call.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.382
He said nothing about
pinging Garza's phone.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.863
Hurry, before
the grinch returns.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.082
Mm-hmm.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.093
Can't believe this is
someone's idea of holiday fun.

13:53.136 --> 13:56.270
Speaking of holidays,
what are your plans?

13:56.313 --> 13:57.488
Spending time with your kids?

13:57.532 --> 13:59.490
No, I told my oldest
to go to Brooklyn

13:59.534 --> 14:02.406
and spend time with his
girlfriend and her family.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.234
I think she's good for him.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.410
Sticking around L.A.?

14:06.454 --> 14:08.891
No. Taking my daughter to D.C.,

14:08.935 --> 14:11.198
check out the Navy museum.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.330
Can't wait for her
to see the sights.Well, it's years

14:13.374 --> 14:14.636
since I worked there,
but I could give you guys

14:14.679 --> 14:16.594
recommendations if you like.Mm.

14:16.638 --> 14:17.900
You're daughter's name
is Kammie, right?

14:17.944 --> 14:19.554
It's Kamran.

14:19.597 --> 14:20.860
I almost had it.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.558
We call her Kammie sometimes.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.560
What are you up to?

14:25.603 --> 14:27.649
I'm flying to Baton Rouge
to visit family tonight.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.869
Oh, a little étouffée
and andouille.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.349
You know it, and maybe a
Tigers bowl game on the side.

14:32.393 --> 14:35.309
Mm. On the side, huh?
Sounds good.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.748
Mm. What's up, Nell?

14:39.791 --> 14:42.533
Hey, we pinged Garza's phone
to a marina in San Pedro.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.535
It looks like
he stayed there a while.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.711
On our way.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.547
Kensi said Garza did
a lot of kayaking.

14:56.591 --> 14:59.333
Could have taken off down
the marina for all we know.

15:02.510 --> 15:06.557
Guys, check the registration
on a boat named Diddy Bop.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.473
That's Marine Corps slang
for sloppy marching.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.953
ERIC: Okay.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.824
Father Christmas.
All right, the Diddy Bop

15:12.868 --> 15:14.565
is registered to Reggie Hyland.

15:14.609 --> 15:17.612
He's a Marine that Garza served
with, currently deployed.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.483
All right, thanks.

15:29.537 --> 15:30.538
SAM:
I got him.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.719
Happy holidays.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.212
Sit down.

15:55.302 --> 15:58.305
So what made you decide to go
Rambo on the Christmas lights?

15:58.348 --> 16:00.698
If I knew, I would have
told you by now.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.700
So you don't remember anything
between leaving the bar

16:02.744 --> 16:04.528
and when the Jeep crashed
into the tree lot?

16:04.572 --> 16:06.226
No.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.750
And I won't the next time
you ask me, either.Hey.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.926
Don't do that, man.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.624
Garza, you're safe here.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.542
I've blacked out before,

16:18.586 --> 16:20.762
but never like that.

16:20.805 --> 16:23.852
Did you take anything
when you went out last night?

16:23.895 --> 16:25.462
No.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.554
We know about your relapse
on hydrocodone.

16:33.209 --> 16:37.039
My rotator cuff--
it was killing me.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.389
The pills were an easy fix.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.479
But I stopped and got myself
together, I promise.

16:42.523 --> 16:45.917
And you're sure you didn't
take any pills last night?

16:45.961 --> 16:47.919
And you didn't
give any to Hawkins?

16:47.963 --> 16:51.445
I'm sure, sir.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.404
Garza needs a ghost
of Christmas Past.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.406
More like a DeLorean.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.322
Hey, guys. So, Brad Hawkins'
blood tox results just came in.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.498
It looks like he had
a high concentration

17:01.542 --> 17:03.805
of a drug called scopolamine
in his system.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.415
That's an anti-nausea med

17:05.459 --> 17:07.069
used by scuba divers
and fighter pilots.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.505
Well, in the high quantity,
it probably means that

17:08.549 --> 17:09.811
somebody drugged him.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.421
That's what it's looking like.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.554
We'll let you know as soon as
we get Garza's blood tox back.

17:13.597 --> 17:14.729
Thank you.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.861
Whoever drugged him
is a real Krampus.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.647
Anyone who drugs someone is
a joy-stealing Christmas demon.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.518
Except that they were
out for more than joy.

17:21.562 --> 17:24.043
In South America
they use it to rob people.

17:24.086 --> 17:27.307
Victims empty bank accounts
and hand over jewelry willingly.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.526
How to you explain them
going crazy in the Jeep?

17:29.570 --> 17:31.572
Well, you can still drive
and move on scopolamine,

17:31.615 --> 17:34.531
But it can make your
behavior more erratic.

17:34.575 --> 17:37.099
Plus the memory loss.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.492
You know what--

17:38.535 --> 17:41.451
Hawkins also exhibited
the same physical symptoms

17:41.495 --> 17:43.279
and memory loss as Garza.

17:43.323 --> 17:46.108
Which means whoever drugged
Hawkins also got Garza.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.849
Probably at the bar.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.938
ARKADY:
Anna Kolcheck's room.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.593
What are you doing?

17:52.636 --> 17:54.464
We've been waiting for hours.

17:58.425 --> 18:01.297
Can I help you?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.125
I am her father.
Is she okay?

18:03.169 --> 18:06.259
She fractured her forearm
and ruptured some tendons,

18:06.302 --> 18:09.392
most likely from a direct blow
with a hard object.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.220
It's called
a Monteggia fracture.

18:11.264 --> 18:14.528
During surgery, we set it
together using pins and wires.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.486
Is she in a lot of pain?

18:16.530 --> 18:18.445
At the moment, no.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.534
She came through
the surgery beautifully,

18:20.577 --> 18:22.449
but healing is going
to take some time.

18:22.492 --> 18:23.928
You did surgery?

18:23.972 --> 18:27.628
Yes. Uh, I had some help,
but I was the lead.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.413
I smell vodka.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.415
All right,
ig-ignore him.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.808
When can we go in
and sit with her?

18:33.851 --> 18:36.158
Let the nurse
get her settled first.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.768
You'll be able
to go in there soon.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.380
MAN :
Dr. Evans. Paging Dr. Evans.Excuse me.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.645
What the hell's your problem?

18:44.688 --> 18:46.429
I did not trust her.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.388
Maybe she sees patient
handcuffed to bed,

18:48.431 --> 18:49.737
she phones it in a little bit.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.565
You've never heard
of the Hippocratic oath?

18:53.219 --> 18:55.438
I took oath
to protect Mother Russia,

18:55.482 --> 18:56.874
and here we are.

19:02.663 --> 19:05.492
You really believe
she's going to be okay?

19:05.535 --> 19:06.710
Of course I do.

19:08.277 --> 19:11.585
Otherwise, how'd you be able
to sleep tonight?

19:14.675 --> 19:16.111
Really?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.721
What?

19:17.765 --> 19:20.550
You still think it's my fault
that she's in prison, huh?

19:20.594 --> 19:23.597
All I did
was tell the ATF the truth.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.512
That is what she asked me to do.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.296
It is your fault.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.515
Why?

19:28.558 --> 19:30.691
Is that a real question?

19:30.734 --> 19:33.650
That was a real question.
Why would I want her hurt?

19:35.565 --> 19:37.001
Because hurt people

19:37.045 --> 19:39.221
hurt people.

19:39.265 --> 19:42.529
Did you ever hear of that?
I saw it in a book.

19:42.572 --> 19:43.965
This isn't a joke.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.662
Why would I intentionally
want her hurt?

19:45.706 --> 19:47.098
Who knows
why you do what you do?

19:47.142 --> 19:50.624
I care for her, deeply.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.887
You said you tell truth
on stand.

19:54.584 --> 19:57.718
I do not believe
you tell truth now.

20:12.428 --> 20:15.083
Next time people tell you
L.A. is full of fancy cars

20:15.126 --> 20:17.564
and ridiculous people,
remember this place.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.566
Don't think I'll
forget it anytime soon.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.351
Oh, sorry about the wait.

20:22.395 --> 20:23.874
My beer delivery guy
is a chatty one.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.049
What can I get for you?

20:25.093 --> 20:26.355
NCIS.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.922
Oh, is this about Jim?

20:27.965 --> 20:29.619
I told him not to sell his power
tools in the parking lot.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.752
Okay.Do you know these guys?

20:31.795 --> 20:34.624
Yeah. He's a regular.
What'd he do?

20:34.668 --> 20:36.017
Were you working last night?

20:36.060 --> 20:37.627
Nope, but we can see
what the cameras picked up.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.455
We got a new system.
It's back there.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.631
Jim's not gonna like that.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.851
No, he's not.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.768
There's your guys,
right there.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.204
Who's this?

20:49.248 --> 20:50.727
No, don't recognize him.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.821
Rewind it
to before he approaches.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.871
This wasn't
a random encounter.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.395
Garza and Hawkins
were being watched.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.369
Hey. I saw Rogers
downstairs at the copier.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.936
He says he's coming up here to
talk about something personal.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.897
Ooh.
You did call him a grinch.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.507
He probably heard.

21:31.551 --> 21:33.770
You know what,
I bet you're right.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.032
You haven't seen me.

21:35.076 --> 21:37.470
Oh, but Eric.
The Grinch's heart

21:37.513 --> 21:39.080
grows by three times its size
at the end of the film.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.387
Plus he returns
half the presents he stole.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.606
Nell, no one has ever told
anyone they're a grinch

21:43.650 --> 21:46.348
and meant it in a
positive way.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.524
NELL:
Oh, hello, sir.

21:48.568 --> 21:49.786
I'm glad you're here.

21:49.830 --> 21:50.874
Where's Eric?

21:50.918 --> 21:53.790
Oh, you know.
He's... he's around.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.445
I want to speak with you
about a holiday-related matter.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.055
Okay, shoot.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.796
I have some people
coming to town this evening.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.146
I'd like you to recommend
a seasonal activity.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.670
Preferably one
that does not involve

22:03.713 --> 22:05.976
watching movies
or talking about movies.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.805
Hey, uh, sorry to, uh...
Just happened to overhear.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.590
I was fixing this...

22:10.633 --> 22:12.026
uh, monitor, here.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.767
Hey, we love this question.

22:13.810 --> 22:17.336
We do. It is a rather
big question,

22:17.379 --> 22:18.685
and really depends
on your guests.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.121
What are their
seasonal preferences--

22:20.164 --> 22:22.384
Christmas, Hanukkah,
Boxing Day?

22:22.428 --> 22:23.690
What do you like to do?

22:23.733 --> 22:25.431
Ooh, lights or caroling?

22:25.474 --> 22:28.695
Maybe markets? Markets.Markets...
The Farmer's market on Fairfax.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.000
They do the whole thing
with the...

22:30.044 --> 22:31.175
with all the decorations.

22:31.219 --> 22:33.439
Rose Bowl Flea Market--
big crowd-pleaser,

22:33.482 --> 22:35.484
lots of unique gift ideas.It's a good one.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.268
You could also try downtown...Okay.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.096
Farmer's market...

22:39.140 --> 22:41.838
and the flea market.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.449
Thank you, Nell, Eric.

22:43.492 --> 22:46.277
I'll consider that and maybe
consult TripAdvisor. Carry on.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.149
ERIC:
Yeah, but...

22:48.192 --> 22:50.325
I had, like, 14 more ideas
for that guy.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.544
Exactly.

22:52.588 --> 22:53.720
Howdy, boys.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.069
Kensi got something
to show you.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.420
When you guys met
at the bar yesterday,

22:58.464 --> 22:59.769
do you remember
talking to this guy?

22:59.813 --> 23:02.772
Yeah. Yeah,
for a little while.

23:02.816 --> 23:05.253
We talk to people
in there all the time.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.646
They're friendly in there.

23:06.689 --> 23:07.864
Okay, well, you...
do you remember

23:07.908 --> 23:09.562
a conversation with him,
specifically?

23:09.605 --> 23:11.912
Small talk. Sports.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.653
He asked about Garza's job.

23:14.828 --> 23:18.440
Most people aren't that
interested in waste management.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.616
Hmm.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.444
Hold that thought.

23:22.488 --> 23:23.663
We'll be right back.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.756
So this guy sits
with Garza and Hawkins,

23:29.799 --> 23:31.888
buys them a round
and slips scopolamine in it.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.847
Scopolamine
makes you talkative.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.805
To everybody else, you're just
having a conversation.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.546
Well, and once it takes effect
after a few minutes,

23:37.590 --> 23:39.200
this guy could have been
asking Garza to give up

23:39.243 --> 23:41.202
information on the waste
management facility.

23:41.245 --> 23:42.682
We need to figure out
why someone would

23:42.725 --> 23:44.814
go to all that trouble.DEEKS: Should we draw straws?

23:44.858 --> 23:46.816
See who goes
to waste management,

23:46.860 --> 23:49.819
'cause I bet it smells like
pine needles and cinnamon.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.995
We'll go.Oh, we will?

23:53.214 --> 23:54.694
Well, ask Garza
to tell you everything

23:54.737 --> 23:56.347
he could have told this guy
about his job,

23:56.391 --> 23:58.611
including how
to bypass security.

23:58.654 --> 24:01.091
All right. Kens,
we're getting back in there.

24:01.135 --> 24:03.746
You know what's up?
Lighting round. You go first.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.454
There she is.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.851
I thought I told you
to stay away.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.943
Well, you didn't
say anything about hospitals.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.514
Looks like your new neighbors
are bullies.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.733
Yeah.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.910
Don't worry,
I took care of them.

24:36.953 --> 24:41.044
Maybe not as well as
I could have, but...

24:43.873 --> 24:44.961
Want some water?

24:59.280 --> 25:02.544
And I promise not to make
any Bionic Womanjokes

25:02.588 --> 25:05.329
about your arm, considering
two of the nurses already did.

25:05.373 --> 25:08.507
Mm. Appreciate that.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.295
Callen, I...

25:14.338 --> 25:17.820
No. You don't need
to talk about what happened.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.651
Your only job right now
is to get some rest.

25:25.349 --> 25:26.916
I can manage that.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.964
And I'm actually
gonna enjoy the quiet.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.967
Considering I've been
sitting with your father.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.883
Listening to him chat up
some Russian couple.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.755
He does, in fact, have plans
for New Year's Eve now.

25:41.104 --> 25:43.106
Yeah. Sounds about right.

25:50.766 --> 25:53.377
Get some rest.

25:58.469 --> 26:00.471
I'll be right here.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.831
MAN:
Okay,

26:11.874 --> 26:14.007
this right here
is where the magic happens.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.139
It's a tight system, you know?

26:16.183 --> 26:19.012
We process hundreds of
shipments a day. If we didn't

26:19.055 --> 26:20.666
schedule everything
in a tight way,

26:20.709 --> 26:22.885
it'd just be chaos.I believe it.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.452
Ernie Garza
has the same job as you.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.019
You know why
anyone would approach him?

26:26.062 --> 26:27.281
No, I'm...

26:27.324 --> 26:28.804
He's a pretty good dude,
you know?

26:28.848 --> 26:31.633
Talks about Madden
a lot, but...

26:31.677 --> 26:33.766
What's this about?
Did-did something happen?

26:34.984 --> 26:36.638
Do you guys
process any hazardous waste

26:36.682 --> 26:38.031
that could be weaponized?

26:38.074 --> 26:39.946
No, man, n-nothing like that.

26:39.989 --> 26:42.775
I mean, we-we process standard
household stuff, you know?

26:42.818 --> 26:45.168
Used paint, oil, uh,
expired medicines.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.779
Expired medicines?

26:46.822 --> 26:50.565
You mean, like, unused pills
from pharmacies and hospitals?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.088
Yeah, they come in
from all over.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.613
We process about
three loads a week.

26:54.656 --> 26:57.354
You know? We're gonna
burn one later today.

26:59.966 --> 27:00.967
Tell me when.

27:01.010 --> 27:04.100
Uh...

27:04.144 --> 27:06.146
shipment came in at 10:00 a.m.,

27:06.189 --> 27:07.974
we're incinerating it
in half an hour.

27:08.017 --> 27:11.020
Is the far side of the
dock visible with cameras?

27:11.064 --> 27:12.587
Yeah, of course it is.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.328
I mean, I'm-I'm pretty sure.

27:14.371 --> 27:15.808
You guys want
to hang out here,

27:15.851 --> 27:18.114
I can go check.No, no, no.
Show us the dock.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.246
Okay.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.427
Yeah, just right over here.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.133
What the...

27:38.134 --> 27:40.180
Someone got away with
a truck full of meds

27:40.223 --> 27:42.051
that could be sold again
out on the street.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.793
Even a tight system
can have cracks.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.415
There you are.Yeah.

27:58.459 --> 27:59.721
I'm watching out
for Rogers.Hmm.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.767
I don't want him
asking us for any more

28:01.810 --> 28:04.770
"seasonal recommendations"
I can't take it.Ooh, I hear you.

28:04.813 --> 28:06.597
All right, anything
on the facility?

28:06.641 --> 28:09.252
Uh, yeah. A weakness
in the security system.

28:09.296 --> 28:11.515
Someone drove a truck in,
loaded it with drugs

28:11.559 --> 28:12.647
waiting to be
incinerated,

28:12.691 --> 28:14.780
and drove off.Okay.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.216
So where's the footage?

28:16.259 --> 28:17.870
Well, Sam says the waste
management company's

28:17.913 --> 28:19.872
claiming
security malfunction.

28:19.915 --> 28:22.004
They're not handing over any
footage of the loading docks

28:22.048 --> 28:24.877
without a warrant.All right, so we get one.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.182
Yeah.Rogers will like that.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.271
You can tell what he likes?

28:30.143 --> 28:32.885
NELL: Ooh, there's our
guy from the bar.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.802
All right. Maze Cooper.

28:36.845 --> 28:39.718
Years ago he had some
low-level misdemeanors.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.676
His name pops up
on a DEA watch list

28:41.720 --> 28:44.810
for doctors shopping
to get prescription meds.Hmm.

28:44.853 --> 28:48.204
And facial rec puts Maze
in the background

28:48.248 --> 28:50.511
of some party photos
on social media.

28:51.817 --> 28:55.516
You mean Joe Jirani's

28:55.559 --> 28:58.432
social media feed?

28:58.475 --> 29:01.783
Okay, this guy is supposedly
a real estate mogul,

29:01.827 --> 29:03.742
but it looks like he's
got tons of downtime

29:03.785 --> 29:07.658
to post pics of his,
uh, off-road vehicles,

29:07.702 --> 29:09.486
his... wow,

29:09.530 --> 29:11.880
several lady friends, and, uh,

29:11.924 --> 29:14.883
an extremely festive
Persian cat.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.801
Oh. Okay, get this.

29:19.845 --> 29:23.239
So, it looks like
Jirani is also

29:23.283 --> 29:25.285
a known drug dealer
who has somehow

29:25.328 --> 29:26.721
managed to evade the law.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.593
All right, pulling up
real estate records.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.987
Huh.
Jirani owns a massive ranch

29:32.031 --> 29:33.641
in Agua Dulce.

29:33.684 --> 29:36.600
Mm. There's a lot of room
for his off-road vehicles.

29:36.644 --> 29:39.125
Not to mention a truck
full of pharmaceuticals.

29:39.168 --> 29:40.779

30:03.062 --> 30:05.368
then we'll locate
Maze and Jirani.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.717
Copy that, Sam.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.719
Wait for it.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.642
Up, up and away.

30:18.686 --> 30:21.950

We got eyes on the compound.

Wow, okay, well,

some magic elf dust
to his guests.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.883
Maybe I can borrow
their tinsel.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.319
Ooh. Okay, guys,
we've got a truck.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.756
It's a quarter mile
northwest,

30:45.800 --> 30:47.410
over the hill.

of why we shouldn't do drugs.

31:27.015 --> 31:29.670
So, uh, Sam, we have
a visual confirmation

31:29.713 --> 31:31.193

pharmaceuticals.

31:31.237 --> 31:33.021
