00:49.007 --> 00:52.045
Hi. Hi. I know.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.816
Still have an L-1420 male plug?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.322
I saw one here last week.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.699
On your left.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.155
By the timing belt.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.074
Genny out again?

02:45.248 --> 02:49.162
Oh, Early, if anything worked up
at that place, I'd get bored.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.838
Storm's coming.
Did you see the weather?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.043
Yeah, they say ice.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.880
Early for ice.
Leaves are still on the trees.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.591
But that's what they say, a few inches.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.306
You get that VHF radio working?

03:03.475 --> 03:05.637
It's on my to-do list.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.271
Stay warm.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.019
Stay warm, Grace.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.172
<i>Focus now.</i>

03:36.341 --> 03:37.923
<i>Push yourself.</i>

03:38.468 --> 03:41.256
It feels like glass under my skin.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.511
I can't.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.974
That shoulder spent 10 months
in a coma, same as you, without rehab.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.731
It's unstable. Trust me, pain is good.
Pain says your body's still working.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.732
I just want out of the chair.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.235
We'll get you there,
but this will take a while.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.233
Okay.

04:18.716 --> 04:22.301
Surprise delivery.
It was orphaned at the post office.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.054
Mary said it'd been there over a week.
Maybe you forgot.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.930
That's sweet.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.308
You didn't have to drive here
in this weather.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.687
Believe me, I know that. Colder
than an Alaskan outhouse right now.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.067
- Oh, I'm sorry, Colin. Come on in.
- Thanks.

04:40.739 --> 04:44.073
- Are you headed to the station?
- Yep, boss wants someone on-site.

04:44.242 --> 04:47.906
Hey, Kate. They say we're supposed
to get some ice tonight.

04:48.079 --> 04:52.039
I wasn't here for the storm in '03,
but they were without power for nine days.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.496
I'll send you with some coffee.

04:58.089 --> 05:02.709
If you ever wanted to come along
sometime, I'd be happy to give you a tour.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.968
Sounds nice.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.427
Maybe when the weather passes.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.432
Yeah, yeah, sure.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.434
That's what I meant.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.979
When you gonna unpack?

05:16.858 --> 05:20.147
I'm sure I'll get around to it
sooner or later.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.654
- Happy to help if you want.
- I'll let you know.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.241
Be careful out there.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.527
Okay, then.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.822
Bye, Kate.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.977
Hey, you.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.380
I'm not doing very well.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.685
I told myself I wasn't gonna tell you that.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.735
That's the last thing
you need to hear, right?

07:01.922 --> 07:04.380
I'm thinking about going away.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.528
Help...

09:22.687 --> 09:25.680
<i>We're getting the hell out of here.
Temperature's 20 degrees...</i>

09:25.857 --> 09:27.098
<i>The wind chill.</i>

09:27.275 --> 09:29.483
<i>...the park entrances.</i>

09:29.652 --> 09:32.110
<i>Open the fire road.</i>

09:32.989 --> 09:35.823
Broadcasting in the blind. Hello?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.579
Can anyone read me?

09:46.753 --> 09:49.211
Is anyone hearing this? Hello?

09:58.473 --> 10:00.965
Oh, come on. Come on.

10:16.908 --> 10:20.993
And Karakurt popped out of the trunk.
Tom had brought him to my doorstep.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.574
I should've been livid, but he was...

10:23.748 --> 10:26.115
And I'll deny ever admitting this.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.909
He was pretty damn charming
about the whole thing.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.373
You remember that cabin?

10:30.547 --> 10:31.788
Cabin?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.001
Mattias Solomon.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.588
A few thousand rounds of ammo later,
I finally got my hearing back.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.048
Keen was good in the field though.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.303
Well, to Tom.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.385
- To Tom.
- To Tom.

11:03.121 --> 11:06.239
<i>Stay tuned to this channel...</i>

11:06.749 --> 11:09.082
<i>This is Radio KAKN Alaska...</i>

11:09.252 --> 11:11.539
<i>...issuing weather warnings
for the boroughs:</i>

11:12.172 --> 11:14.129
<i>- Bethel, Denali...</i>
- Colin?

11:14.299 --> 11:16.837
<i>...Fairbanks North Star,
Matanuska-Susitna.</i>

11:17.010 --> 11:19.548
<i>Two to four inches of ice accumulation

11:20.180 --> 11:23.673
<i>A total power outage of
Southeast Fairbanks has been reported.</i>

11:23.850 --> 11:25.261
<i>The foll...</i>

11:46.080 --> 11:48.447
I need you to promise me something.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.367
Of course.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.878
The Blacklist...

11:55.548 --> 11:58.461
...promise you'll keep working it
with the task force.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.718
Doesn't work without you.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.128
It has to.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.720
- I think we've done enough.
- What you've done...

12:06.893 --> 12:10.728
What you've made it possible
for the task force to do...

12:12.815 --> 12:15.558
You know,
I've never thanked you for that.

12:16.986 --> 12:21.321
Why you do it, what you get out of it
at the end of the day, it doesn't matter.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.700
But I need you to promise me
you're gonna keep doing it.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.736
I promise.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.033
Thank you.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.744
I have one more favor to ask you.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.500
And it's not gonna be easy for you.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.382
But it's important to me.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.418
Okay.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.426
I don't want you to follow me.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.884
You're gonna let go.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.062
Can you do that?

12:57.652 --> 12:59.564
What about Agnes?

13:51.873 --> 13:54.206
What the hell's going on here?

13:57.795 --> 13:59.002
Hey.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.255
Take it easy, lady.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.504
Who the hell are you people?

14:07.722 --> 14:09.463
Sorry if we scared you. I just...

14:09.640 --> 14:12.508
I don't know if we'd last much longer
out there in that wind.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.395
- You said your plane went down?
- No, not my plane. Charter.

14:16.564 --> 14:20.148
Ellis read about these fishing trips
out of Lake Hood.

14:20.318 --> 14:24.187
I mean, it seemed like a good idea
at the time. Always does, right?

14:24.781 --> 14:27.649
You know, floatplanes,
campfires, big sky.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.533
- We hit weather.
- What we hit was ice.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.162
Yeah, I could see it freezing up
on the wing. Couple inches.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.324
Before we knew it,
it started breaking off.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.335
Sounded like a damn hammer
hitting that plane.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.205
Must've busted something
because last thing I know...

14:43.966 --> 14:47.630
- ...the pilot's saying he lost an engine.
- You went down where?

14:47.804 --> 14:49.295
A mile back, maybe two.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.964
- I didn't hear anything.
- It was further than that.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.428
It must've been six, 10 miles.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.310
I don't know. The weather.
We got turned around.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.019
- You were all able to just walk away.
- Well, we got lucky.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.525
- The pilot...
- Is he the guy in the other room?

15:03.694 --> 15:05.856
No. The pilot didn't...

15:06.030 --> 15:08.147
Didn't make it. We had to leave him.

15:08.324 --> 15:12.113
Mike, the guy in your bedroom,
was cut up pretty bad on the way down.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.528
He was bleeding,
but wouldn't wait for help.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.743
So he started walking,
dumb son of a bitch.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.500
- We couldn't talk sense into him.
- Temperature dropped.

15:20.670 --> 15:24.960
- Thought we were gonna die out there.
- So we just started walking.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.501
We never found Mike, but we saw
the smoke from your chimney.

15:28.678 --> 15:32.171
No lights. No locks.
We thought the place was empty.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.967
He was out when I found him.

15:37.145 --> 15:40.263
- How'd you find him?
- Actually, he found me.

15:41.607 --> 15:42.848
Is he gonna be okay?

15:43.025 --> 15:44.982
Not if we don't get him to a hospital.

15:45.153 --> 15:48.112
I closed up his wounds,
but he's bleeding internally.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.774
You can tell by his breathing.
There's blood in his airways.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.159
He's got a few hours, maybe.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.660
What about the roads?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.992
Good luck out there. It's an ice rink.

15:58.166 --> 16:02.160
Block's frozen on my truck.
Even if I had a phone, the lines are down.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.295
Look, bottom line is we gotta get
your friend out of here fast.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.626
And I have no idea how.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.003
We had these to stay in touch on the trip.

16:12.180 --> 16:15.969
- You know, maybe we could...
- These are short-range.

16:16.142 --> 16:20.557
Good if we wanna talk to each other
but useless if we wanna call for help.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.606
I never asked your name.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.391
Grace.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.103
- It's Grace.
- Grace.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.071
That's nice.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.407
You're bleeding.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.742
So, what's your story anyway?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.202
Up here, all alone.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.244
You know the story.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.956
A girl in a cabin with a gun and a dog.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.796
I don't think I've heard that one.

16:52.970 --> 16:57.180
I'll tell it to you sometime when you don't
have a needle sticking out of your arm.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.888
Trust me, it's not that interesting.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.390
Well, I doubt that.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.555
I don't know many people...

17:04.732 --> 17:06.689
People who...

17:06.858 --> 17:10.819
...could diagnose internal bleeding
by the sound of somebody's breathing.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.901
- You a doctor or something?
- Turn this way.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.445
Come on.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.407
There has to be a halfway decent story.

17:20.580 --> 17:23.493
No, Mr. Mysterious...

17:23.876 --> 17:25.867
...out there...

17:26.045 --> 17:28.458
...on his way home right now?

17:30.341 --> 17:32.458
There was, once.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.926
Didn't work out.

17:36.764 --> 17:40.132
I don't know who killed Tom or why.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.639
But I saw them.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.433
So they might come after me.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.145
If they did
and anything happens to Agnes...

17:49.318 --> 17:51.935
Liz, I told you,
you don't have to explain that to me.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.821
This is the hardest thing I've ever done.

17:56.450 --> 17:59.067
I'm just so angry.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.329
And she knows it.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.866
And I can't make it go away.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.369
Agnes will be fine.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.677
And what about you?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.048
What about the pain
you're feeling? The anger?

18:21.225 --> 18:23.342
Can you protect her from that?

18:26.022 --> 18:29.857
I spent 30 years mourning Tom's loss.

18:30.026 --> 18:33.235
Where you are, I was there the day
he disappeared from that beach...

18:33.404 --> 18:35.236
...when he was a little boy.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.823
Yes.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.235
Sad and angry.

18:41.412 --> 18:47.033
But Tom coming back to me
after all these years was a gift.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.711
He loved you very much.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.757
It couldn't have been easy for him.

18:55.926 --> 18:59.010
Testifying for me against his father.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.721
But he didn't hesitate.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.928
The boy I'd given up for dead
came back to life to save me.

19:07.813 --> 19:12.308
And to give me his beautiful baby girl
who I'm gonna spoil rotten.

19:15.446 --> 19:20.612
She loves Cheerios
and <i>Thomas the Train</i> in the morning.

19:21.869 --> 19:27.285
And she gets so cranky because
she's hot at night, so just a light blanket.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.369
Liz...

19:31.879 --> 19:33.962
...she's gonna be fine.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.123
- She is.
- Okay.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.916
I'm gonna take good care of her.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.379
She'll be healthy and happy.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.507
And when you are, and that will happen...

19:44.684 --> 19:46.346
...you'll take her back.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.980
<i>Grace?</i>

19:56.862 --> 19:59.024
I said, what's the diagnosis?

19:59.615 --> 20:02.323
- I think you might live.
- Ah, good.

20:05.413 --> 20:09.123
- I need to go check the radio.
- There's a...? There's a radio?

20:09.291 --> 20:12.750
An old one in the barn
used for calling in weather reports.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.754
It hasn't worked in years,
but if I could get it running...

20:15.923 --> 20:19.132
- Well, you want a hand? I'll help.
- I'm a big girl.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.842
If anyone can hear me,
acknowledge this transmission. Copy.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.556
Anybody? Hello?

20:37.862 --> 20:39.194
Hey.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.694
What do you think of these guys, huh?

20:45.536 --> 20:47.949
Yeah, I'm not buying it either.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.955
There you are. Came soon as I could.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.119
Cavalry showed up.

20:56.297 --> 20:59.040
- What's going on?
- Like they said, there's been an accident.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.253
They said. Where were you flying out of?

21:01.427 --> 21:04.215
- Lake Hood, a fishing charter.
- We're lucky to be alive.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.506
Our friend Mike, he's not so lucky.
We gotta get him to a doctor.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.552
Roads are impossible. It's getting worse.
Radio's down at the station. I had to walk.

21:11.729 --> 21:14.437
- There's a radio on the plane.
- Tried that. Didn't work.

21:14.607 --> 21:18.601
If we could get it to work, or at least get
the locator working on the black box...

21:18.778 --> 21:21.236
...Search and Rescue could medevac
your friend out.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.443
I can help.
I have a decent sense of direction.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.904
I can get us back
to that wreckage. I know it.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.864
What about you?
You gonna be okay here?

21:29.038 --> 21:30.245
No, I'm not okay.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.907
There's a stranger bleeding to death
in my bed. You could use me out there.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.206
Yeah, but if you go, who looks after Mike?

21:37.963 --> 21:39.499
Because I can't.

21:40.090 --> 21:43.800
Please, don't make me tell his wife
he died on my watch.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.675
Hey, I got a question for you.
These guys, their story...

21:51.852 --> 21:53.684
...anything seem off to you?

21:53.854 --> 21:55.265
What do you mean, "off"?

21:55.439 --> 21:59.479
They walked 10 miles in this weather?
From a crash I never heard.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.688
Don't be silly.

22:01.320 --> 22:05.360
Not a broken bone on one of them.
I think I should go with you.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.109
You're being paranoid.
Come on. Everything will be fine.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.448
We'll be back before you know it.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.829
It's all right.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.706
You're gonna be okay.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.330
We're gonna get you some help.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.542
Your friends are in the other room.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.630
Not friends.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.717
Then who the hell are they?

22:34.770 --> 22:36.181
They'll kill you too.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.989
Ratted Carlucci family.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.281
The Carlucci crime family?

22:56.458 --> 22:58.290
What are you doing up here?

22:58.460 --> 23:01.703
Witness protection.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.836
WitSec dumped you up here.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.297
But your old friends found you
just the same.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.299
Please.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.468
They'll kill me.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.619
How are we gonna get you out of here?

23:35.205 --> 23:37.913
They'll kill you too.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.120
Everything okay in here?

23:43.297 --> 23:45.584
Yeah. He's good.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.130
He'll push through a few more hours.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.922
He's a fighter.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.765
That crash. I never thought our hunting
adventure would turn out like this.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.106
"Hunting"?
I thought you said you were fishing.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.277
What?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.858
Damn it. Sorry.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.445
- Here. Let me help.
- No, no. You stay put.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.484
There's glass everywhere.

24:14.954 --> 24:15.990
Ellis.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.162
Hey.

24:19.041 --> 24:22.079
Get your damn feet off the table.
Show some respect.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.584
Seriously?

24:32.096 --> 24:34.338
- Bears.
- What?

24:34.515 --> 24:36.222
What I wanted to hunt, bears.

24:36.392 --> 24:40.636
I had a grand vision of bagging a grizzly.

24:40.813 --> 24:44.477
Orson and the others wanted to fish.
We were gonna split up the trip.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.358
They didn't get their fish.
I didn't get my bear.

24:47.528 --> 24:52.193
- You know it's illegal to hunt bears.
- What, you never broke a rule or two?

24:55.577 --> 24:57.318
You done with that?

24:57.496 --> 24:58.532
I guess.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.117
Why still wear your ring?

25:05.754 --> 25:06.790
Excuse me?

25:07.756 --> 25:09.918
Wedding ring on your finger.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.385
My husband gave it to me.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.798
I thought you said that didn't work out.
What happened?

25:19.518 --> 25:20.850
I lost him.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.888
That's why you're up here
in the middle of nowhere...

25:24.064 --> 25:26.181
...with a bunch of unpacked boxes.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.395
Just a lady and her dog...

25:28.569 --> 25:30.310
...and a gun.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.441
Where is Kate?

25:33.615 --> 25:35.072
Who?

25:35.617 --> 25:37.529
Kate, my dog.

25:39.496 --> 25:43.331
You were right about that weather.
I was not dressed warm enough.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.536
Where's Colin?

25:45.377 --> 25:48.916
We got a mile down the trail, bumped
into another ranger on a three-wheeler.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.673
Only had room for one. They headed
back to town, said they'd call for help.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.709
Told me to get back here
before I froze.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.503
You seen my dog?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.387
What? No.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.515
Kate.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.433
Kate.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.276
You sure she's not in the barn?

26:19.912 --> 26:23.076
Maybe she got spooked
with the storm and all.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.453
Think I'll brave the weather.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.289
She's probably outside.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.506
- What the hell was that?
- Damn generator.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.424
It happens all the time.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.470
- What do we do?
- You do nothing. I'm gonna go fix it.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.309
It's bad out. You'll need help.

26:49.483 --> 26:53.727
You know the one thing that I have
learned all my time out here alone?

26:54.530 --> 26:55.691
What's that?

26:55.864 --> 26:58.106
Men just get in my way.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.321
I'll be right back.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.779
You've entrusted Agnes
to Scottie Hargrave?

28:19.948 --> 28:23.112
Yes. Tom's mother.

28:23.285 --> 28:25.698
Who ordered a hit on your wedding.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.284
She didn't know who we were.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.121
She's a good person.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.287
And she'll keep Agnes safe.

28:35.464 --> 28:38.332
Look, I know you took care of her
while I was in the hospital.

28:38.508 --> 28:41.125
And I can't thank you enough for that.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.215
But this is my decision.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.338
I need you to respect that.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.015
Okay, I will.

28:48.936 --> 28:51.019
I want you to promise me something.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.602
- What?
- That you'll grieve.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.227
Of course I'll grieve.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.611
What do you think I'm doing?

29:00.781 --> 29:04.741
Running away from your problems
when you should be facing them.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.407
I'm sure it feels like you're staring
into an abyss.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.788
Until you mourn,
you won't be able to cross it.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.746
What's so great about crossing it?
What's on the other side?

29:13.919 --> 29:15.660
Peace? Tranquility?

29:15.837 --> 29:17.044
Some.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.213
I prefer revenge.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.670
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Really?

29:21.843 --> 29:25.757
Because imagining
what I'm gonna do to Tom's killers...

29:25.931 --> 29:29.345
...that's the only thing that gets me
out of bed in the morning.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.969
Don't just go off and hide in the dark.

29:33.146 --> 29:36.856
Wherever you go, look for some light.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.532
Hey, Billy. You there?

29:54.418 --> 29:57.161
Grace, what's going on out there?

29:57.337 --> 29:58.919
<i>Why haven't the lights come back?</i>

29:59.089 --> 30:03.459
Because you killed my dog
and you killed my friend Colin.

30:09.349 --> 30:12.342
Don't make this any harder.
We haven't killed you yet.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.930
And I haven't killed you yet.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.555
<i>I know that man in my room
is not your friend.</i>

30:16.732 --> 30:18.815
<i>Just like there was no plane crash.</i>

30:18.984 --> 30:21.101
Car accident, actually...

30:21.611 --> 30:24.524
...trying to get out of this weather.
Our trunk popped open.

30:24.698 --> 30:27.361
<i>Damn cargo ran off into the woods.</i>

30:27.534 --> 30:29.776
<i>We chased the son of a bitch for hours.</i>

30:29.953 --> 30:32.821
- I'm not leaving here without him.
<i>- Why notjust kill him?</i>

30:32.998 --> 30:36.366
- Why not kill me?
<i>- We needed you to keep him breathing.</i>

30:36.543 --> 30:39.502
Boss wants him alive
so he can tell us what he told the feds.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.162
Only then can he die.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.414
Slowly.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.458
That's my specialty.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.086
And now you can too.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.632
That's a nasty habit you've got there.
I noticed.

30:52.809 --> 30:57.179
Enough. You're one woman in the middle
of a storm against the four of us.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.564
It doesn't end well for you, Grace.

30:59.733 --> 31:01.474
<i>What's that, Billy?</i>

31:01.651 --> 31:03.392
<i>Billy, you okay?</i>

31:03.570 --> 31:04.936
That's a stupid question.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.901
You're not okay
because my name's not Grace.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.153
It's Elizabeth.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.077
<i>You wanted to know about my past?</i>

31:13.747 --> 31:16.160
<i>I was an FBI agent.</i>

31:16.666 --> 31:18.828
<i>A profiler.</i>

31:19.252 --> 31:22.290
And I smelled you out the minute
you walked in my door.

31:22.923 --> 31:28.009
That's why I froze broken glass
into those ice cubes you love to chew.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.760
<i>So now every time you breathe...</i>

31:29.930 --> 31:34.721
<i>...you're inhaling those little shards
deeper into your throat and lungs.</i>

31:39.064 --> 31:40.100
You're dead.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.354
<i>No, Bill.</i>

31:41.525 --> 31:44.734
For the first time, I'm feeling alive.
So if you wanna come for me...

31:44.903 --> 31:47.065
...you better come ready for a fight.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.949
<i>Because you know what the four of you
against me in the woods is gonna be?</i>

31:51.118 --> 31:52.234
Practice.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.540
<i>- She's one person.
- She was an FBI agent.</i>

32:03.713 --> 32:06.797
- She's alone.
- She fed you glass.

32:18.728 --> 32:21.721
- It was her.
- How? She's not even in here.

32:22.983 --> 32:24.599
She drugged him.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.143
- She drugged the food.
- With what?

32:27.320 --> 32:29.061
Does it matter? It worked.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.196
What are we gonna do?

32:34.995 --> 32:37.738
You remember that money launderer
down in Palmdale?

32:37.914 --> 32:39.496
Squatting in that shack?

32:42.544 --> 32:44.752
He was dug in like a tick.

32:47.257 --> 32:49.123
Same thing here.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.590
We surround her...

32:51.428 --> 32:53.670
...and we tighten the noose.

33:13.575 --> 33:15.407
What the hell? What's going on?

33:15.577 --> 33:17.944
- Get over here.
- Get this thing off me.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.033
- Come on.
- Grab him. Grab that side.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.823
Damn it, pull.

33:28.548 --> 33:29.755
She can't get far.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.425
Whole damn mountain's frozen solid.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.587
Guys, we got a problem.

33:40.435 --> 33:41.551
Even better.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.221
Now she's got cargo.

33:44.981 --> 33:47.064
She'll be twice as slow.

35:05.687 --> 35:08.395
It's okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.522
We're gonna get you some help.

35:43.516 --> 35:46.975
From one professional to another,
you're pretty good.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.973
I told my guys tonight would be easy.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.818
Hunker down, wait out the storm.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.228
Lie to the lady.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.192
You can apologize to them soon.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.908
But you're all out of tricks now.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.240
You're all out of traps.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.370
I promised them I'd kill you.

36:07.540 --> 36:08.621
Slow.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.983
It's over.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.783
- Nowhere left to run.
- Who's running?

36:44.953 --> 36:47.195
I told you, I'm here to fight.

37:21.364 --> 37:24.072
<i>I don't know how to explain any of this.</i>

37:24.242 --> 37:26.359
<i>The carnage, the death.</i>

37:26.536 --> 37:30.155
<i>I mean, what happened up there
at that house...</i>

37:30.331 --> 37:33.324
<i>...it's bizarre.</i>

37:34.127 --> 37:38.292
<i>We have bodies, men murdered,
drugged, burned alive.</i>

37:38.465 --> 37:40.252
<i>Known criminals
with extensive records.</i>

37:40.425 --> 37:43.634
<i>And the woman,
the one we believe is responsible...</i>

37:43.803 --> 37:45.669
<i>...we have no idea who she was.</i>

37:45.847 --> 37:46.883
<i>Grace.</i>

37:47.056 --> 37:48.968
<i>Nice woman. Kind of quiet.</i>

37:49.142 --> 37:51.099
Kept to herself.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.510
Paid cash.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.269
Did "Grace" have a last name?

37:54.439 --> 37:57.557
Talbot. At least that's how it said it
on the side of the packages.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.225
Which she picked up here.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.143
Sure, one every few weeks.

38:01.321 --> 38:02.903
Now and then, off and on.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.906
She didn't get too excited about it,
got them all eventually.

38:06.075 --> 38:09.284
- No idea where the packages went?
- At the house, I suppose.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.946
- Are they not there?
<i>- Let's pivot.</i>

38:12.123 --> 38:13.910
I'd like to talk about Mr. Elroy.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.415
The federal witness.

38:15.585 --> 38:18.999
He said he was dropped off at the ER
like a Christmas gift.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.585
That's right.
That's what the head nurse said.

38:21.758 --> 38:25.126
Left him there on the doorstep
of the medical center in Delta Junction.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.920
- She saved his life.
- She knew he was someone important.

38:28.097 --> 38:31.932
This woman didn't just wander off. She
made sure not to leave evidence behind.

38:32.101 --> 38:36.311
Not a Kleenex in the trash, or a fingerprint
in the barn, or a hair in a drain. Not one.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.347
- The place was wiped clean.
- So clean...

38:38.525 --> 38:41.484
...she may have learned
how to clean a scene from a pro.

38:42.195 --> 38:45.814
- I don't understand the question.
- You saw her, you spoke to her.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.028
You tell me who you think she was.

38:48.201 --> 38:51.285
- I don't know.
- I wish I could say.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.491
I think she was...

38:53.665 --> 38:55.156
A ghost.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.704
Life's full of them.

39:43.256 --> 39:46.715
Elizabeth. Please come in.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.983
You look strong.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.564
I'm healed.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.564
I wanna thank you.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.690
What for?

40:13.286 --> 40:15.403
For honoring your promise.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.913
I know it wasn't easy for you.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.662
It was what you wanted.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.625
I also wanna apologize.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.540
Why?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.510
I couldn't honor mine.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.058
I tried.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.602
I really did.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.898
I didn't go looking for trouble.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.936
But it found me.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.531
And I'm glad it did.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.784
What happened?

40:56.579 --> 40:58.241
I killed some men.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.204
It doesn't matter that they were bad.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.627
That it was them or me.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.918
What matters is that I did it,
and I was good at it.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.053
And I didn't lose any sleep over it.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.507
You will.

41:18.685 --> 41:21.052
One of these nights, you will.

41:21.688 --> 41:24.101
It's just a matter of when.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.224
Maybe.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.603
Later.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.069
After I've crossed the abyss.

41:36.744 --> 41:38.701
But from the side I'm on now...

41:38.871 --> 41:44.287
...all that matters is that I'm healed,
and I'm back.

41:44.627 --> 41:46.710
And I'm coming for Tom's killers.

41:49.257 --> 41:52.796
Like I said, I couldn't keep my promise.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.424
Can you forgive me?

42:10.069 --> 42:11.651
Yes.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.993
Will you be able to forgive yourself?
