WEBVTT

00:08.425 --> 00:11.928
On this episode we're off
to sunny Palm Springs, California.

00:12.012 --> 00:12.929
Hi.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.390
To a home like you've never seen before.

00:15.473 --> 00:16.306
Wow.

00:16.391 --> 00:20.311
We have been transported
in a time machine to 1970.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.397
The new owners of this '70s-style home

00:22.480 --> 00:25.191
want it on the rental market
as soon as possible.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.445
This house should be shared
with the world.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.448
But before they open the door
to guests, they need our help

00:31.531 --> 00:33.158
to fix some major problems...

00:33.241 --> 00:36.036
-Here's your turkey.
-This is kind of grim.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.328
...with design...

00:37.412 --> 00:40.540
This is our interior project
that needs the most work.

00:40.623 --> 00:41.708
...with privacy...

00:41.791 --> 00:43.126
You got the noise detectors in.

00:43.209 --> 00:46.129
...and overcoming their fear
of renting their new baby.

00:46.212 --> 00:49.090
I just don't want somebody
throwing up on the carpet.

00:49.591 --> 00:53.136
We'll give 'em the push to get
ready as the most outrageously distinct

00:53.219 --> 00:55.180
vacation rental in the desert.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.348
-I'd stay here.
-I'd stay here too.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.410 --> 01:19.829
I love the desert.

01:22.957 --> 01:26.377
-It's the last frontier of L.A., really.
-Well, it's two hours from L.A.

01:26.461 --> 01:31.049
But what speaks loudest, for me,
is just the design and style.

01:31.132 --> 01:35.845
-Right.
-This town is defined by its architecture.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.390
I mean, if you're into mid-century modern
property, this is like an orgasmatron.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.851
-This is Mecca of mid-century--
-Yeah, totally.

01:44.604 --> 01:49.359
Palm Springs has
over 12.8 million sunseekers each year

01:49.442 --> 01:52.487
traveling to enjoy outdoor activities
like golf and tennis,

01:52.570 --> 01:54.989
or visit the world-famous
music and art festival.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.493
In the short-term rental game,
there are over 5,300 rental properties

01:58.576 --> 02:01.329
in the Coachella Valley, which is where
Palm Springs is located.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.833
They generate about $169 million
for homeowners.

02:04.916 --> 02:09.920
The average nightly rate is about $351,
but the property we're going to transform

02:10.003 --> 02:12.841
is not even close to being
considered average.

02:12.924 --> 02:16.010
-You want this piece of steak?
-I can't eat a steak right now.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.304
I can eat a steak breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.640
As you know, we looked
at hundreds and hundreds of places.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.101
Let's talk about the vacation rental
that needs our help.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.562
I wanted to show you pictures,
I'm not sure if you saw these.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.646
What?

02:26.729 --> 02:32.068
It's almost like we have been
transported in a time machine to 1970.

02:32.861 --> 02:36.656
This is done so well.
And it's just so cool looking.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.200
They bought this house
about six months ago.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.452
They've been renovating it
in the '70s syle,

02:41.536 --> 02:43.872
getting it ready to start
their vacation rental business.

02:43.955 --> 02:48.668
It feels like the owners have got it
to a certain point on the remodel.

02:48.751 --> 02:52.589
And then they kind of got stuck and they
need your help finishing the design.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.383
Like all the work that needs to be done
in the kitchen.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.719
Right. And it's one of the areas we're
gonna have to focus

02:57.802 --> 03:00.013
on getting it to match
the rest of the house.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.765
In fact, the owners
have already gutted it.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.810
-And then the backyard, it feels a bit--
-Dead.

03:07.061 --> 03:08.771
Like concrete jungle.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.525
I think it's definitely in vogue
right now, the '70s.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.696
So if we can get the pool and the kitchen
to match the rest of the house,

03:16.779 --> 03:18.656
this could be a great rental.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.867
For sure.
I think the ingredients are there.

03:20.950 --> 03:24.495
'Cause I've never seen anything like it,
but like so many first timers,

03:24.579 --> 03:27.290
they're so nervous about people
damaging the property.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.710
It's that trust economy.
How do you trust people with your baby?

03:30.793 --> 03:33.504
-Well, we can help them with that.
-I agree.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.311
That's a million-dollar backdrop
right there.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.689
-That's Palm Springs in a nutshell.
-It's beautiful.

03:52.273 --> 03:57.320
It's kind of a mishmash of mid-century
lines with some Hollywood Regency.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.948
It's a really unique blend.

04:00.031 --> 04:03.743
I think in this scenario, I'll be more
like a coach,

04:03.826 --> 04:05.828
'cause they have been
renovating for quite a while.

04:05.912 --> 04:09.540
But of course they're going to need to be
pushed just like everyone else.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.292
-Hi!
-Hi!

04:11.960 --> 04:12.794
You made it.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.505
-So happy you guys are here.
-We're happy to be here.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.923
-My name is Jess.
-And I'm Ryan.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.468
Our primary residence is in New York.

04:20.551 --> 04:24.514
We also spend a lot of time in California
for work.

04:24.597 --> 04:29.018
We bought this mid-century house
about six months ago as a second home.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.187
And we have not rented it out yet.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.483
And we have been doing stuff to be able
to rent this out as soon as possible.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.319
-Talk about this beast of a house.
-Yes.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.863
It hasn't been touched since 1969.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.074
What are your goals by the time you leave?

04:43.157 --> 04:45.618
The number one goal is to have this
ready to rent.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.705
But also, we have a shared passion
for this house.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.709
And we feel we have a certain level
of responsibility to take care of it.

04:52.792 --> 04:56.087
And so it's it's important that the right
people are staying here.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.756
You want quality renters
as opposed to volume.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.301
What are the big problems
that you're facing

05:01.384 --> 05:04.012
in getting this together
as a guest rental?

05:04.095 --> 05:07.598
We feel like we really need
to concentrate on the landscaping,

05:07.682 --> 05:11.728
backyard and kitchen and getting those
elevated so they match

05:11.811 --> 05:12.937
the rest of the house.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.440
Exterior-wise, what do you think
is your problem?

05:15.523 --> 05:18.192
-Yeah, so--
-It's brown.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.986
-Yeah, I agree. Putty.
-Yes.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.198
And this front yard,
we want to make this usable space,

05:24.282 --> 05:25.283
with some privacy.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.701
Yep. Okay.

05:26.784 --> 05:32.373
We have gotten the house to a certain
point and I think we're ready for them

05:32.457 --> 05:36.044
to come in and just shower their expertise
all over this place

05:36.127 --> 05:38.004
and really take it to the next level.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.213
We're ready to go.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.923
-Can we go in?
-Yes.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.469
-I'm dying to get inside. I'll follow you.
-Yeah, me too. Let's do it.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.187
God! Wow!

05:54.270 --> 05:56.314
-I'm like emotional overload.
-I gotta--

05:56.397 --> 06:00.401
Everything is original other than a few
of the pieces on the top of the table

06:00.485 --> 06:01.319
which we bought.

06:01.402 --> 06:04.405
I feel like we're in an amusement park.
What's next?

06:04.489 --> 06:08.659
-All right, let's go!
-This is just so intense.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.371
-Oh, my God.
-So, this is the dining room.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.289
-Oh, my God!
-Okay.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.667
Every room is a punch in the face.
It's like boom.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.503
-Yeah!
-What!

06:18.586 --> 06:21.130
-This is the blue room!
-This is bonkers.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.423
Oh, my God,

06:25.635 --> 06:28.679
I'm not touching this room.
I can tell you that right now.

06:28.763 --> 06:34.143
I am in 1970, right? You have
authentically delivered the fairy tale.

06:34.227 --> 06:39.107
And this is definitely the selfie moment
of the house against this pink upholstery.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.484
-Yes, wow.
-Yes.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.486
Block everything.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.405
The tub is amazing.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.865
These rooms are practically perfect.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.700
They just need some accessories.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.078
Take me to your turkeys.
Where's the big problems?

06:53.371 --> 06:56.040
-So...
-Here's your turkey.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.750
-Yeah.
-Yes.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.963
Okay. This outdoor--  Well, there
really isn't any experience, is there?

07:02.046 --> 07:04.507
I mean, the experience is kind of grim.

07:04.590 --> 07:08.428
I come through the house and it's like,
wow, big experiences.

07:08.511 --> 07:13.141
Totally kind of like multi-colored
like orgasmic trip through the house.

07:13.224 --> 07:16.310
I come outside, I feel like
I'm in a different home.

07:16.394 --> 07:21.315
When your guests exit here,
they need to hit the hotel resort pool.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.608
-Yes.
-The Shangri-La.

07:22.692 --> 07:28.156
Architecturally, our goal is to make
this entire house feel alive.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.533
Just how it might have felt back in 1969.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.328
-Wow!
-It's pretty sweet.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.497
We're not gonna touch much
in here, right?

07:36.581 --> 07:39.041
I mean, these are all original pieces.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.294
We also have a very naked
fireplace over there.

07:41.878 --> 07:45.756
Looks like you've demo'd,  but do you
have any stone to reface it with?

07:45.840 --> 07:48.468
We had black granite that was here
when we bought it

07:48.551 --> 07:51.929
and we always were wanting
to put authentic rock,

07:52.013 --> 07:55.308
-back in, you know, the '60s and '70s--
-Kind of like the exterior of the house.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.769
Exactly, and that specific rock, there's
a house in this neighborhood

07:58.853 --> 08:03.399
down the street that's become dilapidated
and we were driving past it one day

08:03.483 --> 08:05.985
-and we saw all this rock in this dumpster
-No!

08:06.068 --> 08:09.197
I talked to the foreman. We made a quick
deal and they started moving the rock

08:09.280 --> 08:10.323
down here on wheelbarrows.

08:10.406 --> 08:16.704
Super cool. So that's gonna be completely
staggery, natural texture, nothing smooth.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.164
-Correct?
-That's right.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.501
Gen can totally give this room
a little punch.

08:21.584 --> 08:25.254
If I'm renting this spot, I'm hanging out
in this room all the time.

08:25.338 --> 08:29.842
But I also want to feel like
I'm not in 1970.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.053
-I'm just booking 1970.
-Right.

08:32.135 --> 08:34.263
So I want some tech.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.183
So let's talk about wi-fi.

08:37.265 --> 08:41.729
When they built it, it was drywall,
concrete, drywall, concrete.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.650
The wi-fi is is so terrible
all over the house.

08:45.733 --> 08:50.071
So if somebody from your team can figure
that out for us, that would be amazing.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.614
Don't worry. We've got you covered.

08:52.573 --> 08:57.328
So this is our interior project
that clearly needs the most work.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.414
-Yes.
-This is further along than I thought.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.959
I remember seeing the pictures
of the kitchen.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.460
-I have them here.
-Oh, yeah.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.838
-What wasn't working about the kitchen?
-It was a rendition,

09:07.922 --> 09:10.758
some time, I believe,
in the late '80s, early '90s.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.844
There are some things
that should stay in the past.

09:13.928 --> 09:14.929
Agreed.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.932
So let's talk about what this
is going to become.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.684
You're gonna have a huge island here.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.561
I see all of your water set up.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.188
And it'll be big enough
for four bar stools.

09:24.272 --> 09:28.442
We're gonna have cabinetry and appliances
all along this big wall.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.152
Yep, refrigerator goes there.

09:30.236 --> 09:33.739
We found the coolest appliances.
They look like they were made in the '70s.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.075
The kitchen will feel
like it's from an era...

09:36.158 --> 09:37.243
-Yeah.
-...gone by.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.744
-But yet, up to today's--
-Correct.

09:38.828 --> 09:39.662
Exactly.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.873
When people are booking
a vacation rental, it's the experience.

09:42.957 --> 09:46.043
They want to treat your home like
a mini-resort.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.296
And Gen is going to make this place sing,

09:48.379 --> 09:52.258
so that we can get this '70s classic
on the vacation rental market.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.884
I've never been in a property

09:53.968 --> 09:56.596
that's as much of a time capsule
in this era as this is.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.847
Yeah, me neither.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.600
The thing that drives real estate
and drives short-term rentals,

10:00.683 --> 10:03.728
and drives everything to do
with accommodations is comps.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.898
You guys are one ship alone in the ocean.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.776
-There's no comps.
-You have no competition.

10:11.235 --> 10:15.823
So with a property like this that has
a very distinct message and story,

10:16.365 --> 10:19.201
I think we should really lean into that
on the marketing.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.202
Sure.

10:20.286 --> 10:24.624
So let's talk about numbers. There are
lots of homes on Airbnb and various sites,

10:24.707 --> 10:28.794
and private websites and they range
from $500 to $3,500 a night.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.214
So one that's $500 a night
is an okay mid-century.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.842
One that's 3,500
is at the top of the hill.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.303
Killer views across the valley.
Perfect Pool.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.305
-Everything is...
-To the nines, yeah.

10:39.388 --> 10:42.808
To the nines. At the end of the day,
the market dictates the price.

10:42.892 --> 10:48.105
Because you have no reviews, if it was
my place and this was my business,

10:48.189 --> 10:49.815
I would take under 1,000.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.818
Then the market will speak. If you don't
get any bookings, you're too high.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.363
And if you get loads of bookings,
you jack it up.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.947
Yeah, that makes sense.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.325
Your monthly expenses on this
are 4,500 bucks.

10:59.408 --> 11:04.288
So if we go with the recommended 995,
call it 1,000,

11:04.372 --> 11:07.792
that's five nights you would need
to book it a month,

11:08.334 --> 11:10.711
and you would be approximately
$500 in profit.

11:11.420 --> 11:17.051
You are so committed to the preservation
of this era, this house specifically.

11:17.134 --> 11:21.931
My big question for you is, are you
going to trust anyone to stay here?

11:22.014 --> 11:23.849
Because this is your baby.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.144
I think that's something we really wanted
to talk with you guys about,

11:27.228 --> 11:32.441
is a vetting process that will work
because we don't want it to get trashed.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.696
So how do we find the people that are
gonna appreciate it as much as we do?

11:36.779 --> 11:39.615
Fortunately, I'm going to have you meet
some people

11:39.699 --> 11:44.078
that can help with the vetting process
and actually represent luxury properties

11:44.161 --> 11:45.746
-in Palm Springs.
-Great.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.998
And we're gonna get you
some tech devices in here

11:48.082 --> 11:50.418
that will help you monitor your property
from New York.

11:50.501 --> 11:54.630
The last thing we want isn't some
Axl Rose comes in the house

11:54.714 --> 11:57.758
and decides to party like a rock star.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.885
You're throwing your hero under the bus.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.264
He is my hero and I do miss those types
of rock stars.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.182
I just don't want them in this home.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.310
This house should be shared
with the world.

12:08.894 --> 12:13.023
And so, I'm excited to share it
with people who will appreciate it.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.943
It's like having a great kid
that's ready to go to college.

12:16.026 --> 12:19.530
You're like, "It's time to be shared
with the world."

12:28.914 --> 12:31.459
For this outrageously
distinct property to succeed,

12:31.542 --> 12:34.003
we need to get every aspect of it
to match the era,

12:34.086 --> 12:36.338
while still offering modern amenities.

12:36.422 --> 12:40.009
To do that, Genevieve is going to help
complete the kitchen, the pool,

12:40.092 --> 12:42.762
and create an exterior experience
at the property.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.182
Then we'll add modern technology
throughout the house

12:46.265 --> 12:48.142
to meet guests'
expectations.

12:49.393 --> 12:52.938
Finally, we'll introduce them to a luxury
property management company

12:53.022 --> 12:55.232
that can help vet potential renters.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.073
It's day two and we've got a ton going on.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.618
We have the exterior being painted
on both sides.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.287
And the kitchen
is headed back to the '70s.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.250
Starting with a gutted kitchen,  we're
going to add an island for meal prep,

13:13.334 --> 13:16.045
a dining area, modern appliances
with a vintage look,

13:16.128 --> 13:19.757
and most importantly,
'70s-inspired wood cabinetry.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.850
These look great.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.353
This is so much better than 1970.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.688
Era-specific is the color.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.609
2018 is the feel and the function.

13:38.692 --> 13:41.237
When the hardware goes on especially,
these are really gonna pop.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.780
No, they're gorgeous.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.704
-Whoa.
-Whoa!

13:52.206 --> 13:54.166
Wow!

13:54.250 --> 13:56.877
That is a pretty car.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.464
This is a 1974 Rolls Royce Silver Shadow.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.967
We've been restoring it for the last
two and a half years

14:03.050 --> 14:05.719
This is how
you need to pick up the guests.

14:05.803 --> 14:09.890
And then the up-charge that you charge
for using the Rolls Royce

14:09.974 --> 14:12.601
will more than cover the insurance
and will add to your bottom line.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.353
It's like riding a couch.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.273
Bye, Peter.

14:18.315 --> 14:23.946
If you're a mid-century lover,
there are so many great shops.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.869
Palm Springs is one of
the most influential locations

14:29.952 --> 14:32.872
in the world for mid
and post-century modern design.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.708
Today, the design aesthetic
is still prevalent in the area,

14:35.791 --> 14:38.460
which means there are
a lot of great stores to find furniture

14:38.544 --> 14:40.462
and accessories for our property.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.427
Thank you.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.930
-This is a fun place.
-We love it.

14:50.014 --> 14:53.267
I want you to really look
for era-specific,

14:53.350 --> 14:56.145
because anything that we do that isn't
quite right

14:56.228 --> 14:59.273
is going to stand out as really wrong.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.484
There's your color.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.447
That's fun.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.658
-I like it.
-I like it and they feel very '70s.

15:10.659 --> 15:12.578
What about these chairs, you guys?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.915
-The green ones with the circles.
-Those are interesting.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.667
-Can they be painted?
-Painted or recovered.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.086
But look at the bones,
'cause this is similar to your table.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.672
-The bones are awesome.
-These are great.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.758
Let's think about these
as maybe dining chairs.

15:26.216 --> 15:29.011
-It fits in but it also feels good.
-Yeah.

15:31.013 --> 15:31.847
Here it is.

15:32.598 --> 15:36.977
Honestly, I have loved this image
for years and years and years.

15:37.061 --> 15:43.233
Slim Aarons is this amazing photographer
that shoots these romantic photographs.

15:43.317 --> 15:48.989
It feels exactly like the type of scene
that we hope our guests come and feel

15:49.073 --> 15:50.866
when they are staying in this home.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.868
Let me read you what it says.

15:52.952 --> 15:57.206
"A poolside party at a desert house
in Palm Springs, 1970."

15:57.873 --> 15:59.917
I do like that umbrella in the back.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.671
It's a Palm Springs party in 1970
with the designers that you idolize.

16:03.754 --> 16:07.299
We have to make your backyard
feel as cool as this photograph.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.426
There's nothing really more appropriate.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.769
Now that we selected some key elements
for my shopping trip,

16:18.852 --> 16:21.146
my design inspiration is coming together.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.400
I'm reviewing the owners'
personal collection of accessories

16:24.483 --> 16:27.319
they've gathered over the years
and through my curation,

16:27.403 --> 16:30.489
I'm going to use the items to create
beautiful vignettes throughout the house

16:30.572 --> 16:32.741
that will create a sense
of time and place.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.286
All design decisions will focus towards
the goal of making this home

16:36.370 --> 16:39.581
feel beautifully intentional
and super era-specific.

16:41.917 --> 16:45.379
This is so cool and it looks so hard.

16:45.462 --> 16:50.050
Well, we're trying to match
the '60s-era chimney.

16:50.134 --> 16:53.053
You don't see this anymore, versus
the stuff that you get now,

16:53.137 --> 16:55.556
-you just stack--
-You just stack it.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.308
Yeah, this is more--
You have to see which rock fits.

16:58.392 --> 17:01.103
You gotta step back, look at it.
All right, that looks good there.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.230
-You've got to be an artist.
-You gotta be an artist.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.482
But at least the outcome
looks real cool.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.527
-It's really cool.
-A lot better than using the fake stuff.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.950
Got it. Got it.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.371
We've unloaded
110 ten-foot ficus trees

17:19.454 --> 17:22.124
around the entire property for privacy

17:22.207 --> 17:24.667
to completely transform
the exterior space.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.464
By doing this, we created privacy
around the entire property

17:28.547 --> 17:31.717
and made the front yard
more usable as outdoor living space.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.886
By adding seating,

17:34.636 --> 17:35.763
games, and a fire pit,

17:36.138 --> 17:39.349
this also helps push the '70s
Hollywood Regency style

17:39.433 --> 17:43.062
seen at several of the high-end hotels
in the Palm Springs area.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.107
Also in the back yard, we're going to put
in synthetic grass around the pool

17:47.191 --> 17:50.652
and do everything we can to give this
a more embellished look.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.491
Peter, you want to see the grass
that's going in?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.743
This is a breathable back,
permeable back

17:57.826 --> 18:00.746
and you put this right on top of this
little backer board

18:00.829 --> 18:02.414
and you have proper drainage.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.793
So we're going to cover all the floor
around the pool.

18:05.876 --> 18:10.923
What it does is it does give the whole
pool area a much more luxurious look.

18:11.006 --> 18:14.051
This is already a thousand times better.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.386
These are tips to increase property value.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.889
They're gonna have that complete
Palm Springs '70s experience

18:18.972 --> 18:20.307
continue from the house out here.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.684
They're going to have
a second home outside.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.228
Boom! Love it.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.693
Second part of our business goal
is bringing the home's technology

18:31.777 --> 18:33.529
into the 21st century.

18:35.447 --> 18:40.494
We're switching this digital panel
for a smart home version thermostat.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.914
Brilliant. Saves you time and money.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.958
-So what I like about this is--
-Let me see.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.002
It's new technology.
It's a system of hubs.

18:49.086 --> 18:52.673
Have 'em clumped all over the house.
They'll talk to each other.

18:53.006 --> 18:56.260
-Great wi-fi.
-And it's cute, so I can handle it.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.262
-Where you gonna put it?
-I think right here.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.931
I think you let the designer
just put it where we put it.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.685
-Discreet.
-I've got two more to place in the house.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.979
I'm going with you,
'cause you're not doing that again.

19:07.062 --> 19:07.896
Okay.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.358
With wi-fi up and running,
we can now install security cameras

19:11.441 --> 19:12.484
on the front of the house,

19:12.568 --> 19:15.070
so the homeowners can verify
when guests check-in.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.030
Another wire's gonna go that way.

19:17.114 --> 19:21.410
When installing security cameras at your
shert-term rental, it is common courtesy,

19:21.493 --> 19:23.287
you've got to let the guests know.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.625
Finally, guests will also be notified when
booking that we installed noise detectors

19:28.709 --> 19:31.545
throughout the property to help prevent
crazy partiess

19:31.628 --> 19:33.714
that could upset the neighbors
or damage the house.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.966
You got the noise detectors in?

19:36.049 --> 19:37.759
We just installed one right here.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.345
Okay, brilliant.
Can you tell me how it works?

19:40.429 --> 19:44.474
Sure. It is a noise monitoring system
for a vacation rental home.

19:45.058 --> 19:48.604
The product works just like a smoke
detector, but for noise.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.772
We're measuring noise levels.

19:50.856 --> 19:56.195
And when it gets too loud, it's gonna
notify you either by SMS or email.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.573
So when you're getting a notification,
means there might be a party at your house

19:59.656 --> 20:02.242
and we allow you to be preventative
about that issue.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.412
I love it. I mean, this to me,
is a no-brainer.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.247
I'm dying to see where you put 'em.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.926
We've got the rest of the day
to finish getting back to the '70s

20:19.009 --> 20:23.555
before we transport Ryan and Jessica
back to their property.

20:23.639 --> 20:27.267
In the kitchen, we're bringing in modern
appliances with a vintage look...

20:27.351 --> 20:28.769
Just hold it. Yeah, go up.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.688
...hanging custom wallpaper...

20:32.314 --> 20:35.567
-I'm a fan of this.
-...and laying yellow Moroccan tile.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.613
In the den, we're completing
the rock fireplace

20:39.696 --> 20:42.407
and installing retro shag
wall to wall carpet.

20:44.034 --> 20:47.412
And before the sun sets, I'm out shopping
for some outdoor furniture

20:47.496 --> 20:50.499
that will make the backyard feel
like the rest of the house.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.751
That umbrella is everything.

21:06.181 --> 21:10.227
One of Jessica and Ryan's goals for this
week was to get their property listed

21:10.310 --> 21:13.355
on an exclusive
vacation rental property website.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.483
There are tons of these websites around
the globe and they are usually run

21:16.566 --> 21:20.529
by a property management company that
can also help vet potential customers.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.282
So we brought our homeowners
to a classic steak dinner

21:23.365 --> 21:26.660
to meet one of the top property
management companies in Palm Springs.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.830
-Yes, bone marrow!
-Wow.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.248
Yum.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.666
-Yum!
-Thank you.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.335
Now that we've been served
this fabulous dinner,

21:35.419 --> 21:36.962
We wanted you to meet Mike.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.965
He represents the most exclusive
properties in the valley

21:40.048 --> 21:41.216
here in Palm Springs.

21:41.300 --> 21:46.346
The home really is the only property
I've ever seen that has been preserved

21:46.930 --> 21:49.599
in this manner, especially
in the pink bedroom.

21:49.683 --> 21:50.976
-Yes!
-Yes!

21:51.852 --> 21:54.479
Tell us a little bit more
about the vetting process.

21:54.563 --> 21:58.066
We have our own website. After they make
the booking, we call them.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.320
We send out a video
on using vacation rental homes

22:01.403 --> 22:02.404
and they have to watch it

22:02.487 --> 22:05.240
and the other people in their group
have to watch it as well.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.993
And then once they arrive,
then a concierge meets them

22:08.076 --> 22:11.747
at the home and makes sure that they
are who they said they are.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.666
I think it's just gonna take
doing it a few times, right?

22:14.750 --> 22:18.378
Yes. We have a lot of pieces that we have,
you know, acquired over time.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.631
And if any one of those pieces
were to go missing--

22:21.715 --> 22:26.219
Anything up to $3,000-4,000,
depending on the plan, will be paid.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.889
-Is there a way to up that?
-Sure.

22:28.972 --> 22:32.684
Can you give Jess and Ryan an idea
of just how many deals go bad?

22:32.768 --> 22:37.189
In the last two years,
we have put 20,000 guests in homes.

22:37.272 --> 22:40.484
Over all of those rentals,
we've had two problems,

22:40.567 --> 22:43.695
but not the Armageddon scenario
that you imagine.

22:43.779 --> 22:47.824
So, we're the quality control
so you don't have to be.

22:47.908 --> 22:51.078
I think the stats that Mike was able
to share with us

22:51.161 --> 22:52.954
pass with flying colors so to speak.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.791
I feel like we're
setting up marriage every week.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.876
It's like so heartwarming.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.762
Yes.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.476
-Good. That's when you need to stay away.
-Oh, my God, look at that.

23:14.559 --> 23:18.105
-Cucumber sandwiches.
-AKA 1970s America.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.731
Ready for photos, do you think?

23:19.815 --> 23:22.818
Two seconds. Let me get the fondue stuff
going and then we're ready to go.

23:26.029 --> 23:29.324
I want to really hammer home
that 1970 experience.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.577
Capture the bar through the fireplace.

23:34.329 --> 23:36.706
That orange decanter as focal point.

23:37.791 --> 23:38.792
Can I see one?

23:39.918 --> 23:42.295
That is so great.

23:44.464 --> 23:48.760
This is my favorite part. We get to bring
Ryan and Jessica home

23:48.844 --> 23:50.512
to see their new vacation rental.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.265
I think they are gonna go bonkers
when they see this.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.733
Oh, my gosh, I can't wait. I'm dying.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.527
This should be interesting.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.990
Ready! One, two, three!

24:14.744 --> 24:17.289
-Wow.
-It's awesome.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.417
-The gold is--
-It's incredible.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.545
-Totally insane.
-Rock wall against the white, amazing.

24:23.628 --> 24:27.132
Look at the hanging chairs.
We can play croquet.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.177
You have doubled
your recreational area now.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.094
-Yes.
-Yes.

24:31.511 --> 24:33.513
This was wasted space before.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.391
I know.
There was nowhere to just hang out.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.434
You got privacy.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.603
It feels luxurious
when you create privacy.

24:39.686 --> 24:40.812
Totally. Absolutely.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.815
So what are you guys
most excited to see first?

24:43.899 --> 24:44.858
-Kitchen.
-The kitchen.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.610
So why don't we start there?

24:47.611 --> 24:50.238
Three, two, one!

24:55.744 --> 24:58.163
It looks so nice.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.708
Wow.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.211
Yes!

25:05.837 --> 25:07.714
The chandelier looks fantastic.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.383
Look at our range. Look at this!

25:11.259 --> 25:12.385
It's so pretty.

25:13.136 --> 25:15.680
So tell us a little bit about
what it looked like.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.099
Or what it felt like.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.185
It felt super sad.

25:20.727 --> 25:25.357
Now you have a radically different
kitchen that you picked most of the stuff

25:25.440 --> 25:26.691
before we even got here.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.943
-See your photograph?
-Wow.

25:28.610 --> 25:32.447
It's awesome. I've wanted
that photograph for like ten years.

25:32.531 --> 25:36.868
For us, the dream was to have a home that
captures everything that you feel

25:36.952 --> 25:38.954
when you look at that photograph.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.164
Look at your chairs that used to be green.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.167
I literally did not make the connection
that these were the same chairs.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.337
They look awesome.
The kitchen just turned out amazing.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.173
It is so bright and cheery

25:50.257 --> 25:52.842
We accomplished
what we were setting out to do.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.137
For us nerdy guys and gals, voilà!

25:56.221 --> 25:58.974
So, when guests check-in, they're going
to come into the kitchen

25:59.057 --> 26:01.560
you've got all of these things to do,

26:01.643 --> 26:05.313
places to eat,
places to shop, places to play.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.566
I thought the guide
was such a nice surprise.

26:07.649 --> 26:11.653
I just takes away any question marks
about-- What are we going to do later

26:11.736 --> 26:13.572
or where are we
going to have dinner tonight?

26:13.655 --> 26:15.740
It's like, check,
we're going to have dinner there.

26:15.824 --> 26:16.950
Here's your den.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.912
It's so...

26:21.663 --> 26:25.125
-Go.
-Look at this.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.544
-The fondue set.
-Hey.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.754
I know. This is nice.

26:29.838 --> 26:34.968
flat carpet with a flat naked couch.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.261
You brought in the shag.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.597
I brought in a lot of different
textures on your couch

26:38.680 --> 26:41.141
to make that like a story in itself.

26:41.224 --> 26:45.729
And then you guys salvaged
this beautiful rock to build a fireplace.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.648
So quintessentially this era.

26:48.732 --> 26:52.444
-It looks awesome.
-They did, I think, an exquisite job.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.696
The den just makes me smile.

26:55.196 --> 26:56.031
Oh, yeah.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.783
I want to hang out in that den
for the rest of my life.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.910
The one thing that was ruining this room--

27:00.994 --> 27:04.581
You have sexy, beautiful, powerful wi-fi

27:04.664 --> 27:09.294
so people can have a social media posting
orgasm in your house.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.713
-You are flexing on wi-fi. Flexing.
-Awesome.

27:11.796 --> 27:15.425
And we installed sound meters.

27:15.508 --> 27:19.137
If people are in here partying too hard,
you'll be alerted on your phone.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.264
You can politely send them a text
or call them up.

27:21.348 --> 27:24.267
There is a level of comfort that's
already starting to set in.

27:24.351 --> 27:28.271
I do think that our concerns have been
eased a bit throughout this process.

27:28.355 --> 27:33.234
-One, two, three! Open your eyes.
-Open!

27:38.698 --> 27:41.660
Oh, my God!

27:43.119 --> 27:45.580
Oh, my God, you guys!

27:45.664 --> 27:49.250
-This is incredible.
-It is so good!

27:51.336 --> 27:54.381
Just for giggles,
can we just recall what was here?

27:55.840 --> 27:58.259
Just bleak cement madness.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.387
-It feels like a mini resort.
-What do you think?

28:00.470 --> 28:02.263
I think my face hurts from smiling.

28:02.347 --> 28:05.975
-It's so fun!
-Yeah.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.106
You picked the grass, the ficus.

28:11.189 --> 28:15.026
And so now, when you're sitting by
the pool, all you see are the mountaintops

28:15.110 --> 28:17.570
-instead of your neighbor--
-I want to feel it on my feet.

28:17.654 --> 28:18.613
Do it!

28:19.739 --> 28:21.241
Feel and touch everything.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.909
Awesome.

28:22.992 --> 28:23.993
Oh, yeah,

28:24.786 --> 28:28.206
after everything we've learned, the ways
that we can protect the house

28:28.289 --> 28:31.376
and vet our guests,
we're very excited to rent it out.

28:31.459 --> 28:34.337
It's a pretty awesome space
that we look forward to using

28:34.421 --> 28:36.423
and having other people enjoy it too.

28:36.506 --> 28:41.469
It's pretty safe to say that you are now
going to be seriously in profit.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.056
So, you guys were very reserved
at the beginning of the week.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.892
Right? We've given you
the tools to let go.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.478
How could we not share this
with other people?

28:50.562 --> 28:52.313
That would be a little bit selfish,
I think.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.400
Bravo!

28:56.317 --> 28:58.194
And knowing that,
I think it's our cue to go.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.362
-I think so.
-Yeah.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.822
I hate this part!

29:01.823 --> 29:02.991
But we are family now.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.913
Now we need to go live
and launch the new property listing.

29:09.539 --> 29:13.251
Step back into a time of tiki bars,
James Bond, and the summer of love

29:13.334 --> 29:17.839
at this perfectly-preserved yet fully
operating mid-century Palm Springs pad.

29:17.922 --> 29:21.509
Live like the '70s whilst enjoying your
contemporary luxury experience

29:21.593 --> 29:23.595
that features a brand new chef's kitchen,

29:23.720 --> 29:27.766
unique decor and private outdoor
entertaining and pool areas.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.894
The Twin Palms time machine, a truly
one-of-a-kind home,

29:30.977 --> 29:33.480
and the ultimate Palm Springs getaway.
