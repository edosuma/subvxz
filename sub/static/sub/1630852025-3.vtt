that the gold is on the metal,

03:42.805 --> 03:45.390
and that there are
just no natural sources,

03:45.475 --> 03:47.300

there is possible tunnels,

05:29.329 --> 05:33.490
Uh, how can I phrase it?
Relatively speaking...

05:33.583 --> 05:35.167

treasure on Oak Island

10:24.540 --> 10:26.041
created a rose color.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.867
- Yeah.
- We know it as rose gold now.

10:27.951 --> 10:30.211
What about the silver, Christa?

10:30.296 --> 10:32.205
Would rose gold
have silver in it?

10:32.289 --> 10:34.633
Yes. Many rose golds
have all of these elements,

10:34.717 --> 10:36.468
including the zinc.

<i>NARRATOR: Although the copper-gold
alloy mixture known as rose gold</i>

10:40.890 --> 10:43.716
<i>became a popular method
for jewelry making</i>

10:43.809 --> 10:47.470
<i>in the early 19th century,

10:47.554 --> 10:49.806

10:58.824 --> 11:01.493
I am encouraged that
the metal is very old.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.152
It's still in an area
of the Money Pit

11:03.237 --> 11:05.413
that there shouldn't have
been anybody down there.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.825
Pre-1840, we don't know
of anybody

11:08.909 --> 11:11.327
- that was tunneling up there, right?
- No.

11:11.412 --> 11:13.838
Nope, that's why I'm
encouraged by the results.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.500
If this is an ancient tunnel,
then where does it lead?

11:17.584 --> 11:20.837
And so, why would
this metal be down there?

11:20.921 --> 11:22.847
There may be some connections
you can draw.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.090
Well, thank you both.

11:24.174 --> 11:25.007
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

11:25.092 --> 11:26.259
Okay. I think it's time

11:26.343 --> 11:27.686
for us to get back there, guys.

11:27.845 --> 11:29.437

Forty-nine.

<i>in the southeastern corner

12:00.386 --> 12:04.297
It is kind of amazing how the

to extend, let's say,</i>

12:07.801 --> 12:10.887

12:21.240 --> 12:24.659
This is a type of road
that was built in Europe

12:24.818 --> 12:28.738
- in the 1500s.
- Wow.

12:28.822 --> 12:31.574
<i>NARRATOR: Last week,
following Terry's presentation,</i>

12:31.658 --> 12:34.419
<i>the team found not
only pieces of</i>

12:34.503 --> 12:36.588

<i>Billy's gonna come
in with the excavator.</i>

12:49.092 --> 12:52.020
<i>Basically, we're unzippering
the land.</i>

12:52.104 --> 12:54.347
We're gonna peel it back,
open it up.

12:54.431 --> 12:56.098
Gary will come in
and metal-detect.

12:56.183 --> 12:57.108
Hopefully find some items.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.781
(device beeping)

13:05.201 --> 13:07.443
Yeah, that's nice.

13:07.528 --> 13:08.861
Hey, Gary.

13:08.946 --> 13:11.206
- Hi, Miriam.
- What you got?

13:11.290 --> 13:14.200
We've got some big shards
of pottery here.

13:14.284 --> 13:17.045
And they're all in this area,

13:17.129 --> 13:18.379
- so I didn't want to disturb them too much.
- Perfect.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.590
There's a piece there.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.470
Ooh, and an old bit
of black glass.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.388
It's super bubbly.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.965
So when you find the bubbles,
it means it's older

13:29.049 --> 13:33.135
because the process of
making it was not as refined.

13:33.220 --> 13:37.232
<i>Could archaeologist
Miriam Amirault be correct?</i>

13:37.391 --> 13:41.310
<i>Is this piece of black glass,
found near the stone road,</i>

13:41.395 --> 13:43.813
<i>part of an ancient container?</i>

13:43.897 --> 13:46.816
<i>And if so, will it be
an important clue</i>

13:46.900 --> 13:49.828
<i>to help verify
when the road was constructed?</i>

13:51.405 --> 13:53.081
- Ooh!
- Yep.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.165
GARY:
We've hit the mother lode here!

13:55.501 --> 13:58.244
This will be fun
piecing it together.

13:58.328 --> 14:01.998
Yeah, 1700s written all over it.

14:02.082 --> 14:06.094
You'd have to find
the neck and the rim.

14:06.253 --> 14:07.595
MIRIAM:
Oh, my goodness.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.099
We have not found
this many pieces of,

14:11.183 --> 14:14.769
like, one single artifact
in all of the swamp.

14:14.928 --> 14:16.354
So this is really cool.

14:16.438 --> 14:19.015
- Gorgeous, isn't it?
- That's nice.

14:19.099 --> 14:22.935
This could easily be
an English wine bottle.

14:23.020 --> 14:25.864
We want the finish, the top,

14:25.948 --> 14:28.858
to be definitive about it.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.444
- I mean, it might be here.
- Yep.

14:31.528 --> 14:35.290
- Oh, my gosh.
- What do you have? - Nice!

14:35.374 --> 14:37.500
Is this exactly
what we were looking for?

14:39.870 --> 14:41.212
Yep.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.882
It's a nice finish.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.134
And that's...

14:46.218 --> 14:49.387
1770s, 1780s, I'd say.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.298
Wow. That is so cool.

14:52.382 --> 14:56.802
<i>NARRATOR: An English wine

14:56.896 --> 14:59.639
<i>three decades before
the discovery of the Money Pit?</i>

14:59.723 --> 15:03.309

15:14.914 --> 15:19.659
- So I guess this is a good area.
- Yep, top-pocket find.

15:19.743 --> 15:21.077
The more interesting
observation:

15:21.161 --> 15:23.663
look at all these cobbles.

15:23.747 --> 15:27.083
That's stacked rock.
It's about two feet,

15:27.167 --> 15:29.427
maybe two and a half
or three feet tall.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.845
It's very consistent.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.339
That's-that's the aha
right there.

15:33.423 --> 15:35.600
- That's something.
- Yeah.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.678
It's hard to say that that is
not a human intervention.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.104
That's built.

15:40.263 --> 15:42.014
It looks like it's--
The edge of the swamp

15:42.099 --> 15:43.432
was planned, to me,
when I look at this.

15:43.517 --> 15:45.768
But then we got the question:
is this stuff

15:45.852 --> 15:50.365
from this new stone feature
or the stone road?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.367
What's it doing this deep,
down here?

15:52.451 --> 15:53.868
- It's deep, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

15:54.027 --> 15:55.703
That's a good question.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.373
<i>NARRATOR:
Another stone structure</i>

15:58.457 --> 16:01.367
<i>at the southeastern
edge of the swamp?</i>

16:01.460 --> 16:04.629
<i>Could it be connected
to the nearby stone wharf,</i>

16:04.713 --> 16:08.457
<i>or is it a completely
different man-made formation?</i>

16:08.542 --> 16:13.388
<i>If so, who built it?
And what was its purpose?</i>

16:13.472 --> 16:15.131
<i>I'm not really sure
what direction</i>

16:15.215 --> 16:16.224
<i>it's going at this point.</i>

16:16.308 --> 16:18.977
- This is so weird.
- It's fantastic.

16:19.136 --> 16:22.397
I think we need to
try to find the boundary.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.232
<i>There may be a path</i>

16:24.316 --> 16:26.985
that leads south and east
from the stone road.

- Hey, Miriam.
- Hi.

16:29.980 --> 16:32.648
<i>RICK: And so, I think we need
to have Steve Guptill come out,</i>

16:32.733 --> 16:36.485
<i>accurately pin the stones, take

16:36.570 --> 16:38.913
Really, I just want
to just survey the update of

16:58.925 --> 17:02.020
<i>but also the purpose
of its construction.</i>

17:02.179 --> 17:04.605
That right there,
I can tell, does tie.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.441
Elevation-wise
and alignment-wise,

17:06.525 --> 17:08.934
- it works with the cobble path.
- Yeah.

17:09.019 --> 17:10.603
Potentially, if it is man-made

17:10.687 --> 17:12.113
and part of some type of path,

17:12.197 --> 17:13.781
it could be an outlet
that heads--

17:13.940 --> 17:15.116
Well, I mean, that's east,

17:15.200 --> 17:16.367
and that's actually towards
the Money Pit.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.704
So, if this is man-made,

17:19.788 --> 17:21.039
this potentially could be
very important.

17:23.042 --> 17:27.286
- Let me survey, and I'm going to put it on a plan when I'm done.
- Okay. Sure.

17:27.370 --> 17:29.622
<i>RICK: It's possible that
this could be part of the path</i>

17:29.706 --> 17:31.632

- Right here?
- Yep.

<i>RICK: I mean, it is
an interesting feature.</i>

17:35.387 --> 17:38.389
- Okay?
- And then kind of like right where I am.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.051
<i>RICK: To me, it speaks
to the original paved area.</i>

17:42.135 --> 17:45.137
It does look like that.
It's very well defined.

17:45.222 --> 17:47.482
I'm gonna put this on a plan.

17:47.641 --> 17:49.484
And I'll bring it back so you
can at least take a look at it

17:49.568 --> 17:50.810
- and compare it.
- Yeah.

17:50.894 --> 17:53.154
Yeah, I would project
the stone path line

17:53.238 --> 17:55.564
to see how it interacts
with this.

17:55.657 --> 17:59.660
- Okay.
- And then, just for grins,

17:59.745 --> 18:03.247
- pretend that's a boundary, pretend this is a boundary.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

18:03.332 --> 18:07.409
-Project this line. See where it goes.
-Sure. Yeah.

18:07.494 --> 18:08.753
Just see where it goes.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.329
All right, so I'll see you guys
in a bit.

18:10.413 --> 18:12.423

18:46.125 --> 18:48.450
I met with Dr. Christa Brosseau.

18:48.535 --> 18:51.704
I took a sample from D-2.

18:51.788 --> 18:53.455
- You know, the piece of metal.
- Oh, yeah.

18:53.540 --> 18:56.125
We put it under the electron
microscope and--

18:56.218 --> 18:57.960
By the way, it was
also non-manganese iron.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.971
So it's old iron,
which is also good.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.630
They said, well, let's look
for some bright spots,

19:01.723 --> 19:03.716
- like maybe inclusions.
- Mm-hmm.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.476
Bingo, it's gold.

19:06.970 --> 19:10.064
This is real data.
This is the stuff I like.

19:10.223 --> 19:11.566
And then Dr. Brosseau says,

19:11.650 --> 19:13.809
"Well, if you zoom in
here further

19:13.894 --> 19:15.486
"and do the composition
of the gold,

19:15.645 --> 19:20.408
65% gold, 26% copper,

19:20.492 --> 19:23.911
And she says,
"I think that's rose gold."

19:23.996 --> 19:26.906
But if you look up rose gold,

19:26.990 --> 19:30.993
75% gold, 22 and a half
percent copper,

19:31.086 --> 19:34.172
and two and a half
percent silver.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.415

are wildly different numbers.

Yeah.

theories about the legendary</i>

20:22.462 --> 20:25.881
<i>Oak Island treasure is that
it could be comprised of gold,</i>

20:25.966 --> 20:29.393
<i>silver and jewels that had been
plundered from the New World</i>

20:29.478 --> 20:32.146
<i>between the 16th
and 18th centuries</i>

20:32.305 --> 20:34.398
<i>by Spanish conquistadors.</i>

20:36.059 --> 20:38.653
<i>The Laginas and their
late partner, Dan Blankenship,</i>

20:38.737 --> 20:40.738
<i>have found numerous
Spanish artifacts</i>

20:40.897 --> 20:43.899
<i>across the island
that support this theory,</i>

20:43.984 --> 20:46.235
<i>including ship spikes,</i>

20:46.319 --> 20:48.412
<i>a pair of 17th century scissors,</i>

20:48.571 --> 20:51.499
<i>and even an eight-cob
maravedi coin</i>

20:51.658 --> 20:54.001
<i>dated to 1652.</i>

20:54.086 --> 20:57.913
- Wow.
<i>- However, in 2015,</i>

20:57.998 --> 21:00.332
<i>descendants of Daniel McGinnis,</i>

21:00.417 --> 21:01.917
<i>one of the three young men</i>

21:02.002 --> 21:04.929
<i>who discovered the Money Pit
in 1795,</i>

21:05.088 --> 21:07.756
<i>presented the team
with a gold cross.</i>

21:07.841 --> 21:10.434
<i>A gold cross that McGinnis
reportedly discovered</i>

21:10.593 --> 21:14.188
<i>30 feet deep in
the original treasure shaft.</i>

21:14.347 --> 21:15.940
- We all want answers.
- Okay.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.599
And we're hoping that you can
weigh in on this

21:17.693 --> 21:19.610
- and enlighten us.
- Well, let's see.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.947
<i>NARRATOR: The following year,
the team had the cross examined</i>

21:23.031 --> 21:26.108
<i>by antiquities expert
Dr. Lori Verderame,</i>

21:26.201 --> 21:27.785
<i>and were stunned
by her assessment.</i>

21:27.944 --> 21:30.204
What you have here
is a Christian cross.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.282
In many ways,
it's very Spanish colonial.

21:33.375 --> 21:37.712
The piece dates
between 1550 and 1700.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.540
<i>NARRATOR: Is it possible
that Rick, Marty and the team</i>

21:41.633 --> 21:43.709
<i>have now also recovered
another piece</i>

21:43.802 --> 21:47.796
<i>of Spanish treasure on
Oak Island in Borehole D-2?</i>

21:47.881 --> 21:50.799
<i>And if so, could that mean
that they have finally</i>

21:50.884 --> 21:53.052
<i>located the original Money Pit?</i>

21:53.145 --> 21:57.898
So, we have an odd gold
that happens to fit a narrative

21:57.983 --> 22:00.735
of ancient Spanish gold.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.822
Well, imagine if it was
the same composition.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.900
- Yeah, we'd start to get pretty excited, yeah.
- Yeah.

22:07.984 --> 22:12.330
Corroborative evidence is always
the best measure of whether

22:12.489 --> 22:15.416
or not something is "real,"
quote, unquote.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.576
Great news.
Great science.

22:17.660 --> 22:21.497
But I think one thing
has come of this.

22:21.581 --> 22:22.840
I think, if we were to ask
each other

22:22.924 --> 22:24.416
where are you going to put

22:24.509 --> 22:26.260
at least one of the caissons,
we have a location.

22:26.419 --> 22:27.920
- Yep.
- Yeah.

22:28.004 --> 22:30.348
I think you pretty much have
to put a caisson down there.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.099
We just made our caisson
meeting a little shorter.

22:32.258 --> 22:34.101
- (laughter)
- Well, okay.

22:34.260 --> 22:35.102
- That's great.
- Yep.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.856
Gold in the Money Pit!

22:41.443 --> 22:43.936
<i>NARRATOR:
The following morning...</i>

22:44.029 --> 22:46.864
<i>in the southeast corner
of the Oak Island swamp...</i>

22:47.023 --> 22:47.940
Liz?

22:48.033 --> 22:49.617
- Yeah.
- Give me a hand.

22:49.701 --> 22:53.779
<i>archaeologists Laird Niven,
Miriam Amirault,</i>

22:53.863 --> 22:57.449
<i>and Liz Michels continue
investigating the mysterious</i>

22:57.542 --> 23:01.462
<i>stone feature that was
discovered just one day ago.</i>

23:01.546 --> 23:05.707
- What you got?
- I have a piece of pottery,

23:05.801 --> 23:08.219
but I think it's really
delicate.

23:08.303 --> 23:10.471
So can you make me

23:10.555 --> 23:12.890
a little aluminum foil pouch?

23:13.049 --> 23:14.809
Sure.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.395
I'm just trying to get under it.

23:17.554 --> 23:19.563
- It's pretty deep.
- That's all right, though.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.473
That means it's probably still
in its original context, right?

23:21.566 --> 23:22.483
Exactly. Yeah.

23:24.486 --> 23:28.531
This is where we
find out it's a rock.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.327
You can see it's
definitely pottery, right?

23:33.412 --> 23:34.912
- Yeah.
- But it's really...

23:34.996 --> 23:37.581
- Really degraded.
- really delicate.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.492
- You can see the grit, though.
- Mm-hmm.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.829
Um, and it may have some sort
of decoration on the inside.

23:43.913 --> 23:46.081
You can see it there, but...

23:46.174 --> 23:48.250
I think that has
to go back to the lab.

23:48.343 --> 23:51.095
- Yep.
- Cause it's definitely Mi'kmaq.

23:51.254 --> 23:54.923
This one's the most delicate
I've ever seen.

23:55.016 --> 23:59.687
<i>NARRATOR: Mi'kmaq pottery
discovered along the new stone feature?</i>

23:59.846 --> 24:03.023
<i>As inhabitants of the lands
known today as Nova Scotia,</i>

24:03.183 --> 24:05.267
<i>archaeological evidence suggests</i>

24:05.360 --> 24:07.862
<i>that the indigenous
Mi'kmaq people</i>

24:07.946 --> 24:11.449
<i>have been settled in this
region for at least 4,000 years.</i>

24:11.608 --> 24:14.869
<i>Although much of their history
is uncertain,</i>

24:14.953 --> 24:18.030
<i>it is widely documented
that the Mi'kmaq began trading</i>

24:18.123 --> 24:22.209
<i>with European explorers as early
as the late 15th century.</i>

24:22.294 --> 24:27.214
You can see the striations
here, the lines.

24:27.299 --> 24:31.218
We used to call this era
the ceramic period, right?

24:31.377 --> 24:33.721
For the Mi'kmaq. But now
it's called the woodland period.

24:33.880 --> 24:37.382
So this could be 500 years old.

24:37.467 --> 24:39.551
It could be 2,500 years old.

24:39.636 --> 24:42.480
It really depends on what's
revealed on the other side.

24:45.058 --> 24:47.735
<i>I've been expecting, ever
since I've been on Oak Island,</i>

24:47.819 --> 24:50.321
<i>that we would find some
evidence of the Mi'kmaq here.</i>

24:50.480 --> 24:52.156
<i>This evidence
that we're finding right now,</i>

24:52.315 --> 24:55.159
although it's really,
really early days,

24:55.318 --> 24:57.736
<i>and very little area
has been opened,</i>

24:57.829 --> 25:00.739
<i>we need to communicate that
because of</i>

25:00.823 --> 25:03.083
<i>the terms of the permit.</i>

25:03.168 --> 25:05.586
And consider the whole edge
of the swamp,

25:05.670 --> 25:06.995
the eastern edge of the swamp,

25:07.080 --> 25:08.589
<i>as having high potential</i>

25:08.748 --> 25:10.257
<i>for containing more artifacts.</i>

25:12.677 --> 25:15.679
I'm gonna take the ceramic
back to the archaeology trailer

25:15.764 --> 25:17.765
- and let Rick know.
- Okay. All right.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.934
Can you hold the fort?

25:20.093 --> 25:22.937
- Absolutely.
- All right.

25:23.096 --> 25:24.104
See you in a bit.

25:24.264 --> 25:28.183
<i>- Hey, guys.
- Hey!</i>

25:28.276 --> 25:29.434
<i>- Hey, guys.
- Hey!</i>

25:29.528 --> 25:31.353
<i>What's up today?</i>

25:31.437 --> 25:34.773
So, Laird is here with me,
and he has an update

25:34.857 --> 25:38.702
- regarding the work in the southeast corner of the swamp.
<i>- Okay.</i>

25:38.787 --> 25:42.114
<i>NARRATOR: In the war room,
archaeologist Laird Niven</i>

25:42.198 --> 25:44.032
<i>has called a meeting
with the Laginas</i>

25:44.125 --> 25:46.034
<i>and their partner Craig Tester</i>

25:46.119 --> 25:49.213
<i>to discuss the possible
indigenous pottery</i>

25:49.297 --> 25:51.957
<i>that was discovered near
the mysterious stone feature</i>

25:52.050 --> 25:54.543
<i>in the southeast corner
of the swamp.</i>

25:54.627 --> 25:57.721
One of the things that
is significantly different

25:57.806 --> 25:59.131
this year than last is

25:59.224 --> 26:01.383
<i>the new regulations that
have come down from</i>

26:01.467 --> 26:03.468
<i>Communities, Culture
and Heritage.</i>

26:03.562 --> 26:06.230
<i>Laird made a significant find
of pottery</i>

26:06.389 --> 26:08.223
<i>in the southeast corner
of the swamp.</i>

26:08.308 --> 26:11.151
<i>So Laird is going
to bring us up to speed</i>

26:11.311 --> 26:15.063
in terms of what it may mean
for future investigation.

26:15.148 --> 26:18.492
So, Laird, I'm going to toss it
to you and you can fill them in.

26:18.577 --> 26:22.487
Well, we're finding
Mi'kmaq artifacts,

26:22.581 --> 26:26.408
First Nations artifacts,
in the southeast corner.

26:26.492 --> 26:27.993
Like what items?
What are you finding?

26:28.086 --> 26:29.420
Pottery.

26:29.504 --> 26:30.495
Some Mi'kmaq pottery.

26:30.580 --> 26:31.505
<i>- Oh, really?</i>
- Yeah.

26:31.664 --> 26:33.507
But we did have a visit

26:33.592 --> 26:35.259
from Community,
Culture and Heritage.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.177
- I think it was a very productive visit.
- A positive one.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.005
And they were thrilled
with the find.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.016
And to me it showed
that we're doing our job.

26:42.175 --> 26:43.342
Because it was so careful,

26:43.435 --> 26:46.678
we were able to basically
not disturb anything.

26:46.763 --> 26:49.690
So they were thrilled with that.

26:49.849 --> 26:52.684
But one thing they need to do is
get a hold of Acadia First Nation

26:52.769 --> 26:54.361
and see if they're interested

26:54.446 --> 26:58.774
in coming to the island
for a site visit.

26:58.858 --> 27:00.451
<i>CRAIG:
I think that's a great idea.</i>

27:00.610 --> 27:02.453
Let's do it. I don't have
a problem with that.

27:02.537 --> 27:04.946
But Laird has brought up
a concern,

27:05.031 --> 27:06.874
- and I think it needs to be addressed.
- Okay.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.043
LAIRD: Because of
the Mi'kmaq artifacts,

27:09.127 --> 27:10.369
Community, Culture and Heritage

27:10.462 --> 27:11.629
may require us

27:11.788 --> 27:14.048
- to stop work in that area.
- Okay.

27:16.959 --> 27:18.543
<i>NARRATOR:
Although finding artifacts</i>

27:18.637 --> 27:20.629
<i>that may date back
more than 20 centuries</i>

27:20.722 --> 27:23.057
<i>on Oak Island is exciting,</i>

27:23.216 --> 27:27.469
<i>their potential connection to
the Mi'kmaq people could result</i>

27:27.562 --> 27:30.972
<i>in the provincial Department of
Community, Culture and Heritage</i>

27:31.057 --> 27:33.984
<i>and the Acadia
First Nation Mi'kmaq Council</i>

27:34.069 --> 27:37.229
<i>declaring the eastern portion
of the swamp off-limits</i>

27:37.313 --> 27:39.490
<i>for further search activity.</i>

27:39.574 --> 27:42.493
We're trying to find a way
to work within the constraints

27:42.577 --> 27:46.071
- of CCH...
- Mm-hmm.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.498
To find a way to move forward
on all fronts.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.908
We've been doing
everything right.

27:50.001 --> 27:54.004
I'm hopeful that all sides
will enter into a very fruitful

27:54.089 --> 27:57.332
and honest discussion
about how we can mitigate.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.500
<i>MARTY:
Yeah, I agree.</i>

27:58.593 --> 28:00.168
<i>Are we going to cooperate?</i>

28:00.253 --> 28:02.429
<i>Hell yes. Are we going
to do it right? Yes.</i>

28:02.514 --> 28:04.256
<i>Are we going to follow
the rules? Yes.</i>

28:04.349 --> 28:07.008
Because we have found
First Nation artifacts

28:07.093 --> 28:09.103
here on Oak Island,
we have a duty to notify

28:09.262 --> 28:12.097
both CCH and First Nation.

28:12.181 --> 28:15.609
<i>Am I worried about what they
might say or do or require?</i>

28:15.694 --> 28:17.695
<i>Yeah, I'm concerned,
because, look,</i>

28:17.854 --> 28:20.021
<i>it's yet another level
of supervision.</i>

28:20.106 --> 28:21.949
<i>But does that dissuade me
from doing it?</i>

28:22.033 --> 28:24.276
<i>No, it's the right thing to do.</i>

28:24.360 --> 28:26.528
They have certain rights
under Nova Scotia law.

28:26.612 --> 28:28.038
We're gonna abide by that.

28:28.197 --> 28:30.290
RICK:
The overarching realization

28:30.375 --> 28:33.377
has to be that,
without the mystery,

28:33.461 --> 28:36.538
nothing else goes on.

28:36.622 --> 28:38.882
Without you trying to solve
the mystery,

28:38.967 --> 28:41.042
nothing else goes on.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.712
<i>RICK:
CCH is well-intentioned,</i>

28:43.796 --> 28:47.641
but they have said--
And I hope we hold them to it--

28:47.800 --> 28:50.051
That they will work with us.

28:50.136 --> 28:53.638
<i>Well, you know, look,
appreciate the update.</i>

28:53.723 --> 28:55.899
<i>I guess Laird will do his thing
over there in the southeast</i>

28:55.984 --> 28:57.818
<i>until he's satisfied</i>

28:57.977 --> 29:01.646
and CCH is satisfied, and
we'll... we'll go dig elsewhere.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.907
-Oh, yeah.
-I agree. We have to take advantage

29:04.066 --> 29:05.901
of what we can do
in the near term.

29:05.985 --> 29:08.245
<i>Okay, well, carry on.</i>

29:08.404 --> 29:10.831
- All right.
- Okey doke. Hopefully we'll have

29:10.915 --> 29:12.833
another update for you
that's a bit more positive.

29:12.992 --> 29:14.418
(Rick chuckles)

29:14.502 --> 29:15.919
<i>Okay, Rick. Thanks.</i>

29:16.004 --> 29:17.913
<i>- RICK: See you, guys.
- MARTY: Yeah. Bye-bye.</i>

29:17.997 --> 29:21.249
<i>NARRATOR:

When you projected
the two things that I asked you

29:36.024 --> 29:38.275
- to project, was there any aha moments?
- Yeah. Yeah, actually.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.444
We'll talk about that.

<i>NARRATOR:
Rick Lagina and Laird Niven</i>

corner of the swamp</i>

29:45.107 --> 29:47.284
<i>with other members of the team.</i>

29:47.443 --> 29:50.028
I don't have an opinion.
I have facts.

29:50.112 --> 29:51.696
<i>NARRATOR: They have
gathered to receive a report</i>

29:51.781 --> 29:53.540
<i>from surveyor Steve Guptill</i>

29:53.699 --> 29:56.960
<i>regarding the stone feature
discovered one day ago</i>

29:57.119 --> 29:59.871
<i>and the direction
it may be heading.</i>

29:59.956 --> 30:02.958
Here is an overview of the area.

30:03.042 --> 30:04.218
And here is a projection
of the current path

30:04.377 --> 30:06.553
we're standing on.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.463
So this is the cobble path
from last year.

30:08.548 --> 30:10.382
It hits the cobble
that we found this year,

30:10.466 --> 30:11.725
which is what we're standing on.

30:11.884 --> 30:13.227
The elevation is very close.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.896
Now, that is
one foot, eight inches.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.315
Where it joins here,
this is it here.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.983
This is a larger overview.

30:20.142 --> 30:22.143
Rick asked me
to project the line

30:22.237 --> 30:24.062
on the north and south side.

30:24.155 --> 30:28.659
I projected this cobble path
across the lots.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.986
And so, when you project this
path, it heads to the Money Pit.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.330
- This path?
- This path here.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.493
Look right here.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.245
There's the Money Pit grid.

30:40.329 --> 30:41.746
- Yep.
- C-1 is right there.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.341
It projects just north
of C-1 a couple feet.

30:44.425 --> 30:45.926
That's interesting.

30:46.085 --> 30:48.253
IAN:
It makes some sense,

30:48.346 --> 30:50.180
because we're going
into the upland here.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.765
- Yeah.
- This is it.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.258
This is what
we've been looking for.

30:53.342 --> 30:55.686
Right.

30:55.845 --> 30:59.606
<i>NARRATOR: Has the team now
unearthed a previously hidden section</i>

30:59.765 --> 31:01.516

31:01.601 --> 31:04.102
<i>One that leads directly
from the stone wharf</i>

31:04.195 --> 31:07.364
<i>to the C-1 cluster

31:07.448 --> 31:10.025

31:10.109 --> 31:13.028
<i>of silver and gold
deep below ground,</i>

31:13.112 --> 31:15.372
<i>but also where they
are currently drilling</i>

31:15.531 --> 31:18.208
<i>in search
of the legendary treasure vault?</i>

31:18.293 --> 31:23.463
<i>If so, what other valuable clues
might they discover here?</i>

31:23.548 --> 31:25.540
<i>RICK: I don't know that
any of us were expecting</i>

31:25.633 --> 31:27.459
<i>what we'll call
the "stone path."</i>

31:27.543 --> 31:30.804
<i>But let's expand the search area</i>

31:30.963 --> 31:33.724
and try to find out, you know,
additional information.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.383
IAN: I think something really
important's being found here.

31:35.468 --> 31:37.552
They were going this way.

31:37.645 --> 31:40.472
- And why go this way if you're a fisherman or a farmer?
- RICK: Right.

31:40.556 --> 31:44.067
- Okay. Well, let's try to understand this feature.
- Absolutely.

31:48.397 --> 31:50.982

32:22.598 --> 32:26.360
<i>at a depth

32:26.519 --> 32:30.105
- 89.
- 89. Thank you.

32:30.189 --> 32:32.866
83 to 89.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.284
Here in front of us.
What do we got?

32:34.443 --> 32:36.703
STEVE G.:
Anything going on down there?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.863
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

32:38.948 --> 32:41.458
CRAIG: Yeah. A little bit
of wood at the very bottom.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.044
(chuckles):
Look at that. Wow.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.546
<i>NARRATOR:
Wood? Found at a depth</i>

32:46.631 --> 32:50.291
<i>of nearly 90 feet
in Borehole B-4?</i>

32:50.376 --> 32:52.794
-TERRY: Okay, We got disturbed
material, -Right on the edge there.

32:52.878 --> 32:55.973
- Yeah.
- We're close to our tunnel horizon.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.808
We hit it 88 to 92.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.968
So we're
right in the sweet spot here.

33:00.052 --> 33:02.229
Looks like we got something
very interesting.

33:02.313 --> 33:06.141
<i>NARRATOR: Although they were
hoping to reach a structure much deeper,</i>

33:06.225 --> 33:09.310

<i>one week ago, the team
obtained not only wood,</i>

33:12.648 --> 33:17.318
<i>but also the gold object
from Borehole D-2.</i>

33:17.403 --> 33:21.573
<i>Is it possible that they've just
encountered the same structure?</i>

33:21.666 --> 33:23.491
<i>And, if so,</i>

33:23.576 --> 33:25.669
<i>could it also be connected
to the evidence</i>

33:25.828 --> 33:28.413
<i>of a massive source
of gold and silver</i>

33:28.506 --> 33:31.591
<i>recently detected

33:31.676 --> 33:35.262
We have somebody shaping wood
to make a tunnel or a shaft.

33:35.346 --> 33:38.673
The next drill intersection
will tell the tale, hopefully.

33:38.758 --> 33:40.267
The core drill is
coming out of the ground now.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.102
- CHARLES: Here we go.
- Here we go.

33:42.261 --> 33:44.679
<i>RICK: Every time the drill goes
down now versus other years,</i>

33:44.764 --> 33:46.356
<i>the hope is to slice open</i>

33:46.441 --> 33:49.609
the plastic, and voilà,
there's gold, there's silver.

33:49.694 --> 33:52.353
Part of a chest.
Part of something.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.439
A definite.
Maybe even the one,

33:54.523 --> 33:57.692
my long sought after,
elusive one thing.

33:57.777 --> 33:59.119
<i>There is something down there.</i>

33:59.203 --> 34:01.863
Core intersection,

34:01.956 --> 34:03.373
- we'll see what it tells us.
- 93.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.043
- 93?
- Thank you.

34:08.954 --> 34:10.714
All right.

34:12.041 --> 34:15.210
- Oh! I can see goodness.
- Yep.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.378
- You see something?
- I can see

34:17.463 --> 34:20.223
definitely something of interest
right about there.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.467
- Okay, whoa, look at that, gentlemen.
- There we go.

34:22.551 --> 34:23.968
That looks like we went right
through the floor of a tunnel.

34:24.053 --> 34:26.721
That is definitely sawn wood,

34:26.806 --> 34:30.975
and it looks like
a relatively irregular handsaw.

34:31.060 --> 34:33.311
Craig, what do you think?

34:33.395 --> 34:35.405
Yeah, I'm with you.

34:35.490 --> 34:38.399
This part, the blades are coming
at a little different angle.

34:38.484 --> 34:40.902
Yeah. That says
somebody's heaving and pulling.

34:40.986 --> 34:42.487
Yep.

34:42.571 --> 34:44.414
STEVE G.:
So, based on what we see,

34:44.573 --> 34:47.250
would you call this a shaft
or a tunnel?

34:47.335 --> 34:50.754
That could well be
the floor planks

34:50.838 --> 34:52.923
of a tunnel, definitely.

34:53.007 --> 34:56.176
TERRY: We've got a
very, very interesting area

34:56.260 --> 34:58.336
in and around C-1.

34:58.429 --> 35:01.431
STEVE G.: It almost
seems like we can't miss.

35:04.844 --> 35:07.687
<i>NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon,</i>

35:07.772 --> 35:09.848
<i>after being alerted
by Laird Niven</i>

35:09.932 --> 35:11.525
<i>of an update from the Department</i>

<i>of Community,

- Hey, Rick.

35:15.354 --> 35:18.115
<i>Rick Lagina has called
an emergency meeting</i>

35:18.199 --> 35:21.025
<i>with his brother Marty,

35:21.110 --> 35:24.445
<i>and members of the team

35:24.530 --> 35:26.623
RICK:
We have everybody here

35:26.707 --> 35:29.042
that could come out of the field
in the war room right now.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.202
And you know what the discussion
is related to:

35:31.287 --> 35:33.454
the archaeological work

35:33.539 --> 35:36.716
and the fallout, if you will,
from notifying

35:36.876 --> 35:38.552
the Acadia First Nations.

35:38.636 --> 35:41.972
And I wanted everyone
to understand

35:42.056 --> 35:43.882
the current situation.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.892
So, Laird, if you want
to bring everyone up to speed.

35:45.977 --> 35:49.053
Well, basically,
Acadia First Nation

35:49.138 --> 35:51.481
got hold of Community,
Culture and Heritage.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.900
<i>MARTY:
Okay.</i>

35:53.985 --> 35:55.977
And before you go
any further, Laird,

35:56.061 --> 35:58.488
<i>it's the pottery
that's causing the concern?</i>

35:58.573 --> 36:00.732
Presumably so, yeah.

36:00.816 --> 36:02.817
The pottery we found

36:02.902 --> 36:05.579
mean that they were there
for some period of time.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.822
How long they were there,
we don't know.

36:07.907 --> 36:10.584
They have requested maps
and all the information

36:10.668 --> 36:13.244
and all the data
as regards the finds,

36:13.329 --> 36:16.080
the locations, the depths,
the elevations.

36:16.165 --> 36:18.758
Steve is working on that,
and I have some suspicion

36:18.843 --> 36:21.502
and belief that
they won't respond

36:21.596 --> 36:23.513
until that information is
in hand.

36:23.672 --> 36:24.923
Yeah.

36:25.007 --> 36:27.267
And the archaeologists asked

36:27.351 --> 36:28.810
that we stop down.

36:30.846 --> 36:35.108
Stop work at the area where
we're finding the artifacts.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.694
It's just a blanket prohibition,

36:37.778 --> 36:40.030
because they
haven't been here yet.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.699
I see.

36:42.858 --> 36:45.368
I.e. "you must cease."
And those were...

36:45.453 --> 36:46.870
that was the verbiage:
"you must cease

36:46.954 --> 36:49.197
and desist immediately."

36:49.281 --> 36:51.041
Well...

36:59.884 --> 37:02.052
Honestly, I'm becoming

37:02.136 --> 37:02.961
increasingly more frustrated
with this whole thing.

37:03.045 --> 37:04.387
<i>NARRATOR:

37:04.472 --> 37:07.807
<i>Rick Lagina

37:07.892 --> 37:10.310
<i>have just informed

37:10.469 --> 37:12.553
<i>the provincial Department of
Community, Culture and Heritage</i>

37:12.638 --> 37:15.065
<i>are restricting search activity</i>

<i>indigenous Mi'kmaq artifacts

37:22.240 --> 37:24.565
RICK: I think
what we're trying to do

37:24.650 --> 37:28.236
is understand exactly
what the prohibitions are.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.579
- Correct?
- Yeah.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.322
STEVE G.:
Let me show you some areas.

37:31.407 --> 37:33.416
I'll share my screen, Marty.

37:35.160 --> 37:38.746
<i>MARTY: What is the big green and
big red polygon to the right?</i>

37:38.831 --> 37:41.508
<i>- What are those?</i>
- So, this is for drilling.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.094
<i>We have free range
inside of the green.</i>

37:44.178 --> 37:47.013
Any activity inside the green,
we're allowed to pursue.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.014
I see.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.016
<i>And the red?</i>

37:50.101 --> 37:52.018
Anything that falls
outside of the green,

37:52.103 --> 37:55.772
we need special permission
to be inside of the red.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.435
The problem is,

38:00.519 --> 38:03.021
the area we're digging
seems to indicate

38:03.105 --> 38:06.032
where the stone road and the
associated stone path was going.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.776
Appears to be going
to the upland.

38:08.861 --> 38:11.446
Appears to be going to...
towards the Money Pit.

38:11.530 --> 38:13.707
<i>MARTY:
We need to go dig over there.</i>

38:13.866 --> 38:15.283
<i>Guess what. We can't.</i>

38:15.367 --> 38:17.201
Just look at that map
that's in front of us.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.880
"See this green area?
Okay, guys, that can be yours.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.551
The rest is kind of ours."
Look at the map.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.720
(laughs):
It's... I mean, come on.

38:26.804 --> 38:27.887
<i>BILLY:
I'm with you, Marty.</i>

38:27.972 --> 38:29.639
And I know Oak Island is
a special place.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.049
I get that, right?

38:31.133 --> 38:32.642
But everything
that's been done--

38:32.727 --> 38:34.728
And I'm with Marty on this one--
Everything that's been done

38:34.812 --> 38:37.480
to this point,
there's far more oversight here.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.815
I can go across the island

38:38.899 --> 38:40.558
and dig all the holes
that I want to,

38:40.642 --> 38:41.735
and nobody's gonna stop me.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.486
It seems unfair
and it seems ridiculous.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.739
<i>Billy, that's
completely correct.</i>

38:45.898 --> 38:47.398
I'm not objecting to us

38:47.483 --> 38:48.649
<i>following the rules, okay?</i>

38:48.734 --> 38:50.243
<i>Four acres</i>

38:50.328 --> 38:54.072
are now off-limits to us
on the island we own.

38:54.156 --> 38:55.749
<i>If we find more things</i>

38:55.833 --> 38:59.336
<i>that are extremely important
archaeologically,</i>

38:59.420 --> 39:02.580
<i>we may end up with red circles
all over the island.</i>

39:02.664 --> 39:04.665
In effect,
we're running the risk

39:04.750 --> 39:08.336
of losing our property
by performing properly.

39:08.420 --> 39:10.847
Our ability to work function
on our own island

39:10.931 --> 39:13.758
is getting eroded
in leaps and bounds.

39:13.842 --> 39:16.844
<i>It is very discouraging to me.</i>

39:16.929 --> 39:19.097
<i>And the more we cooperate
and the more we dig,</i>

39:19.181 --> 39:21.682
<i>the more of our island we lose.</i>

39:21.767 --> 39:24.277
I... I'm almost to the point
of saying fine,

39:24.362 --> 39:26.529
let's go in that green box
and let's throw in the towel

39:26.614 --> 39:28.272
everywhere else.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.952
<i>Right now I am so discouraged
that I... I think</i>

39:33.037 --> 39:34.946
I would finish the year
in that green box,

39:35.039 --> 39:37.540
and I'd say, You know what,
we're done. We're done."

39:42.546 --> 39:44.288
<i>I don't know, guys.</i>

39:44.382 --> 39:46.299
<i>I don't know.</i>

39:46.384 --> 39:48.626
The stone road, which is...
could be so significant

39:48.710 --> 39:49.969
to what we're trying to do,

39:50.054 --> 39:52.013
is now in the center
of a red circle.

39:53.215 --> 39:55.216
<i>What do you want to do, Rick?</i>

39:55.300 --> 39:57.135
I hate to lay it on you,
but what do you want to do?

39:57.228 --> 39:59.229
There's a way to move forward,
and I think we should.

40:00.981 --> 40:04.567
I think there are areas
that continue to intrigue us.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.153
The drilling program that
is progressing in the Money Pit

40:07.238 --> 40:10.064
- provides real hope and promise.
- You're right.

40:10.149 --> 40:11.983
This roadblock has been thrown
in front of us.

40:12.067 --> 40:14.160
We're gonna go somewhere else,

40:14.245 --> 40:16.746
and we're gonna find
something spectacular.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.658
RICK:
We'll find a way through this.

40:20.742 --> 40:22.410
There's a lot of work to do

40:22.494 --> 40:24.579
that will help us move
the search agenda forward.

40:24.663 --> 40:28.007
<i>Sempre avanti.</i> Just let's
just keep moving forward.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.418
Okay.

40:30.502 --> 40:32.595
<i>RICK: It's just the
way it's going to be.</i>

40:34.506 --> 40:36.924
<i>NARRATOR: A legendary
treasure has lured virtuous,</i>

40:37.009 --> 40:39.594
<i>determined and skilled people
to Oak Island</i>

40:39.678 --> 40:42.272
<i>for more than two centuries now.</i>

40:42.431 --> 40:45.766
<i>For many,
what began with great hope</i>

40:45.851 --> 40:49.103
<i>for the ultimate discovery
ended in disaster,</i>

40:49.188 --> 40:52.440
<i>caused by forces that were
beyond their control.</i>

40:52.524 --> 40:55.776
<i>Now, as Rick, Marty,
Craig and their team</i>

40:55.861 --> 40:58.037
<i>are perhaps closer
than anyone before them</i>

40:58.197 --> 41:00.123
<i>to solving this mystery,</i>

41:00.207 --> 41:04.535
<i>those same forces are
bearing down on them, as well.</i>

41:04.620 --> 41:06.454
<i>Is the curse of Oak Island</i>

41:06.538 --> 41:08.965
<i>once again asserting its power,</i>

41:09.124 --> 41:11.209
<i>ensuring that the answers
to the mystery</i>

41:11.293 --> 41:13.636
<i>remain just out of reach?</i>

41:13.795 --> 41:17.307
<i>Or can they prove that,
at long last,</i>

41:17.466 --> 41:21.644
<i>the island
has finally met its match?</i>

41:25.891 --> 41:28.392
<i>Next time</i>
<i>on</i> The Curse of Oak Island...

41:28.477 --> 41:30.403
<i>- MARTY: Whoa-ho!
- TERRY: Wow!</i>

41:30.488 --> 41:32.822
If it's a shaft,
it's a very large shaft.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.908
- (beeping)
- What the heck is that?

41:34.992 --> 41:37.235
- To me, it looks like a chisel.
- Wow!

41:37.319 --> 41:38.995
What the hell are these doing
on Oak Island?

41:39.079 --> 41:40.821
The composition of the rocks
are quite unusual.

41:40.906 --> 41:42.240
Whoa! A-U.

41:42.324 --> 41:44.909
- That's gold.
- (chuckles)

41:44.993 --> 41:48.496
<i>CHRISTA: The really interesting
part of this particular object</i>

41:48.580 --> 41:51.007
is that there are
several gold flakes on it.

41:51.166 --> 41:52.342
Wow.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.844
