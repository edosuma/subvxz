WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:05.806
I just think this long-distance
relationship of yours

00:05.839 --> 00:08.008
-is so romantic.
-Oh.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.643
There's a Chinese proverb
that says,

00:09.677 --> 00:11.011
"Fate brings people together

00:11.045 --> 00:13.013
no matter how far apart
they may be."

00:13.047 --> 00:15.816
-Oh, Jen. Oh, that's so sweet.
-Mm.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.918
The Chinese have
such beautiful sayings,

00:17.951 --> 00:19.087
-don't they?
-Oh.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.421
Yeah,
and then some stupid American

00:20.454 --> 00:22.223
will tattoo it on their neck.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.924
(chuckling)

00:23.957 --> 00:25.226
No, Jen's right, Mom.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.994
You have never seemed happier.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.663
Oh, well,
it's all thanks to Edward.

00:29.697 --> 00:30.931
-Ooh. Mwah.
-Oh, come on, come on.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.433
What can I say?

00:32.466 --> 00:34.502
The woman fills the hole
in my heart.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.503
Aw.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.071
Thought that was a stent.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.940
You can fill the hole in my face

00:39.973 --> 00:41.675
with that piece of pie.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.877
No, you know what, Mom?
It just...

00:43.911 --> 00:46.247
It feels like you're
a totally different person.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.582
You know?
I mean, wining, dining,

00:48.616 --> 00:51.619
flying across the country
to see your boyfriend.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.053
You've really blossomed.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.423
Yeah. No, I do.
I feel more independent.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.126
For years, I-I lived
for my husband and my children,

00:58.159 --> 01:01.195
-and now I'm finally living
for myself, you know?
-Yeah.

01:01.229 --> 01:02.396
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, it's a celebration.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.731
Let's have some pie.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.966
Oh.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.868
Bonnie, I'm sorry.
We have to be going, actually.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.270
-Come on.
-Oh, dear.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.539
Yeah, my-my flight
to Connecticut is tomorrow.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.073
-So sorry.
-Oh!
-No, no. Uh...

01:13.107 --> 01:14.875
Well, you know what?
No. No worries, Mom.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.044
You know,
we'll-we'll just have pie

01:17.077 --> 01:19.580
when you come back into town.

01:21.415 --> 01:25.085
Listen, I'm-I'm gonna be
a little late tomorrow morning.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.721
I'm taking Bonnie out
for a farewell brunch.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.090
Well, you've been late seven
days this week. Why stop there?

01:30.124 --> 01:32.593
(chuckles)
Bye. Bye, Mom.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.962
-See you, guys.
-(chuckles)

01:34.995 --> 01:37.097
You know,
I love that I get to say this,

01:37.131 --> 01:39.567
but I'm really gonna miss
my mom when she leaves.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.069
Yeah. I really miss Ed
while she's here.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.972
Oh, stop. Stop.
You know, so what if,

01:45.005 --> 01:46.340
while she's visiting,
he's a little distracted?

01:46.374 --> 01:47.641
-It's sweet.
-He's more than distracted.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.310
He's head over heels over her,

01:49.343 --> 01:51.512
and that's not good for a guy
with an inner ear problem.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.746
All right, well, yeah.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.582
All I know is

01:54.615 --> 01:56.917
I have never seen her happier.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.020
I hope I can find something
like that after you die.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.622
That's sweet.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.191
You should put that
on a Valentine's card.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.359
-(laughs)
-Listen, I just think Ed needs

02:05.393 --> 02:07.027
-a little more balance
with this stuff,
-Ah.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.796
-so I'm gonna give him
a little talk today.
-Oh, no.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.531
-Mi-Michael Baxter,
don't you dare.
-What?

02:10.564 --> 02:12.166
-I'm just gonna talk to him.
Just... I'm just gonna talk...
-No, no.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.368
Do not interfere! This is
not one of those situations

02:14.402 --> 02:15.769
where you get to...

02:15.803 --> 02:17.805
-Play piano?
-No, no, no.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.473
It's-it's what you always do.
The...

02:19.507 --> 02:21.342
-Massage a monkey?
-No.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.776
It's being a puppeteer.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.111
-That's not a puppeteer.
-Yes.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.346
Puppet's like this.
Wooden slats.

02:25.379 --> 02:26.847
Finger, fingers.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.649
Bring in another puppet.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.919
Yeah. I'm the puppet master.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.888
*

02:37.891 --> 02:39.660
CHUCK:
Ed's on his way up.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.462
He's taking a long time,

02:41.495 --> 02:45.333
because he's literally stopping
to smell the roses.

02:45.366 --> 02:49.069
That guy actually makes me want
to hate love.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.138
And people are starting to
complain about all the hugging.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.141
I don't want to say who,
but it's me.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.077
All right. It's becoming
a problem here at work,

02:57.110 --> 02:58.979
-and I will have a talk
with him.
-Mm.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.714
Good, 'cause I'm thinking
about getting him some slippers

03:00.748 --> 03:02.015
so I can hear him coming.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.751
You know, the old man shuffle.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.052
(mimics shuffling sounds)

03:05.085 --> 03:06.587
(Mike chuckles)

03:09.022 --> 03:12.059
That sounds exactly like
my grandpa.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.527
Good memories.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.528
-Bring 'em in.
-Aw.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.029
Hey!

03:16.063 --> 03:18.131
Bring it out, man. Yes.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.069
Mike, there's only one drug
that can make you feel

03:22.102 --> 03:24.004
like you're walking on air
and sunshine.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.107
Yeah. LSD.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.108
No.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.910
L-U-V.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.712
Yeah, about your relationship
with Bonnie--

03:31.745 --> 03:34.014
it's becoming
kind of a burden to others.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.183
I'm creating problems at work.
I'm sorry.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.885
No, no, no, it's okay,
it's okay.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.521
You and Bonnie are doing great,
and I don't want to change that.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.256
-But it's not okay.
-Oh.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.057
You know, when you see someone

03:44.091 --> 03:45.693
once a week every month,
you know,

03:45.726 --> 03:48.195
you want to take advantage
of every second. It's...

03:48.228 --> 03:50.698
-I understand. And, again,
I don't want to change that,
-Yes. Yeah.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.900
but... I want to change that.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.202
I'll talk to Bonnie while
I'm driving her to the airport.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.470
-Hey, you don't have to.
-All right? Yeah. Huh?

03:56.504 --> 03:58.572
-But you have to.
-(stammering)

04:01.174 --> 04:04.978
And with that,
your system is up and running.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.582
The finest in home security that
I had left over in my garage.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.618
(phone chimes)

04:10.651 --> 04:13.120
-Wh-What was that?
-Oh, that's the security app

04:13.153 --> 04:15.323
letting you know
someone's in your apartment.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.758
Hey, it's us.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.093
-Mandy, wave.
-(Chuck laughs)

04:20.127 --> 04:21.429
Oh, no. No, no.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.531
The-the camera's
in the smoke detector.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.335
Hi, Kyle.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.304
Whoa, I can even hear you.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.573
(Chuck laughs)

04:32.606 --> 04:36.410
O-Okay, so, uh, when you want
to set the alarm, all you...

04:36.444 --> 04:38.812
Okay, when you want to turn
the alarm on...

04:38.846 --> 04:40.314
When you... Guys, look at me!

04:42.182 --> 04:43.951
When you want to set the alarm,

04:43.984 --> 04:45.819
all you have to do
is push "command, 3."

04:45.853 --> 04:47.287
-Okay?
-All right. Got it.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.156
-Hey, thanks, Mr. Larabee.
-Uh, you're welcome.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.157
-We really appreciate it.
-Yeah.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.692
Don't we, honey?

04:51.725 --> 04:54.362
Mandy.

04:54.395 --> 04:57.164
Mandy. Mandy, look at me!

04:58.198 --> 04:59.299
Uh, sorry.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.101
Thank you so much.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.938
Uh, most people have the camera
off when they're home, but...

05:04.972 --> 05:06.907
you guys do what you want.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.080
Do I hear dessert?

05:16.216 --> 05:18.151
I made douhua.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.653
What is it?

05:19.687 --> 05:21.555
It is a traditional pudding
from Hong Kong.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.556
MIKE:
Huh.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.058
Still dessert, right?

05:28.496 --> 05:30.364
-Mmm. Mmm!
-Mm. Yeah.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.099
I like that.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.969
Yeah, it's creamy. And sweet.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.671
But it's not too sweet.

05:37.705 --> 05:38.839
It's made with tofu.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.107
Oh.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.179
You tricked me.
Are you proud of yourself?

05:47.415 --> 05:49.082
-Vanessa?
-VANESSA: Mom!

05:49.116 --> 05:51.051
What are you doing here? You're
gonna be late for your flight.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.686
Something happened,
and I thought it would be best

05:52.720 --> 05:54.221
to tell you in person.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.723
Did something happen
with Grandma? (stammers)

05:55.756 --> 05:56.857
-She's so young.
-N...

05:56.890 --> 05:58.926
She's 99.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.428
No, it's...

06:00.461 --> 06:01.929
-Grandma's fine.
-Oh, good.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.431
99 isn't that old.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.766
A lot of people live longer
than that in Hong Kong,

06:05.799 --> 06:08.135
because we have
better health care.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.907
But... yay, USA.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.110
(exhales)
Mom, what? What?

06:17.144 --> 06:19.880
Bonnie and I
are no longer dating.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.049
-What?
-Well, Ed told me

06:22.082 --> 06:24.084
that it was causing problems
for you at work, so...

06:24.117 --> 06:25.719
Why would you say that?

06:25.753 --> 06:28.556
As I said before,
we're no longer dating...

06:28.589 --> 06:30.524
Because...

06:30.558 --> 06:33.093
we're getting married.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.763
You tricked us.
You proud of yourselves?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.872
-You're getting married?
-Yes.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.440
Isn't it crazy?

06:46.474 --> 06:47.908
Totally.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.376
(chuckles)

06:49.409 --> 06:53.046
The correct response would be,
"Congratulations."

06:53.080 --> 06:54.948
Yes, yes, of course.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.550
Yes, uh, congratulations.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.885
I am so happy.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.319
Oh, I have to call Mom.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.955
She won't know who I am,
but she loves weddings.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.090
It's just... Okay.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.326
Thanks, Mike.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.796
This never would have happened
without you.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.833
He keeps saying that.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.835
You know,
I'd like to say, "Young love,"

07:14.868 --> 07:17.004
-but that ain't it.
-(sighs)

07:17.037 --> 07:20.273
You couldn't help yourself,
could you, Mike?

07:20.307 --> 07:22.776
I asked you to do one thing--

07:22.810 --> 07:25.178
not to mess with
my mom's relationship with Ed.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.147
I just talked to him about work.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.516
I didn't want you
to talk to him at all.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.150
Well, how do we know
this is even my fault?

07:30.183 --> 07:31.318
Maybe they're covering
the real problem.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.319
Like what?

07:32.352 --> 07:34.454
Maybe your mom's pregnant.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.456
Oh, God.
(exhales)

07:36.490 --> 07:40.861
No. My-my mom was finally
standing on her own two feet,

07:40.894 --> 07:43.864
and now she's just been swept
off them.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.033
I know. It's because
he's been married four times.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.035
Uh, look, that he's been
married four times

07:48.068 --> 07:50.971
doesn't bother me--
it's the four divorces.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.540
Well, he didn't want
to get divorced.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.008
I'm sure
he would rather they died.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.610
Honey,

07:56.644 --> 07:59.112
-people change. You know that.
-No.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.714
No, look, if Ed
was marrying somebody else,

08:00.748 --> 08:02.149
I could sit back
and root for him.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.951
-But this is my mother.
-I know.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.654
It's my mother. It's not a risk
I want her to take.

08:06.687 --> 08:07.988
Well, what are we supposed
to do about it?

08:08.021 --> 08:11.358
(sighs)
Well, you-you should talk to Ed.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.161
Isn't that how we got here

08:14.194 --> 08:16.129
-in the first place?
-(groans)

08:16.163 --> 08:18.832
Look, if Ed divorces my mom,
it will kill her.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.634
It will kill her,
which will kill me.

08:20.668 --> 08:24.237
And, trust me,
it won't stop there.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.710
Just want to install
this low-flow showerhead.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.679
It's gonna save us hundreds.
I mean, you know how much

08:31.712 --> 08:33.046
the two of them wash their hair.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.249
-(screams) Oh, my God!
-What? Wh-What happened?

08:36.283 --> 08:38.351
(stammers) I saw a mouse!
He ran under the sink!

08:38.385 --> 08:39.753
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I-I believe you.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.221
-I don't have to look. Thanks.
-Oh...

08:41.254 --> 08:42.890
Ew, we have mice.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.992
Mandy and Kyle
are gonna freak out.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.327
(sighs) Okay. Well, they're
not moving in for a few weeks,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.162
so I will deal with it.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.864
Oh, babe,
it's right here on the counter.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.099
Oh.
(chuckles)

08:52.132 --> 08:54.101
My grandma used to say
I'd lose my head

08:54.134 --> 08:56.069
if it wasn't attached
by my thyroid, cartilage,

08:56.103 --> 08:58.606
C7 and T1 vertebrae.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.840
(phone chimes)

08:59.873 --> 09:01.942
Hey, it's our security system.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.944
Oh, it's Ryan and Kristin.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.279
I promise
I will get rid of them.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.348
What? Is he talking about us?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.517
Yeah, I feel gross just knowing
that they're up here,

09:10.550 --> 09:12.319
with their beady little eyes.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.590
-They make me sick.
-It's too bad,

09:16.624 --> 09:18.391
-'cause they're kind of cute.
-(scoffs)

09:18.425 --> 09:20.193
No, they're not.
They're disgusting.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.430
And they leave their poop
everywhere!

09:25.398 --> 09:27.034
No!

09:27.067 --> 09:31.538
This is, like,
the meanest reality show ever.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.741
Turn it off.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.043
-I'm really upset.
-Me, too.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.945
I'm gonna go wash my hair.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.981
Hey, save me some conditioner.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.954
-Hey, Ed.
-Hmm?

09:46.987 --> 09:49.222
There's a new
Mission: Impossible movie out.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.558
You know what the problem
with those movies are?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.226
Yeah, they all end the same way.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.829
So why are you
getting married again?

09:55.863 --> 09:59.132
Oh, you're diving right in,
aren't you, Mike?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.634
-Yeah, you know,
I'm just wondering
-Yeah.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.969
if you really
thought this through, pal.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.303
Oh, I have.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.072
I'm in love with the woman.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.339
I know you are.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.141
So does everybody
within hugging range.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.811
Why not just keep things
the way they are?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.412
Because things the way they are

10:12.445 --> 10:15.148
means there are 1,800 miles
between us.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.617
-Okay?
-I know.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.187
But I'm just going by
the previous four marriages.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.955
Seems to me,
being in the same house

10:21.989 --> 10:24.692
didn't prove to be the charm.

10:24.725 --> 10:28.161
You know, Bonnie is a woman
of class, of character,

10:28.195 --> 10:30.163
and she deserves
to be treated as such.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.999
She's not some floozy,
some tart,

10:32.032 --> 10:34.702
or some dance hall girl.

10:34.735 --> 10:38.505
Can we leave the golden age
of jazz just for a moment?

10:38.538 --> 10:41.008
Listen...
(grunts)

10:41.041 --> 10:44.011
you know how many times
Bonnie's been married? Once.

10:44.044 --> 10:48.148
And it was one of those "till
death do us part" marriages.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.317
This has to be
the real deal, Ed.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.953
You think I haven't thought
about that?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.521
I guess I would feel
a lot better

10:54.554 --> 10:56.389
hearing you say that you have.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.958
You know,
I'm finding it very hard

10:57.991 --> 10:59.993
not to feel insulted right now.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.229
I'm just coming from the fact
I was your best man

11:02.262 --> 11:04.798
at the last four
Mission: Impossible movies.

11:04.832 --> 11:08.869
Well, maybe you'll just have
to sit this one out.

11:18.912 --> 11:19.980
MIKE:
Hey, guys, come on in.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.049
-Hi.
-BONNIE: Yeah.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.250
-Hi.
-Yeah.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.253
Vanessa, always a delight
to see you.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.921
Sir.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.090
So, what is this about, honey?

11:30.123 --> 11:31.491
Please, come on in, guys,
sit down.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.426
Everybody, come on and sit down.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.997
Uh... well, looks like
there's been a lot of talk

11:37.030 --> 11:39.099
about Bonnie and Ed's
relationship

11:39.132 --> 11:40.433
behind closed doors.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.069
There has? Wow.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.603
Who-who's-who's been talking?

11:43.636 --> 11:45.973
Well, I, for one. And...

11:50.310 --> 11:52.412
It would appear just me.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.782
Well, I was behind one
of those doors when you made

11:54.815 --> 11:58.085
your opinion about my
shortcomings abundantly clear.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.088
Wait, Michael.
Do you... do you have a problem

12:01.121 --> 12:03.156
with Ed and me getting married?

12:05.625 --> 12:08.128
Let's just say
there's a problem,

12:08.161 --> 12:10.097
and I'm the one talking
about it.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.166
Unless somebody else wants
to join in.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.038
Well, I don't think anybody else
has a problem, Mike.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.941
It would appear that way.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.876
And yet...

12:22.910 --> 12:24.878
And yet what?

12:24.912 --> 12:27.380
-Really? Is that it?
-Oh, fine, fine.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.783
Look, it-it was me;
I-I have the problem.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.886
-Really?
-You?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.922
My apologies, Mike.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.158
Apparently, I was angry
at the wrong viper.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.960
I am worried about my mom, Ed.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.895
She's finally happy.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.164
Well, I'm sorry I made
your mother happy.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.499
I'm a horrible man.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.336
Yeah, but you made four
other women happy, as well,

12:49.369 --> 12:51.071
and then you divorced them.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.540
Which only made them happier.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.912
Look, my mother is finally doing
what she wants,

12:58.946 --> 13:01.348
and I don't want her
to just throw that away.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.016
I see.

13:03.050 --> 13:06.519
You-you don't want Ed
to dictate how I live my life.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.089
-Yes, exactly.
-Because you want to.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.024
What? No, no, Mom.

13:11.058 --> 13:14.995
Honey, honey, it does seem
that that's what you're saying.

13:19.666 --> 13:23.003
I said "honey."

13:23.036 --> 13:25.839
For your information,

13:25.873 --> 13:29.042
I was the one who proposed
to Ed.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.010
You did?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.044
Yes.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.880
And there were some conditions.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.982
One being that we live here

13:35.015 --> 13:37.484
so that I could be close
to my daughter.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.721
Oh. Oh, wh... (stammering)

13:41.754 --> 13:45.192
Oh, see, this is why
I wanted us to talk.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.964
I am in control of my life,

13:50.998 --> 13:55.202
and I have no intention
of giving that up to anyone.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.071
-(sighs) Now, Eddie?
-Hmm?

13:58.105 --> 14:00.073
-I am hungry...
-Yes. Mm-hmm.

14:00.107 --> 14:03.410
...and I would like you
to take me to dinner.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.179
Very good. I have a few words
to say to Vanessa first.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.549
-Edward!
-Y-Yes, dear. Right away.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.552
Isn't she magnificent, huh?

14:14.587 --> 14:16.423
-(door closes)
-VANESSA: Mm.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.359
This is a time for pie.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.532
(knocking on door)

14:27.367 --> 14:29.002
Hey, got your text.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.271
Oh, did you, Ryan?

14:33.573 --> 14:34.874
Did you get my text?

14:34.908 --> 14:37.210
Hey, Mandy, he got my text.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.047
Isn't that nice.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.349
Good for you, Ryan.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.018
Uh, are you guys okay?
You seem upset.

14:45.052 --> 14:49.056
Oh, just upset?
Not filthy? Not gross?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.258
Okay, you know what?
Why don't, um...

14:51.291 --> 14:53.360
why don't we have this
conversation downstairs?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.063
Oh, wow, you just can't wait
to get us out of here, can you?

14:56.096 --> 14:57.364
Yeah, let's get to it,
Ryan, okay?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.099
We know you and Kristin's
little secret.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.634
Oh, boy. (sighs)
How'd you find out?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.536
Yeah. See that smoke detector?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.038
It's a camera.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.007
And a smoke detector.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.776
Sometimes a security system

15:09.809 --> 15:11.979
protects you from people
you already know.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.148
Hey, hon. Oh, hey, guys.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.553
What?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.555
They installed
a security camera, Kris.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.124
They know everything.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.759
Oh, no. Ooh.

15:26.793 --> 15:30.163
So they saw I put out
some poison?

15:31.965 --> 15:34.001
-Wha...
-Poison?

15:34.034 --> 15:36.136
Oh, my God.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.138
I know it sounds inhumane,
but really,

15:38.171 --> 15:40.607
it's just the quickest way
to get it over with.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.178
Well, that's thoughtful, Ryan,
but still horrible.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.081
I mean, if Ryan wasn't
so squeamish about it,

15:48.115 --> 15:50.183
I would've run over and grabbed
one of Dad's guns.

15:50.217 --> 15:53.153
(gasps)

15:53.186 --> 15:55.989
Uh, couldn't you just ask us
to leave?

15:56.023 --> 15:59.759
Ask you to leave? No, the whole
point is to keep you in here.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.196
Wha... Wha... Behind the wall?

16:03.230 --> 16:05.365
Uh, hold up. I'm sorry.
(chuckling)

16:05.398 --> 16:08.301
What exactly do you guys think
is going on here?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.702
Oh, we know what's going on.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.104
You want to get rid of us

16:11.138 --> 16:13.940
because we broke
one tiny cabinet.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.143
What? No. No, no. (chuckling)

16:16.176 --> 16:17.844
We... we found a mouse,
and we were trying

16:17.877 --> 16:19.712
to get rid of it
before you guys moved in.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.115
All right, nice try. A mouse.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.018
Because mice are "filthy,"
and they "poop everywhere,"

16:25.052 --> 16:28.421
and you "use poison to get rid
of..." Oh, it is a mouse.

16:31.524 --> 16:35.295
So... you don't want to kill us?

16:35.328 --> 16:38.698
Not before this conversation.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.167
(chuckles) Hang on.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.135
-You broke a cabinet?
-Wha...

16:42.169 --> 16:44.637
Honey, honey. No, no, it's fine.
We'll fix it, okay?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.206
The important thing
is there is no one

16:46.239 --> 16:49.076
we would rather have living here
than you two.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.877
She's right. You know what?
Everything is cool.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.845
And I promise
I will get rid of the mouse

16:52.879 --> 16:55.182
-before you guys move in.
-No, no, no,
don't get rid of it.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.584
Maybe it'll become friends
with the one that we keep here.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.018
(both laughing)

17:03.190 --> 17:05.092
Knock, knock.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.893
Viper who?

17:06.926 --> 17:08.228
No, I didn't say viper.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.097
I, uh, uh, n-never mind.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.731
Um...

17:11.764 --> 17:14.501
Look, I uh...
I brought a peace offering.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.702
-Ah.
-Yeah.

17:15.735 --> 17:16.936
It's-it's scotch.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.572
I was hoping maybe
we could "tape"

17:19.606 --> 17:22.575
our relationship back together.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.944
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

17:24.977 --> 17:28.047
Well, booze and a pun--
what's not to like?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.951
All right, look, Ed, um...

17:31.984 --> 17:35.054
I never should have questioned
your commitment to my mom.

17:35.088 --> 17:39.092
You suggest a man doesn't
deserve the love of his life...

17:39.126 --> 17:42.462
and you think a bottle of scotch
is gonna make things right?

17:42.495 --> 17:45.132
Well, I was hoping so. I-I mean,
I-I have another bottle

17:45.165 --> 17:47.300
in the car if you think
it's gonna take two.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.970
That really hurt, Vanessa.

17:51.003 --> 17:54.941
I know. I know.
I-I'm... I'm so sorry.

17:54.974 --> 17:58.711
Look, I... I was just trying
to protect my mom from...

17:58.745 --> 18:01.881
I-I mean, I didn't want her
to get into a... (stammering)

18:01.914 --> 18:05.785
I mean, yeah, I... yeah, I was
just trying to protect my mom.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.655
Look, I know my track record.
All right?

18:08.688 --> 18:11.458
I wanted to propose
to your mother three months ago.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.959
Hmm? Well, what stopped you?

18:12.992 --> 18:15.428
My track record.

18:15.462 --> 18:19.098
In the past, I decided
to get married on impulse.

18:19.132 --> 18:22.001
And so, so why did you do things
differently this time?

18:22.034 --> 18:23.670
I didn't.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.138
Your mother did.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.973
VANESSA:
Mm.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.008
For months, I agonized,
wondering if I really deserved

18:29.041 --> 18:32.078
that woman, and I'll be damned
if she didn't propose to me.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.946
(chuckling) Gosh, I just...

18:33.980 --> 18:36.949
I can't picture my mother
doing that.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.651
She took a knee
in the restaurant.

18:38.685 --> 18:42.121
Three waiters ran over
to help her up.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.991
Other than that,
the service was slow.

18:45.024 --> 18:49.362
If you had doubts, Ed,
why did you say yes?

18:49.396 --> 18:51.464
Well, I was just hoping your...

18:51.498 --> 18:54.033
your mother's judgment
was better than mine.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.870
So, you see, we both have
the same doubts.

18:57.904 --> 19:01.274
It's just easier for me
to be mad at you about them.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.277
Well, maybe we're both wrong.

19:04.311 --> 19:08.948
But, look, this time
is already different.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.450
How so?

19:10.483 --> 19:13.019
Well, you broke the pattern.

19:13.052 --> 19:17.023
You wanted to be impulsive,
but-but you waited.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.958
-Hmm, I did, didn't I?
-Yeah.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.027
Oh, may-maybe I've grown.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.129
Maybe I'm finally learning
from my past.

19:23.162 --> 19:27.200
Okay, yeah, well...
let's go with that.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.135
All right.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.204
You're a good friend, Vanessa.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.206
Uh... (clears throat)

19:33.240 --> 19:35.074
Or you're just buttering me up

19:35.107 --> 19:37.877
because I'm going to be
your stepfather.

19:37.910 --> 19:41.448
You are really gonna hate
the boy I'm seeing.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.685
Thank you.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.053
Oh, bring it in.

19:47.086 --> 19:50.223
-(chuckling)
-There you go. Mm.

19:50.257 --> 19:54.060
Ah, I'm sorry about the cologne.
It's Chuck's.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.495
Hmm.

19:55.528 --> 19:59.065
Now, speaking
of breaking patterns...

19:59.098 --> 20:01.401
how would you like to be
my best man?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.202
Mike's always your best man.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.705
Yeah, I know.
I'm just thinking that maybe...

20:05.738 --> 20:08.107
maybe he's the jinx.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.916
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.118
They say it's a dog's life.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.288
A dog-eat-dog world.

20:21.321 --> 20:25.892
Put a poodle in a tuxedo,
they call it "doggie style."

20:25.925 --> 20:29.061
But you can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

20:29.095 --> 20:32.899
We spend way too much time
thinking about dogs.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.034
What people should be doing
is making sure

20:35.067 --> 20:38.405
they can learn new tricks,
that they can change.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.407
German philosopher
Georg Hegel wrote,

20:40.440 --> 20:45.211
"We learn from history that we
do not learn from history."

20:45.244 --> 20:49.048
Smart guy who wrote nothing
about dogs.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.918
Maybe he was right when it comes
to countries and cultures,

20:51.951 --> 20:56.155
but I know for a fact
that individuals can change.

20:56.188 --> 21:00.727
I've got a buddy who drove
a half-ton pickup for 26 years.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.995
You know what he drives now?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.932
A three-quarter-ton pickup.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.501
See? Change.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.770
And maybe the reason
I have such deep faith

21:10.803 --> 21:12.972
that people can alter
the course of their lives

21:13.005 --> 21:14.974
is because
I've experienced it myself.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.577
If you don't believe me, I've
got some pictures to show you

21:17.610 --> 21:20.680
of a young hippy named Mike,
who... (chuckles)

21:20.713 --> 21:24.150
who thought George McGovern
should be president.

21:24.183 --> 21:27.354
(inhales) Sure.

21:29.622 --> 21:34.160
Took me a second to figure out
that dog just wasn't gonna hunt.

21:34.193 --> 21:36.295
Baxter out.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.366
(chicken clucks)

21:39.399 --> 21:41.233
