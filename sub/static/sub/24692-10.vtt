00:04.883 --> 00:07.435
In New York City's war on crime,

00:07.435 --> 00:10.564
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:10.564 --> 00:12.448
of the Major Case Squad.

00:12.448 --> 00:14.238
These are their stories.

00:18.190 --> 00:19.466
Hi.

00:19.905 --> 00:22.790
So it's me, Willow.
Again.

00:22.790 --> 00:27.601
A lot of you commented on a fight that
Holden and I had in yesterday's video.

00:29.245 --> 00:31.787
It wasn't really a fight.

00:32.008 --> 00:34.447
Granted, a few of the things
he said did hurt me,

00:34.447 --> 00:39.438
like when he said just once he wished
I'd read something other than catalogues.

00:39.438 --> 00:41.541
Like that's not reading.

00:42.266 --> 00:43.754
It's not.

00:48.530 --> 00:49.626
Okay.

00:49.626 --> 00:53.687
So Holden is still reading his way through
that box of hard-boiled detective novels

00:53.687 --> 00:55.585
he got on Canal street.

00:55.585 --> 00:58.627
Lurid covers and insect stains.

00:58.930 --> 01:01.093
I think he needs to be distracted.

01:04.769 --> 01:06.136
Ready?

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.925 --> 01:21.343
Is it working?

01:25.908 --> 01:26.598
You ready?

01:26.598 --> 01:28.920
You ready?
Here we go, here we go.

01:51.504 --> 01:54.642
So, here's what I want to know.

01:54.642 --> 01:56.943
Why don't we go anywhere anymore?

01:56.943 --> 01:58.378
He's so lame.

01:58.378 --> 01:59.953
I don't care. I mean...

02:09.645 --> 02:11.198
Cut! Cut!

02:19.589 --> 02:22.150
What the hell was that?

02:22.578 --> 02:26.350
We may have just witnessed
the first cyber-kidnapping.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2006/11/28

03:16.152 --> 03:17.842
"Weeping Willow 17"?

03:17.842 --> 03:19.428
Never heard of her.

03:19.428 --> 03:22.042
She's been posting her vlog
on youlenz for months.

03:22.042 --> 03:23.611
My nephew's crazy about her.

03:23.611 --> 03:25.112
Her vlog?

03:25.112 --> 03:27.981
Like blog with a V.
It's a video diary.

03:27.981 --> 03:30.749
She's getting up to
half a million hits a day.

03:30.749 --> 03:33.799
I mean, is this just
some huge marketing ploy,

03:33.799 --> 03:35.767
or is she a runaway with a webcam?

03:35.767 --> 03:37.051
My vote, web hoax.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.665
We all heard her yell "cut."

03:38.665 --> 03:41.486
Yeah, so did the guys with hoods,
but they didn't stop.

03:41.486 --> 03:43.845
Since this vlog posted 2 hours ago,

03:43.845 --> 03:46.843
over 3,000 calls are coming to NYPD.

03:46.843 --> 03:48.895
From as far away as Perth.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.296
In cyberspace,
everyone hears you scream.

03:51.296 --> 03:53.600
These callers think
they witnessed a brutal crime.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.821
If they're right,

03:54.821 --> 03:56.214
we need to find the victims.

03:56.214 --> 03:57.880
And if it is a hoax?

03:57.880 --> 03:59.283
We need to expose it.

03:59.283 --> 04:01.828
Well, cyber or not,
if this kidnapping is real,

04:01.828 --> 04:03.974
their next step would be a ransom note.

04:03.974 --> 04:07.081
Let's start by tracing the server
they used to upload the video.

04:07.081 --> 04:11.609
I tried that, but it was routed
through special proxies, a tor server.

04:11.609 --> 04:12.876
In English, Ira.

04:12.876 --> 04:15.653
It's a way of posting anonymously online.

04:16.635 --> 04:20.050
Why would a teenage vlogger
hide her server?

04:20.050 --> 04:20.985
Exactly.

04:20.985 --> 04:25.462
When you look at her sophisticated
editing, her high-end webcam,

04:25.462 --> 04:27.168
she isn't who she said she is.

04:27.168 --> 04:30.280
Excuse me, can you just blow up
this view out the window here?

04:30.280 --> 04:31.685
Sure.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.385
There you go, those buildings
in the background.

04:35.385 --> 04:37.904
One has red brick.
The other has yellow brick.

04:37.904 --> 04:39.949
That's gotta be Clinton village
on 1st avenue.

04:39.949 --> 04:43.250
Go. If this is real, the first
24 hours are ticking away.

04:43.582 --> 04:45.617
If this is real.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.060
Sorry.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.704
Thanks for your time.

04:51.914 --> 04:54.249
Okay, man, I appreciate that.

04:55.252 --> 04:57.419
That's the third guard
who recognized her photo,

04:57.419 --> 04:59.360
but from the web, not from here.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.618
Well, property management said

05:00.618 --> 05:02.528
all tenants have been
issued photo ID cards.

05:02.528 --> 05:04.574
The only problem is there
could be a thousand

05:04.574 --> 05:06.617
illegal roommates and sublets in here.

05:06.617 --> 05:08.702
Yeah. And they don't sign leases.

05:08.702 --> 05:09.997
There are 7,000 units.

05:09.997 --> 05:11.584
No way we go door-to-door here.

05:11.584 --> 05:13.789
How about store-to-store?

05:16.281 --> 05:17.862
You say high speed.

05:17.862 --> 05:20.303
Well, how high is high? 5,200?

05:20.303 --> 05:21.992
No, bigger. Faster.

05:21.992 --> 05:23.792
- And the webcam?
- Integrated.

05:23.792 --> 05:27.172
- 1.3 megapixel?
- Wow.

05:27.437 --> 05:30.353
Yeah, we just got those in September.

05:30.353 --> 05:32.499
You remember selling one to her?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.058
Willow!

05:34.264 --> 05:35.533
That kidnapping was staged, right?

05:35.533 --> 05:37.076
You could hear her say "cut" at the end.

05:37.076 --> 05:39.652
We don't know.
Was she in the store?

05:40.619 --> 05:41.617
I wish.

05:41.617 --> 05:43.375
How about him?

05:43.375 --> 05:44.396
Holden.

05:44.396 --> 05:46.878
Uh, yeah.
Early Fall.

05:46.878 --> 05:49.174
I never really pay attention
to him in her videos.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.601
Did he maybe pay
by credit card or check?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.597
Cash. Small bills.

05:53.597 --> 05:56.354
Uh, I remember we got into a fight.

05:56.354 --> 05:57.848
He wanted a student discount,

05:57.848 --> 06:00.599
but his school ID was expired.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.260
What school, Bob?

06:02.260 --> 06:04.353
Uh, New York film academy.

06:04.353 --> 06:05.931
Thank you, Bob.

06:08.036 --> 06:09.424
Bye.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.417
But that's not editing, Miles.

06:12.417 --> 06:15.058
That's just death by a thousand cuts.

06:15.058 --> 06:18.387
That's just visual masturbation.

06:18.387 --> 06:19.760
Thank you.

06:20.668 --> 06:22.284
You'll get it.

06:23.388 --> 06:28.368
This generation, it's all width,
no depth, no theme, no narrative.

06:28.368 --> 06:30.332
It's like your weeping Willow videos.

06:30.332 --> 06:32.923
Amateur hour.
The lighting, the editing,

06:32.923 --> 06:36.641
and don't even get me started
on the so-called "story arc."

06:36.641 --> 06:40.609
Look, we're really only interested
in whether or not you recognize this kid

06:40.609 --> 06:42.150
who calls himself Holden.

06:42.150 --> 06:43.000
I can assure you,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.644
no student of mine is involved
in weeping Willow 17.

06:45.644 --> 06:48.094
Even the title is derivative.

06:48.348 --> 06:50.845
Do you recognize this young man?

06:52.516 --> 06:55.387
Well, he's certainly not a current student.

06:55.387 --> 06:56.820
Well...

06:57.029 --> 06:58.835
does that mean he's a former student?

06:58.835 --> 07:00.837
Just for a semester, you know.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.410
He dropped out a year and a half ago.

07:03.410 --> 07:05.574
James Cameron wannabe.

07:05.574 --> 07:07.675
You know, sliver of raw talent.

07:07.675 --> 07:11.013
But, of course, he was too arrogant
to think he needed to learn anything.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.874
Does he have a name?

07:13.298 --> 07:14.560
Foster.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.910
D.H. Foster.

07:17.397 --> 07:19.349
How about a current address?

07:19.349 --> 07:21.475
Look, I'm not just a teacher.
I'm a filmmaker.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.717
I don't have time to look up
where everybody lives.

07:23.717 --> 07:24.662
I don't know!

07:24.662 --> 07:26.572
Then I guess you wouldn't
know where he was from.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.295
He was from someplace
way out in the boondocks.

07:29.295 --> 07:32.321
I don't know, Elmira, New York
or something like that.

07:32.321 --> 07:33.719
Elmira?

07:33.719 --> 07:36.010
Yeah. Elmira.

07:37.171 --> 07:39.348
Do me a favor, professor.

07:40.412 --> 07:42.761
Don't tell anyone about this
for now, okay?

07:42.761 --> 07:44.567
Don't worry.

07:45.060 --> 07:48.108
All this publicity,
the guy doesn't deserve it.

07:48.108 --> 07:49.914
We have to go.

07:49.914 --> 07:51.186
Hey!

07:51.527 --> 07:53.936
Was I right? Ransom note?

07:53.936 --> 07:55.464
Yes and no.

07:57.634 --> 08:00.374
Read. Loud.

08:02.456 --> 08:03.449
Okay.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.922
"Listen up, people."

08:04.922 --> 08:06.948
"I'm Willow and I'm here with Holden."

08:06.948 --> 08:09.638
"We've not been harmed
but please, please,"

08:09.638 --> 08:14.131
"all of our fans go to the
freewillow17.com website now."

08:14.131 --> 08:16.553
"Download some of our archive videos."

08:16.553 --> 08:19.447
"They're available for $1.99."

08:19.667 --> 08:22.143
If they're gonna be able
to get outta here and make more videos,

08:22.143 --> 08:26.636
we will need 100,000 downloads
within the next 48 hours.

08:27.486 --> 08:29.354
Otherwise...

08:29.636 --> 08:32.096
they're gonna be
logged off for good!

08:32.096 --> 08:33.429
Bang!

08:34.280 --> 08:36.758
Kidnap the victims,
wait a few hours,

08:36.758 --> 08:38.226
then demand a ransom.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.284
Same game, different playing field.

08:40.284 --> 08:44.018
Yeah. Except this time they're
asking strangers for the ransom money.

08:44.018 --> 08:47.233
They didn't call it ransom.
They called it download fees.

08:47.233 --> 08:50.000
A buck 99 from 100,000 different people.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.262
Those little jerks just might get it.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.797
She did look terrified.

08:54.797 --> 08:57.924
Yeah, and in earlier videos,
she would flirt and be petulant.

08:57.924 --> 08:59.433
I mean, she's acting.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.137
You think it's real?

09:02.864 --> 09:04.693
I don't know.

09:04.693 --> 09:07.764
Give me a body with some
blood on it at a crime scene,

09:07.764 --> 09:09.982
I'm a happy camper.

09:09.982 --> 09:13.456
A cyber crime scene,
I don't know what to make of this.

09:13.456 --> 09:15.010
Check the digipay website.

09:15.010 --> 09:16.953
Someone must have registered
something with them.

09:16.953 --> 09:18.935
The digipay people are taking the position

09:18.935 --> 09:22.308
that this is a right to privacy issue
and a First amendment issue.

09:22.308 --> 09:24.572
- Oh, please, what a bunch of jerks.
- Listen,

09:24.572 --> 09:27.636
the DA's office won't go to bat
until we can establish proof

09:27.636 --> 09:30.754
that real people are missing
or that a crime has been committed.

09:30.754 --> 09:32.744
Any leads on this D.H. Foster kid?

09:32.744 --> 09:34.928
He dropped out of film school
a year and a half ago.

09:34.928 --> 09:36.344
No emergency contact numbers,

09:36.344 --> 09:40.742
but the film school said that they have
an Elmira high school transcript from 2004.

09:40.742 --> 09:44.585
Find out if anyone up there
remembers him or her.

09:44.814 --> 09:47.232
In the meantime, I'll...

09:47.964 --> 09:49.759
meet the press.

09:54.597 --> 09:57.390
They have not been
positively identified.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.198
We are asking the public for assistance.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.982
We have a tip line set up for anyone

10:00.982 --> 10:02.732
who can identify these two young people.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.672
What about shutting down
the digipay account?

10:04.672 --> 10:06.282
We are in discussions with them.

10:06.282 --> 10:08.693
Is this all just an elaborate hoax?

10:08.944 --> 10:11.035
We can't be certain.

10:11.035 --> 10:14.319
Our priority is to make sure
no innocent lives are harmed

10:14.319 --> 10:16.453
and that the public is not duped.

10:16.453 --> 10:20.247
Please do not allow these cyberthugs
to hold you hostage

10:20.247 --> 10:22.128
by sending them your hard-earned money.

10:22.128 --> 10:23.263
If it's not a hoax,

10:23.263 --> 10:26.139
then you've just encouraged the public
to ignore the ransom demand.

10:26.139 --> 10:28.745
Willow and Holden could be killed.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.481
Look, we're committed to
a peaceful end to the situation

10:32.481 --> 10:34.851
where nobody gets hurt,
including the public.

10:34.851 --> 10:37.106
Thank you very much for coming out.

10:46.592 --> 10:49.794
D.H. Foster.

10:49.994 --> 10:52.007
Oh, now I remember him.

10:52.007 --> 10:53.887
He transferred in his senior year.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.866
I think his family was military.

10:55.866 --> 10:59.071
He became that "mysterious boy
from far away."

10:59.071 --> 11:00.555
The one all the girls had a crush on?

11:00.555 --> 11:02.065
And the one the boys hated.

11:02.065 --> 11:03.331
What about Willow?

11:03.331 --> 11:04.687
I checked with admissions,

11:04.687 --> 11:06.487
and we don't have a match for her name.

11:06.487 --> 11:09.425
But the face...

11:09.758 --> 11:13.621
there was a girl who registered
in 2004, very shy.

11:13.621 --> 11:16.361
She didn't last two weeks.

11:16.361 --> 11:18.905
Different hair and thick glasses but...

11:18.905 --> 11:20.257
could be her.

11:20.257 --> 11:21.977
She dropped out?

11:21.977 --> 11:23.713
She'd been home-schooled all her life.

11:23.713 --> 11:25.707
I think she was a little overwhelmed.

11:25.707 --> 11:27.447
Well, we'd love to get
in touch with her.

11:27.447 --> 11:28.997
Any ideas?

11:29.296 --> 11:33.487
I bet she went back to the family farm
and never set foot outside it again.

11:37.239 --> 11:41.208
Please, somebody help us.

11:41.443 --> 11:42.906
Listen.

11:42.906 --> 11:44.436
Holden...

11:44.983 --> 11:47.500
He tried to escape
and they caught him.

11:48.112 --> 11:50.976
Please, just do what they want.
They're...

11:50.976 --> 11:52.708
they're beating him.

11:54.159 --> 11:57.749
Please just go to the site
and download those videos.

11:57.749 --> 11:59.245
I know some of you
think I'm a fake,

11:59.245 --> 12:01.132
but I'm a real person.

12:01.132 --> 12:02.313
Please.

12:02.313 --> 12:03.869
Please listen to me.

12:03.869 --> 12:06.081
My name is Lisa Willow Tyler.

12:06.081 --> 12:08.674
I'm from Elmira, New York.
If someone...

12:08.674 --> 12:12.197
if someone could tell my mom, please.

12:12.549 --> 12:15.185
We're live from the Tyler farm
in Elmira, New York,

12:15.185 --> 12:18.016
asking the question
everyone wants answered.

12:18.016 --> 12:20.150
Is it real or is it fake?

12:20.150 --> 12:24.101
It's been 24 hours since tape
of her supposed kidnap hit the web,

12:24.101 --> 12:26.670
and since then,
thousands of her internet fans

12:26.670 --> 12:29.971
have responded to her alleged
kidnappers' ransom demands.

12:29.971 --> 12:32.870
Please, just do what they want.
They're...

12:32.870 --> 12:34.395
they're beating him.

12:35.590 --> 12:38.151
Our Lisa in a movie?

12:38.151 --> 12:41.306
It, it looks like her,
but it can't be.

12:41.306 --> 12:44.436
You don't think anything's
happened to her, do you?

12:44.436 --> 12:45.893
We don't know.

12:46.262 --> 12:48.288
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

12:48.288 --> 12:51.450
Oh, she called about a month ago.

12:51.450 --> 12:53.124
Forgive me for asking this.

12:53.124 --> 12:56.368
Um, is Lisa your daughter
or your granddaughter?

12:56.368 --> 12:57.853
No, she's ours.

12:57.853 --> 13:00.462
We called her our miracle baby.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.500
So I guess she doesn't
check in too often?

13:03.500 --> 13:05.121
Well, she's in Africa.

13:05.121 --> 13:08.263
She doesn't have regular
access to a phone.

13:08.263 --> 13:09.353
In Africa?

13:09.353 --> 13:13.448
She's spending a year in Cameroon
through the world healths care foundation

13:13.448 --> 13:15.853
helping to build schools.

13:17.044 --> 13:19.798
You get many postcards from Africa?

13:20.447 --> 13:21.992
No.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.610
But she did send this.

13:29.378 --> 13:33.206
It's a traditional
Cameroon musical instrument.

13:34.095 --> 13:38.261
I'm sorry, but this is
an Australian instrument.

13:38.261 --> 13:41.756
There's a kangaroo design
burnt right into it.

13:43.710 --> 13:45.965
I don't understand.

13:45.965 --> 13:50.089
Mr. And Mrs. Tyler, your
daughter has been lying to you.

13:50.650 --> 13:52.302
Excuse me.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.566
Do you remember how she
sent you this instrument?

13:56.566 --> 14:01.908
A childhood friend of hers
brought it to us, Suzie Waller.

14:02.928 --> 14:05.669
Of course Lisa made up
that story about Africa.

14:05.669 --> 14:08.496
If her parents knew she was
in New York with Holden, they'd freak.

14:08.496 --> 14:12.523
They didn't even let her
listen to rock music, no cable TV.

14:12.523 --> 14:14.482
Her mom sewed her dresses.

14:14.482 --> 14:15.849
No boyfriends.

14:15.849 --> 14:17.038
A lonely life.

14:17.038 --> 14:18.925
She used to meet Holden at my house.

14:18.925 --> 14:20.498
She do that a lot?

14:20.498 --> 14:22.859
Sneak around, make up stories?

14:22.859 --> 14:26.508
Just white lies.
She's a good girl.

14:26.508 --> 14:29.355
And Holden, kind of a bad boy?

14:29.355 --> 14:31.814
He could talk.
I'll give him that.

14:32.633 --> 14:35.741
Uh, could you just for a sec?

14:36.483 --> 14:37.382
Thanks.

14:37.382 --> 14:39.466
You've seen her video logs?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.825
I have a full-time job,
a part-time job,

14:41.825 --> 14:43.376
and an 8-month-old son.

14:43.376 --> 14:45.636
I don't really have a lot of
time for surfing the net.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.023
She made up a trip to Africa.

14:47.023 --> 14:49.338
You don't think she could have
made up this kidnapping?

14:49.338 --> 14:52.729
Lisa and I used to daydream
about becoming famous,

14:52.729 --> 14:54.739
getting out of here, you know?

14:55.198 --> 14:59.030
Well, I guess she is
famous now, kind of.

14:59.030 --> 15:01.297
We've only spoken once
since she's been to the city.

15:01.297 --> 15:02.953
We're both so busy.
Thank you.

15:02.953 --> 15:04.496
Do you know where she's living now?

15:04.496 --> 15:07.138
Only that she found
the place on craigslist,

15:07.138 --> 15:11.592
"a furnished sublet,
perfect love nest for young couple."

15:11.592 --> 15:14.199
"Perfect love nest for young couple"?

15:14.199 --> 15:15.845
Those were the exact words?

15:15.845 --> 15:16.855
Yeah.

15:16.855 --> 15:19.945
She liked thinking of her
and Holden as a young couple.

15:19.945 --> 15:21.580
I gotta get him to my mom's.

15:21.580 --> 15:22.922
I'm gonna be late
for my shift at the diner.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.351
- Can you let yourselves out?
- Sure, sure.

15:30.698 --> 15:32.821
If I was Lisa,

15:32.821 --> 15:34.888
I'd run away too.

15:39.092 --> 15:41.203
This girl grew up
in the middle of nowhere

15:41.203 --> 15:43.339
with two people old enough
to be her grandparents.

15:43.339 --> 15:46.310
She was sheltered to
the point of being smothered.

15:46.310 --> 15:49.684
Weeping Willow was her way
of busting out of that world.

15:49.684 --> 15:53.255
She can't find a better way to make
a splash than to stage a kidnapping?

15:53.255 --> 15:55.854
Hey, a witness just came forward.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.809
Do not sent your money
to weeping Willow 17.

15:59.809 --> 16:02.756
She's a scam artist, a faker.

16:02.756 --> 16:04.853
Willow and Holden are thieves.

16:04.853 --> 16:09.376
I scripted a cyber-kidnapping
video drama right here, two years ago

16:09.376 --> 16:11.246
at the New York film academy.

16:11.246 --> 16:13.394
Holden was a classmate of mine!

16:13.394 --> 16:14.756
He blatantly ripped me off.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.894
I want the whole world
to know the truth.

16:17.178 --> 16:18.555
This guy's foaming at the mouth.

16:18.555 --> 16:19.975
Ira, track this guy down.

16:19.975 --> 16:22.095
We need to see what he can tell
us about Holden's whereabouts.

16:22.095 --> 16:25.336
This will help.
I've got a hit on the craigslist ad.

16:25.336 --> 16:26.943
For the love nest?

16:26.943 --> 16:29.781
I dipped into a cache of old
postings from last spring,

16:29.781 --> 16:30.726
and then here it is.

16:30.726 --> 16:33.142
"Furnished sublet, perfect love nest
for young couple"

16:33.142 --> 16:36.562
Detective Logan was right on,
it's in Clinton village.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.250
You should be happy.
You may finally have a crime scene.

16:39.250 --> 16:41.045
- Can't wait.
- I bet when we get there,

16:41.045 --> 16:43.771
they'll be watching TV
and laughing at us.

16:54.962 --> 16:58.593
Doesn't look like they expected
to be gone for very long.

16:59.202 --> 17:01.458
So Willow filmed the videos here.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.904
The laptop must have been there.

17:09.901 --> 17:11.626
These glasses.

17:11.626 --> 17:13.809
Holden wore them in the video logs.

17:13.809 --> 17:16.535
Let's get back to this blood, huh?
There's a lot of it,

17:16.535 --> 17:19.339
and they got footprints going
right out into the hallway.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.931
These guys must watch
a lot of forensic TV.

17:21.931 --> 17:24.411
Very elaborate staging.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.989
Is it?

17:27.281 --> 17:30.435
Wheeler, you've been
skeptical from the get.

17:30.435 --> 17:31.612
Now you think this is real?

17:31.612 --> 17:33.992
This was Willow's love nest.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.569
I don't think she'd want it
trashed that way.

17:38.189 --> 17:41.011
There were security cameras
in the elevator.

17:42.893 --> 17:45.954
Okay, out of context,
this looks real.

17:45.954 --> 17:48.289
In context, they knew
they were being videotaped,

17:48.289 --> 17:50.911
so they stay in character
till they get out the door.

17:50.911 --> 17:53.276
Wheeler said the door looked
like it had been knocked in.

17:53.276 --> 17:55.965
In that building, all the doors
looked like they've been knocked in.

17:55.965 --> 17:59.456
The blood at the scene
was human, type O.

17:59.456 --> 18:01.502
And CSU found broken fingernails

18:01.502 --> 18:04.974
and what looks like Willow's
hair torn from the root.

18:04.974 --> 18:07.855
No contact from the kidnappers
since yesterday.

18:07.855 --> 18:10.634
If this is real,
that's not a good sign.

18:10.634 --> 18:13.436
Well, if it is real, shouldn't
our next move be to contact them?

18:13.436 --> 18:16.584
We gave a press conference.
No response.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.616
Maybe that was the wrong medium.

18:22.112 --> 18:25.292
They might wanna negotiate
on their own turf.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.463
Right.

18:27.833 --> 18:30.275
So which one of you two
wants to go on camera?

18:30.275 --> 18:32.186
- Wheeler.
- Not me.

18:34.527 --> 18:35.983
No!

18:39.821 --> 18:41.344
Wheeler,

18:41.725 --> 18:45.373
your face now represents
the entire NYPD.

18:45.373 --> 18:47.156
Do what you can.

18:52.588 --> 18:54.990
Okay, Wheeler, uh,

18:54.990 --> 18:56.978
action.

18:57.154 --> 19:00.152
This is detective Megan Wheeler
of the NYPD.

19:00.152 --> 19:02.621
I am posting a message to
the individuals responsible

19:02.621 --> 19:06.241
for the Willow/Holden kidnapping
videos here on youlenz.

19:06.241 --> 19:09.969
The Major case squad has devoted
valuable resources to this case

19:09.969 --> 19:13.796
in the belief that it may be
an actual hostage situation.

19:13.796 --> 19:15.462
If this is the case,

19:15.462 --> 19:18.139
I appeal to the kidnappers to contact us

19:18.139 --> 19:20.982
so that we can negotiate
a peaceful end to the situation.

19:20.982 --> 19:22.679
Nobody needs to get hurt.

19:22.679 --> 19:24.810
If this is an elaborate hoax,

19:24.810 --> 19:26.556
it's gone too far.

19:31.010 --> 19:34.008
Bob, this is detective Megan Wheeler
returning your call.

19:34.008 --> 19:37.182
Please call me back when you
get the message. Thank you.

19:37.182 --> 19:38.518
Welcome to your 15 minutes.

19:38.518 --> 19:41.209
- 5,000 hits on your vlog already.
- Terrific.

19:41.209 --> 19:44.651
Hey! The kidnappers
just posted their response.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.898
I appeal, I appeal, I appeal
I appeal, I appeal to the kidnappers.

19:47.898 --> 19:49.565
I appeal to the kidnappers
to contact,

19:49.565 --> 19:51.662
I appeal to the kidnappers
to contact us.

19:51.662 --> 19:52.849
...contact us.

19:52.849 --> 19:54.133
Nobody needs to get hurt.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.032
Get hurt. Get hurt.
Get, get, get hurt.

19:56.032 --> 20:00.031
I know some of you online
are still saying this is a fake,

20:00.031 --> 20:01.793
but it's real.

20:01.793 --> 20:04.763
I'm telling you this is
actually happening to us.

20:04.763 --> 20:06.692
You're not showing us respect.

20:06.692 --> 20:13.030
22,158 hits is not enough
to keep Willow and Holden alive.

20:13.662 --> 20:16.271
After that, bang, bang.

20:16.271 --> 20:17.937
Weep for Willow.

20:17.937 --> 20:19.937
And detective Megan Wheeler?

20:19.937 --> 20:22.811
If you still don't believe us...

20:26.338 --> 20:27.438
Oh, my god.

20:27.438 --> 20:28.457
Believe them.

20:28.457 --> 20:30.307
Please, believe them.

20:36.913 --> 20:38.355
Oh, my god.

20:39.153 --> 20:40.927
Oh, my god.

20:50.547 --> 20:52.728
I'm telling you,
the whole story is staged.

20:52.728 --> 20:55.031
He stole the whole damn thing from me.

20:55.265 --> 20:56.824
It's all in my script.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.756
You always carry
this thing around with you?

20:59.756 --> 21:00.942
Just read it.

21:00.942 --> 21:04.640
The two kidnappers, the boyfriend,
the girlfriend, the internet ransom.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.844
Every good kidnapping story
has a ransom and a romantic couple.

21:07.844 --> 21:09.672
There's nothing original about that.

21:09.672 --> 21:11.454
Okay, more proof it's a scam?

21:11.454 --> 21:12.719
The title.

21:12.719 --> 21:15.224
Weeping Willow. I liked it.

21:15.224 --> 21:16.616
He stole that too.

21:16.616 --> 21:18.832
Mine was "rescuing Rita."

21:18.832 --> 21:20.530
Same thing.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.827
His is "weeping Willow 17."

21:22.827 --> 21:25.155
He registered that name
three months ago.

21:25.155 --> 21:26.667
What more proof do you need?

21:26.667 --> 21:29.460
So you were in film school with Holden.

21:29.681 --> 21:31.485
Were you two friends?

21:31.485 --> 21:32.536
Friends?

21:32.536 --> 21:33.858
He worked for me.

21:33.858 --> 21:36.891
He was a gaffer on my film.
Freshman year.

21:36.891 --> 21:39.820
You have the thing about
the severed ear in here?

21:39.820 --> 21:41.236
No.

21:41.236 --> 21:43.049
So he did have some ideas of his own.

21:43.049 --> 21:45.238
More like he ripped off Tarantino.

21:45.238 --> 21:47.345
That was before her time.

21:47.766 --> 21:50.789
You know what?
That ear thing, totally bogus.

21:50.789 --> 21:53.154
It seemed very convincing to me.

21:53.481 --> 21:55.978
Do you know how easy
that is to fake?

21:56.266 --> 21:57.869
We're about to find out.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.367
We received an ear in the morning mail.

22:06.609 --> 22:09.117
With a note for you, Wheeler.

22:10.369 --> 22:12.015
That makes me feel great.

22:12.015 --> 22:13.924
You were expecting flowers?

22:13.924 --> 22:16.245
Can you tell if it comes
from someone who's alive?

22:16.245 --> 22:18.701
It's not from a cadaver, yet.

22:18.701 --> 22:20.453
It's a healthy male ear,

22:20.453 --> 22:23.213
maybe someone in their 20s.

22:25.839 --> 22:27.309
What else can you tell us?

22:27.309 --> 22:30.055
Same blood as the blood
you found at their apartment.

22:30.055 --> 22:31.195
Blood loss?

22:31.195 --> 22:32.701
It would be significant.

22:32.701 --> 22:33.847
Enough to kill him?

22:33.847 --> 22:35.869
Not if pressure was applied.
Logan.

22:35.869 --> 22:37.094
Huh?

22:40.848 --> 22:42.228
All right, the ear is real.

22:42.228 --> 22:44.234
Doesn't mean the kidnapping is.

22:44.234 --> 22:46.108
That's a desperate move for a hoax.

22:46.108 --> 22:47.568
These days, that's the way it is.

22:47.568 --> 22:49.226
People do anything to be famous.

22:49.226 --> 22:50.190
Or rich.

22:50.190 --> 22:51.690
200,000 downloads so far.

22:51.690 --> 22:53.925
Almost half a million dollars in four days.

22:53.925 --> 22:55.315
Detectives, good news.

22:55.315 --> 22:56.632
Holden tried to cover it up,

22:56.632 --> 22:59.420
but I think I picked up his cyber trail.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.950
Lead the way.

23:07.848 --> 23:11.273
It turns out Holden secretly registered
weeping Willow 17

23:11.273 --> 23:13.332
as a domain name months ago.

23:13.332 --> 23:19.786
Same account, he also opened a virtual
production office online for scripts, casting.

23:19.786 --> 23:23.337
30 wannabes responded to the posting
for "thuggy kidnappers."

23:23.337 --> 23:24.822
I printed out the head shots.

23:24.822 --> 23:27.875
All right, so let's watch the video,
see if we recognize anyone,

23:27.875 --> 23:30.054
maybe from their build.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.185
All right, freeze that.

23:34.443 --> 23:37.776
That guy's arm,
some kind of a tattoo.

23:37.776 --> 23:39.824
Looks like a snake.

23:41.247 --> 23:45.026
This looks like the same tat.
"Reggie Luckman."

23:48.617 --> 23:51.264
- But it's not a snake.
- What is it?

23:51.264 --> 23:53.042
It's a ribbon of film.

23:58.997 --> 24:00.207
Gotcha.

24:01.443 --> 24:04.495
He used to live here. No more.

24:04.936 --> 24:07.089
That's not what Reggie's
parole officer told us.

24:07.089 --> 24:08.605
Yeah, well, you know parole.

24:08.605 --> 24:11.504
They like to have an address
that shows stability.

24:11.504 --> 24:13.875
Oh, they sure do.

24:15.977 --> 24:19.145
Well, this is definitely a man's shirt.

24:19.618 --> 24:21.452
When's the last time you saw him?

24:21.452 --> 24:22.461
I don't know.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.327
Do we really have to go
through this drill?

24:25.507 --> 24:28.894
The one where I search this place
and find some drugs or I plant them,

24:28.894 --> 24:30.801
and either way, you come downtown,

24:30.801 --> 24:32.267
you get back in the system,

24:32.267 --> 24:35.275
and that's all for a schmuck
who left you?

24:40.829 --> 24:42.240
Did you have a fight?

24:42.240 --> 24:44.777
No! Did Reggie do something wrong?

24:44.777 --> 24:46.067
We just want to talk to him.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.692
He's not hurt, is he?

24:47.692 --> 24:49.950
You guys broke up, but you
still wanna protect him?

24:49.950 --> 24:52.470
I didn't say we broke up.
He left.

24:52.470 --> 24:54.346
He said he had a job.

24:54.346 --> 24:55.492
Did he mention where?

24:55.492 --> 24:58.868
He's an actor, you know?
He said he had an acting gig.

25:01.862 --> 25:05.448
That was four days ago.
He hasn't been home since.

25:06.529 --> 25:09.203
You don't think
he's on a film shoot?

25:10.868 --> 25:13.375
I'm not stupid.

25:17.042 --> 25:20.167
The gun I wasn't
supposed to know about?

25:20.365 --> 25:22.368
He took that with him.

25:25.529 --> 25:27.630
Well, looks like Reggie's
a small time felon

25:27.630 --> 25:31.674
who brought his own gun
to the set and hacked off Holden's ear.

25:34.060 --> 25:37.175
New theory, hoax gone bad.

25:37.622 --> 25:40.129
This kid Holden's lost control of the set.

25:45.975 --> 25:47.850
Okay. Okay.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.545
Things have gotten out of hand.

25:49.545 --> 25:51.744
It's like so out of control.

25:51.744 --> 25:54.002
This isn't my story anymore.

25:54.002 --> 25:56.467
I'm afraid these guys
really want to kill us.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.134
Willow and I, we need help.

25:58.134 --> 26:01.586
We're in the basement
of 735 West 130th street.

26:01.586 --> 26:03.680
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need the police to come get us!

26:03.680 --> 26:05.969
Come quick before someone gets hurt!

26:05.969 --> 26:08.162
735 West 130!

26:22.027 --> 26:23.526
Come on, man.

26:23.734 --> 26:25.600
We can work this out.

26:29.426 --> 26:30.790
Will...

26:32.119 --> 26:33.735
Holden?

26:35.864 --> 26:38.160
Willow?

26:39.117 --> 26:40.513
Holden?

26:46.075 --> 26:48.565
And, uh, that's real.

26:49.962 --> 26:51.860
Why don't you tell us what's not?

26:51.860 --> 26:54.826
I told you everything else.

26:55.945 --> 26:57.713
Willow and I were filming a vlog

26:57.713 --> 27:01.343
when these two psychos
burst into our apartment.

27:02.109 --> 27:03.800
Is this the other guy?

27:03.800 --> 27:05.066
Yeah, that's him.

27:05.066 --> 27:06.147
Nice work.

27:06.147 --> 27:07.376
Awkward, though,

27:07.376 --> 27:10.852
'cause we found Reggie's
head shot on your VPO.

27:10.852 --> 27:12.381
Okay, I left that out.

27:12.381 --> 27:16.384
I thought it would confuse your
understanding of the storyline.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.626
Yeah, anyway, none of that matters.

27:18.626 --> 27:21.521
You wanna tell that
to the guy you shot dead?

27:22.253 --> 27:24.027
I didn't shoot him.

27:26.530 --> 27:28.413
We saw the video.

27:28.413 --> 27:29.970
Oh, I mean I shot him,

27:29.970 --> 27:31.972
but that was fake.

27:31.972 --> 27:34.463
I had a prop gun.
He was wearing a squib.

27:34.463 --> 27:37.948
It's like a fake blood bag.

27:38.617 --> 27:42.486
Reggie shot Todd afterwards for real

27:42.486 --> 27:44.463
when the webcam was off.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.897
They got in a fight about the money.

27:47.155 --> 27:48.630
Okay.

27:49.596 --> 27:51.699
Start from the top.

27:54.284 --> 27:56.615
Okay, I hired Reggie.

27:56.615 --> 28:00.103
We were making a serialized vlog
about a kidnapping,

28:00.103 --> 28:03.763
but the guy turned out to be
a real psycho!

28:03.763 --> 28:05.718
I mean, when he cut my ear off,

28:05.718 --> 28:09.652
afterwards he was just smiling
like he had done a really good take.

28:09.652 --> 28:10.937
Why didn't you end the shoot?

28:10.937 --> 28:12.138
I tried.

28:12.138 --> 28:13.536
He was obsessed.

28:13.536 --> 28:15.244
When the camera shut off,

28:15.244 --> 28:18.937
he pulls his own gun out
and says, "nobody leaves!"

28:18.937 --> 28:22.536
Okay. So now you're saying
that he held you hostage.

28:22.739 --> 28:24.070
Did he make any demands?

28:24.070 --> 28:25.921
Pages.

28:26.325 --> 28:28.562
More lines, more action.

28:28.562 --> 28:31.688
It was supposed to end
with me tricking the bad guys,

28:31.688 --> 28:34.252
overpowering them,
and rescuing Willow.

28:34.252 --> 28:36.074
He wanted a different ending.

28:36.074 --> 28:37.814
Something more believable?

28:37.814 --> 28:39.371
Whatever.

28:39.572 --> 28:44.556
That is when I wrote this last scene
where I've broken free

28:44.556 --> 28:47.210
and I'm asking the viewers
to call the cops.

28:47.210 --> 28:50.452
You know, Todd bursts in,
we struggle, gun goes off,

28:50.452 --> 28:52.365
Reggie comes in, shoots me,

28:52.365 --> 28:54.303
takes Willow.

28:55.096 --> 28:57.358
Yeah, we saw all that.

28:57.358 --> 28:59.441
It, it came out okay?

29:01.662 --> 29:04.691
We finished the take.

29:04.691 --> 29:07.757
Reggie realized I gave the actual address
of where we're being held.

29:07.757 --> 29:09.036
He goes ballistic,

29:09.036 --> 29:11.700
'cause now he's not only
obsessed with the part,

29:11.700 --> 29:13.387
now he wants all the money.

29:13.387 --> 29:16.481
Todd and he go at it,
he shoots him.

29:16.802 --> 29:19.443
Point blank in the gut.

29:20.529 --> 29:22.653
He grabs Willow and bolts.

29:22.653 --> 29:24.690
Why didn't he shoot you?

29:24.832 --> 29:26.558
I don't know.

29:28.115 --> 29:30.549
Oh, my god. Willow!

29:30.549 --> 29:32.152
Oh, you've gotta find them.

29:32.152 --> 29:33.679
Reggie's obsessed with her.

29:33.679 --> 29:35.760
We're having a hard time
judging what's real here.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.063
Okay, here's what's real.

29:37.063 --> 29:39.118
This guy is insane.

29:39.118 --> 29:40.445
He's insane.

29:40.874 --> 29:42.277
He's insane.

29:52.479 --> 29:53.598
Please.

29:53.598 --> 29:57.286
Please, he's gonna shoot me.
He shot everybody else.

29:57.286 --> 29:59.232
Please help me.

30:00.460 --> 30:02.103
It's streaming, live.

30:02.103 --> 30:04.810
- Where are they now?
- We don't know.

30:04.810 --> 30:06.876
What is that wall behind her?

30:06.876 --> 30:09.226
White, looks metallic.

30:09.226 --> 30:11.348
Could be the inside of a van.

30:11.348 --> 30:13.818
It may be Reggie doesn't
know how to encrypt.

30:13.818 --> 30:15.720
He's uploading by Wi-Fi.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.887
Inside the van?

30:16.887 --> 30:19.570
When you drive around New York,
you can cadge a signal.

30:19.834 --> 30:21.381
Uh, got it.

30:21.381 --> 30:23.958
Union square, public server.
They're still logged in.

30:23.958 --> 30:24.719
Go.

30:24.719 --> 30:27.229
Union square!
Let's go! Move it!

31:07.787 --> 31:09.643
Does that guy look right to you?

31:20.531 --> 31:22.887
Sir, stop right there.

31:23.245 --> 31:25.778
I'm gonna ask you
to take that hat off.

31:27.530 --> 31:29.553
Take off your hat!

31:30.227 --> 31:32.126
Show's over, Reggie.

31:32.612 --> 31:34.280
All right, now kiss that van!

31:34.280 --> 31:36.383
Go on, get over there.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.391
Oh, thank god!

31:43.391 --> 31:44.891
It's the police!

31:46.964 --> 31:48.306
Give me that camera.

31:51.452 --> 31:54.053
Hey, man, I'm just an actor.

31:55.167 --> 31:58.976
With a real gun and a kidnapped girl
in the back of your van.

31:58.976 --> 32:00.619
Did Willow say I kidnapped her?

32:00.619 --> 32:03.002
We have you on tape, James Dean,

32:03.002 --> 32:04.326
with a gun to her head.

32:04.326 --> 32:06.315
I have it in my script.

32:06.965 --> 32:08.222
Here.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.205
Here's my sides.

32:11.532 --> 32:13.061
We shot the double murder scene.

32:13.061 --> 32:15.492
I grab Willow, get in the van.

32:15.492 --> 32:17.361
It's all there.

32:18.211 --> 32:20.557
Holden told us you forced
him to write this.

32:20.557 --> 32:22.686
Well, yeah, in a way.

32:23.659 --> 32:25.258
He was kind of afraid of me.

32:25.258 --> 32:27.715
Of you? Really.

32:29.346 --> 32:31.058
How about Willow?
Was Willow afraid of you?

32:31.058 --> 32:32.285
Me?

32:33.313 --> 32:34.654
No.

32:35.467 --> 32:37.625
Willow just wanted a bigger part.

32:37.625 --> 32:41.074
She said if she asked,
Holden would blow her off.

32:41.074 --> 32:43.745
The entire shoot,
she had good ideas.

32:43.745 --> 32:45.989
Really good at improvs.

32:46.488 --> 32:47.734
Holden never listened to her.

32:47.734 --> 32:50.418
This whole van scene,
runway thing, that was hers.

32:50.418 --> 32:54.892
She wanted an emotional scene,
just her in the van.

32:56.523 --> 32:58.844
I, um...

32:58.844 --> 33:01.028
talked Holden into it.

33:01.259 --> 33:03.344
You talked him into it?

33:10.588 --> 33:12.809
Let's go back to your gun.

33:14.061 --> 33:15.914
Get me a lawyer.

33:17.039 --> 33:20.749
I was blindfolded
when they did the shootout.

33:21.021 --> 33:24.374
Reggie said the shootout was your idea.

33:24.576 --> 33:27.535
Well, I mean, that's sweet,
but it was a collaboration.

33:27.535 --> 33:28.653
Sweet?

33:28.653 --> 33:31.450
Didn't he chop off Holden's ear?

33:31.669 --> 33:34.506
God, that was scary.

33:34.506 --> 33:37.118
Reggie just completely went insane.

33:37.118 --> 33:39.779
And Holden at first
was ready to end it,

33:39.779 --> 33:41.392
but then he was like,

33:41.392 --> 33:45.442
"no, you know, we really have
something here. Let's keep going."

33:45.442 --> 33:50.939
Okay, we need to know
what happened after the shootout.

33:54.645 --> 33:58.913
Reggie and I left to do the van scene.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.242
And everyone was okay?

34:01.242 --> 34:03.690
I was blindfolded
when they took me out.

34:03.690 --> 34:06.316
And then I went into the van
and touched up my makeup,

34:06.316 --> 34:09.713
and then Reggie came out
and we drove off.

34:09.713 --> 34:12.176
I'm, I'm really sorry you guys
were dragged into this.

34:12.176 --> 34:16.246
None of us had any idea it would
ever catch on the way it did.

34:16.246 --> 34:18.135
I just...

34:18.135 --> 34:21.514
I can't wait for Holden
to finish it, you know?

34:21.514 --> 34:25.076
I think he's gonna
deliver something amazing.

34:26.331 --> 34:30.870
Willow, this isn't community theater.
You're involved in a crime.

34:32.056 --> 34:34.417
It was, it was a performance.

34:34.417 --> 34:36.898
It's not like anybody got hurt.

34:37.416 --> 34:40.117
Yeah, who cares about
the character actor, right?

34:40.554 --> 34:42.226
Todd?

34:45.036 --> 34:47.690
What? Why, what happened?

34:47.690 --> 34:50.538
I mean, did he get
a stomachache from the squib?

34:52.051 --> 34:54.054
It's cyber-Rashomon.

34:54.054 --> 34:55.985
Reggie says Holden shot Todd,

34:55.985 --> 34:58.376
Holden says Reggie did it,

34:58.376 --> 35:00.742
and Willow doesn't even
believe anyone's dead.

35:00.742 --> 35:02.897
Or she's pretending not to.

35:03.115 --> 35:07.965
I think the guy with the gun became
sexier than the guy getting beat up.

35:08.227 --> 35:10.611
They partnered up to get the money.

35:13.417 --> 35:15.445
Ballistics,

35:15.445 --> 35:19.443
the gun we saw Holden shoot Todd

35:19.443 --> 35:22.666
with is a prop gun with blanks.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.995
They're checking Reggie's gun now.

35:24.995 --> 35:28.520
That means Todd was killed
when the camera was off.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.975
She's protecting someone.

35:32.087 --> 35:36.071
She wants us to believe she
only knows what's in the script.

35:36.071 --> 35:39.879
I'd like to see just how good
an actress she really is.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.805
Is, is he really dead?

35:50.805 --> 35:52.333
You wanna be sure?

35:52.333 --> 35:55.501
No, no, no, no, I...

35:56.658 --> 35:58.795
I don't understand.

35:59.524 --> 36:03.247
It was staged,
just like everything else.

36:03.247 --> 36:05.836
Did you see Reggie shoot Todd?

36:06.033 --> 36:07.303
No.

36:07.303 --> 36:10.146
I was in the van
putting on my makeup.

36:10.921 --> 36:15.694
Maybe Reggie told you
that he shot Todd.

36:15.694 --> 36:17.327
I...

36:17.327 --> 36:19.053
All I know is that...

36:19.053 --> 36:22.287
we weren't getting paid
much, and, um,

36:22.287 --> 36:25.200
the guys decided to ask Holden
for a share of the profits,

36:25.200 --> 36:27.404
and Holden said no.

36:27.404 --> 36:29.926
And then Reggie came up with
some sort of scheme

36:29.926 --> 36:33.137
to freak him out into
giving up the account numbers.

36:36.833 --> 36:39.201
I guess something went wrong.

36:39.797 --> 36:43.417
But Reggie left out part of the story.

36:43.417 --> 36:44.998
What?

36:52.347 --> 36:53.543
No!

36:53.543 --> 36:56.166
No! That, that's impossible!

36:56.166 --> 36:57.183
How?

36:57.183 --> 37:00.406
After he got the account numbers,
Reggie shot Holden.

37:00.406 --> 37:02.884
No. / He didn't tell you 'cause he knew
you wouldn't leave with him.

37:02.884 --> 37:04.854
No one was supposed to die.

37:04.854 --> 37:06.504
I just, this was,

37:06.504 --> 37:07.992
this was my big thing.

37:07.992 --> 37:11.192
I was supposed to be a star,
just for people to know my name.

37:11.192 --> 37:12.862
He can't die, he's not dead!

37:12.862 --> 37:14.136
It's not true!

37:14.136 --> 37:16.005
Baby! Baby!

37:16.005 --> 37:18.382
Oh, please, you don't understand!

37:18.382 --> 37:20.336
Baby, please wake up!

37:20.336 --> 37:21.636
No!

37:21.636 --> 37:23.261
Oh, my god!

37:24.416 --> 37:26.534
She still loves me.

37:29.564 --> 37:31.054
Logan.

37:33.146 --> 37:34.863
Stay here.

37:41.942 --> 37:43.512
Rodgers?

37:45.020 --> 37:49.979
Todd's death may not be
what it seemed to be.

37:50.132 --> 37:51.335
He's dead, right?

37:51.335 --> 37:52.551
Yeah, he is.

37:52.551 --> 37:55.122
But this is what killed him.

37:58.498 --> 38:00.549
That's not a slug.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.900
It's just the wadding.

38:03.203 --> 38:05.666
There was no bullet.

38:05.666 --> 38:08.355
He was killed by a blank.

38:11.761 --> 38:13.847
Look, I only pretended to shoot Todd.

38:13.847 --> 38:16.150
He was in on it.
I squibbed him.

38:16.150 --> 38:17.796
We planned the whole thing out together.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.685
And Willow, was she in on it?

38:19.685 --> 38:20.731
No.

38:21.312 --> 38:22.701
No.

38:22.701 --> 38:23.817
Who loaded the blanks?

38:23.817 --> 38:26.554
I did. Holden was too cheap
to hire a real prop guy.

38:26.554 --> 38:29.291
And why did you do this?

38:30.719 --> 38:34.780
To scare Holden into
giving up his account numbers?

38:36.181 --> 38:38.376
He was stiffing me and Todd.

38:38.376 --> 38:40.625
The guy was getting like
half a million, and we had no cut?

38:40.625 --> 38:42.668
Try a million.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.436
And he gets the last laugh.

38:44.436 --> 38:45.889
He's cooperating with the DA.

38:45.889 --> 38:47.405
He's never made any threats.

38:47.405 --> 38:49.116
They don't even have an extortion case.

38:49.116 --> 38:51.026
This whole thing,
it wasn't even my idea!

38:51.026 --> 38:52.881
It was Holden's!

38:52.881 --> 38:54.127
Oh, but I'm the ex-con.

38:54.127 --> 38:55.589
The DA figures
let me take the fall.

38:55.589 --> 38:57.457
That seem fair to you?

38:57.457 --> 39:01.491
Well, actually, I'd say Todd's the one
who has the bad deal here.

39:01.794 --> 39:04.790
The wadding from the blank
hit an artery.

39:04.790 --> 39:06.861
He bled out.

39:07.498 --> 39:09.094
What do you mean?

39:12.806 --> 39:14.606
What?

39:15.860 --> 39:18.494
I actually killed somebody?

39:19.088 --> 39:22.624
Yeah. You actually did.

39:22.624 --> 39:26.522
And you're looking at
a manslaughter charge.

39:30.121 --> 39:31.559
Oh, my god.

39:36.247 --> 39:38.411
Does Willow know?

39:44.497 --> 39:46.997
Willow, you're not
gonna believe this, okay?

39:46.997 --> 39:48.972
Our lawyers lied.

39:49.254 --> 39:52.228
The police must have seized the account.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.698
What are you talking about?

39:54.698 --> 39:57.137
The digipay account, Willow.

39:57.358 --> 39:58.861
It's empty.

39:58.861 --> 40:02.341
It, it's a million dollars, gone.

40:02.535 --> 40:05.123
It was never about the money, Holden.

40:05.495 --> 40:07.699
Yes, it was.

40:16.857 --> 40:18.989
Where are you,
where are you going?

40:21.095 --> 40:23.894
I have somewhere I need to be.

40:25.164 --> 40:27.039
No, but...

40:27.392 --> 40:30.238
but I heard you crying.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.322
Will, you love me.

40:38.622 --> 40:40.414
I do.

40:41.341 --> 40:43.614
And I always will.

40:59.509 --> 41:04.542
We're back live with the internet phenomenon
known as weeping Willow 17,

41:04.542 --> 41:06.384
Lisa Willow Tyler.

41:06.384 --> 41:11.051
Lisa, are you over the trauma
of the death of your fellow cast member?

41:11.051 --> 41:12.285
Well, you know, Larry,

41:12.285 --> 41:14.974
I actually didn't get to know
Todd that well,

41:14.974 --> 41:18.451
but he was a really,
really sweet guy, and it's just tragic,

41:18.451 --> 41:21.674
'cause he had such a great
career ahead of him.

41:21.674 --> 41:23.906
But right now I'm
just trying to move on.

41:23.906 --> 41:25.462
What's next for you?

41:25.462 --> 41:28.757
Well, I can't even tell you
how excited I am

41:28.757 --> 41:33.444
to say that I finally secured financing
for a full-length weeping Willow feature

41:33.444 --> 41:37.922
and that we are going to being production
at the end of the summer in Toronto.

41:37.922 --> 41:38.830
Tell me about it.

41:38.830 --> 41:43.259
Well, I basically play a girl from
a small town who is kidnapped

41:43.259 --> 41:47.777
and she has to do whatever
it takes in order to escape.

41:52.389 --> 41:54.811
Boy, she had me fooled.

41:55.844 --> 41:58.255
She had us all fooled.

41:58.603 --> 42:00.863
Don't worry about it.

42:00.863 --> 42:04.099
Let's get something to eat.
I'm buying.
