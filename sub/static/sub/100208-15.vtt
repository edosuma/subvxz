11:24.205 --> 11:25.902
that's a baller move.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.425
Oh, no, this is, um... Yes.

11:27.469 --> 11:29.210
I'm Mr. Marvin's
assistant.

11:29.253 --> 11:33.040
Okay, so you're thinking of
absorbing Hudson Enterprises?

11:33.083 --> 11:34.955
OWEN:
I can rely on you to be discreet?

11:34.998 --> 11:36.521
Bro. Totally.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.393
Hudsy and I were
in the stew together.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.917
That's what we called
our dorm at Eddings Hall.

11:40.961 --> 11:43.746
Uh, my, uh, assistant
has some questions.

11:43.790 --> 11:44.921
Love it.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.923
So, we're looking
deep background.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.360
Uh, we just want to make sure
that Mr. Hudson

11:49.404 --> 11:51.362
doesn't have any skeletons
in the closet,

11:51.406 --> 11:52.929
especially in this day and age.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.626
And especially
when it comes to women.

11:54.670 --> 11:55.802
Yeah. Hey,

11:55.845 --> 11:56.846
I get it.
[chuckles]

11:56.890 --> 11:58.718
M-Me, too, my friends, right?

11:58.761 --> 11:59.719
I mean...

11:59.762 --> 12:00.937
hey, me three.

12:00.981 --> 12:03.157
Right. So,

12:03.200 --> 12:06.421
was Ryan a long-term
relationship kind of guy

12:06.464 --> 12:07.988
or did he play the field?

12:08.031 --> 12:10.164
He was definitely a ladies' man.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.122
Though we did lose him
to one serious

12:12.166 --> 12:14.124
long-distance girlfriend
for a while.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.605
Oh. That would be, um...

12:16.648 --> 12:17.911
Lucy Sable?

12:17.954 --> 12:19.477
Yeah, that's right.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.349
Wow. Thorough.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.960
Did you ever get
the chance to meet her?

12:24.004 --> 12:26.746
Not officially,
but she did come to campus once.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.836
Her and... her and Ryan had this
big blowout behind the dorm.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.839
And when he came back
to the room, Ryan was a mess.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.231
Said she dumped him.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.234
Didn't even give him a reason.

12:37.278 --> 12:40.455
Do you remember Ryan ever going

12:40.498 --> 12:44.111
to meet Lucy
sometime in August of 2000?

12:44.154 --> 12:45.852
Uh, yeah.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.332
Actually,
I remember that very well.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.595
He snuck off campus
for a few hours

12:50.639 --> 12:54.034
and got totally busted
sneaking back onto campus.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.645
Was Ryan gone long
enough to get to Maine?

12:56.688 --> 12:57.864
Maybe.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.517
All I know is,

12:59.561 --> 13:01.476
when campus police
brought him back to the dorm,

13:01.519 --> 13:04.566
they busted a few of my buddies
and I with a bottle of vodka.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.698
I got suspended for two weeks.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.093
Did you ever talk
to her personally?

13:10.137 --> 13:11.747
Uh, once. Yeah.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.314
After they broke up.

13:13.357 --> 13:16.012
Uh, s-she called the
dorm looking for Ryan.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.928
She wanted
his school e-mail address.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.235
Well, call me
a hopeless romantic,

13:21.278 --> 13:23.063
'cause I gave it to her.

13:23.106 --> 13:26.849
And, you know,
'cause I'm for women.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.851
That's very clear.

13:31.071 --> 13:34.422
ACE:
I hacked into the St. Louis
City police department,

13:34.465 --> 13:37.425
got the case file
for the Missouri poisoning.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.035
Here are some
crime scene photos.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.515
They're gross, but...

13:40.558 --> 13:42.125
You know, those don't look
like natural deaths.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.998
Mm-mm. No, Claire's poison
didn't do that.

13:45.041 --> 13:48.001
She prided herself
on creating perfect victims.

13:48.044 --> 13:51.352
And she's a chemistry teacher.
Clearly very skilled.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.310
She must've refined the poison,

13:53.354 --> 13:55.922
make sure victims' bodies
don't get contorted.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.663
So, if Tiffany died
like Claire's victims,

13:58.707 --> 14:00.883
Josh must have used
that same poison.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.885
Right?
Right.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.800
Yeah, but how'd he get it?

14:09.413 --> 14:11.372
What do you think that means?

14:14.723 --> 14:16.377
Uh, q-question.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.118
What does this mean?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.960
Dad, the, uh, the poison
that was found at the scene

14:34.003 --> 14:35.396
of Liza Ainsley's death.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.050
How much was left?

14:38.834 --> 14:42.620
Joshua and Claire, they n...
they never crossed paths.

14:42.664 --> 14:46.886
But what if he got a hold
of her poison somewhere else?

14:48.975 --> 14:52.413
Right here, in this building.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.814
Okay. I have to admit,
that was kind of fun.

15:02.858 --> 15:06.383
Um, are you really gonna invest
in Chad's clinical trial?

15:06.427 --> 15:08.603
Uh, no.

15:08.646 --> 15:09.778
Definitely not.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.954
I got caught up in the moment.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.522
[chuckles]
You were very convincing.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.916
Eh, well, I've had
a lot of practice.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.874
[engine whirring]

15:24.140 --> 15:26.708

15:32.888 --> 15:34.890

15:48.295 --> 15:49.905
[car door opens]

15:49.949 --> 15:51.472
Nancy?

15:51.515 --> 15:54.127
What happened?

16:01.699 --> 16:03.832
NANCY:
I've been having visions,

16:03.875 --> 16:05.790
and I think Lucy wants
me to find her bones.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.314
I'm sorry, what, now?

16:07.357 --> 16:10.665
Yeah, and that's not all.
In the last vision,

16:10.708 --> 16:12.884
her eyes were bleeding.
BESS: Wait, like

16:12.928 --> 16:14.277
when you call to the Aglaeca?

16:14.321 --> 16:16.018
I think so. Yes.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.541
Okay, so now you believe
in all this crap?

16:17.585 --> 16:19.717
Out of pure necessity alone.

16:19.761 --> 16:23.112
My dad is running out of time,
and I really need your help.

16:23.156 --> 16:26.246
Okay, so we call to the Aglaeca.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.769
Is this, like,
a normal thing for you guys?

16:27.812 --> 16:29.379
BESS: But today is
the only day we can do it.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.207
Right, George? Yeah, but it never works.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.209
Need I remind you guys,
I got a "D" in French?

16:33.253 --> 16:35.168
My call was not answered.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.518
Yeah, but maybe you
didn't know how to do it?

16:37.561 --> 16:39.346
Okay, we need a primary source.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.261
What, is there a section
in the local library

16:41.304 --> 16:42.871
with firsthand accounts
of evil spirits

16:42.914 --> 16:44.264
that haunt the ocean, Bess?

16:44.307 --> 16:48.050
Not the library, but
the Historical Society.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.357
Let's do it. Uh...

16:50.400 --> 16:52.185
I mean, it's not like we
have any customers today.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.100
You know, with a murderer
on the loose and all.

16:54.143 --> 16:57.407
Surprise, fugitives and manhunts
are kind of bad for business.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.974
[phone buzzing]
Just give us a second.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.584
Yeah.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.764
OWEN:
Uh, is everything okay?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.767
Yeah. Uh...

17:09.811 --> 17:11.987
Nick... Nick needs me
at the police station.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.380
He says it's really important.

17:13.423 --> 17:15.164
Um, I'm just gonna
tell Bess and George

17:15.208 --> 17:17.732
that they can
go ahead without me. Well, let me tell them.

17:17.775 --> 17:19.951
I've always wanted to check
out the Historical Society.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.301
Really?

17:21.344 --> 17:23.738
No. But it sounds
like you could use

17:23.781 --> 17:25.348
all the help you can get.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.221
Ask for Hannah Gruen.

17:28.264 --> 17:29.700
She's been there forever.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.963
She can point you
in the right direction.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.356
Hannah Gruen.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.879
GEORGE:
All right, Romeo.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.446
Let's get going.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.973
[door opens]

17:42.017 --> 17:43.627
NICK:
So,

17:43.671 --> 17:45.194
we did some digging,

17:45.238 --> 17:47.979
and there's no way that
Claire could've shared

17:48.023 --> 17:49.677
her poison supply with Josh.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.982
ACE:
But,

17:51.026 --> 17:52.506
when Liza Ainsley's body
was found,

17:52.549 --> 17:54.899
there was a vial of poison
at the crime scene.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.814
Which went to police evidence.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.077
ACE:
Yeah.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.252
So we checked the evidence log.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.601
There's nothing suspicious.

18:00.644 --> 18:03.647
Just in case,
we pulled the Ainsley file.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.956
See that asterisk?

18:07.999 --> 18:10.654
The refrigerator broke
down, the vial of poison

18:10.698 --> 18:12.656
was moved to another unit
until it could be repaired.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.571
That's a perfect opportunity
for someone

18:14.615 --> 18:16.704
to access the evidence
without having to sign for it.

18:16.747 --> 18:17.922
Did Joshua do the repair?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.402
NICK:
No.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.361
No. I-I checked the records,
and he didn't.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.667
So I called around to a couple
other local repair shops...

18:25.800 --> 18:27.367
...and found this.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.934
Northeast Island Repair.

18:29.978 --> 18:33.329
Yeah, they came round
and fixed the broken fridge

18:33.373 --> 18:36.115
a week before Tiffany died.

18:36.158 --> 18:39.727
This work order has
a signature on it.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.903
We need to get
into the evidence room.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.517
I can't help you with that.
You got to talk to the chief.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.823
Dad...
[stammers]

18:48.866 --> 18:50.781
Ace, it's o... it's okay.

18:50.825 --> 18:54.089
Thank you, for everything.
I appreciate it.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.662
Now, I know you're not
giving up that easy.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.577
And,

19:03.620 --> 19:07.233
um, there's one more thing.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.939
Hey. You know
Captain Thom, right?

19:17.982 --> 19:21.551
He needs some help with
files in the bullpen.

19:21.595 --> 19:22.770
Okay.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.815
Thank you.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.445
NANCY:
This is Claire Barnett's poison.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.142
The vial's full.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.974
How could Josh have gotten
the poison from here?

20:37.018 --> 20:38.976
The seal on this vial
is brand-new.

20:39.020 --> 20:42.632
There's no way that it's
from Liza's case 15 years ago.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.895
The original vial got
swapped out for a decoy.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.593
Nancy.

20:46.636 --> 20:49.291
Hey, Detective Hart.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.075
That's police evidence.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.078
Okay, everybody just be cool.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.341
This isn't Claire's poison.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.778
What? You're trespassing

20:57.821 --> 20:59.736
and... I saw your signature

20:59.780 --> 21:00.737
on the work order

21:00.781 --> 21:01.782
for the refrigerator repair.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.262
That's when I realized

21:03.305 --> 21:04.741
it was you who swapped out
the poisons.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.179
Because you don't have to take
AP Chem to know that,

21:08.223 --> 21:10.530
in a glass container,
the meniscus of a liquid

21:10.573 --> 21:13.010
containing poison,
like baneberry, curves downward,

21:13.054 --> 21:14.882
but this meniscus curves upward

21:14.925 --> 21:18.189
because it's just water, right?

21:18.233 --> 21:19.190
No, no, no!
Whoa!

21:19.234 --> 21:20.583
What are you...?

21:23.673 --> 21:24.935
You leave me no choice.

21:24.979 --> 21:26.328
I'm arresting you
for breaking and entering

21:26.372 --> 21:28.461
and trespassing. Do not let her do this.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.332
She's gonna get us out
of here and then destroy

21:30.376 --> 21:32.595
the vial and no one
will ever know the truth,

21:32.639 --> 21:35.250
Karen gave the poison to Josh.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.296
Yeah, they will.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.645
Hey! Ace!

21:38.688 --> 21:39.689
You okay?

21:42.126 --> 21:43.389
Just water.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.438
It's over, Karen.

21:58.186 --> 22:01.755
I didn't kill Tiffany.
Joshua did.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.844
You gave him the poison.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.716
That is accessory
to murder, Karen.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.589
Because I signed
a work order form?

22:09.632 --> 22:11.112
That's your proof?

22:11.155 --> 22:14.028
You confiscated all of
the electronics from J. Dodd's,

22:14.071 --> 22:15.725
including Nick's tablet.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.641
You thought by doing so,
you could get rid of this,

22:18.685 --> 22:20.556
but you forgot about the cloud.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.907
You didn't know
there was a camera

22:23.951 --> 22:26.040
when you went to
Joshua's last month.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.087
I'm not the only one
who reads lips.

22:30.131 --> 22:33.656
Captain Thom just confirmed
that this is what you said.

22:33.700 --> 22:38.444
"I gave you the poison
for Ryan, not Tiffany.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.489
I'm going to have
to fix this."

22:46.669 --> 22:49.106
I just want to know why.

22:55.025 --> 22:58.028
I wanted to get justice
for Lucy.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.424
She was my best friend.

23:06.689 --> 23:10.345
I spent years
looking for answers,

23:10.389 --> 23:13.740
and then Joshua
came back to town.

23:13.783 --> 23:16.917
Joshua had seen
Lucy's old e-mails

23:16.960 --> 23:19.049
on the computer
at J. Dodd's.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.356
He thought Ryan killed Lucy,
and so did you.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.882
Ryan is untouchable.

23:25.926 --> 23:28.972
He's had people
cleaning up his messes

23:29.016 --> 23:31.453
his entire life.

23:31.497 --> 23:34.151
And I know the system
favors the privileged,

23:34.195 --> 23:35.805
but the Hudson family are on

23:35.849 --> 23:37.067
a whole other level.

23:37.111 --> 23:40.941
So you thought that Ryan
deserved to die

23:40.984 --> 23:43.117
because you were tired
of how the world works?

23:43.160 --> 23:46.555
No, because I saw him

23:46.599 --> 23:49.036
preying on another young woman,

23:49.079 --> 23:50.994
the same way he did with Lucy.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.997
You saw him with George.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.609
I couldn't let that
happen again.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.349
An innocent woman is dead
because of you.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.614
You tore her family apart.

24:03.572 --> 24:06.401
You tore two families apart,
actually.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.405
You arrested my dad

24:10.449 --> 24:12.929
for something that he didn't do.

24:12.973 --> 24:17.325
Your father's fingerprints
are on that knife.

24:17.368 --> 24:19.893
He was the Hudson's cleaner.
He did something.

24:19.936 --> 24:23.723
He did not kill Lucy Sable.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.681
I never wanted to hurt you.

24:25.725 --> 24:30.077
I'm just glad my mom's not
around to see who you've become.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.648
Nancy...

24:41.131 --> 24:44.395
[handcuffs click]

24:49.749 --> 24:53.622
At least we finally got
some answers about Tiffany.

24:53.666 --> 24:58.584
Yeah, answers, but not justice.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.847
Josh is still out there.

25:02.892 --> 25:06.548
I wonder how far he got.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.898
Pretty far.

25:08.942 --> 25:11.945
I hear there's a motorboat
missing from the marina.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.992
OFFICER:
Mr. Nickerson.

25:16.036 --> 25:19.474
We're ready to take
your statement now.

25:36.709 --> 25:40.147
Neither. I know Nancy,
I knew she was right.

25:42.628 --> 25:46.153
I'm sorry if
I scared you, though.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.987
Last time we talked,
you promised

25:54.030 --> 25:56.467
after your accident,

25:56.511 --> 25:59.514
you weren't gonna
go back to the force.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.038
Okay, we agreed
that that was safer.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.792
If you're asking
for my blessing,

26:16.836 --> 26:18.185
you're gonna have to wait.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.149
Okay.

26:31.633 --> 26:35.071
I wonder where this Hannah Gruen
is that Nancy mentioned.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.160
Maybe she has
Nancy's work ethic.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.553
[chuckles]

26:40.555 --> 26:44.211
Do you really believe
in the legend of the Aglaeca?

26:44.254 --> 26:46.213
I may not believe, but I know
Nancy saw something,

26:46.256 --> 26:47.475
and I believe her.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.651
Wow. You're so evolved.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.523
Look, here he is.

Captain Douglas Marvin,

26:56.310 --> 26:58.747
our ancestor. Do you... Ew, Bess...

26:58.791 --> 27:02.055
You know, I can't wait to learn
more about our family history.

27:02.098 --> 27:05.972
Well, be careful what
you wish for. Hm, what'd you say?

27:06.015 --> 27:07.669
Nothing. Um,
is there anything

27:07.713 --> 27:09.453
in there about the Aglaeca?

27:09.497 --> 27:11.760
No, I don't think so.
GEORGE: Typical.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.893
300 pages about men

27:13.936 --> 27:17.679
and women get two pages
in the back.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.594
I found something.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.553
Look.

27:22.597 --> 27:26.383
"When the first women
arrived in Horseshoe Bay,

27:26.427 --> 27:27.863
they started weaving stories

27:27.907 --> 27:29.996
about a presence
haunting the waters.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.954
Once a year, on Harbor Day,

27:31.998 --> 27:33.347
they would make requests

27:33.390 --> 27:35.088
of this mysterious
entity they called

27:35.131 --> 27:37.568
the Aglaeca."
Whoa.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.135
Look at that.

27:39.179 --> 27:42.704
BESS:
Wow.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.533
Okay. so it says,
"Step into the water.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.927
Let your heart's desire call her.

27:47.970 --> 27:51.147
Blood payment you will need,
wrapped in chains from the sea."

27:51.191 --> 27:55.064
"Summon your courage and venture
near, to a vision then appear."

27:55.108 --> 27:57.327
"It's the toll you pay,
if you dare.

27:57.371 --> 28:00.113
If unwilling,
then you must beware."

28:00.156 --> 28:03.682
Okay. [chuckles]
So do you think that's how we call her then?

28:03.725 --> 28:06.989
Knowing this town, it would be
in a cryptic nursery rhyme.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.252

Are you guys sure
that you want to do this?

We've reached out
to spirits in the past

28:14.083 --> 28:16.651

always been very mixed.

get possessed again.

Hey, uh,

28:28.968 --> 28:30.796
I need to tell you something.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.146
What is it? Where are you?

28:33.189 --> 28:34.974
Joshua Dodd had an accomplice.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.540
What are you talking about?

28:36.584 --> 28:39.630
The poison that he used
came from police evidence.

28:39.674 --> 28:42.633
It was Karen, Dad.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.679
What?

28:46.028 --> 28:47.987
No, no, no, no, no.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.292
I don't, I don't believe it.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.642
We have proof.
She's in custody right now.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.079
[sighs] Nancy...

28:53.122 --> 28:54.515
Just listen.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.082
If Karen's judgment
is being questioned,

28:56.125 --> 28:59.999
can't we dispute her arrests?
Your arrest?

29:00.042 --> 29:02.784
It won't change anything.

29:02.828 --> 29:06.005
Without physical evidence
linking someone else

29:06.048 --> 29:09.008
to the murder, you won't be able
to prove my innocence.

29:09.051 --> 29:12.663
I don't want to be convicted,

29:12.707 --> 29:14.578
I don't, Nancy,

29:14.622 --> 29:16.885
but you and I both
need to start accepting

29:16.929 --> 29:18.931
that it's going to happen.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.993
Nancy, you okay?

29:38.037 --> 29:40.300
We have to get Lucy's bones.

29:42.302 --> 29:45.914
I need to call to the Aglaeca.

29:53.052 --> 29:54.314
So you want to call
to the Aglaeca

29:54.357 --> 29:56.229
for help finding Lucy's bones?

29:56.272 --> 29:59.623
And why do you think her bones
will help your dad?

29:59.667 --> 30:01.060
Because it's possible

30:01.103 --> 30:03.018
that the real murderer
left clues on them.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.324
ACE: If the attacker
was right-handed,

30:04.367 --> 30:05.586
or they used a knife
that's different

30:05.629 --> 30:07.066
from the one
that they have in evidence,

30:07.109 --> 30:09.198
that would exonerate
your dad, right? Exactly.

30:09.242 --> 30:10.721
NICK: Okay,
b-but I thought

30:10.765 --> 30:12.593

30:27.347 --> 30:30.306
representing the members
of the six founding families.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.700
Also, you have to pay a toll,
which doesn't sound good,

but, hey, who wants to hear
a creepy nursery rhyme?

30:36.095 --> 30:37.052

against. None of us do.

worse than that, right?

Right. Okay, so,
now that's settled.

31:08.997 --> 31:10.999
