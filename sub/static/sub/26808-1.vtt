00:41.940 --> 00:43.899
You're not in a hurry?

00:43.900 --> 00:45.718
Nope, one more client.

00:45.719 --> 00:47.262
Ugh, late night.

00:47.263 --> 00:48.473
Yep, if she shows.

00:49.410 --> 00:51.099
Do you mind finishing
up in the back?

00:51.100 --> 00:52.329
I'm running late already.

00:52.330 --> 00:53.163
I got it.

00:53.164 --> 00:54.419
Don't wanna keep
the boy waiting.

00:54.420 --> 00:55.253
Not this boy.

00:55.253 --> 00:56.253
How do I look?

00:57.840 --> 00:58.879
Beautiful, lady.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.189
He doesn't wait, he's an idiot.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.723
All right, I'll see ya later.

01:06.645 --> 01:07.645
Hi!

01:09.718 --> 01:10.718
Bye!

01:13.370 --> 01:14.709
Hey, Mandy.

01:14.710 --> 01:15.710
Come on over.

01:18.060 --> 01:20.189
I know I was in full support
of growing out the hair,

01:20.190 --> 01:21.962
but it's been too
long, I missed you.

01:23.062 --> 01:23.980
I know, I know.

01:23.981 --> 01:25.073
I've been so busy.

01:26.470 --> 01:28.363
So, what are we doin' tonight?

01:30.030 --> 01:31.580
A wash and a blowout.

01:32.507 --> 01:33.679
You in a hurry?

01:33.680 --> 01:34.821
Yeah.

01:34.822 --> 01:36.649
I was gonna offer you
some wine, but...

01:36.650 --> 01:37.483
Red?

01:37.484 --> 01:39.009
Uh, I think so.

01:39.010 --> 01:40.485
I can make time for that.

01:40.486 --> 01:41.482
Okay.

01:41.482 --> 01:42.482
Thank you.

01:44.992 --> 01:46.039
Merlot?

01:46.040 --> 01:47.040
Winner.

01:55.318 --> 01:56.151
There you go.

01:56.152 --> 01:57.484
Oh, thank you.

01:59.473 --> 02:00.933
So, what's the hurry?

02:02.240 --> 02:05.363
Ugh, throwing a gigantic
party later this evening.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.969
Boss' 25th anniversary
with the company.

02:09.970 --> 02:11.993
I need to look perfect.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.247
We can do that.

02:17.410 --> 02:18.789
I'm hoping this goes a long way

02:18.790 --> 02:21.063
towards finally getting
that promotion.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.258
That glass ceiling
is a real bitch.

02:38.106 --> 02:40.210
So where's the party gonna be?

02:40.211 --> 02:41.916
The Benjamin Lofts.

02:41.917 --> 02:43.500
Have you ever been?

02:44.595 --> 02:45.595
Mm.

02:46.408 --> 02:48.069
It is so gorgeous.

02:48.070 --> 02:50.311
And I hired the best caterer.

02:50.312 --> 02:52.729
Oh, it's gonna taste so good.

03:42.210 --> 03:43.210
Mandy?

03:48.395 --> 03:49.395
Finally.

05:34.599 --> 05:35.599
Fuck.

07:09.001 --> 07:10.001
What?

07:14.949 --> 07:15.992
Mandy, Mandy, calm
down, calm down.

07:15.993 --> 07:17.508
- Claire!
- You're gonna hurt yourself.

07:17.509 --> 07:18.548
Claire, what's happening?!

07:18.549 --> 07:19.801
I just wanna try it on, okay?

07:19.802 --> 07:21.175
I'm gonna give it back.

07:21.176 --> 07:23.468
I just, I need you to be quiet.

07:23.469 --> 07:24.839
- Okay?
- What the fuck, Claire?!

07:24.840 --> 07:28.254
No, I just, I need you, just.

07:28.255 --> 07:30.172
Please, please, please.

07:31.386 --> 07:32.373
I.

07:32.374 --> 07:33.869
Help me!

08:09.825 --> 08:11.149
Hi, Pepper.

08:11.150 --> 08:12.929
Where's my girl?

08:12.930 --> 08:14.469
Come here, baby.

08:14.470 --> 08:15.470
Good girl.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.388
Look what I have.

09:17.837 --> 09:19.413
It's a good one, isn't it?

10:55.260 --> 10:56.523
I need to look perfect.

11:06.380 --> 11:09.103
I need to look perfect.

11:18.730 --> 11:19.880
I need to look perfect.

11:23.162 --> 11:24.162
Uh.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.320
Oh!

11:39.320 --> 11:41.323
That glass ceiling
is a real bitch.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.220
Aaron: Serves me right
just to see you there.

12:18.720 --> 12:19.720
Yeah, man.

12:20.860 --> 12:22.109
Rough night?

12:22.110 --> 12:23.759
Yeah, I'm hurting a
little bit, dude.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.257
Ah, you can see it.

12:25.258 --> 12:26.132
Hold on, you know what,

12:26.132 --> 12:26.965
I gotta get a bottle of water.

12:26.966 --> 12:31.289
Ah, mate, ah, you're
drinkin', man.

12:31.290 --> 12:33.809
So, what you up to today?

12:33.810 --> 12:35.981
This is it, this
is my every day.

12:35.982 --> 12:36.815
Yeah?

12:36.815 --> 12:37.801
- Yeah.
- Lucky to get out,

12:37.802 --> 12:39.535
take advantage of the sun?

13:04.480 --> 13:06.741
12 years old.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.670
So, he was about 17.

13:12.671 --> 13:13.504
17?

13:13.504 --> 13:14.337
Yeah.

13:14.338 --> 13:16.737
So, he was 17, and
the daughter is 12.

13:18.557 --> 13:19.601
- Yeah.
- Awful.

13:19.602 --> 13:24.030
I know, what you do if your
12-year-old got pregnant?

13:24.031 --> 13:26.087
What would you do, Aaron?

13:26.088 --> 13:27.808
Wouldn't be prepared
for that, would you?

13:33.271 --> 13:34.180
You better go out and enjoy
the sun yourself, yeah.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.763
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.223
I don't know, man, probably.

14:21.224 --> 14:22.781
Sure, dude, fuckin' hit me up.

14:22.782 --> 14:25.949
Um, I'm gonna be around
there, I mean, not too late.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.218
Nine o'clock?

14:27.219 --> 14:28.251
Yeah, so just get
in touch with me,

14:28.252 --> 14:31.197
and then maybe we can
grab a couple of beers

14:31.198 --> 14:32.738
and get a little
wild or something.

16:03.982 --> 16:04.982
Mm.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.881
Mm.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.719
You think you can be here,
bastard, I fuckin' told you.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.487
Stay the fuck away from here.

29:38.380 --> 29:39.557
Police!

29:41.995 --> 29:43.162
Open the door!

29:55.509 --> 29:56.509
Police!

30:44.123 --> 30:45.819
No dream, Mueller.

30:45.820 --> 30:46.963
You got the invite.

30:48.010 --> 30:50.409
They called and told
me about it yesterday.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.610
And you waited until
now to tell me, Chef?

30:53.640 --> 30:57.859
Well, I thought it'd be fun
to let you stew a bit.

30:57.860 --> 30:58.860
Man, I thought you
were mad at me

30:58.861 --> 31:00.989
for screwing up the
payroll last week.

31:00.990 --> 31:04.139
Yeah, that's what made it so
much fun to let you stew.

31:04.140 --> 31:05.449
Do you know how long
I've been waiting

31:05.450 --> 31:07.679
for an invitation to Kitchen X?

31:07.680 --> 31:09.969
Yeah, you've been going
on about it for months.

31:09.970 --> 31:11.739
Keep in mind, it's a secret.

31:11.740 --> 31:13.159
There's a reason Kitchen X

31:13.160 --> 31:16.089
is called an underground
restaurant.

31:16.090 --> 31:18.039
Health Department nearly
shut us down a few years ago

31:18.040 --> 31:20.929
because some food
blogger got too mouthy.

31:20.930 --> 31:23.083
This stays between you and me.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.079
God, I hate the
Health Department.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.809
Look, even if I had anyone
to tell, I wouldn't.

31:28.810 --> 31:31.719
I'm serious, Mueller,
you can't tell anyone.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.819
You can't tell any
waitresses or customers

31:33.820 --> 31:37.569
or any of your foodie friends
in your foodie chatrooms.

31:37.570 --> 31:39.883
No one, not even
your girlfriend.

31:42.360 --> 31:47.360
Hannah, I have officially
been invited to Kitchen X.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.259
That's great, hun.

31:50.260 --> 31:53.799
I wish I wasn't outta
town or I'd go with you.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.169
Although, you might
wanna be careful

31:56.170 --> 31:58.289
who you share this info with.

31:58.290 --> 32:01.989
You haven't told
anyone else, have you?

32:01.990 --> 32:04.429
No, no, I promised
Chef John I wouldn't,

32:04.430 --> 32:05.780
but I had to tell somebody.

32:06.887 --> 32:09.073
Hannah, this is it.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.765
This is what my life has
been heading towards.

32:12.766 --> 32:14.189
I've been working
at a restaurant

32:14.190 --> 32:16.129
for as long as I can remember.

32:16.130 --> 32:16.963
When I was a kid,

32:16.964 --> 32:18.399
I worked for the neighborhood
diner washing dishes.

32:18.400 --> 32:21.089
I worked my way through
college serving tables.

32:21.090 --> 32:22.169
Fast forward to now,

32:22.170 --> 32:25.039
and I am the general
manager of a four-star,

32:25.040 --> 32:28.199
chef-driven, fine-dining
establishment,

32:28.200 --> 32:30.249
serving some of the
best food in town.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.409
Well, you seem to
enjoy working there.

32:32.410 --> 32:35.459
It's a great job,
pay's not bad either.

32:35.460 --> 32:36.293
But to be honest,

32:36.294 --> 32:37.859
the best reward is getting
to work with someone

32:37.860 --> 32:40.579
that's the caliber
of Chef John Lando.

32:40.580 --> 32:44.099
The food, the food is killer,

32:44.100 --> 32:46.139
especially in the last
couple of months.

32:46.140 --> 32:47.869
And you know me, I like trying
new recipes, I like to cook,

32:47.870 --> 32:49.719
but if I've got Chef John

32:49.720 --> 32:51.089
cooking for me, why bother?

32:51.090 --> 32:53.339
You're lucky to be
doing what you love.

32:53.340 --> 32:56.859
I've never met anyone who's
as much into food as you are.

32:56.860 --> 32:57.963
I can't help it!

32:58.981 --> 33:00.149
You know, lately, I've been
reading more cookbooks

33:00.150 --> 33:01.764
than I have fiction

33:01.765 --> 33:04.803
and watching more Food
Network than I have films.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.484
Oh, speaking of which, it's a
new Wine Dungeon commercial.

33:12.862 --> 33:13.862
Mm.

33:15.586 --> 33:18.859
Slave, what is that
you are drinking?

33:18.860 --> 33:20.509
It's not a corporate-produced
wine, is it?

33:20.510 --> 33:25.280
No Mistress Beth, it is a
state-grown, I swear it.

33:25.281 --> 33:30.281
Ah, Riesling, I see
you are learning.

33:30.890 --> 33:33.299
This Riesling is not dry!

33:33.300 --> 33:34.829
Don't you Americans know

33:34.830 --> 33:37.719
that your Riesling doesn't
have to be sweet?

33:37.720 --> 33:39.729
Haven't you learned anything?

33:42.800 --> 33:45.199
Don't be punished
by corporate wines.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.399
Don't let bad wines put
you in submission.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.350
Come to the Wine Dungeon
and get what you deserve.

33:52.956 --> 33:57.203
Get 30% off when you
mention this ad.

33:59.250 --> 34:01.567
Mueller, Mueller!

34:02.402 --> 34:04.679
Sorry, I got sidetracked, bleh.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.579
What was I saying?

34:06.580 --> 34:08.869
Oh yeah, look, if
you were to say

34:08.870 --> 34:11.639
my life revolves around food,
I'd say you were right,

34:11.639 --> 34:14.413
and that is a life
well-rewarded.

34:39.583 --> 34:40.416
Hey Chef.

34:40.417 --> 34:41.734
You ready?

34:41.735 --> 34:42.580
You have no idea.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.413
Where is this place?

34:43.414 --> 34:44.579
North of town, don't
worry about it.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.380
I'll drive, you leave
your car here.

34:47.610 --> 34:49.159
What the hell is that?

34:49.159 --> 34:50.418
Bottle of wine I
brought for dinner.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.509
No, don't even think
about bringing that.

34:52.510 --> 34:55.199
Greg and Beth are
pairing wines tonight.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.079
Greg and Beth from
the Wine Dungeon?

34:57.080 --> 34:58.040
The very same.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.573
Do yourself a favor,
leave that in your car.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.449
How many of these things
have you been to, Chef?

35:21.450 --> 35:22.819
Quite a few now.

35:22.820 --> 35:24.379
Each one gets better.

35:24.380 --> 35:25.310
The kid running this thing

35:25.311 --> 35:27.799
really pushes the envelop
with each dinner,

35:27.800 --> 35:29.909
exposing us all to things
we've never tried before.

35:29.910 --> 35:30.989
Who brought you your first time?

35:30.990 --> 35:31.830
French Milt.

35:31.831 --> 35:33.347
Whoa, French Milt?

35:45.020 --> 35:46.279
He's gonna be here tonight?

35:46.280 --> 35:47.379
Oh, he wouldn't miss it.

35:47.380 --> 35:49.553
He usually contributes a
little something on his own.

35:57.610 --> 35:58.610
Ah!

35:59.670 --> 36:01.589
Welcome, my friends.

36:01.590 --> 36:04.023
Welcome to Kitchen X.

36:10.130 --> 36:11.529
It is definitely my pleasure

36:11.530 --> 36:13.480
to serve you this
evening, Mr. Mueller.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.559
That's Teddy from
Spirits Speakeasy.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.349
I love the cocktails there.

36:21.350 --> 36:22.350
Come.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.379
May I present diver scallop

36:38.380 --> 36:41.239
wrapped with
applewood-smoked bacon,

36:41.240 --> 36:43.959
topped with a pimenton
parsnip puree

36:43.960 --> 36:48.960
with Espelette pepper
and a mustard seed.

36:50.515 --> 36:51.348
Ow!

36:51.349 --> 36:53.039
I paired the scallop
with this impressive

36:53.040 --> 36:56.409
little sparkler from
Spain, Via dei Borgia,

36:56.410 --> 36:59.599
mostly because I thought
the terroir of a Bourgogne

36:59.600 --> 37:02.209
would have been
too overpowering.

37:02.210 --> 37:03.779
The delicacy of the scallops

37:03.780 --> 37:07.374
seem to call for something
a bit more flighty.

37:11.570 --> 37:16.499
Hi, I'm Beth, I'm from
the Wine Dungeon.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.500
Hi.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.589
Uh, I'm a big fan
of you and Greg.

37:21.590 --> 37:23.629
It's an honor to meet you.

37:23.630 --> 37:26.103
I'm Mueller, I work for
John at Lando Seafood.

37:27.590 --> 37:28.913
I love your commercials.

37:30.090 --> 37:31.729
Oh, thank you, Mueller.

37:31.730 --> 37:32.989
Always nice to help someone

37:32.990 --> 37:36.340
develop their taste
for fine wines.

37:36.341 --> 37:39.579
You don't drink corporate
wines, do you?

37:39.580 --> 37:41.063
Because if you do.

37:44.320 --> 37:47.049
I'm just kidding, honey.

37:47.050 --> 37:48.789
Actually, I put
together a wine list

37:48.790 --> 37:49.799
for Lando with some of...

37:49.800 --> 37:51.519
I've actually never been there,

37:51.520 --> 37:53.779
but I've heard some nice things.

37:53.780 --> 37:56.763
If you ever want to
develop your wine list,

37:57.730 --> 37:59.030
you should give me a call.

38:03.910 --> 38:05.939
You know, I've been there.

38:05.940 --> 38:08.889
Yeah, I wrote about its
opening in my blog.

38:08.890 --> 38:10.989
I wasn't that impressed
with the service.

38:10.990 --> 38:13.239
It seemed a bit untrained.

38:13.240 --> 38:14.939
As I mentioned on
my blog, you know,

38:14.940 --> 38:18.209
the food was a bit
uneven for my tastes.

38:18.210 --> 38:20.969
A couple of the commenters
on my blog seem to agree,

38:20.970 --> 38:23.689
but I'm sure you've worked
out those problems.

38:23.690 --> 38:26.072
I'd like to think we have.

38:26.073 --> 38:28.173
Oh, well, in that case,

38:29.270 --> 38:30.270
kudos.

38:39.790 --> 38:42.779
Come, let me introduce
you to some people.

38:42.780 --> 38:45.499
Shannon, have you
met Mr. Mueller?

38:45.500 --> 38:47.649
I just love your restaurant.

38:47.650 --> 38:50.779
Why, we haven't chatted
since, when was it?

38:50.780 --> 38:52.839
You know, it seems like
just the other week,

38:52.840 --> 38:55.429
I was telling Dwayne over
at the farmer's market

38:55.430 --> 38:58.439
just how good the food
was over at your place.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.094
You know Dwayne, right?

39:00.095 --> 39:00.928
Uh, yeah...

39:00.929 --> 39:03.119
He just finished an excellent
organic wine dinner

39:03.120 --> 39:05.689
that was mind-blowing.

39:05.690 --> 39:07.959
I told him that I
really loved lobster,

39:07.960 --> 39:09.049
and you know what he does?

39:09.050 --> 39:10.149
He puts lobster on the menu.

39:10.150 --> 39:12.159
You have met Teddy,

39:12.160 --> 39:15.753
but have you met French
Milt from Amuse-bouche?

39:17.200 --> 39:18.713
It's an honor, Chef.

39:32.462 --> 39:34.729
The first course is
just about ready,

39:34.730 --> 39:39.399
and I need to apply
some finishing touches.

39:39.400 --> 39:42.929
Would you mind
entertaining Mr. Mueller

39:42.930 --> 39:45.454
while I see to the kitchen?

39:45.455 --> 39:46.455
Ha, thank you.

39:53.308 --> 39:56.289
Well, this place
is wonderful, huh?

39:56.290 --> 39:58.019
How 'bout those scallops, huh?

39:58.020 --> 40:00.739
Amazing, they were
soft and velvety,

40:00.740 --> 40:02.949
and they were wrapped in
that smoked bacon, right?

40:02.950 --> 40:04.959
Actually, the bacon should
have been described

40:04.960 --> 40:07.059
as cured instead of smoked.

40:07.060 --> 40:09.369
The devise Brandon
used involved pellets

40:09.370 --> 40:10.649
instead of actual hardwood,

40:10.650 --> 40:13.549
which negates it
as being smoked.

40:13.550 --> 40:17.449
And personally, I would have
referred to it as pork belly,

40:17.450 --> 40:19.250
since that's where
bacon comes from.

40:20.290 --> 40:21.859
You you know that, right?

40:21.860 --> 40:23.060
It comes from the belly?

40:28.470 --> 40:29.779
And that was such an
inventive pairing,

40:29.780 --> 40:34.099
the champagne and the bubbles
and the scallops, wow.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.499
That's all I can say.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.929
You and Greg really
know what you're doing.

40:36.930 --> 40:38.769
It's not really all
that inventive,

40:38.770 --> 40:40.129
if you think about it.

40:40.130 --> 40:42.139
The pepper is counteracted

40:42.140 --> 40:44.099
by the cool crispness
of the Spanish grape.

40:44.100 --> 40:48.309
The acidity cuts through the
spice at, cuts it in half.

40:48.310 --> 40:51.529
In fact, the pairing of
sparkling and scallops

40:51.530 --> 40:52.530
is as old...

40:53.950 --> 40:57.889
Ladies and gentlemen,
course one is now ready.

40:57.890 --> 41:00.443
Please, join me at the table.

41:17.570 --> 41:19.569
For the first course
of this evening,

41:19.570 --> 41:24.570
I am proud to present my
version Reuben deconstructed,

41:25.570 --> 41:30.570
complete with a corn beef
Wagyu, sauerkraut emulsion,

41:31.110 --> 41:35.569
a Swiss cheese cream,
Russian foam dressing,

41:35.570 --> 41:37.203
and a rye crouton.

41:38.050 --> 41:41.179
I would like to
thank Beth and Greg

41:41.180 --> 41:46.120
for pairing this with a lovely
pinot from Stover Creek.

41:46.955 --> 41:49.149
Oh, the '07 vintage, of course.

41:49.150 --> 41:51.506
Dungeon approved.

41:52.341 --> 41:54.819
Ah, please, everyone enjoy.

41:54.820 --> 41:58.113
We eat to support life
and to practice the way.

42:16.940 --> 42:21.419
Mm, corn beefing Wagyu,.

42:21.420 --> 42:25.019
Oh Brendan, you are
something of a treat.

42:25.020 --> 42:27.029
This is actually my first
time getting to taste Wagyu.

42:27.030 --> 42:29.079
These flavors are amazing.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.529
The Japanese believed they can
flavor this exclusive meat

42:32.530 --> 42:35.849
with extensive care
and attention.

42:35.850 --> 42:38.349
Not only do they
control their diet,

42:38.350 --> 42:42.389
but they can feed the
cows beer and sake.

42:42.390 --> 42:45.139
And they massage the cows, dude.

42:45.140 --> 42:46.153
What a way to go.

42:47.320 --> 42:50.389
The flavors in this
dish are so compelling.

42:50.390 --> 42:52.859
I wish I could take a
photograph for my blog.

42:52.860 --> 42:54.069
No photos!

42:54.070 --> 42:57.643
I know, I just wish I could.

43:00.163 --> 43:02.319
Wait till you try
the next course.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.220
Kidney.

43:03.221 --> 43:04.719
Oh, how are you
cooking the kidney?

43:04.720 --> 43:08.069
Oh, kidney is a fun little dish.

43:08.070 --> 43:11.409
First, you gotta get in and
pull off the membrane,

43:11.410 --> 43:12.243
but you're gonna need to leave

43:12.244 --> 43:14.499
a little fat on there
for flavor, you know.

43:14.500 --> 43:17.149
Now, most people'll tell ya
that you gotta marinate it

43:17.150 --> 43:18.979
with a little vinegar
and soy sauce

43:18.980 --> 43:21.219
because it's a
pretty stinky organ,

43:21.220 --> 43:24.199
but I like to add just a
little bit of milk in there

43:24.200 --> 43:25.983
to cut right through the flavor.

43:27.060 --> 43:30.539
Then, a little garlic,
a little onion,

43:30.540 --> 43:33.289
and we dice that kidney up
into little half inchers

43:33.290 --> 43:35.839
and drop it in, a little simmer.

43:35.840 --> 43:39.463
Add some aromatics like a
bonyato or some carrots.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.809
What's wrong, Mueller?

43:46.810 --> 43:49.183
Little awful talk
makin' ya uneasy?

43:50.150 --> 43:52.429
That's the problem
with most Americans.

43:52.430 --> 43:54.249
They don't respect the awful.

43:54.250 --> 43:57.607
No one seems to realize that
tenderloins are finite.

43:59.957 --> 44:02.739
I'm sorry, I got dizzy
all of a sudden.

44:02.740 --> 44:05.957
You don't have a shellfish
or peanut allergy, do you?

44:07.047 --> 44:08.449
Uh, not that I know of.

44:08.450 --> 44:10.459
If I had a shellfish allergy,

44:10.460 --> 44:11.909
I'd just have to kill myself.

44:11.910 --> 44:13.159
Me too.

44:13.160 --> 44:15.769
My all-time favorite
wine is Vermentino,

44:15.770 --> 44:18.819
especially the later
Sardinian vintages.

44:18.820 --> 44:21.161
I can't fathom not
enjoying shrimp.

44:23.048 --> 44:24.168
What's the matter, buddy?

44:24.885 --> 44:26.839
You don't look so good.

44:26.840 --> 44:28.759
I'm sorry, everyone.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.319
I think the bubbles
from that champagne

44:31.320 --> 44:32.969
are going to my head.

44:32.970 --> 44:34.139
It's not champagne

44:34.140 --> 44:36.749
unless it comes from
the region in France.

44:36.750 --> 44:39.343
What you had was a Spanish Cava.

44:42.613 --> 44:45.449
Uh, Mr. Mueller, would
you like to lie down?

44:45.450 --> 44:48.779
I have a little room just to
the right of the kitchen,

44:48.780 --> 44:49.907
if you like.

45:00.870 --> 45:04.077
Hey buddy, how you doin'?

45:04.976 --> 45:05.976
You did all right.

45:06.860 --> 45:09.163
Chef, what's going on?

45:10.890 --> 45:12.539
Why am I in this tub?

45:12.540 --> 45:14.409
Hang in there, buddy.

45:14.410 --> 45:17.179
You just got a little
ill at dinner.

45:17.180 --> 45:19.080
You just need to rest
up a little bit.

45:22.380 --> 45:23.899
Chef, Chef, get me outta here.

45:23.900 --> 45:25.863
It's frickin' freezing in here.

45:27.220 --> 45:28.676
We'll get ya out
in a little bit.

45:28.677 --> 45:30.333
You just need to relax.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.630
You don't wanna injure
yourself anymore, do ya?

45:43.588 --> 45:45.671
I'm bleeding.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.103
Chef, why am I bleeding?

45:49.540 --> 45:52.963
Chef, what am I doing in
this tub with all this ice?

45:56.400 --> 45:57.873
What, what are you doing?

45:58.970 --> 46:02.219
French Milt said if that guy
keeps freaking out like that,

46:02.220 --> 46:04.269
he's gonna pump adrenaline
through his body,

46:04.270 --> 46:06.399
and I don't want him
spoiling those ribs

46:06.400 --> 46:07.729
before I have a chance to show

46:07.730 --> 46:10.259
the impressive pairing
I have for them.

46:10.260 --> 46:11.409
Rose, buddy.

46:11.410 --> 46:14.349
Not in the neck, you idiot.

46:14.350 --> 46:17.679
You think tasting the adrenaline
and the endorphins are bad?

46:17.680 --> 46:19.039
Once those drugs hit his system,

46:19.040 --> 46:21.519
we'll be tasting
chemicals all night.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.353
You have any idea

46:22.354 --> 46:24.893
what I've been feeding
this guy for a week?

46:37.231 --> 46:39.069
Please, somebody help me!

46:39.070 --> 46:40.716
That would be the dinner bell.

46:54.133 --> 46:58.429
Mm, Brandon, these black beans
are a wonderful addition.

46:58.430 --> 47:00.849
The thigh really is
more marbled, Milt.

47:00.850 --> 47:02.519
You were right.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.543
I like the skin, crispy.

47:06.710 --> 47:08.423
Where are the skins?

47:09.570 --> 47:11.389
Oh, don't worry, pal.

47:11.390 --> 47:13.819
I'll get ya some skins
for your doggie bag.

47:13.820 --> 47:15.809
We'll have to process him
before the night's over,

47:15.810 --> 47:18.839
so they'll be plenty
of stuff for everybody

47:18.840 --> 47:21.019
for late night snackin'.

47:21.020 --> 47:22.269
Bully's picked on me in school.

47:22.270 --> 47:23.703
I never really fit in.

47:25.370 --> 47:30.233
I admit I thought about suicide
for a long, long time,

47:31.693 --> 47:36.210
but that's when I found food,
and I finally belonged,

47:37.564 --> 47:39.619
and I started the blog,
and it was like,

47:39.620 --> 47:44.369
for the first time, food
gave my life meaning.

47:44.370 --> 47:47.373
He may have been a little
old for my tastes.

47:48.590 --> 47:52.910
Think about it, nobody eats a
farm animal in its late 20s.

47:52.911 --> 47:53.919
Yeah, that's why your work

47:53.920 --> 47:56.453
with molecular gastronomy
is so amazing.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.410
It's not tough or
stringy at all.

48:00.580 --> 48:03.949
So, what's the next course?

48:03.950 --> 48:06.099
It's something to know

48:06.100 --> 48:08.889
I can look back on those
bullies back in school

48:08.890 --> 48:11.589
and know that they know nothing

48:11.590 --> 48:14.894
about the difference between
cured ham and prosciutto.

48:15.729 --> 48:19.039
Savages know nothing
of sous vide, right?

48:19.040 --> 48:22.333
Enjoy your white
zinfandel, peons.

48:26.540 --> 48:27.740
Check his temperature.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.450
Don't hit the bone, dude.

48:31.400 --> 48:32.400
I know.

48:38.383 --> 48:40.782
Teddy, Teddy, what's going on?

48:40.783 --> 48:42.409
Calm down.

48:42.410 --> 48:46.142
Oh my god, is that
meat thermometer?

48:49.039 --> 48:50.734
Please, don't do this, please!

48:50.735 --> 48:52.382
Please, don't do this!

48:52.383 --> 48:53.703
He's still squealing in here?

48:55.000 --> 48:56.084
Check these out.

48:56.085 --> 48:56.950
They come up in New York.

48:56.951 --> 48:58.279
This one's for power.

48:58.280 --> 48:59.430
This one's for finesse.

49:02.379 --> 49:04.632
Plus, they cut
through bone, dude.

49:11.546 --> 49:13.463
No, no, no!

49:16.780 --> 49:19.763
Hold still or it's gonna
hurt a whole lot worse!

49:25.998 --> 49:27.579
You better get a
rollin' pin in here.

49:27.580 --> 49:29.899
We gotta shut this guy up!

49:29.900 --> 49:32.469
John: I'll take care
of this, French Milt.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.453
Relax, and wrap those
fingers in bacon.

49:36.150 --> 49:37.705
Remember, there's eight of us,

49:37.706 --> 49:40.006
and we need all of his
fingers, and no thumbs.

49:41.301 --> 49:42.634
Those are nasty.

49:50.539 --> 49:52.689
I was gonna make a little
pate out of these guys,

49:52.690 --> 49:54.663
but they went a different route.

49:55.710 --> 49:57.409
Personally, I think
whole sous vide thing

49:57.410 --> 50:02.001
is a passing phase and
overrated, but when in Rome.

50:14.185 --> 50:17.049
Wow, I don't think we're
topping that thigh.

50:17.050 --> 50:20.079
Hey, anybody want a Pimm's?

50:20.080 --> 50:21.699
Oh, I just adore Pimm's.

50:21.700 --> 50:22.700
I'll have some.

50:22.701 --> 50:24.599
Don't even think of
ruining your palate

50:24.600 --> 50:26.099
with those botanicals.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.739
The juniper in that liquor

50:27.740 --> 50:30.019
will counteract the
delicate tannins

50:30.020 --> 50:32.509
and soft finish of the
Burgundy I've selected.

50:32.510 --> 50:34.469
Oh, but this is gin-based.

50:34.470 --> 50:36.759
I've got the Pimm's
number six up.

50:36.760 --> 50:37.899
It's vodka.

50:37.900 --> 50:39.579
I thought they stopped
making that years ago.

50:39.580 --> 50:40.580
They did.

51:18.330 --> 51:20.079
So, tell me, Brandon,

51:20.080 --> 51:23.339
what inspired genius we'll be
enjoying in the next course.

51:23.340 --> 51:25.409
Ah, it's a little something

51:25.410 --> 51:28.709
French Milt and John,
they dream up.

51:28.710 --> 51:32.319
We take the fingers,
we wrap them in bacon,

51:32.320 --> 51:35.869
and serve them over
white bean cassoulet.

51:35.870 --> 51:38.693
The white beans are from
the farmer's market.

51:38.694 --> 51:39.694
Oh.

51:40.441 --> 51:42.319
Still think it's
fundamentally wrong

51:42.320 --> 51:43.409
that we're keepin' him alive.

51:43.410 --> 51:45.279
I mean, really, it is not right.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.189
You're being ridiculous.

51:47.190 --> 51:48.372
Am I really?

51:48.373 --> 51:50.889
It is a proven fact
that the hogfish,

51:50.890 --> 51:54.119
which is headshot in the
Keys, dies more quickly,

51:54.120 --> 51:56.249
so heart stops pumpin'
blood to the organs,

51:56.250 --> 51:58.189
which, in turn,
preserves the meat.

51:58.190 --> 52:01.713
The fish never goes into
shock, mean never gets sour.

52:50.010 --> 52:51.999
Ancient cultures
have long believed

52:52.000 --> 52:54.079
that fear seasons the kill.

52:54.080 --> 52:56.439
Fear and maybe a little
bit of bacon fat.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.499
Everything tastes
better with bacon.

52:58.500 --> 53:02.063
I prefer to do my flavorings
with my meat myself.

53:11.970 --> 53:14.060
So Brandon, how does he taste?

53:15.266 --> 53:16.266
Hannah?

53:18.418 --> 53:20.049
You're a part of this?

53:20.050 --> 53:21.153
Shit!

53:26.603 --> 53:28.769
I actually googled Donner party

53:28.770 --> 53:29.770
cookin' methods the other day.

53:29.771 --> 53:31.969
I musta looked at 100
different sites.

53:31.970 --> 53:33.869
And there was this
very droll documentary

53:33.870 --> 53:35.899
about the whole affair,
which I have to say,

53:35.900 --> 53:38.269
conveniently left out how
they prepared the food.

53:38.270 --> 53:40.779
Oh, that's ridiculous.

53:40.780 --> 53:43.219
Those who don't learn about
mistakes in the past

53:43.220 --> 53:45.159
are condemned to repeat them.

53:45.160 --> 53:47.299
That's what they say.

53:47.300 --> 53:49.190
Or something like that anyway.

53:50.287 --> 53:53.119
The only thing I did find
was one word, roasted,

53:53.120 --> 53:54.439
which could mean anything.

53:54.440 --> 53:55.849
I mean, how did they roast it?

53:55.850 --> 53:58.049
Did they use wood like in
a traditional barbecue,

53:58.050 --> 54:02.842
and if so, what kinda wood,
hickory, oak, larch?

54:02.843 --> 54:04.793
I think they used
mesquite out West.

54:24.510 --> 54:26.177
Stop your whining.

54:33.262 --> 54:34.262
Greg.

54:35.086 --> 54:38.699
Greg?

54:38.700 --> 54:39.700
Greg?

54:46.520 --> 54:48.547
Now, it's my pleasure
to serve you.

55:06.610 --> 55:09.519
Where do you think
you're going, Mueller?

55:09.520 --> 55:10.718
Look at you.

55:10.719 --> 55:15.139
Tch, tch, tch, you won't make
it a block in your condition,

55:15.140 --> 55:17.079
not unless you let me help you.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.183
It's cold out there.

55:20.790 --> 55:23.129
Give us the bottle, Mueller.

55:23.130 --> 55:26.399
Stop being such a
naughty boy, Mueller.

55:26.400 --> 55:28.919
You know you don't
wanna hurt us.

55:28.920 --> 55:30.679
If you put that bottle down,

55:30.680 --> 55:34.053
I promise I'll give you the
spanking of your life.

55:35.900 --> 55:37.773
You know you wanna
give it to me.

55:40.350 --> 55:42.727
I like my wine full bodied.

56:06.890 --> 56:10.449
I am sick and tired

56:10.450 --> 56:13.693
of being the one getting cut on.

56:14.990 --> 56:17.471
I'm gonna kill everyone
of you sick mother...

56:29.200 --> 56:30.652
Hannah.

56:33.820 --> 56:35.683
You little food whore.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.539
You guys owe me big
time for this one.

56:42.540 --> 56:45.209
I was just supposed
to seduce the prey.

56:45.210 --> 56:47.503
It was your job
to make the kill.

56:48.860 --> 56:51.063
Oh well, the things I
do for a good meal.

56:53.970 --> 56:55.083
Nice shot, Hannah.

56:57.330 --> 56:58.919
See what I was
tellin' ya, Brandon?

56:58.920 --> 57:01.739
Instant kill stops the heart,
meat doesn't go into shock.

57:01.740 --> 57:04.259
I still think there are
exquisite flavors you get

57:04.260 --> 57:06.469
when blood pump
through the heart,

57:06.470 --> 57:09.349
especially the fearful heart.

57:09.350 --> 57:11.619
You remember pig
we have last week.

57:11.620 --> 57:12.770
Oh, you mean the cop?

57:15.150 --> 57:17.829
What do we do about
all these bodies?

57:17.830 --> 57:20.179
That's a whole lot of meat.

57:20.180 --> 57:22.329
I have a very big deep freezer.

57:22.330 --> 57:24.680
Let's chunk these bodies
up and get 'em on ice.

57:26.090 --> 57:27.640
Let's get this heart out quick.

57:50.221 --> 57:52.972

58:14.670 --> 58:15.670
You're late.

58:19.640 --> 58:22.083
Last minute red tape,
but we're here.

58:23.060 --> 58:24.060
Burton.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.600
Can you please open this, sir?

58:28.690 --> 58:31.029
There's no need to call me sir.

58:32.615 --> 58:36.370
My friends call me Snake,
you know, like Plissken.

58:49.570 --> 58:50.570
It's clear.

59:06.350 --> 59:07.400
Keep movin', idiot.

59:22.729 --> 59:24.109
Are you ready for this last step

59:24.110 --> 59:26.007
in your recovery program, R.J.?

59:30.200 --> 59:32.113
And why are we doing this?

59:33.290 --> 59:36.969
I have to know,
once and for all,

59:36.970 --> 59:40.173
that what I saw that
night wasn't real,

59:41.250 --> 59:46.250
that it was just a figment of
my overactive imagination.

59:47.350 --> 59:48.679
Good.

59:48.680 --> 59:50.709
The sooner you can accept that,

59:50.710 --> 59:52.843
the sooner you can move
on with your life.

59:59.410 --> 01:00:00.410
Good luck, kid.

01:00:01.522 --> 01:00:02.939
Thanks, Burton.

01:00:38.693 --> 01:00:41.009
We'll give him 10 minutes.

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:44.181
So, what happened in there
that made him go all nutso?

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.382
Seven years ago, his
brother went missing.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:50.613
R.J. was babysitting
him at the time.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.179
He went looking for his
sibling all around the house

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.799
and later found him
dead in the basement.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.543
He suffered a total mental
breakdown from the trauma.

01:01:42.641 --> 01:01:44.809
He went into a catatonic state,

01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.329
didn't talk or
communicate for a year.

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:49.979
He blamed himself for
his brother's death.

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:51.423
How'd his brother die?

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:53.833
He bled to death.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.033
Somebody stabbed him?

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.943
Actually, someone cut
his genitals off.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.910
Poor kid.

01:02:01.911 --> 01:02:06.379
By the way, they never did
find his you know what.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.049
Or the person who did it,

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.073
which only added to
R.J.'s paranoia.

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:13.069
His religious parents
had warned him

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:14.859
about playing with himself.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.579
Masturbation was the
most sinful thing

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.769
you could do in that household,

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:20.779
and if you gave into
such devilish behavior,

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.523
the knob goblin would get you.

01:02:42.401 --> 01:02:44.059
All right, you bastard.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:47.422
If you're real, show yourself.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.899
We may never know who
actually killed his brother,

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.509
but at least we can get some
closure for R.J.'s psyche.

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:13.409
The last step is acknowledging

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:18.410
there's no such thing as demonic
creatures in the basement.

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.283
Time's up R.J.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.757
Did you hear me, R.J.?

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.440
Well, shit.

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:11.150
What the hell you doin'?

01:04:12.332 --> 01:04:13.332
Call the police.

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:20.267
