so I can't really
pick anybody to shoot.

20:56.673 --> 21:00.218
I'm saying, I kind of want
to pick someone

21:00.259 --> 21:02.887
who sort of deserves it
a little.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.932
I thought some guy
might be scolding his wife

21:05.974 --> 21:07.392
in a not cool way,

21:07.433 --> 21:11.020
or some dude might kick his dog,
I was hoping.

21:11.062 --> 21:14.732
But I can't fucking
see anything.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.778
BERNICE: I'm not going-- you
can't just shoot someone, John.

21:18.820 --> 21:22.240
-JOHN: Yeah, but I am.
-BERNICE: Well, you're not.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.242
JOHN:
Well, I am.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.246
I'm just gonna wing them,
but I'm gonna do it.

21:28.287 --> 21:33.668
BERNICE: There's no one doing
anything like what you said.

21:33.710 --> 21:37.714
I don't see anyone doing
anything like that.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.718
JOHN:
Shit.

21:41.759 --> 21:44.554
BERNICE:
There's just two old ladies,

21:44.595 --> 21:47.098
and a guy, like,
walking to work.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.518
A kid playing the accordion

21:50.560 --> 21:53.855
beside his father
for spare change.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.649
JOHN: Man, I really need
to shoot somebody. Fuck.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.985
PETER: So-- okay,
so possibly, I can help.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.278
JOHN:
Cool.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.196
PETER:
We travel to Europe plenty.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.990
-McMillan.
-JOHN: Okay.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.993
PETER: These dark-haired boys
who play accordion in the Metro,

22:07.035 --> 22:10.455
in the parks, right here,
they're not regular little boys.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.331
They're accordion slaves.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.042
BERNICE:
Accordion slaves?

22:14.083 --> 22:16.878
PETER: They're Romanian slaves,
these accordion boys.

22:16.919 --> 22:20.256
They're abducted from Romania,
from Gypsy clans,

22:20.298 --> 22:24.093
by older Gypsies, in order
to play accordion music here

22:24.135 --> 22:26.095
for tourists, for spare change.

22:26.137 --> 22:30.099
They sleep in crowded shitholes,

22:30.141 --> 22:33.519
and they're paid
monthly pennies.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.147
They'll play these melodies
for ten years,

22:36.189 --> 22:37.356
and never earn enough money

22:37.398 --> 22:41.194
to buy, say, uh,
an ordinary belt.

22:41.235 --> 22:44.363
The accordion slaves of Paris.

22:44.405 --> 22:47.450
They have pimps. See?

22:47.492 --> 22:48.868
Right there.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.079
BERNICE:
That man is not his father?

22:51.120 --> 22:52.497
PETER:
No.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.624
BERNICE:
He's an accordion pimp.

22:54.665 --> 22:56.626
PETER:
Yep. He likely oversees

22:56.667 --> 23:01.255
a clan of a hundred
accordion boys.

23:01.297 --> 23:04.467
I first took notice
a-a few years ago,

23:04.509 --> 23:07.678
when these children's faces,
I noticed,

23:07.720 --> 23:10.932
even as they played
their joyful tunes,

23:10.973 --> 23:14.352
were bereft and soulless.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.562
They have slave faces.

23:16.604 --> 23:19.857
Because they're forced
to panhandle forever.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.069
For accordion pimps.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.696
JOHN:
Mom?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.365
BERNICE:
Yes.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.617
JOHN:
Can I shoot the accordion pimp?

23:29.659 --> 23:33.371
BERNICE:
Yes.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.039
What?

23:35.081 --> 23:37.083
BERNICE: Well,
I kind of want to see that.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.501
PETER:
Me, too.

23:38.543 --> 23:41.587
Well, just... watch
from here, I guess.

23:41.629 --> 23:44.048
Or just-- leave would be best.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.469
What do you do, Bernice?

23:48.511 --> 23:51.305
BERNICE:
Secretary of Transportation.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.307
PETER:
Of America?

23:53.349 --> 23:54.517
BERNICE:
Yeah.

23:54.559 --> 23:55.893
PETER:
You're a cabinet member?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.353
BERNICE:
Yeah.

23:57.395 --> 23:59.814
PETER:
You really shouldn't be here.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.445
(accordion playing)

24:06.487 --> 24:09.073
BERNICE:
Is he doing this left-handed?

24:09.115 --> 24:12.118
PETER: Uh, due-- yeah--
I think, to-to the fingers.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.536
BERNICE:
Well... (stammers)

24:13.578 --> 24:15.580
Is that gonna affect his aim?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.837
(accordion stops)

24:22.879 --> 24:24.046
Oh, no.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.506
Oh, gosh.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.133
What just happened? Fuck.

24:27.175 --> 24:28.384
Yeah.

24:28.426 --> 24:31.053
BERNICE:
Did he shoot the accordion boy?

24:31.095 --> 24:34.682
PETER:
He did, yeah. He did.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.267
Yeah.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.936
We should leave now.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.356
Leave.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.400
Yeah.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.117
(siren wailing)

25:37.078 --> 25:39.664
Fuck!

25:47.505 --> 25:49.257
Damn it.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.884
I'm gonna take a nap.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.636
Shut it down.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.638
(exhales)

25:55.680 --> 25:59.350
Shut it down.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.394
Yeah, right.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.481
Fuck!

26:05.523 --> 26:07.692
(siren wailing)

28:44.515 --> 28:46.517
(panting)

29:09.123 --> 29:11.125
(siren wailing)

29:55.878 --> 29:57.630
Sure Shot?

29:57.671 --> 29:59.381
JOHN:
Yeah.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.801
PETER: Maybe you're not
Sure Shot anymore.

30:02.843 --> 30:07.806
Maybe you should
stop taking shots, eh?

30:09.934 --> 30:12.603
I'm not quite sure
how this works,

30:12.645 --> 30:17.274
but I imagine, John, if you
shoot at someone and miss,

30:17.316 --> 30:20.486
possibly, that someone
turns and shoots back.

30:20.528 --> 30:22.488
At you-- no bueno.

30:22.530 --> 30:26.367
So maybe it's time for you
to stop taking shots...

30:28.410 --> 30:31.413
...is what I'm saying,

30:31.455 --> 30:34.792
John.

30:34.833 --> 30:38.003
JOHN: I had to shoot
someone today, man.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.631
It's just what I had to do.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.175
And I didn't do it.

30:43.217 --> 30:46.262
I just grazed
that accordion boy.

30:46.303 --> 30:47.972
He's not gonna
go to the hospital.

30:48.013 --> 30:51.141
-Big whoop.
-No, it is, Peter.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.768
It's a whole thing.

30:52.810 --> 30:57.022
It's not Milwaukee,
it's a whole thing.

30:57.064 --> 31:00.859
Someone had to go
to the hospital.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.906
ALICE:
I don't understand.

31:05.948 --> 31:08.534
If you know all this
about my husband,

31:08.576 --> 31:10.828
why don't you just arrest him?

31:10.869 --> 31:13.831
AGATHE:
He's been instructed

31:13.872 --> 31:16.792
to commit a murder
in Luxembourg.

31:16.834 --> 31:20.963
Which is considered a crime
in Luxembourg, the instructions.

31:21.005 --> 31:22.673
And I am obligated to learn

31:22.715 --> 31:24.883
who his instructor is
and arrest him.

31:24.925 --> 31:29.888
For conspiracy to commit
a homicide in Luxembourg.

31:29.930 --> 31:33.267
And I know
who his instructor is.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.477
I won't talk about that.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.479
-Alice.
-What?

31:37.521 --> 31:41.108
I need help organizing
his arrest.

31:45.988 --> 31:49.366
Alice, if you help me
arrest John's father,

31:49.408 --> 31:51.827
I won't arrest John.

31:54.788 --> 31:57.875
ALICE:
What would happen to John?

31:57.916 --> 32:00.294
Myna asked me why your husband
is so sad

32:00.336 --> 32:02.880
and I didn't know the answer
to that then,

32:02.921 --> 32:06.050
but when I learned who
his instructor was, I knew.

32:06.091 --> 32:09.470
Your husband brutalizes anyone
who interferes

32:09.511 --> 32:11.889
with the execution
of his instructions

32:11.930 --> 32:13.807
and he can't stop doing this

32:13.849 --> 32:16.894
because of the identity
of his instructor,

32:16.935 --> 32:21.315
despite all the harm
it causes him.

32:21.357 --> 32:26.278
But you can make it stop
if you help me with this arrest.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.698
Je veux la main.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.409
What does that mean?

32:32.451 --> 32:35.329
-I want the hand.
-The hand?

32:35.371 --> 32:37.665
Not the sword.

32:37.706 --> 32:41.168
I need two things, Alice,
to make this arrest.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.212
I need proof Thomas Tavner
was in Luxembourg.

32:43.253 --> 32:46.882
-You'll never get that.
-I have that.

32:46.924 --> 32:50.260
Now I need to apprehend him
in the presence of the money,

32:50.302 --> 32:53.889
the money that motivated
these murders.

32:53.931 --> 32:56.141
To seize him with this money,

32:56.183 --> 32:59.603
over which two men died,
I cannot do this alone.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.902
Alice.

33:06.944 --> 33:11.990
Your husband is crying mercy,
but he has no voice.

33:24.420 --> 33:27.381
Please make sure Myna
attends to her math homework

33:27.423 --> 33:29.550
as she's not
a natural math student

33:29.591 --> 33:31.301
and once you fall behind
in that discipline,

33:31.343 --> 33:33.971
it is hard to catch up.

33:38.976 --> 33:41.979
Agathe.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.106
Why'd you take the money?

33:44.148 --> 33:46.066
The answer will disturb you.

33:46.108 --> 33:49.778
I don't care.

33:49.820 --> 33:53.198
Your husband has physically
assaulted multiple men and women

33:53.240 --> 33:55.409
who have come between him
and this money.

33:55.451 --> 33:58.620
He would ravage the women
I work with.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.998
I took the money from them
because of your husband's

34:01.039 --> 34:04.084
extraordinary brutality
and aggression.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.921
I want the women
with whom I work

34:07.963 --> 34:10.048
uninvolved
in the final matters

34:10.090 --> 34:14.011
of his and his instructor's
arrest and capture.

34:14.052 --> 34:18.432
My colleagues aren't aware that
I continue to make this case.

34:18.474 --> 34:21.435
They believe another party's
responsible.

34:21.477 --> 34:24.980
That's safer for them.

34:25.022 --> 34:27.149
So I'm alone.

34:27.191 --> 34:29.401
So I need your help.

34:34.698 --> 34:38.243
What the fuck is wrong with you?

34:38.285 --> 34:41.538
You're afraid of him but you
leave your daughter with him.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.499
He wouldn't hurt Myna.

34:45.501 --> 34:47.544
Am I wrong?

34:53.300 --> 34:56.762
He's not yet, um...

34:56.804 --> 34:58.889
I don't know the word.

34:58.931 --> 35:01.642
Une goule.

35:01.683 --> 35:05.729
It is almost like a monster.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.190
But it's worse than a monster.

35:08.232 --> 35:11.318
A ghoul?

35:11.360 --> 35:13.987
A ghoul.

35:14.029 --> 35:18.325
He's not yet a ghoul.

35:18.367 --> 35:21.119
Please help me apprehend the man
who's changing him.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.140
(phone chimes)

35:59.783 --> 36:01.994
-I'm sorry.
-What?

36:02.035 --> 36:06.206
I'm sorry, I just forgot
what's going on.

36:06.248 --> 36:08.125
Everything's going on.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.793
It's okay.

-Hey.
-Hey.

John.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.599
It's all right.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.933
I'll be all right.
