00:05.048 --> 00:07.808
I'm arresting you for conspiracy
to murder a protected witness.

00:08.229 --> 00:10.389
You've been talking to AC-12.

00:12.869 --> 00:14.068
What is it?

00:14.069 --> 00:15.148
Tracking device.

00:15.149 --> 00:18.068
We were investigating Denton. It
didn't matter what route she took -

00:18.069 --> 00:19.789
the ambushers were tracking Akers!

00:22.269 --> 00:24.788
The records show that
Superintendent Hastings

00:24.789 --> 00:27.468
is in considerable
financial difficulties.

00:27.469 --> 00:29.188
I'd like you to carry on.

00:29.189 --> 00:30.908
Very grateful, sir. Thank you, sir.

00:30.909 --> 00:33.228
If I was to put myself forward
for promotion,

00:33.229 --> 00:35.909
this particular officer
more or less tipped me the wink.

00:38.389 --> 00:41.788
'We had a deal.
Immunity from prosecution.

00:41.789 --> 00:43.348
'You two-faced bastard.'

00:43.349 --> 00:47.569
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden -
Tommy's "two-faced bastard".

00:51.189 --> 00:53.708
'He's been one of us
since he was a wee laddie.

00:53.709 --> 00:57.468
'He's been doing
a job on the inside for years.'

00:57.469 --> 00:59.589
Mind if I look into that, sir?

01:02.069 --> 01:03.348
Carly Kirk?

01:03.349 --> 01:04.548
No ID yet.

01:04.549 --> 01:06.588
Her face
and finger-pulps were burnt off.

01:06.589 --> 01:09.348
The detective came to the house
and took the stuff you said.

01:09.349 --> 01:10.669
That's him.

01:14.509 --> 01:15.829
Nurse? Where's the...?

01:17.829 --> 01:19.749

Don't be alarmed, ma'am.

01:51.149 --> 01:52.429
Out.

02:04.509 --> 02:07.388
You've been in custody.
You've been interviewed.

02:07.389 --> 02:08.508
What've you told them?

02:10.109 --> 02:11.989
Nothing. Christ's sake.

02:13.269 --> 02:15.469
What have you told them? Nothing.

02:43.309 --> 02:45.588
We know you've been
cooperating with AC-12.

02:45.589 --> 02:47.628
The prison officers
burning your hands -

02:47.629 --> 02:49.549
that didn't get the message over?

02:50.829 --> 02:53.469
OK. I'm going to ask you again.
What've you told them?

02:55.069 --> 02:56.109
Nothing.

03:01.669 --> 03:03.109
Now it gets serious.

03:04.149 --> 03:06.148
What've you told them?

03:06.149 --> 03:07.988
D-Dryden. Speak up!

03:07.989 --> 03:10.069
Mike Dryden. Set the whole thing up.

03:11.549 --> 03:12.709
We're listening.

03:14.429 --> 03:17.068
That's all I said...
That's all I said to AC-12.

03:17.069 --> 03:19.349
Jesus Christ, Manny,
let's just do her.

03:23.629 --> 03:26.308
I've done one female copper.
Don't think I won't do another.

03:26.309 --> 03:27.589
It's the truth!

03:29.469 --> 03:32.148
They've charged you, remanded you.
What've they got on you?

03:32.149 --> 03:33.509
Dryden set me up!

03:35.749 --> 03:36.868
Last chance.

03:36.869 --> 03:38.229
It's the truth!

03:53.269 --> 03:55.668
You don't recognise him?

03:55.669 --> 03:59.548
Whatever. He's been a liability
ever since the e-fit came out.

03:59.549 --> 04:02.509
Now get in the car! GET IN THE CAR!

04:07.349 --> 04:11.148
You're a liability, too,
unless you start telling the truth.

04:11.149 --> 04:12.668
Think about it, yeah.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.029
GET IN!

04:34.229 --> 04:36.628
Right, that's the prison officers
away. They look fine.

04:36.629 --> 04:39.188
What about Denton? We don't know
whether she was kidnapped.

04:39.189 --> 04:41.268
Or they were springing her
from custody.

04:41.269 --> 04:43.148
'All patrols, all patrols,
repeat,

04:43.149 --> 04:45.188
'Lindsay Denton
has escaped from custody.

04:45.189 --> 04:48.788
'Denton is known to employ
misrepresentation and deceit.'

04:48.789 --> 04:50.628
Well, I couldn't have put it
better myself.

04:50.629 --> 04:52.748
Right, well, get out there
and find her. Yes, sir.

04:52.749 --> 04:53.868
"Yes, sir." "Yes, sir."

04:53.869 --> 04:55.629
God help us all if we've lost her.

05:19.109 --> 05:21.588
'Hello, Police.'

05:21.589 --> 05:24.228
This is
DS Manish Prasad, Polk Avenue Vice.

05:24.229 --> 05:25.828
We've just sighted DI Denton.

05:25.829 --> 05:27.868
DC Cole was in pursuit
but I've lost him.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.388
'What is your location?'
I'm going after them!

05:30.389 --> 05:31.429
'DS Prasad?'

06:07.949 --> 06:09.148
I need an ambulance.

06:09.149 --> 06:11.468
Yeah, sure. You pass me the phone.

06:11.469 --> 06:12.628
It's in my pocket.

06:12.629 --> 06:15.549
I'm not going to reach for it.
You want an ambulance, you pass it.

06:28.709 --> 06:31.068
We'll get to the ambulance
in a minute.

06:31.069 --> 06:35.068
First, when I turn this on,
you're going to record a statement.

06:35.069 --> 06:39.748
Dryden, the ambush, and me.
You got it?

06:39.749 --> 06:41.628
If I talk, I'm a dead man.

06:41.629 --> 06:45.108
Maybe you are anyway. So talk.

06:45.109 --> 06:46.708
Please. Call an ambulance.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.309
Why'd they use you for the job?

06:52.109 --> 06:53.788
They had stuff on me and Cole.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.668
He's Cole?

06:55.669 --> 06:57.788
Jez - J-Jeremy Cole.

06:57.789 --> 06:59.228
What kind of stuff?

06:59.229 --> 07:01.228
We're Vice. Use your imagination.

07:01.229 --> 07:02.348
And Dryden?

07:02.349 --> 07:03.389
Him too.

07:04.629 --> 07:05.989
So, there's the story.

07:07.629 --> 07:09.709
That's why Dryden set up the ambush.

07:10.949 --> 07:12.748
The suspect has asked me

07:12.749 --> 07:15.628
to record what he believes
is his dying declaration

07:15.629 --> 07:17.948
following his receiving
life-threatening injuries

07:17.949 --> 07:19.668
in a road traffic collision

07:19.669 --> 07:23.108
and finding himself in the hopeless
expectation of death.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.588
State your name.

07:24.589 --> 07:27.028
You really think you're going
to get out of this?

07:27.029 --> 07:28.189
Not going to happen!

07:29.989 --> 07:34.028
You killed Wallis and Butler!
Your mate killed Georgia Trotman!

07:34.029 --> 07:35.709
All police, all innocent!

07:48.029 --> 07:49.149
Please!

08:00.469 --> 08:01.589
Now talk.

08:05.149 --> 08:07.229
DS Manish Prasad.

08:09.869 --> 08:11.508
In the hope...

08:11.509 --> 08:13.988
hopeless expectation of death,

08:13.989 --> 08:15.989
I record my dying declaration.

08:22.149 --> 08:24.188
'Sighting of Lindsay Denton,

08:24.189 --> 08:26.869
'identifying cell of caller's phone,
stand by for location.'

08:28.469 --> 08:29.828
DS Arnott.

08:29.829 --> 08:30.948
'This is Lindsay Denton.

08:30.949 --> 08:33.388
'I've detained the two gunmen
who carried out the ambush.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.948
'They're in a bad way so I've
recorded a dying declaration.'

08:35.948 --> 08:37.188
Where are you?

08:37.188 --> 08:39.269
'Check your inbox
for the audio file.'

08:41.749 --> 08:43.347
It's here. Got it.

08:43.349 --> 08:45.868
'The old Highpoint Building.
I'm keeping this phone on.

08:45.869 --> 08:48.068
'They can triangulate
to this position.'

08:48.069 --> 08:49.828
Lindsay? Lindsay?

08:49.829 --> 08:52.309
Highpoint's over in Moss Heath.
You need to make a U...

10:06.269 --> 10:08.028
Two bodies. Ready to approach.

10:08.029 --> 10:11.588
Thank you.
Right, I want this scene secure.

10:11.589 --> 10:14.868
Right now, somebody evidence
and secure this phone.

10:14.869 --> 10:18.789
Paramedics, on my authority, you're
free to enter the crime scene.

10:20.389 --> 10:21.549
Thank you.

10:24.949 --> 10:26.308
Is he dead? Yeah.

10:26.309 --> 10:28.668
Right, on my authority,
check that body. Thank you.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.228
Denton's on foot, sir.
She can't have got far.

10:31.229 --> 10:32.828
Yes, Kate. Put out obs. Sir.

10:32.829 --> 10:34.668
Boss, I got an idea,
OK if I check it out?

10:34.669 --> 10:35.989
Yes, off you go, Steve.

10:42.229 --> 10:43.388
This one's still alive!

10:43.389 --> 10:45.828
I want to stay with him, sir.
Keep hold of firearm units.

10:45.829 --> 10:47.508
Make sure he gets
to hospital safely.

10:47.509 --> 10:49.508
Agreed. Agreed, Kate,
good idea, good idea.

10:49.509 --> 10:51.229
Dot, you're with her, all right.
Sir.

10:57.349 --> 11:00.509
Right, come on, we've got
to get this cordon sorted out!

11:06.509 --> 11:08.148
Kate.

11:08.149 --> 11:10.189
'Steve. Prasad's still alive.'

11:12.029 --> 11:13.429
Received.

11:19.869 --> 11:21.388
She's in her mother's room.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.829
Keep out for now.

11:25.669 --> 11:26.828
Just arrived.

11:26.829 --> 11:29.948
Nobody approach her,
just stay on the line!

11:29.949 --> 11:32.028
You the nurse I was talking to? Yes.

11:32.029 --> 11:34.308
Where is she? Last door on the left.

11:34.309 --> 11:37.909
You hear any commotion,
you call 999 straight away. OK.

11:40.829 --> 11:42.069
Lindsay?

11:43.909 --> 11:46.108
It's Steve Arnott.

11:46.109 --> 11:47.989
I'd like to come in, if that's OK?

11:53.149 --> 11:54.749
Lindsay, I'm coming in now.

12:28.469 --> 12:30.109
I'm very sorry for your loss.

12:34.909 --> 12:36.429
I should've been with her.

12:40.709 --> 12:43.949
We can arrange for you to see her,
if that's what you want.

12:45.749 --> 12:47.829
They've already stripped her room.

12:51.189 --> 12:52.989
Her things were very personal.

12:54.749 --> 12:56.308
They mustn't lose them.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.109
No, of course,
they've got to be returned to you.

13:04.549 --> 13:06.069
How did you know I was here?

13:09.589 --> 13:10.789
She was your mum.

13:21.989 --> 13:23.109
I'll come now.

13:25.589 --> 13:27.749
Take as long as you need.

13:28.749 --> 13:29.989
I'll just be outside.

13:31.109 --> 13:32.149
Thank you.

14:01.149 --> 14:03.028
Well, let's hope he lives.

14:03.029 --> 14:05.948
It's not whether he lives,
it's whether he'll talk.

14:05.949 --> 14:08.108
Do you think he will? He's got to.

14:08.109 --> 14:10.389
Chances are this arsehole's
the Caddy.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.948
Look. I know what the crime scene
must look like.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.588
What happened?

14:27.589 --> 14:30.588
I was just defending myself.
I only meant to immobilise him.

14:30.589 --> 14:32.028
You succeeded.

14:32.029 --> 14:34.589
Don't make light of it.
It was horrible.

14:37.949 --> 14:39.269
What happened to Cole?

14:40.629 --> 14:41.989
Prasad murdered him.

14:44.669 --> 14:47.309
Tell me something. Copper to copper.

14:48.749 --> 14:49.789
Cole...

14:51.309 --> 14:53.989
..was he definitely the one
that killed Georgia?

14:55.469 --> 14:58.349
Yeah. He confessed.

15:21.309 --> 15:23.748
You listened to the whole
declaration Prasad made?

15:23.749 --> 15:24.829
No, not yet.

15:25.989 --> 15:27.989
Dryden ordered the ambush, Steve.

15:29.789 --> 15:31.108
With Cole and Prasad dead,

15:31.109 --> 15:33.548
how do you propose to build
a case against Dryden?

15:33.549 --> 15:35.108
We'll manage.

15:35.109 --> 15:38.868
The fact that he's Deputy Chief
Constable - that's not an issue, no?

15:38.869 --> 15:41.028
He's been accused of lying
about a driving offence

15:41.029 --> 15:42.548
and it's all just melted away,

15:42.549 --> 15:45.588
it's nothing to do
with him being the DCC?

15:45.589 --> 15:47.589
Where's it all coming from, Steve?

15:48.629 --> 15:49.669
Hastings, right?

15:50.669 --> 15:54.748
Every rank above DCI
is more politician than policeman.

15:54.749 --> 15:56.948
Hastings isn't daft enough
to take Dryden on.

15:56.949 --> 15:58.268
You really don't know the man.

15:58.269 --> 16:01.108
No. I think I know you, though.

16:01.109 --> 16:02.428
Do you?

16:02.429 --> 16:06.548
Dryden ordered the killings
of four police officers

16:06.549 --> 16:08.149
and one of them was Georgia.

16:47.109 --> 16:49.788
Dot, Kate, come with me.

16:49.789 --> 16:51.749
The rest of you, back to your work.

16:55.069 --> 16:58.188
No-one present at the High Point
crime scene should enter this room

16:58.189 --> 17:00.268
to prevent forensic
cross-contamination.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.348
Is she under arrest and cautioned?

17:02.349 --> 17:05.028
For what?
Escape from lawful custody.

17:05.029 --> 17:06.108
I was kidnapped.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.468
Yes, well, we'll let a court
determine that, shall we?

17:08.469 --> 17:11.108
They weren't springing her, sir.
They were going to kill her.

17:11.108 --> 17:12.867
Kate, will you do that, anyway?

17:12.868 --> 17:14.268
Yes, sir. Mm-hm.

17:14.269 --> 17:16.228
We'll also need your clothes
for forensics.

17:16.229 --> 17:18.508
Nothing personal,
you understand, it's procedure.

17:18.509 --> 17:19.867
We'll have a doctor look at you,

17:19.868 --> 17:21.867
and in the meantime,
we'll take care of you.

17:21.868 --> 17:24.748
Kate, you get a female officer
to recover her clothes, yeah. Sir.

17:24.749 --> 17:26.068
No, no. Not you.

17:26.069 --> 17:27.548
We want your clothes as well.

17:27.549 --> 17:30.028
There's an audio file, sir.
You'll hear she's innocent.

17:30.029 --> 17:31.708
Yes, and I will listen to it.

17:31.709 --> 17:34.348
When you're done here,
you place her in protective custody

17:34.349 --> 17:36.589
in a random police station
under a false ID.

17:40.509 --> 17:41.589
Kate.

17:43.749 --> 17:47.428
Lindsay Denton, you're to be charged
with escape from lawful custody.

17:47.429 --> 17:50.509
Do you require any legal
representation at this time?

17:52.549 --> 17:53.629
OK.

18:09.429 --> 18:12.108
'DS Manish Prasad.

18:12.109 --> 18:16.148

Sorry, gaffer, I didn't think
this could wait any longer

18:37.149 --> 18:38.988
now we've got the dying declaration.

18:38.989 --> 18:41.269
You've seen these images from CCTV.

18:42.389 --> 18:46.548
The lip-reader's analysed the tape.
Nothing incriminating, just banter.

18:46.549 --> 18:50.028
But Dryden and Prasad
appear to be on friendly terms.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.948
Looking at their personnel records,

18:51.949 --> 18:56.108
Dryden was Department Head at Vice
when Prasad joined as a DC.

18:56.109 --> 18:57.628
They knew each other well, sir.

18:57.629 --> 19:00.429
From the CCTV, you'd go
so far as to call them mates.

19:01.909 --> 19:05.388
That's 15-year-old misper
Carly Kirk, also at the function.

19:05.389 --> 19:08.148
We've contacted the catering company
and they've got no record

19:08.149 --> 19:10.708
to say that she was
an employee of theirs that night.

19:10.709 --> 19:11.988
She was known to Prasad

19:11.989 --> 19:14.469
and we believe this is the last time
she was seen alive.

19:16.869 --> 19:19.708
Yeah, good work, very good work.
Well done.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.109
Sir. Sir.

19:37.269 --> 19:39.029
He said to go straight in.

19:43.389 --> 19:45.228
Gone to ground, Ted?

19:45.229 --> 19:48.068
My office has been asking all day
for you to report.

19:48.069 --> 19:52.028
Ah, you'll have to forgive me, sir,
I was just making sure of my facts.

19:52.029 --> 19:53.509
Well, let's have them.

19:54.829 --> 19:56.428
We've got the gunmen, sir.

19:56.429 --> 20:00.389
One recorded confessing to the
ambush, and naming his accomplice.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.668
Well, that's fantastic work, Ted.

20:04.669 --> 20:06.389
I want to hear that recording.

20:08.349 --> 20:09.828
All in good time, sir.

20:09.829 --> 20:11.749
Er, this is a joint operation...

20:13.389 --> 20:15.308
I will not disclose any leads to

20:15.309 --> 20:19.109
Detective Chief Superintendent
Hargreaves, sir, and that is final.

20:20.909 --> 20:22.149
Give us a minute, Les.

20:24.189 --> 20:25.229
Les!

20:34.829 --> 20:37.228
Do I have to drag it out of you,
Ted?

20:37.229 --> 20:40.668
The two gunmen are or were
serving detectives

20:40.669 --> 20:42.309
assigned to Vice, sir.

20:48.989 --> 20:51.749
Well... That is a matter
of great sensitivity.

20:53.989 --> 20:56.669
It's the right thing to do...
to keep a lid on it.

20:58.989 --> 21:00.348
Who-Who were they?

21:00.349 --> 21:02.908
I'd rather not say, sir,
I'm still gathering information.

21:02.909 --> 21:04.748
There's those two plus Akers.

21:04.749 --> 21:06.029
And Denton, of course.

21:07.869 --> 21:10.788
Of course, there may be others, sir,
involved in the conspiracy,

21:10.789 --> 21:12.509
others yet to be identified.

21:18.749 --> 21:20.869
Well. Very good. Very good.

21:26.189 --> 21:29.028
Being indiscreet for a moment,

21:29.029 --> 21:32.428
you could be looking at
a promotion here, Ted...

21:32.429 --> 21:33.709
assuming you want it.

21:39.109 --> 21:41.108
It's a team effort, sir.

21:41.109 --> 21:43.149
Oh, none of that false modesty.

21:44.189 --> 21:46.188
Denise said to come straight in.

21:46.189 --> 21:47.468
Absolutely.

21:47.469 --> 21:50.028
It's a shame you can't appear
in front of camera,

21:50.029 --> 21:52.308
but stick around
for the press conference.

21:52.309 --> 21:53.548
Press conference, sir?

21:53.549 --> 21:55.148
What did I say about false modesty?

21:55.149 --> 21:57.668
This is the breakthrough
we've been desperate for.

21:57.669 --> 22:00.468
If you'll excuse us, Ted?

22:00.469 --> 22:01.589
Sir.

22:04.989 --> 22:06.548
Sorry to keep you.

22:06.549 --> 22:07.988
Dr Kaur will see you now,

22:07.989 --> 22:11.748
and then the burns specialist will
come and have a look at your hands.

22:11.749 --> 22:13.068
I'll wait here.

22:13.069 --> 22:14.269
Thanks.

22:24.909 --> 22:28.029
Dr Kaur wants her notes downloaded.
She was seen earlier this year.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.229
All right. All right.

23:15.589 --> 23:17.428
You want one, sir?

23:17.429 --> 23:20.988
Or have you packed up
now you've gone squeaky clean?

23:20.989 --> 23:23.868
I have packed up, as it happens.

23:23.869 --> 23:27.588
It's another thing you can act
superior about then, sir.

23:27.589 --> 23:30.509
We're off duty, mate.
It's still "Dot".

23:33.309 --> 23:34.549
How can I help you, sir?

23:35.709 --> 23:38.669
Look. It's all about information
in this game.

23:40.389 --> 23:42.068
I was hoping you could help me out

23:42.069 --> 23:45.468
with some information
about a certain Executive Officer.

23:45.469 --> 23:47.868
You're asking the wrong bloke.

23:47.869 --> 23:49.668
Aforementioned Executive Officer

23:49.669 --> 23:53.588
had his name splashed all over
the papers for his wife's SP30.

23:53.589 --> 23:57.148
A paper you used to throw
the odd titbit every now and then,

23:57.149 --> 23:58.468
if I remember right.

23:58.469 --> 23:59.668
No comment.

23:59.669 --> 24:01.028
Look, it's no skin off my nose

24:01.029 --> 24:03.148
if you're making
a bit of extra holiday pay.

24:03.149 --> 24:07.108
Perk of the job. What counts
is what happened with Dryden.

24:07.109 --> 24:09.188
What really happened that night?

24:09.189 --> 24:12.308
You're in AC five minutes, you think
it's all right to grass on your own.

24:12.309 --> 24:14.589
Dryden - one of our own?

24:15.909 --> 24:20.468
What... he's having posh lunches with
the PCC and shagging on expenses.

24:20.469 --> 24:22.109
We don't owe him anything, mate.

24:23.189 --> 24:25.468
Well, if it's a choice
between sticking it to an Exec

24:25.469 --> 24:28.389
or sticking it to AC,
I'll have to think about it.

24:30.429 --> 24:32.149
This is all off record.

24:33.229 --> 24:34.908
Come on...

24:34.909 --> 24:37.029
help me stick it
to that smug bastard.

24:41.069 --> 24:44.228
What I heard was
it was going round wife to wife.

24:44.229 --> 24:47.308
She was in a state about the SP30,
terrified about the embarrassment.

24:47.309 --> 24:49.428
Then, all of a sudden...

24:49.429 --> 24:53.148
it wasn't her who was driving,
it was him.

24:53.149 --> 24:54.629
So what was he up to?

24:56.949 --> 24:58.508
You got it from Vice.

24:58.509 --> 25:00.428
You never heard it from me.

25:00.429 --> 25:01.629
Scout's honour.

25:04.709 --> 25:05.989
He likes 'em young.

25:09.109 --> 25:11.268
You got a name you can throw me
from Vice?

25:11.269 --> 25:12.588
There is a lad. Mouthy.

25:12.589 --> 25:13.669
Jez Cole.

25:15.469 --> 25:16.709
Jez Cole.

25:18.549 --> 25:19.989
Jeremy Cole?

25:25.869 --> 25:28.948
Yeah, I've...
I've heard they call him The Caddy.

25:28.949 --> 25:31.228
I'll have to
take your word for that.

25:31.229 --> 25:32.549
Will you, though?

25:34.229 --> 25:35.788
What?

25:35.789 --> 25:38.588
Look, if you think
you've got it bad, you should try AC.

25:38.589 --> 25:40.988
The bean-counters are
all over you for everything.

25:40.989 --> 25:42.788
But I need to get this box ticked.

25:42.789 --> 25:46.509
All you have to do is say you've
heard this nickname used for Cole.

25:49.389 --> 25:52.429
It'll make it easier to keep
your name out the Dryden saga.

25:53.749 --> 25:55.708
I don't think the DCC'd
be best pleased

25:55.709 --> 25:58.389
to find out who'd splashed his name
all over the papers.

26:02.709 --> 26:04.149
But it won't come to that.

26:06.069 --> 26:07.909
For old times' sake.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.428
Apparently Cole
likes to wear golf jumpers

26:13.429 --> 26:14.868
but he's never played the game.

26:14.869 --> 26:17.029
Hence, the Caddy.

26:20.469 --> 26:21.549
Nige?

26:23.189 --> 26:24.349
Nice one.

26:50.869 --> 26:52.029
How is he?

26:53.109 --> 26:54.309
Stable.

26:58.189 --> 27:00.708
When he talks, we'll know the truth.

27:00.709 --> 27:01.949
He's already talked.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.309
Under extreme duress.

27:07.229 --> 27:08.749
Have you told Lindsay he's alive?

27:10.109 --> 27:11.189
No.

27:13.069 --> 27:14.269
Good.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.908
You should get off home.

27:24.909 --> 27:26.588
I'm going to stay.

27:26.589 --> 27:28.669
I want to be here
when he comes round.

27:33.189 --> 27:36.228
All right. Night.

27:36.229 --> 27:37.389
Night.

28:13.629 --> 28:14.829
Steve...

28:16.549 --> 28:18.908
Give us a minute, will you?

28:18.909 --> 28:20.348
Cheers.

28:20.349 --> 28:21.908
I don't suppose you've got any idea

28:21.909 --> 28:24.348
what it's like to be locked up
24 hours a day, have you?

28:24.349 --> 28:27.708
I'm sorry. Hold me on
the original conspiracy charge

28:27.709 --> 28:30.908
but please let me
make a second bail application.

28:30.909 --> 28:33.469
Please, Steve,
I can't be locked up any more.

29:14.709 --> 29:18.068
Your Honour, the defendant wishes
to make a second bail application.

29:18.069 --> 29:19.348
I'll hear it.

29:19.349 --> 29:21.548
The defendant has proved
she's not a flight risk

29:21.549 --> 29:24.388
by willingly surrendering herself
into police custody.

29:24.389 --> 29:27.188
She's also fully cooperating
with Anti-Corruption Unit 12

29:27.189 --> 29:30.388
in their further inquiries into
the murders of three police officers

29:30.389 --> 29:31.589
on the 5th September.

29:32.989 --> 29:34.309
Ms Latimer?

29:36.829 --> 29:40.148
Your Honour, the prosecution
no longer opposes bail

29:40.149 --> 29:42.588
subject to the defendant
surrendering her passport

29:42.589 --> 29:44.508
and residing at her home address,

29:44.509 --> 29:46.828
this being monitored
by an electronic tag.

29:46.829 --> 29:50.268
This is on the basis, Your Honour,
that the defendant

29:50.269 --> 29:53.749
continues to cooperate fully
with Anti-Corruption Unit 12.

29:56.429 --> 30:00.549
From what I've heard, bail is granted
subject to these conditions.

30:27.149 --> 30:30.268
Someone could've put the heating on.

30:30.269 --> 30:32.908
I need a shower
and a change of clothes.

30:32.909 --> 30:35.148
The, er... the base unit...

30:35.149 --> 30:37.388
Yep, will alert you
if I run off into the night.

30:37.389 --> 30:40.788
A uniformed officer will remain
outside. Is that overkill?

30:40.789 --> 30:42.228
For your protection.

30:42.229 --> 30:43.589
Right. Yeah. Thanks.

30:47.269 --> 30:48.549
Great!

30:58.589 --> 31:00.828
I don't suppose
you've got any ketchup?

31:00.829 --> 31:03.308
Must've left it with
the pickled onions and mushy peas.

31:03.309 --> 31:05.469
Are you being sarcastic? A bit.

31:06.629 --> 31:08.348
I've just had my fill recently

31:08.349 --> 31:11.788
of people speaking to me
in a mean-spirited way, that's all.

31:11.789 --> 31:12.989
Sorry.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.468
What happened to the cat?

31:17.469 --> 31:20.029
Taken to a home
when I got put on remand.

31:21.589 --> 31:23.348
Will you be able to get it back?

31:23.349 --> 31:26.428
Her. She's been adopted.

31:26.429 --> 31:28.708
Sorry, I didn't mean to...
It's all right.

31:28.709 --> 31:31.068
Probably thought it was just a cat.

31:31.069 --> 31:33.868
Mike was the same. He was allergic.

31:33.869 --> 31:36.468
He said we could never move in
together if I kept a cat.

31:36.469 --> 31:38.589
My previous cat. You got rid of it?

31:39.709 --> 31:42.069
Well, I... I thought
he would move in.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.348
You must hate him for it.

31:46.349 --> 31:48.789
Like you said, it was just a cat.

31:49.869 --> 31:51.468
I didn't say that.

31:51.469 --> 31:54.348
Well, I'm home.

31:54.349 --> 31:56.508
I'm semi-free.

31:56.509 --> 31:57.828
And you got wine.

31:57.829 --> 32:00.708
Thought after all you'd been through
it'd take the edge off.

32:00.709 --> 32:02.149
Yeah. You thought right.

32:03.669 --> 32:05.308
Do you want one?

32:05.309 --> 32:06.349
Better not.

32:07.429 --> 32:08.828
Well...

32:08.829 --> 32:11.069
if you don't drink it, I will.

32:12.149 --> 32:14.309
Can't jail me for that, can they?

32:15.309 --> 32:16.749
Cheers.

32:30.709 --> 32:31.989
Prasad's not dead.

32:35.509 --> 32:39.149
He's in a bad way right now,
but there's every chance he'll talk.

32:41.629 --> 32:42.949
Good.

32:45.389 --> 32:47.828
I really better leave you
to settle in.

32:47.829 --> 32:49.269
Thanks.

33:07.789 --> 33:10.748
We have on record
your dying declaration,

33:10.749 --> 33:14.908
made when you were under
the hopeless expectation of death,

33:14.909 --> 33:18.068
testifying to the fact that
you carried out the ambush,

33:18.069 --> 33:20.388
in concert with DC Jeremy Cole,

33:20.389 --> 33:23.628
and under the orders of Deputy
Chief Constable Michael Dryden.

33:23.629 --> 33:25.668
Now, is all this true?

33:25.669 --> 33:28.429
Whether it's true or false
is irrelevant.

33:29.509 --> 33:32.828
It was obtained under duress,
so it's inadmissible in court.

33:32.829 --> 33:35.628
Well, we've got a pile of evidence
that is admissible.

33:35.629 --> 33:38.788
Kidnap, attempted murder,

33:38.789 --> 33:41.228
murder, conspiracy,

33:41.229 --> 33:43.068
perverting the course of justice,

33:43.069 --> 33:44.868
sexual activity with a child.

33:44.869 --> 33:47.789
You are going down
for a long time, fella.

33:49.549 --> 33:53.348
And I'm looking at three muppets
who know I'm their best witness.

33:53.349 --> 33:54.709
Jesus.

33:56.589 --> 33:59.588
Let's talk about
this 15-year-old girl.

33:59.589 --> 34:00.868
Carly Kirk.

34:00.869 --> 34:03.948
We have witnesses telling us
that you were her boyfriend.

34:03.949 --> 34:06.028
You mopped up the DNA
control samples

34:06.029 --> 34:09.868
from her foster parents' home
so her body couldn't be identified.

34:09.869 --> 34:13.109
That your idea, Manish,
or was it Dryden's?

34:14.708 --> 34:16.109
Did Dryden kill her?

34:17.668 --> 34:19.788
I request immunity from prosecution

34:19.789 --> 34:22.628
and enrolment in
a witness protection programme.

34:22.629 --> 34:25.428
Look, we have you on tape
at a City Hall function

34:25.429 --> 34:27.029
with Dryden and Carly Kirk.

34:30.309 --> 34:31.467
Immunity.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.228
What were the three of you
doing there together?

34:35.469 --> 34:36.909
Immunity.

34:56.509 --> 34:59.469
Steve.
There's summat you need to see.

35:02.269 --> 35:04.708
This was found in the boot
of Prasad's private car,

35:04.709 --> 35:06.029
under the spare wheel.

35:07.349 --> 35:09.828
So the night we're interested in
is the 16th August,

35:09.829 --> 35:11.749
the night of the driving offence.

35:16.749 --> 35:18.388
Carly Kirk.

35:18.389 --> 35:20.708
He must've left
the reception with her.

35:20.709 --> 35:22.109
Keep going.

35:27.029 --> 35:28.149
Got the bastard.

35:31.149 --> 35:32.669
Open those last files.

35:41.229 --> 35:42.908
We've got Prasad's dying declaration

35:42.909 --> 35:45.628
it was Dryden who set up the ambush,
and now we have the motive.

35:45.629 --> 35:47.028
These photos were also found.

35:47.029 --> 35:49.548
This appears to be Carly Kirk's body
before it was buried

35:49.549 --> 35:52.349
under the concrete floor
at the industrial unit.

35:59.789 --> 36:01.069
Good work.

36:03.309 --> 36:05.508
Good work, yeah.

36:05.509 --> 36:07.868
There's just one thing
I don't understand here.

36:07.869 --> 36:09.468
If Prasad had these photographs,

36:09.469 --> 36:12.788
to my mind, that makes him part
of the effort to blackmail Dryden.

36:12.789 --> 36:15.188
So what are you saying -
that he just changes sides,

36:15.189 --> 36:17.388
does Dryden's bidding,
and sets up the ambush?

36:17.389 --> 36:20.748
Well, until we get the CPS to agree
to terms on Prasad's immunity,

36:20.749 --> 36:24.509
we're stuck. And we're stuck on
Dryden without Prasad's testimony.

36:29.029 --> 36:30.908
It's too many ifs and buts.

36:30.909 --> 36:33.148
That's why we need to fill in
the gaps with Dryden.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.028
We're past the evidence threshold,
sir.

36:35.029 --> 36:37.228
We can't do much more
without arresting him.

36:37.229 --> 36:40.029
We would've done,
if he weren't the DCC, eh? Yeah.

36:53.669 --> 36:55.228
Do it.

36:55.229 --> 36:56.549
Sir. Sir. Sir.

37:19.749 --> 37:21.148
What's going on?

37:21.149 --> 37:23.228
Would you come with us, please, sir?

37:23.229 --> 37:26.348
Where? We've made an arrangement
with East Midlands.

37:26.349 --> 37:30.189
Superintendent Hastings felt that
was the most sensitive way to proceed.

37:31.469 --> 37:33.349
Work, love. Give us a minute.

37:35.829 --> 37:37.149
Please.

37:43.789 --> 37:46.149
I'm not going to
make this easy for you.

37:48.349 --> 37:51.308
Michael Dryden, you're to
accompany us for questioning.

37:51.309 --> 37:52.868
We're not arresting you at this time

37:52.869 --> 37:56.309
but if you do not comply,
then we will be forced to arrest you.

37:57.629 --> 38:00.549
Get home, the pair of you.
Past your bedtime.

38:02.189 --> 38:04.268
We're not going anywhere, sir,

38:04.269 --> 38:06.429
unless you're coming with us.

38:13.189 --> 38:15.308
Michael Dryden, I am arresting you.

38:15.309 --> 38:18.228
You do not have to say anything but
it may harm your defence if you fail

38:18.229 --> 38:21.068
to mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

38:21.069 --> 38:23.269
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

38:33.349 --> 38:35.908
Hiya. Hi.

38:35.909 --> 38:39.069
Do you want a drink?
No. No, sit down, love.

38:46.669 --> 38:48.188
Is everything OK?

38:48.189 --> 38:49.429
Um...

38:50.829 --> 38:52.309
About the cruise...

38:54.109 --> 38:55.789
I got ahead of myself.

38:58.029 --> 38:59.349
You got my hopes up.

39:00.989 --> 39:02.669
Why, if you couldn't follow through?

39:04.669 --> 39:06.029
It has to do with work.

39:07.589 --> 39:09.428
I had to do the right thing.

39:09.429 --> 39:10.549
Oh.

39:12.389 --> 39:13.988
OK.

39:13.989 --> 39:17.188
Well, as long as YOU got
to do the right thing,

39:17.189 --> 39:18.829
that's OK, then!

39:28.949 --> 39:30.628
Thanks to sterling work

39:30.629 --> 39:33.068
by one of this Force's
most highly specialised units,

39:33.069 --> 39:35.988
the two gunmen responsible
for the 5th of September ambush

39:35.989 --> 39:37.348
are now in our hands.

39:37.349 --> 39:39.948
But this is a momentous day
for this police force,

39:39.949 --> 39:43.708
for the rule of law
and, most importantly,

39:43.709 --> 39:47.709
for the grieving families
of our four fallen comrades.

40:41.709 --> 40:42.909
Thank you.

40:51.429 --> 40:54.828
The format of this interview
is the same with any other suspect.

40:54.829 --> 40:56.348
You no longer have the right

40:56.349 --> 40:59.629
to be questioned by an officer
at least one rank superior.

41:10.189 --> 41:13.588
Interview of Michael Edward Dryden
in the presence of his solicitor

41:13.589 --> 41:15.949
by DS Arnott, DC Fleming.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.308
May I begin, sir?

41:19.309 --> 41:21.308
I've already been in custody
for eight hours.

41:21.309 --> 41:25.028
Think you'd better get a move on.
Clock's ticking.

41:25.029 --> 41:28.828
In respect of the night of 5th
September, the night of the ambush,

41:28.829 --> 41:30.988
you received a phone call
from DI Denton.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.548
We've covered this.

41:32.549 --> 41:35.468
Well, one question
requires further examination.

41:35.469 --> 41:36.908
Prior to the call,

41:36.909 --> 41:40.148
what was your relationship,
if any, with DI Denton?

41:40.149 --> 41:42.268
Two things. One -
there was no relationship.

41:42.269 --> 41:45.348
Two - this lies outside
the parameters of the investigation.

41:45.349 --> 41:48.508
Well, we're at liberty to investigate
any connection to the ambush,

41:48.509 --> 41:51.029
its conspirators
and its alleged conspirators.

41:54.069 --> 41:55.789
You should answer.

42:00.349 --> 42:01.709
May I continue, sir?

42:02.789 --> 42:04.308
Apparently you may.

42:04.309 --> 42:07.828
Did you know her? Yes. We worked
together in Crime Analysis,

42:07.829 --> 42:10.348
a six-month posting,
about five years ago.

42:10.349 --> 42:12.148
DI Denton was on duty that night,

42:12.149 --> 42:14.788
covering for
Inspector Joseph Barlow.

42:14.789 --> 42:18.748
Inspector Barlow was invited by you
to attend a Crime Executive seminar.

42:18.749 --> 42:20.868
By my office, not by me.

42:20.869 --> 42:22.828
The Crime Executive
meets once a month.

42:22.829 --> 42:26.188
We regularly invite officers
of all ranks and specialisations.

42:26.189 --> 42:27.628
If Barlow hadn't been there,

42:27.629 --> 42:30.708
he would've been the Duty Inspector
the night of the ambush, not Denton.

42:30.709 --> 42:33.788
The names come up on a list.
Barlow wasn't cherry-picked.

42:33.789 --> 42:36.868
It's a coincidence. But you accept
as a result of your invitation...

42:36.869 --> 42:39.669
It's a coincidence,
an unfortunate one. Move on.

42:44.469 --> 42:47.389
On the call from DI Denton,
you addressed her as "Linda".

42:48.429 --> 42:50.028
Did I?

42:50.029 --> 42:52.709
According to Denton,
that's what you called her.

42:53.909 --> 42:55.868
I don't get where
you're going with this.

42:55.869 --> 42:58.628
One theory would be that you were
trying to conceal to your wife

42:58.629 --> 43:01.508
that you were receiving a call
from DI Denton. And it'd be wrong.

43:01.509 --> 43:04.508
According to Denton's statement,
when you worked together,

43:04.509 --> 43:07.068
your relationship went
beyond the purely professional.

43:07.069 --> 43:09.588
First half-baked theories,
now innuendo.

43:09.589 --> 43:12.948
You must want to face
a suit for wrongful arrest.

43:12.949 --> 43:14.828
You deny an affair
with Lindsay Denton?

43:14.829 --> 43:15.988
I do.

43:15.989 --> 43:18.588
You deny spending nights
together at her residence,

43:18.589 --> 43:21.188
Queens' Arms Hotel,
among other places?

43:21.189 --> 43:24.709
I strenuously deny
an affair with Lindsay Denton.

43:25.909 --> 43:29.828
An affair isn't necessarily
the same as sexual relations.

43:29.829 --> 43:32.789
Have you had sexual relations
with Lindsay Denton?

43:35.069 --> 43:37.788
I need a definition
of sexual relations.

43:37.789 --> 43:39.309
If I may, sir.

43:43.149 --> 43:45.268
"For the purpose of
this investigation,

43:45.269 --> 43:48.308
"a person engages in sexual
relations when the person knowingly

43:48.309 --> 43:52.148
"engages in, receives or causes
contact with the genitalia, anus,

43:52.149 --> 43:55.268
"groin, breast, inner thigh,
or buttocks of any person

43:55.269 --> 43:58.428
"with an intent to arouse
or gratify sexual desire.

43:58.429 --> 44:00.228
"Contact means intentional touching,

44:00.229 --> 44:02.549
"either directly
or through clothing."

44:06.309 --> 44:10.228
I shagged her a couple of times, she
was a bunny-boiler, and I moved on.

44:10.229 --> 44:12.709
Obviously she wanted there
to be more to it.

44:16.669 --> 44:20.028
Ma'am, if you'd kindly refer
to Document 3 in your folder,

44:20.029 --> 44:21.668
you'll see signed authority

44:21.669 --> 44:24.749
to access your client's
telecommunication records.

44:26.669 --> 44:28.789
I see Superintendent Hastings'
signature.

44:33.189 --> 44:36.308
Sir, if you'd kindly refer
to Document 4 in your folder,

44:36.309 --> 44:40.029
you'll see said records relating
to the 16th August of this year.

44:41.189 --> 44:42.588
I see them.

44:42.589 --> 44:45.948
You'll see a call was made
at 9:33pm from your mobile phone,

44:45.949 --> 44:48.748
lasting approximately 20 seconds.

44:48.749 --> 44:51.428
Do you recognise the number
receiving the call?

44:51.429 --> 44:52.828
No.

44:52.829 --> 44:55.789
This mobile phone
is registered to Lindsay Denton.

44:57.349 --> 44:59.788
I made that call.
What was said in that call?

44:59.789 --> 45:01.148
It was a long time ago.

45:01.149 --> 45:03.828
According to Denton's statement,
you sounded distressed.

45:03.829 --> 45:06.429
Why were you distressed?
I'm sick of her bullshit!

45:16.469 --> 45:19.228
I called Lindsay
because she'd been following me.

45:19.229 --> 45:21.828
Just when I think she's got
the message, there she is again.

45:21.829 --> 45:23.228
Could be a week, could be a month.

45:23.229 --> 45:26.028
But she turns up
and it starts all over again.

45:26.029 --> 45:27.988
You're alleging
she's a stalker, sir?

45:27.989 --> 45:31.108
That's exactly what I'm alleging.
She knows she can get away with it

45:31.109 --> 45:35.108
because there is no way I'm going to
let her have her say about "us".

45:35.109 --> 45:37.348
My wife having to listen to that.

45:37.349 --> 45:39.949
In what way did she
allegedly stalk you that night?

45:41.669 --> 45:43.988
I'm not saying she was there
that particular night.

45:43.989 --> 45:46.868
I'm just saying she had a habit
of turning up and hassling me.

45:46.869 --> 45:49.028
You sure about that? Yes.

45:49.029 --> 45:51.628
Witnesses? Let me tell you
about Lindsay Denton.

45:51.629 --> 45:54.548
She's too smart to
let there be witnesses.

45:54.549 --> 45:57.268
She gets your phone records,
DC Fleming.

45:57.269 --> 46:00.388
Superintendent Hastings,
she gets his financial records.

46:00.389 --> 46:02.948
DS Arnott, she followed you,
took compromising photos.

46:02.949 --> 46:05.429
Did you see her?
Were there any witnesses?

46:07.229 --> 46:11.348
You want to watch her.
She's manipulative and conniving.

46:11.349 --> 46:13.309
You can't trust a word she says.

46:21.989 --> 46:23.389
Can we be clear?

46:24.749 --> 46:27.068
You accept
the phone record is accurate?

46:27.069 --> 46:28.549
As I've said.

46:29.869 --> 46:33.589
I'd be grateful, sir, if you'd refer
to Document 8 in your folder.

46:36.149 --> 46:39.308
Document 8 is a transcript
of part of a previous interview

46:39.309 --> 46:42.468
your client gave us
under Regulation 15 Notice.

46:42.469 --> 46:44.949
A complaint was made
regarding an SP30.

46:46.669 --> 46:50.948
A vehicle registered to Mrs Helen
Dryden was flashed by a speed camera

46:50.949 --> 46:54.589
and a week later Traffic received
notice that you were driving.

46:55.669 --> 47:00.348
From the transcript - "DCC DRYDEN:
I was driving. Helen was home.

47:00.349 --> 47:02.828
"I drove back towards town
to buy some beer and wine

47:02.829 --> 47:06.388
"from the off-licence.
I changed my mind and went home."

47:06.389 --> 47:09.748
Said offence took place on
the evening of the 16th of August.

47:09.749 --> 47:13.388
Your mobile phone record places you
miles away from the speed camera,

47:13.389 --> 47:16.188
making a call to DI Lindsay Denton.

47:16.189 --> 47:18.628
You weren't driving that car.

47:18.629 --> 47:20.868
It says so...

47:20.869 --> 47:22.149
here.

47:33.949 --> 47:37.229
Virtually my whole marriage,
I've worked long hours.

47:39.069 --> 47:40.549
It's taken a toll.

47:44.989 --> 47:48.349
That night,
Helen was at an AA meeting.

47:50.429 --> 47:52.228
She was worried it would get out

47:52.229 --> 47:55.068
if the speeding charge
was taken further.

47:55.069 --> 47:57.388
She made out I was driving
and posted the form.

47:57.389 --> 47:59.468
By the time she told me,
it was too late.

47:59.469 --> 48:01.308
I hoped no-one would ever find out

48:01.309 --> 48:04.069
but some arsehole
leaked it all over the papers.

48:08.509 --> 48:10.748
She was ashamed...

48:10.749 --> 48:12.749
she was attending those meetings.

48:15.469 --> 48:18.548
I'm the one that should be ashamed.

48:18.549 --> 48:19.908
We have information

48:19.909 --> 48:22.709
that your wife had confided
her driving offence to friends.

48:23.909 --> 48:28.068
She had a clean licence,
no chance of being banned.

48:28.069 --> 48:32.068
We don't think that was a good
enough reason for her to lie.

48:32.069 --> 48:35.068
The only reason would be
to provide you with an alibi,

48:35.069 --> 48:37.869
or for you to seize the opportunity
to create one.

48:39.189 --> 48:41.908
I didn't fill in that form.

48:41.909 --> 48:44.308
If I happen to know
it was my wife that did so,

48:44.309 --> 48:46.828
I have no intention
of testifying against her.

48:46.829 --> 48:48.348
The lawyers'll have a field day.

48:48.349 --> 48:51.388
The real villain in all this is
whatever toerag leaked that story,

48:51.389 --> 48:54.228
to bring me down because
the politicians and the PCC

48:54.229 --> 48:57.349
don't like me telling the truth
about service cutbacks.

48:58.469 --> 49:00.788
Why are you talking about
service cutbacks, sir?

49:00.789 --> 49:03.788
I'm trying to get you to
open your eyes, son. They're open.

49:03.789 --> 49:06.988
If you weren't driving your wife's
car, what were you doing that night?

49:06.989 --> 49:09.668
I've answered your questions.
We're done here. We're not.

49:09.669 --> 49:11.628
Where were you that night?
No comment.

49:11.629 --> 49:13.229
Document 10.

49:14.269 --> 49:16.548
Here's a map showing
the mobile phone cell

49:16.549 --> 49:18.788
from which your call
originated that evening.

49:18.789 --> 49:20.388
Please specify your location.

49:20.389 --> 49:22.748
No comment. You were out
in the Edge Park area. Why?

49:22.749 --> 49:23.948
No comment.

49:23.949 --> 49:26.068
DS Manish Prasad and DC Jeremy Cole

49:26.069 --> 49:28.308
carried out the ambush
on September 5th.

49:28.309 --> 49:30.148
Were you meeting with them?

49:30.149 --> 49:32.068
What is this? Are you insane?

49:32.069 --> 49:34.988
Look in your folder. Document 11.

49:34.989 --> 49:37.428
Evidence log
from DCS Hargreaves' team,

49:37.429 --> 49:40.668
re the vehicle used
by DS Jayne Akers during the ambush.

49:40.669 --> 49:45.588
Item 14 - mobile magnetic radio
tracking device.

49:45.589 --> 49:48.908
There was a lump on Akers' vehicle
that allowed the gunmen to track her.

49:48.909 --> 49:51.268
This evidence
was withheld from AC-12.

49:51.269 --> 49:54.668
You knew about this but let us make
a case against Lindsay Denton regardless.

49:54.669 --> 49:57.228
Why did you withhold the evidence?

49:57.229 --> 49:59.388
The investigations
were separate at the time.

49:59.389 --> 50:00.748
It felt like the right way to go.

50:00.749 --> 50:03.388
I didn't keep track of every
little piece of evidence myself.

50:03.389 --> 50:06.468
You were happy for your alleged
stalker to be charged and remanded,

50:06.469 --> 50:09.228
to take the blame for something
she didn't do. You set her up.

50:09.229 --> 50:11.828
She's the one out for revenge!
She's the one out to get me!

50:11.829 --> 50:13.868
She's using you all
and you've fallen for it!

50:13.869 --> 50:15.468
Where were you that night?

50:15.469 --> 50:18.788
Don't go down this road, son.
It doesn't end well.

50:18.789 --> 50:20.788
You got the balls to charge me?

50:20.789 --> 50:22.428
Tick-tock.

50:22.429 --> 50:26.468
As you know, sir, you can be held
in custody for a maximum of 36 hours,

50:26.469 --> 50:29.548
after which you'll either
be charged or released.

50:29.549 --> 50:33.469
We thank you for your cooperation and
we intend to continue. Document 13.

50:37.749 --> 50:39.269
Document 13.

50:42.469 --> 50:45.308
This is a transcript from
a statement you gave to the press

50:45.309 --> 50:49.588
on August 9th. In it, you expressed
disapproval for, in your words,

50:49.589 --> 50:50.948
"repugnant offenders"

50:50.949 --> 50:53.748
who should have their immunity
from prosecution taken away.

50:53.749 --> 50:57.628
One such offender being
John Thomas Hunter, aka Tommy Hunter,

50:57.629 --> 50:59.468
the protected witness.

50:59.469 --> 51:03.868
We have Hunter on tape, stating
his intention to blackmail you.

51:03.869 --> 51:07.188
For the tape, I'm presenting
the suspect with photographs

51:07.189 --> 51:11.669
entered in evidence,
evidence number H86734-D.

51:24.349 --> 51:26.949
Do you recognise
the male in this photograph?

51:30.829 --> 51:32.548
It's... me.

51:32.549 --> 51:33.908
Speak up for the tape.

51:33.909 --> 51:36.108
It's me. And the girl?

51:36.109 --> 51:37.229
Don't know.

51:38.429 --> 51:41.828
For the tape, I'm presenting
the suspect with photographs entered

51:41.829 --> 51:47.549
in evidence, evidence numbers
H86734 dash A to C, dash E to K.

51:59.869 --> 52:01.469
That's you and the female?

52:02.469 --> 52:03.629
Plainly.

52:06.789 --> 52:09.109
What's happening
in these photographs?

52:13.349 --> 52:14.868
Who's the girl?

52:14.869 --> 52:16.268
I don't know.

52:16.269 --> 52:19.228
You appear to know her well enough
in these photos. Appear to.

52:19.229 --> 52:21.348
This is Carly Kirk.

52:21.349 --> 52:23.988
She was seen working
as part of the catering team

52:23.989 --> 52:27.029
at the reception at City Hall
on the 16th of August.

52:28.149 --> 52:30.069
Carly Kirk is 15 years old.

52:35.949 --> 52:37.229
I...

52:39.869 --> 52:41.389
No, um...

52:43.029 --> 52:45.028
She looked older.

52:45.029 --> 52:46.629
How old? 18?

52:52.589 --> 52:57.108
Carly Kirk was a vulnerable young
girl groomed by DS Manish Prasad.

52:57.109 --> 52:59.988
You worked with Prasad in Vice.

52:59.989 --> 53:01.309
Here you are together.

53:02.549 --> 53:05.228
Did Prasad provide you
with young women for sex?

53:05.229 --> 53:06.828
Absolutely not.

53:06.829 --> 53:08.269
Maybe not.

53:10.269 --> 53:11.789
But he knew what you liked.

53:16.909 --> 53:19.908
Did an offence take place
between you and Carly Kirk,

53:19.909 --> 53:23.788
namely sexual activity with a child
under the Sexual Offences Act 2003?

53:23.789 --> 53:27.508
It's not what it looks like.
She never got started. I...

53:27.509 --> 53:29.308
I came to my senses.

53:29.309 --> 53:31.748
Well, why did you let it
get that far?

53:31.749 --> 53:33.228
Why do you think?

53:33.229 --> 53:36.069
Well, I'm not an old perv,
so you'll have to tell me.

53:37.509 --> 53:40.748
I was tempted. For a moment.

53:40.749 --> 53:42.668
And then I chucked her
out of the car.

53:42.669 --> 53:46.948
We believe these photos were used by
John Thomas Hunter to blackmail you.

53:46.949 --> 53:49.428
John Thomas Hunter was
the target of the ambush.

53:49.429 --> 53:50.708
Did you set up the ambush? No!

53:50.709 --> 53:53.508
I never even knew about Hunter,
I never knew about this blackmail!

53:53.509 --> 53:55.708
You turned the tables on Hunter,
had him silenced.

53:55.709 --> 53:58.388
That is not something I would do.
I'm not a criminal.

53:58.389 --> 54:01.068
Well, according to
these photographs, you are.

54:01.069 --> 54:03.669
What does the girl say
is happening in these photos?

54:06.509 --> 54:07.949
What?

54:09.509 --> 54:10.548
For the tape,

54:10.549 --> 54:15.069
I'm presenting the suspect with
photographs H86734 dash L to P.

54:35.909 --> 54:39.188
The point is who she was last
seen with before she disappeared.

54:39.189 --> 54:40.628
Now, wait...

54:40.629 --> 54:43.108
She was murdered.
Do you know who murdered her?

54:43.109 --> 54:44.468
No. Did you murder her? No!

54:44.469 --> 54:46.828
She was strangled.
Do you know who strangled her? No.

54:46.829 --> 54:49.068
Did you strangle her? No.
Her teeth were ripped out.

54:49.069 --> 54:50.828
Her face and finger-pulps
were burnt off

54:50.829 --> 54:52.508
using a high temperature blow-torch.

54:52.509 --> 54:54.268
Do you know who did that to her? No.

54:54.269 --> 54:55.989
Did you do that to her? No!

55:04.229 --> 55:07.228
While you've been in custody, there's
been a search of your residence

55:07.229 --> 55:11.788
and vehicle under Section 18 (1) of
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

55:11.789 --> 55:14.708
Our people were trying to find
clothes that you were wearing

55:14.709 --> 55:17.069
in these photographs.
Why didn't they find any?

55:18.309 --> 55:21.628
I-I don't know. Because you
purposefully disposed of them

55:21.629 --> 55:24.709
to remove any trace of
this girl's DNA and clothes fibres.

55:26.149 --> 55:28.508
I...I must've, um...

55:28.509 --> 55:31.508
I must've had a clear-out
and given them to the charity shop.

55:31.509 --> 55:34.388
Same with your vehicle.
A check round local businesses

55:34.389 --> 55:37.629
reveals you had the car valeted
the very next day. Steam-cleaned.

55:38.829 --> 55:41.748
I didn't want my wife
finding anything...

55:41.749 --> 55:43.708
smelling the girl's cheap perfume.

55:43.709 --> 55:46.868
So you admit taking measures to
conceal evidence you were with her.

55:46.869 --> 55:50.149
Because I got how incriminating
it would be. Funny, that.

55:51.709 --> 55:55.589
You were the last person to see
Carly Kirk before she disappeared.

55:56.949 --> 55:58.548
The last person to see a girl

55:58.549 --> 56:01.628
who's later found buried
under the industrial unit.

56:01.629 --> 56:04.788
There's no evidence I did it.
Look at these photos!

56:04.789 --> 56:07.908
You had Tommy killed to silence him
and you needed to kill Carly, too.

56:07.909 --> 56:10.388
You've got nothing connecting me
to the body. Nothing.

56:10.389 --> 56:11.668
Your career is over, sir.

56:11.669 --> 56:13.988
Possibly your marriage, too.
Why keep up the lies?

56:13.989 --> 56:17.108
I'm not a criminal. I'm an honest
man! You instigated a conspiracy

56:17.109 --> 56:19.308
that led to the deaths
of four police officers.

56:19.309 --> 56:21.589
The only conspiracy is against me!

56:23.669 --> 56:27.228
Hastings! I know you're out there.
You're behind this.

56:27.229 --> 56:29.228
Did they bribe you?

56:29.229 --> 56:32.548
Get you out a mess
you made for yourself?

56:32.549 --> 56:35.508
Hell, that's all going to come out!

56:35.509 --> 56:37.428
You're finished!

56:37.429 --> 56:39.029
YOU'RE FINISHED!

56:41.589 --> 56:43.389
Empty threat, sir.

56:45.789 --> 56:48.388
Michael Edward Dryden,

56:48.389 --> 56:51.308
I hereby inform you that
the senior investigating officer

56:51.309 --> 56:54.148
Superintendent Hastings will be
submitting your case file

56:54.149 --> 56:56.988
to the Crown Prosecutor
for the purpose of seeking authority

56:56.989 --> 56:59.268
to charge you with
the following offences -

56:59.269 --> 57:02.068
murder, conspiracy to murder,

57:02.069 --> 57:06.508
perverting the course of justice,
sexual activity with a child.

57:06.509 --> 57:07.949
I'm innocent.

57:09.749 --> 57:11.469
Someone is setting me up.

57:16.789 --> 57:18.429
Interview terminated.

57:25.869 --> 57:28.549
DI Denton's medical records.
Thank you.

57:31.069 --> 57:32.948
Heads up, you lot.

57:32.949 --> 57:35.068
'..were killed in the ambush
on Long Lane

57:35.069 --> 57:37.508
