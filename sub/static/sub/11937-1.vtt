Wrap some old jeans around
your neck, that'll keep you warm.

That's what your mother would do.

05:18.017 --> 05:20.144
You're right, she would.

05:20.186 --> 05:23.713
The point about this scarf is that

05:23.756 --> 05:27.317
it would become part
of a definition of your...

05:27.360 --> 05:29.453
Of your psyche.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.491

05:32.532 --> 05:34.966
No, I do. Keep talking.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.473

It would make my haircut
look more expensive.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.612
It would be an investment.

05:47.647 --> 05:50.878
You would walk into

- Confident.
- And poised.

05:53.019 --> 05:57.752
- Poised.
- The girl in the green scarf.

05:59.659 --> 06:01.183

06:01.227 --> 06:03.457
Good choice. It's the last one.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.431

How would you like to pay?

06:06.466 --> 06:10.402
Here's $50 in cash,
can you put 30 on this card...

06:15.975 --> 06:17.033
Ten on that.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.736
Twenty on that.

- Declined.

Could you try it again?

- I can't hold sale items.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.699
- Excuse me. It's an emergency.
- [man] Back of the line!

06:46.739 --> 06:50.072
Excuse me, this is an emergency.
Excuse you, excuse me!

06:50.109 --> 06:51.940
- Do you do cash back?
- What?

06:51.978 --> 06:54.276
If I give you a check for $23,
will you give me

06:54.313 --> 06:56.804
one of your hot dogs
and $20 cash back, please?

- Done.

07:22.008 --> 07:24.841
That means you just paid
$23 for a hot dog!

You want your scarf, I want my hot dog.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.540

Is it just mainly
a general chat, hobbies...

09:32.038 --> 09:35.235
Oh, no, no, no.
It's very specific on finance.

Butterfly investments, futures.
That sort of thing.

Oh, it's a naked man. Oh, sorry.

11:00.259 --> 11:03.092
It gave me such a fright. I, uh...

11:03.129 --> 11:05.962
I didn't know what it was.
Clearly, he's beheaded.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.966

11:08.000 --> 11:09.865
[clears throat] Well, a few questions.

11:09.902 --> 11:12.029
But, look! Makes you wonder

what they're looking at
on the fifth floor, right?

11:14.373 --> 11:17.934

I'm sorry, I'm terrible at interviews.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.853
Any financial stories that have
caught your eye recently?

11:33.893 --> 11:36.987
Yes. And I am glad
that you brought that up.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.829
Because I am furious.
No, I really am.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.825
No, I mean, what is the story
with the recent fish crisis?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.201
Fish crisis?

11:46.238 --> 11:49.366
- Fiscal... crisis.
- Fiscal crisis.

11:49.408 --> 11:52.775
- Terrifying. Fiscally, I mean.
- How so?

11:52.812 --> 11:55.042
- For the fiscal family.
- I'm sorry.

11:55.081 --> 11:58.847
- Not a moment too soon.
- Ms. Bloomwood, you dropped your scarf.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.896
She died.

12:13.933 --> 12:19.394
Oh, Ms. Bloomwood, you have had
a very, very tough 25 minutes.

12:19.438 --> 12:23.306
I'm glad you understand!
So many people just... Right.

12:23.342 --> 12:27.301
OK, so I would propose we curtail...

12:27.346 --> 12:28.813
Did you just scrub my name off?

12:28.848 --> 12:31.146
- Oh, no. Routine.
- That seems premature.

12:31.183 --> 12:34.983
OK, I'm gonna propose that
we curtail this interview forthwith.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.318
So I'll leave you and your numbers,

12:37.356 --> 12:40.348
but thank you very much for seeing me,

folding and she knew!

13:11.457 --> 13:14.051
She knew and she didn't tell anybody.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.988
Well, on the bright side,
you hated working for that magazine.

13:19.031 --> 13:22.364
[sighing] It was my income, Suze.
I need my income!

13:22.401 --> 13:25.495
OK, Bex, the most important thing
is not to panic.

13:27.907 --> 13:30.967
- [Suze] Don't answer the phone!
- [both] No!

- The list. Get the list!

13:35.214 --> 13:37.580
- I think I saw it over here.
- Take the lamp!

13:39.185 --> 13:40.652
- It's here!
- Bloomingdale's...

13:40.686 --> 13:43.120
- Hospital for depression.
- Detained in Finland on work.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.645
Visa, dead dog.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.625
All City Debt Collection.
You have to do it.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.787
- Hello! Hi!
- <i>[Derek] Ms. Bloomwood?</i>

13:49.829 --> 13:52.627
- <i>Hello.</i>
- I'm sorry. It's actually not.

13:52.665 --> 13:57.068
She's still recovering from...
You know... OK.

13:57.102 --> 13:59.263
I'll have her call you as soon as...

13:59.305 --> 14:01.671
- <i>Yes?</i>
- As soon as she's come back

14:01.707 --> 14:04.039
- from... From...
- Finland! Finland!

14:04.076 --> 14:06.271
- <i>Clearly she's not too...</i>
- Aah!

14:06.312 --> 14:08.337
[phone clatters]

14:12.451 --> 14:16.148
Why do so many of your excuses
involve Finland?

14:16.188 --> 14:19.089
'Cause no one checks up
on Finland, Tarkie.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.992
How am I going to pay you the rent now?

14:24.029 --> 14:26.190
Well, I'm ripping up your rent check!

14:26.232 --> 14:28.632
No, Suze, you can't do it again.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.999
It's my apartment,
well, my parent's apartment,

14:31.036 --> 14:34.062
- but it's my rules.
- I'm gonna buy you the biggest present.

14:34.106 --> 14:37.633
I am! I know where I'm going to go.
There's a sale at Macy's!

14:37.676 --> 14:39.541
Tarkie...

14:40.312 --> 14:41.836
I'll be at my place.

14:41.881 --> 14:46.580
Thanks, baby. Bex, I'll get
the tequila, you get the bills.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.225
I'll do this. It can't be that bad.

14:53.259 --> 14:56.194
It's just like a Band-Aid.
It's gonna be fine.

14:56.862 --> 14:59.023
[both gasping loudly]

14:59.064 --> 15:03.125
Bex! Two hundred dollars
on Marc Jacobs underwear?

15:03.168 --> 15:06.262
Oh, underwear is a basic human right.

15:06.305 --> 15:08.865
Seventy-eight dollars
on lavender honey!

15:08.908 --> 15:11.706
I felt sorry for the shop assistant.
She had a lazy eye.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.703
I didn't know which way
she was looking. It was so sad.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.807
I can't even talk about this one.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.047
A foot spa? What were you
doing at a foot spa?

15:22.087 --> 15:23.111
Let's take a break.

15:23.155 --> 15:26.352
They said I was a valued customer.

15:26.392 --> 15:29.156
Now they send me hate mail.

15:29.194 --> 15:31.628
- [adding machine rattling]
- [Suze] Bex.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.154
Oh, God...

15:35.200 --> 15:38.260
How are you going to pay off
sixteen thousand twelve hundred

15:38.304 --> 15:43.367
and 62 dollars
and 70 cents with no job?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.339
I could win the lottery.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.639
Maybe you should have a backup plan.

15:52.184 --> 15:56.518
Oh! Backup plan, I got it, I got it.
Backup plan.

15:56.555 --> 16:00.457
OK. When Tarkie
thought of his dream job,

16:00.492 --> 16:05.156
he, um, wrote this proposal
just about him, you know,

16:05.197 --> 16:08.132
what he's made of
and that's what you can do.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.965
You can write a fashion piece
and send it to <i>Alette.</i>

16:11.003 --> 16:12.698
Like, "Hey, <i>Alette,</i> look what I can do!"

16:12.738 --> 16:15.366
You just gotta figure out
what to write about.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.773
"Consider your shoe an investment.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.074
Everything is resting upon it.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.876
The most important point
is that every shoe

16:22.915 --> 16:24.678
should earn its place in your..."

16:24.717 --> 16:27.379
Bex, this is so funny. You're so smart.

16:27.419 --> 16:29.683
- You're the best writer ever!
- Do you like it?

16:29.722 --> 16:31.986
- You're fabulous!
- Wait! Another one.

16:32.024 --> 16:35.619
To that guy at that savings thingy
magazine who didn't hire me.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.526
[laughing]

16:37.563 --> 16:40.123
"Dear Uptight Editor...

16:41.433 --> 16:44.960
- You can stick your job up your ass."
- Man on a bike!

16:45.004 --> 16:46.665
Hello!

16:46.705 --> 16:52.701
"Here's $20. Buy yourself
some decent clothes."

16:54.947 --> 16:56.642
I'm back!

16:56.682 --> 16:59.310
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

16:59.351 --> 17:02.878
This is for <i>Alette</i> magazine.

17:02.921 --> 17:05.013
Please, please. Kiss it for good luck.

17:05.057 --> 17:08.424
- Mwah!
- And this one...

17:08.460 --> 17:10.951
...is for Mr. Successful Saving.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.558
Bleah... Money, money, money.

17:17.301 --> 17:20.931
I better get the job, I've got no money.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.203
[sobbing] I've got no money.

17:23.242 --> 17:27.702
<i># You put the lime in the coconut...</i>

17:27.746 --> 17:30.306
Doesn't this just cheer you up?

17:30.349 --> 17:34.217
- It's not working, Mom.
- Come on, you'll get another job.

17:34.253 --> 17:37.689
Life is like a swap meet.
You never know

17:37.723 --> 17:40.487
when great riches...

17:41.493 --> 17:44.360
...are going to turn up unexpectedly.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.622
What can I get for a quarter?

17:47.666 --> 17:49.429
This!

17:49.468 --> 17:51.026
- <i>Comme ça?</i>
- It's fantastic.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.628
<i>[#</i> Gwen Stefani: <i>Rich Girl</i>

17:52.671 --> 17:56.437
- What are they gettin' for that?
- It's growing on me.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.376
- How much for this?
- Twenty dollars.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.312
- Oh!
- <i>¿Hola?</i>

18:02.347 --> 18:06.477
Um, Rebecca. Luke Brandon,
<i>Successful Saving.</i>

18:06.518 --> 18:07.746
Yes?

18:07.786 --> 18:11.779
Sorry to call so early,
but I got your letter.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.452
And I have to say
it was a bit of a surprise.

18:14.493 --> 18:18.293
Well, I hope I made my point.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.128
Oh, you did. You did. Very well.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.100
The whole metaphor. Very clever.

18:23.135 --> 18:26.468
Yes, wasn't it.
The whole metaphor was...

18:26.505 --> 18:29.633
Wait... What? I'm sorry...

18:29.675 --> 18:32.109
Describing the principles
of security investment

18:32.144 --> 18:35.307
in terms of the way different women
purchase different shoes

18:35.347 --> 18:38.145
was... different.

18:38.183 --> 18:43.018
Hello? Sounds like you might be
in the middle of something.

18:43.055 --> 18:46.081
I was trying to say
that it gave me an idea.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.424
[clears throat] Would you like
to come in? I don't...

18:49.461 --> 18:51.088
Can I help you, dear?

18:51.130 --> 18:54.031
I think I just sent the editor
of <i>Alette</i> magazine $20

18:54.066 --> 18:57.331
to buy herself decent clothes
and stick her job up her ass.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.505
[elevator bell dings]

19:10.816 --> 19:12.841
[grunting]

19:15.687 --> 19:19.123
- [gasps]
- [indistinct chattering]

19:19.158 --> 19:21.752
- These go...
- [elevator bell dings]

19:35.040 --> 19:38.134
- Hey, clothes for Alette.
- [woman] I'll call her assistant.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.839
Hi. Clothes are here
for Alette's approval.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.574
She'll be right out.

19:42.614 --> 19:46.710
What do you think about you and me
going out on Friday night?

19:46.752 --> 19:48.242
- Ooh...
- I mean, if you want to.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.414
Would you like to go out
on Friday night?

19:50.455 --> 19:53.253
I don't know. I might have plans.

19:53.292 --> 19:56.227
You might... Do you
ever wear any of this stuff?

19:56.261 --> 19:58.855
Some of it's a little far out for me.

19:58.897 --> 20:00.524
- Totally far out.
- Yeah.

20:00.566 --> 20:04.332
It's crazy, but I guess that's
the world of high fashion?

20:04.369 --> 20:06.337
- [chuckles] Yes.
- Yeah, I know about that.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.431
I am one of the best. I don't
let this out of my sight.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.772
I guard it with my life.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.608
A lot of pressure on me

20:14.646 --> 20:17.376
to make sure everyone
gets these letters...

20:17.416 --> 20:19.680
- Get them there on time.
- Got to get my job done.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.278
See, I take my job very seriously.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.983
- Yes. And to deliver...
- Oh, really?

20:25.023 --> 20:28.515
And to deliver the mail,
but as the mail carrier

20:28.560 --> 20:31.529
it's a lot of pressure on me
to get people their letters,

20:31.563 --> 20:33.190
I've never lost a letter yet.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.700
[French accent] I want
no more vertical buttonholes.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.395
I'm so bored with vertical buttonholes.

20:37.436 --> 20:40.269
Is this for the <i>Kaleidoscope</i> shoot
with Paolo?

20:40.305 --> 20:46.210
[speaking French]
Oh, but this!

20:46.245 --> 20:50.841
[gasps] Cavalli.
He has read my mind.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.316
It's marvelous. We can use it all.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.445
Take it in.

21:00.058 --> 21:03.926
[Alicia gasps] Oh, God.
What are you doing?

21:03.962 --> 21:07.329
This is <i>Alette.</i>
Is this where you should be?

21:15.007 --> 21:18.101
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

21:18.143 --> 21:22.512
Dantay-West didn't hire me to be
an editor of this magazine.

21:22.547 --> 21:27.177
They hired me to throw it a rope
and pull it out of the swamp.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.948
- [knocking on glass]
- And that's...

21:28.987 --> 21:31.319
Hi, everyone.
I'm Rebecca Bloomwood.

21:31.356 --> 21:32.983
Sit down, Rebecca.

21:37.529 --> 21:41.124
What makes a magazine
move from the newsstands?

21:41.166 --> 21:43.600
[chair squeaking]

21:43.635 --> 21:47.196
Real, unvarnished stories,

21:47.239 --> 21:50.640
whether the people that we are
writing about like them or not.

21:50.676 --> 21:54.339
<i>Successful Saving</i> is currently
the <i>People</i> magazine

21:54.379 --> 21:58.645
of financial journalism,
and this is where that ends.

21:58.684 --> 22:01.244
- From now...
- [pencil sharpener grinding]

22:08.193 --> 22:09.217
Sorry.

22:10.562 --> 22:15.056
From now on
we don't copy, we examine.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.331
- We probe.
- Ooh!

22:20.339 --> 22:23.137
I liked your piece.
I said that on the phone.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.370
- Good. Good.
- Hayley!

22:25.410 --> 22:27.139
What do you say a three-week trial.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.875
- And give her this cubicle.
- Oh, this one's lovely.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.815
They're all three by six.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.410
You can start with a thousand words
on the effect of changing

22:34.453 --> 22:36.318
interest rate on store card APRs.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.289
Good.

22:46.631 --> 22:49.566
[whispers] You still have the label
on your new glasses.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.904
What? Oh.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.533
You took a job
at a savings magazine? You?

22:56.575 --> 22:59.009
I know it sounds bad,
but it is, in fact,

22:59.044 --> 23:01.103
part of a very structured plan.

23:01.146 --> 23:03.205
Yeah, that's great,
but then in a lot of ways

23:03.248 --> 23:05.239
it's kinda not great.
What do they call it

23:05.283 --> 23:08.150
when an animal rights person
gets trampled to death by a cow?

23:08.186 --> 23:10.086
I don't think there is a word for that.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.647
"Ironic." Ironic
that Rebecca Bloomwood

23:12.691 --> 23:14.852
is advising people
on how to handle money.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.925
But I guess it would be nice

23:17.963 --> 23:20.431
if my maid of honor
could afford her own dress.

23:22.501 --> 23:24.332
- He asked?
- Yes!

23:24.369 --> 23:25.859
Oh, my God!
You should've been there.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.462
- How did he say it?
- [man] Hey!

23:27.506 --> 23:31.135
The, uh, credit limit
on your card was reached.

23:33.645 --> 23:37.638
You know, I think I want my husband-
to-be to propose to me in Barneys.

23:37.682 --> 23:41.413
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

23:41.453 --> 23:45.116
- [girl] Yes, you are.
- I just found the perfect book for you.

23:45.157 --> 23:49.787

23:51.163 --> 23:55.691
<i>Do you find yourself</i>
<i>constantly drawn toward stores?</i>

23:55.734 --> 23:57.861
- Yes.
- Nope.

- Yes! This guy's good.
- No.

24:04.910 --> 24:08.971
<i>Did you answer no to these questions</i>
<i>and are consequently in denial?</i>

24:09.014 --> 24:11.107

<i>Did you just say "no" again?</i>

<i>Throw it all out.</i>

<i>Your new mantra is, "Do I need this?"</i>

24:57.496 --> 24:59.054
No.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.563
What's this?

25:01.600 --> 25:05.058
A thousand words
on store card APRs?

25:05.103 --> 25:08.732
Which looks as if it's been copied
straight out of <i>Money for Dummies.</i>

25:10.742 --> 25:14.041
No, I wanted a thousand words
on APRs from an angle.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.273
Is that not an angle?

25:15.313 --> 25:17.543
Not unless you call "head-on" an angle.

25:17.582 --> 25:18.879
- No, I don't.
- Try it again.

25:18.917 --> 25:21.351
- Remind me why I hired you.
- OK.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.300
- Rebecca?
- [yelps]

25:37.969 --> 25:42.463
Did you just type "good angles
on APRs" into Google?

25:44.409 --> 25:47.378
Yes. I Googled.

25:51.249 --> 25:55.709
- Am I fired?
- Get your coat.

25:55.754 --> 25:57.221
You know these guys, right?

25:57.255 --> 25:59.450
Comintex? Communications company?

25:59.491 --> 26:01.049
Yes. Absolutely.

26:01.092 --> 26:03.253
This year has been a year
of unparalleled growth

26:03.295 --> 26:04.819
in the communications industry.

26:04.863 --> 26:07.161
Overall, pal. Not in your company.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.961
For us, at Comintex,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.901
profits reflect that this has been
a year of acquisitions,

26:11.937 --> 26:16.533
both of APL and of the Dutch
fiber-optic company, Zandak.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.339
Neatly masking the 24 million in bonuses

26:19.377 --> 26:22.540
- these guys paid themselves.
- Hmph. I know.

26:24.683 --> 26:27.982
Now, what we have here, Rebecca,
is a situation in which someone

26:28.019 --> 26:30.579
needs to be asking
some very hard questions.

26:30.622 --> 26:32.988
- Absolutely.
- Put your hand up.

26:33.024 --> 26:36.790
- What? No!
- Put your hand up.

26:36.828 --> 26:38.489
I don't have hard-hitting questions.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.760
- I'll give you questions.
- I'm gonna take notes.

26:40.799 --> 26:43.165
- No, Put your hand up.
- I'm more of a student.

26:43.201 --> 26:45.101
You'll be fine. Put your hand up.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.331
Hello. Hi. Hello.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.932
- He's not listening. He can't hear me.
- Louder. Stand up.

26:49.975 --> 26:52.500
- Rebecca Bloomwood!
...should see a...

- Hi, from <i>Successful Saving.</i>

27:03.455 --> 27:04.581
It's a magazine.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.820
We'll be taking questions
after the report.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.690
Good. Uh...

27:09.728 --> 27:12.128
- Ask him how much he earns.
- How much do you burn?

27:12.163 --> 27:13.596
- Earn.
- Earn.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.122
- Excuse me?
- Louder.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.259
What do you earn?

27:17.302 --> 27:20.897
- We'll take questions after.
- Why award themselves bonuses...

27:20.939 --> 27:22.668
Why did you award
yourself bonuses...

27:22.707 --> 27:24.504
...twenty-four million...
...of 23...

27:24.542 --> 27:27.272
- Twenty-four. Million.
...billion...

27:27.312 --> 27:29.974
- Million dollars...
...while investors lost eight percent?

27:30.015 --> 27:33.678
...while your investors
lost eight percent?

27:33.718 --> 27:35.913
[gasps, indistinct chattering]

27:37.789 --> 27:40.656
As I said, I'll be happy
to answer questions...

27:40.692 --> 27:42.557
Is that true?

27:46.898 --> 27:50.026
A long pause and no answer.

27:50.068 --> 27:53.629
- Long pause, no answer.
- No, no...

27:55.373 --> 27:56.965
OK. You know why we did that?

27:57.008 --> 27:58.976
Some kind of cruel initiation rite?

27:59.010 --> 28:00.705
Listen to this.

28:00.745 --> 28:04.374
"Security can mean different
things to different people.

28:04.416 --> 28:07.613
For some, it's going to a party
wearing the right shoes.

28:07.652 --> 28:10.212
This might leave you feeling
secure for an evening,

28:10.255 --> 28:13.190
but have a crippling effect
on you in later life."

28:13.224 --> 28:15.317
- I wrote that.
- You wrote that.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.692
Now, what firms like Comintex

28:17.729 --> 28:21.096
thrive on is an endemic lack
of public understanding.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.929
They get away with murder because...

28:22.967 --> 28:27.404
Maisie with a root beer and a $200
investment portfolio,

28:27.439 --> 28:28.463
what does she know?

28:28.506 --> 28:31.498
What does she actually know
about what those guys are doing?

28:31.543 --> 28:33.670
What she's told.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.010
And if the magazines
she looks to for answers

28:36.047 --> 28:37.810
aren't asking the right questions,

28:37.849 --> 28:39.840
it isn't good for Maisie.

28:40.919 --> 28:45.583
I want you to tell the truth in a way
that Maisie can understand.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.853
Now, go home,
write me an initial outline

28:49.894 --> 28:52.727
and e-mail it to me by 3:00. OK?

29:13.518 --> 29:15.145
Oh, no.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.248
Oh, yeah. Nice!

29:18.289 --> 29:21.747

from Jeff Kanter at Comintex.

29:21.793 --> 29:23.317
They're having
their stockholders' meeting.

29:23.361 --> 29:25.829
- Yes, I sent someone.
- Yeah, you did.

29:25.864 --> 29:27.627
A real find, actually, the girl I sent.

29:27.665 --> 29:30.156
She's sparky, honest.

29:30.201 --> 29:32.965
Exactly the type
that I was hoping to find.

29:33.004 --> 29:37.441
I assume that's why Edgar West
got you to recruit me.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.136
- Damn it!
- Ooh. Slice.

29:39.177 --> 29:42.374
I hired you to fix the bottom line
of this magazine,

29:42.413 --> 29:45.871
and we know the key to that
is advertising revenue.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.152
Now, you hired me
to create a product that sells,

29:50.188 --> 29:54.090
- not to sell a product.
- What if I'm with Edgar West.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.526
We're playing golf, and he just turns
to me, sort of nonchalantly, and says,

Luke Brandon decided to hire

30:00.331 --> 30:03.630

commercial interests of Dantay-West."

38:35.179 --> 38:37.272
- It's gonna be huge.
- Paycheck.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.215
- Uh, Rebecca?
- Thank you.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.309
- Yes?
- I want you to come with me

38:41.352 --> 38:42.944
to the APA Conference next week.

38:42.987 --> 38:46.548
Absolutely. What's the APA Conference?

38:46.590 --> 38:48.353
The biggest magazine
event of the year.

38:48.392 --> 38:49.791
In Miami.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.990
Oh, Luke. I think I should
definitely be there.

38:53.030 --> 38:55.225
Early, I mean,
and you know, make sure that

38:55.266 --> 38:57.894
the hotel's OK and find
good restaurants in case

38:57.935 --> 39:00.028
anyone wants to relax.
Not that I intend to,

39:00.071 --> 39:01.868
but you never know, some people might.

39:01.906 --> 39:04.306
[laughs] I'm glad
you're enthusiastic about it.

39:04.342 --> 39:08.278
- I'm kind of excited myself.
- Oh. You are?

39:12.283 --> 39:14.683
Yeah, I mean because a lot of people

39:14.719 --> 39:17.051
are very excited to meet you.

39:17.088 --> 39:20.990
You've opened up
a whole new demographic.

39:21.025 --> 39:26.088
- You're opening up his what?
- [laughing] Demographic.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.688
- Mm-hmm.
- Which is why he wants to

39:27.732 --> 39:29.757
take me to the beach.
I mean the conference.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.825
Aren't you supposed
to be getting to <i>Alette?</i>

39:31.869 --> 39:33.769
I'm on my way.
Once you're in, you're in.

39:33.804 --> 39:38.207
- You're in as a finance guru.
- I give great financial advice.

39:38.242 --> 39:40.870
Bex, have you ever considered
taking your own advice?

39:40.911 --> 39:42.503
- Oh!
- Mom, calm.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.446
Like, what would
The Girl in the Green Scarf

39:44.482 --> 39:46.780
say about hiding Visa bills
under your bed?

39:46.817 --> 39:50.184
- That is not relevant.
- That is so relevant.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.212
It's the most relevant thing
in the world.

39:52.256 --> 39:53.780
- Ah!
- There isn't another reason

39:53.824 --> 39:55.257
why you want to go to Miami?

39:55.292 --> 39:57.260
- No!
- Maybe it rhymes with Fluke?

39:57.294 --> 39:59.888
- Luke.
- [laughs]

39:59.930 --> 40:01.454
- Wha...
- That's it.

40:01.499 --> 40:03.364
- You're making that face.
- What face?

40:03.401 --> 40:05.926
Bex! You like him! This is terrible!

40:05.970 --> 40:09.337
No, no. No, no. But hypothetically...

40:09.373 --> 40:11.603
Hypothetically
you're being a big, fat liar!

40:11.642 --> 40:15.134
You're advising people about debt,
and you're up to your eyeballs in it.

40:17.281 --> 40:20.648
- [groaning]
- Yeah, hide under there.

40:25.689 --> 40:30.854

40:32.596 --> 40:36.327
My name is Brandon.
My mother's name is Sherman.

40:36.367 --> 40:40.235
Yes. <i>Monsieur discret.</i> Mm-hmm.

40:41.906 --> 40:44.238
- Oh! [laughs]
- [chuckles]

40:44.275 --> 40:46.709
- You saved me.
- Not at all.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.609
Oh, gosh!

40:48.646 --> 40:50.671
You work at <i>Successful Saving.</i>

40:50.714 --> 40:52.579
- Yes.
- We should have dinner.

[Luke] Just be yourself.

41:04.228 --> 41:06.719
- Luke, how are you?
- Hey, Luke.

41:06.764 --> 41:08.959
They let you out of prison.
That's fantastic.

41:08.999 --> 41:10.398
- Alicia.
- Luke.

41:10.434 --> 41:12.197
Can I introduce Rebecca Bloomwood?

41:12.236 --> 41:14.466
You may have read

41:14.505 --> 41:15.995
[man] What's the name of your column?

41:16.040 --> 41:18.099
"Risky investment
is like a pair of platform boots."

41:18.142 --> 41:21.305
Wait, nobody has ever
quoted me back to me before.

41:21.345 --> 41:24.439
- Luke. Got a second?
- Yeah. Sure.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.177
Wait, what were you in prison for?

41:26.217 --> 41:28.845
- Oh, that was trumped-up.
- People out there trust you.

41:28.886 --> 41:32.378
- Butterfly investments.
- [indistinct chattering]

41:37.595 --> 41:38.823
- Thanks.
- [man] Pleasure.

41:38.863 --> 41:41.388
- Champagne, please.
- [man] Right away, sir.

41:41.432 --> 41:43.900
Hi. Are you from the United North Bank?

41:43.934 --> 41:46.664
- I run it.
- I was walking past your bank.

41:46.704 --> 41:50.731
You have the most boring
window displays in the world.

41:50.774 --> 41:52.503
- She means the opposite.
- I'm serious.

41:52.543 --> 41:54.841
It's as if somebody
hit the snooze button in my brain,

41:54.879 --> 41:57.006
and told me it was OK to sleep
another ten minutes.

41:57.047 --> 41:58.412
- Really.
- Yes.

41:58.449 --> 42:01.350
You need to put some pretty
pink umbrellas or something

42:01.385 --> 42:03.250
- to get people in.
- Mr. Lewis, look here.

42:03.287 --> 42:04.515
Know what else you could do?

42:04.555 --> 42:07.581
- You could have a sale.
- A sale?

42:07.625 --> 42:10.321
Yes. Fee reductions.
And free doughnuts.

42:10.361 --> 42:13.125
She writes a humorous column,
humor is part of her language.

42:13.163 --> 42:14.824
- I'll get another.
- Unusual ideas.

42:14.865 --> 42:17.197
Luke, your writer, she's out of control.

42:17.234 --> 42:19.634
Keep her on a leash.
She's damaging the magazine.

42:19.670 --> 42:22.230
She doesn't need a leash,
I'd say quite the contrary.

42:22.273 --> 42:25.709
What was the piece of tabloid
sensationalism you sent me?

42:25.743 --> 42:27.108
The Jon Goldman expose?

42:27.144 --> 42:29.135
A well-researched, supported article.

42:29.179 --> 42:31.670
His organization is corrupt,
full of financial holes.

42:31.715 --> 42:35.048
Not running the piece. His company's
worth two million to Dantay-West.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.848
- Ryan.
- Mr. Lewis.

42:36.887 --> 42:41.517
Luke, that columnist of yours
said the most outrageous things.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.686
I'd like to apologize for our company.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.922
Outrageous, yet brilliant things.

42:45.963 --> 42:47.624
She's like a breath of fresh air.

42:47.665 --> 42:49.826
- I couldn't agree more.
- Totally agree too.

42:49.867 --> 42:52.358
- He couldn't agree more.
- Our displays are boring.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.995
- Aren't they?
- She's right.

42:54.038 --> 42:56.006
She's honest.
The doughnut idea I loved.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.065
I'll be talking to you
about advertising.

42:58.108 --> 43:00.099
- Great.
- Great.

43:00.144 --> 43:02.237
- OK.
- OK.

43:02.279 --> 43:03.837
No, you're doing great.

43:03.881 --> 43:06.475
There's one more person
that you really ought to meet.

43:06.517 --> 43:08.007
- Hmm.
- This one's pretty crucial,

43:08.052 --> 43:10.282
but having the language
in common should help.

43:10.321 --> 43:11.515
Hmm. Language?

43:11.555 --> 43:14.023
Yeah, I want you to meet
Janne Virtanen from Nokia.

43:14.058 --> 43:15.525
I told him you're part Finnish,

43:15.559 --> 43:17.527
and he's very excited to meet you.
Janne.

43:18.796 --> 43:21.458
[stuttering] Rebecca.

43:21.498 --> 43:24.797
- Ah. [speaks Finnish]
- Hey, hey, hey.

43:26.370 --> 43:27.860
That's how you do it in Finland.

43:29.506 --> 43:33.340

43:36.447 --> 43:38.415

43:38.449 --> 43:40.883
- [man] Luke! Luke Brandon!
- He's really funny.

43:40.918 --> 43:43.887
- I can't even translate that.
- Long time no see, buddy.

43:46.056 --> 43:49.890

45:41.505 --> 45:44.030
have been invited as representatives?

45:44.074 --> 45:46.065
It's a huge mark of respect.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.436
This puts us in the major league,

No, you don't.

You have to strike with precision

- Hello.

We're looking for clothes for my boss.

46:22.746 --> 46:25.237
Absolutely. Were you thinking
maybe a suit or a jacket?

46:25.282 --> 46:27.307
I'm actually thinking about everything.

46:27.351 --> 46:28.875
Oh, well, we can do everything.

46:28.919 --> 46:31.479
Pink. Oh, my gosh,
I love pink on a guy. Is that bad?

46:31.522 --> 46:33.319
- That pink is great.
- It's gorgeous.

46:33.357 --> 46:34.847
- Would he do pink?
- I think so.

46:34.892 --> 46:37.122
Think he'd do it with like a white pant?

46:37.161 --> 46:39.254
- He'd do that.
- [clears throat] Actually!

46:39.296 --> 46:42.026
What I really need is a, uh, tuxedo,

46:42.065 --> 46:44.625
say three buttons, size 48 regular,

46:44.668 --> 46:47.296
a white dress shirt,
I'll try the blue as well,

46:47.337 --> 46:51.103

But if you know how to dress well,

47:01.285 --> 47:03.685
why do you come to
the office looking like?

47:07.624 --> 47:11.890
I don't want to be defined
by clothes or labels or family.

47:13.263 --> 47:15.458
Why would you be defined by family?

47:17.801 --> 47:21.965
My mother is Elinor Sherman,
New York socialite.

47:22.005 --> 47:25.532
Excuse me, did you just say that
your mother is Elinor Sherman?

47:25.576 --> 47:28.067
Did she tell you that we dressed her
for the Met gala?

47:28.111 --> 47:30.079
Oh, she just looked stunning.

47:30.113 --> 47:33.981
Well, congratulations on having
such a fabulous mother.

47:35.786 --> 47:38.016
My, uh, parents are divorced.

47:38.055 --> 47:40.250
I grew up in England with my dad.

47:40.290 --> 47:41.552
He's great.

47:41.592 --> 47:45.688
Very down-to-earth,
totally different from my mother.

47:45.729 --> 47:51.099
Anyway, she wasn't interested
until I was an adult.

47:51.134 --> 47:54.262
At which point it was assumed
that I'd just fall into line.

47:54.304 --> 47:57.740
- For the throne?
- [laughs]

47:57.774 --> 48:02.939
Uh, no, for the, um...
for the family business.

48:05.449 --> 48:07.007
What's the business?

48:07.050 --> 48:10.918
Owning stuff. Real estate, um,

48:10.954 --> 48:13.718
Internet businesses, um...

48:16.159 --> 48:18.992
- Cable companies...
- Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry.

48:24.501 --> 48:26.969
I chose to succeed on my own terms,

48:27.004 --> 48:30.531

- Yes.

48:42.119 --> 48:46.180
Well, what would your take
be on... me?

48:47.658 --> 48:49.319
Go on.

48:49.359 --> 48:54.353
What would The Girl in the Green
Scarf's take be on Luke Brandon?

48:57.701 --> 49:00.135
As an investment, you pretty much suck.

49:00.170 --> 49:04.436
- What?
- You're a workaholic.

49:04.474 --> 49:07.910
You put in all these hours,
but you don't reap the rewards.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.607
It goes into someone else's pocket.

49:15.185 --> 49:17.380
But you're a great editor.

49:20.290 --> 49:21.780
And now...

49:23.660 --> 49:26.254
...you look like one.

49:26.296 --> 49:29.925
Drank a lot of mojitos.
I drank too many mojitos.

49:31.301 --> 49:33.963
It wasn't always work and no play.

- <i>Gracias.</i>

49:36.573 --> 49:38.404
- Cheers!
- Mmm.

Oh, <i>por favor.</i>
Pick one.

49:42.846 --> 49:45.713

But look at the red one.

49:48.618 --> 49:50.210
- The red one's cute.
- Pick one.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.540
Oh, paid my way
through college waiting tables.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.671
Coincidentally,
that fish weighs the same

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:33.705
- as the girl on your last cover.
- Ooh!

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.446
Oh, Alicia, remind me.
Were you a salmon or a trout?

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.612
You were a trout.

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:53.192
Oh... Thanks for saving me in there.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.065
So have you filled
your photo frames yet?

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:03.840
No. Not yet.

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:07.948
You could put a picture
of Alicia in one.

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:12.253
Except there probably
wouldn't be room

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:14.313
for her spidery long legs.

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.383
You know, I've always felt that

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:21.726
spidery long legs were vastly overrated.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.362
I thought she was your girlfriend.

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.905
No. She's not my girlfriend.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.443
She's not you.

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.293
Erica, you get her on the phone,

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.699
you pretend she's your
best friend in the world.

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:02.329
You find out how she got
in this terrible situation.

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:04.134
How did she get so far behind?

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.971
Then you take that information
and you use it against her.

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.738
What are her motivators? Pride?

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.575
Integrity? Honor? Fear?

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:13.411
Tell her she'll lose everything.
Slap a lien on her house.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:15.246
Tell her we'll print it in the papers.

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:17.149
Gotta take her
to the edge of the cliff.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:20.212
Let her think you're gonna push
her over and at the last minute,

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:22.554
pull her back and get
what you want out of her.

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:25.652
That, Erica, is how you earn
a commission.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.440
Lesson over.
I need <i>Successful Saving.</i>

- Speak to you then.
- Luke! Luke.

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:24.744
- Good morning.
- Hi.

- Hi.
- <i>Excusez-moi.</i>

- No. Mm-mm.
- No, no.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.053
I've come for the Green Scarf Girl.

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.990
- Me?
- Our esteemed <i>Monsieur</i> West

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.256
has asked me to dress you
for your TV debut.

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.422
I have one hour to shop.

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.159
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, excuse me,

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:46.134
but, Rebecca, Derek Smeath is here.

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:52.267
God. Um... I, uh...

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:54.572
Rebecca is being stalked.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:57.170
[gasps] So exciting
at <i>Successful Saving.</i>

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:59.181
I've had enough of this clown.
I'll see him.

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:02.048
Whoa! Luke! No!
I never want you to meet him, ever.

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:04.211
Don't worry.
I've already called security.

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:07.120
See? She called security.

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:08.987
Voilà. Shall we go? Mmm?

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.287
No. No, no, no, no.

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.726
This is outrageous!
I have every right to be here.

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.593
So after the ball, I, myself, actually

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.928
read <i>Successful Saving.</i>
Your piece was very good.

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:18.160
I have been observing you

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.430
and it seems you have
natural street fashion,

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:24.132
but... do you have genuine style?

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:32.039
Dressing is like any
worthwhile endeavor.

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:35.539
It is an art, but also a challenge.

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:37.879
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.286
This dress is good for you, huh?

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:46.022
With maybe... this jacket over.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.622
Oh, that's genius, Alette. <i>Parfait.</i>

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:53.902
I think that is a great dress,
um, but I was thinking...

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:55.403
...a little more...

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:58.464
...of something... like this?

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:06.914
I mean, I'd pair it with
a new Yves Saint Laurent coat.

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:09.784
Show me.

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:11.753
So, Rebecca, hmm.

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:15.681
Take her bag.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.725
You are sure of your choice?

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:23.892
- Yeah.
- Hmm. We'll see.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.734

Ah, yes. Is perfect.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.002
So, unfortunately, I cannot stay.

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:06.131
But I am looking forward
to seeing how you accessorize it

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:08.939
- for your TV debut. Hmm?
- Oh, thank you.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.002
Goodbye.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.348
- Oh, God.
- Is there a problem?

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:24.457
Pretty much my entire
first month's salary.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.393
Mmm. But isn't it worth it?

01:09:29.631 --> 01:09:33.068
OK, no peeking. Don't peek.
Can you see? OK. Get up here.

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:39.006
Now turn this way. OK, don't peek.
Don't peek. OK, open!

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.778
Oh, and look, look, look!
The best part!

01:09:46.948 --> 01:09:49.679
- Do you love it?
- It's so her!

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.810
Oh, Bex. This is so exciting.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.912
I'm getting married
and you love your dress,

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:56.049
and you're getting to <i>Alette,</i> and...

01:09:56.091 --> 01:09:57.752
What's in that bag?

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:01.225
Oh, that's just a dress
that Alette chose for me

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:02.890
for the TV show.

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:05.127
Mom, can you go get a cupcake?

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:09.094
How much did it cost?

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:12.705
Alette gets an incredible discount.

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.504
Still going to Shopaholics Anonymous?

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:15.703
Yes!

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:17.871
- 'Cause you promised.
- I know!

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:31.020
Oh, excuse me. Are you going
to the shopaholics meeting?

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.687
Yes.

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:35.697
Could you do me a favor
and stow these in your trunk?

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:38.291
Doesn't look good entering
a self-help shopping group

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:39.562
carrying a Barneys bag.

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:41.832
Oh! I know exactly what you mean.

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:44.236
- Leave it to me.
- OK.

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:47.140
- Hey, save me a seat, huh?
- OK.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:51.337
- [Rebecca] Thank you!
- [church bells tolling]

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:57.615
My name is Ms. Korch.
I am your new group leader.

01:10:57.653 --> 01:11:00.315
I do things differently.

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:05.456
Ms. Bloomwood?

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:07.860
You're willing to give away
your money for things

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:10.126
that you don't need,
so why not try giving away

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:11.996
the things you don't need
for no money.

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:14.366
But here's the thing:
I really need those things.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:16.166
I'll show you who really needs them.

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.298
Steady! Steady.
Courage, woman.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.208
- Oh, my. Colorful.
- This is my bridesmaid's dress.

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:26.078
Please! How many of us
have used that one before, hmm?

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:32.678
OK. I just want you to take
these clothes and... do good.

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:38.387
Ms. Bloomwood,
wasn't that liberating? Bravo!

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:41.123
[all cheering]

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:45.361
My will is strong. My wallet is closed.
I don't want to shop!

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:47.665
Back to the basement.
I couldn't be prouder.

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:52.173
There's been a mistake.
The dresses I gave in?

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:54.437
- Hmm. I need it back.
- I see. Mm-hmm. Christy!

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:55.943
Yes?

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:58.742
Can't sell those two dresses.
There's been a mistake.

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:01.648
- No returns.
- I really need these dresses!

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:03.481
I'd bring back something tomorrow.

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:05.714
- Something better.
- No exchanges.

01:12:05.754 --> 01:12:10.589
- OK, so, um, I'll buy 'em.
- You will? Oh, that's great.

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:12.389
Oh, really.
We need every cent here.

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:15.659
- OK. How much?
- A hundred and ten.

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:18.064
What? How is this a charity store?

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.795
This is from Barneys.

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:24.238
I know. OK,
I don't have enough for both.

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:27.640
- This one's twenty.
- Maybe come back for this one?

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:30.543
Which is more important?

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:33.659
<i>Got money issues? Who hasn't?</i>

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:36.844

"Wow. I get it."

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:05.970
Right. Which is exactly the point.

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:08.414
Because so much
financial journalism is really...

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:10.918
- Is really boring.
- I'm with ya on that!

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:14.118
Yes! Go, Bex!

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:15.919
It's not accessible.

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:18.722
But it's ordinary people that have
the most money in savings.

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:21.491
It is. It's people like my mom and dad.

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.696
Ow!

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:26.997

Tell the audience what you wrote

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:29.868
about the cashmere coat and worth.

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:32.840
- Well, that's you.
- No, no.

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:35.275
- He inspired me.
- Aw...

<i>[Rebecca] It's the difference</i>
<i>between cost and worth.</i>

Essentially, something

can I just say that this man

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:36.001
has been stalking Rebecca
for the past year.

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.528
Yes, I have.

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:40.804
To recover unrepaid credit
on a store card totaling

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:43.869
$9,412 and a quarter.

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:46.346
- [audience gasps]
- Is this for real?

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:49.839
No, I'm sorry,
because he is her ex-boyfriend.

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:53.745
Really?

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.915
No wonder she didn't bring him home.

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:03.026
That's good. I tell ya,

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.431
the more you look at me,
the funnier that gets.

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:12.032
OK, well, uh, my ex-girlfriend

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:13.939
told me she couldn't meet me today

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:16.604
because I might risk
contamination with an infection

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:20.547
- she picked up in Finland.
- Oh!

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:22.049
[Derek] Know she was part Finnish?

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:25.247
- [audience laughs]
- OK, we're on limited time.

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:26.652
Anybody else like to ask...

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:29.316
No, no, no.
The best is yet to come.

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:30.791
Oh, God!

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.726
<i>Did you realize</i>
<i>our Ms. Bloomwood here</i>

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:34.991
is in the hospital with depression?

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:37.521
Currently in the hospital
with gallstones.

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:39.659
"Check is in the mail" 14 times.

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:43.034
Check is lost in the mail 14 times.

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:46.165
Recovering from
a chemical fruit acid peel.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:49.336
Called back for second tour
of duty in Basra.

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.403
[laughter]

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:57.083
Which of these excuses is true?

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.212
Are any of them?

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:02.781
Will the real Rebecca Bloomwood
please stand up?

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:11.832
Well, at least I don't have to worry
about you being stalked!

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:13.300
Luke, you don't understand!

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:14.859
No, you're right, I don't!

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:17.064
So do what I hired you to do, Rebecca,

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:18.299
and make the truth clear

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.900
to somebody who absolutely
doesn't understand.

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:22.911
I shop.

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.537
Oh, so you lie because you shop.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.845
- [stammering]
- OK, OK. Why do you shop?

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:29.817
- Well, I...
- Come on, come on!

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:31.546
Well, you're not giving me time...

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.145
For what?
To make something up?

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:35.713
Just, for once in your life,
tell me the truth.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:43.195
Because when I shop,
the world gets better.

01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:45.096
The world is better.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:51.638
And then it's not anymore.
And I need to do it again.

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:58.737
Well, what about honesty?

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:03.008
What about credibility?

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:05.647
Well, I wanted to tell you,

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:09.088
but I only took the job
to get to <i>Alette.</i>

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.662
Well, I wish you all the best with that.

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:25.195
Luke, I'm so sorry.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.506
No, no. I understand.
The whole thing was a lie.

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:35.709
That absolutely makes sense.

01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:54.626
<i>[woman] # You're breaking my heart</i>
<i>You're tearing it apart</i>

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.535

<i># Now I've gone insane</i>

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:05.580
<i># And you're breaking</i>
<i>my glasses, too, OK?</i>

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:08.481
Is she wearing my bridesmaid's dress?

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.509
- [door slams]
- Suze!

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:15.021
That, I can absolutely explain!

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:18.857
OK! Explain.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:20.952
Oh...

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:25.463
Explain!

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:36.471
Suze!

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:41.445
Mr. West. I like Luke Brandon.

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:45.783
But it would seem on
recent evidence, Mr. Brandon

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:48.984
allowed his objectivity to lapse.

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.087
Mr. Brandon?

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:57.392
[sighs]

01:18:57.432 --> 01:19:00.094
Rebecca Bloomwood...

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:11.136
Rebecca Bloomwood
was the most vivacious,

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:15.912
funny, inspiring woman I have ever met.

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:21.914
And she lived a lie.
We know that now.

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:27.961
But what she wrote in her columns
was the truth.

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:30.294
She had a voice.

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:33.834
She spoke to people
who never believed

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:36.269
that they could understand,
and who loved it when

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:38.864
they found that they could.
And I loved it.

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:49.647
Rebecca Bloomwood let me down.

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:55.252
But the Girl in the Green Scarf
never did.

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:04.064
[horn plays up-tempo tune]

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:10.263
As for you, if Luke Brandon
and his attitude

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:12.705
aren't fitting in at Dantay-West,

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:15.266
there's really only ever one solution.

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:22.816
Maybe we should
start a new magazine.

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:28.687
A magazine driven purely
by the voices of its writers.

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:33.820
A part of the company,
but outside the gates, you know?

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:36.456
Yeah, sounds...
Sounds great.

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:39.990
Yeah. It's unexpected, but, you know.

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:43.801
You have drive,
Mr. Brandon, and vision.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.898
I've been impressed.

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:48.409
Oh, it'll be tough going to start,

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:52.209
but that's the way Cy and I
built this company.

01:20:52.247 --> 01:20:57.913
On the day that we put that sign up
over the door, Dantay-West.

01:20:57.953 --> 01:21:01.252
That was when we knew
that we'd made the right decision.

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:05.022
So here's to our new venture.

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:11.525
Well, I, um. I can't...

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:14.933
I cannot believe it.
I'm going to kill her.

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:20.571
Mr. West, when you put
that sign above the door,

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:23.942
you wanted to make your name
in the world, didn't you?

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:28.416
- Oh, more than anything else.
- So do I.

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:35.055
[Jane] Sweetie, she's gonna be fine.

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.388
And when you talk to her, don't...

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:41.953
Sweetie, honestly,
do you think it's too...

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:44.158
<i>"Raising Financially Fit Kids."</i>

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:45.860
Do you think it's too late for this?

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.529
Never too late. Aren't you glad
we went to that book fair?

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:54.835
Pretty amazing, ain't it?

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:57.276
That's why your mother and I
love coming out here.

01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:01.637
Reminds us of our childhood
in Finland.

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:06.249
Your mom and I think,

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:10.384
if the American economy
can be billions in debt

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:12.484
and still survive, so can you.

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:19.599
- The RV's worth about 13...
- No. Dad.

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:20.692
We want to.

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:22.794
I will kill you if you sell it.

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:26.967
It completely defines you. Completely.

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:34.145
Nothing defines me,
except you and your mother.

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:45.850
<i>[#</i> Greg Laswell:
<i>Girls Just Wanna Have Fun]</i>

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.610
So she really did it?
And it all worked.

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.181
What do you mean?

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:48.246
You mean you don't know.

01:23:48.289 --> 01:23:50.883
Oh, this is good.

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:55.760
Alette Naylor is going to see
the little green scarf girl

01:23:55.797 --> 01:24:00.029
to give her the one thing that
she wants most in all the world.

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:04.061
And now I'm stuck with her.

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.720
[Alette] I'm very happy
to have found you.

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:10.677
- I went to Mr. West to...
- Hot.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:14.148
Ah. Thank you. Charles <i>et</i> Diana.

01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:16.912
No, no. They're not from Indiana,
they're from England.

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:19.010
No, Dad, she said Charles and Diana.

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:22.581
Yes. Well, I went to see Mr. West
to petition for clemency...

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:26.287
...which he gave.
- And is Luke Brandon OK?

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:31.390
Unfortunately, <i>Monsieur</i> Brandon
is no longer with Dantay-West.

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:34.266
But he'll land on his feet.

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:38.864
He's a Sherman, after all. Rebecca...

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:43.000
You may not know this,
but your appearance

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:46.912
on that TV show has struck
a nerve with many, many girls.

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:49.378
They identify with you.

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:55.322
Your column will be <i>Affordable Fashion.</i>

01:24:56.591 --> 01:25:00.891
Five hundred words once a month.
Welcome to <i>Alette.</i>

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.295
[gasps, laughing]
I can do affordable fashion.

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:05.128
I mean, I know where all the sales are.

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:06.428
Yes, yes, she does. Oh!

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:08.663
In fact, she got that from me.

01:25:08.703 --> 01:25:12.230
No, I didn't. I didn't.
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't.

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:15.709
- Oh, cake?
- Yes.

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.576
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:21.741
Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.

- No, tiny. Tiny! Tiny!

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:26.887
Hmm.

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:37.689
Thank you.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:42.262
You will make your column personal.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:43.463
Mm-hmm.

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:45.632
You'll take pieces
from your own wardrobe,

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:47.834
like this for example.
This is very pretty.

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:49.810
- They're swell.
- This season, I believe.

01:25:49.844 --> 01:25:52.813
Um, well, they're Louboutins,

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:55.782
so, I mean, well,
they're not affordable fashion.

01:25:55.817 --> 01:26:01.278
Fear not. <i>Chez Alette,</i>
we print the prices very small.

01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:06.254
And after all,
what are credit cards for, huh?

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:07.955
You must know that.

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:12.759
Yeah, wow.

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:19.303
Yeah, no, I, um...
I know all about credit cards.

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:22.366
And final notices and debt collectors.

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:26.107
Um, they should print that
in the fashion magazines. Right?

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:27.808
Mm-hmm.

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:30.909
Rebecca, you have a moral conscience.

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:33.352
But if you want to work
for my magazine...

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:36.084
No, no, I really...
I wanna work at <i>Alette.</i>

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:39.151
What's the matter, baby?

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:43.494
I just, I have that really annoying
feeling in the pit of my stomach.

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:45.260
You know that feeling when?

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.359
Yes. I get it...
I get it in the back of my head.

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.393
[Rebecca] Yeah, when...
You know what I mean?

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:52.565
You wanna do something, but
you sort of feel like you shouldn't?

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:54.802
- That's it!
- I get heartburn.

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:04.617
I just... I have made
so many mistakes,

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:10.454
and I feel like taking this job
would be another one.

01:27:10.491 --> 01:27:13.051
Before you make your decision,
you should know this.

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:17.588
When I leave this house,
the opportunity leave with me.

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:22.165
Well, then you should both go.

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:28.566

Can't you finance this yourself?

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:39.218
I'm asking if you will back me.

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:45.356
I'm asking if I am a good investment.

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:52.192
All right, people, this is it.
I want you to think of it

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:55.259
as a toxic little monkey on your back.

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:58.636
Do it, Freak!
But anybody who cries

01:27:58.673 --> 01:28:02.040
- will have to cut two cards.

I'm Rebecca Bloomwood
and I'm a shopaholic.

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.841
[all] Hi, Rebecca.

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:10.476
I destroyed my career
on national television.

01:28:10.518 --> 01:28:14.852
I lied to the man I love.
I hurt my best friend.

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:18.689
I invented a stalker,
and I don't even speak Finnish.

01:28:18.726 --> 01:28:22.526
But I have a plan, and I need your help.

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:24.121

01:28:57.498 --> 01:29:01.195
Oh, uh, Luke, sorry.
Um, may I take a long lunch?

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:03.396
Sure. What are you doing?

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:06.236
Oh! Oh, uh, I have an appointment.

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:09.869

- A person.

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:14.539
Um...

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:25.659
Uh, I suppose she has to,
uh, clear the decks.

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:29.151
You know, make room
for all those free clothes from <i>Alette.</i>

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.324
Go, Hayley.

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:36.132
- May I?
- [clears throat]

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:45.171
- Bags!
- Ready!

- Millinery.
- What you call me?

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:53.548
- Hats.
- Oh!

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:55.283
I hope they've got shoes!

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.987
They're gettin' antsy out there.

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:05.626
Ready when you are, Ms. Bloomwood.

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:06.997

There's plenty for everyone.

Just, take your...

You'll note the delicious color,

the smart collar
and these classic buttons.

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:25.413
Thirty dollars is my final offer.

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:27.614
I'll give you $30

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:29.816
What about your mother?
What would she like?

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:30.949
Sobriety.

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:33.552
- I think it's...
- It's a lucky top.

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:36.062
These are real Prada shoes, ladies.

They go with the same pink

01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:41.434
And the handbag.
Oh. And the gloves.

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:44.165
OK, you know what, not for sale.
Not for sale.

Supple, sensual,

Rebecca always had such fabulous taste.

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:06.886
No wonder she wound up
at <i>Alette</i> magazine.

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:09.158
Oh, Becky didn't end up
at <i>Alette</i> magazine.

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:11.165

- Yes, Jane Bloomwood, hi.

- Don't sell it.

You've sold so much already.

You can tell your friend on the phone,
I'll match anything they bid.

- Going twice.
- My bidder withdraws.

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:13.690

What are you doing?

I'm doing exactly what you did to me
on that television show, Derek.

I'm just giving you what you deserve.

inconvenient way possible.
