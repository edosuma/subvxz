WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:04.268
DAVID WILCOCK: There is
a metaphysical connection

00:04.305 --> 00:06.835
to the most significant
technological breakthroughs.

00:06.874 --> 00:10.844
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: Ramanujan
describes how he was asleep

00:10.878 --> 00:14.108
and he saw these numbers
being written in front of him,

00:14.148 --> 00:16.678
and he had no idea
what this was all about.

00:16.717 --> 00:20.547
WILLIAM HENRY: The meeting of
John von Neumann and Alan Turing

00:20.588 --> 00:22.188
changed history.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.824
Maybe Steve Jobs
was receiving information

00:25.860 --> 00:27.690
beyond the physical realm.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.427
DAVID CHILDRESS: Is it possible
that extraterrestrials

00:31.465 --> 00:34.225
are somehow guiding
certain people

00:34.268 --> 00:38.398
to bring them to their
higher levels of knowledge?

00:38.439 --> 00:42.469
HENRY: It appears that these
beings are guiding humanity

00:42.510 --> 00:46.210
into a new age of super-advanced
technology that will ultimately

00:46.247 --> 00:48.947
allow us to interface
with the cosmos.

00:48.983 --> 00:52.453
NARRATOR:
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:52.486 --> 00:56.486
mankind has credited
its origins to gods

00:56.524 --> 00:59.294
and other visitors
from the stars.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.586
What if it were true?

01:01.629 --> 01:04.529
Did extraterrestrial beings

01:04.565 --> 01:07.695
really help
to shape our history?

01:07.735 --> 01:11.535
And if so, could there
be a connection

01:11.572 --> 01:16.242
between aliens
and our greatest visionaries?

NARRATOR:
Houston, Texas.

01:47.341 --> 01:50.941
July 20, 1969.

01:50.978 --> 01:54.478
At NASA Mission Control Center,

01:54.515 --> 01:57.815
the massive IBM System/360

01:57.852 --> 02:02.052
Model 75 computer,
which boasts processing power

02:02.089 --> 02:06.059
of 16.6 million
instructions per second

02:06.093 --> 02:08.562
and up to eight megabytes
of main memory,

02:08.596 --> 02:13.466
is employed to accomplish the
greatest feat in human history--

02:13.501 --> 02:16.341
putting a man on the moon.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.840
NEAL ARMSTRONG: Houston, uh,
Tranquility Base here.

02:23.878 --> 02:26.448
The Eagle has landed.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.810
NARRATOR:
People across the world

02:28.849 --> 02:31.679
marveled at this
technological achievement.

02:36.857 --> 02:41.027
But incredibly,
only six decades later,

02:41.061 --> 02:45.131
a handheld device weighing
less than half a pound

02:45.166 --> 02:49.996
dwarfs the total technology
NASA possessed in 1969.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.805
Today's smartphone contains

02:53.841 --> 02:57.841
a staggering one million times
the computing power

02:57.878 --> 03:00.508
used to carry out
the moon landing.

03:00.548 --> 03:04.548
What we had when they went
to the moon is like nothing

03:04.585 --> 03:07.245
compared to what an average
teenager carries around now.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.588
I mean, the kind
of computing power,

03:08.622 --> 03:09.992
the ability
to access information,

03:10.024 --> 03:11.364
the ability to reach people.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.592
An astonishing
technological achievement.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.328
You can only imagine
what's gonna happen

03:16.363 --> 03:18.033
in 30 years from now.

03:18.065 --> 03:21.725
What we think is so advanced
is gonna be so not advanced.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.938
NARRATOR: How is it that
mankind's technology

03:26.974 --> 03:29.274
has advanced so rapidly?

03:29.310 --> 03:33.380
According to ancient
astronaut theorists,

03:33.414 --> 03:35.414
at specific points in history,

03:35.449 --> 03:39.889
extraterrestrials have
influenced certain individuals

03:39.920 --> 03:43.290
to allow humanity
to make major leaps forward,

03:43.324 --> 03:46.764
and they propose
that this has continued

03:46.794 --> 03:48.994
up until modern times.

03:49.029 --> 03:52.929
As evidence, they point
to the visionary

03:52.967 --> 03:56.867
who jump-started
the microcomputer revolution,

03:56.904 --> 03:58.944
Steve Jobs.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.780
San Francisco, California.

04:04.812 --> 04:08.382
January 9, 2007.

04:08.415 --> 04:12.815
Apple's annual Macworld
Conference and Expo.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.223
Thank you for coming.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.685
NARRATOR: At the center
of a worldwide media frenzy,

04:17.725 --> 04:21.625
Apple cofounder and CEO,
Steve Jobs,

04:21.661 --> 04:26.572
takes the stage to announce
a revolutionary new product,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.230
the iPhone.

04:28.269 --> 04:32.499
What we want to do is make
a leapfrog product that is

04:32.539 --> 04:35.409
way smarter than any mobile
device has ever been

04:35.442 --> 04:36.812
and super easy to use.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.744
(audience cheers, applauds)

04:41.415 --> 04:44.915
And we are calling it "iPhone."

04:44.952 --> 04:47.692
(audience cheers)

04:47.721 --> 04:50.721
KARA SWISHER: Steve Jobs was
one of the greatest visionaries

04:50.758 --> 04:52.618
in Silicon Valley.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.830
The idea of what he was doing
is how you popularize computing.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.028
A lot of people who were
early in computing

05:00.067 --> 05:02.767
didn't think about
people using them,

05:02.803 --> 05:04.803
and he managed to deliver
into the hands of consumers

05:04.838 --> 05:07.538
a device that was usable,
it was intuitive,

05:07.574 --> 05:10.944
it was easy to use,
it was easy to understand,

05:10.978 --> 05:12.908
and-and that is not
a small thing.

05:12.946 --> 05:16.146
In the simplicity
and the beauty of it,

05:16.183 --> 05:20.123
he made something
that was, um, just perfect.

05:23.857 --> 05:27.657
NARRATOR: Steve Jobs and
his team of engineers at Apple

05:27.695 --> 05:31.595
harnessed technology that
connected society digitally

05:31.632 --> 05:33.902
and put all
the world's knowledge

05:33.934 --> 05:36.874
literally at
mankind's fingertips.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.941
But the seeds of this
technological revolution

05:43.977 --> 05:47.207
were planted in 1973,

05:47.247 --> 05:51.817
when the 19-year-old college
student dropped out of school.

05:51.852 --> 05:56.222
Jobs was attending Reed College
in Portland, Oregon,

05:56.256 --> 06:00.086
when he, along with one
of Apple's first employees,

06:00.127 --> 06:03.527
Daniel Kottke, made a decision
that would change

06:03.564 --> 06:05.964
not only the course
of their lives,

06:05.999 --> 06:09.739
but ultimately
the course of humanity.

06:09.770 --> 06:14.640
DANIEL KOTTKE: I met Steve
at Reed College the first month,

06:14.675 --> 06:19.305
but our friendship developed
because a week or two later,

06:19.346 --> 06:21.646
I must have been
walking around with a copy

06:21.682 --> 06:25.222
of <i> Be Here Now,</i> and I was
eager to talk about it,

06:25.252 --> 06:28.152
and Steve was familiar with it.

06:28.188 --> 06:32.588
That book quickly led to
<i>Autobiography of a Yogi,</i>

06:32.626 --> 06:36.596
and then led to
<i>Ramakrishna and His Disciples.</i>

06:40.200 --> 06:42.930
NARRATOR:
Like many of his generation,

06:42.970 --> 06:46.970
Jobs became caught up in the
spiritual enlightenment movement

06:47.007 --> 06:51.177
that was sweeping through
America in the 1970s.

06:51.211 --> 06:55.211
And according to those
who knew him best,

06:55.249 --> 06:58.749
he considered it
not just a passing interest

06:58.786 --> 07:00.316
but a calling.

07:00.354 --> 07:03.324
Steve got ahold of the book
<i>Cosmic Consciousness.</i>

07:03.357 --> 07:05.887
That's probably what
pushed him over the edge.

07:05.926 --> 07:10.796
It had chapters about
great geniuses through history

07:10.831 --> 07:15.001
and how they were enlightened,
and that was the whole thesis.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.965
That's how we ended up in India.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.542
NARRATOR: Fueled by his desire
to find spiritual enlightenment,

07:22.576 --> 07:24.576
Steve Jobs traveled to India,

07:24.611 --> 07:27.881
with Daniel following
a few months later.

07:27.915 --> 07:31.945
Together they discovered
a Hindu guru

07:31.985 --> 07:35.185
known as Haidakhan Baba.

07:35.222 --> 07:39.162
LAYNE LITTLE: He was discovered
at about the age of 18

07:39.193 --> 07:42.863
doing yoga in a cave.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.856
But there are legends going back
that the same figure

07:45.899 --> 07:49.199
had appeared all the way
back into the 1800s.

07:49.236 --> 07:52.636
NARRATOR:
Haidakhan Baba claimed

07:52.673 --> 07:55.643
that he had no mother or father.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.636
But who was this character

07:57.678 --> 08:00.678
who had no known history
before the age of 18

08:00.714 --> 08:06.624
and was said to have manifested
out of thin air?

08:06.653 --> 08:10.893
He professed that he was
an immortal being

08:10.924 --> 08:14.864
known in Hinduism
as Mahavatar Babaji.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.828
Mahavatar means, uh,
"the great avatar."

08:20.868 --> 08:24.368
"The great incarnated being."

08:26.807 --> 08:31.407
Mahavatar is eternal, and he can
appear anytime, anywhere,

08:31.445 --> 08:34.345
taking forms
of another human being.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.076
So he was here to change

08:38.118 --> 08:41.087
the humanity, uh,
in-in a better path,

08:41.121 --> 08:45.091
in-in a path of understanding,
a path of greatness.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.825
LITTLE: Steve Jobs did spend
some time with him.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.901
Haidakhan Baba actually
gave him an initiation

08:51.932 --> 08:53.832
by giving him a spiritual name.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.137
This is a traditional
kind of initiation,

08:57.170 --> 09:01.210
so they were formally
initiated by this guru.

09:01.241 --> 09:07.051
Babaji had said
that he was a celestial being

09:07.080 --> 09:11.020
who had come to Earth
to help enlighten our planet

09:11.051 --> 09:13.051
and to advance us forward.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.346
And we have to wonder,
is it possible that Steven Jobs

09:16.390 --> 09:18.790
was being influenced
telepathically

09:18.825 --> 09:23.185
by an extraterrestrial
entity named Babaji?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.868
NARRATOR:
Haidakhan Baba claimed

09:26.900 --> 09:31.000
that he had "come to guide
humanity to a higher path"

09:31.038 --> 09:35.738
and referred to himself as the
"messenger of the revolution."

09:35.776 --> 09:39.706
Shortly after returning
to the United States,

09:39.746 --> 09:43.676
Steve Jobs embarked
on a revolution himself,

09:43.717 --> 09:46.687
the development
of the microcomputer,

09:46.720 --> 09:50.720
along with Apple cofounder
Steve Wozniak.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.717
Steve was not in it for money.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.859
He was in it for the mission

09:54.895 --> 09:58.125
of transforming the world.

09:58.165 --> 10:02.695
The Apple II was the first
mass-market personal computer.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.096
Woz of course was
the all-around genius

10:05.138 --> 10:09.338
who created the whole design
and all the software.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.306
But the thing that Steve
gets huge credit for

10:12.346 --> 10:16.946
is having enough passion for
what he saw the future bringing

10:16.984 --> 10:18.484
that he just did not give up.

10:18.518 --> 10:21.918
And the iPhone of course
is the computer now

10:21.955 --> 10:24.315
that is taking over
all our lives.

10:24.358 --> 10:27.188
Transformed everything,
everything.

10:27.227 --> 10:31.297
NARRATOR: Steve Jobs continued
to practice meditation

10:31.331 --> 10:33.931
throughout the rest of his life,

10:33.967 --> 10:37.567
often finding refuge at
Tassajara Zen Mountain Center

10:37.604 --> 10:40.974
in California's
Los Padres National Forest.

10:42.743 --> 10:46.483
It was here,
while deep in meditation,

10:46.513 --> 10:49.983
that Jobs thought he received
much of the inspiration

10:50.017 --> 10:52.377
that transformed
the modern world.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.019
DEEPAK SHIMKHADA:
Meditation does help

10:54.054 --> 10:57.024
to connect with a higher source,
a higher force,

10:57.057 --> 11:00.227
because then one becomes
one with the divine,

11:00.260 --> 11:02.230
so they could, you know,
in-in a sense, uh,

11:02.262 --> 11:05.202
download the knowledge,
wisdom directly from them.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.095
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that Steve Jobs

11:11.138 --> 11:15.608
received guidance
from an otherworldly source?

11:15.642 --> 11:19.482
And if so, could it be
that he was just one

11:19.513 --> 11:21.913
of a number of key visionaries

11:21.948 --> 11:24.318
who were chosen
by extraterrestrials

11:24.351 --> 11:27.121
to lead humanity
into the future,

11:27.154 --> 11:30.764
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest?

11:30.791 --> 11:33.661
Perhaps further answers
can be found

11:33.694 --> 11:37.264
by examining
an Indian mathematician

11:37.297 --> 11:40.497
who was decades
ahead of his time.

11:44.896 --> 11:48.156
NARRATOR: Emory University,
Atlanta, Georgia.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.270
December 2012.

11:51.303 --> 11:54.143
After years of work,

11:54.172 --> 11:57.972
mathematician Ken Ono
and two of his former students

11:58.010 --> 12:01.410
come up with a groundbreaking
mathematical formula

12:01.446 --> 12:04.246
that will allow scientists
to study black holes

12:04.282 --> 12:07.852
in an entirely new way.

12:07.886 --> 12:11.856
Incredibly,
they achieved this feat

12:11.890 --> 12:15.030
by studying
a single paragraph written

12:15.060 --> 12:19.330
by an Indian mathematician
over nine decades earlier--

12:19.364 --> 12:23.034
Srinivasa Ramanujan.

12:26.104 --> 12:30.044
WILCOCK: Srinivasa Ramanujan
was an Indian mathematician

12:30.075 --> 12:34.275
who is unlike any other genius
in world history.

12:34.312 --> 12:38.212
Ramanujan's work
has now formed the basis

12:38.250 --> 12:41.520
for superstring theory
and multidimensional physics.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.053
Some of the most advanced math

12:44.089 --> 12:47.519
that all the high-end scientists
are still using today

12:47.559 --> 12:49.559
is called "modular functions,"

12:49.594 --> 12:53.134
which could lead
to time travel, antigravity,

12:53.165 --> 12:57.365
limitless free energy, all of
this futuristic technology.

12:57.402 --> 13:01.542
He was able to take
a little that he knew

13:01.573 --> 13:05.583
farther than most mathematicians
would be able to take them.

13:05.610 --> 13:09.580
He had the vision
to see what was important.

13:09.614 --> 13:12.984
There are just so many
beautiful ideas that he had,

13:13.018 --> 13:16.548
some of which are just
waiting to be developed.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.458
NARRATOR:
Ramanujan made breakthroughs

13:19.491 --> 13:22.161
in integral calculus,

13:22.194 --> 13:25.604
which can be used to determine
the drag force buffeting a wing

13:25.630 --> 13:28.160
as it slides through the air

13:28.200 --> 13:31.100
or the gravitational
effects of the Earth

13:31.136 --> 13:32.936
on a man-made satellite.

13:32.971 --> 13:36.541
But perhaps
what is most noteworthy

13:36.575 --> 13:40.535
is that Ramanujan insisted
these baffling theorems

13:40.579 --> 13:44.049
were not simply the product
of his own genius.

13:44.082 --> 13:47.552
He claimed they were
communicated to him

13:47.586 --> 13:50.986
by an otherworldly being.

13:51.022 --> 13:54.222
Srinivasa Ramanujan was born

13:54.259 --> 13:59.059
in Erode, India,
on December 22, 1887,

13:59.097 --> 14:02.197
and was considered
a miracle child

14:02.234 --> 14:05.444
because he was the only one
of his mother's four children

14:05.470 --> 14:07.040
to survive infancy.

14:07.072 --> 14:12.112
Even as a young boy,
he was obsessed with numbers.

14:12.144 --> 14:16.614
From a very early age,
just instinctively,

14:16.648 --> 14:19.548
he was thinking about numbers,
he was calculating.

14:19.584 --> 14:21.994
He was fascinated by numbers.

14:22.020 --> 14:24.320
Numbers, he said,
have personalities for him,

14:24.356 --> 14:26.956
that they had
a kind of life for him.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.492
There are a lot of stories

14:28.527 --> 14:31.627
about how he was so focused
on mathematics

14:31.663 --> 14:34.403
that he would ignore
a lot of his other subjects.

14:34.432 --> 14:39.242
NARRATOR: Ramanujan grew up
in the town of Kumbakonam,

14:39.271 --> 14:44.071
in a house within view of the
impressive Sarangapani Temple.

14:44.109 --> 14:46.379
The mathematical prodigy

14:46.411 --> 14:48.981
spent much of his childhood
at the temple

14:49.014 --> 14:52.984
among thousands of carvings
of Hindu gods.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.748
According to Ramanujan's
childhood friend,

14:55.787 --> 15:00.087
he would often go to the temple
and work on mathematics.

15:00.125 --> 15:03.155
The friend had a memory
of coming into the temple

15:03.195 --> 15:05.125
and finding Ramanujan

15:05.163 --> 15:09.433
with all these inexplicable
figures surrounding him.

15:09.467 --> 15:13.137
NARRATOR: The figures
that surrounded Ramanujan

15:13.171 --> 15:16.571
were in fact complex
mathematical equations

15:16.608 --> 15:19.508
that he had written in chalk
on the stone slabs

15:19.544 --> 15:21.484
of the temple floor.

15:21.513 --> 15:23.613
He would often say

15:23.648 --> 15:26.048
that they were communicated
to him in his dreams

15:26.084 --> 15:30.224
by the Hindu goddess
Namagiri Thayar.

15:30.255 --> 15:35.085
He always insisted, and he was
very adamant about this,

15:35.126 --> 15:37.126
that the mathematical
discoveries he made

15:37.162 --> 15:39.132
came to him in dreams
and visions

15:39.164 --> 15:42.504
provided by
the goddess Namagiri.

15:42.534 --> 15:44.434
In these visions,

15:44.469 --> 15:49.039
he would see these fantastic,
beautiful mathematical formulae

15:49.074 --> 15:51.344
un-scrolling before him.

15:54.779 --> 15:57.779
NARRATOR: Numerous times
throughout Ramanujan's youth,

15:57.816 --> 16:00.816
he would abruptly vanish
for days at a time,

16:00.852 --> 16:04.152
then return home
without explanation.

16:04.189 --> 16:08.019
His neighbors considered him
to be psychic.

16:08.059 --> 16:11.059
And he suggested
that numbers connect us

16:11.096 --> 16:13.556
to higher powers
in the universe.

16:13.598 --> 16:17.728
Could it be that
Ramanujan really was

16:17.769 --> 16:21.569
receiving information
from an otherworldly being?

16:21.606 --> 16:23.506
Ever since he was
a little child,

16:23.541 --> 16:29.181
he was having these visions
of the Hindu goddess Namagiri,

16:29.214 --> 16:32.184
and on his own,
in poverty in India,

16:32.217 --> 16:35.687
he re-derives over
a hundred years' worth

16:35.720 --> 16:37.820
of Western mathematics.

16:37.856 --> 16:40.316
But then the goddess Namagiri
is giving him

16:40.358 --> 16:42.628
all this other information

16:42.661 --> 16:47.501
that goes way beyond where
Western mathematics had gone.

16:47.532 --> 16:49.472
CHILDRESS:
For someone like Ramanujan,

16:49.501 --> 16:53.901
who grows up in a devout Hindu
family in southern India,

16:53.938 --> 16:56.768
everything that-that
he experiences has to do

16:56.808 --> 16:59.178
with Hindu gods and goddesses.

16:59.210 --> 17:02.810
But is it possible
that it was really

17:02.847 --> 17:04.747
some kind of extraterrestrial

17:04.782 --> 17:09.393
who was helping him develop
these mathematical theorems?

17:09.421 --> 17:11.721
WILCOCK:
There is abundant evidence

17:11.756 --> 17:16.226
of extraterrestrial
intervention that is involved

17:16.261 --> 17:20.131
in many of the most significant
technological breakthroughs

17:20.165 --> 17:22.825
that we see in our world,

17:22.867 --> 17:25.837
and these could come
through the form of dreams

17:25.869 --> 17:30.710
or actual contacts with some
sort of intelligent beings.

17:32.610 --> 17:34.940
NARRATOR:
Could Srinivasa Ramanujan,

17:34.979 --> 17:37.809
who practiced meditation
and studied Hinduism,

17:37.849 --> 17:40.379
much like Steve Jobs,

17:40.418 --> 17:43.388
have received guidance
from otherworldly beings

17:43.421 --> 17:46.321
that have been directing
the course of humanity

17:46.358 --> 17:48.358
for thousands of years?

17:50.362 --> 17:54.262
Is this why he was able
to devise theorems so complex

17:54.299 --> 17:57.399
that the world's
greatest mathematicians

17:57.435 --> 18:02.335
are still struggling to
understand them 100 years later?

18:02.374 --> 18:06.384
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

18:06.411 --> 18:09.281
and suggest further evidence
can be found

18:09.314 --> 18:11.814
by examining the man
who helped bring about

18:11.850 --> 18:15.220
the end of World War II,

18:15.253 --> 18:17.923
Alan Turing.

18:20.274 --> 18:21.744
NARRATOR:
London, England.

18:21.775 --> 18:24.875
June 23, 1912.

18:24.912 --> 18:28.382
In the residential district
of Maida Vale,

18:28.415 --> 18:31.375
Alan Turing is born.

18:31.418 --> 18:34.118
By the age of six,

18:34.154 --> 18:38.264
his teachers identify him
as a genius.

18:38.292 --> 18:40.762
By 16, he is studying

18:40.794 --> 18:44.564
the most advanced work
of Albert Einstein.

18:44.598 --> 18:47.498
And much like
the Indian mathematical genius

18:47.534 --> 18:52.404
Srinivasa Ramanujan,
he has a single-minded focus

18:52.439 --> 18:55.909
and thinks differently
from his peers.

18:55.943 --> 18:59.883
LEAVITT:
Alan Turing was

18:59.913 --> 19:03.953
the other great mathematical
genius of the 20th century,

19:03.984 --> 19:06.854
but of a completely
different stripe

19:06.887 --> 19:09.817
than Srinivasa Ramanujan.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.987
His vision was born

19:12.026 --> 19:14.786
out of an extraordinary
literal-mindedness.

19:14.828 --> 19:19.228
By taking things literally,
he was able to go places

19:19.266 --> 19:21.926
that people who were
less literal-minded

19:21.969 --> 19:24.039
would never be able to go.

19:25.939 --> 19:29.909
NARRATOR: In fact, Alan Turing
was so literal-minded

19:29.943 --> 19:31.983
that there has even
been speculation

19:32.012 --> 19:34.352
he had Asperger's syndrome.

19:34.381 --> 19:37.551
But some ancient astronaut
theorists propose

19:37.584 --> 19:43.564
his unique intellect may reveal
an otherworldly influence,

19:43.590 --> 19:47.830
one that intervened during
mankind's deadliest conflict.

19:53.300 --> 19:56.900
Milton Keynes,
Buckinghamshire, England.

19:56.937 --> 19:59.907
March 18, 1940.

20:03.877 --> 20:06.847
Six months into
the Second World War,

20:06.880 --> 20:10.380
British military intelligence
sets up

20:10.417 --> 20:12.877
a top-secret base
in Bletchley Park,

20:12.920 --> 20:15.750
50 miles northwest of London.

20:17.958 --> 20:20.458
Known as "Station X,"

20:20.494 --> 20:23.434
it is home to a handpicked team
of mathematicians

20:23.464 --> 20:27.704
led by Alan Turing
that work tirelessly to crack

20:27.734 --> 20:30.004
the infamous Nazi
encoding device

20:30.037 --> 20:32.097
called the Enigma machine.

20:36.677 --> 20:40.647
LEAVITT: The Enigma machine
was an encryption machine

20:40.681 --> 20:42.551
that worked very simply,

20:42.583 --> 20:45.553
at least for the person
operating it.

20:45.586 --> 20:48.586
You would have
a message to convey,

20:48.622 --> 20:50.862
and you would type
the first letter.

20:50.891 --> 20:53.431
Its gears would turn.

20:56.363 --> 20:59.803
And then a light
would illuminate

20:59.833 --> 21:01.533
with another letter.

21:01.568 --> 21:03.468
And that letter
you would write down.

21:07.608 --> 21:10.478
The machine was putting
the letter

21:10.511 --> 21:14.911
through a huge range
of substitutions.

21:18.118 --> 21:20.848
NARRATOR:
In 1940, Turing accomplished

21:20.888 --> 21:25.058
what nearly every expert at
the time had deemed impossible.

21:25.092 --> 21:28.092
He solved the Enigma code.

21:33.867 --> 21:36.197
PAUL CERUZZI: At Bletchley Park,
Turing conceived

21:36.236 --> 21:40.536
of a way of reverse engineering
an Enigma to run it backwards.

21:40.574 --> 21:42.274
It wasn't easy, but they built

21:42.309 --> 21:44.609
this very complicated machine
called the bombe.

21:44.645 --> 21:47.605
If you could separate
out the hardware

21:47.648 --> 21:49.678
from the sequences
of operations--

21:49.716 --> 21:51.646
what we now call software--

21:51.685 --> 21:55.815
you could create a machine
that could decode messages,

21:55.856 --> 21:59.786
but it could also do other
things, including mathematics,

21:59.826 --> 22:03.596
and I think that he realized
that this machine could be made

22:03.630 --> 22:06.260
into something that was quite,
uh, a bit more capable.

22:06.300 --> 22:10.670
NARRATOR: In the process
of creating this machine,

22:10.704 --> 22:14.714
Turing also developed a
technology far more significant

22:14.741 --> 22:18.141
than anyone at the time
could have imagined:

22:18.178 --> 22:21.308
the world's first computer.

22:24.351 --> 22:26.151
CHILDRESS:
It's particularly interesting

22:26.186 --> 22:29.216
how some of these visionaries
think differently,

22:29.256 --> 22:31.186
so you have to wonder
if these people

22:31.225 --> 22:35.225
are tapping into some kind
of universal mind,

22:35.262 --> 22:38.202
and even that somehow
telepathically

22:38.232 --> 22:42.002
extraterrestrials are
giving them information

22:42.035 --> 22:45.865
so that they can see
these universal truths.

22:48.675 --> 22:51.005
NARRATOR: Curiously,
in one of his papers,

22:51.044 --> 22:55.584
Turing wrote that telekinesis
and extrasensory perception

22:55.616 --> 22:57.916
should be taken seriously

22:57.951 --> 23:00.891
and questioned
the existence of free will.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.391
Is it possible,

23:03.423 --> 23:06.293
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest,

23:06.326 --> 23:11.196
that he wrote this because he
himself was somehow in contact

23:11.231 --> 23:14.901
with extraterrestrial
intelligence?

23:14.935 --> 23:18.295
Perhaps further clues
can be found

23:18.338 --> 23:20.368
by examining
a meeting Turing had

23:20.407 --> 23:24.077
before the war with another
mathematical genius,

23:24.111 --> 23:26.241
John von Neumann.

23:28.615 --> 23:31.645
John von Neumann was
a Hungarian mathematician

23:31.685 --> 23:33.615
who emigrated
to the United States

23:33.654 --> 23:37.564
and took a position
at Princeton University.

23:37.591 --> 23:39.261
He had an incredible talent

23:39.293 --> 23:42.793
for mathematics and physics
in all kinds of fields.

23:42.829 --> 23:46.629
NARRATOR: Like Turing, von
Neumann contributed to ending

23:46.667 --> 23:50.937
World War II through
the development of technology.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.941
He came up with a way
to use machine calculation

23:53.974 --> 23:58.314
to determine how to compress
plutonium for the atomic bomb.

24:00.881 --> 24:04.621
This technology was essential
to the success of the project,

24:04.651 --> 24:06.421
and it might never
have been realized

24:06.453 --> 24:10.463
had von Neumann not
crossed paths with Alan Turing.

24:12.459 --> 24:14.459
CERUZZI:
We know that Alan Turing,

24:14.494 --> 24:18.034
uh, met John von Neumann
at Princeton.

24:18.065 --> 24:21.025
Von Neumann was familiar with
Turing's theoretical papers.

24:21.068 --> 24:22.568
What we don't know

24:22.602 --> 24:24.572
is the substance
of their conversations.

24:24.604 --> 24:27.774
A lot of that was
very highly classified.

24:27.808 --> 24:31.738
Very, very little information
ever leaked out.

24:31.778 --> 24:35.708
It has been argued by
some historians of computing

24:35.749 --> 24:40.049
that John von Neumann absorbed
the fundamental idea

24:40.087 --> 24:43.487
of the universal machine
from Alan Turing.

24:45.492 --> 24:47.092
NARRATOR:
According to historians,

24:47.127 --> 24:50.557
Turing and von Neumann
were largely responsible

24:50.597 --> 24:53.767
for inventing
the first computers

24:53.800 --> 24:57.200
and accelerating the advancement
of technology exponentially.

24:59.306 --> 25:03.106
But is it possible the meeting
of these two geniuses

25:03.143 --> 25:06.143
was more than mere chance?

25:09.015 --> 25:10.945
WILCOCK:
It could very well be

25:10.984 --> 25:13.394
that extraterrestrial
intelligence was involved

25:13.420 --> 25:16.220
in making sure
that von Neumann and Turing

25:16.256 --> 25:19.216
met each other in 1935

25:19.259 --> 25:21.189
and steered their development
to ensure

25:21.228 --> 25:24.728
that the computer would be
brought out on schedule

25:24.765 --> 25:28.065
at the right time,
which is exactly what we see.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.607
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that extraterrestrials

25:33.640 --> 25:35.970
brought together
Turing and von Neumann

25:36.009 --> 25:40.039
to accelerate the development
of computer technology?

25:40.080 --> 25:43.850
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

25:43.884 --> 25:46.724
and suggest that
at the same time

25:46.753 --> 25:48.493
aliens were helping mankind

25:48.522 --> 25:52.592
to develop another
important technology,

25:52.626 --> 25:56.026
a rocket that would
reach the stars.

26:00.709 --> 26:02.739
NARRATOR:
Kaluga, Russia.

26:02.777 --> 26:05.647
December, 1903.

26:05.680 --> 26:10.150
Russian scientist
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky

26:10.185 --> 26:11.985
publishes the article

26:12.020 --> 26:17.120
"Exploration of Outer Space
by Means of Rocket Devices."

26:17.158 --> 26:20.988
Most scientists
of the time consider

26:21.029 --> 26:22.899
the topic of space exploration

26:22.931 --> 26:25.901
highly speculative
and even far-fetched,

26:25.934 --> 26:29.944
considering the Wright Brothers
had just achieved

26:29.971 --> 26:33.411
the first powered flight
that same month.

26:35.276 --> 26:36.836
But many of the major points

26:36.878 --> 26:39.878
contained in
Tsiolkovsky's article,

26:39.914 --> 26:42.454
such as the proposal
that the speed required

26:42.484 --> 26:46.124
for orbit around the Earth
is five miles per second

26:46.154 --> 26:50.594
and that this could be achieved
by means of a multistage rocket,

26:50.625 --> 26:54.085
would be proven
to be incredibly accurate.

26:56.498 --> 26:58.358
ANDREW JENKS:
He's a fascinating character

26:58.400 --> 27:00.370
and the father
of Soviet rocketry,

27:00.402 --> 27:02.372
who actually designed
the rockets

27:02.404 --> 27:03.774
that put the first man
into space,

27:03.805 --> 27:05.965
that put the first
dog into space,

27:06.007 --> 27:10.137
that launched <i> Sputnik,</i> the first
satellite, into space in 1957.

27:12.514 --> 27:15.354
NARRATOR: Tsiolkovsky's
main source of inspiration

27:15.383 --> 27:19.053
was his friend and mentor,
Nikolai Fyodorov,

27:19.087 --> 27:22.017
a Russian Orthodox
Christian philosopher.

27:25.293 --> 27:28.933
Fyodorov was one of
the founders of "cosmism,"

27:28.963 --> 27:32.833
which was a precursor
to ancient astronaut theory.

27:35.036 --> 27:38.036
JENKS: The cosmists began
with Nikolai Fyodorov

27:38.073 --> 27:41.313
in the 1870s and 1880s,
and they believed

27:41.342 --> 27:45.812
that human civilization actually
had origins, uh, in outer space

27:45.847 --> 27:48.817
and that it was our destiny
as human beings

27:48.850 --> 27:50.920
to move back into space,

27:50.952 --> 27:53.852
and we would go back to
our origins from whence we came.

27:57.959 --> 27:59.259
NARRATOR:
Like Fyodorov,

27:59.294 --> 28:02.934
Tsiolkovsky came to be
a cosmist himself.

28:02.964 --> 28:06.904
And he not only inspired
Soviet rocket scientists

28:06.935 --> 28:09.465
but also the genius responsible

28:09.504 --> 28:12.314
for putting the first man
on the moon,

28:12.340 --> 28:14.340
Wernher von Braun.

28:17.178 --> 28:19.178
Germany.

28:19.214 --> 28:21.884
May 1945.

28:21.916 --> 28:24.116
After six years

28:24.152 --> 28:27.522
of the deadliest warfare
the world has ever seen,

28:27.555 --> 28:31.915
the Nazis surrender
to the Allied Powers.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.060
Germany's top rocket scientist,

28:35.096 --> 28:38.826
Wernher von Braun, predicted
the defeat months earlier

28:38.867 --> 28:42.237
and by deceiving his superiors
has managed

28:42.270 --> 28:45.470
to move his team of scientists
south into Austria

28:45.507 --> 28:48.267
to surrender
to the American forces.

28:50.845 --> 28:54.205
Acquiring von Braun
was considered

28:54.249 --> 28:57.419
a major coup
by the United States.

28:57.452 --> 29:01.222
His work in rocketry
was so important

29:01.256 --> 29:04.256
that the Soviets scoured
his former headquarters

29:04.292 --> 29:07.062
at Peenemunde Army
Research Center

29:07.095 --> 29:11.395
in search of any information
he may have left behind.

29:11.432 --> 29:13.332
What they discovered

29:13.368 --> 29:16.268
were the writings
of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky

29:16.304 --> 29:19.144
and found that almost every page

29:19.174 --> 29:24.114
was embellished by
von Braun's comments and notes.

29:24.145 --> 29:25.475
WHITEHEAD:
Wernher von Braun

29:25.513 --> 29:28.313
was heavily influenced
by Tsiolkovsky.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.319
Tsiolkovsky himself
had this concept

29:30.351 --> 29:33.721
of human beings being
birthed in the stars.

29:33.755 --> 29:36.115
And if you really
think about it,

29:36.157 --> 29:40.027
could it be that these
scientists coming out of Russia

29:40.061 --> 29:42.031
had some kind
of advanced knowledge?

29:42.063 --> 29:44.163
Could they have
been communicating

29:44.199 --> 29:47.029
with some form of advanced
extraterrestrial intelligence

29:47.068 --> 29:49.498
that was influencing
the space race

29:49.537 --> 29:50.867
and influencing this push

29:50.905 --> 29:53.005
to get humanity
to go back to the stars?

29:55.410 --> 29:59.050
NARRATOR: As a young boy,
Wernher von Braun was fascinated

29:59.080 --> 30:03.320
with the science fiction
of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells

30:03.351 --> 30:05.921
and was convinced
that he could make

30:05.954 --> 30:08.724
their visions
of space travel a reality,

30:08.756 --> 30:12.256
even going so far
as to tell his mother

30:12.293 --> 30:16.663
that he would build a machine
that would take man to the moon.

30:16.698 --> 30:18.428
(indistinct radio chatter)

30:18.466 --> 30:23.436
But when von Braun actually
achieved this in 1969,

30:23.471 --> 30:26.441
it was such an extraordinary
technological leap

30:26.474 --> 30:29.784
that some people believed,
like Tsiolkovsky,

30:29.811 --> 30:33.811
he too was guided
by extraterrestrial beings.

30:37.285 --> 30:38.645
WILCOCK:
Wernher von Braun

30:38.686 --> 30:41.146
was utterly captivated
by the idea

30:41.189 --> 30:43.059
that we belong in the stars.

30:43.091 --> 30:46.391
It's as if the Earth is a seed,

30:46.427 --> 30:49.327
and if that seed
never germinates,

30:49.364 --> 30:51.964
then it could just die.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.470
We need to go out into space.

30:54.502 --> 30:58.272
And that vision
of a new tomorrow

30:58.306 --> 31:02.476
is what fueled him to want
to succeed even further.

31:02.510 --> 31:05.850
That leads me to suggest
the possibility

31:05.880 --> 31:08.310
that some sort of
extraterrestrial contact

31:08.349 --> 31:10.279
might have happened
with Wernher von Braun.

31:10.318 --> 31:13.048
Something or someone
might have reached him

31:13.087 --> 31:16.857
and saw where we needed
to go as a civilization

31:16.891 --> 31:20.661
and gave him the tools
and the insights that he needed

31:20.695 --> 31:23.525
to be able to build
our way out into space.

31:25.433 --> 31:26.773
NARRATOR:
Is it possible,

31:26.801 --> 31:29.571
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

31:29.604 --> 31:34.044
that Konstantin Tsiolkovsky
and Wernher von Braun

31:34.075 --> 31:38.175
were aided
by extraterrestrial beings?

31:38.212 --> 31:41.382
And if so, why?

31:41.416 --> 31:45.146
Perhaps the answer can be found
by examining the predictions

31:45.186 --> 31:50.086
not of science
but of science fiction.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.593
MAN:
How far out can you get?

31:56.623 --> 31:59.063
That's the big question
in television today,

31:59.092 --> 32:00.992
and CBS has the big answer.

32:01.027 --> 32:04.357
Its fabulous new series,
<i>Lost in Space.</i>

32:04.397 --> 32:08.527
NARRATOR: In 1965,
the CBS network announced

32:08.568 --> 32:10.338
the debut of what would become

32:10.370 --> 32:14.940
television's first prime-time
science fiction series.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.635
MAN: Wouldn't Dad like
to use this gadget

32:16.676 --> 32:18.676
to beat that thruway traffic?

32:18.712 --> 32:23.252
NARRATOR:
Set in the far-future of 1997,

32:23.283 --> 32:27.693
<i>Lost in Space</i> told the story
of a family of space colonists

32:27.721 --> 32:30.591
who become marooned
on an alien world.

32:30.623 --> 32:34.433
It underscored
America's growing acceptance

32:34.461 --> 32:38.601
that mankind's future
was not here on Earth

32:38.631 --> 32:41.571
but out in the vast reaches
of the galaxy.

32:41.601 --> 32:44.171
This trend continued

32:44.204 --> 32:48.044
when the following year
NBC premiered <i> Star Trek,</i>

32:48.074 --> 32:51.914
the epic saga
of a futuristic starship

32:51.945 --> 32:55.575
whose crew is charged
with exploring the galaxy,

32:55.615 --> 32:59.045
seeking out new life
and new civilizations,

32:59.085 --> 33:02.545
and going where no man--
or woman--

33:02.589 --> 33:04.859
had ever gone before.

33:04.891 --> 33:07.731
Interestingly,
both programs would appear

33:07.761 --> 33:09.891
in America's living rooms

33:09.929 --> 33:14.299
years before mankind would even
step foot on the moon.

33:14.334 --> 33:18.374
It is amazing that today
we are living in times

33:18.405 --> 33:21.135
where only 40, 50 years ago,

33:21.174 --> 33:23.814
people were fantasizing
about the future.

33:25.578 --> 33:29.648
And here we are experiencing
that said future.

33:29.682 --> 33:32.322
Not all of it, but many things.

33:32.352 --> 33:36.392
Where do we stand
50 years from now?

33:36.423 --> 33:40.593
I think science fiction
is a part of disclosure.

33:40.627 --> 33:45.527
Over time, science fiction
has become science fact.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.765
MAN:
Ignition sequence start.

33:48.802 --> 33:51.502
NARRATOR: Of course,
science fiction's role

33:51.538 --> 33:54.508
in pre-envisioning
what would ultimately become

33:54.541 --> 33:57.881
the world's "science fact"
was nothing new.

33:57.911 --> 34:02.451
Space stations,
intelligent robots,

34:02.482 --> 34:05.482
extraordinary
communication devices,

34:05.518 --> 34:08.288
Even <i> Star Wars-type</i>
space weapons

34:08.321 --> 34:11.420
were all pre-envisioned
in the creative minds

34:11.458 --> 34:16.228
of authors like Jules Verne,
H.G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke,

34:16.262 --> 34:19.831
Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury.

34:19.866 --> 34:23.266
And their works later
formed the basis

34:23.303 --> 34:26.203
for countless films
and television series.

34:27.774 --> 34:31.313
Great innovation has come
from science fiction literature.

34:31.344 --> 34:35.714
Arthur C. Clarke imagined the
satellite before the engineers.

34:35.748 --> 34:38.678
They were reading
science fiction

34:38.717 --> 34:40.688
when they came up
with the idea to do that.

34:40.719 --> 34:43.520
This has happened repeatedly
where a creative artist

34:43.556 --> 34:46.386
will come up with a new idea
just to tell a story,

34:46.426 --> 34:49.426
but it's coming
from the unconscious.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.331
I mean, look at Jules Verne.
Go back and read Jules Verne.

34:51.364 --> 34:52.664
It's really interesting.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.569
Like, a lot
of the stuff we made,

34:54.601 --> 34:56.630
like, he just thought it up.

34:56.668 --> 35:00.609
TSOUKALOS: And these ideas
sprung out of a man's mind,

35:00.640 --> 35:03.510
and it has become reality.

35:03.543 --> 35:05.483
And I think that
they've turned to reality

35:05.512 --> 35:08.712
because of young kids
reading these stories

35:08.748 --> 35:11.418
and eventually growing up
and realizing,

35:11.451 --> 35:12.921
"Wait a second.

35:12.952 --> 35:15.822
"We have all these
technological capabilities.

35:15.855 --> 35:17.355
"What if I can bring it

35:17.390 --> 35:19.790
to the next level
with a new invention?"

35:19.826 --> 35:26.026
So science fiction can serve
as a direct path to science

35:26.065 --> 35:30.325
that has been
inspired by fantasy.

35:30.370 --> 35:35.010
NARRATOR: But are many
of today's scientific wonders

35:35.041 --> 35:39.511
merely the product of fertile
minds and wild imaginations?

35:39.546 --> 35:43.406
Or do they have
their origins elsewhere,

35:43.449 --> 35:46.079
possibly light-years away?

35:48.154 --> 35:49.894
REDFERN:
There's an interesting theory,

35:49.923 --> 35:54.533
the idea that certain profound
science fiction writers

35:54.561 --> 35:56.891
may not have just simply
come up with the ideas

35:56.930 --> 36:00.400
for their stories on their own,
albeit they may have thought

36:00.433 --> 36:02.273
they came up with
the ideas on their own.

36:02.302 --> 36:05.472
Perhaps there was
an outside force

36:05.505 --> 36:07.365
presenting it to them.

36:07.407 --> 36:10.807
Have science fiction
authors and writers

36:10.843 --> 36:13.813
been inspired
by extraterrestrials?

36:18.017 --> 36:19.917
NARRATOR: Could
extraterrestrials have given

36:19.953 --> 36:24.793
humanity glimpses of its own
future through science fiction?

36:24.824 --> 36:28.294
And if the creative minds
of the past

36:28.328 --> 36:30.388
have been able to pre-envision

36:30.430 --> 36:33.660
the incredible technologies
of the present day,

36:33.700 --> 36:37.700
then should we also regard
the science fiction of today

36:37.737 --> 36:42.207
as a guide to where mankind
is headed next?

36:42.242 --> 36:45.382
Where do we stand
50 years from now?

36:45.411 --> 36:48.211
And if we're talking
about science fiction today,

36:48.248 --> 36:52.378
one recurring theme
is what happens

36:52.418 --> 36:55.318
if we gain the ability
to upload our consciousness

36:55.355 --> 36:57.585
to some type of a computer?

36:57.624 --> 37:02.134
Is it possible that our future
may lie in a digital realm?

37:02.161 --> 37:06.631
I would not want my thoughts
to be uploaded to a computer,

37:06.666 --> 37:09.926
because then
we really become glass.

37:09.969 --> 37:13.799
This planet will cease to exist
within two seconds

37:13.840 --> 37:15.870
if we all know
each other's thoughts.

37:15.908 --> 37:19.838
So there's a fine line
we have to walk

37:19.879 --> 37:23.879
between what can
and will ensure our future

37:23.916 --> 37:28.386
and what can and will be
our assured annihilation.

37:31.824 --> 37:35.334
NARRATOR: According to many
ancient astronaut theorists,

37:35.361 --> 37:37.831
the visions of a bleak future--

37:37.864 --> 37:40.834
as depicted in today's
science fiction--

37:40.867 --> 37:44.337
could, if realized,
prove as perilous

37:44.370 --> 37:46.940
as they once seemed profound.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.873
But they also suggest

37:48.908 --> 37:52.638
that the messages that mankind's
visionaries receive

37:52.679 --> 37:57.379
may not be dire predictions
as much as they are warnings.

37:57.417 --> 38:01.887
Warnings intended
to help mankind

38:01.921 --> 38:03.791
avoid annihilation.

38:08.920 --> 38:13.520
NARRATOR: Today the theorems
of Srinivasa Ramanujan

38:13.558 --> 38:16.658
are being applied in branches
of physics that may allow us

38:16.695 --> 38:20.095
to unlock the greatest mysteries
of the cosmos.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.497
The computer models

38:24.536 --> 38:27.536
established by Alan Turing
and John von Neumann

38:27.572 --> 38:32.042
have advanced human technology
by leaps and bounds.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.577
The advances in rocketry

38:34.612 --> 38:38.722
made by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky
and Wernher von Braun

38:38.750 --> 38:43.750
have allowed for
greater exploration of space.

38:43.788 --> 38:49.058
And Steve Jobs' contributions
to the microcomputer revolution

38:49.094 --> 38:51.834
have put all of the world's
collective knowledge

38:51.863 --> 38:53.703
at our fingertips.

38:57.569 --> 39:00.969
But has the work of
these visionaries and others

39:01.006 --> 39:05.036
really been directed by an
extraterrestrial intelligence?

39:05.076 --> 39:09.206
And if so, to what end?

39:13.852 --> 39:17.822
We have been the experiment of,
I believe, extraterrestrials.

39:17.856 --> 39:22.156
I think they have nurtured us
to see how we develop.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.763
And they're probably saying,

39:24.796 --> 39:27.626
"Gosh, look at these humans,
look how fast they can advance."

39:27.665 --> 39:29.725
And we're getting better
and better and better

39:29.768 --> 39:31.628
with technology.

39:31.669 --> 39:35.669
But Elon Musk from Tesla
and physicist Stephen Hawking

39:35.707 --> 39:39.577
all warn us, "Be careful
of artificial intelligence.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.081
It could go too far."

39:41.112 --> 39:43.752
I agree with them.
We need to be careful.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.654
CHILDRESS:
Something too that comes out

39:48.686 --> 39:51.516
of a lot of the UFO literature
of the '50s and '60s,

39:51.556 --> 39:54.516
that extraterrestrials were

39:54.559 --> 39:57.589
allegedly contacting
certain people

39:57.629 --> 40:00.659
and warning them of the dangers
of nuclear power

40:00.698 --> 40:05.568
and that what we were doing
with our atomic weapons

40:05.603 --> 40:07.773
was very destructive

40:07.806 --> 40:11.636
and that we could destroy our
own planet with this technology

40:11.676 --> 40:13.676
and that the extraterrestrials
themselves

40:13.711 --> 40:15.241
were very concerned about this.

40:17.715 --> 40:21.545
And so, in many ways,
we must be very careful

40:21.586 --> 40:25.916
of how we use
our own technology.

40:25.957 --> 40:30.527
TSOUKALOS: There's a reason
why we are where we are today.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.562
We have made
these advances in technology

40:33.598 --> 40:36.128
for one and one reason only...

40:39.237 --> 40:42.237
...to return to the stars,

40:42.273 --> 40:44.243
because that's where
we came from.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.005
And now the question is:

40:49.047 --> 40:52.877
are we going to fulfill
our destiny or not?

40:52.917 --> 40:55.247
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

40:55.286 --> 40:57.616
that humanity's
greatest visionaries

40:57.655 --> 41:00.355
have been unknowingly
carrying out

41:00.391 --> 41:03.861
some sort of extraterrestrial
master plan?

41:03.895 --> 41:07.125
One intended to prepare mankind

41:07.165 --> 41:09.225
for the ultimate
"close encounter"?

41:09.267 --> 41:12.737
And if so, does this mean

41:12.770 --> 41:16.810
that our future has been
somehow predetermined?

41:16.841 --> 41:20.811
Or are we simply being
given the tools

41:20.845 --> 41:23.845
with which to shape
our own destiny?

41:23.882 --> 41:26.052
Perhaps the answer can be found

41:26.084 --> 41:29.754
in the pages
of a science fiction book,

41:29.787 --> 41:34.517
in the palm of our hand
within a simple cell phone,

41:34.559 --> 41:39.359
or in the latest
robotic technology.

41:39.397 --> 41:42.327
Perhaps it is carved
on the stone walls

41:42.367 --> 41:45.097
of an as-yet-undiscovered tomb.

41:45.136 --> 41:48.666
Or even as we sit,

41:48.706 --> 41:51.836
right before our eyes.
