00:12.513 --> 00:14.766
Alamogordo New Mexico.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.685
A small town, about
30,000 people

00:17.976 --> 00:20.274
but it seems to attract
more than its fair share

00:20.562 --> 00:22.860
of strange occurrences.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.741
It's right around the
corner from where they

00:25.025 --> 00:26.777
tested the first atomic bomb.

00:30.572 --> 00:34.122
It's also the grave site of
Ham, the first chimpanzee...

00:34.409 --> 00:38.585
and really, the first
American... to go into space.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.216
And it's the place where
this guy broke the land

00:41.500 --> 00:43.252
speed record in a rocket sled.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.172
Which is cool, but
also kind of strange.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.520
Despite all of this, the
thing that Alamogordo is

00:53.804 --> 00:56.523
best known for is its landfill.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.230
The dump.

00:59.518 --> 01:04.819
Because supposedly, that's where
Atari buried E.T., the worst

01:05.107 --> 01:07.155
video game of all time.

01:11.113 --> 01:14.617
<i>It's been described
as the worst video game ever.</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:16.285
E.T. for Atari.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.921
Today we're going to talk
about the worst of the worst.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.003
Here's our top 10
worst games ever.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.134
ET, the Extra Terrestrial.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.670
Now here's the
thing about ET, it's

01:25.961 --> 01:28.305
widely regarded as the worst
video game of all time.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.841
Worst game ever.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.136
Here We have this myth,
or this legend of something

01:33.427 --> 01:34.770
that happened 40 years ago.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.897
Do
do do do do do do do do.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.355
Son of a bitch, get out
of the fucking hole.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.020
If you grab a
piece of the phone,

01:43.312 --> 01:44.609
the FBI agent keeps
attacking you.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.273
And if you take a
step in any direction,

01:46.565 --> 01:47.942
you fall into a hole.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.735
And if you get out of the
hole, you fall right back down.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.496
One of the
major design flaws of the games

01:52.779 --> 01:54.998
was that ET fell into pits.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.153
Dammit.

01:56.241 --> 01:56.907
Shit.

01:56.908 --> 01:57.759
Oh, come on.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.453
And guess what.

01:59.745 --> 02:03.420
It now lives out it's
days in a landfill.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.335
It's rumored that decades
ago, truckloads of that game

02:06.627 --> 02:09.130
were dumped in the
Alamogordo landfill.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.173
The idea that they had
so many of these things,

02:11.465 --> 02:14.469
and they were so unable to sell
them, give them away, Whatever,

02:14.760 --> 02:16.228
they literally had
to drive them out

02:16.511 --> 02:17.763
into the middle of the desert,
and bury them like a gangster.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.728
It's almost too
crazy to be believed.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.358
I think it's kind of silly.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.859
Because it's urban legend.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.862
It's just a great
story, I think.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.148
I
believe that this story

02:28.440 --> 02:32.365
endures because the
adults just don't get it.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.246
And that's satisfying
to young people.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.906
HOWARD SCOTT'
Whenever you

02:36.198 --> 02:39.168
look at what the reasons are
for it, nothing makes sense.

02:39.451 --> 02:43.797
What drove someone to need to
hide this stuff so intensely?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.894
When I was five
years old, Pong came out.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.147
And my dad got it for me
and my brother and sister.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.182
When the Atari 2600 came out...

03:02.474 --> 03:03.646
Atari!

03:03.934 --> 03:04.810
...I got
every cartridge

03:05.102 --> 03:05.978
I could get my hands on.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.112
I played it constantly.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.822
Atari was like Xbox and
PlayStation rolled into one.

03:12.109 --> 03:17.491
It had an 80% market share, and
the 2600 was its killer app.

03:17.781 --> 03:22.503
Adventure was probably my
favorite game on the 2600.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.003
I spent three weeks
sitting in front

03:24.287 --> 03:26.631
of my TV trying to find
the first Easter egg

03:26.915 --> 03:29.043
ever hidden in a video game.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.677
It looks kind of stupid now.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.634
You were just a block, who
picked up an invisible dot,

03:32.921 --> 03:34.468
and carried it into
the special room

03:34.756 --> 03:36.258
to discover the
programmer's name.

03:36.550 --> 03:41.226
But to me, finding that hidden
screen was like a revelation.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.811
As an adult, I still play
a lot of video games.

03:44.099 --> 03:47.273
But I also write and direct
movies, that's my job.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.904
I've worked on a lot
of big comic book

03:49.187 --> 03:52.111
movies, the kind they make
shitty video games out of.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.824
And I even wrote some of
the shitty video games.

03:56.111 --> 03:59.581
But I'm also fascinated by
myths and urban legends.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.742
In fact, 10 years ago, me
and this guy Werner Herzog

04:02.033 --> 04:04.331
went to Scotland to find
the Loch Ness Monster.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.088
We never did find
Nessie, but I still

04:07.372 --> 04:12.003
love an adventure, especially
to unravel an urban legend.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.546
Today, video games
are everywhere,

04:13.837 --> 04:16.386
so it might be hard to
understand my generation's

04:16.673 --> 04:18.266
obsession with Atari.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.644
But for us, it was the gateway
drug to a lifelong addiction

04:21.928 --> 04:22.929
to video games.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.395
And then one day
it was just gone.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.482
Sometime in the mid '80s,
it just disappeared.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.738
And there were no
more Atari games.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.899
And I always wondered
what happened.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.569
Where did it go?

04:36.860 --> 04:37.736
So this is the famous landfall.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.154
Yeah.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.538
The burial... the final
resting ground of E.T..

04:40.822 --> 04:41.614
Yeah.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.083
This is the place.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.869
This road here, this gate, this
is exactly the way the Ataris

04:46.161 --> 04:47.287
would have came through.

04:47.579 --> 04:48.626
Through that ditch,
and up through here.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.416
This was the only access in.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.380
Back in those days, it
was just pure desert.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.884
And is there any way
to get through this,

04:54.169 --> 04:55.170
or are we, I mean...

04:55.462 --> 04:56.429
Well, yeah, it's a
high security gate.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.584
Just duck under.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.498
Yeah, I guess that works.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.557
Ha, ha, ha

04:59.841 --> 05:01.263
Joe Lewandowski's

05:01.551 --> 05:03.178
been the garbage guru, if you
will, for a number of years.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.440
He operated various
waste disposal companies

05:06.723 --> 05:08.350
within Alamogordo
and Otero county.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.394
And when it comes to
the Atari graveyard,

05:10.685 --> 05:12.608
I believe he probably
has more direct knowledge

05:12.896 --> 05:13.897
of anybody else.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.406
Joe's the guy that's
advising the city,

05:15.690 --> 05:17.488
and telling the city
where everything is.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.279
And I think that he's the only
guy that might be able to walk

05:20.570 --> 05:23.039
out to that dump, and point to
a spot on the ground, and say,

05:23.323 --> 05:24.540
this is where it's at.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.455
So, so this whole area,
this is where it's buried?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.418
Some people don't believe
it's there, but trust me,

05:30.705 --> 05:31.601
it's there.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.607
You can kind of feel it.
Right?

05:32.791 --> 05:33.662
It that just me?

05:33.750 --> 05:34.672
Ah, that's pretty much you.

05:34.960 --> 05:35.761
It's just me.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.761
So what are these
little boxes, here?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.016
Each one of those boxes
represents where garbage is.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.222
I see.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.932
Someone would write
down, oh, that's

05:45.220 --> 05:46.642
where we put the Atari trash.

05:46.930 --> 05:47.772
That's where we put, you know.

05:48.056 --> 05:48.889
That's the problem.

05:48.890 --> 05:49.682
Nobody did.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.026
We do today.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.687
So it's looking for... it's
like looking for a haystack

05:53.979 --> 05:55.151
in a pile of haystacks.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.690
Pretty much.

05:56.982 --> 05:57.878
And then looking for the
needle inside that haystack.

05:58.066 --> 05:58.892
And find the needle.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.406
So it's two levels.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.991
This picture, here, is actually
out of an old El Paso Times

06:02.279 --> 06:03.371
article.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.497
This is actually that
day, and that event,

06:04.781 --> 06:06.158
when it actually occurred.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.792
So what we did, is
just to figure out,

06:08.076 --> 06:10.955
OK, if this reporter
took this picture here,

06:11.246 --> 06:12.338
then the reporter
had to be standing

06:12.622 --> 06:14.044
somewhere in this area.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.926
So here's the two cells that
we've pinned it down to, now.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.837
So when you come
back here, and put

06:19.129 --> 06:22.554
the reporter taking the
picture, and you make that line.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.060
And what you're looking for,
is to make sure the line

06:25.343 --> 06:27.516
intersects with the buildings.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.397
Joe Lewandowski
wasn't just a guy

06:29.681 --> 06:31.274
who knew his way around a dump.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.311
He was also an
amateur archaeologist,

06:34.603 --> 06:38.653
kind of like Indiana
Jones, but without the gun.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.238
Or the whip.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.325
See, the newspaper photo
was like the medallion,

06:44.613 --> 06:47.162
and Joe had used it to
construct his own version

06:47.449 --> 06:48.575
of the Staff of Ra.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.744
And that pinpointed the
location of the Atari

06:51.036 --> 06:54.757
dump, which is exactly how
Indy would have done it.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.088
Joe was clearly obsessed.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.422
He believed in the legend.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.758
He'd spent over three
years constructing

07:01.046 --> 07:04.767
a plan to dig up the landfill,
and prove it to the world.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.267
But he wasn't a gamer.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.849
He wasn't trying
to find out why.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.310
And that's what
I wanted to know.

07:11.598 --> 07:15.319
Why would the company I loved so
much decide to bury its future?

07:19.272 --> 07:25.245
The whole ET story is a very
small part of the Atari story.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.951
Let me go back and let me
explain how Atari started out.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.584
The video game
came because of the convergence

07:31.868 --> 07:34.417
of me working in an
amusement park summers,

07:34.704 --> 07:36.172
while pursuing an
engineering degree

07:36.456 --> 07:38.049
at the University of Utah.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.803
I knew the economics of the
coin operated game business.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.260
They made a lot of money.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.721
Nolan designed
these incredibly elegant

07:48.009 --> 07:49.431
circuits.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.268
Put together in a way that's
so clever that modern engineers

07:52.555 --> 07:54.432
have a hard time, you
know, understanding

07:54.724 --> 07:55.725
and repairing these things.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.315
My partner and I,
Ted Dabney, started

07:58.603 --> 07:59.855
working on a ping-pong game.

08:02.941 --> 08:06.616
By the end of '72,
we did $3.5 million.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.997
And then we did $19 million.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.873
Then we did $35 million.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.251
It was a hockey stick.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.664
This electronic medium,
which was just beginning,

08:16.955 --> 08:18.548
had some traction with people.

08:18.832 --> 08:22.553
And once you played some of the
more sophisticated arcade games

08:22.836 --> 08:24.554
of the day, and understood
that maybe there

08:24.838 --> 08:28.217
was a chance you could
duplicate that in a home game,

08:28.508 --> 08:29.725
your eyes got big.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.512
Home video
games have been a success

08:31.803 --> 08:34.101
from the moment a
company called Atari

08:34.389 --> 08:36.767
launched this basic game, Pong.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.982
Which has been imitated by at
least 40 other manufacturers.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.772
They are selling like crazy.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.157
300,000 last year.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.943
This year, three million.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.828
Next year, six,
maybe 10 million.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.786
We felt, well, maybe
this is a time to sell

08:52.073 --> 08:53.916
to a company with deep pockets.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.453
I was in my office
at Warner in 1976.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.089
The phone rang, and it was
a guy named Gordy Crawford,

08:59.372 --> 09:01.090
and he asked the question
I've never forgotten.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.674
Would you guys be interested in
acquiring a technology based,

09:04.961 --> 09:06.338
fast growing
entertainment company?

09:06.629 --> 09:07.846
And I said yes.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.725
I didn't know what I said
yes to, but I said yes.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.637
And that led to my
introduction to Atari.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.477
Atari, where
the future comes from.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.518
What excited
me about Atari wasn't Pong,

09:19.809 --> 09:23.063
it was the chipset that
led to the Atari 2,600.

09:23.354 --> 09:27.359
Pong was sort of OK, you banged
up and back, and up and back.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.494
But this meant you could
constantly change the games.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.282
And that was a
very exciting idea.

09:33.573 --> 09:38.573
We introduced the 2600 in
1977, with nine cartridges.

09:45.335 --> 09:49.135
The home video game was a
very close approximation

09:49.422 --> 09:51.049
of the coin-op experience.

09:53.802 --> 09:58.148
It changed
the mindset of the world.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.603
Turning the television

09:59.891 --> 10:02.986
from a passive medium into
an active medium, that

10:03.269 --> 10:04.737
was what we knew we were doing.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.865
And that was super exciting to
be the pioneers in that field.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.243
It just blew people away.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.369
Nobody knew any this stuff.

10:11.653 --> 10:12.524
They made it up as they went.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.483
And they were good at it.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.744
And it started everything.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.912
It was playing
those games that taught people

10:20.203 --> 10:22.205
the potential of a computer.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.626
Atari,
at some level,

10:25.917 --> 10:26.884
brought the computer revolution.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.188
They
started experimentally

10:38.471 --> 10:40.644
hiring smart kids, with this
idea that maybe they can

10:40.932 --> 10:44.027
come up with other stuff to do.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.859
And they inadvertently
were trying to create

10:47.147 --> 10:48.194
the job of game designer.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.366
Microprocessor real
time control programming

10:54.654 --> 10:55.780
is just where it's at.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.324
So, there's two kinds of
things you typically do

10:57.615 --> 10:59.288
with that in the early 1980s.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.419
You can do missile
guidance systems...

11:01.703 --> 11:04.923
or like we say, kill
people for 12 cents a head.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.753
Or you could make
video games, which

11:07.041 --> 11:08.293
I thought was a much
better application

11:08.585 --> 11:11.384
for the whole thing.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.675
What went on at
Atari from the very beginning

11:14.966 --> 11:16.593
was, basically, that
the engineers are

11:16.885 --> 11:17.886
going to drive this company.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.270
Because they weren't
just engineers.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.646
They were creative guys.

11:20.930 --> 11:24.810
They're like musicians,
or movie directors.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.728
They're artists.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.068
Through
luck, or providence, or both,

11:29.355 --> 11:31.483
they ended up with this
department of game designers

11:31.774 --> 11:33.947
that became this
dream team at Atari.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.364
These guys who made all of
these classics... Tempest,

11:37.655 --> 11:40.499
and Asteroids, and Centipede,
and Gauntlet, and, you know,

11:40.783 --> 11:41.830
think of a game.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.085
The
culture was these guys

11:43.369 --> 11:44.712
do what they want to do.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.464
One day, I was standing in
the men's room, at a urinal,

11:46.748 --> 11:50.719
and I looked down, and I saw a
pair of bare feet next to me.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.972
And I look, and here is a
guy wearing a pair of shorts,

11:54.255 --> 11:56.303
and nothing else.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.638
And I said something.

11:57.926 --> 11:58.759
And they said, oh
yeah, that's so and so.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.611
He's a great engineer.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.928
He doesn't like to wear clothes.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.851
The coin-op engineers at
Atari, they were great.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.145
And on the consumer
side, Howard was

12:08.436 --> 12:09.688
one of the best programmers.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.482
He was one of the best
of those engineers.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.321
At the heart
of the creative process

12:14.609 --> 12:16.077
is the programmer.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.831
I try to create, basically, a
sensory experience that evokes

12:20.114 --> 12:21.286
a certain feeling in the user.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.622
I mean, I tend to
program from a concept.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.163
I mean, it was... I
was made for this.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.377
I mean, was is what
I was made to do.

12:31.542 --> 12:35.592
January 11, 1981, I showed
up for my first day of work

12:35.880 --> 12:37.882
as a game programmer at Atari.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.804
So, do you remember the
first day you showed up here?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.312
Absolutely.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.146
My first office mates were
Tod Frye and Rob Zdybel.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.605
And I had an
understanding that there

12:48.893 --> 12:50.691
was a lot of dope
that was smoked

12:50.979 --> 12:52.401
at Atari, when we were there.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.657
And so on my first day at work,
I brought a joint, because I

12:54.941 --> 12:56.193
didn't want to be, you know...

12:56.484 --> 12:57.827
Yeah.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.330
I wanted to be a courteous
guest, and so I showed up...

13:00.613 --> 13:01.660
Which by the way,
this is a good lesson

13:01.948 --> 13:03.291
for our younger viewers.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.544
If people are doing drugs,
bring your own, so you fit in.

13:06.828 --> 13:11.129
Tod walks
in, shuts the door, and says,

13:11.416 --> 13:12.633
I'm going to get high
in here, so if you

13:12.917 --> 13:14.260
don't want to be around
this, you'd better leave.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.466
No, actually, here, I said.

13:15.753 --> 13:16.879
I brought a joint.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.969
And he sort of looked
at me and he went pbtt.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.349
I'm going to smoke real stuff.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.504
OK?

13:21.592 --> 13:22.443
That was my introduction.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.514
That was my first day at work.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.354
We wanted
people who worked hard, and yet

13:28.641 --> 13:30.484
had fun at doing it.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.863
How do we mix up, so that
we don't know the difference

13:34.147 --> 13:35.273
between our work and our play?

13:35.565 --> 13:38.239
The company's motto was,
we take fun seriously.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.325
But we used to say, we
take fun intravenously.

13:41.612 --> 13:44.035
And they didn't
like that very much.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.416
No, I don't know why.

13:45.700 --> 13:49.796
The party atmosphere
was actually

13:50.079 --> 13:52.923
calculated plan to incentivize.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.379
I would set quotas.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.261
If the quotas were met,
I'd throw a kegger.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.172
They
would just roll out in the car,

13:59.464 --> 14:00.716
go to a liquor store,
and they gave someone

14:01.007 --> 14:02.384
a company credit
card, and they came

14:02.675 --> 14:04.393
back with a bunch of booze.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.929
And we consumed it.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.018
Over there is where
the hot tub was.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.434
Inside, on the first floor,
there's some great stuff

14:10.725 --> 14:11.817
that went on in that room.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.569
Over here, here's the
hill that you know,

14:13.853 --> 14:15.196
one day I was wearing
a dashiki shirt, which

14:15.480 --> 14:16.527
I was very into back then.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.532
And I would do
somersaults down the hill.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.444
I might have had some cocktails
that afternoon, at that point.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.205
Did you know that you were
entering this crazy party

14:24.489 --> 14:25.360
atmosphere, that you'd be?

14:25.448 --> 14:26.665
No.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.078
Even though I was told I
was, I had no expectation

14:30.370 --> 14:32.338
that it could really exist.

14:32.622 --> 14:33.794
The
best recruiting tool

14:34.082 --> 14:37.006
we could have for an
engineer, was to bring

14:37.293 --> 14:38.590
him over to one of our parties.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.221
Hey, What's happening, people?

14:40.505 --> 14:41.552
Hey, how's it going?

14:41.839 --> 14:43.056
What's happening?

14:43.341 --> 14:45.139
And they
thought, hey, I'm a nerd.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.099
There are girls here.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.855
They're talking to me.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.034
It's good.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.349
That was the culture.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.642
These guys are the
lifeblood of the business,

14:52.934 --> 14:53.935
and they do what
they want to do.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.570
And that's fine.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.820
In some ways,

14:57.105 --> 14:58.197
things happened to
me over the course

14:58.481 --> 15:00.324
of three and a half
years here, that made

15:00.608 --> 15:02.827
the next 25 years really tough.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.488
Because it
established a standard

15:04.779 --> 15:07.749
of what professional life,
and life in general, could be.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.284
And I never let
go of the thought

15:09.575 --> 15:11.327
that my life could
still be this or better.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.589
I just didn't know how to do it.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.874
It's really intense for
me to come back here.

15:17.166 --> 15:21.296
This is the first time I've
been back here in 30 years.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.761
And this was the place
where I was introduced

15:25.049 --> 15:28.019
to what life could be, for me.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.428
What a working life could be.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.473
What real creative
satisfaction could be.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.608
What doing something
really meaningful could be.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.317
Those are all things that come
back to me in this moment.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.778
And it's just...
it's very intense.

15:42.066 --> 15:45.195
So what really
happened back in 1983?

15:45.486 --> 15:47.284
People heard the
rumors, but Atari denied

15:47.572 --> 15:49.574
the dump ever took place.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.164
And eventually, people
forgot about it.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.829
But with the growth
of the internet,

15:54.120 --> 15:57.374
and all of its best and worst
lists, E.T. and its burial

15:57.665 --> 16:02.546
went from small town gossip
to full blown urban legend.

16:02.837 --> 16:05.966
By the mid '90s, videos begin
to appear online that seemed

16:06.257 --> 16:09.477
to suggest that anyone with a
shovel go out in the desert,

16:09.760 --> 16:11.762
and dig up the buried games.

16:12.054 --> 16:16.309
That's what I thought too, but
it wasn't close to that easy.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.070
Joe had spent years
researching the burial.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.196
If his information
was correct, the games

16:21.481 --> 16:22.858
were not only deep
underground, they

16:23.149 --> 16:25.117
were covered with concrete.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.904
Joe was still wading
through a sea of red tape.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.039
But if and when the
city approved his plan

16:30.323 --> 16:33.122
to excavate the landfill,
he was going to need

16:33.409 --> 16:35.002
more than just a shovel.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.210
He would need giant
yellow digging machines.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.672
And a bunch of guys in hats
and vests to operate them.

16:41.959 --> 16:45.805
This is one of the
photos of the actual burial,

16:46.088 --> 16:47.556
when they did it.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.434
So we're looking at, like, 15
feet down, to hit the concrete.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.345
Under the concrete
is mostly dirt.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.889
It's just the... it's
the bottom of the pit.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.648
What's that thing,
right over there?

16:55.932 --> 16:56.808
That's a motor grader.

16:57.099 --> 16:57.916
A motor grader?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.101
Yes.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.986
That's for, really,
just fine grading.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.272
You know, like the
highways and roads.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.362
And fine planing large areas.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.744
So, we conceivably might
need that, for this, right?

17:09.654 --> 17:10.278
No.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.096
No.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.497
I mean, but you
might... you could

17:12.781 --> 17:14.750
bring it out before, right?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.752
I mean, you might want to
park it there so it's ready.

17:17.118 --> 17:17.911
No, not really.

17:17.912 --> 17:18.578
No.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.371
We're fine.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.163
I don't know.

17:20.164 --> 17:20.964
Not my field.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.258
I am
concerned that Joe's

17:26.546 --> 17:27.923
moving kind of quick.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.216
And we do need to throw some
brakes on, and slow it down.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.102
The opposition comes
from environmentalists,

17:33.386 --> 17:34.478
maybe within the community.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.106
And the concern is
that Alamogordo also

17:37.390 --> 17:39.233
may have something else
buried in the landfill that

17:39.517 --> 17:40.769
may be hazardous.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.233
And we may not know exactly
where this location is.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.943
Nobody
really and truly

17:45.231 --> 17:47.654
has dead honest
records as to where

17:47.942 --> 17:49.114
everything is buried out there.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.450
And we're talking
potential mercury laced

17:51.737 --> 17:54.115
pigs, malathion, possibly DDT.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.579
There's potentially
lead in there,

17:55.866 --> 17:57.493
and maybe some other
dangerous metals

17:57.785 --> 17:59.503
that are in those cartridges.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.165
I don't want to be in an area
where we might crack open

18:02.456 --> 18:06.381
a sealed tomb, so to
speak, of these hogs, where

18:06.669 --> 18:08.512
mercury the gas comes out.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.798
So I don't want the
Stephen King novel of,

18:11.090 --> 18:12.933
we hit the wrong spot,
and all of the sudden

18:13.217 --> 18:14.935
we are evacuating Alamogordo.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.766
That is unacceptable.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.728
If there's
a problem that the New Mexico

18:20.016 --> 18:21.939
Environmental
Department perceives,

18:22.226 --> 18:24.479
we're not going to
be able to proceed.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.864
Until I'm satisfied it's
safe, it's not going to happen.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.071
At least within my power.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.360
You know, there's only so
much power that I have.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.785
So, for my first game,

18:39.076 --> 18:42.876
they wanted me to do
a coin-op conversion.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.837
Although I had only
been there for about

18:45.124 --> 18:47.343
a week, I went to my manager,
and I said, you know something?

18:47.627 --> 18:50.597
I said this game, Star
Castle, on the 2600

18:50.880 --> 18:51.881
is just going to suck.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.595
I know it's going to suck.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.136
And I said, but I think I can
take some of the key things

18:56.427 --> 19:00.773
that I think make it fun
game, and re-work it so

19:01.057 --> 19:04.106
that it would work on the 2600.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.395
And so they said, OK, go ahead.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.030
Do what you want to do.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.440
So, how did you
learn how to program a game?

19:09.732 --> 19:10.904
I just read the manual

19:11.192 --> 19:13.536
and started writing the game.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.742
No one had ever done, like, a
backstory for a game before.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.247
And I thought, this
is my first game,

19:17.531 --> 19:19.784
and I want to be involved
in every part of it.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.625
And I want to make it the best
thing it could possibly be.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.209
So I wrote this, like,
seven, eight page story.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.840
I stayed up all night
just writing this story.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.045
Knocked it out.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.755
And it was a science
fiction story

19:29.043 --> 19:30.636
about flies that get on the
first interstellar spaceships,

19:30.920 --> 19:33.719
and mutate, and evolve, and
take over the solar system.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.929
But now they're under attack by
this other monster, and stuff.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.720
And that's the short
version of the story.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.558
So I thought, well,
I need to name it.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.190
So what I did, was I named
it Yar, because that's

19:43.474 --> 19:44.475
Ray spelled backwards.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.269
And Ray Kassar was
the CEO of Atari.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.652
Right?

19:47.937 --> 19:49.780
So I've got his name
keyed into the title.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.692
And I thought, revenge,
great action word.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.656
You know, so that's compelling.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.867
And so that's how it
became Yar's Revenge.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.337
When Yar's Revenge
came out, it was a hit.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.668
It was huge.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.754
Games that could look
like Yar's Revenge

20:09.041 --> 20:10.634
looked... that could draw
that kind of stuff...

20:10.918 --> 20:12.295
were, like, magical.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.213
Even though Yar's Revenge might
look primitive... you know,

20:14.505 --> 20:16.633
it looks like a
superconducting super collider

20:16.924 --> 20:18.426
compared to a lot
of the games that

20:18.718 --> 20:19.935
were out there at the time.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.070
I remember the first time
I put the cartridge in,

20:21.262 --> 20:22.514
and I was like, what is this?

20:22.805 --> 20:25.274
It really is a very innovative
shooter of that era.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.775
Getting
a ship to fly around.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.231
So it's fun just to
fly the ship around.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.112
It was a trick, especially
on that hardware.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.864
The enemy was cool and scary.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.401
And it felt really
good to defeat it.

20:34.692 --> 20:38.117
You feel like it's your victory
when you beat those challenges.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.452
And you feel like it's your
defeat when they beat you.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.663
And you keep coming
back, because you

20:42.950 --> 20:44.293
didn't lose by being cheated.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.749
You didn't lose because the
game did something unfair.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.879
You lost because you
weren't quite good enough.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.713
And all of the great games
sit right on that edge.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.549
I remember playing
Yar's Revenge one day,

20:53.836 --> 20:56.680
and we happened on
trick that let you...

20:56.964 --> 20:58.841
if you were on this right spot
at the right time in the game,

20:59.133 --> 21:01.682
and it was in between levels...
these initials came up.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.346
And the initials were HSW.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.809
To us, it was some
weird mystery.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.349
And like, we had to
figure out what HSW meant.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.892
And finally, in one
of the game magazines,

21:08.184 --> 21:09.481
they published what HSW meant.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.737
Turns out, HSW means
Howard Scott Warshaw,

21:12.021 --> 21:12.943
the guy who made the game.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.982
Yar's Revenge
was the first game

21:15.274 --> 21:17.652
that Atari ever did, where
the programmer's name

21:17.943 --> 21:19.286
went outwith the cartridge.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.163
Yar's Revenge had
a lot of firsts,

21:21.447 --> 21:22.824
and that was just one of them.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.038
Yar's Revenge is
the bestselling original game

21:25.326 --> 21:26.578
for the Atari 2600.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.917
It sold something
like a million copies.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.502
Every reviewer at
the time thought

21:30.790 --> 21:32.838
Yar's Revenge was one of the
best games Atari put out.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.425
You know it made a lot
of money for Atari.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.760
In 1981,
this was a company

21:39.048 --> 21:44.020
that made operating profits of
something like $375 million.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.101
One of today's greatest
marketing triumphs

21:46.388 --> 21:48.732
in the entertainment
field is video games.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.233
It was
beyond comprehension.

21:50.518 --> 21:53.271
The fastest growing company
in American history.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.064
This was an explosion.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.733
Even those of us who
were in the middle of it

21:57.024 --> 22:00.153
were shaking our heads, going,
oh my god, this is amazing.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.242
We were the most
successful coin-op company,

22:02.530 --> 22:05.249
we were the dominant
consumer company.

22:05.533 --> 22:10.710
And we sat around literally
saying to ourselves,

22:10.996 --> 22:12.168
what are the
categories of games?

22:12.456 --> 22:13.924
What are the
capabilities of the 2600?

22:14.208 --> 22:16.552
Where is this industry going?

22:16.836 --> 22:17.962
Everything that Joe

22:18.254 --> 22:21.929
has put together on this
Atari graveyard, so far,

22:22.216 --> 22:23.342
seems to be coming true.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.636
I'm in favor of the
Atari games being dug up,

22:25.928 --> 22:29.307
because it is the largest
myth in the gaming world.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.850
I believe that Joe
just thinks it would

22:31.141 --> 22:33.360
be an outstanding
event for Alamogordo,

22:33.644 --> 22:34.941
and a way to get us on the map.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.448
On Tuesday,
Alamogordo's city commission

22:37.731 --> 22:39.608
approved a deal to dig
in the old landfill

22:39.900 --> 22:41.402
within the next six months.

22:41.694 --> 22:42.911
The city
has given its OK,

22:43.195 --> 22:45.072
and now the state has
given them approval.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.366
Film crews will
be in Alamogordo.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.035
The documentary
film crews will

22:49.326 --> 22:51.875
start probing the dump for
their strange buried treasure

22:52.162 --> 22:53.038
at 9:30 AM.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.227
So, this is an
impressive looking machine

23:07.511 --> 23:08.382
out here.

23:08.470 --> 23:09.892
What the hell is it doing?

23:10.180 --> 23:11.648
What's this drilling rig does,
it goes down, straight down,

23:11.932 --> 23:13.149
and takes out core
samples, and brings

23:13.434 --> 23:15.937
up whatever's in the ground.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.230
We've narrowed it down
from 300 acres down

23:18.522 --> 23:20.320
to about 5 to 10 acres.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.827
And so, What we're doing now is
trying to get it even closer.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.828
We're looking for things
like somebody's mail...

23:25.112 --> 23:27.865
you know, the postmarks...
newspapers, things like that.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.124
Looking for dates.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.375
We're looking for
September of '83.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.718
Don't you think
people are going

23:40.002 --> 23:41.049
to be disappointed
if we dig it up,

23:41.337 --> 23:42.930
and we don't actually
find the ET games?

23:43.213 --> 23:44.385
I mean, wouldn't that be?

23:44.673 --> 23:45.595
That would be very
disappointing for all of us.

23:45.883 --> 23:46.930
All the work.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.092
Three years of work
put into this thing.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.561
So what do we do then?

23:49.845 --> 23:50.721
You're just going to dig up the
whole landfill, or something'?

23:51.013 --> 23:52.390
No, we can't.

23:52.681 --> 23:53.807
The environment department
will not allow that to happen.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.396
You're saying that
there's a possibility

23:55.684 --> 23:57.652
that this could turn out to
be a giant waste of time.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.405
I think I've said it
before, I'll bet the car,

23:59.688 --> 24:00.534
I won't bet the house.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.865
Most everybody, at least
in the Western world,

24:10.157 --> 24:11.124
has played a video
game of some kind.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.279
They've gone to an arcade.

24:12.368 --> 24:13.264
They know the Atari brand.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.578
They certainly know E.T..

24:14.870 --> 24:17.498
And so I think there's
a universal curiosity

24:17.790 --> 24:19.258
about this game.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.090
You know, something did happen
those couple of nights in 1983

24:22.378 --> 24:26.428
that I think it merits
serious investigation.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.388
So why did I
decide to go to Alamogordo?

24:28.676 --> 24:30.804
I'm very much
interested in the impact

24:31.095 --> 24:32.642
that a particular
game or an industry

24:32.930 --> 24:35.900
has made within a cultural
and social context.

24:36.183 --> 24:38.606
What's striking about
the Atari E.T. game

24:38.894 --> 24:40.942
in the Alamogordo
landfill is that they're

24:41.230 --> 24:42.607
there and not in museums.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.616
I think this is what
excites many people

24:44.900 --> 24:48.120
who keep this narrative alive
is they want to get these items.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.451
They want visible proof.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.206
They want some kind
of tangible evidence

24:51.490 --> 24:54.494
that that dump did take place.

24:54.785 --> 24:55.661
I've
been professionally

24:55.953 --> 24:57.876
making games since about '94.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.915
But more than that,
I'm somebody who

25:00.207 --> 25:02.335
has been chiefly doing
a lot of historical work

25:02.626 --> 25:03.627
with video games.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.296
Trying to preserve
video games, and get

25:05.587 --> 25:07.055
people to understand that
video games are more like art.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.465
And so I've been doing
a lot of video game

25:08.757 --> 25:10.475
preservation and education.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.636
I always thought, one day,
I'm going to get over there,

25:12.928 --> 25:14.555
I'm going to see,
finally, once and for all,

25:14.847 --> 25:16.144
like, where it's buried.

25:16.432 --> 25:17.684
I almost don't even really
need to know what's in it.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.648
I almost want to keep
that mystery alive.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.609
To me, under that landfill
is actually the burial

25:22.896 --> 25:24.398
site of an entire industry.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.910
Because what affected Atari at
the time, affected everyone.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.321
And everything that I thought
was going to go on forever

25:30.612 --> 25:31.704
stopped.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.081
And it stopped almost
at that same moment

25:33.365 --> 25:35.333
that these... whatever's
there... was buried.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.589
So, for me, I want to
find out what is there.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.716
It's like opening the
Ark of the Covenant.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.047
It's like, you kind
of want to look,

25:44.334 --> 25:45.335
but is my face
going to melt off?

25:45.627 --> 25:46.970
I don't know.

25:47.254 --> 25:50.349
I have told my wife that I
will be going to New Mexico.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.884
And she asked me why.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.428
And I started to
explain, and she said,

25:53.719 --> 25:56.097
I don't... I don't need to know.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.891
Just go do it.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.355
You want
it Ernest on screen?

26:00.642 --> 26:01.493
Oh, whatever.

26:01.685 --> 26:02.607
Ernest is my fancy writer name.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.192
Ernie is what
everybody calls me.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.331
All right, so
we'll use your writer's name.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.616
How would you describe yourself?

26:07.900 --> 26:11.279
Screenwriter, novelist,
gentleman adventurer.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.369
The thing about having an Atari,
for me, was it was a simulator.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.283
Like, I could simulate
being Indiana Jones,

26:16.575 --> 26:19.044
or simulate being ET.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.454
Having access to that.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.293
And coming from a family
of, like, modest means,

26:22.581 --> 26:24.049
and not having to, you
know, beg for quarters.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.710
And just being able to
play as much as you wanted.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.594
That was such a huge
part of my childhood,

26:27.878 --> 26:29.300
and fed my imagination.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.842
And that was the inspiration
for Ready Player One, my novel.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.306
The idea of, like,
what if Willy Wonka

26:35.594 --> 26:37.016
had been a video game designer?

26:37.304 --> 26:39.523
And he held his golden ticket
contest inside his greatest

26:39.807 --> 26:40.808
video game creation?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.568
That all came from
finding those Easter

26:42.851 --> 26:44.319
eggs in all those Atari games.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.946
I feel like a little
kid, this past week.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.152
Like, getting ready
to go to camp.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.157
Alamogordo, and the
Atari graveyard.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.488
For me, it's like holy ground.

26:50.776 --> 26:51.672
And that was when I
realized my DeLorean

26:51.860 --> 26:53.328
is already in New Mexico.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.489
I just have to fly to Santa Fe,
pick up my DeLorean from George

26:55.781 --> 26:57.203
R. R. Martin... who was
using it for the Back

26:57.491 --> 26:59.744
to the Future screening... and
drive it down to Alamogordo.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.332
I could stop at the
very large array,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.748
and also hit Roswell, and
then go to Alamogordo,

27:04.039 --> 27:05.916
and be there for the excavation
of the Atari graveyard.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.552
As soon as those, you know,
tumblers clicked into place,

27:08.836 --> 27:10.509
I'm like, the most epic
road trip of all time.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.173
I have to go.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.013
It's like I'm Indy going to
Westeros to meet Doc Brown,

27:15.300 --> 27:16.142
and then save ET.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.987
Boom.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.371
Have a great drive, and a
great time in Alamogordo.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.530
George, thank you so much.

27:37.531 --> 27:38.364
I appreciate it man.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.709
My pleasure.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.147
This is
a good piece of evidence,

28:06.435 --> 28:08.403
because right here.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.734
Is that the
date, right there?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.239
Yeah, a date.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.196
You've got Sunday, October
2, 1983, right there.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.354
That's good, right?

28:14.443 --> 28:15.660
Yeah.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.537
Atari was from the 23rd
to the 29th of September.

28:17.821 --> 28:18.913
So this is like a week later.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.074
Well, it's not even a week.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.241
It's like two or
three days later.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.955
Well, I'm not
very good at math.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.244
The Ataris
would have been on the bottom,

28:24.536 --> 28:25.412
then garbage from
the following weeks

28:25.704 --> 28:26.580
would've been piled on top.

28:26.872 --> 28:27.747
So where are the games?

28:27.748 --> 28:28.670
This is following week.

28:28.957 --> 28:29.832
No games yet.

28:29.833 --> 28:30.650
No Atari stuff at all?

28:30.834 --> 28:31.626
No, not yet.

28:31.627 --> 28:32.453
Not yet.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.419
OK.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.246
I love the challenges.

28:34.338 --> 28:35.590
I love the mystery.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.725
I love the... especially when
people say they'll never

28:39.009 --> 28:41.262
be found, or they're not there.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.100
That just makes the
challenge even better.

28:43.388 --> 28:48.110
I put three to four years
of this research, planning,

28:48.393 --> 28:50.646
the politics, the
environment department.

28:50.938 --> 28:53.908
I mean, many, many, many
things to get to this point.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.192
Yeah, no.

28:55.484 --> 28:56.406
It's very important
that we find them.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.496
So,
back in the early '80s,

29:03.784 --> 29:06.207
movie licenses for
video games were just

29:06.495 --> 29:07.872
starting to come into vogue.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.415
And I think Raiders
was the first one.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.215
So they needed someone to
do Raiders of the Lost Ark.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.006
I think what happened was,
Yar's was very successful,

29:17.297 --> 29:20.972
and so they wanted
me to do a big game.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.637
And then it was up to Spielberg.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.145
So when I went down
and met with Spielberg,

29:24.429 --> 29:25.601
and if Spielberg would
have said, you know,

29:25.889 --> 29:26.765
I don't think he's really
right for the game,

29:27.057 --> 29:28.479
they would have
sent someone else.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.738
Can Indiana Jones
escape from the forces of evil?

29:33.021 --> 29:35.991
In Atari's Raiders of the
Lost Ark adventure game.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.572
What was the
reception to the Raiders

29:37.859 --> 29:39.076
of the Lost Ark game?

29:39.361 --> 29:40.283
It was another million seller.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.787
Raiders was huge.

29:42.072 --> 29:43.745
I mean, I can honestly say
I'm the only programmer

29:44.032 --> 29:45.625
in the history of Atari
where every one of my games

29:45.909 --> 29:47.911
that was released
was a million seller.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.830
The word meteoric comes to mind.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.715
And now,
Steven Spielberg brings

29:56.003 --> 29:58.756
us E.T. the Extra Terrestrial.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.475
Spielberg says, well, you know,
my pictures, they open slow.

30:05.762 --> 30:09.062
And they build, and they
hold, and da da da da da.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.602
And I just looked at him,
and I didn't know anything.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.065
I said, not this one.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.821
It was E.T..

30:15.105 --> 30:15.947
I said, it's going to open huge
, and it's going to stay huge.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.034
OK, the movie comes out.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.744
It's a huge hit.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.454
And we want to do
the cartridge of it.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.164
OK?

30:28.452 --> 30:30.705
You know, every time you try
to take some kind of a property

30:30.996 --> 30:33.670
and move it into another medium
for a pure profit motive,

30:33.957 --> 30:35.379
you get trouble.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.840
Specifically, with respect to
games, you know, it's like,

30:38.128 --> 30:39.300
oh you know, like,
let's go see if we can

30:39.588 --> 30:40.635
exploit this movie as a game.

30:40.922 --> 30:41.889
You know, maybe we
could make extra money

30:42.174 --> 30:43.551
out of a profitable franchise.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.392
Now, there was a negotiation
going on between the Atari

30:47.679 --> 30:49.397
people, and the
people at Universal,

30:49.681 --> 30:50.933
about what we're going to pay.

30:51.224 --> 30:54.353
And Steve Ross, who was the
CEO from Warner, got in,

30:54.644 --> 30:57.318
and for whatever the reasons, he
agrees to a deal that is so off

30:57.606 --> 30:58.949
the chart nobody believes it.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.529
But he does it.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.945
<i>N was $20 to $30 million,
it was some crazy number.</i>

31:03.236 --> 31:06.456
Steve Ross basically was trying
to woo Steven Spielberg to come

31:06.740 --> 31:08.287
to work for Warner,
because he recognized

31:08.575 --> 31:11.499
that Spielberg was a genius.

31:11.787 --> 31:15.041
And that all plays
into this story.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.801
Well, we acquired
the rights to E.T.,

31:18.085 --> 31:21.259
and it was... we had to have
the game out for Christmas.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.014
And that's a problem.

31:23.298 --> 31:28.976
One afternoon, I'm sitting in
my office, and a call comes in.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.855
And It's Ray Kassar.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.482
And he's calling from Monterey.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.643
So I take the call, and Ray
Kassar comes on the phone,

31:34.935 --> 31:36.152
and he says,

31:36.436 --> 31:39.815
Howard, can
you do E.T. in five weeks?

31:40.107 --> 31:42.701
And I said, yes I can.

31:42.984 --> 31:43.818
And he goes...

31:43.819 --> 31:45.287
OK.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.413
In two days, I want you to be
at San Jose Executive Airport.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.324
There'll be a Learjet
waiting for you.

31:49.616 --> 31:50.708
Be on that jet.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.790
Be ready to propose
the game to Spielberg.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.920
During that meeting, when I
flew down on a Learjet to go

31:58.208 --> 32:01.428
meet Spielberg and
present the game to him.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.803
Even though I only
had five weeks,

32:03.088 --> 32:04.180
I still wanted to innovate.

32:04.464 --> 32:07.263
So I proposed a 3D
world that the game

32:07.551 --> 32:08.677
was going to take place on.

32:08.969 --> 32:13.349
And the huge scope what
I was trying to achieve,

32:13.640 --> 32:16.985
it walks that line between
really trying to make something

32:17.269 --> 32:19.146
happen and venturing
into the impossible,

32:19.438 --> 32:20.906
and walking off a cliff.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.441
The emotionality of
the game was supposed

32:22.732 --> 32:23.574
to come out through
the interaction

32:23.859 --> 32:25.236
with the characters.

32:25.527 --> 32:28.781
You have the FBI agent who's
interested in what you have.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.870
That's why the FBI
agent just steals

32:31.158 --> 32:32.501
stuff that you were holding.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.253
You have the scientist who's
interested in who you are.

32:35.537 --> 32:39.087
The scientist actually
carries you back to the city,

32:39.374 --> 32:40.466
because they want to study you.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.127
And Elliott comes
in to save you.

32:42.419 --> 32:43.671
There's times when
you can call Elliott,

32:43.962 --> 32:44.963
and he will help you out.

32:45.255 --> 32:46.427
And so, those are
the kind of things

32:46.715 --> 32:48.558
that I had that I thought
created, possibly,

32:48.842 --> 32:50.264
some sentiment.

32:50.552 --> 32:54.352
And at one point, Spielberg
says to me, he goes, you know,

32:54.639 --> 32:58.064
couldn't you do something
more like Pas-Man'?

32:58.351 --> 33:00.024
No, Steven, we need to
do a game that's fresh.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.031
We need to do something that's
really worthy of this movie.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.817
It's not how simple you can
make a complicated game.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.610
It's how complicated
a game can you

33:06.902 --> 33:10.532
make subject to the constraint
of easy learnability.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.199
My job is to produce
a cartridge that

33:12.491 --> 33:15.370
is going to sell for Atari.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.085
A typical VCS game at the
time took five or six months.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.965
And this is going
to be in five weeks.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.298
You might think, no, nobody
can do a game in five weeks.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.964
Like most people in the
department would think.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.106
But I don't think that way.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.642
I think, yeah, I can do that.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.473
The word hubris comes to mind.

33:32.761 --> 33:34.559
I mean, whatever it is I
might have been full of,

33:34.846 --> 33:37.144
I was overflowing
with it at that point.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.230
Because if the game can't
make the Christmas market,

33:39.518 --> 33:40.770
the game is a total waste.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.688
They're going miss their window.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.071
So that was the big thing.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.735
It was the $22 million
bet that you could turn

33:48.026 --> 33:49.243
the game around in that time.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.122
I had a development
station moved into my home,

33:52.405 --> 33:56.785
so I could be basically working
on this game almost 24 hours.

33:57.077 --> 34:00.297
We found that there was a
good probability of success.

34:00.580 --> 34:05.882
We took a coin operated game and
just ported it over to a game

34:06.169 --> 34:07.261
that we could play on the VCS.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.092
E.T. didn't have that.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.260
Hello?

34:14.261 --> 34:15.308
Is somebody out there?

34:21.518 --> 34:24.772
E.T. video game?

34:25.063 --> 34:26.315
Wow.

34:26.606 --> 34:27.697
It's
the video game that

34:27.983 --> 34:28.800
lets you pretend you're E.T.

34:28.984 --> 34:29.775
OK.

34:29.775 --> 34:30.743
So the game's done.

34:31.027 --> 34:31.949
And one of the
conditions I asked for

34:32.237 --> 34:33.489
was that Steven
Spielberg is the one

34:33.780 --> 34:34.871
who approves the final game.

34:35.156 --> 34:36.748
So Steven Spielberg
played the final game

34:37.033 --> 34:39.161
and approved it for release.

34:39.452 --> 34:44.458
Howard, who is a
certifiable genius,

34:44.748 --> 34:47.672
went off and, about,
a number of weeks

34:47.960 --> 34:51.761
later came back with a
concept and a game plan.

34:52.047 --> 34:55.052
I was amazed at how difficult
it was, yet at the same time

34:55.342 --> 34:57.641
how much fun it was to play.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.602
I've seen the final game.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.311
Oh yeah, yeah, it's my favorite.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.352
Of course I'm biased,
I made the movie.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.236
Steven
Spielberg thought it was OK,

35:05.520 --> 35:08.148
so I thought, all right,
I'm good with that.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.819
And... not that I'm
blaming him, for anything.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.032
No, of course not.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.191
But...

35:14.279 --> 35:15.150
But it's his fault.

35:17.240 --> 35:21.461
The video game that
lets you help E.T. get home

35:21.745 --> 35:24.544
just in time for Christmas.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.083
After E.T. was released,

35:26.374 --> 35:27.341
there was a great
sense of relief

35:27.626 --> 35:28.752
that we'd actually
made the schedule.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.512
And everything was good.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.422
And then the game
went out into market,

35:32.714 --> 35:34.216
and it was very high
on the billboard list.

35:34.507 --> 35:35.975
And again, things were good.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.227
I got E.T., I think
it was Christmas of 1982,

35:38.511 --> 35:39.407
if I remember correctly.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.314
And I thought it
was like... I was

35:41.598 --> 35:44.067
to be the guy on the street who
had E.T. before everybody else.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.819
Turns out everybody I knew
got E.T. that Christmas.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.228
After a while,

35:47.520 --> 35:48.897
people start going by
me in the halls... people

35:49.189 --> 35:51.783
from other buildings, people
from marketing, and management.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.741
And they're saying things like,
you know, you know something,

35:55.028 --> 35:56.621
Howard, you did a great job.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.327
We don't blame you.

35:58.615 --> 35:59.787
That was really
something, what you did.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.577
You really came
through for us there,

36:01.868 --> 36:04.621
and we don't want you to
think we think anything else.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.039
This really isn't about you.

36:06.331 --> 36:07.298
Don't feel bad.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.004
It's OK, it's cool.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.339
And I'm thinking, like, what
the hell are they talking about?

36:10.627 --> 36:12.971
E.T. was a really hard game.

36:13.254 --> 36:17.259
It was the kind of game
that was brutal, unfair,

36:17.550 --> 36:18.517
it didn't make a lot of sense.

36:18.802 --> 36:19.928
I
grew up in London,

36:20.220 --> 36:22.439
and there was a video
game store in my town

36:22.722 --> 36:25.475
that let you rent... I don't know
what the rental was, like 50

36:25.767 --> 36:27.440
pence for a weekend...
and I still remember

36:27.727 --> 36:28.649
feeling like I wasted my money.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.029
Because it just... it was bad.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.439
People aren't liking it.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.075
And people aren't
liking it a lot.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.533
And what made it particularly
bad was my memory of the movie

36:37.821 --> 36:38.654
was SO great.

36:38.655 --> 36:39.702
I loved the movie.

36:39.989 --> 36:40.864
Everyone loved the
movie when it came out.

36:40.865 --> 36:41.787
It's a great movie.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.372
Still is it is a
classic movie today.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.004
And so this massive
chasm that existed

36:46.287 --> 36:49.040
between the quality of the movie
and the quality of the game

36:49.332 --> 36:51.755
that was based on, I think just
made it seem that much more

36:52.043 --> 36:53.090
like a slap in the face.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.925
OK, well, maybe it
won't sell six million.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.556
Maybe it will only
sell four million.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.433
Or three million,
that would be OK.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.185
And then there's, like, returns.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.811
People are returning the game.

37:02.095 --> 37:03.096
They made too many.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.514
How many they made,
I don't even know.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.854
They made, like, four
million cartridges.

37:07.142 --> 37:09.736
That means there could be
millions of carts coming back.

37:10.019 --> 37:14.946
So what do you do with
useless, worthless product'?

37:15.233 --> 37:16.155
How do you get rid of it?

37:16.443 --> 37:17.314
Bury it.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.219
That's a pretty good answer.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.073
Well, career change

37:22.365 --> 37:23.617
is not anything new for me.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.411
I've been through a number
of different careers.

37:26.703 --> 37:30.298
I actually went and got
a California real estate

37:30.582 --> 37:32.129
license, and then
a broker's license,

37:32.417 --> 37:33.464
and did that for a while.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.174
And I did that just
long enough to know

37:35.462 --> 37:37.931
this was, like, the last thing
in the world I wanted to do.

37:38.214 --> 37:41.434
And now I am a licensed,
practicing psychotherapist

37:41.718 --> 37:43.095
in California.

37:43.386 --> 37:45.229
And I'm a very unique therapist,
in that I have a Master's

37:45.513 --> 37:47.891
of Engineering and I also
have a Master of Arts

37:48.183 --> 37:49.605
in counseling psychology.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.486
I mean, I'm the Silicon
Valley therapist.

37:51.770 --> 37:56.025
I'm very good at translating
between English and nerd.

37:56.316 --> 38:00.571
And this is the first time since
I left Atari that I feel I'm

38:00.862 --> 38:03.081
doing what I really love doing.

38:03.364 --> 38:07.995
So it took me 30 years
to get back to a place

38:08.286 --> 38:12.166
that I don't feel I'm a step
down from where I used to work.

38:12.457 --> 38:15.836
And that's many,
many different jobs.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.425
I know this dig is coming up,
and I'm going to be there.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.841
I'm going to be
standing right there.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.477
And I am going to literally
watch my past being dug up.

38:24.761 --> 38:28.231
And that's a weird kind
of thing to anticipate.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.517
My hopes are in one way, and
my expectations are another.

38:30.809 --> 38:31.935
And I don't know what
it's going to be.

38:32.227 --> 38:33.570
I really don't know
what it's going to be.

38:33.853 --> 38:37.483
I don't know what it's
going to mean to me when,

38:37.774 --> 38:39.196
if something comes
up, if it's there.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.278
Part of punk archeology
is that sense of community.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.538
And the fact that we're
helping each other out

39:25.822 --> 39:27.449
to address the issues
that we're interested in.

39:27.740 --> 39:30.664
And most of the time we're
doing it on a volunteer basis.

39:30.952 --> 39:33.796
It's going to be interesting to
see how they decide to excavate

39:34.080 --> 39:35.957
in order to clear a
better area, you know,

39:36.249 --> 39:38.968
so that we can get at more
of the content that we need.

39:39.252 --> 39:40.925
One of the people down
there did confirm finding

39:41.212 --> 39:42.134
a Donny and Marie poster.

39:42.422 --> 39:43.844
Yeah, yeah, which is awesome.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.133
Well, basically,
because we're going

39:45.425 --> 39:46.597
to treat this as a
salvage excavation,

39:46.885 --> 39:48.182
we will dig a trench.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.813
We'll go through and excavate
the material in the pits

39:51.097 --> 39:52.314
that we dig.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.521
At which point, we'll send
them up to the tables.

39:53.808 --> 39:54.775
We'll sort through the material.

39:55.059 --> 39:55.893
We'll weigh it.

39:55.894 --> 39:56.768
We'll count it.

39:56.769 --> 39:57.586
Identify it.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.819
And, yeah, that's the plan.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.484
What's
happened so far today?

40:02.775 --> 40:04.573
Basically, we started
digging in the hole,

40:04.861 --> 40:05.737
and the trucks have
already started

40:06.029 --> 40:07.451
going through the train.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.582
So, just so people understand...
and probably, right now I'm

40:09.866 --> 40:13.461
cutting to an awesome
diagram of this.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.588
There's, like, 20
feet of garbage

40:15.872 --> 40:17.795
that's on the top of wherever
the games are buried.

40:18.082 --> 40:18.924
Garbage and dirt.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.835
Sorry,
garbage and dirt.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.095
In the diagram it's
going to be pretty clear.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.473
And so, that all has
to be taken away.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.259
Yeah,
we'll get the vast majority

40:27.550 --> 40:28.676
of the hole excavated out.

40:28.968 --> 40:29.844
And so far,
have we found anything?

40:30.136 --> 40:31.103
Found any Atari games?

40:31.387 --> 40:32.179
No, nothing.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.055
Nothing.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.103
Nothing yet.

40:34.390 --> 40:37.018
And Son, I mean, you
seem pretty nervous.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.181
Right.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.102
Are you?

40:39.103 --> 40:39.895
Oh yeah, terrified.

40:39.896 --> 40:40.687
Terrified.

40:40.688 --> 40:41.905
OK.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.658
I gotta be honest,
I'm nervous as shit.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.786
I don't know if that'll help
motivate you guys, but...

40:47.070 --> 40:48.743
Yeah, that did it for us.

40:49.030 --> 40:49.901
We need to get back to work.

40:49.989 --> 40:50.614
Yeah.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.239
Great.

40:51.240 --> 40:51.865
Let's go.

40:51.866 --> 40:52.574
Go team.

40:52.575 --> 40:53.367
Way to go.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.264
Son, calm down, buddy.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.381
People say nerd or geek.

41:02.669 --> 41:03.886
I say enthusiast.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.922
I love things, and I love
people who love things.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.343
But if you spend all your time
focusing on all the amazing,

41:09.634 --> 41:11.261
like, art and entertainment
that's being made,

41:11.552 --> 41:12.644
there's so much of
it happening now,

41:12.929 --> 41:16.934
you can't even take it all in.

41:17.225 --> 41:18.647
And it's like the dig.

41:18.935 --> 41:20.357
When I tell people, like, the
right kind people about it,

41:20.645 --> 41:22.898
they're like, I can't believe
that it's finally happening.

41:23.189 --> 41:24.941
And that you're going
to get to be there.

41:25.233 --> 41:26.450
You know, I get,
look, goosebumps.

41:26.734 --> 41:27.951
Goosebumps talking about it.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.149
My local video game shop
in Austin, Texas, Game

41:58.433 --> 42:00.356
Over Video Games, they gave
me every copy they have

42:00.643 --> 42:02.566
of every one of Howard's games.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.528
Little known fact... E.T. has the
very first official video game

42:05.815 --> 42:07.362
Easter egg ever in a video game.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.948
Warren Robinett had the
very first one in Adventure,

42:10.236 --> 42:11.488
but he did that without
anybody knowing.

42:11.779 --> 42:13.747
Howard asked if he could
put Easter eggs in the game,

42:14.032 --> 42:14.999
and Atari said yes.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.456
If you go find the
geranium, and you

42:17.744 --> 42:19.712
make the germanium
regenerate, it turns

42:19.996 --> 42:22.624
into Yar, from Yar's Revenge.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.383
And he flies away.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.510
The first time it happened to
me, when I was 11 years old,

42:26.794 --> 42:28.011
I shit myself.

42:28.296 --> 42:30.264
And then if you do it
again, it turns into Indy

42:30.548 --> 42:31.515
from Raiders of the Lost Ark.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.927
So Howard hid characters
from this game

42:34.218 --> 42:35.310
and this game in this game.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.074
Hello.

42:40.266 --> 42:41.142
Hi, good afternoon.

42:41.434 --> 42:42.251
Welcome to the Lodge.

42:42.435 --> 42:43.561
Well, it's nice to be here.

42:43.853 --> 42:44.854
Are you checking in?
- Absolutely.

42:45.146 --> 42:46.021
Great.

42:46.022 --> 42:46.864
Can I get the last name.

42:47.148 --> 42:47.981
Warshaw.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.610
W-A-R-S-H-A-W.

42:50.902 --> 42:51.693
Howard.

42:51.694 --> 42:52.511
That's me.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.015
So it's the day
of the actual dig.

43:13.299 --> 43:16.428
And my Wife and I are in a van,
on our way to the landfill.

43:16.719 --> 43:17.811
It was a strange feeling.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.894
I mean, I was, like, nervous.

43:20.181 --> 43:22.934
And I didn't really
understand why.

43:23.226 --> 43:26.526
But I just had this sense...
just like a tingly thing...

43:26.813 --> 43:29.612
that something is
going on here today.

43:29.899 --> 43:32.197
And as we pull
into the landfill,

43:32.485 --> 43:33.782
there were already people there.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.663
And there's more people.

43:35.947 --> 43:38.325
And we go on, and
there's more people.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.368
And it just keeps
going and going.

43:45.873 --> 43:48.217
I guess it sort of felt like
a religious pilgrimage to me.

43:48.501 --> 43:49.969
I called up some
friends, and said, hey,

43:50.253 --> 43:51.505
can we get down there?

43:51.796 --> 43:53.013
And I asked my brother-in-law
if he wanted to go.

43:53.297 --> 43:54.344
Heck, let's do it.
Let's check it out.

43:54.632 --> 43:55.508
And my wife said, whatever.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.237
It's one of those
weird monumental video

44:07.520 --> 44:09.989
game based events that only
comes around once a century.

44:10.273 --> 44:12.367
This is our generation's
urban legend.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.197
Billions of cartridges
out in the desert.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.078
Growing up, you always read
the little rumors about it.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.238
I grew up playing
an Atari, which

44:17.530 --> 44:18.577
my babysitters had given me.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.333
And I actually
had the E.T. game.

44:20.616 --> 44:21.833
My friend and I, she
and I would actually

44:22.118 --> 44:23.335
just for fun on
the weekends, drive

44:23.619 --> 44:24.791
around trying to
figure out where would

44:25.079 --> 44:26.205
these Atari games be buried.

44:26.497 --> 44:27.623
It's the fun of the legend.

44:27.915 --> 44:29.041
It's like looking for
the Loch Ness monster.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.505
What did you
think when you played

44:30.793 --> 44:32.545
the E.T. game last night?

44:32.837 --> 44:33.963
It was awesome.

44:34.255 --> 44:36.553
Because in my opinion,
I like terrible games.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.689
To come back and to
relive the feeling

44:47.977 --> 44:51.277
I got off those games is
something I couldn't pass up.

44:51.564 --> 44:52.907
I just Want to know
about the urban myth.

44:53.191 --> 44:55.159
See if it's really
buried out here.

44:55.443 --> 44:57.366
I just came out here to be
part of video game history.

44:57.653 --> 44:58.870
Had to see whether
it's true or not.

44:59.155 --> 45:01.249
You have to be a
special kind of nerd

45:01.532 --> 45:05.958
to be able to want to drive
28 hours for a video game.

45:09.498 --> 45:10.920
The myth
that E.T., the video game,

45:11.209 --> 45:13.712
for the Atari 2600 was the
worst video game all time,

45:14.003 --> 45:14.925
it would be so great
to debunk that,

45:15.213 --> 45:16.760
because it's just not true.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.425
But also to redeem
Howard Scott Warshaw,

45:18.716 --> 45:20.684
because he's an amazing
video game designer,

45:20.968 --> 45:21.864
and his game was great.

45:24.847 --> 45:26.099
Ha ha, cool car.

45:26.390 --> 45:27.286
Yeah, I like that.

45:27.475 --> 45:28.772
E.T.'s in there.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.312
This
morning, coming to a dump

45:30.603 --> 45:33.197
in a small town in New Mexico.

45:33.481 --> 45:36.075
There were people lined
up, waiting to get in.

45:36.359 --> 45:38.032
When's the last time
you saw line of people

45:38.319 --> 45:39.616
waiting to get into a dump?

45:39.904 --> 45:42.373
It totally took me by surprise,
but in a delightful way.

45:45.451 --> 45:48.375
You never go to a dump unless
you're throwing something away,

45:48.663 --> 45:51.883
and here We are, trying to find
treasure... buried treasure.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.258
I think they'll
find something.

45:53.542 --> 45:55.340
I mean, the cartridges
had to go somewhere.

45:55.628 --> 45:57.096
Why not here?

45:57.380 --> 45:59.508
It is a lot of
open space, great place

45:59.799 --> 46:01.472
to dump a million cartridges.

46:01.759 --> 46:05.980
There is a definite
possibility that there is games.

46:06.264 --> 46:09.313
This is archeology
for the time I grew up.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.602
So nostalgia for anything
that came out of that era

46:11.894 --> 46:12.695
is pretty high.

46:20.903 --> 46:23.076
All right, now the wind is
really picking up, on cue.

46:23.364 --> 46:24.616
On cue.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.033
The weather
here, in Alamogordo

46:26.325 --> 46:30.375
is awesome if you
like sandstorms

46:30.663 --> 46:34.543
and an impending doom
filled cloud of white.

46:34.834 --> 46:35.680
Woah.

46:40.047 --> 46:41.094
Aw, this is getting brutal.

46:41.382 --> 46:42.257
Yeah.

46:42.258 --> 46:44.181
Sorry, this is brutal.

46:44.468 --> 46:45.640
Getting very windy.

46:45.928 --> 46:47.521
Basically, what's
happening is the white sands

46:47.805 --> 46:51.150
are blowing in from White
Sands, and covering everything.

46:51.434 --> 46:52.686
And it's really shitty.

46:52.977 --> 46:54.229
They're saying this is
like a historic wind today.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.371
Really?

46:55.563 --> 46:56.735
That's what somebody told us.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.070
To think that we're

46:58.357 --> 46:59.174
in the middle of a Sandstorm.

46:59.358 --> 47:00.233
Really?

47:00.234 --> 47:01.360
This is what's going on?

47:01.652 --> 47:02.778
And for me it was almost
like the big sand storm

47:03.070 --> 47:04.492
right at the opening
of Close Encounters,

47:04.780 --> 47:06.828
you know, the people wearing
the goggles and the bandannas.

47:07.116 --> 47:09.210
Everybody's like, gather around,
because they found something.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.245
And they can't believe
what they've found.

47:11.537 --> 47:13.539
Are we the first?

47:13.831 --> 47:15.504
This is Tony
Johnson, from Denver,

47:15.791 --> 47:17.714
Colorado, who ran up
to me in my DeLorean.

47:18.002 --> 47:18.819
He's like, I found something.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.050
I found something.

47:20.338 --> 47:22.090
And Tony is going to
go down in history,

47:22.381 --> 47:24.349
because he found the first
evidence of Atari hardware.

47:24.633 --> 47:25.504
Whoa.

47:25.593 --> 47:26.469
Whoa, that's pretty huge.

47:26.761 --> 47:27.978
Right there it is, my man.

47:28.262 --> 47:31.482
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
we have an announcement.

47:31.766 --> 47:34.861
So, Tony, tell us
what you just found.

47:35.144 --> 47:38.068
An Atari 2600 joystick toggle.

47:41.233 --> 47:42.826
So, Tony, where
did you find it?

47:43.110 --> 47:46.159
Walking to the bathroom.

47:46.447 --> 47:48.120
So it was a surface find?

47:48.407 --> 47:49.624
Surface find.

47:49.909 --> 47:51.161
Yeah, like we know what
a surface find is, right?

47:51.452 --> 47:53.079
Well, a surface find
is something... you know,

47:53.371 --> 47:54.623
you're walking around, you're
looking down on the ground,

47:54.914 --> 47:56.006
you see something interesting
and you pick it up.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.463
It's totally out of
archaeological context.

47:58.751 --> 48:00.674
What are the odds that that,
like, blew out of the hole?

48:00.961 --> 48:02.338
Actually, I think
they're pretty good.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.507
I mean, the wind is blowing
fiercely in that direction.

48:04.799 --> 48:06.176
You know, the stuff's
coming out of the bucket.

48:06.467 --> 48:07.935
You know, we've been finding
a lot of interesting things

48:08.219 --> 48:09.186
that date from around that time.

48:09.470 --> 48:10.341
Anything from Atari?

48:10.429 --> 48:11.806
Uh, nothing from Atari yet.

48:12.098 --> 48:13.520
How can you authenticate this?

48:13.808 --> 48:15.856
Can you carbon date it?

48:16.143 --> 48:17.941
No, it's much too
recent for that.

48:23.067 --> 48:25.570
There are really two things
that we could be dealing with,

48:25.861 --> 48:27.488
when taking a look
at these cartridges,

48:27.780 --> 48:28.702
if they're actually there.

48:28.989 --> 48:30.616
First thing is that
they just loaded

48:30.908 --> 48:32.751
the trucks are these cartridges,
and then they dumped them.

48:33.035 --> 48:34.332
And that's the best
possible scenario,

48:34.620 --> 48:36.042
because you could pull
them out, and I bet you

48:36.330 --> 48:37.297
most of them would be playable.

48:37.581 --> 48:38.707
You know, they've
just been in there

48:38.999 --> 48:44.052
for... you know, since 1983.

48:45.339 --> 48:46.636
We're right about
where we need to be,

48:46.924 --> 48:50.303
but there's still no
Atari detritus at all.

48:50.594 --> 48:52.312
We've been here for
a while, all ready.

48:52.596 --> 48:53.388
It's tedious.

48:53.389 --> 48:54.766
The Wind's horrible.

48:55.057 --> 48:56.559
We're wondering if they're
going to find anything or not.

49:01.605 --> 49:02.982
I don't think there's
anything in that hole

49:03.274 --> 49:04.571
except rattlesnakes scorpions.

49:04.859 --> 49:06.611
If it's buried, it's
probably for a reason.

49:06.902 --> 49:07.703
It should stay buried.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.248
I wasn't thinking that
something was really

49:15.536 --> 49:18.836
messed up until late '83.

49:19.123 --> 49:20.716
To me, Atari was
never going to go away.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.422
It was this thing that
was just part of my life.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.178
And the thought that
there could ever

49:24.462 --> 49:28.387
be a day where there was no
Atari... or no Atari 2600... I

49:28.674 --> 49:29.766
never crossed my mind.

49:30.050 --> 49:32.894
E.T. comes out, and
E.T. is not so great.

49:33.179 --> 49:36.729
And somewhere toward
the end of the year

49:37.016 --> 49:39.895
I'm starting to wonder,
are we making our numbers?

49:40.186 --> 49:42.814
Which leads to one of the
worst nights of my life.

49:43.105 --> 49:47.986
On December 7, 1982 I get a
call from Dennis Groth, who

49:48.277 --> 49:50.530
was the CFO of Atari, he says,

49:50.821 --> 49:53.290
Manny,
here's the new budget.

49:53.574 --> 49:56.498
And it's a huge shortfall
from what we have been told.

49:56.785 --> 49:58.128
Warner Communications
said today

49:58.412 --> 50:01.666
that its once booming Atari
business lost another $180

50:01.957 --> 50:04.585
million in the third
quarter, for total losses

50:04.877 --> 50:07.096
this year of more than
half a billion dollars.

50:07.379 --> 50:10.007
I was starting to see
enough signs in the company

50:10.299 --> 50:12.176
that things were
starting to unravel.

50:12.468 --> 50:14.470
It was unraveling
is hard and fast.

50:14.762 --> 50:16.764
And we didn't have
any ready solutions.

50:17.056 --> 50:19.935
Several Atari executives,
including Atari's chairman,

50:20.226 --> 50:22.854
Raymond Kassar, sold
Warner stock shortly

50:23.145 --> 50:24.772
before the negative
earnings announcement,

50:25.064 --> 50:27.192
and the decline in the
price of the stock.

50:27.483 --> 50:30.157
Kassar denies any
wrongdoing or impropriety,

50:30.444 --> 50:33.072
but a number of stockholders
have sued Warner.

50:33.364 --> 50:34.832
So
they got rid of Ray Kassar,

50:35.115 --> 50:37.368
and they brought in a
guy from Phillip Morris.

50:37.660 --> 50:43.087
And when he came in, Atari
had 10,000 employees.

50:43.374 --> 50:46.218
And within about four
months, or five months,

50:46.502 --> 50:48.550
Atari had 2000 employees.

50:48.837 --> 50:54.765
I really got that we had
lost 80% of our staff.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.180
In the short run, the market
is frequently irrational.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.690
In the longer run,
hopefully it's rational.

50:59.974 --> 51:02.227
The wild upside ride was over.

51:02.518 --> 51:07.365
Did not understand the extent
of the downside ride was coming.

51:07.648 --> 51:09.571
This is slipping away.

51:09.858 --> 51:11.986
The train is derailing.

51:12.278 --> 51:16.829
It's not going to keep riding,
and what am I going to do next?

51:17.116 --> 51:19.414
It was a big emotional blow.

51:19.702 --> 51:24.458
It was my baby, and I
hated to see it abused.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.045
New Media magazine

51:26.333 --> 51:31.760
credited E.T. with destroying
the video game industry.

51:32.047 --> 51:33.299
That's interesting.

51:33.591 --> 51:34.683
I think that's really
interesting that I could be

51:34.967 --> 51:36.810
single handedly
responsible for toppling

51:37.094 --> 51:38.721
a billion dollar industry.

51:39.013 --> 51:39.804
E.T. comes out.

51:39.805 --> 51:40.727
The industry dies.

51:41.015 --> 51:42.062
Howard's associated
with that, and I

51:42.349 --> 51:44.022
think that's
affected his career,

51:44.310 --> 51:45.562
and what people will
remember him for.

51:45.853 --> 51:47.776
And that's... that's pretty bad.

51:48.063 --> 51:50.816
The fact that a
guy's career got

51:51.108 --> 51:53.452
destroyed because
he did E.T., given

51:53.736 --> 51:56.330
the circumstances
surrounding doing E.T.,

51:56.614 --> 51:58.241
it's completely unfair.

51:58.532 --> 51:59.374
I mean, it's sad.

51:59.658 --> 52:00.784
It's really sad.

52:01.076 --> 52:02.453
There's this
video game walk of fame.

52:02.745 --> 52:04.167
There's also this show called
DICE, where they give out

52:04.455 --> 52:05.351
lifetime achievement awards.

52:05.539 --> 52:06.381
Howard's not in that.

52:06.665 --> 52:08.008
He's not put in that same group.

52:08.292 --> 52:09.635
They kind of keep him
out of all these things,

52:09.918 --> 52:10.760
and it's kind of a shame.

52:13.464 --> 52:15.137
The day I left Atari.

52:15.424 --> 52:17.597
When things had really fallen
apart, and it was over.

52:17.885 --> 52:20.980
And I'm literally carrying
my garbage out to my car

52:21.263 --> 52:24.187
to leave for the last time.

52:24.475 --> 52:28.196
That was a very
depressing moment for me.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.447
Because I felt I
was losing the most

52:30.731 --> 52:33.075
important thing in my life.

52:33.359 --> 52:37.956
And I also knew it
was so unreal that I'd

52:38.238 --> 52:39.831
never be able to recreate it.

52:40.115 --> 52:44.416
The burial in Alamogordo is
basically Atari's funeral.

52:44.703 --> 52:48.378
The burial of those cartridges
represents the burial

52:48.666 --> 52:52.261
of that beautiful era.

52:52.544 --> 52:54.262
And that may be what's
interesting about it.

52:54.546 --> 52:56.139
I don't know, I mean,
that's a whole psychology

52:56.423 --> 52:57.766
I'm not going to go near.

52:58.050 --> 53:00.178
But it may be because it is
about the death of Atari.

53:00.469 --> 53:01.361
That's what it is.

53:05.015 --> 53:07.643
We can't control
how the past returns to us.

53:07.935 --> 53:10.029
We may get something
that no longer

53:10.312 --> 53:11.609
resembles an E.T. cartridge.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.865
We may get something
monstrous, something twisted,

53:14.149 --> 53:15.150
something decayed.

53:15.442 --> 53:16.284
We may not even know
what we're looking

53:16.568 --> 53:19.822
at if we unearth Atari's E.T..

53:20.114 --> 53:22.367
Part of me feels
that when you finally crack open

53:22.658 --> 53:24.001
this place, and
you start to look,

53:24.284 --> 53:25.752
it's going to be a lot like
the Ark of the Covenant.

53:26.036 --> 53:27.504
It's just going to
be a bunch of sand.

53:27.788 --> 53:31.588
But another part of
me hopes that what's

53:31.875 --> 53:33.001
found there is going
to lead to a lot more

53:33.293 --> 53:35.637
understanding, and
a lot more discovery

53:35.921 --> 53:37.889
about what really happened.

53:46.181 --> 53:47.683
What's his name?

53:47.975 --> 53:48.766
Joe.

53:48.767 --> 53:50.861
Joe!

53:51.145 --> 53:52.362
They want me to come in?

53:52.646 --> 53:53.517
Let's go.

53:57.443 --> 53:59.070
So what's up?

53:59.361 --> 54:00.203
You guys find something?

54:04.241 --> 54:05.493
I should have
brought my binoculars.

54:09.079 --> 54:10.126
Could you show me?

54:20.924 --> 54:22.096
They're
bringing some stuff

54:22.384 --> 54:24.307
over to the archaeologists'
table right now.

54:24.595 --> 54:25.487
Let's see what's going on.

54:29.683 --> 54:30.500
Can everybody hear me?

54:34.438 --> 54:36.691
We found something.

54:36.982 --> 54:39.952
The archaeologists have
confirmed it's from 1983.

54:40.235 --> 54:42.329
28 feet down.

54:42.613 --> 54:43.785
It's E.T., the video game.

54:44.072 --> 54:45.745
Intact in its box.

54:51.580 --> 54:52.455
Wow.

54:52.456 --> 54:53.673
There you go, Son.

54:57.795 --> 54:59.593
It's an emotional,
emotional event.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.974
They've backed up
this legend with fact,

55:02.257 --> 55:04.259
and it's incredible
to be a part of it.

55:04.551 --> 55:07.555
Good job, Joe.

55:07.846 --> 55:09.644
I wasn't nervous until we
got down to that, where he was

55:09.932 --> 55:11.229
almost reaching his max length.

55:11.517 --> 55:13.770
But yeah, it was a big
weight off my shoulders

55:14.061 --> 55:18.612
when that bucket came
up and E.T. was there.

55:18.899 --> 55:19.770
Congratulations.

55:19.858 --> 55:21.075
Thank you.

55:21.360 --> 55:22.577
I didn't think they were
going to find them intact,

55:22.861 --> 55:24.204
I thought for sure they'd
be crushed and ruined.

55:24.488 --> 55:25.614
Now I've got
goosebumps, and it's

55:25.906 --> 55:27.032
not because of the dust storm.

55:27.324 --> 55:29.372
What's this moment
like for you?

55:29.660 --> 55:30.582
Look at all the
excitement that's

55:30.869 --> 55:33.543
been generated
today over something

55:33.831 --> 55:36.129
that I did 32 years ago.

55:36.416 --> 55:42.267
I just... it's immensely
personal thing.

55:44.550 --> 55:49.603
What it took to make
these games, was a lot.

55:50.889 --> 55:53.187
And this one was
done in five weeks.

55:53.475 --> 55:58.151
That was one of the hardest
five weeks of my life.

55:58.438 --> 56:02.443
So I need a little moment.

56:02.734 --> 56:04.281
I'm just so excited to be here.

56:13.453 --> 56:15.205
A lot of these people that
are complaining about E.T. had

56:15.497 --> 56:16.589
never actually even played it.

56:16.874 --> 56:18.171
And I ever since then,
I would talk to people,

56:18.458 --> 56:19.425
and we would talk about
E.T., and I'm like,

56:19.710 --> 56:20.757
well, have you ever
played the game?

56:21.044 --> 56:22.341
And it would come
out that they didn't.

56:22.629 --> 56:24.723
They would just kind of
continue this myth of the game

56:25.007 --> 56:25.798
being really horrible.

56:25.799 --> 56:26.891
Is a good game.

56:27.175 --> 56:28.893
It wasn't the worst
that Atari had to offer.

56:29.177 --> 56:31.145
There was, like... I remember
getting a game called Fire Fly.

56:33.974 --> 56:35.146
That is the worst
game for Atari.

56:35.434 --> 56:36.310
That's what every
should be focusing

56:36.602 --> 56:37.854
their efforts on, not E.T..

56:38.145 --> 56:39.738
Now let me be clear,
the worst game ever made

56:40.022 --> 56:40.839
was obviously Trespasser.

56:43.525 --> 56:45.027
So I just want to
be clear with that.

56:45.319 --> 56:47.196
With the shitload
of just horrible poorly made

56:47.487 --> 56:50.206
cranked out Atari
games, to call E.T.

56:50.490 --> 56:52.163
the worst one is just shameful.

56:52.451 --> 56:55.375
In contemporary game culture
we like trashing games.

56:55.662 --> 56:57.414
I don't mean putting
them in landfills,

56:57.706 --> 57:00.425
but verbally
trashing game design.

57:00.709 --> 57:04.179
It's become fashionable to sort
of regard E.T. as the worst

57:04.463 --> 57:05.760
video game of all time.

57:06.048 --> 57:08.346
In fact, it makes everybody's
list as the number one.

57:08.634 --> 57:09.977
And I'm going to go
out on a complete limb

57:10.260 --> 57:11.887
here, and say... maybe people
will attack me for this...

57:12.179 --> 57:15.183
but I'd rather play Atari's
E.T. than any Call of Duty.

57:15.474 --> 57:19.854
In context, given the time and
the situation that Howard had

57:20.145 --> 57:21.863
to live in, to
program that game,

57:22.147 --> 57:23.820
it really is an
astonishing master work.

57:24.107 --> 57:25.825
He made an amazing
fucking game that's

57:26.109 --> 57:28.453
a whole self-contained
world in five weeks,

57:28.737 --> 57:29.989
that's even more impressive.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.703
I don't know any human
being who could have turned

57:32.991 --> 57:34.993
E.T., in the time
frames involved,

57:35.285 --> 57:36.753
into a really successful game.

57:37.037 --> 57:38.835
He should be
applauded for being

57:39.122 --> 57:43.923
able to have done anything in
the time that was allotted.

57:44.211 --> 57:47.090
The scorn should be
heaped upon those

57:47.381 --> 57:52.228
who thought it was even rational
to try to build a cartridge

57:52.511 --> 57:53.933
in a month and a half.

57:54.221 --> 57:56.849
The analogy that people always
use for these first timers...

57:57.140 --> 57:58.983
for people who try
something first...

57:59.267 --> 58:00.814
is the first penguin analogy.

58:01.103 --> 58:03.276
Where the first penguin
who jumps down the hole

58:03.563 --> 58:05.565
through the ice is
the one who invariably

58:05.857 --> 58:06.983
gets eaten by the seal.

58:07.275 --> 58:08.948
But if there wasn't
a first penguin,

58:09.236 --> 58:10.909
then the penguins wouldn't be
going down through the ice.

58:11.196 --> 58:13.870
So, it sucks to be
the first penguin,

58:14.157 --> 58:14.983
but somebody's got to do it.

58:20.539 --> 58:22.291
So it turned
out that Joe Lewandowski

58:22.582 --> 58:24.175
had been right all along.

58:24.459 --> 58:27.838
The games were buried, almost
exactly where he had predicted.

58:28.130 --> 58:32.226
And no mercury filled pigs
popped up out of the ground.

58:32.509 --> 58:35.513
So the legend of
the burial was true.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.431
Or was it?

58:37.723 --> 58:40.021
When the archaeologists
cataloged all the games,

58:40.308 --> 58:42.561
there were a bunch
of E.T. cartridges,

58:42.853 --> 58:44.651
but nowhere near the
millions that were

58:44.938 --> 58:46.565
such a big part of the legend.

58:46.857 --> 58:51.738
In fact, E.T. made up about
10% of the total games found.

58:52.029 --> 58:54.828
The rest included some of
the best games ever made,

58:55.115 --> 58:58.494
Defender, and Centipede,
and Yar's Revenge.

58:58.785 --> 59:01.379
There was even one copy of
Adventure, which I snagged.

59:06.293 --> 59:09.422
The burial wasn't a cover
up, or done out of shame.

59:09.713 --> 59:11.590
It was a warehouse
dump done by a company

59:11.882 --> 59:13.634
in financial distress.

59:13.925 --> 59:15.802
At the time, the Alamogordo
landfill was just

59:16.094 --> 59:19.064
the most practical solution.

59:19.347 --> 59:23.193
E.T. wasn't buried because
it was the worst game ever.

59:23.477 --> 59:25.104
People called it
the worst game ever

59:25.395 --> 59:28.069
because it had been buried.

59:28.356 --> 59:30.324
And as a result, it got
blamed for destroying

59:30.609 --> 59:32.156
an entire industry.

59:32.444 --> 59:34.572
The game and its creator
had taken the rap

59:34.863 --> 59:37.286
for a crime they didn't commit.

59:37.574 --> 59:41.499
The notion that E.T.
caused the demise of Atari

59:41.787 --> 59:43.209
is simply stupid.

59:43.497 --> 59:44.919
It's just stupid.

59:45.207 --> 59:46.880
Atari committed suicide.

59:47.167 --> 59:49.044
It was not homicide.

59:49.336 --> 59:52.055
And it wasn't the
E.T. cartridge.

59:52.339 --> 59:57.689
It was a concomitant effect of
a lot of missteps in technology,

59:59.971 --> 01:00:01.564
and deployment, and marketing.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.566
Some people say E.T. destroyed
the video game industry.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:04.817
And I'm sure I've
heard that before,

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:05.944
but it's just really funny.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:07.445
No.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.823
The behavior pattern that
created the conditions

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.075
for the E.T. failure
is what destroyed

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:13.576
the video game industry.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:18.741
The cause of the fall was
Atari trying to sell yet

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:23.583
another 10 million Atari
2600s into a market that

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:24.741
was saturated.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.457
E.T. didn't destroy Atari.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.547
It wasn't good, but it
didn't destroy Atari.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:32.964
That's one of those
things people say.

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:36.054
And the reality of life
is, if enough people say,

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.014
it becomes the truth for people.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:41.601
A simple answer that
is clear and precise

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.858
will always have more power in
the world than a complex one

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:45.988
that is true.

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.110
Here's another E.T. six pack.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.245
What I
would like to see happen,

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:04.707
is I would like to see
whatever remains are recovered

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.622
will then find their
way into a museum,

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:09.257
in the service of game history.

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:11.168
Well, you
know, the city of Alamogordo

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:12.756
owns the games and
what have you that

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:14.341
came through there,
by virtue of the fact

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.802
that they were in our landfill.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.185
We might be able to
sell them on eBay.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:22.721
So, if another
terrible video game needed

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.981
to be buried, would
you be prepared to let

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:26.858
it be buried in Alamogordo?

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:28.064
Absolutely.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:29.944
Come on down, we'll
bury your game.

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:38.696
Atari was the
first great consumer company

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:40.113
to come out of Silicon Valley.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:41.197
It was exciting.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:42.370
It was different.

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:43.624
It was the first engagement
that a generation

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.377
had with computers.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.710
So a generation grew up being
introduced to the computer age

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.215
by Atari games.

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:54.628
We brought a whole massive
new entertainment medium

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.467
into public consciousness.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:59.599
So for a whole generation,
we are the definition

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.851
of the video game, here.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.352
And it's cosmic.

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:06.891
These guys really never
got their due for really

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:08.650
starting the whole industry.

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:11.562
Three lives was
invented by a person.

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.197
Flying a ship around was
invented by a person, who had

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:15.698
to figure out what that was.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:20.362
And it was so good that
it was copied everywhere.

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:22.201
And because it was
copied everywhere,

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:24.617
and because it's
so ubiquitous, it's

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.252
impossible to remember
why it was so special.

01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:30.414
I think Atari's
legacy is that we

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:35.256
started the Silicon Valley ethic
of engineers as rock stars.

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.170
It didn't exist before.

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:41.183
I think the casual
culture, the meritocracy,

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:42.888
didn't exist before.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:46.350
I believe these were
underpinnings of things that

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:49.391
made, and continue to
make, Silicon Valley

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:52.653
a special place in the world.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:57.737
And I think that Atari
will continue to endure

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:02.996
as an icon of innovation.
