'Cause that's what you do.

Thank you, Casey. Thank you for
granting me that permission.

snapping at me? -- Yes.

I think,
under the circumstances,

02:31:21.343 --> 02:31:22.833
I'm keeping
it pretty well together.

02:31:22.911 --> 02:31:25.278

-- That you're a little edgy.

-- Yeah.

-- Yeah.

notice my boot in their ass

room and shut the hell up.

Nope. Cat's out of the bag. Tell me
what you want by the end of tomorrow.

02:36:42.631 --> 02:36:44.121
Okay. Dana?

02:36:44.199 --> 02:36:46.133
<i>I know what to get Isaac.</i>

02:36:46.201 --> 02:36:47.134
What?

02:36:47.202 --> 02:36:48.636
A cheese grater.

02:36:48.704 --> 02:36:49.796
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

02:36:49.871 --> 02:36:52.670
Yeah, you think he's gonna
like a cheese grater?

02:36:52.741 --> 02:36:55.108
Well, in fact,
he told me he would --

02:36:55.177 --> 02:36:57.839
<i>with a restaurant-grade,
die-cast, stainless-steel</i>

02:36:57.913 --> 02:36:59.506
<i>granulating drum.</i>

02:36:59.581 --> 02:37:00.514
Okay.

02:37:00.582 --> 02:37:02.016
<i>I looked in a catalog.</i>

02:37:02.084 --> 02:37:03.017
[Banging]

02:37:03.085 --> 02:37:05.019
Dana...

02:37:05.087 --> 02:37:07.078
Leave me alone.

02:37:07.155 --> 02:37:08.680
-- When's he getting here?
-- Later.

02:37:08.757 --> 02:37:11.317
It's not like you don't see
this in sports all the time.

02:37:11.393 --> 02:37:14.055
I don't see it
in my family all the time.

02:37:14.129 --> 02:37:17.099
The guy's
a 240-pound linebacker

02:37:17.165 --> 02:37:19.259
dealing with a 350-pound
pulling guard, Dana,

02:37:19.334 --> 02:37:20.824
who's probably
also souped up.

02:37:20.902 --> 02:37:23.269
Kyle's just trying to keep
himself in the game. He's tr--

02:37:23.338 --> 02:37:27.400
Don't defend him,
and don't tell me how to be.

02:37:27.476 --> 02:37:30.173
He was part of a conspiracy
to buy steroids

02:37:30.245 --> 02:37:31.735
that God knows
what side effects

02:37:31.813 --> 02:37:33.804
and long-term damage
could cause.

02:37:33.882 --> 02:37:36.647
He's gonna get
suspended for eight games,

02:37:36.718 --> 02:37:38.186
so there goes the postseason.

02:37:38.253 --> 02:37:40.153
He's making
just over league minimum,

02:37:40.222 --> 02:37:41.417
and he's gonna get hit

02:37:41.490 --> 02:37:44.323
with probably a $50,000 fine,

02:37:44.392 --> 02:37:47.191
and, if the local D.A. feels like
running for something next year,

02:37:47.262 --> 02:37:50.493
he could also go to jail,
to say nothing of the fact

02:37:50.565 --> 02:37:53.000
that his name
is now also synonymous

02:37:53.068 --> 02:37:55.002
with everything
that's bad about sports.

02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:56.504
And all I'm saying is

02:37:56.571 --> 02:37:59.063
he's got enough people
telling him that right now --

02:37:59.141 --> 02:38:02.509
papers, talk radio, agents,
lawyers, the league,

02:38:02.577 --> 02:38:04.671
his teammates, his sister's
own television show,

02:38:04.746 --> 02:38:07.340
and maybe he doesn't need
any more guests at that party.

02:38:07.415 --> 02:38:08.974
And maybe...the best role

02:38:09.050 --> 02:38:11.849
that you can play right now
is as his sister, Dana,

02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:16.255
is all I'm saying.

02:38:16.324 --> 02:38:19.294
That, and don't be so edgy.

02:38:19.361 --> 02:38:21.420
I'm not edgy.
[Scoffs]

02:38:22.497 --> 02:38:24.158
I'm not edgy!

02:38:24.232 --> 02:38:25.222
[Door slams]

02:38:29.738 --> 02:38:30.864
[Sighs]

02:38:30.939 --> 02:38:32.907
[Glass crunching
under feet]

02:38:32.974 --> 02:38:35.409
Well...
[Clears throat]

02:38:35.477 --> 02:38:38.344
That'll need to be fixed.

02:38:48.256 --> 02:38:50.691
[Sleigh bells jingling]

02:38:56.832 --> 02:38:57.958
-- Hello.
-- Hello.

02:38:58.033 --> 02:39:00.331
-- I've looked at the tape.
-- For real?

02:39:00.402 --> 02:39:01.563
Quiz me.

02:39:01.636 --> 02:39:03.070
What's the third segment?

02:39:03.138 --> 02:39:04.162
Yankee Stadium.

02:39:04.239 --> 02:39:05.172
What am I wearing?

02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:07.868
Red flannel Vinatelli suit
with pearl stud earrings.

02:39:07.943 --> 02:39:09.638
How many segments
are already --

02:39:09.711 --> 02:39:10.803
I've watched the tape.

02:39:10.879 --> 02:39:12.108
Thank you.

02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:14.945
I liked it.
I was really impressed.

02:39:15.016 --> 02:39:15.949
But?

02:39:16.017 --> 02:39:18.543
No buts -- I thought
it was really good.

02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:20.179
You made some changes
from the old tape.

02:39:20.255 --> 02:39:21.950
-- <i>Yes.</i>
-- <i>I liked them.</i>

02:39:22.023 --> 02:39:23.013
You thought it was good?

02:39:23.091 --> 02:39:24.183
L-| really did.

02:39:24.259 --> 02:39:26.455
That really means
a lot to me, Danny.

02:39:26.528 --> 02:39:28.963
-- I <i>mean it.</i>
-- <i>So you'll talk to Dana?</i>

02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:30.555
-- About <i>what?</i>
-- <i>Putting me in the pool.</i>

02:39:30.632 --> 02:39:31.599
For substitute anchor?

02:39:31.666 --> 02:39:32.599
Yeah.

02:39:32.667 --> 02:39:33.634
Yeah.

02:39:33.702 --> 02:39:34.635
When?

02:39:34.703 --> 02:39:36.034
-- T-This very day.
-- Hey.

02:39:36.104 --> 02:39:37.265
<i>Hey, Casey.</i>

02:39:37.339 --> 02:39:39.034
<i>I love you, Danny.
You're the best.</i>

02:39:39.107 --> 02:39:40.438
-- Hang on.
-- What?

02:39:40.508 --> 02:39:41.771
I thought I was the best.

02:39:41.843 --> 02:39:43.106
Things change.

02:39:43.178 --> 02:39:44.703
Eh.

02:39:44.779 --> 02:39:46.679
Let me tell you about
my cheese-grater experience.

02:39:46.748 --> 02:39:48.546
I need to talk to you.

02:39:48.617 --> 02:39:50.813
VVell, is it more important than
my cheese-grater expefience,

02:39:50.886 --> 02:39:52.217
because let me tell you --

02:39:52.287 --> 02:39:54.153
Almost anything that would summon
the energy for me to speak

02:39:54.222 --> 02:39:56.486
is gonna be more important than
your cheese-grater expefience.

02:39:56.558 --> 02:39:57.491
What?

02:39:57.559 --> 02:39:59.459
So, I looked
at Natalie's reel.

02:39:59.527 --> 02:40:00.460
And?

02:40:00.528 --> 02:40:01.859
It was fine.

02:40:01.930 --> 02:40:03.261
-- But you told her it was great.
-- Yes.

02:40:03.331 --> 02:40:04.958
-- You told her you had no notes.
-- Yes.

02:40:05.033 --> 02:40:06.626
You said it was fantastic.

02:40:06.701 --> 02:40:07.896
I bolstered her confidence.

02:40:07.969 --> 02:40:09.494
You lied to her.

02:40:09.571 --> 02:40:10.732
Not so much lying as I j--

02:40:10.805 --> 02:40:11.966
-- Dan...
-- It's what I do.

02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:13.838
-- You're such a nimrod.
-- I know.

02:40:13.909 --> 02:40:15.172
What are you gonna do?

02:40:15.243 --> 02:40:16.904
[Sighs deeply]

02:40:16.978 --> 02:40:18.343
I don't know.

02:40:18.413 --> 02:40:19.642
[Laughs]

02:40:19.714 --> 02:40:21.307
-- Secretariat...
Natalie." No.

02:40:21.383 --> 02:40:22.851
-- Why?
-- Secretariat was a horse.

02:40:22.918 --> 02:40:24.010
<i>Thanks for clearing that up.</i>

02:40:24.085 --> 02:40:26.884
He won the final leg of the '73
Triple Crown by 31 lengths.

02:40:26.955 --> 02:40:29.720
He was the most successful
horse in the history of racing,

02:40:29.791 --> 02:40:31.520
and the most successful
stud as well.

02:40:31.593 --> 02:40:33.220
<i>Hey, ff that's gonna be the
criteria, then why don't we</i> --

02:40:33.295 --> 02:40:35.195
When he died, they did an autopsy.
You know what they found?

02:40:35.263 --> 02:40:37.755
Unless you say Jesse Owens, you're
not gonna win this argument.

02:40:37.832 --> 02:40:40.631
They found his heart was twice
the size of a normal one.

02:40:40.702 --> 02:40:42.329
Secretariat died
of an enlarged heart?

02:40:42.404 --> 02:40:43.769
No, I'm saying he had
the heart of a champion.

02:40:43.838 --> 02:40:45.203
And I'm saying he had
the heart of a horse.

02:40:45.273 --> 02:40:47.401
Is it possible we're going
about this all wrong?

02:40:47.475 --> 02:40:48.874
I wouldn't put it past us.

02:40:48.944 --> 02:40:51.208
-- Instead of athlete of the century...
-- VVait for it.

02:40:51.279 --> 02:40:53.304
Athlete of the millennium.

02:40:53.381 --> 02:40:55.679
Athlete of the millennium.

02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:57.980
-- <i>Yes.</i> -- <i>You're saying
we go back to the court</i>

02:40:58.053 --> 02:40:59.543
of Ferdinand and Isabella
and look for --

02:40:59.621 --> 02:41:01.646
Sure.
Ferdinand, the Aztecs,

02:41:01.723 --> 02:41:03.953
Richard the Lionheart --
Genghis Khan could bring it.

02:41:04.025 --> 02:41:05.754
-- Anything else?

02:41:05.827 --> 02:41:06.794
Back in two hours.

02:41:06.861 --> 02:41:07.987
Sir Thomas More.

02:41:08.063 --> 02:41:08.996
-- Jeremy?
-- Yeah?

02:41:09.064 --> 02:41:10.259
Can I talk
to you for a moment?

02:41:10.332 --> 02:41:11.527
Sure.

02:41:13.401 --> 02:41:15.836
The Plantagenets, you know,
were very tough to beat.

02:41:15.904 --> 02:41:17.838
Okay, so, listen, sol
looked at Natalie's reel.

02:41:17.906 --> 02:41:18.998
Yeah?

02:41:19.074 --> 02:41:20.473
And it's good,
but she wants me

02:41:20.542 --> 02:41:22.476
to recommend her to Dana
for a spot in the rotation,

02:41:22.544 --> 02:41:24.706
and, while I definitely think she'll get
there one day, she's not there yet.

02:41:24.779 --> 02:41:25.712
Tell her that.

02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:26.906
-- You think?
-- Be honest.

02:41:26.982 --> 02:41:29.076
Well, the thing is --

02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:31.016
-- It's too late for that?
-- Yeah.

02:41:31.086 --> 02:41:32.884
-- You got to tell her. This is
important to her. -- I know. I know.

02:41:32.954 --> 02:41:34.888
If you don't tell her,
I'm gonna have to.

02:41:34.956 --> 02:41:36.117
It's funny you should
bring that up.

02:41:36.191 --> 02:41:37.386
In your dreams.

02:41:37.459 --> 02:41:40.019
I'd like you to bear in mind
that I am your secret Santa.

02:41:40.095 --> 02:41:42.223
-- What are you getting me? -- I was
gonna take you to Midnight Mass.

02:41:42.297 --> 02:41:44.459
Talk to her, Danny.

02:41:44.532 --> 02:41:47.194
Yeah...yeah.

02:41:50.405 --> 02:41:52.464
<i>Casey: Isaac.</i>

02:41:52.540 --> 02:41:53.473
Yes, sir?

02:41:53.541 --> 02:41:55.839
-- I've been shopping.
-- I can see that.

02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:57.173
You would be amazed

02:41:57.245 --> 02:41:59.509
at how many different kinds
of cheese graters there are.

02:41:59.581 --> 02:42:02.016
After working with you
for 31/2 years,

02:42:02.083 --> 02:42:03.744
very little amazes me.

02:42:03.818 --> 02:42:07.220
Now, I bought 12 of the best
cheese graters I could find.

02:42:07.288 --> 02:42:08.722
I thought you could
pick the one you want,

02:42:08.790 --> 02:42:09.951
and then I'll just
give the rest

02:42:10.025 --> 02:42:11.550
to, you know, people
who need cheese graters.

02:42:11.626 --> 02:42:14.061
Plenty of those people
around the holidays.

02:42:14.129 --> 02:42:16.655
Yeah. Anyway, I thought
you'd know which one was best,

02:42:16.731 --> 02:42:18.631
so if you want to just --

02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:19.690
-- Casey?
-- Yeah?

02:42:19.768 --> 02:42:21.998
I don't know anything
about cheese graters.

02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:24.368
Uh, what do you mean?

02:42:24.439 --> 02:42:26.134
I mean, I'm no more
qualified to pick a good --

02:42:26.207 --> 02:42:27.732
You said you like
to grate cheese.

02:42:27.809 --> 02:42:30.141
Well, it's not
something I hate.

02:42:30.211 --> 02:42:33.374
Isaac, I wanted to get you
something that you wanted.

02:42:33.448 --> 02:42:36.850
I don't like instructing
people on what to buy me.

02:42:36.918 --> 02:42:38.943
Yeah, but then you end up
with a cheese grater.

02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:42.012
Mmm, I love my cheese grater.

02:42:42.090 --> 02:42:44.889
Which one?

02:42:44.959 --> 02:42:47.485
Grab that one off the top.

02:42:47.562 --> 02:42:50.429
[Sighs]

02:42:50.498 --> 02:42:53.934
A famous monk once said,
"I don't always know

02:42:54.002 --> 02:42:56.437
"what the right thing
to do is, my Lord,

02:42:56.504 --> 02:42:59.940
"but I think the fact
that I want to please you

02:43:00.008 --> 02:43:01.476
pleases you."

02:43:01.543 --> 02:43:03.978
But you would have
preferred a book

02:43:04.045 --> 02:43:05.479
of famous monk quotations.

02:43:05.547 --> 02:43:08.244
<i>No, you put
some thought into me.</i>

02:43:08.316 --> 02:43:10.546
What could be
a greater gift?

02:43:10.618 --> 02:43:12.712
I look like an idiot.

02:43:12.787 --> 02:43:14.221
Added bonus.

02:43:14.289 --> 02:43:16.189
Yeah, I suppose.

02:43:16.257 --> 02:43:18.419
You know, there's still
plenty of time left.

02:43:18.493 --> 02:43:20.257
I'm gonna find you
something you want.

02:43:20.328 --> 02:43:21.261
Mm-hmm.

02:43:21.329 --> 02:43:22.421
See you later.

02:43:22.497 --> 02:43:23.487
Okay.

02:43:30.505 --> 02:43:32.132
[Groans]

02:43:55.563 --> 02:43:57.122
-- Hey, there.
-- Hi.

02:43:57.198 --> 02:43:58.427
How you doin'?

02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:00.491
-- I'm late for a rundown.
So are you. -- Yeah.

02:44:00.568 --> 02:44:01.865
Uh, did you talk to Dana yet?

02:44:01.936 --> 02:44:03.199
-- Natalie?
-- Yeah?

02:44:03.271 --> 02:44:04.432
You've got
a lot of potential.

02:44:04.506 --> 02:44:06.372
You know your stuff, you can
write, and you look good.

02:44:06.441 --> 02:44:09.035
-- So what's the problem? -- You're a
couple of years away from being ready.

02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:12.740
[Chuckles]
A couple of years?

02:44:12.814 --> 02:44:16.216
Yeah, if you're lucky.

02:44:16.284 --> 02:44:18.446
-- Dan, you... -- I was blowing
you off before. I'm sorry.

02:44:21.723 --> 02:44:24.590
-- A couple of years?
-- Yeah.

02:44:24.659 --> 02:44:25.990
Why?

02:44:26.060 --> 02:44:29.052
'Cause that's how hard it is
to make this look easy.

02:44:29.130 --> 02:44:32.156
I once thought being a
field-goal kicker looked easy

02:44:32.233 --> 02:44:34.065
till 11 guys running after me

02:44:34.135 --> 02:44:36.797
demonstrated why I should
never try it again.

02:44:36.871 --> 02:44:39.033
Are you telling me
to never try it again?

02:44:39.107 --> 02:44:41.974
No, I'm telling you that “A“ --
it wasn't as easy as it looked,

02:44:42.043 --> 02:44:44.808
and “B“ -- if I'd have kept at
it despite early frustrations,

02:44:44.879 --> 02:44:46.643
I might have been
a field-goal kicker.

02:44:46.714 --> 02:44:49.547
Is that what you really
wanted to do?

02:44:49.617 --> 02:44:52.552
No, I wanted to do this.
What do you want to do?

02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:54.349
Just something more.

02:44:54.422 --> 02:44:56.356
Then keep doing
what you're doing,

02:44:56.424 --> 02:45:00.224
'cause you're heading
in the right direction.

02:45:00.295 --> 02:45:01.729
Thanks, Danny.

02:45:01.796 --> 02:45:02.957
Sure.

02:45:03.698 --> 02:45:04.995
Ow.

02:45:05.066 --> 02:45:07.899
-- That was for lying to me all day.
<i>__ I</i> Vv__

02:45:07.969 --> 02:45:10.131
And that was for doing it during this
holiday season of peace and joy.

02:45:10.205 --> 02:45:12.264
Okay.

02:45:16.110 --> 02:45:17.043
We have a meeting.

02:45:17.111 --> 02:45:18.510
Thank you.

02:45:23.151 --> 02:45:27.782
Melankomas -- he fought
in the year 49 A.D.

02:45:27.855 --> 02:45:28.913
Melankomas.

02:45:28.990 --> 02:45:31.049
Melankomas of Caria.
He was 53-0.

02:45:31.125 --> 02:45:32.524
<i>So was Jersey Joe Walcott.</i>

02:45:32.594 --> 02:45:34.358
Yes, but the difference
is this --

02:45:34.429 --> 02:45:36.227
Melankomas won
all 53 of his fights

02:45:36.297 --> 02:45:37.856
without ever
throwing a punch.

02:45:37.932 --> 02:45:39.593
He never threw a punch?

02:45:39.667 --> 02:45:40.862
He never threw a punch,
and he never got hit.

02:45:40.935 --> 02:45:42.699
-- I don't understand.
-- Me, neither.

02:45:42.770 --> 02:45:46.263
-- He won 53 fights without ever throwing a
punch or without ever getting hit? -- Yes.

02:45:46.341 --> 02:45:49.276
Would he just talk his way
into the opponent surrendering?

02:45:49.344 --> 02:45:50.505
Possibly.
If that's the case,

02:45:50.578 --> 02:45:52.672
then "Sports Night"'s
certainly found its poster boy.

02:45:52.747 --> 02:45:55.682
If he fought in 49 A.D.,
then he's 1,000 years too young.

02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:58.651
Melankomas is the athlete
of the last millennium.

02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:01.052
You see, I say he was man
enough for both millennia.

02:46:01.122 --> 02:46:03.853
I say we go with Muhammad Ali
and be done with it.

02:46:03.925 --> 02:46:05.893
-- Muhammad Ali! -- Muhammad Ali!
-- Muhammad Ali!

02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:07.257
[Telephone rings]

02:46:07.328 --> 02:46:09.524
Ali's great, but I still say
he wouldn't get by Melankomas.

02:46:09.597 --> 02:46:11.463
Not unless he, you know,
hit him once.

02:46:11.532 --> 02:46:12.226
[Laughter]

02:46:12.300 --> 02:46:13.267
What's next?

02:46:13.334 --> 02:46:14.267
-- Dana?
-- Yeah?

02:46:14.335 --> 02:46:16.736
Your brother's here.
He's in your office.

02:46:16.804 --> 02:46:20.934
Thank you.
I'll be back in a minute.

02:46:21.009 --> 02:46:23.774
[Telephones ringing]

02:46:23.845 --> 02:46:25.210
I was thinking --
if you want --

02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:27.305
you could make a tape
of my favorite songs --

02:46:27.382 --> 02:46:29.908
you know, a party mix, something
I could play in the car.

02:46:29.984 --> 02:46:32.544
It'd be kind of fun for you
'cause then you could go around

02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:33.985
asking people
what my favorite songs are,

02:46:34.055 --> 02:46:35.682
like a little
holiday detective.

02:47:14.962 --> 02:47:17.363

the years, the studying,

02:47:17.432 --> 02:47:19.833
the weight rooms,
the practices, the two-a-days --

02:47:19.901 --> 02:47:21.198
You don't have to tell me
how hard it is

02:47:21.269 --> 02:47:23.431
to play pro ball, Dana.
I play pro ball.

02:47:23.504 --> 02:47:24.903
Who turned you on
to this stuff?

02:47:24.972 --> 02:47:26.269
-- <i>Dana...</i>
-- <i>I know that locker room.</i>

02:47:26.341 --> 02:47:27.274
-- <i>Was it Jason?</i>
-- <i>Listen...</i>

02:47:27.342 --> 02:47:28.036
Was it Jason?

02:47:28.109 --> 02:47:29.668
It's not important.

02:47:29.744 --> 02:47:33.408
What the hell kind of judge
are you of what's important?

02:47:33.481 --> 02:47:37.714
I have stood and cheered for you
since you were 10 years old,

you picked up a football.

that these are the moments

get paid for,

02:48:42.250 --> 02:48:46.084
