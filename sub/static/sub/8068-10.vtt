WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:07.208
[theme music]

00:56.224 --> 00:57.024
DAN: I looked everywhere.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.959
Where's the good rags?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.330
They're hanging
up in your closet.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.198
All I can find is
this flimsy stuff.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.067
I need substantial rags
to work on the truck.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.270
[phone ringing]

01:09.370 --> 01:10.571
Hello?
Hey, Dwight.

01:10.671 --> 01:11.472
What's up?

01:11.572 --> 01:15.409
[laughs] Besides that.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.711
Oh yeah, bring the
whole wrench set.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.347
No, we got plenty beer.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.549
All right, see you
a few, buckaroo.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.950
Is Dwight coming over here?

01:23.050 --> 01:24.252
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

01:24.352 --> 01:25.619
Nothing.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.789
Just every time you're with
him, your IQ drops 10 points.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.090
Hey, he's bringing
his tools over.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.925
He's going to help
me tune up the truck.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.895
Oh you're not going to
get that truck tuned up.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.730
You guys are just going to
be up there in the driveway,

01:36.830 --> 01:40.768
drinking beer and spitting
and talking about who's

01:40.868 --> 01:42.203
got the biggest hood ornament.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.007
Hell, honey, that's
not even a contest.

01:49.210 --> 01:49.977
I know.

01:50.077 --> 01:53.414
No one can spit like you, honey.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.848
I love watching you with Dwight.

01:54.948 --> 01:55.983
You guys are so funny.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.286
You're like, yeah I bet
those bears are going

01:58.386 --> 01:59.587
to kick some butt on Sunday.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.327
You got that down.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.262
Maybe you should come out and
help us work on the truck.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.463
I probably should.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.299
That's the only way you'll
probably get it done.

02:11.399 --> 02:15.569
You and Dwight never finish
nothing but a six pack.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.339
It so happens Dwight and I
have finished a lot of stuff.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.842
Yeah, like that utility room
you started three years ago?

02:21.942 --> 02:23.811
Utility room is not a truck.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.246
Could I embroider
that on a pillow?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.418
Yes.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.985
And you can embroider this.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.821
By 4 o'clock this
afternoon, that truck

02:33.921 --> 02:35.189
will have new points
and plugs and will

02:35.289 --> 02:36.857
be running like a race car.
- Oh yeah?

02:36.957 --> 02:37.958
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

02:38.058 --> 02:38.992
Yeah!

02:39.092 --> 02:41.128
Would you care to
make a small wager?

02:41.229 --> 02:43.831
Oh, name it.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.535
OK, if that truck ain't
working by 4 o'clock, then

02:47.635 --> 02:49.803
you gotta clean this oven
today and every month

02:49.903 --> 02:50.804
for the rest of your life.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.844
Fine.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.547
But if I win, which
I will, you've

02:59.647 --> 03:02.216
got to do all the snow shoveling
this winter and every winter

03:02.316 --> 03:03.251
for the rest of your life.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.220
All right.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.120
You're on, buckaroo.

03:09.957 --> 03:14.262
Here you go, one peanut
butter and jelly sandwich

03:14.362 --> 03:16.497
coming right up.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.966
I like it better with
the peanut butter on top.

03:23.971 --> 03:24.838
There you go.

03:27.841 --> 03:28.642
Hey, Roseanne.

03:28.742 --> 03:29.777
ROSEANNE: Hi, Dwight.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.811
Hey there, scooter.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.981
Hi, Mr. Goodworth.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.816
What are you doing, Dwight?

03:35.916 --> 03:37.084
Beer break.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.119
Well, you don't just
go in somebody's house

03:39.219 --> 03:41.855
and start taking stuff
out of their fridge.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.524
Um, Dan said I could.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.493
Well, what Dan says
don't matter around here.

03:45.593 --> 03:49.430
He knows that.
- You hear that, Dan?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.631
DAN: It's true.

03:50.731 --> 03:54.134
I'm merely a figurehead.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.369
I hear you're
going to be shoveling

03:55.469 --> 03:56.404
some snow this winter.

03:56.504 --> 03:57.305
Yeah, Roz.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.639
You better be nice to Dwight.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.742
He said he could get you a
good discount on a snow blower.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.777
- You think Freddy wants a beer?
- He's breathing, ain't he?

04:06.580 --> 04:07.848
Is Freddy out there too?

04:07.948 --> 04:10.150
DAN: Yep, got all three
of us on the job now.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.120
Getting worried, girl?

04:13.220 --> 04:14.021
Ah, yeah.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.223
I'm shaking in my boots.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.426
Don't stick your
finger in there.

04:18.526 --> 04:19.827
It tastes better that way.

04:19.927 --> 04:20.728
That's disgusting.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.530
Want me to put it back?

04:22.630 --> 04:26.233
Dan, you told me
he was housebroken.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.134
I lied.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.602
[whistles] Come on, boy.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.570
[slapping leg]

04:29.670 --> 04:31.104
Hold on there, Dan.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.575
Hey, Chiquita Rosarita, is that
little sister of yours going

04:34.675 --> 04:35.809
to be around here today?

04:35.909 --> 04:37.545
What do you care?

04:37.645 --> 04:40.681
Boy, can't a man ask a simple
question without some woman

04:40.781 --> 04:42.115
giving him the third degree?

04:42.215 --> 04:46.454
Well, not when that man's
you and the woman is my sister.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.490
What kind of crazy thoughts are
rattling around that empty head

04:49.590 --> 04:51.024
of yours, Dwight?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.493
Just want to
talk to her is all.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.727
ROSEANNE: About what?

04:53.827 --> 04:56.430
Nothing.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.499
Are you thinking
about asking her out?

04:58.599 --> 04:59.400
Maybe.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.802
ROSEANNE: On a date?

05:01.902 --> 05:03.236
Sorta.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.438
Well, forget about it, Dwight.

05:04.538 --> 05:08.709
My sister don't
date Neanderthals.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.544
Why?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.445
Come on, Dwight.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.946
We got a lot of work to do.

05:13.046 --> 05:16.049
Take that beer out to Freddy.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.618
ROSEANNE: Dan.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.753
[droopy voice] Yes, dear.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.122
Why didn't you tell me
he's got the hots for Jackie?

05:22.222 --> 05:23.391
News to me.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.859
Yeah, he's not going
out with my sister.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.462
Why don't we just let them
work out their own lives?

05:28.562 --> 05:31.298
'Cause they'll
just mess them up.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.633
Rosie.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.836
Why must you mere mortals
gamble with your own thoughts

05:35.936 --> 05:38.372
when you have the
goddess of corn here

05:38.472 --> 05:39.973
to keep you from screwing up?

05:43.677 --> 05:44.478
Here, Dad.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.116
Thanks, Son.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.918
DWIGHT: Hey, scooter,
do you want to go ask

05:51.018 --> 05:52.019
your mom for some more chips?

05:52.119 --> 05:52.920
OK.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.824
Hey, take it
easy there, Dwight.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.526
I wouldn't want you
to strain yourself.

05:58.626 --> 05:59.460
Don't worry, pal.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.228
I lift with my
legs, not my back.

06:04.064 --> 06:04.865
Hey, Dan.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.700
Yeah.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.101
Jackie ain't dating
anybody, is she?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.002
Nobody'd have her.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.371
Hand me that screwdriver, Fred.

06:11.472 --> 06:14.575
Pretty obvious she's
got a thing for me.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.647
Oh yeah?

06:19.747 --> 06:20.848
Yep.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.551
She was in my hardware
store last Thursday,

06:23.651 --> 06:26.920
asking me a lot of questions
about those new cordless drills

06:27.020 --> 06:29.289
I got in.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.824
Yeah, those are nice.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.993
But that's not what
she was shopping for,

06:33.093 --> 06:34.695
if you catch my drift.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.930
Dwight you own
a hardware store.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.366
Have you considered the remote
possibility that Jackie came in

06:39.467 --> 06:41.068
because she needed something?

06:41.168 --> 06:42.402
Oh, she needed
something, all right.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.672
[laughs]

06:44.772 --> 06:45.773
Oh that's right.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.308
I forgot, you're the
real expert with women.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.343
Yeah, I guess I know my way
around the hen house all right.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.779
Yeah, probably so,
since you're still

06:51.879 --> 06:54.214
living at home with your mom.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.716
DWIGHT: Hey-- hey--

06:55.816 --> 06:57.284
My mom needs me.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.123
Yum.

07:03.223 --> 07:06.594
Well, Freddy, I see you're
making a heck of a difference,

07:06.694 --> 07:07.495
there.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.996
You guys already
got the hood up.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.798
Yeah.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.634
We got your hardcore
labor going on.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.504
Yeah, I see Dwight's
laboring to suck the bottom out

07:16.604 --> 07:18.806
of that beer can.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.708
Dad, can I get in the truck?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.910
Sure, go ahead bub.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.978
ROSEANNE: Well, let me
see what kind of mess

07:25.078 --> 07:26.580
you're making around here.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.150
Why, we're so far ahead,
we're ready for another break.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.451
We already pulled
the points and plugs,

07:31.552 --> 07:33.320
and now we're setting the gaps.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.789
Ah, what are you
talking motors to her for?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.157
It's a waste of breath, Dan.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.560
Well, he's right,
Dan, you know.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.261
The female mind
just can't handle

07:41.361 --> 07:43.964
the complexities of the
modern combustion engine.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.938
It's a proven fact.

07:51.038 --> 07:51.972
Right, Freddy?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.306
That's right.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.843
Oh look at all these wires
and gizmos and thingamabobs.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.078
Oh it just makes my head spin.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.850
It's typical.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.185
You know, I say if you
can't find the fan belt,

08:05.285 --> 08:07.855
you shouldn't get behind
the steering wheel.

08:07.955 --> 08:08.889
Am I right, Dan?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.023
You're on your
own here, Dwight.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.362
Tell you what I'd
do with you women.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.831
I'd take all your
little licenses away,

08:17.931 --> 08:19.933
and I'd put you girls
on public transportation

08:20.033 --> 08:22.536
where youse belong.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.004
I'm amazed you're
not the governor.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.609
I wouldn't vote for you.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.943
[horn honks]

08:30.043 --> 08:32.212
Damn it, don't honk that
when I'm working on the engine.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.581
Sorry, Mr. Meeker.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.481
Don't worry, scooter.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.084
He didn't hit anything he uses.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.952
Mom, can I ride my bike?

08:39.052 --> 08:42.155
Yeah, but ride in
real heavy traffic.

08:42.255 --> 08:45.893
Ha ha, that's so
funny, I forgot to laugh.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.528
Now you boys pick
up all your beer cans

08:48.629 --> 08:50.964
and put your little toys
away, and when you're all

08:51.064 --> 08:53.801
done playing, you push
this big blue truck

08:53.901 --> 08:57.104
right out of the driveway.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.506
Boy, I'll tell you what, Dan.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.575
Every morning I wake up,
get down on my knees,

09:01.675 --> 09:04.845
and thank the good Lord up above
I'm not married to that woman.

09:04.945 --> 09:08.982
Yeah, I think Rosie is
pretty much OK about that too.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.384
You know, if my woman
ever talked to me that way,

09:11.484 --> 09:12.352
you know what I'd say to her?

09:12.452 --> 09:13.721
Yeah, get back
in the house, ma.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.324
Hi, you guys.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.491
How are you doing?

09:18.592 --> 09:19.392
DAN: Hey, how was the mall?

09:19.492 --> 09:20.761
Oh, it was wonderful.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.395
We ate corn dogs
by the fountain.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.764
CRYSTAL: We sure did.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.265
DWIGHT: Hey, Jackie.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.967
Hi.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.703
Oh, Dwight, hi.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.705
Poor thing.

09:31.805 --> 09:35.442
Gotta hate it when a girl
embarrasses herself like that.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.910
What are you
talking about, Dwight?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.245
It's obvious.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.347
The woman wants me.

09:40.447 --> 09:44.151
Yeah, so does the
animal research lab.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.954
[music playing]

09:49.389 --> 09:51.424
Roseanne, look at these.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.793
Isn't this the sweetest thing?

09:52.893 --> 09:55.629
JACKIE: 39.95, marked
down from 89.99.

09:55.729 --> 09:56.630
Wow.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.732
This is the kind
of thing men love.

09:58.832 --> 10:02.803
Or you could wear a sign
that said, free sample.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.004
CRYSTAL: Get out.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.373
You see, if I wear this
I'll feel more feminine.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.141
And if I feel more
feminine, I'll

10:08.241 --> 10:09.943
radiate this
mysterious sensuality,

10:10.043 --> 10:11.845
and men will flock to me.

10:11.945 --> 10:16.083
They won't know what it
is, but they'll want it.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.151
Yeah, that's kinda the
way they feel about chili.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.892
Mom, look at the ankle
bracelet aunt Jackie bought me.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.293
ROSEANNE: You.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.662
You, know Dan bought me one of
those when we first got married

10:28.762 --> 10:30.063
and he had it engraved.

10:30.163 --> 10:30.964
It said, POW.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.769
I also got six
colors of blush.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.637
Crystal is going to help
me find my perfect shade.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.906
Let's do it, sugar.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.709
I'll have you looking
like a CoverGirl.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.744
ROSEANNE: And once again the
mall has turned out to be

10:43.844 --> 10:46.013
the ultimate zen experience.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.183
JACKIE: Roseanne, come here.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.418
You got to see this.

10:51.518 --> 10:55.222
Dwight's out here balancing
beer cans on his head.

10:55.322 --> 10:59.192
He usually don't take
his vacation til summer.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.527
He's doing three cans.

11:00.627 --> 11:01.561
That's hard to do.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.097
Well, not when you're in love.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.333
What you're witnessing
is the rarely

11:06.433 --> 11:08.736
seen primitive mating
dance of the North

11:08.836 --> 11:10.237
American grease monkey.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.642
And guess who he's
dancing for, sister?

11:15.743 --> 11:18.245
Hint, hint, hint.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.013
I was down at his
hardware store the other day

11:20.113 --> 11:22.716
and he followed me
around like a puppy.

11:22.816 --> 11:23.817
He's kind of cute.

11:23.917 --> 11:24.918
Cute?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.787
I bet his parents are
brother and sister.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.262
I could do worse.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.832
You have done worse, Jackie.

11:38.932 --> 11:39.933
Well, maybe you're right.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.034
I don't know.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.772
He is single, and he
has his own business.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.940
And he's never been in prison.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.810
I think he likes women.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.345
When you consider the
meat market in Lanford,

11:52.445 --> 11:53.914
he's not so bad.

11:54.014 --> 11:57.851
Yeah, he kind of reminds
me of a big old rump roast.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.154
No, there's some good
raw material out there.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.756
This guy's got potential.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.158
With a little bit of work, he
could get whipped into shape.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.626
Look what you did with Dan.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.296
True, but I'm a unique and
incredible woman, Jackie.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.434
And you're saying
that I'm not?

12:14.534 --> 12:15.535
Yeah.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.537
I'll have you know
that somebody like me,

12:17.637 --> 12:19.706
who is tolerant and sensitive--

12:19.807 --> 12:21.208
And insane.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.143
I could show you a whole
nother side of Dwight.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.677
I could go out there
right now and show you

12:24.778 --> 12:26.646
a Dwight that behaves
like a perfect gentleman.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.815
Oh, right.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.116
JACKIE: I'll do it, too.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.885
[laughs] You know,
Jackie, you really

12:31.985 --> 12:34.221
should try Earth sometime.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.722
I think you might like it.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.628
I tell you what, fellas.

12:41.728 --> 12:44.932
You let women in as umpires, you
can kiss the game of baseball

12:45.032 --> 12:46.266
right down the toilet.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.167
BEATRICE: Freddy!

12:47.267 --> 12:49.336
Do you know what time it is?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.038
Coming, honey.
All right, fellas.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.039
I got to go.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.406
Yeah, you better run.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.809
I hear the warden calling you.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.144
Thanks a lot, Freddy.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.646
Promised Beatrice I'd wash
the screens this afternoon.

12:59.746 --> 13:00.981
See you.

13:01.081 --> 13:01.882
So long.

13:01.982 --> 13:02.782
Wimp.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.785
[laughter]

13:05.886 --> 13:06.854
What time is it anyway?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.121
- It's 10 to 4:00.
- Ah!

13:08.221 --> 13:09.056
10 to 4:00!

13:09.156 --> 13:10.390
Dwight, get over
here and help me.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.925
We got ten minutes to
get this engine running.

13:12.025 --> 13:12.826
Hey, never fear.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.061
The tool man's here.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.662
Help me hook up these cables.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.197
JACKIE: Hi, guys,
what's kicking?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.098
Hey Jackie.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.367
Hi, Dwight.

13:20.467 --> 13:24.071
Hey, you got all your gaps
adjusted, there, Danny boy.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.305
Don't bother me, now Roseanne.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.206
I'm on a roll.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.607
Come on Dwight, get over here.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.442
Hey just a second.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.444
How was your little
shopping trip there, Jackie?

13:31.544 --> 13:32.512
Oh, it was good.

13:32.612 --> 13:33.646
We hit every sale.
DWIGHT: Yeah?

13:33.746 --> 13:34.581
Yeah.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.449
I bet you like
those malls, huh?

13:36.549 --> 13:38.986
All them shoe stores.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.553
ROSEANNE: Oh, Jackie
loves buying shoes,

13:40.653 --> 13:41.855
don't you, Jackie.

13:41.955 --> 13:45.258
JACKIE: I do happen
to enjoy it, Roseanne.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.427
DWIGHT: Boy, the way
you ladies buy shoes--

13:47.527 --> 13:51.764
think you all had six
feet on every leg.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.167
Dwight, what did you do
with the distributor cap?

13:54.267 --> 13:55.168
I didn't have it.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.069
Yeah, you did.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.471
Well, it's over
there somewhere.

13:58.571 --> 14:02.009
Oh!
Oh wow doggone it!

14:02.109 --> 14:04.344
It's this darn money clip.
It's nothing.

14:04.444 --> 14:08.348
It keeps poking me in the leg.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.249
Look at that, would you?

14:09.349 --> 14:12.552
I'm losing all my darn money.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.588
Yeah, I guess that
itty bitty little money

14:15.688 --> 14:17.490
clip's just too much
for that great big wad

14:17.590 --> 14:20.493
of yours, huh Dwight?

14:20.593 --> 14:22.729
Like to keep my
money neat is all.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.933
Neatness is an admirable
quality in a gentleman.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.068
Yeah, I'm-- I'm
really a neat gentleman.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.137
DAN: Dwight, the distributor
cap is not over here.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.238
Well, it's
somewhere else then.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.973
- Where?
- In the garage maybe.

14:36.843 --> 14:41.448
Oh, gee I think my watch
is wrong, Jackie, because it

14:41.548 --> 14:42.415
says it's almost 4 o'clock.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.018
But it couldn't be
almost 4 o'clock,

14:45.118 --> 14:47.154
'cause if it was
almost 4 o'clock,

14:47.254 --> 14:50.823
I'd hear this truck
purring like a race car.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.226
It ain't over til it's over.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.463
You guys gonna this tank
up and rattling again?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.597
Yeah.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.767
Pretty sorry piece of
scrap iron isn't it?

15:00.867 --> 15:02.335
You ever seen my car?

15:02.435 --> 15:04.271
That lime green convertible?

15:04.371 --> 15:05.905
Yeah.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.540
My monster.

15:07.640 --> 15:11.311
It's got a bored out
327 with dual quads.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.613
Can do 125 MPHs.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.848
No wonder your mom wears
her hair straight back.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.393
I can't find that damn
distributor cap anywhere.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.294
Did you look for it?

15:29.896 --> 15:31.198
No.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.766
I was out there tearing up my
garage just for the hell of it!

15:33.866 --> 15:38.338
ROSEANNE: [laughs] Well, Dan you
should go look in the kitchen.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.739
Why would it be
in the kitchen?

15:39.839 --> 15:44.011
Because everything in the free
world ends up in the kitchen.

15:44.111 --> 15:44.911
Dwight

15:45.012 --> 15:46.379
Huh?

15:46.479 --> 15:49.949
What did you do with
the distributor cap?

15:50.050 --> 15:52.719
Um, far left hand
corner of the tool shelf,

15:52.819 --> 15:54.621
behind motor oil.

15:54.721 --> 15:55.788
And you know what?

15:55.888 --> 15:58.825
You got five minutes and
29 seconds to find it.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.193
When I find that
distributor cap,

16:00.293 --> 16:02.595
you're going to be shoveling
snow for the rest of your life.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.765
Five minutes and 27 seconds.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.134
DARLENE: Mom!

16:07.234 --> 16:09.002
I'm busy!

16:09.102 --> 16:12.172
DARLENE: I can't get your
sewing machine to stop.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.906
Oh, Darlene stay away from it.

16:14.007 --> 16:17.210
Don't touch anything.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.847
It's a three ring
circus around here.

16:20.947 --> 16:24.851
Yeah.
And Dan's the dancing bear.

16:24.951 --> 16:27.087
You know Dwight, I
was talking to Roseanne

16:27.187 --> 16:31.158
and I told her that I thought
you were a pretty good guy.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.059
Really?

16:35.595 --> 16:39.666
Hey listen, Jackie, you know,
ever since you were in my store

16:39.766 --> 16:41.968
last week, I've been thinking.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.437
About what?

16:44.537 --> 16:45.938
About you.

16:46.039 --> 16:46.906
- Really?
- Really.

16:47.006 --> 16:47.807
Aww.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.642
[laughs]

16:49.742 --> 16:53.380
I've been thinking, you know,
maybe, you'd like me to come

16:53.480 --> 16:56.049
over to your place sometime.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.484
We could do that.

16:57.584 --> 16:58.385
Yeah?

16:58.485 --> 16:59.352
JACKIE: Yeah.

16:59.452 --> 17:03.923
[tense laughter]

17:04.023 --> 17:08.195
Maybe I could give your
engine a little tune up.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.096
A tune up?

17:09.196 --> 17:11.198
No my car's OK.

17:11.298 --> 17:14.134
I'm talking
about your engines.

17:14.234 --> 17:18.371
Engines I tune stay tuned,
you know what I mean?

17:18.471 --> 17:20.707
Yeah, I know what
you mean, Dwight.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.076
Well, I tell you what, Jackie.

17:23.176 --> 17:26.946
With a chassis like yours, it'd
be a pleasure to pop your hood.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.582
What do you say?

17:29.682 --> 17:33.986
I say I think
you just blew it.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.965
Say, guy.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.667
Yeah.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.935
You OK?

17:49.035 --> 17:50.570
Oh, sure.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.139
I was only asking
her out because she's

17:52.239 --> 17:53.140
your sister-in-law.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.507
DAN: Yeah.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.177
Hey man, her loss.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.611
Why can't I meet a
guy who's interested

17:58.711 --> 18:01.881
in something other than getting
his hands on my chassis?

18:01.981 --> 18:05.352
Well, Jackie, I'm sure
there's three or four guys

18:05.452 --> 18:06.553
like that left in the world.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.289
They just ain't in my driveway.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.058
If I could you meet a
guy with half a brain,

18:12.159 --> 18:14.561
an ounce of courage, and
a little bit of heart,

18:14.661 --> 18:16.496
I'd fall in love.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.265
Follow the yellow brick road.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.166
Momma?

18:19.266 --> 18:20.433
Jackie?

18:20.533 --> 18:21.801
Which is my perfect shade?

18:21.901 --> 18:23.903
We put three different
blushes on her cheek.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.738
Pick the one you like best.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.240
Oh I like it over here.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.609
Oh, this looks great over there.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.810
Mom, there's no blush there.

18:30.910 --> 18:31.844
I like this middle one.

18:31.944 --> 18:32.979
That's one Crystal picked.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.148
It's called pinch of plum.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.516
Yummy.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.051
CRYSTAL: Honey, you put on
that blush like I showed you,

18:39.152 --> 18:40.887
you'll have the boys
standing in line.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.989
Thanks, Crystal.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.192
Well, this has been fun.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.092
But I have to get home.

18:49.229 --> 18:52.332
- Bye, Dan.
- See you, Crystal.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.966
ROSEANNE: It's 4 o'clock.

18:54.066 --> 18:59.406
Hark, I believe I hear a
dirty oven calling you.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.307
It's fine.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.574
You win your stupid bet.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.675
But I was under a handicap.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.976
You took away my best man.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.645
What are you talking about?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.880
I'm talking about the
joke you played on Dwight.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.649
I don't know how you can
feel good about winning when

19:09.749 --> 19:11.017
my buddy's out there, crushed.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.151
Crushed?

19:12.252 --> 19:13.720
You leveled that guy.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.155
Dan, I went out there
to give him every chance.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.524
He acted like a pig.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.659
I know the guy ain't
exactly Prince Charming,

19:19.759 --> 19:22.028
but every time I've needed
him, he's been there for me.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.596
He's a human being, Jackie.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.097
He's got feelings.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.699
He's right, Jackie.

19:26.799 --> 19:31.003
How could you turn down a guy
with a lime green monster?

19:31.103 --> 19:32.572
I thought you were
going to stay out of this?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.874
I did, and that's
why it's all messed up.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.076
Dan, I swear, I went out
there to give him a chance.

19:37.176 --> 19:37.977
A chance?

19:38.077 --> 19:39.779
A chance to look like a jerk?

19:39.879 --> 19:41.348
But he's so good at it.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.053
Go ahead and joke.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.721
Meanwhile, my buddy is sitting
out there, trying to scrape

19:48.821 --> 19:50.490
his pride off the driveway.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.124
Oh, Dan get off it.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.328
Honey, you didn't see the
look on that poor guy's face.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.263
He's scarred for life.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.830
He'll never get over it.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.432
Excuse me.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.067
Jackie, could you move your car?

20:01.167 --> 20:02.101
You're blocking me in.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.303
Yeah, I'll move it.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.672
I'm going to give your
friend Dwight a ride home.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.508
He's not feeling too good,
and his mother has his car.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.213
Whoa.

20:14.314 --> 20:17.750
[whistles] Catch
you later, big guy.

20:17.850 --> 20:18.651
ROSEANNE: Ahem.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.025
Guess he got over it.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.236
Listen to that.
Purring like a kitten.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.371
And it's only 10:30.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.209
Remember how we used
to go to the drive-in

20:43.310 --> 20:44.744
every Saturday night.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.447
Yeah, we put the
kids in pajamas,

20:47.547 --> 20:49.549
and then we popped
that big bag of corn,

20:49.649 --> 20:51.518
and that was really
fun, wasn't it?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.486
I can't believe they tore
down that old drive-in.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.389
And put up that incredibly
beautiful mini-mall.

20:56.489 --> 21:00.192
The kids always fall asleep
during the second feature.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.128
And we get romantic.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.129
You mean you'd get romantic.

21:03.229 --> 21:04.931
Of course I would.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.566
You'd put your head
on my shoulder,

21:06.666 --> 21:08.968
and we cuddle up real
close, and you look

21:09.068 --> 21:11.838
right up here at the screen.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.139
Can you see it?

21:13.239 --> 21:14.541
Yeah.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.743
What are they playing?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.478
"Guns of Navarone."

21:18.578 --> 21:19.812
No, I don't want
to watch that again.

21:19.912 --> 21:20.947
What'll you watch?

21:21.047 --> 21:22.782
Uh, Doctor "Zee-vay-go."

21:22.882 --> 21:26.653
[laughs] All right,
I could see that.

21:26.753 --> 21:27.620
Yeah.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.222
See the snow falling
and the train's

21:30.323 --> 21:31.391
pulling into the station.

21:31.491 --> 21:32.925
Yeah, she's there
waiting for him.

21:33.025 --> 21:33.893
Yeah.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.262
And he steps
down off the train.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.197
Their eyes meet.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.233
He walks over, he reaches
out, takes her hand.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.903
And says, how do you
like me to pop your hood?

21:44.003 --> 21:48.174
