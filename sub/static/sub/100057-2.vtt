WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:05.915
Fork Fest 2019.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.207
For a moment,
I almost forgot where I was.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.808
Still hell.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.726
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:16.784 --> 00:18.521
You honked at someone?

00:18.546 --> 00:19.851
Wow.

00:19.876 --> 00:23.109
News travels fast for a town
whose speed limit is mosey.

00:23.134 --> 00:25.414
We don't honk in Conley Fork.

00:25.439 --> 00:27.650
Unless you're trying to
scare a cow off the road.

00:27.675 --> 00:29.372
Or if your buddy's asleep at the wheel

00:29.397 --> 00:30.941
and you're trying to gently wake him up.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.531
Well, I am from New York,

00:32.566 --> 00:35.034
and honking is the least
offensive thing that I do.

00:35.059 --> 00:36.291
Come on, take your music.

00:36.316 --> 00:37.646
If I may. As a missionary,

00:37.671 --> 00:39.538
I found the quickest
way to gain acceptance

00:39.573 --> 00:41.774
is by adopting local customs.

00:41.799 --> 00:43.132
Go Wildcats!

00:47.148 --> 00:49.615
I became head of one of
the best music departments

00:49.650 --> 00:51.722
in the country without
caring about being accepted.

00:51.747 --> 00:54.053
- Why start now?
- 'Cause now you live in a small town.

00:54.086 --> 00:55.133
You're gonna need this people.

00:55.157 --> 00:57.273
And your good reputation
is your currency.

00:57.298 --> 00:58.686
Once you lose it, you can't get it back,

00:58.710 --> 00:59.982
just like your pelvic floor.

01:00.007 --> 01:02.281
Not mine. She's still sturdy.

01:02.306 --> 01:03.850
I do care about my reputation

01:03.875 --> 01:07.046
among people of intellect
and refinement...

01:07.071 --> 01:08.577
so, not here.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.678
We're sophisticated.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.546
And Fork Fest is a hotbed
of local talent.

01:12.571 --> 01:14.917
And our choir is always
a crowd favorite.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.271
We always knock their socks
off with our music selection.

01:17.296 --> 01:19.367
I mean, unless the local
Joe Cocker cover band

01:19.392 --> 01:20.589
is there, Faux Cocker.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.826
Last year, we sang a song
about God's love,

01:22.850 --> 01:25.054
MC Hammer's "You Can't Touch This."

01:25.079 --> 01:26.612
And it was awesome.

01:26.637 --> 01:29.638
Your definition of awesome
is different from mine.

01:29.663 --> 01:31.156
And yours is wrong.

01:31.181 --> 01:33.523
No, Fork Fest is awesome.

01:33.548 --> 01:35.553
We always do the pie-eating contest.

01:35.578 --> 01:38.774
But maybe not this year
because of the divorce.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.166
Oh, no, of course, we will.

01:41.343 --> 01:44.336
We're still a family,
and we all still love pie.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.037
Yeah, we sure do.

01:46.062 --> 01:49.318
I mean, I've loved pie
since ninth grade gym class.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.265
That's why I made a vow to pie.

01:51.556 --> 01:54.023
But sadly, pie gave up on me

01:54.048 --> 01:57.250
when I got pie's credit
score into the single digits.

01:57.661 --> 01:59.962
I'm also allergic to pecan.

02:00.242 --> 02:01.620
What?

02:01.645 --> 02:02.773
I get a rash...

02:02.798 --> 02:04.667
- We got it.
- Stop it. Wayne.

02:13.485 --> 02:15.219
I'm gonna feel so guilty if this divorce

02:15.244 --> 02:17.044
ruins Fork Fest for Cash.

02:17.069 --> 02:19.849
It's always just been the most
wonderful time of the year.

02:19.874 --> 02:22.461
Of course, because Christmas
lacks that irresistible

02:22.486 --> 02:25.354
combination of fried food
and animal husbandry.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.046
It's where Wayne and
I had our first kiss.

02:28.082 --> 02:29.848
We got engaged there.

02:29.873 --> 02:31.339
Cash is a Fork baby.

02:34.547 --> 02:35.788
It's unbelievable.

02:35.813 --> 02:37.382
Blocking the middle of the road.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.724
Why are you in such a rush?

02:38.759 --> 02:40.047
'Cause I'm missing...

02:41.105 --> 02:43.672
nothing, but still.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.077
This is ridiculous.

02:45.102 --> 02:47.899
Arthur, don't you dare.
We just talked about this.

02:47.924 --> 02:49.922
I'm not gonna honk the horn.

02:50.727 --> 02:51.727
Hey!

02:52.550 --> 02:54.583
People are waiting here!

02:54.608 --> 02:56.453
Are you crazy?

02:56.477 --> 02:58.355
I'm depressed since my wife just died.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.190
I'm not sure if that falls
under your definition

03:00.214 --> 03:02.514
- of mental illness.
- That's Jerry Blevins.

03:02.539 --> 03:04.026
Which one is Jerry Blevins?

03:04.051 --> 03:05.395
The one with the beard and the truck,

03:05.419 --> 03:06.916
or the one with the truck and the beard?

03:06.940 --> 03:09.188
Jerry schedules the
entertainment at Fork Fest,

03:09.213 --> 03:10.533
and if we get on his bad side,

03:10.558 --> 03:11.768
he'll give us a crummy time slot.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.244
Well, he doesn't know who I am, or
that I'm connected with the choir.

03:14.268 --> 03:15.467
No, you don't get it.

03:15.492 --> 03:16.806
Nothing goes un-talked-about here.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.864
You got the only foreign car in town,

03:18.889 --> 03:21.089
and everybody knows it
belongs to the angry Yankee

03:21.114 --> 03:22.947
who runs Second First's choir.

03:22.972 --> 03:25.766
They call us the carpetbagger choir.

03:25.791 --> 03:27.933
No, it should be
the carpetbagger and the choir.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.585
I get first billing.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.087
- Oh, finally.
- Oh, God.

03:41.381 --> 03:42.786
I told you so.

03:42.811 --> 03:45.239
Jerry gave us a time slot
up against a tractor pull.

03:45.264 --> 03:46.969
It's devastating to me

03:46.994 --> 03:49.105
that you would expect me
to know what that means.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.028
Who doesn't know what a tractor pull is?

03:51.053 --> 03:52.248
I do not...

03:55.240 --> 03:57.520
Okay, okay. I get it, I get it.

03:57.545 --> 04:00.137
It's less than ideal.

04:00.162 --> 04:01.394
Less than ideal?

04:01.419 --> 04:03.159
They're not gonna be able to hear us.

04:03.184 --> 04:05.688
My hopes of attracting hip,
young members to the church

04:05.713 --> 04:08.091
with our happening beats are dashed.

04:08.115 --> 04:10.659
When they're mad, I'm mad.
You guys are mad, right?

04:10.684 --> 04:12.028
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.223
You made it wrong
and now you gotta make it right.

04:14.248 --> 04:17.690
I'll call Jerry.
He does have a phone, doesn't he?

04:17.716 --> 04:19.267
We're not a bunch of bumpkins, Arthur.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.293
Of course, he has a phone.

04:20.317 --> 04:22.981
- He doesn't have a phone.
- Oh, my God.

04:23.489 --> 04:24.789
Arthur, this is the south.

04:24.814 --> 04:25.958
You can't just call people on the phone.

04:25.982 --> 04:27.357
You gotta meet with them face to face.

04:27.381 --> 04:29.261
If you want to make it right with Jerry,

04:29.286 --> 04:30.786
you're gonna have to do it our way.

04:30.811 --> 04:33.747
With tact and grace and elegance.

04:33.772 --> 04:35.634
Yes, make him a noodle casserole.

04:35.659 --> 04:36.659
- Ooh.
- Yes.

04:36.684 --> 04:39.049
My secret ingredient is margarine.

04:39.084 --> 04:40.762
- Margarine?
- That's what I said, margarine.

04:40.786 --> 04:42.753
- Margarine.
- Jesus.

04:47.559 --> 04:49.594
You know that girl you had
beef with in high school?

04:49.618 --> 04:50.662
- Stephanie.
- No.

04:50.696 --> 04:52.073
- Tanya?
- No.

04:52.097 --> 04:53.661
- Tall Tanya?
- No.

04:53.686 --> 04:55.609
Girl, maybe you were the problem.

04:55.634 --> 04:57.568
Oh, wait, you mean...

04:58.115 --> 04:59.226
Kimmy Bell!

04:59.251 --> 05:00.696
Ginny!

05:02.374 --> 05:05.252
I always forget you still work here.

05:05.277 --> 05:06.855
It's so nice that you
can keep some things

05:06.879 --> 05:08.089
in your life consistent.

05:08.113 --> 05:09.913
Oh, it's so kind of you to be concerned.

05:09.938 --> 05:11.537
So the divorce...

05:11.562 --> 05:13.406
what happened? Was it your fault?

05:13.431 --> 05:15.030
Was it his fault?
Was it the kid's fault?

05:15.054 --> 05:16.787
Here's your food, Kimmy.

05:16.812 --> 05:18.933
And I put some extra grits
in there for your mama

05:18.958 --> 05:20.290
and that little dog of hers

05:20.315 --> 05:22.850
she bears a striking resemblance to.

05:23.639 --> 05:25.358
Thank you.

05:26.454 --> 05:29.087
Bless your heart.

05:31.014 --> 05:33.017
Bless her farming heart.

05:33.042 --> 05:35.316
You know that's just the start, right?

05:35.341 --> 05:37.174
Fork Fest will be your first

05:37.199 --> 05:38.710
public appearance since the breakup.

05:38.735 --> 05:40.922
It's all anyone is gonna
be asking you about.

05:40.947 --> 05:42.112
I just won't answer.

05:42.137 --> 05:44.103
That's only gonna make it worse.

05:44.539 --> 05:46.884
Did you know after Keith died,

05:46.909 --> 05:49.543
a rumor went around town
that I murdered him?

05:49.568 --> 05:51.540
What? No. Really?

05:51.565 --> 05:52.864
Your dead husband Keith?

05:52.889 --> 05:54.435
I learned, as a woman,

05:54.460 --> 05:56.079
you have to control the narrative.

05:56.104 --> 05:58.525
Either you tell the story,
or people make up their own.

05:58.550 --> 06:00.451
Okay, listen,
I can't exactly tell people

06:00.476 --> 06:02.042
that he often felt like a second child,

06:02.067 --> 06:03.967
and spent our entire life savings

06:04.003 --> 06:05.993
on an idiotic business idea.

06:06.297 --> 06:07.915
Beanbag pants.

06:07.940 --> 06:09.017
What's a beanbag pant?

06:09.041 --> 06:10.307
I mean, really. Right?

06:10.342 --> 06:12.342
That's a terrible idea.

06:12.378 --> 06:13.712
But it's still the truth.

06:13.737 --> 06:16.171
So? It'll get back to Cash.

06:16.196 --> 06:18.092
And I am not saying one negative thing

06:18.117 --> 06:19.660
about his father, and that is final.

06:19.685 --> 06:21.663
Maybe you should worry
about your own reputation,

06:21.687 --> 06:23.932
'cause once it's gone,
you can't get it back.

06:23.956 --> 06:25.704
Take is from... a murderess.

06:25.729 --> 06:27.835
What, no? Nobody thinks that.

06:29.184 --> 06:30.931
We never talk about it at book club.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.933
So Cash and I are gonna
pick you up tomorrow morning

06:36.958 --> 06:38.445
for Fork Fest at 10 a.m.

06:38.470 --> 06:39.679
Okay, but don't be late.

06:39.704 --> 06:40.982
We gotta get to the ping-pong game

06:41.006 --> 06:42.422
before all the goldfish die.

06:42.447 --> 06:43.985
And just so we're on the same page,

06:44.009 --> 06:45.609
no talking about the breakup.

06:45.644 --> 06:46.988
There's gonna be a lot of people asking,

06:47.012 --> 06:48.690
and I want to be a united front.

06:48.714 --> 06:50.281
You really want to be on the safe side,

06:50.306 --> 06:51.554
why don't we stay together?

06:51.579 --> 06:54.007
Okay, okay, Jerry just pulled up.

06:54.032 --> 06:55.696
Now remember,

06:55.721 --> 06:57.799
make a personal connection with him.

06:57.823 --> 06:59.022
Yeah, but not too personal.

06:59.047 --> 07:00.390
Have fun with it. Keep it light.

07:00.415 --> 07:02.476
But don't be afraid to
play the dead wife card.

07:02.501 --> 07:04.211
In a fun, light way.

07:04.236 --> 07:05.515
Ask about his son Jason.

07:05.540 --> 07:06.863
But not his son Jalen.

07:06.888 --> 07:09.522
He moved to California,
and Jerry hates California.

07:09.547 --> 07:11.525
But he loves California Pizza Kitchen.

07:11.550 --> 07:13.420
That's an example of keeping it light.

07:15.958 --> 07:18.585
Oh, it is the guy with
the beard and the truck.

07:18.610 --> 07:21.039
And the duck said, "What,
are you kidding me?

07:21.064 --> 07:22.390
"I'm not kosher."

07:27.321 --> 07:28.852
Well, I should get going.

07:28.887 --> 07:31.298
I reckon them hogs ain't
gonna feed themselves.

07:31.323 --> 07:33.701
Well, unless they could
feed themselves the original

07:33.726 --> 07:36.775
barbecue chicken chop salad
form California Pizza Kitchen.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.414
That's my favorite salad.

07:38.439 --> 07:39.868
Hardly any vegetables.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.560
You got that right.

07:41.585 --> 07:44.118
- Oh, Jerry, this was great.
- Yeah.

07:44.343 --> 07:47.715
You know, you ain't nearly as
bad as everybody says you are.

07:47.740 --> 07:49.439
I appreciate it. Nice talking to you.

07:49.464 --> 07:51.085
- Yeah, you, too.
- Okay, buddy.

08:11.806 --> 08:13.679
Hand sanitizer? Really?

08:13.704 --> 08:15.064
Yeah, of course. Why not?

08:15.089 --> 08:16.556
You implied he was dirty.

08:16.581 --> 08:19.322
He's a hog farmer who came
here straight from work.

08:19.347 --> 08:22.082
Hand sanitizer isn't an insult.
It's a medical necessity.

08:22.107 --> 08:24.798
Everybody grosses me out,
but I was raised properly.

08:24.823 --> 08:27.287
I had a great talk with Jerry.
We laughed.

08:27.312 --> 08:29.439
We found out we had things in common.

08:29.658 --> 08:32.462
I'll bet by tonight,
we'll have an updated lineup.

08:33.453 --> 08:34.595
Oh, Jesus.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.986
We been dropped from
the lineup altogether.

08:37.011 --> 08:38.011
Wow.

08:38.037 --> 08:41.250
First time we won't be performing
in the history of our choir.

08:41.275 --> 08:45.706
- Mm, mm, mm.
- Jerry is petty in a way I...

08:45.731 --> 08:47.097
I really admire.

08:47.671 --> 08:50.477
Oh, well. That'll leave
more time for, what,

08:50.502 --> 08:51.802
potato-sack racing

08:51.827 --> 08:54.856
and pulling machinery
with other machinery.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.317
Well, if we're not performing,

08:57.342 --> 08:58.820
there's no reason for you to come.

08:58.844 --> 09:01.442
Well, I'm not gonna miss
it after this buildup.

09:01.467 --> 09:04.549
We don't want you to come to Fork Fest.

09:04.574 --> 09:06.616
Your reputation is shot in this town,

09:06.641 --> 09:09.608
and we can't afford to be
seen with you in public, so...

09:10.387 --> 09:12.434
And you're the nice one.

09:12.762 --> 09:14.269
Yeah, that's how they bullied me

09:14.293 --> 09:15.824
into being the one to tell you.

Hello, everybody,
welcome to Fork Fest 2019!

09:36.455 --> 09:40.077
This is fixing to be
the best Fork Fest yet.

09:44.410 --> 09:47.676
Now I want you to play
till the cows come home...

09:52.466 --> 09:54.746
Eat till you're as full as a tick...

09:54.951 --> 09:56.283
Hey!

09:56.319 --> 09:59.119
And celebrate till you're worn flat out.

09:59.144 --> 10:01.021
Enoch won glossiest coat!

10:01.403 --> 10:02.840
Good job, Enoch.

10:02.865 --> 10:06.895
Now coming to our main stage
is Conley Fork's most popular

10:06.920 --> 10:08.785
family clog troupe,

10:08.810 --> 10:10.775
Who Let the Clogs Out!

10:15.649 --> 10:17.148
So sorry about you and Wayne.

10:17.173 --> 10:18.639
Oh, uh...

10:18.664 --> 10:20.129
no need to be sorry.

10:20.154 --> 10:21.819
Wayne's still my best friend.

10:21.844 --> 10:24.581
He's just too great of a guy
to let out of my life that easily.

10:24.606 --> 10:25.684
So then what happened?

10:25.709 --> 10:26.878
The truth is Wayne...

10:26.903 --> 10:29.283
The truth is Wayne is
a wonderful father.

10:29.318 --> 10:30.965
- Right, Cash?
- Sure. Yeah.

10:30.990 --> 10:33.285
Girl, I remember when you
and Wayne were dating,

10:33.310 --> 10:34.799
and he wrecked your daddy's truck.

10:34.824 --> 10:37.035
I knew then he wasn't the marrying type.

10:37.059 --> 10:38.370
Well, actually, that's the night

10:38.394 --> 10:39.776
I knew I wanted to marry him.

10:39.801 --> 10:41.373
My niece's husband cheated on her...

10:41.397 --> 10:42.863
with his podiatrist.

10:42.898 --> 10:44.198
Oh, well, lucky for me,

10:44.223 --> 10:46.753
Wayne has a heart of gold,
and really great feet.

10:46.778 --> 10:48.570
I couldn't have made a
better choice for a husband.

10:48.594 --> 10:50.648
I almost named this one after him,

10:50.673 --> 10:52.872
but I didn't want him to deal
with all the Lil Wayne jokes.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.957
The way you're handling
all this is very noble,

10:56.982 --> 10:59.023
but I'm not sure he would
do the same for you,

10:59.048 --> 11:00.225
considering when you were in labor,

11:00.249 --> 11:01.590
he made you drive.

11:01.615 --> 11:03.227
Oh, he was drunk.

11:05.918 --> 11:08.199
Hey, Wayne.
I got you a hot dog on a fork.

11:08.224 --> 11:09.935
Oh, that's mighty kind of you.

11:09.959 --> 11:12.993
You can't have a hotdog on
a fork without a Forkarita.

11:13.029 --> 11:15.396
Can't say I know what I
did to deserve all this,

11:15.421 --> 11:16.737
but I like it,

11:16.762 --> 11:20.544
and I like your matching
long shirt denim things.

11:20.569 --> 11:21.893
You have a heart of gold.

11:21.918 --> 11:24.674
And the fact that Ginny didn't
see that makes her a fool.

11:24.699 --> 11:26.385
I do have a good heart, don't I?

11:26.409 --> 11:27.942
Nice pecs, too.

11:30.271 --> 11:32.523
My God, I must look hungry.

11:32.548 --> 11:34.606
Should've known that Ginny
is not the nice person

11:34.631 --> 11:36.097
she pretends to be.

11:36.122 --> 11:39.559
After all, she is friends
with that murderess.

11:39.584 --> 11:40.883
Worse...

11:40.908 --> 11:43.457
she's friends with that honking Yankee.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.598
_

11:46.623 --> 11:49.473
Don't worry, Arthur. It's open.

11:49.498 --> 11:51.198
You're lucky I'm not naked.

11:51.223 --> 11:53.177
You sure you want to be seen with me?

11:53.202 --> 11:54.768
I'm not gonna destroy your reputation?

11:54.804 --> 11:57.238
Didn't even cross my mind. Yeah.

11:57.263 --> 11:59.817
You're gonna have to spell
this town out for me.

11:59.842 --> 12:02.348
I know a noodle casserole
means I'm sorry.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.789
What does a cake with a
hungry leprechaun on it mean?

12:04.814 --> 12:06.391
It means I won this in a cakewalk,

12:06.415 --> 12:07.677
and I thought you might be hungry.

12:07.701 --> 12:09.770
No, I'm not hungry.

12:10.892 --> 12:14.824
This is Eustace Conley,
founder of Conley Fork.

12:14.849 --> 12:15.910
He's delicious.

12:15.935 --> 12:19.035
The story goes, Eustace Conley
came to a fork in the road.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.572
He was so exhausted from
his already long journey,

12:21.597 --> 12:22.810
he couldn't decide which way to go,

12:22.834 --> 12:25.676
so he did the only thing
he could think to do.

12:31.077 --> 12:33.035
- Which was?
- He turned back.

12:33.060 --> 12:35.419
Now, wouldn't you know,
when he turned 'round,

12:35.444 --> 12:38.979
he was face to face with a mean,
old black bear.

12:39.014 --> 12:41.004
Now Eustace was terrified,

12:41.029 --> 12:43.427
so he did the only thing
he could think to do.

12:43.452 --> 12:44.752
He turned back again?

12:44.777 --> 12:46.997
He put up his fists to fight.

12:47.022 --> 12:48.589
"Hey, coward," he yelled.

12:48.624 --> 12:50.792
I bet you want a piece of this.

12:50.817 --> 12:52.871
Well, wouldn't you know,
despite his bravado,

12:52.896 --> 12:55.830
the bear charged Eustace anyway.

12:55.865 --> 12:58.143
So Eustace did the only
thing he could think to do.

12:58.167 --> 12:59.366
I don't have a clue.

12:59.401 --> 13:01.468
Eustace is proving unpredictable.

13:01.504 --> 13:03.770
He laid down and played dead.

13:03.795 --> 13:07.618
The bear mauled half of him,
but kept him alive.

13:07.643 --> 13:09.973
Now on account of his horrific wounds,

13:09.998 --> 13:11.188
Eustace was unable to travel,

13:11.213 --> 13:13.949
so he did the only thing
he could think to do.

13:14.448 --> 13:19.113
He made camp in this very
place we call Conley Fork.

13:21.321 --> 13:22.973
Well, thank you for the cake.

13:22.998 --> 13:25.169
You are Eustace Conley.

13:25.194 --> 13:26.668
The bear is your bad reputation,

13:26.693 --> 13:28.372
and the choir is your little donkey.

13:28.397 --> 13:29.630
My little what?

13:29.655 --> 13:32.018
The bear ate Eustace's donkey.
Did I leave that out?

13:32.043 --> 13:34.401
Rev, I'm trying to figure out the rules,

13:34.426 --> 13:37.661
but these people have already
made up their mind about me.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.026
No matter what I do,
they're not gonna accept me.

13:40.051 --> 13:41.910
When all else fails,

13:42.278 --> 13:43.924
show that you're one of them.

13:49.926 --> 13:51.760
That's never gonna happen.

13:51.785 --> 13:55.499
Welcome to the 2019 pie-eating contest.

13:58.594 --> 14:01.172
See? We're all doing
the pie-eating contest together.

14:01.197 --> 14:02.606
Nothing's changed since last year.

14:02.631 --> 14:04.729
- Dad's wearing a shirt.
- Not by choice, buddy.

14:04.754 --> 14:06.075
- They changed the rules.
- All right...

14:06.099 --> 14:07.912
first one to finish their pie wins.

14:07.937 --> 14:10.137
No hands, no straws, no vomiting!

14:10.162 --> 14:12.020
Wayne's as dumb as he is smoking hot.

14:12.045 --> 14:14.885
I always assumed he was the one
who screwed things up with her.

14:14.910 --> 14:17.270
But she can't say enough
nice things about him.

14:17.295 --> 14:19.362
- It's guilt.
- Guilt for what?

14:19.387 --> 14:21.692
Isn't it obvious?
Ginny cheated on Wayne.

14:21.717 --> 14:23.684
Really? Is that why he left her?

14:23.719 --> 14:25.630
- They think I cheated on you?
- No...

14:25.654 --> 14:28.981
Okay, one last rule. No cheating.

14:29.006 --> 14:30.660
Did you hear that, Ginny?

14:31.218 --> 14:33.103
Now who's ready for some pie?

14:35.554 --> 14:37.356
Aren't you gonna defend me?

14:38.224 --> 14:39.932
I'm ready for some pie!

14:42.271 --> 14:43.704
Why didn't you say something?

14:43.729 --> 14:45.062
You told me not to say anything.

14:45.087 --> 14:46.582
But you know I didn't cheat on you.

14:46.607 --> 14:49.053
- I never said you did.
- Well you didn't say I didn't.

14:49.078 --> 14:50.104
- So?
- So?

14:50.129 --> 14:51.756
- Yeah, so?
- So, I look like the bad guy.

14:51.780 --> 14:52.996
- Well...
- Well, what?

14:53.021 --> 14:54.047
I'm not the one who left.

14:54.072 --> 14:55.246
What does that mean?

14:55.271 --> 14:57.403
Maybe just this once,
you are the bad guy.

15:02.658 --> 15:04.778
And we have a winner!

15:09.263 --> 15:11.675
And that's a disqualification.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.900
I guess the winner is Ginny.

15:14.925 --> 15:16.204
Whoo!

15:17.147 --> 15:18.780
Whoo-hoo!

15:18.805 --> 15:21.740
They say a leopard
doesn't change her spots.

15:21.765 --> 15:22.811
Cheater.

15:22.836 --> 15:24.639
Why are they calling you that, Mom?

15:34.609 --> 15:36.045
Where are you going?

15:36.070 --> 15:38.280
Arthur, what are you doing here?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.740
Just... I'm trying to fit
in, show I'm not a snob.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.776
Well, give up. There's no point.

15:42.801 --> 15:45.218
Once they make their mind up
about you, they'll never change it.

15:45.242 --> 15:46.928
- You okay?
- Let's just say that

15:46.953 --> 15:49.358
my reputation is more
in the mud than yours.

15:55.641 --> 15:58.905
Well sometimes you just gotta
embrace being in the mud.

15:59.503 --> 16:00.748
Make way.

16:00.773 --> 16:02.573
This Yankee wants a turn.

16:12.298 --> 16:13.701
What is happening?

16:13.726 --> 16:17.225
My pigs is giving your jerk
Yankee a run for his money.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.615
Come here. Come here.

16:24.449 --> 16:27.240
Come on, Arthur.
You got this... let's go!

16:27.767 --> 16:29.186
You got this!

16:29.512 --> 16:31.311
Go, Arthur! Go Arthur!

16:31.344 --> 16:33.428
Go, go, go... go, Arthur!

16:42.847 --> 16:45.514
Come on, Arthur... You can't quit.

16:45.902 --> 16:48.740
Why not? Eustace Conley was a quitter.

16:56.338 --> 16:57.561
Yeah!

17:02.369 --> 17:04.767
Whoohoo!

17:05.099 --> 17:07.974
Well, looks like he did it, folks.

17:11.844 --> 17:14.451
You better be laughing at this, Jean.

17:21.233 --> 17:24.201
You think I'm gonna
shake that filthy hand?

17:25.936 --> 17:29.608
Hand sanitizer's not gonna
get the smell off that, is it?

17:29.633 --> 17:30.633
No.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.748
But I respect a man who's
not afraid to get dirty.

17:35.057 --> 17:38.670
We could use an act at six,
if your group is still here.

17:41.109 --> 17:43.030
We might be able to do that.

17:47.659 --> 17:49.436
I'm happy!

Ginny never cheated on me.

18:50.317 --> 18:52.133
She'd never do that.

18:52.956 --> 18:54.414
'Cause...

18:55.003 --> 18:57.086
she's the best person I ever met.

She left me, which...

was probably the right choice,

even though my arms are so jacked,

19:05.744 --> 19:08.345
they blew the sleeves
off my shirt and...

19:08.447 --> 19:09.820
I'm super great in bed.

19:09.845 --> 19:11.378

Fork Fest wasn't half bad.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.180
Arthur helped me win this machete.

20:18.244 --> 20:19.516
This is my, uh...

20:19.541 --> 20:21.555
my third Forkarita.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.847
My judgment may be a little impaired.

20:23.872 --> 20:25.234
Uh, whoa... come on, bud.

20:25.259 --> 20:29.229
Let's go back and see
if they'll trade this in for that drone.

20:29.254 --> 20:31.430
I mean, they can't say no.
We got a machete!

20:31.455 --> 20:33.855
- Yeah!
- He had the best day.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.578
Well, of course he did.

20:35.603 --> 20:38.211
His mama won the pie-eating contest.

20:38.483 --> 20:41.000
Yeah, looking back,
those four to six hot dogs

20:41.025 --> 20:43.086
I had for breakfast were a bad idea.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.453
Ginny, I know I was
a crap husband, but...

20:49.361 --> 20:53.187
I'm gonna try not to
be a crap ex-husband.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.586
I appreciate that.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.125
I know change is not easy for you.

21:01.929 --> 21:04.062
- All right.
- What are you doing?

21:04.087 --> 21:05.758
I was going to French you.

21:05.783 --> 21:07.187
- Wayne!
- Oh.

21:07.212 --> 21:09.719
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, no... I'm sorry.

21:09.744 --> 21:11.672
- I apologize for that.
- That's disgusting.

21:11.697 --> 21:13.875
- I got caught up in the moment.
- Get out of here.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.055
- Ew, I try to be nice with you...
- Okay, God bless.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.412
And you think I wanna kiss you?

21:17.437 --> 21:19.898
What's wrong with a
little kiss between exes?

21:19.923 --> 21:23.323
