00:54.095 --> 00:57.182
Welcome back to our cozy cabin

00:57.223 --> 01:00.977

01:01.019 --> 01:03.605
You're only doing
one challenge.

01:03.646 --> 01:07.734
But it's the biggest one yet.

Big Ol' Bake.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.668
- You'll be baking
a three-tiered cake

01:24.709 --> 01:27.087
<i>inspired by Charles Dickens'
"A Christmas Carol."</i>

01:27.128 --> 01:31.132
- The beloved holiday tale
of three time-traveling ghosts

01:31.174 --> 01:32.967
who force an old man
to buy a goose

01:33.009 --> 01:35.804

01:37.472 --> 01:39.265

01:39.307 --> 01:41.768
- Another tier
will represent the present.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.604
- And the third tier
will represent your future,

01:44.646 --> 01:46.231
which could be something
you're planning

01:46.272 --> 01:50.151
or maybe it's something
that could happen

01:50.193 --> 01:51.736
in an alternate timeline.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.196
- Ooh!

01:53.238 --> 01:55.198
Multiverse stuff
is really hot right now.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.825
- It's sizzling, Maya.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.451
And because of that...
- Sizzling.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.454
- I'm thinking,
at some point, maybe we could

02:01.496 --> 02:04.457
incorporate some of that
multiversity into this show.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.334
- Look what you did there.
- Right?

02:06.376 --> 02:09.004
- So, should we get this
Big Ol' Bake started?

02:09.045 --> 02:10.171
Yeah!

02:10.213 --> 02:11.172
- You want to take this one?

02:11.214 --> 02:12.841
- Abso-tootly.

02:12.882 --> 02:17.095
Bakers, let's start those
Big Ol' Bakes.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.264
- Whoo!
- I know what to do.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.810
Could really listen
to you say that all day.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.854
- I'm gonna start
with the coconut.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.064
- Six, eight, and ten--
two of each.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.190
<i>I love a Big Ol' Bake.</i>

02:29.232 --> 02:32.068
I love doing tiered cakes.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.654
So I feel pretty good.
I feel pretty confident

02:34.696 --> 02:36.364
in what we're gonna create.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.784
I'm gonna need 2 1/2 cups
of cake flour.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.911
- What we're gonna
do is three tiers.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.122
You got the fondant,
I got the inside.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.041
- Yeah, you keep
that brooch clean.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.709
- Whoo.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.378
- We're not even married
to Big Ol' Bake as the name.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.630
It could be any number
of things, right?

02:52.672 --> 02:54.966
- Really?
- It could be Bake-tacular

02:55.008 --> 02:56.551
or Bakes-calibur.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.927
Or...
- Oh, that's not bad.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.388
- I don't know, maybe,
like, Master Bakers.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.973
- No.
- No?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.684
Just feel like it'd be--
it's catchy to me.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.852
- Please don't.
- I don't know why.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.647
Hey, Master Bakers,
get master baking!

03:09.689 --> 03:11.858
- Absolutely not.
- No, okay.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.860
- Joelle and Jordan,
you have two batters going!

03:13.902 --> 03:16.529
Yes.
- That's twin life.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.990
- We only have one chance
to impress the grannies today,

03:19.032 --> 03:20.742
<i>and we are not cake...</i>

03:20.784 --> 03:22.035
People.
- Yeah.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.912
- This is making me so...

03:23.953 --> 03:25.538
Nervous.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.290
- What are you guys making,
Gerard and Shawn?

03:27.332 --> 03:29.334
- We are making
a three-tiered cake.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.337
- Oh, okay, descriptive.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.838
- We're celebrating
more than one--

03:33.880 --> 03:35.256
- We're celebrating many,
many holidays.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.509
- More than one holiday.
- Oh, I love it.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.802
- Hello, Gerard and Shawn.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.303
- Hey.
What's up, guys?

03:40.345 --> 03:43.098
- Tell us about your bake.
- After Christmas every year,

03:43.139 --> 03:45.892
for the next seven days,
we actually celebrate

03:45.934 --> 03:48.103
an African American tradition--
Kwanzaa.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.814
We exchange gifts every day,
and for seven days,

03:50.855 --> 03:53.525
<i>we celebrate each of the seven
principles of Kwanzaa--</i>

03:55.819 --> 03:56.861
And purpose.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.866
And cooperative economics.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.786
Please don't hold me to it
if I got those out of order.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.329
And I'm not saying it
in Swahili.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.041
- Which of the principles
would you say

04:10.083 --> 04:11.584
resonate with you the most?

04:11.626 --> 04:12.877
- Unity.
- Yeah.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.879
- Cake will be colored red,
black, and green,

04:14.921 --> 04:16.798
which are the traditional
colors of Kwanzaa.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.508
<i>And there's gonna
be one coconut layer,</i>

04:18.550 --> 04:20.593
<i>representing his Caribbean background,</i>

04:20.635 --> 04:22.095
<i>a layer with pecans</i>

04:22.137 --> 04:24.597
<i>that represents
my Southern background,</i>

04:24.639 --> 04:26.808
<i>and the top layer will be rum.</i>

04:26.850 --> 04:28.226
The bottom layer will
represent the past,

04:28.268 --> 04:31.062
the struggles that we've
gone through in this country

04:31.104 --> 04:32.397
as a people.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.648
Present is gonna
be the next layer,

04:33.690 --> 04:35.859
representing everything
we're going through

04:35.900 --> 04:38.111
right now--the struggle
for equality, rights,

04:38.153 --> 04:39.154
everything like that.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.530
- Mm-hmm.
- And the green at the top

04:40.572 --> 04:41.990
is obviously our future--

04:42.032 --> 04:45.493
everything we work for,
we build for, we bake for,

04:45.535 --> 04:46.828
You know, so--
- Yeah.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.956
- Our hope is
that people learn something

04:49.998 --> 04:52.250
about what Kwanzaa is
and what it's about.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.003
It's not just a Black holiday.
It doesn't have to be.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.921
- Yeah.
- And it's something that will,

04:56.963 --> 04:58.673
you know,
help enrich every family.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.425
It's about community.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.719
Just move away from hate
and move towards love.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.429
It's just so much easier.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.972
- It's a deep cake.
- Yeah, it's a deep cake.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.849
- It's a deep cake.
- It's a very deep cake.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.100
- Right, right, right.
- But it's also delicious.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.560
So you know, let's not,
you know, sit there

05:10.602 --> 05:12.729
and cry while we eat,
you know what I'm saying?

05:12.771 --> 05:14.522
- Right, we don't want to take
away from the deliciousness.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.940
- Right, exactly.
- Right?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.359
- Exactly.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.693
- I do that when I--
when I bake.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.944
I--
- Is that what you do?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.446
You make sure it crumbles
upon touch?

05:21.488 --> 05:22.822
- Yes.
- It bunches and crumbles.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.407
- Totally.
- I could tell.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.784
- You could tell, right?
- I could tell.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.202
- Professional, professional.
- Professional.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.332
- Tom, Steve, you guys
are so quiet back here.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.875
- I know, we are.
- What's going on?

05:33.917 --> 05:38.004
<i>- I'm making a fondant bow
for the top of my gift.</i>

05:38.046 --> 05:40.799
Think I'm starting--
I'm gonna start over on this.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.135
Not good.
Can't dry it at all first.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.762
It just cracked.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.390
Fondant is something that we're
working with in this challenge

05:48.431 --> 05:50.475
that we're not accustomed
to working with.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.559
- We're not artists.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.977
- No.
- We're not cake bakers.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.104
- We are not artists.
- So we're gonna go as simple

05:54.145 --> 05:55.730
as we can,
and then we're just gonna--

05:55.772 --> 05:57.565
we're gonna ride
those three tiers.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.402
- Tom and Steve.
Yeah, Tom and Steve.

- How y'all doing today?

06:12.747 --> 06:15.709
- How you doing, Zapato?
- Zapato.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.378
- Zapato's, like,
had a flustery day.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.922
- What's flustering you today?
- Oh, well, I started with--

06:20.964 --> 06:23.591
I'm not a decorator.
I'm a baker and a cook.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.010
- Okay.
- So, you know, and I tried

06:25.051 --> 06:27.554
to make these
little fondant things

06:27.595 --> 06:31.516
for Steve's daughter,
the future Coco O'Leary.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.852
- My wife
is having my third child.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.937
- A girl.
- A little girl.

06:35.979 --> 06:39.149
- I am over the moon about
getting another granddaughter.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.109
Right now, we have six boys
and three girls.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.069
<i>I'm ready
for the fourth little girl.</i>

06:43.111 --> 06:45.071
<i>It's gonna be a joyful time
for us.</i>

06:45.113 --> 06:48.241
We both love that part
of our lives as grandparents.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.494
- So the foundation
of the cake is my mom.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.954
<i>Her favorite cake
is coconut cake.</i>

06:52.996 --> 06:55.248
<i>The center is our
present Christmas,</i>

06:55.290 --> 06:57.459
<i>and it's gonna be red velvet,
representing Santa Claus.</i>

06:57.500 --> 07:01.087
And then the top tier,
it's a birthday cake for Coco.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.048
- She's coming.
- She's coming.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.591
- Remember, we talked about...
- She'll be here between now--

07:04.632 --> 07:05.800
- He's having
another baby soon?

07:05.842 --> 07:07.761
- Yes.
- That's the concept.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.804
- How is this?
Is this fun for you?

07:09.846 --> 07:10.805
- This is great.
- Oh, yeah.

07:10.847 --> 07:11.931
- We also are pretty relaxed,

07:11.973 --> 07:13.558
'cause we're not
baking anything.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.643
How do you feel?
- We feel good.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.395
- We're enjoying
the grandmothers.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.980
<i>That's very much fun for us.</i>

07:19.022 --> 07:20.482
- You seem like you are
enjoying the grandmothers.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.941
- Yes, I really am.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.366
- I poured you
about 900 grams of those.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.575
Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.660
It's mass chaos over there.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.079
- I'm gonna do an opera cake
for the bottom.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.415
I'm gonna see
if I can use every bowl

07:37.457 --> 07:38.625
in this entire kitchen today.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.918
- Please don't.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.461
- Wow!

07:41.503 --> 07:43.922
Hey, this is so much better
than the one we have at home.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.757
- We're not finding you toys
when you get home.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.176
- I'm not a baker.
I'm someone who bakes.

07:48.218 --> 07:54.182
I've only ever encountered
three-tiered cakes at weddings.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.184
<i>That's it.
- Certainly never made one.</i>

07:56.226 --> 07:58.853
I'm worried
about it falling over or...

07:58.895 --> 08:00.188
- Yeah.
- Crashing in.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.691
- We just--we don't make
three-tiered cakes.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.067
- Jonah and Patrick, hello.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.860
- Hello.
- How are you guys doing?

08:05.902 --> 08:07.362
- We're okay.
This is a big one.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.532
- Is it a Big Ol' Bake?
- It's a Big Ol' Bake.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.783
- Is that an Irish stout?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.034
- Yeah, Irish stout.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.245
- I was just in Ireland,
and I was taught

08:15.286 --> 08:17.997
how to correctly pour that
in order to get a proper head.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.916
- Oh.
- When you open them,

08:19.958 --> 08:22.711
you're supposed to squeeze
the middle of the can,

08:22.752 --> 08:25.005
and it releases the hounds.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.297
- Wow.
- Do you want to try?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.382
- Sure.
- Okay.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.009
-
Safety.

08:29.050 --> 08:32.303
- I'm glad she didn't go
for the knives.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.097
- So you--
- Oh, God.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.432
Wardrobe.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.017
Maya, wardrobe.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.060
- This is--
- Thank you for helping, Maya.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.478
It's been really
great seeing you.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.274
- Aren't you glad I did that?
- Yes.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.358
It's...
- May I?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.193
- Spreading holiday cheer
everywhere.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.654
- So why the Irish stout?
What are you guys making?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.239
- So, we are making
a three-tiered cake,

08:51.281 --> 08:53.116
<i>holidays past, present,
and future.</i>

08:53.158 --> 08:55.410
<i>The past layer is going to be</i>

08:55.452 --> 08:56.411
<i>sort of a knockoff version</i>

08:56.453 --> 08:57.746
of an opera cake,

08:57.787 --> 08:59.581
because I used
to sing opera professionally.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.750
- Uh-huh.
- When I turned 26,

09:01.791 --> 09:03.418
I started having trouble
with my voice,

09:03.460 --> 09:06.504
and it ended up
that I needed vocal surgery,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.006
and I realized that that wasn't

09:08.048 --> 09:09.424
gonna be a viable
career option.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.676
<i>When you find out
that you can't do the thing</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:14.971
<i>that you want to do anymore,
you think you're nothing.</i>

09:15.013 --> 09:17.932
So to keep myself busy
and to keep myself sane,

09:17.974 --> 09:19.559
I started cooking
and baking every day.

09:19.601 --> 09:23.146
And then the middle tier
is going to be what, Patrick?

09:23.188 --> 09:26.358
- It's gonna be
a chocolate Irish stout cake,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.026
which is representative
of my family.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.528
We often will toast to those
who are not here with us.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.780
Something that...
- Lovely.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.157
- We'd often use to toast
is a Irish stout.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.951
- And top layer is gonna
be a knockoff of tres leches,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.620
'cause ever since we moved
to the Bronx, actually,

09:38.661 --> 09:40.830
our neighbors, Diana and Diana,

09:40.872 --> 09:42.457
give us a tres leches cake
at Christmas.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.293
- Which one's Diana?
- I still don't know, actually.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.045
If you would like...

09:47.087 --> 09:50.423
- I mean, I'm not gonna say no.
-

09:50.465 --> 09:52.217
-
- Cheers.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.136
- Ah, tastes like high school.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.973
- Andy, you're really
into this multiverse stuff.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.975
- Yeah, I know,
but it's in every movie

10:01.017 --> 10:02.811
and TV show right now,
and I watch 'em all.

10:02.852 --> 10:06.064
But the weird thing is there's
another universe where I don't.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.857
- Yeah, that's pretty crazy
to think about.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.609
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, who would we be

10:09.651 --> 10:10.902
in another universe?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.404
Would we even know each other?

10:12.445 --> 10:15.990
- I--I don't know.
I mean, would we wear scarves?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.909
What kind of hand gestures
would we do?

10:17.951 --> 10:20.120
- Gosh, I guess
there's no way to know.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.664
- Yeah.
It's cool to think about.

- The butter?

10:47.981 --> 10:50.150
No, I would beat it
a little bit longer.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.092

Okay, that's in.
That's good.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.860
- Jessica and Stephanie, hi.
- Hi!

11:33.902 --> 11:36.237
- What's that?
- This is meringue.

11:36.279 --> 11:39.491
So we're gonna make some
little meringue mushrooms.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.700
- Beautiful.
- And then also turn it

11:40.742 --> 11:42.327
into buttercream.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.079
- What makes a meringue
a meringue, egg white?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.247
- Yeah.
So this is a Swiss meringue,

11:46.289 --> 11:48.208
so you cook the egg whites
in sugar,

11:48.249 --> 11:51.002
dissolve them on the stove,
and then you whip it up.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.545
Um, you can do
a French meringue.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.089
Italian meringue
is with a sugar syrup,

11:54.130 --> 11:56.633
French meringue is
just sprinkling in sugar.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.677
So there's lots of different
ways that you can do it.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.095
- Let's hear about your cake.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.138
- When we were little kids,
we used to dance

12:02.180 --> 12:04.015
in "The Nutcracker" ballet
together.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.558
<i>- Oh.
- Yeah.</i>

12:05.600 --> 12:08.520
<i>So we decided we're gonna
make a "Nutcracker" cake.</i>

12:10.980 --> 12:14.025
<i>We're gonna incorporate a lot
of nut flavors into that.</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:15.568
- We're not fondant artists,

12:15.610 --> 12:18.363
but we are trying to make
a Nutcracker little face.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.572
- A little face on there.
- Ah.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.117
- And then--
- You're not fond of fondant?

12:22.158 --> 12:24.035
- I don't like to eat it.
- Nice, Dad.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.162
- Mm-hmm.
-

12:26.204 --> 12:28.748
- We are really relying
on this Nutcracker face.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.543
That's our whole
Christmas past.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.503
- Right, if we can't
get the face on the Nutcracker,

12:33.545 --> 12:35.797
that cake isn't
gonna make any sense.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.799
- She was, like,
prima ballerina.

12:37.841 --> 12:38.883
- No.
- Like Clara,

12:38.925 --> 12:40.301
<i>the star of "The Nutcracker."</i>

12:40.343 --> 12:43.513
I was, like,
the most pigeon-toed.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.849
Like, my mom went to
the doctor, and they were like,

12:45.890 --> 12:48.101
"You're either gonna have to
break her hips and put them--

12:48.143 --> 12:49.769
"put her in those,
like, leg braces,

12:49.811 --> 12:51.646
or maybe try ballet."

12:51.688 --> 12:53.940
- Those were the two options?
- Yeah.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.567
- So I'm assuming
you chose ballet?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.110
- I'm going ballet
ten out of ten times.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.611
- Who--I'm just curious
which family's like,

12:58.653 --> 12:59.487
let's break your hips.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.614
- Right, right.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.909
- So pigeon-toed,
every photo of me is like this.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.536
<i>But that taught me a lot,</i>

13:06.578 --> 13:08.246
<i>that you can work
through physical ailments.</i>

13:08.288 --> 13:11.166
And later,
in junior high school,

13:11.207 --> 13:13.501
<i>I was diagnosed
with scoliosis,</i>

13:13.543 --> 13:16.212
<i>and so I had
to wear a back brace.</i>

13:16.254 --> 13:18.381
Junior high school
is hard anyway.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.593
Glasses, braces, frizzy hair.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.637
<i>And so it was
a tough experience.</i>

13:24.679 --> 13:28.266
But it taught me to just,
like--just own it.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.727
It's fun, because we had
one dance together.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.520
- Want to do it?
- Oh, yes.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.451
- Anyway.
- Aww.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.203
- Beautiful.
- I do love that.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.455
'Cause it's the girls holding
their dolls like babies.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.582
- Yeah, it's really sweet.
- Aww.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.126
- What would
be your three-tiered cake,

13:55.168 --> 13:56.378
past, present, future?

13:56.419 --> 13:59.297
- Past is, like, Shakespeare.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.466
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, like the thea-tah.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.052
- Yeah, pounding the boards.
- Pounding the boards.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.345
- Mm-hmm, sure.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.222
- And then present
would be like, I'm a mom.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.724
I got a cool family, you know.
- Mm-hmm.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.060
- And the future
would just be like...

14:12.102 --> 14:14.813
like a ton of plastic surgery.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.442
- That is beautiful.
Good job on that.

14:19.484 --> 14:20.694
- Yeah.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.781
- I want to eat all
these undressed, naked cakes.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.494
- The crumb coat turned out
pretty good.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.287
- Cinnamon is just Christmas
to me.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.747
As soon as I smell cinnamon,

14:32.789 --> 14:36.251
I know it is sometime
after November in the year,

14:36.292 --> 14:38.336
and it just--
it's such a warm flavor.

14:39.421 --> 14:40.505
- Hey, Joelle and Jordan.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.007
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you all?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.508
- Oh, I'm just gonna...

14:43.550 --> 14:45.051
put that down.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.970
- Oh, you got a knuckle rester.
- Wow.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.513
- Oh, yeah,
I guess I did get one.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.348
Yeah, pretty cool.
- Oh, you found one.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.891
- I feel very,
very comfortable.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.643
- Yes.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.520
- Don't let me distract you.
- You should trademark it.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.689
- Bet I could make tens
of dollars.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.899
Yes, yeah.
- Well, hey, you never know.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.068
- Switched, I switched,
and it's just as comfy.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.070
- I'm happy for you.
- Anyway, we're not here

15:04.112 --> 15:05.822
to talk about my new,
great invention

15:05.864 --> 15:06.865
that I'm gonna make tens on.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.408
- We're not?
- No, we want to know

15:08.450 --> 15:09.576
about your wonderful bake.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.494
- We're going past,
present, future.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.288
- We're very--yeah.
- So bottom, middle, top.

15:13.329 --> 15:17.250
And the bottom layer
represents our abuela,

15:17.292 --> 15:20.795
who made a coconut cinnamon
custard for my dad

15:20.837 --> 15:22.881
and his six siblings
when they were growing up.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.551
- Where is your abuela from?
- She's from Puerto Rico.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.054
So we are replicating
that a little bit

15:29.095 --> 15:31.056
with the flavors
in our bottom tier.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.183
<i>And then our middle tier
is our Christmas present.</i>

15:33.224 --> 15:37.228
<i>- We're doing a vanilla almond
cake with a raspberry filling.</i>

15:37.270 --> 15:38.813
<i>And for our future tier cake,</i>

15:38.855 --> 15:42.317
<i>we have a vanilla cake with
a cookies and cream filling</i>

15:42.359 --> 15:43.902
<i>that is decorated
like the world</i>

15:43.943 --> 15:46.613
<i>with a heart and peace sign
made out of candy melts.</i>

15:46.654 --> 15:49.074
- We actually do a lot
of community service work.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.909
We have our own nonprofit.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.036
- You have your own nonprofit?
We do.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.621
- With two of our friends.
- Two of our best friends.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.332
- What's it called?
4 Little Souls, Inc.

15:57.374 --> 16:00.460
- Baking has been a big part
of our community service.

16:00.502 --> 16:04.172
<i>We've done full
baking fundraisers for schools</i>

16:04.214 --> 16:05.590
to provide them
with technology.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.134
- The smallest acts
go such a long way,

16:08.176 --> 16:10.345
and if we all just
do a little bit,

16:10.387 --> 16:12.097
everybody can do their part.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.348
- Absolutely.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.933
- So hopefully at Christmas,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.393
at some point in our lives,

16:16.434 --> 16:18.186
maybe even
in the next lifetime,

16:18.228 --> 16:21.022
we will see world peace,
world hunger,

16:21.064 --> 16:22.440
all that kind of come together.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.984
- That's awesome.
Thank you.

16:25.026 --> 16:28.113
- They're very inspirational
and quite adorable.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.614
- Speaking of inspiration,

16:29.656 --> 16:31.574
how do you think they felt
about my knuckle pillow?

16:31.616 --> 16:33.368
- Not only did they love it,

16:33.410 --> 16:35.704
but I think they're going
to become investors.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.207

16:50.885 --> 16:52.971

- Oh, hello, Andy.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.473

16:57.600 --> 16:59.519
- I'm not named

The thing is we don't
have quite as much room

we were going to have.

that's where the ornaments

- Hello, Sharon and Mike.

22:18.463 --> 22:19.839
- Hey, y'all.
- Hi.

22:23.927 --> 22:26.179
Past, present,

22:26.221 --> 22:28.056
- Yeah.
So we are from the South,

22:28.098 --> 22:31.601
so our Southern roots
run pretty deep,

22:31.643 --> 22:35.271
and red velvet
is certainly a staple.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.857
<i>What we're planning to do
for our Christmas past</i>

22:37.899 --> 22:40.610

<i>we're gonna do
the coconut cream cake</i>

22:45.115 --> 22:47.117

22:47.158 --> 22:50.370
Our future is the coconut cake,

22:50.412 --> 22:52.455
and we did that
because we're in the South,

22:52.497 --> 22:54.916
and we always dream of a white
Christmas, and we never get it.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.543
So we keep hoping every year.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.670
So in the future, maybe we'll
have a white Christmas.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.422
- That sounds lovely.
What would you say

23:00.463 --> 23:02.924
you love most about the South?

23:02.966 --> 23:05.093
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, wow.

23:05.135 --> 23:10.223
- I think the slower...
the slower, um, pace.

23:10.265 --> 23:13.309
Well, I used to own a bakery
in Georgia.

23:13.351 --> 23:14.894
<i>Absolutely loved it,</i>

23:14.936 --> 23:17.355
<i>but with that
came a lot of stress,</i>

23:17.397 --> 23:20.025
and we chose for me
to walk away from that

23:20.066 --> 23:24.195
so that I would feel better
physically and mentally.

23:24.237 --> 23:27.115
<i>But I knew that I still would
want to dabble in it,</i>

23:27.157 --> 23:30.410
so we are so excited
to be a part of "Baking It."

23:30.452 --> 23:32.662
- The time I've spent there,
my favorite thing,

23:32.704 --> 23:34.205
probably the honey bourbon.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.790
- The honey bourbon?
- Yeah.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.375
- What part of the South?

23:37.417 --> 23:38.585
- Texas.
- Texas?

23:38.626 --> 23:41.463
We don't really consider
Texas the South.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.048
- Oh.
- Really?

23:43.089 --> 23:44.674
- No, not where we're from.
- Texas--Texas is Texas.

23:44.716 --> 23:45.884
- Texas is on its own.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.969
- Texas is just Texas?
- Exactly.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.804
I'm from the Bay Area,

23:49.846 --> 23:51.097
so I consider
Los Angeles the South.

from my mother.

Surprise.

get too handsy with you.

35:59.117 --> 36:01.703
Okay, Jessica and Stephanie,
please bring us your bake.

36:01.745 --> 36:04.497
- Wow.
- Oh, my, oh, my.

36:04.539 --> 36:07.375
<i>- Jessica and I used to dance
in "The Nutcracker."</i>

36:07.417 --> 36:11.087
<i>It was such a special memory,
and every time I ever hear,</i>

36:11.129 --> 36:13.882
you know, "The Nutcracker"
songs at Christmastime,

36:13.923 --> 36:15.050
it just takes me right back.

36:15.091 --> 36:17.302
- Very nice.
Very, very nice.

36:17.344 --> 36:20.764
- The layers are all
perfectly done and even.

36:20.805 --> 36:22.057
I love the Nutcracker.

36:22.098 --> 36:25.101
I think the execution is
what is really startling.

36:25.143 --> 36:27.562
The mustache--
I mean, it's--

36:27.604 --> 36:29.564
it's so spot-on,
don't you think, girls?

36:29.606 --> 36:31.733
- And I love that hair.

36:31.775 --> 36:34.319
I mean, that pipping
on that is stunning.

36:35.612 --> 36:37.989
- Christmas past
is a devil's food cake

36:38.031 --> 36:42.410
with a hazelnut buttercream
and chopped roasted hazelnuts.

36:42.452 --> 36:45.372
- Christmas present
is a lemon poppy seed.

36:45.413 --> 36:48.792
- The one with the stripe
is devil's food cake

36:48.833 --> 36:51.920
with a salted caramel
Swiss meringue buttercream.

36:51.961 --> 36:53.755
- It's delicious.
I mean, it's moist.

36:53.797 --> 36:55.632
The crumb is magnificent.

36:55.674 --> 36:57.258
- Oh, thank you so much.

36:57.300 --> 37:00.345
- The lemon poppy seed--

37:00.387 --> 37:01.888
right on, right on.

37:01.930 --> 37:05.934
So good.
- Each one is different,

37:05.975 --> 37:08.937
but each one
is equally delicious.

37:08.978 --> 37:11.606
- Pretty on the inside,
and beautiful on the outside.

37:13.983 --> 37:16.861
- Joelle and Jordan,
please bring up your bake.

37:16.903 --> 37:18.947
- Okay...
- So we have

37:18.988 --> 37:20.907
<i>a three-tier cake here
that is representative</i>

37:20.949 --> 37:23.535
<i>of our past, present,
and future.</i>

37:23.576 --> 37:25.120
It's our world of Christmas.

37:25.161 --> 37:27.664
The bottom tier
is a cinnamon cake

37:27.706 --> 37:29.290
<i>with a coconut buttercream.</i>

37:29.332 --> 37:32.293
The second tier represents
our Christmas present.

37:32.335 --> 37:35.005
And we collect ornaments
from all over the world.

37:35.046 --> 37:37.590
So we have an
almond vanilla-flavored cake

37:37.632 --> 37:38.967
with a raspberry jam.

37:39.009 --> 37:41.094
And our top tier
is our Christmas future.

37:41.136 --> 37:43.471
It is a world
with a peace and a heart.

37:43.513 --> 37:46.349
That's what we hope that the
future will bring eventually.

37:46.391 --> 37:48.435
- Sweet.
- Lovely.

37:48.476 --> 37:51.187
- Well, I'll tell you, it's a
very pretty and colorful cake.

37:51.229 --> 37:52.272
- Thank you.

37:52.313 --> 37:53.857
- I love the ornaments
that you did,

37:53.898 --> 37:55.692
and that little flag
is such a nice touch.

37:55.734 --> 37:57.152
- Thank you.
- However,

37:57.193 --> 38:01.156
your tiers are not
very balanced.

38:01.197 --> 38:03.408
- Yeah.

38:03.450 --> 38:06.953
- Ooh, I get all the goodies
in the middle.

38:06.995 --> 38:08.455
The textures are really
interesting and different.

38:08.496 --> 38:10.623
Yes.
- This one I think is a little

38:10.665 --> 38:11.833
on the dry side,
but that could be me.

38:11.875 --> 38:13.877
I don't know.
The icings are delicious.

38:13.918 --> 38:16.713
- The flavor is there,
but it's too coarse.

38:16.755 --> 38:17.881
- Mm.
- Okay, okay.

38:17.922 --> 38:19.424
- And I'm sorry
I have to say that.

38:19.466 --> 38:20.717
- That's okay.

38:20.759 --> 38:24.095
- But I'm still eating it.

38:24.137 --> 38:28.058
- Niyati and Abhi, please
bring us your three-tier cake.

38:28.099 --> 38:29.142
- Ooh.

38:32.479 --> 38:33.938
- The bottom is past.

38:33.980 --> 38:37.108
It's a traditional Indian
pistachio cake, which is green.

38:37.150 --> 38:40.737
<i>- The middle is present--
rose and grapefruit.</i>

38:40.779 --> 38:44.032
<i>- Future is a vanilla sponge
cake with vanilla frosting,</i>

38:44.074 --> 38:46.701
since we're planning
on starting a family together.

38:46.743 --> 38:48.787
- Aww.
- It's a very pretty cake.

38:48.828 --> 38:50.997
- Thank you.

38:51.039 --> 38:52.624
- And go.
- Okay.

38:52.665 --> 38:54.459
- See who can finish first.

38:56.127 --> 38:58.380
- My favorite layer
is the pistachio,

38:58.421 --> 38:59.881
'cause I love pistachios.

38:59.923 --> 39:01.966
- You can really
taste the rose.

39:02.008 --> 39:04.094
It's not too overpowering,

39:04.135 --> 39:06.346
but you can actually really
still taste it.

39:06.388 --> 39:08.890
It's still pleasant.
- Delicious flavors.

39:08.932 --> 39:11.226
The--
and I love the colors.

39:11.267 --> 39:13.144
<i>The only thing I'm going
to say is that,</i>

39:13.186 --> 39:15.897
you see, the thickness
of this particular fondant

39:15.939 --> 39:18.233
on this layer is much thicker

39:18.274 --> 39:21.361
than the fondant
on your rose layer.

39:21.403 --> 39:22.696
The thicker the fondant,

39:22.737 --> 39:24.614
the more evil it's going
to become,

39:24.656 --> 39:27.075
because it's heavy, and it can
weigh your cake down.

39:27.117 --> 39:29.035
- I have to say it's
a good thing I'm not a judge,

39:29.077 --> 39:31.746
'cause I'm just like,
I just want the fondant.

39:44.467 --> 39:48.179
- All right, Gerard and Shawn,
please bring up your bake.

39:48.221 --> 39:50.598
<i>- So pretty.
- Oh.</i>

39:50.640 --> 39:52.851
<i>- Our favorite holiday
is Christmas,</i>

39:52.892 --> 39:55.520
which you can see represented
by the red and green.

39:55.562 --> 39:59.190
But the black represents
a whole different celebration,

39:59.232 --> 40:01.192
okay, and that celebration
is Kwanzaa.

40:01.234 --> 40:03.236
- Yeah, exactly.
- All right.

40:03.278 --> 40:05.905
The bottom layer
is coconut-flavored cake.

40:05.947 --> 40:07.782
- Oh, wow, that looks tasty.

40:07.824 --> 40:11.244
<i>- The next layer is blackberry
preserves and pecans.</i>

40:11.286 --> 40:14.539
And the top is representative
of both of us.

40:14.581 --> 40:18.209
It's a rum flavor, all right?
- If you like a little taste.

40:18.251 --> 40:20.378
-
This cake is delicious.

40:21.921 --> 40:26.092
- The flavors are terrific,
but I find the cakes dense.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.469
- Dense.
- Mm-hmm.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.137
- I'm noticing also,
on the white cake--

40:29.179 --> 40:31.264
is your crust is very tough.

40:31.306 --> 40:33.808
Did you leave it in the oven
perhaps a bit longer

40:33.850 --> 40:35.060
than you might have wanted?

40:35.101 --> 40:36.728
- A little bit longer.

40:36.770 --> 40:40.106
- But the colors are beautiful,
the tastes are lovely.

40:40.148 --> 40:42.275
- Thank you.
- I love the pecans though.

40:42.317 --> 40:43.777
- Thank you.
Thank you.

40:43.818 --> 40:49.491
- The story, the flavor,
the execution were all good.

40:49.532 --> 40:51.284
<i>- Sharon and Mike.
- Oh, wow.</i>

40:51.326 --> 40:53.661
<i>- Oh, my.
- It's beautiful.</i>

40:53.703 --> 40:55.538
- I call dibs on that elf.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.624
- Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:57.665 --> 40:59.584
- If you guys want, like,
a leg or something...

40:59.626 --> 41:01.127
- You called it first.
You can have it.

41:01.169 --> 41:03.630
- What Andy doesn't know is
he's getting paid in fondant.

41:03.672 --> 41:06.174
Just let him--
just let him have it.

41:08.343 --> 41:09.260
- Oh, my.

41:09.302 --> 41:12.847
- Our past flavor
is red velvet.

41:12.889 --> 41:14.307
- Mm.
- The present,

41:14.349 --> 41:16.184
we have stuffed French toast.

41:16.226 --> 41:18.478
- Oh, my goodness.

41:18.520 --> 41:22.440
- And then down below,
we have a coconut cake.

41:22.482 --> 41:26.903
- Your strawberry compote,
it's absolutely gorgeous.

41:26.945 --> 41:28.113
- Thank you so much.

41:28.154 --> 41:30.156
- I don't taste
the French toast though.

41:30.198 --> 41:32.367
But, I mean, doesn't mean
I don't like it though.

41:32.409 --> 41:34.160
- When you say French toast,

41:34.202 --> 41:37.163
I want to see it
when I bite into the cake.

41:37.205 --> 41:38.456
That's all.
- Yes, ma'am.

41:38.498 --> 41:40.208
- Yeah, because if you
hadn't said French toast,

41:40.250 --> 41:41.292
I wouldn't have known.

41:41.334 --> 41:42.627
- Okay.
- All I would have known

41:42.669 --> 41:44.504
is freaking delicious.

41:44.546 --> 41:46.631
Okay?
- Well, I'll take that.

41:50.677 --> 41:55.640
- Bakers, big congrats
on your first Big Ol' Bake.

41:55.682 --> 41:59.019
Now, our grannies have had a
big ol' think about your cakes,

41:59.060 --> 42:00.603
and it's time to find out
which ones

42:00.645 --> 42:03.523

out of them.

42:03.565 --> 42:04.774
- Oh, nice.

42:04.816 --> 42:07.944
And which cakes
didn't quite <i>stack up.</i>

42:07.986 --> 42:09.362
- Ooh!
- Right?

42:09.404 --> 42:12.824
- So, Grannies, which
of these cakes was top tier?

42:12.866 --> 42:17.370
- Bakers, you represented
the past, the present,

42:17.412 --> 42:19.414
and the future wonderfully.

42:19.456 --> 42:23.835
But there can only be one

43:26.773 --> 43:29.317
Let's make snow angels.
-

43:29.359 --> 43:31.736
- I wish I were just
hallucinating this,

43:31.778 --> 43:34.197
but we have to send
one of our bakers

43:34.239 --> 43:35.490
out of the snow globe.

43:35.532 --> 43:37.283
- Norma?

43:37.325 --> 43:38.993
- Well,
this is a difficult decision,

43:39.035 --> 43:40.245
because you're all
so wonderful,

43:40.286 --> 43:42.622
and you've done
such extraordinary work.

43:42.664 --> 43:45.458
But unfortunately,
leaving us are...

43:49.004 --> 43:52.298
Jordan and Joelle.

43:52.340 --> 43:53.883
We are so sorry, but you know,

43:53.925 --> 43:57.220
<i>the proportions on your cake
just did you in.</i>

43:57.262 --> 43:59.431
<i>It wasn't balanced.</i>

43:59.472 --> 44:01.516
I know this is hard
for you to hear,

44:01.558 --> 44:04.436
but the funny thing about life
is you learn far more

44:04.477 --> 44:06.354
from your failures
than your successes.

44:06.396 --> 44:08.606
We know that
you'll take these lessons

44:08.648 --> 44:10.400
and you'll pass it on
to everyone

44:10.442 --> 44:12.944
