WEBVTT

00:00.980 --> 00:02.515
Okay, people. I need you to focus.

00:02.516 --> 00:03.920
This is a critical birthday decision.

00:04.705 --> 00:05.878
Traditional.

00:07.963 --> 00:10.395
- Tiara.
- Oh...

00:12.234 --> 00:14.054
Or my personal favorite...

00:14.055 --> 00:15.686
Viking warrior princess?

00:16.027 --> 00:18.417
- Oh!
- All: Warrior princess!

00:19.437 --> 00:20.891
Oh, and also, can we please vote

00:20.892 --> 00:22.413
on whether or not we're getting a pony?

00:22.414 --> 00:23.940
I still think we can
fit one in the elevator.

00:24.447 --> 00:25.521
<i>(Door opens)</i>

00:25.522 --> 00:27.357
Well, I measured.

00:27.678 --> 00:30.585
And we can totally fit
a pony in that elevator.

00:30.586 --> 00:33.468
- Yes! Yup, knew it.
- Bonnie: Yeah.

00:33.469 --> 00:38.663
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
is already Emma's first birthday.

00:39.328 --> 00:42.452
I remember I pulled out
all the stops for you boys.

00:42.453 --> 00:45.869
Really? Because I pulled out
all our old birthday DVDs.

00:46.255 --> 00:49.207
- You care to explain this?
- (Laughter)

00:49.854 --> 00:52.002
Okay, Ray, let's try
to make this fast, okay?

00:52.003 --> 00:54.159
I've got a hangover bigger than my hair.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.037
And I cannot get that
Vanilla Ice out of my brain.

00:57.038 --> 00:59.712
Man, that guy is gonna be big, huh?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.774
<i>Hey, Ray. Ray! Hey!</i>

01:02.775 --> 01:04.430
Honey, we're over here.

01:04.825 --> 01:09.219
Danny. Danny, I told you
not to eat this, okay?

01:09.220 --> 01:11.295
Oh, you know what?
Benji... he'll never notice.

01:11.296 --> 01:12.730
- Okay, here we go.
- (Fusses)

01:12.731 --> 01:14.767
All right, all right, let's
get this over with, people.

01:14.768 --> 01:16.218
"The Cosby Show" is gonna be on.

01:16.219 --> 01:19.036
Man, and look, that Rudy...
that girl is gonna be big!

01:19.037 --> 01:21.135
Okay, blah-da blah blah blah blah.

01:21.136 --> 01:23.848
Here we go and happy...

01:23.849 --> 01:26.738
<i>- (whistle tweets)
- Bonnie: Come on, Danny! Crush him!</i>

01:26.739 --> 01:28.910
I can't believe you taped
over my first birthday.

01:29.323 --> 01:32.842
Yeah, well, since you're onto me,
I also taped over your next three.

01:33.264 --> 01:35.989
Well, unlike me, Emma's gonna
have the best birthday party ever.

01:35.990 --> 01:38.060
- We are gonna make some memories.
- Yeah.

01:38.061 --> 01:41.208
<i>(Bonnie, seductively) Come
on, Ray. Everyone's doing it.</i>

01:41.209 --> 01:43.882

- (Laughs)
- Don't worry, Emma.

01:58.069 --> 01:59.618
You're gonna have the best birthday ever,

01:59.619 --> 02:03.272
because we're having it at Frankie
& Bobbie's ice cream parlor.

02:03.273 --> 02:05.603
- Oh!
- Wait, so you're not even

02:05.604 --> 02:07.835
gonna acknowledge my petting zoo idea?

02:08.631 --> 02:11.026
That's where we had all our
special events growing up.

02:11.027 --> 02:12.870
Yeah, Ben and I worked
there in high school...

02:13.360 --> 02:15.019
Till Ben got banned...

02:16.107 --> 02:17.339
For life.

02:18.092 --> 02:21.695
(Chuckles) Okay, Ben, you've
been banned from the mall,

02:21.696 --> 02:25.109
six bars and the Statue of Liberty crown.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.565
How do you get banned
from an ice cream parlor?

02:35.035 --> 02:36.318
Hey, Ben. (Chuckles)

02:36.319 --> 02:38.731
God, this hat makes me
look like such a dork.

02:39.032 --> 02:42.265
- I hate it.
- You always say that.

02:42.266 --> 02:44.920
Can't you just enjoy the
positive side to this job?

02:44.921 --> 02:47.428
(Inhales deeply) One free sundae per shift.

02:47.769 --> 02:50.410
I'm calling this one "the kitchen sink."

02:51.098 --> 02:53.164
And I'm calling this one "boobs."

02:53.165 --> 02:55.272
Get it? Boobs.

02:57.362 --> 02:58.889
Hey, you have a little something right...

02:58.890 --> 03:00.760
oh, no no, that's my new 'stache.

03:00.761 --> 03:03.328
You like it? I've been
working on it all summer.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.889
<i>- You look so mature.

03:06.317 --> 03:08.170
<i>- (Bell jingles)
- Hey, Riles.</i>

03:08.171 --> 03:10.236
Looking pretty styling in that uniform.

03:10.237 --> 03:12.801
- Thanks.
- Ben, you look like a dork.

03:13.345 --> 03:15.135
It's the hat.

03:15.136 --> 03:18.097
No, I'm pretty sure
it's the face. (Chuckles)

03:19.666 --> 03:23.139
Hey, Ben-Ben, isn't it time for our break?

03:23.140 --> 03:24.410
He just got here.

03:24.753 --> 03:26.823
You've been on a break
since your last break.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.563
Well, when your dad
owns an ice cream parlor,

03:29.564 --> 03:31.424
you can tell me what to do.

03:31.425 --> 03:33.582
It's okay. We're just taking inventory...

03:34.621 --> 03:37.550
In my pants. Cover for me.

03:39.991 --> 03:41.991
(Exasperated sigh) I hate
having a shift with Jenny.

03:41.992 --> 03:44.236
You know, she thinks she can
just get away with anything.

03:44.237 --> 03:46.700
All I do is just work work work.

03:47.931 --> 03:51.458
Perrin! Stop eating the profits.

03:52.245 --> 03:53.969
Where is everybody? Where's Jenny?

03:54.417 --> 03:57.179
Oh, I'm not sure.

03:57.180 --> 03:58.877
I think they might be in the back.

03:58.878 --> 04:00.649
They said something about inventory...?

04:05.502 --> 04:07.552
So, we're going to the movies tonight.

04:07.553 --> 04:09.902
- I was thinking maybe you and I could...
- No thanks, I can't.

04:09.903 --> 04:12.776
I have to work a double.
Ooh, second sundae.

04:13.845 --> 04:16.396
<i>- (Clattering)
- Frankie: What the... I warned you, Wheeler!</i>

04:16.397 --> 04:17.841
<i>Now get out!</i>

04:21.077 --> 04:22.116
<i>(Bell jingles)</i>

04:22.419 --> 04:23.915
Jenny DeLuca.

04:23.916 --> 04:26.121
That girl was two scoops of awesome.

04:27.605 --> 04:28.950
I hated that girl.

04:28.951 --> 04:31.601
She's the one who instituted
the one sundae per shift rule.

04:32.448 --> 04:33.422
(Chuckles) Well, we gotta kick

04:33.423 --> 04:34.901
this Emma party plan into high gear.

04:34.902 --> 04:36.653
Riley, you're in charge of decorations;

04:36.654 --> 04:38.069
Tucker, food and beverages;

04:38.070 --> 04:40.308
- and Danny...
- Just name it. I'll do anything.

04:40.309 --> 04:42.593
- Will you be the clown?
- Anything but that!

04:43.590 --> 04:45.317
You know clowns freak me out!

04:45.318 --> 04:46.883
I can never tell if they're gonna squirt me

04:46.884 --> 04:49.429
with a flower or stab me in my sleep.

04:49.986 --> 04:52.345
The only thing a clown will stab you with

04:52.346 --> 04:54.067
is joy and merriment.

04:54.725 --> 04:57.174
Don't worry, big guy. You're in good hands.

04:57.175 --> 04:59.824
I may have dabbled in mimery in college.

05:01.443 --> 05:03.274
(Sputters) Mimes freak me out.

05:04.413 --> 05:06.032
Mom, come with me to Frankie & Bobbie's.

05:06.033 --> 05:07.682
Wait, you still wanna have it there?

05:07.683 --> 05:09.777
I mean, don't you remember
what Frankie said to you?

05:09.778 --> 05:11.142
<i>- Uh-uh.
- Ben: It doesn't matter.</i>

05:11.143 --> 05:12.673
<i>It's all water under the bridge.</i>

05:12.674 --> 05:13.988
No, what he said was,

05:13.989 --> 05:15.599
"I'll bury you under the bridge."

05:16.000 --> 05:17.150
(Thuds)

05:18.008 --> 05:19.300
<i>(Bell jingles)</i>

05:19.799 --> 05:22.167
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

05:22.168 --> 05:23.684
This place looks exactly the same.

05:24.273 --> 05:26.919
Well, you're wearing
pants, so that's different.

05:30.062 --> 05:33.155
- Ben Wheeler?
- Jenny DeLuca?

05:33.156 --> 05:35.082
Oh, my God, you look amazing.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.859
What the hell are you doing here?

05:36.860 --> 05:40.364
Well, well, well, look who's here!

05:40.365 --> 05:42.135
I didn't know it was garbage day.

05:44.182 --> 05:46.686
That pony's looking pretty
good right now, isn't it?

05:48.799 --> 05:52.173
(Laughs) Honestly, I can watch
you smash that cake all day.

05:52.174 --> 05:53.806
All right, get that backup cake ready!

05:53.807 --> 05:55.832
He's tearing through this one pretty fast!

05:56.301 --> 05:58.069
Yeah!

05:58.070 --> 05:59.703
I love cake.

05:59.704 --> 06:01.279
Happy Birthday, Danny.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.119
Can you wave? Wave to daddy.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.913
- Can you wave to daddy?
- Wait a minute.

06:04.914 --> 06:06.794
Wait a minute. That's
my aunt Margot, right?

06:06.795 --> 06:09.779
Uh, yeah. Why does she
look like she's pregnant?

06:09.780 --> 06:11.916
<i>Riley: Because she is.</i>

06:11.917 --> 06:16.137
Oh my God. She couldn't have
been much more than like 16.

06:16.531 --> 06:18.895
So? Isn't being a teen mom

06:18.896 --> 06:21.217
kind of a rite of passage for you people?

06:22.268 --> 06:24.962
But Margot doesn't have
any kids, all right?

06:24.963 --> 06:26.432
She said she didn't want to be tied down.

06:26.433 --> 06:28.049
Oh, my God. How did I not know this?

06:28.050 --> 06:30.228
Should I just tell her that I know,

06:30.229 --> 06:31.770
or I could kinda hint at it,

06:31.771 --> 06:34.270
or say I saw your old video? Oh, my God.

06:34.271 --> 06:37.291
I can't believe my family
finally has a juicy dark secret.

06:37.292 --> 06:38.884
I'll... I'll talk to you guys later.

06:39.963 --> 06:41.922
<i>- (Door closes)
- Wait, hold up.</i>

06:41.923 --> 06:44.431
Why do scandalous secrets have to be dark?

06:44.432 --> 06:46.376
I mean, that's just racist. (Chuckles)

06:46.377 --> 06:49.043
What's wrong with a juicy white secret?

06:49.928 --> 06:52.485
Yeah, I don't think
that's their only secret.

06:52.486 --> 06:54.552
That might be Riley's aunt Margot,

06:54.553 --> 06:56.863
but that very unpregnant woman

06:56.864 --> 06:59.229
- is Riley's mom.
- So?

06:59.632 --> 07:02.973
So? Riley was born just two
weeks after my first birthday.

07:02.974 --> 07:04.787
Her mom should be ready to explode.

07:05.145 --> 07:08.637
- So you're saying...
- I think Riley's mom is her aunt

07:08.638 --> 07:10.291
and her aunt is her mom.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.553
Oh, that is one juicy white secret.

07:14.582 --> 07:16.541
See? It totally works.

07:18.144 --> 07:20.396
Jenny, come on. You don't
give somebody freezer burn

07:20.397 --> 07:21.972
over half their body and then pretend

07:21.973 --> 07:23.576
like it's not nice to see them again.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.336
Yeah, fine, it's nice to see you again.

07:26.337 --> 07:28.174
And you know what would be even nicer?

07:28.496 --> 07:29.818
Seeing you go.

07:30.267 --> 07:32.399
Please, your dad still can't be mad.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.808
- It's been almost seven years.
- Ben, you don't know my dad.

07:34.809 --> 07:36.647
He never met a grudge he didn't like.

07:37.225 --> 07:38.634
Okay okay, fine.

07:38.635 --> 07:40.860
How about you just let us
have Emma's birthday here then?

07:41.367 --> 07:42.969
It's not really up to me.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.013
You have got a lot of nerve
coming in here like this.

07:47.014 --> 07:50.913
Come on. It is my
granddaughter's first birthday.

07:50.914 --> 07:54.531
If you had any grandkids, you would
understand how important this is.

07:54.532 --> 07:56.620
Are you... you're kidding me, right? You...

07:56.621 --> 07:58.714
Hey, grandpa, come on!
Help me make a sundae!

07:58.715 --> 08:00.140
Okay, all right. Hey, hold up.

08:00.141 --> 08:01.559
I want to introduce you to somebody.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.108
This is my grandson... Ben.

08:07.968 --> 08:09.408
- Ben?
- Yeah.

08:09.409 --> 08:11.894
She wanted to name him after the father.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.485
Ben?

08:17.851 --> 08:20.144
Seriously, I can't believe he
threw me out of there again.

08:20.145 --> 08:23.174
I'm pretty sure I wasn't the first
person to defrost Jenny DeLuca.

08:24.364 --> 08:27.242
So, Ben, take me back.

08:27.243 --> 08:29.449
Exactly how long ago were you banned

08:29.450 --> 08:30.799
from Frankie & Bobbie's?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.568
I don't know, like seven years ago.

08:32.570 --> 08:34.706
How does six years and nine months sound?

08:34.707 --> 08:36.030
About right.

08:36.578 --> 08:38.422
I don't suppose when you and Jenny were

08:38.423 --> 08:41.419
rolling around in that
freezer you covered up?

08:41.419 --> 08:44.020
Well, it was pretty cold in there,
so I definitely had a coat on.

08:44.847 --> 08:47.716
- On the part that counts?
- I was 16...

08:48.048 --> 08:49.522
And an idiot...

08:50.263 --> 08:52.020
And in a rush, so no, probably not.

08:53.804 --> 08:55.363
Why are you asking me all these questions?

08:55.364 --> 08:58.841
Because Jenny has
a six-year-old son...

08:58.842 --> 09:00.811
Oh! Glad I dodged that bullet.

09:02.015 --> 09:03.561
Named Ben.

09:03.562 --> 09:06.315
Wow. I can't believe she named
her kid after me. That's really...

09:08.951 --> 09:11.130
- Oh, my God!
- Exactly!

09:11.131 --> 09:12.547
No, there's no way.

09:12.548 --> 09:14.378
Well, I guess there was a way.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.333
- There were several ways.
- Oh, God, don't tell me!

09:16.334 --> 09:18.477
- Are you sure?
- Well, Frankie DeLuca is.

09:18.478 --> 09:21.125
- Well, what am I gonna do?
- Well, either build a time machine

09:21.126 --> 09:23.442
so you can fix your
mistakes or take 30 seconds

09:23.443 --> 09:25.725
and read the instructions
on the back of a condom!

09:29.277 --> 09:33.025
- Put it on.
- No. I'm not gonna put it on.

09:33.336 --> 09:34.837
I said put it on.

09:36.353 --> 09:37.632
Fine.

09:40.503 --> 09:41.937
How do you feel?

09:42.538 --> 09:44.633
My palms are sweating a little bit,

09:44.634 --> 09:46.028
but my nose is warm.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.973
(Chuckles) Now let's do
something about your cold feet.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.994
(Scoffs) I don't see
what's so funny about that.

09:53.995 --> 09:55.891
It's basically just a pair of my shoes.

09:56.403 --> 09:57.940
Slightly smaller.

09:59.810 --> 10:01.883
No more Mr. nice clown, Danny.

10:01.884 --> 10:03.827
It's time to pull on your big Bozo pants

10:03.828 --> 10:05.162
and clown up.

10:25.927 --> 10:06.902
Do it for Emma.

10:06.903 --> 10:08.779
<i>(Cellphone buzzes)</i>

10:11.318 --> 10:13.945
It's Riley. She's with Margot.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.784
What if Riley asks her about the baby?

10:15.785 --> 10:17.774
What if Margot tells
her that she's her mom?

10:18.899 --> 10:21.378
I mean, I guess I would wanna know.

10:21.379 --> 10:23.127
Well, if I grew up with your mom

10:23.128 --> 10:25.187
and there was a chance
that I could get a new one,

10:25.188 --> 10:28.632
- I'd wanna know too.
- But what if Riley's devastated?

10:28.633 --> 10:30.600
I should be there for her. I gotta go.

10:31.468 --> 10:33.045
(Yelps)

10:33.046 --> 10:35.277
Yeah, still super creepy.

10:35.827 --> 10:37.934
(Sighs) I love Emma,

10:37.935 --> 10:39.647
and I shall prove it by purchasing

10:39.648 --> 10:41.574
a very extravagant gift.

10:42.221 --> 10:43.463
I'm thinking puppy.

10:44.650 --> 10:47.420
Well, here, take this to cheer Riley up.

10:49.051 --> 10:50.557
I believe it's a donkey.

10:53.219 --> 10:56.294
I didn't think a teenager
with a 10:00 curfew

10:56.295 --> 10:59.822
and a hamster named Luke Perry
should be raising a child.

11:00.657 --> 11:03.142
Hey, ladies, what are we talking about?

11:03.143 --> 11:04.630
Anyone need a shoulder to cry on?

11:04.631 --> 11:05.878
I brought two.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.236
You are not gonna believe
what aunt Margot just told me.

11:08.237 --> 11:11.364
She gave up a baby for adoption
when she was a teenager.

11:11.934 --> 11:13.648
It's okay if I tell people, right?

11:14.783 --> 11:17.372
Wow, really? Is that all she told you?

11:17.749 --> 11:21.763
Well, I also mentioned I had a out
of body experience in a sweat lodge,

11:21.764 --> 11:24.336
but the baby was kinda the big news.

11:25.636 --> 11:28.895
It was a girl and she never saw her again.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.413
- (Inhales deeply)
- God, it's so crazy to think

11:30.414 --> 11:31.623
that I have a cousin out there somewhere

11:31.624 --> 11:33.872
who's almost exactly the same age as me.

11:34.184 --> 11:35.511
- (Margot chuckles)
- I mean, how weird would it be

11:35.512 --> 11:37.873
- if I actually knew her?
- Danny and margot: Very.

11:38.836 --> 11:41.869
Oh, Riley, you've got a
little stain on your blouse.

11:41.870 --> 11:43.762
- Oh, where?
- Right there.

11:44.764 --> 11:46.429
Oh. Eww. Sorry, I'll be right back.

11:47.853 --> 11:51.169
(Loudly) So, Margot, how you been?

11:51.170 --> 11:52.460
Haven't seen you in a couple...

11:52.461 --> 11:54.136
(softly) I know the
truth about you and Riley.

11:54.891 --> 11:56.886
Oh, I don't suppose you're talking about

11:56.887 --> 11:59.929
that time we got arrested
at a Van Halen concert?

11:59.930 --> 12:02.501
My bad. I totally made
her hold my backpack.

12:03.351 --> 12:05.142
No, that she's your daughter.

12:05.143 --> 12:07.796
(Sighs) And that's what I was afraid of.

12:08.582 --> 12:10.225
How did you figure it out?

12:10.226 --> 12:11.456
It wasn't that hard.

12:11.457 --> 12:12.844
I just put two and two together.

12:12.845 --> 12:14.419
I thought you were the slow one.

12:15.394 --> 12:17.201
You have to tell her. She deserves to know.

12:17.202 --> 12:20.139
Actually, I don't. It's
not my place to tell her.

12:20.597 --> 12:21.886
It's her mom's,

12:21.887 --> 12:24.399
my sister, the woman who raised her.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.700
I promised I would never tell,

12:26.701 --> 12:28.441
and now you have to promise, too.

12:28.845 --> 12:30.219
Can you do that?

12:30.587 --> 12:32.752
You know, between this and the clown thing,

12:32.753 --> 12:34.307
you people are really asking a lot.

12:35.734 --> 12:37.480
Wait... I'm the slow one?

12:39.760 --> 12:40.989
<i>(Bell jingles)</i>

12:40.990 --> 12:42.003
We're closed.

12:42.004 --> 12:44.437
And I already got the 9 and
the 1 pushed on my phone.

12:45.484 --> 12:47.005
Hey, it's me again.

12:47.006 --> 12:48.079
I think we need to talk.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.466
Seriously?

12:49.467 --> 12:51.595
How many times I gotta
throw you out of here?

12:51.957 --> 12:53.252
Like a cockroach.

12:54.558 --> 12:56.638
Daddy, please. I can handle him.

12:56.639 --> 12:59.430
(Scoffs) Handling him is why
you are here in the first place.

13:01.639 --> 13:03.995
Fine. I'm going to give you two minutes.

13:03.996 --> 13:05.419
Then I'm going to call the cops.

13:05.420 --> 13:07.798
Also known as my cousin Tony.

13:10.142 --> 13:11.551
Ben, what are you doing here?

13:11.552 --> 13:12.645
You're going to get me in trouble.

13:13.014 --> 13:14.590
I think we've pretty much established

13:14.591 --> 13:15.991
that I've already done that.

13:16.767 --> 13:19.194
Now is really not a good time to talk.

13:19.195 --> 13:21.521
What about the last seven years? Busy?

13:22.375 --> 13:24.332
You want to have your kid's
birthday party here? Fine.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.746
My dad won't even be here tomorrow.

13:25.747 --> 13:27.477
Honestly, that's not really why I'm here.

13:27.787 --> 13:29.948
Although I will take the 2:00 to 4:00 slot.

13:31.069 --> 13:32.394
<i>One minute!</i>

13:32.395 --> 13:35.461
<i>And I already got the 9 and
the 1 pushed on my phone.</i>

13:36.187 --> 13:37.808
Ben, we were fine without you.

13:37.809 --> 13:39.225
We'll be fine when you leave.

13:39.226 --> 13:41.416
Seriously, you gotta get out.

13:41.890 --> 13:43.834
If only you'd told me that seven years ago.

13:48.936 --> 13:50.316
Oh, hey!

13:50.317 --> 13:51.669
That's a good idea.

13:51.670 --> 13:53.031
Numbering your kids.

13:54.082 --> 13:55.551
Mom, what am I gonna do?

13:55.552 --> 13:56.990
Jenny won't even talk to me about it.

13:56.991 --> 13:59.385
Well, let's just make
sure that we give Emma

13:59.386 --> 14:02.728
a memorable first birthday, all right?

14:02.729 --> 14:04.884
And then, we will welcome little Ben

14:04.885 --> 14:07.928
into this freak show we
insist on calling a family.

14:09.311 --> 14:10.559
Why do women keep having babies

14:10.560 --> 14:12.208
and not telling me about them?

14:12.209 --> 14:13.824
It's starting to hurt my feelings.

14:14.738 --> 14:15.863
<i>(Bell jingles)</i>

14:16.195 --> 14:17.360
All right.

14:18.298 --> 14:20.225
Where do you want Tuck-Tuck the clown?

14:20.226 --> 14:21.905
- Tuck-tuck?
- I know.

14:21.906 --> 14:23.972
Can you believe "Tuckles"
was already taken?

14:25.473 --> 14:28.162
Can I interest you in either a snake

14:28.522 --> 14:29.866
or a hot dog?

14:31.093 --> 14:33.067
Oh, in a minute. I got a
little unfinished business.

14:36.889 --> 14:38.286
(Both exclaim)

14:39.132 --> 14:40.094
Really?

14:40.095 --> 14:41.401
You couldn't have told
me you changed your mind

14:41.402 --> 14:43.299
before I got on the subway like this?

14:43.710 --> 14:45.884
I realized I had to do it for Emma.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.099
Do you know how long it takes

14:47.100 --> 14:48.694
to explain to a transit cop

14:48.695 --> 14:50.847
why you've got a rubber
chicken in your pants?

14:51.653 --> 14:53.773
Actually... I do.

14:57.501 --> 14:58.655
Oh, hey, Riley.

14:58.656 --> 15:00.417
- Hey!
- Oh, nice timing.

15:00.418 --> 15:01.765
Does somebody send you an alert

15:01.766 --> 15:03.052
when fresh cake arrives?

15:04.016 --> 15:05.484
Oh, my God. How great would that be?

15:06.472 --> 15:08.517
So I can't believe you never told me

15:08.518 --> 15:10.074
about the whole baby thing.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.743
Honey, if I had to tell you every time

15:11.744 --> 15:14.635
Ben does something stupid, we
would never leave the house.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.725
No, I had dinner with
my aunt Margot last night

15:18.726 --> 15:20.239
and she told me everything.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.775
(Sighs, laughs)

15:21.776 --> 15:23.080
Thank God.

15:23.081 --> 15:25.478
I've been keeping that
one locked up for years.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.129
I just... I don't understand

15:28.130 --> 15:29.450
why it was such a secret.

15:29.984 --> 15:31.817
I feel bad for aunt Margot.

15:32.378 --> 15:34.210
Well, I feel bad for you.

15:34.211 --> 15:36.830
You're the one who lost
out on having a cool mom

15:36.831 --> 15:38.822
and got stuck with the, well...

15:38.823 --> 15:40.401
You know her better than anyone.

15:42.644 --> 15:44.408
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

15:44.409 --> 15:45.678
Well, I was just trying to avoid

15:45.679 --> 15:47.136
calling your mom a bitch.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.015
Are you saying aunt Margot's my mom?

15:53.436 --> 15:54.831
No...

15:58.421 --> 16:01.583
So Margot had a baby and that baby was me?

16:01.983 --> 16:03.358
What?!

16:05.942 --> 16:07.389
Excuse me.

16:08.445 --> 16:11.250
Well, I kept my mouth shut for 25 years.

16:11.251 --> 16:12.769
Any points for that?

16:14.491 --> 16:16.778
Jenny, we can't pretend
like nothing happened.

16:16.779 --> 16:18.690
Sure we can. Watch me.

16:19.580 --> 16:21.592
See? Doing it right now.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.526
Well, I can't.

16:23.527 --> 16:26.421
Mostly because I know
something happened... he's 6,

16:26.422 --> 16:28.601
<i>his name is Ben, and quite frankly,</i>

16:28.602 --> 16:30.890
I think you're letting him have
a little bit too much ice cream.

16:32.212 --> 16:33.960
Ben, I am begging you.

16:33.961 --> 16:35.622
Have your party and go home.

16:36.389 --> 16:37.539
<i>Bonnie:  Okay.</i>

16:37.540 --> 16:40.868
I think our little
princess is almost ready.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.781
So, what do you say we throw
my little girl a party, huh?

16:43.782 --> 16:44.982
- All right.
- (Chuckling)

16:45.315 --> 16:46.911
Oh, my God.

16:46.912 --> 16:49.707
It's so hard to believe that
you're already a year old.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.611
No one thought we'd make it.

16:51.612 --> 16:52.864
Mostly me.

16:54.371 --> 16:56.070
But there were moments
where I could see you too

16:56.071 --> 16:57.386
had your doubts.

16:58.377 --> 17:00.027
Emma, before you came along,

17:00.028 --> 17:02.776
a lot of people would have
described me as selfish...

17:02.777 --> 17:04.000
Narcissistic.

17:04.001 --> 17:06.140
- Ooh, unreliable.
- Oh! Inconsiderate.

17:07.789 --> 17:09.700
I was just going to say "immature,"

17:09.701 --> 17:11.032
but fine.

17:12.630 --> 17:14.801
Emma, dare I say,

17:14.803 --> 17:16.988
being your father has made me a better man.

17:17.707 --> 17:18.762
(Murmurs)

17:24.862 --> 17:27.373
And when I think that I could
have lived my life without you...

17:28.434 --> 17:29.804
It breaks my heart.

17:31.435 --> 17:34.477
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

17:35.198 --> 17:36.488
Um...

17:36.489 --> 17:39.213
Balloons, clowns, cakes...

17:39.214 --> 17:40.985
it's a birthday party, dude.

17:43.781 --> 17:45.333
Balloon baguette?

17:46.423 --> 17:47.783
(Mouthing)

17:50.990 --> 17:52.853
Jenny, you can't keep my son from me.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.462
I want to be a father to little Ben.

17:54.463 --> 17:56.300
- Son?
- Wait, little Ben?

17:56.301 --> 17:57.827
Keep his son from him?

17:57.828 --> 18:00.301
You told me he didn't want to
have anything to do with you.

18:00.635 --> 18:02.930
Because it was easier
than telling you the truth.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.300
Ben's not the father.

18:05.624 --> 18:07.141
I'm not? Are you sure?

18:07.142 --> 18:08.650
'Cause that kid looks just like me.

18:10.201 --> 18:11.849
Well, then, who is the father?

18:12.191 --> 18:13.377
Bobby Junior.

18:14.056 --> 18:16.702
(Stammers) My old
partner's kid, the convict?

18:16.703 --> 18:18.291
Oh, ho! That's great!

18:18.292 --> 18:20.293
He's even a worse choice than this idiot.

18:20.294 --> 18:23.078
Hey! Frankie DeLuca, you would be lucky

18:23.079 --> 18:25.214
if my son impregnated your daughter.

18:25.215 --> 18:26.101
Eh!

18:27.095 --> 18:28.694
But I didn't, right?

18:29.840 --> 18:31.216
No.

18:31.217 --> 18:32.466
When I told you I was pregnant,

18:32.467 --> 18:33.783
you just assumed it was Ben's,

18:33.784 --> 18:35.599
- so I let you think that.
- Well, yeah!

18:35.600 --> 18:38.206
I never thought he'd be dumb
enough to come back here.

18:38.207 --> 18:40.783
You'd be shocked at the
things he's dumb enough to do.

18:41.874 --> 18:42.890
I'm sorry.

18:43.231 --> 18:44.646
But I gotta say...

18:44.647 --> 18:46.148
Emma's a lucky girl.

18:47.354 --> 18:49.565
She's also a very sleepy girl.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.271
<i>I think we might have missed
our birthday window, people.</i>

18:53.917 --> 18:56.188
Hey, where's Riley?

18:56.189 --> 18:58.231
Saw her headed for the freezer

18:58.232 --> 19:00.055
with a very big spoon.

19:06.996 --> 19:08.041
<i>(Sighs)</i>

19:12.546 --> 19:13.915
Riley, it's gonna be okay.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.939
No! It's not.

19:15.940 --> 19:18.586
I mean, I don't even know who I am.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.609
You're Riley Perrin.

19:22.610 --> 19:24.104
The sweetest girl I know.

19:24.495 --> 19:26.032
No offense, but...

19:26.604 --> 19:28.921
It's kind of hard to take
you seriously right now.

19:32.427 --> 19:33.924
I mean, I just don't get it.

19:34.711 --> 19:37.106
You know, why didn't she want me?

19:37.107 --> 19:39.736
Why did she give me up? Didn't she love me?

19:39.737 --> 19:41.583
She loved you so much

19:41.584 --> 19:43.691
she had to let you go.

19:44.312 --> 19:45.988
What are you doing here?

19:45.989 --> 19:47.315
I called her.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.692
I thought you two should talk.

19:48.693 --> 19:50.666
And I'll never say no to ice cream.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.038
I mean, I am your mom.

19:55.022 --> 19:57.922
Yeah. So I've heard.

20:07.421 --> 20:09.028
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

20:09.771 --> 20:11.738
It's just that I saw how happy you were

20:12.215 --> 20:15.088
and how beautiful and how smart and...

20:15.914 --> 20:18.133
And I knew I'd made the right decision.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.510
But we could have been together.

20:23.067 --> 20:24.548
You could have been with me.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.025
I'm with you now.

20:30.017 --> 20:31.886
Please let that be enough.

20:33.477 --> 20:34.964
See?

20:36.464 --> 20:38.275
Isn't this nice?

20:39.831 --> 20:41.093
(Shouts)

20:42.539 --> 20:44.893
Yep, still creepy.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.508
Okay, people, let's do this.

20:51.056 --> 20:52.820
- Hi, sweetie.
- Where's the cake?

20:55.960 --> 20:58.471
Oh. Was this for Emma?

20:58.472 --> 21:00.155
Yes, it's for Emma.

21:00.156 --> 21:02.824
You know how you know?
It says "Emma" on it.

21:02.825 --> 21:05.606
See? Now you know how these things happen.

21:06.693 --> 21:07.774
Well, baby,

21:07.775 --> 21:09.386
maybe this isn't what you signed up for.

21:09.387 --> 21:11.663
But you're stuck with us.

21:12.266 --> 21:13.288
(Soft chuckling)

21:13.289 --> 21:15.288
All: Happy Birthday, Emma.
