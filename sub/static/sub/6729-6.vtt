01:21.743 --> 01:25.956
<i>There was a kind of freedom
to being under Kilgrave's control.</i>

01:26.039 --> 01:30.210
<i>You're not a slave
to guilt or fear or even logic.</i>

01:30.293 --> 01:31.920
<i>You just do what you're told.</i>

01:39.511 --> 01:42.889
If you light that thing,
I'll make you put it out in your eye.

01:44.224 --> 01:45.642
I'd like to see you try.

01:46.184 --> 01:49.646
Assholes try. I just do.
Put that out.

01:55.193 --> 01:57.863
Okay, gentlemen,
who's feeling lucky?

01:57.946 --> 02:01.492
All righty.
What do we have this time?

02:04.370 --> 02:07.122
You might want to work on that poker face.

02:07.205 --> 02:09.583
What the hell? I'm all in.

02:10.917 --> 02:13.169
Friggin' weirdo.

02:13.253 --> 02:14.671
I'm out.

02:14.755 --> 02:17.257
What? Where are your balls?

02:17.341 --> 02:19.217
Don't we all have balls here?

02:19.300 --> 02:21.177
Ladies, tell us we all have balls.

02:21.261 --> 02:22.637
You have balls.

02:22.721 --> 02:25.223
See? You have balls,
Harvey, so go all in.

02:33.982 --> 02:35.401
Man knows how to live.

02:35.484 --> 02:37.944
Tell you what,
let's take a walk on the wild side.

02:38.028 --> 02:39.988
Let's have everybody go all in.

02:40.071 --> 02:41.948
Let her ride.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.244
Yeah!

02:46.327 --> 02:48.704
Now it's getting interesting.

02:48.789 --> 02:50.957
Best estimate.
Where's the pot right now?

02:51.041 --> 02:52.626
Just over a million dollars.

02:52.709 --> 02:55.254
Yeah, that should do it.

02:55.336 --> 02:58.757
Let's make it really crazy.
Everybody fold.

03:02.385 --> 03:06.097
Oh, I guess that makes me the winner.

03:06.181 --> 03:08.308
And me with a deuce and a seven.

03:08.975 --> 03:10.295
Would you pack this money for me?

03:11.061 --> 03:13.855
You'll be dining out
on this story for years.

03:13.939 --> 03:17.776
The night you lost a million dollars
to the worst hand you had ever seen.

03:19.027 --> 03:20.403
You're leaving?

03:24.074 --> 03:25.075
For the luck.

03:26.993 --> 03:28.119
Thank you.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.709
Seriously?

03:34.793 --> 03:36.211
I don't know what just happened there,

03:36.294 --> 03:38.934
but you're gonna sit down
and give us a shot to win our money back.

03:39.715 --> 03:40.799
I've got a better idea.

03:40.882 --> 03:44.636
Let's see how long it takes you
to put your head through that post.

03:45.929 --> 03:46.972
Go on.

03:53.479 --> 03:56.523
- Hey, stop it!
- Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing? Harvey!

03:56.607 --> 03:58.734
Harvey, stop! Stop!

03:58.817 --> 04:04.030
The beauty of what he does
is that nobody knows how he does this.

04:04.114 --> 04:05.954
It can't be explained,
so it can't be believed.

04:06.032 --> 04:08.577
It doesn't matter how he does it.

04:08.660 --> 04:11.246
It matters where,
so I can catch him.

04:11.329 --> 04:14.500
Did he have a new favorite bar?

04:14.583 --> 04:17.209
Did he catch movies at the Nitehawk?

04:17.293 --> 04:18.795
You have to know something.

04:18.879 --> 04:20.505
I know that his powers aren't magic.

04:23.049 --> 04:24.217
How do you know that?

04:24.300 --> 04:26.512
The same way I know
that elves don't exist.

04:26.595 --> 04:28.805
I preferred your brain on drugs.

04:29.973 --> 04:32.601
Look, I'm just saying
that if we pool our information,

04:32.684 --> 04:36.480
then maybe we can
hone in on his limitations, you know?

04:36.563 --> 04:37.564
Profile him.

04:37.648 --> 04:40.942
You want to discuss him?
Fine, go to that survivor's group.

04:41.026 --> 04:43.779
But if you want to catch him,
give me something I can use.

04:55.582 --> 04:57.626
Who is it?

04:57.709 --> 04:58.919
Luke.

04:59.002 --> 05:00.378
Who's Luke?

05:05.258 --> 05:07.818
- What are you doing here?
- I want to hire you.

05:07.844 --> 05:10.263
In the middle of the night?
He's been Kilgraved.

05:10.346 --> 05:12.515
- Open the door, Jones.
- Don't!

05:20.190 --> 05:21.858
Are you hurt?

05:21.942 --> 05:23.193
Sorry, stupid question.

05:23.276 --> 05:27.405
Just keep your distance, all right?
Or I'm gonna have to kick your ass.

05:29.866 --> 05:32.285
If he had been Kilgraved,
you'd be dead by now.

05:33.119 --> 05:35.038
- What's a Kilgrave?
- Go home.

05:38.584 --> 05:40.210
Why are you really here?

05:42.671 --> 05:44.047
Like I said...

05:45.757 --> 05:47.342
I want to hire you.

05:47.425 --> 05:49.427
To do what?

05:49.510 --> 05:50.721
Find someone.

05:53.514 --> 05:56.893
I'm giving you the name of
a top-notch private investigator.

05:57.936 --> 06:01.481
Angela Del Toro.
Reasonable rates.

06:01.564 --> 06:03.108
I came to you.

06:03.191 --> 06:04.860
And you shouldn't have.

06:04.943 --> 06:08.196
You know how hard it was
for me to show up on your doorstep?

06:08.279 --> 06:11.407
I need this handled fast, discreetly,

06:11.491 --> 06:13.785
by someone who brings something...

06:13.869 --> 06:15.621
extra to the table,

06:15.704 --> 06:17.706
in case it gets rough.

06:17.789 --> 06:20.125
Looks like it already got rough.

06:26.673 --> 06:28.591
Start at the beginning.

06:29.968 --> 06:31.928
Kid's name is Antoine Grier.

06:32.012 --> 06:35.223
He got in deep to a loan shark.
Disappeared a week ago.

06:35.306 --> 06:37.893
And you want to find him because...

06:37.976 --> 06:41.897
His sister's worried about him.
Her name's Serena.

06:41.980 --> 06:45.525
Serena gave money to Antoine
to pay off a loan shark.

06:45.608 --> 06:49.362
I had a little conversation
with the shark's boys.

06:50.113 --> 06:53.199
Seems Antoine hasn't
made any payments in weeks.

06:55.618 --> 06:58.830
You said you only protect yourself
and what's yours.

06:58.914 --> 07:00.498
I promised his sister.

07:03.794 --> 07:05.378
Is she yours?

07:08.006 --> 07:09.966
You really want to know?

07:15.681 --> 07:16.973
Help me find him, Jones.

07:18.934 --> 07:21.770
Keep the money.
I owe you a favor.

07:23.396 --> 07:25.148
I didn't ask for a favor.

07:31.571 --> 07:33.489
Text me any information
you have on Antoine,

07:33.573 --> 07:35.867
phone number, address.

07:35.951 --> 07:38.161
I went by his place already.
He's not there.

07:38.244 --> 07:40.246
- I'll take another look.
- Tonight?

07:41.665 --> 07:43.124
First thing tomorrow.

08:08.649 --> 08:10.860
Shit.

08:19.494 --> 08:21.705
If this is a booty call,
I like your chances.

08:21.788 --> 08:23.790
It's Hogarth.

08:23.874 --> 08:26.167
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

08:26.251 --> 08:28.253
<i>Look, I still don't have
any dirt on your ex.</i>

08:28.336 --> 08:31.422
I think you're gonna have to accept
that maybe she's clean.

08:31.506 --> 08:33.133
<i>Well, keep looking.</i>

08:33.216 --> 08:34.549
That isn't why I'm calling.

08:34.634 --> 08:37.846
I just picked up a message
from the prison infirmary.

08:37.929 --> 08:39.264
Hope Shlottman was attacked.

08:40.556 --> 08:42.850
God damn it.

08:44.435 --> 08:46.437
God damn it!

08:50.942 --> 08:54.821
- Hey. Was it Kilgrave?
- Doesn't appear to be.

08:54.905 --> 08:55.989
Wait, you're leaving?

08:56.072 --> 08:58.074
Not a lot I can do.

08:58.158 --> 09:01.327
Hope refuses to accuse her attacker.
No one saw anything.

09:01.411 --> 09:03.246
- Bullshit.
- Of course it's bullshit.

09:03.329 --> 09:06.875
Which is why I bribed a guard.
He was not cheap.

09:07.542 --> 09:08.960
You know who did it.

09:09.044 --> 09:10.045
This case is getting

09:10.128 --> 09:12.088
- very expensive, Jessica...
- Name!

09:15.759 --> 09:19.220
Word has it
the attacker's name is Sissy Garcia.

09:19.304 --> 09:21.306
Garcia could have been Kilgraved.

09:21.389 --> 09:22.849
I checked the logs.

09:22.933 --> 09:26.937
Garcia had no visitors before or after.
No contact with anyone other than Hope.

09:27.020 --> 09:29.314
He doesn't leave fingerprints.

09:29.397 --> 09:31.649
Regardless, Hope will not speak to me.

09:31.732 --> 09:33.443
She will not ask for isolation.

09:33.526 --> 09:36.112
So, Garcia's free to do it again.

09:36.196 --> 09:39.574
Expensive and exasperating.
Your turn.

09:55.256 --> 09:56.466
Whoever you are, <i>puta,</i>

09:57.508 --> 10:01.512
this visit don't start
until Sissy gets her snacks.

10:01.596 --> 10:03.514
Cash for the machines.

10:07.393 --> 10:09.520
Thanks, sexy.

10:15.610 --> 10:19.155
I think this is what they call
a conundrum.

10:19.239 --> 10:23.869
Takis or SunChips?

10:25.036 --> 10:26.204
Ahh!

10:27.205 --> 10:28.748
- Whatever problem you have...
- What?

10:28.832 --> 10:31.918
...with Hope Shlottman ends now
or I take your hand home with me.

10:32.002 --> 10:35.672
<i>Gringa loca,</i>
that wasn't no beef, man.

10:35.755 --> 10:37.382
That was services rendered.

10:37.465 --> 10:40.510
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Hope wanted that beat down.

10:40.593 --> 10:42.052
Bullshit.

10:43.638 --> 10:48.226
She paid me for it.
Fifty bucks and a pack of smokes.

10:48.309 --> 10:49.810
God!

10:51.354 --> 10:54.232
Bitch, best be careful
messing with my digits.

10:55.859 --> 10:58.069
I got ladies to satisfy.

11:16.462 --> 11:19.465
You hired Sissy with my money
to take you out.

11:20.216 --> 11:21.801
Fifty bucks and a pack of smokes.

11:21.884 --> 11:23.761
Not to kill me.

11:23.844 --> 11:25.055
Then what?

11:27.265 --> 11:29.350
Are you punishing yourself?

11:31.019 --> 11:33.271
You can't pay penance
for something you didn't do.

11:33.354 --> 11:34.439
I'm not.

11:36.191 --> 11:38.526
- God damn it, Hope.
- I'm pregnant.

11:42.697 --> 11:44.157
Still.

11:49.620 --> 11:54.042
I can feel it growing like a tumor.

12:00.423 --> 12:02.300
They have a doctor on call here.

12:02.383 --> 12:05.886
Two months. That's the soonest
the doctor can get to me.

12:05.971 --> 12:07.347
Hogarth will get
the appointment moved up.

12:07.430 --> 12:10.016
No, I'm not waiting.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.768
Every second it's there,

12:12.852 --> 12:15.605
I get raped...

12:15.688 --> 12:17.648
again and again.

12:17.732 --> 12:21.361
My parents are shot...

12:21.444 --> 12:23.696
again and again.

12:26.199 --> 12:29.785
One beating was more likely to kill you
than cause a miscarriage.

12:29.869 --> 12:32.122
It was worth the risk.

12:32.205 --> 12:33.999
It'll be worth the next risk.

12:34.790 --> 12:35.916
Whatever it takes.

12:36.001 --> 12:37.377
Jesus, Hope.

12:39.129 --> 12:41.797
I want to live.

12:41.881 --> 12:44.425
I want to have children, but...

12:44.509 --> 12:46.761
I won't give life...

12:46.844 --> 12:48.221
to this...

12:48.304 --> 12:49.430
thing.

12:50.556 --> 12:51.766
I won't do it.

12:56.687 --> 12:58.023
Okay.

13:18.376 --> 13:21.587
<i>Someone missing
as long as Antoine usually stays missing.</i>

13:21.671 --> 13:25.007
<i>Normally, I don't give a shit.
More billable hours for me.</i>

13:25.091 --> 13:28.803
<i>But Luke being the client
makes this case personal,</i>

13:28.886 --> 13:30.471
<i>which is against my policy.</i>

13:55.455 --> 13:57.415
Everybody, quiet!

14:09.385 --> 14:11.596
Cutting it close, Miss Jones.

15:21.207 --> 15:22.583
Luke, what the hell?

15:22.667 --> 15:24.294
I thought you said,
"Tomorrow, first thing"?

15:24.377 --> 15:28.589
- I had to deal with something.
- More important than a paying customer?

15:28.673 --> 15:30.383
Life and death, actually.

15:30.466 --> 15:32.802
Figured you were blowing me off.

15:34.637 --> 15:36.181
I wouldn't just bail on you.

15:36.264 --> 15:38.558
You've done it before.

15:40.643 --> 15:42.770
I don't even know
what the hell I'm looking for.

15:42.853 --> 15:46.357
Anything that points
to where Antoine might've gone.

15:46.441 --> 15:48.859
Airline receipts, train schedules.

15:50.027 --> 15:51.862
Won't find any of that
if someone grabbed him.

15:51.946 --> 15:53.364
No one did.

15:53.448 --> 15:56.867
Antoine's toothbrush, toothpaste
and deodorant are all missing.

15:56.951 --> 15:59.329
Kidnappers aren't generally
big on hygiene.

15:59.412 --> 16:00.413
He packed up.

16:01.164 --> 16:03.499
Which probably means Antoine's okay.

16:03.583 --> 16:04.917
Still gotta find him.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.794
Because you promised his sister?

16:06.877 --> 16:09.339
Is there another reason why you're
so amped up about this?

16:09.422 --> 16:11.716
I keep my word.

16:16.596 --> 16:20.140
Welcome to the Holy Grail of P.I. work.

16:23.769 --> 16:27.940
Eye-drops, lot of ash...
rolling papers.

16:28.899 --> 16:30.150
Antoine's a pothead.

16:30.235 --> 16:34.822
Lottery tickets, contest entry forms.
Optimistic sucker.

16:34.905 --> 16:36.199
Stupid.

16:37.575 --> 16:39.285
But useful stupid.

16:45.583 --> 16:46.626
Hi!

16:46.709 --> 16:51.005
This message is for Antoine Grier.
Congratulations!

16:51.088 --> 16:52.632
You're a winner!

16:52.715 --> 16:55.593
Give us a call back within 24 hours
at this number

16:55.676 --> 17:00.055
or your Xbox One prize will be forfeited.
Okay, thanks. Bye!

17:03.226 --> 17:04.227
Not bad.

17:07.730 --> 17:09.650
How often does that
"you're a winner" thing work?

17:09.732 --> 17:11.776
You'd be surprised.

17:11.858 --> 17:13.109
Are you following me?

17:13.193 --> 17:14.487
Did Kilgrave send you?

17:16.989 --> 17:19.617
These guys work for Sirkes,
the loan shark Antoine owes.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.493
Didn't I just kick your ass yesterday?

17:21.577 --> 17:23.204
So that was you.

17:24.997 --> 17:27.557
I was looking for Antoine.
I thought you might know where he was.

17:27.583 --> 17:28.668
And you thought I kidnapped him.

17:28.751 --> 17:31.962
Why would I do that?
It doesn't get me my money back.

17:32.046 --> 17:34.757
You want your money.
I want to find Antoine.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.966
How about we work together?

17:36.050 --> 17:38.303
You're talking about
a business arrangement?

17:38.386 --> 17:40.805
- I am.
- The hell you are.

17:42.432 --> 17:43.766
Take it down a notch, Jones.

17:43.849 --> 17:48.062
Look, you rough up my employees,
that hurts my professional reputation.

17:48.145 --> 17:49.522
That's all any businessman has.

17:50.981 --> 17:52.650
Asshole thinks he's Carl Icahn.

17:54.485 --> 17:56.654
We're in the street in broad daylight.

17:56.737 --> 18:00.408
A brawl will bring cops, jail.
Shit we don't have time for.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.831
You're a businessman.
Let's do business.

18:06.914 --> 18:08.874
What's your finder's fee
for tracking down deadbeats?

18:08.958 --> 18:09.959
Eight percent.

18:11.544 --> 18:15.506
She's a P.I., a good one.
She'll do it for five.

18:15.590 --> 18:17.300
The hell I will.

18:20.177 --> 18:22.805
Fine. Five percent.

18:22.888 --> 18:24.307
If we all walk away right now.

18:24.390 --> 18:25.975
You known to deliver?

18:26.058 --> 18:30.396
It's like you said,
all I have is my professional reputation.

18:31.356 --> 18:33.941
You got a deal.
Come on.

18:39.238 --> 18:41.741
Carl Icahn?

18:41.824 --> 18:43.659
I read his book.

18:43.743 --> 18:46.120
I'll text you if I find anything.

18:48.288 --> 18:51.083
It's a long commute home
this time of day.

18:53.043 --> 18:54.962
I'll give you a ride.

18:59.717 --> 19:01.135
I'm not gonna infect you.

19:04.889 --> 19:06.474
I know.

19:10.353 --> 19:11.479
It's the law.

19:16.942 --> 19:18.068
Hold on tight.

19:55.314 --> 19:57.692
So, uh, what's next?

19:59.569 --> 20:02.071
I mean, with Antoine.

20:03.781 --> 20:08.994
I'm gonna do some digging on the Internet.
I'll call you if I find something.

20:20.506 --> 20:21.507
Luke.

20:22.967 --> 20:25.302
- You got a problem with me?
- Depends.

20:25.385 --> 20:28.931
Whether your interest in Jessica
is actually your interest.

20:29.014 --> 20:31.308
Whatever that means,
it's none of your business.

20:31.391 --> 20:32.685
Have you been
approached by a British guy?

20:32.768 --> 20:35.438
- Are you high?
- I wish.

20:36.522 --> 20:40.485
Look, if you got a thing for her, man,
good luck.

20:40.568 --> 20:43.403
Just don't get attached, man.
Trust me.

20:43.488 --> 20:45.823
You got attached?

20:45.906 --> 20:47.658
Again, not your business.

20:47.742 --> 20:49.118
It is if you're gonna hurt her.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.454
I don't think that's possible.

20:51.537 --> 20:54.707
Whatever your issue is,
just don't take it out on her, all right?

20:55.415 --> 20:58.210
She's been through hell
and saved me from the same.

21:01.797 --> 21:06.301
Hell got anything to do with this
Kilgrave I keep hearing about?

21:13.433 --> 21:14.727
Jeri Hogarth's office.

21:14.810 --> 21:16.646
Put Hogarth on.

21:16.729 --> 21:18.523
<i>Hi, Jessica.</i>

21:19.607 --> 21:21.609
Yes, why be polite to a lowly secretary?

21:23.903 --> 21:25.613
Were you just rude to Pam?

21:25.696 --> 21:28.616
I'm rude to everybody.
Did you get Hope's meds?

21:28.699 --> 21:29.867
<i>Pam picked them up.</i>

21:29.950 --> 21:31.869
Yes, Pam is helping with this.

21:31.952 --> 21:35.873
Pam who has been waiting for my divorce
with the patience of a saint.

21:35.956 --> 21:38.793
Pam who I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

21:40.002 --> 21:42.880
Jesus, I didn't ask
for your wedding vows.

21:42.963 --> 21:45.132
Meet me at the prison tomorrow morning.

21:51.221 --> 21:52.515
Did you mean that?

21:57.645 --> 21:58.813
I did.

22:17.039 --> 22:18.541
I want to.

22:18.624 --> 22:21.877
I really, really want to.

22:23.713 --> 22:27.592
But first, the divorce.

22:35.474 --> 22:36.934
I'm Catholic.

23:11.093 --> 23:13.303
Go home, Luke.

23:13.387 --> 23:15.222
I know about Kilgrave.

23:17.725 --> 23:19.309
What do you know?

23:19.393 --> 23:24.231
I know what he did to Malcolm
and to you before that.

23:24.314 --> 23:25.983
God damn it, Malcolm.

23:26.651 --> 23:30.320
You were trying to tell me about him
when you and I were, uh...

23:31.822 --> 23:33.115
Whatever we were doing.

23:36.076 --> 23:38.120
You had no reason to believe me.

23:38.203 --> 23:42.332
So I shut you down.
That's the reason you broke it off.

23:44.543 --> 23:47.087
Don't, that's not the reason.

23:47.171 --> 23:49.423
Then what was it?

23:53.427 --> 23:55.137
Why does it matter?

23:58.057 --> 23:59.809
Maybe I can make it right.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.701
You can't.

24:18.577 --> 24:20.788
You didn't do anything wrong.

24:23.582 --> 24:26.711
It's me. I'm a piece of shit.

24:26.794 --> 24:28.128
Hey, hold on.

24:34.468 --> 24:36.553
You have no idea what I've done.

24:36.636 --> 24:40.725
Doesn't matter.
It was him, not you.

24:42.476 --> 24:43.518
You don't know.

24:43.602 --> 24:45.520
Jessica Jones,

24:45.604 --> 24:51.318
you are a hard-drinking, short-fused,

24:51.401 --> 24:54.947
mess of a woman,

24:55.030 --> 24:57.783
but you are not a piece of shit.

25:21.891 --> 25:23.017
What?

25:24.434 --> 25:26.353
Just...

25:26.436 --> 25:27.938
thinking.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.234
I gotta get up.

25:36.864 --> 25:37.990
If you gotta.

25:55.590 --> 25:58.593
You still going to go after
this Kilgrave guy?

25:58.677 --> 25:59.845
Mmm-hmm.

26:02.222 --> 26:04.224
You don't have to face him alone.

26:07.269 --> 26:08.645
Yeah, I do.

26:12.357 --> 26:13.818
Good for you.

26:20.866 --> 26:22.701
I gotta say something.

26:32.377 --> 26:33.378
It's Antoine.

26:36.631 --> 26:38.300
Good morning!

26:38.383 --> 26:40.135
<i>Yeah, this is Antoine Grier.</i>

26:40.219 --> 26:41.511
<i>I won an Xbox One?</i>

26:41.595 --> 26:44.223
Antoine! Congratulations!

26:44.306 --> 26:46.516
We'll deliver your prize today
at 3:00 p.m.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.852
What's your address?

26:47.935 --> 26:51.856
<i>257 Delancey Street.
It's a BK Express.</i>

26:51.939 --> 26:54.066
Okay, you'll have to be there
to sign for it.

26:54.149 --> 26:55.150
<i>Gracias!</i>

26:57.611 --> 27:00.865
Do Antoine and Serena
have Puerto Rican accents?

27:00.948 --> 27:03.033
No. Why?

27:03.117 --> 27:06.203
Then that's some other guy
calling from Antoine's phone.

27:07.037 --> 27:09.331
If Antoine was bragging about the money
his sister gave him,

27:09.414 --> 27:13.127
I'm afraid your friend Serena
might be out of a brother.

27:13.210 --> 27:15.337
She's not my friend.

27:15.420 --> 27:18.798
I barely know her.
And I never met her brother.

27:19.633 --> 27:22.969
Then, why?

27:23.053 --> 27:24.721
She has something I need.

27:27.599 --> 27:30.978
Proof my wife's death
wasn't an accident.

27:33.730 --> 27:36.901
After Reva died, I went nuts.

27:36.984 --> 27:41.363
I stormed into the MTA
looking for details about the crash.

27:42.822 --> 27:46.368
Serena was an administrator.

27:46.451 --> 27:48.703
She tried to calm me down.

27:48.787 --> 27:52.457
I ended up being dragged out
by eight guards.

27:55.002 --> 27:57.671
So she's seen your strength
and she's taking advantage.

27:57.754 --> 28:00.966
Her proof could be nothing.

28:01.050 --> 28:03.010
I thought the same thing.

28:03.093 --> 28:04.678
So I went through Reva's stuff

28:04.761 --> 28:07.097
that I'd packed away
after she died without looking.

28:08.432 --> 28:11.435
But I found an envelope
with my name on it.

28:11.518 --> 28:13.020
Instructions inside.

28:14.479 --> 28:17.566
Told me to go to a warehouse
on 14th and 8th.

28:19.068 --> 28:21.820
That's the corner where Reva got killed.

28:22.862 --> 28:24.073
So I checked it out.

28:24.156 --> 28:28.285
She said she buried something
when the foundation was being poured.

28:29.619 --> 28:31.455
I dug until I couldn't feel my hands.

28:32.831 --> 28:34.166
There was nothing there.

29:31.181 --> 29:32.349
Take care of her.

29:39.939 --> 29:42.609
What does Serena have?

29:44.069 --> 29:46.780
I won't know until we find Antoine.

29:46.863 --> 29:49.866
A video from the bus?
An eyewitness?

29:49.949 --> 29:53.578
I hand over her brother,
she hands over the proof.

29:55.122 --> 29:59.334
I just hope that guy on the phone
shows up at 3:00 for his prize.

29:59.418 --> 30:00.419
Oh, shit!

30:01.420 --> 30:03.463
The goddamn alarm didn't go off!

30:23.608 --> 30:25.319
- You okay?
- Fine!

30:33.202 --> 30:34.453
I'm taking off, Jones.

30:34.536 --> 30:36.205
I copied the address.

30:36.288 --> 30:39.083
- See you at 3:00.
- Okay.

31:04.399 --> 31:06.151
He seems like an okay guy.

31:06.235 --> 31:08.903
It's not for you to decide
who knows my history.

31:08.987 --> 31:13.117
Just looking out for you, but I...
I take your point.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.202
I went to that group
that you told me about.

31:15.285 --> 31:16.787
The Kilgrave survivors.

31:16.870 --> 31:19.539
It was good, you know,
saying it out loud.

31:19.623 --> 31:22.376
- I prefer repression.
- And self-medication.

31:22.459 --> 31:25.629
Look, I'm not gonna talk about
my shitty story, Malcolm,

31:25.712 --> 31:27.964
because there's always someone
who's had it worse,

31:28.047 --> 31:31.175
someone's life who is ruined worse.

31:31.260 --> 31:32.552
It's not a competition.

31:32.636 --> 31:35.013
Shut up, okay? Just stop talking.

31:41.686 --> 31:44.648
Once you take this,
there's no do-overs.

31:44.731 --> 31:46.400
You'll be sick as shit
for about eight hours,

31:46.483 --> 31:49.819
so I need you to be 1,000% sure.

31:53.198 --> 31:55.450
That's... sure.

31:55.534 --> 31:58.912
Please work fast.
Please work fast.

32:00.247 --> 32:01.967
You're staying?

32:01.998 --> 32:03.458
You're leaving?

32:03.542 --> 32:05.169
Just tell me
if you're gonna stay with Hope.

32:05.252 --> 32:06.253
I wasn't planning on it.

32:06.336 --> 32:08.880
Look, I will get something
on your ex, okay?

32:10.089 --> 32:14.553
I will make her sign those divorce papers
if I have to dangle her off of a ledge.

32:14.636 --> 32:16.305
- Is that what you want to hear?
- Yes.

32:16.388 --> 32:18.140
Then stay with Hope.

32:19.474 --> 32:21.476
Please work fast.

32:35.324 --> 32:36.325
May I help you?

32:36.408 --> 32:38.702
I like your home.
Nicest on the block.

32:38.785 --> 32:39.786
Thanks.

32:39.869 --> 32:44.249
And the neighborhood,
the big trees, grass, birds.

32:44.333 --> 32:47.336
Wish I'd grown up somewhere
excessively normal like this.

32:47.419 --> 32:49.921
I'm sorry, what is it you want?

32:50.004 --> 32:52.632
Yes, I've always been bad at small talk.

32:52.716 --> 32:54.384
I'm used to just saying things
and they happen.

32:54.468 --> 32:56.178
It spoils you.

32:56.261 --> 32:57.762
Well, what a burden.

32:57.846 --> 32:59.889
You have no idea.

32:59.973 --> 33:01.933
Well, I need to go.

33:02.016 --> 33:04.102
I'd like to buy your house.

33:05.854 --> 33:07.146
It's not for sale.

33:07.231 --> 33:10.609
I've done some research.
I believe it's worth just over $600,000.

33:10.692 --> 33:14.404
Like I said, it's not for sale.
Now, move your foot.

33:17.616 --> 33:18.825
You are going to...

33:24.789 --> 33:26.875
I wanna show you something.

33:30.879 --> 33:34.216
This is $1.26 million.

33:36.134 --> 33:40.722
I'd like to give this to you
in exchange for your beautiful home.

33:40.805 --> 33:42.557
- You can't be serious.
- I am.

33:42.641 --> 33:45.227
But you could buy two houses
with this much money.

33:45.310 --> 33:46.895
I know. Exciting, isn't it?

33:47.729 --> 33:50.399
- I mean, is this even legal?
- Completely.

33:50.482 --> 33:52.692
I've had a real estate agreement drawn up.

33:54.361 --> 33:55.654
I'd have to show this to a lawyer.

33:55.737 --> 33:59.324
Mmm, feel free, I want everything
above-board and binding.

33:59.408 --> 34:01.326
Avoid seller's remorse.

34:01.993 --> 34:03.578
There is one condition.

34:03.662 --> 34:07.666
You have to have moved out of here
by the end of day tomorrow...

34:07.749 --> 34:09.251
if you choose to sign.

34:13.422 --> 34:16.341
<i>Some assholes would call Hope selfish,</i>

34:16.425 --> 34:18.592
<i>but she's got nothing on me.</i>

34:19.886 --> 34:22.931
<i>Helping Luke was supposed to make up
for the pain I caused him,</i>

34:24.014 --> 34:27.476
<i>but I'll hurt him worse
if I don't get to Antoine first.</i>

34:30.188 --> 34:31.648
You're early.

34:32.774 --> 34:33.942
So are you.

34:34.859 --> 34:36.527
I'm gonna find the guy
that called Antoine's phone.

34:36.610 --> 34:40.532
He'll be the one having a shit fit
that his Xbox hasn't arrived.

34:41.991 --> 34:43.784
Then the dude's here early, too.

34:52.251 --> 34:54.212
Let me follow him.
You're too close to this.

34:54.295 --> 34:55.589
I'm not sitting this out.

34:58.132 --> 34:59.217
Hey, yo, taxi.

34:59.301 --> 35:00.844
Luke, let me do my job!

35:00.927 --> 35:02.512
Let's go.

35:42.886 --> 35:45.597
I'd say it's a good place
to hold a guy prisoner.

36:37.816 --> 36:39.901
Sweet Christmas.

36:46.408 --> 36:47.992
That's some good herb.

36:48.076 --> 36:50.286
Oh, shit.

36:53.748 --> 36:54.749
I got this.

36:54.833 --> 36:58.545
- Are you sure?
- Sharp teeth. It's kind of my specialty.

36:58.628 --> 37:00.338
Easy. Easy, easy.

37:02.131 --> 37:03.467
Easy.

37:03.550 --> 37:05.760
Easy.

37:05.844 --> 37:08.096
Come on, guys.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

37:08.179 --> 37:10.098
I'm not gonna hurt you.

37:11.850 --> 37:14.728
Hey, yo, Myers! Krueger!

37:14.811 --> 37:17.188
Shut up, man!
Hey, yo, I said shut...

37:18.231 --> 37:19.858
- Where's Antoine?
- Who?

37:19.941 --> 37:22.819
Tell me what you did with Antoine
or I put you through this door.

37:24.362 --> 37:27.782

37:27.866 --> 37:30.952
<i>♪ I pray my dick
Get big as the Eiffel Tower ♪</i>

37:33.913 --> 37:36.458
Antoine Grier,
you're coming with me.

37:41.588 --> 37:44.591
- I know I owe Sirkes.
- And your sister.

37:44.674 --> 37:47.218
- Serena sent you?
- Just keep moving.

37:47.301 --> 37:50.138
I was waiting till
I had this crop on the street.

37:50.221 --> 37:52.599
Go back to her as an entrepreneur.

37:52.682 --> 37:53.725
Tsk.

37:56.269 --> 37:57.687
Ah, shit.

37:58.605 --> 37:59.898
You are a good P.I.

38:00.690 --> 38:03.359
Maybe I'll throw you
some business in the future.

38:03.442 --> 38:05.695
- Pay her.
- How about a new deal?

38:05.779 --> 38:09.115
All this weed is worth three,
four times what he owes you.

38:09.198 --> 38:12.243
Let me keep Antoine,
all of this is yours.

38:12.326 --> 38:13.369
What?

38:13.452 --> 38:15.664
- I don't re-negotiate.
- I'm not gonna hand him over.

38:15.747 --> 38:17.832
Then I'll take both.

38:22.336 --> 38:23.713
Stay away.

38:31.930 --> 38:34.050
- The dogs all right?
- Of course they're okay.

38:34.098 --> 38:35.517
I don't hurt dogs.

38:52.450 --> 38:54.994
Goddamn punk. Disrespect me?

38:56.037 --> 38:57.539
Get out of the way, asshole.

39:25.817 --> 39:27.193
Let's go.

39:53.302 --> 39:56.848
- Serena Grier?
- Oh, my God, Antoine! Oh!

39:56.931 --> 39:58.933
Do you have any idea
how worried I've been?

39:59.017 --> 40:01.728
I was gonna pay everybody back.
I had a plan.

40:01.811 --> 40:04.563
- To steal money from a loan shark?
- No risk, no reward.

40:04.648 --> 40:06.565
- You sound like Dad, you know that?
- Enough!

40:06.650 --> 40:09.110
- Give me whatever you promised Luke.
- Who are you?

40:09.193 --> 40:11.195
The one who brought
your brother home.

40:14.198 --> 40:16.743
Go to my room and wait for me there.

40:18.202 --> 40:19.788
I went to Mr. Cage...

40:19.871 --> 40:22.123
Who hired me.

40:22.206 --> 40:23.291
I'm a P.I.

40:25.126 --> 40:26.127
Come on!

40:36.220 --> 40:39.182
Guess I should get used
to you bailing on me.

40:41.893 --> 40:44.854
I had Antoine in hand.
The priority was getting him home.

40:48.942 --> 40:50.026
That's mine.

40:50.109 --> 40:53.738
Whatever's in that file,
it isn't gonna make things better.

40:53.822 --> 40:55.031
Why do you care?

40:57.241 --> 40:59.828
I know a lot about holding on to shit.

41:01.871 --> 41:03.998
It'll only hurt you
and everyone around you.

41:20.724 --> 41:22.016
Luke...

41:30.399 --> 41:34.028
There's a reason, an explanation...

41:34.112 --> 41:35.238
Charles Wallace.

41:35.321 --> 41:37.448
- What?
- Charles Wallace.

41:38.491 --> 41:40.159
He was the bus driver.

41:43.496 --> 41:44.789
In the accident?

41:44.873 --> 41:48.584
Wasn't an accident.
The asshole was drunk.

41:48.667 --> 41:53.089
He got liquored up, went to work,
and killed my wife.

42:00.388 --> 42:02.223
Luke...

42:02.306 --> 42:04.976
That's...

42:12.233 --> 42:13.484
It's over.

42:14.986 --> 42:16.362
Done.

42:18.489 --> 42:19.783
Right?

42:32.128 --> 42:33.462
It's over.

42:35.173 --> 42:39.803
God forgive me.
He's gonna kill that man.

42:39.886 --> 42:43.222
What do you mean?
Why would you say that?

42:43.306 --> 42:45.266
The MTA covered it up.

42:45.349 --> 42:48.311
Wallace's blood alcohol test
never even made it to the file.

42:49.562 --> 42:51.105
Why the hell would they do that?

42:51.189 --> 42:54.525
Wallace's brother-in-law
ran the claims division.

42:54.608 --> 42:56.986
Charles Wallace is still driving
the same route listed in that file,

42:57.070 --> 42:58.988
like it never happened.

44:08.807 --> 44:11.019
Sorry, but this is the last stop.

44:19.861 --> 44:21.154
You know who I am?

44:23.614 --> 44:26.034
No. No idea.

44:27.952 --> 44:30.079
How about Reva Connors?

44:36.002 --> 44:37.295
You're the husband?

44:37.378 --> 44:40.381
And you're the asshole
who killed my wife.

44:40.464 --> 44:42.800
I'm sorry for what I did.

44:42.884 --> 44:48.139
I've been sober since the accident.
I'm just trying to make things right.

44:56.689 --> 44:58.649
Time's up.

45:09.285 --> 45:12.080
Get up. Go on, get up.
Go, go!

45:12.163 --> 45:13.664
You can't kill him.

45:13.747 --> 45:15.166
The hell I can't.

45:19.795 --> 45:21.255
Run!

45:22.506 --> 45:24.383
Would Reva want you
to become a murderer?

45:24.467 --> 45:27.345
Don't matter.
Reva's dead, and so is her killer.

45:32.725 --> 45:34.268
Charles didn't kill your wife!

45:44.528 --> 45:45.904
I did!

45:48.074 --> 45:49.993
Stay out of it, Jones.

45:50.076 --> 45:51.244
It was me.

45:52.786 --> 45:54.122
I killed Reva.

45:54.205 --> 45:56.165
Bullshit.

45:56.249 --> 46:01.420
Reva was at that warehouse
because Kilgrave and I took her there.

46:02.546 --> 46:04.548
Oh, no way.

46:05.591 --> 46:09.262
Reva had something that he wanted.

46:09.345 --> 46:12.098
He made her tell him where it was.

46:14.058 --> 46:15.643
He made me dig it up...

46:17.645 --> 46:19.522
and then he told me...

46:21.190 --> 46:23.067
He forced me to...

46:26.820 --> 46:29.407
Shut up.

46:35.704 --> 46:37.915
I hit her...

46:37.998 --> 46:39.958
full-strength.

46:40.043 --> 46:42.086
She was dead before
the bus even got there.

46:42.170 --> 46:43.610
The driver swerved to miss her body.

46:54.932 --> 46:56.934
You slept with me.

47:01.355 --> 47:05.151
I didn't plan that.
It just happened.

47:05.234 --> 47:06.527
You made me think...

47:08.362 --> 47:09.655
I could get past it.

47:13.909 --> 47:16.329
Did Kilgrave force you to do that?

47:22.960 --> 47:26.255
You let me be inside you.

47:28.632 --> 47:32.345
You touched me with the same hands
that killed my wife,

47:32.428 --> 47:34.763
while you knew.

47:34.847 --> 47:36.849
I'm so sorry.

47:42.438 --> 47:47.776
If I never found out about Charles,
would you have ever told me the truth?

48:06.670 --> 48:08.088
I was wrong.

48:11.550 --> 48:13.511
You are a piece of shit.

48:38.452 --> 48:42.623
It's not just the things
that he made me do that keep me up.

48:43.832 --> 48:46.752
It's the question of who I am.

48:46.835 --> 48:50.381
I mean, he turned me into
an addict, a liar, a thief.

48:50.464 --> 48:51.882
He did that.

48:53.509 --> 48:57.305
But I don't know
if it was in me to begin with

48:57.388 --> 49:01.642
or... or if it's part of who I am now.

49:10.318 --> 49:11.527
How much longer?

49:11.610 --> 49:13.279
A few more hours.

49:13.362 --> 49:17.991
Collect what you can.
Deliver it to the lab at this address.

49:18.075 --> 49:21.078
If you don't mind my asking,
what do you want with a dead fetus?

49:21.161 --> 49:24.873
I do mind.
Keep this between us.

49:35.759 --> 49:37.220
Birch Street.

49:39.012 --> 49:40.514
Higgins Drive.

49:41.974 --> 49:43.183
Cobalt Lane.

49:45.728 --> 49:46.895
Birch Street.

49:48.856 --> 49:50.358
Higgins Drive.

49:51.775 --> 49:53.361
Cobalt Lane.

49:56.196 --> 49:58.616
- Tell me, are you happy with our deal?
- You bet.

49:58.699 --> 50:01.535
Absolutely. I mean, I didn't think
we'd get everything packed up,

50:01.619 --> 50:03.621
- but the kids made a game of it...
- Leave now.
