07:17.875 --> 07:19.675
Did you smoke?

08:00.708 --> 08:02.308
Morning duckling.

08:02.875 --> 08:05.408
How am I supposed to work
with him screaming non-stop?

08:09.375 --> 08:11.975
Good morning, grumpy.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.975
I'm going to put some Palinca in his milk.

08:14.275 --> 08:15.941
Give him to the gypsies.

08:18.341 --> 08:19.241
Hey!

08:19.608 --> 08:20.441
I'm finished.

08:20.841 --> 08:22.541
- Finished...
- I'm finished!

08:22.641 --> 08:24.808
- You haven't finished. Sit down and eat!
- I'm full!

08:24.908 --> 08:26.675
Easy, easy...

08:28.841 --> 08:30.241
You're going to get it!

08:40.508 --> 08:41.775
I'm almost done.

08:42.575 --> 08:44.308
Take your time and finish.

08:57.541 --> 08:58.941
I'll be back in a minute, yes?

09:01.475 --> 09:02.241
Yes?

10:12.741 --> 10:13.975
I love you, bye.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.441
Will you talk to Yusuf about the heating?

10:18.508 --> 10:20.808
- Are you so scared?
- I'm not scared.

10:21.608 --> 10:22.775
Time to go.

10:23.808 --> 10:24.775
Talk to him!

10:28.341 --> 10:29.575
Funny guy!

11:49.775 --> 11:50.608
What?

13:30.908 --> 13:32.408
Good luck!

18:27.608 --> 18:28.408
What?

18:28.508 --> 18:29.875
Are you friends with that boy?

18:59.416 --> 19:01.549
Why don't you come and ask him yourself?

19:06.149 --> 19:07.549
Flying away?

19:35.016 --> 19:36.216
Bye, duckling.

19:36.249 --> 19:37.149
Bye.

19:39.583 --> 19:41.016
Do you have a lot to do?

19:44.949 --> 19:46.349
Don't stay up too late.

19:56.149 --> 19:59.549
Maybe go talk to mum if you finish before bed...

20:00.983 --> 20:01.549
Okay.

20:03.316 --> 20:04.583
She'd like that...

20:12.049 --> 20:13.116
Sleep well.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.216
Have you heard from dad?

23:14.516 --> 23:15.616
Not yet.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.549
Have you got your hot water bottle?

23:36.049 --> 23:37.483
Enough with the phone.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.383
Just a bit longer.

23:47.016 --> 23:48.016
Goodnight.

31:00.483 --> 31:01.683
What happened?

31:02.183 --> 31:04.916
- Why are you up so early?
- What happened?

31:05.649 --> 31:07.249
- Babies are sleeping...
- Tell me!

31:09.983 --> 31:11.383
There was a little thing with the bike.

31:13.316 --> 31:15.049
It broke down but it's okay.

31:15.683 --> 31:16.583
How much?

31:17.316 --> 31:18.983
I just took it to the garage.

31:21.149 --> 31:22.949
At four in the morning?

31:35.149 --> 31:38.583
It's just some guys.

31:39.683 --> 31:40.916
What guys?

31:43.249 --> 31:45.049
And then Victor gave me a lift home.

31:47.349 --> 31:48.149
Did you smoke?

31:52.583 --> 31:54.349
I guess I'm taking the bus...?

32:09.583 --> 32:11.283
Miri's old enough to walk.

32:11.349 --> 32:12.583
I have time to walk her.

32:12.949 --> 32:13.949
Are you sure?

32:14.683 --> 32:17.049
I don't like her walking alone around here.

32:18.283 --> 32:20.916
We have enough to pay the rent.

32:22.449 --> 32:24.016
How long 'til the bike's fixed?

32:24.916 --> 32:27.016
Tonight... tonight.

32:27.383 --> 32:28.949
What if it's not ready?

32:29.916 --> 32:31.549
They will just lend you another?

32:37.149 --> 32:39.016
You had me worried...

32:51.416 --> 32:53.349
I don't need you to walk with me.

32:54.149 --> 32:55.949
I thought it would be nice.

32:57.016 --> 32:58.249
We can chat.

32:58.649 --> 32:59.983
About what?

33:00.249 --> 33:02.083
Whatever you want.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.216
What is it now?

33:09.183 --> 33:10.016
Come here!

33:10.416 --> 33:12.016
Dad, what are you doing?!

33:12.283 --> 33:13.516
Dad, stop!

33:13.916 --> 33:15.116
What did you do?

33:18.116 --> 33:18.683
Let go of him!

33:27.449 --> 33:28.249
Dad... please!

33:28.516 --> 33:29.616
You don't understand!

33:29.916 --> 33:30.549
What?

33:54.649 --> 33:55.616
Come back!

34:00.016 --> 34:01.583
Come back here right now!

34:02.249 --> 34:03.116
Stop!

34:03.283 --> 34:04.149
Leave me alone!

34:04.483 --> 34:05.416
Stop now!

52:47.199 --> 52:48.199
It's me.

52:48.733 --> 52:49.733
- What's up?

52:50.866 --> 52:52.499
Any word on the bike?

52:54.366 --> 52:55.733
It's fine.

52:56.499 --> 52:58.833
- I have kind of bad news.

52:59.499 --> 53:00.633
Are you okay?

53:00.766 --> 53:05.866
- The lady I was working for today,
she came home early, found Toma...

53:06.366 --> 53:07.466
So what?

53:07.799 --> 53:09.466
You know this...

53:09.699 --> 53:11.733
I'm not allowed to bring the kid to work.

53:14.433 --> 53:16.233
I think she made a complaint.

53:21.233 --> 53:23.433
- I don't know what we're going to do.

53:26.766 --> 53:28.366
- Are you picking up Miri?

53:30.833 --> 53:32.266
I'll try.

53:32.399 --> 53:33.699
- I thought you said you could?

53:34.433 --> 53:35.499
I will!

53:36.299 --> 53:38.199
- You'll be able to work this evening?

53:39.733 --> 53:40.599
- Hello?

53:40.799 --> 53:41.766
Got to run.

53:41.833 --> 53:44.299
- Did you talk about the heating?
- I love you
