MEN SPEAK ITALIAN

01:00.400 --> 01:01.960
Oh, Mr Wingfield.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.840
You're not sneaking off
without saying goodbye, surely?

01:05.840 --> 01:07.480
Sorry, I...
I didn't think anyone was up.

01:07.480 --> 01:10.480
Won't you have some breakfast?
I'd rather get on.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.040
Ah. Would you wait one moment?

01:14.160 --> 01:17.040
Would you mind awfully
posting a letter for me,

01:17.040 --> 01:18.400
once you get to Milan?

01:18.400 --> 01:22.120
Here you are,
this is to cover the cost.  Ah, yes.

01:22.120 --> 01:26.640
Oh, Harrogate, eh?
That's a lovely town.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.080
It is, isn't it? Well...
Wish me luck.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.720
Best of British.

01:36.760 --> 01:39.760
Oh, heavens. Not again.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.720
Wha... Can't you leave us alone?

01:41.720 --> 01:44.800
And a very good morning to you also,
Signora Ainsworth.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.280
This is Signor Ricci,

01:46.280 --> 01:48.560
from the inspectorate
of Industry and Labour.

01:48.560 --> 01:49.960
What is it now?

01:49.960 --> 01:53.800
And this is a letter
that authorises him

01:53.800 --> 01:57.440
to carry out an inspection on the
working conditions on your premises.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.720
At seven o'clock in the morning?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.600
Chi dorme non piglia pesci.

02:44.520 --> 02:48.160
BIRDSONG

03:03.800 --> 03:05.840
It's just batter.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.760
There's nowt queer about that.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.680
I don't care if you got your orders
from the King of Italy himself,

03:15.680 --> 03:18.640
you will NOT open that door.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.760
If my buns don't rise,
there'll be hell to pay. Capisci?

03:53.760 --> 03:56.240
Condizioni anti-igieniche?

03:56.240 --> 03:58.240
Unhygienic conditions?

03:58.240 --> 04:02.280
You could eat your dinner
off Betty's floor!

04:02.280 --> 04:04.000
I didn't write this report.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.280
Well, your signature is all over it.

04:08.280 --> 04:12.040
So... what does it mean?
It means you have 14 days.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.880
To do what?
To make good. Or face closure.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.800
This is ridiculous!
CLATTERING UPSTAIRS

MAN SHOUTING

04:30.600 --> 04:32.120
Where is it?!

04:32.120 --> 04:34.560
Ainsworth! Ainsworth, where are you?

04:34.560 --> 04:36.800
Ainsworth, where is it?!

04:36.800 --> 04:38.560
What on Earth's the matter, man?

04:38.560 --> 04:41.960
You crooks! Where is it?!
Where is what?

04:41.960 --> 04:46.000
Where'd you put it?
Can I help you?  Where'd you put it?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.760
The painting is gone!

04:49.760 --> 04:53.480
Well, don't just stand there!
Go get the goddamn cops!

04:53.480 --> 04:54.880
Right.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.160
And you are sure the painting,
it is stolen?

05:13.160 --> 05:15.440
It didn't get up and walk around
on its own, did it?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.880
Yes, of course I'm sure.
What kind of jerk you take me for?

05:17.880 --> 05:20.840
Have you searched your room, sir?
Are you kidding me?

05:20.840 --> 05:22.600
If I say it is gone,
it is gone, OK?

05:22.600 --> 05:26.280
How can a painting just disappear
from right under your nose?

05:26.280 --> 05:29.800
That's some question, Ainsworth.
How the hell should I know?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.160
I ain't the guy who stole it.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.840
Yet you are "the guy" who was
supposed to be keeping it safe.

05:33.840 --> 05:34.880
Meaning what?

05:34.880 --> 05:38.080
Meaning whatever you choose
to make of it, Mr Turner.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.320
We should all try and stay calm.
Yes. What would you advise, Carlo?

05:41.320 --> 05:44.400
To do what Mr Turner requested.
Thank you.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.800
Send for the police. Subito.
Oh, good grief...

05:47.800 --> 05:49.400
Ferma!

05:49.400 --> 05:51.960
No-one is going anywhere here.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.120
Let's be clear.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.920
From now on,
nobody is going back to their rooms.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.160
That's an order.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.040
You mean we have to stay here?
Yes.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.040
In our nightclothes?
Exactly.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.480
Danioni's right.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.760
That way we can be sure
no-one is up to any shenanigans.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.040
What exactly are you insinuating?

06:11.040 --> 06:13.120
No-one is insinuating anything,
Lady Latchmere.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.520
Is everyone present?

06:15.520 --> 06:18.640
The Wingfields have
yet to make an appearance.  Ah!

06:18.640 --> 06:21.920
Mr Wingfield left early
this morning.  Did he now?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.600
Yes. To play in a tennis tournament.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.640
He said he'd be back
within the week.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.200
Maybe he ain't coming back.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.040
His wife's still here.
You're sure of that, are you?

06:30.040 --> 06:33.480
I saw her last night, Jack.
Just before I went to bed.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.520
Really.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.800
Perhaps... Alice, you could go
and check on Mrs Wingfield.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.600
And Constance, would you
mind bringing Billy upstairs?

06:45.600 --> 06:47.440
We could send him
to the police station.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.280
And everybody else, perhaps
you'd like a bit of breakfast.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.440
It might improve your moods.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.960
Mr Turner, please.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.280
What's happening, then?

07:00.280 --> 07:02.160
Mrs Ainsworth says
we're to set breakfast.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.880
What, for everyone?
They're all up.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.560
I'm not surprised with all
the hullabaloo.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.760
God, the sound of that man's voice!
Dear me, enough to wake the dead.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.080
Er, Paola, breakfast.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.440
Where have you been?
Just out.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.440
You're wanted.
Who's asking?

07:17.440 --> 07:20.480
Mrs Ainsworth. She's talking
about calling the police.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.920
The police? What for?

07:22.920 --> 07:24.960
The painting's gone missing.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.400
That's got nowt to do with me.
No-one says it has, Billy.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.480
She just wants them
to search the hotel.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.600
Stop worrying, you daft apeth.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.240
You're to fetch the police,
not hand yourself in.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.400
Here he is, Mrs Ainsworth.
Thank you, Constance.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.200
Billy, we need you to run
an errand into town.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.640
Signor Danioni will tell you
exactly where to go.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.720
This is William Scanlon?
Yes.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.120
Yes. This is Billy.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.560
Hi, Billy.
Sir.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.720
This is the boy who stole
the bicycle.  Wha...?

08:11.960 --> 08:14.680
I only meant to borrow it, sir.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.160
Sorry, I cannot hear.
I only meant to borrow it.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.640
Oh, I see. Sure.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.080
A known associate
with criminal elements, huh?

08:24.080 --> 08:27.040
That's what he is.  No...
He cannot go anywhere...

08:27.040 --> 08:28.600
No, you don't! Come here, kid!

08:28.600 --> 08:30.160
Get me the key to the outhouse.
Shut up!

08:30.160 --> 08:33.560
We'll lock him up in there.
SHOUTING UPSTAIRS

08:33.560 --> 08:35.040
Billy!

08:35.040 --> 08:38.760
Quit struggling!
Cecil, is this entirely necessary?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.640
The guilty flee
when no man pursueth.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.680
Francesco, you go to the police.

08:42.680 --> 08:45.360
Please, be gentle with him!
Mrs Ainsworth! What's he done?

08:45.360 --> 08:47.760
Betty, let me deal with this. OK?

08:47.760 --> 08:50.800
What's...?  Let me take care of this.
Mr Turner!

08:52.040 --> 08:53.760
Let me out!

08:53.760 --> 08:55.440
BILLY SHOUTS
Shut up!

08:55.440 --> 08:58.280
I can't breathe!
Mrs Ainsworth!

08:58.280 --> 09:00.040
Blighter's got
a pair of lungs on him.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.440
Yeah, and a kick like a mule.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.280
Please!
The boy's in distress.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.560
Panicking, more likely.
Please! It hurts!

09:05.560 --> 09:07.960
Please, can I get Nish
just to have a look at him?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.520
Don't be so bloody feeble.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.360
I've got a pain in me side.
Please, it hurts!

09:12.360 --> 09:13.800
I can't breathe!

09:13.800 --> 09:18.080
Oh, for God's sake, all right.
Be quick about it.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.520
His breathing is certainly laboured.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.080
Can you give him something?

09:27.080 --> 09:29.960
Perhaps a sedative to calm him down,
ease the constriction.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.200
I don't want nowt like that.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.680
Maybe something for the pain, then.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.680
I don't have anything with me.

09:36.680 --> 09:40.000
Ah.
I have some aspirin in my office.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.120
I'll run and get it.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.720
DOOR LOCKS

09:50.720 --> 09:53.320
Lady Latchmere's bedroom.
The pamphlets?

09:53.320 --> 09:55.480
Under the bed.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.880
Are you mad?  Thought it'd be
the last place anyone would look.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.480
The police will find them!

10:00.480 --> 10:02.800
The keys are in me room.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.440
I never got a chance
to put 'em back.

10:09.360 --> 10:12.400
Well, let's hope that the police
can get to the bottom of this.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.240
I... I said...
I heard what you said.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.480
What's the matter?

10:16.480 --> 10:18.640
Stay away from me.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.680
Darling, there's no point
taking this out on me.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.800
You said yourself,

10:23.800 --> 10:26.480
you didn't know the value
of the painting until recently.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.720
Darling?

10:27.720 --> 10:30.600
Really, if either of us
should be upset, it should be me.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.760
This sort of incident
could be ruinous for the hotel.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.640
You really have no idea, do you?

11:04.160 --> 11:07.040
Avete parlato con Ottonello?
Si. Sta arrivando.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.920
Avete detto
tutto quello che serve.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.840
Lo lascio fare a voi.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.280
Sotto il letto, hai detto?
Si.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.640
What do you mean,

11:35.640 --> 11:37.920
you saw the Wingfield woman
before you went to bed?

11:37.920 --> 11:40.000
Exactly what I said.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.440
I told you to stay put.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.200
You know I don't like to be told.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.440
Thank you.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.160
Why don't you cut the crap,
Claudine?

11:56.160 --> 11:58.520
What crap is that, Jack?

11:58.520 --> 12:00.120
This whole goddamn
Queen of Sheba act.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.160
We both know you came from nothing.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.160
Hey, don't you DARE...
walk away from me.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.640
Or else?

12:09.920 --> 12:11.440
Or else.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.760
Take your damn hand off me.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.520
You just back me up, OK?

12:18.560 --> 12:22.040
Whatever I say, all right?

12:23.080 --> 12:25.080
Whatever you say, Jack.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.840
Lover's tiff?

12:41.400 --> 12:43.440
Ha. It looks that way.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.760
Keeping their story straight.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.400
If you say so.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.160
Have you spoken to Mrs Turner?

12:53.160 --> 12:54.960
No, I've only just been woken up.

12:54.960 --> 13:00.480
But... you did see her last night.
Just before bed.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.240
I don't recall.

13:03.800 --> 13:07.520
Mrs Wingfield,
I don't wish to alarm you,

13:07.520 --> 13:11.360
but, er, the coincidence between
your husband's departure

13:11.360 --> 13:13.600
and the disappearance
of the painting

13:13.600 --> 13:15.600
has already been commented upon.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.640
What are you saying?

13:18.640 --> 13:20.840
Oh, nothing, my dear lady.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.160
I merely suggest that,

13:23.160 --> 13:27.440
if you have any information
that might help us establish

13:27.440 --> 13:30.200
the sequence and timing of events,

13:30.200 --> 13:32.680
you would be wise to share it.

13:33.960 --> 13:37.920
I would hate to see a celebrated
sportsman like your husband

13:37.920 --> 13:41.480
dragged into
a murky affair like this.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.400
With all the attendant publicity.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.880
Er,
breakfast is ready when you are.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.640
Excellent.

13:53.640 --> 13:57.480
I'm telling the guests
to gather in the dining room.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.040
Of course, my dear.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.960
Dreadful business.
Quite so.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.120
I have to say, you're looking
remarkably calm, Cecil.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.920
Well, it doesn't do
to lose one's cool.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.440
Do you really think
it's been stolen?

14:20.440 --> 14:24.040
I'm not sure any of us knows
quite what to believe, Julia.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.920
Or who to believe,
more to the point.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.360
That directed at me?

14:30.360 --> 14:32.840
Your surmise is correct.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.280
You're calling me a liar.

14:34.280 --> 14:37.040
I'm saying you're being a trifle
economical with the truth.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.720
Cecil...
OK!

14:38.720 --> 14:41.000
Come on, then, Ainsworth,
out with it.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.240
I rather think the onus is on you,
old boy.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.760
To tell us what you know.
Fine.

14:45.760 --> 14:49.240
The painting was definitely in the
crate when you handed it over to me.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.280
I watched you and Francesco
pack it away,

14:51.280 --> 14:52.840
nail it shut with my own eyes.

14:52.840 --> 14:57.000
Hmm. But what I can't help wondering
is why you were so keen

14:57.000 --> 14:59.320
for the exchange
to take place last night.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.520
Well, after you insisted
on showing it to everybody,

15:01.520 --> 15:04.800
I felt I was better equipped
to keep it safe than you.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.720
I'm quite sure, Mr Turner,
you did what you thought was right.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.280
I left Claudine with the necessary
means to guard the painting

15:10.280 --> 15:12.600
while I came downstairs
to finish my business with you.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.920
I went back to my room around 11

15:13.920 --> 15:17.000
and either Claudine or myself were
with the painting the whole time

15:17.000 --> 15:19.520
until I woke up this morning
and discovered it was gone.

15:19.520 --> 15:23.000
What? Just disappeared
in a puff of smoke.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.240
Oh, that's very cute, Ainsworth.
I don't believe in magic.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.840
Neither do I.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.520
So what do you think happened to it,
then?

15:30.520 --> 15:35.040
Like I said, I think Mr Turner
hasn't told us the whole truth

15:35.040 --> 15:36.880
to cover up his negligence.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.440
Darling, really,
is this the time or the place?

15:39.440 --> 15:41.040
You'd better be able
to back that up.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.640
Oh, I'm sure your wife can.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.120
Isn't that right, Mrs Turner?

15:48.240 --> 15:49.560
Or perhaps I should ask

15:49.560 --> 15:51.200
Mrs Wingfield
to corroborate instead.

15:51.200 --> 15:55.000
After all, I distinctly heard you
say you spoke to her

15:55.000 --> 15:56.640
just before you went to bed.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.480
I may have left the room.
Only for a short while.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.480
Claudine!
What, Jack? It's the truth.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.720
Now we're getting to it.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.760
I asked her
to meet me in the bathroom.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.680
Whatever for?

16:11.680 --> 16:14.520
To help her get ready for bed,
honey.

16:14.520 --> 16:18.920
And how long did this rendezvous
between you lovely ladies last?

16:18.920 --> 16:21.760
About... 20 minutes?

16:21.760 --> 16:25.720
In which time Mrs Turner
was away from the painting

16:25.720 --> 16:30.240
and you, Mrs Wingfield,
were away from your husband.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.280
I can't deny it. But someone must
have gotten the key,

16:35.280 --> 16:37.240
because that door
was locked when I left it.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.440
Looking for some peace and quiet?

16:52.440 --> 16:55.400
Something like that.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.440
I don't blame you.
It's pretty poisonous in there.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.600
I thought that my father
and Jack Turner

17:00.600 --> 17:01.960
were about to come to blows.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.280
You all right?

17:11.320 --> 17:14.040
Come on, Nish, what's wrong?

17:15.920 --> 17:17.720
For heaven's sake,
you saved my life.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.360
We're not to have secrets
from one another, are we?

17:22.280 --> 17:24.360
I've been a bloody fool.

17:24.360 --> 17:26.480
All right, no change there, then.

17:26.480 --> 17:30.600
I'm serious, Lucian.
I'm in a bit of a jam.

17:31.720 --> 17:36.080
Right. Well, then...
let me help you out of it.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.400
I'm not sure there's
anything to be done about it.

17:40.400 --> 17:44.640
CARS APPROACHING

17:54.240 --> 17:58.760
DRAMATIC MUSIC

18:17.120 --> 18:20.960
The police are here.
Oh, at last.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.400
Erm, excuse me.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.680
If I could have your
attention for a moment.

18:25.680 --> 18:31.040
Count Albani, perhaps you would
translate for our benefit.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.920
Of course.
Thank you.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.040
Prego.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.840
Signore e signori, buongiorno.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.160
Buongiorno.
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.040
Sono l'Ispettore capo
Giovanni Ottonello,

18:47.040 --> 18:48.640
della polizia municipale.

18:48.640 --> 18:53.400
I'm Inspector Giovanni Ottonello,
from the municipal police.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.840
Io e i miei uomini siamo
venuti qua per perquisire

18:56.840 --> 18:59.320
l'albergo e le vostre camere.

18:59.320 --> 19:03.560
My men and I are here to search
the hotel and your rooms.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.960
Good.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.400
Voglio la vostra
totale collaborazione.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.640
And I request
your total cooperation.

19:13.160 --> 19:16.480
Molto bene.
Very well.

19:16.480 --> 19:21.680
Listen, I'm sure this is nothing
to worry about for you fine people.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.080
Yeah?

19:25.400 --> 19:28.520
Tu e tu, chiudi la finestra.
Tu e tu, con me.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.320
We have to talk later.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.840
Er, Mama?
Yes?

19:38.160 --> 19:41.480
What is it, darling?
We have a problem.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.040
How could you be so foolish!

19:46.040 --> 19:49.320
Nish wasn't to know that he'd hide
them under Lady Latchmere's bed.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.360
I mean, both of you.
What were you thinking,

19:51.360 --> 19:54.360
sneaking about at some
secret Socialist pow-wow?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.760
I was taking interest
in local politics on the off-chance

19:56.760 --> 19:59.200
there was something
I could feel passionate about it.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.160
Luciano...
Please, Mrs Ainsworth,

20:01.160 --> 20:03.840
Lucian didn't know anything
about the pamphlets.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.680
It's entirely my fault.
Don't listen to him.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.080
I can only apologise for all
the difficulties I've caused,

20:08.080 --> 20:10.440
after all the kindness
you've shown me.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.160
Well, let's not bicker
about how we got into this mess.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.440
Let's just find a way out of it.
Can't we just retrieve them?

20:16.440 --> 20:19.200
Darling, they're already
looking for the painting now.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.280
And the police are everywhere.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.600
Is there any chance
that they just find the painting

20:24.600 --> 20:27.280
and forget about the rest?
Er, well, my money's on the culprit

20:27.280 --> 20:29.080
already having scarpered,
I'm afraid.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.720
I saw Wingfield skulking around

20:30.720 --> 20:32.920
in the most suspicious manner
last night.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.760
So why don't we just tell the truth?

20:34.760 --> 20:37.160
Because Danioni is looking
for any pretext he can find

20:37.160 --> 20:39.120
to shut down the hotel.

20:39.120 --> 20:42.880
I'll take the fall.
Tell them I acted alone.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.360
Nish, at best, you'll be deported.
At worst, jail.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.120
There's nothing else for it.
Billy will have to take the fall.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.240
Alice!

20:51.240 --> 20:54.320
It was his stupid idea to put them
there in the first place.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.520
I need to forewarn Lady Latchmere.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.840
She will not want her name
dragged into all of this mess.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.680
SHE SIGHS
Darling...

21:03.680 --> 21:06.200
Mother!

21:12.160 --> 21:13.600
Mother...

21:16.200 --> 21:18.880
Mother! Mother!

21:18.880 --> 21:20.320
Yes.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.960
You know it makes sense.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.320
Betty would never forgive us.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.120
Si, signore.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.880
He's a juvenile. They'll
almost certainly go easy on him.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.120
We don't know that.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.440
Well, maybe he deserves
what's coming to him.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.760
Nish says he has the spare keys
to every room in the hotel

21:35.760 --> 21:38.840
stashed in his bedroom.  Oh, darling,
we can't throw him to the wolves.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.040
I don't see what other option
we have.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.840
We'll have to get him a lawyer.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.440
Oh, well, then, I'll speak to Daddy!
Has he said anything to you?

21:45.440 --> 21:47.080
Billy?
No, your father.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.240
I haven't spoken a word to him
all day. Why do you ask?

21:49.240 --> 21:51.200
He's just behaving very oddly,
that's all.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.760
Lady Latchmere?
Mm?

21:52.760 --> 21:55.600
Might I have a quick word with you?
With me?  Outside.

22:01.520 --> 22:05.000
Scusi.  Lei ha bisogno di respirare.
Subito, subito.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.360
Please.
It's a matter of some delicacy.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.840
Then you must come out with it
straight away, my dear.

22:13.520 --> 22:17.920
It seems that the search
of the hotel may turn out

22:17.920 --> 22:20.640
some material
of a decidedly political nature,

22:20.640 --> 22:23.760
hidden under your bed.
Under my bed?!

22:23.760 --> 22:26.960
I'm afraid so.
What kind of materials?

22:27.960 --> 22:29.800
Pamphlets, to be exact.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.320
What do these pamphlets say?

22:34.960 --> 22:39.720
They express derogatory sentiments
about a certain Signor Mussolini.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.120
SHE LAUGHS
How simply splendid!

22:43.720 --> 22:46.000
Who is the subversive in our midst?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.480
I'm not at liberty to say,
for fear of incriminating them.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.400
Then I shall claim ownership of them
myself.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.680
What? Is that wise?

22:55.680 --> 22:57.680
Let them do their worst.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.160
One look at that awful
strutting peacock Mussolini

23:01.160 --> 23:04.320
and you can tell that he's a thug.
I simply cannot abide a bully.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.800
I couldn't agree more.
Herbert, Lord Latchmere,

23:06.800 --> 23:09.400
he bullied my darling Ernest
terribly.

23:09.400 --> 23:13.400
He threatened to disown him if
he didn't sign up and do his duty.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.400
I understand. Cecil was very
coercive with Lucian as well.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.840
Was he?
Those poor boys.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.280
I only wish
that I'd stood up to him more

23:22.280 --> 23:24.240
on Ernest's behalf.

23:24.240 --> 23:27.600
I haven't been able to speak to him
since it happened, and I'm...

23:27.600 --> 23:30.120
actually not sure that I ever will.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.800
Now, my dear. You must run along.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.080
You have a lot
of very important things to do.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.560
Yes, respirate.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.960
Allora? Qualcosa.
Niente.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.360
Sicuro?
Guarda tu stesso.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.680
Any luck?

24:34.680 --> 24:35.880
Fagli vedere.

24:38.240 --> 24:42.200
What is this?  These were
found in William Scanlon's room.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.760
Keys? What do I want with keys?

24:43.760 --> 24:46.280
Is there any sign of the painting,
man?!

24:46.280 --> 24:48.560
Vuole sapere se hai
trovato il dipinto.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.840
No.

24:49.840 --> 24:52.560
No?
No.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.600
What kind of circus
are you running here?

24:54.600 --> 24:56.400
This would never happen in England!

25:22.200 --> 25:25.840
Billy... What have you done?
I haven't done nowt.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.760
Here. Get some of this down you.
I'm not hungry.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.960
You need to keep your strength up.
I said I'm not hungry, Mam.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.440
How long am I gonna be
cooped up in here for?

25:34.440 --> 25:36.240
I don't know, Billy.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.080
It were only a bike,
for Christ's sake.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.560
I was gonna take it back.

25:40.560 --> 25:43.000
They're not bothered
about a stupid bike.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
What, then?
The painting!

25:46.000 --> 25:47.800
What on Earth's
that got to do with me?

25:47.800 --> 25:50.880
They're saying someone must have
taken it from Mr Turner's bedroom.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.240
Right. And?
And...

25:53.240 --> 25:57.440
they found the spare keys
hidden in your room.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.440
Oh, Billy!

26:00.440 --> 26:03.280
It's not what you think it is, Mam,
I...

26:03.280 --> 26:05.800
I don't know nothing
about that painting.

26:05.800 --> 26:09.320
I swear on my brothers' graves.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.560
I swear.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.720
SHE TUTS

26:14.720 --> 26:16.280
I believe you.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.920
Thousands wouldn't.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.360
What about those keys, then?

26:22.360 --> 26:24.000
I just forgot to put 'em back.

26:25.480 --> 26:28.560
I were doing a favour for someone.
Who?

26:30.520 --> 26:32.200
I'm not snitching.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.320
SHE SIGHS

27:01.280 --> 27:02.760
Che bella donna.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.520
You must excuse all
the inconvenience, Count Albani.

27:11.520 --> 27:15.040
Oh, no. Actually, it is I who should
be begging your forgiveness.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.840
For my countrymen.
And their rough and criminal ways.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.400
Well, we are very grateful
for your help.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.040
And for your excellent English.
Thank you.

27:23.040 --> 27:26.680
Yet...
Roberto speaks so little of it.

27:28.560 --> 27:32.120
Oh, yes. He's young and arrogant.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.520
Stiamo parlando di te.
Ah?

27:35.520 --> 27:39.480
He thinks there is nothing
he can learn from me.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.080
Perhaps I could give it a try.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.360
To teach him English?
Mm.

27:45.360 --> 27:48.200
What an excellent notion.
Mm.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.160
Just the basics.
Enough so he can speak for himself.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.320
We are at your disposal.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.120
Wonderful. Constance?

28:01.840 --> 28:04.040
Oh! Grazie.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.680
Sei veramente bella oggi, Constance.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.360
Sta a te.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.960
Signor Danioni, any news?

28:45.960 --> 28:48.160
Sorry, Signora,
we have to wait a little longer.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.720
Vieni con me.
But why?

28:53.920 --> 28:57.080
He seems to be enjoying himself.
Directing the operations.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.400
Making threats, you mean.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.520
You speak with great feeling.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.960
I loathe people who seek to take
advantage of others' misfortune.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.280
Is he trying
to take advantage of you?

29:09.400 --> 29:11.480
My dear Mrs Ainsworth,

29:11.480 --> 29:13.360
it is an insult to our friendship

29:13.360 --> 29:15.800
that you should choose
not to confide in me.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.360
He's threatening
to close down the hotel.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.120
He arrived at seven o'clock this
morning with a health inspector,

29:22.120 --> 29:24.280
and the report says

29:24.280 --> 29:28.520
that we are preparing food
in unhygienic conditions.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.520
Absurd.
That's exactly what I said to him.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.920
All right. Do not distress yourself.

29:35.920 --> 29:39.280
Where there is a problem,
there's always a solution.

29:39.280 --> 29:42.360
But how do I solve a problem
that doesn't exist?

29:42.360 --> 29:43.800
Hmm.

29:43.800 --> 29:47.120
But it is certainly not this problem
he wishes you to address.

29:50.280 --> 29:53.600
There is some other issue...

29:53.600 --> 29:56.720
between you and Mr Danioni
that you're not disclosing.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.120
I will speak to him.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.960
Thank you. Thank you so much.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.000
I hope I haven't caused a problem.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.080
Honey, you aren't the problem.

30:27.080 --> 30:30.000
I'd just hate to be the source
of friction in your relationship,

30:30.000 --> 30:33.120
when you've done so much to help
smooth out the bumps in mine.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.080
So you did...
smooth out the bumps, then.

30:38.360 --> 30:41.760
Yes. Twice, in fact.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.360
SHE LAUGHS

30:43.360 --> 30:46.600
God!

30:46.600 --> 30:48.400
Sorry!

30:50.160 --> 30:52.080
I don't quite know
what's come over me!

30:52.080 --> 30:54.560
You're like a new woman
this morning!

30:54.560 --> 30:56.880
BOTH LAUGHING

30:59.080 --> 31:00.400
Ooh!

31:10.800 --> 31:13.200
The search turned up nothing,
then.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.840
Vuole sapere se avete
trovato qualcosa.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.560
Niente.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.760
Nothing at all?

31:20.760 --> 31:23.080
No hidden surprises, Signora.

31:24.240 --> 31:27.520
Your guests are...
Come si dice? ..without sin.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.840
Are you saying you have no clue

31:29.840 --> 31:32.320
how that painting was removed
from Mr Turner's room?

31:32.320 --> 31:35.360
There is no trace.
What about fingerprints?

31:35.360 --> 31:38.880
You mean the handle?
Yes, of course I mean the handle.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.000
It is wiped clean.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.800
So, what next?

31:45.840 --> 31:48.600
We take the boy for questioning
and we will make him confess.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.880
Well, he'll have to have
a lawyer with him.  All right.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.560
I've already sent for Bruzzone.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.920
How much longer will this go on?

32:21.920 --> 32:23.600
This?

32:23.600 --> 32:27.760
No.
This whole... situation.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.600
Er... I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe until they find the painting.

32:31.600 --> 32:35.320
Maybe until the search is concluded.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.800
Whichever one is sooner.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.720
Well, I'm awfully bored.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.720
I think I may have to move soon.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.000
If you could just...

32:51.000 --> 32:53.520
Please? For a moment longer?

32:56.640 --> 32:58.280
Oh, darling, there you are.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.960
Lucian asked if he could draw me.
How lovely.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.120
Oh. I don't think that's your best.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.320
No, well, apparently
there is something about Rose

33:11.320 --> 33:14.000
that I find difficult to capture.

33:15.920 --> 33:19.080
Mama will be wondering where I am.
Of course.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.520
Right.
Darling, darling...

33:25.880 --> 33:27.560
I thought you'd like to know.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.440
The search has turned up nothing.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.520
Absolutely nothing at all?
Not a shred.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.560
My God! That's such a relief.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.960
Where on Earth are they, then?

33:38.960 --> 33:41.080
I don't know.
But they're not in the hotel.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.360
You know, I am sorry to have
put you through all of this.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.000
I'm sorry too.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
For what?

33:52.320 --> 33:53.680
If you've ever felt coerced.

33:55.480 --> 33:59.200
I know
this will take the time it takes.

34:11.240 --> 34:14.040
Signor Bruzzone, I presume.
Si.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.960
This is going to be Billy's lawyer.
And this is?

34:15.960 --> 34:18.680
Gianluca Bruzzone, Signore.
My father asked me to come.

34:18.680 --> 34:20.440
In case there is translation needed.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.560
How fortunate
that you speak English.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.800
Forgive me, it is not well-used.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.000
CAR STARTS

34:27.000 --> 34:29.640
I will accompany them,
to help instruct Mr Bruzzone.

34:29.640 --> 34:31.360
Thank you, Carlo.
I'll go too.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.320
To make sure Billy's all right.
Yes.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.840
I'll come with you.
Keep you company.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.280
We'll have him back in no time.
I promise you, Betty.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.640
This is just a dreadful mistake.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.160
What utter tripe!
Cecil!

35:09.160 --> 35:11.720
You got something else to say,
Ainsworth?  It's balderdash!

35:11.720 --> 35:13.200
What is?

35:13.200 --> 35:16.600
The idea that little Billy Scanlon
is some kind of criminal mastermind.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.160
He and his peasant friends.
It's frankly incredible.

35:19.160 --> 35:22.560
Well, from where I'm standing,
it's the only credible explanation.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.760
Not quite, old boy.
Oh!  Cecil!

35:25.760 --> 35:28.400
You have another one?
I rather think I do.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.440
Well, enlighten us, then.

35:30.440 --> 35:34.160
You arranged for the painting
to be stolen yourself, Jack.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.400
I don't know how, but I do know why.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.280
To cheat me
out of my share of the sale price.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.920
Say that again and I'll kill you.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.240
Please, gentlemen. Stop!

35:44.240 --> 35:46.520
Don't expect to see a red cent
of your 50,000 back.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.840
Call it an insurance payment.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.440
It's not worth a tenth of that.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.640
CECIL SCOFFS
What?

35:53.640 --> 35:56.560
An authentic Rubens?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.440
You'll hear from my lawyers.
You'll hear from mine first.

36:02.440 --> 36:05.600
Cecil, really...
Come on, Claudine.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.920
I said, come on, Claudine.
We're goin'.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.360
I'm not going anywhere with you.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.880
For Christ's sake! Claudine!

36:16.000 --> 36:18.160
Claudine!
Don't touch me!

36:20.720 --> 36:22.440
Go back to your wife, Jack.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.160
You stupid whore.

36:26.160 --> 36:28.520
Who the hell here
is gonna pay for YOU?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.320
I've got my own money.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.480
You're a n...

36:36.000 --> 36:37.240
Trash.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.160
Aren't you missing a word, Jack?

36:42.520 --> 36:45.600
Her value doesn't decrease

36:45.600 --> 36:48.840
because of your inability
to notice it.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.960
A gentleman
is defined by his behaviour,

36:51.960 --> 36:54.160
and yours, sir,
is absolutely monstrous.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.600
Francesco,
help Mr Turner pack his bags.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.960
JACK SCOFFS

37:03.960 --> 37:06.800
You watch your back, Ainsworth.
This ain't over.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.000
And be sure to see him
off the premises.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.560
Far from over!

37:11.840 --> 37:13.720
Oh, I think you'll find it is.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.440
My dear...
Thank you.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.720
CHUCKLING

38:02.720 --> 38:06.400
Vedo che sapete apprezzare le cose
belle della vita, Signor Danioni.

38:06.400 --> 38:10.520
Uh-huh. Raramente li ho trovati
questi. Dove li avete presi?

38:10.520 --> 38:15.000
A Londra.  Siete un grande amante
degli Inglesi, vero.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.040
Voi no?

38:19.600 --> 38:23.920
Eppure vi siete preso la
briga di imparare la loro lingua.

38:23.920 --> 38:24.960
C'e stato un momento

38:24.960 --> 38:26.800
in cui ho pensato di andare
in America, ma poi.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.720
Then you should practise more.

38:31.720 --> 38:35.240
Specially with the way things
are going around here.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.320
Stavo pensando che...

38:43.320 --> 38:45.800
No, no, no. In English, please.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.840
What do you think,

38:50.840 --> 38:53.000
would I like it in England?
CHUCKLES

38:53.000 --> 38:55.200
The people and the weather
are too cold

38:55.200 --> 38:57.120
for a man of your sensibilities.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.680
Although the women can be warmer.
Oh, yeah?

39:01.680 --> 39:05.960
There is something in their culture
that an Italian may admire.

39:05.960 --> 39:10.600
They have few of the superstitions
that holds our people in their grip.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.960
Empirismo Inglese.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.560
E naturalmente amano l'Italia.

39:16.560 --> 39:18.600
Piu di molti meridionali.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.280
Maledetti terroni.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.040
Perche volete espellere gli inglesi
da Portofino?

39:27.480 --> 39:29.080
Chi dice che voglio farlo?

39:29.080 --> 39:31.560
Non avete minacciato
di chiudere l'albergo?

39:32.800 --> 39:34.960
No. Non io.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.480
I am relieved to hear it.

39:39.480 --> 39:44.560
Anyway, I have made a recommendation
to Senator Cavanna to stay there.

39:53.200 --> 39:57.080
Er... I think perhaps there has been
a misunderstanding here.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.280
Perhaps.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.920
Yeah.

40:02.920 --> 40:08.280
Actually...
please tell Signora Ainsworth...

40:10.440 --> 40:12.840
..this impertinence...

40:14.800 --> 40:17.720
..it has been consigned
where it belongs.

40:17.720 --> 40:20.040
Why don't you come
and tell yourself?

40:20.040 --> 40:23.680
I'm sure she will be delighted
to hear it.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.120
Sure.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.400
Arrivederci.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.280
Arrivederci.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.320
Here he comes.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.800
How's Billy?

40:48.800 --> 40:50.880
He's scared.

40:50.880 --> 40:53.760
But my father will do his best
to protect him.

40:53.760 --> 40:57.920
I come to apologise.
I have put you in danger.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.600
And the people we most care about.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.960
I could not know the hotel...
That the hotel would be searched.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.400
I will return tonight.
To take back the pamphlets.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.120
I don't have them.
Then who has?

41:13.120 --> 41:16.320
We don't know.
So I think I ought to tell Billy

41:16.320 --> 41:18.960
they're not where he said
he'd hidden them.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.320
My father will give him a message.
You will find him inside.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.440
You still going?

41:39.440 --> 41:41.960
Tomorrow. Perhaps the day after.

41:43.120 --> 41:44.400
I must.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.920
Then addio.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.000
Arrivederci.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.440
Till we meet again.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.960
Are they worth it?

42:01.040 --> 42:02.600
Hmm?

42:02.600 --> 42:04.560
Worth turning your back
on your family.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.400
On your... your friends.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.520
Worth putting yourself in danger.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.040
You think they're a joke.

42:13.040 --> 42:16.440
Strutting like cockerels
in their ridiculous uniforms.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.480
But these are people who seek
to exploit the worst in us.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.280
Our greed. Our selfishness.
Our capacity to hate.

42:25.320 --> 42:27.440
They care nothing
for what makes us individuals.

42:27.440 --> 42:30.080
Different, uniquely lovable, human.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.560
They only understand
the mentality of the mob.

42:37.400 --> 42:41.160
There's no place
in their world for people like us.

43:05.200 --> 43:08.120
I am grateful to you,
Signor Danioni.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.320
I feel very relieved.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.840
I'm afraid I can't offer you
anything to eat,

43:14.840 --> 43:17.400
because poor Betty is distraught

43:17.400 --> 43:19.800
and she's no longer able
to carry out her duties.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.680
So I've had to close the kitchen.

43:21.680 --> 43:24.880
However, I'm sure my husband
would be only too happy

43:24.880 --> 43:26.720
to offer you a drink
on the terrace.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.520
Of course.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.200
SHE EXHALES

43:42.200 --> 43:44.280
I feel like a weight
has been lifted.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.960
HE CHUCKLES
And I'm happy for you.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.440
I must go and tell Betty
the good news.

43:49.440 --> 43:50.800
Mrs Ainsworth...

43:50.800 --> 43:52.880
Oh, no, please call me Bella.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.320
Of course. Bella.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.840
This is... difficult for me to say.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.440
You must speak openly.
We're friends.

44:06.640 --> 44:10.400
Today I have managed to relieve
your difficulty...

44:10.400 --> 44:11.800
with Vincenzo Danioni.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.280
Thank you.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.600
But tomorrow it may return.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.000
Why do you say so?

44:18.000 --> 44:21.120
Oh, well. One day soon,
the summer will be over.

44:21.120 --> 44:24.280
And I will return to Rome.
Yes, but you'll come back.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.360
Next year? Perhaps.

44:29.880 --> 44:33.960
And your husband...
will be here to protect you.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.320
Yes, of course.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.640
And yet, for some reason...

44:38.640 --> 44:41.400
you asked for my assistance.
Not his.

44:41.400 --> 44:42.640
Oh. Well...

44:42.640 --> 44:46.440
Let me tell you,
I know a thousand men like Danioni.

44:46.440 --> 44:51.040
They believe they're owed something
and they are determined to take it.

44:51.040 --> 44:54.040
But... you have kept him at bay.

44:54.040 --> 44:58.320
No.
I have pretended to befriend him.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.360
Flattered him.

45:00.360 --> 45:02.040
Threatened him a little.

45:02.040 --> 45:04.800
But he will be back.

45:04.800 --> 45:08.560
Unless you break whatever hold
he has over you.

45:08.560 --> 45:09.880
I do not ask you to tell me.

45:11.240 --> 45:14.320
In truth,
I would prefer not to know.

45:14.320 --> 45:19.600
But as your friend, I advise you,
whatever is your fear,

45:19.600 --> 45:22.600
it cannot be worse
than letting Danioni bite you.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.520
Again and again.

45:26.520 --> 45:28.200
Like a rabid dog.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.160
There is also this.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.960
Where did you get this?

45:58.000 --> 46:01.640
Well, I think a man should always
be across his wife's affairs,

46:01.640 --> 46:03.320
Signor Ainsworth.

46:08.400 --> 46:10.280
Where is your anger, Signore?

46:11.920 --> 46:15.120
My anger?
Yeah.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.720
I mean, if I had lost a thing
of such value,

46:17.720 --> 46:20.480
such a beauty like this
to another man,

46:20.480 --> 46:21.840
I would be mad as hell.

46:23.560 --> 46:26.920
Just because I'm not shouting,
waving my arms around

46:26.920 --> 46:30.600
like you Italians are so bloody fond
of, it doesn't mean I'm not angry.

46:33.520 --> 46:35.880
So it lies beneath.

46:38.320 --> 46:41.080
My father taught me
to manage my anger.

46:41.080 --> 46:44.080
Because other people are so bad
at managing their stupidity.

46:45.320 --> 46:48.000
But it's ready to explode, no?
Like Vesuvio.

46:49.240 --> 46:51.720
Well, you know what they say
about revenge, Danioni.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.360
Tell me.

46:57.360 --> 47:00.960
Who will you take your revenge on?
Hmm? Signor Turner?

47:02.080 --> 47:04.520
Your English tennis champion?

47:04.520 --> 47:07.440
No, no, no, no!
The poor William Scanlon.

47:07.440 --> 47:09.640
Yeah, I think he's a good one.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.360
Has the boy said anything?

47:13.360 --> 47:17.920
Mm-mm.
No, he's true to omerta.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.320
He will not talk.

47:19.320 --> 47:22.400
But... the police
are still following up,

47:22.400 --> 47:24.320
with these associates you mentioned?

47:24.320 --> 47:27.320
Yeah. Also with Mr Wingfield.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.240
Just to check he's not hiding
anything in Milan

47:29.240 --> 47:31.760
with his balls and rackets.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.640
What about Turner?

47:33.640 --> 47:36.440
His name has been given to the
Guardia di Finanza, so it's fine.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.280
But, er...

47:38.280 --> 47:40.320
they can track his dealings?

47:42.000 --> 47:45.240
Listen, if Signor Turner
tries to sell the painting,

47:45.240 --> 47:47.240
they will know about it.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.600
Hello.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.480
Can we help you?

48:16.480 --> 48:19.120
Sorry to interrupt. I didn't know
when I'd get a better chance

48:19.120 --> 48:21.800
to return these to Mr Sengupta.
Oh!

48:24.200 --> 48:25.840
But... where did you find them?

48:25.840 --> 48:28.080
Under Lady Latchmere's bed.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.720
How did you know to look there?

48:29.720 --> 48:32.000
Billy told me
where he planned to hide them, sir,

48:32.000 --> 48:35.560
and I knew it was a bad idea,
so I moved them.  Where to?

48:37.320 --> 48:39.360
Somewhere no man
would ever think to look for them.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.880
THEY LAUGH

48:49.880 --> 48:52.960
Well, we were losing our minds
over them all afternoon.

48:52.960 --> 48:54.600
I'm sorry I didn't speak up earlier,

48:54.600 --> 48:56.360
it's just that I didn't want
to get Billy

48:56.360 --> 48:58.240
into any more trouble
than he is already.

48:58.240 --> 49:00.240
No, you have nothing
to apologise for.

49:00.240 --> 49:04.040
You are my guardian angel!
I could kiss you.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.520
Oh!
Oh!

49:05.520 --> 49:08.240
Oh?
Thank you.

49:11.920 --> 49:14.680
THEY LAUGH
Oh!

49:25.160 --> 49:29.360
Sergeant Ottonello, he believes
the painting will return to you.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.560
I pray he's right.

49:31.560 --> 49:33.760
I don't have the heart to tell him
that he's...

49:33.760 --> 49:35.880
chasing wild geese,
as the Americans would say?

49:37.400 --> 49:40.840
Now listen here, Danioni.
What the hell do you mean by that?

49:40.840 --> 49:44.440
Oh! He wastes his time, no?

49:44.440 --> 49:46.560
I don't need a lesson in English,
you fool.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.280
I want to know
what you're driving at.

49:48.280 --> 49:51.240
Be calm, Signor Ainsworth.
We both know the truth.

49:51.240 --> 49:52.600
I'm damned if I do.

49:52.600 --> 49:54.960
You wish me to say it?
Spit it out, man!

49:54.960 --> 49:57.520
You know exactly
what has happened to your painting.

50:00.520 --> 50:02.320
Why, you filthy dog!

50:04.320 --> 50:06.960
How dare you come in here
and abuse my hospitality

50:06.960 --> 50:09.320
with your greasy little
insinuations!

50:09.320 --> 50:11.200
If you seem to know so much
about it,

50:11.200 --> 50:13.040
perhaps it's because
you're in on it.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.200
I'd report you to the police,

50:15.200 --> 50:17.520
but it wouldn't surprise me
to learn they're in on it too.

50:18.760 --> 50:20.720
Bloody Italy.

50:20.720 --> 50:23.680
I shall report you
to the British consulate in Genoa.

50:29.400 --> 50:31.440
I may be a dog, Signor Ainsworth.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.240
But in Italy we have a saying.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.800
Cane non mangia cane.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.920
Dogs don't eat other dogs.

50:59.640 --> 51:00.920
Paola.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.280
Hey, Paola. Paola, please.

51:04.280 --> 51:07.760
Paola, please!
What's... what's wrong?

51:09.040 --> 51:10.880
Here... you come no more.

51:13.080 --> 51:15.280
No... Paola, I need you.
I need you, I do.

51:15.280 --> 51:18.040
I really need you!
Perche?

51:18.040 --> 51:20.240
Perche mi devi rendere le cose
cosi difficili?

51:20.240 --> 51:23.240
Perche mi rendi le cose
cosi difficili?

51:23.240 --> 51:25.800
I don't... I don't understand.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.720
Paola, why?

51:30.360 --> 51:32.280
You're not for me.

51:40.400 --> 51:41.960
Go.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.040
Now, go!

51:45.040 --> 51:47.120
Go!

52:43.640 --> 52:44.680
Cecil.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.560
I have something to tell you.

52:48.560 --> 52:50.040
Save your breath.

52:51.680 --> 52:53.800
Oh, gosh.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.360
I know everything.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.240
Oh, no. Darling...

52:59.960 --> 53:02.200
Please.
