00:00.149 --> 00:02.145
Previously on <i>Californication...</i>

00:02.265 --> 00:04.779
It's yo agent, calling from the coast,

00:04.813 --> 00:07.181
with the prospect of
a significant payday.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.313
I'll take it.

00:09.347 --> 00:10.981
Oh, shit.

00:11.015 --> 00:12.348
Man, what are the odds?

00:12.383 --> 00:13.920
I end up next to
the most beautiful woman

00:13.954 --> 00:16.592
in the Tri-state area, and I go
and spill a drink in her lap.

00:18.364 --> 00:21.534
Guess we shouldn't ruin it by
keeping in touch or anything.

00:21.569 --> 00:24.071
Alas, this one's
not your lady anymore, Hank.

00:24.106 --> 00:25.605
- He's like you...
- Bates.

00:25.640 --> 00:26.974
But awesome.

00:27.009 --> 00:28.775
- How's Becca?
- Boyfriend.

00:28.810 --> 00:30.345
Now, I want to kill him, Hank.

00:30.379 --> 00:31.414
We're keeping it simple.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.115
I come in peace, okay?

00:33.149 --> 00:35.153
The kid's a loathsome fuckin' asshole.

00:35.187 --> 00:39.090
Great seeing you, dad.
Always a pleasure.

00:39.124 --> 00:42.225
- He wants Hank to come to him.
- Who the fuck is "he"?

00:42.259 --> 00:43.960
Samurai Apocalypse.

00:43.994 --> 00:45.494
I need your words.

00:45.529 --> 00:47.262
What the fuck else you gonna do,
write another book?

00:47.297 --> 00:50.031
Fuck that, let's get paid,
motherfucker.

00:50.065 --> 00:53.901
Moody, this is Kali.
Remember this name, Kali, yo.

01:11.090 --> 01:12.358
Oh, my word.

01:12.392 --> 01:15.795
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

01:15.830 --> 01:17.431
Why?

01:17.465 --> 01:20.067
Was I doing something wrong?

01:20.101 --> 01:22.436
Oh, no, no, no.
That was world class.

01:22.470 --> 01:24.204
Some girls are timid

01:24.239 --> 01:26.473
and lack focus, but you,

01:26.507 --> 01:28.208
you should be in porn.

01:28.242 --> 01:29.675
Hmm?

01:29.710 --> 01:31.944
But only if you want to be.

01:31.978 --> 01:35.481
You are not taking this in the
spirit in which it was intended.

01:35.516 --> 01:38.050
Mm-mmm.

01:38.085 --> 01:39.085
Mmm.

01:41.755 --> 01:43.489
Allow me to explain.

01:43.523 --> 01:45.191
No, allow me, motherfucker!

01:46.860 --> 01:47.960
Die!

01:47.994 --> 01:49.728
Die, motherfucker!

01:49.763 --> 01:51.297
Yaaaah!

01:55.937 --> 01:57.471
Whoo!

01:57.505 --> 02:00.474
Charlie, thank God.

02:02.144 --> 02:04.178
You weren't just blowin' me
right now, were you?

02:04.213 --> 02:06.915
No, sirree, I most certainly was not.

02:06.949 --> 02:09.651
- Not even a little bit?
- No. No.

02:09.687 --> 02:12.022
Your Magic Johnson was
nowhere near my oral cavity.

02:12.056 --> 02:14.124
I did just beat off
in the shower, though.

02:14.158 --> 02:17.228
Yeah. I even got a little cum
on my foot, right here.

02:17.262 --> 02:20.399
Don't worry, washed right off.

02:20.433 --> 02:23.402
You are a fuckin' animal,
you know that?

02:25.773 --> 02:27.006
Goddamn L.A.

02:27.041 --> 02:29.876
I only have dreams like this
when I'm here.

02:29.910 --> 02:33.914
Hey, now.
You relax.

02:33.948 --> 02:36.016
Have yourself a cup of black gold.

02:36.050 --> 02:37.217
Hey, you know what we'll do?

02:37.251 --> 02:40.687
We will--we will
take a walk along the beach,

02:40.721 --> 02:44.424
we'll gaze upon
some foxy Malibu hard bodies.

02:44.458 --> 02:45.858
Fuck that shit.

02:45.893 --> 02:49.328
Can you get me on a plane back
to New York tonight, please?

02:49.363 --> 02:50.563
What about Samurai Apocalypse?

02:50.597 --> 02:51.564
What about him?

02:51.598 --> 02:54.133
He wants you, and only you.

02:54.168 --> 02:56.870
He loves your black ass.

02:56.904 --> 02:59.640
Well, it's always nice
to have one's black ass wanted,

02:59.674 --> 03:02.543
but I'm not sure if
the feelings are reciprocated.

03:02.577 --> 03:05.546
Well, then you'll have to tell him.

03:05.581 --> 03:07.916
That's your job, agent.

03:07.950 --> 03:10.519
He is a very important client, Hank.

03:10.553 --> 03:13.088
- This needs to be finessed.
- And if it isn't?

03:13.122 --> 03:15.691
Then I will be very upset with you.

03:17.060 --> 03:20.963
And what would that entail, exactly?

03:20.997 --> 03:22.998
I'm not sure exactly.

03:23.033 --> 03:24.133
But it will probably involve

03:24.167 --> 03:26.001
not returning your calls
in a timely manner.

03:26.036 --> 03:28.904
Oh, no.

03:28.939 --> 03:33.008
Aw, fuck.

03:33.043 --> 03:34.076
Yo-la.

03:34.110 --> 03:36.112
Becca is really upset with you.

03:36.146 --> 03:38.915
Yeah, that's sort of
a trending topic right now.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.751
I just think you should
try and make it up to her

03:40.785 --> 03:42.119
before you leave town.

03:42.153 --> 03:44.554
White woman, please.
She'll thank me later.

03:44.589 --> 03:46.389
Maybe, but you know, in the meantime,

03:46.424 --> 03:48.124
you could kiss and make nice.

03:48.159 --> 03:49.125
She's your only daughter.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.460
Oh, thank God.

03:50.494 --> 03:51.528
What?

03:51.562 --> 03:52.662
What are you doin' over there?

03:52.697 --> 03:53.697
Are you and Bates
playin' grab-ass?

03:53.731 --> 03:55.065
- Stop.
- Woman--

03:55.099 --> 03:56.166
- Stop.
- Be a professional,

03:56.201 --> 03:57.735
for Christ's sake.

03:57.769 --> 04:02.173
Does--d-d-does Becca need
an iPad or something like that?

04:02.207 --> 04:03.174
- What?
- Bye, Hank.

04:03.209 --> 04:04.943
Ka--

04:04.978 --> 04:06.211
Charlie, can you get me an iPad?

04:06.246 --> 04:08.981
Most certainly, if you
sit down with the Samurai.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.517
You're a real twatty
fuckin' cunt, you know that?

04:11.552 --> 04:13.286
Twat? Twat?
I cunt hear you.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.654
I've got
an ear in-fuck-tion.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.955
I'll finger it out later.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.457
You still got some cum on your foot.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.091
Made you look.

04:27.025 --> 04:37.225

05:23.727 --> 05:25.628
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Becca Moody.

05:25.662 --> 05:28.231
Ta-da!

05:30.301 --> 05:31.267
Ta-da.

05:31.301 --> 05:33.469
Oh, you have one already?

05:33.504 --> 05:35.371
I'm not 12.
You can't bribe me anymore.

05:35.405 --> 05:36.672
Well, you can,

05:36.707 --> 05:39.942
but you have to adjust
for lifestyle and inflation.

05:39.977 --> 05:42.345
I am not tryin' to bribe you, sweetie.

05:42.379 --> 05:44.547
I'm just tryin'
to weaken your steely resolve

05:44.582 --> 05:45.782
to hate the old man.

05:45.816 --> 05:48.017
I don't hate you.

05:48.052 --> 05:50.253
I'm just disappointed
that you don't trust me,

05:50.287 --> 05:53.690
and that you can't put aside all
your petty judgmental bullshit

05:53.724 --> 05:55.458
for the duration of one simple dinner.

05:55.492 --> 05:57.860
That's fair.

05:57.894 --> 05:59.529
But he was kind of a tool.

05:59.563 --> 06:01.131
This is how you say you're sorry?

06:01.165 --> 06:02.666
You're right.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.701
Let's--let's switch gears.

06:04.735 --> 06:07.170
What?

06:07.204 --> 06:08.804
Mmm.

06:10.474 --> 06:11.908
What,
you don't want to man-pound?

06:11.942 --> 06:14.577
Not really. Especially
when you put it that way.

06:14.612 --> 06:16.279
Okay, fine, be that way, dude.

06:16.313 --> 06:18.414
- What are you doin' here?
- I go here.

06:18.449 --> 06:19.983
Aren't you a little old for college?

06:20.017 --> 06:22.185
What are you, on the
six-year plan, Stephen Hawking?

06:22.219 --> 06:24.287
It's called grad school.
I'm a T.A.

06:24.321 --> 06:25.455
- It's how we met.
- Mm-hmm.

06:25.489 --> 06:26.722
Hey, that's against the rules.

06:26.757 --> 06:29.158
Dad, during your tenure
as a college professor,

06:29.193 --> 06:30.360
you slept with your T.A.,

06:30.394 --> 06:33.396
the Dean's wife,
and one of your students.

06:33.430 --> 06:34.731
She was a stripper, too.

06:34.765 --> 06:37.934
Way to go, Hank.
Up high.

06:37.969 --> 06:39.036
If you must know,

06:39.070 --> 06:40.704
that was a particularly
tough time for me.

06:40.738 --> 06:42.005
- I was not well.
- Mm-hmm.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.142
And I have
learned from my mistakes.

06:45.177 --> 06:47.011
This is not going as I had hoped.

06:47.045 --> 06:50.148
iPad 2?
Very nice.

06:50.182 --> 06:51.182
He tried to bribe me with it.

06:51.216 --> 06:53.684
- You already have one.
- That she does.

06:53.718 --> 06:55.952
Well, I don't already have one.

07:04.161 --> 07:06.028
Wow.

07:06.062 --> 07:07.229
Thanks, Hank.

07:07.263 --> 07:08.396
You're really startin' to grow on me.

07:08.430 --> 07:09.430
Pink, though?

07:09.465 --> 07:11.466
Is that--
Whatever, I'll take it.

07:12.802 --> 07:14.869
Mmm.

07:14.904 --> 07:18.740
Put my daughter
back on the ground, please.

07:27.784 --> 07:29.618
Fredo, how's it hanging?

07:29.652 --> 07:33.555
Oh, quite low, sir.

07:33.590 --> 07:35.357
Is the master expecting you?

07:35.392 --> 07:37.091
No, this is more of a cold call.

07:37.126 --> 07:39.928
- Oh, do please come in, sir.
- Thank you.

07:50.073 --> 07:51.640
Hey.

07:51.674 --> 07:53.174
What the fuck are you doing here?

07:53.209 --> 07:55.443
I might ask you
the very same question.

07:55.478 --> 07:57.246
It's complicated.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.747
I'm guessing
he doesn't know we're married.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.883
You're funny.

08:00.917 --> 08:02.317
And we just made out...
on a plane.

08:02.352 --> 08:06.087
We were up in the air.
What's the big deal?

08:06.122 --> 08:08.456
You know, he has guns,

08:08.491 --> 08:11.692
and samurai swords.

08:11.727 --> 08:14.095
I had a dream about you last night.

08:14.129 --> 08:15.329
Really?

08:15.364 --> 08:17.598
Mm-hmm.
You know what's funny?

08:17.633 --> 08:20.767
That little high school
make out session of ours,

08:20.802 --> 08:23.103
I can't stop thinkin' about it.

08:23.138 --> 08:24.138
You?

08:24.172 --> 08:26.240
Never.

08:26.274 --> 08:28.041
- Ever.
- Hmm.

08:28.075 --> 08:32.345
You have extremely moist lips.
They're like kissable cupcakes.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.081
It's as if sprinkles and crumbs
got together...

08:34.115 --> 08:35.849
And made sweet love

08:35.883 --> 08:41.756
and had these delicious little
smoochable cupcake babies.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.191
Hank Moody!

08:43.225 --> 08:45.093
'Sup, nigga?

08:45.128 --> 08:46.862
Better not be hittin' on my girl.

08:46.896 --> 08:49.699
- I'm not your girl, Calvin.
- Ooh, Calvin?

08:49.733 --> 08:52.201
Just playin', baby.
What you doin' here, man?

08:52.236 --> 08:54.070
You should be in Starbucks
writin' me some funny shit,

08:54.104 --> 08:55.805
some funny, quotable shit, too, nigga.

08:55.839 --> 08:59.208
Yeah, uh, that's the thing.
I don't think I can do it.

08:59.242 --> 09:00.409
What the fuck are you
talkin' about, man?

09:00.443 --> 09:01.843
What, they ain't payin' you enough?

09:01.877 --> 09:03.678
No, no, it-it's not the money.
I just don't want to.

09:03.712 --> 09:04.979
Why, because I'm black?

09:05.014 --> 09:06.047
No, it's not 'cause you're black.

09:06.082 --> 09:07.315
I love the fact that you're black.

09:07.349 --> 09:08.716
What, it's because
I got a white butler?

09:08.751 --> 09:10.685
No, I love the fact
that you got a white butler.

09:10.719 --> 09:11.886
Alfred is awesome.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.320
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- Respect.

09:13.355 --> 09:15.056
Oh, this is because
you hate hip-hop, right?

09:15.090 --> 09:16.523
No! Well, yeah,
I do hate hip-hop,

09:16.558 --> 09:17.892
but that's not why.

09:17.926 --> 09:19.193
Oh, you're just mad
'cause I be dealin'

09:19.227 --> 09:20.494
with that crazy-ass pussy,
huh?

09:20.529 --> 09:23.197
No, I fucked
all sorts of crazy pussy, too.

09:23.231 --> 09:24.831
Nigga, you don't be fuckin'
the kinda crazy pussy

09:24.866 --> 09:26.600
I be fuckin'.
Tell him, Alfred.

09:26.634 --> 09:29.202
Nigger, you don't be fuckin'
the same kind of crazy pussy

09:29.236 --> 09:30.403
as he be fuckin', sir.

09:30.438 --> 09:33.040
You'd be surprised, both of you.

09:33.074 --> 09:35.075
Yeah, right, like this
fine-ass bitch right here.

09:35.110 --> 09:36.710
Will you stop callin' me
a fuckin' bitch, please?

09:36.745 --> 09:38.445
Come on, mama, just peacockin', baby.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.181
She is a beautiful woman.
True dat.

09:41.216 --> 09:43.150
What's with the use
of all this urban patois, man?

09:43.185 --> 09:45.219
Hey, it's the A-B-Cs of me,
baby.

09:46.722 --> 09:49.791
Aw, fuck.
Yo, I gotta be somewhere, man.

09:49.826 --> 09:50.926
Come with me, yo.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.160
Gimme one day and I'm gonna show you

09:52.195 --> 09:54.429
why you want to be
in the Apocalypse business, man.

09:56.198 --> 09:57.265
He did what?

09:57.299 --> 09:59.067
Are you gonna make her repeat it?

09:59.101 --> 10:00.768
I need to understand.

10:00.803 --> 10:02.537
You're saying he took it out.

10:02.571 --> 10:04.005
He took his penis out,

10:04.039 --> 10:06.674
and he was masturbating
in front of Ava.

10:06.709 --> 10:07.876
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:07.910 --> 10:10.612
- Masturbating?
- Poor little Ava.

10:10.646 --> 10:13.481
She's so cute, but she's
a little tweaked, though, right?

10:13.515 --> 10:14.915
- You gotta admit.
- You can't even call it

10:14.950 --> 10:16.684
masturbation, I mean,
he's-- he's barely three.

10:16.718 --> 10:17.818
Can you cover that--
cover it up.

10:17.853 --> 10:19.420
Well, his penis was fully erect,

10:19.454 --> 10:21.255
and he was manipulating it.

10:21.289 --> 10:23.123
Sounds like he was experimenting.

10:23.157 --> 10:25.592
Or maybe he just intended to be funny.

10:25.627 --> 10:27.460
You know, bring
a little sunshine into her day.

10:27.495 --> 10:30.363
I blame you, Charlie.
Like father, like son.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.798
Oh, yeah, right,
the day you--

10:31.832 --> 10:33.800
Charlie, Marcy, this is not
the time or the place

10:33.834 --> 10:35.168
for the blame game.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.904
How can we repair this?

10:37.938 --> 10:39.272
Ava's mother was horrified.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.607
- Sure.
- Oh, it's terrible.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.676
And, she's threatening
to pull her out of school.

10:42.711 --> 10:43.844
That would be bad.

10:43.878 --> 10:45.345
We'd rather that not happen, so...

10:45.380 --> 10:47.414
Perhaps an apology.

10:47.449 --> 10:50.251
How about a sizable donation?

10:50.285 --> 10:51.987
Well, that would be helpful as well.

10:52.021 --> 10:53.422
- Done.
- I'm sure.

10:53.456 --> 10:54.423
- Thank you.
- Very helpful.

10:54.457 --> 10:56.826
Now if you'll excuse me.

10:59.630 --> 11:02.532
Great. You write the check.
I'll press the flesh.

11:02.567 --> 11:03.634
Come on, we have the nanny interviews.

11:03.668 --> 11:04.668
I know, I know.

11:04.703 --> 11:06.604
What happened to Irma?
"I put perfect."

11:06.638 --> 11:08.205
Marcy gave her the axe.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.607
What?

11:09.641 --> 11:11.642
Involve the father, maybe?

11:11.676 --> 11:14.011
Are you gonna be paying their salary?

11:14.045 --> 11:15.846
No, but she's gonna spend
a lot of time around my son,

11:15.880 --> 11:17.648
and I should be given
meaningful consultation.

11:17.682 --> 11:19.016
Fine. Fine.
We'll narrow it down.

11:19.050 --> 11:20.250
We'll bring you in
for call-backs, okay?

11:20.285 --> 11:23.053
- Stuart!

Man, you don't know shit
about hip-hop, do you?

11:42.507 --> 11:44.875
No, I'm more of
a classic rock guy, you know,

11:45.977 --> 11:47.511

11:47.545 --> 11:49.580

11:51.650 --> 11:54.451

11:54.486 --> 11:57.787
We hate each other's music,
which makes us different,

11:57.821 --> 11:59.155
but kinda the same.

11:59.189 --> 12:00.823
- Uh, huh.
- Feel me?

12:00.857 --> 12:03.025
- Yeah, I feel you.
- Want a man pound?

12:03.059 --> 12:04.693
- No.

12:29.721 --> 12:31.522
Oh, shit, I ain't never been there.

12:31.556 --> 12:34.257

Good to meet you.

13:04.754 --> 13:07.189
Uh, actually I think we know
some of the same people.

13:07.223 --> 13:09.225
In fact, I actually think we've been

13:09.259 --> 13:11.894
inside some of the same people,
if you know what I'm saying.

13:11.928 --> 13:13.462
Yeah, I think I do know
what you're saying,

13:13.497 --> 13:14.863
and I think it's creepin' me out.

13:14.898 --> 13:17.265
Yeah, well, uh,
we got a meetin', so, see ya.

13:17.299 --> 13:18.800
All right, cool.
I'll be at the bar.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.501
No, no.

13:20.536 --> 13:22.603
Nah, he's with me, yo.
He's gonna be writin' my shit.

13:22.638 --> 13:23.671
Oh, come on.

13:23.706 --> 13:26.007
No way, man.
I mean, no disrespect.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.977
Sam, I just did a serious
rewrite on the script, I mean--

13:29.011 --> 13:30.211
Yeah, but the shit
ain't crackin', man.

13:30.245 --> 13:31.446
I need my shit to crackle, man.

13:31.480 --> 13:32.446
What's the catchphrase?

13:32.481 --> 13:34.314
Catchphrase?
Uh...

13:34.349 --> 13:35.983
Killin' bad guys is my business,

13:36.017 --> 13:38.753
and business is fuckin' crackin'.

13:38.787 --> 13:40.788
- Killin' bad guys...
- Bad guys is my...business...

13:40.823 --> 13:42.090
- And business is...
- Fuckin' crackin'.

13:42.124 --> 13:43.124
- Business is--
- Nah.

13:43.158 --> 13:44.191
I don't know about that, man.

13:44.226 --> 13:45.793
- You know what?
- ...Crackin'.

13:45.828 --> 13:48.963
I'm gonna go drop some heat.
Y'all chop it up, a'ight?

13:48.997 --> 13:51.265
What the fuck are you doin'?
What is this?

13:51.299 --> 13:52.567
What are you talkin' about?

13:52.601 --> 13:54.502
Why are you suddenly in my shit?

13:54.536 --> 13:56.438
I don't want to be.
I'm tryin' to pass.

13:56.472 --> 13:57.805
This guy won't take no for an answer.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.908
You are a middle-aged
white guy.

14:00.943 --> 14:02.777
What the fuck do you know
about black culture?

14:02.811 --> 14:06.013
Absolutely nothin', but you're
makin' <i>Santa Monica Cop?</i>

14:06.048 --> 14:07.348
What the fuck does that
have to do with black culture?

14:07.382 --> 14:09.383
The character was originally
from Compton, get it?

14:09.417 --> 14:10.651
- Whatever, dude.
- You ever been to Compton?

14:10.685 --> 14:12.252
Go make your movie.
I'm no threat to you.

14:12.286 --> 14:13.287
Oh really?
You're no threat to me?

14:13.321 --> 14:14.288
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

14:14.322 --> 14:16.123
- Sure?
- Go.

14:16.157 --> 14:17.357
What about Michelle?

14:17.391 --> 14:19.126
Michelle?

14:19.160 --> 14:21.494
Girl you fucked while I was
still goin' out with her.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.396
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, uh-huh.

14:23.431 --> 14:25.865
I--I'm sorry, I had--
I had no idea.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.200
Yeah, well, she found out

14:27.234 --> 14:29.168
I was fuckin' around on her
a little bit.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.603
- We had a little fight.
- Mm-hmm.

14:30.638 --> 14:32.038
She went to a bar in Venice.

14:32.073 --> 14:33.607
She met you, she fucked you,

14:33.641 --> 14:36.409
she told me about it
in a fucking email.

14:36.444 --> 14:37.877
A very descriptive fucking email,

14:37.912 --> 14:39.379
which actually I still have.

14:39.413 --> 14:40.780
Would you like me to read it to you?

14:40.814 --> 14:42.515
No!
I think that's a terrible idea.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.384
- You sure?
- Well, you know, actually,

14:44.418 --> 14:46.553
it might be kind of an
interesting time capsule for me.

14:46.587 --> 14:48.888
You know, like a stroll down
memory--no, actually, no.

14:48.923 --> 14:50.123
Don't, I'm good.
All right?

14:50.157 --> 14:52.525
- And--and again, I'm sorry.
- I loved her.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.427
I actually think she was the one.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.395
Then why were you cheatin' on her?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.530
It was gonna be the last time,
that's why.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.131
It was my kinda final dalliance.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.499
I was ready to hang it up.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.501
I mean, that's how much
this girl meant to me.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.537
She actually made me reconsider
all the fucked up shit I'd done

15:06.571 --> 15:09.407
behind her back.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.509
I'm sorry for your loss, Peter.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.611
Shit happens.

15:13.645 --> 15:15.847
Yeah, well, shit happens.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.081
Shit does, in fact, happen.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.550
Well, hey,
maybe that's your catchphrase.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.751
But it's a--
it's a black movie,

15:19.785 --> 15:21.353
so maybe it's
"Shit be happenin'."

15:21.387 --> 15:24.022
- Okay, let's go.
- Where?

15:24.057 --> 15:26.158
Outside. You and I
are gonna settle this like men.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.060
- Let's go.
- Why?

15:28.095 --> 15:31.263
For years, I've been tormented
by the image of my girl,

15:31.298 --> 15:33.265
the one that got away,
getting banged out

15:33.300 --> 15:36.869
by some smug fuckin' writer.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.938
Time to make this right.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.973
Let's go.
Let's go!

15:41.007 --> 15:43.375
Really? You made a movie
about a battleship?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.077
- Come on.
- Man, just,

15:45.111 --> 15:46.712
- thanks for <i>Aspen Extreme.</i>
- Put your shit out there.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.313
What the fuck y'all crackers
up to out here, man?

15:48.347 --> 15:49.881
- What up, Pete?
- Nah, he fucked

15:49.916 --> 15:52.050
one of my ex-girls,
when I was still with her.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.919
- Oh, come on.
- Moody, you a fuckin' dog.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.788
- Rapin' and pillagin'?
- I didn't know.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.090
Aw, man, I'll kill that
motherfucker that touch my girl.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.158
- Get him, Berg!
- Whose side are you--

15:59.193 --> 16:00.493
- Uh!
- Oh!

16:04.532 --> 16:05.766
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.067
- Ava's mom.
- Oh, no, I'm--

16:07.101 --> 16:08.202
I'm Charlie Runkle.

16:08.236 --> 16:10.538
Stuart's dad, we spoke on the phone.

16:10.572 --> 16:12.373
No, I'm just the nanny, but come in.

16:12.407 --> 16:13.941
Oh! Oh, oh.

16:32.961 --> 16:35.797

- And you call me Charlie.

16:35.831 --> 16:37.398
Uh, okay.

16:37.433 --> 16:41.003

16:41.037 --> 16:43.306

16:43.340 --> 16:45.074
Your son's disgusting behavior.

16:45.109 --> 16:47.844
Ava's cried herself to sleep
every night since the incident.

16:47.878 --> 16:50.714
How can we make this better?

16:50.748 --> 16:52.282
You're an agent, aren't you?

16:52.316 --> 16:54.517
That I am.
U.T.K.

16:54.552 --> 16:55.885

16:55.920 --> 16:57.387

16:57.421 --> 17:01.491
Oh. Uh, of course.
Tough negotiator.

17:01.525 --> 17:03.460
But fair.
Always fair.

17:03.494 --> 17:04.794
Bullshit!

17:04.829 --> 17:07.631
He's an abusive sociopath
and a casual alcoholic.

17:07.665 --> 17:12.469
- I'm not the biggest fan.
- Neither am I.

17:12.502 --> 17:16.173
Actually, uh,
he's kind of a bully, in fact.

17:16.207 --> 17:20.310
Yes, yes, he is, and I have
the scars to prove it.

17:20.345 --> 17:24.981
Okay.
Um, a peace offering.

17:25.016 --> 17:26.950
What do you say you and I

17:26.984 --> 17:29.719
discuss this further
over a glass of Sauvignon blanc?

17:29.754 --> 17:32.990
I shouldn't.
But I will.

17:35.794 --> 17:38.295
- Karma's a bitch, ain't it?
- It's not karma.

17:38.330 --> 17:41.432
It's just shitty fuckin' luck.

17:41.466 --> 17:43.467
That motherfucker's

17:43.502 --> 17:45.503

man!

18:44.797 --> 18:46.797
Hey, look who's cryin' now.

18:46.832 --> 18:48.999
Chase, take that motherfucker
to the hospital, man.

18:49.034 --> 18:50.467
No, man!

18:50.502 --> 18:53.003
Oh, shit.

18:53.037 --> 18:57.709
I ain't got no fuckin' medical!

18:57.744 --> 19:03.716
♪ When you really want to
burn that bridge? ♪

19:10.025 --> 19:12.860
What does your wife do?

19:12.894 --> 19:16.163
She has sex with a very rich
movie producer named Stu Beggs.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.333
- Mmm, of course. Marcy.
- Mm-hmm.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.435
I see her all the time
at the bar method.

19:23.805 --> 19:25.606
I had sex with Stu Beggs once.

19:25.641 --> 19:27.108
Yeah, I was his development girl

19:27.142 --> 19:29.544
for a short time
in the mid-90s.

19:29.578 --> 19:31.713
- Huge penis.
- Yes, I'm well aware.

19:31.747 --> 19:35.383
- Like a bratwurst.
- Okay. Enough.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.185
He asked me to pee on him.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.988
Really?

19:40.022 --> 19:40.989
Did you?

19:41.023 --> 19:42.691
Yes.

19:42.725 --> 19:44.827
I had to go.
Seemed silly to just say no.

19:44.861 --> 19:46.862
Makes sense.

19:46.897 --> 19:49.065
I don't want to
take Ava out of broken arrow.

19:49.099 --> 19:50.366
It's a great school,

19:50.400 --> 19:53.202
and it funnels into
all the best elementary schools.

19:53.237 --> 19:54.537
That is what they say.

19:54.571 --> 19:57.840
So...

19:57.875 --> 19:59.141
How do we fix this?

19:59.176 --> 20:01.210
What makes boys
want to take their dicks out

20:01.244 --> 20:03.212
and show them to girls?

20:03.246 --> 20:07.016
Uh, I don't know.
Pride of ownership, maybe?

20:07.050 --> 20:09.385
Are you gonna take yours out?

20:09.419 --> 20:11.353
I'm sorry?

20:11.387 --> 20:13.355
Don't you want to show me yours?

20:13.389 --> 20:15.991
My...

20:16.025 --> 20:16.992
penis?

20:17.026 --> 20:19.027
Your dick.
Your sausage.

20:19.062 --> 20:21.030
Your cock,
whatever you want to call it.

20:21.064 --> 20:23.732
Are you gonna take it out
and masturbate for me?

20:23.767 --> 20:27.237
Just like your son did
in front of my daughter.

20:31.309 --> 20:32.909
Why would I do that?

20:32.944 --> 20:34.411
Why not?

20:41.318 --> 20:43.885
That's right.

20:43.919 --> 20:46.454
Touch yourself.

20:46.489 --> 20:47.956
Oh.

20:47.990 --> 20:49.958
You filthy pig.

20:49.992 --> 20:51.859
You pervert.

20:51.894 --> 20:53.594
Why do you want to show me your dick?

20:53.629 --> 20:56.464
That pathetic
little excuse for a penis.

20:56.499 --> 20:57.798
It looks like your son's.

20:57.833 --> 21:00.068
Do you fuck grown women
with that thing?

21:00.102 --> 21:02.804
Are they ever satisfied?

21:02.838 --> 21:04.539
How could they be?

21:04.573 --> 21:06.807
What's it like...

21:06.842 --> 21:11.012
To have the desire, but not
the right tool for the job?

21:12.348 --> 21:15.318
Jesus Christ, Lizzie!

21:15.352 --> 21:17.220
How about some fucking privacy?

21:17.254 --> 21:18.721
I'm so sorry.

21:18.756 --> 21:20.657
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

21:20.691 --> 21:22.091
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

21:22.126 --> 21:24.061
Clean up in here, you pig.

21:50.452 --> 21:52.887
Hey, are--are you okay?

21:52.922 --> 21:54.890
I just got fired.

21:54.924 --> 21:57.860
Oh, no.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:57.894 --> 21:59.495
Don't be.
She was a nightmare to work for.

21:59.529 --> 22:02.532
Yeah, I got the feeling.

22:05.903 --> 22:07.771
She hits on everyone, you know.

22:07.806 --> 22:10.542
Messengers, mailmen, gardeners.

22:10.576 --> 22:13.311
I walked in on her
and the DirecTV guy once.

22:13.345 --> 22:15.279
She had her finger up his ass.

22:15.313 --> 22:16.447
Up his ass?

22:16.481 --> 22:19.083
Yeah, she's really fucked up.

22:19.117 --> 22:21.085
I should say so.

22:22.421 --> 22:25.289
Hey, are you lookin' for a new gig?

22:25.323 --> 22:27.824
Yeah, absolutely.
I really need the money...

22:27.859 --> 22:30.260
- For cooking school.
- Awesome.

22:30.294 --> 22:31.828
People love food.

22:31.863 --> 22:33.463
Yeah.

22:33.498 --> 22:35.065
Well, as luck would have it,

22:35.100 --> 22:38.602
my ex-wife is lookin' for
a new nanny for our son.

22:38.637 --> 22:42.173
And your son is the one
who exposed himself to Ava.

22:42.208 --> 22:45.277
Yes. Yes,
but he's really very sweet.

22:45.311 --> 22:49.414
My guess is, he meant it
as a compliment.

22:49.449 --> 22:50.716
What do you think?

22:50.750 --> 22:53.485
Any interest?

22:53.519 --> 22:55.487
Thank you.

23:08.999 --> 23:12.134
So look, man, you had a chance
to spend the whole day with me.

23:12.169 --> 23:14.537
Know what I mean?
See behind the curtain.

23:14.571 --> 23:17.106
So what's this gonna be?

23:17.141 --> 23:21.678
No disrespect, but I think
I'm gonna have to pass.

23:21.712 --> 23:22.880
I gotta--

23:26.885 --> 23:29.152
Will you excuse me for a second?

23:36.728 --> 23:37.796
Hey, Tyler.

23:39.565 --> 23:42.033
Hank.
What's up, man?

23:42.067 --> 23:44.001
Fancy seeing you again.

23:44.036 --> 23:46.037
This--this is--
this is not what it looks like.

23:46.071 --> 23:47.204
This is my sister.

23:47.239 --> 23:48.706
How's Becca?

23:48.740 --> 23:50.308
She's at home with her mom.

23:50.342 --> 23:51.475
She didn't want to come out tonight.

23:51.510 --> 23:52.676
You know, I really dig that about her.

23:52.711 --> 23:54.478
- She know where you are?
- Yeah, of course.

23:54.513 --> 23:56.146
I was just texting with her.

23:56.181 --> 23:57.414
Does she know about your sister?

23:57.449 --> 24:00.184
Okay, I--
I really like Becca, okay, I do,

24:00.219 --> 24:03.421
but life is short, man,
you know, and just sometimes,

24:03.455 --> 24:06.991
sometimes shit happens.

24:07.026 --> 24:09.894
Is she aware of how loose
this arrangement is?

24:09.929 --> 24:11.329
I don't know, Hank.

24:11.363 --> 24:15.366
We're just sorta takin' it day by day.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.335
Shit. You got that look
in your eye,

24:17.369 --> 24:18.469
like you want to hit me.

24:18.504 --> 24:20.237
Feel free...

24:20.272 --> 24:22.907
If you want your daughter
to hate you for life.

24:25.276 --> 24:28.311
Gotcha!

24:28.346 --> 24:30.480
Look, is there anything else
you want to discuss?

24:30.514 --> 24:32.082
No? Okay, cool.

24:32.116 --> 24:33.116
Have a good night.

24:35.086 --> 24:37.955
Hey, sis.

24:41.693 --> 24:44.396
What the fuck was that all about?

24:44.430 --> 24:48.834
Some guy my daughter's seeing
doesn't seem entirely faithful.

24:48.868 --> 24:50.335
I think he's gonna break her heart.

24:50.370 --> 24:52.538
Maybe we should break his legs first.

24:52.572 --> 24:53.973
That was my first impulse,

24:54.007 --> 24:56.709
but if I do that, then
she's gonna hate me forever.

24:56.743 --> 24:59.144
I have a history of doing
the well-intentioned wrong thing

24:59.178 --> 25:00.245
when it comes to her.

25:00.279 --> 25:03.281
So Moody's a good father, huh?

25:03.315 --> 25:05.283
I like that in a brother.

25:05.317 --> 25:07.351
Me too.

25:14.191 --> 25:16.459
You know what? I'm gonna--
I'm gonna take off.

25:16.493 --> 25:18.395
Peace.

25:18.429 --> 25:19.396
Peace out, nigga.

25:19.430 --> 25:22.165
Good luck on your project.

25:34.078 --> 25:35.412
Just so you know,

25:35.446 --> 25:38.382
you're well-represented
in this battle of the exes.

25:38.416 --> 25:39.850
I got your back, rapist.

25:39.884 --> 25:42.586
<i>Mucho appreciato,</i> Batesy.

25:42.620 --> 25:44.888
- Ladies.
- Oh, my God.

25:44.923 --> 25:46.523
You've been in town for two days,

25:46.558 --> 25:48.292
and you have a black eye already.

25:48.326 --> 25:49.593
Apparently, I had it comin'.

25:49.628 --> 25:52.329
Really?
Shocker.

25:52.363 --> 25:55.098
Becca, can I speak with you a moment?

25:55.133 --> 25:59.069
No.

25:59.104 --> 26:02.839
Go and speak with him.

26:05.677 --> 26:08.679
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, you know?

26:08.713 --> 26:10.347
It's not right of me to swoop in here

26:10.381 --> 26:11.782
and give you a hard time
about your life.

26:11.817 --> 26:14.052
But you have to know
it comes from a good place.

26:14.086 --> 26:15.520
You know, a place of
wanting to protect you

26:15.554 --> 26:16.821
from all the bad shit
that's out there.

26:16.855 --> 26:19.624
I know what guys are like.

26:19.658 --> 26:23.828
I've been that guy.

26:23.863 --> 26:25.430
I am that guy,

26:25.464 --> 26:27.966
sometimes.

26:28.001 --> 26:29.835
It's just so hard
to tell the difference

26:29.870 --> 26:32.505
between those that have a good heart

26:32.539 --> 26:34.574
and the ones that are
just out there to win.

26:34.608 --> 26:37.877
He's a good guy, dad.
I know it.

26:37.912 --> 26:42.516
I know it like I know
you're a good guy, deep down.

26:49.391 --> 26:51.258
Speak of the handsome devil.

26:52.294 --> 26:53.661
Hold on a sec, dad.

26:53.695 --> 26:58.399
Hello.

26:58.433 --> 27:02.637
You did good.
It'll be okay.

27:02.671 --> 27:06.207
You sure about that?

27:06.241 --> 27:07.442
Can someone take me to the hospital?

27:07.476 --> 27:09.243
Why?
What's happened?

27:09.278 --> 27:10.578
Tyler was leaving some club
in Hollywood,

27:10.612 --> 27:12.279
and he got jumped
by a bunch of gangbangers.

27:12.314 --> 27:14.648
They beat him up pretty bad.
He's at Cedars.

27:14.682 --> 27:16.684
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
Of course, come on.

27:16.718 --> 27:17.818
Let's go.

27:17.852 --> 27:20.120
- Um, have you got the keys?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:20.155 --> 27:22.545
Sounds like
the little turd-fondler

27:22.665 --> 27:24.717
finally pissed off the wrong guy.
