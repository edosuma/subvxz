WEBVTT

00:01.720 --> 00:06.050
- DI Denton.
- DS Jayne Akers, calling
with request for urgent assistance.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.810
Immediate and credible threat
to life.

00:07.860 --> 00:10.460
I need a safe and available
destination, ASAP.

00:11.780 --> 00:14.690
There's been an attack on the police.

00:14.740 --> 00:18.610
Three of our colleagues have lost
their lives in the line of duty.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.930
You called me that night.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.420
Yes, sir.

00:25.020 --> 00:27.650
I shouldn't have even
been on duty that night.

00:27.700 --> 00:30.210
I'd do anything not to have been
there, not to have picked up

00:30.260 --> 00:32.570
that call, because for all I know
it's going to take away

00:32.619 --> 00:35.570
the one good thing in my life, and
that is being a police officer.

00:35.620 --> 00:38.250
I'm heading up a newly-formed unit
that's taken over

00:38.300 --> 00:39.820
the search for Carly Kirk.

00:41.980 --> 00:43.090
Oh!

00:43.140 --> 00:45.930
- DS Arnott, AC-12?
- Boss.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.580
People have underestimated me
my whole life.

00:51.220 --> 00:53.530
I'll open up Witness Protection
to your team.

00:53.580 --> 00:57.090
There's a DI in AC-9.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.970
He's your man. You'll second him.

00:59.020 --> 01:00.210
As you wish, sir.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.380
Whatever it takes to nail
those bastards.

01:05.060 --> 01:08.130
Your call history makes for very
interesting reading.

01:08.180 --> 01:10.450
The night of the ambush
she called me to call you.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.810
To say what?

01:11.860 --> 01:14.660
For you to call her back about
the case she was working on.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.930
This is the home
under protective custody,

01:18.980 --> 01:21.730
of staff nurse Claire Tindall.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.530
You interviewed her in connection
with events at the hospital.

01:24.580 --> 01:26.060
There are more photos.

01:28.020 --> 01:31.170
The protected witness.
The wee gobshite this was all about.

01:31.220 --> 01:32.540
Christ!

01:35.420 --> 01:38.410
DI Denton, I'm arresting you for
conspiracy to murder

01:38.460 --> 01:39.700
a protected witness.

01:41.260 --> 01:44.370
What was in the witness protection
files?

01:44.420 --> 01:46.500
Oh, my God. Was it someone you knew?

01:48.740 --> 01:51.380
I'm innocent. You know I am.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.140 --> 02:38.580
All rise.

02:50.540 --> 02:51.580
Remain standing.

02:53.220 --> 02:55.850
Are you Lindsay Elizabeth Denton?

02:55.900 --> 02:57.050
(Yes.)

02:57.100 --> 02:59.650
Please speak up so we can hear you.

02:59.700 --> 03:00.890
Yes.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.220
Sit down, Ms Denton.

03:04.340 --> 03:05.900
Morning, Ms Latimer.

03:07.180 --> 03:11.210
Your Honour, the defendant is
charged with conspiracy to murder.

03:11.260 --> 03:14.730
This is a very serious charge
arising from a complex investigation

03:14.780 --> 03:16.700
by Anti-Corruption Unit 12.

03:18.260 --> 03:22.540
A 36-year-old woman has been charged
with conspiracy to murder.

03:24.340 --> 03:27.130
There are rumours the victim
was a protected witness

03:27.180 --> 03:29.090
granted immunity from prosecution.

03:29.140 --> 03:33.170
No further details will be
disclosed at present.

03:33.220 --> 03:37.090
The charging of the 36-year-old woman
is a highly significant breakthrough,

03:37.140 --> 03:40.130
and we're confident that more
arrests will follow.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.650
Nick Ronson, from the Evening Post.

03:45.700 --> 03:48.170
Thanks. Do you think the Witness
Protection Scheme

03:48.220 --> 03:49.500
is fit for purpose?

03:50.900 --> 03:52.820
No comment. Thank you all.

03:59.460 --> 04:00.970
Well handled, sir.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.180
Cheers, Les.

04:05.060 --> 04:06.130
Champion.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.450
You're the new Media Manager?
Jo Wright.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.180
New Jo. Have you got a minute?
Sure.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.290
There's a false speeding
story about me...

04:15.340 --> 04:17.050
With this arrest, sir, it's dead.

04:17.100 --> 04:20.170
Good. A stupid, pointless
distraction.

04:20.220 --> 04:23.410
Oh, and civilians don't have
to call me sir.

04:23.460 --> 04:26.130
I'd feel uncomfortable not
respecting your rank.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.810
OK. Great.

04:28.860 --> 04:31.890
Is there to be a bail application?
Yes, Your Honour.

04:31.940 --> 04:35.250
Your Honour, the prosecution opposes
bail on the following grounds.

04:35.300 --> 04:38.250
The seriousness of the offence,
the defendant has the means

04:38.300 --> 04:40.450
and knowledge to abscond from
justice.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.810
Your Honour, the defendant is
a serving police officer

04:42.860 --> 04:43.970
of excellent standing.

04:44.020 --> 04:47.580
She has no desire to abscond.
She intends to clear her name.

04:49.940 --> 04:51.290
I'm refusing bail.

04:51.340 --> 04:54.780
You will be remanded in custody
until the 18th of November.

04:55.820 --> 04:56.860
All rise.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.260
What about Bella?

05:13.500 --> 05:15.780
Has anyone got an evidence
bag for this?

05:32.580 --> 05:36.170
Answering only yes or no,
do you understand spoken English?

05:36.220 --> 05:37.810
Yes.

05:37.860 --> 05:42.090
Answering only yes or no,
are you Lindsay Elizabeth Denton?

05:42.140 --> 05:44.050
Yes. Answering only yes or no,

05:44.100 --> 05:46.570
are you currently suffering from an
infectious disease?

05:46.620 --> 05:47.850
No.

05:47.900 --> 05:48.970
Answering only yes or no,

05:49.020 --> 05:52.250
are you currently suffering from a
sexually transmitted disease?

05:52.300 --> 05:53.290
No.

05:53.340 --> 05:57.090
Answering only yes or no, are you
or could you be pregnant?

05:57.140 --> 05:58.250
No.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.450
You'll reside in
the Vulnerable Persons Unit.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.610
You will be in a cell on your own
and you will have

06:02.660 --> 06:04.970
minimal association with
the other residents.

06:05.020 --> 06:08.020
Answering only yes or no,
do you understand? Yes.

06:18.260 --> 06:20.730
When an Offender Management Officer
enters your cell,

06:20.780 --> 06:22.810
she'll order you to move
away from the door.

06:22.860 --> 06:25.090
Answering only yes or no,
do you understand?

06:25.140 --> 06:26.850
Yeah.

06:26.900 --> 06:30.210
If you maintain good behaviour,
you may request a television set,

06:30.260 --> 06:34.170
the cost at Â£2 per week to be
taken out of your allowance.

06:34.220 --> 06:36.420
Can I request
a piano keyboard, please?

06:37.500 --> 06:38.850
Answering only yes or no,

06:38.900 --> 06:42.100
would you like to request
a television set? No.

06:43.580 --> 06:44.980
Move away from the door.

07:10.340 --> 07:13.650
Oh, what's that tosser doing here?
Buggered if I know.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.330
Morning, you two.
Morning, sir.

07:17.380 --> 07:20.380
Sir, what's he doing here?
Oh, yeah...

07:24.780 --> 07:27.770
Look, our investigation has expanded
into Witness Protection.

07:27.820 --> 07:29.890
The Deputy Chief Constable ordered
me to bring on

07:29.940 --> 07:31.290
a specialist from AC-9.

07:31.340 --> 07:33.090
Those bastards have been
keeping us out.

07:33.140 --> 07:34.890
AC-9 did not make the call, Steve.

07:34.940 --> 07:37.290
Dot Cottan certainly did not
make the call.

07:37.340 --> 07:38.930
This has come directly from the
office

07:38.980 --> 07:40.290
of the Deputy Chief Constable.

07:40.340 --> 07:42.290
I'm not saying you should've run it
by us first.

07:42.340 --> 07:45.250
I'm glad you're not saying that,
Steve, because that shows you're not

07:45.300 --> 07:47.410
confused about who's in charge here.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.730
Come on, give him a chance.

07:49.780 --> 07:51.450
The Tony Gates team was disbanded,

07:51.500 --> 07:54.210
Cottan went on to distinguish
himself, got himself a promotion,

07:54.260 --> 07:56.850
and the fact of the matter is he was
the only officer in that unit

07:56.900 --> 08:00.370
who was prepared to stand up and
give evidence against his boss.

08:00.420 --> 08:03.340
He's a born Anti-Corruption Officer,
poacher turned gamekeeper.

08:06.940 --> 08:09.330
Move away from the door!

09:10.380 --> 09:13.970
The dirty bastards put shit in my
food. Don't you people check?

09:14.020 --> 09:17.020
Answering yes or no,
don't you people check?

09:18.340 --> 09:21.530
The target of the 5th September
ambush was a protected witness.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.050
To fill you in on the details,

09:23.100 --> 09:25.970
I'd like to introduce you to
Detective Inspector Matthew Cottan.

09:26.020 --> 09:27.940
Thank you, Matt.
Thanks a lot, sir.

09:29.980 --> 09:32.530
In June of 2012,

09:32.580 --> 09:35.730
a double murder at Greek Lane,
Moss Heath,

09:35.780 --> 09:38.250
that was originally thought to have
been drug-related,

09:38.300 --> 09:41.260
was recrimed as a terrorist
incident.

09:43.100 --> 09:48.610
This individual is
John Thomas Hunter.

09:48.660 --> 09:53.010
He used the name Tommy and had
proven links with organised crime.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.970
Tommy co-operated with the
investigation

09:55.020 --> 09:56.690
into the Greek Lane terror incident

09:56.740 --> 10:00.290
in return for immunity from
prosecution.

10:00.340 --> 10:03.220
Tommy was the target of the ambush.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.450
Having been enrolled in the
Witness Protection programme,

10:08.500 --> 10:11.170
he was given a new identity as
Alex Campbell

10:11.220 --> 10:15.220
and relocated to a safe house at
12 St James's Close.

10:16.820 --> 10:20.490
On the night of September 5th
his Witness Protection Officer,

10:20.540 --> 10:24.330
DS Jayne Akers, notified an
immediate threat against her witness

10:24.380 --> 10:29.130
and attempted to move him into safe
custody at 4th Street Station.

10:29.180 --> 10:31.610
As we all know, Akers was killed

10:31.660 --> 10:34.650
and the witness received
critical injuries.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.970
A second, successful attempt
on his life was made

10:37.020 --> 10:40.850
at the General Hospital
nine days later. Yes?

10:40.900 --> 10:43.980
No prosecutions resulted from
the Greek Lane counter-terror op.

10:45.420 --> 10:49.330
As a result, as I was going on
to say,

10:49.380 --> 10:51.650
the witness's immunity was
in jeopardy.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.810
The only way for him to stay out of
prison was to prove his value.

10:54.860 --> 10:57.930
So you think this got back to the
witness's criminal associates,

10:57.980 --> 11:00.010
which prompted their plan
to silence him?

11:00.060 --> 11:02.210
Exactly that, sir. Yeah.

11:02.260 --> 11:06.140
DS Akers was the person closest
to the witness, trusted by him.

11:07.780 --> 11:11.020
So if he was going to name names,
she'd be the one to know.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.460
What?

11:14.460 --> 11:16.290
DS Akers was killed in the ambush.

11:16.340 --> 11:18.410
How'd it fit that
she betrayed Tommy?

11:18.460 --> 11:20.130
Well, unknown to Akers,

11:20.180 --> 11:24.380
she may also have been the target of
the ambush, killed for her silence.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.220
Sounds like a guess.

11:28.260 --> 11:30.690
I'd call it a working hypothesis.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.730
We've charged DI Lindsay Denton.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.890
AC-9 wouldn't happen to be sitting
on a connection

11:34.940 --> 11:37.370
between Tommy and Denton?
Not that I know of.

11:37.420 --> 11:41.810
Yet. Which is why we are pooling
our resources. Thank you, Matthew.

11:41.860 --> 11:42.850
Thanks, sir.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.610
Assignments in respect of
the foregoing

11:45.660 --> 11:49.660
will come via me or DI Cottan.
Thank you. That is all.

11:52.620 --> 11:56.450
Also before you go. I've got some
hand-outs, should anybody want one.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.780
For Christ's sake.

12:37.260 --> 12:40.060
Kindly take a seat and your event
will commence shortly.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.970
Hello, Inspector, how are you?

13:09.020 --> 13:10.980
Hmm. Tickety-boo.

13:12.780 --> 13:15.330
I need to conduct a further interview
in regard to the ambush

13:15.380 --> 13:17.100
on the night of September 5th.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.890
You remain under caution.

13:19.940 --> 13:22.530
There are strict rules for
post-charge interview.

13:22.580 --> 13:25.330
One of which is for the detainee to
have put to them information

13:25.380 --> 13:28.130
which has come to light
since they were charged.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.820
In the interests of justice.

13:32.340 --> 13:33.570
Go on.

13:33.620 --> 13:38.290
Who was DS Akers' protected witness?
I don't know. I never knew.

13:38.340 --> 13:41.060
You never saw him,
never heard a name? No.

13:47.780 --> 13:49.900
Have you ever seen this man before?

13:51.140 --> 13:52.180
No.

13:54.140 --> 13:57.490
Fine. Have it your own way.

13:57.540 --> 14:00.980
Is that the new information?
Was that the witness?

14:07.780 --> 14:09.770
Fine. End of conversation.

14:09.820 --> 14:12.690
Why didn't you reveal to Hastings and
Arnott that I'd received a call

14:12.740 --> 14:15.250
off DS Akers' husband on the night of
the ambush?

14:15.300 --> 14:17.690
I didn't need to. No?

14:17.740 --> 14:19.810
No. Hastings makes Greece
look solvent

14:19.860 --> 14:21.610
and Arnott can't keep it
in his pants.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.580
Their transgressions are minor
in comparison. Irrelevant.

14:26.820 --> 14:29.050
How did you figure out I was
an undercover officer?

14:29.100 --> 14:30.970
What, I give you tips so you can do
a better job

14:31.020 --> 14:33.970
on the next innocent officer
that you go after?

14:34.020 --> 14:35.660
I did a good enough job on you.

14:37.420 --> 14:38.530
You want me on a string,

14:38.580 --> 14:40.690
wondering when you're going
to screw up my career.

14:40.740 --> 14:43.410
You don't like it when the shoe's
on the other foot, do you, Kate?

14:43.460 --> 14:45.330
Let me explain something to you,
Inspector.

14:45.380 --> 14:48.410
You're facing a charge of conspiracy
to murder. That's a life sentence.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.450
I'm not going to be in here
for life. I'm innocent

14:50.500 --> 14:51.690
and I'm going to clear my name

14:51.740 --> 14:54.930
and that will become apparent at
the trial. If we get that far.

14:54.980 --> 14:57.770
We will.
Is this what you want, Kate?

14:57.820 --> 15:00.570
Wouldn't it be better if you went
out and found the actual culprit,

15:00.620 --> 15:03.570
and got all the charges against me
dropped? The evidence points at you.

15:03.620 --> 15:04.850
Circumstantial evidence.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.810
The CPS buy it. So will the courts.
Yeah, the courts,

15:07.860 --> 15:10.530
where it's going to come out that
you're connected to the person

15:10.580 --> 15:12.570
who's much more likely to have
set up the ambush.

15:12.620 --> 15:16.090
There's no connection. You know what,
you're a good liar, Kate.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.330
Not good enough to fool me
when you were undercover,

15:18.380 --> 15:20.730
but good enough to hide that call.

15:20.780 --> 15:25.690
I'm so glad you did, cos you've made
yourself my ticket out of here.

15:25.740 --> 15:28.530
Well, whilst you're in here,
bouncing off the walls,

15:28.580 --> 15:31.730
our investigation rolls on,
day after day,

15:31.780 --> 15:34.090
gathering more evidence against you.

15:34.140 --> 15:36.410
For one, we'll find out
the real reason why you were

15:36.460 --> 15:38.410
sniffing around that garage.

15:38.460 --> 15:41.140
I told you. We'll see.

15:59.020 --> 16:03.090
We've both been here before.
So has Major Violent Crime.

16:03.140 --> 16:04.810
What matters is Denton came here.

16:04.860 --> 16:07.010
Yeah, following a missing persons
lead.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.490
This is the exact place
used by Tommy's killer.

16:09.540 --> 16:12.050
If that isn't a possible connection
between the two of them,

16:12.100 --> 16:13.140
I don't know what is.

16:23.340 --> 16:24.820
What?

16:40.940 --> 16:44.130
I searched this place.
It was flat.

16:44.180 --> 16:45.500
Well, it's not any more.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.050
Get the landlord on the phone.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.330
We need consent to get
a search team over here.

16:51.380 --> 16:53.250
Let's see what
comes from the garage.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.690
But now we've got access to
the witness protection files,

16:55.740 --> 16:56.810
we've got Tommy.

16:56.860 --> 17:00.050
We've got Akers, who was his WP
officer, and her phone records.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.650
And then we've got Denton.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.250
But nothing in either the files
or the phone history connects

17:04.300 --> 17:05.530
either party to Denton.

17:05.579 --> 17:06.930
All right?

17:06.980 --> 17:08.810
All right.

17:08.859 --> 17:09.900
You all right?

17:11.420 --> 17:13.660
So, Gaffer says you were
probies with Akers.

17:15.380 --> 17:18.930
Yeah, I went through Ryton with her.
Honest copper?

17:18.980 --> 17:20.140
Yeah.

17:27.020 --> 17:28.490
What?

17:28.540 --> 17:30.010
We're playing catch-up.

17:30.060 --> 17:33.090
Feels like everybody else got
first dibs on this one.

17:33.140 --> 17:35.370
First thing we did was look for
prior contact

17:35.420 --> 17:37.130
between Akers and Denton.

17:37.180 --> 17:39.690
They never worked together,
they never called each other.

17:39.740 --> 17:42.210
As far as we can tell,
they were complete strangers,

17:42.260 --> 17:44.850
never met until a few
minutes before the ambush.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.370
As per Denton's statement.
Yeah.

17:47.420 --> 17:50.090
There's a hell of a lot of evidence
against Denton.

17:50.140 --> 17:52.700
Oh, yeah, you're right. There is.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.410
Look, the gaffer's asked me
to do a job.

17:58.460 --> 18:00.610
It's not my fault you were kept
out of the loop.

18:00.660 --> 18:05.980
But really, around the office,
you ought to be calling me sir.

18:08.660 --> 18:09.890
Sir.

18:09.940 --> 18:11.060
Sir.

18:12.940 --> 18:15.580
Good. Have a nice day.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.570
Wanker.

18:19.620 --> 18:20.660
Twat.

18:21.780 --> 18:22.770
OK.

18:22.820 --> 18:25.410
According to Akers' phone records,
a few minutes beforehand,

18:25.460 --> 18:28.010
she called a number registered
to her husband.

18:28.060 --> 18:30.810
She calls home, says, "I might be a
little bit late tonight, love,"

18:30.860 --> 18:32.770
and then arranges the transfer
via Denton.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.970
Makes sense, but let's
talk to the husband anyway.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.690
Good idea.
I'll call him.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.330
No, it's fine, I'll do it.

18:38.380 --> 18:40.850
Do you mind if we set the interview
up for tomorrow though?

18:40.900 --> 18:43.140
Cos my Tesco's shuts at eight.
All right.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.300
Hi.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.530
In the morning, I'm going to
return to take a statement

18:58.580 --> 19:00.090
with my partner, Steve Arnott.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.450
You'll answer all our questions
fully and honestly,

19:02.500 --> 19:04.930
with the exception of disclosing
Jayne's request for you

19:04.980 --> 19:08.220
to contact me and the fact that you
did attempt to contact me.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.810
Right. OK.
OK.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.930
Kate...

19:14.980 --> 19:16.740
I get it.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.420
Last thing I want to do
is embarrass you.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.540
You picked a good day, Ted.

20:27.740 --> 20:30.010
We've got Bourbon Creams.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.140
Thanks very much, sir, but I'm fine.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.820
Why didn't you notify me
you were arresting DI Denton?

20:40.860 --> 20:42.570
I didn't realise I had to, sir.

20:42.620 --> 20:44.890
I thought we agreed
we were on the same team.

20:44.940 --> 20:46.210
We are, sir,

20:46.260 --> 20:49.050
it's just there's the principle of
non-reciprocity between...

20:49.100 --> 20:51.850
I'm managing one of the biggest
cases, if not the biggest,

20:51.900 --> 20:53.770
this force has ever seen.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.260
Every move's being watched
like a hawk.

20:59.220 --> 21:00.970
And may I ask if there's
any difficulty

21:01.020 --> 21:02.660
with Denton's arrest, sir?

21:05.260 --> 21:06.900
No, of course not.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.500
You did the right thing.

21:10.700 --> 21:14.930
Luckily, we've managed to play this
development in our favour.

21:14.980 --> 21:18.330
It's just that you would've
appreciated some forewarning, sir.

21:18.380 --> 21:20.010
That's all it is.

21:20.060 --> 21:23.290
Well, if I could just beg another
minute of your time, please, sir.

21:23.340 --> 21:24.330
Quickly.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.610
I'm going to send you the audio file
of the interview

21:26.660 --> 21:29.330
with DI Denton in which you'll hear
her levelling accusations

21:29.380 --> 21:33.090
intended to discredit
two AC-12 officers.

21:33.140 --> 21:35.290
DS Stephen Arnott

21:35.340 --> 21:38.130
is accused of having a liaison
with a witness, sir.

21:38.180 --> 21:39.220
It happens.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.540
OK. The second officer?

21:44.620 --> 21:46.450
Well, that would be me, sir.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.090
DI Denton obtained my financial
records and is accusing me

21:49.140 --> 21:54.490
of having high levels of undisclosed
financial losses, sir.

21:54.540 --> 21:57.890
Her actions in obtaining those
records are, in my opinion,

21:57.940 --> 22:00.170
unlawful, sir, but however,

22:00.220 --> 22:03.180
the information she has against me
is correct.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.380
I'm sorry. How did it happen?

22:08.620 --> 22:11.810
A retired colleague invited me
to invest in a property deal

22:11.860 --> 22:13.010
in the Irish Republic.

22:13.060 --> 22:15.340
I meant, how did
she access your records?

22:16.420 --> 22:18.740
That's still under
investigation, sir.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.450
You're aware the prosecutor's going
for public interest immunity

22:24.500 --> 22:27.330
against DI Denton?
I am, sir.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.850
And there's a chance they'll umbrella
AC-12's evidence

22:29.900 --> 22:32.610
with Witness Protection.

22:32.660 --> 22:35.490
It's possible this could all end up
being brushed under the carpet.

22:35.540 --> 22:37.340
That's out of my hands, sir.

22:42.380 --> 22:45.370
This must've been difficult
for you, Ted.

22:45.420 --> 22:46.900
It shows your integrity.

22:49.020 --> 22:51.010
Notwithstanding, I'm going
to have to consider

22:51.060 --> 22:52.460
how it affects your position.

22:55.300 --> 22:56.460
Of course, sir.

22:57.580 --> 22:58.620
Thank you, sir.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.890
Mr Akers, I'm DS Arnott.
DC Fleming you know.

23:07.940 --> 23:10.140
Hi. Hi, Kate. Hi.

23:11.940 --> 23:13.490
Come in.

23:13.540 --> 23:16.140
You two seen each other since...
The funeral? No.

23:17.060 --> 23:20.010
I'm, er... I'm very sorry
for your loss.

23:20.060 --> 23:22.850
Jayne left for work as normal
that morning.

23:22.900 --> 23:26.370
She didn't say anything
about there being anything

23:26.420 --> 23:29.690
unusual that she had to do that day.

23:29.740 --> 23:31.850
Did your wife ever discuss
the particular witness

23:31.900 --> 23:34.730
she was dealing with?
Not a word. Jayne didn't do that.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.930
DI Lindsay Denton. That a name
you ever heard from your wife?

23:37.980 --> 23:39.250
No.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.130
According to your wife's
phone records,

23:41.180 --> 23:44.370
she made a telephone call at exactly
8:43pm that evening.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.620
That your number?

23:48.380 --> 23:49.650
My mobile, yes.

23:49.700 --> 23:51.260
Do you recall what she said?

23:54.300 --> 23:56.650
She said that something
had come up at work

23:56.700 --> 23:59.290
and that she was going
to be home late.

23:59.340 --> 24:02.380
She said she'd call me later and let
me know how things were going.

24:06.300 --> 24:07.340
That's all?

24:09.340 --> 24:10.700
To the best of my recollection.

24:12.980 --> 24:16.930
Thank you, Mr Akers. We know
this is a difficult time for you.

24:16.980 --> 24:19.530
Your assistance has been valuable.

24:19.580 --> 24:20.740
I'll see you out.

24:25.220 --> 24:26.610
Sorry, Mr Akers.

24:26.660 --> 24:29.250
If someone's in fear of their life,
a police officer,

24:29.300 --> 24:31.610
then they do something about it.

24:31.660 --> 24:34.050
Was there anything she said,
an unusual turn of phrase,

24:34.100 --> 24:36.820
a name, anything, that might alert
someone to what was going on?

24:38.380 --> 24:40.370
There wasn't, no.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.660
Thanks again, Mr Akers.

25:05.220 --> 25:06.260
A word.

25:21.060 --> 25:24.010
You got something to say about the
interview with Akers' husband?

25:24.060 --> 25:25.820
Writing up the statement
for the boss.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.930
He's made me Deputy SIO

25:28.980 --> 25:32.090
so I'll take a look at it
when it's ready.

25:32.140 --> 25:33.850
Congratulations.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.530
You're worried it doesn't fit, hmm?

25:37.580 --> 25:41.490
Akers makes a random phone call to
Denton, and yet it's all Denton?

25:41.540 --> 25:43.530
That's why we're
looking for connections.

25:43.580 --> 25:46.660
Our side and your side,
and we haven't found one.

25:48.140 --> 25:51.810
Have you seen the preliminaries
on the search of Denton's house?

25:51.860 --> 25:54.730
Not one piece of incriminating
evidence.

25:54.780 --> 25:57.250
But I'm guessing summat wasn't right
with Akers' husband?

25:57.300 --> 25:59.620
Cup of tea.

26:02.140 --> 26:05.500
Look, I've put in a request
for financial forensics for...

26:08.780 --> 26:12.490
I've put in a request for financial
forensics for Akers' bank account.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.530
If she was getting
paid for information.

26:14.580 --> 26:17.410
Great minds think alike. Nice one.

26:17.460 --> 26:20.690
Well, Denton's in custody.
How's the boss going to react?

26:20.740 --> 26:22.010
Don't know, mate.

26:22.060 --> 26:24.930
I'm not sure how I feel about
sending an innocent copper down.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.620
I need my eight hours a night.

26:38.060 --> 26:39.570
Steve, what was that?

26:39.620 --> 26:40.660
Nothing. He's a twat.

26:41.980 --> 26:43.220
Stephen.

26:45.220 --> 26:46.260
Sir.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.340
Shut the door.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.260
Remain standing.

27:05.340 --> 27:08.250
I've been trying to figure out the
best way of dealing with this matter

27:08.300 --> 27:09.770
and frankly, I'd rather not have to.

27:09.820 --> 27:12.290
And I don't fancy talking to this
nurse about what happened

27:12.340 --> 27:14.290
between the pair of you.
So I'll start with you.

27:14.340 --> 27:16.130
This isn't relevant
to our investigation.

27:16.180 --> 27:19.450
Yes, it is, because we have
Denton on tape quoting the regs.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.290
She was clutching at straws.
She'll say anything to undermine us.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.770
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that?

27:24.820 --> 27:26.730
The nurse isn't a witness against
Denton.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.130
She's never even heard of her.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.090
Did you have inappropriate
relations with a witness?

27:31.140 --> 27:33.130
As I've said, sir,
she's not a witness.

27:33.180 --> 27:36.090
Not our witness, anyway, and MVC
aren't charging her as an accessory.

27:36.140 --> 27:38.330
So what are you saying, son?
What, she was fair game?

27:38.380 --> 27:41.330
I'm saying I know the difference
between screwing up an investigation

27:41.380 --> 27:42.450
and just screwing.

27:42.500 --> 27:45.490
There's discreditable conduct and
there's just plain right and wrong.

27:45.540 --> 27:48.610
Meaning? She was already under
threat for her little boy's life,

27:48.660 --> 27:50.210
she was in protective custody.

27:50.260 --> 27:52.410
If you've got a moral problem,
that's down to you.

27:52.460 --> 27:54.170
There's nothing wrong
with MY morality!

27:54.220 --> 27:56.410
I'm a single bloke and I've got
a normal private life.

27:56.460 --> 27:59.570
With respect, sir, you need a better
reason for having this conversation.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.650
How the hell are we supposed to
uphold standards

28:01.700 --> 28:04.210
if you're running around town
not upholding them yourself?

28:04.260 --> 28:06.820
That's my reason,
and it's a bloody good one.

28:08.740 --> 28:09.940
I'm disappointed, son.

28:11.500 --> 28:12.660
Go on, get out.

28:40.340 --> 28:42.570
Another bollocking?
That's all I need.

28:42.620 --> 28:46.130
No, I'll tell you
what you need. Come on.

28:46.180 --> 28:50.410
So, this nurse, she fit, was she?

28:50.460 --> 28:51.500
All right.

28:52.980 --> 28:55.370
Well? Did you?

28:55.420 --> 28:58.060
You need to brush up
your interrogation technique.

28:59.860 --> 29:01.850
Don't look now, right...

29:01.900 --> 29:04.730
What did I say about not looking?

29:04.780 --> 29:06.850
There's a couple of birds
behind you.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.780
Now, I'm not formulating a plan
or anything, but...

29:11.380 --> 29:12.730
There's three of them.

29:12.780 --> 29:16.450
I'm a bloody Detective Inspector,
I can see there's three of 'em.

29:16.500 --> 29:19.770
There's always one who's got a
boyfriend, on her period or summat.

29:19.820 --> 29:22.610
You were obviously off the day they
did gender awareness training.

29:22.660 --> 29:25.300
Hey. I GAVE the gender
awareness training.

29:28.780 --> 29:31.170
This is bloody weird, Dot.

29:31.220 --> 29:34.050
What, me and you working together?
Well, yeah.

29:34.100 --> 29:38.450
Well, that's Anti-Corruption, mate.
Beggars can't be choosers.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.690
And this is all on me, by the way.
No, honestly.

29:40.740 --> 29:43.330
We'll have no arguments.
First things first.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.780
All right, captain.

29:46.380 --> 29:47.530
Pop over there, yeah?

29:47.580 --> 29:49.930
Ask those lovely ladies what
we can get them to drink.

29:49.980 --> 29:52.060
No food, mind,
I'm not made of money.

29:55.660 --> 29:59.370
Bent bitch! Bent bitch! Bent bitch!

29:59.420 --> 30:02.490
Bent bitch! Bent bitch! Bent bitch!

30:02.540 --> 30:03.580
Bent bitch!

30:16.980 --> 30:19.180
Can you see it?

30:28.780 --> 30:30.290
Hi.
You all right?

30:30.340 --> 30:31.690
Yeah.

30:31.740 --> 30:33.690
So there's a body?

30:33.740 --> 30:36.130
We're taking it from here.
Sir?

30:36.180 --> 30:38.730
Our crime scene.
You're joking.

30:38.780 --> 30:40.690
It's our side of the investigation.

30:40.740 --> 30:41.850
That floor was collapsing

30:41.900 --> 30:44.210
because there's something underneath
it collapsing.

30:44.260 --> 30:47.770
It's thanks to Kate the subsidence
was even noticed.
Well, top marks for that.

30:47.820 --> 30:50.650
Sir, may I respectfully request any
findings be shared?

30:50.700 --> 30:52.490
Send your request to my office
in writing.

30:52.540 --> 30:56.010
Somebody will get back to you within
the next ten working days, OK?

30:56.060 --> 30:58.970
Yes, please, ladies and gentlemen.
It's OK. I've got it.

30:59.020 --> 31:01.060
Here it comes.

31:02.180 --> 31:04.100
Call me later for initial forensics.

31:07.820 --> 31:09.290
I've got it.

31:09.340 --> 31:10.860
Let's go.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.730
We're not making any announcement
about the body.

31:17.780 --> 31:18.890
'You sure, sir?'

31:18.940 --> 31:22.010
No. Not until we know how it fits
in with the overall investigation.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.530
Sorry, Andrew, I've got
another call incoming.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.570
'OK, boss.' We'll catch up
in the morning.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.620
OK. Love to Liz and the kids. Bye.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.130
Mike Dryden.
'Sorry, sir, it's Jo Rise.'

31:34.180 --> 31:36.210
New Jo, hi.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.370
'I'm afraid the Evening Herald
is going to run

31:38.420 --> 31:40.020
'the speeding ticket story.'

31:41.780 --> 31:46.010
I need to question you further in
regards to the industrial estate.

31:46.060 --> 31:47.690
What were you really doing there?

31:47.740 --> 31:50.850
I was investigating the
disappearance of Carly Kirk.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.450
As I've already stated.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.330
Ever been there before?

31:55.380 --> 31:58.740
Consorted with individuals
connected with the place? No.

32:00.700 --> 32:02.930
A body's been found buried under
the floor

32:02.980 --> 32:06.250
of the old A&B Carriage Repairs
industrial unit.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.940
Been there about two months.

32:09.340 --> 32:12.690
And your presence was what,
a coincidence?

32:12.740 --> 32:14.570
I was investigating the
disappearance...

32:14.620 --> 32:17.530
The men who carried out the ambush
were the same men who used the nurse

32:17.580 --> 32:18.970
to gain access to the hospital.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.490
Same target, same clothing,
motorcycle gear.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.530
They took the nurse to that garage,

32:24.580 --> 32:27.450
the same place where the
girl's body was buried.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.100
And you went there, too.

32:30.580 --> 32:35.610
Now, if this was your case, would you
write those off as coincidences?

32:35.660 --> 32:39.140
No. No. So, one way or another,
you're involved.

32:40.060 --> 32:41.140
No.

32:42.540 --> 32:45.780
The evidence is out there.
We will find it.

32:49.060 --> 32:51.260
A girl. What age?

32:53.020 --> 32:54.410
About 15.

32:54.460 --> 32:56.290
Carly Kirk?

32:56.340 --> 32:59.180
No ID yet, only initial forensics.
Why not?

33:00.740 --> 33:02.970
Her face and finger pulps were
burnt off

33:03.020 --> 33:06.250
using a high-temperature flame,
most likely a blowtorch.

33:06.300 --> 33:10.010
Her teeth were removed, postmortem,
most likely with pliers,

33:10.060 --> 33:12.540
preventing comparison of dental
records.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.410
Cause of death?

33:16.460 --> 33:19.530
Strangulation using some
kind of ligature.

33:19.580 --> 33:22.250
Can her DNA be compared to Carly's?

33:22.300 --> 33:25.010
There were control samples obtained
from her personal effects

33:25.060 --> 33:29.170
when she disappeared.
They haven't been traced as yet.

33:29.220 --> 33:30.340
They're lost?

33:32.220 --> 33:33.740
It's just an admin glitch.

33:36.620 --> 33:39.290
She was a nobody when she was alive.

33:39.340 --> 33:40.620
And dead, she's still one.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.140
Why are you so convinced it's her?

33:46.820 --> 33:49.210
Because of a lead I was following.

33:49.260 --> 33:52.730
The same lead that you think makes
out that I had to be in on it.

33:52.780 --> 33:54.410
I was only searching for Carly.

33:54.460 --> 33:58.580
Why? Of all the long-term mispers,
why her?

34:00.700 --> 34:03.340
She was... She was only recently
disappeared.

34:05.700 --> 34:07.420
There were leads.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.780
I thought we'd find her.

34:13.460 --> 34:16.179
I thought maybe there'd be some good
news for once in this job.

34:23.020 --> 34:24.260
Ma'am, what's wrong?

34:28.980 --> 34:30.730
Look.

34:30.780 --> 34:32.580
It's tough in here, on anyone.

34:36.300 --> 34:38.650
They told me about what happened to
your food.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.170
Maybe you could make sure that you

34:40.219 --> 34:42.020
only eat stuff out of a sealed
wrapper.

34:45.380 --> 34:48.650
They said that you requested
a piano keyboard.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.570
I'm sure that's something
we could look at.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.570
If you can co-operate with our
investigation,

34:52.620 --> 34:54.370
tell us things that we don't
already know,

34:54.420 --> 34:56.690
there's all sorts we can do to
improve your situation.

34:56.739 --> 34:58.210
I know why I'm in here.

34:58.260 --> 35:00.450
Because I picked up a phone.

35:00.500 --> 35:03.370
Because an officer in danger,
somebody I'd never even met before,

35:03.420 --> 35:06.730
requested my help and I did what any
decent police officer would do.

35:06.780 --> 35:09.490
Yeah, you did pick up a phone.
In a call box.

35:09.540 --> 35:13.570
To speak to the nurse who was looking
after the target of the ambush.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.770
And lied through your teeth
about it ever since.

35:15.820 --> 35:17.300
That's the reason you're in here.

35:22.780 --> 35:24.180
I shouldn't have lied.

35:26.860 --> 35:29.220
I realised how incriminating it
sounded.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.370
That I'd called the nurse.

35:32.420 --> 35:33.820
So you're admitting it?

35:37.060 --> 35:38.050
Yeah.

35:38.100 --> 35:41.250
Yeah. So what is your connection
with the nurse?

35:41.300 --> 35:42.340
None.

35:43.620 --> 35:46.610
It didn't take a genius to work out
where the witness was being treated.

35:46.660 --> 35:48.930
I made calls, always from phone
boxes.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.810
Pretended I was from a recruitment
agency

35:50.860 --> 35:53.730
asking for the names of nurses who
worked on the intensive care unit.

35:53.780 --> 35:55.010
Why?

35:55.060 --> 35:58.220
Because he had to know who was in on
it, who was after him.

35:59.220 --> 36:00.650
I wanted to know if he'd spoken,

36:00.700 --> 36:03.140
if he'd said anything that could
prove my innocence.

36:05.340 --> 36:07.010
Is that the best you can
come up with?

36:07.060 --> 36:09.450
It's the truth!
Well, it sounds...

36:09.500 --> 36:14.010
What? Pathetic? Desperate?
Yeah.

36:14.060 --> 36:17.130
I wasn't even supposed to
be on duty that night.

36:17.180 --> 36:18.450
I was covering.

36:18.500 --> 36:22.050
I did that a lot, for the inspectors
with families.

36:22.100 --> 36:25.090
It was my way of trying to
get on, I suppose.

36:25.140 --> 36:27.300
Pathetic. Desperate.

36:30.060 --> 36:33.410
I need you to amend your statement,
ma'am, to go on record

36:33.460 --> 36:36.970
with what you've just admitted
regarding the phone call.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.380
I'm happy to.

36:40.420 --> 36:42.140
Just as soon as you do the same.

36:45.940 --> 36:48.730
Does the Deputy Chief Constable have
a statement to make regarding

36:48.780 --> 36:51.610
the allegation about his speeding
offence in the Evening Herald?

36:51.660 --> 36:54.250
The subject of this briefing is
the ongoing investigation

36:54.300 --> 36:57.130
into the ambush in which three
police officers lost their lives.

36:57.180 --> 36:58.850
Are you still the best
man for the job?

36:58.900 --> 37:01.180
I will give a brief statement.

37:02.180 --> 37:05.490
My wife and I strenuously
deny the allegation.

37:05.540 --> 37:09.090
The fact that...in the midst
of what is clearly a complex

37:09.140 --> 37:10.850
and controversial investigation,

37:10.900 --> 37:15.090
the Herald chooses to trot out this
inaccurate slur... Will you resign?

37:15.140 --> 37:18.300
Is your position untenable?

37:19.900 --> 37:21.530
Is your position untenable?

37:21.580 --> 37:23.940
Have you still got the
chief constable's backing?

37:32.420 --> 37:34.060
Makes a change from
a minging subway.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.890
You all right?

37:36.940 --> 37:38.690
Get you a drink?

37:38.740 --> 37:40.460
No, I better not have any more.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.820
Have mine.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.260
What's wrong?

37:49.780 --> 37:51.660
Rich Akers is hiding something.

37:54.780 --> 37:56.980
On the night of the ambush,
he called me.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.540
What'd he call you about?

38:02.820 --> 38:05.170
A message from Jayne.

38:05.220 --> 38:06.930
She needed to speak to me.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.500
About moving the witness?

38:10.740 --> 38:12.100
Why'd you hide it?

38:17.060 --> 38:19.660
Rich and I were involved
behind Jayne's back.

38:23.580 --> 38:25.260
I didn't want it coming out.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.660
Who else you told?

38:36.300 --> 38:37.770
No-one.

38:37.820 --> 38:39.210
Keep it that way.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.490
You draw a line around it

38:40.540 --> 38:42.770
and you walk away from it
like it never happened.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.330
Steve... This'd be your career.

38:44.380 --> 38:46.380
You see a life for yourself
outside the job?

38:47.820 --> 38:49.140
No.

38:51.980 --> 38:54.100
Richard Akers -
he won't blab about this?

38:55.620 --> 38:57.490
He hasn't so far.

38:57.540 --> 38:59.170
Good.

38:59.220 --> 39:00.690
Down that, I'll get you home.

39:00.740 --> 39:02.420
Lindsay Denton knows.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.620
That's what all that business
was with your phone.

39:14.100 --> 39:17.100
She went through my call history,
using it as leverage.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.450
Your version of events is -
Richard Akers called you

39:28.500 --> 39:30.170
because he was
worried about his wife.

39:30.220 --> 39:32.690
It didn't materially affect
the investigation. End of.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.380
Steve, that's a lie.

39:35.460 --> 39:38.290
Maybe there are some people out
there who always tell the truth

39:38.340 --> 39:39.450
and ones who always lie.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.450
The rest of us choose our moments.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.620
This is one of them.

40:00.220 --> 40:02.900
The allegation about me
and my wife won't go away.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.330
If you've thrown back a denial,

40:06.380 --> 40:08.650
often there's a delay while
they get corroboration.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.930
Screw them.

40:09.980 --> 40:11.700
I've got a bigger story for you.

40:14.540 --> 40:17.370
The person charged in connection
with the ambush,

40:17.420 --> 40:19.130
the 36-year-old woman -

40:19.180 --> 40:20.530
she's a police officer.

40:20.580 --> 40:24.090
Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton
from the Missing Persons Unit

40:24.140 --> 40:25.620
at 4th Street Station.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.820
She led the convoy into the ambush...

40:32.140 --> 40:35.300
..and conspired in the
witness's murder at the hospital.

40:37.180 --> 40:39.730
'Is it correct that
Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton

40:39.780 --> 40:42.340
'has been charged with
conspiracy to murder?

40:43.700 --> 40:47.010
'I'm not going to be drawn into
elaborating on press speculation.'

40:47.060 --> 40:50.460
God help me, when I find the leak,
I'm going to bury the bastard.

40:51.620 --> 40:52.780
How'd they get this?

41:04.980 --> 41:07.850
Have you understood
the safety briefing? Yeah.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.050
You must complete
two sessions per week

41:10.100 --> 41:12.170
of no less than 15 minutes each

41:12.220 --> 41:14.770
and no more than 30 minutes each.

41:14.820 --> 41:17.650
Answering "Yes" or "No" only,
do you understand?

41:17.700 --> 41:19.340
Which machines can I use?

41:21.020 --> 41:22.340
Yes.

42:01.540 --> 42:03.220
Help me!

42:11.060 --> 42:12.380
No!

42:18.180 --> 42:19.220
N..! No!

42:20.940 --> 42:22.260
No!

42:27.740 --> 42:29.330
Bloody hell, Jen, quick!

42:29.380 --> 42:30.900
You two, get away from her!

42:36.220 --> 42:37.260
Have a seat.

42:43.980 --> 42:45.490
Look, if anyone finds out,

42:45.540 --> 42:47.290
we're for the high jump.

42:47.340 --> 42:48.890
We'll sort out those two back there

42:48.940 --> 42:50.730
and we can keep this
between ourselves?

42:50.780 --> 42:51.850
Yeah, sure.

42:51.900 --> 42:53.970
Cheers. You're a life-saver.

42:54.020 --> 42:55.060
Fancy a cuppa?

42:56.220 --> 42:57.770
Yeah, that'd be
really nice, thanks.

42:57.820 --> 43:00.010
Jen, can you do the paperwork
and I'll do the brew?

43:00.060 --> 43:02.250
No problem, Al. Lindsay...

43:02.300 --> 43:04.530
Is it OK if I call you Lindsay?

43:04.580 --> 43:06.970
Yeah, sure. Lindsay, could you
pop your hands on the table

43:07.020 --> 43:09.010
next to this diagram
so I can have a look at them?

43:09.060 --> 43:10.370
Milk, sugar?

43:10.420 --> 43:12.180
Yeah. Milk, no sugar, please.

43:13.940 --> 43:16.370
You've got a cracked nail.

43:16.420 --> 43:18.900
Could've been worse, I suppose.
Thank God it wasn't!

43:21.580 --> 43:24.130
You've been talking to AC-12.

43:24.180 --> 43:27.850
From now on, you keep your gob shut.

43:32.020 --> 43:33.340
Sir...

43:34.980 --> 43:37.620
Thank you, Ted, but there's no need.
Hat off, at ease.

43:38.620 --> 43:39.980
Sir.

43:42.900 --> 43:46.020
I've considered the pros and cons
with no little deliberation.

43:47.020 --> 43:48.620
You're in a vulnerable position.

43:50.180 --> 43:52.930
An anti-corruption officer is more
likely than most to encounter

43:52.980 --> 43:55.650
situations that place him
susceptible to bribery.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.060
Sir.

43:59.100 --> 44:01.890
However, coming to me as you did...

44:01.940 --> 44:03.540
is a mark of your character.

44:06.220 --> 44:08.290
This is...

44:08.340 --> 44:11.130
possibly the most morally
complex investigation

44:11.180 --> 44:12.580
this force has ever carried out.

44:15.060 --> 44:18.570
I, for one, would feel
less confident of success

44:18.620 --> 44:21.340
without your guiding hand
on the tiller.

44:22.460 --> 44:23.860
I'd like you to carry on.

44:26.860 --> 44:28.340
I don't know what to say, sir.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.730
I haven't discussed
this with anyone.

44:31.780 --> 44:34.580
I think the fewer people know
about your situation, the better.

44:35.580 --> 44:37.690
Very grateful, sir. Thank you, sir.

44:37.740 --> 44:39.170
Is there anything I can do to help?

44:39.220 --> 44:40.340
No, no, sir, no.

44:41.700 --> 44:43.930
The wife and I are
back on track, sir.

44:43.980 --> 44:45.300
Good man, glad to hear it.

44:54.540 --> 44:56.980
Charged anyone else while
our backs have been turned?

44:59.060 --> 45:01.770
Very interesting question, sir.

45:01.820 --> 45:03.530
Should I have?

45:03.580 --> 45:05.860
Must be great up
there on that pedestal...

45:06.980 --> 45:08.380
..all holier-than-thou.

45:11.260 --> 45:12.980
All the further to fall, mind...

45:14.100 --> 45:15.650
..when the truth comes out.

45:18.980 --> 45:20.420
Les. Sir.

45:44.820 --> 45:46.810
All right, boss. All right.

45:46.860 --> 45:48.210
What you having?

45:48.260 --> 45:49.300
Oh, it's my shout.

45:50.820 --> 45:52.620
Pint of Kronenbourg. Ta.

45:54.940 --> 45:58.090
I imagine I'm keeping you
from your busy social life.

45:58.140 --> 45:59.580
Could do with a night off.

46:03.340 --> 46:04.940
You seeing that nurse again?

46:06.380 --> 46:08.530
Sir, you and I see certain
things differently.

46:08.580 --> 46:10.620
That doesn't mean
there isn't respect.

46:11.820 --> 46:13.540
Except for my personal views.

46:15.180 --> 46:16.420
Some.

46:18.820 --> 46:20.060
We were married at 18.

46:23.300 --> 46:24.900
She was the only one.

46:26.100 --> 46:27.290
And we waited.

46:27.340 --> 46:28.900
Is that what you don't respect?

46:38.500 --> 46:41.370
I spoke to you, sir,
in the wrong manner.

46:41.420 --> 46:43.210
I apologise.

46:43.260 --> 46:45.930
I'd be grateful if you could see
your way to putting it behind us.

46:45.980 --> 46:47.300
You would, would you?

46:48.580 --> 46:51.250
Well, I guess it'd be rude not to.

46:51.300 --> 46:52.540
Don't want to be rude.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.540
I disappointed you, sir.

47:00.660 --> 47:02.460
Sometimes I disappoint myself.

47:12.420 --> 47:13.740
Welcome to the club.

47:56.020 --> 47:57.180
Are you in much pain?

47:58.500 --> 47:59.580
Yes.

48:01.820 --> 48:03.580
What've they said about your hands?

48:04.900 --> 48:08.170
The medical officer doesn't know
how bad they'll be.

48:08.220 --> 48:10.140
He's referred me to a specialist.

48:11.420 --> 48:12.460
I'm sorry.

48:13.460 --> 48:16.210
I heard there was a problem
with the CCTV recording.

48:16.260 --> 48:17.500
Conveniently.

48:20.020 --> 48:22.370
DI Denton, I'd like to take
a statement from you today

48:22.420 --> 48:24.010
to be included in evidence,

48:24.060 --> 48:28.130
regarding your amendments to earlier
statements given in evidence.

48:28.180 --> 48:30.370
We had an agreement about that.

48:30.420 --> 48:31.810
Are you aware the prosecution's

48:31.860 --> 48:33.890
made a Public Interest Immunity
application?

48:33.940 --> 48:36.170
It was brought up
at my bail hearing.

48:36.220 --> 48:38.490
Well, it's been accepted.

48:38.540 --> 48:42.050
They've got non-disclosure
of sensitive evidence.

48:42.100 --> 48:45.290
Included in said sensitive evidence

48:45.340 --> 48:46.460
is my call history.

48:47.860 --> 48:49.330
They can't do that.

48:49.380 --> 48:52.970
I was an undercover officer
gathering evidence against you.

48:53.020 --> 48:56.090
Disclosure of my communications
history could jeopardise

48:56.140 --> 48:59.650
undercover contacts and future ops.
That's just not true!

48:59.700 --> 49:00.970
It's a cover-up!

49:01.020 --> 49:04.810
Our legal team did their job.
I'm just here to do mine. Now...

49:04.860 --> 49:06.570
in regards to the
phone call you made...

49:06.620 --> 49:08.820
What, so your phone call
from Akers gets vanished?

49:10.140 --> 49:13.290
Like the CCTV of me being
attacked by two inmates,

49:13.340 --> 49:15.650
like those same
two inmates testifying

49:15.700 --> 49:17.330
that I burned my own hands

49:17.380 --> 49:19.530
and that the prison officers
tried to stop me?

49:20.860 --> 49:23.410
It suits everyone for me
to be silenced.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.810
I'm taking your statement, aren't I?

49:25.860 --> 49:27.250
Look, this attack -

49:27.300 --> 49:29.050
it's opened my eyes.

49:29.100 --> 49:32.290
I was set up to get involved
in the transfer of the witness.

49:32.340 --> 49:34.890
The newspaper leak about me,
the attack,

49:34.940 --> 49:37.090
and now the
non-disclosure of evidence -

49:37.140 --> 49:39.570
it all makes sense,
even the screws are involved.

49:39.620 --> 49:42.050
They said as much. They said what?

49:42.100 --> 49:43.330
They said not to talk to you.

49:43.380 --> 49:44.900
What, what we're doing now?

49:45.980 --> 49:47.730
No-one appears to be stopping us.

49:47.780 --> 49:49.130
No, but...

49:49.180 --> 49:52.210
Look, you've been badly
shaken by the attack.

49:52.260 --> 49:54.810
Maybe it's best I come
when you're feeling better.

49:54.860 --> 49:56.130
No, wait.

49:56.180 --> 49:58.010
Listen to me.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.490
Don't you see how I've been set up?

50:00.540 --> 50:02.250
Even down to the fact that AC-12

50:02.300 --> 50:04.810
were prevented from looking
at witness protection.

50:04.860 --> 50:06.660
All you could do was focus on me.

50:08.420 --> 50:11.460
Now, only somebody at executive
level has that kind of power.

50:12.660 --> 50:15.540
And the only person I told about
the operation was Mike Dryden.

50:19.740 --> 50:22.980
You've lied through your teeth
throughout this investigation...

50:24.260 --> 50:26.690
..and now you're
using an exec officer

50:26.740 --> 50:28.490
as a way of tying us in knots.

50:28.540 --> 50:30.380
No, that's not what is it! Really?

50:34.260 --> 50:35.490
I know Mike Dryden.

50:35.540 --> 50:36.580
You "know" him?

50:37.700 --> 50:39.090
We had an affair.

50:39.140 --> 50:40.180
Five years.

50:42.220 --> 50:43.460
And?

50:47.060 --> 50:48.580
And?

50:58.020 --> 50:59.820
He didn't leave his wife, did he?

51:00.900 --> 51:02.250
You gave him an ultimatum

51:02.300 --> 51:03.860
and then it was all over.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.130
You and I both know that
you don't have the right

51:07.180 --> 51:09.020
to act superior over
our private lives.

51:10.540 --> 51:12.090
Why are you only
telling us this now?

51:12.140 --> 51:13.930
Because I don't know
myself if it's true!

51:13.980 --> 51:15.370
Why would he do that to me?

51:15.420 --> 51:16.570
I've done nothing to him.

51:16.620 --> 51:18.210
If anything, I've protected him.

51:18.260 --> 51:20.810
No, you're a woman scorned.

51:20.860 --> 51:22.970
Not only do you get
your revenge on him,

51:23.020 --> 51:26.170
but you use him as a way of
screwing up our investigation.

51:26.220 --> 51:27.930
Do you believe that I'm guilty?

51:27.980 --> 51:31.970
I just gather the evidence.
The courts decides. I get it.

51:32.020 --> 51:33.250
I get it.

51:33.300 --> 51:34.850
It's your way of
dealing with the fact

51:34.900 --> 51:37.060
that you might be putting away
an innocent person.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.580
I think you're guilty.

51:59.860 --> 52:03.900
Bent bitch! Bent bitch!

53:03.660 --> 53:04.850
DC Fleming.

53:04.900 --> 53:08.450
'Jan Evans. You left a message
regarding the 4th Street duty logs.'

53:08.500 --> 53:10.330
Yeah. Thanks for getting back to me.

53:10.380 --> 53:13.210
I'm seeking information regarding
the rota for duty inspector

53:13.260 --> 53:15.780
at 4th Street Station on
the night of September 5th.

53:16.820 --> 53:17.970
'You mean...'

53:18.020 --> 53:19.730
Yeah, the night of the ambush.

53:19.780 --> 53:22.380
'I have that information on file.
Please hold.'

53:25.380 --> 53:27.290
Dot's up to something.

53:27.340 --> 53:28.770
One minute.

53:28.820 --> 53:30.610
'DI Denton covered the ghost rota

53:30.660 --> 53:33.100
'as Inspector Barlow was
reassigned that night.'

53:34.380 --> 53:36.730
Who was responsible
for that change?

53:36.780 --> 53:38.300
'Hold one second.'

53:42.020 --> 53:44.450
'Inspector Barlow received
an invitation to attend

53:44.500 --> 53:46.290
'a session of the Crime Executive.

53:46.340 --> 53:49.860
'It came directly from Deputy
Chief Constable Dryden's office.'

53:51.700 --> 53:52.980
Great, thank you.

54:02.620 --> 54:03.900
What's going on?

54:08.260 --> 54:09.970
Well?

54:10.020 --> 54:12.450
We've got the financial
forensics back in.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.690
Looks like Jayne Akers

54:13.740 --> 54:16.010
was on the receiving end
of a substantial payment.

54:16.060 --> 54:17.050
How substantial?

54:17.100 --> 54:18.500
Upwards of 50 grand.

54:23.340 --> 54:24.530
We need to include Kate.

54:24.580 --> 54:26.130
Akers was her mate.

54:26.180 --> 54:27.690
And Kate's my partner.

54:27.740 --> 54:28.820
Steve!

54:38.500 --> 54:42.450
Under Rule 46, vulnerable persons
must shower alone.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.130
From the dispensers on the wall,

54:44.180 --> 54:45.890
you're permitted one measure of soap

54:45.940 --> 54:47.770
and one measure of shampoo.

54:47.820 --> 54:50.370
You must shower in no
longer than six minutes.

54:50.420 --> 54:53.500
Answering only "Yes" or "No",
do you understand?

54:59.460 --> 55:00.620
What is it?

55:01.700 --> 55:04.170
Lindsay alleged she was set up
by another police officer.

55:04.220 --> 55:05.530
I've gone back through her file

55:05.580 --> 55:08.530
and she served with this officer for
nearly a year back when she was a DS,

55:08.580 --> 55:10.010
working in crime audit.

55:10.060 --> 55:12.170
He was a chief superintendent.

55:12.220 --> 55:14.530
I've just taken a call from
one of the administrators

55:14.580 --> 55:16.100
at 4th Street Station and...

55:21.500 --> 55:22.810
..on the night of the ambush,

55:22.860 --> 55:26.010
this particular officer
caused the rota to be changed,

55:26.060 --> 55:28.410
the change that put
Lindsay Denton on duty that night.

55:28.460 --> 55:29.730
He was a chief super?

55:29.780 --> 55:31.250
What is he now?

55:31.300 --> 55:32.700
Deputy chief constable.

55:34.340 --> 55:35.770
It's Mike Dryden.

55:35.820 --> 55:38.810
Oh, Jesus bloody Christ. Dot...

55:38.860 --> 55:40.170
Yeah, I need a breather.

55:40.220 --> 55:43.060
One wrong move and we could
all be directing traffic.

55:46.700 --> 55:47.980
Well? Steve?

55:49.460 --> 55:50.810
All right.

55:50.860 --> 55:53.260
But first I need to talk
to you about Jayne Akers.

56:08.300 --> 56:10.970
'How are you?
You do not have to say anything.

56:11.020 --> 56:12.010
'Tickety-boo.

56:12.060 --> 56:14.930
'You sit there and you try and twist
some case out of my misfortunes.'

56:14.980 --> 56:17.170
'Status Zero! Status Zero!'

56:17.220 --> 56:19.970
'Three of our colleagues have lost
their lives in the line of duty.

56:20.020 --> 56:22.130
'All I did was do my job.
It was no accident, was it?

56:22.180 --> 56:24.170
'Three of our own in the
morgue because of you.

56:24.220 --> 56:25.410
'No firearms? No backup!

56:25.460 --> 56:28.170
'The officer plunged five floors
and is reported to have died.

56:28.220 --> 56:30.170
'Denton, I am arresting
you for conspiracy...

56:30.220 --> 56:31.970
'Take away the one
good thing in my life.

56:32.020 --> 56:35.540
'I think you're guilty.'

56:44.700 --> 56:45.860
No.

57:12.380 --> 57:15.900
I'm delighted that significant
progress is being made.

57:17.260 --> 57:19.010
The net is closing in.

57:56.180 --> 57:57.780
I believe you.
