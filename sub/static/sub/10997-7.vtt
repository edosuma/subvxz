he is the guy

him or her, and I chose her.

he had feelings.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.037
and I'm just looking
to crash for the night

12:17.070 --> 12:19.773
and I get there
and I'm about to say...

12:19.807 --> 12:20.607
And...

12:21.008 --> 12:25.212
He looks at me like,
"Why are you here?"

12:28.949 --> 12:29.950
"Tony hit me."

12:31.418 --> 12:33.320
My Dad gets up,
he grabs his keys

12:33.353 --> 12:35.155
and we go
right to my mom's.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.924
He marches right up
to that couch

12:36.957 --> 12:38.258
where fat Tony is sitting,

12:38.291 --> 12:41.194
watching that fucking TV
on his God damn couch

12:42.229 --> 12:44.064
-and he decks him.
-(CHUCKLES) Shit.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.199
And again, and again.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.268
Tony is fucking bleeding.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.404
He's on the ground
and my dad starts kickin' him.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.206
You don't mess
with a guy's kid.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.108
My mom, she's crying...

12:55.876 --> 12:59.813
Screamin'. And I could've
just stopped it

12:59.847 --> 13:01.114
at any time.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.385
All I had to do
was tell the truth.

13:10.858 --> 13:11.859
You were a kid.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.164
Deakins deserved
so much better.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.901
So, somehow you feel
responsible for her death?

13:26.273 --> 13:27.841
Were you in love with her?

13:27.875 --> 13:28.876
(SIGHS)

13:31.544 --> 13:33.513
I never got the chance
to find out.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.222

13:43.556 --> 13:44.925
Give me the mom's address.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.396
I gotta make a call.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.536
-PATRICK: It's me.
-Did you get anything?

13:56.569 --> 13:58.872
Yeah, I got an address.
And guess what?

13:58.906 --> 14:01.308
Sadie did time
for hacking the NSA.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.043
Cut a deal.
She served 16 months.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.311
That seems light.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.948
Well, she ratted out
her partner, Mia Sanders.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.116
They never found her.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.252
Maybe Sadie's not as loyal
as Mia thinks.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.954
That's our in, Patrick.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.488
You call me
when you find her.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.407
Wow, you showing up like this,
it's getting to be a habit.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.176
You could've called.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.978
Oh, no, you can't,

14:38.011 --> 14:39.479
'cause some asshole
bugged my phone.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.449
You wanna tell me
what this is about?

14:42.482 --> 14:43.483
Yeah.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.255
They know
you have the chip, Clea.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.023
And they want it back.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.127
That's never
going to happen.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.362
Hmm.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.663
Mmm, we'll see.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.599
What is this,
a pissing contest?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.168
No, it's a proposition.

15:02.169 --> 15:05.072
We work together to figure out
who these people are.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.174
Okay, you're forgetting one
small detail.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.541
I don't trust you
as far as I can spit.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.977
Yeah? Well, you got
a long line of people

15:10.010 --> 15:11.278
you can trust right now?

15:11.611 --> 15:12.980
Meaning?

15:13.313 --> 15:15.382
They know you didn't
put the chip in evidence.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.218
Which means they have people
on the inside.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.586
But I'm sure you already knew
that, right, Clea?

15:22.255 --> 15:23.390
Listen to me.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.459
The chip and the warehouse,
they're connected.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.128
How do you know that?

15:28.161 --> 15:29.596
Because the same guy
that killed Oaks

15:29.629 --> 15:31.698
is the same guy that asked me
to get the chip back.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.735
Look, there was another guy,

15:35.768 --> 15:37.637
other than the two bangers.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.572
They shot him, too.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.741
Only three bodies
were recovered.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.576
Okay, then they moved
the body, what can I tell you?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.611
Why?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.346
I don't know.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.648
But what I do know
is he didn't belong there.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.985
This guy was 50s,
white, preppy.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.120
I mean, he looked like
he came off

15:53.153 --> 15:54.187
a fucking golf course.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.756
He had a polo shirt,
with an insignia

15:56.789 --> 15:58.591
that read "Wilton Point."

15:58.625 --> 16:00.327

-Yeah.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.261

16:01.294 --> 16:03.563
It's a country club,
just north of the city.

Where are you going?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.302
I'm going to Wilton Point.
You coming?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.672
You're inviting me along
on my case?

16:12.705 --> 16:13.773
Yeah, that's right.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.642
I'm the only one who knows
what he looks like. Come on.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.539
-Welcome.
-Hi, how are you?

16:46.739 --> 16:49.209
-Mr. and Mrs. Lewis.
-Pleased to meet you.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.710
We're here to meet
with the club director

16:50.743 --> 16:51.778
about membership.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.012
Oh.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.649
Ah, yes. If you could
wait here a moment.

16:56.683 --> 17:01.054
-Sure.
-I never got it, golf.

It's a nice walk spoiled.

All right, what time
are we supposed to be

17:09.762 --> 17:10.763
meeting this guy?

17:13.533 --> 17:14.567
At 10:02.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.239
You know what, just give me
a minute, will you?

17:19.272 --> 17:20.673
Excuse me, sir.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.743
The par three, seventh,
is it really a four iron?

17:24.311 --> 17:25.712
If you're Dustin Johnson.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.214
That's what I was saying
to Henry.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.582
-Henry? Harris or Davenport?
-Harris.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.783
We're actually supposed to
tee off at 2:00.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.385
Please, after you.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.622
Which means he'll show up
about 1:57.

17:35.655 --> 17:36.723
Oh, really?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.691
-Buy you a drink?
-Yeah, please.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.860
-What do you want?
-Uh, I'll take a beer.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.229
-Beer.
-Thanks.

-Two beers.

I'm not being hustled.

being hustled.

he says his handicap is,

with him before.

Oh, Ralph.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.623
-Ralph, uh...
-Lunsford.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.293
-That's right.
-He can't putt worth shit.

Thanks again for the beer.

a fucking spine surgeon.

How do you run out?
It's the special.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.309
It was that special,
that's how.

-Enjoy.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.187
Huh.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.221
What?

18:42.222 --> 18:44.157
Ralph Lunsford was reported
missing this morning

18:44.191 --> 18:45.392
by his partner Neil Everett.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.227
Partner meaning boyfriend?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.462
As in neurological surgeon.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.465
Fuck, that makes sense.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.633
It does?

18:53.666 --> 18:56.203
Yeah, the chip was implanted
in her brain.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.506
What are you talking about?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.212
Okay, look,
I can't help you

19:05.245 --> 19:06.879
if you don't
share information with me.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.315
You mean trust you?

19:08.781 --> 19:10.383
Whatever you wanna call it.
All right?

19:16.623 --> 19:17.624
Okay.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.863
The chips were implanted
into the girls' hands.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.433
At first, we thought
it was like a GPS.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.467
But these things,

19:27.500 --> 19:29.336
they can measure
biometric data.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.971
They might even be able to
affect behavior,

19:32.004 --> 19:34.207
tolerance to pain,
that kind of thing.

19:34.807 --> 19:35.842
One of the girls,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.644
she had a chip implanted
in her brain.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.349
What the fuck
is wrong with people?

19:43.550 --> 19:44.751
I tried to have
the chip analyzed.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.419
It's classified.

19:46.453 --> 19:49.222
-As in national security.
-Really?

they have pull.

see the surgeon.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.336

will you?

the little prodigal prick.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.523

"why don't you give me
all my money early, please?

21:43.436 --> 21:45.672
He gives his kid
his early inheritance,

21:45.705 --> 21:46.673
and what does the kid do?

21:46.706 --> 21:49.809

he brushes his teeth

21:59.151 --> 22:01.020
he doesn't
have one fucking shekel

22:01.053 --> 22:02.822
for a God damn cup of coffee.

-I'm so sorry.
-(SHUSHING) Hey, hey, hey.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.590
I just got scared.
I was so scared.

35:58.624 --> 35:59.891
Hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

35:59.925 --> 36:03.362
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here.
Okay?

36:03.562 --> 36:04.696
(SNIFFLES) Okay.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.866
I just went
to go see Kelly.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.702
We hit the jackpot.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.341
$10 million.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.375
(GASPS)

36:18.310 --> 36:19.611
-Jesus.
-(CHUCKLES)

36:23.014 --> 36:24.350
(BOTH MOAN)

36:26.985 --> 36:29.388
-Ten?
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.258
You know,
she's gonna kill you.

36:33.024 --> 36:36.228
If you think
that I'm gonna walk in there

36:36.262 --> 36:37.629
without an exit strategy,

36:38.864 --> 36:40.666
you don't know me
very well, Patrick.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.668
I'm all ears.

36:44.002 --> 36:47.339
Babe, you're walking
into a trap.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.907
Oh, come on,

36:49.975 --> 36:51.810
it's me
you're talking to here.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.480
You think
I don't have a plan B?

37:02.454 --> 37:06.358
Wow. This place
really is a shit hole.

37:06.392 --> 37:07.726
(BOTH LAUGH)

37:07.759 --> 37:09.227
You just don't see
the potential.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.663
I suppose
you have the vision...

37:11.697 --> 37:13.699
And the rest of the world's
wearing bifocals.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.634
I bet you believe that, too.

37:16.502 --> 37:17.503
(CHUCKLES)

37:18.003 --> 37:20.272
-You want a drink?
-Yeah.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.642
-I'll have a whiskey sour.
-A whiskey sour.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.811
I don't think I have any eggs.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.713
Oh, lemon and sugar
will be just fine.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.847
Coming up.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.549
So...

37:30.582 --> 37:32.384
Turns out Neil Everett

37:32.418 --> 37:34.820
sits on the board
of a trafficking charity.

37:34.853 --> 37:35.821
You're shitting me.

37:35.854 --> 37:39.791
Mmm-mmm. What can I say?
Charity begins at home.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.560
That piece of shit knows
everything there is to know

37:41.593 --> 37:42.828
about trafficked girls.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.564
Including turning them
into guinea pigs.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.968
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

37:51.337 --> 37:53.339
So, do you think
they're in on it together?

37:54.373 --> 37:55.607
I don't know.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.377
Feel like there's
a lot of money involved,

37:58.410 --> 38:00.779
one of them gets greedy,
they fall out...

38:00.812 --> 38:02.581
Or Lunsford
grew a conscience,

38:02.614 --> 38:03.982
he didn't want any part of it,
so they killed him.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.353
Question is,
who is "they"?

38:07.386 --> 38:09.388
(CLICKS TONGUE)
That is the question.

38:12.824 --> 38:13.992
What?

38:14.526 --> 38:15.827
Nothing.

38:15.861 --> 38:16.995
No, what is it?

38:17.028 --> 38:18.029
(CHUCKLING)

38:18.897 --> 38:19.998
I was just thinking,

38:20.031 --> 38:21.400
we made
a lot of progress today.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.436
Mmm-hmm, we did, yeah.

38:24.470 --> 38:25.771
You would've made a good cop.

38:26.672 --> 38:27.773
Maybe.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.541
(EXHALES)

38:29.775 --> 38:30.776
Ooh.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.913
That shot really hit me.

38:37.383 --> 38:38.884
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

38:39.751 --> 38:41.520

41:53.979 --> 41:55.013
You ready?

41:59.585 --> 42:00.586
I'm in.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.589
You play me, Kelly,

42:05.056 --> 42:06.892
and it's good night,
and thank you.

42:40.726 --> 42:42.761
-Marty.
-(EXHALES)

42:43.194 --> 42:44.663
Wow, nice.

42:44.696 --> 42:46.832
Tell you what,
this city mouse is lovin' him

42:46.865 --> 42:49.034
some of this country air, huh?

42:49.067 --> 42:50.268
Thirsty?

42:50.301 --> 42:52.137
Yeah, I'll have me
one of those.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.905
Seems like
you're in a good mood.

42:54.973 --> 42:56.141
Yeah, you know,

42:56.174 --> 42:58.576
the prospect of money
does that to me.

42:59.044 --> 43:01.747
You must be
the Cheshire-fucking-cat

43:01.780 --> 43:03.181
what with this price tag.

43:04.883 --> 43:05.951
I'm not making
a dime, Marty.

43:08.654 --> 43:12.057
MARTY: Really? Why may I ask
are you doing this?

43:13.258 --> 43:14.860
It's for a friend.

43:16.061 --> 43:18.096
-Huh.
-Oh, yeah.

43:18.129 --> 43:20.131
You know what?

43:20.165 --> 43:22.033
Someone needs
a refresher course

43:22.067 --> 43:25.270
on Marty's law of living
a meaningful and happy life.

43:25.303 --> 43:27.005
-Oh, yeah?
-Chapter one...

43:27.038 --> 43:28.840
Self-acceptance.
Look at me.

43:28.874 --> 43:32.210
I am a venal,
power-hungry fucker.

43:32.243 --> 43:33.311
Right?

43:33.344 --> 43:34.913
I live with that,
I accept it.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.414
I recite it
three times every morning

43:36.447 --> 43:37.916
before I brush my teeth.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.719
And look at me.
I'm a fucking Federal Judge.

43:42.253 --> 43:44.122
Yeah, well, I'm not you.

43:44.690 --> 43:45.724
(CHUCKLES)

43:46.825 --> 43:48.960
You ever hear the story
of the scorpion and the frog?

43:48.994 --> 43:50.061
Yeah, third grade.

43:50.095 --> 43:51.730
Oh, not my version,
you haven't.

43:51.763 --> 43:52.798
(SCOFFS) Go ahead.

43:53.431 --> 43:56.201
Once upon a time,
there was a scorpion

43:56.234 --> 43:57.402
named Mr. S,

43:57.435 --> 43:59.404
and he fell in love
with this babe,

43:59.437 --> 44:01.807
who lived across on the
other side of the river,

44:01.840 --> 44:03.241
but he can't get
to the other side,

44:03.274 --> 44:05.243
so he asks his buddy,
Freddy the Frog,

44:05.276 --> 44:06.344
if he could get

44:06.377 --> 44:07.679
a lift to the other side
of the river.

44:07.713 --> 44:09.781
Now, Freddy's
very squeamish.

44:09.815 --> 44:12.017
And he says,
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. S,

44:12.050 --> 44:15.253
"but my mommy told me never,
ever to pick up hitchhikers,

44:15.286 --> 44:17.222
"and by the way, as soon
as you get on my back,

44:17.255 --> 44:19.257
"you're gonna sting me,
I know it for sure."

44:19.457 --> 44:22.093
Now, Mr. S,
he's very smart,

44:22.127 --> 44:23.394
and he thinks
things through.

44:23.929 --> 44:25.130
So he says to Freddy,

44:25.731 --> 44:27.398
"If I hop on your back,
I sting you,

44:27.432 --> 44:28.934
"we're both goners,
I'm gonna drown.

44:28.967 --> 44:31.737
"Are you out of your mind?
Why would I do that?"

44:31.770 --> 44:33.104
So, he gives in.

44:33.138 --> 44:36.474
Now, Mr. S hops
on Freddy's back,

44:36.507 --> 44:37.909
they get three quarters

44:37.943 --> 44:39.344
to the other side
of the river...

44:39.377 --> 44:41.112
Now, what do you
think happens?

44:41.146 --> 44:44.082
Mr. Scorpion stings Freddy
and they both drown.

44:44.115 --> 44:46.051
(LAUGHING)

44:46.084 --> 44:47.418
You see,
you are not listening.

44:47.452 --> 44:48.987
-You are not listening.
-I'm listening.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.255
-No, you're not listening.
-I'm listening.

44:50.288 --> 44:52.190
I told you, Mr. S,
he's smart, right?

44:52.223 --> 44:53.291
He thinks things through.

44:53.324 --> 44:55.126
Yeah, of course,
he stings him,

44:55.160 --> 44:57.328
but then,
he hops on a lily pad,

44:57.362 --> 44:58.463
gets to the other side,

44:58.496 --> 45:00.398
he bangs
his babe's brains out.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.300
(CHUCKLES)

45:03.501 --> 45:06.271
-I like the original, better.
-Well, it's a true story.

45:06.304 --> 45:08.073
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

45:09.140 --> 45:10.441
Point being...

45:12.243 --> 45:15.280
You and me, Ethan,
we're scorpions.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.015
We sting,

45:17.048 --> 45:18.884
because it's our nature
to sting.

45:18.917 --> 45:22.320
We sting, and we are
better off for it.

45:29.194 --> 45:30.428
Man, that guy can talk.

45:30.461 --> 45:32.497
And most of it, utter shit.

45:39.838 --> 45:42.440
-So this guy, he's a...
-Adnan Kraja.

45:42.473 --> 45:44.876
This is your average
Albanian arms dealer?

45:44.910 --> 45:46.211
Yeah, very average,
very colorful.

45:46.244 --> 45:47.478
How colorful?

45:48.446 --> 45:51.116
Well, he'll stick
a fork in your heart,

45:51.149 --> 45:52.517
and pull it out himself.

45:53.151 --> 45:55.086
You know what they're gonna do
with the chip?

45:55.120 --> 45:56.387
What do you care?

45:56.421 --> 45:57.889
I was curious.

45:57.923 --> 46:00.291
Marty's second law...
"Don't ask, don't tell."

46:05.430 --> 46:08.099
-The less said, the better.
-Right.

46:24.515 --> 46:27.018
Adnan, how are you?

46:28.519 --> 46:30.088
Yeah.

46:42.567 --> 46:43.869
Where is it?

46:44.602 --> 46:46.204
There you go.

46:48.606 --> 46:51.276
It doesn't look like
10 million dollars.

46:51.609 --> 46:53.478
Well, I can take it elsewhere
if you like.

46:53.511 --> 46:56.447
He talks a lot
when he shouldn't talk at all.

47:01.252 --> 47:03.221
Hmm. Hmm...

47:04.089 --> 47:07.292
It's smaller than the one
Moscow's developing.

47:12.430 --> 47:13.598
(SIGHS)

47:15.967 --> 47:17.302
I thought there'd
only be one.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.536
It's not a problem.

47:19.504 --> 47:22.007
As soon as the money's there,
give me the word.

47:37.122 --> 47:39.991
If this thing doesn't work,
I know where to find you.

47:40.591 --> 47:41.859
Where would you
like the money?

47:45.931 --> 47:47.198
Here, Marty.

48:11.456 --> 48:13.624
What the fuck is taking
so long?

48:13.658 --> 48:15.293
He's transferring the money.

48:21.532 --> 48:23.034
Is it there, yet?

48:23.068 --> 48:24.235
Can I take the shot?

53:02.947 --> 53:04.482
Now, go on.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.984
So, what are you
gonna do now?

53:41.018 --> 53:43.321
I've got some
unfinished business

53:43.354 --> 53:44.589
back in town.

53:46.056 --> 53:47.325
How about you?

53:48.459 --> 53:49.727
I don't know.

53:50.928 --> 53:52.697
I kinda like the West Coast.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.500
Maybe I'll see you around.

53:56.701 --> 53:58.969
That's probably
not a good idea, Patrick.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.406
No, it's probably not.

54:03.508 --> 54:04.842
You take care of yourself.
