[GRUNTING]

11:05.239 --> 11:06.874
[KNOCKING]

11:08.002 --> 11:09.142
Mary Charles.

11:09.153 --> 11:10.920
M-CHUCK: Hey, Pookie, what's going on?

11:10.931 --> 11:13.537
What's going on?
It's 9:00 and you're in Boston.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.740
Yeah. Guess I should have called first,

11:15.750 --> 11:17.775
sent a text or something.

11:17.785 --> 11:19.509
Hey listen, quick question.

11:19.519 --> 11:21.014
You know anything about what happened

11:21.025 --> 11:23.227
to my mother that night on Long Island?

11:24.491 --> 11:26.160
It looks wet out there. Come in.

11:27.143 --> 11:30.059
You're right, I wasn't thinking.
I should have called or something first.

11:30.070 --> 11:31.713
I'm sorry about that.

11:33.058 --> 11:35.664
I really need you to tell me the truth.

11:35.675 --> 11:38.532
- Not sure what you're talking about.
- See, you can't pause like,

11:38.543 --> 11:40.863
"Oh, shit," and then be all "Not
sure what you're talking about,"

11:40.874 --> 11:42.199
'cause when you paused your
face sorta said, "Oh shit,"

11:42.209 --> 11:44.201
like you did know what
I was talking about.

11:44.211 --> 11:46.336
You didn't scrunch up
your face confused,

11:46.346 --> 11:48.005
so cut the bullshit.

11:48.015 --> 11:49.840
Ma told Cam my existence on Earth

11:49.850 --> 11:52.342
started with a sexual
assault on Long Island.

11:52.352 --> 11:54.811
What do you know about that?

11:54.822 --> 11:57.014
For what it's worth,
you've yet to offer me a beverage.

11:57.024 --> 12:00.084
I got water, coffee, Diet Dr. Pepper.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.429
Is the coffee made, or is it
gonna be like a whole process?

12:03.798 --> 12:06.166
Diet Dr. Pepper, please.

12:10.871 --> 12:12.807
Is what Ma said true?

12:18.478 --> 12:19.598
You wearing a wire?

12:19.609 --> 12:21.104
If you're worried I'm wearing a wire,

12:21.115 --> 12:22.324
some shit really went down.

12:22.335 --> 12:23.504
I didn't say that.

12:23.515 --> 12:26.255
So what is it, some opportunistic
ploy to get me to show you my tits?

12:26.266 --> 12:27.576
For God's sakes, Mary Charles!

12:27.587 --> 12:30.380
It's fine. You tell me who raped
my mother, I'll show you my tits.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.516
- I don't want to see your tits!
- I got great tits.

12:32.526 --> 12:33.851
You're my dead friend's niece.

12:33.861 --> 12:35.385
All grown up with a great rack.

12:35.395 --> 12:36.520
Anyway, you like girls.

12:36.530 --> 12:38.022
My titties don't know that.

12:38.032 --> 12:40.024
In a vacuum, titties
ain't straight or gay.

12:40.034 --> 12:42.526
Mine are perfect. You'd be
grateful to see how perfect.

12:42.536 --> 12:43.928
I can see titties whenever I want.

12:43.938 --> 12:45.462
- Bullshit.
- I can.

12:45.472 --> 12:46.831
Bullshit.

12:46.841 --> 12:48.833
Right now, if I want to see some titties

12:48.843 --> 12:50.968
I can walk next door,
tell Yolanda I'm good to go

12:50.978 --> 12:53.881
and I'd have a face full
of titties in six seconds.

12:54.701 --> 12:56.765
So she's just sitting over
there on titty standby?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.275
Amongst other things she's juggling.

12:58.285 --> 13:00.845
She's a bookkeeper.
She's active on black Twitter

13:00.855 --> 13:02.412
and volunteers at church.

13:02.422 --> 13:04.648
My titties are better.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.593
Titties are in the eyes of the beholder.

13:06.793 --> 13:07.952
And no disrespect,

13:07.962 --> 13:09.519
there's no use in me looking at titties

13:09.529 --> 13:12.022
that I ain't gonna do nothing with.

13:12.032 --> 13:15.816
Pook, my conception is a dark
hood mystery with few facts.

13:15.827 --> 13:17.785
The one clue I got is
that my ma told Cam

13:17.796 --> 13:19.453
that some friends drove
her to Long Island

13:19.464 --> 13:22.399
and what I know is that you were the
one with the car back in the day.

13:22.409 --> 13:24.602
I know you and Julius
and my ma and my aunt

13:24.613 --> 13:27.071
partied when you were younger,
so if my mother was in a car

13:27.081 --> 13:28.939
driving to Long Island from Boston,

13:28.949 --> 13:30.875
the likelihood that you
were driving that car

13:30.885 --> 13:32.715
that took her to that
first party is high.

13:32.726 --> 13:34.845
But since my uncle is dead
and my mother is in China

13:34.855 --> 13:37.915
I am sitting here
seeking answers from you

13:37.925 --> 13:40.149
on who impregnated my
mother against her will.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.019
And even though that
pregnancy resulted in me

13:42.029 --> 13:43.820
I am gonna find them and I am gonna go

13:43.830 --> 13:45.089
full fucking Munich on them,

13:45.099 --> 13:46.957
but I need to know where to start.

13:46.967 --> 13:49.093
Munich. You talking about
the Spielberg movie

13:49.103 --> 13:50.757
where the dudes chase
down the other dudes

13:50.768 --> 13:53.007
- that killed the Israeli Olympians?
- Yes.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.975
Violent flick.

14:00.514 --> 14:02.272
Call your ma.

14:02.282 --> 14:05.209
- For what?
- I don't know. Ask her.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.312
Ma's in Shanghai, and she told
me never to bring this up again.

14:08.322 --> 14:10.991
So why aren't you listening to her?

14:12.692 --> 14:15.852
CAMILLE: Missy, you can't be taping
old photos on punching bags.

14:15.862 --> 14:18.222
You're gonna make a difficult
situation more difficult,

14:18.232 --> 14:20.390
and you're gonna make
your husband difficult.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.066
[STAMMERING] I'm just saying.

14:23.077 --> 14:24.929
MISSY: It's not that
Reggie is difficult.

14:24.939 --> 14:27.397
It's just that life can be.

14:27.407 --> 14:29.099
One's past can be,

14:29.109 --> 14:30.400
and more for him than me.

14:30.410 --> 14:32.369
Well, the burden is on each individual

14:32.379 --> 14:35.705
to lead a worthy life
regardless of pedigree.

14:35.715 --> 14:37.507
Please go to another room.

14:37.517 --> 14:39.343
I know Reggie hurts,

14:39.353 --> 14:41.345
but what's difficult

14:41.355 --> 14:43.280
is that he won't let me in to help.

14:43.290 --> 14:46.083
He tells me I don't understand,
because I got great parents.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.552
CAMILLE: Now, I agree.
You've got great parents.

14:48.562 --> 14:52.656
But... this is what happens when the
genesis of a marriage is rebellion.

14:52.666 --> 14:54.724
Love was the genesis.

14:54.734 --> 14:57.294
Pursuing what one believes is love

14:57.304 --> 15:00.097
despite one's instincts is rebellion.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.732
My instincts are spotless.

Opposites attract, but they also repel.

of the House in six hours.

15:08.515 --> 15:11.041
Mom, I married Reggie
because I love him,

15:11.051 --> 15:13.177
not because he wasn't the kind of man

15:13.187 --> 15:14.912
you expected me to marry.

15:14.923 --> 15:16.706
Being in love and having
incredibly bad ideas

15:16.717 --> 15:18.649
are not mutually exclusive...

- CAMILLE: but the following is indisputable.

15:20.627 --> 15:23.187
Any woman who thinks she
possesses the antidote

15:23.197 --> 15:25.722
to fix a man who was
essentially constructed

15:25.732 --> 15:27.791
in an abusive and rotten environment

15:27.801 --> 15:30.060

just a little too much.

And don't give me that look like a
man can't be right about such things,

Take me off speaker.

18:10.197 --> 18:12.088
Okay, done.

18:13.934 --> 18:16.226
that I was gonna talk about

to me about the thing,

18:20.774 --> 18:22.599
I confirmed that it was true,

18:22.609 --> 18:24.401
and then I told you that I did not want

18:24.411 --> 18:26.436
to talk about the thing anymore.

Sometimes I think that when life
forces you to confront your past,

19:09.523 --> 19:11.581
there can be joy and
discovery in the knowing,

Listen, if it's the last
useful thing I ever say,

21:08.455 --> 21:12.815
please let me call you
an Uber or a taxi,

21:12.825 --> 21:15.462
but don't drive this car in
the condition you're in.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.069
You lying about being off the booze?

21:23.303 --> 21:24.737
Five years.

21:35.415 --> 21:37.907
My love, rise and shine.

21:37.917 --> 21:41.210
Mother had the servants
make some American coffee.

21:41.220 --> 21:44.414
Aw, Mama Chen. She's so thoughtful.

21:44.424 --> 21:46.316
Mother and Father are out.

21:46.326 --> 21:47.984
Let's retire to my teenage bedroom.

21:47.994 --> 21:51.298
I've never had sex in there
with anyone else but myself.

21:52.365 --> 21:53.723
[PHONE RINGING]

21:53.733 --> 21:55.258
Ooh!

21:55.268 --> 21:57.727
My son! My shining light.

21:57.737 --> 21:59.729
Hey, Ma.

21:59.739 --> 22:01.240
Ma...

22:01.974 --> 22:03.966
I just saw Rodney.

22:03.976 --> 22:05.535
Rodney who?

22:05.545 --> 22:08.106
Rodney Barker. I'm in Boston.

22:08.848 --> 22:09.896
Oh.

22:11.951 --> 22:13.543
Oh, with your sister?

22:13.553 --> 22:17.514
- She's in Boston.
- What's M-Chuck doing in Boston?

22:17.524 --> 22:19.258
Putting me in a bad mood.

22:20.527 --> 22:22.485
Chen, can you excuse
me for a minute, baby?

22:22.495 --> 22:24.531
I'm gonna go shower. Meet me.

22:25.598 --> 22:27.824
Oh, don't eat the white spongy stuff.

22:27.834 --> 22:29.492
Stick to the duck.

22:29.502 --> 22:31.538
The duck is the stuff
that looks like ham.

22:32.271 --> 22:33.540
Okay.

22:35.475 --> 22:37.400
What's up with you two mopey kids

22:37.410 --> 22:40.403
placing so much importance
on who got me pregnant?

22:40.413 --> 22:43.373
Well, in M-Chuck's case, she still
doesn't know exactly who that is.

22:43.383 --> 22:46.543
- CASSIE: Exactly don't matter.
- My case, Rodney's half of me.

22:46.553 --> 22:48.978
Oh, no, no, no. Hell, no.

22:48.988 --> 22:50.780
He ain't fucking half of you.

22:50.790 --> 22:53.783
If he had half your ass
growing inside of his belly,

22:53.793 --> 22:56.386
then he pushed you through
the tip of his dick,

22:56.396 --> 22:58.087
then maybe I would give
him half the credit

22:58.097 --> 22:59.288
for having half of you.

22:59.298 --> 23:01.233
But no, the mother has the egg.

23:01.434 --> 23:02.555
Learn your science.

23:02.566 --> 23:03.793
I know science, Ma.

23:03.803 --> 23:06.396
Well, then you would know
that I hatched the egg

23:06.406 --> 23:08.431
that turned into you, okay?

23:08.441 --> 23:10.633
You came from my egg. Mine!

23:10.643 --> 23:13.503
The shell, the white part,
the yolk, mine.

23:13.513 --> 23:16.573
That convict's contribution
was nothing more

23:16.583 --> 23:19.008
than the paprika shit they
sprinkle on deviled eggs.

23:19.018 --> 23:21.511
Don't be making that
motherfucker into the yolk.

23:21.521 --> 23:23.546
Ma, that ain't how DNA works.

23:23.556 --> 23:25.348
Half the genetic
material comes from you,

23:25.358 --> 23:26.950
and then the other half comes from him.

23:26.961 --> 23:28.418
Read the Internet.

23:28.428 --> 23:30.820
I still got your DNA floating
around inside of me.

23:30.830 --> 23:33.590
Rodney doesn't even have
the powdered prison eggs

23:33.600 --> 23:35.892
that he ate this morning in his ass.

23:35.902 --> 23:37.894
Shit!

23:37.904 --> 23:39.639
Oh, man, you kids!

23:41.007 --> 23:43.533
Look, [STAMMERING] you
got all this money now,

23:43.543 --> 23:47.136
and you're distracted with
this trivial bullshit!

23:47.146 --> 23:48.605
- [MURMURING]
- Trivial.

23:48.615 --> 23:51.708
So how was your visit
with your dear old Pops?

23:51.718 --> 23:54.076
He said he wrote me
letters when I was 11.

23:54.086 --> 23:55.378
Did he?

23:55.388 --> 23:56.813
He may have. I can't recall.

23:56.823 --> 23:59.382
I was too busy raising
you and your sister

23:59.392 --> 24:00.683
to be the overly-inquisitive

24:00.693 --> 24:03.219
nosy-ass little shits you turned into.

24:03.229 --> 24:05.455
Okay, so he wasn't a total deadbeat.

24:05.465 --> 24:08.525
Oh, God, he's a convict.

24:08.535 --> 24:10.760
Stop trying to make him into
something that he's not

24:10.770 --> 24:14.541
just because you're sad that
you lost in the playoffs!

24:15.616 --> 24:18.167
Look, baby, he was a boy

24:18.177 --> 24:20.470
that I met at a fair.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.172
And that I had sex with nine times,

24:23.182 --> 24:24.674
many, many summers ago.

24:24.684 --> 24:27.376
You want to have a chit-chat
with him? Go ahead.

24:27.386 --> 24:29.211
Have at it. Pen-pal it out.

24:29.221 --> 24:31.581
Matter of fact, why don't you
go put some money on his books

24:31.591 --> 24:33.683
or maybe toss a ball in
the prison play yard.

24:33.693 --> 24:36.453
But don't you dare call me here

24:36.463 --> 24:38.455
all the way in China trying to blame me

24:38.465 --> 24:40.449
for some shit that I did
many, many years ago

24:40.460 --> 24:43.470
when all I was trying to do
was make shitty ends meet.

24:44.771 --> 24:48.097
You know what,
if you are done judging me,

24:48.107 --> 24:50.900
I'm gonna go take the new
vagina that you bought me,

24:50.910 --> 24:53.345
and I'm gonna go have sex
with my billionaire boyfriend

24:53.546 --> 24:55.448
in his teenage bedroom.

25:00.553 --> 25:02.545
There were three of them.

25:02.555 --> 25:05.948
Two brothers and their cousin.

25:05.958 --> 25:07.860
15, 16 years old.

25:09.662 --> 25:12.298
Your uncle went to find
her the next morning,

25:12.499 --> 25:15.592
he found her walking.

25:15.602 --> 25:18.928
She had a lot of bruises,

25:18.938 --> 25:20.863
and a lot of scrapes.

25:20.873 --> 25:23.576
She had rope burns on her wrists.

25:24.811 --> 25:27.313
What the fuck? How did
they get away with it?

25:27.547 --> 25:28.848
They didn't.

[PHONE BUZZING]

26:02.244 --> 26:03.283
Hey, Ma.

26:04.712 --> 26:06.534
He did write you.

26:07.153 --> 26:09.245
What?

26:09.255 --> 26:11.614
CASSIE: He did write you.

26:11.624 --> 26:13.366
Why didn't you ever tell me?

26:13.377 --> 26:14.669
Because you were the type of kid

26:14.680 --> 26:16.653
who would commit a crime
if you thought it would

26:16.663 --> 26:18.187
allow you to live with him in prison.

26:18.197 --> 26:19.556
Did you save any of them?

26:19.566 --> 26:20.646
CASSIE: For a time.

26:20.657 --> 26:22.291
At the apartment on Washington and Reed.

26:22.301 --> 26:24.093
You don't remember us getting evicted?

26:24.103 --> 26:26.829
Who moved in there? Like, why wouldn't
they have forwarded the mail?

26:26.839 --> 26:30.066
Would you stop applying rich
man logic to the ghetto?

26:30.076 --> 26:32.268
I mean, have you forgotten
about where we come from?

26:32.278 --> 26:35.137
We got evicted in the middle
of a fucking blizzard.

26:35.147 --> 26:39.542
I'm sorry, baby. I mean,
he did write you, for a time.

26:39.552 --> 26:42.211
You were 12, but almost
nothing up until then.

26:42.221 --> 26:44.513
But you never told me he did.

26:44.523 --> 26:46.315
Cam, I wasn't who I am now.

26:46.325 --> 26:48.317
You weren't who you now are,

26:48.327 --> 26:50.653
and he is... He's where he is.

26:50.663 --> 26:52.789
And that's all I can say, baby.

26:52.799 --> 26:55.725
That, and that I-I'm sorry
that you're hurting.

26:55.736 --> 26:57.261
I'm sorry if you feel

26:57.272 --> 26:59.143
that this is part of the
reason why you're hurting.

26:59.154 --> 27:01.297
I'm sorry for not being

27:03.542 --> 27:05.301
or who can't remember to grab the shit

27:05.311 --> 27:06.803
that she was hiding from you

27:06.813 --> 27:09.682
because she got evicted during
a motherfucking blizzard.

27:11.951 --> 27:16.679
And there weren't that many,
like 10 or 20 or something.

27:16.689 --> 27:19.616
Look, you are a man now.
I can't tell you

27:19.626 --> 27:21.684
what you should and shouldn't be doing,

27:21.694 --> 27:24.153
or who you should or
shouldn't be visiting.

27:24.163 --> 27:25.755
But I raised you, son.

27:25.765 --> 27:28.591
And it wasn't easy. I know, Ma.

CASSIE: Well, it's good to be
reminded, even for a famous man.

27:31.704 --> 27:33.796
I raised you.

27:33.806 --> 27:35.564
I made sacrifices.

me before she died.

My brother helped me before he died.

27:42.715 --> 27:46.308
That's how hard a job
it is raising a kid.

27:46.318 --> 27:47.810
People die from doing it!

27:47.820 --> 27:50.847
- So don't forget them.
- I won't. I don't.

27:50.857 --> 27:53.215
CASSIE: Good. Go visit
your grandmother's grave.

27:53.225 --> 27:54.784
Go visit your aunt's grave.

27:54.794 --> 27:56.285
Put some flowers there.

They are the ones who did a bunch,

27:58.130 --> 28:00.122
not Rodney.

28:00.132 --> 28:04.360
The only shit he did was the shit
that put him where he is now.

Don't stay up there for long.

We've been all good
since we left Boston.

28:08.407 --> 28:10.733
Boston is in the past.

28:10.743 --> 28:13.612
Don't bring your past
into your right now.

Okay, baby?

28:15.614 --> 28:17.740
- Yep.
- CASSIE: I love you. Be good.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.171

28:19.182 --> 28:21.409
you and your sister need to
cut it with the curiosity

of us don't get gang raped.

We won't get there till 2:00,
3:00 in the morning.
