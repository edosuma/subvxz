00:02.721 --> 00:07.634
In tonight's Top Gear:
Mick Jagger among supercar.

00:08.339 --> 00:12.462
The search continues for the
fastest faith in Britain.

00:12.463 --> 00:17.537
A Stig drives a new TVR's compartment.

00:20.594 --> 00:25.700
Hello and welcome to the big
Christmas holiday edition of Top Gear!

00:25.701 --> 00:33.184
As you can see, we've spent a lot of money
on Christmas twig, orange and walnuts.

00:35.987 --> 00:38.282
Ode ball.

00:40.547 --> 00:47.971
Let's forget about Christmas,
let's talk about the big shiny SUVs.

00:47.972 --> 00:54.966
Most of them are bought by people who live
in cities that when they go to the country,

00:54.967 --> 01:00.092
think it will fit. Really?

01:03.357 --> 01:11.327
This is the village. It is brown and
old scenery, mainly such residents.

01:13.525 --> 01:18.724
These cars driving in rural areas.
Junk with wheels.

01:18.725 --> 01:24.514
Muddy, tough vehicles that are kept
in one piece with the rod and rope.

01:26.918 --> 01:32.301
It's hard to fit in here,
if I do not live here.

01:36.437 --> 01:41.379
This is my truck.
This is the Toyota Land Cruiser Amazon.

01:41.380 --> 01:46.669
It was built to be able to go through
Africa and Australia, so it is not a problem

01:46.670 --> 01:53.300
to drive the kids to school in Oxfordshire.
It has seven seats, thresholds and other

01:53.301 --> 01:58.491
still a feeling of invincibility.
When driving this narrow road,

01:58.492 --> 02:01.946
another driver gets out of the way.

02:03.086 --> 02:09.543
You can use it for hunting, but I do not
recommend it. Not that we should not van

02:09.544 --> 02:15.066
Asphalt, great, but it just does
not fit into the landscape, somehow.

02:18.508 --> 02:24.655
Hunting is a traditional sport where the
winner gets dinner, and the loser went hungry.

02:24.656 --> 02:28.795
Here's just you,
your serenity and peace of the forest.

02:28.796 --> 02:35.126
The smoke comes from the pipes,
light rain softens the edges.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:46.047 --> 02:51.634
In this traditional scene Land
Cruiser is somehow prešljašteći.

02:51.635 --> 02:57.973
You see, this is green,
and this is Toyota's concept of green color.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.539
So just do not go.

03:02.477 --> 03:07.083
BMW X5 is also hopeless,
but for another reason.

03:07.084 --> 03:11.981
Yes, it is big and has a drive to
all four wheels, but that's the end.

03:11.982 --> 03:18.992
Not even off-road tires, and it is as
if you have come here in high heels.

03:20.222 --> 03:28.319
This car is Milli Vanilli, looks good,
but it is only an imitation.

03:29.313 --> 03:34.338
Even the gentlest field is stuck,
a tip will visit you

03:34.339 --> 03:37.486
in the old Land Rover and
we will die from laughter.

03:38.454 --> 03:43.479
Even if you are the Marquis of Blenforda.
-Don't This is not perfect?

03:43.641 --> 03:47.016
How much is worth the Land Rover? 30,000?

03:47.718 --> 03:52.127
Well, I'll be fair, worth 200,000 pounds.

03:52.128 --> 03:55.566
And this is worth 50,000
pounds and got stuck.

03:55.567 --> 04:01.010
What is your?
-Truper. -Is Truper passes? -O yes.

04:14.858 --> 04:18.283
Remarkably, as the Land Rover my age.

04:18.284 --> 04:22.496
And the only men to climb.
I can not climb up this hill.

04:22.497 --> 04:26.587
He's better than me.
The worst has passed BMW.

04:26.588 --> 04:33.909
You beat BMW for 10 meters. So much less walking.
-That's right.

04:38.692 --> 04:43.719
What about the jeep Grand Cherokee?
Surprisingly, the US auto,

04:43.720 --> 04:48.724
it is extremely reticent and drowns
in the environment Oskfordšira.

04:48.725 --> 04:53.355
I was good in difficult terrain.

05:02.443 --> 05:08.717
He's good, but there are a few problems.
It gives a sense of agrikulturan.

05:08.718 --> 05:15.516
This is not to blame because it is still an
SUV. What I resent is bad skin on the seats,

05:15.517 --> 05:22.642
This horrible fake wood.
And it is not at all big inside as you think

05:22.643 --> 05:27.727
when you see it from the outside.
But the worst thing about it,

05:27.728 --> 05:32.811
the feeling that you have
purchased second-best.

05:49.082 --> 05:55.856
The new Range Rover is more than
20,000 pounds Džipa. These days more

05:55.891 --> 06:02.057
luxury yacht than a car. But do not worry,
it is still ready for roughness.

06:06.100 --> 06:12.422
Look at this. To hand this switch to turn
on the control of descent from the mountain.

06:12.423 --> 06:19.476
Expelling speed, involve reducer,
belting into gear now

06:20.777 --> 06:26.206
I'll just focus down this
seemingly impossible slope.

06:29.936 --> 06:35.902
Now I'm going to do something that you think
it's crazy. I'll take your foot off the brake.

06:41.539 --> 06:46.812
That's amazing.
I feel that ABS control each wheel

06:46.813 --> 06:50.349
and looking to keep a straight line.

06:50.350 --> 06:56.644
I maintain walking speed while descending.

06:59.443 --> 07:07.787
Of course, the X5 can do and he has
control of the descent, it's stolen BMW

07:07.788 --> 07:12.717
while they were masters Rover,
but what can the X5 to turn

07:12.718 --> 07:20.647
and climbed back up the hill.
X5 does reducer. No differential lock.

07:20.648 --> 07:26.336
No this height above the ground and the
size of the wheels. He is not a true SUV.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.628
And this really is.

07:30.888 --> 07:39.432
There's something else. Range Rover van
Savoy looks good, but looks even better here.

07:47.260 --> 07:52.148
At one time the Range Rover
was the king of the field.

07:52.149 --> 07:57.132
I still have a successor on the
same invincibility, but believe me,

07:57.356 --> 08:02.571
they will still be stuck, very.

08:04.632 --> 08:06.424
See what I mean?

08:06.425 --> 08:10.548
First he tried to pull out Blenford lord.

08:12.155 --> 08:17.052
Yet it was in his garden.
But he deteriorated thing

08:17.053 --> 08:22.129
and the next attempt one of the locals,
but his pickup was stuck in a puddle.

08:24.197 --> 08:31.744
Then I drove the Land Cruiser. In a hurry
I ran out and ended up in the woods.

08:32.693 --> 08:37.453
The point is that these
gilts should not be here.

08:38.821 --> 08:43.307
How do we get him out? Why do we laugh?

08:43.308 --> 08:48.738
This morning you said you can not go anywhere.
That's right, you see that has passed here.

08:49.990 --> 08:56.822
While we were cutting the trees around Toyota,
arrived in a tractor to pull the Range Rover.

08:57.158 --> 09:03.086
But even he had problems. This is a
problem when shooting in the countryside.

09:03.087 --> 09:09.092
There's too much mud. All the cars
are drawn and we are back to work

09:09.093 --> 09:13.477
explaining why the Range Rover so good.

09:13.478 --> 09:20.559
You see, there are real wood here
and here and hand-stitched leather,

09:20.560 --> 09:26.839
and finishing the interior
provides the best in all cars ever

09:26.840 --> 09:34.686
just like that. It's like you're in the
middle of a fancy restaurant in Notting Hill.

09:34.687 --> 09:38.541
I am here as a tangible feeling.

09:42.257 --> 09:48.885
The conclusion is that if you want to take
something old SUV, with a rough cube tires.

09:48.886 --> 09:57.781
If you want something for the weekend,
they are all good, but one stands out.

09:59.047 --> 10:03.651
The only car that is not jammed the jeep.
No he is. We did not see.

10:03.686 --> 10:11.682
You did not, because he drove a cameraman.
-So, Range Rover is the best,

10:11.683 --> 10:17.328
despite the fact that 20,000 more expensive than
Džipa? Add details are stunning development.

10:17.329 --> 10:23.962
Let me show you, the steering wheel has
heating. A push of a button and heats up.

10:23.963 --> 10:30.738
And even better is having a
paraffin heater that you can program

10:30.739 --> 10:35.891
on a computer that dare say,
in six hours if you go to work at seven,

10:35.892 --> 10:38.622
so it's nice when you get hot.

10:38.623 --> 10:43.610
I fear that this might be the
most boring sentence ever said

10:43.611 --> 10:48.864
on British television, but sometimes had
a two-piece chassis, is now one piece.

10:48.865 --> 10:53.968
And you know exactly what it means.
-So That less curl.

10:53.969 --> 10:57.629
There are smart additions, and that's
great i say that because wallow Range Rover

10:57.630 --> 11:04.021
does not have the best reputation and explore
a little. They ran into a few problems,

11:04.022 --> 11:11.889
such as painting, interior, problems with the engine.
-version Of 4 liters. -I 4.6.

11:11.890 --> 11:18.926
And the diesel versions. All engines. Gearboxes are corrupt.
-Miniature. And handheld.

11:18.927 --> 11:26.386
Gear, suspension as well. And all the electronics.
-Yes. -All. -Yes.

11:26.387 --> 11:33.888
I had a conversation with Land Rover about
it and they said that this is made good.

11:33.889 --> 11:40.295
So I said, "Well, give us one to six months."
And they agreed.

11:40.296 --> 11:45.320
If any waste,
or is dissolved or broken down, in any way,

11:45.321 --> 11:50.725
We can not kill the director's dog. That's fair.
-Before His children.

11:50.726 --> 11:59.689
That sounds fair.
-On Example, if this is loosened just a little, the dog is finished.

12:00.861 --> 12:06.564
It is time to look back on 2002
and declare our car of the year.

12:06.565 --> 12:12.866
The nominees are: Range Rover that
we've just seen, the king of SUVs.

12:13.593 --> 12:20.129
Mazda 6, the Japanese answer to the
Germans who succeed, a great car for that.

12:20.510 --> 12:24.606
There is also a Mini Cooper S, the most
popular car in the world at the moment,

12:24.607 --> 12:28.437
as well as to drive the turbo-filled Parker.

12:28.828 --> 12:35.595
And Audi RS6, fast on the line,
quick cornering, fast, even in the rain.

12:36.024 --> 12:42.692
Are we missing something? Has anyone any suggestions?
-Majbah 62nd

12:42.693 --> 12:47.212
Maybach 62 is stupid car,
we can discuss that later. Anyone else?

12:47.213 --> 12:51.402
Voksal Vektra!
-Voksal Vektra?

12:51.403 --> 12:57.054
Vektra was not even the best
car that was launched in 1904!

12:58.320 --> 13:04.640
Jaguar XJ? He was released this year, is it?
Where do you live?

13:04.641 --> 13:12.764
In what part of the country? Coventry?
They make it there! Did you notice?

13:12.765 --> 13:20.320
I'm afraid that you are all astray, and the
official jury of the European elections,

13:20.321 --> 13:27.534
who voted for the auto Reno Megan year.
Only if you like watching.

13:27.535 --> 13:34.419
So, our car of the year is ...
We have a gold envelope. Ready?

13:34.420 --> 13:42.300
This is the Range Rover. Judges, and that
we are, we are very impressed chassis,

13:42.301 --> 13:47.573
heating and general "rendz-Roverošću".

13:47.574 --> 13:54.242
And the next one is the most pointless car.
The nominees are: Mercedes Maybach,

13:54.243 --> 13:57.357
because the private plane that can not fly.

13:57.358 --> 14:03.893
And Ford Fusion, which is advertising,
Ford Fiesta in the Hat.

14:06.189 --> 14:11.619
Rover 75, with a larger wheelbase,
suitable only for mayor of Preston.

14:13.155 --> 14:19.335
Are we forgetting something?
SL 55 AMG is besm ...

14:27.633 --> 14:33.421
To declare a winner, and that is:

14:33.422 --> 14:37.751
Ford Fusion!

14:41.995 --> 14:46.380
The jury was impressed by Ford's
lack of interest in this car,

14:46.381 --> 14:51.322
they knew all love male vans,
they knew they had to make him

14:51.323 --> 14:58.736
and they are not interested.
-Sledite Popular category for the strangest Reno.

14:59.630 --> 15:07.056
The nominees are: Velsatis, business auto,
but only if you work at Enron.

15:10.130 --> 15:15.980
Megan, family car,
but only if your family Osborne.

15:15.981 --> 15:22.644
I Avantajm, sports coupe, but only if
you want a car that does not look sporty,

15:23.173 --> 15:29.944
or as a coupe.
-Pobednik Found in the strangest Reno,

15:29.945 --> 15:35.438
Renault's crazy in the right manner:
Nisan Mikra!

15:36.501 --> 15:41.211
The jury noted that the designer
obviously had too much ink in the pen.

15:41.212 --> 15:47.167
See it! Finish design, man!
Step away from the table! You're done!

15:47.168 --> 15:50.555
That's enough detail in one car.

15:50.556 --> 15:55.378
Track important category,
our "Guarantor do not miss the money" awards.

15:55.379 --> 15:57.703
And the winner is:

15:57.704 --> 16:02.489
Eddie Irvine!
For advertising this pressure washer!

16:06.039 --> 16:10.628
He earned 6 million pounds last year,

16:10.629 --> 16:15.184
but still thought it was a good
idea to appear in this box.

16:15.439 --> 16:20.023
You have the mall to 79.99 pounds.

16:20.024 --> 16:24.339
At this point we will not award a
prize for the fastest car on our track,

16:24.340 --> 16:28.784
and it is a radical, with a staggering 1:19.

16:28.785 --> 16:35.468
It seems that the Germans oversee
our broadcast and came into contact

16:35.469 --> 16:41.904
and say they have several cars
that they think can win our path.

16:42.473 --> 16:48.893
This is AS 1, driven by the engine of a
motorcycle, also from Suzuki Hajabuze,

16:48.894 --> 16:54.405
we see the radical in Westfield.

16:54.406 --> 16:58.556
Wherein? It's gone.

16:59.555 --> 17:05.760
Wherever it is, it increased to 1.4 liters.
This does not sound like much,

17:05.761 --> 17:12.932
or AS 1 weighs only 600 kg.
This is the same as my shoes.

17:12.933 --> 17:19.039
So should not that fast as lightning.
But I'm more interested in this.

17:19.040 --> 17:25.987
It looks like a normal Audi TT with
stickers and a normal Audi engine.

17:26.569 --> 17:35.007
1.8 liters with turbocharging,
it is adjusted and now develops 400 hp.

17:35.580 --> 17:42.840
Just as a Ferrari 360.
In normal TT-in motor drives all four wheels.

17:42.841 --> 17:46.440
But in this,
the engine drives the front wheels.

17:46.441 --> 17:54.977
Recent launches something out of the trunk.
Another engine of 400 hp!

17:54.978 --> 18:01.972
There are two engines! 800 hp!
Obviously I have to try it!

18:05.924 --> 18:08.554
This hurts!

18:09.198 --> 18:12.477
Let's see how turns.

18:12.941 --> 18:17.710
It is best to close their eyes in a curve.
That's my advice.

18:17.986 --> 18:21.529
Two engines, ridiculous.

18:22.008 --> 18:28.685
Dual fuel bill, but it must be
said that it is double the fun.

18:29.900 --> 18:37.870
Wonderful! But these cars must now go
through a difficult test. Stiga Salute!

18:38.325 --> 18:44.098
AS 1 moves first,
but no stereo is Stig bad mood.

18:44.099 --> 18:48.367
Maybe you do not act soon,
or at all do not get pregnant!

18:48.368 --> 18:52.035
You see how it is aligned
in the head with a hammer!

18:52.036 --> 18:57.285
Now passes near the tires, it is very fast!

18:57.320 --> 19:01.632
A little flame from the exhaust,
while coming in the last two curvatures!

19:01.633 --> 19:07.339
Malo struggled, but remains on track,
this is the last curvature in the order!

19:08.334 --> 19:14.125
The following is a strong TT with two engines,
which is fast on the line, but bad when cornering.

19:14.126 --> 19:18.343
Again, no stereo, Stig will be very angry!

19:18.344 --> 19:21.830
While entering the hammer head,
the lack of stereo affects driving.

19:22.223 --> 19:28.416
Large flames as it enters the last curve
and really deserved Christmas present.

19:29.036 --> 19:34.361
Congratulations, Germans bothered you.
Here's our table with the fastest times.

19:34.362 --> 19:40.645
At the top of the British Radikal
with a whopping 1:19. Very good car.

19:40.646 --> 19:48.167
Let's see how the Germans drove. First,
Bimoto with two engines is a smart choice.

19:48.168 --> 19:56.690
Time is 5: 1. No, that's not it, this is the result.
-The Score from 1945 -From in 1966.

19:56.691 --> 20:02.771
No, it is not.
In fact it is 1:28, which is very good.

20:02.772 --> 20:09.036
Faster than a Lamborghini's nine seconds
slower than the British Radicals.

20:09.071 --> 20:16.386
What was 1 AS?
-Another Good German car, an impressive 1:29.

20:16.387 --> 20:22.164
Oh my God.
-Odlican Success. -Oh my God. They're not as fast as the British Radikal,

20:22.165 --> 20:26.910
which remains the fastest car of the season with 1:19.
-Great News.

20:26.911 --> 20:33.830
A few weeks ago, we were looking
for the fastest British faith.

20:33.831 --> 20:39.222
Won the Church of England. The problem
is that the Muslims did not participate,

20:39.223 --> 20:44.661
because at the time the recording was Ramadan.
And for the same time, they are prohibited

20:44.662 --> 20:52.976
eat or engage in motorsport.
But to announce that Ramadan is over,

20:52.977 --> 20:59.130
but we Muslims here.
And not only him but also the druids!

20:59.131 --> 21:06.341
I Rastafarian and the Seventh-day Adventist!
Welcome!

21:09.035 --> 21:12.952
You're huge!

21:14.003 --> 21:19.855
What is your name?
-Pastor Gary Gordon. -Okay. Where you live? -In Oxford.

21:19.856 --> 21:27.675
What do you drive?
-Pežo 1.9 diesel. You got any idea what we're doing here?

21:27.676 --> 21:32.124
Yes, somewhat.
-You Will not take a lot of the Peugeot diesel train, that's for sure.

21:32.125 --> 21:38.150
And you are? I guess, Rastafarian.
-That's right. And what's your name?

21:38.151 --> 21:43.236
Levi. What do you drive?
-Mondea Diesel.

21:44.363 --> 21:49.840
Another diesel.
-Interesantan As Peugeot. -Did You deal motorsport?

21:49.841 --> 21:54.701
I participated in the opening of the
British Rally Championship. Really?

21:54.702 --> 22:00.290
Only in the initial Polo class.
-Whatever, It is participating in a real motorsport.

22:00.291 --> 22:04.349
With the left wheel.
You got it, all you have.

22:09.617 --> 22:16.400
And you what is your name?
-Arthur Pendragon. -King Arthur? -Just One.

22:16.435 --> 22:21.334
I thought he was a fictional character.
No, I did not, and neither is this sword.

22:22.042 --> 22:27.239
Finally, in the end, is that you?
-Tarik DASIM. -Where you live?

22:27.240 --> 22:33.551
In West Sussex. What do you drive?
-Škodu RS. -Fast Car!

22:33.552 --> 22:38.331
I've got a little note that
he once drove to Paris,

22:38.332 --> 22:40.462
or you misread the speed limit. I did.

22:40.463 --> 22:47.499
You thought that the limit of 130 km / h,
the limit of 130 miles.

22:47.684 --> 22:52.104
Perfect. Now we'll find out what you
have been on the track this morning,

22:52.105 --> 22:55.507
obviously save a car in one piece,
which can not be said for the bishops,

22:55.508 --> 22:59.032
who was here a few weeks ago.
-I Do not believe the bishop. -That's right.

22:59.067 --> 23:02.867
And you stay away from the grass.

23:05.839 --> 23:09.087
We'll see what you've been a little later.

23:09.411 --> 23:13.299
Last Sunday we had some
amazing offers for you:

23:13.300 --> 23:18.953
Volkswagen Pasat 11,000 or Fiat
Stilo to 7,995, and best of all,

23:18.954 --> 23:25.789
Ford Ka to 4,995. There has never been
cheaper and easier to buy a new car.

23:25.790 --> 23:31.648
Such prices are killing polovnjak.
When something like this comes to sales,

23:31.649 --> 23:34.514
practically worshiped him.

23:38.857 --> 23:45.118
Here's the first car today, Citroen AX.
He crossed the 65,000 km less.

23:45.119 --> 23:50.291
Since seven years old,
I can buy it for 1,300 pounds.

23:50.292 --> 23:56.413
This is Citroen AX Ilejšen,
limited edition, has a one-liter engine,

23:56.414 --> 24:01.345
which means that a small registration,
and has a sunroof and metallic paint.

24:01.346 --> 24:06.904
When you look inside, you know it's nice.
Stereo, all the parts that should have,

24:06.905 --> 24:11.436
a driven only 63,000 km,
this car is only half of his century.

24:11.684 --> 24:17.977
A few years ago, such an AX has cost
2,000 pounds. So this is a gift.

24:18.400 --> 24:22.928
The following is a family car,
Nissan Primera for less than 1,000 pounds.

24:22.929 --> 24:28.120
You get power and electric
windows and even the factory roof.

24:28.121 --> 24:34.426
He crossed the 150,000 km,
but it will be good for at least 65,000 km.

24:35.574 --> 24:40.385
A not to invest in something that is punched.
A careful inspection of color

24:40.386 --> 24:44.013
shows no signs of repairs.

24:44.241 --> 24:49.258
Electric windows work fine,
but how it works sunroof?

24:49.259 --> 24:53.900
When zaverglate cold engine,
no crackling and banging.

24:56.457 --> 25:00.442
All this for a grand,
seems to me like a great offer.

25:03.329 --> 25:07.059
But since it's the cheapest auto correct?

25:07.060 --> 25:11.126
This man, Martin Gordon,
does not waste £ 200 per car.

25:11.127 --> 25:15.523
This, Nisan 300C, it cost him 100 pounds.

25:15.574 --> 25:22.783
He crossed the 215,000 km,
but so far had no major failures.

25:24.208 --> 25:31.221
With this car you need a strong battery,
good cables and spark plugs,

25:31.222 --> 25:36.346
because the problems with electricity
were highest in low-cost car.

25:36.347 --> 25:40.614
It turned out that the easiest
cars are easy to maintain.

25:40.615 --> 25:47.008
You're obviously committed to this.
I think it's funny to put a lot of money

25:47.009 --> 25:52.631
and watch how rapidly losing value.
I know it is an impressive car,

25:52.632 --> 25:57.079
but with a little attention can be as
reliable as auto 10-12 years younger.

25:58.408 --> 26:03.828
If someone hits you, steal,
or has a major fault, I'll get another.

26:04.683 --> 26:08.875
You must be familiar with if you
are buying a car for 100 pounds.

26:08.876 --> 26:11.918
For a little more money,
you can still take a decent car.

26:12.551 --> 26:18.088
This Voksal Astra CDI have power steering,
electric mirrors shift,

26:18.553 --> 26:25.435
even has a factory sunroof. Look at this,
440 pounds and it is the dealer.

26:25.470 --> 26:28.927
If you are brave and go for auction,
you can go cheaper.

26:28.928 --> 26:33.281
This is not the old nag. Covering
approximately 150,000 km and service history,

26:33.282 --> 26:36.313
there are still plenty of life ahead of him.

26:36.314 --> 26:41.738
One of the reasons why these
cars are so cheap "time bombs".

26:41.739 --> 26:47.099
Under this belief that if something breaks down,
it will cost more than the value of the car.

26:48.141 --> 26:52.771
Modern cars have computers,
and if you break down, it's over.

26:52.772 --> 26:55.700
Better to put the trash.

26:56.542 --> 27:00.036
Some experts would say to avoid these
"time bombs"

27:00.037 --> 27:05.561
but consider carefully select and
take this car for a year or two,

27:05.562 --> 27:11.726
This is a cheap ride.
If it breaks, do not howl, take another.

27:11.727 --> 27:16.959
But, Jason, this Astra is creepy.
-Skin 440 pounds. -The truth.

27:16.960 --> 27:22.438
I found a 14-year-old Volvo. He crossed
the 250,000 km, I paid him 900 pounds.

27:22.439 --> 27:26.866
Now I registered for the second time.
When rikne also sign it.

27:26.867 --> 27:32.045
What if the wrong one of these cars?
-I do not care. 440 pounds for the Astra,

27:32.046 --> 27:35.619
a much does it cost to service new car.
-The truth.

27:36.131 --> 27:42.916
You can spend Christmas without the Astra, but you
can not without a bit of Bond, but there it is.

27:48.914 --> 27:51.622
Did you ever had the feeling
that somebody loves you?

28:13.854 --> 28:20.138
Did you see that?
-Who is? That's where the fish. How is this fish got into the car,

28:20.139 --> 28:24.887
and that Barbara Beck and Roger Moore are not drowned?
-Good question.

28:24.888 --> 28:30.486
I notice these things in the movies.
The hole is big enough that the fish inside.

28:30.487 --> 28:36.335
And a lot of water. The point is that we
have shown the insert because we wanted

28:36.336 --> 28:43.692
to show how old Lotus Esprit. 27 years!
A quarter of the history of the car!

28:43.693 --> 28:49.219
And if you think about it,
was launched when these ties were in fashion.

28:49.220 --> 28:56.012
I was wondering what you will.
-Nadživeo These and those from the '70s,

28:56.013 --> 29:01.004
outlived Vrekles Erika,
Elvis Costello is still topical

29:01.005 --> 29:05.373
at the time the present of Windsor knot.
That's interesting comparison. It's perfect!

29:05.408 --> 29:12.571
And I can not remember anything from
1975 that looks half as good as this.

29:29.124 --> 29:35.198
The only thing that follows
Esprit from 1975 to today's price.

29:35.199 --> 29:43.134
With 50,000 pounds costs half as the
Ferrari 360. But he did not half a car.

29:44.188 --> 29:49.093
He stayed in the game
because of a constant rate.

29:49.671 --> 29:54.216
Today, instead of the 2.2-liter
engine četvorocilindrinčnog

29:54.217 --> 29:58.250
has a 3.5-liter V8 with
a pair of turbochargers.

29:58.251 --> 30:02.578
Perhaps the classic,
but still wears bracelets with spikes

30:02.579 --> 30:06.243
and thrashing his head as a young man.

30:06.244 --> 30:11.773
A does not work either as your father
while dancing. He's pretty good.

30:26.548 --> 30:34.291
Esprit makes 266 hp per tonne,
which is more than the Mercedes SL 55

30:34.292 --> 30:39.845
or a Porsche 911 or a Ferrari 456.
He's like North Korea.

30:39.846 --> 30:42.947
Small but dangerous.

30:42.948 --> 30:47.981
This means that going from
0-100 km / h in 4.8 seconds.

30:47.982 --> 30:55.451
Maximum speed is 280 km / h. It
is still very, very fast car.

30:57.235 --> 31:03.763
And not just on the line.
The cornering is absolutely perfect.

31:03.764 --> 31:08.144
Gives a hint of understeer that
you know you're on the edge, and if

31:08.145 --> 31:13.145
continue to tread, you will get a large dose
of adrenaline while slipping on the side.

31:14.189 --> 31:18.524
Beautifully balanced.

31:24.122 --> 31:27.985
One area where I can not hide age is here.

31:27.986 --> 31:31.751
Do not forget that this car from the
time when people lived in the trees.

31:31.752 --> 31:36.036
Only learned to walk upright so
it was cramped driving position.

31:36.037 --> 31:40.444
Over the years,
they tried to improve with a new dashboards

31:40.445 --> 31:45.847
and other seats, but it's like moving
furniture in a small apartment.

31:46.566 --> 31:49.400
It will still be a small apartment.

31:56.569 --> 32:02.037
Lack of space is nothing against
the real Achilles heel of this car:

32:02.038 --> 32:04.919
its transmission.

32:05.610 --> 32:11.013
Changing gears in this car should be
like a freshly bathed pats the dog,

32:11.014 --> 32:18.535
but in the present is like a gift to the
crocodile, coarse and rough and yuck!

32:18.536 --> 32:20.773
He's hopeless!

32:21.030 --> 32:24.105
Almost ruining a whole car.

32:24.106 --> 32:28.037
Almost, but not quite.

32:28.038 --> 32:36.095
The fact is that I am an admirer of Esprit, I
have always been and will always be waiting.

32:40.677 --> 32:45.473
So, you like Esprit. But how much longer?
That's a big problem,

32:45.474 --> 32:50.249
because the transmission, the thing that
spoils it, it will probably kill you.

32:50.250 --> 32:55.182
Because it was taken from the Renault 25,
a Reno not true for years.

32:55.183 --> 33:00.082
And running out of them. And the problem is
that they can not make their own transmissions

33:00.083 --> 33:05.404
because of how much they sell a year? Half of the
car. That's right, it would cost millions of pounds.

33:05.405 --> 33:10.730
And if you kill it, it's a shame,
because whoever you ask here

33:10.731 --> 33:16.436
to draft a supercar, it'll draw.
Yes, it has a perfect shape supercar.

33:16.437 --> 33:21.051
Do you know why? Because it has headlights
that can be lifted. Yes, I love them!

33:21.052 --> 33:25.536
When I was a kid all I wanted was a
car with headlights that can be lifted.

33:25.537 --> 33:30.401
Do you know how many cars now have
these headlights? This and another.

33:30.402 --> 33:37.570
Do you know what? RX7?
RX7's not true anymore. MX5 them no more.

33:38.243 --> 33:46.402
Porsche does not make them any more. What?
Ferrari 456! It hit the man from Coventry!

33:47.388 --> 33:52.792
Bravo Ferrari 456 is still the only one left.
I think we need more to make them.

33:52.793 --> 34:00.104
Why is it not true? They say that affect the
aerodynamics. So no need to chase the night.

34:00.105 --> 34:05.607
That's right! Replace them. However, there
is one thing we want to do with this car,

34:06.021 --> 34:07.849
Stiga leave!

34:07.850 --> 34:14.571
When we say that Stig transit Esprit
said it does not like the Lotus.

34:14.572 --> 34:18.119
I asked him why,
but he would continue to talk.

34:18.120 --> 34:23.141
The only way to get him in the car
was to buy him a CD of Mudi frock.

34:29.868 --> 34:36.676
Esprit is not only fast on the routes,
but it is good and when cornering.

34:36.677 --> 34:41.174
Look at this! The only thing bad brakes.

34:42.451 --> 34:45.224
Not that it needs.

34:50.199 --> 34:53.989
You see, the first time in six
weeks that the track is dry.

34:53.989 --> 35:00.118
Get in the last curve,
beautiful passes and passes the target!

35:00.558 --> 35:02.981
The weather is ... Ready?
-Yes.

35:02.982 --> 35:10.271
1:32 PM.
-32? That's faster than my car. That's a very good time.

35:10.272 --> 35:14.502
It's faster than many serious car.
Ide here. She was dry runs,

35:14.503 --> 35:20.627
but it is -254 degrees Celsius,
so that it was slippery.

35:20.628 --> 35:25.376
This is an amazing time.

35:25.377 --> 35:29.333
Aston, Ferrari, all are slower.
-I know! Bless you!

35:29.334 --> 35:36.008
When you cease to be true,
we will be very, very sad.

35:58.719 --> 36:03.335
And now the news:
this week we wanted to see what comes next.

36:03.336 --> 36:08.579
I Esprit, comes a lot of exciting supercar.
That's an understatement.

36:08.580 --> 36:12.081
It comes half a million new.
-Best Supercar next year

36:12.082 --> 36:19.379
must be this: Porsche Carrera GT.
It has a V10 engine, 250,000 pounds;

36:19.380 --> 36:23.487
or just look at it!
-It is beautiful.

36:23.488 --> 36:30.645
This is the most beautiful car I've
seen in a very, very long time.

36:30.646 --> 36:34.543
A new Viper, which is the American
equivalent of a sports car,

36:34.544 --> 36:39.729
as it is equivalent to President George W. Bush.
-Yes. That's it.

36:39.730 --> 36:46.017
8.3-liter engine, 500 hp is not enough,
because here comes a new Bugati

36:46.052 --> 36:54.973
which has a 1,000 hp! It's called the Veyron,
there ... How to put 1,000 hp in a car?

36:54.974 --> 37:00.809
Open the glove box, there is a 40 hp.
36 in the ashtray,

37:00.810 --> 37:06.449
slightly under the seat.
Look at him! 1,000 hp!

37:06.450 --> 37:10.561
An incredible amount of power.
-From 0 to the grave for four seconds.

37:10.596 --> 37:14.391
Poof! I'm dead!
-Ubrzaš Right into a tree!

37:14.392 --> 37:19.747
A little more realistic is the McLaren
Mercedes SLR. Just a little more realistic.

37:19.748 --> 37:24.792
It looks a bit like SL,
in fact very like SL from some angles,

37:24.793 --> 37:29.032
but it is a completely new car,
mainly carbon fiber, so it will be easy,

37:29.033 --> 37:35.693
has filled turbo V8 engine,
very fast. I can be yours for 250,000 pounds.

37:35.694 --> 37:43.368
Konigzeg!
You liked the SLR, but this is stronger.

37:43.369 --> 37:48.684
This one has 655 hp and think it
is the fastest car in the world.

37:48.685 --> 37:52.182
0-100 km / h in 3.5 seconds,
385 km / h top speed.

37:52.183 --> 37:58.266
385? I was Swedish?
-Yes. He will not guess it probavati in Sweden?

37:58.267 --> 38:04.324
It's slippery.
-Can Here to experiment on the road M1. Or M14. -M50 Not bad.

38:04.325 --> 38:09.382
M32 is good.
-M27. Does anyone have any other ideas?

38:09.383 --> 38:15.538
M5? Do not go in there ... Do not be stupid!
You can not drive 385 km / h on M5.

38:15.539 --> 38:21.806
Ridiculous! What follows next?
I know! Askari!

38:21.807 --> 38:27.590
Another supercar here in the studio!
This is the first and genuine in

38:27.591 --> 38:30.221
Banbury, from a company called Askari,
which is short for

38:30.222 --> 38:35.657
English-Scottish car industry.
BANBURY the English-Scottish and here it is.

38:35.658 --> 38:42.095
It has a 5-liter V8 engine.
They said they do not say where he was.

38:42.096 --> 38:45.438
It's a secret.

38:45.439 --> 38:51.518
BMW X5 we had before in the studio.
Good engine has. Yeah, good.

38:53.902 --> 38:58.582
What can we say about him? The problem
is that many British companies appear

38:58.617 --> 39:06.497
who wanted to build a supercar:
Li-Francis, Jensen, Markos,

39:06.597 --> 39:11.741
Stratkaren i ... Everyone failed. All of!

39:11.742 --> 39:15.914
We wish all the best Askari from Britain!
Not! Not the best of Britain!

39:15.949 --> 39:19.278
We wish good luck. Fingers rod.

39:19.313 --> 39:23.410
If you want, you can not buy some
of these many supercar coming,

39:23.411 --> 39:30.014
do not worry, there is lots and sports cars.
Chrysler throws 26,000 pounds

39:30.015 --> 39:37.804
Krosfajer worth. Here it is.
Basically, it's a Mercedes SLK.

39:37.805 --> 39:44.448
It was designed by Briton and is made in
Germany, the car for the pride of America!

39:45.090 --> 39:50.547
A coming and a new Mazda RX8.
22,400 pounds, a very good price.

39:50.548 --> 39:53.812
Wankel engine, rear doors open to a counter.

39:53.847 --> 40:01.104
These engines Vanke had a big problem,
because the piston too quickly spent.

40:01.105 --> 40:07.312
I think it will zam ... Really it.
Using the hardest thing known to man.

40:07.313 --> 40:13.056
Diamonds?
-Tvrđu Of the diamond. I'll tell you what's hardest substances,

40:13.091 --> 40:20.176
this is the "Bonžita". Listen to this:
Bonžita left in the bowl and put

40:20.177 --> 40:25.673
the dishwasher.
Have you ever tried to take off?

40:26.870 --> 40:31.679
I had to put 60 tons of dynamite into a bowl,
blew a bowl,

40:31.680 --> 40:35.380
but she still clung to pieces.
That is the solution, no doubt.

40:35.415 --> 40:40.348
It's now used to the Mazda Bonžita.
Coming up there some sensible cars?

40:40.349 --> 40:45.956
I have a list of the new
car and the answer was no.

40:46.684 --> 40:53.706
Porsche says an SUV worth 50,000 pounds
that goes 240 km / h. It is not reasonable.

40:53.707 --> 40:59.964
Volkswagen, whose name means "people's car",
says Feton than 60,000 pounds.

40:59.965 --> 41:04.859
Reasonable!
-Ekonomija In Germany clearly doing better than we think.

41:04.860 --> 41:10.981
There is one, in fact, has a reasonable car.
Voksal Signum.

41:10.982 --> 41:14.022
Basically the Vectra.

41:17.112 --> 41:22.638
Coming down. We have to forget about his
"vektrinoću" because it is not

41:22.639 --> 41:26.876
like the Zafira, Astra, which is a
seven-seater. There are only five seats,

41:26.877 --> 41:33.508
but the seats are moved back and recline.
They are very good back.

41:33.509 --> 41:37.856
It will be the first car that
people will scramble to sit back.

41:37.857 --> 41:45.022
"No, no, you go!
Really, you drive, I'll sit here."

41:45.445 --> 41:53.494
This was the end of the news. No, not
because TVR has a new car every three weeks.

41:53.495 --> 41:59.735
I all have substantially the same. This is
without looking T350C know what I'll get.

41:59.736 --> 42:06.881
Very sexy curved body,
great sound engine and two seats.

42:06.882 --> 42:13.192
And there it is. The point is that this
car mostly taken lovers "race days"

42:13.193 --> 42:18.768
people who go to the race track on Saturday,
Monday and transport parts.

42:18.769 --> 42:24.229
Must be "Jekyll and Hyde" car,
which is not easy.

42:32.699 --> 42:38.335
The new car uses the proven TVR's engine,
which provides 350 hp

42:38.336 --> 42:43.052
and 0-100 km / h in 4.4 seconds.

42:43.053 --> 42:47.774
There are tough rather soft top and this
makes it tougher. But these curves are

42:47.775 --> 42:51.261
designed to be aerodynamic as a
top priority in the development.

42:51.262 --> 42:56.287
All this is good news for road and racetrack.

42:57.270 --> 43:01.823
But it gets tricky when it comes to
adjusting the suspension, chassis,

43:01.858 --> 43:07.456
shock absorbers, springs, these things.
You must know the set.

43:08.249 --> 43:12.687
This is a race track, covered with
fine asphalt, so you can adjust the

43:12.688 --> 43:16.599
suspension to be hard as you like,
you can make a quick lap.

43:18.210 --> 43:24.181
But this is a British car,
what you use every day, full of patches,

43:24.182 --> 43:28.919
with holes and damages with trenches next.

43:30.279 --> 43:37.012
TVR brought the car and mechanics, we have
added Stiga and adjusted according to him.

43:42.794 --> 43:46.489
The car did not even flinch at the start.

43:49.531 --> 43:56.239
A see how it goes through the curve,
there are no drift. A very fast.

43:56.240 --> 44:00.047
A and scored a good time 1:28.

44:00.048 --> 44:04.285
Over time, adjust the auto sharper,
more fierce, according Stigovom taste,

44:04.897 --> 44:07.462
to the very limits.

44:25.781 --> 44:29.533
And it gets worse when you
leave the track and go home.

44:30.388 --> 44:36.259
I think Stig need to keep
driving rather than mechanics.

44:36.260 --> 44:41.723
This is total rubbish on the road!

44:41.724 --> 44:47.384
So uncomfortable! I can not manage!

44:47.385 --> 44:52.895
I do not know where to turn now, go randomly.

44:54.618 --> 44:59.200
He was returned to the garage
and Stig was said to be realistic

44:59.201 --> 45:03.703
and to help TVR in to adjust
the car that everyone can use.

45:11.590 --> 45:15.926
Then he returned to the track
with a little softer setting.

45:19.727 --> 45:24.693
I immediately see that there
is more skidding in curves,

45:24.694 --> 45:30.816
a time within the second, slower,
1:29, but it was still a good time.

45:30.817 --> 45:33.653
And it is much better to drive.

45:35.192 --> 45:41.864
On the road is much better to
ride and faster in the real world.

45:42.645 --> 45:48.489
Some TVR finish the job, but at least
now they know where the boundaries.

45:53.420 --> 45:58.352
One thing I want to do with this car,
to think up a better name.

45:58.353 --> 46:03.858
T350C sounds like iron.
-Štagod That is, a jack. He's a tool.

46:03.859 --> 46:09.011
And that will not go, so whatever you come up
with, even if they continue to call it T350C,

46:09.012 --> 46:13.406
we will call it will.
Choosing a name can be tricky.

46:13.407 --> 46:19.840
I have here a list of names and
better the original, I swear.

46:19.841 --> 46:24.693
It was the Mazda Bongo friends. Very chic!

46:24.893 --> 46:30.235
Mitsubishi Mini Active Urban Sandal.

46:30.236 --> 46:34.274
What's its mark? This one is the best:

46:34.275 --> 46:40.960
Isuzu Mysterious Useful Wizard. Great name!

46:40.961 --> 46:44.876
I do not work only Japanese,
'80 Volkswagen has launched

46:44.877 --> 46:50.889
1 version of the Golf, convertible
pink with white skin and was called:

46:50.890 --> 46:59.301
Fancy boy. We did not see them in the UK.
-Importers Said: "No, thank you."

46:59.302 --> 47:06.781
TVR soon had a great name.
They had serber, as a dog (Cerberus).

47:06.816 --> 47:12.675
They had the Chimera, a mythological creature
and TUŠKAN, which is the supreme god of all,

47:12.676 --> 47:20.067
and now come up with a microwave. They will have
to do better than that. I've got a great idea:

47:20.774 --> 47:26.002
Ready? "Black Widow"
You can not call it that car, that's awful.

47:26.003 --> 47:30.976
I just did, that's TVR Black Widow,
a fighter plane called so.

47:30.977 --> 47:36.293
The pilot was flying, was killed and another
took his place, all they want that plane.

47:36.294 --> 47:42.371
I know what you want,
a powerful name like TVR Armageddon.

47:42.372 --> 47:50.920
Is there a proposal? Poseidon? What is a god?
-Must. -Must?

47:50.921 --> 47:57.974
Discarded.
-There's Someone else? -Tor! -Tor? -God Thunder. Yes, TVR Tor.

47:58.385 --> 48:01.443
Harry Potter!

48:02.547 --> 48:07.134
Very, very poor! It's a wizard!
I know that is a wizard,

48:07.135 --> 48:10.760
just like TVR Harry Potter.

48:10.761 --> 48:14.496
There's something about it,
such as the famous TVR's lineup.

48:14.497 --> 48:19.640
TVR Beatrix Potter.
Zeka Piter, we like this forever.

48:19.641 --> 48:23.421
I think you're missing the point Masi.
That's Paddington Bear.

48:23.565 --> 48:30.942
Perfect!
-If You can not call it Black Widow, what do you think of Valhalla?

48:31.983 --> 48:35.951
Yes. What do you mean "yes"?
Just decision, end of discussion.

48:35.952 --> 48:39.882
Again, as with the cool wall!
She decided that we will make a great name,

48:39.883 --> 48:43.759
but this is, no matter how it was called TVR,
Valhalla! End of story!

48:43.760 --> 48:49.278
Vikings go there when they die, are not you?
-Groblje For the Vikings. Perfect.

48:49.279 --> 48:52.612
We agreed!

48:52.613 --> 48:57.399
What a relief.
Now is the time to return the fastest vera.

48:57.400 --> 49:02.355
We'll find out whether any of these people,
faster than the Church of England.

49:04.016 --> 49:11.833
Like the previous contestants,
will take Subaru 350 hp.

49:13.281 --> 49:18.666
Will the Church of England
to remain ruler of the track?

49:18.667 --> 49:22.093
The first goes Tarik, a Muslim.

49:37.565 --> 49:45.685
Tariq was going great, but the druid
invoked the ancient gods oversteer.

49:54.624 --> 49:58.567
Avoid the obstacles.
Give bonus points for turning?

49:59.115 --> 50:02.720
Tariq Ali has mastered makes
and completed the circuit.

50:07.193 --> 50:10.132
A lot of squeaking tires.

50:11.010 --> 50:18.408
There is a point of braking and going the
long route. There's no markers for this.

50:20.161 --> 50:24.956
Next Arthur Pendragon,
a member of an ancient Druid order,

50:24.957 --> 50:29.604
Merlin priest, a war leader,
the high priest Dragon cave

50:30.305 --> 50:32.793
and the driver Morris Oxford.

50:34.963 --> 50:41.587
My Peugeot 1.9 D does not sound like that.
0-100 km / h for 10 minutes!

50:44.471 --> 50:48.516
Led by Celtic druid
spirits had a neat circle.

50:48.616 --> 50:52.458
As it passed so quickly? It's magic!

50:56.960 --> 51:00.621
Geri, Seventh-day Adventist, was next.

51:00.622 --> 51:06.941
But then he threw druid
makes and reduce auto.

51:19.977 --> 51:22.715
Some advice?

51:23.473 --> 51:28.643
You need to make this work together.
-I Like the idea of ​​the co-pilot.

51:32.219 --> 51:40.400
I am too, so to speak, masculine, thank you.
I'm too big for a car.

51:40.401 --> 51:45.368
The last Levi's, Rastafarian,
spawning spirit Jaya.

51:45.806 --> 51:51.535
Jah, strong, blessed ...
And druid lost his eye.

52:03.233 --> 52:07.694
And this was the right answer the current
champion of the Church of England,

52:07.695 --> 52:12.298
because, like him,
an amateur runner weekends.

52:12.727 --> 52:15.060
I saw it.

52:21.036 --> 52:27.567
All the superstars themselves and one
complete tragedy! Yes, the car was too small.

52:27.568 --> 52:32.474
I know the feeling, all the cars are too small, do not you?
-I Do not know the feeling.

52:33.216 --> 52:35.418
I met with the team.

52:35.742 --> 52:40.415
What am I talking about?
-To Hear the results. Let's hits the back as usual:

52:40.416 --> 52:45.136
fourth in you, Gary,
because you could not get in the car.

52:45.137 --> 52:48.276
Your time is now up to four hours.

52:48.962 --> 52:56.899
This is worrying.
-Third Place: King Arthur, with the time 1:48.

52:56.900 --> 53:01.841
In the second place: Tarik, with excellent weather, 1:41.
-Thank you.

53:01.842 --> 53:09.347
The big question is, because we know
now that the growth of Levi, won,

53:09.348 --> 53:14.155
but the big question is whether
you win Church of England.

53:14.156 --> 53:18.976
When the last time vehicles,
the time was 1:37, faster than all of you.

53:18.977 --> 53:24.202
You're driven to 1:31!

53:33.525 --> 53:38.403
It was only two seconds slower
than the record Stigovog!

53:38.404 --> 53:44.659
An amazing ride,
Jason bring the trophy for the fastest faith!

53:53.774 --> 53:58.961
In fact, it is the fastest vera for now,
until we find a small Adventist,

53:59.830 --> 54:02.215
or a bigger car.

54:02.216 --> 54:06.221
Every week we put a star
in a reasonably priced car.

54:06.222 --> 54:11.077
We did a complete season.
And the effect is varied.

54:11.078 --> 54:15.759
Ladies and gentlemen, Harry Enfield!
Ready to try. 3-4 now!

54:18.096 --> 54:20.405
I'm running 50 km / h!

54:22.084 --> 54:26.945
I'm out of control.
-Vođa Jamiroquai, Jay Kay!

54:27.954 --> 54:32.005
Do not screw up, do not come on too much gas!

54:32.006 --> 54:34.283
It is beautiful!

54:43.957 --> 54:45.675
Ross Kemp!

54:50.762 --> 54:55.730
Rubble! I hate you.
I'll tell you this sooner or later.

54:55.731 --> 54:59.961
Jonathan Ross!
You see this wonderful diversion.

54:59.962 --> 55:01.900
Not so much.

55:02.555 --> 55:05.420
You look ridiculous!

55:10.204 --> 55:12.345
I look like a fan of Star Trek!

55:17.398 --> 55:21.192
You're lucky I'm still alive!
You think I care ?!

55:21.193 --> 55:25.186
Not! But you're in luck!
Who wants to see his practicing?

55:28.089 --> 55:30.742
I thought it would be faster.

55:31.758 --> 55:35.023
Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Coogan!

55:35.024 --> 55:41.380
I'm glad I cleaned my teeth.
-Toneš The growing panic easily.

55:41.862 --> 55:44.140
This was in order.

55:45.064 --> 55:51.182
I drive a Lexus.
-1: 53, Ross Kemp will go mad. -Pobedio'm Ross Kemp!

55:51.183 --> 55:56.513
Tara Palmer Tomkinson! I'm going to
Harvey Nichols, which soon closed.

55:58.533 --> 56:02.913
Handsome man on the street, wave it!
This left.

56:05.355 --> 56:11.405
Do not bump into, but when I park,
isčukam city itself.

56:11.406 --> 56:14.244
From the group Status Quo, Rick Parfit!

56:17.421 --> 56:19.630
It's beautiful and there's more!

56:21.241 --> 56:24.213
Back on track.

56:27.425 --> 56:32.319
You crossed the goal side!
Ladies and gentlemen, Sir Michael Gambon!

56:34.151 --> 56:37.741
You look so frightened.

56:38.153 --> 56:40.111
Tires!

56:40.775 --> 56:44.205
You passed very close to the tires.
Well I should have.

56:55.811 --> 57:00.294
Gordon Ramsay! Damn,
I could have sworn I saw a traffic policeman.

57:01.398 --> 57:04.729
It tastes like gasoline!

57:04.877 --> 57:09.552
This is roasted on the Subaru Forester,
four cylinders in line, a good base!

57:18.219 --> 57:23.002
It was a mix of precision and Harry Anfield.

57:23.003 --> 57:27.949
But now it's time to assign the prize
for the fastest star in the season,

57:27.950 --> 57:34.404
but if you look at the table,
it's Jay Kay with 1:48 on here!

57:41.215 --> 57:43.744
And that is that.

57:45.607 --> 57:50.915
I'm sorry you fell off the end.
-BBC Are not dropped a bundle.

57:50.916 --> 57:55.775
Do you want to give a speech in the style
of Tom Hanks when it receives the prize?

57:56.237 --> 58:02.739
I want to tell everyone that this is one
of the most beautiful days of my life,

58:02.839 --> 58:06.949
I got this prize and no Brit
Award or EMI is nowhere near this

58:06.950 --> 58:13.188
i want to thank Jeremy, BBC, God, Mom, thank you.
-Fantastic!

58:18.177 --> 58:21.044
Mass, Stig, Mass!
