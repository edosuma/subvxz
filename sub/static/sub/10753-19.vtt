WEBVTT

00:07.674 --> 00:11.269
I would like to depart
from my usual format

00:11.594 --> 00:13.630
because I read a book that...

00:13.888 --> 00:17.324
It truly just knocked
my mental socks off.

00:17.642 --> 00:19.951
It's called "The Menopausal Male".

00:20.228 --> 00:23.618
Its author, the psychiatric scholar
Dr Helmut Bruga,

00:23.940 --> 00:28.297
has agreed to join us today from
the University of Washington.

00:28.653 --> 00:34.603
Dr Bruga, <i>guten Tag.</i> I've been an
admirer of yours for a long time.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.549
(Dr Bruga) 'l enjoy your show as well.'

00:37.829 --> 00:38.818
Really?

00:39.039 --> 00:43.032
'Yes. Though I do not in most cases
agree with your analysis.'

00:43.376 --> 00:45.332
Back to your book.

00:46.379 --> 00:51.089
We're familiar with the changes that
occur in the female menopause, but...

00:51.468 --> 00:55.746
'Excuse me, Dr Crane.
May I say hello to Roz?'

00:57.140 --> 00:58.414
Yes, of course.

00:58.641 --> 01:02.429
- 'Hello, Roz.'
- Hello, Dr Bruga.

01:02.771 --> 01:07.481
Your research indicates that
the reproductive imperative

01:07.859 --> 01:09.895
is reawakened
in later life when a man is...

01:10.153 --> 01:13.031
'You have a very sensuous voice.'

01:15.575 --> 01:17.247
Thank you.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.884
- 'Not you. Roz.'
- Yes, well, back to male menopause...

01:21.206 --> 01:24.835
'Would you like to go to a movie,
maybe grab a bite?'

01:25.168 --> 01:27.728
Well, that would be very...

01:28.004 --> 01:30.074
No, thank you very much.

01:30.340 --> 01:35.334
Thank you for joining us, Dr Bruga,
and for so vividly proving your point.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.793
- 'You will give Roz my number?'
- Oh, I think Roz has your number.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.326
(Doorbell)

01:50.026 --> 01:53.416
- Oh, hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne. Is this a bad time?

01:53.738 --> 01:56.775
Your brother isn't home,
your father's out walking Eddie.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.430
Oh, darn the luck.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.001
I stopped by to drop off
this necklace for Maris.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.200
I'll hide it here till her birthday.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.848
- I'm sure it will be fine. Mind if I peek?
- Not at all.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.525
Oh!

02:13.425 --> 02:17.862
My! Emeralds!
Your practice must be doing well.

02:18.221 --> 02:22.055
Who'd have thought the mentally
disturbed had this much money?

02:24.019 --> 02:28.695
- Would you like to try it on?
- Oh, yes! Wouldn't Mrs Crane mind?

02:29.065 --> 02:31.260
No. Maris is the soul of generosity.

02:31.526 --> 02:37.078
Just last week, she donated all her old
cocktail dresses to a homeless shelter.

02:39.784 --> 02:42.617
Oh, let me just
get my hair out of the way.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.664
Oh! Oh, my!

02:44.914 --> 02:47.303
- Can you see them?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.384 --> 03:00.502
Hello, Niles.
Whatever are you doing here?

03:00.847 --> 03:06.365
I bought an emerald necklace for Maris,
and I needed someplace to hide it.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.745
Emeralds? Well, may I see it?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.256
Not at the moment, no.

03:16.446 --> 03:20.075
- Why not?
- It's down me blouse.

03:20.408 --> 03:25.038
I see. Well, I'm sure Maris will
never think of looking for it there.

03:26.664 --> 03:31.055
It slipped down there
when I was trying it on. I'll go extract it.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.917
Just call me butterfingers.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.925
Join a health club, Niles.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.591
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Dad.

03:40.845 --> 03:44.758
- Niles, what brings you by?
- I'm hiding Maris' birthday gift.

03:45.100 --> 03:49.378
Oh, it's that time again.
I guess I'll have to get her something.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.448
Too bad.
I just got back from the hardware store.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.121
I saw a great ratchet set.

03:56.444 --> 04:00.517
As if there's anything left on her
that needs tightening.

04:07.539 --> 04:11.088
- Oh, Dad, no, not more duct tape!
- Yeah...

04:11.418 --> 04:16.173
I got to repair a little split
in the old throne here.

04:17.548 --> 04:21.462
Got to catch these rips early,
or they look like hell.

04:24.222 --> 04:28.534
- Why don't I bring the Eames here?
- Oh, no.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.646
I need a comfortable place
for my fanny.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.248
- (Whispers) How about Florida?
- I heard that.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.314
I put all this care
into decorating my home,

04:40.613 --> 04:43.286
only to have it mocked by this atrocity.

04:43.575 --> 04:47.011
It is your home. Why don't you
just make him get rid of it?

04:47.328 --> 04:50.764
It's not so simple. One would
have to find the right moment.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.994
One should consider Dad's feelings.

04:54.294 --> 04:58.128
- He is attached to this little chair.
- You're afraid to stand up to him!

04:58.465 --> 05:00.899
Oh, like you're not!

05:01.176 --> 05:04.486
At least I don't have to
live with something unattractive.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.535
I'm just having some fun with you.
I think Maris is rather attractive

05:15.899 --> 05:18.618
in a minimalist sort of way.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.894
Oh, forget it.
I'm just upset about the chair.

05:23.615 --> 05:28.291
There's a sound psychological basis
for getting rid of this chair.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.653
- Oh, really? Enlighten me, Doctor.
- With pleasure.

05:31.956 --> 05:36.552
Originally, Dad needed it to bridge
the transition from his old apartment.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.832
But, as with all transitional objects,
be they a teddy bear,

05:40.131 --> 05:42.884
be they a thumb, be they a blanky...

05:43.176 --> 05:45.929
Stop saying "be they"!

05:46.221 --> 05:49.054
The point is,
there comes a time when you must

05:49.349 --> 05:52.307
put these security objects aside
and reassert your independence.

05:52.602 --> 05:57.312
Yes, of course. So you're saying that
if I should go down to the store,

05:57.691 --> 06:02.287
buy Dad a new chair and throw
this one away, I'd be doing it for him?

06:02.654 --> 06:07.011
It would be a payback for when he used
your blanky to clean his revolver.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.462
Oops, I'm sorry. Our time is up.

06:31.474 --> 06:35.149
Dear God, Frasier, we've stumbled
upon hell's waiting room.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.398
This is not for the faint of heart.
We're treading a thin line here.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.853
We need something that complements
my decor and pleases Dad.

06:46.197 --> 06:51.510
Oh, dear God! How could anyone have
something like that in their living room?

06:51.911 --> 06:54.345
It looks like
it's upholstered in golf pants.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.817
Perhaps you could help us?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.039
- Perhaps.
- We need a chair.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.888
- We got 'em.
- Wait.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.005
We'd like one with
the presence of a Mies van der Rohe,

07:05.300 --> 07:07.860
and the insouciance of a Le Corbusier.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.889
This one vibrates.

07:11.181 --> 07:15.220
Perhaps you could direct us to
your recliners, preferably one in suede.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.791
People seem to like this Lazy Guy.

07:19.064 --> 07:24.297
What do they call the deluxe model:
the Hopeless Slackass?

07:28.740 --> 07:32.176
Oh, hey!
What about this one over here?

07:32.494 --> 07:35.725
That would not look
altogether hideous in my living room.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.234
Have a seat.
It's got Swedish massage.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.298
- No, thanks.
- No, no. Go ahead. Try it out.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.544
- I'll fire it up for you.
- That won't be necessary.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.512
I like to sit in my chair, not vibrate.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.395
Thank you any... Oh! Ooh!

07:51.888 --> 07:56.359
- It also has shiatsu.
- Ohh...

07:59.354 --> 08:02.187
I never knew a chair
could be this satisfying.

08:04.275 --> 08:08.393
I never knew anything could.
I want it!

08:08.738 --> 08:11.206
I'm sure it would fit in
with Maris' antiques?!

08:11.491 --> 08:15.723
Then I'll just rent it an apartment
and visit it on the side.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.168
Why don't you have a try yourself?

08:21.459 --> 08:24.257
No. You see,
I'm buying it for my father...

08:24.546 --> 08:27.618
- You must sit in it.
- Who knows other people's tastes?

08:27.924 --> 08:30.563
Something seems wrong...
Turn on this.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.756
Ohh... Oh, mommy!

08:39.519 --> 08:41.475
(Barks and growls)

08:41.770 --> 08:44.649
Eddie! What is the matter with him?

08:44.941 --> 08:47.296
He saw your father's chair was gone.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.641
He's afraid your father's gone too.
He suspects foul play.

08:51.823 --> 08:55.941
Stop it! If I'd stuck Dad's feet in cement
and thrown him into Puget Sound,

08:56.286 --> 09:00.245
you would have been
the tiny little splash that followed him!

09:00.582 --> 09:02.652
(Doorbell)

09:02.917 --> 09:06.273
Oh, that must be Leo!
Wait till you see this!

09:07.297 --> 09:09.765
- Make way.
- Just be careful.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.006
Watch the furniture and the walls.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.969
Excuse me, but I'm a professional.
I take pride in my work...

09:17.390 --> 09:21.349
How did that get there? At least
I didn't lose my licence this time.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.120
- Quickly!
- I'm sure Beavis

09:24.397 --> 09:26.353
will start to wonder where you are.

09:30.236 --> 09:33.831
Leo, we're having a problem
with a leaky faucet in the sink.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.274
- Where would that be?
- In the kitchen, dear.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.410
That wasn't a dumb question.
You got bathrooms too.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.458
None that you'll be going
anywhere near.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.661
It's lovely!

09:45.919 --> 09:48.956
I thought the other one was nice,
but this is smashing!

09:49.255 --> 09:52.645
Try it out.
And it has a little surprise.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.401
Ooh. This is comfy.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.796
Although it's a little on the soft side.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.851
I prefer...

10:02.936 --> 10:04.847
Hello.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.824
Ohh... Ohh... Ohh...

10:08.108 --> 10:10.064
This is enough
to make me give up me search

10:10.318 --> 10:12.309
for a meaningful relationship.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.880
Oh, quick! Dad! Get out!

10:16.157 --> 10:18.307
Oh, all right! Just like a man!

10:18.576 --> 10:21.693
Now you've had your fun,
you don't care where I am!

10:25.333 --> 10:29.884
- Hey there.
- Hi, Dad. I've got a surprise for you.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.737
- What's that?
- It's your new easy chair!

10:35.927 --> 10:39.442
Well, what do you know about that?

10:39.764 --> 10:43.040
- Where's my old chair?
- In the storage space. Try this.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.501
Look, I appreciate this, Frasier,

10:45.770 --> 10:47.920
but that... It really isn't me.

10:48.189 --> 10:53.217
Dad, you haven't even sat in it yet.
Come on down, Martin Crane.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.577
That's disgusting!

11:08.043 --> 11:14.039
I'm sorry, but I'm a creature of habit.
I think I'd rather have my old chair back.

11:14.466 --> 11:18.345
But why? This chair is a lot more
comfortable and it's therapeutic.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.192
I know, I just never cared for leather.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.431
You stick to it in hot weather,
you can't sit in it in shorts.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.604
It makes my back sweat. Black's hot.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.615
I'm sorry, I just couldn't get used to it.

11:30.899 --> 11:35.927
All right. The important thing is that you
lived with it for a full 15 seconds. Leo!

11:37.447 --> 11:40.439
Leo, bring Mr Crane's chair back.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.859
- Sorry, Fish 'n' Chips. Someone took it.
- What?

11:44.162 --> 11:47.791
Someone broke into my storage space
and stole the chair?

11:48.124 --> 11:51.480
- Storage space?
- That's where I told you to put it!

11:51.795 --> 11:54.025
Not another day like last Tuesday.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.882
- Where is it?
- It was snagged from the dumpster.

11:59.177 --> 12:03.295
- I almost kept it myself.
- You threw it away! You happy now?

12:03.640 --> 12:06.757
You have to find it.
I don't care what you have to do.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.496
- Just find the chair!
- "Dump the chair, get the chair."

12:10.814 --> 12:12.770
- Am I the building lackey?
- YES!

12:13.024 --> 12:14.776
Oh, OK.

12:17.570 --> 12:22.769
Well, if no one's going to want this,
we could put it in my room.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.779
Maybe later. You two talk it over.

12:29.082 --> 12:33.314
You've been trying to get rid of it
from the day I moved in!

12:33.670 --> 12:37.299
You could at least show
a little gratitude. I did this for you.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.430
- Like hell!
- You think I lost it on purpose?

12:40.719 --> 12:44.314
Let me tell you something.
That chair was the only thing

12:44.639 --> 12:48.393
that made me feel comfortable,
like maybe this was my home too.

12:48.727 --> 12:52.163
Ever since you got here,
I've tried to make you comfortable.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.994
But why?
Everybody knows Martin Crane

12:55.275 --> 12:57.550
doesn't like calfskin!
He prefers duct tape!

12:59.946 --> 13:02.585
And food crumbs!

13:02.866 --> 13:07.894
There we are. And let's have a dribble
of beer while we're at it! Delightful!

13:08.288 --> 13:12.964
Let's not forget, to top it all off,
just the slightest bit of dog hair, hmm?

13:17.213 --> 13:19.773
I suppose you'll throw Eddie out next?

13:20.050 --> 13:24.248
We're talking about
a 25-year-old broken-down chair!

13:24.596 --> 13:27.588
If you don't like this chair,
I'll get you any one you want!

13:27.891 --> 13:30.769
All right, I'll tell you what chair I want.

13:31.061 --> 13:35.054
The chair I was in
when Armstrong walked on the Moon

13:35.398 --> 13:38.196
and when the US hockey team
beat the Russians.

13:39.611 --> 13:43.047
The one I was in when you called me
to say I had a grandson.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.714
The one I was in all those nights
when your mother used to

13:48.036 --> 13:51.108
wake me up with a kiss
after I'd fallen asleep in front of the TV.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.803
I still fall asleep in it.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.917
Every once in a while when I wake up,

13:57.212 --> 14:00.921
I still expect your mother
to be there to lead me off to bed.

14:03.885 --> 14:08.003
Oh, never mind. It's only a chair.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.882
Come on, Eddie.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.623
- How was your weekend?
- Hellish.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.175
Let me tell you what happened to me.

14:21.444 --> 14:25.357
I had the most incredible date Saturday!
It was really hot!

14:25.699 --> 14:27.769
- Sunday, I'm driving home...
- Sunday?

14:28.034 --> 14:30.025
I told you it was hot.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.846
My car breaks down
in front of a church,

14:33.123 --> 14:35.159
people are coming out after the show...

14:35.417 --> 14:36.816
- Service.
- What?

14:37.043 --> 14:39.398
Churches have services.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.265
- Can I finish my story?
- All right.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.188
Thank you.
So, I walk up to the minister.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.424
I ask him if I can use his phone,

14:47.679 --> 14:50.637
and he tells me
my sweater's on inside out.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.122
We have a date tonight.
Ministers aren't celibate, are they?

14:56.855 --> 14:59.323
Not that I don't love a challenge.

15:01.067 --> 15:06.016
Maybe you should take a sick day,
call into the show yourself.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.709
You're on the air.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.746
Good afternoon.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

15:13.038 --> 15:17.270
Before I take my first caller,
I'd like to make a personal appeal.

15:17.625 --> 15:22.904
Saturday, my father's chair was taken
from outside the Elliot Bay Towers.

15:23.298 --> 15:28.088
It's a runny, split-pea green
and mud-brown striped recliner

15:28.470 --> 15:34.227
with some stuffing popping out
from underneath a strip of duct tape.

15:36.061 --> 15:41.089
I'm offering a handsome reward
for its safe return. Thank you.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.872
- Who's on line one?
- It's John...

15:44.152 --> 15:48.191
So remember, Stephanie, a little
emotional flexibility is a good thing.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.489
Just as the mighty oak
snaps and falls in a windstorm,

15:51.785 --> 15:56.495
so the weeping willow bends
and lives to see another day.

15:56.873 --> 16:00.707
Thank you.
So, any update on the chair?

16:01.044 --> 16:04.673
- The calls have been pouring in.
- Really? What are they?

16:05.006 --> 16:09.443
Spotted at the top of the Space Needle,
in the Governor's mansion...

16:09.803 --> 16:12.078
One man saw it flying over his house,

16:12.347 --> 16:15.100
but thought
it was just a tacky spaceship.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.886
Funny stuff, people.
Let's just go to commercial break

16:21.189 --> 16:25.102
so you all can chuckle through
these words from Yukon Lumber.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.397
Ingrates!

16:28.655 --> 16:32.045
I clear away their psychic debris,
and this is how they repay me.

16:32.367 --> 16:36.326
Uh-huh. I got it. He'll be there
after the show. Thank you.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.257
- I found the chair!
- Oh, thank God!

16:39.541 --> 16:41.532
By tonight, my dad will be safely back

16:41.793 --> 16:44.830
in his beer-stained,
flea-infested, duct-taped recliner,

16:45.130 --> 16:48.805
adjusting his shorts and
cheering on Jean-Claude van Damme.

16:50.802 --> 16:55.557
Yes, it's quite a little piece of heaven
I've carved out for myself.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.018
(Choking)

17:05.191 --> 17:08.023
OK, OK, that was nice.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.958
Er, but let's just remember,

17:11.239 --> 17:14.675
there is a fine line between
good acting and hamming it up.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.268
- Let's try again.
- Excuse me...

17:17.537 --> 17:20.768
- I can't find my moustache.
- I can't remember any of my lines.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.675
- I'm really nervous.
- Me too.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.555
- Can you all come here for a second?
- Mrs Warren?

17:32.260 --> 17:37.175
This isn't Broadway, it's junior high.
No reason at all to be nervous.

17:37.557 --> 17:42.472
We'll go out there tonight in front of
family and friends and have fun, OK?

17:42.854 --> 17:45.493
- OK!
- If one more thing goes wrong,

17:45.774 --> 17:48.129
I'll have to take my own life.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.296
- If I could have a word with you.
- Sorry.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.723
In 45 minutes, a shaky production
of "Ten Little Indians" starts.

17:56.034 --> 18:00.949
Oh. I recognised the <i>mise en scène.</i>
I did this play years ago.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.083
"On the contrary,

18:03.333 --> 18:05.801
"many a psychotic killer
appears to be quite normal.

18:06.086 --> 18:09.965
"You can never suspect
that underneath that calm exterior

18:10.298 --> 18:13.847
"there lies the heart
of a maniac. Ha-ha."

18:14.177 --> 18:16.293
It happens to be true, by the way.

18:18.181 --> 18:21.491
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm Dr Frasier Crane.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.650
From the radio. KACL talk...
Never mind.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.328
I was told my chair would be here.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.281
I'll just get this out of your hair,
if I may.

18:31.569 --> 18:36.643
Excuse me. Right now this chair's
the most entertaining thing on stage.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.503
- That's true, but...
- Ow! Ah!

18:40.829 --> 18:45.903
Just run along to the nurse's office.
They'll have you back here soon.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.647
I am so sick of being positive.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.072
This chair belongs to my father,
and I must return it to him.

18:53.425 --> 18:57.134
Sir, you can have it back in two weeks.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.426
I'm in a difficult position.

18:59.681 --> 19:02.514
Difficult? You want difficult?

19:02.809 --> 19:08.281
I have a rickety set, a leading man
whose voice changed at 3:00 pm today,

19:08.690 --> 19:11.523
and my name
is spelt wrong in the programme!

19:13.528 --> 19:19.398
See what I did there? That's the kind
of anger I want in the accusation scene.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.784
- I'll give you $200 for a new chair.
- Forget it.

19:23.079 --> 19:26.754
Mrs Warren, I am speaking
to you now from the heart.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.359
By putting this chair into the trash,
I have wounded my father.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.265
It's just a chair to you. To him,
it is a treasure trove of memories.

19:34.591 --> 19:38.789
I thoughtlessly discarded it
because I didn't like it in my living room!

19:39.137 --> 19:42.095
I have sacrificed
heart and soul for form and function!

19:42.390 --> 19:44.346
I am ashamed for that!

19:44.601 --> 19:46.557
This chair is the last chance

19:46.811 --> 19:50.645
to forge a meaningful relationship
with the only father I'll ever have!

19:53.360 --> 19:56.318
People, were you all listening to that?

19:56.613 --> 19:59.286
Because you can learn
a lot from this man.

19:59.574 --> 20:03.169
That speech he just gave
is a perfect example

20:03.495 --> 20:07.204
of the kind of hammy overacting
I don't want to see out of you.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.735
- Hold on!
- Mrs Warren!

20:10.001 --> 20:12.117
Bobby just threw up backstage!

20:12.379 --> 20:15.610
Perfect. My Dr Armstrong
has opening-night jitters.

20:15.924 --> 20:19.155
No, it's stomach flu.
He's in the nurse's office.

20:19.469 --> 20:23.223
You'll have to cancel the performance.
Too bad. I'll just take this.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.946
I can't cancel.
I have 300 parents in their cars already.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.498
The American theatre will survive.

20:29.771 --> 20:34.083
You can't do the show without
Dr Armstrong. That's the part I played.

20:36.027 --> 20:40.464
- You played Dr Armstrong?
- Well, yes... Oh, no. You're not...

20:40.824 --> 20:42.974
How badly do you want your chair?

20:43.243 --> 20:45.473
I'm sorry. It's out of the question!

20:45.745 --> 20:48.976
You know, it would be
a real shame if something...

20:49.290 --> 20:52.441
Oh!...happened to this chair.

20:54.212 --> 20:57.284
But it's been years!
I hardly can remember any of the lines!

20:57.590 --> 21:00.150
Then you'll fit right in.

21:03.555 --> 21:05.307
(Applause)

21:15.942 --> 21:17.933
(Indistinct)

21:29.372 --> 21:33.490
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

21:34.544 --> 21:36.182
# Oh, my!

21:36.421 --> 21:42.178
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but I got you pegged!

21:43.636 --> 21:49.154
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

21:50.477 --> 21:52.786
# They're calling again

21:53.313 --> 21:57.989
# Scrambled eggs all over my face
What is a boy to do? #

22:00.153 --> 22:01.268
Thank you!
