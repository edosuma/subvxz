WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.540
[Wags] Previously
on Billions.

00:06.573 --> 00:08.409
I want to introduce
the chairman of

00:08.442 --> 00:11.045
the NYC 2028
Olympic Commission,

00:11.078 --> 00:12.046
-Michael Prince.
-[applause]

00:12.079 --> 00:13.514
Thank you, Mayor Johnson.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.482
You promised me
a winning season, Chuck.

00:15.515 --> 00:16.984
Running out of time
before I‘ll have to quit,

00:17.017 --> 00:18.552
campaign 25/8.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.188
I can‘t lose my MVP yet.
I need you, Kate.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.790
Chuck Rhoades is fucking
with our Wi-Fi play.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.192
The only winner in
this hopeless fucking outing

00:25.225 --> 00:26.627
is gonna be your
chief legal counsel.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.429
You think I‘m
concerned because you

00:28.462 --> 00:30.397
brought my Wi-Fi play
back to Chuck?

00:30.430 --> 00:32.566
It‘s how I know that you‘ll
serve me loyally as well,

00:32.599 --> 00:34.568
until I help get you
elected to Congress.

00:34.601 --> 00:35.803
You made a deal that you
knew would displease me.

00:35.836 --> 00:38.539
I thought we could actually
change the world.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.141
If you want to change the world,
nine digits ain‘t gonna do it.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.276
How could you, Kate?

00:42.309 --> 00:43.444
After all I taught you.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.546
[Sacker]
You made me wait.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.880
[Chuck] What if the professor
isn‘t done teaching?

00:46.913 --> 00:48.482
[Prince] This is business.

00:48.515 --> 00:50.150
This is what not having
a soft landing feels like.

00:50.183 --> 00:51.452
You tear your butt
when you hit the ground.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.487
Mike Prince and his daughters

00:53.520 --> 00:54.521
made the world
a better place today.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.191
[Chuck]
I lost my advantage.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.693
I failed to protect
my goddamn queen.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.495
Welcome to
Michael Prince Capital, Kate.

01:21.681 --> 01:22.716
[indistinct chatter]

01:22.749 --> 01:24.585
My God, let me finish!

01:24.618 --> 01:26.653
When was I not
letting you finish?

01:41.368 --> 01:44.805
Worked pretty well in
Stand and Deliver too.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.173
Life lesson,

01:46.206 --> 01:48.775
always carry a cleaver.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.444
Oh, wait. No.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.012
That‘s not really the lesson.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.647
The lesson is,

01:53.680 --> 01:56.884
know how to change
the mood in a room quickly

01:56.917 --> 01:58.552
and with authority.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.420
Now, look, I get
what you‘re fighting over.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.588
I do.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.490
Coding team wants
more of the budget

02:03.523 --> 02:05.626
because you can‘t make
a great app without great code.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.794
Sales team wants more because
who cares about the damn code--

02:07.827 --> 02:09.963
You want to start moving
product out the door.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.865
Same with the marketing group.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.466
But here‘s the deal.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.970
Your customer can have
two of these,

02:17.003 --> 02:18.472
not three.

02:18.505 --> 02:20.474
Cheap and fast
can‘t also be good.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.442
Good and fast
can‘t also be cheap.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.379
So you can fight over turf,

02:25.412 --> 02:26.713
or...

02:28.014 --> 02:30.250
you can figure out a vision.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.187
Let the budget sort itself out.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.221
[Prince] Or I can double it.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.691
Everybody gets what they want,

02:37.724 --> 02:39.660
and I get a word
with the teacher outside.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.828
Not sure that‘s
the right lesson.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.931
Most important one:
"Money makes the rules."

02:43.964 --> 02:46.833
I‘m surprised an esteemed
charter school like this

02:46.866 --> 02:49.369
hasn‘t hammered it
into their heads.

02:49.402 --> 02:52.039
Why scrap over capital
when you can raise it?

02:52.072 --> 02:54.174
Group, we‘re gonna take five

02:54.207 --> 02:56.276
while Mr. Prince
makes out his check.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.314
If you came here
to impress a bunch of

03:00.347 --> 03:01.782
teenage entrepreneurs...

03:01.815 --> 03:02.883
Trying to impress you.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.018
Hire you.
How am I doing?

03:05.051 --> 03:06.353
You opening a charter school?

03:06.386 --> 03:08.188
Not for your side gig.
Your main gig.

03:08.221 --> 03:10.090
They take care of me
at the fund I‘m at.

03:10.123 --> 03:13.360
Hmm-hmm. That‘s why your
resume‘s floating around.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.562
In my weaker moments,
I sometimes think about

03:15.595 --> 03:17.764
what I could do in a place
built for speed and power.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.632
Then you‘re
talking to the right guy.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.704
[knock on door]

03:27.040 --> 03:29.109
Um,

03:29.142 --> 03:30.276
what‘d you do?

03:31.077 --> 03:32.579
Nothing.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.448
Women can be irrational,
we know this.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.016
"We" do not.
What‘d you do?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.284
Not a thing.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.453
I went unattended
to a couples dinner.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.888
Willow had a cold,
so Roxanne couldn‘t go.

03:41.921 --> 03:44.124
And the distaff side of
the other couple

03:44.157 --> 03:45.826
was a fetching brunette...

03:45.859 --> 03:46.727
Yeah, you had an affair.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.462
Spare me the Penthouse Forum.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.964
No-siree-Bob.
Nothing physical.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.733
Developed a kinship

03:52.766 --> 03:56.103
with Judith Felker,
Ron‘s wife,

03:56.136 --> 03:58.839
over how thin the consommé was.

03:58.872 --> 04:02.175
So uh, Roxanne kicked you out
over dinner table chatter?

04:02.208 --> 04:04.778
Well, the next six days
of text chatter didn‘t help.

04:04.811 --> 04:08.782
Did you know that Face ID
works when you‘re asleep?

04:08.815 --> 04:10.083
Why wouldn‘t it?

04:10.116 --> 04:11.385
You oughta go after
Big Tech.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.487
I dozed off mid-emoji,

04:13.520 --> 04:15.789
Roxanne grabbed the damn phone
and saw it all.

04:15.822 --> 04:19.826
I‘ll just drop this here
while I test the beds,

04:19.859 --> 04:21.828
pick out a room.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.980
The thing about self-help is,

04:40.013 --> 04:41.915
if you‘re getting it
from someone else it‘s not self,

04:41.948 --> 04:44.284
and if you‘re doing it yourself,
you didn‘t really get help.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.891
Carlin.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.126
George Carlin. No?

04:53.159 --> 04:54.661
Yeah. All-time great.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.730
But not quite like Coach Wooden.

04:56.763 --> 05:00.033
See, he wasn‘t an entertainer.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.335
He understood life.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.803
Codified what he learned,

05:02.836 --> 05:04.571
taught it
to his basketball players,

05:04.604 --> 05:05.906
made it available
to the rest of us.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.276
As I am now making it
available to you.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.978
"Initiative," "skill,"

05:12.011 --> 05:15.449
it all seems kinda... basic.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.684
Not ItsMeTinx basic.
Like what it used to mean.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.519
I met him once,
when we won State‘s.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.388
Fundamental, not basic.
It‘s different.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.290
What‘d he teach ya?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.659
How to put on my socks
and shoes.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.627
How to lace ‘em up
and tie ‘em right.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.062
Know why?

05:29.095 --> 05:30.297
Blisters?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.631
To remember that
every season,

05:31.664 --> 05:33.133
we start again
from the beginning.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.737
We were champions
of this season. Not the next.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.738
So we‘d better do
everything right.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.908
Plus, yeah, blisters.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.144
Not self-help.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.878
Help.

05:55.488 --> 05:58.024
-Who‘s that?
-Beats me.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.360
Ten bucks says
he doesn‘t have any blisters.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.831
[rings bell]

06:35.161 --> 06:39.065
Remember, you‘re bowing
to the Buddha, not me.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.833
Yes.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.104
[Wendy exhales]

06:44.137 --> 06:45.238
Daniel.

06:45.271 --> 06:46.806
I‘m ready.

06:48.107 --> 06:52.112
Is that the first sign
of readiness, do we think?

06:52.145 --> 06:54.714
Stating it.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.617
Are you suggesting I‘m
not ready to take refuge?

06:59.018 --> 07:00.019
Because I have to.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.456
I need to.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.860
What‘s that?

07:06.893 --> 07:07.894
Vegan ice cream.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.030
A gift for you.
It‘s the best--

07:10.063 --> 07:11.264
No.

07:11.297 --> 07:12.799
What‘s that?

07:13.666 --> 07:16.436
A gift for you,
as I said.

07:16.469 --> 07:17.938
I made it myself.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.372
For what purpose?

07:19.405 --> 07:23.276
For... to, uh...

07:23.309 --> 07:24.844
To curry favor.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.315
The very sweetness
of the cream

07:28.348 --> 07:29.983
is bitter in this way.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.818
Do not buy friendship

07:31.851 --> 07:33.019
or comfort.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.659
Where I come from,

07:39.692 --> 07:42.195
everything‘s a transaction.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.197
Where you‘re going...

07:44.230 --> 07:45.665
a commitment to the Buddha,

07:45.698 --> 07:48.768
the Dharma, the Sangha,

07:48.801 --> 07:52.805
the goal is to avoid
being transactional at all.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.976
Can you do this?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.677
Will you try?

07:58.978 --> 08:01.248
I‘ll start with a month.
Go from there.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.449
Start with a day.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.551
When I decide something--

08:04.584 --> 08:07.453
Start with an hour,
even a minute.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.022
Then add a minute to that one.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.760
That‘s the work.

08:13.793 --> 08:17.831
We‘ll meet in four days,
see how it‘s going.

08:17.864 --> 08:20.267
You‘re not sure
I can refrain from transacting

08:20.300 --> 08:21.668
for four days?

08:21.701 --> 08:24.804
Whether I‘m sure
matters not at all.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.507
Well, I am.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.643
I‘m sure.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.581
All right, rack the bid,
get it done.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.252
What‘s he,
the new golden boy?

08:39.285 --> 08:41.388
Took Dollar Bill‘s slot.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.924
Probably looking for the
actual dollar to steal too.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.192
[Prince]
Coach Wooden always said,

08:46.225 --> 08:49.195
"I treat my players fairly,
but not equally.

08:49.228 --> 08:50.864
Depends on performance."

08:50.897 --> 08:52.866
And that‘s what we are
evaluating now. Performance.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.035
Evaluate and decide who starts,
who rides the pine--

08:55.068 --> 08:57.337
And who gets
their scholarship pulled.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.105
[Prince] Now, I‘ve always
believed you live in a house

08:59.138 --> 09:00.607
before renovating,

09:00.640 --> 09:02.943
so you don‘t sledgehammer
a support beam,

09:02.976 --> 09:05.278
put a Barcalounger where
the bar should be.

09:05.311 --> 09:08.114
Well, our grace period here
is coming to an end.

09:08.147 --> 09:12.218
This Friday, I‘m reallocating
capital at the firm.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.520
If you change strategies,

09:13.553 --> 09:15.355
if you stray
from the fundamentals,

09:15.388 --> 09:17.023
I‘ll see it, so don‘t.

09:17.056 --> 09:21.094
Position sizing,
focus, restraint--

09:21.127 --> 09:24.864
consider them our
load-bearing walls.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.366
And, uh, oh, yeah,
do your best.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.401
For you.

09:28.434 --> 09:30.170
To return to Coach Wooden,

09:30.203 --> 09:32.738
"You‘re the only one who knows
whether you‘ve won."

09:35.408 --> 09:37.677
Pretty sure the guy
carving up our trading dollars

09:37.710 --> 09:39.346
knows whether we‘ve won.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.449
Was he looking at me
when he said "Barcalounger?"

09:42.482 --> 09:44.951
Listen up:
Quarter ends Friday.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.387
If you fuck up,
it‘ll be locked in,

09:47.420 --> 09:48.588
and you‘ll be locked out.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.156
What if you fuck up?

09:50.189 --> 09:52.225
Then wake the hell up
from your nightmare

09:52.258 --> 09:54.794
‘cause in this life,
I don‘t ever fuck up.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.569
I know you don‘t want me here.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.670
Got that right.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.174
[elevator bell dings]

10:13.780 --> 10:15.782
Book a room at the
Yale Club for my father.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.017
Mr. Allard needs you.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.722
Have you decided who gets
Sacker‘s office yet?

10:22.755 --> 10:25.057
Bureau chiefs
have been eyeing it.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.729
That‘s Graceland,
we‘re not touching it.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.369
Good. I need ya.

10:36.402 --> 10:37.637
No, you need Marie Kondo.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.239
Jesus Christ.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.075
You got Aaron Burr‘s
gun permit lost in here?

10:42.108 --> 10:43.677
But let me guess,
you know where everything is,

10:43.710 --> 10:45.211
down to the last carbon.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.546
Nope. Not a clue.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.249
Where are we on the prosecutions
Sacker left behind?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.151
Flailing, Chuck.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.253
I have to admit, I‘m not
as savvy on the legal stuff

10:53.286 --> 10:55.522
as certain other
aspects of the job.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.424
Like this one.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.093
Big seafood wholesaler.
Mislabeled half its product,

11:00.126 --> 11:01.861
stuck people
with cheaper fish instead.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.297
The seafood fraud case,
we need a win on that.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.299
To stand with the consumers
who‘re being fleeced.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.368
Well, we may need
a different opposing counsel.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.237
Lady‘s a pit bull,
won‘t settle it out.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.039
Even though
we got her dead to rights.

11:13.072 --> 11:16.409
I see that you
did need me. Okay.

11:16.442 --> 11:19.479
-I‘ll handle it.
-Good.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.748
But that‘s not why I needed ya.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.317
Last night, in a private
suite at the Garden,

11:24.350 --> 11:27.253
a young woman walks up
to Governor Sweeney,

11:27.286 --> 11:29.055
told him he‘s wrecking
the Empire State...

11:29.088 --> 11:32.225
-Hmm.
-...and not that nicely.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.293
People heard it.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.428
My sources tell me
it was Gail Prince.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.531
-Mike Prince‘s--
-Oh, I know who she is.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.166
Governor Sweeney
still doesn‘t.

11:42.101 --> 11:45.205
Buffalo Bob finds that out,
he‘s gonna get ornery.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.740
Page Six.
Call over there and--

11:46.773 --> 11:48.441
That I know how to do.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.743
This‘ll be sweet.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.411
As a Coolatta
with extra syrup.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.147
The Commission never awards
the Games to a place

11:54.180 --> 11:56.082
it doesn‘t feel
completely welcome in.

11:56.115 --> 11:57.283
So...

11:57.316 --> 11:58.685
This should pretty much
lead to the end

11:58.718 --> 12:00.352
of Mike Prince‘s Olympic bid.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.364
Don‘t call my mom
till I can explain--

12:11.397 --> 12:13.799
Mom already got the call.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.237
Let‘s get
Kate Sacker in here.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.239
First, I‘d like to get
Philip Charyn out of here,

12:19.272 --> 12:20.974
and understand how
he even got in.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.609
It was no setup.
I looked at the resumes

12:22.642 --> 12:24.310
the headhunter sent blind.

12:24.343 --> 12:26.045
Who else has that
many degrees from Stanford,

12:26.078 --> 12:29.149
and Yale and Chicago?
You knew.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.284
You kept your nephew out of
the Prince Companies for years.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.085
I win this round.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.363
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.366
[laughs]

12:49.202 --> 12:51.304
Philip is Scooter‘s
sister‘s kid.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.773
Managed $300 million
in tech at his last firm.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.508
Prince bought out his contract.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.811
That means he‘ll get a big
hunk of our allocations.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.546
And our comp.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.615
Don Fanucci‘s nephew‘s
not touching my smock.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.217
For the record,
offer me a basket

13:04.250 --> 13:06.152
of fruit and veggies,
I‘m taking it.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.154
Keep up the bucket shop
bullshit and you‘ll need it.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.990
Mike said no
changing strategies.

13:11.023 --> 13:13.927
Too bad for you,
that means losing ones too.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.930
Oh, no fucking way
I get bounced over you.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.667
Guys, since "sincerity"
is the mortar

13:20.700 --> 13:24.003
that holds the "team spirit"
and "loyalty" blocks together,

13:24.036 --> 13:26.639
maybe we share information.

13:26.672 --> 13:29.609
Best practices?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.011
What is this Commie shit,
from Mao‘s Little Red Book?

13:32.044 --> 13:34.647
It‘s from the pyramid.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.148
On the fridge?

13:43.089 --> 13:45.058
Biggest hurdle we‘re facing,
Governor Sweeney.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.427
The International Commission
of Sport is shy,

13:47.460 --> 13:49.095
won‘t go where it‘s not wanted.
Never does.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.263
Which is why
you‘ll win him over

13:50.296 --> 13:52.064
in the meeting
I‘ve set for you.

13:54.634 --> 13:55.902
Yeah, I work quick.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.403
It‘s what you brought me in for.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.072
I need to know what to
expect from Chuck Rhoades

13:59.105 --> 14:01.975
by way of interference.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.509
I could use
you on the floor.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.311
To clarify reallocation.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.780
-I was perfectly clear.
-As Baccarat crystal.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.482
What I really need is a referee.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.318
It‘s a captain‘s practice,
Wags. Work it out.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.596
[Winston] I thought
you were a vegan.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.198
It‘s true what they say,
"Never work for your heroes."

14:28.768 --> 14:31.203
[crunches]

14:35.441 --> 14:38.344
Nope. All of it is vegan.
Flatware too.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.280
Terravore, the plant-based
meat company,

14:40.313 --> 14:41.781
just rolled up
six other vegan innovators.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.583
We‘re buying in.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.618
Um, the fork thing‘s
super cool, but Terravore‘s

14:45.651 --> 14:47.754
kind of a big fat yawn
in the plant-based space.

14:47.787 --> 14:50.757
India alone discards 120 billion
plastic utensils a year.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.459
-The market potential‘s robust.
-The forks aren‘t.

14:53.492 --> 14:55.461
Millet‘s pretty breakable,
so pricey to ship.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.630
Everybody‘s allocation‘s
up for grabs.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.667
This is the week to be
ruthlessly strategic.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.101
Here‘s the strategy,

15:02.134 --> 15:03.903
We calculate
the largest position

15:03.936 --> 15:05.905
we can buy in Terravore,
then we buy it.

15:11.777 --> 15:14.213
[sighs]

15:15.214 --> 15:17.583
Governor thing
just got a lot harder.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.119
New York Post says Gail
insulted him to his face.

15:20.152 --> 15:21.721
Practically spit in it.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.289
-My Gail?
-Sorry to say.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.757
It‘s what I came to tell you.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.159
Your meeting with him is off,

15:26.192 --> 15:28.394
unless Gail plans to be
there to apologize

15:28.427 --> 15:30.964
and then to publicly
recant to the paper.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.299
Get him on the phone.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.501
He‘s not going to
take my call, is he?

15:40.272 --> 15:43.309
Gail, it‘s Dad.
Call me back.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.511
-I‘ll reach her. Just, uh...
-She might take my call.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.480
Not your job.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.652
I just needed you to see me
on your call sheet today.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.955
To know I‘m with you,
regardless of who isn‘t.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.991
"Rich Kid Schools Gov."

15:58.024 --> 16:00.293
Prince family punchline.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.895
Monologue jokes can‘t be
far fucking behind.

16:02.928 --> 16:05.497
Allow me to suggest
the proper tonic...

16:06.799 --> 16:08.568
a restorative
trip to Lake Placid.

16:08.601 --> 16:12.772
And the state debt incurred
during those Games.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.140
Why is she lashing out at me?

16:14.173 --> 16:15.341
[Andy] Maybe because
she actually--

16:15.374 --> 16:16.909
just goin‘ out on
a limb here--

16:16.942 --> 16:18.745
has a problem
with the governor.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.379
At the exact moment I‘m
wooing him for the Games?

16:21.947 --> 16:23.583
I say hear her out.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.519
She‘d have to pick up
the phone for that.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.988
I‘m calling a family summit.
I need you to fly in

16:29.021 --> 16:30.323
to help the
conversation flow and--

16:30.356 --> 16:32.191
You need me
to help get Gail there,

16:32.224 --> 16:33.326
that‘s what you need.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.528
-Thank you. Yes.
-I can‘t.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.364
I‘m packing for a different
summit, Lizard Head Peak.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.199
It‘s only a five-day window,
and not even you

16:40.232 --> 16:41.868
can raise the temperature
by ten degrees.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.137
Our daughter just jacked it up
by a lot more than that.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.338
I need everyone there
so I can lower it.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.409
She gets it from you, y‘know.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.210
Not cowed by power,
or anything, really.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.246
I‘m sending a plane.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.981
You‘ll be on Lizard Head
before the anvil hits.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.249
And if I drop
everything for you,

16:56.282 --> 16:57.416
what does that say to the kids?

16:58.984 --> 17:02.054
It says you‘re strong enough
not to stand on ceremony.

17:04.323 --> 17:06.359
We‘re 5X in Terravore now.
And we were noisy.

17:06.392 --> 17:07.994
The Street knows we‘re all-in.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.562
Good. What about
the call options?

17:09.595 --> 17:11.030
We‘re out of the money.
Like, way, way out.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.365
$20 above current price.

17:12.398 --> 17:14.167
-Also good.
-[Winston] Why‘s it good?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.902
These calls expire in weeks,

17:15.935 --> 17:17.670
worthless if we don‘t hit
the target, which we won‘t.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.872
[Rein] Either you know
something we don‘t,

17:19.905 --> 17:22.208
or you‘re shoving a wrench
into the gears as payback

17:22.241 --> 17:24.911
for Prince gutting
the Africa Wi-Fi play.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.312
My buy raised a red flag

17:26.345 --> 17:28.014
because it‘s not
customary for me,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.549
so you‘re here
to wag a finger.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.317
But I‘m comfortable
with my decision.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.885
You can carry on
with your day.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.387
Preempting me,

17:34.420 --> 17:35.955
satisfying as it may be
for you,

17:35.988 --> 17:38.224
doesn‘t change my warning.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.793
There is no bumping
the pinball machine

17:40.826 --> 17:42.462
at Michael Prince Capital.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.596
Unh.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.231
Don‘t do that.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.599
But he‘s right.
You‘re trading this stock

17:46.632 --> 17:48.634
as if you know something
you shouldn‘t.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.536
And I won‘t be the only one
who sees this, which is why

17:50.569 --> 17:52.271
he dragged me in here even
though I have better shit to do.

17:52.304 --> 17:53.706
And if there is a bump.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.374
Mnh.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.543
It carries criminal penalties.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.213
Not a bump or a nudge or
a kick to the coin box.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.347
I believe in the company.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.583
Then I believe
I‘ll be watching.

18:20.299 --> 18:22.301
Less imposing than I expected.

18:22.334 --> 18:23.870
That‘s the thing
about government offices.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.872
The power comes from the man,
not the trappings.

18:25.905 --> 18:29.141
What makes you think I‘m
talking about the trappings?

18:31.911 --> 18:33.379
Ms. Mahar,

18:33.412 --> 18:35.381
-or may I call you Daevisha?
-Call me Dave.

18:35.414 --> 18:36.549
It‘s good enough
for Starbucks--

18:36.582 --> 18:38.484
Dave, you can drop
the posturing.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.520
Your client‘s guilty,
of literal bait-and-switch.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.356
I can assure you, what‘s
good enough for Starbucks

18:43.389 --> 18:44.957
isn‘t good enough for
the people of this state.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.993
They want their fish
called by their proper names.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.594
Absolutely.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.296
There‘s no light
between our positions.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.932
Well, other than
the sweet burden of proof.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.566
Which you bear.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.004
You know, I read about you,
and I expected--

18:58.037 --> 18:59.372
Someone subservient?

18:59.405 --> 19:00.973
-No. A better person.
-Oh.

19:01.006 --> 19:03.376
Former public defender,
first-generation American,

19:03.409 --> 19:05.745
defending predatory rip-offs?

19:05.778 --> 19:07.813
You left out a couple
of things on my resume.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.282
Like Harvard Law, my Fulbright,

19:09.315 --> 19:10.583
and the fact that
I‘ve never lost a case.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.419
Oh, I know.
I called around, too.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.588
You used to be
a killer for our side.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.790
Now you‘re like those guys
Erin Brockovich served water to.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.660
Difference is,
I‘d know she was bluffing,

19:20.693 --> 19:23.362
and I‘d drink it down.
Glug glug glug.

19:23.395 --> 19:25.798
Well, the difference is,
I‘m not bluffing.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.700
I‘ll be trying this case
if it goes to court.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.168
No one else.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.139
I have a mountain
of DNA evidence.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.042
I‘m Lancey Howard with the
jack of diamonds in his hand.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.644
Then it‘s a good thing no one
plays five card stud anymore.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.947
I‘m twice as ready
as the Kid, anyway.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.982
I‘m stoked to go against you.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.450
Excuse me?

19:44.483 --> 19:46.018
Last prosecutor
of your vintage

19:46.051 --> 19:47.553
who stepped into court,

19:47.586 --> 19:49.422
ended up with hair dye
streaming down his face

19:49.455 --> 19:52.758
like the tears
of the clown that he is.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.703
[typing]

20:05.938 --> 20:08.774
Do I look that focused?

20:08.807 --> 20:11.043
I am that focused,

20:11.076 --> 20:13.612
I just don‘t look it.

20:17.983 --> 20:19.452
New guy.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.720
You chose the wrong desk.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.754
Oh, is that so?

20:21.787 --> 20:23.489
Yeah, we go by
Sharpe ratios here.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.558
Highest performers
on the left.

20:25.591 --> 20:26.692
Oh.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.064
My risk-adjusted return,
I‘m a 1.9.

20:32.097 --> 20:33.266
So I could take yours.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.800
But I was being polite.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.604
What are we measuring next?

20:50.349 --> 20:52.118
[Russakoff]
Patty of the week!

20:52.151 --> 20:53.519
Mmm.

20:53.552 --> 20:56.122
Good-looking chunk of chuck.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.690
Blind tasting, here we go.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.060
Mmm.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.462
[chuckles]

21:03.495 --> 21:06.832
Nice bite and mouth-feel.

21:06.865 --> 21:09.802
Good fat content
and bun-to-patty.

21:09.835 --> 21:13.806
I like American cheese
on a burger, this is cheddar.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.641
Medium juicy.

21:16.542 --> 21:19.445
Rating is,
a strong buy.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.113
Where‘s this from?

21:21.146 --> 21:23.782
[man] New place from
a graduate of Corner Bistro.

21:24.983 --> 21:26.285
Nice.

21:26.318 --> 21:28.387
Well, there you have it.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.790
Sounded like he liked it.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.692
The more he likes them,
the harder he throws them.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.560
[Russakoff] Another strong buy

21:34.593 --> 21:36.028
for all my Russakoff‘s
Raiders out there:

21:36.061 --> 21:37.396
ArpCom.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.831
It is ready to rip!

21:41.900 --> 21:45.905
[blows horn]

21:45.938 --> 21:47.239
[clicks off]

21:47.272 --> 21:48.674
Why would you watch him?

21:48.707 --> 21:50.976
Even competent day traders
rarely make gains.

21:51.009 --> 21:52.745
He is not competent.

21:52.778 --> 21:57.216
Russakoff‘s the fucking man
to like millions of bros.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.417
You‘re not one, though, so...

21:58.450 --> 22:00.753
Not the man or not a bro?

22:00.786 --> 22:02.521
If you were either,
you wouldn‘t ask.

22:02.554 --> 22:05.157
He watches because
Russakoff moves the market

22:05.190 --> 22:07.326
when he gets passionate.
It‘s a fact we don‘t like,

22:07.359 --> 22:10.029
but a legit data point
nonetheless.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.163
Now. Can we talk Terravore?

22:11.196 --> 22:12.732
Our buy inched it up to $63.00.

22:12.765 --> 22:13.899
Yay, team.

22:13.932 --> 22:16.469
That‘s still
a far climb to $75.00.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.970
The day traders just buy
what he tells them?

22:18.003 --> 22:20.473
From the depths
of their man caves, they do.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.974
And not just stonks.

22:22.007 --> 22:25.377
He‘s a lifestyle brand
unto himself.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.958
[Senior]
Made the kids dinner.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.693
You‘re welcome.

22:40.726 --> 22:43.129
You‘re supposed to be
at the Yale Club.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.264
Times like this,
a man belongs

22:45.297 --> 22:47.366
in the bosom of his family.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.468
Grab yourself a lowball.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.837
Everything we need
is right here.

22:53.972 --> 22:56.275
Have you even
tried to call Roxanne?

22:56.308 --> 22:58.277
Tendered an apology?

22:58.310 --> 22:59.812
I called Judith

22:59.845 --> 23:01.714
to be sure

23:01.747 --> 23:04.016
that I hadn‘t
crossed any lines.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.085
Well, having to check
is usually a great sign.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.420
She assured me I hadn‘t.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.422
One call down, one to go.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.390
But we got to talking.

23:11.423 --> 23:15.227
And the bons mots
were flying, Sonny,

23:15.260 --> 23:18.631
like the Algonquin in ‘23.

23:18.664 --> 23:21.400
I‘m thinking of acting
on our kinship,

23:21.433 --> 23:23.235
of consummating it.

23:23.268 --> 23:25.837
-She‘s game--
-Dad, no.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.408
What happens when
this fling ends,

23:29.441 --> 23:31.310
like all the others?

23:31.343 --> 23:35.047
And you‘ve bulldozed your
second home in as many years?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.749
It‘s not like I haven‘t
thought this through.

23:38.484 --> 23:40.919
There is a plan B.

23:42.654 --> 23:45.824
[humming "The Odd Couple"
theme]

24:02.241 --> 24:03.275
Uh.

24:03.308 --> 24:04.810
[door opens]

24:07.980 --> 24:10.449
You texted
"Emergency with your dad."

24:10.482 --> 24:12.785
He seems... fine.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.954
I appreciate
like hell you showing up.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.789
You gotta talk to him.
You‘re the only one who can.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.494
[scoffs]
Issue?

24:21.527 --> 24:23.829
He‘s forgotten he‘s married.

24:23.862 --> 24:26.265
No. No.

24:26.298 --> 24:31.170
You work him through whatever
stage life crisis this is.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.938
I help my guys at work.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.541
Our kids. Maybe now
finally myself, if I can.

24:35.574 --> 24:38.344
I came because
I thought "emergency"

24:38.377 --> 24:39.979
meant something different.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.447
Fine by me.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.882
Never got to unpack.

24:48.253 --> 24:49.722
He‘s living here now?

24:49.755 --> 24:52.391
Ergo, the emergency.
[laughs]

24:52.424 --> 24:54.527
You can go back to your...

24:54.560 --> 24:56.094
ever-expanding empire.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.432
I‘m not gonna talk to you
about Kate Sacker, either.

25:00.465 --> 25:02.501
I didn‘t say
a word about her.

25:02.534 --> 25:04.203
Even though she was poached,

25:04.236 --> 25:06.472
casus belli, a Cold War thrust
in the fucking broiler.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.841
I don‘t owe you an apology,
if that‘s what you‘re--

25:08.874 --> 25:11.143
Oh, no, I hold Prince
responsible for that, not you.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.679
You just lured her
to his temple of greed.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.481
It‘s not Axe Capital, Chuck.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.949
It‘s worse.

25:16.982 --> 25:19.051
Because it pretends
to be better.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.586
She‘s very special.

25:20.619 --> 25:23.522
And special to me.

25:23.555 --> 25:25.724
Don‘t ruin her, Wendy.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.533
Sweeney‘s hitting back.

25:34.566 --> 25:37.570
He ordered a fresh audit of
the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics,

25:37.603 --> 25:39.238
which went 320% over budget.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.006
That‘s ‘cause they were
run by resort town hacks.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.675
State‘s still paying
the damn bills.

25:42.708 --> 25:43.709
It‘s a low-grade stunt.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.411
If Sweeney takes it public,

25:45.444 --> 25:46.545
it‘ll scare off the Commission.

25:46.578 --> 25:47.713
Our bid‘ll be finished.

25:47.746 --> 25:48.914
If we were willing to consider

25:48.947 --> 25:51.016
in a carefully-worded
statement,

25:51.049 --> 25:52.451
putting some space between you
and your daughter on her--

25:52.484 --> 25:53.786
We‘re unwilling.

25:53.819 --> 25:55.054
I‘m aware that
that option is no fun,

25:55.087 --> 25:57.056
but if you paid me
to create fun,

25:57.089 --> 25:58.958
I‘d have replaced the stairs
with a water slide.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.593
-I‘m here to get you the Games--
-Do it another way.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.535
Afraid we need
a little sit-down.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.936
-What‘s the beef over?
-Gold.

26:10.969 --> 26:12.571
-He‘s long, she‘s short.
-Details.

26:12.604 --> 26:14.006
Not fucking tattling.

26:14.039 --> 26:15.574
-We‘ll work it out.
-There, you see.

26:15.607 --> 26:17.376
Before or after
your stupid position

26:17.409 --> 26:19.111
costs the firm bags o‘ cash?

26:19.144 --> 26:22.514
I meant we‘re gonna close out
your dumb fucking shorts

26:22.547 --> 26:24.350
before gold soars.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.985
This is when they need to go
to the principal‘s office.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.623
I don‘t know enough yet
to weigh in on any of this.

26:30.656 --> 26:32.458
And I‘m not inclined
to do the work

26:32.491 --> 26:34.626
to figure it out just now.

26:36.695 --> 26:39.164
Can you give us the room?

26:41.133 --> 26:42.968
Kate, you too.

26:46.838 --> 26:48.507
One, Sacker‘s right
about that statement.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.442
You should issue it.

26:50.475 --> 26:52.678
Two, you don‘t know enough yet
to make a determination?

26:52.711 --> 26:54.847
If this situation
with Gail is taking you--

26:54.880 --> 26:57.182
Bonnie‘s short is 88%
negatively correlated,

26:57.215 --> 26:59.685
Victor‘s calls
expire in six days,

26:59.718 --> 27:01.020
three-and-a-half hours--

27:01.053 --> 27:03.755
I‘m the Eye of Sauron,
I see all.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.726
But my communication
with my daughter has gone

27:07.759 --> 27:10.462
from a trickle to dead silence.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.331
The floor, the Commission,

27:12.364 --> 27:14.799
that‘s the easy stuff.

27:23.842 --> 27:26.745
[clears throat]
In my, uh,

27:26.778 --> 27:28.580
prior employment situation

27:28.613 --> 27:30.315
with He Whom
I Shall Not Mention--

27:30.348 --> 27:31.750
[Wendy]
Good policy.

27:31.783 --> 27:34.819
Yeah. With him
and the others there...

27:35.754 --> 27:37.289
I could guide them

27:37.322 --> 27:39.058
because there were
specific guard rails,

27:39.091 --> 27:40.826
things you can or cannot
do from those offices.

27:40.859 --> 27:43.495
Expectations. Limits.

27:43.528 --> 27:45.164
Even when stretched,
you kind of knew the contours.

27:45.197 --> 27:48.500
Hmm. Billionaires
are not public servants.

27:48.533 --> 27:49.868
The levers are different.

27:49.901 --> 27:51.804
Huh.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.139
Does it ever get any easier,

27:54.172 --> 27:55.974
seeing exactly what
they should do, and...

27:56.007 --> 27:58.076
not being able
to get them to do it?

28:00.746 --> 28:03.248
What‘ll happen is,

28:03.281 --> 28:05.417
you‘ll just direct it
more and more inwardly

28:05.450 --> 28:07.052
until you stop serving them.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.888
When you‘re ready.

28:09.921 --> 28:14.359
Or you‘ll get out
of it all entirely.

28:14.392 --> 28:15.461
That what you‘re doing?

28:15.494 --> 28:17.696
Me? No.

28:17.729 --> 28:21.700
I‘m thinking about
incorporating all of it.

28:21.733 --> 28:25.070
Synthesizing.
Letting go of results.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.371
Breathing.

28:26.404 --> 28:28.040
Ah, the Eastern approach.

28:28.073 --> 28:29.308
Absolutely.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.676
But the old habits.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.780
-I have this guy--
-A guy?

28:36.915 --> 28:39.051
No, not like that.
A priest. Buddhist.

28:39.084 --> 28:41.386
He‘s helping me take refuge.

28:41.419 --> 28:43.555
I tried to um, like...

28:43.588 --> 28:45.858
bribe him.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.960
I didn‘t even
realize I was doing it.

28:47.993 --> 28:50.262
Shit. You get lost like that,

28:50.295 --> 28:51.697
how‘s a naif like me
supposed to--

28:51.730 --> 28:53.232
Oh, hardly.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.534
You‘ve been balancing
these equities,

28:55.567 --> 28:56.769
the inner and the outer,

28:56.802 --> 28:59.471
for most of your life.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.473
I like the Bodhisattva way.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.008
Don‘t worry about yourself.
Enlighten others.

29:03.041 --> 29:05.644
That‘s my vibe. But, mmm...

29:05.677 --> 29:09.047
not trying to hang onto it
as tight as it seems you are.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.082
I‘m definitely
not bribing any Brahman.

29:12.517 --> 29:15.687
I imagine if you did,
they wouldn‘t see it coming.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.063
-[knocks]
-So?

29:25.096 --> 29:27.099
Sweeney wants to meet with me.

29:27.132 --> 29:29.568
About Mike Prince‘s Olympic bid.
Barely had to raise it.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.904
Feels like we got a little
breeze at our backsides.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.706
Or maybe it‘s
the Lake Placid windchill.

29:34.739 --> 29:35.874
Where are we
on an expert witness

29:35.907 --> 29:37.609
for my seafood fraud trial?

29:37.642 --> 29:40.212
I‘ve reached out to some
of the better fish DNA guys.

29:40.245 --> 29:42.881
Not better. Best.

29:42.914 --> 29:45.717
The testimony in this case
is everything.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.653
Needs to be devastating.
Undeniable.

29:47.686 --> 29:49.922
Best guy‘s named Bowen,
but he‘s not available.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.991
Locked up in cases
with other prosecutors.

29:53.024 --> 29:54.827
You sure Dave didn‘t
get him on their behalf?

29:54.860 --> 29:56.528
Yeah. He‘s not
an industry guy.

29:56.561 --> 29:57.830
He‘s state‘s expert.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.865
No, I still smell Dave here.

29:59.898 --> 30:01.500
She made sure
this Bowen was busy.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.035
Shouldn‘t matter.

30:03.068 --> 30:05.337
The other three experts
are raring to go.

30:05.370 --> 30:06.872
This is Dave Mahar.

30:06.905 --> 30:08.707
I‘m sure of it.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.976
She‘s trying to cut my damn
legs out from under me.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.778
You get to this Bowen
and let him know,

30:12.811 --> 30:14.346
he testifies in
this trial for us,

30:14.379 --> 30:16.849
he gets me this win,
or he never gets

30:16.882 --> 30:19.651
hired by any state again.

30:19.684 --> 30:20.853
Why‘s this one matter so much?

30:20.886 --> 30:23.822
She called me,
in so many words,

30:23.855 --> 30:26.725
"A Giuliani-level hack."

30:26.758 --> 30:29.061
That‘s Clubber Lang telling
Adrian he‘s more man than Rocky.

30:29.094 --> 30:31.763
I have a moral
and professional obligation

30:31.796 --> 30:34.265
to knock her
the fuck out now.

30:38.236 --> 30:41.073
I‘m gonna be flushed
with the bottom ten percent,

30:41.106 --> 30:42.074
like G.E. did every year.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.509
I‘m gonna be G.E.‘d.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.411
Lot of people here.

30:46.444 --> 30:49.348
Someone‘s gotta be
doing worse than you.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.283
Okay, that didn‘t
come out the way I--

30:51.316 --> 30:54.086
I‘m gonna ask for less assets
under management.

30:54.119 --> 30:56.121
If I‘m smaller,
more concentrated,

30:56.154 --> 30:58.123
I can carve a corridor
to a bigger profit share.

30:58.156 --> 31:00.158
No. You never ask for less.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.827
They‘ll think
something‘s wrong with you,

31:01.860 --> 31:03.361
maybe even fire you
on principle.

31:04.963 --> 31:07.432
I‘m gonna be G.E.‘d.

31:11.436 --> 31:15.007
It says, "Use the threading wire
to pull it through,

31:15.040 --> 31:16.742
then remove and discard it."

31:16.775 --> 31:18.277
I already removed
and discarded it.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.012
There was nothing
to pull through.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.447
‘Cause you removed
and discarded it!

31:23.882 --> 31:27.318
Look, if ya came to play,
the tourney‘s been delayed.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.101
[game turns on, plays tune]

31:45.470 --> 31:47.439
I need your help on
a different kind of play.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.007
A business play.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.443
Why us?

31:53.611 --> 31:55.146
Let me tell ya, bro.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.520
I know exactly what you‘re
doing with Terravore.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.055
Trying to pick a winner
in a fast-growing sector.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.423
Trying to get it added.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.124
To boost its price
and market cap by enough

32:06.157 --> 32:08.260
that it‘s added to the S&P 500.

32:08.293 --> 32:10.329
When it is, all the index funds
are forced to buy in,

32:10.362 --> 32:12.297
that‘s the rule.
Which pumps the stock even more,

32:12.330 --> 32:14.299
and you can dump it
before it cools.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.601
Good read.

32:16.634 --> 32:18.570
But, like I told you,
I believe in the company.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.773
Without documentation,
it‘s market manipulation.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.175
I prosecuted people for this.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.277
You sound like Spyros.
Assertion without proof.

32:25.310 --> 32:28.280
Here‘s what
the SEC‘s gonna ask:

32:28.313 --> 32:30.515
"Where the fuck is your proof?"

32:31.549 --> 32:34.619
♪ Here I am ♪

32:34.652 --> 32:35.721

32:35.754 --> 32:38.156

32:39.090 --> 32:41.026
Biscuits and gravy.

32:41.059 --> 32:43.962
Dad, I gotta throw
a flag on this one.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.398
Illegal
emotional manipulation.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.834
[Liz] Totally unfair
to have to smell that

32:48.867 --> 32:49.868
as we walk into the apartment.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.470
Also, it‘s not gonna work.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.238
[Andy] Bob Seger‘s
a nice touch, though.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.539
Reminds me of Sundays
when the kids were little.

32:54.572 --> 32:57.476
What? You think
would plan this out?

32:57.509 --> 32:59.978
I think you told your staff
to let you know the minute

33:00.011 --> 33:02.514
we got in the elevator so
the chorus of "Turn the Page"

33:02.547 --> 33:04.449
would hit exactly when we
walked into the kitchen.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.552
Would I be the guy
you married if I hadn‘t?

33:07.585 --> 33:10.956
I just so happened
to have a mix from Rosie‘s.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.324
They sent over a care package.

33:12.357 --> 33:14.159
After you sent
the plane for it, M-Tap?

33:14.192 --> 33:16.294
I can‘t--
Yeah, who can remember?

33:16.327 --> 33:18.030
The point is,
we‘re having some

33:18.063 --> 33:20.165
homemade Indiana
biscuits and gravy.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.134
Dad, we were summoned.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.869
I mean, I‘m not gonna
refuse the food

33:23.902 --> 33:25.470
because we all know I‘m not--

33:25.503 --> 33:26.805
I am refusing.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.740
I‘m not breaking bread
with him at this point.

33:28.773 --> 33:30.642
[Gail] Yeah, honestly,

33:30.675 --> 33:32.144
we‘re still pissed.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.912
You don‘t get
to police our emotions.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.514
Especially
about your bullshit.

33:35.547 --> 33:39.418
I just told them to go
at it straight.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.752
Good. Yes.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.354
Let‘s get into it

33:42.387 --> 33:44.189
Because I-I can‘t
live with things being

33:44.222 --> 33:46.892
catawampus like this
between us anymore.

33:46.925 --> 33:48.727
You‘re right. I was not

33:48.760 --> 33:51.296
entirely forthright about
the cannabis company thing.

33:51.329 --> 33:53.565
Forthright? So you‘re
a soft peddler now.

33:53.598 --> 33:55.634
You‘d rather I be
as direct as you were

33:55.667 --> 33:57.069
with Governor Sweeney?

33:57.102 --> 33:58.804
She was right to say
what she said.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.073
She may have been, but it
doesn‘t mean she had to say it.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.040
You‘re on his side?

34:02.073 --> 34:04.242
I‘m on all your sides.

34:04.275 --> 34:06.244
There‘s... there‘s no sides.

34:06.277 --> 34:08.046
I mean, there‘s--
there‘s one damn side.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.182
I mean, Gail and I
are kind of a side,

34:10.215 --> 34:12.216
and you‘re usually on it.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.420
What your sister said put
a lot of pressure on your dad

34:15.453 --> 34:17.722
when he‘s trying
to accomplish a difficult...

34:17.755 --> 34:20.225
really hard... thing.

34:20.258 --> 34:22.928
-It means a hell of a lot.
-To you and him.

34:22.961 --> 34:25.397
Because if he locks this down,
you get a thing, too.

34:25.430 --> 34:28.600
[Prince] We all get a thing,
right, when I do well?

34:28.633 --> 34:30.535
All the things.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.604
[scoffs]
That‘s the first time

34:32.637 --> 34:34.806
you‘ve ever said
anything like that.

34:34.839 --> 34:38.076
We‘re all grownups here now,
aren‘t we?

34:38.109 --> 34:40.145
So let‘s not
leave it unsaid.

34:40.178 --> 34:43.415
You‘re both billionaires,
or you will be

34:43.448 --> 34:45.650
partially because of all
the times I held my tongue

34:45.683 --> 34:47.619
and didn‘t tell someone
what I actually thought.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.488
You made more doing
the opposite.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.289
The gift you‘ve given us is,

34:51.322 --> 34:53.691
Have no fear about
speaking our minds.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.161
That‘s right.
Good.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.699
But, uh,

35:00.732 --> 35:03.034
sometimes, even though
we don‘t have

35:03.067 --> 35:05.203
the traditional
things to lose,

35:05.236 --> 35:06.404
we still have a lot to lose.

35:06.437 --> 35:09.608
What are you
asking her to do?

35:09.641 --> 35:11.443
Apologize.

35:11.476 --> 35:12.811
Tell the governor you
didn‘t mean it. Tell him--

35:12.844 --> 35:14.412
-Jesus Christ.
-Fuck that.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.914
Girls!

35:15.947 --> 35:18.282
I can‘t apologize for telling
the truth. I won‘t.

35:20.185 --> 35:22.186
Then your dad‘ll
never make you.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.324
I‘ll say I‘m sorry, too,

35:26.357 --> 35:28.527
for the way I handled
the business thing.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.195
I should have brought
you inside it.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.198
Still not going to do
what you want.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.003
Okay.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.604
I wish you would.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.206
But... okay.

35:43.908 --> 35:47.612
Will you at least start
answering my texts, then?

35:47.645 --> 35:50.649
We‘ll put you back
on the family thread.

35:50.682 --> 35:53.752
Oh, I-I‘m already on
the family thread.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.921
We might‘ve, um,

35:55.954 --> 35:58.857

Now, Mr. Bowen,

36:13.404 --> 36:15.440
as an expert witness,
you have testified

36:15.473 --> 36:18.210
that the goods from
Ocean‘s Plenty Wholesalers

36:18.243 --> 36:19.511
were not as claimed,

36:19.544 --> 36:22.447
but rather cheap,
garbage fish,

36:22.480 --> 36:24.816
mislabeled and pawned off
on an unwitting public.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.318
I‘m afraid so, yes.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.086
In my expert opinion.

36:28.119 --> 36:29.754
[Dave] I object.
Leading question.

36:29.787 --> 36:31.856
-[Judge Siegal] Overruled.
-[Dave] But, Judge--

36:31.889 --> 36:33.658
Ms. Mahar, didn‘t you see

36:33.691 --> 36:35.894
A Few Good Men
during law school?

36:35.927 --> 36:37.896
You‘re about to get the judge
to reaffirm my guy‘s an expert.

36:37.929 --> 36:41.266
Judge, I have something
to say about the bias--

36:41.299 --> 36:42.667
You‘ll have your chance

36:42.700 --> 36:44.369
to cross-examine
the expert witness.

36:44.402 --> 36:46.438
[Chuck] Ah! See that?

36:46.471 --> 36:48.206
And not only is he an expert,

36:48.239 --> 36:49.374
he‘s a scientist

36:49.407 --> 36:51.676
whose bias is the truth.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.279
Something your client
the conglomerate

36:54.312 --> 36:57.749
tried to hide
to rake in more profit.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.551
Ocean‘s Plenty

36:59.584 --> 37:01.586
trampled the rules
with abandon.

37:01.619 --> 37:04.522
Duped customers day after day,

37:04.555 --> 37:07.592

in largesse.

37:09.193 --> 37:11.262
No further questions.

37:13.264 --> 37:15.600
Your moment‘s
arrived, counsel.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.504
So, who paid you
to be here today?

37:19.537 --> 37:21.506
[Bowen]
The State of New York.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.275
They hired me to gather all
the evidence in this case.

37:23.308 --> 37:25.343
The State of New York.

37:25.376 --> 37:26.678
[Bowen] Just laying out
the truth for the State.

37:26.711 --> 37:29.914
Then, which do you prefer,
meat or fish?

37:29.947 --> 37:33.084
Or grain? Or dairy?

37:33.117 --> 37:35.787
Objection. Relevance.
We‘re not planning menus--

37:35.820 --> 37:38.323
If there‘s a point,
counsel, get to it fast.

37:38.356 --> 37:41.159
The point is bias.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.128
If he loves meat
and hates fish...

37:43.161 --> 37:45.096
it‘s hard to give a fishmonger
a break, isn‘t it?

37:45.129 --> 37:46.331
[laughs]

37:46.364 --> 37:48.599
[Bowen]
Sure, I like meat.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.169
I like fish too.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.637
I like grain, bread,
whatever.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.306
What does that
have to do with--

37:54.339 --> 37:56.841
Permission to
approach the witness.

37:58.309 --> 37:59.511
Recognize those?

37:59.544 --> 38:01.279
You‘re under oath here.

38:01.312 --> 38:02.681
-[Bowen] I‘m aware of that--
-Good,

38:02.714 --> 38:05.083
because if you are lying
about anything,

38:05.116 --> 38:06.885
it‘s a class-D felony.
There are grave penalties for--

38:06.918 --> 38:09.054
This is harassment,
if she doesn‘t have

38:09.087 --> 38:10.655
an actual line of inquiry--

38:10.688 --> 38:12.624
Protecting your witness
from perjury,

38:12.657 --> 38:14.392
I‘d say that‘s an actual--

38:14.425 --> 38:16.094
The witness knows
the penalty for perjury.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.997
He‘s not an idiot, and you‘re
not even making a defense.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.632
Since we understand

38:20.665 --> 38:22.934
the severe penalties
for perjury,

38:22.967 --> 38:24.302
for you and your wife.

38:24.335 --> 38:26.104
Those documents are
IRS Form 990s--

38:26.137 --> 38:28.339
Okay. All right.

38:29.807 --> 38:30.975
I‘m biased.

38:31.008 --> 38:33.845
For... whoever is paying.

38:33.878 --> 38:35.346
Yes.

38:40.685 --> 38:43.688
Enter defense exhibit
into evidence.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.992
Multiple payments
for $50,000

38:48.025 --> 38:49.661
made out to his wife,

38:49.694 --> 38:52.564
from big beef,
big poultry, big dairy,

38:52.597 --> 38:53.865
to hide the fact
that he‘ll say

38:53.898 --> 38:55.567
whatever his paymaster
wants him to.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.335
He‘s a paid gun for hire.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.571
Today it‘s for the state,
tomorrow,

38:59.604 --> 39:01.306
whoever‘s got the next check.

39:01.339 --> 39:05.443
Sir, you have the right not
to incriminate yourself further.

39:05.476 --> 39:08.612
That count as a defense to you?

39:21.893 --> 39:23.728
You outplayed me.

39:24.762 --> 39:26.564
Took a dirty
witness off the board

39:26.597 --> 39:29.501
so I‘d insist on having him.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.336
Till he tainted all my evidence.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.806
Like that lousy fish
you‘d never eat.

39:34.839 --> 39:38.510
You got that right.
Look at the bright side.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.912
You got to log a few
hours in a courtroom.

39:55.493 --> 39:57.128
Sorry for the drop-in.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.964
I‘ll clear my schedule.

39:59.997 --> 40:01.533
I need you to add to it.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.535
A call with Governor Sweeney.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.903
So I can apologize.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.473
What made you
change your mind?

40:08.506 --> 40:10.909
I mean, you knew it
would work on me.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.144
You‘re my fucking father.
And a good one.

40:13.177 --> 40:15.280
I curse like four times a year.
Why do you have to--

40:15.313 --> 40:17.915
I went to college
out of state.

40:19.016 --> 40:21.986
Just get the phone.
Let‘s call this guy.

40:25.823 --> 40:27.659
Call the governor‘s office,
tell him

40:27.692 --> 40:29.294
Gail wants to speak with him.

40:29.327 --> 40:30.862
You know what you want to say?

40:30.895 --> 40:32.863
Think it through,
don‘t freelance it.

40:34.799 --> 40:36.768
So,

40:36.801 --> 40:38.969
Mr. Sweeney-- Mr. Governor...

40:40.471 --> 40:43.507
about what I said the other...

40:45.076 --> 40:47.878
I‘m so sorry for what
I said the other...

40:51.249 --> 40:52.517
Mr. Governor,

40:52.550 --> 40:53.852
regardless of my feelings,

40:53.885 --> 40:55.920
out of respect for your office,

40:55.953 --> 40:58.189
what I said the other
night was wrong,

40:58.222 --> 40:59.924
and I am so sorry I--

40:59.957 --> 41:01.625
Forget it.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.164
You don‘t want me
to apologize?

41:06.197 --> 41:07.332
[hangs up]

41:07.365 --> 41:08.633
I do want you to apologize.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.802
I-I need you to, really.

41:10.835 --> 41:13.505
But, uh... I raised you
to speak your mind.

41:13.538 --> 41:16.207
-Fuck!
-[laughs]

41:16.240 --> 41:18.343
Five.

41:18.376 --> 41:20.511
[both laugh]

41:24.382 --> 41:26.150
[sighs]

41:26.183 --> 41:27.652
I‘ll tell you, Dad.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.153
I will never understand

41:29.186 --> 41:32.257
how a guy that
thin-skinned becomes governor.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.558

41:33.591 --> 41:35.326
Some kid gives him
a little crap,

41:35.359 --> 41:36.995
and he lets it shape policy?

41:37.028 --> 41:38.596
I mean...

41:38.629 --> 41:41.732
the vanity is just
so over the top.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.034
Good.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.871
Yeah.

41:46.904 --> 41:47.938
Real good.

41:49.540 --> 41:52.610
Terravore‘s still
tickling $66.00.

41:56.714 --> 41:58.182
This quarter‘s
gonna be a bloodbath.

41:58.215 --> 42:01.953
I‘m never gonna get
a sheet of my own.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.921
[sighs]

42:05.289 --> 42:06.824
Hang on.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.926
Russakoff has a new post...

42:10.061 --> 42:11.929
about Terravore.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.035
Mmm.

42:17.068 --> 42:19.870
Juicy, savory...

42:20.871 --> 42:23.974
nice patty tension,
good bite--

42:25.376 --> 42:27.045
this is a top pick,

42:27.078 --> 42:28.580
outperform!

42:28.613 --> 42:31.616
Thi-this is a must-buy
with leverage!

42:31.649 --> 42:33.051
Where the hell did
you get this from?

42:33.084 --> 42:35.787
It‘s Terravore.
100% vegan, plant-based.

42:35.820 --> 42:37.622
You‘re fucking kidding me.

42:37.655 --> 42:40.157
This is all
shoots and leaves?

42:42.126 --> 42:44.629
[Mafee]
Not the only way it‘s green.

42:44.662 --> 42:46.464
Mase Carb‘s
yay deep in this name.

42:46.497 --> 42:48.132
It‘s ready to hockey stick.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.736
[whispers] Nice, dude,
didn‘t even see you

42:51.769 --> 42:54.238
swap out the meat
for the vegan shit.

42:54.271 --> 42:56.774
I thought you were
gonna make the switch.

42:56.807 --> 42:59.777
[Russakoff] Raiders,

42:59.810 --> 43:03.448
Terravore is ready to pull

43:03.481 --> 43:05.216
a major stiffy!

43:05.249 --> 43:07.051
Ohh!

43:07.084 --> 43:10.788
[blows horn]

43:13.491 --> 43:15.226
Taylor.

43:15.259 --> 43:17.895
Stock‘s surging
on message boards and Robinhood.

43:17.928 --> 43:20.298
-The brosephs are biting!
-Taylor.

43:20.331 --> 43:22.934
And once momentum gets going
with the retail crowd--

43:22.967 --> 43:24.168
Taylor.

43:24.201 --> 43:26.738
So you keep saying.
We should be happy.

43:26.771 --> 43:30.774
We had to game it all out
from a burger review.

43:39.717 --> 43:42.286
They say the finest
bespoke tailors

43:42.319 --> 43:43.988
have "rock of eye."

43:44.021 --> 43:47.358
Can see beyond pattern
and chalk

43:47.391 --> 43:50.628
to take someone‘s true measure
by instinct, expertise.

43:50.661 --> 43:51.996
You think that‘s
how I beat you?

43:52.029 --> 43:53.865
No. It‘s how I see
beyond the woman

43:53.898 --> 43:57.135
who stood up for
an indefensible seafood scam

43:57.168 --> 43:59.671
to the better person
lurking beneath.

43:59.704 --> 44:01.039
I served my client.

44:01.072 --> 44:02.907
No higher calling
for a lawyer.

44:02.940 --> 44:04.008
But your
professional background,

44:04.041 --> 44:05.777
your choice of eatery,
tells me

44:05.810 --> 44:08.446
you‘re not meant
to cut vicuna cloth

44:08.479 --> 44:10.014
to pad your partners‘ paunches.

44:10.047 --> 44:11.949
You‘re meant to fit
the real villains

44:11.982 --> 44:13.985
for orange fucking jumpsuits.

44:14.018 --> 44:16.054
So you came here
to yell at me.

44:16.087 --> 44:17.755
I came here...

44:18.589 --> 44:21.325
to hire you.

44:21.358 --> 44:23.561
I did my 20 years as a PD

44:23.594 --> 44:26.464
helping people with nothing
get their actual day in court.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.366
I did.

44:28.399 --> 44:31.536
But eventually I wanted
to come home to a place I owned,

44:31.569 --> 44:34.038
not one I shared with a bank.

44:34.905 --> 44:36.541
So you went white shoe.

44:36.574 --> 44:37.909
It just became time
to get paid

44:37.942 --> 44:39.243
commensurate
with my abilities.

44:41.178 --> 44:42.747
Good.

44:42.780 --> 44:45.583
Good, now
we‘re talking worth.

44:45.616 --> 44:48.252
‘Cause those seven figures
may convince you of yours

44:48.285 --> 44:51.022
and it‘ll feel fucking great,
for a while.

44:51.055 --> 44:54.124
But it‘s a mirage
and you know it.

44:55.092 --> 44:57.729
The worth I can
offer is 200 times

44:57.762 --> 44:59.897
the ski house that beckons

44:59.930 --> 45:02.667
or the beach house
that follows that.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.203
There‘s a war going on,

45:05.236 --> 45:07.805
between the very wealth
you are trying to accrue

45:07.838 --> 45:11.041
and the rest of us.
The stakes are absolute.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.212
And we are under-armed
and under-manned,

45:14.245 --> 45:16.881
and you will be
the difference maker,

45:16.914 --> 45:20.084
which will make you
feel like yourself again.

45:20.117 --> 45:21.251
Finally.

45:35.933 --> 45:38.402
Good enough data to
divvy up the capital yet?

45:38.435 --> 45:40.271
Soon.

45:40.304 --> 45:42.573
Keep this going much longer,
they‘ll fuck the place up.

45:42.606 --> 45:44.142
Maybe.

45:44.175 --> 45:46.110
But this place
is also a platform

45:46.143 --> 45:49.080
for the bigger goals
we‘re chasing.

45:49.113 --> 45:51.582
Screw those up, might
as well not even be here.

45:51.615 --> 45:53.084
It all starts with the Games.

45:53.117 --> 45:55.286
Then we need to look
at ways to hit Sweeney,

45:55.319 --> 45:57.188
before he meets
with Rhoades tomorrow.

45:57.221 --> 46:00.291
Wags gave me a phone number
of a certain operative.

46:00.324 --> 46:03.127
Yeah, I don‘t think
an assassination,

46:03.160 --> 46:05.429
virtual or literal,
is the way to go here.

46:05.462 --> 46:07.899
No, I keep on thinking
about the vanity of a guy

46:07.932 --> 46:10.101
who would let a random
insult shape policy.

46:10.134 --> 46:11.702
Probably starts
every book he reads

46:11.735 --> 46:13.137
at the index,
under "Sweeney."

46:13.170 --> 46:15.439
[laughs]

46:15.472 --> 46:17.441
Where are we on the naming
rights for the stadium?

46:17.474 --> 46:19.644
We‘re taking offers.

46:19.677 --> 46:20.811
Bidding‘s robust.

46:22.279 --> 46:24.148
Let‘s stop.

46:24.181 --> 46:25.849
[scoffs]

46:29.386 --> 46:31.789
Russakoff‘s Raiders
pushed it to 75,

46:31.822 --> 46:32.924
and the market cap
tipped it over the edge.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.425
S&P 500 just announced.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.661
Terravore joins
the index in two weeks.

46:36.694 --> 46:37.995
Good. Sell the news.

46:38.028 --> 46:39.664
Blow it out, all of it.

46:39.697 --> 46:41.465
You‘re not selling
those calls.

46:41.498 --> 46:43.534
-Or a single share of the stock.
-We‘re in the money.

46:43.567 --> 46:45.269
If I don‘t sell now,
they‘ll be worth nothing.

46:45.302 --> 46:47.138
If you do sell,
it‘s manipulation.

46:47.171 --> 46:49.040
I‘m backing Spyros on this.

46:49.073 --> 46:50.308
You have a problem with it too?

46:50.341 --> 46:52.143
If an employee
courts prosecution,

46:52.176 --> 46:54.478
we‘re in HR territory,
so, yes.

46:54.511 --> 46:55.980
That won‘t be an issue.

46:56.013 --> 46:57.381
Legal‘s been in
on this from the start.

46:57.414 --> 46:58.382
I can paper this sale.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.153
What do you have
to support the buy?

47:02.186 --> 47:05.189
-My gut. My brain.
-That won‘t be good enough.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.298
What if it is a bump?

47:14.331 --> 47:16.334
And I want to be
the pinball fucking wizard,

47:16.367 --> 47:18.869
right up to the tilt line
without setting it off?

47:22.039 --> 47:23.307
Hmm.

47:24.575 --> 47:25.776
How long have you been vegan?

47:25.809 --> 47:27.244
Six and a half years.

47:29.313 --> 47:31.549
Well, that‘s six and a half
years of Instacart orders,

47:31.582 --> 47:34.085
Amazon deliveries,
web searches for vegan products

47:34.118 --> 47:36.220
that just became
due diligence.

47:36.253 --> 47:39.189
And it‘s all gonna go
in an analyst‘s report.

47:47.398 --> 47:49.267
[Sacker]
For six and a half years now,

47:49.300 --> 47:51.435
Taylor has been meticulously
researching Terravore

47:51.468 --> 47:53.937
and the entire sector.

47:54.905 --> 47:56.440
I‘ll hang onto that

47:56.473 --> 47:58.308
in case the SEC calls.

48:06.016 --> 48:09.353
You know what happened here.
On my watch.

48:09.386 --> 48:11.322
Under my nose.

48:11.355 --> 48:14.225
[Scooter] I know
what I think happened.

48:14.258 --> 48:17.027
I also know,
no one can prove it.

48:18.762 --> 48:21.899
Blow it out.
Sell all of it.

48:31.308 --> 48:33.010
This isn‘t what
we talked about.

48:33.043 --> 48:36.246
I‘m an attorney Wendy,
not a monk.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.282
Neither are you.

48:56.834 --> 48:59.236
You think I‘d be here
if I didn‘t look up to you?

48:59.269 --> 49:02.106
-You looked past me to Prince.
-He gets me.

49:02.139 --> 49:03.841
He thinks you‘re
his Rocking-Horse Winner.

49:03.874 --> 49:05.009
Yeah, well,
that guy never missed.

49:05.042 --> 49:06.110
Until it killed him.

49:06.143 --> 49:08.211
It‘s just an old story.

49:10.247 --> 49:13.551
I could have been a conductor,
you know. For real.

49:13.584 --> 49:15.820
Even at a young age,
I could hear when an orchestra

49:15.853 --> 49:17.221
was really firing.

49:17.254 --> 49:19.290
When the oboist was hungover

49:19.323 --> 49:23.094
or second chair violin
was getting over a heartache.

49:23.127 --> 49:24.295
Couldn‘t pay for a ticket,

49:24.328 --> 49:26.397
so I would go
when the Phil

49:26.430 --> 49:28.132
piped the music out
into Lincoln Center.

49:28.165 --> 49:30.500
Even though it was noisy
as hell outside...

49:32.603 --> 49:34.438
I could hear it all.

49:35.639 --> 49:38.642
But in the end, I chose money.
Simple as that.

49:38.675 --> 49:40.911
I met Prince, saw where
we could go together,

49:40.944 --> 49:42.680
walked away from it.

49:42.713 --> 49:44.148
So buy yourself an orchestra.
You can afford one now.

49:44.181 --> 49:46.083
Yeah, sure. But I won‘t,

49:46.116 --> 49:48.819
because I‘m a realist.

49:48.852 --> 49:51.555
What I‘m telling you is,

49:51.588 --> 49:55.292
Don‘t sell your private dreams
short for the more common one.

49:55.325 --> 49:56.994
What if they‘re
one and the same?

49:57.027 --> 49:58.629
Then you wouldn‘t have been
teaching in that charter school.

49:58.662 --> 50:00.898
You can be more than
a rich guy at a fund.

50:00.931 --> 50:02.700
You can be a founder,
an operator.

50:02.733 --> 50:06.337
-Change the world.
-I know, Senator Corleone.

50:06.370 --> 50:09.106
-Governor Corleone.
-Yes. Exactly.

50:10.507 --> 50:14.011
If you could only see
yourself through my eyes...

50:15.245 --> 50:17.848
you‘d know it‘s all possible.

50:17.881 --> 50:20.251
Ain‘t that the human condition.

50:20.284 --> 50:22.386
‘Cause all I want
is to be here.

50:22.419 --> 50:25.256
And I want you
to want me here, I do.

50:25.289 --> 50:28.625
But if you don‘t...
I‘ll be here anyway.

50:35.766 --> 50:37.567
My dad sold insurance.

50:38.669 --> 50:40.071
He always told me,

50:40.104 --> 50:42.406
"Control what you can,

50:42.439 --> 50:44.574
take out a policy on the rest."

50:46.143 --> 50:48.145
Get a load of that.

50:51.748 --> 50:55.152
The real version will be up
at the opening ceremony in ‘28.

50:56.186 --> 50:58.121
If you help me get there.

51:01.125 --> 51:02.692
Well, uh...

51:03.794 --> 51:05.196
why would I ever do that?

51:05.229 --> 51:07.598
Because legacies are tricky.

51:07.631 --> 51:09.266
You know, history
controls them, not us.

51:09.299 --> 51:11.102
Yeah, well, mine‘s
going to be tainted

51:11.135 --> 51:12.703
by what your daughter said.

51:12.736 --> 51:16.073
-Newspapers already wrote that--
-Newspapers.

51:16.106 --> 51:19.376
They call ‘em "history‘s
first rough draft" for a reason.

51:19.409 --> 51:21.212
Same reason the Irish
took ‘em into the jacks

51:21.245 --> 51:23.447
before toilet paper.

51:23.480 --> 51:26.217
That‘s why I‘m offering you
an insurance policy

51:26.250 --> 51:28.285
on your own history.

51:33.891 --> 51:36.293
Sweeney was supposed to be
here 30 minutes ago.

51:36.326 --> 51:37.761
Where the hell is he?

51:37.794 --> 51:39.162
The meeting‘s off.

51:40.564 --> 51:42.600
The governor‘s
throwing in with Prince.

51:42.633 --> 51:44.668
He‘s supporting
the New York Games.

51:44.701 --> 51:46.536
Jeez Louise.

51:53.310 --> 51:55.446
I took my own measure today.

51:55.479 --> 51:58.648
Rock of eye. And I‘m here
to get what I‘m worth.

52:05.889 --> 52:07.624
This woman, Judith...

52:08.559 --> 52:10.628
she was on
my bucket list since

52:10.661 --> 52:14.498
before either of us
had even remarried.

52:14.531 --> 52:17.134
Yet here you are at Chuck‘s,
not acting on it.

52:17.167 --> 52:19.970
Just waiting.

52:20.003 --> 52:23.140
And you‘re here to explain
why this restraint is good,

52:23.173 --> 52:25.609
why this is change.

52:25.642 --> 52:26.810
Nope.

52:26.843 --> 52:28.612
[chuckles]

52:28.645 --> 52:31.148
B.F. Skinner said
free will is an illusion;

52:31.181 --> 52:32.883
all we really have
is conditioning behavior

52:32.916 --> 52:34.418
and its consequences.

52:34.451 --> 52:37.354
And even the worst behavior,
followed by

52:37.387 --> 52:40.357
pleasant consequences,
is bound to be repeated.

52:41.625 --> 52:43.760
I‘ve thought about
that a lot this week.

52:45.062 --> 52:48.065
So... I need
to condition myself.

52:48.098 --> 52:50.534
For the good.

52:50.567 --> 52:52.269
No. It‘s why
you can‘t change.

52:53.804 --> 52:57.407
You‘ve only been rewarded
for bad behavior so...

52:58.775 --> 53:01.278
you need to stay
the hell away from Roxanne.

53:02.646 --> 53:03.680
Stay away?

53:05.682 --> 53:07.718
For her sake.

53:07.751 --> 53:11.989
‘Cause you‘re only gonna cheat
or fuck it up in some way.

53:12.022 --> 53:14.391
And she‘s only gonna suffer.

53:29.206 --> 53:31.875
He made up with her. He‘s
packing his bags to go home.

53:31.908 --> 53:33.210
[laughs]

53:33.243 --> 53:34.411
How‘d you do it?

53:34.444 --> 53:36.580
I urged him to stay away.

53:36.613 --> 53:38.115
Naturally.

53:38.148 --> 53:41.318
I knew you were
gonna come back.

53:41.351 --> 53:43.821
The week I‘ve had, I...

53:43.854 --> 53:45.923
I wanted to help
where I actually could.

53:45.956 --> 53:48.659
Oh, please. You owed me one
after poaching Sacker.

53:48.692 --> 53:51.828
-Not the way I saw it.
-Uh-huh.

53:53.030 --> 53:57.267
Thank you anyway,
for hauling him outta here.

54:19.623 --> 54:21.759
[sighs]

54:21.792 --> 54:25.763
Daniel, I need to cancel
our meeting tonight.

54:25.796 --> 54:28.999
I couldn‘t go the four days
without being transactional.

54:29.032 --> 54:31.601
I couldn‘t go four hours.

54:32.369 --> 54:34.505
I‘m gonna start over.

54:34.538 --> 54:36.339
Call you when I get there.

54:49.486 --> 54:51.522
Sometimes you cut
someone‘s minutes

54:51.555 --> 54:53.290
to remind them of their job.

54:53.323 --> 54:55.159
Sometimes you sit down a starter

54:55.192 --> 54:57.328
so they stand up stronger.

54:57.361 --> 54:59.396
Wooden. Again.

55:00.430 --> 55:03.500
Now, no one‘s being fired.

55:03.533 --> 55:06.937
This isn‘t Jack Welch‘s G.E.

55:06.970 --> 55:11.575
But too many of you were thrown
off your games too easily,

55:11.608 --> 55:13.744
so not all of you are
gonna keep their minutes.

55:13.777 --> 55:15.679
Victor, you‘ll keep
all of yours.

55:15.712 --> 55:17.481
You showed full exertion
and total focus,

55:17.514 --> 55:18.949
even in a petty squabble.

55:18.982 --> 55:21.051
But Philip‘s gonna
clean up your book,

55:21.084 --> 55:24.488
make it worthy of
the fund that bears my name.

55:24.521 --> 55:26.857
Thanks, Mike.
You won‘t regret it.

55:26.890 --> 55:29.893
Bonnie, I‘m cutting
your book in half.

55:29.926 --> 55:31.495
You traded against others
instead of for yourself,

55:31.528 --> 55:33.364
and your call was off.

55:33.397 --> 55:35.899
Wags‘ll approve all your trades
until I think you‘re ready.

55:41.772 --> 55:43.440
Fuck that.

55:45.776 --> 55:49.846
If I wanted team spirit, I would
work for fucking Chick-fil-A.

56:11.401 --> 56:12.902
[Tuk] Where‘s mine?

56:14.871 --> 56:17.875
Philip, I‘m doubling the book
you had at your old place.

56:17.908 --> 56:20.043
Thanks, Mike,
but I‘d like it to be halved.

56:20.076 --> 56:22.846
I‘ll grow my own book
if I can carve more profit.

56:22.879 --> 56:24.348
[Prince] Fine.

56:24.381 --> 56:25.749
Nice. I like it.

56:25.782 --> 56:27.785
We‘ll discuss terms privately.

56:27.818 --> 56:30.421
I fucking knew it!
You told me not to!

56:30.454 --> 56:31.622
I‘m so sorry.

56:31.655 --> 56:32.756
Tuk, I‘m zeroing you out.

56:32.789 --> 56:34.758
You‘ll service Philip for now.

56:34.791 --> 56:37.227
He‘ll teach you to trade
from fearlessness, not fear.

56:37.260 --> 56:38.929
Ben, I‘m boosting you 10%.

56:38.962 --> 56:42.099
Keep making the bold plays,
but unwind the protection.

56:42.132 --> 56:44.134
Lose the training wheels, man.
You don‘t need ‘em.

56:44.167 --> 56:46.870
Taylor Mason Carbon, you‘ll keep
your full allocation.

56:46.903 --> 56:49.940
I welcome your
new sense of... mission,

56:49.973 --> 56:52.475
as long as it never
conflicts with mine.

56:53.343 --> 56:54.978
Their shit worked.

56:55.011 --> 56:56.413
It worked, all right.

56:56.446 --> 56:57.948
Thirty million-plus
on that trade.

56:57.981 --> 57:02.019
Taylor went Milken
in ‘85, and it worked.

57:02.052 --> 57:03.554
Fucking rapacious.

57:03.587 --> 57:05.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
not so fast.

57:05.889 --> 57:08.425
I know this can be
an all-star team,

57:08.458 --> 57:10.360
but you can play
way above the rim.

57:10.393 --> 57:13.063
But you‘ll never get there
with blisters on your feet.

57:13.096 --> 57:16.366
That‘s why I keep hammering you
on the fundamentals.

57:16.399 --> 57:19.469
Position sizing,
focus, restraint.

57:21.838 --> 57:26.944
And, for all your moves,
for all your talent,

57:26.977 --> 57:28.645
it looks like Axe never
taught you how to put on

57:28.678 --> 57:30.047
your socks and your shoes.
