WEBVTT

00:03.836 --> 00:06.635
( No Audible Dialogue )

00:06.705 --> 00:08.640
Guess what.

00:08.708 --> 00:12.235
( Groans )
Nobody guess. It's always about boobs.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.780
Oh, come on. Don't you want
to know what I have to say?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.839
Man, I never know
what you have to say.

00:16.916 --> 00:18.907
I mean, in your head
you're speaking English...

00:18.985 --> 00:22.250
but when it comes out,
it's all buzzes and clicks.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.256
Oh, really?

00:24.324 --> 00:26.258
Well, I guess I was speaking
English to the S.A.T.'s...

00:26.326 --> 00:28.317
because I got 1 ,000 points.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.598
Oh, and last night on cable
I saw four boobs.

00:36.736 --> 00:38.727
Wait. So the S.A.T.'s are in?

00:38.805 --> 00:40.739
Donna, did you see
your scores yet?

00:40.807 --> 00:43.901
- Yeah. This morning. I got a 1 230.
- What?

00:43.977 --> 00:46.810
A 1 230? That's great.
Why didn't you say something?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.848
Well, I didn't want to brag.

00:48.915 --> 00:52.316
I mean, yeah, I kicked ass,
but it's no big deal.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.580
Eric. Eric, honey.

00:54.654 --> 00:58.090
I got the mail and your S.A.T.
envelope happened to be open...

00:58.158 --> 01:00.649
and the letter just sort of
slid into my hand...

01:00.727 --> 01:04.754
and I accidentally put on my
reading glasses, and I saw your score.

01:04.831 --> 01:07.265
You got an 800.

01:12.372 --> 01:14.966
I got an 800? That's it?

01:15.041 --> 01:17.009
''That's it?''

01:17.077 --> 01:21.980
If one hundred's an ''A,''
eight of them is an A-plus-plus.

01:22.048 --> 01:25.609
No. No, Mrs. Forman.
An 800's not good.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.449
I mean, a pigeon can peck
a better score than that.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.386
Really?

01:30.457 --> 01:32.516
Donna did better. Fez did too.

01:32.592 --> 01:36.323
And his whole country's
made of bamboo.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.092
This is awkward.
( Laughs )

01:39.165 --> 01:41.099
I'll just, um-

01:41.167 --> 01:43.931
I'll go home and take down the streamers.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.600
Forman, the S.A.T.'s prove nothing.

01:47.674 --> 01:51.303
I got a 950, and I don't
even have any textbooks.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.641
Or a locker.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.806
Wait, wait. A 950?

01:55.882 --> 01:58.783
Steven, I knew it.
You do have potential.

01:58.852 --> 02:02.219
Yeah. Imagine what I could do
if I only applied myself.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.855
Oh, well. Guess we'll never know.

02:05.925 --> 02:09.223
I just- I can't believe I got
the lowest score here.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.559
Oh, Eric, someone
had to come in last.

02:13.566 --> 02:16.433
There is no shame in that.

02:16.503 --> 02:19.301
Well, there is a little shame.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.533
Shame on you.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.100
- ( Chuckling )
- Hey.

02:25.178 --> 02:28.079
You know, who cares what
anyone got? It's just a stupid test.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.548
You know what?
You're right. I don't care.

02:30.617 --> 02:33.586
- I got a 1 030!
- ( Wails )

02:33.653 --> 02:37.316
- ( Sobbing )
- Yeah!

02:40.860 --> 02:43.454
I did good on a test, man.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.021
Something's happening to me.
I'm blooming like a flower.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.090
Whoo-hoo!

02:54.908 --> 02:58.275
So the S.A.T.'s proved it.
Donna's the smart one.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.312
Eric, on the other hand-

03:00.380 --> 03:02.371
Well, I don't wanna say
there's a dumb one...

03:02.448 --> 03:05.474
but there's two,
and he ain't the smart one.

03:05.552 --> 03:08.248
That's where you're wrong, Bob.

03:08.321 --> 03:12.985
Eric got an A-plus-plus.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.318
Oh, uh...

03:17.997 --> 03:20.659
no, see, uh, Red...

03:20.733 --> 03:23.258
it turns out
Eric still did very well.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.772
It's just, some other people did better.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.898
- Donna?
- Yes.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.910
- Steven?
- Yes.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.503
Not the foreign kid.

03:35.582 --> 03:38.176
Yes.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.185
Kelso?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.157
Yes.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.193
He did worse than Kelso?

03:49.028 --> 03:52.327
I watched that kid
glue his hand to his face.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.069
You.

03:58.137 --> 04:00.901
What happened on the S.A.T.'s?

04:00.974 --> 04:04.410
Okay, you know he's
not good under pressure.

04:04.477 --> 04:09.141
He can't pee in a public restroom
because there's an audience.

04:11.317 --> 04:14.377
You know what? This is a family thing.
I'll leave you to it.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.281
What's wrong with you?

04:18.358 --> 04:20.519
I don't know. Maybe I'm not smart.

04:20.593 --> 04:24.120
- Who says you're not smart?
- You.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.791
When?

04:26.866 --> 04:29.391
Always.

04:29.469 --> 04:32.666
Your problem is you got
your head up your ass.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.432
Your father's afraid
that you're spending...

04:37.510 --> 04:40.604
a little too much time
on a high school romance.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.672
That's right.
Donna gums up the works.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.275
Whoa. It's not her fault, okay?

04:46.352 --> 04:49.116
I was prepared for that test.
I had three sharp pencils.

04:49.188 --> 04:51.952
That's one more
than recommended, by the way.

04:52.025 --> 04:56.121
I remember sitting there,
filling out the little bubbles-

<i>( Tires Squealing )</i>

05:18.484 --> 05:21.851
- Well, that was a blast.
- Sure was.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.048
Now why don't you
point yourself toward my villa...

05:24.123 --> 05:26.114
and park this thing in my garage?

05:26.192 --> 05:29.958
Oh, I'm planning on that,
but what should I do with the car?

05:31.998 --> 05:34.933
We better hurry.
We only have five minutes.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.697
Well, that's four more
than I need, baby.

<i>( Woman )</i>
<i>I repeat: There's only five minutes left...</i>

05:45.278 --> 05:47.940

05:55.521 --> 05:57.489
Oh, my God.

05:57.557 --> 06:00.526
Donna <i>does</i> gum up the works.

06:00.593 --> 06:05.656
See? Now use what little brains
you've got and hit the books, dumb-ass.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.464
Kelso, what the hell
are you doing with a book?

06:13.539 --> 06:15.666
Reading.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.642
( Both Laugh )

06:18.978 --> 06:20.912
I am reading.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.278
'Cause what good is having brains
if you got nothing up here?

06:24.984 --> 06:26.975
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.385
So I saw my dad
in prison today.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.423
Oh. How was it?

06:31.491 --> 06:34.255
Well, at first it was a downer...

06:34.327 --> 06:36.522
but then I realized that
I'll be okay without my dad...

06:36.596 --> 06:41.192
because the S.A.T.'s prove that there's
another man who can take care of me.

06:42.468 --> 06:45.301
You better be talking
about Santa Claus.

06:45.371 --> 06:47.430
No, Steven, I'm talking about you.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.566
Because you have potential.

06:49.642 --> 06:53.669
He doesn't have potential.
I have potential.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.715
Like, I'm reading <i>Moby Dick,</i>
and I'm not even halfway through...

06:56.783 --> 06:58.944
and I can already
tell you the ending.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.680
The whale is a robot.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.893
Steven,just imagine
what your life would be like...

07:09.962 --> 07:12.726
with the love and support
of a good woman.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.859
( Chamber)

07:19.238 --> 07:22.639
Oh! Thank God for your strong S.A.T.'s.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.676
Now we don't have to be poor.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.406
Not poor, indeed.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.040
Basic math and verbal skills
are the ticket to great wealth...

07:30.116 --> 07:34.382
- and therefore great happiness.
- Oh.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.890
Poor person! Bring me a fancy cocktail.

07:40.159 --> 07:43.219
It is my privilege
to wait on you, madam.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.560
Oh, quite so, quite so.

07:45.631 --> 07:49.089
All right. Enough with
the idle chatter. Go be poor.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.101
Wait. Someone's playing
the harp in the corner?

07:57.176 --> 08:00.771
'Cause if I'm rich,
I'm hiring, like,Jethro Tull.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.777
Who cares?
It's the same thing every time-

08:05.852 --> 08:08.082
I'm a butler, I'm a bellhop,
I'm a stable boy.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.782
Well, I've had enough.

08:10.857 --> 08:14.725
I will not wait on
you people anymore. Got it?

08:16.963 --> 08:19.227
Good.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.766
Now who wants a Popsicle?

08:24.103 --> 08:27.072
Wow. Here's something I did not know.

08:27.139 --> 08:30.233
They number every page.

08:35.847 --> 08:39.147
Hey. You guys. You know how Red's always
telling me I need to buckle down?

08:39.217 --> 08:41.379
It turns out he's right.
I <i>do</i> have to buckle down.

08:41.453 --> 08:45.220
You sure do. He's got an 800.
There's your butler.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.587
Man, how can I ever marry Donna?

08:50.663 --> 08:54.099
I mean, I'm an idiot around her now,
and we're only engaged.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.227
( Together)
What?

09:00.006 --> 09:02.600
Oops.

09:02.675 --> 09:05.940
- You're engaged?
- ( Chuckling )

09:07.213 --> 09:09.204
No.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.308
How could you
give her that ring?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.717
You're in high school, man,
and according to the S.A.T.'s...

09:14.787 --> 09:17.483
that's about as far
as you're gonna go.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.921
Look.Just don't tell Donna
I told you, okay?

09:20.993 --> 09:23.427
She'd kill me.
It's supposed to be a secret.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.487
Of course she wants it a secret.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.898
''I'm marrying dumb guy.''
Who wants that spread around?

09:33.639 --> 09:36.403
You know, maybe Eric's
bad score is a blessing.

09:36.475 --> 09:39.467
It'll be a good story
when he's a senator.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.314
''Senator''?

09:43.382 --> 09:46.943
The word you're looking for is ''janitor.''

09:49.188 --> 09:51.122
Okay, see?

09:51.190 --> 09:53.249
That's why Eric did so poorly on that test.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.453
It's because you're too hard on him.

09:55.528 --> 09:59.555
I have to be hard on him,
'cause you always baby him.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.693
- Because you're so hard on him.
- You babied him before I was hard on him.

10:01.693 --> 10:03.957
- Because you're so hard on him.
- You babied him before I was hard on him.

10:04.029 --> 10:06.930
You were hard on him
when he <i>was</i> a baby.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.992
Hey, I just found out
I can take the S.A.T.'s again.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.402
I'm gonna- I'm gonna take it again,
and I'm gonna nail it.

10:14.473 --> 10:17.533
I just gotta buckle down.
I'm gonna kick a little S.A.T. butt.

10:17.609 --> 10:19.167
- Attaboy.
- Good for you.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.381
Think he'll do any better?

10:23.448 --> 10:25.678
- Eh.
- Yeah.

10:30.689 --> 10:33.089
Hi. What are you doing?

10:33.158 --> 10:36.787
Studying. I'd love to hang out,
but I've really gotta buckle down.

10:36.862 --> 10:38.796
All right. Can I raid the fridge?

10:38.864 --> 10:42.163
My dad wrote ''Save for Bob''
on all the food at our house.

10:57.216 --> 11:00.515
Oops. I dropped the margarine.

11:00.586 --> 11:02.781
Butterfingers.

11:05.157 --> 11:07.921
It's so slippery I can barely
get my fingers around it.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.725
( Sniffs )

11:15.801 --> 11:18.429
Uh, I gotta go.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.164
- Ground me.
- What?

11:23.242 --> 11:25.574
I am not strong enough.
If I'm gonna shake this Donna thing...

11:25.644 --> 11:27.805
I am gonna need
some serious discipline.

11:27.879 --> 11:29.813
Please ground me.

11:29.881 --> 11:32.315
You got it, pal.

11:32.384 --> 11:34.318
You're grounded.

11:34.386 --> 11:36.684
One more thing.
Donna's in the kitchen.

11:36.755 --> 11:39.815
- I need you to get rid of her for me.
- Do I have to be nice about it?

11:39.891 --> 11:43.486
- No.
- This is the happiest day of my life.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.133
Hey. Hey, Steven. Great news.

11:57.209 --> 11:59.143
I found a couple savings bonds...

11:59.211 --> 12:01.679
- and I can cash them in
to help you pay for college.
-Jackie-

12:01.747 --> 12:03.942
( Gasps )
You're going to college?

12:04.016 --> 12:06.246
I am so happy.
( Laughs )

12:06.318 --> 12:09.754
You were an orphan,
and we took you in. And now...

12:09.821 --> 12:12.221
look at you.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.088
I'm proud of you.

12:14.159 --> 12:16.593
And that money that you've
been paying in rent?

12:16.662 --> 12:19.096
I put it in a bank account for college.

12:19.164 --> 12:22.497
Or bail. But this is better.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.762
Okay, enough.

12:24.836 --> 12:27.430
Jackie, college is a waste of time,
and I'm not going, okay?

12:27.506 --> 12:29.997
- So just butt the hell out.
- No. No, Steven, I won't butt out...

12:30.075 --> 12:33.306
because you need to be pushed,
and we need to think about our future.

12:33.378 --> 12:36.279
Look. Even if we have a future,
it's not gonna be what you wanted.

12:36.348 --> 12:38.373
It's gonna be more like-

12:46.158 --> 12:49.127
Steven, do you think I'm fat?

12:49.194 --> 12:51.628
I know you're fat.

12:51.697 --> 12:53.688
Go get me a beer.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.034
( Grunts )

13:05.644 --> 13:08.772
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. It ain't pretty.

13:08.847 --> 13:11.577
( Groans )

13:11.650 --> 13:14.346
Please tell me they won't
be living in our basement.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.582
Well, we'll be dead by then.

13:17.656 --> 13:19.556
Oh, good.

13:26.832 --> 13:28.857
You grounded yourself?

13:31.136 --> 13:33.696
What? Why would I do that?

13:33.772 --> 13:36.502
Well, apparently, I ''gum up the works.''

13:38.176 --> 13:42.636
Oh, good. So someone filled you in.

13:42.714 --> 13:46.081
Yeah. Red-when he
kicked me out of your kitchen.

13:46.151 --> 13:48.142
And then he locked the sliding door...

13:48.220 --> 13:50.711
and stood there laughing and waving.

13:52.891 --> 13:56.156
Eric, why are you
freaking out about this test?

13:56.228 --> 13:59.129
I'm not. I'm gonna take it again,
and I'm gonna nail it.

13:59.197 --> 14:01.631
Anything less than a 1240
is unacceptable.

14:03.068 --> 14:05.229
A 1240? Hmm.

14:05.303 --> 14:07.737
That's 10 more points than I got.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.673
Really? That's weird.

14:10.742 --> 14:13.336
You're threatened because
I got a better score than you.

14:13.412 --> 14:15.903
- I just- I have to do better than you.
- Why?

14:15.981 --> 14:18.211
Because I'm the man,
and the man's the man...

14:18.283 --> 14:21.081
and that's just the way it is.

14:24.623 --> 14:26.557
What did you say?

14:26.625 --> 14:28.684
Uh-

14:28.760 --> 14:30.751
I'm grounded.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.161
Dad! Donna's up here.

14:40.772 --> 14:43.434
- That's it.
- What's it?

14:43.508 --> 14:45.635
This chapter just helped me
figure out the answer...

14:45.710 --> 14:49.612
to you and Donna's problem,
vis-a-vis your crappy score.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.876
''Vis-a-vis''?

14:51.950 --> 14:56.114
It's a PBS word, Eric.
Stay with me here.

14:56.188 --> 14:59.123
Yeah, I liken your situation
to that of Pavlov's dog.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.284
You see, Pavlov was this science guy...

15:01.359 --> 15:05.022
and every time his dog would
ring a bell, Pavlov would eat.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.404
Are you sure it was the dog
who rang the bell?

15:16.641 --> 15:19.201
Yeah. I mean, who else would it be?

15:19.277 --> 15:21.404
Pavlov?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.074
Well, that wouldn't be a trick, Eric.

15:24.149 --> 15:27.084
What man can't ring a bell?

15:27.152 --> 15:29.712
Anyway, every time that dog
would ring that bell...

15:29.788 --> 15:32.120
old Pavlov would eat,
and then he would drool.

15:36.828 --> 15:39.456
You just read that chapter
two seconds ago.

15:39.531 --> 15:41.965
- Do you even want my help?
- No!

15:42.033 --> 15:44.024
Your loss.

15:47.005 --> 15:50.304
Okay. So what's wrong
with you and Donna?

15:50.375 --> 15:52.343
She did better than me on that test...

15:52.410 --> 15:54.401
and I'm sorry, but that
is just not gonna fly...

15:54.479 --> 15:58.210
because I am the man and the man's
the man, and that's just the way it is.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.555
Well, honey, everybody
has different skills.

16:04.623 --> 16:07.217
I do better on tests
than your father...

16:07.292 --> 16:11.092
but he's the one brave
enough to kill spiders.

16:11.162 --> 16:14.063
And since we've been married,
how many tests have I taken? None.

16:14.132 --> 16:17.226
How many spiders
has your father killed?

16:17.302 --> 16:19.566
Hundreds.

16:21.239 --> 16:24.731
But, Mom, spiders freak me out.

16:28.380 --> 16:31.440
We all have different qualities.

16:31.516 --> 16:35.475
But the thing to remember
is how you do on some silly test...

16:35.554 --> 16:39.422
is much less important
than how you behave in real life.

16:39.491 --> 16:42.153
I'll take a dummy
over a jackass any day.

16:45.330 --> 16:48.766
So am I a dummy or a jackass?

16:48.833 --> 16:51.631
Well, honey, right now you're both.

16:53.505 --> 16:56.440
Okay, Steven, about
your vision of our future...

16:56.508 --> 16:58.976
with you swilling beer
and me being fat?

16:59.044 --> 17:02.411
That's not gonna happen,
because I'm not gonna be fat.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.505
It's genetic.

17:06.284 --> 17:08.343
That's true.

17:08.420 --> 17:10.411
Her mother drinks
two bottles of wine a day...

17:10.488 --> 17:12.979
and she looks damn good.

17:14.459 --> 17:17.326
No, I've seen her vacuum
in her underwear.

17:19.330 --> 17:23.597
- So what's your point?
- My point is she's frickin' hot.

17:27.906 --> 17:29.840
Not you.

17:29.908 --> 17:33.571
All I'm saying is that I've become
accustomed to a certain lifestyle...

17:33.645 --> 17:36.170
and if you would just
live up to your potential-

17:36.247 --> 17:39.273
I don't know why you're
talking to 950 guy over there.

17:40.986 --> 17:45.423
I got a 1 030. I got 80 more potential.

17:46.992 --> 17:49.426
Yeah, but Steven has my heart-

17:49.494 --> 17:51.485
Which is why I want him to be rich.

17:51.563 --> 17:55.260
I mean, think about all
the stuff you could buy for me.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.267
Jackie...

17:57.335 --> 18:00.930
why don't you earn your own money
and buy those things yourself?

18:02.607 --> 18:04.575
Myself?

18:06.645 --> 18:10.445
And I'm not like Forman. I have no
problem mooching off your success.

18:12.017 --> 18:15.214
You know, you leave the room,
I steal some money from your purse.

18:15.286 --> 18:18.278
You pretend I didn't,
but we both know I did.

18:19.691 --> 18:22.421
That's the future I see for us.

18:22.494 --> 18:25.258
Oh, Steven, that's beautiful.

18:26.965 --> 18:30.401
<i>Oh, wait. So you don't even care</i>
<i>that I did better than him?</i>

18:30.468 --> 18:32.299
Not really.

18:32.370 --> 18:35.533
Well, if being smart isn't gonna
help me impress the chicks...

18:35.607 --> 18:37.541
then I want no part of it.

18:39.611 --> 18:43.411
I'm gonna go back to coasting
through life on my good looks.

18:43.481 --> 18:45.506
Hey, and my brains will
always be there...

18:45.583 --> 18:47.574
so if I ever need 'em
I'll just whip 'em out...

18:47.652 --> 18:49.779
and use 'em like a secret
emergency rocket pack.

18:53.525 --> 18:55.891
That's a good plan, man.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.656
Hey, it beats the hell out of reading.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.929
- Okay, Donna, look.
- Don't worry, Eric.

19:06.004 --> 19:08.871
I'm only reading the funnies.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.341
Business section's
for the man, right?

19:12.410 --> 19:17.211
Donna, the thing is,
I'm a jackass and I know it.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.273
Well, I know it too.

19:19.350 --> 19:24.947
Look. Okay, the only reason
I said what I said is-

19:25.023 --> 19:28.390
You agreed to marry me
before the facts were in, right?

19:28.460 --> 19:32.123
So now I'm thinking
that maybe, you know...

19:32.197 --> 19:34.358
you might want to trade up.

19:36.367 --> 19:38.562
That's so stupid.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.935
Okay, I swear to God, if one
more person calls me stupid today-

19:42.006 --> 19:43.940
Eric-

19:46.644 --> 19:49.238
Eric, my entire life...

19:49.314 --> 19:51.646
everywhere I've gone
and everything I've done...

19:51.716 --> 19:54.241
has been better because
you were there with me...

19:54.319 --> 19:57.584
and no test score
is gonna change that.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.647
Wow.

20:00.725 --> 20:03.250
That was amazing.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.694
Did you come up
with that yourself?

20:07.365 --> 20:10.357
Well, I saw Mr. Ingalls say it to Mary
on <i>Little House on the Prairie.</i>

20:10.435 --> 20:14.565
- Hmm.
- I just made it a test score instead of blindness.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.865
But I- I still think it's true.

20:19.010 --> 20:22.741
So, you're still glad we're engaged?

20:22.814 --> 20:25.305
Of course.

20:25.383 --> 20:28.409
Good. Hey, speaking of <i>Little House</i>-

20:28.486 --> 20:30.920
Did you ever see that one where Laura...

20:30.989 --> 20:35.187
accidentally told Kelso, Hyde, Fez and
Jackie that she was engaged to Donna?

20:37.529 --> 20:40.123
Eric, are you kidding me?

20:40.198 --> 20:43.634
God. You can't even keep a secret?

20:43.701 --> 20:47.228
Hey, Donna, I got an 800.
We're lucky I can wash myself, okay?

20:57.215 --> 20:59.445
Poor person!
Where's my drink?

21:01.719 --> 21:04.415
Where's your drink?
What about my drink?

21:04.489 --> 21:07.458
Next time you ask where
your drink is, it will be in your ass.

21:16.267 --> 21:19.464
It's so hard to get good
poor people these days.
