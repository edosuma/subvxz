WEBVTT

01:06.483 --> 01:07.819
Whoa.

01:09.687 --> 01:10.555
Oh my God.

01:12.289 --> 01:13.490
It's beautiful.

01:14.626 --> 01:16.728
Oh this is just what
I need right now.

01:16.761 --> 01:19.797
And look at the
fucking coastline.

01:19.831 --> 01:21.833
Oh, I want it now.

01:21.866 --> 01:24.869
Well, it's available
this weekend.

01:26.638 --> 01:28.472
Oh, maybe that's why.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.375
Shit, is that per night?
Whoa.

01:34.979 --> 01:36.480
Fuck it.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.181
You need it.

01:39.751 --> 01:40.785
Yo.

01:40.818 --> 01:42.787
Oh hey.
Hi.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.287
Hey, sorry am I interrupting?

01:44.321 --> 01:46.390
No, to at all.
My baby.

01:46.423 --> 01:47.558
What's up bro?

01:47.592 --> 01:48.660
Hey, man nothing,

01:48.693 --> 01:51.194
I was just dropping off
someone in the neighborhood,

01:51.228 --> 01:53.631
thought I'd pop in, see
if you needed a ride home.

01:53.665 --> 01:55.600
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

01:55.633 --> 01:56.968
Yeah, we're just about finished.

01:57.001 --> 01:58.569
Does she request you on the app

01:58.603 --> 01:59.637
or can you go rogue?

01:59.671 --> 02:03.407
I think we'll get away
with it, this time, yeah.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.676
What you guys looking at?

02:04.709 --> 02:06.209
This house on the coast,

02:06.243 --> 02:07.177
we figured it might be fun

02:07.210 --> 02:08.045
if the four of us took
a trip this weekend,

02:08.079 --> 02:10.280
celebrate the closing
of seat funding.

02:10.312 --> 02:11.448
It's gonna be a
shit ton of work,

02:11.481 --> 02:13.651
so we figured it'll be nice
to take a little vacation

02:13.685 --> 02:14.686
before we start.

02:14.719 --> 02:16.253
Yeah, cool.

02:16.286 --> 02:17.755
I'm just gonna grab my jacket.

02:17.789 --> 02:18.656
Okay.

02:21.592 --> 02:23.326
Hey, I meant to text you,

02:23.360 --> 02:26.798
congratulations, it's
a really big deal.

02:26.831 --> 02:29.266
Thanks man.
Yeah.

02:29.299 --> 02:30.702
Okay, let's hit it.

02:30.735 --> 02:32.536
You all set?
Yeah.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.505
All right, I love you bro, bro.

02:35.539 --> 02:36.874
Love you more.

02:36.908 --> 02:38.475
Goodnight.

02:38.508 --> 02:39.509
Goodnight.

02:42.714 --> 02:44.015
I can't believe I'm
actually looking forward

02:44.048 --> 02:46.316
our a weekend away
with your brother.

02:46.349 --> 02:47.985
I'd pretty much given up on him

02:48.019 --> 02:50.287
but it really feels
like Mina woke him up.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.689
I don't know.

02:51.723 --> 02:53.658
He actually seems motivated,

02:53.691 --> 02:55.927
he's working, he's
back in school.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.029
I don't know if I'd
call two night classes,

02:58.062 --> 02:59.463
back in school.

03:00.397 --> 03:03.467
Well, she's definitely
a positive influence.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.871
Tell me how that
relationship has any legs.

03:06.904 --> 03:08.806
She's, you know, I mean.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.908
She's the whole package.
Right,

03:10.942 --> 03:12.342
and then you have my brother,

03:12.375 --> 03:15.312
he's a barely
employed Lyft driver,

03:15.345 --> 03:16.413
got kicked out of college,

03:16.446 --> 03:18.850
served jail time for nearly
beating a guy to death,

03:18.883 --> 03:20.551
outside of his frat house.

03:20.585 --> 03:23.788
I'm just saying, I've
never seen him like this.

03:23.821 --> 03:25.923
He really loves her, it's sweet.

03:25.957 --> 03:27.959
Yeah, of course he loves her,

03:27.992 --> 03:30.393
he hit the fucking jackpot.

03:33.998 --> 03:37.034
Oh yeah, it's a juicy one.

03:37.068 --> 03:38.569
Yeah, that's gross.
Look at that,

03:38.603 --> 03:39.436
you want it?

03:39.469 --> 03:40.270
No, I don't want it.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.072
It's yours.
well, I don't want that,

03:41.105 --> 03:41.939
it's yours now.

03:41.973 --> 03:43.841
Go on, keep it.
No.

03:50.114 --> 03:52.016
You didn't just do that.

03:52.049 --> 03:54.018
Let me see, let me
see your finger.

03:54.051 --> 03:55.753
It's on my finger still.
Let me see your finger,

03:55.787 --> 03:56.921
let me see it.

03:59.857 --> 04:02.059
You fucking kidding me.

04:02.093 --> 04:03.027
Hey.

04:03.060 --> 04:04.629
Dude, they said no pets.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.396
Just chill, it's gonna be fine.

04:06.429 --> 04:07.732
No, homeowners don't take

04:07.765 --> 04:09.466
this shit lightly dude,

04:09.499 --> 04:10.735
they'll turn us away.

04:11.736 --> 04:12.536
Oh yeah, it'll be hysterical

04:12.570 --> 04:14.005
when we drive across
the entire state

04:14.038 --> 04:15.006
and have to turn right round.

04:15.039 --> 04:15.973
[Josh] Look, we'll hide him

04:16.007 --> 04:18.108
until the owners
gone, all right.

04:18.142 --> 04:19.744
It's gonna be fine.

04:19.777 --> 04:20.611
Give him some love.

04:20.644 --> 04:21.745
What, no.
Give him a kiss.

04:21.779 --> 04:22.546
No.
You're gonna

04:22.580 --> 04:25.448
make him insecure
man, seriously.

04:26.383 --> 04:27.785
There it is.

04:27.819 --> 04:28.953
Good boy, Reg.

04:34.391 --> 04:36.761
This seems totally
normal, right?

04:36.794 --> 04:38.428
Yeah.

04:38.461 --> 04:40.131
Nothing that should
set off any red flags.

04:40.164 --> 04:44.467
Except, not everyone
is a racist prick.

04:44.501 --> 04:47.537
Mina, how many places
have you booked through?

04:47.572 --> 04:49.406
One.
Okay, well there you go.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.042
Yeah, but she got
a five star rating.

04:51.075 --> 04:53.911
How many places have we booked?

04:53.945 --> 04:54.745
Three.

04:55.646 --> 04:56.479
What?

04:56.513 --> 04:57.480
It's still more than one.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.017
Oh, come on, it's the
same house, same dates,

05:00.051 --> 05:01.118
her request gets denied

05:01.152 --> 05:03.754
and yours gets
accepted an hour later.

05:03.788 --> 05:05.522
Look, discrimination
obviously exists,

05:05.556 --> 05:06.991
and the name Mina Mohamadi,

05:07.024 --> 05:09.126
is about as Middle
Eastern, as it gets.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.962
I'm just saying,
why jump to that

05:10.995 --> 05:12.930
as the only possible
explanation.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.899
Yeah, no, you're right.

05:14.932 --> 05:16.734
We should probably give, this
white guy we've never met,

05:16.767 --> 05:17.702
the benefit of the doubt.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.103
Give everybody the
benefit of the doubt,

05:19.136 --> 05:20.037
is what I'm saying.

05:20.071 --> 05:22.907
Yeah, no, that's groovy man,

05:22.940 --> 05:23.975
peace and love.

06:03.681 --> 06:04.815
Shit, are we here?

06:04.849 --> 06:06.984
Looks like it.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.954
Will you hide your dog.

06:11.055 --> 06:12.890
You realize, if he
barks, we are fucked.

06:12.924 --> 06:15.126
He won't make a peak.

06:37.915 --> 06:39.650
Not bad.
So nice.

06:42.186 --> 06:43.721
He's gotta be around
here somewhere.

06:43.754 --> 06:44.622
Hello.

06:58.269 --> 06:59.937
Whoa.
Holy shit.

07:01.205 --> 07:02.940
Oh, yeah, this will do.

07:03.641 --> 07:05.176
Do you have the guys number?

07:05.209 --> 07:06.210
Yes, here.

07:14.018 --> 07:15.619
Oh, hey.

07:15.653 --> 07:17.188
Y'all just decided to
let yourselves in, hah?

07:17.221 --> 07:18.189
Sorry, I was just
trying to call you.

07:19.724 --> 07:21.659
Yeah, I expected
you an hour ago.

07:21.692 --> 07:22.660
Is everything okay?

07:22.693 --> 07:24.695
Yeah, we just, we got
a bit of a late start

07:24.729 --> 07:26.597
and then stopped for groceries.

07:26.630 --> 07:28.032
You must be Taylor, I'm Charlie.

07:28.065 --> 07:29.100
Yeah, that's me.

07:29.133 --> 07:30.935
You own this place?

07:31.869 --> 07:33.738
Why do you gotta
say it like that?

07:33.771 --> 07:36.040
Oh, I didn't mean
anything by it.

07:36.073 --> 07:37.842
Yeah, it's my brothers spot,

07:37.875 --> 07:39.043
I just take care of it,

07:39.076 --> 07:40.244
he's down in the Bay area,

07:40.277 --> 07:42.046
he never uses it.

07:42.079 --> 07:43.214
Well, we're hopefully on our way

07:43.247 --> 07:47.118
to owning a second
home, we never use, too.

07:47.151 --> 07:49.053
This is my wife Michelle,

07:49.086 --> 07:50.588
that's my brother Josh

07:50.621 --> 07:51.756
and my partner Mina,

07:51.789 --> 07:55.292
my work partner, also happens
to be Josh's girlfriend.

07:55.326 --> 07:58.929
How'd you get mixed
up with this family?

08:02.099 --> 08:03.868
What do you mean?

08:03.901 --> 08:06.704
Oh, no, I didn't
mean anything by it.

08:06.737 --> 08:10.207
Come on, let me show
you rest of the house.

08:12.943 --> 08:15.946
Wow, this piece of shit,

08:15.980 --> 08:18.749
somehow exceeded
my expectations.

08:18.783 --> 08:21.585
Yeah, no that's, fucking weird.

08:22.319 --> 08:25.589
Can't believe we're
giving this guy our money.

08:25.623 --> 08:27.758
- Babe.
- What?

08:27.925 --> 08:30.828
Let's just, look
we already drove,

08:30.861 --> 08:32.263
all the way out here all right,

08:32.296 --> 08:34.065
let's just enjoy ourselves,

08:34.097 --> 08:35.732
spend some time together

08:35.765 --> 08:38.102
and be outta here soon, okay.

08:50.815 --> 08:52.283
All right, set to
blank, turn that thing

08:52.316 --> 08:53.217
and let me show you.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.852
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

08:54.885 --> 08:56.053
Let me show you out back

08:56.087 --> 08:58.222
and then I'll get
outta your hair.

08:58.255 --> 08:59.924
Great.

09:03.127 --> 09:05.029
Wow, it's beautiful.

09:07.231 --> 09:09.967
Yeah, that's the thing, ocean.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.970
The hot tub's over here.

09:16.674 --> 09:18.676
Instructions are on the side.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.845
There's a bathroom
through that door,

09:20.878 --> 09:22.213
on the corner there,

09:22.246 --> 09:24.248
towels, everything you need.

09:24.281 --> 09:26.350
- Oh nice.
- Great.

09:26.383 --> 09:29.420
Yeah, it's nice
getting in after dark,

09:29.453 --> 09:32.389
the stars are insane out here.

09:32.423 --> 09:34.825
Damn, I shoulda
brought the telescope.

09:34.859 --> 09:37.194
I thought about it
and I totally forgot.

09:37.228 --> 09:40.164
What do you need a
telescope in the city for?

09:40.197 --> 09:44.135
Unless you're like a
peeping tom or something.

09:48.706 --> 09:49.473
I got one you can borrow.

09:49.507 --> 09:50.808
If you promise to
treat it right,

09:50.841 --> 09:52.376
I'll bring it on over.

09:52.409 --> 09:54.411
Oh, that's all right, I
don't wanna put you out.

09:54.445 --> 09:56.213
No, that's no problem.

09:56.247 --> 09:59.216
I shoulda had one here already.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.718
That's my fault.

10:06.157 --> 10:08.459
All right then, I'll
let you get to it.

10:08.492 --> 10:10.361
There's a welcome pack
in the loft upstairs,

10:10.394 --> 10:13.330
you got my phone
number, wifi info such,

10:13.364 --> 10:14.398
I'm just up the road,

10:14.431 --> 10:16.267
if you need anything.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.770
Otherwise, follow the check
out procedures, when you go,

10:19.803 --> 10:22.806
and have a good,
have a good weekend.

10:22.840 --> 10:23.507
All right.
Thanks.

10:23.541 --> 10:24.742
Really appreciate it, thank you.

10:24.775 --> 10:25.843
All right.
Hey dude,

10:25.876 --> 10:29.980
are you the one who does
the bookings for this place?

10:31.415 --> 10:32.917
Yeah, I book this place.

10:32.950 --> 10:34.051
I tried to rent this house,

10:34.084 --> 10:35.452
for this exact period of time,

10:35.486 --> 10:36.921
but my request was denied,

10:36.954 --> 10:38.822
can you tell me why that is?

10:38.856 --> 10:41.325
I don't know, a lot of people
try to rent this place,

10:41.358 --> 10:43.894
I don't remember your request.
Yeah, babe.

10:43.928 --> 10:44.795
It's just a little strange,

10:44.828 --> 10:46.397
'cause my request was denied

10:46.430 --> 10:47.798
but then Charlie, a white man,

10:47.831 --> 10:49.366
put in an identical request,

10:49.400 --> 10:51.202
an hour later and
his was accepted.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.070
We really don't have to
get into this, right now.

10:53.103 --> 10:56.173
Mina Mohamadi, do
you remember now?

10:58.842 --> 10:59.977
If you don't like the house,

11:00.010 --> 11:01.111
or have any other problems,

11:01.145 --> 11:05.883
cancellation policy is listed
clearly on the website.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.986
Outside of that, I
don't have anything else

11:09.019 --> 11:10.754
to discuss with you.

11:13.424 --> 11:15.826
We understand, thank you.

11:17.861 --> 11:19.196
Asshole.
Hey.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.770
Wanna help me put
away the groceries?

11:26.804 --> 11:27.471
Yeah.

12:07.211 --> 12:08.245
It's a beautiful home,

12:08.279 --> 12:09.413
hah, bro, bro?

12:10.582 --> 12:13.517
Crack a bruskey or twosky,

12:13.551 --> 12:15.786
gaze up at brorians belt.

12:17.488 --> 12:19.823
Sip a little Pinot gris,

12:20.524 --> 12:23.027
pop in a bromantic comedy.

12:23.060 --> 12:26.263
Oh, Broseph Gordon-Levitt
all day, all night.

12:26.297 --> 12:28.499
Smoke a J, take a long walk

12:28.532 --> 12:30.367
along the brocean.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.369
Yeah, get that sand
between your broes.

12:32.403 --> 12:33.470
Prefect brome away from brome.

12:34.371 --> 12:36.240
Okay, that's enough.

12:38.442 --> 12:40.010
A walk does sound nice though.

12:40.044 --> 12:40.911
I wasn't kidding about that.

12:40.944 --> 12:41.812
After we put the stuff away,

12:41.845 --> 12:43.480
you guys wanna check
out the property?

12:43.514 --> 12:45.249
Abs-bro-lutely.

12:45.282 --> 12:48.620
Oh shit, Michelle,
from way down town.

12:51.021 --> 12:51.889
Come on.

13:51.949 --> 13:52.617
Shit.

13:54.284 --> 13:55.119
Come on.

13:56.019 --> 13:56.887
Come on.

14:43.066 --> 14:44.968
What you doing boy?
Jesus.

14:45.002 --> 14:46.336
God, that was good.

14:46.370 --> 14:47.504
What the fuck?

14:48.606 --> 14:53.076
Creepy door with an
electronic code, that's great.

14:59.283 --> 15:01.218
Would have been extra
creepy if that worked.

15:01.251 --> 15:02.486
So dumb.

15:02.519 --> 15:05.657
Come on, they're waiting.
All right.

15:15.299 --> 15:17.234
They can be kind
of intense, right.

15:17.267 --> 15:19.036
Yeah.

15:19.069 --> 15:22.172
Don't worry, it gets less weird.

15:22.206 --> 15:24.074
That's comforting.

15:31.315 --> 15:35.452
I'm constantly terrified,
she's gonna leave me.

15:35.486 --> 15:37.555
Why would you say that?

15:39.156 --> 15:42.159
She's just so fucking smart

15:42.192 --> 15:43.595
and talented.

15:43.628 --> 15:46.564
And, you know, I just
wanna be better for her

15:46.598 --> 15:51.168
and I wanna be able to
challenge and inspire her

15:51.201 --> 15:55.539
but, I feel like, she doesn't
even need that from me,

15:56.808 --> 16:00.010
she's already
fulfilled in that way.

16:00.678 --> 16:01.779
Makes any sense?

16:01.813 --> 16:03.480
Yeah, absolutely.

16:04.749 --> 16:07.484
Trust me, I hear
everything you're saying

16:07.518 --> 16:10.688
and I think, what
she needs from you

16:10.722 --> 16:14.358
is not for you to
occupy the same space

16:14.391 --> 16:16.493
as her work partner,

16:16.527 --> 16:18.529
that's all he is to her.

16:19.764 --> 16:20.598
And I just think,

16:20.632 --> 16:23.367
you need to be loving
and supportive,

16:23.400 --> 16:26.270
goes a lot further
than you think.

16:26.303 --> 16:28.205
All right, so, you're cool

16:28.238 --> 16:30.340
with her occupying
such a huge space

16:30.374 --> 16:32.442
in your husband's life?

16:32.476 --> 16:35.078
I mean, no, fuck her.

16:35.112 --> 16:36.446
But yeah, yeah,

16:36.480 --> 16:39.483
they just have their
creative thing going on.

16:39.516 --> 16:43.186
I'm glad he has someone
to share that with.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.827
- Hey.
- I'm freezing.

16:49.861 --> 16:52.564
You guys ready to turn back?

16:52.597 --> 16:53.731
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:00.370 --> 17:01.606
Chilly.

17:17.855 --> 17:21.290
Whoa, look what we have here.

17:21.325 --> 17:23.527
Someones trying to get
a five star rating.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.428
Oh, ooh.

17:26.530 --> 17:28.464
All right, I know we
don't like the guy

17:28.498 --> 17:30.768
but I'm glad that we have
this for the weekend.

17:30.802 --> 17:31.669
Yeah.

17:34.271 --> 17:35.505
So, are you really
just accepting

17:35.539 --> 17:38.375
that he's gonna come
and go as he pleases?

17:38.408 --> 17:40.912
Well, you know, he did say,

17:40.945 --> 17:43.815
he was gonna drop
it off, tonight.

17:45.315 --> 17:49.152
Couldn't leave it
on the front porch?

17:49.186 --> 17:52.389
You guys don't find
this creepy at all?

17:56.828 --> 17:57.929
Sorry.

17:57.962 --> 17:59.831
Done talking about it.

18:01.264 --> 18:03.200
Let's have a good time.

18:04.468 --> 18:05.502
Who wants a drink?

18:05.535 --> 18:06.771
Yes.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.849
This looks incredible.

18:17.882 --> 18:19.216
Yeah, it's beautiful.

18:19.249 --> 18:20.384
So, what?

18:20.417 --> 18:21.919
We'll just like head out,
first thing in the morning?

18:21.953 --> 18:23.487
Yeah, it'll take
at least two hours

18:23.520 --> 18:25.422
to get to the waterfall.

18:25.455 --> 18:27.457
Charlie's been making fun of me

18:27.491 --> 18:29.226
for buying a hydration pack

18:29.259 --> 18:30.595
just for this hike.

18:30.628 --> 18:32.195
It is the nerdiest
thing I've ever seen

18:32.229 --> 18:34.599
but I love you and I
love that you plan ahead.

18:34.632 --> 18:35.900
I get excited.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.737
So, what about tonight?

18:39.771 --> 18:41.673
I mean, I don't know what
kind of vibe we're going for

18:41.706 --> 18:46.376
but, Michelle, don't you have
a little surprise for us?

18:47.879 --> 18:49.212
Tonight?

18:49.246 --> 18:52.249
I was kinda thinking
tomorrow maybe.

18:53.483 --> 18:55.586
Just, let's just show them.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.287
- Just get it.
- Okay.

18:58.589 --> 19:00.424
What's going on?

19:00.457 --> 19:02.259
What are you guys up to?

19:02.292 --> 19:04.929
I don't know what's going on.

19:04.962 --> 19:07.932
What are you up to?

19:07.965 --> 19:10.233
Sneaky Michelle.

19:13.336 --> 19:14.237
What?

19:16.741 --> 19:17.608
Oh my God.

19:18.810 --> 19:20.410
Oh my God, I don't
think I've done this

19:20.444 --> 19:21.612
since the night we met.

19:21.646 --> 19:23.246
Where did you even get this?

19:23.280 --> 19:24.782
Mina, he's told you the
story of how we met, right?

19:24.816 --> 19:26.651
Yeah, of course, I've
been hearing for years

19:26.684 --> 19:29.854
that you just get a little
ecstasy in this guy,

19:29.887 --> 19:31.521
turns into a dancing queen.

19:32.355 --> 19:32.990
There are pictures
from that night

19:33.024 --> 19:33.958
where it just looks like,

19:33.991 --> 19:37.862
we're full on fucking
on the dance floor.

19:37.895 --> 19:40.430
So, shall we do some drugs?

19:43.768 --> 19:46.838
Shit, you guys, I really
don't wanna be a downer

19:46.871 --> 19:49.574
but I might bow out early.

19:49.607 --> 19:52.710
It just, it was a long
shitty week at work

19:52.744 --> 19:55.947
and I'm sadly fading kinda fast.

19:55.980 --> 19:58.716
Okay, well, you know,
if you're not into it,

19:58.750 --> 20:00.685
we don't have to do
it tonight, right?

20:00.718 --> 20:01.886
Yeah.
Oh my God, no, no, no,

20:01.919 --> 20:03.286
please do it, I'm just,

20:03.320 --> 20:05.056
I know if I keep going,

20:05.089 --> 20:07.792
there's no chance I'm alive
for this hike tomorrow.

20:07.825 --> 20:09.794
Just save enough so we can all

20:09.827 --> 20:13.330
get sufficiently fucked
up tomorrow night.

20:13.363 --> 20:14.565
Yeah, just like a little bit.

20:14.599 --> 20:15.733
Yeah.
A little bit.

20:15.767 --> 20:17.334
A little bit.
A little bit.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.395
All right, let's go, I got ya.

20:45.428 --> 20:49.000
Tap out, tap out.
Josh, that's enough.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.568
Tap out.

20:51.501 --> 20:52.502
Yes, winner.

20:54.105 --> 20:54.972
Yes.

21:23.134 --> 21:24.669
Because of the earth's rotation,

21:24.702 --> 21:26.369
if it had hit a minute later,

21:26.403 --> 21:27.404
it would've landed in the sea

21:27.437 --> 21:31.441
and dinosaurs would still
be ruling our earth.

21:37.414 --> 21:38.583
Do you think cave people

21:38.616 --> 21:40.685
were afraid of asteroids?

21:43.888 --> 21:45.656
Are you saying that 'cause
you think cave people

21:45.690 --> 21:48.025
and dinosaurs lived together?

21:49.459 --> 21:52.529
Oh no, I mean, I know
there was, you know,

21:52.563 --> 21:54.565
a time after dinosaurs
before people.

21:54.599 --> 21:56.000
How long between
dinosaurs going,

21:56.033 --> 21:57.434
and homo sapiens.
You always do that,

21:57.467 --> 21:58.135
I'm not taking your quiz.

21:58.169 --> 21:59.436
No, come on bro, take a guess.

21:59.469 --> 22:00.671
Fuck you.
65 million years.

22:00.705 --> 22:01.973
Good, you win.

22:10.681 --> 22:12.783
I'm getting another,
you want anything?

22:12.817 --> 22:13.985
I'm fine baby, thank you.

22:14.018 --> 22:15.518
You're good?
Yeah.

22:15.553 --> 22:17.054
What about you Reg

22:17.088 --> 22:18.689
you want anything?

22:24.161 --> 22:26.898
You wanna take a look?
Yeah.

22:37.041 --> 22:38.643
What are you doing?

22:38.676 --> 22:41.544
Being one of those
big city peeping toms,

22:41.579 --> 22:43.648
people are always talking about.

22:45.650 --> 22:47.652
You see anything?

22:47.685 --> 22:50.420
One house with it's lights on.

22:51.923 --> 22:52.790
Oh yeah.

22:55.492 --> 22:57.028
Are people doing it?

22:59.230 --> 23:00.564
Oh shit.

23:00.598 --> 23:02.033
What?
Somebody was watching,

23:02.066 --> 23:03.634
looking right back at us.

23:03.668 --> 23:04.501
What?

23:04.534 --> 23:05.169
No.

23:05.202 --> 23:07.939
I'm dead serious, look.

23:10.107 --> 23:13.844
Oh my God, is that Taylor?

23:13.878 --> 23:15.146
Okay, the bid is over.

23:15.179 --> 23:16.013
What the fuck is he doing?

23:16.047 --> 23:17.214
- Shut up.
- No, I'm serious,

23:17.248 --> 23:18.816
he's got the fuck, fuck.

23:19.717 --> 23:21.152
Fuck you.

23:21.185 --> 23:24.521
Never attempt to
outplay the player.

23:30.127 --> 23:32.730
So glad we did this.

23:32.763 --> 23:34.231
Me too.

23:35.199 --> 23:37.802
It's gonna be a fun year right.

23:37.835 --> 23:39.270
Yeah.

23:39.303 --> 23:42.606
We finally fucking
did it, it's crazy.

23:53.017 --> 23:55.219
I'm gonna go check on Josh.

24:06.564 --> 24:07.231
Oh, hey.

24:10.034 --> 24:10.868
Come back out.

24:10.901 --> 24:12.036
Hey baby.

24:12.069 --> 24:13.771
Don't be in here alone.

24:13.804 --> 24:15.206
It's so comfortable.

24:15.239 --> 24:18.676
No, come on, this
is our vacation.

24:18.709 --> 24:20.244
We never get to
hang out like this.

24:20.277 --> 24:21.112
I know baby,

24:21.145 --> 24:23.681
I'm coming, I'm coming.

24:23.714 --> 24:25.049
I'm coming.

24:25.082 --> 24:28.252
Why'd you have to drink so much?

24:28.285 --> 24:30.154
Told you to slow down.

24:44.235 --> 24:45.836
Everything okay?

24:47.071 --> 24:48.538
He's like out.

24:50.207 --> 24:52.009
Well, I don't know about you

24:52.043 --> 24:55.246
but I am getting
in this hot tub.

24:55.279 --> 24:58.315
Oh no, I'm like annoyed now.

24:58.349 --> 25:02.753
I just, yeah, maybe I do
wanna get in this hot tub.

25:05.656 --> 25:07.958
I'm getting my suit and
I'll meet you back here.

25:07.992 --> 25:08.859
Okay.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.981
Hydrate.

25:31.015 --> 25:32.349
Hydrate, hydrate.

25:34.118 --> 25:34.952
How is it?

25:34.985 --> 25:36.720
Oh my God, get in.

25:40.224 --> 25:41.092
Oh fuck.

25:42.293 --> 25:43.160
Right?

25:47.164 --> 25:49.166
With the fog rolling in.

25:50.768 --> 25:51.635
So nice.

25:52.803 --> 25:55.206
You know what's really nice?

25:57.808 --> 25:59.677
These jets on my back.

26:01.145 --> 26:02.279
I want jets.

26:03.781 --> 26:05.049
Let me get some.

26:06.016 --> 26:06.884
Trade me.

26:18.028 --> 26:19.697
Oh, this is unreal.

26:23.234 --> 26:25.302
Can I tell you something?

26:25.336 --> 26:29.807
You're getting us a
hot tub for the office?

26:31.342 --> 26:33.744
I think you're brilliant.

26:35.379 --> 26:36.313
Thank you.

26:36.347 --> 26:40.417
You just make me so
much better at what I do

26:43.187 --> 26:45.256
and you're funny and kind

26:47.892 --> 26:49.193
and you're just fucking great,

26:49.226 --> 26:51.095
and I'm just so
happy to know you

26:51.128 --> 26:52.730
and work with you.

26:55.799 --> 26:57.401
If you're gonna get
all lovey-dovey,

26:57.434 --> 27:00.037
I feel the same way about you.

27:01.972 --> 27:05.209
I feel like we have
a real partnership,

27:05.242 --> 27:08.913
which I honestly didn't
think was possible.

27:10.281 --> 27:13.384
I always feel like
people let me down.

27:14.885 --> 27:18.822
You just keep, not letting
me down, it's weird.

27:22.293 --> 27:23.160
Cheers.

27:25.062 --> 27:26.330
Cheers.

27:30.367 --> 27:31.735
Now, give me those jets back.

27:31.769 --> 27:32.403
No.

27:34.338 --> 27:35.839
Share the jets?

27:35.873 --> 27:37.208
Share the jets.

27:43.981 --> 27:45.182
You getting some?

27:45.216 --> 27:46.083
Yep.

28:22.453 --> 28:23.320
Reggie.

28:25.289 --> 28:26.824
Reggie come here.

28:35.199 --> 28:36.033
Whoa.

28:36.066 --> 28:38.135
What the hell was that?

28:39.403 --> 28:40.804
I don't know.

28:42.273 --> 28:45.809
Maybe Reggie has the right idea,

28:45.843 --> 28:47.311
maybe time for bed.

29:04.629 --> 29:06.230
Goodnight Charlie.

30:44.495 --> 30:46.463
The dancing queen lives.

30:46.497 --> 30:47.431
Oh, barely.

30:47.464 --> 30:49.266
You have fun?

30:49.299 --> 30:50.568
Well, come on, we gotta go,

30:50.602 --> 30:52.236
I don't wanna get stuck
out there, in the dark,

30:52.269 --> 30:53.605
on the hike back.

31:02.446 --> 31:03.681
Are you going?

31:05.449 --> 31:08.051
Sitting here, trying to decide.

31:08.085 --> 31:10.387
Come on, finish
eating, let's go.

31:10.421 --> 31:15.426
I'm so tired, I don't
think I'll be much fun.

31:15.693 --> 31:17.027
Okay.
What?

31:20.565 --> 31:21.599
Nothing, it's just,

31:21.633 --> 31:24.501
you know, I don't remember
much from last night,

31:24.535 --> 31:26.437
but I do kind of recall,

31:26.470 --> 31:28.472
someone giving me shit

31:28.505 --> 31:32.342
about missing out on
fun vacation times.

31:32.376 --> 31:34.344
You know, something about

31:34.378 --> 31:38.583
how we never get to
hang out this way, or.

31:38.616 --> 31:40.017
Call it even?

31:41.218 --> 31:43.086
You know, I don't have to go,

31:43.120 --> 31:45.189
I can stay here with you.

31:47.124 --> 31:49.059
Can't ditch Michelle,

31:50.260 --> 31:52.262
look how excited she is.

31:57.167 --> 32:01.104
Well, Charlie and her
can have their own day.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.476
Don't think that's happening.

32:06.477 --> 32:07.779
I guess, I'm kinda stuck
with this one, aren't I?

32:07.812 --> 32:11.616
I'm sorry, I'll make
it up to you, promise.

32:13.818 --> 32:17.521
Can have a really fun
night when you get back.

32:17.555 --> 32:19.089
All right.

32:19.122 --> 32:20.692
I love you.

32:20.725 --> 32:22.326
I love you baby.

32:24.361 --> 32:26.063
Mina, Charlie let's go,

32:26.096 --> 32:27.599
time to change.

32:27.632 --> 32:28.499
You know what,

32:28.532 --> 32:31.636
I think Mina's gonna
sit this one out.

32:31.669 --> 32:35.005
No, really?
I'm hurting pretty bad.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.076
All right, well, it's your loss.

32:40.210 --> 32:43.046
Charlie come one,
let's get going.

32:45.148 --> 32:47.084
No, don't give me that.

32:47.117 --> 32:48.653
Come on, let's go.

32:48.686 --> 32:49.687
I'm sorry.

32:54.157 --> 32:55.760
Fine, well, you're
cooking tonight

32:55.793 --> 32:58.328
and I'm getting fucked up.

32:58.362 --> 32:59.429
Yeah, okay.

33:01.198 --> 33:02.533
Josh, you ready?

33:02.567 --> 33:04.167
Yeah, love you.

33:04.201 --> 33:05.670
I love you.

33:05.703 --> 33:07.471
Oh and Reggie's still
tied up out back,

33:07.504 --> 33:09.406
get him later in
case Taylor pops by.

33:09.439 --> 33:11.141
Yeah, I'll grab him, baby.

33:11.174 --> 33:12.610
Thank you.

33:28.292 --> 33:29.459
Are you okay?

33:31.663 --> 33:32.730
Not really.

33:36.366 --> 33:37.501
How you doing?

33:45.910 --> 33:48.245
What are you thinking?

33:48.278 --> 33:50.414
We're smarter than this.

33:53.618 --> 33:55.319
It can never happen again.

33:55.352 --> 33:56.688
Yeah.

33:57.855 --> 33:58.690
I mean it.

33:58.723 --> 34:00.524
Yeah, I'm with you.

34:06.631 --> 34:09.232
I really do love your brother.

34:10.768 --> 34:12.436
I know.

34:15.205 --> 34:18.375
Anyway, she ended up getting
my number from Charlie

34:18.408 --> 34:21.478
and she texted me the punchline

34:21.511 --> 34:23.681
of this joke that she
had totally butchered,

34:23.715 --> 34:25.482
from the night we met.

34:25.514 --> 34:27.250
That's really cute.

34:27.284 --> 34:28.786
What was the punchline?

34:29.687 --> 34:30.621
Don't make me say it.

34:35.860 --> 34:37.460
You know, you and Charlie,

34:37.494 --> 34:40.429
you guys have like the best,
how did you meet, story.

34:40.464 --> 34:42.600
It is a pretty good one.

34:43.668 --> 34:45.637
Although, I can
think of one person

34:45.670 --> 34:47.504
who thinks otherwise.

34:49.339 --> 34:51.743
What do you mean, who?

34:51.775 --> 34:54.277
Wait, you know that
when Charlie and I met,

34:54.311 --> 34:56.413
he and Jen were still
together, right?

34:56.446 --> 34:57.314
Really?

34:58.783 --> 35:01.251
Wow, so, the ecstasy
night, that actually.

35:01.284 --> 35:02.654
Yeah, he had a girlfriend.

35:02.687 --> 35:04.287
Whoa.

35:04.321 --> 35:06.523
I know, it was not ideal.

35:07.792 --> 35:10.728
I randomly think
of her sometimes.

35:10.762 --> 35:12.396
She was a nice person,

35:12.429 --> 35:14.699
she didn't deserve that.

35:14.732 --> 35:17.367
I wouldn't say she was
totally innocent either.

35:17.401 --> 35:18.936
What do you mean?

35:18.970 --> 35:21.505
I think she had a little of
that same thing going on,

35:21.538 --> 35:23.708
with his previous girlfriend.

35:23.741 --> 35:26.376
What, like he was with
someone when he met Jen?

35:26.410 --> 35:27.845
Yeah, I think so,

35:28.913 --> 35:30.715
I don't remember all the details

35:30.748 --> 35:32.617
but there was this girl Zoe

35:32.650 --> 35:35.519
and then the Jen thing
happened really fast,

35:35.553 --> 35:38.288
a little bit too fast, you know.

35:39.991 --> 35:42.259
No, I didn't know that.

35:46.030 --> 35:46.898
Oh.

35:50.935 --> 35:53.503
Look man, I just meant,

35:53.537 --> 35:57.340
you shouldn't feel bad
anybody Jen, you know.

35:58.843 --> 36:00.778
It's fine.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.582
I don't even know what
I'm talking about,

36:04.615 --> 36:06.784
this was like 10 years ago.

36:07.919 --> 36:11.789
It's okay, let's
just keep going.

36:43.654 --> 36:44.722
Hey.

36:46.389 --> 36:47.992
They did pretty good.

36:52.830 --> 36:55.767
You can keep
sleeping, I'll finish.

37:31.736 --> 37:32.603
Charlie.

37:35.505 --> 37:38.408
Tell me that's not a camera.

37:38.441 --> 37:40.477
No fucking way.

37:40.510 --> 37:42.079
I'm gonna call the cops.

37:42.113 --> 37:43.614
Wait, wait.

37:43.648 --> 37:45.917
What, where are you going?

37:56.393 --> 37:57.394
Fuck.
No.

38:04.802 --> 38:08.005
We can't call the cops.
What, why?

38:08.039 --> 38:09.841
It's all on camera.

38:10.808 --> 38:11.943
If we report this,

38:11.976 --> 38:15.545
then Michelle and Josh they
could find out everything.

38:15.580 --> 38:18.649
So, what, we just let this
fucking racist pervert,

38:18.683 --> 38:19.617
get away with it?

38:19.650 --> 38:23.888
I don't know, I don't
know, let me think.

38:23.921 --> 38:27.725
Ew, just thinking of
him jacking off to it.

38:40.571 --> 38:43.506
I think, we pretend
like it didn't happen.

38:43.540 --> 38:45.877
What?
What are our other options?

38:45.910 --> 38:48.145
I don't know, threaten him
to give us the footage.

38:48.179 --> 38:49.747
I'm pretty sure threatening him

38:49.780 --> 38:51.082
is the best way to ensure

38:51.115 --> 38:55.186
that he shows Michelle
and Josh everything.

38:55.219 --> 38:56.888
Fucking kill him.

38:59.123 --> 39:02.860
Okay, clearly we
can't stay the night,

39:02.894 --> 39:04.962
so, we just need to
think of a reason

39:04.996 --> 39:09.466
to tell Josh and Michelle
why we're leaving early,

39:09.499 --> 39:11.035
like, Taylor came by and
said some racist shit

39:11.068 --> 39:11.969
or something like that.

39:12.003 --> 39:13.503
You know how protective Josh is,

39:13.536 --> 39:14.906
he wouldn't leave
without confronting him.

39:14.939 --> 39:16.073
Yeah but, I'll deal with Josh.

39:16.107 --> 39:17.041
No, no, no, no,
we start telling.

39:17.074 --> 39:17.708
We'll figure it out.

39:17.742 --> 39:18.943
We start telling more lies,

39:18.976 --> 39:20.645
it just gets messy.

39:22.847 --> 39:24.649
Oh, come on.

39:26.684 --> 39:27.919
It's gonna be okay.

39:27.952 --> 39:29.787
So, we do nothing,

39:29.820 --> 39:30.621
is that what you're saying?

39:30.655 --> 39:31.722
He can't show
anyone the footage,

39:31.756 --> 39:32.657
or else he gets caught,

39:32.690 --> 39:36.227
he's the only one who's
ever gonna see it.

39:36.260 --> 39:37.094
We get through the night,

39:37.128 --> 39:40.631
we leave first thing
in the morning,

39:40.665 --> 39:41.866
never happened.

39:51.742 --> 39:55.713
Hey, thought we almost
lost you guys out there.

39:55.746 --> 39:59.150
Someone got tan and sexy.
Oh yeah?

39:59.183 --> 40:01.085
Yeah.

40:01.118 --> 40:02.053
Did you have fun?

40:02.086 --> 40:03.955
Hey, missed you boo.

40:11.295 --> 40:13.664
Is everything okay?

40:13.698 --> 40:14.531
Yeah.

40:14.565 --> 40:15.967
What's going on?

40:17.201 --> 40:19.170
You know what, let me
get out of these clothes,

40:19.203 --> 40:20.738
hop into the shower

40:20.771 --> 40:22.840
and I will regale you with
the heartwarming tale,

40:22.873 --> 40:24.041
that was our hike.

40:24.075 --> 40:25.743
Oh, you're gonna take a shower?

40:25.776 --> 40:27.611
Yeah, can't you smell me.

40:27.645 --> 40:28.446
No, I don't know,

40:28.478 --> 40:31.816
I just, I get turned
on by your mess.

40:31.849 --> 40:33.184
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

40:34.618 --> 40:35.753
Okay.

40:39.957 --> 40:42.560
What's going on?

40:42.593 --> 40:43.294
What do you mean?

40:43.327 --> 40:45.863
I don't know, are you okay?

40:48.866 --> 40:50.067
Where you and Zoe broken up

40:50.101 --> 40:53.104
when you started dating Jen?

40:53.137 --> 40:54.005
What?

40:55.172 --> 40:57.241
Where's this coming from?

41:00.711 --> 41:01.579
Hello.

41:05.750 --> 41:07.318
I don't remember exactly
how it played out

41:07.351 --> 41:10.321
but yeah, there may
have been a situation

41:10.354 --> 41:12.189
where we hung out
for the first time,

41:12.223 --> 41:15.226
while I was breaking
up with Zoe.

41:15.259 --> 41:16.327
So, when you met Jen,

41:16.360 --> 41:17.661
you were definitely
still with Zoe?

41:17.695 --> 41:19.563
I think so, you know,

41:19.597 --> 41:22.133
but what is happening right now?

41:24.769 --> 41:27.271
I was just thinking about us

41:27.304 --> 41:30.341
and the circumstances in
which we got together,

41:30.374 --> 41:32.243
and I thought it
was funny to hear

41:32.276 --> 41:35.613
that you have a
pattern of doing this.

41:36.714 --> 41:38.349
Okay, so, this is a
conversation you had

41:38.382 --> 41:40.051
with Josh, I assume.

41:40.084 --> 41:42.119
What exactly did my
fucking brother say?

41:42.153 --> 41:42.820
Don't do that.
No,

41:42.853 --> 41:45.022
it tickles me to think that Josh

41:45.056 --> 41:47.158
has been keeping such close tabs

41:47.191 --> 41:48.959
on my dating history.

41:50.227 --> 41:51.629
I just wonder why you
would've lied to me

41:51.662 --> 41:52.696
about it at the time.

41:52.730 --> 41:53.798
I don't think I lied to you,

41:53.831 --> 41:55.166
I don't remember the details.

41:55.199 --> 41:59.070
Whatever I said at the
time was probably true.

42:07.778 --> 42:11.582
Migrate to the nesting beach.

42:16.220 --> 42:19.023
Okay, no, we're not doing this.

42:20.691 --> 42:23.694
This is not how
this trip is ending.

42:24.762 --> 42:26.964
We're gonna do drugs,

42:26.997 --> 42:28.132
we're gonna have fun.

42:28.165 --> 42:29.767
Mina, let's do it.

42:30.968 --> 42:32.269
Sorry.

42:32.303 --> 42:34.071
But you guys should
totally do whatever,

42:34.105 --> 42:35.306
don't let me stop you.

42:35.339 --> 42:36.040
Actually, you know, I think,

42:36.073 --> 42:38.342
I'm gonna sit this one out too.

42:38.375 --> 42:41.779
No, get up, get up, we said.

42:41.812 --> 42:43.848
Babe, what if we had
a more mellow night,

42:43.881 --> 42:46.951
played some board
games or something?

42:48.953 --> 42:51.755
You know what, go ahead

42:51.789 --> 42:53.190
and waste your last night.

42:53.224 --> 42:55.326
I thought we came here
to have a good time

42:55.359 --> 42:57.394
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

42:57.428 --> 42:58.929
Where's the molly?

42:58.963 --> 43:00.064
Don't tell me you
guys finished it

43:00.097 --> 43:01.132
or I will fucking.

43:01.165 --> 43:02.333
It's on the side, by the bar.

43:02.366 --> 43:04.101
There's plenty left.

43:14.445 --> 43:16.380
You sure you wanna do this?

43:16.413 --> 43:17.114
This was the plan.

43:17.148 --> 43:18.449
I went to bed early last night,

43:18.482 --> 43:19.750
so I can do this tonight,

43:19.783 --> 43:21.185
so, yes, I'm sure.

43:22.920 --> 43:23.787
Okay.

43:24.722 --> 43:25.389
Okay.

43:43.941 --> 43:44.808
Reg?

43:49.246 --> 43:51.650
Hey, you guys, where's Reggie?

43:55.519 --> 43:56.987
Baby, I'm so sorry.

43:57.021 --> 43:58.422
I was just so out
of it this morning,

43:58.455 --> 44:00.090
completely forgot.

44:00.124 --> 44:01.926
What's going on?

44:01.959 --> 44:04.195
Cool, good to know.

44:04.228 --> 44:06.030
No, no, no, no, no.

44:07.097 --> 44:07.932
Reg.

44:09.767 --> 44:10.434
Reggie.

44:11.402 --> 44:13.370
Okay, he's gotta be
around here somewhere.

44:13.404 --> 44:14.872
Fuck.
Josh, it's all right,

44:14.905 --> 44:15.839
we'll find him.

44:15.873 --> 44:17.208
Let's spread out.

44:17.241 --> 44:20.411
What if he fell off
the side of the cliff?

44:20.444 --> 44:21.812
Fuck.

44:21.845 --> 44:23.247
Reggie.
Reggie.

44:25.482 --> 44:26.350
Reggie.

44:27.985 --> 44:30.321
Oh fuck, they lost the dog.

44:32.790 --> 44:34.191
Reggie.
Reggie.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.161
Reggie.
Reg.

44:39.930 --> 44:41.398
Reggie.

44:44.435 --> 44:45.436
Reggie.

44:45.469 --> 44:46.904
Reggie.

44:46.937 --> 44:47.838
Hey Reg.

44:49.373 --> 44:51.909
Come on Reg.

44:51.942 --> 44:53.177
Reggie.

45:04.221 --> 45:05.456
Any luck?

45:05.489 --> 45:07.424
No, it's too dark,

45:07.458 --> 45:08.993
we got no phones.

45:10.261 --> 45:11.128
Hey, did you forget to turn off

45:11.161 --> 45:14.131
the hot tub, last
night, it's broken?

45:14.164 --> 45:15.132
I don't know, maybe.

45:15.165 --> 45:18.202
Well, whatever, I called Taylor.

45:18.235 --> 45:19.937
What, why?

45:19.970 --> 45:22.273
Well because it's not working

45:22.306 --> 45:24.808
and I would like it
to start working,

45:24.842 --> 45:26.310
so I can get in it.

45:27.579 --> 45:29.480
So, he's coming here right now?

45:29.513 --> 45:30.147
Yeah.

45:30.180 --> 45:32.249
Who's coming over right now?

45:32.283 --> 45:35.352
Taylor's coming to
fix the hot tub.

45:36.420 --> 45:40.057
Babe, I wish you'd told
me before you did that.

45:40.090 --> 45:41.091
He's just gonna come and go,

45:41.125 --> 45:42.860
what's the big deal?

45:42.893 --> 45:43.861
I know, I just,

45:43.894 --> 45:47.131
I just know that Mina
doesn't like the guy.

45:47.164 --> 45:48.899
It's fine,

45:48.932 --> 45:50.334
I'm fine.

45:50.367 --> 45:52.336
It's fine, she's fine.

45:52.369 --> 45:53.837
Hey, what if he took him?

45:53.871 --> 45:56.307
What if who took, what?

45:56.340 --> 46:00.010
What is Taylor came
by and saw Reggie?

46:00.044 --> 46:03.113
You think Taylor took Reggie?

46:03.147 --> 46:05.149
Maybe.

46:05.182 --> 46:07.885
Well, I just don't think
he would agree to come by

46:07.918 --> 46:10.888
and help me, if he was
holding your dog hostage.

46:10.921 --> 46:11.790
I guess, we'll see.

46:11.822 --> 46:13.190
What are you gonna
straight up ask him?

46:13.223 --> 46:13.924
Yeah.

46:13.957 --> 46:14.759
I'm pretty sure he's gonna know

46:14.793 --> 46:16.226
that we snuck a
dog into his house,

46:16.260 --> 46:17.227
if you ask him about it.

46:17.261 --> 46:19.196
My fucking dog is missing, okay.

46:19.229 --> 46:22.833
If he knows something,
I'm gonna find out.

46:38.315 --> 46:39.316
He's here.

46:40.618 --> 46:41.485
Finally.

46:46.123 --> 46:47.324
Hey, evening buddy.

46:47.358 --> 46:51.228
Hey, where you at the
house, at all, today?

46:51.261 --> 46:52.529
No, not today.

46:53.598 --> 46:55.299
Yeah, I've been at
my place all day,

46:55.332 --> 46:57.301
on the couch with my bottle.

46:57.334 --> 46:58.135
Is that right?

46:58.168 --> 46:59.571
That is correct.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.475
Is that white girl here?

47:04.508 --> 47:06.578
She called about the tub.

47:08.178 --> 47:10.047
Did you take my dog?

47:12.983 --> 47:14.184
What?

47:14.218 --> 47:16.019
Did you take my dog?

47:16.053 --> 47:17.388
No, I heard what
you said partner,

47:17.421 --> 47:19.056
I'm just trying to figure out

47:19.089 --> 47:21.258
why you got a dog in
here, in the first place.

47:21.291 --> 47:24.596
Why don't you just
answer the question?

47:26.497 --> 47:28.899
No, didn't take your dog.

47:33.203 --> 47:34.071
Hey, hi,

47:35.372 --> 47:36.440
I called you.

47:37.474 --> 47:39.343
Full disclosure, I'm on drugs,

47:39.376 --> 47:41.412
I would just love to
get in that hot tub

47:41.445 --> 47:43.681
as soon as humanly possible.

47:43.715 --> 47:44.582
Thank you.

47:50.187 --> 47:54.592
She probably shouldn't be
out there, alone with him.

47:58.429 --> 48:01.031
Baby, what are you thinking?

48:02.232 --> 48:05.002
I don't know what
to fucking think.

48:05.035 --> 48:06.303
What can I do?

48:07.371 --> 48:08.205
Let's just find Reggie,

48:08.238 --> 48:11.241
get the fuck out
of here, all right.

48:19.784 --> 48:20.718
What the?

48:22.519 --> 48:24.188
All right, hold on.

48:29.359 --> 48:30.227
Yeah.

48:36.568 --> 48:37.669
Yeah.

48:37.702 --> 48:39.771
Program was stuck
in cleaning mode,

48:39.804 --> 48:41.338
should be good to go now.

48:41.371 --> 48:42.607
Oh, thank you so much,

48:42.640 --> 48:45.108
you're a lifesaver.

48:45.142 --> 48:47.579
Well, enjoy your final night.

48:49.046 --> 48:50.715
Thank you.

48:52.483 --> 48:55.285
Stay with me, 'til it warms up.

49:00.558 --> 49:01.559
Reggie.

49:01.593 --> 49:04.394
Come here boy, Reg.

49:04.428 --> 49:05.295
Reggie.

49:08.700 --> 49:09.567
Reggie.

49:12.302 --> 49:13.170
Hey.

49:15.439 --> 49:17.374
Hope you find your dog.

49:18.475 --> 49:20.177
I got two of 'em myself.

49:20.210 --> 49:22.045
That whole, no dogs policy,

49:22.079 --> 49:23.615
is my brothers idea.

49:24.515 --> 49:28.418
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna rat you out.

49:28.452 --> 49:30.722
I know how to keep a secret.

49:32.857 --> 49:35.693
Well, if there's
not anything else.

49:35.727 --> 49:39.229
Actually, can I show you
one last thing, real quick?

49:39.263 --> 49:40.130
Yep.

49:44.301 --> 49:45.637
Oh, let me guess,

49:46.503 --> 49:48.272
it's that toilet hah?

49:51.308 --> 49:52.844
Yeah, you gotta hold
that flusher down,

49:52.877 --> 49:55.312
a lot longer than you think.

49:56.513 --> 49:57.548
I just want you to know

49:57.582 --> 49:59.717
that if you ever do
anything with that footage,

49:59.751 --> 50:01.753
we go right to the cops.

50:05.155 --> 50:06.591
Excuse me?

50:06.624 --> 50:08.693
We know, okay.

50:08.726 --> 50:10.394
Look, I don't really know
what's happening right now,

50:10.427 --> 50:12.095
what are you doing?

50:13.430 --> 50:16.533
Jesus, you gonna make me
actually fucking do this?

50:16.568 --> 50:17.434
What?

50:26.878 --> 50:28.780
What the hell is that?

50:28.813 --> 50:31.649
Dude, we fucking got you.

50:31.683 --> 50:33.818
Look, I don't know what
scam you're trying to pull,

50:33.851 --> 50:35.519
but you go ahead
and call the police.

50:35.553 --> 50:36.520
Are you listening to me?

50:36.554 --> 50:37.822
I didn't have nothing
to do with that shit.

50:37.855 --> 50:39.122
I'm giving you a fucking out,

50:39.156 --> 50:40.324
we could've turned
you in already.

50:40.357 --> 50:42.292
You know what, how about I
call the police for you, hah?

50:42.326 --> 50:43.027
What?

50:43.061 --> 50:43.995
No, that's not what I'm saying.

50:44.028 --> 50:45.597
Hey, hey, hey.
That's not what I'm saying.

50:45.630 --> 50:46.496
Reggie.

50:51.936 --> 50:55.272
Stop, don't be stupid.
You motherfuckers.

50:55.305 --> 50:56.206
Baby.

51:01.445 --> 51:03.581
Josh, stop.

51:03.615 --> 51:05.415
Josh, that's enough.

51:05.449 --> 51:06.316
Stop.

51:12.924 --> 51:14.659
That's enough.

51:14.692 --> 51:15.525
Hey,

51:15.560 --> 51:17.361
hey, hey, hey, hey.

51:17.394 --> 51:18.261
Come here.

51:46.724 --> 51:47.759
He was about to call the cops

51:47.792 --> 51:50.695
and I freaked out and it
just escalated, I'm sorry.

51:50.728 --> 51:52.295
Fuck, fuck.

51:52.329 --> 51:52.964
We're so fucked.

51:52.997 --> 51:54.799
What are we gonna do?

51:56.333 --> 51:57.902
What just happened?

52:01.471 --> 52:02.339
You guys?

52:09.346 --> 52:11.348
He was filming us.

52:11.381 --> 52:12.784
What?

52:12.817 --> 52:15.687
I was taking a shower earlier

52:15.720 --> 52:17.855
and I saw something weird,

52:18.990 --> 52:20.591
like a camera,

52:20.625 --> 52:22.392
but I didn't know for sure

52:22.426 --> 52:23.928
and I just, I felt
really scared,

52:23.961 --> 52:25.362
I didn't know what to do.

52:25.395 --> 52:26.597
And while I was
dealing with that,

52:26.631 --> 52:28.231
you guys got back to the place

52:28.265 --> 52:30.735
and I was just gonna let it go.

52:32.502 --> 52:33.771
I was hoping it wasn't real,

52:33.805 --> 52:35.405
but then when Taylor came by,

52:35.439 --> 52:36.506
I couldn't hold back

52:36.540 --> 52:38.609
and I confronted him and.

52:40.277 --> 52:42.479
It definitely was a camera.

52:44.281 --> 52:46.818
And then Josh heard us fighting.

52:48.385 --> 52:49.386
I fucked up.

52:51.789 --> 52:52.690
I'm so sorry,

52:52.724 --> 52:53.858
I should've just said
something to you,

52:53.891 --> 52:55.258
I should've told you.

52:55.292 --> 52:56.627
It's all right.

52:59.797 --> 53:02.867
Oh my God, did you
find any others?

53:19.751 --> 53:21.753
Yes, I'm fucking disgusted,
he was watching us,

53:21.786 --> 53:24.521
but we have to
call an ambulance.

53:24.555 --> 53:26.356
What are we gonna tell him?

53:26.389 --> 53:28.291
He beat him to a pulp.

53:28.325 --> 53:30.895
I'm sorry, Josh, there's
no way around it.

53:30.928 --> 53:32.529
He was attacking
her when I came in.

53:32.563 --> 53:35.298
I know, but it's all on camera.

53:35.332 --> 53:36.234
Once they see that footage,

53:36.266 --> 53:38.069
I don't think the
self defense argument

53:38.102 --> 53:39.536
is gonna hold up.

53:39.570 --> 53:41.505
He's a racist piece of shit

53:41.538 --> 53:45.308
who was filming us in
the shower, all right.

53:45.342 --> 53:47.578
I didn't do anything wrong.

53:47.612 --> 53:48.813
Go ahead, call.

53:56.020 --> 53:58.488
I'm gonna check on Taylor.

54:04.662 --> 54:06.597
It wasn't your fault.

54:09.033 --> 54:12.570
I was just trying to
protect you, you know.

54:12.603 --> 54:13.470
I know.

54:19.677 --> 54:21.679
Michelle wait.

54:21.712 --> 54:22.580
What?

54:23.513 --> 54:25.315
He's not breathing.

54:38.696 --> 54:40.363
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

54:54.879 --> 54:56.948
Look, he was fine, just
a second ago, right,

54:56.981 --> 54:58.115
I didn't even.

55:00.117 --> 55:02.720
How did he even die from that?

55:07.490 --> 55:08.759
What do we do?

55:11.128 --> 55:12.797
What do you mean?

55:13.798 --> 55:18.870
I mean, like, what do
we do, I don't know?

55:18.903 --> 55:20.872
We have to call the police.

55:20.905 --> 55:22.573
We can't do that.

55:23.774 --> 55:25.176
It's different now.

55:25.209 --> 55:26.677
Yeah, he's fucking dead.

55:26.711 --> 55:27.945
Exactly, the second we call in,

55:27.979 --> 55:29.780
they're sending Josh
straight back to jail.

55:29.814 --> 55:30.915
They're not gonna
go easy on him.

55:30.948 --> 55:33.450
Josh killed a man.

55:33.483 --> 55:34.417
Are you grasping this?

55:34.451 --> 55:36.453
This is actually happening.
I know, I know,

55:36.486 --> 55:37.788
but I do not wanna
see my little brother

55:37.822 --> 55:40.825
go to jail for the
rest of his life.

55:44.562 --> 55:48.431
There's gotta be
something we can do.

55:48.465 --> 55:49.466
Like what?

55:52.036 --> 55:53.436
I don't know,

55:56.073 --> 55:58.776
like what if it was an accident?

56:01.112 --> 56:01.979
What?

56:05.548 --> 56:09.220
He had a shit ton of
alcohol in his system right?

56:09.253 --> 56:11.454
Like, who's to say
he didn't just,

56:11.488 --> 56:13.224
drunkenly stumble
over the cliff.

56:13.257 --> 56:14.959
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56:14.992 --> 56:15.993
He had a few too many

56:16.027 --> 56:17.895
and he came to clean up
the place after we left,

56:17.929 --> 56:19.130
and he slipped.

56:21.098 --> 56:24.168
We are not having
his conversation.

56:28.806 --> 56:31.876
Michelle called
him from her phone,

56:32.743 --> 56:34.477
they can track that.

56:39.549 --> 56:41.085
Right, but the call logs
don't actually prove

56:41.118 --> 56:43.020
that we ever saw him.

56:43.054 --> 56:45.256
I mean, there's a million
reasons she could've called him.

56:45.289 --> 56:46.924
This is fucking crazy.

56:46.958 --> 56:47.992
What about the footage,

56:48.025 --> 56:49.560
it's all on tape.

56:54.799 --> 56:59.236
I don't know, I guess we have
to get to rid of it somehow.

56:59.270 --> 57:01.605
The camera was wireless.

57:02.807 --> 57:04.608
Those things don't
have that much range,

57:04.642 --> 57:09.013
the receiver's probably
somewhere in this house.

57:09.046 --> 57:10.513
No.

57:11.983 --> 57:13.851
Babe this could work.

57:13.884 --> 57:16.253
I'm not saying we
can't get away with it,

57:16.287 --> 57:18.756
I'm saying I don't want
to get away with it.

57:18.789 --> 57:19.690
We will take care of everything,

57:19.724 --> 57:21.792
you wouldn't have to
be involved at all.

57:21.826 --> 57:23.094
You're not listening to me,

57:23.127 --> 57:24.228
I'm not gonna live
the rest of my life,

57:24.261 --> 57:25.763
knowing that we killed some guy

57:25.796 --> 57:28.531
and didn't do anything about it.

57:57.328 --> 57:58.195
Three.

58:45.309 --> 58:49.113
I just came to say,
we'll be outside.

58:49.146 --> 58:49.814
I won't say anymore,

58:49.847 --> 58:53.317
you had nothing to do with this.

58:53.350 --> 58:55.152
I'm already guilty.

58:56.720 --> 58:57.388
No you aren't,

58:57.421 --> 59:00.091
you didn't do anything.

59:00.124 --> 59:03.094
I didn't call the police.

59:03.127 --> 59:05.696
If we get caught, I'm
an accomplice to murder,

59:05.729 --> 59:07.665
just like you and Mina.

59:16.807 --> 59:19.810
We can say you
weren't even here.

59:19.844 --> 59:21.345
Just go, go do
what you need to do

59:21.378 --> 59:23.647
so we can get outta here.

59:26.117 --> 59:30.054
It'll be over soon, I promise.

59:30.087 --> 59:32.223
This will never be over.

01:00:19.937 --> 01:00:22.406
Okay, okay, you ready?
Yeah.

01:00:37.988 --> 01:00:38.856
Fuck.

01:00:41.926 --> 01:00:42.793
Fuck.

01:01:35.145 --> 01:01:38.816
Okay on three, one, two, three.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.834
What the fuck are you doing?

01:02:30.868 --> 01:02:33.237
Josh, don't.

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:35.139
You crazy?

01:02:35.172 --> 01:02:37.474
I killed him, all right.

01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:39.843
I'm not letting you two go
to jail 'cause I fucked up,

01:02:39.877 --> 01:02:41.078
just let me finish this.

01:02:41.111 --> 01:02:43.247
Baby, it's not worth it.

01:02:44.616 --> 01:02:45.816
It's okay.

01:02:47.985 --> 01:02:51.221
All right, it's
okay, just let go.

01:02:51.255 --> 01:02:53.190
Let go, it's all right.

01:03:00.565 --> 01:03:02.533
Please be careful.

01:03:02.567 --> 01:03:03.434
Go slow.

01:03:24.622 --> 01:03:27.625
Shit, use your
light, mine's dead.

01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:47.177
Josh.

01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:05.295
Are you okay?
You okay, J?

01:04:08.566 --> 01:04:09.967
I'm okay.

01:04:19.744 --> 01:04:21.211
See you in hell.

01:05:07.057 --> 01:05:08.192
Here.

01:05:13.363 --> 01:05:14.431
Are you okay?

01:05:16.133 --> 01:05:17.000
Jesus.

01:05:22.506 --> 01:05:25.710
Let's just find that
fucking footage.

01:05:41.659 --> 01:05:43.060
Stop, what are you doing.

01:05:43.093 --> 01:05:44.061
Stop.

01:05:44.094 --> 01:05:45.362
Stop the car.

01:05:45.395 --> 01:05:47.130
Where are you going?

01:05:56.106 --> 01:05:57.307
I know, I know.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:00.344
The worst part is over.

01:06:00.377 --> 01:06:03.247
Just one last, tiny thing.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.081
I saw you.

01:06:05.215 --> 01:06:07.217
You saw, what are
you talking about?

01:06:07.251 --> 01:06:08.452
You and Mina.

01:06:15.192 --> 01:06:16.126
Okay, listen, I fucked up,

01:06:16.159 --> 01:06:16.794
that was a huge mistake,

01:06:16.828 --> 01:06:19.363
it didn't mean anything.

01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:20.798
Baby, please, I'm
so sorry, I'm so.

01:06:20.832 --> 01:06:22.567
I can't even fucking
look at you, right now.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.067
Baby please, I'm
sorry, let me explain,

01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:25.003
let me explain please.

01:06:25.035 --> 01:06:27.572
Will you look at me
please baby, please.

01:06:27.605 --> 01:06:28.472
Please.

01:06:31.643 --> 01:06:35.647
Okay, first off, where
did you find the footage?

01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:40.484
Who are you?

01:06:42.654 --> 01:06:45.188
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:57.401 --> 01:06:59.503
Hey, hey what just happened?

01:06:59.536 --> 01:07:00.605
Where's she going?

01:07:00.638 --> 01:07:01.305
She hit her limit

01:07:01.338 --> 01:07:02.840
and she couldn't take anymore.

01:07:02.874 --> 01:07:03.708
What does that mean?

01:07:03.741 --> 01:07:04.742
Is she going to the cops?

01:07:04.776 --> 01:07:06.510
No, she just had to go.

01:07:06.543 --> 01:07:07.712
Wait, wait, wait,
is she coming back?

01:07:07.745 --> 01:07:10.414
Hey, how are we
gonna get outta here?

01:07:10.447 --> 01:07:11.381
Hey.

01:07:11.415 --> 01:07:13.517
Look, this is not okay,
Charlie, all right,

01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:15.319
stop being so fucking calm.

01:07:15.352 --> 01:07:16.186
Everything is fine.

01:07:16.219 --> 01:07:18.288
Look, we just, we
stick to the plan,

01:07:18.322 --> 01:07:19.289
we find the footage

01:07:19.323 --> 01:07:22.794
and then we figure out
how to get outta here.

01:07:50.287 --> 01:07:51.488
Fuck.

01:08:15.847 --> 01:08:17.180
What the fuck?

01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:35.827
Guys, Michelle's in trouble.

01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:39.328
She's down the road,
I'll be right back.

01:09:49.372 --> 01:09:50.240
Babe.

01:09:52.777 --> 01:09:53.644
Babe.

01:10:07.357 --> 01:10:08.025
Michelle.

01:10:21.839 --> 01:10:23.808
Oh, thank God.

01:10:23.841 --> 01:10:27.444
Jesus, boo, you scared
the shit out of me.

01:11:16.894 --> 01:11:19.429
What do you see?

01:11:19.462 --> 01:11:22.066
Just a bunch of boxes and junk.

01:11:30.174 --> 01:11:33.543
It's gotta be here somewhere.

01:11:33.578 --> 01:11:35.847
This is so fucked up.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.615
Just help me look.

01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:42.419
Are we sure we even know
what we're looking for?

01:11:42.452 --> 01:11:45.122
A computer, hard drive,

01:11:45.156 --> 01:11:46.691
router, anything.

01:11:54.665 --> 01:11:55.532
Oh, Jesus.

01:11:56.433 --> 01:11:58.569
What, what is it?

01:12:00.738 --> 01:12:02.940
Oh, you don't wanna know.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.681
Anything?

01:12:11.883 --> 01:12:12.750
No.

01:12:17.889 --> 01:12:21.692
Part of me expected to
find a control room,

01:12:24.595 --> 01:12:27.865
a whole bunch of TV
monitors, something.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.001
It's okay.

01:12:31.168 --> 01:12:33.170
Let's just keep looking.

01:12:35.573 --> 01:12:38.508
I'm such a fucking
piece of shit.

01:12:40.543 --> 01:12:44.181
I don't know what the
fucks wrong with me.

01:12:44.215 --> 01:12:47.551
You know, and I
dragged you into this.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.453
No, you didn't.

01:12:54.158 --> 01:12:56.694
We're gonna get through this.

01:12:59.096 --> 01:13:01.565
I just need a minute here.

01:13:04.769 --> 01:13:06.170
I'll be outside.

01:13:32.296 --> 01:13:33.164
Baby.

01:13:40.805 --> 01:13:41.672
Charlie.

01:13:54.285 --> 01:13:55.820
Are you okay?

01:13:55.853 --> 01:13:57.788
Not really.

01:13:57.822 --> 01:14:01.225
What are you thinking?

01:14:09.734 --> 01:14:13.204
Hey, baby, can I
show you something.

01:14:13.237 --> 01:14:14.105
Did you find it?

01:14:14.138 --> 01:14:16.140
No, no, it's not that,

01:14:18.342 --> 01:14:21.812
I just got this weird
text from Charlie.

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:25.016
What did he say?

01:14:25.049 --> 01:14:26.250
Are you okay?

01:14:26.283 --> 01:14:28.052
Not really.

01:14:28.085 --> 01:14:30.321
What are you thinking?

01:14:30.354 --> 01:14:33.324
We're smarter than this.

01:14:33.357 --> 01:14:35.192
What is this?

01:14:35.226 --> 01:14:36.694
I don't know.

01:14:36.727 --> 01:14:38.162
It can never happen again.

01:14:38.195 --> 01:14:41.732
I mean, this is you
and Charlie, right?

01:14:41.766 --> 01:14:43.234
Yeah, I think so.

01:14:44.235 --> 01:14:46.737
I mean, yes, but I don't.

01:14:46.771 --> 01:14:49.173
What can never happen again?

01:14:50.074 --> 01:14:50.941
What?

01:14:52.176 --> 01:14:55.746
In the recording, you said,
"That can never happen again."

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.049
What were you talking about?

01:15:05.089 --> 01:15:06.557
What's going on?

01:15:11.896 --> 01:15:13.631
How did Charlie get
this photo of you?

01:15:13.664 --> 01:15:15.666
Why the fuck is he
sending this to me?

01:15:15.699 --> 01:15:17.735
I don't know.

01:15:17.768 --> 01:15:19.236
Don't look at that.

01:15:22.039 --> 01:15:22.873
I'm sorry.

01:15:25.643 --> 01:15:26.310
Charlie.

01:15:27.411 --> 01:15:30.314
I'm gonna fucking
kill you Charlie.

01:15:38.289 --> 01:15:40.157
You gonna send me this shit

01:15:40.191 --> 01:15:42.059
and you're gonna hide?

01:15:53.037 --> 01:15:53.904
Charlie.

01:16:23.434 --> 01:16:24.301
Josh.

01:22:38.509 --> 01:22:40.344
Come on in.

01:22:40.377 --> 01:22:42.079
There's a bathroom there,

01:22:42.112 --> 01:22:42.780
bedroom.

01:22:51.154 --> 01:22:53.223
There's a beautiful view.

01:23:00.197 --> 01:23:01.198
Wifi, Cable.

01:23:05.502 --> 01:23:06.370
Enjoy.
