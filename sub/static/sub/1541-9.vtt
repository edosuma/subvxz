00:02.052 --> 00:03.618
Previously
on "the vampire diaries"...

00:03.620 --> 00:05.491
Elena: I get that we had
an amazing life together,

00:05.492 --> 00:07.458
but now I feel like
I'm looking at a stranger.

00:08.691 --> 00:10.258
Kai: To get home, we'll harness
the power of the eclipse,

00:10.260 --> 00:11.526
using an Ascendant.

00:11.528 --> 00:13.027
Elena: What about Bonnie?

00:13.029 --> 00:14.495
Damon: She sacrificed
herself so I could come back.

00:14.497 --> 00:15.997
Stefan: Jo is
his sister?

00:15.999 --> 00:17.532
Jo: In our coven, Kai
wanted to be the leader,

00:17.534 --> 00:20.434
but that wasn't if
Lukas and Olivia were alive.

00:20.436 --> 00:22.103
I'm not gonna
let you die.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.905
Joshua: If Kai gets out,
he'll head straight for Jo.

00:23.907 --> 00:26.174
His ability to siphon
magic will overwhelm Jo,

00:26.176 --> 00:29.810
and our coven will be left
to the whims of a madman.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.612
Kai: To do the spell,
all I need is Bennett blood.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.147
Bonnie: The bastard
took the car.

00:33.149 --> 00:34.715
The Ascendant's
with me.

00:34.717 --> 00:35.917
We're not letting
her brother out, all right?

00:35.919 --> 00:37.119
The Ascendant is
off the table.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.554
Ok. Get the Ascendant
from Jo.

00:39.556 --> 00:40.755
I understand.

00:40.757 --> 00:42.323
Look. I'm
at a crossroads.

00:42.325 --> 00:43.724
Any chance you'd be
willing to help me bring

00:43.726 --> 00:45.459
my best friend
Bonnie back?

00:45.461 --> 00:46.928
Sure.

00:48.665 --> 00:52.667
[Music playing]

00:52.669 --> 00:54.335
Jo: Knock knock.

00:54.337 --> 00:56.204
Hey. Come on in.

00:56.206 --> 00:57.505
Oh. It's one
of those nights.

00:57.507 --> 01:00.841
Oh, wow.
Your enthusiasm is amazing.

01:00.843 --> 01:01.943
I'm sorry.

01:01.945 --> 01:03.311
I've had a day
from hell,

01:03.313 --> 01:05.212
and I didn't
mean it.

01:05.215 --> 01:08.916
I did actually, but I'm gonna
call take backs, ok?

01:08.918 --> 01:10.418
Ok.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.921
Ooh, you got
Thai food.

01:13.923 --> 01:16.624
You know, I knew I should
have led with the food.

01:16.626 --> 01:20.294
Well, this is perfect.
I'm starving.

01:20.296 --> 01:22.997
Aww. Where's yours?

01:22.999 --> 01:25.299
Oh. Very funny.

01:25.301 --> 01:27.468
Stefan: You didn't compel him
to get her drunk.

01:27.470 --> 01:30.738
No. I compelled him
to do whatever it takes,

01:30.740 --> 01:33.140
and considering
the Ascendant is the key

01:33.142 --> 01:36.944
to her psycho brother's
weird prison world,

01:36.946 --> 01:39.413
I'm sure it's gonna take her a few to
open up about it.

01:39.415 --> 01:43.684
I swear your dad
loves me. Ha ha ha!

01:43.686 --> 01:46.020
I have never been given
so clear a blessing.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.990
You went to see him,
and he tried to kill me.

01:48.992 --> 01:50.358
How's that a blessing?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.660
Because he didn't
try to kill me.

01:52.662 --> 01:56.130
He just banished me
from your creepy childhood home.

01:56.132 --> 01:58.633
It wasn't creepy
back then.

01:58.635 --> 02:01.369
Once your brother
brutally murders your siblings,

02:01.371 --> 02:03.771
creep sets in.

02:03.773 --> 02:06.407
Oh. So you just--
you just ran.

02:06.409 --> 02:08.709
I didn't run.
They let me go.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.945
We made a deal.
Betray your brother

02:10.947 --> 02:12.513
and get
your freedom.

02:12.515 --> 02:16.150
So where does
the Ascendant fall under this deal?

02:16.152 --> 02:17.885
They didn't know
I had it.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.887
By the time I found out,
I was gone.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.089
I still don't understand
why you'd want it.

02:22.091 --> 02:26.027
It makes me feel safe,
like I'm in control.

02:26.029 --> 02:28.929
As long as I have it, then no one
can use it to get Kai out.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.865
Kai can't get me.

02:30.867 --> 02:32.633
Embarrassing,
but I actually used

02:32.635 --> 02:34.735
sleep with it
under my pillow.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.003
Used to?

02:36.005 --> 02:38.973
Yes, used to. I am
a grownup now obviously,

02:38.975 --> 02:43.077
and I keep it in my underwear drawer
next to my pot.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.912
Oh, ok.
Well, that explains

02:44.914 --> 02:46.714
why you're
always hungry.

02:46.716 --> 02:48.582
No. I'm always hungry
because I'm a vegetarian.

02:48.584 --> 02:52.053
Ok. Ha ha ha!

02:52.055 --> 02:55.122
Well...

02:55.124 --> 02:56.357
The last of it.

02:56.359 --> 02:57.825
Good.

03:00.229 --> 03:02.396
No more distractions.

03:02.398 --> 03:04.999
Stefan: You realize he is gonna kill you
when he finds out what you did to him.

03:05.001 --> 03:07.234
My relationship to ruin,
thank you.

03:07.236 --> 03:09.804
I didn't complain when
you ruined yours with Caroline.

03:09.806 --> 03:11.639
I didn't ruin my--

03:11.641 --> 03:13.107
Yeah. I'm sure
she's fine.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.375
She's on vacation
with her mom,

03:14.377 --> 03:16.043
eating ice cream out
of the carton,

03:16.045 --> 03:19.246
convincing herself she never liked you
in the first place.

03:19.248 --> 03:20.848
You done?

03:20.850 --> 03:22.450
Careful, Stefan.
I know it may

03:22.452 --> 03:24.585
seem easy to be
the big bad Salvatore,

03:24.587 --> 03:27.121
but soon, you'll find yourself lying in
the middle of the road,

03:27.123 --> 03:29.590
pouring your heart out
to a stranger,

03:29.592 --> 03:31.459
having
an existential crisis.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.795
Yeah, great. So, uh,
when's this grand theft gonna happen?

03:34.797 --> 03:36.464
Assuming everything
went well,

03:36.466 --> 03:39.567
it's already happened,
which means...

03:39.569 --> 03:41.602
[Footsteps]

03:44.073 --> 03:45.406
Here it is.

03:47.643 --> 03:50.444
Thanks, buddy.

03:50.446 --> 03:52.880
There you go.

03:52.882 --> 03:55.416
Go home to Jo,
be a good boyfriend,

03:55.418 --> 03:57.284
forget this
ever happened.

04:11.367 --> 04:13.134
Seriously, I shouldn't
be winning.

04:13.136 --> 04:15.102
Two weeks without booze
doesn't make you iron man.

04:15.104 --> 04:16.704
I can still vamp
circles around you.

04:16.706 --> 04:18.305
You mean, you can cheat.

04:18.307 --> 04:20.808
Ha! Or I could pants you
in front of the entire

04:20.810 --> 04:22.076
women's volleyball team.

04:22.077 --> 04:24.145
Doubt they'd mind.

04:24.147 --> 04:26.247
Ok. I give up.

04:26.249 --> 04:29.750
What did you do with my miserable
half-drunk brother?

04:29.752 --> 04:31.318
He canceled Bonnie's
cell phone,

04:31.320 --> 04:33.087
cried until there was
nothing left,

04:33.089 --> 04:34.455
and got all the grief
out of his system.

04:34.457 --> 04:38.559
He is ready
to move on.

04:38.561 --> 04:40.027
What?

04:41.998 --> 04:43.264
[Sighs]

04:43.266 --> 04:44.732
It's about Bonnie.

04:48.504 --> 04:50.838
Damon said she
found peace.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.373
He thought Kai
had killed her,

04:52.375 --> 04:54.175
but he just found out
that she's alive,

04:54.177 --> 04:55.609
and he's doing
everything that he can to--

04:55.611 --> 04:56.977
So you're back
to defending him. Wow!

04:56.979 --> 04:58.712
And all it took was
one hollow promise

04:58.714 --> 05:00.214
to bring Bonnie back.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.716
No. No, no, no, Jer.
It's not hollow.

05:02.718 --> 05:04.485
Liv's looking for a way
to send us over there

05:04.487 --> 05:06.053
so that we can find
Bonnie and bring her back.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.988
And if you can't?

05:07.990 --> 05:12.426
Jer, this is good news.

05:12.428 --> 05:15.362
You're right, Elena.
This is good news.

05:15.364 --> 05:17.164
Tonight, I'm gonna see
Bonnie again,

05:17.166 --> 05:20.134
and everything is gonna
go back to the way it was

05:20.136 --> 05:22.903
because I have never
heard that before.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.371
[Sighs]

05:28.144 --> 05:29.877
I brought you to Mystic Falls
to keep you safe

05:29.879 --> 05:31.812
from your crazy-ass
witch family.

05:31.814 --> 05:33.447
You can't just leave because Damon
wants you to do some spell.

05:33.449 --> 05:35.783
So, what, I'm
a prisoner here?

05:35.785 --> 05:38.252
Do I look like Rapunzel?

05:38.254 --> 05:40.621
Well, actually.

05:40.623 --> 05:42.022
Look. Why can't
Luke do it?

05:42.024 --> 05:43.757
Because he is busy
enjoying his last few weeks

05:43.759 --> 05:45.025
as a singular twin

05:45.027 --> 05:46.894
with his sugar daddy
radiologist,

05:46.896 --> 05:48.729
and I'd like to
enjoy mine.

05:48.731 --> 05:50.631
Matt, help me
out here.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.099
I can't.
It's for Bonnie.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.468
Tyler, I can't stay
locked up in here any longer.

05:54.470 --> 05:56.270
I'm out of clothes,
and I've had pizza for breakfast

05:56.272 --> 05:58.038
every day this week.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.607
We've got to get back
to our normal lives.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.242
If you leave and your
coven finds you--

06:01.244 --> 06:03.644
They'll make me merge
with my brother?

06:03.646 --> 06:05.312
Hey. It's not all bad.

06:05.314 --> 06:06.680
If I survive,
you'll be dating

06:06.682 --> 06:08.415
the all-powerful leader
of the Gemini coven,

06:08.417 --> 06:11.252
and if I don't,
you can date Luke.

06:11.254 --> 06:13.787
Hey.

06:13.789 --> 06:16.857
This isn't a joke
to me, ok?

06:16.859 --> 06:19.527
Well, I have to
laugh at it

06:19.529 --> 06:21.962
because if I start imagining my life
stuck in this town

06:21.964 --> 06:24.231
running away
from my family,

06:24.233 --> 06:26.233
I will fall apart.

06:29.372 --> 06:31.138
I'll find a way.

06:52.862 --> 06:56.497
And that was an actual fight
two people just had

06:56.499 --> 06:58.966
over a twin-merge?

06:58.968 --> 07:00.801
This town is so weird.

07:00.803 --> 07:02.269
You'll get used
to it.

07:02.271 --> 07:04.305
Or I won't,
and a vampire will kill me

07:04.307 --> 07:06.140
like they killed
your friend Tripp.

07:06.142 --> 07:08.776
That's not gonna happen
because I won't let it.

07:11.213 --> 07:14.448
And with that, the Mystic Falls
community protection program

07:14.450 --> 07:16.650
is officially
disbanded.

07:16.652 --> 07:18.652
You know what
that means.

07:18.654 --> 07:22.590
I helped you,
now you help me.

07:22.592 --> 07:25.693
Time for a little
family reunion.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.394
Elena: What does Matt
want with Stefan?

07:27.396 --> 07:28.929
I don't know.
It's Matt.

07:28.931 --> 07:32.666
Food, money,
new social class.

07:32.668 --> 07:34.535
Whatever it is,
it better distract Stefan

07:34.537 --> 07:36.670
from his sizeable
screw-up with Caroline.

07:36.672 --> 07:39.106
Did you know about that,
how she felt about him?

07:39.108 --> 07:41.909
She told me
a little while back,

07:41.911 --> 07:43.644
and whatever
you're thinking,

07:43.646 --> 07:45.646
I want both of them
to be happy.

07:45.648 --> 07:49.683
Even if she compels away
all the things she likes about him?

07:49.685 --> 07:51.852
Hey.

07:51.854 --> 07:53.220
Thanks
for doing this.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.888
Don't worry about.
I needed an excuse

07:54.890 --> 07:56.624
to get out of that
frat house.

07:56.626 --> 07:59.193
Way too much boy.
Gross.

07:59.195 --> 08:00.361
You got everything?

08:00.363 --> 08:02.229
Yep. Blood
from a Bennett--

08:02.231 --> 08:03.631
Lucy to be exact--

08:03.633 --> 08:05.499
and an Ascendant
from whatever the hell

08:05.501 --> 08:06.767
your last name is.

08:06.769 --> 08:09.203
Parker.

08:09.205 --> 08:11.071
So this is
the famous Ascendant?

08:11.073 --> 08:12.239
Yup.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.775
Surprised that Jo
gave it up.

08:14.777 --> 08:16.543
Why?

08:16.545 --> 08:19.213
It's the only thing
keeping Kai locked in his prison.

08:19.215 --> 08:22.016
If he gets out,
he's coming after Jo.

08:22.018 --> 08:26.553
Well, good old Jo--
heh heh--helping us out.

08:26.555 --> 08:28.389
Can we do this, please?

08:28.391 --> 08:30.724
Whatever. So I'm gonna
need the moon

08:30.726 --> 08:32.592
to activate
the Ascendant.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.261
It will be viable
for about 8 hours,

08:35.264 --> 08:37.765
so once I send you over,
the clock's ticking.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.400
And how do we
get back?

08:39.402 --> 08:40.601
Drink these.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.068
What is that?

08:42.071 --> 08:43.504
It's my blood.
It will link you to me

08:43.506 --> 08:44.938
so I can find you
and bring you back.

08:44.940 --> 08:48.208
Give this one
to Bonnie, too.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.310
Are you waiting
for a toast?

08:50.312 --> 08:51.779
Drink.

08:54.583 --> 08:58.285
Mmm. Bitter.
Wonder why.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.720
Shall we?

09:08.130 --> 09:10.597
[Chanting]

09:20.476 --> 09:22.543
Hey.

09:22.545 --> 09:24.211
I used to come here
every day

09:24.213 --> 09:28.315
after the accident
for months.

09:28.317 --> 09:31.318
This is where your
parents are buried.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.921
Yeah, but not in 1994.

09:33.923 --> 09:36.957
In 1994, they were
still alive.

09:36.959 --> 09:41.595
Yeah. So is Bonnie.

09:41.597 --> 09:44.732
So let's go get her.

09:44.734 --> 09:46.567
Just keep your
eyes peeled.

09:46.569 --> 09:48.435
There's a pork rind-munching freak
somewhere around here.

09:48.437 --> 09:49.636
Ok?

09:49.638 --> 09:50.838
Yeah.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.239
Come on.

09:53.809 --> 09:56.643
[Music playing]

09:57.446 --> 10:00.214

to that guy on the plane.

have you flown recently?

with the whole liquid situation

about terrorists.

a great punch line to a joke.

So after the third group home,

I got myself
emancipated,

difficult, by the way.

34:35.027 --> 34:38.962
No matter. I'll find out
sooner or later.

34:47.039 --> 34:48.571
Bonnie's gonna get
to the house,

34:48.572 --> 34:52.742
and we will be gone.

34:52.744 --> 34:57.480
Until the next comet
or full moon or eclipse.

34:57.482 --> 34:58.948
As long as we have that,
we can go back

34:58.950 --> 35:03.453
as many times as we need
until we get her back.

35:03.455 --> 35:05.989
Wait. Are you guys
talking about Bonnie Bennett?

35:05.991 --> 35:08.925
Because honestly, I didn't think she
was all that great.

35:11.530 --> 35:12.996
No!

35:15.434 --> 35:17.934
I am gonna enjoy
the hell out of this.

35:21.707 --> 35:24.340
Oh, hey. Me, too.

35:24.342 --> 35:28.178
Oh, yeah. Damon,
I, uh, I stole some of Liv's magic

35:28.180 --> 35:29.612
when I tried
to kill her.

35:29.614 --> 35:31.881
Think some of it might
still be in my system,

35:31.883 --> 35:34.784
so pardon me.

35:34.786 --> 35:36.252
Unh!

35:40.959 --> 35:44.160
Uh-uh-uh.

35:44.162 --> 35:45.962
You missed one.

35:45.964 --> 35:48.131
Phesmatos incendia.

35:48.133 --> 35:49.632
Aah!

35:52.170 --> 35:54.137
No!

35:54.139 --> 35:55.839
Aah!

36:04.516 --> 36:05.982
Unh!

36:10.388 --> 36:12.355
Elena: Oh, God.

36:12.357 --> 36:14.591
You ok?

36:14.593 --> 36:16.459
Huh.

36:16.461 --> 36:18.862
I guess this
is that, uh,

36:18.864 --> 36:20.830
antimagic border,

36:20.832 --> 36:24.634
which means now there's
a psycho loose in Mystic Falls

36:24.636 --> 36:28.505
and no vampires
around to stop him.

36:28.507 --> 36:29.973
Whoops.

36:41.106 --> 36:43.807
Look. I'm sorry that
Enzo killed her. He's--

36:43.809 --> 36:46.309
A monster.
Yeah, I know,

36:46.311 --> 36:48.578
but you could have
stopped him, and you didn't.

36:50.849 --> 36:52.916
What, you think that
was easy for me,

36:52.918 --> 36:54.451
watching
an innocent girl die?

36:54.453 --> 36:56.053
I don't know
actually.

36:56.055 --> 36:58.088
You're not exactly
the sharing type.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.023
Matt, I promise you
that everything I do

37:00.025 --> 37:01.992
I have thought out
over and over,

37:01.994 --> 37:03.660
making sure it's
the right thing to do.

37:03.662 --> 37:05.595
So we're just supposed
to trust that you know best?

37:05.597 --> 37:09.666
No. You're supposed
to trust that I'm nothing like Enzo.

37:09.668 --> 37:12.335
The problem is you are
because no matter

37:12.337 --> 37:14.037
how close vampires
get to humans,

37:14.039 --> 37:16.640
our lives will always
mean less,

37:16.642 --> 37:20.310
so when push comes to shove,
we'll be on opposite sides,

37:20.312 --> 37:22.913
which is what Tripp knew
and I didn't.

37:28.721 --> 37:30.520
[Truck starts]

37:42.634 --> 37:44.768
[Cell phone ringing]

37:48.440 --> 37:49.639
Elena: Jeremy?

37:49.641 --> 37:54.077
Let me guess.
She's not with you?

37:54.079 --> 37:56.980
She was on her way,
but--

37:56.982 --> 37:58.715
but at the last minute,
something went wrong,

37:58.717 --> 38:01.284
and it didn't work.

38:01.286 --> 38:03.954
I bet Damon's fine,
isn't he?

38:17.035 --> 38:19.603
Don't do that.

38:19.605 --> 38:20.904
Why not?

38:20.906 --> 38:22.506
Because I think
channeling your rage

38:22.508 --> 38:24.407
might be
a better option.

38:24.409 --> 38:28.278
How do you feel about
being a hunter again?

38:28.280 --> 38:29.613
Why?

38:29.615 --> 38:32.282
Because I want you
to help me kill Enzo.

38:39.458 --> 38:42.759
So Jo drove me
across the border.

38:42.761 --> 38:44.594
I told her
she was crazy,

38:44.596 --> 38:45.796
that you'd never
compel me.

38:45.798 --> 38:48.331
Look, Ric.

38:48.333 --> 38:51.968
[Music playing]

38:51.970 --> 38:53.303
We had to get
Bonnie back.

38:53.305 --> 38:56.673
Getting Bonnie back was
never off the table.

38:56.675 --> 38:58.275
What was off the table
was compelling me to

38:58.277 --> 39:00.510
steal from my girlfriend
when we had promised her

39:00.512 --> 39:02.312
we'd keep her brother
locked way.

39:02.314 --> 39:06.216
- Yeah, I know.
- Where is he--Kai?

39:06.218 --> 39:08.618
He's out,
but it's not our fa--

39:31.510 --> 39:36.680
I left Bonnie a note
at the house.

39:36.682 --> 39:39.182
I told her we would be
on your front porch.

39:44.556 --> 39:45.755
She'd probably be
there now

39:45.757 --> 39:47.858
with about
a half an hour to spare.

39:50.395 --> 39:52.562
She sacrificed
everything for us

39:52.564 --> 39:55.732
over and over again,
and then we were

39:55.734 --> 39:57.367
supposed to be there
for her.

40:02.407 --> 40:04.140
She's all alone.

40:04.142 --> 40:06.977
[Music continues]

41:05.771 --> 41:07.938
I think gin gets
a bad rap.

41:15.113 --> 41:17.781
I'd rather not
kill you,

41:17.783 --> 41:19.449
but I will.

41:23.322 --> 41:26.022
What the hell
do you want?

41:26.024 --> 41:28.858
This is gonna
sound crazy,

41:28.860 --> 41:30.961
but I'm want to save
Liv's life.

41:34.799 --> 41:37.166
Feel like making
a deal with the devil?
