00:08.000 --> 00:12.724
Captain, Starfleet have reported
a disturbance in the Neutral Zone.

00:12.891 --> 00:14.145
Of what nature?

00:15.274 --> 00:19.037
A battle. Quadrant nine,
coordinates 070, mark three.

00:19.204 --> 00:21.211
There's no information
who was involved.

00:21.377 --> 00:23.761
- They ask if we can investigate.
- Answer yes.

00:23.928 --> 00:26.310
- Mr. La Forge, lay in the course.
- Aye, sir.

00:26.478 --> 00:29.571
No reports of any Federation vessels
in that area.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.787
- Ferengi?
- Out of their territory.

00:31.955 --> 00:35.173
- Shall we separate the saucer?
- Let's get more information first.

00:35.340 --> 00:37.054
Course set, Captain.

00:37.222 --> 00:39.479
- Speed, warp seven.
- Aye, sir, warp seven.

00:39.646 --> 00:40.984
Engage.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.889 --> 00:52.355
We are now approaching
the Neutral Zone.

00:52.522 --> 00:56.870
Sir, sensors indicate recent photon
explosions and phaser activity.

00:57.038 --> 00:59.503
I've analyzed the explosions'
residue.

00:59.671 --> 01:04.604
This is of no known Ferengi design.
It is possibly Romulan.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.447
There's a name
we haven't heard for a while.

01:07.614 --> 01:09.621
I could go longer without hearing it.

01:09.788 --> 01:12.714
If they have returned to this sector,
we should know.

01:12.881 --> 01:15.557
- Mr. Worf, any further activity?
- Negative, sir.

01:16.226 --> 01:19.445
- Slow to half impulse.
- Going to one-half impulse.

01:24.503 --> 01:27.012
Now entering quadrant 907,
mark three.

01:27.178 --> 01:29.938
Shields and deflectors up.
Go to yellow alert.

01:30.105 --> 01:33.366
I have located a vessel, sir.
It is drifting.

01:34.621 --> 01:37.045
- Put it on main viewer.
- Aye, sir.

01:39.929 --> 01:41.309
Magnify.

01:43.483 --> 01:45.740
Their life-support systems
are failing.

01:45.908 --> 01:49.085
Propulsion, navigation,
and all communication inoperative.

01:49.252 --> 01:51.342
- Any trace of the other vessel?
- No, sir.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.516
If it is Romulan
it could be cloaked.

01:53.684 --> 01:55.941
Tell Starfleet
we're entering the Neutral Zone.

01:56.108 --> 01:59.160
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. La Forge, take us in closer.

01:59.704 --> 02:00.665
Aye, sir.

02:01.836 --> 02:03.382
Stay sharp, everyone.

02:13.917 --> 02:15.297
It's Talarian.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.732
- Life signs?
- Nothing yet, sir.

02:20.899 --> 02:26.041
I have identified the vessel.
The Batris, a general cargo vessel.

02:26.208 --> 02:28.256
A long way from home.

02:28.423 --> 02:29.719
Keep alert.

02:33.147 --> 02:35.363
Captain, possible life signs.

02:35.531 --> 02:37.035
What do you mean, "possible"?

02:37.203 --> 02:40.338
The readings emanate
from what's left of Main Engineering.

02:40.505 --> 02:45.480
Radioactive clutter is making
positive determination difficult.

02:45.647 --> 02:47.403
I'll prepare an away team.

02:47.571 --> 02:51.793
Lt. Yar, stay at your post. If this
is the result of a Romulan attack,

02:51.960 --> 02:53.716
they may still be in the area.

02:53.883 --> 02:57.269
- Aye, sir.
- Data, Geordi, let's go.

02:57.897 --> 03:02.495
Mr. La Forge, are we close enough
to use a Visual Acuity Transmitter?

03:02.662 --> 03:05.714
- We can certainly try it, sir.
- Please do.

03:06.759 --> 03:07.888
And, Number One...?

03:09.685 --> 03:12.236
Everything about this seems wrong.

03:12.402 --> 03:15.287
Agreed. It smells like a trap.
Let's go.

03:37.152 --> 03:40.245
Space, the final frontier.

03:41.959 --> 03:45.889
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:46.056 --> 03:50.153
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

03:51.992 --> 03:55.672
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

03:56.591 --> 04:00.269
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:03.100 --> 05:08.032
Captain's log, star date 41503.7.
We have entered the Neutral Zone,

05:08.199 --> 05:11.960
where a Talarian freighter
has been severely damaged in battle.

05:12.126 --> 05:14.258
I have sent an away team
to investigate.

05:14.425 --> 05:16.849
What exactly does this device do?

05:17.016 --> 05:20.109
We've been working on a way
to transmit what my visor sees.

05:20.275 --> 05:22.573
If it works, the bridge
will be able to monitor us.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.078
It has restrictions.

05:24.245 --> 05:28.507
The information from Geordi's visor
is difficult to encode.

05:28.675 --> 05:30.763
The signal breaks down easily.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.146
- So not much range?
- Exactly.

05:33.313 --> 05:37.325
The effective range is only a few
kilometers, but we're working on it.

05:37.701 --> 05:40.584
- La Forge to bridge.
- This is the bridge.

05:40.751 --> 05:43.049
Worf, I've switched on
the transmitter.

05:43.216 --> 05:46.601
We are receiving.
The signal is strong.

05:46.769 --> 05:49.526
OK, Worf,
I'm switching off for transport.

05:56.672 --> 06:00.349
Set phasers on stun.
Let's be ready for anything.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.650
Energize.

06:16.312 --> 06:19.989
- La Forge to bridge.
- This is the Enterprise.

06:20.156 --> 06:22.998
Captain,
I'm switching on the transmitter.

06:23.165 --> 06:26.048
Ready to receive. On main viewer.

06:26.214 --> 06:27.176
Aye, sir.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.547
Extraordinary!

06:51.245 --> 06:53.501
Now I'm beginning to understand him.

06:57.346 --> 06:59.143
Geordi, what's that?

06:59.310 --> 07:01.818
- Over to the left.
- What?

07:01.985 --> 07:03.991
Yes, that. No, no, back.

07:05.035 --> 07:08.921
Yes, that. Right there.
What is that?

07:10.216 --> 07:11.804
That's Cmdr Riker.

07:13.350 --> 07:21.248
To me it's just an undefined form
standing in a... visual frenzy.

07:21.415 --> 07:25.928
Can you... filter out
the extraneous information?

07:26.096 --> 07:31.277
- No, I get it all simultaneously.
- But it's... just a jumble.

07:31.444 --> 07:33.408
How can you make head or tail
of that?

07:33.575 --> 07:37.419
I select what I want
and then... disregard the rest.

07:37.586 --> 07:39.760
But how is that possible?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.765
How, in a noisy room,

07:41.933 --> 07:45.734
can you select
one specific voice or sound?

07:45.902 --> 07:48.870
- Of course, something you learn.
- Exactly.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.797
It's something I've learned.
Does that make it more clear?

07:52.964 --> 07:54.093
Look over at Data.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.157
There's an aura around him.

08:02.325 --> 08:05.292
Well, of course, he's an android.

08:05.459 --> 08:09.679
You say that as if you think
that's what we all see.

08:09.846 --> 08:11.225
Don't you?

08:11.392 --> 08:14.903
Sir, I hate to break this up, but...

08:16.240 --> 08:20.920
Yes, of course, Number One.
Proceed.

08:22.423 --> 08:23.386
Let's go.

09:22.890 --> 09:25.564
I am detecting high levels
of deuterium gas,

09:25.689 --> 09:28.029
probably from leakage
in the drive system.

09:28.196 --> 09:30.453
- Toxic?
- Not as yet, sir.

09:36.596 --> 09:40.064
The life signs are emanating
from the far side of Engineering.

09:40.231 --> 09:44.368
- What's the safest way around?
- All routes are equally dangerous.

09:44.535 --> 09:46.792
What's the least dangerous?

09:46.958 --> 09:49.048
There is no significant difference.

09:51.722 --> 09:53.310
Steady on.

10:11.864 --> 10:13.870
Cmdr Riker!

10:15.291 --> 10:17.464
- Commander!
- Yes, Geordi?

10:17.630 --> 10:20.513
There's a fissure in the bulkhead.

10:20.681 --> 10:23.899
The skin of the ship
is losing its integrity.

10:24.107 --> 10:26.866
- Where is it? I can't see it.
- Right there.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.507
Geordi, step closer.

10:39.150 --> 10:42.994
It looks to me like a spectrograph
indicating metal fatigue.

10:43.162 --> 10:47.091
- Is that how you interpret it?
- Very good, Captain. Exactly right.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.433
How long before this hull ruptures?

10:50.600 --> 10:56.284
It's impossible to be exact.
I'd say five minutes. Probably less.

10:56.910 --> 10:58.164
Let's go.

11:14.503 --> 11:16.467
Geordi, we've lost transmission.

11:16.634 --> 11:20.478
Signal overload.
I'm surprised it lasted this long.

11:30.632 --> 11:32.805
We've reached the core, Captain.

11:32.972 --> 11:37.151
The life signs are very strong, sir.
They are coming from over there.

11:37.318 --> 11:41.414
- Is there any other way around?
- Negative. This is the only way.

11:41.581 --> 11:44.337
The safest way to proceed
is for me to cross alone.

11:44.505 --> 11:47.472
The heat and toxic gases
have less effect on me.

11:48.392 --> 11:49.352
Agreed.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.100
Captain, Data's gone ahead.

12:03.267 --> 12:06.361
The life signs are from
the far side of Engineering.

12:12.293 --> 12:15.762
I've found them, sir. The door
to their compartment is jammed.

12:26.292 --> 12:29.592
The control mechanism's
not operative, sir.

12:34.900 --> 12:37.951
This is Cmdr Riker
of the USS Enterprise.

12:38.118 --> 12:39.496
Do you hear me?

12:42.464 --> 12:46.141
I advise against the use of phasers.
The gas build-up is too great.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.651
A phaser discharge now
could blow us all outta here.

12:49.818 --> 12:51.239
Shall l, sir?

12:51.824 --> 12:56.379
- What's going on?
- We're about to force the door.

13:15.852 --> 13:18.024
What is it? What do you see?

13:18.191 --> 13:19.529
Klingons.

13:19.696 --> 13:21.367
Klingons?

13:27.134 --> 13:30.477
- I am Korris.
- We'll handle the formalities later.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.861
We have to get off this ship.
Are there any other survivors?

13:34.279 --> 13:35.742
No.

13:37.163 --> 13:40.422
I believe I've found
a quicker way out of here, sir.

13:41.383 --> 13:42.344
Check him out.

13:46.231 --> 13:47.944
He is alive, sir, but just barely.

13:48.110 --> 13:49.950
Then pick up the body and let's go.

13:50.116 --> 13:51.078
No!

13:53.167 --> 13:56.342
- I will carry him.
- As you wish.

13:56.510 --> 13:58.515
Come on, let's go!

13:59.937 --> 14:02.193
Tasha, go to transporter room three.

14:02.777 --> 14:05.160
I want you there
when the away team returns.

14:05.326 --> 14:06.289
Aye, sir.

14:16.442 --> 14:19.785
Commander, we are out of time!
This ship is blowing!

14:21.039 --> 14:23.503
Transporter room,
have you got a lock on us?

14:23.671 --> 14:27.475
Too much interference.
Get further away from Engineering.

14:27.642 --> 14:31.361
Sir, Engineering is critical.
Destruction is imminent.

14:31.527 --> 14:33.199
There are no options! Do it!

14:33.366 --> 14:34.328
Now!

15:23.594 --> 15:25.934
Bridge, this is Cmdr Riker.

15:26.102 --> 15:29.026
We are taking the survivors
to sickbay.

15:31.701 --> 15:36.088
- I'll be in sickbay.
- Request permission to join you.

15:36.924 --> 15:37.885
Granted.

15:44.487 --> 15:48.165
- The debris is still being analyzed.
- Inform me when it's completed.

15:48.331 --> 15:49.752
Aye, sir.

15:53.137 --> 15:56.898
- Situation, Doctor?
- His injuries are very critical.

16:02.916 --> 16:05.214
I'm Jean-Luc Picard,
Captain of this vessel.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.887
I am Korris, Captain
of the Klingon Defence Force.

16:08.055 --> 16:09.685
This is Lt. Konmel.

16:10.604 --> 16:12.777
Would you mind
telling me what has happened?

16:12.944 --> 16:17.707
We were passengers. The Talarians
were taking us to Outpost MZ5.

16:17.875 --> 16:20.550
What was the vessel
doing in the Neutral Zone?

16:20.675 --> 16:23.850
We were attacked without warning
by a Ferengi cruiser.

16:24.017 --> 16:28.029
During battle we must have
entered the Neutral Zone.

16:28.195 --> 16:31.330
The weapons were not Ferengi.

16:31.497 --> 16:33.252
What is your name?

16:33.795 --> 16:35.759
I am Lt. Worf.

16:36.471 --> 16:39.020
And you are a member of this crew?

16:39.187 --> 16:41.193
Yes.

16:41.359 --> 16:43.156
You are correct.

16:43.324 --> 16:46.415
The weapons were Klingon,
but the vessel was Ferengi.

16:46.582 --> 16:51.137
- What precipitated the attack?
- I don't know. We were in quarters.

16:51.304 --> 16:54.313
The Captain of the freighter
had no combat experience,

16:54.480 --> 16:57.781
so did not anticipate the
first attack, which was nearly fatal.

16:57.948 --> 17:00.288
We took control with his permission.

17:00.455 --> 17:02.796
The Ferengi called for surrender.

17:02.963 --> 17:05.887
I told the Captain
to agree to all their terms.

17:06.055 --> 17:10.694
We had only one chance, but I was
confident that it would be enough.

17:10.861 --> 17:14.663
As adversaries the Ferengi
are not very worthy.

17:14.830 --> 17:18.674
Still, your weapons were limited
and their vessel superior.

17:18.842 --> 17:24.023
Yes. All we had was a battery
of ancient Merculite rockets.

17:24.191 --> 17:27.241
Our only chance was to trick them
into lowering their shields.

17:27.407 --> 17:29.581
We reduced power and lured them in.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.587
They suspected nothing.

17:31.755 --> 17:35.181
When they lowered their shields
to beam over a boarding party,

17:35.348 --> 17:36.852
we opened fire.

17:37.019 --> 17:39.568
There are some points
that I'm not clear about.

17:39.735 --> 17:43.287
Captain,... we are hungry and tired.

17:43.956 --> 17:44.917
Of course.

17:45.085 --> 17:49.472
If there is anything else you wish
to know, we will be available.

17:49.639 --> 17:53.065
Permission to show our guests
to their quarters, Captain.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.611
Permission granted.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.980
What do you think, Captain?

18:07.148 --> 18:09.571
There's more to this
than we've been told.

18:10.574 --> 18:13.332
Why was that Talarian ship
so far off course?

18:13.499 --> 18:15.839
What was its point of departure?

18:16.006 --> 18:20.101
Why would Klingon officers hitch
a ride on a broken-down freighter?

18:21.021 --> 18:24.322
Find out what Starfleet knows
about Korris and company.

18:24.489 --> 18:27.539
It'll take 48 hours
for a message to get to Starfleet.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.841
They'll be here for a while.
Let's find out all we can about them.

18:32.428 --> 18:35.479
Should I have assigned a security
team to keep an eye on them?

18:35.646 --> 18:38.195
No. Worf can deal with
anything that might arise.

18:38.362 --> 18:43.335
- How's your patient, Doctor?
- Not good. I'll keep you posted.

18:55.747 --> 18:57.626
Sit, friend. Let us eat.

19:08.616 --> 19:13.004
I did not know there were Klingons
serving on human Starfleet vessels.

19:13.171 --> 19:16.472
As far as I know, I am the only one.

19:17.350 --> 19:22.029
Tell me, what is it like for the
hunter to lie down with the prey?

19:22.950 --> 19:26.793
Have they tamed you?
Or have you always been docile?

19:27.546 --> 19:31.975
Does it make you gentle?
Is your heart filled with peace?

19:32.143 --> 19:35.903
Do glorious battles
no longer inspire your dreams?

19:37.072 --> 19:41.669
Why do you mock me?
Why do you wish to anger me?

19:41.836 --> 19:44.343
Only to see if it is still possible.

19:45.346 --> 19:46.308
It is.

19:51.740 --> 19:53.536
Dr. Crusher!

19:53.704 --> 19:55.667
You'd better come and look at this.

19:55.835 --> 19:59.553
- His condition is worsening.
- He's convulsing. Get the hypospray!

20:09.708 --> 20:12.383
Cmdr Korris, this is Capt Picard.

20:13.343 --> 20:14.681
Yes, Captain?

20:14.849 --> 20:17.230
I'm sorry to report
your comrade's injuries

20:17.398 --> 20:19.445
are beyond our medical abilities.

20:29.015 --> 20:30.602
He's dying.

21:30.523 --> 21:34.077
Is there any special arrangement
you would like for the body?

21:35.831 --> 21:38.338
It is only an empty shell now.

21:39.425 --> 21:41.682
Please, treat it as such.

21:56.766 --> 21:59.692
Kunivas's killer
should have been an enemy,

21:59.859 --> 22:02.073
then his death
would have been more glorious.

22:02.240 --> 22:06.335
If the opponent was not an enemy,
who was it?

22:07.212 --> 22:09.385
Tell me. What really happened?

22:09.553 --> 22:11.726
I do not wish to anger you.

22:11.893 --> 22:16.155
We are, after all,
brothers lost among infidels.

22:17.284 --> 22:20.794
Tell me,
how is it that you come to this ship?

22:20.960 --> 22:22.966
That uniform?

22:23.133 --> 22:25.014
Through an act of kindness.

22:25.181 --> 22:30.070
The Romulans attacked the Khitomer
outpost. Everyone was killed.

22:30.238 --> 22:33.247
I was buried under the rubble
and left for dead.

22:33.413 --> 22:36.756
A human Starfleet officer found me.

22:36.923 --> 22:42.147
He took me to his home on Gault and
told his wife to raise me as his son.

22:42.314 --> 22:44.445
How old were you?

22:44.612 --> 22:47.036
Before the Age of Inclusion.

22:49.041 --> 22:50.421
That young?

22:50.588 --> 22:53.429
Gault is a farming colony!

22:57.023 --> 23:00.617
When my foster brother and I were
of age, we entered Starfleet Academy.

23:00.784 --> 23:03.918
He hated it and returned to Gault.
I stayed.

23:04.084 --> 23:07.345
You haven't spent much time
among your own kind.

23:07.512 --> 23:08.974
Hardly none.

23:09.141 --> 23:12.985
So, when the night
was still and quiet,

23:13.487 --> 23:17.581
and the sound of the blood
in your veins filled your ears,

23:17.749 --> 23:21.260
the only way to silence it
was to slip out into the night,

23:21.426 --> 23:23.391
and like the hunter that spawned you,

23:23.558 --> 23:26.942
join in the struggle
of life and death.

23:27.695 --> 23:30.911
- You were unable...
- The others did not understand.

23:31.079 --> 23:33.920
- You frightened them.
- They shunned you.

23:34.088 --> 23:38.099
Cursed you, called you vile names,
and you knew not why.

23:38.601 --> 23:41.401
Even now,
do you know why you are driven?

23:41.568 --> 23:47.961
Why you cannot relent, or repent,
or confess, or abstain?

23:49.423 --> 23:51.220
How could you know?

23:51.805 --> 23:55.651
There have been no other Klingons
to lead you to that knowledge.

23:55.816 --> 23:57.530
Yes.

23:57.697 --> 24:01.291
Yes, those feelings
are still a part of me.

24:05.469 --> 24:07.225
But I control them.

24:07.392 --> 24:09.399
They do not rule me.

24:11.946 --> 24:17.337
Yes. To fit in, the humans demand
that you change the one thing

24:17.504 --> 24:23.939
that you cannot change.
But because you cannot,

24:24.107 --> 24:28.954
you do.
That too is the mark of a warrior.

24:30.207 --> 24:33.258
You said I mock you. I do not.

24:33.843 --> 24:35.306
I salute you!

24:35.473 --> 24:37.562
Against whom do you test yourself?

24:37.729 --> 24:41.531
- What enemy do you battle?
- I have been in battle.

24:41.698 --> 24:44.415
- Then, you understand.
- Yes, I do.

24:44.582 --> 24:47.926
Brother, this "peace",
this "Alliance",

24:48.092 --> 24:51.394
is like a living death
to warriors like us.

24:51.978 --> 24:55.363
You're right,
we lied to your Commander.

24:55.531 --> 24:58.623
We commandeered that freighter
and left the crew behind.

24:58.790 --> 25:03.429
We were in search of a place
where we can live like true Klingons!

25:03.595 --> 25:05.978
You did not battle the Ferengi?

25:06.145 --> 25:08.693
It was one of our own cruisers
sent to bring us back.

25:09.404 --> 25:12.078
You destroyed a Klingon vessel?!

25:12.203 --> 25:15.881
I did not want to battle
our brothers. I had no choice.

25:16.047 --> 25:20.058
They had been corrupted
by the illusion of peace.

25:20.226 --> 25:24.489
They traded our birthright
so they could die in their sleep.

25:24.655 --> 25:28.709
A peace that makes the Klingon heart
that beats within my chest

25:28.877 --> 25:31.133
wither and die!

25:35.019 --> 25:38.696
Is it permitted for you
to show us around this ship?

25:39.908 --> 25:41.914
Yes, of course.

25:53.155 --> 25:55.620
And as I watched Worf,...

25:55.787 --> 25:58.753
..it was like looking at a man
that I had never known.

26:00.342 --> 26:04.981
Captain, long-range sensors
indicate another vessel approaching.

26:05.148 --> 26:08.364
- Can you identify it?
- No, sir, not yet.

26:08.532 --> 26:10.245
Keep a close watch on it.

26:10.412 --> 26:13.213
So close to the Neutral Zone
it can't be random.

26:14.716 --> 26:17.683
Let's look at that sensory data.

26:19.103 --> 26:23.742
What magnificent battles we could
have at the helm of this ship.

26:24.662 --> 26:28.840
Perhaps your dreams of glory
no longer fit the time.

26:29.007 --> 26:31.557
They belong buried with the past.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.064
Standing here we will never know.

26:34.231 --> 26:38.117
Our answer lies out there.
Our instincts will lead us.

26:38.285 --> 26:42.087
Instincts not dulled
by living among civilized men.

26:44.343 --> 26:46.391
I believe, sir,
that was the first time

26:46.558 --> 26:49.357
outsiders have witnessed
the Klingon death ritual.

26:50.612 --> 26:53.787
I can understand them looking
at a dying man's eyes,

26:53.954 --> 26:55.167
but the howling?

26:55.333 --> 26:56.921
It was a warning.

26:57.088 --> 26:58.091
To who?

26:58.258 --> 27:00.096
They're warning the dead, sir.

27:00.264 --> 27:04.360
"Beware, a Klingon warrior
is about to arrive."

27:07.493 --> 27:11.253
Captain, that unidentified vessel
is approaching us at warp five.

27:11.421 --> 27:14.472
Intersect one hour, 16 minutes,
33 seconds.

27:14.639 --> 27:17.648
- Can we get a visual?
- I can try, sir.

27:23.372 --> 27:25.043
Magnify.

27:29.431 --> 27:31.186
Hello.

27:33.359 --> 27:34.947
Klingons.

27:35.114 --> 27:38.916
- Open hailing frequencies, Lt. Yar.
- Hailing frequencies open.

27:39.794 --> 27:43.472
Klingon cruiser, this is Jean-Luc
Picard of the USS Enterprise.

27:43.638 --> 27:47.107
I am Cmdr K'nera.
What is your purpose in this area?

27:47.275 --> 27:50.658
We came to investigate a battle.
We rescued three Klingon survivors.

27:50.826 --> 27:54.378
That is all that is left
of the crew of the cruiser T'Acog?

27:54.544 --> 27:59.183
They're from the freighter Batris.
Their leader is Capt Korris.

27:59.351 --> 28:02.025
You have him on your ship?
He is alive?

28:02.192 --> 28:04.323
- Yes.
- He is a criminal.

28:04.491 --> 28:07.708
A renegade, who with two others
stole that freighter

28:07.875 --> 28:11.511
and destroyed the Klingon cruiser
sent to bring them back.

28:11.678 --> 28:14.728
We expect the criminals
to be delivered into our custody

28:14.895 --> 28:18.029
as soon as we
are within transporter range.

28:20.161 --> 28:23.253
Lt. Yar, where are they now?

28:24.255 --> 28:26.137
They're with Worf on deck 17.

28:26.303 --> 28:29.813
- Deck 17?
- Yes. Near the battle-bridge lift.

28:29.981 --> 28:31.694
Shall I alert Lt. Worf?

28:31.861 --> 28:33.699
No, send a security team.

28:33.867 --> 28:36.373
Worf wouldn't allow them
on the battle bridge.

28:36.541 --> 28:38.839
I think we cannot assume anything.

28:39.007 --> 28:42.725
Shall I remain at my tactical
position or lead the team?

28:42.893 --> 28:45.651
Lead the team. And, Lieutenant,...

28:45.818 --> 28:48.200
you understand
with whom you're dealing?

28:49.118 --> 28:50.080
Aye, sir.

28:54.217 --> 28:57.853
We have heard this ship
can separate in time of battle.

28:58.019 --> 28:59.775
Yes. When relieved of its bulk

28:59.942 --> 29:03.368
the Enterprise becomes
an exceptional weapon.

29:07.755 --> 29:10.723
- They have come for us.
- Step aside.

29:12.687 --> 29:14.442
What is the problem?

29:14.609 --> 29:17.325
The Captain wants those two
taken into custody.

29:17.492 --> 29:19.247
Do not let them take us, Worf.

29:19.414 --> 29:22.131
- Help us.
- Listen to the voice of your blood.

29:22.298 --> 29:24.304
You are not of these people.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.034
Yes. Join us.

29:48.958 --> 29:50.461
Go back!

29:50.629 --> 29:53.596
Please, turn around
and go back to your mother.

29:56.229 --> 30:00.031
Bridge, we have a hostage situation
on deck 17.

30:13.612 --> 30:14.573
Mommy!

30:18.083 --> 30:20.632
Bridge, this is Lt. Yar.

30:21.133 --> 30:24.393
Disregard.
Situation is under control.

30:31.371 --> 30:34.505
By order of the Captain,
you are confined to Security.

30:47.835 --> 30:49.924
I thought for a minute
we had a problem.

30:51.472 --> 30:55.065
Yes. It looked like Korris
was going to hold that girl hostage.

30:55.231 --> 30:56.944
That is not our way.

30:57.112 --> 31:00.998
Cowards take hostages,
Klingons do not.

31:45.752 --> 31:46.922
Lieutenant.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.271
The Klingon vessel has arrived.

31:52.438 --> 31:54.528
They request
the return of the renegades.

31:56.617 --> 31:59.917
- They will be tried and executed.
- I know.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.174
Lieutenant, I am not unmindful

32:02.341 --> 32:05.685
of the mixed feelings
you must have about this incident.

32:06.728 --> 32:08.066
Thank you, sir.

32:10.992 --> 32:15.044
- Are there no other options, sir?
- None that I can see.

32:24.112 --> 32:26.913
- He seems to be handling this well.
- So far.

32:29.879 --> 32:32.428
He must be torn.
These are his people.

32:32.595 --> 32:36.606
The Klingon vessel is within range.
They're requesting visual contact.

32:36.774 --> 32:40.493
- Open frequencies.
- Hailing frequencies open, sir.

32:42.499 --> 32:45.758
We are in position now
to receive the criminals.

32:47.011 --> 32:48.724
We're prepared to transfer.

32:48.892 --> 32:50.897
Captain.

32:51.943 --> 32:54.951
Request permission to address
the Captain on the Klingon vessel.

32:57.458 --> 33:01.011
I know it is against procedure,
but there is something I must say.

33:01.971 --> 33:03.977
Permission granted.

33:20.148 --> 33:22.154
What is it you want?

33:22.572 --> 33:24.452
To plead.

33:24.620 --> 33:26.291
You waste your time.

33:26.458 --> 33:29.342
Their actions
threaten the Alliance.

33:29.509 --> 33:31.765
They disobeyed
and must be punished.

33:31.933 --> 33:35.025
Yes, they must be punished,...

33:35.192 --> 33:38.242
but not executed with dishonour.

33:38.410 --> 33:40.624
Why do you care?

33:42.587 --> 33:47.017
What burns in their eyes,...
fires my soul.

33:47.728 --> 33:52.031
I hear their words
and I see it all as it was.

33:52.743 --> 33:55.584
Part of me longs for that time.

33:55.751 --> 33:59.136
It's bred in the bone. We all do.

34:00.181 --> 34:02.645
Then send them to a planet
in the Halee system

34:02.812 --> 34:05.738
where they can meet death
on their feet with a weapon in hand,

34:05.905 --> 34:07.702
not tied and helpless.

34:07.869 --> 34:12.884
When one of us dies that way,
it diminishes us all.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.596
Yes.

34:14.764 --> 34:18.274
Brother, I feel as you.

34:18.440 --> 34:22.745
I too wish they could fly free,
but I have no choice.

34:24.081 --> 34:25.460
Sir.

34:25.628 --> 34:28.929
We await the transfer.

34:34.779 --> 34:38.373
Lt. Yar, escort the prisoners
to the transporter room.

34:38.541 --> 34:39.710
Aye, sir.

35:33.324 --> 35:36.708
This is Ramos. Force field
in Security three has been broken.

36:06.084 --> 36:08.215
Lt. Yar to bridge.
There's been an escape.

36:08.382 --> 36:11.851
At least one of my security is dead.
So is Konmel.

36:12.018 --> 36:14.608
- Korris is loose and armed.
- Keep me informed.

36:14.775 --> 36:16.113
Aye, sir.

36:22.172 --> 36:23.801
Data, visual on K'nera.

36:24.345 --> 36:26.141
Visual on, sir.

36:29.610 --> 36:32.285
Captain, there will be a short delay.

36:32.827 --> 36:34.332
Korris has escaped.

36:34.875 --> 36:38.009
He is a trained Klingon warrior,
Captain.

36:38.176 --> 36:40.684
Perhaps more than you can handle.

36:40.851 --> 36:44.695
It is not a disgrace
to request our assistance.

36:46.993 --> 36:49.125
I think
we can handle the situation.

36:58.401 --> 36:59.697
What?!

37:01.368 --> 37:03.206
Keep down!

37:15.033 --> 37:17.038
He's up there!

37:17.999 --> 37:20.255
Captain, Korris
is in Main Engineering.

37:23.431 --> 37:26.106
Capt Korris,
this is a futile attempt.

37:26.273 --> 37:28.404
You cannot win.

37:28.571 --> 37:30.786
I will speak only to my countryman!

37:30.954 --> 37:32.959
Only to Worf!

37:44.534 --> 37:48.002
Captain, he has a phaser aimed
at the dilithium crystal chamber.

37:48.170 --> 37:51.052
- At that range one blast and...
- I understand, Lieutenant.

37:51.220 --> 37:54.980
Captain,...
permission to leave the bridge.

37:58.824 --> 38:00.413
We'll both go.

38:15.874 --> 38:17.169
What's the situation?

38:17.336 --> 38:20.805
He's armed with a phaser.
We do not have a clear field of fire.

38:20.973 --> 38:23.271
- How do you suggest we proceed?
- Wait him out.

38:23.437 --> 38:26.572
- Captain, let me talk to him.
- I do not think that's a good idea.

38:26.738 --> 38:30.332
He's running on adrenaline.
Let it cool. He can't go anywhere.

38:30.500 --> 38:33.758
He will wait only as long
as he believes it's to his advantage.

38:33.926 --> 38:38.857
The moment it is not, he will fire
into the dilithium crystal chamber.

38:39.024 --> 38:41.448
That would destroy
the Enterprise and him.

38:41.615 --> 38:44.205
Yes. He knows.

38:44.999 --> 38:47.005
Talk to him, Worf.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.458
Brother!

39:01.088 --> 39:03.469
I knew you would come.

39:09.027 --> 39:10.155
Now l...

39:10.322 --> 39:12.328
We have a chance!

39:15.044 --> 39:17.384
I could not do it alone.

39:17.552 --> 39:18.972
But I would rather die here

39:19.139 --> 39:23.317
than let the traitors of Kling
pick the meat from my bones!

39:24.613 --> 39:26.911
With you... it will work.

39:27.079 --> 39:29.043
What will work?

39:29.210 --> 39:32.971
We will demand Capt Picard
give us access to the battle bridge.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.394
We will separate
from the rest of the ship,

39:35.562 --> 39:38.403
then together
we will light up the galaxy!

39:39.072 --> 39:41.829
Imagine the fear
that will roll before us!

39:41.996 --> 39:45.465
Capt Picard will not comply.

39:45.632 --> 39:49.101
He cannot... dare not refuse us!

39:49.267 --> 39:52.318
To save themselves
they will give us what we demand.

39:52.485 --> 39:55.326
Then, brother, we are free!

39:57.583 --> 39:59.338
Put down the phaser.

40:01.219 --> 40:02.179
Wait.

40:03.767 --> 40:06.776
- I do not believe this.
- Believe it!

40:07.612 --> 40:10.328
I have tasted your heart!

40:10.495 --> 40:14.131
You have been with them,
but you are still of us!

40:15.175 --> 40:17.515
Do not deny the challenge
of your destiny.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.938
Get off your knees and soar!

40:20.106 --> 40:23.575
Open your eyes
and let the dream take flight!

40:24.284 --> 40:28.255
My brother,
it is you who does not see.

40:28.422 --> 40:31.222
You look for battles
in the wrong place.

40:31.388 --> 40:36.110
The true test of a warrior
is not without, it is within.

40:36.277 --> 40:39.119
Here!
Here is where we meet the challenge!

40:40.331 --> 40:44.050
It is the weaknesses in here
a warrior must overcome.

40:44.218 --> 40:46.056
No.

40:46.223 --> 40:50.569
You have talked of glory
and of conquest,

40:50.736 --> 40:52.741
and legends we will write.

40:53.369 --> 40:56.168
Yes.
The birthright of every Klingon.

40:56.335 --> 41:02.437
Yet in all you say, where are the
words "duty", "honour", "loyalty"?

41:02.604 --> 41:04.986
Without which a warrior is nothing!

41:06.531 --> 41:08.370
What are you saying?

41:09.415 --> 41:13.929
Living among these humans has
sucked the Klingon heart out of you.

41:14.095 --> 41:16.268
Put down the phaser.

41:16.435 --> 41:18.106
You are a sham!

41:18.692 --> 41:21.574
My words were dust upon the ground!

41:21.742 --> 41:26.589
Your blood has no fire!
You are weak, like them!

41:26.756 --> 41:31.646
I don't care what you look like,
you are no Klingon!

41:31.813 --> 41:33.191
Perhaps not.

41:40.504 --> 41:41.674
Wait!

42:35.078 --> 42:38.796
- La Forge, open hailing frequencies.
- Hailing frequencies open.

42:38.964 --> 42:42.850
- K'nera, this is Capt Picard.
- Yes, Captain?

42:43.017 --> 42:46.527
Korris and the other Klingon
are dead.

42:47.906 --> 42:51.083
May I speak with Lt. Worf?

42:56.973 --> 42:58.396
Yes, Commander?

42:59.272 --> 43:01.194
How did they die?

43:02.991 --> 43:05.039
They died well.

43:05.206 --> 43:06.962
Do you wish the bodies returned?

43:07.964 --> 43:13.396
They are now only empty shells.
Dispose of them as you see fit.

43:15.736 --> 43:18.871
When your tour of duty
on the Enterprise is complete,

43:19.038 --> 43:20.667
consider serving with us.

43:20.835 --> 43:24.093
Your training and experience
would benefit us.

43:24.261 --> 43:28.648
And perhaps there are some things
we could teach you.

43:29.861 --> 43:32.619
I am honoured. Thank you.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.467
I was just being polite, sir.

43:53.469 --> 43:56.938
Commendable, Lieutenant.

44:01.786 --> 44:04.251
Mr. La Forge,
set course for Star base 84.

44:04.419 --> 44:05.797
Aye, sir.

44:06.967 --> 44:11.021
Really,... I have no desire
to leave the Enterprise.

44:11.187 --> 44:12.441
Good.

44:12.609 --> 44:15.283
Coordinates set in, Captain.

44:15.450 --> 44:18.834
- Speed,... warp five.
- Aye, sir, warp five.

44:22.721 --> 44:24.644
And, Mr. Worf,...

44:25.897 --> 44:28.445
..the bridge
wouldn't be the same without you.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.379
Engage.

44:35.305 --> 44:41.646
