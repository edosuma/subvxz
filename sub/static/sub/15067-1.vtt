WEBVTT

01:28.755 --> 01:29.755
- Ah.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.494
- Airport
South, apologizes for any

01:35.496 --> 01:38.230
delays or lineups
for passengers.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.833
Please check your valuables
into departure ports

01:40.835 --> 01:42.935
for any reported delays.

01:42.937 --> 01:47.673
After arriving, departures
updated in 10 minutes.

01:47.675 --> 01:50.008
- My name is Blutarsky,
Detective Blutarsky,

01:50.010 --> 01:51.543
from, uh, from.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.481
Detective Blutarsky,

01:55.483 --> 01:57.749
that's from Downtown Division.

01:57.751 --> 01:58.750
- Downtown, downtown.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.853
Come on, Mitch.

02:00.855 --> 02:03.689
My name's Blutarsky,
Detective Blutarsky,

02:03.691 --> 02:05.324
from Downtown Division.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.926
Listen, fellow, don't
try anything stupid.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.329
A guy like you, strapped
down with 50 pounds

02:10.330 --> 02:12.731
of ex, explosives, uh, ah.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.937
- Please don't
do anything stupid, fellow.

02:18.939 --> 02:22.674
A man like you strapped down
with 50 pounds of dynamite.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.609
- Ah.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.877
Dynamite, dynamite of course.

02:24.879 --> 02:28.814
Come on, Mitch, get your
thespian act together.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.984
How, oh, how do you
do, my good madam?

02:31.986 --> 02:33.719
An actor never misses
his or her opportunity

02:33.721 --> 02:36.922
to hone their craft,
don't you know?

02:44.464 --> 02:45.864
- Hey, mister.

02:46.966 --> 02:49.401
Give a little something
to help a brother out?

02:52.139 --> 02:53.672
Just a sec.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.874
I have to take this.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.109
Hello?

02:58.578 --> 03:00.812
Yep, yeah, I'm glad you called.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.315
Hey, look, when I order a dog,

03:03.317 --> 03:05.484
just send me something
without a paw,

03:05.486 --> 03:08.220
or missing a limb, or
something, anything.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.489
I need to bring up
the sympathy factor.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.659
Yeah, well my
revenue's down 20%.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.994
No, three o'clock is
out of the question.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.096
I've got an appointment
with my broker.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.865
Hang on a second.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.602
Hey, hey, mister, see
you on the way out?

03:47.293 --> 03:48.961
- Listen.

03:48.963 --> 03:50.929
Are you a cop?

03:50.931 --> 03:53.532
- Uh, no, but I hope
to play one soon on TV.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.933
I have a big audition
tomorrow morning.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.402
- You, by rights, you
must identify yourself

03:57.404 --> 04:00.772
as a law enforcement
officer if I ask.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.375
- I'm not following.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.944
- I offer two price packages,

04:05.946 --> 04:08.880
based on my buggy's
two speed options.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.783
- Uh, pardon me, madam?

04:11.785 --> 04:15.554
- Yes, you can have
oral at a slower pace.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.459
- Uh.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.994
- Or you can have
it at a faster rate.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.965
But I'll have to
charge you extra.

04:26.967 --> 04:30.836
Because of the wear and
tear on my batteries.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.272
So.

04:33.274 --> 04:36.408
Are we going to make
this happen, or what?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.976
I mean, I've got a
couple of customers

04:37.978 --> 04:40.412
over in Domestic Departures,

04:40.414 --> 04:42.447
they won't be wasting
time kicking tires

04:42.449 --> 04:44.249
like you are.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.817
- So let me get this straight.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.986
You just scoot around
the airport all day long,

04:47.988 --> 04:50.856
evading airport security,
while offering passersby

04:50.858 --> 04:53.959
random acts of
mechanized fellatio?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.494
- I knew it!

04:55.496 --> 04:58.497
Your aftershave
smells like bacon.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.033
Nice try, officer.

05:03.770 --> 05:04.770
Ha!

05:05.339 --> 05:06.738
Vaya con dios!

05:32.332 --> 05:35.834
- That's quite the
sign you have there.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.842
Listen, I don't want
to be overly intrusive,

05:43.844 --> 05:46.345
but, uh, are you sure
someone's not playing

05:46.347 --> 05:47.746
some kind of practical
joke on you, I mean,

05:47.748 --> 05:50.182
you are holding
a sign that says.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.416
- It's the name of a film.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.118
If you must know.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.058
- Attention
passengers, final
call for boarding.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.994
- It's not one of those
teenage vampire movies, is it?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.396
I mean, I don't
understand what's so scary

06:04.398 --> 06:06.365
about teenage vampires.

06:06.367 --> 06:10.569
Back in my day, we had
Dracula, uh, we had Nosferatu,

06:10.571 --> 06:13.839
and let's not forget
good old Blacula.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.707
I mean, those guys were scary.

06:15.709 --> 06:19.344
Spending a lifetime, suffering
the pangs of the undead.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.446
I mean, those guys
had character.

06:21.448 --> 06:24.116
I mean, these adolescent
vampires today,

06:24.118 --> 06:27.119
I mean, it's like, "Uh,
uh dude, I'd really like

06:27.121 --> 06:29.788
"to suck your blood, but
it's like, uh, I got to

06:29.790 --> 06:32.391
"download a new app for
my phone, so, maybe I'll

06:32.393 --> 06:35.093
"suck your blood later."

06:35.095 --> 06:38.363
You have a serious credibility
problem as a vampire

06:38.365 --> 06:41.600
if you've only just started
sprouting pubic hair.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.201
- It's an erotic motion picture.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.970
I was hired to pick up
the cast and take them

06:44.972 --> 06:46.938
to the Adult Film Convention.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.940
So, if you don't mind.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.042
- That reminds me.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.878
Have you ever seen
the movie Magic Mike?

06:52.880 --> 06:55.747
I mean, hear you have
this supposedly sizzling

06:55.749 --> 06:59.117
expose' of the world
of male strippers,

06:59.119 --> 07:00.719
and yet, there's isn't
even like an ounce of full

07:00.721 --> 07:03.121
frontal male nudity
in the whole movie.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.723
I mean, how does that happen?

07:04.725 --> 07:07.225
That is like a totally typical
Hollywood double standard

07:07.227 --> 07:08.760
when it comes to nudity.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.362
It's ridiculous.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.798
You know, I'm actually
waiting for an

07:12.800 --> 07:14.833
old high school friend.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.335
Yeah, we haven't seen
each other in 30 years.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.804
Can you believe that?

07:18.806 --> 07:21.506
Oh, oh, how time does fly.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.108
Just seems like yesterday
I was like cramming

07:23.110 --> 07:26.111
for like a big biology
exam, or worried about a new

07:26.113 --> 07:28.580
outbreak of pimples.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.749
Can you believe that?

07:30.751 --> 07:32.284
Ah.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.286
Wow.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.623
- Oh, my God, you guys,
we got a chauffeur!

07:38.625 --> 07:39.625
- Oh, wow!

07:40.259 --> 07:41.026
- Yeah.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.528
- We need a picture.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.030
- Let's ask this old man.

07:45.032 --> 07:48.166
- Oh, um, Sir,
would you be a doll?

07:55.174 --> 07:56.942
- Hey, are you ladies ready?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.612
- Okay, smile and
say venereal disease.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.024
- Yeah.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.407
Attention passengers.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.025
- Hey!

08:47.027 --> 08:47.826
- Wow!

08:47.828 --> 08:48.927
- Same old Mitch.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.196
Standing around daydreaming.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.331
- Hey, I was being
totally vigilant searching

08:53.333 --> 08:55.200
for you, I swear to God.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.501
- Vigilant.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.736
That's another thing I
always loved about you,

08:57.738 --> 08:59.671
using big words like that.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.673
Come here!

09:01.407 --> 09:02.407
- What?

09:15.021 --> 09:17.355
- Pretty spiffy jacket
you got there, Mitch.

09:17.357 --> 09:21.092
- Oh, this is my, uh, 1970's
disillusioned cop look.

09:21.094 --> 09:25.096
I got a big audition tomorrow
morning at nine a.m. sharp.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.265
- Yeah, right, I remember
you mentioning you were

09:27.267 --> 09:29.367
dabbling in that stuff.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.569
- Well, this is all
part of my whole

09:30.571 --> 09:33.238
sensory experience, Dunc.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.774
It's like uh, this is
all really important when

09:35.776 --> 09:38.076
you're in the world
of the thespian.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.244
- You thespians?

09:39.246 --> 09:40.812
What?

09:40.814 --> 09:42.547
- Come on, Dunc.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.150
Thespians, everybody
knows that means actor.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.618
Come on.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.286
- Whatever.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.756
Look, I'm really glad to be
here after all these years.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.292
- No, no, no, hey, I got this.

09:55.662 --> 09:56.628
- Maybe I should
grab that, Mitch.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.929
- No, no, it's okay.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.764
Isn't there supposed
to be some kind of uh,

09:59.766 --> 10:01.499
weight limitations
on these things?

10:01.501 --> 10:05.270
It feels like you've
got a minivan in here.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.738
- Hey, Mitch, did you
see a bunch of smoking

10:06.740 --> 10:09.341
hot girls come through here?

10:09.343 --> 10:12.243
Man, they were sitting
up front in first class.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.211
Shit.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.348
All that amazing pussy
onboard and I have to get

10:16.350 --> 10:18.984
stuck back with some old fart.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.152
Snoring on my shoulder.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.555
- My car's this way, Dunc.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.359
- Sure my bag's
not too heavy for you,

10:27.361 --> 10:28.293
hey, Mitch?

10:28.295 --> 10:29.828
- Oh, no problem, Dunc.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.196
Maybe when I'm done
lugging this thing around,

10:31.198 --> 10:33.798
I'll be able to audition
for the role of Quasimodo.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.767
- Jesus, Mitch,
where the fuck did you park,

10:35.769 --> 10:37.168
on the runway?

10:38.304 --> 10:39.704
- Hey, Dunc, it's
not like it's in the movies

10:39.706 --> 10:41.506
where the protagonist
always gets to scooch

10:41.508 --> 10:44.909
into the best parking
spots, you know.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.846
You know, Dunc, these suitcases?

10:47.848 --> 10:51.049
They actually come
with wheels now.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.417
I'm just saying.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.291
- Please, tell me
that's your fucking car, Mitch.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.960
- There she is.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.562
Like a beacon shining
in the wilderness, Dunc.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.531
- Well, saints
be fucking praised.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.033
Any longer I was going
to have to resort

11:08.035 --> 11:09.567
to cannibalism.

11:23.549 --> 11:24.549
- Ah.

11:26.986 --> 11:28.353
I think I suffered
temporary paralysis

11:28.355 --> 11:31.489
in three of my favorite
vertebrae, Dunc.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.590
- Is there something
you're not telling me

11:32.592 --> 11:33.892
about yourself, Mitch?

11:33.894 --> 11:36.428
- Oh, yeah, well,
uh, when I ordered my

11:36.430 --> 11:39.064
customized license
plate, I mean, I told

11:39.066 --> 11:42.200
them I wanted it
to read, thespian.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.269
But, I don't know, there
was some kind of mix up,

11:44.271 --> 11:48.907
- Here we are, after
all those years.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.075
- Yes, Sir.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.943
They said it
couldn't happen, but,

11:51.945 --> 11:55.447
the dynamic duo's back
together once again, Dunc.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.539
Well, let's make like a
couple of French mimes,

12:21.541 --> 12:24.709
and wave au revoir
to this place, Dunc.

12:24.711 --> 12:25.610
What?

12:25.612 --> 12:27.479
- What do I need to do?

12:27.481 --> 12:28.747
- What?

12:29.448 --> 12:32.650
It's a car door,
just open it, Dunc.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.053
Oh, hey.

12:36.889 --> 12:38.089
What's this?

12:39.391 --> 12:40.658
I know it's not
a parking ticket,

12:40.660 --> 12:41.926
- What is that?
- Maybe it's a new,

12:41.928 --> 12:44.062
maybe it's a pizza
joint opening, or some

12:44.064 --> 12:46.097
religious tract, let's see.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.966
"The revolution is a lie."

12:47.968 --> 12:49.667
That's rather cryptic.

12:49.669 --> 12:50.769
Ah.

12:50.771 --> 12:51.803
- Wait, wait, wait.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.138
Give it here.

13:13.425 --> 13:16.528
- Hm, that's never
happened before.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.163
- You don't say.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.670
- What?

13:25.672 --> 13:27.438
- I'm just curious
how you start the car.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.873
What do you knock on
the dashboard twice

13:28.875 --> 13:31.276
with your forehead, or what?

13:31.278 --> 13:32.544
- Hmph, what?

13:33.712 --> 13:36.314
With the keys, of course.

13:36.316 --> 13:40.718
Hmph, knock on the dashboard
twice with my forehead.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.455
That's how you start
the air conditioner.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.468
Let's make like a
couple of pot smokers,

13:57.470 --> 13:59.170
and head out.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.239
- Do you just make
those expressions up, or?

14:01.241 --> 14:03.474
- Those are
100% my own creativity.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.878
- I've got an
inexhaustible supply of them.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.213
How about let's
make like a couple

14:08.215 --> 14:09.647
of hosers and take off?

14:09.649 --> 14:11.482
- Amazing.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.318
- Or, if you prefer
something a little darker,

14:13.320 --> 14:15.386
let's make like a
couple of IV drug users

14:15.388 --> 14:16.754
and make tracks.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.058
Feel free to drop
those into conversation

14:20.060 --> 14:21.492
whenever you want.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.994
Just be sure to give me credit.

14:22.996 --> 14:26.698
- I'll remember
to do that, Mitch.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.519
- Welp, here we are, Dunc.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.555
And they said it
couldn't happen.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.090
- Yeah, who said that?

14:52.092 --> 14:53.591
- Uh, nobody, actually.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.094
It's just an expression.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.295
- Oh, right.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.866
So we haven't seen each other
since high school, right?

15:01.868 --> 15:03.735
And now we're both 50.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.570
Hard to fucking believe.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.406
- Uh, I hate to
quibble, Dunc, but, uh,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.408
I'm actually only 49.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.645
Technically, I don't turn
50 for another 11 days.

15:13.647 --> 15:16.614
- Well, anyway you slice
it, this calls for a drink.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.249
- Hey, don't worry.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.251
I'm going to take us to our
favorite old coffee shop.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.753
- Oh, fuck that, Mitch.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.389
I'm talking about a real drink.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.659
- How'd you get that
through airport security?

15:27.661 --> 15:30.995
- I'd tell you, but I'd
have to kill you, Mitch.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.464
- Uh, no thanks, Dunc,
I generally like to keep

15:33.466 --> 15:36.167
my mental faculties
intact when I'm operating

15:36.169 --> 15:39.170
four thousand
pounds of machinery.

15:40.139 --> 15:43.141
- So, um, this
acting thing, Mitch.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.678
Is that some sort
of hobby, or what?

15:46.680 --> 15:49.681
- Ha, it's considerably
more than that, Dunc.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.916
I think this time I
actually found my passion.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.818
My muse, if you will.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.120
Yes, sir, no more
wandering the barren plains

15:56.122 --> 15:59.657
of unrealized dreams
for yours truly.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.659
- So, what have you been in?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.361
- What, you mean like which
characters I've played,

16:03.363 --> 16:04.829
and roles, et cetera?

16:04.831 --> 16:08.700
- No, I mean, what have I
seen you in specifically.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.635
- Uh, well, lately I've
been hitting a lot of, uh,

16:10.637 --> 16:13.538
a lot of auditions, uh, you
know, like the one I have

16:13.540 --> 16:17.842
This is typically the lifeblood
of the working actor, Dunc.

16:17.844 --> 16:21.512
- So in other words, you
haven't done anything.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.615
- Well, for your information,
uh, I actually had

16:24.617 --> 16:26.784
a callback from the last one.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.786
A callback is actually when.
- Let me guess.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.855
When you get called back?

16:31.890 --> 16:33.558
- Yeah, well, anyways,
it was for a luncheon

16:33.560 --> 16:35.226
food commercial.

16:35.228 --> 16:38.696
Nationally televised, pays
big residuals, by the way.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.065
I played, you know, a boring
high school principal,

16:41.067 --> 16:43.901
who, upon ingesting the
transformative contents

16:43.903 --> 16:46.838
of said luncheon meat,
turns into a libidinous,

16:46.840 --> 16:49.040
fun living rapper.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.708
- You as a rapper?

16:50.710 --> 16:52.343
Jeez, I'd love to
hear that, Mitch,

16:52.345 --> 16:54.912
but, uh, I need a drink first.

16:57.816 --> 16:58.816
Ah.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.854
Okay, Mitch, I think I'm ready.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.888
- Hang on, just got
to go through a little

17:04.891 --> 17:06.656
actor prep.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.827
That's what we like to
call that, in the biz.

17:09.829 --> 17:10.661
Mrap

17:10.663 --> 17:11.896
Mwah.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.664
Mwah.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.866
Mwah.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.867
Mm, yep.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.435
Here we go.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.906
♪ They call me Principal T,
you know that I be illin'

17:21.907 --> 17:23.273
♪ Just a chillin'
with my homies,

17:23.276 --> 17:26.176
♪ Eatin' pastrami
and mock chicken ♪

17:26.179 --> 17:28.946
- And why didn't you
get that role, Mitch?

17:28.948 --> 17:31.883
- Uh, well, to tell
you the truth, uh,

17:31.885 --> 17:33.684
I do my best to stay
confident at these

17:33.686 --> 17:34.919
auditions, but I don't know.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.788
It's like when I get
in there, and I see

17:36.790 --> 17:38.856
all those anxious actors,

17:38.858 --> 17:42.393
it's like the desperation's
palpable, Dunc.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.795
What, palpable?

17:43.797 --> 17:45.229
Come on, Dunc.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.697
I don't know, anyways,
it's like we're all

17:46.699 --> 17:47.932
sitting around on
death row, like waiting

17:47.934 --> 17:50.802
for the executioner
to come and get us.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.203
Ah, I don't know.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.539
And then by the time I get
into the audition room,

17:54.541 --> 17:57.108
it's like, I just choke.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.810
- You got to loosen up.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.144
You know what your
problem is, you're just

18:00.146 --> 18:02.880
too fucking tightly wound.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.383
- I don't know man, I mean,
I've tried everything.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.753
Uh, breathing exercises,
cell visualization,

18:08.755 --> 18:10.721
I've even listened to
tapes of deep sea mammals,

18:10.723 --> 18:11.823
copulating.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.659
- Jesus.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.993
Now you really need a drink.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.628
- Nah, I'm good.

18:19.798 --> 18:23.468
- Don't let the darkness
eat you up, Mitch.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.105
- Look, Dunc.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.739
That's where our favorite
old cinema used to be.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.675
No doubt to be replaced
by one of those soulless,

18:30.677 --> 18:33.277
cookie cutter multiplexes
with 40 screens, and all

18:33.279 --> 18:34.946
showing the same film.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.948
- Hey, I love
those new theaters, Mitch.

18:36.950 --> 18:41.419
Big ass seats, massive sound,
the whole VIP experience.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.687
Soon they'll have pretty
usherettes delivering

18:42.689 --> 18:45.756
hand jobs during the trailers.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.024
- Still, I miss
the charm of that old

18:47.026 --> 18:48.960
broken down Movie Palace.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.661
It had character, Dunc.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.463
- Not to mention
faulty air conditioning,

18:52.465 --> 18:54.866
rats and cramped seats
designed for an average

18:54.868 --> 18:59.837
Other than that, it
was real swell, Mitch.

19:00.839 --> 19:01.639
- Here's what's left of our

19:01.641 --> 19:02.940
old high school, Dunc.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.542
Sad really.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.944
- Good riddance to
that old prison, I say.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.480
I wish I was there
to pull the plunger.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.282
- Come on, Dunc, we
learned a lot back there.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.049
- Really?

19:12.051 --> 19:13.818
Like what, Mitch?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.020
- Well, I still
remember from biology class

19:16.022 --> 19:18.890
the scientific name for DNA.

19:18.892 --> 19:21.025
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.895
- I'll bet that's
really come in handy, Mitch.

19:23.897 --> 19:27.532
- Surprisingly, it hasn't, Dunc.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.234
That used to be our
old skating rink.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.836
Remember, we used to play
hockey there really early

19:31.838 --> 19:33.838
in the mornings
when we were kids?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.106
- Right.

19:39.978 --> 19:41.546
- Look what I have, Dunc.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.214
Ring any bells?

19:43.216 --> 19:44.882
The Snotty Punks?

19:44.884 --> 19:47.385
From the album, Young,
British and Snotty?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.753
I mean, this was
practically the soundtrack

19:48.755 --> 19:50.888
of our youth, Dunc.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.924
- Yeah, The Snotty Punks.

19:52.926 --> 19:56.594
Yeah, I can sort of remember
us listening to them.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.863
Aren't those guys all dead now?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.932
- Uh, I think the lead
singer, Johnny Snotnose

20:00.934 --> 20:02.767
is still around.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.769
Actually, I think that
he just got a knighthood.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.437
- Hm.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.540
- Guess that makes him Sir
Johnny Snotnose, I guess.

20:09.542 --> 20:13.311
Well, here's to the
glory of the past, Dunc.

20:16.114 --> 20:19.550
♪ Because we're young, British

20:26.758 --> 20:27.558
- Let me guess, Mitch.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.260
That never happens.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.629
- I'm very disheartened, Dunc.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.863
I wanted us to just to
kind of drive around,

20:32.865 --> 20:35.233
and listen to our
favorite old tunes,

20:35.235 --> 20:38.069
you know, for old time's sake.

20:40.038 --> 20:43.040
Here, let me just,
uh, you know what?

20:43.042 --> 20:45.743
I'll just wind this up later.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.980
- Well, look, Mitch,
don't sweat it.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.282
The past ain't all
it's cracked up to be.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.883
- Ah, good choice
of words, Dunc.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.252
Cracked up?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.420
Look what I have.

20:58.890 --> 20:59.890
What do you think, Dunc?

20:59.892 --> 21:02.593
- Yeah, remember we
used to drive around

21:02.595 --> 21:05.396
on Friday nights and toss
these puppies at people?

21:05.398 --> 21:07.231
- We used to do that?

21:07.233 --> 21:08.933
You mean, when all our
friends were out getting laid,

21:08.935 --> 21:12.236
we were driving around
throwing eggs at people?

21:12.238 --> 21:15.640
Wow, that is beyond
depressing, Mitch.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.813
Look, Mitch, I appreciate
your attempts to recreate

21:22.815 --> 21:24.849
the old magic, but,
maybe we can have those

21:24.851 --> 21:26.284
for breakfast.

21:31.456 --> 21:35.092
- So, how are you
and Cindy doing?

21:35.094 --> 21:36.694
You guys were married
like practically right

21:36.696 --> 21:38.496
out of high school, Dunc.

21:38.498 --> 21:42.667
I mean, that was like,
almost 30 years ago.

21:42.669 --> 21:46.437
25 years is silver anniversary,
what does that make

21:46.439 --> 21:47.538
30 years, I wonder?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.640
- I'm guessing arsenic.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.810
That's what three decades
of torture should get you.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.212
You should be proud of
your accomplishment.

21:55.214 --> 21:56.981
I mean, especially in
this kind of world,

21:56.983 --> 21:59.483
that's just lacking
any kind of loyalty.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.019
Hey, I remember we voted
you guys couple most likely

22:02.021 --> 22:04.488
to stay together until death.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.657
- Oh, yeah, by the
way, thanks for that.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.859
No pressure there at all.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.061
- You and Cindy, I
mean, you guys are

22:10.063 --> 22:12.630
still together, right?

22:12.632 --> 22:14.165
Aw, Dunc.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.500
I just feel like a little
piece of my soul is missing,

22:16.502 --> 22:18.669
just knowing that
you're not together.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.272
- You'll get over it, Mitch.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.510
So, um, what about you, Mitch?

22:26.512 --> 22:29.046
I mean, any wives, girlfriends.

22:29.048 --> 22:29.980
- Huh, me?

22:29.982 --> 22:31.248
No way, Dunc.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.651
I'm keeping my eye
on the acting prize.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.019
- Yeah, you sure
wouldn't want to miss any

22:35.021 --> 22:37.988
of those luncheon meat
commercials of yours.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.925
- Well, hey, Dusty Hoffman,
one of our generation's

22:40.927 --> 22:42.560
finest actors.
- Wait, wait.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.061
Dusty?

22:44.063 --> 22:46.697
I thought his name was
Dustin, Dustin Hoffman.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.032
- Well, his friends
and associates.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.934
- Of which you're neither.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.336
- Well, apparently,
when he's on set,

22:52.338 --> 22:53.571
by on set, I mean.

22:53.573 --> 22:57.508
- Let me guess, it
means when he's on set.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.944
- Yeah, well,
apparently Dusty he lets

22:59.946 --> 23:02.446
the cast and crew
call him by that name.

23:02.448 --> 23:05.349
I mean, my, my acting coach
told me that, actually.

23:05.351 --> 23:08.786
- Well, you know, I'm sure,
Mitch, that, that Dustin,

23:08.788 --> 23:11.722
Dusty Hoffman, sorry, wasn't
scratching and struggling

23:11.724 --> 23:13.958
at the ripe old
age of 50, Mitch.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.961
- Uh, I'm actually
49, Dunc, remember?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.896
- Mm, I keep forgetting.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.466
- Yeah, I don't turn
50 for another 11 days.

23:22.468 --> 23:25.236
- So when was the last
time you got laid, Mitch?

23:25.238 --> 23:26.937
- What?

23:26.939 --> 23:28.873
- Let me rephrase the
question, your honor.

23:28.875 --> 23:32.209
When was the last time
you scored some pussy?

23:32.211 --> 23:33.944
- Well, I don't know, Dunc.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.447
Let me go home and check
my fornication journal.

23:36.449 --> 23:39.350
- That's what I thought, Mitch.

23:44.222 --> 23:47.925
Look, how about we
go cruising around,

23:47.927 --> 23:49.760
and try and meet some ladies?

23:49.762 --> 23:51.228
- What, and toss eggs at them?

23:51.230 --> 23:54.098
- No, Mitch, that's
not what I had in mind.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.066
Um, I'm just thinking,
the night is young,

23:56.068 --> 23:59.103
maybe we could, uh,
find a party and uh,

23:59.105 --> 24:01.806
celebrate our wonderful reunion.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.174
- Uh, I don't know, Dunc.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.408
I was going to take you
to that old coffee shop

24:04.410 --> 24:06.944
of ours, and maybe wind
it down for the evening.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.279
Because you remember,
I got that big audition

24:08.281 --> 24:10.448
at nine a.m. tomorrow.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.183
- Relax, Mitch, you're
not going to miss your

24:12.185 --> 24:14.285
all important dog food audition.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.153
- Dog food audition?

24:16.155 --> 24:17.488
I told you, I'm
auditioning for the role

24:17.490 --> 24:19.190
of a cop, remember?

24:19.192 --> 24:20.591
- Fine.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.494
How about we go
bird-dog some chicks?

24:23.496 --> 24:25.496
- Bird dog some ladies?

24:25.498 --> 24:27.898
What are you, Buddy Holly?

24:29.835 --> 24:31.368
There are very subtle, but
very distinct differences

24:31.370 --> 24:35.806
in the Meisner versus Strasberg
Schools of Method Acting.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.212
So, I was wondering,

24:41.214 --> 24:43.113
do you shampoo,
lather and rinse?

24:43.115 --> 24:47.384
Or, do you shampoo, lather,
and rinse and repeat?

24:55.494 --> 24:58.162
So, is it actually
karaoke, or karookie?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.072
So, how come the
breakfast food industry

25:08.074 --> 25:10.140
isn't able to say, "So,
when you're shopping

25:10.142 --> 25:11.909
"for a breakfast cereal,
three month's salary's

25:11.911 --> 25:14.211
"a good place to start."?

25:16.181 --> 25:18.916
So, I've heard of
a gaggle of geese,

25:18.918 --> 25:21.218
that's one expression
that's a little weird.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.320
But, a murder of crows?

25:23.322 --> 25:27.458
Now, whoever invented that,
they're just messing with us.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.261
- It's all coming
back to me, Mitch.

25:30.263 --> 25:32.096
Your winning touch
with the ladies.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.330
- Come on, Dunc.

25:33.332 --> 25:34.698
We're having a great
time just getting

25:34.700 --> 25:36.901
reacquainted, aren't we?

25:40.405 --> 25:43.407
Look, here's one of our
favorite old haunts.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.109
Remember this place, Dunc?

25:45.111 --> 25:46.577
Let's go get some
of that world famous

25:46.579 --> 25:50.214
cinnamon coffee we
used to love so much.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.752
Hm, I was wrong, Dunc.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.086
- About what?

25:56.088 --> 25:57.755
- It is possible to get
a great parking spot

25:57.757 --> 26:00.257
in real life, as well
as in the movies.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.092
This is a great omen.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.094
Come on.

26:05.263 --> 26:06.664
Oh, hey, wait.

26:07.365 --> 26:08.265
- What is it, Mitch?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.767
Why aren't we going inside?

26:09.769 --> 26:10.968
- You know what?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.269
Let's do our old
personalized greeting

26:12.271 --> 26:14.605
that we did back in high school.

26:14.607 --> 26:15.539
- What?

26:15.541 --> 26:16.707
- Remember, we went like that,

26:16.709 --> 26:17.709
come on.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.380
What, oh, what's that?

26:23.382 --> 26:24.782
That's not what we did.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.083
You've got to
really get into it,

26:26.085 --> 26:28.752
you have to really dig in.
- Uh, no, no, no, no.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.588
No way, Mitch, I am
not doing that, okay?

26:30.590 --> 26:32.323
That is like so 30 years ago.

26:32.325 --> 26:33.624
Forget it.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.092
- Let's just do it
for old time's sake?

26:35.094 --> 26:35.993
- Not a chance, Mitch.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.329
Come on, let's go inside.

26:45.236 --> 26:46.604
- So, how's it feel
to be back in the old

26:46.606 --> 26:48.138
place again, Dunc?

26:48.140 --> 26:49.239
- I don't know.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.841
It feels like I'm
in a coffee shop.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.744
- Ah, we stanched many emotional
wounds on our inexorable

26:53.746 --> 26:55.279
march into manhood, Dunc.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.681
Right here, possibly
at this very table.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.149
- Whatever.

26:59.151 --> 27:02.353
Mind you, the place does
seem a little changed,

27:02.355 --> 27:04.254
I mean the decor and whatnot.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.956
- Alright, what
can I get you guys?

27:05.958 --> 27:08.258
- Oh, how do you
do, my good lady?

27:08.260 --> 27:09.560
Uh, uh, uh.

27:13.298 --> 27:17.668
Um, um, tonight you have the
great honor of serving us

27:17.670 --> 27:18.969
on the occasion of this.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.271
Our first time meeting
in nearly 30 years.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.273
We'd both like to partake
in a couple of your

27:23.275 --> 27:27.478
world famous cinnamon
coffees, my good madam.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.346
- What are you talking about?

27:29.348 --> 27:31.281
- Well, cinnamon
coffee, of course.

27:31.283 --> 27:34.151
It's your house specialty.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.120
- Why would anyone put
cinnamon in their coffee,

27:36.122 --> 27:38.689
I mean, who does that anymore?

27:41.459 --> 27:43.627
- Well, I'll take
two cinnamon coffees,

27:43.629 --> 27:47.831
and you can put the
cinnamon between your knees.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.502
You see, my friend and
I here who again, may I,

27:51.504 --> 27:53.337
I reiterate, have not
seen each other in nearly

27:53.339 --> 27:56.974
30 years, well, we used
to frequent your cozy

27:56.976 --> 27:59.209
little establishment, back
in our tender, formative

27:59.211 --> 28:01.578
years, and we used to
find sweet succor in the

28:01.580 --> 28:05.482
restorative grinds of your
blessed cinnamon coffee.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.885
- Again, there
is no cinnamon coffee.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.687
Are you guys going, or staying?

28:09.689 --> 28:11.021
- We'll have two coffees.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.823
However you serve them
normally will be fine.

28:12.825 --> 28:13.825
Thanks.

28:16.761 --> 28:19.730
What's with finding
succor, or whatever?

28:19.732 --> 28:21.565
Nobody understands that.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.434
And will you please
stop telling people

28:23.436 --> 28:25.869
we haven't seen each
other in 30 years.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.338
They're going to think we
just got out of prison.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.340
Jesus.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.277
This place really
has changed, Dunc.

28:33.279 --> 28:37.081
I mean, I don't remember
serving personnel like that.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.515
I mean, did you see all
those tattoos crammed

28:38.517 --> 28:40.084
all over her countenance?

28:40.086 --> 28:43.420
- If you mean her face,
Mitch, yeah, I noticed.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.456
Get with the times, will
you, for Christ's sakes!

28:45.458 --> 28:48.058
All young people are
doing it nowadays.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.960
- Oh, tattoos, hey,
don't get me wrong,

28:49.962 --> 28:51.528
I totally understand that.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.697
I mean, one on the shoulder
here saying, "Rosie",

28:53.699 --> 28:56.200
maybe a little heart over
here saying, "I love mom."

28:56.202 --> 28:57.868
Hey, totally understand that.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.303
But she looked like some
kind of headhunter's

28:59.305 --> 29:01.438
straight out of the
jungles of Borneo, Dunc.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.040
I'm surprised she
didn't just chuck us

29:03.042 --> 29:04.408
in a cauldron of
boiling water and try

29:04.410 --> 29:06.076
to make soup out of us.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.312
- I have to tell you,
Mitch, I identify a lot

29:08.314 --> 29:10.447
more with these young people.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.715
- Come on, Dunc.

29:11.717 --> 29:13.984
- No, I'm serious.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.385
You know what it's
like hanging around

29:15.387 --> 29:16.720
with people our age?

29:16.722 --> 29:20.724
Constant grousing and
sniping about illnesses?

29:20.726 --> 29:22.626
I mean, that one's got
some kind of tumor,

29:22.628 --> 29:25.596
and this one's
bowels are clogged?

29:25.598 --> 29:27.798
I flat out refuse to spend
the rest of my precious

29:27.800 --> 29:32.002
years worried about the
state of my prostate, Mitch.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.905
- Come on, Dunc, I mean, you
can't change who you are.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.574
You think by like
associating with the young,

29:37.576 --> 29:39.443
you're going to somehow
like absorb all their fresh

29:39.445 --> 29:41.912
vibes and hipness, like
through some kind of osmosis,

29:41.914 --> 29:43.313
or something?

29:43.315 --> 29:44.782
- I don't know what
all that means, Mitch.

29:44.784 --> 29:49.319
What I do know is I feel
really alive with young women.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.089
My last girlfriend was 19.

29:52.091 --> 29:55.359
- Come off it with the
shock and outrage bullshit,

29:55.361 --> 29:56.693
will you?

29:56.695 --> 29:58.095
If you had to pick up a dog
from the animal shelter,

29:58.097 --> 30:00.364
would you pick up
a shiny new puppy,

30:00.366 --> 30:03.500
or some mangy old mutt
that can barely still wag

30:03.502 --> 30:05.202
its' tail?

30:05.204 --> 30:08.438
- Hey, those old dogs have
tons of character, Dunc.

30:08.440 --> 30:12.209
- Not to mention yellow
teeth, bad breath, fleas.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.777
- Here's your two
regular coffees,

30:13.779 --> 30:17.614
completely devoid of
any cinnamon whatsoever.

30:17.616 --> 30:19.283
- Oh, oh, and, madam?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.485
Just to inform you,
neither my friend here or I

30:21.487 --> 30:23.387
have ever served time
whatsoever in any correctional

30:23.389 --> 30:25.355
facility or institution.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.224
Just to let you know.

30:35.868 --> 30:36.934
I feel bad.

30:37.902 --> 30:40.070
- About what, Mitch?

30:40.072 --> 30:42.573
- I mean, why would they
discontinue their policy

30:42.575 --> 30:46.243
of serving cinnamon coffee,
when obviously, it's like.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.579
- Forget your goddamned
cinnamon coffee for a minute,

30:48.581 --> 30:50.214
would you?

30:50.216 --> 30:51.582
God, it's all starting
to come back to me, your,

30:51.584 --> 30:55.719
your whining and griping,
nonstop, as I recall.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.591
- I mean, the cinnamon
coffee's what made this

31:00.593 --> 31:04.328
I mean, who would tamper with
that formula for success?

31:04.330 --> 31:06.496
I mean, okay, like for
instance, let's say,

31:06.498 --> 31:10.334
I'm a CEO of like, Hersheys,
and I was addressing

31:10.336 --> 31:12.903
a boardroom of my top
shareholders, and I said,

31:12.905 --> 31:14.504
"Hey, thanks for coming.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.506
"We made a half a billion
dollars in our Hershey

31:16.508 --> 31:17.507
"Almond Bars last year.

31:17.509 --> 31:18.675
"Oh, but here's an idea.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.444
"From now on, let's
remove all the almonds,

31:20.446 --> 31:21.578
"from our chocolate."

31:21.580 --> 31:23.680
That's just not done, Dunc.

31:23.682 --> 31:25.616
- Listen, forget about
your beloved cinnamon

31:25.618 --> 31:27.417
for a moment, will you?

31:27.419 --> 31:29.386
Try some of this.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.623
Huh, what, are you
Toulouse-Lautrec?

31:32.625 --> 31:33.924
- Who?

31:33.926 --> 31:35.259
Is this one of your
obscure references, Mitch?

31:35.261 --> 31:37.094
- Uh, Toulouse-Lautrec,

31:37.096 --> 31:38.695
famous Parisian artist?

31:38.697 --> 31:40.931
Uh, rather diminutive
in stature,

31:40.933 --> 31:43.533
specialized in painting
the underbelly of Paris.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.602
Hung out at the Moulin Rouge.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.237
- I'm sorry I asked, Mitch.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.573
Here, this is going to
put some much needed

31:49.575 --> 31:50.774
hair on your balls.

31:50.776 --> 31:51.776
- Oh.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.645
Great.

31:54.647 --> 31:55.647
Great.

31:59.984 --> 32:01.218
- A toast.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.220
- Oh.

32:04.489 --> 32:07.758
- Here's to the
death of cinnamon.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.630
- Dunc, I don't know
whether to drink that,

32:13.632 --> 32:16.199
or power my lawnmower with it.

32:17.235 --> 32:18.635
- I got here just in
time to make a man

32:18.637 --> 32:20.637
out of you yet, Mitch.

32:20.639 --> 32:24.441
- Wait, so, anyways, what
happened with you and Cindy?

32:24.443 --> 32:26.910
I mean, you guys had
like a love for the ages,

32:26.912 --> 32:30.113
I mean, like Romeo and Juliet,
Napoleon and Josephine,

32:30.115 --> 32:34.084
uh, Liz and Dick, well,
maybe not that last couple,

32:34.086 --> 32:36.520
because they did get divorced
a tad too many times,

32:36.522 --> 32:37.788
I'll grant you that.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.756
- You know, if you had
the balls to even be

32:39.758 --> 32:43.527
in a relationship, you
wouldn't have to ask that.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.262
- Yeah, but I mean, I
just slept so much better

32:45.264 --> 32:46.964
in my bed at night knowing
that good old Duncan

32:46.966 --> 32:49.299
and Cindy were just out
in the universe together,

32:49.301 --> 32:51.134
steadfast as a rock.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.770
- A rock sinking to the
bottom of the ocean, you mean.

32:53.772 --> 32:56.840
- How bad could it
have been, Dunc?

32:59.310 --> 33:00.610
- Okay, Mitch.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.613
You want to know what
finally ended our marriage?

33:03.615 --> 33:06.016
It wasn't some melodramatic
event like an affair,

33:06.018 --> 33:08.018
or some cliche' betrayal.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.453
You know what it was?

33:09.455 --> 33:12.155
It was a fucking
kitchen blender.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.690
- A what?

33:13.692 --> 33:15.225
- Yeah.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.493
I'm serious.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.328
A fucking kitchen blender.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.530
Every morning at five
a.m., Cindy would wake up

33:20.532 --> 33:22.833
and make some healthy
something or other,

33:22.835 --> 33:25.569
in the world's noisiest blender.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.804
This thing had a fucking
puree setting on it

33:27.806 --> 33:29.740
that sounded like a hundred
cats being strangled

33:29.742 --> 33:31.575
at the same time.

33:31.577 --> 33:34.211
I just fucking couldn't
take it anymore.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.180
Listen to that for
the rest of my life?

33:37.182 --> 33:39.383
Screw that noise, Mitch.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.818
- So, let me get this straight.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.220
You're the first person
in history to file

33:43.222 --> 33:48.158
for divorce on the grounds of
a faulty kitchen appliance.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.861
- Look, Mitch, I know it
hurts to see your role models

33:50.863 --> 33:54.398
crash and burn, but
you'll get over it.

33:57.935 --> 34:00.170
Do you know what it's
like to surround yourself

34:00.172 --> 34:02.305
with young women, Mitch?

34:03.374 --> 34:06.843
It's like swimming in
the fountain of youth.

34:06.845 --> 34:10.447
Do you know what young
women smell like, Mitch?

34:10.449 --> 34:12.616
- I pray you're not
going to tell me, Dunc.

34:12.618 --> 34:13.949
- Bubble gum.

34:14.851 --> 34:17.754
Bubble gum, and vanilla, Mitch.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.858
You know what women
our age smell like?

34:21.860 --> 34:23.726
Decaying medicine cabinets.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.795
- Well, I will
grant you this much,

34:25.797 --> 34:28.197
older women do go a little
heavy on the perfumes,

34:28.199 --> 34:29.599
that much is true.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.701
- I'm currently
seeing twins, Mitch.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.603
They both barely just turned 20.

34:33.605 --> 34:36.773
You probably have toothbrushes
older than that, Dunc.

34:36.775 --> 34:37.706
- Who cares?

34:37.708 --> 34:39.476
They practically worship me.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.944
The other day, Hey Jude,
by The Beatles came

34:40.946 --> 34:42.579
on the radio, and I
told one of the twins

34:42.581 --> 34:46.983
I wrote that song, she
thinks I'm a creative genius.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.955
- Hey, I can't believe I'm
hearing this, Dunc, I mean,

34:51.956 --> 34:54.623
beyond the blatant
musical plagiarism,

34:54.626 --> 34:56.393
I mean, I hate to
say this, Dunc,

34:56.395 --> 34:58.895
I think you're going
through a very severe male

34:58.897 --> 35:00.397
midlife crisis.

35:20.818 --> 35:22.486
- So Mitch.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.021
This acting thing, how did
you fall into that again?

35:25.023 --> 35:26.857
- Well, there's a huge
demand for actors of my

35:26.859 --> 35:28.992
particular demographics, Dunc.

35:28.994 --> 35:31.128
- You mean old dudes.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.699
- I mean, actors like
myself, who exude a certain

35:35.701 --> 35:37.834
experienced demeanor.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.170
Apparently, we're in
great demand, Dunc.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.806
- I'm guessing because
if somebody's a failure

35:42.808 --> 35:44.941
by your age, they
either give up acting,

35:44.943 --> 35:46.877
or kill themselves.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.080
Sorry, continue.

35:52.550 --> 35:54.384
- Well, I've been
taking acting classes

35:54.386 --> 35:55.719
for a few years now.

35:55.721 --> 36:00.190
Uh, the Method Style,
perhaps you've heard of it?

36:00.192 --> 36:02.859
Well, the Method Style,
uh, it basically involves

36:02.861 --> 36:06.196
the actor utilizing a
series of sensory exercises.

36:06.198 --> 36:09.499
You know, that allows the
actor, in this case, myself,

36:09.501 --> 36:12.802
uh, to engage on a
more honest level.

36:12.804 --> 36:16.806
- Okay, so, if a character
was, say, a loser,

36:16.808 --> 36:18.408
you could draw
inspiration from all those

36:18.410 --> 36:20.744
washed out auditions of yours.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.713
- Well, I suppose one
could, uh, conjure

36:23.715 --> 36:25.515
up those particular
incidents to enhance

36:25.517 --> 36:28.385
a scene's overall
verisimilitude.

36:30.988 --> 36:33.023
And then there's the
British style of acting.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.758
Based on its' rich
history of theater,

36:34.760 --> 36:37.360
treading the boards, we call it.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.663
- Whatever, look, it's
all the same to me.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.932
- If you don't mind
me saying so, Dunc,

36:41.934 --> 36:43.900
that's where you
show your ignorance.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.002
And to enlighten you,
between these two very

36:46.004 --> 36:48.572
distinct schools of
acting, let me show you

36:48.574 --> 36:50.173
an example of what
happened during the filming

36:50.175 --> 36:53.877
of a little movie I like
to call Marathon Man.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.445
- Never heard of it.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.379
- What?

36:56.381 --> 36:58.014
With the great Dusty Hoffman,

36:58.016 --> 37:00.550
and the iconic
Sir Larry Olivier?

37:00.552 --> 37:02.519
- Right, Dusty and Larry.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.188
Sounds like a lame
morning radio show.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.856
- There's this climactic
scene where Dusty's

37:06.858 --> 37:10.026
character finally
confronts Sir Larry's evil

37:10.028 --> 37:13.263
nasty dentist, in the
deep dark New York city

37:13.265 --> 37:15.031
sewer system.

37:15.033 --> 37:18.201
Apparently, Dusty, the
Method actor, had to do

37:18.203 --> 37:20.403
a whole ton of takes
because he couldn't find

37:20.405 --> 37:23.073
his emotional core, so finally,

37:24.075 --> 37:25.942
Sir Larry, nearly 80
years old and freezing

37:25.944 --> 37:29.212
in those sewers, and hailng
from the British style

37:29.214 --> 37:32.249
of theater, finally just
turns and looks at Dusty,

37:32.251 --> 37:36.019
and says, "Dusty, why
don't you try acting?"

37:37.321 --> 37:39.055
Can you believe that story?

37:39.057 --> 37:40.924
- You know, one thing
hasn't changed, Mitch.

37:40.926 --> 37:44.461
You still have that active
imagination of yours.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.663
- I remember the
sage words of my new

37:46.665 --> 37:48.665
acting coach, Dunc.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.967
Or was it my last acting coach?

37:50.969 --> 37:53.069
Uh, it might've
been my last one,

37:53.071 --> 37:55.739
hang on, no, well, my
first acting coach,

37:55.741 --> 37:59.909
uh, perished in a
mysterious airbag incident,

37:59.911 --> 38:01.845
and let me see, my
second one, oddly enough,

38:01.847 --> 38:03.947
got hit by lightning during
an outdoor production

38:03.949 --> 38:05.315
of The Tempest.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.783
Fancy that.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.318
- Just sounds like
working with you, Mitch,

38:08.320 --> 38:10.453
is a goddamned dangerous job.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.022
- Hey, the acting
world is no place

38:12.024 --> 38:13.923
for the diffident, Dunc.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.158
- And that's another thing.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.926
Using words like that.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.295
- What, diffident?

38:18.297 --> 38:19.529
It means shy.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.031
- Well, then why can't
you just say shy,

38:21.033 --> 38:22.766
for Christ's sake?

38:22.768 --> 38:24.000
Jesus.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.703
Who the fuck knows
what diffident means?

38:26.705 --> 38:28.171
You always did that,
you always were trying

38:28.173 --> 38:29.806
to impress people with
those ridiculously

38:29.808 --> 38:31.641
big words of yours.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.209
Hi, I'm Mitch, and
I've never been laid,

38:33.211 --> 38:36.646
but I've memorized every page
of the fucking dictionary.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.048
You know, ever
since the airport,

38:38.050 --> 38:40.050
you've been doing that.

38:40.052 --> 38:42.519
Diffident, versimilla, whatever.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.220
- Verisimilitude.

38:44.955 --> 38:46.156
- What?

38:46.158 --> 38:47.891
- It means truth.

38:49.727 --> 38:51.995
- It's all coming
back to me, Mitch.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.631
- Why I never bothered
to contact you

38:54.633 --> 38:56.599
for the last 30 years.

39:08.045 --> 39:10.146
- Well, I'm off
to the men's room.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.314
Hopefully they haven't
gotten rid of that

39:11.316 --> 39:14.117
over the last 30 years either.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.514
Yep, the men's
room's still there.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.082
Mind you, it doesn't
look like someone's

39:46.084 --> 39:49.719
ran a mop through there
since the JFK assassination.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.221
Hey, I didn't know you
wore glasses, Dunc.

39:51.223 --> 39:54.124
They make you look
rather avuncular,

39:54.126 --> 39:58.061
like someone's favorite
uncle or something.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.466
What are those for?

40:03.468 --> 40:04.868
Uh, allergies?

40:04.870 --> 40:07.137
I hope there's nothing
wrong with you, Dunc.

40:07.139 --> 40:08.171
- What these?

40:09.707 --> 40:11.574
Daddy's little helper, Mitch.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.443
With these blue pills,
we have the ability

40:13.445 --> 40:16.212
to beat God at his own game.

40:16.214 --> 40:19.949
Why God didn't want old
people having sex, Dunc?

40:19.951 --> 40:21.751
That's why he
invented scrapbooking.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.119
- Typical of you, Mitch.

40:23.121 --> 40:25.789
Always afraid of anything new.

40:25.791 --> 40:28.858
- What are you,
what are you doing?

40:31.095 --> 40:32.228
Why are you ingesting
those, I mean,

40:32.230 --> 40:33.596
you know we're
going straight home

40:33.598 --> 40:35.131
when we get out of
here, don't you, Dunc?

40:35.133 --> 40:36.633
I mean, I've got that
important audition

40:36.635 --> 40:38.101
tomorrow, I mean, I've
been talking about it

40:38.103 --> 40:39.803
all night.

40:39.805 --> 40:42.238
- Whoever wrote Go Gentle
Into That Good Night never

40:42.240 --> 40:46.376
experienced the joy of a
four hour hard on, Mitch.

40:48.179 --> 40:49.145
What?

40:49.147 --> 40:50.480
- I don't know.

40:50.482 --> 40:53.116
I, I feel like you're
going to turn into some

40:53.118 --> 40:56.119
kind of sex crazed
werewolf or something.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.189
- The medicine doesn't
work that fast, Mitch.

40:59.191 --> 41:01.591
And besides, you're not my type.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.593
Trust me.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.462
- Ah.

41:06.497 --> 41:07.664
- Hey, let me help
with that, Mitch.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.632
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.936
Hey, you don't pull a
coin in my town, Dunc.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.037
I got this.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.039
- Well, thanks.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.173
I'll get you later tonight.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.508
- What do you mean later?

41:18.510 --> 41:20.143
I mean, when we pack it in here,

41:20.145 --> 41:21.711
we're going back home, right?

41:21.713 --> 41:23.146
- Right.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.482
- Okay then, well,
let's make like a pair

41:25.484 --> 41:28.551
of skintight polyester
pants and split, Dunc.

41:28.553 --> 41:29.652
- Nice one.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.358
- Sorry about the absence
of uh, cinnamon in those

41:35.360 --> 41:36.759
coffees, Dunc.

41:38.129 --> 41:41.197
I'm going to wake up in
a cold sweat at the mere

41:41.199 --> 41:43.533
mention of cinnamon.

41:43.535 --> 41:46.035
- Ah, I don't know, but all
these things disappearing

41:46.037 --> 41:47.670
from the past, it's like, I
don't know, it could really

41:47.672 --> 41:49.372
disillusion a guy,
you know what I mean?

41:49.374 --> 41:51.407
- You're just figuring
that out, are you?

41:51.409 --> 41:52.542
- Yeah, oh.

41:53.978 --> 41:54.844
Oh, you know what?

41:54.846 --> 41:56.145
Hey wait.

41:56.147 --> 41:59.315
Ah, if you could help
run my lines with me,

41:59.317 --> 42:01.751
you know, for my big
audition tomorrow.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.486
That would be awesome
if you could do that.

42:03.488 --> 42:05.188
- Out here in the street?

42:05.190 --> 42:07.257
- Hey, I know it
sounds crazy, but.

42:10.094 --> 42:12.161
- I'd really
appreciate it, Dunc.

42:12.163 --> 42:15.098
- I don't think so, Mitch.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.102
- I mean, I mean, I'm
playing a cop, right?

42:19.104 --> 42:21.070
So being out here in the
mean streets, I mean,

42:21.072 --> 42:23.239
that's just going to help me
prepare for my role, right?

42:23.241 --> 42:26.442
I mean, listen, I mean,
right now, I can practically

42:26.444 --> 42:30.213
smell the danger
that's permeating on
the nocturnal city,

42:30.215 --> 42:31.414
as we speak.

42:35.185 --> 42:37.353
- I don't think so, Mitch.

42:39.524 --> 42:42.425
- I'd really
appreciate it, Dunc.

42:44.361 --> 42:45.128
- Okay.

42:45.130 --> 42:46.229
- Yes!

42:46.231 --> 42:47.231
Awesome.

42:50.301 --> 42:53.102
Here, got the script right here.

42:58.742 --> 43:00.543
You play the part of Romulus.

43:00.545 --> 43:01.711
- Romulus?

43:01.713 --> 43:03.780
What kind of a name is that?

43:03.782 --> 43:05.381
- It doesn't matter
what kind of name it is.

43:05.383 --> 43:06.649
Look, all you need to
know is that you're holed

43:06.651 --> 43:08.751
up in a public phone booth,
strapped to the gills

43:08.753 --> 43:11.254
with explosives, and
I'm the plucky, hardened

43:11.256 --> 43:14.223
detective who's assigned to
try to get you to surrender.

43:14.225 --> 43:16.893
- Right, Romulus,
I got it, Mitch.

43:16.895 --> 43:19.128
Okay, let's get this over with.

43:19.130 --> 43:20.130
- Great.

43:21.566 --> 43:22.566
Muah.

43:23.467 --> 43:24.267
Muah.

43:24.269 --> 43:25.501
Muah.

43:26.604 --> 43:27.904
- What are you doing?

43:27.906 --> 43:28.906
- Ah.

43:30.341 --> 43:33.276
This is my acting
exercises, Dunc.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.478
Every actor does this.

43:35.480 --> 43:39.315
- You look like a
chicken having a stroke.

43:40.751 --> 43:41.751
- Muah.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.554
Okay, okay.

43:45.856 --> 43:48.291
The name's Blutarsky,
Detective Blutarsky,

43:48.293 --> 43:51.194
from Headquarter's
Division, and, uh,

43:51.196 --> 43:53.763
listen buddy, just hand
over all those explosives

43:53.765 --> 43:57.200
and everybody gets out
of here alive, buddy.

43:57.202 --> 43:59.469
- Alright, okay,
two things Mitch.

43:59.471 --> 44:01.537
Alright, first you said
Headquarter's Division,

44:01.539 --> 44:04.007
it's supposed to be
Downtown Division.

44:04.009 --> 44:06.843
Second, it's not everyone
gets out of here alive,

44:06.845 --> 44:09.679
it's everyone gets out
of here in one piece.

44:09.681 --> 44:11.014
- Aw.

44:11.016 --> 44:12.482
- Don't sweat
it, Mitch, let's go.

44:12.484 --> 44:13.816
- No, no, no, no, no.

44:13.818 --> 44:16.552
I am going to nail
this sucker, Dunc.

44:18.222 --> 44:21.724
- Why the hell should I trust
a deadbeat cop like you?

44:21.726 --> 44:24.560
- You can't afford
to not not trust me.

44:24.562 --> 44:25.862
- Wait, Mitch.

44:25.864 --> 44:28.197
So, can he afford to
trust you, or not?

44:28.199 --> 44:30.400
I mean, it's very confusing,
the way it's written.

44:30.402 --> 44:32.635
- Oh, come on, Dunc,
you're taking me out of my

44:32.637 --> 44:34.303
actor's sacred zone.

44:34.305 --> 44:37.540
- Well, there's too
many nots in there.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.376
- Let's, let's just do
it one more time, Dunc,

44:40.378 --> 44:43.379
I promise, just one
more time, please.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.815
And, uh, if you don't
mind my saying so,

44:45.817 --> 44:47.383
possibly you could
imbue your character

44:47.385 --> 44:49.819
with a little more emotion?

44:49.821 --> 44:51.154
I kind of feel like
I'm carrying the scene

44:51.156 --> 44:53.923
for the both of us, Dunc.

45:13.744 --> 45:17.113
I mean, what's with all
these lame Hollywood movies,

45:17.115 --> 45:20.516
all these elderly protagonists,
and their bucket list.

45:20.518 --> 45:23.286
I mean, talk about
cliched screenwriting.

45:23.288 --> 45:26.389
I mean, they have these guys
like climbing Machu Picchu,

45:26.391 --> 45:29.292
and jumping out of
airplanes, parachuting.

45:29.294 --> 45:31.794
If there was even a shred
of truth to these movies,

45:31.796 --> 45:33.629
about their bucket lists,

45:33.631 --> 45:35.198
the number one thing that
these guys would want

45:35.200 --> 45:36.933
to be able to do is
actually have a painless

45:36.935 --> 45:38.534
bowel movement for once.

45:38.536 --> 45:41.070
Or, maybe even for once
eating a steak dinner

45:41.072 --> 45:43.639
without having to use a straw.

45:50.781 --> 45:52.448
You know, Dunc, it's
not as if I don't want

45:52.450 --> 45:54.650
to be in a relationship.

45:57.321 --> 46:00.490
I mean, I'm only
human, after all.

46:02.326 --> 46:04.160
- Mitch, turn right.

46:04.162 --> 46:05.495
- What?

46:05.497 --> 46:06.496
No, no, my, my place is
just straight this way.

46:06.498 --> 46:07.630
- No, no, I'm telling you,

46:07.632 --> 46:09.398
take a right at
the next turn off.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.567
- Dunc, I know where my
place is, it's just right.

46:11.569 --> 46:13.803
Wait, what are you
doing, are you crazy?

46:15.340 --> 46:16.606
Oh, Dunc.

46:17.341 --> 46:18.674
Look, I thought you were
trying to like hijack

46:18.676 --> 46:20.510
my car to Cuba.

46:20.512 --> 46:22.812
Hey, of all the preferred
ways I want to die,

46:22.814 --> 46:24.947
a fiery automobile crash
would not even rank

46:24.949 --> 46:26.916
in my top ten, trust me.

46:26.918 --> 46:29.485
- Just keep going straight
down this street, Mitch.

46:29.487 --> 46:31.854
- What's so important
about this street?

46:31.856 --> 46:35.458
- Just pull in right up here.

46:35.460 --> 46:37.460
- Come on, Dunc, I
have that big audition

46:37.462 --> 46:40.596
tomorrow at nine
a.m. sharp, remember?

46:40.598 --> 46:43.299
You've been yammering
endlessly about it

46:43.301 --> 46:44.834
since the airport.

46:44.836 --> 46:46.936
- Hey, this audition is
really important to me, Dunc.

46:46.938 --> 46:48.337
You know that.

46:49.873 --> 46:51.374
- Just pull in here.

46:51.376 --> 46:54.043
- What's so important I
have to pull into here?

46:54.045 --> 46:58.381
- Well, it's a lot more
exciting than cinnamon coffee.

46:58.383 --> 46:59.549
- That looks like the
apartment building

46:59.551 --> 47:01.384
from Rosemary's Baby.

47:03.053 --> 47:05.154
- Va voom, Mitch.

47:26.176 --> 47:27.643
- Ah, I don't know, Dunc.

47:27.645 --> 47:28.911
There better be a
minimum of three tires

47:28.913 --> 47:31.247
on that car when we return.

47:31.249 --> 47:33.015
Come on, Dunc, let's
just make like a pair

47:33.017 --> 47:36.819
of skintight trousers
and just tear ass!

47:36.821 --> 47:39.088
- Didn't you use
that one already?

47:39.090 --> 47:40.923
- Well, I actually
skintight trous,

47:40.925 --> 47:42.225
it doesn't matter.

47:42.227 --> 47:43.587
Let's just get out
of here, please.

47:45.864 --> 47:47.230
- Sh, sh, sh.

47:47.232 --> 47:48.497
Yes?

47:48.499 --> 47:50.066
- Vaya con dios?

47:51.201 --> 47:54.170
- What, you're all of a
sudden Antonio Banderas?

47:56.074 --> 47:57.074
- Bingo.

48:30.140 --> 48:32.708
Mitch, I believe
this is the one.

48:32.710 --> 48:34.477
Would you do us the
honor of knocking?

48:34.479 --> 48:35.711
- What, me knock?

48:35.713 --> 48:36.646
I don't want to knock.

48:36.648 --> 48:37.713
You knock.

48:37.715 --> 48:40.816
You're going to knock.

48:40.818 --> 48:42.251
Hey, there will be
nary any knocking

48:42.253 --> 48:44.654
eminating from me,
Dunc, trust me.

48:44.656 --> 48:49.725
- I think you've completely
lost your mind, Mitch.

48:49.727 --> 48:51.460
- Whoah, whoah,
whoah, wait, wait.

48:51.462 --> 48:52.595
Wait, just.

48:53.330 --> 48:54.630
- What's wrong, Mitch?

48:54.632 --> 48:56.232
- Look, let's just leave.

48:56.234 --> 48:58.334
I beseech you, Dunc,
I've got that audition

48:58.336 --> 49:00.436
really early tomorrow morning.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.171
- Shit, not that again.

49:02.173 --> 49:04.173
- Hey, if I don't get at
least two and a half hours

49:04.175 --> 49:06.842
sleep before a big audition,
I get cranky, Dunc.

49:06.844 --> 49:10.613
- Trust me, Mitch, the universe
is unfolding as it should.

49:10.615 --> 49:11.948
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

49:11.950 --> 49:12.848
Wait.

49:12.850 --> 49:14.417
- You're killing me, Mitch.

49:14.419 --> 49:16.018
- I knew I heard
that earlier tonight,

49:16.020 --> 49:19.021
the vaya con dios,
at the airport.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.557
- Vaya con dios.

49:23.527 --> 49:24.827
- And I know this
sounds crazy, but

49:24.829 --> 49:27.496
I got solicited for fellatio
by Dr. Strange Love's

49:27.498 --> 49:29.065
twin sister, Dunc.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.668
- You know, Mitch, you're right.

49:32.670 --> 49:33.970
- What, that you believe me?

49:33.972 --> 49:35.638
Huh, thanks, Dunc.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.873
- No, that you sound crazy.

49:38.775 --> 49:39.775
Come on.

49:40.711 --> 49:41.711
- Well, wait, wait.

49:41.713 --> 49:43.713
Now that I think about it,

49:43.715 --> 49:45.548
there were a myriad of strange

49:45.550 --> 49:47.350
happenings at the
airport tonight.

49:55.892 --> 49:57.493
I feel like this is all
some kind of a cosmic

49:57.495 --> 49:59.362
warning sign, Dunc.

49:59.364 --> 50:00.730
We can't go in there.

50:00.732 --> 50:03.065
Let's just make like
a couple of large

50:03.067 --> 50:06.369
breasted women on a
trampoline and bounce.

50:06.371 --> 50:07.870
- Ah, boy.

50:07.872 --> 50:09.171
- I don't know, I just
feel like whatever is

50:09.173 --> 50:10.072
on the other side
of that door, Dunc,

50:10.074 --> 50:12.208
is going to be either A, bad.

50:12.210 --> 50:13.509
B, trouble.

50:13.511 --> 50:16.012
C, causing one or more
of our private parts

50:16.014 --> 50:17.413
to end up leaking.

50:17.415 --> 50:19.548
Or D, all of the above.

50:20.684 --> 50:24.920
- What do I have to do to get
you through that door, Mitch?

50:24.922 --> 50:26.989
- What do you mean?

50:26.991 --> 50:29.425
- You name it, I'll do anything.

50:29.427 --> 50:30.760
We haven't seen
each other, in what?

50:30.762 --> 50:32.395
30 years, right?

50:32.397 --> 50:36.665
Come on, I really need you
with me on this, Mitch.

50:36.667 --> 50:37.900
- Aw.

50:39.069 --> 50:40.569
You'll do anything?

50:40.571 --> 50:42.571
- Anything, I promise.

50:44.107 --> 50:45.875
- Okay, I got it.

50:50.380 --> 50:53.849
Ah, I still don't feel
good about this, Dunc.

50:53.851 --> 50:55.851
- Trust me, Mitch, you badly
need what's on the other

50:55.853 --> 50:59.055
side of this door
more than anybody.

51:02.693 --> 51:04.493
- Yes.

51:16.741 --> 51:19.742
Since my audition for
that failed musical

51:19.744 --> 51:21.777
production of Last
Tango In Paris.

51:21.779 --> 51:22.578
- Shh.

51:22.580 --> 51:23.879
What?

51:23.881 --> 51:24.814
They were really
going to do that?

51:24.816 --> 51:26.282
- Yeah, you bet, Dunc.

51:26.284 --> 51:27.650
I was trying out for the chorus.

51:27.652 --> 51:29.385
They had this big
showstopping musical number

51:29.387 --> 51:30.686
about butter.

51:39.096 --> 51:41.097
- Bienvenidos, welcome.

51:42.132 --> 51:44.834
- Good evening, senoritas.

51:44.836 --> 51:46.035
- Senoritas?

51:47.003 --> 51:48.404
You must think you're
addressing a room full

51:48.406 --> 51:50.773
of, senor.

51:50.775 --> 51:54.810
Trust me, there are no
virgins here, Senor.

51:54.812 --> 51:58.447
- Oh, we wouldn't dream of
insulting you lovely ladies.

51:58.449 --> 51:59.849
Would we?

51:59.851 --> 52:02.785
But my long lost friend and
I here are in humble need

52:02.787 --> 52:06.622
of some of your spicy, Latin
company for the evening.

52:06.624 --> 52:07.990
- You know what?

52:07.992 --> 52:10.426
I just remembered,
I'm pretty sure I left

52:10.428 --> 52:12.828
a teakettle on, Dunc.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.697
- Don't mind my friend,
he's just not used

52:14.699 --> 52:18.300
to seeing so much
beauty in one room.

52:18.302 --> 52:22.037
- Flattery might get
you somewhere, mister.

52:22.039 --> 52:23.772
- Uh, I think the
expression is flattery

52:23.774 --> 52:25.674
will get you nowhere.

52:26.943 --> 52:29.044
- One moment, ladies.

52:29.046 --> 52:31.814
What the fuck are
you doing, Mitch?

52:31.816 --> 52:34.216
- What, I mean, it's
obvious that English

52:34.218 --> 52:36.719
is not their primary
language, Dunc.

52:36.721 --> 52:38.787
I'm, I'm just correcting
their idioms, that's all.

52:38.789 --> 52:41.891
- Well, lay off with the fucking
Berlitz lesson, will you?

52:41.893 --> 52:45.027
You are not going
to sabotage this.

52:46.796 --> 52:47.796
I'm sorry.

52:48.798 --> 52:50.065
- Well, all I can say,

52:50.067 --> 52:53.035
relax, you only just arrived.

52:53.037 --> 52:54.503
Don't waste our charity.

52:54.505 --> 52:56.805
It is all, uh, good,

52:56.807 --> 52:58.507
as you say here.

52:58.509 --> 52:59.909
Would you like to see a menu?

53:03.914 --> 53:06.382
- Oh, oh, no thanks,
late night repast,

53:06.384 --> 53:08.984
they just wreak havoc
with my digestive tract.

53:08.986 --> 53:10.886
- I'd be delighted.

53:30.740 --> 53:33.943
Okay, I'll have the Bay
of Pigs Massage Combo,

53:33.945 --> 53:36.679
preferably with a redhead,
and my friend here

53:36.681 --> 53:40.883
is going to have the Nude
Reverse Simón Bolívar.

53:40.885 --> 53:41.885
- What?

53:51.394 --> 53:54.797
- Don't worry, we'll take
care of your shy friend.

53:54.799 --> 53:56.932
Meanwhile, you'll find
everything waiting for you,

53:56.934 --> 53:58.300
down there.

53:58.302 --> 53:59.368
- Thanks.

53:59.370 --> 54:00.903
I mean, gracias.

54:03.039 --> 54:05.140
Mitch, many are chosen,

54:06.610 --> 54:08.277
but few are called.

54:09.279 --> 54:12.848
- I don't even know
what that means, Dunc.

54:19.789 --> 54:22.791
- Have a seat,
Senor Mitch, is it?

54:23.793 --> 54:25.160
- I don't believe I
actually told you my.

54:25.162 --> 54:27.563
- Por favor, Senor
Mitch, pull up a stump

54:27.565 --> 54:29.298
as they say.

54:29.300 --> 54:31.100
- Um, you know what?

54:32.269 --> 54:34.937
I think that, uh, and I
appreciate all of your

54:34.939 --> 54:36.939
hospitality, uh,

54:36.941 --> 54:40.109
mucho gracias, but, uh,
I think, uh, I'm actually

54:40.111 --> 54:41.343
going to stand.

54:41.345 --> 54:42.645
You know, I'm good.

54:42.647 --> 54:44.346
- You don't look so good.

54:44.348 --> 54:45.948
- Uh.

54:51.288 --> 54:52.688
Um.

54:52.690 --> 54:53.690
Hm.

55:03.166 --> 55:05.134
You know, I've heard of
Goldfinger, but I think

55:05.136 --> 55:07.970
you've got the hole hand here.

55:08.672 --> 55:09.672
- Yes.

55:12.609 --> 55:14.643
- You know, yeah, I
really love what you've

55:14.645 --> 55:18.347
It's kind of a Martha Stewart
meets early Che Guevara

55:18.349 --> 55:20.349
School of Home Design.

55:24.888 --> 55:28.657
What do you know about
Marxism, Senor Mitch?

55:28.659 --> 55:30.626
- Well other than it's
a political system based

55:30.628 --> 55:32.895
on the collective masses,
founded on the fundamental

55:32.897 --> 55:35.230
principles of egalitarianism,
and the collapse

55:35.232 --> 55:37.499
of the capitalistic
free market state,

55:37.501 --> 55:39.335
not much, I guess.

55:43.573 --> 55:44.907
- Do you know what the
fucking communist pigs

55:44.909 --> 55:47.409
who stole our country have done?

55:47.411 --> 55:50.846
We had the most best golf
courses in all of the world,

55:50.848 --> 55:52.815
and they let dogs and the
fucking peasants squat

55:52.817 --> 55:56.018
Then end up pissing and
shitting all over our beautiful

55:56.020 --> 55:57.553
putting greens.

55:59.055 --> 56:01.857
- Well, hey, you have to admit,
some of those private golf

56:01.859 --> 56:04.360
memberships are a tad pricey.

56:05.195 --> 56:06.995
- But not reciprocal,
Senor Mitch.

56:06.997 --> 56:09.865
Someday soon, our
country will be returned

56:09.867 --> 56:11.433
to its' rightful glory.

56:11.435 --> 56:13.202
Those gutless red devils
will be driven back

56:13.204 --> 56:15.170
to there, and our
beloved Generalissimo.

56:15.172 --> 56:17.272
Will rule us once more.

56:37.927 --> 56:40.062
That day is coming,
Senor Mitch, when we will

56:40.064 --> 56:42.798
once again be a,

56:42.800 --> 56:46.135
the best country in the world.

56:46.137 --> 56:49.104
- Wow, I mean, best
country in the world?

56:49.106 --> 56:50.739
That's quite the bold statement.

56:50.741 --> 56:52.441
I mean, take for instance
even a tiny country

56:52.443 --> 56:53.976
like Belgium.

56:53.978 --> 56:56.211
I mean, uh, they
practically cornered

56:56.213 --> 56:57.980
the international beer market.

56:57.982 --> 57:01.116
And let's not forget their
prodigious chocolate production.

57:01.118 --> 57:03.986
We haven't even gotten to
the topic of waffles yet.

57:03.988 --> 57:07.055
I always have a hard
time evenly distributing

57:07.057 --> 57:10.559
the butter through
all the pastry divots.

57:10.561 --> 57:11.660
- Try this.

57:13.096 --> 57:15.330
We call it Mala Leche.

57:23.007 --> 57:26.742
- Um, no thanks, I
generally don't partake

57:26.744 --> 57:29.344
of any fermented reptile
beverages after six p.m.

57:29.346 --> 57:30.346
Sorry.

57:35.752 --> 57:37.453
- To our beloved Generalissimo.

57:37.455 --> 57:38.455
Salute.

57:42.492 --> 57:44.426
- Well, I'd love to
continue this fascinating

57:44.428 --> 57:46.161
chin wagging, but all
the interesting aspects

57:46.163 --> 57:48.697
of your culture,
but, you know what?

57:48.699 --> 57:50.499
I think I'm just going to
grab my buddy over there,

57:50.501 --> 57:53.202
and I think I'm going to just
like mosey on out of here.

57:53.204 --> 57:54.636
Yep, it's been great.

57:58.174 --> 58:00.442
- And Lady Grizelda was
the most feared member

58:00.444 --> 58:03.178
of Generalissimo's
secret police.

58:03.180 --> 58:05.881
They used to call
her The Nutcracker.

58:05.883 --> 58:08.217
Those legs have crushed
the hopes of revolutionary

58:08.219 --> 58:11.353
scum like so many
fucking walnuts.

58:11.355 --> 58:13.889
Will you, will you hear me?

58:14.891 --> 58:16.558
Senor Mitch?

58:16.560 --> 58:18.393
You men in this country,

58:18.395 --> 58:20.896
where we come from our men are

58:20.898 --> 58:22.998
with cocks like stallions.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.200
Not like you, always
trying to be all sensitive,

58:25.202 --> 58:28.070
with your puny little
dicks like hummingbirds.

58:28.072 --> 58:30.806
If our men likes the
way a woman looks,

58:30.808 --> 58:32.474
they would fuck her
right there in the street

58:32.476 --> 58:34.076
like a wild animal.

58:34.078 --> 58:35.377
- Well, at least that
beats a whole evening

58:35.379 --> 58:37.079
of speed dating.

58:40.184 --> 58:41.184
- Sarcasm.

58:45.890 --> 58:48.590
- Well, Senor Sarcasm,
it appears that you

58:48.592 --> 58:52.160
and your friend will be our
guests for some time yet.

58:52.162 --> 58:54.162
- Well, what, I can't stay here.

58:54.164 --> 58:55.430
I have an appointment
of the utmost importance

58:55.432 --> 58:56.965
in the morning.

58:57.934 --> 59:01.370
- Have you ever heard
a mini sequestro?

59:01.372 --> 59:04.540
It means itty bitty kidnapping.

59:04.542 --> 59:07.276
Well, at least until we
clean all your ATM accounts.

59:07.278 --> 59:10.112
Generalissimo thanks
you in advance for your

59:10.114 --> 59:12.347
generous contribution.

59:12.349 --> 59:13.916
- Wait, what, I
don't have any money.

59:13.918 --> 59:16.351
I mean, hey, I mean,
just the other day

59:16.353 --> 59:17.686
I had to put down my pet budgie

59:17.688 --> 59:21.590
because I couldn't even
afford the vet bills.

59:22.225 --> 59:25.193
- We call her LaMuta, the mute.

59:25.195 --> 59:27.229
Because those red
motherfucking cowards

59:27.231 --> 59:29.197
cut out her tongue.

59:29.199 --> 59:33.235
Chimmy, show Mr. Mitch
what they did to you.

59:37.206 --> 59:39.808
- Nah, that's okay, I don't.

59:46.383 --> 59:47.282
What the jacket?

59:47.284 --> 59:48.383
No, not the jacket.

59:48.385 --> 59:49.251
Well, uh, hey, hey, what.

59:49.253 --> 59:50.452
Oh, come on.

59:52.155 --> 59:53.355
I need that.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.429
- What is that?

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:04.132
Eggs?

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:06.301
- Oh, I forgot those were
in there from earlier.

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:07.235
What are you doing?

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:08.437
Aw, come on.

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.314
- What's this?

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:21.683
- Uh, that's my
actor's headshot.

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:23.785
Please be careful with that.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:27.923
- So, you like to play
act for a living, no?

01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:29.625
Like Peter Pan, no?

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:36.632
Do you think women want to
fuck Peter Pan, Senor Mitch?

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:39.768
Over here, tell us
something interesting

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.003
about this acting of yours.

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:43.438
Por favor, Senor Mitch.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.209
- Um, something interesting
about my acting.

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:51.813
Well, uh, actually, to
best illustrate the two

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.650
distinct styles of acting, um,

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:57.619
maybe I could tell
you a little story

01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:00.389
about what happened on
the set of a little film,

01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:02.324
I like to call, Marathon Man.

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:05.193
So, you have Dusty
Hoffman, who hails from the

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:07.696
Method style of acting,

01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:11.500
and he's doing this scene
with Sir Larry Olivier,

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:13.802
who hails from the more
traditional British style

01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:15.203
of acting.

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:18.173
And uh, he, he couldn't
find his emotional core,

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:21.743
and, and, so, he, uh,
turned to Dusty, and

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:28.950
and said to him, he said,
"Dusty, why don't you

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:31.586
"try acting?"

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:36.258
Um, acting, to
Dusty, he said that.

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:45.500
- So, Senor Mitch,
this is your legacy?

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:48.870
All this childish
play, and the endless.

01:01:53.744 --> 01:01:56.511
- I believe the word
you're looking for is

01:01:56.513 --> 01:01:57.846
whining.

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:58.848
- Si.

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:04.086
All these endless whining
this is your puny legacy.

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:05.088
No?

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.458
- We are here to remember

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.827
our dearly departed, Mitch,

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.530
who tried his best, but,

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:19.267
alas, his best was
far from good enough.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:20.902
Hiding behind the last refuge

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.605
of the insignificant sarcasm,

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:27.709
Mitch's minuscule
abilities as an actor,

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:29.411
were matched only
by his diminutive

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:31.580
and seldom used genitalia.

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:36.084
A daydreamer, bereft
of any lasting

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.652
human relationships,

01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:41.456
not to mention a
euthanizer of pet birds.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:44.259
Mitch's legacy sadly is doomed

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.762
to be remembered by no one.

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:47.856
- Mm, mm, mm, mm.

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:51.626
Oh, God, oh thank, oh.

01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:52.828
Thank, gracias.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:53.662
Gracias.

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:54.996
Ah, ah, ah.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:58.533
I'm an actor, actoral,
I, I have an, a big

01:03:58.535 --> 01:03:59.835
audition, no,

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.704
I have to go, big audition.

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:04.406
Aw, come on, Mitch.

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:05.707
Look, I sound like Tarzan.

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:08.510
Uh, uh, Marlon Brando, uh,

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:10.478
Robert De Niro.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.180
Come on, Mitch, no, no, no.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.583
Come on, who do
young people like?

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:16.518
Ah, ah, Seth Rogen.

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:18.753
Seth Rogen.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:22.057
Seth Rogen, si, yes, yes, yes.

01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:22.858
Please.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.860
Oh, yes.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.628
Ah, ah, ah.

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.799
Thank you, ah, ah, ah.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.592
Oh.

01:05:02.032 --> 01:05:03.131
Dunc, Dunc.

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:05.367
We've got to go.

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:06.635
Dunc.

01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:08.904
- What the fuck do
you want, Mitch?

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:10.639
- We, we got to go, like,
I think you brought us

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:12.774
to some paramilitary
Hooters or something.

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:13.775
We've got to go.

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:16.611
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:20.715
Jesus, that Anaconda
hooch kicks like a mule.

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:22.784
Get the hell out of here.

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:34.095
- Dunc.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.264
We hardly knew ye.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.527
Where's my car?

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:40.862
- Someone better hurry if he's

01:06:40.864 --> 01:06:43.064
going to make that audition.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:44.632
- What?

01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:45.667
How do you know about that?

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:49.871
- Please, Sir, time
is of the essence.

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:45.460
I believe we've arrived, Sir.

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:48.930
Oh, and hey.

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:50.965
Don't forget to, um,

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.070
break a leg, as they say.

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:09.017
- Ah.

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:19.794
My name's Blutarsky,
Detective Blutarsky.

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:22.897
- Who are you?

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:26.067
- My name's Blutarsky,
Detective Blutarsky,

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:27.902
from Downtown Division.

01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:28.636
- No.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:29.837
Who are you?

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:35.276
- What, my name's
Mitch, uh, I'm an actor,

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.845
I'm playing the part
of Detective Blutarsky.

01:08:37.848 --> 01:08:39.613
Are you asking me the
character I'm playing,

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.483
Detective Blutarsky, or are
you asking my actor's name,

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:44.853
Mitch, I mean, what are
you asking me, I mean.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:48.423
- Who the fuck are you?

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:50.524
- Detective Blutarsky.

01:08:50.527 --> 01:08:51.693
That's who I'm playing.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.962
- I said, who are you?

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:56.930
- Oh, God.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.635
I don't know.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.645
- What do I have
to do to get you

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:13.281
through that door, Mitch?

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:14.916
- What do you mean?

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.354
- You name it, I'll
do anything you want.

01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:20.889
I mean, we haven't seen
each other for what?

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:21.890
30 years?

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:26.127
But I really need you
with me on this, Mitch.

01:09:26.129 --> 01:09:27.328
- Well.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.830
You'll do anything?

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:29.731
- You name it.

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:30.999
I promise.

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:35.170
- Okay, I got it.

01:09:36.971 --> 01:09:37.738
- Great.

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:39.140
What is it?

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:43.810
Aw, no, Mitch, not that.

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:44.845
- What?

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:46.981
You promised, Dunc.
