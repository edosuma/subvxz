WEBVTT

02:09.262 --> 02:10.931
Mom always said
she never belonged here

02:10.965 --> 02:16.169
with me and Daddy, that the
river stink drove her crazy.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.276
She had to go find
herself, she said.

02:26.213 --> 02:27.515
And she couldn't do that here.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.571
Daddy and I were doing
our best to get by.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.176
I know it was hard for him,
taking care of me on his own.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.614
He quit drinking the
day we found mom's note.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.686
Maybe what happened
was bound to happen.

03:05.987 --> 03:07.220
Like destiny.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.869
A year had gone by,
I had just turned 15

03:22.837 --> 03:24.505
and I missed Mom all the time.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.509
The way she smelled of
cocoa butter and white wine.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.280
But Daddy and I
couldn't talk about it.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.839
Not bad, kiddo.

03:57.872 --> 03:59.239
You're starting to scare me.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.309
What's the main rule again?

04:02.342 --> 04:04.979
Only make the good
shot, not just any shot.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.413
That's right.

04:06.446 --> 04:09.249
Listen to your
breathing, to your body,

04:10.450 --> 04:12.820
it'll tell you when
the time is right.

04:14.055 --> 04:16.824
It's an art form,
not just sport.

04:40.982 --> 04:44.085
Murrayville,
Michigan, was a company town.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.286
My dad's half-brother,
Cal Murray,

04:47.889 --> 04:49.389
pretty much ran the place.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.064
We lived right next
door to the Murrays.

04:57.098 --> 04:58.633
Go, Margo!

04:58.666 --> 05:00.367
- Good luck, river nymph.
- Woo!

05:07.875 --> 05:09.342
That is unholy.

05:14.015 --> 05:15.716
Your granddad
would be so proud.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.454
Here.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.025
Try that.

05:30.064 --> 05:30.898
Hold up.

05:38.940 --> 05:41.408
- That was beginner's luck.
- Yeah.

05:43.911 --> 05:44.812
This will be good.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.559
Hey.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.564
You wanna come hunt
with me for opening day?

06:05.432 --> 06:06.433
You're gonna go
hunting with her?

06:06.466 --> 06:07.802
Are you kidding me, Dad?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.070
- Billy.
- Are you kidding me?

06:09.103 --> 06:10.504
Shut it.

06:10.538 --> 06:11.371
She's family.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.511
Well, think about it.

06:18.478 --> 06:19.513
It'll be fun.

06:22.449 --> 06:23.483
Give me that.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.154
Think it over and
tell me tonight.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.396
It's mine.

06:38.099 --> 06:40.101
You know, you're lucky
we even help you.

06:43.638 --> 06:45.773
- Come on, Billy.
- Shut it, Junior!

06:45.806 --> 06:46.674
It's the truth.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.777
And don't you forget it.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.711
This is it, Margo.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.948
Hunting season hasn't
even started yet.

07:26.981 --> 07:27.815
We'll get fined.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.952
I'll get you whatever
target you want, okay?

07:30.985 --> 07:32.687
Just no more kill.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.587
You hear me?

07:33.621 --> 07:34.454
I heard you.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.554
That dress looks nice.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.128
Having fun?

09:14.155 --> 09:17.958
You know, sprite, if
you wanna go huntin'

09:19.360 --> 09:22.596
you better learn
how to skin a deer.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.635
Teach you right now if you want.

09:31.405 --> 09:34.308
Coming with me at
five a.m., right?

09:36.210 --> 09:37.278
I'd like to, yes.

10:42.276 --> 10:44.311
You're so lovely, Margaret.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.283
Is this your first time?

10:58.826 --> 11:01.695
Uncle Cal.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.784
Uncle Cal?

11:23.817 --> 11:26.787
It's all right, I was careful.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.190
But, Uncle Cal, did you see...

11:31.892 --> 11:33.761
You dirty son of a bitch!

11:34.428 --> 11:39.200
Dad!

11:39.233 --> 11:40.067
Dad!

11:43.070 --> 11:44.772
- Mom!
- What's going on?

11:57.184 --> 11:59.787
The devil's slut
lured me in there,

11:59.820 --> 12:01.722
but I swear I never
touched her, Jo.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.165
Guess she's just
like her mama, huh?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.466
You shut that mouth of yours.

12:15.269 --> 12:16.103
Margo!

12:17.572 --> 12:19.507
What the hell...

12:19.541 --> 12:21.075
What the hell are you doing?

12:21.108 --> 12:24.478
Stay away from my family!

13:11.258 --> 13:12.092
Margo.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.531
Come on, now.

13:16.564 --> 13:17.398
Let's go.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.611
Hey, nympho, why don't
you meet me in the shed?

15:09.644 --> 15:13.013
I have something to show
you later, all right?

15:13.046 --> 15:18.051
I'll see you there!

15:51.619 --> 15:52.754
Tomorrow I
wanna talk to you about

15:52.787 --> 15:53.688
another creepy
crawly animal that's

15:53.721 --> 15:55.022
found right near Pronto Valley,

15:55.055 --> 15:56.591
and that'll be tarantulas.

15:56.624 --> 15:58.258
Now, tarantulas are
types of spiders

15:58.292 --> 16:00.127
that are related to
things like black widows,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.996
brown recluses, wolf
spiders and jumping spiders.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.767
Spiders belong to a group of
animals known as arachnids.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.101
All arachnids are
invertebrate animals,

16:08.135 --> 16:10.137
which means they
lack a backbone.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.706
Vertebrate animals
include mammals, reptiles,

16:11.739 --> 16:14.041
fish, and amphibians and birds.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.109
All insects and arachnids
are invertebrates,

16:16.143 --> 16:19.112
- which means-
- I'll bring him right up!

16:19.146 --> 16:21.783
Well, I hope you
come visit us in California.

16:21.816 --> 16:24.051
Mighty glad to see
you, especially Pearl.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.085
Pearl, you got the green cov-

16:38.700 --> 16:42.570
Margo, you know,
you're the only reason

16:42.604 --> 16:44.806
I'm alive and sober
in this world.

16:44.839 --> 16:46.774
I know that, Daddy.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.727
Margo!

17:39.761 --> 17:40.595
Margo!

17:43.163 --> 17:44.398
Dad!

17:44.431 --> 17:46.466
Margo,
where are you?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.468
I'm right here.

17:48.503 --> 17:49.737
Why do you have your gun?

17:52.640 --> 17:53.841
They told me you
weren't at school.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.679
Just stay where I can
see you from now on.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.864
Sparkler.

18:17.865 --> 18:19.166
Do mine.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.769
Because I was always... okay.

18:24.706 --> 18:26.440
All right, then,
I'm going to work.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.215
If I catch you going
over I'm dragging

18:35.248 --> 18:36.551
you back by your ears.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.167
More of this, Nicholas!

18:54.201 --> 18:55.870
You're doing it!

19:15.222 --> 19:18.191
Your dad said you've become
quite the hunter, Maggie.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.594
Crackshot with the rifle.

19:20.962 --> 19:22.597
That's my brother, Paul.

19:22.630 --> 19:24.899
Paulie, meet my dream girl.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.401
The prettiest
thing on the river.

19:28.636 --> 19:30.938
I'm keeping him off
the junk, Maggie.

19:30.972 --> 19:32.974
No need for speed out here
unless it's in your boat,

19:33.007 --> 19:34.441
- right?
- Hey, don't tell her that

19:34.474 --> 19:35.475
for Christ's sake.

19:35.510 --> 19:37.244
Come on.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.246
She ain't gonna tell anyone.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.380
Just about got him cured, too.

19:40.414 --> 19:42.850
Will you shut
the fuck up, Brian?

19:48.422 --> 19:49.691
There you go.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.798
You know, I just can't get
enough of a girl who don't talk.

20:19.020 --> 20:20.788
That's right, baby.

20:23.725 --> 20:28.730
Yes, yes!

22:47.535 --> 22:49.436
Margo!

22:57.144 --> 22:58.613
Dad?

23:04.585 --> 23:06.419
Are you over there, Margo?

23:06.453 --> 23:07.454
Put that down, Billy.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.690
You shot my dad, you asshole.

23:09.724 --> 23:12.459
- What are you talking about?
- Billy, no.

23:12.492 --> 23:13.426
- Don't point that at me.
- No.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.129
Put that down before
somebody gets hurt.

24:04.178 --> 24:06.213
Margo, are
you okay in there?

24:06.247 --> 24:07.480
Just give me a second.

24:07.515 --> 24:09.517
Sheriff's here.

24:09.550 --> 24:11.185
You gotta talk to him.

24:11.218 --> 24:14.221
I'll be right there.

25:37.605 --> 25:38.305
Who's out there?

25:42.676 --> 25:44.078
Shit.

25:44.111 --> 25:46.080
Brian, what's a girl
doing here holding a gun?

25:46.113 --> 25:48.182
Paulie, open your eye.

25:49.050 --> 25:50.151
Maggie Crane.

25:54.622 --> 25:56.290
Get in here and
put your gun down.

25:56.323 --> 25:58.993
Hey, you came just in
time for my winning hand.

26:00.261 --> 26:01.162
Just have a seat.

26:06.300 --> 26:07.668
Shit.

26:07.701 --> 26:10.971
We heard about your
dad and we're so sorry.

26:19.947 --> 26:21.649
None of them Murrays
are fit to lick

26:21.682 --> 26:23.017
your father's boots, you hear?

26:25.152 --> 26:26.053
You remember that.

26:32.393 --> 26:33.861
Where you headed, Maggie?

26:35.262 --> 26:36.363
Trying to get to my mom.

26:38.732 --> 26:40.134
I have this.

26:40.167 --> 26:41.602
Mentions Heart of Pines.

26:50.177 --> 26:54.348
Well, I can drop you at
Heart of Pines tomorrow.

26:55.950 --> 26:57.284
We'll find your mom.

26:57.318 --> 26:59.019
What if they
report her missing?

27:00.387 --> 27:01.922
You are asking for trouble.

27:05.759 --> 27:09.630
Well, I'm not asking for
your opinion on anything, so...

27:13.968 --> 27:16.971
You stay here tonight,
make yourself at home.

27:57.011 --> 28:00.781
I was thinking
about it last night.

28:00.814 --> 28:02.950
So, why would your dad
have shot Cal like that?

28:09.990 --> 28:10.925
He mess with you?

28:19.934 --> 28:21.435
He did, didn't he?

28:41.055 --> 28:42.990
Wish I could tell
you where Luanne is.

28:43.023 --> 28:45.059
She ran off with a
guy I used to know.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.062
That's all I got for you.

28:48.095 --> 28:49.763
She may be out to
Florida by now.

28:50.864 --> 28:51.765
That was her plan.

28:52.567 --> 28:54.034
But so was Lake Lynne.

29:06.847 --> 29:07.481
Hey.

29:09.917 --> 29:11.085
We will find her.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.841
So, what are
we hoping to find here?

30:07.875 --> 30:10.277
To see if somebody's
home, ask some questions.

30:33.300 --> 30:37.137
Come on,
we'll come back tomorrow.

33:50.497 --> 33:52.499
Margo the river nymph.

33:55.837 --> 33:57.404
I've been looking for you.

33:59.841 --> 34:02.075
Get away from my boat.

34:02.109 --> 34:03.477
It's not your boat.

34:03.511 --> 34:04.846
A Murray boat does not belong to

34:04.879 --> 34:06.848
a part-Indian bastard like you.

34:06.881 --> 34:11.184
Grandpa gave me that
boat, and you know it.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.085
You going to find your ma?

34:15.657 --> 34:17.324
I mean, I guess
that makes sense.

34:18.793 --> 34:22.161
You two should stick together
seeing as you're both whores.

34:22.195 --> 34:23.531
Shut up.

34:23.565 --> 34:28.168
I saw her with my dad
a bunch in the shed.

34:29.837 --> 34:33.407
He said not to tell you, but
I don't really give a fuck.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.208
And then she ran
off with some man.

34:36.443 --> 34:38.277
She didn't care about you.

34:39.647 --> 34:40.480
Shut up.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.250
You don't know anything.

34:43.283 --> 34:46.621
Aren't you even sorry
that you killed my dad?

34:46.654 --> 34:48.188
I didn't have a choice.

34:48.221 --> 34:49.524
He shot my dad.

34:53.226 --> 34:55.128
I was the one
who shot your dad.

34:57.565 --> 34:58.866
No.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.902
- No, everybody saw-
- I...

35:00.935 --> 35:03.136
I was the one who shot your dad.

35:07.909 --> 35:09.844
You is being crazy.

35:22.624 --> 35:24.257
You can kill me if you want.

35:29.864 --> 35:31.599
Kinda wish you would.

36:54.716 --> 36:56.751
Hi, I'm looking for Luanne.

36:59.020 --> 37:00.353
I'm Margo, her daughter.

37:03.290 --> 37:03.925
Yes.

38:27.141 --> 38:29.076
Now, why on Earth
is a girl skinning

38:29.110 --> 38:30.745
a rabbit in a picnic park?

38:33.080 --> 38:36.416
I'm not afraid of protecting
myself when I have to, okay?

38:37.852 --> 38:40.420
Listen, if that meat's
safe, I'll pay for it.

38:41.421 --> 38:42.056
Deal.

38:49.697 --> 38:50.998
Tell me when they're gone.

38:56.838 --> 38:57.672
They're gone.

39:05.646 --> 39:06.479
What tribe?

39:08.616 --> 39:09.449
I'm not sure.

39:10.718 --> 39:11.886
Somewhere out west.

39:14.188 --> 39:16.090
I'm Cherokee from Oklahoma.

39:16.123 --> 39:19.093
I'm studying the routes
from Canada on down.

39:19.126 --> 39:20.360
Why?

39:22.462 --> 39:23.430
What's your name?

39:25.933 --> 39:26.767
Margo.

39:27.969 --> 39:29.837
Let me tell you
something, Margo.

39:29.871 --> 39:31.906
People who came to this
country and took over,

39:31.939 --> 39:33.841
they never intended
for us to survive.

39:37.044 --> 39:38.512
That's what I've been learning.

39:40.047 --> 39:41.448
My name's Will, by the way.

39:45.953 --> 39:46.954
This is really good.

39:49.624 --> 39:51.626
Thank you, Margo.

39:51.659 --> 39:52.526
You're welcome.

39:54.195 --> 39:56.097
Tomorrow I can
fish us some trout.

39:57.464 --> 39:59.066
If you're still here, I mean.

40:01.068 --> 40:04.171
You know, the problem is
that the river's polluted.

40:04.205 --> 40:05.740
The same everywhere, I guess.

40:05.773 --> 40:06.774
Everything's poison.

40:14.682 --> 40:17.450
My dad used to try and
clean it up whenever he could.

40:22.056 --> 40:23.124
When we'd go fishing.

40:28.495 --> 40:30.031
Is he the one who
taught you all this stuff?

40:31.265 --> 40:33.067
It seems like you know a lot
about living on your own.

40:37.104 --> 40:37.905
Yeah.

40:46.614 --> 40:47.815
I can get you
closer to Lake Lynne,

40:47.848 --> 40:48.849
but if you start
to change your mind

40:48.883 --> 40:49.750
I'm not bringing you back.

40:49.784 --> 40:51.218
That's fine.

40:51.252 --> 40:53.688
I don't know what I'm
getting caught up in.

41:00.795 --> 41:03.564
Are you sure you're not
running away from home?

41:10.104 --> 41:12.540
Hey, were you really gonna
hitchhike the whole way?

41:53.647 --> 41:54.248
What?

41:56.350 --> 41:57.551
Nothing.

43:02.116 --> 43:03.918
I wish you
could stay longer.

43:05.653 --> 43:07.321
In one week I'll be at school.

43:08.823 --> 43:10.958
They're letting me
help teach a class.

43:12.293 --> 43:13.360
Why aren't you in school?

43:15.930 --> 43:17.298
Guess I quit.

43:17.331 --> 43:19.700
You need to go
back and do that.

43:19.733 --> 43:23.237
My sister quit and school and
wishes she could go back now.

43:23.270 --> 43:25.339
You wanna clean houses
the rest of your life?

43:25.372 --> 43:27.675
That's about all she can do now.

43:27.708 --> 43:28.676
No, I guess not.

43:32.346 --> 43:34.248
Have you thought
about what you wanna be?

43:36.083 --> 43:38.752
Seems like you could do just
about anything you want.

45:20.354 --> 45:22.389
I have to leave in the morning.

45:22.423 --> 45:24.758
I know.

48:33.147 --> 48:34.948
Hey!

48:34.982 --> 48:35.617
I'm stuck!

48:47.428 --> 48:48.429
Are you okay?

48:48.462 --> 48:50.063
Yeah, I'm okay.

48:51.599 --> 48:55.969
I mean, except for the fact
that I'm dying of emphysema.

49:00.608 --> 49:01.543
What's your name?

49:02.476 --> 49:03.310
Smoke.

49:04.144 --> 49:05.412
Smoke, I'm Margo.

49:08.081 --> 49:08.716
Margo, huh?

49:12.186 --> 49:15.389
Well, know this, Margo,

49:18.192 --> 49:23.197
sometimes life is, it's
a lousy goddamn business.

49:31.573 --> 49:34.041
Oh, that's Fishbone's deer hyde.

49:34.074 --> 49:36.276
Who's Fishbone?

49:36.310 --> 49:38.613
Well, he's the man
that oughta be here

49:38.646 --> 49:40.214
by now with my smokes.

49:42.049 --> 49:46.588
Instead I get stuck and a
stranger comes by and saves me.

49:51.058 --> 49:55.530
Now, don't mind him, that's
just Nightmare saying hello.

49:56.497 --> 49:57.565
Well, come on.

50:05.673 --> 50:07.174
Can I buy that pot from you?

50:08.676 --> 50:09.511
Sure.

50:23.591 --> 50:26.794
Kid, you are filthy.

50:26.828 --> 50:29.129
Don't you ever take a bath?

50:29.162 --> 50:30.097
Well, I was camping.

50:31.799 --> 50:32.800
Camping alone?

50:35.102 --> 50:37.204
A girl your age should
be with her family.

50:42.342 --> 50:46.614
Well, I'm trying
to find my mom.

50:47.749 --> 50:49.049
And I had to hitchhike.

50:57.124 --> 51:01.829
If you want a shower, you
don't need to ask for it.

51:43.838 --> 51:44.772
You're
supposed to be hooked up

51:44.806 --> 51:45.740
to your oxygen all the time.

51:45.773 --> 51:47.207
You're not even using it.

51:47.240 --> 51:49.309
I use it when I
need it, Shelly.

51:49.343 --> 51:50.845
Don't bother about it.

51:50.878 --> 51:54.214
Kim, just leave me be, please.

51:55.415 --> 51:57.250
Do I bother you
about your lives?

51:58.920 --> 52:04.224
Come on,
it's time to go.

52:11.933 --> 52:13.367
Thanks for stopping by!

52:19.874 --> 52:21.174
It's been a real pleasure.

52:34.589 --> 52:35.723
This another niece?

52:39.661 --> 52:42.697
He sees me five days
a week, that thing.

52:42.730 --> 52:43.831
I don't care.

52:43.865 --> 52:45.767
You said you'd take care
of Nightmare when I'm dead,

52:45.800 --> 52:47.434
you better keep your promise.

52:47.467 --> 52:50.638
Oh, you ain't going
nowhere anytime soon.

52:50.672 --> 52:51.939
Ya grouch.

52:51.973 --> 52:54.307
Oh yeah, by the way,
here's your death sticks.

53:03.250 --> 53:05.586
I was hoping I could sleep
in your camper, Mr. Smoke.

53:09.256 --> 53:12.927
I don't need a kid sleeping
and hanging around here.

53:12.960 --> 53:15.697
But I'll clean
and cook, chop wood,

53:15.730 --> 53:17.230
meat, anything you want.

53:17.999 --> 53:19.667
I just need to save
up enough money

53:19.701 --> 53:21.334
to make my way further north.

53:27.041 --> 53:29.242
Ain't you supposed
to be in school?

53:29.276 --> 53:30.912
I saw your skins,
Mr. Fishbone.

53:31.779 --> 53:33.380
I could sell you skins.

53:34.816 --> 53:37.250
Pelts need to be perfect.

53:37.284 --> 53:38.920
I shoot 'em in the eye.

53:38.953 --> 53:40.722
Where'd you get
this girl, Smoke?

53:40.755 --> 53:42.890
Shooting critters in the eye.

53:44.324 --> 53:45.993
Real throw back here.

53:46.027 --> 53:47.394
Fishbone's a funny name.

53:47.427 --> 53:48.830
I like it.

53:48.863 --> 53:50.263
Smoke, too.

53:50.297 --> 53:51.298
Yeah, well, Terry here
don't know any better

53:51.331 --> 53:52.900
that Smoke's a black man's name.

53:53.868 --> 53:55.268
Go to hell.

53:55.302 --> 53:56.104
See, Smoke wish he
was black that way

53:56.137 --> 53:58.506
he'd have more to
complain about.

53:58.539 --> 54:00.440
Where's your mother?

54:00.474 --> 54:01.976
Lake Lynne, I think.

54:02.009 --> 54:05.012
Well, why can't you
just, you know, go to her?

54:05.046 --> 54:08.049
I'm not even sure I
have the right address.

54:08.082 --> 54:11.018
Please, it wouldn't be for long.

54:11.052 --> 54:12.687
Yeah, you should
take her in, Smoke.

54:12.720 --> 54:16.356
I don't like seeing a
girl out there all alone.

54:29.336 --> 54:30.905
All right.

54:30.938 --> 54:33.608
You don't need to
pay me for anything,

54:33.641 --> 54:35.475
you can shoot me in
the head instead.

54:36.711 --> 54:38.646
You know, if you
had been in the war,

54:39.514 --> 54:41.883
you wouldn't say such things.

54:41.916 --> 54:43.785
You're getting to
be a real church lady

54:43.818 --> 54:44.886
these days, ain't ya?

54:46.353 --> 54:49.690
Now, kid, when the time comes,

54:52.960 --> 54:56.030
you better live up to
your end of the bargain.

54:56.063 --> 54:58.398
Or send me away.

54:58.431 --> 54:59.834
I'm not gonna die in there.

55:01.669 --> 55:02.537
Right, kiddo?

55:06.140 --> 55:11.045
Can kiss me farewell then
blow my fucking head off.

56:40.835 --> 56:43.470
This property has had
a number of complaints

56:43.504 --> 56:45.106
and the county has sent letters.

56:46.240 --> 56:47.074
He knows.

56:49.243 --> 56:51.646
Okay, so what
do we need to do?

56:51.679 --> 56:53.714
This is your last warning.

56:53.748 --> 56:56.684
Clean up your act over
here or we will have to.

56:58.052 --> 56:59.987
All right, we'll
take care of it.

57:00.021 --> 57:01.488
Thank you.

57:01.522 --> 57:02.156
Sure.

57:03.490 --> 57:04.125
Let's go.

57:33.020 --> 57:36.857
You see the way people
can just strut in and

57:39.694 --> 57:43.230
take away your right to
live the way you want?

57:48.302 --> 57:49.236
Remember this.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.009
No more freedom in this country.

57:56.677 --> 57:58.179
Wish you'd keep your promise.

58:00.715 --> 58:03.217
I know you joke about
this, but I don't like it.

58:04.785 --> 58:05.720
I'm not joking.

58:11.192 --> 58:12.727
I've shot someone before.

58:19.033 --> 58:20.601
So what?

58:20.634 --> 58:22.103
You're turning yourself in?

58:28.275 --> 58:30.611
Probably a lousy son
of a bitch anyway.

58:32.079 --> 58:33.647
It doesn't matter.

58:33.681 --> 58:35.783
I still wish I never
did those things.

58:37.585 --> 58:39.653
Maybe my dad would
still be alive.

59:07.114 --> 59:08.182
I'm impressed.

59:09.183 --> 59:10.317
You got a shotgun?

59:11.652 --> 59:12.553
No, I used my rifle.

59:16.357 --> 59:18.659
Well, you're still
gonna need traps.

59:18.692 --> 59:19.927
Smoke got some he ain't using.

59:19.960 --> 59:21.595
Hey!

59:21.629 --> 59:24.331
Will you stop giving my shit
away while I'm still alive.

59:33.641 --> 59:36.010
Smoke told me to ask
you where a girl goes

59:36.043 --> 59:37.244
to get rid of a baby.

59:39.013 --> 59:39.947
What do you mean?

59:41.649 --> 59:42.716
Girl's pregnant.

59:44.652 --> 59:46.320
She doesn't want it.

59:49.356 --> 59:51.092
I don't like that
kinda business.

59:52.326 --> 59:53.894
I can't take care of a baby.

59:57.998 --> 59:58.833
Fishbone.

01:00:00.768 --> 01:00:03.604
I'm asking as a favor to me.

01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:05.973
Help her.

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:10.678
Or just take me to my mother.

01:00:12.146 --> 01:00:15.983
I have an address, I just
don't know if it's right.

01:00:18.119 --> 01:00:19.687
I think that's the idea.

01:01:25.152 --> 01:01:25.986
Here.

01:01:31.759 --> 01:01:32.459
You all right?

01:01:34.495 --> 01:01:37.298
I wonder if that's
what the ocean looks like.

01:01:38.766 --> 01:01:40.734
Well, you'll know
when you see the ocean.

01:01:43.137 --> 01:01:45.406
This is beautiful
country up here.

01:02:03.924 --> 01:02:06.427
Well, your ma's a rich lady.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.062
Wouldn't of guessed it from you.

01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:11.031
I wish I had my rifle.

01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:15.102
Not around here.

01:02:16.303 --> 01:02:19.106
No, rich folks get uneasy
about poor folks and firearms.

01:02:25.479 --> 01:02:26.880
Thank you for bringing me.

01:02:28.882 --> 01:02:29.817
Yeah, well...

01:03:06.153 --> 01:03:07.154
Who is it?

01:03:14.228 --> 01:03:14.862
Margaret Louise.

01:03:18.899 --> 01:03:20.134
Did you hear what happened?

01:03:24.371 --> 01:03:26.140
Yeah, no, come in.

01:03:26.173 --> 01:03:29.843
I, you just... you caught
me by surprise, that's all.

01:03:29.877 --> 01:03:30.512
Come in.

01:03:41.155 --> 01:03:42.956
Can I get you anything to drink?

01:03:46.594 --> 01:03:48.495
Isn't this an amazing view?

01:03:55.135 --> 01:03:55.969
I missed you.

01:03:57.304 --> 01:03:59.106
I'm so glad I had
the right address.

01:04:01.975 --> 01:04:03.277
Oh, Margaret.

01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:05.846
I really wanted to see you.

01:04:07.081 --> 01:04:08.516
I would've given anything,

01:04:09.651 --> 01:04:11.852
it just wasn't the
right time, you know?

01:04:13.153 --> 01:04:13.987
Why not?

01:04:15.422 --> 01:04:18.626
When I met Roger I told
him I didn't have any kids.

01:04:20.928 --> 01:04:23.464
Now, if I change my story
he'll think I'm a liar.

01:04:25.432 --> 01:04:26.601
But you are lying.

01:04:30.572 --> 01:04:33.974
Look, Roger is my fiance.

01:04:36.243 --> 01:04:38.546
He's a lot of fun, really.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.547
He's a great guy,

01:04:39.581 --> 01:04:41.982
it's just he's a little
opinionated, that's all.

01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:44.451
Your fiance.

01:04:45.986 --> 01:04:46.588
Yeah.

01:04:57.599 --> 01:05:00.467
Oh, Margaret, it really
is so good to see you.

01:05:02.436 --> 01:05:04.004
Come on, come sit with me.

01:05:20.254 --> 01:05:23.957
Roger's away until Friday,
I can run around how I like

01:05:23.991 --> 01:05:25.693
as long as I keep a low profile.

01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:32.032
So, what do you think?

01:05:37.037 --> 01:05:37.672
It's big.

01:05:40.073 --> 01:05:41.008
It's really nice.

01:05:43.477 --> 01:05:47.715
Yeah, Roger hates the
geese, but I don't mind 'em.

01:06:03.397 --> 01:06:04.732
How's Cal doing?

01:06:05.733 --> 01:06:06.967
He ever ask about me?

01:06:09.804 --> 01:06:11.038
I'm pregnant.

01:06:13.608 --> 01:06:14.441
What?

01:06:21.215 --> 01:06:23.751
Sweetie, how far along?

01:06:25.385 --> 01:06:26.220
Not too far.

01:06:29.389 --> 01:06:30.991
Who's the father?

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:33.060
His name's Will.

01:06:34.762 --> 01:06:36.598
He's a school teacher somewhere.

01:06:41.669 --> 01:06:45.005
Well, don't worry, I'm
gonna take care of you.

01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:48.610
I didn't when I should have,

01:06:48.643 --> 01:06:50.678
but I'm gonna take
care of you now.

01:06:54.782 --> 01:06:57.552
You know, I was about your age
when I was pregnant with you.

01:07:01.856 --> 01:07:03.457
I'm so sorry, Margaret.

01:07:06.226 --> 01:07:08.830
So, why don't you
rest up in here.

01:07:08.863 --> 01:07:11.633
You can take a shower,
there's a robe in here,

01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:16.069
and I'll call the clinic
before they close.

01:07:17.137 --> 01:07:18.171
Sound good?

01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:56.376
Watch and listen.

01:08:09.557 --> 01:08:11.124
Some day I'll take
you to the ocean

01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:15.730
and taste the difference between
saltwater fish and these.

01:08:36.283 --> 01:08:38.118
No, honey, no one...

01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:41.121
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:44.191
Okay.

01:08:44.224 --> 01:08:45.560
I love you, too.

01:08:45.593 --> 01:08:46.426
Bye.

01:08:48.529 --> 01:08:49.930
Hey, there, sleeping beauty.

01:08:49.964 --> 01:08:52.499
You were out cold
for four hours.

01:08:52.533 --> 01:08:53.600
I got Chinese food.

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:55.502
You want some wine?

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:02.877
I usually try not to
drink during the week

01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:06.313
but today's turning out to
be quite the surprising day.

01:09:18.325 --> 01:09:19.359
Why'd you leave?

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.434
Listen...

01:09:30.337 --> 01:09:35.341
Leaving you was the hardest
thing I've ever had to do,

01:09:42.015 --> 01:09:45.218
but I would have died
or drank myself to death

01:09:45.252 --> 01:09:46.353
if I would've stayed.

01:09:53.861 --> 01:09:55.228
I really did try.

01:09:59.266 --> 01:10:01.334
I thought you
left because of me.

01:10:02.402 --> 01:10:03.437
No.

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:05.573
I know, I know it seems selfish,

01:10:09.043 --> 01:10:11.278
but I had to find
happiness somehow.

01:10:13.047 --> 01:10:14.448
I was miserable.

01:10:19.286 --> 01:10:20.253
Do you hate me, Margo?

01:10:26.828 --> 01:10:27.461
No.

01:10:30.998 --> 01:10:32.667
You should live how you want.

01:11:27.054 --> 01:11:29.356
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:11:30.057 --> 01:11:31.058
You're so pretty.

01:11:33.628 --> 01:11:36.496
Well, I can show you
how to do all this.

01:11:37.865 --> 01:11:40.433
That's something I can
help you with, at least.

01:11:42.003 --> 01:11:42.904
Okay.

01:11:43.905 --> 01:11:45.072
Well, you ready?

01:11:52.613 --> 01:11:54.314
Do you wish you hadn't had me?

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.518
Of course I'm
glad that I had you.

01:12:00.655 --> 01:12:02.422
But I had a husband to help me.

01:12:07.394 --> 01:12:10.131
You're all alone, sweetie.

01:12:10.164 --> 01:12:11.532
I'm not completely alone.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.501
Do you wanna have this baby?

01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:22.375
Okay, then.

01:12:30.051 --> 01:12:32.119
Save yourself.

01:12:32.153 --> 01:12:34.421
Oh, go to hell, you freaks.

01:12:34.454 --> 01:12:36.090
I'll run your asses over.

01:12:37.191 --> 01:12:38.860
I got mace!

01:12:43.496 --> 01:12:45.365
You're making the
right decision.

01:12:47.168 --> 01:12:49.871
I'm gonna go to the bank and
I'll be right back, okay?

01:12:55.042 --> 01:12:56.376
Is this your first visit?

01:12:58.713 --> 01:13:00.548
Okay, here you go.

01:13:00.581 --> 01:13:01.749
Just fill this out.

01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:05.086
Someone will come
get you shortly.

01:13:34.682 --> 01:13:36.584
You can come with me.

01:13:47.595 --> 01:13:52.166
Undress and put this gown
on, let it open in the back.

01:13:52.199 --> 01:13:54.135
It'll just be a
couple minutes now.

01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:05.866
This is not normal.

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:08.235
You're gonna raise a baby? Here?

01:16:10.337 --> 01:16:13.574
Why do you care so
much about normal?

01:16:17.378 --> 01:16:20.214
I never had any kids, but
I could help that girl

01:16:22.917 --> 01:16:24.318
live how she wants.

01:16:24.351 --> 01:16:27.755
She is going to have a
baby, it's not just about her.

01:16:27.788 --> 01:16:30.357
Will you stop talking
like I'm not evne here?

01:16:31.659 --> 01:16:32.927
We will be okay.

01:16:34.128 --> 01:16:36.664
Plenty of people are
worse off than this.

01:16:36.697 --> 01:16:37.331
I'm fine.

01:16:40.734 --> 01:16:43.270
Something does not
smell right in here.

01:16:49.043 --> 01:16:49.877
It's you.

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.648
You feeling okay?

01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:56.784
I'm fine.

01:17:01.689 --> 01:17:03.090
You need to take a bath.

01:17:04.992 --> 01:17:08.662
I would stay, but I have a
house full of family and guests.

01:17:19.974 --> 01:17:22.243
Why won't you let your health
aide come and help you bathe

01:17:22.276 --> 01:17:23.644
like she's supposed to?

01:17:24.812 --> 01:17:28.149
My body is none of
them bitch's business.

01:17:31.085 --> 01:17:35.856
However, it has been a couple
of weeks since I've bathed.

01:17:41.028 --> 01:17:41.929
Let me help you.

01:17:44.198 --> 01:17:46.867
You need to be look for
your nieces tomorrow, right?

01:17:56.210 --> 01:17:58.412
I don't
want the lights on.

01:17:58.445 --> 01:17:59.880
Okay.

01:18:15.196 --> 01:18:19.133
Why does Fishbone
look after you?

01:18:19.166 --> 01:18:20.901
Why do you help me, kid?

01:18:20.935 --> 01:18:22.469
Why does anybody help anybody?

01:18:23.837 --> 01:18:25.739
We were in a band
together for years.

01:18:28.108 --> 01:18:29.210
You ever play still?

01:18:31.478 --> 01:18:33.347
No, not so much.

01:18:41.322 --> 01:18:43.157
I'd love to hear
you play sometime.

01:18:46.193 --> 01:18:47.361
You're a good girl.

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:52.866
Even your crazy mama
always knew that.

01:19:10.552 --> 01:19:12.319
How many cards?

01:19:12.353 --> 01:19:14.888
What do you need, what
do you want? How many?

01:19:14.922 --> 01:19:16.056
- Two.
- Two?

01:19:20.861 --> 01:19:22.196
Oh, less than two weeks.

01:19:27.901 --> 01:19:32.306
This could be our last
supper before prison.

01:19:34.241 --> 01:19:36.977
This place is... and they
know what they're doing,

01:19:38.212 --> 01:19:39.246
and you'll have help.

01:19:40.582 --> 01:19:42.249
They're doing it out of love.

01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:46.186
Oh, save me from
their fucking love.

01:19:47.221 --> 01:19:48.523
I like being alone.

01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:52.793
Well...

01:19:56.864 --> 01:19:57.931
I'll see you soon.

01:20:01.168 --> 01:20:02.002
Huh?

01:20:17.017 --> 01:20:17.851
Margo.

01:20:27.394 --> 01:20:28.896
What's this?

01:20:33.635 --> 01:20:36.638
No, you've already
given me enough.

01:20:36.671 --> 01:20:38.573
I should give you
my shotgun, too.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.208
Only, use it on me first.

01:20:42.443 --> 01:20:43.977
You need to stop saying that.

01:20:45.212 --> 01:20:47.481
I deserve to die
with some dignity.

01:20:47.515 --> 01:20:49.416
But I'll come visit
you all the time.

01:20:50.618 --> 01:20:53.487
I mean, you're my best friend.

01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:58.859
Then you better
make some friends.

01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:03.397
Margo, listen.

01:21:11.105 --> 01:21:16.076
I don't know if I'd of made it

01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:18.112
these last couple of
months without you.

You missed it.

01:22:45.466 --> 01:22:46.467
A beautiful sunrise.

01:22:50.337 --> 01:22:52.139
Pink sky over a storm.

01:22:57.545 --> 01:22:58.513
My favorite.

01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:11.124
Go get my jacket and smokes.

01:23:15.763 --> 01:23:17.565
I'll be right here.

01:23:47.127 --> 01:23:48.161
Smoke!

01:23:53.835 --> 01:23:55.369
Smoke!

01:23:59.507 --> 01:24:00.307
No.

01:24:12.152 --> 01:24:13.186
Please.

01:24:16.624 --> 01:24:17.457
Smoke!

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:27.835
Smoke!

01:24:30.838 --> 01:24:35.843
Don't leave me.

01:25:22.523 --> 01:25:23.825
I have some skins for you.

01:25:47.582 --> 01:25:49.249
You didn't come
to the funeral.

01:25:53.888 --> 01:25:56.189
They asked if I thought
it was a suicide.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.928
As it was a favorite
topic of conversation,

01:26:00.962 --> 01:26:02.630
they ruled it as such.

01:26:11.639 --> 01:26:15.576
You know, he called me
that morning all wheezy.

01:26:16.611 --> 01:26:17.679
Scared my wife.

01:26:21.481 --> 01:26:23.450
I wonder what he
wanted to tell me now.

01:26:24.819 --> 01:26:25.920
I have a good guess.

01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:38.465
Hey, you know you
need to have that baby

01:26:38.498 --> 01:26:39.767
at the hospital, right?

01:26:41.301 --> 01:26:44.237
Baby needs shots
and a certificate.

01:26:44.271 --> 01:26:44.972
I'll take you.

01:26:46.974 --> 01:26:47.975
You don't have to.

01:26:48.976 --> 01:26:51.913
Well, maybe I have a
soft spot for a baby.

01:26:54.682 --> 01:26:55.550
Is that okay?

01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:11.298
You can go to
the river to remember,

01:27:12.365 --> 01:27:14.267
and you can go to
the river to forget.

01:27:16.037 --> 01:27:20.041
Spring is here and I
wanna tell you my story

01:27:20.074 --> 01:27:21.441
because it's yours, too.

01:27:24.512 --> 01:27:26.013
I welcome you to the river.
