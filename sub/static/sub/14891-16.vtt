Cousin, there’s something
I think you should know.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.254
Balki, if you’re gonna tell me

01:28.288 --> 01:30.857
that the toaster’s broken,
don’t bother.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.826
The toaster’s broken?

01:32.859 --> 01:35.328
No wonder why my Pop‐Tart
never popped up.

01:41.301 --> 01:44.370
U‐um, I’ve also
got a, a fork in there. Yes.

01:46.372 --> 01:49.610
Um, the thing that I wanted
to tell you is...

01:49.643 --> 01:53.146
Look, uh, Jennifer is knitting
something for you

01:53.179 --> 01:56.449
and, um, ordinarily I would
never want to spoil the surprise

01:56.482 --> 01:57.851
but I think if you
just take a look‐‐

01:57.884 --> 01:59.352
Okay. It’s okay, Balki,
it’s okay.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.321
She’s probably
knitting me a sweater.

02:01.354 --> 02:03.189
She’s always
knitting me sweaters.

02:03.223 --> 02:05.325
Except for the time
she knitted me a car cover.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.630
Cousin, she’s,
she’s not knitting you

02:09.663 --> 02:11.497
a car cover or a sweater.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.133
She’s knitting you these.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.372
And, and usually I, I wouldn’t

02:19.405 --> 02:20.874
even dream of spoiling
the surprise

02:20.907 --> 02:22.843
but I just wanted you
to see them.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.350
I, I wanted you to see them so
that when she gives them to you

02:30.383 --> 02:34.655
and you see that they’re
...way too small, you...

02:38.491 --> 02:39.760
...you, you won’t say...

02:39.793 --> 02:41.662
‐"Oh, my Lord!"
‐"Oh, my Lord!"

02:41.695 --> 02:44.264
...and hurt her feelings.

02:44.297 --> 02:46.900
Balki, d‐do you have
any idea what this means?

02:46.933 --> 02:49.703
Well, of course I do.
Don’t be ridiculous.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.441
It means Jennifer has grossly
misjudged your foot size.

02:58.745 --> 03:03.216
I think they’ll stretch if we
just...dip them in something.

03:03.249 --> 03:05.251
Some kind of saline solution
or something.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.954
No, Balki, d‐don’t you get it?

03:09.956 --> 03:11.892
Jennifer’s gonna have a ba‐aa...

03:13.493 --> 03:15.228
Jennifer’s gonna have a ba‐aa...

03:16.663 --> 03:18.398
Jennifer is going
to have a sheep?

03:22.536 --> 03:27.340
In the entire history of Mypos,
that only happened once.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.514
No, Balki, Jennifer
is not gonna have a sheep.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.016
She’s gonna have a...baby.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.651
A baby what?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.688
A baby Appleton.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.590
Cousin! Cousin!

03:43.624 --> 03:44.725
Oh, my goodness.

03:44.758 --> 03:45.859
When did Jennifer tell you?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.761
W‐well, she hasn’t
told me y‐yet.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.796
She, she obviously wants it
to be a surprise.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.331
That’s why
she’s knitting booties.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.968
That’s why
she’s knitting booties?

03:55.001 --> 03:57.804
It’s what women do
to prepare for a baby.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.608
Well, that’s,
that’s kind of odd.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.012
On Mypos, when a woman
is expecting a child

04:06.046 --> 04:09.616
all she has to do
is dig a deeper well

04:09.650 --> 04:13.419
buy a bigger laundry basket
and pre‐chew a lot of meat.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.559
They’re blue.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.560
That, that means it’s a boy.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.795
Well, I, I can handle that.

04:21.827 --> 04:24.397
I, I used to be a little boy.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.866
I‐I’ll just do everything
my father did.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.467
I‐I’ll, I’ll be my son’s pal.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.735
We‐we’ll communicate.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.538
If he does something wrong,
I’ll just point it out to him.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.306
And, and when, when he builds
that, that little car

04:33.339 --> 04:35.375
for, for the Soap Box Derby

04:35.408 --> 04:37.277
I’ll just tell him
that it’s not good enough.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.081
And I’ll be sure to tell him
in front of all his friends.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.050
Oh, Balki, who am I kidding?

04:44.084 --> 04:45.952
I’m gonna destroy my son.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.020
Cousin, cousin, cousin, come on.

04:47.053 --> 04:50.023
I think you’re overestimating
your influence.

04:50.056 --> 04:51.057
Now...

04:54.360 --> 04:55.796
...you’ll learn
how to be a father.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.364
Look, uh, in the beginning
anyway all you have to do

04:58.398 --> 05:01.367
is just let him be a baby,
have fun, eat with his hands.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.605
That’s just like you.

05:04.638 --> 05:08.441
Everything is fun and games
and enjoying life.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.545
Well, that’s
just not how it works.

05:11.578 --> 05:12.679
And someday you’ll have
a son of your own

05:12.713 --> 05:14.648
and you’ll see
just how hard it is.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.118
Maybe I will have a son.

05:18.151 --> 05:22.355
Cousin, I’ll teach him
everything my father taught me.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.324
I’ll teach him
how to shear a sheep.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.393
I’ll teach him
how to milk a goat.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.897
I’ll teach him
how to outrun lava.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.972
Cousin, wouldn’t it be great
if, if our little boys

05:39.005 --> 05:41.107

After your nap,
we’ll take you to Disneyland.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.675
Now, why would you
promise them that?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.743
We have no intention
of taking them to Disneyland.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.645
I know, I’m just hoping
you’ll take me.

That’s a skill I can use.

What can you learn
going to Disneyland?

06:48.542 --> 06:50.611
That it’s,
it’s a small world after all?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.116
And how to have fun?

that’s just your problem.

is, is about fun and games.

his collar bell will ring

and then our dads will know
that we’re not taking a nap

08:09.890 --> 08:11.825
and we’ll be
sent to an orphanage.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.695

to eat crumbs

14:04.377 --> 14:06.613
‐Don’t worry. I have...
‐Oh, God.

14:06.647 --> 14:08.081
...a plan.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.851
[instrumental music]

14:22.663 --> 14:25.198
Okay, Balki.

14:25.231 --> 14:26.933
You hold the blocks steady

14:26.967 --> 14:28.268
and I’ll climb up
to the window sill.

14:35.609 --> 14:37.177
Hello, Mr. Bear.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.582
Do you want, do you, do you want
to play in the backyard?

14:43.349 --> 14:47.453
Balki? Are, are you holding
the blocks st‐steady?

14:47.487 --> 14:49.656
Just a minute, cousin,
I’m talking to Mr. Bear.

14:49.690 --> 14:52.092
You‐you’re what?
You’re talking to Mr. Bear?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.126
Oh!

14:58.098 --> 14:59.533
’Nose, nose.’

15:01.668 --> 15:03.937
Eyes, eyes.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.206
Mouth, mouth.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.976
Ear, ear.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.315
‐What did I ask you to do?
‐Hold the blocks.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.650
‐What did you do?
‐Talked to Mr. Bear.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.184
What happened?

15:18.218 --> 15:19.953
Cousin Larry fall down, go boom.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.323
What should you say to me?

15:24.691 --> 15:26.292
Do it again.

15:27.493 --> 15:28.662
[instrumental music]

15:28.695 --> 15:30.496
Oh. Oh...

15:30.531 --> 15:31.632
Oh.

15:41.742 --> 15:43.476
[screaming]

15:44.611 --> 15:46.346
[gasps]

15:49.249 --> 15:51.451
You know, I just never
get used to that thing!

15:54.420 --> 15:56.657
Will you concentrate
for a minute?

15:56.690 --> 15:59.192
We have to find
a way out the window.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.393
Let’s play patty cake.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.028
No, I don’t want to play
"Patty Cake."

16:02.062 --> 16:03.263
Well, I can’t say I blame you.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.598
I mean, "Patty Cake."

16:04.631 --> 16:05.732
What is that anyway?

16:07.233 --> 16:10.203
And, and who is this
"Baker’s man?"

16:10.236 --> 16:12.706
And why does he have to make me
a cake as fast as he can?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.474
Where’s the quality in that?

16:16.309 --> 16:18.178
‐And when he‐‐
‐The seesaw.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.279
Perfect!

16:20.413 --> 16:23.316
Oh, cousin...

16:23.349 --> 16:25.719
Oh, I always wanted to play
on the seesaw.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.487
How, how does it work?

16:34.227 --> 16:35.328
All the fun’s on your side.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.364
Stand up.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.042
‐I don’t see‐‐
‐No, don’t, don’t, don’t!

16:49.075 --> 16:50.076
Oh!

16:52.178 --> 16:53.547
[crying]

16:54.480 --> 16:55.481
Mmm.

16:58.318 --> 17:01.722
We are not going to play
on the seesaw.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.189
You are gonna sit on that end

17:03.223 --> 17:04.691
I am gonna climb up
on the blocks

17:04.724 --> 17:06.593
and jump on the high end,
you’ll sail through the air

17:06.627 --> 17:08.361
land on the window sill
and you can climb out.

17:10.664 --> 17:11.765
Uh‐oh.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.669
You don’t like the plan.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.671
No, I, I didn’t say that.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.773
I see it all over your face.
You don’t like the plan.

17:20.807 --> 17:24.210
Well, it’s, it’s just that
I, I’m still recovering

17:24.243 --> 17:25.512
from that jack‐in‐the‐box thing.

17:25.546 --> 17:28.080
I mean...look at that thing.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.415
It’s hideous!

17:30.751 --> 17:33.219
A‐a disembodied head
and a pair of arms

17:33.253 --> 17:34.688
and, uh,
just a spring for a body?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.456
How does it digest its food?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.425
And then, then this.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.127
I, I don’t know...
Flying through the air?

17:41.161 --> 17:43.129
I, I might have done that

17:43.163 --> 17:45.498
before but now that
I know I have two thumbs

17:45.532 --> 17:47.467
I’ve got too much to live for.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.771
Alright. Alright.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.105
We’ll just have
to think of something else.

17:54.608 --> 17:57.611
I know! We can take the crib
and push it over to the window

17:57.644 --> 17:59.345
and climb up on that.

17:59.379 --> 18:03.116
Naw, that’ll never work.
I’ve got it!

18:03.149 --> 18:04.551
We can take the crib, push it

18:04.585 --> 18:06.520
over to the window
and we can climb up on that.

18:08.922 --> 18:09.823
You know, when you say it

18:09.856 --> 18:11.592
it don’t sound like
such a good idea.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.462
Oh, really? Oh, really...
Let me ask you something.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.731
How many nurseries
have you escaped from?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.666
‐Oh, come on!
‐Hmm? How many? How many?

18:19.700 --> 18:20.601
‐How many nurseries...
‐Cousin, cousin, cousin‐‐

18:20.634 --> 18:24.671
How many nurseries
have you escaped from?

18:24.705 --> 18:27.273
You know, this argument
is a lot like diaper rash.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.478
I’ve had it before and I know
I’m gonna have it again.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.617
Come on, just pull on the crib.

18:36.650 --> 18:38.384
[instrumental music]

18:42.188 --> 18:43.690
Here we go. On three.

18:43.724 --> 18:45.726
Ready? One, two, three.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.797
[grunts]
Alright, one more time.
On three. Here we go.

18:50.831 --> 18:52.866
Ready? One, two, three.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.636
[grunting]

18:57.270 --> 18:58.939
Alright, here we go.
One more time, on three.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.907
Ready? One, two, three.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.781
Pull!

19:07.814 --> 19:08.815
Ow!

19:10.917 --> 19:12.853
[crying]

19:20.661 --> 19:22.328
Cousin, you know,
I was thinking‐‐

19:22.362 --> 19:23.664
‐No, I do the thinking.
‐Cousin, if... Cousin...

19:23.697 --> 19:24.798
I do the thinking.

19:24.831 --> 19:28.669
I, I, I. Me! Me! Me!

19:33.339 --> 19:34.741
You know, it’s babies like you

19:34.775 --> 19:36.810
that give us two‐year‐olds
a bad name.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.847
Alright, one more time,
on three.

19:40.881 --> 19:42.583
This time we push.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.951
Ready? One, two, three...

19:44.985 --> 19:46.720
[grunts]

19:48.622 --> 19:51.592
You know, Balki,
we’re lucky to have such quiet

19:51.625 --> 19:52.926
well‐behaved children.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.561
Yeah, right.

19:54.595 --> 19:55.896
Are you sure we can’t go
to Disneyland?

19:55.929 --> 19:56.930
‐No.
‐Oh.

19:57.798 --> 19:59.533
[crashing sound]

20:08.374 --> 20:09.743
‐Hi.
‐Hi.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.182
Oh, God.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.885
Balki, our, our children are
gonna be jus‐just like us.

20:18.919 --> 20:21.287
I, I, I’m not ready
to have a child.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.826
I, I couldn’t even take
care of my pet goldfish.

20:25.859 --> 20:27.594
I, I overfed him and he died.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.832
Winston’s dead?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.001
You told me
he went to a petting zoo.

20:39.873 --> 20:41.241
Hi, guys.

20:42.643 --> 20:45.579
Larry, I have some
very exciting news.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.613
[gasping]

20:49.315 --> 20:51.417
Don’t worry, Jennifer,
Cousin Larry will be okay

20:51.451 --> 20:53.620
once the baby arrives.

20:53.654 --> 20:56.790
Baby? How did Larry know my
Cousin Lucille is having a baby?

20:56.823 --> 20:58.992
Your Cousin Lucille
is having a baby?

21:00.493 --> 21:02.062
Yes, Larry,
she’s due in the spring.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.864
You’re not having a baby?

21:03.897 --> 21:04.998
No. No!

21:05.031 --> 21:08.368
Larry, if I were you’d
be the second one to know.

21:12.773 --> 21:14.508
Wonder who she’s planning
on telling first?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.778
[instrumental music]

21:28.454 --> 21:30.624
Larry, are you disappointed

21:30.657 --> 21:32.526
the baby is my cousin’s
and not ours?

21:33.694 --> 21:35.529
Oh, no, no. Not at all.

21:37.731 --> 21:40.667
Well, well,
maybe a‐a‐a little.

21:42.035 --> 21:44.671
You know, b‐but,
Jen, I promise...

21:44.705 --> 21:47.741
When the time comes,
I’m gonna learn

21:47.774 --> 21:49.710
everything there is to know
about fatherhood.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.614
Oh, Larry, you’ll make
a wonderful father.

22:02.823 --> 22:05.526
But aren’t you forgetting
one very important step

22:05.559 --> 22:07.694
towards becoming a father?

22:17.904 --> 22:19.573
Oh! Oh!

22:19.606 --> 22:21.608
Oh, oh! Ooh! Oh!

22:21.642 --> 22:23.510
Mmm, mm‐mmm.

22:23.544 --> 22:24.678
Oh, oh.

22:24.711 --> 22:25.812
[glass shattering]

22:25.846 --> 22:28.782
[theme music]

22:56.042 --> 22:58.779
