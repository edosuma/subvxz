Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...
Let's delve into your childhood.

00:03.771 --> 00:05.573
I've been through
the therapy wringer.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.075
I've rehashed
my childhood a ton.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.210
I don't really want
to do it again.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.645
I love him so much.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.147
I know, sweetie.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.316
You did what?

00:15.349 --> 00:17.451
You kissed her?!

00:17.485 --> 00:18.819
I-I feel terrible.
 You feel terrible?

00:18.852 --> 00:19.687
I got caught up
in the moment in court!

00:19.720 --> 00:22.190
I-I don't know
what happened. I'm sorry.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.824
Do you love her?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.226
No.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.261
God, no.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.398
(applause)

00:30.431 --> 00:31.732
REBECCA:
 Why doesn't anyone love me?

00:31.765 --> 00:32.866
He doesn't love me.
 I hate my life.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.169
Why doesn't anyone love me?
 He doesn't love me.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.776
We're stuck together
for the next five hours.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.112
You want to
give it a go?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.546
Do some therapy?

00:45.579 --> 00:46.580
Okay.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.484
Yeah, let's do this.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.487
(door opens)

00:53.521 --> 00:55.489
Okay, don't scratch
the walls, please.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.626
Or the floors or...
you know, anything.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.161
Watch out for
the ceramic horse.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.296
It goes right there.
Put it right there.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.531
It's my best friend's
couch, she lives here.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.533
I mean, she had
to sell the couch,

01:05.566 --> 01:07.201
but I got it back for her.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.636
Cost me 80 bucks.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.139
I'm telling you, it was
worth every penny,

01:11.172 --> 01:14.275
because she is
my best friend.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.776
Yeah, we know everything
about each other.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.279
I mean, I'd tell you
where she is right now,

01:18.312 --> 01:21.515
but, eh, it's kind of
a big secret, so...

01:21.549 --> 01:22.516
I'm kidding!

01:22.550 --> 01:23.851
She's in Hawaii with

01:23.884 --> 01:26.154
her ex-soon-to-be-
current-boyfriend,

01:26.187 --> 01:27.188
Joshua Felix Chan.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.223
(speaking Spanish)

01:30.624 --> 01:32.660
WOMAN:
 Welcome aboard Flight 72,

01:32.693 --> 01:34.562
with nonstop service
 to New York's

01:34.595 --> 01:37.831
JFK International Airport.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.301
So let's start by talking
about where you're going.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.303
Mmm... you mean, in life?

01:42.336 --> 01:45.273
No. I mean, why you're
going to New York.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.208
Oh, got it, yeah.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.176
We're on a plane.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.511
Well, I was gonna
go to Hawaii...
Mm-hmm.

01:50.544 --> 01:53.247
...with a friend--

01:53.281 --> 01:54.248
kind of--

01:54.282 --> 01:56.717
but then I realized

01:56.750 --> 01:59.187
that my life
in Southern California

01:59.220 --> 02:01.489
is nothing but a pile
of garbage and turds.

02:01.522 --> 02:02.756
So I e-mailed my old boss

02:02.790 --> 02:04.425
to see if I could come back

02:04.458 --> 02:06.227
to my old firm in New York,

02:06.260 --> 02:09.229
and she said they'd welcome me
back with open arms.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.231
Another move.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.265
That's a big decision.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.266
Oh, yeah.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.602
I'm great at those.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.170
Rebecca, you and I
never even had time

02:16.204 --> 02:17.338
to cover the fundamentals.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.406
I never got
a chance to ask you

02:18.439 --> 02:20.674
what brought you to West
Covina in the first place?

02:20.708 --> 02:22.776
(sighs)

02:22.810 --> 02:25.613
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

02:25.646 --> 02:27.448
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

02:27.481 --> 02:29.317
* One day I was crying a lot

02:29.350 --> 02:30.451
* And so I decided to move

02:30.484 --> 02:32.286
* To West Covina, California

02:32.320 --> 02:33.221
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

02:33.254 --> 02:35.589
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

02:35.623 --> 02:38.259
* But that's not why I'm here

02:38.292 --> 02:40.361
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.263
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

02:42.296 --> 02:43.264
That's a sexist term.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.698
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

02:44.732 --> 02:45.899
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.536
* She's so broken inside *

02:48.569 --> 02:50.204
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.240
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

02:52.273 --> 02:53.441
Okay! We get it!

02:53.474 --> 02:55.376
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

02:55.409 --> 02:57.978
So you did move to
West Covina for Josh?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.414
Oh, yeah. 100%.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.716
I should update that story.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.452
And when you got to town,

03:04.485 --> 03:06.520
didn't anyone see through
your excuses right away?

03:06.554 --> 03:08.289
Nope. You'd be surprised.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.490
You lie to yourself well enough,

03:09.523 --> 03:11.392
you can convince
other people, too.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.364
Ugh, what is this stain?

03:16.397 --> 03:18.399
Oh, man, if she sits on that,
she might have triplets.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.303
Good call.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.340
Ah, so...

03:26.374 --> 03:28.376
I guess we should
go back to work.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.012
(whispers):
Oh, wow.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.981
It is so quiet.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.551
I may just read a damn magazine

03:37.585 --> 03:39.420
like a real person.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.621
(smacks lips)

03:40.654 --> 03:44.224
Does anybody in this house
need or want anything from me?

03:45.393 --> 03:46.627
No?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.396
Oh, my God...

03:48.429 --> 03:49.830
(laughing):
Oh, I love it here.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.465
So much... oh.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.666
What? Oh, you want
to go back to work?

03:52.700 --> 03:54.368
Yeah, okay, go 'head.

03:54.402 --> 03:57.438
Mommy's gonna have herself
a little staycation.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.307
What? Just tell Darryl
I'm not feeling well.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.741
Don't worry, it's fine.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.310
Oh, believe me,

04:02.343 --> 04:03.311
Rebecca is not gonna care.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.478
She's in Hawaii!

04:04.512 --> 04:05.813
She doesn't care
about anything right now.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.748
REBECCA:
 Anyway...

04:07.781 --> 04:10.318
things did not work out

04:10.351 --> 04:12.320
between me and Josh.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.854
Hmm.
Yeah.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.589
Love doesn't work out
for me, ever.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.459
Rebecca, I'm sure
that's not true.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.927
Oh, my God,
it's absolutely true.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.330
Love does not last in my life.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.864
I always end up alone.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.434
My life... is loveless.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.969
"Loveless." That's the word
to describe my life.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.405
I'm horrible at love,
any sort of love--

04:31.439 --> 04:33.407
relationships, family, pets.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.476
I ruin everything.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.711
Can I remind you
of something?

04:37.745 --> 04:40.881
You said the very same thing
when Josh found out

04:40.914 --> 04:42.683
about the broken window
in your apartment.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.518
And the next
day at Boba,

04:44.552 --> 04:45.953
Paula told you

04:45.986 --> 04:47.588
that you weren't
a ruiner, not at all,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.022
that you were
a put-togetherer

04:49.056 --> 04:51.325
and that you helped her
save her marriage.

04:51.359 --> 04:54.828
That's... all true,
but how did you know that?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.530
I've only had
one session with you,

04:56.564 --> 04:57.698
and it was months ago.

04:59.032 --> 04:59.333
Whoa!

04:59.367 --> 05:01.435
Thank you.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.972
Are you a ghost?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.375
Wait, you're not a ghost.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.877
I'm sitting next to you
on this plane... aren't I?

05:09.910 --> 05:10.911
Nope.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.446
You're asleep,
my friend.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.814
(steward bell chimes)

05:13.847 --> 05:15.115
(snorts)

05:15.148 --> 05:17.351
(baby crying)

05:18.752 --> 05:20.421
Oh, right!

05:20.454 --> 05:21.822
I sat down next to you.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.357
You said, "Well, we're
gonna be stuck together

05:23.391 --> 05:24.157
"for the next five hours.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.526
Might as well do
a therapy session."

05:25.559 --> 05:26.494
I said, "Cool,"
but then I downed

05:26.527 --> 05:28.862
a couple sleeping pills
with a Bloody Mary.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.063
I'm sorry.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.701
Wait... am I dead?

05:33.734 --> 05:34.702
Because aren't you dead?

05:34.735 --> 05:35.903
Isn't that what a ghost is?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.539
There are such things
as dream ghosts.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.540
A dream ghost!

05:39.573 --> 05:40.541
Well, that sounds fun.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.809
Oh, can we do fun things?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.076
There's a ton of stuff
I want to do.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.646
One: I want to haunt Hitler and
get him to rethink a few things.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.781
Two: I want to see what
Oprah does in her bathtub.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.883
And three: I want to go
to the nearest planet

05:49.917 --> 05:51.919
with intelligent life
and see a play.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.921
That's not what
dream ghosts do.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.556
Oh... no, really?

05:55.589 --> 05:56.424
Listen up, honey.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.058
(Motown music begins)
You obviously

05:58.091 --> 05:59.593
don't understand why I'm here.

05:59.627 --> 06:00.994
So allow me
to break it down for you.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.733
* You know the trope

06:06.734 --> 06:09.570
* In storytelling it's a norm

06:10.571 --> 06:12.506
* When a person's in trouble

06:12.540 --> 06:14.408
* A manifestation

06:14.442 --> 06:17.445
* Of their subconscious appears
in the form of a *

06:17.478 --> 06:19.580
* Dream ghost

06:21.482 --> 06:23.917
* Giving advice
you kind of already knew *

06:23.951 --> 06:26.086
* I'm a dream ghost

06:28.155 --> 06:31.391
* I'm really just your mind
working things through *

06:31.959 --> 06:33.461
* It's not clear

06:33.494 --> 06:35.162
* If I'm hallucinated

06:35.195 --> 06:38.432
* Or actually magic

06:38.466 --> 06:40.768
* Let's leave it vague

06:40.801 --> 06:43.036
* It's more interesting
that way *

06:46.540 --> 06:48.509
* I'm going to take you

06:48.542 --> 06:52.045
* On a journey
through time and space *

06:52.079 --> 06:54.548
* And in the end
you'll realize *

06:54.582 --> 06:55.949
* You knew the answer
all along *

06:55.983 --> 06:57.785
* Honestly

06:57.818 --> 06:59.787
* It's a bit of a waste
to be a *

06:59.820 --> 07:01.489
* Dream ghost

07:01.522 --> 07:03.123
* Dream ghost *

07:03.156 --> 07:07.027
* We're other dream ghosts
helping people on this plane *

07:07.060 --> 07:08.496
* We're also dream ghosts

07:08.529 --> 07:11.031
* Dream ghosts *

07:11.064 --> 07:12.199
* While you're all asleep

07:12.232 --> 07:13.667
* We'll sing the refrain

07:13.701 --> 07:15.803
* It'll never be clear

07:15.836 --> 07:17.505
* If we're hallucinated

07:17.538 --> 07:20.207
* Or actually magic

07:20.240 --> 07:22.510
* And we're all women

07:22.543 --> 07:25.546
* 'Cause this job
doesn't pay so well *

07:25.579 --> 07:27.981
Wow, so there are
a lot of dream ghosts.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.217
Yep. A lot of people on this
plane are having predicaments.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.820
* This guy is deciding

07:32.853 --> 07:36.156
* Whether or not
to leave his wife *

07:37.658 --> 07:40.127
* This girl is wondering

07:40.160 --> 07:43.731
* If she should
terminate a pregnancy *

07:45.098 --> 07:47.234
* This lady's dreaming
in Portuguese *

07:47.267 --> 07:50.871
* So I'm not sure
what she wants *

07:51.772 --> 07:54.575
* And this douche is agonizing

07:54.608 --> 07:56.877
* Over whether to buy
or lease a new Porsche *

07:58.612 --> 08:01.749
* We are the dream ghosts

08:01.782 --> 08:03.684
* Dream ghosts *

08:03.717 --> 08:06.820
* Here to show you
the proper way *

08:06.854 --> 08:08.622
* We are the dream ghosts

08:08.656 --> 08:10.257
* Dream ghosts *

08:10.290 --> 08:13.694
* And the health care
with this job is just okay *

08:13.727 --> 08:15.629
* We'll help you
with decisions *

08:15.663 --> 08:17.097
* If you're on the fence

08:17.130 --> 08:20.801
* And we're available
for private events *

08:20.834 --> 08:22.903
* We're the dream ghosts

08:22.936 --> 08:25.806
* We wish our union
health plan had dental *

08:28.208 --> 08:29.610
* Dream ghosts

08:29.643 --> 08:34.548
* We pay out-of-pocket
for cleanings. *

08:34.582 --> 08:36.149
Wow, I had no idea.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.751
That ghosts exist?

08:37.784 --> 08:40.020
No, that a health plan
could exclude dental.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.087
I mean,

08:41.121 --> 08:43.823
many basic health problems
start with gingivitis.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.059
All right.
Are you ready?

08:46.093 --> 08:47.260
Now come with me.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.930
Where are we...
where are we going?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.632
We're beginning
our journey.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.701
Our spectral vacation.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.968
Here we go.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.905
Oh... we're starting

08:57.938 --> 08:59.973
with a puberty memory?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.341
Harsh.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.610
Why are we doing that?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.244
I go where the pain is.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.646
And you just,
like, admit that?

09:05.679 --> 09:07.681
You say love never
works out for you.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.751
Let's see if
it's really true.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.287
(exhales happily)

09:14.321 --> 09:15.288
AKOPIAN:
 So what is this memory?

09:15.322 --> 09:16.590
REBECCA:
 Oh, my God.

09:16.624 --> 09:17.825
This is the first time

09:17.858 --> 09:19.727
I visited my father
in Santa Fe.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.595
It's where he
moved after,

09:21.629 --> 09:23.864
you know,
the divorce.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.766
Oh, yeah, I came
here for a visit.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.300
And...?

09:28.869 --> 09:30.871
And I didn't tell him
I was coming.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.141
Surprise!

09:56.329 --> 09:58.331
Ooh, photos.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.374
(gasps)
Oh!

10:07.407 --> 10:09.609
Her Josh pictures came in.
(chuckles)

10:11.411 --> 10:12.980
(knocking)

10:13.013 --> 10:15.215
Eh, no one's here.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.250
JOSH:
Rebecca, is that you?

10:18.786 --> 10:21.121
Uh, uh, uh...

10:23.090 --> 10:24.992
Um...

10:25.025 --> 10:26.359
Hi.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.427
What are you doing here?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.262
Is Rebecca here?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.364
Uh, no.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.003
But you're here.
(chuckles)

10:36.036 --> 10:38.271
And in her bathrobe?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.974
Aren't you in Hawaii right now?

10:41.008 --> 10:42.309
What?
How do you know about that?

10:42.342 --> 10:44.845
Well, Rebecca mentioned
the surf tournament.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.080
I decided not to go.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.982
And why are you here?

10:49.016 --> 10:50.918
Well, I've been texting her
and calling her

10:50.951 --> 10:52.720
to tell her something and...

10:52.753 --> 10:54.287
(stammers)
Where is she?

10:54.321 --> 10:55.756
Well, I thought she was with--

10:55.789 --> 10:57.224
I mean, I thought
I knew where she was,

10:57.257 --> 10:59.860
but I guess I don't.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.830
*

11:02.863 --> 11:06.099
I just wanted
to see you, Daddy.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.738
I just wanted
to see you, Dad.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.206
How did you get here?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.709
Let's not talk
about logistics.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.210
They don't matter.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.212
I'm just so happy
we're together!

11:19.246 --> 11:22.482
You said if only we could
spend more vacations together.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.351
Well, I'm here.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.485
Spring break!

11:25.518 --> 11:28.188
(laughs)

11:28.221 --> 11:29.723
Well...

11:29.757 --> 11:32.092
What happened to your hair?

11:32.125 --> 11:36.063
Oh, certain hormonal changes
have occurred.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.865
It's unfortunate, but

11:37.898 --> 11:39.399
such is life.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.301
You know, your mother

11:41.334 --> 11:43.804
didn't call to tell me
you were coming.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.872
Please don't tell Naomi.

11:44.905 --> 11:45.773
She doesn't know I'm here.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.174
I told her

11:47.207 --> 11:49.376
I was at a spring break
choir camp in Poughkeepsie.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.879
I forged the forms and
created a fake P.O. box.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.815
Then I used my Bat Mitzvah
money to buy a plane ticket.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.417
But I had to use Aunt Nancy's
name for the ticket,

11:57.450 --> 11:58.819
because they don't
sell to minors,

11:58.852 --> 12:00.253
which is just
discrimination!

12:00.287 --> 12:01.789
Wow!

12:01.822 --> 12:04.357
I knew you were bright, but...

12:04.391 --> 12:05.893
Are you busy this week?

12:05.926 --> 12:07.861
Are you not happy to see me?

12:07.895 --> 12:11.264
Of course
I'm happy to see you!

12:11.298 --> 12:14.134
This is the greatest
surprise ever!

12:14.167 --> 12:16.169
(grunting)

12:17.537 --> 12:19.773
We're gonna have
a great time.

12:19.807 --> 12:20.874
(squeals)

12:20.908 --> 12:22.109
Come on, let's, uh,

12:22.142 --> 12:23.443
let's get you settled.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.813
All right.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.547
So, West Covina
wasn't the first time

12:27.580 --> 12:30.818
you made a rash decision to try
to win back the man you love.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.820
That's not--

12:32.853 --> 12:34.154
The two aren't--

12:34.187 --> 12:35.288
No, that's--

12:35.322 --> 12:36.924
They're two
different situations.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.358
I mean, clearly,

12:38.391 --> 12:39.927
my mother had been
keeping us apart

12:39.960 --> 12:41.394
and we were meant
to be together.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.197
Mm, I did some research.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.465
And I'd love to go see

12:45.498 --> 12:47.901
El Rancho de las Golondrinas
while I'm here.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.403
And of course the
Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.306
That sounds great.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.375
Why aren't you
eating your salsa?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.144
Oh, I don't know.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.211
I just hate cilantro.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.913
Me, too.
Screw cilantro.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.415
It stinks.
(laughs)

13:02.449 --> 13:04.084
We have so much in common.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.819
Yeah, we do, right?

13:05.853 --> 13:07.855
What should we do after dinner?

13:07.888 --> 13:09.957
Watch TV or play a game?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.859
Or we could just
talk about our lives

13:11.892 --> 13:13.961
and, like, our ten
favorite songs?

13:13.994 --> 13:15.829
Yeah.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.397
We can do that.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.432
(man speaking indistinctly
over television)

13:25.138 --> 13:27.140
(chuckles)

13:29.309 --> 13:31.478
REBECCA:
Maybe you're right.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.882
About there being
love in my life.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.850
He did love me.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.919
Love comes in many forms.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.954
But the kind
of love a child needs

13:40.988 --> 13:43.490
is the kind they can count on.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.959
What does that mean?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.530
Wake up, sleepyhead!

13:50.563 --> 13:53.433
I made pancakes.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.002
Oh, wow.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.503
Morning.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.770
Good morning.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.877
You know,

14:03.911 --> 14:06.113
I really do love you, Becca.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.447
Of course you do.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.649
Naomi was just
keeping us apart.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.584
Yeah.
But that's over now.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.121
And next time I won't have
to make a secret plan.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.089
I'm going to ask her

14:16.123 --> 14:18.558
if I can spend holidays
with you from now on.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.227
Well...
Wouldn't that be great?

14:20.260 --> 14:21.628
Sure.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.531
Santa Fe is-is
wonderful at Christmas.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.933
Yes, Christmas!

14:25.966 --> 14:28.401
I'm half-Christmas anyway.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.470
(doorbell rings)

14:30.503 --> 14:31.939
(sighs)

14:31.972 --> 14:33.974
Just a minute.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.148
Hi, Naomi.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.483
Silas.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.052
No.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.320
Mom, no!

14:47.354 --> 14:50.023
What is she
doing here?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.191
What are you doing here?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.026
No one asked you to come.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.028
God, I hate this part.
I hate this part.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.464
This is when she
ripped me away from him.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.598
You know, he loved me.
He did.

14:58.631 --> 14:59.933
But of course
I couldn't have that.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.368
Did you snoop around my room?

15:01.401 --> 15:02.936
Oh, you did, didn't you?!

15:02.970 --> 15:04.171
You're such a snoop!

15:04.204 --> 15:06.639
Becca, get your things
and get in the car.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.341
No.
Becca?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.143
No, you can't make me!
Listen to me.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.012
Tell her!

15:12.045 --> 15:14.414
We have plans--
the museums,

15:14.447 --> 15:17.150
holidays, Christmas, right?

15:17.184 --> 15:18.986
Rebecca, honey.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.721
Go in the car for a moment
while your mother and I talk.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.590
I'll see what I can do.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.625
All right?

15:35.368 --> 15:37.037
Okay, and I know
what happened next.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.205
She ruined everything.
(shushes)

15:38.238 --> 15:39.406
There was nothing more...

15:39.439 --> 15:40.473
Listen.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.409
NAOMI:
Silas?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.011
(sighs)

15:44.044 --> 15:45.445
Silas?

15:45.478 --> 15:47.214
She came all this way
to see you.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.116
She spent her own money.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.251
She came up
with this fakakta plan.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.754
Why do you have to make me
take her back right away?

15:54.787 --> 15:57.991
Can't you just spend time
with her for a couple of days?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.359
I'll-I'll go to a spa.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.061
I'll-I'll-I'll wait.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.595
I-I...

16:02.629 --> 16:04.031
I could use a good scrub.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.698
I have plans, Naomi.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.034
No one told me.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.568
Plans, I bet.

16:08.601 --> 16:09.669
Who is she?

16:09.702 --> 16:11.238
Oh, don't you judge me.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.472
I wasn't prepared!

16:12.505 --> 16:14.007
Prepared for what?

16:14.041 --> 16:15.275
She's your child!

16:15.308 --> 16:18.378
And-and she cooks and she

16:18.411 --> 16:21.048
does dishes and she won't
be a bother to you.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.615
For heaven's sake, Silas,

16:22.649 --> 16:24.184
be a person!
Have a heart!

16:24.217 --> 16:26.219
You're her father!
She loves you!

16:26.253 --> 16:28.555
Don't you tell me
what I should do!

16:28.588 --> 16:30.323
How to be a father!

16:30.357 --> 16:32.025
All right, when I get
my life together,

16:32.059 --> 16:34.294
when I am really settled down,
I'll come see her.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.328
Right.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.696
I'll figure out a plan.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.031
I want to.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.067
She's... she's a cute kid.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.601
She, she's not a kid!

16:41.634 --> 16:44.071
She's your daughter,
you ass!

16:44.104 --> 16:47.707
I just can't have anyone
holding me back right now.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.109
NAOMI:
Right.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.077
SILAS:
Please don't tell her.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.344
She won't understand.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.247
Don't worry, I won't tell her.

16:54.281 --> 16:57.150
Not for your sake but for hers.

16:58.385 --> 17:01.554
So she'll never know
what you're capable of.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.657
Or not capable of.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.675
And I didn't see him
for two more years.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.646
And I always blamed her.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.417
I always thought she was
the one keeping us apart.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.554
She never told
me any of this.

17:34.587 --> 17:35.588
Why?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.690
Because she didn't
want to hurt you.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.293
Because someone
 did love you.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.429
Someone still does.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.197
Just didn't happen
to be him.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.377
See, there is love
in your life.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.113
You just have to
know how to find it.

18:01.214 --> 18:04.451
That's what you take away
from that story?

18:04.484 --> 18:07.620
That my mother loved me?

18:07.654 --> 18:09.856
Okay, with all due respect,

18:09.889 --> 18:12.359
a mother's love--
that's the bare minimum.

18:12.392 --> 18:15.462
I mean, geez, serial killers
have mothers that love them.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.530
What I take away
from that story is,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.432
my father's even worse
than I thought.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.668
I always knew he was
an abandoning piece of garbage,

18:21.701 --> 18:25.572
but, geez, I thought at least
I could blame my mother for it.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.675
Can't believe she never
told me that story.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.544
She never misses
an opportunity to rub things in.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.913
Maybe you misjudged
her in some way.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.483
Maybe I did.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.251
Well, thanks a lot,
dream ghost.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.519
You just made
everything a lot worse.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.254
Because now I have
to be nicer to my mom.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.121
Boo.

18:42.155 --> 18:45.192
God, and this just
only proves my point.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.393
It's like I said.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.694
Love never lasts.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.430
Nobody really
cares about me.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.764
Where would she have gone
without telling me?

18:51.798 --> 18:52.932
It's not like her.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.267
She always tells
me everything.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.402
I don't know.
Like I said,

18:55.435 --> 18:56.403
I've been texting her
and calling her

18:56.436 --> 18:57.837
for the last day, and nothing.

18:57.870 --> 18:58.871
Why have you been texting her?

18:58.905 --> 19:00.207
Um, that's not really

19:00.240 --> 19:01.674
any of your business.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.443
(laughing):
Oh, pumpkin!

19:03.476 --> 19:06.313
If you only knew
what was my business!

19:06.346 --> 19:07.947
I know that you
and Rebecca kissed.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.483
I know that you were
gonna tell Valencia

19:10.517 --> 19:12.785
and that she was gonna
dropkick your ass.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.454
How did you...?
Wait!

19:14.487 --> 19:16.856
Did you and Valencia
not break up?

19:16.889 --> 19:19.592
Oh, no, you two are staying
together, aren't you?

19:19.626 --> 19:21.428
Again, not really any of your...

19:21.461 --> 19:22.929
And Rebecca found out!
Oh, my God!

19:22.962 --> 19:24.197
She couldn't know.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.965
I-I haven't told her yet.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.601
Okay, I just need
to calm down and think!

19:28.635 --> 19:30.737
(door opens)
I just need to calm down!

19:30.770 --> 19:32.505
Where is Rebecca?

19:33.540 --> 19:34.474
What is happening?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.875
She didn't show up for work.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.544
And I called her
and I texted her

19:37.577 --> 19:39.712
and I e-mailed her,
and nothing.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.481
Why are you wearing a bathrobe?

19:41.514 --> 19:42.615
Is that your nipple?

19:42.649 --> 19:43.616
Well...

19:43.650 --> 19:45.785
You called in sick today!

19:45.818 --> 19:47.520
It is a personal
day, Darryl!

19:47.554 --> 19:48.955
Personal!

19:48.988 --> 19:51.258
Personal means one person.
Why is he here?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.526
He is here because he is
also looking for Rebecca.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.628
Yeah, I'm starting
to get kind of worried.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.331
Oh, my God,
the cheerful man is worried?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.667
I mean, is Rebecca missing?

20:03.636 --> 20:06.606
Okay, so after that heartwarming
story with my father,

20:06.639 --> 20:08.608
you better have something
good up your ghost sleeve.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.477
After your father's
abandonment...

20:10.510 --> 20:11.644
Wow, you're a downer.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.713
...what were your other
relationships like after that?

20:13.746 --> 20:15.582
With other men?

20:15.615 --> 20:17.584
Oh, my God, they were fantastic.

20:17.617 --> 20:21.254
They were beautiful, filled
with respect and mutual orgasms.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.989
What do you think?
They were disasters.

20:23.022 --> 20:26.526
Look, I didn't show you
that last memory to upset you.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.661
I wanted you to see that
sometimes love comes up

20:28.695 --> 20:30.530
in unexpected places.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.998
(mimicking): "Oh, loves comes
in unexpect..." Is that right?

20:32.031 --> 20:34.967
Take, for instance,
sophomore year, Harvard.

20:35.001 --> 20:35.968
That play you were in.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.605
Wait, that play?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.440
That wasn't fun,
and I quit halfway through.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.541
Why is that important?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.710
But something very important
happened to you there.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.545
All right, fine,
we going back to college?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.679
Mm-hmm.
Great.

20:46.713 --> 20:49.516
Let's gain some weight.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.584
MAN:
Well, it was a tough process,
but you made it through.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.820
You are the cream of the crop.
You're late.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.356
Theodore, make a note of that in
our attendance records, please.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.058
15 people auditioned;
I could only take 11.

20:59.091 --> 21:03.663
This musical adaptation of
 Moby Dick is my senior thesis,

21:03.696 --> 21:04.797
and it is not gonna be easy.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.799
I'm so excited.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.801
I'm, like, obsessed with
the songs in the show.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.337
I've memorized them all.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.804
Wow, that's cool.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.540
Yeah.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.008
Now, as we embark
on this struggle together,

21:16.042 --> 21:18.845
this triumphant struggle--
because it will be a triumph,

21:18.878 --> 21:19.946
make no mistake about that...
What do you play?

21:19.979 --> 21:21.614
I'm Fish #3.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.082
Uh, I'm a swabber.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.552
I swab the decks,
like, the whole play.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.719
(clicks tongue)
Lucky.

21:26.753 --> 21:27.587
Guys!

21:27.620 --> 21:29.489
Let's see some focus.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.623
Thank you.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.825
Now, as I was saying...

21:32.859 --> 21:34.694
All right, good stuff,
everybody.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.597
Remember, keep your bodies
connected at all times.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.598
Point of the exercise.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.933
So I'm totally pre-law,

21:40.967 --> 21:43.470
and if my mom found out
I was doing this play,

21:43.503 --> 21:45.338
she'd, like, stop
paying my tuition.

21:45.372 --> 21:47.340
I feel kind of
stupid. Do you?

21:47.374 --> 21:48.641
Yeah.
(laughs)

21:48.675 --> 21:50.643
Guys, let's take this seriously.

21:50.677 --> 21:51.778
This exercise
will help us develop

21:51.811 --> 21:54.514
(Rebecca laughs)
a physical shorthand
with each other.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.983
Now, all right, everyone,
take a look here.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.518
Thank you.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.520
Watch me and Fish #3.

22:00.553 --> 22:01.654
Right here.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.055
Right there?
Mm-hmm, come on.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.591
Oh.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.593
O...kay.

22:06.626 --> 22:07.760
Yeah, just like that.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.796
*

22:11.698 --> 22:13.700
Okay.

22:15.602 --> 22:18.471
Well, there goes that.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.872
You're good at this.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.441
Oh, thank you.
(giggles)

22:21.474 --> 22:22.775
Oh, thanks.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.745
(panting)

22:25.778 --> 22:28.080
I'm gonna bump you
up to Fish #1.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.649
(gasps)
Thank you.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.689
Whoa.

22:36.723 --> 22:40.827
Whew, I haven't
done that in years.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.695
I...

22:42.729 --> 22:44.831
Does anybody
actually like that?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.833
(man moaning)

22:46.866 --> 22:48.835
I just...

22:48.868 --> 22:50.169
Ooh.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.704
So, wait, I'm confused.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.707
Are you trying to
tell me that Warren,

22:54.741 --> 22:57.777
the douche bag senior,
was the love of my life?

22:57.810 --> 22:59.779
(snaps)
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.781
I know what you're trying
to tell me.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.650
I know where this is going.

23:03.683 --> 23:06.986
* It's not really
about the whale *

23:07.019 --> 23:09.989
* The whale is a symbol, Ahab

23:10.022 --> 23:11.991
* Though it's a chore

23:12.024 --> 23:14.527
* I'll just mop the floor...

23:14.561 --> 23:16.663
* Ahab, can't you see?

23:16.696 --> 23:19.666
* The whale is a metaphor.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.033
Ah, that's not bad.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.201
Thanks.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.203
I saw you got bumped
up the food chain.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.572
Congrats.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.840
Oh, yeah. Yeah, thanks.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.876
You know...

23:31.578 --> 23:33.846
...I really like all this.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.016
You know,
music and theater.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.686
I hadn't done it since
this summer camp I went to,

23:39.719 --> 23:42.855
like, a million years ago, but
I forgot how happy it made me.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.724
That's great.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.192
I'm really happy for you.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.727
There.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.795
I know what
you're gonna say.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.863
You're saying that I should
have looked past Warren

23:50.897 --> 23:53.500
and gone for Peter, because he
really cared about me, right?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.835
The lesson's not over.

23:55.868 --> 23:58.204
Tell me what
happened next.

23:58.237 --> 24:02.141
You're also sleeping
with Jennifer?

24:02.174 --> 24:04.210
Like, Jennifer, as in
"Kip the Cabin Boy"?

24:04.243 --> 24:07.213
Rebecca, we never said
we were exclusive.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.849
That's not what my lifestyle
as an artist is about.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.518
But I like you.

24:11.551 --> 24:14.120
I-I really like you.
Mm-hmm.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.788
I mean, I don't know
if I can be in the play

24:15.822 --> 24:17.890
if you're just sleeping with
someone else in front of me.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.892
Well, that's your choice.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.894
There's other fish in the sea.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.996
In this case,
the metaphor applies.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.998
Uh, okay, then, well, I quit.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.500
Yeah, I quit the play.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.536
Suit yourself, Fish #1.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.507
I get what
you're saying.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.975
I made a mistake.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.243
I should have seen past

24:37.276 --> 24:40.246
my superficial feelings
for the roguish jerk

24:40.279 --> 24:42.081
to see the value
of a nice guy like Peter.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.016
Oh, God. No!

24:44.050 --> 24:45.051
(Akopian scoffs)

24:45.084 --> 24:47.053
Forget about the guys.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.921
That's the worst part
about being a ghost

24:48.955 --> 24:51.924
and working with women--
so much talk about the guys.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.593
It's like, "Guys,
forget the guys."

24:53.626 --> 24:55.094
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
I'm-I'm confused.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.630
You loved that play.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.632
You loved theater,
and you loved music,

24:59.666 --> 25:01.634
and you were gonna
change your major.

25:01.668 --> 25:05.605
You spent hours
practicing alone.

25:05.638 --> 25:06.939
* Ahab, can't you see?

25:06.973 --> 25:09.942
* The whale is a metaphor.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.177
(mumbles)

25:11.210 --> 25:12.712
* Ahab, can't you...

25:12.745 --> 25:16.716
Okay, so I loved
being in a play.

25:16.749 --> 25:17.850
But that's
not a person.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.719
So how is that
real love?

25:19.752 --> 25:21.721
Love doesn't have
to be a person.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.189
It can be a passion.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.191
And that passion
has sustained you

25:25.224 --> 25:26.859
for much of your
life, hasn't it?

25:26.893 --> 25:28.761
I guess it has.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.865
Yeah. Yeah, when
things get tough,

25:32.899 --> 25:35.735
it's how I understand
the world.

25:35.768 --> 25:39.205
Hmm, I imagine my life as
a series of musical numbers.

25:39.238 --> 25:40.873
I know.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.875
Thanks for the
solo, by the way.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.011
I always wanted to
rock some sequins.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.346
(both chuckle)

25:47.379 --> 25:50.883
As I was saying, love
comes in different forms.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.218
You know, Rebecca,
maybe it's not

25:52.251 --> 25:54.887
that you don't have
love in your life.

25:54.921 --> 25:58.725
Maybe it's that you don't
recognize it when it's there.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.193
* I am a puffer fish

26:01.227 --> 26:04.597
* I am also the queen
of denial. *

26:06.098 --> 26:09.035
We get flashlights
and we sweep the forest.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.837
Darryl, there's no forest.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.239
What about those birch trees
over by the 10 freeway?

26:13.272 --> 26:14.841
Oh, I can call her mom.

26:14.874 --> 26:17.209
Are you kidding?!
I mean, I love you,

26:17.243 --> 26:18.945
but that's... that's
a horrible idea.
(door opens)

26:18.978 --> 26:19.912
(door closes)
Yeah, no, no.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.614
Hello?

26:21.648 --> 26:23.616
Please.
Uh, what's he doing here?

26:23.650 --> 26:25.151
Darryl texted me,
uh, to come over.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.953
Something about Rebecca?
What's wrong?

26:26.986 --> 26:28.688
Yeah, she is completely
off the reservation.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.690
We don't know where she is.
Mm-hmm.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.158
When's the last time
someone talked to her?

26:32.191 --> 26:33.059
PAULA:
I saw her yesterday.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.193
But then she didn't
reply to my text,

26:34.226 --> 26:36.929
but I thought, "No, that's okay,
because she's on a trip,

26:36.963 --> 26:38.665
and wearing a bikini
and floppy hat,"

26:38.698 --> 26:39.999
but apparently she's not.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.868
Well, that's it,
I'm calling the police.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.102
GREG: Whoa, whoa,
and-and tell them what?

26:43.135 --> 26:46.305
That a person known for being
unpredictable and impulsive

26:46.338 --> 26:48.274
has been missing for a day?

26:48.307 --> 26:49.709
PAULA:
You don't understand.

26:49.742 --> 26:52.278
Rebecca always tells me
what she's doing.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.281
Paula, with all due respect,
you haven't known her that long.

26:55.314 --> 26:58.885
Okay, Greg, just because
you're super hot

26:58.918 --> 27:00.019
doesn't mean you get
to come in here

27:00.052 --> 27:03.956
and say mean statements
about my friendship, Mr. Stud.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.826
Is Greg super hot?

27:06.859 --> 27:09.061
Well, yeah, if you
like angry. Sure.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.731
JOSH:
Okay, wait-wait,
Darryl's right.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.066
Like, not about Greg being
super hot or whatever.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.134
But we need
to do something

27:15.167 --> 27:16.202
right now.
Yeah.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.303
I've had enough.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.872
I'm gonna figure out
where she is.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.410
DARRYL:
Whoa! That's not cool.

27:24.443 --> 27:27.213
What? Your friends don't
know all your passwords?

27:27.246 --> 27:29.982
Mmm, not sure I would call
them friends, then, Darryl.

27:30.016 --> 27:33.452
A'ight, let's find out

27:33.485 --> 27:34.954
what we've got here.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.123
Deleted messages.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.991
Okay, I'm out.
I'm not doing this.

27:39.025 --> 27:41.360
I'm sure she's fine
and there's nothing
to worry about.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.030
When Rebecca comes back--
probably any second--

27:44.063 --> 27:45.264
tell her I said hey.

27:45.297 --> 27:45.932
Oh, my God.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.400
JOSH: What?
What is it?

27:48.434 --> 27:50.436
Has she been catfished
by a drug smuggler?

27:50.469 --> 27:52.438
What?
I watched this TV show

27:52.471 --> 27:54.273
called Catfished
 by a Drug Smuggler.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.075
It's on the new
Catfishing Channel.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.110
Oh, my God, it is so good.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.345
I-I binged the entire thing.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.980
Okay, I know
what's happening.

28:01.013 --> 28:01.914
You do?
Yes.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.350
What?
She is moving back
to New York!

28:05.384 --> 28:08.087
At least we know
she's not dead.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.389
Uh, it's worse
than her dying.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.423
She is leaving us!

28:18.264 --> 28:20.199
*

28:20.232 --> 28:21.768
I can't believe
she's moving

28:21.801 --> 28:23.235
back to New York.

28:23.269 --> 28:26.038
Oh, that's just schmuckbait--
she's not going anywhere.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.807
She's just being dramatic.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.909
No! She has a plane ticket,
a job offer.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.744
She's looking at sublets.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.980
Oh, my God,
she didn't tell me any of this!

28:34.013 --> 28:36.448
And as quickly
as she entered our lives,

28:36.482 --> 28:39.085
poof... she's gone.
Oh, stop it,

28:39.118 --> 28:40.419
Darryl, she's not gone, okay?

28:40.452 --> 28:42.421
She's not allowed
to disappear on me.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.423
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
I'm so confused.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.525
She said she hated
living in New York.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.795
We talk about it all the time.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.529
I mean, she wasn't happy there.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.031
Yeah, but sometimes
there are things

28:52.064 --> 28:53.499
that are more important
than being happy.

28:53.532 --> 28:56.068
I was... unhappily married.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.170
But I had a child
and I stuck it out.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.539
For years.
She can't do this.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.009
She can't just opt out
because it got hard.

29:03.042 --> 29:06.012
I mean, you don't think
I want to opt out every day?

29:06.045 --> 29:07.546
You think I don't want
to unsubscribe

29:07.579 --> 29:09.916
from, like,
half the things in my life?

29:09.949 --> 29:13.352
Paula, if that's true, then
you should change your life.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.454
People actually do that.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.324
Not me, but, you know...
I still don't get it.

29:18.357 --> 29:19.491
This town is great.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.961
She told me she loved it here.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.831
Why would she want to leave?

29:24.864 --> 29:26.498
REBECCA:
 So let's recap.

29:26.532 --> 29:30.002
My mother loves me,
I love music.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.303
Fantastic.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.538
You're skirting the real issue

29:32.571 --> 29:34.573
which got us here
in the first place,

29:34.606 --> 29:37.576
which is that I can't
find anybody to love me.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.545
Like, real love.
Like, boy-girl love.

29:39.578 --> 29:41.814
I mean, that's... okay,
that's gender normative.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.149
But you get what
I'm saying, right?

29:43.182 --> 29:45.852
It's like me lovee you,
kissy kissy kissy time,

29:45.885 --> 29:48.020
we make babies now,
and I'm doing an accent.

29:48.054 --> 29:49.956
I don't know why
I'm doing an accent.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.891
(chuckles): Look, you're
not the only person

29:51.924 --> 29:53.926
to have difficulties
in this area.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.195
Maybe you don't have
one special person,

29:56.228 --> 29:57.596
but you have many people.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.965
Plural people?

30:00.399 --> 30:02.401
*

30:05.571 --> 30:07.106
Hello?

30:10.943 --> 30:12.945
They're here because
they love you.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.482
What?

30:16.515 --> 30:17.549
No.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.618
Mm-hmm.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.853
No.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.489
No.

30:23.522 --> 30:24.857
(exhales)

30:25.892 --> 30:28.527
Oh, they all look
so worried.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.863
I should text Paula.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.498
Can I text someone from a dream?

30:32.531 --> 30:35.067
Okay, guess I can't.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.235
Yes, yes, yes.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.904
Oh, it's my bonus check.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.505
I'm not broke anymore.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.908
I can buy back my Hyundai!

30:41.941 --> 30:42.909
Yay!
Shh!

30:42.942 --> 30:44.343
Listen!

30:44.376 --> 30:45.577
God, you talk too much.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.179
(mimicking):
Talk too much.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.916
Can't believe my cookie
is moving away.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.651
We had some really
great times together.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.421
DARRYL:
She was the best employee
I ever had.

30:55.454 --> 30:58.657
No, I mean...
it wasn't just that.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.659
Rebecca made me wake up.

31:00.692 --> 31:04.030
You know, if it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't have changed my life.

31:05.164 --> 31:07.533
JOSH:
Me neither.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.202
I mean, she got me
that job at Aloha's.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.204
She helped me believe in myself

31:12.238 --> 31:15.474
for the first time, like...
ever.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.277
PAULA:
She helped me
with my marriage.

31:18.310 --> 31:21.880
She was like...
a surrogate daughter.

31:27.619 --> 31:28.587
What, me?

31:28.620 --> 31:29.588
I got nothin'.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.190
She's done nothing
but cause problems for me.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.658
I don't even know
why I'm still here.

31:32.691 --> 31:35.694
REBECCA:
Okay, so all these people
are technically here,

31:35.727 --> 31:38.597
but that doesn't necessarily
mean they love me.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.100
Let's contrast how
they're feeling

31:41.133 --> 31:43.135
with the way people felt
when you left New York.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.039
Whoa...

31:47.073 --> 31:49.041
Well, good riddance
to bad rubbish.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.010
Hear, hear.
Cheers.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.711
You know what?

31:52.744 --> 31:55.681
Now that I think about it,

31:55.714 --> 31:58.184
I might miss her.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.219
(all laughing)

32:03.189 --> 32:04.256
Good one, right?

32:06.225 --> 32:07.226
God, she's a heinous bitch.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.004
AKOPIAN:
 West Covina was the first place

32:18.037 --> 32:20.372
that you acted
like a person.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.041
And because of it,

32:22.074 --> 32:23.742
you forged true
relationships.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.943
Look how worried they are.

32:26.412 --> 32:29.448
Look at how everyone
cares about you.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.083
No, not everyone.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.021
He probably knows me
as well as anyone here.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.688
He doesn't care
if I live or die.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.090
You heard him.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.325
Are you sure?

32:39.358 --> 32:41.227
Are you sure
he doesn't care?

32:41.260 --> 32:43.595
I mean, I thought I was,

32:43.629 --> 32:45.397
but now that
you say it like that,

32:45.431 --> 32:47.033
I'm not so sure anymore.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.700
Look at his phone.

32:48.734 --> 32:51.670
(sighs)

32:54.706 --> 32:56.708
Wait, won't he notice
if I grab his phone?

32:56.742 --> 32:58.610
Again, dream.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.246
Ghost. Illusion.

33:00.279 --> 33:03.215
Let me just freeze
everything for a second.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.018
Whoa!

33:06.052 --> 33:07.686
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.488
Your powers are so cool.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.790
This is amazing.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.060
This is so cool.
Wait, like...

33:14.093 --> 33:15.494
how does one become
a dream ghost?

33:15.527 --> 33:16.762
What's the application
process like?

33:16.795 --> 33:19.065
'Cause this, I could do
some damage with...
(clears throat)

33:19.098 --> 33:20.766
Right. Greg's phone,
Greg's phone.

33:20.799 --> 33:21.767
Okay.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.801
Look at his calls.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.137
The ones he made before
he knew you were safe.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.110
Okay.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.115
Oh, my God.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.119
He called every hospital
in the area.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.354
And some morgues.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.323
Now, why would
he do that?

33:44.356 --> 33:47.126
Because he's hoping I was dead?

33:48.194 --> 33:51.063
Because he cares about me.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.099
What do you think?

33:55.834 --> 33:58.604
I mean...
he doesn't show it.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.073
He's always
so angry at me.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.641
Yeah, hot guys are
kind of like that.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.077
The middle-aged ladies
really dig Greg.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.412
Oh, yes.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.813
I wish he was a search
term on porn sites.

34:08.847 --> 34:12.618
Okay, let's cool it,
Dream Ghost.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.721
But this is not about
Greg or any one man--

34:15.754 --> 34:17.723
it is about you, Rebecca.

34:17.755 --> 34:18.790
God, do you know
how hard it is

34:18.824 --> 34:20.759
to pass the Bechdel test
when you're a dream ghost?

34:20.792 --> 34:22.694
Oh. Yeah, I bet.

34:22.728 --> 34:26.498
There's a lot of love
in your life, Rebecca.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.467
If you opened your heart

34:28.500 --> 34:30.502
to the possibilities
of all kinds of love,

34:30.536 --> 34:32.838
something good
might happen.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.172
You spend so much
time obsessing

34:34.206 --> 34:35.774
about this one here,

34:35.806 --> 34:38.110
you've lost sight
of everything else.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.478
And everyone else.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.849
I've just been dreaming
about him for so long.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.884
(Rebecca scoffs)

34:45.917 --> 34:49.420
Like, most
of my life.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.590
He is the dream, Dream Ghost.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.792
But he is
an illusion.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.893
Just like I am.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.830
Maybe it's time you see

34:58.864 --> 35:00.466
what else is in your life

35:00.499 --> 35:03.202
besides Josh Chan.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.172
Wake up, Rebecca.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.773
(exclaims)

35:07.806 --> 35:09.841
What's wrong?

35:11.177 --> 35:13.179
Oh, my God.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.848
You were right.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.885
Everything you said was right.

35:19.918 --> 35:22.888
Uh, I didn't say anything.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.590
You've been busy sleeping

35:24.623 --> 35:26.892
and I've been binge-
watching Broad City.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.860
(chuckles)
It's so funny.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.662
These girls just don't care.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.299
Oh. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.600
No, I know this game.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.668
I know how dream ghosts work.

35:36.702 --> 35:40.172
Right, 'cause it was all a dream
and you were a ghost,

35:40.206 --> 35:41.940
but now you're gonna
do something all winky

35:41.973 --> 35:45.211
and I'm gonna go,
"Wait, it was all real."

35:45.244 --> 35:47.313
(laughs)
I think you need more therapy

35:47.346 --> 35:48.880
than I initially thought.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.217
Maybe you should
come in twice a week.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.252
Yeah, okay.
Whatever you say.

35:53.285 --> 35:55.387
But oh, my gosh,
you changed my life,

35:55.421 --> 35:57.423
Dr. Dream Ghost Akopian.

35:57.456 --> 36:00.559
Oh, you made me...
you made me see past

36:00.592 --> 36:02.928
all of my delusions
that were been holding me back.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.631
Oh, and it's the other dream
ghosts. I have to thank them.

36:05.664 --> 36:06.932
Thank you, other dream ghosts.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.801
Excuse me, lady?

36:09.835 --> 36:11.470
She's the one that was
snoring and grunting.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.605
You-you guys
should all get dental.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.341
How many sleeping pills
have you had?

36:15.374 --> 36:16.842
So many.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.253
It would be such a bummer
if she moved away

36:27.286 --> 36:28.287
without even
saying good-bye.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.489
Well, maybe we can think
of some way to make her

36:30.522 --> 36:33.525
stay here in town.
What would make her stay?

36:35.761 --> 36:37.396
Come here a second.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.434
If you want Rebecca
to stay in town,

36:42.468 --> 36:43.569
you can make that happen.

36:43.602 --> 36:44.736
What?

36:44.770 --> 36:46.538
Oh, God.

36:46.572 --> 36:49.341
Josh, you don't understand?

36:49.375 --> 36:52.811
You don't see what this has
all been about for Rebecca?

36:52.844 --> 36:54.480
I-I... don't understand
what you're...

36:54.513 --> 36:56.915
Well, I'm out.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.617
(grunts softly)

36:58.650 --> 37:00.386
If she decides
to sell the furniture,

37:00.419 --> 37:02.354
I call dibs on the big fish.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.356
Wait, what are you saying?

37:04.390 --> 37:07.426
I'm saying... look at these.

37:16.668 --> 37:17.803
Guys, wait,

37:17.836 --> 37:19.271
I hear something.

37:19.305 --> 37:20.539
(door opens)

37:23.575 --> 37:25.010
You're here!

37:25.043 --> 37:27.279
(laughing)
Yeah.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.315
Yeah, I, uh...

37:29.348 --> 37:31.617
I got on a plane
and then I

37:31.650 --> 37:34.586
got off and got right back
on another plane

37:34.620 --> 37:36.788
and I've been in the same outfit
for ten hours

37:36.822 --> 37:38.957
and I feel and smell terrific.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.692
We found out about New York.

37:40.726 --> 37:43.529
I-I looked on your laptop.

37:43.562 --> 37:44.663
I assumed you would.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.698
You're back for now or for good?

37:46.732 --> 37:50.569
Um...

37:50.602 --> 37:52.704
for good.
Oh, thank God.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.540
We really thought you
were gone. (laughs)

37:54.573 --> 37:56.041
I knew you weren't
going anywhere.

37:56.074 --> 37:59.445
You've got your reasons
for living in this town.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.580
Welcome back, Bunch.

38:01.613 --> 38:02.881
I'm out.
Hey.

38:02.914 --> 38:05.684
Um... thank you for being here.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.824
See you later, suckers.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.562
I am so glad you're okay.

38:16.595 --> 38:17.763
Oh...

38:17.796 --> 38:19.631
Mm!

38:19.665 --> 38:21.400
Please don't ever
leave me again.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.568
It hurts my heart.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.636
Oh, Darryl.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.610
Hey, um, why are you
in my bathrobe?

38:31.643 --> 38:33.812
Oh, that's a long story.
I will tell you later.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.647
(both chuckle)

38:37.716 --> 38:38.650
Oh, my God.

38:40.519 --> 38:43.121
Okay, I got to go.
Uh, you kids talk,

38:43.154 --> 38:45.391
I am going to wash this bathrobe

38:45.424 --> 38:47.859
and give it to you at work.
I am so glad you're back!

38:47.893 --> 38:49.895
Okay, bye!

38:52.464 --> 38:55.767
Um...

38:55.801 --> 38:59.638
so... I see my pictures arrived.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.441
Rebecca, what are all these?

39:02.474 --> 39:03.842
Why do you have them?

39:05.644 --> 39:07.413
Rebecca...

39:08.847 --> 39:11.383
...are you in love with me?

39:14.820 --> 39:16.688
I want to go to the nearest
planet with intelligent life

39:16.722 --> 39:18.390
and see a play.

39:18.424 --> 39:20.526
This alien play is amazing.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.528
He loved her so much,

39:22.561 --> 39:24.730
he traveled to Planet
Fnorg to see her.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.798
Even though that planet
is mostly sulfur

39:26.832 --> 39:28.600
and zerps can't even
breathe sulfur.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.802
He would rather have
five minutes with her

39:30.836 --> 39:32.704
than live another
30 years.

39:32.738 --> 39:36.408
Love-- is there anything
more universal?
(squeals)

39:37.676 --> 39:39.545
Oh!
Yes!

39:40.579 --> 39:41.813
Go!

39:41.847 --> 39:43.849
Work!
