WEBVTT

00:18.686 --> 00:20.521
Flint:
Somewhere under there
is our thief.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.922
Where's the page?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.657
Your schedule is up here.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.294
You want to kill Hamund?
Then you have to kill them all.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.162
- Ah!
- Rackham: When you
and Miss Guthrie

00:28.262 --> 00:29.563
were plotting
this little coup,

00:29.663 --> 00:31.199
the two of you come up
with some idea

00:31.299 --> 00:32.732
how to deal
with the captain
when he returns?

00:32.833 --> 00:34.835
Bonny:
You don't know where
he's gone, do you?

00:34.935 --> 00:36.504
Eleanor:
You could be strong again.

00:36.604 --> 00:39.006
You could take
this whole island from me.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.875
You know exactly
what it is you need to do,

00:41.975 --> 00:43.777
where it is you need
to go to do it.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.480
I certainly didn't expect
to find you down in the hold,

00:46.580 --> 00:49.417
not after you betrayed
Miss Guthrie on behalf
of her father.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.385
Found in Bryson's cabin.
It's from the Barlow woman.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.521
She wants a pardon
for Flint in Boston.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.823
She says we're going
to kill him when we learn
of his betrayal.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.891
Gates:
The Scarborough!

00:57.991 --> 00:59.593
Flint:
Man overboard!

00:59.693 --> 01:02.730
- It's Billy! He fell!
- We can't turn back.

01:07.368 --> 01:10.404
( theme music playing )

02:42.263 --> 02:44.232
- ( wind blowing )
- ( birds calling )

02:48.369 --> 02:50.304
Lambrick:
Easter is upon us--

02:50.404 --> 02:54.308
an opportunity for renewal
and rebirth...

02:56.444 --> 02:59.580
both in spirit
and the flesh.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.316
And yet we may also
ask ourselves,

03:02.416 --> 03:06.119
"When the spirit is renewed
and the body resurrected,

03:06.220 --> 03:08.556
what becomes of the sin?"

03:10.324 --> 03:12.726
Will not a trace
of it linger

03:12.826 --> 03:15.829
to mock and torment us,

03:15.929 --> 03:18.599
to remind us of the roiling
pit of despair

03:18.699 --> 03:21.669
that awaits the unrepentant
beyond this life?

03:21.769 --> 03:25.038
And yet does it not often
feel as if life itself
is the pit?

03:25.138 --> 03:26.874
Yah!

03:41.622 --> 03:42.456
Ma'am!

03:42.556 --> 03:45.393
Captain Flint's returned.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.263
Eleanor:
Captain.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.467
Captain.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.270
Captain!

03:57.605 --> 03:59.973
Sorry, you were asking
about the Scarborough?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.810
I was, specifically
how the hell did she
find you out there?

04:02.910 --> 04:05.679
A trap
laid by your father,

04:05.779 --> 04:08.516
for which he will
be answering as soon
as I'm finished here.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.052
He won't be
the only one, I assume.

04:12.152 --> 04:16.055
Your friend
Mrs. Barlow understood
she was responsible

04:16.156 --> 04:17.757
for keeping him
under lock and key.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.459
You trusted her.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.928
We trusted her
and she betrayed us.

04:21.028 --> 04:24.798
Perhaps he managed to secrete
a message past her men.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.167
That hardly rises
to the level of betrayal.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.570
( scoffs )

04:29.670 --> 04:33.374
Captain, yesterday morning,
my father walked into town,

04:33.474 --> 04:34.975
stood out on the steps
of the warehouse

04:35.075 --> 04:37.010
and proclaimed to the world
that the Guthries' business

04:37.110 --> 04:38.879
is finished here in Nassau.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.381
What was the reaction?

04:40.481 --> 04:43.317
The men elected
representatives,

04:43.417 --> 04:45.786
we agreed upon
an agenda,

04:45.886 --> 04:49.390
and we spoke about the merits
of mutual cooperation over tea.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.259
So it was bad?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.827
Bad?
It was fucking chaos.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.697
- Yeah.
- Eleanor:
For about an hour,

04:56.797 --> 04:58.799
I thought they had
burned down all of Nassau.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.568
But it's been handled.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.371
As of last night,
I've instituted a new
trading system

05:03.471 --> 05:06.106
and the street
has embraced it.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.609
A consortium with myself
at its head,

05:08.709 --> 05:11.479
Captains Naft and Lawrence
as a means of shipping,

05:11.579 --> 05:14.782
and Mr. Frasier
as its corporate seal.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.384
Hmm.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.552
All this since yesterday?

05:20.754 --> 05:24.925
I will address the situation
with Mrs. Barlow immediately.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.660
You have my word.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.497
( clears throat )

05:29.597 --> 05:31.465
Captain, one more thing.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.468
The consortium
wasn't founded easily.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.570
It required the assistance
of a few other parties.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.840
Among them indispensably
was Mr. Silver.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.643
Is that so?

05:42.743 --> 05:44.144
Eleanor:
I tell you this
because I imagine

05:44.244 --> 05:46.680
you might still hold
some resentment toward him.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.016
And I've given him
my word in exchange
for his assistance

05:49.116 --> 05:52.052
that I'll stand between
him and your resentment.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.489
In other words,

05:55.589 --> 05:58.091
if Mr. Silver doesn't
return from the Urca,

05:58.191 --> 06:00.861
you and I may find ourselves
with problems of our own.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.900
What a day I missed.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.608
Come on.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.046
( panting )

06:27.455 --> 06:29.389
The fuck, Jack?

06:29.490 --> 06:32.192
It's gone limp again.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.629
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.266
Well, do you want
something up your ass?

06:39.366 --> 06:41.435
No.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.136
No, thank you.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.541
( grunts )

06:50.177 --> 06:51.679
What the fuck
is your problem?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.716
I'm terribly sorry
if I've ruined your morning,

06:55.816 --> 06:58.085
but at the moment
I happen to have
quite a lot on my mind.

06:58.185 --> 07:01.188
Ship purloined,
captain and crew
a distant memory,

07:01.288 --> 07:03.757
no prospects at all,

07:03.857 --> 07:05.593
except for this shithole
of a brothel,

07:05.693 --> 07:09.096
which by some miracle
of economics seems incapable
of turning a profit.

07:09.196 --> 07:12.365
How can you
run a brothel here
and not make money?

07:12.466 --> 07:14.902
I have no fucking idea!

07:15.002 --> 07:18.539
Ain't you always
the one telling everyone
how fucking clever you are?

07:21.909 --> 07:23.176
Figure it out.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.681
Don't you dare
leave me here.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.518
- Don't you--
- ( door slams )

07:30.618 --> 07:33.654
( distant donkey braying )

07:43.664 --> 07:47.034
Alice made you
her porridge.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.037
Thicker than snot,
but it'll help you
get your strength back.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.711
A couple of us are wondering
what you plan to do now.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.913
Why would anyone
care what I do?

08:00.013 --> 08:02.616
Darling, you're all
anyone's talking about
out there.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.618
All of us wondering
what kind of voodoo
you used

08:04.718 --> 08:07.154
to get eight
of Vane's crew
to just...

08:07.254 --> 08:08.556
up and disappear.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.258
Haven't you heard?

08:11.358 --> 08:13.260
They left for Port Royal.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.596
Hmm, and I'm Henry
fuckin' Avery.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.901
If you've got any thought
of working here again,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.170
- I wouldn't wait too long.
- What do you mean?

08:23.270 --> 08:25.873
Mr. Rackham's got no idea
how to run this place.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.575
We've all got a hand
in his pocket.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.042
Mapleton would tell him,

08:29.142 --> 08:31.044
but she's too busy
stealing for herself.

08:31.144 --> 08:34.615
Mapleton:
Idelle! Downstairs.
Customer.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.684
All I'm saying is get in
while the getting's good.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.589
( door closes )

08:44.357 --> 08:46.594
( grunts )

08:46.694 --> 08:49.897
Jesus!
The fuck
did they do to you?

08:49.997 --> 08:51.665
Postelection initiation,
I'm told.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.701
All done in good fun.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.335
At least...
( chuckles )

08:55.435 --> 08:57.571
I think it was all done
in good fun.

08:57.671 --> 09:01.208
- Congratulations,
Mr. Quartermaster.
- Thank you.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.743
Unfortunate,
to say the least,

09:02.843 --> 09:04.444
that we find ourselves
in the need of one.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.079
Yes, very.

09:06.179 --> 09:09.182
But I'm humbled
by the crew's faith in me.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.319
Well, if Billy
were here,

09:12.419 --> 09:13.721
I'm sure he would
agree with me

09:13.821 --> 09:16.023
when I say that
the crew chose well.

09:16.123 --> 09:19.126
Well, much to do.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.932
Mr. Dufresne,
quartermaster.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.034
Who would've seen
that coming?

09:27.134 --> 09:29.302
- I think he's up to it.
- I'm sure he is.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.405
I just wouldn't have thought
the crew capable of coming
to that conclusion.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.142
Well, chew a man's
throat out, it tends
to make an impression.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.111
( both chuckle )

09:38.211 --> 09:40.347
You'll be heading
to see her now, then?

09:43.717 --> 09:45.518
Mrs. Barlow.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.020
You said you'd be
holding her to account.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.257
I assumed you'd
not want to wait.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.994
I'll be back
before dark.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.997
We'll continue preparations
for our departure then.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.642
Gates:
Just one more
thing, Captain,

10:08.742 --> 10:11.578
before you leave
to see Mrs. Barlow.

10:11.679 --> 10:15.115
I think you and I need
to discuss the letter
that Billy found...

10:16.817 --> 10:18.852
and why exactly it is
that she believes

10:18.952 --> 10:20.921
you're gonna betray
your crew.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.698
- ( grunts )
- Hey, get back.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.465
Jesus, Randall.

10:32.565 --> 10:33.667
( panting )

10:33.767 --> 10:35.736
De Groot:
Mate.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.574
Randall would like
a word with you.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.877
- Council just voted.
He's out.
- Out?

10:43.977 --> 10:46.213
De Groot:
I suppose it's my fault.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.916
I raised the concern
about the fire hazard

10:49.016 --> 10:51.584
a one-legged man
in the galley might
present.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.721
And like most things
before the council,

10:53.821 --> 10:55.355
it spun out of control.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.590
What's that got
to do with me?

10:57.691 --> 10:59.927
He's got a raw deal,
Mr. Silver.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.996
The least we can do
is let him say his piece.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.034
( Silver sighs )

11:07.134 --> 11:08.702
Randall.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.905
It's not fair.
I can cook.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.642
Yes, I think you might
have mentioned that.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.678
You know, it's been
my experience

11:18.779 --> 11:22.816
setbacks such as these,
they often go hand in hand

11:22.916 --> 11:25.452
with new and unexpected
opportunities.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.887
He's a thief.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.793
What are you
talking about, Randall?

11:32.893 --> 11:37.164
He thought I was asleep
at Miss Guthrie's tavern.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.833
I heard him talking.

11:39.933 --> 11:43.236
Wasn't Singleton
stole the page,
it was him.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.943
I don't know
what he's talking about.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.847
Randall, are you
being truthful?

11:53.947 --> 11:56.850
He said he has
the schedule in his head,

11:56.950 --> 11:59.987
that he learned it
to stop Flint from
murdering him.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.090
All due respect,
but he spent the last two days

12:03.190 --> 12:05.525
beneath a rather heavy
cloud of opiates.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.996
- He doesn't know what he heard.
- Get the quartermaster in here.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.865
Right now.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.607
Bear with me.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.876
One minute, please.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.979
Uh, apologies.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.480
( snaps fingers )
Give me it.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.456
Ah! Here it is.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.593
It is with great pleasure
that we shall now commence

12:40.693 --> 12:44.865
our inaugural meeting
of the Guthrie Frasier
Naft Lawrence Consortium

12:44.965 --> 12:46.599
for the Purposes
of Shipping and Trade

12:46.699 --> 12:49.269
in the West Indies,
Excelsior.

12:54.307 --> 12:58.111
Reginald, add to the agenda
discussion of a shorter name.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.547
Jesus.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.316
First item of business...

13:03.416 --> 13:05.385
our maiden voyage.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.587
Captain Lawrence,

13:07.687 --> 13:11.024
the status
of the Black Hind, please.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.460
( clears throat )

13:13.560 --> 13:17.130
We've begun alterations
to expand our holds.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.266
- But as I predicted...
- O'Malley: Ma'am.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.034
...a good number
of the crew have defected

13:21.134 --> 13:23.904
upon learning
of their new vocation.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.542
Any suggestions
for a new source of labor
would certainly be welcomed.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.078
What happened to you?

13:31.178 --> 13:33.780
I told him
to get the fuck out,
but he wouldn't go.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.348
He who?

13:51.498 --> 13:53.033
Eleanor:
Quite the story
I heard out there

13:53.133 --> 13:55.068
from the Walrus' men.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.570
They say you
rallied the slaves

13:57.670 --> 14:00.107
in the Andromache's hold,

14:00.207 --> 14:03.210
single-handedly turned
the tides against Bryson.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.247
Imagine what they'd say
if they knew that
you're the reason

14:07.347 --> 14:09.249
that they had
to chase that ship
in the first place.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.385
- I would like the chance
to explain myself.
- I'm listening.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.326
What I did,
I did out of love.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.894
( scoffs )

14:20.994 --> 14:23.931
And with every intention
of staying here with you
to help you find a safer,

14:24.031 --> 14:26.633
more settled life,
a life you deserve.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.737
It was not a betrayal.

14:30.837 --> 14:31.972
It was--

14:32.072 --> 14:33.974
It was not
your decision to make.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.309
My life is my own.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.212
It's not
Benjamin Hornigold's,
it's not Charles Vane's,

14:39.312 --> 14:41.714
it's not my father's
and it's not yours.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.484
Do you understand?

14:46.053 --> 14:48.388
You're right.
I'm sorry.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.291
And what?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.426
Now you think you can
just waltz back in here

14:53.526 --> 14:56.463
and pick up from
where we left off
like nothing happened?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.601
Where else would I go?

15:02.769 --> 15:04.604
I belong to you.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.541
Chattel property
of the Guthrie estate.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.016
You-- you know I've never
seen you that way.

15:18.218 --> 15:22.555
Eleanor, I must ask
a favor of you.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.600
( bird screeching )

15:33.700 --> 15:36.569
( distant chopping )

15:46.479 --> 15:48.248
He's waiting.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.276
Sit.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.419
You wish to do business?

17:02.255 --> 17:04.491
There's a place...

17:06.193 --> 17:08.761
there's a place
not far from here.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.798
A place fueled by plunder.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.400
A place of great wealth

17:13.500 --> 17:16.502
run by its crews
and flying no flag.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.071
I know of Nassau.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.342
What of it?

17:22.442 --> 17:23.810
She's weak,

17:23.910 --> 17:26.679
so she's ripe
for the taking.

17:26.779 --> 17:30.183
A man with enough strength
could get his hands

17:30.283 --> 17:32.819
wrapped around her throat
in a matter of hours,

17:32.919 --> 17:36.556
control the flow
of trade, get rich.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.460
My men are rich.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.297
Wood sells well
and we don't rely
on the mercy of the sea.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.936
No man is rich who could have
a lot more by doing less.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.605
( flies buzzing )

17:55.175 --> 17:57.744
When you sailed
as captain of these men,

17:57.844 --> 17:59.912
they sacked Campeche
for you.

18:00.012 --> 18:03.015
They sacked
Cartagena for you.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.951
Give me a dozen of them

18:05.051 --> 18:07.654
and I will bring
Nassau in line.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.558
What's your name?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.829
Charles Vane.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.801
I know that name.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.738
These are my men.

18:25.838 --> 18:29.242
Why would I let any of them
call you captain?

18:29.342 --> 18:31.344
Each man gets a share,

18:31.444 --> 18:35.348
plus one share to you
in tribute for every six men.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.251
That's a sizeable piece
of a fucking fortune.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.487
And all you need do
is give them your leave.

18:47.327 --> 18:50.129
How did you know
to seek me out?

18:52.232 --> 18:55.235
Is my name spoken
as far as Nassau?

18:57.737 --> 19:00.507
Is there someone there
that connects us?

19:02.975 --> 19:05.645
Or is it something else?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.916
The fuck do you care?

19:14.454 --> 19:16.689
Do we have a deal
or don't we?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.931
Three men.

19:26.733 --> 19:30.903
My tribute-- a share
for every three men.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.405
Four shares in all.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.809
Yes or no?

19:40.213 --> 19:41.981
You're not answering
the question.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.385
I'm trying to answer
the question.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.186
So you're saying
she's lying?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.821
That the letter
is just a fiction?

19:48.921 --> 19:52.359
I'm saying that
my relationship with her
is a complex one...

19:53.760 --> 19:56.829
that it's hard for me
to understand at times.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.766
But what is clear
is that she desperately
wants to leave this place

19:59.866 --> 20:02.935
and will say anything
in order to make me
go with her.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.971
Oh, for fuck's sake,
enough.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.508
This is what we do.

20:08.608 --> 20:12.345
You orate and you dissemble,
and I look the other way,

20:12.445 --> 20:15.248
convince myself
that supporting you

20:15.348 --> 20:17.116
is in everybody's
interests.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.019
But not today.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.521
Not after what happened
last night.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.590
After what happened
last night?

20:23.690 --> 20:26.393
What happened
to Billy, Captain?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.497
He fell.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.699
Why? What are you
saying happened?

20:34.401 --> 20:36.002
He thought
you saw us all
as expendable.

20:36.102 --> 20:39.839
- Expendable?
- Pawns to be used
for your own ends.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.943
I have fought and bled
alongside my men.

20:44.043 --> 20:48.214
I have sacrificed more
than you could possibly
know for their futures.

20:48.315 --> 20:52.552
I know what happened
on the Maria Aleyne.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.153
You told me
the man you killed

20:54.253 --> 20:56.188
was reaching for a weapon.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.224
You told me
it was self-defense,

20:58.325 --> 21:01.227
but there were no weapons
in that cabin.

21:01.328 --> 21:04.297
I went and I looked.

21:04.397 --> 21:08.635
And I still kept
my mouth shut.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.503
I don't know why,

21:10.603 --> 21:14.774
but I know you used the crew
to assassinate those people.

21:14.874 --> 21:17.009
Men died that day.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.545
Our men.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.513
And I suspect
there's been other times

21:20.613 --> 21:22.549
when we've been
expendable to you.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.952
And if yesterday
was one of those days,

21:26.052 --> 21:28.355
then you and I have
a problem,

21:28.455 --> 21:32.158
because Billy
wasn't expendable

21:32.258 --> 21:34.060
to me.

21:36.195 --> 21:39.298
He was a son to me.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.535
Then perhaps
you should have acted

21:42.635 --> 21:45.237
like a better father
towards him.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.273
What the fuck
did you just say?

21:47.374 --> 21:49.676
You let his suspicions
run rampant.

21:49.776 --> 21:53.212
You let his paranoia fester
to the point at which

21:53.312 --> 21:56.449
when he should
have been focused
on the Scarborough's guns,

21:56.549 --> 22:00.587
he was focused on hurling
unfounded accusations at me.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.589
So I'm to blame
for what happened to Billy?

22:02.689 --> 22:04.290
Perhaps if you
had intervened

22:04.391 --> 22:06.393
when he first came to you
with these fantasies,

22:06.493 --> 22:08.695
perhaps if you
helped him understand

22:08.795 --> 22:10.963
the world in which
he lived...

22:12.765 --> 22:14.934
he'd still be here
right now.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.109
Where are you going?

22:25.177 --> 22:27.013
I'm tired of this.

22:29.549 --> 22:33.420
I'm tired of the energy
it takes to believe you.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.457
To believe in you.

22:40.627 --> 22:43.863
I'm taking this to the crew.
You're their problem now.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.634
I'm taking it.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.507
After the Urca
has been secured

22:54.607 --> 22:57.477
and the money warehoused
before distribution...

22:59.712 --> 23:03.182
I intend to sequester
a portion of it.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.384
- Sequester?
- A portion of it.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.289
Every man on that crew
will still be richer

23:10.389 --> 23:12.592
than their wildest dreams.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.527
But you know
as well as I do

23:14.627 --> 23:16.529
that no matter how much
money they're given,

23:16.629 --> 23:19.098
they will drink, whore
and piss it away.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.734
Now, they have
a chance at something
better than that,

23:21.834 --> 23:24.871
but it isn't gonna
happen unless somebody
makes it happen.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.005
You're lying to them.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.240
And if I don't, who will?

23:28.340 --> 23:31.911
Everyone's lied to
for their own good--

23:32.011 --> 23:34.313
every mother who tells
their child

23:34.413 --> 23:36.616
that everything
will be all right,

23:36.716 --> 23:38.651
every soldier
who's told by his commander

23:38.751 --> 23:40.252
that courage
will see them through,

23:40.352 --> 23:41.888
every subject
who's told by--

23:41.988 --> 23:43.523
His king?

23:45.958 --> 23:49.128
Is that what you are
to us now?

23:49.228 --> 23:53.065
A sovereign
levying a tax?

23:55.334 --> 23:58.971
If no one knows,
everyone wins.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.474
- Don't play games with me.
- I'm quite serious.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.810
Who loses?

24:03.910 --> 24:05.545
Absent their
worst instincts,

24:05.645 --> 24:07.680
their pride, their greed,
their suspicion,

24:07.780 --> 24:10.983
in the light
of pure reason,

24:11.083 --> 24:13.953
who says no to this?

24:14.053 --> 24:16.923
They'll be rich men
in a safe place

24:17.023 --> 24:20.627
rather than dead thieves
on a long rope.

24:23.596 --> 24:26.599
I'm gonna
deliver them, Hal.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.235
I'm gonna deliver them
into something better.

24:34.306 --> 24:38.711
I will sail
with you tomorrow
to take this prize.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.848
I'll follow your lead
in battle.

24:41.948 --> 24:45.217
And I'll take your orders
as consort.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.153
But when it's done,

24:47.253 --> 24:50.590
you and I will quietly
go our separate ways.

24:50.690 --> 24:55.127
And I'll thank you
not to protest.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.944
No one else knows
about this?

25:12.044 --> 25:14.647
Look, as far as I can tell,
it's just the three of us.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.649
Then again, this is Randall
we're talking about.

25:16.749 --> 25:20.186
If he had
told anyone else,
we'd have heard.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.789
Does it make
any sense to you?

25:22.889 --> 25:25.625
Well, Flint finding
that page on Singleton

25:25.725 --> 25:28.294
does seem
awfully convenient
in hindsight.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.330
Jesus.

25:31.430 --> 25:34.466
A fine mess here,
Randall.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.335
Randall:
You're a thief.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.370
( sighs )
Quite sure you're wrong.

25:38.470 --> 25:41.273
But the good news
is it's not too late
to repair the damage.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.576
I know what I heard.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.311
Randall, you were doped.

25:45.411 --> 25:47.079
You have no idea
what you heard.

25:52.218 --> 25:55.287
Say you're successful
in convincing our friends
out there

25:55.387 --> 25:57.523
to believe your story.

25:57.624 --> 26:01.360
I'm not sure you've given
proper consideration
to what happens next.

26:01.460 --> 26:04.063
Do you think
they'd just haul me up
in front of the crew,

26:04.163 --> 26:07.166
air your story,
and that's the end of it?

26:07.266 --> 26:08.968
No, Randall.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.304
I think you've forgotten
one very important detail.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.006
The money.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.776
That has to be considered,
does it not?

26:16.876 --> 26:19.311
If we go tell the crew now,
there's a very good chance

26:19.411 --> 26:22.649
they simply hang the cook
right along with the captain.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.784
If Randall's right,

26:24.884 --> 26:27.553
that would be the end
of the Urca hunt.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.989
Are you suggesting
we keep this secret?

26:30.089 --> 26:33.559
Lie to the crew?
Right along with Flint?

26:33.660 --> 26:35.561
He's suggesting
that acting hastily

26:35.662 --> 26:38.064
could come with
a very hefty price.

26:38.164 --> 26:42.068
Even if I was convinced,
there's still Randall
to contend with.

26:45.004 --> 26:48.374
Are you suggesting
there's some way to
guarantee his silence?

26:48.474 --> 26:50.877
I can think of one way.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.781
- They wouldn't.
- Wouldn't they?

26:54.881 --> 26:58.617
A one-legged halfwit
versus a chance
at a fortune?

26:58.718 --> 27:01.553
The odds are decidedly
not in your favor.

27:01.654 --> 27:04.957
Well, you were confused
or delirious.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.994
Take your pick,
but tell them now.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.996
Then even if they wanted
to go to the crew,

27:10.096 --> 27:12.264
they'd have lost
their chief witness.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.300
And no one has to die.

27:19.605 --> 27:22.775
- You're a thief.
- I'm a thief.
Right.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.712
Well, good luck, Randall.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.815
It was nice knowing you.

27:28.915 --> 27:32.685
Albinus:
For as long as you
sail with him,

27:32.785 --> 27:35.487
his orders are my orders.

27:35.587 --> 27:38.858
And when your work is done,
this place will have you back.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.261
They'll serve you well.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.308
Is something wrong?

28:12.291 --> 28:14.326
You were one of ours.

28:16.595 --> 28:18.931
You were just a boy
yourself.

28:25.171 --> 28:28.007
Could not have been easy
coming back here.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.210
Must have taken
great strength.

28:32.745 --> 28:35.081
Go on.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.916
Take these men.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.452
Make me rich.

28:59.638 --> 29:03.509
You don't know me,
but you once did...

29:04.777 --> 29:07.213
when I was
the lowest among you.

29:09.615 --> 29:12.718
Now I've returned.

29:12.819 --> 29:16.288
And I offer you a chance
to be free of this place.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.126
I'm Charles Vane.

29:22.228 --> 29:25.731
And you were
a strong crew once,

29:25.832 --> 29:27.699
proper pirates.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.902
Feared, as you
should have been,

29:30.002 --> 29:32.571
before he dragged you
away from the sea,

29:32.671 --> 29:36.843
before he convinced you
to live here like animals.

29:36.943 --> 29:39.645
Because it suits
his weaknesses.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.213
There is a place
not far from here

29:41.313 --> 29:45.852
where strong men live
lives of pleasure, not labor,

29:45.952 --> 29:47.486
a place where you

29:47.586 --> 29:51.257
could be feared and respected
once again.

29:51.357 --> 29:55.294
Follow me,
and I will show you
what life is.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.457
( panting )

30:25.557 --> 30:28.928
Are you done?
Are you done?

30:31.663 --> 30:32.965
Oh!

30:41.908 --> 30:43.575
( grunts )

30:53.685 --> 30:54.620
( groans )

31:09.501 --> 31:11.370
I'm proud of you.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.520
Randall.

31:30.822 --> 31:34.126
I need a word
with Mr. Silver alone.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.101
- ( laughs )
- What's so funny?

31:42.201 --> 31:44.670
Just that I warned
Randall something
like this was coming.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.338
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

31:46.438 --> 31:50.376
Mr. De Groot's inclined
to hand you over to the crew.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.544
He's given me
exactly five minutes,

31:52.644 --> 31:56.082
at which point he intends
to call council so Randall
can share his story,

31:56.182 --> 31:58.617
after which
our hands are clean

31:58.717 --> 32:03.155
and you are most likely,
well, dead.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.994
What's that?

32:08.094 --> 32:09.962
A page from one
of Dr. Howell's manuals

32:10.062 --> 32:12.531
and your last chance at living
to see the sun rise again.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.236
You have exactly five minutes
to commit it to memory,

32:17.336 --> 32:20.339
after which you
will reproduce this page
to the best of your ability.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.808
If you can do so
to Mr. De Groot's
satisfaction,

32:22.908 --> 32:26.445
then maybe-- just maybe
he can be convinced

32:26.545 --> 32:29.548
to keep your secret
for the sake of the Urca haul.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.450
- It's a test?
- Exactly.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.053
- It's a terrible test.
- Believe me, I'm aware.

32:35.487 --> 32:38.157
If I was the thief,
which I am by no means
admitting,

32:38.257 --> 32:40.192
I could have
read that schedule
a hundred times over

32:40.292 --> 32:41.960
before I was forced
to destroy it.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.929
Whether or not I can
memorize this page

32:44.030 --> 32:45.497
in five minutes
proves nothing.

32:45.597 --> 32:48.834
Mr. De Groot
doesn't believe
that he can trust

32:48.934 --> 32:50.802
the information
inside your head,

32:50.902 --> 32:52.504
certainly not enough
to risk his own life,

32:52.604 --> 32:56.642
not to mention
committing poor Randall
to an early grave.

32:56.742 --> 33:01.047
He says if he's
to go down that road,
he needs certainty.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.149
It's the best I could do.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.085
Four minutes.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.324
( sighs )

33:14.593 --> 33:16.462
( rooster crows )

33:16.562 --> 33:18.364
Wait.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.602
Compliments
of the new consortium.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.507
A dead cargo
is a worthless cargo.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.811
Eme:
Did you ask her?

33:32.911 --> 33:36.182
I implored Miss Guthrie
to facilitate your release.

33:36.282 --> 33:39.585
I told her she would not
have her guns without yours
and the others' help.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.253
What did she say?

33:42.654 --> 33:46.558
She said she would
take it under advisement.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.394
( sighs )

33:49.828 --> 33:53.165
I warned you this place
would not be any different.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.271
But do not give up hope.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.681
I'll need to know
your secret.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.518
To putting up with her.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.290
My decision whether or not
to partake in this consortium

34:18.389 --> 34:20.126
was predicated
on her agreement

34:20.226 --> 34:23.129
to lift the ban
on Charles Vane's crew.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.031
I understand she did.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.065
Begrudgingly.

34:28.167 --> 34:32.237
And shortly after,
all eight disappeared.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.639
Left for Port Royal,
I am told.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.443
And you think Eleanor had
something to do with this?

34:37.543 --> 34:38.944
It doesn't matter
either way.

34:39.043 --> 34:41.612
Short of my retrieving
eight corpses from
her armoire,

34:41.713 --> 34:43.482
nothing would dissuade
the other captains

34:43.581 --> 34:46.618
from the course
that she's set now.

34:46.717 --> 34:50.021
Which I'd wager she knew
would be the case.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.424
I'd wager you're right.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.127
I asked you once
to get her under control.

34:56.562 --> 34:59.865
The truth is there is
no controlling her, is there?

35:05.537 --> 35:07.706
You forced her hand
in front of men

35:07.806 --> 35:09.475
whose respect she demands

35:09.575 --> 35:13.044
in order to run
this business.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.314
Really, Captain,

35:15.414 --> 35:17.416
what choice
did you give her?

35:24.923 --> 35:26.958
( hoofbeats approaching )

35:27.058 --> 35:29.361
- ( dog barking )
- ( horse neighs )

35:37.569 --> 35:40.172
Miranda:
Mr. Guthrie isn't here.

35:43.742 --> 35:46.812
He's taken sanctuary
on Mr. Underhill's estate.

35:55.287 --> 35:56.922
Do you know
what you've done?

35:58.690 --> 36:01.827
What madness possessed you
to write that letter?

36:01.927 --> 36:03.295
I tried to tell you.

36:03.395 --> 36:06.398
Billy found it.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.734
If he'd have shown anyone
before I discovered him,

36:08.834 --> 36:11.169
but for dumb luck,

36:11.270 --> 36:12.771
I'd be dead.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.473
I'm sorry.

36:14.573 --> 36:18.176
You know I would
never intentionally put you
in any kind of danger.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.178
What was your intent?

36:20.279 --> 36:22.681
What was it?

36:22.781 --> 36:26.352
To destroy everything
we've tried to build here
for the past 10 years?

36:26.452 --> 36:28.587
Or was it just
to embarrass me?

36:28.687 --> 36:31.156
To show you a way out
of all this, to free you.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.991
A way out?

36:33.091 --> 36:35.827
Have you no memory
of how we got here?

36:35.927 --> 36:37.763
What they took from us?

36:40.332 --> 36:42.968
What does it matter now?

36:43.068 --> 36:45.704
What does it matter?

36:45.804 --> 36:47.973
What does it matter
what happened then

36:48.073 --> 36:50.242
if we have no life now?

36:50.342 --> 36:51.810
Because there is
no life here.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.879
There is no joy here.
There is no love here.

36:53.979 --> 36:57.148
- There's no love here.
- What are you talking about?!

36:57.249 --> 36:59.585
What do you think
I'm out there fighting for

36:59.685 --> 37:02.354
if not to make
all those things
possible here?

37:02.454 --> 37:04.523
You'll fight a war
so we can make a life?

37:04.623 --> 37:06.392
You don't get one
without the other,
my sweet.

37:06.492 --> 37:09.495
No.
You're wrong.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.333
I sent that letter
to show you that you're wrong.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.504
There is a life in Boston.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.808
There is joy there
and music

37:22.908 --> 37:24.743
and peace.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.145
The door is open.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.747
I've opened it for you.

37:28.847 --> 37:32.484
And it requires
no war and no blood
and no sacrifice.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.453
It requires
an intolerable sacrifice.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.288
To accept a pardon?

37:36.388 --> 37:38.524
To apologize.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.892
Apologize?
Who will you be
apologizing to?

37:40.992 --> 37:42.528
To England!

37:45.431 --> 37:48.534
They took
everything from us.

37:48.634 --> 37:52.704
And then they
called me a monster.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.840
The moment I sign
that pardon,

37:54.940 --> 37:57.509
the moment
I ask for one,

37:57.609 --> 38:00.646
I proclaim to the world
that they were right.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.382
This ends

38:03.482 --> 38:07.052
when I grant them
my forgiveness...

38:08.387 --> 38:10.021
not the other way around.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.592
This path you're on...

38:14.793 --> 38:17.363
it doesn't lead
where you think it does.

38:19.498 --> 38:22.901
If he were here,
he'd agree with me.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.716
Three days with
the Urca's schedule,

38:37.816 --> 38:40.819
three minutes with
whatever the fuck this is.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.422
I'll remind them.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.425
Before you go,
just one question.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.660
Harebrained
as this test was,

38:48.760 --> 38:50.295
you had to be
quite certain

38:50.396 --> 38:52.531
I was the thief
to even think of it.

38:52.631 --> 38:55.133
And I don't believe you have
near that kind of faith

38:55.233 --> 38:57.403
in our friend Randall here.

38:57.503 --> 39:00.572
Who told you about me?

39:00.672 --> 39:02.408
Billy?

39:08.113 --> 39:10.215
Randall,
we need to talk.

39:10.315 --> 39:13.351
- You're a thief.
- Randall, pay attention.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.787
Right now at this moment,
it is just as likely

39:15.887 --> 39:18.757
you're the one
that dies as I am.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.893
What if there was
a way neither of us
had to die today?

39:21.993 --> 39:26.331
I go to the crew
and I offer to be
your caretaker.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.066
I'll promise to look
after you day and night

39:28.166 --> 39:30.436
and give
my personal guarantee
should anything happen,

39:30.536 --> 39:32.370
it comes out of my share.

39:32.471 --> 39:35.140
I think I could persuade
the crew to accept that.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.775
And then you're back
on the ship.

39:36.875 --> 39:41.012
All you have to do
is change your story.

39:42.514 --> 39:43.715
You're a thief.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.751
Are you fucking
kidding me?!

39:46.985 --> 39:49.020
( sighs )
All right.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.491
Yes, I'm a thief.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.360
I took the page
and I shouldn't have.

39:55.461 --> 39:57.395
I should have
counted my blessings

39:57.496 --> 39:59.465
to be let off
that merchant ship.

39:59.565 --> 40:00.866
But what can I say,
Randall?

40:00.966 --> 40:04.335
I'm not a joiner.
I never have been.

40:04.436 --> 40:07.606
But I'm willing
to do it now.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.040
So pull your head
from your ass

40:09.140 --> 40:11.777
and let's both live
to fight another day.

40:13.311 --> 40:15.614
Dufresne:
Sorry, Mr. Silver.

40:22.888 --> 40:25.924
- You're a thief.
- Yes, we understand.

40:29.327 --> 40:30.862
Randall?

40:30.962 --> 40:33.331
You're a thief.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.901
Randall, what's gotten
into you?

40:37.168 --> 40:39.404
You're a thief.

40:39.505 --> 40:42.273
What the hell
is going on here?

40:42.373 --> 40:44.543
It would appear
Mr. Randall

40:44.643 --> 40:47.479
has reconsidered
his position.

40:47.579 --> 40:50.716
If you intend to accuse
Mr. Silver before the crew,

40:50.816 --> 40:52.684
you do so
without a witness.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.225
( knocks )

41:00.325 --> 41:02.460
( door opens )

41:04.630 --> 41:05.964
Give us the room,
please.

41:11.937 --> 41:15.340
As you can imagine,
money is tight right now.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.476
The Walrus crew
are unwilling to manumit
a hold full of slaves,

41:18.577 --> 41:21.146
nor do I have
the funds to purchase
their release outright.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.585
So here's what I've done.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.854
The able-bodied males
will be taken

41:28.954 --> 41:30.822
onto the Black Hind
under Captain Lawrence

41:30.922 --> 41:32.758
to fill a recent rash
of desertions.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.860
The consortium
has reached an agreement

41:34.960 --> 41:36.662
with Mr. Dufresne
of the Walrus

41:36.762 --> 41:39.497
to trade future
subsidies and credits
to cover the cost.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.736
Six women remain
thereafter,

41:44.836 --> 41:46.471
for whom I was able
to scrounge together

41:46.572 --> 41:49.340
enough money
to cover their cost.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.110
They'll be offered a wage
in my employ.

41:53.979 --> 41:56.047
Thank you.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.217
- As for us--
- Eleanor, I--

41:59.317 --> 42:01.052
I know how much
you worry about me.

42:01.152 --> 42:03.221
But I hope the events
of the last few days

42:03.321 --> 42:04.890
prove that I can
handle myself.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.160
It does.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.496
I'm not blind to Flint.

42:11.597 --> 42:14.199
I know he keeps
things from me.

42:14.299 --> 42:16.201
But there's no reason
for you to feel threatened

42:16.301 --> 42:18.136
by my partnership
with him.

42:18.236 --> 42:20.371
If you're to stay
with me, I need to know
that I can trust you.

42:20.471 --> 42:23.341
Eleanor, Captain Hornigold
has extended me

42:23.441 --> 42:25.010
an offer to join his crew.

42:29.581 --> 42:31.917
And you've accepted?

42:35.987 --> 42:38.924
If you need me,
I will be here for you.

42:41.492 --> 42:45.664
But as long as you insist
on pursuing this course
with Captain Flint,

42:45.764 --> 42:48.934
I will always be tempted
to interfere.

42:49.034 --> 42:50.902
Please get out.

43:00.979 --> 43:02.914
( moaning )

43:03.014 --> 43:05.050
I'm sorry, but the income
you've reported for
the past two days

43:05.150 --> 43:07.118
is simply too low
to be believed.

43:07.218 --> 43:10.255
I'm going to have to ask
you to vacate your room,
make way for someone else.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.625
Oh, yes, yes.

43:13.725 --> 43:15.060
Here it comes.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.962
( crying )

43:18.396 --> 43:20.265
Ugh.

43:20.365 --> 43:23.735
I'll have you know
I have slit men's throats
while they have wept,

43:23.835 --> 43:27.205
begging my forbearance,
and slept soundly
that very night.

43:27.305 --> 43:30.575
If you were hoping
to manipulate me, you are
barking up the wrong tree.

43:30.676 --> 43:33.378
( crying continues )

43:33.478 --> 43:35.847
The wrong tree.

43:38.349 --> 43:39.718
Jesus Christ.

43:39.818 --> 43:41.319
- Alice: Mr. Rackham.
- What?

43:41.419 --> 43:42.954
- Five pieces.
- ( coins clink )

43:44.389 --> 43:46.524
Oh, look who's
up and about.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.259
Who did you just service?

43:49.427 --> 43:50.428
What's that?

43:50.528 --> 43:53.364
Who paid you
those coins?

43:53.464 --> 43:56.167
It was Captain Hallindale
I saw leaving your room,
was it not?

43:56.267 --> 43:59.137
A man whose sole desire
is to be swaddled in canvas

43:59.237 --> 44:01.807
while he sucks
on a fat, milkless breast

44:01.907 --> 44:03.909
like a nursing child.

44:04.009 --> 44:05.777
And the price we have
always charged for mothering

44:05.877 --> 44:08.613
is 20 pieces, not five.

44:08.714 --> 44:11.683
Who the fuck do you think
you're accusing?

44:11.783 --> 44:13.752
A handjob pays five.

44:13.852 --> 44:16.788
All Captain Hallindale
had time for today was a tug.

44:18.423 --> 44:21.459
Will your story hold
when I ask him
to confirm it?

44:21.559 --> 44:23.829
Or will you confess
your crime now

44:23.929 --> 44:26.364
and pray that
our new patron
is more forgiving

44:26.464 --> 44:28.199
than Mr. Noonan
would have been?

44:31.602 --> 44:35.006
I swear on
the body and blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ

44:35.106 --> 44:36.742
this will never
happen again.

44:36.842 --> 44:39.444
For your sake,
it had better not.

44:45.951 --> 44:48.619
In my experience, if you
do not discipline a whore,

44:48.720 --> 44:50.789
she will always
take advantage.

44:54.225 --> 44:56.762
Get your fucking house
in order.

45:11.743 --> 45:13.779
Hmm?

45:43.942 --> 45:45.576
I thought you were
going to report back

45:45.676 --> 45:47.946
once you returned
from Mrs. Barlow's.

45:56.121 --> 45:58.189
Do you really think
it's wise to get pissed

45:58.289 --> 46:00.926
in full view
of any of your men
that may stumble in here

46:01.026 --> 46:02.660
just before
they're about to embark

46:02.760 --> 46:04.395
on the most dangerous
journey of their lives?

46:07.465 --> 46:10.135
Wise?

46:10.235 --> 46:12.503
Probably not.

46:13.872 --> 46:17.075
But then there was
36 hours before castoff,

46:17.175 --> 46:19.044
so I thought

46:19.144 --> 46:21.146
why not live dangerously?

46:22.647 --> 46:25.283
36 hours
is plenty of time

46:25.383 --> 46:28.186
for them to find reason
to doubt you.

46:30.922 --> 46:33.959
Perhaps a little doubt
in me is called for.

46:42.700 --> 46:44.569
What happened out there?

46:51.242 --> 46:54.145
Tell me

46:54.245 --> 46:56.982
we're not crazy,
you and I.

46:58.516 --> 47:00.385
Crazy?

47:03.688 --> 47:07.158
To put ourselves
through all this

47:07.258 --> 47:10.195
when the outcome's
so uncertain.

47:13.331 --> 47:16.301
The outcome is only uncertain
for those who disbelieve.

47:19.404 --> 47:21.940
I believe in this place.

47:23.674 --> 47:26.144
And I believe if there's
anyone who can do
what's necessary

47:26.244 --> 47:28.246
to make it
something better,

47:28.346 --> 47:30.148
it's you.

48:08.486 --> 48:10.555
( men shouting )

48:12.857 --> 48:15.393
( grunting )

48:15.493 --> 48:17.963
( chickens clucking )

48:20.065 --> 48:23.001
Oi, where are you going?

48:23.101 --> 48:24.669
Eyes on Randall
at all times--

48:24.769 --> 48:26.204
wasn't that the deal?

48:31.476 --> 48:33.178
( chuckles )

48:35.380 --> 48:38.149
Randall, you are
a fucking puzzle.

48:38.249 --> 48:41.219
Part of me thinks
you must be the luckiest
halfwit in the colonies,

48:41.319 --> 48:43.088
the way this all
played out.

48:45.323 --> 48:48.693
But part of me suspects
there's something else
going on here.

48:50.661 --> 48:53.631
I'm forced to wonder
if you didn't orchestrate
this whole little drama

48:53.731 --> 48:57.935
knowing it would corner me
into securing your return
to the crew.

48:59.904 --> 49:01.372
I'm forced to consider
the possibility

49:01.472 --> 49:03.274
there is a lot more
of the old Randall

49:03.374 --> 49:05.710
in that head of yours
than you'd like to let on.

49:08.413 --> 49:10.781
That you're
no halfwit at all,

49:10.881 --> 49:13.384
but a very shrewd
operator

49:13.484 --> 49:15.120
who's managed
to gain the benefits

49:15.220 --> 49:18.356
of sailing with these men
while avoiding all the risk.

49:20.358 --> 49:22.827
That perhaps,

49:22.927 --> 49:25.463
just perhaps,

49:25.563 --> 49:28.099
you're a goddamn genius.

49:31.936 --> 49:34.339
( farts )

49:46.517 --> 49:48.353
( men shouting )

50:11.176 --> 50:13.544
( chatter and laughter )

50:13.644 --> 50:16.181
Mr. Gates.

50:16.281 --> 50:18.183
Mr. Quartermaster.

50:23.288 --> 50:24.922
The crew seem
in good spirit.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.692
All things considered.

50:32.063 --> 50:34.932
What about
our friend the cook?

50:35.032 --> 50:38.269
It appears to be
resolved for now.

50:39.437 --> 50:41.372
Though I must tell you,
he discerned that I knew

50:41.472 --> 50:43.308
about the missing page
beforehand.

50:43.408 --> 50:46.311
He assumed
Billy told me.

50:46.411 --> 50:48.012
I can see how he might
think that.

50:48.113 --> 50:50.415
I did nothing
to dispel that notion,

50:50.515 --> 50:52.617
though it may not take him
a long time to realize

50:52.717 --> 50:55.586
who it was that actually
brought me into this.

50:55.686 --> 50:58.789
Well, we'll have to deal
with our situation

50:58.889 --> 51:00.758
as it develops,

51:00.858 --> 51:02.727
won't we?

51:02.827 --> 51:03.761
Aye.

51:08.233 --> 51:10.235
There's something else.

51:10.335 --> 51:12.837
It's Messrs. Howell
and De Groot.

51:12.937 --> 51:14.505
Give them
a couple of days.

51:14.605 --> 51:17.708
Once we're at sea,
the work will take
their focus off Randall.

51:19.810 --> 51:23.914
Actually, it's not Randall
that's troubling them.

51:24.014 --> 51:25.650
It's you.

51:27.017 --> 51:29.053
Having had some time
to think about it,

51:29.154 --> 51:32.757
they're not certain
that you're up to doing
what's necessary.

51:34.859 --> 51:37.862
The lying
we could forgive.

51:37.962 --> 51:39.297
Singleton we could forgive.

51:39.397 --> 51:41.832
We could forgive
all of it.

51:43.668 --> 51:45.470
But not Billy.

51:47.738 --> 51:50.308
That requires an answer.

51:52.477 --> 51:54.111
When the time comes,
we need to know

51:54.212 --> 51:56.481
that you won't stand
in the way.

51:59.016 --> 52:00.985
I understand
he's your friend.

52:01.085 --> 52:03.888
But once we have
the money,

52:03.988 --> 52:05.623
Flint dies.

52:07.225 --> 52:09.294
No argument.

52:13.831 --> 52:15.766
Not from me.

53:20.331 --> 53:23.434
( rustling )

53:36.547 --> 53:39.116
- Eleanor's voice:
You could be strong again.
- ( gasps )

53:39.216 --> 53:40.985
You could resist me.

53:43.020 --> 53:46.624
You could take this whole
fucking island from me

53:46.724 --> 53:50.395
if only you weren't
so goddamned afraid.

54:15.486 --> 54:17.488
( chatter and laughter )

54:23.127 --> 54:25.195
- ( squelches )
- ( groans )

54:25.296 --> 54:26.597
( chatter stops )

54:32.102 --> 54:33.771
( grunts )

55:07.905 --> 55:10.875
( instrumental music
playing )
