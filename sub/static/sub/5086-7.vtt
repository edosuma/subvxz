WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:06.267
Okay, let's move it!

00:06.300 --> 00:08.433
This is ridiculous.
Don't you know who I am?

00:08.467 --> 00:10.667
You're a citizen in custody,
that's all that matters

00:10.700 --> 00:12.800
right now, have a seat.

00:12.833 --> 00:15.567
Officer Gutierrez.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.567
I didn't do anything wrong!

00:17.600 --> 00:19.133
When do I get my phone call?

00:19.167 --> 00:21.467
You're gonna pull me over
for a little traffic stop, then

00:21.500 --> 00:23.833
all of a sudden I get thrown
against the hood of a car?

00:23.867 --> 00:24.900
What up?

00:24.933 --> 00:26.433
Attitude
a traffic s

00:26.467 --> 00:28.100
More energi
than a cup of coffe

00:28.133 --> 00:29.567
Why are you
pulling people over?

00:29.600 --> 00:31.667
I was at the cor
of 7th and Cypre

00:31.700 --> 00:33.533
I see Hector w
Miss Track S

00:33.567 --> 00:35.600
and she's up in his face
screaming and hollering

00:35.633 --> 00:37.733
so I pull over to see i
they need some hel

00:37.767 --> 00:39.000
and she st
laying into

00:39.033 --> 00:40.967
She started swingi
and kicking

00:41.000 --> 00:43.933
I'm lucky I got the cuff
on before she broke my leg.

00:43.967 --> 00:45.733
I'm going to h
such a

00:45.767 --> 00:47.633
But you took her down.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.633
Guess what guys? You are
going to regret the day

00:49.667 --> 00:51.833
you dragged me in here,
I swear!

00:51.867 --> 00:54.600
Maybe you should try
out for the team.

00:54.633 --> 00:56.000
What tea

00:56.033 --> 00:58.167
You just arrested
Chelsea Boyd,

00:58.200 --> 01:01.867
the star player of the
Seattle Scorpios soccer team.

01:01.900 --> 01:04.067
Do you think that's
acceptable?

01:04.100 --> 01:06.833
Have you ever seen me play?
Have you?

01:06.867 --> 01:08.500
Their training facility
is here in Crestview.

01:08.533 --> 01:09.833
I don't follow the sport

01:09.867 --> 01:12.733
How could you miss
all the marketing?

01:12.767 --> 01:14.800
She's Seattle's
Sweetheart.

01:14.833 --> 01:17.600
Do you know how much I make a
game? Do you have any idea?

01:17.633 --> 01:20.800
Really

01:20.833 --> 01:24.133
You have no idea what you've
done! You're gonna pay for this!

01:24.167 --> 01:25.600
Wow!

01:25.633 --> 01:29.967
She's lo

01:30.067 --> 01:31.933
Did you administer a
field sobriety test?

01:31.967 --> 01:33.767
There w
indication, ma'

01:33.800 --> 01:35.700
I pulled her o
for running a r

01:35.733 --> 01:38.167
As I approached, she
already exited her vehicle.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.167
I asked he
return to her vehicl

01:40.200 --> 01:43.500
but she was belligeren
and non-complia

01:43.533 --> 01:46.167
That's when Detecti
McLean arri

01:46.200 --> 01:48.767
Take me through the steps.
Be precise.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.067
Why all the scrutiny?

01:50.067 --> 01:51.633
Chelsea Boyd is a
local celebrity;

01:51.667 --> 01:54.700
we have the potential
for a lot of attention.

01:54.733 --> 02:01.133
I need to be sure my people did
everything 100% by the book.

02:01.167 --> 02:05.633
Okay, driver's car is here.
Patrol car is here.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.067
I am in traffic here.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.100
I see Gutierrez in
potential difficulty,

02:09.133 --> 02:12.600
so I pull over here.
I exit the vehicle;

02:12.633 --> 02:15.167
ask Gutierrez if he needs
assistance. He asks me to

02:15.200 --> 02:17.933
get the driver back to her
vehicle while he runs her ID.

02:17.967 --> 02:20.267
I return t
car, I punch in the ID

02:20.300 --> 02:22.900
I hear escalated voices -

02:22.933 --> 02:24.600
If you don't return
to your vehicle,

02:24.633 --> 02:26.733
I will place you
under arrest.

02:26.767 --> 02:28.867
I'm not moving unle
you make me, so

02:28.900 --> 02:31.333
-- and look up to see
Detective McLean has the

02:31.367 --> 02:34.200
driver on the hood of her
car and handcuffing her.

02:34.233 --> 02:36.067
You have the right
to remain silent,

02:36.100 --> 02:38.100
you have the right
to an attorney...

02:38.133 --> 02:40.600
So you didn't observe
the actual detention?

02:40.633 --> 02:43.067
I was lo
at my compu

02:43.067 --> 02:45.733
What happened after Gutierrez
left you alone with the driver?

02:45.767 --> 02:47.800
I instruct the driver to
return to her vehicle.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.700
Ma'am, I need you to
return to your vehicle.

02:49.733 --> 02:51.767
She replies that I can't
tell her what to do.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.233
You can't
me what to

02:53.267 --> 02:56.867
I explain that failure to
comply is grounds for arrest.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.567
If you don't return
to your vehicle,

02:58.600 --> 03:00.167
I will place you
under arrest.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.800
She plants herself and
says the only way

03:01.833 --> 03:04.333
she's going to comply
is if I make her.

03:04.367 --> 03:06.367
I'm not moving unt
you make me, so

03:06.400 --> 03:08.700
I explain that I am
prepared to do that and,

03:08.733 --> 03:11.300
as an officer of the law,
I am empowered to do so.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.700
As a police officer I
am prepared to do that.

03:13.733 --> 03:14.867
And that's when
you arrested Boyd?

03:14.900 --> 03:17.600
No, that's when Boyd
kicked me in the shin.

03:17.633 --> 03:20.933
Ow! Hey, that was not okay.

03:20.967 --> 03:24.600
My compliments to the Seattle
Scorpios, she's got a good kick.

03:24.633 --> 03:26.800
She continued to
try to strike me.

03:26.833 --> 03:28.267
Get away from

03:28.300 --> 03:30.067
I then was able to
restrain her arms,

03:31.667 --> 03:33.633
push her onto
the hood of my car,

03:33.667 --> 03:35.100
Ow!

03:35.133 --> 03:36.900
and apply handcuffs.

03:36.933 --> 03:40.067
You are goin
pay for

03:40.067 --> 03:42.700
By the book.
As I was certain it would be.

03:42.733 --> 03:44.567
Write it up exactly
as it happened.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.067
Yes, ma'am.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.367
Ms. Boyd will remain in custody
until we can schedule her

03:48.400 --> 03:50.300
arraignment, probably
tomorrow morning.

03:50.333 --> 03:54.400
That's going to
make her so happy.

03:57.167 --> 04:02.200
Thanks Chi

04:02.233 --> 04:03.900
That Chris has got
a real nice car.

04:03.933 --> 04:05.333
Y

04:05.367 --> 04:09.067
Which part of don't hang out
with him did I not make clear?

04:09.067 --> 04:12.333
Chris came to see some people
and he offered me a ride

04:12.367 --> 04:13.967
We weren't hanging out

04:14.067 --> 04:16.733
That kid's got a bad habit
of being where he's not

04:16.767 --> 04:18.867
supposed to be. It's
time for you to move on.

04:18.900 --> 04:20.400
So I can't
him at

04:20.433 --> 04:30.467
That's a really good idea.
We should try that.

04:30.467 --> 04:40.800
That's a really good idea.
We should try that.

04:40.833 --> 04:41.833
Can I help

04:41.867 --> 04:43.700
Lieutenant Wilkes, please.

04:43.733 --> 04:45.700
I don't think sh
available right no

04:45.733 --> 04:47.667
She can make herself
available for the owner

04:47.700 --> 04:50.900
of the Seattle Scorpios.

04:50.933 --> 04:52.367
Mr. We

04:52.400 --> 04:55.400
Lieutenant Wilkes. You have
one of my players in custody.

04:55.433 --> 04:57.767
I need to know when
she'll be out of custody.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.067
That's up to
arraignment jud

04:59.100 --> 05:01.333
You are aware we have a
playoff game this weekend?

05:01.367 --> 05:03.933
Yes, and congratulation
on a winning seaso

05:03.967 --> 05:05.700
Chelsea Boyd is the
anchor of our lineup.

05:05.733 --> 05:07.333
She has to be on the field.

05:07.367 --> 05:09.933
Perhaps Ms. Boyd should have
considered that before running

05:09.967 --> 05:12.267
a red light
resisting arre

05:12.300 --> 05:14.433
Do you know where that
terrific girl was coming from

05:14.467 --> 05:17.500
before your people pulled her
over? A charity breakfast.

05:17.533 --> 05:19.133
Hardly the kind of
girl who'd give

05:19.167 --> 05:21.533
Crestview's finest
a hard time.

05:21.567 --> 05:22.933
I'm as surpr
as you

05:22.967 --> 05:24.767
When Chelsea called,
she told me

05:24.800 --> 05:26.533
the detective used
excessive force.

05:26.567 --> 05:29.067
Given the level of M
Boyd's resistance, I believe

05:29.067 --> 05:31.933
my people respon
appropriately. The individuals

05:31.967 --> 05:34.500
involved are among t
finest in this department

05:34.533 --> 05:39.467
They ha
trust and suppo

05:39.500 --> 05:41.400
Detective Hernan
will see you o

05:41.433 --> 05:43.100
It's horrifying that our
players aren't safe

05:43.133 --> 05:44.200
in their own community.

05:44.233 --> 05:45.933
It's an outr

05:45.967 --> 05:57.967
The police are out of control.
We have to respond.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.700
he elephant may fan out hisT
ars in an attempt to appeare

06:00.733 --> 06:03.600
larger as he attempts to
ominate the attacking animal.d

06:03.633 --> 06:06.067
This can be accompanied
by jerks of the head,

06:06.100 --> 06:12.533
in an up-and-down motion...

06:12.567 --> 06:14.100
What's this?

06:14.133 --> 06:16.833
I don't know. Chris just told
me to give it to you.

06:16.867 --> 06:17.900
Chris?

06:17.933 --> 06:19.100
Yup.

06:19.133 --> 06:21.333
The guy who made me do
a shot and got us

06:21.367 --> 06:22.467
in trouble for life?

06:22.500 --> 06:29.467
Yeah.
That's Chris.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.400
Where's the remote?
Change it to channel six.

06:32.433 --> 06:36.200
Channel six!

06:36.233 --> 06:38.333
I was watching that.

06:38.367 --> 06:41.267
This video clearly shows
Crestview Police detective

06:41.300 --> 06:46.400
llison McLean using excessiveA
force as she arrests

06:46.433 --> 06:49.900
Seattle Scorpios star
Chelsea Boyd this morning.

06:49.933 --> 06:51.567
Mom?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.700
At the start of the arrest,
Chelsea Boyd seems to show

06:53.733 --> 06:59.067
no signs of putting up
any resistance...

06:59.067 --> 07:01.200
Some are calling this an
alarming display of police

07:01.233 --> 07:04.933
rutality, and this shockingb
video would seem

07:04.967 --> 07:10.200
to verify those
allegations.

07:10.233 --> 07:12.067
That's not when
the arrest started.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.200
Hector?

07:13.233 --> 07:14.933
I actually didn't see..

07:14.967 --> 07:17.600
But you know
what went down.

07:17.633 --> 07:24.067
However it went down, that
video makes you look bad.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.967
The video doesn't
tell the whole story.

07:26.067 --> 07:27.367
It's the only
one that's out.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.600
We need to find who shot
the video and make sure

07:29.633 --> 07:31.600
they testify to the
full chain of events.

07:31.633 --> 07:34.067
Devin and Victoria are
already working on that.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.867
Victoria?

07:35.900 --> 07:37.133
You know the drill.

07:37.167 --> 07:39.400
You need to step back
while the Use of Force team

07:39.433 --> 07:41.067
determines if your
actions were warranted.

07:41.067 --> 07:42.133
They were warranted.

07:42.167 --> 07:44.067
I'm sure they were.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.333
But, for the moment,
we're releasing Boyd.

07:46.367 --> 07:50.167
And, in keeping with
procedure, you're suspended.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.433
For doing my job?

07:51.467 --> 07:59.133
No special treatment,
even for my best detective.

07:59.167 --> 08:09.267
Yes, ma'am.

08:09.267 --> 08:24.233
Yes, ma'am.

08:24.267 --> 08:26.433
So, I'm goin
be home for a b

08:26.467 --> 08:28.600
not too long, just until the
news coverage dies down and

08:28.633 --> 08:31.933
this whole t
gets sorted

08:31.967 --> 08:33.433
Are you getting fired?

08:33.467 --> 08:37.400
No, there's just a procedure
that needs to be followed.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.767
Are you always so aggressive
when you arrest someone?

08:40.800 --> 08:42.967
Privileges of having power.

08:47.300 --> 08:50.933
I didn't abuse my position.
I used appropriate force

08:50.967 --> 08:52.333
But you can't go to work?

08:52.367 --> 08:54.500
Guys. This is so that you
know what's going on,

08:54.533 --> 08:57.067
not so you can grill Mom.

08:57.067 --> 09:00.400
The good news is, I'm going
to be home, so I can pick

09:00.433 --> 09:03.633
you guys up from school, help
with homework, give Dad a break,

09:03.667 --> 09:11.367
you kn
all that fun stu

09:11.400 --> 09:21.433
It'll be gr

09:21.433 --> 09:27.167
It'll be gr

09:27.200 --> 09:31.133
Than
Excu

09:31.167 --> 09:33.500
I'm not going to tell yo
who gave me that video.

09:33.533 --> 09:35.433
That would be
revealing my sourc

09:35.467 --> 09:38.133
Ms. Preston, that source could
have been present at the scene

09:38.167 --> 09:40.567
of Chelsea Boyd's arrest and
could know what occurred prior

09:40.600 --> 09:42.200
to the events in the video.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.500
We need to
what happen

09:43.533 --> 09:45.567
to see if we can
exonerate our colleague

09:45.600 --> 09:46.500
She'll be exonerated.

09:46.533 --> 09:49.100
Of c

09:49.133 --> 09:53.067
Detectives, as a reporter, if
I even hint at the identity of

09:53.100 --> 09:55.433
someone who gave me
confidential information,

09:55.467 --> 09:57.433
no one would ever
speak to me again.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.333
But you have no problem
watching a police officer

09:59.367 --> 10:00.900
punished for
false allegations?

10:00.933 --> 10:02.333
I'm not judging
true or false.

10:02.367 --> 10:05.533
All I care about is a good
story. And Cop vs. Soccer Player

10:05.567 --> 10:07.067
is a great one.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.100
We just need a name.

10:09.133 --> 10:19.167
You're not
getting it from me.

10:19.167 --> 10:39.167
You're not
getting it from me.

10:39.167 --> 10:59.167
You're not
getting it from me.

10:59.167 --> 11:19.233
You're not
getting it from me.

11:19.233 --> 11:38.667
You're not
getting it from me.

11:38.700 --> 11:42.100
Miss Baker, You were at the
charity event with Chelsea

11:42.133 --> 11:43.400
the morning she was arrested?

11:43.433 --> 11:44.533
Yeah, a bunch of us were

11:44.567 --> 11:46.467
Did you take the
same way home she did,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.067
see anything along the way?

11:48.067 --> 11:50.267
No, and I doubt the
would have been much to see.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.567
Chelsea is a kind a
wonderful person who's to

11:52.600 --> 11:58.733
much of a team player t
ever get into any trouble

11:58.767 --> 12:01.600
I live in the opposite direction
of where Chelsea was roughed up.

12:01.633 --> 12:05.067
That's a mischaracterization.
Chelsea resisted arrest.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.700
That's not what I
saw on the video.

12:06.733 --> 12:08.967
Which is why we're looking
for the person who shot it.

12:09.067 --> 12:10.567
Sure wasn't me.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.133
Chelsea is a kind and
wonderful person who's too

12:13.167 --> 12:17.733
much of a team player to
ever get into any trouble.

12:17.767 --> 12:21.367
Did you leave the charity
event before or after Chelsea?

12:21.400 --> 12:24.367
Pretty sure we all got out of
there around the same time.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.567
Which wa
you take h

12:25.600 --> 12:28.067
The shortest distance
from that place to mine.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.067
I had to get
home to feed my dogs.

12:30.067 --> 12:31.767
Look, I really wish I
could help you, but...

12:31.800 --> 12:33.367
If you think of
anything, or hear anything,

12:33.400 --> 12:34.767
we need you to let us know.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.700
I will, but I can't
believe that something

12:36.733 --> 12:38.633
like this could
happen to Chelsea.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.500
She's a kind and
wonderful person who's--

12:40.533 --> 12:43.567
--too much of a team player
to ever get into any trouble.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.500
We

12:45.533 --> 12:49.233
Yeah. Someone like Chels
shouldn't be told more than once

12:49.267 --> 12:53.067
to return to her vehicle. She
already knows better than that.

12:53.067 --> 12:56.467
Madison, on the field.

12:56.500 --> 13:06.600
Right behind you.

13:06.600 --> 13:11.667
Right behind you.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.333
Wow. Someone br
in and decorat

13:14.367 --> 13:16.433
Ha. I just did a little
straightening up,

13:16.467 --> 13:18.733
did things I haven't
had time to do.

13:18.767 --> 13:20.067
Wow, thanks, M

13:20.067 --> 13:21.300
Seriously?

13:21.333 --> 13:22.800
The first thing you do after
being suspended is--

13:22.833 --> 13:24.800
Work?
Yeah, some jobs never end.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.567
I guess I'll t
this upstairs th

13:26.600 --> 13:28.300
Oh, I cleaned your room, too.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.467
Guys, did you know you actually
have a floor under there?

13:30.500 --> 13:32.667
It's three strata
down, but it's there.

13:32.700 --> 13:41.333
So the rumors are true

13:41.367 --> 13:43.633
What's up?

13:43.667 --> 13:51.133
I was putting away laundry
and I found this.

13:51.167 --> 13:52.500
Care to explain?

13:52.533 --> 13:54.133
You were snoop
in my r

13:54.167 --> 13:55.767
No, I was just
putting away laundry.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.567
Who drew that and why
is he still thinking of you?

13:58.600 --> 13:59.733
He's just some g

13:59.767 --> 14:01.533
Do I know him?

14:01.567 --> 14:03.667
I can't believe you wer
going through my stuff

14:03.700 --> 14:06.700
Rachel!

14:11.367 --> 14:12.833
I hope this is good news

14:12.867 --> 14:15.433
Not good enough.

14:15.467 --> 14:17.467
Victoria and I talked
with Chelsea's teammates.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.867
Did any of
see the arr

14:18.900 --> 14:21.900
None that admitted to it.
But they said the same thing,

14:21.933 --> 14:24.467
exactly the same thing about
Chelsea being too much

14:24.500 --> 14:26.633
of a team player, never
in any trouble.

14:26.667 --> 14:27.767
Seattle's Sweethear

14:27.800 --> 14:30.367
Right. One did break
ranks a bit,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.533
said Chelsea's not the kind
of person you need to ask

14:32.567 --> 14:34.567
more than once to
return to her vehicle.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.933
Who was

14:35.967 --> 14:39.800
Madison Parker. Second string
striker, behind Chelsea.

14:39.833 --> 14:41.700
How would she know that'
exactly what I s

14:41.733 --> 14:43.767
before I arrested Chelsea

14:43.800 --> 14:46.333
Because she was there to
see it and record it.

14:46.367 --> 14:47.533
Had

14:47.567 --> 14:49.300
Victoria and I could
try to go back at her,

14:49.333 --> 14:50.700
but the team's
clamming up.

14:50.733 --> 14:53.267
I don't think any of them want
to talk to a cop right now.

14:53.300 --> 14:54.733
Maybe s
talk to some

14:54.767 --> 15:03.200
who's not a co
right now.

15:03.233 --> 15:04.867
Madison Parker?

15:04.900 --> 15:06.633
You're that
I can't be seen with you

15:06.667 --> 15:08.933
I'm someone who wants to
hear your version of events.

15:08.967 --> 15:12.300
Please, please talk to me.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.600
You witnessed what happened
between Chelsea and me.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.067
No, I never said tha

15:16.100 --> 15:18.333
But you told my colleagues I
had to ask her more than once

15:18.367 --> 15:19.500
to return to her vehicle.

15:19.533 --> 15:21.300
I only meant, I
that's what happene

15:21.333 --> 15:26.600
It's exactly what happened.
Only it wasn't on the video.

15:26.633 --> 15:29.367
It was

15:29.400 --> 15:31.400
So there's a longer video?

15:31.433 --> 15:33.767
Right from the time yo
pulled up until Chelse

15:33.800 --> 15:35.500
is on the
of the

15:35.533 --> 15:37.667
Walk me through this.
Please.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.800
I left the charity event and
saw Chelsea being full-o

15:40.833 --> 15:43.867
Evil Boyd with that other cop,
so I started recording

15:43.900 --> 15:45.533
Like I said, ri
as you pulled

15:45.567 --> 15:47.733
And then you only sent
part of it to Channel Six?

15:47.767 --> 15:50.633
No, I stuck the whole thing on
a thumb drive and I sent it to

15:50.667 --> 15:53.367
the team's front office
Anonymously. Because I want

15:53.400 --> 15:55.933
them to see what a joke it is
to be calling that monste

15:55.967 --> 15:58.633
Seattle's Sweetheart. They need
to bench her and put me on the

15:58.667 --> 16:02.100
field. I'm as good as sh
is, if not bett

16:02.133 --> 16:07.300
Do you have a copy
of the longer version?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.800
Yeah, on my pho

16:09.833 --> 16:12.433
Okay, Madison, if you
give that to me,

16:12.467 --> 16:14.633
I will let the team,
I mean the whole city --

16:14.667 --> 16:24.067
know exactly who Chelsea is.
It'll help us with our jobs.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.500
You can't tell anybo
you got this from m

16:26.533 --> 16:31.900
Of course.

16:31.933 --> 16:39.600
No, what? It was in here when I
was at practice... it's gone.

16:39.633 --> 16:41.533
Did you leave it
in the locker room?

16:41.567 --> 16:43.800
No, it's g
Someone stole my phone

16:43.833 --> 16:54.133
And the only c
of the video I h

16:54.167 --> 16:55.967
This way, detectives...

16:56.067 --> 16:58.667
Mr. Davont, what exactly are
your duties as Directo

16:58.700 --> 17:00.800
of Player Relati
for the Scorpi

17:00.833 --> 17:03.300
I'm the liaison between
the team and the public.

17:03.333 --> 17:06.067
Primarily, I coordinate
appearances,

17:06.067 --> 17:08.833
charity requests,
fan mail.

17:08.867 --> 17:10.367
Are all those of Chelsea?

17:10.400 --> 17:12.867
She is the team's most
popular player.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.700
Seattle's Sweetheart?

17:14.733 --> 17:17.133
I don't understand why
your detective

17:17.167 --> 17:18.267
brutalized her like that.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.900
Chelsea's a kind and wonderful
person--

17:20.933 --> 17:22.433
So I've heard.

17:22.467 --> 17:24.800
We have reason to believe your
office received a compute

17:24.833 --> 17:26.833
thumb drive. It
sent anonymo

17:26.867 --> 17:29.167
and contains video of th
traffic stop in question

17:29.200 --> 17:30.967
No. We never received
anything like that.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.067
And you see everything that
comes to your office?

17:33.067 --> 17:35.867
I do. And particularly if it
wasn't addressed to anyone

17:35.900 --> 17:38.067
specifically, I'd be the
one to receive it.

17:38.067 --> 17:43.300
I get all the mail, photo
requests, all the weird stuff.

17:43.333 --> 17:46.300
I open everything,
never saw a thumb drive.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.167
Is that the recording that's
been playing on the news?

17:49.200 --> 17:51.733
We have reason to believe
there's more to that footage

17:51.767 --> 17:53.200
than the news has shown.

17:53.233 --> 17:55.900
Including Chelsea Boyd being
aggressive and belligerent.

17:55.933 --> 17:58.067
We also have a source within
your organization that claims

17:58.067 --> 18:02.100
Seattle's Sweetheart isn't
everything she seems to be.

18:02.133 --> 18:03.967
You've been talking
to Madison Parker.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.433
What makes you say that?

18:05.467 --> 18:08.333
She'd do anything to get
Chelsea kicked off the team.

18:08.367 --> 18:09.867
Madison wants
the starting slot.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.133
Is there animosity
between them?

18:11.167 --> 18:12.100
Oh, yeah...

18:12.133 --> 18:13.100
Detectives!

18:14.733 --> 18:16.333
If I had known you were
coming by --

18:16.367 --> 18:17.733
I've got this, Ken.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.067
I'll get the rest
of the PR material.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.167
I didn't realize y
were visiting agai

18:22.200 --> 18:23.967
You really should ha
come to see me firs

18:24.067 --> 18:25.367
What do you need from Ken

18:25.400 --> 18:27.133
We have questions about
how you handle your mail.

18:27.167 --> 18:28.133
Our

18:28.167 --> 18:29.733
And we need to know
who has access

18:29.767 --> 18:30.800
to your team training area.

18:30.833 --> 18:32.400
A whole list of people

18:32.433 --> 18:34.067
Then we'll need
to see that list.

18:34.067 --> 18:37.267
I can send it over, bu
it's pretty much everybod

18:37.300 --> 18:41.400
associated with the team
Mr. Wexler, trainers, Ken

18:41.433 --> 18:44.067
the janitorial staff, an
of course, the players

18:44.067 --> 18:45.367
I understand
were there earli

18:45.400 --> 18:47.400
asking
questions

18:47.433 --> 18:49.867
They're adults, Ms.
Shore, and this is an ongoing

18:49.900 --> 18:52.900
investigation. Our current
focus is determining who sent

18:52.933 --> 18:55.800
a recording of Chelsea Boyd's
arrest to your main office.

18:55.833 --> 18:57.700
And our focus is winnin
this weekend's playoff game.

18:57.733 --> 18:59.867
So I need yo
let me do t

18:59.900 --> 19:04.067
and stop distracting m
people with foolish questions.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.800
May I see you o

19:05.833 --> 19:15.867
No, but you will
see us again.

19:15.867 --> 19:21.167
No, but you will
see us again.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.833
Hey
You hu

19:23.867 --> 19:27.400
Yes! I haven't eaten since
the last time I was eating.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.267
I was thinking abo
what to make for dinner

19:29.300 --> 19:31.433
I thought it might be fu
to go out for burger

19:31.467 --> 19:32.800
I like where
this is going.

19:32.833 --> 19:35.100
We can go to that plac
with the shakes you like

19:35.133 --> 19:39.367
Best news I've
heard all day.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.933
So, we going to
discuss dessert?

19:41.967 --> 19:43.433
No.

19:43.467 --> 19:45.867
I was wondering if you know
anything about your sister --

19:45.900 --> 19:46.967
No.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.167
I didn't fin

19:48.200 --> 19:49.667
However the question
ends, the answer is no.

19:49.700 --> 19:50.967
And it's better that way.

19:51.067 --> 19:53.900
So you don't know
she's seeing someon

19:53.933 --> 19:57.900
You mean, dating someone?
Wow, okay.

19:57.933 --> 20:00.200
Even if I did
know, which I don't,

20:00.233 --> 20:04.800
I wouldn't want to know,
because I can't even --

20:04.833 --> 20:14.867
I love our little talks

20:14.867 --> 20:25.900
I love our little talks

20:25.933 --> 20:27.033
Why
you ea

20:27.067 --> 20:27.967
I'm not hungry

20:28.000 --> 20:32.400
I'll eat it.

20:32.433 --> 20:34.133
You're disgusting.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.400
I've been practicing.

20:36.433 --> 20:38.967
Ken Davont, the guy who would
have gotten the package at

20:39.000 --> 20:41.100
their front office, says
he never got the video.

20:41.133 --> 20:43.333
But he put together that it
was Madison who sent it,

20:43.367 --> 20:45.700
right away.
Said she's a trouble maker.

20:45.733 --> 20:47.200
What's the next move?

20:47.233 --> 20:49.767
We need to go back to Madison,
Officially, this time.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.200
Victoria and I will do what we
can to compel her to testify

20:52.233 --> 21:02.233
about what she saw.

21:02.267 --> 21:05.900
Hey everybody, sorry I'm late.
Mind if I join the party

21:05.933 --> 21:08.233
I was beginning to think I
needed to order something to go.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.067
Let me find the waitress.

21:10.100 --> 21:13.067
T

21:13.100 --> 21:17.133
I thought being suspende
meant not worki

21:17.167 --> 21:18.867
It means I can't come
into the precinct.

21:18.900 --> 21:23.433
But I just wanted to know
what was going on.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.800
What's up with Sunshine

21:25.833 --> 21:33.067
I'll tell you later.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.333
Hey! You're that cop
from the news.

21:35.367 --> 21:36.867
The one who beat
up Chelsea Boyd!

21:36.900 --> 21:38.267
No, I didn't --

21:38.300 --> 21:40.067
She better not be hurt! We
could lose our playoff game

21:40.067 --> 21:41.167
because of you!

21:41.200 --> 21:45.067
Hey, get
from my

21:45.067 --> 21:46.767
Matt -- Ma'am, why don't
you sit down

21:46.800 --> 21:47.900
and leave my wife alone.

21:47.933 --> 21:49.300
Don't talk to my
wife that way.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.367
You mean, with twice the
respect she just showed mine?

21:51.400 --> 21:53.200
You think you're a tough
guy because you're

21:53.233 --> 21:54.367
married to some
rogue cop?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.933
What're you gonna
do, call more cops?

21:55.967 --> 22:03.233
Already here.

22:03.267 --> 22:12.067
Come on honey, let's go.
Not worth our time.

22:12.067 --> 22:13.533
I'm so sorry you guys.

22:13.567 --> 22:23.600
I want to go ho

22:23.600 --> 22:33.867
I want to go ho

22:33.900 --> 22:36.100
Okay, here they come.

22:36.133 --> 22:37.167
There's Mon

22:37.200 --> 22:45.433
There's Baker.

22:45.467 --> 22:47.200
You thi
missed

22:47.233 --> 22:49.067
We've been here
since practice ended.

22:49.067 --> 22:59.067
Madison ha
still be ins

22:59.067 --> 23:08.533
Madison ha
still be ins

23:08.567 --> 23:11.200
Madison?

23:12.933 --> 23:16.533
Anybody here?

23:16.567 --> 23:18.067
Madison?

23:19.533 --> 23:24.067
Help me please!

23:24.067 --> 23:26.433
Madison!

23:26.467 --> 23:28.933
Unit 37, requesting
immediate medical assist.

23:28.967 --> 23:31.400
4208 Scorpio
Drive, physio room.

23:31.433 --> 23:32.500
What happened he

23:32.533 --> 23:44.367
This is your fault!
Stay away from me!

23:44.400 --> 23:47.567
I can't adequately express
the sadness I feel about this

23:47.600 --> 23:50.767
vicious attack on my
dear friend and teammate,

23:50.800 --> 23:52.467
Madison Parker.

23:52.500 --> 23:53.733
Thank you, Chels

23:53.767 --> 23:55.800
I know the pain
violence can cause.

23:55.833 --> 23:58.800
No one should have to suffer the
way she and I have both suffered

23:58.833 --> 24:00.700
these last few days.

24:00.733 --> 24:03.067
Do you think this attack is
related to the treatment you

24:03.067 --> 24:06.533
suffered at the hands
of the Crestview police?

24:06.567 --> 24:08.133
I hope not.

24:08.167 --> 24:12.533
It's time for the hurting to
stop and the healing to begin.

24:12.567 --> 24:14.067
Will this be affecting
your preparations for

24:14.067 --> 24:15.433
the big game
this weekend?

24:15.467 --> 24:17.933
If anything, we will be
more focused than ever because

24:17.967 --> 24:21.067
we will win this
game for Madison Parker.

24:21.100 --> 24:23.133
Thank yo
for your conce

24:23.167 --> 24:25.800
All right, Madison needs her
rest and Chelsea needs to get

24:25.833 --> 24:27.533
back on the field.
Thank you.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.833
Chelsea, one more
question, the police....

24:28.867 --> 24:41.567
Thank you.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.667
Can we have a momen

24:44.700 --> 24:47.067
You know actually,
I'm really glad you came by.

24:47.067 --> 24:48.833
It gives me a
chance to say thanks.

24:48.867 --> 24:50.500
None of this would have
happened without you.

24:50.533 --> 24:53.867
I should never have talked
to you. Any of you.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.500
I'm sorry you were hurt
Who did this to you, Madison?

24:56.533 --> 25:00.533
Right, because I don't
already have enough problems.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.933
If you
protecti

25:01.967 --> 25:03.967
Yes, I do. From people who want
me to talk about things

25:04.067 --> 25:07.067
that I don't want
to talk about.

25:07.067 --> 25:09.933
We still need your help. We need
you to testify to what you saw,

25:09.967 --> 25:11.400
what was on that tap

25:11.433 --> 25:24.667
I'm sorry, I've said everything
I want to say. Game's over.

25:24.700 --> 25:27.567
ey. Whoever roughed up MadisonH
has her convinced something

25:27.600 --> 25:29.467
worse will happn
if she speaks ot

25:29.500 --> 25:32.800
It's got to be Ken Davont. He
figured out Madison made the

25:32.833 --> 25:35.867
video. Maybe he went overboard
persuading her to keep quiet.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.900
Do you think part of hi
job is kee

25:37.933 --> 25:39.367
Seattle's Sweethea
looking sw

25:39.400 --> 25:40.767
Sounds like motive to me.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.467
Maybe they have a fu
recording of the arrest

25:42.500 --> 25:44.700
Victoria and I will bring
him in and press him hard.

25:44.733 --> 25:46.800
Thanks D
For everyth

25:46.833 --> 25:56.867
Hey, I gotta get
my partner back.

25:56.867 --> 26:07.767
Hey, I gotta get
my partner back.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.700
Chris!
What're you doing here?

26:11.733 --> 26:13.233
Just checking

26:13.267 --> 26:15.933
Making sure your aunt hasn't
been beating you up too

26:15.967 --> 26:18.300
Don't talk about Chelsea Boyd.
You don't know what happened.

26:18.333 --> 26:21.867
I know what I saw.
An

26:21.900 --> 26:23.867
your cousin say anythin
about the picture I drew

26:23.900 --> 26:25.067
Let me see...
nothing?

26:25.067 --> 26:26.533
But you gave it to her

26:26.567 --> 26:27.933
Sure, that doesn't
mean we have

26:27.967 --> 26:30.867
heart-to-heart
conversations.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.067
I guess I'll h
to ask her myse

26:33.067 --> 26:36.067
Hey...
she's my cousin.

26:36.067 --> 26:38.067
Well, I won't hold tha
against

26:38.100 --> 26:40.267
Hey.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.167
So you do remember. I didn't
hear anything about the picture,

26:44.200 --> 26:47.500
so I didn't know.

26:47.533 --> 26:49.733
Um, you're a good artist

26:49.767 --> 26:53.867
Thanks.
At least I have one fan...

26:53.900 --> 27:00.267
Why did you draw tha

27:00.300 --> 27:02.067
I just wanted to
get to know you.

27:02.067 --> 27:04.767
I want you to know me.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.767
Look, I got to know yo
well enough that nig

27:06.800 --> 27:07.967
you were at our hous

27:08.067 --> 27:10.800
No, that was not my
finest moment.

27:10.833 --> 27:18.800
It's just, I get weird when
I'm talking with pretty girls,

27:18.833 --> 27:22.767
and I thought, maybe if
I did something nice,

27:22.800 --> 27:25.067
I could make
it up to you?

27:25.067 --> 27:26.133
Rach

27:26.167 --> 27:27.533
Mom...

27:27.567 --> 27:29.167
I've been waiting wi
Jeff and Mariah in the car.

27:29.200 --> 27:29.833
Later,

27:29.867 --> 27:31.400
Peace!

27:31.433 --> 27:33.067
I'm sorry to keep
you waiting, Mom.

27:33.067 --> 27:35.067
Don't you want
introduce me to your friend?

27:35.067 --> 27:36.400
No, that's really
not necessary.

27:36.433 --> 27:38.833
Hi, I'm
McLean, Rachel's mother

27:38.867 --> 27:40.333
Chris Rutherford.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.933
Chris? As in Cameron
friend C

27:42.967 --> 27:46.867
Yeah, Cameron
and I go way back.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.167
You're also the artist

27:49.200 --> 27:51.067
Mom, can we
just go, please?

27:51.100 --> 27:52.800
She showed you
my drawing?

27:52.833 --> 27:56.067
Nice
Good to meet y

27:56.067 --> 28:06.167
Rachel, come

28:06.167 --> 28:13.267
Rachel, come

28:13.300 --> 28:15.900
Here's how we think this
went down, Ken.

28:15.933 --> 28:18.733
Chelsea gets arrested, and
Al Wexler starts sweating.

28:18.767 --> 28:22.800
Can't have his star player
in jail before playoffs.

28:22.833 --> 28:26.067
Then, like a gift from the gods,
a video shows up at the front

28:26.067 --> 28:29.467
office. Only it shows the real
Chelsea Boyd, the one that

28:29.500 --> 28:32.333
kicks and bites and
disobeys orders.

28:32.367 --> 28:35.167
So you cut the video, take
out what makes Chelsea look

28:35.200 --> 28:37.867
bad; make the police
look bad, instead.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.367
I don't
anything about

28:39.400 --> 28:42.067
But you knew exactly who sent
it when we told you about it.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.767
And that very same night, we
find that person injured in

28:44.800 --> 28:46.800
the team's physio room.

28:46.833 --> 28:48.700
You think I'm the o
who went after Madison

28:48.733 --> 28:50.333
I think that's what she'll
testify, once we convince

28:50.367 --> 28:52.067
her she doesn't have to be
afraid anymore.

28:52.067 --> 28:55.167
I'd never do something like
that to Madison, or anybody!

28:55.200 --> 28:57.733
If it meant protecting Chelsea
Boyd, I think there are a lot

28:57.767 --> 28:59.067
of things you'd do.

28:59.067 --> 29:05.333
No. Because I k
what it's like to be -

29:05.367 --> 29:14.300
What it's like to be...
what, Ken?

29:14.333 --> 29:17.067
Because I know w
it's like t

29:17.100 --> 29:26.433
beaten
Chelsea Boyd, ok

29:26.467 --> 29:36.500
I n
speak to my lawy

29:36.500 --> 29:54.800
I n
speak to my lawy

29:54.833 --> 29:57.067
Rachel.

29:57.067 --> 29:59.200
Are you going to tell me about
your relationship with this

29:59.233 --> 30:01.100
guy who you said
was just some guy?

30:01.133 --> 30:03.033
Look, I ba
even know him, oka

30:03.067 --> 30:04.967
Then why did he draw
that picture of you?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.367
I don't

30:06.400 --> 30:10.200
Chris came into this house
when he wasn't supposed to.

30:10.233 --> 30:12.267
Do we have to
review that mess again?

30:12.300 --> 30:15.000
No Mom, th
done and over with, okay

30:15.033 --> 30:17.300
When I asked you about the
picture -- why he's still

30:17.333 --> 30:22.133
thinking of you -- why
didn't you just tell me?

30:22.167 --> 30:24.833
Because maybe if you
stopped interrogating me

30:24.867 --> 30:37.467
I wouldn't feel
like such a crimina

30:37.500 --> 30:40.467
Rachel better not be seeing
Chris. That kid is trouble.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.900
I don't want any of our kids
hanging out with him.

30:42.933 --> 30:44.900
I don't know why she didn't
tell me everyth

30:44.933 --> 30:46.500
when I first as
her abou

30:46.533 --> 30:49.333
All she cared about was that I
was snooping in her bedroom.

30:49.367 --> 30:52.467
You guys have
different priorities.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.333
I'm already the bad gu
from here to Bellingham

30:54.367 --> 30:57.200
Why do I have to be th
bad guy in my own house

30:57.233 --> 31:00.333
You're not the bad guy.
You're just doing your job.

31:00.367 --> 31:02.467
As a cop and a mom.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.633
Can you please t
our daughter th

31:04.667 --> 31:08.333
And repe
a couple of tim

31:08.367 --> 31:14.300
Plea

31:14.333 --> 31:16.333
We have a playoff
game in two days.

31:16.367 --> 31:20.467
I don't have
time for this.

31:20.500 --> 31:23.233
Just a couple
of questions.

31:23.267 --> 31:25.100
I already told everybody about
what happened when that

31:25.133 --> 31:27.567
maniac with a
badge attacked me.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.933
This isn't about what happened
with Detective McLean,

31:29.967 --> 31:33.433
whom I'd like you to refer to
as Detective McLean.

31:33.467 --> 31:35.167
This is about where
you were last night

31:35.200 --> 31:36.400
when Madison was
attacked.

31:36.433 --> 31:37.533
I was at practice.

31:37.567 --> 31:40.133
And after t

31:40.167 --> 31:42.200
I iced, showered,
and went home.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.500
Right. Except we we
standing right outside

31:44.533 --> 31:45.933
watching everyone leave

31:45.967 --> 31:49.900
And the one person
didn't see was y

31:49.933 --> 31:51.333
I went out the back.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.567
That'd be real convenient, if
it didn't sound like you were

31:53.600 --> 31:55.133
making it up.

31:55.167 --> 31:57.600
I would never do something
like that to Madison.

31:57.633 --> 32:02.600
Because you're not
that kind of girl?

32:02.633 --> 32:06.333
What kind of a
girl does this?

32:06.367 --> 32:09.100
About a year ago, when Ken
Davont was working as striker

32:09.133 --> 32:12.167
coach, he filed an assault
report with the Seattle Police.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.400
It was right after tha
game against Portlan

32:14.433 --> 32:17.367
where you missed the penalty
kick in the last three seconds.

32:17.400 --> 32:23.467
Do you remember that game
Pretty sure you los

32:23.500 --> 32:26.067
You lef
field pretty ups

32:26.100 --> 32:28.333
Maybe you needed someon
to take your anger out on

32:28.367 --> 32:34.400
Who better to
blame than your coach?

32:34.433 --> 32:38.233
I was never
charged with that crime.

32:38.267 --> 32:42.100
But here's something
interesting. Your name is in

32:42.133 --> 32:46.200
the initial report. Then a few
days later, the official report

32:46.233 --> 32:48.367
comes out, and it lists that Ken
was attacked

32:48.400 --> 32:50.567
by an unknown assailant.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.633
So
lot like Madison's story

32:52.667 --> 32:54.333
Yeah, but nobody was ever
arrested.

32:54.367 --> 32:57.733
And then a week later, Ken gets
transferred to player relations,

32:57.767 --> 33:00.067
a cushy little offi
job with a nice pay bump

33:00.067 --> 33:02.333
Makes us wonder if somebody
was trying to keep him quiet

33:02.367 --> 33:05.367
regarding what he knew about a
player with a violent side.

33:05.400 --> 33:12.400
With coaches, with players,
With cops.

33:12.433 --> 33:14.067
Are we done?

33:14.067 --> 33:16.067
We can be done once you tell
us who has the original video.

33:16.100 --> 33:18.833
You know, the one you don't
want anyone to s

33:18.867 --> 33:21.333
The only video I know about
is the one everyone else is

33:21.367 --> 33:25.100
watching. The one where --
Detective McLean smacked

33:25.133 --> 33:28.767
me down. I don't hold it against
her. I just prefer to take out

33:28.800 --> 33:35.600
my aggression on the field.

33:35.633 --> 33:38.800
So, do you want to let me get
out there and score one for

33:38.833 --> 33:51.600
the Crestview Police
Department or what?

33:51.633 --> 33:53.233
So what did she give you?

33:53.267 --> 33:56.267
Nothing. The assault report
didn't even make Chelsea blink.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.100
And we're no closer to
finding the original video?

33:58.133 --> 33:59.233
We'll keep at

33:59.267 --> 34:00.733
And is there anything that
ties Chelsea

34:00.767 --> 34:02.067
to the attack on Madison?

34:02.100 --> 34:03.833
Nothing we can prov

34:03.867 --> 34:07.300
I am so ready to be back
at work, I can't stand it!

34:07.333 --> 34:10.700
You wil
I'll figure out a wa

34:10.733 --> 34:13.500
You'd better.

34:13.533 --> 34:26.133
Yeah I wil

34:26.167 --> 34:29.433
I don't know why you bothered to
come see me. We're going to run

34:29.467 --> 34:32.167
the story until it plays out,
and I already told you I'm not

34:32.200 --> 34:34.133
telling anyone who sen
me the v

34:34.167 --> 34:37.800
I respect where you're coming
from. Journalistic integrity

34:37.833 --> 34:40.967
and ethics. The police have a
code of our own, and I don't

34:41.067 --> 34:45.633
want to break it either. But
maybe we can bend things

34:45.667 --> 34:49.533
a little. You like
a good story?

34:49.567 --> 34:52.267
How about one that proves
Chelsea Boyd has a history of

34:52.300 --> 34:59.467
violence that people have
been covering up for her?

34:59.500 --> 35:00.633
Chelsea did th

35:00.667 --> 35:02.867
She did.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.533
And you can be the one
who breaks the story.

35:05.567 --> 35:08.667
That could be hu
Than

35:08.700 --> 35:21.600
After you tell me who
gave you the video.

35:21.633 --> 35:23.700
Ma'am, I need you
return to your vehicle

35:23.733 --> 35:25.400
You can't tell
me what to do.

35:25.433 --> 35:27.267
Yes, ma'am, I c

35:27.300 --> 35:29.333
Because you're so
special, right?

35:29.367 --> 35:30.867
If you
return to your vehicle

35:30.900 --> 35:32.467
I will place
under ar

35:32.500 --> 35:35.267
The only way I'm moving is
if you make me, so...

35:35.300 --> 35:38.533
As a police office
I'm prepared to do that

35:38.567 --> 35:42.100
Ow! Tha
not

35:42.133 --> 35:43.700
Get away from me!

35:43.733 --> 35:47.300
Ma'am, I am placing yo
under arrest, come here

35:47.333 --> 35:52.633
Ow! You're hurting me!
You're hurting me!

35:52.667 --> 35:55.333
Ma'am, I am plac
you under arre

35:55.367 --> 35:59.467
Ow! Let me go, you
can't do this! Ow!

35:59.500 --> 36:01.467
Sit still. You have th
right to remain silent

36:01.500 --> 36:02.967
I did not do anything.

36:03.067 --> 36:05.767
You have the right to a
attorney. If you can't afford

36:05.800 --> 36:07.867
an attorney one will b
provided for you

36:07.900 --> 36:13.967
You're gonna pay for this!
My shoulder! It's absolutely--

36:14.067 --> 36:16.567
You do know video files
deleted on your computer

36:16.600 --> 36:18.600
aren't ever really
deleted, right?

36:18.633 --> 36:20.933
Didn't take long for our
tech guys to find this.

36:20.967 --> 36:23.400
There's no law again
supplying a story to the press.

36:23.433 --> 36:25.333
No, but there's a law against

36:25.367 --> 36:27.067
withholding evidence
from the police.

36:27.067 --> 36:29.367
And -- what's that one where
you pay someone

36:29.400 --> 36:30.333
to change their story?

36:30.367 --> 36:31.800
Extortion.

36:31.833 --> 36:35.767
Which is what Naomi
did with Ken Davont.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.700
Ken gave us a
statement through his lawyer.

36:37.733 --> 36:40.467
Says you gave him a
job in exchange for

36:40.500 --> 36:43.333
keeping quiet after
Chelsea beat him up.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.633
If we kept digging, we're gonna
find you've been covering for

36:45.667 --> 36:47.800
Chelsea for years, aren't we?

36:47.833 --> 36:49.433
Is that why you went
after Madison?

36:49.467 --> 36:50.800
To get her to
shut up, too?

36:50.833 --> 36:52.233
Did Madison say tha

36:52.267 --> 36:54.633
You got a cover story ready if
she did? It all starts right

36:54.667 --> 36:57.533
here, Naomi. You're the one
who got the video,

36:57.567 --> 36:58.867
you're the one
who cut it down,

36:58.900 --> 37:01.733
and you're the one who
sent it to Channel Six.

37:01.767 --> 37:03.767
We've got you on that,
and the extortion charge

37:03.800 --> 37:05.467
with Ken Davont.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.733
Then we'll add
assault and battery

37:06.767 --> 37:08.400
because of what you
did to Madison.

37:08.433 --> 37:11.433
You're looking at a lot of
years -- and a lot more for

37:11.467 --> 37:14.833
obstructing our
investigation along the way.

37:14.867 --> 37:18.400
I... I didn't mean f
that to happen to Madison

37:18.433 --> 37:19.600
That's not why I was there.

37:19.633 --> 37:20.767
But you went to see her?

37:20.800 --> 37:22.833
To work out a de

37:22.867 --> 37:24.600
Ken told me
were talking about her

37:24.633 --> 37:27.367
and I realized
must have shot the video

37:27.400 --> 37:31.533
She said it was her, an
I told her not to stir u

37:31.567 --> 37:36.833
more trouble -- Madison i
always stirring up trouble.

37:36.867 --> 37:38.433
But she wouldn't listen

37:38.467 --> 37:40.433
So you forced
her to listen.

37:40.467 --> 37:46.433
I lost my temper a
pushed her. Just a little

37:46.467 --> 37:52.667
She fell and hit her head
I panick

37:52.700 --> 37:57.267
I left... If she'd listened
the first time, she'd be fine.

37:57.300 --> 38:00.067
She ruined everythin

38:00.067 --> 38:01.933
Does Wexler make
you do this?

38:01.967 --> 38:04.133
Make you clean up
Chelsea's messes?

38:04.167 --> 38:08.433
No, he doe
know anyth

38:08.467 --> 38:14.367
Then why do you do it?

38:14.400 --> 38:16.433
Are you goo
sports, detecti

38:16.467 --> 38:17.833
I do pretty well.

38:17.867 --> 38:25.067
I never was. But I love the
game, working as a team

38:25.100 --> 38:29.600
So I decided, if I couldn't play
on a team, I could build one.

38:29.633 --> 38:34.067
A strong one. I got a job with
the Scorpios out of college.

38:34.100 --> 38:37.400
Signed some gr
players, got Seattle to fall

38:37.433 --> 38:42.067
in love with th
elevated our ga

38:42.067 --> 38:48.567
But then I had to ho
it all toget

38:48.600 --> 38:51.867
You want to know who's favored
to win this weekend's game?

38:51.900 --> 38:55.833
The Scor
Because of

38:55.867 --> 39:01.667
Because of my h
work and sacrifice

39:01.700 --> 39:16.533
But I sit in the stand
and nobody cheers for me

39:16.567 --> 39:24.767
Nobody knows who I a

39:24.800 --> 39:27.067
The Use-Of-Force team
reviewed the entire video,

39:27.067 --> 39:30.767
and confirmed that you followed
procedure to the letter.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.733
Just doing my job, ma'am

39:32.767 --> 39:37.867
I'm glad you can
get back to it.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.067
Detective?

39:39.100 --> 39:41.833
Ma'

39:41.867 --> 39:46.167
Get back to it.

39:46.200 --> 39:53.333
Not so
anymore, Chels

39:53.367 --> 39:57.633
Let's go.

39:57.667 --> 40:00.700
Disorderly conduct
and resisting arrest.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.600
And we've got the
video to prove it.

40:02.633 --> 40:06.333
How'd you figure out who had it?
And how it got to Channel Six?

40:06.367 --> 40:11.533
I can be very persuasive.

40:11.567 --> 40:13.933
The Scorpios are singing a
different song now that the

40:13.967 --> 40:16.167
history of Chelsea Boyd's
violent behavior has been

40:16.200 --> 40:20.533
xposed. Team legal counsel,e
Naomi Shore, is also facing

40:20.567 --> 40:24.133
charges with this growing
candal involving everythings

40:24.167 --> 40:27.633
from bribes to beatings...

40:27.667 --> 40:30.633
This newly released video,
howing the incident in full,s

40:30.667 --> 40:32.933
puts the traffic stop and
actions that followed in a

40:32.967 --> 40:44.967
completely different light...

40:45.000 --> 40:47.500
Hey, you're on TV again

40:47.533 --> 40:48.767
How do I look this time?

40:48.800 --> 40:53.433
A lot better.

40:53.467 --> 40:56.400
You kind of look like a warrior
the way you took her down.

40:56.433 --> 40:58.867
Thanks, I think.

40:58.900 --> 41:01.900
Congratulations.
What's all this?

41:01.933 --> 41:04.767
I thought we were
supposed to eat without you.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.800
This is just stuff to
make ice cream sundaes.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.833
Oh!

41:10.867 --> 41:23.500
Rachel, can you help
me get it set up?

41:23.533 --> 41:25.100
This extra
I've had at ho

41:25.133 --> 41:28.100
I don't think I spent i
as well as I could have

41:28.133 --> 41:29.667
I wasn't snoopi

41:29.700 --> 41:32.867
I know, you were
putting away laundry.

41:32.900 --> 41:35.900
No, I was worryi

41:35.933 --> 41:37.800
I appreciate that, Mom.

41:37.833 --> 41:39.933
But I can handle more
than you think I can.

41:39.967 --> 41:42.633
I know. As you get older
it's harder for me to ge

41:42.667 --> 41:47.500
out of the way
let you do

41:47.533 --> 41:49.200
I'll work on

41:49.233 --> 41:51.800
Okay.

41:51.833 --> 41:54.067
Besides, I would never date
a guy like Chris, anyway.

41:54.100 --> 41:58.467
Will you tell your dad that,
when you get a chance? Thanks.

41:58.500 --> 42:01.067
A guy who doesn't respect
boundaries is a waste of time.

42:01.100 --> 42:02.767
Do I hear ice cream meltin?

42:02.800 --> 42:04.700
Yes yo
come and get
