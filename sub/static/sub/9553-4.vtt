POTSIE:
Hey, there's Lori Glass.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.130
RICHIE:
Have you got something
going with Lori Glass?

01:34.630 --> 01:37.130
Well, I helped her in
biology, and she loves me.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.130
Who are you trying
to kid, Potsie?

01:39.130 --> 01:41.130
He drew a chart of
the digestive system for her,

01:41.130 --> 01:42.140
and she said,
"Thank you."

01:42.140 --> 01:43.140
No, she's
hot for me.

01:43.140 --> 01:44.470
We looked at medical
books together.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.610
Hey, cool it, cool it.

01:48.610 --> 01:49.610
Here she comes.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.890
LORI:
Potsie.

01:50.890 --> 01:51.980
Yeah?

01:51.980 --> 01:53.480
Mr. Higgins really
liked the chart.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.980
He especially liked the way
you followed the jujube

01:55.980 --> 01:57.980
all the way through
the large intestine.

01:58.490 --> 01:58.990
(chuckles)

01:59.490 --> 02:01.200
It was nothing.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.410
LORI:
Say, how are you

02:02.410 --> 02:05.490
at drawing the
reproductive system?

02:05.490 --> 02:06.880
Can't you get arrested
for that?

02:06.880 --> 02:07.960
(Lori chuckles)

02:07.960 --> 02:09.130
LORI:
I know you'll do it

02:09.130 --> 02:10.710
just terrific.

02:10.710 --> 02:12.220
Yeah.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.220
(chuckles)

02:13.220 --> 02:14.220
Are you kissing
my girl?

02:14.220 --> 02:15.220
Oh, no.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.220
Uh, she was just thanking me
for helping her.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.220
Right guys?
RICHIE:
Yeah, right.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.640
Oh, yeah, yeah, he was helping
her with reproduction.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.730
(screams)

02:22.730 --> 02:24.230
Well, I-I meant
biology.

02:24.230 --> 02:25.730
You're dead.
Careful, this is
my lucky shirt.

02:25.730 --> 02:28.230
Bernie.

02:28.230 --> 02:29.680
Hey, will you tell him
that he's innocent?

02:29.680 --> 02:31.650
I don't want to
get involved.

02:31.650 --> 02:34.240
All right, come on, listen,
it's-it's no problem, really.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.020
He's just...

02:39.360 --> 02:41.360
I just hope for your sake that
you're helping my good friend

02:41.860 --> 02:43.700
up to his feet here.

02:43.700 --> 02:44.830
Who are you?

02:44.830 --> 02:47.250
Hey, what are you,
from out of town?

02:48.590 --> 02:51.090
I'm taking him outside
to bust his head in,

02:51.090 --> 02:52.540
unless you want to go
in his place, big mouth.

02:55.010 --> 02:57.010
Big mouth?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.510
All right, look, look,
it's all a misunderstanding.

02:58.510 --> 03:00.010
He was just trying
to help your girl

03:00.010 --> 03:01.800
with homework,
and that's all.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.350
Is that true?

03:03.350 --> 03:05.390
Yes.

03:05.390 --> 03:06.890
Why didn't you say so?

03:06.890 --> 03:07.890
(hoarse):
I tried.

03:07.890 --> 03:09.390
What's the matter
with your voice?

03:09.890 --> 03:10.390
(hoarse):
I'm scared.

03:12.890 --> 03:13.890
Hey, uh, Bernard.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.200
Bernie.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.280
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.780
Bernard, I thought that we
had a rendezvous outside.

03:19.780 --> 03:20.780
It's settled, Fonz.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.290
Hey, I'll tell you
when it's settled.

03:22.290 --> 03:23.570
Let's go, Bernie.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.150
Hey, what are we fighting for?

03:25.150 --> 03:26.660
We don't even know each other.

03:26.660 --> 03:27.740
Hey, you know me.

03:27.740 --> 03:28.740
I'm big mouth!

03:28.740 --> 03:29.740
But it's a mistake.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.240
Hey, I heard "big mouth"
loud and clear,

03:31.240 --> 03:33.160
and now, Mr. Tourist, I am gonna

03:33.160 --> 03:35.470
show you the parking
lot upside down!

03:35.470 --> 03:37.250

we're gonna see a fight!

04:01.860 --> 04:03.110
Was the place
condemned?

04:03.110 --> 04:05.780
There's a fight outside.

04:05.780 --> 04:06.860
Oh, no.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.280
Are they beating up
my cook again?

04:10.700 --> 04:11.780
No, it's Fonzie again.

04:11.780 --> 04:13.340
Oh, Fonzie again.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.870
Way to go, Fonz!
That was great!

04:17.870 --> 04:18.880
All right!

04:18.880 --> 04:19.880
Fonz, that fight
was so short,

04:19.880 --> 04:22.380
it was hardly worth
going outside.

04:22.380 --> 04:24.380
Yeah, that's 'cause
I save my energy

04:24.380 --> 04:25.380
for the better things
in life.

04:25.380 --> 04:26.880
Plant one right there.
You, too, right here.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.380
All right.

04:28.380 --> 04:31.390
We'll continue this frivolity
some other time, girls.

04:31.390 --> 04:32.890
Later.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.890
Cunningham, you missed
a spectacular fight.

04:34.890 --> 04:36.390
Oh, yeah?

04:36.390 --> 04:38.700
I was just looking for
a good college to go to.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.280
Yeah, it was one of my more
economical fights.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.570
Short and sweet, dig it?

04:42.570 --> 04:45.650
Purdue is a nice campus,
tree-lined.

04:45.650 --> 04:47.650
Why do they call themselves
Boilermakers?

04:47.650 --> 04:48.740
What are you talking about?

04:48.740 --> 04:50.240
I just saved Potso's life.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.290
I am a hero.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.380
Hero?

04:52.380 --> 04:53.380
Yeah.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.490
(chuckles)

04:54.490 --> 04:57.080
Don't ha-ha-ha-ha me.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.080
Now, come on,
there's something bugging you.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.720
What are you not saying here?

04:59.720 --> 05:01.300
Fonz.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.300
Yeah?

05:02.300 --> 05:03.800
You didn't have to have
that fight,

05:03.800 --> 05:05.470
because Bernie backed down.

05:05.470 --> 05:09.640
Are you saying the Fonz
provokes fights?

05:09.640 --> 05:12.730
You did the same thing
this morning in the bakery.

05:12.730 --> 05:13.730
He fights in bakeries?

05:13.730 --> 05:15.730
All right, come on,
a guy knocked over

05:15.730 --> 05:16.730
my bag of
sweet rolls.

05:16.730 --> 05:17.730
He apologized.

05:17.730 --> 05:19.740
He even offered to buy you
jelly doughnuts.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.240
Then you tried to stuff the guy
in the bread slicer.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.740
The bread slicer?

05:24.740 --> 05:25.740
I just tried
to scare him.

05:25.740 --> 05:27.240
It wasn't even
plugged in.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.250
Okay, all right, be funny,
do what you want to do.

05:30.250 --> 05:31.750
Ohio State Buckeyes.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.330
All right, will you stop
with the Ohio State?

05:34.330 --> 05:36.840
Now, are you saying there is
something wrong with me?

05:36.840 --> 05:38.920
Well, no, I'm just...

05:38.920 --> 05:40.920
I think that you've been getting
in a lot of fights, Fonz.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.930
Yeah?
And I just think that you...

05:42.930 --> 05:45.760
Yeah, I think there's
something wrong with you.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.850
(nasally):
All right, now look
what you're doing, Fonz.

05:48.850 --> 05:50.350
You're hurting my nose.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.850
I'm very disappointed
in you, Fonzie.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.360
You're
disappointed?

05:55.360 --> 05:56.860
Well, let me ask you
one small question.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.360
What?

05:59.360 --> 06:01.360
Who cares?

06:03.860 --> 06:05.870
(nasally):
I care.

06:19.910 --> 06:22.500
Are you still sulking
about your allowance?

06:22.500 --> 06:25.000
Now, look, I told you,
we got to start saving money.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.500
Your brother's gonna be
going to college soon.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.890
You know it's gonna
cost me $700 a year?

06:30.890 --> 06:33.480
Dad, I'm 14 years old.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.480
I can't live off
50 cents a week allowance.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.980
You should see
what I have to sit with

06:37.980 --> 06:39.320
just to get a free Coke.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.020
I wonder what she does
for a milkshake.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.610
Look what Arthur

06:47.610 --> 06:48.610
brought us this morning.

06:48.610 --> 06:51.110
Jelly doughnuts for dessert.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.110
Oh, yeah, I
don't want any.

06:53.110 --> 06:54.110
Why is he angry?

06:54.110 --> 06:57.620
He gets a dollar
a week.

06:57.620 --> 06:59.620
You know, Fonzie beat up
a guy for those doughnuts.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.670
That's what I'm gonna
have to do soon.

07:02.670 --> 07:04.620
You be quiet, Joanie.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.710
Arthur got in
another fight?

07:06.710 --> 07:08.510
Two today.

07:08.510 --> 07:12.100
Well, now, I can't enjoy
these doughnuts anymore.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.470
I can.

07:16.050 --> 07:19.140
All right, just ignore me,
just ignore me.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.220
Cunningham, I got to talk
to you in private, huh?

07:21.220 --> 07:22.730
You gonna
grab my nose?

07:22.730 --> 07:24.230
No, I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna grab your nose.

07:24.230 --> 07:26.450
I want to talk to you about
my little problem, all right?

07:26.450 --> 07:29.200
Is it about the two fights
you had today?

07:29.200 --> 07:31.280
Hey, Cunningham,
what are you, a town crier?

07:31.280 --> 07:33.290
No, Arthur.

07:33.290 --> 07:35.790
Uh, now, if this
fighting thing is a problem,

07:35.790 --> 07:37.290
you can tell us about it.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.290
I mean, we're family.

07:41.410 --> 07:44.080
Well, if he's family,
what's his allowance?

07:44.080 --> 07:46.170
Joanie.

07:46.170 --> 07:47.170
Now, never mind,
Arthur.

07:47.170 --> 07:48.670
Come and tell us
your problem.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.170
Go right
ahead, Fonz.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.670
It-it, look, it's a very simple,
it's just that, you know,

07:53.670 --> 07:57.180
I'm-I'm walking down the street,
and, uh, so, tha-- oh, uh, uh,

07:57.180 --> 07:58.680
so I'm coming down the street
and-and, you know, and I-I--

07:59.180 --> 08:01.180
so I have to go around the
corner or something like that,

08:01.180 --> 08:02.180
you know, and...

08:02.180 --> 08:04.150
So are-are you
following me so far? You know.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.570
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

08:05.570 --> 08:07.650
You didn't say anything.

08:07.650 --> 08:09.240
That's 'cause I can't.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.240
I can't talk
in front of certain people.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.830
Let's go.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.330
Now I'm standing
here alone!

08:20.330 --> 08:21.330
I didn't mean that.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.340
Guys, come back here.

08:22.340 --> 08:23.340
I'm talking about
the ladies,

08:23.340 --> 08:25.340
I can't talk
in front of the ladies.

08:25.340 --> 08:27.840
I mean, the thing is
that I'm getting tense.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.340
I mean, I-I don't know
what's happening to me.

08:29.340 --> 08:30.840
I just want to hit
all of a sudden.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.350
That's not me, that's not
the Fonz, the Fonz don't hit.

08:33.850 --> 08:36.850
What am I
supposed to do?

08:36.850 --> 08:37.770
Dad, what should he do?

08:41.690 --> 08:45.190
Oh, well, it's, uh,
it's perfectly clear, Fonzie.

08:45.190 --> 08:48.190
I mean, you just can't go around
picking fights with people

08:48.190 --> 08:49.200
and beating them up.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.200
Violence is dangerous!

08:51.200 --> 08:53.200
There's only one thing
you can do.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.700
FONZIE:
Yeah?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.040
You got to snap out of it.

09:00.410 --> 09:01.910
Snap out of it?

09:01.910 --> 09:02.910
That's it?

09:02.910 --> 09:04.410
Snap out of it?

09:04.410 --> 09:06.410
No, no. See, that was
just the first part of it.

09:06.410 --> 09:07.910
He's gonna tell you more.

09:07.910 --> 09:10.380
You're gonna tell him more,
aren't you, Dad?

09:10.380 --> 09:12.920
No, that was it.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.500
Well, Dad, come on, "Snap out
of it" is a little weak.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.090
Well, that's what they used
to tell us in the Army,

09:17.090 --> 09:18.670
"Snap out of
it, soldier."

09:18.670 --> 09:22.010
MARION:
Howard, tell him
about your problem.

09:22.010 --> 09:24.600
That was a family
matter, Marion.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.100
Well, you just made him
spill his guts.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.100
Go ahead, Howard.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.110
Well, okay.

09:33.110 --> 09:35.110
I'll tell you something,
Fonzie, a long time ago,

09:35.110 --> 09:37.110
I-I had this, this
terrible problem

09:37.610 --> 09:39.950
where I, I just couldn't
get enough to eat.

09:39.950 --> 09:43.530
No matter what I did,
I could not get enough food.

09:43.530 --> 09:46.370
And then, one day,
I met the man who helped me.

09:46.370 --> 09:47.250
A farmer.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.090
I'm not gonna tell this story.

09:52.090 --> 09:55.090
Howard,
now, Howard.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.600
Howard went to
a psychologist,

09:57.600 --> 09:59.020
and he helped him
to stop eating.

09:59.020 --> 10:00.100
He did, huh?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.100
(chuckles)

10:01.100 --> 10:03.390
Yes, you should have
seen Howard then.

10:03.390 --> 10:04.470
He w-- I've
got pictures.

10:04.470 --> 10:05.470
Do you want
to see them?

10:05.470 --> 10:06.970
He was such
a jumbo!

10:06.970 --> 10:08.470
Marion!

10:08.470 --> 10:09.980
Well, they're-they're
packed away upstairs.

10:09.980 --> 10:11.480
Nobody will ever see them.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.480
I'll burn them.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.480
Is Fonzie really going
to a psychologist?

10:16.480 --> 10:18.990
You know, he's the first person
I ever knew that went to one.

10:18.990 --> 10:21.070
Well, it's a good thing
to do if you need help.

10:21.070 --> 10:22.620
Are they gonna put him
in a straitjacket?

10:22.620 --> 10:24.210
Aaayyh! Aaayyh!
Aaayyh! Aaayyh!

10:24.210 --> 10:26.210
Hey, she's just a child,
Fonz, just a child.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.210
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah,
just a child, just a child.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.330
Now, listen,

10:29.330 --> 10:30.910
I think you should
give this guy a try.

10:30.910 --> 10:31.910
I mean, if you go to him,

10:31.910 --> 10:33.420
and he doesn't help you,
what have you lost?

10:33.420 --> 10:35.380
But you've had eight
fights this week.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.970
All right, all right, I'll
tell you what we're gonna do.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.970
You're gonna go see this doctor,
you're gonna tell him

10:38.970 --> 10:39.970
it's your problem,
and you're gonna come

10:39.970 --> 10:42.430
and tell me
what he says to do.

10:42.430 --> 10:44.510
You really believe I can
go in there with this face

10:44.510 --> 10:46.100
and tell somebody
I beat people up?

10:46.100 --> 10:47.760
No.
No.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.350
All right, I'm going, I'm going.

10:49.350 --> 10:50.850
You make an appointment,
all right?

10:50.850 --> 10:53.350
I'll let this guy, uh,
mess around with my temper.

10:53.350 --> 10:55.860
But just remember,
I ain't gonna let him

10:55.860 --> 10:56.860
mess around with the good stuff!

10:57.360 --> 10:57.860
Whoa!

11:05.830 --> 11:06.870
FONZIE:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Come on, Doc,
speed this up, will you{\r}?</font></font></i>

11:06.870 --> 11:08.370
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">My friend Richie
is waiting for me outside{\r}.</font></font></i>

11:08.370 --> 11:10.950
Fonzie.

11:10.950 --> 11:13.960
Would you like to, uh,
lie down on the couch?

11:13.960 --> 11:16.210
Oh.

11:16.210 --> 11:19.800
Uh, now, Richie told me
on the phone

11:19.800 --> 11:21.300
that lately you've been
having trouble

11:21.300 --> 11:23.300
with, uh, street fighting.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.630
Lately, there's been a lot
of violence in your life.

11:25.630 --> 11:26.720
Yeah, that's right,
so just give me

11:26.720 --> 11:28.350
a pill, I'll be
on my way, right?

11:28.350 --> 11:30.940
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.530
Hey, I know that;
that was just a joke!

11:32.530 --> 11:34.640
There was a smile on my face
when I said it!

11:34.640 --> 11:35.980
Are you gonna hit me?

11:35.980 --> 11:37.060
No, I'm not gonna hit you.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.360
Good.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.450
Now, look, Fonzie,
what's the problem?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.950
I'm a psychologist;
you can say anything to me.

11:43.950 --> 11:45.820
I don't like your suit.

11:49.630 --> 11:51.580
Well, that's
a start.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.330
Do you have a girlfriend?
No.

11:55.330 --> 11:57.420
No girlfriend.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.050
I see.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.090
Uh, don't touch that, please.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.560
Uh, you know, I like
to spread myself

12:04.560 --> 12:06.560
kind of out,
you know how it is?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.060
I don't like to...
I see.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.560
Uh, don't water
that, please.

12:12.060 --> 12:15.070
So you go out with more
than one girlfriend?

12:15.070 --> 12:16.570
Yeah.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.070
No peeking, please.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.570
Well, you're a picky
little fellow, aren't you?

12:24.580 --> 12:27.580
You know, it always used
to confuse me to go out

12:27.580 --> 12:30.000
with, uh, two or three
girls at one time.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.340
You ought to try juggling 150.

12:33.340 --> 12:35.420
(chuckling):
What?

12:35.420 --> 12:37.590
150 girlfriends?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.260
Yeah, that's what I just said,
isn't it?

12:39.260 --> 12:40.880
And you believe that?

12:40.880 --> 12:42.460
Yeah, I believe that.

12:42.460 --> 12:45.010
You just asked me a question,
I gave you an answer.

12:45.010 --> 12:47.180
Why don't you lie down
on the couch?

12:47.180 --> 12:48.270
Hey, now, wait a minute.

12:48.270 --> 12:51.270
You asked me a question,
I told you the truth.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.270
All right, all right,
all right.

12:52.270 --> 12:56.280
Maybe 200-- I didn't
take inventory this week.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.780
I see.

12:57.780 --> 12:59.280
And what is
the reason

12:59.280 --> 13:01.780
for this marvelous
success with women?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.730
I'm the Fonz.

13:03.730 --> 13:05.700
That's it, you're the Fonz?

13:05.700 --> 13:07.790
That's right, I snap my fingers,
girls come running.

13:08.290 --> 13:09.790
You know... whoa!

13:11.040 --> 13:12.120
That's very
interesting.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.630
Fonzie, would you step
outside for a moment?

13:14.630 --> 13:16.630
I'd like to talk to
Richie, and, uh,

13:16.630 --> 13:18.630
if you don't mind,
don't touch anything.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.890
Hey, Cunningham,
front and center.

13:22.890 --> 13:24.890
This guy wants
to talk to you,

13:24.890 --> 13:27.390
and, uh, watch the
couch, very strange.

13:31.140 --> 13:34.230
You know, uh, you got your
friend here just in time.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.820
He's a loony bird.

13:35.820 --> 13:37.850
Well, it's all that fighting.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.440
Fighting nothing,
it's girls.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.440
Do you know he thinks

13:40.440 --> 13:42.100
that he's got
150 girlfriends?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.690
150?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.160
Yeah, well,
that's about right.

13:46.580 --> 13:47.580
And you believe it?

13:47.580 --> 13:49.080
You're caught up
in his fantasy.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.780
You think, when he snaps his
fingers, girls come running?

13:51.780 --> 13:53.370
Well, yeah,
he can do that.

13:53.370 --> 13:55.870
You're not
helping at all.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.880
Miss Franklin...
get off that desk!

14:03.880 --> 14:05.880
Control yourself,
what are you doing?

14:05.880 --> 14:07.880
Hey now, Doc,
take it easy.

14:07.880 --> 14:08.880
Take it easy, huh?

14:08.880 --> 14:10.880
She's a very
friendly chick.

14:15.390 --> 14:17.390
How did you do that?

14:17.390 --> 14:18.810
Well, I just tried
to tell you.

14:18.810 --> 14:22.390
But I've never been able
to get anywhere with her.

14:23.860 --> 14:26.400
I've wined her, I've dined her,
I gave her a job.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.950
She can't type, file
or answer the phone.

14:29.950 --> 14:31.040
You know, I've even...

14:31.040 --> 14:33.540
I've even tried
to be a father figure to her.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.410
Can... can you teach me to...
(snapping fingers)

14:36.410 --> 14:38.160
I thought we came here
to talk about <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">my problem{\r}.</font></font></i>

14:38.160 --> 14:39.750
Problems? What problems?

14:39.750 --> 14:41.300
If you can get Miss Franklin

14:41.300 --> 14:42.380
to do that...
No, look, we came here

14:42.380 --> 14:44.080
to talk about
Fonzie's fighting.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.590
Fighting? That's no problem,
I'll give you a pill.

14:46.590 --> 14:49.170
Oh, come on, Fonz,
let's go.
Now, look, all
we have to do

14:49.670 --> 14:51.170
is find an outlet
for your hostility.

14:51.170 --> 14:52.170
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

14:52.680 --> 14:53.680
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.180
It won't take any time at all.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.430
Now, look, about my bill...

14:56.430 --> 14:58.260
Hey, now, go easy on me,
I'm a working man.

14:58.260 --> 14:59.850
Uh, I'll work
something out.

14:59.850 --> 15:01.850
I'll help you, and
you'll teach me to...

15:01.850 --> 15:03.740
(snapping fingers)

15:03.740 --> 15:05.320
Well, first of all,
it ain't like this,

15:05.320 --> 15:06.770
and second of all, it
only works for me, huh?

15:06.770 --> 15:08.820
(snaps) Whoa!

15:09.280 --> 15:11.830
Yes?
I was just
practicing-- later.

what else did the doc say{\r}?</font></font></i>

15:26.380 --> 15:29.710
Well, he told him
to, uh, to build birdhouses.

15:29.710 --> 15:30.800
What are you talking about?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.770
Why would he tell the Fonz
to build birdhouses?

15:32.770 --> 15:34.350
He's supposed
to get out his...

15:34.350 --> 15:35.850
his pent up hostilities
that way.

15:35.850 --> 15:37.850
You see, he used
to get out his tension

15:37.850 --> 15:39.360
by doing a lot
of body work at the garage,

15:39.810 --> 15:40.860
but business
has been slow lately,

15:40.860 --> 15:42.860
so the doctor told him
that he's gonna

15:42.860 --> 15:44.860
have to find
something else to hit.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.860
He's gonna catch birds
and beat them up?

15:47.860 --> 15:49.870
No, hammering,
hammering!

15:49.870 --> 15:51.870
He hammers
when he builds birdhouses.

15:51.870 --> 15:53.370
It's psychology.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.370
You guys
will learn about it

15:54.370 --> 15:55.290
when you go
to college.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.630
Hi, guys.
Joanie.

15:59.630 --> 16:01.540
Joanie, what are you doing
with Fonzie's jacket?

16:01.540 --> 16:02.630
He gave it to me.

16:02.630 --> 16:03.710
You look really cute,

16:04.210 --> 16:05.750
like Leo Gorcey with freckles.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.050
(laughing)

16:07.050 --> 16:09.800
Sit on it, Ralph.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.390
Gosh, the Fonz gave
away his jacket.

16:11.390 --> 16:13.140
He must be in
pretty bad shape.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.170
All right, let's go, girls.

16:14.170 --> 16:16.930
Let's go, very gently,
very gently.

16:16.930 --> 16:18.480
I should be
in that bad of shape.

16:19.850 --> 16:20.930
What are you girls
hanging around for?

16:20.930 --> 16:22.430
We got more birdhouses
to deliver, let's go.

16:22.430 --> 16:24.100
A little dignity, let's
walk it out here,

16:24.100 --> 16:25.180
Walk it out.

16:25.180 --> 16:26.190
Hey Fonz, that...
that's...

16:26.190 --> 16:27.820
that's a nice
shirt you got on.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.770
Oh, yeah, blue, see,
very peaceful, very peaceful.

16:36.030 --> 16:37.110
There he is.

16:37.110 --> 16:39.620
The guy with the funny
blue shirt on.

16:39.620 --> 16:42.620
That's the guy
who beat you up?
Yeah.

16:42.620 --> 16:46.090
The guy playing
with the dollhouse?

16:46.090 --> 16:48.960
He looked a lot tougher
with his leather jacket on.

16:48.960 --> 16:53.010
Uh, they couldn't possibly
be talking about me.

16:53.010 --> 16:56.770
Well, I think they are,
but just remember: control.

16:56.770 --> 16:59.130
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
the Fonz is in control.

16:59.130 --> 17:01.220
Yeah, you.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.770
I'm Butch.

17:02.770 --> 17:03.690
Hi, Butch.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.530
Bernie's brother.

17:07.030 --> 17:08.310
I've come to
settle the score.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.400
Oh, no, no, I don't think
that's necessary.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.900
You see, look, I apologize
for busting up Bernie here.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.400
I lost a little control there.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.900
How about if I make you
a birdhouse, huh?

17:15.900 --> 17:17.319
What color do you want?

17:17.319 --> 17:20.410
This is what I think
of your birdhouse.

17:23.790 --> 17:24.960
Fonz.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.050
Oh, oh, it's all right.

17:26.050 --> 17:27.050
I just got a pinched nerve.

17:27.050 --> 17:29.050
(suppressed growling)

17:29.050 --> 17:32.050
I am in control.

17:32.050 --> 17:34.550
No, I don't think we're gonna
discuss this right now

17:34.550 --> 17:37.560
since we seem to be a little hot
under the collar.

17:37.560 --> 17:41.560
And besides that, I got a date
with the Polaski twins.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.850
I made them a set
of matching birdhouses.

17:45.180 --> 17:47.180
(groans)

17:49.180 --> 17:51.690
(Fonzie groaning)

18:01.110 --> 18:02.750
Mr. C,

18:02.750 --> 18:04.330
I got this down to a science.

18:04.330 --> 18:05.830
I can build a birdhouse
in five minutes.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.340
I want to
talk to you.
Watch this.

18:07.340 --> 18:08.840
You can talk to me
while I'm hammering, all right?

18:09.340 --> 18:10.340
Wait! Not
on my table.
Marion...

18:10.340 --> 18:11.840
Keep going,
I can't hear you.
No, no,

18:11.840 --> 18:13.340
I want to talk to you
about these bird things.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.340
Talk it up, talk it up.
Wait a minute!

18:15.340 --> 18:18.350
I want to talk to you about
these blasted birdhouses!

18:18.350 --> 18:19.850
Why is he yelling at me?

18:19.850 --> 18:21.350
Oh, Howard,
you're just upset

18:21.350 --> 18:22.350
about all
the hammering.

18:22.350 --> 18:24.800
Would you like
to go upstairs?

18:24.800 --> 18:27.390
I'm not in the
mood, Marion.

18:30.890 --> 18:32.900
I'm going out
and get a paper.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.400
But, Howard,
I have a chicken in the oven.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.480
Let him get
his own paper.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.370
Now, what's up
with big H?

18:40.370 --> 18:41.950
Oh, it's just
that Howard and I

18:41.950 --> 18:44.460
are very worried
about you.
Why is that?

18:44.460 --> 18:45.960
Well, it-it's not
like you to...
(banging)

18:45.960 --> 18:48.460
stay up in your room
for a whole week.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.000
I've done that before.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.460
Not alone.

18:51.460 --> 18:53.050
Hey, true, huh?

18:53.550 --> 18:56.050
Hey, what is Alfred's
birdhouse doing here?

18:56.050 --> 18:58.050
Oh, he sent it
over to be fixed.

18:58.050 --> 19:00.060
You see that, I told you
he'd like it, huh?

19:00.060 --> 19:01.810
'Cause he knew you were
afraid to his place.

19:01.810 --> 19:03.760
Afraid? Is that what
everybody's saying-- afraid?

19:03.760 --> 19:05.980
Yeah, 'cause those guys
chased you out last week.

19:05.980 --> 19:07.560
Chased? Well, I'll just
go right down there

19:07.560 --> 19:09.060
and fix it in
front of him.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.230
Hey, Fonz, you gonna
pound those guys?

19:11.230 --> 19:12.320
Hey, hey, hey,
Shortcake,

19:12.320 --> 19:14.320
there is no
reason to fight.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.820
You can talk your way
out of any fight.

19:16.820 --> 19:19.320
You know what the
key is? Control.

19:19.830 --> 19:23.330
You know, Joanie, you look
really cute in my jacket,

19:23.330 --> 19:26.330
but there is a, uh,
spot on my sleeve

19:26.330 --> 19:27.830
which I'm sure that
you will clean.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.840
There is a spot on the
sleeve of my jacket.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.340
I am in control.

19:31.840 --> 19:32.840
Everything is
in control.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.840
There's a spot
on my jacket.

19:42.930 --> 19:44.970
FONZIE:
Okay, now, that's gonna hold it
right there, see that?

19:47.020 --> 19:49.220
Great.

19:49.220 --> 19:50.810
You know, I think
I'm making a lot

19:50.810 --> 19:52.310
of people uncomfortable
here today.

19:52.310 --> 19:53.810
Well, you just got
to understand

19:53.810 --> 19:55.310
that people aren't used
to seeing the Fonz

19:55.310 --> 19:56.280
under complete control.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.310
Hey, I can dig that.

19:57.310 --> 19:59.200
Yeah.
Hey, okay.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.650
Hey, look who's here.

20:02.650 --> 20:04.240
Oh, hi, Butch,
hi, Bernie.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.070
Huh, huh, huh?

20:07.910 --> 20:11.410
Building any
dollhouses lately?

20:11.410 --> 20:13.910
Uh... I'm going up,
Cunningham.

20:13.910 --> 20:15.910
Come on down,
Fonz.
Okay, I'm coming down.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.420
I'm coming down.
You're doing good.

20:17.420 --> 20:20.000
I never thought
I'd see him again.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.500
They must have given him
the day off

20:21.500 --> 20:24.010
at the chicken coop.
(chuckling)

20:24.010 --> 20:25.510
(clucking like a chicken)

20:25.510 --> 20:27.560
BUTCH:
Aw...

20:27.560 --> 20:29.650
Look at his little
dollhouse.

20:29.650 --> 20:30.650
Aw.

20:30.650 --> 20:32.560
Show us how you play.

20:35.020 --> 20:36.020
Cunningham?

20:36.020 --> 20:37.020
It's just talk, Fonz.

20:37.020 --> 20:39.020
It's just talk,
it's just talk.
Yeah.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.160
Hey, dollhouse man,
while you're sitting there,

20:44.160 --> 20:46.660
why don't you shine
my shoes?

20:46.660 --> 20:48.160
(Fonzie groaning)

20:48.160 --> 20:49.670
Fonz!

20:49.670 --> 20:52.170
I-I-I'm just going
for a walk.

20:52.170 --> 20:53.670
I'm just going
for a walk, Richie.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.170
I'll tell you when
you can leave.

20:59.630 --> 21:00.960
Uh, Richie, uh...?

21:02.790 --> 21:03.880
Get him.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.960
Yeah.
(snaps fingers)

21:05.960 --> 21:07.470
Shortcake!

21:08.470 --> 21:10.970
Whoa, am I sorry
you touched me!

21:10.970 --> 21:12.470
'Cause, you know,
when I get touched,

21:12.470 --> 21:14.470
I feel like pounding,

21:14.470 --> 21:15.470
I feel like...
like hitting,

21:15.470 --> 21:16.980
I feel like ripping,
you know, like...

21:19.730 --> 21:22.450
Now, that could have
been your head, gentlemen.

21:22.450 --> 21:25.530
Now, that's the guy
I was talking about.

21:25.530 --> 21:27.040
What are you getting
so hot about?

21:27.040 --> 21:28.990
You apologized.

21:28.990 --> 21:30.570
Yeah, yeah, I
apologized.

21:30.570 --> 21:32.620
Get over here,
get over here.

21:32.620 --> 21:33.990
BUTCH:
We apologized.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.080
You apologized.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.580
We were only kidding.

21:36.580 --> 21:39.080
Oh, yeah,
well, I wasn't kidding.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.300
Just hold your ground.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.800
I am not going
to hurt them.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.310
I am not hurting them,
I am in control.

21:46.310 --> 21:47.310
(shouts)

21:47.310 --> 21:49.810
Just kidding,
just kidding, huh?

21:54.310 --> 21:55.810
All right,
all right, what?

21:55.810 --> 21:56.820
Can we go now?

21:56.820 --> 21:58.320
Yeah, you can go now.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.820
Hey.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.820
Why don't you run?

22:02.820 --> 22:05.320
(crowd cheering)

22:09.030 --> 22:11.580
I want to talk to you
for a minute, Cunningham.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.120
I was in perfect
control.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.620
You know, that
was your fault.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.120
You went bananas
over there

22:16.120 --> 22:18.450
with "Get him,"
you understand?

22:18.450 --> 22:19.540
Well, yeah,
but I wouldn't want

22:19.540 --> 22:20.870
people to
push you around.

22:20.870 --> 22:21.960
I'm not too crazy
about that,

22:21.960 --> 22:23.010
either, let
me tell you.

22:23.010 --> 22:24.590
I mean, the guy
got physical, right?

22:24.590 --> 22:26.130
And you had
to draw the line.

22:26.130 --> 22:27.210
I drew it pretty
well, huh?

22:27.210 --> 22:28.510
Yeah.
Yeah.

22:28.510 --> 22:30.100
And then, you let them
off the hook.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.050
You proved that talking
is better than punching.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.440
That's 'cause I'm ahead
of my time, Cunningham.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.520
Right.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.520
And Fonz?
Yeah?

22:36.520 --> 22:37.810
That's why I
was proud of you.

22:37.810 --> 22:39.390
Oh, you're proud now.

22:39.390 --> 22:41.390
Well, that's different than
disappointed, ain't it?

22:41.390 --> 22:42.890
All right, I'm
okay now, right?
Yeah.

22:42.890 --> 22:43.900
No more shrinks,

22:44.400 --> 22:46.400
no more birdhouses.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.400
Well, maybe I'll just
fix this one, you know?

22:49.400 --> 22:51.400
Oh, yeah, I'll help
you carry it home.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.410
What has she got
in my pockets here?

22:54.410 --> 22:58.410
Lipstick, compact,
what is this?

22:58.410 --> 22:59.380
Oh.
(chuckling)

22:59.380 --> 23:01.410
She put taffy in
your pocket, too.

23:01.410 --> 23:04.420
Cunningham,
the taffy is mine.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.920
Hey, Shortcake!

23:21.480 --> 23:23.490
ALFRED:
All right, everybody out.

23:23.490 --> 23:24.990
We're closing, closing up.
(disappointed groans)

23:24.990 --> 23:26.990
FONZIE:
Hey, Alfred, Alfred,
what is the rush?

23:26.990 --> 23:28.490
Oh, hey, Fonz, stick around
a little bit, will you?

23:28.490 --> 23:29.490
I want to talk to you.

23:29.490 --> 23:31.990
Okay, good night.

23:31.990 --> 23:34.000
Hey, uh, come on Fonz,
the girls are in a hurry.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Yeah, right, I'll
be right there.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Wait for me, right?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Look, Fonz,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.500
listen, I... I want
to thank you

23:40.500 --> 23:42.420
for setting me up
with Choo Choo.

23:43.870 --> 23:44.870
It was my pleasure--
I figured

23:44.870 --> 23:46.590
you'd like her better
than a birdhouse.

23:46.590 --> 23:48.180
Well, no, the birdhouse
was nice.

23:48.180 --> 23:49.180
Yeah, wasn't it?

23:49.180 --> 23:50.960
Not as nice as...

23:50.960 --> 23:51.960
FONZIE:
Hey, I can dig it.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.050
I can dig it.
Hey, Fonz,

23:53.050 --> 23:54.470
would you give me
a few tips?

23:54.470 --> 23:56.050
Oh, yeah, come
here, Alfred.

23:58.050 --> 24:01.060
To start off,
start dancing with her.

24:01.060 --> 24:03.360
It gets her blood up,
you know what I mean?

24:03.360 --> 24:04.440
ALFRED:
All right, yeah.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.890
Hey, Fonz,
would you mind hurrying up?

24:05.890 --> 24:06.950
She's blowing
in my ear,

24:06.950 --> 24:09.450
and we're not even
to the car yet.

24:09.450 --> 24:12.450
Control, Cunningham,
control.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.950
Let me tell you, this
is no time for control.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.120
Look at that.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.710
My teacher
is in a rush, huh?

24:18.710 --> 24:19.710
All right, hey, hey, hey.

24:19.710 --> 24:22.210
Come on, man,
this dance is on me.
