WEBVTT

00:12.250 --> 00:13.834
-(APPLAUSE)
-BILL: Hey, the congressman
is back.

00:14.917 --> 00:17.291
Okay, all right.
So here are the questions.

00:17.375 --> 00:19.667
Jon Meacham,
does the Post-Civil War era

00:19.750 --> 00:21.667
offer any lessons on
how to seize upon

00:21.750 --> 00:24.792
a post-Trump era to enact
real, lasting

00:24.875 --> 00:26.500
political and social
reform?

00:26.583 --> 00:27.583
-(AUDIENCE TITTERS)
-BILL: Oh. We're--

00:27.667 --> 00:29.000
We're in reconstruction times,

00:29.083 --> 00:30.208
-already, with--
-JON: Yeah...

00:30.417 --> 00:32.834
-Uh, not really, unfortunately.
-(BILL LAUGHS)

00:32.917 --> 00:35.625
Uh, because reconstruction
really was a prelude

00:35.709 --> 00:38.333
to a century where
we were still fighting Jim Crow,

00:38.542 --> 00:39.750
and, uh...

00:40.000 --> 00:42.417
U.S. Grant got a couple
of things right.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.709
Uh, he fought against the Klan,
and that was important.

00:45.792 --> 00:48.083
It didn't resu--
it didn't come back
until the '20s.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.709
But-- The Justice Department
was founded, actually,

00:50.792 --> 00:53.500
to fight the Klan
for the first time in the 1870s.

00:54.041 --> 00:56.041
I do think this is like
reconstruction in that

00:56.125 --> 00:58.291
the most analogous president

00:58.375 --> 01:00.041
which is, like saying
you're the best restaurant

01:00.125 --> 01:02.041
in the hospital, you know,
it's a small category,

01:02.125 --> 01:03.875
-is, uh...
-(LAUGHTER)

01:03.959 --> 01:06.291
...is in fact Andrew Johnson,
because Johnson--

01:06.375 --> 01:08.250
-BILL: Oh, yeah, he was...
horrible.
-Johnson was trying

01:08.333 --> 01:10.834
to undo the verdict of the war,
and was doing so...

01:10.917 --> 01:13.041
-BILL: And they impeached him,
so let's--
-And they impeached him, yeah.

01:13.125 --> 01:14.542
let's get on with
the impeachment. Okay.

01:14.625 --> 01:16.208
-(SCATTERED LAUGHTER
AND APPLAUSE)
-Uh, Will,

01:16.291 --> 01:18.875
you voted against
a resolution to request

01:18.959 --> 01:21.458
the president's tax returns.
You did?

01:21.875 --> 01:23.333
-It was--
-(BILL LAUGHS)

01:23.417 --> 01:24.583
-Come on, Will.
-No. No.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.875
-DE BLASIO: Man.
-Do you believe that--

01:26.959 --> 01:28.583
There wasn't an actual
resolution for it.

01:28.667 --> 01:31.208
-Oh.
-But it was probably
a vote-- a motion to table.

01:31.291 --> 01:32.583
But if it comes back on,
let me--

01:32.667 --> 01:34.041
I'm sure I know where
the question's going.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.417
-I think we should see
the president's...
-(CHUCKLES) Well--

01:36.500 --> 01:38.417
-...tax returns.
-Oh, good. Yeah, see?

01:38.500 --> 01:40.000
-(APPLAUSE)
-That's why you--

01:40.083 --> 01:41.125
DE BLASIO: All right!

01:41.208 --> 01:43.208
That's why we bring
Republicans here.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.250
We bring 'em to the--
You know, we bring 'em to the--

01:45.333 --> 01:46.792
-JON: Like day therapy.
-We run-- That's right.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.000
-(PANEL LAUGHS)
-Exactly!

01:48.083 --> 01:49.709
-JENNIFER: But this one worked.
-BILL: Right, okay.

01:49.792 --> 01:52.458
Jennifer, what do you make
of the Senate's latest
warming against--

01:52.667 --> 01:55.750
uh, warning against
precipitous withdrawal
from Syria?

01:55.959 --> 01:58.250
Does this signal a shift
in Republican pushback

01:58.333 --> 02:00.125
against Trump's foreign
policies?

02:00.333 --> 02:03.417
Listen, whatever they can do
is more than they have
been doing,

02:03.500 --> 02:04.834
which is exactly nothing.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.375
So every little bit
should be encouraged.

02:07.458 --> 02:11.667
Now, perhaps, they can start
pushing back
on things like the wall,

02:11.750 --> 02:16.208
on things like his non-existent
victory over ISIS.

02:16.291 --> 02:19.083
So, if they can smart--
start in small ways,

02:19.166 --> 02:21.458
hopefully this will become
a pattern and a trend.

02:21.792 --> 02:26.583
I think what is interesting
is that they're no longer
completely cowed by this guy.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.917
That they have some inkling
of independence,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.125
some sense of self--
you know, survival, maybe.

02:32.208 --> 02:34.000
Um, so this is a good thing.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.959
I don't think it's gonna be
enough, frankly,

02:36.041 --> 02:38.166
to save a bunch of 'em
in 2020.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.250
Someone like Cory Gardner,
he's kaput. Um...

02:41.333 --> 02:43.792
But, hey, if they wanna start,
and they wanna start

02:43.875 --> 02:46.417
actually taking
the job seriously,
that would be great.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.625
Jennifer, don't you think
they should go the next step

02:48.709 --> 02:52.500
and actually decide
and vote to authorize
our military actions,

02:52.583 --> 02:54.083
rather than just letting
them happen?

02:54.166 --> 02:55.792
Oh, well, you gotta go
back to the constitution,

02:55.875 --> 02:57.667
-and everything-- Okay.
-Right. I mean, this is--
this is--

02:57.750 --> 02:59.667
I hope this leads to
a bigger discussion.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.291
With all due respect to
the congressmen,

03:01.375 --> 03:03.333
where's the War Powers Act
when you need it?

03:03.417 --> 03:05.709
All these wars have happened
without congressional
authorization,

03:05.792 --> 03:07.834
and somehow the congress
is not clamoring...

03:07.917 --> 03:09.667
-That's a bi-par-- That was
a bi partisan...
-...to make that decision.

03:09.750 --> 03:10.959
-JENNIFER: Yes.
-(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

03:11.041 --> 03:12.834
-...to give up that. They--
-JON: You know the last--

03:12.917 --> 03:14.542
The last time we declared war
was?

03:14.625 --> 03:15.709
-BILL: Right.
-WILL: 2001?

03:15.792 --> 03:17.125
-BILL: Way--
-It was not even Vietnam.

03:17.208 --> 03:18.208
-World War Two.
-Authorizing-- Yeah.

03:18.750 --> 03:21.000
WILL: Because if you--
You actually don't want
to declare war, right?

03:21.083 --> 03:23.959
-No.
-Because when you declare war,
that means the president gets

03:24.041 --> 03:25.834
these-- all these powers
here in the United States.

03:25.917 --> 03:28.375
That's why it's the authorized
use of military force.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.083
-That-- That's the--
-JENNIFER: Maybe we should
clean up

03:30.166 --> 03:31.750
-those rules too.
-DE BLASIO: it's so open-ended
right now.

03:31.834 --> 03:33.583
Since we've discovered now
a whole bunch of

03:33.667 --> 03:35.083
-these emergency powers...
-JON: Oh, God.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.041
...which sounds like, you know--
These things are still
on the books,

03:38.125 --> 03:39.834
some of them have been
on the books for 60 years,

03:39.917 --> 03:41.291
we don't even know
what they are.

03:41.375 --> 03:44.417
So, to the mayor's point,
it used to be, like,

03:44.500 --> 03:47.500
back when I was a member of
the Republican party,
in the deep dark ages,

03:47.583 --> 03:48.834
that the Republican party

03:49.458 --> 03:51.083
-was against executive power.
-JON: With all respect,
wasn't that like two years ago?

03:51.166 --> 03:53.041
-PETER: Yeah, it was like 2012.
-You know-- It seems like--

03:53.125 --> 03:55.000
-It's in dog years.
-I mean, let's not-- You know.

03:55.083 --> 03:57.542
So that's like, you know--
In dog years, it's a lifetime.

03:57.625 --> 03:59.333
-JON: No. Sorry.
-So, it used to be the party

03:59.417 --> 04:01.750
that didn't like
executive power,

04:01.834 --> 04:05.792
it used to be the--
Paul Ryan would give speeches
about congressmen...

04:05.875 --> 04:07.542
-BILL: Right.
-...covering the power
of the purse.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.583
-That's when Obama
was president. Come on.
-Yeah, exactly.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.583
It's completely different
when I see it the other way
around.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.125
You think George W. Bush
was saying that?

04:13.208 --> 04:14.417
-Right, right. Right.
-No, no, no. It's all--

04:14.792 --> 04:17.125
-People always hate executive
power until they have it.
-Right. But--

04:17.208 --> 04:19.083
Both parties did this.
Let's be clear.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.917
-JENNIFER: Yes.
-Both parties in the Congress

04:21.000 --> 04:22.750
have stepped away
from the responsibility,

04:22.834 --> 04:24.333
left it to the president.

04:24.417 --> 04:27.166
And this is something
we should be asking questions
about, as Americans.

04:27.375 --> 04:30.083
Why are-- Why were we
in Saudi Arabia?

04:30.333 --> 04:33.959
Why-- I actually mean Yemen.
Why were we backing
Saudi Arabia in Yemen?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.959
Why were we part of
a humanitarian crisis?

04:36.166 --> 04:39.375
Why were our tax dollars
killing families and children?

04:39.458 --> 04:42.667
And the congress said nothing
until very recently.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.417
Something's wrong
with that equation.

04:44.667 --> 04:46.041
Two points here. Um,

04:46.125 --> 04:49.625
I think Jennifer is
absolutely right that
Congress, in the past,

04:49.709 --> 04:53.375
and again, I've only been
in congress for four years,
so I use that past tense,

04:53.583 --> 04:57.333
um, has given power
to the executive branch. The--

04:57.417 --> 04:59.875
Congress is supposed to be
a co-equal branch of government,

04:59.959 --> 05:02.000
and that's where
they've given too much up,

05:02.083 --> 05:05.709
and that's-- We're trying
to claw some of that back.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.333
There was a vote earlier
this week,

05:07.417 --> 05:09.458
about saying our support
for NATO--

05:09.667 --> 05:13.709
Because NATO has, you know,
been responsible for 70 years
of peace and prosperity.

05:13.792 --> 05:16.625
We're in Yemen because
the Iranians were creating

05:16.709 --> 05:19.458
a humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

05:19.542 --> 05:22.875
-Right? And so-- so--
-There was no vote
by the congress

05:22.959 --> 05:26.125
to authorize military support
for Saudi Arabia,

05:26.208 --> 05:29.709
and we know that
Saudi Arabia exacerbated
the humanitarian crisis.

05:29.792 --> 05:33.125
There was no actual debate
and vote, and that's dangerous.

05:33.208 --> 05:36.291
What do you think about the--
Trump getting a guy

05:36.375 --> 05:40.000
to pass over 30 people
to get security clearance,

05:40.083 --> 05:42.625
who the experts said shouldn't
have security clearance?

05:43.750 --> 05:46.125
-JON: Kushner.
-(STAMMERS) Someone who has--

05:46.208 --> 05:51.041
Jared Kushner-- 30 people
who went through
the normal channels,

05:51.250 --> 05:54.250
which, at the top levels
is the-- is the CIA.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.000
And they said, "No,
are you kidding?"

05:56.083 --> 05:57.917
These-- These are white collar
criminals. They can't--

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
-They can't have
security clearance."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

06:00.083 --> 06:01.417
They're up to their necks
with other c--

06:01.500 --> 06:03.834
And-- And-- He found
some stooge to say,

06:04.041 --> 06:05.583
"Oh, no. You have security
clearance."

06:05.667 --> 06:09.041
I-- I'm pretty confident
that the distinguished
gentleman

06:09.125 --> 06:12.333
from the state of Maryland,
uh, Chairman Elijah Cummings

06:12.417 --> 06:14.333
will be investigating
that process.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.333
-(APPLAUSE)
-BILL: And he should.
He should.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.291
-(APPLAUSE)
-BILL: Okay, good.

06:19.125 --> 06:22.458
-(BILL LAUGHS)
-You're sounding more
like a Democrat every day.

06:22.709 --> 06:24.542
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

06:24.625 --> 06:26.291
Let's keep him here all night!

06:26.625 --> 06:29.333
Can we-- Can we--
Can we add another new rule,

06:29.417 --> 06:30.625
-Bill? Like--
-BILL: Yes. Yes.

06:30.709 --> 06:34.458
Here's-- What's always funny
is when we actually agree.

06:34.542 --> 06:37.709
When one person of one party
agrees with someone
in the other party,

06:37.792 --> 06:39.875
we always say,
"Be more like me." Right?

06:39.959 --> 06:43.000
But can't we just say, for once,
"Hey, we're actually
in agreement,"

06:43.083 --> 06:45.583
because making sure
we have two strong parties

06:45.667 --> 06:46.667
is important to this country.

06:47.125 --> 06:49.875
The competition of ideas
is what made-- has made
this country--

06:49.959 --> 06:52.750
Okay, but one party
is enabling Donald Trump.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.709
And one party
is enabling all these things
that we're talking about.

06:55.792 --> 06:59.792
The fact that he's able
to get away with giving
security clearances

06:59.875 --> 07:01.333
to people who don't deserve
them

07:01.750 --> 07:06.333
is because the Republican party
as a whole is not standing up
to him, and is allowing--

07:06.417 --> 07:08.667
The reason why he gets away with
having meetings with Putin

07:08.875 --> 07:10.417
and nobody gets to take notes.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.959
I mean, what goes on
in these meetings with Putin?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.083
It's the Republican party,
it's not a bi-partisan
endeavor

07:16.166 --> 07:17.917
-why he's able to
get away with this.
-JENNIFER: Right.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.208
And that's why many of us
who were in the Republican Party
said they have to lose.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.417
They have to lose really badly,

07:24.500 --> 07:26.250
so that they will either--

07:26.333 --> 07:29.417
They'll either start over,
or some other party
will come up,

07:29.500 --> 07:33.792
but you can't have a party
that has lost its mind--
and lost all...

07:33.875 --> 07:36.375
Okay. May-- Mr. Mayor,
were you surprised to learn

07:36.458 --> 07:39.125
that the Trump Foundation
is being forced to dissolve

07:39.208 --> 07:42.458
after allegedly engaging
in a shocking pattern
of illegality?

07:42.542 --> 07:44.125
-The Trump Found--
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

07:44.208 --> 07:45.542
-BILL: I mean...
-(JENNIFER LAUGHS)

07:45.625 --> 07:46.709
-Bill...
-(BILL LAUGHS)

07:46.792 --> 07:48.667
-I have to say...
-(PANEL LAUGHS)

07:48.750 --> 07:52.458
I did not recover from
that report, it was so shocking
to me. No. This is everything--

07:52.542 --> 07:54.834
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-The guy has been a conman--

07:54.917 --> 07:57.208
What's amazing is back
in the 1980s...

07:57.291 --> 07:59.959
-BILL: Yeah.
-when-- And he's
done disgusting--

08:00.041 --> 08:02.625
You know, he called for
the execution...

08:02.709 --> 08:05.625
-BILL: Yes.
-...of five young men
in the Central Park Five case,

08:05.709 --> 08:07.625
-who were proven innocent.
-BILL: Right.

08:07.709 --> 08:10.333
He took out full page ads
that called for their execution.

08:10.417 --> 08:12.125
This guy-- He has stiffed
his workers

08:12.208 --> 08:14.792
every step along the way
in the hotel industry.

08:14.875 --> 08:18.625
He's a conman
who got away with it
for decades.

08:18.709 --> 08:20.709
-And now he's--
-He's not gonna get away with is
this time.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.250
-(APPLAUSE)
-I hope not. Okay.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.458
-We'll leave it on that.
-(CHEERING)

08:23.542 --> 08:26.041
Thank you very much.
Thank you, audience.
