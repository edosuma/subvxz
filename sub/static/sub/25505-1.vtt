No, I don't, Officer.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.554
Turn that radio off, please.

01:47.556 --> 01:50.858
That's not the radio.
That's the band practicing.

01:54.997 --> 01:56.328
Is that marijuana?

01:57.465 --> 01:59.232
You got a party bowl up there?

01:59.234 --> 02:00.334
Mm, nah.

02:00.336 --> 02:03.170
It's okay, it's okay.
Is it good?

02:03.172 --> 02:04.170
Mm.

02:04.172 --> 02:08.441
Yeah. Open it up!
I'm fucking boarding you!

02:08.443 --> 02:11.577
5-0!
5-0 coming on board.

02:11.579 --> 02:13.747
Officer, you can't
just waltz on in here!

02:13.749 --> 02:15.281
Do you know
who these guys are?

02:15.283 --> 02:17.483
Unplug this shit right now.

02:19.019 --> 02:20.489
No way.

02:21.357 --> 02:22.922
No fucking way.

Holy shit!

02:36.670 --> 02:37.938
You guys are the highway cops

02:37.940 --> 02:40.340
that got shut down
and became local cops.

02:40.342 --> 02:42.676
Then due to some
kinda crazy "incident"...

02:42.678 --> 02:44.543
you got kicked off
of that force,

02:44.545 --> 02:45.911
so you started playing music.

02:45.913 --> 02:48.684
And before you knew it,
you won America's Got Talent.

02:49.418 --> 02:51.017
You're Cracklin' Bacon!

02:51.019 --> 02:53.352
What a long,
strange trip it's been.

02:53.354 --> 02:54.754
I love you guys!

02:54.756 --> 02:56.655
Oh, I gotta tell my partner.

02:56.657 --> 02:58.257
He's not gonna believe this!
Okay, hold on.

02:58.259 --> 03:00.426
- Dude, you gotta get over here right now.
- <i>Copy.</i>

03:00.428 --> 03:01.494
He's gonna shit his pants.

03:01.496 --> 03:02.629
You know what
would be hilarious?

03:02.631 --> 03:03.730
When he comes on the bus,

03:03.732 --> 03:05.298
kick him in the nuts
as hard as you can.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.966
- Really?
- Just drill the guy!

03:06.968 --> 03:08.735
What the hell
is going on in here?

03:15.109 --> 03:18.911
Oh, my God!
You're Cracklin' Bacon!

03:18.913 --> 03:20.814
You guys are my favorite band,
like, ever!

03:20.816 --> 03:23.315
What? You didn't even know
who Cracklin' Bacon was...

03:23.317 --> 03:24.384
until I played them
for you.

03:24.386 --> 03:25.452
Yeah, I did!

03:25.454 --> 03:26.987
Oh, really?
What's your favorite song?

03:26.989 --> 03:27.854
"Pulled Pork."

03:27.856 --> 03:29.555
- Yeah? How does it go then?
- Uh...

03:29.557 --> 03:32.426
<i>♪ I'm gonna eat you
like a pulled pork sandwich ♪</i>

03:32.428 --> 03:35.529
<i>♪ Get inside your bread
like a hot steak Manwich ♪</i>

03:37.365 --> 03:38.832
This guy's got some pipes!

03:38.834 --> 03:41.767
Hey, how would you like
to join Cracklin' Bacon?

03:41.769 --> 03:43.269
We're looking
for a new lead singer.

03:43.271 --> 03:44.438
Holy shit!

03:44.440 --> 03:46.305
Yeah, oh, I can do it
better than him.

03:46.307 --> 03:49.108
<i>♪ I'm gonna eat you

03:49.110 --> 03:53.213
<i>♪ Kung Fu you
like a Jackie Chan-wich ♪</i>

03:53.215 --> 03:54.446
Not bad.

03:55.517 --> 03:57.017
You guys clearly
have the sound.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.585
But do you have the moves?
Hit it.

04:01.423 --> 04:03.756
Fist-pumps!

04:03.758 --> 04:05.826
Pelvic thrusts.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.327
Shake your tail feathers.

04:07.329 --> 04:08.629
Shake that ass.

04:08.631 --> 04:09.729
Now kiss each other.

04:09.731 --> 04:10.898
I'm sorry. Come again?

04:10.900 --> 04:12.565
Come on, rock and roll!
Rock and roll, baby!

04:12.567 --> 04:13.899
- Do it!
- Kiss him!

04:13.901 --> 04:16.303
Kiss him! Kiss him!
Kiss him! Kiss him!

04:23.345 --> 04:24.677
I knew
you were fucking with us.

04:24.679 --> 04:25.978
You're fucking
with us, man!

04:25.980 --> 04:27.780
All right, all right.
You guys clearly have

04:27.782 --> 04:29.115
what it takes
for rock and roll.

04:29.117 --> 04:31.217
But there's one more test
you gotta pass

04:31.219 --> 04:33.819
before we let you
join Cracklin' Bacon.

04:33.821 --> 04:37.557
We wanna know if you can
keep up with Juicy Lucy.

04:38.693 --> 04:40.559
She looks
pretty juicy to me.

04:40.561 --> 04:41.660
Oh, no, she's
in the back, okay?

04:41.662 --> 04:43.698
But I warn you,
she can be quite a handful.

04:44.599 --> 04:46.098
Let's go handle that!

04:46.100 --> 04:49.369
Juicy Lucy!
Juicy Lucy! Juicy Lucy!

04:49.371 --> 04:51.707
About to get juicy up in here!

04:52.374 --> 04:53.639
Hey, baby.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.008
Hello, Juicy Lucy.

04:55.010 --> 04:57.744
Oh, that's not Lucy.
Lucy's better.

04:57.746 --> 04:59.215
Oh, man!

05:00.715 --> 05:02.348
Fellas, on the other side
of this door

05:02.350 --> 05:05.585
is everlasting fame and glory.

05:05.587 --> 05:08.655
You get the giney,
I'll get the hiney.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.429
Say hello to Lucy!

05:16.631 --> 05:18.499
Move it or lose it!
It's time to cruise it!

05:18.501 --> 05:19.633
Let's do it!

05:21.136 --> 05:22.468
Motherfucker!

05:32.047 --> 05:33.879
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- Crap damnit!

05:33.881 --> 05:37.150
We sang our hearts off
for those guys. Our hearts!

05:42.256 --> 05:43.358
We got company.

05:51.633 --> 05:53.934
Can't outrun the law,
motherfucker!

05:53.936 --> 05:57.569
<i>♪ Don't hesitate,

05:57.571 --> 06:00.506
Fuck you, Cracklin' Bacon!

06:00.508 --> 06:01.807
Whoa!

06:08.015 --> 06:09.117
Oh, shit!

06:13.455 --> 06:14.789
Motherfucker.

06:15.991 --> 06:17.557
Eat it. Eat it.
Eat it. Eat it.

06:21.095 --> 06:22.363
Ah.

06:28.936 --> 06:30.802
Suck these
fucking bullets, bitch!

06:37.946 --> 06:40.614
Oh, shit! Mac. Hey,
stay with me. Stay with me.

06:40.616 --> 06:44.453
We almost got
those stupid cops...

06:46.888 --> 06:49.024
- ...to kiss.
- Shit.

06:53.528 --> 06:54.796
What's that?

06:55.763 --> 06:56.965
What the...

06:57.532 --> 06:59.134
Whoa!

07:08.143 --> 07:09.145
Shit!

07:11.647 --> 07:13.015
Hey.

07:13.914 --> 07:15.682
I still love those guys.

07:15.684 --> 07:17.650
Yeah, they're cool as hell.

07:17.652 --> 07:19.151
I mean, look at him.

07:19.153 --> 07:20.155
Still cool.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.523
We should probably hide
that body, though.

07:23.525 --> 07:24.527
Yeah.

07:26.128 --> 07:27.930
Hey, great driving, Thorn!

07:28.362 --> 07:29.996
Thorny? Thorny?

07:29.998 --> 07:31.730
Oh, my God! He's dead!

07:31.732 --> 07:33.165
- Oh, no!
- Ha-ha!

07:33.167 --> 07:34.734
- Aha!
- I got you, motherfucker!

07:36.104 --> 07:38.841
- I'm not dead! I'm alive!
- He's alive!

07:39.540 --> 07:40.542
Look out!

07:41.275 --> 07:42.643
Holy...

07:54.556 --> 07:56.592
Ahhh!

08:05.032 --> 08:07.100
You sleeping, baby boy?

08:07.102 --> 08:09.335
No, I'm just checking out
the ceiling, Farva.

08:09.337 --> 08:10.470
Good work up there.

08:10.472 --> 08:12.304
All right, pull out your caulk
and let's go.

08:12.306 --> 08:13.439
What?

08:13.441 --> 08:15.775
Let's go! I'm standing here
with my caulk in my hand.

08:15.777 --> 08:17.276
Grab your caulk,
let's put it in the holes!

08:17.278 --> 08:18.545
Come on, let me see
that big caulk.

08:18.547 --> 08:19.645
Oh, shut up.

08:19.647 --> 08:20.946
Show me your Rabbit caulk!

08:20.948 --> 08:22.014
You know
what's funny, Farva?

08:22.016 --> 08:23.583
You've made that joke
400 times

08:23.585 --> 08:24.751
and it still sucks.

08:24.753 --> 08:25.951
Fuck you, Mac.

08:25.953 --> 08:27.386
You don't talk to your
site supervisor like that.

08:27.388 --> 08:29.489
That's one demerit
on your permanent record.

08:29.491 --> 08:31.456
On my permanent
construction record?

08:31.458 --> 08:33.058
That's right. You want
another one, keep it up.

08:33.061 --> 08:34.426
Yeah, give me another
and I'll pinch your dick.

08:34.428 --> 08:36.761
- That's two. You want to go for three?
- Okay.

08:36.764 --> 08:38.429
Bingo! You got it!
You want another one?

08:38.432 --> 08:40.099
- Pretty, pretty please.
- You got it!

08:40.101 --> 08:41.400
- You want another one?
- I'll take them all!

08:41.402 --> 08:42.736
That's seven!
You want another one?!

08:42.738 --> 08:43.803
Give me ten!

08:43.804 --> 08:45.170
Bingo!

08:45.172 --> 08:47.240
Mac! Stop.

08:47.242 --> 08:51.011
You mess with the bull,
you get covered in bullshit.

08:56.450 --> 08:58.450
- What a tool.
- Yeah.

08:58.452 --> 08:59.953
I had the craziest dream.

08:59.955 --> 09:01.521
Who were the cops this time?

09:01.523 --> 09:02.889
Stifler and Damon Wayans Jr.

09:02.891 --> 09:04.024
Did they almost kiss?

09:04.026 --> 09:06.926
Yeah. Yeah.
Almost got them to.

09:08.830 --> 09:09.962
Uh, hello.

09:09.964 --> 09:12.665
- Morning, Mac!
- Good morning, Uncle Argyle.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.635
Code names? Is Farva nearby?

09:15.637 --> 09:16.870
Oh, yeah. Spitting distance.

09:16.872 --> 09:19.137
Do me a favor,
spackle his mouth shut.

09:19.139 --> 09:20.473
<i>Okay, will do.</i>

09:20.475 --> 09:23.609
So, change of location for
this weekend's fishing trip.

09:23.611 --> 09:25.245
Just over the Canadian border.

09:25.247 --> 09:27.112
Oh, sweet! I love Canada.

09:27.114 --> 09:30.150
Good one!
I'll mail you the address.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.852
- What, like with a stamp? Just text me.
- <i>Text?</i>

09:32.854 --> 09:36.290
Oh, you mean like,
uh, mail text? Yeah.

09:36.292 --> 09:38.891
I do believe I have
that facility on this phone.

09:38.893 --> 09:40.293
Okay, will do.

09:40.295 --> 09:42.261
That's it. I'm teaching you
how to text this weekend.

09:42.263 --> 09:43.963
- No personal calls, Mac.
- What the fuck?

09:43.965 --> 09:46.698
- Whoop.
- Oh, God damn it, Farva.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.368
- I told you no personal calls.
- It was a sales call.

09:49.370 --> 09:50.670
Oh, yeah?
What were they selling?

09:50.672 --> 09:52.572
Ooh, was it canned salmon?
I love canned salmon.

09:52.574 --> 09:54.741
It's better than tuna,
you know. It's a salty fish.

09:54.743 --> 09:55.842
I like a salty fish.

09:55.844 --> 09:57.477
Like a grouper
or maybe a branzino.

09:57.479 --> 09:59.545
Something that really
jerks off your blood pressure.

09:59.547 --> 10:02.082
You know what's salty? Turtle.
You ever had turtle before?

10:02.084 --> 10:03.750
Saltiest part? The shell.

10:03.752 --> 10:05.885
What do I have to say to get
you to end this conversation?

10:05.887 --> 10:07.286
You could say,
"The guy on the phone

10:07.288 --> 10:09.054
was trying to sell me
hard dicks."

10:09.056 --> 10:10.957
The guy on the phone was
trying to sell me hard dicks.

10:10.959 --> 10:12.858
I bet you bought
a baker's dozen.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.059
Let's lay some caulk!

10:14.061 --> 10:16.565
I got fresh caulk, everybody!
Hot caulk here.

10:17.499 --> 10:19.631
Who wants caulk?

10:19.633 --> 10:22.168
He really wants to leave
right from work, huh?

10:22.170 --> 10:24.173
He said,
"Real men travel light."

10:36.084 --> 10:38.220
God, he looks ridiculous.

10:41.455 --> 10:43.256
No, I think
he looks pretty cool.

10:43.258 --> 10:44.491
Like the Brawny
Paper Towel Guy.

10:44.493 --> 10:47.160
See, I was gonna say
the Bombay Paper Towel Guy.

10:47.162 --> 10:48.261
- Hey, Thorn.
- Hey.

10:48.263 --> 10:50.863
Job sucks.
It's all sap and splinters.

10:51.966 --> 10:53.599
Now it smells like Bombay.

10:53.601 --> 10:54.934
- You wanna put that shirt back on?
- Whew!

10:54.936 --> 10:56.069
Breathe it in, little fella.

10:56.071 --> 10:57.569
That's the smell
of a mountain man.

10:57.571 --> 11:00.106
Right. Okay, what time you due
back at the hobo zoo?

11:05.912 --> 11:07.179
Hey, hey!

11:07.181 --> 11:08.481
What's up, guys?

11:08.483 --> 11:09.849
Nice ride!

11:09.851 --> 11:11.083
Hey, Chief.

11:11.085 --> 11:12.388
Son of a bitch.

11:13.153 --> 11:14.920
- Ta-da!
- Hey!

11:14.922 --> 11:16.423
What's up, Foster?

11:16.425 --> 11:17.491
He is all yours.

11:17.493 --> 11:19.959
I'm tired of him riding
in my sidecar anyway.

11:19.961 --> 11:21.493
That's not what
you said last night.

11:21.495 --> 11:23.029
<i>Chief, we have a 214</i>

11:23.031 --> 11:24.564
<i>out at
the Shuck n' Rack Motel.</i>

11:24.566 --> 11:25.665
<i>Officer needs guidance.</i>

11:25.667 --> 11:27.299
- I'll be right there.
- <i>Copy.</i>

11:27.301 --> 11:29.102
I wish you guys
didn't get fired.

11:29.104 --> 11:31.838
We weren't fired.
We were invited to resign.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.205
- Ah.
- Ooh, I like that.

11:33.207 --> 11:36.007
No, you were fired. There was
that ride-along gone wrong.

11:36.009 --> 11:38.010
Then you were fired.

11:38.012 --> 11:39.612
We'll just have to agree
to disagree.

11:39.614 --> 11:40.746
All right.

11:40.748 --> 11:42.948
Well, you fellas have fun.

11:42.950 --> 11:45.184
Just get him back
in one piece, all right?

11:45.186 --> 11:47.587
With the rod. I'm gonna
need it next weekend.

11:47.589 --> 11:48.654
Hello!

11:48.656 --> 11:49.622
That's my girl.

11:49.624 --> 11:51.325
All right, boys,
let's go fishing.

11:54.361 --> 11:56.127
And the beauty is,
the black is so black

11:56.129 --> 11:57.296
that it's really blue.

11:57.298 --> 11:59.232
I mean,
it's really midnight blue.

11:59.234 --> 12:01.032
Ah, just like
the old days, huh?

12:01.034 --> 12:02.367
Driving around
the countryside,

12:02.369 --> 12:03.937
listening to Thorny
talk about his dick.

12:03.939 --> 12:05.872
- I miss the old days.
- That's bullshit, man.

12:05.874 --> 12:07.473
That Fred Savage thing
was not our fault.

12:07.475 --> 12:09.275
Actors shouldn't
do ride-alongs.

12:09.277 --> 12:10.876
Actors shouldn't even
try to play cops.

12:10.878 --> 12:12.612
I mean,
they never get it right.

12:19.988 --> 12:22.155
- Hey, there.
- How you doin'?

12:22.157 --> 12:24.490
Good. You boys here
for business or pleasure?

12:24.492 --> 12:26.126
- Just going fishing.
- Good timing.

12:26.128 --> 12:27.727
You'll be up to yer tits
in the walleye.

12:27.729 --> 12:30.096
I caught one last week.
Was seven kilograms.

12:30.098 --> 12:31.530
Is that big?

12:31.532 --> 12:33.734
Is that big? That's like nine
decimeters from tip to tail.

12:34.735 --> 12:37.102
- You a jigger man?
- What did you call me?

12:37.104 --> 12:38.271
Well, I like to use
the jigger rod

12:38.273 --> 12:39.572
for when I'm catching
the walleye.

12:39.574 --> 12:40.873
But of course
when you're doing that

12:40.875 --> 12:42.174
you gotta run extra light.

12:42.176 --> 12:45.078
Unless you're someone like
you there in the back.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.913
- What are you, a bodybuilder?
- No.

12:46.915 --> 12:48.580
What do you bench?
Wait, don't tell me.

12:48.582 --> 12:50.315
I don't want you
to embarrass me.

12:50.317 --> 12:53.519
- But I would like two tickets to your gun show.
- Ah, okay.

12:53.521 --> 12:56.454
You guys are good to go.
Sorry to hold ya up.

12:56.456 --> 12:59.327
- Let them go!
- Thanks! Take her easy.

13:00.561 --> 13:02.694
Typical Canadian hardass.

13:02.696 --> 13:04.997
"Sorry.
I'm really sorry. Sorry."

13:04.999 --> 13:06.698
"Oh, so sorry."

13:06.700 --> 13:08.700
Hey,
fellas, any chance you can

13:08.702 --> 13:11.003
come over to the house later
and play some Sorry?

13:11.005 --> 13:13.272
Sure.
How about nine o'clock?

13:13.274 --> 13:15.141
Ooh,
nine o'clock doesn't work.

13:15.143 --> 13:16.543
Sorry about that.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.277
French ones are the worst. Ha!

13:18.279 --> 13:20.378
Would you
like some <i>ratatouille</i>

13:20.380 --> 13:22.681
with your <i>pain du chocolat?</i>

13:22.683 --> 13:26.218
<i>Oui, oui</i>! I'm gonna get
some <i>jambon et fromage.</i>

13:29.224 --> 13:30.455
This can't be it.

13:30.457 --> 13:32.324
Well, this is the address
Cap sent me.

13:32.326 --> 13:35.059
Although he did just learn
how to text.

13:35.061 --> 13:36.295
Now what would compel somebody

13:36.297 --> 13:37.664
to throw a tire
up on the roof?

13:37.666 --> 13:40.165
What, you never played
"Throw the Tire on the Roof"?

13:40.167 --> 13:41.333
No, is that the kind of shit

13:41.335 --> 13:42.501
you guys played in Rutland?

13:42.503 --> 13:44.873
Sure. Never got
"tired" of that game.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.747
Uh, we are
in the wrong place.

13:55.749 --> 13:59.117
No. You're in the right place.

13:59.119 --> 14:00.252
What's the deal
with the creepy,

14:00.254 --> 14:01.420
remote shithole, Cap?

14:01.422 --> 14:02.988
You gonna make us put
the lotion in the basket?

14:02.990 --> 14:04.591
No, I've got a surprise
for you.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.025
I didn't tell you up front
'cause you tend to be

14:07.027 --> 14:09.429
a bunch of
wide-mouth bassholes.

14:09.431 --> 14:13.998
Well, then, why don't you let
me reel in these fish, John?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.568
Governor Jessman?

14:15.570 --> 14:17.069
Hey, I didn't see
the motorcade.

14:17.071 --> 14:19.606
- We're keeping my visit quiet.
- Mm.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.973
Oh, Cappy, you dirty dog.

14:20.975 --> 14:22.641
Show some respect, Mac!

14:22.643 --> 14:23.609
Sorry.

14:23.611 --> 14:25.511
I'm here
on official business.

14:25.513 --> 14:27.814
We've got
an intriguing situation

14:27.816 --> 14:29.549
going on in these parts.

14:29.551 --> 14:32.319
With all the heat
on immigration these days,

14:32.321 --> 14:33.986
the U.S. has been
going through

14:33.988 --> 14:35.420
a border reassessment.

14:35.422 --> 14:38.223
It turns out that some
of the original stone markers

14:38.225 --> 14:40.392
that delineated
America from Canada,

14:40.394 --> 14:41.763
weren't where
we thought they'd be.

14:42.562 --> 14:44.664
Here is where the border was.

14:44.666 --> 14:48.734
But here is where
we found the stone markers.

14:48.736 --> 14:51.471
So this town,
St. Georges du Laurent,

14:51.473 --> 14:53.372
and the area surrounding it,

14:53.374 --> 14:55.440
are actually on American soil.

14:55.442 --> 14:56.876
So we're going to war?

14:56.878 --> 14:59.145
Ah, gee,
that'd be a quick one, eh?

15:00.380 --> 15:01.848
No. After negotiations,

15:01.850 --> 15:03.782
they've agreed
to turn the land over.

15:03.784 --> 15:04.751
Vermont's about to get

15:04.753 --> 15:06.586
- a little more head room.
- Hm.

15:06.588 --> 15:08.255
So, it was up to me to find

15:08.257 --> 15:10.723
a temporary police force
to help with the transition.

15:10.725 --> 15:13.959
A group of officers
familiar with the border area,

15:13.961 --> 15:17.796
experienced in patrolling
a stretch of highway.

15:17.798 --> 15:21.833
Guys who maybe caught a bad
break the last time around?

15:21.835 --> 15:24.136
So, you fellas want
a crack at your old jobs?

15:26.407 --> 15:29.875
Easy, you hooligans!
I'm a senior citizen!

15:29.877 --> 15:32.411
And if this two-week
assignment goes well,

15:32.413 --> 15:34.247
I might be able
to make it permanent.

15:34.249 --> 15:36.650
Trust us. It'll go well.

15:36.652 --> 15:37.982
And who are you?

15:37.984 --> 15:39.819
Oh, I'm one of the cops.

15:39.821 --> 15:41.621
We picked him up
outside of Home Depot.

15:41.623 --> 15:43.455
Fantastic.

15:43.457 --> 15:45.525
You'll be phasing out
a Canadian Mountie unit.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.727
We lined up a meet and greet
with them tomorrow.

15:50.130 --> 15:51.430
Oh, yeah!

15:51.432 --> 15:53.632
I wanted to make sure you had
your full team back,

15:53.634 --> 15:55.568
so I tracked down
your other guy too.

15:55.570 --> 15:56.935
No fucking way.

15:56.937 --> 15:57.837
Oh, no.

15:57.839 --> 16:01.306
Sorry I'm late.
Hit a moose doing 90.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.309
Vaporized the beyotch!

16:03.311 --> 16:04.776
You know they have
Eskimo hookers up here?

16:04.778 --> 16:06.880
When they have sex,
they really get "Inuit".

16:06.882 --> 16:08.613
Pelé!

16:09.484 --> 16:10.686
God damn it.

16:11.452 --> 16:12.785
Farva, you fuck.

16:12.787 --> 16:13.953
Back in business!

16:37.043 --> 16:41.146
Bullshit! Who ordered these?
I can't feel my tits!

17:05.772 --> 17:06.838
Hey!

17:06.839 --> 17:08.272
Desk buddies, guy?

17:08.275 --> 17:10.510
Are you positive
you want to quit your old job?

17:10.512 --> 17:12.478
I mean,
Construction Supervisor.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.279
And give up the chance
to crack some Canuck melons?

17:14.281 --> 17:16.084
I don't think so, bro-haim.

17:17.151 --> 17:18.751
<i>♪ Welcome to the Fart Zone ♪</i>

17:18.752 --> 17:20.617
Body armor, check.

17:20.619 --> 17:23.255
Tactical flashlights. Why not?

17:23.257 --> 17:25.390
Ooh, heat vision goggles.
Check.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.693
Why would we need those?

17:26.694 --> 17:27.893
Uh, we're in Canada now,
Rabbit.

17:27.895 --> 17:29.627
What if we have to find
somebody in the snow?

17:29.629 --> 17:30.695
Uh, there is snow in Vermont.

17:30.697 --> 17:32.431
Okay,
I'm the "order stuff" guy.

17:32.433 --> 17:33.801
You do your thing. All right?

17:34.202 --> 17:35.334
Okay.

17:35.336 --> 17:38.738
One yellow safety vest
for Rabbit.

17:38.740 --> 17:41.941
Woo! A roving
GPS triangulator.

17:41.943 --> 17:44.409
Triangulator? Get a load
of James Bond over here.

17:45.679 --> 17:48.114
Another yellow safety vest
for Thorny.

17:48.116 --> 17:49.648
Thorn, Thorn, Thorn,
Thorn, Thorn, Thorn.

17:49.650 --> 17:53.319
Ram. Rod. Ram. Rod. Ramrod.
You're out, he's in.

17:53.321 --> 17:55.320
Okay.

17:55.322 --> 17:57.656
Hey, place looks great!

17:57.658 --> 17:59.024
What have you
been cleaning, Cap?

17:59.026 --> 18:01.327
I'll clean your clock
if you don't watch out.

18:01.329 --> 18:02.830
Okay, let's get started.

18:03.998 --> 18:05.396
Don't push it, Mac.

18:05.398 --> 18:06.866
Get started
doing some pullovers?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.200
No, we're not doing
your pullovers.

18:08.202 --> 18:09.503
Everything will be
by the book.

18:10.303 --> 18:11.605
Everything!

18:14.542 --> 18:16.674
Cap, you know how hard
I worked on this thing?

18:16.676 --> 18:18.476
Big face, big mustache.

18:18.478 --> 18:20.279
I don't care how big
your face is. Shave it!

18:20.281 --> 18:21.347
Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap!

18:21.349 --> 18:22.414
I'm good, right?

18:22.416 --> 18:24.482
I got a tight mouth-muff.

18:24.484 --> 18:27.219
- Talk about big faces.
- That's face-ism, Cap.

18:27.221 --> 18:29.088
Not regulation! Shave it!

18:29.090 --> 18:31.991
Right! Let's go
and see some Mounties.

18:31.993 --> 18:35.931
Remember the three
B's: Best Behavior, Boys.

18:39.767 --> 18:40.801
Hey.

18:42.102 --> 18:45.003
- How's it going?
- Feels like 1983 in here.

18:45.005 --> 18:46.538
Oh, there they are.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.540
I am Mayor Guy LeFranc.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.344
Mayor of Saint Georges
du Laurent, Canada!

18:51.346 --> 18:53.613
Or, as it's about to be known:

18:53.615 --> 18:56.348
St. George of Lawrence,
America.

18:56.350 --> 18:59.385
I don't know. I'm not so good
with American. Welcome.

18:59.387 --> 19:01.119
Uh, the Guy LeFranc?

19:01.121 --> 19:03.388
From the Montreal Canadiens
Minor League system?

19:03.390 --> 19:05.825
The leading scorer
of the Halifax Bear Eaters?

19:05.827 --> 19:07.693
Eighth most points
in CHL history.

19:07.695 --> 19:10.061
Yeah, I know. Two points
behind Shotti Fitznugly.

19:10.063 --> 19:11.129
Look at this guy!

19:11.131 --> 19:12.365
I love hockey.

19:12.367 --> 19:13.732
Your nickname, um,

19:13.734 --> 19:15.467
don't tell me,
it was, uh, "The Explosion".

19:15.469 --> 19:17.337
"The Halifax Explosion."

19:17.339 --> 19:19.370
Named after
the single greatest

19:19.372 --> 19:21.840
man-made explosion
before Hiroshima.

19:21.842 --> 19:23.541
It was 1917,

19:23.543 --> 19:24.976
ship laden with dynamite

19:24.978 --> 19:27.379
crashed into another ship
in Halifax Harbor.

19:27.381 --> 19:28.947
Tremendous explosion
and loss of life.

19:28.949 --> 19:30.683
Burned people's eyes out
with the blast.

19:30.685 --> 19:32.351
Many were blinded
by the light.

19:32.353 --> 19:33.484
Like the song says.

19:33.486 --> 19:36.088
And a First Nations tribe
was lost.

19:36.090 --> 19:37.589
Probably would've
happened to them anyway,

19:37.591 --> 19:39.157
but it kind of moved up the timetable, eh?

19:39.159 --> 19:43.128
So, I am the second biggest
explosion from Halifax.

19:43.130 --> 19:44.262
But enough about me.

19:44.264 --> 19:45.697
Meet the Mounties. Guys!

19:45.699 --> 19:47.899
Guys, come on over here.

19:47.901 --> 19:51.069
This here is Sergeant Major
Roger Archambault.

19:51.071 --> 19:54.773
This is Staff Sergeant Major
Henri Podein,

19:54.775 --> 19:57.342
and Sergeant
Christophe Bellefuille.

19:57.344 --> 19:58.644
Total gobbledygook.

19:58.646 --> 20:01.547
I'm John O'Hagan.
This is Rod Farva,

20:01.549 --> 20:04.517
Robbie Roto, Carl Foster,
MacIntyre Womack

20:04.519 --> 20:06.319
and Arcot Ramathorn.

20:09.756 --> 20:11.155
I'll let
you guys chew the cud.

20:11.157 --> 20:12.657
Why don't we go fuck off
to the other room here?

20:12.659 --> 20:14.961
Yeah, sure.

20:16.030 --> 20:19.334
I'm gonna get a Schlitz!
That's American for beer.

20:22.570 --> 20:24.669
So, you do guys
ride horses or...

20:24.671 --> 20:26.238
Yeah, this isn't 1957.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.773
We drive Crown Victorias.

20:27.775 --> 20:29.607
Hey, us too.
You get a little soup in them,

20:29.609 --> 20:31.976
they can really rip
your knob off. Am I right?

20:32.980 --> 20:35.080
We hear about you guy, heh?

20:35.082 --> 20:38.383
Because first, you get your
highway station shut down.

20:38.385 --> 20:40.051
And then, you get kick out

20:40.053 --> 20:42.823
from your second job
because of this, uh,

20:43.558 --> 20:45.357
Fred Savage thing.

20:45.359 --> 20:46.626
"Savage."

20:46.628 --> 20:48.260
Makes it
sound intriguing, at least.

20:48.262 --> 20:50.229
So, what are you going to do here?

20:50.231 --> 20:51.563
Go for the hat trick?

20:52.899 --> 20:54.665
Well, we're actually hoping
to hold on to these jobs.

20:55.770 --> 20:57.669
What are you guys
doing after the turnover?

20:57.671 --> 21:00.540
Oh, they're transferring us
up to Labrador City.

21:00.542 --> 21:01.607
- Oh!
- Cool.

21:01.609 --> 21:02.942
It's cool, all right.

21:02.944 --> 21:06.444
Average winter temperature
is minus 18 degrees Celsius!

21:06.446 --> 21:08.079
Yeah, all you have
to do to convert

21:08.081 --> 21:11.517
is times two, add 32 and join
the rest of the human race.

21:11.519 --> 21:12.617
Hey, Rookie,

21:12.619 --> 21:13.985
they got non-alcoholic Molsons
over here.

21:13.987 --> 21:16.320
Want me to get you
a half carafe?

21:16.322 --> 21:19.591
Oh, we got a rookie there?
They shave your nuts yet?

21:19.593 --> 21:21.327
Canadian tradition says
you got to shave

21:21.329 --> 21:23.494
the rook's nuts,
otherwise it's bad luck.

21:23.496 --> 21:25.030
- You don't say?
- Bad luck?

21:25.032 --> 21:26.665
I'm actually not a rookie...

21:26.667 --> 21:28.134
Which one of you guys
has least seniority?

21:28.136 --> 21:30.534
I mean, technically I...

21:30.536 --> 21:31.771
Shave this guy ball!

21:31.773 --> 21:33.605
Come on,
shave both of his ball.

21:34.775 --> 21:37.210
Shave your ball, your dick.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.810
Hello,
hello! Welcome to Canada.

21:39.812 --> 21:41.614
I'm Genevieve Aubois,

21:41.616 --> 21:44.116
Cultural Attaché
of Saint Georges du Laurent.

21:44.118 --> 21:46.586
I will see that
things go smoothly

21:46.588 --> 21:47.986
in the next few weeks.

21:47.988 --> 21:50.321
And please,
if you have any questions,

21:50.323 --> 21:51.993
don't hesitate to ask.

21:55.928 --> 21:57.996
Keep heading north,
big fella.

21:57.998 --> 22:00.599
You don't look at the mantel when you're
poking the fire, you know what I'm saying?

22:00.601 --> 22:02.434
- Right, guys? You know what I'm saying, right?
- Jesus, Farva.

22:03.471 --> 22:04.703
Okay.

22:04.705 --> 22:07.373
Well, they are waiting for us
in the other room.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.742
So, please, <i>suivez-moi.</i>

22:09.744 --> 22:11.413
Who is waiting where?

22:22.990 --> 22:25.760
Boy, I didn't know the whole
town was gonna be here.

22:39.873 --> 22:41.107
Oh.

22:42.076 --> 22:43.542
It's about my
mustache, right?

22:43.544 --> 22:44.844
They're laughing
at my mustache?

22:44.846 --> 22:47.745
Please, let's give a big
Canadian welcome

22:47.747 --> 22:50.549
to the Vermont Highway Patrol.

22:52.852 --> 22:54.185
Hey, hey, everyone!

22:54.187 --> 22:55.454
Come on, guys.
They've come up here

22:55.456 --> 22:56.521
to tell us how great
it's gonna be

22:56.523 --> 22:57.822
for all of us
to become Americans.

22:57.824 --> 22:59.960
So, let them speak. Captain?

23:00.695 --> 23:02.694
Uh...

23:02.696 --> 23:05.164
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

23:05.166 --> 23:08.901
You know, this reminds me
of the story of the rabbi,

23:08.903 --> 23:12.003
the priest,
and the Hindu in a canoe.

23:12.005 --> 23:13.571
Go blow yourself!

23:14.841 --> 23:16.674
I'm Captain John O'Hagan. I...

23:16.676 --> 23:19.044
Yeah, eat it, you old donkey!

23:20.013 --> 23:22.414
Hey, easy.
Hey, look, look.

23:22.416 --> 23:24.649
Technically,
we're all Americans, right?

23:24.651 --> 23:26.217
North Americans.

23:26.219 --> 23:28.754
Very little is gonna change
around here.

23:28.756 --> 23:29.988
Oh, yeah, right!
You're probably gonna tell us

23:29.990 --> 23:31.423
we can't listen
to Rush anymore!

23:31.425 --> 23:32.857
Or the Barenaked Ladies!

23:32.859 --> 23:35.360
Hey. Hey. Hey!

23:35.362 --> 23:36.662
People, people.

23:36.664 --> 23:38.597
I love Rush
and the Barenaked Ladies.

23:38.599 --> 23:39.798
You should listen to both.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.767
So, you are telling us
who to listen to!

23:41.769 --> 23:42.901
No, no. I'm just...

23:42.903 --> 23:43.969
And then that one's
gonna tell us

23:43.971 --> 23:45.404
we have to start
eating tortillas!

23:45.406 --> 23:47.775
- It's a common mistake.
- Bullshit!

23:48.376 --> 23:49.642
Hey! Listen up.

23:49.644 --> 23:51.743
This is America now.
Like it or lump it!

23:51.745 --> 23:53.212
Repeat after me:

23:53.214 --> 23:56.581
I pledge of allegiance
to the flag

23:56.583 --> 23:59.119
of the United States
of America.

23:59.654 --> 24:00.919
Learn the words!

24:00.921 --> 24:02.453
Learn the words!

24:02.455 --> 24:03.457
Fuck you!

24:11.064 --> 24:12.830
You don't even know
how to play hockey!

24:15.369 --> 24:17.802
I didn't think they'd see us
as an occupying force.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.370
Oh, my God!
Your eye.

24:19.372 --> 24:20.739
That might leave a scar.

24:20.741 --> 24:21.874
I was looking
too pretty anyway.

24:23.042 --> 24:24.809
I can sew you up at my car.

24:24.811 --> 24:25.976
You're a doctor?

24:25.978 --> 24:28.078
No, no. I coach
the girls' hockey team,

24:28.080 --> 24:30.251
so I know my way
around a gash.

24:30.885 --> 24:32.017
Are you making a...

24:32.019 --> 24:35.721
<i>Oui</i> . A double entendre
for <i>la vagine.</i>

24:37.324 --> 24:39.424
Let's go, quickly!

24:39.426 --> 24:41.760
I thought Canadians
are supposed to be harmless.

24:41.762 --> 24:43.529
Oh, come on.
Cut them some slack.

24:43.531 --> 24:45.396
They're upset
about losing their identities.

24:45.398 --> 24:48.399
They called you an old donkey.
Doesn't that piss you off?

24:48.401 --> 24:49.768
Well, I don't love it.

24:49.770 --> 24:52.136
Actually, I didn't sleep
at all last night.

24:52.138 --> 24:53.438
But we got a job to do.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.840
- Rabbit, how's your head?
- It's okay.

24:55.842 --> 25:00.213
That, uh... Genevieve,
she, uh, patched me up.

25:02.315 --> 25:03.281
Oh, please!

25:03.283 --> 25:05.917
Frenchy had her eyes
on my thighs all night long.

25:05.919 --> 25:07.051
- Yeah.
- Did she, now?

25:07.053 --> 25:08.287
Oh, yeah?
Keep laughing.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.588
I bet you a buck I bang
the crêpe out of her first.

25:10.590 --> 25:11.757
Okay.

25:11.759 --> 25:12.992
Put your money
where your mouth's been.

25:12.994 --> 25:15.728
Fuck the buck.
Loser sits on a cactus.

25:15.730 --> 25:17.928
No, loser gets a perm.

25:17.930 --> 25:20.866
No, loser cuts his
pinky-toe off with a shovel.

25:20.868 --> 25:22.467
Take that bet.

25:22.469 --> 25:24.470
- I suggest you take the bet, Rabbit. Really, honestly.
- Jump on it.

25:24.472 --> 25:25.671
Please shut up, Farva.

25:25.673 --> 25:27.138
Okay. We have a deal.

25:27.140 --> 25:28.607
You heard it, right?
We have a deal.

25:28.609 --> 25:31.277
Oh, so, this is where they
keep the illegal aliens, huh?

25:31.279 --> 25:33.278
Ah, welcome, Officers!

25:33.280 --> 25:34.914
Welcome to the guys
who stood around

25:34.916 --> 25:36.580
while people threw
hockey pucks at us?

25:36.582 --> 25:37.715
You gonna
come up here talking

25:37.717 --> 25:39.284
all that
"Make America Great" crap,

25:39.286 --> 25:42.120
you're bound to catch a face
full of Canadian tomato.

25:42.122 --> 25:43.489
Okay, okay.
Listen up.

25:43.491 --> 25:45.457
Two of you are gonna ride
with the Mounties.

25:45.459 --> 25:47.291
They'll show you where
the bodies are buried.

25:47.293 --> 25:49.294
- Not it.
- Actually, it is you two.

25:50.363 --> 25:52.364
It's not our idea
of a good time either, fellas.

25:52.366 --> 25:54.903
Personally, I'd rather
fuck a moose.

25:55.802 --> 25:57.502
You would need a ladder
to do that.

25:57.504 --> 26:00.905
Obviously, I would need
a ladder to fuck a moose.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.876
But I would find one,
and I would fuck that moose.

26:03.878 --> 26:05.043
Okay!

26:05.045 --> 26:07.546
Thorny, Rabbit,
I got a highway job for you.

26:07.548 --> 26:08.549
Let's do it!

26:12.919 --> 26:14.618
Hey, Cap? Cap?

26:14.620 --> 26:15.921
Whose car do I ride in?

26:15.923 --> 26:17.990
Why don't you
stay here with me?

26:17.992 --> 26:19.590
Sit over here.

26:19.592 --> 26:20.961
That's the radio, though.

26:21.361 --> 26:22.328
Great idea!

26:22.330 --> 26:25.763
That way, if a call comes in,
you can answer it.

26:25.765 --> 26:27.031
Huh?

26:28.436 --> 26:31.002
Okay, just today, though,
okay?

26:31.004 --> 26:33.308
Everyone takes a turn.
It's a new station.

26:35.609 --> 26:36.677
Fuckin' radio.

26:39.146 --> 26:40.548
What the fuck is this shit?

26:42.082 --> 26:43.682
I mean, it's not gonna
kill him, is it?

26:43.684 --> 26:46.020
I don't know. Do you
want it to kill him?

26:47.655 --> 26:48.753
<i>Allons-y!</i>

26:50.358 --> 26:51.624
Just a minute!

26:51.626 --> 26:52.992
Just a, uh...

26:52.994 --> 26:54.926
What's Canadian
for "minute"?

26:59.734 --> 27:00.933
Ah.

27:00.935 --> 27:02.470
There they are. Okay.

27:04.171 --> 27:05.205
Hm.

27:11.111 --> 27:13.811
Are you swallowing
M&M's whole?

27:13.813 --> 27:16.450
Yeah. The green ones
make me horny.

27:18.685 --> 27:20.251
Why don't you chew them first?

27:20.253 --> 27:23.023
They all go
to the same place, right?

27:28.294 --> 27:29.961
<i>Hey, Farva,
can I get a radio check?</i>

27:36.771 --> 27:38.404
Why did you shock
your buddy, buddy?

27:39.740 --> 27:43.841
You know, every job has that
one guy that you love to hate.

27:43.843 --> 27:45.543
Yeah, obnoxious. Oafish.

27:45.545 --> 27:48.047
Oh, yeah, you mean like
your typical American?

27:52.218 --> 27:53.653
Still waiting
on that radio check.

28:01.161 --> 28:02.629
Fuckin' shit!

28:03.362 --> 28:04.930
This is an awesome assignment.

28:04.932 --> 28:07.532
Oh, come on, it's great.
Outside. On duty.

28:07.534 --> 28:11.302
Hey, what's 80 kilometers
per hour in English?

28:11.304 --> 28:15.007
I guess
49.7097 miles per hour.

28:15.009 --> 28:16.974
Uh, I don't think
we have any decimals.

28:16.976 --> 28:19.145
- Do you have a Sharpie?
- Uh, no.

28:19.147 --> 28:21.914
<i>Unit 23. Come in, 23.
Unit 23. Come in, 23.</i>

28:21.916 --> 28:24.915
Radio, until the turnover,
we have to keep things metric.

28:24.917 --> 28:29.553
So we are now Unit 37.015.
Try again.

28:29.555 --> 28:30.489
Whatever.

28:30.491 --> 28:33.992
I got a call out
on Rue de Autoroute 77

28:33.994 --> 28:35.726
or some
<i>Frère Jacques</i> bullshit.

28:35.728 --> 28:38.129
There's a gaggle of dead
Canadian Geese on the road.

28:38.131 --> 28:40.232
Yeah, up here, they just
call them geese, Radio.

28:40.234 --> 28:42.334
<i>Yeah, well, in two weeks,
I call them American Geese.</i>

28:42.336 --> 28:44.135
Honk, honk. Go clean them off.

28:44.137 --> 28:47.841
That's a big 16.09-6436,
good buddy.

28:50.278 --> 28:52.309
Ah, ya,
there's the Pancake Shed.

28:52.311 --> 28:54.279
And that's the Flapjack's.

28:54.281 --> 28:55.446
Oh, there on the right,

28:55.448 --> 28:57.549
that's Gigi's Bait,
Tackle and Pancakes.

28:57.551 --> 29:00.152
- But they're really known more for their waffles.
- Yeah, they are.

29:00.154 --> 29:02.453
Sounds like the Queen
must really love pancakes.

29:02.455 --> 29:03.989
What's that supposed to mean?

29:03.991 --> 29:06.325
Aren't you guys still
ruled by the Queen of England?

29:06.327 --> 29:07.392
I mean, she's
all over your money.

29:07.394 --> 29:08.460
I'll have you know that

29:08.462 --> 29:11.262
we achieved
our independence in 1982.

29:11.264 --> 29:12.530
- Ooh!
- Oh!

29:12.532 --> 29:14.165
1982.

29:14.167 --> 29:16.635
Did Wham! perform at the ceremony?

29:16.637 --> 29:18.570
Maybe if we had
our independence sooner,

29:18.572 --> 29:20.538
we'd have no gun control,
not believe in evolution

29:20.540 --> 29:23.644
and all be morbidly obese
without healthcare.

29:25.312 --> 29:27.412
Why don't you
pull in right up here?

29:27.414 --> 29:29.817
Time for you to meet
the local business owners.

29:48.569 --> 29:49.867
Escorts?

29:49.869 --> 29:51.203
Here we are, boys.

29:57.577 --> 29:59.444
Are we here
to bust up a cat-house?

29:59.446 --> 30:01.780
You can't arrest
people for having boners.

30:01.782 --> 30:03.214
It's legal up here, Yank.

30:03.216 --> 30:05.416
A hockey-themed,
dual-sex bordello.

30:05.418 --> 30:07.051
Do we have that in the U.S.?

30:07.053 --> 30:08.653
I don't know,
but put me in, Coach.

30:08.655 --> 30:10.488
Oh, oh! Look who it is!
It's the fuzz.

30:10.490 --> 30:12.223
The Mayor hangs out
in a bordello?

30:12.225 --> 30:14.858
No, the Mayor
own the bordello.

30:14.860 --> 30:15.793
Here you go, boys.

30:15.795 --> 30:17.861
How about a beer and a tug?
On the house.

30:17.863 --> 30:19.598
- Hey!
- Oh, uh...

30:19.600 --> 30:20.566
Uh, maybe later.

30:20.568 --> 30:23.335
Oh, I understand.
Scram, girls.

30:23.337 --> 30:25.936
- How's it going, eh?
- Yeah, no, no. Maybe later.

30:25.938 --> 30:27.138
You guys!

30:27.140 --> 30:28.540
You don't like women,
you don't like men.

30:28.542 --> 30:30.509
I mean, what should I get, a
river beaver to pleasure you?

30:30.511 --> 30:33.311
It's a joke. Their teeth are so
sharp, it would be horrible.

30:33.313 --> 30:34.547
How can I help you fellas?

30:34.549 --> 30:36.615
Oh, the Yanks want to talk
about their U.S. laws.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.849
You know,
like serving weaker beer

30:38.851 --> 30:40.786
and shutting down brothels.

30:40.788 --> 30:42.220
Shutting down
brothels?

30:42.222 --> 30:43.355
Who put you up to this?

30:43.357 --> 30:45.522
Was it Jean-Paul
down at Chez Poontang?

30:45.524 --> 30:47.059
Huh?
You guys pulling my chain?

30:47.061 --> 30:48.126
Look, I don't think
this is anything

30:48.128 --> 30:49.560
we need to get
too hung up on right now.

30:49.562 --> 30:50.928
I can't believe
down in the States,

30:50.930 --> 30:52.830
it's illegal to have a beer
and enjoy tits and a dick.

30:52.832 --> 30:55.200
I mean, beep beep!

30:55.202 --> 30:56.902
- There's no harm there.
- Oh. Uh...

30:58.906 --> 31:00.672
- Good workout, eh?
- Wow.

31:00.674 --> 31:03.474
Honestly, Guy, we're not
here to lay down any laws.

31:03.476 --> 31:05.643
We're very sorry if there's
been a misunderstanding.

31:05.645 --> 31:08.512
"We're sahrry?" "Sahrry."

31:10.183 --> 31:12.253
I'm sorry,
but that sounds stupid.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.386
- So sahrry.
- Sahrry.

31:15.388 --> 31:17.289
It's funny. I know.

31:17.291 --> 31:20.158
And what exactly
is your beef with our beer?

31:20.160 --> 31:21.658
Oh, I don't have
any problem with the beer.

31:21.660 --> 31:23.561
I mean, I think the limit in the U.S.
is what, nine percent?

31:23.563 --> 31:26.063
Nine percent? How are you
supposed to get drunk?

31:26.065 --> 31:27.432
I mean, you know,

31:27.434 --> 31:29.033
I think the idea is you drink
more of the weaker stuff.

31:29.035 --> 31:30.202
I bet it is.

31:30.204 --> 31:31.703
You Americans drinking
and eating everything.

31:31.705 --> 31:34.205
- Oh, no, you shouldn't.
- So fat.

31:34.207 --> 31:35.773
How about a little help
over here, huh?

31:35.775 --> 31:38.010
Yeah, I don't think we have
jurisdiction here anymore, buddy.

31:38.012 --> 31:39.478
Okay, all right.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.279
It's not like we're here to
"screw you" out of your rights.

31:41.281 --> 31:42.848
Darn tootin' you're not.

31:42.850 --> 31:43.949
Okay, look, relax.

31:43.951 --> 31:45.216
Go away, you American pigs!

31:47.455 --> 31:48.953
- Go home!
- Oh!

31:48.955 --> 31:50.155
Take it easy.

31:50.157 --> 31:51.826
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

31:53.327 --> 31:54.926

34:50.436 --> 34:51.936
You ever hear
of the Cuban Embargo?

34:51.938 --> 34:53.605
That embargo
is yesterday's news.

34:53.607 --> 34:54.873
Not for me it isn't.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.545
That's like sucking
Castro's cold wrinkled dick.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.712
Cuban cigars,

35:00.714 --> 35:02.713
counterfeit iPhones
and unmarked pills.

35:02.715 --> 35:03.949
We got something here.

35:03.951 --> 35:06.884
You boys stumbled
on quite a booty closet.

35:06.886 --> 35:08.018
A what now?

35:08.020 --> 35:09.788
Booty. Contraband.

35:09.790 --> 35:11.723
What? They don't say
"booty" anymore?

35:11.725 --> 35:13.726
- Not really, no.
- Nah.

35:14.527 --> 35:15.659
Canadian counterfeit iPhones?

35:15.661 --> 35:17.994
We should call them
"A"-Phones, eh? Right?

35:24.571 --> 35:27.005
They all have the same number?
That's a rip-off.

35:27.007 --> 35:29.273
So, what pills do we have?

35:29.275 --> 35:30.541
Not sure.

35:30.543 --> 35:32.978
Five different kinds.
None of them have markings.

35:32.980 --> 35:34.145
Send them to the lab.

35:34.147 --> 35:36.280
I tried! The U.S. lab said
send them to the Canadian lab.

35:36.282 --> 35:37.382
The Canadian lab said,

35:37.384 --> 35:38.516
"Oh, ya, hey there.

35:38.518 --> 35:39.550
"Send 'em over
to the U.S. lab there."

35:39.552 --> 35:40.918
Maybe the Mounties
have some pull?

35:40.920 --> 35:42.554
Boo!

35:42.556 --> 35:43.621
Fuck the Mounties!

35:43.623 --> 35:44.889
- Fuckin' Canada.
- Fuck that.

35:44.891 --> 35:46.690
For all we know,
this was the Mounties.

35:46.692 --> 35:48.692
Easy on the local cop
conspiracies.

35:48.694 --> 35:50.895
We'll solve
this case ourselves.

35:50.897 --> 35:52.496
I'll put a call
out to Montpelier,

35:52.498 --> 35:55.233
see if they can
line up a lab for us.

35:55.235 --> 35:57.469
Wah, wah!
I don't need some nerd

35:57.471 --> 35:59.139
in a lab coat
to tell me what this shit is.

36:02.641 --> 36:04.608
Sometimes even
I've gotta hand it to you,

36:04.610 --> 36:05.909
you weird son of a bitch.

36:05.911 --> 36:07.612
But why is it that
you chew a pill

36:07.614 --> 36:09.514
yet you swallow M&M's whole?

36:09.516 --> 36:11.884

36:11.886 --> 36:13.253

36:14.587 --> 36:16.454

36:16.456 --> 36:17.521

36:23.864 --> 36:25.931

36:25.933 --> 36:27.666

36:27.668 --> 36:29.199

like a heavy barbiturate?

36:29.201 --> 36:30.367
Maybe a muscle relaxant?

36:30.369 --> 36:31.802
You really can't move?

36:31.804 --> 36:34.771
I'm numb. I'm totally numb.

36:34.773 --> 36:36.310
Okay.

36:37.177 --> 36:38.543
What are you doing?

36:38.545 --> 36:39.643
Oh!

36:39.645 --> 36:41.779
Fuck you, Mac.
I need medical attention.

36:41.781 --> 36:44.248
Side effects may include
fatness and irritability.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.019
I think it's a mood enhancer.

36:47.487 --> 36:48.853
God damn it.

36:48.855 --> 36:51.255
I know I'm in a better mood.

36:51.257 --> 36:52.322

any more fly strips?

1,509 hairs in your mustache.

38:32.259 --> 38:35.927
Close! 1,521. I had them
counted for my birthday.

38:35.929 --> 38:37.762

- Yeah.

38:37.764 --> 38:39.398

38:47.005 --> 38:48.172
You guys come up

38:48.174 --> 38:50.775

38:59.451 --> 39:00.719
Okay.

39:00.721 --> 39:02.621
Well, the shack's a dead end.

39:02.623 --> 39:05.088
It's on abandoned land owned
by a defunct mining company.

39:05.090 --> 39:07.157
So, anyone could have
put the booty out there.

39:08.560 --> 39:09.929
Why you laughing, Guy Smiley?

39:15.935 --> 39:18.168
Okay, if we
stake out the shack

39:18.170 --> 39:20.538
maybe we can catch
someone coming or going.

39:20.540 --> 39:21.605
Let's get back out there.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.177

39:40.125 --> 39:41.592

39:41.594 --> 39:43.427
Come on! Hit the radio!

39:43.429 --> 39:44.998
Farva! Come on!

39:52.038 --> 39:54.172
Uh-oh.

39:54.174 --> 39:55.607

40:05.752 --> 40:08.322

40:11.156 --> 40:12.292
Whew!

40:16.828 --> 40:19.697
Bunnies! Bunnies!

40:19.699 --> 40:21.433
Hi, bunny. Hi.

40:21.435 --> 40:24.936
Rabbit. My name's Rabbit.
Oh, so cute little thing.

40:24.938 --> 40:26.373
Bub, bub, bub, bub.

40:38.817 --> 40:40.652
Just stay there!

40:43.056 --> 40:46.690
Feel the steroids melting away.

40:47.728 --> 40:49.793
Don't let the job
stress you out.

40:49.795 --> 40:50.994
I love the job.

40:50.996 --> 40:53.730
Doesn't stress me out.
Farva stresses me out.

40:53.732 --> 40:54.931
Such a shame.

40:54.933 --> 40:57.571
Why are the good-looking ones
always so obnoxious?

40:58.571 --> 40:59.871
You think he's good-looking?

41:01.340 --> 41:04.842
"The bigger the cushion,
the better the pushing."

41:04.844 --> 41:07.045
- No.
- No.

41:07.947 --> 41:10.215
I would rather have sex
with a baboon.

41:11.551 --> 41:12.550
It's funny though, huh?

41:12.552 --> 41:15.386
We all have that one
horrible person we work with.

41:15.388 --> 41:18.690
For me, it's my office manager
Lonnie Laloush.

41:18.692 --> 41:22.125
Oh, he can be
such a "deeckwad".

41:22.127 --> 41:24.228
What?

41:24.230 --> 41:25.295
It's just with your accent,

41:25.297 --> 41:27.264
the way you say "dickwad"
is adorable.

41:27.266 --> 41:29.599
No, but it's true.
He is a deeckwad.

41:32.471 --> 41:34.639
First you steal our job

41:34.641 --> 41:35.806
and now you sit here

41:35.808 --> 41:38.244
gazing lovingly
into the eyes of our women.

41:38.677 --> 41:40.210
Your women?

41:40.212 --> 41:42.112
Well, maybe we should
take him in the back,

41:42.114 --> 41:44.215
give him
Canadian handshake, eh?

41:44.217 --> 41:45.215
What's that?

41:45.217 --> 41:47.851
Let's just say it involve
a bag of hockey puck

41:47.853 --> 41:50.387
and a lot of warm gravy.

41:50.389 --> 41:51.556
Mm. Sounds delicious.

41:51.558 --> 41:53.090
Make way!

41:53.092 --> 41:54.994
Hot soup coming through!

41:55.828 --> 41:58.295
Oh, Canadian standoff, huh?

41:58.297 --> 42:00.096
Oh, it look like
professor Stephen Hawking

42:00.098 --> 42:01.965
has really let himself
go these days.

42:05.272 --> 42:07.237
When God created Canada,

42:07.239 --> 42:10.340
it was like
the universe farted.

42:11.243 --> 42:13.110
Why do all the fat one
always ride around

42:13.112 --> 42:14.478
on these little scooters?

42:14.480 --> 42:16.614
You ever stop and think
that if you walk,

42:16.616 --> 42:17.849
you might actually be thin?

42:20.520 --> 42:21.751
Wow.

42:21.753 --> 42:24.889
These pigs are harassing
the handicapped!

42:24.891 --> 42:27.257
Everybody look.
Take a phone video!

42:27.259 --> 42:31.996
- Hey! Leave him alone!
- Hey! This it is far from over.

42:31.998 --> 42:34.264
- You want to go to TJ's Arcade?
- <i>Oui.</i>

42:34.266 --> 42:36.266
I have some loonie
I need to break.

42:36.268 --> 42:37.569
<i>C'est bon.</i>

42:39.406 --> 42:40.907
Fuckin' Frenchies.

42:43.009 --> 42:45.342
What are you two doing together?
Mall walking?

42:45.344 --> 42:48.145
We ran into each other
at the pet store.

42:48.147 --> 42:51.181
Rabbit.
You shopping for a new gerbil?

42:53.920 --> 42:55.887
Hey, Gwenevieve
how about the two of us

42:55.889 --> 42:57.387
go over to
the Saskatchuan Palace

42:57.389 --> 42:59.657
and get a wang dang doodle?

42:59.659 --> 43:00.791
Uh, <i>non.</i>

43:00.793 --> 43:03.226
Ooh, woof woof. Put a little
bark on that and I'll bite.

43:03.228 --> 43:06.399
Okay, I'm going to go.

43:08.467 --> 43:09.800
It was great seeing you.

43:09.802 --> 43:11.571
Don't leave on my account.

43:12.505 --> 43:14.308
Uh-huh! Cocky, huh?

43:15.442 --> 43:16.607
How about we up the bet?

43:16.609 --> 43:17.907
There is no bet, Farva.

43:17.909 --> 43:19.344
Okay, new bet then.

43:19.346 --> 43:22.612
Loser not only cuts off
his pinky toe with a shovel,

43:22.614 --> 43:23.947
he puts it in a blender

43:23.949 --> 43:26.583
and drinks it in a smoothie,
toenail and all.

43:26.585 --> 43:27.817
Come on.

43:27.819 --> 43:29.119
Shake it, don't mistake it.

43:29.121 --> 43:30.587
You're serious?

43:30.589 --> 43:31.755
Serious as a heart attack.

43:31.757 --> 43:34.458
And I should know.
I've had two.

43:36.962 --> 43:38.497
- Wow.
- Pinky toe smoothie!

43:45.438 --> 43:47.607
Somebody clean this up.

43:56.482 --> 43:57.849
Son of a bitch.

43:57.851 --> 43:58.916
Hey!

43:58.918 --> 44:01.020
Heat goggles have arrived!

44:01.987 --> 44:03.422
Looking hot, Mac.

44:04.156 --> 44:06.424
Hey, nickel plated cuffs!

44:06.426 --> 44:09.793
Oh, shit.
These things are defective.

44:09.795 --> 44:10.962
What's wrong with them?

44:10.964 --> 44:12.163
They don't seem to lock.

44:12.165 --> 44:13.864
Here. Let me see.

44:13.866 --> 44:15.502
Here you go, Rabbit,
give me that hand.

44:18.837 --> 44:21.005
- I got mine to work.
- Maybe it's this one.

44:21.007 --> 44:22.806
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah, that works. Okay, good.

44:22.808 --> 44:24.074
Try the ankle ones.

44:24.076 --> 44:25.309
Oh, you always gotta
check the ankle ones.

44:25.311 --> 44:26.578
That's the most important.

44:26.580 --> 44:27.445
And here we go.

44:27.447 --> 44:29.112
You son-a-bitches.

44:29.114 --> 44:30.614
You're not shaving my balls!

44:30.616 --> 44:32.516
It would be an insult to our
Canadian hosts if we didn't.

44:32.518 --> 44:34.386
I'm not a rookie anymore.
Get these off me.

44:34.388 --> 44:35.953
Do you not want to be
an ambassador of goodwill?

44:35.955 --> 44:37.489
No. I don't. Get these off me.

44:37.491 --> 44:39.623
Rabbit, it's not like
we want to shave your balls.

44:39.625 --> 44:41.192
Thorny, do you want
to shave his balls?

44:41.194 --> 44:42.726
- Me? Hell no.
- Foster?

44:42.728 --> 44:44.628
- No way.
- You don't wanna shave his balls, do you, Farva?

44:44.630 --> 44:45.829
Hell yeah, I do!

44:45.831 --> 44:46.898
I even went out and bought

44:46.900 --> 44:48.264
one of those
old-timey straight razors.

44:48.266 --> 44:50.367
- No. No.
- Check this out.

44:52.371 --> 44:53.237
Jesus!

44:53.239 --> 44:55.072
Goddamn Canadian wiring!

44:55.074 --> 44:57.110
It's wrecking
my freakin' sperm count!

44:59.011 --> 45:01.445
Are you still taking
the Flova Scotia?

45:01.447 --> 45:03.079
What part of
"side effects include

45:03.081 --> 45:04.782
"queefing and bitchiness"
did you not understand?

45:04.784 --> 45:07.550
Dude, the orgasms are
like a moonshot.

45:07.552 --> 45:09.119
You can't keep taking
female hormones.

45:09.121 --> 45:10.487
It's gonna mess you up.

45:10.489 --> 45:11.456
Jealous much?

45:11.458 --> 45:13.090
Now who are you
orgasming with?

45:13.092 --> 45:15.259
Her name is Quebecois Debbie.

45:15.261 --> 45:18.295
Oh, Thorny, your cock,
she is so wide.

45:18.297 --> 45:20.931
I'd fuck her.

45:22.002 --> 45:24.071
- Okay, let's shave this.
- Don't.

45:36.848 --> 45:37.915
Ready?

45:37.917 --> 45:39.416
Seriously,
cut the crap, guys.

45:44.656 --> 45:46.958
Ahem!

45:46.960 --> 45:48.525
There's a bear in the station.

45:48.527 --> 45:51.262
Is that a euphemism
for something?

45:51.264 --> 45:54.232
It's a euphemism for
there's a goddamn bear

45:54.234 --> 45:57.703
eating slabs of raw meat
in the goddamn station!

46:02.308 --> 46:03.974
- Yeah. Bear.
- Okay.

46:03.976 --> 46:05.041
Where are the guns?

46:05.043 --> 46:06.744
In the room with the bear.

46:06.746 --> 46:07.978
Tear gas grenades?

46:07.980 --> 46:09.980
- I just got a new delivery!
- There you go! Where is it?

46:09.982 --> 46:12.449
In the room
with the guns and the bear.

46:12.451 --> 46:14.384
What if we send Rabbit
out to fuck the bear

46:14.386 --> 46:15.853
as a means
of distracting said bear?

46:15.855 --> 46:17.320
- Yes.
- God damn it,

46:17.322 --> 46:18.859
we've got to get
the meat out of there!

46:20.326 --> 46:21.992
Fine, fuck it. I'll do it.

46:21.994 --> 46:23.527
- I'll go with you.
- Really?

46:23.529 --> 46:24.996
Yeah. What's the worst
that could happen?

46:24.998 --> 46:26.163
You get mauled by the bear.

46:26.165 --> 46:27.598
Or that bear
could get mauled by me.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.366
- You ever think about that?
- No, I didn't.

46:29.368 --> 46:30.434
Okay, here's the plan:

46:30.436 --> 46:31.703
I'll go out there
and distract the bear,

46:31.705 --> 46:32.569
while you get the meat

46:32.571 --> 46:33.871
and get it the hell
out of the station.

46:33.873 --> 46:34.938
Team Ram-Rod!

46:34.940 --> 46:36.442
Please don't start
with that shit.

46:41.813 --> 46:43.315
Good luck, fellas.

46:45.049 --> 46:47.153
Okay.
You stay here.

46:50.822 --> 46:52.855
Big boy. Hey, big boy!

46:55.795 --> 46:57.161
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, no.

46:57.163 --> 47:00.163
Come here, Ditka.
Come here. Come here, boy!

47:00.165 --> 47:01.368
Go, go, go.

Okay.

47:07.839 --> 47:09.340
Okay, okay.

47:09.342 --> 47:10.407
Fuck you, bear.

47:10.409 --> 47:11.945
Shit.

47:15.714 --> 47:16.715

Get out of there. Stop.

47:45.377 --> 47:47.145
- Should I shoot him?
- Who? Farva?

47:47.147 --> 47:48.279
Ooh, good idea.

47:48.281 --> 47:49.882
No, no! No, no, no.

47:53.219 --> 47:54.884

47:57.456 --> 47:58.625

48:12.938 --> 48:15.038
Holy shit,
I "bear-ly" made it.

48:17.176 --> 48:18.875
That could've been "grizzly".

48:18.877 --> 48:20.444
Yeah.

48:20.446 --> 48:22.378
I think someone took
a "growler" in here.

48:22.380 --> 48:23.715
Shoot him.

48:23.717 --> 48:26.817
Fuckin' Mounties!

48:26.819 --> 48:28.085
Son of a bitch!

48:28.087 --> 48:30.688
Those guys have been assholes
since the moment we arrived

48:30.690 --> 48:32.355
and now they are
trying to kill us.

48:32.357 --> 48:34.190
This goes a lot farther
than just being angry

48:34.192 --> 48:35.659
about losing their jobs.

48:35.661 --> 48:37.295
Cap, we've been
pelted by hockey pucks,

48:37.297 --> 48:38.895
had dicks tugged
in front of our faces

48:38.897 --> 48:41.498
and gotten our asses kicked
by prostitutes of both sexes.

48:41.500 --> 48:43.934
I think it's time we had
our own fun. Who's with me?

48:43.936 --> 48:45.203
Yeah! Let's go!

48:45.205 --> 48:47.804
Dude, you fuckin' stink.

48:47.806 --> 48:48.942
Sorry.

48:49.775 --> 48:53.643
Guys! Guys! Anyone?

48:53.645 --> 48:55.880
The shaving cream
is starting to burn.

48:55.882 --> 48:57.114
Did you use menthol?!

48:57.116 --> 48:59.884
<i>Hair loss,
queefing and bitchiness.</i>

48:59.886 --> 49:02.619
<i>Flova Scotia, eh?</i>

49:02.621 --> 49:05.655
Fuckin' rights.
It's the same guy, bud.

49:05.657 --> 49:08.358
No, no, no. It's
a different guy, that guy, eh.

49:08.360 --> 49:10.460
Yeah, no!
That's Danny DeVito!

49:10.462 --> 49:13.230
Danny DeVito
is the actor from <i>Taxi,</i>

49:13.232 --> 49:14.565
but that guy I like,

49:14.567 --> 49:17.300
he come out on <i>Always
Sunny in Philadelphia's.</i>

49:17.302 --> 49:18.636
Bud, they're the same guy.

49:18.638 --> 49:20.603
How many 145-centimeter actors
do you think there are?

49:20.605 --> 49:22.172
They're both Danny DeVito!

49:23.342 --> 49:25.742
No, Danny DeVito
<i>Taxi</i> long time ago.

49:25.744 --> 49:28.612
But this producer
from <i>Always Sunnys,</i>

49:28.614 --> 49:30.480
they like him so much,

49:30.482 --> 49:32.882
they put him it
into the show, eh.

49:32.884 --> 49:35.351
That doesn't mean they
can't be the same guy, bud.

49:35.353 --> 49:36.786
That's one guy.
It's a different era.

49:36.788 --> 49:38.654
He can do two shows
in fucking 30 years.

49:38.656 --> 49:40.623
How many times
do we have to go over this?

49:40.625 --> 49:42.527
It's the same fucking guy!

49:44.764 --> 49:47.931
He is right, you know.
It is the same guy.

49:47.933 --> 49:49.933
Danny DeVito was in <i>Taxis</i>

49:49.935 --> 49:52.871
but he is also in <i>It's Always
Sunny in Philadelphia's.</i>

49:53.538 --> 49:55.405
I know. I make joke on him.

49:55.407 --> 49:58.241
He think I don't know
but I know, eh.

50:01.013 --> 50:03.947
You know who is my favorite,
uh, superhero villain?

50:03.949 --> 50:06.449
Is the Penguin
from <i>Batman</i> film, eh.

50:06.451 --> 50:08.853
That's fuckin'
Danny DeVito, bud.

50:08.855 --> 50:10.154
Get a fucking clue!

50:10.156 --> 50:11.721
That's Danny DeVito
you just said!

50:11.723 --> 50:13.357
Can you believe
this fuckin' guy doesn't know

50:13.359 --> 50:14.424
who Danny DeVito is?

50:14.426 --> 50:15.692
Who you mean? The singer?

50:15.694 --> 50:18.429
No, the fuckin' actor!
Danny DeVito.

50:18.431 --> 50:20.463
The guy who's married
to Rhea Perlman!

50:20.465 --> 50:22.299
Oh, I like him in <i>Hellboy.</i>

50:22.301 --> 50:23.735
That's Ron Perlman!

50:23.737 --> 50:26.837
Doesn't matter. Archambault!
Hockey is back on!

50:26.839 --> 50:28.137
What the fuck is wrong
with you guys?

50:28.139 --> 50:29.873
Both of you. You're fucki''
from another planet.

50:29.875 --> 50:31.675
I can't believe we live
in the same country.

50:31.677 --> 50:33.043
Oh, the fucking phone

50:33.045 --> 50:34.578
is ringing during
hockey night in Canada!

50:34.580 --> 50:36.612
Who is calling during
hockey night in Canada?!

50:36.614 --> 50:38.782
Who the fuck even has
a hard line anymore?

50:38.784 --> 50:41.351
Archambault, rip the fuckin'
phone out of the wall!

50:41.353 --> 50:42.587
What's next?
You're gonna have someone

50:42.589 --> 50:44.654
deliver a pizza during
the fuckin' overtime?!

50:47.259 --> 50:48.893
What the fuck?

50:55.701 --> 50:57.701
You know,
the other guy I like,

50:57.703 --> 50:59.536
is the one
giving Billy Crystal

50:59.538 --> 51:01.940
the problem in
<i>Throw Momma and the Trains.</i>

51:04.810 --> 51:06.679
Holy <i>merde.</i>

51:21.527 --> 51:22.729
Get him!

51:35.074 --> 51:36.440
Great fight, guys!

51:36.442 --> 51:39.242
Pennyworth ADH4
SureShot Cattle Prod.

51:39.244 --> 51:40.444
Every station needs one.

51:42.447 --> 51:44.451
I can't breathe.

52:01.100 --> 52:04.000
We know it's you guys.
We can see your mustaches.

52:04.002 --> 52:05.869
Come on, you can't
leave us out here.

52:05.871 --> 52:08.739
We are at least
100 <i>kilomètres</i> in the woods!

52:08.741 --> 52:10.143
Maybe more, huh?

52:16.714 --> 52:19.518
Ah, <i>tabernacle.</i>
Here come the mosquito.

52:24.522 --> 52:25.755
We got 24 hours

52:25.757 --> 52:27.925
to desecrate the good names
of these dickfucks.

52:27.927 --> 52:30.194
Let's do it!

52:35.235 --> 52:37.070
Let's do it.

52:40.906 --> 52:43.076
License and registration, eh!

52:44.243 --> 52:45.241
Here you go.

52:45.243 --> 52:46.610
<i>Captain, come in, Captain.</i>

52:46.612 --> 52:48.445
- Officer.
- <i>Captain, come in.</i>

52:48.447 --> 52:50.181
Officer, here you go.

52:50.183 --> 52:51.482
<i>Are you hearing
anything, Captain?</i>

52:51.484 --> 52:52.815
You think maybe
your buddy is getting

52:52.817 --> 52:54.888
a little old for this?
I mean, a deaf cop?

52:55.388 --> 52:57.288
Who said that, eh?

52:57.290 --> 53:00.623
Ooh. You, sir,
have the nose of a king.

53:00.625 --> 53:03.393
Hold tight, I'm gonna
get my ticket book.

53:04.831 --> 53:06.563
Ya! Hey there.

53:06.565 --> 53:08.498

- All right.

53:08.500 --> 53:10.366
Let's go!
License and registration, eh!

53:11.569 --> 53:12.636
What's so funny...

53:12.638 --> 53:15.304
...Mr. Matt Tomon?

53:15.306 --> 53:16.373
You think it's funny that

53:16.375 --> 53:17.875
I lost my balls
in a tractor pull?

53:17.877 --> 53:19.677
Wait, you both
got your nuts ripped off

53:19.679 --> 53:20.811
in a tractor pull?

53:20.813 --> 53:22.645
I lost mine in the spokes
of my bicycle.

53:22.647 --> 53:24.616
You know how fast
that will stop a bicycle?

53:26.752 --> 53:28.418
Hey, Officer!

53:28.420 --> 53:30.820
- Hey, you're on my wagon.
- What?

53:30.822 --> 53:33.989
Come on! Wake up! Wake up!

53:33.991 --> 53:35.827

53:37.395 --> 53:39.628
'Scuse me one second, eh.

53:39.630 --> 53:41.030

53:41.032 --> 53:43.002
- Get back here, you!
- Ow! Ow!

53:45.237 --> 53:47.204
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

53:47.206 --> 53:49.273
License and registration.

53:49.275 --> 53:52.509
Aren't you the two
that pulled me over before?

53:52.511 --> 53:53.811
Beg your pardon?

53:53.813 --> 53:57.447
How are you Mounties now?
Or should I say Meow-nties?

53:57.449 --> 53:59.083
Say what now?

53:59.085 --> 54:01.116
Few years ago,
you pulled me over

54:01.118 --> 54:03.219
and you played some game
where you said "meow."

54:03.221 --> 54:05.221
Buddy, I've said
a thousand stupid things

54:05.223 --> 54:06.422
to people over the years.

54:06.424 --> 54:08.090
You asked if I saw you
jumping around

54:08.092 --> 54:10.793
all nimbly-bimbly
from tree to tree?

54:10.795 --> 54:12.962
I can assure you
I've never said the words

54:12.964 --> 54:15.431
"nimbly-bimbly"
in my life.

54:15.433 --> 54:17.101
- You fucker!
- Oh, you bitch!

54:18.469 --> 54:20.570
Where's the gosh darn cruiser?

54:21.806 --> 54:23.674
Dude, your partner
is about to get mucked!

54:23.676 --> 54:25.641
Where you going, mister?
Freeze!

54:28.346 --> 54:29.381
Ow. Ow!

54:36.422 --> 54:38.288
Bro!

54:38.290 --> 54:40.324
Hang on. Do you really
not remember this guy

54:40.326 --> 54:41.458
or you just fuckin' with him?

54:41.460 --> 54:42.659
Yeah,
I have no idea who he is.

54:42.661 --> 54:43.994
You know I heard
everything you said.

54:43.996 --> 54:45.728
Son of a bitch. We've been
doing that for years.

54:45.730 --> 54:47.898
Forget it. Am I getting
a ticket here, or...

54:47.900 --> 54:49.199
You know what? I want
to get my head around this

54:49.201 --> 54:50.800
'cause now
it's driving me crazy.

54:50.802 --> 54:52.770
Let's do this. We'll switch.
You'll be me, I'll be you

54:52.772 --> 54:54.170
and then
you'll do the routine.

54:54.172 --> 54:55.072
What? All right.

54:55.074 --> 54:56.709
Ah, you'll kill it,
you'll kill it.

54:58.310 --> 55:01.911
License and registration meow.
Come on, meow.

55:01.913 --> 55:04.280
Hey! Now I remember it!

55:04.282 --> 55:06.382
- I remember it now.
- You remember that.

55:06.384 --> 55:08.686
In the meanwhile, never give
your car keys to a stranger.

55:08.688 --> 55:09.786
Why is that?

55:09.788 --> 55:11.755
See you, sucker!

55:11.757 --> 55:14.991
I knew it was you
the whole time, asshole!

55:14.993 --> 55:17.293
What
the hell's going on here? Huh?

55:17.295 --> 55:19.797
Looks like someone's smoking
the reefer joints.

55:19.799 --> 55:21.197
No, that's not marijuana.

55:21.199 --> 55:22.366
We'll see about that.

55:22.368 --> 55:24.067
Farva, that's not a good idea!

55:26.237 --> 55:27.304
What's the...

55:29.741 --> 55:31.009
Okay, this is happening.

55:38.016 --> 55:39.215
Sorry.

55:41.554 --> 55:42.619
We're from America.

55:42.621 --> 55:43.887
We don't speak French.

55:43.889 --> 55:44.924
Oh.

55:50.429 --> 55:51.895
Do neither of you
speak English?

55:51.897 --> 55:53.563
- I do.
- Oh.

55:53.565 --> 55:55.398
Em...

55:55.400 --> 55:56.900
Your papers.

55:56.902 --> 56:00.904
We would like
to eat your papers.

56:00.906 --> 56:03.940
Can you
show me your party papers?

56:03.942 --> 56:06.409
- You want to see our party papers?
- Party papers?

56:06.411 --> 56:07.878
<i>Bon vivant bouillabaisse,</i>

56:34.373 --> 56:35.672
No, no, no, no, no.

56:35.674 --> 56:38.775
I must apologize, uh,
for me and my partner.

56:38.777 --> 56:40.177
We should not fight.

56:40.179 --> 56:42.277
To argue is no way
to go through the life.

56:42.279 --> 56:43.279
I know.

56:43.281 --> 56:45.449
- Do you know the key to life?
- What's that?

56:45.451 --> 56:47.753
The key to life is a...

56:48.386 --> 56:50.954
a penis in your asshole.

56:50.956 --> 56:53.223
I beg your pardon, sir!

56:53.225 --> 56:55.458
I think you must be
saying that wrong!

56:55.460 --> 57:00.130
No, no, no. The key to life
is a penis in your asshole.

57:00.132 --> 57:02.666
I don't think you're saying
what you mean to say.

57:02.668 --> 57:03.866
<i>Oui! Oui! Oui!</i>

57:03.868 --> 57:05.101
A penis. A penis.

57:05.103 --> 57:08.174
You know, eh, eh, to smile.
To be happy.

57:08.440 --> 57:10.007
Oh!

57:10.009 --> 57:12.241
"Happiness!"

57:12.243 --> 57:13.744
Honey! It's...

57:13.746 --> 57:15.179
Okay.

57:15.181 --> 57:16.816
In your asshole.

57:17.482 --> 57:18.581
That's...

57:18.583 --> 57:20.849
Your asshole.
Eh, where you live.

57:20.851 --> 57:23.520
Your apartment,
your domicile.

57:23.522 --> 57:24.920
Your house.

57:24.922 --> 57:26.290
- "Household!"
- Ah!

57:26.292 --> 57:29.759
"The key to life is happiness
in your household!"

57:29.761 --> 57:32.295
<i>Oui,</i> the key to life is
"a penis in your asshole"!

57:32.297 --> 57:34.264
- Oh!
- I'm trying to tell her that.

57:38.670 --> 57:40.237
What you think I say?

57:40.239 --> 57:41.704
Oh, I don't even
want to tell you.

57:41.706 --> 57:43.607
Maybe they'll get
a kick out of it.

57:43.609 --> 57:45.409
We thought that you said,

57:45.411 --> 57:50.346
that the key to life
is a penis in your asshole.

57:50.348 --> 57:52.315
<i>Sacrebleu, non!</i>

57:52.317 --> 57:54.717
You Americans think
everyone want to fuck you!

57:54.719 --> 57:56.686
No one want to fuck you!

57:56.688 --> 57:58.087
<i>Merde!</i>

57:58.089 --> 58:00.225
Here is your party papers!

58:00.958 --> 58:03.326
I thought Canadians were nice.

58:03.328 --> 58:05.661
Whoa! Whoa! Wait for me.
Okay.

58:06.831 --> 58:07.998
I was thinking
we could do like

58:08.000 --> 58:09.266
a "Who's on First?" pullover.

58:09.268 --> 58:11.936
"Rabbit and Fostello."
You know, old-time comedy.

58:11.938 --> 58:13.139
- Love it.
- Ooh.

58:16.007 --> 58:18.342
- How are they back so quick?
- Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

58:18.344 --> 58:19.378
- Shit!
- Go, go, go, go!

58:27.853 --> 58:29.619
There are these
son-of-a-bitch guys, eh!

58:29.621 --> 58:31.355
Stomp you a new mudhole!

58:31.357 --> 58:32.288
Whoa, whoa!

58:32.290 --> 58:34.123
What the hell happened
to you guys?

58:34.125 --> 58:35.992
They dump us in the woods!

58:35.994 --> 58:37.828
What?! Why would we do that?
We're the police.

58:37.830 --> 58:39.262
Too bad for you
my dad dropped me in the woods

58:39.264 --> 58:41.431
- naked every summer!
- Hah?

58:41.433 --> 58:42.831
Oh, sounds too bad for you.

58:42.833 --> 58:44.735
Come on. You know you do this.
Look at us.

58:44.737 --> 58:47.103
We are paint all red,
white and blue.

58:47.105 --> 58:48.771
Aren't those the colors
of the French flag?

58:48.773 --> 58:50.907
Oh, the
color the French flag.

58:50.909 --> 58:52.041
Perhaps the guys
who did this were British.

58:52.043 --> 58:53.576
Could've been Costa Rican.

58:53.578 --> 58:55.311
Who wants breakfast burritos?

58:57.616 --> 58:58.482
Take that off
or I'll kill you.

58:58.484 --> 59:00.016
Let's settle this
the Canadian way!

59:00.018 --> 59:01.284
You're in America now!

59:03.556 --> 59:06.056
Hey! What's going on here?

59:06.058 --> 59:08.425
Great Tim Horton's ghost!

59:08.427 --> 59:10.293
First, I get a call
that the Mounties

59:10.295 --> 59:12.228
are out farting sideways
on the highways.

59:12.230 --> 59:13.864
Then I get a call
to come down here.

59:13.866 --> 59:15.065
Oh, it wasn't us!

59:15.067 --> 59:17.067
These fucking guys,
they kidnap us

59:17.069 --> 59:18.500
and they leave us
in the woods to die.

59:18.502 --> 59:21.570
Yeah, then they steal
all three of our uniform, eh.

59:21.572 --> 59:24.340
These guys put a bear in our station!
A real bear. Big bear!

59:24.342 --> 59:26.842
You don't have
any proof of that.

59:26.844 --> 59:27.976
A real bear?

59:27.978 --> 59:30.848
Maybe. And maybe
they deserve a bear!

59:30.850 --> 59:32.181
Nobody deserves a bear!

59:32.183 --> 59:33.784
I give a bear to you!

59:33.786 --> 59:35.655
We could have been eaten!

59:37.922 --> 59:40.223
Why you laughing, Guy?

59:40.225 --> 59:43.994
Fellas, you are thinking
about this all wrong, eh?

59:43.996 --> 59:47.266
These guys?
They impersonated officers.

59:48.366 --> 59:51.099
There is no way they're
holding onto their jobs.

59:51.101 --> 59:53.469
And I'll do you one better.

59:53.471 --> 59:56.706
When I get done talking to my
good friend Justin Trudeau...

59:56.708 --> 59:58.108
Eh, the Prime Minister!

59:58.110 --> 59:59.842
I bet you this
whole turnover thing

59:59.844 --> 01:00:01.210
goes right out the window.

01:00:01.212 --> 01:00:02.378
Boom!

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.848
So, boys, unpack your bags.
Revive those cable bundles.

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:06.549
'Cause you are
not going anywhere.

01:00:06.551 --> 01:00:08.717
I say we celebrate. What are
we having for breakfast?

01:00:08.719 --> 01:00:10.887
- Pancake.
- Pancake, yeah?

01:00:10.889 --> 01:00:12.389
All right.
Oatmeal and raisins it is.

01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:14.456
- Oh.
- Kidding. It's pancakes.

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:17.561
Eh, pancake! Maybe two eggs
side by each, eh?

01:00:17.563 --> 01:00:18.728
I don't want this oatmeal.

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:20.967
Maybe you put the
raisins inside the pancake.

01:00:21.866 --> 01:00:23.366
Genevieve, wait.

01:00:23.368 --> 01:00:25.634
You brought this
on yourselves.

01:00:25.636 --> 01:00:27.105
They put a bear...

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.007
This is bad, fellas.

01:00:31.009 --> 01:00:34.244
This is "Fred Savage
Ridin'-Along Incident" bad.

01:00:34.246 --> 01:00:35.779
Tell that to Fred Savage.

01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:38.348
Well, no sense in having
good breakfast go to waste.

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:39.715
- I've lost my appetite.
- I'm sorry, man.

01:00:39.717 --> 01:00:41.351
I'm just not hungry.

01:00:41.353 --> 01:00:43.319
You try to do something
nice for people,

01:00:43.321 --> 01:00:45.725
and then it just,
I just, you know.

01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:48.226
What's the point?

01:00:49.194 --> 01:00:52.362
Stop taking
female hormones!

01:00:52.364 --> 01:00:53.630
<i>♪ Makin' money ♪</i>

01:00:53.632 --> 01:00:55.065
<i>♪ Makin' dollars,
makin' money ♪</i>

01:00:55.067 --> 01:00:56.433
Can we
please come in, Cap?

01:00:56.435 --> 01:00:58.835
He's taking years off my life.

01:00:58.837 --> 01:01:00.402
<i>Just the bad years, kid.</i>

01:01:00.404 --> 01:01:02.471
I'm serious, Cap. I'm about to snap like a dry twig.

01:01:02.473 --> 01:01:05.175
<i>Things are still pretty dicey here.
Best keep Farva away.</i>

01:01:05.177 --> 01:01:07.344
<i>We'll let you know
when the coast is clear.</i>

01:01:10.449 --> 01:01:12.648
Have you
heard the new Kanye?

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:15.552
He's not just about big butts!
He's a really good singer.

01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:20.324
This is great. It's like
being on the road again.

01:01:20.326 --> 01:01:22.858
I like to chew mint gum
when I'm on the road.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.226
When I'm radio, it's fruit.

01:01:24.228 --> 01:01:27.498
You know, like Juicy Fruit,
Bubblicious, Hubba Bubba.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.065
Anything fruity.

01:01:29.067 --> 01:01:30.333
On the road,
I like mint, though.

01:01:30.335 --> 01:01:32.835
Mint, mint, mint, mint, mint.

01:01:32.837 --> 01:01:34.536
And Beech-Nut,
have you tried that?

01:01:34.538 --> 01:01:36.273
They should call it
"Beech-Not!"

01:01:36.275 --> 01:01:38.907
Oh, shit, I'm gonna
write that down.

01:01:38.909 --> 01:01:40.809
What kind of gum do you chew?

01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:42.281
They should make
a black mint gum.

01:01:42.947 --> 01:01:44.114
That would be choice.

01:01:44.116 --> 01:01:46.315
They could call it
"Minty Black".

01:01:46.317 --> 01:01:47.884
Yeah, I'm gonna
write that down too.

01:01:47.886 --> 01:01:49.753
- No one would buy that.
- What?

01:01:49.755 --> 01:01:51.223
No one would buy
that stupid gum.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.159
Bullshit.

01:01:56.161 --> 01:01:58.962
They'd buy it
if it was on <i>Friends.</i>

01:01:58.964 --> 01:02:00.197
Like if Ross
or Rachel chewed it,

01:02:00.199 --> 01:02:01.598
it'd sell like hotcakes.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.933
Are you a mutant?

01:02:02.935 --> 01:02:04.867
You follow me out here while I'm
pissing just to tell me this shit?

01:02:04.869 --> 01:02:06.235
Quit looking at my dick.

01:02:06.237 --> 01:02:07.469
I'm not looking at your dick.
We're taking a piss.

01:02:07.471 --> 01:02:09.139
- So, piss.
- I don't have to go.

01:02:11.643 --> 01:02:13.844
I'll fuck that Canadian
right in his back bacon!

01:02:13.846 --> 01:02:14.847
Rod! Rod!

01:02:18.384 --> 01:02:20.384
- Yeah!
- Farva!

01:02:20.386 --> 01:02:22.487
Farva!

01:02:23.587 --> 01:02:24.788
Farva!

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.428
Dumb fuck.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.635
Unbelievable.

01:02:37.603 --> 01:02:39.703
Who pops an airbag?

01:02:39.705 --> 01:02:41.507
God. You weigh a ton.

01:02:44.877 --> 01:02:47.179
You gotta be shitting me.
Don't die on me, Farva.

01:02:49.081 --> 01:02:50.416
Okay. You can do it.

01:03:06.531 --> 01:03:07.565
Oh! Fuck!

01:03:08.032 --> 01:03:09.132
From upside down,

01:03:09.134 --> 01:03:11.201
your mustache looks
like a big hairy smile.

01:03:11.203 --> 01:03:12.436
Why would you
give me the Shocker?

01:03:12.438 --> 01:03:15.304
My way of saying, "Thanks,
honey. You saved my life."

01:03:15.306 --> 01:03:17.306
I was dead. I went to Heaven.

01:03:17.308 --> 01:03:18.574
And you were there.

01:03:18.576 --> 01:03:20.944
- You know what you were doing?
- What?

01:03:20.946 --> 01:03:24.148
Trying to make out with me,
sweetheart! I'm on to you.

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:26.717
Come here.
Give me some more of that.

01:03:27.819 --> 01:03:28.888
What the hell is that?

01:03:35.793 --> 01:03:37.629
Well, hello, Laverne!

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:39.829
Looks like the same stuff.

01:03:39.831 --> 01:03:41.766
Yeah, but a shit-ton
more of it.

01:03:43.802 --> 01:03:45.567
Holy Hindu holidays.

01:03:45.569 --> 01:03:47.238
There's a new guest
at the party.

01:03:48.206 --> 01:03:50.176
AK-47s.

01:03:54.612 --> 01:03:55.545
Hey.

01:03:55.547 --> 01:03:57.279
Oh, no, I don't
want to hear it, Rabbit.

01:03:57.281 --> 01:03:59.081
Genevieve,
could I just explain?

01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:00.817
There is nothing to explain.

01:04:00.819 --> 01:04:02.585
They put bears
in our station.

01:04:02.587 --> 01:04:03.820
This is Canada!

01:04:03.822 --> 01:04:05.420
There are bears everywhere.

01:04:05.422 --> 01:04:06.822
There are bears that
go through

01:04:06.824 --> 01:04:07.824
my garbage every night.

01:04:07.826 --> 01:04:10.559
I have cereal
with bears in it: Bearios.

01:04:10.561 --> 01:04:12.628
Canada's most
popular breakfast.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:14.130
Someone say "Bearios"?

01:04:14.132 --> 01:04:17.300
Hey there, Genny.
Wanna grab some eats?

01:04:17.302 --> 01:04:18.668
No, thanks.

01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:22.070
Turn that into a maybe
and I'll have your baby.

01:04:24.076 --> 01:04:25.641
Lonnie Laloush?

01:04:25.643 --> 01:04:28.478
That's <i>mon nom.</i>
Don't wear it out, eh?

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.114
You want a hot coffee?
I'm pouring.

01:04:31.116 --> 01:04:33.183
<i>Oui, s'il te plait.</i>

01:04:33.185 --> 01:04:34.851
Seems like a real
"dickwa-duh", huh?

01:04:34.853 --> 01:04:38.221
I told everyone
how wonderful you all are.

01:04:38.223 --> 01:04:41.456
Well, you're not.
You have bad hearts.

01:04:41.458 --> 01:04:42.828
Who wants crème fraiche?

01:04:43.828 --> 01:04:44.962
Nobody?

01:04:46.297 --> 01:04:48.399
Okay, no crème fraiche!

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.233
- Please just go.
- Genevieve...

01:04:51.235 --> 01:04:52.770
Just go.

01:05:02.181 --> 01:05:05.449
They're actually AK-48s.
Illegal in the U.S.

01:05:05.451 --> 01:05:06.581
Why 48?

01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:09.819
Because they hold
one extra bullet.

01:05:09.821 --> 01:05:10.686
Yeah, sure. You never know

01:05:10.688 --> 01:05:12.221
when you're gonna
need just one more.

01:05:12.223 --> 01:05:13.590
This one says "Tiger Penis".

01:05:13.592 --> 01:05:14.724
Suck it!

01:05:14.726 --> 01:05:15.558
Shut up, Farva.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.393
The Chinese use it
to get hard-ons.

01:05:17.395 --> 01:05:18.762
I tried to get it once.

01:05:18.764 --> 01:05:20.332
You can't buy it in the United States.

01:05:22.299 --> 01:05:24.067
Dude, what's up
with your mustache?

01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:25.271
Nothing.

01:05:27.371 --> 01:05:29.105
- Are you wearing a mustache wig?
- No!

01:05:29.107 --> 01:05:31.407
It's a postiche, okay?
I'm having a little hair loss.

01:05:31.409 --> 01:05:32.476
Don't worry about it.

01:05:32.478 --> 01:05:34.710
Worry about your
own goddamn mustache.

01:05:34.712 --> 01:05:35.878
Fuckin' asshole.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.947
Hey, Mac tell you guys
about our little moment?

01:05:37.949 --> 01:05:39.715
Did you, Mac and Cheese?

01:05:39.717 --> 01:05:42.085
You told us, Farva.
I don't want to hear it again.

01:05:42.087 --> 01:05:43.485
I'm the Cheese.

01:05:43.487 --> 01:05:44.587
All right, look, guys.

01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:46.054
I know we're
in some serious shit here,

01:05:46.056 --> 01:05:47.290
but if we can crack this case,

01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:48.525
we might just be able to get

01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:49.893
beyond this
whole Mountie thing.

01:05:49.895 --> 01:05:51.226
We didn't do anything.

01:05:51.228 --> 01:05:52.429
Foster, we kidnapped
and impersonated

01:05:52.431 --> 01:05:53.866
officers of
a sovereign nation.

01:05:54.299 --> 01:05:55.565
Right.

01:05:55.567 --> 01:05:58.567
Cuban cigars, Canadian pills,
counterfeit cell phones,

01:05:58.569 --> 01:06:00.235
AK-48s and Tiger Penis.

01:06:00.237 --> 01:06:01.971
What's the link?

01:06:01.973 --> 01:06:04.773
All this stuff is
more valuable in the U.S.

01:06:04.775 --> 01:06:05.708
than in Canada.

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:07.110
So, it's
a smuggling operation.

01:06:07.112 --> 01:06:09.011
Someone's trying to move
this shit over the border.

01:06:09.013 --> 01:06:10.049
No, they're not.

01:06:11.016 --> 01:06:12.148
Think about it.

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:13.782
This stuff is just sitting on
Canadian land. Yeah. Okay.

01:06:13.784 --> 01:06:16.085
But what happens
when this Canadian land

01:06:16.087 --> 01:06:17.654
becomes American land?

01:06:17.656 --> 01:06:21.324
No need to move it at all.
It's already on U.S. soil.

01:06:21.326 --> 01:06:22.724
Exactly, huh?

01:06:22.726 --> 01:06:25.529
Passive smuggling.
It's my kind of crime.

01:06:25.531 --> 01:06:28.163
So, they must have this shit
stashed all along the border.

01:06:28.165 --> 01:06:29.800
Yeah. But who is "they"?

01:06:29.802 --> 01:06:31.333
Who "are" they.

01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:32.434
Hey, look,
I said this earlier

01:06:32.436 --> 01:06:33.835
and you guys laughed at me.

01:06:33.837 --> 01:06:37.040
But I think it's the Mounties.
They are shit people. Okay?

01:06:37.042 --> 01:06:39.007
And they smoke Cubans cigars.
We've seen that.

01:06:39.009 --> 01:06:41.043
They're getting transferred
to God knows where.

01:06:41.045 --> 01:06:42.244
I mean, what
do they have to lose?

01:06:42.246 --> 01:06:45.614
I am starting to agree with
Sherlock McSerpico over here.

01:06:45.616 --> 01:06:47.049
Ooh!

01:06:47.051 --> 01:06:48.751
I'm telling you, fellas.

01:06:48.753 --> 01:06:50.619
In my experience,
it's always the local cops.

01:06:50.621 --> 01:06:52.621
What would you guys give me
if I kill that bird?

01:06:52.623 --> 01:06:54.257
Farva, that's a Bald Eagle!

01:06:54.259 --> 01:06:55.391
Get a wig, baldy!

01:06:58.395 --> 01:07:00.130
Yeah!

01:07:00.132 --> 01:07:01.530
Put the goddamn gun down.

01:07:01.532 --> 01:07:03.632
What?

01:07:03.634 --> 01:07:06.235
Oh, booyah!
Guys, what do I win?

01:07:06.237 --> 01:07:08.204
A one-way ticket to hell.

01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:15.578
This place wishes
it was Shenanigans.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.014
Welcome to Chicanery's, eh!

01:07:17.616 --> 01:07:18.748
Can I get you a booth?

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:21.183
Uh, no. We're meeting
somebody here.

01:07:21.185 --> 01:07:22.351
Oh, yeah, there he is.

Yeah, we got

01:08:04.328 --> 01:08:05.494
get yourself a free dessert.

01:08:05.496 --> 01:08:07.199
Bring them all.
Bring them all right now.

01:08:08.465 --> 01:08:10.166
Bring all ten liters
and the punch card.

01:08:10.168 --> 01:08:11.203
I want it all right now.

01:08:13.337 --> 01:08:14.404
Come on.

01:08:14.406 --> 01:08:15.938
Canada's pretty awesome.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.140
- Boop boop.
- Uh, don't do that.

01:08:18.142 --> 01:08:20.879
- Boop beep boo boop beep.
- Cut the crap.

01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:29.551
Genevieve?

01:08:29.553 --> 01:08:32.956
I feel terrible
about what I said to you.

01:08:32.957 --> 01:08:34.991
I know I overreacted.

01:08:34.993 --> 01:08:38.461
It's just the town is so upset
about the turnover.

01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:39.528
Sure.

01:08:39.529 --> 01:08:41.630
Anyway,
you are not a bad person.

01:08:41.631 --> 01:08:43.433
Even if you are American.

01:08:44.803 --> 01:08:46.536
Well, I've actually been
working on that for you.

01:08:46.537 --> 01:08:47.670
- For me?
- Yeah.

01:08:47.671 --> 01:08:50.305
Moosehead. Canadian beer.

01:08:50.308 --> 01:08:52.375
Beaver chili.
<i>Très Canadien.</i>

01:08:53.544 --> 01:08:55.747
And I've been working
on my French too.

01:08:58.417 --> 01:09:01.082
Oh, I love this song!

01:09:01.085 --> 01:09:05.220
Oh, it reminds me of summers
on <i>Etang de la Soupe Aux Pois.</i>

01:09:19.504 --> 01:09:22.305
Wow! That's very good.

01:09:22.307 --> 01:09:24.506
Oh, I wouldn't say that, but,

01:09:24.508 --> 01:09:25.774
I don't even know
what it means.

01:09:25.776 --> 01:09:29.514
It's a sad song about
the Nazi Occupation of France.

01:09:30.848 --> 01:09:32.180
Oh.

01:09:32.182 --> 01:09:33.416
I'm sorry. I...

01:09:33.417 --> 01:09:34.649
No. No, no.

01:09:34.651 --> 01:09:36.286
It's about two lovers

01:09:36.287 --> 01:09:39.622
trapped in a war
that neither wanted,

01:09:39.624 --> 01:09:42.661
but they love
each other anyway.

01:09:43.227 --> 01:09:44.394
Oh.

01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:46.732
So much better.

01:09:59.576 --> 01:10:01.178
- Is this really happening?
- Oh, yes.

01:10:03.013 --> 01:10:04.246
I love it.

01:10:05.717 --> 01:10:06.849
Wait, wait, wait.

01:10:06.851 --> 01:10:08.951
- Where is the fat one's desk?
- Right there.

01:10:08.953 --> 01:10:10.118
Okay.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.453
You don't know his name?

01:10:11.455 --> 01:10:12.889
Flarvla.

01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:14.826
I smell a new nickname.

01:10:15.526 --> 01:10:17.094
Guess we hurry.

01:10:23.801 --> 01:10:25.900
Passive smuggling?
It's brilliant.

01:10:25.902 --> 01:10:27.202
And it's gotta
be the Mounties.

01:10:27.204 --> 01:10:28.104
Why?

01:10:28.106 --> 01:10:30.105
'Cause it's always
the local cops.

01:10:30.107 --> 01:10:31.172
Here's your punch card.

01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:35.644
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:10:35.646 --> 01:10:37.980
Number nine. This is ten.

01:10:37.982 --> 01:10:40.616
Technically, you have to drink
all ten to get the dessert.

01:10:40.618 --> 01:10:41.684
Oh, you challenging me?

01:10:41.686 --> 01:10:43.051
This will be gone
in three seconds.

01:10:43.053 --> 01:10:45.055
I'll have
the butter tart yule log.

01:10:45.057 --> 01:10:46.890
Come on. Chop-chop!

01:10:46.892 --> 01:10:48.794
Just do it, dude.

01:10:51.161 --> 01:10:52.729
Canada!

01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:54.029
And the beauty is,

01:10:54.031 --> 01:10:55.698
there's nothing they can do
with all that contraband,

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.533
until this land
becomes America.

01:10:57.535 --> 01:10:59.868
So all we have to do
is push back the turnover,

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:01.703
until we can find
the rest of the stuff.

01:11:01.705 --> 01:11:02.971
Well, you heard LeFranc.

01:11:02.973 --> 01:11:04.940
Who knows what's gonna happen
with the turnover?

01:11:04.942 --> 01:11:08.109
Whatever happens,
we gotta solve this case. Now.

01:11:08.111 --> 01:11:10.079
Let's take another look
at that contraband.

01:11:10.081 --> 01:11:12.547
We may have missed something.

01:11:12.549 --> 01:11:15.217
Hold on! I didn't
get my free dessert.

01:11:15.219 --> 01:11:16.284
Move it, Farva!

01:11:16.286 --> 01:11:18.354
Come on! It's a fucki''
butter tart yule log!

01:11:18.356 --> 01:11:20.523
Let's go! Now!

01:11:20.525 --> 01:11:21.759
Damn it.

01:11:24.161 --> 01:11:25.894
Oh! Whoa! Watch it, pal.

01:11:25.896 --> 01:11:28.032
Walk faster, finger blaster.

01:11:38.743 --> 01:11:40.743
Son of a... Rabbit!

01:11:40.745 --> 01:11:41.844
Whoa!

01:11:41.846 --> 01:11:43.845
Whoa!
The booty's gone!

01:11:43.847 --> 01:11:45.249
Did they take
the Flova Scotia?

01:11:46.383 --> 01:11:48.752
In addition to Rabbit!

01:11:48.754 --> 01:11:50.952
Hold your bones.
Rabbit's car.

01:11:50.954 --> 01:11:52.954
The dash cam! Look at this.

01:11:52.956 --> 01:11:54.591
Ooh, you clever
little prick, you.

01:11:54.593 --> 01:11:56.091
Prick? I'm tired
of these putdowns!

01:11:56.093 --> 01:11:57.659
It's a compliment,
shithead.

01:11:57.661 --> 01:12:00.031
Fuck you,
midget Burt Reynolds.

01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:03.869
- Mm.
- Mm-mm.

01:12:05.035 --> 01:12:07.269
Oh, a little ménage à two.

01:12:07.271 --> 01:12:08.907
Mm.

01:12:09.773 --> 01:12:11.474
- Ah.
- Yeah, partner.

01:12:13.311 --> 01:12:15.545
Can you believe she picked
Donnie Osmond over me?

01:12:15.547 --> 01:12:17.712
- Yes.
- I mean, is anyone else shocked here?

01:12:17.714 --> 01:12:19.081
- No.
- And on my desk?

01:12:19.083 --> 01:12:21.516
Shut up, Farva.
This is serious.

01:12:21.518 --> 01:12:23.485
- Whoa!
- What the fuck?

01:12:23.487 --> 01:12:24.988
Now how are
we gonna find them?

01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:27.590
All those iPhones
had the same number.

01:12:27.592 --> 01:12:29.591
Now, if we only
had a triangulator,

01:12:29.593 --> 01:12:30.828
we could locate them.

01:12:31.962 --> 01:12:34.863
Aha! Take that,
you bastards.

01:12:34.865 --> 01:12:36.698
Those are the
phones right there.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:37.935
Enhance.

01:12:38.937 --> 01:12:40.536
All right,
but what is this place?

01:12:40.538 --> 01:12:41.740
Enhance.

01:12:43.374 --> 01:12:45.541
- Enhance.
- Okay, okay.

01:12:45.543 --> 01:12:47.377
<i>"Sciere de la Vache."</i>

01:12:47.379 --> 01:12:49.511
All right, you guys speak
French, what does that mean?

01:12:49.513 --> 01:12:53.049
I don't
know what <i>sciere</i> means

01:12:53.051 --> 01:12:55.085
and I also don't know
what <i>vache</i> means.

01:12:55.087 --> 01:12:57.485
So you really don't
understand anything?

01:12:57.487 --> 01:12:58.822
<i>Sciere de la Vache?</i>

01:12:58.824 --> 01:13:01.323
I believe it's
"The Scary Vase".

01:13:01.325 --> 01:13:03.859
Yeah, yeah. Let's
see, <i>sciere</i> is "beetle".

01:13:03.861 --> 01:13:05.927
- Beetle vase. No. Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:05.929 --> 01:13:09.198
But <i>la vache</i> is "angry".
"Angry Beetle."

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.033
- Okay.
- Yeah. Angry Beetle, we think.

01:13:11.035 --> 01:13:14.170
It's "The Sawmill of the Cow",
you idiots!

01:13:14.172 --> 01:13:15.604
It's a sawmill!

01:13:15.606 --> 01:13:18.640
- Why "Sawmill of the Cow"? No.
- It doesn't make any sense.

01:13:18.642 --> 01:13:20.743
Let's go and give those
Canuckleheads

01:13:20.745 --> 01:13:23.113

01:13:24.214 --> 01:13:25.417
Yeah! Let's do it!

01:13:27.585 --> 01:13:28.887
Shotgun! Shotgun! Shotgun!

01:13:29.187 --> 01:13:30.188
Whoa!

01:13:40.798 --> 01:13:42.234
Shouldn't have drank
all that soda.

01:13:44.803 --> 01:13:46.034
You know, it just now
occurred to me,

01:13:46.036 --> 01:13:47.670
you and I have never been
alone together before.

01:13:47.672 --> 01:13:50.105
Yeah, thank God.

01:13:50.107 --> 01:13:52.875
Seriously. Have we ever had
a one-on-one conversation?

01:13:52.877 --> 01:13:55.080
Why would we? You seem
like a pretty boring dude.

01:13:56.681 --> 01:13:58.948

That was the turn, back there.

01:14:11.295 --> 01:14:13.328
Are you sure?
I don't think so.

01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:15.430
Have you completely lost
your sense of direction?

01:14:15.432 --> 01:14:18.000
Well, your yelling at me
certainly doesn't help!

01:14:18.002 --> 01:14:19.467
Cap's right, Thorn.
That was the turn.

01:14:19.469 --> 01:14:22.070
Shut up, Mr. Perfect.

01:15:11.054 --> 01:15:13.655
But I got two Mountie cars...

01:15:13.657 --> 01:15:16.558
and our contraband.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.629
Where the hell's Farva?

01:15:19.829 --> 01:15:21.565
Ah. I got him.

01:15:24.134 --> 01:15:27.202
He's like a walking
hydrothermal explosion.

01:15:27.204 --> 01:15:29.541
You want to see
some fartography?

01:15:31.674 --> 01:15:32.808
I'm still gonna go back

01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:34.346
and get that
butter tart yule log.

01:15:35.279 --> 01:15:38.215
All right, boys.
Let's milk this cow.

01:15:45.824 --> 01:15:47.055
I moved this
stuff the last time.

01:15:47.057 --> 01:15:48.823
I don't
want to lift it either.

01:15:48.825 --> 01:15:50.059
You don't move anything.

01:15:50.061 --> 01:15:52.330
You don't move your body,
you don't move boxes.

01:15:54.031 --> 01:15:55.566
One, two, three, go!

01:16:00.105 --> 01:16:01.369
Alright freeze!
You're under arrest!

01:16:01.371 --> 01:16:03.739
Bullshit, eh!
You're under arrest!

01:16:03.741 --> 01:16:05.140
Bullshit,

01:16:05.142 --> 01:16:07.042

Wait, wait, wait.
The old-timey one is right.

01:16:16.853 --> 01:16:18.690
Something doesn't add up here.

01:16:21.157 --> 01:16:23.326

Go on, kill each other.

01:16:47.284 --> 01:16:50.018

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.621
Uh, what the shit, Guy?

01:16:51.623 --> 01:16:54.088
Why you tell us these guys
are the smuggler, huh?

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:55.625
Well, it's a lot smarter
than telling you

01:16:55.627 --> 01:16:56.958
that I'm the smuggler.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.127
What do you mean,
you're the smuggler?

01:16:59.129 --> 01:17:01.829
I'm sorry, but what else
was I gonna do?

01:17:01.831 --> 01:17:03.998

of a small Canadian town

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.333
sounds romantic and cool.

01:17:05.335 --> 01:17:07.168
Being the mayor

You got to admit it's a good scam.

01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:13.842
All along the borderline.

01:17:13.844 --> 01:17:15.144
But I never would've
thought that

01:17:15.146 --> 01:17:17.246
the guys from
the Fred Savage incident,

01:17:17.248 --> 01:17:19.181
would be the ones
to trip me up.

01:17:19.183 --> 01:17:21.216
These are the cops
that killed Fred Savage?

01:17:21.218 --> 01:17:22.417
Sadly.

01:17:22.419 --> 01:17:27.055
But I will say, this little
rivalry between police forces,

01:17:27.057 --> 01:17:29.158
is the perfect opportunity
to take you both out.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.725
Well, now we're taking you in.

01:17:30.727 --> 01:17:32.127
I'm sorry.

01:17:32.129 --> 01:17:34.262
But that's not the way
it's going to go.

01:17:34.264 --> 01:17:36.301
Henri, if you
would be so kind.

01:17:38.002 --> 01:17:39.702
- No!
- Oh, Jesus.

01:17:39.704 --> 01:17:42.503
- Holy shit!
- And do pay attention to that man behind the curtain.

01:17:47.478 --> 01:17:48.778
Your Rabbit
wasn't quick enough.

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.180
Maybe next time,
he'll hop a little faster, eh?

01:17:51.182 --> 01:17:52.348
If anything happens to him,

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:54.382
I'm gonna fuck you
six ways to Sunday!

01:17:54.384 --> 01:17:58.086
Jeez Louise. Now I know who
gobbled all my Flova Scotia.

01:17:59.490 --> 01:18:01.823
So, drop your guns,

01:18:01.825 --> 01:18:03.859
or the Rabbit
and his girlfriend

01:18:03.861 --> 01:18:07.796
will multiply
in gruesome fashion.

01:18:07.798 --> 01:18:08.799
I'm so sorry.

01:18:12.303 --> 01:18:14.202
Let her go, Guy. She has
nothing to do with this!

01:18:14.204 --> 01:18:15.904
Well, if they put
their guns down,

01:18:15.906 --> 01:18:17.141
no harm will come to her.

01:18:20.678 --> 01:18:21.679
Go on. Drop them.

01:18:22.813 --> 01:18:24.648
Drop your guns.
Drop it.

01:18:28.419 --> 01:18:30.255
Now get those
hands in the air.

01:18:30.922 --> 01:18:32.123
Like you just don't care.

01:18:34.592 --> 01:18:36.024
So, are you ready...

01:18:39.864 --> 01:18:41.199
for the big twist?

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.676
What the fuck?

01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:55.346
What are you doing? What?

01:18:56.213 --> 01:18:58.046
Shut the front door!

01:18:58.048 --> 01:18:59.350
Genevieve.

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:01.516
What's going on here?

01:19:01.518 --> 01:19:03.252
He'll kill me.
Let me out of my chains.

01:19:03.254 --> 01:19:05.653
What the fuck
took you so long, Guy?

01:19:05.655 --> 01:19:08.256
First I have to have
his circumcised dick in me

01:19:08.258 --> 01:19:10.058
and then you tie me
to this log?

01:19:19.771 --> 01:19:21.202
Are you fucking
kidding me?

01:19:23.973 --> 01:19:25.474
I hate you!

01:19:25.476 --> 01:19:26.574
I hate you.

01:19:26.576 --> 01:19:27.579
Shoot them.

01:19:29.513 --> 01:19:30.645
Shoot them all.

01:19:30.647 --> 01:19:31.815
With pleasure, boss.

01:19:33.017 --> 01:19:34.183
Hold on!

01:19:34.185 --> 01:19:38.086
If I'm going down,
I'm going down American!

Shoot them.

01:20:17.061 --> 01:20:18.730

01:20:23.767 --> 01:20:24.832

01:20:50.727 --> 01:20:51.728
Ah!

01:20:59.468 --> 01:21:01.605
Damn it! I'm out of bullets!

01:21:02.072 --> 01:21:03.338
I got one more!

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:04.542
Make it count!

01:21:11.915 --> 01:21:13.250
Oh!

01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:14.652
Ow.

01:21:19.456 --> 01:21:20.889
Gotta love that 48th bullet.

01:21:20.891 --> 01:21:22.791
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

01:21:22.793 --> 01:21:25.226
Come on,
get up from the dirt.

01:21:25.228 --> 01:21:27.695
I'm about to get neutered!

01:21:27.697 --> 01:21:28.796
Hang on!

01:21:28.798 --> 01:21:30.532
Get this outta here!

01:21:30.534 --> 01:21:32.704
Get me off this!

01:21:34.271 --> 01:21:35.604
I don't think so.

01:21:35.606 --> 01:21:40.009
Okay. Now you've lit the fuse
of the Halifax Explosion.

01:21:40.011 --> 01:21:42.176
Yeah. In my day...

01:21:42.178 --> 01:21:43.778
when your big boy teeth
came in,

01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:46.148
your hockey coach
would pull them out...

01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:47.416
so you wouldn't
miss a shift.

01:21:47.418 --> 01:21:49.484
Yeah? In my country,

01:21:49.486 --> 01:21:51.586
we let the Tooth Fairy
deal with that shit.

01:21:51.588 --> 01:21:54.088
You would know all about
fairies, wouldn't you?

01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:55.290
Okay. Let's do this,
moosefucker.

01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:56.425
Yeah, you want to do it?

01:21:56.427 --> 01:21:57.792
- You wanna go?
- Yeah. Let's go.

01:21:57.794 --> 01:22:00.662
- Yeah. You wanna go? You wanna go?
- Yeah. I wanna go.

01:22:00.664 --> 01:22:03.431
Ooh, clip-on.
Little tacky, eh?

01:22:18.081 --> 01:22:19.314
Yeah!

01:22:19.316 --> 01:22:20.849
That's one former
hockey player

01:22:20.851 --> 01:22:22.050
who can shut the puck up!

01:22:22.052 --> 01:22:23.118
Right, guys?

01:22:24.487 --> 01:22:26.557
Shit, that was a good line.

01:22:29.593 --> 01:22:31.393
Come on, damn it!

01:22:31.395 --> 01:22:32.797
Oh, my God!

01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:47.708
That's great!
That's great!

01:22:47.710 --> 01:22:49.778
What the
hell is wrong with you guys?

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.947
It's like none of you Yanks
ever operated

01:22:51.949 --> 01:22:54.550
an industrial grade
rotary timber saw, eh?

01:22:54.552 --> 01:22:56.217
Hey! What about your accent?

01:22:56.219 --> 01:23:01.021
Andrea Spooner,
Ontario Provincial Police.

01:23:01.023 --> 01:23:02.658
- What?
- Shut up!

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:03.661
What?

01:23:13.736 --> 01:23:16.470
Why is the Vermont
Highway Patrol even here?

01:23:16.472 --> 01:23:18.974
I've been undercover
three years.

01:23:18.976 --> 01:23:20.074
Part of a task force...

01:23:20.076 --> 01:23:21.443
with the
Organized Crime Unit

01:23:21.445 --> 01:23:23.345
of the Ontario
Provincial Police.

01:23:23.347 --> 01:23:24.779
She's down with OPP.

01:23:24.781 --> 01:23:28.750
You assholes just blew
three years of work for me.

01:23:28.752 --> 01:23:30.452
I was this close
to getting their supplier.

01:23:30.454 --> 01:23:31.787
Now I'll never get them.

01:23:31.789 --> 01:23:34.189
Well, I'm happy to offer you
full cooperation of our...

01:23:34.191 --> 01:23:35.593
Shut the fuck up!

01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.226
Hm.

01:23:38.228 --> 01:23:39.627
- Wow.
- Wow.

01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:41.663
Hey, guys,
do me a solid, eh?

01:23:41.665 --> 01:23:42.864
When you're sweeping up
back there,

01:23:42.866 --> 01:23:44.265
keep an eye out
for my falsies.

01:23:44.267 --> 01:23:46.234
Nah. You're not
going to need teeth

01:23:46.236 --> 01:23:47.402
where you're going, eh.

01:23:47.404 --> 01:23:49.203
You were our hero, Guy.

01:23:49.205 --> 01:23:50.939
An hockey player
who owned a whorehouse.

01:23:50.941 --> 01:23:52.573
Yeah, and to think
you spent 11 years

01:23:52.575 --> 01:23:53.908
in the Canadian system.

01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:56.510
Newsy Lalonde would be rolling
in his grave right now.

01:23:56.512 --> 01:23:59.180
You would have fit
in good in Calgary, eh.

01:23:59.182 --> 01:24:00.881
Talk about a bunch of goon.

01:24:00.883 --> 01:24:02.585
Especially
that defenseman Bonchance.

01:24:02.587 --> 01:24:03.952
That guy is the worst.

01:24:03.954 --> 01:24:05.119
What a mucker, that guy, eh?

01:24:05.121 --> 01:24:08.390
No, he end up in the QSPHL
by the time he's 38.

01:24:08.392 --> 01:24:09.994
Boring!

01:24:10.628 --> 01:24:13.464
Easy! Easy!

01:24:13.797 --> 01:24:15.064
Ah! Oh!

01:24:15.066 --> 01:24:16.631
There he is!

01:24:16.633 --> 01:24:18.466
They wrapped you
in the Japanese flag.

01:24:20.469 --> 01:24:22.537
Hey, man,
thanks for saving my life.

01:24:22.539 --> 01:24:24.805
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

01:24:24.807 --> 01:24:27.074
Oh, that's okay,
I don't need a hug.

01:24:27.076 --> 01:24:28.512
It's not for you.

01:24:31.214 --> 01:24:32.417
Okay.

01:24:33.616 --> 01:24:36.454
Careful, careful, careful!

01:24:41.157 --> 01:24:43.024
Dude, are you lactating?

01:24:43.026 --> 01:24:46.894
I'm just doing what my body
tells me to do, okay?

01:24:46.896 --> 01:24:49.331
Okay, Thorn.
You're the tits!

01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:50.899
Good luck with
the wet T-shirt contest.

01:25:06.917 --> 01:25:08.052
Men.

01:25:10.521 --> 01:25:11.854
How are ya feelin'?

01:25:11.856 --> 01:25:13.521
Oh, it's okay.

01:25:13.523 --> 01:25:15.991
I'm so sorry about saying
"I hate you" back there.

01:25:15.993 --> 01:25:18.359
Yeah. I know.
I'm sorry I lied.

01:25:18.361 --> 01:25:19.760
I just can't believe
I didn't know.

01:25:19.762 --> 01:25:22.667
Well, you were very sweet,
but also very gullible.

01:25:28.539 --> 01:25:30.405
Maybe you and I
could get together

01:25:30.407 --> 01:25:33.242
and listen to some
old-timey French music...

01:25:33.244 --> 01:25:35.310
when that gets
all healed up.

01:25:35.312 --> 01:25:36.547
Yeah, sure.

01:25:40.249 --> 01:25:41.886
Fuckin' Canadian.

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:48.422
- Give me 50 cc's of morphine, shaving cream and a razor.
- A razor for what?

01:25:48.424 --> 01:25:49.992
To remove the hair
from your testicles.

01:25:49.994 --> 01:25:51.059
I have to stitch you up.

01:25:51.061 --> 01:25:52.726
Why would
you need to stitch me up?

01:25:52.728 --> 01:25:53.996
It's like a paper cut.

01:25:53.998 --> 01:25:55.997
All we need to do is get
a little Band-Aid. Hey, guys!

01:25:55.999 --> 01:25:57.131
Happy trails!

01:25:57.133 --> 01:26:00.101
Looks like the rook's getting
his nuts shaved after all.

01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:08.443
- Who wants coffee?
- Sounds good.

01:26:15.185 --> 01:26:16.620
Captain O'Hagan!

01:26:17.922 --> 01:26:20.922
I hear you and your men
did some good work.

01:26:20.924 --> 01:26:23.759
We did.
We caught the smugglers.

01:26:23.761 --> 01:26:24.826
Again.

01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:29.331
What the hell was that?

01:26:29.333 --> 01:26:31.466
Oh, shit.

01:26:34.404 --> 01:26:37.738
Done and done.

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:40.908
This little piggy cried,
"God damn! That hurt!"

01:26:41.777 --> 01:26:43.479
What the hell happened to you?

01:26:43.481 --> 01:26:45.447
Ah. I just lost a pussy bet.

01:26:45.449 --> 01:26:47.114
If I "toed" ya,
I'd have to kill ya.

01:26:47.116 --> 01:26:48.350
Oh!

01:26:48.352 --> 01:26:50.018
Watch the hoof! Ow!
Watch the hoof!

01:26:51.355 --> 01:26:54.622
Officers! Cassandra Anne
Gacek, Action Five News.

01:26:54.624 --> 01:26:56.524
Given your involvement
with this bust

01:26:56.526 --> 01:26:57.792
how does it feel to know

01:26:57.794 --> 01:26:59.563
that you are still
being replaced?

01:27:00.896 --> 01:27:05.734
Uh, you know, when they first
arrive I am wondering:

01:27:05.736 --> 01:27:07.268
"Who are these people

01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:09.470
they come here
taked our land?"

01:27:09.472 --> 01:27:12.176
But then I have it,
my answer, huh.

01:27:14.945 --> 01:27:17.412
They are heroes.

01:27:17.414 --> 01:27:18.813
Aw!

01:27:18.815 --> 01:27:23.118
These men... they putted their
life on the line for us.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.689
One of them,
he even saved my life.

01:27:26.691 --> 01:27:30.192
This tan guy here
with the wet tits.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.128
- But we hate Americans!
- I hear you. I hear you.

01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:35.497
But I have to tell you...

01:27:35.499 --> 01:27:37.466
if these gentlemen
are an example

01:27:37.468 --> 01:27:39.967
of what it means
to be American...

01:27:39.969 --> 01:27:40.902
I'm okay.

01:27:40.904 --> 01:27:43.137
Then I am proud to be
an American too.

01:27:43.139 --> 01:27:46.207
- All right.
- I am. I'm proud to be American.

01:27:46.209 --> 01:27:48.577
So, we're leaving
to start our station up north.

01:27:48.579 --> 01:27:49.810
But I say
with great confidence

01:27:49.812 --> 01:27:51.046
that we couldn't leave you
in better hands

01:27:51.048 --> 01:27:54.616
than in those
of the Vermont Highway Patrol.

01:27:59.356 --> 01:28:02.358
How does it feel to be the coolest
motherfucker on this planet?

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.260
You tell me, buddy.
You tell me.

01:28:05.262 --> 01:28:08.596
Aw.

01:28:08.598 --> 01:28:10.900
Uh, yeah. Excuse me.

01:28:11.235 --> 01:28:12.268
Hold on.

01:28:13.570 --> 01:28:15.737
Actually,
I'm here to tell you

01:28:15.739 --> 01:28:17.840
that the U.S.
and Canadian governments

01:28:17.842 --> 01:28:20.074
have decided to postpone
the turnover

01:28:20.076 --> 01:28:23.110
until the rest of the
hidden contraband is found.

01:28:23.112 --> 01:28:25.546
So, wait.

01:28:25.548 --> 01:28:28.082
Are we Canadians
or are we Americans?

01:28:28.084 --> 01:28:30.717
You're still Canadians
for now.

01:28:30.719 --> 01:28:33.988
And that's going
to continue indefinitely.

01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:35.192
Sorry.

01:28:39.262 --> 01:28:42.898
Okay, so we are now in control
of this area again, eh?

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.067
No, no.
We both have authority.

01:28:45.069 --> 01:28:46.635
You got the authority
to go take

01:28:46.637 --> 01:28:48.069
a flying fuck
at a rolling doughnut.

01:28:48.071 --> 01:28:50.104
Hey, we just saved your lives,
you remember that?

01:28:50.106 --> 01:28:51.738
We have an expression here.

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:53.908
It go, "What have you done
for me lately?"

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:55.344
Yeah, maybe
we'll haul your ass

01:28:55.346 --> 01:28:56.510
back out to the woods naked.

01:28:56.512 --> 01:28:59.546
Or maybe we could burn down
your White House again! Eh?

01:28:59.548 --> 01:29:00.881
What the hell does that mean?

01:29:00.883 --> 01:29:03.652
The War of 1812, eh.
Learn your history.

01:29:07.124 --> 01:29:09.957
Oh! You punched the mustache
right off his face!

01:29:09.959 --> 01:29:12.661
No, no, no! Look,
he's wearing a postiche, eh!

01:29:14.798 --> 01:29:16.631

postiche, come on!

Cat in a tree.

01:29:49.766 --> 01:29:52.268
Ah, yeah.

01:29:52.902 --> 01:29:54.002
Hey, Fred Savage.

01:29:54.004 --> 01:29:55.737
- How's it going?
- Macintyre Womack.

01:29:55.739 --> 01:29:57.139
Oh, pleasure to meet you,
Officer.

01:29:57.141 --> 01:29:57.904
Carl Foster.

01:29:57.906 --> 01:29:59.407
Nice to meet you. Fred.

01:29:59.409 --> 01:30:01.076
So, what's with the ride-along?
You got a cop movie coming out?

01:30:01.078 --> 01:30:03.243
Uh, no, it's actually a new
show for the Syfy Channel.

01:30:03.245 --> 01:30:06.782
Kind of a small-town alien
invasion show called <i>Vermonsters.</i>

01:30:06.784 --> 01:30:08.315
- Oh!
- I'd see that.

01:30:08.317 --> 01:30:09.751
So, do you guys spend
a lot of time

01:30:09.753 --> 01:30:11.385
getting, um,
cats out of trees?

01:30:11.387 --> 01:30:13.253
Is that kinda the job?

01:30:13.255 --> 01:30:15.155
No, we get the call and then
we call the Fire Department.

01:30:15.157 --> 01:30:16.859
- They get the damn thing out.
- Oh.

01:30:16.861 --> 01:30:19.493
Could I actually trouble you
for a quick selfie?

01:30:19.495 --> 01:30:21.895
I'm a big <i>Princess Bride</i> fan.

01:30:21.897 --> 01:30:23.030
Yes. My pleasure.

01:30:23.032 --> 01:30:24.599
That was my "get laid movie"
in high school.

01:30:24.601 --> 01:30:26.134
Oh! You're welcome.

01:30:26.136 --> 01:30:27.668
Buttercup!

01:30:27.670 --> 01:30:28.737
Holy shit!

01:30:28.739 --> 01:30:29.636
- Did you get it?
- Nailed it.

01:30:29.638 --> 01:30:31.206
Fred fuckin' Savage, huh?

01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:33.073
- Uh, yes. That's me.
- He's right here! Look at him!

01:30:33.075 --> 01:30:34.576
- Yeah, we know.
- How are ya?

01:30:34.578 --> 01:30:35.877
You still with Winnie?

01:30:35.879 --> 01:30:37.979
Uh, no, no. Just a...
just a show, man.

01:30:37.981 --> 01:30:40.114
- I call sloppy seconds!
- Okay, great.

01:30:40.116 --> 01:30:41.983
I think I'm gonna get the cat.
I'm gonna get the cat.

01:30:41.985 --> 01:30:43.350
Mr. Savage,
we can't let you do that,

01:30:43.352 --> 01:30:44.252
because, you know, well,

01:30:44.254 --> 01:30:45.487
we're responsible
for your safety.

01:30:45.489 --> 01:30:47.055
Don't worry about it.
I'm an expert climber.

01:30:47.057 --> 01:30:48.823
Remember the movie
<i>Super Monkey?</i>

01:30:48.825 --> 01:30:50.192
Yeah.

01:30:50.194 --> 01:30:51.492
I did all my own stunts
in that movie.

01:30:51.494 --> 01:30:52.592
I'm good with the trees.

01:30:52.594 --> 01:30:53.694
Okay.

01:30:54.798 --> 01:30:57.364
Look at him go. Wow.

01:30:57.366 --> 01:30:59.934
I can see it!
I got the cat.

01:30:59.936 --> 01:31:01.536
Take it easy, Mr. Savage.

01:31:01.538 --> 01:31:03.238
I thought <i>Super Monkey</i> sucked.

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.105
Yeah. And the monkeys
were so fuckin' fake.

01:31:05.107 --> 01:31:07.274
- A.O. Scott said the plot was bananas.
- Hey, buddy.

01:31:07.276 --> 01:31:08.976
Hey, you know,
I can hear you guys.

01:31:08.978 --> 01:31:10.411
Alright, you should try
acting in a movie

01:31:10.413 --> 01:31:12.412
and doing your own stunts.
It's really hard!

01:31:12.414 --> 01:31:14.649
- Sure.
- All right, don't be dicks.

01:31:21.659 --> 01:31:22.890
Woo!

01:31:24.494 --> 01:31:25.693
Did you see that shit?!

01:31:26.762 --> 01:31:28.729

want some pussy?

01:31:28.731 --> 01:31:30.498

I can't believe it's a crime
down in the U.S.

01:34:30.146 --> 01:34:32.313
to drink beer
and enjoy tits and dick.

01:34:32.315 --> 01:34:35.483
I mean, beep beep!
There's no harm there.

01:34:35.485 --> 01:34:37.752

There's no harm there.

It's a good workout, eh.

01:34:42.258 --> 01:34:43.858
Cut. I could do that
all night.

01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:45.827
I know...

01:34:45.829 --> 01:34:47.894
And action!

01:34:47.896 --> 01:34:49.663
Oh!

01:34:49.665 --> 01:34:52.000
That's how easy it is.

01:34:52.002 --> 01:34:53.667
Oh! Jesus Christ.
Motherfucker.

01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:56.738
What do we got, till lunch?
We got till lunch?

01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:57.805
Action.

01:34:57.807 --> 01:34:59.041
Oh!

01:34:59.043 --> 01:35:02.443
Which one of you guys
has a, le, a le seniority?

01:35:08.250 --> 01:35:10.385
You got to blow
those cheeks out.

01:35:10.387 --> 01:35:11.452
Okay.

01:35:11.454 --> 01:35:15.088
I think I have some of your
mustache in my mouth.

01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:16.658
Where's your asshole?

01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:19.327
It's right about...
right there.

01:35:19.329 --> 01:35:20.761
Just follow the heat.

01:35:20.763 --> 01:35:23.998
First you steal our job
and now you sit here

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.733
getting a sensual massage
from a chair

01:35:25.735 --> 01:35:29.569
in the center of the mall
with our women.

01:35:29.571 --> 01:35:32.306
Can you shorten that?

01:35:32.308 --> 01:35:34.108
No, that's the only way
I can say it.

01:35:34.110 --> 01:35:36.711
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jeez Louise.

01:35:36.713 --> 01:35:39.146
Now I know who gobbled up
all my Lava Scotia.

01:35:39.148 --> 01:35:40.314
Uh, Flova Scotia.

01:35:40.316 --> 01:35:42.750
Now I know who gobbled up
all my Flava Scotia.

01:35:42.752 --> 01:35:44.853
- Uh, Flo, uh, Flova.
- Flova. God damn it.

01:35:44.855 --> 01:35:46.054
All my Flava Scotia.

01:35:46.056 --> 01:35:48.223
- All my Flava Scotia.
- Flova.

01:35:48.225 --> 01:35:50.091
I'm gonna get it. Nova. Flova.

01:35:50.093 --> 01:35:53.060
Now I know who gobbled up
all my Flava Scotia.

01:35:53.062 --> 01:35:55.029
- Close?
- No. Not really.

01:35:57.232 --> 01:35:59.434
What about this?!
What about this, huh?!

01:35:59.436 --> 01:36:01.034
Didn't we
do that to like

01:36:01.036 --> 01:36:02.836
a skinny blond guy
with a big forehead?

01:36:02.838 --> 01:36:03.938
Smelled like bacon?

01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:05.573
Always yakking about
Hot Pockets?

01:36:05.575 --> 01:36:06.774
That was me.

01:36:06.776 --> 01:36:08.909
You asked if I saw you

01:36:08.911 --> 01:36:11.311
jumping around
all mimbly bimbly...

01:36:11.313 --> 01:36:12.913
You asked if I saw you

01:36:12.915 --> 01:36:15.750
jumping around
all nimby, ni...

01:36:15.752 --> 01:36:17.618
All nibbily-bimbly.

01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.487
Sorry, what...
It's nimbly-bimbly.

01:36:19.489 --> 01:36:21.456
Come on, Gaffigan!
