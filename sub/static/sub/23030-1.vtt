02:41.368 --> 02:44.620
So, have you made a decision
as yet?

02:44.622 --> 02:46.079
Yeah, I'm going.

02:46.081 --> 02:48.249
That's great honey,
you deserve a break.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.417
Just make sure that you're home
in time

02:50.419 --> 02:52.586
to help out with Dad tonight,
okay?

02:52.588 --> 02:53.423
Yeah.

02:56.258 --> 02:58.133
If it's anybody
that can get your father

02:58.135 --> 03:00.555
to eat these things, it's you.

03:03.724 --> 03:04.891
Love ya, gotta go.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.144
Have fun, bye.

03:10.689 --> 03:13.317
Just gone for the day, Monkey.

03:16.320 --> 03:20.115
Just make sure Dad
takes these on the hour.

03:20.991 --> 03:23.910
Dr. Singh's number's
by the phone.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.745
And just take Dad outside and
make him get some fresh air...

03:25.747 --> 03:28.955
Yeah, don't worry, I got it.

03:28.957 --> 03:30.375
You gonna be okay?

03:30.377 --> 03:31.417
Mm-hm.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.420
- Sure?
- Yeah.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.679
It's taken me a long
time to come to terms

03:42.681 --> 03:45.263
with my father's cancer.

03:45.265 --> 03:48.434
But since my father's
diagnosis, everything,

03:48.436 --> 03:50.772
everyone, seems so distant.

03:52.356 --> 03:55.149
I hardly even write anymore.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.817
The things I had once collected
for vanity

03:56.819 --> 03:58.945
quickly lost their appeal,

03:58.947 --> 04:01.947
and now, the only things
that still have value

04:01.949 --> 04:04.702
are those that make me
feel safe.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.870
At least I have that.

04:07.872 --> 04:10.330
Some people have nothing at all.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.704
Top of the news.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.581
Police are urging citizens
to be vigilant

05:33.583 --> 05:35.457
as crime continues
to be of grave...

05:35.459 --> 05:36.584
Have you not...

05:49.139 --> 05:52.433
Did you do
your college applications yet?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.935
I can't go,
so what's the point?

05:54.937 --> 05:55.771
Hm.

05:59.024 --> 06:01.483
There's one school I could
apply to for a scholarship,

06:01.485 --> 06:04.238
but it's really hard
to get into.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.158
Yeah.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.659
And what are these?

06:10.661 --> 06:13.413
They're organic.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.998
From outside.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.541
Hm.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.836
Well, you are my daughter,
so anything is possible.

06:19.838 --> 06:20.672
Yeah.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.464
You gonna work
on the truck today?

06:24.466 --> 06:26.675
You gonna do
the applications tonight?

06:32.766 --> 06:34.933
Might be good for you
to get outside.

06:34.935 --> 06:37.519
You know, get some fresh air.

06:37.521 --> 06:38.313
Joanna!

06:39.524 --> 06:42.065
What are you doing?
Let's go, woman!

06:42.067 --> 06:43.026
Hi, Beth.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.235
Hi, Mr. Soloman.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.235
How are you?

06:45.237 --> 06:46.236
I'm good.

06:46.238 --> 06:47.740
- Mm-hm?
- I'm good.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.284
Yeah,
so I'm gonna wait outside.

06:52.286 --> 06:53.120
Hurry up.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.583
Right.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.539
I'll see you later.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.541
Be good.

06:59.543 --> 07:00.543
- Yeah, you too.
- Bye.

07:00.545 --> 07:14.516
Bye.

07:14.516 --> 07:15.683
So I have my girl
for the whole weekend?

07:15.685 --> 07:16.683
I can't.

07:16.685 --> 07:18.270
You can't? Why?

07:19.230 --> 07:21.313
Look, I'm trying.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.399
I have to be back home tonight.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.235
Alright.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.236
Your book.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.572
How much writing
you think you're actually

07:29.574 --> 07:30.615

this weekend, huh?

07:30.617 --> 07:31.740
Go!

07:31.742 --> 07:32.533
Alright, come on,
we waiting on you.

07:35.497 --> 07:36.495
It's actually
a nice song though.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.622
Thank you!

07:38.833 --> 07:40.248
Why must we listen
to this club music?

07:40.250 --> 07:41.334
We going to the beach.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.170
You're not even headbanging
in time!

07:44.172 --> 07:46.341
Go outside, go outside.

07:49.593 --> 07:50.885
- Joanna's here.
- Finally.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.178
Good to see you, bro!

07:52.180 --> 07:55.014
Took forever, you mighta
bring your whole family coming.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.704
Good day.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.206

08:20.208 --> 08:23.336
I told you all,

08:28.550 --> 08:31.927

You working all day?

08:41.354 --> 08:44.399
Yeah, I am.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.648
I could talk to your
boss for yuh, yuh know.

08:46.650 --> 08:50.237
That's okay,
you don't need to do that.

08:59.538 --> 09:00.787
It's fine.

09:00.789 --> 09:02.833
It's fine, just take it.

09:10.799 --> 09:14.051

09:36.743 --> 09:38.450
The bossman say yuh have

09:38.452 --> 09:41.661

09:41.663 --> 09:43.415
Alright, alright.

09:55.552 --> 09:56.886
I'm always busy.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.429
I'm always busy because...

09:58.431 --> 09:59.972
This is Luke to home base.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.266
We're coming in hot,
clear the runway.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.392
- Clear the runway!
- Hey!

10:03.394 --> 10:04.518
- Hey!
- Stop!

10:04.520 --> 10:05.811
It's not funny.
It's not funny.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.229
It's a little funny.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.647
Alright alright alright
alright, we wasting time.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.648
We need to go up the road.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.712
A cherished distraction.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.006
A break from feeling alone.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.215
Perhaps I need to catch myself?

10:35.217 --> 10:38.552
Perhaps I should let myself go.

10:38.554 --> 10:41.638
A refreshing reminder
of who's in control.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.307
Our will is but a suggestion.

10:44.309 --> 10:47.479
We are powerless
to the ebb and flow.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.400
No no no no!

10:53.445 --> 10:54.609
- You want a drink?
- Put me down!

10:59.408 --> 11:00.199
So?

11:00.201 --> 11:01.283
You want a drink?

11:01.285 --> 11:03.869
No, come on, let's go.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.412
Maybe in a little bit.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.583
I'm gonna stay, lime with
the boys and take a drink.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.795
You're not gonna want to
go surfing later, you know.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.171
I'll come in a bit.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.797
I'm gonna stay, we now reach.

11:15.799 --> 11:17.257
Whole ocean to yourself.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.093
Alright.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.844
Bye!

11:20.846 --> 11:27.102

11:33.567 --> 11:34.650
Oh, my boy.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.693
You can't even
drink a beer properly.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.694
That's what you
should be drinking there.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.695
Yeah?

11:37.697 --> 11:38.695
Yeah.

11:38.697 --> 11:39.696
Such a alcoholic.

11:39.698 --> 11:40.531
Don't feel like you
getting away.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.949

11:41.951 --> 11:43.533
I doh have nothing to 'fraid,
I have nothing to prove.

11:43.535 --> 11:44.535

12:35.504 --> 12:36.963
Boy come out from here,
nah boy!

12:57.443 --> 12:59.694
A rip current
is a channel of water

12:59.696 --> 13:02.780
that rapidly pulls you
outward from the shore.

13:02.782 --> 13:06.825
There's no chance of fighting
it, it's too powerful.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.703
Although it's counterintuitive,

13:08.705 --> 13:12.623
if you ever find yourself
in one, simply surrender.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.626
Swim along the shore until
you have escaped its grasp.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.921
Once free,
you can swim safely to land.

13:50.038 --> 13:50.869
Finally!

13:50.871 --> 13:53.665
I thought you were
gonna grow scales!

13:53.667 --> 13:54.956
You were in there for so long!

13:54.958 --> 13:57.209
Yeah, I haven't been surfing
in forever.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.877
Yeah, I know.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.879
But it's so good
to see you, though.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.547
We never get to lime anymore.

14:02.549 --> 14:04.175
You know, with Dad.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.509
Yeah.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.511
Well, it's good you're
getting a break, you know?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.095
Even if it's just for a day.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.724
Yeah.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.849
Look who it is.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.602
Better lock up your man.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.647
Look at her, headed
straight for the fellas.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.108
If you feel I leaving her
alone with Mark, yuh lie.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.360
Come lewwe go.

14:28.283 --> 14:29.119
Hey.

14:29.910 --> 14:30.993
Want a beer?

14:30.995 --> 14:32.246
Yes, please.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.123
How's the water?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.081
- It's good.
- Yeah?

14:36.083 --> 14:38.002
It's good to be back.

14:39.962 --> 14:43.422
So I guess I'll see you
again in a couple weeks?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.467
You're leaving now, huh?

14:46.302 --> 14:49.139
Why don't you
come by and visit?

14:51.349 --> 14:54.224
Dad's been asking about you.

14:54.226 --> 14:59.149
I know, I just...

14:59.149 --> 15:01.148
I can't see him like that.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.609
I know that's...

15:03.945 --> 15:05.527
I'm sorry.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.530
That's OK.

15:12.327 --> 15:16.124
I'm just gonna...

15:16.124 --> 15:17.373
Is there an opener anywhere?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.376
Ty, you have to show
me how you did that.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.794
How, open the bottle?

15:21.796 --> 15:22.920
Yeah.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.088
It's easy.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.964
You just wanna get
under the cap like that,

15:25.966 --> 15:26.757
and it just pop up.

15:26.759 --> 15:27.925
Alright, can I try?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.509
- Sure.
- Alright, cool.

15:29.511 --> 15:52.159
Maybe you can open it for me.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.325
Hey.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.329
Last ride into town,
you coming or what?

15:56.331 --> 15:58.957
Cap like this, and you just...

16:02.003 --> 16:04.045
Nah, I think I'm gonna stay.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.255
Alright, cool.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.419
Your rabbit food
in the fridge.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.837
Look on the top shelf.

16:45.839 --> 16:46.628
Thank you.

16:46.630 --> 16:47.421
Mm-hmm.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.631
It have any more beers?

16:48.633 --> 16:50.757
Yeah, somewhere in there.

16:50.759 --> 16:57.933
Just look hard.

16:57.933 --> 17:00.184
Honestly, Jo,
don't even take it on.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.855
She's clearly drunk.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.354
Or just stupid.

17:27.630 --> 17:28.503
Hello?

17:28.506 --> 17:30.256
Dad, hey, I'm in...

17:30.258 --> 17:31.466
Hello?

17:31.468 --> 17:32.467
Hello?

17:32.469 --> 17:33.926
Hello? Honey?

17:33.928 --> 17:35.053
- Hello?
- Hello?

17:37.766 --> 17:38.765
She's on her way?

17:38.767 --> 17:39.766
The reception was pretty bad,

17:39.768 --> 17:41.683
so I'm guessing
she was still in the bush.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.143
Hmm.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.104
Well, she's with Tyler,
so she should be fine.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.734
It have a reason why
policemen does use guns

18:31.736 --> 18:33.402
and not cutlasses.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.321
You ever see a man take
chop from a cutlass, pardner?

18:35.323 --> 18:36.948
You ever see a man get shoot?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.283
The kinda training,
precision, breathing...

18:39.285 --> 18:40.575
You seeing this blade, padna?

18:40.577 --> 18:41.786
You seeing this blade?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.161
When you hit a man so, wap!

18:43.163 --> 18:45.163
And you pull him out so, check.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.124
- Wah!
- Wha you doing, boy?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.584
Fighting the ghost back.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.128
Yo, that's bad luck; just
put down my blade please.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.631
Bad luck for you!

18:56.553 --> 18:57.971
But yeah, man.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.055
I still find cutlass
is the best thing...

19:01.057 --> 19:02.390
What are you all doing?

19:02.392 --> 19:03.391
Telling ghost stories.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.937
Yeah, like the video, right?

19:07.939 --> 19:09.896
The man is a ex-Marine
or something like that.

19:09.898 --> 19:15.320
So he's taking the gun and
he's showing you how to do...

19:15.320 --> 19:16.863
You alright?

19:16.865 --> 19:17.781
Me? Yeah.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.491
Why?

19:21.368 --> 19:22.453
You're drunk.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.663
Mm-hmm.

19:26.624 --> 19:32.212
And avoiding me.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.963

19:34.965 --> 19:37.382

19:37.384 --> 19:43.432
Just relax.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.308

19:46.102 --> 19:48.229
Like Kelly.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.687
So that's my fault now, huh?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.021
That she came and sat on my lap?

19:54.402 --> 19:56.738
I'm just wasting my time.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.114

20:01.116 --> 20:02.824

20:19.885 --> 20:22.471

20:22.471 --> 20:24.305

20:24.307 --> 20:26.474
You're my girl.

20:26.476 --> 20:27.683

20:27.685 --> 20:31.520
You have nothing and
nobody to worry about.

20:31.522 --> 20:32.356
Alright?

20:35.442 --> 20:37.276
Why do you have to be
such a jerk?

37:44.389 --> 37:47.347
You're a grown-ass man.

37:47.349 --> 37:49.641

37:56.735 --> 37:58.860
Well then shouldn't you be

37:58.862 --> 38:00.445
Well, we're doing

38:02.949 --> 38:06.075
I have 50 men on the ground,
and if indeed she is in Toco,

38:06.077 --> 38:08.119
we will find her.

38:08.121 --> 38:08.994

I can assure you that the
police is quite equipped

38:20.382 --> 38:21.590

I know these people,
I know how they think.

38:29.684 --> 38:32.769
This situation is too dangerous.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.311
- Sir.
- Hello.

38:34.313 --> 38:35.188
There's been a landslide.

38:35.190 --> 38:37.440
No access in our out.

38:41.195 --> 38:46.074
You'll just have me excused,
everybody just stay put.

38:46.076 --> 38:47.532
Tyler, pack.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.367

41:03.463 --> 41:08.383

that we've covered already.

41:08.385 --> 41:10.550
The main road
is no longer accessible.

41:10.552 --> 41:13.347
No.

41:13.347 --> 41:15.766
We need to get our men here.

41:17.686 --> 41:18.559
Yeah.

41:18.561 --> 41:19.559
May I?

41:19.561 --> 41:20.563
Please, yes.

41:24.733 --> 41:27.275
I used to hike this
area before I got sick.

41:27.277 --> 41:29.612
We take half the amount of time
if we use the running trail

41:29.614 --> 41:32.615
that cuts through this hill.

41:32.617 --> 41:35.534
If we can then get your
men up on this plateau,

41:35.536 --> 41:36.952
you'd be able to see
all of Toco;

41:36.954 --> 41:38.412
it has the best vantage point

41:38.414 --> 41:40.748
and it isn't hard
to get down from.

41:40.750 --> 41:43.585
I have another map
I can show you.

41:44.545 --> 41:47.213
I will get back your daughter.

41:47.215 --> 41:48.550
One of us will.

41:52.052 --> 41:54.679
Come over in here
and then it's here,

41:54.681 --> 41:56.680
and then down in here and
then this is the trail.

41:56.682 --> 41:57.807
Yeah.

41:57.809 --> 42:00.142
There's a trail right
here that we can drive on.

42:00.144 --> 42:00.934
OK.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.603
You got it, sir.

42:02.605 --> 42:05.731
Everything you need
is in here.

42:05.733 --> 42:07.358
Please be careful.

42:07.360 --> 42:10.737
Call my cell
if you hear anything.

42:51.820 --> 42:56.701
Alright, you could rest here.

43:07.211 --> 43:09.463
So which one was your man?

43:11.840 --> 43:15.717

43:25.146 --> 43:27.649
A real man woulda do something.

How would you know?

43:38.909 --> 43:40.994

43:56.802 --> 43:58.012
I doh blame yuh.

43:59.431 --> 44:01.889
I have a woman, you know.

44:01.891 --> 44:04.476
She does work in the village.

44:05.311 --> 44:08.731
Sweet too bad!

44:10.733 --> 44:12.233

Alright.

44:26.373 --> 44:28.206
Walk and eat.

44:52.067 --> 44:55.776
Here I am, miles and
miles deep into the hills,

44:55.778 --> 44:59.905
and I find myself walking
closer and closer to this man.

45:02.744 --> 45:04.786
That's enough.

45:17.884 --> 45:21.552
He's the only hope I have
for finding my way out.

45:21.554 --> 45:26.224
At first, I hoped we would
encounter someone, anyone.

45:26.226 --> 45:28.351
But now I'm not so sure.

45:28.353 --> 45:32.438
Anyone we run into this far in
isn't here for a good reason.

46:47.891 --> 46:49.809
Take dem clothes off.

47:01.737 --> 47:02.737

47:02.739 --> 47:04.947
How you freezing so?

47:04.949 --> 47:06.324

47:06.326 --> 47:07.992
You will get sick.

47:07.994 --> 47:09.662

47:33.853 --> 47:36.688
And they laugh, you know.

47:55.375 --> 47:59.003

48:00.797 --> 48:02.838
And I say, "I doh want to."

48:02.840 --> 48:07.971

48:53.016 --> 48:55.182
You should take

48:55.184 --> 49:00.273

49:00.273 --> 49:01.106

52:06.166 --> 52:08.502

But where you think you going?

53:38.802 --> 53:40.178

53:46.434 --> 53:49.226
Nobody ever tell yuh

53:49.228 --> 53:50.561

53:50.563 --> 53:52.854
Yuh doh interfere

53:52.856 --> 53:55.650

55:33.416 --> 55:34.250
Woman!

55:35.710 --> 55:36.836
I'm coming.

55:44.885 --> 55:45.804
Hurry up!

56:01.152 --> 56:04.528
Can we just call my family
and let them know I'm alive?

56:04.530 --> 56:06.905
Since when you running
this show, eh?

56:06.907 --> 56:07.907
Eh?

56:07.909 --> 56:09.117
I will call them when I ready.

56:09.119 --> 56:15.625
No one even knows what's
going on, and my dad is...

56:15.625 --> 56:16.458

56:19.128 --> 56:24.967

56:32.891 --> 56:33.849
Don't you?

56:33.851 --> 56:35.476
What?

56:35.478 --> 56:37.061
Feel guilty?

56:37.063 --> 56:38.396
For what?

56:38.398 --> 56:39.315
Anything?

56:40.483 --> 56:41.443
Everything?

56:53.663 --> 56:54.496
Hm.

56:56.541 --> 57:00.376
The slow conversation from
wrongness to rightness

57:00.378 --> 57:03.338
is a personal process
one goes through

57:03.340 --> 57:05.673
when the mind processes
things of the past,

57:05.675 --> 57:10.635
which have made us the
people who we are today.

57:10.637 --> 57:12.264
Justice for oneself.

57:13.391 --> 57:14.351
Bullshit.

57:15.434 --> 57:16.434
Hey.

57:16.436 --> 57:17.644
Watch your tone.

57:45.840 --> 57:46.758
Fine, fine.

57:47.967 --> 57:49.133
I'll let you talk to them.

57:49.135 --> 57:50.300
When?

57:50.302 --> 57:54.139
When I ready.

57:54.139 --> 57:56.432
But we have to go out there.

58:10.657 --> 58:12.532
On the left-hand side,
there's a road.

58:12.534 --> 58:16.869
We go take that road
and go up to the dam.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.876
It's not too far again.

58:40.769 --> 58:41.853
What time is it?

58:41.855 --> 58:45.817
About 10 minutes since
the last time you ask.

58:48.945 --> 58:50.697
Good time, good time.

58:51.739 --> 58:52.905
OK. Let's go.

58:57.286 --> 58:58.120
What?

59:01.916 --> 59:02.751
Here.

59:03.835 --> 59:04.961
Put these on.

59:09.715 --> 59:10.965
Alright.

59:10.967 --> 59:14.510
When yuh call,
ask to talk to yuh fadda.

59:14.512 --> 59:17.095
Tell him yuh want
to come home now.

59:17.097 --> 59:20.641
If he ask yuh where yuh is,
tell him yuh don't know.

59:20.643 --> 59:22.517
Tell him, for you to come home,

59:22.519 --> 59:25.563
the kidnappers want $500,000.

59:25.565 --> 59:26.398
What?

59:27.608 --> 59:31.610
Once we get there,
I'll dial and you'll talk.

59:31.612 --> 59:33.820
I want a million.

59:33.822 --> 59:34.947
You just said
you wanted 500,000...

59:34.949 --> 59:36.115
Wha, you don't think you
worth a million dollars?

59:36.117 --> 59:37.492
No, but you...

59:37.494 --> 59:38.950
You doh think your family
will pay that for you?

59:38.952 --> 59:41.706
We don't have
that kinda money.

59:49.213 --> 59:52.717
$500,000, girl.

59:52.717 --> 01:00:04.228
Let's go.

01:00:26.376 --> 01:00:28.458
I can't walk
in these shoes anymore.

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.876
They're too heavy.

01:00:29.878 --> 01:00:39.806
Well we here anyway.

01:00:39.806 --> 01:00:40.679
Alright.

01:00:40.681 --> 01:00:42.055
- You know what to do.
- Yes.

01:00:51.985 --> 01:00:53.860
Go on, answer it.

01:00:53.862 --> 01:00:55.530
Hello?

01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:56.364
Hello?

01:01:00.784 --> 01:01:02.786
Fuckin' piece ah shit!

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.334
Try again.

01:01:12.713 --> 01:01:13.757
Answer it.

01:01:16.925 --> 01:01:17.883
Hello?

01:01:17.885 --> 01:01:18.760
Hello?

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:19.802
Joanna?

01:01:19.804 --> 01:01:20.887
No police,
it's just you and Dad.

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:23.097
Your dad is out there looking
for you, it's just me here.

01:01:23.099 --> 01:01:23.889
What?

01:01:23.891 --> 01:01:26.224
How, what's he doing
in the bush?

01:01:26.226 --> 01:01:27.769
It's 500,000.

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:29.186
They want US and TT dollars.

01:01:29.188 --> 01:01:30.563
No police, just you and Daddy.

01:01:30.565 --> 01:01:32.731
Mom, listen, listen.

01:01:32.733 --> 01:01:34.816
Wait for the call,
six p.m. sharp tomorrow.

01:01:34.818 --> 01:01:36.943
And if anything happen
to me in the exchange,

01:01:36.945 --> 01:01:39.155
the kidnappers will know
and they will kill you.

01:01:39.157 --> 01:01:40.697
And don't let anything
happen to the kidnappers

01:01:40.699 --> 01:01:44.746
or they'll know,
and they'll kill me.

01:01:44.746 --> 01:01:46.787
When this happens,
where will you be?

01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:48.246
Where will we find you?

01:01:48.248 --> 01:01:49.750
Just get me home!

01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:52.043
No games, Mom.

01:01:52.045 --> 01:01:53.043
The person collecting the money

01:01:53.045 --> 01:01:54.461
is not gonna know where I am.

01:01:54.463 --> 01:01:55.838
And the kidnapper,
he'll know, and he'll,

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.717
they'll, they'll kill me.

01:02:05.432 --> 01:02:09.769
Joanna!

01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:10.894
A smart girl.

01:02:10.896 --> 01:02:12.479
We don't have that
kind of money.

01:02:12.481 --> 01:02:15.483
You don't worry about
that, we'll get the cash.

01:02:15.485 --> 01:02:16.733
No.

01:02:16.735 --> 01:02:17.818
Your men can't be involved.

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:18.820
What?

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:20.445
We just can't take that chance.

01:02:20.447 --> 01:02:22.365
I don't want anything
to happen to her.

01:02:22.367 --> 01:02:23.907
Trust us.

01:02:23.909 --> 01:02:25.536
OK?

01:02:25.536 --> 01:02:26.827
Trust us.

01:02:31.918 --> 01:02:34.670
Joanna!

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.128
Joanna!

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:37.255
Joanna!

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:38.548
Joanna!

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.382
Joanna!

01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:40.217
Help!

01:02:42.929 --> 01:02:43.970
Joanna!

01:02:43.972 --> 01:02:45.181
Turn that off.

01:02:47.141 --> 01:02:48.224
Joanna!

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:55.774
Joanna!

01:02:57.818 --> 01:02:58.860
Scream again, nah.

01:02:58.862 --> 01:02:59.988
Scream again!

01:03:02.657 --> 01:03:07.871
Keep it off.

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:16.338
Joanna!

01:03:19.632 --> 01:03:20.467
Yeah.

01:03:28.641 --> 01:03:30.643
Keep cool, eh.

01:03:30.643 --> 01:03:31.478
Keep cool.

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:39.441
Jake.

01:03:39.443 --> 01:03:40.275
It's getting late,
we should start going back.

01:03:40.277 --> 01:03:41.693
I'm not ready yet.

01:03:41.695 --> 01:03:43.028
But if we get lost,
we're not gonna be able...

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:44.155
I'm not ready yet!

01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:51.371
Hello?

01:03:51.373 --> 01:03:52.454
They called.

01:03:52.456 --> 01:03:54.958
They want ransom.

01:03:54.958 --> 01:03:55.958
She's safe?

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.958
I don't know.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.876
Please come home, Jake.

01:03:57.878 --> 01:04:00.880
Come home, Jake!

01:04:22.903 --> 01:04:25.070
"My kidnapper."

01:04:25.072 --> 01:04:26.572
You think yuh smart, eh?

01:04:26.574 --> 01:04:28.157
Sorry, I forgot.

01:04:28.159 --> 01:04:31.159
If you pull anything
like that again, woman.

01:04:31.161 --> 01:04:43.048
My name is Joanna.

01:04:43.048 --> 01:04:44.798
What?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.844
Just doh try me again.

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:04.403
You know, it must be rel nice.

01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:09.740
Your father is a rel good man,
yuh know.

01:05:09.742 --> 01:05:13.621
Dying, and in the bush
looking for you.

01:05:15.414 --> 01:05:16.248
Hm.

01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:21.253
You know, I never had one.

01:05:24.173 --> 01:05:27.092
My brother
used to teach me things.

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:32.057
Yuh could say
he was like mih fadda.

01:05:36.853 --> 01:05:38.063
Doh worry, girl.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.646
When yuh get outta here,

01:05:41.648 --> 01:05:44.858
yuh could write a book
about this whole thing.

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:49.988
And then both ah we
could be rich.

01:05:51.076 --> 01:05:51.909
Rich?

01:05:55.329 --> 01:05:59.164
Writers write 'cause they
have something to say.

01:05:59.166 --> 01:06:02.420
Well, you will have
plenty to say now.

01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:06.296
Something seriously wrong
with you.

01:06:06.298 --> 01:06:08.257
You're fucking up my
whole life, my family...

01:06:08.259 --> 01:06:10.094
I don't give a fuck.

01:06:11.679 --> 01:06:14.139
Really,
I could really care less.

01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:19.184
A man have to look out for
himself, first and foremost.

01:06:19.186 --> 01:06:21.979
If is one thing
Georgie teach me,

01:06:21.981 --> 01:06:25.525
he right.

01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:27.943
A man is always in control.

01:06:27.945 --> 01:06:29.320
What about women?

01:06:29.322 --> 01:06:30.155
Women?

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:35.742
Woman should never
be in control.

01:06:35.744 --> 01:06:40.039
So who you gonna share
all your money with?

01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:44.295
Mihself.

01:06:44.295 --> 01:06:47.045
And mih girl, if da is
what yuh getting at.

01:06:50.135 --> 01:06:53.888
Yeah, girl who you
treat so well, I'm sure.

01:06:56.266 --> 01:06:57.305
Shh.

01:07:01.186 --> 01:07:04.063
I don't think she respects
a man who degrades women,

01:07:04.065 --> 01:07:06.400
she's probably afraid of you.

01:07:08.235 --> 01:07:10.403
That's not a real relationship.

01:07:10.405 --> 01:07:13.530
You ever had
a real relationship?

01:07:13.532 --> 01:07:15.450
And I think you do care.

01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:16.450
You do give a fuck!

01:07:16.452 --> 01:07:18.077
Hush yuh mouth
or I'll hush it for yuh!

01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:18.913
A, a, a!

01:07:20.498 --> 01:07:21.875
Look who it is.

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:24.124
Turn around, boy.

01:07:24.126 --> 01:07:25.461
Turn around, boy!

01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:32.677

01:07:34.179 --> 01:07:35.387

01:07:39.224 --> 01:07:43.101
You graduate from petty
thief to big-time kidnapper!

01:07:44.898 --> 01:07:50.320
Once I get the ransom,
I split it with you, 50-50.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.153
Serious?

01:07:56.992 --> 01:07:58.242
Wha 'bout if I just take she
right now?

01:07:58.244 --> 01:08:01.289
Look, Prowler, dais...

01:08:01.289 --> 01:08:03.331

I'll have your money

01:08:09.297 --> 01:08:10.380
Two days.

01:08:10.382 --> 01:08:11.215
I swear.

01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:18.430
Lil' Albert, boy.

01:08:20.557 --> 01:08:23.267

Why did he say he owes you?

01:10:18.342 --> 01:10:20.010
I help him once.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:24.680
Georgie push him down
in the same river,

01:10:24.682 --> 01:10:26.309
and he nearly drown.

01:10:32.981 --> 01:10:35.441
You saved his life.

01:10:35.443 --> 01:10:36.651

01:10:36.653 --> 01:10:40.362

But I get back Georgie, doh.

01:10:49.373 --> 01:10:53.252
Yuh ask me if I know
what a real relationship is.

01:10:54.962 --> 01:10:59.926

Two days pass, then I hear

01:11:22.948 --> 01:11:25.576
So I pass by the window, to see.

01:11:29.663 --> 01:11:34.418
He and Keke on the couch, yes.

01:11:37.296 --> 01:11:38.130

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:40.216
I get so vex.

01:11:52.479 --> 01:12:01.112
Just so.

01:12:01.112 --> 01:12:02.652
He deserve that.

01:12:02.654 --> 01:12:05.240
He had that coming for years.

01:12:12.707 --> 01:12:14.999

01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:17.376

01:12:40.484 --> 01:12:43.320
Been alone ever since.

Where are you, babe?

01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:55.098
Tyler, stop the car.

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.351
Go back.

01:13:56.353 --> 01:13:57.809
You should go home.

01:13:57.811 --> 01:13:59.519
They made contact, let
the police handle it.

01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:02.647
Boy, do not
make me repeat myself.

01:14:02.649 --> 01:14:04.192
Go back!

01:14:22.671 --> 01:14:26.466
What are you doing?

01:14:26.466 --> 01:14:28.383
Al, no, please.

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:29.424

Don't, please!

01:14:35.432 --> 01:14:36.266
No!

01:14:37.185 --> 01:14:39.143
Don't do this! No!

01:14:42.064 --> 01:14:42.898
Please!

01:14:44.067 --> 01:14:45.232
Please don't!

01:14:45.234 --> 01:14:46.442
Shut! Shut!

01:14:46.444 --> 01:14:47.943
Shut the fuck up!

01:15:02.377 --> 01:15:03.835
No!

01:15:40.247 --> 01:15:41.875
Fuck you, Georgie.

01:15:44.043 --> 01:15:46.421
A man is always in control.

01:16:22.332 --> 01:16:23.705
Here.

01:16:23.707 --> 01:16:25.042
Yuh like to read?

01:16:29.088 --> 01:16:31.214
Yuh go like da one.

01:16:31.216 --> 01:16:32.757
Da book taught me about life.

01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:37.096
It never teach you
about respect.

01:16:37.096 --> 01:16:40.807
You hadda prove yourself
to get respect.

01:16:40.809 --> 01:16:43.851
The world is how the world is.

01:16:48.524 --> 01:16:49.358
Food.

01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:05.225
Fucking trap, it eh working.

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:13.734
Joanna!

01:18:17.113 --> 01:18:17.947
Hey!

01:18:29.876 --> 01:18:30.710

Yuh cyah run from me, gyal.

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:41.218
Where do you think you're going?

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.054
Eh?

01:18:44.056 --> 01:18:46.518
I will give yuh a head start.

01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:54.317
Is this necessary?

01:18:58.654 --> 01:18:59.488
Trust?

01:19:00.823 --> 01:19:03.156
Trust and love is an illusion.

01:19:03.158 --> 01:19:03.992
A myth.

01:19:04.868 --> 01:19:07.285
Life taught me that.

01:19:07.287 --> 01:19:09.955
The only real thing is power.

01:19:09.957 --> 01:19:10.915
You can't just take power.

01:19:10.917 --> 01:19:11.958
Eh-heh?

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.875
Who say so, you?

01:19:13.877 --> 01:19:16.797
Who have none right now?

01:19:18.882 --> 01:19:21.176
They just a bunch ah cowards.

01:19:23.637 --> 01:19:26.723
They doh have the smarts to
get away with what I doing.

01:19:26.725 --> 01:19:29.769
You feel this is smart?

01:19:29.769 --> 01:19:32.562
Both of us might end up dead.

01:19:32.564 --> 01:19:36.482
And even if not, what're
you gonna do, run forever?

01:19:36.484 --> 01:19:38.567
From the police?

01:19:38.569 --> 01:19:40.695
From the man by the river?

01:19:43.699 --> 01:19:47.828
From Georgie?

01:19:47.828 --> 01:19:49.496
You're the coward.

01:19:58.797 --> 01:19:59.631
Hm.

01:21:02.237 --> 01:21:04.489
Who is the coward now, eh?

01:21:22.966 --> 01:21:28.137
Sit down.

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.146
You're right.

01:21:39.356 --> 01:21:42.527
I could never survive
out here alone.

01:21:44.154 --> 01:21:46.028
But you can.

01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:47.905
Yeah, doh worry.

01:21:47.907 --> 01:21:49.240
I'll take care of you.

01:21:54.079 --> 01:21:56.166
Your plan's gonna work.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:01.544
When you get the money,
you can start a new life.

01:22:01.546 --> 01:22:02.380
Yeah.

01:22:04.048 --> 01:22:06.301
You outsmarted everyone.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.137
Just a bunch ah cowards.

01:22:14.141 --> 01:22:20.105
Cowards.

01:22:22.233 --> 01:22:23.068
Al.

01:22:25.069 --> 01:22:25.903
Please.

01:22:37.664 --> 01:22:39.501
No more foolishness?

01:22:47.634 --> 01:22:49.467
I will never forget
what that emptiness

01:22:49.469 --> 01:22:51.304
in his eyes showed me.

01:22:52.805 --> 01:22:55.430
For him, hope was an illusion.

01:22:55.432 --> 01:22:57.644
Dis wha I could plan.

01:22:58.144 --> 01:22:59.396
But for me,

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.480
it's all I have.

01:23:03.524 --> 01:23:04.941
Doh forget to tell dem
come alone eh.

01:23:04.943 --> 01:23:05.942
With a cellphone.

01:23:05.944 --> 01:23:07.110
And, no police.

01:23:07.112 --> 01:23:08.193
I practiced it
a million times.

01:23:08.195 --> 01:23:10.864
A million and one is better.

01:23:21.251 --> 01:23:24.419
Drive to Toco and stop by
the telephone substation.

01:23:25.546 --> 01:23:28.339
Once there,
call for further directions.

01:23:28.341 --> 01:23:29.799
Make sure you're alone,
the windows are down,

01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:31.592
and the lights are on inside.

01:23:31.594 --> 01:23:33.218
The kidnapper said
if there's any sign

01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:36.304
of police involvement, the deal
is off and they'll kill me.

01:23:36.306 --> 01:23:39.767
Follow instructions, my
release is guaranteed.

01:23:39.769 --> 01:23:40.603
OK?

01:23:41.645 --> 01:23:42.728
No police!

01:23:58.496 --> 01:24:00.705
We have to wait
for further instructions.

01:24:00.707 --> 01:24:04.125
We are on our way now, the
police say they have a plan.

01:24:04.127 --> 01:24:04.961
Okay.

01:24:07.546 --> 01:24:09.088

01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:10.255

She's not here,
but she's safe.

01:27:14.192 --> 01:27:15.732

that you've asked for,

01:27:15.734 --> 01:27:18.318

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:25.578
Open it.

01:27:25.578 --> 01:27:26.413
Slowly.

01:27:36.588 --> 01:27:38.296
No.

01:27:38.298 --> 01:27:41.299
No, you don't get that until
you give me my daughter.

01:27:41.301 --> 01:27:42.929
I said she's safe.

01:27:44.305 --> 01:27:46.638

01:27:58.069 --> 01:28:00.318

01:28:48.243 --> 01:28:49.160

01:28:49.162 --> 01:28:50.327
Where is she?

01:28:50.329 --> 01:28:51.536
She wasn't with him.

01:28:51.538 --> 01:28:52.914
- Oh my God!
- She wasn't with him.

01:28:52.916 --> 01:28:53.705
Honey!

01:28:53.707 --> 01:28:54.958
What happened?

01:29:03.342 --> 01:29:04.551
What was that?

01:29:05.386 --> 01:29:06.385
I got the money.

01:29:06.387 --> 01:29:07.430
Go home now.

01:29:08.555 --> 01:29:10.639
I heard a gunshot.

01:29:10.641 --> 01:29:11.975
It's nothing.

01:29:12.851 --> 01:29:14.477
It just went off.

01:29:14.479 --> 01:29:15.602
Nobody got hurt.

01:29:15.604 --> 01:29:16.603
You're lying!

01:29:50.597 --> 01:29:52.016
It's killing me.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.062
I can't believe
I let him get away.

01:29:58.064 --> 01:30:00.606
Oh Jake, there's nothing
you could have done.

01:30:00.608 --> 01:30:03.442
Honey, you have to have faith.

01:30:03.444 --> 01:30:05.279
She's gonna come home.

01:30:09.492 --> 01:30:10.784
God, I hope so.

01:31:28.529 --> 01:31:29.363
Help!

01:31:38.497 --> 01:31:39.705
Help!

01:31:39.707 --> 01:31:40.541
Please!

01:31:41.542 --> 01:31:43.125
Please!

01:31:43.127 --> 01:31:44.626
Help!

01:32:18.537 --> 01:32:20.705
It's okay. It's okay.

01:32:20.707 --> 01:32:21.705
You're hurt.

01:32:21.707 --> 01:32:23.750
No, don't worry about me,
let it go.

01:32:23.752 --> 01:32:25.043
Don't worry about me.

01:32:25.045 --> 01:32:26.710
I'm just glad you're safe.

01:32:30.257 --> 01:32:31.800
I love you so much.

01:32:33.345 --> 01:32:34.846
I love you so much.

01:32:36.555 --> 01:32:37.723
Look who's here.

01:32:39.893 --> 01:32:40.726
Hi.

01:32:46.774 --> 01:32:48.066
I promise I didn't read it.

01:33:19.306 --> 01:33:21.391
Drop your weapon, this over.

01:33:21.393 --> 01:33:23.058
Not over!

01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:24.893
The spore of despair
spreads deep

01:33:24.895 --> 01:33:27.231
in the decay of self-worth.

01:33:28.190 --> 01:33:30.191
There, beneath the canopy
of cruelty,

01:33:30.193 --> 01:33:35.028
where the light of love
and trust are seldom shone.

01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:38.616
But there is freedom for none
who secretly savor the pain

01:33:38.618 --> 01:33:40.704
and let it be their keeper.

01:33:42.162 --> 01:33:43.955
I not afraid ah you.

01:33:43.957 --> 01:33:48.168
Drop the weapon.

01:33:48.168 --> 01:33:49.168
Take him down!

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.687
Let justice
be the real casualty.

01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:11.898
Dad, you fought a brave battle.

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.235
Now, you're free.

01:34:21.703 --> 01:34:25.495
I need no illusions of reprise,
or other emotional fiction,

01:34:25.497 --> 01:34:29.500
for I have my faith in God,
and my faith in myself,

01:34:29.502 --> 01:34:31.713
to be my lasting conviction.
