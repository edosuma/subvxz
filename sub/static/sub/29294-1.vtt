04:25.566 --> 04:26.665
you know.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.600
It could affect your future.

I don't know Dad,

04:29.803 --> 04:31.837
seems like bunch of

I mean, I watch the news

she's got her head screwed on
right, don't you think Mom?

04:46.353 --> 04:49.454
Sure, she talks a lot
more sense than Richard.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.427
You never miss an
opportunity to shoot me

04:55.429 --> 04:57.429

do ya, Delyth?

04:57.431 --> 05:00.732

05:03.637 --> 05:04.970
Oh.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.304
Look who decided to grace
us with her presence.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.373
You were up late last night.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.909
We're on vacation.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.377
Well, maybe you should
lay off that stuff,

05:12.379 --> 05:14.012
it's affecting your sleep.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.982
Relax Mom, it's not
like I'm shooting crack.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.384
Now, don't be crass.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.787
Uh sweetheart, you wanna
go into town with me later?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.322
I need to pick up
a few presents.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.691
Oh, last minute as
always.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.660
Just us?

05:27.661 --> 05:29.628
Yeah, I could use your
advice on what I should get.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.467
Um, what are the
rest of you doing?

05:36.470 --> 05:40.539
Your Mom is taking Linnea
and I over to the lake.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.540
And I'm not invited?

05:45.746 --> 05:49.381
Hey! Hey, come on.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.049
What am I, chopped
liver over here?

05:51.051 --> 05:54.920
Come on, don't you wanna hang
out with your dear old dad?

05:56.056 --> 05:56.988
Okay.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.623
Yeah, sure.

06:06.567 --> 06:10.135
<i> You're listening to</i>
<i>the 808 show on KSOC Radio.</i>

06:12.139 --> 06:14.072
Hey, you okay?

06:17.478 --> 06:20.011
Mom's favoritism strikes again.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.913
What do you mean?

06:21.914 --> 06:23.814
She wants you to go to the
lake with Grams, not me.

06:23.817 --> 06:24.967
Oh come on.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.118
Aren't you being a
little over-sensitive?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.053
No, she always does
stuff like this.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.855
You know, when we move out,

06:29.857 --> 06:33.058
I bet they preserve
your room like a shrine.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.993
They'll turn mine into a gym.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.928
It's not funny.

06:36.930 --> 06:40.132
I'm not laughing at you,
I'm picturing Dad in a gym.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.402
Right?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.776
So, I didn't want this
to be the one gift

06:50.778 --> 06:52.978
that you get to open
on Christmas Eve.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.081
But I want you to have it now.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.049
- What is it?
- Open it and find out.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.058
You have a beautiful
gift for writing.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.194
I thought this might
help you to use it more.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.632
I only got you socks.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.438
Look, I don't know what's
going on with you and Mom,

07:19.440 --> 07:21.540
but I'm sure things will
work themselves out.

07:23.010 --> 07:23.975
I love you, okay?

07:25.078 --> 07:25.977
I love you, too.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.480
Do you like it?

07:28.482 --> 07:30.682
I love it.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.892
Any calls?

07:40.894 --> 07:42.594
The one from the station
down at Fort Creek,

07:42.596 --> 07:44.629
there was a pretty nasty
beatin' on the side of the road.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.764
Happened right on the border,

07:45.766 --> 07:47.566
so they're just
keepin' us in the loop.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.467
Well, who's the victim?

07:48.469 --> 07:50.068
A girl in her 20s.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.637
She's at the hospital in a coma.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.139
Doctors don't know
if she'll make it.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.075
Jesus Christ.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.711
Someone cracked her in the
head and took off with her car.

08:00.647 --> 08:04.883
Okay.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.585
Sheriff's office.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.256
Yeah, okay Marvin,
okay, calm down.

08:12.693 --> 08:17.229
Yeah, yeah okay, we'll
be right over, yeah.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.100
Marvin Elrod.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.237
Someone broke into
his store last night.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.271
You're kiddin'.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.840
We better go take a look.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.898
- Hello.
<i>-  Hey, big brother.</i>

08:53.600 --> 08:54.766
Oh, hey Mike, how's it goin'?

08:54.768 --> 08:56.268
<i> Can't complain.</i>

08:56.270 --> 08:58.169
Cool, are you still
comin' over later?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.205
<i>It's gonna be a little
later than planned.</i>

09:00.207 --> 09:01.940
<i>Susie's got a doctor's
appointment,</i>

09:01.942 --> 09:04.276
<i>and her car broke down.
I gotta take her.</i>

09:04.278 --> 09:06.845
Oh, okay, that's no problem.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.313
Is she comin' over with you?

09:08.315 --> 09:11.216
<i>Nah, she's workin' the
2 'til 10 shift tonight.</i>

09:11.852 --> 09:16.855
All right, oh, we're goin'
out for a couple hours later,

09:16.857 --> 09:18.256
just in case we're not
back when you get here,

09:18.258 --> 09:20.559
I'm gonna leave a key under
the mat by the front door.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.016
<i>Thanks, Rich.</i>

09:22.017 --> 09:23.005
<i>I'll see ya later.</i>

09:23.006 --> 09:23.994
All right, see ya later.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.265
Hey.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.303
You still gonna go out
with me later or what?

09:31.305 --> 09:32.737
Sure.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.206
You didn't seem to
happy about it earlier.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.208
Oh, come on, I'd
barely gotten up.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.878
You know before my first
coffee, I'm a mess.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.647
Yeah, you're not much
of a morning person.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.883
I wasn't either, until
I met your mother.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.052
It's funny how gettin'
woken up at 7 a.m.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.187
for 30 years'll get
you into a routine.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.827
Hey, you know she just
gives us a hard time

09:55.829 --> 09:56.895
'cause she loves us.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.297
Yeah, I know.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.101
But she's
still your biggest fan.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.971
I mean, she still gushes
about all those stories

10:05.973 --> 10:07.205
you wrote in school.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.774
What's with the big sell, Dad?

10:10.911 --> 10:15.080
Well, I've been noticing
a little bit of tension

10:15.082 --> 10:16.748
between you two lately.

10:17.184 --> 10:21.886
Yeah, it's just
mother-daughter stuff, I guess.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.122
Nothing for you to worry about.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.726
Well, I do worry about it.

10:28.929 --> 10:32.263
A lot, it's my prerogative
as father, I'm allowed to.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.002
And you know why, I
mean, I lost my mother

10:37.004 --> 10:40.639
when I was your
age, and, you know,

10:40.641 --> 10:44.376
I never really got
a chance to tell her

10:48.181 --> 10:49.264
how much she meant to me.

10:49.265 --> 10:50.348
Sometimes you don't know
what you got 'til it's gone.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.820
That's unusually
profound for you, Dad.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.125
Yeah, I guess
I'm just kind of a sucker

11:00.127 --> 11:01.292
for this time of year.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.428
Yep, once the
Christmas trees go up,

11:03.430 --> 11:06.131
I get all warm and gooey inside

11:06.133 --> 11:07.899
and sentimental about family.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.137
The rest of the year, y'all
are just a pain in my ass.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.241
Hey, but you
know I wouldn't have it

11:16.243 --> 11:17.275
any other way.

11:40.767 --> 11:44.002
So, are we going to midnight
mass on Christmas Eve?

11:44.004 --> 11:46.771
Ma, you're a stickler for
tradition, so I guess so.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.377
You know, I wish you went
to church every Sunday.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.213
We're not gonna have this
conversation again, are we?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.483
I just don't know
where I lost you.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.920
You never lost me, Mom,
the church did, hm?

12:02.989 --> 12:07.058
But you never explained
why, not in detail.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.426
You still go to church.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.395
I wouldn't want
to denigrate that.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.231
I'm a big girl,
Pat, I can take it.

12:14.901 --> 12:15.800
Okay.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.804
Do you remember
that year I went touring

12:19.806 --> 12:22.474
with a local church
before the kids were born,

12:22.476 --> 12:25.343
and I went to Ghana
for a couple of weeks?

12:25.345 --> 12:26.878
Yeah, I remember.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.446
Well, this may come
as a surprise to you,

12:28.448 --> 12:32.283
but there are a lot of corrupt
churches here in the US.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.253
I know because I spent
most of that year at them.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.389
There was this one church,
it was Easter Sunday,

12:38.391 --> 12:40.825
and right before the service,

12:40.826 --> 12:43.260
the pastors are screaming at
each other, arguing over money.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.298
I saw so many things that
year that made me realize

12:47.300 --> 12:50.802
that the church is just
blinded by capitalism

12:50.804 --> 12:54.405
and desperate to keep
a grip on authority.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.107
You know Mom, sometimes I wonder

12:56.109 --> 12:59.310
if they actually read the
same New Testament we did.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.545
There was this one church,

13:00.547 --> 13:04.182
they were holding a
fundraiser for $40,000

13:04.184 --> 13:06.050
for a parking lot.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.553
Oh, they already had a perfectly
functioning parking lot,

13:08.555 --> 13:10.822
no, but they needed
anther one, a nicer one,

13:10.824 --> 13:14.125
and the were prepared to
fleece their flock to get it.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.426
You know, when you see enough

13:15.428 --> 13:17.529
of the dirty underbelly of
the church, you're just,

13:17.531 --> 13:21.099
you're left with a really
nasty taste in your mouth.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.536
It's all just politics,
hypocrisy, and gossip,

13:24.538 --> 13:27.806
and it completely obscures the
true message of Christianity.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.543
Wow, tell me what you
really think, Pat.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.812
Well, you asked, Mom.

13:33.814 --> 13:38.216
How must you feel then, about
me going to a place every week

13:38.218 --> 13:39.851
that you think is so corrupt?

13:39.853 --> 13:41.386
Oh, Mom.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.957
I know you have
a genuine belief.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.059
Just because the
institution is corrupt

13:48.061 --> 13:49.828
doesn't mean that your faith is.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.564
Do you have faith?

13:53.834 --> 13:54.566
I do.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.467
I do, but I don't
need the church

13:56.469 --> 13:58.269
to tell me what to believe.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.172
I have my own perception
of a higher power.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.577
Well, I'm glad you have
something, some faith.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.045
Why does it matter to you?

14:08.615 --> 14:10.148
You know, as you get older,

14:10.150 --> 14:14.252
you begin to recognize
your own mortality.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.522
It's difficult not to
think of the inevitable.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.626
I'm just comforted by the fact
that I'm part of God's plan,

14:21.628 --> 14:25.263
and that, well, there's
more to everything

14:25.265 --> 14:27.498
than just this physical world.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.635
I love you, Mom.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.271
I love you too, honey.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.615
- Let's get soup.
- Yes.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.554
Damn kids these days
don't respect nothin'.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.224
I ran this business 20
years, never had a problem.

14:53.226 --> 14:57.228
Now, they break in
and ransack the joint.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.630
So you got a look at them?

14:58.632 --> 15:00.348
Nah.

15:00.349 --> 15:02.065
They broke in after I
closed up for the night.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.903
Then how do you
know it was kids?

15:04.905 --> 15:08.406
Stole a couple masks from
the novelty department.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.508
What kind of an adult
wants that shit?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.643
They take anything else?

15:11.645 --> 15:13.411
Cleared out the register.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.614
I'd already cashed up,
so they didn't get much.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.650
A few dollars, some change.

15:18.652 --> 15:21.052
Clothes rail got turned over.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.655
I think they took some coats.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.591
Probably needed 'em,
scruffy little bastards.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.127
What else?

15:29.129 --> 15:31.529
They also took my firearms.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.464
One pistol from
under the counter,

15:33.466 --> 15:36.100
another one from
the office upstairs.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.468
You got permits
for those, right?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.537
Who you investigatin'
here, sonny?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.272
Me or the thieves?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.975
Just routine questions,
Marv, nothin' personal.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.611
Do you got a camera
set up in the store?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.314
Never thought I
needed one until now.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.150
Okay.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.953
Deputy Wilkes and I'll
take a look around.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.722
In the meantime,
just try to relax.

15:57.724 --> 16:01.192
How can anyone relax with
this kinda thing goin' on?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.428
You wanna know who I blame?

16:03.430 --> 16:07.532
All that heavy metal pollutin'
the minds of our children,

16:07.534 --> 16:12.704
encouragin' devil worship and
all that satanic nonsense.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.706
Those headbangers,

16:14.707 --> 16:16.707
they're a danger to
god-fearin' folk everywhere.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.746
What do you think?

16:23.049 --> 16:25.450
I think he needs to
chill the fuck out.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.684
Heavy metal is awesome.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.620
About the robbery.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.759
Masks, guns, I guess
it could be kids.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.363
Or, somethin' very different.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.731
Like what?

16:39.733 --> 16:42.533
Someone could be gearin'
up for another robbery.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.736
Somethin' bigger.

16:44.738 --> 16:49.440
Makes sense, but what are
potential targets around here,

16:49.442 --> 16:51.242
the liquor store, the bank?

16:51.244 --> 16:52.477
Maybe.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.747
Tell you what, I'll get
Richards and Daniels

16:55.749 --> 16:57.448
to take the patrol downtown.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.250
And if it's about to happen,

16:59.252 --> 17:02.020
maybe a police
presence will deter it.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.421
Good thinking.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.491
Let's take a look around.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.732
- This should be nice.
- Ooh.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.701
Come on, honey.

17:30.116 --> 17:32.784
Oh hey, we'll catch you
back here around two.

17:32.786 --> 17:33.751
- Sure, bye!
- Okay, bye-bye!

17:33.753 --> 17:34.719
See ya later!

18:03.183 --> 18:04.248
Oh shit.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.617
What is it?

18:07.420 --> 18:08.853
John Bo Boubede died.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.924
Well who's that?

18:12.925 --> 18:15.159
I used to run with a candy
bandits gang back in Chicago.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.696
What's your
interest in a mafioso?

18:19.833 --> 18:22.867
Before I came to Oakley, I
used to work in Plumas County.

18:22.869 --> 18:23.835
Yeah, I remember.

18:23.837 --> 18:26.104
I ever tell you why I left?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.739
Somethin' about corruption
in the department, wasn't it?

18:28.741 --> 18:30.241
Yeah, that's right.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.710
Back in '81 we were called
to a quadruple homicide

18:32.712 --> 18:35.480
at a cabin in a
resort town in Keddie.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.117
Yeah.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.886
Wasn't that the murder
of a whole family, yeah?

18:41.888 --> 18:44.806
Yeah.

18:44.807 --> 18:47.725
The worst crime
scene I've ever seen.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.762
Four people savagely
butchered, mother Sue,

18:51.764 --> 18:56.834
son Johnny, daughter Tina,
and a family friend Dana.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.706
Tina's skull was found
a few years later,

19:01.708 --> 19:03.875
a couple years after
I left the department.

19:05.411 --> 19:09.280
Her body had been removed from
the cabin for some reason.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.153
I was the initial
responder to the 911 call.

19:16.523 --> 19:21.292
I saw those bodies, and that
sight will never leave me.

19:23.263 --> 19:27.899
The killers had stabbed and
pummeled everything in sight.

19:27.901 --> 19:31.936
The walls, the people,
the furniture, everything.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.771
There was blood everywhere.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.776
I knew right away it was the
work of a total psychopath.

19:40.413 --> 19:44.482
There was a couple living a
few cabins down, same resort,

19:44.484 --> 19:46.184
Marty and Marilyn.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.686
When they interviewed Marty,

19:48.688 --> 19:51.923
he was so concerned
about deflecting blame

19:51.925 --> 19:53.925
and throwing
suspicion on others.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.826
He slipped up so many
times in the interview,

19:55.828 --> 19:58.863
I knew he had something
to do with it.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.967
Marty was friends with Bo,

20:02.969 --> 20:04.402
who happened to be
staying with him

20:04.404 --> 20:05.803
at the time of the murders.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.373
Wait a minute, if memory serves,

20:09.375 --> 20:10.975
that case is still
unsolved, yeah?

20:10.977 --> 20:12.577
Yeah.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.513
Came out years later
that drug trafficking

20:15.515 --> 20:16.981
may have had something
to do with it,

20:16.983 --> 20:19.884
I mean, god knows what they
were all involved in down there.

20:19.886 --> 20:24.522
All I knew is I couldn't
do my job, so I got out.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.759
But there's not a day goes by

20:28.761 --> 20:31.229
I don't think about
the ones that got away.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.932
You know we all
got those regrets.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.635
The ones that got away.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.005
I've been lucky in the
most of the murder cases

20:41.007 --> 20:43.274
I've worked have been solved.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.943
The Reggie Fallon case,
that still plays on my mind.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.979
Yeah, what happened
with that one?

20:49.349 --> 20:52.283
Back in the 60s, Fallon taught
at Red Bridge High School,

20:52.285 --> 20:55.653
where he sexually
abused some boys.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.922
We began investigating, but
before we could make an arrest,

20:57.924 --> 21:01.559
Fallon quits his
job, disappears.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.960
Then a few years later,

21:02.962 --> 21:04.729
we found out that he'd
been back teaching

21:04.731 --> 21:06.430
in several counties across Utah

21:06.432 --> 21:10.434
using different names
and forged documents.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.769
Decades went by.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.740
Then one of the abused
boys, now an adult,

21:15.742 --> 21:17.842
bumps into Fallon
here in Oakley.

21:17.844 --> 21:22.913
This guy Frank takes advantage
of the chance encounter,

21:24.050 --> 21:25.883
gets a hold of Fallon's
address and phone number,

21:25.885 --> 21:27.952
which he passes on to us.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.488
I interview Frank, then
went looking for the files

21:30.490 --> 21:31.856
from the 1960s.

21:33.026 --> 21:34.925
A few of the old timers
on staff remember a box

21:34.927 --> 21:37.361
with "Reggie Fallon"
written on the side.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.897
No one knew where it had gone.

21:39.899 --> 21:43.000
So I have to start
all over again,

21:43.002 --> 21:46.804
tracking down abused boys
using old school photos

21:46.806 --> 21:50.041
and other records,
all with Frank's help.

21:50.043 --> 21:53.044
I found 18 victims in total.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.314
A few were keen to
prosecute, yeah?

21:56.316 --> 21:58.983
Others were dead, some just
wanted to put it behind them

21:58.985 --> 22:00.985
and get on with their lives,

22:00.987 --> 22:02.853
but we had nine of them on board

22:03.956 --> 22:05.756
and a very strong
case against Fallon.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.093
Then I found that he
fled to Australia.

22:11.364 --> 22:13.564
So after a lot of
bureaucratic red tape,

22:13.566 --> 22:15.599
an extradition order is issued.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.704
But before the time came
for the extradition hearing,

22:19.706 --> 22:22.724
Fallon hobbles in,

22:22.725 --> 22:25.743
presents himself as having
several serious health issues.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.611
The judge rules he's
too sick to travel,

22:27.613 --> 22:30.815
yet the cops over there
tell me that Fallon,

22:30.817 --> 22:32.850
whose lawyer had argued
could barely walk

22:32.852 --> 22:36.921
and was about to die,
was spotted near his home

22:36.923 --> 22:39.590
walking freely and unaided.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.693
He played the judge for a fool.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.131
It's a tough thing
to have to take.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.034
After re-opening old
wounds for all the victims,

22:50.036 --> 22:52.069
I had to tell them sorry,

22:52.071 --> 22:54.572
he abused you and
ruined your life,

22:54.574 --> 22:57.007
but he's not gonna
do one day in jail,

22:57.009 --> 22:59.510
and he's not gonna
be brought back.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.948
It's the most horrific thing
to have to tell someone

23:03.950 --> 23:05.483
after you got their hopes up.

23:07.019 --> 23:10.688
Injustice like that can really,
really chip away at you.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.758
It's a tough thing to take.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.160
Yeah, but you shouldn't
let it get you down.

23:16.162 --> 23:19.063
It should spur you
on to make it right.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.798
And unfortunately,

23:20.800 --> 23:24.802
that's something that will
always happen in this job,

23:24.804 --> 23:27.138
'cause there's never a
shortage of evil behavior.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.180
So there'll always be a
chance to make it right...

23:43.423 --> 23:46.757
...and find redemption.

24:26.732 --> 24:28.499
- Wow, it's cold out there.
- I'm glad we did that,

24:28.501 --> 24:30.034
though, it's beautiful.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.236
- You goin' upstairs, honey?
- Yeah.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.104
- Hot chocolate?
- Yes, please.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.740
Let's
get some lights on.

24:43.950 --> 24:44.915
What the hell?

25:17.283 --> 25:22.186
Don't look, don't
move, don't even breathe,

25:22.188 --> 25:24.788
or it'll be the last
breath you ever take.

25:25.525 --> 25:28.225
What, did Richard
and Tina come back?

25:28.227 --> 25:30.561
No, they wouldn't do
this, look what's--

25:33.165 --> 25:35.766
Did Tina and
Richard come back early?

25:35.768 --> 25:36.867
But why
would they do this?

25:36.869 --> 25:37.801
I don't know.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.169
Mom, what, Mom, Mom, Mom.

25:41.274 --> 25:42.740
Oh my god, Mom.

25:42.742 --> 25:43.941
Oh my god.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.209
I told
you to keep quiet!

25:54.186 --> 25:58.055
What, what do you
want, what do you want?

25:58.057 --> 25:59.189
All the
cash in your purse.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.291
Give it to me.

26:00.293 --> 26:01.225
Okay, okay.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.128
Okay, here, here.

26:04.130 --> 26:07.298
Please, just take it and
leave us alone, please.

26:07.300 --> 26:10.134
- That's all you got?
- Yes, yes, just take it,

26:10.136 --> 26:12.603
don't hurt us, please, please.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.171
Give me your purse.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.775
I won't.

26:20.613 --> 26:22.780
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

26:28.354 --> 26:29.770
Yes, you did.

26:29.771 --> 26:31.187
I said I'm not
giving you my purse.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.723
Mom, just give it to him.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.992
Shut the fuck up!

26:47.273 --> 26:49.640
Now let's try this again.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.344
Give me your fuckin' purse.

26:55.181 --> 26:58.282
I've worked hard all
my life for my money.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.751
I'm not giving it to
a monster like you.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.325
Looks like
we got a hero.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.060
You wanna be a hero, grandma?

27:11.230 --> 27:13.797
Mom, please, just
give it to him.

27:16.235 --> 27:19.003
If you don't give
me your fucking purse

27:19.005 --> 27:21.005
by the time I count to three,

27:21.007 --> 27:25.142
I will be prying it from
your cold, dead fingers.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.311
One.

27:37.390 --> 27:38.355
Two.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.004
Okay, you win, you win.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.082
Jesus.

28:05.084 --> 28:08.285
You live in a big place like
this, you can't be fuckin' poor.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.788
We're just a normal
family, please.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.089
We're not rich.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.927
Guess we'll just wait
for Pops to come back, huh?

28:17.430 --> 28:19.096
Maybe we should take
his car and find us a place

28:19.098 --> 28:20.798
where they've got
some real money.

28:22.068 --> 28:25.035
I feel sorry for your mothers.

28:30.976 --> 28:34.311
You got some
spunk for an old broad.

28:35.481 --> 28:36.313
I like that.

28:43.789 --> 28:46.056
You feel sorry for who?

28:48.928 --> 28:53.063
Come on, say it again,
who do you feel sorry for?

28:54.366 --> 28:58.268
- Just get outta here.
- First, answer the question.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.804
Who do you feel sorry for?

29:00.806 --> 29:03.240
- Just get the hell out!
- You stay the fuck down!

29:05.311 --> 29:06.477
You animal!

29:09.115 --> 29:12.249
Oh, you had the
courage to say it once,

29:12.251 --> 29:14.284
just say it again.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.020
Your life may just depend on it.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.290
I said I feel sorry
for your mother.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.435
Now I lay me down to sleep

29:31.437 --> 29:34.438
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

29:38.377 --> 29:41.311
You like to pray, huh?

29:45.484 --> 29:47.084
Answer me this.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.821
If there's a god and
you believe in him,

29:50.823 --> 29:54.458
why isn't he striking me
down right now to save you?

29:54.460 --> 29:56.360
What?

29:56.362 --> 29:57.961
I mean why
doesn't he send

29:57.963 --> 30:01.799
a fucking lightning bolt
to crush in my skull

30:01.801 --> 30:04.101
and save one of his faithful?

30:07.373 --> 30:09.206
He may not strike you down now,

30:10.009 --> 30:13.410
but believe me, he will.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.379
- Oh, he will.
- One day.

30:15.381 --> 30:18.949
Always
a fuckin' answer.

30:18.951 --> 30:23.053
Always an answer to why
the big man don't show up.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.288
Have you ever
thought about this,

30:24.290 --> 30:26.423
maybe he just ain't
fuckin' there, hm?

30:27.426 --> 30:28.959
Or maybe he just
doesn't give a shit

30:28.961 --> 30:33.096
about you, about me,
about any of this.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.333
Finish your fucking prayer.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.202
I'm not praying for you.

30:39.972 --> 30:43.273
You better
fucking start.

30:43.275 --> 30:46.043
If you don't start
praying to your god,

30:46.579 --> 30:49.213
then you're gonna be
meeting him a lot earlier

30:49.215 --> 30:50.547
than you planned.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.119
Now I lay me down to sleep,

30:56.121 --> 30:59.089
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.425
If I should die before I wake,

31:01.427 --> 31:04.494
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

31:06.599 --> 31:08.031
Amen.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.271
Oh my god, oh my god.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.010
Grandma's fucking dead.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.912
It's the natural
order of things.

31:22.481 --> 31:23.881
Shut the fuck up!

31:24.350 --> 31:26.016
Next bullet's for your daughter.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.252
Sh-sh.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.231
What the
fuck is your problem?

31:43.168 --> 31:44.468
I thought we
were just gonna take

31:44.470 --> 31:46.453
their money and car
and get outta here.

31:46.454 --> 31:48.437
Yeah, well plans
fucking change, deal with it.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.173
It's just that--

31:50.175 --> 31:51.675
Are you
goin' soft on me?

31:52.611 --> 31:53.644
No.

31:55.648 --> 31:58.382
Look, I ain't here
to fuck around, okay, yeah?

31:58.384 --> 32:03.220
If someone's givin' me shit,
someone's gettin' in my way,

32:03.222 --> 32:06.123
one way or another, they're
getting out of my way.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.357
If you don't understand that,

32:07.359 --> 32:09.960
then go get yourself
a "born to lose" tattoo

32:09.962 --> 32:12.262
and get your chicken
ass back to the slammer.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.263
You understand me?

32:13.265 --> 32:15.332
I understand,

32:15.334 --> 32:17.267
ease the fuck up,
I ain't your enemy.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.204
When's Pops
comin' back, huh?

32:22.041 --> 32:24.308
Please, please, we
haven't seen your faces,

32:24.310 --> 32:25.642
so we can't identify you, okay?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.544
Please, just let us go, please?

32:28.580 --> 32:31.415
Please.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.730
- Look at me.
- No.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.300
- Look at me!
- No!

32:55.708 --> 32:59.409
Look at me, or you're gonna
be reunited with Grandma.

33:15.561 --> 33:17.194
Now you've seen my face.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.335
Why are you doing this?

33:26.071 --> 33:29.539
Because I can.

33:34.613 --> 33:39.282
The thing is, now
you can identify us.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.718
You know what that
means, don't you?

33:43.489 --> 33:45.088
What?

33:46.392 --> 33:49.059
We can't leave any witnesses.

33:53.065 --> 33:55.232
Please, you don't
have to do this.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.039
Witnesses ain't
gonna do us any good.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.179
What about hostage?

34:09.181 --> 34:12.748
That could help if you
get caught by the police.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.186
- You volunteering?
- Yes!

34:16.188 --> 34:17.754
- Yes, yes, yes,
- No.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.590
Take me, you let my
daughter go, please, please.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.592
What do you think?

34:24.830 --> 34:26.263
I don't know, if we...

34:27.331 --> 34:28.831
We run into trouble on the road.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.168
It could give us
somethin' to bargain with.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.304
- Right?
- It's a good point.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.309
Okay, we'll take a hostage.

34:40.411 --> 34:44.815
The thing is, we're only
gonna need one of you.

34:44.817 --> 34:48.652
Okay, take me, just let
my daughter go, please.

34:48.654 --> 34:52.789
We can't let anyone go,
you've seen our faces.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.563
- Well.
- What?

34:59.565 --> 35:01.832
One of you's gonna
be our hostage,

35:03.302 --> 35:07.370
and the other one, it's
the end of the road.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.372
- No, no, please!
- Just take my mom--

35:09.374 --> 35:10.807
- please take my mom.
- No, no stop.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.642
- Let me stay.
- Please.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.711
Shut the fuck up!

35:14.713 --> 35:15.779
Both of you.

35:20.219 --> 35:21.718
If you can't make a decision,

35:21.720 --> 35:24.254
I'm gonna have to
make it for you.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.755
- No.
- It's okay, it's okay.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.157
- No.
- Shh, shh.

35:28.861 --> 35:29.759
No, no.

35:33.866 --> 35:35.298
No, no!

35:36.668 --> 35:38.568
Miney, mo.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.806
Catch a bitch by her toe.

35:42.808 --> 35:46.910
If she don't holler, let her go.

35:48.347 --> 35:53.416
Eeny, meenie, miney.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.866
The fuck you waiting for,
get the fuck after her!

36:09.868 --> 36:10.767
Go on!

38:14.493 --> 38:15.925
Put the fucking knife down!

38:27.039 --> 38:30.307
I should kill you
right fuckin' here.

38:31.043 --> 38:32.375
Then why don't you?

38:32.377 --> 38:34.611
Because I'm a
fucking professional!

38:36.915 --> 38:38.481
Look, we're gonna
be takin' off soon,

38:38.483 --> 38:40.550
and we need leverage.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.753
You really think the cops
are gonna take a shot at us

38:43.755 --> 38:46.022
with your pretty
little ass in the car?

38:46.024 --> 38:48.858

I said I didn't want one.

40:05.704 --> 40:09.639
Look, I'm tryin' to
keep things civil.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.675
You call killing people civil?

40:17.149 --> 40:21.017
Those two gave me shit,

40:22.487 --> 40:24.187
and they paid the price.

40:25.957 --> 40:29.793

What?

41:15.841 --> 41:17.740
Listen.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.881
It sounds like
Daddy's home, huh?

41:26.651 --> 41:30.487
Ed, be a dear and run
outside and welcome him, huh?

41:30.489 --> 41:31.187
Leave him alone, ah!

41:31.189 --> 41:33.223
Listen to me, listen to me.

41:33.225 --> 41:35.258
You make a fuckin' sound,

41:35.260 --> 41:38.661
and Daddy goes down for the
dirt nap, you understand, huh?

41:40.732 --> 41:41.598
Right.

41:42.968 --> 41:47.770
Oh ,
hello, who are you?

41:52.110 --> 41:54.143
Your worst
fuckin' nightmare.

41:59.784 --> 42:02.519
Now get the fuck inside.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.889
Oh all right, all right, just
take it easy, take it easy.

42:07.592 --> 42:08.658
Okay, okay.

42:08.660 --> 42:09.692
Come on, princess.

42:10.595 --> 42:12.128
Move it!

42:12.931 --> 42:14.230
- Dad.
- Oh my god, are you okay?

42:14.232 --> 42:17.133
Does it look like
she's fuckin' okay, Pops?

42:17.135 --> 42:18.735
As much as she's
been through already,

42:18.737 --> 42:20.203
it's gonna get a
hell of a lot worse

42:20.205 --> 42:22.939
if you don't do exactly
as I say, you got that?

42:22.941 --> 42:24.674
- Okay, okay--
- Mom!

42:34.252 --> 42:37.287
Where the
fuck you goin' Pops?

42:44.863 --> 42:45.762
Patty?

43:09.854 --> 43:10.753
Patty.

43:14.292 --> 43:17.126
All right, that's
enough, Pops, come on.

43:23.702 --> 43:26.336
Time for you to start worryin'
about the family members

43:26.338 --> 43:28.972
who are still alive, yeah, hm?

43:36.881 --> 43:38.331
What do you want?

43:38.332 --> 43:39.782
First thing, all the
money in your wallet,

43:39.784 --> 43:41.250
and your credit cards.

43:41.252 --> 43:44.320
Then I want you to write
down those PIN numbers, okay?

43:53.298 --> 43:54.197
Okay.

44:10.348 --> 44:12.915
What are you doing, Sheriff?

44:12.917 --> 44:15.018
That beating at the roadside,

44:15.020 --> 44:17.220
the one on the
border at Fort Creek.

44:17.222 --> 44:18.388
Yeah, what about it?

44:18.390 --> 44:23.026
That happened over here
at Devil's Point, right?

44:23.028 --> 44:25.028
Yeah, Fort Creek PD
said the stolen car

44:25.030 --> 44:26.362
was seen heading east.

44:27.432 --> 44:29.932
Marvin's store is
over here on Madison.

44:31.336 --> 44:32.969
The only road comin' into
Oakley from Devil's Point

44:32.971 --> 44:34.871
runs right past there.

44:34.873 --> 44:36.272
So what are you sayin', Sheriff?

44:36.274 --> 44:38.408
I think the guys
who stole the car

44:38.410 --> 44:40.376
are the same people who
robbed Marvin's store.

44:40.378 --> 44:41.944
What makes you say that?

44:42.847 --> 44:44.113
Fax just came through.

44:45.250 --> 44:47.283
Two escaped convicts
from Salt Lake County.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.453
Von Taylor and Edward Deli.

44:50.455 --> 44:53.022
Von Taylor was convicted
of aggravated burglary,

44:53.291 --> 44:54.357
Deli for arson.

44:54.359 --> 44:57.126
I'm guessin' they're only
serving short sentences

44:57.128 --> 44:58.461
for those convictions.

44:58.463 --> 45:00.029
Why the hell would
somebody break out?

45:00.465 --> 45:01.931
Who knows.

45:01.932 --> 45:03.398
Some men just can't
stand to be caged.

45:03.401 --> 45:04.701
You think they're in town?

45:05.136 --> 45:06.135
Possibly.

45:06.137 --> 45:08.171
Or they could've
passed through already.

45:08.173 --> 45:11.040
But if these two did
rob Marvin's store,

45:11.042 --> 45:13.443
then they're armed,
and we need to be vigilant.

45:57.422 --> 45:59.288
These better be
the right numbers, Pops,

45:59.290 --> 46:00.523
'cause if I get to the bank,

46:00.525 --> 46:02.425
and I found out
that you stiffed me,

46:02.427 --> 46:05.328
I'm gonna kill
these girls, yeah?

46:05.330 --> 46:06.796
They are the right numbers.

46:06.798 --> 46:09.265
I wouldn't mess around
with my daughters' lives.

46:10.368 --> 46:11.801
Good, okay.

46:12.537 --> 46:14.337
I'm gonna need the
keys to your car.

46:20.378 --> 46:21.310
Okay.

46:21.513 --> 46:22.945
Are you leaving now?

46:23.414 --> 46:25.248
Yeah.

46:25.249 --> 46:27.083
We're taking these two
little bombshells with us.

46:27.085 --> 46:28.251
You don't need them.

46:28.253 --> 46:31.788
Two little white chicks
up here in Mormon country

46:31.790 --> 46:35.391
could come in handy if we need
to negotiate with the cops.

46:37.128 --> 46:42.131
Okay, look, fine, then just
take me and let them go.

46:42.133 --> 46:43.900
Look, they've been
through enough.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.413
I'm sorry, Pops.

46:58.416 --> 47:02.385
Two's company,
three's a crowd, okay?

47:04.088 --> 47:06.956
I'm gonna need you to
stay here with your wife.

47:09.994 --> 47:10.893
Permanently.

47:18.369 --> 47:19.502
Shoot this motherfucker.

47:19.504 --> 47:20.503
- No.
- Please, let him go.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.071
Shut the fuck up!

47:22.073 --> 47:23.005
Shoot him.

47:23.007 --> 47:25.174
I wanna see you
fuckin' shoot him.

47:32.317 --> 47:33.216
That's it.

47:37.555 --> 47:38.621
Yeah.

47:52.470 --> 47:55.404
- You don't have to do this.
- Shut up!

47:55.406 --> 47:56.339
Please don't, please!

47:57.475 --> 47:59.542
You really gonna
come at me, huh?

47:59.543 --> 48:01.610
After what happened to Mama
and that old bitch, huh?

48:04.549 --> 48:07.316
What the fuck are
you waiting for?

48:08.052 --> 48:09.552
Shoot him!

48:21.666 --> 48:24.533
Come on, you piece
of shit, come on.

48:40.551 --> 48:42.585
Fucking shit house.

48:42.587 --> 48:43.486
Fuck you!

48:47.659 --> 48:49.458
Can you come here and look after

48:49.460 --> 48:51.961
these little girls for me?

48:51.963 --> 48:53.963
Did you think you
can handle that, huh?

48:56.601 --> 48:57.433
All right, look.

48:57.435 --> 48:58.668
The fuck.

48:58.670 --> 49:01.003
Please, you have
all of our money,

49:01.005 --> 49:03.205
you've already destroyed
our lives, please just go

49:03.207 --> 49:04.674
and leave us alone!

49:04.676 --> 49:07.677
Look who decided to
grow some fuckin' balls, huh?

49:07.679 --> 49:10.112
We won't say anything,
just go, please.

49:27.565 --> 49:30.633
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

49:36.240 --> 49:37.540
Pops?

49:48.419 --> 49:51.487
Shhh, it's okay.

49:54.392 --> 49:57.126
I guess we have something
in common now, huh?

50:00.164 --> 50:02.131
We're all orphans, huh?

50:05.069 --> 50:06.335
Okay.

50:19.751 --> 50:21.050
Convicts are here.

50:21.052 --> 50:23.119
You want me to set
up road blocks?

50:23.121 --> 50:25.154
We don't have the man power
to handle the checkpoints.

50:25.156 --> 50:28.391
Liaise with the PDs at
Marion, Kamas, and Peoa.

50:28.393 --> 50:31.427
Call Daniels, Richards,
Benson, and Oldfield.

50:31.429 --> 50:33.496
Tell 'em I want a hard target
search of every house,

50:33.498 --> 50:35.564
convenience store,
bank, farmhouse,

50:35.566 --> 50:37.366
outhouse and shit house
in the area.

50:38.136 --> 50:40.336
Any cars reported
stolen in the last 24?

50:40.772 --> 50:41.704
Not that I know of.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.640
They might still be on foot.

50:44.642 --> 50:45.708
They could be close.

52:19.737 --> 52:21.270
Oh, Ed.

52:22.406 --> 52:24.240
What have we said
about manners, eh?

52:25.643 --> 52:28.878
It's always good manners
to take someone's coat

52:28.880 --> 52:31.413
when they arrive as a guest.

52:40.258 --> 52:42.825
You're a mighty fine twosome.

52:45.596 --> 52:48.531
I've been in prison a
couple years and you,

52:50.468 --> 52:52.768
you're a good damn
sight for sore eyes.

52:52.770 --> 52:54.637
Leave her alone
you fucking animal.

52:56.841 --> 52:58.440
Careful.

52:58.943 --> 53:01.777
You might get a load
in the face.

53:01.779 --> 53:03.279
You're disgusting.

53:08.953 --> 53:10.920
Take this one, take her.

53:12.290 --> 53:14.957
- Ow, you fucking asshole.
- Yeah, yeah.

53:14.959 --> 53:19.795
Oh yeah, you got a big
mouth, just like your sister.

53:19.797 --> 53:22.531
Let's see how
fuckin' big it can go, huh?

53:22.533 --> 53:23.432
Open it.

53:24.302 --> 53:26.936
Open your mouth...

53:28.673 --> 53:29.572
wide.

53:29.574 --> 53:33.209
- Stop it you sick fuck!
- Shut it!

53:33.211 --> 53:35.978
Come on, you little slut,
open your fucking mouth.

53:35.980 --> 53:39.682
That's it, nice and wide, wider.

53:48.993 --> 53:52.228
Ah, yeah.

53:53.297 --> 53:56.432
The fuck is that?

54:00.638 --> 54:01.937
Another car's coming.

54:04.976 --> 54:07.009
You expecting any visitors, no?

54:07.011 --> 54:08.711
- No.
- No?

54:08.713 --> 54:10.546
- You expecting anyone?
- No.

54:25.997 --> 54:26.895
Hello?

54:44.482 --> 54:45.381
Rich?

56:38.796 --> 56:39.595
Stay there.

56:40.998 --> 56:42.598
- Okay.
- Fuck.

56:45.669 --> 56:49.104
Look, let's take the car and
get the fuck outta here, Von.

56:49.106 --> 56:52.941
No, no, no, no.

56:55.880 --> 56:57.229
Not yet.

56:57.230 --> 56:58.579
I got some unfinished business.

56:58.582 --> 56:59.715
Like what?

57:01.619 --> 57:05.020
Like these two joining us
upstairs in the bedroom.

57:05.022 --> 57:06.188
We're not going anywhere.

57:06.190 --> 57:07.923
You sick bastard.

57:08.125 --> 57:10.492
Look, that guy
could call the cops.

57:10.494 --> 57:13.128
We need to get the
fuck outta here now.

57:13.130 --> 57:15.764
Call the cops and say what?

57:16.200 --> 57:20.035
No one was home up here, and,

57:21.038 --> 57:23.071
no one knows we're up here.

57:24.108 --> 57:27.176
It's just us and
these two girls.

57:30.681 --> 57:31.580
Okay.

57:33.184 --> 57:36.118
Let's go upstairs, give you
something else to swallow.

57:36.120 --> 57:38.854
You put anything in my mouth
and you'll fuckin' lose it.

57:38.856 --> 57:41.190
No, it's okay, we'll go.

57:42.226 --> 57:43.459
Let's get it over with.

57:47.731 --> 57:48.664
Linn.

57:48.799 --> 57:50.566
Just trust me on this.

57:50.568 --> 57:52.067
It's gonna be okay.

57:52.069 --> 57:53.202
Okay.

57:54.238 --> 57:56.104
Lead the way, ladies.

58:07.184 --> 58:10.118
You fuckin' shit house.

58:32.710 --> 58:34.510
I may be getting worried
over nothing here,

58:34.512 --> 58:37.913
but it's about my brother
Richard and his family.

58:37.915 --> 58:41.517
They have a holiday
cabin just off Oak Grove.

58:41.519 --> 58:43.519
I arranged to meet them
there this afternoon,

58:43.521 --> 58:46.755
they said they'd leave a key
out in case they were late.

58:46.757 --> 58:49.625
I got there, and
the car was outside,

58:49.627 --> 58:54.229
but no one answered the
door, no key left out.

58:54.231 --> 58:56.749
Then, just as I was leaving,

58:56.750 --> 58:59.268
I'm sure I saw something
move in the window,

58:59.270 --> 59:02.604
like someone was ducking
down or something.

59:03.774 --> 59:06.909
So how many are
there in the family?

59:06.911 --> 59:09.845
My brother Richard,
his wife Pat,

59:09.847 --> 59:12.814
and their two daughters,
Linnea and Tina.

59:12.816 --> 59:15.984
I think Pat's mother Delyth
is staying there, too.

59:15.986 --> 59:18.220
She usually does
over the holidays.

59:19.223 --> 59:22.024
I have to ask this
question, Mr. Anderson,

59:22.026 --> 59:25.193
but um, do you have a positive
relationship with the family?

59:25.195 --> 59:26.261
Absolutely.

59:26.263 --> 59:30.332
I know what you're thinking,
that they're hiding from me?

59:30.334 --> 59:33.218
But that's not their style.

59:33.219 --> 59:36.103
They're not really ones for
practical jokes, either.

59:38.676 --> 59:41.743
- Okay.
- I'm hoping it's nothing,

59:41.745 --> 59:44.913
but when I was
there, I don't know.

59:45.849 --> 59:49.184
It just felt like
something was wrong.

59:50.988 --> 59:54.323
Okay, well, Deputy Wilkes
and I'll take a drive

59:54.325 --> 59:59.227
up there soon, and we'll
take it from there, okay?

59:59.229 --> 01:00:00.929
Yeah, I appreciate that.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:30.626
It's just us here,

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:32.694
it's just you and me,
no one else, okay?

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:35.697
Shut the fuck up.

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:47.769
Come on, come on, come on.

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:50.238
Station,
what's your emergency?

01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:02.484
Which one of you keeps a diary?

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:05.487
I do.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:15.097
This chapter's juicy.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:20.469
I sat in Todd's car
with him tonight.

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:23.438
I look forward to it all day,

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.510
but when it actually
happened, I was so nervous.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:34.416
As we kissed I began
to feel excited,

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:38.920
and then he slipped
his hand in my skirt,

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:45.427
and I felt anxious initially
but then eased into it.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:49.331
He is very good with his hands.

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:52.934
I got so wet with his touch.

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.837
I told you, she's a little slut.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.774
Leave her alone!

01:03:02.513 --> 01:03:06.782
You, you've been testing my
patience all fucking day.

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:10.318
There's something
you should know.

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:14.523
I ain't keeping you alive
'cause I need a hostage.

01:03:14.525 --> 01:03:17.125
I could kill you right now,

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:19.961
and it wouldn't
mean a thing to me.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.399
Truth is this.

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:29.471
I want a sample of
what you're sellin'.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:33.108
I've been in prison a while,

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:36.578
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna
pass on that piece of ass.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.547
I'd rather die than
let you near me.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:40.415
You're fucking repulsive.

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:45.420
And believe it or not,
it gets my dick hard.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:51.827
The more you resist,
the better it gets.

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:07.342
<i> Come in</i>
<i>Sheriff, come in.</i>

01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:11.213
Yeah, come in dispatch,
this is Redwood.

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:13.215
<i>We've had
an emergency call</i>

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:14.583
<i>from a Richard Anderson.</i>

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:18.453
Yeah, what was the
nature of the call?

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:19.453
<i>He said intruders
broke into his cabin,</i>

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:21.556
<i>him, his wife,
and mother in law.</i>

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:23.558
<i>He's severely injured.</i>

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.062
<i>Said the two intruders are
male, still inside the cabin,</i>

01:04:27.064 --> 01:04:28.496
<i>holding his daughters hostage.</i>

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:30.098
All right, dispatch.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.467
Put a call out to all units.

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:36.071
Tell 'em to go to the Anderson
residence at Oak Grove.

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:39.007
Tell 'em Wilkes and I will be
there when they arrive, over.

01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:41.276
<i>Received Sheriff, over.</i>

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:42.510
It's gotta be
those two convicts.

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:44.579
Looks to be that way, yeah.

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.014
Should we wait for backup?

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:47.182
We can't afford to wait.

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:48.316
Just a few minutes
could be the difference

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:49.484
between life and death.

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:51.319
Remember those
ones that got away?

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:53.355
I'm not adding these
guys to the list.

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:06.534
Get up, get up!

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:11.339
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.645
Now, we can have a
little fun, okay?

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:22.651
First, I think we need to
up the stakes a bit, yeah?

01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:29.557
Ed, around the side of the
cabin is a can of gasoline,

01:05:29.559 --> 01:05:30.659
go get it.

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:33.028
What the fuck
do you want that for?

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:35.196
Just fuckin' go get it.

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.566
As a guy who went
to prison for arson,

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:41.503
I guarantee you're gonna
love what I got planned.

01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:47.242
Fuckin' still here?

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:49.244
Go fucking get it!

01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:51.947
Don't fuck with me.

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.520
Sorry about him.

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:03.358
Should we get comfortable?

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:08.997
Yeah.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:23.738
You wanna
fuck with me, huh?

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:29.744
Shut the fuck up, both of you!

01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:42.824
Sheriff's department!

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:45.126
Put your hands on your head
and turn around slowly!

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:54.202
I said put your hands on
your fuckin' head now.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:00.675
Don't do it.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.081
Don't do it, don't do it!

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:31.439
Mr. Anderson.

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:35.577
Don't worry about me.

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:40.814
My girls, Linnea and Tina,
they're upstairs, go help them.

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:50.792
Shh.

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:57.799
Now you fuckin' did it!

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.368
What the fuck is that?

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.477
Ah, shit.

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:12.212
We'll assign you the shittiest

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:13.680
ambulance-chasing motherfucker

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:16.417
you've ever seen to escort
you to the gas chamber, bitch.

01:09:17.888 --> 01:09:20.321
Fuck.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:21.788
Shit.

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:31.899
Jesus fuck!

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.207
How does it feel, huh?

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:40.875
Having a gun pointed at you?

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.377
You son of a bitch.

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:45.846
So this is what makes
you feel powerful.

01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:48.883
This is what makes
you feel like a man.

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:52.886
Just fucking kill me,

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:55.857
'cause I ain't goin' back
to the joint all right?

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:57.659
Kill you?

01:09:58.461 --> 01:09:59.494
Maybe I will.

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:03.331
But first, I want you
to understand one thing.

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:08.403
I refuse to be a victim.

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:11.940
You've done all you can
today to beat me down

01:10:11.942 --> 01:10:14.442
and make me feel like
I'm nothing.

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:18.413
You've robbed me of
the people I love.

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.650
Now you have a choice to make.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:26.888
Instant death, or live
without your balls.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.926
You haven't got
the fucking guts.

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:34.862
If you don't make a decision,

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:36.798
I'm gonna have to
make it for you.

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:42.904
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:46.374
Catch a bastard by the toe.

01:10:46.376 --> 01:10:49.877
If he don't holler, let him go.

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:51.946
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:00.688
Put the gun down.

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:01.990
This piece of shit
isn't getting off that easy.

01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:03.558
I said
put the gun down.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.593
He has to pay for what he did.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:06.828
He will.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.463
He'll spend the rest
of his life in prison.

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:09.897
Is that justice?

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:11.749
His life will be
one of confinement,

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:13.600
worrying every day if
he's gonna get attacked

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:14.969
by society's worst people.

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:19.374
If you kill him now, his
suffering will be over,

01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:21.709
and he won't have to
live with what he's done.

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:24.646
So put the gun down.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.550
It's okay, Linn.

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:30.451
It's okay.

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:34.722
It's okay, it's over.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.600
You have the
right to remain silent.

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:46.801
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:47.769
- Anything you say can and--
- Fuck!

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:00.641
Sheriff.

01:13:01.111 --> 01:13:02.543
You gotta see this.

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:17.570
What is this?

01:13:17.571 --> 01:13:19.316
It's a tape we got

01:13:19.317 --> 01:13:21.062
out of a home movie camera
in the cabin with the family.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:23.131
I was expecting to see
normal family stuff on it,

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:25.800
but you gotta check this out.

01:13:28.138 --> 01:13:31.472
- Recording, yeah?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:34.776
Yeah, yeah, go, go.

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:36.544
All right.

01:13:38.148 --> 01:13:39.414
What do we got there?

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:42.083
Linnea.

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:56.164
Oh man.

01:13:57.167 --> 01:13:58.599
This is like.

01:13:59.636 --> 01:14:00.701
What the fuck is that?

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:05.673
- Fucking--
- Are you kidding me?

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:06.908
<i> What the fuck.</i>

01:14:07.744 --> 01:14:10.178
<i> Stupid gloves or somethin'.</i>

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:14.215
<i>Like, pretty knock</i>
<i>out socks.</i>

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:16.851
- Piece of shit.
- We're terrible.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.721
Still on me, yeah?

01:14:20.723 --> 01:14:21.989
Yeah yeah, it's on you.

01:14:32.202 --> 01:14:33.868
The fuck is this?

01:14:35.605 --> 01:14:36.537
Boots?

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:37.839
They got a foot fetish?

01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:41.943
<i>It's all fucking feet.</i>

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:45.480
<i>Fuckin' book.</i>

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:47.982
<i>Who wants a fuckin'
book for Christmas?</i>

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.588
To Dad, love me.

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:57.692
How's he supposed to
know who me is, huh?

01:14:58.995 --> 01:14:59.894
Idiot.

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:07.835
Oh, Daddy gets a mug, huh?

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:10.671
Yeah, real original.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.106
Jesus.

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:16.744
You look uglier on this
than you do in real life.

01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:19.580
You fucking kidding me?

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:21.516
No, man.

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:22.683
Fuck you, you piece of shit.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:27.021
You're fuckin' ugly,
just lookin' at you.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:37.058
God, it doesn't
feel like 10 years.

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.227
No, it feels like
only yesterday.

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:45.199
We gonna go in, or?

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:48.603
Yeah, that's why we're here.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:52.106
Come on.

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:26.707
It's still too painful.

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:27.875
I know it is.

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:36.350
It's about feeling pain and
being able to deal with it

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:37.284
in a healthy way.

01:17:56.939 --> 01:17:59.173
I feel like they took
my sense of security.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:02.810
I can't even walk a
block to my car at night

01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:04.445
without being on edge.

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:12.386
But it's made me protective
over those I love,

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:13.821
even the people I don't know.

01:18:13.823 --> 01:18:15.456
You know, I'm the first
to walk up to a girl

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.425
and ask if that
guy's bothering her.

01:18:24.434 --> 01:18:27.301
I guess it's, it's
given me strength

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:28.769
to stand up for myself.

01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:31.405
Same for me, I guess.

01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:36.811
Just being able to be back here
shows us how far we've come.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:43.117
You know I was so angry for
years after what happened.

01:18:44.821 --> 01:18:47.488
I just couldn't acknowledge
my real feelings

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:49.256
because they were too painful.

01:18:53.996 --> 01:18:55.429
One thing I learned
through all of this

01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:58.432
is that none of
is was our fault.

01:18:58.434 --> 01:18:59.867
We can never blame ourselves.

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:02.103
I know, yeah, it took me

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:04.472
a really long time
to accept that.

01:19:04.474 --> 01:19:07.341
Even now, I have to
remind myself sometimes.

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:19.820
I still regret not having the
best relationship with Mom.

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:24.959
You know she adored
you though, right?

01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:27.962
Of course, yeah I loved
her, too, I still do.

01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:32.433
But since she's--

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.925
It's weird.

01:19:40.926 --> 01:19:43.043
I almost feel closer to her now.

01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:49.116
I find myself saying
things to the kids

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.986
that Mom would've
said to me, it's like.

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:56.290
It's like she's still with me.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.300
God, we've been through a lot.

01:20:08.271 --> 01:20:09.170
Yeah.

01:20:13.543 --> 01:20:14.475
But we're still here.
