00:54.567 --> 00:59.532
Your Honor, Mr. Lock, he
set his TV show in Chicago.

00:59.533 --> 01:01.289
He could've set it anywhere.

01:01.292 --> 01:03.430
New York, New Orleans.

01:03.433 --> 01:05.872
Anywhere, but he chose Chicago,

01:05.875 --> 01:09.232
and he was promised a 30% tax break...

01:09.233 --> 01:11.192
But only if he used
post-production facilities

01:11.195 --> 01:12.299
in Illinois.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.106
Mr. Lock only moved his
post-production facilities

01:15.109 --> 01:17.637
to Los Angeles for reasons of diversity.

01:17.640 --> 01:18.599
Oh, come on.

01:18.600 --> 01:23.101
Uh, maybe the City of Chicago
cares less about diversity

01:23.104 --> 01:24.699
than Marshall Lock.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.481
His Los Angeles facilities

01:26.484 --> 01:28.666
are majority African-American owned,

01:28.667 --> 01:33.007
and that is far better...

01:33.010 --> 01:34.376
Damn it.

01:34.379 --> 01:36.144
She has to go to the
bathroom, doesn't she?

01:36.147 --> 01:38.313
That is far better

01:38.316 --> 01:42.231
than the all-white
facilities in Chicago!

01:42.234 --> 01:44.500
She is very good.

01:44.503 --> 01:46.402
Do you need a moment, Counselor?

01:46.405 --> 01:49.864
Uh, I don't know what you m-mean.

01:49.867 --> 01:51.666
Yes. Yes!

01:51.667 --> 01:53.499
Recess! Fuck!

01:53.500 --> 01:55.199
Fuck!

01:55.200 --> 01:56.766
Recess, yes...

01:58.233 --> 01:59.499
Damn it.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.499
Two weeks early?

02:01.500 --> 02:04.366
I have the-the Muncer case in pretrial,

02:04.367 --> 02:06.590
and I have the Violence
Prevention Committee.

02:06.593 --> 02:08.499
No. Shut up, okay? You are giving birth.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.879
You need to stop talking
about work and focus. Okay?

02:11.882 --> 02:14.036
- Who are you calling?
- Your OBGYN.

02:14.039 --> 02:15.200
How do you have his number?

02:15.203 --> 02:16.199
This is your phone.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.039
Oh, shit, no, no, no.

02:18.042 --> 02:19.766
- What?
- He's in Mendocino.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.733
What?

02:21.734 --> 02:24.265
Call Colin.

02:35.533 --> 02:36.825
Morrello residence.

02:36.828 --> 02:38.132
Down with Trump.

02:38.135 --> 02:40.417
I need to speak to Colin Morrello.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.043
He's not in right now.

02:42.046 --> 02:44.187
- And I'm a little busy.
- What? No, no, no.

02:44.190 --> 02:46.103
I am calling for Lucca Quinn.

02:46.106 --> 02:48.296
- She's giving birth.
- Excuse me?

02:48.299 --> 02:50.664
Lucca Quinn is giving birth.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.366
Oh, my God.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.067
I have it in my calendar.

02:54.070 --> 02:55.366
It's two weeks from now.

02:55.367 --> 02:56.933
I thought we agreed she was inducing.

02:56.934 --> 02:58.432
- Is that Francesca?
- Yes.

02:58.433 --> 02:59.809
Tell her to get Colin.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.848
Okay, Lucca wants you to call Colin.

03:01.851 --> 03:03.145
Tell her I'm coming right now.

03:03.148 --> 03:05.532
And Colin is in D.C. until next week.

03:05.533 --> 03:08.733
Helga, help me, I'm
gonna be a grandmother.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.632
Bitch. She hung up.

03:10.633 --> 03:12.332
What?

03:12.333 --> 03:14.017
Call Diane. Diane?

03:14.020 --> 03:15.278
- Tell Diane...
- Okay.

03:15.281 --> 03:20.107
...that I will be unable
to make the Violence...

03:20.110 --> 03:21.473
- The Violence Committee.
- Oh!

03:21.476 --> 03:23.051
- Okay.
- Jesus!

03:23.054 --> 03:25.562
- I thought it was in two weeks.
- Uh-huh.

03:25.565 --> 03:28.263
Well, we all did, but it looks
like the baby didn't agree.

03:28.266 --> 03:30.598
Yeah, don't-don't worry about
it, just keep us in touch.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.332
- What's wrong?
- Lucca is in labor.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.231
What? When did this happen?

03:34.234 --> 03:36.666
Just now. Maia called on
her way to the hospital.

03:36.667 --> 03:39.468
Listen, can you take Lucca's
place on the Violence Committee?

03:39.471 --> 03:41.004
No, I have to get to the hospital.

03:41.007 --> 03:42.648
Not you, she means me.

03:42.651 --> 03:44.098
Yeah, I'll head right over there.

03:45.633 --> 03:47.165
Sorry to keep you waiting.

03:47.166 --> 03:49.148
Oh, no problem, you
seem very busy out there.

03:49.151 --> 03:51.215
Ah, just the unexpected.

03:51.218 --> 03:53.215
Are you all right?

03:53.218 --> 03:54.933
Uh, yeah. Yes, I'm fine.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.899
One of our lawyers is,
uh, going into labor.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.153
Oh, my God. Oh, no, not her.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.933
Her, uh, her best friend.

04:02.934 --> 04:05.694
So two female FBI agents?

04:05.697 --> 04:06.856
Is that unusual?

04:06.859 --> 04:08.671
Uh, no, not these days.

04:08.674 --> 04:09.973
So you want to hear me

04:09.976 --> 04:11.566
say terrible things about my husband?

04:12.948 --> 04:14.529
No, it's just a
standard background check

04:14.531 --> 04:16.428
for anybody applying to the FBI.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.497
It's pretty routine, painless.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.781
Well, good. Fire away.

04:20.784 --> 04:23.165
Do you know Mr. McVeigh
to be an honest person?

04:23.166 --> 04:26.299
I do. He is the most
honest person I know.

04:26.302 --> 04:27.864
And during the course of your marriage,

04:27.867 --> 04:30.432
have you and Mr. McVeigh
maintained the same residence?

04:30.433 --> 04:34.293
No. He is a country
person, and I'm city,

04:34.296 --> 04:35.981
so we have lived apart,

04:35.984 --> 04:38.507
but we moved in together
permanently last week.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.412
And in the last six months,
has anyone else stayed

04:40.414 --> 04:42.289
- at your residence?
- Uh, no.

04:42.292 --> 04:45.697
A friend's daughter came when
she was visiting colleges.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.299
And my goddaughter, Maia Rindell,

04:48.300 --> 04:49.466
spent a few days.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.445
- Maia Rindell?
- Yes.

04:51.448 --> 04:53.382
Henry's daughter. She stayed with me

04:53.385 --> 04:55.171
during the scandal.

04:55.174 --> 04:57.799
- I hope that's not a problem.
- It shouldn't be.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.466
You think of anything
else, just give us a call.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.731
Oh, and that's all?

05:01.734 --> 05:04.379
Yes. Like we said, painless.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.699
Hey.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.750
Is Lucca really giving birth?

05:30.753 --> 05:32.614
Yes, I just got the call.

05:32.617 --> 05:34.566
Uh, listen, do you have a minute?

05:34.567 --> 05:36.833
Something wrong?

05:36.834 --> 05:38.632
Uh, maybe.

05:38.633 --> 05:42.692
Uh, Kurt was offered a
ballistics job by the FBI...

05:42.695 --> 05:46.247
- Ooh.
- ...and I was, uh, just interviewed

05:46.250 --> 05:50.457
by two agents as part of a
standard background check,

05:50.460 --> 05:53.731
and I'm worried about one of my answers.

05:53.734 --> 05:56.232
Okay. Which one?

05:56.233 --> 05:58.367
Um, can I borrow a dollar?

06:07.953 --> 06:09.695
I need a consultation.

06:09.698 --> 06:10.864
I am now your lawyer.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.520
The two FBI agents asked me

06:13.523 --> 06:16.457
if anyone had, uh,
stayed at my residence.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.430
And I answered a friend and Maia.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.666
Are you worried about the scandal?

06:21.667 --> 06:25.099
No, someone else stayed there, too.

06:25.100 --> 06:28.099
A man, overnight.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.270
No, that's why

06:30.273 --> 06:32.532
we left our card, Ms.
Lockhart, thank you for calling.

06:32.533 --> 06:33.926
So who else stayed with you?

06:33.929 --> 06:34.933
I, um...

06:34.934 --> 06:36.731
I had a party last year

06:36.734 --> 06:39.895
with a dozen friends and, uh, coworkers.

06:39.898 --> 06:41.231
And they stayed the night?

06:41.234 --> 06:43.532
No, I just thought I'd mention them.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.699
And, um, a neighbor of
mine had water damage,

06:46.700 --> 06:48.499
and I let her stay at my apartment

06:48.500 --> 06:49.766
while I was out of town.

06:49.767 --> 06:51.207
Uh, Julie Rayborn.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.566
"Rayborn."

06:52.567 --> 06:54.832
Oh, and, uh, and a friend of mine,

06:54.833 --> 06:57.106
um, stayed one night.

06:57.109 --> 06:58.799
Um, Tully Nelson.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.099
Okay, um, has Mr. McVeigh

07:01.100 --> 07:03.273
met either Ms. Rayborn or Mr. Nelson?

07:03.276 --> 07:05.542
Uh, no, not to my knowledge.

07:05.545 --> 07:07.411
Well, thanks for
clarifying. Uh, we should be

07:07.414 --> 07:08.866
finished with our work today.

07:08.867 --> 07:11.085
No problem. Bye.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.833
You're fine.

07:20.109 --> 07:21.799
"Kill all lawyers."

07:21.800 --> 07:23.856
That's been the anthem for six months

07:23.859 --> 07:25.866
of copycat killers and assaulters.

07:25.869 --> 07:27.950
Well, today that ends.

07:27.953 --> 07:29.732
That's great to hear, Warren.

07:29.733 --> 07:32.566
Three inches to the left, I'd be dead.

07:32.567 --> 07:34.899
I know, my God. Uh,
that's one of the reasons

07:34.900 --> 07:36.799
Rahm wanted you on this committee.

07:36.802 --> 07:38.356
And it's good to see you too, Julius.

07:38.359 --> 07:39.695
Ha, thank you.

07:39.698 --> 07:41.798
The mayor has gathered
together the best people:

07:41.800 --> 07:44.965
Republicans and Democrats, a-a judge,

07:44.968 --> 07:47.233
a journalist, a drama teacher,

07:47.236 --> 07:49.402
all to decide how to spend $10 million,

07:49.405 --> 07:51.864
and finally address this
problem of lawyer killings.

07:51.867 --> 07:54.133
- Warren.
- Yeah?

07:54.134 --> 07:55.933
With no oversight?

07:55.934 --> 07:59.020
None. Rahm believes you put the
best people in a room together,

07:59.023 --> 08:00.895
and let them do their thing.

08:00.898 --> 08:04.858
So don't be intimidated by the
other powerhouses in this room.

08:04.861 --> 08:07.411
You've had experience being a victim.

08:07.414 --> 08:10.093
Share it. Use it.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.599
Gentlemen, I think some of you know

08:14.600 --> 08:16.692
Adrian and Julius from Reddick/Boseman.

08:16.695 --> 08:17.832
And I think you know

08:17.833 --> 08:20.882
His Honor, Trig Mullaney,
a recent Trump appointee.

08:20.885 --> 08:23.365
And Ted Willoughby from the
Fox show, Ted and Friends?

08:23.366 --> 08:24.866
Howdy. A fellow pundit.

08:24.867 --> 08:26.933
And beloved drama teacher,

08:26.934 --> 08:31.145
the top educator of 2018,
Neil Howard Sloan-Jacob.

08:31.148 --> 08:33.261
♪ Good morning, good morning ♪

08:33.265 --> 08:35.879
♪ To you and you and you. ♪

08:35.881 --> 08:39.066
Anyway, I will let you all get to it.

08:39.067 --> 08:40.756
Uh...

08:43.046 --> 08:44.566
Warren. Warren.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.365
Yeah.

08:46.366 --> 08:49.432
Um...

08:49.433 --> 08:51.090
These are the powerhouses?

08:51.093 --> 08:52.866
- Yes, why?
- You don't think

08:52.869 --> 08:54.106
they're lacking?

08:54.109 --> 08:56.520
Adrian, that's a federal judge,

08:56.523 --> 08:59.909
a top TV journalist and
an award-winning educator.

08:59.912 --> 09:02.911
- Oh, look, if this is about partisanship...
- No. No, no.

09:02.914 --> 09:05.732
You get me a smart
Republican, I'd be thrilled.

09:05.733 --> 09:07.365
Warren.

09:07.366 --> 09:08.432
I know these three.

09:08.433 --> 09:11.499
They are functioning idiots.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.571
Wow.

09:13.574 --> 09:16.840
I never thought of you
as an elitist, Adrian.

09:16.843 --> 09:19.465
- Come on, man, I...
- But, you know,

09:19.466 --> 09:24.099
if they are functioning idiots,
it should make your job easier.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.365
Convince them.

09:25.366 --> 09:26.804
All you need is a majority.

09:26.807 --> 09:28.176
Three votes to two.

09:28.179 --> 09:30.532
You've got this.

09:34.349 --> 09:35.867
Lucca Quinn? Lucca Quinn.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.404
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- Oh, my God.

09:37.406 --> 09:40.938
Ma'am. Miss?

09:40.941 --> 09:42.140
Excuse me.

09:42.143 --> 09:43.664
Hi, um, my friend is giving birth.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.204
- Lucca Quinn, you know where...
- She's right there.

09:45.206 --> 09:46.772
- Okay.
- ...calming music.

09:46.775 --> 09:48.630
Jesus, God, where is the epidural?

09:48.633 --> 09:50.140
I got him, I got Colin.

09:50.143 --> 09:51.771
How's he doing in D.C.?

09:51.774 --> 09:53.105
Don't you dare take that.

09:53.108 --> 09:54.408
All right.

09:54.411 --> 09:57.643
Can you show Marissa how to use a door?

09:57.646 --> 10:00.039
Hello, Colin? Where are you?

10:00.042 --> 10:01.809
I'm headed to the airport,
what do you think...

10:01.811 --> 10:04.117
Sir, sir, could you go around, please?

10:04.120 --> 10:05.843
This lane is not moving, sir.

10:05.846 --> 10:08.015
- Fuck!
- I'm out of town for 18 hours,

10:08.018 --> 10:10.008
and that's when you choose to
go into motherfucking labor?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.076
God, it's good to hear

10:11.079 --> 10:13.094
- someone swear other than me.
- This lane is moving.

10:13.096 --> 10:14.700
Why would we be in
this lane? It makes...

10:14.703 --> 10:17.766
Fucking hell!

10:17.767 --> 10:19.515
Cocksucker!

10:21.934 --> 10:25.187
Motherfucking cocksucker!

10:25.190 --> 10:27.109
Fucking asshole!

10:27.112 --> 10:29.428
Fucker! Fuck! Fucking,
fucking cock sucking...

10:29.431 --> 10:31.330
- Fuck!
- ...ass licking, ball fondler!

10:36.767 --> 10:39.799
Thank you for letting us
come to you, Mr. McVeigh.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.320
Ballistics asked to expedite
your background check.

10:42.323 --> 10:44.556
They want to put you to work fast.

10:44.559 --> 10:46.764
- So here we are.
- No problem.

10:46.767 --> 10:48.929
- Do you know Maia Rindell?
- Yes.

10:48.932 --> 10:50.239
Did you have any investment

10:50.241 --> 10:51.741
in the Rindell Fund?

10:51.744 --> 10:54.781
No, but I probably benefited
through community property.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.383
Understood.

10:56.386 --> 10:58.289
Do you know Julie Rayborn?

10:58.292 --> 11:00.125
- No.
- She's a neighbor

11:00.128 --> 11:02.127
who stayed overnight here.

11:02.130 --> 11:05.096
Do you know Tully Nelson?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.531
Yes.

11:06.534 --> 11:08.399
Did you have any contact with him

11:08.402 --> 11:10.068
when he stayed here overnight?

11:11.700 --> 11:13.257
No.

11:13.260 --> 11:16.375
Do you know when he stayed here?

11:16.378 --> 11:17.909
No.

11:17.912 --> 11:21.512
Was it more than one night?

11:21.515 --> 11:24.514
I don't know.

11:24.517 --> 11:28.099
Does this apartment have
more than one bedroom?

11:28.100 --> 11:30.300
No.

12:02.242 --> 12:05.335
"Conspiracy carries a life sentence.

12:05.338 --> 12:07.445
If you want my help, leave a flower pot

12:07.448 --> 12:09.312
in your office window and I'll meet you

12:09.315 --> 12:12.530
at your parking space."

12:12.533 --> 12:14.015
You don't know who gave you this?

12:14.018 --> 12:16.184
No.

12:16.187 --> 12:17.886
Conspiracy to what?

12:17.889 --> 12:20.221
I don't know.

12:20.224 --> 12:22.164
This is sort of crazy.

12:22.167 --> 12:26.357
It's-it's like someone's
trying to make you paranoid.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.554
It has to be somebody
who can see my window.

12:29.557 --> 12:31.856
Well, if it's not a prank.

12:31.859 --> 12:36.397
We're too high up for anybody
to see us from the street.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.799
Have you ever noticed two
people in the window there,

12:39.800 --> 12:41.747
the two windows at the end?

12:41.750 --> 12:43.832
They wear Trump masks.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.566
What?

12:46.567 --> 12:52.099
They dance, and h-have
sex wearing Trump masks.

12:52.100 --> 12:55.133
Are you sure?

12:55.134 --> 12:56.656
No. I think that's

12:56.659 --> 12:59.408
an insurance firm.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.976
Diane Lockhart.

13:09.466 --> 13:11.465
Um...

13:11.466 --> 13:13.765
Can you, um, can you ask me that again?

13:13.768 --> 13:15.367
Yes, we were wondering

13:15.370 --> 13:17.603
if you can drop by
here in an hour or so.

13:17.606 --> 13:19.296
We have just one more question.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.140
Um, sure. Can you ask me on the phone?

13:22.143 --> 13:24.523
Unfortunately, it's
probably better in person.

13:24.526 --> 13:26.320
We can arrange it at your convenience.

13:26.323 --> 13:28.522
I'll go as your lawyer.

13:28.525 --> 13:31.195
Um, sure. When do you want me?

13:34.371 --> 13:35.471
Thank you so much

13:35.474 --> 13:36.875
for coming in, Diane.

13:36.878 --> 13:39.296
Certainly. You're welcome.

13:39.299 --> 13:41.132
This is Liz Reddick, my lawyer.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.033
Hi.

13:44.034 --> 13:45.799
You don't need a lawyer.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.820
This isn't meant to be adversarial.

13:47.823 --> 13:50.343
Good. Then we should be fast.

13:50.346 --> 13:52.512
We really only have one
question for you, Diane.

13:52.515 --> 13:54.796
It's something that came up
during our background check.

13:54.799 --> 13:57.890
This friend who stayed in
your apartment, Tully Nelson?

13:57.893 --> 14:00.427
We've discovered he's made
threats against the president.

14:02.364 --> 14:03.968
Uh, what threats?

14:03.971 --> 14:06.204
He's threatened the president's life.

14:06.207 --> 14:09.492
We know you didn't have
anything to do with that, Diane,

14:09.495 --> 14:11.921
but we wanted to give you a
chance to give us your take.

14:11.924 --> 14:14.437
Uh, excuse me, uh, let me
just interrupt for a sec.

14:14.440 --> 14:18.064
Is this a background check of
Kurt McVeigh, or Diane Lockhart?

14:18.067 --> 14:19.766
Mr. McVeigh's wife

14:19.767 --> 14:21.679
slept with a man who
threatened the president,

14:21.682 --> 14:24.113
she then invited that
man back to her apartment,

14:24.116 --> 14:26.816
the apartment she
shares with her husband.

14:26.819 --> 14:29.618
That impacts Mr.
McVeigh's background check.

14:29.621 --> 14:33.054
Well, I'm glad this isn't adversarial.

14:34.567 --> 14:36.767
Where are you getting your information?

14:41.209 --> 14:43.931
Okay, well, you can submit
your questions in writing

14:43.934 --> 14:46.666
and we will take a look at
them. Thank you so very much.

14:46.667 --> 14:49.007
This is a subpoena, Ms. Lockhart.

14:49.010 --> 14:50.578
Are you fucking kidding me?

14:50.581 --> 14:52.867
We'll need you to testify
at a grand jury hearing today

14:52.870 --> 14:54.269
against Tully Nelson.

14:54.272 --> 14:56.033
Just a background check, huh?

14:58.627 --> 15:01.192
We now know conspiracy to what.

15:01.195 --> 15:04.127
Assassination.

15:04.130 --> 15:05.593
That carries a life sentence.

15:05.596 --> 15:07.812
Let's not talk here.

16:48.140 --> 16:52.637
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

17:09.548 --> 17:12.839
We have an opportunity
here to stop these killings.

17:12.843 --> 17:14.421
The key is to be smart.

17:14.424 --> 17:15.824
I have a proposal.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.319
Can I just say first, I
think we're overreacting.

17:19.323 --> 17:23.363
There are more people killed
by killer bees each year

17:23.366 --> 17:24.699
- than by gunfire.
- What? What?

17:24.700 --> 17:26.664
- What?
- I know. I was surprised, too.

17:26.666 --> 17:31.161
A Global News study showed
that only 3,000 people

17:31.164 --> 17:32.179
were killed by gunfire...

17:32.182 --> 17:33.883
- Now, that is not true. That is not true.
- It's scary

17:33.885 --> 17:36.305
how many of these things you see
on the Internet that are faked.

17:36.307 --> 17:37.975
You know, even, uh,
the lawyer hit-and-run.

17:37.977 --> 17:39.618
- That was done in a studio.
- No, it wasn't.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.340
Roger Hill was killed by a car.

17:41.343 --> 17:43.066
Yeah, can I just say something here?

17:43.067 --> 17:44.500
Guns are not the answer.

17:44.503 --> 17:47.403
I mean, last year, we
did Annie Get Your Gun

17:47.406 --> 17:50.872
for the spring musical and we
replaced any reference to gun

17:50.875 --> 17:52.674
with puppies.

17:52.677 --> 17:54.877
And it worked just as
well, maybe even better.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.047
Two curtain calls.

17:58.179 --> 18:03.045
I just don't think you
need guns to have drama.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.914
I agree.

18:06.983 --> 18:10.615
Last six months, three
lawyers shot by gunfire.

18:10.618 --> 18:13.917
All those guns have been
used in previous crimes.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.786
All those guns would've been subject

18:16.789 --> 18:19.532
to an illegal gun buyback program.

18:19.533 --> 18:23.340
My proposal, we use the $10 million

18:23.343 --> 18:26.382
to buy back illegal guns.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.299
So we pay the criminals?

18:32.300 --> 18:35.617
No. We buy back the illegal guns.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.297
Why don't we use the money
for a great ad campaign?

18:38.300 --> 18:40.599
"I heart lawyers," you know?

18:40.600 --> 18:42.366
- Something like that.
- That's fun.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.700
With big, smiling photos of lawyers

18:44.703 --> 18:46.532
on billboards and a jingle.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.866
Ooh, uh... ♪ I love lawyers ♪

18:48.867 --> 18:50.566

what rhymes with that?

18:52.533 --> 18:53.833

18:55.567 --> 18:57.067

18:58.633 --> 19:00.366

- See, see,

19:00.367 --> 19:02.575
I like that. It's not
negative like a buyback.

19:02.578 --> 19:04.599
No, it's not. It's
better. Truth, liberty...

19:04.600 --> 19:07.335
These clowns are gonna outvote us.

19:07.338 --> 19:10.125
Yeah. We need to get to him.

19:10.128 --> 19:12.039
I'll meet you at the bar association.

19:12.042 --> 19:13.641
That's good.

19:13.644 --> 19:14.843
That's fun, right?

19:17.479 --> 19:19.750
Okay, good. I'll see you in ten.

19:19.753 --> 19:21.549
Okay. Bye.

19:21.552 --> 19:23.156
- Thanks.
- Who was that?

19:23.159 --> 19:25.765
- My mom. She's on her way.
- Your mom.

19:25.768 --> 19:27.812
- Aw, she's here.
- Yes.

19:27.815 --> 19:30.062
In town to help. Glory be.

19:30.065 --> 19:32.664
Can someone turn off
that fucking music?!

19:32.667 --> 19:35.506
I can't wait to meet her. We'll
have so much to talk about.

19:35.509 --> 19:37.664
Aah! God!

19:37.667 --> 19:39.433
Okay. Breathe. Just breathe.

19:39.436 --> 19:41.187
You can do this. Think
of something else.

19:41.190 --> 19:42.855
- Focus on something else.
- Like what?

19:42.858 --> 19:44.890
- Are you leaving?
- Am I what?

19:44.893 --> 19:47.398
Francesca says you're leaving,
that you're moving to D.C.

19:47.401 --> 19:48.938
- What?!
- Mm-hmm. She was offered

19:48.941 --> 19:50.921
a job by Obama's people.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.149
Isn't that wonderful?

19:52.152 --> 19:54.359
It's organizing for... wait, what is it?

19:54.362 --> 19:57.109
Action. I'm-I'm-I'm not sure I'm going.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.228
Well, yes you are. You
told Colin you were.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.140
No. I said I was considering it.

20:01.143 --> 20:02.408
When would you leave?

20:02.411 --> 20:03.671
I don't know.

20:03.674 --> 20:05.242
I-I don't know if I'm going.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.812
Mr. Habercore was very excited about it.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.615
Okay, can we deal with this later?!

20:34.953 --> 20:36.899
♪ Fuzzy, fuzzy, cute, cute ♪

20:36.900 --> 20:39.039
♪ Fuzzy, fuzzy, cute. ♪

20:48.907 --> 20:50.207
Were you followed?

20:50.210 --> 20:52.675
No. Are you sure?

20:52.678 --> 20:54.460
Yes.

20:54.463 --> 20:56.097
Who are you?

20:58.326 --> 20:59.858
Do you want my help?

20:59.861 --> 21:02.026
Do I need your help?

21:02.036 --> 21:05.902
They're out to put you
in prison, so you tell me.

21:05.905 --> 21:08.404
Who's "they"?

21:08.407 --> 21:10.732
You think all the
problems you've been having

21:10.733 --> 21:12.233
are accidental?

21:12.234 --> 21:13.799
Your investigator, now you.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.117
It's all connected.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.348
They know your firm's
leading the way on impeachment

21:17.351 --> 21:18.765
and the pee-pee tape.

21:18.766 --> 21:22.266
Trump's obsessed with the pee-pee tape.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.064
So, what do I call you?

21:31.067 --> 21:32.233
Deep Throat?

21:32.234 --> 21:34.665
No, I don't do deep throat.

21:34.666 --> 21:36.966
Just double penetration and girl-on-girl.

21:36.967 --> 21:39.601
You're a porn star?

21:39.604 --> 21:42.195
Former. I direct now.

21:42.198 --> 21:43.663
Oh, my God.

21:43.666 --> 21:45.932
Look, dismiss me if you want,

21:45.933 --> 21:48.366
but Trump doesn't give a
damn about men in suits.

21:48.367 --> 21:50.333
Mueller, Cohen, he
eats them for breakfast.

21:50.336 --> 21:52.032
He cares about me.

21:52.033 --> 21:54.966
He's terrified of me.

21:54.967 --> 21:56.460
It's high school.

21:56.463 --> 21:59.329
He's terrified of anyone
who's seen him in the nude.

21:59.332 --> 22:02.164
Okay, so why do you need me?

22:02.167 --> 22:05.333
Because I'm covered by a
nondisclosure agreement.

22:05.334 --> 22:06.733
You're not.

22:09.656 --> 22:11.865
So what do I need to do?

22:11.868 --> 22:15.266
Follow the women.

22:15.269 --> 22:16.869
I don't understand.

22:16.872 --> 22:18.337
You want to defend yourself,

22:18.340 --> 22:20.239
you need to find their weakness.

22:20.242 --> 22:21.692
It's the women,

22:21.695 --> 22:25.286
the affairs, the
prostitutes, the love child.

22:25.289 --> 22:27.695
Follow the women.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.367
My car's this way.

22:44.900 --> 22:49.066
A porn star told you
to "follow the women"?

22:49.067 --> 22:50.832
I know.

22:50.833 --> 22:52.899
I've spent the last six months in a haze

22:52.900 --> 22:55.333
of not knowing what was
crazy and what was not.

22:55.334 --> 22:56.789
I still don't know.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.625
Did this porn star tell
you why to follow the women?

23:03.367 --> 23:05.773
So we'd have something
to use against them.

23:05.776 --> 23:07.225
But he's not going after you.

23:07.228 --> 23:08.660
He's going after Tully Nelson.

23:08.663 --> 23:09.762
Lucca's at the hospital?

23:09.765 --> 23:11.231
Yes. Two weeks early.

23:11.234 --> 23:12.884
- Is she okay?
- So far.

23:12.887 --> 23:14.286
And you were served?

23:14.289 --> 23:17.699
By the same prosecutor
who went after you.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.166
What do you need?

23:19.167 --> 23:21.015
You were there for me; I'm here for you.

23:22.766 --> 23:25.866
There may be something
between him and a woman.

23:25.867 --> 23:28.866
Can you look into it?

23:28.867 --> 23:30.340
We're ready for you, Ms. Lockhart.

23:30.343 --> 23:32.402
Good. I think you know Mr. Dipersia.

23:32.405 --> 23:33.937
Yes. Hello.

23:35.733 --> 23:37.032
Diane.

23:37.033 --> 23:38.546
Hello, Tully.

23:38.549 --> 23:40.865
Are you testifying?

23:40.868 --> 23:42.266
Can we talk for a minute?

23:42.267 --> 23:45.732
Look, I'm so sorry about this.

23:45.733 --> 23:47.166
This is the new America.

23:47.167 --> 23:48.265
Fucking fascists.

23:48.268 --> 23:50.585
Listen, did you take the fifth?

23:50.588 --> 23:52.520
- No. I had nothing to be ashamed of.
- Tully.

23:52.523 --> 23:55.130
Look, we have to start
standing up to this bullshit,

23:55.133 --> 23:56.846
not hiding behind legal loopholes.

23:56.849 --> 23:58.082
Ms. Lockhart.

23:58.085 --> 23:59.364
All right, here's the thing.

23:59.367 --> 24:01.364
I waived attorney-client privilege.

24:01.367 --> 24:02.210
Oh, my God.

24:02.213 --> 24:04.864
Everything I said I am proud of.

24:04.867 --> 24:08.032
It's either a joke or I stand by it.

24:08.033 --> 24:09.833
Now go give them hell, gorgeous.

24:20.367 --> 24:23.032
Ms. Lockhart, hello.

24:23.033 --> 24:24.632
Hello, Mr. Basehart.

24:24.635 --> 24:28.097
We just have some questions
about your client, Tully Nelson.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.137
He's already waived his right
to attorney-client privilege.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.204
Yes.

24:32.207 --> 24:35.473
So you're obliged to answer
my questions, is that not so?

24:35.476 --> 24:37.765
Yes.

24:37.766 --> 24:41.098
Did Mr. Nelson on two occasions mention

24:41.101 --> 24:43.765
wanting to assassinate President Trump?

24:43.766 --> 24:45.299
Yes.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.926
He did? And did you not
think it was important

24:47.929 --> 24:51.598
to report these threats
to the authorities?

24:51.601 --> 24:53.899
- No.
- Why is that?

24:53.900 --> 24:57.032
Well, for the same reason
I didn't report Johnny Depp

24:57.033 --> 24:59.372
when he talked about
assassinating the president

24:59.375 --> 25:02.665
during the, um, film
festival in Glastonbury.

25:02.666 --> 25:04.382
It was a joke.

25:04.385 --> 25:06.366
And how did you know it was a joke?

25:06.367 --> 25:07.765
Because Johnny Depp said it was.

25:07.766 --> 25:09.333
No. Tully Nelson.

25:09.334 --> 25:10.992
Oh, for the same reason.

25:10.995 --> 25:14.364
I asked Tully if he was
joking and he said yes.

25:14.367 --> 25:17.732
Okay. That makes sense.

25:17.733 --> 25:20.293
Let me play a tape
for you, Ms. Lockhart.

25:20.296 --> 25:22.411
You up?

25:22.414 --> 25:24.166
Actually, yes.

25:24.167 --> 25:25.957
Why the Beretta?

25:25.960 --> 25:29.199
Ah, you know guns?

25:29.200 --> 25:32.032
This is not a gun. It's a pistol.

25:32.033 --> 25:33.366
And I know it's illegal

25:33.367 --> 25:36.286
to modify the Milsurp
magazine for a 92S.

25:36.289 --> 25:37.494
Where did you get that?

25:37.497 --> 25:39.430
That is a recording of
you, isn't it, Ms. Lockhart?

25:39.432 --> 25:41.484
That is an illegal recording

25:41.487 --> 25:43.864
of an attorney consulting
with her client.

25:43.867 --> 25:45.442
- In her bedroom?
- Excuse me,

25:45.445 --> 25:47.679
but the location of that
recording is not relevant.

25:47.682 --> 25:49.386
What is being discussed
here, Ms. Lockhart,

25:49.389 --> 25:51.230
is a conspiracy to
assassinate the president.

25:51.233 --> 25:52.465
That's why we have a warrant.

25:52.468 --> 25:53.966
It was a joke.

25:53.967 --> 25:55.732
And you have no right to use that.

25:55.735 --> 25:58.957
If it was a joke, then why this?

25:58.960 --> 26:00.912
You are discussing a
crime with your lawyer.

26:00.914 --> 26:03.379
No, no, no. I am discussing politics.

26:03.382 --> 26:04.932
Violence is not politics.

26:04.933 --> 26:06.366
Oh, really?

26:08.329 --> 26:09.895
Isn't that the sound

26:09.898 --> 26:13.132
of you removing bullets
from Mr. Nelson's magazine?

26:13.133 --> 26:16.450
And if you truly thought he was joking,

26:16.453 --> 26:18.906
then why would you remove his bullets?

26:34.095 --> 26:35.960
- You taped us?
- No, I...

26:35.963 --> 26:37.430
You taped our conversation?

26:37.433 --> 26:38.598
No, I-I didn't.

26:38.601 --> 26:40.023
They have us talking.

26:40.026 --> 26:42.520
They have our
conversation in my bedroom.

26:42.523 --> 26:43.950
No, it wasn't me.

26:43.953 --> 26:45.932
You've been bugged. Check your phone.

26:45.933 --> 26:47.032
It's your phone or your apartment,

26:47.033 --> 26:48.132
but it wasn't me.

26:48.133 --> 26:50.033
Let's go.

27:13.273 --> 27:15.866
Her name is Aubrey Klebahn.

27:15.867 --> 27:18.699
She attended Iowa
Glidden-Ralston High School.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.415
This is Basehart's assistant.

27:20.418 --> 27:22.184
She was working at Hooters in D.C.

27:22.187 --> 27:23.617
when Basehart hired her.

27:23.620 --> 27:25.801
Yes. She was with him
in the grand jury room.

27:25.804 --> 27:28.356
She worked with him for a
year, then she tried to leave,

27:28.359 --> 27:30.622
but he gave her a raise
and moved her to Chicago.

27:30.625 --> 27:31.989
Is he married?

27:31.992 --> 27:34.570
Yes. Three kids.

27:34.573 --> 27:36.333
Basehart goes home on weekends.

27:36.334 --> 27:37.614
And where does Aubrey live?

27:37.617 --> 27:40.130
In an apartment five
blocks away from Basehart.

27:40.133 --> 27:42.231
Good, but we'll need hard evidence.

27:42.234 --> 27:43.999
I'm on it.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.622
So, i-is this the plan?

27:47.625 --> 27:49.464
Blackmailing him?

27:49.467 --> 27:51.184
Yes. Why?

27:51.187 --> 27:54.445
Well, it-it just seems a little sleazy.

27:54.448 --> 27:56.299
They're out to destroy us.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.866
If ever there was a time for
situational ethics, it's now.

27:59.867 --> 28:02.132
Where you going?

28:02.133 --> 28:03.833
To buy a burner.

28:06.141 --> 28:07.307
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.

28:07.310 --> 28:08.676
We just have a few more questions

28:08.679 --> 28:10.932
and we'll wrap up your background check.

28:10.935 --> 28:12.778
- There a problem?
- No.

28:12.781 --> 28:15.999
When there's more of
us, that's good news.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.875
You don't have to talk
to us individually.

28:18.878 --> 28:22.153
Has your wife ever made a
contribution to an organization

28:22.156 --> 28:25.659
dedicated to the overthrow
of the U.S. Government?

28:25.662 --> 28:28.227
No.

28:28.230 --> 28:30.496
Phew, that's good to know.

28:30.499 --> 28:33.132
Tell us about the gun
you gave to your wife.

28:37.169 --> 28:38.356
Why?

28:38.359 --> 28:40.567
We just want to get a fuller picture.

28:40.570 --> 28:43.361
Was it a Smith & Wesson 6-4?

28:48.815 --> 28:50.815
Mr. McVeigh?

28:54.033 --> 28:57.366
What's wrong?

28:57.367 --> 28:59.099
It wasn't illegal.

28:59.108 --> 29:02.058
That's not our question.

29:02.061 --> 29:03.926
I have no more answers for you.

29:03.929 --> 29:04.997
Sit back down, sir.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.337
No. You want to give
me a job, give it to me.

29:07.340 --> 29:09.473
You want to find out
about my wife, ask her.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.800
Your wife is about to be indicted.

29:21.367 --> 29:22.718
I don't like to swear,

29:22.721 --> 29:25.507
so, understand, this
is purely for emphasis.

29:27.567 --> 29:29.599
Get the fuck out of our house.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.218
No, I mean it.

29:32.221 --> 29:34.020
Get the fuck out of our house.

29:52.233 --> 29:53.733
I think we should talk.

29:53.734 --> 29:56.715
I agree. Where are you?

29:56.718 --> 29:59.000
- I'm at the apartment. I'm coming to you.
- No.

29:59.003 --> 30:01.015
Wait there. I'm coming to you.

30:01.018 --> 30:02.906
All right, see you then.

30:11.767 --> 30:14.981
President Trump, first of
all, how are you this morning?

30:14.984 --> 30:16.933
See, we're told to
address President Trump

30:16.934 --> 30:19.599
as often as possible.
He watches every day.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.007
Mr. President,

30:21.010 --> 30:22.265
if you're watching us right now...

30:22.266 --> 30:24.299
First of all, you're
looking really good, sir.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.614
And I'm not just talking
about your border strategy.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.366
- Oh, yeah, she's a real nympho.
- Yeah?

30:29.367 --> 30:31.366
They're trying to outvote
you, Howard. It's a...

30:31.367 --> 30:32.532
It's Neil.

30:32.533 --> 30:33.632
- Neil.
- Neil.

30:33.633 --> 30:34.933
It's a trick.

30:34.934 --> 30:37.106
But I like the billboard
idea and the singing.

30:37.109 --> 30:38.504
♪ Uh-oh, you're gonna get sued. ♪

30:38.507 --> 30:40.766
Look, we vote together
on this buyback thing,

30:40.767 --> 30:43.666
we can be out of here in
time for the 8:00 curtain.

30:43.667 --> 30:44.875
- Adrian.
- Thanks.

30:44.878 --> 30:48.098
Uh, excuse me. Good timing.

30:48.101 --> 30:49.899
I think we've reached a consensus.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.666
Neil's voting with us.

30:51.667 --> 30:54.499
Great, but Rahm thinks
you made a good point.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.733
We need another smart
voice on the committee,

30:56.734 --> 30:59.532
and particularly a woman, so...

30:59.533 --> 31:00.867
Keira.

31:04.285 --> 31:05.985
She's NRA, Warren.

31:05.988 --> 31:08.020
Yes, but she's smart.

31:08.023 --> 31:10.733
Keira, this is Adrian.

31:10.734 --> 31:12.637
Mr. Boseman, how are you?

31:12.640 --> 31:14.499
I heard about your terrible time.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.467
I'm glad I can help.

31:19.700 --> 31:20.933
Is this Lucca's room?

31:20.934 --> 31:22.429
It is.

31:22.432 --> 31:24.464
I'm Francesca.

31:24.467 --> 31:28.366
It is so good to meet you.

31:28.367 --> 31:31.632
I was just wondering whether your family

31:31.635 --> 31:34.184
is from Tanzania or Nigeria.

31:34.187 --> 31:36.203
I have no idea.

31:36.206 --> 31:39.117
Well, I think we're
gonna become fast friends.

31:40.633 --> 31:44.299
I just got back from a
luxury safari in Tanzania.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.733
The nicest people.

31:46.734 --> 31:48.926
Here she is!

31:48.929 --> 31:51.199
- Safe and sound.
- Hi.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.298
Dr. Harper called from Mendocino.

31:53.301 --> 31:54.801
He asked me to step in.

31:54.804 --> 31:56.532
I'm Dr. Coulson.

31:56.533 --> 31:58.513
Oh. You're not Lucca's mom?

31:58.516 --> 32:00.293
No, that's me.

32:00.296 --> 32:02.599
I don't think I understand.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.299
Put her out of her misery, Mom.

32:04.300 --> 32:07.733
Danny, we have someone
who needs visual evidence.

32:07.734 --> 32:09.632
Hi. Danny Quinn.

32:09.633 --> 32:13.199
Of course.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.866
Well, now I see the resemblance.

32:15.867 --> 32:19.165
I mean, not that there
needed to be a resemblance.

32:19.166 --> 32:22.879
So if I could interrupt. We
need fewer people in here.

32:22.882 --> 32:24.399
I'm out of here.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.500
- Me, too.
- No, no, no, no, no, please.

32:27.503 --> 32:29.366
We have to go to work anyway.

32:29.367 --> 32:30.699
Fuck!

32:30.700 --> 32:32.968
Okay. All right, here we go, everybody.

32:32.971 --> 32:34.918
One, two, three, motherfucker!

32:34.921 --> 32:36.778
Cocksucker!

32:36.781 --> 32:40.632
It's what they do in Australia,
and I don't like Australians.

32:40.633 --> 32:43.399
It's a buyback program!
They have them everywhere.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.692
Have you even been to
Australia? They all hate Trump.

32:45.695 --> 32:46.861
What?!

32:46.864 --> 32:48.653
And ever since their buyback program,

32:48.656 --> 32:51.566
there have been twice as many
shooting deaths in Australia.

32:51.567 --> 32:54.134
Can I calm things down
by saying something here?

32:54.137 --> 32:55.200
Please.

32:55.203 --> 32:58.299
I share Adrian's concern
for these copycat murders.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.536
He's a good man. He
has skin in the game.

33:00.539 --> 33:02.304
But this isn't just about guns.

33:02.307 --> 33:04.063
One lawyer was killed in a hit-and-run,

33:04.066 --> 33:05.430
another was supposedly hung...

33:05.433 --> 33:08.325
- Majority were shot.
- If I may finish.

33:08.328 --> 33:11.041
We need to help lawyers
defend themselves.

33:11.044 --> 33:12.286
That's the bottom line.

33:12.289 --> 33:16.299
Now I liked your ad campaign,
especially the jingle.

33:17.659 --> 33:20.442
But if we want to make a
difference, we need to spend

33:20.445 --> 33:23.090
this money to arm and train lawyers.

33:23.093 --> 33:25.293
- Oh, my God.
- Every time, it's more guns.

33:25.296 --> 33:26.281
- More guns.
- No.

33:26.284 --> 33:28.325
The answer is training
and arming lawyers.

33:28.328 --> 33:31.232
This isn't about guns. This
is about self-protection.

33:31.233 --> 33:34.470
Which is ten more million
dollars spent on guns.

33:34.473 --> 33:37.138
I'd love to show you
gentlemen what I mean.

33:37.141 --> 33:38.929
We trained a few people last month.

33:44.353 --> 33:47.231
Now these are CZ Scorpions,

33:47.234 --> 33:50.593
much more firepower than
lawyers would probably need.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.489
- Are those the instructors?
- Yes.

33:52.492 --> 33:55.700
It was a very hot day,
so they had to make do.

33:55.703 --> 33:57.399
- Justifiable.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.933
I also want to show you this briefcase,

33:59.934 --> 34:04.466
which opens to offer
a bulletproof shield.

34:04.467 --> 34:06.232
- Hey.
- Whoa, that is so clever.

34:06.233 --> 34:08.899
Now just think of every
lawyer with one of these.

34:08.900 --> 34:13.473
- And this is a Heckler & Koch MP5K...
- Oh.

34:13.476 --> 34:16.676
All reasonably priced.
I'll check the chamber.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.702
Unloaded.

34:18.705 --> 34:21.492
Hmm. There you go.

34:22.735 --> 34:24.935
Yeah, take it.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.603
We're fucked.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.799
I think we...

34:32.800 --> 34:35.699
Shh. Don't talk.

34:52.842 --> 34:55.789
I think I'm being bugged.

35:03.257 --> 35:06.605
_

35:13.725 --> 35:16.178
_

35:22.507 --> 35:25.421
_

35:29.358 --> 35:31.147
_

35:34.202 --> 35:35.915
_

35:42.602 --> 35:45.688
_

35:58.934 --> 36:01.133
Kurt.

36:04.060 --> 36:07.194
They may ask you about
someone named Tully.

36:10.617 --> 36:12.734
- I need to tell you...
- No.

36:19.261 --> 36:23.294
- Actually, I do...
- No, you don't.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.600
We're starting over.

36:34.432 --> 36:36.030
Epidural.

36:36.033 --> 36:40.132
Epidural. Epidural.

36:40.133 --> 36:42.132
Those are pretty words.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.564
One word, love. Epidural.

36:44.567 --> 36:46.099
One word.

36:46.102 --> 36:48.953
Are you and Mom

36:48.956 --> 36:52.021
intentionally not fighting 'cause of me?

36:52.024 --> 36:54.064
No, we don't, we don't fight anymore.

36:54.067 --> 36:56.750
Why's that?

36:56.753 --> 36:59.621
So, I hear that you helped your brother.

36:59.624 --> 37:02.424
That was a bad segue.

37:04.987 --> 37:07.430
What are those two scheming about?

37:10.067 --> 37:12.397
So your son knocked my daughter up?

37:12.400 --> 37:14.232
Well, that's just the way it happened.

37:14.235 --> 37:16.969
Your daughter was just sitting
there with a little parasol.

37:16.972 --> 37:18.828
Oh, they're not getting married?

37:18.831 --> 37:19.897
I know.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.391
- No, that was a question.
- Right.

37:21.394 --> 37:24.264
They are not getting
married, but it's fine

37:24.267 --> 37:25.932
because it's a different time.

37:25.933 --> 37:26.789
Why is that?

37:26.792 --> 37:28.747
Why is what? I don't
understand the question

37:28.750 --> 37:30.435
because they don't need to get married.

37:30.438 --> 37:31.719
- Why not?
- You know what?

37:31.722 --> 37:33.376
I think you are gunning
for a fight here,

37:33.379 --> 37:35.601
and I am not sure I understand why.

37:35.604 --> 37:37.349
- Because when I arrived...
- What? Yes.

37:37.352 --> 37:39.799
...you asked me what I thought
of the movie Black Panther...

37:39.800 --> 37:42.032
- Oh, that was a good movie. No, that is...
- ...which I haven't seen.

37:42.033 --> 37:44.482
Have you seen Get Out? You should.

37:44.485 --> 37:47.114
You sang to me a tribal Tanzanian song.

37:47.117 --> 37:49.665
- You're welcome. I'm a linguist.
- And your son,

37:49.666 --> 37:52.066
- who did get my daughter pregnant...
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

37:52.067 --> 37:54.765
...isn't here to see his son's
birth, so that's probably why.

37:54.766 --> 37:56.399
- Oh, well, your daughter, okay...
- Yes.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.032
...is two weeks early, and my
son is racing here right now.

37:59.033 --> 38:00.732
Yes, and you should have some
empathy and some compassion

38:00.733 --> 38:01.999
- for my daughter.
- You know what?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.899
- Let's just let our hair down.
- Okay, fine, that's just fine.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.166
Go ahead, bitch, go ahead.

38:05.167 --> 38:06.732
What do you want to know?

38:06.733 --> 38:10.832
Thanks for coming back, Ms. Lockhart.

38:10.833 --> 38:13.157
No problem. Fire away.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.225
Appropriate words.

38:15.228 --> 38:18.964
Do you have a Smith & Wesson model 6-4?

38:18.967 --> 38:22.005
I do, or rather, I did.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.799
Good, so...

38:23.800 --> 38:25.453
You did? Where is it now?

38:25.456 --> 38:28.110
One of the partners at my firm was shot.

38:28.113 --> 38:30.102
A few days later, I took

38:30.105 --> 38:33.738
my Smith & Wesson to the
police to have it melted down.

38:36.524 --> 38:38.866
Don't you want to know why?

38:38.867 --> 38:42.066
I wanted nothing more to do with guns.

38:42.067 --> 38:43.932
I saw what one did to my partner...

38:43.933 --> 38:45.466
Recently, did the Democratic Committee

38:45.469 --> 38:47.132
hire you as their law firm?

38:47.133 --> 38:49.999
Attorney-client privilege prevents me

38:50.000 --> 38:51.586
from answering that question.

38:51.589 --> 38:54.208
Did the DNC decide
against hiring your firm

38:54.211 --> 38:56.067
because of something you said?

38:58.167 --> 38:59.866
Attorney-client privilege

38:59.867 --> 39:03.141
prevents me from answering
your ridiculous question.

39:03.144 --> 39:04.464
In meetings with the DNC,

39:04.467 --> 39:08.153
did you argue for violently
overthrowing the government?

39:08.156 --> 39:10.489
I have never argued

39:10.492 --> 39:12.836
for the violent overthrow
of my government.

39:12.839 --> 39:14.663
I'm just done

39:14.666 --> 39:15.999
with being the adult in the room.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.166
Okay, then take to the streets.

39:18.167 --> 39:22.266
Man the barricades. Because if
that's what you really think,

39:22.267 --> 39:23.732
you've given up on law.

39:23.733 --> 39:24.883
You don't know.

39:24.886 --> 39:27.064
I have a Smith & Wesson 6-4 in my desk,

39:27.067 --> 39:31.233
and I'm this close to
taking to the streets.

39:31.234 --> 39:33.334
Is that your voice, ma'am?

39:36.733 --> 39:40.832
I would like to consult with my lawyer.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.622
I was worried about that.

39:42.625 --> 39:44.266
But, you know.

39:44.267 --> 39:45.899
Uh, yeah, I know what you're saying,

39:45.900 --> 39:49.390
but don't worry about it.
I'll take care of that. Yeah.

39:49.393 --> 39:50.959
Ruth.

39:52.422 --> 39:55.099
Uh, I need a minute.
We'll talk in the car.

39:55.100 --> 39:57.399
Give me a minute.

39:57.400 --> 40:00.516
- Can I talk to you?
- What's wrong?

40:00.519 --> 40:02.399
I think you may have a mole.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.507
Somebody has been leaking the audiotape

40:04.510 --> 40:07.075
of our impeachment
pitch to a prosecutor.

40:07.078 --> 40:08.932
Why do you say that?

40:08.933 --> 40:11.299
Diane Lockhart was just dragged
in front of a grand jury,

40:11.300 --> 40:13.399
and they played the tape to her.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.314
Okay, I'm gonna tell you something

40:16.317 --> 40:18.083
that's gonna make you
angry for a second,

40:18.086 --> 40:20.765
but I want you to remember:
keep your eye on the goal.

40:20.766 --> 40:23.132
- What goal?
- November.

40:23.135 --> 40:25.474
Taking back the House and the Senate.

40:25.477 --> 40:28.631
Ruth, what's-what's gonna make me mad?

40:28.634 --> 40:32.099
I gave the tape to the prosecutor.

40:32.102 --> 40:35.200
You gave the audiotape
to the prosecutor?

40:35.203 --> 40:36.294
Your partner was making

40:36.297 --> 40:38.286
some unsavory statements
about assassination

40:38.289 --> 40:39.622
that were going to embarrass us.

40:39.625 --> 40:41.325
So you gave them an even worse tape?

40:41.328 --> 40:42.607
Lower your voice.

40:42.610 --> 40:45.232
We needed to show that we won't
stand for that kind of talk.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.779
She was conspiring with a client

40:46.782 --> 40:48.364
to hide an assassination attempt.

40:48.367 --> 40:49.969
- He was joking.
- Oh, yeah,

40:49.972 --> 40:52.999
and how will that go over with
the press? Seriously? Joking?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.389
Instead, the Democratic
Party looks heroic.

40:55.392 --> 40:57.391
We heard dangerous talk from a lawyer,

40:57.394 --> 40:58.763
cut off all of our contact,

40:58.766 --> 41:00.966
and turned over everything
we knew to a prosecutor.

41:00.967 --> 41:02.891
You fucked her.

41:02.894 --> 41:06.763
No, we acted responsibly.
She fucked herself.

41:06.766 --> 41:08.938
I'm sorry for your friend, Liz,

41:08.941 --> 41:11.313
but I want to win.

41:11.316 --> 41:15.915
The Democrats need to
stop being such pussies.

41:15.918 --> 41:18.524
We have to win.

41:21.822 --> 41:23.355
Get the door.

41:29.367 --> 41:31.742
Hey, hi, hello. Hi, hi, hi.

41:31.745 --> 41:34.711
Uh, Lucca Quinn's room? Thank...

41:34.714 --> 41:36.196
Where is the epidural?!

41:36.199 --> 41:38.607
We need you to push. That's
why we curb the effect.

41:38.610 --> 41:41.233
You-you-you motherfucker!

41:41.234 --> 41:43.299
You bring, you bring the drugs back!

41:43.300 --> 41:45.832
You cocksucking asshole!

41:45.833 --> 41:48.932
- Ma!
- Colin, there you are.

41:48.933 --> 41:50.383
How are you, dear?

41:50.386 --> 41:52.964
Lucca's family's religious.
Did you know that?

41:52.967 --> 41:53.970
Okay, stop, Ma.

41:53.973 --> 41:55.483
- I think he's the father.
- Lucca, hey.

41:55.485 --> 41:56.833
Colin, they curb the epidural.

41:56.836 --> 41:58.899
Can you believe that?
They don't tell you that

41:58.900 --> 42:02.166
- in any motherfucking class or book!
- It's all right.

42:02.167 --> 42:04.399
What does it matter if
the baby is baptized?

42:04.400 --> 42:06.299
If you don't believe in God,

42:06.300 --> 42:08.233
then what harm can it do?

42:08.234 --> 42:09.500
Because it's stupid!

42:09.503 --> 42:10.866
Oh, as opposed to dressing him

42:10.867 --> 42:14.266
in an Ankara Dashiki,
and playing The Lion King.

42:14.267 --> 42:16.799
- That is culturally appropriate.
- Hey, hey, hey, Mom!

42:16.800 --> 42:18.899
All right, hey, stop! Everybody out.

42:18.900 --> 42:21.399
Please, out. Ma, out.

42:21.400 --> 42:24.665
You... Hi. Colin. It's
nice to finally meet you.

42:24.666 --> 42:26.294
You have to leave now. Thank you.

42:26.297 --> 42:28.414
They want an evangelical baptism.

42:28.417 --> 42:30.364
Mom, that is just not true.

42:30.367 --> 42:31.866
What do you mean that's not true?

42:31.867 --> 42:32.799
Yes, it's true.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.797
- You're not even religious.
- How do you know?

42:34.800 --> 42:36.349
Can we focus here?

42:36.352 --> 42:37.613
"Can we focus?"

42:37.616 --> 42:40.141
- Let's get 'em out of here.
- You're rude, too!

42:45.400 --> 42:48.199
Maybe we aren't gonna
hear anything tonight.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.594
How many hours of labor so far?

42:50.597 --> 42:52.750
- 14.
- Ai-yi-yi.

42:54.844 --> 42:58.544
God, we are a depressed bunch.

42:58.547 --> 43:02.433
Maybe we should start drinking now.

43:02.434 --> 43:03.799
Oh, here we go.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.032
Some good news.

43:05.033 --> 43:06.966
- Lucca?
- No.

43:06.967 --> 43:09.433
Bad news.

43:09.434 --> 43:12.216
We were looking into Basehart
and his assistant, Aubrey.

43:12.219 --> 43:13.799
- The affair?
- Yeah.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.176
We talked to Aubrey's roommate.

43:15.179 --> 43:17.864
Basehart didn't move her to
Chicago to carry on an affair.

43:17.867 --> 43:20.367
He moved her to Chicago...

43:20.370 --> 43:22.369
to break up one.

43:22.372 --> 43:25.680
Apparently, the rumor was
Trump was sleeping with her.

43:25.683 --> 43:27.397
- You know what?
- Oh, God.

43:27.400 --> 43:28.688
Yep.

43:28.691 --> 43:30.086
Basehart was being a good guy,

43:30.089 --> 43:32.716
getting her out of D.C. and
away from the White House.

43:32.719 --> 43:34.732
Damn, I don't know what's worse...

43:34.733 --> 43:37.107
Having nothing to use against him now,

43:37.110 --> 43:39.107
or realizing he's a good guy.

43:39.110 --> 43:41.227
Okay, I'm cracking one open.

43:41.230 --> 43:42.897
I think we need it.

43:51.766 --> 43:52.999
Want me to get it?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.966
I...

43:55.967 --> 43:57.932
Hello?

43:57.933 --> 44:00.399
Uh, Mr. Boseman, hi. Colin Morrello.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.216
Uh, Lucca wanted me to call you

44:02.219 --> 44:05.239
and tell you that... we have a son.

44:06.900 --> 44:09.132
That is so good to hear, Colin.

44:09.133 --> 44:11.399
- Hey, hey, we're all here waiting.
- Yeah.

44:11.400 --> 44:14.799
Well, you guys can go to sleep now.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.099
Joseph Quinn-Morrello
was born at 1:15 a.m.

44:18.100 --> 44:20.966
Six pounds, five ounces.

44:20.967 --> 44:25.185
Looks like a cross between
Don King and Karl Marx.

44:26.636 --> 44:27.969
Congratulations.

44:27.972 --> 44:29.397
Congratulations, Colin.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.174
All right, good news.

44:31.177 --> 44:32.563
Yeah. Finally.

44:36.188 --> 44:39.166
To Joseph Quinn-Morello,

44:39.167 --> 44:44.132
born six pounds, five ounces.

44:44.133 --> 44:45.492
Hear, hear.

44:45.495 --> 44:47.827
May he make a change for a better world.

44:47.830 --> 44:49.197
God knows we need it.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.267
Hear, hear.

44:53.563 --> 44:55.266
Good thing nobody
showed up to our party.

44:55.267 --> 44:56.832
We've got 20 cases of these.

44:56.833 --> 44:58.899
All right, let's get to it. Come on.

45:00.078 --> 45:01.999
He's beautiful.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.200
I know.

45:06.484 --> 45:08.950
Our parents are crazy.

45:08.953 --> 45:13.063
No, your mom is crazy.

45:13.066 --> 45:15.926
Well, your mom gives
her a run for the money.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.766
I don't think I'll like D.C.

45:32.350 --> 45:35.916
Give it a year and I bet you will.

45:48.833 --> 45:50.233
We should go home.

45:50.234 --> 45:51.800
Mm.

45:54.625 --> 45:59.066
You know, a year ago...

45:59.067 --> 46:01.958
we were looking out at
a blacked-out Chicago,

46:01.961 --> 46:05.872
and I was depressed, and you said to me

46:05.875 --> 46:11.591
that the only constant
that we have is the law.

46:11.594 --> 46:13.233
Yeah.

46:13.234 --> 46:15.091
We're not a country of men and women,

46:15.094 --> 46:19.185
we're a country of laws.

46:19.188 --> 46:21.367
Do you still believe that?

46:24.719 --> 46:26.765
Yes.

46:26.766 --> 46:28.399
That took you a while.

46:31.133 --> 46:34.933
It's been a very odd year, Diane.

46:38.295 --> 46:41.185
Yesterday, I read that an undocumented

46:41.188 --> 46:44.966
pregnant woman was
sent back to the country

46:44.967 --> 46:47.832
where she was born.

46:47.833 --> 46:51.333
There were death threats
against her there,

46:51.334 --> 46:55.866
and within six months, she was murdered.

46:55.867 --> 47:00.166
It was the law to deport her, but...

47:00.167 --> 47:02.132
I mean, it wasn't...

47:02.133 --> 47:04.166
- Just.
- Exactly.

47:04.167 --> 47:07.474
What does it matter if
we're a country of laws

47:07.477 --> 47:09.966
if the laws aren't just?

47:09.967 --> 47:11.433
So, what option do we have?

47:11.434 --> 47:13.607
Placing justice above the law.

47:13.610 --> 47:16.213
- Doesn't justice define the law?
- Mm-mm.

47:16.216 --> 47:17.482
Conscience does.

47:17.485 --> 47:21.144
- It-it has to.
- So, then,

47:21.147 --> 47:22.846
it's okay to break the law?

47:26.833 --> 47:29.765
If it offends your conscience...

47:29.766 --> 47:31.100
yeah.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.966
I think I know what I need to do.

47:35.967 --> 47:38.360
What?

47:38.363 --> 47:40.564
Lie.

47:43.623 --> 47:45.782
Ted Willoughby is on your committee.

47:45.785 --> 47:47.585
Yes.

47:49.208 --> 47:51.657
Can you give him a scoop?

47:53.767 --> 47:56.699
Four to two, the motion passes.

47:56.700 --> 47:59.199
The "Help Lawyers
Defend Themselves" act.

47:59.200 --> 48:00.832
- Hey, good job.
- Yeah.

48:00.833 --> 48:02.032
Well done.

48:02.033 --> 48:04.732
Who will write the proposal?

48:04.733 --> 48:07.500
I'd love to, but I have school.

48:07.503 --> 48:09.624
You know, I have to
head to the gym, so...

48:09.627 --> 48:11.532
Okay, I'll do it.

48:11.535 --> 48:12.934
- Yeah?
- Great. Hey, great.

48:12.937 --> 48:14.202
- Thanks.
- All right.

48:19.033 --> 48:21.966
Seriously, you want to?

48:21.967 --> 48:23.866
Here's the thing about that group.

48:23.867 --> 48:26.333
Nobody took minutes.

48:26.334 --> 48:29.999
Nobody will read the proposal.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.766
You can't. Can you?

48:32.767 --> 48:35.094
Sure I can.

48:35.097 --> 48:37.797
No, no, this is not a Hannity situation.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.932
Michael Cohen is not my attorney.

48:39.933 --> 48:43.032
He's... he's-he's more of a role model.

48:43.033 --> 48:45.199
Yeah. Okay?

48:45.200 --> 48:46.732
Hey, Ted.

48:46.733 --> 48:49.133
- Oh, hey, man.
- Oh.

48:49.134 --> 48:51.665
- Hey.
- I gotta say, I think it's real bullshit

48:51.666 --> 48:52.834
the way they're going after Trump

48:52.836 --> 48:55.766
for this relationship
with this Hooters waitress.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.683
I know. Ex-Hooters.

48:57.686 --> 48:59.310
And it never even happened.

48:59.313 --> 49:03.600
And I have evidence that
it never really happened.

49:08.800 --> 49:12.166
Ooh, they just push you
out the door, don't they?

49:12.167 --> 49:15.399
I'd rather be at home anyway, Mom.

49:21.134 --> 49:23.100
So, Colin, huh?

49:24.967 --> 49:26.732
Well, that sounds critical.

49:26.735 --> 49:28.927
No, he just seems a
little more white bread

49:28.930 --> 49:30.485
than your usual guys.

49:30.488 --> 49:31.864
- He's a good guy.
- Yeah.

49:31.867 --> 49:33.999
Who wasn't here when you were in labor.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.425
Mom, why are you poisoning this?

49:35.428 --> 49:37.438
Oh, look who's here.

49:37.441 --> 49:39.199
Oh...

49:39.200 --> 49:42.032
Yes.

49:42.035 --> 49:46.292
Oh, beautiful.

49:49.100 --> 49:51.620
I'm going to give you
some advice, Lucca.

49:51.623 --> 49:53.789
Oh, this'll be fun.

49:53.792 --> 49:56.172
It's the garage door test.

49:56.175 --> 49:57.632
- The garage...
- Yes.

49:57.633 --> 50:01.565
My mom gave it to me, and
I'm going to give it to you.

50:01.566 --> 50:07.199
Now, if you want to know if
a relationship is working,

50:07.200 --> 50:10.828
when you drive home from work
and you open the garage door,

50:10.831 --> 50:13.961
are you happy when you
see his car parked there,

50:13.964 --> 50:16.199
or are you disappointed?

50:16.200 --> 50:20.565
- I live in an apartment.
- Don't be contentious.

50:20.566 --> 50:25.391
If you see his car parked on
the street, are you happy or sad?

50:25.394 --> 50:29.492
Do you want to come home
and be alone or be with him?

50:29.495 --> 50:33.094
Mama, I don't like coming home
and seeing anybody there, ever.

50:33.097 --> 50:35.347
Well, then there's your answer.

50:35.350 --> 50:37.016
What?

50:37.019 --> 50:40.584
That I should be alone
for the rest of my life?

50:40.587 --> 50:45.064
No. Wait until you're
happy to see someone's car.

50:47.334 --> 50:51.599
That is such Southern
Californian advice.

50:51.600 --> 50:53.599
But it's not wrong.

50:53.600 --> 50:56.833
Are you and dad getting divorced?

51:07.574 --> 51:09.808
I love you.

51:18.700 --> 51:20.866
How you feeling? You all right?

51:20.867 --> 51:24.866
Yeah. I'm just tired.

51:24.869 --> 51:27.539
Something my mom said.

51:27.542 --> 51:30.900
- What?
- Nothing.

51:41.435 --> 51:43.000
Maia and Marissa called.

51:43.003 --> 51:45.438
Said they wanted to
stop by the apartment,

51:45.441 --> 51:47.533
see the baby.

51:51.292 --> 51:52.959
Really?

51:59.628 --> 52:01.562
I can try to get rid of them fast.

52:01.565 --> 52:02.930
No.

52:02.933 --> 52:05.333
I want them here.

52:05.334 --> 52:07.363
I just realized I want them here.

52:09.463 --> 52:12.128
Hi. I know we're not
supposed to bother you,

52:12.131 --> 52:14.164
- but we couldn't stay away.
- Ah!

52:14.167 --> 52:15.932
I promise we'll go really fast.

52:15.933 --> 52:17.233
We just wanted to take a peek at him.

52:17.234 --> 52:18.699
Ah!

52:18.700 --> 52:20.665
You're a dad. Oh.

52:20.666 --> 52:24.732
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

52:24.733 --> 52:26.011
Look at you.

52:26.014 --> 52:28.864
- Look how special.
- He's so cute.

52:28.867 --> 52:31.000
What I don't like is
how mainstream media

52:31.003 --> 52:32.966
keeps pushing these fake affair stories.

52:32.967 --> 52:34.735
- Oh, my gosh. Isn't it awful?
- Liz!

52:34.738 --> 52:36.797
Like this new one about President Trump

52:36.800 --> 52:38.632
and an ex-Hooters waitress.

52:38.633 --> 52:42.641
Funny thing is I was just
leaked a photo of this waitress

52:42.644 --> 52:44.776
with what some people consider

52:44.779 --> 52:45.945
her true lover.

52:45.948 --> 52:47.378
- What?
- Yup.

52:47.381 --> 52:52.070
This is Patrick Basehart,
a prosecutor in Chicago.

52:52.073 --> 52:54.766
He even transported her to be with him.

52:54.767 --> 52:56.820
Look, I don't want to tell
the president what to do,

52:56.823 --> 52:59.441
but if I were him, I'd
fire this prosecutor.

52:59.444 --> 53:01.303
I know it's not a good idea to judge

53:01.306 --> 53:03.799
before we get all the facts,
but it's kind of disgusting...

53:03.802 --> 53:05.133
What do you think?

53:05.136 --> 53:08.099
I think he's going to
fire the prosecutor.

53:08.100 --> 53:10.847
Upsetting is the word
that I've always used.

53:10.850 --> 53:13.964
Why isn't he stepping forward?

53:13.967 --> 53:15.799
What are you doing?

53:15.800 --> 53:19.266
- Meeting her.
- Why?

53:19.267 --> 53:23.899
This past month, I've been
feeling at peace and in control.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.883
And I realized that's not enough.

53:25.886 --> 53:27.431
Why not?

53:27.434 --> 53:29.501
Because people are out to get me.

53:32.231 --> 53:34.063
It's time to fight.

53:34.066 --> 53:36.166
Ladies.

53:36.167 --> 53:37.766
It's, uh, the staff meeting.

53:37.767 --> 53:40.234
- We're on our way.
- Okay.

53:50.547 --> 53:52.212
Good afternoon, good afternoon.

53:52.215 --> 53:54.047
This just in from The New York Times.

53:54.050 --> 53:57.735
Tony Mundy, a Chicago
freelance reporter,

53:57.738 --> 54:01.125
was killed on the way to
work by an unknown gunman.

54:01.128 --> 54:05.066
The note left on his body
read, "Kill all reporters."

54:05.067 --> 54:07.305
Wow. Just like the lawyers.

54:07.308 --> 54:09.742
Lawyers have to be
heaving a sigh of relief.

54:09.745 --> 54:11.328
That's right. Time will only tell

54:11.331 --> 54:14.070
if this means that reporters
are now under assault.

54:14.073 --> 54:17.485
President Trump just tweeted, "Sad news.

54:17.488 --> 54:20.695
Mainstream media needs to learn.

54:20.698 --> 54:22.233
#TheStorm."

54:22.234 --> 54:25.665
The storm. Uh, he's referring
to something he commented on...

54:25.666 --> 54:27.133
It was when President Trump

54:27.136 --> 54:29.932
met with top military
brass back in June.

54:29.933 --> 54:32.316
You guys know what this represents.

54:32.319 --> 54:33.719
Tell us, sir.

54:33.722 --> 54:35.883
Maybe it's the calm before the storm.

54:35.886 --> 54:37.703
What storm, Mr. President?

54:37.706 --> 54:39.666
You'll find out.
