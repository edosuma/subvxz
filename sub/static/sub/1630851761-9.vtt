-Do you know Timor?

16:35.869 --> 16:38.831
-Do you know Igor?
-(LAUGHS) Okay.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.541
I don't know who--
who are these people

16:40.624 --> 16:44.253
-that I'm supposed to know?
-Igor from Prospr.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.587
Timor from Cukor.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.340
What am I, in a Columbo episode
all of a sudden?

16:48.424 --> 16:50.467
I-- no,
I don't know, uh, any Timor.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.928
Why is it you all look alike,
and you have "or"

16:53.011 --> 16:54.430
-on the end of your names.
-I...

16:54.513 --> 16:57.641
-I'm not related to anyone.
-And you all say, "Shplendid."

16:57.725 --> 16:59.268
-You all say, "Shplendid."
-I say, "Shplendid"
all the time.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.936
You say, "Shplendid,"
they say, "Shplendid."

17:01.019 --> 17:02.312
Who doesn't say "Shplendid"
in their life--

17:02.396 --> 17:03.856
-We don't say, "Shplendid."
-We don't say, "Shplendid."

17:03.939 --> 17:05.441
I've never said splendid
with him in my life.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.775
Nobody-- nobody else says,
"Shplendid."

17:06.859 --> 17:09.653
People say, "Shplendid" at least
twice a day, it is fact.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.655
Okay, I am not buying
any of this.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.742
I think you're all in cahoots.
You're getting a kickback.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.118
-Kickback?
-You're recommending somebody

17:16.201 --> 17:19.705
to your brother, Timor,
and then he's paying you

17:19.788 --> 17:20.914
for the recommendation.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.834
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

17:23.917 --> 17:24.960
Come on.

17:25.043 --> 17:27.463
No, no. This is fantasy.
This is science fiction.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.339
-This is Star Wars.
-No, no, no,
this is not fantasy.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.632
This is spaceship to moon.
This is nothing.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.925
LARRY: I'm gonna tell you
another thing.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.635
You know what's so disappointing
about this?

17:33.719 --> 17:35.304
-What?
-Americans have lost

17:35.387 --> 17:36.972
complete faith
in their institutions,

17:37.055 --> 17:40.100
their politicians,
their priests, the policeman

17:40.184 --> 17:42.478
But we depend on the concierge

17:42.561 --> 17:44.605
to give us advice
and recommendations.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.648
Where's the best
nail salon around here?

17:46.732 --> 17:48.233
Where can I go for a jog?

17:48.317 --> 17:50.944
You are the last bastion
of trust.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.947
And if we no longer trust
our concierge...

17:55.532 --> 17:56.617
then we have nothing.

17:57.618 --> 18:01.622
I don't know what to say,
uh, except...

18:01.705 --> 18:04.166
Emerald Nail Salon
is down the street.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.626
Okay, Gregor.
Come on, let's go.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.669
MacArthur Park is--
is wonderful.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.670
LARRY: Yeah.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.838
ACTOR: (ON TV)
Hey, what do you say?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.840
ACTOR 2: (ON TV) Okay,
we're coming. Come on.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.426
Now listen, John.
You're a pitcher, now get in...

18:14.510 --> 18:16.887
You know, about the, uh,

18:16.970 --> 18:19.556
vaginal rejuvenation,
I'm-- I'm-- I'm--

18:19.640 --> 18:21.975
(INHALES)
I'm having second thoughts.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.353
-What?
-I looked things up, I saw some

18:24.436 --> 18:29.900
of the images on the computer
of inflammation and hematomas

18:29.983 --> 18:32.486
-and I--
-Don't think of the down side.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.531
What you have to focus on
is the upside.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.449
-The tightening and the lift.
-(GRUNTS)

18:37.533 --> 18:39.785
-And the beautiful...
-IRMA: Yeah.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.579
-...the beautiful vagina...
-IRMA: Yeah, yeah, I-- I--

18:42.663 --> 18:45.874
-...that's going to emerge.
-Yes! But I gotta stop

18:45.958 --> 18:47.042
Googling "vagina."

18:47.125 --> 18:49.294
You're getting a tightening
and a lift, that's all.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.506
-It's not a big deal.
-I wish I could... (INHALES)

18:52.589 --> 18:55.551
...talk to somebody
who's had it done.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.011
All right, well we'll get
you somebody to talk to.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.388
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-Oh.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.223
MAN ON TV:
Who wrote that speech for you?

19:01.306 --> 19:02.724
-(KNEE CLICKING)
-Oh, my God!

19:02.808 --> 19:03.892
Your knees when you stand.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.102
It's like somebody's marching--

19:05.185 --> 19:06.937
LARRY: Oh, Jesus Christ!
Shut the fuck up, will ya?

19:09.439 --> 19:11.525
-Huh.
-I'm here to apologize.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.694
-Yeah. Okay.
-All right?

19:13.777 --> 19:15.529
I never should've
screamed at Irma.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.155
-Hey.
-I feel terrible

19:17.239 --> 19:18.866
about what I said
to her at the party.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.742
If you really wanna make nice...

19:21.118 --> 19:22.369
What?

19:22.452 --> 19:25.330
...tell her you got
vaginal rejuvenation surgery.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.748
Why? Why? Why would I do that?

19:26.832 --> 19:29.626
Because, she wants to get
vaginal rejuvenation surgery.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.211
And this'll put her
out of commission

19:31.295 --> 19:32.296
for six weeks. So...

19:32.379 --> 19:33.797
Oh, so, you don't have
to have sex with her?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.048
-LARRY: There you go.
-All right.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.384
But now-- now,
she's having second thoughts.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.511
And she wants to talk
to somebody who had it.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.889
-So, just tell her you had it.
-So my vagina has to get

19:41.972 --> 19:43.265
involved in this whole
fucking thing?

19:43.348 --> 19:45.267
Well, this way,
at least I could control it.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.936
Just tell her it's been great.
You've had great sex

19:48.020 --> 19:49.646
and it looks great, whatever.

19:49.730 --> 19:53.483
I'll do this for you.
You gotta do something for me.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.193
-Name it.
-There's this really,

19:55.277 --> 19:58.822
really gorgeous,
expensive vase I want.

19:58.906 --> 20:02.910
-Hmm, a vase.
-Get Jeff to buy me that vase,

20:02.993 --> 20:05.412
I'll tell her I did
a million different things

20:05.495 --> 20:06.663
-to my vagina.
-That's... What?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.081
I have to talk Jeff
into getting you

20:08.165 --> 20:10.584
-an expensive vase?
-Yes, you do. Tit for tat.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.338
-Okay, deal.
-And what did I have done?

20:14.421 --> 20:16.048
You know, you had,
uh, tightening,

20:16.131 --> 20:18.133
-and, uh, and a lift.
-Oh, God!

20:18.884 --> 20:20.052
(LAUGHS)

20:20.928 --> 20:23.096
-Irma, please...
-IRMA: Well...

20:23.180 --> 20:26.350
...please,
please accept my apology.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.517
-I feel--
-Get out the way,

20:27.601 --> 20:28.644
I'll turn this off.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.813
I feel horrible, I just--

20:31.897 --> 20:34.107
I-- I can't even tell you
what came over.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.152
Jeff, my fucking husband, Jeff,
has been cheating on me,

20:37.235 --> 20:38.946
and I thought it was you.

20:39.029 --> 20:42.282
And I just-- I went crazy,
and it wasn't you.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.285
It was this little putain who
works for the Hulu guy, and--

20:45.369 --> 20:47.162
Wait, why would I want to schtup
your husband,

20:47.245 --> 20:49.623
you know, when I'm with this
incredible man?

20:49.706 --> 20:52.250
Look at this beautiful senior
that I'm with,

20:52.334 --> 20:55.128
-you know, I mean--
-I went crazy, I went crazy.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.254
Yeah, she feels--

20:56.338 --> 20:57.756
-she feels terrible.
-Please, I feel horrible.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.133
I've had gas ever since.
I have my bubble back.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.177
I can't sleep, I've been, ugh,
my...

21:02.260 --> 21:05.681
-Okay, okay. She's apologized.
-IRMA: It was what you heard.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.015
Can you accept her apology?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.934
-IRMA: Physically affecting me.
-She's apologizing.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.311
I will be the better person
and I will accept your apology.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.897
I mean, I don't think
you're the better person,
she's the one who's apologizing.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.232
She the better person
for apologizing.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.317
Okay, I accept.
I accept your apology.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.987
-Fantastic. And now...
-Yes.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.155
...Susie has something else...

21:22.239 --> 21:24.366
-Oh!
-...she like to tell you.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.702
So, I hear
that you're interested

21:26.785 --> 21:31.331
in a vaginal rejuvenation.
Is that correct?

21:31.415 --> 21:33.417
-You told her?
-You said you want to talk

21:33.500 --> 21:37.379
to someone who had one.
What better person?

21:37.462 --> 21:41.591
-So, what did you get done?
-I got a tightening and a lift.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.927
Did you get
the labial reconstruction too?

21:44.011 --> 21:46.888
The labia, the--
the clitoris, the--

21:46.972 --> 21:49.391
The clitoris, they unhooded it?

21:49.474 --> 21:51.560
-The-- Ye-- Yeah--
-You had the hood taken--

21:51.643 --> 21:53.895
Yeah, yes,
it made everything better.
I don't know the details.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.814
Yeah, yeah, they took
the hood off the clitoris.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.357
-Yeah. Okay.
-Everything is better--

21:57.441 --> 21:59.026
Susie...

21:59.109 --> 22:01.028
could I, you know, take a look?

22:01.111 --> 22:02.070
At my vagina?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.697
Yeah, she-- she's got
to get going, uh,

22:03.780 --> 22:05.449
you know, she'll show you
the vagina another time.

22:05.532 --> 22:06.825
-Another time.
-But that would help

22:06.908 --> 22:08.326
-'cause you get a visualization.
-LARRY: She's in a hurry.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.746
-Have a vagina viewing
another time.
-Another time.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.039
-Another time.
-You know what?

22:12.122 --> 22:14.916
You'll have a vagina
viewing party, a vaj-ama party.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.543
-Okay.
-SUSIE GREENE:
Great to see you.

22:16.626 --> 22:19.963
Thanks for the apology.

my wife's been in the room.

I wonder if you wouldn't mind

22:57.292 --> 22:58.877
just giving her a quick call

22:58.960 --> 23:01.630
to ask her if she saw a sweater
in the room?

23:01.713 --> 23:03.632
I'm not gonna call my wife
about a sweater, Larry.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.300

going on right now.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.968
She's studying
for her real estate license.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.678
I'm not gonna bother her
with a sweater, but...

23:08.762 --> 23:10.597
We're talking about
five seconds.

I don't wanna interrupt,

I'll-- I'll try, yeah. I'll try.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.402
You'll try?

23:24.486 --> 23:25.737
-What does that mean?
-BEN: Yeah, I'll try.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.322
What does that mean,
"You'll try"?

23:27.405 --> 23:28.281
You know what, Larry?

this has already been a lot.

-Now I need to rest. I--
-But you are resting,

23:31.701 --> 23:33.245
you're laying-- you're laying
on a bed. You're resting.

I understand,

but you're resting.
You're laying down on a bed...

23:38.208 --> 23:40.168

with my eyes closed.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.419
Oh, you wanna sleep?

23:41.503 --> 23:43.672
No, I just wanna rest
with my eyes closed for a while.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.715
So, you consider resting
as something done

23:45.799 --> 23:47.801
with your eyes closed only?

23:47.884 --> 23:50.512
Look, I've-- I gotta get
back to resting, please, Larry.

you ever saw his wife

You mean you don't know

Or you don't know
if you saw her with a sweater?

24:16.413 --> 24:18.999
-I'm busy working.
-Yeah, I understand you're busy

24:19.082 --> 24:21.376

Ah. I can't... (GROANS)
