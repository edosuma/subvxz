WEBVTT

00:09.775 --> 00:11.902
We've time for one more, Roz.

00:12.069 --> 00:14.155
We have Sid on three.

00:14.321 --> 00:16.532
Hello, Sid. I'm listening.

00:16.699 --> 00:23.831
(Sid) 'Hello, Dr Crane. I fear talking
on the phone to people I do not know.

00:25.457 --> 00:27.501
'I freeze up.

00:28.836 --> 00:33.799
'It is a severe handicap
in today's fast-paced world.'

00:35.676 --> 00:38.262
Are you reading what you're saying?

00:39.596 --> 00:41.640
(Paper rustles)

00:43.767 --> 00:45.436
'Yes, I am.

00:45.602 --> 00:51.984
'The only way I can communicate
is to write out everything in advance.'

00:53.193 --> 00:57.906
What if someone asks you
something you haven't anticipated?

01:00.075 --> 01:04.495
'Thank you for your
insightful comments. Goodbye.'

01:04.663 --> 01:06.790
Wait! Sid!

01:07.499 --> 01:12.004
Sid, your insecurity lies
in your fear of making a mistake.

01:12.170 --> 01:17.426
You have to practise. lf you work
at it, you too may achieve...

01:17.592 --> 01:22.639
the command and confidence
to which we all aspire to...

01:22.806 --> 01:24.850
be having.

01:25.551 --> 01:29.972
This is Dr Frasier Crane
wishing you good mental health.

01:32.766 --> 01:37.020
- That was a show good.
- Thank you, Roz.

01:38.647 --> 01:41.567
- Knock, knock.
- What are you doing here?

01:41.733 --> 01:44.945
Want to go to lunch next week
at the Empire Club?

01:45.112 --> 01:48.824
- You know a member?
- No. But you may.

01:48.991 --> 01:51.368
What are you up to?

01:51.535 --> 01:57.874
You had that same look when you found
Flagstad's 1932 "Götterdämmerung".

01:58.917 --> 02:05.674
lf all goes well, my lapel will be sagging
under the weight of a membership pin.

02:05.841 --> 02:12.138
You'll fit in with those blue bloods
who wouldn't even spit on the rest of us.

02:13.223 --> 02:16.101
Don't jinx it. I'm not in yet.

02:18.603 --> 02:23.566
There's still a party where
they screen prospective members.

02:23.733 --> 02:26.611
- How did this come about?
- I thank Maris.

02:26.778 --> 02:32.450
She spent years cultivating
relationships until fortune smiled on us.

02:32.617 --> 02:37.122
Old Judge Clements suffered a stroke
and a vacancy opened up.

02:38.706 --> 02:41.835
Gives new meaning to
"a stroke of luck".

02:43.419 --> 02:47.006
It gets better.
There are actually two vacancies.

02:47.173 --> 02:50.593
Edgar van Cortland
was indicted in a scandal.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.263
Frasier, I think my time has come.

02:53.429 --> 02:56.641
- I'm very happy for you.
- That's generous of you.

02:56.808 --> 02:59.978
Especially as you've dreamed
of a membership.

03:00.144 --> 03:02.814
A lesser man would be jealous.

03:02.981 --> 03:04.941
- You're not?
- No.

03:05.108 --> 03:07.777
- They have a planetarium.
- So?

03:07.944 --> 03:10.238
I think my work here is done.

03:14.617 --> 03:18.037
- So he's getting into the Empire Club?
- It appears so.

03:18.204 --> 03:23.251
He deserves to have lunch
in that private dining room,

03:23.417 --> 03:26.671
read in that fabled mahogany library.

03:26.838 --> 03:29.924
- It's eating you?
- Like a bacteria.

03:31.342 --> 03:33.594
lf he gets in, I should too.

03:33.761 --> 03:38.391
What if I know someone
who could get you invited?

03:38.557 --> 03:43.229
- Don't toy with me.
- Mr Strickland, please. It's Roz.

03:43.396 --> 03:46.315
- Walter Strickland Junior?
- Senior.

03:46.482 --> 03:51.028
- How do you know him?
- The less you know, the better.

03:57.636 --> 03:59.679
I need more comfortable shoes.

03:59.846 --> 04:01.890
My dogs are killing me.

04:02.057 --> 04:05.393
- Pardon?
- My "dogs". My feet.

04:05.560 --> 04:10.940
- What do you call them in England?
- By their rightful names.

04:11.858 --> 04:16.446
Except Uncle Harold. He named
his anatomy after the royal family.

04:17.488 --> 04:21.868
He walked on the Queen's pins,
sat on the Duchess of Kent.

04:22.035 --> 04:23.536
A jolly fellow...

04:23.703 --> 04:29.375
until Aunt Kate caught him introducing
the Prince of Wales to a waitress.

04:31.336 --> 04:33.954
- Are you almost finished?
- Yes, I am.

04:33.955 --> 04:36.750
You'll have the handsomest midriff.

04:36.916 --> 04:41.046
- I hope my date concurs.
- Who are you taking?

04:41.212 --> 04:46.843
Dr Susan Anderson. She's as boring
as toast but a brilliant physician

04:47.010 --> 04:49.888
and socially well-connected.

04:50.055 --> 04:53.475
Isn't Niles a little ticked off?

04:53.641 --> 05:00.064
Yes, but I convinced him if we work
together we'll secure both vacancies.

05:00.231 --> 05:05.612
It's like when you were kids. lf one
has something, the other has to, too.

05:05.778 --> 05:07.197
(Doorbell rings)

05:07.363 --> 05:11.117
I had to buy two Balinese lutes,
two découpage kits,

05:11.284 --> 05:13.620
two pairs of lederhosen.

05:14.370 --> 05:19.042
When you moved out, that was
one embarrassing garage sale.

05:20.376 --> 05:22.420
- Hello, Niles.
- Ready?

05:22.587 --> 05:25.715
- No. Susan's at the hospital.
- Where's Maris?

05:25.882 --> 05:29.302
In the Mercedes
practising her vivacious giggle.

05:30.178 --> 05:35.016
Let's go over our strategy.
I made a crib sheet on each member.

05:36.684 --> 05:41.564
"School ties, business affiliations,
hobbies, mistresses."

05:42.815 --> 05:45.318
I also researched our competition.

05:45.484 --> 05:49.238
Don't worry. One of them flies coach.

05:51.616 --> 05:54.285
We're as good as in. Unless...

05:54.452 --> 05:56.662
I just had a terrifying thought.

05:56.829 --> 06:02.334
What if another candidate
researched the skeletons in our closet?

06:06.964 --> 06:09.508
Damn it!

06:10.426 --> 06:14.680
- That's as bad as it gets.
- I wouldn't be so sure.

06:14.847 --> 06:20.603
They wouldn't look kindly on your
arrest for mooning President Nixon.

06:20.769 --> 06:24.481
I was young and firm
and in love with an anarchist.

06:26.150 --> 06:29.278
That's minor compared
to your suicide attempt.

06:29.445 --> 06:34.283
It was not a legitimate attempt.
I did it to get Lilith's attention.

06:34.450 --> 06:35.993
(Phone rings)

06:36.160 --> 06:40.289
Maris and I should head over.
The others will get a leg up on us.

06:40.456 --> 06:44.251
- Good idea. See you there.
- Bye, Dad.

06:44.418 --> 06:50.132
Hello. Oh, Susan, I've been
expecting you. Are you in the car?

06:50.299 --> 06:54.887
No! You're still at the hospital?
Of course I understand.

06:55.053 --> 06:58.557
You were a sweetheart
to agree to go in the first place.

06:59.808 --> 07:02.269
I'll call you tomorrow.

07:02.436 --> 07:04.479
Fat chance.

07:07.608 --> 07:11.028
- Stood you up?
- This is disastrous.

07:11.194 --> 07:16.742
- Just go stag.
- I'd look like I couldn't find a date.

07:16.908 --> 07:22.289
Why are we worried? We got
a Cinderella right under this roof.

07:22.456 --> 07:27.085
That's the last time I get grout up
without wearing rubber gloves.

07:28.211 --> 07:33.633
I've so much gunk under my nails,
I look like I've been worming a pig.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.095
Trust me, the English accent will sell it.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:47.022 --> 07:52.694
Oh, yes. It's everything
I ever imagined it would be and more.

07:53.945 --> 07:56.448
What's that smell, Dr Crane?

07:57.157 --> 07:59.868
That's power.

08:00.034 --> 08:02.078
Call me Frasier.

08:02.245 --> 08:06.499
People mustn't know you work for me.
We've dated for six months.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.710
All right, Frasier.

08:09.627 --> 08:11.462
Anything else, Frasier?

08:11.629 --> 08:16.259
Are we in love or is this
just a physical thing, Frasier?

08:16.426 --> 08:18.469
Stop that.

08:20.763 --> 08:23.266
Oh, Niles. How goes the chase?

08:23.433 --> 08:26.185
Brilliantly.

08:26.352 --> 08:28.187
Daphne.

08:29.272 --> 08:32.650
- Evening.
- What are you doing here?

08:32.817 --> 08:36.779
Frasier takes me everywhere,
don't you, sweetheart?

08:37.613 --> 08:40.741
I'll go sample some hors d'œuvres.

08:40.908 --> 08:43.578
Back in a minute, darling.

08:44.996 --> 08:47.665
- Darling?
- My date cancelled.

08:47.832 --> 08:51.878
Daphne's filling in.
You think I'd go out with Daphne?

08:52.044 --> 08:54.922
You are a man. She is a goddess,

08:55.089 --> 08:59.176
whose bedroom is only 41 steps
from your own.

08:59.343 --> 09:01.804
Where's Maris?

09:01.971 --> 09:05.224
Apologising to another candidate's wife.

09:05.391 --> 09:09.812
Maris bumped a dish of crabmeat
into the woman's décolletage.

09:11.439 --> 09:15.693
- Accidents will happen.
- As long as the hors d'œuvres flow.

09:18.195 --> 09:20.823
My God. Feel this leather.

09:23.492 --> 09:26.412
I have had pudding stiffer than this.

09:26.579 --> 09:28.998
Frasier, Kenneth Spencer.

09:33.586 --> 09:38.799
I'm sure it was satisfying
being Phi Beta Kappa at Yale,

09:38.966 --> 09:44.013
but surely you would have been
happier at Princeton?

09:44.179 --> 09:46.557
Anyone who's anyone went there.

09:46.724 --> 09:50.477
Excuse me, I'm Kenneth Spencer.

09:50.644 --> 09:53.814
As it happens, I went to Princeton.

09:54.064 --> 09:55.774
No!

09:56.859 --> 09:59.027
What are the odds?

09:59.194 --> 10:04.408
I'm Dr Frasier Crane. My brother,
Dr Niles Crane, the eminent psychiatrist.

10:04.575 --> 10:09.705
He's too kind. He was eminent when
my eminence was merely imminent.

10:14.710 --> 10:17.546
Try this caviar, Frasier.

10:17.713 --> 10:22.551
I met the most charming gentleman,
Edgar van Cortland.

10:22.718 --> 10:25.721
I thought he lost his membership
in a scandal.

10:25.887 --> 10:28.515
He was acquitted
and reinstated into the club.

10:28.682 --> 10:32.018
- Oh, he was innocent.
- No. Just acquitted.

10:36.022 --> 10:38.608
So there's only one membership?

10:38.775 --> 10:43.655
Yes. But if one is selected
you can bring the other as a guest.

10:45.615 --> 10:48.743
lf only one can become a member,
I hope it's you.

10:48.910 --> 10:51.746
- That's noble.
- I know what it means to him.

10:51.913 --> 10:55.250
We can't risk another suicide attempt.

11:00.839 --> 11:06.219
That's amusing, using humour
to defuse a tense situation.

11:06.386 --> 11:10.014
I'm sure that helped
when you were in prison.

11:12.892 --> 11:15.770
- Kenneth.
- Excuse me.

11:15.937 --> 11:17.981
(Arguing)

11:19.357 --> 11:24.570
Stop it! Do you intend to run each other
down and ruin both your chances?

11:27.824 --> 11:29.826
- You're right.
- Thank you.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.078
Cocktails?

11:32.245 --> 11:36.582
Yes. Your best 18-year-old
Lowland single-malt Scotch.

11:36.749 --> 11:41.587
- A discriminating choice.
- He has good knowledge of spirits

11:41.754 --> 11:46.092
from his years shacked up
with a barmaid.

11:53.432 --> 11:56.811
Mum says,
"Why can't I meet your boyfriends?"

11:56.978 --> 12:03.025
I say, "The plane trip takes four hours -
longer than my relationships last."

12:04.527 --> 12:08.698
There's Niles. Don't look at him.
Pretend we don't see him.

12:08.864 --> 12:10.658
Real mature.

12:10.825 --> 12:15.913
Thanks to him I can't say
the phrase I've rehearsed for a lifetime:

12:16.080 --> 12:19.208
"lf you need me, I'll be at my club."

12:20.292 --> 12:24.380
This is so boring.
You owe each other an apology.

12:24.547 --> 12:27.633
Yes, but I apologised first last time.

12:29.218 --> 12:33.347
That means it's his turn.
Goody! I can be mature about this.

12:42.731 --> 12:45.401
- Niles.
- Frasier.

12:45.567 --> 12:48.821
After last night, an apology is in order.

12:48.987 --> 12:51.573
I agree.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.826
Well?

12:53.992 --> 12:57.579
- Well what?
- I apologised first last time.

12:57.746 --> 13:02.251
- No, you didn't.
- I did. After the Monet exhibit.

13:02.417 --> 13:06.046
My secretary left a heartfelt apology
with your service.

13:08.257 --> 13:11.760
So you did. It is my turn again.

13:11.927 --> 13:13.887
Damn!

13:16.390 --> 13:18.809
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

13:18.976 --> 13:21.061
I'm a terrible person.

13:21.228 --> 13:24.564
- We just turned on each other!
- It was embarrassing.

13:24.731 --> 13:30.320
My only excuse is that all my life
I dreamed of belonging to a club.

13:30.487 --> 13:36.368
As a child, when I formed clubs
with my bears, some didn't make it.

13:39.996 --> 13:42.707
Hello. Yes, this is Dr Crane.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.752
It's the club.

13:45.919 --> 13:47.462
Yes?

13:48.547 --> 13:52.467
I see. Thank you for considering me.

13:53.635 --> 13:57.138
lf you'd care to speak to my brother,
he's here.

13:57.305 --> 13:59.182
Be gracious.

14:03.812 --> 14:08.400
Yes, I see.
Thank you very much for calling.

14:08.566 --> 14:10.402
Goodbye.

14:11.694 --> 14:16.616
Don't let it get you down.
We were fine without them before.

14:23.039 --> 14:25.750
We're fine without them, aren't we?

14:28.086 --> 14:31.422
Oh, my God. You got in.

14:35.093 --> 14:37.387
Congratulations.

14:38.513 --> 14:41.766
I'd better go break the news to Maris.

14:42.725 --> 14:49.107
Niles, your getting passed over
drains every drop of joy from this.

14:49.273 --> 14:52.276
Thank you. You're a good brother.

14:54.821 --> 14:58.282
Yes! I got in!

14:58.449 --> 15:01.285
Shout it from the rooftops!
Lattes for everyone!

15:01.452 --> 15:04.455
This is the proudest day of my life!

15:08.793 --> 15:13.089
Of course...
what really matters is family.

15:19.887 --> 15:21.806
Beg.

15:21.972 --> 15:24.600
Come on. We've worked on this.

15:24.767 --> 15:27.937
You can do it. Beg.

15:29.522 --> 15:31.816
Sit.

15:31.982 --> 15:34.235
Good boy!

15:34.401 --> 15:36.987
- What are you doing?
- Teaching him a trick.

15:37.154 --> 15:41.200
- With my imported prosciutto?
- It's worth it.

15:41.367 --> 15:45.329
- Not unless he can sing from "Tosca".
- Where are you going?

15:45.496 --> 15:49.333
The Empire Club.
I've come to a moral decision.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.544
I will insist
they give Niles my membership.

15:52.711 --> 15:54.963
That's a hell of a gesture.

15:55.130 --> 15:58.217
I put myself in Niles' place.

15:58.384 --> 16:02.846
He's spent 15 years trying to climb
Seattle's social ladder.

16:03.013 --> 16:06.850
Then within two years,
I'm known throughout the city

16:07.017 --> 16:10.203
and I grab the prize
he's wanted most of all.

16:10.204 --> 16:12.290
It just isn't fair.

16:12.457 --> 16:16.127
- You're a good kid.
- Thank you, Dad.

16:19.213 --> 16:21.299
I'll say this while I still can...

16:24.510 --> 16:26.721
lf anyone needs me...

16:30.933 --> 16:33.478
...I'll be at my club.

16:34.729 --> 16:39.650
Yes, the club.
The club that I helped you get into.

16:39.817 --> 16:43.529
Now you're done with me,
I'm just cast aside.

16:44.363 --> 16:47.992
Unappreciated, unloved and forgotten.

16:49.035 --> 16:53.622
I see the prosciutto
isn't the only imported ham in the house.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.627
Give me your shirt.
I need a full load.

16:59.962 --> 17:03.424
- Anything white?
- Yeah, but you're not getting them.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.385
(Doorbell)

17:09.387 --> 17:12.808
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne. Dad.

17:12.974 --> 17:14.810
Niles.

17:17.188 --> 17:21.108
Just passed Frasier.
Where was he off to?

17:21.275 --> 17:23.569
He went to the club.

17:26.030 --> 17:28.073
No wonder he was evasive.

17:28.240 --> 17:33.746
I hope you don't mind my stopping by.
I had no place else to go.

17:33.912 --> 17:38.250
Niles, you may get into that club yet.

17:40.294 --> 17:45.340
- What?
- He went to give his spot to you.

17:46.675 --> 17:49.136
Is this a sick joke?

17:49.303 --> 17:53.223
You should be happy.
He's giving up his own membership.

17:53.390 --> 17:56.810
What would I be happy about?
This is humiliating.

17:56.977 --> 17:59.730
My brother going
to make them take me?

17:59.896 --> 18:02.774
His heart's in the right place.

18:02.941 --> 18:07.321
Dad, they made their decision.
I don't want their pity.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.949
I don't care if they invite me now,
even if they BEG!

18:11.992 --> 18:14.619
Good boy!

18:24.045 --> 18:27.048
Excuse me, is the Club President here?

18:27.215 --> 18:29.843
Yes, Mr Drake is over there.

18:30.010 --> 18:31.970
Thank you.

18:38.018 --> 18:39.853
Mr Drake?

18:40.020 --> 18:45.483
- Dr Frasier Crane.
- Yes, of course.

18:45.650 --> 18:48.486
The new blood. Please sit down.

18:48.653 --> 18:52.949
Sir, I've come here on
a matter of personal business.

18:53.908 --> 18:56.703
It's about my brother Niles.

18:56.870 --> 18:59.873
Niles is sort of...

19:01.291 --> 19:05.879
My God. This leather's as soft
as a baby's bottom.

19:06.045 --> 19:10.466
On family night we bring babies in
and do a blindfold comparison test.

19:12.135 --> 19:14.429
That's a joke, Crane.

19:14.596 --> 19:18.099
Yes, indeed. Darn good one too, sir.

19:19.434 --> 19:26.107
My brother may seem priggish but he's
the most discriminating man I know.

19:26.274 --> 19:29.360
You'd be hard-pressed to find
a bigger snob in this room.

19:30.486 --> 19:34.115
Excuse me, sir, a glass of port?

19:35.658 --> 19:40.371
- 1896?
- What are you saying, Crane?

19:40.538 --> 19:43.040
Glad to be aboard, sir.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.604
No, I came down here to say

19:48.605 --> 19:52.901
that my brother deserves
membership more than I do

19:53.067 --> 19:55.570
and I want to step down in his favour.

19:55.737 --> 19:58.948
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

19:59.115 --> 20:02.243
After all, blood is thicker than port.

20:04.579 --> 20:09.125
- I stand corrected.
- Let me be candid with you, Crane.

20:09.292 --> 20:15.631
We were quite firm about accepting
anybody in the entertainment business.

20:15.798 --> 20:19.510
Radio psychiatrist
falls into that category.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.555
Radio psychiatrist? But Niles...

20:24.640 --> 20:27.810
- There's been a mistake.
- No, there hasn't.

20:28.477 --> 20:33.274
Dad said you'd try
to get me in your club. Don't bother.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.777
I don't need you to fight my battles.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.238
- But...
- Butt out.

20:40.156 --> 20:46.078
You've made it clear how you feel,
so I'd like to share how I feel.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.123
I'd sooner spend time
in a bus station

20:49.290 --> 20:52.209
than spend one moment
with you smug bigwigs

20:52.376 --> 20:56.088
with your oriental carpets
and overstuffed chairs...

20:56.255 --> 20:58.757
My God, it's like a baby's bottom!

21:00.759 --> 21:03.512
You can't reject me
because I reject you.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.515
Yes, I'm talking to you, fuzzy.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.853
I prefer being Niles Crane, everyman.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.355
Friend of the average Joe.

21:13.522 --> 21:18.819
Niles, they got our names mixed up.
I didn't get in. You did.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.155
What?

21:23.949 --> 21:26.285
It was you they wanted.

21:26.452 --> 21:30.539
I'm in? Good God, don't just
stand there. Fetch me some port.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.292
Escort these gentlemen out.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.170
You can't think I meant
the things I said.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.464
Excuse me, sir,
I must ask you to leave.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.677
You and who else?

21:47.055 --> 21:50.017
Niles, we don't need this club.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.936
Let us leave with dignity.

21:53.103 --> 21:56.189
No. There's been a misunderstanding.

21:56.356 --> 22:00.277
I could just come part time.
Perhaps just one afternoon.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.238
Thursday's a slow day.

22:03.405 --> 22:07.367
I wouldn't talk to anyone.
I could just sit in a chair.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.829
Please! Let me stay. I belong here!

22:15.292 --> 22:21.172
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:21.339 --> 22:22.424
# Mercy!

22:22.591 --> 22:29.472
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:29.639 --> 22:35.270
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:35.437 --> 22:37.731
# They're calling again #

22:37.897 --> 22:40.066
Frasier has left the building.
