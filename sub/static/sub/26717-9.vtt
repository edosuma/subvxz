00:01.539 --> 00:03.081
Previously on Midnight, Texas

00:03.083 --> 00:05.754
I feel your every emotion
as if it were my own.

00:05.757 --> 00:07.819
There has to be a way
to sever the connection.

00:07.821 --> 00:09.354
If I turn you into a vampire.

00:09.356 --> 00:10.689
What are you?

00:10.691 --> 00:13.024
I'm a demigod. A trickster, to be exact.

00:13.027 --> 00:14.223
I get into human business.

00:14.226 --> 00:16.097
Stir the pot, create some chaos.

00:16.101 --> 00:18.580
- Fiji's pretty far gone.
- I'm not giving up on her.

00:18.582 --> 00:20.332
Nice try.

00:23.807 --> 00:25.203
So sorry..

00:25.206 --> 00:27.206
I'm so sorry.

00:28.760 --> 00:29.921
It's Theophilus.

00:29.924 --> 00:32.343
The founder of the dark magic.

00:32.345 --> 00:33.937
Theophilus... It's Patience's twin.

00:33.940 --> 00:35.911
If they catch you, Patience has everything

00:35.914 --> 00:37.616
she needs to bring Theophilus back.

00:37.618 --> 00:40.051
It's my family, and I
won't let anyone else die.

01:00.307 --> 01:03.674
Manfred, no.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.712
Oh, God!

01:13.860 --> 01:15.459
Yea, though I walk through the valley

01:15.462 --> 01:18.389
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil,

01:18.392 --> 01:20.458
for thou art with me.

01:20.460 --> 01:23.228
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort...

03:11.338 --> 03:13.738
I'm free.

03:13.740 --> 03:15.707
My dear brother!

03:15.709 --> 03:17.876
You've returned to me!

04:05.158 --> 04:06.991
Oh.

04:08.995 --> 04:10.944
Oh, hello.

04:10.947 --> 04:13.598
Hello.

04:24.377 --> 04:27.157
Oh, what is that dreadful smell?

04:28.515 --> 04:32.016
I'm sorry, my dear, but insurrection

04:32.018 --> 04:34.385
will not be tolerated.

04:37.524 --> 04:40.225
Oh, who knew conquering a town

04:40.227 --> 04:42.093
could be so exhausting.

04:42.095 --> 04:44.963
- Mm-hmm
- Could go for a shiatsu.

04:44.965 --> 04:47.799
Shame Kai's not around.

04:47.801 --> 04:49.188
You sure he's dead?

04:49.191 --> 04:50.990
I did a tracking spell.

04:50.993 --> 04:52.436
Didn't pick up a pulse.

04:52.439 --> 04:54.772
Probably offed himself.

04:54.774 --> 04:56.875
I should have known
that coward would buckle

04:56.877 --> 04:59.712
at the first sign of trouble.

04:59.715 --> 05:01.378
Grape.

05:03.206 --> 05:04.873
Go on.

05:09.222 --> 05:13.224
Why must you always
look so bloody miserable?

05:17.764 --> 05:20.031
Oh, much better.

05:22.502 --> 05:25.036
You know, I don't understand

05:25.038 --> 05:26.771
why you don't just kill the Midnighters.

05:26.773 --> 05:29.607
They're only gonna be
a thorn in your side.

05:29.609 --> 05:31.376
- Trust me.
- Mm.

05:31.378 --> 05:34.746
Because they'll be
helpful for phase two.

05:34.748 --> 05:36.188
"Phase two"?

05:36.191 --> 05:39.141
You didn't think I was going
to stop at Midnight, did you?

05:39.144 --> 05:41.818
No, love.

05:41.821 --> 05:44.856
Texas and this whole sad excuse

05:44.858 --> 05:47.625
of a country is only just the beginning.

05:47.627 --> 05:50.295
So... world domination?

05:50.297 --> 05:53.398
Yeah, something like that.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.934
But first, we're going to need

05:55.936 --> 05:59.771
a witch army, and
we're going to build it

05:59.773 --> 06:03.241
using the unlikeliest of allies.

06:16.890 --> 06:18.690
I didn't want to drug you.

06:18.692 --> 06:21.225
You just gave me no choice.

06:21.227 --> 06:24.429
Oh, demon ash.

06:24.431 --> 06:28.099
Such a clever way to sedate
an angel, don't you think?

06:28.101 --> 06:30.009
Well, look at it on the bright side:

06:30.012 --> 06:32.580
At least now you don't have
to figure out what to do

06:32.583 --> 06:35.439
with Chuy's remains.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.415
Oh, Joe.

06:42.418 --> 06:45.182
You were such a good angel.

06:45.185 --> 06:48.086
You served your god

06:48.088 --> 06:49.921
for many millennia,

06:49.923 --> 06:53.091
and now, the one time you need him most,

06:53.093 --> 06:56.160
he is nowhere to be found.

06:57.797 --> 07:01.699
If God really cared
about His precious angels,

07:01.701 --> 07:04.669
would He let this happen to you?

07:10.744 --> 07:13.025
If you pledge your loyalty to me,

07:13.028 --> 07:14.628
I would never desert you.

07:14.631 --> 07:18.448
I would love you unconditionally.

07:18.451 --> 07:21.586
I can make all your pain

07:21.588 --> 07:23.915
and suffering and guilt go away.

07:25.525 --> 07:27.992
Would you like that?

07:32.098 --> 07:33.767
I take that as a "yes."

07:43.739 --> 07:47.040
Captives are to speak
only when spoken to.

07:47.043 --> 07:49.998
Do not attempt to escape.

07:50.001 --> 07:52.950
Do not throw food at the guards.

07:52.952 --> 07:55.134
Witch genocide?

07:55.137 --> 07:56.603
Pretty much.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.755
Patience said with all
the light witches gone,

07:58.758 --> 08:00.553
there'll be no one
strong enough to stop her

08:00.556 --> 08:03.027
and Theophilus from
taking over the world.

08:03.029 --> 08:05.892
Do not damage or deface property,

08:05.895 --> 08:08.529
and do not insult the Queen.

08:08.532 --> 08:12.034
First step to doing that
is killing all the Delilahs?

08:12.037 --> 08:14.170
They're not killing us.

08:14.173 --> 08:16.439
- Addie, you okay?
- No.

08:16.442 --> 08:17.939
They're carving out our butterflies

08:17.942 --> 08:19.308
and taking our souls.

08:19.311 --> 08:21.177
Converting you to dark witches.

08:21.180 --> 08:22.914
That's how they're
building the witch army.

08:22.916 --> 08:25.516
- We need to stop them.
- Well, how?

08:25.518 --> 08:29.253
They're everywhere and
we're trapped in here.

08:29.255 --> 08:30.722
Not for long.

08:30.724 --> 08:32.590
The guards at bath duty
were more interested

08:32.592 --> 08:34.525
in their edible arrangements.

08:34.527 --> 08:36.561
All right, I'll sneak out,

08:36.563 --> 08:38.962
make sure the coast is clear.

08:43.102 --> 08:45.670
Don't die.

08:57.484 --> 08:59.350
Joe.

09:05.859 --> 09:07.992
Are you okay?

09:13.333 --> 09:15.462
You know, I don't have to torture you.

09:15.465 --> 09:17.103
You could learn to listen.

09:17.106 --> 09:18.669
Obey.

09:18.671 --> 09:20.505
Make Midnight great again.

09:22.278 --> 09:24.407
You're going to pay for that.

09:29.516 --> 09:31.482
Sister, stop.

09:31.484 --> 09:33.484
Don't torture her.

09:35.421 --> 09:37.455
Just kill her, already.

09:37.457 --> 09:40.091
You and Fiji both.

09:40.093 --> 09:41.492
I broke the angel.

09:41.494 --> 09:43.161
Surely I can break a mere mortal.

09:43.163 --> 09:45.530
Eye on the prize, my love.

09:45.532 --> 09:49.233
Focus your energy on building the army.

09:49.235 --> 09:52.748
Now that we're together,
nothing can stop us.

10:08.822 --> 10:10.822
It's real bad.

10:20.774 --> 10:23.578
How bad is it?

10:23.580 --> 10:25.346
Nuclear.

10:25.348 --> 10:28.182
Midnight's still chock full of witches,

10:28.184 --> 10:31.286
twins got their powers back, and...

10:31.288 --> 10:33.855
Joe's working for 'em.

10:33.857 --> 10:37.058
- What are you talking about?
- Looks like a spell.

10:37.060 --> 10:40.262
He's some sort of dark angel.

10:42.234 --> 10:43.512
Sorry, Manfred.

10:43.515 --> 10:46.349
Plan didn't work.

10:46.352 --> 10:48.652
Creek died because of me.

10:48.655 --> 10:51.390
This is my town. It's my family.

10:51.393 --> 10:54.161
I won't let anyone else die.

10:54.164 --> 10:55.630
Wait, wait, wait.

10:55.633 --> 10:57.300
There... there might be another way.

10:57.303 --> 10:59.169
Please.

11:02.143 --> 11:04.577
I should take it.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.661
I-I'd have the power to cast a spell

11:06.664 --> 11:08.967
that makes me look just
like you, and that way,

11:08.970 --> 11:11.037
if Patience... If she catches me

11:11.040 --> 11:14.542
trying to get to that painting...

11:14.545 --> 11:16.863
she... she'll cut off my head instead.

11:16.866 --> 11:18.325
Yeah, I can't let you do that.

11:18.328 --> 11:19.872
No, wait... No, you don't get it.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.141
Only your body is strong enough

11:21.144 --> 11:23.122
to survive the ritual, so if Patience...

11:23.125 --> 11:25.311
If she attaches
Theophilus' head to my body,

11:25.314 --> 11:26.907
well, then, maybe, if we're lucky,

11:26.910 --> 11:28.981
it'll be rejected and
all those monster powers,

11:28.984 --> 11:30.161
they'll just be wasted.

11:30.164 --> 11:32.097
Giving us a better shot
at taking out Patience.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.357
Yeah, it's a... it's a built-in
safety net if our plan fails.

11:34.359 --> 11:35.497
How do you know it'll work?

11:35.500 --> 11:38.501
I don't, but it's worth a try.

11:38.504 --> 11:40.903
- You know that means...
- No, I know.

11:40.906 --> 11:43.157
And if I hadn't helped Patience
collect all those vials,

11:43.159 --> 11:45.526
none of this would be happening.

11:45.528 --> 11:47.195
Manfred, I-I don't have a family.

11:47.197 --> 11:48.596
I don't have anyone.

11:48.598 --> 11:50.708
But you do, and you have an obligation

11:50.711 --> 11:52.005
to stay alive for them.

11:52.008 --> 11:54.842
So if anyone else should
have to die, it should be me.

12:13.657 --> 12:16.658
I was wrong about you.

12:16.660 --> 12:19.494
Oh, I know.

12:47.242 --> 12:50.343
I knew it was a Hail Mary.

12:50.346 --> 12:52.465
There was always a chance
that Kai's body would be

12:52.468 --> 12:54.668
strong enough, but now we're worse off

12:54.671 --> 12:57.966
than when we started
and Kai died for nothing.

12:57.969 --> 13:00.036
Not nothing.

13:00.039 --> 13:02.106
He died a hero.

13:07.911 --> 13:10.278
- Where are you going?
- Back to Midnight.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.213
No, hey, hey... that's suicide.

13:12.215 --> 13:13.825
My friends need me.

13:13.828 --> 13:15.361
Thanks for taking me in.

13:15.364 --> 13:19.132
All right, so what's your
plan once you get there?

13:19.135 --> 13:21.089
Figure out another way to free Delilah.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.890
I mean, she stopped
the twins once before,

13:22.892 --> 13:26.861
but there's nothing she can do
trapped inside that painting.

13:26.863 --> 13:28.731
I'm coming with.

13:28.734 --> 13:30.034
Thought you said it was suicide.

13:30.037 --> 13:32.003
Yeah, well, I wouldn't be alive

13:32.006 --> 13:33.387
if it weren't for Joe.

13:33.390 --> 13:35.338
I know he wants nothing
to do with me right now

13:35.341 --> 13:37.755
but I owe a debt to
Midnight all the same.

13:39.895 --> 13:42.028
Come on.

13:44.501 --> 13:46.735
So...

13:46.738 --> 13:49.105
I'm not here for sex?

13:49.108 --> 13:50.676
Nope.

13:50.679 --> 13:52.913
Netflix and chill.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.950
Even dark witches need their downtime.

13:55.953 --> 13:57.519
Well, come on.

13:59.963 --> 14:02.497
Hi, Gary.

14:02.499 --> 14:04.107
I'm here to see Rebecca.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.277
She's not expecting
me, but I thought...

14:06.280 --> 14:08.268
Feel good about what you did?

14:08.271 --> 14:10.371
You happy being Patience's bitch?

14:10.373 --> 14:12.573
Shh.

14:12.575 --> 14:14.308
"Gypsy" is on.

14:17.068 --> 14:20.202
Don't you feel any remorse...

14:20.205 --> 14:22.072
for what you did?

14:22.075 --> 14:24.409
Turning on your friends.

14:24.412 --> 14:26.045
Destroying your town.

14:26.048 --> 14:30.150
I mean, guilt's a useless emotion.

14:30.153 --> 14:32.820
Now, rub my calves.

14:34.192 --> 14:38.198
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

14:38.201 --> 14:41.369
This isn't you, Feej.

14:41.371 --> 14:44.539
This isn't the woman I used to know.

14:44.541 --> 14:48.042
The woman who loved
her friends like family.

14:49.779 --> 14:51.612
The woman...

14:51.614 --> 14:55.216
who would never turn
her back on a good fight.

14:56.986 --> 14:58.753
The woman...

14:58.755 --> 15:01.537
who was willing to sacrifice her soul

15:01.540 --> 15:04.263
to save my life.

15:08.104 --> 15:10.138
And we can get there again.

15:10.141 --> 15:12.441
Yeah?

15:12.444 --> 15:14.978
But hey, hey. Hey.

15:14.981 --> 15:18.282
You have to come back to me.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.719
You're my soul mate.

15:29.305 --> 15:31.918
You thought that would work?

15:31.921 --> 15:33.888
Ooh, you're dumber than I thought.

15:33.890 --> 15:36.424
Move.

15:51.526 --> 15:54.860
Oh.

15:57.547 --> 15:59.580
- Mm.
- See?

15:59.582 --> 16:02.016
Conversion therapy does work.

16:02.018 --> 16:04.785
Maybe we should take
more cues from the church.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.560
Darling, what's the matter?

16:10.563 --> 16:13.760
What the bloody hell?

16:13.763 --> 16:16.697
Oh, don't worry, my... my love.

16:16.699 --> 16:19.066
The 21st century has something called

16:19.068 --> 16:22.169
"dental hygiene."

16:24.607 --> 16:28.242
Manfred's body was supposed
to be the perfect vessel.

16:28.244 --> 16:30.444
You didn't do the wrong
binding spell, did you?

16:30.446 --> 16:33.214
Of course not, and I used your grimoire.

16:33.216 --> 16:36.017
I'm sure it's nothing.

16:45.193 --> 16:47.843
It's all right. It's all right.

16:52.149 --> 16:53.615
My brother is sick.

16:53.617 --> 16:55.884
- Heal him.
- No.

16:55.886 --> 16:57.419
I want to see my wife.

16:57.421 --> 16:59.221
I'm the one making the demands.

16:59.223 --> 17:01.890
You don't have a choice.

17:06.363 --> 17:08.763
Give my brother your
blood or I'll stake you

17:08.766 --> 17:11.133
and take it myself.

17:11.135 --> 17:13.234
Only if I can see Olivia.

17:13.237 --> 17:16.238
I need to know she's okay.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.406
Fine. If it'll shut you up.

17:18.409 --> 17:20.876
You heal my brother and
I'll give you two minutes

17:20.877 --> 17:23.111
with your precious Olivia.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.435
All right.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.718
Open wide, my darling.

17:46.203 --> 17:48.437
Oh, rejoice.

17:48.439 --> 17:51.940
My dear brother, you are healed.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.811
I did what you asked.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.279
Now let me see my wife.

17:57.281 --> 17:59.748
Not only can you see her,

17:59.750 --> 18:02.284
you can say good-bye.

18:04.955 --> 18:07.623
They're gonna burn me
at the stake tonight.

18:16.166 --> 18:17.557
We've only got two minutes.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.102
I'm gonna get you out of here.

18:20.104 --> 18:21.217
How?

18:21.220 --> 18:24.238
- There's witches everywhere.
- I'll find a way.

18:24.241 --> 18:26.341
You don't get it.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.451
It's over.

18:33.317 --> 18:35.717
Olivia, this isn't you.

18:35.719 --> 18:38.286
You never give up without a fight.

18:38.288 --> 18:41.156
There's nothing left to fight for.

18:42.559 --> 18:45.560
The town I love doesn't exist anymore.

18:46.764 --> 18:49.931
And I would rather die...

18:49.933 --> 18:53.201
than live in Patience, Texas.

18:53.203 --> 18:55.103
Don't say that.

18:56.507 --> 18:58.707
We can take on anything.

18:58.709 --> 19:00.776
Even this.

19:00.778 --> 19:03.745
I'm sorry, Lem.

19:03.747 --> 19:06.548
I love you.

19:08.886 --> 19:12.454
But you have to learn to
admit when you've lost.

19:17.094 --> 19:18.660
Time's up.

19:23.435 --> 19:26.468
- I love you.
- I love you.

19:29.306 --> 19:31.440
God, that smells good.

19:31.442 --> 19:33.775
- Is that...
- Pepperoni.

19:36.246 --> 19:38.513
Hey, Basil.

19:38.515 --> 19:40.749
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey!

19:40.751 --> 19:43.118
- What are you doing here?
- Booboo, isn't it?

19:43.120 --> 19:44.519
- Bobo.
- Oh, right.

19:44.521 --> 19:46.388
Because that makes more sense.

19:46.390 --> 19:47.917
No, I'm here to see the show.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.891
You know how I love me some drama.

19:49.893 --> 19:52.861
Although I am disappointed.

19:52.863 --> 19:55.163
I thought you Midnighters
would put up more of a fight.

19:55.165 --> 19:57.165
Then help us out.

19:57.167 --> 19:58.867
I mean, you could do
something, can't you?

19:58.869 --> 20:01.269
Shoot, you're a demigod.

20:01.271 --> 20:03.271
I'm flattered, really,

20:03.273 --> 20:05.774
but, uh, even I'm not powerful enough

20:05.776 --> 20:07.042
to take on the incest twins.

20:07.044 --> 20:08.112
Oh.

20:08.115 --> 20:10.345
Then tip the scales.

20:10.347 --> 20:12.047
You help us,

20:12.049 --> 20:14.149
oh, we will give you a show to remember.

20:14.151 --> 20:15.349
Fiji lost her soul.

20:15.352 --> 20:17.252
You help us get it back,

20:17.255 --> 20:20.020
that should be a fair fight.

20:20.023 --> 20:21.523
I like the way you think,

20:21.525 --> 20:24.326
but there's a fixed
number of souls on Earth.

20:24.328 --> 20:26.628
I mean, I can't go
around creating new ones

20:26.630 --> 20:28.163
out of thin air.

20:29.666 --> 20:32.234
But I could steal one.

20:32.236 --> 20:33.869
Soul for a soul.

20:33.871 --> 20:35.437
It's just the way the cheese melts.

20:35.439 --> 20:38.473
- Then you take mine.
- Oh, that's cute.

20:38.475 --> 20:40.475
Very "knight in shining...

20:40.477 --> 20:42.110
Henley."

20:42.112 --> 20:44.746
But I'm afraid that's not how it works.

20:44.748 --> 20:47.282
I'd have to take one from someone...

20:47.284 --> 20:49.217
you've never met.

20:49.219 --> 20:51.086
Total stranger.

20:51.088 --> 20:54.018
- Don't do it.
- Who invited Gladys Kravitz?

20:54.021 --> 20:56.591
Do not negotiate with the pizza boy.

20:56.593 --> 20:59.224
It's a trick. He's
literally a trickster.

20:59.227 --> 21:01.628
I'm serious, Bobo, if
you make a deal with him,

21:01.631 --> 21:04.032
one way or another, it's
gonna come back to haunt you.

21:04.034 --> 21:06.234
Everyone, outside.

21:06.236 --> 21:09.371
You change your mind, order
our Margherita pizza...

21:11.108 --> 21:12.941
Extra basil.

21:37.501 --> 21:40.669
Followers. Friends.

21:40.671 --> 21:42.571
Foes.

21:42.573 --> 21:45.674
Tonight, you will witness
what happens to those

21:45.676 --> 21:49.578
who are not loyal to
their new King and Queen.

22:12.569 --> 22:14.769
- Not my queen.
- Manfred?

22:14.771 --> 22:16.538
How are you alive?

22:16.540 --> 22:18.540
You got the wrong body, bitch.

22:19.977 --> 22:22.477
What is this?

22:22.479 --> 22:25.224
Why can't we move?

22:25.227 --> 22:26.717
Brick dust.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.449
Evil can't cross it.

22:28.452 --> 22:30.852
Go! Run! Go!

22:30.854 --> 22:33.154
We're gonna get y'all out of here.

22:35.325 --> 22:37.325
Begone!

22:40.264 --> 22:42.564
No!

22:42.566 --> 22:44.666
No! Theo, no, no, no!

22:44.668 --> 22:47.002
Get the van.

22:47.004 --> 22:48.603
Do something!

22:48.605 --> 22:50.305
Damn it!

22:52.665 --> 22:55.276
Fiji, don't.

22:55.279 --> 22:56.878
Fiji, stop!

23:02.152 --> 23:04.786
Olivia, no!

23:15.639 --> 23:18.295
Lem, do something!

23:18.298 --> 23:21.632
You have to learn to
admit when you've lost.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.707
I'm not giving up.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.976
There is a way out.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.764
Get in!

23:55.902 --> 23:57.335
Nice work.

23:57.337 --> 23:58.809
How'd you get past Joe?

23:58.812 --> 24:01.104
Iron works on him now that he's dark.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.242
Hurry up, let's go.

24:07.246 --> 24:11.048
If Manfred is alive,
then whose body is this?

24:12.952 --> 24:15.019
Kai...

24:15.021 --> 24:18.222
Oh, my God.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.890
Fiji was right.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.193
Kai is dead, but by trying

24:22.195 --> 24:24.295
to thwart me.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.848
And now it might be too
late to do the spell again!

24:27.851 --> 24:29.533
Not to worry, darling.

24:29.535 --> 24:32.203
Maybe it doesn't matter
whose body I have.

24:32.205 --> 24:35.373
You said Kai was powerful.

24:37.577 --> 24:40.644
I'm sure his body will do just fine.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.914
Really, I'm feeling better already.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.983
Good.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.718
Oh.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.070
Oh...

25:09.742 --> 25:13.077
- Theophilus isn't well.
- How do you know?

25:13.079 --> 25:14.844
When Patience fed him my blood...

25:14.847 --> 25:16.614
She didn't know we'd forge

25:16.616 --> 25:17.748
a psychic connection.

25:17.750 --> 25:21.252
I can tell he's weak and afraid.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.020
Then this is our chance to strike.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.089
We've gotta get Delilah out

25:25.091 --> 25:26.590
of the painting.

25:26.592 --> 25:30.928
You'll never defeat her, you idiots!

25:30.930 --> 25:35.766
That spell's too strong,
you're never gonna break it!

25:46.279 --> 25:48.112
Is it working?

25:50.483 --> 25:51.615
No.

25:51.617 --> 25:53.017
Whatever spell is on this painting,

25:53.019 --> 25:55.619
it's way too powerful.

25:55.621 --> 25:58.189
I need help from another witch.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.826
Me?

26:01.828 --> 26:04.161
You want me to help you?

26:15.641 --> 26:19.810
Hello, I'd like to
order a Margherita pizza.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.979
Extra basil.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.148
Seriously?

26:28.187 --> 26:30.721
How's that for 30 minutes or less?

26:32.692 --> 26:34.325
Peeky-boo.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.662
Dumpster fire, hi.

26:40.833 --> 26:44.268
What do we have here?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.837
Oh, pointy.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.342
I'm ready to make a deal.

26:51.344 --> 26:54.778
Steal Fiji a soul...

26:54.780 --> 26:57.848
as long as it's someone we never met.

26:57.850 --> 27:00.251
Swear on my immortal life.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.258
Yeah.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.861
Pleasure doing business.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.151
Bobo?

27:34.153 --> 27:36.253
What just happened?

27:40.326 --> 27:42.893
You came back to me.

27:46.566 --> 27:49.633
I can't even look at you guys.

27:49.635 --> 27:52.136
What I did...

27:52.138 --> 27:55.472
What I put you through...

27:55.474 --> 27:57.808
There aren't enough ways to say sorry.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.510
Feej, we get it.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.478
No good deed...

28:01.480 --> 28:03.414
You tried saving Bobo.

28:03.416 --> 28:05.416
And you turned into a huge dick.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.454
I've been there.

28:07.457 --> 28:09.019
We all have.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.822
And there'll be plenty of time
for apologies, but right now,

28:11.824 --> 28:15.793
what we need is your help, okay?

28:19.265 --> 28:22.199
Do you know the "Intus" incantation?

28:22.201 --> 28:23.767
I-I do.

28:23.769 --> 28:26.804
Then let's jailbreak us a witch.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.347
It's working.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.238
It's working!

29:38.643 --> 29:40.910
Your stupid spell's not gonna work.

29:40.912 --> 29:43.479
You had one shot and you blew it.

29:43.481 --> 29:45.981
Well, you're dead either way.

29:58.996 --> 30:01.931
You have got to be kidding me!

30:01.933 --> 30:05.034
Hello, Hypatia.

30:07.838 --> 30:11.840
Looks like things are
finally coming to a head.

30:11.842 --> 30:14.243
Joe!

30:17.444 --> 30:19.010
Joe!

30:19.013 --> 30:21.950
Joe, help me! Please!

30:41.739 --> 30:43.639
Fiji, look out!

30:51.482 --> 30:53.792
No!

30:53.956 --> 30:55.549
No!

31:03.077 --> 31:04.943
Trapped in a painting

31:04.946 --> 31:07.247
with only possum to eat.

31:07.250 --> 31:10.017
Being hunted day and night

31:10.020 --> 31:12.100
for 800 years!

31:12.103 --> 31:13.802
You put me

31:13.804 --> 31:16.438
through literal hell!

31:20.244 --> 31:22.444
You want to talk about hell?

31:22.446 --> 31:24.413
Try smuggling a head in a cage

31:24.415 --> 31:26.438
through TSA!

31:33.858 --> 31:37.032
Give me my body!

31:59.183 --> 32:02.117
No!

32:03.888 --> 32:06.792
I know you're in there, Joe!

32:06.795 --> 32:09.991
No!

32:09.994 --> 32:12.861
Go, all right?

32:12.863 --> 32:16.365
This is between me and Joe.

32:47.198 --> 32:49.765
Jesus.

32:49.767 --> 32:53.102
She's absorbing the powers.

32:57.675 --> 33:00.275
Seventy times seven beasts.

33:07.918 --> 33:09.257
- O...
- M...

33:09.260 --> 33:12.120
G.

33:25.081 --> 33:26.435
Delilah!

33:31.976 --> 33:34.810
She's too strong.

33:34.812 --> 33:36.879
Delilah.

33:41.218 --> 33:43.752
Kai... Kai, if you're still in there,

33:43.754 --> 33:46.155
now's the time to help.

33:55.733 --> 33:58.500
I love you, Joe!

33:58.502 --> 33:59.812
You have to believe that.

33:59.815 --> 34:01.451
You know what it's like
to have to kill someone

34:01.453 --> 34:02.938
that you love. Don't you dare make me

34:02.940 --> 34:04.476
have to do that to you.

34:33.370 --> 34:36.304
No, no, no.

34:38.876 --> 34:41.376
No!

34:50.020 --> 34:52.688
Into the woods I cast thee

34:52.690 --> 34:55.690
for all eternity.

35:17.681 --> 35:19.882
Thank you.

35:19.884 --> 35:22.718
Be at peace, brother.

35:45.605 --> 35:48.573
- Hi.
- Look at them.

35:48.575 --> 35:50.942
One day they're enslaved by dark witches

35:50.944 --> 35:53.178
and the next they're digging in

35:53.180 --> 35:57.115
to country fried steak
like nothing happened.

35:57.117 --> 36:00.251
Amnesia spell.

36:00.253 --> 36:04.022
You're welcome.

36:04.024 --> 36:07.392
Dinner is served.

36:07.394 --> 36:08.436
Oh.

36:08.439 --> 36:10.999
First cartoon saloon, now home-cooking.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.531
Thank you.

36:13.533 --> 36:16.201
- Manny.
- Looks good.

36:16.203 --> 36:17.702
You're gonna own this town.

36:17.704 --> 36:19.637
Oh, well, that's the plan.

36:19.639 --> 36:21.773
Thinking about calling it...

36:21.775 --> 36:24.075
Bobo, Texas.

36:24.077 --> 36:27.178
Way too soon.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.538
Is Delilah gonna be joining us?

36:32.541 --> 36:35.520
No, she left this morning.

36:35.522 --> 36:38.056
She's got some butterflies to catch.

36:39.459 --> 36:40.859
To Delilah.

36:40.861 --> 36:42.994
And to, um... To all our friends

36:42.996 --> 36:45.964
who don't have the luxury of being here.

36:55.978 --> 36:57.375
Yeah.

37:32.174 --> 37:34.205
Welcome to Midnight.

37:41.421 --> 37:42.787
Ready for bed?

37:42.789 --> 37:45.022
Not even close.

37:45.025 --> 37:48.159
It's all so...

37:48.161 --> 37:49.627
overwhelming.

37:49.629 --> 37:51.663
Like, day is night,

37:51.665 --> 37:54.732
night is day, and...

37:54.734 --> 37:57.101
I could eat an entire cow.

37:59.339 --> 38:00.772
Alive.

38:02.442 --> 38:04.642
I know it's not easy, but...

38:04.644 --> 38:07.211
I can show you a way to live peacefully

38:07.213 --> 38:10.682
till you manage the hunger.

38:10.684 --> 38:12.884
The blood lust.

38:18.425 --> 38:20.400
You know, I never thought

38:20.403 --> 38:23.527
I would say this, but...

38:23.530 --> 38:26.798
Eternity doesn't scare me anymore.

38:28.601 --> 38:31.402
So, um...

38:31.404 --> 38:33.905
no regrets?

38:33.907 --> 38:37.342
For the first time in my life...

38:37.344 --> 38:39.010
none.

38:41.982 --> 38:44.082
Hey. Just checking in.

38:44.084 --> 38:47.143
See how you're holding up.

38:47.146 --> 38:48.572
You going somewhere?

38:48.575 --> 38:51.788
Yeah, um, there's something I gotta do.

38:54.094 --> 38:57.095
I killed Addie.

38:57.097 --> 38:59.764
When an angel kills an innocent,

38:59.766 --> 39:01.666
it violates a cardinal rule of heaven.

39:01.668 --> 39:03.444
Look, you were under Patience's spell.

39:03.447 --> 39:06.404
- You didn't have a choice.
- There's always a choice.

39:08.608 --> 39:10.508
So now I have to go redeem myself

39:10.510 --> 39:11.776
in the eyes of God.

39:11.778 --> 39:14.645
What... what do you have to do?

39:14.647 --> 39:16.381
I don't know.

39:16.383 --> 39:18.683
It's not up to me.

39:18.685 --> 39:21.652
While I'm gone, I need
you to watch over Midnight.

39:21.654 --> 39:23.521
I won't be around patrolling.

39:23.523 --> 39:26.557
Joe, uh, I don't...

39:26.559 --> 39:28.359
You can.

39:28.361 --> 39:31.729
You saved this town twice now, Manfred.

39:33.433 --> 39:35.900
You're its protector.

39:40.006 --> 39:41.973
Hi.

39:44.978 --> 39:47.445
What's that smile?

39:52.986 --> 39:54.919
We're expecting.

39:58.958 --> 40:01.759
- You're kidding.
- No.

40:01.761 --> 40:03.327
Oh, baby.

40:03.329 --> 40:06.164
Oh, Feej.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.735
This is the most magical thing
that's ever happened to us.

40:13.740 --> 40:16.541
- And that's saying a lot.
- Yeah, I know.

40:16.543 --> 40:18.810
I can't believe it.

40:18.812 --> 40:22.447
There's a little someone
living inside of me.

40:22.449 --> 40:26.084
I know we've never met him or her yet,

40:26.086 --> 40:29.754
but I am already in love.

40:31.391 --> 40:34.125
I'm ready to make a deal.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.294
Steal Fiji's soul...

40:36.296 --> 40:39.063
as long as it's from
someone we've never met.

41:03.523 --> 41:05.423
Grandma?

41:05.425 --> 41:07.692
Is... is this a dream?

41:10.029 --> 41:12.497
I-I'm not imagining you again, am I?

41:12.499 --> 41:13.598
No.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.099
This time, I'm real.

41:15.101 --> 41:17.034
It was a bitch crossing over,

41:17.036 --> 41:19.837
but I had to come warn you.

41:22.575 --> 41:25.610
You're really in trouble now, Manny.
