00:01.000 --> 00:03.103
- I did some math.
It's gonna cost about 40,000

00:03.136 --> 00:04.338
to get this place fixed up.
- Dollars?

00:04.371 --> 00:05.339
- Leah known somebody
at the church.

00:05.372 --> 00:06.707
- Oh hell no.
- Hello!

00:06.740 --> 00:08.575
- You the one that was
messing around with my wife.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.444
- That was over 50 years ago.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.346
- 'Cause that's the night
I got even with you anyway.

00:12.379 --> 00:14.381
- What?
- You kissed my girl,

00:14.414 --> 00:16.683
and I slept with yours!
- Ee.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.485
- Remember that hippo you was
messing 'round with?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.420
Six-foot six all the way around.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.122
- Ain't nobody
like that but Mabel.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.624
- That's her name.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.659
- A few months later, Madea came
and told me she was pregnant.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.628
- Oh hell, no.
- And you look just like

00:27.661 --> 00:27.728
my daughter Cora.
- No, I don't!

00:30.839 --> 00:32.408
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:32.441 --> 00:35.578
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. What?

00:37.513 --> 00:39.515
- You look just like her.
- Ooh!

00:39.548 --> 00:41.383
What are you saying?

00:41.417 --> 00:45.354
- I'm saying you might
be the baby daddy.

00:45.387 --> 00:46.855
- What are you
talking about, man?

00:46.889 --> 00:48.490
- That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

00:48.524 --> 00:50.526
- Okay, let me explain to you.

00:50.559 --> 00:52.828
- Mabel told me that I was
Cora daddy,

00:52.861 --> 00:55.297
so I took care of Cora
like I was Cora daddy.

00:55.331 --> 00:58.334
So then, I had--started
giving her $14

00:58.367 --> 01:01.370
of my Social Security
for child support.

01:01.403 --> 01:04.373
Then, Mabel say, "We gonna go
on 'The Maury Povich Show.'"

01:04.406 --> 01:07.576
So she came out on there,
"Uuuh, uuuh," like that.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.612
And Maury, he came with
the envelope,

01:09.645 --> 01:12.348
he say,
"You are not the father."

01:14.950 --> 01:17.186
Okay, tell me what
you and Mabel did.

01:17.219 --> 01:18.554
- Now you don't
know what sex is?

01:18.587 --> 01:20.389
I tapped that bitch fat ass.

01:22.925 --> 01:25.427
- I don't be doing no tapping.

01:25.461 --> 01:28.464
- Hold on a minute, hold
on a minute, hold on.

01:28.497 --> 01:30.199
Sh--let me see
your tapping again.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.402
- Why you keep doing
it with your finger?

01:33.435 --> 01:34.436
Trying to make fun of me?

01:34.470 --> 01:38.674
- No, I--I just seen
your tap, so I did my tap.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.609
- You gonna try to make fun
of a man with a hook

01:40.643 --> 01:41.443
and just do--do like that?

01:41.477 --> 01:43.312
That what the hell
you trying to do?

01:43.345 --> 01:45.948
- I--I didn't do
it with your girl.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.284
- You're lying.
You slept with her.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.218
- I ain't do no love.

01:49.251 --> 01:51.320
I ain't sleep with nobody,
I'm a Christian.

01:52.988 --> 01:56.558
- Christian hell, you
tapped that Christian ass.

01:58.761 --> 02:02.298
- First of all, Mabel
ain't no Christian.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.566
- Right about that.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.269
- And second of all,
it was one time.

02:07.303 --> 02:10.271
And I was drunk,
and she took advantage of me.

02:10.306 --> 02:14.376
- And third of
all--one, two, three...

02:14.410 --> 02:16.845
you tapped that ass.

02:16.879 --> 02:19.315
- Did you just count
the hook as three?

02:19.348 --> 02:20.816
- One, two, three.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.485
- Anyway, none of that matters.

02:23.519 --> 02:28.290
I've been having nightmares ever
since Mabel did love to me.

02:28.324 --> 02:29.725
- Who is Mabel?

02:29.758 --> 02:31.594
- Oh, Mabel is
a great, big old woman.

02:31.627 --> 02:34.263
They call her Madea.

02:34.296 --> 02:35.731
- Mr. Brown, that's not nice.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.266
- Oh, don't be offensed.

02:37.299 --> 02:40.669
If you'd seen her,
you'd be like, "Golly!"

02:40.703 --> 02:41.870
- Yeah, he ain't
lying about that.

02:41.904 --> 02:46.342
She about 634--634.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.876
- And her waist is about--

02:47.910 --> 02:49.745
probably 'bout
the size of this room.

02:49.778 --> 02:50.779
- Huge woman.

02:50.813 --> 02:52.915
And thought she was sexy.

02:52.948 --> 02:54.583
Just all in your face with it.

02:54.617 --> 02:55.818
- You should see her thighs.

02:55.851 --> 02:58.287
They big like somebody done
attacked her with golf balls,

02:58.320 --> 02:59.622
hail damage everywhere.

02:59.655 --> 03:02.024
- Oh my God, they
just big and huge.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.360
And they're hard as hell to keep
up in the air.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.695
I mean, I had 'em on my back,
and I was trying to lift 'em up,

03:06.729 --> 03:07.997
and they was bringing me down.
And--

03:08.030 --> 03:09.465
- Okay, alright!
Okay, that's--that's enough.

03:09.498 --> 03:11.367
That's enough!

03:11.400 --> 03:12.735
- You get the picture.
Don't you?

03:12.768 --> 03:14.036
- Mm.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.404
- I don't think

03:15.437 --> 03:17.673
- Oh, yes--yes, I do.

03:17.706 --> 03:18.874
I don't wanna get it no more.

03:19.975 --> 03:21.010
- Well, I'm just trying
to help,

03:21.043 --> 03:22.177
that's all.
- [doorbell rings]

03:22.177 --> 03:23.979
- Well, I don't need no
picture, 'cause here she is.

03:24.013 --> 03:25.814
This all the proof
I need right here.

03:25.848 --> 03:28.284

- What?

03:28.317 --> 03:29.785

- What?

03:29.818 --> 03:30.953
- Say hi.

03:30.986 --> 03:31.120

04:12.519 --> 04:14.488

I was in a good mood

04:14.521 --> 04:17.290

04:36.410 --> 04:37.944
One at a time.

Are there any adults

04:39.946 --> 04:41.415
- Yes!
- Yes!

04:41.448 --> 04:42.716

growner man than you.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.454
- What really--what's

04:47.487 --> 04:49.623
- We don't--we don't know.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.892
- Look, all we know
is my grandfather said

04:51.925 --> 04:53.827
your daddy kissed
my grandmother,

04:53.860 --> 04:55.862
then he slept
with some big, tall woman--

04:55.896 --> 04:58.565
- Said she had like golf
balls just in her legs.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.367
- JEREMY: A hippo or something.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.903
- --big ol' thighs, and
he couldn't get her hooks up.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.872
- Wait, okay, hold on, wait,
wait, excuse me, I'm sorry.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.442
Are you--I know y'all not

05:08.475 --> 05:09.810
- Oh, we're sorry.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.545
We just repeating
what they said.

05:11.578 --> 05:12.712
- Mr. Brown, what's going on?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.047
- Cora, I hate
to tell you this.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.416
- What?
- But your mama is a charlatan.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.953
- Do you even know
what that mean?

05:19.986 --> 05:22.656
- Of course. If I say stuff
I know what stuff mean.

05:22.689 --> 05:23.590
- Well, what is it?

05:23.623 --> 05:26.460
- She a thot.
- What?

05:26.493 --> 05:28.729
- A thing humans
ought not touch.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.031
Cora, look it up.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.999
That's the Bible.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.568
- That is not what that mean.

05:34.601 --> 05:35.869
- What does thot mean then?

05:35.902 --> 05:37.637
- They gonna tell you.
Tell 'em what that mean.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.740
- Um...

05:39.773 --> 05:40.874
- That's because
you don't know.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.743
- I--

05:42.776 --> 05:43.877
I do know what it mean.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.011
Tell him what it mean.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.914
- It mean that ho over there.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.116
Don't look around.
Ain't nobody coming.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.418
Ho right there.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.820
You ain't gonna find
him. They right there.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.921
- Now wait a minute now.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.723
Hold on, y'all not gonna be
talking about my mama

05:56.757 --> 05:58.625
like that, and she's not here
to defend herself.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.594
- Cora, your mama could probably
defend herself

06:00.627 --> 06:03.663
right where she's sitting
in her living room.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.500
She could defend herself
from North Korea.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.667
- What do you mean?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.803
- Blou.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.905
She can fart and
blow up there, Cora.

06:11.938 --> 06:15.642
Her fart like nuclear missiles.

06:15.675 --> 06:18.478
She let out some of them nuclear
gas farts and kill us all.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.180
- Okay, that's enough now.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.982
- Your mama used to go
in the bathroom in my house

06:22.015 --> 06:23.517
and my house was next door.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.886
I could smell her from
her bathroom into my house.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.421
I was wondering why all these
birds

06:27.454 --> 06:28.722
kept flying out the window.
- Now--

06:28.755 --> 06:32.959
- One time we had a whole bunch
of dead locusts on our grass.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.528
She had done killed
everything in--

06:34.561 --> 06:36.029
- Would you stop that, please?

06:37.631 --> 06:40.033
- Cora, say hi to your daddy.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.068
- I'm not her daddy.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.636
- That man is not my daddy.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.738
- Nah, nah, he said he
wanted to get revenge,

06:44.771 --> 06:46.873
so he kissed your mama.

06:46.907 --> 06:47.974
- He--he kissed my mama?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.543
- I know, Cora.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.680
It make me--it make me wanna
throw up every time I...

06:53.713 --> 06:56.016
think--did I
have corn or something?

06:56.049 --> 06:57.784
- Oh my.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.821
- Mr. Brown. You kissed
her too, didn't you?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.889
- Cora, you know
the story about that.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.959
She hit me in the head, drug
me in the car by one leg

07:05.992 --> 07:08.795
and just--she did love to me.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.898
She say, "Say my
name, say my name."

07:11.932 --> 07:13.767
"Mabel!"

07:16.703 --> 07:21.108
All I seen was these two giant
things coming down on my face.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.477
And all of the sudden
I said, "Got milk?"

07:26.079 --> 07:27.714
- You're not gonna be talking
about my mama

07:27.748 --> 07:29.516
like that, Mr. Brown.
That's enough.

07:29.549 --> 07:30.317
- Now tell her.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.785
- No, I ain't got
nothing to say.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.053
- Oh--

07:33.086 --> 07:34.788
you will when Dana get here.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.324
- Who in the hell is Dana?

07:37.324 --> 07:39.760
- D-N-A, and you taking
a pregnancy test.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.865
- You cannot be that stupid.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.633
- Are you gonna take a test?

07:46.666 --> 07:50.804
- And you gonna take this foot
all up in you're a--

07:50.837 --> 07:52.005
behind.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.510
I'm not taking no test.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.078
- You--yes, you
taking one today.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.646
- No, I'm not taking no test.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.014
- He is not my daddy.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.282
- But, Cora, I'm
trying to tell you--

08:02.282 --> 08:03.717
- Why are you doing this?

08:03.750 --> 08:05.285
- 'Cause if this
man could be your daddy,

08:05.285 --> 08:06.620
wouldn't you wanna know?

08:06.653 --> 08:09.089
- Mr. Brown, you have
been a father to me.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.957
And that's all I need.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.193
- [sniffs]

08:14.294 --> 08:15.996
Mm, Cora...

08:16.029 --> 08:17.864
that's so sweet, but--

08:17.898 --> 08:19.900
- Well, thank you, Mr. Brown.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.935
Now can we talk about
why we're really here?

08:21.968 --> 08:23.603
- No, I'm gonna
go call your mama.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.638
- Why?

08:24.671 --> 08:25.739
- 'Cause I wanna
know the truth.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.575
- There's no way that random
man could be my daddy.

08:28.608 --> 08:29.910
- Cora, look at him.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.578
- Well, wait--you
'bout to pop my neck.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.014
What you--
- Look, Cora!

08:36.582 --> 08:39.686
- I don't look like him.
- Okay. Squint your eyes.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.054
Squint your eyes.

08:44.224 --> 08:48.695
If you was this color,
Cora, y'all'd be twins.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.297
- Would--would you stop it?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.733
You 'bout to smother-cate me.
I can't breathe like that.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.534
- It's smother-rate.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.771
You know I'm telling the truth.

08:57.804 --> 08:58.872
- You are not
telling the truth.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.607
I do not look like that man.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.708
Now, calm down.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.778
- [heavy breath]

09:04.811 --> 09:06.079
- I'm sorry, Leah.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.048
So, you guys want us to
invest in this place?

09:08.081 --> 09:09.282
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, we do.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.285
- Okay. So, do y'all mind if we
just take a look around?

09:12.285 --> 09:14.287
- Nah, nah, go ahead, take it.
- Okay.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.522
- Would you like
us to show you?

09:15.555 --> 09:19.159
- No, just let us go alone, and
then I can get him to calm down.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.628
- Calm down? You ain't gotta
instruct me to do nothing.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.066
I ain't got to do nothing
but stay black and die.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.070
- Well, you already black.
When your ass gonna die?

09:30.103 --> 09:31.772
- Would you stop
all this cussing?

09:31.805 --> 09:34.674
- And that--that's
your real daddy.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.043
- That is not my damn daughter!

09:37.077 --> 09:39.946
- I'm not gonna tell you
to stop cussing again, man.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.649
- What you gonna do?

09:42.682 --> 09:45.719
You gonna pray for me?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.621
- Yes, I have been
known to do that.

09:47.654 --> 09:48.855
Lay hands.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.625
- That's cold. That is cold.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.026
That is really cold.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.063
- Cora, he talking about--you
have to lay hand on him.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.268
- Just come on. Let's just go.
- Where we going?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.903
- Okay, the kitchen is that way.
- Okay.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.638
- We have some rooms on
this side of the house.

10:04.671 --> 10:05.839
- Alright, alright. Come
on, come on, let's go.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.107
- You go!

10:07.140 --> 10:08.809
You look like him from
the back, too, Cora.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.178
You all walking like him.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.913
- I hope he didn't
ruin it for us.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.282
- The hell you
blame that on me for?

10:15.315 --> 10:16.983
- You don't see
what you just did?

10:17.017 --> 10:19.719
- He came here messing with me.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.155
- What?

10:22.189 --> 10:24.958
- I mean, I don't
want no more children.

10:24.991 --> 10:27.194
- Pop, that woman
ain't no child.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.130
- I'm just saying, son,
if she is my child,

10:30.163 --> 10:34.935
she lay claim to all of this.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.837
All this could be hers.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.405
She'd take it from me.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.973
We won't have it.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.308
- Alright, calm down.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.344
- Boy, how in the hell am
I supposed to calm down?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.079
I had one child.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.714
And that was
your ugly-ass daddy.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.249
- Grandpa!

10:49.249 --> 10:51.885
- You know, and I swore for
God I'd never have another one.

10:51.918 --> 10:55.255
I did. Man, I had it wrapped up
so many times...

10:55.288 --> 10:59.025
I couldn't even feel nothing.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.328
I put duct tape around it.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.463
- Uh.
- Super glue,

11:03.497 --> 11:05.899
and I'd go in.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.734
- That doesn't sound like
that feel good at all.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.069
- At all.
- It didn't feel good at all.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.470
But I was safe.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.938
- [chuckles]

11:11.972 --> 11:14.074
- Never had a disease...

11:14.107 --> 11:16.910
or a baby either.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.845
- Okay, alright, we get it.

11:18.879 --> 11:24.718
- I was so relieved when your
daddy got struck by lightning.

11:24.751 --> 11:25.986
Ooh, I was so relieved.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.354
He was fishing.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.790
He caught a big-ass fish, right?

11:29.823 --> 11:32.859
And when he died, we
went in and got that fish.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.796
The lightning cooked it right
there,

11:35.829 --> 11:38.365
and we put hot sauce on the fish
and ate it.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.768
Left your damn daddy sitting
there.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.370
- You told me my daddy
died in the line of duty.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.505
Stop.
- No, no, no, son.

11:45.539 --> 11:51.111
What I said was: your daddy
died getting some booty.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.246
- I--I can't believe you
saying this to me right now.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.848
I'm--I'm not going for that.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.349
- You need to believe it.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.486
- Alright, well, listen, this
what you need to believe.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.122
There's no way in the world that
woman in there is your daughter.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.991
- Well, I had to confess,

12:05.025 --> 12:08.261
I--I did sleep with the tree.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.363
- Ooh.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.865
- What tree?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.900
- The weeping willow.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.036
Big, more like a big oak.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.006
I had to get a ladder
to get on top.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.443
But it was pretty good, though.

12:23.477 --> 12:24.778
- Okay.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.380
- It was also very confusing.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.282
- How so, Grandpa, tell me?

12:29.282 --> 12:33.420
- There, it all started
with her braids.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.322
They wasn't on her head.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.357
- Euuh!
- Oh my, uh...

12:37.390 --> 12:40.293
- And she had
beads on 'em, too.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.362
- Oh, alright,
okay. That's enough.

12:42.396 --> 12:44.364
- [laughs]

12:44.398 --> 12:46.366
- Grandpa Vinny, how
'bout we run a timeline?

12:46.400 --> 12:48.368
We can dispel all of this.

12:48.402 --> 12:52.239
- Well, you know what? I
think my memory's fading.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.475
- I need you to remember just
what you need to, okay?

12:55.509 --> 12:58.812
- I--sometimes, I can remember
things, and then sometimes

12:58.845 --> 13:02.082
I forget things I don't wanna
remember in the first place.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.520
- Nah, nah, you know what, baby?
That's a good idea.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.455
- Okay.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.925
What was the date?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.894
- Well, let's see, uh...

13:16.263 --> 13:17.564
I don't remember.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.300
- Um...

13:20.333 --> 13:21.268
you remember.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.838
You said it was, uh, uh, 1966.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.006
- That's what he said.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.277
1966, that's right. I mean, she
looks to be about that age.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.045
- Yep.
And you know what else?

13:32.079 --> 13:33.914
- Hm?
- She look like my aunt Hazel.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.115
- Does she?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.050
- Yep, let me find a
picture. Let me see.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.453
- Boy, don't you do that, don't
you show her that damn picture.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.121
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.856
- Look.

13:42.889 --> 13:47.094
- [gasps] She does.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.463
- I know. I really miss
my aunt Hazel, man.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.497
She was so cool.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.265
Real sweet. Real sweet.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.167
And she was the
peacemaker in the family.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.435
And you know we
needed it with this--

13:55.469 --> 13:57.637
- Whatever.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.306
- But you know what I
miss the most about her?

13:59.339 --> 14:00.540
She could blow.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.642
She had a beautiful,
beautiful voice.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.177
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

14:04.211 --> 14:10.117
- CORA: [humming]

14:13.386 --> 14:16.156
- Wow.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.024
- Ah, she sound just
like my aunt Hazel.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.526
- VINNY: No, hell no.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.496
She sound flat to me.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.965
She could never sing
with Kirk Franklin.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.600
God littlest's Christian.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.934
- Ooh. Mm.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.170
- You can wear him
around your neck.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.338
"Glory, glory."

14:31.371 --> 14:33.340
- ♪

14:33.373 --> 14:33.440
- For real?
- Ignore him.

14:36.526 --> 14:41.030
- ♪

14:41.063 --> 14:42.431
- Cora, oven don't work.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.902
'Frigerator nasty, got stuff
growing in it.

14:45.935 --> 14:47.670
- Oh, we could just clean that
up, ain't nothing wrong it.

14:47.703 --> 14:48.738
We just clean this all up.

14:48.771 --> 14:50.773
I got a good--I could see
it, I could see it now.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.074
- You clean it up.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.509
- This place is nice.

14:53.543 --> 14:55.511
You got to just look
beyond what you see--

14:55.545 --> 14:57.980
- Cora, I don't like it.

14:58.014 --> 14:59.515
- Why not?

14:59.549 --> 15:02.919
- 'Cause your--your daddy.

15:02.952 --> 15:05.354
- That man is not my daddy.

15:05.388 --> 15:07.056
- Children don't really
know who they daddy is.

15:07.089 --> 15:09.025
- Yes, I do know who my--
- The only way they know

15:09.058 --> 15:10.860
if they mama tell
'em who the daddy is.

15:10.893 --> 15:12.795
But they don't know for sure.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.497
Especially if they mama
was like your mama.

15:14.530 --> 15:16.499
- Would you stop
talking about my mama?

15:16.532 --> 15:18.468
- You know how many men
she had at her house?

15:18.501 --> 15:19.502
- Look, now!

15:19.535 --> 15:20.670
- She was like a doorbell.

15:20.703 --> 15:21.971
- Would you stop that?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.673
- You press it, something open.

15:23.706 --> 15:25.708
Wooh.

15:25.741 --> 15:28.778
Cora, your mama was
like a doorknob.

15:28.811 --> 15:29.579
- Enough is enough.

15:29.612 --> 15:32.482
- Everybody got a turn.
- You--

15:32.515 --> 15:35.084
- Cora, your mama was
like peanut butter.

15:35.117 --> 15:36.052
- Would you stop?

15:36.085 --> 15:38.087
- An easy spread.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.457
Cora, your mama was like Hawaii.

15:41.491 --> 15:43.526
- I'm gonna spray you in
your mouth if you don't stop.

15:43.559 --> 15:44.961
- Everybody got a lei.

15:46.429 --> 15:47.997
- It wouldn't even work.
Stop talking about mama.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.565
She's not here to defend
herself.

15:49.599 --> 15:51.067
- Just it, Cora.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.836
- And Madea would have told me
if that was my daddy or not.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.905
- No, she wouldn't have ya.
- Yes, she would have.

15:55.938 --> 15:57.640
- You know I'm
telling the truth.

15:57.673 --> 15:59.108
- Listen, listen,
stop it, Mr. Brown.

15:59.142 --> 16:00.576
- Okay.

16:00.610 --> 16:02.111
- This place could be amazing.

16:02.145 --> 16:03.579
- Cora, no. No, it couldn't.

16:03.613 --> 16:04.647
- Yes, it could.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.549
This could be a
great investment.

16:06.582 --> 16:08.851
- And that's the same thing
your mama used to tell men.

16:10.119 --> 16:11.754
"This could be a
great investment."

16:11.787 --> 16:14.790
- I want you--[laughing]

16:14.824 --> 16:15.858
You know what?

16:15.892 --> 16:17.593
I'm laughing, but
that's not funny.

16:17.627 --> 16:19.495
- You laughing
'cause it is funny.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.064
- Okay, you gonna just
keep this up, Mr. Brown?

16:22.098 --> 16:23.900
- Okay, I'm sorry, Cora.
- Well, this place--look,

16:23.933 --> 16:25.635
it could be a great investment
for you.

16:25.668 --> 16:27.069
- Cora, I don't
need no investment.

16:27.103 --> 16:28.738
- Yes, you do need an
investment, Mr. Brown.

16:28.771 --> 16:30.773
You getting old, your
income is not enough.

16:30.807 --> 16:32.475
- Cora, you know this place
could probably be

16:32.508 --> 16:33.743
a big ol' headache.

16:33.776 --> 16:35.545
- No, it would not be a
headache, Mr. Brown. I--

16:35.578 --> 16:37.780
- And what was all that
I saw in the backyard?

16:37.814 --> 16:39.749
- I don't know, just look like
a bunch of plants or something

16:39.782 --> 16:41.450
that just need to be cut down,
that's all.

16:41.484 --> 16:43.553
- Well, I'm gonna have to
bring my lawnmower if we do it.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.488
- Well, I think that's
a good idea, Mr. Brown.

16:45.521 --> 16:47.723
But I think you should
get in on this deal.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.893
- That's the same
thing your mama said.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.763
"Get in on this deal."

16:53.796 --> 16:55.965
- Mr. Brown, no,
seriously. Now stop playing.

16:55.998 --> 16:57.233
Concentrate.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.801
- How much money
they talking, Cora?

16:58.835 --> 17:00.069
- I don't know. They didn't
tell--we didn't

17:00.102 --> 17:01.537
talk about the money yet,
but how 'bout--

17:01.571 --> 17:05.007
- That's the same
thing your mama said.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.675
Cora, I don't know
if I can do it.

17:06.709 --> 17:09.744
- I think you could--
should consider it.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.048
- You think she's
thinking about it?

17:12.080 --> 17:13.683
- She look kinda happy.

17:13.715 --> 17:16.051
- Yeah, kinda like
your aunt, uh, uh--

17:16.085 --> 17:17.053
- Hazel.
- Yeah.

17:17.086 --> 17:18.654
- I don't wanna hear that.

17:18.688 --> 17:20.723
I don't wanna hear that at all.

17:20.756 --> 17:22.592
- This is a good business idea.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.660
And I think you could make
some good money by it.

17:24.694 --> 17:27.096
- Well, fine. I just wanna see
if he your daddy.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.932
- That would be
crazy, Mr. Brown.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.234
- Well, I'm calling your mama.

17:31.267 --> 17:34.003
- For what? For
her to cuss you out?

17:34.036 --> 17:36.072
- You got a point.

17:36.105 --> 17:39.342
- But she might tell
me...in between her cussing.

17:39.342 --> 17:41.043
- Mr. Brown, she's not
gonna tell you anything,

17:41.077 --> 17:42.678
so don't--don't call her.

17:42.712 --> 17:43.813
- Cora?
- Hmm?

17:43.846 --> 17:45.481
- You look like Bill Clinton.

17:47.717 --> 17:49.185
- Come on, let's just
go talk about the money.

17:49.218 --> 17:50.953
- Now we gotta get the
ex-president tested.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.022
- Would you just come on, we
not worrying about all that.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.794
- Alright, well,
we looked around.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.595
- Okay. What you think?

17:59.629 --> 18:00.997
- Well, it needs a lot of work.

18:01.030 --> 18:04.267
- You--you have to
see the beauty of it.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.235
- Well, we do, and we like it.

18:06.269 --> 18:07.770
- We?

18:08.838 --> 18:11.707
You speak for yourself.
Ain't nobody French in here.

18:11.741 --> 18:12.942
- Mister--
- Oui-oui.

18:12.975 --> 18:14.010
- Mr. Brown.

18:14.043 --> 18:15.711
- No, it's you-you.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.215
- So, what is the offer?

18:19.248 --> 18:22.652
- I mean, we thinking it's
gonna cost probably like $40,000

18:22.685 --> 18:24.086
to get this place fixed up.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.556
- Okay, okay.

18:26.589 --> 18:28.658
- And that's what we'll
need for 40% of the company.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.159
- Okay.
- So it's a good investment.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.294
- What?

18:31.394 --> 18:33.029
Cora, let's go.
- Mr. Brown--

18:33.062 --> 18:34.230
- But I did--did I
say something wrong?

18:34.263 --> 18:38.334
- Yes, $40,000!

18:38.334 --> 18:39.335
- Look, I'm sorry.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.571
- Cora, he said, $40,000.

18:41.604 --> 18:42.805
- Yes, I heard him.

18:42.839 --> 18:45.007
- This place ain't
worth $40,000.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.645
This place ain't worth $4.

18:49.679 --> 18:50.646
- Mr. Brown, stop it.

18:50.680 --> 18:54.784
- Well, Cora, where
am I gonna get $40,000?

18:54.817 --> 18:57.253
- You gonna get it from in
your sock under your mattress.

18:59.655 --> 19:01.891
- Cora, what you telling
these people my business for?

19:01.924 --> 19:04.627
- Well, I--
- They could be robbers.

19:04.660 --> 19:05.995
Look at him right there.

19:06.028 --> 19:08.798
He look like he could steal.

19:08.831 --> 19:10.066
I bet you he could
pick a lock, Cora.

19:10.099 --> 19:13.102
He just put that thing--and he
hook around--come around and--
