00:01.043 --> 00:02.360
Previously on <i>Bones...</i>

00:02.362 --> 00:03.695
<i>There's a hacker named</i>

00:03.730 --> 00:05.498
Christopher Pelant.
Where are you?

00:05.532 --> 00:07.400
Pretty much anywhere
I want to be.

00:07.434 --> 00:09.101
This guy's killed how many people?
Eight.

00:09.136 --> 00:10.636
<i>This guy is worse than anyone</i>

00:10.671 --> 00:12.371
<i>you and I</i>
<i>have ever come across.</i>

00:12.406 --> 00:14.140
And he told you that if you
married Temperance, that

00:14.174 --> 00:16.943
<i>he would choose five random</i>
<i>human beings and kill them?</i>

00:16.977 --> 00:19.111
<i>Not only if I married</i>
<i>Bones but if I told her</i>

00:19.146 --> 00:21.013
why we couldn't get married.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.584
What kind of
flower is that?

00:24.618 --> 00:25.885
It's a marigold.

00:25.919 --> 00:27.553
What's that mean?
Pain and grief.

00:27.588 --> 00:28.721
Christopher Pelant,

00:28.755 --> 00:30.056
<i>you are under arrest.</i>

00:30.090 --> 00:31.924
We have nothing on him.
So Pelant wins?

00:31.959 --> 00:33.559
<i>Yes, today</i>

00:33.594 --> 00:34.961
Pelant wins.

00:35.529 --> 00:36.929
Down!

00:38.131 --> 00:39.732
<i>Been looking for this guy</i>

00:39.766 --> 00:41.367
for three months,
and I got nothing.

00:41.401 --> 00:42.501
<i>It's a complete dead end.</i>

00:42.536 --> 00:44.036
Pelant's laughing
at us right now.

00:44.071 --> 00:45.805
The key will be to tie Pelant
to the murders specifically.

00:46.773 --> 00:48.274
<i>Pelant is still out there.</i>

00:48.308 --> 00:51.077
<i>We're still waiting for him</i>
<i>to make the next move.</i>

00:56.850 --> 00:58.818
Hey, I-I love
the closeness, sweetie,

00:58.852 --> 01:00.653
but isn't there something else
you could be doing?

01:00.687 --> 01:02.255
Just want to make sure
the shield works.

01:02.289 --> 01:04.757
Yeah, well, I've set up
a trident sub's worth

01:04.791 --> 01:06.325
of microwave-emitting
jammers.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.641
There is no way that Pelant
is hacking through this thing.

01:08.662 --> 01:09.695
Hey, Sweets,

01:09.730 --> 01:12.131
what are you doing here?
Thought you were on leave.

01:12.132 --> 01:14.567
Well, this whole idea
started with me.

01:14.601 --> 01:16.469
Pelant thinks he's
smarter than all of us,

01:16.503 --> 01:18.104
which might be true,

01:18.138 --> 01:21.440
but he's not smarter
than all of us put together.

01:21.475 --> 01:22.842
Hey, is this
the guy?

01:22.876 --> 01:25.111
Yes.

01:28.982 --> 01:33.653
Late 30s, excellent dentition,
good tone.

01:33.687 --> 01:35.922
His name was Donald Hestnes.

01:35.956 --> 01:37.423
Yeah, what happened
to him?

01:37.457 --> 01:38.991
Coronary occlusion.

01:39.026 --> 01:40.526
Fortunately
he had willed his body

01:40.560 --> 01:42.361
to the Jeffersonian.

01:42.396 --> 01:44.263
Somehow I don't think this is
quite what he had in mind.

01:44.298 --> 01:45.331
Do you object
to our plan,

01:45.365 --> 01:46.399
Ms. Julian?

01:46.433 --> 01:48.567
Legally it passes muster, as the
deceased donated

01:48.602 --> 01:50.202
his body to science.

01:50.237 --> 01:54.674
That being said, what you're
doing gives me the chills.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.108
The situation necessitates it.

01:56.143 --> 01:57.410
Pelant's fundamental
personality structure is

01:57.444 --> 02:01.047
psychopathic
with extreme narcissism

02:01.081 --> 02:02.214
that demands an audience.
Less shrinky, <i>cher.</i>

02:02.249 --> 02:03.616
He won't be able

02:03.650 --> 02:05.217
to tolerate someone else
stealing his spotlight.

02:05.252 --> 02:06.485
We're going to smoke him out.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.787
I, uh,

02:07.821 --> 02:11.557
conceptualized
a copycat body drop.

02:11.591 --> 02:13.225
Pelant usually goes
for the baroque,

02:13.260 --> 02:15.061
so I modeled it
after a painting

02:15.095 --> 02:16.629
by Salvator Rosa.

02:16.663 --> 02:18.564
The punishment
of Prometheus.

02:18.598 --> 02:21.300
He was bound to a rock
and his liver was torn out

02:21.335 --> 02:23.369
- by a giant eagle.
- That body may not be

02:23.403 --> 02:25.237
sufficiently degraded
for us to get the call.

02:25.272 --> 02:27.974
I already took care
of that.

02:29.242 --> 02:31.243
Aw, Angie,

02:31.278 --> 02:32.645
that is brilliant.

02:32.679 --> 02:34.447
Yeah, I kind of
hate it.

02:34.481 --> 02:36.248
We'd better get
to it.

04:11.244 --> 04:12.311
Lovely.

04:12.345 --> 04:14.246
Makes me want

04:14.281 --> 04:15.581
You may hate it,

04:15.615 --> 04:17.116
but it is amazing.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.819
Let's hope
it worth it.

04:46.546 --> 04:47.746
Nobody followed you?
No, don't worry.

04:47.781 --> 04:49.014
I doubled back, like, five times

04:49.049 --> 04:50.916
to make sure no one tailed me.

04:50.951 --> 04:53.352
Where do I
deliver the body?

04:53.386 --> 04:55.788
Back entrance to the Jackson,
uh, Arboretum, all right?

04:55.822 --> 04:58.224
There's no night security
there since the sequester.

04:58.258 --> 04:59.358
What's my window?

04:59.392 --> 05:01.293
Five hours all in.

05:01.328 --> 05:05.264
I know you don't like this idea.
Yeah.

05:05.298 --> 05:07.900
You've been hunting Pelant
for months on your own.

05:07.934 --> 05:09.094
Yeah, and I've gotten
nowhere,

05:09.102 --> 05:10.369
so I got to try
something new here.

05:10.403 --> 05:11.570
But you don't like it.

05:11.605 --> 05:12.738
Yeah, I don't like it.

05:15.609 --> 05:17.543
Pelant put me

05:17.577 --> 05:20.479
behind a desk
for the rest of my career.

05:20.514 --> 05:21.947
I appreciate you giving me
this chance

05:21.982 --> 05:24.717
to catch the bastard.

05:28.388 --> 05:31.123
Wow, that's-- wow.

05:31.158 --> 05:33.125
It was actually a
fascinating exercise.

05:33.160 --> 05:37.563
Do you know this is the first
time I've burned a human bone?

05:37.597 --> 05:38.764
Not the right tone, Bones.

05:38.798 --> 05:40.299
- Oh, yeah.
- So, the body

05:40.333 --> 05:41.767
has to be displayed
on this big boulder

05:41.801 --> 05:44.637
at the entrance to
the fern grotto.

05:44.671 --> 05:47.206
According to the myth,
Prometheus' torment began

05:47.240 --> 05:49.108
each day with
the rising sun,

05:49.142 --> 05:51.277
so the skull needs
to face the east.

05:51.311 --> 05:52.545
You got it.

05:52.579 --> 05:54.680
Presentation is vital. Deviate
even slightly, and Pelant will know

05:54.714 --> 05:56.782
we're setting him up.
All right.

05:56.816 --> 05:58.217
Well, I'm not about
to argue with a woman

05:58.251 --> 05:59.451
who can solve a murder

05:59.486 --> 06:01.086
using only a tooth
and a magnifying glass.

06:01.121 --> 06:04.456
I have solved a murder
using only a tooth,

06:04.491 --> 06:07.860
but I used significantly
more sophisticated equipment

06:07.894 --> 06:09.361
than a magnifying glass.

06:09.396 --> 06:10.930
I'll do it exactly
the way you said.

06:10.964 --> 06:13.098
Well, Flynn's motivated,
he'll get it done.

06:14.901 --> 06:17.036
Five hours, Flynn.

06:22.342 --> 06:23.742
I won't forget this, Booth.

06:23.777 --> 06:25.778
You're doing me a big favor.

06:33.653 --> 06:35.821
Do you wish
you were going with him?

06:35.855 --> 06:38.991
I wish I'd killed Pelant
three months ago.

06:39.025 --> 06:41.760
It'd be better
to catch him alive.

06:41.795 --> 06:43.896
Better for who?

06:53.340 --> 06:56.842
I wish the call
would come in.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.244
We could have sex.
Huh?

06:58.278 --> 06:59.678
Well, our bodies need
to relieve tension

06:59.713 --> 07:00.913
so we can sleep.

07:00.947 --> 07:02.248
Oh, way to take
the romance out of it.

07:02.282 --> 07:03.916
Well, I'm just
being practical.

07:03.950 --> 07:07.586
I just know I always sleep
best after several orgasms.

07:07.621 --> 07:10.055
Okay, what, is that
some kind of a challenge?

07:10.090 --> 07:12.658
Maybe.

07:17.564 --> 07:18.931
Flynn?

07:18.965 --> 07:19.932
No, FBI.

07:19.966 --> 07:21.333
They found the body.

07:33.113 --> 07:35.047
- Police responded to a call...
- Okay, so what do we got?

07:35.081 --> 07:38.817
The remains were found by
a dog walker one hour ago.

07:38.852 --> 07:40.519
She called it
in to Metro.

07:40.553 --> 07:41.520
Poor woman will have
nightmares

07:41.554 --> 07:43.122
for the rest
of her life.

07:43.156 --> 07:44.790
Well, we can't fake
everything. Time of death?

07:44.824 --> 07:47.426
Blowfly larvae indicate
ten hours ago.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.395
The extent of the evisceration

07:49.429 --> 07:50.696
and the manner

07:50.730 --> 07:52.698
in which the body
is bound indicate

07:52.732 --> 07:53.999
a retelling
of the Prometh...

07:54.034 --> 07:56.969
Oh, God.

07:57.003 --> 07:58.437
A flower.

07:58.471 --> 08:01.240
It's not us?

08:01.274 --> 08:02.408
Oh, no.

08:02.442 --> 08:04.209
Hodgins, do you know?

08:04.244 --> 08:06.979
Yeah, it's, it's a monkshood.

08:07.013 --> 08:08.981
Means "A foe is near."

08:09.015 --> 08:10.783
This is a message
from Pelant.

08:10.817 --> 08:11.917
He's telling us
we didn't fool him.

08:11.951 --> 08:13.118
It's worse than that.

08:13.153 --> 08:16.388
What?
This isn't our body.

08:16.423 --> 08:17.656
What?
Are you sure?

08:17.691 --> 08:20.159
This victim
has remodeled fractures

08:20.193 --> 08:22.861
on the third and fourth
left ribs and both clavicles.

08:22.896 --> 08:24.997
Come on, come on, come on.

08:25.031 --> 08:27.466
This remodeling wasn't
in our corpse.

08:27.500 --> 08:31.036
It suggests bullet wounds
that are less than a year old.

08:31.071 --> 08:33.205
It's Flynn.
Well, how do you know?

08:33.239 --> 08:35.374
He took those bullets for me.
I know those wounds.

08:35.408 --> 08:36.842
Hi, this is Flynn.

08:36.876 --> 08:38.811
If you're listening to this
instead of talking to me,

08:38.845 --> 08:41.080
I must have
a really good reason.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.893
Oh, my God.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.696
You all right?

09:57.730 --> 09:59.097
There are

09:59.131 --> 10:00.298
no defensive wounds.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.101
Pelant has used
injectable anesthetic

10:03.135 --> 10:05.670
to immobilize victims
in the past.

10:05.705 --> 10:06.838
Well, I'll, uh,

10:06.873 --> 10:09.875
run a tox screen
to confirm.

10:09.909 --> 10:11.710
Kerf marks on the sternum
congruent

10:11.744 --> 10:13.945
with a manual
bone saw.

10:15.047 --> 10:19.184
Striae indicate
32 passes were made.

10:19.218 --> 10:22.087
32 passes-- is that
one of Pelant's ticks?

10:22.121 --> 10:23.588
No,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.323
it's one of mine.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.426
He mirrored my technique.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.861
Why?

10:29.896 --> 10:31.963
Be-Because he's trying

10:31.998 --> 10:33.565
to get under your skin.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.100
I'll swab for particulates.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.501
Pelant does not leave
particulates.

10:36.536 --> 10:37.903
Well, someday he'll
make a mistake.

10:37.937 --> 10:39.271
I just hope I'm the
one that catches it.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.705
Oh, God.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.608
There are clamp marks
on the hepatic artery.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.945
What, what does that mean?

10:46.979 --> 10:49.848
What does that mean?

10:49.882 --> 10:51.349
Tell me.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.185
My guess-- it was so he
could keep Flynn alive

10:54.220 --> 10:55.987
while he removed
his liver.

10:56.022 --> 10:58.523
Like Prometheus.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.026
He's telling us that
this is our fault.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.328
But it's not.
We were trying to piss him off.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.597
Well, we succeeded,
and we got Flynn killed.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.532
<i>We</i> did not kill
Hayes Flynn; Pelant did.

11:07.567 --> 11:10.335
Now, the only thing we can do
is try to catch Pelant,

11:10.369 --> 11:13.738
- using the evidence in front of us.
- Well, what if we don't?

11:13.773 --> 11:15.974
What if this
just goes on forever?

11:16.008 --> 11:19.878
It won't. In fact, I almost
feel sorry for Pelant.

11:19.912 --> 11:21.346
What?

11:21.380 --> 11:23.715
He killed someone who
saved Booth's life.

11:23.749 --> 11:27.519
Cam's right;
Booth will never give up.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.826
Look, I don't need that
right now, okay, Aldo?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.128
I have more important stuff
to deal with, you understand?

11:37.163 --> 11:38.697
I'm a bartender,
not a priest.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.166
You want to talk, you
got to buy a drink.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.201
Fine. Here.

11:43.235 --> 11:46.771
There's your money.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.374
It's not your fault
the guy died.

11:49.408 --> 11:50.909
Look, I went
along with the plan.

11:50.943 --> 11:52.911
I didn't like the plan
but I went along with it,

11:52.945 --> 11:54.212
and a good guy died from it.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.548
I absolve you of your sin.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.817
You think this was my fault?

11:58.851 --> 12:00.552
I do not, but you do.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.420
Now, how did psycho
killer find out?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.389
I don't know.
I mean, we thought

12:04.423 --> 12:06.291
that he couldn't hear us
or see us,

12:06.325 --> 12:07.559
but obviously we were wrong.

12:07.593 --> 12:09.027
Or somebody told him.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.363
Not me, because I
didn't know about it.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.998
So who does that leave?

12:14.266 --> 12:16.668
People I trust with my life.

12:16.702 --> 12:19.771
And maybe the guy
who got killed?

12:23.843 --> 12:27.879
<i>Okay, let's take this</i>
<i>place apart, all right?</i>

12:27.913 --> 12:29.881
Pelant had eyes on Flynn--
we're not leaving

12:29.915 --> 12:32.235
until we find them.
Booth, I know you didn't like the plan,

12:32.251 --> 12:35.620
and since it was my plan...
You know what, Sweets?

12:35.655 --> 12:37.155
It was a good plan, okay?

12:37.189 --> 12:40.125
What went wrong after
was not your fault.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.459
Thank you.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.662
So, how do you think
Pelant found out?

12:43.696 --> 12:45.630
Like he always does-- he hacked
a phone or planted a bug.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.433
I had another idea.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.467
What's that?

12:49.502 --> 12:51.703
Flynn.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.071
That's not possible.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.074
All right.
Have you been here before?

12:56.108 --> 12:57.342
Yeah, a couple times.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.943
And does anything
look different?

12:58.978 --> 13:01.146
Not really. Ever since
his divorce, he didn't really

13:01.180 --> 13:02.847
care much about stuff.

13:02.882 --> 13:06.618
It looks like he was trying
to come to grips with something.

13:06.652 --> 13:08.887
Look, Sweets, Flynn was a hero
who got shot to pieces, okay?

13:08.921 --> 13:11.322
He's lucky that he survived.
They put him behind his desk

13:11.357 --> 13:14.426
to end his career-- so yeah, he
was coming to grips with stuff.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.494
Check out <i>all</i>
the power sources, okay?

13:16.529 --> 13:18.463
And look for any
kind of transmitter.

13:18.497 --> 13:21.466
And what if there
isn't any, Booth?

13:21.500 --> 13:23.234
Will you suspect Flynn then?
No, I won't, Sweets.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.370
I'll just figure that
Pelant got here before us

13:25.404 --> 13:27.772
and he removed it, okay?
So take a look around,

13:27.807 --> 13:29.307
and if you see
anything strange

13:29.341 --> 13:31.609
or out of the ordinary,
just tell me.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.819
I looked at the swabs
from Flynn's body

13:40.853 --> 13:42.987
with polarized light microscopy,

13:43.022 --> 13:44.956
energy-dispersive X-rays
and mass spectrometer.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.791
I found a few spores

13:46.826 --> 13:49.661
from the arboretum, but that
would be just plain weird not to.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.259
I got nothing that points us
anywhere else.

13:51.260 --> 13:53.242
Pelant isn't working
from the arboretum.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.365
No, no.

13:54.366 --> 13:56.434
I-It's too public, you know?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.236
He needs privacy.

13:58.270 --> 14:01.673
The absence of evidence
is in itself evidence.

14:01.707 --> 14:04.275
That's right.
Yeah, as well as privacy,

14:04.310 --> 14:06.144
Pelant needs
a sterile environment

14:06.178 --> 14:09.681
with air filtration,
a power supply,

14:09.715 --> 14:11.282
soundproofing.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.384
You know, Angela
can map up a...

14:13.419 --> 14:15.153
a radius...
Cool, great.

14:15.187 --> 14:18.456
We're gonna get right on that.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.325
What is <i>that?</i>

14:20.359 --> 14:22.727
Flynn's clavicle was fractured

14:22.762 --> 14:25.463
by a bullet,
surgically repaired,

14:25.498 --> 14:29.667
then a pin was inserted
after it started to set.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.536
Isn't that standard?
If the pin

14:31.570 --> 14:33.738
is made from steel
or titanium.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.074
This pin is made
from artificial bone,

14:36.108 --> 14:38.810
an extremely
expensive procedure.

14:38.844 --> 14:43.148
I don't see how Hayes Flynn
could afford this.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.789
Okay, look, Flynn had some,
uh, expensive surgery done

14:50.823 --> 14:52.357
after the shooting.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.259
How expensive?
Too expensive for him.

14:54.293 --> 14:55.972
Even if he lived like
this to save money?

14:55.997 --> 14:57.195
We're talking about,

14:57.196 --> 14:59.297
like, rich-aunt money--
he didn't have a rich aunt.

14:59.331 --> 15:00.612
So, did you get
anything off the books?

15:00.637 --> 15:01.966
All in all,
they are appropriate to

15:01.967 --> 15:04.903
someone whose life has been
changed by a huge trauma.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.105
Obviously, forgiveness...

15:07.139 --> 15:10.475
is something that he
was struggling with.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.310
You think maybe Pelant
paid for his surgery?

15:12.344 --> 15:13.665
Sweets...
Booth, just hear me out.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.314
What if Flynn's
forgiveness obsession

15:16.348 --> 15:18.349
was actually an effort
to come to grips

15:18.384 --> 15:19.584
with Pelant helping him?

15:19.618 --> 15:22.387
Did you come up
with anything useful?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.857
- No.
- You need to see this.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.360
Agent Booth?

15:32.331 --> 15:35.200
Fake passports,
credit cards, cash.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.701
Yeah, Sweets, I get it.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.270
That's getaway stash.

15:47.827 --> 15:49.728
Look, how do we know that
Pelant didn't set up Flynn?

15:49.762 --> 15:52.082
It's called "preponderance
of evidence," <i>cher.</i>

15:52.083 --> 15:53.784
Expensive surgery,
wads of cash...

15:53.818 --> 15:56.153
You know what, he manipulates
evidence all the time, okay?

15:56.187 --> 15:58.155
Look what he did to <i>you,</i>
Caroline.

15:58.189 --> 16:00.424
Right? A-And he set Bones up.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.826
Digitally--
in the virtual world.

16:02.860 --> 16:05.095
He moves around bits and bytes;
that's his thing.

16:05.129 --> 16:06.863
This is real money, paper,

16:06.898 --> 16:08.265
<i>things.</i>
I don't believe it.

16:08.299 --> 16:09.900
If Flynn were still alive,

16:09.934 --> 16:12.341
I'd have to send you out
to arrest him.

16:12.342 --> 16:13.727
Right,
and I wouldn't do it.

16:14.005 --> 16:15.239
You're that sure?

16:15.273 --> 16:17.374
Really, just think
about it, okay?

16:17.408 --> 16:19.543
Think, right? We keep
finding this evidence

16:19.577 --> 16:21.311
because Pelant
wants us to.

16:21.346 --> 16:22.746
You know what would
make me suspicious?

16:22.780 --> 16:25.048
If we didn't find
<i>any</i> evidence, okay?

16:25.083 --> 16:26.984
That proves to me
that Flynn was clean.

16:28.052 --> 16:29.720
Oh, wow.

16:29.754 --> 16:31.188
Look at this, huh?
Bones just found

16:31.222 --> 16:32.656
the doctor that did
Flynn's surgery.

16:32.690 --> 16:35.058
Now we'll get the truth.

16:35.093 --> 16:37.160
I hope so.

16:37.195 --> 16:39.496
<i>You implant micropor</i>

16:39.530 --> 16:41.298
ceramic pins
into complex fractures.

16:41.332 --> 16:42.699
It's a highly
experimental procedure,

16:42.734 --> 16:45.335
and you are the only
surgeon on the East Coast

16:45.370 --> 16:46.503
capable of doing it.

16:46.537 --> 16:48.372
That is correct.

16:48.406 --> 16:51.475
You operated on this man.

16:51.509 --> 16:53.343
What you don't want to do
right now is pull

16:53.378 --> 16:54.945
some doctor-patient crap,
'cause this man was murdered.

16:54.979 --> 16:57.075
Flynn. FBI agent.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.915
Yes, I performed the
procedure on him.

16:58.916 --> 16:59.842
How'd he pay for it?

16:59.867 --> 17:01.485
Anonymous donation
to my research foundation.

17:01.486 --> 17:03.754
From whom?
I can't tell you that.

17:03.788 --> 17:04.948
Can't tell me?
You son of a...

17:04.955 --> 17:06.857
Booth!
This anonymous donor

17:06.891 --> 17:09.059
not only murdered Flynn,
but he's using you

17:09.093 --> 17:10.961
to make him look corrupt.
Booth,

17:10.994 --> 17:12.396
Booth, please,

17:12.430 --> 17:14.564
let go.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.334
I'm sorry.

17:17.367 --> 17:20.203
No, <i>I'm</i> sorry.

17:20.238 --> 17:22.439
What I should have said was,
I can't tell you because

17:22.473 --> 17:24.875
when we looked for the source of
the money, we couldn't find it.

17:24.909 --> 17:27.243
Shell companies?
Yes. The money

17:27.278 --> 17:28.845
was going to aid an FBI agent

17:28.880 --> 17:30.981
who was severely wounded
in the line of duty.

17:31.015 --> 17:33.116
Our ethics committee found
no reason to refuse the money.

17:33.151 --> 17:35.385
Agent Flynn-- did he know?
I'm sorry,

17:35.420 --> 17:36.687
I have no idea what Agent Flynn

17:36.721 --> 17:38.922
- did or did not know.
- He was

17:38.956 --> 17:40.857
sedated for quite a while.

17:40.892 --> 17:42.793
Agent Flynn should have died,

17:42.827 --> 17:45.262
and he would have
if it weren't for me.

17:45.296 --> 17:47.230
And this anonymous donor?
Booth,

17:47.265 --> 17:48.999
the doctor did an incredible job

17:49.033 --> 17:51.034
repairing 11 fractures
from bullet wounds

17:51.069 --> 17:52.669
in such a short
period of time.

17:52.704 --> 17:55.439
Ten. There were
ten fractures.

17:55.473 --> 17:58.108
But I found 11 remodeled fractures.
I'm telling you,

17:58.142 --> 18:00.277
there were only ten--
your memory is playing tricks on you.

18:00.311 --> 18:01.378
That's not possible.

18:01.412 --> 18:02.779
It simply isn't.

18:05.817 --> 18:08.852
Pelant paid that surgeon
to save Flynn's life.

18:08.886 --> 18:11.524
Well, it doesn't mean that
Flynn, you know, knew.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.257
I think Pelant is framing Flynn.
Why?

18:14.258 --> 18:15.926
Because it's what you believe.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.661
Whoa, wait a second,
Bones, th...

18:17.695 --> 18:19.396
that is not rational.

18:19.430 --> 18:21.531
Certainly it is.
You told that doctor

18:21.566 --> 18:23.266
that I couldn't
possibly be wrong

18:23.301 --> 18:26.937
about the number of remodeled
fractures I found. Why?

18:26.971 --> 18:28.705
Why? Because all the time
we've been working together,

18:28.740 --> 18:30.574
you have never been wrong
about something like that.

18:30.608 --> 18:32.909
It is not possible that
you are wrong about Flynn,

18:32.944 --> 18:34.478
so I'm being
completely rational.

18:41.152 --> 18:42.953
Aw...

18:42.987 --> 18:46.289
We a-agreed to avoid
public displays of affection

18:46.324 --> 18:47.657
at the FBI.

18:47.692 --> 18:49.926
The hell with the FBI.

18:53.364 --> 18:56.633
I have to go...

18:58.202 --> 19:01.872
...do scientific things
to catch a serial killer.

19:01.906 --> 19:03.473
Right.

19:06.944 --> 19:08.912
Sibley Memorial made
these X rays

19:08.946 --> 19:10.647
the day Flynn was shot.

19:10.681 --> 19:12.682
You'll notice there
are ten fractures,

19:12.717 --> 19:15.285
all caused by
high-velocity bullets.

19:15.319 --> 19:17.254
Those must be the ones
that Dr. Itzkowitz fixed.

19:17.288 --> 19:21.191
He was telling the truth.
And these are our intake X rays

19:21.225 --> 19:22.726
of Flynn's body.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.928
The hospital's X rays
show only ten fractures,

19:24.962 --> 19:27.431
but our X rays show 11.

19:27.465 --> 19:30.100
The damage to Agent
Flynn's left humerus

19:30.134 --> 19:32.035
is not a
true fracture.

19:32.069 --> 19:33.437
What is it?

19:33.471 --> 19:35.705
It's likely Pelant
used an etching tool

19:35.740 --> 19:37.307
to simulate the break

19:37.341 --> 19:40.210
and digital lithography
for the remodeling.

19:40.244 --> 19:43.747
The craftsmanship is...
really astounding.

19:43.781 --> 19:46.116
Are you complimenting Pelant?

19:46.150 --> 19:48.018
Well, his <i>skill,</i>

19:48.052 --> 19:49.453
his intelligence.

19:49.487 --> 19:52.322
His abilities are
awe-inspiring.

19:52.356 --> 19:54.224
I've seen this one before.

19:54.258 --> 19:55.725
This is identical

19:55.760 --> 19:57.327
to a fractured bone

19:57.361 --> 19:59.863
from a homicide
I worked on nine years ago.

19:59.897 --> 20:01.465
One of Pelant's?

20:01.499 --> 20:04.267
I don't know.
It's still unsolved.

20:05.536 --> 20:07.737
Pelant is sending
me a message.

20:10.107 --> 20:13.844
Oh, here we go,
down the rabbit hole.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.375
Identical.

20:57.288 --> 21:00.190
Hello, Temperance.

21:00.224 --> 21:01.892
Pelant.

21:13.437 --> 21:16.306
Let's talk.

21:25.442 --> 21:26.498
If that goes off,

21:26.499 --> 21:27.666
it'll kill you, too.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.102
You and I are destined
to die together someday.

21:31.137 --> 21:34.306
Hope not today, but...
but that's up to you.

21:34.340 --> 21:35.840
I-I'm just...

21:35.875 --> 21:37.842
I'm gonna remind you
that you're a mother,

21:37.877 --> 21:39.844
so self-sacrifice
isn't the best option.

21:39.879 --> 21:42.647
Plus, whoever is right
above us will also die.

21:42.682 --> 21:44.749
That's a public area.

21:44.784 --> 21:45.984
Is it?

21:46.018 --> 21:47.619
What-what do you
think happened

21:47.653 --> 21:49.754
to poor Chloe Campbell?

21:50.990 --> 21:53.658
I think you killed her.
No. Wasn't me.

21:53.693 --> 21:55.093
You know who did it?

21:55.127 --> 21:57.128
Same person who did 1870,

21:57.163 --> 21:59.497
3606, 4005, 7932

21:59.532 --> 22:01.766
and 9224.
No, that's not possible.

22:01.801 --> 22:03.435
I wouldn't have missed that.

22:03.469 --> 22:04.969
Don't be so hard on yourself.

22:05.004 --> 22:07.839
They were found in different
geographical locations,

22:07.873 --> 22:10.308
killed by completely different
methods, different ages.

22:10.343 --> 22:12.644
Nothing to connect them.
And yet...

22:12.678 --> 22:15.547
they were all killed
by one person.

22:15.581 --> 22:17.048
Who?

22:17.083 --> 22:18.483
I don't know.

22:18.517 --> 22:20.085
Yet. But...

22:20.119 --> 22:22.320
because I'm better than you
and all your squinterns,

22:22.355 --> 22:24.989
I will figure out
who the killer is.

22:25.024 --> 22:28.326
I think, um...
I think she's pretty bad,

22:28.361 --> 22:30.261
and I think
she's still out there.

22:30.296 --> 22:31.267
She?

22:31.292 --> 22:33.292
Well, I'm-I'm being
sloppily generic, but...

22:33.299 --> 22:35.767
I have my reasons for thinking
it's a woman.

22:35.801 --> 22:38.203
And if anything happens to me,
sh-she'll keep doing

22:38.237 --> 22:39.738
what she's doing

22:39.772 --> 22:41.539
and you won't even
know she's there.

22:41.574 --> 22:43.875
I know you.
You'll find me.

22:43.909 --> 22:46.478
It's in the stars.

22:49.048 --> 22:52.217
Yeah, um, don't move
until that beam goes off.

22:52.251 --> 22:53.618
Think about all
the innocent lives

22:53.652 --> 22:56.721
you're saving
by-by doing absolutely nothing.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.008
I scanned the currency
you found in the apartment.

23:17.042 --> 23:18.977
Flynn's money was all

23:19.011 --> 23:21.246
new bills.
Wait, not Flynn's money.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.647
Okay, fine.

23:22.681 --> 23:24.682
The money you found hidden
in his fridge.

23:24.717 --> 23:27.218
The bills with serial numbers
on either side of the money

23:27.253 --> 23:29.888
you found are circulating
in central Maryland.

23:29.922 --> 23:32.957
There's just too many there
for it to be a coincidence.

23:32.992 --> 23:38.363
Each of these pins represents a
place where the money was spent.

23:38.397 --> 23:39.631
By Pelant.

23:39.665 --> 23:40.732
Yeah, he works alone.

23:40.766 --> 23:42.200
It's got to be him.

23:42.234 --> 23:44.502
That's still
a few hundred square miles.

23:48.941 --> 23:51.142
Wait, where's Bones?

23:51.177 --> 23:52.577
I don't... I don't know.

24:02.788 --> 24:04.789
Bones.
Don't come in, Booth.

24:04.824 --> 24:07.392
- What's going on?
- There's an explosive device.

24:07.426 --> 24:08.660
We've called the bomb squad.

24:08.694 --> 24:10.195
You all right, Bones?
It was Pelant.

24:10.229 --> 24:13.231
He says if I move,
the bomb will go off.

24:16.802 --> 24:18.736
It's not real.

24:18.771 --> 24:20.271
You can clear out.

24:20.306 --> 24:21.573
Booth?
Yeah.

24:21.607 --> 24:23.308
It's not that
I doubt you.

24:23.342 --> 24:24.375
I'm just curious how you know
it's not real.

24:24.410 --> 24:25.443
It's a toy.

24:25.478 --> 24:26.911
Okay? You can order this thing

24:26.946 --> 24:28.213
from the back
of a comic book.

24:28.247 --> 24:29.781
You know, we can wait
for the bomb squad,

24:29.815 --> 24:31.616
but you're gonna be standing
there for five hours.

24:31.650 --> 24:32.717
I'm fine.

24:32.751 --> 24:34.152
See?

24:35.521 --> 24:37.155
Fake. All right?

24:37.189 --> 24:38.456
So...

24:38.491 --> 24:40.091
what did Pelant say to you?

24:40.125 --> 24:42.427
That there's a serial killer
out there

24:42.461 --> 24:44.696
and that we'll never catch her
without him.

24:44.730 --> 24:46.164
Do you believe him?

24:46.198 --> 24:47.565
I haven't looked into it yet.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.000
You know what?
I think we're getting close.

24:49.034 --> 24:52.199
Pelant knows it and he's afraid.

25:08.149 --> 25:09.983
You looking for something
you might have missed?him.

25:10.017 --> 25:13.053
I can't find anything
that connects these cases.

25:13.087 --> 25:14.621
Pelant could be lying.

25:14.655 --> 25:15.989
He's never lied to me.

25:16.023 --> 25:17.824
Well, this could be his way
of distracting you

25:17.859 --> 25:19.759
from what's really important
right now.

25:19.794 --> 25:20.927
Or it's a clue.

25:20.962 --> 25:22.329
Dr. Brennan, I need your focus

25:22.363 --> 25:24.030
for a moment.
Were all

25:24.065 --> 25:25.665
Flynn's teeth intact?

25:25.700 --> 25:28.335
Yes. All teeth are present,

25:28.369 --> 25:32.339
except the third bicuspid
is chipped.

25:32.373 --> 25:34.007
I think I found
your missing piece.

25:34.041 --> 25:36.810
Where did you find this?

25:36.844 --> 25:37.878
In his stomach.

25:39.013 --> 25:40.647
Pelant may not have had
the opportunity

25:40.681 --> 25:43.650
to sterilize it as he did
the rest of Flynn's bones.

25:43.684 --> 25:46.419
Hodgins should swab this
for particulates.

25:46.454 --> 25:47.988
The last time I saw

25:48.022 --> 25:50.624
Agent Flynn, I boasted
that I once solved a murder

25:50.658 --> 25:52.092
using only a tooth.

25:52.126 --> 25:55.228
Okay.

25:56.330 --> 25:58.131
Dr. Brennan, do you really

25:58.165 --> 25:59.666
think it's possible
that Pelant

25:59.700 --> 26:01.067
could find a link
between these cases

26:01.102 --> 26:02.469
that you missed?

26:04.105 --> 26:07.307
Something I've learned from
Booth is to question myself.

26:07.341 --> 26:10.677
You've known Booth
longer than I have.

26:10.711 --> 26:12.646
Do you think he'll kill Pelant

26:12.680 --> 26:14.047
the next time
he has the chance?

26:14.081 --> 26:16.316
Usually I'd say no, but...

26:16.350 --> 26:18.418
the way Booth's turning Flynn
into a saint,

26:18.452 --> 26:21.154
feels like he's working
himself up for something.

26:21.188 --> 26:22.989
But Booth's
a complex man.

26:23.024 --> 26:24.557
I'm not sure any of us can tell

26:24.592 --> 26:26.326
what he's really thinking
deep down.

26:26.360 --> 26:31.331
Call me if Hodgins gets
any information from the tooth.

26:41.475 --> 26:44.377
Is it okay
if I don't have a drink?

26:44.412 --> 26:47.080
No. You people
are killing me here.

26:47.114 --> 26:48.782
This is a business.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.418
Not a very good business.

26:51.452 --> 26:53.787
Because people don't buy drinks.
Okay, what if

26:53.821 --> 26:56.957
I buy a drink
but don't drink it?

26:56.991 --> 26:59.025
That works for me.

27:04.799 --> 27:06.933
Booth wants to kill Pelant.
Which is fine.

27:06.968 --> 27:09.002
He's a very bad man.
He's murdered...

27:09.036 --> 27:11.271
we don't know how many people.
What if there's

27:11.305 --> 27:13.506
someone worse and we need Pelant
to catch that killer?

27:13.541 --> 27:15.475
Oh, God.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.243
It's these ethical dilemmas

27:17.278 --> 27:19.312
that drove me out
of the priesthood.

27:19.347 --> 27:21.381
I need to know
what Booth is going to do.

27:21.415 --> 27:23.316
So you can protect Pelant?

27:23.351 --> 27:25.986
He's more valuable alive
than dead. That's all.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.288
It depends which Booth is there.

27:28.322 --> 27:30.290
Seeley Booth, the one I love.

27:30.324 --> 27:34.127
No, I mean, like all of us,
he has two sides to him.

27:34.161 --> 27:36.596
He has one side that wants
to save the world

27:36.630 --> 27:39.065
and one side that wants
to take care of the people

27:39.100 --> 27:40.800
he loves.

27:40.835 --> 27:42.902
Those two
collide, well,

27:42.937 --> 27:45.505
that's what you call
a tortured soul.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.040
There's no such thing as a soul.

27:47.074 --> 27:48.274
Says you.

27:48.309 --> 27:50.243
But Booth values
nothing higher

27:50.277 --> 27:52.278
than his soul. Yet...

27:52.313 --> 27:55.815
he's willing to sacrifice
his soul by killing Pelant.

27:55.850 --> 27:57.484
Why?

27:57.518 --> 28:00.153
For you, of course.

28:01.655 --> 28:05.158
It's always gonna come down
to you.

28:10.883 --> 28:12.599
How's your work
going, Dr. Brennan?

28:12.624 --> 28:14.556
Pelant has left me a puzzle.

28:14.557 --> 28:16.624
I just don't know
what the solution is.

28:16.659 --> 28:18.259
Maybe there isn't one.
He could just be

28:18.294 --> 28:19.894
using these bones
to distract you.

28:19.929 --> 28:22.130
Pelant doesn't distract.
He leaves clues.

28:22.164 --> 28:24.866
The key to finding him must be
in these bones.

28:24.900 --> 28:27.769
Even if these are all
the victims of one killer,

28:27.803 --> 28:29.204
they still have nothing
to do with Pelant.

28:29.238 --> 28:31.306
Let's go after one murderer
at a time.

28:31.340 --> 28:32.941
These are the wrong bones.

28:32.975 --> 28:34.142
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

28:34.176 --> 28:36.277
Pelant switched the bones

28:36.312 --> 28:39.314
in all of the drawers
he directed me to.

28:39.348 --> 28:43.151
These aren't the bones
that belong in drawer 1870.

28:48.090 --> 28:51.126
They originate
from drawer 1452.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.628
Except for Chloe Campbell,
none of the remains

28:53.662 --> 28:55.764
are in the correct drawers.

28:55.798 --> 28:59.334
Why would Pelant switch remains
from one drawer to another?

28:59.368 --> 29:00.869
It's another code.

29:00.903 --> 29:03.037
He's sending me a message.

29:11.981 --> 29:14.349
All right,
you're gonna yell at me,

29:14.383 --> 29:17.152
but this is my job
and I'm gonna risk it.

29:17.186 --> 29:18.787
What? Are you gonna say that you
found something that indicates

29:18.821 --> 29:20.155
that Flynn
was Freudian delusional

29:20.189 --> 29:22.924
with synergistic
narcissism disorder, huh?

29:22.958 --> 29:24.426
What? I don't...
That's not a thing.

29:24.460 --> 29:25.393
I'm here about Pelant.

29:25.428 --> 29:26.694
Okay.

29:26.729 --> 29:28.062
I believe he's trying

29:28.097 --> 29:29.664
to seduce Dr. Brennan.
What?

29:29.698 --> 29:32.233
With this whole
nonexistent serial killer thing?

29:32.268 --> 29:33.368
No.

29:33.402 --> 29:34.969
Yes, but mostly no.

29:35.004 --> 29:37.505
I'm saying
in a more profound way.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.008
Bones hates Pelant.

29:40.042 --> 29:42.510
Exactly. Pelant is using
my research

29:42.545 --> 29:44.379
against you and Dr. Brennan.

29:44.413 --> 29:46.014
And the lesson
that he's taken from that

29:46.048 --> 29:48.349
is that Dr. Brennan changes
her mind about people.

29:48.384 --> 29:49.851
Okay, what people?
After your first case together,

29:49.885 --> 29:51.286
she detested you.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.954
And she hated me at first, too.
Right?

29:52.988 --> 29:54.722
You know what?
She never hated you. She just

29:54.757 --> 29:56.324
didn't believe in the stuff
that you were saying.

29:56.358 --> 29:57.425
That's all.
Right.

29:57.460 --> 29:58.526
But now we're very close.

29:58.561 --> 30:00.195
Pelant truly believes

30:00.229 --> 30:02.130
that he can make Dr. Brennan
see him in a new light.

30:02.164 --> 30:03.531
The-the same way that you did.

30:03.566 --> 30:04.933
You got to be kidding me.
That's crazy.

30:04.967 --> 30:06.201
Pelant's crazy.
What does... what does

30:06.235 --> 30:07.735
all this mean, Sweets?
Spell it out.

30:07.770 --> 30:08.736
Well, Dr. Brennan

30:08.771 --> 30:09.904
is Pelant's endgame.

30:09.939 --> 30:11.673
He's trying to replace you.

30:11.707 --> 30:14.509
Has he done anything
to prevent the two of you

30:14.543 --> 30:18.213
from getting together
that we don't know about?

30:21.350 --> 30:23.551
I'll take that as a yes.

30:23.586 --> 30:26.020
Does this mean
he won't hurt Bones?

30:26.055 --> 30:28.156
Up until the moment he discovers

30:28.190 --> 30:30.225
that she'll never have him,
yeah.

30:30.259 --> 30:32.160
Then what happens?

30:32.194 --> 30:34.028
Then he kills her,

30:34.063 --> 30:38.299
he kills himself
and anyone else nearby.

30:42.471 --> 30:44.272
You sure we're safe
to work in here?

30:44.306 --> 30:45.306
I've tripled my firewalls

30:45.307 --> 30:46.774
just to be sure.

30:46.809 --> 30:49.210
Security has no idea
how Pelant got in the building.

30:49.245 --> 30:51.112
I pulled the closed circuit
files to see

30:51.146 --> 30:52.647
if I could find anything
they missed.

30:52.681 --> 30:53.615
Let me guess,

30:53.649 --> 30:54.616
they were all corrupted.

30:54.650 --> 30:56.384
Completely.

30:56.418 --> 30:58.319
Pelant only lets us find
what he wants us to find.

30:58.354 --> 31:00.021
I swabbed the tooth you pulled
out of Flynn's stomach.

31:00.055 --> 31:02.156
Please tell me you found something.
I found a whole lot

31:02.191 --> 31:03.424
of minerally goodness.
Look at this:

31:03.459 --> 31:06.427
iron oxide, sulfur,
uranium, thorium,

31:06.462 --> 31:08.429
calcium, potassium, a smidgen
of silicon dioxide.

31:08.464 --> 31:12.033
Let me rephrase. Please tell me
you found one thing I can use.

31:12.067 --> 31:15.336
All of this is one thing:
it's bituminous coal ash.

31:15.371 --> 31:18.806
So Flynn was in the proximity
of a coal-burning fire

31:18.841 --> 31:20.141
when his tooth was chipped?

31:20.175 --> 31:22.477
Who burns coal anymore?

31:22.511 --> 31:25.179
Old foundries or power plants.
I mean, their furnaces,

31:25.214 --> 31:27.455
they would definitely have
this kind of mix of compounds.

31:27.855 --> 31:29.581
We know
Pelant is working out

31:29.582 --> 31:31.586
- of central Maryland.
- Okay. All right.

31:31.587 --> 31:33.655
Well, then see what you can
find in that radius.

31:33.689 --> 31:35.657
Okay, there's this.

31:35.691 --> 31:38.059
The Keeler Power Plant.
They shut down

31:38.093 --> 31:39.961
operations ten years ago.

31:39.995 --> 31:41.262
An abandoned power plant.

31:41.297 --> 31:43.064
Yeah, that would give Pelant
isolation,

31:43.098 --> 31:44.632
scale, a power supply.
Hey,

31:44.667 --> 31:46.834
this is the perfect
infrastructure to work from.

31:46.869 --> 31:48.703
I'll call Booth.

31:50.706 --> 31:52.340
What's this?
What's this?

31:52.374 --> 31:53.908
We found Pelant.
I'm going after him.

31:53.943 --> 31:56.210
Yes, with a SWAT team.
No,

31:56.245 --> 31:57.679
he's not gonna let that happen,
you understand me?

31:57.713 --> 31:59.180
This is between me, him,

31:59.214 --> 32:00.682
and Bones.
What makes you think

32:00.716 --> 32:02.417
Pelant didn't
put that tooth

32:02.451 --> 32:05.053
in Flynn's stomach himself
to lure you out there?

32:05.087 --> 32:06.654
Because I know Flynn, all right?
He chipped his own tooth

32:06.689 --> 32:08.045
and swallowed it
so we could find it.

32:08.070 --> 32:09.190
You must be
pretty damn sure

32:09.191 --> 32:11.793
Hayes Flynn
was the man you think he is.

32:11.827 --> 32:14.662
I'd bet my life on it.

32:14.697 --> 32:18.533
The Keeler Power Plant
is 23 miles away.

32:18.567 --> 32:20.001
Booth is gonna need a schematic.

32:20.035 --> 32:21.555
All right, I'll send
this to his phone.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.504
Pelant will have eyes and ears
all over this place.

32:23.539 --> 32:25.979
I mean, he's gonna pick up the signals.
I'm frequency-hopping.

32:26.008 --> 32:28.676
We have at least 15 minutes
before he suspects anything.

32:28.711 --> 32:30.378
Unless he set it all up.

32:30.412 --> 32:33.848
I'm inventorying all
the security feeds in the area.

32:33.882 --> 32:36.184
Is that Booth?

32:36.218 --> 32:38.353
Oh, man. He's way too early.

32:39.254 --> 32:42.090
That's Brennan's car.

32:43.192 --> 32:44.225
How the hell did Brennan

32:44.259 --> 32:45.760
know where to go?

32:47.830 --> 32:49.764
Booth.

32:49.798 --> 32:51.232
Hold on, hold on.

32:56.572 --> 32:58.640
Damn it.

32:58.674 --> 33:00.308
Oh, my Lord.

33:33.632 --> 33:36.234
Can you pick up her
visual on another feed?

33:36.268 --> 33:38.169
I don't have anything
from inside the plant.

33:38.204 --> 33:40.071
How did she find him?

33:40.105 --> 33:42.607
I was looking at these old cold
cases, and these are her notes.

33:42.641 --> 33:44.909
I mean, there isn't much.
It's a list of cities.

33:44.944 --> 33:47.912
Damascus, Germantown,
Aspen Hill in Maryland.

33:47.947 --> 33:51.683
Woodstock and Sterling in
Virginia and Washington, D.C.

33:51.717 --> 33:54.986
These cities all correspond
to the original victims

33:55.020 --> 33:57.522
from the bone drawers
Pelant named.

33:57.556 --> 33:58.941
How did this lead Brennan
to the power plant?

33:58.966 --> 34:00.325
I don't know.

34:00.326 --> 34:03.595
She also wrote down this word
"Aquila." A-Q-U-I-L-A.

34:03.629 --> 34:04.430
What does that mean?

34:04.463 --> 34:06.030
Okay, Aquila.

34:06.065 --> 34:08.233
Uh, Latin for "eagle."

34:08.266 --> 34:10.034
Game reserve,

34:10.069 --> 34:12.670
Italian aircraft
carrier, constellation.

34:12.705 --> 34:15.139
Constellation.
It's the name of the bird

34:15.174 --> 34:18.275
that devoured Prometheus' liver.

34:18.310 --> 34:20.245
Lay the constellation
over the map.

34:24.016 --> 34:25.382
Six

34:25.417 --> 34:27.351
of these stars line up,
and the seventh star...

34:27.386 --> 34:29.152
Altair. This is it.

34:29.188 --> 34:31.155
This is the brightest one,
and that's where Pelant is.

34:31.190 --> 34:32.956
That son of a bitch
wrote her a love note

34:32.992 --> 34:34.792
that only she could understand.

35:19.471 --> 35:21.506
Welcome.

35:21.540 --> 35:24.175
Turn left and walk straight

35:24.209 --> 35:26.678
until I tell you to stop.

36:03.616 --> 36:04.549
There's Booth.
Can you open the gate?

36:04.583 --> 36:05.116
I'm trying, but Pelant's
got me blocked out.

36:05.150 --> 36:06.071
Can't you do something?

36:28.774 --> 36:31.409
Christopher?

36:52.564 --> 36:54.165
I'm here.

36:54.199 --> 36:56.534
So am I.

36:56.568 --> 36:58.503
Nice to see you.

37:08.580 --> 37:10.515
Temperance,
you look beautiful.

37:10.549 --> 37:13.885
How much time do you think we
have before Booth gets here?

37:13.919 --> 37:15.253
I'm alone.

37:15.287 --> 37:17.088
Yeah, but that never lasts

37:17.122 --> 37:19.123
for very long, does it?

37:46.518 --> 37:49.187
If you surrender to me,
Booth won't kill you.

37:49.221 --> 37:51.956
And if I don't, you'll shoot me?

37:54.526 --> 37:58.229
There's only one
rational choice.

37:58.263 --> 37:59.630
Good.

37:59.665 --> 38:00.998
But you know Booth.

38:01.033 --> 38:03.167
Very sneaky, very stealthy,
sniper at heart.

38:03.202 --> 38:05.236
It'll take him forever
to get inside.

38:22.821 --> 38:25.089
If I try to run away,

38:25.124 --> 38:27.558
where will you shoot me?

38:27.593 --> 38:29.360
In the head.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.329
Never the head.

38:31.363 --> 38:34.365
That's the part
of me you like best.

38:47.246 --> 38:49.480
The mysterious
serial killer--

38:49.515 --> 38:51.983
are you curious why
I think it's a woman?

38:52.017 --> 38:54.886
No, but I do want to know

38:54.920 --> 38:57.655
if Hayes Flynn was working with you.
Not wittingly.

38:57.689 --> 39:00.258
I mean, he didn't know
about the money in his fridge

39:00.292 --> 39:02.293
or the bug in his car.

39:02.327 --> 39:04.395
Please drop the gun.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.564
What?

39:12.738 --> 39:14.172
Oh, God.

39:14.206 --> 39:16.707
Something exploded.

39:16.742 --> 39:18.709
Hey, can you hear me? I-I...

39:18.744 --> 39:20.111
I tried to shape the blast

39:20.145 --> 39:21.712
so that it wouldn't
deafen you, but,

39:21.747 --> 39:23.614
you know, no-nobody's perfect.

39:23.649 --> 39:25.950
Here, come here. Hey.

39:25.984 --> 39:27.518
I'm always ahead
of you people.

39:27.553 --> 39:29.520
I-I... I know how you work.

39:29.555 --> 39:31.923
You let me lead you into
this trap, and Booth is still

39:31.957 --> 39:33.291
circling the building
looking for a way in.

39:33.325 --> 39:35.660
Looks like I came full circle.

39:35.694 --> 39:38.229
You okay, Bones?
I'm okay.

39:38.263 --> 39:42.533
Surprise! The next explosion
will level the entire building.

39:42.568 --> 39:46.437
Dr. Brennan, tell Booth to leave
now, or I will blow us all up.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.040
He's bluffing. It's a toy
just like the last time.

39:49.074 --> 39:50.308
I'm not gonna
take that risk.

39:50.342 --> 39:52.310
Do you see, Booth?
She's willing

39:52.344 --> 39:56.514
to risk your life to keep me
alive. What does that tell you?

39:56.548 --> 39:58.382
You put it down,
or I'm gonna kill you.

39:58.417 --> 40:00.852
Shoot him, Booth.
What?

40:00.886 --> 40:02.887
I'm not willing to risk
your life to keep Pelant alive.

40:02.921 --> 40:04.388
Not for one second.
Shoot him!

40:04.423 --> 40:05.423
Time's up.

40:19.905 --> 40:21.505
You okay?

40:21.540 --> 40:22.907
You okay?

40:22.941 --> 40:25.076
Don't worry. It's okay.

40:25.110 --> 40:27.211
He's dead.

40:27.246 --> 40:28.813
He is dead?

40:37.689 --> 40:40.291
I'm sorry.
Well, you know, you should be sorry.

40:40.325 --> 40:42.927
I did want him alive,
and I was pretty sure

40:42.961 --> 40:44.595
that you'd kill him
if you could.

40:44.630 --> 40:46.430
Well, you know what?
You weren't wrong.

40:46.465 --> 40:47.965
I did kill him.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.934
You gave him a chance.

40:49.968 --> 40:51.936
You're a very good man.

40:51.970 --> 40:55.306
I'm in to Pelant's
security system.

40:58.911 --> 41:01.879
That's them.

41:01.914 --> 41:04.181
Oh, thank God.

41:06.818 --> 41:08.419
Look, we got
to make a deal,

41:08.453 --> 41:10.321
and this deal has got
to stick, all right?

41:10.355 --> 41:12.023
From now on, I will
do all the fighting

41:12.057 --> 41:14.759
and the shooting and the
apprehending of killers, okay?

41:14.793 --> 41:16.994
You can do all the
smart stuff, right?

41:17.029 --> 41:18.696
You can stay in the lab
and play with your bones

41:18.730 --> 41:20.231
and all that good stuff.

41:20.265 --> 41:21.866
You know, I don't come
into your lab there

41:21.900 --> 41:24.335
and play with your telescopes
and stuff like that.

41:24.369 --> 41:26.604
I don't have a telescope.

41:28.373 --> 41:31.342
What's wrong?

41:31.376 --> 41:32.877
Are they both
all right?

41:32.911 --> 41:35.947
Looks like it.

41:37.916 --> 41:40.785
Why'd they stop?

41:41.887 --> 41:45.890
Look, the main
reason that I, um...

41:45.924 --> 41:48.526
wanted to kill Pelant

41:48.560 --> 41:50.861
was because, um,

41:50.896 --> 41:53.497
he kept me from
marrying you.

41:54.666 --> 41:56.901
I thought
it was something like that.

41:56.935 --> 41:58.469
Look, and if
I told you

41:58.503 --> 42:00.304
why we couldn't
get married,

42:00.339 --> 42:02.974
he was gonna kill
innocent people.

42:04.376 --> 42:07.611
You made the right choice.

42:07.646 --> 42:10.481
It's all right.

42:14.286 --> 42:18.222
Bones...

42:18.256 --> 42:22.526
if I ask you to marry me,

42:22.561 --> 42:25.663
will you say yes?

42:25.697 --> 42:29.433
If I say yes,
will we get married?

42:29.468 --> 42:31.869
Yes.

42:39.044 --> 42:41.445
Was that what
it looked like?

42:41.480 --> 42:43.781
Looks like
a proposal.

42:43.815 --> 42:47.018
I feel like
we missed a whole bunch.

42:47.052 --> 42:50.654
Who cares? We were here
for the big happy ending.

42:50.689 --> 42:55.689
