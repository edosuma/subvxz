WEBVTT

00:45.633 --> 00:46.716
Max.

00:48.878 --> 00:50.545
Max, do you hear me?

00:53.463 --> 00:54.463
Max.

01:16.530 --> 01:17.778
I'm here to see Mr. Vargas.

01:17.780 --> 01:19.947
Yes, give me one second.

01:25.915 --> 01:28.032
Mr. Vargas, someone is here to see you.

01:28.034 --> 01:29.284
I'll take that.

01:34.481 --> 01:36.966
He'll be with you in just one minute.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.420
You wanted to see me, sir?

01:48.422 --> 01:49.422
Yes.

01:53.289 --> 01:54.706
I have, you know.

01:56.313 --> 01:59.230
Has been good to you and your team.

02:00.202 --> 02:01.202
My team.

02:03.299 --> 02:06.536
We built something extraordinary.

02:06.538 --> 02:09.038
What's wrong, sir?

02:09.039 --> 02:11.225
It's appearing that one

02:11.227 --> 02:13.477
of those shadows is shoddy.

03:02.975 --> 03:06.091
Man, go away, I'm sleeping.

04:09.845 --> 04:11.804
I mean, what do you mean by that?

04:11.806 --> 04:16.036
My team is smart, precise,
resourceful, and loyal.

04:23.892 --> 04:24.926
What the hell, man?

04:24.928 --> 04:25.895
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

04:25.897 --> 04:27.228
I have allergies.

04:30.622 --> 04:34.630
Well, one of
them isn't smart enough

04:34.632 --> 04:36.965
to be present in the circle.

04:38.594 --> 04:39.763
Somebody call 911.

04:39.765 --> 04:40.765
Oh my God.

04:43.233 --> 04:45.425
Why they pretend to be loyal?

04:45.427 --> 04:47.500
How do you know?

04:59.134 --> 05:01.150
What's your problem?

05:08.056 --> 05:10.065
The real question.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.525
What are you going to do about it?

05:25.407 --> 05:26.376
I had him.

05:26.378 --> 05:28.149
I swear I had him.

05:35.357 --> 05:38.857
I mean, I wasn't gonna let him hurt you.

05:40.186 --> 05:42.731
I don't know how this could happen.

05:42.733 --> 05:43.935
I mean, they were home grown,

05:43.937 --> 05:46.961
so there's no way to be
infiltrated from the outside.

05:46.963 --> 05:49.179
I handpicked them myself.

05:49.181 --> 05:52.246
I mean, they are what
they are because of me.

05:52.248 --> 05:55.184
None of them did what they
do now before I found them.

05:55.186 --> 05:58.899
What do you have in mind?

05:58.901 --> 06:01.279
There's only one solution.

06:01.281 --> 06:02.745
Eliminate the problem.

06:16.613 --> 06:19.540
What do you need from me?

06:19.542 --> 06:21.098
Men.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.318
To cover exits and to wear them out

06:23.320 --> 06:26.178
before we make 'em kill each other.

07:02.784 --> 07:04.296
Make them kill each other.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.298
I like it.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.623
It's twisted, but I like it.

07:09.478 --> 07:10.601
Just give me the men.

07:10.603 --> 07:12.788
I'll take care of the rest.

07:12.790 --> 07:15.116
Okay, consider it done.

07:25.408 --> 07:27.786
It's a shame that his only weakness

07:27.788 --> 07:29.871
is how much he trusts me.

07:31.224 --> 07:32.224
Well.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.791
Once Shadows are dead.

07:36.783 --> 07:38.328
Kill Watcher.

07:43.259 --> 07:44.259
Yes, sir.

07:46.064 --> 07:50.064
Watcher and Shadow
cannot be dead soon enough.

09:42.426 --> 09:43.426
Bro.

09:45.718 --> 09:50.280
You knew when the meds wore
off that I would be back.

09:50.282 --> 09:53.939
And for crying out loud,
please brush your teeth.

09:53.941 --> 09:57.529
Smells like a bag of
shit just hit my face.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.448
So what did I miss, hm?

10:00.733 --> 10:01.962
Safe career?

10:01.964 --> 10:04.653
Golf, maybe tennis now.

10:04.655 --> 10:07.257
You must have 'cause we're still alive.

10:07.259 --> 10:08.259
Right?

10:09.847 --> 10:10.847
Right?

10:11.833 --> 10:12.833
I get it.

10:13.519 --> 10:17.277
You still don't know what to
do with the rest of your life.

10:17.279 --> 10:21.036
Well has it ever occurred
to you that I want to live?

10:21.038 --> 10:22.152
Yes, no, maybe.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.321
Check the box.

10:27.302 --> 10:29.150
Okay, you're going to ignore me.

10:29.152 --> 10:30.299
I see.

10:30.301 --> 10:31.661
Very well then.

10:31.663 --> 10:34.260
I'm just going to sit here
and make annoying sounds

10:34.262 --> 10:36.119
until you talk to me.

10:36.121 --> 10:37.516
Ah.

10:37.518 --> 10:38.518
No, no, no.

10:39.273 --> 10:40.104
No laffy.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.106
No taffy.

10:42.297 --> 10:45.889
What do you think Mom would think of us?

10:45.891 --> 10:49.118
About us killing people and stuff?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.787
What would Jesus do?

10:51.870 --> 10:56.453
You think God would take a
liking to us killing people?

10:58.782 --> 11:00.032
You don't care.

11:01.859 --> 11:05.526
Besides, we haven't
went to church in years.

11:12.037 --> 11:14.454
I'm a Raisin Bran man myself.

11:17.891 --> 11:20.547
Are you listening to me?

11:20.549 --> 11:21.840
You know one of these days we're not

11:21.842 --> 11:23.370
gonna be able to talk to each other

11:23.372 --> 11:26.272
all because you want to play kill a ninja.

11:26.274 --> 11:28.320
Who you think you are, hm?

11:28.322 --> 11:29.322
Chunoby.

11:30.119 --> 11:31.873
Street Fighter.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.214
Ken.

11:33.216 --> 11:34.712
Oh, you must be Ryu.

11:34.714 --> 11:36.292
Hadouken.

11:36.294 --> 11:38.294
Fool, you ain't nothing.

11:40.034 --> 11:41.973
And what is this here?

11:41.975 --> 11:43.576
This has got to be the worst movie

11:43.578 --> 11:46.070
I have ever seen in my life.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.378
Please change the channel.

11:48.380 --> 11:49.980
Ah.

11:49.982 --> 11:51.232
Turn it to PBS.

12:10.314 --> 12:13.663
Well, last night was fun, wasn't it?

12:13.665 --> 12:15.377
If you say so.

12:15.379 --> 12:16.567
I had him, you know.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.544
You didn't have to take the shot.

12:18.546 --> 12:19.934
Seriously?

12:19.936 --> 12:22.249
That's not what I was talking about.

12:22.251 --> 12:24.390
You're still upset about that?

12:24.392 --> 12:26.201
It's not a competition.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.203
I did it to protect you.

12:33.862 --> 12:36.704
You're all we have in this world.

12:36.706 --> 12:39.123
I have something to tell you.

12:40.011 --> 12:41.344
Pay attention.

12:43.238 --> 12:44.616
You're right though.

12:44.618 --> 12:46.691
I'd have done the same thing.

12:46.693 --> 12:47.693
I love you.

12:51.963 --> 12:52.963
Ugh.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.274
You know that's what pizza's for, right?

14:49.640 --> 14:51.640
Keep it going.

15:17.552 --> 15:18.552
Yeah.

15:20.412 --> 15:21.412
Right now?

15:23.598 --> 15:24.598
You got it.

16:13.574 --> 16:16.220
And why won't you keep this place clean?

16:16.222 --> 16:17.731
Just the other day I seen two roaches

16:17.733 --> 16:19.102
having sex with each other

16:19.104 --> 16:21.715
and they had a baby and called it Bambi.

16:21.717 --> 16:23.627
This is why we don't have a girlfriend

16:23.629 --> 16:25.910
or a life for that matter.

16:25.912 --> 16:27.379
The Jergens bottle.

16:27.381 --> 16:31.487
It was already basically
used when you last seen it.

16:31.489 --> 16:35.674
Hey, let's go on another
date with Mr. Wack It today.

16:35.676 --> 16:38.829
Oh look, our favorite baseball team is on.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.831
The Yankees.

16:41.508 --> 16:45.928
Oh, it's two minutes past
the self pleasure hour.

16:45.930 --> 16:46.762
Ha ha.

16:55.975 --> 16:57.168
Watcher.

16:57.170 --> 16:58.403
What's up?

17:01.435 --> 17:02.435
What now?

17:03.701 --> 17:04.961
Yeah.

17:04.963 --> 17:06.132
All right.

17:09.739 --> 17:11.906
Oh, there he goes again.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.734
Went back into the other room.

17:14.737 --> 17:15.944
Into the mist.

18:08.492 --> 18:09.577
This is weird.

18:09.579 --> 18:12.123
Yeah, something's odd.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.137
You know what, Max?

18:13.139 --> 18:15.715
Maybe we should really rethink this thing

18:15.717 --> 18:18.592
and turn back around and go home, right?

18:18.594 --> 18:20.706
Plus I have to go pee.

18:20.708 --> 18:21.841
The way you been treating me this morning

18:21.843 --> 18:23.740
I should just piss on you.

18:23.742 --> 18:24.742
Right there.

18:26.098 --> 18:28.092
Clearly something is not right here.

18:56.366 --> 18:57.898
Hello, Shadows.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.403
I've called you here tonight
for a very important session.

19:01.405 --> 19:03.617
One that might be your last.

19:03.619 --> 19:06.891
You will have three rounds
that you will have to survive.

19:06.893 --> 19:10.341
Survive meaning the last one alive.

19:10.343 --> 19:11.843
What?

19:11.845 --> 19:12.949
Round one will be against

19:12.951 --> 19:15.306
the many guards you here tonight.

19:15.308 --> 19:18.961
Round two you will have to
face off against each other.

19:18.963 --> 19:21.182
Round three will be
announced after the results

19:21.184 --> 19:23.438
of the first two rounds.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.960
Is he serious?

19:24.962 --> 19:28.193
He expects us to go through with this?

19:28.195 --> 19:30.978
Are doors are sealed
and guarded heavily.

19:30.980 --> 19:33.365
You will not be able to escape.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.098
There are weapons hidden
throughout the warehouse

19:35.100 --> 19:37.411
to be used at your disposal.

19:37.413 --> 19:41.830
The last man or woman who
makes it to my office wins.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.284
You see?

19:44.286 --> 19:45.426
I told you we should've left.

19:45.428 --> 19:46.686
I told you.

19:46.688 --> 19:51.197
Now we 'bout to die all because
you didn't listen to me.

19:51.199 --> 19:52.657
I'll never get to see Lebron James

19:52.659 --> 19:55.429
lose the rest of his hair.

19:55.431 --> 19:58.714
I'll never have that
threesome with Bunny and X.

19:58.716 --> 20:03.440
I'll never get to see the
Browns go to the Superbowl.

20:03.442 --> 20:05.153
Wait a minute.

20:05.155 --> 20:07.800
Browns will never go to the Superbowl.

20:07.802 --> 20:09.009
They suck.

20:18.466 --> 20:20.864
I'm sorry that it has to be this way,

20:20.866 --> 20:24.235
but one of you have
left me with no choice.

20:24.237 --> 20:25.987
Round one begins now.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.887
I need you to make it through this, Max.

21:43.194 --> 21:44.090
Well, well, well.

21:44.092 --> 21:45.667
Look what we have here.

21:45.669 --> 21:46.648
Me, I'm mad.

21:46.650 --> 21:49.079
Look at me, I'm Max.

21:49.081 --> 21:50.660
I can do mad face.

21:50.662 --> 21:51.494
Wait, wait.

21:51.496 --> 21:52.601
Think it's a game, don't you?

21:52.603 --> 21:54.203
Bite your damn nose off.

21:54.205 --> 21:56.738
Got me down here like a
four year old toddler.

22:06.257 --> 22:07.197
Now.

22:25.998 --> 22:26.998
I'm out.

22:35.370 --> 22:37.766
One in the chamber.

25:13.730 --> 25:14.949
This is bullshit.

25:14.951 --> 25:17.528
What did he mean one of
us left him no choice?

25:47.010 --> 25:48.453
Blowticious.

25:48.455 --> 25:49.480
Skeevee.

25:49.482 --> 25:50.751
Delicious.

25:50.753 --> 25:52.721
You don't find it a little bit suspicious

25:52.723 --> 25:55.406
that no one has gone in this door.

25:55.408 --> 25:57.140
Don't you watch any movies?

26:00.104 --> 26:01.771
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.350
You boys lost?

26:04.352 --> 26:06.817
Let me help you find your way.

26:18.076 --> 26:18.908
Dammit.

26:23.892 --> 26:25.066
Junk.

26:32.135 --> 26:33.529
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:33.531 --> 26:34.539
I got this.

26:34.541 --> 26:36.311
Let me show you how it's done.

27:42.830 --> 27:43.973
You see?

27:43.975 --> 27:45.598
I told you.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.433
That could've been us.

27:48.909 --> 27:50.742
Messed up my H&M suit.

27:54.516 --> 27:55.849
What happened?

28:02.102 --> 28:03.112
Where's Bunny?

28:03.114 --> 28:03.948
I don't know.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.056
Should we look for her?

28:05.058 --> 28:05.889
No.

28:05.891 --> 28:06.723
We keep moving.

28:06.725 --> 28:08.265
Watcher owes us answers.

28:08.267 --> 28:09.669
Something isn't adding up.

28:09.671 --> 28:10.920
He's right.

28:10.922 --> 28:11.782
We'll find her later.

28:11.784 --> 28:13.033
She'll be fine.

28:15.138 --> 28:17.221
Sure Max, lead the way.

28:26.064 --> 28:27.944
What's wrong?

28:40.520 --> 28:41.520
Hello.

28:43.351 --> 28:44.351
Hello?

28:45.988 --> 28:50.265
Tonight, we take the
master for a test drive.

28:50.267 --> 28:52.184
It's about damn time.

28:54.268 --> 28:55.638
I need that job done.

28:55.640 --> 28:56.723
I can't wait.

28:59.061 --> 29:02.061
Do you think your guy can handle it?

29:03.047 --> 29:05.214
Just tell us the target.

29:07.195 --> 29:09.278
The target are Shadows.

29:14.416 --> 29:17.416
Okay, but we want the pay upfront.

29:19.593 --> 29:20.424
Okay.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.394
Hold on.

29:27.732 --> 29:28.786
Done.

29:28.788 --> 29:30.445
Check your account.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.117
Well consider it done.

29:47.305 --> 29:49.521
Would you two hurry up?

29:49.523 --> 29:51.103
It's your turn.

30:01.357 --> 30:03.440
Why you want them dead?

30:05.542 --> 30:07.375
They're your own team.

30:09.003 --> 30:14.003
They've gotten you out of
some serious jams before.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.193
Hell, most of the other crime families

30:16.195 --> 30:18.148
are afraid of you because of them.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.597
I create a sleeping dragon.

30:20.599 --> 30:21.599
I must say.

30:22.714 --> 30:25.797
Wanted to sleep before it's realized.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.080
Power.

30:42.899 --> 30:46.428
What do you think is gonna happen

30:46.430 --> 30:50.763
when the dragon realizes
it was you that woke it up?

30:56.061 --> 30:57.061
Sorry.

30:57.791 --> 30:59.242
You're out of it.

31:45.129 --> 31:46.532
What happened?

31:46.534 --> 31:47.847
What going on?

31:47.849 --> 31:51.516
I just seen the masters
enter the warehouse.

31:54.461 --> 31:59.294
You were taking too long so
I call in the reinforcement.

32:01.830 --> 32:02.772
Okay.

32:02.774 --> 32:05.356
I clean up the mess afterwards.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.240
Good.

32:08.613 --> 32:12.030
Disappear of this so I can sleep tonight.

32:14.312 --> 32:15.676
Bye.

32:21.626 --> 32:23.454
Yeah, sure.

32:32.126 --> 32:33.126
Max.

32:33.942 --> 32:36.270
What happens when we get to Watcher?

32:36.272 --> 32:37.355
We ask why?

32:38.950 --> 32:40.271
Then what?

32:40.273 --> 32:43.086
What if we don't like the answer?

32:43.088 --> 32:44.750
He has a valid point there.

32:44.752 --> 32:47.502
What if we don't like the answer?

32:50.967 --> 32:53.871
Must be that time of the month.

32:58.095 --> 32:59.943
This is bullshit.

32:59.945 --> 33:01.980
He says one of us is
the reason for all this.

33:01.982 --> 33:03.206
We'll be fine.

33:03.208 --> 33:05.098
We've been through some
tough times before.

33:05.100 --> 33:07.445
Everything will be all right.

33:07.447 --> 33:08.697
I'm pregnant.

33:10.604 --> 33:11.519
What?

33:11.521 --> 33:12.594
Now?

33:12.596 --> 33:14.197
No, later.

33:14.199 --> 33:15.084
Yes now.

33:15.086 --> 33:17.206
That's what I was trying
to tell you at lunch.

33:57.573 --> 33:59.752
Round two has begun.

33:59.754 --> 34:01.338
You will face off against each other

34:01.340 --> 34:03.072
in a fight to the death.

34:03.074 --> 34:06.516
It ends only when one of
you is left breathing.

34:06.518 --> 34:08.608
Motivation for your task.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.475
There's a mole amongst you.

34:10.476 --> 34:13.560
Trust only your instincts to survive.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.094
Don't let me down, Max.

34:19.797 --> 34:20.797
A mole?

34:21.571 --> 34:23.731
That's what he said.

34:23.733 --> 34:25.840
Let's kill ourselves a mole.

34:56.867 --> 34:58.132
What's your problem?

34:58.134 --> 34:59.917
Didn't you hear?

34:59.919 --> 35:01.520
Round two started.

35:01.522 --> 35:02.749
We have to do this.

35:02.751 --> 35:04.001
No, we don't.

35:04.985 --> 35:06.254
We're gonna get to Watcher's office

35:06.256 --> 35:07.874
and find out what's going on.

35:07.876 --> 35:10.134
So we can get blown up again?

35:10.136 --> 35:11.160
He has a valid point there, too.

35:11.162 --> 35:11.994
Leave me alone.

35:11.996 --> 35:14.015
You shut up.

35:14.017 --> 35:15.573
Oh, I get it.

35:15.575 --> 35:18.351
You probably knew about
that bomb, didn't you?

35:18.353 --> 35:20.565
Watcher probably told you about it.

35:20.567 --> 35:22.493
He always liked you anyway.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.041
You probably were gonna
trick me to going in there.

35:24.043 --> 35:25.043
Weren't you?

35:26.157 --> 35:27.766
Something a dirty mole would do.

35:27.768 --> 35:29.306
Wait, what?

35:29.308 --> 35:30.358
Son of a bitch.

35:45.157 --> 35:46.574
Bunny, come on.

35:47.969 --> 35:50.026
We're a team, remember?

35:50.028 --> 35:51.565
We shouldn't.

35:51.567 --> 35:52.734
Can't do this.

35:54.478 --> 35:56.791
Guess she's alive, right?

35:56.793 --> 36:00.357
She wouldn't turn on the team unless.

36:00.359 --> 36:01.776
She's the mole.

36:03.151 --> 36:04.568
Come on, Bunny.

36:05.429 --> 36:06.885
We're like family.

36:06.887 --> 36:08.054
We are family.

36:09.620 --> 36:11.590
Please don't do this.

36:11.592 --> 36:14.579
We'll make you the godmother of our baby.

36:14.581 --> 36:16.726
That's what you're gonna offer her?

36:16.728 --> 36:18.547
Our unborn child?

36:18.549 --> 36:20.031
Would you stop?

36:20.033 --> 36:21.213
I was trying to help here.

36:21.215 --> 36:22.112
Help?

36:22.114 --> 36:22.946
Oh great.

36:22.948 --> 36:26.253
Hey psycho who kills people
and doesn't even speak,

36:26.255 --> 36:30.084
you wanna be the guardian of
our child if you don't kill us?

36:30.086 --> 36:31.254
Great plan, honey.

36:31.256 --> 36:32.293
Great plan.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.579
Bunny, you're such a bitch.

36:46.581 --> 36:48.664
I never liked you anyway.

36:49.897 --> 36:50.908
Bunny, my ass.

36:50.910 --> 36:51.742
She's a mole.

36:51.744 --> 36:54.052
Sh, don't say that.

36:54.054 --> 36:55.378
Bunny.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.380
It's just the hormones talking.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.953
She didn't mean it.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.235
Don't shush me.

37:00.237 --> 37:01.776
And why are you defending her?

37:01.778 --> 37:02.945
I'm your wife.

37:05.438 --> 37:07.514
Don't make me do this.

37:07.516 --> 37:10.197
It's probably against my
better judgment to say this,

37:10.199 --> 37:13.788
but you probably want to play
it safe and kill his ass.

37:13.790 --> 37:16.707
I'm gonna enjoy watching you die.

37:23.519 --> 37:24.706
Gin, stop.

38:05.329 --> 38:06.528
I'll show you hormones.

38:06.530 --> 38:07.362
Sh.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.241
No, no, no, no, no.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.075
No.

38:56.923 --> 38:57.923
No.

39:19.612 --> 39:21.029
You were right.

39:22.295 --> 39:25.045
I should've left a long time ago.

39:28.315 --> 39:30.732
Should've tried to be normal.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.879
But I'm good at it.

39:37.881 --> 39:40.964
And I've never been good at anything.

39:44.672 --> 39:47.672
Watcher found me in a bad situation.

39:49.633 --> 39:51.607
And I owed Vargas.

39:51.609 --> 39:55.630
So it was either this or die so I stayed.

40:02.806 --> 40:07.723
He gave me a family and I was
sick of being a lonely loser.

40:10.983 --> 40:13.743
But you have to move forward.

40:13.745 --> 40:17.277
It's time for you to take control.

40:17.279 --> 40:18.946
Take your life back.

40:22.755 --> 40:24.564
Don't you mean we?

43:33.761 --> 43:36.869
You better be calling
to tell me it's done.

43:36.871 --> 43:38.788
Tell me how you know.

43:39.889 --> 43:40.837
Knowledge.

43:40.839 --> 43:43.752
It's a funny thing, Watcher.

43:43.754 --> 43:45.754
What you want me to say?

43:47.991 --> 43:49.544
I know.

43:49.546 --> 43:51.046
There was no mole.

43:52.975 --> 43:53.807
Fine.

43:53.809 --> 43:56.117
There was no mole.

43:56.119 --> 43:59.079
I did that because I knew
the time to disappear

43:59.081 --> 44:00.914
and eliminate Shadows.

44:01.807 --> 44:02.992
Something.

44:02.994 --> 44:06.994
You knew as well but you
were too weak to do it.

44:07.872 --> 44:10.145
I hope you burn in hell.

44:10.147 --> 44:11.632
Hey.

44:11.634 --> 44:15.717
Something tell me that
you will be beat me there.

44:17.940 --> 44:19.023
Don't forget.

44:19.858 --> 44:21.775
Save me a seat, fucker.

44:34.898 --> 44:35.898
Why?

44:37.461 --> 44:40.063
Look, I know you have
a lot of questions.

44:40.065 --> 44:41.065
Why?

44:42.259 --> 44:44.589
Why did you do this to us?

44:44.591 --> 44:46.457
It was Vargas.

44:46.459 --> 44:48.860
He said there was a mole.

44:48.862 --> 44:52.362
My gut told me it couldn't have been true.

44:53.688 --> 44:57.040
I don't know why I
didn't go with it sooner.

44:57.042 --> 44:59.181
Why didn't you vouch for us?

44:59.183 --> 45:01.897
Why did you go along with it?

45:01.899 --> 45:03.149
I don't know.

45:04.224 --> 45:06.905
I didn't know what to believe.

45:06.907 --> 45:09.657
It felt wrong from the beginning.

45:12.996 --> 45:16.340
You were like a father to me.

45:16.342 --> 45:17.675
And you a son.

45:18.724 --> 45:21.342
I see so much of myself in you.

45:21.344 --> 45:26.153
I knew you would be the one
that walked through that door.

45:26.155 --> 45:28.909
This is more than you even realize.

45:28.911 --> 45:29.911
They.

45:30.953 --> 45:31.785
Us.

45:31.787 --> 45:33.749
We were family.

45:33.751 --> 45:34.751
We are.

45:37.838 --> 45:40.662
To die by your hand
would be an honor, son.

45:49.973 --> 45:52.416
Did you mean everything you just said?

45:52.418 --> 45:53.778
Every word.

45:57.265 --> 45:58.625
What's next?

45:58.627 --> 46:00.143
We get Vargas.

46:07.979 --> 46:09.024
Hey yeah, so do you remember

46:09.026 --> 46:10.985
that guy we hit just before we got here?

46:10.987 --> 46:11.819
Totes.

46:11.821 --> 46:13.934
Yeah, but you said I could have that.

46:13.936 --> 46:14.767
I know.

46:14.769 --> 46:15.600
I always do that.

46:15.602 --> 46:16.433
Yeah, yeah you do.

46:16.435 --> 46:17.297
Yeah, you do.

47:37.256 --> 47:38.256
All of 'em.

47:40.810 --> 47:42.141
So what's the plan?

47:42.143 --> 47:44.151
Kill these son of bitches.

47:54.191 --> 47:55.452
Watcher.

48:01.456 --> 48:02.673
Let's go.

50:09.712 --> 50:11.138
Who are they?

50:11.140 --> 50:12.886
The masters.

50:12.888 --> 50:14.139
Don't worry about it.

50:14.141 --> 50:16.211
They won't be a problem.

50:16.213 --> 50:17.880
Just follow my lead.

50:20.267 --> 50:22.725
We have no beef with you.

50:22.727 --> 50:25.894
Just turn a blind eye and let us pass.

50:29.787 --> 50:31.272
I didn't think his head would come off.

50:31.274 --> 50:33.647
I didn't think he was
just gonna stand there.

50:36.531 --> 50:38.281
That was your friend.

51:39.746 --> 51:40.578
So what?

51:40.580 --> 51:42.996
Wanna play hide and seek now?

51:44.421 --> 51:45.421
Little mix.

51:46.864 --> 51:48.636
Can't hide forever.

59:47.380 --> 59:50.557
It is very difficult for me

59:50.559 --> 59:52.226
to step on an insect

59:53.849 --> 59:55.516
without crushing it.

59:58.892 --> 01:00:00.614
I'm what bitch?

01:02:40.229 --> 01:02:41.229
Finally.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.490
Someone worthy.

01:02:46.474 --> 01:02:48.565
You're getting blood on my shirt.

01:05:06.316 --> 01:05:07.316
Wait.

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:10.298
Oh dear.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.467
Don't do that.

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.380
Is it done yet?

01:05:54.934 --> 01:05:56.517
Yeah, it is done.

01:06:07.045 --> 01:06:08.869
That went well.

01:06:08.871 --> 01:06:11.228
I'm glad it's over.

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.230
Over?

01:06:13.573 --> 01:06:14.906
Don't do that.

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.163
Take him out.

01:11:58.294 --> 01:11:59.961
She will do.
