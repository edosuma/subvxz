- Well...

01:13.179 --> 01:16.056
It's a hot goddamn day.

01:17.350 --> 01:19.267
I haven't felt it a bit.

01:19.352 --> 01:22.437
Been inside with the air conditioner
blasting all day long.

01:22.521 --> 01:25.106
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

01:30.154 --> 01:32.405
Didn't you break for lunch or nothin'?

01:32.448 --> 01:35.241
All by myself today.
Ate my lunch out of the microwave.

01:37.411 --> 01:39.996
Jesus H. Christ, Pete.

01:40.081 --> 01:44.250
When you gonna learn that microwave food
will kill you faster than a bullet?

01:44.293 --> 01:47.420
I mean, them damn burritos
ain't good for nothin' but a hippie.

01:47.505 --> 01:49.589
When he's high on weed.

01:51.092 --> 01:54.260
- Pull me down a bottle of that Jack, will ya?
- Yeah.

01:55.763 --> 01:58.556
I think I'm gonna get tanked tonight.

02:02.770 --> 02:05.230
What's the matter?

02:06.816 --> 02:08.483
Yep.

02:08.567 --> 02:12.529
It's been one long, goddamn,
hot, miserable, shit-ass, fuckin' day,

02:12.613 --> 02:15.198
every inch of the way.

02:15.282 --> 02:19.244
First off. Nadine over at Blue Chip
got sort of sick.

02:19.286 --> 02:23.081
So she got that goddamn,
Mongoloid boy of hers workin' the grill.

02:23.124 --> 02:26.960
I mean, that fuckin' idiot
doesn't know rat shit from Rice Krispies.

02:28.087 --> 02:29.963
They eat breakfast about 9:00.

02:30.047 --> 02:32.882
And I'm pukin' up pigs in a blanket,

02:32.967 --> 02:35.760
like a sick, fuckin' dog by 10:30.

02:35.803 --> 02:40.640
Isn't there a law or something
against retards serving food to the public?

02:40.725 --> 02:43.393
Well... If there ain't, there oughta be.

02:43.477 --> 02:45.478
I mean, who in the hell knows
what's goin' on

02:45.521 --> 02:46.813
in the mind of a goddamn Mongoloid?

02:46.897 --> 02:51.234
Nadine should've hit that boy
in the head and sold the fuckin' milk.

02:51.318 --> 02:53.820
You could sue the shit out of her,
you know that?

02:53.904 --> 02:56.656
That kid belongs under a circus tent,
not flippin' burgers.

02:56.699 --> 03:00.827
- You could own that fuckin' place.
- Oh, shit, Pete.

03:00.911 --> 03:03.455
What would I do with that grease pit?

03:03.497 --> 03:07.542
Besides, Nadine's got a cross to bear.

03:07.626 --> 03:11.046
I mean, taking care of that potato head.

03:14.717 --> 03:19.471
I guess you heard about that shit
up in Abilene? Bank robbery?

03:19.513 --> 03:21.806
That's all that's been on the box all day.

03:21.849 --> 03:25.060
They killed some people, didn't they?

03:25.144 --> 03:28.188
Yeah. Killed four Rangers,

03:29.482 --> 03:31.983
three cops,

03:32.026 --> 03:34.944
one civilian.

03:35.029 --> 03:38.198
Took a lady bank teller, hostage with them.

03:39.867 --> 03:43.787
Supposed to be headed for the border,
which'd bring 'em right my way.

03:45.706 --> 03:49.709
If I get my hands on them crazy, sick,
fuckin' bastards, it's payback time.

03:49.752 --> 03:54.506
I mean... Well, we'll get 'em.

03:58.552 --> 03:59.969
We'll get 'em.

04:00.054 --> 04:02.388
Oh, I don't doubt it.

04:02.473 --> 04:04.933
Well...

04:05.017 --> 04:07.685
I gotta drain my lizard.

04:07.728 --> 04:08.728
Mind if I use your commode?

04:09.897 --> 04:11.940
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

04:12.024 --> 04:14.359
You're welcome.

04:23.410 --> 04:25.453
You think I'm fuckin' playin' with you,
asshole?

04:25.538 --> 04:29.082
Do you want this little girl to die?
Or that little girl? Or yourself?

04:29.166 --> 04:32.502
Or your bosom buddy with the badge?
Now, I don't wanna do it.

04:32.586 --> 04:36.714
But I will turn this place into the fucking,
Wild Bunch if I think you are fuckin' with me.

04:36.757 --> 04:38.299
What do you want from me?
I did what you said.

04:38.384 --> 04:40.301
You let him use the bathroom.

04:40.386 --> 04:43.012
- No store does that.
- He comes in here everyday and we bullshit.

04:43.097 --> 04:44.973
He's used my toilet a thousand times.
If I told him no,

04:45.057 --> 04:47.308
- he'd know something was up.
- All right, I want him out of here,

04:47.393 --> 04:51.187
in his car and down the road
or you can change the name of this place

04:51.272 --> 04:53.690
to Benny's Worid of Blood.

05:02.783 --> 05:06.786
- Were you giving that pig signals?
- Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!

05:10.332 --> 05:12.750
- He says you were scratching.
- I wasn't scratchin'!

05:12.793 --> 05:15.628
- Are you callin' him a liar?
- I'm not callin' him a liar, okay?

05:15.713 --> 05:17.964
I'm simply sayin', if I was scratchin',
I don't remember scratchin'.

05:18.007 --> 05:19.549
And If I did scratch,
it's not because I was signaling.

05:19.633 --> 05:20.884
It's because I'm fuckin' scared shitless!

05:22.052 --> 05:24.345
Wait a minute. The guy's in the bathroom.

05:24.430 --> 05:26.472
Why don't I just go back there,
shoot him in the back of the head

05:26.515 --> 05:28.349
- and we can get the hell outta here.
- Don't do that.

05:28.434 --> 05:30.935
Look. You asked me to act natural
and I acted natural.

05:30.978 --> 05:32.312
Under the circumstances, I think I oughta get

05:32.354 --> 05:34.105
a fuckin' Academy Award
for how natural I'm actin'.

05:34.148 --> 05:36.900
You asked me to get rid of him.
I'm doin' my best!

05:38.152 --> 05:41.487
Well, your best better get
a hell of a lot fuckin' better

05:41.572 --> 05:44.782
or you are gonna feel
a hell of a lot fuckin' worse.

05:47.786 --> 05:50.038
Everybody, be cool. You... Be cool.

06:03.427 --> 06:07.513
Yep. Be back at it tomorrow.

06:07.598 --> 06:10.850
Tonight I'm gonna sit in front of that box
and get higher than a Georgia pine.

06:11.977 --> 06:13.937
How much you want for that hooch, Pete?

06:14.021 --> 06:16.814
Oh, $6.50.

06:16.857 --> 06:18.524
Jesus Christ.

06:18.609 --> 06:20.860
- You buckin' for early retirement?
- Shit, yeah.

06:24.156 --> 06:26.199
Hey! Hey!

06:26.283 --> 06:28.993
- What the fuck is that about?
- He signaled the Ranger.

06:29.036 --> 06:31.663
I didn't! Ya gotta believe me! I didn't!

06:31.705 --> 06:34.165
When they were talking,
he mouthed the words, "Help us."

06:34.208 --> 06:36.960
- You fuckin' liar! I didn't say shit!
- Oh, just shut the hell up!

06:38.087 --> 06:41.339
Hey! You stop it!
What the fuck is your problem?

06:41.382 --> 06:45.051
- Goddamn it.
- Seth, he did it!

06:45.135 --> 06:47.387
You were by the beer cooler
with your back turned.

06:47.429 --> 06:49.889
I was by the magazines. I could see his face!

06:49.932 --> 06:53.268
And I saw him mouth the words, "Help us."

06:54.478 --> 06:57.063
Start the car.

06:57.147 --> 07:00.233
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yes. Shut up and start the car, all right.

07:00.276 --> 07:01.359
Start the car.
- You believe me?

07:01.402 --> 07:04.737
Start the car. You know that?
Shut the fuck up and start the car.

07:04.780 --> 07:07.240
Wait a minute.
- I believe you. Start the car!

07:07.283 --> 07:08.908
You're not just saying that?

07:08.951 --> 07:10.660
- You do believe me?
- I believe you! Let's go!

07:10.744 --> 07:12.829
- That means you believe me.
- Yes, I believe you!

07:12.913 --> 07:15.665
You should, because I'm right.

07:27.594 --> 07:29.762
- Richie!
- Yeah?

07:30.889 --> 07:35.184
- You okay?
- He shot me in the fucking hand!

07:35.269 --> 07:39.856
- Like I told you he said "Help us."
- I never said, "Help us"!

07:39.940 --> 07:43.276
Well, that doesn't matter now, because you
got about two fuckin' seconds to live!

07:45.988 --> 07:47.989
- Richie?
- Yeah?

07:48.073 --> 07:51.159
When I count to three,
you shoot the bottles out from behind him.

07:51.243 --> 07:53.619
Oh, yeah!

07:53.662 --> 07:57.040
- One...
- Fuck!

07:57.124 --> 07:58.624
Two...

08:02.129 --> 08:03.546
Three!

08:56.850 --> 08:58.810
What did I tell you? What did I say to you?

08:58.852 --> 09:00.645
I said, "Buy the roadmap and leave."

09:00.687 --> 09:02.188
What the fuck am I supposed to do, Seth?

09:02.231 --> 09:04.399
- He recognized us.
- He didn't recognize shit.

09:04.483 --> 09:06.526
Seth, I'm telling you,
the way he looked at us.

09:06.568 --> 09:09.195
You, especially, I knew he knew.

09:09.279 --> 09:13.366
Low profile! Do you understand
the meaning of the words "low profile"?

09:13.409 --> 09:16.119
"Hey, Richie, how's your hand?"
"It hurts like a fuckin' son of a bitch!

09:16.203 --> 09:18.704
"Thanks for askin'."
- Let me tell you what "low profile" is not.

09:18.789 --> 09:23.042
It is not taking giris hostage.
It is not shooting police.

09:23.085 --> 09:27.922
- It is not setting fire to a building.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

09:40.602 --> 09:44.647
Hot air hangs like a dead man

09:44.731 --> 09:47.316
From a white oak tree

09:48.444 --> 09:51.612
People sittin' on porches

09:51.697 --> 09:54.490
Thinkin' how things used to be

09:54.575 --> 09:57.660
Dark night

09:57.744 --> 09:59.745
It's a dark night

10:01.790 --> 10:03.708
Dark night

10:05.085 --> 10:07.170
It's a dark night

11:35.467 --> 11:37.552
My wife left home about a week ago

11:38.679 --> 11:40.972
She stole the kids
and she took all my dough

11:44.268 --> 11:48.604
Oh, screw it! Goddamn you! Goddamn you!

11:50.732 --> 11:52.692
What the hell do you want?

11:52.776 --> 11:56.195
What do you think I want, you mean,
old bastard? I want a fuckin' room.

11:57.322 --> 11:58.656
Okay, all right.

12:01.243 --> 12:03.911
She peed on the carpet
She shot my horse

12:03.996 --> 12:06.747
Now things are goin'
from better to bad to worse

12:07.583 --> 12:11.127
- Do they have cable?
- No.

12:13.046 --> 12:16.841
- Do they have the X-rated channel?
No.

12:16.883 --> 12:19.927
Do they have a water bed?
- Nope.

12:20.012 --> 12:22.221
- What do they got?
- They have four walls and a roof

12:22.306 --> 12:23.889
and that's all we need.

12:34.568 --> 12:36.736
All right, pop the trunk.
Let's do this fast.

12:45.621 --> 12:47.371
Oh.

12:47.414 --> 12:48.414
Don't say a word.

12:52.461 --> 12:54.545
You, plant yourself in that seat.

12:57.591 --> 13:01.636
- What are you gonna do with me?
- I said "plant yourself." Plants don't talk.

13:01.720 --> 13:05.931
Now, you wanna get on my good side?
You sit still and you don't make a peep.

13:11.563 --> 13:13.105
All right, how does this feel?

13:13.190 --> 13:15.232
How do you think?
It hurts like a son of a bitch.

13:20.238 --> 13:22.615
- It's wrapped too tight. Nice and easy.
- Okay.

13:22.699 --> 13:24.950
All right. Okay, I'm gonna go get the money.

13:45.222 --> 13:49.308
It's 6:00.
What time's it get dark around here?

13:49.351 --> 13:50.935
- About 8:00.
- Good.

13:50.977 --> 13:53.646
I'm goin' to the border, check things out.
I'm gonna call Carlos,

13:53.730 --> 13:56.232
try and arrange some sort of a rendezvous.
I don't know what.

13:56.316 --> 13:58.693
Could you see if he could arrange
a better deal than 30%?

13:58.777 --> 14:00.903
It's their standard deal.
They're not gonna change that for us.

14:00.987 --> 14:03.656
- Did you even try and negotiate with them?
- Richie.

14:03.740 --> 14:07.618
These guys are not spic firecracker salesmen
from Tijuana.

14:07.661 --> 14:10.329
They don't even know the meaning
of the word "barter."

14:10.372 --> 14:14.792
You wanna stay in El Rey, you give them
30% of your loot. It's scripture.

14:14.835 --> 14:17.962
So it is written, so shall it be done.
Yeah, I know, listen.

14:18.004 --> 14:23.008
Hey, you want sanctuary,
you gotta pay the price. The price is 30%.

14:23.093 --> 14:25.678
- All I'm sayin', man...
- This conversation's over.

14:27.597 --> 14:29.140
Okay?

14:32.853 --> 14:34.520
We need to have a talk.

14:35.313 --> 14:37.523
- What's your name?
- Gloria.

14:37.607 --> 14:39.692
Hello, Gloria. I'm Seth.
That's my brother Richie.

14:39.735 --> 14:41.569
Let's cut to the chase.

14:41.653 --> 14:45.072
I'm gonna ask you one question
and all I want is a yes or no answer.

14:46.032 --> 14:48.868
Do you wanna live through this?

14:48.910 --> 14:50.703
- Yes.
- Good.

14:50.746 --> 14:55.082
Rule number one. No noise. No questions.

14:55.167 --> 15:00.713
If you make a noise, Mr. 44 makes a noise.

15:00.797 --> 15:04.216
If you ask a question, Mr. 44 answers it.

15:04.259 --> 15:08.846
Now are you absolutely,
positively clear about rule number one?

15:10.307 --> 15:12.892
- Yes.
- Rule number two.

15:12.976 --> 15:15.144
You do what we say, when we say it.

15:15.228 --> 15:17.897
If you don't, see rule number one.

15:18.857 --> 15:23.277
Rule number three.
Don't you ever try and fucking run on us,

15:23.361 --> 15:29.366
'cause I got six little friends
and they can all run faster than you can.

15:31.077 --> 15:32.495
Open your eyes.

15:34.998 --> 15:38.375
Gloria, you hang in there,
you follow the rules.

15:38.418 --> 15:41.837
And you don't fuck with us
and you'll get out of this alive.

15:42.506 --> 15:45.007
- I give you my word.
- Okay.

15:53.642 --> 15:55.392
I'll be back in a minute.

16:10.283 --> 16:12.952
You wanna come over on the bed
and watch TV with me?

16:32.389 --> 16:34.056
Hail!

16:34.140 --> 16:35.516
Come on.

16:47.487 --> 16:49.113
Have a seat.

16:57.497 --> 16:58.914
Take off your shoes.

17:15.515 --> 17:19.059
You got about two more hours

17:19.144 --> 17:22.271
until we get into El Paso

17:22.355 --> 17:25.023
which is right next to the border.

17:25.066 --> 17:26.901
Then we'll stop at a motel.

17:26.984 --> 17:27.984
Stop?

17:28.028 --> 17:30.362
We're not actually gonna
stop at a motel, are we?

17:30.447 --> 17:33.282
Yeah, what for? We have a motor home.

17:33.366 --> 17:37.119
We don't wanna stay in
those roach-haven motels, do we?

17:37.203 --> 17:38.954
- We're self-contained.
- We're self-contained.

17:39.039 --> 17:40.539
Okay, okay.

17:40.582 --> 17:45.044
Maybe I was a little overzealous.
But gimme a break, I just bought it.

17:45.128 --> 17:48.964
- How come you wanna stop anyways, Dad?
- I'm exhausted.

17:49.049 --> 17:53.135
Exhausted? Just lie in the back, Dad.
I can drive us into Mexico.

17:53.219 --> 17:56.555
I just bet you would.
Don't even think about it.

17:56.598 --> 17:59.850
Besides, I wanna have

17:59.893 --> 18:02.937
just one night's sleep
in an honest to goodness bed.

18:03.021 --> 18:07.107
The beds in the home are okay, but...

18:07.192 --> 18:10.235
They're not like a real bed.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.113
Excuse me. I have to use the restroom.

18:23.583 --> 18:27.378
Oh, guess what? When I called
the machine to check the messages,

18:28.254 --> 18:30.839
one of them was from Bethel Baptist.

18:30.924 --> 18:33.384
And Mr. Franklin said that

18:33.426 --> 18:37.554
he wouldn't permanently replace you
until we came back.

18:37.597 --> 18:40.933
- And he said that...
- That's very nice of Ted.

18:40.976 --> 18:44.061
But I'll call him tomorrow
and tell him not to bother waiting.

18:50.318 --> 18:56.407
Daddy, I didn't wanna talk about this
in front of Scott because he gets upset.

18:57.283 --> 18:58.993
But I just wanna know.

19:00.286 --> 19:02.746
Don't you believe in God anymore?

19:04.290 --> 19:07.001
Not enough to be a pastor.

19:08.128 --> 19:12.464
Look, I know this is hard on you kids.

19:12.507 --> 19:16.427
But after Jenny's death, this is
probably the last thing you need,

19:16.469 --> 19:21.181
but my congregation
needs spiritual leadership.

19:21.266 --> 19:24.351
Well... My faith is gone.

19:24.436 --> 19:29.606
To answer your question.
Yes, I do believe in Jesus.

19:29.649 --> 19:33.652
Yes, I do believe in God.

19:33.695 --> 19:37.031
But do I love them?

19:37.115 --> 19:39.158
No.

19:39.242 --> 19:43.746
Well, it's just
that all our lives, you've been a pastor.

19:43.830 --> 19:48.959
And then, one day you're just
gonna wake up and say, "Fuck him"?

19:50.503 --> 19:52.463
I didn't say, "Fuck him."

19:54.883 --> 19:57.676
Every person who

19:57.761 --> 20:03.015
chooses the service of God
as his life's work has something in common.

20:03.099 --> 20:06.060
I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest,

20:06.144 --> 20:09.021
a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk.

20:09.064 --> 20:14.568
Many, many times during your life,
you'll look at your reflection in the mirror

20:14.652 --> 20:16.862
and ask yourself,

20:16.905 --> 20:20.032
"Am I a fool?"

20:20.116 --> 20:22.868
I'm not going through a lapse.

20:22.911 --> 20:26.538
What I've experienced is closer to awakening.

20:27.874 --> 20:30.834
But Daddy,

20:30.877 --> 20:33.420
what do you think Mom would say?

20:33.505 --> 20:37.925
Mama's got nothin' to say. She's dead.

20:40.220 --> 20:43.889
This bloody crime spree
started just a week ago today.

20:43.973 --> 20:46.934
The oldest of the two brothers, Seth Gecko,

20:47.018 --> 20:50.562
was serving time in Roll
Kansas State Penitent

20:50.605 --> 20:54.149
for his part in the 1988
Scott City bank robbery

20:54.234 --> 20:57.236
in which two law enforcement
officers lost their lives.

20:57.320 --> 21:02.407
It was while at the courthouse that this man,
his younger brother, Richard Gecko,

21:02.492 --> 21:07.579
a known armed robber and sex offender
pulled off a daring daylight escape,

21:07.664 --> 21:12.960
resulting in the death of four Wichita
law enforcement officers and this woman,

21:13.044 --> 21:16.630
Heidi Vogel, sixth grade teacher,
who was run over by the Geckos

21:16.714 --> 21:19.716
during a high-speed pursuit
through downtown Wichita.

21:19.759 --> 21:23.971
And earlier today, during a daylight
liquor store robbery in Big Springs,

21:24.055 --> 21:27.933
the Gecko brothers killed
another Texas Ranger,

21:28.017 --> 21:31.270
Earl McGraw and liquor store clerk,
Pete Bottoms.

21:31.354 --> 21:34.356
That changes the death toll to 16.

21:34.440 --> 21:38.694
Five Texas Rangers,
eight police officers, three civilians

21:38.778 --> 21:42.906
and one hostage,
bank teller and mother of four, Gloria Hi

21:42.949 --> 21:46.118
For the time being, we're very confident
that we'll apprehend these fugitives

21:46.202 --> 21:48.120
within the next 48 hours.

21:48.204 --> 21:51.248
The Bureau, local law enforcement
and the Texas Rangers

21:51.291 --> 21:56.128
have all joined in forming a dragnet
to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.

21:56.171 --> 21:59.131
Is it safe to assume that because of
the death count involved

21:59.215 --> 22:02.384
and the loss of life
of law enforcement officers,

22:02.468 --> 22:04.636
that the Bureau, the Rangers
and the police force

22:04.721 --> 22:07.306
are taking this manhunt personally?

22:07.390 --> 22:10.309
I would say that's a very safe assumption.

22:24.824 --> 22:27.659
Shit, I was really worried.
Where the fuck you been, man?

22:27.702 --> 22:30.412
- Sightseeing.
- What'd you see?

22:30.496 --> 22:31.663
The cops.

22:31.706 --> 22:34.208
- Did you see the border?
- Yes, I saw the border.

22:34.292 --> 22:35.834
What'd the TV say?

22:35.877 --> 22:39.421
They're gonna apprehend us
in about 48 hours.

22:39.505 --> 22:42.090
I gotta figure out a way
to get us across this goddamn border.

22:42.175 --> 22:47.429
The longer we stay here,
our lives ain't worth shit. Here you go.

22:47.513 --> 22:50.140
We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight.

22:50.183 --> 22:53.602
Then Carlos is gonna meet us there
at the rendezvous tomorrow morning.

22:53.686 --> 22:59.024
He and his boys,
all of them are gonna escort us into El Rey.

22:59.108 --> 23:00.984
And...

23:03.571 --> 23:05.739
- Where's the woman?
- What?

23:05.823 --> 23:08.742
What do you mean, what? The woman.
The hostage, the fuckin' hostage.

23:08.826 --> 23:10.911
Richard, where is she?

23:12.538 --> 23:13.664
She's in there.

23:13.706 --> 23:16.917
- What the fuck is she doin' in there?
- Seth, wait a minute.

23:17.001 --> 23:18.919
Seth.

23:28.554 --> 23:32.266
Richard, what's wrong with you?

23:32.350 --> 23:33.433
Before you flip out, okay,

23:33.518 --> 23:37.187
- let me just explain what happened.
- Explain to me.

23:37.230 --> 23:41.400
I need an explanation.
What is the matter with you?

23:41.442 --> 23:43.402
There's nothing wrong with me, Brother.

23:43.486 --> 23:45.529
That woman tried to escape
and I did what I had to.

23:45.571 --> 23:48.407
No, the woman wouldn't have
said shit if she had a mouth full of it.

23:48.449 --> 23:50.659
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

23:50.743 --> 23:52.661
- Yeah.
- After you left,

23:52.745 --> 23:56.707
- she became a completely different person.
- Yeah.

23:58.251 --> 24:02.504
Is it me? Is it my fault?

24:02.588 --> 24:04.923
- It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

24:05.008 --> 24:08.260
- No, it's her fault. It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

24:08.303 --> 24:12.055
- Do you think that this is what I am?
- I don't.

24:12.098 --> 24:15.726
This is not me.
I am a professional fucking thief.

24:15.768 --> 24:20.272
I don't kill people that I don't have to
and I don't fucking rape women.

24:20.356 --> 24:23.442
What you are doing...
What you are fucking doing...

24:23.484 --> 24:27.821
What you are doing is not how it's done.
Do you understand that? Do you?

24:27.905 --> 24:31.825
Just say, "Fucking yes."
Say, "Yes, Seth, I understand."

24:31.909 --> 24:32.909
Yes, Seth, I understand.

24:32.952 --> 24:35.454
Say it. Say, "Yes, Seth,
I fucking understand!"

24:35.496 --> 24:38.749
I understand, Seth. I fucking understand.

24:44.130 --> 24:46.340
We'll get to Mexico and
it's gonna be sweet rosemary

24:46.424 --> 24:48.050
and a hundred proof liquor...

24:49.177 --> 24:52.387
...and rice and beans and none
of this shit's gonna matter.

25:01.356 --> 25:04.983
I can't believe he's stoppin' here.
This place is totally cruddy.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.159
Dad, why are we stoppin' here?

25:16.120 --> 25:19.289
There's nothin' wrong with this place.

25:19.332 --> 25:22.084
It's a flophouse.

25:22.168 --> 25:25.337
It's not a flophouse.

25:25.421 --> 25:28.173
It's basic and it's simple.

25:28.216 --> 25:31.218
That doesn't make it a flophouse.

25:31.302 --> 25:34.096
All right. Well, if it doesn't have a pool,

25:34.180 --> 25:36.973
then we're goin' someplace else.

25:38.226 --> 25:40.185
It has a bed.

25:40.269 --> 25:43.146
That's all I care about.

25:43.189 --> 25:45.690
Well, other places have beds, too,

25:45.775 --> 25:48.735
and they also have a gym...

25:57.245 --> 26:00.789
Geez, what is this guy's problem?

26:00.873 --> 26:03.250
No idea.

26:07.547 --> 26:10.132
Creepy guy.

26:24.856 --> 26:25.856
What?

26:25.898 --> 26:29.818
Yes, I'm your neighbor
from room 11

26:29.902 --> 26:33.905
and I hate to disturb you,
but I'd like to ask a favor.

26:41.664 --> 26:44.082
I hope none of this is disturbin' you.

26:52.091 --> 26:54.050
Hi. I'm from room 11.

26:54.093 --> 26:58.054
And me and my lady friend need some ice
and we don't seem to have an ice bucket.

26:58.097 --> 27:03.101
If it's not too much trouble, could I possibly
borrow yours? I'll bring it right back.

27:06.272 --> 27:08.190
- Sure.
- Thank you.

27:15.656 --> 27:16.698
What is this?

27:18.868 --> 27:20.535
It's called a punch.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.662
Lose the guitar.

27:26.125 --> 27:27.792
What's your name?

27:27.877 --> 27:29.961
- Jacob.
- Jacob, get up. Get on the bed.

27:30.046 --> 27:33.465
If you make a wrong move,
I will shoot you in the face.

27:33.508 --> 27:34.549
Open your mouth.

27:34.634 --> 27:35.842
Wide!

27:37.970 --> 27:40.472
Let's go.
Let's move the Jap over here, too. Let's go.

27:49.232 --> 27:52.734
So what's the story with you two?
You a couple of fags?

27:52.818 --> 27:53.985
He's my son.

27:54.070 --> 27:56.446
How's that happened?
You don't look Japanese.

27:56.489 --> 28:00.033
Neither does he. He looks Chinese.

28:00.660 --> 28:03.328
Oh, ooh, well, excuse me all to hell.

28:05.289 --> 28:08.625
- What's this about, money?
- It's about money, all right, but not yours.

28:08.668 --> 28:12.295
My brother and I, we're in a little hot water
and we need your assistance.

28:14.423 --> 28:15.423
Stop!

28:16.342 --> 28:19.010
What's goin' on?

28:19.095 --> 28:22.430
We're having a bikini contest
and you just won.

28:22.515 --> 28:25.392
It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

28:25.476 --> 28:28.395
Just listen to your daddy, sugar,
and you don't do anything stupid.

28:28.479 --> 28:31.189
You two, Simon says, sit the fuck down.

28:31.274 --> 28:33.024
Sit down.

28:35.861 --> 28:38.572
Now, where are the keys
to the motor home?

28:39.031 --> 28:41.741
- On the dresser.
- Good. All right.

28:41.826 --> 28:46.621
Richie, you take these keys, you start
this big bastard up and drive it up front.

28:50.376 --> 28:55.422
Richie, would you do me a favor
and eat my pussy for me? Please?

28:55.506 --> 28:59.884
- Sure.
- Richie, hey!

28:59.969 --> 29:02.095
Not when you get around to it. Now.

29:14.233 --> 29:17.944
You, Gidget, go in the bathroom
and put on some clothes.

29:20.031 --> 29:23.199
You got three minutes. One second longer,
I shoot your father in the face.

29:23.242 --> 29:25.410
- Do you understand what I just said?
- Yes.

29:25.494 --> 29:26.995
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

29:27.079 --> 29:29.748
You damn well better. Go.

29:44.930 --> 29:47.307
Look, if you want the motor home,

29:47.391 --> 29:49.392
just take it and get out.

29:49.435 --> 29:53.938
It's not gonna be that easy, Pops.
We're gonna go on a little ride.

29:57.026 --> 29:59.069
Not a chance.

30:00.863 --> 30:04.574
- Come again?
- If you're takin' people, take me.

30:07.370 --> 30:10.789
But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.

30:10.831 --> 30:13.583
Sorry, Pops. I need everybody.

30:13.626 --> 30:16.961
My children are not goin' with you
and that's that.

30:17.046 --> 30:21.549
That's not fucking that. This is fucking this.

30:21.634 --> 30:23.218
Dad.

30:24.804 --> 30:27.263
You sit down. Sit down.

30:28.683 --> 30:30.975
You, go sit over there.
Go sit over there, now. Move it.

30:31.018 --> 30:32.811
Sit down.

30:37.066 --> 30:40.026
Now, I don't have time to fuck around,
so I'm gonna make this simple.

30:40.111 --> 30:42.612
You take your kids
and you get in that motor home

30:42.655 --> 30:45.573
or I will execute all three of you right now.

30:48.244 --> 30:51.371
So, what's it gonna be?

30:51.455 --> 30:53.540
Yes or no, answer.

30:54.834 --> 30:56.334
Yes.

30:56.377 --> 30:58.962
Hey, your old man's all right.
He just saved your life.

31:01.465 --> 31:04.509
Time's up, princess. Here we go.

31:05.511 --> 31:08.179
Okay, ramblers, let's get rambling.

31:22.153 --> 31:23.528
Excuse me.

31:24.530 --> 31:25.905
What?

31:27.241 --> 31:31.202
- Where are you takin' us?
- Mexico.

31:31.245 --> 31:33.204
What's in Mexico?

31:34.039 --> 31:35.540
Mexicans.

31:37.501 --> 31:40.336
- Richie?
- Yeah?

31:41.630 --> 31:43.214
Put in your bit.

31:58.856 --> 32:01.566
I grind my teeth.

32:03.444 --> 32:05.487
What are their names?

32:05.571 --> 32:08.281
- Scott and Kate.
- Scott and Kate.

32:08.365 --> 32:10.533
Who's this?

32:12.661 --> 32:15.455
- My wife.
- Where is the little lady?

32:17.541 --> 32:21.753
- In heaven.
- She dead?

32:21.837 --> 32:23.463
Yes, she is.

32:23.547 --> 32:26.633
How'd she die?

32:26.717 --> 32:28.718
Auto wreck.

32:30.429 --> 32:32.138
Come on, Jacob. Gimme some more details.

32:32.223 --> 32:35.934
How'd it happen?
Some fucking drunk kill her?

32:35.976 --> 32:39.145
No. It was a rainy night.

32:41.106 --> 32:44.400
The brakes on the car weren't great.

32:44.443 --> 32:47.403
She had to stop suddenly.

32:47.446 --> 32:51.199
She slid on the road. She crashed. She died.

32:51.283 --> 32:54.285
- She died right away?
- Not quite.

32:55.329 --> 32:59.541
She was trapped in the wreck
for about six hours

32:59.625 --> 33:02.335
before she passed on.

33:02.419 --> 33:07.757
Yep. Those acts of God really stick
it in and break it off, don't they?

33:07.800 --> 33:10.552
Yes, they do.

33:10.636 --> 33:13.137
Is that real?

33:13.180 --> 33:16.808
- Yes.
- I've seen one of these things before.

33:16.851 --> 33:20.645
A friend of mine had himself ordained,
a minister of his own religion.

33:20.688 --> 33:23.982
Some way to fuck the IRS.

33:24.066 --> 33:26.317
Is that what you're doing
or are you the real McCoy?

33:27.069 --> 33:29.112
The real McCoy?

33:30.447 --> 33:31.656
You're a preacher?

33:32.825 --> 33:34.784
I was a minister.

33:35.661 --> 33:37.996
"Was" as in not anymore?

33:38.038 --> 33:40.081
- Yes.
- Why'd you quit?

33:40.165 --> 33:41.666
I think I've gotten about

33:41.750 --> 33:44.836
as up close and personal with you
as I'm gonna get.

33:44.879 --> 33:49.799
Let's just keep this friendly, okay, Pops?
Let's not get too sensitive.

33:51.802 --> 33:56.222
You're right. Enough with
the gettin' to know you shit. All right.

33:56.307 --> 33:58.933
I don't give a rat's ass about you
or your fuckin' family.

33:59.018 --> 34:02.979
You can all live forever
or you can die this second.

34:03.022 --> 34:05.189
And I don't give a shit which.

34:05.232 --> 34:07.317
The only things that I care about are me,

34:07.359 --> 34:09.652
that son of a bitch back there in the back
and our money.

34:09.695 --> 34:13.156
So you help us get across the border
without incident.

34:13.197 --> 34:15.867
You stay with us through the night
without trying anything funny,

34:15.951 --> 34:17.827
without trying to escape.

34:17.870 --> 34:21.164
And in the morning,
I'm gonna let you guys go, all of you.

34:21.206 --> 34:23.708
How do I know you'll keep your word?

34:23.751 --> 34:26.210
You have to convince me
you're tellin' the truth.

34:26.295 --> 34:29.130
Look, dickhead, the only thing
that you have to be convinced about

34:29.214 --> 34:33.551
is the fact that you are stuck in a situation
with a couple of real mean motor scooters.

34:33.594 --> 34:36.679
And I don't want to have
to worry about you all fuckin' night.

34:36.722 --> 34:39.681
You know, I don't think you wanna be
worrying about my brother's intentions

34:39.725 --> 34:42.936
towards your daughter all night, either.

34:43.020 --> 34:44.687
Did you notice the way
he was looking at her?

34:44.730 --> 34:45.772
Yes.

34:45.856 --> 34:47.774
- You didn't like it, did you?
- No, I didn't.

34:47.858 --> 34:50.902
I didn't think so. You get us into Mexico

34:50.985 --> 34:55.031
and you don't try to escape
and your daughter will be safe.

34:55.074 --> 34:59.118
And in the morning, I will let you go.
I give you my word, Jacob.

35:02.414 --> 35:05.917
If he touches her, I'll kill him!

35:05.960 --> 35:09.712
Fair enough.
You break your word, I'll kill all of ya.

35:14.385 --> 35:17.261
You got me all crazy

35:18.222 --> 35:20.390
I can't get outta bed

35:22.434 --> 35:25.603
Bones are achin'

35:25.688 --> 35:28.523
Backed up in my head

35:30.484 --> 35:32.610
Dengue woman

35:35.447 --> 35:38.324
Stay away from me

35:46.417 --> 35:48.918
You got your aches and pains

35:51.463 --> 35:55.174
Over me

36:04.727 --> 36:08.021
Did you mean what you said
back there in the room?

36:09.982 --> 36:11.566
What?

36:14.319 --> 36:16.821
In the room?

36:16.905 --> 36:19.490
Did you mean what you said back there,
or were you just foolin' around?

36:19.575 --> 36:24.829
Because if you really want me to do that
for you, I will. I'd be happy to.

36:27.124 --> 36:31.169
- Do what?
- What you said back there in the room?

36:31.211 --> 36:33.463
What did I say?

36:34.506 --> 36:37.341
- You asked me if I would eat...
Richie.

36:37.384 --> 36:38.384
What?

36:38.469 --> 36:41.262
I told you to watch those kids.
Not to talk to them.

36:41.346 --> 36:44.724
You don't have nothin' to say
to one another. So let's just cut the chatter.

36:47.394 --> 36:49.353
We'll talk later. Okay?

37:15.547 --> 37:17.215
All right, everybody. It's show time.

37:17.299 --> 37:21.761
Richie, you take Kate into the bathroom.
Scott, get up here with your dad. Let's go.

37:24.014 --> 37:26.390
Now, what are you gonna say?

37:28.060 --> 37:30.061
I don't have the slightest idea.

37:30.104 --> 37:33.189
Just keep thinking about the gun
next to Kate's head.

37:35.067 --> 37:36.651
Get in.

37:46.578 --> 37:47.745
This isn't gonna work, Seth.

37:47.830 --> 37:50.748
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine.

37:51.917 --> 37:54.085
Hey, what are you gonna do?

37:55.129 --> 37:57.922
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.

37:58.006 --> 38:00.925
Dad, you have to tell them
that they're back there.

38:01.009 --> 38:02.927
Have you forgotten about your sister?

38:03.345 --> 38:06.556
I want to go on record right now
as saying that this is a very bad idea.

38:06.598 --> 38:08.599
Duly noted. Now shut up.

38:09.810 --> 38:13.563
Oh, my God. Look over here.
Step right over there.

38:14.606 --> 38:18.025
They're gonna kill us, Dad.
They're gonna get us across the border,

38:18.110 --> 38:20.778
take us out in the desert,
then they're gonna fuckin' shoot us.

38:20.821 --> 38:23.281
If they get over the border,
they're gonna let us go.

38:23.323 --> 38:28.911
No, they won't. Dad, come on. I watch those
reality shows. They never let anybody go.

38:28.954 --> 38:32.790
Any cop'll tell you, in a situation like this,
you get a chance, you go for it.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.917
It may not seem like it,
but I know exactly what I'm doing.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.294
You're gonna have to trust me on this.

38:36.378 --> 38:38.171
I can't do that, Dad.

38:38.630 --> 38:40.756
If you don't tell the cops, I will.

38:40.799 --> 38:42.300
Now listen to me!

38:42.342 --> 38:45.094
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing!
You hear me?

38:47.598 --> 38:49.724
I'm running the show! I make the decisions!

38:49.808 --> 38:51.434
He is running the show.

38:51.476 --> 38:53.519
- I'm running the show! I'm running the show!
- Dad!

38:55.314 --> 38:57.648
Shh. I make the plays.

38:58.483 --> 38:59.567
You back the plays I make.

39:01.486 --> 39:03.154
I need your cover.

39:04.573 --> 39:05.573
Cover me.

39:11.455 --> 39:13.122
How many with you?

39:13.790 --> 39:14.957
Just my son and I.

39:16.501 --> 39:18.669
What's your purpose in Mexico?

39:18.754 --> 39:22.632
Vacation. I'm taking him
to see his first bullfight.

39:23.258 --> 39:24.675
They're gonna search the van.

39:24.718 --> 39:29.013
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut,
we're gonna be just fine.

39:29.598 --> 39:32.475
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

39:32.517 --> 39:34.727
- What?
- You just called me a fuckin' nut.

39:34.811 --> 39:36.896
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

39:36.980 --> 39:39.440
You said, "As long as
I don't act like a fucking nut"

39:39.524 --> 39:41.359
implying that I've been acting
like a fucking nut.

39:41.443 --> 39:43.527
Take a pill, all right. I just meant be cool.

39:43.570 --> 39:45.571
Yeah, you meant that,
but you meant the other, too.

39:45.656 --> 39:48.115
This is not the time, Richie.

39:48.200 --> 39:52.662
Hey, fuck those spic pigs, man!
You called me a "fucking nut."

39:52.704 --> 39:54.705
Now, where I come from,
that stops the train in its tracks.

39:54.748 --> 39:56.707
Keep your fucking voice down.

39:56.750 --> 39:57.917
Or what?

39:59.878 --> 40:01.712
- What was that?
- Hmm?

40:03.215 --> 40:07.051
Oh! That was just...
Just my daughter in the bathroom.

40:07.844 --> 40:10.930
I thought you said
it was just you and your son?

40:11.974 --> 40:15.101
Um, I meant me and my son
and my daughter.

40:17.229 --> 40:19.272
Open up. I'm comin' aboard.

40:25.737 --> 40:29.365
What was the nuttiest thing I did, Seth?
I'm curious. Tell me. What was it?

40:29.408 --> 40:31.701
- This is not the time, Richie.
- I know.

40:31.743 --> 40:34.328
Was it possibly when your ass
was rotting in jail and I broke it out?

40:34.413 --> 40:35.413
Is that the nuttiest thing?

40:35.455 --> 40:38.249
That was nutty, huh? Not to mention stupid.

40:42.754 --> 40:44.005
Thanks.

40:59.646 --> 41:01.105
I'm in the bathroom.

41:01.189 --> 41:02.982
Open up. It's Border Patrol.

41:03.066 --> 41:04.650
It's open.

41:09.281 --> 41:13.451
Do you mind? Shut the fuckin' door, please!

41:15.162 --> 41:16.495
Excuse me.

41:29.301 --> 41:31.469
Goddamn, that was intense!

41:37.768 --> 41:39.810
Oh, baby, we did it. We're in Mexico.

41:39.853 --> 41:43.689
We're fuckin' in Mexico,
you little piece of fuckin' shit!

41:43.774 --> 41:45.816
Come on! Kate, get out here.

41:50.572 --> 41:52.656
All right, listen up. Everybody, listen.

41:52.699 --> 41:54.492
Now I know that I put you all through hell,

41:54.576 --> 41:57.119
and I know that I have been
one rough pecker.

41:57.162 --> 42:00.956
But from here on out,
you guys are all in my cool book.

42:00.999 --> 42:04.210
Scotty, I want you to help me with Richie.
We'll lay him down on the couch over there.

42:04.294 --> 42:06.462
Jacob, you're gonna keep
driving down this street

42:06.505 --> 42:08.672
until you come to another street
called De Gallo.

42:08.757 --> 42:12.009
When you get to De Gallo,
you're gonna turn this big bastard left,

42:12.094 --> 42:15.805
and you're gonna go down a couple of miles
until you see a bar called the Titty Twister.

42:15.847 --> 42:17.598
From what I understand, you cannot miss it.

42:17.682 --> 42:18.682
Then?

42:18.725 --> 42:22.019
And then you stop because
that's where we're going.

42:36.701 --> 42:38.702
Don't make a career out of this, okay?

42:38.787 --> 42:39.870
Come on, hey.

42:41.206 --> 42:42.915
Hey, you okay?

42:45.043 --> 42:48.087
Yeah, I think so. What happened?

42:48.171 --> 42:50.506
I don't know. You just passed out.

42:50.549 --> 42:51.549
I did?

42:51.633 --> 42:53.592
Mmm-hmm. You said something
about your hand hurtin'

42:53.677 --> 42:55.261
and then you just hit the ground
like a sack of potatoes.

42:56.388 --> 42:58.013
Really?

42:58.056 --> 43:00.850
Head hit the toilet.
You scared the shit out of me.

43:00.892 --> 43:02.977
You sure you're okay?

43:04.104 --> 43:07.940
Yeah. I think so. I'm just a little fucked up.

43:08.024 --> 43:12.570
Well, let me tell you something
that's gonna clear your head right up.

43:12.654 --> 43:13.737
What?

43:13.780 --> 43:16.282
We are officially Mexicans.

43:17.284 --> 43:20.411
We're in Mexico, buddy.

43:20.454 --> 43:21.454
- We are?
- Yeah.

43:21.538 --> 43:23.080
We're heading down to
the rendezvous right now.

43:23.123 --> 43:25.458
We're gonna pound booze, wait for Carlos.

43:25.542 --> 43:28.252
When he gets there,
he's gonna take us down to El Rey.

43:28.295 --> 43:32.673
And then you and I, my brother,
we're gonna kick fuckin' back.

43:32.757 --> 43:35.259
- How do you like them apples?
- Far out.

43:39.014 --> 43:40.222
Where's my glasses?

43:40.265 --> 43:43.893
Oh, uh... Yeah, they broke when you fell.

43:46.104 --> 43:47.855
Fuck, Seth, these are like my only pair!

43:47.939 --> 43:49.690
Don't worry about it.
We'll get you another pair.

43:49.774 --> 43:51.942
Of course I'm gonna worry about it.
I can't fuckin' see!

43:52.027 --> 43:53.569
I'll take care of it when we get to El Rey.

43:53.612 --> 43:55.279
Yeah, like some Mexican hole in the wall
is gonna have my prescription.

43:55.363 --> 43:58.449
It's not a big deal
until you make it a big deal.

43:58.492 --> 44:00.784
Richie, now, I was in a very good mood.

44:00.869 --> 44:04.288
So stop bringing me down
with this bullshit!

44:07.167 --> 44:08.876
I can't wear this shit.

44:08.960 --> 44:11.462
Hey, guys. We're here.

44:46.790 --> 44:48.499
Pussy!

44:54.005 --> 44:57.007
All right, pussy, pussy, pussy!

44:57.050 --> 44:59.468
Come on in, pussy lovers.

44:59.511 --> 45:02.846
Here at the Titty Twister,
we're slashin' pussy in half.

45:02.931 --> 45:07.434
Give us an offer on our best selection
of pussy. This is a pussy blowout!

45:07.519 --> 45:12.106
All right, we got white pussy, black pussy,
Spanish pussy, yellow pussy.

45:12.190 --> 45:14.024
We got hot pussy, cold pussy.

45:14.067 --> 45:17.361
We got wet pussy. We got smelly pussy.

45:17.404 --> 45:21.031
We got hairy pussy, bloody pussy.
We got snappin' pussy.

45:21.074 --> 45:24.285
We got silk pussy, velvet pussy,
naugahyde pussy.

45:24.369 --> 45:27.788
We even got horse pussy,
dog pussy, chicken pussy.

45:27.872 --> 45:30.833
Come on, you want pussy.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

45:30.875 --> 45:34.503
If we don't got it, you don't want it.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

45:41.386 --> 45:44.597
Okay, troops, it's the homestretch.
Here's the deal.

45:44.681 --> 45:49.560
This place closes at dawn. Carlos is gonna
meet us here sometime before dawn.

45:49.644 --> 45:51.895
Now, we are gonna go in there,
we're gonna take a seat,

45:51.980 --> 45:53.856
we're gonna have a drink,
we're gonna have a bunch of drinks.

45:53.898 --> 45:55.983
And we're gonna wait for Carlos.

45:56.067 --> 45:58.819
Let me just say something.
I'm very happy about where we're at.

45:58.903 --> 46:03.490
We got a real nice "I don't fuck with you,
you don't fuck with me" attitude goin' on.

46:03.575 --> 46:07.578
So if everybody just keeps playin' it cool,
I'm talkin' to you, too, Richie,

46:07.621 --> 46:10.414
then everybody's gonna get what they want.

46:12.792 --> 46:16.503
Okay, hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
I'm buyin'. Come on.

46:16.588 --> 46:17.921
Here we go.

46:25.263 --> 46:27.598
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

46:27.682 --> 46:32.353
Attention, pussy shoppers!
Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.

46:32.437 --> 46:35.105
If you buy one piece of pussy
at the regular price,

46:35.190 --> 46:40.110
you will get another piece of pussy of
equal or lesser value for only a penny.

46:40.195 --> 46:42.571
Try and beat pussy for a penny.

46:42.614 --> 46:47.159
If you can find cheaper pussy
anywhere, fuck it!

46:50.580 --> 46:55.918
Hey, what do we have approaching here?
A new flavor, apple pie pussy.

46:57.504 --> 46:59.296
Hey, not so fast, slick.

46:59.381 --> 47:00.506
Step aside, asshole.

47:01.716 --> 47:02.841
Son of a...

47:04.344 --> 47:07.471
Now, is my shit together
or is my shit together?

47:08.932 --> 47:10.307
Here we go.

47:14.229 --> 47:17.481
Hi! How ya doin'? Enjoying it? I hope so!

47:29.160 --> 47:32.496
Now, this is my kind of place.

48:02.235 --> 48:04.278
I could become a regular.

48:19.753 --> 48:21.044
Whiskey!

48:32.891 --> 48:36.226
- You can't come in here.
- What do you mean?

48:36.311 --> 48:39.062
It's a private bar. You're not welcome.

48:39.105 --> 48:42.191
Are you tellin' me that
I'm not good enough to drink here?

48:42.233 --> 48:46.069
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.

48:47.655 --> 48:49.490
You, get out!

48:53.536 --> 48:55.746
- Take your hand off of me.
- I'm gonna count to three.

48:55.830 --> 48:58.457
No, I'm gonna count to three.

48:58.541 --> 48:59.583
- One...
- Two...

48:59.626 --> 49:02.169
Now, wait a minute.
There is no reason to get ugly.

49:02.253 --> 49:05.756
There is just a misunderstanding
going on here.

49:06.925 --> 49:10.260
You said this bar is for truckers and bikers?

49:10.303 --> 49:12.304
Well, I'm a truck driver.

49:12.764 --> 49:14.765
If you look outside your
door in your parking lot,

49:14.808 --> 49:18.101
you'll see a big recreational vehicle.

49:18.186 --> 49:19.436
That's mine.

49:19.521 --> 49:23.774
In order to drive that legally,
you need a class two driver's license.

49:24.776 --> 49:26.902
This bar is for truck drivers?

49:26.945 --> 49:28.821
I am a truck driver.

49:28.905 --> 49:30.781
These are my friends.

49:37.914 --> 49:40.082
Welcome to the Titty Twister.

49:40.124 --> 49:43.126
- Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.
- Coming right up.

50:08.903 --> 50:11.822
- You serve food here, José?
- Best in Mexico.

50:11.906 --> 50:13.657
I kind of doubt that.

50:15.994 --> 50:19.997
We're gonna go over here. You send
a waitress over to take our order. Okay?

51:12.675 --> 51:15.260
Mary had a little lamb

51:16.346 --> 51:19.264
His fleece was black as coal, yeah

51:20.683 --> 51:24.895
Anytime you want a lap dance with
that girl, kid, just let me know, all right?

51:24.938 --> 51:26.313
It's on me.

51:29.567 --> 51:30.776
Pass.

51:31.569 --> 51:33.737
Is it against your religion?

51:33.821 --> 51:37.240
No. I do drink. I'm just not drinkin' now.

51:38.034 --> 51:39.076
Fair enough. More for me.

51:39.160 --> 51:41.078
- Scott, how 'bout you?
- No.

51:41.162 --> 51:45.123
- Kate, how 'bout you?
- No, I can't. I'm not 21 yet.

51:45.917 --> 51:47.459
That means yes.

51:48.044 --> 51:49.670
Post time, Kate!

51:51.756 --> 51:53.006
Here we go. You slam it down.

51:53.091 --> 51:55.217
You knock the glass down
on the table, all right?

51:55.259 --> 51:56.885
One, two, three!

52:02.809 --> 52:04.685
Attagirl, Kate.

52:04.769 --> 52:06.812
Scotty, are you ready? Here we go.
You ready for one?

52:06.896 --> 52:07.938
Okay.

52:08.022 --> 52:09.231
- No, he won't.
- Yes, he will.

52:09.273 --> 52:12.275
Yes, he will, because
I'm not drinking by myself.

52:12.944 --> 52:14.569
Kate, round two.
You ready? Here we go.

52:14.612 --> 52:16.780
Yes, I'll have another one. Thank you.

52:17.115 --> 52:18.573
On three. One, two, three.

52:30.461 --> 52:32.170
Why are you so agitated?

52:32.588 --> 52:35.674
I'm still stewing about that ape
laying his hand on me.

52:36.300 --> 52:37.634
What are you gonna do?

52:37.719 --> 52:39.469
I'm gonna sit here and
I'm gonna finish with this bottle.

52:39.721 --> 52:41.013
And when I'm finished,

52:41.097 --> 52:43.098
I'm gonna take this bottle
and I'm gonna bust it

52:43.141 --> 52:44.891
over his melon fucking head!

52:46.144 --> 52:49.104
Before we stepped in here,
you told all of us to be cool.

52:49.939 --> 52:51.148
So, that means you, too.

52:51.232 --> 52:53.233
I never said do what I do.
I said do what I say.

52:56.029 --> 52:58.280
On my way I passed it

52:59.907 --> 53:01.283
Express yourself

53:14.881 --> 53:19.176
Are you such a fucking loser,
you can't tell when you've won?

53:19.510 --> 53:21.762
- What'd you call me?
- Nothing.

53:21.971 --> 53:25.182
I didn't make a statement.
I asked a question.

53:25.516 --> 53:27.893
- Would you like me to ask it again?
- Mmm-hmm.

53:28.686 --> 53:31.605
Are you such a loser,
you can't tell when you've won?

53:33.733 --> 53:37.694
The entire state of Texas,
along with the FBI,

53:38.488 --> 53:39.738
are looking for you.

53:40.907 --> 53:42.157
Did they find you?

53:43.201 --> 53:44.409
No, they couldn't.

53:45.495 --> 53:46.745
You've won, Seth.

53:48.998 --> 53:50.040
Enjoy it.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.086
Jacob,

53:56.464 --> 53:59.466
I want you to have a drink with me. I insist.

54:04.472 --> 54:05.722
To your family.

54:06.891 --> 54:07.974
To yours.

54:16.734 --> 54:19.152
And now, for your viewing pleasure,

54:19.737 --> 54:21.321
the mistress of the macabre,

54:22.615 --> 54:23.865
the epitome of evil,

54:24.117 --> 54:26.993
the most sinister woman
to ever dance on the face of this Earth.

54:27.370 --> 54:29.746
Bite this!
- Lowly dog!

54:30.581 --> 54:34.376
Bow your head, kneel and worship

54:34.710 --> 54:38.463
at the feet of Santanico Pandemonium.

55:33.352 --> 55:36.980
Watching her

55:37.023 --> 55:39.608
Strolling in the night

55:40.026 --> 55:41.318
So right

55:41.819 --> 55:44.779
Wondering why

55:45.072 --> 55:48.575
It's only after dark

55:57.210 --> 56:00.503
In her eyes

56:00.546 --> 56:03.381
The distant firelight

56:03.758 --> 56:05.300
Burns bright

56:05.635 --> 56:08.637
Wondering why

56:08.971 --> 56:12.307
It's only after dark

56:21.609 --> 56:25.195
Find myself in her room

56:26.405 --> 56:30.575
Feel the fever of my doom

56:31.202 --> 56:34.579
Falling for her through the floor

56:35.706 --> 56:39.125
I'm knocking on the devil's door

56:39.210 --> 56:40.627
Yeah

58:15.806 --> 58:19.392
Burning, burning in the flame

58:20.478 --> 58:24.481
Now that I know her secret name

58:25.358 --> 58:28.610
You can tear her temple down

58:29.820 --> 58:33.323
But she'll be back and rule again

58:33.407 --> 58:34.532
Yeah

58:58.182 --> 58:59.933
That's what I call a fucking show!

59:04.021 --> 59:05.105
Wow!

59:15.408 --> 59:16.449
Come here!

59:18.369 --> 59:19.953
That guy! It's the puta over there!

59:20.037 --> 59:21.329
Richie, get back on the clock.

59:23.999 --> 59:26.126
- How many?
- Three.

59:29.004 --> 59:30.004
Which one?

59:31.257 --> 59:35.593
This piece of shit here, man.
Broke my finger and my nose!

59:36.387 --> 59:39.264
And this faggot kicked me
in the ribs while I was down.

59:39.640 --> 59:42.225
- Up!
- Fuck you, bogeyman!

59:47.773 --> 59:49.065
Fuck!

59:52.027 --> 59:53.319
Fuck you!

01:00:04.248 --> 01:00:07.792
All right, everybody be cool,
or you'll be just as dead as these fucks!

01:00:09.753 --> 01:00:11.754
How's your hand? Let me see it.

01:00:14.508 --> 01:00:15.550
Shit.

01:00:25.102 --> 01:00:26.519
You think that was funny?

01:00:37.531 --> 01:00:38.573
Sit down!

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:04.682
Richie, look out!

01:01:04.934 --> 01:01:07.810
Motherfucking shit! Get the fuck off me!

01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:09.854
- Hey! Hey!
- Get her off me!

01:01:11.482 --> 01:01:13.149
What the fuck are you doing? Shoot her!

01:01:15.528 --> 01:01:16.653
I'm coming, buddy!

01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:24.202
- Richie. Rich.
- You bitch.

01:01:26.038 --> 01:01:27.080
Richie.

01:01:28.916 --> 01:01:30.500
Fucking bitch!

01:01:31.961 --> 01:01:33.002
Richie.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.762
Hey.

01:01:58.654 --> 01:01:59.904
What the fuck?

01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:09.289
Dinner is served.

01:02:17.756 --> 01:02:19.132
What the fuck?

01:02:29.852 --> 01:02:31.394
Get off me!

01:02:47.328 --> 01:02:48.911
Come on! Come on, you!

01:02:50.205 --> 01:02:51.331
Jacob!

01:02:55.419 --> 01:02:57.420
Oh, no! Look out! Look out!

01:03:05.095 --> 01:03:07.347
You know what everybody
says about me, huh?

01:03:08.015 --> 01:03:09.098
I suck!

01:03:39.463 --> 01:03:41.464
Get off me! What the fuck are you doing?

01:03:47.846 --> 01:03:50.640
Let's see if you taste
as good as your brother.

01:03:52.768 --> 01:03:53.768
Fuck you!

01:04:14.123 --> 01:04:15.123
Hey! Hey!

01:04:30.764 --> 01:04:31.764
Oh, shit!

01:04:39.523 --> 01:04:40.565
Huh?

01:04:47.197 --> 01:04:48.239
Gimme that!

01:05:06.133 --> 01:05:08.384
I'm not gonna drain you completely.

01:05:09.303 --> 01:05:10.845
You'll be my slave.

01:05:12.681 --> 01:05:14.724
Because I don't think you're
worthy of human blood,

01:05:14.767 --> 01:05:17.226
you'll feed on the blood of stray dogs.

01:05:18.562 --> 01:05:19.729
You'll be my foot stool.

01:05:20.272 --> 01:05:23.941
And at my command,
you'll lick the dog shit from my boot heel.

01:05:25.819 --> 01:05:27.195
Since you'll be my dog,

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.615
your new name will be Spot.

01:05:32.785 --> 01:05:35.536
Welcome to slavery.

01:05:36.038 --> 01:05:38.039
No, thanks. I already had a wife.

01:06:03.607 --> 01:06:04.941
We might be in trouble.

01:06:11.448 --> 01:06:13.074
Yo, monkey man.

01:06:15.994 --> 01:06:17.620
Anything you got to say to them,

01:06:20.374 --> 01:06:21.457
say to me first.

01:06:24.294 --> 01:06:25.711
This!

01:06:46.191 --> 01:06:47.316
That's enough.

01:08:15.781 --> 01:08:17.323
Ain't they supposed to
burn up or something?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.960
Oh, fuck.

01:08:40.721 --> 01:08:42.598
Now let's kill that fucking band!

01:08:43.642 --> 01:08:44.767
I can do that.

01:08:47.562 --> 01:08:49.522
Fuck you, everybody. Good night!

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:55.069
Fuckers.

01:09:12.962 --> 01:09:13.962
Hey, buddy.

01:09:16.758 --> 01:09:19.093
I'm sorry I fucked things up, Richie.

01:09:25.642 --> 01:09:28.060
You would've liked it in El Rey.
You would've...

01:09:30.104 --> 01:09:31.313
You would've found peace.

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:36.484
I love you, buddy.

01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:40.656
I love you too, Seth.

01:09:54.463 --> 01:09:56.630
You touch my brother with that stake, biker,

01:09:56.673 --> 01:09:58.257
and vampires aren't gonna
have to suck your blood.

01:09:58.341 --> 01:09:59.842
They'll be able to lick it up off the floor.

01:09:59.885 --> 01:10:01.052
He's not your brother anymore.

01:10:01.136 --> 01:10:04.388
That's a matter of opinion
and I don't give a fuck about yours.

01:10:04.514 --> 01:10:08.350
Don't be a fool! He'll kill us all.

01:10:08.393 --> 01:10:10.186
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:12.563
Let's go. Move, move.

01:10:29.706 --> 01:10:30.790
Hold him down.

01:10:37.172 --> 01:10:38.339
Richie.

01:10:39.633 --> 01:10:43.636
Here is the peace in death,
that I could not give you in life.

01:10:59.945 --> 01:11:01.070
Fuck!

01:11:12.082 --> 01:11:14.917
Seth, are you okay?

01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:17.753
I'm peachy, Kate. The worid is my oyster.

01:11:22.259 --> 01:11:24.009
Except for the fact
that I just...

01:11:25.971 --> 01:11:29.598
I just rammed a wooden stake
into my brother's chest,

01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:31.684
because he turned into a vampire.

01:11:32.269 --> 01:11:34.311
Even though I don't believe in vampires.

01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:37.857
Aside from that unfortunate business,

01:11:38.942 --> 01:11:40.401
everything is hunky-dory.

01:11:43.822 --> 01:11:46.740
- I'm really, really sorry.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

01:11:48.618 --> 01:11:51.078
If it were up to you,
if you had half a chance,

01:11:51.288 --> 01:11:53.038
you would feed us to those fucks.

01:11:53.206 --> 01:11:54.415
Then why didn't I?

01:11:58.753 --> 01:12:01.714
I'm sorry you lost your brother.
I'm sorry he's dead.

01:12:02.132 --> 01:12:03.966
I'm sorry everybody's dead.

01:12:04.384 --> 01:12:08.637
But if we're gonna get out of this,
we need you clean and sober and thinking.

01:12:08.722 --> 01:12:09.805
Not drunk.

01:12:13.977 --> 01:12:15.144
What is that?

01:12:15.395 --> 01:12:19.440
Don't know. First I thought it was just birds.

01:12:23.028 --> 01:12:24.069
Bats.

01:12:30.952 --> 01:12:31.994
Gimme a hand.

01:13:20.335 --> 01:13:21.377
No!

01:13:24.256 --> 01:13:25.339
Hey!

01:13:41.106 --> 01:13:42.606
I'm sorry.

01:13:43.733 --> 01:13:44.817
Come on!

01:13:54.786 --> 01:13:58.747
We'll take care of this mess,
you go stake the rest of those ugly fucks.

01:13:58.915 --> 01:13:59.957
Way ahead of you.

01:14:01.543 --> 01:14:04.420
- Watch your step. What's your name, girlie?
- Kate. What's yours?

01:14:04.462 --> 01:14:06.588
- Sex Machine. Pleased to meet you, Kate.
- You, too.

01:15:31.674 --> 01:15:34.843
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

01:15:40.183 --> 01:15:42.226
Does anybody know
what's going on here?

01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:43.519
I know what's going on.

01:15:44.062 --> 01:15:45.938
We've got a bunch
of fucking vampires out there,

01:15:46.022 --> 01:15:48.690
trying to get in here
and suck our fucking blood,

01:15:48.775 --> 01:15:50.401
and that's it, plain and simple.

01:15:50.485 --> 01:15:53.320
And I don't wanna hear anything about
"I don't believe in vampires."

01:15:53.363 --> 01:15:58.117
Because I don't fucking believe in vampires,
but I believe in my own two eyes,

01:15:58.326 --> 01:16:00.953
and what I saw is fucking vampires.

01:16:01.037 --> 01:16:04.748
Now, do we all agree that what
we are dealing with is vampires?

01:16:05.375 --> 01:16:07.668
Yes.
- You, too, preacher?

01:16:08.378 --> 01:16:11.713
I don't believe in vampires,
but I believe in what I saw.

01:16:11.798 --> 01:16:14.925
Good for you. All right, now that we all
agree that we're dealing with vampires,

01:16:15.009 --> 01:16:16.552
what do we know about vampires?

01:16:17.262 --> 01:16:19.430
Crosses hurt vampires. Do we have a cross?

01:16:20.056 --> 01:16:21.348
In the motor home.

01:16:21.391 --> 01:16:22.433
In other words, no.

01:16:22.517 --> 01:16:25.769
Wait a second. I mean, just look around.
We got crosses all over the place.

01:16:25.854 --> 01:16:28.689
All you gotta do is put two sticks together
and you got a cross.

01:16:28.731 --> 01:16:31.233
Yeah, he's right.
Peter Cushing does that all the time.

01:16:31.317 --> 01:16:34.528
Okay, I'll buy that.
So, we got crosses covered. What else?

01:16:34.737 --> 01:16:37.364
Wooden stakes in the heart
have been working pretty good so far.

01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:42.744
And garlic, sunlight, holy water. I'm not sure.

01:16:42.871 --> 01:16:44.913
Doesn't silver have
something to do with vampires?

01:16:44.998 --> 01:16:46.248
That's werewolves.

01:16:46.332 --> 01:16:47.791
I know silver bullets are werewolves.

01:16:47.876 --> 01:16:50.169
But I'm sure silver has
something to do with vampires.

01:16:50.253 --> 01:16:52.296
Well, does anybody have any silver?

01:16:55.258 --> 01:16:56.925
Okay. Then, who cares?

01:16:58.261 --> 01:17:00.846
Has anybody here read
a real book about vampires,

01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:03.307
or are we just remembering
what some movie said?

01:17:03.808 --> 01:17:06.810
I mean, a real book.
- You mean like a Time-Life book?

01:17:06.936 --> 01:17:09.730
I take it the answer's no. Okay, then.

01:17:09.772 --> 01:17:12.024
What do we know about these vampires?

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:15.694
We know they got superhuman strength,
but we can hurt them.

01:17:15.778 --> 01:17:17.362
- Yeah.
Another thing, though is

01:17:17.447 --> 01:17:19.448
if you're gonna drive
a chair leg through a human,

01:17:19.782 --> 01:17:21.783
you better be one strong son of a bitch.

01:17:21.868 --> 01:17:25.537
I mean, the human body is
one rough, tough machine.

01:17:25.788 --> 01:17:29.124
But these vamps, these vamps,
they have soft bodies.

01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:32.503
The texture of their skin is soft
and they're mushier.

01:17:32.587 --> 01:17:34.046
You can push shit right through them.

01:17:34.255 --> 01:17:37.466
Conceivably, if you hit one hard enough,
take their head right off.

01:17:40.345 --> 01:17:44.515
Actually, our best weapon
against these satanic cocksuckers,

01:17:45.308 --> 01:17:46.308
is this man.

01:17:47.936 --> 01:17:49.144
He's a preacher.

01:17:49.896 --> 01:17:52.439
As far as God's concerned,
we might as well all be a piece of shit,

01:17:52.482 --> 01:17:53.982
but he's one of the boys.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.361
Only one problem,
his faith isn't what it used to be.

01:18:02.242 --> 01:18:03.951
I've had enough of your taunts.

01:18:05.578 --> 01:18:08.956
I'm not taunting you, Jacob. We need you.

01:18:10.124 --> 01:18:13.752
A faithless preacher doesn't mean shit to us.

01:18:17.382 --> 01:18:22.302
A servant of God can take a cross
and shove it up these monsters' asses.

01:18:22.345 --> 01:18:26.932
A servant of God can bless the tap water
and make it a weapon.

01:18:29.686 --> 01:18:30.811
Jacob,

01:18:31.896 --> 01:18:33.564
I know why you lost your faith.

01:18:36.526 --> 01:18:41.863
How could holiness exist if your wife can be
taken away from you and your children?

01:18:43.783 --> 01:18:46.535
Now, I've always said
that God can kiss my ass.

01:18:46.578 --> 01:18:49.955
But I just changed
my lifetime tune about 30 minutes ago.

01:18:50.373 --> 01:18:54.001
'Cause I know that whatever is out there
trying to get in,

01:18:54.043 --> 01:18:56.336
is pure evil, straight from hell.

01:18:56.379 --> 01:19:00.007
And if there is a hell,
and those sons of bitches are from it,

01:19:00.049 --> 01:19:03.051
then there has got to be a heaven, Jacob.
There's gotta be!

01:19:08.182 --> 01:19:09.391
So, which are you?

01:19:11.227 --> 01:19:13.103
Are you a faithless preacher,

01:19:13.187 --> 01:19:15.856
or are you a mean
motherfucking servant of God?

01:19:25.992 --> 01:19:27.576
I'm a mean

01:19:30.496 --> 01:19:32.205
servant of God.

01:19:39.464 --> 01:19:42.257
I don't know if I can take
much more of that noise.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.177
Sure you can.

01:19:47.305 --> 01:19:49.931
You can take it because you got no choice.

01:19:51.392 --> 01:19:55.604
How'd you like to spend 24 hours
of it lying in some muddy ditch,

01:19:56.189 --> 01:20:00.233
with nothing but the rotten corpses
of your friends to keep you company?

01:20:01.027 --> 01:20:02.653
What are you talking about?

01:20:07.617 --> 01:20:09.076
I was in 'Nam.

01:20:09.952 --> 01:20:11.244
Back in '72.

01:20:13.289 --> 01:20:15.457
I was trapped behind enemy lines,

01:20:16.167 --> 01:20:18.251
with my entire squad dead.

01:20:20.129 --> 01:20:21.838
They thought they had killed everyone.

01:20:23.549 --> 01:20:26.134
Except for me, they was right.

01:20:26.803 --> 01:20:28.970
But it wasn't for their lack of trying.

01:20:29.806 --> 01:20:31.056
A grenade,

01:20:32.016 --> 01:20:34.267
blew up right beside me.

01:20:36.479 --> 01:20:37.938
That's why I'm so pretty.

01:20:39.148 --> 01:20:42.734
And they start pushing
all them bodies in on top of me.

01:20:43.152 --> 01:20:45.320
And all I could do, was lay there.

01:20:45.613 --> 01:20:46.822
Play possum.

01:20:47.782 --> 01:20:50.325
Listen to the enemy joke, laugh,

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:54.371
hour after hour after hour.

01:21:04.382 --> 01:21:06.967
Sex Machine.

01:21:07.009 --> 01:21:09.386
Kill them.

01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:11.388
Kill them.

01:21:13.558 --> 01:21:15.434
So I finally climbed out of this hole

01:21:16.853 --> 01:21:19.396
and I sneaked up on the enemy
while he was sleeping.

01:21:20.273 --> 01:21:24.609
And I killed one, two, three, four, five...

01:21:56.058 --> 01:21:57.851
When I came to my senses,

01:21:59.729 --> 01:22:04.191
I realized I had killed an entire VC squad.

01:22:04.817 --> 01:22:05.984
Single-handed.

01:22:06.736 --> 01:22:09.488
There was blood

01:22:10.615 --> 01:22:15.243
and chunks of yellow flesh,
clinging to my bayonet.

01:22:20.416 --> 01:22:24.044
To this day, I don't remember...

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.423
Get him off of me! Get off of me!

01:22:28.466 --> 01:22:30.675
Please! Get him off!

01:22:35.306 --> 01:22:36.473
No!

01:22:44.148 --> 01:22:45.190
Dad!

01:22:59.455 --> 01:23:02.749
He fucking bit me. He fucking bit me.

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:05.877
What are you gonna do about it?

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:08.129
Come on, Sex Machine.

01:23:19.183 --> 01:23:22.143
Oh, shit!

01:23:32.655 --> 01:23:35.240
Get up! Get up! Up! Come on!

01:23:46.878 --> 01:23:49.296
Go! Fuck!

01:23:59.807 --> 01:24:02.809
Wait, we have to go back for my father.

01:24:02.852 --> 01:24:04.603
Your dad's dead, Kate.

01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:51.942
He is the light.

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:56.154
The people who walk

01:24:57.073 --> 01:24:58.573
in the darkness

01:25:00.451 --> 01:25:02.827
have seen the light!

01:25:27.603 --> 01:25:29.270
Open the door!

01:25:30.856 --> 01:25:32.232
Open the door!

01:25:36.028 --> 01:25:37.195
Go! Go!

01:25:37.571 --> 01:25:38.822
Oh, Daddy!

01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:40.949
Jacob, are you bit?

01:25:43.285 --> 01:25:44.369
Yeah.

01:25:45.121 --> 01:25:48.581
Motherfuck. Motherfucking vampires!

01:25:48.624 --> 01:25:52.794
I'm gonna kill every last one of
you godless, fucking pieces of shit!

01:25:52.837 --> 01:25:54.671
You bet you are
and I'm gonna help you do it.

01:25:55.464 --> 01:25:57.090
But we ain't got much time.

01:25:57.383 --> 01:26:00.468
- You're gonna be okay, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.722
I've been bit.
In fact, I'm already dead.

01:26:04.849 --> 01:26:06.057
Now...

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.979
I'd say in the next 20 or 30 minutes,
our friends outside will bust in this door

01:26:11.147 --> 01:26:14.315
and I'll probably turn into a vampire
within the hour.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.859
Now, you have two choices.

01:26:15.943 --> 01:26:18.987
You can wait for me to turn,
then deal with me.

01:26:19.321 --> 01:26:21.239
Or we can kick open that door,

01:26:21.657 --> 01:26:25.410
and the four of us can go at 'em,
hit 'em with everything we have.

01:26:26.037 --> 01:26:28.204
But if we're gonna go at 'em,
we gotta go at 'em now.

01:26:31.625 --> 01:26:32.834
What's this stuff?

01:26:34.045 --> 01:26:36.254
My guess is this little dive

01:26:36.338 --> 01:26:39.591
has been feeding on bikers
and truckers for a long time.

01:26:40.342 --> 01:26:42.469
This is probably the shipments
they stole off the trucks.

01:26:42.511 --> 01:26:44.763
I say, let's tear this place apart for weapons.

01:26:44.847 --> 01:26:47.057
So when they burst through that door,
we'll make 'em wish they never did.

01:26:47.141 --> 01:26:48.349
I don't care about living or dying anymore.

01:26:48.434 --> 01:26:51.561
I just wanna send as many of
these devils back to hell, as I can.

01:26:51.854 --> 01:26:52.937
Amen.

01:27:56.252 --> 01:27:58.294
Loving God, bless this water

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:02.507
and give us your protection and strength
in this, our darkest hour. Amen.

01:28:11.267 --> 01:28:14.644
Before we go any further,
I need you three to promise me something.

01:28:15.396 --> 01:28:18.439
I'll fight with you till the bitter end,
but when I turn into one of them,

01:28:19.233 --> 01:28:20.984
I won't be Jacob anymore.

01:28:22.278 --> 01:28:24.028
I'll be a lapdog of Satan.

01:28:24.947 --> 01:28:28.575
I want you three to promise you'll
take me down, no different from the rest.

01:28:29.326 --> 01:28:30.493
I promise, Jacob.

01:28:31.537 --> 01:28:33.079
Kate? Scott?

01:28:34.498 --> 01:28:35.623
I promise.

01:28:36.834 --> 01:28:39.169
- Scott?
- Yeah, I promise.

01:28:42.464 --> 01:28:44.048
Why don't I believe you?

01:28:47.136 --> 01:28:48.636
I'm gonna ask you two again.

01:28:49.847 --> 01:28:52.182
Then I want you to swear to God,

01:28:52.558 --> 01:28:54.225
that you'll kill me!

01:28:55.519 --> 01:28:59.480
If you don't,
I'm gonna just kill myself right now.

01:28:59.815 --> 01:29:03.109
Now, since you need me,
I think you better swear!

01:29:04.153 --> 01:29:09.991
Kate, do you swear to God
that when I become one of the undead,

01:29:10.743 --> 01:29:11.993
you'll kill me?

01:29:14.371 --> 01:29:15.496
Kate!

01:29:15.998 --> 01:29:18.625
We don't have much time,
so I'm only giving you to the count of five.

01:29:18.667 --> 01:29:22.795
One, two, three, four...

01:29:22.838 --> 01:29:25.673
Okay, all right! I promise I'll do it!

01:29:27.551 --> 01:29:29.677
Good girl. Now, Scott,

01:29:30.262 --> 01:29:32.889
we have even less time,
so I'm giving you the count of three.

01:29:32.973 --> 01:29:35.350
- One...
- No, you don't believe in suicide.

01:29:35.392 --> 01:29:39.437
It's not suicide, if you're already dead. Two.

01:29:39.855 --> 01:29:42.232
Okay! Okay.

01:29:43.192 --> 01:29:46.694
I'll kill you when you change.
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.

01:29:46.779 --> 01:29:47.779
Thank you, Son.

01:29:48.197 --> 01:29:52.575
Okay, vampire killers,
let's kill some fucking vampires.

01:30:13.389 --> 01:30:17.100
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

01:30:17.184 --> 01:30:19.894
In the darkness have seen the light.

01:30:21.563 --> 01:30:23.940
In the darkness, the light.

01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:46.212
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

01:30:48.966 --> 01:30:50.508
Kill 'em all!

01:32:17.638 --> 01:32:19.514
Come on! Come on!

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.800
Dad?

01:34:30.687 --> 01:34:32.396
Dad! No, Dad!

01:34:32.606 --> 01:34:34.148
Dad! Dad!

01:34:47.162 --> 01:34:49.372
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.

01:34:51.333 --> 01:34:52.667
Oh, my God!

01:34:54.169 --> 01:34:55.711
Fight now, cry later!

01:35:00.968 --> 01:35:05.304
Get the fuck off! Get off! Get off! Get 'em off!

01:35:19.611 --> 01:35:20.861
Kill me, Kate.

01:35:23.407 --> 01:35:25.032
Just kill me, Kate.

01:35:26.868 --> 01:35:28.035
I can't.

01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:50.558
- How many bullets you have?
- I don't know. Not many.

01:35:51.184 --> 01:35:53.894
When you run out, start cold-cocking 'em.
Make 'em sing for their supper.

01:36:05.157 --> 01:36:08.326
Seth, should I save the last bullets for us?

01:36:08.952 --> 01:36:11.662
No. Use it on the next fuck
that tries to bite you.

01:36:22.007 --> 01:36:24.300
Shoot more holes. Shoot more holes!

01:36:31.183 --> 01:36:33.100
- Perfect.
- They can't go into the light.

01:36:33.477 --> 01:36:36.687
Perfect. All right, go.

01:36:36.772 --> 01:36:38.606
Hey, Seth, don't leave me.

01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:43.778
Come here. Come here. Come on!

01:36:45.447 --> 01:36:46.447
Come on, you!

01:36:49.618 --> 01:36:50.785
Come here, you fucks!

01:36:52.788 --> 01:36:55.456
Hello?
I'm looking for my friend Seth.

01:36:55.957 --> 01:36:58.793
Carlos! Kick in the door!

01:37:09.262 --> 01:37:10.304
Go!

01:37:11.264 --> 01:37:12.682
Son of a bitch.

01:37:43.255 --> 01:37:45.005
What the fuck was goin' on in there?

01:37:50.637 --> 01:37:52.263
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?

01:37:52.347 --> 01:37:57.685
Why, out of all the godforsaken shit holes
in Mexico do we have to meet here?

01:37:59.354 --> 01:38:01.355
One place is just as good as another.

01:38:03.525 --> 01:38:04.734
You ever been here before?

01:38:06.737 --> 01:38:09.822
No. I drove by it a couple times.

01:38:10.198 --> 01:38:12.450
It's a rowdy place.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

01:38:12.534 --> 01:38:14.827
There'll be no cops.
And it's open from dusk till dawn.

01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:17.204
Didn't you say you wanted to
meet in the morning? Here we are.

01:38:17.247 --> 01:38:20.750
Well, since you just picked this
place out of a hat, my brother is dead,

01:38:20.834 --> 01:38:24.211
that girl's entire fucking family is dead!

01:38:27.758 --> 01:38:28.883
What were they? Psychos?

01:38:29.718 --> 01:38:31.635
They look like psychos?
Is that what they looked like?

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:32.720
They were vampires.

01:38:32.804 --> 01:38:36.056
Psychos do not explode
when sunlight hits them.

01:38:36.099 --> 01:38:37.892
I don't give a fuck how crazy they are!

01:38:40.437 --> 01:38:43.230
Seth, how can I make it up to you?

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:46.776
You can't make it up to me, Carlos.
You can't do it.

01:38:47.110 --> 01:38:48.736
Can't make it up!

01:38:52.699 --> 01:38:57.244
15% instead of 30% for my stay
in El Rey, that's a good start.

01:38:59.915 --> 01:39:00.956
Twenty-eight.

01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:03.501
My brother's gone.
You understand that?

01:39:03.585 --> 01:39:06.587
He's gone and he's not coming back
and that is your fault.

01:39:10.217 --> 01:39:11.342
Twenty.

01:39:14.346 --> 01:39:15.513
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five.

01:39:17.891 --> 01:39:20.351
Kate. Go to the RV, get the suitcase.

01:39:26.316 --> 01:39:27.608
You look like hell.

01:39:29.444 --> 01:39:31.779
You want a cold beer?
I got some in the car.

01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:35.783
Come on, they're cold. Huh?

01:39:36.409 --> 01:39:37.952
I got Mexican and domestic.

01:39:55.971 --> 01:39:58.180
So, how do you like the car?
It's all right.

01:40:00.016 --> 01:40:02.768
I said "like new." This is a '90.

01:40:03.103 --> 01:40:07.064
Hey, it is new, cabrón.
Belonged to a drug dealer friend of mine.

01:40:07.232 --> 01:40:09.650
Hey, he only drove it,
like, 14 times in five years.

01:40:09.693 --> 01:40:11.026
It's like new, I swear to God.

01:40:15.031 --> 01:40:17.783
- So, what do I do, follow you?
- Yeah, follow me.

01:40:17.826 --> 01:40:18.868
All right, let's do it.

01:40:28.003 --> 01:40:29.003
I'm sorry.

01:40:41.808 --> 01:40:43.309
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:54.403
- I'll see ya.
- Seth?

01:40:57.866 --> 01:40:59.450
You need some company?

01:41:03.288 --> 01:41:05.748
Kate, do you know where I'm going?
Do you know what El Rey is?

01:41:08.418 --> 01:41:10.336
- No.
Hey, Seth.

01:41:12.297 --> 01:41:13.714
It's time to go.

01:41:16.259 --> 01:41:17.551
Go home, Kate.

01:41:21.389 --> 01:41:23.849
I may be a bastard,
but I'm not a fucking bastard.

01:41:58.718 --> 01:42:01.470
Hot air hangs like a dead man

01:42:02.806 --> 01:42:04.890
From a white oak tree

01:42:06.643 --> 01:42:09.561
People sittin' on porches

01:42:09.938 --> 01:42:12.189
Thinking how things used to be

01:42:12.732 --> 01:42:14.191
Dark night

01:42:15.944 --> 01:42:18.070
It's a dark night

01:42:19.864 --> 01:42:21.615
Dark night

01:42:23.243 --> 01:42:25.119
It's a dark night

01:43:02.699 --> 01:43:05.701
Everything about her was natural

01:43:06.494 --> 01:43:08.996
Everything about her was cool

01:43:10.290 --> 01:43:13.709
But I'm a little partial for beautiful giris

01:43:14.210 --> 01:43:18.213
Even if their bloods run blue

01:43:20.508 --> 01:43:22.134
I think I see her

01:43:24.179 --> 01:43:26.346
I think I want her

01:43:28.141 --> 01:43:29.892
I think I love her

01:43:29.976 --> 01:43:32.394
She's just killing me

01:43:33.438 --> 01:43:36.023
I think she's killing me

01:43:45.366 --> 01:43:48.243
Her castanets are enormous

01:43:49.079 --> 01:43:51.705
Her bongo beat absolute

01:43:52.874 --> 01:43:56.251
And when she doin' midnight performances

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:59.421
She's got a secret something to boot

01:44:03.051 --> 01:44:04.718
I think I see her

01:44:07.013 --> 01:44:08.430
I think I want her

01:44:10.475 --> 01:44:12.226
Oh, I think I love her

01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:16.063
But she's just killing me, killing me

01:44:16.147 --> 01:44:18.148
I think she's killing me

01:45:21.004 --> 01:45:22.713
Oooh

01:45:33.308 --> 01:45:36.935
Miss Santanico Pandemonium

01:45:37.812 --> 01:45:40.480
Don't get any lower or slower

01:45:41.274 --> 01:45:44.818
What you see is what you get conmigo

01:45:45.153 --> 01:45:48.071
And the bonus of an albino boa

01:45:51.868 --> 01:45:53.410
I think I see her

01:45:55.288 --> 01:45:57.206
I think I want her

01:45:58.917 --> 01:46:00.876
Yes, I think I love her

01:46:01.252 --> 01:46:05.005
She's just killing me, killing me

01:46:05.048 --> 01:46:08.300
She's just killing me
That's some time I had

01:46:10.178 --> 01:46:12.804
Oh, I think I see her

01:46:14.891 --> 01:46:16.767
I know I love her

01:46:18.311 --> 01:46:20.479
Yes, I might love her

01:46:20.521 --> 01:46:24.066
She's just killing me

01:46:24.150 --> 01:46:26.526
She wanna be killing me

01:46:26.569 --> 01:46:28.028
Suck my blood

01:46:29.305 --> 01:46:35.433
