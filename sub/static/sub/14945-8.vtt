Elena's body.

00:06.007 --> 00:09.295
I have some very good
skills for a guy
in your line of work.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.967
Do you think we could
start working on those

You know, I'd be
a lot more worried
about your situation.

You two brainiacs rented

in commission of a crime.

lifted from the morgue?

No?

on a casket that was
dug up recently.

you know,
it's a major felony,

back to prison for some
very serious time.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.163

a lawyer or something?

04:22.012 --> 04:24.389
Yeah, ifwe were cops
you should probably talk
to a lawyer, yeah.

But he's a loose cannon,
and the woman in the coffin
was a friend of mine.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.017
That means
she's taking it
very personally.

That was just
me warming up.

ricocheted out

it's possible.

and this whole mess
with Julian and my mom...

forgave you?

Yeah, she's been weird
ever since the trial.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.727

I turned her testimony
into perjury.

makes me wonder.
What?

easily on the stand,

about other things.

in that fire.

Maybe my mom lied
and he's been alive
this whole time.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.249

off the bean,

to gather the proof.

Hair, saliva...

13:06.787 --> 13:07.776
Yeah.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.205
Do it. Find out.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.291
It'll give you
some peace.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.462
Didn't you just
give him a piece?
You are so out of line!

13:18.548 --> 13:20.209
You're so right, and
you're justjealous.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.961
Honestly, I don't know
what you see in the guy.
(WHIPPING)

13:22.052 --> 13:23.917
He's got many talents.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.673
Well, you've lead
a very sheltered life.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.220
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

13:28.308 --> 13:30.469
Alec Sadler's phone,
how may I direct your call?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.642
Hi, it's Kiera...
Is he there?

13:32.729 --> 13:34.105
Oh, hello, Kieral

13:34.398 --> 13:36.764
Yes, let me see
if he's available.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.359
One moment, please.

13:38.902 --> 13:39.891
Hey, Kiera, what's up?

13:39.987 --> 13:41.147
Is she in the lab?

13:41.238 --> 13:43.524
No, we're at my place,
if you must know.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.822
I'm in his pants,
not in his lab!

13:45.909 --> 13:48.651
You need to protect
yourself, and everything
that you're doing.

13:48.912 --> 13:52.120
How long has Kiera the
cop been the bane of
his existence, anyhow?

13:52.207 --> 13:53.788
She showed up
when he did.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.082
You and Kellog should
start a band, you're
singing the same song.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.455
I hate to agree
with Kellog, but...
Then don’t.

13:58.714 --> 14:01.922
Kellog doesn't know
what he's talking about,
with my work or with Emily.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.507
If he's pressuring
you on something,

14:04.594 --> 14:05.879
don't blindly comply.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.632
Kellog wants what’s
best for Kellog.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.338
And how is that
different from you?
You’re right.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.219
I do have an agenda.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.429
But Alec,
I'm here for you.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.431
Right. Which currently
translates as...

14:15.522 --> 14:17.934
Mystery men,
the body snatchers?

14:22.612 --> 14:25.399
Yeah, I think I can work
with the sound from when
we zombie-hacked Elena,

14:25.490 --> 14:28.607
you know, build up
a sonographic portrait,
an ultrasound of the location.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.403
That sounds great!
Hear how I did that?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.033
Goodbye, Kiera.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.540
Hey, making bail doesn't
mean you're out of the woods.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.007
Hey! That's the one that
violated my civil rights,
right there!

14:43.091 --> 14:45.548
Don't make a scene.
That's good advice.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.047
Come on, no body's been
recovered, this case is
getting tossed.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.844
GARDINER:
Oh, is that a fact?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.303
My clients were walking
through a cemetery...
You guys okay?

14:54.436 --> 14:56.097
There's no criminality
in that!
Oh, shit!

15:01.443 --> 15:02.432
Whoa!

15:07.657 --> 15:09.739
Get some uniforms
in here right now.

15:16.625 --> 15:17.660
Somebody call
an ambulance!

15:18.585 --> 15:20.917
Stay back!
Stay back!
Pl Cameron!

15:34.518 --> 15:37.180
l have never seen anything
like this before.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.602
Okay, then speculate.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.190
There are no
puncture wounds.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.310
CLAYTON: There's
no wounds of any kind.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.141
I need to do an
autopsy to determine

15:45.237 --> 15:47.979
whether poison was involved,
but the visible trauma

15:48.073 --> 15:49.904
suggests an aneurysm.

15:49.991 --> 15:50.980
Aneurysms.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.695
Or maybe not.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.494
Both at the same time.
Right before testifying.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.624
Could be extreme
low frequency.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.876
A concealed, weaponized
ELF disruptor?

16:07.968 --> 16:09.754
No, I don't think so.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.169
What, too
sci-fi for you?

16:12.848 --> 16:14.384
I can think of something
more sci-fi than that.

16:17.269 --> 16:18.725
KIERA: There. Camera three.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.311
See that guy right there?
Can you back it up?

16:23.859 --> 16:26.350
Freeze. There. Zoom in.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.733
Wait, wait, wait.
That's him!

16:31.408 --> 16:33.615
That's the guy
from the morgue.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.496
(MUMBLING)

16:40.584 --> 16:42.996
I'll show you what
I've done so far!

16:43.086 --> 16:45.623
It's actually an idea
of my father's.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.754
You know,
I've never really...

16:52.345 --> 16:55.257
I wanna work on
the time travel,
I mean that's what I know...

16:55.348 --> 16:56.724
Yeah, sure.

16:57.392 --> 17:00.259
That's how you got back
here, same explosion that
brought back the others,

17:00.353 --> 17:02.765
exceptyoulanded
in 1992 which is

17:03.273 --> 17:04.763
two years before
I was born...

17:04.858 --> 17:06.018
Mmm.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.642
Do you remember
anything from then?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.899
Just after you arrived?
People you may have met?

17:11.990 --> 17:14.276
No...
Well, I told you before...

17:15.911 --> 17:19.199
There was a lot of
confusion...
A lot of gaps...

17:22.667 --> 17:25.204
You really like this work?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.745
Yeah, it has potential.

17:28.924 --> 17:29.913
Yeah?

17:44.648 --> 17:47.230
Kiera, I can assure you,
he doesn't work for me.

17:47.317 --> 17:51.185
Now, I'm sure you've got
the tech that'll tell you
exactly where I stand on this.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.235
And I'm sure you know
something about this man,

17:53.323 --> 17:54.403
or who he works for.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.737
Unfortunately, I can't
help you with specifics.

17:58.828 --> 18:02.070
But you're quite right,
he and his associates
are dangerous.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.496
Both to you, and to me.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.914
Because you're
a time traveler.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.121
Time traveler?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.713
You have no personal
items in this office.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.299
No diplomas in frames,

18:15.387 --> 18:16.752
no golf trophies,

18:16.846 --> 18:18.507
no family photos.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.968
I've never been nostalgic.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.845
I suppose it comes
with the territory.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.135
Are you here to analyze me?

18:27.274 --> 18:29.560
You reached out
to me, remember?

18:30.527 --> 18:32.734
Said we had a
common interest?

18:33.989 --> 18:35.525
I guess that was
an empty gesture.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.527
They have tattoos.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.367
On their hands, it's...

18:41.454 --> 18:42.864
It's subtle.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.287
It's a series of dots
between their fingers.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.832
Does that help?
Who are "they"?

18:52.799 --> 18:56.462
You call them freelancers,
but they have no
formal identity.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.293
That would imply
they exist.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.629
They're more of a cult,
and the time continuum

19:00.724 --> 19:03.431
is their chess board,
and people like us
are a liability

19:03.518 --> 19:05.474
because we understand
what's at stake.

19:06.229 --> 19:07.730
What do they want?
What everyone wants.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.316
Power. Control.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.688
I don't want that.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.103
Are you sure?

19:32.339 --> 19:36.924
After your call I checked
our files for anyone
with the marks you described,

19:37.385 --> 19:39.421
and I missed
this John Doe.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.263
To be fair, the broken neck
got most of my attention.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.008
What's his story?
Found in an
east side dumpster,

19:47.103 --> 19:49.059
broken arm,
broken neck,
bruising...

19:49.147 --> 19:51.058
He was in the
fight of his life.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.889
Lost.
No ID?

19:52.984 --> 19:54.724
No grieving relative,
girlfriend...

19:54.819 --> 19:55.934
No, not to date.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.896
I mean, you can understand
how they'd be missed.

19:59.282 --> 20:01.989
Seemingly random,
look like birthmarks.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.066
Freckles, maybe.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.156
They were supposed
to be missed.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.204
They look like tattoos.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.535
Better than that.

20:10.627 --> 20:11.992
(CLEARING THROAT)

20:12.087 --> 20:13.918
I put them under
a microscope,

20:14.339 --> 20:17.331
check this out,
you're not going
to believe it.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.886
Some kind of code.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.150
Okay, this tattoo pattern
has shown up before.

20:38.655 --> 20:42.864
Last November, Emery Wallace,
83 years old, dies in a
retirement home.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.316
Insurance company
requires an autopsy,

20:45.412 --> 20:47.403
they note the pattern
on his right hand.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.488
Same three fingers.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.789
10 years ago,
Tommy Oliver,

20:51.876 --> 20:53.491
apparent suicide,

20:54.003 --> 20:55.789
same markings.
Hmm...

20:57.424 --> 21:00.382
Any other connections?
Well, not at first glance,

21:00.468 --> 21:03.005
but Oliver and Wallace aren't
exactly who they seemed.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.799
You see, they both
died. Twice.

21:06.057 --> 21:09.094
Once, the time Betty
just mentioned, and
decades earlier as infants.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.766
False identities.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.390
They used the paperwork
of dead infants.

21:12.480 --> 21:16.189
And, all men used
the same legal firm
to probate their wills.

21:16.651 --> 21:18.858
A tiny company called
Fisker and Associates.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.272
That's good work.

21:20.363 --> 21:23.025
I'm going to need copies of
all these files, please.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.947
Yours in five minutes.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.404
What do you think?

21:27.912 --> 21:29.777
I think that we're
on to something,

21:29.873 --> 21:31.613
I'm not exactly sure
what it is yet.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.415
What do you say
we take a trip to
Fisker and Associates?

21:36.463 --> 21:37.999
You go ahead. I've got...

21:38.089 --> 21:40.466
Things that you gotta do.
With your people.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.595
Never mind, I got this.

21:44.679 --> 21:47.386
Oh, I remember what it
was like to be that guy.

21:48.183 --> 21:49.593
I actually feel kinda
sorry for him.

21:49.684 --> 21:50.890
He's got a project,

21:51.436 --> 21:54.178
and it keeps him
away from the more
important truths.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.143
How long until
it's operational?

21:58.234 --> 21:59.770
(SCOFFING)
You can't write code
like this overnight.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.648
What I'm trying to create
is essentially sentient.

22:02.739 --> 22:05.230
And your little orange
slice makes it possible.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.907
Yeah, I'm not sure
how long it keeps
Arc in the forefront,

22:07.994 --> 22:10.235
but, I guess in your world
we only have to be first,
not the best.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.821
We can be the best,
I'm sure of it.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.917
So, more segments,
more better?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.165
More segments,
more power, so...

22:20.256 --> 22:21.666
Yeah, I guess.
More better.

22:21.758 --> 22:25.376
Except that absolute
power corrupts absolutely,
you know that whole caveat.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.085
I have no idea
what you mean.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.547
Look, what I can do with
this, right now, it's a lot.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.554
And... Are you
satisfied with that?

22:34.646 --> 22:36.557
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
With... A lot?

22:37.607 --> 22:38.892
Hello?
Alec, man,

22:39.317 --> 22:40.932
we set off some serious
trip wires here.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.733
Could really use
your help.
Are you serious?

22:42.820 --> 22:45.687
You remember NASA?
This is... This is worse.

Well, I can remote you.
Dude, / got three guys

22:47.200 --> 22:48.940

over here, okay?

compromise your server?

22:51.621 --> 22:53.577
Come on, man.
I need you.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.448
All right.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.991
I've got to...
Step out?

22:59.087 --> 23:00.543
Yeah, me too.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.085
There's great things
coming our way, Alec.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.915
I can feel it.

23:14.602 --> 23:18.686
WOMAN: Mr. Fisker will be
back shortly, are you sure
this can't wait?

23:18.773 --> 23:22.106
This is official government
business, ma'am.
I don't have time to wait.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.522
Mr. Emery Wallace. Um...

23:28.491 --> 23:30.573
Very good.
Oh, Mr. Tommy Oliver.

23:30.702 --> 23:32.158
Mmm-hmm.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.740
Do you have any information
about their beneficiaries?

23:46.342 --> 23:49.755
Mr. Warren, of course!
Of course?

23:49.846 --> 23:52.337
We come across his
name quite often.

23:52.974 --> 23:55.340
As a beneficiary,
I mean!

23:55.435 --> 23:56.891
Yeah, I see.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.730
Is this him?

Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

Have an address?

He usually drops by.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.978
I see. Thanks.

24:09.574 --> 24:12.316
You can't take those!
I just did!

24:13.161 --> 24:14.526
Excuse me.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.080
Who was that?

in the lab?

I think it is!

you'd get, anyway.

really busy saving the world,

use your help

Well then, consider it done.
Thanks, Alec.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.497
Hey, Kiera?
I was thinking that
you and Emily...

25:07.006 --> 25:08.587
What?
I don't know,

25:08.758 --> 25:10.089
Ijust think you guys
should be friends.

25:11.511 --> 25:12.921
We're friends.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.389
Just... Think about it,
okay? I gotta go!

I'm pretty?

26:10.695 --> 26:12.936
Hey. He's not here.
Then where is he?

26:13.614 --> 26:15.150
We'll find him.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.168
Garza's been here.
How...

26:31.466 --> 26:34.082
Never mind.
I'll put out an APB.

26:34.177 --> 26:36.418
Alec, please be there.

26:38.014 --> 26:40.801
Alec! Let me in!
Move!

26:41.476 --> 26:43.182
I'll be right back.

26:43.728 --> 26:45.935
Let me in!
My boyfriend lives
here, let me in!

26:46.022 --> 26:47.978
I have to get in there!

26:50.526 --> 26:52.141
What's going on?

26:52.779 --> 26:54.815
Where's Alec?
Was he here?

26:55.364 --> 26:57.821
We were.
Well, he's not here now.

What do you know?

27:20.640 --> 27:21.629
Are you?

27:22.558 --> 27:24.469
Jason, listen.
This is very important.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.642
I need you to look around,
I need you to look everywhere.

me ifA/ec is there.

Alec?

27:31.359 --> 27:33.941
He's not here...

27:34.862 --> 27:35.851
Alec?

27:51.045 --> 27:54.253
Kiera, / looked everywhere,
/ can’t find him anywhere,

27:54.340 --> 27:56.877
even looked under the couch
in case he was hiding.

27:56.968 --> 27:59.175
Okay, well, Alec will
send up a flare,

27:59.262 --> 28:01.093
we just have to figure out
where to look, that's all.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.762

if I know what to look for.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.972

been up to?

28:33.546 --> 28:35.502
Are you serious?
I'm interested.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.330
People go to a coffee shop to
talk about what they're doing!

28:37.425 --> 28:39.165
They don't show up
and kill your friends!

28:39.260 --> 28:42.172
Your friends tried to run.
Then, you should have
let them, Jesus Christ!

28:42.263 --> 28:44.504

in case it's of interest
to Liber8?

Don't try to guess,
we're talking.
That's it.

Listen to this,
three dead bodies,

28:57.778 --> 28:59.063
they're all on
the Fisker payroll.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.986
I think we need to
pay them another visit.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.735
Rattle his cage.
Set up some surveillance.

29:03.826 --> 29:04.815
I can'tjoin you.

29:05.161 --> 29:06.150
And why not?

Look, lneed you to
monitor police calls,

Anything?
Not yet.

(SIGHING) Don't worry,
he's resourceful.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.346
I'm not going
to find him here.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.052
Stay on the radar.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.723
Is he at the lab?
Have you heard anything?

29:36.817 --> 29:37.977
What aren't you telling me?

29:38.069 --> 29:40.981
If it had anything to do
with where he could be,

29:41.781 --> 29:43.237
I'd tell you.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.863
I'll keep you posted.

Not here
to talk about me.

Talk?
A talk is
a conversation!

30:29.662 --> 30:31.653
And I'm not so
good at monologues.

That's where you and I
are alike, Jasmine.

Watching.

up to me.

Like they're precious.

31:04.113 --> 31:05.853
It's not the things
that are precious,

31:05.948 --> 31:07.279

What they can do.

to your excess,

32:03.506 --> 32:04.837

to accept anything less

see what's really around me.

On our first meeting,
for instance.

32:26.403 --> 32:27.984
The guards who brought
you in just now.

32:28.072 --> 32:29.858
The girl.
What do you see?

32:30.282 --> 32:31.613
Observant.

32:32.034 --> 32:36.027
When she scanned me,
she watched my hands,
my feet, that's smart.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.447
She's a prude.
Pretended not to be,
but she is.

32:40.209 --> 32:41.324
Tired.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.796
She's a mother.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.788
Because she's tired?

32:48.134 --> 32:49.465
She had a smell.

32:49.552 --> 32:50.917
Clean. Talc.

32:52.221 --> 32:55.884
Colored wax. Crayons?
Under her fingernails.

want to grab him?

anything to her.

focus right now.

down there.

him there.

it back to life,

34:07.463 --> 34:08.873

34:08.964 --> 34:11.376
and it rewards
you with an empire.

34:12.968 --> 34:16.005
That's why being here,
right now,
is so appropriate.

34:16.847 --> 34:19.384
You asked me for a favor.
Do you know what it was?

34:19.475 --> 34:21.932
A what?
A favor, idiot boy!

34:22.019 --> 34:24.010
You,
in the future,
asked me

34:24.104 --> 34:25.605
for a favor.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.097
Can you guess
what you wanted?

34:28.192 --> 34:30.649
Dating advice?
No, silly.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.943
I want something
different this time.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.567
It's too late
to ask for that.

34:35.658 --> 34:37.740
I've always found you
an interesting girl.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.983
Intelligent, creative.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.366
I imagine Kagame values
these attributes, as well.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.874
Is that why he sent
you here to kill me?

34:48.295 --> 34:49.284
(YELLING)

34:53.926 --> 34:55.882
You sent me back
here to kill you.

35:00.182 --> 35:02.514
But it makes no sense!
Why would I send you back
to kill me?

35:02.601 --> 35:05.434
Because you knew you
were a bad, bad boy.

35:05.521 --> 35:06.681
Yeah, but I know what
I'm supposed to do,

35:06.772 --> 35:08.273
Isentback
a message with Kiera!

35:08.357 --> 35:11.724
What message?
To consider every step.
To change my path!

35:11.944 --> 35:13.605
People don't change.
I think they can.

35:13.696 --> 35:16.358
Oh, shit can change you,
but choosing?

35:16.949 --> 35:19.110
You don't even know me!
What makes you think
that I can't change?

35:19.201 --> 35:21.157
What ifyou could
change the course
of history, Jasmine?

35:21.245 --> 35:23.577
What if?
I mean really change it?

35:25.291 --> 35:27.282
Please.
Please, what?

35:27.376 --> 35:29.958
Please don't kill me.
I'm not killing you.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.376
I'm saving the world.

35:31.714 --> 35:35.206
No. But I gave you
the choice, didn't I?

35:35.843 --> 35:38.300
I mean, people keep
telling me I'm so powerful
in the future, but,

35:38.387 --> 35:39.843
I gave you this decision.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.763
It's easy to be judge and jury
now when I've done so much

35:42.850 --> 35:44.340
and made my mistakes.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.384
But I see something
in you, Jasmine.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.557
I want you to decide.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.276
I must have wanted
you to decide.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.440
VVhy?

35:56.905 --> 35:59.738
Because you were on
the outside.
You were free of the shackles.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.941
You had perspective
that I must have lost.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.620
Shit.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.290
You're my insurance policy!

He's not a part of this.
He's all of it!

36:25.601 --> 36:27.592
And I decide his fate!
Why now?

36:28.020 --> 36:30.602
He sent me to do this!

36:30.689 --> 36:33.271
That boy is not
the man that you met.

36:33.359 --> 36:36.601
Not brilliant?
Notcunous?
Not driven?

36:36.695 --> 36:38.856
KIERA: But now he
understands the danger.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.153
He won't choose
that path again.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.855
We all have good intentions
when we start.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.532
Don't do it, Garza.
I know who he is!

36:44.620 --> 36:45.735
I know what he becomes!

36:45.829 --> 36:47.285
God damn it,
neither of you know me!

36:47.373 --> 36:48.863
You don't know
shit about me!

36:48.957 --> 36:51.209
You only see what you
don't want me to be!

36:51.293 --> 36:52.328
And I'm not him!

36:52.419 --> 36:54.284
I won't be,
not after all this!

36:54.380 --> 36:57.747
After all this,
you think this will
make a difference?

36:57.841 --> 37:00.628
I'm 18 years old,
I'm supposed to
change the world

37:00.719 --> 37:03.927
and I'm afraid that
I might, I'm afraid
that I might not!

37:04.014 --> 37:05.515
You guys scare
the shit out of me!

37:05.599 --> 37:08.056
Ijust want to go home
and I want to see the girl
that I'm in love with,

37:08.143 --> 37:11.055
but instead I might
die over something
that I might not even do!

37:11.146 --> 37:12.477
(WHIMPERING)

37:14.566 --> 37:16.397
Why would you
trust me to do this?

37:16.485 --> 37:18.021
Because, unlike me,

37:18.112 --> 37:21.400
you're weak enough, and
strong enough, to love.

37:27.663 --> 37:30.530
I was willing to sacrifice
myself in your office.

37:30.624 --> 37:32.080
Nothing's changed.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.283
(GUNSHOTS FIRING)
Unless you do.

37:34.670 --> 37:35.830
(GRUNTING)

37:36.338 --> 37:37.999
Kiera!
Alec!

37:38.257 --> 37:39.417
Hold on!

37:40.968 --> 37:42.174
Kiera!

37:43.178 --> 37:44.167
Alec!

37:44.304 --> 37:46.556
Kiera!
I'm slipping!
Hold on!

37:47.433 --> 37:51.176
Alec, no, no,
I've got you!
I've got you!

37:51.395 --> 37:53.511
(GROANING)
(PANTING)

37:55.107 --> 37:58.520
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.937
Who the hell
am I in the future?

38:03.031 --> 38:05.022
I sent you to protect me.
I sent her to kill me.

38:05.659 --> 38:07.741
She didn't kill you, Alec.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.238
No, not yet.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.451
All right, let's get you
out of here. Come on.

38:17.546 --> 38:20.379
Why would a Liber8
terrorist do this to you?

38:20.799 --> 38:23.211
Kill your friends,
nearly kill you!

38:24.470 --> 38:26.677
You said it yourself,
they're terrorists.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.719
Who knows why?
Why are you doing this?

38:29.391 --> 38:31.052
Whatever this is.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.807
I'm helping the police
investigate Liber8.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.059
Kiera is one of
their specialists.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.687
I think that's all
I can tell you right now.

38:44.281 --> 38:45.566
And you're going to
keep doing this?

38:45.657 --> 38:47.613
Yes. Now, more than ever!

38:53.665 --> 38:55.951
Then, I won't let
anything happen

38:56.668 --> 38:58.283
to either of us,

39:00.547 --> 39:01.878
I promise.

39:04.927 --> 39:07.509
When did this become
the back seat

39:07.596 --> 39:09.427
at a drive-in theater?

39:10.557 --> 39:13.219
My instructions were clear.

39:13.310 --> 39:15.517
Let me make myself clear.

39:15.604 --> 39:19.188
I don't follow instructions
anymore, not from you, not
from anyone.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.230
The only opinion
that matters is mine.

39:21.318 --> 39:23.934
So if I say she gets
to be here, then
she gets to be here.

39:31.912 --> 39:33.118
Well, look at you.

39:35.791 --> 39:37.622
The boy becomes the man.

39:52.808 --> 39:55.140
I'm sorry,
I don't recognize him.

39:56.311 --> 39:59.269
I can assure you, sir,
this information is solid.

39:59.356 --> 40:01.642
So, really,
it's up to you.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.143
You can tell me everything
you know about him,

40:03.235 --> 40:05.942
or in about half an hour
I can have a warrant

40:06.029 --> 40:09.567
and a dozen agents
in here to search every
inch of this place.

40:09.658 --> 40:12.741
Please, Agent Gardiner,
let me see what I can do.

40:13.912 --> 40:17.029
I think I may have some
older files in storage.

40:17.124 --> 40:18.830
Great, go get 'em.

40:32.306 --> 40:33.921
Emily.
Hey.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.394
You saved him.
Thank you.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.189
You saved him, too.

40:47.904 --> 40:50.281
I know I've been
hard on you.
I get it.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.443
We both care about him.

40:53.035 --> 40:54.115
Fresh start?
Absolutely.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.988
Yes, that would be...

40:57.873 --> 40:58.862
Thanks.

41:02.044 --> 41:03.204
Kiera, I...

41:06.840 --> 41:08.421
I'll see you around.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.249
Yeah.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.969
Forgot the damn key.

41:26.693 --> 41:29.560
Can you find the key to
the storage locker and
bring it in here, please?

41:29.655 --> 41:31.145
I'll get my partner
to meet us here.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.570
(DOOR OPENING)

41:34.159 --> 41:35.444
(SILENCER FIRING)

41:50.384 --> 41:51.499
KIERA: Columns?

41:51.593 --> 41:52.924
ALEC: Your guess
is as good as mine.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.297
That makes it look like he's
hiding in a Roman bunker.

41:55.389 --> 41:57.801
A bunker.
So he's underground?

41:57.891 --> 42:00.803
The sound is compact, dense...
No echo, very little reverb.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.518
Without a GPS signal
I really can't give
you much more.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.147
So, the system can fail you.

42:07.234 --> 42:08.644
Temporarily.

42:12.906 --> 42:14.271
But not Arc.

42:18.829 --> 42:20.865
I think it saved your life.

42:21.957 --> 42:23.197
Huh.

42:23.792 --> 42:25.999
Hadn't thought of
it that way.

42:28.171 --> 42:31.459
KIERA: Maybe we can use it to
help find the body snatchers.

42:33.301 --> 42:35.428
Yeah.
I'll see what I can do.

42:39.516 --> 42:40.801
You okay?

42:41.226 --> 42:43.217
Yeah.
Better than I expected.

42:44.980 --> 42:48.313
I realize now I was just
afraid of the message.

42:49.401 --> 42:50.891
And my motives.

42:50.986 --> 42:53.523
I know now that none
of that matters.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.025
There is no fate.

42:56.408 --> 42:58.865
We chart our own course,
here and now.

43:07.210 --> 43:08.950
It's Gardiner.

43:09.045 --> 43:10.296
Cameron.

43:12.841 --> 43:14.377
Gardiner? Hello?

43:16.303 --> 43:17.463
Gardiner.
