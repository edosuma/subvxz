00:01.759 --> 00:02.679
Emma: No!

00:02.730 --> 00:04.781
Emma, come on, it's time for bed.

00:04.783 --> 00:06.667
I'm putting my foot down.

00:06.701 --> 00:07.768
You gotta put your pajamas on.

00:07.802 --> 00:08.818
No!

00:08.870 --> 00:11.154
What if Daddy gives you a cookie?

00:11.189 --> 00:13.073
Yes!

00:13.107 --> 00:15.092
Congratulations, Emma.

00:15.126 --> 00:17.995
You're already manipulating
men at a third grade level.

00:19.097 --> 00:20.897
You're the parent.

00:20.932 --> 00:22.082
You need to stand up to your daughter.

00:22.116 --> 00:23.934
Okay, you know what? Fine.

00:23.968 --> 00:25.902
If you're so good at this,
you get her into pajamas.

00:25.904 --> 00:27.004
- All right?
- Okay. Yeah, I will.

00:27.038 --> 00:28.021
All right, Emma.

00:28.056 --> 00:32.726
Listen, this behavior has got to stop.

00:32.759 --> 00:33.844
When I say it's bedtime,

00:33.895 --> 00:35.696
it's bedtime.

00:37.899 --> 00:40.717
And when I say it's cookie time,

00:40.768 --> 00:42.102
it's cookie time.

00:42.136 --> 00:44.121
Mm, who do you love the most?

00:44.155 --> 00:46.106
- Bon-Bon.
- Bon-Bon. That's right.

00:46.157 --> 00:48.075
And Bon-Bon loves you the most.

Danny!

01:09.097 --> 01:11.064
- Who's coming?
- My mom.

01:11.099 --> 01:13.150
Ever since Brad left,
she can't be alone.

01:13.184 --> 01:14.685
I don't know if you know this,

01:14.687 --> 01:16.103
but she can be kind of annoying.

01:17.188 --> 01:19.940
She hasn't let me out of
her sight in over a week,

01:19.991 --> 01:22.075
and now she wants to hang
out today and tonight.

01:22.110 --> 01:24.695
No! No! Tonight is our special night.

01:24.697 --> 01:26.029
<i>Clash of Dragons is on.</i>

01:26.031 --> 01:28.949
I know. That's why I'm
trying to avoid her.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
(doorknob rattling)

01:30.034 --> 01:32.035
Bonnie: Hey, why is this door locked?

01:32.037 --> 01:33.954
(door unlocking)

01:34.005 --> 01:35.088
- Oh!
- Hey, guys.

01:35.123 --> 01:36.123
I just wanted to...

01:41.212 --> 01:43.013
Oh. Mom...

01:43.047 --> 01:44.014
do you mind?

01:44.048 --> 01:46.016
Kind of in the middle of something here.

01:46.050 --> 01:47.050
Sorry.

01:47.052 --> 01:49.019
Yeah, I can come back.

01:49.053 --> 01:50.187
Well, actually, if you're
anything like your dad,

01:50.221 --> 01:52.189
I can just wait in the hall
for a couple of minutes.

01:54.142 --> 01:56.026
Will you just tell her?

01:56.060 --> 01:58.145
Yeah, you're right.

01:58.196 --> 02:01.064
Mom, there's something I
need to talk to you about.

02:01.115 --> 02:02.949
But first, I gotta go to practice,

02:02.984 --> 02:04.651
so I'll see you later, okay? Bye.

02:04.702 --> 02:05.952
Danny, Danny, Danny!

02:05.987 --> 02:07.070
(groans)

02:07.121 --> 02:08.989
So...

02:09.039 --> 02:10.657
what are you up to today?

02:10.708 --> 02:12.075
I'm just going to work.

02:12.077 --> 02:13.960
I don't suppose you
could bring a friend.

02:13.995 --> 02:14.995
- Not really.
- Oh.

02:18.049 --> 02:19.049
Oh, Tuck! Hey!

02:19.083 --> 02:21.001
Here's that salad you ordered for Mary.

02:21.052 --> 02:22.919
I know the show's paying for it.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.054
That's why it's a $53 salad.

02:25.106 --> 02:27.874
Finally. Mary's blood sugar's crashing.

02:29.877 --> 02:31.828
Oh, my God. Are there
cranberries on this?

02:32.830 --> 02:34.097
These look like cranberries!

02:34.148 --> 02:36.783
Calm down. She can just pick
them off like any normal person.

02:36.818 --> 02:39.736
Mary Hart is not a normal person.

02:39.738 --> 02:40.704
Okay?

02:40.738 --> 02:41.738
She's a star.

02:41.773 --> 02:43.140
It's a completely different beast.

02:44.759 --> 02:46.693
Please don't tell anyone you
heard me call her a beast.

02:46.727 --> 02:49.079
Dude, you gotta stand up
to her once in a while.

02:49.081 --> 02:50.113
Don't let her walk all over you.

02:50.148 --> 02:51.681
Look, Ben, I don't have time.

02:51.732 --> 02:53.116
Look, I don't have time
for this right now, okay?

02:53.118 --> 02:54.968
What is wrong with
you? Look at yourself.

02:55.002 --> 02:56.136
- You're a mess.
- I'm fine! Okay?!

02:56.187 --> 02:57.954
- Look, I'm fine!
- (Shutter clicks)

02:57.989 --> 02:59.990
- I'm fi...
- Does this look fine to you?

03:00.024 --> 03:02.826
Look, man, we're just... we're all
under a lot of stress, all right?

03:02.877 --> 03:05.762
<i>This week, it's our big
Mary Hart SweetHarts Special,</i>

03:05.764 --> 03:07.764
and everything just needs to be perfect

03:07.799 --> 03:09.766
because Mary likes perfect.

03:09.801 --> 03:10.767
Mary: Tucker!

03:10.769 --> 03:12.652
Oh, my God! She's
coming! Save yourself! Go!

03:13.788 --> 03:15.088
It's about time.

03:15.123 --> 03:17.073
I didn't realize you actually had

03:17.108 --> 03:19.676
to go to a farm and plant
the vegetables first.

03:21.028 --> 03:23.980
And could you possibly
be more incompetent?

03:24.015 --> 03:26.917
I said I wanted to
give away Crock-Pots.

03:26.919 --> 03:28.985
You forgot the "Crock"
part of the "Pot".

03:29.020 --> 03:31.788
There's 50 pounds of weed
sitting on my loading dock!

03:35.760 --> 03:36.760
And...

03:37.829 --> 03:39.796
are these cranberries?

03:40.848 --> 03:45.769
You know how much I hate cranberries.

03:45.771 --> 03:48.054
I know, Mary. I'm so sorry, Mary.

03:48.089 --> 03:50.173
How does this sound to you, Tucker?

03:50.175 --> 03:54.010
Hello, America. I'm Mary Hart.

03:54.012 --> 03:56.963
On tonight's show, the
death of a senior producer

03:56.998 --> 03:58.932
who gave me cranberries!

03:58.966 --> 03:59.983
Idiot!

04:00.034 --> 04:01.952
How could you not know after
all these years together

04:02.003 --> 04:04.905
that I hate cranberries?! I hate them...

04:07.708 --> 04:09.860
Ah, my good Lord Craigmore,

04:09.894 --> 04:12.696
bastard son of Leon Ravenhelm,

04:12.730 --> 04:14.764
to what do I owe this honor?

04:14.799 --> 04:17.750
Ah, Lady Zelda Dragonbreast,

04:18.803 --> 04:20.769
I have come to avenge thee...

04:20.805 --> 04:23.073
and perhaps do some ravaging?

04:23.075 --> 04:26.009
Well, the ravaging will hate to wait

04:26.011 --> 04:27.277
because seriously, the
show's about to start.

04:27.311 --> 04:29.963
I couldn't find mutton, so
chicken wings will have to do.

04:29.997 --> 04:31.915
(knocking)

04:31.949 --> 04:33.066
Bonnie: Open up! It's me!

04:33.117 --> 04:34.918
I found mutton!

04:36.020 --> 04:37.988
What is she doing
here? How did she know?

04:38.039 --> 04:40.874
Well, she either figured
it out on her own,

04:40.908 --> 04:42.943
or she guilted me into inviting her.

04:42.977 --> 04:44.794
I'm honestly not sure.

04:44.796 --> 04:45.812
Just...

04:45.846 --> 04:46.863
just tell her to go away.

04:46.898 --> 04:47.864
Okay, fine.

04:47.915 --> 04:49.766
I'll tell her that it's just us tonight.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.151
Yeah.

04:51.185 --> 04:52.752
I mean, sure. Yeah.

04:52.787 --> 04:56.056
I was devastated when
Brad left, you know,

04:56.090 --> 04:58.174
but now, I'm just lonely.

04:58.176 --> 05:00.944
You know, and I can't
go get all un-lonely

05:00.995 --> 05:02.095
because I'm married.

05:02.129 --> 05:03.847
Stupid morals.

05:05.917 --> 05:08.802
<i>Mary: Hello, America. I'm Mary Hart.</i>

05:08.836 --> 05:11.755
On tonight's show, the

05:11.806 --> 05:13.740
who gave me cranberries!

05:14.859 --> 05:16.760
Yeah, thanks for the instant replay,

05:16.794 --> 05:17.844
but I'm still picking

05:17.895 --> 05:20.680
the cranberries out of
my ears, so I'm good.

05:20.715 --> 05:23.099
Dude, I'm trying to show
you how pathetic you look.

05:23.134 --> 05:25.118
You know, I wish I had
physical proof of my mistakes.

05:25.169 --> 05:26.136
Ben!

05:26.138 --> 05:28.104
Not now, Emma.

05:28.106 --> 05:30.974
Ben, why is this such a big deal?

05:30.976 --> 05:34.995
All I see is a completely normal
employee-employer relationship.

05:35.046 --> 05:36.096
Oh? Oh, is that what you see?

05:36.130 --> 05:37.981
Oh, okay. Then maybe
we should take a survey

05:38.032 --> 05:38.999
and find out what other people think.

05:39.033 --> 05:40.850
How about I just post it online

05:40.885 --> 05:41.918
and get some feedback for you?

05:41.920 --> 05:43.036
- Oh, you do that.
- Oh, I will.

05:43.070 --> 05:44.771
- Good.
- Here I go.

05:44.822 --> 05:45.889
- I'm waiting.
- So doing it.

05:45.923 --> 05:46.873
- So not caring.
- All right.

05:46.924 --> 05:47.958
- Three, two, one...
- Give it to me.

05:47.960 --> 05:48.959
Nope. No. Stop.

05:48.993 --> 05:49.893
No, no.

05:51.862 --> 05:54.731
Fine. Yes, Mary is a horrible person.

05:54.765 --> 05:56.149
She's also a compulsive gambler

05:56.200 --> 05:58.084
and a philanderer, so what's your point?

05:58.135 --> 05:59.135
You're better than this!

05:59.186 --> 06:01.638
You've gotta stand up for yourself, man.

06:01.672 --> 06:02.088
(sighs)

06:03.658 --> 06:04.958
Fine. I'll talk to her.

06:06.127 --> 06:07.927
You're a good friend.

06:07.979 --> 06:08.945
I know.

06:08.996 --> 06:09.996
You're really lucky.

06:11.115 --> 06:13.833
How about I buy you a
beer to celebrate, huh?

06:13.868 --> 06:14.951
Come on.

06:23.894 --> 06:25.679
Idiot! How could you not

06:25.713 --> 06:26.813
remember after all of these years...

06:29.116 --> 06:30.667
(Ben laughing)

06:30.701 --> 06:31.768
Look! The kitty doesn't even know

06:31.802 --> 06:33.687
the bunny's in the basket.

06:33.721 --> 06:35.038
Cats are stupid.

06:39.043 --> 06:40.126
I think we lost her!

06:40.177 --> 06:41.978
I knew your mom was fast,

06:41.980 --> 06:44.914
but she actually scissor-kicked
over the subway turnstiles.

06:44.916 --> 06:46.816
You guys are amateurs.

06:46.867 --> 06:47.951
Always run through a bar.

06:48.002 --> 06:48.968
She has to stop.

06:50.821 --> 06:51.771
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:51.822 --> 06:52.806
Wait, wait, wait. This isn't good.

06:52.840 --> 06:53.957
<i>Cranberries? Idiot!</i>

06:54.008 --> 06:56.810

<i>of working together how
much I hate cranberries?!</i>

No!

07:00.731 --> 07:02.682
Oh, my God! How is this online?!

07:02.717 --> 07:03.717
A million views?!

07:03.751 --> 07:05.101
Oh, my God. I have to warn Tucker.

07:05.136 --> 07:06.653
Oh, no. Come on.

07:06.704 --> 07:07.987
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

07:08.022 --> 07:10.090
Aah, pick up. Pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up.

07:10.141 --> 07:11.074
Oh, God.

07:13.044 --> 07:14.894

Mom! Hey, perfect.

07:17.081 --> 07:18.882
Can you please take Emma to daycare?

07:18.916 --> 07:20.850
I have an emergency.
Mary's about to kill Tucker.

07:20.852 --> 07:21.985
Oh. Yeah. Tell me when that's on.

07:21.987 --> 07:22.952
I want to record it.

07:24.872 --> 07:25.872
Riley: Oh, my God, Danny. Please!

07:25.923 --> 07:27.724
Your mother is driving me crazy!

07:27.726 --> 07:28.875
Danny: Don't get mad at me!

07:28.909 --> 07:30.844
You're the one who invited
her over last night!

07:30.911 --> 07:34.664
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's only because
you couldn't stand up to her.

07:34.666 --> 07:36.099
She spent the night at my place

07:36.150 --> 07:37.767
and then she went to breakfast with us,

07:37.802 --> 07:39.669
and now she's gonna go
to the movies with us?

07:39.703 --> 07:41.054
Oh, my...
Oh, do not.

07:41.105 --> 07:42.238
Do not think for one second

07:42.273 --> 07:44.007
<i>that she's going to Mary
Hart's SweetHart show</i>

07:44.041 --> 07:45.125
tomorrow because we
only have two tickets

07:45.159 --> 07:47.043
and I already planned to
give the free Crock-Pot

07:47.078 --> 07:48.078
to my mom for Christmas!

07:48.129 --> 07:50.847
Well, what am I supposed to do?

07:50.898 --> 07:52.916
Tell her I'd rather spend
time along with my girlfriend

07:52.950 --> 07:54.884
than with my own mother?!

07:54.886 --> 07:55.935
Yes.

07:55.986 --> 07:58.738
Danny, that's exactly
what you're supposed to do.

07:59.757 --> 08:00.890
I mean, if you don't
stand up to her now,

08:00.941 --> 08:02.792
this is only going to get worse.

08:02.827 --> 08:04.794
I mean, today it's a Crock-Pot,

08:04.845 --> 08:06.646
tomorrow it's our anniversary.

08:06.697 --> 08:08.081
Wait, tomorrow's our anniversary?

08:09.133 --> 08:10.717
I mean...

08:10.751 --> 08:12.068
tomorrow's our anniversary.

08:12.119 --> 08:14.003
Hope you didn't forget.

08:18.008 --> 08:20.059
No, Danny.

08:20.111 --> 08:22.962
I am saying that this
is about our future,

08:23.013 --> 08:25.815
and I'm not saying that you
have to choose between us,

08:25.866 --> 08:26.966
but at some point,

08:27.001 --> 08:29.853
you're gonna have to choose between us.

08:30.955 --> 08:34.890
Oh, I think we both know
how this is gonna end.

08:34.893 --> 08:37.876
Someone is about to get schooled...

08:37.928 --> 08:39.779
and it ain't gonna be me.

08:39.813 --> 08:41.714
High five it.

08:41.749 --> 08:42.749
Fist it.

08:42.799 --> 08:43.765
Woogidy woogidy.

08:48.775 --> 08:51.101
Care to explain what this is?

08:51.799 --> 08:52.766
Oh. You know what?

08:52.850 --> 08:54.785
It's basically just a really big phone.

08:56.738 --> 08:57.738
You know what I mean?

08:57.740 --> 08:59.723
No, this.

08:59.757 --> 09:02.659
<i>There's 50 pounds of
weed on my loading dock.</i>

09:04.512 --> 09:06.496
Oh, no, no, no. This is not happening.

09:06.531 --> 09:07.581
(inhales deeply)

09:08.616 --> 09:10.434
(breathes deeply)

09:10.485 --> 09:13.503
They're saying, "Mary has no Hart."

09:13.538 --> 09:17.391
I wish that didn't sound so
evil because it's catchy as hell.

09:17.425 --> 09:19.393
No! No, no, no.

09:19.427 --> 09:20.744
No, of course you have a heart!

09:20.778 --> 09:22.796
No, Mary puts the Hart in heart.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.797
♪ Mary ♪

09:23.848 --> 09:25.649
Right?

09:25.700 --> 09:27.768
Obviously someone is jealous

09:27.802 --> 09:30.704
of our close, professional relationship.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.523
Perhaps I overreacted
with the cranberries.

09:34.609 --> 09:36.543
I'm... I'm sorry,
are you apologizing?

09:36.545 --> 09:38.395
Oh, my God, no.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.515
But seeing this made me realize

09:41.566 --> 09:44.785
just how much I... appreciate you.

09:44.836 --> 09:48.872
So, I want to make you
an executive producer...

09:48.923 --> 09:51.775
as long as you find out who did this,

09:51.809 --> 09:54.678
publicly humiliate them, and fire them.

09:54.729 --> 09:55.729
I'm on it.

09:55.763 --> 09:56.697
Thank you, Mary.

09:56.731 --> 09:58.799
Tucker, hey! Whatever you do, don't...

09:58.833 --> 10:00.801
What's up, Mary?

10:00.835 --> 10:03.670
Well, hello there, stranger.

10:05.556 --> 10:07.607
Wait, why do you look so familiar?

10:07.642 --> 10:09.676
I work here.

10:09.711 --> 10:11.495
I'm, um...

10:11.529 --> 10:12.612
I'm Jason.

10:12.647 --> 10:14.598
What do you do here, Jason?

10:17.585 --> 10:19.453
I make the melon balls.

10:21.456 --> 10:23.440
Well, make them smaller next time.

10:23.474 --> 10:25.909
It's bad for my face to chew.

10:30.748 --> 10:31.798
Danny: Mom?

10:31.833 --> 10:33.684
(door closes)

10:33.735 --> 10:35.736
Oh, hey, Ma.

10:35.738 --> 10:37.587
Mamacita.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.523
Best mom in the world.

10:39.557 --> 10:40.640
I was hoping we could
have a little chat...

10:41.709 --> 10:42.626
Are you crying?

10:43.678 --> 10:44.928
It's nothing.

10:46.564 --> 10:49.516
I was just sitting here thinking
about you, and, you know,

10:49.567 --> 10:53.854
how amazing you've been during
this painful, awful time.

10:53.888 --> 10:55.489
You're not just my son.

10:56.808 --> 10:57.891
You're my best friend.

11:00.712 --> 11:02.763
And all my friends,
you know, they complain

11:02.814 --> 11:05.665
that their kids never want
to spend any time with them,

11:05.667 --> 11:07.768
but not me. No.

11:07.770 --> 11:12.556
I always say, "I have the
best son in the world."

11:13.608 --> 11:15.459
- What about Ben?
- What about Ben?

11:19.530 --> 11:20.514
Listen, honey.

11:20.548 --> 11:22.866
I know that I have been
very intrusive lately,

11:22.900 --> 11:26.853
but you have honestly saved my life.

11:26.855 --> 11:28.905
You know I'd do anything for you, Mom.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.424
I know.

11:30.475 --> 11:33.693
And you know what would really help me?

11:33.745 --> 11:35.796
Make me feel whole again?

11:35.847 --> 11:39.750
I would just really love
to go to that Mary Hart

11:39.801 --> 11:42.569
whatever-she-calls-it
thing with you.

11:42.603 --> 11:44.504
<i>Wait, the SweetHart Special?</i>

11:44.539 --> 11:45.705
But I've only got two tickets

11:45.740 --> 11:47.524
and Riley's got her heart set on it.

11:47.558 --> 11:49.593
I mean, we've got our costumes
picked out and everything.

11:51.562 --> 11:53.497
That is a problem...

11:55.600 --> 11:57.517
but I know you'll do the right thing.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.720
Look at myself.

12:02.740 --> 12:04.708
Dude, I'm gonna get my
own Tucker to scream at!

12:04.759 --> 12:06.810
But don't you still have to
find a fall guy and fire someone?

12:06.844 --> 12:09.646
Oh, please. Believe me, I've got a list.

12:10.715 --> 12:12.666
Enjoy your last stolen yogurt, Todd.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.668
Payback for my applesauce, bitch.

12:20.525 --> 12:21.541
Hey!

12:22.593 --> 12:24.511
What about Jason?

12:24.545 --> 12:25.729
I have the advantage
of actually being guilty

12:25.763 --> 12:28.432
and I don't actually work here,
so no one actually gets hurt.

12:28.483 --> 12:29.433
Yeah!

12:29.467 --> 12:30.450
Yeah, that's genius!

12:30.485 --> 12:32.452
Mary!

12:32.454 --> 12:34.438
After an extensive investigation

12:34.472 --> 12:36.523
I've traced the video to Jason's phone.

12:36.557 --> 12:39.810
Well, Jason, why don't you just
take that pretty face of yours

12:39.861 --> 12:43.630
and your melon baller
and get out? You're fired!

12:45.700 --> 12:46.700
(gasps)

12:46.751 --> 12:48.802
I can't believe we just
got away with that, man!

12:48.804 --> 12:49.803
We're geniuses!

12:49.805 --> 12:52.706
I mean, Mary is kind of a moron, right?

12:52.757 --> 12:55.675
I mean, like, a big, dumb blond.

12:55.710 --> 12:57.527
That thing's not actually on, is it?

12:57.562 --> 12:58.545
No. This?

12:58.547 --> 12:59.546
I'm not an idiot.

12:59.597 --> 13:01.448
Mary: Tucker!

13:03.885 --> 13:05.485
Yeah, I guess it is on.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.805
What flavor do you want
your goodbye cake to be?

13:08.840 --> 13:09.840
(chuckles)

13:09.891 --> 13:12.492
- No!
- No, no, no...

13:15.525 --> 13:16.659
Fired.

13:16.693 --> 13:18.510
Man, I did not see that coming.

13:20.513 --> 13:22.331
You shot the video,

13:22.382 --> 13:24.350
your kid posted it online,

13:24.401 --> 13:26.468
and it was your idea to fire Jason.

13:26.503 --> 13:28.437
You were in charge of it coming.

13:30.290 --> 13:30.838
Oh, yeah?

13:30.938 --> 13:32.358
Well, I worked in TV for one hour,

13:32.392 --> 13:34.410
and even I know how the headsets work.

13:34.461 --> 13:37.396
I know how the headsets work, okay?!

13:37.430 --> 13:39.648
And I also know how friends work.

13:39.650 --> 13:40.633
And if you weren't so busy

13:40.667 --> 13:42.668
trying to teach me some stupid lesson,

13:42.702 --> 13:44.270
none of this would have happened.

13:44.321 --> 13:45.254
(sighs)

13:45.288 --> 13:47.473
This is my career, Ben.

13:47.507 --> 13:48.607
And you just destroyed it.

13:50.493 --> 13:51.427
(sighs)

13:56.499 --> 13:58.350
Oh, hey. How am I doing?

13:58.401 --> 14:00.369
Funny you should ask. Um, not well.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.304
Because despite my talking

14:02.339 --> 14:04.440
<i>about the Mary Hart Special
for the last six months,</i>

14:04.442 --> 14:06.342
I am now not going.

14:06.376 --> 14:08.310
Am I supposed to have any
idea what you're talking about?

14:09.362 --> 14:10.379
Shiver me timbers!

14:10.413 --> 14:12.314
Who's ready to hunt some dragons?

14:12.349 --> 14:13.315
Tally ho!

14:17.203 --> 14:19.521
<i>No one on Clash of
Dragons has said that.</i>

14:19.572 --> 14:20.539
Ever.

14:21.675 --> 14:23.192
Is Danny ready?

14:23.226 --> 14:24.560
This corset's got about four hours on it

14:24.611 --> 14:26.462
before m'ladies explode.

14:26.496 --> 14:28.514
(giggles) Thanks for the ticket, Riley.

14:30.483 --> 14:33.502
Your mom stole my boyfriend.

14:33.504 --> 14:37.373
Uh, kind of the one woman I didn't
think I'd have to worry about.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.391
Well, Tucker gave me two
tickets. You can have 'em.

14:39.426 --> 14:41.226
Really? Oh, my God!

14:41.277 --> 14:42.361
Well, will you go with me?

14:42.395 --> 14:43.412
Because you can only get in

14:43.414 --> 14:45.297
if you're dressed as a
famous couple from history.

14:45.332 --> 14:46.348
Please, please, please?

14:46.399 --> 14:48.200
Uh, well, won't me going
with you make Danny...

14:48.234 --> 14:49.335
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

14:49.386 --> 14:52.204
And that's what us
girlfriends call a win-win.

14:53.656 --> 14:55.591
No, no, no. I can't. I can't.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.526
Do you have any idea what
Mary would do if she sees me?

14:57.560 --> 14:59.194
I mean, after she hits on me of course.

15:00.547 --> 15:01.597
She may not like my melon balls,

15:01.599 --> 15:03.499
but she definitely likes
my... You get the point.

15:06.419 --> 15:07.403
You know what?

15:07.454 --> 15:09.338
That's genius!

15:09.372 --> 15:10.472
Yes, yes! I will go with you!

15:10.507 --> 15:11.690
Okay. Yay!

15:11.725 --> 15:14.326
All right, what's a costume that
we can do at the last minute?

15:14.377 --> 15:16.428
Um, I've got a black
wig and some 60s clothes.

15:16.479 --> 15:17.429
Sonny and Cher?

15:17.480 --> 15:19.281
Yes!

15:19.283 --> 15:21.200
Oh, my God, that's perfect!

15:21.234 --> 15:23.252
Plus, they were great
friends after their breakup,

15:23.286 --> 15:24.353
and you know, it's... it's just like us!

15:24.355 --> 15:26.655
Yeah, so totally like us! Yeah!

15:26.689 --> 15:27.639
(chuckles)

15:29.000 --> 15:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:39.602 --> 15:40.569
Really?

15:42.405 --> 15:43.555
How was I supposed to
know you wanted to be Cher?

15:45.375 --> 15:48.394
Uh, again, I'm gonna go with, "Really?"

15:55.268 --> 15:57.302
Riley? What are you doing here?

15:57.337 --> 15:58.353
And why are you with my brother?

16:00.206 --> 16:03.175
I don't know, because Ben
didn't dump me for his mother?

16:03.226 --> 16:05.227
Because Ben is a true friend.

16:05.229 --> 16:07.229
Because Ben would never abandon me.

16:07.263 --> 16:08.180
Ben's gotta go.

16:08.214 --> 16:09.631
See you later, Riles. Wish me luck.

16:09.666 --> 16:11.617
- Hey, Sonny.
- Hey, Mom.

16:14.587 --> 16:15.604
Oh, hey, Riles.

16:15.606 --> 16:17.406
Ever hear the expression,

16:17.457 --> 16:20.509
"Two is company, three is a pathetic
girl dressed as Cher with no partner"?

16:21.528 --> 16:22.444
Tucker?

16:24.531 --> 16:26.381
What are you doing?

16:26.383 --> 16:29.284
I found this costume on the couch.

16:29.286 --> 16:31.437
Figured it was the perfect
way to get past security.

16:31.471 --> 16:34.189
Don't you work here?

16:34.224 --> 16:36.325
Oh. Oh, when I'm done with this show,

16:36.359 --> 16:38.627
nobody is gonna work here.

16:38.661 --> 16:39.628
Okay?

16:39.662 --> 16:42.181
It's time I got my dignity back.

16:47.637 --> 16:49.571
Hey, Mary. It's me, Jason.

16:51.591 --> 16:53.475
What are you doing here?

16:53.477 --> 16:55.410
I think we both know
what I'm doing here.

16:55.462 --> 16:56.528
I saw how you looked at me before.

17:01.334 --> 17:03.385
Oh, you're here to seduce me just like

17:03.436 --> 17:06.454
the real Sonny did in '79.

17:06.489 --> 17:08.223
You bet I am.

17:08.273 --> 17:10.392
Should we lock the doors so your
husband doesn't walk in on us?

17:10.425 --> 17:13.262
Please, I've done this 100 times before

17:13.313 --> 17:14.613
and he never found out.

17:14.646 --> 17:16.147
He's about as in the dark

17:16.182 --> 17:18.150
as the IRS is about my Swiss accounts.

17:18.184 --> 17:19.184
Now...

17:19.234 --> 17:22.503
why don't you make a
deposit at Infidelity Bank?

17:23.640 --> 17:25.507
<i>- Gotcha!
- Mary: Now...</i>

17:25.541 --> 17:28.644
<i>why don't you make a
deposit at Infidelity Bank?</i>

17:28.678 --> 17:30.646
What do you want?

17:30.648 --> 17:32.531
I want you to give Tucker his job back

17:32.582 --> 17:34.383
unless you want this to get out too.

17:34.434 --> 17:36.368
You know he deserves it.

17:36.402 --> 17:37.486
He does everything to please you

17:37.537 --> 17:39.471
and all you've ever
done is crush his spirit.

17:39.506 --> 17:41.390
Fine.

17:41.441 --> 17:43.325
I actually need Tucker.

17:43.376 --> 17:46.278
His little revenge video
doubled the show ratings.

17:46.312 --> 17:48.197
So he can have his job back?

17:48.199 --> 17:49.181
Sure.

17:49.215 --> 17:50.315
Now put the mustache on

17:50.350 --> 17:53.585
and take me back to 1979.

17:56.673 --> 17:58.524
Okay, SweetHarts,

17:58.575 --> 18:00.158
let's do this.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.159
Hey, hey.

18:01.194 --> 18:02.177
Where's your partner?

18:02.228 --> 18:03.478
Oh, he was just here.

18:03.513 --> 18:04.580
Sorry, couples only.

18:04.614 --> 18:06.415
Desperate singles is next week.

18:06.466 --> 18:08.025
If you could just give me a
minute, he'll be right back.

18:08.051 --> 18:08.600
Rules are rules.

18:08.635 --> 18:11.453
- I swear.
- You two, you two, next.

18:11.455 --> 18:12.554
Riley, I am so sorry.

18:12.589 --> 18:14.306
Danny, come on! Hurry up.

18:14.357 --> 18:16.325
The gay pirate boys
are taking our seats!

18:16.359 --> 18:18.377
As soon as this is over, I'm
going to make it up to you.

18:18.428 --> 18:20.379
Danny, come on! I gave you life!

18:20.413 --> 18:22.231
She's just giving you a hard time.

18:22.282 --> 18:24.333
- Can you give me a minute?
- No, Danny. It's fine. Not now.

18:24.367 --> 18:26.301
- Yeah, Danny. Not now.
- Mom, enough!

18:26.352 --> 18:29.238
You've been controlling, bossy,
and honestly, a pain in my neck.

18:29.289 --> 18:30.622
I'm sorry that you're lonely,

18:30.673 --> 18:32.307
but you're not the woman that I love.

18:32.309 --> 18:33.575
Riley is.

18:33.610 --> 18:36.178
So, you need to back up out
of my life and get your own.

18:40.583 --> 18:42.551
Well, it's about time!

18:43.686 --> 18:44.653
Both: What?

18:46.422 --> 18:49.408
Danny, I have been in your
face the last two days,

18:49.442 --> 18:51.526
trying to get you to push me away.

18:51.528 --> 18:53.378
No man should let his
mother come between

18:53.429 --> 18:54.513
him and the love of his life.

18:54.547 --> 18:57.332
And no woman wants to be with a guy

18:57.367 --> 18:58.450
who can't stand up to his mother.

19:00.303 --> 19:02.271
Now, if you'll excuse me,

19:02.322 --> 19:04.373
I was right about this corset

19:04.407 --> 19:08.176
and my m'ladies are about to blow, so...

19:10.163 --> 19:11.280
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

19:12.382 --> 19:14.182
Tucker?

19:14.217 --> 19:15.200
How many times do I have to tell you

19:15.234 --> 19:16.285
to stop stealing my clothes?

19:17.620 --> 19:19.137
It doesn't matter. I got great news.

19:19.172 --> 19:20.138
So do I, man.

19:20.189 --> 19:22.140
Look, I finally realized you were right.

19:22.175 --> 19:25.227
This job, this humiliation,
it's beneath me.

19:25.261 --> 19:27.179
I am better than Mary Hart.

19:27.213 --> 19:28.530
- I got your job back.
- Oh, my God! You did?!

19:28.581 --> 19:30.465
That's amazing!

19:30.500 --> 19:31.516
I love this job!

Hey, Mom, watch this.

20:23.249 --> 20:25.200
Emma, it's time for bed.

20:25.251 --> 20:26.284
Let's go put your pajamas on, okay?

20:26.335 --> 20:27.335
Okay.
