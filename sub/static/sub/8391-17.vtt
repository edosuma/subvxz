00:01.100 --> 00:02.499
- HI, DAD.
HE'S CHANGED NOW!

00:02.550 --> 00:05.269
- I REMEMBER
HOW THINGS WERE AT HOME.

00:05.310 --> 00:07.278
- IT'S REALLY GOOD FOR HIM,
YOU KNOW, TO SEE HIS DAD.

00:07.310 --> 00:08.823
IT REALLY IS.
- IS IT? I DON'T KNOW.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.519
- I WROTE THIS ONE
WITH MY EX-WIFE.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.767
THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY
ABOUT THAT.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.449
- I CAN'T MARRY SOMEONE

00:14.490 --> 00:16.139
WHO WILL NOT LET ME MAKE
ANY DECISIONS.

00:16.180 --> 00:18.523
I'M STARTING TO REALIZE
THAT YOU ARE VERY CONTROLLING.

00:18.570 --> 00:20.526
- WANT THIS BACK?
- WHY ARE YOU IN THE DOGHOUSE?

00:20.570 --> 00:23.323
- APPARENTLY, I'M--I SHOULDN'T
BE MAKING ANY DECISIONS.

00:23.360 --> 00:25.225
- SHE'S YOUR FIANCEE,
BY THE WAY.

00:25.260 --> 00:28.502
ALSO, I WORK HERE, AND I DON'T
WANT TO MESS THAT UP.

00:31.720 --> 00:37.135
- I LEFI' WHILE YOU
WERE SLEEPING

00:37.170 --> 00:42.346
WHILE ABRAHAM
SHAPED YOUR SIGH

00:42.380 --> 00:45.383
NEVER LOVED YOU LESS

00:45.420 --> 00:48.594
NEVER LOVED YOU MORE

00:48.630 --> 00:53.499
AS WHEN SIRIUS
HUNG IN THE SKY

00:53.530 --> 00:59.469
A MEMORY IS A LIAR

00:59.500 --> 01:01.149
WAS I
[door closes]

01:01.190 --> 01:04.819
A WOMAN
TO NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN

01:04.850 --> 01:10.379
OR AM I DREAMING ASLEEP
BY YOUR SIDE?

01:18.420 --> 01:20.342
[overlapping chatter]
- HEY, EVERYBODY!

01:20.390 --> 01:22.108
- HE'S SO CONFIDENT...
- GOOD JOB.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.596
- WHO IS READY
FOR MY FAMOUS PANCAKES?

01:24.630 --> 01:26.427
- HEY, HONEY.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.564
- HEY, MR. BRAVERMAN.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.568
- HOW YOU DOING? MAX, I GOT
ONE MORE TRICK TO SHOW YOU,

01:30.600 --> 01:32.113
BUT YOU GOT TO SAY HI
TO YOUR DAD FIRST.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.661
- HEY, DAD!
- HI, HONEY.

01:33.710 --> 01:35.359
- HI.
- THE TRICK IS...

01:35.400 --> 01:37.846
YOU GOT TO LIGHTLY TOSS IT AND
THEN POP IT OFF YOUR FOREARM.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.266
IT'S A FAKE PASS.
IT'S A TRICK.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.369
IT'S LIKE THAT.
THAT'S IT.

01:40.410 --> 01:42.366
- THANKS FOR GOING
TO THE MARKET.

01:42.410 --> 01:43.741
- HE'S HERE AGAIN.

01:43.790 --> 01:45.678
- OKAY.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.585
- HONEY, I MEAN,
YOU KNOW...

01:47.620 --> 01:49.349
HE'S BEEN HERE
EVERY DAY THIS WEEK,

01:49.380 --> 01:50.415
AND IT'S SUNDAY, YOU KNOW?

01:50.450 --> 01:52.338
IT'S MY PANCAKE-MAKING DAY.
IT'S FAMILY TIME.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.245
- YOU NEED TO RELAX.
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

01:54.280 --> 01:55.554
- I'M RELAXED.
- IT'S MY FAULT.

01:55.590 --> 01:57.217
I SAID IT WAS OKAY.
- OH, OKAY.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.763
SO HE'S JUST GONNA BE HERE NOW
ALL THE TIME.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.176
- I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.426
ISN'T HE DOING SO GREAT
WITH MAX?

02:01.460 --> 02:03.189
HE'S TEACHING HIM
BASKETBALL TRICKS.

02:03.220 --> 02:05.142
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
THEY'RE ENJOYING EACH OTHER.

02:05.190 --> 02:06.589
HADDIE'S REALLY HAPPY--
- HE'S IN MY CHAIR.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.564
- THAT'S NOT YOUR CHAIR,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

02:09.610 --> 02:11.498
HE'S BEEN PLAYING
WITH HIM ALL MORNING.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.325
I MEAN, THIS IS AMAZING.

02:12.370 --> 02:14.258
WHAT IF HE JOINS
A BASKETBALL TEAM?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.676
HE HASN'T SAID ONE WORD
ABOUT BUGS ALL MORNING.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.927
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN LET
OUT OF A REALLY BAD PRISON.

02:17.960 --> 02:21.259
- UM, HEY, IT'S OKAY
THAT ALEX IS HERE, RIGHT?

02:21.310 --> 02:23.198
- YEAH.
IT'S FINE.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.468
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.340
- UH, DO YOU HAVE
THAT BASKETBALL GAME TODAY?

02:26.380 --> 02:27.654
- YEAH, I DO.
WHY?

02:27.690 --> 02:30.488
- YOU COULD INVITE ALEX.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.408
- TO MY BASKETBALL GAME?

02:32.460 --> 02:33.836
- I MEAN--
- HONEY.

02:33.870 --> 02:35.497
- WHAT?
ANYBODY CAN PLAY, RIGHT?

02:35.530 --> 02:37.282
HE'S REALLY GOOD.
IT'LL BE FUN.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.188
AND YOU GUYS CAN, LIKE, GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

02:41.230 --> 02:43.778
- ADAM, YOU WANT TO TRY IT?
- UH, NO, I'M GOOD.

02:43.810 --> 02:46.631
- OKAY, I'M GONNA JUST SAY IT,
'CAUSE NOBODY ELSE IS.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.329
YOU KNOW, WHERE'S DREW?

02:48.370 --> 02:50.429
WHY DID WE LET DREW GO OUT
TO BREAKFAST WITH THAT GUY?

02:50.480 --> 02:52.198
- THAT GUY IS YOUR FATHER.
- WELL...

02:52.240 --> 02:53.684
- THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST.
YOU WEREN'T INVITED.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.517
- I DON'T WANT TO GO.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.279
WE'RE HERE BONDING
AS A FAMILY, YOU KNOW,

02:57.310 --> 02:58.231
AND HE'S NOT HERE.
- I'M SORRY.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.419
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER HEARD YOU

03:00.450 --> 03:02.202
TALK ABOUT
FAMILY-BONDING TIME.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.649
- ARE YOU GONNA MAKE FUN
OF ME NOW FOR IT?

03:03.700 --> 03:05.418
- NO, HONEY, I'M JUST SAYING--

03:06.770 --> 03:09.421
- HEY, EVERYBODY.
- HEY.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.804
- CAMILLE,
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU YET.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.353
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.436
- HEY, SETH.
THANKS FOR BRINGING HIM BACK.

03:20.470 --> 03:23.189

03:25.340 --> 03:27.649
HI, SWEETH EART.

03:27.690 --> 03:29.715
DREW TOLD ME HOW YOU
KICKED ASS THE OTHER NIGHT

03:29.760 --> 03:31.819
AT THAT SONGWRITING THING
AT THE OPEN MIC.

03:31.860 --> 03:33.475
- AMAZING.
- PLEASE, I WOULDN'T SAY

03:33.520 --> 03:35.488
THAT I, YOU KNOW, "KICKED ASS."
- IT WAS VERY GOOD.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.033
- EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE
WAS A BRAVERMAN.

03:37.070 --> 03:39.516
- THOSE ARE THE WORST PEOPLE
TO HAVE IN THE AUDIENCE.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.584
- THAT'S NOT EVEN TRUE.
- IT WAS PRETTY TRUE.

03:40.630 --> 03:42.860
- HEY, BRAVERMANS
ARE TOUGH CRITICS, TRUST ME.

03:42.910 --> 03:45.902
ANYWAY,
I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

03:45.940 --> 03:47.737
- WHAT?

03:47.770 --> 03:49.658
- IT'S JUST
AN OLD BEAT-AROUND GUITAR,

03:49.710 --> 03:51.393
BUT IT'S GOT
A GREAT SOUND.

03:51.430 --> 03:52.909
I PUT THESE REALLY
LIGHT STRINGS ON IT,

03:52.950 --> 03:54.918
SO YOU CAN PLAY ALL DAY,
DOESN'T HURT YOUR FINGERS.

03:54.950 --> 03:57.646
WRITES--WRITES GREAT SONGS,

03:57.680 --> 04:00.717

04:15.970 --> 04:17.483

04:18.770 --> 04:20.658

I'M SURE SHE'LL LOVE IT.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.565

04:33.100 --> 04:35.364
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

04:35.410 --> 04:38.504

TO THE STARS

04:38.550 --> 04:40.063
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

04:40.100 --> 04:42.068
AND MAY YOU STAY

04:42.100 --> 04:44.751
FOREVER YOUNG

04:44.800 --> 04:47.587
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

04:47.630 --> 04:49.939
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

04:49.970 --> 04:52.450
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

04:52.490 --> 04:54.936
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

04:54.980 --> 04:57.528
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE

05:18.040 --> 05:20.554
- YEAH.
WHY AREN'T YOU EATING?

05:20.590 --> 05:22.478
- IS THIS CHICKEN?

05:22.520 --> 05:24.454
- MM-HMM.
- IS CHICKEN MEAT?

05:24.490 --> 05:26.037
- MM, YES,
CHICKEN IS MEAT.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.354
- MM-HMM.

05:27.390 --> 05:30.974
- WELL, THEN I CAN'T EAT IT.

05:31.020 --> 05:32.772
- WHY?

05:32.810 --> 05:34.607
- I'M A VEGETARIAN.

05:37.570 --> 05:38.673
- UM...
- UM...

05:38.710 --> 05:40.769
BUT YOU'RE NOT A VEGETARIAN,

05:40.820 --> 05:41.889
BECAUSE YOU LOVE CHICKEN.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.717
- LOVE IT.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.162
- HUH.
- HONEY, UM...

05:46.200 --> 05:48.998
MEAT IS--UH, IT HAS A LOT
OF PROTEIN IN IT,

05:49.030 --> 05:51.828
AND HUMANS NEED PROTEIN,
AND YOU'RE HUMAN.

05:51.860 --> 05:53.828
- SWEETIE, WHERE'D YOU GET
THE IDEA TO BE A VEGETARIAN?

05:53.870 --> 05:55.440
- ELLA.
SHE'S A VEGETARIAN.

05:55.490 --> 05:57.697
HER WHOLE FAMILY
IS VEGETARIANS.

05:57.730 --> 06:01.518
I'M NOT GONNA EAT CHICKEN.
IT'S UNHEALTHY AND MEAN.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.549
- OKAY.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.875
WELL, BUG,

06:04.910 --> 06:07.470
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO EAT
YOUR CHICKEN, PLEASE.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.774
THANK YOU.
- UH-UH.

06:08.810 --> 06:12.052
NO WAY.

06:12.090 --> 06:14.194
- THIS IS A BAD SYSTEM.
- IT'S NOT BAD, MAX.

06:14.230 --> 06:16.573
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT.
- BUT WITH THIS,

06:16.610 --> 06:18.475
I HAVE TO DO MORE CHORES,

06:18.510 --> 06:19.738
AND EVEN IF I DO

I STILL EARN THE SAME AMOUNT
OF TV TIME.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.512

A GREAT LAWYER.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.165

OF TEN STICKERS OVER THE WEEK,

06:34.040 --> 06:35.519
YOU WILL GEE A BONUS...

06:35.560 --> 06:37.073
- HEY! COME IN.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.735
- THANKS.
- HOW ARE YOU?

06:38.770 --> 06:40.635
- I'M GOOD.

06:40.670 --> 06:43.730
COME ON, WE'RE JUST WORKING
ON MAX'S STICKER SYSTEM.

06:43.780 --> 06:45.748
- YOU HAVE TO GO OVER THAT
WITH YOUR MOM.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.429
- KRISTINA,
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

06:47.470 --> 06:49.882
I FEEL SO TERRIBLE FOR MISSING
MAX'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.535
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
JABBAR WAS SICK.

06:51.580 --> 06:53.434
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S SO NOT A BIG DEAL.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.129
- NO, HE WASN'T SICK.
- OH.

06:55.170 --> 06:57.855
- IT WAS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S GOING
ON BETWEEN ME AND CROSBY.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.095
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- WELL, WE HAD AN ARGUMENT,

07:00.140 --> 07:01.858
AND HE'S BEEN STAYING
ON THE BOAT.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.106
- I'M SORRY.
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:03.140 --> 07:04.721
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED,

07:04.760 --> 07:07.832
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S, LIKE, THESE HUGE ISSUES

07:07.870 --> 07:09.098
OR IF WE'RE JUST HAVING
COLD FEET.

07:09.150 --> 07:10.833
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
- GABY!

07:10.870 --> 07:13.907
[claps] WHY CAN'T
I DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU?

07:13.950 --> 07:16.521
- BECAUSE, MAX,
I'M NOT YOUR MOM.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.709

WELL--OKAY, FIRST OF ALL...

07:18.740 --> 07:19.843

YOU KNOW?

07:27.300 --> 07:28.858
YOU GUYS ARE HAVING A HICCUP.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

07:28.890 --> 07:32.781
I MEAN, IT'S--
IT SUCKS RIGHT NOW...

07:32.830 --> 07:34.718

08:33.090 --> 08:35.741

A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT THERE?

08:35.790 --> 08:37.166
- [laughs]
YEAH...

08:37.200 --> 08:41.261
IF I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT TAKEN
TO SCHOOL BY ALEX.

08:41.310 --> 08:42.754
[laughing]

08:44.590 --> 08:46.683
- SO YOU MOVED OUT, HUH?

08:46.730 --> 08:48.061
BACK ON THE HOUSEBOAT?

08:48.110 --> 08:50.078
- WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

08:50.110 --> 08:52.101
- JASMINE TALKED TO KRISTINA.

08:52.150 --> 08:54.311
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- JASMINE TOLD KRISTINA?

08:54.360 --> 08:57.636

08:58.950 --> 09:00.258
THROW AWAY THE VERY BEST THING

09:00.290 --> 09:01.700
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO YOU
IN YOUR LIFE

09:01.740 --> 09:03.150
BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE
SHE'S A LITTLE BIT

09:03.190 --> 09:04.771
CONTROLLING RIGHT NOW.
- MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE

09:04.820 --> 09:06.845
A LITTLE TIME-OUT
FROM YOUR JUDGMENT.

09:06.890 --> 09:08.642
- I AM NOT JUDGING YOU, CROSBY.
- YES, YOU ARE.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.261
- I AM LOOKING OUT FOR YOU--
- YES, YOU ARE JUDGING ME!

09:10.300 --> 09:11.927
- NO, I AM NOT JUDGING YOU!
- YOU ALWAYS JUDGE ME, MAN!

09:11.960 --> 09:14.190
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I'M THE IDIOT

09:14.240 --> 09:15.719
THAT'S ALWAYS SCREWING UP!

09:15.760 --> 09:17.239
I'M SORRY I'M NOT PERFECT
LIKE YOU, OKAY?

09:17.280 --> 09:18.850
IT MUST BE SO FRUSTRATING!

09:18.900 --> 09:20.868
- WOULD YOU KEEP YOUR VOICE
DOWN FOR A SECOND?

09:20.900 --> 09:21.969
- OH, YEAH, HEAVEN FORBID

09:22.000 --> 09:23.934
I SCREAM
ON THE BASKETBALL COURT!

09:23.970 --> 09:26.723
IS THAT A MISTAKE TOO?
- IT'S A PART OF GROWING UP.

09:26.770 --> 09:29.807
SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE?
- NO, I'M FAKE LEAVING.

09:35.850 --> 09:38.808
- HEY, AMBER.

09:38.850 --> 09:42.365
CAN YOU PLEASE STOP BEING
SO RUDE TO DAD?

09:42.400 --> 09:43.913
- WHOA.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.712
DON'T JUST COME IN HERE

09:45.750 --> 09:47.160
AND SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT TO ME.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.236
- WELL, IT'S TRUE. EVERY TIME
HE TRIES TO TALK TO YOU,

09:49.270 --> 09:50.828
YOU'RE SO RUDE TO HIM,

09:50.860 --> 09:52.168
YOU DON'T EVEN GIVE HIM
A CHANCE WHATSOEVER--

09:52.210 --> 09:53.757
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK IS RUDE?

09:53.800 --> 09:55.825
I THINK IT'S RUDE
TO LEAVE YOUR FAMILY.

09:55.870 --> 09:56.723
I THINK IT'S RUDE
TO DITCH THEM

09:56.760 --> 09:58.079
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO DEAL WITH IT

09:58.110 --> 09:59.657
AND THEN RUDE
TO COME BACK HERE

09:59.700 --> 10:00.837
AND JUST ACT LIKE
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

10:00.870 --> 10:02.349
- YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO YOUR OPINION, OKAY?

10:02.390 --> 10:04.278
- IT'S NOT AN OPINION.
IT'S WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.140
AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.283
HE LEFT US!
- I UNDERSTAND THAT!

10:08.330 --> 10:10.662
I GET IT!
BUT HE'S HERE RIGHT NOW.

10:10.710 --> 10:11.847
- THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU

10:11.880 --> 10:14.155
OVER AND OVER AGAIN--
- HE'S TRYING TO BE WITH US--

10:14.190 --> 10:15.703
- OH, HE'S REALLY TRYING,
ISN'T HE?

10:15.750 --> 10:16.842
HE'S TRYING
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.

10:16.890 --> 10:18.881
HE BROUGHT ME
THIS BEAUTIFUL GUITAR.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.854
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS GUITAR IS WORTH?

10:20.890 --> 10:22.755
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH!

10:22.790 --> 10:24.166
- 42 BIG ONES!
THAT'S HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH!

10:24.200 --> 10:26.134
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH WHATSOEVER!

10:26.170 --> 10:27.751
- YEAH, IT DOES,
BECAUSE I'M GONNA SELL IT

10:27.790 --> 10:29.178
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT IT!
- HE'S HAD THAT FOR 20 YEARS!

10:29.210 --> 10:31.132
- I DON'T CARE!
I DON'T WANT IT IN MY HOUSE!

10:31.180 --> 10:32.966
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT!
- PLEASE, PLEASE.

10:33.010 --> 10:35.342
JUST DON'T PUSH HIM AWAY.

10:38.940 --> 10:42.455
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO PUSH HIM AWAY, BUT...

10:42.500 --> 10:46.015
HE'S GONNA LEAVE.

10:46.050 --> 10:48.939
HE'S GONNA LEAVE AGAIN,
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.

10:48.990 --> 10:51.367
- I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

10:52.990 --> 10:55.857
[doorbell rings]

10:55.890 --> 10:56.879
- HEY!

11:05.590 --> 11:07.899
YOU NEED TO COME IN
AND SIT DOWN?

11:07.940 --> 11:09.692
- UM, I-I CAN'T REALLY
STAY LONG.

11:09.730 --> 11:12.767
I JUST...
GOD, THIS IS REALLY HARD.

11:12.810 --> 11:15.005
BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU GUYS
IN PERSON.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.463
SOMETHING HAS COME UP,
SOMETHING PERSONAL,

11:18.500 --> 11:21.219
AND, UM...

11:21.260 --> 11:24.889
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK

11:26.230 --> 11:28.790
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I KNOW IT'S REALLY SUDDEN.

11:28.820 --> 11:31.471
AND I MADE YOU GUYS

11:33.830 --> 11:35.024
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.447

11:37.480 --> 11:38.447
_ UH--

11:38.490 --> 11:39.889

11:39.940 --> 11:41.828

YES, IT IS.

11:41.870 --> 11:46.102
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

11:46.150 --> 11:48.243
I'M SORRY.

12:00.540 --> 12:04.237
[knock at door]

12:04.270 --> 12:05.476

- HEY, CROSBY,
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TALK

12:31.540 --> 12:33.053
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

12:33.090 --> 12:36.264
THE SILENCE THING
ISN'T DOING ANYONE ANY GOOD.

I'M MISSING CASH CAB.
- HONEY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

YOU CAN'T CASH IN
YOUR STICKERS

13:20.210 --> 13:21.416
UNTIL YOUR HOMEWORK

13:21.450 --> 13:23.202

THE HOMEWORK ON TIME.

13:23.250 --> 13:26.310
GABY ALWAYS DID.

13:26.350 --> 13:28.978

FOR 20 MINUTES, BY THE WAY.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.149
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS WORTH IT.
- IT IS WORTH IT!

13:39.190 --> 13:41.055
- I THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT
THAT IT'S NOT.

13:41.090 --> 13:42.364
- HOW CAN I FIND OUT
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TRUE?

13:42.400 --> 13:45.403
- CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR ONE--
- CROSBY, IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.919

13:56.310 --> 13:58.369
- YEAH. SHE GAVE NO NOTICE,
JUST SPLIT.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.273
- WHY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.005
SHE SAID PERSONAL REASONS.
- THREE...

14:02.040 --> 14:03.109
- NO!
- THAT'S IT.

14:03.150 --> 14:04.936
- YOU CANNOT DO THAT!
- I GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS.

14:04.980 --> 14:06.493

14:21.410 --> 14:23.298
- YOU QUIT?
- OH, CROSBY.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.570
- HOW COULD YOU QUIT?
- I WAS AT THE HOUSE.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.338
AND JASMINE CAME OVER,
AND IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

14:27.380 --> 14:29.098

SOMEONE ELSE, CROSBY.

14:37.390 --> 14:39.108
- OKAY, THEY'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ANYONE ELSE!

14:39.150 --> 14:40.356
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
AND SAY IT WAS A MISTAKE.

14:40.390 --> 14:41.493
- I CAN'T!

16:23.150 --> 16:24.663
I DON'T EAT MEAT ANYMORE.

17:15.580 --> 17:17.332
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO THE CHICKEN?

17:17.380 --> 17:20.167
- I HAVE TO GO TO WORK
IN A LITTLE, AND SO...

17:20.210 --> 17:21.689
I THOUGHT
I'D MAKE YOU GUYS DINNER.

17:21.730 --> 17:24.824
MOM AND DAD AREN'T HERE.
- IT DOESN'T LOOK THE SAME.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.440
- WELL, I MEAN, WHATEVER.
IT'S CHICKEN.

17:26.490 --> 17:29.243
I HAVE TO CHOP IT
ONE MORE TIME--WATCH THIS.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.248
[thud]
SEE? IT'S ALMOST OFF.

17:31.290 --> 17:32.279
- [chuckling]
- YEAH.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.833
- YOUR MOM
IS AN EXCELLENT COOK.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.142
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:35.190 --> 17:37.329
THEY CALL HER
SARAH BOYARDEE, RIGHT?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.157
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE A VERY, VERY BIG KNIFE.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.329
I'M TRYING SOMETHING--
TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW.

17:41.370 --> 17:43.634
- DO YOU MIND IF I...
GIVE YOU A HAND THERE?

17:43.680 --> 17:45.295
- OH, SPEAKING
OF EXCELLENT COOKS...

17:45.340 --> 17:47.149
- I KNOW MY WAY AROUND
A CHICKEN.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.407
SON, COME WATCH AND LEARN.
- SINCE WHEN?

17:49.440 --> 17:52.136
- I DEVELOPED AN INTEREST
IN A FEW THINGS, LIKE COOKING.

17:52.170 --> 17:53.649
- REALLY?
LOOK AT YOU,

17:53.690 --> 17:55.783
DEVELOPING INTERESTS
IN THINGS.

17:55.830 --> 17:57.479
- DO YOU GUYS WANT TO--

17:57.520 --> 17:58.794
- HI.
- HEY.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.309
- I'M MAKING DINNER,

18:00.350 --> 18:02.318
WHICH, YOU KNOW, WE COULD
REALLY USE YOUR HELP.

18:02.350 --> 18:04.386
DAD KNOWS HOW TO CUT
THE CHICKEN, ACTUALLY,

18:04.420 --> 18:07.309
BUT, UM, COME HELP.
- I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.282
- COME JOIN US
JUST FOR A MINUTE?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.708
- MM, NO.
THAT'S COOL.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.322
YOU JUST KEEP...
POKING THAT CHICKEN,

18:13.360 --> 18:14.566
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING.

18:14.610 --> 18:16.362
- HEY, UM, AMBER,

18:16.400 --> 18:18.880
DAD'S TAKING ME TO ALCATRAZ
ON FRIDAY.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.603
I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD COME.

18:20.650 --> 18:22.880
- OH, YEAH!
- I CAN'T, 'CAUSE--

18:22.920 --> 18:24.194
- COME ON, SWEETHEART.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.379
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE ALCATRAZ.

18:26.410 --> 18:28.753
- NO. YEAH. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:28.790 --> 18:32.169
MAYBE I WILL COME,
'CAUSE I LOVE IT.

18:32.210 --> 18:34.246
- HOW'S THE, UH...

18:34.280 --> 18:36.248
HOW'S THE GUITAR WORKING OUT?
- OH, THE GUITAR.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.349
YES, I MEANT TO TELL YOU.

18:37.390 --> 18:39.381
THE ONLY THING IS,
IS THAT IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD,

18:39.420 --> 18:40.864
UM, AND I DON'T WANT IT.

18:40.910 --> 18:43.310
SO IF YOU WANT IT,
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT BACK,

18:43.360 --> 18:45.214
OR I'M GONNA SELL IT, OKAY?
- AMBER...

18:45.260 --> 18:47.490
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RUDE.
- OH, AND THE OTHER THING IS...

18:47.540 --> 18:49.394
I ACTUALLY CAN'T GO
TO ALCATRAZ,

18:49.430 --> 18:51.432
BECAUSE I GET SICK ON BOATS,
WHICH, YOU KNOW,

18:51.470 --> 18:53.358
IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY
THAT KNOWS ME KNOWS.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.504
UM, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I JUST FORGET THAT

18:55.540 --> 18:58.338
IT'S BASICALLY
LIKE WE'RE STRANGERS, SO...

18:58.370 --> 18:59.814
- SWEETHEART,
I'M JUST TRYING TO--

18:59.860 --> 19:01.782
- STOP CALLING ME THAT.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.684
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.608
- AMBER--
- YOU CAN'T JUST WALTZ IN HERE

19:05.660 --> 19:08.174
AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND ACT LIKE
EVERYTHING IS FINE

19:08.210 --> 19:10.349
AND JUST, LIKE,
BUY US A BURGER

19:10.390 --> 19:12.176
AND, LIKE, GIVE ME
A CRAPPY GUITAR,

19:12.220 --> 19:13.482
AND EVERYTHING'S
JUST GONNA BE FINE AGAIN.

19:13.530 --> 19:15.839
YOU KNOW,
AND I GUESS IT WORKS.

19:15.870 --> 19:17.349
I GUESS IT WORKS
ON EVERYBODY BUT ME.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.255
I GUESS I'M THE ONLY PERSON
THAT, YOU KNOW,

19:19.290 --> 19:20.803
HAS A PROBLEM WITH IT,
BUT I'M SORRY,

19:20.840 --> 19:22.421
BUT I CAN'T FORGET THE FACT

19:22.470 --> 19:24.392
THAT YOU DIDN'T COME
TO MY BIRTHDAYS

19:24.430 --> 19:26.398
WHEN YOU PROMISED
THAT YOU WOULD!

19:26.440 --> 19:27.748
AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE ME OUT
ALL THE TIMES

19:27.780 --> 19:29.509
THAT YOU PROMISED
THAT YOU WOULD!

19:29.540 --> 19:33.306
AND YOU WERE NOT THERE FOR ME
WHEN I REALLY NEEDED YOU.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.376
AND SO I HAVE TROUBLE
BELIEVING THAT YOU'VE CHANGED,

19:35.410 --> 19:37.549
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD IT
ALL BEFORE.

19:37.590 --> 19:38.898
AND I'M SORRY,
BUT I LOOK AT YOU,

19:38.930 --> 19:42.582
AND I JUST SEE THE SAME LOSER
WHO LET ME DOWN.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.972
- LOOK, I'M SORRY, DAD.
SHE JUST GETS THAT WAY.

19:50.010 --> 19:53.946
SHE GOES OFF ON US
ALL THE TIME TOO, SO...

19:56.290 --> 19:58.565
- I SHOULDN'T BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

19:58.610 --> 20:01.363
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.369
- BUDDY, I'LL CALL YOU
ABOUT ALCATRAZ.

20:04.410 --> 20:05.434
- OKAY.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.436
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.441
[door closes]

20:15.490 --> 20:16.752
- LOOK, MOM, YOU--

20:16.800 --> 20:19.030
WHY DO YOU JUST SIT HERE
AND LET HER YELL AT HIM?

20:19.070 --> 20:20.958
YOU DIDN'T PROTECT HIM
WHATSOEVER!

20:21.010 --> 20:22.728
I MEAN, SHE WON'T EVEN
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

20:22.770 --> 20:25.000
HE'S TRYING!

20:38.960 --> 20:40.712
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
DO YOU?

20:40.750 --> 20:43.719
- NOT VERY MUCH.

20:43.750 --> 20:45.923
I'LL JUST HAVE DESSERT.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.860
- WELL, YOUNG LADY,

20:50.900 --> 20:54.028
YOUR GRANDMOTHER HAS NOW
PREPARED TWO DINNERS FOR YOU.

20:54.080 --> 20:58.005
- TRY A LITTLE MORE
OF THE SEITAN.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.860
- "SATAN"?

20:59.910 --> 21:00.979
- SEITAN.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.568
- OH.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.943
- NO, THANK YOU.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.563
- GRANDDAUGHTER,

21:08.610 --> 21:11.989
YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO EAT

21:12.020 --> 21:15.979
ONE OR THE OTHER...

21:16.030 --> 21:19.477
OR YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET UP
FROM THE TABLE.

21:37.390 --> 21:40.871
[plate clatters]

21:40.920 --> 21:42.467
[background chatter,
mellow rock music plays]

21:42.500 --> 21:44.468
- AHEM. THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.

21:52.890 --> 21:54.949
- HI.
- HEY.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.786
- ONE SEC.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.960
WANT A DRINK?
- YES. PITCHER OF GIN, PLEASE.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.695
- [chuckles sarcastically]

22:02.730 --> 22:04.834
- WELL...

22:04.870 --> 22:06.098
AMBER KICKED MY ASS.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.731
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU DESERVED IT.

22:07.770 --> 22:11.422
- SHE'S GOT YOUR GENES.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.837
LISTEN, I, UH...

22:13.880 --> 22:16.110
I GOT A CHANGE OF PLANS.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.367
THIS CLUB UP IN SEATTLE,

22:18.400 --> 22:20.777
THEY OFFERED US
A VERY SWEET DEAL ON A GIG,

22:20.820 --> 22:22.879
AND THE BAND WANTS TO TAKE IT.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.603
YES.

22:24.650 --> 22:26.436
ANYWAY, I GOT TO BACK-BURNER
THE WHOLE ALCATRAZ TRIP.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.754
- ALCATRAZ.

22:31.030 --> 22:35.558
MM-HMM. WELL...

22:35.590 --> 22:37.933
I'M SURE DREW
WILL UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW.

22:37.970 --> 22:40.723
MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD JUST HIT
THE BATTING CAGES AGAIN,

22:40.770 --> 22:41.976
YOU KNOW,
AND BEAT SOME PEOPLE UP,

22:42.010 --> 22:43.978
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?
- [laughs]

22:44.010 --> 22:46.422
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE
IN THE MORNING,

22:46.460 --> 22:48.018
'CAUSE WE WANT TO GET
AN EARLY START.

22:48.050 --> 22:50.189
- TOMORROW MORNING?

22:50.230 --> 22:51.561
- YEAH.

22:51.610 --> 22:56.013
SO COULD YOU...
TELL THE KIDS FOR ME?

23:02.860 --> 23:06.205
- SURE.
- THANK YOU.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.891
- EXCUSE ME, BARTENDER,
ANOTHER BEER?

23:08.930 --> 23:10.204
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
PRETTY BUSY, SO...

23:10.250 --> 23:13.458
UM, I HAD A GREAT TIME.

23:13.490 --> 23:15.720
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- MM-HMM.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.761
- YOU TAKE CARE.

23:19.950 --> 23:23.943
AND, UM--
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

23:23.980 --> 23:28.565
[glasses clattering loudly]

23:36.100 --> 23:38.785
[thunder rumbles]

23:40.000 --> 23:41.513
- HEY.

23:48.870 --> 23:52.806
I HAVE SPENT SO MUCH
OF MY LIFE BLAMING YOU, SETH.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.628
I HAVE BLAMED YOU
FOR THE FACT THAT...

23:56.670 --> 23:59.491
I'M ALMOST 40 YEARS OLD,
AND I STILL TEND BAR.

23:59.540 --> 24:01.019
AND I COULD EVEN TELL YOU
ALL THE REASONS

24:01.060 --> 24:03.847
AND EXPLAIN TO YOU
EXACTLY WHY IT'S YOUR FAULT.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.678
WHEN DREW
SITS UP IN HIS ROOM,

24:08.720 --> 24:10.859
DOESN'T SAY A WORD TO ME
FOR WEEKS,

24:10.890 --> 24:13.950
JUST HIDES AWAY,
I BLAME YOU.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.754
AND I SHOULDN'T.
I REALLY SHOULDN'T.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.722
IT DOES NO ONE ANY GOOD.

24:22.660 --> 24:25.766
BUT I CAN BLAME YOU
FOR GOING TO SEATTLE

24:25.800 --> 24:27.836
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR CHILDREN YOURSELF.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.040
I CAN BLAME YOU FOR THAT,
AND I WILL.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.947
I WILL BLAME YOU FOR YEARS.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.221
AND SADLY, PART OF ME
GETS OFF ON IT.

24:34.260 --> 24:36.672
I LOVE HAVING SOMETHING
TO BLAME YOU FOR,

24:36.710 --> 24:39.838
BECAUSE THEN
IT LETS ME OFF THE HOOK.

24:39.890 --> 24:43.053
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
LET OFF THE HOOK...

24:45.760 --> 24:47.614
NOT ANYMORE.

24:52.140 --> 24:54.586
SO YOU WILL BE THERE
TOMORROW MORNING

24:54.630 --> 24:55.767
BEFORE THEY GO TO SCHOOL

24:55.800 --> 24:57.768
TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR CHILDREN.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.904
YOU WILL BE THERE.

25:01.910 --> 25:04.765
THEY LEAVE AT 8:00.

25:06.950 --> 25:08.986
DON'T BE LATE.

25:26.760 --> 25:29.729
[soft piano notes playing]

25:45.160 --> 25:48.266
- IT'S REALLY HARD
FOR ME TO APOLOGIZE.

25:50.850 --> 25:54.923
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.
- YEAH, I DO...

25:57.650 --> 25:59.345
[piano note plays]

25:59.380 --> 26:01.792
- JASMINE,
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

26:01.830 --> 26:03.036
- I DID. I'M SORRY--

26:03.070 --> 26:04.697
- YOU DON'T OWE ME
AN APOLOGY, OKAY?

26:04.730 --> 26:05.936
I WAS SO STUPID.

26:05.970 --> 26:07.767
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY SORRY TO ME.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.803
- WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU WERE STUPID?

26:10.840 --> 26:12.319
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY--
WHAT DO YOU--

26:12.360 --> 26:14.828
WHY DO YOU--
- YOU KNOW, I BEEN DRINKING...

26:14.880 --> 26:16.154
[clears throat]
TONIGHT, SO I DON'T--

26:16.190 --> 26:19.057
THIS MIGHT NOT BE
THE BEST TIME FOR US TO...

26:21.060 --> 26:23.847
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION
RIGHT NOW.

26:23.890 --> 26:26.051
[clears throat]

26:26.100 --> 26:28.921
- HEY...

26:28.960 --> 26:30.928
CROSBY?

26:30.960 --> 26:32.962
LOOK AT ME.

26:35.420 --> 26:38.378
YOU CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME?

26:38.420 --> 26:40.934
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU WERE STUPID?

26:40.970 --> 26:42.244
WHAT DID YOU DO?

26:45.050 --> 26:46.768
- I MADE A MISTAKE.

26:48.430 --> 26:49.658
- WHAT KIND OF MISTAKE?

26:49.710 --> 26:52.019
- [sighs]
I DON'T KNOW.

26:52.050 --> 26:54.018
- YOU DON'T KNOW?

26:54.060 --> 26:56.881
DON'T LIE TO ME.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.024
- I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.

27:04.790 --> 27:07.020
IT WAS...

27:08.830 --> 27:10.206
STUPID, AND, UH, YOU KNOW,

27:10.240 --> 27:12.105
I DON'T...
[clears throat]

27:12.140 --> 27:13.721
HAVE AN EXCUSE OTHER THAN

27:13.770 --> 27:16.455
THIS HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE
GOING THROUGH OUR THING,

27:16.490 --> 27:18.867
AND I JUST KIND OF COLLAPSED
EMOTIONALLY,

27:18.910 --> 27:22.004
AND THE I DID THE WORST THING--
- WHO WAS IT?

27:22.050 --> 27:23.074
- IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.111
- IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.879
SO WHY DID YOU DO IT?

27:27.920 --> 27:30.252
- SWEETIE, LISTEN, 1--
IT WAS--IT WAS ONE TIME,

27:30.300 --> 27:32.814
AND IT WILL NEVER,
EVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

27:32.850 --> 27:36.297
I SWEAR, I WILL NEVER DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN, OKAY?

27:36.340 --> 27:37.989
I AM SO SORRY--

27:38.030 --> 27:39.440
- GET OFF OF ME.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.129
GET OFF OF ME.
- I JUST--I NEED TO KNOW

27:41.170 --> 27:42.444
THAT YOU'RE NOT--
HOLD ON. LISTEN--

27:42.480 --> 27:44.869
- GET OFF OF ME,
YOU ASSHOLE!

27:44.900 --> 27:46.299
THAT'S HOW YOU--

27:46.350 --> 27:48.386
- JASMINE--
- YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!

27:48.420 --> 27:50.103
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:50.150 --> 27:52.414
HEY, PLEASE DON'T WALK
OUT OF HERE.

27:52.460 --> 27:54.143
- NO! DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO!

27:54.180 --> 27:55.454
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:55.500 --> 27:57.946
YOU DON'T DESERVE ANYTHING
GOOD IN YOUR LIFE--

27:57.980 --> 27:59.709
NOTHING!

27:59.740 --> 28:01.469
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
FOR THIS.

28:24.150 --> 28:25.720
- HELLO.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.829
- HEY, HONEY, HOW YOU DOING?
- I'M WELL.

28:27.870 --> 28:30.009
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

28:30.050 --> 28:31.768
- GOOD. SO THANKS AGAIN
FOR WATCHING SYD.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.949
- NO PROBLEM. I TELL YOU,
THAT LITTLE GIRL IS A PIP.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.868
- YES, SHE IS.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.876
SO DID EVERYTHING GO OKAY?

28:37.920 --> 28:39.888
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

28:39.920 --> 28:42.912
- WHY?
SHE SAY SOMETHING?

28:42.960 --> 28:43.984
- YES.

28:44.030 --> 28:46.544
SHE MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED
SOMETHING

28:46.580 --> 28:48.821
ABOUT YOU TRIED TO FORCE HER
TO EAT MEAT?

28:48.860 --> 28:51.374
- OH, PLEASE. NO.
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT DOWN.

28:51.410 --> 28:54.038
- WELL, HOW DID IT GO DOWN?
- WELL, I TOLD HER

28:54.070 --> 28:55.173
SHE COULDN'T GET UP
FROM THE TABLE

28:55.210 --> 28:56.416
UNLESS HE HAD
SOMETHING TO EAT,

28:56.450 --> 28:57.963
AND I DIDN'T CARE
IF IT WAS LASAGNA

28:58.010 --> 28:59.932
OR THAT "SATAN" CRAPOLA.

28:59.970 --> 29:02.484
BUT RULES ARE RULES.

29:02.530 --> 29:03.906
- DAD, I HAVE TO SAY,

29:03.940 --> 29:05.874
I REALLY WISH
YOU HADN'T DONE THAT.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.252
- WELL, HONEY,
I GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW,

29:07.290 --> 29:09.258
SHE'S GOT TO LEARN
THAT THERE'S A SET OF RULES

29:09.290 --> 29:10.848
THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO FOLLOW.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.461
- WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO SQUELCH HER SPIRIT.

29:12.500 --> 29:16.266
SHE WANTS TO ATTEMPT
THIS VEGETARIANISM THING, AND--

29:16.300 --> 29:18.916
- COME ON, SWEETHEART,
SQUELCH HER SPIRIT?

29:18.960 --> 29:21.167
I MEAN, MY GOD,
SHE'S SIX YEARS OLD.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.168
YOU CAN'T LET HER RUN THE SHOW.
- OKAY, I JUST--

29:23.200 --> 29:25.509
I FEEL THAT WHEN YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

29:25.550 --> 29:27.029
IT UNDERMINES ME
AS A PARENT.

29:27.070 --> 29:29.209
- OH, JEEZ, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE--

29:29.250 --> 29:31.172
- HOLD ON.
JULIA...

29:31.210 --> 29:34.316
YOU KNOW, YOUR FATHER DOESN'T
ALWAYS MAKE THE BEST CHOICES,

29:34.350 --> 29:37.899
BUT HE DOES WHAT HE DOES
OUT OF LOVE.

29:37.940 --> 29:42.183
NO ONE IS TRYING TO SQUELCH
ANYONE'S SPIRIT.

29:42.220 --> 29:45.872
WE LOVE SYDNEY TO PIECES.
- I KNOW.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.319
- YOU KNOW THAT.
- YEAH.

29:47.370 --> 29:48.883
- BUT YOUR FATHER'S RIGHT.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.538
YOU CAN'T LET HER FEEL LIKE
SHE HAS ALL THE POWER.

29:52.580 --> 29:54.298
IT'S BACKWARDS.

29:54.340 --> 29:57.309
AND IT'S NOT DOING HER
ANY GOOD.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.368
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

30:01.420 --> 30:03.411
I KNOW THAT I CAN BE
OVERBEARING,

30:03.450 --> 30:05.930
AND I KEEP GOING OVER
IN MY HEAD

30:05.970 --> 30:07.483
HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE SECOND-GUESSED YOU

30:07.520 --> 30:08.908
ABOUT MAX'S CURRICULUM.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.316
AND I AM SO SORRY,
AND I'M WRONG.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.999
NO, NO, IT'S TRUE.
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I--

30:13.050 --> 30:14.836
- BECAUSE YOU LOVE MAX
SO MUCH.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.256
- YEAH.

30:16.290 --> 30:18.918
- AND I DO TOO.
I LOVE YOUR SON.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.157
I DO.

30:21.190 --> 30:24.057
- THEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE LEAVING.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.263
I MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT MOVING AWAY, RIGHT?

30:26.300 --> 30:28.336
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING
THIS BUSINESS.

30:28.370 --> 30:30.019
- NO.
- I MEAN,

30:30.060 --> 30:31.880
IF THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE, I--

30:31.930 --> 30:33.989
I CAN HELP YOU
FIGURE IT OUT, GABY,

30:34.030 --> 30:35.474
AND I'M HERE FOR YOU.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.067
IF YOU NEED TO TAKE A BREAK

30:37.110 --> 30:39.317
OR JUST TAKE
A LITTLE LEAVE OF ABSENCE...

30:39.350 --> 30:42.968
BUT IT'S JUST--
IT'S SO...

30:43.010 --> 30:45.001
[voice breaking]
YOU'VE HELPED MY SON SO MUCH,

30:45.050 --> 30:46.904
AND I'M...

30:46.940 --> 30:50.285
I'M AT A LOSS.

30:53.950 --> 30:56.054
- I DIDN'T LEAVE
BECAUSE OF YOU OR MAX,

30:56.090 --> 30:57.432
WHO I DO LOVE.

30:57.470 --> 31:00.121
- THEN WHY?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE? I'M--

31:04.270 --> 31:05.612
IT'S OKAY.

31:05.650 --> 31:07.515
- MM.

31:07.550 --> 31:10.997
UM...

31:11.040 --> 31:14.203
I-I LEFT...

31:14.250 --> 31:18.004
THE BIRTHDAY PARTY
THE OTHER NIGHT WITH CROSBY

31:18.040 --> 31:20.452
AND IT...

31:20.490 --> 31:23.050
IT GOT COMPLICATED.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.318
- CROS--

31:32.400 --> 31:34.641
COMPLICATED, OH.
- I'M SO SORRY.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.672
I'M SO SORRY.
- HMM.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.547
- WE GOT A COUPLE DATES
IN THE MIDWEST

31:41.580 --> 31:44.231
IN WYOMING AND MONTANA.

31:44.280 --> 31:46.032
IT'S TURNING INTO, LIKE,
A LITTLE MINI TOUR.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.446
- THAT SOUNDS COOL.

31:47.490 --> 31:49.936
- WELL...

31:49.970 --> 31:51.585
NEXT TIME I'M IN TOWN?

31:51.630 --> 31:53.666
- OF COURSE.
- I MEAN, 'CAUSE WE WERE

31:53.700 --> 31:55.042
GONNA DO THE ALCATRAZ
THING AND...

31:55.080 --> 31:57.048
- I KNOW.
- OKAY.

32:00.430 --> 32:03.399
IT WAS FIANTASTIC.

32:03.430 --> 32:07.389
I HAD THE BEST TIME.
- ME TOO.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.408
- YOU'RE A GREAT YOUNG MAN.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.647
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU, SON.

32:25.590 --> 32:28.525
AND, AMBER, I--
- LOOK, I...

32:28.560 --> 32:30.380
JUST, LIKE, ABOUT
WHAT I SAID, YOU KNOW,

32:30.430 --> 32:33.706
I WASN'T TRYING TO--
- NO. EVERYTHING YOU SAID...

32:33.740 --> 32:36.595
WAS TRUE.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.631
YOU GOT EVERY RIGHT
TO SAY THAT.

32:40.680 --> 32:43.535
AND I'M SORRY.

32:43.580 --> 32:46.469
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

32:46.510 --> 32:48.432
AND MAYBE ONE DAY
I'LL BE LUCKY ENOUGH

32:48.480 --> 32:50.994
TO HEAR
YOUR BEAUTIFUL VOICE.

32:51.030 --> 32:53.442
- GUESS WE'LL SEE, RIGHT?

33:00.800 --> 33:02.347
- DON'T FORGET
THE LIGHT-GAUGE STRINGS

33:02.390 --> 33:05.769
ON THE GUITAR, THE TENS,
'CAUSE...

33:05.810 --> 33:09.109
YOU CAN PLAY ALL NIGHT.

33:10.470 --> 33:13.598
- HEAR

33:13.640 --> 33:17.269
HEAR THE NOISE
THAT MOVES SO SOFT

33:17.300 --> 33:19.712
AND SLOW

33:19.750 --> 33:22.025
THAT'S THE SOUND

33:22.060 --> 33:25.097
OF FRESHLY FALLEN SNOW

33:25.140 --> 33:28.780
YOUR LOVE IS GOLD

33:28.830 --> 33:31.242
YOUR LOVE IS GOLD

33:35.560 --> 33:38.597
IT SEEMS...

33:38.630 --> 33:41.076
- SO HOW WAS IT?

33:41.120 --> 33:43.395
- IT WAS GOOD.
THANK YOU.

33:45.780 --> 33:48.533
- TO BANG UPON
THESE DRUMS THAT WE HAVE

33:48.570 --> 33:52.290
- I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU
ALL LAST NIGHT.

33:52.340 --> 33:55.059
ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU
HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO DO

33:55.100 --> 33:58.160
OR...
THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE YET,

33:58.200 --> 34:00.475
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER,

34:00.520 --> 34:03.546
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE TALENT.

34:03.590 --> 34:06.104
[sighs]
YOU'RE LIKE MAGIC.

34:06.140 --> 34:10.076
AND I REMEMBER ALL THOSE SONGS
THAT WE WROTE TOGETHER.

34:11.840 --> 34:16.595
THEY'RE MY BEST ONES.

34:16.640 --> 34:20.565
YEP, 'CAUSE THEY'RE
THE DEEPEST.

34:20.610 --> 34:23.841
I'M JUST--
I'M JUST A GUITAR PLAYER.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.745
YOU'RE THE ARTIST.

34:25.780 --> 34:29.784
SO DON'T--DON'T LET YOURSELF
GET IN THE WAY OF THAT, OKAY?

34:33.550 --> 34:34.778
- OKAY.

34:37.280 --> 34:40.727
I'M GLAD YOU CAME.
- THANKS.

34:44.730 --> 34:46.243
OUR KIDS ARE BEAUTIFUL.

34:46.290 --> 34:48.076
- MM-HMM.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.629
- AND THAT'S ALL YOU.

34:52.670 --> 34:54.774
YOU DID ALL THAT.

34:54.810 --> 34:58.564
I MEAN,
YOU TOOK ON THAT BURDEN.

35:00.680 --> 35:03.672
- IT'S NOT ALWAYS A BURDEN.
SOMETIMES IT'S...

35:03.720 --> 35:06.268
MORE LIKE A PRIVILEGE.

35:06.310 --> 35:10.656
- FROM THE INSIDE
OF MY MOUTH

35:10.690 --> 35:14.581
AND THE SLOW
MIGRATION SOUTH

HEY, YOU OKAY?

37:40.630 --> 37:42.313

DIDN'T HAVE TO YELL AT HIM
OR SAY THOSE THINGS,

38:22.020 --> 38:24.056
AND I KNOW THAT IT WAS
IMPORTANT TO YOU

38:24.090 --> 38:26.638
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIM, AND...

38:26.680 --> 38:29.717
YOU TRIED TO TALK TO ME,
AND I DIDN'T LISTEN.

38:29.750 --> 38:32.401
AND I'M SORRY.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.612

38:39.660 --> 38:41.378
IF HE WAS A REAL DAD,

38:41.420 --> 38:45.106
NOTHING YOU DID
COULD HAVE MADE HIM LEAVE.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.971
I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

38:57.950 --> 39:01.886

- HE HAD A CONNECTION WITH GABY.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.774
IT'S THE SAME CONNECTION
YOU HAVE WITH EVERY WOMAN.

41:46.810 --> 41:49.017
IT'S JUST SEX!
- NUMBER ONE, YOU'RE WRONG.

41:49.050 --> 41:51.189
NUMBER TWO, I KNOW
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT LOSING

41:51.230 --> 41:53.607
YOUR BABYSITTER,
BUT I LOST MY FIANCEE, OKAY?

41:53.640 --> 41:55.983
AND I MAY HAVE LOST MY SON,
SO I DIDN'T COME OUT UNSCATHED!

41:56.030 --> 41:57.292
- SHE WASN'T OUR BABYSITTER.
- WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND

41:57.340 --> 41:58.671
ABOUT THIS--
SHE'S NOT A BABYSITTER!

41:58.720 --> 42:00.779
SHE'S A BEHAVIORAL AIDE
FOR YOUR NEPHEW!

42:00.820 --> 42:03.300
HE'S GOT ASPERGER'S!
WHAT DON'T YOU GET ABOUT THAT?

42:03.340 --> 42:06.616
GET IT IN YOUR THICK SKULL
YOUR NEPHEW HAS ASPERGER'S!

42:08.140 --> 42:09.516
- I HAVE ASPERGER'S?

42:16.050 --> 42:19.634
WHAT IS ASPERGER'S?
