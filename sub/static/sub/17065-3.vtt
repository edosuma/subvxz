WEBVTT

00:03.890 --> 00:06.057
<i>Ugh. There are Raisinets in here.</i>

00:06.143 --> 00:08.710
<i>Why put health food in
a perfectly good bag of candy?</i>

00:08.779 --> 00:10.578
Hey, hon.

00:10.647 --> 00:12.180
Oh, no.

00:12.249 --> 00:14.554
Did someone buy the Halloween
candy too early again this year?

00:14.651 --> 00:16.851
No. Yes. Maybe.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.720
Yes.

00:18.788 --> 00:19.788
Yeah.

00:21.358 --> 00:23.558
Here. Hide this.

00:23.627 --> 00:26.361
No, wait. Okay.

00:26.429 --> 00:28.897
Hide it someplace where
if I really, really want it,

00:28.965 --> 00:29.764
I can find it.

00:29.833 --> 00:30.932
But not someplace where

00:31.001 --> 00:32.232
if I just accidentally stumble upon it,

00:32.302 --> 00:34.402
I go, "Hey, candy!"

00:34.471 --> 00:36.137
You're always giving me instructions

00:36.206 --> 00:37.505
I don't know how to execute.

00:37.574 --> 00:39.174
Mm-hmm. I know.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.846
No. Mnh-mnh.

00:46.716 --> 00:48.783
I know where that is.

00:54.824 --> 00:56.491
Hey, hon, did you see this?

00:56.560 --> 00:57.859
"In honor of Halloween,

00:57.928 --> 01:00.862
Westport is hosting
a 5K zombie obstacle course."

01:00.931 --> 01:03.298
You can sign up
to be a zombie or a runner.

01:03.366 --> 01:05.132
This town is unbelievable.

01:05.202 --> 01:08.369
They take a holiday which is
very specifically about candy,

01:08.438 --> 01:09.971
and make it about exercise.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.206
It's just not right.

01:11.274 --> 01:12.740
I signed up to be a zombie.

01:12.809 --> 01:14.576
Oh, come on, man.

01:14.644 --> 01:15.777
Sounds like fun.

01:15.845 --> 01:16.911
Runners have to get past obstacles

01:16.980 --> 01:18.179
while dodging zombies.

01:18.248 --> 01:19.147
Do it with me.

01:19.216 --> 01:20.381
Hmm.

01:20.450 --> 01:21.849
Sometimes you say things

01:21.918 --> 01:24.018
that make me feel
like we have never met.

01:25.188 --> 01:26.588
I want to be a zombie, too!

01:26.656 --> 01:27.956
What's a zombie?

01:28.024 --> 01:29.691
A zombie is a corpse
that's come back to life

01:29.759 --> 01:31.392
and feeds primarily on human brains.

01:31.461 --> 01:32.694
Okay. I'm in.

01:32.762 --> 01:34.028
All right, then.

01:34.698 --> 01:36.197
Hey, Oliver, you want
to do some zombie-ing

01:36.266 --> 01:37.665
with me and Anna-Kat this weekend?

01:37.734 --> 01:39.801
Halloween is a celebration of handouts

01:39.869 --> 01:42.537
and encourages a welfare-state
mentality in our kids.

01:42.606 --> 01:44.939
And you don't like Halloween
because you freak out.

01:50.714 --> 01:53.014
You peed on Daddy's neck!

01:53.083 --> 01:54.549
Yeah, it went down my back, too.

01:54.618 --> 01:56.251
Remember how powerful
his urine used to be?

01:56.319 --> 01:57.785
He was like a male cat.

01:57.854 --> 01:59.387
- I was marked.
- Yeah.

01:59.456 --> 02:01.956
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Taylor.

02:02.025 --> 02:03.925
And Viv.

02:03.994 --> 02:04.994
Hey, Viv.

02:05.028 --> 02:06.327
Bonsoir, Ottos.

02:06.396 --> 02:07.729
Taylor, I thought you said

02:07.797 --> 02:09.864
you were giving tennis lessons
to a friend.

02:09.933 --> 02:10.632
I was.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.333
Friend, neighbor,

02:12.402 --> 02:14.802
Weight Watchers success story, hello.

02:14.871 --> 02:17.138
So, are all your houses this cozy?

02:17.207 --> 02:18.406
- Just the one.
- Oh.

02:18.475 --> 02:20.174
Why are you guys dressed alike?

02:20.243 --> 02:21.676
Viv gave me some of her hand-me-downs.

02:21.737 --> 02:24.838
Taylor and I are the same size.
Isn't that funny?

02:24.914 --> 02:27.415
So funny. All I do is laugh
at how skinny you are.

02:31.554 --> 02:32.954
- Pier 1!
- Mm-hmm.

02:33.023 --> 02:36.457
How cute. That reminds me
of my old dorm room at Vassar.

02:36.526 --> 02:38.559
- Oh, you got to apply.
- I will.

02:38.628 --> 02:41.396
Okay, let me give you more memories.

02:41.464 --> 02:43.498
Target, Target, Walmart.

02:43.566 --> 02:44.899
That was here when we moved in.

02:44.968 --> 02:47.735
Costco, CVS, and see ya later.

02:48.972 --> 02:50.872
- Bye, Viv.
- Bye-bye.

02:51.975 --> 02:55.877
Hey, kind of an older addition
to your squad, huh?

02:55.945 --> 02:57.679
Viv and I have a lot in common.

02:57.747 --> 02:58.880
What do you have in common,

02:58.948 --> 03:00.715
other than never having paid
for your own dinner?

03:00.784 --> 03:04.218
She's athletic, fun, super-positive.

03:04.287 --> 03:05.420
- Mm.
- You know what it is?

03:05.488 --> 03:06.321
Hmm?

03:06.389 --> 03:07.522
She gets me.

03:09.492 --> 03:11.025
Okay. Asked and answered.

03:13.663 --> 03:15.063
"She gets me."

03:15.131 --> 03:16.064
Do you see what's happening here?

03:16.132 --> 03:17.865
You know I don't.

03:17.934 --> 03:20.601
Taylor is looking up to Viv and not me.

03:20.670 --> 03:22.770
That woman is turning her
into a mini-version

03:22.839 --> 03:24.238
of her fakey-fake-fake self.

03:24.307 --> 03:26.307
Or maybe Viv's just being nice.

03:27.577 --> 03:29.143
Really, Greg?

03:29.212 --> 03:30.745
The freezer?

03:30.814 --> 03:34.082
I asked you to hide the candy,
not make it more delicious.

03:34.150 --> 03:35.717
Right.

03:39.956 --> 03:41.956
"Being nice"? Please.

03:42.025 --> 03:43.545
Greg's the one who's nice... too nice.

03:43.593 --> 03:45.093
And, sweetie, sometimes a little stupid.

03:45.161 --> 03:47.830
Yeah, and why does he always have
bread in his car to feed the birds?

03:47.864 --> 03:49.597
- It's weird, right?
- It's real weird.

03:49.666 --> 03:51.532
So, I'm not being crazy
about this Viv thing?

03:51.601 --> 03:52.967
So not crazy.

03:53.036 --> 03:55.670
You need to stop this
relationship in its tracks.

03:55.739 --> 03:58.639
You want me to introduce her
to North and South Korea?

04:00.143 --> 04:01.976
Now, that's the reaction
I was looking for.

04:02.045 --> 04:03.444
I can always count on you guys

04:03.513 --> 04:05.947
for clear, irrational, angry opinions.

04:06.015 --> 04:07.815
Listen, I know horrible women.

04:07.884 --> 04:09.817
I married one, I cheated with one,

04:09.886 --> 04:11.319
and I think I am one.

04:11.388 --> 04:12.487
So, what's my plan for Viv?

04:12.555 --> 04:13.721
Call her on her crap!

04:13.790 --> 04:15.523
Mnh-mnh. Viv is sneaky. She'll deny it.

04:15.592 --> 04:16.991
But at least she'll know
you're onto her,

04:17.060 --> 04:19.494
and nobody wants Katie Otto
all over them.

04:19.562 --> 04:20.762
Mm. Except me.

04:20.829 --> 04:22.797
When we first met,
I did have a little crush.

04:22.866 --> 04:23.765
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

04:23.833 --> 04:24.932
That's sweet.

04:25.001 --> 04:27.368
I'd be into those, but not that.

04:27.437 --> 04:28.569
Okay.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:38.948 --> 04:40.615
Hey, Viv?

04:40.683 --> 04:42.583
Just a sec.

04:42.652 --> 04:43.652
I gotta...

04:43.720 --> 04:44.919
Just excuse me!

04:44.988 --> 04:47.121
Just quick talk.

04:47.190 --> 04:48.489
Can you hear me?

04:48.558 --> 04:49.724
Gotta talk to you.

04:49.793 --> 04:50.925
Excuse...

04:50.994 --> 04:52.093
Gotta...

04:52.162 --> 04:52.960
Viv...

04:53.029 --> 04:53.895
Right here.

04:53.963 --> 04:54.963
Lookin' at ya.

04:55.031 --> 04:56.564
We can't talk. Okay.

04:56.633 --> 04:57.999
Gonna get the machine.

05:02.772 --> 05:04.739
Oh.

05:04.808 --> 05:06.107
Okay.

05:06.176 --> 05:07.508
Aah!

05:12.816 --> 05:15.683
Oh. Oh, my.

05:15.752 --> 05:17.885
You're so funny. Just leave it.

05:17.954 --> 05:20.788
You remind me of me when I was big...

05:20.857 --> 05:23.658
so jolly, unable to control your body.

05:23.726 --> 05:26.761
<i>I didn't know everything I
hated could fit into a size 0.</i>

05:26.830 --> 05:29.130
Listen, I know you have been spending

05:29.199 --> 05:30.331
a lot of time with Taylor.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.433
Oh, I love her.
She's so different than you.

05:32.502 --> 05:34.101
- Mm-hmm.
- It's like the apple fell off of your tree

05:34.170 --> 05:35.570
and just rolled right over to mine.

05:35.638 --> 05:36.771
- Right?
- Yeah.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.372
But just to be clear, she's my apple.

05:38.441 --> 05:40.007
Of course. I'm not trying to be her mom,

05:40.076 --> 05:41.209
just a super-cool neighbor.

05:41.277 --> 05:43.177
Tay's words, not mine.

05:43.246 --> 05:46.247
<i>"Tay"? I wonder what happens
to Botox if you punch it.</i>

05:46.316 --> 05:49.116
Can you believe
Andrew Hartsfield texted her?

05:49.185 --> 05:51.519
I love that she can talk to us
about that stuff.

05:51.588 --> 05:53.855
You should hear
what she talks to just me about.

05:53.923 --> 05:55.356
Ooh!

05:55.425 --> 05:57.091
<i>Who the hell is Andrew Hartsfield?</i>

05:57.160 --> 05:59.527
<i>I hope he's not that weirdo
at the gas station.</i>

05:59.596 --> 06:01.996
Hey, did she tell you we're
doing the zombie run together?

06:03.032 --> 06:04.165
Of course, she did.

06:04.234 --> 06:06.501
I'm doing it, too.

06:06.569 --> 06:09.237
How exciting!
I didn't know you were a runner.

06:09.305 --> 06:10.605
I am so proud of you.

06:10.673 --> 06:12.306
Well, I don't run
for your approval, Viv.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.941
Yay. I love it!

06:14.010 --> 06:15.977
That's not something to love, Viv.

06:16.045 --> 06:17.211
That, I love.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.614
Viv, are we in
the same conversation right now?

06:19.682 --> 06:21.202
I'm telling you I'm going to beat you.

06:21.251 --> 06:22.550
I love it!

06:22.619 --> 06:23.619
All right.

06:23.686 --> 06:25.052
Hey! We should play sometime.

06:25.121 --> 06:26.921
- Never gonna happen!
- Bye!

06:33.637 --> 06:36.404
Was it a bit impulsive of me
to say I could beat Viv?

06:36.473 --> 06:38.103
Yes, it was, but, remember,

06:38.181 --> 06:39.808
I was the fastest girl in sixth grade.

06:39.876 --> 06:41.910
Yes, many, many years ago.

06:41.978 --> 06:44.145
Hey, winning is 51% mental.

06:44.214 --> 06:46.314
And 49% running.

06:46.383 --> 06:48.650
Honey, why can't you just accept
that Taylor's at the age

06:48.718 --> 06:50.078
where she pushes her parents away?

06:50.120 --> 06:52.720
Yes, but she could push me away
for boys or drugs,

06:52.789 --> 06:54.422
but not Viv.

06:54.491 --> 06:56.458
Is being crazy part
of your mental preparation?

06:56.526 --> 06:57.992
They're becoming best friends.

06:58.061 --> 06:59.327
I should be her best friend.

06:59.396 --> 07:00.428
And they're texting!

07:00.497 --> 07:02.130
I want her to text me,

07:02.199 --> 07:04.299
not some aggressively annoying
Westport-y woman.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.401
You know what?
I'm gonna text her right now.

07:07.471 --> 07:08.636
"Hi."

07:10.307 --> 07:11.806
That's a terrible text.

07:11.875 --> 07:12.707
Yeah.

07:12.776 --> 07:14.309
Are you texting me?

07:14.377 --> 07:17.879
Wanted to let you know
I'm doing the Fun Run.

07:17.948 --> 07:19.214
Why?

07:19.282 --> 07:21.649
Can't a mom do a fun run
with her daughter?

07:21.718 --> 07:23.798
You always say running
is for criminals and showoffs.

07:23.854 --> 07:24.986
Maybe I want to show off.

07:25.722 --> 07:27.722
Who do you think you got
your athleticism from... him?

07:27.791 --> 07:29.090
Hey, Greg, catch.

07:31.127 --> 07:33.628
You know about my sloped eye.
I have no depth perception.

07:33.697 --> 07:35.163
I'm gonna go now.

07:36.666 --> 07:37.599
Bye, Tay-Tay.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.367
Don't call me that!

07:39.436 --> 07:40.436
That was tough to watch.

07:46.243 --> 07:48.409
I want to be a zombie from the Titanic,

07:48.478 --> 07:51.546
so I need to look like I froze
during the prime of my life.

07:51.615 --> 07:53.081
Specificity... I like it.

07:53.149 --> 07:55.149
I'm going more old-school zombie...

07:55.218 --> 07:56.518
tattered clothes, leg drag.

07:56.586 --> 07:57.952
Oliver, last chance to join.

07:58.021 --> 07:59.787
Honestly, Dad, the only reason I'm here

07:59.856 --> 08:03.024
is because I wanted to see how
seasonal businesses stay afloat.

08:03.093 --> 08:06.427
Daddy, this could work for my
Catherine Nellie Johnston zombie

08:06.496 --> 08:09.097
who met her icy death
at the tender age of seven.

08:09.165 --> 08:10.665
Dork.

08:10.734 --> 08:12.567
At least I don't pee on my own dad.

08:12.636 --> 08:14.135
No, you pee in the yard.

08:14.204 --> 08:16.271
- I...
- Guys, everyone could pee better.

08:16.339 --> 08:18.373
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

08:18.441 --> 08:19.908
Well, who's that there?

08:19.976 --> 08:21.075
Alice McCarthy.

08:21.144 --> 08:23.411
She's like the queen of Oliver's class.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.380
Every boy wants to kiss her lips.

08:25.448 --> 08:26.514
Whatever.

08:26.583 --> 08:27.916
Well, get her attention, do something...

08:27.984 --> 08:29.717
double-thumbs up, finger guns.

08:29.786 --> 08:31.085
Go on, go on.

08:34.157 --> 08:35.256
Oh, what's up, Alice?

08:35.325 --> 08:36.591
Hey.

08:36.659 --> 08:38.559
I've got my eye on you.

08:38.628 --> 08:40.094
Nice. Using your environment.

08:40.163 --> 08:41.195
- Smart.
- Yeah.

08:41.264 --> 08:43.565
I'm looking for something to wear

08:43.633 --> 08:44.633
for the Fun Run tomorrow.

08:44.668 --> 08:47.402
Cool. Cool. Me too.

08:47.470 --> 08:48.503
Cool.

08:50.507 --> 08:53.474
Ooh! Yeah, that's pretty much
what I expected.

08:54.978 --> 08:57.645
And then the toy skeleton lunged at him,

08:57.714 --> 08:59.614
and he screamed

08:59.683 --> 09:02.183
like when Dad had to play
in that basketball game.

09:02.252 --> 09:03.384
Yeah, well...

09:03.453 --> 09:04.619
Alice thinks I'm a wuss.

09:04.688 --> 09:05.954
It's no big deal, Oliver.

09:06.022 --> 09:07.989
You're a sensitive guy.
It's in the Otto blood.

09:08.058 --> 09:09.657
It doesn't make you any less of a man.

09:09.726 --> 09:11.693
You can change her mind. I promise you.

09:11.761 --> 09:14.028
When I first met your dad,
I thought he was a wuss, too.

09:14.097 --> 09:17.999
He was my college T.A.,
and he carried a purse to class.

09:18.068 --> 09:19.367
It was a satchel.

09:19.436 --> 09:21.302
The point is, now Mama loves me.

09:21.371 --> 09:24.205
You know what? You should get in the
race, maybe battle some zombies.

09:24.274 --> 09:25.473
Show her you're not a wuss.

09:25.542 --> 09:29.110
Tonight, in the tradition
of pre-race meals,

09:29.179 --> 09:30.411
we carbo-load.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.579
How is this different

09:31.648 --> 09:33.748
from our regular Saturday night noodles?

09:33.817 --> 09:35.016
We're gonna eat more of it,

09:35.085 --> 09:36.485
and no side salad that nobody eats,

09:36.553 --> 09:38.686
and I throw away
feeling like a bad mommy.

09:38.755 --> 09:40.655
Taylor! Dinner!

09:40.724 --> 09:42.123
She's across the street at Viv's.

09:43.393 --> 09:45.026
Oh, well, why don't I just go ahead

09:45.095 --> 09:47.562
and run right over and get her?

09:47.631 --> 09:49.163
Roadie!

09:51.301 --> 09:52.400
It was a satchel.

09:52.469 --> 09:53.901
Okay, Daddy.

09:53.970 --> 09:55.370
Wow, is she actually running?

09:55.438 --> 09:56.771
We can eat.

10:01.811 --> 10:04.145
Mom, what are you doing here?

10:05.281 --> 10:06.714
I...

10:06.783 --> 10:08.249
just came to get my...

10:08.318 --> 10:09.017
girl for dinner.

10:09.085 --> 10:10.785
We're carbo-loading.

10:10.854 --> 10:13.287
Whoo! Let's get it! All right!

10:13.356 --> 10:15.223
She's been training
for the Fun Run all week.

10:15.291 --> 10:16.724
What the hell?!

10:20.196 --> 10:21.963
Winners win!

10:22.032 --> 10:23.097
Drop it!

10:23.166 --> 10:24.265
I'm a ninja!

10:24.334 --> 10:25.500
Ninja! Ninja!

10:25.568 --> 10:27.068
Holy Fudruckers!

10:28.371 --> 10:29.303
Whoo!

10:29.372 --> 10:30.405
Hey, Katie.

10:30.473 --> 10:31.706
Whoo!

10:31.775 --> 10:33.274
Way to go, Viv!

10:33.343 --> 10:35.810
- One, two...
- Isn't she amazing?

10:35.879 --> 10:38.479
<i>No, the woman who let the doctor
go elbow deep inside her</i>

10:38.548 --> 10:41.249
<i>to flip you around... she's amazing.</i>

10:41.317 --> 10:43.217
Feel it! Let's go deep!

10:43.286 --> 10:45.420
<i>Ugh! I can't lose my daughter to Viv.</i>

10:45.488 --> 10:48.356
<i>I gotta hunker down
and do what I do best...</i>

10:48.425 --> 10:49.957
<i>cheat.</i>

10:57.107 --> 10:58.317
Here are your flags.

10:58.387 --> 11:00.887
Once the zombies
take all three, you're done.

11:00.955 --> 11:03.288
Thank you... sexy cat.

11:03.357 --> 11:04.456
Meow.

11:04.525 --> 11:06.158
Ugh.

11:07.194 --> 11:09.728
Okay, what's scarier... this...

11:09.797 --> 11:11.872
or this...?

11:11.966 --> 11:14.700
Um, the first one. But what about this?

11:17.271 --> 11:18.737
You sound like a boiling lobster.

11:18.806 --> 11:20.973
Meeting its torturous, watery death,

11:21.042 --> 11:23.008
like Mary Smith's husband, Lucian,

11:23.077 --> 11:25.511
who would never see
his unborn child alive.

11:27.815 --> 11:29.415
Strapped in and ready to win.

11:29.483 --> 11:32.284
Are these what you're after?
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh?

11:32.353 --> 11:34.353
If I were a human,
I'd find you so sexy right now.

11:40.761 --> 11:41.827
Is that her?

11:41.896 --> 11:43.662
Oliver, I don't care
what anyone else says,

11:43.731 --> 11:44.963
she's not out of your league.

11:45.032 --> 11:46.332
No one has said that.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.811
Runners, take your mark
at the starting line!

11:48.905 --> 11:50.608
Zombies, stake your claim in the field.

11:50.718 --> 11:51.904
Okay. I guess this is it.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.105
Good luck, baby.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.641
Let's just take that elsewhere.

11:55.710 --> 11:56.842
- You.
- Huh?

11:56.911 --> 11:59.411
Forget all the other runners.
Just kill Viv.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.647
Steal her flags
and knock her out of the race.

12:01.716 --> 12:03.382
Katie, the Zombie Fun Run
Rules of Conduct waiver

12:03.451 --> 12:04.750
may not mean anything to you,

12:04.819 --> 12:06.219
but it still means something to me.

12:13.694 --> 12:16.595
You're being insane.
I don't know why, but you are.

12:16.664 --> 12:18.364
Winning isn't insane.

12:18.432 --> 12:19.732
It's so insane.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.100
Are you dehydrated or something?

12:21.168 --> 12:22.501
Katie, run with us.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.303
We're gonna take the long way
to avoid the zombies.

12:24.372 --> 12:26.839
Plus, we get to do
extra running. Right, Tay?

12:26.907 --> 12:28.974
Oh, coward route? No, thank you.

12:29.043 --> 12:30.309
I'm gonna take the short course

12:30.378 --> 12:32.311
and plow right through the
zombies on my way to victory.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.379
I love it!

12:33.447 --> 12:34.713
<i>I hate her.</i>

12:34.782 --> 12:36.749
- On your mark... get set...
- You ready?

12:36.817 --> 12:38.217
...run for your lives!

12:39.186 --> 12:41.220
Whoo! Let's win it!

12:44.395 --> 12:45.891
Aah!

12:52.333 --> 12:54.199
<i>Luckily, I had someone on the inside,</i>

12:54.268 --> 12:57.169
<i>a volunteer who could give me
an unlimited amount of flags.</i>

12:57.238 --> 13:00.139
Why would your husband sponsor
such a stupid event?

13:00.207 --> 13:02.841
Oh, he poisoned some drinking
water in New Jersey.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.476
We're winning back the public's trust.

13:04.545 --> 13:06.211
Suck it in.

13:10.618 --> 13:11.618
Oh, hey.

13:11.652 --> 13:14.586
Whaaaa!

13:21.829 --> 13:23.729
Cheating's the best.

13:35.509 --> 13:38.010
<i>For the walking dead,
these guys are a little handsy.</i>

13:40.147 --> 13:41.680
No!

13:43.617 --> 13:45.784
Seriously?!

13:45.853 --> 13:47.186
Shut up!

13:47.254 --> 13:48.420
Three flags left

13:48.489 --> 13:50.055
and the obstacle course still ahead.

13:50.124 --> 13:51.423
What the hell am I gonna do?

13:51.492 --> 13:53.559
By flag count, you've lost
this race like 30 times.

13:53.627 --> 13:54.793
Are you even trying?

13:54.862 --> 13:56.962
I need more flags, Doris.
I need 'em bad.

13:57.031 --> 13:58.063
I'm out of flags.

13:58.132 --> 13:59.965
Besides, is Taylor really worth it?

14:00.034 --> 14:01.533
You've got like two others.

14:01.602 --> 14:03.035
Oh! I'm freaking out here!

14:03.103 --> 14:05.003
If I lose these flags,
then I lose to Viv,

14:05.072 --> 14:08.340
then I lose the chance to show
my daughter how great I am!

14:08.409 --> 14:10.709
Ow! Don't pinch my bingo wing.

14:10.778 --> 14:12.511
This isn't a pity party!

14:12.580 --> 14:14.713
You are Katie "Badass" Otto!

14:14.782 --> 14:16.682
You are strong. You are powerful.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.351
You raised three kids with no nannies,

14:19.420 --> 14:20.886
no housekeepers.

14:20.955 --> 14:23.856
Your whole life is this hideous,
depressing obstacle,

14:23.924 --> 14:26.024
and yet... you thrive.

14:26.093 --> 14:28.994
- Yeah.
- Oh, Katie, you can do this.

14:29.063 --> 14:31.196
Now, go!

14:34.935 --> 14:38.370
I shouldn't have taken a deep breath.

14:46.514 --> 14:48.496
<i>Doris is right. I can do this!</i>

14:48.597 --> 14:49.948
<i>I live this hell every day.</i>

14:54.154 --> 14:56.021
That's the smell!

14:59.059 --> 15:01.660
<i>FYI... teenage girls are disgusting.</i>

15:07.067 --> 15:08.534
<i>Piece of cake.</i>

15:08.602 --> 15:12.838
I don't know what it is.
My socks feel heavy today.

15:18.412 --> 15:19.811
<i>Pretty sure that's my dentist.</i>

15:25.319 --> 15:27.686
<i>I may not be a size 0 like Viv,</i>

15:27.755 --> 15:30.556
<i>but I have my way of getting
into tight spaces.</i>

15:30.624 --> 15:32.994
Let me in!

15:33.073 --> 15:34.805
- Would you please respect my privacy?
- No!

15:34.883 --> 15:37.229
- This is my house! My rules!
- Oh, my gosh.

15:37.298 --> 15:39.898
<i>Mommy rage beats kid rage any day.</i>

15:52.446 --> 15:54.112
Here. I'll give you a boost.

15:54.181 --> 15:55.681
Aren't you afraid they're gonna get you?

15:55.749 --> 15:57.549
No. Your safety is more important.

15:59.853 --> 16:00.853
Oliver!

16:01.889 --> 16:04.590
It's too late for me. Go!

16:08.862 --> 16:09.661
No!

16:09.730 --> 16:12.497
No!

16:12.566 --> 16:13.498
Oliver!

16:13.567 --> 16:15.267
Oh, my God.

16:15.336 --> 16:17.536
This kid just wet himself.

16:19.373 --> 16:22.441
Mom! I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

16:22.509 --> 16:23.842
That's what I thought about you

16:23.911 --> 16:25.310
when you rolled off
the changing table at 5 months.

16:25.379 --> 16:26.778
Is Viv gone?

16:26.847 --> 16:28.146
Did they kill her and eat her brains?

16:28.215 --> 16:29.548
Nah, when we came off the long course,

16:29.617 --> 16:30.749
some zombies chased her up a tree.

16:30.818 --> 16:32.784
Ah! Viv's going down!

16:32.853 --> 16:35.120
Why are you so obsessed with Viv?

16:35.189 --> 16:37.022
Okay.

16:37.091 --> 16:39.725
If I'm gonna be real,

16:39.793 --> 16:42.628
I guess I am just a little jealous.

16:42.696 --> 16:43.629
Of what?

16:43.697 --> 16:45.330
Remember our BBF Club?

16:45.399 --> 16:47.833
Yeah, Best Buds Forever.

16:47.901 --> 16:49.468
Just you and me, nobody else.

16:49.536 --> 16:51.570
Pinkie swears
to keep each other's secrets.

16:52.773 --> 16:53.972
Not now!

16:54.041 --> 16:55.874
What the hell, lady?
It's just a fun run.

16:55.943 --> 16:57.142
Look, I get it.

16:57.211 --> 16:59.746
14 is the age where you're
supposed to push your mom away.

16:59.813 --> 17:00.879
That lady just kicked me in the head.

17:00.948 --> 17:02.714
Shut up!

17:02.783 --> 17:05.150
But I just don't want you
to turn into Viv.

17:05.219 --> 17:06.484
I know it's selfish,

17:06.553 --> 17:08.353
but I want you to turn into me.

17:08.422 --> 17:10.922
Mom, please.
I'm not gonna turn into Viv.

17:10.991 --> 17:12.758
She has some great clothes,

17:12.826 --> 17:15.193
but her life is kind of sad.

17:15.262 --> 17:17.229
<i>Play it cool. Play it cool.
Play it cool.</i>

17:17.297 --> 17:19.731
- How so?
- Well, she's new in town.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.299
She has zero friends.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.035
I mean, she's obvi-kind of desperate,

17:23.103 --> 17:24.403
hanging with a 14-year-old.

17:24.471 --> 17:27.271
I mean, obvi. What about her own kids?

17:27.340 --> 17:28.974
Her two stepsons are so mean.

17:29.043 --> 17:30.575
You know what they call her?

17:30.644 --> 17:31.576
- What?
- Nothing.

17:31.645 --> 17:33.045
They won't even acknowledge her.

17:33.113 --> 17:35.213
And her husband is never, ever home.

17:35.282 --> 17:36.548
She's actually pretty lonely.

17:36.617 --> 17:39.184
And that's why you've
been hanging out with her.

17:40.988 --> 17:43.088
You, my sweet girl,

17:43.157 --> 17:44.523
are pretty amazing.

17:44.591 --> 17:45.857
Thanks, Mom.

17:47.494 --> 17:49.628
<i>The apple didn't roll
under Viv's tree or my tree.</i>

17:49.697 --> 17:51.163
<i>It rolled under Greg's.</i>

17:51.231 --> 17:53.799
<i>My teenager is a good person,
just like her dad.</i>

17:53.867 --> 17:55.701
<i>But this apple is heavy,
and I need to cut bait.</i>

17:55.769 --> 17:58.203
Sorry, honey, for everything,
but I still gotta win!

17:58.272 --> 18:00.105
Aah! I respect that!

18:00.174 --> 18:01.673
Thank you, honey!

18:04.712 --> 18:06.978
<i>Got nothing in the Mommy memory
bank for this bad boy.</i>

18:07.047 --> 18:08.747
<i>So the zombie path it is.</i>

18:10.851 --> 18:13.085
Well, it looks like
it's come down to thi...

18:13.153 --> 18:14.153
I wasn't finished!

18:14.188 --> 18:16.621
I wasn't finished!

18:20.627 --> 18:23.061
Do not touch my last flag!
I'm about to beat Viv!

18:23.130 --> 18:24.830
Greg, please!

18:24.898 --> 18:27.666
I know you're a rule-follower,
but just let me live.

18:29.403 --> 18:30.802
Go make your daughter proud.

18:30.871 --> 18:33.105
You just earned yourself
a quickie after this race.

18:33.173 --> 18:36.007
I might just have to lay there,
but I'll say dirty stuff.

18:39.179 --> 18:40.712
Ow! My ankle!

18:40.781 --> 18:42.681
Oh, baby, this is my chance!

18:44.184 --> 18:45.717
Aah!

18:47.521 --> 18:49.721
<i>Oh, my God. I'm gonna beat Viv.</i>

18:49.790 --> 18:51.189
<i>I'm gonna win.</i>

18:51.258 --> 18:52.958
Whoo!

18:54.394 --> 18:55.861
Whoo!

19:00.200 --> 19:01.500
Anna-Kat, you little rat!

19:01.568 --> 19:04.603
Why did you do that?
You could've let Mama win.

19:04.671 --> 19:06.271
Unh-unh.

19:08.841 --> 19:10.142
<i>All right.</i>

19:10.210 --> 19:12.677
<i>It's a win for Viv.</i>

19:12.746 --> 19:15.177
<i>And by the sound of it,
she could use it.</i>

19:15.263 --> 19:17.895
<i>Me... I've already won.</i>

19:17.989 --> 19:21.887
<i>My kids will always be mine.
I can't lose them to anybody.</i>

<i>They may not take after me,</i>

19:23.850 --> 19:25.691
<i>like Taylor or Oliver...</i>

19:25.692 --> 19:26.825
<i>...who are like Greg,</i>
