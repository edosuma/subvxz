Then, Brandon's party's

feel too bad...

10:40.807 --> 10:42.273

'cause she was, like,

10:42.342 --> 10:43.708
really embarrassed
about that whole thing.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.443
Every time you start
to get serious with a girl,

10:45.512 --> 10:47.178
she starts to hate
that girl.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.915
So, clearly it's because
she still has feelings
for you, then, right?

10:50.984 --> 10:54.919
'Cause what... what else...
what else would be the reason?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.389
But she could also go in,
like, Chloe defense mode

10:57.457 --> 11:01.259
and that can get
really ugly quick, so...

Juliette told me that

you two talked at BG's,

25:27.960 --> 25:30.160
completely standoff-ish

She was totally like,
"I've done nothing to you."

if Juliette's not gonna
own up to any of it,
