a bed and stuff tomorrow.

13:55.135 --> 13:58.603
Well, obviously you're
gonna need
somewhere to sleep.

13:58.605 --> 14:02.841
Yeah I was thinking
i could crash in the couch,
if that's cool with you guys.

14:02.843 --> 14:08.947
-Yeah.
-No, this couch is so hard,
it will throw your back out.

14:08.949 --> 14:12.984
Why don't you just
crash in my room and
i will bunk up with ray.

okay?

43:58.169 --> 44:01.771

one over on me and
i don't trust her.

44:01.773 --> 44:05.141
And you what?
The more I think about it,
this whole threesome thing

44:05.143 --> 44:08.277
was just the way for her to get
leverage over you and me
and it's fucking working.

44:08.279 --> 44:11.681
-You are spending way
too much time analyzing this.
-Am I?

44:13.751 --> 44:17.086
How is it a big deal man,
you can have a girlfriend
and I can't?

44:17.088 --> 44:21.824
Oh, wow.
So, so, she's your
girlfriend now?

44:23.494 --> 44:25.762

i don't know.

44:29.566 --> 44:30.867

44:34.638 --> 44:38.741
And guess what,
i fucked your girlfriend.
Deal with that.

44:38.743 --> 44:41.611

every time I date a girl
that's hotter than Jen.

44:42.146 --> 44:43.546

and I want you to stay.
Stop being so petty.

very good reason.

you'd secretly
fuck other dudes...

45:48.346 --> 45:53.349
I didn't secretly fuck anyone.
I didn't know that I had to be
explicit with you,

45:53.351 --> 45:57.687
that I wanted to see other
guys, I mean I thought I was
pretty strongly implying that

45:57.689 --> 45:59.555
yeah, well this isn't
gonna work.

45:59.557 --> 46:01.724
You and me,
it's not gonna work.

46:08.832 --> 46:09.899
I understand.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.202

46:18.842 --> 46:21.644
-Really?
Yeah, so does Bobby.

46:23.013 --> 46:24.180

46:31.688 --> 46:33.823
I'm not your girlfriend, right?

46:36.794 --> 46:39.929

46:39.931 --> 46:44.300
Not just in the last
couple of weeks, but
since I moved in.

46:44.302 --> 46:47.170
And I was really honest
with you about what
i wanted.

46:50.674 --> 46:52.875
But clearly you wanted
something different.

46:52.877 --> 46:56.212
And this reaction just
shows you weren't honest
with me.

46:56.214 --> 47:00.216
Okay, so somehow you fucking
other dudes is my fault.

47:02.119 --> 47:04.520

of government but
it's the best we've got.
