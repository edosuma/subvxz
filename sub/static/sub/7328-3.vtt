00:06.240 --> 00:08.676
( tractor motor humming )

00:08.709 --> 00:11.745
( radio plays country music )

00:17.618 --> 00:20.421
( country music continues )

00:31.632 --> 00:35.336
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:35.369 --> 00:38.806
and CBS

01:11.205 --> 01:13.774
Most people tend to their
personal hygiene at home.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.309
This bothers you?

01:15.343 --> 01:16.844
No, what bothers me

01:16.877 --> 01:18.512
is that it doesn't
bother me anymore.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.348
I'm an acquired taste.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.516
Actually, it's more like
the Stockholm syndrome.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.252
The emotional attachment

01:24.285 --> 01:25.386
to a captor formed by hostages

01:25.419 --> 01:27.655
are result
of continuous stress

01:27.688 --> 01:29.257
and a need to cooperate
for survival.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.858
( chuckles )

01:31.659 --> 01:33.227
Nice shot.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.163
Get the truck.
Where we going, boss?

01:35.196 --> 01:37.231
Smoky Corners, West Virginia.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.400
Marine helo was found abandoned.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.468
Crew's missing.
Any leads?

01:40.501 --> 01:42.236
You tell me.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.705
It's sitting in the
middle of a crop circle.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.140
Abby's going to make us crazy.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.676
Come on, let's go.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.651
( helicopter whirring )

02:02.456 --> 02:03.757
I don't believe it.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.162
They never make it easy.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.863
Lieutenant Colonel
Curtis Teague.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.833
Squadron CO. HMLA 167.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.636
Gibbs. NCIS.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.806
Colonel, your people
have contaminated the scene.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.341
I'm missing
two men, Gibbs.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.742
Wasn't going
to sit on my ass

02:21.775 --> 02:23.844
and wait for NCIS
to drive out from Washington.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.414
Yeah, well, we're going to have
to take elimination prints

02:26.447 --> 02:27.548
from all your people.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.818
Stand down, men.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.486
Let NCIS do their job.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.954
Stand down.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.423
Any damage
to the aircraft?
No.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.724
The engine checks out.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.726
Hydraulic and avionics gear
are operative.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.694
Fuel load's at 60 percent.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.530
When was your last
contact with the crew?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.632
They took off from
New River at 2300

02:44.665 --> 02:46.700
on a routine night
proficiency flight.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.802
Were cleared to a practice area
over Chesapeake Bay.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.871
Flight controller lost

02:50.904 --> 02:52.573
the transponder signal
ten minutes out.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.641
Tried to make
radio contact,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.476
never got a response.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.411
I was notified
a half hour later.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.379
How'd you find it?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.447
We were organizing to launch

02:59.480 --> 03:00.348
a search and rescue mission

03:00.381 --> 03:02.483
when I got a call
from the local sheriff.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.318
The farmer that owns
this field discovered it

03:04.352 --> 03:05.653
just after sunrise.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.222
DiNozzo.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.390
Yeah, boss?

03:09.423 --> 03:10.724
Sketch and shoot.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.792
Kate, the cockpit.

03:11.825 --> 03:12.826
Trace evidence, bag and tag.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.262
McGee, the field.
Lay out a grid.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.263
Got it.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.232
( helicopter whirring )

03:18.266 --> 03:19.733
TEAGUE:
We just started the air search.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.735
Hopefully we'll find them.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.305
I'm ignoring the fact
that my aircraft

03:24.338 --> 03:25.973
is in the middle
of a crop circle.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.641
What about you,
Agent Gibbs,

03:27.675 --> 03:28.776
what are your thoughts?

03:28.809 --> 03:32.480
Do I think your men were
abducted by aliens, Colonel? No.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.648
I don't, but I'm not
going to ignore anything.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.584
I need an overhead
view of the field.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.519
Already took digital photos.
Sergeant Ramos!

03:38.552 --> 03:39.987
Sir.
Camera.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.258
Who are the missing men?

03:44.292 --> 03:45.993
Pilot is Captain
Todd Newell.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.462
Co-pilot Captain
Patrick Barnett.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.598
Good marines.

03:50.631 --> 03:51.665
But they're young pilots.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.334
Hot shots.
The two are close.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.369
They share an apartment
off base.

03:55.403 --> 03:58.372
I need their Officer
Qualification Records

03:58.406 --> 04:00.908
and NATOPS jackets.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.943
( sighs ):
McGee!

04:04.011 --> 04:05.379
Yeah, boss?

04:05.413 --> 04:08.015
Shots of the crop circle.
E-mail them to Abby.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.583
Abby?

04:09.617 --> 04:10.651
You certain you want to do that?

04:10.684 --> 04:12.753
You know, she's obsessed
with the paranormal and...

04:13.954 --> 04:15.055
Right. I'm on it.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.592
I do not want UFO freaks
crawling around here, Colonel.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.694
Let's keep a lid on this.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.730
No releases to the media.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.365
Agreed.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.440
I should've been an aviator.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.375
These things are chick magnets.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.076
I hate helicopters.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.012
They're loud, uncomfortable
and dangerous.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.949
Used to dread getting on
Marine One with the President.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.785
Ew. Tony...
What?

04:44.818 --> 04:47.488
You're getting way
too comfortable around me.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.457
Okay, clipping your nails
is one thing,

04:49.490 --> 04:51.091
but that, that is
crossing the line.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.960
Come on.
No, I'm serious.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.828
I've had enough of
your locker room mentality.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.331
I would be upset
if someone I was dating--

04:57.365 --> 04:59.400
dating--
took such familiarities.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.834
Well, we work together.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.936
So feel free to scratch
or adjust anything you like

05:02.970 --> 05:04.672
in front of me.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.509
I'm always up before the sun.

05:08.542 --> 05:12.580
It's only 30 acres,
but it's a lot of work.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.848
You didn't hear anything
last night?

05:14.882 --> 05:16.384
Nothing.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.686
So how long you think
it's gonna be

05:18.719 --> 05:19.953
before they get
that thing out of here?

05:19.987 --> 05:20.888
I got work to do.

05:20.921 --> 05:25.893
What do you think
happened to your field?

05:25.926 --> 05:27.561
You're asking me?

05:27.595 --> 05:28.696
Ask the Air Force.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.097
This isn't the first
crop circle here.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.732
We had one

05:31.765 --> 05:33.066
in 1994.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.768
The Air Force investigated,

05:34.802 --> 05:36.036
but we never did
get no answers.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.706
There were lights
back then, too.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.007
Lights?

05:40.040 --> 05:42.042
Lit up the sky
last night.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.010
Woke me up.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.513
It wasn't lightning.
There was no thunder.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.648
Like I told you,
I didn't hear anything.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.916
Just tried to put
it out of my mind

05:48.949 --> 05:51.919
till I discovered this.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.987
We may have more questions
for you, Mr. Clay.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.990
I ain't going nowhere.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.728
Well, guess I should
ask around.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.830
See if anybody else
seen something.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.833
How long you been sheriff?

06:05.866 --> 06:08.035
Couple years now.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.038
Your full-time job?

06:11.071 --> 06:16.376
I also run the grain
and feed store.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.116
Whoa.
McGee, you are turning me on.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.119
It's very Glastonbury,
circa 1980s.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.955
I mean, not quite as large
or elaborate,

06:27.988 --> 06:29.623
but it's a fascinating
pictogram.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.091
I'm not familiar
with Glastonbury.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.059
Southern England?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.961
Where most of the crop circles
were found?

06:33.994 --> 06:35.463
Abby, they're hoaxes.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.564
You have to admit

06:36.597 --> 06:38.165
they are interesting.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.467
Yeah, I put them right up there

06:39.500 --> 06:40.868
with tarot cards
and telephone psychics.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.703
Thought two farmers
admitted to creating them.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.072
Yeah, but there's been
over 10,000 reported

06:45.105 --> 06:45.939
all over the world.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.875
There's no way
those two did them all.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.678
Abby, nothing paranormal
happened here.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.112
Yeah, there was no damage
to the helicopter,

06:52.145 --> 06:53.346
yet the entire crew vanished.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.983
You can't take crop circles
seriously, you're a scientist.

06:56.016 --> 06:56.950
There's a logical explanation.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.051
Listen to me, McGee.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.053
I need pictures,
and lots of them.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.590
And specimens of the stalks
down to the roots.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.592
And a core sample of soil,
at least 12 inches.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.059
Make sure you get
a control sample

07:06.093 --> 07:07.327
from outside the circle.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.097
Abby, we're looking for
two missing marines.
Come on, McGee.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.465
Do it for me, please?

07:11.499 --> 07:14.034
I'll show you my new tat.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.039
The replacement crew
is ready to fly the Cobra

07:19.072 --> 07:20.474
back to New River.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.075
Go ahead,
we got everything we need.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.844
Clear to go.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.979
Do we really need
all this stuff?

07:26.013 --> 07:28.115
Just following instructions.
Ask Abby.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.051
All right, McGee and I
will take the truck back.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.853
You two, check out
the pilots' apartment.

07:32.886 --> 07:33.821
Right.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.089
I'll try not to be
too familiar, Ms. Todd.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.527
Hey, get the scent articles
for the search dog.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.094
Okay.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.131
What is it, boss?

07:44.164 --> 07:48.268
I was worried about keeping
a lid on this thing.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.070
Where are the gawkers?

07:50.103 --> 07:51.972
You see any locals

07:52.005 --> 07:54.875
other than the farmer
who owns this field
and the sheriff?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.076
Special Agent Gibbs.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.210
The Huey spotted
a burnt-out area

07:57.244 --> 07:58.546
just north of here.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.780
You might want to come with us.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.563
TEAGUE:
You think this has something
to do with my crew?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.264
GIBBS:
I don't know,

08:17.297 --> 08:19.032
but we're going to find out.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.101
We've got another scene
to process.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.142
( door creaks )

08:33.213 --> 08:36.717
So, we're looking for
anything that suggests

08:36.750 --> 08:38.819
they didn't just leave
on a routine flight.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.123
Thanks for explaining,
Special Agent DiNozzo.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.169
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.340
Do you know what this is?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.910
This is a classic.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.945
December '92.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.681
Pamela's debut.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.817
I lost my copy.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.219
Lost it or wore it out?

09:12.252 --> 09:15.155
We need to get scent
articles for the dogs.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.320
What the hell are you doing
in my apartment?

09:47.354 --> 09:49.022
NCIS.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.324
Let her go.

10:02.703 --> 10:06.173
GIBBS:
I understand you're not
cooperating, Captain Barnett.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.075
I don't know anything.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.342
It's Saturday night.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.277
I was at my girlfriend's.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.680
Got home, just getting
out of the shower

10:12.713 --> 10:14.782
and I heard someone
in my apartment.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.650
Where's Captain Newell?

10:16.684 --> 10:19.152
I don't know.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.323
You were scheduled for
a proficiency flight

10:23.356 --> 10:25.258
at 2300 last night.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.727
Did you take it?

10:26.760 --> 10:30.063
What's the flight schedule say,
sir?

10:30.097 --> 10:31.732
Well, it says right here

10:31.765 --> 10:35.669
Newell and you took off
from New River.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.774
Then we did.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.211
Here's how it works, ace.

10:44.244 --> 10:48.281
I ask the questions,
you give direct answers.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.051
( bangs on table )

10:51.084 --> 10:53.153
Did you take the flight?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.858
I think Gibbs enjoys this
more than sex.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.293
That would explain
the three wives.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.695
Your Cobra was found
abandoned

11:01.729 --> 11:03.731
150 miles from where
it was supposed to be

11:03.764 --> 11:05.365
and Newell is missing.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.041
What is Gibbs doing?

11:14.074 --> 11:15.442
TBI.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.844
Excuse me?

11:16.877 --> 11:19.312
Truth by intimidation.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.981
In five...

11:21.014 --> 11:22.983
four... three...

11:23.016 --> 11:24.952
two... one.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.854
BARNETT:
We were leaving for the base

11:26.887 --> 11:29.857
when Todd got a call
on his cell.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.359
He took it into the bedroom.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.261
When he came out...

11:34.294 --> 11:37.497
( sighs ):
he was messed up.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.166
He said he wasn't
feeling well

11:39.199 --> 11:41.334
and wanted to call
the Squadron Deputy
Officer in Ops

11:41.368 --> 11:42.469
to cancel the hop.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.837
Who made the call?

11:43.871 --> 11:45.739
I don't know.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.440
I don't believe you, Barnett.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.309
You live together,
you fly together,

11:49.342 --> 11:51.178
you fight together,
you share everything.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.279
I thought we did.

11:52.312 --> 11:56.283
Look, I rode his ass
to figure out what was going on,

11:56.316 --> 11:59.352
but Todd, he got really pissed.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.123
Told me to lay low
for the rest of the night.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.492
He didn't want me
getting in trouble.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.796
And you let it go at that?

12:08.829 --> 12:12.432
Todd said he'd explain
when he got back.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.204
I believe him.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.873
Sign it.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.509
What did Gibbs
whisper in his ear?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.576
If I knew, I'd be Gibbs.

12:23.610 --> 12:27.180
I'm gonna go pull
Captain Newell's cell records.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.481
ABBY:
Did you feel an energy

12:28.515 --> 12:30.217
when you were inside
the circle, McGee?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.485
Did you get a
tingling sensation
or start to vibrate?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.354
You're gonna vibrate if you
don't do what Gibbs wants.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.356
I'm running tests
on the molecular structure

12:36.389 --> 12:37.991
of plants from within
and outside the circle.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.293
Okay, Abby, Gibbs
made it clear--

12:40.327 --> 12:41.795
the priority is the cabin fire.

12:41.829 --> 12:42.963
You know, people try to imitate

12:42.996 --> 12:44.998
the real thing,

12:45.032 --> 12:46.499
but the notion that all
recorded formations

12:46.533 --> 12:48.836
were man-made
with simple flattening tools

12:48.869 --> 12:50.537
does not explain
the well-documented

12:50.570 --> 12:52.806
plant alterations
by electromagnetic effect.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.541
I warned you.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.011
KATE:
Operation Duty Officer
at New River

12:58.045 --> 13:00.580
said that Captain Newell
signed the log.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.448
When I pressed, he admitted

13:01.481 --> 13:03.416
that he never really saw
Captain Barnett.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.418
He just assumed he was on
the flight line, preflighting.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.220
So Newell took off alone.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.455
Can you fly a Cobra by yourself?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.323
Oh, yes.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.258
Yeah, I'm still here.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.960
Anything unusual

13:12.993 --> 13:15.395
in Newell's OQR
or his NATOPS jacket?

13:15.428 --> 13:16.363
He's an only child.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.931
Grew up in Florida,
just outside Orlando.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.967
Any connection to West Virginia?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.135
No. His parents died in an auto
accident two years ago.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.937
His father sold insurance,
and mother
( telephone rings )

13:23.971 --> 13:25.405
was an accountant
at Disney World.

13:25.438 --> 13:28.508
Yeah, Gibbs.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.011
You can see Barnett
anytime you'd like, Colonel.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.612
Teague?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.614
Good C.O.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.648
Newell went through NROTC

13:35.682 --> 13:38.051
at the University of Florida
before flight school.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.287
His impulsiveness has gotten him
in some trouble.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.389
A fight cost him
a non-punitive letter
of caution.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.656
DiNOZZO:
That's great.

13:43.690 --> 13:47.995
Last call Captain Newell got on
his cell was at 2130 last night.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.197
Hasn't made or received
a call since.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.498
His phone is currently off.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.366
Where was the call from?

13:53.400 --> 13:56.569
A pay phone in Smoky Corners,
West Virginia.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.446
( dog barking )

14:13.453 --> 14:14.654
According to
the phone company,

14:14.687 --> 14:17.290
this thing hardly
ever gets used.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.559
Well, I guess even people
out here have cell phones.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.031
We're being watched.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.899
Mm-hmm. I see.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.972
Sheriff Thompson.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.307
You better get over here.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.382
Find anything?
It's clean.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.018
Too clean.
Not even a smudge.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.519
Yeah, looks like
the only thing out here

14:46.553 --> 14:48.155
that has been cleaned recently.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.889
Let me have a whack at it.

14:54.962 --> 14:57.097
What's he doing?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.466
Shh!

15:04.471 --> 15:07.340
Okay. Get those
to Abby for prints.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.045
What are you doing
to the phone?

15:12.079 --> 15:13.646
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.017
Who are you?

15:17.050 --> 15:19.019
Ritt Everett.
This is my store.

15:19.052 --> 15:23.723
Seen anyone using the phone
Tuesday night?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.658
Well, let's see.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.160
Nope.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.161
( car approaches )

15:28.195 --> 15:30.663
This have anything to do
about that helicopter

15:30.697 --> 15:32.065
in the crop circle?

15:33.366 --> 15:34.567
Hello, Sheriff.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.070
Special Agent Gibbs.
Any luck?

15:37.104 --> 15:39.206
Well, sir, luck doesn't have
much to do with it.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.207
I've been asking around.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.375
Lot of folks seen them lights

15:42.409 --> 15:46.179
and are complaining their
animals are acting out of sorts.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.714
How?

15:47.747 --> 15:50.217
Chickens stopped
laying eggs.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.053
Cows ain't producing,
and stuff like that.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.091
Either of you two
seen him around?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.661
No.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.563
Name's Newell.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.098
Captain Todd Newell.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.334
Sorry, ain't seen him.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.602
Newell? Ain't nobody by
that name in the Corners.

16:09.636 --> 16:13.240
I'll keep an eye
out for him.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.143
Was he the one
flying that helicopter?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.745
( cell phone rings )

16:21.681 --> 16:22.715
Yeah, Gibbs.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.652
ABBY:
Gibbs, I am getting
stonewalled here.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.387
By who?
The Air Force.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.190
I requested their file
on the 1994 crop circles

16:30.223 --> 16:32.092
in Smoky Corners,
you'd thought I'd asked them

16:32.125 --> 16:33.726
for their missile-launch codes.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.028
Okay, I'll make a call.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.063
No, you don't understand.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.265
They're not going
to tell you anything either.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.766
This is like Area 51;

16:39.799 --> 16:41.268
it is conspiracy
at the highest level.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.170
Abby, stop yourself.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.271
What about the cabin fire?

16:44.304 --> 16:45.805
Gibbs, this is big!

16:45.838 --> 16:46.639
The fire.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.640
( sighs )

16:47.674 --> 16:50.677
Unfortunately, nothing
extraterrestrial there;

16:50.710 --> 16:53.146
arson, plain old gasoline
was used as an accelerant.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.615
I'm still working on the debris.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.750
Science can't be rushed, Gibbs.

17:03.756 --> 17:04.391
Hi.

17:04.424 --> 17:07.394
You all right?

17:07.427 --> 17:10.363
Yeah, fine.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.233
Ever see him around here?

17:16.769 --> 17:19.439
Your gal going to be okay?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.708
Don't you worry
about her.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.211
As long as both sides
stick to the story,

17:24.244 --> 17:27.080
we'll get through this.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.652
I can't talk right now.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.787
But if you come
back at noon,

17:34.821 --> 17:36.256
my daddy will be at the VFW

17:36.289 --> 17:37.757
in Potterville.

17:37.790 --> 17:38.791
Okay.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.599
Who's that?

17:46.633 --> 17:48.701
The station owner's
daughter, Daphne.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.837
I think she wanted
to talk, but couldn't.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.306
Her father's having lunch
with his buddies at the VFW

17:53.340 --> 17:54.674
in Potterville around noon.

17:54.707 --> 17:55.742
She'll be alone.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.296
TEAGUE:
The dogs are a no-go.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.365
The handlers say something
screwed up the dogs.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.799
As soon as they stepped
into the woods,

18:19.832 --> 18:21.468
they started acting up.

18:22.902 --> 18:23.803
Do not tell Abby.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.206
She's going to make something
out of it.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.708
We should start checking
the back of their necks

18:28.741 --> 18:29.709
for little red Xs.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.644
What are you talking about?

18:31.678 --> 18:33.713
Invaders From Mars.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.849
Wait. I take it that's a film?

18:36.883 --> 18:38.885
Original 1953 version,
not the remake.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.753
Everything's a movie
to you, Tony.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.523
Aliens landed in a field
just like this one.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.559
Took over the locals' minds,
leaving a little red "X"

18:46.593 --> 18:47.894
on the back of the necks.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.262
Sounds lame.

18:49.296 --> 18:53.200
Oh, no.
Scariest movie I ever saw.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.368
Especially when this kid
tries to tell his mom and dad

18:55.402 --> 18:56.369
what's going on,

18:56.403 --> 18:58.371
the camera slowly
comes around,

18:58.405 --> 19:04.344
reveals Xs on the back
of Mom and Dad's necks.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.679
Whew. Scared of my parents
for years after that.

19:06.713 --> 19:07.680
I'm sure the feeling
was mutual.

19:07.714 --> 19:08.581
Find anything?

19:08.615 --> 19:11.218
Uh, yeah, interviewed
half a dozen locals.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.952
Nobody saw or heard
a helicopter.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.221
Everyone has the same story.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.356
B.O.L.s.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.690
"Balls of light."

19:17.724 --> 19:19.459
According to Abby,
they're created by

19:19.492 --> 19:20.793
manipulating
the atomic particles

19:20.827 --> 19:21.661
in the atmosphere.

19:21.694 --> 19:26.699
Mm. And who does
the manipulating, McGee?

19:26.733 --> 19:27.567
I really don't know, sir.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.801
I'm just relating
what Abby told me.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.879
I need you to run
a tox screen

19:39.912 --> 19:40.913
on this tissue sample.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.349
Where'd you get it?

19:42.382 --> 19:44.517
A body exhumed
from Arlington.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.986
You look overwhelmed.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.855
I am.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.823
And this just came in
from the field.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.892
Gibbs wants me to run
prints on it ASAP.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.997
It appears to be to be $1.65.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.866
This poor soul's
been dead for 36 years.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.734
I doubt if a few more days
will matter.

20:01.768 --> 20:02.902
Thank you, Ducky.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.371
Yeah.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.240
Door handle?

20:07.274 --> 20:08.908
Yeah, it came from
a cabin fire.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.943
I found traces
of something in it.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.712
I can use a second opinion.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.981
I'm flattered.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.587
Mammalian cells.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.689
Most likely human flesh.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.357
Someone was trapped
I that fire.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.025
A missing Marine aviator?

20:26.058 --> 20:27.727
I need to call Gibbs.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.297
Could be his missing
aviator is dead.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.864
If he died,

20:31.898 --> 20:34.667
where are his remains?

20:37.404 --> 20:38.871
DiNOZZO:
We know
the fire was arson.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.808
It started around the same time
Newell and his helo disappeared.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.411
Abby was pretty certain
somebody was in the cabin.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.578
But we didn't
find any remains.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.280
Maybe they got out.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.715
Or someone
removed the body.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.317
Until we find remains,

20:50.350 --> 20:51.684
I'm not going
to connect the dots.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.287
Time to get the cadaver dogs
up to aid the search.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.556
Cadaver dogs coming up.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.825
This your cabin, Mr. Clay?

20:58.858 --> 21:01.594
Nope. No.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.330
My land stops
right over there

21:03.363 --> 21:04.497
at the treeline there.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.998
Who's it belong to?

21:06.032 --> 21:07.500
Well, nobody, really.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.569
Went to the county
after Monroe died.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.671
Who was Monroe?

21:11.704 --> 21:12.705
A farmer
from the east side.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.607
Tried working this parcel.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.042
Didn't have no chance, though.

21:16.075 --> 21:16.509
Too hard to clear.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.944
How'd Monroe die?

21:17.977 --> 21:20.580
Hunting. Accident.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.383
Shack's been abandoned
ever since.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.352
I ain't sorry
it burned, though.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.355
Kids was always using
the place, causing trouble.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.761
Something wrong?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.801
Bet his bark's worse
than his bite, huh?

21:41.834 --> 21:43.603
Uh, the bite's
actually much worse.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.056
Daphne?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.041
( gasps )

22:24.544 --> 22:26.546
Whatcha lookin' fer?

22:26.579 --> 22:28.748
I need gas.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.722
This way, Missy.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.899
That'll be $6.00.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.972
That's ten.

22:55.007 --> 22:58.177
That's two, that's three,

22:58.210 --> 23:00.813
four dollars.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.616
Sure that's all
you want?

23:03.650 --> 23:05.117
( engine starts )

23:13.793 --> 23:15.027
MAN:
So, uh...

23:15.061 --> 23:16.896
what can State Police

23:16.929 --> 23:18.197
do for NCIS?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.566
Well, we're investigating

23:19.599 --> 23:21.000
a helicopter incident
in Smoky Corners.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.935
Yeah, I heard.

23:22.969 --> 23:23.803
You, uh...?
Sure.

23:23.836 --> 23:24.837
Have a seat.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.939
Met the sheriff.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.608
Oh, Miller Thompson?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.610
Yeah, he wasn't
much help.

23:30.643 --> 23:33.446
Well, he doesn't know jack
about law enforcement.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.582
But he sure loves
wearing that uniform.

23:35.615 --> 23:38.751
You get to Smoky Corners much?

23:38.785 --> 23:40.887
Well, not unless they call.
And they don't.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.856
Hmm. No crime?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.758
Nothing we get involved in.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.026
There's a few fights.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.462
Got some kind of feud
going on up there.

23:49.496 --> 23:50.530
Goes back
decades.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.499
What, like Hatfields and McCoys?

23:52.532 --> 23:53.866
Yeah, something
like that.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.803
I honestly don't think anyone
remembers how it started,

23:56.836 --> 23:57.937
but it split the valley

23:57.970 --> 23:59.672
right down the middle,
east versus west,

23:59.706 --> 24:02.174
and I was told by my
predecessor to stay clear.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.645
Truth is, they take care
of their own problems.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.948
Have they ever had a murder
in Smoky Corners?

24:08.981 --> 24:10.116
Not that
I know of.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.752
I mean, people just
die of natural causes

24:12.785 --> 24:15.021
or, you know, the occasional
farm or hunting accident.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.559
Things may have changed.

24:21.728 --> 24:25.031
( beeping )

24:36.909 --> 24:38.578
What's McGee doing out there?

24:38.611 --> 24:41.047
Scanning the field
with a magnetometer.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.982
Let me guess--
Abby?

24:43.015 --> 24:46.185
Her every wish is his command.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.987
She promised to show him
her new tattoo.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.089
Wait till he finds out
it's on her ankle.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.025
What did gas station
girl tell you?

24:53.059 --> 24:55.227
She was a no-show.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.930
Hmm, looks like
he found something.

25:31.297 --> 25:32.932
( gasps )

25:37.704 --> 25:39.005
You are such
a child.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.039
Come on.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.912
Just taking a sip.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.780
It's yours.

25:47.814 --> 25:48.881
Hey, boss.

25:48.915 --> 25:49.982
Abby needs to talk to you.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.885
Abs, you get any sleep?

25:52.919 --> 25:55.021
I am overworked
and not paid enough.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.923
Quit.
What do you got?

25:56.956 --> 25:59.692
Two partial prints on the coins
from the phone booth.

25:59.726 --> 26:00.793
Any match?

26:00.827 --> 26:02.895
You need to send a thank you

26:02.929 --> 26:03.963
to the West Virginia DMV.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.231
The got right index prints

26:05.264 --> 26:06.733
from two licensed drivers.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.234
One was the trucker that

26:08.267 --> 26:09.636
delivered gasoline
to the station,

26:09.669 --> 26:12.071
the second was a local,
Greg Sikes.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.973
On it.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.241
You get any DNA
off the doorknob?

26:15.274 --> 26:16.643
( scoffs )

26:16.676 --> 26:18.945
"Nice work
on those prints, Abs."

26:18.978 --> 26:19.946
Thank you.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.048
"I know you haven't had
a break in two days."

26:22.081 --> 26:23.149
Oh, that's okay.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.283
I don't need much sleep.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.384
Anything for the team.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.386
I assume you'll let me know
if you find something.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.387
Don't I always?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.356
Yeah, Abby, you do.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.959
Thank you.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.060
MAN:
Agent Gibbs.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.062
The cadaver dogs
have found something.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.177
Get Ducky.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.687
Smoky Corners
bachelor quarters.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.322
Something to be said
for living in a trailer.

27:03.355 --> 27:09.095
Get tired of the view, you just
roll it to a new location.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.963
Come on, McGee.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.832
What, are you
never going to
talk to me again?

27:12.865 --> 27:14.200
How long am I going to be

27:14.233 --> 27:15.935
the butt of
your practical jokes,

27:15.968 --> 27:17.670
snide innuendos
and juvenile put-downs?

27:17.704 --> 27:22.942
I will always
outrank you, probie.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.144
Come on.

27:31.918 --> 27:34.020
Mr. Sikes, NCIS.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.730
Whoa.

27:43.763 --> 27:44.931
Come on in.

27:55.842 --> 27:56.776
Someone left in a hurry.

28:06.252 --> 28:07.754
Huh, no phone.

28:14.093 --> 28:16.295
Ah, nice...
teeth.

28:16.963 --> 28:18.497
Duck, what can you tell me?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.366
Uh, not much.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.468
Male, roughly six feet.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.304
Tests I did
on femur, clavicle,

28:25.337 --> 28:27.039
suggest not that old.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.207
Give me a range.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.441
Mid 20's to 30's.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.411
Oh, this distinctive fracture

28:32.444 --> 28:34.513
on the inferior left scapula

28:34.546 --> 28:37.416
is consistent
with a bullet wound.

28:37.449 --> 28:38.350
Cause of death?

28:38.384 --> 28:39.451
Well, maybe.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.453
Or it could be trauma
or asphyxiation.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.156
I don't know
if I'll ever be certain.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.825
There's not much
to work with, Jethro.

28:45.858 --> 28:46.826
Gibbs!

28:46.859 --> 28:48.327
Yeah?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.362
I used nonisotopic
chemiluminescent method

28:50.396 --> 28:51.798
to compare the charred DNA
to Newell's.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.299
Uh-huh, and?

28:53.332 --> 28:55.802
And it's not his DNA.
But it's damn close.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.403
Oh, come on, Abs.
We're not playing horseshoes.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.305
There's a 99% probability

28:59.338 --> 29:02.474
that the fire victim
is Newell's male sibling.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.276
That can't be.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.145
Newell's record of emergency
data doesn't list a brother.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.347
DNA doesn't lie,
Jethro.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.116
People do.

29:10.149 --> 29:13.185
The crispy critter
was Captain Newell's brother.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.453
His OQR was wrong?

29:14.486 --> 29:17.523
Recruits lie about things all
the time, especially their age.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.425
Why lie about
having a brother?

29:19.458 --> 29:20.993
Is Abby sure?

29:21.027 --> 29:22.528
Yeah, she double checked.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.897
Obviously you two didn't.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.198
We assumed his family
history was right.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.935
NCIS agents don't assume
anything, Agent Todd.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.303
They check
and re-check.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.504
Verify,

29:32.538 --> 29:33.505
everything,

29:33.539 --> 29:35.074
independently.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.843
We are on it.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.212
ABBY:
There's a definite difference.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.247
I don't see it.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.850
Look at the elongated node.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.284
It's undamaged.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.486
The plants inside the crop
circle were changed in a way

29:47.519 --> 29:49.088
that is beyond human ability.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.356
I'm rerunning

29:50.389 --> 29:52.091
an analysis hoping to find

29:52.124 --> 29:55.127
anomalous molecular change
to the stalks within the circle.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.495
I'm betting they were subjected

29:56.528 --> 29:58.330
to a very short blast
of high energy

29:58.364 --> 29:59.999
heat, possibly microwave
generated.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.834
Rerunning because
you came up empty.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.070
Abby, you're looking

30:04.103 --> 30:05.371
for something that isn't there.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.973
You've been here
for two days straight.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.507
You're tired,
you've done everything that

30:08.540 --> 30:10.342
Gibbs has asked, so go
home, get some sleep.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.377
I can't sleep.

30:12.444 --> 30:13.412
What are you doing?

30:13.445 --> 30:15.047
You're guilty of

30:15.081 --> 30:16.048
confirmation bias.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.083
It's not there,
Abs.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.084
You're ignoring

30:18.117 --> 30:19.085
the obvious and you're

30:19.118 --> 30:20.086
searching for microscopic proof

30:20.119 --> 30:21.087
of something that doesn't exist.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.055
Maybe I should join the CIA.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.523
Look at the big picture.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.359
The design of the smaller
outer circles was created

30:27.393 --> 30:30.362
by bending the corn stalks
down in a clockwise direction.

30:30.396 --> 30:33.199
Now look under the helicopter.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.300
Those pants
were forced

30:34.333 --> 30:37.403
outward from the center by
the downdraft of the blades.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.538
The corn was
still standing

30:39.571 --> 30:42.541
and was forced down
by the landing of the Cobra.

30:42.574 --> 30:46.012
Crop circle's
a hoax, Abby.

30:46.045 --> 30:50.382
Created, created around
a parked helicopter.

30:50.416 --> 30:54.186
Why would anyone do that?

30:54.220 --> 30:57.289
Orange County clerk faxed us his
parents marriage certificate.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.458
Todd Newell was nine years old
when his mother remarried.

30:59.491 --> 31:02.528
he was legally adopted, that's
how he got the Newell name.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.563
His mother's maiden name
was Stelling,

31:04.596 --> 31:06.165
which is common
in Smoky Corners.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.499
First husband's
a guy named Sikes.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.667
They had two boys--

31:08.700 --> 31:09.535
Greg and Todd.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.570
Todd Newell was born
in Smoky Corners.

31:11.603 --> 31:12.804
His co-pilot, Captain Barnett,

31:12.838 --> 31:15.574
swears that he never mentioned
a brother or Smoky Corners.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.643
In fact, Barnett
couldn't recall Newell

31:17.676 --> 31:19.345
ever mentioning anything
about his childhood.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.013
We need to find
his biological father.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.382
Can't, he died
several years ago...

31:23.415 --> 31:25.051
in a hunting accident.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.486
Aw, gee, where have I heard
that one before?

31:27.519 --> 31:29.488
So we got a dead civilian
in Ducky's cooler.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.490
We going to turn it over
to the local authorities?

31:31.523 --> 31:32.491
Nope, not yet.

31:32.524 --> 31:33.159
I want to know more, first.

31:33.192 --> 31:33.825
Greg Sikes was involved with

31:33.859 --> 31:34.493
the girl at the gas station.

31:34.526 --> 31:35.161
She seemed willing to talk.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.429
Maybe I should
go back there

31:37.463 --> 31:40.099
and try
to find her.
Go with her.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.968
McGEE:
All right, so we're on

31:42.001 --> 31:43.069
the same page, right?

31:43.102 --> 31:44.503
I guess, but let
me tell Gibbs.

31:44.536 --> 31:45.504
Tell me what?

31:45.537 --> 31:47.373
The crop circle
was a hoax,

31:47.406 --> 31:49.175
created around the helicopter
after it landed.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.078
You don't sound convincing, Abs.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.280
Yeah, well, there's
still a lot of stuff

31:54.313 --> 31:56.082
that can't be
explained.
Like what?

31:56.115 --> 31:57.249
Balls of light in the sky,

31:57.283 --> 31:58.584
the animals
acting weird,

31:58.617 --> 32:00.119
like, a missing pilot.

32:00.152 --> 32:01.620
Everyone's story
is exactly the same.

32:01.653 --> 32:02.654
It's too rehearsed.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.689
It's what they

32:03.722 --> 32:04.991
want us to hear.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.725
That's exactly what I told her.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.826
But what about
the search dogs?

32:07.859 --> 32:10.562
I heard they were acting all
confused and disoriented.

32:10.596 --> 32:11.563
Only the
first day.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.165
The cadaver dogs

32:13.199 --> 32:15.667
had no problem finding
the body this morning.

32:18.604 --> 32:22.508
I know why we haven't been able
to find Captain Newell.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.145
Thanks, guys.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.247
How do you know?

32:30.316 --> 32:33.219
Because I'm a Marine.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.221
Newell is alive?

32:35.254 --> 32:36.388
Yeah.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.390
Well, who's body did we find?

32:38.424 --> 32:40.092
His brother.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.693
Captain Newell's
still out there.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.529
How do you know that?

32:43.562 --> 32:46.065
He received SERE training,
Colonel.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.599
He's evading us.

32:47.633 --> 32:51.170
As part of his training
he was taught a technique

32:51.203 --> 32:52.438
to negate enemy dogs.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.640
Yeah, GS powder, the irritant
used in gas mask simulations.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.243
I keep a couple of capsules
in my survival vest.

32:57.276 --> 33:00.246
Dogs get a whiff of that,
they're useless for days.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.014
He used it on the search dogs.

33:02.048 --> 33:05.251
Now he also has pilot's
night-vision goggles

33:05.284 --> 33:08.320
and a survival radio to monitor
our communications.

33:08.354 --> 33:14.260
Colonel, he's using his Marine
Corps training to evade us.

33:22.434 --> 33:26.205
( making rhythmic noises )

33:26.238 --> 33:28.040
Will you stop that?

33:28.074 --> 33:30.076
You're driving me crazy.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.443
Sorry.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.045
Do I detect a little PMS?

33:33.079 --> 33:34.646
I didn't think
that was till next week.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.083
Hey, it's a
high-stress job.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.750
You carry
a gun.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.552
I need to know
when you're not your best.

33:40.586 --> 33:41.653
Sike's trailer

33:41.687 --> 33:42.488
is coming up.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.021
Daphne wasn't
at the gas station.

33:43.055 --> 33:43.755
If she's not there,

33:43.789 --> 33:45.791
I don't
know where else to look.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.234
That's Daphne's truck.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.268
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.212
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

34:06.245 --> 34:07.579
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.215
Hey! Hey!

34:09.248 --> 34:11.183
Daphne, why are you running?

34:11.217 --> 34:13.352
I thought you wanted
to talk to us, Daphne.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.053
Daphne,
talk to us.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.457
What happened?

34:18.490 --> 34:20.226
What happened?

34:20.259 --> 34:22.328
Are you looking
for Greg?

34:22.361 --> 34:23.695
We know he's
your boyfriend,

34:23.729 --> 34:25.364
that's why we're here
looking for you, okay?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.599
Where is he?

34:30.469 --> 34:35.474
Daphne, are
you pregnant?

34:38.144 --> 34:40.412
Five months.

34:40.446 --> 34:43.549
Greg's hiding
from my daddy.

34:43.582 --> 34:46.152
You know where he is?

34:46.185 --> 34:49.087
( sighs )

34:51.390 --> 34:54.293
Greg's dead, isn't he?

35:03.202 --> 35:06.772
( horn blowing )

35:06.805 --> 35:07.673
GIBBS:
Whatever Newell's
brother said

35:07.706 --> 35:09.708
to him on the phone
got him upset enough

35:09.741 --> 35:12.311
to risk his entire career

35:12.344 --> 35:14.180
with an unauthorized
flight in a Cobra.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.415
Boss, you sure you don't want me
to drive for a while?

35:16.448 --> 35:17.816
But why land in
the farmer's field?

35:17.849 --> 35:19.418
Um, well...

35:21.220 --> 35:22.288
My guess,

35:22.321 --> 35:24.223
McGee...

35:24.256 --> 35:25.924
it was the closest clearing
to the cabin

35:25.957 --> 35:29.628
where is brother was hiding,
only Newell was too late.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.366
( horns honking )

35:34.400 --> 35:36.168
Wh-What?

35:36.202 --> 35:37.569
Focus on the case, McGee.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.406
Sorry, uh,
yes, Sir.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.308
Why the crop circle?

35:42.341 --> 35:44.676
Well, uh,
I have a theory on that.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.478
You care to share?

35:46.512 --> 35:47.446
Yeah, uh, okay.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.281
Spit it out, McGee.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.450
Okay, uh...

35:51.483 --> 35:52.284
Whoever killed Greg Sikes

35:52.318 --> 35:54.486
thought that they could
cover it up

35:54.520 --> 35:57.423
as another farm or
hunting accident.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.258
But they couldn't cover up
an attack helicopter

35:59.291 --> 36:00.392
abandoned in a corn field.

36:00.426 --> 36:01.760
Conspiracy, huh?

36:01.793 --> 36:02.961
Makes sense.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.897
Take a lot of people to form
that pattern in a few hours.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.333
Right, and they knew that

36:07.366 --> 36:08.434
there would be
an outside investigation,

36:08.467 --> 36:11.370
so they created
the circle hoping that

36:11.403 --> 36:13.605
we'd do exactly what the Air
Force did ten years ago--

36:13.639 --> 36:16.442
back off and cover up what
couldn't be explained.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.744
Not bad, McGee.
( honking )

36:18.777 --> 36:20.746
Not bad.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.389
Where is she?

36:30.422 --> 36:32.391
Inside, she seemed to relate
better to Kate.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.396
Enjoy the ride, McGee?

36:40.532 --> 36:42.368
Daphne's father threatened
to kill Greg because...

36:42.401 --> 36:44.636
BOTH:
She's pregnant.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.706
Greg and me from different
corners of the valley.

36:47.739 --> 36:51.910
God, I hate this rotten place.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.313
This stupid
feud.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.514
When'd you last see him?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.849
At the gas station.

36:57.883 --> 37:01.987
Using the payphone to call
his brother for help.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.622
Was Greg close to his brother?

37:03.655 --> 37:06.492
He hadn't seen him
since they was kids.

37:06.525 --> 37:10.462
About a year ago he got a call
telling him their mother died.

37:10.496 --> 37:12.998
It reunited
them.

37:13.031 --> 37:16.468
They're the only family either
of them have left.

37:16.502 --> 37:17.903
Daphne's afraid
that Captain Newell's

37:17.936 --> 37:19.905
been drawn
back into the feud.

37:19.938 --> 37:25.311
He's gonna kill my daddy
to get revenge.

37:25.344 --> 37:28.447
Kate, you and McGee
get Daphne out of here.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.681
( phone dialing )

37:29.715 --> 37:32.718
What's up, boss?

37:32.751 --> 37:34.986
Go for Teague.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.755
Colonel, call off the search.
Pull your men out.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.457
Why? You said Newell's
still out there.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.427
He is. He wants revenge.

37:41.460 --> 37:44.630
But he's not going to make his
move until he thinks we're gone.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.040
They're leaving.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.047
Ritt, we pulled it off.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.515
The Marines have
backed off.

38:03.549 --> 38:04.616
This thing's
going away.

38:04.650 --> 38:08.620
Nobody's told
outsiders nothing.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.459
My problem...

38:13.492 --> 38:16.462
is Greg Sikes' brother.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.497
See, I got
to get him,

38:18.530 --> 38:21.032
'for he gets me.

38:21.066 --> 38:24.703
( over radio ):
This is White Hawk 3-4.

38:24.736 --> 38:25.837
Terminating search.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.906
Returning to base.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.475
3-4 out.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.944
( groaning )

38:32.978 --> 38:36.582
Ritt, think twice about
what you're fixing to do.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.717
( vehicle approaching )

38:41.687 --> 38:43.355
They ain't got nothing, Ritt.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.557
Just stick
to the story.

38:47.626 --> 38:48.326
What's going on?

38:48.360 --> 38:50.429
Looks like y'all
are pulling out.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.030
The Marines are, we aren't.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.568
Do you get a kick

38:56.602 --> 38:59.371
out of smacking
your daughter around?

38:59.405 --> 39:01.807
Why don't you just
get out of here?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.008
DiNozzo, read him
his rights.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.643
What are you talking about?

39:04.676 --> 39:07.846
The murder of Greg Sikes.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.883
Greg Sikes is dead?

39:11.917 --> 39:15.621
I thought
he went hunting.

39:15.654 --> 39:18.390
We found his remains.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.591
DiNOZZO:
You have the right
to remain silent.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.159
Anything you say
can and will be used

39:21.192 --> 39:22.428
against you
in a court of law.

39:22.461 --> 39:23.462
Ain't you out
of your jurisdiction?

39:23.495 --> 39:25.531
You're the law here, Miller.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.633
Yeah, I am.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.601
Don't get excited,
Sheriff.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.537
The West Virginia
State Police are

39:31.570 --> 39:32.638
on their way,

39:32.671 --> 39:35.173
but I do have the authority
to detain both of you

39:35.206 --> 39:36.508
until they arrive.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.880
( panting )

39:44.783 --> 39:47.018
MAN 1 ( on TV ):
We, too, have guns.

39:47.052 --> 39:50.055
White man has more guns
and more warriors.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.692
MAN 2:
We need one of your people

39:53.725 --> 39:55.494
to guide us through
the mountains.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.734
Gibbs, I have a bogey.

40:02.768 --> 40:06.037
In the trees, closing in
from the northwest.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.072
Everybody copy.

40:07.105 --> 40:07.739
Yeah, boss.

40:07.773 --> 40:08.774
Got it.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.713
He slipped behind the old cars.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.548
Let him get closer.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.116
Roger that.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.194
( panting )

40:33.499 --> 40:34.900
Oh, man.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.569
GIBBS:
Everybody copy.

40:37.603 --> 40:38.670
( light clangs )

40:42.674 --> 40:43.642
He made me.

40:43.675 --> 40:44.476
Hit the lights!

40:57.288 --> 40:59.758
NCIS! Lower your weapon,
Captain Newell!

40:59.791 --> 41:01.092
It's over.

41:03.595 --> 41:06.632
It's not over till
Ritt Everett's dead.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.634
He's in the custody
of the State Police.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.802
That's not going
to change anything.

41:10.836 --> 41:13.071
It's an eye-for-an-eye here,
always has been.

41:13.104 --> 41:16.808
Is that why your mother
took you away?

41:20.579 --> 41:23.649
Put down your weapon.

41:23.682 --> 41:26.885
Why? I'm never going
to fly again.

41:26.918 --> 41:28.687
No, your career's
probably over,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.188
but you haven't hurt
anybody yet.

41:30.221 --> 41:31.122
Keep it that way,

41:31.156 --> 41:34.059
and I'll do everything
I can to help you.

41:39.164 --> 41:44.302
There is a young girl
carrying your brother's baby

41:44.335 --> 41:48.874
and they could sure use
your help.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.616
Once we left,

41:57.649 --> 42:01.620
it was like Smoky Corners
never existed.

42:01.653 --> 42:05.290
My mother erased it
from our lives.

42:05.323 --> 42:09.728
I always felt guilty
she had to leave Greg behind,

42:09.761 --> 42:14.232
but our father
wouldn't let her
have both of us.

42:14.265 --> 42:16.234
Why'd you take the Cobra?

42:16.267 --> 42:22.841
It's fierce,
intimidating.

42:22.874 --> 42:26.244
I hoped it would scare
the crap out of those hicks,

42:26.277 --> 42:27.879
save Greg's life.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.882
And I was too late.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.017
The cabin was in flames,

42:32.050 --> 42:35.654
Greg trapped inside.

42:37.656 --> 42:39.290
Everett and the others
started shooting at me

42:39.324 --> 42:40.325
and I got hit.

42:40.358 --> 42:45.597
And they had hunting rifles,
I only had my pistol.

42:45.631 --> 42:51.369
I was cut off from the helo,
couldn't get back to the base.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.205
I knew my Marine Corps career
was over.

42:56.742 --> 42:59.778
All that was left for me
was revenge.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.918
Wow, those are really pretty,
Kate.

43:06.952 --> 43:07.786
Where are they from?

43:07.819 --> 43:10.856
Tony.

43:13.391 --> 43:14.726
We had a tough couple of days.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.828
Kate pointed out that

43:16.862 --> 43:18.063
I'd taken one too many
liberties.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.330
The flowers are a mea culpa.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.132
Tony, I'm blown away.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.801
They're gorgeous.

43:22.834 --> 43:24.703
And they're from
Martha's Garden,

43:24.736 --> 43:26.237
my favorite florist.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.405
How'd you know?

43:27.438 --> 43:28.907
Lucky guess.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.042
He went through your purse

43:31.076 --> 43:32.978
and got the phone number
off your PDA.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.382
