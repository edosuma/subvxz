WEBVTT

00:06.573 --> 00:08.208
Love seeing that, guys.
Here we go, y'all. I still have my steal,

00:08.208 --> 00:10.477
and I'm feeling really
confident.

00:10.477 --> 00:13.514
There are some talented people
with bad leadership.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.583
That's all I'm saying.
More knockouts. Here we go.

00:16.583 --> 00:19.453
More decisions I'm not
emotionally equipped to make.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.322
Hope that a little bit
of my soul dwindles away

00:22.322 --> 00:24.825
so I can be more strong
and mean like Blake Shelton.

00:26.293 --> 00:28.729
Give it up for
our Season 21 coaches!

00:31.265 --> 00:34.535
This knockout begins
right now.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.106
Is it usually the best singer
that wins this,

00:39.106 --> 00:40.607
or is it...
It's a combination.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.142
...who captures the nation?

00:42.142 --> 00:43.710
Like, the guy that won
last season was really good,

00:43.710 --> 00:46.346
and plus he's on Team Blake.
It's hard to beat him.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.415
But Ariana, she'll throw
an interesting wild card into ‐‐

00:48.415 --> 00:50.317
It's her first year,
isn't it?
First season.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.352
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It could be interesting.

00:52.352 --> 00:54.588
Hmm. Hmm.
Mm‐hmm! Mm‐hmm!

00:54.588 --> 00:58.725
Alright, so we've got
two lovely, soulful singers,

00:58.725 --> 01:02.596
Shadale and Samara.
I could not let Samara go.

01:02.596 --> 01:07.201
John Legend uses
his one and only save!

01:07.201 --> 01:12.139
They can both really sing.
So I'm excited. Look who's here!

01:12.139 --> 01:17.211
Yo! How ya doin'?
Oh, my God.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.346
Ed Sheeran is
the perfect mega mentor.

01:19.346 --> 01:22.482
He writes his music,
he raps, he sings.

01:22.482 --> 01:25.819
Making hits after hits,
singing with Beyoncé!

01:25.819 --> 01:28.222
Shadale, you have a seat
over there.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.690
So, what did you choose?

01:29.690 --> 01:32.793
I chose "The Best"
by Tina Turner.
Tina!

01:32.793 --> 01:34.461
One of the greats
of all time.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.430
I chose it in relevance
to my mother.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.198
Whenever I sing the song,
I think of her.

01:38.198 --> 01:40.634
♪ You're simply the best

01:40.634 --> 01:44.037
My mom is my super woman,
in a way.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.607
♪ Better than all the rest

01:46.607 --> 01:49.209
Both sides of my family
are very, very religious.

01:49.209 --> 01:52.613
So coming out to her,
it took quite a while.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.816
I was nervous about telling her,
but she kind of just had

01:55.816 --> 01:58.585
this vibe of,
"I still love you just as much."

01:58.585 --> 02:01.054
And that made me feel kind of
like the world

02:01.054 --> 02:03.557
was off my shoulders, really.

02:03.557 --> 02:07.060
♪ You're the best

02:07.060 --> 02:08.362
Where does that come from?
Oh, my lord.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.732
That voice is nuts.
Those pipes. Thank you.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.367
I love the way
you're performing it.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.469
I didn't really have notes
until the key change.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.604
There was just a couple of
really, really high notes.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.273
Yeah, there were, like,
minor control issues during ‐‐

02:19.273 --> 02:21.475
Very, very minor.
Yeah.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.044
I think it's going to be
a matter of figuring out

02:24.044 --> 02:25.579
how you breathe
your way into it.

02:25.579 --> 02:30.083
Samara is a tiny little thing,
but when she starts singing,

02:30.083 --> 02:32.486
that voice is big.
She is really gifted.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.488
Whenever I go to hit high notes,
if I'm not, like,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.490
super, super confident
in the note,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.325
it always kind of wavers
a little bit.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.360
So I'd just say,
go full confidence.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.629
In my mind, I just always see it
as a little ledge.

02:42.629 --> 02:45.065
And I just go tap the ledge,
basically.
Just jump.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.067
Just jump off.
Yeah. And you can do it.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.203
It's not about her
being able to.

02:49.203 --> 02:52.172
It's about the confidence of
knowing that she can be able to.

02:52.172 --> 02:56.143
Alright, Shadale from GA.
Tell us what song you picked.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.078
I chose "Impossible"
by Shontelle.

02:58.078 --> 03:00.547
I love this song.
It's very special to me.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.482
♪ I remember years ago

03:02.482 --> 03:04.484
There was a point in my life
where my dreams

03:04.484 --> 03:06.220
did seem impossible.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.055
Growing up,
it was an unsettling feeling

03:08.055 --> 03:09.489
to see my parents struggle.

03:09.489 --> 03:13.227
We were always moving.
Eventually, we became homeless.

03:13.227 --> 03:16.496
In that time,
music was my safety blanket.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.266
This song is about being
in a situation

03:19.266 --> 03:21.068
that you thought
you would never be.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.404
♪ Impossible, impossible

03:24.404 --> 03:26.607
When I sing this song,
I think about that little girl

03:26.607 --> 03:29.710
and all the times that
I wanted to give up

03:29.710 --> 03:31.144
and I chose not to.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.381
Very good.
Alright. So dope.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.384
Is it possible
to be a little slower?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.419
It feels rushed,
like it's not allowing you

03:39.419 --> 03:40.721
to breathe in the song

03:40.721 --> 03:42.723
and, like,
let it have power, you know?

Because you can really, like,

03:49.596 --> 03:52.466
get into the soul of the song
with that. Okay, here we go.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.535
Me and Ed are gonna sing
your background vocals.

03:54.535 --> 03:58.071
Oh, please, please.

♪ Impossible

04:03.410 --> 04:05.379
Ed Sheeran and John Legend

04:05.379 --> 04:07.247
were just singing
background vocals for me

04:07.247 --> 04:08.682
while I was singing.
Like, what?

04:08.682 --> 04:10.651
Yeah!
Yeah, that's great.
So great. So great.

We need to work on
our synchronized...
Please.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.326
Shadale sounded great.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.595
She's got a real knockout
10 out of 10 with that one.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.498
This is when it starts getting
serious because the next thing

04:24.498 --> 04:27.467
that happens is the lives,
where the fans are gonna decide.

Both of them

Yeah.
That was really well done.

09:38.712 --> 09:42.583
Yes.
Samara, you have one of
my favorite voices,

09:42.583 --> 09:46.153
like how your voice opens up
and your tone is ‐‐

09:46.153 --> 09:48.055
your resonance,
everything about it.

09:48.055 --> 09:51.358
But I think I was missing
that hurt and that rasp

09:51.358 --> 09:53.327
that Tina
is so known for.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.729
But I think you have
an incredible gift.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.532
Well done.
Thank you.

09:58.532 --> 10:01.435
Shadale, it's such an important
thing in the knockouts

10:01.435 --> 10:04.304
to show us who you are
and what you're feeling,

10:04.304 --> 10:09.142
and I know,
at the very end, like... What?

10:10.644 --> 10:12.179
Hmm.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.681
Okay.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.251
I know...
Mm.

10:17.251 --> 10:19.453
Oh, my gosh.
Well, that song...

10:21.555 --> 10:26.460
It's really hard to tap
into, like, your emotions

10:26.460 --> 10:28.328
and still be able
to carry the song,

10:28.328 --> 10:31.231
and I know at the very end,
you got very emotional.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.400
It was just such
a perfect song choice,

10:33.400 --> 10:37.671
and, you know, I obviously
connected to your message and...

10:37.671 --> 10:39.540
I would go with Shadale.

10:42.176 --> 10:45.512
Samara, you know, for ‐‐ for me,
when I think of Tina Turner,

10:45.512 --> 10:48.482
this is actually one of
her happier songs, you know,

10:48.482 --> 10:51.285
so the way you performed it,
I loved it.

10:51.285 --> 10:54.555
Shadale, you came out here,
and you were doing so great,

10:54.555 --> 10:59.293
but then you went from great
into, like, exceptional.

10:59.293 --> 11:01.628
There's no denying
that we all felt it, yeah.

11:04.364 --> 11:08.202
Samara, I have been such a fan
of your voice.

11:08.202 --> 11:10.204
I've always felt
that connection feels like,

11:10.204 --> 11:12.072
"she was the one
that got away."

11:12.072 --> 11:15.142
And I love seeing you
as an artist

11:15.142 --> 11:17.044
kind of perform
how you would at a show.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.513
And I was like,
"I'll be there," you know?

11:19.513 --> 11:22.382
Mm‐hmm.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.518
Shadale,
that was so emotional.

11:24.518 --> 11:28.188
I think everybody was so,
you know, choked up

11:28.188 --> 11:30.691
by what you left
on the stage today,

11:30.691 --> 11:32.726
and it was really beautiful
and really moving,

11:32.726 --> 11:36.496
and I am such a fan
of both of you.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.366
Thank you, Coaches.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.535
Alright, John, give us some
thoughts on the knockout.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.637
Samara...

11:43.637 --> 11:47.341
I loved the soul

11:47.341 --> 11:49.476
and the sexiness
you put on the song.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.346
You were incredible,
and the only notes

11:52.346 --> 11:55.215
Ed and I had
during your rehearsal

11:55.215 --> 11:56.483
was on those high notes.

11:56.483 --> 12:00.220
I felt like you nailed them
100% today.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.689
And it was a flawless
performance.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.092
I love working with you.
Thank you.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.428
Shadale, you know,
I don't know

12:08.428 --> 12:12.599
if any of you guys have seen
Mary J. Blige in concert.

12:12.599 --> 12:16.436
I started to think about her
end of your performance

12:16.436 --> 12:18.338
because one of
the things that ‐‐

12:18.338 --> 12:19.072
Wow.
Totally.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.707
She really talks to
the audience

12:20.707 --> 12:23.210
and talks about her struggles
that she's been through,

12:23.210 --> 12:27.114
and you feel her emotion coming
through everything she does.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.683
And I think that's
what we felt today.

12:29.683 --> 12:32.319
I think, vocally,

12:32.319 --> 12:34.454
you gave your best performance
that you've given.

12:34.454 --> 12:39.092
And the thing that made it
break through was the emotion.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.561
But you're being compared
with Samara,

12:40.561 --> 12:42.729
who I think is one of the best
vocalists on this show.

12:42.729 --> 12:45.265
John, the time has come.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.600
Who is the winner
of this knockout?

12:52.372 --> 12:54.708
The winner of this knockout
is Shadale.

12:55.676 --> 12:57.377
Shadale, congratulations.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.547
You're moving on
to the live playoffs.

13:00.547 --> 13:04.251
Samara and Shadale,
this was so difficult.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.720
Shadale made every coach
feel everything

13:06.720 --> 13:08.355
she was communicating.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.057
That was beautiful.
It was really powerful.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.326
Thank you.
She won this knockout

13:12.326 --> 13:14.194
by being connected
to the song,

13:14.194 --> 13:17.731
and I'm very curious to see
how she taps into that

13:17.731 --> 13:20.601
in the following rounds.

13:20.601 --> 13:23.070
Samara, anything you want
to say to John?

13:23.070 --> 13:26.106
I've been a fan of yours
since your first album.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.574
I love you.

13:27.574 --> 13:31.378
Thank you for giving me
this opportunity.
Just thank you.

13:31.378 --> 13:35.616
Give it up one more time
for Samara Brown!

13:35.616 --> 13:37.184
You were perfect.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.720
You know, I think that's
the beautiful thing about music,

13:39.720 --> 13:42.222
is that you never know
when something's

13:42.222 --> 13:46.159
gonna hit you or move you,
and Shadale, like, shook me.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.328
Oh, my.
I thought I was
gonna go with Samara.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.464
Me, too.
She ‐‐ She made it undeniable.

13:50.464 --> 13:53.967
I was like,
"I can't talk, so..."

14:12.719 --> 14:14.521
I'm looking
at your monitor.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.722
And the side
of your head.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.291
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

14:17.291 --> 14:20.160
Do you bring your own, like,
personal eyepiece to work?

14:20.160 --> 14:23.430
You don't wanna be touching
where other people's eyes were.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.565
Yeah.

14:24.565 --> 14:26.066
So, do you always
get a couple

14:26.066 --> 14:27.467
of country artists
per season, then?

14:27.467 --> 14:29.036
Yeah, pretty much.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.537
Country ones are the ones
that do really well

14:30.537 --> 14:31.572
after the show,
though, right?

14:31.572 --> 14:33.173
Yeah, and on the show, too.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.375
They just ‐‐ Because of
the fan base, you know?

14:35.375 --> 14:38.178
So, this is, uh,
Lana and Carson.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.181
These are my two
country artists. Oh, man.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.284
We walked in, and it was
Ed Sheeran sitting there,

14:44.284 --> 14:45.786
which, uh, blew my mind.

14:45.786 --> 14:48.255
How are you?
I was just listening
to you yesterday.

14:48.255 --> 14:52.593
He works with all styles.
For him to give me feedback

14:52.593 --> 14:54.795
when he creates music
on the daily

14:54.795 --> 14:58.432
that the world falls
in love with, it's crazy.

14:58.432 --> 15:01.535
Cool. I've actually
never seen a ‐‐
The fiddle?

15:01.535 --> 15:03.570
Yeah, on this show.
That's great.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.739
One of the biggest
debates I ever got in

15:05.739 --> 15:09.176
was with Kelly Clarkson,
who insisted that

15:09.176 --> 15:14.114
a fiddle and a violin
were two different instruments.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.416
Feel like I heard a fiddle,
and that's a little bit country.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.152
Think it was
a violin, but ‐‐
Good point, Kelly.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.588
It's the exact same
instrument.
No, it's not.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.590
The difference between "strings"
and "strangs."

15:23.590 --> 15:25.659
You know that, right?
Uh...

15:25.659 --> 15:27.728
Like, when you put strings
on your records,

15:27.728 --> 15:29.596
do you put violins
or fiddles?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.598
Strings.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.166
Play it safe.
I love it.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.569
Alright, come on.

15:35.569 --> 15:37.037
For the knockouts,
I'm singing

15:37.037 --> 15:39.473
"Amarillo By Morning"
by George Strait.

15:39.473 --> 15:42.176
I picked this song
to incorporate the fiddle

15:42.176 --> 15:44.044
and to show originality.

15:44.044 --> 15:47.714
♪ Amarillo by morning

15:47.714 --> 15:50.150
My dad and I really had
a bond with music.

♪ Is just what I've got on

15:53.554 --> 15:55.289
Me and my dad
are in the bluegrass band.

15:55.289 --> 15:56.723
We've been touring
throughout the country

15:56.723 --> 15:58.425
for the last three
or four years.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.695
It's full‐circle moment for me,
listening to these artists

on national television.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.538
Yeah!

16:11.538 --> 16:14.107
Man, I wish I grew up
in the South.

16:15.576 --> 16:17.611
We just didn't have
country music in England.

16:17.611 --> 16:20.347
I discovered it when I first
came over to America.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.815
Really?
It's just beautiful.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.417
Just wonderful.
Well, thank you.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.619
You've got R&B tendencies
to your voice that are just,

16:25.619 --> 16:27.087
like, beautiful little runs

16:27.087 --> 16:29.189
that fit in so well
with country music.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.058
The more you can make
the song your own,

16:31.058 --> 16:35.128
the more you can basically shine
as an individual artist.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.431
Carson obviously
bleeds country music.

16:37.431 --> 16:40.067
He knew the fiddle part
like the back of his hand,

16:40.067 --> 16:44.037
and I can see him becoming
a really great country artist.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.372
Couple of things ‐‐
I don't feel like

16:45.372 --> 16:46.773
you totally got up
to the note.

from what George does
to take it up further.
Yep, yeah.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.083
The one take‐away from
what George Strait does is,

16:56.083 --> 16:57.784
he doesn't really
have to do a lot...
Yeah.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.419

crazy vocal things,

I love the fact that
there's a 17‐year‐old

17:13.100 --> 17:15.335
choosing this
as his knockout song.

17:15.335 --> 17:19.039
It shows you how deep
his roots run in country music.

17:19.039 --> 17:23.644
Blake, you saved me.
What about Lana?

17:27.181 --> 17:29.416
Thank you, though.
How'd you pick this song?

17:29.416 --> 17:30.651
I picked "Wildest Dreams"

17:30.651 --> 17:32.553
because I love songs
that tell stories,

17:32.553 --> 17:35.322
and not all real stories
have a happy ending.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.424
I'm actually newly single.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.725
I've had

would work on paper, too.

not working at all.

When I was in high school,
that's when "Achy Breaky Heart"

18:02.749 --> 18:04.384
and Billy Ray Cyrus
came out.
Mm‐hmm.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.653
I had a teacher that
called me "Achy Blakey."

18:06.653 --> 18:08.655
I had the mullet, too, man.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.697

Wow. That's Carson. Whoo!
That was really good.

24:38.345 --> 24:41.315
Carson, the fiddle ‐‐
that was so exciting.

24:41.315 --> 24:43.617
Energetically, it was
so beautiful, and I loved it.

24:43.617 --> 24:45.752
It was so entertaining,
and I love your voice.

24:45.752 --> 24:48.121
I'm a huge fan.
Thank you.

24:48.121 --> 24:50.290
Lana, I loved your take
on the song.

24:50.290 --> 24:53.527
You have such a gorgeous
country‐pop voice.

24:53.527 --> 24:55.796
And if I had
to help you out at all...

24:55.796 --> 24:58.165
Yes, you have to.
I know.
I'm trying here.

24:58.165 --> 25:00.200
Okay.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.669
I would definitely say
Carson today.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.438
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

25:04.438 --> 25:07.407
Carson, I love seeing you
playing the fiddle.

25:07.407 --> 25:10.577
There were just moments
when the notes needed
more breath support.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.379
Either way,
you've been so good

25:12.379 --> 25:14.214
throughout the competition.

25:15.415 --> 25:17.784
Lana, I loved
the power that you had ‐‐

25:17.784 --> 25:19.286
that piercing quality.

25:19.286 --> 25:21.488
Still have some of that
songbird in you,

25:21.488 --> 25:23.090
and it ‐‐ it really
rang through.

25:23.090 --> 25:24.791
Those notes
just cut through

25:24.791 --> 25:26.326
in a really
beautiful way.

25:26.326 --> 25:27.794
Based on
today's performances,

25:27.794 --> 25:31.431
I would pick Lana.
Thank you, John.

25:31.431 --> 25:33.066
I'll start
with you, Carson.

25:33.066 --> 25:35.469
You were a four‐chair turn,
so, obviously, we all loved you.

25:35.469 --> 25:38.172
Covering George Strait
is a big deal,

25:38.172 --> 25:39.439
and a lot of people
are used to hearing

25:39.439 --> 25:40.841
that more
laid‐back version.

25:40.841 --> 25:44.077
And yours was definitely
in your upper register,
like, most of the time.

25:44.077 --> 25:46.079
That was kind of
a little weird for me.

25:46.079 --> 25:47.614
But I think
that you're so gifted,

25:47.614 --> 25:49.416
and we're so blessed
to have you on the show.

25:49.416 --> 25:52.119
Good job.
Thank you.

25:52.119 --> 25:53.654
Hi.
Hi, Kelly.

25:53.654 --> 25:56.690
You did this thing where
you sounded like Pam Tillis

25:56.690 --> 25:58.792
in the choruses, which you're
too young for, probably.

25:58.792 --> 26:00.761
I know, though.
You have this
piercing sound

26:00.761 --> 26:02.296
kind of like Pam has

26:02.296 --> 26:04.464
where your voice cuts
right through.

26:04.464 --> 26:08.268
But the sultry stuff
you did in the verses ‐‐

26:08.268 --> 26:09.736
that was so cool.

26:09.736 --> 26:13.607
Thank you, Kelly.
That means a lot.
Thank you, Coaches.

26:13.607 --> 26:15.242
Alright, buddy,
give us some thoughts

26:15.242 --> 26:16.476
on the knockout,
and then tell us who won.

26:16.476 --> 26:19.179
Lana,
up until right now,

26:19.179 --> 26:21.215
you've kind of flown
under the radar a little bit

26:21.215 --> 26:23.150
on the show ‐‐
which, by the way,

26:23.150 --> 26:24.418
is not a bad thing.

26:24.418 --> 26:27.154
And you sounded
really good today.

26:27.154 --> 26:28.555
Like, wow.
Thank you.

26:28.555 --> 26:30.624
Carson, it's impressive
to come out here

26:30.624 --> 26:33.293
and do a George Strait song,
but that's a tall order.

26:33.293 --> 26:35.462
And, you know,
having said that, man,

26:35.462 --> 26:37.564
I think you did
everything you could do

26:37.564 --> 26:39.299
to showcase your vocals.

26:39.299 --> 26:40.601
But I have
to make a decision

26:40.601 --> 26:43.136
based on what just happened
here right now.

26:43.136 --> 26:44.738
Blake, who's the winner
of this knockout?

26:51.245 --> 26:53.380
The winner of this knockout
is Lana.

26:53.380 --> 26:55.182
Lana Scott,
congratulations!

26:55.182 --> 26:57.684
You are moving on
to the live playoffs!

26:57.684 --> 27:00.654
Carson versus Lana
is a heartbreaker for me.

27:00.654 --> 27:03.423
Lana is an incredible
country singer,

27:03.423 --> 27:06.593
and my job here is to coach
a vocalist to the finale.

27:06.593 --> 27:11.198
And I feel like Lana has
an easier path to get there

27:11.198 --> 27:13.767
than any other country singer
on the show.

27:16.103 --> 27:18.405
Oh, my gosh! Okay!
Yeah, yeah!

27:18.405 --> 27:20.440
It's actually happening.
Yeah, yeah.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.709
Carson, anything you'd like
to say to your coach?

27:22.709 --> 27:25.179
I just want to thank you guys ‐‐
uh, all four of you ‐‐

27:25.179 --> 27:26.380
for turning for me
in the blinds.

27:26.380 --> 27:27.581
You know, that was
really one of the most

27:27.581 --> 27:29.183
special moments
I've ever had.

27:29.183 --> 27:32.252
Give it up one more time
for Carson Peters!

27:34.588 --> 27:37.157
Good luck to you, brother.
Thank you, Blake.

27:37.157 --> 27:38.325
That was such
a surprise.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.660
Oh, she killed it.
Yeah, she shocked me.

27:39.660 --> 27:41.328
I thought I was gonna
go with Carson.

27:41.328 --> 27:42.629
I was like ‐‐
Both were surprises
to me.

27:42.663 --> 27:45.399
She's got a really
cool voice.
Yeah.

27:56.610 --> 27:58.178
Last day of knockouts.

27:58.178 --> 28:00.180
How's everyone feeling?
I'm feeling good.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.549
I feel like Team Legend
is...nice.

28:02.549 --> 28:04.218
Slightly under
Team Kelly.

28:04.218 --> 28:06.119
Oh, I like that face you made
when you say it, too.
Nice.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.455
I can't wait for lives.
This is our best season

28:08.455 --> 28:10.591
when it comes to depth
and breadth of talent.

28:10.591 --> 28:11.758
As a whole, yeah.
Yes.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.126
Well, we had
some good seasons

28:13.126 --> 28:14.294
before you guys were
ever here.

28:14.294 --> 28:16.363
Uh, I'm not aware.
Impossible.

28:16.363 --> 28:17.598
You guys were practicing.

28:17.598 --> 28:20.033
Until we came.

28:20.067 --> 28:21.535
Yeah.
Then you started
to really get it right.

28:21.535 --> 28:23.136
Yeah, yeah.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.806
So, next is Bella DeNapoli
and Katherine Ann.

28:25.806 --> 28:27.140
I think I paired
them together

28:27.140 --> 28:29.743
because they're both
such powerhouses.

28:31.311 --> 28:34.014
I knew it!
I told you!

28:34.014 --> 28:35.415
I love seeing
their friendship.

28:35.415 --> 28:37.451
How they entered together today
was the best thing ever.

28:37.451 --> 28:39.052
Hi! I'm great!

28:39.052 --> 28:40.721
Totally floored
and excited and honored

28:40.721 --> 28:42.456
that I'm able to sing
in front of Ed Sheeran.

28:42.456 --> 28:43.657
Grammy Award‐winner

28:43.657 --> 28:45.626
taking his time out
to listen to us?

28:45.626 --> 28:47.394
How are you two?
We're good.

28:47.394 --> 28:50.230
We're super close,
so it was, like, so exciting

28:50.230 --> 28:51.798
to know that we were gonna
get to do this together,

28:51.798 --> 28:53.667
but also, like,
so heartbreaking,

28:53.667 --> 28:55.702
because we're like,
"Mah!"

28:55.702 --> 28:58.539
Who is gonna
go first today?
I'll go first.

28:58.539 --> 29:00.407
I'm going to be singing
"Chandelier" by Sia.

These lyrics, like,
mean the absolute world to me.

29:03.744 --> 29:06.713
I remember,
I was in this dark place,

29:06.713 --> 29:09.082
and I gave up
my music career.

29:09.082 --> 29:12.519
So much of our career
has been people saying,

29:12.519 --> 29:13.720
"Get a real job."

29:13.720 --> 29:16.190
Just know that
from this point on,

You're really letting us see
your vocal ability,

30:27.761 --> 30:29.429

the first line of the chorus

30:29.429 --> 30:31.265
just needs to explode
a bit more.
Yeah.

Okay, totally.
Yeah, and I also think,
more support,

30:35.135 --> 30:38.438

will be more noticeable there

30:38.438 --> 30:39.806
because it's so high.

jaw on the floor."

Um...

38:18.597 --> 38:21.166

for me all the time,

38:21.166 --> 38:23.468
but I love that
you went and did it.

Bella, that was a really cool
rendition of "Chandelier."

38:27.439 --> 38:30.275
And when you're in
your quiet part of your voice,

38:30.275 --> 38:33.345
you do, like,
these little, tight runs,

38:33.345 --> 38:35.080
and it's really compelling.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.250
Thank you.
I would side with Bella
on this one.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.554
Bella,
I think your voice ‐‐

38:42.554 --> 38:44.623
it's like this pretty,
angelic thing,

38:44.623 --> 38:46.291
but you've got
a little edge to it.

38:46.291 --> 38:47.692
And, Katherine,
I literally looked

38:47.692 --> 38:49.528
at every person I could find,
and I was like,

38:49.528 --> 38:51.363
"She's about
to sing 'Poison!'"

38:52.597 --> 38:56.468
What you did was such
an artistic, cool move ‐‐

38:56.468 --> 38:59.404
to take a song that we all know,
like, obviously from the '90s.

38:59.404 --> 39:01.540
I grew up on that.
You made it more cinematic.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.142

towards Katherine.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.677
Thank you so much.

Was that, like, a makeout song
or something from high school?

39:10.649 --> 39:11.583
No, no.

My makeout song was ‐‐
"Achy Breaky Heart"

39:13.585 --> 39:16.488
was my makeout song.
I mean...

39:16.488 --> 39:18.590
Like, why is it such
sacred ground?

39:18.590 --> 39:20.225

39:33.672 --> 39:35.273

this is the most equal

39:38.410 --> 39:40.645

of the entire season

that much under.

I'm gonna go with Katherine,

Whitney Houston's,
like, for me,

42:56.675 --> 42:58.276
the greatest vocalist
of all time.

42:58.276 --> 43:00.278

a dude singing Whitney

is either a great decision
or a bad decision,

44:12.284 --> 44:14.252
and moved off the mic,
and we just lost you for a bit.

44:14.252 --> 44:16.121
Okay.
So I'd say just trust
the microphone.

44:16.121 --> 44:19.091
And some of the first
falsetto bits,

44:19.091 --> 44:20.659
I could tell
that you were nervous.

44:20.659 --> 44:23.428
So just trust that you got it,
'cause you have.
Yeah,

44:23.428 --> 44:27.632

conversational about it...

Thanks, man.

44:34.072 --> 44:36.408
Well, Xavier, get up here
and sing!

44:36.408 --> 44:38.076

44:38.076 --> 44:40.245

and Markéta Irglová.

44:40.245 --> 44:42.180

I ever learned on guitar.

Hi.
I love this song.
Why'd you choose it?

44:44.249 --> 44:46.218
I'm a musical theater kid.
Like, that's my whole thing.

44:46.218 --> 44:48.053
That's what I'm going
to college for.
Wow.

44:48.053 --> 44:50.055
This song represents
the kind of artist I want to be.

44:50.055 --> 44:52.457

but it's also in the
singer/songwriter vein.

and I dreamed
of being able to sing this

45:00.098 --> 45:01.433
on some big stage somewhere.

just sounds natural.
Yeah.

That's the only thing.
I love your rendition of it.

45:23.488 --> 45:26.358
And I feel like with that song,
it's not abrupt.

45:26.358 --> 45:29.194

a little bit smoother.

Yeah.

There's numbers in between.
Job well done, both of you.

46:07.365 --> 46:09.301

Wow. Jeremy,
the first quarter of the song,

51:23.715 --> 51:25.517
you were in, like,
a lower volume.

51:25.517 --> 51:28.987
It was good, but when you ramped
it up, it was incredible.

51:28.987 --> 51:31.389
The cool thing that ‐‐
that Xavier has, though,

51:31.389 --> 51:33.391
is this, like,
wild factor

51:33.391 --> 51:35.627
that's so fun
to listen to, man.

51:35.627 --> 51:37.562
You just got
a really cool tone

51:37.562 --> 51:40.098
that I think would stand out
on the radio,

51:40.098 --> 51:41.566

instantly know

that's Xavier singing

51:47.539 --> 51:49.941

stunning performance.

51:54.479 --> 51:57.582
Thank you.
And, Jeremy,
you sang Whitney Houston,

51:57.616 --> 51:59.618
which is
the tallest of orders.
Yeah.

51:59.618 --> 52:01.486
But you really brought
your own thing to it,

52:01.486 --> 52:03.321
and it was very moving.

52:03.321 --> 52:05.657
Your belt is
goose bumps everywhere.

52:05.657 --> 52:10.295
In this moment,
I think I would go with Jeremy.

it was, like, amazing,

52:18.203 --> 52:19.404

52:19.404 --> 52:21.940
Xavier, something
about your tone ‐‐

52:21.940 --> 52:23.308
it was so attractive.

52:23.308 --> 52:26.344
I‐I felt like
that was pulling me in.

52:26.344 --> 52:27.946

Give us some thoughts
on the knockout first.

52:33.118 --> 52:37.825
Jeremy, that's a big song,
but I thought it was cool

52:37.825 --> 52:39.794
that you were bold enough
to choose that song

52:39.794 --> 52:43.031
and also that it was coming from
such a masculine perspective.

52:43.031 --> 52:45.366
Thank you.
And it's interesting to know
that you're the guy

52:45.366 --> 52:47.802
that also sang Rascal Flatts
in the blinds,

52:47.802 --> 52:51.372
like, loving just anything
soulful that moves you.

52:51.372 --> 52:53.808
And I love that about you.
Thank you.

52:53.808 --> 52:57.412
Xavier, like,
way to choose a friggin' song,

52:57.412 --> 52:59.881
complemented by such
an amazing vocalist.

52:59.881 --> 53:03.318
And just how in touch you are
with your emotions is so cool.

53:03.318 --> 53:05.219
And it's interesting
'cause while you both

53:05.219 --> 53:07.021
are emotional singers,
you're very different.

53:07.021 --> 53:08.189
It's an impossible decision.

53:08.189 --> 53:09.457
Who is the winner
of this knockout?

53:09.457 --> 53:11.259
I really
am literally going,

53:11.259 --> 53:13.161
"Jeremy, Xavier, Jeremy,
Xavier."
I know, I know.

53:13.161 --> 53:16.064
Oh, no.
Oh, I can't even look at y'all.

53:16.064 --> 53:19.934
Oh.

53:19.934 --> 53:22.837
I feel like I'm gonna have to
do it on the scope

53:22.837 --> 53:28.409
of what you've shown me,
you know, so far.

53:28.409 --> 53:30.245
The winner of this knockout
is Jeremy.

53:30.245 --> 53:33.314
Jeremy Rosado,
congratulations!

53:33.314 --> 53:35.450
You're moving on
to the live playoffs.

53:35.450 --> 53:37.919
Jeremy has such a solid voice.

53:37.919 --> 53:39.187
He's just a pure vocalist,

53:39.187 --> 53:40.555
and then he wears
his heart on his sleeve.

53:40.555 --> 53:42.323
He's just kind of
that perfect artist.

53:42.323 --> 53:44.792
Ah, you did
such a great job!
Thank you so much.

53:44.792 --> 53:47.061
Moving forward, I can give him
literally any genre,

53:47.061 --> 53:48.463
and he's down for trying it.

53:48.463 --> 53:50.298
And I think that
that's really cool

53:50.298 --> 53:52.200
and ‐‐ and really strong ‐‐
a strong competitor.

53:52.200 --> 53:55.803

53:57.338 --> 53:59.407
Grateful, thankful's
not even the right word.

53:59.407 --> 54:01.910
It's beyond what I can,
like, say.

54:01.910 --> 54:03.845
Thank you, Kelly.

54:03.845 --> 54:06.781
Xavier, anything you want
to say to your coach?

54:06.781 --> 54:09.183
This whole experience has been
absolutely life‐changing,

54:09.183 --> 54:11.219
and to sing in front of you
absolute icons ‐‐

54:11.219 --> 54:12.553

good people go home.

54:17.191 --> 54:20.495
Once you get to the knockouts,
though, everyone is very good.

54:20.495 --> 54:23.531
These decisions have been tough
for all of us.

54:36.878 --> 54:38.146
Who has a steal left?

54:38.146 --> 54:39.781
You have a steal left,
right?

54:39.781 --> 54:41.449
I don't.
Who did you steal?

54:44.252 --> 54:46.054
Liar!

54:46.054 --> 54:48.323
Just waiting to
use my steal for someone

54:48.323 --> 54:49.958

54:49.958 --> 54:51.326
of anybody else
that's on my team.

54:51.326 --> 54:55.930
Alright, Berritt!
I'm so excited. I love you, man.

54:55.930 --> 54:57.932
Team Blake isn't messing around,
okay?

54:57.932 --> 54:59.801
They're actually cleaning up.

54:59.801 --> 55:01.336
So the knockouts
are brutal.

55:01.336 --> 55:03.438
Don't blow your voice out,
but keep rehearsing

55:03.438 --> 55:06.040
and keep getting
more and more comfortable,

55:06.040 --> 55:08.276
especially you
in performing aspect.
Yeah.

55:08.276 --> 55:12.247
A‐And you, don't be afraid
to attack the song vocally.

55:12.247 --> 55:14.315
Just try closing your eyes
and just get fluid with it

55:14.315 --> 55:17.151
and just feel the song.
Y'all get out of here.

this is Chris Stapleton.

kind of personality to the song.

may come out here

and pour a little more salt
in the wound,

1:21:18.070 --> 1:21:20.105

1:21:37.556 --> 1:21:40.092
Paris, I started welling up
while you were singing

1:21:40.092 --> 1:21:44.029
'cause your ability to
storytell and move everybody.

1:21:44.029 --> 1:21:46.465
I have no idea
what I would do here at all.

1:21:46.465 --> 1:21:48.333

of the show just this once?

1:21:52.971 --> 1:21:54.606
Thank you, Coaches.

1:21:54.606 --> 1:21:56.942
Alright, John, give us
some thoughts on the knockout.

1:21:56.942 --> 1:21:59.478
You all made this a dilemma
because you were

1:21:59.478 --> 1:22:03.348
just A‐plus level performers.

1:22:03.348 --> 1:22:07.986
Paris, Ed Sheeran suggested
to strip the arrangement down

1:22:07.986 --> 1:22:12.357
and let your voice
be the star. And it was.

1:22:12.357 --> 1:22:15.093
You were able to whisper
at the beginning of the song,

1:22:15.093 --> 1:22:18.630
and it was beautiful.

1:22:20.833 --> 1:22:25.971
And, Jershika,
masterclass in using

1:22:25.971 --> 1:22:27.940
the different elements
of your voice.

1:22:27.940 --> 1:22:32.778
You are an amazingly
gifted singer. Killed it, queen.

1:22:32.778 --> 1:22:35.380
And it's not fair that I have to
only choose one. It's not.

1:22:35.380 --> 1:22:39.485
Are you stalling?
No. Yes, perhaps.

1:22:39.485 --> 1:22:42.888
Well, John, this seems
like a near‐impossible decision.

1:22:42.888 --> 1:22:45.023
But who is the winner
of this knockout?

1:22:49.027 --> 1:22:53.465
The winner
of this knockout...

1:22:53.465 --> 1:22:57.035
...is Jershika.
Jershika Maple!

1:22:57.035 --> 1:23:00.806
That means you're moving on
to the live playoffs

1:23:00.806 --> 1:23:02.374

1:23:04.009 --> 1:23:06.512
You're amazing.

1:23:06.512 --> 1:23:10.883
Jershika and Paris ‐‐ Oh!
It was painful for me.

1:23:10.883 --> 1:23:12.618
But I had to pick Jershika.

1:23:12.618 --> 1:23:14.353
She deserves to go far
on this show.

1:23:14.353 --> 1:23:17.122
I could see her making it
all the way to the finale.

1:23:17.122 --> 1:23:21.527
Ahhhh!
I'm going to lives!

1:23:21.527 --> 1:23:24.630
Coaches, let me remind you that
Paris is available to steal.

1:23:24.630 --> 1:23:26.365
Paris, anything you want
to say to Coach?

1:23:26.365 --> 1:23:28.600
Truly a blessing
and an honor to be here.

1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:31.937
I thank every last one of y'all
for your input. Great job, Paris.

1:23:31.937 --> 1:23:33.972
Give it up one more time
for Paris Winningham,

1:23:33.972 --> 1:23:35.874
ladies and gentlemen!

1:23:35.874 --> 1:23:38.811
That was impossible. I'm sorry
I had to pick between you.

1:23:39.845 --> 1:23:43.081
Whoo!
Blake! Don't move!

1:23:43.081 --> 1:23:45.450
Yeah!
That's the sound
of a steal

1:23:45.450 --> 1:23:49.521
from Blake Shelton!
Yes, Blake! He got stolen! Yeah!

1:23:49.521 --> 1:23:51.824
Blake steals Paris Winningham!

1:23:53.492 --> 1:23:55.527
It's perfect that Paris ended up
on my team.

1:23:55.527 --> 1:23:57.763
He sang a country song,
for God's sakes.

1:23:57.763 --> 1:24:00.933
And moving forward,
I want to keep finding songs

1:24:00.933 --> 1:24:02.868
for him that allow him to have

1:24:02.868 --> 1:24:06.472
that kind of personality
on the stage. That was so good.

1:24:06.472 --> 1:24:08.340
That was so good.
He's so happy.

1:24:08.340 --> 1:24:12.044
I saw you have wings and a halo
when you hit the thing. Ah!

1:24:12.044 --> 1:24:13.745
I'm so excited
to go to live playoffs.

1:24:13.745 --> 1:24:16.014
I‐I get the opportunity
to really just dig deep

1:24:16.014 --> 1:24:17.483
and express myself ‐‐

1:24:17.483 --> 1:24:18.884
And work with
the best coach.

1:24:18.884 --> 1:24:20.486
You left out, "And work with
the best coach."

1:24:20.486 --> 1:24:22.654
Most definitely.
Most definitely.

1:24:22.654 --> 1:24:24.857
Before the live playoffs
kick off,

1:24:24.857 --> 1:24:26.625
each coach is nominating
one artist

1:24:26.625 --> 1:24:28.527
eliminated from the battles
or knockouts

1:24:28.527 --> 1:24:31.497
for another chance
to compete in the live shows.

1:24:31.497 --> 1:24:33.932
Now it's your turn to pick
which one will get a chance

1:24:33.932 --> 1:24:37.970
to reenter the competition.
Just tweet using #voicecomeback

1:24:37.970 --> 1:24:39.738
and an artist's first name.

1:24:39.738 --> 1:24:42.808

1:24:46.745 --> 1:24:48.680
Amazing!
