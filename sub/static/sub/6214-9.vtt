WEBVTT

00:01.337 --> 00:04.795
Jeez, louise.
It is miserable out there.

00:04.974 --> 00:07.204
Uh, yeah, but nothing takes
the chill out of your bones

00:07.376 --> 00:10.243
like a big old out-of-control
office Christmas party.

00:10.413 --> 00:12.142
Welcome, merry revelers.

00:13.983 --> 00:16.918
Okay. Well, uh, I guess the
Hanukkah party was the one to be at.

00:17.086 --> 00:18.144
But this could be fun too.

00:18.321 --> 00:19.345
Where is everyone?

00:19.522 --> 00:23.117
Well, folks at this magazine
aren't really into the office parties.

00:23.292 --> 00:24.452
Olive?

00:25.228 --> 00:26.320
Roxie, where are you going?

00:26.496 --> 00:29.556
Sabrina, the Donner Party
was better than this, with better food.

00:29.732 --> 00:33.429
Come on, we're here. You know,
we can still have a good time.

00:33.603 --> 00:35.400
There's gingerbread,
there's Christmas music,

00:35.571 --> 00:37.436
and we still have 48 minutes
on the meter.

00:37.874 --> 00:39.102
Party hearty, ladies.

00:39.275 --> 00:42.039
I'm heading off with Cole and James
to my timeshare condo

00:42.211 --> 00:43.940
for a little Christmas carousing.

00:44.580 --> 00:46.343
And, yes, we might get
a little Blitzened.

00:48.184 --> 00:50.482
Let's face it,
the holidays are a letdown.

00:50.653 --> 00:51.847
Always have been.

00:52.021 --> 00:53.420
Not for me.

00:53.589 --> 00:56.217
Christmas as a kid
was so much fun.

00:56.392 --> 00:58.622
Skating on the pond.

00:58.794 --> 01:00.762
Sipping mulled cider by the fire.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.989
Watching dad passed out
on the couch.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.259
- Too much eggnog?
- No, Mom decked him.

01:05.968 --> 01:07.868
Well, Miss Humbug,

01:08.037 --> 01:11.029
this year, the only decking
that's gonna happen is the halls.

01:11.207 --> 01:12.231
You know,

01:12.408 --> 01:14.706
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la...</i>

01:14.877 --> 01:15.901
Or, um:

01:18.147 --> 01:19.239
Stop.

01:19.415 --> 01:25.684
Boy, all this talk of Christmas carols
and eggnog, dysfunctional parents,

01:25.855 --> 01:28.119
it really makes me miss my family.

01:28.291 --> 01:30.987
Well, you know, this Christmas
we can be our own family.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.095
We'll go home and decorate the tree
and hang our stockings,

01:34.263 --> 01:36.254
and we should probably do
the Thanksgiving dishes.

01:36.432 --> 01:39.162
Well, looks like my posse
just bailed on me.

01:39.335 --> 01:42.031
Say, do you Buffalo gals
wanna come out tonight?

01:42.205 --> 01:44.400
Uh, I'm sorry,
are you inviting us to a saloon?

01:44.574 --> 01:48.476
No, I've got this condo for the holidays,
and Cole and James just bailed on me.

01:48.644 --> 01:51.772
I don't suppose you ladies would be
interested in a little winter getaway?

01:51.948 --> 01:54.246
- Condo's got a hot tub.
- That could be fun.

01:54.417 --> 01:56.783
Excuse me, Sabrina,
the last thing that we wanna do

01:56.953 --> 01:59.183
is go freeze our butts off
on some mountain.

02:00.056 --> 02:02.024
Mountain? No, no, the condo is
in Miami.

02:02.191 --> 02:03.556
- Miami?
- Florida?

02:03.726 --> 02:04.750
America?

02:05.294 --> 02:07.353
Eighty degrees and sunny.

02:08.231 --> 02:09.960
<i>Going to Miami</i>

02:10.132 --> 02:11.895

<i>We are in Miami</i>

02:54.611 --> 02:57.944
<i>We are in Miami
We are in Miami</i>

02:58.115 --> 03:01.141
Hey, ladies, I think
you got the Miami song down.

03:01.318 --> 03:03.218
Whoa, Leonard,
this place is incredible.

03:03.387 --> 03:04.684
Yeah, awesome.

03:04.855 --> 03:07.221
Thank you so much for inviting us.
It's so sweet of you.

03:07.724 --> 03:10.249
There are, uh, locks
on the bedroom doors, right?

03:10.427 --> 03:15.660
All right, you got the, uh, stereo.
You got the TV, DVD, VCR.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.425
Oh, and here's the, uh,
video collection.

03:17.601 --> 03:20.126
Be kind, rewind.

03:20.304 --> 03:22.363
Look, Roxie, nothing puts you
in a Christmassy mood

03:22.539 --> 03:24.200
<i>like It's a Wonderful Life.</i>

03:24.374 --> 03:26.899
<i>Right, but this is
"Es Una Vida Esplendida. "</i>

03:27.077 --> 03:28.101
Oh.

03:28.278 --> 03:30.269
<i>But it's still "con Jimmy Stewart. "</i>

03:30.447 --> 03:33.416
Okay, because this is a timeshare,
there's a few house rules.

03:33.584 --> 03:36.144
Uh, log all your phone calls,
don't touch the thermostat,

03:36.320 --> 03:39.414
no fluids on the furniture,
and, uh, keep out of the kitchen.

03:39.590 --> 03:42.150
Other than that, let your hair down,
enjoy yourself.

03:42.759 --> 03:44.386
Whoa, there's no pets here.

03:45.195 --> 03:47.254
Well, you could have told me
when you picked us up.

03:47.431 --> 03:49.626
What did you think I had
in the air-holed carrier?

03:49.800 --> 03:52.064
Oh, I thought
it was some feminine thing.

03:52.236 --> 03:53.794
And you needed to vent it.

03:55.472 --> 03:58.464
Sabrina, these resort condos
always have kennels for pets.

03:58.642 --> 03:59.939
Fine, I'll put him in a kennel.

04:01.311 --> 04:02.505
Salem, don't give me that look.

04:02.679 --> 04:04.909
You're the one
that talked me into bringing you.

04:05.482 --> 04:08.315
<i>Oh, I read this book,
The Cat Whisperer.</i>

04:08.485 --> 04:12.421
Well, I am going to change
and then go lounge by the pool.

04:12.589 --> 04:15.752
Which outfit would make you
flirt with me more?

04:15.926 --> 04:18.326
Well, the red one
gets my blood going.

04:18.495 --> 04:19.962
Ah, green it is.

04:21.265 --> 04:23.733
Great, this whole place
looks like Santa's village.

04:23.901 --> 04:27.359
Roxie, it's Christmastime,
in Boston, in Florida, everywhere.

04:27.538 --> 04:30.564
Well, except in parts of the Middle East
where ironically it all started.

04:31.008 --> 04:32.202
I'll just stay here and read.

04:32.376 --> 04:34.537
No, come on. Come down
to the pool and enjoy yourself.

04:34.711 --> 04:37.009
All right, but just
because it's too stuffy up here.

04:37.481 --> 04:38.948
Your warm? Hey, no problemo.

04:39.116 --> 04:40.845
Check out
this state-of-the-art ceiling fan.

04:41.018 --> 04:44.317
You got updraft, downdraft,
cross-breeze...

04:44.922 --> 04:47.288
Oh, no. Oh, no.

04:47.457 --> 04:49.254
<i>Joy to the world</i>

04:49.426 --> 04:51.326
<i>The Lord is come</i>

04:51.495 --> 04:55.556
<i>Let earth receive her king</i>

04:55.732 --> 04:58.701
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were
getting into the Christmas spirit.

04:58.869 --> 04:59.893
Maybe.

05:00.070 --> 05:02.129
You can't tell me that baritone
in the board shorts

05:02.306 --> 05:03.898
isn't bringing some joy to your world.

05:04.074 --> 05:06.440
Guys, there's going to be
a beauty contest.

05:06.610 --> 05:09.602
I may be the next
Miss Wet-Christmas.

05:09.780 --> 05:11.042
Wet-Christmas?

05:11.215 --> 05:14.275
I don't who should be more offended,
women or Irving Berlin.

05:15.352 --> 05:16.876
Huh.

05:17.054 --> 05:18.578
I thought once they tore down
that wall,

05:18.755 --> 05:20.655
there was no more Irving Berlin.

05:21.225 --> 05:24.023
You know, Morgan, I think I'm getting
Roxie into the Christmas spirit.

05:24.194 --> 05:26.560
Ooh! Speaking of which,
I forget to get her a present.

05:26.730 --> 05:28.960
Let's see what they have over here.

05:29.766 --> 05:31.199
Huh! Wow.

05:31.368 --> 05:33.734
Looks like Santa's
been summering at the gym.

05:33.904 --> 05:37.806
Hmm. Let's go see
if he's naughty or nice.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.803
Hi, I'm Morgan.

05:41.979 --> 05:44.709
Hello, Morgan.
What do you want for Christmas?

05:44.881 --> 05:49.284
Let's see,
a BMW 5 Series would be nice.

05:49.453 --> 05:50.715
Maybe some six-karat earrings...

05:52.356 --> 05:53.789
Gee, thanks.

05:53.957 --> 05:57.120
- I don't remember asking for the flu.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

05:57.294 --> 05:58.591
Is that real fur?

05:58.762 --> 06:00.923
I think Santa's allergic
to your clothes.

06:01.098 --> 06:04.124
Oh. Well, that's too bad.

06:04.301 --> 06:06.235
I'll go change.

06:06.837 --> 06:09.271
- Aren't you next?
- Uh, yeah, but, you know, I...

06:09.439 --> 06:11.270
Now that I'm up here,
I feel kind of silly.

06:11.441 --> 06:13.534
Hey, hey! Back off, sister.

06:14.811 --> 06:16.403
Have you been a good girl?

06:16.580 --> 06:21.608
Well, I gave some money to charity.
I, uh, volunteered at a shelter.

06:21.785 --> 06:24.686
Okay, in April, I looked at the answers
before I did a crossword puzzle

06:24.855 --> 06:26.083
and then I acted all smart.

06:26.256 --> 06:27.951
Why don't you
take a break, sweetie?

06:28.125 --> 06:31.959
Maybe some guys wanna sit
on Mrs. Claus' lap.

06:32.129 --> 06:33.858
Sabrina, do you have any?

06:34.031 --> 06:35.055
Oh, my God.

06:36.433 --> 06:38.162
- Mom.
- Mom?

06:39.202 --> 06:44.367
Aw, sweetheart,
it's so good to see you.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.736
Why didn't you tell me
you were out of prison?

06:46.910 --> 06:49.674
I'm guessing Hallmark
doesn't make a card for that occasion.

06:49.846 --> 06:54.112
Uh, listen, I wanted to get back
on my feet before I saw you, so...

06:54.284 --> 06:57.811
Zack and I took this job playing Santa
at all the resorts.

06:58.488 --> 07:00.649
Oh, meet Zack, my boyfriend.

07:00.824 --> 07:02.121
Nice to meet you.

07:02.292 --> 07:05.420
I'm crazy about your mom.
She stole my heart.

07:05.595 --> 07:06.857
And then she pawned it, right?

07:07.030 --> 07:10.989
Whoa. Oh, two Santa's in one family?
I mean, what are the odds?

07:11.168 --> 07:14.729
Roxie, you have every right
to feel the way you do about me.

07:14.905 --> 07:17.066
But I've changed, I really have.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.708
Right, and the check's in the mail
and the dog ate my homework

07:19.876 --> 07:22.276
and apple-cinnamon candles
make a great gift.

07:22.446 --> 07:24.971
Roxie?
- That didn't go the way I hoped.

07:25.148 --> 07:26.945
Well, she's just kind of shocked
to see you.

07:27.117 --> 07:29.642
At least now you know not to get her
an apple-cinnamon candle.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.913
No, I can't blame her.

07:32.089 --> 07:34.990
I was really a pretty lousy mother.

07:35.592 --> 07:37.287
Don't worry, I'll talk to her.

07:37.461 --> 07:40.294
You know, by this time tomorrow
you guys will be swapping outfits.

07:40.464 --> 07:43.297
Well, maybe not that outfit.

07:43.467 --> 07:45.867
Be a good kitty and keep quiet.

07:46.970 --> 07:49.632
We don't cotton to troublemakers
around here.

07:53.110 --> 07:54.805
- Hi.
- Oh.

07:54.978 --> 07:56.843
Hey, look who
dropped by unexpectedly.

07:57.013 --> 07:58.981
It's Candy,
who paid her debt to society

07:59.149 --> 08:01.344
and is trying to win back
the affection of her daughter

08:01.518 --> 08:03.918
- during this most forgiving of seasons.
- Sabrina.

08:04.087 --> 08:06.112
Well, hello there.
Welcome to my crib.

08:06.289 --> 08:08.189
Oh, thank you. It's very nice.

08:08.358 --> 08:10.724
Well, make yourself comfortable,
but don't touch anything.

08:13.230 --> 08:16.358
I'm losing the sun on the balcony.
I'm going back down to the pool.

08:16.533 --> 08:17.761
Oh, hi.

08:17.934 --> 08:21.165
- Are the Rockettes playing here?
- No, no, this is Candy, Roxie's mom.

08:22.139 --> 08:25.074
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

08:25.242 --> 08:26.300
Listen, I'm a designer

08:26.476 --> 08:29.206
and I'd be glad to put together
a new look for you.

08:29.379 --> 08:31.540
You know, now that you're out
of "the big house. "

08:33.015 --> 08:35.985
We'll stay away
from stripes and jump suits.

08:36.153 --> 08:37.586
You must be Morgan.

08:37.754 --> 08:39.517
And I must be going.

08:39.688 --> 08:43.022
The sun waits for no man.

08:45.262 --> 08:47.730
You know what,
I think I'm gonna go down to the pool.

08:47.898 --> 08:50.731
Oh, come on, Roxie.
Stay and talk to your mom.

08:50.901 --> 08:53.995
Sorry, it's just not the same without
two phones and a Plexiglas window.

08:55.038 --> 08:56.903
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>

08:57.073 --> 08:58.597
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas...</i>

08:58.775 --> 09:01.369
Hey, how about that?
Room service delivers holiday cheer.

09:01.545 --> 09:04.946
I get the feeling
she's trying to avoid me.

09:05.115 --> 09:07.481
Funny, I didn't know
you had feelings.

09:07.651 --> 09:08.675
<i>- merry Christmas</i>

09:08.852 --> 09:10.479
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>

09:10.654 --> 09:12.485
Come on, Roxie, it's Christmas.

09:12.656 --> 09:14.749
This is the perfect time
to work things out.

09:14.925 --> 09:17.018
Sabrina, why is this
so important to you?

09:17.194 --> 09:18.218
You wanna know why?

09:18.395 --> 09:21.057
Because your mom's family
and at least she's here.

09:21.231 --> 09:22.892
Some of us don't have that, Roxie.

09:23.066 --> 09:24.658
I have great Christmas memories
of my mom,

09:24.835 --> 09:27.099
but, unfortunately,
I can't be with her right now.

09:27.270 --> 09:30.433
Don't you get it? Mom's the reason
I'm trying to block out the holiday.

09:30.607 --> 09:34.304
Wait, sweetheart, please,
come here and sit down.

09:34.478 --> 09:36.002
Come on.

09:38.582 --> 09:40.709
Is this about the used gifts again?

09:40.884 --> 09:42.215
It wasn't just the gifts.

09:42.385 --> 09:44.649
Do you realize we never even had
a real Christmas?

09:44.821 --> 09:48.154
Other families went ice skating
or sipped mulled cider.

09:48.325 --> 09:49.656
Ooh! We don't have mulled cider,

09:49.826 --> 09:52.659
but the last tenants left
a bottle of grape juice that's going bad.

09:52.829 --> 09:56.390
Sweetheart, what did you expect?

09:56.566 --> 09:58.329
Your dad up and left me.

09:58.502 --> 10:01.266
I was scrimping
just to make ends meet.

10:01.438 --> 10:04.373
Mom, look up scrimping.
It doesn't involve high-speed chases.

10:04.541 --> 10:06.031
Goodbye.

10:07.410 --> 10:09.139
<i>- and a happy New Year</i>

10:09.312 --> 10:10.336
<i>Good tidings...</i>

10:10.514 --> 10:12.573
You know, that song has 11 verses.

10:12.749 --> 10:15.684
So you might as well stay
and work things out.

10:15.852 --> 10:18.582
It's never too late to start to make
good Christmas memories.

10:18.755 --> 10:21.952
- Leonard, let's go down to the pool.
- No, I still gotta work on the fan.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.389
<i>Ah, the gift shop is selling
Miami Vice action figures.</i>

10:24.561 --> 10:26.995
- Hmm, I did break my Crockett.
- Okay.

10:27.597 --> 10:30.361
All right, well, you know,
you guys just give it a try.

10:30.534 --> 10:33.162
Go back to the beginning
and try to hash it out.

10:33.336 --> 10:36.828
But just don't go back too far.
This is a timeshare.

10:38.241 --> 10:40.402
Hey, what happened to the...

10:40.577 --> 10:41.601
<i>- your kin</i>

10:41.778 --> 10:45.612
<i>Good tidings for Christmas
And a happy New Year</i>

10:48.151 --> 10:50.176
And now
our costume competition continues

10:50.353 --> 10:53.151
with Contestant Number 8,
Morgan Cavanaugh.

10:56.359 --> 10:58.327
Cute getup, babe,
but what's the Christmas theme?

10:59.229 --> 11:01.220
I'm Vixen.

11:02.332 --> 11:04.266
I'm looking for a nice gift
for my friend.

11:04.434 --> 11:08.165
You know, something earthy, organic,
but definitely not apple cinnamon.

11:08.338 --> 11:10.329
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Oh, hey, Roxie.

11:10.507 --> 11:12.634
I'm just looking for a gift for myself.

11:12.809 --> 11:14.902
Uh, you know,
because I'm worth it, darn it. Ha, ha.

11:15.078 --> 11:17.774
- How did things go with your mom?
- We talked things out.

11:17.948 --> 11:21.384
Actually, we yelled things out,
but it ended really well.

11:21.551 --> 11:23.485
And for once
when she hugged me goodbye,

11:23.653 --> 11:25.416
it wasn't to use me
as a human shield.

11:25.589 --> 11:29.685
Hey, a human shield
is just a hug facing out.

11:29.859 --> 11:30.951
Well, I better hit the hay.

11:31.127 --> 11:33.322
I need my beauty sleep
for the finals tomorrow.

11:33.496 --> 11:36.056
Yeah, I need a shower,
rinse off some of this chlorine.

11:36.232 --> 11:38.393
You guys go on. I'm gonna pick out
a present for my mom.

11:38.568 --> 11:40.331
Hey, thanks for helping us
patch things up.

11:41.338 --> 11:43.499
I thought it was impossible,
but you made it happen.

11:45.609 --> 11:47.770
You know, that's what
the Christmas spirit is all about.

11:47.944 --> 11:50.208
It's about helping people,
not presents.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.143
But in case you're looking,
I'm a Size 2.

11:52.315 --> 11:54.613
You brokered a reunion
between Roxie and her mother?

11:55.685 --> 11:57.949
- I am impressed.
- Yeah.

11:58.421 --> 12:01.447
They should send you to work out
that whole Midwest crisis.

12:01.625 --> 12:04.753
It's useless, Morgan. The Dakotas
will never get back together.

12:09.466 --> 12:12.458
This poster has never been put
to better use.

12:12.636 --> 12:15.434
Don't worry, fellas,
I'll contact Bob Barker.

12:15.605 --> 12:17.163
He'll get you out of here.

12:24.648 --> 12:26.878
Time to mellow out.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.712
I'll put on some
Luther Vandross and...

12:29.886 --> 12:32.013
Oh, my God.

12:33.023 --> 12:35.719
Everything is gone.

12:35.892 --> 12:38.053
What happened?

12:38.895 --> 12:41.728
I think maybe Roxie's mom
stole Christmas.

12:46.204 --> 12:47.728
You know,
I must have misjudged Candy.

12:47.905 --> 12:50.100
She seemed like she wanted
to turn over a new leaf.

12:50.274 --> 12:52.799
Instead she turned over
the whole condo.

12:52.977 --> 12:56.572
Well, don't just stand there, Leonard.
Start videotaping what was stolen.

12:57.982 --> 13:00.075
You know, Sabrina,
this is all your fault.

13:00.251 --> 13:04.620
No smoking, no pets, no felons.

13:04.789 --> 13:05.983
We should call the police.

13:06.157 --> 13:08.717
Wait, wait, wait.
Roxie's gonna be devastated.

13:08.893 --> 13:11.327
Maybe I can get our stuff back
before Roxie finds out.

13:11.496 --> 13:14.761
I think she'll catch on when she has
to brush her teeth with her finger.

13:14.932 --> 13:16.593
I've gotta go talk to Candy.

13:16.768 --> 13:18.668
- Hey, guys, what's new?
- Not a thing.

13:18.836 --> 13:21.896
The food at the midnight buffet.

13:22.073 --> 13:23.131
But it's only, like, 11.

13:23.307 --> 13:25.241
Then we can be there
when the countdown starts

13:25.410 --> 13:27.207
for the giant cheese ball to drop.

13:31.048 --> 13:33.175
Sabrina, the food
hasn't even been put out yet.

13:33.351 --> 13:37.310
Or someone got their money's worth
out of the all-you-can-eat buffet.

13:38.723 --> 13:40.953
Ooh. Okay, you go distract Roxie.

13:41.125 --> 13:42.615
Okay. How?

13:42.794 --> 13:44.625
Haven't you ever
distracted anyone before?

13:44.796 --> 13:46.787
Well, yeah, but I don't think
she's gonna fall for

13:46.964 --> 13:48.693
the "Oops, my strap broke" trick.

13:48.866 --> 13:50.128
Eh, it's worth a shot.

13:50.301 --> 13:51.928
Now, Leonard...

13:53.871 --> 13:57.932
All I want to know is where were you
between the hours of?

13:58.109 --> 13:59.804
I don't know
because you stole my watch too.

13:59.977 --> 14:01.103
This is ridiculous.

14:01.279 --> 14:04.578
Your boyfriend here is accusing me
of ripping off your condo.

14:05.349 --> 14:08.409
Well, we'll get back to the disturbing
boyfriend comment in a minute,

14:08.586 --> 14:09.917
but our condo was robbed.

14:10.087 --> 14:12.453
You're calling me a thief?

14:12.623 --> 14:15.183
How about, um,
merchandise relocation engineer?

14:15.693 --> 14:17.285
Come on,
when you were up there earlier,

14:17.462 --> 14:19.362
I saw you eyeing my humidifier.

14:19.530 --> 14:22.260
It was a graduation present
and I want it back.

14:22.733 --> 14:24.701
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, nothing.

14:24.869 --> 14:27.895
I'm just having a nightcap
and being falsely accused.

14:28.072 --> 14:30.563
Your friends think that your mom
ripped off your condo.

14:30.741 --> 14:32.436
Wait, now you're putting words
in my mouth.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.942
By coincidence, they're the very words
I was gonna use.

14:35.112 --> 14:39.640
Roxie, I swear, I didn't steal anything.
I don't do that anymore.

14:39.817 --> 14:43.810
Well, Mom, it's just like old times.
Thanks for disappointing me again.

14:45.556 --> 14:48.047
I hope you're satisfied.

14:49.293 --> 14:51.693
Yeah, nice going.

14:51.863 --> 14:54.024
What is this,
walk-away-from-Sabrina night?

14:54.198 --> 14:58.897
I'm just curious, why would
that boyfriend comment be disturbing?

14:59.070 --> 15:00.503
Not the right time, gotcha.

15:00.671 --> 15:02.832
Leonard, maybe I was wrong.
I was just trying to help,

15:03.007 --> 15:05.498
but now Roxie hates Candy.
Candy hates me.

15:05.676 --> 15:08.873
Yep, I've managed to destroy
Christmas for just about everybody.

15:09.046 --> 15:10.536
<i>Oh, bring us a figgy pudding</i>

15:10.715 --> 15:11.739
<i>Oh, bring us a figgy...</i>

15:11.916 --> 15:14.646
For crying out loud,
learn another song!

15:18.789 --> 15:20.882
Salem, what are you doing here?

15:21.058 --> 15:22.889
I busted out of that kennel.

15:23.060 --> 15:26.188
- They treated us like animals.
- I'm sorry I had to put you in there.

15:26.364 --> 15:28.992
If it's any consolation, things aren't
good on the outside, either.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.190
We were robbed.

15:30.368 --> 15:31.835
Robbed? Who did it?

15:32.003 --> 15:35.564
I don't know, but it would be cool if it
was Roxie's mom since I accused her.

15:35.740 --> 15:38.709
I'll help you solve the crime
if you let me stay here.

15:39.243 --> 15:41.803
Fine, but you have to hide
when Leonard's around.

15:41.979 --> 15:44.641
- Cat dander gives him a body rash.
- Deal.

15:44.815 --> 15:47.147
So, Detective Spellman,
maybe we should use

15:47.318 --> 15:51.311
what psychic investigators
call "retrocognition. "

15:51.489 --> 15:55.084
Or we could use what witches call
"going back in time to see who did it. "

15:55.593 --> 15:59.120
Okay, let's see what was going on here
a few hours ago.

15:59.964 --> 16:02.797
Ooh, it's a good thing
I learned how to drive stick.

16:05.937 --> 16:07.928
I think you went back a little too far.

16:08.105 --> 16:10.005
Relax, Salem, they're herbivores.

16:10.174 --> 16:13.405
Well, then throw them someone
named Herb and let's get out of here.

16:17.048 --> 16:19.209
Okay, now we're closer.

16:19.584 --> 16:22.018
Uh, should I hide?

16:22.186 --> 16:26.054
Okay. Let's get out of here
before he pulls a full Leonard.

16:28.259 --> 16:29.283
Is he gone?

16:29.460 --> 16:31.291
All clear, and we're here.

16:33.030 --> 16:34.827
I think we have our culprit.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.762
It's Oscar De La Hoya.

16:39.470 --> 16:40.494
It's Zack.

16:40.671 --> 16:43.037
And he's taking Leonard's TV.

16:43.207 --> 16:46.335
He's stealing the VCR and the DVD?

16:46.510 --> 16:48.603
The stereo with the MP3.

16:48.779 --> 16:52.681
Why, that rotten old Zack
even stole the tp.

16:53.584 --> 16:56.485
<i>Keep that up and you're gonna be
The Cat in the Hat Went Splat.</i>

16:57.021 --> 17:00.650
Cheer up, you got your criminal.
Mystery solved.

17:00.825 --> 17:01.849
It's not that simple.

17:02.293 --> 17:05.126
I can't exactly tell Roxie
how I know Zack did it.

17:05.296 --> 17:07.230
I have to show her proof.

17:07.397 --> 17:09.695
Yeah, good luck.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.665
Tell me what you think of this plan.
I just came up with it.

17:12.837 --> 17:15.806
<i>Well, actually, I saw it
on an old episode of Columbo.</i>

17:15.973 --> 17:17.838
As soon as the judges
tally up their results,

17:18.009 --> 17:20.272
we'll have our new
Miss Wet-Christmas.

17:24.115 --> 17:26.481
- How did I do?
- I have to hand it to you.

17:26.651 --> 17:29.381
I never thought gargling was a talent,
but you really pulled it off.

17:29.553 --> 17:31.248
It's a gift.

17:31.422 --> 17:34.550
I tell you what, why don't I videotape
you when they announce the winner?

17:34.725 --> 17:38.718
Oh, darn, I left
the video camera upstairs.

17:38.896 --> 17:42.923
Sabrina, we have one thing that isn't
stolen and you leave it in the room?

17:43.100 --> 17:44.761
Tell you what, you know what,
if you win,

17:44.935 --> 17:47.233
I'll go get the video camera.
We'll reenact your victory.

17:47.405 --> 17:51.068
Okay, but I get final approval
on who plays me.

17:52.843 --> 17:55.038
Hey, Candy, where's Zack?

17:55.212 --> 17:57.908
Why? You got something
you wanna blame him for?

17:58.082 --> 17:59.845
Just come with me. Roxie, you too.

18:00.017 --> 18:01.541
- What's going on?
- You'll see.

18:01.719 --> 18:03.550
Hey, Leonard, you wanna help me
nab the perp?

18:03.721 --> 18:05.621
I'll come with you,
but I'm not gonna be part of

18:05.790 --> 18:08.759
your whole crime-fighting
SWAT-team shtick.

18:08.926 --> 18:10.086
Freeze, scuzzball.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.456
So, what's the big revelation?

18:14.265 --> 18:17.063
I don't get it. I thought for sure
he'd come to steal the video camera.

18:17.234 --> 18:19.225
- Who, Zack?
- Zack?

18:19.403 --> 18:20.427
Are you kidding me?

18:20.604 --> 18:22.731
Zack is one of the most decent men
I've ever met.

18:26.544 --> 18:28.876
- Oh, stupid cat.
- Ah, here's your proof.

18:29.046 --> 18:31.139
I don't believe this.
This is an invasion.

18:31.315 --> 18:32.475
I feel totally violated.

18:32.650 --> 18:34.515
How could you bring that cat
back in here?

18:34.685 --> 18:36.448
Uh, Leonard, bigger issues?

18:38.522 --> 18:43.755
You actually let them think
that I did it?

18:43.928 --> 18:46.624
You can't treat my mom like this.
She's way too good for you.

18:46.797 --> 18:48.992
Oh, come on.
She's just bitter that I beat her to it.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.997
Wrong, loser.
She's through with that life.

18:51.168 --> 18:53.466
Yeah, and I'm through with you.

18:54.271 --> 18:56.432
Look at this,
the two of you side-by-side

18:56.607 --> 18:59.007
intimidating some creep
who stole all our stuff.

18:59.176 --> 19:00.734
This is what Christmas is all about.

19:00.911 --> 19:03.539
All right, all right,
I'll give you back your stuff.

19:06.417 --> 19:07.907
<i>We won't go until we get some</i>

19:08.085 --> 19:10.645
<i>We won't go until we get some
We won't...</i>

19:11.355 --> 19:13.346
I'm guessing they won't go
until they get some,

19:13.524 --> 19:15.822
so, uh, anybody got some?

19:21.132 --> 19:22.497
You know, nothing says
Christmas Eve

19:22.666 --> 19:25.499
like warming my toes
in front of a picture of a fire.

19:25.669 --> 19:27.261
I propose a toast.

19:27.438 --> 19:29.963
To Sabrina,
who restored my good name.

19:30.141 --> 19:31.165
To Sabrina.

19:31.342 --> 19:33.936
And to a condo
filled with attractive babes.

19:35.112 --> 19:37.478
I'm not helping myself, am I?

19:37.648 --> 19:39.548
Oh, and to our new
Miss Wet-Christmas.

19:40.618 --> 19:42.518
Sorry we didn't videotape you
being crowned.

19:42.686 --> 19:44.551
Oh, that's okay.
I wasn't actually crowned.

19:45.089 --> 19:48.547
Is this more like the kind of Christmas
you were thinking about, sweetheart?

19:48.726 --> 19:49.954
Yeah, kind of.

19:50.127 --> 19:52.561
But being in Florida,
it doesn't really feel like Christmas.

19:57.501 --> 19:59.128
Hey, look, it's snowing.

19:59.303 --> 20:00.327
- What?
- Snowing?

20:00.504 --> 20:01.971
- No way.
Are you kidding?

20:02.139 --> 20:06.303
Oh, my God, it is snowing.

20:06.477 --> 20:09.446
You know how you've always wanted
to go ice skating with your mom?

20:09.613 --> 20:10.671
Look, the pool's frozen.

20:10.848 --> 20:12.782
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>

20:12.950 --> 20:14.076
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>

20:14.251 --> 20:18.085
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year</i>

20:18.255 --> 20:20.780
<i>Good tidings we bring
To you and your kin</i>

20:20.958 --> 20:23.825
Now, that is the very picture
of Christmas.

20:23.994 --> 20:26.588
Watching them makes we wanna do
something Christmassy.

20:26.764 --> 20:28.823
You know, we haven't tried
the hot tub yet.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.233
Tell you what, Leonard,
when that freezes over, count me in.

20:32.403 --> 20:34.200
<i>Good tidings on Christmas</i>

20:34.371 --> 20:35.861
<i>And a happy New Year</i>

20:37.843 --> 20:40.869
You know, Roxie, I still feel bad
I never had time to buy you a present.

20:41.046 --> 20:42.479
You gave me the best present ever:

20:42.648 --> 20:44.741
The chance to go ice skating
with my mom.

20:45.517 --> 20:48.008
Oh, actually,
that was from both of us.

20:48.187 --> 20:50.348
Oh, guys, I almost forgot.
Leonard sent us a card.

20:50.522 --> 20:51.955
I get dibs on any cash.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.092
Oh, it's a bill.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.060
"Crumbs on the carpet, $12.

20:57.229 --> 20:59.527
Failure to rewind yule log, $9.

20:59.698 --> 21:02.132
Rubbing lotion on Morgan,
priceless. "

21:05.504 --> 21:11.773
<i>And a happy New Year</i>
