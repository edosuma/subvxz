00:07.081 --> 00:09.084
<i>Previously on The Affair...</i>

00:09.085 --> 00:10.521
I don't want your help, Helen.

00:10.522 --> 00:12.925
I told you that. I can make it nine months.

00:12.926 --> 00:14.595
<i>I don't know how to fix it.</i>

00:14.596 --> 00:16.431
<i>I don't need you to fix things.</i>

00:16.432 --> 00:18.002
<i>Why are you still visiting him?</i>

00:18.003 --> 00:19.170
He made some mistakes.

00:19.171 --> 00:21.108
Some mistakes? He's a murderer!

00:21.109 --> 00:23.479
Just because he was convicted
doesn't mean he's guilty.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.149
- Helen.
- Is Noah here?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.788
Who was driving the car
that killed Scott Lockhart?

00:27.789 --> 00:29.357
As far as I know, Noah was.

00:29.358 --> 00:31.128
He basically stood up in that court,

00:31.129 --> 00:33.500
and he volunteered to go to prison.

00:37.474 --> 00:39.377
Well, it's really
great to finally meet you, Vik.

00:39.378 --> 00:41.181
Well, I'm happy
to meet you guys, too.

00:41.182 --> 00:44.254
Anyone would be an improvement
after your first husband.

00:44.255 --> 00:46.659
So how is Noah? Do
they know who stabbed him?

00:46.660 --> 00:48.495
- Where were you?
- I was with Dad.

00:48.496 --> 00:50.232
- Where?
- At the lake house.

00:50.233 --> 00:53.205
<i>At Grandpa's
house in Pennsylvania?</i>

00:53.206 --> 00:55.544
- Stop!
- Noah!

00:55.545 --> 00:57.615
I need help.

00:59.853 --> 01:01.321
<i>Will you lie down?</i>

01:01.322 --> 01:02.825
<i>'Cause you really
need to get some rest.</i>

01:02.826 --> 01:04.662
You let Dad back in this house!

01:04.663 --> 01:05.831
Shh! Lower your voice!

01:05.832 --> 01:07.166
He's right down there.

01:07.167 --> 01:10.339
Why do you hate yourself so much?

01:11.844 --> 01:13.813
I don't.

01:13.814 --> 01:15.684
You lied to me, repeatedly.

01:15.685 --> 01:17.487
I know. It was wrong, but I can fix it.

01:17.488 --> 01:19.525
And then what? Fuck!

01:19.526 --> 01:21.729
- Please...
- Just tell me the truth.

01:21.730 --> 01:23.500
Are you still in love with him?

01:23.501 --> 01:26.005
No.

01:28.043 --> 01:30.847
Merlin is an
archetype for the war.

01:30.848 --> 01:32.250
Between one's conscious mind

01:32.251 --> 01:35.122
and its self-destructive
subconscious desire,

01:35.123 --> 01:37.060
we see the fictional shadow self

01:37.061 --> 01:38.730
<i>become a manifestation</i>

01:38.731 --> 01:41.034
<i>of the writer's own depravity.</i>

01:44.943 --> 01:47.548
<i>Detective Stanton, I
think I know who attacked me.</i>

01:47.549 --> 01:49.284
<i>He's been following
me since I got out.</i>

01:50.955 --> 01:53.225
<i>He's a guard
at Fishkill named...</i>

01:53.226 --> 01:54.929
John Gunther.

01:58.002 --> 01:59.404
Hey, wait. What are you doing? Come here.

01:59.405 --> 02:00.841
- No...
- This is exciting.

02:00.842 --> 02:02.243
Come on, John, it's just a story.

02:02.244 --> 02:04.380
It's Gunther!

02:04.381 --> 02:07.253
I want to ask you a question.

02:07.254 --> 02:09.257
What did you do?

02:11.195 --> 02:12.564
<i>Are you John's mother?</i>

02:12.565 --> 02:14.568
They just moved over to Hughsonville.

02:14.569 --> 02:18.576
His wife got a job at a
little hair salon there.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.081
What do you want?

02:21.082 --> 02:22.450
<i>What do you want?</i>

02:28.798 --> 02:30.934
Did you see him? Is he gone?

02:30.935 --> 02:32.069
See who?

02:36.814 --> 02:39.484
- I know you.
- You don't know me.

02:39.485 --> 02:42.759
Aah, no, Noah!

04:48.076 --> 04:49.645

05:06.746 --> 05:08.216
Where's Vik?

05:21.475 --> 05:23.278
Everybody pack your stuff.

05:23.279 --> 05:25.082
We're going to the beach.

05:29.826 --> 05:32.429
- Stop kicking my seat.
- I'm not!

05:32.430 --> 05:35.302
- Somebody is.
- I'm not.

06:32.384 --> 06:35.890
Yoo-hoo!

06:35.891 --> 06:37.326
Hi, Grandma. How are you?

06:37.327 --> 06:39.363
Fine, sweetie. And you?

06:39.364 --> 06:41.067
- Good.
- Trevor!

06:41.068 --> 06:43.371
Early start, Grandpa?

06:43.372 --> 06:45.175
Hey, I'll have one of those.

06:45.176 --> 06:46.979
Don't be such a wise guy.

06:46.980 --> 06:48.214
Where's Vik? He didn't come?

06:48.215 --> 06:50.018
No, he's on call.

06:50.019 --> 06:51.855
Did you guys fix the Xbox yet?

06:51.856 --> 06:53.258
- Trevor...
- What?

06:53.259 --> 06:54.695
Forget the Xbox.

06:54.696 --> 06:56.397
I got a good book for you to read.

06:56.398 --> 06:58.335
A book?

06:58.336 --> 06:59.905
I'm good with that.

06:59.906 --> 07:01.341
- Nice jacket.
- Thank you.

07:01.342 --> 07:02.644
Keep you warm.

07:57.120 --> 08:01.327
Ignore her. It's her new thing.

08:01.328 --> 08:03.431
Come, Helen. Join me on the mat.

08:03.432 --> 08:05.435
No, thank you.

08:05.436 --> 08:09.210
Pumpkin, I was very impressed
by that doctor of yours.

08:09.211 --> 08:10.947
You know he paid our dinner bill?

08:10.948 --> 08:13.886
Slipped the waiter his card
when we weren't looking.

08:13.887 --> 08:17.125
Now, that is a very specific kind of class.

08:17.126 --> 08:19.296
And after
dinner, I told your father...

08:19.297 --> 08:22.236
I said to him, that's the
man she's going to marry.

08:22.237 --> 08:23.639
Ha! God help him.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.242
Does he practice yoga?

08:25.243 --> 08:27.780
He looks like the kind of
person who would practice yoga.

08:27.781 --> 08:29.584
- Mom.
- What?

08:29.585 --> 08:32.924
He has great energy and a very strong core.

08:37.967 --> 08:39.905
Next to the refrigerator.

08:41.341 --> 08:43.178
Advil, right?

08:45.851 --> 08:47.921
Is Vik joining
us for dinner tonight?

08:47.922 --> 08:49.456
Tell him he has to.

08:49.457 --> 08:51.595
We'll eat later, if that's better.

08:51.596 --> 08:54.199
He can catch the 5:18 or even the 6:10.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.337
Vik left me.

08:56.338 --> 08:57.641
What?

09:00.948 --> 09:03.620
Come here, honeybunch.

09:09.130 --> 09:10.967
Breathe, sweetheart.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.169
- Breathe.
- I am breathing.

09:12.170 --> 09:13.806
Did he give you a good reason?

09:13.807 --> 09:16.979
You explained to him
about your moods, right?

09:16.980 --> 09:19.483
He has to understand that Helen today

09:19.484 --> 09:20.987
is not the same as Helen tomorrow.

09:20.988 --> 09:23.091
I really don't want to talk about this.

09:23.092 --> 09:25.596
Believe me, I understand
how you might feel that way.

09:25.597 --> 09:27.800
But it isn't healthy to
keep it all bottled up.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.138
Your mother's right.

09:30.139 --> 09:31.775
We're here to help you, Helen.

09:31.776 --> 09:33.880
Didn't ask for your help.

09:36.653 --> 09:37.987
What is that look?

09:37.988 --> 09:39.223
What are you doing? What is that?

09:39.224 --> 09:41.628
The time has come for honesty, honey.

09:41.629 --> 09:42.997
You're falling apart.

09:42.998 --> 09:45.235
You've been a wreck for a long time now.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.205
But the truth is, it's our fault.

09:47.206 --> 09:48.709
- What?
- We admit it.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.011
We failed you as parents.

09:50.012 --> 09:51.581
Your mother and I...

09:51.582 --> 09:53.084
we've been seeing a therapist.

09:53.085 --> 09:55.255
He has made us see everything
so much more clearly,

09:55.256 --> 09:58.762
and now we realize how
utterly responsible we are

09:58.763 --> 10:00.833
for how disastrously
your life has turned out.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.870
We want you to know we're here for you now,

10:02.871 --> 10:04.574
for whatever you need...

10:04.575 --> 10:07.045
vacation, money, counseling.

10:07.046 --> 10:09.884
You're a good person, Helen,

10:09.885 --> 10:12.757
despite your upbringing, and none of it...

10:12.758 --> 10:15.261
<i>none of it is your fault.</i>

10:15.262 --> 10:17.600
Okay, thank you. Thanks.

10:17.601 --> 10:19.204
Thank you.

10:22.578 --> 10:25.216
Kids, let's get some lunch!

10:53.205 --> 10:54.440
Can I pay?

11:06.464 --> 11:08.401
Is that Mrs. Lockhart?

11:08.402 --> 11:10.405
Yeah, Cole's mom makes
these pies out of her house.

11:10.406 --> 11:13.144
They're delicious.

11:13.145 --> 11:15.448
Can I have three?

11:28.475 --> 11:30.378
More cauliflower, anyone?

11:30.379 --> 11:33.852
It's roasted in coconut oil.

11:33.853 --> 11:37.192
Hey, Sparky, your queen is dead, remember?

11:37.193 --> 11:38.662
Not anymore. I brought her back.

11:38.663 --> 11:40.164
I use it on everything.

11:40.165 --> 11:42.235
It does wonders for your hair, your nails,

11:42.236 --> 11:44.039
your digestion, your immunity.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.509
Helen, please tell your son

11:45.510 --> 11:47.546
how we feel about cheating in this family.

11:47.547 --> 11:50.018
I'm not cheating. I
got a pawn to your last row.

11:50.019 --> 11:52.857
Since when did you become
such a chess expert?

11:52.858 --> 11:54.928
I play with Vik sometimes.
He's been teaching me.

11:55.764 --> 11:57.499
Vik taught him.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.737
Yeah, and he taught
me how to make chicken vindaloo.

11:59.738 --> 12:01.073
Chicken what?

12:01.074 --> 12:02.475
It's with cinnamon and paprika

12:02.476 --> 12:04.212
and, like, 500 other spices.

12:04.213 --> 12:05.616
His mother makes it.

12:05.617 --> 12:07.385
He cooks, too?

12:07.386 --> 12:09.657
- Maybe twice.
- Honey.

12:09.658 --> 12:12.730
Whatever you're fighting
about, I'm sure it's fixable.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.166
Can we not?

12:14.167 --> 12:16.705
Your mom's right. Nothing's irreparable.

12:16.706 --> 12:18.307
- Look at us.
- Well, we're not you.

12:19.878 --> 12:21.180
- And I'm not you.
- Talk to him, Helen.

12:21.181 --> 12:22.683
You were so happy the other night.

12:22.684 --> 12:23.885
- Stop it.
- That can't just disappear.

12:23.886 --> 12:25.221
I can't do this. I can't do it.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.725
Whatever he did... whatever you did...

12:26.726 --> 12:29.531
Vik's mad because Mom
let Dad back in the house.

12:36.244 --> 12:38.750
How'd you know that, sweetheart?

12:40.252 --> 12:42.723
I saw him leave last night, out my window.

12:42.724 --> 12:44.761
Wait. Dad was in the house?

12:44.762 --> 12:46.196
- You didn't tell us.
- Our house?

12:46.197 --> 12:47.432
I was going to tell you. I really was...

12:47.433 --> 12:49.136
- This is outrageous!
- Agreed.

12:49.137 --> 12:50.405
Be quiet, I need to talk...
I need to talk to the kids.

12:50.406 --> 12:51.741
She's much worse off than I thought.

12:51.742 --> 12:53.110
Okay, your father was sick.

12:53.111 --> 12:54.614
- His neck was infected.
- So what?

12:54.615 --> 12:56.618
And we just wanted to make
sure that he was better

12:56.619 --> 12:58.087
before you saw him.

12:58.088 --> 13:00.058
Why couldn't we see
him? He was in our house!

13:00.059 --> 13:01.326
Because your father is a criminal.

13:01.327 --> 13:02.596
- Quiet!
- I'm sorry, Helen.

13:02.597 --> 13:04.266
But for you to let him
near these children...

13:04.267 --> 13:05.869
- They're his children!
- He was stabbed.

13:05.870 --> 13:07.506
We don't know what he might be mixed up in.

13:07.507 --> 13:09.109
- What does that mean?
- Nothing, it means nothing.

13:09.110 --> 13:10.679
She's losing her mind.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.115
- Stop it, stop it.
- You have lost your mind.

13:12.116 --> 13:14.019
Both of you are out of control,

13:14.020 --> 13:15.756
and you have no idea what
the fuck you're talking about!

13:15.757 --> 13:17.058
You cannot let him into your house!

13:17.059 --> 13:19.262
- Stop!
- He should be in prison!

13:19.263 --> 13:22.302
Stacey's crying.

13:22.303 --> 13:24.607
Stace, Stace, it's okay. It's okay.

13:24.608 --> 13:26.076
I'm sorry.

13:26.077 --> 13:28.949
- I'm sorry, Mommy.
- Sweetheart.

13:28.950 --> 13:30.953
Shh.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.570
I'm sorry.

13:43.245 --> 13:44.847
No, I am.

13:50.994 --> 13:52.830
You didn't do anything wrong,

13:52.831 --> 13:56.538
and neither did your dad.

13:56.539 --> 13:57.640
What?

14:01.649 --> 14:03.753
It was me.

14:05.823 --> 14:08.427
I hit Scotty Lockhart.

14:08.428 --> 14:09.964
I was driving.

14:09.965 --> 14:11.568
- It was an accident.
- What?

14:11.569 --> 14:12.836
I don't know what I was thinking.

14:12.837 --> 14:14.339
You were driving?

14:14.340 --> 14:16.644
I'm sorry I lied, but I can't keep lying.

14:16.645 --> 14:17.680
- What is this nonsense?
- I'm sorry.

14:17.681 --> 14:19.115
I need you all to know.

14:19.116 --> 14:21.019
And I need the Lockharts to know.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.590
I mean, my God, his poor mother.

14:22.591 --> 14:25.027
I-I'm... I have to tell her.

14:25.028 --> 14:26.864
Bruce! Do something!

14:26.865 --> 14:29.002
- I'm going to tell her.
- The hell you are.

14:29.003 --> 14:30.104
What are you doing?

14:30.105 --> 14:31.541
- Mommy!
- Dad!

14:31.542 --> 14:32.843
- Helen, come here.
- We've got this.

14:32.844 --> 14:34.179
- Get off of me!
- Mommy!

14:34.180 --> 14:35.616
What is happening? What is happening?

14:35.617 --> 14:36.884
- Crazy people!
- We're going this way.

14:36.885 --> 14:38.220
- What...
- Mommy!

14:38.221 --> 14:40.993
You guys are really freaking me out.

14:40.994 --> 14:42.830
What is going on?

14:42.831 --> 14:45.134
- What the fuck is that?
- A panic room.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.470
- What?
- Get in.

14:46.471 --> 14:49.710
My God.

14:49.711 --> 14:51.581
What do you need a panic room for?

14:51.582 --> 14:53.818
For situations like this, for starters.

14:53.819 --> 14:55.522
And in case we get burglarized.

14:55.523 --> 14:58.360
This is, like, where sociopaths
keep women as sex slaves.

14:58.361 --> 15:00.766
You will not take one
step outside this room

15:00.767 --> 15:02.636
until you're calm enough
to talk to Jon Gottlief.

15:02.637 --> 15:03.838
Did you not understand what I said?

15:03.839 --> 15:05.107
I hit Scott Lockhart.

15:05.108 --> 15:06.544
I let Noah go to prison for it.

15:06.545 --> 15:08.147
I let the children believe that he did it.

15:08.148 --> 15:09.215
You're tired, Helen.

15:09.216 --> 15:10.686
The stress of Noah's release

15:10.687 --> 15:12.322
is obviously too much for you to handle.

15:12.323 --> 15:13.792
No, that's not what's happening here.

15:13.793 --> 15:14.827
Look, we're gonna send you somewhere

15:14.828 --> 15:16.330
you can get the rest you need.

15:16.331 --> 15:18.033
- Listen to me.
- You should call Gottlief.

15:18.034 --> 15:19.704
I've already texted him.
He's waiting by the phone.

15:19.705 --> 15:22.375
Please listen to me. I killed someone.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.051
Don't you ever say that again.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.354
Wake up, Helen.

15:28.355 --> 15:29.990
If you talk to Cherry about this,

15:29.991 --> 15:32.529
you leave your entire family
vulnerable to being sued.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.032
Is that what you want?

15:34.033 --> 15:35.869
It would be truly selfish if you confessed.

15:35.870 --> 15:37.338
Selfish?

15:37.339 --> 15:39.510
How much trauma do you
think those kids can take?

15:39.511 --> 15:41.346
They've already seen
their father go to prison.

15:41.347 --> 15:43.450
Do you really want them to
see their mother behind bars?

15:43.451 --> 15:44.920
You don't think they'd send her to prison?

15:44.921 --> 15:46.123
It's a very real possibility.

15:46.124 --> 15:47.593
My God, Bruce, this is bad.

15:47.594 --> 15:49.262
She couldn't make it in prison.

15:49.263 --> 15:50.799
Helen!

15:50.800 --> 15:53.938
Helen!

16:33.251 --> 16:35.287
<i>- Jesus! Fuck!
- It was a deer.</i>

16:35.288 --> 16:36.958
<i>- It's not a deer.
- No, it was a deer.</i>

16:36.959 --> 16:39.563
<i>Pull over!</i>

16:56.464 --> 16:58.769
Helen?

17:00.338 --> 17:02.008
Alison?

17:02.009 --> 17:05.047
- My God.
- What are you doing here?

17:05.048 --> 17:07.084
Well, I-I live here.

17:07.085 --> 17:08.788
What are you doing here?

17:08.789 --> 17:12.563
I was... bringing my kids
to see their grandparents.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.299
- How are the kids?
- They're fine.

17:14.300 --> 17:18.339
God, I miss them. Can
you send them my love?

17:18.340 --> 17:19.476
Okay.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.021
You seen Noah recently?

17:26.022 --> 17:28.327
Yes, I saw him yesterday.

17:28.328 --> 17:30.130
Do they know who did it?

17:30.131 --> 17:31.534
No, they don't.

17:31.535 --> 17:32.803
God, it's so weird.

17:32.804 --> 17:34.105
It's really weird.

17:36.712 --> 17:38.480
How old is Stacey now?

17:38.481 --> 17:41.854
Ten?

17:41.855 --> 17:43.357
- She's 11.
- Wow.

17:43.358 --> 17:45.494
How do you tell an 11-year-old,

17:45.495 --> 17:47.198
"Someone tried to kill your dad"?

17:49.403 --> 17:51.574
I'm sorry. You probably
don't want to hear all this.

17:51.575 --> 17:54.379
You stole my husband.

17:54.380 --> 17:55.815
Okay.

17:55.816 --> 17:58.220
Okay. Right.

17:58.221 --> 18:01.560
Yeah, I think we want
two Jamesons on the rocks.

18:01.561 --> 18:03.798
- Are you even sorry?
- Am I sorry?

18:03.799 --> 18:06.136
Yes and no.

18:07.807 --> 18:10.377
Well, I-I don't think that
I'm solely responsible,

18:10.378 --> 18:13.450
but I don't like knowing
that my actions caused you

18:13.451 --> 18:14.687
or anyone else pain.

18:14.688 --> 18:16.557
I...

18:16.558 --> 18:20.999
Look, I-I wasn't intending to steal Noah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.703
Okay? We... we kind of collided,

18:22.704 --> 18:24.405
and... and one thing led to another,

18:24.406 --> 18:26.042
and then everything fell apart.

18:26.043 --> 18:27.813
And then, you know, if I look back

18:27.814 --> 18:29.415
and try and pick up the pieces,

18:29.416 --> 18:31.419
I can tell you why I think it happened...

18:31.420 --> 18:33.090
You know, who did what to who,

18:33.091 --> 18:37.064
but how much of that
actually matters, you know?

18:39.604 --> 18:42.007
It matters to me...

18:42.008 --> 18:44.078
a lot.

18:45.516 --> 18:47.184
Okay.

18:47.185 --> 18:49.890
Well, if it would help
you to think that it was

18:49.891 --> 18:52.529
all my fault, then fine.

18:52.530 --> 18:55.101
Is anything your fault ever?

18:56.872 --> 18:58.708
Yes.

19:02.650 --> 19:05.688
I'm sorry.

19:05.689 --> 19:06.724
I am sorry.

19:06.725 --> 19:09.596
No, no, it's all right.

19:09.597 --> 19:11.432
Look...

19:11.433 --> 19:15.040
When I lost Gabriel, I-I stopped
believing in cause and effect.

19:15.041 --> 19:18.413
And for a long time after, I...

19:19.784 --> 19:23.524
Truly felt that nothing
I did mattered at all.

19:23.525 --> 19:25.628
And that's when I met Noah.

19:25.629 --> 19:30.538
And the irony is
that he saw my recklessness

19:30.539 --> 19:33.911
as some kind of freedom...

19:33.912 --> 19:36.917
'cause it's what he wanted so desperately.

19:39.489 --> 19:41.492
I wasn't free.

19:41.493 --> 19:46.169
That abandon... that was
just me not giving a shit.

19:53.084 --> 19:56.155
You know, and since Joanie,
I've, um, kind of woken up,

19:56.156 --> 19:58.260
and I care again.

19:58.261 --> 20:01.834
And it's fucking painful sometimes.

20:01.835 --> 20:03.671
<i>You know, something has changed.</i>

20:03.672 --> 20:06.376
I know that nothing, absolutely nothing

20:06.377 --> 20:08.514
lasts forever.

20:08.515 --> 20:10.117
And everyone...

20:10.118 --> 20:13.691
you, me, Noah...

20:13.692 --> 20:17.799
we can only control our own choices...

20:17.800 --> 20:20.370
nobody else's.

20:20.371 --> 20:23.310
We can't save each other.

20:23.311 --> 20:27.652
We can only save ourselves.

20:35.769 --> 20:39.375
I have to tell you something
about the night Scott died.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.851
No, you don't.

20:47.626 --> 20:49.095
I don't?

20:49.096 --> 20:51.800
No. I know.

20:56.811 --> 20:59.215
Did Noah tell you?

20:59.216 --> 21:01.854
No.

21:01.855 --> 21:04.926
I was there.

21:04.927 --> 21:06.496
What?

21:06.497 --> 21:10.404
Yeah, I was on the side of the road, Helen.

21:10.405 --> 21:14.078
Scott and I got into a fight,
and, um, I-I pushed him.

21:14.079 --> 21:15.414
You did what?

21:15.415 --> 21:16.750
Yeah, well, he was attacking me.

21:16.751 --> 21:18.721
My God. My God. My God.

21:18.722 --> 21:20.591
- No, Helen, are you okay?
- My God!

21:20.592 --> 21:22.394
Just... just drink,
drink, drink. It's okay.

21:22.395 --> 21:25.367
My fucking God.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.073
- Noah knows all of this?
- Yeah.

21:29.610 --> 21:31.647
So when he stood up in court and...

21:31.648 --> 21:35.087
I'm such a
fucking colossal idiot.

21:35.088 --> 21:36.757
I'm such a fucking idiot.

21:36.758 --> 21:38.293
No, that's not a very nice
way to talk about yourself.

21:38.294 --> 21:39.596
We have to go to Cherry's house right now.

21:39.597 --> 21:41.332
- No.
- Yes.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.136
Because she has to know, and
I'm not gonna tell her alone.

21:43.137 --> 21:44.673
- No, Helen...
- Yes!

21:44.674 --> 21:47.111
- Alison, we must...
- What good would that do?

21:51.253 --> 21:52.689
You know, look...

21:52.690 --> 21:55.127
Scott was a deeply troubled guy,

21:55.128 --> 21:57.966
and he was trying his best to hurt me.

21:57.967 --> 21:59.836
Yeah, I-I'm sorry for
what happened to him,

21:59.837 --> 22:03.143
but I am not going with
you to his mother's house.

22:03.144 --> 22:06.082
No way.

22:11.661 --> 22:14.900
Take care of yourself, Helen.

22:22.248 --> 22:23.919
Weird night?

22:25.923 --> 22:27.926
Yeah.

23:26.844 --> 23:29.148
Vik.

23:29.149 --> 23:30.651
- Hi.
- Helen.

23:30.652 --> 23:33.156
Great.

23:33.157 --> 23:36.195
Um...

23:36.196 --> 23:37.331
- I...
- What's up?

23:37.332 --> 23:39.034
- I have to get to work.
- Yeah.

23:39.035 --> 23:40.437
Listen, I'm so sorry.

23:40.438 --> 23:42.074
I don't even know where
to begin to tell you

23:42.075 --> 23:43.376
how sorry I am.

23:43.377 --> 23:45.180
You know, the thing is, for my whole life,

23:45.181 --> 23:47.852
I've had this idea of...

23:47.853 --> 23:48.787
who I am,

23:48.788 --> 23:50.357
that I'm a good person,

23:50.358 --> 23:51.593
you know, that I'm generous

23:51.594 --> 23:53.564
and I put other people before myself.

23:53.565 --> 23:56.235
And... and... and...

23:56.236 --> 23:58.373
it's just... it's not true.

23:58.374 --> 24:00.043
I mean, none of that is true.

24:00.044 --> 24:02.582
No, it's not. Good-bye.

24:02.583 --> 24:04.586
I killed Scott Lockhart.

24:11.601 --> 24:13.904
It wasn't Noah.

24:13.905 --> 24:17.745
I was driving...

24:17.746 --> 24:21.085
because he was drunk.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.722
Jesus.

24:22.723 --> 24:24.258
Helen...

24:24.259 --> 24:25.728
So, anyway, you were right.

24:25.729 --> 24:29.201
I was lying to everybody...

24:29.202 --> 24:32.374
to my kids and myself and...

24:32.375 --> 24:35.480
you.

24:35.481 --> 24:37.250
Why?

24:37.251 --> 24:38.486
Um...

24:41.092 --> 24:44.465
Because I was afraid to go to prison.

24:46.571 --> 24:49.576
Because I thought that somehow it was fair

24:49.577 --> 24:51.445
because Noah had totally fucked up my life,

24:51.446 --> 24:54.953
and so I-I thought maybe
this would make it even.

24:54.954 --> 24:57.324
I mean, just let him go.

24:57.325 --> 24:59.161
You know, let him suffer.

24:59.162 --> 25:02.602
And the kids needed me,
and he'd lost them already,

25:02.603 --> 25:06.041
and mostly, really, it's
because I'm a coward.

25:08.213 --> 25:09.816
Most people are.

25:09.817 --> 25:11.753
No, you're not.

25:11.754 --> 25:13.289
Yeah.

25:13.290 --> 25:15.293
But I'm an asshole.

25:22.809 --> 25:24.612
Anyway, I thought it made sense.

25:24.613 --> 25:26.516
I tried to make it make sense,

25:26.517 --> 25:29.956
I know it was an awful, awful...

25:29.957 --> 25:32.995
thing to do, which I realized, of course,

25:32.996 --> 25:36.268
on some level, but, um...

25:36.269 --> 25:39.676
that is why I let Noah back in,

25:39.677 --> 25:41.613
because I felt like I owed him,

25:41.614 --> 25:43.684
and I was trying to fix what I did.

25:43.685 --> 25:46.188
It was not because I loved him.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.330
And I don't expect you to forgive me.

25:50.331 --> 25:53.336
I just really needed to tell you.

25:58.881 --> 26:02.153
Okay.

26:02.154 --> 26:03.456
Thank you...

26:03.457 --> 26:05.193
I guess.

26:08.601 --> 26:10.804
Is there anything else?

26:10.805 --> 26:12.708
I have to take out someone's gallbladder

26:12.709 --> 26:13.677
in 32 minutes.

26:13.678 --> 26:15.514
I'm sorry. No, just go.

26:20.525 --> 26:23.462
Um, I just... I don't know what to do.

26:26.704 --> 26:29.709
I don't know how to live with this.

26:34.218 --> 26:35.921
You just do.

26:46.911 --> 26:50.249
I'll find you after work.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.253
Okay?

26:58.534 --> 27:00.738
Okay.

27:24.991 --> 27:29.961
_

28:03.296 --> 28:06.970
Are you kidding me?

28:06.971 --> 28:09.241
He said that to you?

28:09.242 --> 28:12.046
What an asshole.

28:12.047 --> 28:14.484
Girl, you got
to get up out of there.

28:14.485 --> 28:17.791
- Just go.
- Excuse me, are you Kaylee?

28:17.792 --> 28:21.799
I would've been up out of there. Are you...

28:21.800 --> 28:22.801
Yeah, I know. I know, but...

28:22.802 --> 28:25.106
A-are you Kaylee?

28:25.107 --> 28:26.174
Yes, I am.

28:26.175 --> 28:28.412
Can I help you, sweetheart?

28:28.413 --> 28:31.184
Yeah? And what'd he say to that?

28:31.185 --> 28:32.588
Can I get a haircut?

28:34.292 --> 28:37.330
Well, I would love to,
but my shift just ended.

28:37.331 --> 28:38.700
Amy can help you, though.

28:38.701 --> 28:41.272
I'd like you to do it.

28:43.209 --> 28:45.681
Well, I'm flattered, but I got to get home

28:45.682 --> 28:46.783
and get dinner started.

28:46.784 --> 28:47.818
Amy's great, though.

28:47.819 --> 28:49.523
You're in good hands.

28:52.394 --> 28:54.632
Okay.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.639
Take care, sweetheart.

28:58.874 --> 29:01.144
You certainly need a haircut.

29:01.145 --> 29:03.449
Come on, sit down.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.752
Where are you going?

30:18.233 --> 30:20.805
Hey.

30:23.143 --> 30:25.614
Hi.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.619
Hello.

30:33.764 --> 30:36.168
I'm looking for John Gunther.

30:36.169 --> 30:39.508
Hello.

30:39.509 --> 30:41.344
Is that your dad?

30:41.345 --> 30:43.282
Is... is John Gunther your dad?

30:43.283 --> 30:47.223
H-hello.

30:47.224 --> 30:48.626
Is...

30:48.627 --> 30:51.464
Is J... is he home? Can you go get him?

30:51.465 --> 30:52.668
- Ollie?
- Hello. Hello.

30:52.669 --> 30:54.070
Ollie, honey.

30:54.071 --> 30:55.574
Who is it? My God! What do you want?

30:55.575 --> 30:57.076
Get away!

30:57.077 --> 30:58.713
I don't want to hurt you. I just want...

30:58.714 --> 31:00.249
- Get away from us!
- Hello? What's going on?

31:00.250 --> 31:02.153
- Leave us alone!
- I just want to see John...

31:02.154 --> 31:03.322
- Hey, what's going on?
- I just want to see John!

31:03.323 --> 31:04.858
What the hell? Solloway?

31:04.859 --> 31:06.361
John! Jonathan, this guy followed me home!

31:06.362 --> 31:07.798
- Shh, all right, come on.
- John...

31:07.799 --> 31:09.602
Hey, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

31:09.603 --> 31:10.971
Just hang on.

31:10.972 --> 31:12.440
All right.

31:12.441 --> 31:14.645
Ohhhh.

31:14.646 --> 31:15.981
Put it on... headphones.

31:15.982 --> 31:17.149
Shh.

31:17.150 --> 31:18.218
Shh.

31:18.219 --> 31:19.487
Come here. Hug Daddy.

31:19.488 --> 31:20.890
- There we go.
- John...

31:22.862 --> 31:24.197
I know.

31:24.198 --> 31:25.834
Who is that man?

31:27.304 --> 31:29.808
All right, it's time for jammies.

31:29.809 --> 31:32.246
- Do you know what happened?
- Jammies.

31:32.247 --> 31:33.516
All right?

31:43.336 --> 31:46.041
Come here, honey.

31:46.042 --> 31:48.278
Come on. It's all right.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.752
Come on, honey.

31:51.753 --> 31:53.790
Come on.

31:53.791 --> 31:56.295
Come on.

31:58.232 --> 32:00.236
Solloway.

32:01.907 --> 32:04.511
So...

32:04.512 --> 32:07.518
can I help you?

32:09.589 --> 32:12.260
What do you want from me, man?

32:13.997 --> 32:16.603
Are you trying to kill me?

32:18.674 --> 32:20.342
No.

32:20.343 --> 32:22.113
I-I don't know what you're talking about.

32:22.114 --> 32:25.352
Why have you been following me?

32:25.353 --> 32:27.390
- I'm not following you.
- You came to my house.

32:27.391 --> 32:30.295
- When?
- Last fucking night.

32:30.296 --> 32:33.536
I swear, I was right here last
night with my wife and my kid.

32:33.537 --> 32:35.272
You've been stalking me since Fishkill.

32:35.273 --> 32:37.209
You tried to hit me with your fucking car.

32:37.210 --> 32:39.313
Okay.

32:39.314 --> 32:43.990
Listen, you're confused.

32:43.991 --> 32:46.629
I haven't seen you since Fishkill.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.900
You're lying to me.

32:48.901 --> 32:50.570
Let's take a walk, all right?

32:50.571 --> 32:52.339
There's a place around the
corner where we can get a beer

32:52.340 --> 32:53.810
and talk about this, all right?

32:53.811 --> 32:55.145
Parole officer doesn't have to know

32:55.146 --> 32:56.649
anything about it, just you and me...

32:56.650 --> 32:57.984
- I don't care about that.
- Whoa, hey!

32:57.985 --> 32:59.353
- Hey, cool it.
- You remember that?

32:59.354 --> 33:00.523
- You remember it now?
- All right.

33:00.524 --> 33:02.326
- Look familiar?
- Cool it.

33:02.327 --> 33:04.363
From your family's store.
I got it from your mother.

33:04.364 --> 33:05.733
My mother?

33:05.734 --> 33:08.104
You need to leave me the fuck alone.

33:08.105 --> 33:10.209
Just leave me alone!

33:10.210 --> 33:11.979
You've been trying to kill me!

33:11.980 --> 33:13.950
I don't want to kill you.

33:13.951 --> 33:16.287
- You hate me!
- I don't even know you.

33:16.288 --> 33:18.826
You're jealous of me 'cause I got out.

33:18.827 --> 33:20.630
You got out of what? You got out of prison?

33:20.631 --> 33:22.132
No, out of Bloomsburg.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.170
- All right.
- Fucking backwoods shithole.

33:24.171 --> 33:25.339
I got out.

33:25.340 --> 33:26.775
And you got stuck there.

33:30.183 --> 33:31.952
- I don't want to hurt you, man.
- Yes, you do!

33:31.953 --> 33:33.355
- You...
- No, I don't.

33:33.356 --> 33:35.292
You tried to fucking kill me last night!

33:35.293 --> 33:37.864
Cool it.

33:37.865 --> 33:39.333
This is what you're gonna do.

33:39.334 --> 33:40.469
Listen to me carefully.

33:40.470 --> 33:41.872
You're gonna walk away.

33:41.873 --> 33:44.443
You're gonna leave me and my wife

33:44.444 --> 33:45.980
and my kid alone,

33:45.981 --> 33:48.184
and you're never gonna come back.

33:48.185 --> 33:50.557
And listen very carefully.

33:50.558 --> 33:53.729
You're gonna get some help.

33:53.730 --> 33:55.733
I'm gonna let go of you now.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.405
And you're gonna walk away.

34:12.635 --> 34:15.304
Gotta go.

34:15.306 --> 34:18.512
I cut you. Where...

34:18.513 --> 34:20.783
Show me your other hand.

34:20.784 --> 34:22.887
The other one.

34:52.246 --> 34:54.016
<i>Noah!</i>

34:54.016 --> 34:55.351
<i>Noah!</i>

34:58.860 --> 35:00.062
<i>Noah!</i>

35:06.175 --> 35:08.211
<i>Noah!</i>

35:31.960 --> 35:33.729
Hello, Mr. Solloway.

35:33.730 --> 35:35.465
How are you this fine afternoon?

35:44.919 --> 35:46.955
I-I just can't put it down.

35:46.956 --> 35:50.128
I brought it here 'cause...

35:50.129 --> 35:53.169
I want to read you one
of my favorite passages.

35:58.747 --> 36:00.750
Water.

36:00.751 --> 36:02.419
Sorry, what was that?

36:02.420 --> 36:06.194
I need... I need... I need some water.

36:06.195 --> 36:09.099
I haven't drunk anything for two days.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.705
If that is true, you'd be dead.

36:11.706 --> 36:14.376
Where is it? Yeah.

36:14.377 --> 36:16.448
I drank my piss.

36:18.485 --> 36:20.656
Noah, come on, I brought you your breakfast

36:20.657 --> 36:22.226
this morning myself.

36:22.227 --> 36:24.396
Where is it?

36:24.397 --> 36:26.234
There. Wait, hang on.

36:26.235 --> 36:28.939
Here we go.

36:35.787 --> 36:38.792
"He knew he had to write
back or at least call"

36:38.793 --> 36:41.698
and tell them they
could give away his spot.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.535
Somehow, he couldn't take the envelope

36:43.536 --> 36:46.942
from his back pocket
and stick it in the mail.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.013
The word 'death'

36:49.014 --> 36:52.185
hung over his consciousness for days.

36:52.186 --> 36:54.356
Every time he closed his eyes,

36:54.357 --> 36:57.296
he could see the way
his own life would end.

36:57.297 --> 36:59.801
He would give up the scholarship.

36:59.802 --> 37:03.676
Get a job somewhere in town.

37:03.677 --> 37:06.648
But doing what?

37:06.649 --> 37:10.355
They were already laying
people off at the coal mine.

37:10.356 --> 37:12.860
So what else was there?

37:12.861 --> 37:14.798
A trucker,

37:14.799 --> 37:17.036
like his father?

37:21.011 --> 37:23.181
There was always the prison one town over.

37:23.182 --> 37:25.720
"Some of his school buddies had
already applied to be guards."

37:27.323 --> 37:29.995
"But the idea of being
around those degenerates,"

37:29.996 --> 37:33.301
day in and day out, when he
himself had so much potential,

37:33.302 --> 37:36.742
- and he knew it, he just...
- "he knew it."

37:39.147 --> 37:42.520
"And here, in his back pocket,"

37:42.521 --> 37:45.726
was his literal ticket out,

37:45.727 --> 37:49.433
but he may as well use
it to wipe his own ass,

37:49.434 --> 37:52.840
for all the good it would do him.

37:52.841 --> 37:56.214
Then there was his mother...

37:58.452 --> 38:00.956
Sunken in her hospital bed.

38:00.957 --> 38:03.996
Half in the other world already.

38:03.997 --> 38:07.302
At night, he would wake up from
dreams that she had overdosed

38:07.303 --> 38:10.408
on her pain medication,

38:10.409 --> 38:12.880
died in her sleep

38:12.881 --> 38:14.684
"and set him free."

38:14.685 --> 38:16.387
What?

38:16.388 --> 38:20.195
No.

38:20.196 --> 38:22.165
I never wrote that.

38:22.166 --> 38:26.173
Yeah, you did. It's right here...

38:26.174 --> 38:28.612
on the page, clear as day.

38:30.349 --> 38:34.858
"Soon the thought was
plaguing him constantly,"

38:34.859 --> 38:36.695
even when he was awake.

38:36.696 --> 38:39.133
What if he accidentally
tripped on her ventilator cord

38:39.134 --> 38:41.070
and it came out of the wall?

38:41.071 --> 38:44.309
No, no, no no, he was
more clever than that.

38:44.310 --> 38:46.882
He'd gotten a full ride
to college, hadn't he?

38:46.883 --> 38:51.725
He had the kind of charm that
people called irresistible.

38:51.726 --> 38:54.129
He could convince almost anyone

38:54.130 --> 38:56.768
to do almost anything.

38:56.769 --> 39:01.243
So he set about finding a
way to convince his mother

39:01.244 --> 39:04.082
"that she wanted to die."

39:04.083 --> 39:06.922
What are you reading?

39:06.923 --> 39:08.191
Your novel.

39:08.192 --> 39:10.129
I didn't write that.

39:16.308 --> 39:17.643
I didn't write that.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.483
"He left a program about assisted suicide"

39:21.484 --> 39:22.987
on the television.

39:22.988 --> 39:24.591
He started reading her poetry

39:24.592 --> 39:27.495
about angels and musing
about the afterlife.

39:27.496 --> 39:31.738
And then... he even replaced
some of her pain medication

39:31.739 --> 39:35.613
"with sugar pills so she would
think the end was very near..."

39:35.614 --> 39:37.984
Stop. Stop, stop!

39:41.959 --> 39:44.631
What did you do?

39:44.632 --> 39:45.833
What did I do?

39:45.834 --> 39:47.503
That isn't what I wrote.

39:47.504 --> 39:50.208
You've added to my manuscript.

39:50.209 --> 39:52.212
Me?

39:52.213 --> 39:54.016
I'm flattered, bud.

39:54.017 --> 39:57.355
But, um, I didn't even
graduate high school.

39:58.559 --> 40:00.061
Can't even spell.

40:00.062 --> 40:01.631
- Give that to me.
- Hey!

40:01.632 --> 40:03.735
Back off!

40:07.711 --> 40:09.981
This is my favorite part.

40:16.428 --> 40:18.064
"Jack breathed a sigh of relief

40:18.065 --> 40:21.337
as he watched his mother
swallow the medicine."

40:23.876 --> 40:25.779
- That isn't what happened!
- Hey!

40:30.790 --> 40:33.427
Pick it up.

40:35.132 --> 40:37.036
Speak English?

40:43.883 --> 40:45.719
And obviously, he wanted her dead.

40:45.720 --> 40:47.122
- No, he didn't.
- Yeah, he did.

40:47.123 --> 40:48.658
He had a scholarship. He wanted to get out.

40:48.659 --> 40:51.263
Yeah, but he didn't want that.

40:54.838 --> 40:58.645
Then why is it in the
novel that he took the pills

40:58.646 --> 41:01.083
and he ground 'em up
and then he put 'em in...

41:01.084 --> 41:04.690
She asked him to!

41:04.691 --> 41:06.694
She was in pain.

41:06.695 --> 41:09.767
She was suffering. He didn't want to do it.

41:09.768 --> 41:12.439
It ended his childhood.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.443
It ruined his life.

41:16.949 --> 41:19.654
It's confusing, isn't it?

41:19.655 --> 41:23.829
I mean, we both agree about what happened,

41:23.830 --> 41:27.435
but we disagree about
the meaning of the act.

41:27.436 --> 41:32.145
Now, if we go with your
interpretation of the truth...

41:32.146 --> 41:34.082
it's mercy.

41:34.083 --> 41:37.455
If we go with my belief, it's murder.

41:37.456 --> 41:39.359
It's not open to interpretation.

41:39.360 --> 41:41.531
Memory can be very faulty, Noah.

41:41.532 --> 41:43.167
We all know that.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.506
I was there, and you weren't.

41:45.507 --> 41:47.510
Wasn't I?

41:52.521 --> 41:55.893
I don't know where that stuff came from.

41:55.894 --> 41:57.362
I didn't write it.

41:57.363 --> 41:58.464
Then who did?

41:58.465 --> 42:00.401
You must have.

42:02.172 --> 42:03.775
What happened, Noah?

42:03.776 --> 42:04.977
You know that.

42:04.978 --> 42:06.113
- What happened?
- You know that.

42:06.114 --> 42:07.516
Tell me again. I forget.

42:07.517 --> 42:09.419
- What'd you do?
- I killed a man.

42:09.420 --> 42:11.123
No, you didn't. You
weren't driving the car.

42:11.124 --> 42:13.695
What really happened?

42:13.696 --> 42:16.099
I took the fall for my wife.

42:20.275 --> 42:22.278
Why'd you do that?

42:25.820 --> 42:28.525
'Cause I had an affair.

42:28.526 --> 42:31.898
Why'd you have an affair?

42:31.899 --> 42:34.971
I don't know.

42:34.972 --> 42:36.908
Yes, you do.

42:36.909 --> 42:38.545
What happened?

42:41.250 --> 42:42.920
What did you do?

42:53.609 --> 42:55.444
What did you do?

43:02.393 --> 43:04.396
What did you do?

43:07.169 --> 43:10.341
I met a girl. I thought I could save her.

43:12.479 --> 43:15.184
And so you needed to save her

43:15.185 --> 43:19.325
because you murdered your mother.

43:19.326 --> 43:21.531
And that's why you're here.

43:21.532 --> 43:23.568
And that's what you did.

43:25.606 --> 43:27.743
Aah!

43:38.131 --> 43:39.700
Where did you go?

43:49.888 --> 43:52.058
Where did you go?

43:55.265 --> 43:56.834
Where did you go?

43:56.835 --> 43:58.571
Where did you go?

44:06.622 --> 44:08.691
Where did you go?

47:42.185 --> 47:43.754
<i>Noah!</i>

47:45.993 --> 47:48.430
<i>Noah!</i>
