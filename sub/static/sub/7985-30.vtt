00:01.050 --> 00:03.561
<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...
I'm finished!

00:03.561 --> 00:04.596
NEWSWOMAN:
Abby Lee Miller,

00:04.596 --> 00:06.399
in serious legal drama,

00:06.399 --> 00:09.038
faces up to five years in jail.

00:09.038 --> 00:10.173
ABBY LEE:
<i>These are the first solos</i>

00:10.173 --> 00:11.175
<i>of the season.</i>

00:11.175 --> 00:12.211
In seventh place,

00:12.211 --> 00:14.917
number 25, "Cold and Clear."

00:16.252 --> 00:18.189
KENDALL: <i>I can just tell JoJo</i>
<i>doesn't really like this dance.</i>

00:18.189 --> 00:19.593
JESSALYNN:
<i>JoJo's not doing this.</i>

00:19.593 --> 00:22.331
Girls, where is
the class clown?
ASHLEE:
She's not here.

00:22.331 --> 00:23.433
She doesn't want
to be a dancer.

00:23.433 --> 00:24.770
She wants to be
a Kardashian.

00:24.770 --> 00:27.374
In third place, "Invincible."

00:27.374 --> 00:29.178
ABBY LEE: <i>This was</i>
<i>your big comeback week,</i>

00:29.178 --> 00:30.582
<i>and I still saw five solos.</i>

00:30.582 --> 00:31.850
First place

00:31.850 --> 00:34.021
in our teen advanced group,
"Hotline."

00:34.021 --> 00:36.392
(applause and cheers)

00:36.392 --> 00:38.864
Jess, you picked
a really bad week to bail

00:38.864 --> 00:40.602
<i>because this is gonna</i>
<i>go down in history</i>

00:40.602 --> 00:42.137
<i>as one of the ALDC's</i>
<i>best dances,</i>

00:42.137 --> 00:44.743
<i>and you're not gonna</i>
<i>be a part of it.</i>

00:44.743 --> 00:46.145
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:46.145 --> 00:47.214
SARI:
<i>I still feel like the minis</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:48.517
<i>are struggling</i>
<i>to work together.</i>

00:48.517 --> 00:50.755
<i>She might decide</i>
<i>she doesn't want us here.</i>

00:50.755 --> 00:53.159
ABBY LEE: Brynn, this is your
first solo in a long time.

00:53.159 --> 00:54.328
It has to be amazing.

00:54.328 --> 00:55.330
ASHLEE:
<i>She has got to prove</i>

00:55.330 --> 00:56.332
<i>to herself</i>

00:56.332 --> 00:57.769
<i>and Abby and the team</i>

00:57.769 --> 01:00.808
that she is the winning soloist
on this team.

01:00.808 --> 01:03.480
HOLLY: <i>Our group dance</i>
<i>is an absolute nightmare</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:04.650
<i>and a joke.</i>

01:04.650 --> 01:06.052
ABBY LEE:
Try to save it!

01:06.052 --> 01:07.154
JILL:
<i>Abby's not even trying to help</i>

01:07.154 --> 01:09.593
<i>them out and she's given up.</i>

01:09.593 --> 01:11.897
Remember, if anything happens,
don't show it on your face.

01:11.897 --> 01:14.368
HOLLY: <i>They don't have</i>
<i>a backup plan, do they?</i>

01:14.368 --> 01:15.638
No.

01:17.341 --> 01:20.414
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:20.414 --> 01:22.017
♪ ♪

01:28.396 --> 01:31.102
HOLLY:
<i>It's so cold in here.</i>

01:31.102 --> 01:33.306
So, I guess we're here?

01:33.306 --> 01:35.310
Elly, make sure
you're stretching.

01:35.310 --> 01:36.580
ASHLEE:
So, you guys
haven't heard

01:36.580 --> 01:37.849
whether Jess is
coming back or not?

01:37.849 --> 01:39.318
Nothing?
I called her

01:39.318 --> 01:40.955
twice over the weekend
and didn't...

01:40.955 --> 01:42.191
like, we didn't hook up.

01:42.191 --> 01:44.261
HOLLY:
I do not think
she's coming back.

01:46.065 --> 01:47.267
Did you guys see that article

01:47.267 --> 01:48.671
about Abby?
Yes.

01:48.671 --> 01:50.808
HOLLY:
She filed
an extension.

01:50.808 --> 01:51.810
Another extension.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.113
I don't know if
that's six or seven.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.315
The one I read said,

01:54.315 --> 01:57.087
"While things are far
from a solid agreement,

01:57.087 --> 01:59.826
"the terms of the discussion
right now are inclined

01:59.826 --> 02:02.030
"towards paying a big fine
and getting probation,

02:02.030 --> 02:03.133
but escaping jail time."

02:03.133 --> 02:05.505
This is far from solid,

02:05.505 --> 02:06.507
so it's still
up in the air.

02:06.507 --> 02:08.944
Right.
At this point,

02:08.944 --> 02:10.882
all we have to do
is worry about our kids

02:10.882 --> 02:12.417
and what their
future holds here

02:12.417 --> 02:13.721
at Abby's.

02:13.721 --> 02:15.056
<i>Things have been really hard</i>

02:15.056 --> 02:16.593
<i>for our team lately.</i>

02:16.593 --> 02:18.964
<i>Last week,</i>
<i>JoJo officially quit the team</i>

02:18.964 --> 02:22.204
<i>and now, Abby's</i>
<i>in the news yet again,</i>

02:22.204 --> 02:25.343
filing for another extension
in her court case.

02:25.343 --> 02:27.080
<i>We have a lot of questions.</i>

02:27.080 --> 02:28.684
JILL:
Oh, hey.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.792
(sighs)

02:32.792 --> 02:34.996
You just got here.

02:34.996 --> 02:36.432
Say, "Hey, welcome.
How was your weekend?"

02:38.236 --> 02:39.238
ABBY LEE:
You son of a bitch.

02:39.238 --> 02:40.240
Get the hell
out of here.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.142
Lock the door.

02:41.142 --> 02:43.479
Lock the door. Lock the door.

02:43.479 --> 02:44.516
What in God's good Earth
happened?

02:44.516 --> 02:45.585
HOLLY:
Aw, she's losing

02:45.585 --> 02:47.589
her mind.
I hear her.

02:47.589 --> 02:49.358
She's on the phone.
I can see her silhouette.

02:49.358 --> 02:51.597
She's fussing again.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.803
These mothers have no clue.

02:54.803 --> 02:57.809
I was not put on this earth

02:57.809 --> 02:59.478
<i>to be at their beck and call.</i>

02:59.478 --> 03:01.082
<i>Normally, I would be doing</i>

03:01.082 --> 03:03.921
<i>the pyramid</i>
<i>and then rehearsing,</i>

03:03.921 --> 03:05.958
but I have problems of my own
to deal with.

03:05.958 --> 03:08.564
And sometimes
they have to take priority.

03:08.564 --> 03:09.866
And you know what?
I don't want to know

03:09.866 --> 03:12.839
her personal business
as far as w‐what she's doing

03:12.839 --> 03:15.277
and all the negotiations
and the plea bar...

03:15.277 --> 03:17.314
I just want to know
what that means for us.

03:17.314 --> 03:18.483
Are you gonna be here
to lead a team?

03:18.483 --> 03:20.120
Or are you not gonna
be here to lead a team?

03:20.120 --> 03:21.355
Are you gonna
be here sometimes?

03:21.355 --> 03:22.692
Do you have a backup plan?

03:22.692 --> 03:23.994
HOLLY:
Yeah. What is
your plan?

03:25.263 --> 03:27.467
ASHLEE:
Hey, Gia.
GIANNA: What?

03:27.467 --> 03:29.305
Are we able to get
started on something?
Yeah.

03:29.305 --> 03:31.475
Okay, well,
I'm gonna start

03:31.475 --> 03:33.012
with the groups first,

03:33.012 --> 03:35.016
considering the circumstances
and constraint

03:35.016 --> 03:37.154
that we only have
today and tomorrow

03:37.154 --> 03:38.624
because we need
the travel day

03:38.624 --> 03:39.592
to get to the
competition.

03:39.592 --> 03:41.563
With the minis,
for their group,

03:41.563 --> 03:42.765
it's a jazz group

03:42.765 --> 03:44.335
and it's called "Gossip Girls."

03:44.335 --> 03:46.439
JILL:
Oh, that's cute.
GIANNA:
And it's sassy.

03:46.439 --> 03:47.875
It's really cute.
And then you guys are

03:47.875 --> 03:50.046
completely different,
and it is contemporary

03:50.046 --> 03:52.084
and it's called... I believe
it's called "The Picnic."

03:52.084 --> 03:54.054
And so you guys
are sitting

03:54.054 --> 03:56.125
on this, basically,
a picnic blanket.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.597
A red and white, um,
checkered blanket

03:58.597 --> 04:00.200
that starts out
normal size

04:00.200 --> 04:01.202
and then gradually
gets bigger.

04:01.202 --> 04:02.204
By the end of
the routine,

04:02.204 --> 04:04.743
it takes up the entire stage.

04:04.743 --> 04:05.845
So...

04:05.845 --> 04:07.715
I just don't know
about mini solos.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.151
I know that

04:09.151 --> 04:11.489
Brynn's doing
a kind of character,

04:11.489 --> 04:13.159
contemporary piece, and it's
called "Left at the Altar."

04:13.159 --> 04:14.328
(Holly whoops)

04:14.328 --> 04:16.700
<i>I'm really excited</i>
<i>to have my first</i>

04:16.700 --> 04:18.537
solo of the season because

04:18.537 --> 04:21.308
<i>when Kalani, Kendall,</i>
<i>and JoJo had solos,</i>

04:21.308 --> 04:23.279
<i>they didn't place that well.</i>

04:23.279 --> 04:25.016
<i>So, this is my chance</i>

04:25.016 --> 04:27.622
to prove that I can be
Abby's number one soloist.

04:27.622 --> 04:30.360
KIRA:
Gia, I feel like you have
a lot on your plate.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.763
Maybe you should
take the girls, and...

04:31.763 --> 04:32.799
Yeah, please.

04:32.799 --> 04:35.336
I'm gonna start
with you guys today.

04:35.336 --> 04:36.673
Okay, the elites! Yay.

04:38.376 --> 04:40.447
GIANNA: <i>So, Brynn,</i>
<i>you're under it right now.</i>

04:42.552 --> 04:43.821
And then whenever

04:43.821 --> 04:46.092
<i>Brynn comes up,</i>
<i>you need a big thing.</i>

04:46.092 --> 04:48.630
Six, seven, eight...

04:48.630 --> 04:50.835
(girls laughing)

04:50.835 --> 04:52.572
This week is our first week

04:52.572 --> 04:55.310
<i>without JoJo,</i>
<i>and we kind of needed</i>

04:55.310 --> 04:57.314
more bodies
for this prop because

04:57.314 --> 05:00.220
<i>our prop is literally</i>
<i>eating us alive.</i>

05:00.220 --> 05:02.658
I mean, we haven't done
it right once,

05:02.658 --> 05:05.363
<i>and Abby's not here,</i>
<i>which makes it even harder.</i>

05:05.363 --> 05:06.465
HOLLY:
<i>I don't know.</i>

05:06.465 --> 05:08.202
I don't see
the vision yet, so...

05:08.202 --> 05:09.939
ASHLEE:
<i>We won't have our pyramid</i>
<i>to know</i>

05:09.939 --> 05:11.375
<i>why she picked</i>
<i>the picnic theme.</i>

05:11.375 --> 05:12.578
<i>She may have told us</i>

05:12.578 --> 05:14.381
if we had our pyramid.
HOLLY:
At least we have

05:14.381 --> 05:16.218
<i>someone in there teaching,</i>
<i>um, a dance.</i>

05:16.218 --> 05:17.287
GIANNA:
<i>It's like a tea party.</i>

05:17.287 --> 05:18.891
<i>It's, like, quirky.</i>

05:18.891 --> 05:21.796
Like, first, fifth, jump on it,
jump off of it.

05:21.796 --> 05:24.636
JILL:
<i>This will challenge the kids.</i>

05:24.636 --> 05:26.305
<i>It will help them grow.</i>

05:26.305 --> 05:29.612
But it might not be
competition‐worthy.

05:29.612 --> 05:30.948
Yeah.

05:30.948 --> 05:32.818
<i>Last week, the girls</i>
<i>had a phenomenal number,</i>

05:32.818 --> 05:34.421
<i>"Suicide Hotline."</i>

05:34.421 --> 05:37.294
<i>It was really powerful.</i>

05:37.294 --> 05:38.797
<i>And this week,</i>

05:38.797 --> 05:42.237
<i>they're doing a dance with this</i>
<i>humongous prop about a picnic.</i>

05:42.237 --> 05:47.247
And... it's not very good.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.617
Done with the group for today.

05:48.617 --> 05:49.986
And then we have the
minis with their group

05:49.986 --> 05:50.988
right now, so I can do
a little bit with them.

05:50.988 --> 05:53.961
So... that's all
I know right now.

05:53.961 --> 05:55.196
STACEY:
Hey, you guys.

05:55.196 --> 05:57.367
So, you haven't seen Abby today,
right?

05:57.367 --> 05:58.704
GIRLS: No.
Not really?

06:01.543 --> 06:03.479
So, how'd you go in there?

06:06.118 --> 06:08.356
STACEY: Well, I don't
think Lilli has a solo,

06:08.356 --> 06:09.759
'cause she hasn't
even started it.

06:09.759 --> 06:11.028
She does. She has... um,

06:11.028 --> 06:12.430
indeed tried on the costume.

06:12.430 --> 06:13.734
She might have a costume,

06:13.734 --> 06:15.036
but she doesn't have a dance.

06:15.036 --> 06:16.338
<i>The girls have had</i>

06:16.338 --> 06:18.109
<i>a really hard time</i>
<i>over the last few weeks.</i>

06:18.109 --> 06:19.278
<i>Now I'm hearing</i>
<i>that my daughter</i>

06:19.278 --> 06:20.547
<i>tried on a solo costume</i>

06:20.547 --> 06:21.983
<i>and I'm getting</i>
<i>a little hopeful.</i>

06:21.983 --> 06:22.985
<i>I feel like it's fair</i>

06:22.985 --> 06:24.354
for her to get a solo,

06:24.354 --> 06:26.225
<i>but I feel like</i>
<i>it's not gonna happen.</i>

06:26.225 --> 06:28.462
GIANNA:
<i>So, guys.</i>
<i>So, your dance this week</i>

06:28.462 --> 06:30.300
is called "Gossip Girls."

06:30.300 --> 06:32.037
Now, I don't know what
happened with your moms

06:32.037 --> 06:33.940
<i>or Abby or whatever gossip</i>
<i>they were all talking about,</i>

06:33.940 --> 06:35.109
<i>but apparently,</i>
<i>there's a ton of it</i>

06:35.109 --> 06:36.546
going on in this dance studio
right now.

06:36.546 --> 06:37.882
So, don't let this routine

06:37.882 --> 06:39.318
get all mushed

06:39.318 --> 06:41.923
and all sloppy
because of all that gossip

06:41.923 --> 06:43.392
<i>and all that chaos out there.</i>

06:43.392 --> 06:46.833
You guys need to be sassy and
cute gossip girls in here. Okay?

06:46.833 --> 06:48.770
<i>Here we go.</i>

06:48.770 --> 06:50.306
<i>Go. Good.</i>

06:50.306 --> 06:52.611
Go through.

06:52.611 --> 06:54.549
It's like, because it's like,
"Did you tell it?"

06:54.549 --> 06:56.820
Like, "We‐‐ what‐‐ was it you?"

06:56.820 --> 06:58.623
And then, and then push
her away. Go, guys.

06:58.623 --> 06:59.625
Push her away.

06:59.625 --> 07:02.598
Dah, dah, dah. Through.

07:02.598 --> 07:04.969
YOLANDA:
<i>There is gossip here.</i>

07:04.969 --> 07:06.873
<i>The other mini moms</i>
<i>create fights</i>

07:06.873 --> 07:09.411
between us, as well
as the junior elite moms, too.

07:09.411 --> 07:12.217
A three‐year‐old can jazz walk
just as well as she can.

07:13.252 --> 07:15.591
Kira is trash.

07:15.591 --> 07:17.427
That's what she is!
She's entitled trash.

07:17.427 --> 07:20.433
YOLANDA:
<i>I really think it's important</i>
<i>for the mini moms just</i>

07:20.433 --> 07:23.874
<i>to focus on the girls, since</i>
<i>last week, Abby still said</i>

07:23.874 --> 07:25.811
<i>they're not dancing</i>
<i>like a team.</i>

07:25.811 --> 07:28.449
Even though Abby said
they are official members,

07:28.449 --> 07:30.253
they still don't even
have their jackets.

07:30.253 --> 07:31.689
<i>This routine is</i>

07:31.689 --> 07:34.896

07:42.611 --> 07:44.281
that all of us have
issues on the team.

07:44.281 --> 07:46.485
That's why she named the routine
"Gossip Girl."

have a teacher.

07:51.261 --> 07:53.432

there was gonna be

07:53.432 --> 07:55.002
solos from both teams.

I don't think that
that's gonna happen by Saturday.

Why don't you go back
there and ask her?

07:58.175 --> 08:00.112
I'm serious and I wouldn't
say that if I didn't.

08:00.112 --> 08:01.883

ASHLEE: Yeah.

08:05.624 --> 08:07.528
"Abby, can I have
a moment with you?"
Yeah.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.830
Okay.

08:08.830 --> 08:10.266

08:15.844 --> 08:17.615

It's Stacey.

08:17.615 --> 08:19.685
I just want to ask...

08:19.685 --> 08:22.290
I heard Lilli
tried on a costume.

08:22.290 --> 08:24.094

there was gonna be time.

08:24.094 --> 08:26.966
Right now, there won't be
a solo for you.

08:26.966 --> 08:29.037

Abby?

08:29.037 --> 08:30.674

08:47.340 --> 08:49.512

she's not gonna dance,

have to be here.

Yes.

12:12.183 --> 12:15.456

to find somebody

12:15.456 --> 12:18.730
that can consistently go
into a solo competition

12:18.730 --> 12:21.301
and place well, I think
that's important to Abby.

12:21.301 --> 12:23.840
I mean, Kalani placed fourth.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.177
And everybody can rag on you
for your solo record,

12:26.177 --> 12:27.948

you've placed top three

12:27.948 --> 12:29.384
every single time
you've done a solo,

12:29.384 --> 12:30.486

you did hip‐hop.
