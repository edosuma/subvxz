WEBVTT

00:09.759 --> 00:11.845
Did you hear Fillmore Grave
shut down the <i>206 Weekly?</i>

00:13.012 --> 00:14.014
Uh-uh.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.766
Yeah, the soldiers who went down there
shot up the place,

00:17.392 --> 00:18.810
scared the hell out of everyone.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.186
Not surprised.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.313
Major was the ranking officer.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.400
I was at Fillmore Graves last night.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.154
Chase Graves turned to Major
and said, "Did you guys really do this?"

00:29.571 --> 00:30.947
Major flat-out lied.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.492
Fillmore Graves is the Borg.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.871
I don't know what that means.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.914
Keep dating Ravi, you will.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.585
Speaking of Major,

00:44.502 --> 00:46.755
I'd appreciate it

00:47.213 --> 00:50.175
if you wouldn't tell him or Ravi about,
you know--

00:50.341 --> 00:51.426
Human smuggling?

00:55.096 --> 00:56.514
So, listen, um...

00:59.350 --> 01:03.354
I've been up all night thinking
about that question you asked me.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.983
If I could help those dying people,
would I? And you're right, I would.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.737
I understand why you're doing
what you're doing.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.615
And I respect your decision.

01:14.699 --> 01:15.950
Thank you.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.120
-Which is why I wanna be a part of it.
-No.

01:19.662 --> 01:22.582
No, I am not letting you
risk your life.

01:22.832 --> 01:23.833
Hey!

01:25.084 --> 01:26.711
Why is it good for you but not for me?

01:30.298 --> 01:31.549
Body! Gotta go.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.259
That's yours.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.805
Obviously, I can't scratch people.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.140
But there must be some way
for me to be helpful.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.726
Do you have giant stacks of cash
stashed somewhere?

01:41.810 --> 01:43.937
Because that's one of our
biggest problems right now.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.230
Lack of resources.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.700
-It's about damn time you showed up.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.120
I've been writing to the mayor's office
for over a year.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.913
We don't normally grant favors to people

02:01.996 --> 02:03.748
who work for notorious
criminal syndicates.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.333
I played ball.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.460
I gave you what you wanted. You owe me.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.878
You didn't give us everything we wanted.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.213
There is no money.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.339
That's a myth.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.217
Well, shoot. This was a waste of my time.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.261
Okay, no, wait. You... Wait.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.690
What if I told you
there was a pot of gold?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.942
I'd say I already know that.
That's why I'm here.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.446
There's a bus
that's transporting prisoners

02:35.530 --> 02:36.906
to the state pen in Walla Walla.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.158
State pen is worse.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.076
We'll drop you off
at Moses Lake Correctional.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.161
White-collar prison.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.746
Plus, your family's
all outside the wall, right?

02:45.498 --> 02:46.791
Think of Visiting Day.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.836
You dirty girl.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.839
Where's the money, Casper?

03:26.289 --> 03:27.582
Are you sure someone's in there?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.126
The pool of blood suggests there is.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.003
You didn't open it up yet?

03:32.921 --> 03:34.464
I was waiting for you guys.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.761
Someone's in there.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.472
A jogger found the body this morning.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.683
No witnesses, no ID,
no clue how the body got there.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.519
Time-travel murder.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.481
Perhaps the impaled knight
stepped out of the TARDIS,

03:51.564 --> 03:52.607
seconds before his death

03:55.401 --> 03:56.402
Something nerdy.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.113
It's the space-time vessel
from <i>Doctor Who.</i>

03:59.989 --> 04:01.491
Looks like a police box?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.409
Bigger on the inside?

04:05.036 --> 04:07.163
I was hoping for an answer
based more on reality.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.290
Well, I'm sure you'll find one,

04:09.832 --> 04:12.543
once the zombie medical examiner
eats the victim's brain.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.629
Anybody bring a can opener?

04:39.237 --> 04:41.489
You know, uh, not to be that guy,

04:41.572 --> 04:44.033
um, but it is a lunch "hour."

04:52.542 --> 04:54.210
Look at this.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.712
It's like he was wearing a car.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.297
I identified our victim.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.675
He was a medieval-history professor
named Garrett Drexel.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.427
According to his parents,
in his spare time

05:02.510 --> 05:04.387
he did something called, "Larpering."

05:05.013 --> 05:06.556
The parents didn't know much about it.

05:06.723 --> 05:10.018
But it sounded in your wheelhouse, so...

05:15.231 --> 05:16.482
It's actually called "LARPing"

05:16.566 --> 05:18.735
and it stands for,
"live-action role-playing."

05:18.943 --> 05:19.986
So, it's like a sex thing.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.779
What? No.

05:22.196 --> 05:23.948
No, it's like <i>D&amp;D</i>

05:24.032 --> 05:26.492
but the players physically act out
their character's actions,

05:26.659 --> 05:29.120
sometimes participating
in elaborate mock battles

05:29.370 --> 05:31.205
-and epic story lines.
-Fear not.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.166
I have slain the rodent foul.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.170
No more will his pestilent droppings

05:37.253 --> 05:39.464
threaten the purity of our tools
and provisions.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.468
And our boxes of cardboard
will forevermore go un-gnawed.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.056
I think she killed
the storage-closet mouse.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.892
'Twas a noble death. And quick.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.520
What say you, my lord?
Have you news of our quest?

05:55.229 --> 05:56.189
I'm not your lord.

05:56.355 --> 05:59.901
Thou art a most sovereign leader
tasked with protecting our kingdom.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.736
Thoust may be free of royal blood

06:01.903 --> 06:04.489
but a purer heart I've not yet known.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.450
And on my honor I will serve at thy side.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.535
It is my most solemn vow.

06:10.745 --> 06:11.996
Can you get up, please?

06:12.121 --> 06:13.206
Yes, my lord.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.875
And stop calling me, "My lord."

06:16.084 --> 06:17.085
Yes, my liege. Your grace.

06:20.379 --> 06:23.674
So, Garrett's parents gave me
the name of his LARPing group,

06:24.550 --> 06:27.220
The Guardians of Bonestorm,
and the place they hang.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.138
That seems like the best place to start.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.182
If they are acting out battles,

06:31.265 --> 06:33.226
that could be how
Garrett got himself skewered.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.479
To earth's end and back,
I will follow thee.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.442
Okay, then, um... Let's go.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.195
LARPing, huh?

06:45.196 --> 06:48.324
The thing that bugs me
about <i>D&amp;D</i> is you're just sitting.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.410
If there was a more physical version
with badass armor?

06:52.662 --> 06:53.871
That could be cool.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.340
Fie, squire!

07:04.841 --> 07:08.427
One must consume an onion bloomed
from the inside out.

07:08.511 --> 07:12.432
Seriously, though, dude, you're just
picking off all the crispy stuff.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.893
Definitely not cool. Not cool at all.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.021
I don't suppose we've gotta talk to 'em?

07:19.105 --> 07:22.525
Fear not, my lord. For both my sword
and my life are yours.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.318
You don't have a sword.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.404
Or a life, if we're being technical.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.240
I am Olivia of Seattle.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.117
Examiner of the exanimate.

07:31.242 --> 07:34.704
Vision-haver for the guard.
Zombie of the festive vessel.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.206
My lord asks that you lend an ear,

07:37.457 --> 07:40.293
and I ask that you make haste
and gather round,

07:40.710 --> 07:43.421
for his will is my most sacred destiny.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.135
Detective Babineaux, Seattle PD. Homicide.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.344
Normal talker.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.388
Tell us about Garrett Drexel.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.932
We learned he is a member of your group.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.434
So, he's done it.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.061
Sir Garrett has slain
the Great Wizard of Thrall!

07:59.187 --> 08:01.022
-Cheers.
Uh, no.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.441
Garrett was found dead this morning.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.693
-No.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.278
-Aye.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.573
Alas. Alack. A shocker.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.034
He was much beloved.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.953
Well, someone stuck a sword through him
and left him for dead.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.956
Wait. You don't think it was us?

08:19.040 --> 08:21.792
You know these swords
are totally foam, right?

08:21.876 --> 08:23.961
Yeah, plus, we all worshiped Garrett.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.713
When was the last time you saw him?

08:26.130 --> 08:27.798
He left the group after the wall went up.

08:28.174 --> 08:32.094
Didn't seem like a good idea for humans
and zombies to fight together,

08:32.178 --> 08:34.347
so Garrett and his friend Magnus

08:34.430 --> 08:38.059
left with the other zombies
to start their own zombie LARPing league.

08:39.435 --> 08:42.063
-But Garrett wasn't a zombie.
-Of course, he was.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.814
He was human.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.443
-Mmm...
-'Tis true, noble sir. Undead he was not.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.903
Doesn't make any sense.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.158
<i>♪ Sir Garrett is now underground</i>
<i>He should've run away-- ♪</i>

08:54.283 --> 08:55.326
Shut it, Chuck. Your grace,

09:01.582 --> 09:04.460
if Sir Garrett did doth portray himself
falsely a zombie

09:04.585 --> 09:07.171
whilst in battle with zombies,
who, believing him kindred,

09:07.338 --> 09:08.464
fought without care,

09:08.798 --> 09:11.592
'tis on Garrett's own shoulder
the fault doth lay, does it not?

09:11.676 --> 09:14.428
That's what I was thinking.
But in a less annoying way.

09:21.185 --> 09:23.854
Mmm.

09:24.689 --> 09:28.859
Sharing a meal as father and son.
I did miss this.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.195
You missed decades of it.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.864
I'm fairly certain
this is our seventh meal together.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.950
This is a fine establishment, son.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.202
You've done well.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.124
I wanted to give zombies
a true fine-dining experience.

09:49.797 --> 09:50.840
Enough!

09:53.009 --> 09:54.969
You are rushing through a sacrament.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.014
I want each of you to take one bite

09:58.848 --> 10:00.266
using a fork.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.895
For God has given us the tools we need,
my friends.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.064
One bite.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.819
There. Now, hold it in your mouth.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.657
And let the divine flavors linger
on your tongue

10:16.824 --> 10:19.201
until your mouth fills with glory.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.331
Savor it. Savor it!

10:24.957 --> 10:26.167
Now swallow.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.465
And repeat.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.469
Swallowing on command.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.430
That's a power that
I should never be entrusted with.

10:39.555 --> 10:44.185
Trust is a must, but turns to dust
when bellies begin to growl.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.065
My church is in desperate need of brains.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.401
I was hoping you could spare
some more for the cause.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.782
-The Lord will provide.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.158
I was trapped

10:59.533 --> 11:00.951
in a well, son,

11:01.494 --> 11:04.580
and the Lord made it rain brains.
Can you believe it?

11:06.457 --> 11:08.876
Surely a remedy will come your way.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.339
Scalpel, please.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.718
Stormrose, Warblade of the Fallen
or Lightbringer?

11:18.552 --> 11:19.929
Maybe I'll just take the bone saw.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.305
Oh.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.558
The Spineripper.
A choice most excellent.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.063
-Good morrow.
<i> Hi.</i>

11:29.146 --> 11:30.815
<i>I'm supposed to be coming to see you.</i>

11:30.898 --> 11:32.108
<i>My name is Isobel.</i>

11:33.275 --> 11:34.944
Thoust timing is poor, child.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.738
-I shall call anon.
-<i>Please! I'm in this motel in Yakima.</i>

11:37.822 --> 11:41.033
<i>My coyote left for coffee eight hours ago.</i>

11:41.117 --> 11:43.953
-<i>I'm totally freaking out.</i>
-Indeed. Yea, 'tis true.

11:44.203 --> 11:48.624
Let us discuss whilst I procure
much-needed gauze for my warted toe.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.171
Fear not, young friend.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.673
Your good coyote shall be back.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.758
Perhaps he thinks
a malefactor doth tail him.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.677
<i>I guess you need to talk in code</i>
<i>or something,</i>

11:59.760 --> 12:01.053
<i>but you're not helping.</i>

12:01.303 --> 12:02.638
<i>I'm going crazy here.</i>

12:02.763 --> 12:05.266
Fear not, lass,
for I make thee promises three.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.309
Your good coyote shall return.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.186
You shall arrive safely in Seattle.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.605
And with a scratch of my own nail,

12:11.689 --> 12:13.232
your life I shall save.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.234
This is my most solemn vow.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.570
<i>Is there someone else I can talk to?</i>

12:18.112 --> 12:19.947
<i>Isobel?</i>
<i>Wait, he's back.</i>

12:20.281 --> 12:22.616
<i>Oh, my God. Thank you so much. Bye.</i>

12:24.326 --> 12:26.871
And thus, two promises remain.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.414
Let me guess,

12:28.622 --> 12:30.541
you slayed a beastly arachnid?

12:30.666 --> 12:32.835
I say thee nay,

12:33.627 --> 12:36.380
for she was taking a phone call
most whispery.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.717
Perhaps about a certain upcoming
noble birthday?

12:41.343 --> 12:43.179
Thoust foolest me not.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.139
What news hast thou?

12:45.222 --> 12:47.224
A location for Magnus, I think.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.603
Garrett received a text every Friday
with a time, an address,

12:50.686 --> 12:52.563
and a, "Try and make it."

12:52.646 --> 12:54.940
-It was always signed, "M."
-Magnus.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.485
The address is for a warehouse
on the edge of the city.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.278
I'm guessing that's where
the zombie LARPers meet.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.655
-If you're free at midnight--
-Not free, my lord,

13:01.739 --> 13:05.242
but bound by honor to stand
between my lord and danger.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.578
Yeah. Okay.

13:09.705 --> 13:10.956
What's with the half

13:12.708 --> 13:13.792
I let her have that one.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.294
It was either that

13:15.461 --> 13:17.213
or let her stuff the chest cavity
with hay.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.553
You like to party, don't you, boy?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.639
Does Dolly Parton
sleep on her back?

13:27.848 --> 13:28.766
Look, Russ.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.559
I can't afford all this.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.895
You keep spottin' me. It ain't right.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.564
You ever need a few more coins
in your pocket, you just tell me.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.026
I'm so doggone broke, partner.
I'd do anything.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.277
Hey!

13:40.945 --> 13:43.280
Stop requesting songs
about tractors and cold beers.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.949
You're making everybody wish
they were more dead.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.409
I'm just treatin' my partner here
to a night on the town.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.037
Shoot, I'd have been knocked
into a cocked hat

13:50.120 --> 13:51.664
if it weren't for this buckaroo's loyalty.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.707
Skittles! We're a pack of wolves,
ain't we?

13:53.832 --> 13:55.000
We stick together.

13:59.046 --> 14:02.758
Show your ta-tas
to the Butcher of Bourbon Street!

14:02.841 --> 14:05.761
This man'll rip off your skull
and vomit hurricanes down your windpipe.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.471
Every man wants to be me!

14:07.638 --> 14:10.349
Every woman wants to be with me.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.396
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.649
The founder of the Zombie Thunderdome.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.860
Six feet, two inches of ferocity.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.112
Two-hundred and thirty pounds
of piss and vinegar.

14:23.195 --> 14:27.825
The massive, the mighty
Magnus the Necro-maimer.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.828
Magnus! Magnus!

14:35.165 --> 14:36.876
Now, this is an entrance.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.335
Verily.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.478
That's our guy.

15:01.775 --> 15:02.943
Whoo!

15:11.619 --> 15:13.162
Who wants blood?

15:13.245 --> 15:15.998
Who wants grievous injuries?

15:16.498 --> 15:18.918
Reckon I ought to shake
the snake before it starts.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.210
Don't fall in, partner.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.047
Who wants me to see me
turn this chop steak

15:23.130 --> 15:24.673
into ground beef?

15:24.757 --> 15:28.052
How's he gonna be a butcher
when I slice his arms off?

15:28.135 --> 15:30.262
I hope the floor
doesn't mind getting wet...

15:30.346 --> 15:32.598
With the Butcher's blood!

15:45.069 --> 15:46.987
There is no honor in this?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.823
No, probably not.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.120
Ooh.

16:01.168 --> 16:02.670
-Yeah!

16:10.719 --> 16:11.720
Who are you?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.639
Detective Babineaux, Seattle PD.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.641
I'd like to talk to you
about Garrett Drexel.

16:15.724 --> 16:18.477
Yeah, now is when I bask
in the glow of victory, so bugger off.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.187
That isn't really an option here.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.480
Oh, it's not?

16:22.356 --> 16:24.233
You looking to get knocked
on your ass too?

16:24.566 --> 16:27.861
If my lord seeks an audience,
it would serve you well

16:27.945 --> 16:29.279
to make time.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.864
Okay.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.825
Let's talk Garrett Drexel.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.244
-He's dead.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.745
A sword right through his belly.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.622
-But he was...
-Garrett was human.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.250
They call me Liv, the medical examiner.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.336
I examined the body myself,
no zombie was he.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.092
Uh... Sit, please.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.594
Yeah, on the...

17:03.731 --> 17:06.316
Why would Garrett pretend to be a zombie?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.193
It kind of makes sense
when I think about it.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.362
Garrett was super pumped
when he realized that zombies

17:10.446 --> 17:11.572
would be fighting with real swords.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.240
But you saw a business opportunity.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.616
Sure did.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.201
I knew right away
that people would pay money

17:16.285 --> 17:17.870
to see zombies make each other bleed.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.415
So I broke away from the zombie LARPers
and started Zombie Thunderdome.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.251
Do you know where we could find
the zombie LARPing group?

17:24.334 --> 17:26.378
Yeah, I have their schedule
in my phone somewhere.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.715
His group was called the Shadow Exiles.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.687
Any day hence.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.441
God, I wanna make you break character.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.817
Oh, here it is.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.904
Looks like they don't fight
again for another month

17:51.987 --> 17:54.573
but, uh, they should be at
the league rules meeting tomorrow.
-Ye Olde Microbrewery.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.994
I'm the bouncer.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.997
I'll wait in the car.

18:08.128 --> 18:11.131
His maiden is a zombie
and, alas, he is not.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.884
'Tis a cruel world.

18:25.562 --> 18:26.814
Is this the way it's gonna be?

18:26.897 --> 18:28.899
Everyone's asking me
why you're moping around today.

18:28.982 --> 18:32.319
You didn't really expect me
to be happy today, did you?

18:33.362 --> 18:34.738
No...

18:35.405 --> 18:38.242
But we were up until 4:30
talking about this.

18:38.575 --> 18:41.411
-And I felt like we were okay.
-We are.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.831
See, I knew this was coming down
the pipe, but...

18:44.790 --> 18:45.999
It hurts.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.419
But, we're still us, we're good,

18:49.503 --> 18:51.797
it was just medicinal.

18:52.756 --> 18:53.924
Like it was for you.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.136
Somehow that doesn't help.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.309
Cowboy brains are permanently 86'ed,

19:04.393 --> 19:09.606
which is weird 'cause I'd think
cowboys are to hookers as...

19:12.234 --> 19:15.362
-Exactly.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.364
I hear "cowboy," I think <i>Deadwood.</i>

19:17.447 --> 19:19.408
But, Blaine, there was no dead wood.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.368
These cowpokes didn't want no pokes.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.078
Here's where we went wrong.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.913
Look at the fine print.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.084
"Professional Born Again Riders
of America.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.545
"We tell the devil to buck off"?

19:31.628 --> 19:33.547
What is this, six

19:33.630 --> 19:35.340
Where do we stand on new muscle? It's handled, I already hired Carl.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.053
Crybaby Carl.

19:40.804 --> 19:45.142
I would rather put
a volleyball on Dino's body.

19:45.225 --> 19:48.812
It's a medical condition, Blaine,
the guy's got faulty tear ducts.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.481
He's actually a sociopath in a good way.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.781
So who do I have to bang
to get a hot toddy?

20:08.582 --> 20:10.417
So what brings you
to our fair walled

20:10.834 --> 20:11.960
Cobain Museum?

20:12.252 --> 20:14.338
The fish market, the coffee?

20:14.838 --> 20:17.090
I've been keeping tabs
on my former money launderer,

20:17.174 --> 20:18.759
Casper Connor, while he's in prison.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.803
He has a major stash of my money
hidden away somewhere,

20:21.887 --> 20:23.805
and I've been eager to find out
where it is.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.599
I've tried getting to him on the inside,

20:25.682 --> 20:27.434
but the schmuck hides in solitary.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.603
I haven't been able to get to him

20:29.686 --> 20:30.812
and that's where you come in.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.106
-A little bird tells me

20:33.190 --> 20:36.360
the state pen has agreed
to take 20 of Seattle's worst criminals.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.362
They're bussing them down to Walla Walla.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.615
And for some reason, candy-ass Casper
is gonna be in that bus.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.910
We're gonna break him out
and get my money back.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.289
Out of a prison transport bus?

20:49.373 --> 20:51.166
We'll go halfsies on the cash, of course.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.251
Not thirdsies?

20:52.626 --> 20:55.921
So after the three of us
take down this prison bus,

20:56.004 --> 20:58.131
how about we go the backyard
and dig a hole to China?

20:58.715 --> 20:59.925
What's the problem, Blaine?

21:00.008 --> 21:04.304
I can't commandeer a prison bus
full of convicts and armed guards.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.722
I don't have that kind of manpower.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.474
You call yourself a crime boss?

21:07.975 --> 21:11.061
You should have an army
of nameless, faceless yes-men

21:11.144 --> 21:14.147
who are too stupid to do anything
but listen to you.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.066
Blaine, what about...

21:17.276 --> 21:21.530
We don't have an army full of
stupid, nameless, faceless yes-men

21:22.698 --> 21:24.449
but we know someone who does.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.492
Brother Love.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.952
That's right, Don E.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.620
Brother Love.

21:29.413 --> 21:33.292
The Lord spoke to you
about a prison transport bus?

21:33.875 --> 21:35.085
Not directly.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.588
I was trying to solve
your brain shortage problem

21:39.172 --> 21:41.550
and I reached a point
where I'd feared I'd fail you.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.554
And in that desperate moment,
I humbled myself and I said, "God."

21:45.637 --> 21:48.015
Not out loud, more with my heart--

21:48.098 --> 21:50.142
There is no right or wrong way.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.560
Well, I said, "God,

21:51.810 --> 21:53.979
"please, show me a sign."

21:55.314 --> 21:56.690
And in that moment,

21:56.982 --> 21:58.942
hand to the man upstairs,

21:59.026 --> 22:01.570
is when my phone rang
and my buddy tells me about the bus.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.239
I felt the Holy Spirit move me.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.992
I didn't even know
whose number I was dialing.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.036
When Blaine answered, I said,

22:09.119 --> 22:11.830
"Of course, it had to be Blaine."

22:13.290 --> 22:15.667
There will be guards, and guns.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.919
I fear I'd be leading
my flock to slaughter.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.338
We'll take 'em by surprise.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.299
-They won't even see us coming.
-The authorities will come after us.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.343
We're not strong enough yet.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.927
No one will raise a finger.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.014
You see, these are wicked men.

22:29.890 --> 22:33.685
And giving their brains to needy zombies
will be the one good thing

22:33.769 --> 22:36.146
they do with their miserable lives.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.531
Yo, Russ.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.867
You wanna win some more money off me?

22:48.950 --> 22:50.911
-I'm feeling unlucky.
-Nah, I don't think so.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.746
Everything okay? Last night.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.627
What were you telling that cop?

22:58.710 --> 22:59.753
"Cop"?

22:59.961 --> 23:01.296
I didn't talk to a cop.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.632
I saw it, bro.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.467
The blonde zombie
that works for the police.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.010
She's a medical examiner, I think.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.596
Look, man, I just saw a pretty girl,
was chatting her up.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.144
Yeah.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.771
So, you free to meet up tonight?

23:17.854 --> 23:19.648
-Sure.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.483
-You know it.
-Cool.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.236
I'll text you the address,
we can meet there.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.154
-Yeah.
-And, uh...

23:26.238 --> 23:27.489
And what we're doing,

23:28.573 --> 23:29.783
it's not exactly legal.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.326
I ain't dumb, son.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.502
Thank you.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.508
Good morrow.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.010
Uh... Hi.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.596
It was a bit of a rough trip,
but this is Beth,

23:51.680 --> 23:52.848
and that's Geo.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.475
Guys, this is Renegade.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.895
'Tis an honor, fair lady,

23:59.521 --> 24:02.983
to return thine most noble soul
from the edge of the abyss.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.569
Renegade, maybe let's just
cut to the scratch.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.112
It was a long trip in the trunk.

24:08.738 --> 24:12.742
Beth of Columbus, I welcome you
to the brotherhood of zombies.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.412
Live undead with a true heart.

24:16.037 --> 24:17.664
And do naught but good.

24:22.878 --> 24:26.423
I feel new, strong.
I don't know how to thank you.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.842
We don't know how to thank you.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.303
'Tis a gift we received equally, milady.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.268
Geo of the Bay Area.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.478
I welcome you into the brotherhood
of zombies.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.564
Live undead with a true heart.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.608
And do naught but good.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.947
I'm gonna cry.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.033
I didn't think that would happen.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.118
I'm really grateful.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.581
There was supposed to be a third.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.875
Lady Isobel, I made a vow.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.920
Yeah, Isobel hasn't arrived yet,
she should be here by now.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.922
With which coyote doth she travel?

25:07.005 --> 25:08.590
She's with the new guy, Curtis.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.261
Ready to get your hands dirty?

25:56.554 --> 25:58.306
Born ready.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.226
Let's go pay some folks a visit.

26:24.165 --> 26:27.127
I think we need to readjust
the brain-to-gelatin ratio.

26:27.377 --> 26:28.420
It's all spilling out.

26:28.503 --> 26:31.381
No, you gotta fold the top over
before you staple it, idiot.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.178
No, man!
These are our tubes, we bought 'em.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.430
We're just repackaging them.

26:38.513 --> 26:40.807
Please, no.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.354
Nice.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.899
I should probably make
an example out of you, don't you think?

26:49.983 --> 26:51.943
-No.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.320
What do you think, Major?

26:53.403 --> 26:54.487
Waste him?

26:55.238 --> 26:57.282
-Calling it.
-Heads, we waste him.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.122
Tails.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.840
And there won't be a next time.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.091
Will there? No.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.889
Put those axes to use, boys.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.574
Liv, my love.

27:39.657 --> 27:40.909
Can I get your number?

27:40.992 --> 27:42.786
Where are the zombie LARPers we seek?

27:44.120 --> 27:45.538
There are the heroes, B.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.333
Hoisting half-pints of low-carb lager.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.960
My liege, shall we?

27:57.217 --> 27:59.219
You are Sir Clive Babineaux.

27:59.302 --> 28:02.514
Zombie slayer, survivor
of the pits of Max Rager.

28:02.972 --> 28:04.307
Cracker of suspects,

28:04.391 --> 28:06.726
and daydream lover
of the women of Precinct Nine.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.478
Forget it not, yea.

28:08.728 --> 28:09.938
Verily.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.314
Thanks, Liv.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.359
I'll pull my head out.

28:20.782 --> 28:25.120
You're the Shadow Exiles.
Clive Babineaux, Seattle PD, Homicide.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.457
I take it you know why I'm here.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.126
It's about Garrett, isn't it?

28:31.209 --> 28:33.044
Yes, Garrett. The guy you left for dead
out in the park.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.258
We thought he was a zombie.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.510
-Like us, and--
-We understand it was a secret

28:40.593 --> 28:42.095
that Garrett was human.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.264
Just tell us exactly what happened.

28:44.806 --> 28:48.017
We've been acting out Arthurian legends
for the last couple of months.

28:48.351 --> 28:51.938
Garrett was the best fighter,
so, of course, he was Lancelot.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.942
When that sword went through him,
Garrett bled like a stuck pig.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.362
We were all standing there, dumbstruck.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.406
It made no sense for a zombie
to bleed like that.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.659
Before we could even figure out
what was happening,

29:04.868 --> 29:06.369
Garrett was dead.

29:08.163 --> 29:12.417
It happened so fast, no one knew
what to do, we all just panicked.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.462
No one knew
if what we were doing was legal.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.714
It's true, we all panicked.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.050
But I was the one
who struck the fatal blow.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.761
Then you must be Arthur.

29:23.136 --> 29:26.765
In one life.
In the other, I'm known as Kevin Kreeger.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.392
It was an accident, darling.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.061
My husband loved Garrett.

29:32.353 --> 29:33.688
We all did.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.774
Guinevere, I presume.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.818
Yes, but also Cathy Kreeger.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.947
You all need to come down
to the station in the morning.

29:43.239 --> 29:45.784
I need to take a statement
from everyone who was there.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.370
Killing Garrett was unintentional.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.499
But leaving his body was a crime.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.709
My wife wasn't even at the battle.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.086
Well, I'll still need you to come down
to give a statement.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.133
I'm really tempted to not come back.

30:02.509 --> 30:03.843
New Seattle blows.

30:05.094 --> 30:07.096
I guess I would have to end things
with my fiance.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.311
What the hell?

30:17.232 --> 30:18.441
See why I hate this place?

30:23.571 --> 30:24.864
We will rise,

30:25.198 --> 30:26.741
and they will drown.

30:30.119 --> 30:33.373
The meals on the bus go down, down, down!

30:34.582 --> 30:37.502
Fear not, killers. Fear not, rapists.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.629
It is to a better place you go.

30:41.464 --> 30:44.968
The digestive tract of a hungry zombie.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.514
It will be over soon. Submit! Submit!

30:51.307 --> 30:52.559
-Go, go!
-Go, go, go!

31:02.694 --> 31:05.238
Brothers and sisters, feed!

31:05.947 --> 31:08.449
Feed to your hearts' content.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.286
Those are some good minions.

31:11.494 --> 31:14.789
Rejoice, my friends. Rejoice!

31:15.123 --> 31:17.166
Feast to your hearts' content.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.419
It's a medical condition, Blaine.

31:19.752 --> 31:20.753
Still... It's glandular.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.424
Nothing I can do about it.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.801
Have him go kill someone.
Here, I'll do it.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.177
Crybaby Carl,

31:29.137 --> 31:30.597
go kill somebody on that bus.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.515
Crybaby, stop.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.976
Oh. One of them's getting away.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.105
Is that your accountant guy?

31:39.230 --> 31:40.064
Not him. Cool beans.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.694
They're eating that guy's brains
right out of his head.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.321
They didn't even kill him first.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.364
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.657
His legs are moving.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.659
I think that's a nervous-system thing.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.621
Now he's definitely dead.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.873
Oop. No, wait.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.083
-Okay, now.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.881
Please.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.092
Please, don't eat me. I'll do anything.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.595
Tell me the truth, Casper.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.348
What's scarier, them or me?

32:13.640 --> 32:15.475
Stacey, please.

32:15.975 --> 32:17.769
Don't let them eat me, I'm begging you.

32:17.977 --> 32:21.022
You had a lot to say to the DA's office
about my operation.

32:21.731 --> 32:24.359
But when I want to know
where my money is, you're silent.

32:24.609 --> 32:25.818
Okay, you can take it.

32:26.527 --> 32:27.695
It's in locker 220.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.781
It's at the ferry terminal,
it's on Colman.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.658
Please, just let me go!

32:35.578 --> 32:36.412
Thanks.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.207
But I'd rather get it
straight from the horse's brain.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.919
This is Blaine.
He'll be eating you tonight.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.047
Crybaby, do what you do, man.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.551
No. No, no!

32:54.681 --> 32:57.392
Please, don't eat me. No!

33:05.149 --> 33:06.317
You can stop doing that.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.236
I spoke to his family. They don't want it.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.655
And with the investigation over,
they said we could just trash it.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.615
A sad end for such a valiant man.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.368
You're lucky your maiden fair
never caught his eye.

33:15.451 --> 33:18.204
Uh, hello?
Undercover with the zombie truthers.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.123
Yes, but our Peyton's fantasy life

33:20.206 --> 33:22.542
revolves entirely around
knights in shining armor.

33:22.917 --> 33:24.210
Fortune has smiled on you.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.212
Count thyself blessed.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.680
So you have no idea where Isobel is?

33:36.139 --> 33:37.932
Is there any chance
that coyote got her into Seattle

33:38.016 --> 33:40.143
-I knoweth not.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.061
I await news from Sir Levon.

33:42.770 --> 33:43.896
A-ha!

33:45.940 --> 33:46.774
How could you?

33:50.653 --> 33:51.779
Whoa. What do you see?

33:52.697 --> 33:54.991
Guinevere cheating on King Arthur.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.160
With Lancelot, I presume.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.119
Verily.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.579
I must away.

34:04.542 --> 34:07.003
I know this sounds like

34:07.378 --> 34:08.963
some kind of role-play come-on...

34:09.047 --> 34:12.216
Um, but I literally can't figure out
how to take this off.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.470
Let me see what we can do.

34:23.102 --> 34:26.564
You're a human, and you were
sleeping with Garrett/Lancelot.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.735
That means King Arthur/your husband
knew that Garrett was human, too.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.986
It's not what you think.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.905
Well, that's good, Guinevere,
because what I think

34:33.988 --> 34:36.949
is that your husband, King Arthur,
murdered your lover, Lancelot.

34:37.450 --> 34:41.162
You do know that when LARPing
you are free to change the endings.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.873
I love my husband.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.750
And my husband loves me.

34:45.875 --> 34:48.002
But after Kevin became a zombie--

34:48.086 --> 34:50.379
A bed-swerver ye became.

34:51.214 --> 34:53.216
I thought that our love was strong enough.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.635
You know, that sex wasn't everything.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.222
But it became clear how important it was.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.350
You know what intimacy does for a couple?

35:03.226 --> 35:04.811
How lack of it tears them apart?

35:04.894 --> 35:08.940
My liege and lord has faced down
similar demons and yet not a murder one.

35:10.316 --> 35:13.277
He and his zombie lover
allow others to share their bed.

35:13.402 --> 35:14.403
Liv! Has that worked for you?

35:19.659 --> 35:21.953
It hasn't been the easiest thing.

35:23.704 --> 35:24.789
I wouldn't think so.

35:25.581 --> 35:26.499
Look, Detective,

35:26.958 --> 35:31.420
even if my husband wanted to kill Garrett,
it had to be a freak accident.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.215
First of all, Garrett is
the greatest swordsman in Seattle.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.551
It's a fluke that Kevin even touched him.

35:37.176 --> 35:40.096
Also, Kevin fights with Excalibur,
a broadsword.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.807
If you wanted to kill someone
wearing chain mail,

35:42.890 --> 35:46.144
you wouldn't use a broadsword,
you'd use something super pointy.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.021
Something like...

35:51.566 --> 35:52.400
This?

35:57.196 --> 35:58.281
That's not Excalibur.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.035
Galahad, the pure of heart.

36:03.828 --> 36:04.662
Steve. Steve!

36:08.374 --> 36:09.417
We're ready for you.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.715
Mr. Kreeger, here's what we know.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.509
We know you were aware
that Garrett was human

36:18.593 --> 36:21.220
because you caught him
cheating with your human wife.

36:21.470 --> 36:22.930
You didn't fight with Excalibur,

36:23.139 --> 36:25.016
a blade synonymous with King Arthur.

36:25.349 --> 36:28.853
Instead you chose to fight with a sword
that could pierce chain mail.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.814
-And according to Galahad--
-The pure of heart.

36:32.064 --> 36:35.818
During the fight, you tricked Lancelot
into thinking that you had been injured.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.238
When Lancelot
let down his guard to assist you,

36:39.405 --> 36:41.532
you thrust a sword through his gut.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.075
You fought without honor.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.580
When he slept with my wife,
he ceded his honor card.

36:48.456 --> 36:49.540
You had to trick him

36:50.374 --> 36:52.043
because he was a better fighter than you.

36:54.378 --> 36:59.050
A better fighter, better lover.
Certainly better-looking, younger.

37:00.885 --> 37:01.969
And yet here I am.

37:02.553 --> 37:03.638
Still alive.

37:03.804 --> 37:05.348
And I'll serve no prison time.

37:05.806 --> 37:06.891
I admit nothing.

37:07.808 --> 37:09.477
We were LARPers playing a game, and...

37:09.852 --> 37:12.730
Garrett pretended to be a zombie,
and that's how he got himself killed.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.233
That's what a jury will believe.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.859
So you can keep your pad, Detective.

37:20.988 --> 37:24.533
I can't believe my former accountant
actually told us the real location.

37:24.951 --> 37:27.453
He just seemed eager to impress
in his final moments,

37:27.536 --> 37:29.247
and my vision was clear as day.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.539
Locker 220,

37:30.957 --> 37:33.292
at the ferry station on Colman.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.171
Come to Daddy.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.597
Disappointing.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.225
I don't understand.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.018
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

37:51.102 --> 37:55.773
I saw Carter put a black duffle bag
full of money in this locker.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.149
Well, then where the hell is it?

37:57.942 --> 37:59.860
Liv, you can't just bring new people here.

38:00.027 --> 38:01.112
You put everyone at risk.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.571
New people need to be vetted.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.741
New to you, good sir.
But to me, a lifetime of loyalty.

38:07.493 --> 38:08.995
I come bearing gifts.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.336
Consider Lady Peyton vetted.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.505
Think of those who will benefit from this.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.425
All the people
we weren't able to bring in before.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.483
It's all right.

38:41.819 --> 38:42.653
Come on in.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.285
There were some hiccups.

38:49.368 --> 38:50.911
A couple of the guards
along the north wall

38:50.995 --> 38:52.663
decided what we bribed them isn't enough.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.290
We had to find another route.

38:54.874 --> 38:55.833
She was a champ.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.377
I'm so glad we made it.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.463
It was such a crazy drama getting here.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.798
I couldn't handle a Wally World situation.

39:03.257 --> 39:06.677
"Zombie park's closed. Walrus out front
should've told ya."

39:14.352 --> 39:15.478
Let's do this.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.480
I'm tired of being sick.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.317
'Tis with the proudest of hearts

39:21.400 --> 39:24.111
that I shall fulfill
the third of my promises three.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.280
Uh... Great.

39:27.490 --> 39:28.449
Quick question.

39:28.574 --> 39:31.452
Do all zombies talk like you,
or do you, like,

39:31.535 --> 39:33.412
actually work at a Ren Faire?

39:36.540 --> 39:37.750
Isobel of Idaho,

39:38.751 --> 39:40.586
I welcome you
to the brotherhood of zombies.

39:41.962 --> 39:44.215
Live undead with a true heart.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.510
And do naught but good.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.529
Uh...

40:07.530 --> 40:09.240
How long does it take to kick in?

40:16.747 --> 40:19.834
It's usually pretty immediate.
Try the other arm.

40:22.002 --> 40:24.463
Yeah, maybe it's like a vein thing.

40:31.303 --> 40:32.680
-Isobel of Idaho--
Liv!

40:32.763 --> 40:34.348
Whoa. "Renegade."

40:34.432 --> 40:35.474
Sorry.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.894
Go a little deeper this time.

40:51.949 --> 40:52.992
Maybe do her neck.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.326
Have you eaten today?

40:59.039 --> 41:00.374
I don't understand.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.762
I'm gonna die,

41:14.430 --> 41:15.264
aren't I?
