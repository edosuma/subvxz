WEBVTT

00:00.068 --> 00:01.859
Okay, so last time y'all saw Star.

00:01.862 --> 00:03.847
I just went up in that
board meeting and got fired.

00:03.849 --> 00:05.145
They got a new head coming in,

00:05.147 --> 00:06.714
and she's a bad bitch.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.950
Yeah, I got to see my probation
officer once a week.

00:08.951 --> 00:12.053
And then I got to pay back
Elliot the 20 stacks I stole.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.654
Carlotta Brown, meet Ayanna Floyd,

00:13.655 --> 00:15.123
the president of y'all label.

00:15.124 --> 00:16.724
My girls have been working
really hard since...

00:16.725 --> 00:19.627
Set up an appointment with my assistant.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.496
- I like your shoes, baby.
- Come up off 'em.

00:21.497 --> 00:24.065
- I ain't giving y'all nothing.
- Yes, you is.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.500
Hey, doll. It's Arlene.

00:25.501 --> 00:27.068
They know about those girls
you set free.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.724
They're coming for you.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:43.552 --> 00:45.553
It's a great day in Miami.

00:45.554 --> 00:48.055
Partly cloudy with low humidity.
What a great day...

00:58.372 --> 01:00.331
_

01:00.410 --> 01:03.834
_

01:05.202 --> 01:06.887
_

01:06.889 --> 01:10.664
_

01:11.211 --> 01:13.479
_

01:14.846 --> 01:16.523
Come on, brother.

01:17.140 --> 01:19.593
_

01:20.476 --> 01:22.034
And you know what, I'm betting
that maybe you had it

01:22.036 --> 01:24.625
smuggled here from Peru when
you set up shop here in Miami.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.987
So here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you

01:25.989 --> 01:27.795
three seconds to tell me where it is

01:27.797 --> 01:30.592
before I paint these walls
with the inside of your head.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.341
Where's my damn money?

01:40.342 --> 01:41.877
Stop!

01:50.778 --> 01:52.186
What's up, nephew?

01:52.817 --> 01:55.996
You're supposed to be dead.

01:55.998 --> 01:58.194
That's what I wanted people to think.

01:58.196 --> 01:59.934
- Now I need my money.
- Then you're gonna have to

01:59.935 --> 02:01.355
kill me then, 'cause that money
is gone, Jahil.

02:01.357 --> 02:03.070
I'm not leaving here
empty-handed, Javier.

02:03.071 --> 02:05.373
You want to take something?!
Take your freaking nephew then, huh?!

02:05.374 --> 02:08.110
'Cause he's doing nothing but
taking up space aquÃ­ anyway.

02:13.548 --> 02:16.018
Hell of a reunion.

02:43.779 --> 02:48.309
Synced and corrected by johnyd13

02:49.384 --> 02:50.751
- Carlotta.
- Yeah?

02:50.752 --> 02:52.219
Where you at?

02:52.220 --> 02:53.296
I'm here.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.769
We never get to come in here.

02:54.771 --> 02:55.810
It's cool.

02:55.812 --> 02:57.279
It's like Lord of the Wigs in here.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.397
Shut up.

02:59.399 --> 03:01.716
See, that's why this room is off limits.

03:01.717 --> 03:03.385
Miss C, what is you and Miss Bruce's

03:03.386 --> 03:05.253
obsession with wigs all about?

03:05.254 --> 03:07.656
It's not a wig obsession.

03:07.657 --> 03:09.157
It's a attitude.

03:09.158 --> 03:10.859
A lifestyle.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.615
- Okay.
- See, this girl right here,

03:12.617 --> 03:14.873
she's telling you, "I'm mellow."

03:14.875 --> 03:17.833
"I'm-I'm just relaxed.
Everything is all good."

03:17.834 --> 03:20.035
- But this one right here...
- Mm.

03:20.036 --> 03:23.206
- She's like, "I'm feeling myself."
- Uh-huh.

03:23.208 --> 03:26.174
"I'm ready to hit the club,
get my groove on."

03:26.175 --> 03:28.243
"See what's going on out there."

03:28.244 --> 03:30.679
Looks like you haven't worn
that one in a while.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.948
Yeah, you right. Give it
to Miss Bruce for a makeover.

03:32.949 --> 03:35.884
And, uh, what about this one?

03:37.107 --> 03:39.346
- Scare the hell out of a bitch.
- I can tell.

03:39.348 --> 03:41.441
Come on, who coming
for you wearing this?

03:41.443 --> 03:43.881
- Not I.
- Not one person.

03:43.883 --> 03:46.133
Little bouncy.

03:46.135 --> 03:49.004
Y'all know we got to be on point
for this meeting, right?

03:49.005 --> 03:51.273
- Yeah, we know.
- Do you?

03:51.274 --> 03:54.042
I mean, when is the last time
you had to impress a label head?

03:54.043 --> 03:56.278
This is an out-of-date conversation,

03:56.279 --> 03:58.446
because labels are old-school.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.715
That's not what people care
about anymore; it's about views

04:00.716 --> 04:03.118
and uploads and likes on the Internet.

04:03.119 --> 04:06.121
- The music game is changing.
- It ain't changing that quick.

04:06.122 --> 04:07.923
You still got to play the game.

04:07.924 --> 04:11.092
Ayanna Floyd ain't no joke,
so just follow my lead in there.

04:11.093 --> 04:13.495
- Yes, ma'am.
- Carlotta, how's it feel being

04:13.496 --> 04:15.797
on the other side of things now?

04:18.100 --> 04:21.101
Feels good.

04:35.351 --> 04:37.152
I don't give a damn. You're my lawyer.

04:37.153 --> 04:40.255
That's what I pay you for.

04:40.256 --> 04:42.157
Fix it or you're fired.

04:59.909 --> 05:01.943
- Go.
- Earvin left word this morning.

05:01.944 --> 05:04.079
- He said it was urgent.
- Do you have my latte?

05:04.080 --> 05:05.613
What kind of question is that?

05:05.614 --> 05:07.716
Skinny, easy foam.

05:07.717 --> 05:08.950
What's on tap today?

05:08.951 --> 05:10.485
Well, the marketing team,
they want to sit down

05:10.486 --> 05:12.454
and talk about strategy.
I told them not to come up

05:12.455 --> 05:15.323
with those trash-ass PowerPoint
presentations anymore.

05:15.324 --> 05:17.759
Saw the mock-up. They don't
grasp the direction of Midtown.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.461
- Arrange a meeting.
- Will do.

05:19.462 --> 05:22.097
- What's next?
- Carlotta Brown has been in your office

05:22.098 --> 05:23.932
for about 30 minutes.
She's with Big Trouble.

05:23.933 --> 05:26.935
- Listen, I ain't trying to be petty...
- Then don't.

05:26.936 --> 05:30.171
I don't understand how the winners of
Atlanta's NextFest fit into our pedigree.

05:30.172 --> 05:32.739
It's not for you to understand.

05:33.084 --> 05:35.611
- Are we clear?
- As vodka.

05:38.314 --> 05:41.182
That exit never gets old.

05:45.114 --> 05:46.647
So, what do you think?

05:46.648 --> 05:48.783
You won a talent show.

05:48.784 --> 05:51.917
And although your sound
is decent, it's not distinct.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.554
Excuse me?

05:53.555 --> 05:56.040
Crane, your father came out
of the gate swinging.

05:56.042 --> 05:58.444
I can name every song
on his debut album.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.813
- You don't have that, sweetheart.
- That's because

06:00.814 --> 06:02.581
he whored himself out
and licensed every cut.

06:02.582 --> 06:05.017
No, it's because his album was curated

06:05.018 --> 06:07.256
on the pureness of his sound.

06:07.258 --> 06:09.065
Well, have you listened
to all the music?

06:09.067 --> 06:12.691
I've heard all of their music.
Their lyrics are uninspired.

06:12.692 --> 06:14.927
I'm not saying
that every track has to be

06:14.928 --> 06:16.996
Winehouse, Joplin, or Mary J,

06:16.997 --> 06:19.265
but until the lyrical pool
they're swimming in is deeper,

06:19.266 --> 06:20.900
that's my thought.

06:20.901 --> 06:23.035
I know you just got here,
but we been here for five months

06:23.036 --> 06:25.337
and we have nothing to show
for it. That's my thoughts.

06:25.338 --> 06:27.039
We have an expiration date. I know that.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.875
If we don't get our studio
time in, we're done.

06:29.876 --> 06:32.211
We're not just gonna let you do that.

06:32.212 --> 06:34.280
You're very low
on my list of priorities.

06:34.281 --> 06:36.297
So we may or may not be here?

06:36.299 --> 06:37.653
They need an image rebranding,

06:37.655 --> 06:39.585
and that Rachel Dolezal
look's got to go.

06:39.586 --> 06:42.021
- Really?
- Yeah, really. Simone,

06:42.022 --> 06:44.790
your unique shape needs to be
handled more delicately.

06:44.791 --> 06:46.849
- Carlotta?
- I'm speaking.

06:48.627 --> 06:50.596
We need to make sure
that you're not accentuating

06:50.597 --> 06:51.935
what you don't have.

06:51.937 --> 06:54.033
Alex, you're a bit of an ice queen.

06:54.034 --> 06:56.302
Image is everything, especially
when I can go out on YouTube

06:56.303 --> 06:58.637
and get the next Ed Sheeran,
so warm it up.

06:58.638 --> 07:00.906
Look, you and I
can discuss the image later.

07:00.907 --> 07:03.475
- Where does that leave us for now?
- On my label.

07:03.476 --> 07:05.911
And the last I checked,
being on any label

07:05.912 --> 07:08.314
as a talent show winner is a good look.

07:08.315 --> 07:10.082
So it's not nothing.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.418
For now.

07:12.919 --> 07:15.055
Thanks for coming in.

07:18.584 --> 07:20.657
I heard you this morning
on the phone with Elliot.

07:20.659 --> 07:21.894
Thought y'all were done.

07:21.895 --> 07:23.729
He found out the terms of my probation

07:23.730 --> 07:26.332
- and offered me a job.
- So he done got you locked up

07:26.333 --> 07:28.334
for stealing and then
gonna offer you a job?

07:28.335 --> 07:30.502
I don't even know how the hell
I'm supposed to trust him.

07:30.503 --> 07:32.671
It's a setup. Bitch, don't do it.

07:32.672 --> 07:34.707
Unless you want him back.

07:34.708 --> 07:37.276
Quit slamming doors in here.

07:37.277 --> 07:39.012
This is a business.

07:40.847 --> 07:42.915
Put them dirty towels in this trash bag.

07:42.916 --> 07:45.251
Alexandra, clean the sinks out.

07:45.252 --> 07:47.599
- Where's Carlotta?
- At the label,

07:47.601 --> 07:49.855
trying to make
the new president like us.

07:49.856 --> 07:52.224
Or not hate every song
I've ever written.

07:52.225 --> 07:54.927
- What you buying now?
- None of your business.

07:54.928 --> 07:57.062
That's not gonna make you
feel better about us.

07:57.063 --> 07:58.465
It might.

08:00.133 --> 08:02.968
Bruce, she really tore us apart.

08:02.969 --> 08:04.837
She said I looked like Rachel Dolezal.

08:04.838 --> 08:07.473
- Who is that?
- The point is, Bruce,

08:07.474 --> 08:09.475
this lady is vicious
and she don't like us.

08:09.476 --> 08:12.478
And she can end us any time she wants.

08:12.479 --> 08:15.047
Carlotta your manager, right?
Let her manage.

08:15.048 --> 08:17.850
That's your problem... you want
to control every damn thing.

08:17.851 --> 08:20.886
It don't matter
who's managing me, Bruce.

08:20.887 --> 08:23.555
I'm not gonna stop
looking out for myself.

08:23.556 --> 08:26.659
Ayanna said she can go online
and find new artists.

08:26.660 --> 08:30.763
There are bomb-ass singers
popping up everywhere, every day.

08:30.764 --> 08:32.765
So what if she finds us?

08:32.765 --> 08:34.400
What do you mean, find us?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.869
We been at that label,
what, five months?

08:36.870 --> 08:39.005
They're not gonna get us
with any producers.

08:39.006 --> 08:40.573
They're not gonna shoot a video for us.

08:40.573 --> 08:42.341
We got our own songs.
Why don't we shoot our own?

08:42.342 --> 08:44.841
We don't have money for a music video.

08:44.843 --> 08:47.046
We know a couple dudes in
Atlanta we can finesse

08:47.047 --> 08:49.081
to bring out their cameras
and shoot something.

08:49.082 --> 08:51.751
Did you not hear her say
she didn't like my music?

08:51.752 --> 08:54.020
I'm telling you, if we take
that song and we shoot

08:54.021 --> 08:58.124
a little 2000s cheap video,
people will watch it.

08:58.125 --> 09:00.226
It's not just one thing
this lady doesn't like about us.

09:00.227 --> 09:01.994
She has a whole list.

09:01.995 --> 09:03.859
What else she say?

09:04.644 --> 09:07.833
She said that I'm cold.

09:07.834 --> 09:09.201
You is.

09:09.202 --> 09:11.004
And that we need a new look.

09:13.769 --> 09:15.322
You do.

09:16.699 --> 09:19.478
Look, if y'all trying to get
this lady attention,

09:19.479 --> 09:21.481
you need to switch it up.

09:22.983 --> 09:25.986
Nah. I'm good.

09:28.021 --> 09:30.656
Ornery ass. Sit down.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.091
What?

09:32.092 --> 09:34.016
I'm about to teach you
how to slay this bitch.

09:34.018 --> 09:35.996
Oh, God.

09:37.347 --> 09:39.078
Ain't nothing wrong
with wigs and weaves.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.847
- Girl, I got to see this.
- We got scissors.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.549
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

09:43.550 --> 09:45.292
Girl, turn around. Ain't nobody
finna cut your hair.

09:45.294 --> 09:46.852
Cut it! Make it look like yours.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.854
You better shut up.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.856
Let's talk about family.

09:50.857 --> 09:54.526
My moms said she's
supposed to come at 1:00.

09:54.527 --> 09:57.730
I don't even know
why I believe her lying ass.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.365
Because she's your mom.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.367
Or maybe it's because

10:01.368 --> 10:03.369
she never wanted you to begin with.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.504
- What?
- Sit down, Dee!

10:05.505 --> 10:07.840
Dee. Now.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.109
Now.

10:10.576 --> 10:12.800
Switch places with her. Go on.

10:18.268 --> 10:20.068
All right, let's try this again.

10:20.070 --> 10:22.184
_

10:22.186 --> 10:23.923
Anyone else want to share?

10:25.058 --> 10:26.725
What about Superstar?

10:26.726 --> 10:29.428
You don't never talk.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.897
Simone can speak whenever she's ready.

10:31.898 --> 10:35.501
Nah, Superstar ain't got no problems.

10:35.503 --> 10:37.661
Except for all that cracne.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.746
And-and she got
a white sister named Star.

10:40.748 --> 10:42.448
"Star"?

10:42.449 --> 10:44.284
Yo, Dee, chill, yo.

10:44.285 --> 10:45.652
- What?
- Chill out.

10:45.653 --> 10:47.620
Oh, what? What, that's your girl now?

10:47.621 --> 10:50.056
- No, I'm just saying, like...
- What? What is you saying?

10:50.057 --> 10:52.325
You're doing a lot right now,
and it's not necessary.

10:52.326 --> 10:54.260
No, what's not necessary
is you calling me out.

10:54.261 --> 10:55.795
- Dee, why would I call you out?
- Dee. Dee!

10:55.796 --> 10:57.497
- What you saying?
- I don't know. You're switching up on me.

10:57.498 --> 11:00.099
- I'm not switching sides.
- Nah, bitch. St-Stand up, ho.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.935
Code green to multipurpose!

11:01.936 --> 11:03.603
Code green to multipurpose, now!

11:03.604 --> 11:05.071
- What's really...
- Now! Code green!

11:05.072 --> 11:06.406
That's what I want to do, bitch!

11:06.407 --> 11:07.840
Who you loyal to?!

11:07.841 --> 11:11.497
- Get the hell off me, Dee!
- I thought you had my back!

11:12.212 --> 11:13.346
Hey, hey, hey!

11:13.347 --> 11:15.081
Get off her! Get off her!

11:15.082 --> 11:16.716
Come on, get off her!

11:16.717 --> 11:19.385
Get off! Get her out of here!

11:19.386 --> 11:20.939
Just get out. Now.

11:31.295 --> 11:33.342
Thanks, for standing up for me.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.878
- What?
- I know you and Dee are friends.

11:34.879 --> 11:37.313
I'm just saying, it was
real nice, what you did.

11:37.314 --> 11:39.816
That's my friend, a'ight?

11:39.817 --> 11:42.906
I just didn't feel like
seeing your punk ass cry.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.524
Get out of here
with your perfect-ass life.

11:53.801 --> 11:55.802
You nervous? You look nervous.

11:55.803 --> 11:57.370
Yes, I would like to see.

11:59.273 --> 12:00.473
It's cute.

12:00.474 --> 12:02.740
Oh, my God.

12:03.464 --> 12:05.392
I mean, how many more
of these can you make?

12:05.394 --> 12:08.615
Mm-hmm. Told ya. Now you're
about to drag that record lady

12:08.616 --> 12:10.650
to the floor with this one.

12:10.651 --> 12:13.253
And what you got to say?

12:13.254 --> 12:15.623
I look different.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.292
But I ain't no different.

12:19.293 --> 12:21.528
Carlotta might know labels,
but I know how to get attention.

12:21.529 --> 12:24.798
That's what we're about
to do with these.

12:24.799 --> 12:27.600
Well, I'm about to go show Derek.

12:27.601 --> 12:29.302
- Thanks, Miss Bruce.
- Mm-hmm.

12:29.303 --> 12:30.770
The hell you do with this?

12:30.771 --> 12:33.973
- Girl, wrap it, honey.
- It's so flat.

12:33.974 --> 12:36.276
Wrap it that way, fool.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.311
Hey.

12:38.312 --> 12:40.647
Hey. Come look at this.

12:40.648 --> 12:42.449
A man goes to work

12:42.450 --> 12:45.852
and finds a noose resting on his desk.

12:45.853 --> 12:48.689
Like, people don't even
want to be subtle no more.

12:51.692 --> 12:53.493
Wow.

12:53.494 --> 12:56.162
You look sexy.

12:56.163 --> 12:57.363
You cut your hair.

12:57.364 --> 12:59.098
No, I didn't.

12:59.099 --> 13:01.501
It's a wig.

13:01.502 --> 13:04.504
I just wanted to try
something different, and...

13:04.505 --> 13:08.508
that new head at
the label went in on my music.

13:08.509 --> 13:11.611
She said it was ordinary.

13:13.447 --> 13:15.615
Sounded just like my dad.

13:15.616 --> 13:16.850
Oh.

13:16.851 --> 13:18.819
Come here.

13:21.765 --> 13:24.491
One thing you're not...

13:24.492 --> 13:26.493
is ordinary.

13:27.353 --> 13:31.531
- Let-let me touch... this.
- No. No. Do not... touch my hair.

13:35.636 --> 13:36.970
All right, we got to move, like, now.

13:36.971 --> 13:38.471
- What's the hold up?
- I'm sorry.

13:38.472 --> 13:41.275
- Uh, Simone. Hurry up.
- Simone.

13:44.194 --> 13:46.646
Is this shirt too tight?
Does my stomach look okay?

13:46.647 --> 13:48.014
Girl, you're serving.

13:48.015 --> 13:50.484
Come on, you got it. Trust me.

13:53.787 --> 13:55.389
Lord, bless her heart.

13:56.595 --> 13:58.124
- You look cute.
- You three up front.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.659
Dancers in the back.
I'll be moving this camera.

13:59.660 --> 14:01.427
- You look right at me.
- Okay, are you gonna be able to

14:01.428 --> 14:03.663
get it all shot and edited
today? That's all we care about.

14:03.664 --> 14:05.918
In enough time for me to take
your fine ass out tonight.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.309
Yeah. We'll talk about
it if you get it done.

14:08.311 --> 14:11.504
For real? All right, people, we're
burning daylight. Let's go!

14:11.505 --> 14:13.973
Gross, bitch.

16:37.284 --> 16:39.085
She actually is rich.

16:39.086 --> 16:41.354
- Okay, so...
- Well, what you think?

16:41.355 --> 16:43.690
So you gonna post it
on your website or not?

16:43.691 --> 16:45.658
Can't you post it yourself?

16:45.659 --> 16:47.126
Why do you think we brought you here?

16:47.127 --> 16:48.661
What, we have to kiss her ass, too?

16:48.662 --> 16:50.163
- Look, Rachel.
- This is so stupid.

16:50.164 --> 16:52.165
You know nothing in Atlanta gets buzz

16:52.166 --> 16:53.666
without its biggest social media queen,

16:53.667 --> 16:56.269
- which is you.
- I try.

16:56.270 --> 16:58.771
So you gonna post it on your site?

17:00.240 --> 17:02.308
Tell you what.

17:02.309 --> 17:04.810
Kiss from little mama
and you got yourself a deal.

17:04.811 --> 17:06.814
- I'm sorry. A kiss?
- Who...?

17:07.748 --> 17:09.147
I didn't stutter.

17:09.148 --> 17:11.317
That's all you want?
You just want a kiss

17:11.318 --> 17:13.224
and you'll post the video?

17:14.487 --> 17:16.089
Okay. Come here.

17:16.089 --> 17:18.003
Not you.

17:19.666 --> 17:20.752
Her.

17:22.262 --> 17:24.097
Me?

17:25.306 --> 17:26.603
Simone.

17:39.232 --> 17:41.314
Congratulations, ladies.

17:41.315 --> 17:43.249
Y'all are about to break the Internet.

17:43.250 --> 17:46.419
Oh!

17:59.750 --> 18:02.087
This is good. You make it?

18:02.995 --> 18:04.934
Yeah. I've been working
on it for a while.

18:04.936 --> 18:07.492
No, I'm talking about
the rice and beans.

18:07.493 --> 18:09.661
But the beats are dope, too.

18:11.496 --> 18:14.266
Trying to be like you, man.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.234
Even though Pop thinks I'm no good.

18:16.235 --> 18:19.736
Well, that's because
he thinks you're like me.

18:19.738 --> 18:22.206
So you gonna tell me
what's up with you or what?

18:22.207 --> 18:24.242
- Why'd you leave Atlanta?
- Oh, come on, nephew.

18:24.243 --> 18:26.144
Things happen, man.

18:26.145 --> 18:29.080
It's all good now, though.

18:29.081 --> 18:30.915
Come on, man.

18:30.916 --> 18:34.085
TÃ­o... you don't got to lie to me.

18:36.498 --> 18:38.156
All right.

18:38.157 --> 18:40.892
I got into some trouble in Atlanta.

18:40.893 --> 18:43.427
I left town because I thought
I was gonna be framed up

18:43.428 --> 18:46.464
for a couple of murders, but...

18:46.465 --> 18:48.332
the cops made an arrest.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.101
So you're clear to go back.

18:50.102 --> 18:52.503
I'm clear with the cops, but...

18:52.504 --> 18:54.839
I double-crossed the devil's wife.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.008
That's why I'm here.
I came to get my money,

18:57.009 --> 19:00.545
see if I could try to...
convince her to squash our beef.

19:00.546 --> 19:03.014
I guess I got to figure
something else out now.

19:03.015 --> 19:04.549
Take me with you.

19:04.550 --> 19:06.551
Come on, man.

19:06.552 --> 19:08.252
I'm trying to get my music
out in the A, anyway.

19:08.253 --> 19:09.253
- It's a perfect...
- Hey, hey.

19:09.254 --> 19:11.623
Atlanta ain't no place for you.

19:13.876 --> 19:15.427
Play me that beat again.

19:15.429 --> 19:18.092
And make me a copy so I can
take it on the road with me.

19:18.094 --> 19:20.131
All right?

19:20.132 --> 19:22.134
Yeah, I got you.

19:27.263 --> 19:28.740
Good.

19:32.945 --> 19:35.146
- How much longer?
- Um...

19:35.147 --> 19:37.148
She's still in a meeting.

19:37.149 --> 19:38.750
That's what you told me a hour ago.

19:43.922 --> 19:46.123
- Yeah.
- Carlotta.

19:46.124 --> 19:48.125
This new stylist done left
relaxer on too long.

19:48.126 --> 19:50.261
- You got to get down here.
- I can't right now, Bruce.

19:50.262 --> 19:53.064
I'm still at the label trying
to fix things with these girls.

19:53.065 --> 19:54.832
Eh, you talking about
some girl... Carlotta.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.500
Seriously, I'm two seconds
from pulling my switchblade

19:56.501 --> 19:58.736
out on this ho.
You need to get down here.

19:58.737 --> 20:00.338
Bruce, handle it.

20:00.339 --> 20:02.940
Okay, when this ho sue your ass
from here to kingdom come,

20:02.941 --> 20:06.444
- I'm not going to court with you.
- All right, fine. I'm on my way.

20:06.445 --> 20:08.112
Damn.

20:08.113 --> 20:09.981
I know you've been a loyal customer.

20:09.982 --> 20:11.749
And I tell you what, here you go.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.584
Six free visits.

20:13.585 --> 20:15.353
Will that work for you?

20:15.354 --> 20:17.922
Okay.

20:17.923 --> 20:19.257
All the best.

20:19.258 --> 20:21.993
Thank you, Grace. You take good care.

20:21.994 --> 20:23.928
I hope this wedding works.

20:23.929 --> 20:26.865
Three is the charm, Grace.

20:28.997 --> 20:31.602
- Six free visits?
- Mama, we can't afford that.

20:31.603 --> 20:34.205
Don't y'all know Grace is
crazy enough to actually sue us?

20:34.206 --> 20:36.007
I ain't got time to be
caught up with that.

20:36.008 --> 20:37.675
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on with these girls

20:37.676 --> 20:41.139
and these label changes.
I mean, we need to keep up...

20:41.980 --> 20:43.281
Where y'all been?

20:43.282 --> 20:46.050
We shot a music video
and had Rachel Wells upload it.

20:46.051 --> 20:48.119
Why would you pull a stunt like that?

20:48.120 --> 20:50.354
You know Ayanna already
don't like y'all.

20:50.355 --> 20:53.557
I just dodged one lawsuit, they
walk me right into another one.

20:53.558 --> 20:56.260
You know she'll sue us
for everything we got, right?

20:56.261 --> 20:57.897
- Ain't much.
- Okay.

20:57.899 --> 21:00.798
Yeah, we need to hear her out.
You make a point.

21:00.799 --> 21:04.443
Yo, let her come for us. Who cares?
At least she's paying attention to us.

21:04.445 --> 21:06.070
What's wrong with you, Star?

21:06.071 --> 21:08.906
Why wouldn't you run this past me first?

21:08.907 --> 21:10.574
- Take the video down.
- No.

21:10.575 --> 21:12.944
We're not taking the video down
till we know she's seen it.

21:12.945 --> 21:15.279
No, that's what
you don't want, is for her

21:15.280 --> 21:17.448
to see the video. Take it down.

21:17.449 --> 21:19.951
We fought our way into that label,

21:19.952 --> 21:22.253
so we're gonna have to keep fighting.

21:22.254 --> 21:23.955
If Jahil was here right now,

21:23.956 --> 21:26.991
he'd be in Ayanna's face, not mine.

21:27.613 --> 21:28.993
You're really trying me right now.

21:28.994 --> 21:31.461
I'm not. No, I'm not
trying you, Carlotta.

21:31.463 --> 21:34.498
I'm doing what I got to do, like always.

21:35.268 --> 21:37.802
Got to say, you are persistent.

21:38.404 --> 21:40.505
Because I want you on my label.

21:42.507 --> 21:44.709
And what other label
is going to sign you

21:44.710 --> 21:46.978
after you were arrested
for beating up the exec

21:46.979 --> 21:48.479
at your last one?

21:48.480 --> 21:50.047
Man, that dude tried it.

21:50.048 --> 21:51.882
People get shot for way less.

21:51.883 --> 21:54.151
We can argue the First Amendment later.

21:54.152 --> 21:58.012
You are a hothead
and you run with a hothead crew.

21:58.294 --> 22:00.091
Now your friends may think
you're still it,

22:00.092 --> 22:02.960
but no other label's
gonna sign you but mine.

22:02.961 --> 22:06.330
We're in talks with Empire right now.

22:06.331 --> 22:08.799
I talked to Cookie. That's a lie.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.668
Now we can sit here
and admire the high life

22:10.669 --> 22:13.270
you're representing on the Gram, or...

22:13.271 --> 22:16.121
we can admit
that you're not making enough.

22:16.123 --> 22:19.110
Midtown is your last stop.

22:20.281 --> 22:21.946
So what's the deal?

22:25.117 --> 22:27.118
Mmm.

22:27.543 --> 22:29.645
Are you still nursing that?

22:30.546 --> 22:33.214
I'm having a very splashy
showcase in three months.

22:33.215 --> 22:35.016
Leading up to that,

22:35.017 --> 22:37.251
I'm going to have
a very public competition

22:37.252 --> 22:39.954
amongst the label's best artists.

22:39.955 --> 22:43.392
Five of those will be picked
for the spotlight.

22:43.394 --> 22:46.761
But only one will be able
to drop an album.

22:46.762 --> 22:49.597
So, what's that got to do with me?

22:50.539 --> 22:52.133
Crickety-ass door.

22:52.134 --> 22:54.435
How you gonna only put out one album?

22:54.436 --> 22:56.804
That don't even make any sense.

22:56.805 --> 22:58.739
Your assistant let me in,
by the way. He's mad cool.

22:58.740 --> 23:01.281
You changed your hair.
It's a good look on you.

23:01.283 --> 23:02.295
Thank you.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.545
I was just telling Noah that I'm looking

23:04.546 --> 23:07.599
for one new artist who is
going to let the industry know

23:07.601 --> 23:09.402
that Midtown Sound is back.

23:09.403 --> 23:11.838
If you want to bring your label
back, maybe you should go online

23:11.839 --> 23:13.506
and check out the video we put up.

23:13.507 --> 23:15.842
I did. I took it down.

23:15.843 --> 23:17.744
You are artists on my label.

23:17.745 --> 23:20.146
When you go releasing
what is the equivalent

23:20.147 --> 23:23.516
of video mix tapes,
it bifurcates the focus

23:23.517 --> 23:25.451
- from Midtown.
- I'm sorry. I only understood, like,

23:25.452 --> 23:27.153
three of the words you just said.

23:27.154 --> 23:28.154
All right, sweetie,

23:28.155 --> 23:29.756
- well, then let me educate you.
- Please.

23:29.757 --> 23:31.758
The industry has a long history

23:31.759 --> 23:34.320
of artists trying to usurp their label.

23:34.805 --> 23:36.663
You'll always end up on the short end.

23:37.706 --> 23:38.736
Okay.

23:38.738 --> 23:42.170
So your plan is to have all the artists

23:42.172 --> 23:44.940
participate in a musical Hunger Games?

23:44.941 --> 23:47.910
It's not what I want.
It's what the public wants.

23:47.911 --> 23:50.112
Makes them feel that
they're a part of Midtown.

23:50.113 --> 23:52.248
Your group released property

23:52.249 --> 23:54.250
of this label
without my written consent.

23:54.251 --> 23:55.918
As a result,

23:55.919 --> 23:58.554
you won't be competing
for a spot in the showcase.

23:58.555 --> 24:00.756
Okay.

24:00.757 --> 24:03.260
So where does that put me and my group?

24:04.861 --> 24:07.062
You're parked.

24:07.063 --> 24:08.731
Indefinitely.

24:09.328 --> 24:11.570
Welcome to the Hunger Games, baby.

24:14.482 --> 24:17.320
So we're stalled
until our contract expires?

24:17.322 --> 24:21.558
I thought Atlanta NextFest would
have us leap-frog all this crap.

24:21.884 --> 24:23.437
I think the video might have backfired.

24:23.438 --> 24:24.838
Backfired?

24:25.067 --> 24:26.789
We got bitch-slapped to square one.

24:26.790 --> 24:28.824
I wouldn't disagree with that,

24:28.825 --> 24:31.827
but if you were there,
you would've seen it.

24:31.828 --> 24:34.363
There's something in her eyes
that said she really loves us.

24:34.364 --> 24:36.232
Yeah, and so did the other 10.000 people

24:36.233 --> 24:38.801
that viewed that video
before she took it down.

24:38.802 --> 24:41.046
That doesn't mean
we have an album release date.

24:41.048 --> 24:42.107
But it does.

24:42.109 --> 24:43.817
Star, make sense.

24:43.818 --> 24:45.652
We got under her skin.

24:45.653 --> 24:47.220
That's all that matters.

24:47.221 --> 24:50.156
She can deny anything she wants,
but she cannot deny talent.

24:50.157 --> 24:53.093
And we have it, she knows it,
and she can't control it.

24:53.094 --> 24:55.161
That freaks her out.
She's gonna put all of the money

24:55.162 --> 24:57.831
from the label behind one album,
and it's going to be ours.

24:57.832 --> 25:01.835
Look, if she doesn't drop us,
she's gonna ride out the terms.

25:01.836 --> 25:04.504
- And then do what?
- Whatever the hell she wants.

25:04.505 --> 25:08.008
Like, she can have us
doing scratch tracks, backup.

25:08.009 --> 25:09.376
Do you want to do backup?

25:09.377 --> 25:10.644
So we keep grinding. That's what we do.

25:10.645 --> 25:12.612
We've been on the grind,

25:12.613 --> 25:13.680
and where has that gotten us?

25:13.681 --> 25:15.615
'Cause we still don't have a drop date.

25:15.616 --> 25:19.486
Every time we take one step
forward, we take 30 steps back.

25:19.487 --> 25:20.820
Yeah, and we keep trying

25:20.821 --> 25:23.187
to prove ourselves over
and over and over again, Star!

25:23.189 --> 25:25.625
This is the hustle that we chose!

25:25.626 --> 25:29.029
We could be doing a lot worse.

25:29.030 --> 25:32.065
Yo, we are in this.
I'm not about to tap out.

25:32.946 --> 25:35.502
Fine, okay. Then we need to
talk to Miss Carlotta and come up

25:35.503 --> 25:38.339
with some sort of game plan
to fix all this mess.

25:41.312 --> 25:42.668
I'm-a just say it.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.344
Maybe Carlotta's part of it.

25:44.345 --> 25:46.347
A part of what?

25:48.082 --> 25:51.751
Maybe she's not the one
to get us all the way there.

25:51.752 --> 25:54.966
I love Miss Carlotta.
We all do. She's family.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.489
But for this group,

25:56.490 --> 25:58.658
for what we want
and what we need right now,

25:58.659 --> 26:02.262
maybe we got to have somebody
with the same hustle we got,

26:02.263 --> 26:04.698
who thinks outside the box.

26:04.699 --> 26:07.434
She might be too old school.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.502
We're not firing Carlotta.

26:10.126 --> 26:11.438
Period.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.139
Miss Carlotta's family.

26:13.140 --> 26:15.675
We got to do whatever it takes, right?

26:15.676 --> 26:17.511
You're ruthless.

26:34.161 --> 26:37.397
I done told you to keep
your drugs out of my house.

26:37.398 --> 26:39.866
I'm out of the house, am I not?

26:39.867 --> 26:41.368
And the Molly?

26:41.369 --> 26:42.702
Who Molly?

26:42.703 --> 26:44.471
I don't know no Molly.

26:44.472 --> 26:47.307
But I did hear you were
dealing with a real Becky.

26:47.308 --> 26:49.342
- Ayanna Floyd?
- Ugh.

26:49.343 --> 26:52.479
I'm ready to go up in her mouth.
She getting on my nerves.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.647
And the girls think
they know better than me.

26:54.648 --> 26:56.607
You juggling too much.

26:56.907 --> 26:59.746
You need to focus on the girls
and the girls alone.

26:59.748 --> 27:03.656
- Let me handle the salon.
- You might be right.

27:03.657 --> 27:05.358
You up to it?

27:05.359 --> 27:07.260
Up to it?

27:07.261 --> 27:10.497
I'll add some Caucasians
and Asians in this equation.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.866
That's where your real coin
gonna come from.

27:12.867 --> 27:15.377
See, don't get ahead of yourself.

27:15.695 --> 27:16.970
Is that a yes?

27:16.971 --> 27:18.505
That's a "run things by me first

27:18.506 --> 27:21.864
before you turn my salon
into bougie central."

27:22.402 --> 27:24.752
Mm-mm. Bad and bougie central.

27:46.819 --> 27:48.643
Hi. Yeah, it's Alexandra Crane.

27:48.645 --> 27:51.705
I know you're closing,
but can you keep the store open?

27:51.706 --> 27:54.508
Of course, Miss Crane.
You're a VIP customer.

27:54.509 --> 27:55.876
Okay, great.

27:55.877 --> 27:58.179
Yeah, I'll be there in ten minutes.

27:58.180 --> 27:59.681
Bye.

28:38.037 --> 28:40.188
- The hell?
- Welcome back to Atlanta.

28:44.688 --> 28:46.623
Hey.

28:47.324 --> 28:51.481
Look, I know you may think
you're alone, but you're not.

28:51.482 --> 28:53.016
You know, whatever we got to deal with

28:53.017 --> 28:56.120
with Ayanna and Midtown,
we gonna do it together.

28:58.019 --> 29:00.758
Something else going on? What's up?

29:04.725 --> 29:07.090
Me and the girls been talking.

29:07.849 --> 29:09.666
We feel like our music is kind of in

29:09.667 --> 29:12.369
this crossroads spot
where it's either gonna pop off

29:12.370 --> 29:14.971
- or flatline.
- Say what's on your mind, Star.

29:14.972 --> 29:16.941
So we were thinking... I was thinking...

29:20.054 --> 29:21.545
we might need a change.

29:21.546 --> 29:23.381
What kind of change?

29:25.483 --> 29:28.353
Like... management.

29:38.296 --> 29:39.730
You gonna say something?

29:39.731 --> 29:41.498
Nah, I'm straight.

29:41.499 --> 29:44.000
You just keep talking.

29:44.001 --> 29:46.072
Carlotta, this is not easy for me.

29:46.074 --> 29:49.172
No? What's hard for you, Star?

29:49.173 --> 29:51.375
Is it hard for you 'cause maybe
you're feeling some type of way

29:51.376 --> 29:52.909
'cause you know it's wrong?

29:52.910 --> 29:54.926
And who's supposed
to manage the group? You?

29:54.928 --> 29:57.314
- Listen, if I could...
- Just, no, no, no, you listen.

29:57.315 --> 30:00.717
You think going it alone
in the world makes you unique.

30:01.228 --> 30:02.886
It don't.

30:02.887 --> 30:04.855
You sleep with
the president of the label.

30:04.856 --> 30:07.758
Then you drop a video
without talking to me first,

30:07.759 --> 30:09.893
and who's there to clean up your mess?

30:10.407 --> 30:12.084
Me.

30:12.931 --> 30:14.996
So, this how you want to play this?

30:16.401 --> 30:18.798
'Cause I'm not the problem here, Star.

30:19.178 --> 30:20.505
You are.

30:22.273 --> 30:24.509
You create your own drama.

30:29.576 --> 30:32.282
You not unique.

30:32.283 --> 30:34.352
You selfish.

30:53.612 --> 30:56.040
Miss Crane? Miss Crane.

30:59.010 --> 31:00.577
Thanks for keeping
the store open for me.

31:00.578 --> 31:03.313
It's a rule for all
VIP customers, Miss Crane.

31:03.314 --> 31:05.715
Thank you.

31:54.332 --> 31:56.501
Come help, please!

31:57.969 --> 32:00.071
Somebody, please!

32:02.173 --> 32:04.041
Oh, my God.

32:06.043 --> 32:08.546
Oh, my God. Somebody, please.

32:45.207 --> 32:46.743
Hello.

32:46.745 --> 32:49.580
So do I get my own parking spot?

32:49.581 --> 32:52.917
We can talk about that on Monday.

32:52.918 --> 32:55.319
9:00 a.m.?

32:58.123 --> 33:00.491
But this is just business.

33:02.461 --> 33:05.363
Okay, okay, okay. Stop complaining now.

33:05.364 --> 33:07.832
Maggie could've had you killed.

33:08.717 --> 33:11.908
She knew that dropping
the dime on Leonard

33:11.909 --> 33:15.144
for killing Hunter and Eva
would probably smoke my ass out.

33:15.145 --> 33:18.312
She never got over me
letting those girls free from that man.

33:18.314 --> 33:20.986
I-I'm sorry.

33:20.987 --> 33:24.156
But I didn't have no money for her.

33:24.157 --> 33:26.992
I paid her with the only thing I had.

33:26.993 --> 33:29.528
I think what happened
with Hunter and Eva

33:29.529 --> 33:31.798
is enough punishment.

33:36.791 --> 33:40.072
Maggie's never gonna know
that you helped me, Lottie.

33:40.073 --> 33:41.975
Never.

33:45.575 --> 33:48.247
- Is there enough blood?
- Yeah, it's enough blood.

33:48.248 --> 33:50.416
I can't believe you got me in this mess.

33:50.417 --> 33:52.819
When I said good-bye
to you that night...

33:54.609 --> 33:57.423
I thought I was never
gonna see you again.

33:57.424 --> 33:59.825
- You okay?
- Yeah.

33:59.826 --> 34:01.326
Take off the gloves.

34:03.196 --> 34:05.597
Take care of it, all right?

34:05.598 --> 34:08.434
- Keys.
- No, no, no.

34:08.435 --> 34:10.702
Give it to her.

34:10.703 --> 34:12.371
- Cotton?
- Yeah.

34:13.973 --> 34:18.710
- Where you going?
- Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

34:18.710 --> 34:21.013
But somewhere far from here.

34:24.350 --> 34:26.565
You ain't coming back, are you?

34:27.368 --> 34:28.821
Not if I want to stay alive.

34:31.621 --> 34:33.125
I got to clean up.

34:33.126 --> 34:34.726
You know, Lottie...

34:37.464 --> 34:41.065
if you didn't come tonight, if you,
if you didn't know what to do...

34:48.989 --> 34:50.444
Thank you.

35:07.695 --> 35:08.794
I got to go.

35:25.144 --> 35:28.013
- What's up with the girls?
- They dumped me.

35:28.014 --> 35:31.683
Oh, that Star ain't never gonna change.
I'll tell you that right now.

35:31.684 --> 35:33.452
And I ain't have no paperwork on them.

35:33.453 --> 35:34.987
I thought my word was cool.

35:34.988 --> 35:36.688
Maybe I've been out of the game too long

35:36.689 --> 35:38.724
to know what the hell the new rules are.

35:38.725 --> 35:41.827
This is the music business;
there ain't no damn rules.

35:41.828 --> 35:44.963
If that's what you're looking
for, go make your own.

35:44.964 --> 35:48.834
This new label president,
she's trying to push them aside.

35:48.835 --> 35:51.404
I argue with her,
but she ain't trying to hear me.

35:51.406 --> 35:53.672
Stop arguing, just...

35:54.245 --> 35:56.486
give her something that she needs.

35:57.277 --> 35:59.478
Yo.

35:59.479 --> 36:02.915
You show up on my doorstep
half dead giving me advice.

36:02.916 --> 36:05.183
Hey, I could show up at
your doorstep all the way dead,

36:05.184 --> 36:06.818
I'd still try to give you advice.

36:06.819 --> 36:08.287
No, I don't play that ghost stuff.

36:08.288 --> 36:10.956
You ain't gonna have
my hands in no clay.

36:10.957 --> 36:12.591
You ain't no Patrick Swayze.

36:14.360 --> 36:16.862
- Ow, ow.
- Careful, careful.

36:16.863 --> 36:17.963
Hey.

36:17.964 --> 36:20.766
Can you, uh, put that
on loop right quick?

36:20.767 --> 36:22.768
- Copy that.
- Get some of these lines.

36:27.674 --> 36:29.675
- That good?
- Yeah, that's good.

36:29.676 --> 36:32.644
Yo. Looks like you decided
to sign. Congrats.

36:32.645 --> 36:34.212
I need the booth. Can you get out?

36:34.213 --> 36:36.548
What are you doing?

36:36.549 --> 36:38.684
Oh, does this, does this
talk-back button not work?

36:38.685 --> 36:40.185
Does this talk-back button not work?!

36:40.186 --> 36:41.853
Get out the booth! I need it!

36:41.854 --> 36:43.055
- Look.
- Now!

36:43.056 --> 36:44.656
Can you turn the music up, please?

36:44.657 --> 36:46.058
- Thank you.
- Do not...

36:46.059 --> 36:48.660
- Copy that.
- You know what?

36:48.661 --> 36:50.796
Say I won't!

36:50.797 --> 36:52.798
- This bitch is crazy. I'm out of here.
- Hold on.

36:52.799 --> 36:54.900
- Get out the booth!
- Okay, okay, okay.

36:54.901 --> 36:57.135
Sh...

36:58.137 --> 36:59.671
All right.

36:59.672 --> 37:01.807
Come on, let's go.
Let's get out of here.

37:03.576 --> 37:04.910
Where are you going?

37:04.911 --> 37:06.445
Home.

37:06.446 --> 37:09.147
What am I supposed to do, record
myself running back and forth?

37:09.148 --> 37:11.650
Figure it out. It's track number three.

37:12.434 --> 37:14.984
And FYI, all these buttons work.

37:21.294 --> 37:23.996
Another glass of champagne?

37:23.997 --> 37:26.198
Only if you join me.

37:27.533 --> 37:29.001
Come on.

37:29.002 --> 37:30.972
Aren't you basically off anyway?

37:30.974 --> 37:32.705
You've got a point.

37:39.445 --> 37:41.881
- To a great night of shopping.
- Yes.

37:44.459 --> 37:46.332
Let me get these wrapped up
and get you out of here.

37:46.334 --> 37:47.682
Okay.

37:50.723 --> 37:53.092
What did I do with that bracelet?

37:56.062 --> 37:57.764
Is everything okay?

37:59.632 --> 38:02.000
Nothing. It must be on the other tray.

38:02.001 --> 38:04.003
Probably the bubbly.

38:17.791 --> 38:19.651
Really?

38:19.652 --> 38:21.654
Andy, you're fired!

38:23.823 --> 38:25.624
You're cute.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.993
Oh, and, technically,
HR would have to fire me,

38:27.994 --> 38:29.461
and they're closed right now.

38:29.462 --> 38:31.630
And besides, they love me.

38:31.631 --> 38:34.633
So, thanks again. See you tomorrow.

38:34.634 --> 38:38.171
Oh. And, uh, Carlotta Brown's
here to see you.

38:41.673 --> 38:44.509
I assume you heard
your girls have been parked

38:44.510 --> 38:46.736
since they released their video.

38:48.614 --> 38:50.649
I did my homework on you.

38:50.650 --> 38:52.651
You the black sheep of the family.

38:52.652 --> 38:54.219
This is your last stop.

38:54.220 --> 38:56.755
And if this doesn't work,
what you got left?

38:56.756 --> 38:59.591
Small trust fund
and a mean shoe collection?

39:00.201 --> 39:02.461
Do I need to call security?

39:02.462 --> 39:04.287
I am security.

39:05.028 --> 39:06.431
I'm security for those girls.

39:06.432 --> 39:08.600
And if you take your head
out your ass for a minute,

39:08.601 --> 39:10.402
you'll see that I'm security
for you, too.

39:11.965 --> 39:16.174
You want to prove you belong at the
head of the Floyd family table?

39:16.175 --> 39:18.643
Put my girls back in the showcase.

39:18.644 --> 39:21.847
Be the first to break a hot girl group.

39:21.848 --> 39:24.449
Don't let God-given talent pass you by

39:24.450 --> 39:28.653
just 'cause you got your perfect
surgically-enhanced nose bent.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.177
It was a bad doctor.

39:35.094 --> 39:37.529
Put the music video back up.

39:37.530 --> 39:40.832
If we don't get 100.000 views
in five days,

39:41.281 --> 39:43.635
then we walk, empty-handed.

39:43.636 --> 39:47.473
But if we do,
you put us back in the mix.

39:53.679 --> 39:57.616
- We're not firing Carlotta.
- You're ruthless.

39:57.617 --> 40:00.529
You won't be competing for
a spot in the showcase.

40:01.120 --> 40:03.622
You not unique. You selfish.

40:04.775 --> 40:06.792
- Move.
- Will you leave me alone?

40:06.793 --> 40:08.393
Look, I'm trying to help you.

40:08.394 --> 40:11.328
Whatever you got inside you
right now, let's put it down.

40:11.330 --> 40:12.689
Don't lose it.

40:13.263 --> 40:15.567
- I got you.
- What, you gonna record my vocals?

40:15.568 --> 40:18.258
Yes, I'm gonna record your vocals.

40:18.260 --> 40:20.873
Come on. Get in there. Star.

40:24.489 --> 40:26.598
You're a weird-ass dude.

40:33.699 --> 40:34.934
What track is it?

40:35.278 --> 40:37.034
Three.

40:43.029 --> 40:44.729
I'm ready when you are.

40:46.001 --> 40:47.642
Give me a minute.

40:49.602 --> 40:51.269
Can we cut the lights down or something?

40:51.270 --> 40:53.273
It's super bright.
