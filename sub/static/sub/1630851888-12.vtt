37:06.800 --> 37:08.283

37:08.301 --> 37:10.227

37:10.378 --> 37:12.287
When he, you know,
has a moment,

37:12.305 --> 37:14.564
Like, he may not wanna talk,

37:14.716 --> 37:18.626
Like, to give him that grace
and let him know that,

37:18.645 --> 37:20.219
"hey, I do wanna talk about it,
though, whenever you're ready."

37:20.313 --> 37:21.296
You know?
- Okay.

37:21.314 --> 37:23.573
- And not to, like, push.

37:23.725 --> 37:25.316
And he does,
and he'll come back around

37:25.410 --> 37:27.226
And he'll tell me what it was,
and it's like, "okay."

37:27.246 --> 37:29.153
- And so you're learning
to reciprocate that

37:29.248 --> 37:31.081

and that you speak

37:31.308 --> 37:32.898

comfortable enough

And you know I don't eat
that stuff usually.

1:21:07.864 --> 1:21:10.030
When you brought it over,
I eat it because you made it.

1:21:10.182 --> 1:21:14.109
- I don't know you yet, johnny.
I don't know you yet.

1:21:14.261 --> 1:21:18.205
You don't know me yet.

1:21:18.357 --> 1:21:23.193
But I do agree that we seem
to have a misunderstanding

1:21:23.212 --> 1:21:27.289
In reading each other's effort.

1:21:27.383 --> 1:21:31.034
- What's the next step for us?

1:21:31.053 --> 1:21:35.055
- I do think we should
talk more on a daily basis.

1:21:35.207 --> 1:21:38.041
- Can you commit to do
everyday things together?

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:39.785
- Yes.

1:21:39.878 --> 1:21:40.969
I'm gonna try
to wake up earlier

1:21:41.122 --> 1:21:43.564
And have coffee with you.

1:21:43.791 --> 1:21:46.567

figure out a path forward.

[both laughing]

1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:54.876

have a tendency

1:22:57.139 --> 1:22:59.139
To be controlling.

1:22:59.366 --> 1:23:02.625

He can be vindictive.

1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:04.294
- I feel like with her,

1:23:04.313 --> 1:23:06.205
I'm somebody
that I don't want to be.

1:23:06.298 --> 1:23:07.556

That, like,
things have to be perfect,

1:23:18.235 --> 1:23:20.068

1:23:20.221 --> 1:23:21.887
Life is not good enough.

1:23:21.905 --> 1:23:24.331

already been made.

1:23:26.744 --> 1:23:28.227

we could have dated.

1:23:28.245 --> 1:23:29.561
I wasn't attracted to you.
