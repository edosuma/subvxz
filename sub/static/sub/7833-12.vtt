Our first Springfield Pride Award

02:51.971 --> 02:54.769
I mean an award
that's worth winning!

You know, Kent, in today's
youth-obsessed culture...

we sometimes forget that
older people are still alive.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.558
- I told ya!
- Well, sorry!

03:15.795 --> 03:18.093

[ Brittney]
In the market crash of 1929...

03:45.225 --> 03:48.092
he helped people jump out of windows
to avoid disgrace.

better care of myself.

Look how loud I have to yell!

08:34.746 --> 08:39.081
This all seems a little elaborate
for sloppy joes. Hmm.

I know what the other 11 forks are for,
but what do you do with this one?.

08:43.489 --> 08:47.118

you're supposed to scratch your ass with it.

Ohh!

08:50.196 --> 08:52.756
That's a lifesaver.

Man, this is livin'.

[ Groans ] Stop that! Cigars are for rich people
and legendary comedians...

## [ Humming ]
Oops, forgot to swirl it.

09:13.986 --> 09:17.353
Homer, did you jimmy open
Mr. Burns' liquor cabinet?.

09:17.456 --> 09:20.323
"J jimmy" is such
an ugly word, Marge...

09:20.426 --> 09:23.293
unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits.

T-I- and so on.

09:52.525 --> 09:56.621
- Homer, who are you calling?.
- Everybody! I found Burnsie's address book.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.197
I called the New York Yankees
and told them to bunt...

09:59.298 --> 10:02.790
and then I called the queen of England
and asked her how it was  going'.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.166
- And. then I-
- Well, don't run up Mr. Burns' phone bill.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.762
Just a second, Marge.
Hello?. Thailand?.

10:07.873 --> 10:11.331
How's everything on your end?.
Uh-huh.

10:11.444 --> 10:16.609
That's some language you got there.
And you talk like that 24-7, huh?.

10:16.716 --> 10:20.117
- Hey!
- Homer, you've got to stop
pretending this is your house.

10:20.219 --> 10:25.020
- You're not a billionaire.
- Gee. Way to burst my bubble, Marge.

10:25.124 --> 10:29.925
All I'm saying is don't get too comfortable.
Mr. Burns will be back tomorrow.

10:30.029 --> 10:33.226
Marge, you're right.
We do have to have a party!

10:33.332 --> 10:36.699

And I looked so good on that bike.

on this chart.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.516
Fine. We'll just start
by drawing some blood.

10:59.625 --> 11:03.994
Well, isn't that odd?.
It's like poking through meringue.

11:04.096 --> 11:07.327
Oh, try this arm.
I saw some blood in there the other day.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.869

Havin' a party, Moe. I'll need four kegs
of your finest imported-sounding beer.

How about Tuborg,
the beer of Danish kings?.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.066
Mmm. Danish.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.806

Huh?. If you can't sell beer,
what are Lenny and Carl doin' here?.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.818
Huh?. Oh, we're just watching
the sun move across the sky.

12:01.921 --> 12:04.549
When it gets to here,
we can drink again.

12:04.657 --> 12:08.593
- But I need that beer now!
- Sorry, 2:00 p.m.

12:08.694 --> 12:12.186
Or you can steal a boat and sail out
to international waters. Heh!

12:12.298 --> 12:15.290
- What's that, a theme park?.
- No, the ocean.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.961
Once you get 1 2 miles out,
there's no laws at all.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.300
That's where they held
the Tyson/Secretariat fight.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.704
[ Homer] They were so drunk!

12:22.808 --> 12:25.402

Oh, no, you don't! I'm not gonna let you
trash Mr. Burns's  yacht.

12:45.264 --> 12:50.668
Marge, you know I normally listen to you,
but I gotta seize this opportunity...

12:50.770 --> 12:53.534
just in case I never become
a real billionaire.

12:53.639 --> 12:59.509
Oh, Homie. I don't care if youâ€™re a billionaire.
I love you just because you're-

Because, uh, things are gettin' real ugly.

13:34.213 --> 13:37.842
I can't sell you beer
till we cross the line!

13:37.950 --> 13:41.477
Legally, you could
give us free beer.

13:41.587 --> 13:46.115
- Ow!
- Well, could you at least give us
rubbing alcohol for our wounds?.
