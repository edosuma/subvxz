WEBVTT

00:24.225 --> 00:26.358
Wake up. You're
gonna be late.

00:36.337 --> 00:39.405
Wait.
What was my dream again?

00:41.208 --> 00:43.809
I remember feeling trapped
in rising heat

00:43.811 --> 00:48.380
and there were plastic or
cardboard cutouts all around me

00:48.382 --> 00:51.383
and my gums roots were
pushing out my teeth

00:51.385 --> 00:54.586
and the voice of a thousand
angels said to me,

00:54.588 --> 00:56.455
"It's temporary."

00:57.258 --> 01:01.226
Maybe that should be my mantra as
I step into what will inevitably be

01:01.228 --> 01:03.429
the worst years of my life.

01:03.764 --> 01:08.233
Ah yes, off to a world in which
girls are to only wear pink dresses

01:08.235 --> 01:10.135
and boys blue pants.

01:10.137 --> 01:13.772
Well, I dyed my uniform and
embroidered flowers on the sleeves.

01:15.643 --> 01:19.411
Speaking of, I should probably
change into my uniform right now.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.748
Nah, that shit's itchy.
It can wait.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.789
Oh yea, and in my dream,

01:30.791 --> 01:34.493
you know when the air below me was
sucking my teeth out of their sockets,

01:34.495 --> 01:36.829
I noticed that my front
two teeth stayed

01:36.831 --> 01:40.165
and the gap between them just
kept getting larger and larger.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.768
How's that even possible?
I know right?

01:43.637 --> 01:47.406
I wish my Mom wasn't passed out right now and
could at least drive me to the bus stop.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.744
Phillipe? What are
you doing in there?

01:54.682 --> 01:56.415
Don't scare me like that.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.230
What was that angel's
name again?

02:11.866 --> 02:15.400
Was it Willy or Layla?

02:15.402 --> 02:17.336
No, I think it was Lilith.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.689
Feel so sick.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.626
I can't believe
we have to do this.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.230
Do you think we'll
make any friends?

02:45.232 --> 02:48.667
- I hope so, but at least we have each other.
- That's true.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.710
Okay, okay. Stop. Stop.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.920
Seriously?

03:10.257 --> 03:11.890
What does it say?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.362
Real mature.

03:17.364 --> 03:21.300
Aw,
sad wittle baby! Go on!

03:21.302 --> 03:24.436
Does the bunny wabbit
need some tissues?

03:24.438 --> 03:26.672
I bet she has
some in her bra.

03:26.674 --> 03:31.343
It's okay, just ignore them.
Just plastic assholes.

03:31.345 --> 03:35.280

Angelita I need you to

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.735
I caught a sparkle
of light in your eyes that day.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:43.872
I bathed in it,
was transported to heaven's gates by it,

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:48.877
but I fall at my feet. My words
shall only be composed. I can't speak.

- Crybaby?

- Earth to Crybaby. Are you in?
- Yea. Sorry.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.754
Your job is to manipulate
the spawn of Satan himself

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:01.256
into letting you into his office

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:02.991

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:07.095
- I think it's a love letter.
- A love letter form who?

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:09.297
- I don't know. It doesn't say.
- Okay guys,

- Where?

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:10.605

- Yea. Why aren't you up there?

01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:15.009
Okay, so I got asked
to the dance by Leo.

manipulate you?

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:23.150

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:25.253
and trust me, I wanted to.

01:15:25.255 --> 01:15:28.189

to get out of this place for good.

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:29.991

Seriously?

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:42.169
- Look, I don't know, I guess I was just--
- Being selfish.

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.592
Forget it.

01:15:47.593 --> 01:15:49.577
- Wait!
- Nope. It's fine, just let her go. It's fine.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:07.828

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:58.345
- Me too.
- Woah, woah, woah!

01:21:58.347 --> 01:22:01.048
You bitch, let me out.

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:04.485
Hey! Hey!

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:16.163
Woah!

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.366
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:22:19.368 --> 01:22:23.704
Everybody,
evacuate the school immediately. Go, now!

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:28.709
- She's safe.
- Come on, let's go

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:33.714
Move, move! Get out,
get out!

01:22:33.716 --> 01:22:36.517
Hey, let's go! Come on!

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:06.380
Hey! Shit.

01:23:18.127 --> 01:23:22.429
What do I do?
Oh my God. Think. Think.

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:29.570
- Hey! Hi.
- Shit! You have to go downstairs.

01:23:29.572 --> 01:23:32.473
It's alright, I didn't mean to
startle you. I'm here to help.

01:23:32.475 --> 01:23:34.074
Look, I appreciate that
but I really have to--

01:23:34.076 --> 01:23:37.578
I'm Ben. I'm the one who
wrote the love letter.

01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:59.166
Okay. How do we destroy
this place?

01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:04.671
- I don't know what to do. Do you have any ideas?
- Uh.

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:18.118
- Do you know how to blow spit bubbles?
- What?

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.820
What are you talking about?

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:22.356
Why?

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:24.691
We can trap the school.

01:24:24.693 --> 01:24:27.494
- We can lift the school up in a bubble.
- I don't know.

01:24:27.496 --> 01:24:29.563
Okay, let's try it.

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:53.454
- Where's Crybaby?
- I don't know.

01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:56.190
- Have you guys seen Crybaby?
- No.

01:24:56.826 --> 01:24:59.693
That's-- Look.

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:02.196
- Are you ready?
- Yea.

01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:04.331
- I mean no. I haven't really
done this before so I can't--

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:06.233
- Ben. It's our only option.
- Sorry.

01:25:06.235 --> 01:25:07.801
We have to try this, okay?

01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:10.170
Okay. You're right.
You're right.

01:25:33.529 --> 01:25:35.229
Woah.

01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:37.231
Well damn.

01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:42.769
Pinch me I'm dreaming. Ow.

01:25:47.176 --> 01:25:49.510
Holy shit, we don't have much
time until we're too high up.

01:25:49.512 --> 01:25:51.778
We need to jump. Right now.
on the count of three.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.313
If we jump, we'll die.

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:55.249
Fear of death is irrational
right now Ben.

01:25:55.251 --> 01:25:56.783
Either we die in a few minutes,

01:25:56.785 --> 01:25:59.486
or we attempt to live
right now. Okay?

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:12.733
Now.

01:26:15.271 --> 01:26:17.404
Ahhhhh!

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:30.517
Oh, ahh.

That's it.

01:26:53.943 --> 01:26:57.611
- Il y a du sang partout.
- What does that mean?

01:26:57.613 --> 01:27:00.447
There's blood everywhere.
I don't really know French.

01:27:00.449 --> 01:27:02.416
It's just something I
picked up as a kid.

01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:04.384
Had a French nanny.

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:16.730

01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:24.805
