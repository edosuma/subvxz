WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.633
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.633 --> 00:06.037
AT MIKE'S FUNERAL,
SUSAN AND M.J. SAID GOOD-BYE.

00:06.037 --> 00:08.039
GABY GAVE HER BLESSING.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.310
YOU SHOULD QUIT YOUR JOB.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.781
IF BEING A COUNSELOR
IS GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY,

00:10.781 --> 00:13.044
THEN THAT'S WHAT
YOU SHOULD DO.

00:13.044 --> 00:15.586
LYNETTE SPOKE HER MIND
ABOUT TOM'S GIRLFRIEND...

00:15.586 --> 00:18.549
I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IT'S
GONNA LAST THAT MUCH LONGER.

00:18.549 --> 00:20.621
AND THE POLICE GATHERED
MORE EVIDENCE.

00:20.621 --> 00:24.625
SOMEONE IS ACCUSING YOU
OF KILLING MR. SANCHEZ.
 THAT'S JUST SILLY.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.026
I WANNA MAKE SURE
WE GET ENOUGH

00:26.026 --> 00:28.199
TO PUT THIS BITCH AWAY
FOR GOOD.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.605
(Mary Alice) RENEE PERRY
HAD WAITED MANY MONTHS

00:34.605 --> 00:36.737
FOR A PROPOSAL,

00:36.737 --> 00:40.711
AND FOR MANY MONTHS,
SHE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED.

00:40.711 --> 00:45.646
THERE HAD BEEN
COZY EVENING BY THE FIRE...

00:45.646 --> 00:48.579
THAT DIDN'T GO
THE WAY SHE HAD HOPED.

00:50.281 --> 00:54.325
A ROMANTIC MOMENT
IN WISTERIA PARK...

00:54.325 --> 00:56.227
THAT WASN'T SO ROMANTIC

00:56.227 --> 00:59.430
AFTER ALL.

00:59.430 --> 01:03.494
AND A BEAUTIFUL PICNIC
BY A LAKE...

01:03.494 --> 01:05.266
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE

01:05.266 --> 01:07.638
NOTHING MORE THAN A PICNIC.

01:07.638 --> 01:09.840
(blows nose)

01:09.840 --> 01:14.205
SO WHEN DISAPPOINTMENT
STRUCK AGAIN...

01:15.706 --> 01:18.179
RENEE DECIDED TO SPEAK UP.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.480
DESSERT?

01:19.480 --> 01:22.153
THAT'S THE BIG FINALE
TO A 6-COURSE MEAL?

01:22.153 --> 01:23.354
DESSERT?

01:23.354 --> 01:25.316
WERE YOU EXPECTING, LIKE,
A CHEESE COURSE?

01:25.316 --> 01:26.317
NO!

01:26.317 --> 01:28.189
I WAS EXPECTING A RING.

01:28.189 --> 01:31.162
YOU HAVE RED ROSES,
CHAMPAGNE.

01:31.162 --> 01:32.463
YOU ARE SENDING ME
EVERY SIGNAL IN THE WORLD

01:32.463 --> 01:34.395
THAT I'M ABOUT TO GET
A BIG PROPOSAL

01:34.395 --> 01:36.497
AND INSTEAD, I GET A COOKIE.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.868
WELL,
IT'S A CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE.

01:37.868 --> 01:41.202
(scoffs) WHATEVER.
I AM NOT A YOUNG WOMAN.

01:41.202 --> 01:44.205
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE
FAKE OUTS MY HEART CAN TAKE.

01:44.205 --> 01:48.139
OKAY, FINE.
I-I WAS GONNA PROPOSE TONIGHT.

01:48.139 --> 01:50.281
I JUST DID SUCH A HORRIBLE JOB
THE FIRST TIME,

01:50.281 --> 01:52.843
I-I... I WANTED THIS
TO BE EXCEPTIONAL.

01:52.843 --> 01:54.785
THEY CALL IT
"POPPING THE QUESTION,"

01:54.785 --> 01:56.847
NOT "DRAGGING IT OUT
TO ETERNITY,"

01:56.847 --> 01:59.190
SO COME ON! POP!

01:59.190 --> 02:01.222
CAN I AT LEAST, UH, READ YOU
THE SPEECH THAT I WROTE?

02:01.222 --> 02:05.526
OH, LORD. JUST GIVE ME
THE LAST PARAGRAPH.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.231
UH...

02:10.231 --> 02:11.702
OKAY.

02:11.702 --> 02:14.165
"FOR ALL THESE REASONS
AND MORE,

02:14.165 --> 02:16.707
IT IS WITH GREAT HONOR,
THAT I ASK YOU IF YOU"--

02:16.707 --> 02:18.569
(knock on door)

02:18.569 --> 02:20.811
UH, WE'RE IGNORING THAT.
KEEP GOING.

02:20.811 --> 02:22.643
"...I-IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER
MAKING ME

02:22.643 --> 02:24.415
THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE"--

02:24.415 --> 02:26.146
(knock)
 GO AWAY!

02:26.146 --> 02:28.619
(Detective Heredia)
IT'S THE POLICE.

02:28.619 --> 02:32.183
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A MR. BEN FAULKNER.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.661
I'M BEN FAULKNER.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

02:40.661 --> 02:41.862
YOU OWN
THE CONDOMINIUM PROJECT

02:41.862 --> 02:44.164
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
AT CHAPMAN WOODS?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.696
I USED TO. BANK OWNS IT NOW.

02:45.696 --> 02:47.498
YOU MIND COMING DOWN
TO THE STATION WITH US?

02:47.498 --> 02:50.471
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT
A BODY WE FOUND ON THE SITE.

02:50.471 --> 02:53.304
IS... HE UNDER ARREST?

02:53.304 --> 02:56.407
NO, MA'AM. WE JUST WANT TO ASK
YOU BOYFRIEND A FEW QUESTIONS.

02:56.407 --> 02:57.848
(mouths word)

02:57.848 --> 02:59.950
WAIT!

03:02.813 --> 03:04.285
AH.

03:08.959 --> 03:12.192
HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.
HE'S MY FIANCE.

03:12.192 --> 03:17.668
YES, RENEE PERRY HAD WAITED
A LONG TIME FOR A PROPOSAL...

03:17.668 --> 03:19.330
OKAY. NOW YOU CAN TAKE HIM.

03:19.330 --> 03:25.306
AND SHE WASN'T ABOUT TO LET IT
SLIP THROUGH HER FINGERS.

03:38.749 --> 03:41.252
BREE VAN DE KAMP
STARTED EVERY MORNING

03:41.252 --> 03:44.825
BY CATCHING UP
ON THE LATEST NEWS,

03:44.825 --> 03:50.401
BUT SOMETIMES THE NEWS CAME
FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE.

03:50.401 --> 03:53.804
HEY, BREE.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HAND.

03:53.804 --> 03:56.407
OH, MY GOODNESS!

03:56.407 --> 03:57.338
ARE YOU--

03:57.338 --> 03:58.609
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

03:58.609 --> 04:00.411
OH, HOW WONDERFUL!

04:00.411 --> 04:02.713
YEAH, WE'RE PRETTY HAPPY.
 "PRETTY HAPPY"?

04:02.713 --> 04:04.244
OH, WE'RE ECSTATIC.
KNICKERS TO THE WIND.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.946
OVER THE MOON.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.678
CONGRATULATIONS.
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

04:07.678 --> 04:09.380
LAST NIGHT.
OH, AND GET THIS--

04:09.380 --> 04:11.522
IN THE MIDDLE
OF HIS BIG, ROMANTIC PROPOSAL,

04:11.522 --> 04:13.954
THE COPS COME BY TO ASK
ABOUT SOME DEAD BODY

04:13.954 --> 04:15.956
THEY FOUND
AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE.

04:17.827 --> 04:19.490
SO TELL ME MORE.

04:19.490 --> 04:23.334
WELL, I DEFINITELY WANT A BIG
WEDDING. BRIDESMAIDS, THE WORKS.

04:23.334 --> 04:25.496
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BODY.
WHAT DID THE POLICE SAY?

04:25.496 --> 04:27.368
UH, NOT MUCH.
YOU KNOW, I TOLD THEM

04:27.368 --> 04:29.440
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT, AND THEY BELIEVED ME.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.671
GOOD.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.403
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY,

04:32.403 --> 04:34.044
I'M SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME SOONER.

04:34.044 --> 04:35.876
YOU KNOW...
 OH, WE'RE SORRY.
UH, IT WAS LATE,

04:35.876 --> 04:37.878
AND I WANTED
TO TELL MY SISTER FIRST.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.550
AGAIN,
TALKING ABOUT THE BODY.

04:39.550 --> 04:40.881
WHY WOULD WE TELL YOU THAT?

04:40.881 --> 04:43.554
AND WHY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THIS AND NOT ME?

04:43.554 --> 04:46.557
QUITE RIGHT. I-I JUST WOULD HATE
TO SEE THIS TRAGIC NEWS

04:46.557 --> 04:48.489
INTERFERE
WITH YOUR HAPPY DAY.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.321
AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL,

04:50.321 --> 04:51.892
BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT IT.

04:51.892 --> 04:55.326
UH, THE POLICE DON'T SEEM LIKE
THEY'RE GONNA POSE A PROBLEM.

04:57.668 --> 04:58.769
THAT WAS JUDGE KEMP.

04:58.769 --> 05:00.901
HE JUST SIGNED OFF
ON THAT WARRANT.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.073
FOR BREE VAN DE KAMP?

05:03.073 --> 05:04.635
THAT WAS FAST.

05:04.635 --> 05:06.937
I MIGHT'VE CALLED IN
SOME FAVORS.

05:06.937 --> 05:08.839
THE SOONER I CAN PROVE
SHE'S GUILTY,

05:08.839 --> 05:12.413
THE SOONER I CAN WATCH
HER PAY FOR IT.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.516
WE GOT ANOTHER ONE.
UM, MITZI KINSKY.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.849
"MIKE WAS A RAY OF SUNSHINE
ON OUR STREET.

05:18.849 --> 05:20.391
HE WILL BE MISSED DEARLY."

05:20.391 --> 05:23.594
ISN'T THAT LOVELY?
EVERYBODY'S BEEN SO GENEROUS.

05:23.594 --> 05:26.427
YEAH.
TEN JARS OF HOMEMADE JAM.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.529
I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE WAS BEING GENEROUS

05:28.529 --> 05:30.461
OR JUST CLEANING OUT
HER BASEMENT.

05:30.461 --> 05:34.935
WELL, EITHER WAY, IT'S A GESTURE
OF LOVE AND SUPPORT.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.468
MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

05:37.468 --> 05:40.010
THERE IS MY BABY BOY.

05:40.010 --> 05:42.342
MORNING, BUB.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.645
EGGS ON A RAFT,

05:44.645 --> 05:46.417
JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE 'EM.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.879
(sniffs) THESE SMELL GROSS.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.881
OKAY, UM, NOT A PROBLEM.

05:50.881 --> 05:52.783
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE
YOU'D LIKE ME TO--

05:52.783 --> 05:54.955
M.J.
 (plate clatters)

05:54.955 --> 05:56.356
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.559
UM, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.531
STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.

06:00.531 --> 06:01.932
UH, BUDDY, I DON'T THINK

06:01.932 --> 06:03.894
THAT'S THE HEALTHIEST WAY
TO START YOUR DAY.

06:03.894 --> 06:04.895
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK.

06:04.895 --> 06:06.837
WELL...

06:06.837 --> 06:08.499
MAYBE JUST THIS ONCE.

06:08.499 --> 06:11.071
I'LL GET YOU A BOWL.

06:14.405 --> 06:17.908
OR, UH, NO BOWL IS GOOD.

06:17.908 --> 06:19.450
I'M GONNA EAT THIS
IN FRONT OF THE TV.

06:19.450 --> 06:21.081
CAN YOU BRING ME
SOME SPRINKLES?

06:21.081 --> 06:23.083
OF COURSE, HONEY.

06:24.615 --> 06:26.056
UH, MOM.

06:26.056 --> 06:30.521
WHAT?
IT'S JUST ICE CREAM, OKAY?

06:30.521 --> 06:32.062
HE LOST HIS DAD.

06:32.062 --> 06:34.695
OKAY.

06:34.695 --> 06:38.569
(M.J.)
MOM, WHERE'S MY SPRINKLES?

06:38.569 --> 06:40.601
COMING!

06:40.601 --> 06:43.403
WHOA.
WHAT'S... GOING ON HERE?

06:43.403 --> 06:46.176
(chuckles) I THOUGHT I'D KICK
OFF YOUR BIG RESIGNATION DAY

06:46.176 --> 06:48.639
WITH A POWER BREAKFAST.

06:48.639 --> 06:50.911
PLUS THE EXPIRATION
ON THIS SAUSAGE WAS YESTERDAY.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.683
I GOTTA SAY,

06:52.683 --> 06:54.445
NOW THAT THE DAY IS
FINALLY HERE,

06:54.445 --> 06:55.916
I'M STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.518
DON'T YOU WORRY.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.089
I'VE MADE A DECISION.

06:59.089 --> 07:00.851
I'M GETTING A JOB.

07:00.851 --> 07:03.554
WHAT?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

07:03.554 --> 07:05.556
NO, I WANT TO.
IT'S TIME I HELP OUT.

07:05.556 --> 07:07.427
I OWE IT TO YOU.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.030
(sighs)
SO I WROTE UP A RESUME,

07:10.030 --> 07:12.833
I BOOKED A MEETING
AT AN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY,

07:12.833 --> 07:17.608
AND I EVEN BOUGHT MYSELF
A GIRLIE BRIEFCASE.

07:17.608 --> 07:19.069
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST GONNA CUT BACK,

07:19.069 --> 07:20.571
LIVE A SMALLER LIFE?

07:20.571 --> 07:23.474
YEAH, I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

07:23.474 --> 07:25.546
THEN I DECIDED
I WANT A SLIGHTLY BIGGER LIFE,

07:25.546 --> 07:27.017
SO I FIGURE IF I WORK,

07:27.017 --> 07:30.020
THE GIRLS CAN STAY IN PRIVATE
SCHOOL, WE CAN KEEP BOTH CARS,

07:30.020 --> 07:31.952
AND MAYBE EVEN TAKE

07:31.952 --> 07:34.454
ONE OF THOSE SKI TRIPS
WE TALKED ABOUT CANCELING.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.927
GABY, I LOVE
 THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP,

07:36.927 --> 07:39.990
BUT AN ENTRY-LEVEL SALARY IS NOT
GONNA COVER THE COST OF SKIS,

07:39.990 --> 07:41.962
LET ALONE FIVE NIGHTS
AT THE RITZ.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.595
WELL, MAYBE NOT NOW, BUT IF I
WORK MY WAY UP THE LADDER,

07:44.595 --> 07:46.466
IN A FEW YEARS, I'LL BE
PULLING IN THE BIG BUCKS,

07:46.466 --> 07:47.838
JUST LIKE YOU DO.

07:47.838 --> 07:49.640
OR DID.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.503
WHAT KIND OF LADDER ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

07:52.503 --> 07:54.645
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?

07:54.645 --> 07:57.007
I DON'T KNOW YET. THAT'S WHERE
THE EMPLOYMENT LADY COMES IN.

07:57.007 --> 07:58.849
SHE'S GONNA HELP ME
FIGURE OUT

07:58.849 --> 08:01.912
HOW TO BEST UTILIZE
MY "SKILL SET."

08:01.912 --> 08:04.715
YEAH, I READ THAT IN ONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS MAGAZINES.

08:04.715 --> 08:08.488
I'M PROUD OF YOU
STEPPING UP LIKE THIS.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.621
I HOPE YOU FIND A JOB
THAT HAS HEALTH CARE,

08:10.621 --> 08:12.222
'CAUSE MY BENEFITS END TODAY.

08:12.222 --> 08:13.864
WHAT?

08:13.864 --> 08:15.926
NO RISKY MEAT
WITHOUT BENEFITS.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.671
YEAH, DOUG AND I ELOPED,

08:20.671 --> 08:23.534
SO THIS TIME, I WANT
AN OVER-THE-TOP WEDDING--

08:23.534 --> 08:25.706
HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGES,
FIREWORKS,

08:25.706 --> 08:28.008
POODLES DYED PURPLE.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.780
(chuckles)

08:29.780 --> 08:31.912
UH, IS THIS WEIRD,

08:31.912 --> 08:33.744
ME GOING ON
ABOUT HOW HAPPY I AM

08:33.744 --> 08:36.616
WHILE YOU'RE ALL SAD
AND SINGLE?

08:36.616 --> 08:40.220
ACTUALLY, I'M HOPING
I WON'T BE SINGLE FOR LONG.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.623
I'VE DECIDED
TO TRY TO GET TOM BACK.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.595
SO WE'RE DONE
TALKING ABOUT ME?

08:44.595 --> 08:46.056
YEAH. KINDA.

08:46.056 --> 08:47.658
GREAT.

08:47.658 --> 08:49.099
SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

08:49.099 --> 08:50.861
I FIGURE
I'LL JUST COME CLEAN,

08:50.861 --> 08:54.635
TELL HIM I SCREWED UP,
AND BEG HIM TO COME BACK.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.608
IT'S AMAZING YOU LANDED A MAN
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

08:57.608 --> 08:58.569
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO?

08:58.569 --> 09:01.111
OH. THROW YOURSELF AT HIM.

09:01.111 --> 09:04.244
NEXT TIME HE STOPS BY, LET
A BOOB FALL OUT OF YOUR BLOUSE

09:04.244 --> 09:08.548
OR MAYBE BEND OVER
IN THOSE TIGHT-ASS JEANS.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.680
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.821
YOU'RE RIGHT. SORRY.

09:10.821 --> 09:12.653
WHAT DO I KNOW
ABOUT GETTING A MAN?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.084
OH, WAIT.

09:14.084 --> 09:15.125
A LOT.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.957
COME ON. HELP.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.659
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY
SPLITTING THEM UP.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.732
THEY JUST MOVED IN TOGETHER
AND THEY SEEM SO HAPPY.

09:21.732 --> 09:23.734
OF COURSE THEY'RE HAPPY. THEY'RE
IN THAT HONEYMOON PHASE.

09:23.734 --> 09:25.736
THEY'RE STILL TAKING TRIPS,

09:25.736 --> 09:26.867
LAUGHING
AT EACH OTHER'S JOKES,

09:26.867 --> 09:29.099
PRETENDING THEY'RE INTERESTED
IN MUSEUMS.

09:29.099 --> 09:31.141
WE HAD A HONEYMOON PHASE,
TOO.

09:31.141 --> 09:33.173
MAYBE I NEED TO REMIND HIM
OF THAT.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.705
WELL, REMIND HIM NAKED.

09:34.705 --> 09:36.647
THE ONLY TRICKY PART IS
GONNA BE GETTING HIM ALONE.

09:36.647 --> 09:39.650
JANE WATCHES HIM LIKE A HAWK,

09:39.650 --> 09:41.281
A TALL, BITCHY HAWK.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.353
WELL, WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO IT SOON.

09:43.353 --> 09:45.355
I'M NOT GONNA WASTE
A PLUS ONE AT MY WEDDING

09:45.355 --> 09:47.658
UNLESS I KNOW IT'S SERIOUS.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.363
HEY. MOM?

09:53.363 --> 09:55.025
ANDREW!

09:55.025 --> 09:56.196
OH!

09:56.196 --> 09:59.229
IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?

09:59.229 --> 10:01.171
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.
I'M REALLY GOOD.

10:01.171 --> 10:03.974
REALLY? BECAUSE YOUR SISTER
TOLD ME YOU LOST YOUR JOB.

10:03.974 --> 10:05.605
I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.738
DIDN'T YOU GET
ANY OF THE MESSAGES I LEFT?

10:07.738 --> 10:10.080
I'VE JUST BEEN REALLY BUSY.
UH, BUT EVERYTHING'S FINE.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.642
IN FACT, I MET SOMEONE.

10:11.642 --> 10:14.144
YOU DID?
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

10:14.144 --> 10:16.917
I KNOW HOW HARD
YOUR BREAKUP FROM ALEX WAS.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.249
I'M SO HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE MOVING ON.

10:19.249 --> 10:21.391
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW MONTHS,

10:21.391 --> 10:23.654
BUT, UH,
IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

10:23.654 --> 10:25.325
HOW SERIOUS?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.697
SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT WE WERE
DRIVING THROUGH TOWN,

10:26.697 --> 10:28.799
AND I THOUGHT THE TWO OF YOU
SHOULD MEET.

10:28.799 --> 10:30.801
HE'S HERE?

10:30.801 --> 10:32.062
OH.

10:32.062 --> 10:33.764
UH, YEAH, WELL, I...

10:33.764 --> 10:37.107
I WANT YOU
TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.243
WHO'S THIS?

10:43.243 --> 10:44.815
THIS IS MARY BETH,

10:44.815 --> 10:46.216
MY FIANCEE.

10:54.685 --> 10:56.426
I'M SO GLAD
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

10:56.426 --> 10:58.288
I'VE BEEN TELLING THIS GUY

10:58.288 --> 11:01.061
I CAN'T MARRY HIM
UNTIL I MEET HIS MOM.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.262
(chuckles)

11:02.262 --> 11:04.164
SO YOU'RE REALLY ENGAGED

11:04.164 --> 11:05.996
TO... EACH OTHER?

11:05.996 --> 11:07.667
UH, YEAH.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.000
YEAH, AND REMEMBER, YOU'RE HAPPY
I'VE MOVED ON, RIGHT?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.402
I JUST HAVE
SO MANY QUESTIONS.

11:12.402 --> 11:15.005
I KNOW WHAT YOU MUST
BE THINKING. IT'S TOO SOON.

11:15.005 --> 11:17.177
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M THINKING.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.779
MOM. (chuckles)

11:18.779 --> 11:20.851
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST THAT
YOU'RE VERY DIFFERENT

11:20.851 --> 11:24.454
THAN ALL OF THE OTHER... DATES
ANDREW'S BROUGHT HOME.

11:24.454 --> 11:27.858
WELL, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CHANGE.
(chuckles)

11:27.858 --> 11:29.960
SO HOW DID YOU TWO MEET
ANYWAY?

11:29.960 --> 11:31.691
OH, IT'S A REAL CUTE STORY.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.063
I WAS
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER

11:33.063 --> 11:35.065
FOR MY OVEREATERS ANONYMOUS
MEETING,

11:35.065 --> 11:37.828
BUT I WENT INTO
THE A.A. MEETING BY MISTAKE.

11:37.828 --> 11:39.399
AND BY "MISTAKE,"

11:39.399 --> 11:41.932
I MEAN I REMEMBERED HOW DRUNKS
LOVE THEIR DOUGHNUTS.

11:41.932 --> 11:44.374
SO AS I WAS REACHING
FOR A BUTTERMILK GLAZED,

11:44.374 --> 11:46.176
THERE WAS ANDREW.

11:46.176 --> 11:47.707
YOU WERE
IN OVEREATERS ANONYMOUS?

11:47.707 --> 11:50.310
YEAH, I ACTUALLY LOST
220 POUNDS

11:50.310 --> 11:54.344
AND THEN GAINED 160 POUNDS
OF GRADE "A" BEEFCAKE!

11:54.344 --> 11:55.715
(laughs)

11:55.715 --> 11:57.187
ISN'T SHE ADORABLE?

11:57.187 --> 11:58.949
UH-HUH.

11:58.949 --> 12:00.720
ANDREW, WOULD YOU HELP ME
IN THE KITCHEN?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.352
I'D LIKE TO GET
SOME TEA BISCUITS,

12:02.352 --> 12:04.154
AND THEY'RE
ON A VERY HIGH SHELF.

12:04.154 --> 12:06.356
OOH, TEA BISCUITS.

12:06.356 --> 12:09.729
46 CALORIES.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.365
(lowered voice)
ANDREW, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

12:15.365 --> 12:17.007
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

12:17.007 --> 12:19.209
LOOK, I-I KNOW IT'S NOT
WHO YOU WERE EXPECTING,

12:19.209 --> 12:22.212
BUT REMEMBER HOW YOU ALWAYS SAID
THAT BEING GAY WAS JUST A PHASE,

12:22.212 --> 12:24.044
THAT I-I JUST NEEDED
TO MEET THE RIGHT GIRL?

12:24.044 --> 12:26.146
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.948
JUST BE HAPPY FOR ME.

12:32.382 --> 12:35.385
(clock ticking)

12:37.788 --> 12:39.489
(Julie) COME ON.
BACK TO BED.

12:39.489 --> 12:41.792
M.J.,
IT IS 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.293
YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

12:43.293 --> 12:46.436
(M.J.) YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

12:46.436 --> 12:48.198
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY
TO ME?

12:48.198 --> 12:49.239
(shooting sounds, beeping)

12:49.239 --> 12:50.841
(scoffs)

12:50.841 --> 12:52.943
HEY. TURN THAT BACK ON!

12:52.943 --> 12:54.404
MNH-MNH.

12:54.404 --> 12:55.775
GUYS?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.377
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.209
I AM TRYING TO GET M.J.
BACK TO BED.

12:59.209 --> 13:00.780
I CAN'T SLEEP.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.182
YEAH, WELL, BLOWING UP ALIENS
ISN'T GONNA HELP.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.453
COME ON.

13:03.453 --> 13:05.115
NO, I WANNA PLAY MY GAME.

13:05.115 --> 13:06.386
TURN IT BACK ON NOW!

13:06.386 --> 13:08.788
SHH. SHH. DON'T GET UPSET.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.560
YOU CAN FINISH YOUR GAME.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.263
WHAT?

13:13.263 --> 13:14.524
(shooting and beeping resumes)

13:14.524 --> 13:16.496
(sighs)
JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

13:16.496 --> 13:19.069
THEN YOU HAVE TO GO
BACK TO BED, OKAY?

13:19.069 --> 13:22.802
MOM, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

13:26.576 --> 13:29.539
I THINK
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

13:29.539 --> 13:31.481
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

13:31.481 --> 13:33.083
YES, IT IS.

13:33.083 --> 13:37.417
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
HE'S GOING THROUGH IS AWFUL,

13:37.417 --> 13:39.549
BUT THIS ISN'T HELPING.

13:39.549 --> 13:41.391
HE'S TOTALLY
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

13:41.391 --> 13:44.494
HE'S NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE.

13:44.494 --> 13:46.556
HE'S TRAUMATIZED,

13:46.556 --> 13:48.458
AND IT'S KILLING ME TO SEE
WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH,

13:48.458 --> 13:51.601
SO IF I CAN
GIVE HIM A LITTLE JOY

13:51.601 --> 13:54.334
BY LETTING HIM
PLAY VIDEO GAMES,

13:54.334 --> 13:56.206
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.914
SO I'M LOOKING TO MAKE
IN THE 6-FIGURE RANGE,

14:03.914 --> 14:05.845
PLUS BENEFITS, OF COURSE.

14:05.845 --> 14:10.220
AND I HAVE TWO YOUNG GIRLS,
SO FLEXIBLE HOURS WOULD BE GOOD.

14:10.220 --> 14:12.122
AND WE ALWAYS TAKE
THIS BIG VACATION,

14:12.122 --> 14:14.454
SO I'LL NEED TWO WEEKS OFF.
MAYBE THREE.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.526
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST GIVE ME ALL OF AUGUST.

14:18.088 --> 14:21.231
(singsongy)
SO WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR ME?

14:21.231 --> 14:22.862
A REALITY CHECK.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.895
EXCUSE ME?

14:24.895 --> 14:27.497
MRS. SOLIS, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ADJUST YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

14:27.497 --> 14:29.069
UP?

14:29.069 --> 14:32.302
NO. HAVE YOU NOT BEEN READING
THE NEWSPAPERS?

14:32.302 --> 14:34.374
THE JOB MARKET RIGHT NOW
IS BRUTAL.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.546
I HAVE PEOPLE WITH PhDs
THAT I CAN'T FIND JOBS FOR,

14:36.546 --> 14:40.981
AND FRANKLY, YOUR JOB EXPERIENCE
IS VERY LIMITED.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.253
MODELING,
MODELING, MODELING.

14:43.253 --> 14:45.415
OKAY. OKAY. (scoffs) OKAY.

14:45.415 --> 14:46.616
PRINT,

14:46.616 --> 14:47.887
RUNWAY,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.389
BOAT SHOW.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.561
(chuckles)
WHO'S THE JOB EXPERT HERE?

14:51.561 --> 14:54.064
PLUS,
THERE'S A 15-YEAR GAP HERE.

14:54.064 --> 14:56.626
YEAH, TO BE A DOTING WIFE
AND A LOVING MOTHER OF TWO.

14:56.626 --> 14:59.069
YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE
WITH CHILDREN.
 (types)

14:59.069 --> 15:02.132
I HAVE A JOB
AT A DAY CARE CENTER.

15:02.132 --> 15:04.234
AND DEAL
WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS?

15:04.234 --> 15:05.535
I DON'T EVEN LIKE MY OWN.

15:05.535 --> 15:07.607
LOOK,
YOU DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE,

15:07.607 --> 15:09.539
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE
HIGH SCHOOL,

15:09.539 --> 15:11.911
AND YOUR ONLY REFERENCES ARE

15:11.911 --> 15:13.944
PHOTOGRAPHERS
AND AGING ROCK STARS.

15:13.944 --> 15:17.017
IN TODAY'S MARKET,
YOU'RE BASICALLY UNEMPLOYABLE.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.920
AND YOU ACTUALLY GET PAID
FOR THIS?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.522
SO NOW WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

15:22.522 --> 15:25.255
WELL, YOU COULD START PLANNING
THAT AUGUST VACATION.

15:32.462 --> 15:35.065
GABRIELLE SOLIS WAS DEPRESSED,

15:35.065 --> 15:37.107
AND WHEN SHE WAS DEPRESSED,

15:37.107 --> 15:41.071
NOTHING LIFTED HER SPIRITS
LIKE A GOOD WORKOUT...

15:41.071 --> 15:43.473
OF HER CREDIT CARD.

15:43.473 --> 15:45.115
MAY I HELP YOU?

15:45.115 --> 15:47.177
YEAH, UH, I JUST WANNA GET
THAT LITTLE RED SCARF

15:47.177 --> 15:49.549
I SAW IN THE WINDOW.
THEN I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.950
ALL RIGHT.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.083
ALTHOUGH THAT...

15:53.083 --> 15:56.026
(inhales deeply) BLACK SHEATH
DRESS WOULD GO PERFECT WITH IT.

15:56.026 --> 15:57.057
MM.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.659
(gasps) LOOK AT
THOSE OVER-THE-KNEE BOOTS!

15:59.659 --> 16:00.991
(gasps)

16:00.991 --> 16:02.432
OKAY. WHO AM I KIDDING?

16:02.432 --> 16:04.564
GET ME A DOUBLE CAPPUCCINO
AND MUSCULAR STOCK BOY.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.197
MAMA NEEDS
A NEW PAIR OF EVERYTHING.

16:14.144 --> 16:16.206
I SAID TAUPE.
THIS IS CLEARLY BEIGE.

16:16.206 --> 16:18.078
WE DON'T HAVE IT IN TAUPE.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.180
SECOND FLOOR, THIRD MANNEQUIN
FROM THE LEFT. LOOK ALIVE.

16:21.711 --> 16:23.513
I'LL TRY THESE IN PLUM,

16:23.513 --> 16:25.155
THESE IN LEOPARD,

16:25.155 --> 16:27.157
THESE... OH, FORGET IT.

16:27.157 --> 16:29.659
NO LADY WANTS TO SEE
ANYTHING UNDER 4 INCHES.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.096
YOU GO WITH YOU.
YOU GO WITH YOU.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.468
YOU GO AWAY.

16:41.731 --> 16:44.374
NO ONE'S BEEN ABLE
TO MAKE THAT ROMPER WORK.

16:44.374 --> 16:45.775
SHOULD WE HELP HER?

16:45.775 --> 16:48.508
STAY BACK.
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.183
NAVY BLAZER, SILVER HOOP
EARRINGS, PLATFORM WEDGE.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.588
AND A RED
PATENT LEATHER CLUTCH.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.353
GENIUS! GENIUS.

17:09.159 --> 17:13.603
EVERYTHING LOOKS AND SMELLS
SO AMAZING, MRS. VAN DE KAMP.

17:13.603 --> 17:15.265
DO YOU MIND
IF I TAKE A PICTURE?

17:15.265 --> 17:16.306
OF THE FOOD?

17:16.306 --> 17:18.167
THAT WAY I EAT
JUST A LITTLE BIT NOW,

17:18.167 --> 17:20.109
AND THEN LATER,
WHEN I'M HUNGRY,

17:20.109 --> 17:22.311
I CAN LOOK AT THE PICTURE
AND GET FULL ON THE MEMORY.

17:22.311 --> 17:25.044
(camera shutter clicks)
 DON'T YOU JUST
WANNA EAT HER UP?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.415
NOT BEFORE I TAKE
A PICTURE OF HER.

17:28.178 --> 17:29.719
YOU KNOW, MARY BETH,

17:29.719 --> 17:31.421
I JUST REALIZED I DON'T KNOW
A THING ABOUT YOU.

17:31.421 --> 17:33.183
WHAT DO YOU DO?

17:33.183 --> 17:34.224
WELL, ACTUALLY, NOTHING.

17:34.224 --> 17:36.226
MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN
PRETTY GENEROUS.

17:36.226 --> 17:38.088
OH, REALLY? WHAT, UH,
SORT OF WORK ARE THEY IN?

17:38.088 --> 17:39.359
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, MOM.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.790
NO, NO. IT'S OKAY.

17:40.790 --> 17:43.693
THEY INVENTED
MARY BETH'S FROZEN CUSTARD.

17:43.693 --> 17:46.736
MARY BETH?
YOU'RE THAT MARY BETH?

17:46.736 --> 17:50.069
RECOGNIZE ME?
THE KID ON THE CARTON?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.741
(gasps) IT'S IN EVERY
SUPERMARKET IN THE COUNTRY.

17:51.741 --> 17:54.574
IT MUST BE
A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR--

17:56.776 --> 17:58.178
OH.

18:01.751 --> 18:03.713
WOULD YOU HELP ME
IN THE KITCHEN, ANDREW?

18:03.713 --> 18:05.255
NOW.
 (utensils clatter)

18:05.255 --> 18:07.117
(sighs)

18:08.188 --> 18:10.720
ANDREW, I KNEW YOU WERE
HAVING FINANCIAL TROUBLES,

18:10.720 --> 18:12.762
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D STOOP TO THIS.

18:12.762 --> 18:14.624
WHAT?
 SHE'S AN HEIRESS.

18:14.624 --> 18:16.496
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY MARRYING HER
FOR HER MONEY.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.828
I'M MARRYING HER
BECAUSE I'M CRAZY ABOUT HER.

18:18.828 --> 18:21.301
WE LOVE THE SAME MOVIES.
SHE MAKES ME LAUGH.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.103
SHE GETS ME.
SHE'S REALLY AN AMAZING GIRL.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.276
(singsongy) I THINK
I FOUND YOUR GOOD SIDE!

18:26.276 --> 18:28.338
SMILE, GNOCCHI.
 (camera shutter clicks)

18:28.338 --> 18:29.809
SHE'S DISTURBED.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.242
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
SHE'S A LITTLE ECCENTRIC,

18:32.242 --> 18:34.884
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOVE HER.

18:34.884 --> 18:38.117
ANDREW VAN DE KAMP,
YOU LOVE ITALIAN SHOES.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.220
YOU LOVE
MID-CENTURY MODERN FURNITURE.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.592
AND ACCORDING TO YOUR
INTERNET HISTORY, YOU LOVE...

18:42.592 --> 18:46.156
ARMY DOCTORS GIVING ELABORATE
PHYSICALS TO YOUNG RECRUITS.

18:46.156 --> 18:48.498
BUT YOU DO NOT LOVE GIRLS.

18:48.498 --> 18:50.300
WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT
THAT I'VE CHANGED?

18:50.300 --> 18:52.262
BECAUSE HOMOSEXUALITY
IS NOT A CHOICE.

18:52.262 --> 18:53.633
YOU WERE BORN THIS WAY.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.465
I'M THE ONE
WHO TOLD YOU THAT.

18:55.465 --> 18:56.836
AND IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME,

18:56.836 --> 18:59.439
BUT I WAS FINALLY ABLE
TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT.

18:59.439 --> 19:03.273
HONEY, YOU'RE HERE, YOU'RE

QUALIFIED TO DO ANYTHING.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.782

22:38.558 --> 22:40.390

A MOMENT ALONE?

22:50.770 --> 22:52.602
HELLO?

22:52.602 --> 22:54.804
YES, THIS IS HIS MOTHER.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.777
HE DID WHAT?

22:57.777 --> 22:59.849
HE THREW A STAPLER AT YOU?

22:59.849 --> 23:01.911
YES, RIGHT AT MY HEAD.

23:01.911 --> 23:03.853
ARE YOU SURE
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT?

23:03.853 --> 23:06.756
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
AIMING AT YOUR HEAD.

23:06.756 --> 23:08.458
WHAT HE SAID WAS--

23:08.458 --> 23:10.520
AND I WROTE THIS DOWN
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE EXACT--

23:10.520 --> 23:11.861
"LEAVE ME ALONE,

23:11.861 --> 23:14.794
OR I'M GOING TO THROW
THIS STAPLER AT YOUR HEAD."

23:14.794 --> 23:16.826

JUST LOST HIS FATHER, RIGHT?

23:19.469 --> 23:22.572
I DO. MY HEART GOES OUT
TO BOTH OF YOU.

23:22.572 --> 23:24.874

FOR VIOLENCE IN MY CLASSROOM,

ARE AT HOME.

23:29.439 --> 23:31.040
UM...

23:31.040 --> 23:34.814

JUST LOST HIS FAVORITE TOY

23:34.814 --> 23:36.886
OR A PET TURTLE.

23:36.886 --> 23:39.088
HE... LOST HIS DAD.

23:39.088 --> 23:41.821
YES, BUT IF M.J. HAD THROWN
THAT STAPLER A LITTLE HARDER,

23:41.821 --> 23:44.423
MY GRANDKIDS MIGHT HAVE LOST
THEIR GRANDMOTHER.

23:45.755 --> 23:47.857
WELL, I'M SURE
THAT HE IS SORRY.

23:47.857 --> 23:50.900
HE ISN'T. IN FACT,

23:50.900 --> 23:52.532
"BULL'S-EYE."

REMOVED FROM MY CLASS.

HARD TO BELIEVE

SO MUCH TIME WITH CHILDREN

24:07.116 --> 24:10.850
COULD BE SO OBLIVIOUS
TO A CHILD'S PAIN.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.683

I NEED TO PROTECT.

24:13.683 --> 24:16.656

A VERY ANGRY LITTLE BOY.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.988

24:18.988 --> 24:20.490

24:20.490 --> 24:24.494
AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
AND LOVING PEOPLE

24:24.494 --> 24:27.166

RIPPED AWAY FROM HIM,

24:27.166 --> 24:30.039

TO LIVE WITH THE FACT

24:30.039 --> 24:32.872
THAT HIS FATHER IS
NEVER COMING BACK.

I KNOW.
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.489
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE ELECTRIC COMPANY,

29:20.489 --> 29:22.761
AND IT TURNS OUT
IT'S A FAULTY LINE,

29:22.761 --> 29:25.164
SO THEY'RE GONNA FIX IT
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.765
SO YOU DON'T NEED ME
TO LOOK AT ANYTHING OR--

29:26.765 --> 29:28.868
I'M SORRY.
I FEEL TERRIBLE DRAGGING YOU

29:28.868 --> 29:30.239
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE,

29:30.239 --> 29:32.872
SO YOU WANT SOMETHING FOR
YOUR TROUBLE? A DRINK OR--

29:32.872 --> 29:34.874
NAH. NO. NO. I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN YOUR HAIR.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.375
NO, NO. YOU'RE NOT.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.977
HONESTLY,
IT'S A LITTLE SCARY

29:37.977 --> 29:41.310
BEING ALL ALONE IN A DARK HOUSE.
(chuckles)

29:41.310 --> 29:43.552
HENCE
THE HUNDREDS OF CANDLES.

29:43.552 --> 29:46.485
YEAH, I DID GO
A LITTLE OVERBOARD, HUH?

29:46.485 --> 29:48.517
WHAT ARE YOU COOKING?

29:48.517 --> 29:50.890
IT SMELLS AMAZING IN HERE.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.492
YEAH? I'M TRYING OUT
A NEW RECIPE FOR THE KIDS.

29:53.492 --> 29:54.864
BEEF BOURGUIGNONNE.

29:54.864 --> 29:56.795
BUT PENNY'S WITH JANE

29:56.795 --> 29:59.398
AND PARKER'S HAVING PIZZA
WITH THE MARTINDALES.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.400
I LOVE BEEF BOURGUIGNONNE.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.503
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.575
Y-YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
WE TRIED IT?

30:06.575 --> 30:09.308
NEW YORK.
OUR SECOND ANNIVERSARY.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.981
OH, THAT MUST BE
WHERE I GOT THE IDEA.

30:11.981 --> 30:14.884
I WAS JUST LOOKING AT PICTURES
FROM THAT TRIP.

30:14.884 --> 30:16.886
OH, YEAH? YOU--YOU GOT OUT
THE OLD PHOTO ALBUM?

30:16.886 --> 30:17.987
YEAH.

30:17.987 --> 30:20.249
OH, HO HO. MAN!

30:20.249 --> 30:22.391
LOOK AT US.

30:22.391 --> 30:25.324
HEY.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.556
WHY DON'T YOU STAY FOR DINNER?
I'LL MAKE YOU A PLATE.

30:27.556 --> 30:29.828
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.101
COME ON.
JANE'S AT THE CONCERT.

30:32.101 --> 30:33.462
WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER DO--

30:33.462 --> 30:35.935
EAT A MICROWAVE DINNER
ALL ALONE IN YOUR APARTMENT

30:35.935 --> 30:38.037
OR...

30:38.037 --> 30:39.268
BEEF BOURGUIGNONNE?

30:39.268 --> 30:41.340
WELL...

30:41.340 --> 30:43.572
I HATE FOR IT
TO GO TO WASTE.

30:43.572 --> 30:44.974
(chuckles)

30:44.974 --> 30:47.346
(lid clatters)

30:51.480 --> 30:54.353
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.956
MARY BETH IS ON HER WAY
BACK TO WISCONSIN.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.087
I'M SORRY.

30:58.087 --> 31:00.259
WHY ARE YOU SO CONCERNED
ABOUT HER LIFE?

31:00.259 --> 31:02.191
WHAT ABOUT ME?!
I'M YOUR SON.

31:02.191 --> 31:04.863
I DID THIS FOR YOU.
CAN YOU LOOK ME IN THE EYE

31:04.863 --> 31:06.435
AND TELL ME
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN HAPPY

31:06.435 --> 31:08.267
SPENDING THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
WITH THAT WOMAN?

31:08.267 --> 31:11.600
THAT MARRIAGE REALLY
 COULD HAVE HELPED ME OUT,

31:11.600 --> 31:14.143
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH HELP I NEED.

31:14.143 --> 31:15.975
WHY? WHAT IS GOING ON?

31:15.975 --> 31:19.248
WHERE DO I START? UM...

31:19.248 --> 31:22.611
WELL, I TOOK A LOSS ON THE HOUSE
THAT YOU GOT ME,

31:22.611 --> 31:25.454
I, UH, I LOST MY JOB,

31:25.454 --> 31:27.486
CAN'T FIND A NEW ONE.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.189
I HAVE A TON
OF CREDIT CARD DEBT,

31:30.189 --> 31:33.522
AND MARY BETH WAS WILLING
TO HELP ME OUT WITH ALL OF THAT.

31:33.522 --> 31:36.625
WELL, SO WOULD I. WHY DIDN'T
YOU COME TO ME FOR HELP?

31:36.625 --> 31:38.627
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING BACK

31:38.627 --> 31:41.530
TO YOUR MOTHER TO FIX
YOUR PROBLEMS?

31:41.530 --> 31:44.233
MY WHOLE LIFE,
YOU'VE BEEN PROPPING ME UP--

31:44.233 --> 31:48.177
WHEN I NEEDED A JOB, WHEN I WAS
DUMPED, WHEN I WAS DRINKING.

31:48.177 --> 31:50.109
I'M JUST--I'M SO TIRED

31:50.109 --> 31:53.412
OF YOU SEEING ME
AS A FAILURE.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.284
ANDREW, IF YOU WOULD
GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS

31:55.284 --> 31:57.316
RATHER THAN COME TO ME
FOR HELP,

31:57.316 --> 32:00.919
THEN I AM THE ONE
WHO'S FAILED.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.552
(sighs)

32:03.552 --> 32:06.255
HOW ABOUT WE JUST AGREE
THAT WE BOTH FAILED?

32:09.959 --> 32:11.160
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

32:11.160 --> 32:14.233
I DON'T KNOW. I HAD
A PRETTY GOOD SETUP THERE--

32:14.233 --> 32:17.106
A PLACE TO LIVE,
SOMEBODY WHO NEEDED ME,

32:17.106 --> 32:19.138
ALL THE FROZEN CUSTARD
I COULD EAT.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.040
WELL,
I DON'T HAVE ANY CUSTARD,

32:21.040 --> 32:23.512
BUT I CAN OFFER YOU
A PLACE TO STAY,

32:23.512 --> 32:27.716
AND... SOMEONE ELSE
WHO NEEDS YOU.

32:29.178 --> 32:31.981
ALL RIGHT.

32:31.981 --> 32:34.553
BUT JUST UNTIL I GET
BACK ON MY FEET AGAIN.

32:38.988 --> 32:42.231
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
THAT PARTY.

32:42.231 --> 32:46.695
I COULD SWEAR I SAW BRYAN
WITH A "Y" CHECKING YOU OUT.

32:46.695 --> 32:48.697
AH, WELL, ACTUALLY,

32:48.697 --> 32:51.370
I AM MORE INTO
GEOFFREY WITH A "G."

32:51.370 --> 32:54.703
NOW THAT'S MY GAY SON.
 (chuckles)

32:57.006 --> 32:59.008
GOD, LOOK AT ALL THE STUFF
WE'RE DOING.

32:59.008 --> 33:00.579
WE USED TO BE INTERESTING.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.652
I KNOW. WE--WE HIKED.
WE WENT TO THE THEATER.

33:03.652 --> 33:06.685
WE--WE TOOK SALSA LESSONS.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.358
AND THEN CAME THE KIDS.

33:09.358 --> 33:11.420
AH, FUN KILLERS. HUH.

33:11.420 --> 33:12.461
(chuckles)

33:14.423 --> 33:16.465
MMM. THIS IS AMAZING.
 (fork clatters)

33:16.465 --> 33:19.098
IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN
THAT RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.530
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT PLACE WAS PRETTY GOOD.

33:21.530 --> 33:23.132
HOW DID WE EVEN FIND IT?

33:23.132 --> 33:25.074
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?
 MNH-MNH.

33:25.074 --> 33:27.606
WE GOT CAUGHT
IN THAT TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.738
WE DUCKED IN THERE
TO DRY OFF.

33:29.738 --> 33:32.281
RIGHT.
AND THEN THE OWNER INSISTED

33:32.281 --> 33:33.782
ON MAKING US A SPECIAL MEAL

33:33.782 --> 33:36.715
BECAUSE WE HAD
THAT NEWLYWED LOOK. (chuckles)

33:40.249 --> 33:42.791
A LOT OF WATER
UNDER THAT BRIDGE, HUH?

33:42.791 --> 33:46.195
YEAH, BUT IT WAS
A PRETTY STRONG BRIDGE.

33:49.027 --> 33:53.102
LOOK HOW YOUNG WE WERE.

33:53.102 --> 33:54.133
YEAH.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.034
(laughs)

33:56.034 --> 33:59.768
BACK THEN I COULD ACTUALLY SEE
WITHOUT MY READING GLASSES.

33:59.768 --> 34:02.271
HERE YOU GO.
BEST I CAN DO FOR LIGHT.

34:02.271 --> 34:05.074
THANK YOU.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.248
OH.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.719
HA HA HA.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.821
I'M GLAD YOU KEPT THESE.

34:12.821 --> 34:17.085
GOOD MEMORIES, HUH?

34:17.085 --> 34:18.327
YEAH.

34:18.327 --> 34:22.130
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES YOU JUST GET...

34:22.130 --> 34:25.764
OVERWHELMED BY WORK AND...

34:25.764 --> 34:28.667
KIDS AND LIFE,
AND IT'S JUST...

34:28.667 --> 34:31.069
SO EASY TO...

34:32.841 --> 34:34.342
FORGET.

34:34.342 --> 34:36.844
YEAH.

34:36.844 --> 34:40.849
YEAH, IT IS.

34:40.849 --> 34:41.850
(flame whooshes)

34:41.850 --> 34:43.081
I'M ON FIRE.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.254
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!
I'M ON FIRE!

34:45.254 --> 34:47.356
OH! OH, MY GOD! OH!

34:47.356 --> 34:48.617
AH!

34:48.617 --> 34:50.088
UH...

34:50.088 --> 34:51.760
OH. (sighs)

34:51.760 --> 34:53.121
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:53.121 --> 34:55.123
I THINK I BURNT THE SKIN.

34:55.123 --> 34:57.826
OH, JEEZ. LET ME SEE.

34:57.826 --> 34:59.097
(switch clicks)

34:59.097 --> 35:00.869
(sighs)

35:00.869 --> 35:03.472
OH, IT DOESN'T LOOK
SO BAD.

35:03.472 --> 35:06.635
I THOUGHT THE POWER
WAS OUT.

35:06.635 --> 35:09.708
THEY MUST HAVE...
FIXED IT.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.280
YOU SET THIS UP.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.142
YOU KNOW,
IN--IN MY DEFENSE, I--

35:13.142 --> 35:14.213
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

35:14.213 --> 35:16.345
I JUST WANTED
TO SEE WHERE WE STOOD,

35:16.345 --> 35:18.347
IF THERE WAS STILL
ANYTHING BETWEEN US,

35:18.347 --> 35:22.391
IF WE COULD FIND OUR WAY BACK
TO THOSE PEOPLE IN THE PICTURES.

35:22.391 --> 35:23.852
BY TRICKING ME?

35:23.852 --> 35:26.255
I'M--I'M SORRY ABOUT
HOW I DID IT,

35:26.255 --> 35:29.298
BUT YOU CAN'T DENY
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

35:29.298 --> 35:31.500
YOU STILL FEEL SOMETHING.

35:31.500 --> 35:35.334
JANE JUST MOVED IN WITH ME,

35:35.334 --> 35:38.507
AND YOU DO THIS NOW?

35:44.473 --> 35:46.815
(door opens)

35:46.815 --> 35:49.348
(door closes)

35:54.183 --> 35:55.224
HEY, MOM.

35:55.224 --> 35:57.326
HEY. HOW WAS THE CONCERT?

35:57.326 --> 35:58.527
AWESOME.

35:58.527 --> 35:59.658
HOW'D IT GO WITH DAD?

35:59.658 --> 36:01.790
NOT SO AWESOME.

36:01.790 --> 36:04.333
YEAH, I KINDA GOT THAT
FROM THE SWEATPANTS.

36:04.333 --> 36:06.235
MM. COME HERE, YOU.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.437
HI.

36:08.437 --> 36:12.201
MM. HI.
 (kisses and chuckles)

36:12.201 --> 36:13.942
SO NOW WHAT?

36:13.942 --> 36:16.875
I... DON'T KNOW.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.777
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU CAN'T DO.

36:18.777 --> 36:19.908
MM?

36:19.908 --> 36:21.250
GIVE UP.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.553
TAYLOR SWIFT HAS THIS SONG...

36:24.553 --> 36:26.615
MM. MM-HMM.

36:26.615 --> 36:28.687
"YOU BELONG WITH ME."
IT'S...

36:28.687 --> 36:30.659
ABOUT HOW SHE WON'T
STOP LOVING THIS GUY

36:30.659 --> 36:33.392
EVEN THOUGH
HE'S WITH THE WRONG GIRL.

36:33.392 --> 36:36.495
AND WHEN
SHE SANG IT TONIGHT,

36:36.495 --> 36:38.567
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS YOU AND DAD.

36:38.567 --> 36:41.870
AND THIS GUY SHE LOVES--

36:41.870 --> 36:44.233
DOES HE EVENTUALLY
COME TO HIS SENSES?

36:44.233 --> 36:47.836
(scoffs) IT WOULDN'T BE
A VERY GOOD VIDEO IF HE DIDN'T.

36:49.578 --> 36:51.280
AND DON'T WORRY.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.511
DAD WILL, TOO.

36:52.511 --> 36:55.444
YOU THINK?

36:55.444 --> 36:58.687
MOM,
YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR HIM.

36:58.687 --> 37:00.719
WHAT GUY DOESN'T LIKE THAT?

37:00.719 --> 37:01.950
(chuckles)

37:01.950 --> 37:04.753
YOU KNOW...

37:04.753 --> 37:06.655
WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING
REALLY SMART LIKE THAT,

37:06.655 --> 37:09.698
IT MAKES ME THINK
I DID A REALLY GOOD JOB.

37:12.761 --> 37:15.464
YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA BLISTER?

37:15.464 --> 37:17.466
IT'S A FIRST-DEGREE BURN.

37:17.466 --> 37:18.967
TOM, YOU'LL BE FINE.

37:18.967 --> 37:20.769
BUT AS YOUR PHYSICIAN,

37:20.769 --> 37:24.513
LET ME RECOMMEND--
NO MORE CANDLELIT BATHS ALONE.

37:24.513 --> 37:26.445
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.747
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS I CAN
DECLARE YOU HEALTHY ENOUGH

37:28.747 --> 37:32.521
FOR ANY AND ALL
SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.926
ACTUALLY...

37:37.926 --> 37:40.028
I NEED
TO GET SOME WORK DONE.

37:40.028 --> 37:42.561
OH.

37:42.561 --> 37:43.762
OKAY.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.934
WELL, THE NICE THING ABOUT US
LIVING TOGETHER--

37:45.934 --> 37:49.638
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.477
OKAY.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.779
THAT'S THE LAST OF THEM.

38:00.779 --> 38:01.910
OKAY.

38:01.910 --> 38:05.484
ACTUALLY,
WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.

38:06.555 --> 38:09.057
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

38:09.057 --> 38:11.490
IS THIS ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED AT SCHOOL?

38:11.490 --> 38:13.322
YES.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.297
YOU NEED TO KNOW
THAT IT IS NEVER OKAY

38:19.297 --> 38:20.899
TO THROW A STAPLER
AT SOMEONE.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.801
I KNOW.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.733
IT'S ALSO NEVER OKAY

38:24.733 --> 38:27.035
TO SWEEP A BUNCH OF STUFF
OFF SOMEONE'S DESK

38:27.035 --> 38:31.680
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT
THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT YOUR SON.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.743
PARTICULARLY IF THEY'VE
JUST HAD BUNION SURGERY.

38:34.743 --> 38:36.815
YOU DID THAT
TO MRS. BUTTERS?

38:36.815 --> 38:39.087
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT,
BUT YEAH.

38:39.087 --> 38:41.790
I WAS REALLY MAD.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.953
JUST LIKE YOU.

38:44.953 --> 38:51.800
M.J., SOMETHING HORRIBLE
HAPPENED TO YOU,

38:51.800 --> 38:56.004
AND EVERY TIME YOU STARTED
TO GET ANGRY ABOUT IT,

38:56.004 --> 39:01.640
I WANTED TO COVER IT UP
WITH ICE CREAM OR VIDEO GAMES,

39:01.640 --> 39:06.344
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
WE SHOULDN'T COVER IT UP.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.477
WE SHOULD LET IT OUT.

39:10.949 --> 39:14.783
NOW WE CAN'T HURT PEOPLE...

39:15.954 --> 39:18.827
BUT WE CAN...

39:18.827 --> 39:21.690
HURT JAM.

39:23.792 --> 39:25.594
AH.

39:25.594 --> 39:26.935
(sighs)

39:26.935 --> 39:29.398
(grunts)

39:29.398 --> 39:30.839
MOM!

39:30.839 --> 39:34.042
PEOPLE SENT US THIS
TO HELP US FEEL BETTER,

39:34.042 --> 39:36.445
AND IT'S GOING TO,

39:36.445 --> 39:37.876
JUST NOT IN THE WAY
THEY THOUGHT.

39:39.948 --> 39:41.810
(grunts)

39:41.810 --> 39:44.813
COME ON, BUDDY.

39:44.813 --> 39:46.985
YOU GOT A LOT
TO BE ANGRY ABOUT.

39:48.817 --> 39:52.060
(voice breaking)
WHAT HAPPENED... SUCKS.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.900
(glass shatters)
 (grunts)

40:18.947 --> 40:20.949
OH, SWEETIE.

40:20.949 --> 40:23.151
(sniffles and cries)

40:23.151 --> 40:24.753
I LOVE YOU.

40:24.753 --> 40:26.955
I LOVE YOU.

40:26.955 --> 40:30.428
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.503
THAT'S A CAKE I MADE
FOR A WEDDING A FEW YEARS AGO.

40:34.503 --> 40:35.834
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.006
IT'S TOO EXTRAVAGANT.
 IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH.

40:38.006 --> 40:41.139
OH. WELL, I SUPPOSE
WE COULD ADD ANOTHER TIER.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.941
MAKE IT TWO.

40:42.941 --> 40:46.815
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS,
BREE.

40:46.815 --> 40:48.977
BEN IS SUCH A GUY.

40:48.977 --> 40:51.019
HE'S NOT GONNA BE ANY HELP
PLANNING THIS WEDDING.

40:51.019 --> 40:52.881
YES, ESPECIALLY SINCE
HE'S DEALING

40:52.881 --> 40:55.724
WITH THE NASTY BUSINESS
OF THE BODY.

40:55.724 --> 40:58.156
OH, THAT?
NO, BEN'S IN THE CLEAR.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.558
REALLY?

40:59.558 --> 41:01.630
YEAH, THE COPS CALLED
THIS MORNING.

41:01.630 --> 41:03.962
UH, THEY FIGURED OUT
THE GUY THEY FOUND

41:03.962 --> 41:05.894
DIED EIGHT MONTHS AGO.

41:05.894 --> 41:07.696
THAT WAS WAY BEFORE
BEN STARTED CONSTRUCTION.

41:07.696 --> 41:08.967
OH.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.770
YEAH, THE COPS THINK THE GUY
WAS JUST SOME POOR DRIFTER.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.071
ANYWAY, IT'S OVER.

41:13.071 --> 41:14.002
OH, GOOD.

41:14.002 --> 41:15.974
WELL, NOW WE CAN FOCUS
ALL OUR ENERGY

41:15.974 --> 41:19.077
ON GIVING YOU THE BEST WEDDING
IN THE WORLD.

41:19.077 --> 41:22.250
TOMORROW WE'LL START
OUR PLANNING.

41:24.082 --> 41:27.656
YES, IN LIFE,

41:27.656 --> 41:32.821
WHEN WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY,
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT,

41:32.821 --> 41:35.023
WHETHER IT'S THE HOPE

41:35.023 --> 41:38.967
OF WINNING BACK
THE LOVE OF OUR LIFE...

41:38.967 --> 41:44.032
A SHOT AT PROVING OUR WORTH...

41:45.604 --> 41:51.209
OR THE CHANCE TO SHOW A CHILD
THE RIGHT PATH.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.184
(telephone ringing)

41:56.184 --> 41:59.047
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN WE ANSWER
THE CALL...

41:59.047 --> 42:00.188
(beep)
 HELLO?

42:00.188 --> 42:01.850
Hi. It's Bree.

42:01.850 --> 42:06.094
(click)
 WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT OPPORTUNITY AWAITS US.

42:06.094 --> 42:08.026
RENEE JUST TOLD ME
THE GOOD NEWS,

42:08.026 --> 42:11.930
AND I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR KEEPING MY SECRET.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.603
AH, NO WORRIES.
I TOLD YOU I WOULD.

42:14.603 --> 42:16.905
I know, but even when suspicion
moved on to you,

42:16.905 --> 42:19.167
you still protected me,
and that's very honorable.

42:19.167 --> 42:20.969
Really, it was no big deal.

42:20.969 --> 42:22.040
Maybe not to you.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.713
You're not the one
who put a body in the ground.

42:24.713 --> 42:26.715
You have to understand,
a day doesn't go by

42:26.715 --> 42:30.078
when that does not weigh heavily
on my conscience.

42:30.078 --> 42:32.050
GOTCHA.
