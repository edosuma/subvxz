WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:02.569
BERLUTI: Previously
on The Practice.

00:02.602 --> 00:04.404
WILSON: Massachusetts
is a no-fault state.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.372
Your wife's infidelity
is a non-issue.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.909
She didn't just cheat on me,
Ms. Wilson.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.977
She did so
with my best friend.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.478
I have two young kids.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.880
I'll represent you, Roland.

00:13.914 --> 00:14.981
Sheila...

00:15.015 --> 00:16.181
And I don't think
we should just file

00:16.216 --> 00:17.518
a claim against her.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.886
I think we should prosecute
that best man, as well.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.555
ROLAND: Richard and my wife

00:21.588 --> 00:22.889
were having intercourse

00:22.923 --> 00:24.591
in my house,

00:24.625 --> 00:25.592
in my bed.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.993
And then what happened?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.195
Well, they looked at me,

00:29.229 --> 00:30.631
they stopped,

00:30.664 --> 00:32.165
and they started up again.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.466
With you in the room?

00:33.499 --> 00:34.968
ROLAND: Yes.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.437
They didn't even have
the decency to stop.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.140
NANCY: Little news flash
the kids aren't yours.

00:40.173 --> 00:40.974
They're Richard's.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.408
Nancy.
What?

00:42.442 --> 00:43.476
NANCY: So drop this case,

00:43.510 --> 00:44.978
or you'll never see them again.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.647
(door bell dings)

00:46.680 --> 00:47.413
Roland.

00:47.447 --> 00:48.949
I think I need a lawyer.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.484
I don't wanna go to jail.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.787
You shot two people.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.989
They were fornicating
in my bed again.

00:56.022 --> 00:56.790
YOUNG: I understand,

00:56.823 --> 00:58.024
but it's very important

00:58.058 --> 00:59.626
that you don't talk
to anybody but us.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.034
I still love her, you know.

01:02.669 --> 01:03.870
I shot her,

01:05.438 --> 01:06.607
but I love her.

01:08.241 --> 01:09.776
You think you're clever,
Counsel.

01:09.809 --> 01:12.478
Hey, Judge, if you think
I crossed a line,

01:12.513 --> 01:13.780
call a mistrial.

01:13.814 --> 01:15.549
Is that what's going on?
You want a mistrial?

01:15.582 --> 01:17.350
You told me
what I couldn't argue.

01:17.383 --> 01:18.885
You got any problem
with me now,

01:18.919 --> 01:20.120
then it must be personal.

01:20.153 --> 01:23.023
I take my courtroom
very personal. And if...

01:23.056 --> 01:25.125
If I crossed a line,
call a mistrial.

01:27.327 --> 01:28.729
I'm able to have a relationship

01:28.762 --> 01:30.063
outside of work.

01:30.096 --> 01:31.732
When's the last time?

01:31.765 --> 01:34.067
I believe I'm having one now.

01:41.908 --> 01:44.110
Eugene, I'm a person
who believes

01:44.144 --> 01:45.546
in admitting my wrongs,

01:45.579 --> 01:48.214
but is it really,
really such a big deal

01:48.248 --> 01:50.517
that I mistakenly used
your toothbrush?

01:50.551 --> 01:53.720
First, we've had this
conversation before,

01:53.754 --> 01:56.122
so how do you mistakenly use

01:56.156 --> 01:57.390
my toothbrush?

01:57.423 --> 01:58.258
Second,

01:58.291 --> 01:59.292
it is my toothbrush,

01:59.325 --> 02:01.535
used to clean my mouth,

02:01.568 --> 02:03.804
and I like the bristle dry.

02:03.837 --> 02:06.039
Third, I never said
it was such a big deal.

02:06.072 --> 02:07.307
I can promise you

02:07.340 --> 02:09.876
that your bristle
won't be getting wet tonight.

02:10.610 --> 02:12.078
Oh, really?
(telephone rings)

02:16.916 --> 02:18.017
Hello?

02:19.686 --> 02:21.421
Now? I mean,
it's half past 7:00.

02:24.124 --> 02:25.058
Fine.

02:27.628 --> 02:29.462
Judge Fox wants to see me
in her chambers.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.131
Now?

02:33.299 --> 02:35.268
I'm an early riser.
I can see you're not.

02:36.202 --> 02:37.270
What's going on?

02:37.303 --> 02:39.372
FOX: You have a new client,
Mr. Young.

02:39.405 --> 02:40.741
His name is Jonathan Macklin.

02:41.708 --> 02:43.043
His trial begins next week.

02:43.076 --> 02:44.377
Hence, time is of the essence.

02:44.410 --> 02:46.713
Jonathan Macklin,
the one in the news?

02:46.747 --> 02:48.549
The very one.

02:48.582 --> 02:49.750
File's been sent over
to your office.

02:49.783 --> 02:51.084
We'll schedule
a conference for...

02:51.117 --> 02:51.785
I pass.

02:52.886 --> 02:54.621
I'm not giving you that option.

02:54.655 --> 02:56.557
Jon Macklin is a racist.

02:56.590 --> 02:58.458
Also a defendant.

02:58.491 --> 03:00.767
YOUNG:
And a white supremacist.
The victim was black.

03:03.236 --> 03:04.137
Is that why you picked me,

03:04.170 --> 03:05.105
because I'm black?

03:05.138 --> 03:07.508
I picked you because
his current lawyer

03:07.541 --> 03:08.842
is over his head,

03:08.875 --> 03:10.476
and you're one of the best
criminal defense attorneys

03:10.511 --> 03:12.245
I know.

03:12.278 --> 03:13.279
And you're black.

03:15.348 --> 03:17.350
Mr. Macklin asked for you
by name.

03:19.485 --> 03:20.521
He asked for me?

03:21.354 --> 03:23.223
I don't much like
being the judge on this any more

03:23.256 --> 03:24.925
than you enjoy
being the attorney.

03:24.958 --> 03:27.427
Let's just give him
the fairest trial we can

03:27.460 --> 03:30.531
and eliminate at least one
possible grounds for appeal.

03:34.868 --> 03:36.036
Your Honor sounds biased.

03:36.870 --> 03:38.505
Your Honor will remain impartial

03:38.539 --> 03:40.440
and guarantee the defendant
a fair trial.

03:42.576 --> 03:44.645
Speaking personally,
I hate the bastard.

03:47.648 --> 03:48.515
Meet your new client,

03:48.549 --> 03:49.650
and let's get going.

03:52.719 --> 03:57.658
(music playing)

04:33.133 --> 04:34.067
You took the case?

04:34.100 --> 04:35.234
I was ordered to take it.

04:35.268 --> 04:36.870
It's not like I had a choice.

04:36.903 --> 04:37.771
Jimmy, I want you with me.

04:37.804 --> 04:39.372
No, no, no.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.174
YOUNG: Ellenor, can you
cover for me on Roland Huff?

04:41.207 --> 04:42.408
Actually, I can't. I have--

04:42.442 --> 04:44.244
Alan, get the file from Tara.

04:44.277 --> 04:45.411
If you need help, get it.

04:45.445 --> 04:46.212
This is a murder case.

04:46.246 --> 04:48.214
Jimmy, let's go.

04:48.915 --> 04:50.316
If I need help...

04:50.350 --> 04:52.018
WILSON: Jamie,
Melissa Kenner.

04:52.052 --> 04:53.119
STRINGER:
Who is Melissa Kenner?

04:53.153 --> 04:55.421
You inherited her
from Rebecca Washington.

04:55.455 --> 04:56.557
She's been on your schedule.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.091
Oh, that.
Where is she now?

04:58.124 --> 04:59.626
I put her in Eugene's office.

04:59.660 --> 05:02.035
SHORE: Tara, I'll need the file
on Roland Huff please.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.069
Why?

05:03.870 --> 05:05.471
Why? Because I'm now
handling it.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.074
Is that a problem?

05:08.875 --> 05:09.976
I'll get the file.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.345
SHORE: I'm assuming
it won't be a problem.

05:13.146 --> 05:13.914
We're both adults.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.116
We should be able to...

05:16.149 --> 05:18.118
suppress our respective urges.

05:18.151 --> 05:18.919
Would I be wrong?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.656
I find an urge
to be much like a thirst.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.091
Suppression is best achieved
by quenching.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.492
Hmm.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.095
(chuckles)

05:29.129 --> 05:30.564
You'll bring me the file
personally?

05:32.899 --> 05:34.367
Would you like it personally?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.843
We were on our way to Kingston

05:42.876 --> 05:44.344
to see my parents.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.079
Amanda's never met
her grandparents.

05:46.112 --> 05:47.480
Amanda's your daughter?

05:48.515 --> 05:50.483
Ms. Washington didn't tell you
any of this?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.152
Uh, well, she did,

05:52.185 --> 05:53.820
but it was a while ago,

05:53.854 --> 05:55.789
and I should get it
from you anyhow.

05:55.822 --> 05:56.489
KENNER: Okay.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.626
Well, we had just boarded
here at Logan.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.367
I'd been on the plane
maybe 10 minutes

06:01.401 --> 06:03.436
when suddenly
airport security comes

06:03.469 --> 06:04.838
and tells me I have to get off.

06:04.871 --> 06:05.706
Why?

06:06.540 --> 06:08.809
Because I was too fat to fly.

06:10.143 --> 06:11.678
Rebecca didn't tell you
that part?

06:11.712 --> 06:13.213
Oh, she did. She did.

06:13.246 --> 06:15.716
Uh, who, specifically,

06:15.749 --> 06:16.550
asked you to leave?

06:16.583 --> 06:18.585
The flight attendant.

06:18.619 --> 06:20.721
I was encroaching.

06:21.087 --> 06:22.789
That's the word she used.

06:22.823 --> 06:25.158
She said I was invading
the seat next to me.

06:25.191 --> 06:26.126
The flight was full.

06:26.159 --> 06:27.360
They needed the space.

06:27.393 --> 06:30.063
Voices got raised.

06:30.096 --> 06:31.364
It was awful.

06:31.397 --> 06:34.134
And this happened in front
of the other passengers?

06:34.167 --> 06:36.102
Never mind other people.

06:36.136 --> 06:37.504
In front of my daughter.

06:38.404 --> 06:40.273
And then people started yelling

06:40.306 --> 06:41.608
for me to get off.

06:41.642 --> 06:42.909
I paid for my ticket

06:42.943 --> 06:44.878
like everyone else.

06:44.911 --> 06:47.413
I told her
I wasn't going anywhere.

06:47.447 --> 06:49.983
So they had security
drag me out.

06:51.685 --> 06:53.486
You were physically removed?

06:55.388 --> 06:56.690
You don't know my case at all.

06:56.723 --> 06:58.559
No. I do. But...
KENNER: Ms. Washington

06:58.592 --> 07:00.200
barely returned my calls.

07:00.233 --> 07:01.568
Then she fobs it off on you.

07:01.602 --> 07:03.336
And now you don't know
the first thing about it.

07:03.704 --> 07:04.805
I should make a complaint.

07:04.838 --> 07:06.339
That's what I should do.
Melissa...

07:06.372 --> 07:09.042
It's not like I'm asking
for much, just my fare back,

07:09.075 --> 07:10.677
plus maybe a little something.

07:10.711 --> 07:12.546
But you people
can't be bothered, can you?

07:12.579 --> 07:15.215
Melissa, I'm on the case, okay?

07:24.791 --> 07:27.728
(music playing)

07:47.447 --> 07:48.481
Jon Macklin?

07:48.515 --> 07:50.617
Jonathan.

07:50.651 --> 07:51.785
Thank you for coming.

07:52.619 --> 07:53.587
This is James Berluti.

07:53.620 --> 07:54.454
He works with me.

07:54.487 --> 07:56.256
Well, thank you both so much

07:56.289 --> 07:57.724
for taking my case.

07:57.758 --> 07:59.660
We were ordered to.

08:00.300 --> 08:03.036
Yes, well,
I understand your reluctance.

08:05.906 --> 08:06.807
Please sit.

08:17.217 --> 08:19.052
You're aware
that the prosecution intends

08:19.085 --> 08:21.021
to paint me
as a racial extremist?

08:22.222 --> 08:24.991
By hiring you,
I hope to undercut

08:25.025 --> 08:25.926
that assertion.

08:26.359 --> 08:27.828
As accurate as that may be.

08:30.330 --> 08:33.166
I'm an educator, Mr. Young,
nothing more.

08:33.198 --> 08:34.868
My mission is to help people

08:34.900 --> 08:35.936
to improve their lives.

08:35.969 --> 08:37.169
White people.

08:37.703 --> 08:38.972
Yes.

08:39.005 --> 08:40.006
My people.

08:41.942 --> 08:43.977
I run a youth outreach program

08:44.010 --> 08:45.679
to help troubled teens.

08:45.712 --> 08:47.848
I help the unemployed
reverse their misfortune.

08:47.881 --> 08:49.550
My church exists, you see,

08:49.583 --> 08:51.652
to aid the disenfranchised.

08:51.685 --> 08:53.887
To restore to them
what is rightfully theirs.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.489
BERLUTI: Even if it means
committing murder to do it.

09:01.868 --> 09:04.270
I am not involved
in any murder,

09:04.304 --> 09:06.607
Mr. Berluti.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.875
I would encourage you
to study my teachings.

09:10.376 --> 09:12.546
I'm not a violent man.

09:13.747 --> 09:15.749
The shooter says
you ordered him to kill.

09:16.316 --> 09:17.718
The shooter,

09:17.751 --> 09:19.319
Mr. Daniel Grant,

09:19.352 --> 09:22.088
came to us as a runaway.

09:22.122 --> 09:23.857
We gave him work,

09:23.890 --> 09:25.191
a sense of purpose.

09:26.092 --> 09:28.228
Now, evidently,
he's finding some purpose

09:28.261 --> 09:29.730
in implicating me in a crime

09:29.763 --> 09:30.831
I had no part of.

09:31.632 --> 09:33.199
His motive being?

09:33.233 --> 09:35.368
Well, I have many enemies,
Mr. Young.

09:35.969 --> 09:37.403
The FBI taps my phone.

09:37.938 --> 09:40.306
State police track
my people everywhere.

09:40.340 --> 09:42.876
My beliefs
have made me a target.

09:42.909 --> 09:44.511
And I think I've been set up.

09:45.411 --> 09:46.580
They couldn't get
to me legally,

09:46.613 --> 09:48.148
so they've done it illegally,

09:48.181 --> 09:49.816
using Mr. Grant.

09:52.819 --> 09:54.420
Now, you can believe
what you want to about me,

09:54.454 --> 09:56.590
Mr. Young,

09:56.623 --> 09:58.358
but if you look at the evidence,

09:59.760 --> 10:02.402
you won't believe
that I committed this crime.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.607
I'm asking for your help.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.510
Will you help me?

10:14.581 --> 10:16.517
Is there a reason
all of Rebecca's cases

10:16.550 --> 10:18.151
have been dumped on me?

10:18.184 --> 10:20.521
First of all, they didn't all
get dumped on you.

10:20.554 --> 10:21.788
Yes?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.857
Uh, no, I'm waiting
for Mr. Ashford.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.158
Is there a reason
I have to place

10:25.191 --> 10:26.059
all my own calls?

10:26.092 --> 10:27.193
Does Tara not work here?

10:27.561 --> 10:29.696
She's meeting with Roland.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.598
And for what it's worth,
the case you refer to

10:31.632 --> 10:33.534
as being dumped on you
sounds like a good one.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.370
Jamie, the airline
just threw her off

10:37.403 --> 10:38.338
with her daughter.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.541
Yes? Uh, Mr. Ashford,

10:40.574 --> 10:41.808
my name is Jamie Stringer.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.578
I represent Melissa Kenner.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.946
Kenner.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.948
Melissa--no.
My name is Jamie.

10:53.587 --> 10:54.788
Roland, I want you
to tell me

10:54.821 --> 10:55.722
everything that happened.

10:57.023 --> 10:57.891
You entered the house,

10:59.059 --> 10:59.726
then what?

11:01.835 --> 11:02.703
One second.

11:06.239 --> 11:08.374
Is that wise?

11:08.408 --> 11:10.276
Whatever he tells us,
we're stuck with.

11:10.310 --> 11:12.345
Suppose we should want
to argue the elements.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.048
Better for him
not to tell us?

11:16.950 --> 11:18.418
That may be true, but...

11:20.954 --> 11:23.724
I'm dying to know,
aren't you?

11:23.757 --> 11:24.958
Okay. Look--

11:24.991 --> 11:27.728
We're arguing insanity.

11:27.761 --> 11:29.495
For that, we need, uh--

11:32.533 --> 11:35.001
we need to know
what happened...

11:35.035 --> 11:36.136
exactly.

11:39.339 --> 11:40.406
Sorry to keep you waiting.

11:41.274 --> 11:43.510
Now, you came through the door,

11:45.445 --> 11:46.479
then what?

11:47.113 --> 11:48.815
Well, I heard this sound,

11:48.849 --> 11:49.983
the same sound.

11:50.483 --> 11:51.685
Which sound was that?

11:52.519 --> 11:55.355
ROLAND: Well, the bed.

11:55.388 --> 11:56.623
Uh, I knew what they were doing,

11:56.657 --> 11:58.859
so I went up there.

12:02.335 --> 12:05.038
This time they didn't see me
at first.

12:05.071 --> 12:06.840
They just kept going.

12:08.609 --> 12:09.710
And then I saw her look.

12:12.478 --> 12:14.147
She looked at me

12:14.180 --> 12:15.649
like she expected me

12:15.682 --> 12:17.150
to walk in on them,

12:17.183 --> 12:19.986
and she was doing it all
for my benefit.

12:20.721 --> 12:23.557
She had this look in her eye,

12:23.590 --> 12:25.325
till she saw the gun.

12:25.358 --> 12:27.861
Then I can't remember
what happened.

12:29.429 --> 12:30.831
They started saying something,

12:30.864 --> 12:32.633
but I couldn't hear it.

12:33.366 --> 12:34.901
Their mouths were moving,

12:34.935 --> 12:37.437
but I don't remember
hearing anything.

12:37.470 --> 12:39.339
I just kept seeing
the look in her eye

12:39.372 --> 12:40.473
when she saw me,

12:41.942 --> 12:43.910
watching me watch her.

12:44.745 --> 12:46.046
Then I guess...

12:48.515 --> 12:49.950
I shot the gun,

12:49.983 --> 12:52.185
twice.

12:52.218 --> 12:53.987
Then the bed stopped squeaking.

12:56.557 --> 12:57.891
Everything stopped.

13:02.969 --> 13:04.337
May I ask?

13:04.370 --> 13:05.739
Where did the gun come from?

13:07.373 --> 13:08.942
I kept it locked in a den.

13:11.111 --> 13:13.379
When I heard the bed,
I knew,

13:14.080 --> 13:15.281
and I grabbed it.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.519
I loved her too much,
I guess.

13:21.021 --> 13:22.422
I had to shoot her.

13:37.370 --> 13:38.639
STRINGER: Look,
I don't think your client

13:38.672 --> 13:40.406
really wants the publicity.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.075
Big airline physically removes

13:42.108 --> 13:43.309
a peaceful passenger,

13:43.343 --> 13:45.078
who paid her fare,

13:45.111 --> 13:46.379
because she's fat.

13:46.412 --> 13:47.748
Well, I could argue
the merits.

13:47.781 --> 13:49.082
You have them?

13:49.115 --> 13:50.416
Actually, yes.

13:50.884 --> 13:52.085
She was...

13:52.118 --> 13:54.655
taking up another
passenger's seat,

13:54.688 --> 13:56.489
a passenger
who was also peaceful

13:56.523 --> 13:58.759
and had also paid full fare.

13:58.792 --> 14:01.568
The reason my client
was encroaching

14:01.602 --> 14:02.769
probably had more
to do with you

14:02.803 --> 14:03.737
making the seats smaller

14:03.770 --> 14:04.938
to serve the bottom line.

14:04.971 --> 14:06.039
Well, as I said,

14:06.072 --> 14:08.274
we could argue the merits.

14:08.308 --> 14:10.777
But since you bring up
the bottom line, Ms. Stringer,

14:10.811 --> 14:11.945
why don't we just get to that?

14:11.978 --> 14:13.113
Fine.

14:13.146 --> 14:15.481
You missed
your filing deadline.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.351
What?
The statute of limitations

14:18.384 --> 14:20.086
for suing us has expired.

14:25.425 --> 14:27.060
Our claim
would be emotional distress.

14:27.093 --> 14:28.962
For that,
we have three years to file.

14:28.995 --> 14:30.430
In Massachusetts,

14:30.463 --> 14:32.198
but your client
was on an international flight.

14:32.232 --> 14:33.934
That means it was governed
by the rules

14:33.967 --> 14:35.969
of the Warsaw Convention.

14:36.002 --> 14:37.103
You had two years,

14:37.137 --> 14:39.740
which were up last month.

14:40.607 --> 14:43.343
I, I really should report
this oversight to the bar,

14:43.376 --> 14:44.811
truth be told.

14:46.847 --> 14:49.182
But you seem like a...

14:49.215 --> 14:51.918
conscientious young woman.

14:51.952 --> 14:54.020
I'm going to pretend
we never had this meeting.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.236
Tara, we missed
the deadline.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.071
The what?
The filing deadline.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.373
The statute of limitations
tolled on the airline case.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.742
We can't sue.

15:08.775 --> 15:09.676
Well, why didn't
anyone tell me?

15:09.710 --> 15:10.711
Slow down.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.378
Did Rebecca never file
a complaint?

15:12.412 --> 15:13.647
I was brought
into this late, Jamie.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.381
I don't...
SHORE: What's going on?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.684
This is private.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.419
Well, it sounds
like a crisis.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.521
I so enjoy that.

15:20.554 --> 15:22.623
Alan, Jamie said
this is private.

15:28.829 --> 15:29.863
What am I going to do?

15:29.896 --> 15:31.231
The first thing,

15:31.264 --> 15:31.965
you're not going to panic.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.099
This case is dead.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.400
I missed a deadline.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.902
It's malpractice.
Calm.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.439
Are we calm?

15:39.472 --> 15:40.273
Let's talk to Eugene.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.207
No.
Jamie.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.242
STRINGER: No.
He is the last person

15:42.275 --> 15:43.109
I want to know about this.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.711
We're not being calm.

15:50.551 --> 15:51.217
What's up?

15:52.085 --> 15:53.787
What's up is our man
may be innocent.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.188
What?

15:55.221 --> 15:57.457
I say "may".

15:57.490 --> 15:59.092
The case is circumstantial,
Jimmy, uh,

15:59.125 --> 16:01.568
but I've been going through
all his published articles,

16:01.602 --> 16:03.136
and he's right,

16:03.169 --> 16:04.705
none of them advocates violence.

16:04.738 --> 16:07.307
Why would the kid say
he was ordered if...

16:07.340 --> 16:08.174
I don't know.

16:08.208 --> 16:09.142
Maybe to cut a deal.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.146
I want you to talk to him.
The shooter?

16:13.179 --> 16:14.548
Well, he's been talking
to the press.

16:14.581 --> 16:15.448
His lawyer can't stop him.

16:15.481 --> 16:16.550
He might speak to you.

16:17.751 --> 16:19.986
I'm going to continue
going through Macklin's papers.

16:20.554 --> 16:22.989
You really think
he could be innocent?

16:25.458 --> 16:26.727
Talk to the shooter.

16:28.662 --> 16:29.930
SHORE: She just seemed
so upset.

16:29.963 --> 16:31.064
Maybe I can help.

16:31.097 --> 16:32.498
It's private, Alan.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.934
I'm sorry.
Come on.

16:33.967 --> 16:35.468
Throw me a bone.
I'll throw you one.

16:36.570 --> 16:37.604
Where are you going anyway?

16:37.638 --> 16:39.272
Off to see Roland.
He wasn't looking so good.

16:39.305 --> 16:42.275
Whoa, you're not going
to visit Roland.

16:42.308 --> 16:43.343
Uh, he was coming unraveled.

16:43.376 --> 16:44.645
Did you not see that?
I did.

16:45.712 --> 16:47.514
And unraveled is in
his best legal interests.

16:48.615 --> 16:50.784
He's meeting with
the court's psychologist today,

16:50.817 --> 16:53.486
who hopefully will find
some diminished capacity.

16:55.021 --> 16:56.590
Let's talk about Jamie.

16:57.924 --> 17:00.466
Might it occur to you
that I could help her?

17:05.038 --> 17:06.540
She missed a filing deadline.

17:07.406 --> 17:08.174
Big case?

17:09.075 --> 17:11.011
Not terribly,

17:11.044 --> 17:13.680
but if you were to ask
the client--

17:13.714 --> 17:15.181
any suggestions?

17:15.781 --> 17:18.018
Well, not that Jamie
would ever do such a thing,

17:18.050 --> 17:19.685
but if it were me,

17:19.720 --> 17:21.521
I would just tell the client
that we settled,

17:21.555 --> 17:22.689
pay them out of my own pocket,

17:22.723 --> 17:24.991
and avoid
the whole malpractice thing.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.227
That's fraud, Alan.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.229
I said, "If it were me."

17:30.296 --> 17:32.933
Is there anything
that you wouldn't do?

17:32.966 --> 17:34.400
For example?

17:40.173 --> 17:41.374
Alan, what are you doing?

17:41.842 --> 17:44.277
I was only trying to bed Tara.

17:44.310 --> 17:45.411
I promise.

17:51.952 --> 17:53.920
GRANT: Mr. Macklin
saved my life.

17:53.954 --> 17:56.256
I would never betray him,
Mr. Berluti.

17:56.289 --> 17:58.258
But, see, you're saying

17:58.291 --> 17:59.926
he ordered you to kill a guy.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.135
GRANT: Well, first,
that's what happened.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.804
And, second, I don't...
He claims he never told you

18:03.837 --> 18:04.905
to execute anybody.

18:05.739 --> 18:07.207
Mr. Macklin is a man

18:07.240 --> 18:08.509
of great principle.

18:09.075 --> 18:11.712
He's a man
who is profoundly honest.

18:11.745 --> 18:14.214
And I believe,
on a fundamental level,

18:14.247 --> 18:17.183
he's taking pride
in my truthfulness.

18:17.217 --> 18:19.853
That having been said,
it would be understandable

18:19.886 --> 18:20.721
for him to be fearful

18:20.754 --> 18:23.023
during this very trying ordeal.

18:23.489 --> 18:24.658
You are saying

18:24.691 --> 18:27.661
this profoundly honest man

18:27.694 --> 18:28.762
is lying?

18:30.263 --> 18:31.965
I think we need to pray for him.

18:33.800 --> 18:34.935
Pray for him?

18:35.836 --> 18:38.238
Mr. Berluti, uh, I would agree.

18:38.271 --> 18:40.907
Mr. Macklin's teachings
have never called for murder.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.376
Perhaps, consumed by anger,

18:43.409 --> 18:44.778
he became lost.

18:46.112 --> 18:48.081
But I have always been
very clear,

18:48.114 --> 18:50.083
specifically in
my devotion to him.

18:50.116 --> 18:52.485
I've never wavered.

18:52.519 --> 18:54.354
I killed Arnold Coleman

18:54.387 --> 18:56.322
because Mr. Macklin told me to.

19:00.133 --> 19:02.035
Out of my own pocket?

19:02.068 --> 19:03.637
I'm not advising it.

19:03.670 --> 19:06.472
It's just something
that Alan sort of proposed.

19:06.507 --> 19:07.974
Jamie, this is malpractice,

19:08.008 --> 19:09.743
black-and-white.

19:09.776 --> 19:11.612
You missed a filing deadline.

19:11.645 --> 19:13.479
Sometimes judges forgive
late filings,

19:13.514 --> 19:15.081
and I'm not going to cover up

19:15.115 --> 19:16.583
one offense with another.

19:16.617 --> 19:17.684
Are you kidding?

19:17.718 --> 19:19.520
WILSON: As I said,
I'm not advising it.

19:21.487 --> 19:22.288
Is she in there?

19:23.356 --> 19:24.925
With a snarl on her face.

19:32.933 --> 19:33.934
Melissa, hey.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.036
KENNER: This is my daughter,
Amanda.

19:36.570 --> 19:38.038
Hi, Amanda.
Hi.

19:38.071 --> 19:39.339
KENNER: I was thinking,

19:39.372 --> 19:41.542
since she got thrown off
the plane too,

19:41.575 --> 19:43.510
maybe we could amend
our complaint

19:43.544 --> 19:44.811
and add her

19:44.845 --> 19:46.112
for extra sympathy.

19:46.747 --> 19:49.249
Uh, that's, uh--

19:52.118 --> 19:53.854
Melissa, I have something
to tell you.

19:53.887 --> 19:55.021
What?

19:56.056 --> 19:57.724
For some, uh...

19:59.425 --> 20:00.967
well, sometimes...

20:04.905 --> 20:06.840
what I'm trying to say...

20:06.873 --> 20:08.542
is that, incredibly,

20:12.412 --> 20:13.313
the defendant

20:13.346 --> 20:14.915
has offered to settle.

20:15.616 --> 20:16.316
They have?

20:16.349 --> 20:17.417
Yes.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.753
They are going to refund
your full fare.

20:19.786 --> 20:20.621
Yours too, Amanda.

20:20.654 --> 20:23.023
And get this--
this is the best part.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.525
They've agreed to pay you

20:24.558 --> 20:26.459
$10,000.

20:27.027 --> 20:28.261
What?
Yes.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.130
I met with them, I got tough,

20:30.163 --> 20:31.197
and they just folded.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.933
It's fantastic.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.968
Oh, my God.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.269
Oh, my God.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.372
Tell them no.

20:40.941 --> 20:42.609
What?
I've thought about it.

20:42.643 --> 20:44.678
What they did
can't be fixed with money.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.713
Melissa, everything
can be fixed with money.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.181
I want my day in court.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.883
Your day? Whoa. Hold on.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.417
I want to put the word out.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.620
We could lose in court.

20:53.654 --> 20:55.355
I think you should take
the money, don't you, Amanda?

20:55.388 --> 20:56.823
KENNER: My mind is made up.

20:56.857 --> 20:57.958
STRINGER: Okay. Okay.

20:57.991 --> 21:00.601
Clients sometimes let emotion
govern their decisions.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.369
It's my job to step in
as objective...

21:03.403 --> 21:04.137
I'm not...

21:04.170 --> 21:05.606
Okay. Take the money.

21:07.708 --> 21:08.842
She's yelling at us.

21:11.411 --> 21:12.478
I just--

21:14.915 --> 21:16.717
I just want you to be happy.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.386
I want my day in court.

21:20.420 --> 21:21.688
If they're offering $10,000,

21:21.722 --> 21:23.423
there's got to be more.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.992
The way they treated me,

21:26.026 --> 21:27.528
we're going to trial.

21:35.936 --> 21:37.437
The news isn't good, Roland.

21:37.470 --> 21:40.040
ROLAND: What's the matter?
Well, the state psychologist

21:40.073 --> 21:42.208
finds you competent
to stand trial,

21:42.242 --> 21:43.510
which we anticipated.

21:43.544 --> 21:46.079
But, moreover,
in his judgment,

21:46.112 --> 21:49.049
you fully understood
the nature and quality

21:49.082 --> 21:50.450
of your actions.

21:50.483 --> 21:51.652
Basically...

21:51.685 --> 21:53.887
he won't support
our insanity defense.

21:54.788 --> 21:55.989
Did you expect him to?

21:56.022 --> 21:57.090
SHORE: Well, I was hopeful.

21:57.123 --> 22:00.100
Now, listen,
I've hired our own expert.

22:00.133 --> 22:02.102
Very expensive,
highly pedigreed.

22:02.135 --> 22:05.205
He could be an enormous part
of our case.

22:05.238 --> 22:07.340
It's important
when you meet with him

22:07.373 --> 22:08.542
to act nutty.

22:08.575 --> 22:09.576
Alan.

22:09.610 --> 22:11.277
SHORE: I'm certainly
not suborning

22:11.311 --> 22:13.479
false testimony
or demeanor.

22:13.514 --> 22:14.447
Be yourself,

22:14.480 --> 22:18.384
but that little
fist-tapping thing you do,

22:18.418 --> 22:19.586
do that.
Alan.

22:19.620 --> 22:22.823
SHORE: Also, the part
where mouths were moving

22:22.856 --> 22:24.925
but you didn't hear words
coming out,

22:24.958 --> 22:26.492
be sure to include that.

22:26.527 --> 22:28.662
And, if true, of course,

22:28.695 --> 22:30.263
don't forget to mention

22:30.296 --> 22:33.133
you have no memory
of squeezing a trigger.

22:36.737 --> 22:40.674
You're a lovely,
sweet man, Roland,

22:40.707 --> 22:44.110
but our whole case rests

22:44.144 --> 22:46.680
on you coming off as a loon.

22:54.855 --> 22:56.757
Now, I have a duty
to report you.

22:56.790 --> 22:59.292
I prefaced everything
with "if true".

22:59.325 --> 23:02.002
You just coached a witness
to act crazy.

23:02.035 --> 23:03.436
Nonsense.
I said, "Be yourself."

23:03.469 --> 23:04.304
Alan.

23:04.337 --> 23:05.271
Tara.

23:06.573 --> 23:08.341
Did you hear the part
about "sweet, lovely man"?

23:08.374 --> 23:09.042
That's true.

23:10.010 --> 23:11.244
Do you want
that sweet, lovely man

23:11.277 --> 23:12.646
to go to prison
for the rest of his life?

23:12.679 --> 23:15.048
I'm not talking
about observation in a hospital

23:15.081 --> 23:15.816
until he's cured.

23:15.849 --> 23:17.651
I'm talking about prison

23:17.684 --> 23:19.686
for the rest of his life.

23:19.720 --> 23:20.887
That's not what this is about.

23:20.921 --> 23:21.955
I'm talking--
That's exactly what it's about.

23:21.988 --> 23:23.557
That's what it's always about.

23:24.958 --> 23:28.194
You're not here
to serve a process

23:28.228 --> 23:30.096
or an adversarial system

23:30.130 --> 23:32.465
second to none in the world.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.634
If you're lucky,

23:34.835 --> 23:36.102
you'll have the opportunity,

23:36.136 --> 23:38.672
every once in a great while,

23:38.705 --> 23:40.941
to defend a decent human being

23:40.974 --> 23:44.077
who really doesn't belong
in prison.

23:44.110 --> 23:45.612
You've got one here.

23:47.514 --> 23:49.750
You know what you do
in those situations, Tara?

23:49.783 --> 23:51.518
Whatever you can.

23:52.953 --> 23:55.421
Nothing more, but nothing less.

24:06.472 --> 24:07.373
FRUTT: You lied to her?

24:07.407 --> 24:08.675
Yes.

24:08.709 --> 24:09.776
And she turned down the offer.

24:09.810 --> 24:11.177
And now she wants
to go to trial,

24:11.211 --> 24:13.580
and I don't know what to do.

24:13.614 --> 24:14.781
Jamie, how did...

24:14.815 --> 24:16.182
I know it was stupid,
but I--

24:16.216 --> 24:17.450
FRUTT: Oh, my God.

24:17.483 --> 24:19.452
So this woman
thinks the airline

24:19.485 --> 24:21.555
offered her $10,000?

24:21.588 --> 24:22.789
When we're barred
from even suing,

24:22.823 --> 24:24.357
because I missed
the stupid deadline.

24:24.390 --> 24:25.626
This is Rebecca's fault.

24:25.659 --> 24:26.693
No, it's yours,

24:26.727 --> 24:29.262
and one you've
compounded unbelievably.

24:29.295 --> 24:30.997
Look, just help me.

24:31.031 --> 24:31.898
Can you do that?

24:31.932 --> 24:33.333
I'm not really sure how.

24:35.035 --> 24:36.803
I think we have to tell Eugene.

24:36.837 --> 24:39.405
No. I cannot look at myself
through his judgmental,

24:39.439 --> 24:41.307
unforgiving, intolerant,
vicious eyes.

24:41.341 --> 24:42.142
Forget it.

24:42.175 --> 24:43.910
This, the man you sleep with?

24:44.377 --> 24:46.012
I've come to you...

24:47.180 --> 24:47.948
not him.

24:50.684 --> 24:51.918
Please.

24:54.420 --> 24:56.990
Okay. First...

24:57.023 --> 24:59.526
we all commit and get sued
for malpractice.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.301
It's why we have insurance.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.303
Uh, I've only been out
of law school for two years.

25:03.336 --> 25:04.538
Uh, I didn't want it
on my record.

25:04.571 --> 25:06.940
It would be the only thing
on my record.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.675
Second, to lie to a client--

25:08.709 --> 25:10.010
I know. I didn't plan it.

25:10.043 --> 25:11.344
It just came out.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.547
FRUTT: Well, Jamie,
the only thing you can do now

25:13.580 --> 25:14.615
is correct it.

25:14.648 --> 25:16.750
Tell your client the truth.

25:16.783 --> 25:19.920
Ellenor, she was ready
to call the bar on me before.

25:19.953 --> 25:23.089
This woman will hold
a press conference.

25:23.123 --> 25:23.924
Trust me.

25:23.957 --> 25:26.026
When she feels wronged--

25:26.059 --> 25:28.094
that's why
I'm in this trouble.

25:30.230 --> 25:32.899
Can you please talk to her

25:32.933 --> 25:35.068
and convince her
it's in her best interest

25:35.101 --> 25:36.870
to take the $10,000?

25:38.271 --> 25:39.773
No.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.041
I can't do that.

25:44.678 --> 25:46.513
I could lose my license
over this.

25:47.581 --> 25:49.182
If she makes a thing about--

25:53.319 --> 25:54.821
I could get disbarred.

25:57.257 --> 25:58.725
Jamie...

25:58.759 --> 26:00.734
you have made
a horrible mistake.

26:01.835 --> 26:04.938
The best advice I can give you

26:04.971 --> 26:06.472
is don't make it worse.

26:12.412 --> 26:14.247
GRANT: Once he got a hold
of the building,

26:14.280 --> 26:16.817
he immediately moved
to evict Mr. Macklin.

26:16.850 --> 26:19.352
We're talking now
about the man you shot?

26:19.385 --> 26:20.821
Yes.

26:20.854 --> 26:22.188
Mr. Macklin had gone to court

26:22.222 --> 26:23.990
to oppose the eviction.

26:24.024 --> 26:25.391
And upon suffering defeat,

26:25.425 --> 26:28.461
a very public defeat,

26:28.494 --> 26:30.363
that's when he told me
of my mission.

26:30.396 --> 26:31.431
BERLUTI: Okay.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.734
You used the word "mission",

26:33.767 --> 26:35.168
did Mr. Macklin ever use

26:35.201 --> 26:37.938
the word "kill" or "execute"?

26:37.971 --> 26:39.773
He used the word "eliminate".

26:39.806 --> 26:42.543
He said my mission
was to eliminate Mr. Coleman.

26:43.043 --> 26:44.177
Did you question it?

26:45.812 --> 26:47.313
Did you say, "Hey, hold on.

26:47.347 --> 26:49.182
That's murder.
We don't do that"?

26:50.150 --> 26:51.084
No.

26:51.585 --> 26:52.586
Why not?

26:52.619 --> 26:53.687
Because, as I said,

26:53.720 --> 26:55.355
it was a mission,
Mr. Berluti.

26:55.388 --> 26:57.758
Well, suppose Mr. Macklin said

26:57.791 --> 26:59.560
it was your mission

26:59.593 --> 27:00.967
to kill your own mother?

27:01.334 --> 27:02.636
He would never say that.

27:03.704 --> 27:04.605
Why not?

27:05.972 --> 27:07.908
He had a great love for me,

27:07.941 --> 27:10.110
and still does I believe,

27:10.143 --> 27:13.313
just as I continue
to have great love for him.

27:20.020 --> 27:20.721
A gay thing?

27:20.754 --> 27:21.788
I'm telling you.

27:21.822 --> 27:24.057
Not everything's
a gay thing, Jimmy.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.459
Don't make me out
a homophobe, Eugene.

27:26.492 --> 27:28.194
I'm telling you.

27:28.228 --> 27:29.563
Let's just ask him.

27:37.203 --> 27:39.573
Do you need time
to think it over?

27:40.140 --> 27:43.810
No, I do not, Mr. Berluti.

27:43.844 --> 27:46.947
My silence is meant
to connote offense.

27:47.848 --> 27:49.816
Homosexuality is against God.

27:49.850 --> 27:51.017
It is evil.

27:51.051 --> 27:52.586
Is it possible this boy

27:52.619 --> 27:54.454
has homosexual feelings
towards you?

27:54.487 --> 27:56.990
No. That is not possible.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.124
Who is telling you this?

27:58.792 --> 28:00.534
I just detected.

28:01.735 --> 28:05.205
Danny Grant
is kind of effeminate.

28:05.238 --> 28:08.374
He speaks of you
with great...

28:08.408 --> 28:09.309
affection.

28:10.276 --> 28:12.445
Danny Grant is a loyal member

28:12.478 --> 28:15.015
of my church
who became misguided.

28:15.682 --> 28:17.784
He acted unilaterally.

28:17.818 --> 28:19.986
I'm sure he did so
under the false assumption

28:20.020 --> 28:23.423
that he was serving me
or my church.

28:23.456 --> 28:25.859
He's neither expressed
nor manifested

28:25.892 --> 28:29.362
any evil homosexual intentions.

28:32.933 --> 28:34.367
Look...

28:34.400 --> 28:36.136
this could be something
to go with.

28:36.737 --> 28:39.072
The victim defeated you
publicly in court.

28:39.105 --> 28:40.707
The boy was in love
with you,

28:40.741 --> 28:42.709
so he avenges your loss.

28:42.743 --> 28:45.812
Then maybe
feeling rejected by you,

28:45.846 --> 28:48.014
he decides to say
you ordered the hit.

28:48.048 --> 28:51.117
There's no homosexuality
in my church, Mr. Young.

28:52.218 --> 28:54.387
If you suggest as much,

28:54.420 --> 28:56.757
I will discharge you.

29:01.868 --> 29:03.269
Was he enraged? Yes.

29:03.303 --> 29:04.805
Heat of passion? Certainly.

29:04.838 --> 29:05.672
But insane?

29:05.706 --> 29:06.573
I don't think so.

29:06.607 --> 29:07.808
SHORE:
Did he tell you the part

29:07.841 --> 29:09.175
about seeing mouths move

29:09.209 --> 29:10.744
and not hearing words come out?

29:10.777 --> 29:12.012
Yes. And he tapped his fists

29:12.045 --> 29:13.947
per your instructions.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.716
Look, your problem goes
to everything

29:15.749 --> 29:18.652
that transpired before he went
into the bedroom.

29:18.685 --> 29:20.186
He says he knew
what was going on

29:20.220 --> 29:21.454
when he retrieved the weapon.

29:21.487 --> 29:22.789
He likely formed intent

29:22.823 --> 29:24.525
down in his den.
Did he say that?

29:24.558 --> 29:26.192
Well, why else would he get
the gun? To clean it?

29:26.226 --> 29:27.728
What are you, a profiler, now?

29:27.761 --> 29:29.362
No. I'm a psychologist

29:29.395 --> 29:30.597
who is on your side,

29:30.631 --> 29:34.467
and I am advising you
not to go with insanity.

29:35.636 --> 29:36.703
WILSON: What about automatism?

29:38.772 --> 29:40.340
Isn't it possible
that he got the gun

29:40.373 --> 29:41.575
to scare them,

29:41.608 --> 29:44.578
to threaten them,
maybe even shoot them,

29:44.611 --> 29:45.779
but once he went into the room

29:45.812 --> 29:48.782
and he saw his best friend
screwing his wife,

29:48.815 --> 29:50.283
everything after that
was involuntary?

29:51.885 --> 29:54.287
MAN: So you're saying he
retrieved the gun downstairs...

29:54.320 --> 29:56.056
I'm saying that even if he had
a general intent

29:56.089 --> 29:57.924
to assault or kill
when he was downstairs,

29:57.958 --> 29:59.593
that once he went into the room

29:59.626 --> 30:00.701
and he saw what he saw,

30:02.669 --> 30:04.470
he then went on automatic pilot.

30:04.505 --> 30:06.172
Isn't that possible?

30:09.676 --> 30:11.612
Well...

30:11.645 --> 30:13.279
I suppose...
That's what happened.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.415
I can feel it in my heart.

30:15.448 --> 30:18.719
That's precisely
what happened.

30:18.752 --> 30:19.653
Wonderful.

30:19.686 --> 30:21.588
Tara, you've been holding back.

30:32.032 --> 30:34.234
HARROD: I can't let this proceed
with you, Ms. Wilson.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.737
You're not yet a member
of the bar.

30:36.770 --> 30:38.805
I'm sure Mr. Shore
will be here imminently.

30:38.839 --> 30:40.473
Well, that's not good enough.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.576
Take Mr. Huff back into custody.

30:42.609 --> 30:43.510
Call the next case.

30:43.544 --> 30:45.278
(door opens)

30:45.311 --> 30:47.313
SHORE: I'm terribly sorry.

30:47.347 --> 30:48.582
Did I miss anything good?

30:48.615 --> 30:51.552
Mr. Shore, I run a punctual,
crisp courtroom.

30:51.585 --> 30:53.186
SHORE: I appreciate that,
Your Honor. I apologize.

30:53.219 --> 30:54.721
And I can make
this very short.

30:54.755 --> 30:56.389
We only seek
to change our plea.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.291
It's a formality.
Should take about two seconds.

30:58.324 --> 30:59.459
Hello.

30:59.492 --> 31:00.667
HARROD:
You're changing your plea?

31:00.701 --> 31:01.635
To what?

31:01.668 --> 31:04.170
Not guilty by reason
of automatism.

31:04.671 --> 31:05.806
What did you say?

31:05.839 --> 31:07.240
Automatism?

31:07.273 --> 31:08.108
It's actually one word,
Your Honor.

31:08.141 --> 31:09.209
It basically
means my client

31:09.242 --> 31:10.811
was not in control
of his actions.

31:12.546 --> 31:14.180
Well, I won't let you
argue that.

31:14.214 --> 31:15.381
I beg your pardon?

31:15.415 --> 31:18.018
HARROD: You'll not make
a mockery of this court,

31:18.051 --> 31:18.885
Counsel.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.153
On what factual basis do you--

31:20.186 --> 31:22.488
SHORE: Your Honor,
if you walked in on your wife

31:22.523 --> 31:23.489
with your best friend,

31:23.524 --> 31:24.958
wouldn't you go a little blooey?

31:28.328 --> 31:31.264
(music playing)

31:43.677 --> 31:45.612
The last lawyer before me
from your firm

31:45.646 --> 31:47.347
insulted the integrity
of this room.

31:47.380 --> 31:49.583
I will not let it happen again.

31:51.351 --> 31:53.253
I'm not liking you so far.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.988
How about this?
Deny my defense,

31:55.021 --> 31:57.591
I'll get you tossed for abuse
of judicial discretion,

31:57.624 --> 31:58.825
and we can be done
with each other.

31:58.859 --> 31:59.626
Does that work for you?

31:59.660 --> 32:00.534
Oh, you won't be done with me,

32:00.567 --> 32:01.802
Mr. Shore.

32:01.835 --> 32:02.636
I assure you.

32:03.970 --> 32:05.405
Are you attracted to me,
Judge?

32:06.139 --> 32:07.040
WILSON: (chuckles)

32:09.810 --> 32:11.778
Our plea is not guilty

32:11.812 --> 32:13.747
by reason of automatism.

32:13.780 --> 32:15.081
Deal with it.

32:29.830 --> 32:32.666
Uh, this could be--

32:33.867 --> 32:34.935
well, uh...

32:35.802 --> 32:37.738
there's something
you need to know, Melissa.

32:37.771 --> 32:39.072
I already know.

32:40.741 --> 32:41.542
You do?

32:41.575 --> 32:42.743
Yes, I do.

32:43.577 --> 32:44.811
And all I can say...

32:45.912 --> 32:47.013
is thank you.

32:47.981 --> 32:50.584
Mr. Torrance came to my house
this morning.

32:50.617 --> 32:52.218
He actually drove
right to my house.

32:52.886 --> 32:54.888
Uh, Mr. Torrance?

32:54.921 --> 32:56.089
From the airline.

32:56.923 --> 32:58.792
He told me how relentless
you've been.

32:59.225 --> 33:00.567
He also told me

33:00.601 --> 33:02.669
you even offered to put up
some of your own money

33:02.703 --> 33:03.737
if they'd match it.

33:04.137 --> 33:06.039
Oh. Uh...

33:06.072 --> 33:07.741
Mr. Torrance told you that?

33:08.208 --> 33:10.376
And then he offered $25,000

33:11.144 --> 33:12.579
and something else,

33:13.246 --> 33:14.314
an apology.

33:15.381 --> 33:16.817
He said they were wrong.

33:17.417 --> 33:18.685
He looked me right in the eye

33:18.719 --> 33:21.522
and told me how sorry he was.

33:22.623 --> 33:24.658
Then he did the same
with Amanda.

33:26.026 --> 33:28.562
Said he knew what
his employees forgot,

33:29.796 --> 33:31.131
that we're human beings.

33:32.766 --> 33:33.767
Anyway...

33:33.800 --> 33:35.969
I accepted his offer.

33:36.002 --> 33:38.038
Probably should have called,
run it by you first,

33:38.839 --> 33:40.406
but the truth is,

33:40.440 --> 33:42.743
I got all I wanted,

33:42.776 --> 33:44.277
so I said yes.

33:45.546 --> 33:47.047
Thank you, Ms. Stringer.

33:52.753 --> 33:54.287
I'll never forget this.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.308
Conspiracy to commit murder,

34:08.341 --> 34:10.010
we'll agree to 10,

34:10.043 --> 34:12.212
accessory, another 10.

34:13.112 --> 34:14.480
Served concurrently.

34:16.216 --> 34:17.350
Mr. Young?

34:18.150 --> 34:19.119
It's a start.

34:19.719 --> 34:20.485
A start?

34:21.054 --> 34:22.487
Your client
ordered an execution.

34:22.523 --> 34:24.525
The most he will serve
is 10 years.

34:24.558 --> 34:27.027
It seems like a fair offer,
Mr. Young.

34:27.060 --> 34:28.661
It is, but I can't recommend it.

34:28.695 --> 34:29.530
Why not?

34:30.463 --> 34:31.364
Because I got
a better-than-even chance

34:31.397 --> 34:32.632
of getting a not guilty.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.967
FOX: Mr. Young,
for everybody's sake,

34:35.001 --> 34:36.703
and I do mean everybody,

34:36.737 --> 34:38.639
a trial would be best avoided.

34:39.405 --> 34:40.607
I'm not following.

34:40.641 --> 34:42.308
Are you asking me to tank this?

34:42.342 --> 34:45.145
FOX: No. I'm endorsing
the district attorney's offer

34:45.178 --> 34:46.379
as a reasonable one.

34:46.980 --> 34:48.549
Ten years for murder
is a bargain,

34:48.581 --> 34:51.317
and the cost of going
to trial would be immeasurable

34:51.351 --> 34:52.652
for all the players,

34:52.686 --> 34:54.588
not to mention
the City of Boston.

34:54.621 --> 34:55.755
Those factors aren't relevant,
not to my...

34:55.789 --> 34:56.690
Are you kidding?

34:57.190 --> 34:59.192
The reason I plucked you
in the first place

34:59.225 --> 35:01.267
is because of the racial
ramifications.

35:01.301 --> 35:02.669
The city is rife--

35:02.703 --> 35:04.337
This is a case
I think I can beat,

35:04.370 --> 35:06.472
given that I will not recommend
to my client

35:06.507 --> 35:07.808
he plead guilty.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.180
You plucked me, Judge.

35:14.214 --> 35:15.281
You got me.

35:17.618 --> 35:19.853
Are you sure
this is what you want,

35:19.886 --> 35:21.254
Counsel?

35:30.631 --> 35:31.865
WILSON: I still can't believe

35:31.898 --> 35:33.634
that he didn't lock you up.
I wish he had.

35:33.667 --> 35:35.201
It'd be easier
to get rid of him.

35:36.402 --> 35:37.938
Next step,
tap into your network,

35:37.971 --> 35:40.941
find me a British medical expert
on automatism.

35:40.974 --> 35:42.308
Why British?

35:42.342 --> 35:44.745
The Americans think
the English are smarter.

35:44.778 --> 35:46.312
Jamie.
Hey.

35:49.382 --> 35:51.451
Did you tell Alan
about my little predicament?

35:52.385 --> 35:53.119
I'm sorry?

35:54.621 --> 35:57.423
Is it Alan Shore,
by the way,

35:57.958 --> 35:59.259
or Torrance?

36:00.366 --> 36:02.302
I've never been good at riddles.

36:02.335 --> 36:03.804
It had to be you.

36:03.837 --> 36:04.505
Who else?

36:08.308 --> 36:09.409
He went to Melissa Kenner

36:09.442 --> 36:11.477
and pretended to be somebody
from the airline

36:11.512 --> 36:12.746
and settled the case.

36:16.650 --> 36:17.684
You put up your own money?

36:19.853 --> 36:22.055
All she really wanted
was the apology.

36:24.190 --> 36:25.659
Why would you do this?

36:25.692 --> 36:26.793
You barely know me.

36:26.827 --> 36:29.495
Well, any chance
I get to break a law.

36:33.299 --> 36:35.135
I don't know...

36:35.168 --> 36:37.738
whether to thank you
or to curse you

36:37.771 --> 36:39.405
for getting me
in even deeper.

36:42.142 --> 36:43.844
But I'm gonna go
with thank you.

36:55.421 --> 36:56.757
You put up your own money?

36:58.091 --> 36:59.059
What's going on?

36:59.560 --> 37:00.734
Meaning?

37:00.767 --> 37:03.336
Meaning that you're not
that nice a fellow.

37:03.369 --> 37:06.906
You know, I like to fantasize
when I go to bed,

37:06.940 --> 37:08.374
helps me sleep.

37:08.407 --> 37:11.210
I've been having
wonderful sessions with you

37:11.244 --> 37:12.211
in mind, actually.

37:12.812 --> 37:13.913
But with Jamie,

37:13.947 --> 37:16.716
I keep hitting a block.

37:16.750 --> 37:19.018
Sex isn't all...

37:19.052 --> 37:20.954
body parts for me, Tara.

37:20.987 --> 37:21.688
It's mental.

37:22.255 --> 37:24.525
I've been sensing...

37:24.558 --> 37:27.493
Jamie's repelled by me
for some reason.

37:27.528 --> 37:31.131
Now that I've perhaps
courted her favor,

37:31.164 --> 37:34.367
I'm hoping
that my fantasy could...

37:34.400 --> 37:35.501
have a life.

37:36.903 --> 37:39.873
Tara, whether I'm committing
random acts of kindness,

37:39.906 --> 37:42.609
or impersonating
an airline executive,

37:42.643 --> 37:44.978
or even talking back
to a judge,

37:45.011 --> 37:47.914
it's always
about getting the girl.

37:47.948 --> 37:49.550
Even if it's only
in your mind?

37:49.583 --> 37:52.519
The one place
I'm never disappointed.

37:53.086 --> 37:54.655
You know what I love
about your talk, Alan?

37:54.688 --> 37:56.523
SHORE: Hmm?
Is it makes me feel safe.

37:56.557 --> 37:57.891
Does it, now?
WILSON: Uh-hmm,

37:57.924 --> 38:00.060
because men who talk

38:00.093 --> 38:01.935
never do anything.

38:03.103 --> 38:05.471
Would you like me
to be a doer, Tara?

38:08.509 --> 38:10.644
I never make the first move.

38:11.945 --> 38:13.547
It's beneath me.

38:13.580 --> 38:16.149
I always make
the first move,

38:18.885 --> 38:20.286
but I'm not going to here.

38:22.355 --> 38:24.224
Happy to make the second,

38:25.491 --> 38:27.060
perhaps the third,

38:29.162 --> 38:32.866
but you need to go first...

38:32.899 --> 38:33.834
Alan.

38:35.135 --> 38:36.770
It needs to be you.

38:37.604 --> 38:39.005
I think not.

38:39.039 --> 38:40.306
Oh, it will be.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.975
Oh, it won't.

38:42.676 --> 38:44.277
I'm waiting, Tara.

38:44.310 --> 38:46.513
Things are beginning
to tingle.

38:46.547 --> 38:48.515
I'm right here,

38:48.549 --> 38:49.683
Alan.

38:58.792 --> 39:00.500
Your instincts were correct.

39:00.534 --> 39:02.636
That offer is unacceptable.

39:02.669 --> 39:04.938
YOUNG: Look, uh, I don't mean
to sound too confident.

39:04.971 --> 39:07.574
In the public's mind,
you already stand convicted.

39:07.608 --> 39:09.075
And 10 years...

39:09.109 --> 39:10.811
it's not a bad deal.

39:10.844 --> 39:13.880
I would not last one day
in prison, Mr. Young,

39:13.914 --> 39:16.016
much less 10 years.

39:16.049 --> 39:18.351
Not exactly my demographic.

39:19.119 --> 39:19.986
Sorry?

39:20.020 --> 39:22.455
I don't mean to disparage you.

39:22.488 --> 39:24.858
You think prisons
are full of black people.

39:24.891 --> 39:26.827
We don't need to get into this.

39:26.860 --> 39:27.894
Oh, I got time.

39:27.928 --> 39:29.563
Eugene.
Mr. Young.

39:33.066 --> 39:35.836
In this country, there are
more black men in prison

39:35.869 --> 39:38.972
than there are in college,
Mr. Young.

39:39.005 --> 39:40.941
That is not
a white-supremacist opinion.

39:40.974 --> 39:42.342
It is a fact.

39:42.375 --> 39:43.944
And you don't think
that has anything to do

39:43.977 --> 39:45.178
with the white society

39:45.211 --> 39:45.879
that has...
Uh, all right.

39:48.214 --> 39:50.116
Let's just stick to the case.

39:52.586 --> 39:55.288
The offer of 10 years
is officially rejected.

39:57.290 --> 39:59.526
I did not kill anybody.

40:00.934 --> 40:02.503
There won't be any plea.

40:07.774 --> 40:09.643
Mr. Young...

40:09.676 --> 40:13.614
you and I need to get
on the same side now.

40:13.647 --> 40:16.049
My trial begins in six days.

40:17.751 --> 40:19.352
Mr. Macklin,

40:19.385 --> 40:22.789
I will give you
the best defense I can,

40:22.823 --> 40:25.859
but you and I will never be
on the same side.

40:29.462 --> 40:30.997
I am a human being.

40:33.066 --> 40:35.836
I need you to see me

40:35.869 --> 40:37.337
as a human being.

40:39.840 --> 40:42.543
Certainly you're capable
of doing that.

40:45.411 --> 40:48.348
(music playing)

41:03.403 --> 41:06.339
(music playing)

41:29.329 --> 41:30.797
WOMAN: You stinker!

41:30.831 --> 41:33.834
(music playing)
