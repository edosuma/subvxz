She's in the corps, too.

13:49.306 --> 13:52.962
That's Grace Pressley.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.182
Ashley Fallon.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.879
[sobbing softly]

13:56.923 --> 13:58.968
I feel sick.

14:10.327 --> 14:10.458
.

14:10.501 --> 14:13.026
- Edward and I
hooked up last year.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.854
This was at his parents' house.

14:16.507 --> 14:19.510
This one...
oh, my God.

14:20.816 --> 14:23.645
That's Alistair's desk.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.777
Edward kind of dared me.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.779
- Did you know
he was filming you?

14:27.823 --> 14:30.870
- No.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.307
I'm on a visa.
I have to be careful.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.748
Who's seen these?

14:43.795 --> 14:46.624
- Did Jason post this
on the porn site too?

14:46.668 --> 14:50.715
- Not to our knowledge.
- I can't have that happen.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.717
I'm engaged.
My fiancé's family

14:52.761 --> 14:54.850
is very religious.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.548
- I don't think Jason
wants to make things worse.

14:57.592 --> 14:58.941
He's in a lot of trouble
right now.

14:58.985 --> 15:02.553
- Not with the company.
There are 20 ballerinas

15:02.597 --> 15:05.078
to every male dancer.

15:05.121 --> 15:09.647
These guys can't get fired.
[sighs]

15:09.691 --> 15:11.867
[breathes deeply]

15:13.521 --> 15:17.438
- Yeah, so that happened.
- You knew?

15:17.481 --> 15:19.701
- Did I know I was
having sex with Brad?

15:19.744 --> 15:23.444
Yeah.
Did I know I was being filmed?

15:23.487 --> 15:25.402
I mean, not that time,
but everyone's made

15:25.446 --> 15:27.709
a sex tape or two, right?
Anyway, just thank God

15:27.752 --> 15:29.841
it didn't get posted
like Delia's.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.453
- Captain Benson,
is everything all right?

15:32.496 --> 15:35.456
- Uh, actually, no.
- Ashley?

15:35.499 --> 15:37.110
- Uh, yeah,
just heading to rehearsal.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.939
- Oh, good, you need it.
You too, Tina.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.766
Let's go, honey.
- Right behind her.

15:41.810 --> 15:42.985
- Mm-hmm.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.118
- This is Sascha Thomas,
our choreographer.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.598
- Captain Benson.
- I filled him in.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.209
- Yeah.

15:49.252 --> 15:52.864
And I'm working around three
male dancers being unavailable

15:52.908 --> 15:56.651
this afternoon because
they're sitting in detention

15:56.694 --> 15:58.870
at your station.
- They may be unavailable

15:58.914 --> 16:01.438
longer than that.
- Oh, come on now.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.702
There's no one sexier
than young dancers.

16:04.746 --> 16:07.705
Get enough of them in a room
together, this is what happens.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.621
- Sascha, this is more than
just boys being boys.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.623
- Yeah, I get it, yes.
[chuckles]

16:12.667 --> 16:15.452
We'll make sure that whatever's
been happening stops now.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.150
And it won't happen again.

16:17.193 --> 16:20.675
- Well, depending on where this
goes, they could be looking

16:20.718 --> 16:24.548
at prison time.
- Hmm, well...

16:24.592 --> 16:26.507
that does not work

16:26.550 --> 16:29.727
because we have a premiere
in three days.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.860
We're talking hundreds of jobs,
weeks of rehearsal,

16:31.903 --> 16:33.470
millions of dollars
on the line--

16:33.514 --> 16:34.950
- Piece of advice?

16:37.257 --> 16:39.955
Let's set aside some time
for understudies.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.614
- Excuse me.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.707
- Unlawful surveillance?
- Mm-hmm.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.926
- It's obviously consensual.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.972
The girls look like
they're playing to the camera.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.974
- Well, they all say
that they weren't aware

16:59.018 --> 17:00.671
they were being recorded.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.934
- Well, my clients
say otherwise.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.806
Maybe the girls
have regrets now.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.677
- They swear they didn't know
they were being filmed,

17:06.721 --> 17:08.940
and they absolutely did not
want the videos shared--

17:08.984 --> 17:10.855
Have you seen the texts
between the boys?

17:10.899 --> 17:12.640
Here's a transcript.
Shall we read it out loud?

17:12.683 --> 17:14.555
- All this proves
is that they're idiots.

17:14.598 --> 17:15.904
- [scoffs]
- I should know,

17:15.947 --> 17:19.473
I'm Brad's mother.
Being an idiot is not illegal.

17:19.516 --> 17:20.778
- But dissemination is.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.215
And they're definitely
guilty of that.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.260
- It's just guy stuff.
- A competition.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.480
You know, with, like,
points and everything.

17:26.523 --> 17:27.611
We didn't hurt anyone.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.004
- Why don't you ask Delia?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.963
I mean, you're still
rehearsing together.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.965
Did you even talk to her
about any of this?

17:34.009 --> 17:36.794
- My mom told me not to talk
about this to anyone

17:36.838 --> 17:39.536
because there's...
legal stuff involved.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.756
- My son feels terrible about
this being distributed

17:41.799 --> 17:44.498
on porn sites and had
absolutely no involvement

17:44.541 --> 17:46.065
in that.
- He distributed it via text

17:46.108 --> 17:48.589
to all of his dance buddies.
- First degree.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.982
An E felony.
- Clearly an overreach.

17:51.026 --> 17:53.855
Maybe this rises to the level
of misdemeanor harassment.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.117
- Hmm.
- [scoffs]

17:55.161 --> 17:58.294
- We all know the real
felon here is Jason.

17:58.338 --> 18:01.863
Surveillance, dissemination,
it's all on him.

18:01.906 --> 18:05.084
My clients can help you
make that case.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.871
- Okay, so Brad and Edward
are willing to testify

18:09.914 --> 18:11.873
that Jason set up the camera?
- Well, in exchange

18:11.916 --> 18:13.614
for bumping them down
to misdemeanor harassment.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.268
- Can't we get them
on misdemeanor dissemination?

18:15.311 --> 18:17.661
- She's smart, she doesn't
want that on their records.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.707
- Okay, so this is our best
chance to get one of

18:19.750 --> 18:21.274
the three boys on a felony.
- Yeah, with their testimony,

18:21.317 --> 18:23.928
we can get Jason on unlawful
surveillance, dissemination,

18:23.972 --> 18:25.843
and toss in revenge porn
for the hat trick.

18:25.887 --> 18:29.760
- Which is gonna be tough to
prove because we have to show

18:29.804 --> 18:32.763
intent to harm, which,
even so, is just a misdemeanor.

18:32.807 --> 18:35.114
- So texting the video to a
friend is worse than posting it

18:35.157 --> 18:36.680
on a porn site?
- Tech lobbies,

18:36.724 --> 18:38.291
corporations,
civil libertarians--

18:38.334 --> 18:39.944
they got their fingerprints
all over the state's

18:39.988 --> 18:42.860
revenge porn bill.
It's basically toothless.

18:42.904 --> 18:46.560
- But Jason doesn't know that.
And he hasn't lawyered up yet.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.039
This might give us
some leverage.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.606
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, what's Jason

18:49.650 --> 18:51.739
gonna give us that
we don't already have?

18:51.782 --> 18:53.828
- You never know.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.092
[dramatic musical sting]

18:57.136 --> 18:59.050
- Revenge on Delia?
Seriously?

18:59.094 --> 19:00.704
[laughs]
I get plenty.

19:00.748 --> 19:03.707
- Well, then why did you send
the video to a porn site?

19:03.751 --> 19:05.056
[laughs]
I don't know.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.971
I thought it was
a goof on Brad.

19:07.015 --> 19:09.626
- Well, Delia didn't
consent to being filmed.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.106
- Well, that's not
what Brad told me.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.890
How was I supposed to know?
- Because you're the one

19:12.934 --> 19:16.633
who installed the camera
in Studio X.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.722
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, your dance buddies

19:18.766 --> 19:20.681
told us the whole thing
was your idea.

19:20.724 --> 19:24.119
- Okay, hang on, I--I don't
know who set up the camera,

19:24.163 --> 19:25.773
but it wasn't me.
- Well, that's not

19:25.816 --> 19:28.863
what they said.
And they're willing to testify.

19:28.906 --> 19:31.126
- Testify?
- Mm-hmm.

19:32.388 --> 19:35.826
- Like at a trial?
- Yeah, like at a trial.

19:35.870 --> 19:39.003
And with unlawful surveillance
and dissemination charges,

19:39.047 --> 19:41.702
you're looking at
felony jail time.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.922
- [scoffs]
This is total crap.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.185
I'm the fall guy.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.709
Everybody in the company
knew about it.

19:48.752 --> 19:51.842
Brad, Edward, Sascha.
- Sascha?

19:54.758 --> 19:57.196
Your choreographer?

19:57.239 --> 19:59.981
- Jason, if you know
more than you're saying,

20:00.024 --> 20:02.113
now would be your last chance
to help yourself.

20:02.157 --> 20:05.682
- And start with Sascha Thomas.

20:07.162 --> 20:09.686
- [sighs]

20:09.730 --> 20:11.122
We showed him
some stuff before.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.734
He never said boo.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.823
H-He would--
he would watch the videos

20:15.866 --> 20:17.825
like the girls
were auditioning for him.

20:17.868 --> 20:21.045
- And he never
told you to stop?

20:23.744 --> 20:25.789
- If he liked something he saw,
he'd ask a girl out,

20:25.833 --> 20:30.446
and if she said yes,
he'd make me delete it.

20:30.490 --> 20:34.842
[dark music]

20:34.885 --> 20:37.845
[dramatic orchestral
music playing]

20:37.888 --> 20:39.803
- There are no videos
of me and Jason.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.022
- Because Sascha
had it deleted?

20:41.065 --> 20:44.895
- You know about that?
Sascha's a friend.

20:44.939 --> 20:47.158
- With benefits.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.160
- After Sascha saw the video,
he said he needed to make sure

20:49.204 --> 20:52.207
it didn't get out,
or my career would be over.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.165
- But not Jason's?
- [scoffs]

20:54.209 --> 20:56.864
You kidding?
There's a hundred other dancers

20:56.907 --> 21:00.433
who could be in my costume
and my solo tomorrow.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.043
Sascha said he'd make sure
that didn't happen.

21:02.086 --> 21:05.829
- And what did he
want in return?

21:05.873 --> 21:09.180
- For me to do to him what
I did to Jason in the video.

21:09.224 --> 21:12.009
- Tina, he pressured you.

21:12.053 --> 21:15.186
He extorted you.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.276
That's rape.

21:17.319 --> 21:20.801
- Like any of the other girls
wouldn't do it.

21:20.844 --> 21:24.283
Sascha saw all the videos.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.242
He chose me.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.853
[clapping]

21:29.897 --> 21:32.029
- Tina, that was your cue.

21:32.073 --> 21:35.294
- Tina--
- Sorry, my solo.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.995
- Not the time.
Ladies.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.781
- Well, she says
it wasn't rape.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.871
That's that.
- Well, from what I heard,

21:47.915 --> 21:51.005
rape culture is so much
a part of this company,

21:51.048 --> 21:54.008
they don't even
realize it anymore.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.273
[exhales]

22:02.669 --> 22:02.799
.

22:02.843 --> 22:05.236
- Tina said the sex
was consensual?

22:05.280 --> 22:06.455
- It wasn't, she just doesn't
wanna see it that way.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.239
Sascha's her boss,
he gave her the choice

22:08.283 --> 22:10.416
of losing her job or getting
a solo, depending on whether

22:10.459 --> 22:12.026
or not she was gonna
reenact that video with him.

22:12.069 --> 22:14.420
- It's forcible coercion,
rape three.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.378
- In theory, yes.
But his defense attorney's

22:16.422 --> 22:19.033
gonna say the relationship
was consensual.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.383
At worst, transactional,
one in which she was

22:21.427 --> 22:23.690
a willing part of.
- Sascha?

22:23.733 --> 22:25.474
From what the other dancers
said, this is happening

22:25.518 --> 22:27.520
all the time at the company.
- Then we need to try

22:27.563 --> 22:29.522
to establish a pattern.
Are there any other

22:29.565 --> 22:31.698
allegations against Sascha?
- No official complaints

22:31.741 --> 22:33.526
lodged with
the National HR department.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.702
- Yeah, the cone of silence
in ballet is real.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.660
I knew a few bunheads
at LaGuardia--

22:37.704 --> 22:41.316
rehearse nonstop, never spoke
out of turn, never ate--

22:41.360 --> 22:42.709
I mean, that kind of
conditioning sticks with you.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.711
- Listen, this isn't
just ballet.

22:44.754 --> 22:49.280
It's churches, news
organizations, movie sets.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.674
When your boss is a predator,
people are afraid.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.328
[cell phone buzzes]

22:53.372 --> 22:55.678
- Well, unless someone breaks
ranks, we're stalled.

22:55.722 --> 22:59.813
- [groans]
More bad news.

22:59.856 --> 23:02.729
Cybercrime said somebody ran
Delia's image through

23:02.772 --> 23:07.386
facial recognition.
Her identity has gone viral.

23:11.694 --> 23:14.305
Hey.
- Now anytime someone searches

23:14.349 --> 23:16.351
my name,
this video comes up.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.397
How long before
my parents see it?

23:18.440 --> 23:21.400
- Cybercrimes are tracking
down the sites one by one,

23:21.443 --> 23:24.577
enforcing the court order.
Delia, it's just--

23:24.620 --> 23:26.535
it's not easy.
- In the meantime,

23:26.579 --> 23:27.928
we can help you
get the links removed

23:27.971 --> 23:30.539
from the search engines.
- No one knows who I am

23:30.583 --> 23:34.761
in the ballet world.
This is what I'm famous for?

23:34.804 --> 23:36.763
The National's gonna fire me.
- Delia.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.721
They're not gonna fire you.
- They're too busy covering

23:38.765 --> 23:41.115
their own asses.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.639
- I don't understand.
- So, it turns out

23:43.683 --> 23:46.512
that Sascha looked
at the videos.

23:46.555 --> 23:49.428
It's not just about
the boys anymore.

23:49.471 --> 23:52.126
- So he knew?
He didn't stop them?

23:52.169 --> 23:55.129
- Just the opposite.
- [exhales sharply]

23:55.172 --> 23:58.611
So there was a video of Tina?
That's why she slept with him?

23:58.654 --> 24:01.135
Everyone was wondering why
she finally got her solo.

24:01.178 --> 24:04.660
- Delia, do you know of any
other dancers that were

24:04.704 --> 24:07.446
involved with Sascha?

24:09.535 --> 24:13.800
- Wait, you guys are
going after Sascha now?

24:16.846 --> 24:19.545
- No way.
I'm out.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.416
- Hang on.
- No, I never should have

24:21.460 --> 24:25.464
come to you in the first place.
He's the choreographer.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.640
He gets to do
whatever he wants.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.816
- Not if you're willing
to help us.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.818
- It's ballet!

24:31.861 --> 24:33.646
It's like my friend
Hudson says,

24:33.689 --> 24:36.910
"Straight male, can't fail.
Gay men, it depends.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.695
But girls in ballet?

24:39.739 --> 24:42.611
Do what we say."

24:54.841 --> 24:56.625
- Five more minutes, Hudson.

24:59.759 --> 25:02.675
- How long you out?
- Rest of the season.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.852
Fifth surgery in ten years.

25:05.895 --> 25:08.855
But no one leaves ballet until
they're fired or crippled.

25:08.898 --> 25:11.422
[laughs softly]

25:11.466 --> 25:13.947
You here to talk to me
about Delia?

25:13.990 --> 25:16.210
Poor kid.
- You knew what was happening?

25:16.253 --> 25:19.648
- Honey, everybody knows.
- But no one says anything?

25:19.692 --> 25:23.957
- It's a straight male world.
We just dance in it.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.612
You dance?

25:26.655 --> 25:29.615
- Uh, hip-hop, modern.

25:29.658 --> 25:32.182
I was a little--
- Statuesque for ballet?

25:32.226 --> 25:34.750
[both laugh]

25:34.794 --> 25:38.885
Look, if you're here to talk
to me about male dancers

25:38.928 --> 25:41.191
videotaping girls,
I can't help you.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.890
- Actually, I'm here to ask
you about your choreographer.

25:43.933 --> 25:46.457
- Sascha? What's to know?
He's a pig.

25:46.501 --> 25:49.809
- Can you give me
any specifics?

25:49.852 --> 25:52.768
- You want me to be the
Norma Rae of the National?

25:52.812 --> 25:55.728
While I'm hanging on to my spot
in the company by a thread?

25:55.771 --> 25:58.513
Talk to me in a few years.
- So that's it?

25:58.557 --> 25:59.732
These girls are
just on their own?

25:59.775 --> 26:02.691
- They know the drill.
You want this life,

26:02.735 --> 26:04.780
you pay the price.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.699
- Hey, Kat, any luck?
- Struck out again.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.658
- So we're 0 for everyone?
- [sighs]

26:12.701 --> 26:14.921
- They've danced their whole
lives, sacrificed everything

26:14.964 --> 26:17.619
to get to the National.
They have too much to lose.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.751
Sorry.

26:18.794 --> 26:21.580
- Don't be.
Just need to find somebody

26:21.623 --> 26:23.843
who already lost.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.760
- That was a lifetime ago.

26:27.803 --> 26:30.676
- That was at the gala
last year.

26:30.719 --> 26:34.810
It's right after you got
picked to be the principal.

26:34.854 --> 26:38.640
- How did you get my name?
I quit the company a year ago.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.990
No one from the National
has even called.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.949
- We read the interview
in your hometown paper,

26:42.992 --> 26:44.994
"The Suffolk Times."

26:45.038 --> 26:46.909
How excited you were
to get your first lead,

26:46.953 --> 26:50.870
and you never actually danced.

26:50.913 --> 26:53.829
- You're with NYPD,
why do you care?

26:53.873 --> 26:56.963
- Well, we're looking
into a company-wide pattern

26:57.006 --> 27:00.053
of--of sexual abuse.
- You're actually investigating

27:00.096 --> 27:02.664
those pricks?
- We are.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.623
- How did you even
find out about this?

27:04.666 --> 27:07.930
Who came forward?
- Delia Kelly, initially.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.977
- Oh, no,
she was one of my students.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.675
Sascha raped her too?

27:13.719 --> 27:17.679
- Is Sascha the reason
that you left the company?

27:17.723 --> 27:20.551
- Well, he's the reason
I'm here.

27:24.817 --> 27:29.691
Jason made a sex tape of me.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.998
Sascha got a hold of it,
told me he could make it

27:32.041 --> 27:36.872
go away if I did to him
what I did to Jason.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.877
He wouldn't take no
for an answer.

27:41.921 --> 27:46.012
I just gave up
and let him do it.

27:46.055 --> 27:49.145
- Rose, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

27:50.756 --> 27:54.368
- Few days later,
he promoted me,

27:54.411 --> 27:59.895
told me that what happened
was just between he and I,

27:59.939 --> 28:02.898
and that he'd do it again
any time he wanted.

28:02.942 --> 28:06.902
- Did you tell anybody?

28:06.946 --> 28:10.036
I mean, any other dancers
or friends or family?

28:10.079 --> 28:11.733
- [scoffs]

28:11.777 --> 28:15.128
I told the one person
who I thought could help me--

28:15.171 --> 28:18.740
Alistair.
Alistair said he would help me,

28:18.784 --> 28:22.091
that I could do a lot better
than Sascha.

28:22.135 --> 28:26.052
- And what did he mean?

28:26.095 --> 28:29.403
- Every year
at the gala auction,

28:29.446 --> 28:33.886
dinner with the prima ballerina
is the top item.

28:33.929 --> 28:37.977
But what's expected
is not just dinner.

28:40.022 --> 28:43.896
Alistair said if I'd let him
auction me off,

28:43.939 --> 28:46.768
he'd get Sascha to back down.

28:49.771 --> 28:53.819
Then he told me
if I said no,

28:53.862 --> 28:56.952
he'd leak Jason's sex tape,

28:56.996 --> 28:59.955
fire me immediately for cause,

28:59.999 --> 29:04.699
and blackball me
with every other company.

29:04.743 --> 29:09.095
- So that's why you left.

29:09.138 --> 29:13.752
- I didn't even dance
the premiere.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.667
I couldn't go on that night.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.935
And Alistair was right.

29:22.978 --> 29:25.894
I've never danced since.

29:38.080 --> 29:38.254
.

29:38.298 --> 29:40.735
- Okay, so the highest bids
at every gala auction are for

29:40.779 --> 29:42.128
a "Dinner for Two
with a Ballerina."

29:42.171 --> 29:43.651
That doesn't prove these women
are being sex trafficked--

29:43.694 --> 29:45.566
- You said that you wanted
a pattern, and we have one.

29:45.609 --> 29:47.568
- Go ahead.
- So the male dancers

29:47.611 --> 29:51.093
are secretly recording the
women having sex with them.

29:51.137 --> 29:54.357
Sascha is using the tapes
to blackmail these women

29:54.401 --> 29:57.621
into reenacting
these videos, right?

29:57.665 --> 30:01.538
So if they consent or if they
just fail to fight him off,

30:01.582 --> 30:04.193
they get solos.
- Yeah, but none of these women

30:04.237 --> 30:07.283
are willing to testify.
- Rose Sullivan is.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.416
- She told us that Sascha
coerced her,

30:09.459 --> 30:11.853
when she went to Alistair
with it, he doubled down,

30:11.897 --> 30:13.463
blackmailed her, and told
her if she didn't sleep

30:13.507 --> 30:16.162
with the highest bidder,
that she would lose her job.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.207
- We're looking
at sex trafficking here.

30:18.251 --> 30:21.341
- Okay, maybe--did she
actually go through with it?

30:21.384 --> 30:23.386
No?
[groans]

30:23.430 --> 30:25.127
So the board's gonna circle
the wagons,

30:25.171 --> 30:26.607
the dancers aren't talking,

30:26.650 --> 30:28.391
and these donors
sponsoring ballerinas--

30:28.435 --> 30:29.828
they certainly won't.
So at the end of the day,

30:29.871 --> 30:32.526
this is Rose's word against
Sascha and Alistair's.

30:32.569 --> 30:34.484
- All right, you got any ideas
or are you just gonna keep

30:34.528 --> 30:36.356
playing the "I'm the ADA,
I need more" card?

30:36.399 --> 30:37.444
- Rollins.

30:37.487 --> 30:38.532
- You know what would
be helpful?

30:38.575 --> 30:40.229
A confession.
How about that idea?

30:40.273 --> 30:41.535
- I don't see that happening.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.406
- Or we catch him in the act.

30:43.450 --> 30:46.583
This year's gala is tomorrow
night after the premiere.

30:46.627 --> 30:51.545
We put in a UC,
and we get Alistair on tape

30:51.588 --> 30:53.373
promising to deliver the goods.
- Huh.

30:53.416 --> 30:56.506
- How about Hasim Khaldun?
- Your transit-groper cop?

30:56.550 --> 31:00.510
- He could pass as an oil heir.
- Or a venture capitalist

31:00.554 --> 31:03.731
from Silicon Valley.
He's--He's a chameleon.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.214

31:08.257 --> 31:09.606

31:09.650 --> 31:12.174
- I'd rather be in jeans
on the E train.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.915
- How was the ballet?

31:13.959 --> 31:15.917
- The last ballet I saw
was "The Nutcracker"

31:15.961 --> 31:18.267
when I was ten.
This was better.

31:18.311 --> 31:19.616

31:19.660 --> 31:22.228
So did Sascha walk you
through the night?

31:22.271 --> 31:24.317
- Briefly.
He's prepped Alistair that

31:24.360 --> 31:26.928
there's a potential "Diamond
Tiara" level tier donor

31:26.972 --> 31:28.495
waiting to meet him.
- Hey, Diamond Tiara.

31:28.538 --> 31:32.238
How much is that?
- If you have to ask...

31:32.281 --> 31:35.284
- Okay, here.
- What's this?

31:35.328 --> 31:37.634
- That's the key
to your hotel suite.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.697

stop singing his praises.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.960
- Oh, they took a leap of faith
in me and my company.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.527
I'm glad it worked out
for all of us.

32:00.570 --> 32:03.530

- Yup, and not looking back.

- And I have to admit,
up until tonight,

32:28.033 --> 32:30.383
I had not seen a lot of ballet.
[both laugh]

32:30.426 --> 32:32.602
- Did you like what you saw?
- Yeah, it was awesome.

32:32.646 --> 32:36.606
I'm assuming Sascha mentioned,
but I'm looking to establish

32:36.650 --> 32:38.565
a presence here in New York
as a benefactor

32:38.608 --> 32:41.437
in the performing arts world.
- He did.

32:41.481 --> 32:44.005
May I suggest,
instead of seeding start-ups,

32:44.049 --> 32:46.660
you make one quality
high-profile investment.

32:46.703 --> 32:49.793
- That's my plan.
I've spoken to some donors

32:49.837 --> 32:53.275
from past years,
and I'm willing to step up

32:53.319 --> 32:55.582

receive the benefits they got.

32:55.625 --> 33:00.021
They mentioned sponsoring
one of the primas.

33:05.374 --> 33:07.637
Ashley was mesmerizing tonight,
wasn't she?

33:07.681 --> 33:11.424

a lot about ballet,

33:11.467 --> 33:13.339
but I couldn't take
my eyes off of her.

33:13.382 --> 33:14.601

with the prima

33:14.644 --> 33:17.038

on the auction.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.519

it's more than dinner.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.741

commitment take Ashley off

33:36.405 --> 33:39.495
the auction block?

33:39.539 --> 33:42.759
- It would take Ashley
anywhere you'd like to go.

33:42.803 --> 33:48.504

at the Park Milano.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.376

Bitcoin would work.

That's not a problem.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.819
- That's an admission.
- It's more like an innuendo.

Ashley still needs to show
she's willing to play for pay.

cooperative so far, right?

this way.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.872
- We all want
to avoid that.

35:35.916 --> 35:40.181
- But you could be looking
at prostitution charges.

35:40.225 --> 35:43.010
- You can't be serious.

35:43.053 --> 35:47.145
- Ashley, we know
this wasn't your plan.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.104
Whose was it?

35:50.148 --> 35:53.238
- I can't say.

35:53.281 --> 35:56.893
- If we call Alistair Woodford
and tell him you were picked up

35:56.937 --> 36:00.593
in a police sting,
about to service a sponsor,

36:00.636 --> 36:03.161
you think he'll protect you?

36:03.204 --> 36:05.250
- He didn't give me any choice.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.904
- We need to know
how this works.

36:12.300 --> 36:16.826
- Every year,
at the gala,

36:16.870 --> 36:19.960
dinner with the prima
goes to the highest bidder.

36:20.003 --> 36:22.092
- Mm-hmm.

36:22.136 --> 36:26.836
- Everybody knows
it's more than just dinner.

36:29.317 --> 36:32.581
This year I was
on the auction block.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.844
- How did he get you
to agree to this?

36:36.933 --> 36:40.110
- Same way he got
everybody else.

36:40.154 --> 36:42.243
He had a video.

36:42.287 --> 36:48.075
Me, Brad, and Jason.

36:48.118 --> 36:53.646
- Does Sascha know about this?
- He gave Alistair the video.

36:53.689 --> 36:58.216
What did Alistair
say to you, exactly?

36:58.259 --> 37:04.657
- He said I'd already worked
my way through the dancers

37:04.700 --> 37:09.662
and the choreographer
for my career,

37:09.705 --> 37:15.363
so compared to that,
this was a small ask.

37:19.019 --> 37:21.064
- And if you refused?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.460
- The video
would be made public.

37:27.462 --> 37:31.249
He said, after that...

37:35.253 --> 37:40.475
The only way I'd be able
to make a living was in porn.

37:44.436 --> 37:45.698
[switch flips]

37:45.741 --> 37:47.003
- That's enough
for an arrest warrant.

37:47.047 --> 37:50.050
- Better idea.
We pick him up now.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.184
- See you Monday.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.448
- Hey.

37:59.102 --> 38:02.280
- Alistair Woodford,
Sascha Thomas.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.717
- Captain Benson,
what is this?

38:04.760 --> 38:07.110
- Give it a second,
it'll come to you.

38:07.154 --> 38:08.938
- You're making
a major mistake.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.027
- Not my first,
won't be my last.

38:11.071 --> 38:13.203
[handcuffs clinking]

38:14.204 --> 38:16.032
- You vouched for him.
- Don't worry.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.034
He's under arrest too.
- Whatever I did,

38:18.078 --> 38:20.385
I did to subsidize art.
That man's your rapist!

38:20.428 --> 38:23.692
- So you knew?
And you used it as leverage.

38:23.736 --> 38:25.346
That makes you
a sex trafficker.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.305
Get him out of here.

38:30.133 --> 38:33.485
- So Alistair and Sascha
took a deal?

38:33.528 --> 38:36.314
- Felonies, both of them.
They'll do prison time.

38:39.317 --> 38:43.712
- What about Jason?
- He'll do a few months,

38:43.756 --> 38:48.978
and we're still working
to get the video taken down.

38:49.022 --> 38:50.458
- Uh-huh.

38:53.156 --> 38:54.984
What happens to the National?

38:55.028 --> 38:59.337
- Well, Brad and Edward
were fired, although...

38:59.380 --> 39:03.993
they're filing a suit
for wrongful termination.

39:04.037 --> 39:07.519
- Of course they are.
Boys in ballet.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.738
From day one,
they get all the breaks.

39:09.782 --> 39:11.392
I bet they'll
get their jobs back.

39:11.436 --> 39:15.353
- [sighs]
Maybe, but maybe not.

39:15.396 --> 39:18.791
You heard that the new board
hired an all-female

39:18.834 --> 39:20.749
artistic team?

39:20.793 --> 39:24.753
- Yeah, good for them.

39:24.797 --> 39:30.368
- Hey, have you, uh, do you
ever consider going back?

39:34.197 --> 39:37.200
- I spent my whole life
in that world.

39:39.159 --> 39:43.119
To leap high,

39:43.163 --> 39:46.471
to spin in midair,

39:46.514 --> 39:49.517
to feel the rush
of an ovation.

39:52.128 --> 39:55.175
It's the only dream
I ever had.

39:58.874 --> 40:04.489
But now,
I imagine dancing onstage...

40:07.187 --> 40:08.841
And the only thing
I can think about

40:08.884 --> 40:13.236
is everyone in the audience
leering at me on the internet.

40:19.547 --> 40:26.249
And that--
that's never going away, is it?

40:34.867 --> 40:38.087
[glasses clinking]

40:43.223 --> 40:45.355
- [exhales softly]

41:25.308 --> 41:28.311
[wolf howls]
