Listen, you are just getting to that age

07:25.960 --> 07:27.327

07:27.362 --> 07:29.450
girls have different bodies than boys.

07:29.485 --> 07:30.797
Maybe you were just trying
to get a look at her...

- Bra.

07:42.110 --> 07:43.510
I mean, if you think about it,

07:43.544 --> 07:45.912
the bra... is like the shoes of the chest.

07:45.947 --> 07:47.514

would be the shoe of your...

of pamphlets on my bed

08:32.360 --> 08:33.827

08:33.861 --> 08:34.849
Hmm.

08:35.049 --> 08:35.861

- Is to be ashamed.
- Right.
