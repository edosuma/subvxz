WEBVTT

00:08.843 --> 00:10.637
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.804 --> 00:12.055
Then where are we at?

00:12.138 --> 00:14.557
The don't tell anyone at work part.

00:14.891 --> 00:16.059
I'd like to break up with you.

00:18.895 --> 00:21.147
Please, leave me alone.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.901
- Can I ask a question?
- Shoot.

00:25.235 --> 00:26.403
Are you guys having sex?

00:26.486 --> 00:28.530
Okay, so you were just studying
and taking drugs

00:28.613 --> 00:30.156
with a boy you lied about
not seeing anymore?

00:30.240 --> 00:31.324
Yeah, Mom.

00:31.408 --> 00:34.077
I took something and I still did everything
I was supposed to do.

00:34.828 --> 00:36.079
You know what that's like, right?

00:36.162 --> 00:38.081
Actually, I've got to go. Kevin is here and...

00:39.124 --> 00:40.834
It's after midnight and Kevin's there?

00:40.917 --> 00:42.085
I love you.

00:42.585 --> 00:43.920
Yeah, I got to go.

00:44.003 --> 00:45.964
I think the girls should live with you.

00:46.256 --> 00:47.882
Grace is using drugs.

00:47.966 --> 00:50.135
I don't think she should be with me.

00:50.468 --> 00:51.636
We're not there yet.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.097
I think we are.

01:54.199 --> 01:55.825
Car's all packed.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.244
One for the road?

01:58.328 --> 01:59.579
Been cooking all morning.

01:59.662 --> 02:00.747
Yeah.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.293
So we're all going to your thing later today.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.003
I'm not. I have Model UN.

02:08.129 --> 02:10.632
I have invited some friends from work,
just so you know.

02:11.758 --> 02:13.092
Like Eddie?

02:13.176 --> 02:14.761
Grace, enough with the attitude.

02:14.844 --> 02:16.679
You're going to your mother's ceremony
and that's it.

02:16.846 --> 02:19.098
No, that's okay.
Grace can do what she wants.

02:19.182 --> 02:22.227
- It's her choice.
- If it's my choice, then I'm not going.

02:29.776 --> 02:31.361
Officer Verelli.

02:34.405 --> 02:35.406
Your phone broken?

02:35.490 --> 02:36.533
What are you doing here?

02:37.075 --> 02:40.036
I don't know. I figure you get to visit me
at work, I thought maybe...

02:40.119 --> 02:41.120
Yeah, not a good time.

02:42.664 --> 02:45.124
Look, you know this is
an important day for me.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.751
Can I not have this hanging over my head?

02:46.835 --> 02:47.961
Yeah, God forbid.

02:48.044 --> 02:49.546
You just turn it off, just like that?

02:49.629 --> 02:52.799
I'm the one that said, "I love you,"
took a big step forward.

02:52.882 --> 02:53.967
Now I've got to take a step back.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.593
Why are you making this so difficult?

02:56.010 --> 02:57.887
You're the one that's making it difficult,
believe me.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.973
It's a lot easier dating 23-year-olds.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.975
- Fuck you.
- That's good.

03:02.058 --> 03:03.393
That's beautiful, honey.

03:03.476 --> 03:05.812
Thank you so much for coming all the way
down here to tell me that.

03:07.730 --> 03:08.731
Look, I've got work to do.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.612
What did you think of the gift I sent over?

03:15.905 --> 03:17.198
Loved it.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.870
You know what? We're done here.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.670
Normal respiration. BP's okay.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.255
Sir, why are you here?

03:32.338 --> 03:33.590
I'm dying.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.135
Do we have a history?

03:37.260 --> 03:40.346
I'm a gay man in New York City

03:40.430 --> 03:42.515
who managed to get old.

03:42.974 --> 03:44.934
How's that for a history?

03:45.643 --> 03:47.437
Intake says advanced liver cancer.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.946
This guy doesn't need an ER.
He needs a hospice.

03:57.030 --> 04:01.034
You know that. We can't justify
keeping him here to Akalitus.

04:02.619 --> 04:05.163
Sir, do you have any nausea?
Do you have a rash? Anything?

04:05.580 --> 04:06.581
No.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.750
But I've got pain.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.668
How much on a scale of one to 10?

04:10.752 --> 04:12.962
It only goes to 10?

04:17.008 --> 04:18.718
Okay, let's get the patient comfortable.

04:18.801 --> 04:21.262
Start IV hydration.
I'll write a script for morphine.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.142
You look very familiar to me, Wally.

04:26.976 --> 04:28.311
So do you.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.355
Oh, my God. Don't Tell Mama.

04:30.688 --> 04:32.690
It's a piano bar in Hell's Kitchen.

04:32.774 --> 04:34.525
You always sing Cole Porter.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.612
<i>And you're Bill in Show Boat.</i>

04:38.029 --> 04:39.364
You remember my song.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.824
I remember your head

04:41.908 --> 04:44.869
getting tangled in the overhead lights.

04:44.953 --> 04:47.288
That was... Oh, God.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.624
All right,
I'll be right back with your morphine.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.167
No morphine.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.502
It'll really help the pain.

04:52.585 --> 04:55.338
No painkillers. I'm...

04:56.047 --> 04:57.548
I'm in recovery.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.765
- Lidocaine.
- Right away, Doctor.

05:12.939 --> 05:14.565
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

05:20.196 --> 05:21.572
Butterflies?

05:23.199 --> 05:24.575
A few.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.786
Who wouldn't?

05:34.502 --> 05:37.463
Wait. Okay.

05:37.547 --> 05:38.589
You want to tell me what's going on?

05:38.881 --> 05:41.092
Your butterfly flirtation.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.261
- Not appreciated.
- Okay, I got it.

05:44.053 --> 05:45.430
Here's the thing, okay?

05:45.722 --> 05:48.391
One sure way of letting everybody know
what's going on between us

05:48.474 --> 05:49.892
is to start acting all formal.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.854
All right? Now, I'm just saying,

05:52.937 --> 05:55.481
I don't want you acting like somebody else.

05:56.232 --> 05:57.608
'Cause that would be a bad thing.

05:59.736 --> 06:01.154
Fine.

06:01.654 --> 06:03.114
Just be cool.

06:05.116 --> 06:07.076
I'm walking away first.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.672
Can you believe this?

06:22.925 --> 06:23.926
No comment.

06:26.262 --> 06:28.014
Really?

06:29.515 --> 06:34.228
Bread in the shape of a horseshoe
and you have no comment?

06:37.315 --> 06:38.775
I understand after yesterday

06:38.858 --> 06:42.820
if you want to take back your invitation
to your one-year celebration.

06:42.945 --> 06:44.280
No, I don't want that.

06:46.157 --> 06:48.201
Then you need to apologize to me.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.539
Zoey, I had just found out
that my kid is using drugs.

06:53.623 --> 06:55.500
You will excuse me
if I was a little fucked up.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.628
You still have to apologize.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.929
One day you're gonna have a kid,

07:10.098 --> 07:12.308
and if you're really lucky,
you're gonna have someone like you

07:12.391 --> 07:14.894
who gets really close to your kid.

07:16.521 --> 07:17.897
I am sorry.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.527
You have to be there this afternoon.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.657
Don't cry, we're at work.

07:32.745 --> 07:35.832
Just heard I've got a peer review today

07:35.998 --> 07:37.208
with Prentiss and Akalitus.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.417
And me.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.669
Is that a good thing?

07:39.752 --> 07:41.420
Since we're no longer together,

07:41.504 --> 07:43.506
I have a much clearer perspective
on your performance.

07:43.714 --> 07:46.259
Okay. Is that a good thing?

07:46.884 --> 07:48.636
Peer reviews can be life changing.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.013
Every doctor here went through it
as a resident.

07:51.848 --> 07:54.183
- And?
- Some got to stay.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.185
Shit.

07:57.436 --> 07:59.188
I so would not have worn this outfit

07:59.856 --> 08:02.024
if I'd known I'd be standing in front
of you guys today.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.657
Grace's blood shows minimal
trace amounts of Adderall.

08:09.824 --> 08:11.868
Basic teenage starter kit stuff.

08:12.618 --> 08:13.953
You must be so proud.

08:16.956 --> 08:19.375
I'm just trying to lighten things up.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.169
Yeah, comedy's about timing.

08:21.252 --> 08:22.670
This timing's not so good.

08:22.753 --> 08:23.921
Yeah.

08:24.005 --> 08:25.798
About this afternoon.

08:25.882 --> 08:27.842
If it's all the same to you,
I'm not gonna make it.

08:30.386 --> 08:32.805
All right. Do what you like.

08:33.264 --> 08:35.266
Yeah, maybe a little less 'tude.

08:35.850 --> 08:39.478
When a 14-year-old asks me
if I'm screwing her mom,

08:39.562 --> 08:40.730
I kind of need a minute.

08:40.897 --> 08:43.816
Can any part of you be nice
to any part of me today?

08:44.233 --> 08:46.777
It's not my job to make things nice for you.

08:47.111 --> 08:51.407
I give you work advice, relationship advice,
do homework with your kid.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.868
Exactly when did I become your girlfriend?

08:59.415 --> 09:01.167
Hey, Frank. It's Jackie.

09:01.250 --> 09:06.005
I guess you're taking
a bite out of crime, huh?

09:07.590 --> 09:09.550
Can you do me a favor and call me, please?

09:09.634 --> 09:10.843
Thanks.

09:13.346 --> 09:15.598
- How's Wally?
- Only in pure agony.

09:16.933 --> 09:18.267
You know what I'm gonna ask, right?

09:18.851 --> 09:21.062
He's dying. Everybody in his life is gone.

09:21.145 --> 09:24.232
Would you like me to take time off?
I could do hospice at his apartment.

09:24.315 --> 09:27.360
Absolutely not, but he can't be
taking up space in the ER.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.114
There's room in ICU.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.033
And privacy.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.245
Let's make him comfortable there.

09:42.792 --> 09:45.962
Anyone ever tell you
that you have a beautiful singing voice?

09:47.046 --> 09:50.466
When it's last call at Don't Tell Mama,

09:51.592 --> 09:54.929
everyone has a beautiful singing voice.

09:59.350 --> 10:02.144
Now, you know we could make you
more comfortable?

10:03.688 --> 10:05.982
Twenty-two years sober.

10:07.358 --> 10:09.986
That may not mean anything to you,

10:11.028 --> 10:13.155
but I'm not giving in now.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.825
No, I sort of get it.

10:19.829 --> 10:20.955
But if you change your mind.

10:21.497 --> 10:23.374
I won't.

10:23.833 --> 10:25.501
So don't ask.

10:34.260 --> 10:37.054
The Infant Jesus of Prague.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.472
Know your saints, do you?

10:39.015 --> 10:41.600
May even be meeting them soon.

10:43.728 --> 10:46.439
I used to wear a St. Christopher

10:47.398 --> 10:50.359
till they kicked him out of the Hall of Fame.

10:53.279 --> 10:54.989
Things change.

10:56.449 --> 10:59.535
I think of all the Big Macs I could have
eaten on Friday instead of fish sticks.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.205
You still go to mass?

11:05.374 --> 11:07.126
No, not so much.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.714
You leave the church.

11:13.174 --> 11:14.800
It never leaves you.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.641
Commonly,
when reviewing first-year residents,

11:22.725 --> 11:26.896
the first months bring
both good and not so good experiences.

11:27.396 --> 11:28.731
Thank you.

11:31.609 --> 11:34.612
Before we vote if your residency

11:34.695 --> 11:37.907
will continue at All Saints,
we'd like to hear from one more voice.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.241
Jackie?

11:39.325 --> 11:41.660
I worry every time you get near a patient.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.537
You worry? You know how I feel?

11:46.082 --> 11:47.625
Scared.

11:48.584 --> 11:49.585
All the time.

11:50.294 --> 11:53.798
I'm totally freaked
that the teeniest procedure I perform,

11:53.881 --> 11:55.466
I'm gonna kill someone.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.301
You did almost kill someone.

11:58.803 --> 12:00.137
I know what to do.

12:01.097 --> 12:02.431
I'm trained. lam.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.434
But I need confidence.

12:05.935 --> 12:08.187
And I'm trying to get better at it.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.563
I'm learning.

12:12.108 --> 12:13.692
I need a chance.

12:24.203 --> 12:25.454
Would you mind?

12:25.621 --> 12:27.248
I couldn't. We're in a meeting.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.374
Off!

12:29.250 --> 12:30.543
Can we just do this?

12:30.793 --> 12:32.253
- All in favor?
- Wait.

12:36.632 --> 12:40.052
Who here first time touching a patient
wasn't scared shitless?

12:40.136 --> 12:41.762
Except you, Ike.

12:42.263 --> 12:46.142
The worst you can say about Dr. Roman
is that she almost killed a patient.

12:46.684 --> 12:49.145
I did kill a patient and we never talk about it.

12:49.854 --> 12:53.399
Look around.
Dr. Prentiss, you did time for dealing.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.485
Gloria, you recently had memory issues.

12:56.944 --> 13:00.114
Jackie, you were a drug addict
treating patients.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.243
We all make mistakes.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.541
- I vote she stays.
- Opposed?

13:12.626 --> 13:15.337
I'm sorry, Dr. Roman.
We are dismissing you from All Saints.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.307
Hi, sweetie. How are you feeling?

13:27.266 --> 13:32.313
It's weird. I actually started feeling better.

13:37.193 --> 13:38.194
Thor!

13:40.779 --> 13:43.782
Against his wishes,
you administered morphine to an addict?

13:43.866 --> 13:45.826
And what,
he's gonna be hooked the rest of his life?

13:46.035 --> 13:47.203
Don't you be fucking smart.

13:47.286 --> 13:50.206
Excuse me, Jackie.
Not everybody is getting a cake today.

13:50.289 --> 13:51.749
Some people need relief from suffering.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.667
You don't get to make that choice.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.551
Dr. Roman.

14:03.344 --> 14:05.679
Big of you to come say goodbye.

14:08.182 --> 14:11.894
I've had some time to think about
the conditions that I've had to work under.

14:13.229 --> 14:18.901
On reflection, I believe that
I've been asked to perform in a

14:21.028 --> 14:22.488
hostile work environment.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.867
My immediate supervisor, Dr. Cooper,

14:27.368 --> 14:30.412
groped my breast in a public area,

14:30.829 --> 14:35.084
then had sex with me in my workplace.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.629
And, as I understand,

14:38.712 --> 14:43.926
you yourself hid a mental incapacity
that prevented my adequate supervision.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.012
- Who the hell are you?
- Brandon Hall.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.557
Stern, Goodman, and Kearns.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.517
Are you her attorney?

14:52.226 --> 14:54.103
Not yet.

14:54.937 --> 14:55.938
Should he be?

15:00.276 --> 15:01.569
Are you shitting me?

15:01.652 --> 15:03.696
Please, I came here for privacy.
A little decorum.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.656
Jesus Christ...

15:07.866 --> 15:09.285
So you're keeping her?

15:10.578 --> 15:14.623
Our choice is to keep her
or have our laundry hung out in court.

15:14.707 --> 15:16.166
No, I'm clean, so I say we go to court.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.170
Shit.

15:20.838 --> 15:24.800
Blame Dr. Cooper. This is what happens
when doctors have sexual relations at work.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.143
Remember your car accident?

15:34.435 --> 15:37.896
I do. I prescribed oxy for you,
and you're a drug addict.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.274
You didn't tell me.

15:41.150 --> 15:42.818
I would never have filled it.

15:44.403 --> 15:47.031
Take it. I wouldn't want your conscience
keeping you up at night.

15:47.740 --> 15:48.741
Jackie.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.452
I just want you to like me.

15:51.785 --> 15:52.995
Do better.

16:06.175 --> 16:07.509
It's been feeling a little weird over here.

16:07.635 --> 16:10.179
Later, at your meeting, more of this.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.557
From me, Fiona, Grace.

16:13.641 --> 16:15.392
Grace is not coming.

16:23.525 --> 16:24.693
He's in a lot of pain.

16:25.069 --> 16:27.321
Time to increase the morphine.

16:30.783 --> 16:33.160
Did he say

16:33.410 --> 16:35.120
I'm on morphine?

16:38.540 --> 16:40.709
I'd like more, please.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.976
Is there anything else
we can do for you, Wally?

16:58.060 --> 17:01.480
Yes. I'd like last rites.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.441
Okay. I'll get the chaplain.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.735
I'd prefer it

17:07.403 --> 17:09.488
if you would do the honors.

17:09.697 --> 17:11.740
Me? I'm not a priest.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.786
The church

17:15.869 --> 17:18.330
never leaves you, Jackie.

17:25.713 --> 17:26.880
Get in. Now.

17:34.763 --> 17:35.889
You don't drive.

17:36.598 --> 17:37.891
I know.

17:45.816 --> 17:49.027
This is going to make your mom so happy.

17:51.864 --> 17:55.617
I know I sort of had to kidnap you,

17:55.701 --> 17:59.621
but someday you'll look back
and be proud of doing this for her.

18:01.790 --> 18:05.878
Why are we always talking about her?
It's always about her.

18:06.754 --> 18:08.255
I want to go home.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.339
Okay.

18:11.842 --> 18:15.471
Hold on. I'll pull over,

18:16.472 --> 18:20.350
so you can freak out

18:20.434 --> 18:21.643
and have my full attention.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.395
Okay.

18:24.188 --> 18:25.564
No,don't.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.910
Do we have to go to my mom's thing?

18:41.705 --> 18:43.832
Not if you don't want to.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.007
Thank you.

18:53.801 --> 18:55.761
That's as high as we go.

18:57.429 --> 18:59.640
You're gonna start to get all floaty.

19:00.224 --> 19:02.434
Feel really good

19:02.518 --> 19:04.269
and probably sleep.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.775
May I say something?

19:10.692 --> 19:14.071
We only just met, formally anyway,

19:14.738 --> 19:19.701
but I want you to know what an example
you are to me.

19:21.829 --> 19:25.290
You are not just a survivor,

19:25.374 --> 19:28.794
you have survived it all so elegantly.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.880
The closet.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.091
Stonewall. The plague.

19:34.716 --> 19:35.884
Disco.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.934
I am honored to be with you now.

19:45.686 --> 19:49.273
Sing one for me

19:51.400 --> 19:52.776
at Mama's.

20:21.930 --> 20:27.102
"Lord, we call upon you to accept the soul
of Wallace into your kingdom.

20:29.688 --> 20:34.359
"Through this holy unction
and the goodness of his mercy,

20:34.443 --> 20:40.449
"may God pardon thee whatever sins thou
hast committed by evil use of sight,

20:44.244 --> 20:45.996
"of hearing,

20:48.999 --> 20:51.126
"of touch,

20:53.045 --> 20:54.630
"of speech,

20:58.967 --> 21:00.594
"and of taste.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.603
"I call upon thee as...

21:14.149 --> 21:17.486
"As a servant of Jesus Christ to

21:21.907 --> 21:26.328
"sanctify our actions in
the fulfillment of the will of God."

21:28.372 --> 21:29.831
- Amen.
- Amen.

21:30.874 --> 21:31.875
Amen.

21:43.053 --> 21:44.972
It's been a year today.

21:45.847 --> 21:47.683
But nothing changes.

21:49.685 --> 21:51.353
Everything I did, all of it.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.983
It never goes away, does it?

22:03.532 --> 22:05.993
I'm gonna have to ask you to pull over,
so I can pat you down.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.244
<i>You can save your "yokes.</i>

22:08.870 --> 22:10.247
And by the way, I'm not 23,

22:10.330 --> 22:12.165
so you don't have to
break up with me in person.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.209
Jackie.

22:15.544 --> 22:17.504
Jackie, come on.

22:18.296 --> 22:20.465
I never should have said that.

22:21.550 --> 22:23.677
Never should have said it, okay?

22:23.802 --> 22:25.012
About the 23-year-olds.

22:25.095 --> 22:27.097
Look, all I said was it's easier, okay?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.181
It sure as hell ain't better,

22:28.265 --> 22:29.850
it ain't what I want,
and it ain't what I'm doing.

22:29.933 --> 22:31.018
So this is you apologizing?

22:31.101 --> 22:33.770
No, why does everything got to be
a fucking mea <i>culpa</i> with you?

22:33.854 --> 22:35.439
It's always like a goddamn opera.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.816
Why can't we have a conversation
like normal fucking people?

22:37.899 --> 22:41.486
Normal? I'm a drug addict
who just gave up custody of her two kids.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.197
You gave up the girls?

22:44.281 --> 22:46.074
Grace is using drugs.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.286
Shit.

22:51.997 --> 22:54.791
- Jack, I didn't know.
- Yeah, answer your fucking phone.

22:55.917 --> 22:56.918
Yeah.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.838
Yeah, you're right.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.549
I'm sorry.

23:03.216 --> 23:04.718
So that was an apology?

23:08.764 --> 23:11.975
You know I can be pissed at you
and still love you, right?

23:19.816 --> 23:21.568
<i>It's quarter to 3:00</i>

23:23.487 --> 23:28.784
<i>There's no one in the place
Except you and me</i>

23:33.622 --> 23:35.415
<i>So set 'em up, Joe</i>

23:37.292 --> 23:42.005
<i>I got a little story you ought to know</i>

23:47.844 --> 23:50.722
<i>We're drinking, my friend</i>

23:51.932 --> 23:57.270
<i>To the end of a brief episode</i>

24:00.440 --> 24:03.819
<i>Make it one for my baby</i>

24:05.278 --> 24:10.784
<i>And one more for the road</i>

24:14.663 --> 24:17.290
I've never had to take off
a man's bulletproof vest before.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.876
That's the beauty of Velcro.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.675
- All right, so.
- Yeah?

24:28.343 --> 24:29.636
What was with the bread?

24:32.013 --> 24:34.474
You finally fucking opened it, huh?

24:35.475 --> 24:38.728
Okay, was that the dumbest gift
you've ever gotten?

24:40.230 --> 24:42.190
That is a family tradition.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.235
When something good happens to us,

24:45.360 --> 24:47.154
we make horseshoe bread.

24:48.071 --> 24:50.824
See, that way, our luck doesn't run out.

24:53.702 --> 24:55.120
Who are you?

24:57.706 --> 25:00.125
I'm a guy who's done some stuff right

25:00.208 --> 25:01.835
and some stuff wrong.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.713
Trust me, right's a lot better.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.549
And you...

25:09.968 --> 25:13.096
You are what's right, Jackie Peyton.

25:20.103 --> 25:21.479
I love you.

25:23.857 --> 25:24.858
Yeah?

25:26.276 --> 25:27.736
Well...

25:30.363 --> 25:32.240
How could you not?

25:43.835 --> 25:44.836
Okay.

25:46.087 --> 25:49.549
I'm gonna see you at your thing later,
all right?

25:52.844 --> 25:55.180
You know, I'm very proud of you.

26:06.399 --> 26:07.400
Okay.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.823
<i>So thanks for the cheer</i>

26:15.450 --> 26:17.869
<i>I hope you didn't mind me</i>

26:17.953 --> 26:21.456
<i>Bending your ear</i>

26:25.168 --> 26:28.505
<i>This torch that I've found</i>

26:28.588 --> 26:31.424
<i>Has got to be drowned</i>

26:31.508 --> 26:35.971
<i>For it soon will explode</i>

26:38.473 --> 26:41.851
<i>Make it one for my baby</i>

26:43.436 --> 26:47.816
<i>And one more for the road</i>

26:49.317 --> 26:51.987
<i>The long</i>

26:52.821 --> 26:56.157
<i>Long</i>

26:57.158 --> 27:01.496
<i>Road</i>

27:12.882 --> 27:17.178
<i>Happy anniversary to you</i>

27:17.470 --> 27:21.474
<i>Happy anniversary to you</i>

27:21.599 --> 27:26.604
<i>Happy anniversary, dear Jackie</i>

27:26.980 --> 27:32.444
<i>Happy anniversary to you</i>

27:55.592 --> 27:57.927
Hi, my name is Jackie and I am...

28:03.224 --> 28:06.144
I am an addict and...

28:10.315 --> 28:13.568
Today I am sober for one year.
