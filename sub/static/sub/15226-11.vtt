01:21.780 --> 01:23.515
Hey, hey, Jim?
                          Yo.

01:24.583 --> 01:26.050
You didn't get
coffee?
                    Huh? No.

01:26.084 --> 01:27.752
Machine must
be jammed again.

01:27.786 --> 01:29.220
Let me give you
a hand.

01:29.254 --> 01:30.221
Excuse me.

01:30.255 --> 01:31.857
(grunting)
         Hey.

01:31.891 --> 01:33.024
Tony, Tony, Tony!

01:33.059 --> 01:35.026
Pounding on it
              is not gonna help.

01:49.408 --> 01:53.512
Oh, is the coffee that bad
this morning?

01:53.546 --> 01:55.413
No. The coffee machine's broken.

01:55.447 --> 01:57.215
Why don't you get a screwdriver?

01:57.249 --> 01:59.050
Hey, that would
hit the spot.

02:02.555 --> 02:04.656
Which of the machines
has that?

02:04.690 --> 02:06.257
No, no, no, Jim,

02:06.259 --> 02:08.393
she means a screwdriver
      to open the machine.

02:08.426 --> 02:10.228
JIM:
                             Oh.
        I'll get one out
       of the tool room.

02:10.262 --> 02:13.197
Hey, how come this is locked?

02:13.266 --> 02:15.167
Louie says it's off-limits.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.035
The tool room is off-limits now?

02:17.069 --> 02:18.269
Yeah.

02:18.304 --> 02:22.207
And I'm not supposed to tell why
        no matter what.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.077
You mean he's hiding
             something in there?

02:27.512 --> 02:30.515
Louie'll kill me, but he's
storing food in there.

02:30.549 --> 02:31.583
Food?

02:31.617 --> 02:33.050
Yeah.
                     Why?

02:33.119 --> 02:35.887
Uh, well, he thinks the end
     of the world's coming,

02:35.921 --> 02:38.890
so he's turning the room
       into a-a shelter.

02:38.924 --> 02:42.027
Louie's determined
          to survive.

02:42.061 --> 02:43.995
I wish he'd put it
                   up to a vote.

02:44.029 --> 02:45.297
Yeah.

02:48.734 --> 02:50.969
What's that?

02:51.003 --> 02:53.771
What's what?

02:53.806 --> 02:55.707
What's in the barrel?

02:55.741 --> 02:57.609
My lunch.

03:01.446 --> 03:03.548
A lunch
                       of wheat?

03:03.582 --> 03:06.184
You get tired of salami.

03:08.053 --> 03:09.620
Louie, why are
                        you, uh,

03:09.655 --> 03:11.990
suddenly preparing for
           the end of the world?

03:12.024 --> 03:13.791
You know something
                       we don't?

03:17.463 --> 03:19.397
Judas!

03:23.469 --> 03:25.437
All right,
        I got this idea

03:25.471 --> 03:27.806
while I was watching
    <i>TheDonahue</i> <i>Show</i> one day.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.807
He had a guy on there

03:29.842 --> 03:31.842
who was saying where
      the world was going

03:31.877 --> 03:34.478
and what we had to do
     to protect ourselves.

03:34.513 --> 03:37.481
And let me tell you something,
 he scared the hell out of me.

03:37.516 --> 03:39.383
And you know who else he scared?

03:39.417 --> 03:40.518
Donahue.

03:40.586 --> 03:43.455
Donahue?

03:43.489 --> 03:46.324
Donahue's not a-scared
                    of anything.

03:46.358 --> 03:47.892
Well, he's scared of this.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.360
JIM:
                             No.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.730
You know that special twinkle
      he's got in his eye?

03:51.764 --> 03:53.732
JIM: Yeah.
       Well, it was gone,

03:53.766 --> 03:55.967
as gone as your brain.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.103
What are you worried about,
             Louie?

03:58.137 --> 04:00.405
I'm worried about everything,
             Banta.

04:00.439 --> 04:02.807
I'm worried about, uh,
        about inflation,

04:02.842 --> 04:04.876
destroying the economy,

04:04.910 --> 04:06.878
about, uh, murderers

04:06.912 --> 04:08.746
running loose
in the streets,

04:08.814 --> 04:10.648
about criminals controlling
          the cities,

04:10.683 --> 04:13.651
politicians hamstringing
          the police,

04:13.686 --> 04:16.320
nuclear holocaust, epidemic,

04:16.353 --> 04:18.322
class warfare,

04:18.356 --> 04:20.625
an end of the world
         as we know it.

04:20.659 --> 04:23.528
Oh, boo hoo.

04:23.562 --> 04:25.796
You gotta learn to take the bad

04:25.830 --> 04:27.932
with the good, boss.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.800
Well, thanks, Confucius.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.505
Louie, come on, if that
                 were to happen,

04:33.539 --> 04:35.239
then no one
                  would survive.

04:36.075 --> 04:38.076
Oh, yeah?

04:38.110 --> 04:40.078
Someone would.

04:40.112 --> 04:42.046
Come with me.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.925
Welcome to Louie's Doom Room.

04:55.728 --> 04:58.096
I've been doing
a lot of studying.

04:58.098 --> 05:01.399
This garage was built
        back in the days

05:01.433 --> 05:03.401
when they knew
    how to build buildings.

05:03.435 --> 05:05.503
I mean, back in the days
         when they used

05:05.538 --> 05:08.740
good Irish
     and Italian laborers,

05:08.774 --> 05:10.842
not these foreigners
         they got now.

05:12.745 --> 05:16.081
All right,
       up here by Nardo,

05:16.115 --> 05:17.682
my food supply:

05:17.717 --> 05:21.519
freeze-dried,
      dehydrated goodies.

05:21.553 --> 05:25.323
My water purifier,
        my grain mill...

05:25.357 --> 05:27.291
Look at this, huh?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.361
Over here?

05:30.395 --> 05:32.964
My generator
        for electricity.

05:32.998 --> 05:34.132
And there?

05:36.102 --> 05:38.235
My radiation-proof suits.

05:39.571 --> 05:42.407
Louie, this must have
      cost you a fortune.

05:42.441 --> 05:44.375
What good is money
      in the bank, Nardo,

05:44.409 --> 05:46.311
when you're
     a radioactive pretzel?

05:47.880 --> 05:50.247
Hey, Lou, how come
       you got four cots?

05:50.282 --> 05:51.582
You don't think
    that I'm gonna

05:51.617 --> 05:53.617
come in here
    alone, do you?

05:53.652 --> 05:56.287
I've picked a survival squad
         to be with me.

05:56.321 --> 05:57.288
ALEX:
                           Oh...

05:57.322 --> 05:59.690
First of all, there's Jeff.

06:01.593 --> 06:05.196
I need him to convince
the black hordes I'm cool.

06:07.132 --> 06:09.066
I'll do what I can.

06:12.604 --> 06:16.373
Oh, then, of course,
      there's Nardo's cot.

06:18.610 --> 06:20.611
You wasted
your money, Louie.

06:20.645 --> 06:23.047
Nardo, shh.

06:23.081 --> 06:26.184
Don't bother
             to deny me on this.

06:26.218 --> 06:29.386
When the day comes,
              you'll be knocking
                   on that door.

06:29.421 --> 06:33.424
When you're up to your
          pretty, dimpled cheeks
                      in rubble,

06:33.458 --> 06:35.660
and I'll be
                in here waiting.

06:35.694 --> 06:38.262
Just so we know
                  that it's you,

06:38.296 --> 06:40.264
here's the password.

06:43.035 --> 06:44.902
That's disgusting!

06:46.304 --> 06:48.339
But memorable.

06:48.373 --> 06:50.808
It'll be our little
               love call, Nardo.

06:50.842 --> 06:53.678
Louie, if you
and I were the last
man and woman on Earth,

06:53.712 --> 06:57.481
we'd be the last man
and woman on Earth.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.783
So let me see,
                    there's, um,

06:59.818 --> 07:02.854
there's you and Jeff
and Elaine, right?

07:02.888 --> 07:05.890
But when the holocaust comes,
who's gonna be the, uh,

07:05.924 --> 07:07.624
fourth member
of your survival squad?

07:07.693 --> 07:09.794
Were you thinking of me, boss?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.504
Yes, Iggy, I was thinking
           of you...

07:20.538 --> 07:24.175
the last time I stepped
  on a snail in my bare feet.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.512
Please, boss,
        let me join in.

07:27.546 --> 07:30.181
All this talk has got me scared.

07:30.216 --> 07:32.116
I don't want to die.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.919
Trust me, Iggy, you'll never
      know the difference.

07:34.921 --> 07:37.621
All right, come on,
                  everybody out.

07:39.524 --> 07:41.459
Out, out, out,
      out, out, out, out!

07:44.963 --> 07:47.331
So, uh...

07:47.366 --> 07:48.533
who is the fourth member?

07:48.535 --> 07:49.867
I bet I know.

07:49.902 --> 07:50.935
You're gonna take Alex.

07:50.937 --> 07:54.038
Well, I was
thinking of Reiger.

07:54.072 --> 07:57.041
But it wouldn't work,
    because he'd vie with me

07:57.075 --> 07:59.210
for leadership of the group.

07:59.244 --> 08:02.146
Besides, he'd use up
                too much oxygen.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.514
(inhales deeply)

08:05.751 --> 08:09.053
Ah, the fourth man I picked

08:09.088 --> 08:13.257
is a very important cog
         in my machine.

08:14.493 --> 08:17.728
I needed an enforcer.

08:17.762 --> 08:21.499
Somebody who would respond
      to my every command.

08:21.533 --> 08:24.469
Someone with a lot of muscle,

08:24.503 --> 08:28.072
and a single-digit I.Q.

08:28.107 --> 08:29.540
Yeah, well just
forget about him.

08:29.574 --> 08:31.209
He's not interested
in this stuff.

08:31.243 --> 08:32.443
I wouldn't count on him, Louie.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.279
No way, Louie.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.080
Who we talking about?

08:37.816 --> 08:39.484
I think he means you, Tony.

08:39.518 --> 08:41.719
Get out of here.

08:47.292 --> 08:48.459
You want me, Louie?

08:48.493 --> 08:50.127
You bet I do, Banta.

08:50.162 --> 08:52.529
You know what
                 New York City's
             like when it rains?

08:52.564 --> 08:54.332
People will kill each
                other for a cab.

08:54.366 --> 08:57.835
Imagine what it would be
      like if disaster hit here.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.771
This city would be
                  a combat zone.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.707
You had experience
                     in Vietnam.

09:02.741 --> 09:03.941
Yeah, I did.

09:03.975 --> 09:07.445
Take two or three weeks
         and read this pamphlet.

09:07.479 --> 09:08.813
It'll fill ya in.

09:08.847 --> 09:10.348
"Heading for Armageddon."

09:10.382 --> 09:12.784
The guy is
              a terrific writer.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.687
Look, uh, keep your
nightmares to yourself, Lou.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.355
I think it's about
time we go to Mario's.

09:17.389 --> 09:18.456
Come on.
                         ELAINE:
                       Oh, yeah.

09:18.490 --> 09:20.057
All right, wait a minute,
wait a minute, now.

09:20.091 --> 09:21.759
Let everybody shut up,

09:21.793 --> 09:24.428
and let's hear
     what Banta has to say.

09:24.462 --> 09:26.663
Let him decide for himself.

09:26.665 --> 09:27.798
All right, fine.
           Go ahead.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.066
Go ahead, Tony.
              Go on, tell him.

09:29.101 --> 09:30.835
Tell him what you think
  of his ghoulish little, uh,

09:30.869 --> 09:34.038
morbid cynical,
   little plan for doomsday.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.939
I think it
sounds like fun.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.811
That's my boy. Here.

09:39.845 --> 09:40.978
Read, read, read.

09:41.012 --> 09:42.613
It's got
pictures in there.

09:44.550 --> 09:46.351
You know, you guys don't know
      what you're talking about.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.252
You haven't got
                 an idea of what
           you're talking about.

09:48.286 --> 09:51.356
It's one thing
             to save up a lot of
      food and read scare books,

09:51.390 --> 09:53.725
but it's another thing
           to lock yourselves up
                      in a room.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.292
I don't think this
     little group of yours

09:55.326 --> 09:56.861
would last two days in there.

09:58.964 --> 10:00.665
Oh yeah, Reiger?

10:00.667 --> 10:02.033
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Is that what you think?

10:02.067 --> 10:03.567
Yeah, yeah.
       Yeah? Yeah, that's
     what you think? Yeah?!

10:03.602 --> 10:05.036
Yeah.
 Yeah, yeah! You do think that?

10:05.070 --> 10:06.904
Yeah.
     Yeah, well, I'm going
      to show you, Reiger.

10:06.938 --> 10:08.239
I'll show you what we can do.

10:08.273 --> 10:10.808
Your little speech here
      gave me a good idea.

10:10.842 --> 10:14.078
Our little group needs
          some field experience.

10:14.112 --> 10:15.480
All the books say

10:15.514 --> 10:16.847
you got to conduct drills.

10:16.881 --> 10:19.450
That is exactly
what I'm gonna do.

10:19.484 --> 10:21.219
My crack squad and I

10:21.253 --> 10:23.754
are gonna go in there
         for a weekend.

10:23.756 --> 10:26.190
We're gonna spend
       two days in there

10:26.224 --> 10:29.227
just as though a disaster
        had really hit.

10:29.261 --> 10:31.195
Just like maneuvers
       in the Army, Lou.

10:31.229 --> 10:32.529
That's a good idea!
That's right, Banta.

10:32.564 --> 10:33.630
Come here, Jeff.

10:33.665 --> 10:35.933
All right, so what
disaster is it gonna be?

10:35.967 --> 10:38.402
I don't know.

10:38.504 --> 10:40.838
How about civil rioting?

10:40.872 --> 10:42.039
That's not bad.

10:42.073 --> 10:44.741
Uh, but why don't we go
      for the atomic war?

10:44.743 --> 10:46.677
Hey, what about earthquake
        and pestilence?

10:46.745 --> 10:48.879
Oh, man, why fool around
with that small stuff?

10:48.914 --> 10:50.280
Let's go
for atomic war.

10:50.315 --> 10:51.849
Yeah, but earthquakes
                        are bad.

10:51.883 --> 10:53.517
All right, all right,
       hold it, hold it.

10:53.552 --> 10:55.819
All right, we'll do it all.

10:55.854 --> 10:58.022
It's an atomic blast

10:58.056 --> 11:01.625
that starts an earthquake,
   setting off civil rioting.

11:01.659 --> 11:03.194
All right? All right.

11:03.228 --> 11:04.895
Good, Lou.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.564
All right, we can throw
         pestilence in

11:06.598 --> 11:08.398
and stuff like that.
            All right, okay.

11:14.739 --> 11:15.706
Jeff?
                   Yeah.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.441
I'm ready.
        Where's Banta?

11:17.476 --> 11:19.577
He's on his way.
             Keys.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.481
Wait a minute,
         wait a minute.

11:23.515 --> 11:24.849
Lou, let me ask you a question.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.652
Have you thought this thing
      through really well?

11:27.686 --> 11:30.521
I mean, if you're
               gonna be in there
             with all that food,

11:30.555 --> 11:32.189
and everybody out
       here's gonna be starving,

11:32.223 --> 11:33.691
they're gonna be
         trying to get in there.

11:33.725 --> 11:35.993
And what if there
               was a little girl

11:36.027 --> 11:38.763
who hadn't had anything
                to eat for days?

11:38.797 --> 11:41.198
I mean some cute,
                     little, uh,

11:41.232 --> 11:42.667
freckle-faced girl,

11:42.701 --> 11:46.337
came, uh, weakly
           rapping at your door.

11:49.774 --> 11:51.976
Begging for a
                 morsel of food.

11:52.010 --> 11:54.478
What are you gonna
             do about that, huh?

11:54.513 --> 11:55.779
You gonna turn her away?

11:55.848 --> 11:57.581
Let me get this straight,
            Reiger.

11:59.050 --> 12:03.220
Are we talking about a,
   a little adorable muppet?

12:03.255 --> 12:07.625
Uh, you know, uh, say about
        eight years old,

12:07.659 --> 12:11.562
golden ringlets,
     just a hint of a lisp?

12:12.664 --> 12:14.098
Yeah, that's the one.

12:14.132 --> 12:16.066
But look, Reiger,

12:16.101 --> 12:18.502
it's survival of the fittest.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.705
I mean, there's no room
      for compassion here.

12:20.739 --> 12:24.375
I mean, if you're soft,
          you're dead.

12:24.409 --> 12:25.709
But, Louie, what about
               that little girl?

12:28.313 --> 12:29.747
She's buzzard bait.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.487
All right, Jeff,
           I'm ready.

12:36.521 --> 12:37.588
All right.

12:37.622 --> 12:39.056
Tony, that's
                   a great look.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.292
How do I go about getting
            an outfit like that?

12:41.326 --> 12:42.459
You enlist in the Army

12:42.494 --> 12:44.529
and you spend a year
    of your life in Vietnam.

12:44.563 --> 12:45.596
How about just the hat?

12:47.933 --> 12:50.034
Tony! Jeff!

12:50.068 --> 12:51.736
JEFF:
                           Yeah?
           Let's go.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.571
Now, now, let's
pay attention here.

12:53.605 --> 12:55.139
We got to do this right.

12:55.173 --> 12:56.741
We got to get organized.

12:56.775 --> 13:00.611
It is now 1:00
Friday afternoon.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.914
Lou, 1300 hours.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.649
Good, Banta.

13:05.684 --> 13:08.186
1300 hours,

13:08.220 --> 13:09.453
Friday afternoon.

13:09.488 --> 13:11.622
We are gonna go
   into that survival bunker

13:11.656 --> 13:13.657
and lock the door behind us.

13:13.691 --> 13:17.027
And under no conditions
      are we gonna emerge

13:17.062 --> 13:20.398
prior to 1600 hours, Sunday.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.499
Yeah.
                    All right.

13:22.533 --> 13:24.234
Now as far as
                we're concerned,

13:24.269 --> 13:28.071
the world out
                   here is gone.

13:28.106 --> 13:29.540
Are there any questions?

13:29.608 --> 13:31.541
Who played Lumpy
in <i>Leave It to Beaver?</i>

13:36.815 --> 13:40.618
We may look silly to you,
            Reiger,

13:40.652 --> 13:44.288
but we're doing something here
     that's very important.

13:44.322 --> 13:46.490
There are a lot of people
            who feel

13:46.525 --> 13:48.626
exactly the way I do.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.294
And if I'm crazy,

13:50.328 --> 13:52.696
then there are millions
      of people out there

13:52.731 --> 13:54.398
who are just as crazy as I am.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.335
Well, that makes me feel
         a lot better.

13:57.369 --> 13:59.936
All right,
are you ready?

13:59.971 --> 14:02.106
I'm ready, Louie.
       I guess.

14:02.140 --> 14:05.175
Okay, disaster has struck.

14:05.209 --> 14:07.311
Let's go to the survival bunker.

14:07.345 --> 14:10.047
All right, hey, Alex,
Elaine, have a nice weekend.

14:10.082 --> 14:11.448
ELAINE:
                            Bye.
ALEX:
Yeah, enjoy yourself.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.718
Say good-bye to the
            world as we know it.

14:13.752 --> 14:15.152
TONY & JEFF:
 Good-bye to the world as we...

14:15.186 --> 14:17.487
No, no, no--
               figure of speech.

14:18.590 --> 14:20.157
So long, losers.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.761
(door slams, locks latching)

14:23.795 --> 14:25.996
I just had
a terrifying thought.

14:26.030 --> 14:27.998
If the world were
to end tomorrow,

14:28.032 --> 14:29.600
that's what's left
of the human race.

14:31.703 --> 14:33.303
Man your stations.

15:06.338 --> 15:07.571
Hey, Louie?

15:07.605 --> 15:09.106
Ain't we supposed
     to be doing something?

15:09.174 --> 15:11.875
We are doing something, Banta.
        We're surviving.

15:18.783 --> 15:20.384
You want something to read?

15:20.452 --> 15:21.752
I'm still working
        on the pamphlet.

15:26.658 --> 15:28.592
Hey, how 'bout
     something to eat, Lou?

15:28.626 --> 15:30.794
That's a good idea.

15:30.862 --> 15:32.329
Here we go.

15:33.631 --> 15:38.069
A nice, big bowl of
       vitamin-enriched legumes.

15:41.639 --> 15:43.507
These here

15:43.542 --> 15:45.876
have the nutritional
           equivalent

15:45.910 --> 15:48.846
of an entire
         egg breakfast.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.716
What're we supposed
        to do with them?

15:51.750 --> 15:53.783
You eat them.

15:53.818 --> 15:55.318
Mmm!

15:55.387 --> 15:57.154
This is awful.

15:58.523 --> 16:00.624
Louie, ain't you
got anything

16:00.659 --> 16:03.394
that tastes good to eat
in this place?
             Yeah.

16:03.428 --> 16:05.763
There's some
freeze-dried ice cream.
         LOUIE: Nah-uh!

16:05.797 --> 16:08.231
Don't you dare touch that
          freeze-dried ice cream

16:08.266 --> 16:10.367
until you've finished
                   your legumes.

16:11.703 --> 16:12.937
Come on, Louie,
       let's eat some...

16:12.939 --> 16:14.271
Sit down!

16:14.305 --> 16:15.906
Eat!

16:15.941 --> 16:17.541
Hey, let's take
         a vote on it.

16:17.642 --> 16:20.076
Everybody for ice cream
        raise your hand.

16:24.249 --> 16:26.283
(grumbles)

16:30.889 --> 16:32.589
It's three
to one, Louie.

16:38.463 --> 16:41.098
Ignatowski, what the hell
          are you doing in here?

16:41.132 --> 16:43.434
I'm voting for ice cream.

16:43.468 --> 16:45.168
What are you doing
          in my survival bunker?

16:45.202 --> 16:46.437
You're not supposed
                     to be here.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.006
Oh, I've been living
in here for three days.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.142
Eating this great food,
listening to the short wave,

16:52.176 --> 16:54.611
reading all those books,

16:54.646 --> 16:56.947
and sleeping in these
crazy sleeping bags.

16:59.317 --> 17:01.618
Get the hell
       out of here, you.

17:01.652 --> 17:04.320
Come on.
       Oh, come on, boss.

17:04.355 --> 17:05.756
Let me stay.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.824
I'll be a good soldier.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.559
Iggy?
                            Huh?

17:09.594 --> 17:12.028
Your mind is mush.

17:12.063 --> 17:16.233
I haven't got the faculty
  of Harvard in here as it is.

17:16.267 --> 17:18.034
Come on now, you got to get
     out of here before...

17:18.069 --> 17:19.103
Oh, boss...

17:19.137 --> 17:22.172
Wait a minute!
                  Wait a minute!

17:22.205 --> 17:23.874
This is perfect!

17:23.876 --> 17:25.276
This is great!

17:25.310 --> 17:26.676
I'm glad you're here, Iggy.

17:26.711 --> 17:30.114
Thanks, boss,
      I'm glad to be here!

17:30.148 --> 17:31.481
Iggy?
Huh?

17:31.516 --> 17:34.184
You are gonna play
       an important part

17:34.218 --> 17:36.120
in my little survival group.

17:36.154 --> 17:37.788
Hey, you bet!

17:37.822 --> 17:39.089
What do you want me to do?

17:39.124 --> 17:40.524
What can I do for you, boss?

17:40.558 --> 17:42.059
All right, you just
                  stand there...
     Uh-huh.

17:42.093 --> 17:43.794
and let Banta throw you out.

17:43.828 --> 17:45.629
Can do.

17:45.663 --> 17:47.765
What are you
talking about, Louie?

17:47.799 --> 17:50.967
Look, Banta, we're
             simulating the real
                     thing here.

17:51.002 --> 17:53.169
That's why I got you
                   on the squad.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.840
Remove the invading
           anarchist.

17:55.874 --> 17:57.908
Come on, Louie,
         it's just Jim.

17:57.942 --> 17:58.942
It's not Jim.

17:58.977 --> 18:02.113
It's a starved maniac
        after your food.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.147
Hey, he could have
          my legumes.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.985
Will you get
                out of here?

18:08.019 --> 18:10.420
That is the enemy, Banta.

18:10.455 --> 18:12.022
He is threatening
           our lives.

18:12.056 --> 18:13.724
Now, get up and throw him
          out of here.

18:13.758 --> 18:15.259
Okay, come on, Jim,
         you got to go.

18:15.293 --> 18:16.593
It's just a drill
              anyway. Come on...

18:16.627 --> 18:19.496
No, no-- Banta,
      this is not a drill.

18:19.530 --> 18:22.165
You have to tell yourself
  that this is the real thing.

18:22.199 --> 18:24.735
Outside that door,

18:24.769 --> 18:27.738
there's a world
that's smoking,

18:27.772 --> 18:30.340
burning, glowing.

18:30.374 --> 18:32.943
There's nothing out there;
            no air,

18:32.977 --> 18:36.813
no water, no food,
just total devastation.

18:42.354 --> 18:44.221
You want me to throw
              him out into that?

18:44.255 --> 18:46.557
That's right. I want you
   to throw him out of there.

18:46.591 --> 18:48.091
If you can't do it now,

18:48.125 --> 18:50.627
then you'll never be able to do
  it and you're no use to me.

19:06.377 --> 19:08.311
I can't do it, Louie.

19:10.548 --> 19:13.383
Okay, coward,
I'll do it.

19:13.418 --> 19:14.851
I'll throw
Iggy out myself.

19:14.886 --> 19:16.420
No, no, don't do that, boss!

19:16.454 --> 19:18.588
I want to live.
 I want to stay here with you.

19:18.623 --> 19:19.756
I don't want to die.

19:19.790 --> 19:22.092
I'm sorry, Iggy.

19:22.126 --> 19:24.662
I mean, I...
     that's the way it is.

19:24.696 --> 19:28.231
It's a question of who's
   gonna survive, you or me?

19:28.266 --> 19:30.067
It can't be both of us.

19:30.101 --> 19:32.135
That's why I gotta
         throw you out.

19:32.169 --> 19:34.004
I understand.

19:35.272 --> 19:37.808
I don't want ya to die
           because of me.

19:37.842 --> 19:39.810
So long, boss.

19:39.844 --> 19:41.244
Good-bye.

19:45.049 --> 19:48.151
Could I ask just one
      more thing from you, boss?

19:48.185 --> 19:51.488
No food, no water,
no nothing.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.457
A hug?

19:59.864 --> 20:01.765
(grumbles)

20:09.974 --> 20:11.875
(sobbing)

20:24.388 --> 20:26.190
See, Louie?

20:26.224 --> 20:29.326
It's no fun pretending
               everybody's dead.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.595
What if you're not
    pretending, Banta?

20:31.629 --> 20:34.197
That won't be
            any fun either.

20:39.003 --> 20:41.638
You had to hug me.

20:41.673 --> 20:42.839
All right, forget it!

20:42.873 --> 20:44.475
The whole thing's called off.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.776
Let's go.
Don't go out there, boss!

20:49.647 --> 20:51.781
Will you get away
         from the door?

20:51.816 --> 20:54.751
There's nothing
but devastation
and death out there.

20:54.785 --> 20:55.986
Nobody and nothing.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.321
Hi, Alex.

20:57.355 --> 21:00.757
Well, an 11-minute Armageddon.

21:00.791 --> 21:02.692
Sort of an "Armageddonette."

21:04.562 --> 21:06.997
Come on, Jeff, I'll
                 buy you a beer.
I hear you.

21:07.032 --> 21:08.365
Hey, see you later.
                           Yeah.

21:08.399 --> 21:11.101
Oh, come on, Louie.

21:11.136 --> 21:13.003
It's not the end of the world.

21:15.273 --> 21:17.808
Real funny, Reiger.

21:17.842 --> 21:19.609
You see this?

21:19.643 --> 21:21.578
Dead man!

21:21.612 --> 21:23.146
What are you talking about?

21:25.550 --> 21:27.584
I was done in
by a soft heart.

21:28.886 --> 21:30.621
Whose?

21:32.323 --> 21:34.457
I couldn't throw
Ignatowski out of there.

21:34.492 --> 21:37.761
When it came right
down to it, I was soft.

21:39.029 --> 21:41.064
I'm a loser like you.

21:43.601 --> 21:45.202
When the end comes,

21:45.236 --> 21:48.972
I'll be nothing
   but a charcoal briquette.

21:49.974 --> 21:51.608
Oh, gee, what a shame.

21:53.044 --> 21:54.878
Now, you're just gonna
       have to take your chances

21:54.913 --> 21:57.280
with the rest of us.
Yeah.

21:59.150 --> 22:02.686
Hey, Louie, it's not
        gonna be what you think.

22:03.788 --> 22:05.589
You couldn't
                  throw Jim out.

22:05.623 --> 22:07.891
You couldn't turn
               your back on Jim.

22:07.925 --> 22:10.293
And if the time came,
      you wouldn't be able

22:10.327 --> 22:11.728
to turn your back
      on that little girl

22:11.763 --> 22:13.463
or anybody else
        for that matter.

22:13.497 --> 22:15.766
And that's where our hope is.

22:15.800 --> 22:20.170
Not in, uh, radiation suits
     and fallout shelters,

22:20.204 --> 22:22.338
but in compassion.

22:22.373 --> 22:25.375
If we don't give up
 on the future, we can make it.

22:26.644 --> 22:28.645
We don't have to be
             afraid of tomorrow.

22:28.679 --> 22:30.447
We can look forward to it.

22:37.321 --> 22:39.790
Did you say something, Reiger?

22:41.659 --> 22:43.359
Ah, no, no, no, no,

22:43.394 --> 22:44.828
I'm sorry,
I wasn't listening.

22:44.862 --> 22:46.964
no, no, no, no--
      you were listening.
I wasn't listening.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.564
You were listening.

22:48.599 --> 22:52.202
Don't sit there dripping
          with love for humanity

22:52.236 --> 22:55.606
and pretending
             you didn't hear me.

22:55.640 --> 22:59.375
You sweet, little
             tender rascal, you.

23:01.579 --> 23:03.013
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
           Hey, hey, hey, Louie.

23:03.047 --> 23:05.015
Louie, come on.
   Everybody went to Mario's.

23:05.049 --> 23:06.850
Come on,
     let me buy you a beer.

23:06.884 --> 23:08.652
Uh, maybe later.

23:12.623 --> 23:14.724
Hey, Reiger, wait up.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.331
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

23:33.878 --> 23:35.278
(theme song playing)

23:59.437 --> 24:00.904
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:00.938 --> 24:01.938
(man grumbling)

24:02.305 --> 24:08.682
