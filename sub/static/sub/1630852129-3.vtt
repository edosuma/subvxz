- Hey.
- Thank you.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.907
- I'ma be honest,
I didn't know what my decision

35:17.990 --> 35:20.493
was--I had no idea
this was even happening.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.578
Like, I didn't know
nothing about tonight.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.955
- I feel like none of us knew.

35:24.038 --> 35:25.706
- I'm telling you, nothing.

35:25.790 --> 35:29.585
So, literally,
it was like a last minute

35:29.669 --> 35:31.254
kind of decision.

35:31.337 --> 35:32.630
<i>- I feel shut down.</i>

35:32.713 --> 35:34.966
Would you honestly
rather have someone

35:35.049 --> 35:37.301
who just got here yesterday
get that overnight time

35:37.385 --> 35:39.178
rather than me?

35:39.262 --> 35:41.556
That's stupid.
That's, like, really silly.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.140
<i>That's how I feel.</i>

35:43.224 --> 35:45.268
I'm, like, hot.
- [laughs]

35:45.351 --> 35:47.186
- Stop showing off.
- Oh, my God.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.563
- [sighs heavily]

35:48.646 --> 35:50.273
- So are you guys excited
for your overnight?

35:50.356 --> 35:52.525
- I'm excited, but I'm like,
what's in it, you know?

35:52.608 --> 35:55.152
Where are we going?
- Are you guys gonna get spicy?

35:55.236 --> 35:56.904
- I feel like we got
a little spicy.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.323
[laughs]
You know, before?

36:00.783 --> 36:03.244
We'll see.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.787
- Let's keep it PG.

36:04.871 --> 36:07.498
- I'll do what I do,
and you can do what you do.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.876
However you feel, I mean...

36:10.918 --> 36:12.378
- You wanna join me?
- Yeah.

36:12.461 --> 36:13.713
- Let's do it.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.756
I'm not big on drama,
and it looks like

36:15.840 --> 36:17.717
<i>Nicci's triggering some drama.</i>

36:17.800 --> 36:19.802
- Dude, the fuck?
They're all catty.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.387
- Yeah, they are.

36:21.470 --> 36:23.139
I just wanted to extract myself
from that situation.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.932
Not a big fan of that.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.225
<i>This is a red flag.</i>

36:26.309 --> 36:28.060
I don't know
what Nicci's thinking.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.897
It wasn't a nice thing to say.
It definitely triggered Nicole.

36:30.980 --> 36:34.066
And I want to make sure that
I'm investing in someone

36:34.150 --> 36:37.236
who has a maturity level
and a graciousness,

36:37.320 --> 36:39.071
and now I'm sort of drawing
that into question

36:39.155 --> 36:40.781
based upon that comment.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.199
- Like,
what are you thinking now?

36:42.283 --> 36:43.534
- I don't know.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.250
<i>- For me,</i>
<i>if someone that I was dating</i>

36:51.334 --> 36:54.754
was kind of flaunting it in,
like, another person's face,

36:54.837 --> 36:56.380
I definitely would not be cool
with that.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.425
I would, like, shut that shit
down immediately.

36:59.508 --> 37:01.886
Over the head, down the shoot.

37:29.288 --> 37:31.791

37:31.874 --> 37:33.417
If you have real feelings
for someone,

37:33.501 --> 37:35.378
you don't want to see them
go off on, like,

37:35.461 --> 37:36.879
an overnight date
with somebody else.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.381

- Yeah.

37:38.464 --> 37:39.423

- Right.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.758

37:40.841 --> 37:41.884

37:41.968 --> 37:43.177

37:43.260 --> 37:44.929

37:45.012 --> 37:47.431

37:47.515 --> 37:49.475

real feelings.

37:49.558 --> 37:50.810

37:52.645 --> 37:54.146

37:54.230 --> 37:56.607

37:59.235 --> 38:00.820

38:00.903 --> 38:02.488
- You shouldn't feel stupid.

38:02.571 --> 38:04.031

Tom's all, like,

38:04.115 --> 38:05.324
<i>excited about this.</i>

38:05.408 --> 38:07.076

how you feel?

38:07.159 --> 38:10.204
- No, I--I feel like I can't
because I feel like an idiot.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.872
- You are just here
to find love.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.417
Is anybody else here?
- I know, but, like--

38:14.500 --> 38:16.711
- It's like, just because
you aren't a lead

38:16.794 --> 38:19.714
doesn't mean that, like,
you can't develop a connection.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.924
- [sighs]
I know.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.634
- You know?

<i>- So I'm definitely</i>
<i>interested in Tom,</i>

38:25.469 --> 38:27.930

about how I'm going to navigate

38:28.014 --> 38:31.058
this attraction because
we are here for Markelle.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.601
That's what Tom and I were
brought here for,

38:32.685 --> 38:34.687
