00:29.029 --> 00:30.864
-Oh, God.
-Say it again!

00:30.948 --> 00:32.991
Say it again, you child-ass little bitch!

00:33.075 --> 00:34.451
I said say it again!

00:34.535 --> 00:35.953
Prince Lyfe!

00:36.036 --> 00:37.746
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.879
-I know. Shit's cold, right?
-Phones in the bag.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.173
Not in the pocket, in the bag. Thank you.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.592
Okay, first of all, happy Halloween.

00:50.676 --> 00:54.012
You guys, all of you who dressed up,
you look amazing.

00:54.096 --> 00:57.099
Michelle, that's a great bloody princess.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.976
And, Olivia, are you Chun-Li?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.227
-Yeah.
-Nice.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.187
And, Ramon, that's an excellent chicken.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.397
What are you, Mr. Corman?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.524
I am Arrow from The Point!

01:05.607 --> 01:07.901
It's a Harry Nilsson album.
You can look it up.

01:07.985 --> 01:11.613
But, speaking of expressing ourselves,
today is also art class.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.782
Now, you know
I wish we could do art every day.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.578
But we have the very talented
Ms. Perry-Geller here for her weekly visit

01:17.661 --> 01:20.122
and she's got a project planned
I think you're gonna like.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.624
So, without any further ado,
Ms. Perry-Geller.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.918
Okay.

01:25.002 --> 01:28.422
Thank you, Mr. Corman,
for that lovely introduction.

01:29.298 --> 01:35.095
So today, since it's Halloween,
I thought we could make masks.

01:35.804 --> 01:40.392
You guys know that the word "mask"
in Ancient Rome was "persona"?

01:40.475 --> 01:41.894
Just like the word "person."

01:42.394 --> 01:45.063
So every person has a persona.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.525
You probably have a persona,
whether you realize it or not.

01:49.026 --> 01:54.573
And what that means is,
we're all wearing masks.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.576
Everyone say thank you
to Ms. Perry-Geller.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.537
-Thank you, Ms. Perry-Geller.
-You're welcome, Ramon.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.625
-That was great.
-Thank you.

02:04.708 --> 02:09.128
Yeah. And your costume,
by the way, is really good.

02:09.213 --> 02:12.674
Is it a sea creature
that ate too much plastic?

02:13.258 --> 02:14.426
Exactly.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.511
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.846
I thought I was, like, making a joke.
That's what it is?

02:17.930 --> 02:20.015
-That is it.
-That's tragic.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.226
Well, it is Día de los Muertos, so…

02:22.309 --> 02:23.435
So you're dead too?

02:23.519 --> 02:25.479
What do you think happens
to a sea creature

02:25.562 --> 02:27.397
-when she eats a bunch of plastic?
-Right.

02:28.857 --> 02:32.236
I heard this crazy percentage
of life in the ocean is going extinct.

02:33.070 --> 02:37.157
It is. But at least it makes
for a really good costume, right?

02:37.241 --> 02:38.242
Right.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.869
From dark times, comes great art,
as they say.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.913
Do they say that?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.290
I thought so. Maybe I made it up.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.751
-Probably not.
-No, probably not.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.797
But it is pretty dark times right now.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.091
Yeah, it feels like that.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.970
So, what are you again?
You said it's from an album?

02:58.053 --> 02:59.054
Yeah, The Point!

02:59.137 --> 03:00.305
What's The Point?

03:01.139 --> 03:02.182
Okay.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.811
No, that's part of it.
No, but it's this storybook record.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.897
It's about a place called
the Land of Point,

03:08.981 --> 03:11.191
where everybody has
a point on top of their head

03:11.275 --> 03:14.820
except for this one boy who doesn't
have a point, 'cause his head is round.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.781
And it's not easy
being the only pointless person

03:17.865 --> 03:19.533
in the whole Land of Point.

03:19.616 --> 03:23.954
But he does have one friend,
his blue dog, Arrow. And that's me.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.915
-You're the dog?
-Yeah.

03:27.833 --> 03:28.959
So where's your boy?

03:31.420 --> 03:32.629
I don't know.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.883
Well, it's a good costume. I like it.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.385
Thank you. It's not as good as yours.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.720
-Yours is great.
-Thank you.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.556
Yeah, I just wish I had somewhere good
to show it off.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.183
You're not gonna go out?

03:45.267 --> 03:47.811
Maybe. I don't know. Are you?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.521
-Yeah! It's Halloween.
-Okay.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.441
It's my favorite holiday.
It's the only holiday I care about at all.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.067
Wow. Bold statement.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.319
Yeah. It's true though.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.532
Well, if you wanna stay in touch,
I could, like,

04:01.450 --> 04:03.327
let you know where I'm headed or…

04:05.370 --> 04:06.371
Okay.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.374
-Okay.
-Okay.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.273
Flying high up in the sky

04:33.357 --> 04:38.612
I wonder why I have to have another
Point of view

04:46.912 --> 04:47.955
Yo.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.873
Hey, man.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.250
What's wrong?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.334
Nothing.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.044
They all out of good candy?

04:54.711 --> 04:55.712
No, what do you mean?

04:55.796 --> 04:58.090
-You bought candy corn on purpose?
-Yes, I did.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.883
-You like candy corn?
-Yeah, I love it.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.593
I'm sorry, is that okay with you?

05:01.677 --> 05:04.888
No, it's just weird
'cause candy corn is obviously terrible.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.683
-How did I not know this about you?
-Fuck if I know, bro.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.184
Everything okay?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.062
Yeah, I'm sorry, man. It's just

05:12.729 --> 05:15.566
Vanessa has Gabi for the holiday,
so I'm a little…

05:15.649 --> 05:17.025
That sucks.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.403
Dude, that's not right.
She's your daughter. It's Halloween.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.573
Yeah, it's nobody's fault though.
It's just how the schedule turned out.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.950
She has her for Halloween
'cause I had her for Easter, so…

05:25.033 --> 05:26.660
Yeah, but who cares about Easter?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.203
I care about Easter.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.123
-Then you can't really complain, can you?
-Cool.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.834
What do you wanna do tonight?

05:35.169 --> 05:37.254
Wanna play Call of Duty or something?

05:37.838 --> 05:40.591
-Well, I'm gonna go out tonight.
-Seriously?

05:41.133 --> 05:43.510
-It's Halloween. I always go out.
-That's bullshit.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.596
You never go out for Halloween.
You haven't in years.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.472
No, I go out on Halloween every year.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.850
I haven't gone out with you.
You've been doing your family thing.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.394
I know what I've been doing,
thanks very much.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.479
-What a dick thing to say. I just said…
-Hey.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.857
-…that I was hurting for my daughter.
-I'm sorry.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.358
-I'm sorry.
-All right.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.235
Where you gonna go?

06:01.904 --> 06:04.156
I'm actually gonna meet up
with that art teacher.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.949
-No shit. For real? Wow.
-Yeah, right?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.826
She came in today and I got her number.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.287
Wow. Good for you, man.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.998
Shit, where you gonna take her?

06:13.081 --> 06:14.708
Still figuring that out. You want one?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.877
No. I'm so full of candy corn.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.921
What do you mean you're figuring it out?

06:19.463 --> 06:20.756
Just waiting to hear back.

06:21.757 --> 06:22.758
From her?

06:23.967 --> 06:24.968
No.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.054
From who then?

06:28.263 --> 06:29.515
From Dax.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.142
-For fuck's sake. No.
-Dude.

06:32.226 --> 06:35.020
No, I get it. So I can't hang out with you
because I don't have enough followers?

06:35.103 --> 06:37.272
What are you talking about?
Who do you think you're talking to?

06:37.356 --> 06:39.149
You never bring me out
when you hang out with him.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.985
-I don't hang out with him, almost ever.
-You hung out with him last week.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.904
-That was months ago.
-Bullshit. That was weeks ago.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.281
But that was the first time
since I don't even know how long.

06:46.365 --> 06:47.866
-Before I broke up with Megan.
-Right.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.701
She grew up with him.
I don't even like that guy.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.329
-Then why are you hanging out with him?
-He goes out all the time.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.373
He knows about that whole world.
I don't know that shit.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.834
I'm tryna meet up with this girl.
I have to have somewhere to bring her.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.795
Cool, yeah. Of course, man.
Have a great fucking time. All right?

07:00.546 --> 07:01.755
Do you wanna come?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.343
I mean, do you want me to come?

07:06.844 --> 07:08.720
-I mean--
-Wow. Take longer to think about it.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.056
-Fuck you. I don't wanna come.
-No, it's just a costume thing,

07:11.139 --> 07:14.059
and my only hesitation is
I didn't know if you have a costume.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.187
I have a fucking costume, bro.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.076
You think Dax had to wait in this?

08:26.673 --> 08:27.758
Thanks, man.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.010
Let's do this.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.683
I need a soda though.
I kinda have a weird taste in my mouth.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.895
I'm gonna let the art teacher know
that we're here.

08:39.977 --> 08:40.979
All right.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.694
-You good?
-Yeah.

08:47.778 --> 08:48.779
All right.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.407
Sorry.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.993
Yo, dude. What the fuck, man?

08:55.661 --> 08:57.204
-Oh, my God.
-You good?

08:57.287 --> 08:58.288
All right.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.207
Excuse us.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.000
Shit.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.672
Sorry. Sorry.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.800
What's she saying?

09:09.883 --> 09:10.884
Yeehaw!

09:10.968 --> 09:12.845
You gotta ride that bull
eight seconds to win.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.555
All right. What's up, man?

09:14.638 --> 09:17.432
Shit, man. Just fucking doing my job.
Showing the people a good time.

09:17.516 --> 09:18.517
What are you, Sonic?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.602
-No, it's Arrow.
-Yo, what's up, man? I'm Victor.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.939
For sure, man. I'm Dax.
Yo, where's your lady friend?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.065
She's coming.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.984
Cool. That's cool, man.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.361
Sorry, can I just borrow you for a second?

09:29.444 --> 09:30.863
-Yeah. I'll be here.
-Dope.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.242
Bro, I thought you said plus one female.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.368
Yeah, she's coming.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.203
Yeah, right.
But you brought dick and balls.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.831
I know. I talked to him
after I already texted with you, and--

09:40.914 --> 09:44.042
You just gotta understand
there's a guy-girl ratio.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.420
The dude paying me,
he watches this kinda shit.

09:46.503 --> 09:50.007
-You're fucking me here, man.
-Yeah, but we waited in line, so…

09:51.258 --> 09:53.844
You know what? Fuck it.
That guy never really pays me anyway,

09:53.927 --> 09:55.012
so he can just eat a dick.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.513
-What's your friend's name again?
-Victor.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.473
-Victor. Yo, big dog.
-Yeah? Sorry.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.517
Listen, man,
I'm so happy you guys are here.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.352
-Sure.
-If y'all need anything, just let me know.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.646
All right, cool.
Yo, I follow you on Instagram, dude.

10:04.730 --> 10:05.939
What? Seriously?

10:06.023 --> 10:07.065
-Yeah.
-Yo, thank you, sir.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.902
Man, that means so much, dude.
How do you like the content?

10:09.985 --> 10:11.195
Yeah, it's good.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.821
Fuck yeah, man.
That's what I'm talking about.

10:12.905 --> 10:13.989
'Cause I'm not gonna lie.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.909
It's a big investment taking the time
and keeping engagement up.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.578
But at this point, it's really
the only thing in town that matters.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.413
-So, what's your handle?
-Me?

10:21.496 --> 10:22.956
-Yeah, man.
-Why?

10:23.040 --> 10:25.417
'Cause I can tell you're a good person,
and I like your utility belt.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.336
So I'm gonna tag you
and get you some followers.

10:27.419 --> 10:28.754
-Are you for real?
-Yeah.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.673
What do I look like, a fucking asshole?
Like I'd be lying to you right now?

10:31.757 --> 10:33.050
-Give it to me.
-All right.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.219
So it's "AnotherVictorMorales."

10:35.302 --> 10:36.595
-Together. Yeah.
-Okay, all right. Yo.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.264
It's been done a lot,
but it works if that's your name, so…

10:39.348 --> 10:41.225
-That is my name, so…
-Word. Let's check you out, dog.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.728
-Nah, you don't have to check me out.
-Shit, Victor. Yo, 443.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.647
Dude, you're creeping up on half a K.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.191
Yo, tonight we might fuck around
and get you to 500, bro.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.484
-For real?
-Fuck yeah.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.986
Look, I didn't say it was gonna be easy,
but you can definitely do it.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.696
Hey, yo, Josh,
get your pointy-eared Papa Smurf,

10:54.780 --> 10:56.740
-Blue Man Group-looking ass in--
-No, I'm good.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.367
-You guys want a drink?
-A drink?

10:58.450 --> 11:00.536
Oh, my God,
you're just so fucking thoughtful.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.246
Megan should have never
broken up with your ass.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.914
That's some cold-ass shit, dude.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.624
-I didn't say shit.
-I'm playing, dude.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.543
Come on, dog, it's me.
I'm just fucking with you.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.794
Can I get a vodka soda?

11:08.877 --> 11:10.254
-Please and thank you.
-I'll get a Coke.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.089
-Coke?
-Yeah, great.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.173
Thank you.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.837
All right, you're a kitty-cat. So
let me guess, you're independent, right?

11:51.920 --> 11:55.090
You're the type I could just
leave you alone with a bowl of milk

11:55.174 --> 11:56.383
and you'd be cool?

11:57.217 --> 11:58.218
Yeah.

12:00.179 --> 12:03.056
Hey, bunny. What kind of bunny are you?

12:03.140 --> 12:04.141
I don't know.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.019
Asshole.

12:07.102 --> 12:11.106
Halloween, it's the holiday where
women think they're hotter than they are.

12:11.899 --> 12:12.900
-Hi. Can I--
-Hey,

12:12.983 --> 12:14.985
can I get three more
Jamesons on the rocks?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.617
I was actually here before you.

12:37.799 --> 12:38.884
-Yo.
-Yo.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.260
Sorry. That took forever.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.054
All good. Your girl coming?

12:42.137 --> 12:43.514
-Yeah, I just heard from her.
-Dope.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.474
You know where Dax is? I got his drink.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.143
-No idea, bro.
-That's great.

12:48.227 --> 12:49.561
Should we go look for him?

12:49.645 --> 12:51.104
-I guess so.
-All right. Right.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.273
Sorry.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.108
Excuse.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.781
Okay. Okay. Intense. Intensity.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.377
Dude, you're Sonic just like me, man.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.670
Same costume.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.339
-No, I'm Arrow.
-No, it's like looking in a mirror.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.807
I'm going to make our country rich again.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.517
Trump! Trump! Trump!

13:37.568 --> 13:41.780
Dream of Californication

13:42.406 --> 13:46.159
Dream of Californication

13:46.243 --> 13:47.411
Oh, my God.

13:47.494 --> 13:52.416
Dream of Californication

13:52.916 --> 13:54.459
-Fuck.
-I fucking love that song!

13:54.543 --> 13:55.961
-It is so good.
-Yo.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.379
You know what's crazy?

13:57.462 --> 13:58.630
-What?
-Ever since I turned 30,

13:58.714 --> 14:00.549
it's so different
singing along to songs like that.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.426
Like, when I was younger,
I'd be singing along, like,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.303
"Yo, this is gonna fucking be me, man."

14:04.386 --> 14:06.805
Anthony Kiedis is my teacher
and I'm his student

14:06.889 --> 14:09.266
on some Obi-Wan Kenobi,
Luke Skywalker type shit.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.686
And I'm, like, embodying
this motherfucker's soul as a performer.

14:12.769 --> 14:16.648
Like, part of my training to take
my rightful place beside the Chili Peppers

14:16.732 --> 14:20.152
and fucking Hov and Bowie, and just
the gods of show business.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.237
But now I'm old and it didn't--
It could still--

14:22.321 --> 14:24.281
Anything can fucking happen,
that's not the point.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.618
The point is, okay, I just know
I'm not gonna be one of those icons,

14:27.701 --> 14:30.287
'cause if I was gonna be one of those
then it would've happened already.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.373
So now when I sing along, it's not, like,
part of my training.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.626
It's not really going anywhere like that.
I'm just a fan.

14:35.709 --> 14:40.589
But, dude, you ask any fucking musician,
since the beginning of time and space,

14:40.672 --> 14:43.800
and they will tell you how much
they fucking love their fans, man.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.553
Like from the heart, you know what I mean?
Do you feel me on that--

14:46.637 --> 14:48.722
Like you-- In there. Know what I mean?

14:48.805 --> 14:50.015
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.808
Like, not really. No.

14:51.892 --> 14:55.729
No, I think you have to talk to Josh about
that type of shit, dude. My bad, yeah.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.857
Fucking no thanks, bro.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.446
-Oh, shit.
-What?

15:04.530 --> 15:05.739
I'm up to 467, bro.

15:05.822 --> 15:06.990
-What? Yo, motherfucker.
-Yeah.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.534
-Bro, what did I say, bro?
-All right.

15:08.617 --> 15:11.203
-What did I say? Let me see this.
-All right.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.247
Okay, but come here.
Look at this last post.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.082
-Right.
-Okay. You got four comments

15:15.165 --> 15:18.126
and you haven't written back yet.
You gotta engage with the people

15:18.210 --> 15:20.128
and make them feel like they're equal.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.130
-You know what I mean? Yeah.
-Okay. All right, yeah.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.091
Like, but what do I say, like,
right there?

15:24.174 --> 15:26.677
You gotta find your own brand.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.721
-Thanks a lot, dude.
-No, I didn't mean it like that.

15:29.805 --> 15:33.308
-Like, okay, what do you do?
-I'm an on-road supervisor for UPS.

15:33.392 --> 15:35.018
-Dope. Okay. No, that's good, man.
-Yeah.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.728
That's really good 'cause

15:36.812 --> 15:37.980
it feels authentic.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.815
And that's what people want,
is authenticity.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.025
-Fuck yeah.
-If you ask a--

15:42.734 --> 15:45.737
Oh, shit, I see that smile.
Yo, is that your lady?

15:46.321 --> 15:48.198
-Yeah.
-She coming or what?

15:48.282 --> 15:49.908
-I think so.
-You think so?

15:49.992 --> 15:52.494
Man, gimme that phone. I'll get
the bitch here in two texts or less.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.997
-I'm all set, thanks.
-All right, killer, do your thing.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.583
Look, I gotta handle some shit,
so I'll holler at you guys later?

15:57.666 --> 15:58.750
All right, bro. Yep.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.380
Cool guy. He's cool.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.723
"Come on over."

16:13.974 --> 16:14.975
What?

16:15.058 --> 16:17.394
You're fucking corny, bro.

16:27.529 --> 16:30.115
Hey, you wanna get outta here?
Try to get some food?

16:32.492 --> 16:33.911
Just text her again.

16:33.994 --> 16:34.995
I did.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.079
You did? When?

16:37.206 --> 16:38.707
-What'd you say?
-I'm not telling.

16:38.790 --> 16:39.833
All right.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.194
Let's just go.

17:10.489 --> 17:11.490
Yep.

17:13.534 --> 17:15.452
It seemed real, but I don't know.

17:15.536 --> 17:17.371
-Fuck that bitch, man.
-No. Can we not do that?

17:17.454 --> 17:18.622
If she's gonna be a dick about--

17:18.704 --> 17:20.249
You don't need to start
saying mean things about her.

17:20.332 --> 17:23.126
It's not helping,
so let's stop talking about it.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.546
Oh, shit. Look who it is.
You wanna say hi?

17:26.922 --> 17:28.423
Yep. I guess so.

17:28.507 --> 17:29.508
Yo, yo!

17:30.217 --> 17:31.718
-Damn, you guys still here?
-Yep.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.429
Yo, I'm only at 471, man.
I didn't quite make it.

17:34.513 --> 17:36.932
Nah, you just gotta keep engaging, bro.
You'll get there.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.142
-Yeah.
-You guys getting a ride home or…

17:39.226 --> 17:40.727
I didn't drink, so…

17:40.811 --> 17:43.146
Word. How'd the
rest of your night turn out, man?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.941
Your girl never showed up, did she?
Fuck that bitch, man.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.276
Thank you.

17:47.359 --> 17:49.278
-You don't have to--
-Pedro! My friend!

17:49.361 --> 17:51.989
Yo, thanks for looking out for me.
I appreciate it.

17:52.072 --> 17:56.118
The DJ? Amazing.
Like, absolutely incredible.

17:56.994 --> 17:59.663
If you get a chance,
you should check it out, yeah?

17:59.746 --> 18:00.789
Here.

18:01.290 --> 18:02.916
Keep it. Have a good time.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.084
Y'all ready?

18:05.169 --> 18:07.546
You know, that dude
has 1.6 million followers.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.256
-How do you know?
-It's my job to know.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.425
-What's he do?
-The same fucking thing I do.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.677
-Does it a lot better than me, I guess.
-What do you do again?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.095
This dude is everywhere, man.

18:15.179 --> 18:17.181
Like, everybody's jocking him,
and he says he makes music.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.308
-Yeah, okay.
-Exactly, bro. It's garbage.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.685
Even he knows it's garbage.
He talks about it being garbage.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.187
But I guess that's what people like.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.730
I don't know. He works out a lot.

18:24.813 --> 18:27.316
Bro, I work out a lot too,
but I do not look like this guy, man.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.193
I guess he's got better genes.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.403
Either that
or he's probably fucking juicing.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.488
But then again,
quality juice gets expensive,

18:33.572 --> 18:34.865
and that's, like, the weird thing.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.992
You know, this dude's driving a Model X.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.494
Even with 1.6, there's no way
you're pulling that kind of cash.

18:39.578 --> 18:41.747
So honestly, he probably
just grew up rich, you know?

18:41.830 --> 18:44.583
He never talks about mommy
and daddy, and he says he's self-made,

18:44.666 --> 18:46.960
which is what fucking everybody
in the industry says.

18:47.044 --> 18:48.962
And I'd say he bought his followers,

18:49.046 --> 18:51.256
but he obviously didn't
'cause he's got the likes to back it up.

18:51.340 --> 18:52.841
I don't know,
he's got a good fucking face.

18:52.925 --> 18:55.594
-Like, it's annoying, dude.
-Yeah. But fuck that guy, man.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.846
You think he's really happy? Actually?

18:57.930 --> 19:00.057
Yo, I would be happy if I was him.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.267
If I had that many people
giving me love every day.

19:02.351 --> 19:03.560
Now, see, there's your mistake.

19:03.644 --> 19:06.480
You can't care what other people think
'cause the vast majority of people:

19:06.563 --> 19:08.273
-fucking idiots.
-And we're going dark. Okay.

19:08.357 --> 19:11.109
-Not everyone is an idiot, bro.
-Not everyone, but pretty much everyone.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.278
No one has any reasoning
behind what they think.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.364
They don't like things
because they actually like it.

19:15.447 --> 19:18.116
They just think they're supposed to.
It's what their friends and parents like.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.952
You're just pissed
'cause some chick flaked on you.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.912
You don't know what you're talking about.
Bro, look--

19:21.995 --> 19:24.164
Whatever. I know it's cool
to be like, "Fuck the world,

19:24.248 --> 19:25.958
I just don't give a fuck."
But you know what?

19:26.041 --> 19:28.168
I do give a fuck,
and I'm not scared to say it, bro.

19:28.252 --> 19:29.920
I want people to like me, man.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.381
-It's just nobody does.
-Come on. That's not true.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.216
Look, don't get me wrong. I'm surviving.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.593
I'm doing my thing
or whatever the fuck, man.

19:36.677 --> 19:38.929
But unless you're really killing it,
like, really snapping,

19:39.012 --> 19:41.139
nobody cares about you.
I don't even have any real friends.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.850
And, I mean, no offense, bro.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.143
But I've known you longer
than anybody else I saw here tonight,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.437
and I wouldn't consider us friends.
You don't care about me, man.

19:47.521 --> 19:48.939
-That's not true.
-Yo, fuck you, man!

19:49.022 --> 19:49.857
Hey.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.567
I know you're supposed to be
this really nice guy,

19:51.650 --> 19:52.776
and everybody knows how nice you are.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.654
But at least be a fucking man and admit
when somebody's telling you the truth.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.990
You do not care about me, man!

19:58.073 --> 19:59.908
You just call me when you wanna get laid.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.326
All right, dude. Okay.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.704
-Fucking asshole.
-All right. Hey, it's okay. Come on.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.122
Fuck him. All right.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.499
It's annoying.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.688
-Say it again, motherfucker!
-Yo. Chill, dude.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.356
-Say it again, huh?
-Chill. Chill.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.151
You too pussy to say it again,
you fucking glittery-ass motherfucker?

20:34.234 --> 20:36.612
You think I got time to be fucking
with little bitches like you, man?

20:36.695 --> 20:38.488
-You some big man now?
-We're good. Dude--

20:38.572 --> 20:40.824
-I'm bigger than you, little bitch-ass.
-This is stupid, you guys.

20:40.908 --> 20:41.992
-Walk away, come on.
-Nah. Wait.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.620
Now this little blue twink with the ears--
I'm not tryna deal with you.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.371
-Chill out.
-Why don't you do something

20:46.455 --> 20:48.832
-instead of talking like a little girl--
-Yeah? You wanna go--

20:48.916 --> 20:50.167
-Fuck.
-Stop!

20:50.250 --> 20:51.460
Chill the fuck out, bro!

20:51.543 --> 20:52.794
-Jesus!
-Fuck, man!

21:54.857 --> 21:55.899
Fucker.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.632
Yo, me and my boys just fist-fucked
your whole face, son.

23:01.715 --> 23:02.925
Like, "bow"!

23:07.054 --> 23:08.889
Yo! Yo, come on!

23:10.057 --> 23:11.517
Josh, what the fuck? Come on!

23:12.226 --> 23:13.227
Shit.

23:13.769 --> 23:15.229
Yo, what the fuck?

23:16.313 --> 23:17.856
Yo, what the fuck?

23:18.690 --> 23:20.526
Oh, my God!

23:20.609 --> 23:22.027
What the fuck was that?

23:24.363 --> 23:26.657
Yo. Did you see that one dude, like--

23:26.740 --> 23:29.159
Couldn't even get a hit in.
I was fucking him up!

23:29.243 --> 23:30.452
-Yeah, you fucked him up!
-A hundred percent.

23:30.536 --> 23:32.621
But did you see Vic
pick that other guy up?

23:32.704 --> 23:35.374
-That was, like, crazy.
-You picked him up into the air!

23:35.457 --> 23:36.834
I made that guy my bitch, dude.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.794
But then you just put him back down.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.128
-I know.
-So good.

23:40.212 --> 23:41.713
Safety first, bro, you know?

23:42.881 --> 23:44.216
-What about this guy though?
-Yeah.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.801
He got a few in.
I was like, "fucking damn."

23:45.884 --> 23:46.885
Kinda weird to see.

23:46.969 --> 23:49.054
I have never done that shit before
in my life.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.889
Yeah. But that's how it goes.

23:50.973 --> 23:52.474
-Crazy.
-But that's how it goes, bro.

23:52.558 --> 23:55.227
It's instinct, right? You see your homeys,
you back 'em up immediately, right?

23:55.310 --> 23:57.604
Bro!
Like when that fucking super Hulk dude,

23:57.688 --> 23:59.439
he's like, "I'm going to kill you."

23:59.523 --> 24:02.359
You fucking came outta nowhere
and you clotheslined the shit out of him.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.279
-I saw that shit!
-Bro, where did that come from, dog?

24:05.362 --> 24:07.781
-Honestly, I don't know.
-Bro, where?

24:07.865 --> 24:09.408
-Somewhere deep.
-Let me know.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.909
I need some of that too.

24:10.993 --> 24:12.411
The guy was in shock, dude.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.454
He was like,
"This fucking blue motherfucker--

24:14.538 --> 24:16.415
This Blue Man Group guy
just fucked me up."

24:16.498 --> 24:18.834
-It's not Blue Man Group. It's Arrow.
-I know! I know that.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.377
He doesn't know that.

24:20.460 --> 24:23.046
He was just like,
"Where the fuck did you come from?"

24:53.493 --> 24:54.661
Yo.

24:56.955 --> 24:57.956
-Josh!
-Yeah.

25:00.417 --> 25:01.418
-Did you see?
-Yeah.

25:01.502 --> 25:03.086
I'm just hearing about it right now.

25:05.714 --> 25:08.425
We were just with him. Like--

25:08.509 --> 25:11.386
-We dropped him off, like, five hours ago.
-I don't know. Yeah.

25:11.470 --> 25:13.222
-He was fine.
-He was fine.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.307
He was cracking jokes and shit.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.267
-He was fine, right?
-Yeah.

25:21.438 --> 25:22.648
-Oh, shit.
-What?

25:23.815 --> 25:25.317
I broke 500.
