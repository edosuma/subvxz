IS THAT SHE'S HAPPY.

18:50.917 --> 18:53.083
JEEZ LOUISE,
YOU ARE BORING.

18:53.083 --> 18:56.041
I THINK IT SHOULD END
TRAGICALLY.

18:56.041 --> 18:58.500
10 YEARS FROM NOW,
SHE PASSES YOU IN THE STREET.

18:58.500 --> 19:02.625
YOU'RE PENNILESS
AND PATHETIC.

19:02.625 --> 19:03.667
AND YOU RUN AFTER HER,

19:03.667 --> 19:06.291
BUT SHE JUST THINKS
YOU'RE SOME CRAZY BUM.

19:06.291 --> 19:10.708
AND THEN, JUST AS YOU'RE
CROSSING THE STREET...

19:10.708 --> 19:11.333
PSSSHH!

19:11.333 --> 19:14.458
YOU GET HIT BY A BUS.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.291
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH ENDINGS.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.959
COME ON.
TELL ME MORE.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.542
I LIVE FOR THIS JUNK.

19:22.542 --> 19:23.917
ALL RIGHT.

19:23.917 --> 19:24.959
[CROWD CHEERING]

19:24.959 --> 19:26.667
SO, LISTEN, NEXT TIME
YOU'RE IN NEW YORK...

19:26.667 --> 19:29.083
GIVE ME A CALL,
AND I'LL HOOK YOU UP.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.917
YEAH, WITH WHAT?

19:30.917 --> 19:32.417
CONCERT TICKETS,
BACKSTAGE PASSES,

19:32.417 --> 19:35.792
AND MAYBE EVEN A
BEHIND-THE-SCENES TOUR.

19:35.792 --> 19:37.750
COOL.
YEAH.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.000
EXCUSE ME.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.583
IS, UH, THIS GUY
BOTHERING YOU?

19:40.583 --> 19:42.500
NO.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.667
WELL, HE LOOKS
LIKE HE IS.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.291
JUST, YOU KNOW,
GO AWAY, DUDE.

19:45.291 --> 19:48.041
ACTUALLY, HE USED
TO BE A MEMBER OF--

19:48.041 --> 19:49.875
DIT DIT DIT DIT DIT.
HEH HEH HEH.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.000
DON'T SAY IT.
DON'T EVEN THINK IT.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.834
I'M GONNA GO MINGLE.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.625
IT WAS REALLY NICE
MEETING YOU, JOEY.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.166
NICE MEETING YOU.

19:58.834 --> 20:01.083
"GO AWAY, DUDE"?

20:01.083 --> 20:02.166
HEY, IT WORKED,
DIDN'T IT?

20:06.834 --> 20:07.875
[BREATHLESS]
JEN, JEN.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.834
I FOUND YOU.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.041
I ENTERED US
IN A HOTEL RAFFLE.

20:11.041 --> 20:14.041
WE COULD WIN,
LIKE, 2 WEEKS IN
A MIAMI TIMESHARE.

20:14.041 --> 20:16.875
YEAH! AWESOME.
GIVE ME A WHOO-WHOO!

20:16.875 --> 20:17.875
COME ON.
WHOO! WHOO!

20:17.875 --> 20:19.875
COME ON. WHOO! WHOO!

20:19.875 --> 20:21.333
[COUGHING]

20:21.333 --> 20:23.083
WHOO. WHOO.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:23.083 --> 20:26.375
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LIE,
EXACTLY.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.708
OF COURSE NOT.
YOU JUST COULDN'T
HELP YOURSELF.

20:27.708 --> 20:30.291
I JUST--I DIDN'T
WANT TO HAVE THIS
DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW.

20:30.291 --> 20:33.000
IT WOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN A DISCUSSION

20:33.000 --> 20:34.500
IF YOU WOULD'VE
JUST TOLD ME, AUDREY.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.750
COME ON. YOU NEVER
WOULD'VE LET IT GO
THAT EASY.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.208
YOU WOULD'VE ASKED ME
A MILLION QUESTIONS,

20:38.208 --> 20:39.291
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

20:39.291 --> 20:40.542
LIKE I ALWAYS  DO?

20:40.542 --> 20:41.917
I ALWAYS DO THINGS?

20:41.917 --> 20:43.208
YOU WOULD'VE
WANTED TO KNOW
HOW LONG WE DATED,

20:43.208 --> 20:45.834
HOW MANY TIMES
WE HAD SEX,

20:45.834 --> 20:46.750
IF HE WAS BETTER
THAN YOU.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.667
IT WOULD'VE RUINED
OUR WHOLE EVENING.

20:48.667 --> 20:49.625
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT.

20:49.625 --> 20:50.583
YOUR WAY OF DOING THINGS
IS MUCH BETTER

20:50.583 --> 20:53.542
BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING
A GREAT TIME NOW.

20:53.542 --> 20:56.458
I AM SORRY. OK?

20:56.458 --> 20:57.792
I MESSED UP.

20:57.792 --> 21:00.792
[SIGHS]

21:00.792 --> 21:03.708
THERE'S MORE
TO THIS WHOLE THING,
ISN'T THERE?

21:03.708 --> 21:05.625
GOD! WHAT MORE
DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

21:05.625 --> 21:07.291
YES, CHRIS AND I DATED.
YES, I LOVED HIM.

21:07.291 --> 21:10.000
HE WAS LIKE...
MY DAWSON. OK?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.291
BREAKING UP WITH HIM
WAS, LIKE,

21:11.291 --> 21:12.792
THE HARDEST THING
I'VE EVER HAD TO DO,

21:12.792 --> 21:13.959
AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

21:13.959 --> 21:14.834
I WONDER IF I MADE
THE WRONG DECISION.

21:14.834 --> 21:16.333
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HEAR?

21:16.333 --> 21:18.375
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.583
UGH. SO...

21:20.583 --> 21:22.583
I DON'T--WHAT?

21:22.583 --> 21:23.333
ARE YOU MAD AT ME NOW?

21:23.333 --> 21:25.208
NO, I'M NOT MAD
AT ALL.

21:25.208 --> 21:25.458
WHY WOULD I BE MAD?

21:27.333 --> 21:28.542
OK. WELL,
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.

21:29.708 --> 21:31.750
WHY?

21:31.750 --> 21:33.500
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.458
REMEMBER, AUDREY?

21:34.458 --> 21:35.917
WITH NO STRINGS
ATTACHED.

21:35.917 --> 21:39.208
LYING IS FOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE IN SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIPS,

21:39.208 --> 21:41.250
AND YOU AND I WERE
NEVER THAT SERIOUS.

21:45.625 --> 21:48.625
NO. YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.250
THANKS A LOT, PACEY.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.375
TRUST ME,
I DID THE RIGHT THING.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.458
HOW DID YOU MANAGE
TO RATIONALIZE THAT ONE?

22:04.458 --> 22:05.500
JUST HEAR ME OUT
FOR A SECOND.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.625
BACK IN THE DAY,

22:06.625 --> 22:08.000
HOW WOULD
THE OLD-SCHOOL PACEY

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
DEAL WITH
A COMPLICATED
LOVE TRIANGLE?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.041
HE WOULD DIVE RIGHT IN,
GET ALL BLOODIED UP,

22:11.041 --> 22:13.917
AND STILL LOSE THE GIRL
IN THE END ANYWAY.

22:13.917 --> 22:14.667
PACEY, THAT'S
NOT EVEN THE SAME--

22:14.667 --> 22:17.375
EH, EH, IT'S OK,
BECAUSE...

22:17.375 --> 22:18.583
I LEARNED FROM IT.

22:18.583 --> 22:19.792
I LEARNED HOW
TO RECOGNIZE IT,

22:19.792 --> 22:20.834
AND I LEARNED HOW
TO AVOID IT,

22:20.834 --> 22:23.333
THEREBY, NOT MAKING
THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE.

22:23.333 --> 22:24.917
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY CALL THAT, FRIEND?

22:24.917 --> 22:26.083
THEY CALL THAT GROWTH.

22:26.083 --> 22:29.166
PACE, HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT'S EVEN THE SAME THING?

22:29.166 --> 22:30.917
BECAUSE SHE SAID,
"HE'S MY DAWSON."

22:30.917 --> 22:32.000
WHICH IS, OF COURSE,
MY PERSONAL KRYPTONITE.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.166
OK, SO I HAD A DAWSON.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.834
DO YOU SEE ME
WITH HIM TODAY?

22:36.834 --> 22:37.500
NO.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.834
HE'S PART OF HER PAST.

22:39.834 --> 22:41.333
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT I'VE LEARNED
FROM HISTORY,

22:41.333 --> 22:43.875
IT'S THAT DAWSON IS NOT
THE PAST TENSE OF A NOUN
FOR YOU LADIES.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.917
IF ANYTHING,
HE IS THE PAST,
PRESENT, AND FUTURE.

22:45.917 --> 22:47.792
SO, WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
IS A WOMAN

22:47.792 --> 22:49.000
WHO HAS NO SOULMATE
TO SPEAK OF.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.542
NO SOULMATE
AND SMALLISH FEET,
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

22:51.542 --> 22:52.333
YOU WANT AUDREY.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.750
THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

22:54.750 --> 22:55.834
AND SHE WANTS YOU.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.875
IF YOU WOULD JUST
OPEN YOURSELVES UP

22:57.875 --> 23:00.000
TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT
YOU COULD NEED EACH OTHER,

23:00.000 --> 23:00.875
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
FALL IN LOVE.

23:00.875 --> 23:04.166
RIGHT.

23:04.166 --> 23:06.500
SO, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

23:06.500 --> 23:08.500
DO YOU ACTUALLY
FOLLOW YOUR OWN ADVICE,

23:08.500 --> 23:11.291
OR DO I HAVE TO
DISPENSE IT FOR YOU?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.208
HIM? NO.

23:14.208 --> 23:17.375
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.333
I DON'T EVEN LIKE HIM.

23:19.333 --> 23:20.333
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.917
THE BLUSHING,
THE FLIRTING,

23:21.917 --> 23:23.708
THE LAUGHING,
THE SINGING--

23:23.708 --> 23:25.917
OK. MAYBE I LIKE HIM
A LITTLE,

23:25.917 --> 23:27.375
BUT JUST IN THAT
STUPID FUN WAY.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.708
IT'S NOT LIKE
I COULD SEE US

23:30.708 --> 23:31.750
EVER HAVING
A SERIOUS FUTURE.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.000
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT
A SERIOUS FUTURE?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.041
I'M TALKING ABOUT
RIGHT NOW.

23:35.041 --> 23:36.250
WHAT'S THE POINT?
IF I ALREADY--

23:36.250 --> 23:37.500
THE POINT IS...

23:37.500 --> 23:39.417
HE CAME ALL THE WAY HERE
TO SEE YOU.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.959
AND HE CALLED ME--
A RATHER INTIMIDATING
EX-BOYFRIEND--

23:41.959 --> 23:43.500
TO FIND OUT
WHERE YOU WERE.

23:44.041 --> 23:46.375
THAT TAKES GUTS.

23:46.375 --> 23:48.250
OR HE COULD JUST BE
AN IDIOT.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.250
HE COULD BE.

23:49.250 --> 23:50.500
WHY DON'T YOU
GO FIND OUT?

23:52.458 --> 23:54.041
OK.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.708
I NEVER SAID
IT WASN'T CONFUSING.

23:55.708 --> 23:56.458
OK. THEN TELL ME
ONE THING YOU KNOW.

23:56.458 --> 23:58.583
I KNOW
I WANTED YOU THERE.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.834
AT THE END OF THE DAY
WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY ROOM,

24:00.834 --> 24:01.166
I WANTED YOU THERE.

24:01.166 --> 24:02.959
WHY?

24:02.959 --> 24:03.917
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

24:03.917 --> 24:04.959
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I MEANT.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.083
I JUST KNOW THAT
I WANTED YOU THERE.

24:06.083 --> 24:07.875
MAYBE THAT'S THE ENDING
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.583
MAYBE EVERY OTHER
ATTRACTION WE FEEL

24:09.583 --> 24:11.083
TOWARDS EACH OTHER
IS JUST FEAR

24:11.083 --> 24:11.917
OF MOVING ON
AND GROWING UP.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.542
IS THAT WHAT
YOU REALLY THINK?

24:13.542 --> 24:14.834
[SIGHS] I DON'T KNOW.

24:14.834 --> 24:15.583
BUT I DO KNOW
IF I GET ON THIS PLANE,

24:15.583 --> 24:17.417
I'M NEVER
GONNA FIND OUT.

24:17.417 --> 24:18.750
ALL RIGHT? 'CAUSE
WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON,

24:18.750 --> 24:20.041
WE'RE GONNA GROW UP.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.708
AND 4 YEARS FROM NOW,
WE'RE GONNA WAKE UP,

24:21.708 --> 24:22.917
AND WE'RE GONNA BE
COMPLETE STRANGERS
TO EACH OTHER.

24:22.917 --> 24:24.542
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT I KNOW FOR SURE

24:24.542 --> 24:27.166
IS THAT I DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.333
DO YOU?

24:28.333 --> 24:29.834
NO.

24:29.834 --> 24:31.041
SO, DAWSON,
YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT IT, AREN'T YOU?

24:31.041 --> 24:33.000
WHAT?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.125
HIGHJACKING THE CAR,
GOING TO FLORIDA.

24:34.125 --> 24:36.500
NO.
PFFT.

24:36.500 --> 24:37.667
NO. NO.

24:37.667 --> 24:38.834
TH-TH-THAT'D BE
COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS.

24:38.834 --> 24:40.875
HMM?

24:40.875 --> 24:43.667
WHAT, ARE YOU STUPID?
NO. IT'S...

24:43.667 --> 24:44.542
[SIGHS] EVEN IF I WAS,

24:44.542 --> 24:47.542
WHAT'S LEFT TO SAY
AT THIS POINT?

24:47.542 --> 24:51.166
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH
YOUR HEAD, MAN,

24:51.166 --> 24:52.125
BUT THAT STORY...

24:52.125 --> 24:54.333
THE WAY YOU TOLD IT...

24:54.333 --> 24:55.333
WELL, IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE SUN

24:55.333 --> 24:57.750
RISES AND SETS
WITH THIS GIRL.

25:00.208 --> 25:01.125
IT DOES.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.333
SO, THEN WHY DON'T YOU

25:02.333 --> 25:05.166
HANG YOUR BALLS
OUT THERE
AND TELL HER THAT?

25:05.166 --> 25:06.208
I FEEL LIKE
I DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT.

25:06.208 --> 25:08.333
I PUSHED HER AWAY,
AND SHE MOVED ON.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.834
WELL, MAYBE SHE HAS.

25:11.834 --> 25:14.500
BUT UNTIL YOU HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION,

25:14.500 --> 25:15.667
HOW WILL YOU EVER KNOW?

25:21.708 --> 25:23.500
[SIGHS] UHH!

25:23.500 --> 25:24.667
WHAT ABOUT THE MEETING?

25:24.667 --> 25:25.834
WELL, WE'LL RESCHEDULE.

25:25.834 --> 25:27.625
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

25:27.625 --> 25:31.583
MEETINGS COME AND GO,
BUT THIS...

25:31.583 --> 25:34.250
THIS IS HOW YOU ACHIEVE
TRUE GREATNESS,
MY FRIEND.

25:42.917 --> 25:43.542
HUH?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.917
WHICH WAY TO FLORIDA?

25:45.917 --> 25:48.917
GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST,
LET'S GO!

25:55.125 --> 25:57.291
DON'T PEOPLE USUALLY SURF
IN THE WATER?

25:57.291 --> 25:59.250
ARE YOU GOING TO QUESTION
EVERY SINGLE THING
THAT I SAY?

25:59.250 --> 26:00.500
MOST LIKELY, YES.

26:09.250 --> 26:11.041
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY,
DON'T YOU?

26:11.041 --> 26:11.959
YEAH.
YEAH?

26:21.625 --> 26:24.875
Joey: AAH! NO.
Charlie: OH, NO, YOU DON'T! HEY!

26:33.834 --> 26:34.834
HMM?

26:38.667 --> 26:41.625
YOU SURE PARTIED HARD
LAST NIGHT.

26:41.625 --> 26:43.917
HMM. YEAH. I KNOW.

26:43.917 --> 26:46.750
I HAD A BLAST.
I THINK.

26:46.750 --> 26:51.917
WELL...YOU PASSED OUT,
AND I PUT YOU TO BED.

26:51.917 --> 26:54.208
[SIGHS] YEAH, WELL...

26:54.208 --> 26:56.333
THANK YOU
FOR THAT, JEN.

26:56.333 --> 26:59.417
WILL WE BE ARRIVING
AT A POINT ANYTIME SOON?

26:59.417 --> 27:01.041
I THINK MAYBE
YOU'RE DRINKING TO--

27:01.041 --> 27:02.250
NO, NO, NO, NO.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.250
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DO THAT, ALL RIGHT?

27:03.250 --> 27:05.250
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TURN THIS INTO SOME PSA

27:05.250 --> 27:07.291
ON THE PERILS OF
UNDERGRAD DRINKING.
JUST DON'T.

27:07.291 --> 27:08.792
YOU DIDN'T LET ME
FINISH, ALL RIGHT.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.291
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU DRINK.

27:10.291 --> 27:12.750
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU LATELY,

27:12.750 --> 27:15.667
AND IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE DRINKING
TO FORGET SOMETHING.

27:17.542 --> 27:20.291
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT WITH ME?

27:20.291 --> 27:21.583
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

27:24.291 --> 27:26.083
NO. I'M FINE.

27:26.083 --> 27:29.125
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING.

27:43.750 --> 27:44.917
OH, NO.
ARE YOU STILL SICK?

27:44.917 --> 27:47.792
DON'T LET THE WHEEZING
AND SNEEZING FOOL YOU.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.250
I'M FINE.
[SNIFFLES]

27:49.250 --> 27:51.000
YOU LOOK ALL GLOWIE.

27:51.000 --> 27:51.959
I SURFED.

27:51.959 --> 27:53.750
WELL, IT WASN'T
EXACTLY SURFING,

27:53.750 --> 27:55.375
BUT I DID MANAGE
TO STAY ON THE BOARD

27:55.375 --> 27:56.500
FOR A GOOD 5 SECONDS.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.667
COOL.
DID AUDREY TEACH YOU?

27:58.667 --> 28:00.333
NO. CHARLIE, ACTUALLY.

28:01.166 --> 28:03.125
YOU SPENT THE DAY
WITH CHARLIE?

28:03.125 --> 28:04.500
YEAH. IS THAT OK
WITH YOU?

28:04.500 --> 28:06.125
YEAH,
OF COURSE IT IS.

28:06.125 --> 28:06.875
I JUST...

28:06.875 --> 28:09.917
[SIGHS]
EH, I DON'T KNOW.

28:09.917 --> 28:13.125
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'D WANT TO
WASTE YOUR TIME, JO.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.834
WELL...
IT IS MY TIME.

28:15.834 --> 28:19.458
AND, ANYWAY, HE MAKES ME
LAUGH SOMETIMES.

28:19.458 --> 28:22.375
YEAH. WELL, THAT'S HOW
HE REELS YOU IN.

28:22.375 --> 28:23.834
TRUST ME, OK?
I'VE BEEN THERE.

28:23.834 --> 28:25.291
YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:25.291 --> 28:27.458
I THINK I'M GONNA GO
WITH MY INSTINCTS
ON THIS ONE,

28:27.458 --> 28:28.458
BUT THANK YOU.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.166
WELL, JOEY,

28:30.166 --> 28:32.000
WHAT ARE YOUR INSTINCTS
TELLING YOU?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.375
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
THEY'RE TELLING ME

28:34.375 --> 28:35.375
THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY
NOT THE BEST PERSON

28:35.375 --> 28:37.375
TO ADVISE ME IN THIS
PARTICULAR SITUATION.

28:37.375 --> 28:39.625
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO
SEE YOU GET HURT BY HIM.
THAT'S ALL.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.375
COME ON, JEN.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.166
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'VE
EVER HAD MY FEELINGS
IN MIND BEFORE.

28:43.166 --> 28:44.834
I MEAN, WHAT WERE
YOUR INSTINCTS
TELLING YOU

28:44.834 --> 28:46.125
WHEN YOU SLEPT
WITH DAWSON?

28:47.500 --> 28:50.208
LOOK, I KNEW THAT WAS
GOING TO BE AN ISSUE, OK--

28:50.208 --> 28:51.208
BUT YOU WENT AHEAD
WITH IT ANYWAY,

28:51.208 --> 28:52.542
AND I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING.

28:52.542 --> 28:53.834
SO WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE THE SAME COURTESY

28:53.834 --> 28:54.875
FOR ME RIGHT NOW?

28:54.875 --> 28:55.792
OK. FINE. FINE.

28:55.792 --> 28:57.125
IF HE REALLY MEANS
THAT MUCH TO YOU--

28:57.125 --> 28:58.750
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
HE MEANS TO ME YET,

28:58.750 --> 29:00.417
BUT WHAT DOES HE
MEAN TO YOU?

29:00.417 --> 29:02.041
NOTHING.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.708
THEN WHY DO YOU
CARE SO MUCH?

29:06.417 --> 29:07.625
UM...

29:09.208 --> 29:11.792
YOU LEFT YOUR KEYS
AT THE BEACH.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.125
THANKS.

29:13.125 --> 29:15.875
I'M GONNA GO BACK TO BED.
I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT GOOD.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.417
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CAN WE GO SOMEWHERE?

29:23.417 --> 29:25.041
SURE. WHERE?

29:25.041 --> 29:26.542
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

29:37.875 --> 29:39.667
I MISSED YOUR FRECKLES.

29:39.667 --> 29:41.583
HOW DID YOU GET
IN HERE?

29:41.583 --> 29:45.041
THE SNIFFLY GIRL
LET ME IN.

29:45.041 --> 29:49.250
THESE ONES RIGHT HERE,
I LOVE THERE.

29:49.250 --> 29:52.166
OK. I BET YOU
THAT YOU COULD HAVE
ANY FRECKLE

29:52.166 --> 29:55.708
YOU WANTED IN THE WORLD,
MR. MOVIE-STAR-
IN-TRAINING.

29:55.708 --> 29:57.792
HEY, DON'T SAY THAT.

29:57.792 --> 30:01.959
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK IT,
JUST DON'T SAY IT, OK?

30:03.375 --> 30:04.542
OK.

30:04.542 --> 30:08.458
SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

30:08.458 --> 30:09.959
IF I FOLLOWED YOU
TO BOSTON.

30:09.959 --> 30:11.333
WOULD WE STILL BE TOGETHER?

30:11.333 --> 30:13.333
I DON'T KNOW.

30:13.333 --> 30:16.166
WE'RE DIFFERENT PEOPLE NOW.

30:16.166 --> 30:18.250
I'M DIFFERENT.

30:20.291 --> 30:21.667
YOU DON'T SEEM
THAT DIFFERENT.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.291
JUST A LITTLE SAD,
THAT'S ALL.

30:25.291 --> 30:28.291
I'LL BE FINE.

30:28.291 --> 30:32.041
SOMETIMES I STILL WISH
WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

30:32.041 --> 30:34.333
THINGS JUST SEEMED
A LOT EASIER.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.959
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.041
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A TRICK TO THIS THING.

31:09.041 --> 31:12.250
I JUST...I CAN NEVER
REMEMBER WHAT IT IS.

31:13.625 --> 31:15.000
I'M SURPRISED
YOU BROUGHT A TENT.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.667
WELL, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE GONNA LET ME
SLEEP WITH YOU.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.542
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT ONE.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.083
YOU LOOK REALLY
BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.

31:36.875 --> 31:38.250
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

31:38.250 --> 31:41.041
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD GO.

31:41.041 --> 31:43.458
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WAIT, WAIT. NO. NO.

31:43.458 --> 31:44.375
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

31:44.375 --> 31:47.208
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M DOING HERE.

31:47.208 --> 31:48.959
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU ARE, CHARLIE.

31:48.959 --> 31:51.875
AND ALL THIS STUFF I KNOW
FOR SURE IS ALL BAD.

31:51.875 --> 31:52.959
YOU KNOW MORE THAN THAT.

31:52.959 --> 31:55.917
WE HAD--WE HAD
AN AMAZING DAY,

31:55.917 --> 31:58.291
AND THE ONLY REASON
YOU'RE QUESTIONING
ALL OF THIS

31:58.291 --> 31:59.834
IS BECAUSE OF
WHAT I DID TO JEN.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.542
WELL, YEAH, THAT'S
A BIG PART OF IT.

32:01.542 --> 32:08.250
I DID A TERRIBLE THING,
AND I WISH I HAD
NEVER DONE IT, BUT...

32:08.250 --> 32:10.625
IT DOESN'T DEFINE ME,
JOEY.

32:10.625 --> 32:12.875
IT'S NOT ALL THAT I AM.

32:16.333 --> 32:17.500
COME ON.

32:18.333 --> 32:20.250
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
HURT ANYBODY?

32:43.458 --> 32:45.959
LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT TENT.

32:52.959 --> 32:54.166
[SNORING]

33:02.542 --> 33:03.959
DAWSON LEERY!
WHOO!

33:03.959 --> 33:05.792
JACK, IS THAT YOU?

33:05.792 --> 33:08.917
CHECK ME OUT, DUDE.
WHOO! HA HA HA!

33:08.917 --> 33:10.792
HEY, MAN, BE CAREFUL UP THERE.

33:10.792 --> 33:13.125
HEY, LOOK, I CAN FLY!

33:15.291 --> 33:16.708
WHY DON'T YOU
COME DOWN FROM THERE?

33:19.125 --> 33:22.000
OK, I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

33:30.417 --> 33:32.041
JACK!

33:38.000 --> 33:38.208
JACK!

34:06.875 --> 34:10.083
HERE. PUT THAT ON.

34:20.875 --> 34:21.875
I MESSED UP, DAWSON.

34:21.875 --> 34:23.166
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, MAN.

34:27.375 --> 34:31.000
I JUST WISH--
WISH YOU COULD EVER
REWIND YOUR LIFE?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.458
[CHUCKLES] PRETTY MUCH
ALL THE TIME.

34:33.458 --> 34:38.000
I MEAN, JUST...PICK IT UP
RIGHT AFTER GRADUATION

34:38.000 --> 34:40.083
AND JUST DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.458
WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENT?

34:44.375 --> 34:46.667
I DON'T KNOW.

34:46.667 --> 34:47.708
WHY? WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

34:47.708 --> 34:49.833
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING WELL,
YOU KNOW,

34:49.833 --> 34:52.083
MAKING NEW FRIENDS,
TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS,
JUST...

34:52.083 --> 34:54.583
BUILDING THIS WHOLE NEW LIFE.

34:54.583 --> 34:55.417
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

34:55.417 --> 34:58.583
IT JUST GOT TOO HARD, MAN.
IT...

34:58.583 --> 35:00.166
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA BE THIS HARD.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.667
YOU DIDN'T THINK WHAT
WOULD BE THIS HARD?

35:04.083 --> 35:04.291
MY LIFE...

35:06.500 --> 35:07.542
COLLEGE.

35:10.917 --> 35:12.208
I'M FAILING OUT
OF SCHOOL, MAN.

35:13.667 --> 35:14.917
SERIOUSLY?

35:16.000 --> 35:19.458
YEAH. I--I GOTTA ACE
ALL MY FINALS, ALL RIGHT?

35:19.458 --> 35:21.000
I HAVEN'T READ
HALF THE STUFF.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.458
IT DOESN'T MATTER 'CAUSE I'LL
NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT.

35:23.458 --> 35:26.291
WHY? WELL...
DON'T SAY THAT.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.875
TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.625
WE'LL HELP YOU OUT
IN ANY WAY WE CAN.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.834
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S A GREAT LINE.

35:31.834 --> 35:34.083
YEAH, BECAUSE WE SAY IT
TO EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

35:34.083 --> 35:36.625
"DAWSON, YOUR DAD DIED,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:36.625 --> 35:38.667
"YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.
HEY, YOU'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH IT.

35:38.667 --> 35:39.834
WE'RE GONNA HELP YOU."

35:39.834 --> 35:42.375
YEAH. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GUYS DID.

35:42.375 --> 35:43.291
IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE WORLD.

35:50.041 --> 35:52.083
TOBEY'S GOT A NEW BOYFRIEND.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.917
I CALLED HIM THE OTHER DAY
JUST TO SAY HI.

36:00.917 --> 36:03.708
HE SEEMS SO HAPPY.

36:09.458 --> 36:10.458
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIX MY LIFE

36:10.458 --> 36:12.375
IF I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE I WENT WRONG?

36:15.083 --> 36:17.750
I JUST WANT TO GO BACK.

36:19.375 --> 36:21.375
I JUST WANT TO START OVER.
WHY CAN'T I START OVER?

36:23.166 --> 36:23.375
WHY?

36:28.500 --> 36:30.250
I JUST WANT TO START OVER.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.959
THINKIN' OF
BECOMING A ROADIE?

36:52.208 --> 36:55.417
I'VE GOT GOOD
UPPER BODY STRENGTH.

36:55.417 --> 36:57.667
I THINK I COULD HANDLE IT.

37:02.417 --> 37:06.834
PACEY...I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

37:06.834 --> 37:09.208
YOU KISSED CHRIS.

37:10.792 --> 37:12.250
YEAH.

37:12.250 --> 37:14.125
WHAT THE HELL?

37:14.125 --> 37:16.417
I HIRED A COUPLE OF P.I.s.

37:16.417 --> 37:18.375
THEY WERE TRACKING YOU,
TOOK SOME PHOTOS.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.625
WASN'T PRETTY.

37:19.625 --> 37:24.625
HMPH, DOESN'T QUITE FIGURE,
DOES IT?

37:24.625 --> 37:25.667
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

37:25.667 --> 37:27.375
YOU KNOW...

37:27.375 --> 37:29.542
SPENDING ALL THAT TIME
TRACKING ME DOWN...

37:31.625 --> 37:33.458
WOULD KINDA MEAN
THAT YOU CARE.

37:33.458 --> 37:36.375
YEAH, IT WOULD,
WOULDN'T IT?

37:36.375 --> 37:39.959
SO, DO YOU?

37:39.959 --> 37:46.333
BECAUSE WE CAN'T KEEP
GOING DOWN THIS ROAD
THAT WE'VE BEEN ON,

37:46.333 --> 37:49.041
AND IT'S NOT THAT
IT HASN'T BEEN GREAT,
BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS.

37:49.041 --> 37:49.875
AUDREY--
NO.
I NEED TO SAY THIS.

37:49.875 --> 37:51.875
NO. CAN I--

37:51.875 --> 37:53.083
WILL YOU GIVE A GIRL
A MINUTE?

37:53.083 --> 37:55.375
I AM NOT SO GOOD WITH THIS
VULNERABLE THING, OK?

37:55.375 --> 38:01.125
PACEY, I WANT TO BE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

38:01.125 --> 38:01.917
OK? OFFICIALLY.

38:01.917 --> 38:05.166
AND EXCLUSIVELY AND...

38:05.166 --> 38:09.208
UNCASUALLY, AND I WANT YOU
TO WANT THE SAME THING,

38:09.208 --> 38:10.458
BUT IF YOU DON'T--

38:10.458 --> 38:11.500
I DO.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.083
I DO.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.041
AND I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT ALL DAY.

38:18.041 --> 38:19.375
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU?

38:21.208 --> 38:22.834
I GUESS I WAS JUST
WAITING FOR MY MOMENT.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.291
WELL, HOW'S RIGHT NOW
FOR YOU?

38:25.291 --> 38:27.708
RIGHT NOW FEELS
PRETTY GOOD.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.125
AUDREY...

38:35.458 --> 38:37.166
WILL YOU BE
MY GIRLFRIEND?

38:39.291 --> 38:41.333
I WOULD LOVE TO.

38:54.333 --> 38:54.542
DAWSON?

38:56.667 --> 38:58.083
HEY, THOUGHT
THAT WAS YOU.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.917
HOW LONG
YOU BEEN HERE?

38:59.917 --> 39:02.542
I...HA HA.
I DON'T KNOW.

39:02.542 --> 39:05.834
YOU DON'T SEEM THAT
SURPRISED TO SEE ME.

39:05.834 --> 39:06.708
WANT SOME COFFEE?
I BREWED IT FRESH.

39:06.708 --> 39:08.458
NO. THANK YOU.
I ALREADY HAD SOME.

39:08.458 --> 39:10.000
UM, I JUST WANTED TO, UM...

39:10.000 --> 39:13.208
TO FIND JOEY.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.708
YEAH.

39:17.291 --> 39:20.458
LOOK, DAWSON, IF YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT
YOU AND JOEY ARE...

39:22.708 --> 39:24.792
WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING,
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

39:24.792 --> 39:29.333
YOU KNOW, PACE, I'M ON...
NO SLEEP AND ABOUT 26 HOURS'
WORTH OF DRIVING.

39:29.333 --> 39:30.667
I'M SERIOUS.
YOU GOTTA GIVE
THAT THING UP.

39:30.667 --> 39:33.083
THAT THING
THAT YOU GUYS DO
TO EACH OTHER,

39:33.083 --> 39:34.125
THE HEROES
OF BAD TIMING.

39:34.125 --> 39:36.291
YOU'VE GOT TO
GIVE THAT UP.
IT'S OVER.

39:38.917 --> 39:40.792
NO, IT'S NOT.

39:40.792 --> 39:43.500
AW, COME ON, DAWSON.
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU
GONNA DO THIS YOURSELF?

39:43.500 --> 39:44.583
HOW MANY TIMES
ARE YOU GONNA KEEP
ON COMING BACK?

39:47.041 --> 39:48.625
UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING
TO COME BACK FOR, I GUESS.

39:51.792 --> 39:54.166
SUPPOSE I WAS TO TELL YOU
THERE'S NOTHING RIGHT NOW?

39:58.959 --> 40:01.583
[SIGHS] BELIEVE ME, PACE,
SOMETIMES I WISH
THAT WAS THE CASE.

40:03.917 --> 40:05.375
BUT IT'S NOT.

40:06.959 --> 40:08.959
I CAN FEEL IT.

40:10.708 --> 40:12.875
I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN ANY OF THIS,
AND THAT'S FINE.

40:12.875 --> 40:16.291
YOU'RE THE CYNIC.
I'M THE IDEALIST.
IT'S HOW WE WORK, I GUESS.

40:16.291 --> 40:21.083
BUT WHEN I FEEL SOMETHING
THIS STRONG PULLING ME...

40:21.083 --> 40:24.625
I HAVE TO ACT ON IT.
IT'S...

40:24.625 --> 40:27.917
THE ONLY THING THAT
I KNOW HOW TO DO.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.583
SO YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHERE SHE IS?

40:41.083 --> 40:42.500
SHE'S WITH CHARLIE, DAWSON.

40:55.792 --> 41:00.250
WILL YOU HAND ME MY SOCKS?
MY FEET ARE FREEZING.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.500
YEAH.

41:02.458 --> 41:03.708
AH, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A GOOD THING

41:03.708 --> 41:04.667
I MOVED THIS TENT
INDOORS.

41:04.667 --> 41:05.667
YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST
A FEW TOES

41:05.667 --> 41:06.792
IF WE'D
STAYED ON THE BEACH.

41:06.792 --> 41:07.750
CHARMING.

41:07.750 --> 41:10.750
SO...WHERE WERE WE?

41:10.750 --> 41:15.083
SEVENTH GRADE,
THE CRIMPING IRON
INCIDENT.

41:15.083 --> 41:17.875
OOH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS STORY.

41:17.875 --> 41:18.792
[CHUCKLES]

41:18.792 --> 41:20.500
OH, DO YOU WANT A BREAK?

41:20.500 --> 41:23.792
FROM YOU, NEVER.

41:26.125 --> 41:27.291
HMM...

41:27.291 --> 41:29.708
YOU'RE GOOD
WITH THE ONE-LINERS.

41:29.708 --> 41:30.333
ALMOST TOO GOOD.

41:30.333 --> 41:31.458
TOO GOOD?
UH-HUH.

41:31.458 --> 41:34.166
UH-UH. YOU'RE
KIDDING ME.

41:34.166 --> 41:36.834
I HAVE BEEN LYING HERE
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU
ALL NIGHT,

41:36.834 --> 41:40.166
AND I STILL
HAVE NOT GIVEN YOU
A PROPER KISS.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.166
MAN, I MUST'VE LOST
MY TOUCH.

41:42.166 --> 41:45.375
I DON'T THINK SO.

41:47.959 --> 41:48.875
YOU DON'T?
