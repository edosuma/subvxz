01:50.987 --> 01:53.823
The owner of the flat discovered them
late Wednesday night.

02:13.426 --> 02:14.427
It's him.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.788
Yeah.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.641
The owner of the flat
discovered them late Wednesday night.

04:04.787 --> 04:05.997
Come on,
it's gonna go.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.707
- It's a really good one.
- Sylvia!

04:23.931 --> 04:25.371
So loud in there.

04:26.768 --> 04:27.977
Are these free?

04:28.895 --> 04:30.021
They're all yours.

04:35.568 --> 04:37.278
Football fans on trains
are the worst.

04:39.614 --> 04:40.865
Yeah.
I'm Pieter.

04:41.657 --> 04:42.783
I'm Mac.

04:43.409 --> 04:44.535
And this is Sylvia.

04:46.746 --> 04:47.997
On a tight budget, huh?

04:48.998 --> 04:50.208
Scrapbook.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.048
Nice tats, man.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.217
Thanks.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.886
I'm almost done
with both sleeves.

05:03.763 --> 05:05.139
Like a living canvas.

05:05.681 --> 05:06.849
They're beautiful.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.602
My wife appreciates art.

05:17.944 --> 05:20.071
Oh, Jesus!
Thank you.

05:21.656 --> 05:23.032
Get up.

05:23.074 --> 05:24.634
I've been
trying to call you.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.161
I want to see Kimberly.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.291
Hey, what time is it?

05:32.333 --> 05:34.710
9:00.
You look like shit.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.254
Oh, fuck.

05:37.088 --> 05:38.422
Oh, I feel like shit.

05:39.841 --> 05:41.881
Get ready,
I'll order you something to eat.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.388
Oh, okay. God damn it,
I'm not hungry. Stop.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.473
Fine. I won't get you
anything to eat.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.268
Fuck. Valerie.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.939
Get off! No!

05:56.607 --> 05:57.858
It doesn't help.

06:01.237 --> 06:02.780
I need to see her.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.285
You shouldn't.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.870
Okay?
Just trust me.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.791
Then I want to see
where it happened.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.343
Give me a minute.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.191
This is highly
unconventional.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.610
I don't give a damn.

06:40.651 --> 06:41.944
I want to see it.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.571
Just cut the tape.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.990
It is still
a crime scene.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.659
Yeah. I've been
a cop for 30 years.

06:48.701 --> 06:50.328
I know how to
walk through a crime scene.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.208
Okay.

06:57.335 --> 06:59.337
I'm afraid you'll have to
wait downstairs.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.673
We have dusted
for prints, but...

07:03.466 --> 07:05.343
It's been rented
by hundreds of people.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.306
You've questioned everyone
in these buildings?

07:10.348 --> 07:11.348
Yes.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.976
No one saw
or heard anything.

07:15.019 --> 07:16.771
There were two glasses
in the sink,

07:17.313 --> 07:18.522
only the victims' prints.

07:18.898 --> 07:20.942
No one saw anything,
no one heard anything,

07:20.983 --> 07:22.401
and there was
no forced entry...

07:23.402 --> 07:24.779
My daughter
knew the killer.

07:25.655 --> 07:28.658
She's a cop's kid, she would never
let some stranger in.

07:29.325 --> 07:30.952
We need to check
their credit cards,

07:30.993 --> 07:33.621
social media, everything.
Find out where they were.

07:33.663 --> 07:34.705
It's all in motion.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.500
Where's the blood?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.753
Their blood
was completely drained.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.112
The victims
were on the bed.

07:44.048 --> 07:46.592
The male victim's eyes
were held open with pins.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.844
His lips had something
attached to them.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.682
The female victim
was in his arms.

07:54.392 --> 07:56.592
The arms were severed
below the elbow.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.106
The left upper arm was inserted into
the male victim's mouth.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.652
Why do you think
he posed them?

08:05.152 --> 08:08.572
Because he's extremely sick,
I'd imagine.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.700
But he was
saying something.

08:11.867 --> 08:15.287
A highly organised crime scene like this
is done for a specific reason.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.422
The couple that was
murdered in Madrid,

08:26.924 --> 08:28.300
are there similarities?

08:28.342 --> 08:29.385
A few.

08:29.427 --> 08:30.928
Were they staged, Inspector?

08:30.970 --> 08:32.054
I can't say.

08:32.429 --> 08:35.683
At this stage, it's not clear whether
or not these are isolated incidents.

08:35.725 --> 08:39.227
We both know this is not
the MO of a random killer.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.066
America's
an arrogant country.

08:44.859 --> 08:46.027
I hope
I don't offend you.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.778
No.

08:48.279 --> 08:49.639
Where are you headed
actually, man?

08:50.823 --> 08:52.241
Working my way north.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.784
You?

08:53.826 --> 08:55.870
Erm...
Same. No real plans.

08:58.122 --> 08:59.665
We should all
hang out together.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.251
Pick a place
to get off.

09:04.420 --> 09:05.546
Come on,
it'll be fun.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.007
Venture into
the unknown.

09:11.135 --> 09:13.929
Let's get some drinks and then
we can discuss it. Vodka?

09:14.472 --> 09:15.473
What else?

09:21.020 --> 09:23.606
I can't believe you almost
invited him to come with us.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.941
I just didn't think,
okay? I'm sorry.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.276
Hmm.

09:27.318 --> 09:30.321
Like obviously, I'd much rather
spend every second with you.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.739
You only.
Hmm.

09:32.031 --> 09:34.700
I just thought he was a bit strange,
didn't you, Mr Randolph?

09:35.910 --> 09:38.704
You know what?
I did, Mrs Randolph.

09:47.922 --> 09:49.465
You remember
when she was eight...

09:50.758 --> 09:52.301
Karate class?

09:54.845 --> 09:56.263
She loved that class.

09:57.473 --> 09:59.934
Hmm. You mean
she loved making you proud.

10:04.313 --> 10:05.606
You couldn't just

10:06.440 --> 10:08.317
let them go to Hawaii

10:08.359 --> 10:10.152
or the Caribbean
for their honeymoon?

10:10.194 --> 10:11.195
No...

10:12.488 --> 10:13.572
You had to be the hero,

10:13.614 --> 10:15.950
buy her
the big Euro adventure.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.036
That's one of the reasons
it didn't work out,

10:19.078 --> 10:21.789
you always had to be
the one she loved the most.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.256
Why did you have to
send her here? Hmm?

10:32.591 --> 10:33.759
Why?

10:34.260 --> 10:36.387
Why did you have to
send her here?

10:36.762 --> 10:39.807
Why? Why!

10:41.100 --> 10:43.894
I just...
I feel like I'm going crazy.

10:46.856 --> 10:48.107
I'm so sorry.

10:50.401 --> 10:51.986
How did this
happen to us?

10:57.032 --> 11:00.995
One bottle of vodka,
and three cups...

11:06.417 --> 11:08.419
I guess one cup then.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.206
I...

11:46.582 --> 11:48.417
I feel like
I'm abandoning her.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.211
No. You're not.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.466
I'm here, okay?

11:55.925 --> 11:57.259
This is what I do.

12:02.932 --> 12:04.141
You'll...

12:04.558 --> 12:06.852
You'll let me know everything,
right, no matter what?

12:08.020 --> 12:09.104
Of course I will.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.359
No, you won't.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.655
I heard
everything, Jacob.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.368
Someone mutilated
our daughter.

12:25.079 --> 12:26.205
Find him.

13:54.251 --> 13:58.213
Over two weeks after the gruesome
murder of a young American couple,

13:58.255 --> 14:01.216
the Metropolitan Police
are refusing to confirm reports

14:01.258 --> 14:03.552
that a journalist,
Charles Hardwick,

14:03.594 --> 14:07.222
received a postcardwith information
on the killings days before...

14:07.473 --> 14:09.016
Sir. Get your hands off me.

14:09.058 --> 14:11.298
Give me half an hour, I'll...
I'll call you back, thanks.

14:15.189 --> 14:16.899
Would you get
Mr Kanon a coffee?

14:22.446 --> 14:23.781
Sorry about that.

14:24.365 --> 14:26.325
I'm sure he's just
trying to do his job.

14:27.618 --> 14:28.702
Yeah.

14:29.495 --> 14:31.895
Well, we're all trying to do that.
Why don't you take a seat?

14:37.836 --> 14:40.297
It's been over two goddamn weeks
since my daughter's murder.

14:42.508 --> 14:43.592
You've been
avoiding me,

14:43.634 --> 14:45.552
and I know that
you have new leads.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.887
Absolutely, we do,

14:46.929 --> 14:49.556
but nothing I can share
with a member of the public,

14:49.598 --> 14:52.101
however close they are
to the case.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.352
How about
a fellow cop?

14:54.436 --> 14:57.064
This postcard that I hear
about on the news,

14:57.106 --> 14:59.858
when I should be hearing from you...
What does it say?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.319
You know
I can't tell you that.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.701
Is that it? Is that what
you're gonna tell me?

15:09.743 --> 15:10.828
That's everything.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.041
Okay.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.170
The questions that I have
that need to be answered?

15:21.338 --> 15:23.090
I will find
the answers myself.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.385
I don't recommend
you do that.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.220
You had
your chance.

15:55.539 --> 15:59.293
Floor minus three.
Doors open.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.480
Hey.
Hi, can I help you?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.732
I'm waiting
for him actually.

17:03.774 --> 17:05.483
Me?
Charles Hardwick?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.028
You received
a postcard, right?

17:08.403 --> 17:09.863
You're on
private property.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.323
My daughter is dead.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.909
And you received a postcard
from the person that killed her.

17:14.326 --> 17:16.036
I'm not at liberty
to talk about this.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.204
Look, sir,
all I wanna know is

17:18.247 --> 17:20.540
if anyone in Madrid
received a postcard?

17:22.459 --> 17:23.794
Do you have kids?

17:26.505 --> 17:27.798
It's okay,
I'm good.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.928
I've been told that it's breaking
the law if I discuss the details.

17:33.512 --> 17:34.930
How many kids
do you have?

17:36.765 --> 17:38.892
One... Baby girl.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.939
There is nothing more special
to a father than a daughter.

17:48.819 --> 17:50.570
A Spanish reporter

17:51.154 --> 17:52.489
got a postcard
of the Prado.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.369
The victims,

17:58.912 --> 18:00.664
apparently,
they had their lips...

18:02.791 --> 18:03.959
Severed.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.183
I'm sorry,
that was our last flight.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.477
We have one leaving tomorrow
at 6:00 a.m.

18:22.519 --> 18:25.063
Yup, you have told me
this now numerous times.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.692
Listen to me.
This is a police matter.

18:29.151 --> 18:32.029
An emergency. You have to
get me on a plane.

18:32.321 --> 18:35.741
Sir, please, I've told you
that was our last flight.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.452
I know. It's your job
to be helpful, right?

18:39.077 --> 18:40.412
Be helpful.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.581
Do me a favour,
and get on your computer

18:42.623 --> 18:44.291
and find me
a connecting flight.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.626
I don't even care
where it connects from,

18:46.668 --> 18:50.047
I just can't have it be tomorrow.
I need it to be now.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.008
All other flights
are full. I'm sorry.

18:53.050 --> 18:55.260
I need
to get to Madrid.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.013
What part of that
do you not understand?

18:58.055 --> 18:59.848
Sir, you need
to calm down.

18:59.890 --> 19:03.101
I am calm! Can someone
just get me a fucking flight?

19:04.770 --> 19:05.979
Is everything
okay, madam?

19:08.106 --> 19:09.232
Perfect.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.874
Sir, you need to
come with us.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.527
Yeah.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.280
Thank you
for your help.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.829
Hi there. Can I see
your passport? Yup.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.083
Torturing yourself,
Detective.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.630
I do understand
how hard this is.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.048
Really?

19:33.799 --> 19:35.008
Do you?

19:36.176 --> 19:39.471
See, I don't think you have any idea
how hard this is.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.267
Go home
and mourn, sir.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.228
"Go home"?

19:49.356 --> 19:51.650
I'm not going anywhere
without my little girl.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.071
I am sympathetic,
Mr Kanon, I assure you...

19:56.113 --> 19:57.823
"Detective Kanon".

19:58.907 --> 20:01.785
It's Detective Kanon. And the last thing
I want is your sympathy.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.797
Your daughter's
personal belongings.

20:16.133 --> 20:19.386
Now please,
think about what I said.

21:07.976 --> 21:11.021
Reports suggest the couple
were backpacking through Europe.

21:11.062 --> 21:14.566
They had been staying at the Cathedral
youth hostel in Munich for a week.

21:14.608 --> 21:19.362
Early speculation indicates that this is
the third in a series of brutal murders.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.308
Hey!

23:14.769 --> 23:16.021
Detective Kanon.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.607
There's still
a restaurant in Munich

23:18.648 --> 23:21.109
where you can drink a cup of coffee
and smoke a cigarette.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.445
You look like
you could use both.

23:30.911 --> 23:32.787
This must be
a very painful time.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.253
Did you find
her hands?

23:42.380 --> 23:43.590
No.

23:47.302 --> 23:48.595
But there were...

23:51.348 --> 23:55.393
There were body parts
that didn't belong?

24:04.527 --> 24:07.364
Let me guess, there were
no liquor bottles at the scene,

24:08.531 --> 24:11.868
but the victims, they had high levels
of alcohol in their system.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.244
They were
probably drugged.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.376
We found traces
of cyclopentolate.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.919
It's an agent
in eye drops.

24:22.587 --> 24:26.049
And they were a young...
A young, married couple?

24:27.842 --> 24:30.845
Crazy people often obsess
about youth and beauty.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.473
But they don't all
mutilate their victims.

24:33.515 --> 24:37.102
This bastard, he's very
selective about his targets.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.187
Certainly his actions

24:39.229 --> 24:40.855
don't fit
with existing profiles.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.568
The postcard,
then the photograph.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.488
What photograph?

24:50.365 --> 24:51.908
I wish
I could tell you.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.702
Is there a photograph
of my daughter?

24:55.203 --> 24:56.246
Yes.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.789
Is she alive?

25:01.710 --> 25:02.836
I need to see it.

25:05.422 --> 25:07.173
It's already been
marked as evidence.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.758
It's part of
the London investigation.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.511
I'm sorry.

25:23.982 --> 25:27.235
The eyes. They don't
belong to the victims.

25:31.406 --> 25:32.532
Jesus!

25:51.176 --> 25:53.970
Detective Kanon,
now I have someone to question.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.354
You're wasting
your time.

26:04.314 --> 26:05.523
He's moved on.

26:47.732 --> 26:48.817
Ms Lombard,

26:48.858 --> 26:51.027
you are now part of
an ongoing investigation.

26:51.361 --> 26:53.681
It is a criminal offense
to reveal what is on the postcard.

26:54.197 --> 26:55.365
Understand?

26:56.032 --> 26:57.534
Each day your mail
will be opened

26:57.575 --> 26:59.494
by a police officer,
morning and afternoon,

26:59.536 --> 27:00.537
starting tomorrow.

27:01.204 --> 27:02.580
Okay.
Okay?

27:12.757 --> 27:14.443
Police sources have confirmed

27:14.467 --> 27:16.803
that an American journalist
living in Stockholm,

27:16.845 --> 27:18.263
received a postcard
this morning.

27:37.574 --> 27:39.367
- Good night, Ms Lombard.
- Night.

28:52.273 --> 28:53.483
Ms Lombard.

28:54.025 --> 28:55.485
What?
What do you want?

28:55.526 --> 28:58.255
My name is Detective Kanon, and I just
want to ask you about the postcard.

28:58.279 --> 29:00.198
If you're a detective,
talk to the detectives.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.325
Please, they're gonna
send you something else,

29:02.367 --> 29:03.993
and by then,
they'll be dead!

29:07.163 --> 29:09.123
Please, I just
want to help.

29:16.214 --> 29:17.507
I'm leaving you
my card.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.121
Er...
Well...

29:48.413 --> 29:50.581
Well, maybe it's fate,
running into him twice.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.668
Well, he's seen us now.
So, we don't have much choice.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.380
Hey, man. How bizarre
bumping into you!

29:57.839 --> 29:59.382
And you thought
you'd ditched me.

30:00.591 --> 30:02.760
No, God, we just... We got off
the train last minute.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.138
You were at the bar.
So... We left a note.

30:06.139 --> 30:07.265
No note.

30:08.266 --> 30:10.268
Mac, I assumed
that you...

30:10.310 --> 30:11.394
No, I left it
to you.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.398
You Americans
crack me up.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.984
Come, let's go for drink,
life's for the living.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.239
So, er, how long have you
been here for, man?

30:24.407 --> 30:25.825
A couple of days.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.702
Yeah? Us too.
Where are you staying?

30:29.037 --> 30:31.914
By the, er...
Stortorget.

30:34.042 --> 30:35.168
You?

30:35.209 --> 30:37.045
Oh... Just a place
back there.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.714
The Six, fancy.

30:41.758 --> 30:42.884
How do you know that?

30:45.345 --> 30:46.637
I'm stalking you.

30:51.392 --> 30:52.727
Ah, the bag.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.519
The first murders
were eight days apart.

31:34.852 --> 31:37.438
Munich was exactly
16 days after London.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.940
It could be a pattern.

31:38.981 --> 31:40.876
Which means there are
undiscovered victims out there.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.860
We're working closely
with the joint task force.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.071
This is a Europe-wide
investigation.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.280
You do
understand that

31:46.322 --> 31:48.741
this would explain why my daughter's
hands are still missing.

31:48.783 --> 31:51.035
Detective Kanon...
Did you hear what I just said?

31:51.077 --> 31:53.204
All our units have been provided
with the profile.

31:53.246 --> 31:55.206
Your profile
is wrong.

31:55.248 --> 31:58.334
Look, this killer's brand
of murder is very specific,

31:58.376 --> 32:00.002
extremely hard
to profile.

32:00.044 --> 32:01.671
People like him
can be charming,

32:01.712 --> 32:04.173
dynamic. I have worked
cases that are...

32:04.215 --> 32:05.758
I'm sure you are
a hotshot detective,

32:06.592 --> 32:09.303
but we don't conduct ourselves
like the American police.

32:09.345 --> 32:10.721
What the fuck
does that mean?

32:10.972 --> 32:13.132
Shoot first,
ask questions later.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.103
I don't give a rat's ass
what either of you think.

32:17.478 --> 32:19.939
You've got exactly four days
to prevent a murder.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.608
It's not personal.
I do sympathise, of course,

32:22.650 --> 32:24.527
but your objectivity has...
Fuck!

33:34.555 --> 33:37.975
Tilda, I have a human interest piece
on the killings.

33:38.601 --> 33:40.061
No.
Wait, please.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.103
I...

33:41.437 --> 33:43.064
The reporter
I interned for in Chicago,

33:43.105 --> 33:44.148
he did a similar piece

33:44.523 --> 33:46.192
and it out-sold
everything that year.

33:49.529 --> 33:51.030
So, you found it okay?

33:51.781 --> 33:53.032
Yeah.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.952
People are helpful and thank God
they speak a little bit of English.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.081
Why didn't you tell me about
your daughter last night?

34:02.416 --> 34:03.668
Because it's hard.

34:03.918 --> 34:06.379
It's not something
I want to open with.

34:09.674 --> 34:11.007
What do you
want from me?

34:12.842 --> 34:14.637
I want to know what was on
the postcard.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.183
What do you
want from me?

34:20.268 --> 34:23.228
I've been thrown into this mess,
and nobody is telling me anything.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.899
Look, I write
a weekly piece

34:27.400 --> 34:30.652
at a newspaper about being
an American living in a strange country.

34:31.404 --> 34:32.505
Why would
something like this

34:32.530 --> 34:33.572
happen to
someone like me?

34:35.866 --> 34:38.619
I'm sorry, I know it's hard
being on the outside.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.831
And I feel like that too, and...
And I want to help.

35:03.102 --> 35:06.355
So, I, erm... I contacted
this Spanish journalist

35:06.939 --> 35:09.275
and that guy Hardwick
from The Guardian.

35:09.817 --> 35:12.528
But you know,
it doesn't make much sense.

35:13.487 --> 35:15.031
I mean,
there seems to be

35:15.698 --> 35:18.534
no connection between
what we do as journalists.

35:18.826 --> 35:21.078
You know,
one covers politics,

35:21.412 --> 35:23.873
one covers finance,
one culture.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.416
And the postcards?

35:26.042 --> 35:28.169
Well, what do
we have?

35:28.753 --> 35:30.296
In Madrid, it said,

35:30.546 --> 35:32.089
"Till death
do us part."

35:32.131 --> 35:34.884
In London,
"Watch the innocent die,"

35:35.468 --> 35:38.262
in Munich it said,
"Feel the pain, see the truth."

35:38.971 --> 35:41.390
And here,
"Love will never die."

35:42.683 --> 35:45.644
And every sentence is always
followed by an ellipsis.

35:46.103 --> 35:47.313
"Dot, dot, dot".

35:47.355 --> 35:48.773
A continuation.
Yeah.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.568
He announces his arrival
in a city with the postcard.

35:53.444 --> 35:54.862
Selects a couple...

35:56.322 --> 35:58.783
Young,
newly married, happy...

36:05.998 --> 36:07.124
You like herring?

36:09.794 --> 36:11.462
It's the worst decision
I've ever made.

36:13.297 --> 36:14.590
I was trying
to be polite.

36:17.259 --> 36:18.939
Why did he say
she wasn't with him?

36:19.470 --> 36:20.971
They're very
independent people.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.474
She likes to fly,
and he likes trains.

36:24.642 --> 36:25.726
Here he comes.

36:27.645 --> 36:29.146
Mac, Sylvia,

36:29.188 --> 36:32.691
meet my wife and the artist
behind my tattoos, Nienke.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.735
It's a pleasure
meeting you both.

36:34.777 --> 36:36.570
He kept your existence
very quiet.

36:36.612 --> 36:38.114
Well, in my
husband's defence,

36:38.155 --> 36:39.573
it sounds as if
you two ditched him

36:39.615 --> 36:41.200
before he could
reveal very much.

36:43.411 --> 36:44.662
Touche.

36:45.329 --> 36:46.455
Would you like
another drink?

36:46.872 --> 36:48.124
Maybe
something stronger?

36:49.709 --> 36:51.711
Yes, we would.
Absolutely. Yeah.

36:51.752 --> 36:53.337
Okay, let's go.
Tequila!

36:59.927 --> 37:01.762
Have you guys
been to Bjorkskar yet?

37:01.804 --> 37:03.097
Is that the island?
Yes.

37:03.139 --> 37:04.473
Part of the archipelago.

37:04.724 --> 37:06.434
This time of year,
it's really something.

37:06.725 --> 37:07.893
Desolate, moody.

37:07.935 --> 37:09.735
It's just a short ferry ride.
You should come.

38:10.206 --> 38:12.833
The finger
in the wound I recognise,

38:12.875 --> 38:14.502
but the woman's hand...

38:16.504 --> 38:17.671
No.

38:27.848 --> 38:30.100
The Incredulity
of Saint Thomas.

38:31.602 --> 38:33.896
It has been depicted
by many artists.

38:33.938 --> 38:35.022
This is by Caravaggio.

38:36.023 --> 38:39.735
Thomas the Apostle,
sceptical of Jesus' resurrection.

38:40.528 --> 38:41.987
You see here,

38:42.029 --> 38:44.365
he is testing the wound
to see if it bleeds.

38:45.032 --> 38:49.453
"Unless I see the nail marks in his hands
and put my hand into his side,

38:49.495 --> 38:50.746
"I will not
believe it."

38:51.330 --> 38:53.082
Hence the phrase,
"Doubting Thomas."

38:55.459 --> 38:58.337
Saturn Devouring His Son,
by Francisco Goya,

38:58.379 --> 38:59.505
exhibited in London.

38:59.547 --> 39:00.923
Postcard said,

39:01.799 --> 39:03.384
"Watch the
innocent die."

39:05.010 --> 39:07.429
This, The Incredulity
of St Thomas,

39:07.680 --> 39:10.182
on display, right there
in that building.

39:14.270 --> 39:17.147
Why didn't you bring this to the
Stockholm task force?

39:18.190 --> 39:19.567
Because they're
by the book,

39:20.109 --> 39:21.443
and you seem...

39:23.028 --> 39:24.822
You seem open
to possibilities.

39:32.663 --> 39:33.956
Whoa, stop.

39:34.748 --> 39:35.874
I've seen him before.

39:37.084 --> 39:39.044
This woman is
moving off with him.

39:39.086 --> 39:41.422
That's not a "him".
It's a "them".

39:42.548 --> 39:44.133
Go back,
to the day before.

39:45.634 --> 39:47.970
Stop.
There they are.

39:50.306 --> 39:51.473
Come on.

39:53.017 --> 39:54.518
Pick up
your goddamn head!

40:24.882 --> 40:27.843
Forty-odd cameras and not one of them
picked up their faces!

40:28.636 --> 40:31.805
Seriously, you must
take it easy on yourself.

40:32.514 --> 40:34.558
You've gotten us somewhere,
and that's a good thing.

40:41.231 --> 40:45.653
Detective Hoglund promised me she will
include you in all intelligence going forward.

40:45.694 --> 40:47.237
Big fucking deal.

40:47.571 --> 40:50.032
Tomorrow, at this time,
another couple will be dead.

40:51.575 --> 40:54.078
Look, have them
cross-reference passports.

40:54.119 --> 40:58.248
Any couples that have been
to Madrid, London, Stockholm, here,

40:58.290 --> 41:00.250
it can't be that hard
to find them.

41:00.292 --> 41:03.879
The European Union operates a
freedom of movement agreement.

41:04.797 --> 41:06.382
We still
have porous borders.

41:07.549 --> 41:09.194
Are you telling me
there's no fool-proof way

41:09.218 --> 41:11.261
of registering people's
comings and goings?

41:11.887 --> 41:14.139
With terrorism
and the refugee crisis,

41:14.598 --> 41:17.643
some countries have reinstated
temporary controls.

41:18.102 --> 41:19.812
But generally
speaking, no.

41:23.065 --> 41:24.942
You have to let me
see all the files.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.653
You want me to retire
immediately, huh?

41:27.695 --> 41:28.821
No, I don't.

41:30.447 --> 41:31.824
I want to
help you catch them.

42:10.738 --> 42:11.739
Sylvia?

42:13.532 --> 42:14.950
Did you lose
a little thing?

42:15.492 --> 42:17.244
That's my hat.
Where did you get it?

42:17.828 --> 42:19.204
It's your
so-called note.

42:21.331 --> 42:22.458
Give it to me.
Yeah.

42:28.547 --> 42:30.007
You weirdo.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.259
You know what?
A gift.

42:35.679 --> 42:37.079
You're not gonna
get it back though.

42:38.557 --> 42:39.725
Going to keep it.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.361
Twenty-six, and twenty-three.
They're Dutch.

42:51.403 --> 42:52.696
He gave
his passport information

42:52.738 --> 42:54.531
to rent an apartment
on Kindstugatan.

42:54.573 --> 42:55.616
According to the owner,

42:56.033 --> 42:57.826
they arrived
separately from Germany.

43:00.829 --> 43:02.456
At the airport,
we have evidence

43:02.498 --> 43:04.416
she changed sterling
into Swedish krona.

43:04.917 --> 43:07.586
He has two recorded offences
for drug possession.

43:09.379 --> 43:11.256
She works at
a tattoo parlour,

43:11.298 --> 43:14.051
and has spent two years at
the Gerrit Rietveld Academie.

43:14.468 --> 43:15.677
What's that?

43:15.719 --> 43:16.762
It's an art school.

43:40.119 --> 43:41.519
Welcome.
We got jobs to do.

43:47.042 --> 43:49.122
The owner says they haven't
been here all day.

45:02.534 --> 45:03.619
This hat...

45:06.997 --> 45:08.081
It's Kimberly's.

45:09.750 --> 45:11.251
Detective Kanon,
I'm so sorry.

45:21.136 --> 45:22.429
The ears...

45:24.014 --> 45:25.557
They're from
the Munich murders.

45:27.017 --> 45:28.268
Yeah, you may be right.

45:28.936 --> 45:30.604
Somewhere, there are
undiscovered victims.

45:31.772 --> 45:34.107
This is
Antonio Canova,

45:34.608 --> 45:36.902
Psyche Revived
by Cupid's Kiss.

45:38.362 --> 45:40.155
Let me guess,
exhibited at...

45:40.197 --> 45:41.757
Here in the
Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.

45:42.824 --> 45:47.162
And it represents Cupid waking
Psyche's lifeless corpse,

45:47.621 --> 45:50.123
and reuniting
the torn apart lovers.

45:51.291 --> 45:52.584
"Love will never die."

45:53.752 --> 45:54.836
Hmm.

45:56.964 --> 46:00.968
So do you think that the ears are
supposed to represent the wings?

46:01.009 --> 46:02.177
I guess so.

46:03.178 --> 46:04.763
I also think that...

46:06.014 --> 46:07.808
Madrid is a sculpture.

46:08.475 --> 46:09.851
This one,
Rodin's The Kiss.

46:12.271 --> 46:13.522
I mean,
look at the lips.

46:13.772 --> 46:17.150
They don't actually touch,
like they were interrupted...

46:18.652 --> 46:20.112
"Till death do us part."

46:21.613 --> 46:22.698
Yeah.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.621
Messages
on the postcards...

46:31.707 --> 46:33.125
Death, pain, I...

46:34.710 --> 46:36.003
I get it, but...

46:37.254 --> 46:38.839
- But love?
- I just...

46:39.923 --> 46:41.758
I don't understand
what they're trying to say.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.763
Er, that love
is deadly,

46:46.805 --> 46:49.099
that love is painful?

46:50.183 --> 46:51.268
I...

46:53.145 --> 46:55.397
I think they're trying
to destroy joy.

46:58.525 --> 46:59.901
I'm... I'm sorry. I...

47:01.278 --> 47:02.696
I forgot
for a moment.

47:05.198 --> 47:06.283
It's okay.

47:09.411 --> 47:11.163
I just want
to bring her home.

47:14.624 --> 47:16.668
I fell asleep, God knows how.
I feel like...

47:17.461 --> 47:18.545
I haven't
slept in weeks.

47:18.795 --> 47:21.089
I get dressed
and go to the office,

47:21.131 --> 47:24.384
just so that I don't
sit at home feeling useless.

47:27.637 --> 47:30.849
I think that "useless" is exactly
how we're supposed to feel.

47:32.768 --> 47:35.395
Hey, I got to go.
I will keep you posted.

47:35.437 --> 47:36.437
I promise, okay?

47:42.444 --> 47:46.031
Okay, see, this is footage
from a storefront security camera,

47:46.073 --> 47:47.824
one block away
from the ferry terminal.

47:48.325 --> 47:49.965
So, we slowed it down
and had it enhanced.

47:56.416 --> 47:58.251
Have you got the keys?
No, you have the keys.

47:58.543 --> 47:59.795
I have a key.

48:10.013 --> 48:12.849
Erm, hi, we are checking out
of room 418.

48:13.725 --> 48:15.268
Let me get
your bill ready.

48:16.436 --> 48:18.230
Mr and Mrs Randolph.

48:18.271 --> 48:19.314
Mmm-hmm.

48:20.774 --> 48:22.442
"Mr and Mrs Randolph."

48:23.110 --> 48:24.236
I love
the sound of that.

48:24.277 --> 48:25.612
Hmm?

48:39.251 --> 48:41.336
Police! Police!

48:41.378 --> 48:42.379
What is going on?

48:44.423 --> 48:45.903
Can you tell us
what's happening?

48:47.926 --> 48:49.719
Can somebody please tell me
what's going on?

48:54.141 --> 48:55.600
Can you tell us
who they are?

48:56.226 --> 48:58.520
Yeah, that's Pieter
and Nienke, from Amsterdam.

48:59.187 --> 49:00.605
Wait, why?
Did they do something?

49:00.647 --> 49:01.887
Is that why
you brought us here?

49:06.194 --> 49:07.737
Fuck!
Jesus Christ!

49:09.239 --> 49:11.450
You took a ferry with them
to Bjorkskar.

49:17.455 --> 49:18.665
That happened there?

49:18.999 --> 49:20.000
You were with them?

49:22.085 --> 49:23.485
We have you
on surveillance footage.

49:26.673 --> 49:29.176
Yeah. Yeah, we were with them.
We... We took a ferry,

49:29.217 --> 49:31.386
we planned to
explore and stay over.

49:31.428 --> 49:33.305
But then Mac wasn't feeling well,
so we left.

49:33.680 --> 49:34.973
So you left
on the next ferry?

49:35.015 --> 49:37.076
There's something about being sick
in a foreign country,

49:37.100 --> 49:39.060
you know, it's like,
double worse.

49:39.644 --> 49:42.230
You just want to be at home
in your own bed, eating room service.

49:42.814 --> 49:44.024
We went back
to the hotel.

49:44.065 --> 49:46.902
I had chicken soup
and I barely touched it,

49:46.943 --> 49:49.613
and Sylvia had
burger and fries.

49:50.197 --> 49:52.199
Yeah, we got the ferry back.
I have a receipt.

49:52.908 --> 49:56.369
Mac always makes fun of me because
I save everything for a memory book.

49:56.828 --> 49:58.622
I can show you.
It's with my things.

49:59.247 --> 50:00.373
We will check.

50:02.292 --> 50:03.960
She seems
genuinely distressed.

50:04.336 --> 50:06.129
I agree.
He seems unsettled.

50:06.588 --> 50:07.881
Should just
play along,

50:09.132 --> 50:10.592
empathise with her.

50:11.009 --> 50:12.636
She is
a clever girl.

50:13.553 --> 50:16.056
I can see
her wheels turning.

50:16.097 --> 50:18.934
I wonder,
how you liked Madrid?

50:18.975 --> 50:21.686
Madrid?
I don't understand.

50:22.312 --> 50:23.813
Are we
making you nervous?

50:23.855 --> 50:26.399
Well, I mean, yeah.
You know, I've seen these movies.

50:27.067 --> 50:28.151
You know,

50:28.193 --> 50:31.153
Americans thrown in jail in a foreign country
for something they didn't do.

50:31.196 --> 50:34.199
There's no way these kids are responsible
for what I saw five weeks ago.

50:34.532 --> 50:36.117
No. I've never even
been to Spain.

50:36.910 --> 50:40.163
Look, we landed in Rome.
We spent a while there,

50:40.497 --> 50:43.041
then we got a train to Paris
and rented a little apartment.

50:43.416 --> 50:45.252
Do we have proof
they were in Paris?

50:46.044 --> 50:48.964
Anyone can rent an apartment
and not stay in it.

50:49.464 --> 50:50.590
He's right.

50:51.174 --> 50:52.384
What was
that, Pierce?

50:52.425 --> 50:53.593
He said
you're right.

50:53.885 --> 50:55.220
Ask her about the details.
Yes.

50:55.887 --> 50:58.515
Ask her about the details.
Make her be specific.

50:58.557 --> 51:00.475
We ate at the same
restaurant every day,

51:00.517 --> 51:01.935
Le Comptoir.

51:01.977 --> 51:03.937
If you get me my bag,
I can show you the receipts.

51:04.980 --> 51:06.648
Like I said,
I'm a bit of a collector.

51:06.690 --> 51:08.250
Yeah,
we'll have it checked.

51:08.525 --> 51:09.901
She is lying.

51:10.735 --> 51:11.861
Perhaps...
No.

51:11.903 --> 51:14.072
She's too polished,
it's rehearsed.

51:14.447 --> 51:16.533
You've got to push her harder,
trip her up.

51:17.534 --> 51:18.702
Let me in there.

51:18.743 --> 51:20.954
Detective Kanon, please,
we have a process.

51:20.996 --> 51:22.247
Your process sucks!

51:25.875 --> 51:27.377
So where did you
travel to from Paris?

51:28.044 --> 51:29.254
Luxembourg,

51:29.296 --> 51:31.923
which I did not expect to like,
but we did.

51:32.841 --> 51:35.385
The exhibits,
the museums, Notre-Dame...

51:35.427 --> 51:37.220
Not the
Notre-Dame,

51:37.262 --> 51:38.847
but, beautiful.

51:38.888 --> 51:41.308
It is possible, I mean,
maybe it is not them.

51:41.349 --> 51:44.978
No. They would have you believing that
up is down, that black is white.

51:45.729 --> 51:46.771
That girl...

51:49.357 --> 51:50.442
That girl,

51:53.612 --> 51:54.988
she killed
my daughter.

52:02.871 --> 52:04.706
I will stake
my life on it.

52:05.123 --> 52:09.085
Show me receipts
from the museums you visited.

52:09.961 --> 52:11.171
I'm really tired.

52:11.880 --> 52:13.173
Please,
have a look.

52:14.674 --> 52:15.800
Okay.

52:22.015 --> 52:23.308
I love museums.

52:27.562 --> 52:28.772
See?

52:29.898 --> 52:31.149
Forum d'art
in Luxembourg.

52:32.067 --> 52:34.587
I still don't know how any of
this is relevant to what happened.

52:35.070 --> 52:37.072
Hey, I am really trying
to be helpful here,

52:38.281 --> 52:39.741
but can we
please go now?

52:40.033 --> 52:41.159
Once again,

52:42.035 --> 52:43.995
you arrived to London.
And then?

52:44.663 --> 52:47.040
From London,
back to Luxembourg,

52:47.457 --> 52:49.876
then Czech Republic,
and now we're here.

52:49.918 --> 52:51.638
And everywhere you went,
you paid with cash?

52:52.504 --> 52:54.255
You must admit
that's not common.

52:54.547 --> 52:56.675
Do you know what credit card
companies charge in fees?

52:57.175 --> 52:59.886
It's the only way to travel
and not come back to a mound of debt.

53:00.220 --> 53:02.430
A prepared answer
for everything!

53:02.764 --> 53:04.432
Each of us lost
our parents young

53:04.474 --> 53:06.393
and we both got
a small inheritance.

53:07.435 --> 53:08.728
Being alone
in this world,

53:09.229 --> 53:10.522
it's made us
very, very close.

53:11.314 --> 53:12.524
Can we go now?

53:33.670 --> 53:35.046
Everything
they say checks out.

53:36.339 --> 53:42.303
Sylvia and Mac Randolph,
22 and 19, reside in Los Angeles.

53:43.430 --> 53:45.306
They have proof
of being in places far away

53:45.348 --> 53:47.183
from when and where
the crimes took place.

53:47.225 --> 53:49.644
They could've stopped in Paris
on their way from Madrid.

53:49.686 --> 53:50.770
But we can't
prove it.

53:50.812 --> 53:52.814
Well, hold them
until we can.

53:52.856 --> 53:55.296
But why would they go to London,
where passports are required,

53:55.567 --> 53:57.026
or book a hotel
like the Six,

53:57.068 --> 53:58.379
if they're trying to stay
under the radar?

53:58.403 --> 54:00.443
To make it appear as if they've got
nothing to hide.

54:00.989 --> 54:02.699
Their luggage
contains no match

54:02.741 --> 54:04.221
for the clothes
in the museum footage.

54:04.534 --> 54:06.619
At least
hold them overnight!

54:06.661 --> 54:08.705
I can't hold suspects
more than 12 hours

54:08.747 --> 54:11.875
without a formal arrest, which I can't
make without sufficient evidence.

54:13.418 --> 54:16.421
Best we can do is order them to remain
in Stockholm as persons of interest,

54:17.797 --> 54:20.592
mark their passports and
keep them under surveillance.

54:24.053 --> 54:26.347
I mean, have you ever
seen a file so thin?

54:27.348 --> 54:29.768
It's like until four years ago,
they didn't exist.

54:31.561 --> 54:33.980
Interpol is coordinating
with the US.

54:35.315 --> 54:37.358
If there is something
out there, they'll find it.

54:42.780 --> 54:44.032
Listen,

54:45.033 --> 54:46.701
I had this case once.

54:47.994 --> 54:52.332
The beautiful daughter of the most celebrated
architect in Germany, beaten to death.

54:54.626 --> 54:57.003
Her father hunted down
the guy who did it

54:57.045 --> 54:58.463
and shot him
12 times.

55:00.590 --> 55:03.134
Later, after the whole thing
calmed down,

55:04.302 --> 55:05.595
he shot himself.

55:07.055 --> 55:08.223
Well...

55:11.142 --> 55:13.770
I'm not real sure how you want me
to respond to that.

55:16.189 --> 55:18.358
Getting justice
won't be the end.

55:21.152 --> 55:24.322
You see, the problem is
every time I close my eyes,

55:25.198 --> 55:26.991
the image
that I see

55:27.700 --> 55:30.161
is my daughter
laying on a cold slab.

55:30.703 --> 55:32.622
And that's never
gonna go away.

55:39.546 --> 55:40.713
I have to go now.

55:43.716 --> 55:44.842
Safe travels.

55:47.804 --> 55:49.055
Wait.

55:59.941 --> 56:01.401
Think of her smiling.

56:05.864 --> 56:07.115
How did you
get this?

56:08.533 --> 56:09.742
Don't ask.

56:17.041 --> 56:21.170
It is like I am bashing my face
into a wall

56:21.212 --> 56:22.505
over and over again.

56:22.797 --> 56:25.675
Hey, it's okay.

56:26.634 --> 56:27.969
No, Val.

56:28.720 --> 56:31.014
It's not okay.
I am telling you,

56:31.055 --> 56:33.558
everyone has a history.
Everyone.

56:35.101 --> 56:37.604
But these two,
there is just nothing.

56:37.645 --> 56:40.064
It's like they're
goddamn ghosts.

56:40.982 --> 56:42.525
Maybe I can
call in a favour.

56:45.695 --> 56:47.322
Jacob?
You still there?

56:47.363 --> 56:49.657
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here.

56:51.034 --> 56:53.077
I have some influence
with the DA's office.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.540
Thanks for
doing this, Bill.

56:59.459 --> 57:01.669
People keep asking what they can
do to help, and...

57:03.046 --> 57:05.465
There really isn't anything.
But I thought,

57:06.841 --> 57:08.217
just maybe,
you might.

57:09.594 --> 57:11.721
Does the name Simon Haysmith
mean anything to you?

57:13.181 --> 57:16.392
You mean the guy who defrauded some of
the richest men on Wall Street

57:16.434 --> 57:17.828
for, like, 300 million?
Yeah, that's him.

57:17.852 --> 57:21.648
Yeah, the Feds spent a fortune
in taxpayer dollars preparing to prosecute him.

57:22.190 --> 57:23.459
They didn't have
the case they wanted,

57:23.483 --> 57:25.883
so they squeezed his employees,
his accountants, attorneys...

57:26.444 --> 57:27.945
But none of them
said anything,

57:27.987 --> 57:30.281
so, one of the biggest white-collar
criminals in history

57:30.323 --> 57:31.491
was about to walk away.

57:32.116 --> 57:33.701
What does this have to do
with Kimberly?

57:34.243 --> 57:35.846
Well, they were just about
to drop the charges

57:35.870 --> 57:37.950
when out of nowhere,
the case was just given to them.

57:37.997 --> 57:41.709
Bank account numbers in Brussels, Cayman Islands,
and so on, and so on, and so on.

57:42.251 --> 57:43.503
Somebody gave him up?

57:44.170 --> 57:45.254
Who?

57:47.840 --> 57:49.008
His son.

57:50.009 --> 57:51.552
The son of a bitch's son.

57:52.387 --> 57:54.013
Kid detests him,
wants him destroyed.

57:55.932 --> 57:58.810
Are you telling me
that Mac is Haysmith's son?

57:59.185 --> 58:00.520
Yes, I am.

58:01.813 --> 58:03.815
Do you have any idea
why he gave him up?

58:03.856 --> 58:06.275
No, not from the little bit
I've been able to access.

58:07.068 --> 58:09.862
The real story is behind a shit-load
of redactions in that file.

58:11.948 --> 58:13.241
Witness protection.

58:15.451 --> 58:17.036
Was he a minor at the time?
Yup.

58:17.996 --> 58:20.396
That's why the Bureau has kept
tight-lipped about everything.

58:22.208 --> 58:23.584
And how old
was he then?

58:24.127 --> 58:25.712
Fifteen.
And the wife?

58:26.087 --> 58:27.171
No mention.

58:27.547 --> 58:28.673
And where's Haysmith?

58:29.215 --> 58:30.800
Doing life at Osborn.

58:32.635 --> 58:34.053
Well, can you
get in to see him?

58:34.095 --> 58:35.471
Oh, I'm trying.

58:55.199 --> 58:56.492
Did you
sleep at all?

58:58.786 --> 59:00.455
You know when you look
in someone's eyes

59:01.039 --> 59:02.540
and you know
they're lying to you?

59:04.208 --> 59:05.293
They're guilty.

59:06.252 --> 59:08.671
I've never been more sure
about anything in 30 years.

59:24.228 --> 59:25.908
They've discovered
a fifth couple.

59:27.065 --> 59:28.357
Outside Amsterdam.

59:31.819 --> 59:33.654
Artist's studio,
a bit away from everything.

59:39.911 --> 59:42.163
The targeted journalist
was away on assignment.

59:44.207 --> 59:45.500
You know what
I'm gonna ask.

59:47.960 --> 59:49.212
At least
now you know.

59:54.592 --> 59:57.261
Yeah, at least
I know.

01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:23.955
She collects them.

01:00:25.081 --> 01:00:27.875
Receipts. She collects other
people's receipts!

01:00:28.376 --> 01:00:30.628
Museums,
ferries, restaurants.

01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:33.089
Physical proof
of places

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.632
they were
supposed to have been!

01:00:38.386 --> 01:00:41.597
The artist must be prepared
to sacrifice everything,

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:45.017
even life itself.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:01.576
No weakness!

01:01:01.993 --> 01:01:04.537
"Art is a wound
turned into light."

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:10.751
Room service.

01:01:11.085 --> 01:01:12.128
Come in.

01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:19.302
How are we tonight?

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:20.428
Very well,
thank you.

01:01:25.057 --> 01:01:26.184
Okay, so
they confirmed

01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:29.478
the room service order was placed
from outside the hotel.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:32.190
Apparently it's more common
than you'd think.

01:01:33.774 --> 01:01:35.318
I need to see
a detailed map.

01:01:35.985 --> 01:01:38.070
Use my computer.
I got to pee.

01:02:40.341 --> 01:02:43.469
Excuse me.
Mac and Sylvia Randolph.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.519
Detective Kanon,
do not go to that room.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.521
No, they crafted
their own alibi.

01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:55.442
You have no idea what's staring you
in the face.

01:02:57.358 --> 01:02:58.526
Do you think
he saw?

01:02:59.277 --> 01:03:00.528
Not sure.

01:03:01.112 --> 01:03:02.196
We'll take
care of it.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.217
Police! Police!

01:03:31.767 --> 01:03:32.977
They're gone.

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.774
We've marked their passports.
They can't go far.

01:03:37.148 --> 01:03:39.025
They can go anywhere
they damn well please.

01:04:18.064 --> 01:04:19.190
Jacob!

01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:27.114
Jacob, I'm sorry.

01:04:28.324 --> 01:04:29.509
I don't know
how much you read,

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:32.119
but it's not just
some tabloid expose.

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:35.331
It's about your loss and your strength
in the face of it.

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:38.918
Do what
you have to do.

01:04:39.335 --> 01:04:41.535
I don't have to do anything.
I'm not going to submit it.

01:04:45.341 --> 01:04:46.801
They got away.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.428
What?

01:04:50.346 --> 01:04:51.597
Good night, Dessie.

01:04:52.598 --> 01:04:53.766
Jacob.

01:04:58.646 --> 01:04:59.772
I'm going to bed.

01:05:06.362 --> 01:05:08.722
I mean, who knows if
Haysmith will agree to see me.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.117
I just can't sit at home
doing nothing anymore.

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.539
Valerie...
It's probably locked.

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:17.998
Right?

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:20.459
Yes.

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:25.256
Okay, should I try
the back?

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:34.932
You know, breaking and entering,
that is 10 to 15 minimum.

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:36.475
That's all?

01:05:44.108 --> 01:05:47.486
Wow, this place is massive.

01:06:01.167 --> 01:06:02.668
Just another empty room.

01:06:08.215 --> 01:06:10.176
Wait, wait, wait,
slow down. What is that?

01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:14.372
I don't know but there's a lock
on the outside. It's weird.

01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:18.267
Hello? Hello?

01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:20.519
I have called
the police!

01:06:20.853 --> 01:06:22.438
Oh, shit,
I got to call you back.

01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:27.610
We're always having trouble
with squatters,

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:29.629
what with the house being empty
for nearly four years.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:31.697
And if it's not them,
it's the press...

01:06:31.739 --> 01:06:33.699
You know, what with
what happened here.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.827
Will you forgive me?
Please forgive me.

01:06:36.869 --> 01:06:38.221
Of course.
Let me make you a coffee.

01:06:38.245 --> 01:06:39.622
Oh, you're so sweet,
thank you.

01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:41.624
I'm your new
neighbour, Nancy.

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:43.083
Oh, Valerie.
So nice to meet you.

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:44.895
I didn't really call
the police, by the way.

01:06:44.919 --> 01:06:46.003
Thank God.

01:06:47.463 --> 01:06:50.633
The boy, Simon Jr,
was friends with my son, Evan.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:54.011
He was a sweet child.
Very smart, good at sports.

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:56.642
He came over here sometimes,
to do his homework.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:07:00.893
And then something changed, around...
I don't remember exactly,

01:07:00.935 --> 01:07:02.102
maybe when
he was 10?

01:07:02.978 --> 01:07:04.104
What changed?

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.440
He kind of
went quiet.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:09.151
I knew something was wrong,
but it didn't make any sense.

01:07:09.735 --> 01:07:11.695
Not then, at least.
What do you mean?

01:07:11.946 --> 01:07:15.783
Well, Simon Sr was on two boards
with my husband,

01:07:15.824 --> 01:07:18.327
a big philanthropist
and an active member of the church.

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:21.080
His wife, Irina, was
a stay-at-home mom.

01:07:21.121 --> 01:07:22.873
Oh, she was beautiful.

01:07:22.915 --> 01:07:26.293
She looked a bit like Melania Trump,
with those big Slavic eyes.

01:07:26.919 --> 01:07:29.880
She used to be a model, I think,
from Russia originally.

01:07:30.923 --> 01:07:33.133
Mmm, more wine?

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:34.593
Oh, I shouldn't.

01:07:35.219 --> 01:07:37.638
If you want the whole story,
you most definitely should.

01:07:38.055 --> 01:07:39.098
Thank you.

01:07:41.767 --> 01:07:43.435
She loved to bake pies.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:46.647
Around Thanksgiving, she would bake
five different kinds.

01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:48.899
They seemed to be
the perfect couple.

01:07:50.276 --> 01:07:51.902
And then
she killed herself.

01:07:51.944 --> 01:07:54.613
Oh, my God. How?

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:57.032
Hanging.
The kids found her.

01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:59.368
Oh, "kids." Simon...

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:00.911
Simon had
an older sister, Marina.

01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:02.204
Ah.

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:06.000
Their father
was so strict,

01:08:06.542 --> 01:08:09.336
the kids were always,
"Yes, please" and "Thank you, ma'am."

01:08:10.379 --> 01:08:12.423
He pushed them to be the best
at everything,

01:08:12.798 --> 01:08:16.218
forever dragging them to
some art exhibition or lecture.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.470
Didn't seem to
want them to have any fun.

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:20.430
Never, ever
went on holidays.

01:08:21.682 --> 01:08:24.518
One time, Marina dripped
ice cream on her top.

01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:27.187
And Simon Sr
took her inside the house.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:30.399
And when they came out,
she wouldn't speak,

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:32.276
wouldn't say a word.

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:35.029
Did you find out
what happened?

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:41.618
I found out later, he had beaten her so hard,
she had welts on her backside.

01:08:42.703 --> 01:08:44.162
My neighbour
was cruel...

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.666
He demanded perfection from his family,
especially his children,

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:50.478
and if they didn't achieve
his high standards immediately,

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:52.087
he would
whip it out of them.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.174
I told my husband
I had suspicions,

01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:58.301
but he just told me
to mind my own business.

01:08:58.344 --> 01:08:59.553
Do you know
where they are now?

01:08:59.595 --> 01:09:01.889
Haven't seen Marina since she left
for boarding school,

01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:04.515
and I think Simon was taken by
Child Protective Services.

01:09:20.658 --> 01:09:22.242
It's a break
in the pattern.

01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:25.496
Not a married couple,
fewer days between murders,

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.831
and no real
signs of violence.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.417
Actually, Mr Melitz and Mr Riniker
were recently married.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.518
Belgium was one of the first countries
to allow same-sex marriage.

01:09:34.129 --> 01:09:35.421
This is where
it happened.

01:09:43.138 --> 01:09:45.933
We found this postcard
at the CNN offices.

01:09:45.974 --> 01:09:47.559
Wait, was there
a photograph with it?

01:09:47.935 --> 01:09:48.977
No photo.

01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:52.398
"It has come full circle."

01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:55.859
The handwriting
looks different.

01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:59.905
No photograph.
No unconnected body parts.

01:10:01.073 --> 01:10:02.241
Gay couple...

01:10:02.282 --> 01:10:03.867
You think
it's a copycat?

01:10:03.909 --> 01:10:07.079
How could the Randolphs
have left Stockholm undetected?

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:09.039
Look.

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:12.543
Bouguereau's
Dante and Virgil in Hell.

01:10:14.086 --> 01:10:16.380
Bill's got me in to see Haysmith.
I got to run.

01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:19.716
Valerie...
Yes, yes, I'll be careful.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:26.807
Bublitz sent the photos,
and also

01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:29.560
the crime scene photos
of Amsterdam.

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:32.271
Look.

01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:38.277
Wait, wait, go...
Go back.

01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:46.336
That's my
grandmother's ring.

01:10:47.369 --> 01:10:49.288
That's my
daughter's hand!

01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:50.581
I'm so sorry.

01:10:50.622 --> 01:10:52.499
That's my
daughter's hand.

01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:54.793
No.

01:10:57.629 --> 01:10:58.630
I'm sorry.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.551
My daughter's hand...

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.142
Got 15 minutes, ma'am.

01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:21.987
Forgive me
for staring.

01:11:22.029 --> 01:11:25.032
You're the first good-looking woman
I've seen in a very long time.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:30.370
Do you have a mind
to match that face?

01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:35.250
A mind brilliant enough
to get me out of here?

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:39.922
We're building a case
to launch an appeal.

01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:42.758
I found a number
of inconsistencies

01:11:43.091 --> 01:11:45.010
in the evidence
provided by your son.

01:11:46.637 --> 01:11:48.722
Did they tell you
he defiled a de Kooning?

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:52.601
Those two had everything.
Everything!

01:11:53.769 --> 01:11:55.979
You cannot buy the kind
of education they had.

01:11:57.439 --> 01:12:00.359
Respect for money
is important to you, isn't it?

01:12:00.609 --> 01:12:01.860
Of course.

01:12:04.613 --> 01:12:06.907
Listen to me
very carefully.

01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:11.620
The sins of the father
this is not.

01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:18.210
Care to elaborate?

01:12:18.836 --> 01:12:20.003
Oh!

01:12:20.045 --> 01:12:21.588
We have 15 minutes
together, Ms Kanon,

01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:24.675
can we please not spend it talking
about these ungrateful bastards?

01:12:24.716 --> 01:12:27.094
Let's talk about
politics, art.

01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:30.764
Let's talk about the late works
of the Cubists,

01:12:30.806 --> 01:12:34.518
how the Expressionists
were a reaction to fascism.

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:38.105
Or how being sent to boarding
school affects your child?

01:12:40.065 --> 01:12:41.650
What happened
to your daughter?

01:12:41.692 --> 01:12:43.026
There seems
no trace of her.

01:12:46.697 --> 01:12:50.659
We're looking for cause. Why would
Simon Jr make up stories about you?

01:12:53.078 --> 01:12:55.198
Did you know your senses get
heightened in this place?

01:12:57.583 --> 01:12:58.709
I don't know why.

01:13:00.002 --> 01:13:01.628
Perhaps it's all the noise,

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.256
followed by
the silence.

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:09.261
A father's duty is to teach,
and I did just that.

01:13:09.303 --> 01:13:13.098
I taught them culture,
ethics, morality, discipline.

01:13:13.599 --> 01:13:14.641
Is that right?

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:18.895
Oh, you're just like her.

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:24.151
Devious little bitch.

01:13:27.821 --> 01:13:30.574
Young girls
need to be just that.

01:13:32.117 --> 01:13:33.327
Young girls.

01:13:44.546 --> 01:13:45.881
You'll find them together.

01:13:47.633 --> 01:13:49.051
You can't
keep them apart...

01:13:50.594 --> 01:13:51.887
Except by force.

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.911
That's something
you're very good at.

01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:55.724
Oh, are you
judging me?

01:13:56.934 --> 01:13:58.852
Oh, I think
a court already did that.

01:13:59.978 --> 01:14:01.897
Well, society is
full of wrong decisions

01:14:01.939 --> 01:14:04.483
made by decent people.
Take me, for example.

01:14:04.775 --> 01:14:06.234
I met with you

01:14:06.652 --> 01:14:09.196
because I actually thought
you might be able to help me.

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:12.074
Well, that was a huge
error of judgement on your part.

01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:14.952
So I take it you won't be
handling my appeal.

01:14:19.039 --> 01:14:20.540
Enchante, madame.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.544
Enchante.

01:14:31.385 --> 01:14:35.972
It seems the majority of Haysmith's
rage was... Was focused on the girl.

01:14:36.223 --> 01:14:38.308
So, Marina gets sent away
to boarding school,

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:41.019
and Simon stops at nothing
to get her back.

01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:43.772
That is
one hell of a brother.

01:14:44.648 --> 01:14:45.857
Unless...

01:14:48.193 --> 01:14:49.778
Unless it's
more than that.

01:14:50.737 --> 01:14:51.905
What do you mean?

01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:56.535
Valerie said that Haysmith called Marina
"a devious bitch",

01:14:56.785 --> 01:15:00.664
but he also said something about young girls
needing to be young girls,

01:15:00.706 --> 01:15:03.125
and that it would take force
to keep them apart.

01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:08.255
Christ.

01:15:09.798 --> 01:15:11.466
Mac and
Sylvia Randolph...

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:17.973
They are Marina
and Simon Haysmith.

01:15:19.433 --> 01:15:20.642
What?

01:15:20.684 --> 01:15:23.061
I mean, our suspects that we've been
chasing across Europe,

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:25.731
they're not married, they're not...
They're not husband and wife,

01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:27.566
they are
brother and sister.

01:15:28.483 --> 01:15:30.152
Head of
Saint John the Baptist.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.529
What?

01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:37.659
Head of
Saint John the Baptist.

01:15:40.412 --> 01:15:42.956
A fitting tribute
to that sadistic bastard.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:47.085
We have to make sure
that everyone knows,

01:15:47.794 --> 01:15:49.379
and most importantly, why.

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:54.134
He took beauty and made it
cruel and ugly.

01:15:56.845 --> 01:15:58.930
Will they even let him see,
do you think?

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:03.727
I want him to see
the destruction, Marina.

01:16:06.188 --> 01:16:07.314
I want him to hurt

01:16:08.273 --> 01:16:09.691
like we did.
Hey, hey.

01:16:10.984 --> 01:16:12.069
I'm here.

01:16:14.196 --> 01:16:15.238
I'm right here.

01:16:17.365 --> 01:16:20.077
We have fucked with
his notion of perfection.

01:16:21.703 --> 01:16:24.915
That'll get inside his mind
like no incarceration can.

01:16:40.347 --> 01:16:42.432
I know I shouldn't,
but I almost feel...

01:16:44.893 --> 01:16:46.311
They're playing out
their story.

01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:50.732
Look, The Kiss,
the pain of lovers torn apart.

01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:53.318
Saturn Devouring
His Son,

01:16:53.735 --> 01:16:55.570
the father that
destroyed their lives.

01:16:57.948 --> 01:16:59.908
It all makes
horrible, twisted sense.

01:17:01.034 --> 01:17:02.619
Love, pain, death...

01:17:03.578 --> 01:17:04.830
Completion.

01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:07.415
Yeah, but the last postcard
still had an ellipsis.

01:17:10.127 --> 01:17:11.419
They're not
finished yet.

01:17:11.878 --> 01:17:14.923
The message they're sending is
that their love is valid.

01:17:16.091 --> 01:17:18.969
They are angry at the world
for not accepting them.

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:21.972
I think the murders in Brussels
were exact and purposeful,

01:17:22.013 --> 01:17:23.515
not random.
Why?

01:17:24.391 --> 01:17:28.603
Because other forms of love, for centuries
forbidden, are now accepted by most,

01:17:29.062 --> 01:17:30.272
but not theirs.

01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:36.027
To feel powerful
in the face of powerlessness.

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:38.113
Yeah, exactly.

01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:42.367
What if we took that
away from them?

01:17:42.993 --> 01:17:44.244
How do you mean?

01:17:44.286 --> 01:17:46.166
That article you were going to
write about me...

01:18:17.986 --> 01:18:22.490
My name is Dave Bennings and I'm with my brothers,
Brian and Jesse, and our partner, Peter.

01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:26.661
Simon, babe,
come here.

01:18:31.041 --> 01:18:32.792
"Over the last
two weeks,

01:18:33.335 --> 01:18:37.505
"I've had a front-row seat
to the investigation of the serial murders

01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:39.549
"dubbed 'The Postcard Killings'.

01:18:40.258 --> 01:18:43.929
"They've dominated our headlines,
but the media analysis is wrong.

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:49.643
"As odd as it sounds, these crimes are
not driven by bloodlust or cruelty.

01:18:51.061 --> 01:18:53.271
"Instead, they are
a cry for understanding..."

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:56.399
"I've had a front-row seat via
Detective Jacob Kanon,

01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:58.735
"the American father
of one of the victims.

01:18:59.694 --> 01:19:01.571
"He's an
outsider here, like me,

01:19:02.364 --> 01:19:04.574
"but he will not let
the grimness of this world

01:19:04.616 --> 01:19:07.953
"distract him from his commitment
to find justice for his daughter.

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:10.455
"Because unlike
the killers' family,

01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:13.625
"this father's love
is 100%..."

01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:15.961
"It is obvious from
the brutality of the crimes

01:19:16.002 --> 01:19:18.880
"that the killers had a
horribly abusive childhood.

01:19:20.131 --> 01:19:22.342
"The words on their postcards
have been kept guarded,

01:19:22.384 --> 01:19:24.052
"but they reveal
a rage

01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:27.764
"and passionate commitment to the validity
of their own struggle...

01:19:29.307 --> 01:19:31.309
"And that struggle
is their message.

01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:34.646
"And that message
is justice..."

01:19:35.605 --> 01:19:38.400
"But now we have heard you,
and you can stop.

01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:42.904
"This has been difficult for me,
and frightening,

01:19:44.155 --> 01:19:45.615
"but Jacob has shown me

01:19:47.325 --> 01:19:51.037
"what it means
to be really good.

01:19:51.788 --> 01:19:53.039
"A good detective,

01:19:53.999 --> 01:19:55.208
"a good father,

01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:58.336
"a good man."

01:20:07.095 --> 01:20:09.139
We make her
our final piece.

01:20:10.598 --> 01:20:12.058
She makes
everything complete.

01:20:12.392 --> 01:20:13.518
Maybe we
should stop.

01:20:15.729 --> 01:20:18.148
Get a car, disappear.
No.

01:20:19.858 --> 01:20:21.778
Maybe we should split up?
We're not splitting up!

01:20:22.235 --> 01:20:23.361
I want to
live a normal life.

01:20:23.403 --> 01:20:25.947
That's what we are doing,
creating a chance for that.

01:20:26.531 --> 01:20:28.742
Artists were judged
in their lifetimes,

01:20:29.451 --> 01:20:30.618
just as we are.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.579
My God, do you really
care about this?

01:20:33.621 --> 01:20:36.499
All I care about
is losing you.

01:20:47.719 --> 01:20:49.679
We shouldn't
have to hide anymore.

01:20:49.971 --> 01:20:52.682
I went to the police so that we didn't
have to live like this.

01:21:13.745 --> 01:21:18.708
"Thank you, Ms Lombard, for telling our story
with the meaningful heart it deserves.

01:21:19.167 --> 01:21:20.877
"The curtain is
pulled back."

01:21:22.837 --> 01:21:24.297
I don't
understand.

01:21:24.714 --> 01:21:26.800
Iron Curtain.
Mother was Russian.

01:21:27.133 --> 01:21:31.054
Irina Smirnova, she, erm,
was born in St Petersburg.

01:21:31.096 --> 01:21:33.890
She moved to the US with her parents
after the Soviet Union collapsed.

01:21:34.224 --> 01:21:35.391
My guess is
they're travelling

01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:38.269
under the name Simon
and Marina Haysmith again,

01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:39.771
using their
Russian passports.

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:42.273
Which would explain
how they left Sweden.

01:21:42.816 --> 01:21:44.567
And how they
passed across borders.

01:21:46.277 --> 01:21:50.448
If we checked, I'll bet Haysmith
is using a bank account in Brussels.

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.535
Or what if Brussels was
not to throw us off,

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:55.036
just to redirect
our thinking.

01:21:55.078 --> 01:21:57.330
No, look, we know
that they're heading northeast.

01:21:57.372 --> 01:21:59.916
They cross the border on
the other side of Helsinki,

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.001
they're damn near
in St Petersburg.

01:22:03.294 --> 01:22:05.964
If they make it to Russia,
they're virtually untouchable.

01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:07.757
No extradition treaties.

01:22:08.258 --> 01:22:10.260
Jesus. Why can't we
catch a break here?

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:14.806
A postcard turned up at a newspaper
in Paris this morning,

01:22:15.515 --> 01:22:17.892
and in Hamburg,
and in Budapest...

01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:19.060
What did they say?

01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:20.395
All the same.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.480
"Now we are reborn."

01:22:22.522 --> 01:22:23.773
With a "dot, dot, dot"?

01:22:23.815 --> 01:22:25.150
No, just a single dot.

01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:37.120
I'll loop in Hoglund and Interpol,
see if we can trace the email.

01:22:38.496 --> 01:22:40.415
There's a manhunt
across Europe.

01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:43.042
In the meantime
sit tight, my friend.

01:22:44.461 --> 01:22:45.879
Not a
chance in hell.

01:22:47.297 --> 01:22:48.631
I'm going back
to Munich.

01:22:48.965 --> 01:22:50.175
Understood.

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:51.926
You do
what is expected.

01:22:52.927 --> 01:22:54.387
I'm going to
do what's needed.

01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:08.735
I know you know
how to use this.

01:23:11.154 --> 01:23:12.864
Only you can determine
if you should.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:53.988
How far
to the Russian border?

01:23:54.239 --> 01:23:56.574
Around three hours.
There's only one road.

01:25:31.711 --> 01:25:33.338
Is it them?
Yeah, it's them.

01:26:31.771 --> 01:26:32.897
Dessie!

01:26:34.107 --> 01:26:35.149
Dessie!

01:27:20.194 --> 01:27:21.487
Morning.

01:27:25.491 --> 01:27:27.034
We knew
you'd figure it out.

01:27:28.411 --> 01:27:31.080
It was Mac's idea to mention
the curtain being pulled back.

01:27:32.707 --> 01:27:34.959
Our mother was the one good thing
in our lives.

01:27:35.001 --> 01:27:36.752
She tried to
protect us from him.

01:27:38.296 --> 01:27:40.006
But monsters
will remain monsters,

01:27:40.047 --> 01:27:41.687
no matter what you try to do
to tame them.

01:27:49.265 --> 01:27:52.477
For centuries, artists have
killed things in a moment.

01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:55.062
We reinvented that.

01:27:56.773 --> 01:27:59.442
When you wrote about the intensity
of our rage,

01:28:00.234 --> 01:28:01.527
it was
so perceptive.

01:28:04.655 --> 01:28:06.199
You were lucky
to have each other.

01:28:08.034 --> 01:28:09.952
My father wasn't
a good man either.

01:28:11.037 --> 01:28:13.247
If I'd had a brother,
it would have been easier.

01:28:13.873 --> 01:28:15.750
That man deserves
to rot in hell.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.878
Who can say how we feel is
"unacceptable"?

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.254
Love is love.

01:28:23.257 --> 01:28:24.425
I like you.

01:28:28.012 --> 01:28:29.514
So why don't you
let me go?

01:28:40.024 --> 01:28:41.609
Hey, stop, stop!

01:28:41.859 --> 01:28:43.277
I wouldn't...
Mac, this is good.

01:28:44.946 --> 01:28:46.531
Mac, stop the car.

01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:47.657
Listen...

01:28:50.326 --> 01:28:53.079
Sylvia, listen, please...
Let me go!

01:28:53.454 --> 01:28:54.705
Shh.

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:02.922
Please.

01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:06.217
I'm so cold...

01:29:06.634 --> 01:29:09.929
It won't take very long. And I promise,
you won't feel any pain.

01:29:11.055 --> 01:29:12.223
Okay?

01:29:14.058 --> 01:29:15.351
We good to go?

01:29:18.771 --> 01:29:19.855
Perfect.

01:29:22.525 --> 01:29:23.859
There they are.

01:29:23.901 --> 01:29:25.778
Modigilani's
Reclining Nude.

01:29:28.197 --> 01:29:30.491
"Art is a wound
turned into light."

01:29:47.091 --> 01:29:50.636
Look, you drink this,
you won't feel any pain. Okay?

01:29:53.347 --> 01:29:54.765
Come on.
Come on.

01:29:58.728 --> 01:30:00.187
Christ!
Fuck you!

01:30:10.531 --> 01:30:12.783
Do you think
that you can stop this?

01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:20.124
Now, one more time.

01:30:21.292 --> 01:30:23.085
Step away from her.

01:30:23.502 --> 01:30:24.822
Hands where
I can see them.

01:30:33.471 --> 01:30:34.972
Your daughter
was lovely.

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:37.058
Shut up.

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:39.518
She had the longest fingers,
so graceful.

01:30:42.355 --> 01:30:43.731
You didn't know
my daughter.

01:30:43.773 --> 01:30:45.024
You don't get
to talk about her.

01:30:45.441 --> 01:30:46.901
But she
talked about you.

01:30:48.152 --> 01:30:49.528
She talked
about you a lot.

01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:56.327
She said she wished kids had a say
in their parents' divorce.

01:30:59.622 --> 01:31:01.582
Our father
was nothing like you.

01:31:03.834 --> 01:31:05.044
But your mother...

01:31:06.879 --> 01:31:08.798
It must have really hurt
when she died, huh?

01:31:12.301 --> 01:31:14.553
He took
everything from her,

01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:17.723
till there
was nothing left.

01:31:33.864 --> 01:31:35.408
Marina,
we okay?

01:31:48.963 --> 01:31:50.172
No!

01:31:52.717 --> 01:31:53.884
No!

01:31:54.176 --> 01:31:56.137
No! No!

01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:11.652
You're not gonna
go after them?

01:32:13.154 --> 01:32:14.739
Nowhere
for them to go.

01:32:22.788 --> 01:32:24.665
Marina,
are we going home?

01:32:25.791 --> 01:32:28.377
Yes. The sun
never sets there. Never.

01:32:29.879 --> 01:32:30.963
We'll be accepted.

01:32:31.756 --> 01:32:32.965
No one can
hurt us again.

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:11.879
Hello.

01:33:11.921 --> 01:33:13.047
Hey.

01:33:14.632 --> 01:33:16.634
I was worried I wasn't gonna
get to see you again.

01:33:18.677 --> 01:33:19.845
Ready to go?

01:33:20.471 --> 01:33:21.847
Yes, I am.
Let me carry that.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:28.521
Your countrymen will be reading
the salacious details over their cornflakes.

01:33:29.897 --> 01:33:32.149
Somehow just compounds
the tragedy of it all.

01:33:32.942 --> 01:33:35.653
Haysmith has enormous amounts
of blood on his hands.

01:33:36.987 --> 01:33:38.197
And really,

01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:41.033
no family
connection at all?

01:33:42.076 --> 01:33:43.661
They were
adopted at birth

01:33:44.453 --> 01:33:46.664
three years apart,
from two different states.

01:33:47.456 --> 01:33:48.874
According to
press reports,

01:33:48.916 --> 01:33:50.751
he had this attorney
on retainer.

01:33:51.252 --> 01:33:53.629
Was very specific
on what he wanted.

01:33:53.879 --> 01:33:55.339
Sign, please.
Looks, background...

01:33:57.216 --> 01:34:00.386
Early genetic engineering
at its finest.

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:02.555
Exactly.

01:34:03.556 --> 01:34:06.851
Seemingly, he was impotent
in more than just the emotional sense.

01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:11.105
Damn, you know...

01:34:11.772 --> 01:34:13.983
Simon and Marina,
they could have gotten married,

01:34:14.692 --> 01:34:16.360
lived happily
ever after,

01:34:16.402 --> 01:34:18.070
and my daughter
and all those others...

01:34:20.698 --> 01:34:22.616
They would
still be alive.

01:34:24.577 --> 01:34:25.870
Ah.

01:34:26.871 --> 01:34:30.207
Everything is arranged,
car to the airport,

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.419
a plane to take you
to London so that you...

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:35.880
Well, you know,

01:34:37.423 --> 01:34:38.591
bring her home.

01:34:40.134 --> 01:34:41.302
Yeah.

01:34:42.303 --> 01:34:43.637
You're a good man.

01:34:44.763 --> 01:34:46.265
Thank you
for everything.

01:34:49.727 --> 01:34:51.896
And you'll let me know
when they find their bodies?

01:34:54.815 --> 01:34:56.984
It was nice to have you
with me on my last case.

01:34:59.486 --> 01:35:01.197
What will
you do tomorrow?

01:35:03.866 --> 01:35:05.242
Fire my dog walker.

01:35:09.079 --> 01:35:10.414
Don't end up like me.

01:35:11.999 --> 01:35:13.334
Find a new
beginning.

01:35:27.932 --> 01:35:29.224
We raised
a great kid.

01:35:29.975 --> 01:35:31.018
She was happy.

01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:34.229
Well, at least
we got something right.

01:35:37.983 --> 01:35:39.568
I think
we got it all right.

01:35:41.528 --> 01:35:42.738
Till we didn't.

01:35:44.907 --> 01:35:46.116
"We"?

01:35:52.873 --> 01:35:54.416
You probably don't
want to, but,

01:35:54.833 --> 01:35:56.377
people are coming
back to my place...

01:35:56.919 --> 01:35:59.964
Oh... I will see you
there in a bit.

01:36:38.002 --> 01:36:39.211
Oh, kiddo.

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:43.090
I'm gonna
miss you so much.

01:37:01.483 --> 01:37:02.568
Yeah?

01:37:08.032 --> 01:37:09.908
Haysmith?
Yeah?

01:37:10.326 --> 01:37:11.452
You got a call.

01:37:17.708 --> 01:37:18.751
Thanks.

01:37:20.210 --> 01:37:22.588
Hello? Hello?

01:37:25.507 --> 01:37:26.717
Hello?
