00:03.871 --> 00:06.240
[theme music]

00:58.192 --> 00:59.527
Hello there, Mr. Ficus.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.165
Drink up and replenish the
world with your oxygen.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.400
Mom, I told you to quit
talking to the plant.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.869
It tried to throw itself
off that stand three times

01:08.902 --> 01:10.904
last week.

01:10.938 --> 01:13.707
Well, Roseanne, so
far my little inspection

01:13.741 --> 01:18.912
has turned up mold,
cockroaches, and human hair.

01:18.946 --> 01:22.516
Unfortunately, for the
unsuspecting citizens

01:22.550 --> 01:24.518
of Lanford, it's all
within the legal limits.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.790
God, I need a break.

01:29.823 --> 01:33.994
My word, Jackie, just look
what you've done with yourself.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.664
It's hard to believe you
still haven't got a man.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.337
I've been cleaning out a
grease trap for two hours, Mom.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.773
Yeah, Mom, that's
not very nice.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.675
Jackie needs a hug.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.010
Go hug her, Jackie.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.146
Mom, you get down there
and I'll spend the day

01:52.180 --> 01:54.047
sweating over Mr. Ficus.

01:54.081 --> 01:58.018
Jackie, I do a lot more
work than you realize.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.854
In fact, I spent
the morning making

02:00.888 --> 02:04.024
a to do list of everything that
needs to be done around here.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.528
I don't see any of you
making to do lists.

02:07.561 --> 02:12.032
Well, you can cross
off, annoy daughters.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.935
Spray out garbage
cans, unclog back sink,

02:14.968 --> 02:16.670
change grease in French frier.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.307
I think you should do
that last one, Jackie.

02:19.340 --> 02:23.010
You know how tempted your
sister gets around the fries.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.712
Yeah, at Ron Bills,
we always found

02:24.745 --> 02:27.114
a prudent to put a dead
bolt on the pie carousel.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.921
Well, look, it's
Wayland and Madam.

02:38.426 --> 02:41.862
If you don't mind, I've
got more inspecting to do.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.096
Thank you.

02:43.130 --> 02:47.034
Most restaurants aren't
this cooperative.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.304
Well, I'm off to
my ceramics class.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.906
Mom, it's the
middle of your shift.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.708
Jackie, it's kiln day.

02:57.345 --> 02:59.247
Roseanne, do you
really need that chip?

03:04.385 --> 03:06.887
She's killing me, Roseanne.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.056
If you cared about me
at all, you would tell

03:09.089 --> 03:11.425
Mom to stop coming around here.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.394
Well, that brings us
to the harsh reality

03:13.427 --> 03:15.496
of our own relationship,
doesn't it?

03:15.529 --> 03:16.864
All right, OK.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.633
Neither of us is going to do
it, so we're stuck with her.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.969
What we need is a
glass of Chardonnay

03:22.002 --> 03:23.837
on a great big old rat trap.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.944
Hey, Fred, how's that big,
stupid, horrible, mean boss

03:30.978 --> 03:32.179
of yours down at the garage?

03:32.212 --> 03:35.649
Oh, man, Rosie, is he one
enormous pain in the butt.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.218
Yeah, boy is he a--

03:38.252 --> 03:40.020
wait a minute, that's
me you're talking about.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.225
Hey, what's Fred doing here?

03:45.259 --> 03:47.094
Did you know he was
coming down here?

03:47.127 --> 03:50.331
Ooh, hoo, Jackie likes Fred.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.866
I do not.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.767
Go on.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.735
You know you like him.

03:54.768 --> 03:55.836
Go ask him out.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.405
You have't been with
nobody for six months.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.306
No.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.373
Don't make me do this, Roseanne.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.842
I'm not ready to go
out with anybody yet.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.545
Oh, Roseanne, I had the
worst date with this woman

04:04.578 --> 04:05.713
last night.

04:05.746 --> 04:09.350
She was rude and awful.

04:09.383 --> 04:12.586
And then she wouldn't
even spend the night.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.454
Let me guess.

04:13.487 --> 04:18.225
All she did was talk about golf.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.493
That's it.

04:19.527 --> 04:20.928
I'm back into men this week.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.996
Are there any straight
guys in this place?

04:23.030 --> 04:25.633
Oh, well, there's Fred.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.235
Roseanne.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.037
Jeez, he looks desperate.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.805
Two buttons should do it.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.374
No, Roseanne.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.274
OK.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.409
I'll make this deal with you.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.312
If you go over there
and ask Fred out,

04:38.346 --> 04:42.115
then I will ask Mom to
become a silent partner

04:42.149 --> 04:43.517
and not come to work anymore

04:43.551 --> 04:45.319
Really?

04:45.353 --> 04:47.054
No, I can't.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.656
Well, if you
can't, I'm going to,

04:48.689 --> 04:51.359
because I still have a date
hair and it's too good to waste.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.060
OK, OK.

04:53.093 --> 04:53.894
All right, I'll do it.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.633
I'll go back to the kitchen
so you have a better chance.

05:03.771 --> 05:04.572
Dan, Fred.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.909
I don't want this to come out
the wrong way or anything,

05:08.942 --> 05:13.113
but I'd like to go out
with you some night.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.448
You could call it a date.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.017
I'd rather call it two people
getting together for food

05:17.050 --> 05:21.154
and talking about
nothing too personal

05:21.188 --> 05:24.592
in a well-lit environment,
physical contact

05:24.625 --> 05:25.826
limited to a handshake.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.628
What do you say?

05:27.661 --> 05:29.497
Well, I'd have to
ask Roseanne, but OK.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.369
Thanks for helping, Dan.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.303
Fred.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.705
Well, let me
get this straight,

05:37.738 --> 05:41.642
food, talking, shaking hands.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.777
I'm sorry, Jackie, I'm
already involved with Dan.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.115
All right, I get it.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.584
Hey, Jackie.

05:50.618 --> 05:53.020
I'd love to.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.623
OK, well, I'll give you a
call about the weekend then.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.631
So, when are you
going to talk to Mom?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.302
Oh, Jackie, it
wasn't a real deal.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.472
Come on, idiot.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.073
I had my fingers crossed
the whole time anyway.

06:13.106 --> 06:13.974
No.

06:14.007 --> 06:14.875
No take backs.

06:14.908 --> 06:15.909
I can if I want.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.277
- Can't.
- Can.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.746
- Can't.
- Can.

06:18.779 --> 06:19.379
- Can't.
- Can.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.514
- Can't.
- Can.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.515
Can't infinity.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.753
Infinity isn't allowed.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.054
- Is.
- Isn't.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.021
- Is
- Isn't.

06:28.055 --> 06:28.922
Is.

06:28.956 --> 06:29.757
Isn't.

06:34.428 --> 06:35.529
Roseanne.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.097
I saw all the animals
in the neighborhood

06:37.130 --> 06:38.365
running in circles.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.700
I guess that means your
mother will be arriving soon.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.473
Help me hold the
knife steady, Dan.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.776
I keep missing my wrists.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.278
You know, honey, if
you don't confront Bev,

06:51.311 --> 06:53.080
then Jackie won't have
to go out with Fred

06:53.113 --> 06:55.483
and I won't have
to share my friend.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.317
Well, Dan, I know
you're getting to that age

06:57.350 --> 07:01.188
where a lot of your friends
are starting to like girls.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.291
But see, that doesn't mean
they like you any less, just

07:04.324 --> 07:05.826
in a different way.

07:05.859 --> 07:09.630
Yoo, hoo, it's your mother.

07:09.663 --> 07:18.005
Ah, you step on every crack
in every sidewalk for 40 years,

07:18.038 --> 07:20.641
what the hell does it get you?

07:20.674 --> 07:24.444
Do I smell my favorite
Yankee pot roast.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.614
What's the occasion?

07:26.647 --> 07:27.548
No occasion.

07:27.581 --> 07:31.852
Dan hit a Yankee
on the way home.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.353
Well, I'll tell you what.

07:33.386 --> 07:40.227
Why don't you two relax
and, oh, I don't know, chat.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.797
Well, Jackie, I am not
feeling real chatty yet.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.333
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.570
You said this afternoon you
couldn't wait to chat with Mom.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.804
I'm going to go
check the potatoes.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.173
Well, wait, I'm not ready
for you to check the--

07:53.206 --> 07:55.275
hey!

07:55.308 --> 07:58.145
You know, there's nothing
I like more than spending

07:58.178 --> 08:01.515
time with my daughters.

08:01.549 --> 08:04.952
Yeah, same here.

08:04.985 --> 08:09.456
Um, yeah well, I guess
it is good you know,

08:09.489 --> 08:11.625
spend time together
here at home especially,

08:11.659 --> 08:15.295
because you know, well, at
work, it's not that much fun.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.930
Well, that's why
they call it work.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.034
Yeah, good one.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.073
Well, well, you know
how sometimes like

08:26.106 --> 08:28.441
when it gets really
crazy at the diner,

08:28.475 --> 08:30.611
and you're having
trouble with a coworker.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.646
And like you just
really kind of lose it

08:32.680 --> 08:35.015
and you feel like you just
want to rip their head off

08:35.048 --> 08:36.149
with your bare hands.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.051
But you know, you can't
because of health codes.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.089
Is it Nancy?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.724
Did she make a pass
at you, because I

08:43.757 --> 08:45.258
think she made one at me.

08:47.795 --> 08:48.662
No.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.597
It's not Nancy.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.235
I'm waiting to hear
you say it's Jackie.

08:58.305 --> 09:03.210
Mom, I just don't think we
should work together anymore.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.512
I hope you're not
boiling all the vitamins

09:05.545 --> 09:07.047
out of the vegetables.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.649
Mom, wait.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.350
What do you want
me to say, Roseanne?

09:10.383 --> 09:13.053
My daughter just
told me she hates me.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.154
I didn't get that far.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.794
Well, Jackie,
your sister doesn't

09:20.828 --> 09:22.529
want to work with me anymore.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.866
So from now on, I'll
just work on your shift.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.413
Mom, I think that Roseanne
probably has more to say

09:40.447 --> 09:41.548
to you, am I right, Roseanne.

09:46.319 --> 09:52.259
Well, we don't want you
to work on any shift at all.

09:52.292 --> 09:56.563
Oh, this is a team effort.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.733
Isn't there anyone here
who enjoys my company?

10:14.948 --> 10:18.518
You know, I can't remember
what color the house is.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.163
Mom, it's just that we
think you'd be happier

10:30.197 --> 10:33.000
being more like
a silent partner,

10:33.033 --> 10:35.568
because you worked for so long.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.570
You're 64.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.707
I started working at 63.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.879
God, has it only been a year?

10:45.913 --> 10:49.783
If it weren't for me, you'd
still be in debt, Roseanne.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.219
You wouldn't have
a house, Jackie.

10:52.252 --> 10:56.056
And neither of you would have
a business to kick me out of.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.424
Yeah, but Mom,
we're not saying

10:57.457 --> 11:00.928
that we don't like your money.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.262
Fine.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.733
You won't see me at the diner
ever again for any reason.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.501
Oh, come on, Mom,
don't overreact.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.503
No, no, I'll never
talk to you again.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.139
I'll never annoy you.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.707
I'll never had
anything to do with you

11:13.741 --> 11:15.075
again as long as you live.

11:19.179 --> 11:19.980
Yes!

11:33.293 --> 11:35.328
Well, I hope you're happy.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.496
Thanks, Nancy.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.531
I hope you're happy too.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.467
I just came from your
mother's and she's crying.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.136
Why, what did
you do, punch her?

11:43.170 --> 11:44.204
No, you did.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.074
You punched her in
the emotional stomach.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.910
Oh, Nancy, nothing
can make my mother cry.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.046
She thinks Old
Yeller had it coming.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.848
Well, she came to
the door and tears

11:54.882 --> 11:56.283
were running down her face.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.285
How do you explain that?
- I don't know.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.553
She pulled a nose hair.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.190
Hey, how do I look?

12:03.223 --> 12:10.130
Like an ungrateful brat of
a daughter with great shoes.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.901
Hey, Jackie, Nancy
says we made mom cry.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.036
Yeah, right.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.305
You really like my shoes?

12:18.338 --> 12:19.606
No, you guys, she was crying.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.941
I'm sure of it.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.911
And her friend, Jake, said
she's been like that for days.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.645
Really?

12:25.678 --> 12:26.847
Jackie.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.615
Well, Roseanne, this is
a really big night for me.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.917
Yeah,

12:29.950 --> 12:32.920
But I mean, what if Mom is
sitting over there crying?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.721
I can only take
one trauma a night.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.558
And tonight I'm
choosing the date.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.760
Since when did you cut
down to one trauma a night?

12:46.766 --> 12:49.102
[doorbell rings]

12:57.110 --> 13:03.016
Hey, Mom. , Mom, well, I
just stopped over to drop

13:03.050 --> 13:07.254
off the kids' school pictures.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.455
Here's this one of Becky.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.957
She was like in
the fourth grade.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.427
I probably should have
brought them by earlier,

13:14.461 --> 13:17.264
but ever since I had DJ, , you
know I've been kind of busy.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.970
OK, so I get it.
I get it, Mom.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.205
Silent partner,
very, very clever.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.074
But you know, since
we're not at work,

13:27.107 --> 13:28.976
it doesn't really apply here.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.045
Oh, well, it's
nice of you to allow

13:32.079 --> 13:34.314
me to talk in my own home.

13:34.347 --> 13:39.552
If my sentences run on too
long, please let me know.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.388
Well, that one
was pretty close.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.860
Roseanne, what
are you doing here?

13:46.894 --> 13:48.428
Well you know,
Mom, I didn't mean

13:48.461 --> 13:50.763
to hurt your feelings so bad.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.600
I'd like to apologize
for what I said to you

13:53.633 --> 13:55.702
the other night at dinner.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.670
Well, that's very
nice of you, Roseanne.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.439
Thank you.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.075
So do you forgive me?

14:02.109 --> 14:02.910
Yes, I forgive you.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.449
OK, well, let's stay in touch.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.854
Well, you don't
have to do that.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.524
If anything important
happens, you'll surely

14:17.557 --> 14:20.994
be notified as my next of kin.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.330
Knew it, you don't
really forgive me.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.564
Yes, I do.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.466
Didn't you hear me?

14:26.499 --> 14:27.334
No you don't.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.701
You never do.

14:28.735 --> 14:29.836
That's why I have
to carry around

14:29.869 --> 14:31.404
all this guilt all the time.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.140
Listen, if you're not
going to forgive me,

14:33.173 --> 14:34.641
then you're going to do
something really mean

14:34.674 --> 14:37.177
back to me to even the score.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.412
Roseanne, that's ludicrous.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.514
No, it is not ludicrous.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.616
Otherwise, I'm going to feel
guilty till the day you die.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.121
Come on, take your best shot.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.422
Give it to me right the chops.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.424
Come on, if you love me.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.726
I'm sorry, Roseanne.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.197
Unlike some people, I
don't hurt family members.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.798
Yes, you do, Mom.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.768
But you stretch it out.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.570
When I take a Band-Aid
off of my kids knee,

15:03.603 --> 15:05.138
I just pull it off all at once.

15:05.172 --> 15:08.141
But you been taking the same
damn Band-Aid off my knee one

15:08.175 --> 15:12.045
hair at a time for 40 years.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.481
How can I forgive you,
Roseanne, if you're not

15:14.514 --> 15:17.050
really sorry for what you said?

15:17.084 --> 15:19.686
I said I was sorry,
didn't you hear me?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.788
Then you want me to
come back to the diner?

15:24.857 --> 15:28.528
You know, you can
have those pictures.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.265
You uh, you don't have to
return them or anything.

15:32.299 --> 15:36.203
Well, just what I thought.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.806
Oh, Mom, of course
you can come back.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.079
Do you need me to come back?

15:50.750 --> 15:51.551
Yeah.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.691
Course.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.528
Please, we of course
need you to please

16:01.561 --> 16:05.865
come back, please, please,
would you come back, please?

16:05.898 --> 16:07.667
Thank you, Roseanne.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.138
I just needed to
hear you say that.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.006
You don't need me.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.775
I've raised two
smart, capable girls

16:15.808 --> 16:18.345
who can't get along just
fine without anyone's help,

16:18.378 --> 16:19.179
even mine.

16:21.881 --> 16:22.782
Thank you, Mom.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.290
Well, well.

16:30.323 --> 16:35.628
I guess you still eat
when you feel guilty.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.297
You had to keep
talking, didn't you?

16:45.338 --> 16:46.206
Hi.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.607
Sorry I'm late.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.409
Before you ask,
the date went fine.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.310
It was no big deal.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.146
We had a good time.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.514
What was that?

16:54.547 --> 16:55.415
What was what?

16:55.448 --> 16:56.649
That grin.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.717
I seen you grin.

16:57.750 --> 16:58.551
I didn't grin.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.056
Ooh, you slept with him.

17:03.090 --> 17:03.990
Roseanne.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.425
God, you totally did.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.127
You said you wasn't going
to have sex with him.

17:07.160 --> 17:11.231
Well, for most of the
date, we didn't have sex.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.667
Let's not talk about this now.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.768
Hey, Roseanne.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.104
Is Jackie here?

17:17.137 --> 17:20.173
Oh, so it's Jackie now, huh?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.041
I'll just check in the back.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.111
You know, flowers would
have been a nice touch.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.982
Well, since he's
your friend, Dan,

17:30.016 --> 17:31.384
if he don't treat
my sister right,

17:31.418 --> 17:35.122
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.055
OK.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.524
I'm making a big
leap here, but did

17:37.557 --> 17:39.659
Fred and Jackie do something
that's none of my business

17:39.692 --> 17:40.893
last night?

17:40.927 --> 17:43.896
Oh, right, like
you don't know.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.499
Like, he didn't come in there
swaggering this morning,

17:46.533 --> 17:49.136
like, hey, I bagged
her you know,

17:49.169 --> 17:54.374
and then, now, the other apes
you know, sit there, way to be.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.042
Whap, whap.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.945
Maybe they grab their crotch
and yell, belch to celebrate

17:58.978 --> 17:59.812
the one night stand.

18:02.449 --> 18:07.154
FYI, we don't belch for
one night stand celebrations.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.289
We expose our chest hair
and do a victory dance.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.927
Besides, he didn't
say nothing about it.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.430
This is the first
I've heard of it.

18:17.464 --> 18:21.033
No, no, believe me,
it's not you, it's me.

18:21.067 --> 18:27.340
I'm just going through a really
selfish period right now.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.008
But that's perfect.

18:29.041 --> 18:32.078
I'm going through a
doormat period right now.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.046
Look, Fred, you
had some laughs.

18:34.080 --> 18:34.947
I had some laughs.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.516
The sun came up.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.151
I'm just not ready to date yet.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.420
Well, we don't have
to call it dating.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.889
We could call it two people
getting together and having sex

18:42.922 --> 18:44.524
in a poorly lit environment.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.829
Goodbye, Fred.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.764
It was worth a shot.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.599
Ow.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.809
What the hell are you doing?

19:02.842 --> 19:04.344
Halfway through the
date, I decided I didn't

19:04.377 --> 19:05.812
want it to get too serious.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.113
Yeah, but you
had sex with him.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.849
Well, sex is about as far
as I want to go right now.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.687
OK.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.189
So let me get this, OK?

19:16.223 --> 19:19.292
You really like him, and you
had sex with him and everything.

19:19.326 --> 19:23.330
But, no, you're just going to go
ahead and one night stand him.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.064
Yep.

19:25.097 --> 19:25.898
Way to be.

19:34.907 --> 19:38.911
Leon, it's so great that you
came in like a regular person.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.413
Yeah, you know,
somehow I've actually

19:40.447 --> 19:45.017
gotten to like this rancid
concoction of grade M beef.

19:45.051 --> 19:48.555
It is good, isn't it?

19:48.588 --> 19:51.358
What do I see coming
through the door?

19:51.391 --> 19:56.128
A woman, a strong woman,
returning to triumph

19:56.162 --> 19:59.766
over the scorn of her children.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.168
Mom, you're back.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.604
That's just terrific.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.673
I haven't returned to work.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.241
Heavens, no.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.208
No?

20:09.242 --> 20:12.945
Oh, rats.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.548
Rats, rats, rats.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.284
Oh, hi, Mom.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.519
I thought about what
you said, Roseanne,

20:19.552 --> 20:20.953
and I'm taking your advice.

20:20.987 --> 20:24.591
I'm going to do something
really mean to you.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.992
That is so healthy.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.697
In fact, I'm here
to even the score.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.132
I'm going to hurt you
with one big shot.

20:33.165 --> 20:36.235
Get it, girl.

20:36.269 --> 20:40.273
Well, uh, Mom, you know
Jackie was in on it too.

20:40.307 --> 20:43.410
Since neither of you really
want me to work in the diner,

20:43.443 --> 20:45.345
I've decided to sell my share.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.746
What?

20:46.779 --> 20:49.582
Mom it's going to be really hard
to get a buyer in this market.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.918
Oh, it wasn't that hard.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.531
She just kept
lowering her price.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.866
I couldn't say no.

21:06.899 --> 21:10.403
I'm impressed, Bev.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.738
Jackie.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.273
I, I can't feel my legs.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.111
Isn't this terrific?

21:19.145 --> 21:24.684
I get all my aggression out and
it really, really hurts you?

21:24.717 --> 21:27.787
There, now Mommy made
everything all better.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.526
[music playing]
