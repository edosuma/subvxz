10:54.403 --> 10:58.407
Yeah, a piece of Bular. Why?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.617
Oh...

11:00.284 --> 11:01.202
Uh...

11:01.786 --> 11:02.620
Ooh...

11:02.703 --> 11:06.082
Stop with the looks! You always do that
when you're hiding something.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.751
[SIGHS] Sounds like a gruesome to me.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.379
- What's a gruesome?
- [BLINKY] Feeders of the dead.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.924
At the first signs of war,
they gather to await the carnage.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.552
After the bloodshed,
gruesomes would devour the troll remains

11:18.636 --> 11:20.262
left on the battlefield.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.723
They are the carrion of trolls.

11:22.807 --> 11:26.268
There haven't been any battles in Arcadia.
Why is there a gruesome here now?

11:26.352 --> 11:29.522
Because Gunmar could be out.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.942
[GASPS] I told you, Master Jim,
that's impossible.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.529
- First the blood goblins, and now this?
- How do we know for sure?

11:36.612 --> 11:40.241
The odds are beyond miniscule,
but we can investigate later.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.785
Currently, we have a gruesome
that must be dealt with.

11:42.868 --> 11:43.869
But how do we find it?

11:43.953 --> 11:46.705
What if my rock collection
was just an appetizer?

11:46.789 --> 11:50.668
He could be going for the main course.
Look! The rock show at the museum!

11:50.751 --> 11:52.878
The jewel of the collection
is some large piece

11:52.962 --> 11:54.880
that I swore looked like some troll arm.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.882
A guy found it outside
of town last week!

11:56.966 --> 11:59.009
[BLINKY] Great Gorgus!
That is a troll arm!

11:59.093 --> 12:01.387
Who could be so careless to lose an arm?

12:03.013 --> 12:04.014
Not mine.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.059
Then we're gonna be there tonight
to make our stand.

12:07.143 --> 12:11.689
There's gonna be people at the museum,
people that can't see this thing.

12:11.772 --> 12:12.773
We have to stop it.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.192
Then I know just the thing
to get rid of it.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.027
- [BARBARA] Jim, I'm home!
- I'll be right up!

12:17.111 --> 12:19.530

- Wait, My Lord!

12:39.842 --> 12:45.556
What magic is this?
How did the impure become so large?

12:45.639 --> 12:47.850
This is just a projection.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.103
Bitte, we made this for you,
My Dark Underlord.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.772
- [GUNMAR] Ah...
- Much has changed over the centuries.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.609
Today, there are
over six billion humans...

12:56.692 --> 12:59.987
- Closer to 7.4 billion.
- More to eat.

13:00.070 --> 13:04.909
Humans now live in cities,
kingdoms that stretch past the horizon.

13:04.992 --> 13:11.832
I understand the world is different,
but my plan remains unchanged!

the Trollhunter and his team.

13:34.563 --> 13:39.777

to foresee all possibilities,

but alas, Dictatious
cannot see anything.

- She? She's spoken... to you?

13:59.755 --> 14:03.634
- Tell me what you see.
- [GROWLS]

14:07.471 --> 14:10.224
- Blink, did you go to RotGut's?
- Did I ever!

14:10.307 --> 14:12.351
Feast your eyes on this!

14:12.977 --> 14:15.229
- A rock?
- Not a rock. Dwärkstone.

14:15.813 --> 14:16.939
- Dork-stone?
- Dwärkstone.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.482
- Dork-stone?
- Close enough.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.610
Dwärkstone is incredibly rare,
highly volatile,

14:21.694 --> 14:24.488
and the only guaranteed way
to expel a gruesome.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.240
All I'm hearing is "dork-stone."

14:26.323 --> 14:28.868
However you pronounce it,
how does it work?

14:28.951 --> 14:32.454
A firm shake will activate it,
but once it begins glowing... run.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.832
Goes "kaboom."

14:34.915 --> 14:38.002
[BLINKY] Now, very delicately tuck
it away and make sure it counts.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.254

that paragenetic series last time?

14:49.221 --> 14:51.849
[WOMAN] I did. They had
a whole section on metamorphic rocks.

14:51.932 --> 14:52.850
[LAUGHS]

14:52.933 --> 14:55.060
This should be easy.
There's only six people here.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.479
I know. Crazy turnout.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.983
- Okay, let's fan out and find this thing.
- [DARCI] There you are, T.P.!

15:01.066 --> 15:05.446
Oh, hey, Darce! What are you doing here?

15:05.529 --> 15:07.197
Well, the footbag tourney ended.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.075
I thought I'd join you
and little Sir Isaac.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.704
Oh, better put him to bed right now.
Looks tuckered.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.289
- Go home with Mommy.
- Really?

15:15.372 --> 15:18.250
Well, I thought we'd stay
and check out the show with you.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.669
Spend some quality family time.

15:22.171 --> 15:26.592

to the wonderful world of quartz.

to get his child to safety.
