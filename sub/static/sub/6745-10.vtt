in addition to barbecues

birthday parties,

00:35.169 --> 00:38.504

to attract murders?

00:38.506 --> 00:40.472

Our victim,
Chandler Ethan Ryan,

00:42.977 --> 00:46.045
bought this house
about two months ago.

00:46.047 --> 00:49.982
Looks like he was chased
out of the house...

00:49.984 --> 00:51.050
And...

00:51.052 --> 00:52.918
He was pulled down
off this fence

before he could get away.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.623
With a name like
"Chandler Ethan Ryan,"

00:57.625 --> 01:00.926
I'm assuming that he's not
a mob boss.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.227
Chandler is the son

01:02.229 --> 01:04.830

You mean "fry-'em Ryan"?

a security detail

01:09.703 --> 01:11.036
Uh, they're taking her
downtown right now

can notify her in person,

I'm glad his mother didn't
have to see him like this.

Okay, Mike. [ Sighs ]
This is one of those times

belongs to master Chandler here.

and shouting.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.484
Shouting? Well, do we know what
the argument was about?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.519
No, but judge Ryan only lives
three blocks from here,

02:00.521 --> 02:03.322
and she had her bedroom window
shot out last month.

02:03.324 --> 02:06.191
Do we have any idea
who did it?

02:06.193 --> 02:08.961
Uh, main suspects were members
of the fifth dynasty,

02:08.963 --> 02:12.030
a white supremacist
motorcycle gang.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.900
A bunch of drug and arms
trafficking scumbags, sir.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.168
Judge Ryan was handling a case

02:16.170 --> 02:18.003
against two fifth dynasty
higher-ups,

02:18.005 --> 02:19.338
and the shot
through her window

02:19.340 --> 02:21.640
was likely an attempt
at intimidation.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.842
Knowing fry-'em Ryan, it failed.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.078
She got court-ordered protection
the next day.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.613
Uh, it didn't extend
to her family.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.047
From what I've shot
so far, sir,

02:29.049 --> 02:30.582
it seems like someone's
taken this patio chair

02:30.584 --> 02:32.251
and thrown it
through the sliding glass door

02:32.253 --> 02:34.086
while Chandler was still
on the ladder.

02:34.088 --> 02:36.355
Now I think if you follow
the paint,

02:36.357 --> 02:38.824
it details how the fight
played out.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.693
Well, with these
two fifth dynasty higher-ups

02:41.695 --> 02:43.195
in the judge's court,

02:43.197 --> 02:44.630
I'm guessing that
they're out on bail?

02:44.632 --> 02:46.865
Yes, sir, they are.
I put a want out on them.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.067
Chandler bought this house
a couple of months ago

02:49.069 --> 02:51.103
and has been camping out
in the bedroom,

02:54.008 --> 02:57.609
Here's their wedding web site.
Cute couple.

after the wedding.

Okay.

So I found one brush
and one roller.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.452
Odds are
our victim was alone.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.955
Well, since we haven't found
another body,

03:09.957 --> 03:11.723
I'm inclined to agree with you.

03:11.725 --> 03:15.460
But painting this house himself?
Uh...

03:15.462 --> 03:18.730
I thought that the judge's son
was a lawyer.
