00:05.789 --> 00:07.814
Your brother's condition
has stabilized for the moment,

00:07.892 --> 00:09.325
but he remains
in a very deep coma.

00:09.393 --> 00:11.827
<i>The question is,</i>
<i>what is in that case</i>

00:11.896 --> 00:14.763
<i>for which people are</i>
<i>so cavalierly willing to kill?</i>

00:14.832 --> 00:16.527
The bullet severed
the line to the main rotor.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.589
That's why he crashed.

00:17.668 --> 00:19.295
Somebody shot my brother down.

00:19.370 --> 00:21.304
Whoever shot T.C.
Also shot Higgins.

00:21.372 --> 00:23.033
<i>That means</i>
<i>the case is still hot.</i>

00:23.107 --> 00:24.699
You don't think he's gonna
pull through, do you?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.299
All we can
do now is wait.

00:26.377 --> 00:29.039

T. C: <i>Okay,</i>
<i>here we are. Maui.</i>

03:14.545 --> 03:16.012
There you go.

03:16.647 --> 03:18.012
Thank you,
Mr. Calvin.

03:18.082 --> 03:20.107
Oh, hey, you're welcome.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.882
And, hey, you two, have
a wonderful life together.

03:24.521 --> 03:26.352
Thanks, we will.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.485
Good luck
with your business.

03:28.559 --> 03:29.583
Oh.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.822
Come on, honey.
Let's see the hotel.

03:31.895 --> 03:33.294
Okay, honey.

03:42.573 --> 03:44.165
Excuse me.
Yo.

03:44.575 --> 03:46.873
Is your helicopter,
by any chance, for hire?

03:46.944 --> 03:47.968
Ha!

03:48.045 --> 03:49.569
<i>Fish got to swim</i>

03:49.646 --> 03:51.637
<i>Birds got to fly</i>

03:51.949 --> 03:55.112
<i>Theodore Calvin is</i>
<i>king of the sky</i>

03:56.320 --> 03:58.584
Where do you
wanna go, mister?
No, not me.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.646
Not me at all,
but I have to
get these contracts

04:00.724 --> 04:02.817
to my business associate
on Oahu immediately.

04:02.893 --> 04:04.724
I have no time for
conventional conveyance.

04:04.795 --> 04:06.262
Hey, hey, hey,
no problem.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.195
Just give me a chance
to get a little bit of grub,

04:08.265 --> 04:09.562
take a little layover
and I'll be...

04:09.633 --> 04:10.861
Please, I'll pay you
whatever you wish.

04:10.934 --> 04:12.765
Of course, I wasn't that
hungry anyway. How about 50...

04:12.836 --> 04:13.928
Is $300 enough?

04:14.004 --> 04:16.733
It's a pleasure
doing business
with you, sir.

04:17.774 --> 04:20.209
Contracts?
And samples.
Here you are.

04:20.277 --> 04:22.177
Please hurry.
Oh, hey, I'm gone.

04:27.751 --> 04:29.116
Oh...

04:30.421 --> 04:32.514
Tell your associate in Oahu

04:32.756 --> 04:36.089
to meet me at Island Hoppers
in 55 minutes.

04:36.660 --> 04:39.128
I thought the flight
was 45 minutes?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.390
It is.

04:40.964 --> 04:43.524
But I've got to make
a stop in Molokai.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.194
It won't take any more
than 10 minutes, I promise.

04:46.270 --> 04:48.170
I'll give you an hour.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.643
<i>...know I exist</i>

04:54.711 --> 04:56.611
<i>And this you can fix</i>

04:58.649 --> 05:01.743
<i>Cupid draw back your bow</i>

05:01.819 --> 05:04.583
<i>And let your arrow flow</i>

<i>Straight to my lover's heart</i>
<i>from me</i>

05:42.960 --> 05:44.518
Mr. Calvin?

05:46.897 --> 05:48.057
Mr. Calvin.

05:48.131 --> 05:49.359
Mr. Calvin.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.627
Yes?

05:50.701 --> 05:53.465
<i>Dr. Ibold,</i>
<i>to OB 3. Dr. Ibold...</i>

05:53.537 --> 05:54.561
How's T. C?

05:54.638 --> 05:56.799
Your brother's condition
has stabilized for the moment,

05:56.874 --> 05:58.364
but he remains
in a very deep coma,

05:58.442 --> 06:01.673
and I don't know when
or if he will come out of it.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.435
If he does, will he be...

06:03.514 --> 06:05.004
It's too early to tell
about brain damage,

06:05.082 --> 06:06.174
if that's what
you were asking.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.912
He was submerged
and trapped underwater
for a very long time,

06:08.986 --> 06:10.613
was your brother.

06:11.021 --> 06:13.182
The emergency team
has treated
the other injuries,

06:13.257 --> 06:14.815
the broken bones,
the abrasions.

06:14.892 --> 06:17.122
But all we can
do now is wait.

06:17.995 --> 06:21.795
Well, I came out here
to be with him
on my vacation

06:21.865 --> 06:24.595
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.
Be with him.

06:24.668 --> 06:26.226
Have you notified
the rest of the family?

06:26.303 --> 06:27.292
Yes.

06:27.371 --> 06:28.633
And his friends?

06:28.705 --> 06:31.196
Well, no,
I don't know any of his...
- Hey, Doc.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.336
Where is he?
How is he?

06:33.410 --> 06:34.434
Hold it.
Will he be all right?

06:34.511 --> 06:35.808
Settle down a minute,
will you, please?

06:35.879 --> 06:37.346
T.C. Is
in a coma now.

06:37.414 --> 06:39.006
And his brother will
explain the rest.

06:39.082 --> 06:41.016
Right now,
I've got to go upstairs
and deliver a baby.

06:41.084 --> 06:42.415
I'll be back soon.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.643
Jerrold Calvin.

06:46.223 --> 06:48.623
I know it's kind of hard
to keep all of us
Calvins straight.

06:48.692 --> 06:50.091
I'm brother
number four.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.957
You must be
his buddies.

06:52.029 --> 06:53.724
I'm Thomas Magnum,
this is Rick Wright.

06:53.797 --> 06:54.923
How are you?
Hi, Rick.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.898
Jonathan Higgins.
Jonathan,
nice to meet you.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.457
I was on my way
to a meeting
at the Yacht Club

06:58.535 --> 06:59.968
when I heard the news
on the radio.

07:00.037 --> 07:02.733
And as much as
the hospital
was near by...

07:02.806 --> 07:04.740
Jerrold, would you
like some coffee?

07:04.808 --> 07:06.537
Yes. I'd love some,
thank you.

07:06.610 --> 07:07.941
Jerrold,
can you tell me,

07:08.011 --> 07:09.273
did the doctor
say anything else?

07:09.346 --> 07:10.973
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

07:11.048 --> 07:15.075
Well, he said
T.C. Was underwater
for a long time...

07:16.620 --> 07:18.884
<i>There's something</i>
<i>about vending-machine coffee</i>

07:18.956 --> 07:20.947
<i>that I've always</i>
<i>associated with waiting.</i>

07:21.024 --> 07:23.652
<i>That's because the only time</i>
<i>you usually drink</i>
<i>stuff like this</i>

07:23.727 --> 07:26.059
<i>is when you're at a hospital</i>
<i>or a police station</i>

07:26.129 --> 07:29.155
<i>waiting to see about a friend,</i>
<i>or sometimes a relative.</i>

07:29.232 --> 07:31.826
<i>And sometimes,</i>
<i>too many times really,</i>

07:31.902 --> 07:33.802
<i>a hospital room</i>
<i>is the only place</i>

07:33.870 --> 07:36.202
<i>you're sure to see</i>
<i>those long-Iost relatives,</i>

07:36.273 --> 07:39.800
<i>or friends that you've</i>
<i>forgotten to call or visit,</i>
<i>but should have.</i>

07:40.444 --> 07:42.002
<i>God, I hate this stuff.</i>

07:43.580 --> 07:45.377
So I said to him,
"Look, Teddy,

07:45.449 --> 07:48.646
"there's only one way
you're gonna keep from
losing your lunch money."

07:48.719 --> 07:50.687
And he said,
"Yeah, run."

07:52.322 --> 07:54.381
That doesn't sound
like T.C. To me.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.187
Well, maybe not now.

07:56.259 --> 07:58.454
You're the one
that taught him
how to box?

07:58.528 --> 08:02.020
Well, let's just say
I just started him off
in the right direction.

08:02.099 --> 08:05.227
As a matter of fact,
two years later,
T.C. Saved my butt.

08:05.302 --> 08:06.826
Now, I never will forget that.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.394
These two jokers were trying
to rob my dad's store.

08:09.473 --> 08:11.998
I was the one talking
about "let's run."

08:12.376 --> 08:13.707
T.C. Stood up to them.

08:13.777 --> 08:15.301
Well, you had
a fine example.

08:15.379 --> 08:18.473
For T.C. Is indeed a man
of exemplary character.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.406
You don't think he's gonna
pull through, do you?

08:21.485 --> 08:23.009
I never said any such thing.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.646
Then quit talking about him
like he's a saint.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.053
He's T.C.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.191
Nothing more, nothing less.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.251
And I think, Magnum,
the strain is beginning
to show on you.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.321
I was merely making
an objective observation.

08:35.399 --> 08:36.696
Nothing more,
nothing less.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.327
You missed your meeting
at the Yacht Club.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.931
Quite.

08:42.905 --> 08:46.569
Now, since everyone,
including Dr. Ibold,
has assured us

08:46.643 --> 08:48.235
that there is nothing
we can do,

08:48.311 --> 08:49.938
I suggest
we all go home.

08:50.013 --> 08:52.846
I'm sure we'll
feel much fresher
in the morning.

08:52.916 --> 08:54.543
The invitation,
of course,
extends to you.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.848
A few hours' sleep
at the estate and
a change of clothes.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.148
Oh, no, thank you.

08:58.221 --> 08:59.984
Thank you very much,
I appreciate it.

09:00.057 --> 09:02.184
I'm gonna stay here
with T.C. I'll be fine.

09:02.259 --> 09:04.227
Well, all right.
Thanks a lot.

09:09.032 --> 09:12.229
I really wanna thank you guys
for being my brother's friend.

09:12.302 --> 09:15.601
'Cause I have a feeling that
a man couldn't do any better.

09:18.742 --> 09:20.437
<i>Thomas,</i>
<i>I don't like this.</i>

09:20.677 --> 09:22.577
It's 6:00 in the morning
and you haven't been to sleep.

09:22.646 --> 09:23.635
Neither have you.

09:23.714 --> 09:26.706
Yeah, but I'm not the one
that's diving 50 phantoms
deep into the ocean.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.115
It's fathoms
and it's only 15.

09:29.186 --> 09:30.881
Well, what's that
in feet?

09:30.954 --> 09:32.114
Ninety.

09:32.189 --> 09:34.214
What, are you nuts?
Why don't you wait
for the FAA

09:34.291 --> 09:36.225
or the National Transportation
Safety Board?

09:36.293 --> 09:39.057
I mean, they're gonna be
investigating this thing
later in the day anyway.

09:39.129 --> 09:40.994
Let them check it out.
They're not
T.C.'s friends.

09:41.064 --> 09:42.190
Thomas, still,
you don't...

09:42.265 --> 09:44.130
Look, I got to know
what caused it.

09:44.201 --> 09:47.432
T.C.'s a good pilot.
He takes good care
of his machine.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.564
And since when did you become
an expert on helicopters?

09:50.640 --> 09:52.972
Since one of them
almost killed him.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.407
Besides, what else
can we do?

09:56.880 --> 09:58.177
Hey!

10:13.196 --> 10:15.096
He may be your friend,

10:15.432 --> 10:17.229
but he's my brother.

10:20.904 --> 10:22.565
Where you go, I go.

12:27.197 --> 12:28.391
Jeez.

12:32.736 --> 12:34.431
I was beginning
to get worried
about you guys.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.029
What'd you see down there?
Charlie the Tuna or what?

12:43.046 --> 12:44.877
It wasn't an accident.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.912
The bullet hit
the control pod.

12:48.718 --> 12:50.652
Come on.
How do you know that?

12:51.588 --> 12:53.647
The bullet severed the line
to the main rotor.

12:53.723 --> 12:55.315
That's why he crashed.

12:55.959 --> 12:58.154
Somebody shot my brother down.

13:06.134 --> 13:10.366
<i>The only thing worse</i>
<i>than waiting for bad news</i>
<i>is finally getting it.</i>

13:10.472 --> 13:14.067
<i>But once you do have it,</i>
<i>there's a kind of</i>
<i>strange relief.</i>

13:14.142 --> 13:17.168
<i>Because at least you're</i>
<i>in possession of something</i>
<i>you can understand.</i>

13:17.245 --> 13:20.703
<i>For instance, I understood</i>
<i>that somebody shot T.C.</i>
<i>Down from the sky.</i>

13:20.782 --> 13:23.342
<i>Now I could at least</i>
<i>try and find out who.</i>

13:23.418 --> 13:24.612
<i>Why.</i>

13:24.686 --> 13:26.745
<i>At least I wasn't</i>
<i>just waiting.</i>

13:26.821 --> 13:29.085
<i>But as far as T.C. 's condition</i>
<i>was concerned,</i>

13:29.157 --> 13:31.148
<i>all any of us could do</i>
<i>was still wait.</i>

13:31.226 --> 13:33.353
<i>And that was</i>
<i>the worst part of all.</i>

13:34.396 --> 13:35.420
Well?

13:35.497 --> 13:37.658
What'd they say?
What about T. C?

13:37.732 --> 13:38.824
Well, there's
no change.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.527
I've been here
the whole time.

13:45.206 --> 13:46.605
They listened.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.767
Lieutenant Tanaka
was real interested.

13:48.843 --> 13:51.437
The National Transportation
Safety Board
was real interested.

13:51.546 --> 13:54.606
And they're gonna
start an investigation
in two days.

13:54.683 --> 13:55.707
Two days?

13:55.784 --> 13:57.081
That's how long
it's gonna take

13:57.152 --> 13:59.143
to get the salvage equipment
to the site.

13:59.220 --> 14:02.383
You mean to tell me
that everybody's gonna sit
on their butts for two days

14:02.457 --> 14:03.856
and do nothing?

14:04.092 --> 14:05.582
Not everybody.

14:06.728 --> 14:07.990
Oh, I got you.

14:08.063 --> 14:10.861
Well, listen, whenever you're
ready to go back down again,
I'm ready.

14:10.932 --> 14:14.299
Oh, thanks, but I don't think
anybody's gonna be going
down there for awhile.

14:14.369 --> 14:16.166
Lieutenant Tanaka
put a guard on the pier.

14:16.237 --> 14:17.864
What do you propose
that we do?

14:17.939 --> 14:19.634
Find out
who did this to T.C.

14:19.708 --> 14:20.970
How?

14:21.743 --> 14:24.007
Well, since T.C.
Can't tell us,

14:24.980 --> 14:26.572
I think we're gonna
have to recreate his day.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.309
I went down to his office
and got his logs.

14:28.383 --> 14:30.317
That's where
we'll start.
We?

14:30.385 --> 14:33.047
Yes, we.
Everybody tracking down
a different lead.

14:33.121 --> 14:34.748
We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

14:34.823 --> 14:37.383
Now, who wants
to go to Maui?

14:56.077 --> 14:57.305
Thank you.

14:59.914 --> 15:01.472
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

15:01.549 --> 15:04.347
<i>The shuttle bus to Lahaina</i>
<i>and the Maui Convention Center</i>

15:04.419 --> 15:06.182
<i>will be leaving</i>
<i>in 10 minutes.</i>

15:08.857 --> 15:11.325
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yes?

15:11.393 --> 15:13.918
I wonder if you could
perhaps help me out.

15:13.995 --> 15:15.121
Sure.

15:15.196 --> 15:18.529
Could you give me
the room number
of Jack and Nora Phillips?

15:18.600 --> 15:19.965
You see...

15:21.536 --> 15:24.266
Oh, I'm sorry.
There's nobody registered
under that name.

15:25.640 --> 15:26.800
I see.

15:27.409 --> 15:30.173
But there must be
some mistake.

15:30.812 --> 15:33.042
They're honeymooners,
actually.

15:33.548 --> 15:35.243
My name is
Walter Brimecombe,

15:35.316 --> 15:37.614
and I'm the father
of the bride

15:37.686 --> 15:41.713
and, well, my daughter Nora
and her husband, Jack,

15:42.757 --> 15:44.247
checked in here last night.

15:44.325 --> 15:47.294
They were supposed to meet
Mrs. Brimecombe and me in Hana
for dinner.

15:47.362 --> 15:49.990
And then we were supposed
to go on a moonlight cruise.

15:50.065 --> 15:52.863
But when they surprisingly
didn't show up, naturally...

15:52.934 --> 15:55.596
I'm sorry, they're not here.
And they wouldn't be.

15:55.670 --> 16:00.039
You see, the hotel has been
booked solid for the past week
with a scientific convention.

16:00.108 --> 16:01.837
Are you sure
you have the right hotel?

16:01.910 --> 16:03.935
Well, of course I'm sure.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.377
I wonder
where they could be.

16:06.448 --> 16:09.474
We were so looking forward
to their honeymoon.

16:09.651 --> 16:11.551
I'm sorry,
I just don't know.

16:13.421 --> 16:16.117
With in-laws like you,
I guess I'd be
hiding out, too.

16:29.471 --> 16:30.699
Inspector Bennett,

16:30.772 --> 16:32.399
National Transportation
Safety Board,

16:32.474 --> 16:34.965
Unit 11,
Special Investigations.

16:35.143 --> 16:38.237
I'm here to interview
the witnesses
about the incident.

16:38.313 --> 16:39.678
Over there.

16:40.515 --> 16:41.504
Thanks.

16:43.351 --> 16:44.682
Say, Officer,

16:44.753 --> 16:47.278
keep your eyes open,
this ain't a flop.

16:52.093 --> 16:53.151
Yo!

16:54.796 --> 16:56.764
Hey! Anybody home?

17:05.073 --> 17:06.165
Yeah, we're home.

17:06.241 --> 17:08.300
That's great.
I gotta ask you guys
a couple of questions.

17:08.376 --> 17:10.810
Inspector Bennett, National
Transportation Safety Board

17:10.878 --> 17:12.904
Unit 12,
Special Investigations.

17:12.981 --> 17:14.811
You're here about
the chopper, huh?

17:14.883 --> 17:16.817
Well, we already
talked to the cops.

17:17.719 --> 17:19.949
Yeah, well, maybe you did,
but you didn't talk to me.

17:20.387 --> 17:23.323
Oh, big deal.
Does that mean we get
on the news again?

17:23.391 --> 17:26.258
No, but the boys
down at the department
are awful proud of you fellas.

17:26.327 --> 17:28.124
In fact,
they're gonna give you
a special commendation

17:28.195 --> 17:31.359
from the Secretary himself,
just for pulling that pilot
out of the chopper.

17:31.432 --> 17:34.424
But I'm here to talk to you
about something else.

17:35.570 --> 17:36.662
A reward?

17:38.640 --> 17:41.905
Maybe, if you can answer
a couple of questions.

17:42.610 --> 17:44.202
Yeah? Like what?

17:44.946 --> 17:48.040
We've got reason to believe
that a rifle bullet brought
down the chopper.

17:48.116 --> 17:50.107
Now, judging from the point
that it went down,

17:50.185 --> 17:53.120
the trajectory
would put the sniper
right here in this area.

17:53.188 --> 17:55.247
What I'd like to know
from you fellas is

17:55.323 --> 17:57.223
did you see
anything suspicious?

17:57.292 --> 17:59.852
Any strangers
lurking around here
right before the accident?

18:00.795 --> 18:01.955
Uh-uh.

18:02.597 --> 18:04.189
You see anybody?

18:04.632 --> 18:06.031
Uh-uh.

18:08.603 --> 18:09.763
Hey.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.533
How much you say
that reward was?

18:11.940 --> 18:14.670
Just name it, pal.
I want the guy with the gun.

18:15.410 --> 18:18.038
I'm sorry, man,
but we'll keep
thinking about it, okay?

18:24.853 --> 18:26.946
What about the people
in this next boat?

18:28.389 --> 18:30.482
Yeah, sure.
You can ask them.

18:30.792 --> 18:32.191
You better bring
an interpreter

18:32.260 --> 18:34.421
because all they speak
is Vietnamese.

18:47.742 --> 18:49.801
"I want my brother
to live."

18:51.145 --> 18:52.772
"I want my brother
to live."

18:52.847 --> 18:56.510
Remember, that's what
you told me that little kid
said to you at Bao Loc?

18:56.784 --> 19:00.083
And you saw
those two kids hiding
behind the hooch.

19:00.922 --> 19:03.516
Well, I want my
brother to live, too.

19:03.791 --> 19:05.588
Do you hear me, T. C?

19:07.161 --> 19:09.288
Please, man, don't die on me.

19:10.732 --> 19:13.030
Please, don't die on me.

19:13.635 --> 19:14.897
He won't.

19:16.137 --> 19:17.536
He won't.

19:19.207 --> 19:22.005
Look, Jerrold, why don't you
go back to the estate
for a couple of hours?

19:22.076 --> 19:23.475
You need it.

19:26.047 --> 19:27.036
No.

19:30.218 --> 19:31.708
Thanks, Rick,

19:33.087 --> 19:36.022
but I'm gonna stay here
with T.C. He needs me.

19:38.459 --> 19:40.984
Higgins brought me some stuff
to shower and shave with.

19:41.062 --> 19:42.723
I'm gonna be fine.

19:43.564 --> 19:45.088
Where's Thomas?

19:47.201 --> 19:48.498
Come here.

19:48.736 --> 19:51.933
He's still at the Coast Guard
listening to their tapes
and stuff.

19:54.475 --> 19:55.635
Oh, great.

19:55.710 --> 19:56.802
Yeah.

19:57.745 --> 19:59.645
With you finding out
nothing at the dock,

19:59.714 --> 20:02.342
I guess that means we're
just in great shape, huh?

20:03.751 --> 20:04.877
Yeah.

20:05.019 --> 20:06.782
What about Higgins?

20:07.021 --> 20:09.546
Well, he's two hours
late calling in now.

20:10.024 --> 20:12.549
Hey, maybe that means
he's on to something.

20:12.627 --> 20:14.959
With Higgins it could mean
just about anything.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.594
Look, can you excuse me
for a minute?

20:20.668 --> 20:23.262
I got to call home,
I forgot the time.

20:23.438 --> 20:24.996
I gotta call
my mom and dad.

20:25.940 --> 20:27.669
You got any change?

20:28.443 --> 20:29.774
Oh, sure.

20:34.849 --> 20:38.285
Sorry, I saw nobody
like the couple
you were talking about.

20:38.753 --> 20:39.685
But...

20:39.754 --> 20:41.483
But you took my $10.

20:41.556 --> 20:43.217
Oh, yes, thank you.

20:43.291 --> 20:44.849
And I answered
your question.

20:48.396 --> 20:50.694
No wonder he's always broke.

20:51.199 --> 20:54.066
Thank you, thank you
very much. Aloha.
Excuse me.

20:54.135 --> 20:55.568
Give me five minutes, bro.

20:55.636 --> 20:57.433
We're a little busy
today, huh?

20:57.505 --> 21:00.565
That's quite all right.
I just wanted to ask you
a question.

21:00.641 --> 21:03.303
Like what's my favorite color?
My favorite song?

21:03.378 --> 21:05.744
Hey, is this some kind of
radio quiz or something?

21:05.813 --> 21:07.212
Will I win a million bucks?

21:07.281 --> 21:11.149
Perhaps not. But, you may win
the good will of a critically
injured friend of mine

21:11.219 --> 21:12.880
and those who
care about him.

21:12.954 --> 21:16.788
It's extremely important
to us if you could perhaps
offer some assistance.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.587
Sure. What do you
wanna know?

21:18.860 --> 21:23.524
If yesterday you saw
a young honeymoon couple
enter the hotel?

21:23.698 --> 21:25.495
I'm not quite sure
exactly what...

21:25.566 --> 21:28.194
Sure, I think I saw
who you're looking for.

21:28.269 --> 21:31.898
What I mean is, we've had
nothing but these old,
fuddy-duddy scientists

21:31.973 --> 21:33.440
in here for a week flat

21:33.508 --> 21:36.477
and anybody under 80
kind of sticks in my mind.

21:36.544 --> 21:38.978
That's probably why
they split the scene.
- <i>Dr. Einstein...</i>

21:39.047 --> 21:40.412
I beg your pardon?

21:40.481 --> 21:42.381
Well they came inside

21:42.450 --> 21:44.247
and I said, "Hey,
let me take your bags."

21:44.318 --> 21:46.377
They said, "No, thanks,"
grabbed them off the cart

21:46.454 --> 21:48.149
and stood by the fountain
for 10 minutes,

21:48.222 --> 21:50.019
until some guy came
and picked them up.

21:50.992 --> 21:53.426
What did this guy
look like?

21:53.895 --> 21:57.296
Just a <i>guy. Haole.</i>
I guess around 40.

21:57.365 --> 22:00.391
He was wearing a white suit
and a wimpy purple tie.

22:00.468 --> 22:01.867
Kind of talked like you.

22:01.936 --> 22:02.903
I see.

22:02.970 --> 22:04.835
They said they were
at the wrong hotel.

22:04.906 --> 22:08.808
Said they meant
to go to the...
To the Coconut Coast.

22:09.610 --> 22:11.202
You are sure?

22:11.546 --> 22:13.309
Of course, I'm sure.

22:13.815 --> 22:15.146
One moment.

22:15.216 --> 22:18.743
Why are you so sure?
You see hundreds of people
come and go every day.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.487
How did you remember them?

22:21.556 --> 22:23.751
Because
they tipped me anyway.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.617
Capital!

22:54.738 --> 22:56.763
Will you shut
this blasted thing off?

22:56.840 --> 22:58.102
We can't shut it off.

22:58.175 --> 22:59.267
Why not?

22:59.343 --> 23:01.243
Insurance regulations.

23:01.311 --> 23:05.042
Besides, we're obligated
under the Hippocratic oath

23:05.682 --> 23:10.176
to make use of every faculty
of modern science available
to us in your treatment.

23:10.253 --> 23:12.221
This isn't treatment,
it's torture.
Hmm.

23:12.289 --> 23:16.453
Much more of this incessantly
shrill sound and I shall
surely go stark raving mad.

23:16.526 --> 23:20.462
Well, don't blame me.
You're the one who insisted
upon being flown back

23:20.530 --> 23:22.327
so you could be
in my care.

23:22.399 --> 23:23.388
Hardly.

23:23.467 --> 23:27.403
I merely wanted to be
in close proximity to T.C.
In case his condition changed.

23:27.471 --> 23:29.837
And I wouldn't, by any
stretch of the imagination,

23:29.906 --> 23:31.533
characterize this
as "care." I would...

23:31.608 --> 23:33.769
Higgins, will you
please lighten up,
you've been shot.

23:33.844 --> 23:36.278
Now, were you able...
It's not the first time
I've tasted lead, either.

23:36.346 --> 23:38.678
I remember
one time in Kenya,
much worse than this.

23:38.749 --> 23:41.650
I was on safari,
carefully stalking
a herd of white rhino

23:41.718 --> 23:42.810
for more than three hours.

23:42.886 --> 23:44.285
The only thing was that,
unbeknownst to me,

23:44.354 --> 23:47.118
another hunter was
approaching the herd
from the upwind side.

23:47.190 --> 23:49.021
Higgins, were you able to
get a look at who shot you?

23:49.092 --> 23:50.855
Of course, I was.
He was a Belgian chap

23:50.927 --> 23:53.623
who hadn't the foggiest
notion of the etiquette
of big game hunting.

23:53.697 --> 23:54.721
Needless to say...

23:54.798 --> 23:57.733
On Maui, Higgins!
On Maui! Who shot you?

23:57.801 --> 23:58.961
How would I know?

23:59.036 --> 24:02.028
The blackguards ambushed me
from the side of the road.

24:02.105 --> 24:05.506
Now, about this Belgian chap,
his name was Francois Fornier,

24:05.575 --> 24:08.669
and despite the fact
that he had a quite
severe asthmatic condition,

24:08.745 --> 24:12.044
he was able to carry me
on his back for four days

24:12.215 --> 24:14.149
back to the base camp.

24:14.217 --> 24:15.548
Of course,

24:16.486 --> 24:18.215
by the time

24:20.824 --> 24:22.314
we got there...

24:25.862 --> 24:27.386
Right on time.

24:27.464 --> 24:29.489
Hey, Doc, he's gonna be
all right, isn't he?

24:29.566 --> 24:30.897
He should.

24:31.501 --> 24:35.198
There was
considerable blood loss,
but it was a clean wound.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.440
What about T. C?

24:38.675 --> 24:40.142
I don't know.

24:40.544 --> 24:43.012
I just left Magnum
and Jerrold

24:43.947 --> 24:46.643
and that situation
is not quite as clean.

24:47.150 --> 24:50.085
For the moment,
all we can do
is wait it out.

24:50.153 --> 24:52.621
Wait a second.
What does that mean,
"for the moment"?

24:52.689 --> 24:55.749
He'll either
come out of the coma
on his own or he won't.

24:55.826 --> 24:58.920
Sooner or later,
decisions will
have to be made.

25:06.336 --> 25:08.600
<i>I'm real tired</i>
<i>of waiting, Thomas.</i>

25:09.106 --> 25:10.300
I got to do something.

25:10.841 --> 25:13.435
You are.
You're here with him.

25:14.211 --> 25:17.009
Yeah. For the first time
in years, too.

25:18.582 --> 25:22.074
You know,
you bum around the world
and you lose contact

25:22.152 --> 25:24.143
and then you finally
show up to this.

25:24.221 --> 25:28.783
Man, I'm telling you,
it's like somebody's playing
some kind of lame trick on me.

25:30.427 --> 25:31.621
Or T.C.

25:32.796 --> 25:34.229
Yeah, T.C.

25:36.066 --> 25:39.502
I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be able
to deal with this.

25:39.569 --> 25:41.366
I mean, I don't know
how many more times

25:41.438 --> 25:43.463
I'm gonna be able
to talk to my mom
on the phone

25:43.540 --> 25:46.236
and listen
to all the questions
she has in her voice

25:46.309 --> 25:48.436
that she won't ask out loud.

25:48.645 --> 25:52.103
I just feel I've got
to be doing something.
Something more.

25:52.449 --> 25:54.007
Something real.

25:54.451 --> 25:56.544
Well, being here
with T.C. Is real.

25:58.788 --> 26:02.451
Talking to him. I mean,
maybe he can't see
or hear us but...

26:05.028 --> 26:08.361
You know, somehow,
I think he does.

26:09.366 --> 26:12.563
How? I just don't think
it's working.

26:15.539 --> 26:17.404
Well, I think it will.

26:19.943 --> 26:21.535
You're talking about God?

26:26.883 --> 26:30.341
Somehow or another,
I just feel that
I'm all prayed out.

26:35.425 --> 26:37.416
Well, I prayed, too.

26:38.929 --> 26:42.922
And I know it's not enough.
I know you've got to do more.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.400
I don't know about you,

26:45.468 --> 26:49.802
but I believe you got to pray
to God as if you couldn't
get anything done without Him,

26:50.040 --> 26:54.534
and then
you go about doing it
as if he doesn't exist.

26:55.245 --> 26:56.906
You mean,
take care of business.

26:57.380 --> 26:58.472
Yeah.

26:58.715 --> 27:01.275
But you see, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

27:01.351 --> 27:04.286
I mean,
we've been everywhere,
we've done everything.

27:04.354 --> 27:07.812
So I don't see what good
sitting and talking to T.C.
Is gonna do?

27:07.891 --> 27:10.223
I mean, I'm sorry,
I just don't.

27:10.794 --> 27:12.659
How do we get through?

27:12.729 --> 27:15.596
Maybe we don't,
but we gotta try.

27:21.271 --> 27:23.102
I get these feelings.

27:24.241 --> 27:25.674
I guess I...

27:25.909 --> 27:29.470
I call him my "little voice."
I know that sounds dumb,

27:31.548 --> 27:35.279
but it's like
an early warning system,
or a conscience.

27:37.220 --> 27:42.123
Or maybe, it's just a way
of communicating to myself

27:43.059 --> 27:46.790
how I really feel about
something deep down.

27:46.863 --> 27:50.196
And I think that
we all have
something like that.

27:50.767 --> 27:55.204
I think we communicate
those deep down feelings

27:55.472 --> 27:57.269
with others
that we care about.

27:57.340 --> 27:59.968
And it's not just
by talking about it.

28:02.345 --> 28:04.939
This isn't making
any sense, I'm sorry.

28:06.616 --> 28:07.913
I guess,

28:09.085 --> 28:10.746
what I mean is

28:11.154 --> 28:15.750
if there's a real connection
with somebody you care about,
ultimately they hear you.

28:15.825 --> 28:18.760
And that's why I think
T.C.'s gonna hear us.

28:20.964 --> 28:24.229
Well, I'll take
that "ultimately"
when it happens.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.563
But what about now?

28:28.004 --> 28:32.873
Well, I think
maybe we ought to take
another dive down there,

28:32.942 --> 28:34.569
before the police
dredge it up.

28:34.644 --> 28:36.134
Hey, I'm game.

28:36.713 --> 28:39.876
Well, maybe
we missed something.

28:40.350 --> 28:42.750
This your
"little voice" talking?

28:46.690 --> 28:49.420
No, just T.C.'s friend.
I'll see you at dawn.

28:54.197 --> 28:56.188
You know, we could
get arrested for this.

28:56.266 --> 28:58.996
Oh, you're not gonna
let that happen,
are you, Inspector?

28:59.069 --> 29:01.299
I mean, I still
don't know what we're
looking for down there.

29:01.371 --> 29:02.360
Me, either.

29:02.439 --> 29:06.170
Then how do you know whatever
you're looking for down there
is still down under there?

29:06.242 --> 29:08.608
Because whoever shot T.C.
Also shot Higgins.

29:08.678 --> 29:10.111
That means
the case is still hot.

29:10.180 --> 29:11.204
"Hot?"

29:11.281 --> 29:14.307
Yeah, like in "not cold,"
like in "keep an eye out
while we're down there."

29:14.384 --> 29:15.783
You ready?
Let's do it.

29:15.852 --> 29:17.843
All right, we'll start with
the perimeter wreckage first,

29:17.921 --> 29:20.355
examine everything
in the circle, then work
our way towards the center

29:20.423 --> 29:22.323
where the main sections
of the chopper are.

29:22.392 --> 29:24.451
Well, that could
take a couple dives.

29:24.527 --> 29:27.553
Yeah, but that's why
Inspector Bennett here

29:27.630 --> 29:29.291
is gonna buy us
all the time we need.

29:29.366 --> 29:31.732
Right?
Oh, sure, sure.

29:31.801 --> 29:34.269
And what if
you find nothing hot
down under there?

29:35.405 --> 29:38.636
<i>Rick's questions</i>
<i>were the same ones I had</i>
<i>already asked myself.</i>

29:38.708 --> 29:42.371
<i>And hot, cold</i>
<i>or lukewarm, I really</i>
<i>didn't have the answers.</i>

29:48.718 --> 29:52.347
<i>All I knew was the chopper</i>
<i>was the last place</i>
<i>to look for them.</i>

29:52.422 --> 29:55.721
<i>And the only place</i>
<i>we had after that</i>
<i>was the hospital room.</i>

29:55.792 --> 29:58.693
<i>And at last report,</i>
<i>T.C. Still wasn't talking.</i>

31:27.550 --> 31:30.576
<i>Cardiac arrest,</i>
<i>Room 6, code blue.</i>

31:55.712 --> 31:57.077
T.C.

32:01.050 --> 32:02.574
T.C.

32:31.714 --> 32:34.979
Naturally, I could never trust
Lieutenant Bancroft again,

32:35.051 --> 32:37.315
much less look
him in the face.

32:37.387 --> 32:41.881
Which reminds me of a similar
experience which occurred
in the Suez in '56.

32:42.025 --> 32:45.654
I was on camel patrol
with an officer newly
transferred to our unit,

32:45.728 --> 32:47.719
Captain Nigel Thornberry,

32:48.097 --> 32:51.726
who was quite anxious
to prove himself
to the rest of the lads.

32:51.801 --> 32:53.428
So, naturally,
when the Colonel asked,

32:53.503 --> 32:55.061
Thornberry was
the first to volunteer

32:55.138 --> 32:56.662
for the quite
dangerous job

32:56.739 --> 32:59.867
of tracking the entrenched
forces of the Egyptian
Third Division.

32:59.943 --> 33:03.709
And just as naturally,
the Colonel prevailed
upon me to accompany him,

33:03.780 --> 33:06.078
no doubt because
of my extensive experience

33:06.149 --> 33:08.208
with those
recalcitrant buggers.

33:08.284 --> 33:10.752
You know, the camels,
I mean.

33:10.820 --> 33:14.153
Now, quite unluckily,
as it happened,

33:14.223 --> 33:18.023
our guide was
a 12-year-old Bedouin lad
named Jamaal.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.893
This was his first
mission, too.

33:20.964 --> 33:24.400
However, he assured us
that he was quite familiar
with the terrain,

33:24.467 --> 33:27.732
and that his heart was
as big as the Siwa Oasis.

33:27.904 --> 33:30.168
Unfortunately, it was.

33:30.239 --> 33:34.039
For Jamaal and his camel
riding a couple of miles
ahead of us,

33:34.110 --> 33:37.568
were quickly captured
by a roving group
of desert bandits.

33:37.647 --> 33:40.207
We tracked them
for a full five days,

33:40.683 --> 33:44.084
and the cries of pain
and terror emanating from
the enemy campfire at night

33:44.153 --> 33:47.418
were enough to bring tears
to the eyes of the most
hardened warrior.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.617
Much less Captain Thornberry,

33:49.692 --> 33:52.559
who was reduced to a
state of abject helplessness,

33:52.629 --> 33:56.463
as he could only listen
as the fiends tortured
the resolutely brave lad who,

33:56.532 --> 33:59.296
nevertheless, refused
to reveal our position.

33:59.669 --> 34:01.500
Well, I knew
I had to act fast,

34:01.571 --> 34:03.300
I knew I had
to devise a plan.

34:03.373 --> 34:04.601
So...
Higgie baby...

34:04.674 --> 34:06.699
Late on the sixth night...

34:08.110 --> 34:09.873
Will you shut up?

34:12.649 --> 34:13.877
T.C.

34:14.817 --> 34:16.784
You're driving me crazy.

34:19.088 --> 34:20.817
I got to get some sleep.

34:20.889 --> 34:24.257
My God, man,
you've been asleep
for almost two days.

34:24.327 --> 34:25.692
No.

34:25.762 --> 34:28.322
I believe
the technical term
is "coma."

34:29.732 --> 34:30.926
Good night.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.092
T. C?

34:32.168 --> 34:33.498
T. C?
What?

34:33.603 --> 34:37.232
Don't go back to sleep.
I'm afraid you might lapse.
Please.

34:37.873 --> 34:40.866
What happened to you?
You been in a coma, too?

34:41.610 --> 34:44.136
Well, of course not.
I've been shot.

34:44.514 --> 34:45.674
Shot?

34:45.748 --> 34:49.650
Yes. While I was on Maui
attempting to "pull a tail,"
as Magnum would say.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.481
Of course, I prefer
to believe that my methods

34:51.554 --> 34:53.385
are somewhat more
sophisticated inasmuch as...

34:53.456 --> 34:56.391
Higgins, please,
just the essentials.

34:57.727 --> 34:59.558
I got a headache
you wouldn't believe.

34:59.629 --> 35:02.894
Try me. Nonetheless,
if you insist.

35:02.999 --> 35:06.867
Apparently I was shot
by the same knaves who shot
you out of the skies.

35:06.936 --> 35:08.130
Furthermore...

35:08.204 --> 35:09.728
Shot me?

35:09.806 --> 35:11.671
Yes.
You mean I...

35:11.774 --> 35:13.503
Yes. You were shot down.

35:13.576 --> 35:16.477
Right now, as we speak,
Magnum and Jerrold
are scuba diving

35:16.579 --> 35:18.672
amongst the wreckage
to try to determine...

35:18.748 --> 35:19.908
Jerrold?

35:19.982 --> 35:21.882
Yes, Jerrold Calvin,
your brother.

35:21.951 --> 35:24.112
He's been here
all the time.

35:24.687 --> 35:25.745
You sure?

35:25.822 --> 35:29.155
Well, of course I'm sure.
He's been of enormous help.

35:29.225 --> 35:30.715
My brother Jerrold?

35:30.793 --> 35:33.819
My God, man,
what's so remarkable
about that?

35:33.896 --> 35:35.124
Nothing.

35:35.531 --> 35:37.499
I got a lot of brothers.

35:38.968 --> 35:40.902
None of them
are named Jerrold.

35:40.970 --> 35:43.063
Now can I go back
to sleep?

35:50.729 --> 35:52.073
It's a miracle.

35:53.134 --> 35:54.746
I really didn't want
to say anything before

35:54.816 --> 35:57.307
without being
in full possession
of the facts,

35:57.419 --> 36:00.786
but in medical parlance,
I thought for sure
you were a goner.

36:03.658 --> 36:05.057
<i>Dr. Green, line 2...</i>

36:05.126 --> 36:07.458
And all you were doing
was talking to him?

36:07.595 --> 36:08.994
Yes, quite.

36:09.230 --> 36:10.857
But never mind
about that.

36:10.932 --> 36:14.129
What about this chap
who's been masquerading
as T.C.'s brother?

36:14.202 --> 36:15.999
How was he allowed in?

36:16.071 --> 36:18.835
He arrived at the hospital
a few minutes after
T.C.'s admittance,

36:18.907 --> 36:21.467
and I suppose
in the heat of trying
to save T.C.'s life,

36:21.543 --> 36:23.408
no one thought
to ask for an ID.

36:23.478 --> 36:26.072
He was really convincing,
you know, really helpful.

36:26.147 --> 36:29.173
He even offered to make
the call back to the family
on the mainland.

36:29.250 --> 36:32.777
If my family were
to find out about this,
they'd kill me.

36:34.189 --> 36:35.747
But they'd be here.

36:35.824 --> 36:37.121
Of course.

36:37.759 --> 36:41.820
The question remains, then,
who is this man
impersonating your brother?

36:41.896 --> 36:43.158
And why?

36:43.231 --> 36:47.190
I'm afraid the only person
who's going to be getting
any answers is Magnum.

38:01.843 --> 38:05.870
Come on. Come on, Thomas.
What in the hell are you
doing down there?

38:44.452 --> 38:48.855
A camera case.
An ordinary camera case.

38:48.923 --> 38:51.585
You know, the kind that
I use for aerial shots.

38:51.659 --> 38:53.354
What's so important
about that?

38:53.428 --> 38:56.625
I'll ask the questions.
And then he just vanished?

38:56.864 --> 38:57.888
Yes.

38:57.999 --> 39:00.763
He went into the hotel where
the honeymoon couple went.

39:00.835 --> 39:03.269
The honeymoon couple
who never checked in.

39:03.571 --> 39:05.471
Maybe because it was full.

39:05.540 --> 39:08.668
Yes of course, it was, because
of the scientific convention.

39:08.743 --> 39:10.233
But two people
planning a honeymoon

39:10.311 --> 39:12.211
would have known that
well in advance.

39:12.280 --> 39:15.511
Obviously, the Phillips'
hiring of you
was a well planned ruse

39:15.583 --> 39:19.280
to surreptitiously
introduce you
to Mr. Bates and his case.

39:19.854 --> 39:23.312
And the presence of Jerrold
here at this hospital
was a hastily planned one

39:23.391 --> 39:25.689
to find out from you
where that case was.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.955
But why on earth
would he think it
to be anywhere

39:28.029 --> 39:30.020
other than down
with your helicopter?

39:33.935 --> 39:34.924
Maybe...

39:35.003 --> 39:37.437
Maybe it was because
I stopped off on Molokai.

39:37.505 --> 39:40.406
I dropped off
some balls and gloves
for the boys' club there.

39:40.475 --> 39:44.377
Aha, so the <i>ersatz</i> Jerrold
was hedging his bets,

39:44.445 --> 39:46.743
splitting his time
between you and Magnum.

39:46.814 --> 39:49.248
The question is,
what is in that case

39:49.317 --> 39:51.785
for which people are
so cavalierly willing to kill?

39:51.853 --> 39:53.115
I don't know.

39:53.187 --> 39:56.452
Maybe one of those scientists
was trying to make
an atomic bomb or something

39:56.524 --> 39:58.389
to blow up the world.

39:59.093 --> 40:00.287
My God.

40:06.901 --> 40:08.562
What're you doing?

40:12.073 --> 40:15.008
Operator, get me
the Pali Loa Hotel
on Maui, please.

40:15.076 --> 40:17.442
What? What?
I was just joking.

40:17.512 --> 40:20.037
Will you connect me,
please? I'll wait.

40:20.114 --> 40:21.911
Higgins, man,
you can't be serious.

40:21.983 --> 40:23.780
I mean, I was just
making a dumb joke.

40:23.851 --> 40:27.218
Excuse me,
the scientific convention
you're currently conducting...

40:27.288 --> 40:29.051
Yes. What kind of...

40:30.692 --> 40:32.922
I see. Thank you.

40:37.432 --> 40:38.956
Get me the FBI.

40:40.001 --> 40:41.730
Nuclear physicists.

41:40.428 --> 41:43.363
Come on, come on.
You're running out of time.

41:50.872 --> 41:52.635
Rick! Rick!

41:53.107 --> 41:55.507
Help. Help me.

42:07.088 --> 42:10.216
Jerrold,
what's going on
down there?

42:15.363 --> 42:16.990
Jerrold! Jerrold!

42:17.365 --> 42:18.832
Rick. Rick.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.094
Thomas!

42:22.136 --> 42:23.899
Give me a hand.
Okay.

42:23.971 --> 42:25.529
What went on down there?

42:25.606 --> 42:27.335
I just saw Jerrold.

42:30.445 --> 42:31.878
Are you all right?

42:37.952 --> 42:39.510
Are you all right,
buddy?

42:39.587 --> 42:40.679
Yeah.

42:44.258 --> 42:46.590
What went on down there?
A shark?

42:47.361 --> 42:49.295
The only shark was him.

42:49.363 --> 42:51.331
Who? T.C.'s brother?

42:51.766 --> 42:54.257
Somehow I don't think
he was a relation.

42:54.335 --> 42:56.428
Hello, Inspector.

42:58.406 --> 42:59.873
Hi, guys.

42:59.941 --> 43:01.135
What's going on?

43:01.943 --> 43:03.103
That case.

43:03.177 --> 43:05.668
You wanna hand it over
and then we'll be on our way.

43:05.746 --> 43:10.012
Yeah? Well, maybe we'll
just take this case and put it
right back where we found it.

43:10.084 --> 43:12.518
You do,
and you're dead,
both of you.

43:12.587 --> 43:15.181
Oh, yeah?
Well, there's a cop sitting
right behind you on the dock.

43:15.256 --> 43:18.225
That's right,
and we put him to sleep.

43:18.926 --> 43:21.121
Now give us that damn case.

43:21.195 --> 43:23.595
What for?
What's in it?

43:23.698 --> 43:25.290
It's plutonium, man.

43:25.366 --> 43:26.628
Plutonium?

43:26.701 --> 43:28.225
Thomas, give it to him.

43:28.803 --> 43:29.827
No.

43:29.904 --> 43:32.065
Thomas, you heard what
the guy says is in the case!

43:32.139 --> 43:34.699
That's exactly why
they're not gonna get it.
- Thomas.

43:34.775 --> 43:38.040
Look at it this way, Rick.
Either way, we're history.

43:38.112 --> 43:40.512
Either they shoot us,
or...

43:41.749 --> 43:43.273
I can open up this case

43:43.351 --> 43:47.151
and we can all breathe enough
plutonium oxide to get
a real good glow in the dark.

43:47.221 --> 43:49.689
Wait a second.
No, you wait a second.

43:49.757 --> 43:51.156
Who are you?

43:51.726 --> 43:54.354
Since that rifle up there
is probably the same caliber
as the bullet

43:54.428 --> 43:56.453
that hit the control pod
of the chopper,

43:56.531 --> 43:58.328
you can tell me
why you shot it down.

43:58.399 --> 44:00.663
Shot it down?
They shot it down?

44:00.735 --> 44:02.327
Then why did
they pull T. C out?

44:02.403 --> 44:03.870
Because they were
after this case.

44:03.938 --> 44:06.372
But they couldn't
get it in time,
so they rescued T.C.

44:06.440 --> 44:07.907
So they could
get another chance.

44:07.975 --> 44:10.705
What for? Who are you?

44:10.778 --> 44:14.475
That doesn't matter,
but thanks for taking care
of that guy down there.

44:14.916 --> 44:16.474
Now, give me that case!

44:17.718 --> 44:20.915
Our buddy's
in a coma,
maybe dead.

44:21.722 --> 44:23.121
You're not walking away.

44:23.190 --> 44:25.385
<i>This is the United States</i>
<i>Coast Guard.</i>

44:25.459 --> 44:27.359
<i>Put down your weapons!</i>

44:29.130 --> 44:31.758
<i>You have 10 seconds</i>
<i>to surrender.</i>

44:34.335 --> 44:36.428
Do it!
They're not gonna shoot.

44:36.671 --> 44:37.695
Maybe.

44:37.772 --> 44:39.205
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

44:39.273 --> 44:41.104
But I'll open this case.

44:41.175 --> 44:42.267
Bull.

45:00.728 --> 45:04.061
Rick, this is T.C.'s case.

45:04.131 --> 45:05.598
The other one's
still down there.

45:06.968 --> 45:09.903
<i>Both Higgins and T.C.</i>
<i>Were on the road to recovery.</i>

45:09.971 --> 45:13.407
<i>And even though</i>
<i>Rick and I had a few days</i>
<i>of baby-sitting ahead of us,</i>

45:13.474 --> 45:14.998
<i>somehow we didn't mind.</i>

45:15.076 --> 45:18.102
<i>It's like Doc Ibold said,</i>
<i>a miracle that</i>
<i>they're both around.</i>

45:18.179 --> 45:20.807
<i>But Higgins</i>
<i>was easier to explain.</i>

45:20.881 --> 45:23.247
<i>Modern science got</i>
<i>that bullet out of his chest.</i>

45:23.317 --> 45:25.046
<i>T.C. Was a little different.</i>

45:25.119 --> 45:28.816
<i>He didn't wake up</i>
<i>until those who cared for him</i>
<i>somehow got through.</i>

45:28.889 --> 45:31.380
<i>Maybe that's when I should</i>
<i>have caught on to Jerrold.</i>

45:31.459 --> 45:34.553
<i>Then, come to think of it,</i>
<i>maybe that's when</i>
<i>my little voice did.</i>

45:34.962 --> 45:39.729
Now remember,
plenty of rest and no,
I repeat, no excitement.

45:39.967 --> 45:44.131
No aggravation
of any kind
for either of you.

45:44.805 --> 45:46.466
I'll be by to see you
in a couple of days.

45:46.540 --> 45:48.030
<i>Doctor Ibold to OR 6.</i>
Thanks, Doc.

45:48.109 --> 45:50.669
Yes, quite. Thank you.
<i>Doctor Ibold to OR 6.</i>

45:50.745 --> 45:53.179
Take care of them.
And <i>remember...</i>
No excitement.

45:53.247 --> 45:54.771
No aggravation.

45:55.082 --> 45:56.879
All right.
I'll see you later.

45:56.951 --> 45:58.248
I got a gallbladder
to take care of.

45:58.319 --> 45:59.718
Thanks, Doc.
See you, Doc.

45:59.787 --> 46:01.186
How you guys doing?

46:01.255 --> 46:02.415
Fine.

46:03.024 --> 46:06.551
What I wanna know is,
how did that creep know
so much about my family?

46:06.627 --> 46:09.187
Well, it's obvious T.C.,
the guys Jerrold was
working for

46:09.263 --> 46:11.288
were counting on you
to deliver the plutonium.

46:11.365 --> 46:13.299
After all,
since they knew
that they were

46:13.367 --> 46:15.835
being monitored
by their opposition,

46:15.936 --> 46:18.734
as represented
by Leo and Carl...

46:18.806 --> 46:21.639
Excuse me.
...the fake fishermen.
So, they couldn't...

46:21.709 --> 46:24.337
Excuse me.
...entrust it to
commercial travel.

46:24.412 --> 46:27.381
So, when they
picked you out
to be the courier,

46:27.448 --> 46:28.710
they did
a little research.

46:28.783 --> 46:31.946
All it probably took
was a telephone call
to your family by Jerrold

46:32.019 --> 46:34.647
posing as a representative
of their insurance company.

46:34.722 --> 46:36.587
He asked a couple questions.
It's very simple.

46:36.657 --> 46:38.090
And fiendishly clever.

46:38.159 --> 46:39.751
Yeah, that, too.

46:39.827 --> 46:42.352
He also made a telephone call
to Maui that got you shot.

46:42.430 --> 46:43.658
Yeah, but what
I wanna know is,

46:43.731 --> 46:45.096
How did you know
underwater

46:45.166 --> 46:47.430
that the camera case
contained plutonium?
- Oh, my God! Hurry.

46:47.501 --> 46:50.766
Well, I didn't, Rick,
but see, I figured

46:50.838 --> 46:54.330
that if they were desperate
enough to, number one,
shoot T.C. Down,

46:54.408 --> 46:55.636
and number two,
shoot Higgins,

46:55.710 --> 46:57.940
and number three,
have somebody pose
as T.C.'s brother,

46:58.012 --> 46:59.343
and then try
and kill me,

46:59.413 --> 47:01.745
that it had to be something
connected with the chopper.

47:01.816 --> 47:03.306
Please, clear this area!
Out of the way!
- Excuse me.

47:03.384 --> 47:05.978
So, when I
finally found
the camera case

47:06.053 --> 47:08.920
I just decided that
it would be safer
if I went back

47:08.989 --> 47:10.115
and brought up
T.C.'s case

47:10.191 --> 47:12.887
Just in case there were any
of those yo-yos still around

47:12.960 --> 47:14.484
and I was right,
they were.

47:14.562 --> 47:18.191
Besides, the one
with the plutonium in it
was just too darn heavy.

47:19.333 --> 47:21.358
I'll go around
and get the van.

47:21.435 --> 47:23.665
Great.
We'll wait here.

47:24.205 --> 47:26.799
Do you think we should
take the freeway
or the Old Beach Road?

47:26.874 --> 47:30.002
Oh, we better take
the Beach Road. I don't
wanna take any chances.

47:30.077 --> 47:32.204
That freeway can get pretty
crazy at this time of day,

47:32.279 --> 47:33.803
and you know
what Doc Ibold said.

47:33.881 --> 47:35.610
No excitement.
Right.

47:35.683 --> 47:37.241
...you can hit the ladder,
you hit the ladder!

47:42.323 --> 47:45.315
Oh, my God!
