00:08.460 --> 00:10.460
Can't we just go out for milkshakes?

00:10.500 --> 00:12.530
I mean, we don't even have a blender.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.500
We don't need to waste money on a blender.

00:14.530 --> 00:16.630
Let me show you something.
Watch this. Come here.

00:16.660 --> 00:18.570
Put that in your mouth.
There you go.

00:20.350 --> 00:22.550
Put a little bit
right there. Yeah, yeah.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.660
That's it.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.430
Yup.

00:26.470 --> 00:29.470
Close that a little bit. Now shake it,
shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.740
Okay, all right.
There you go.

00:31.770 --> 00:34.710
What's that for?
You thought I was making it for you?

00:37.820 --> 00:39.780
Hey, dad, I can tell you're
busy, so I'll make this quick.

00:39.820 --> 00:42.520
Can I watch <i>High Heels High</i>
<i>tonight? Thank you!</i>

00:42.550 --> 00:45.620
You know the rules, chyna.
No TV on school nights.

00:45.660 --> 00:49.490
Come on, dad. Everybody in school
watches <i>high heels hig</i> please?

00:49.530 --> 00:52.790
Just one episode, then I'll
study for my science test.

00:52.830 --> 00:55.500
Fine. But if it
affects your grades,

00:55.530 --> 00:58.730
You won't be watching
any TV until you're 40.

00:58.770 --> 01:02.540
By the time I'm 40, I'll have my
own kids to threaten and deprive.

01:04.379 --> 01:07.410
Wait a minute, now.
I treat you kids with dignity and respect.

01:07.450 --> 01:09.480
Now, okay, kids, open up your armpits.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.590
It's time to defrost these lamb chops.
Come on.

01:12.620 --> 01:13.620
Come on. Below there.

02:16.660 --> 02:19.600
Once Tatiana's chemistry assignment

02:19.630 --> 02:23.600
"accidentally" explodes in her "face,"

02:23.640 --> 02:25.670
She'll be "tragically" disfigured.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.640
And the <i>le chic</i> makeup

02:30.380 --> 02:33.820
Wow, Justine's a horrible person.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.650
I love her!

02:41.490 --> 02:44.730
Tatiana!
You're "back."

02:44.760 --> 02:48.400
They gave you a new face, and...

02:50.830 --> 02:52.770
It's "mine"!

03:00.510 --> 03:02.510
What a season finale!

03:02.550 --> 03:06.580
I thought Justine
now she's literally two-faced!

03:06.620 --> 03:09.620
Good morning, chyna.

03:09.650 --> 03:12.620
Morning?
How can it be morning?

03:13.690 --> 03:15.690
Hey, you're up early.

03:15.730 --> 03:18.660
Oh, yeah, I've been up for "hours"

03:18.700 --> 03:21.570
"studying" for my
science "test."

03:21.600 --> 03:24.470
What are you "doing"?

03:24.500 --> 03:28.370
I don't "know."

03:28.410 --> 03:29.810
Hey, are those the same
clothes you had on yesterday?

03:30.640 --> 03:32.380
Yeah!

03:32.410 --> 03:35.380
It's "wear the same clothes

03:35.410 --> 03:37.580
"as you did yesterday day" at school.

03:37.620 --> 03:39.620
We have lots of crazy, fun events.

03:39.650 --> 03:42.520
Like yesterday was

03:42.560 --> 03:48.490
"wear the same clothes
that you're gonna wear tomorrow" day.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.560
See, that's the best thing
I like about my job.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.500
Same outfit every day.
Yeah.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.770
I never even wash this thing.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.800
Well, good luck on your test.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.540
Although the way you've been
studying, I doubt you'll need it.

04:04.510 --> 04:05.510
I'm "dead."

04:09.750 --> 04:11.650
Did you find my sunglasses yet?

04:16.390 --> 04:17.760
No.

04:17.790 --> 04:21.529
And I really wish it wasn't
frog dissection day.

04:25.570 --> 04:28.770
Oh, look.
Here are my sunglasses!

04:41.480 --> 04:42.710
You dropped your cell phone.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.780
That's not mine.

04:43.820 --> 04:45.750
Mine has rhinestones on it.

04:47.650 --> 04:51.560
I mean, rhinestones made of diamonds.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.670
It's principal Skidmore's phone.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.330
She must have accidentally
dropped it in the trash.

05:01.370 --> 05:03.800
When she was throwing something away.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.640
Probably these gnarly toenail clippings.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.710
We should go return her phone.

05:10.740 --> 05:14.280
No way! Think of
the possibilities.

05:14.310 --> 05:17.320
We can send texts and emails
to teachers from Skidmore.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.290
And get them to do whatever we want.

05:20.320 --> 05:25.320
Wow. For the first time you're
actually making some sense.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.290
Thank goodness.

05:27.330 --> 05:28.730
Because I was starting to think
my mind was getting cloudy.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.630
From breathing in all those
frog guts and formaldehyde.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.630
Oh look, a puppy.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.570
Who's a good puppy?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.440
You're a good puppy!

05:39.470 --> 05:40.640
Yeah!

05:46.550 --> 05:48.350
Excuse me, sir.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.520
Actually, bonita is a female.

05:53.550 --> 05:55.490
Not now, Fletcher.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.390
I'm totally going to fail this test.

05:57.420 --> 06:00.360
I committed the whole textbook to memory.

06:01.690 --> 06:04.600
Quick! Tell me everything

06:04.630 --> 06:07.360

And I'm toast.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.360

06:37.400 --> 06:39.800
You do not want me to raise my voice!

06:43.740 --> 06:48.640
Okay, I just sent a text using Skidmore's
phone to our trigonometry teacher,

06:48.680 --> 06:50.540
Forbidding her from giving us homework.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.510
Nice!

06:52.550 --> 06:55.720
Almost as good as me giving the entire
foreign language department the week off.

06:58.490 --> 06:59.520
<i>Adios.</i>

06:59.550 --> 07:00.820
<i>Bon voyage.</i>

07:03.630 --> 07:07.360
There's Skidmore.
Put the phone away!

07:07.400 --> 07:12.370
Kids, I need for you to let me know
when you see my cellular phone.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.710
I am offering a $50 reward.

07:20.380 --> 07:22.540
Maybe we should turn in
the phone for the reward.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.610
$50 is a lot of money.

07:24.650 --> 07:28.580
I mean, I could buy two bottles
of end-of-summer bronzer.

07:28.620 --> 07:32.520
What? You never
say yes to a first offer.

07:32.550 --> 07:36.590
If we play our cards right,
we can get her up to $100.

07:36.620 --> 07:40.760
You're right. And then I could
buy four bottles of bronzer.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.740
Chyna, watch where you're going!

07:52.780 --> 07:55.580
Just because bonita does not
have a nervous system,

07:55.610 --> 07:59.610
Does not mean she does not have feelings!

07:59.650 --> 08:02.780
Sorry. I was just watching <i>high heels
high</i> <i>for the last time.</i>

08:02.820 --> 08:05.320
Because once my dad
finds out I failed my test,

08:05.350 --> 08:08.460
I won't be allowed to watch
tv until I look like bonita.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.330
Sorry I'm late!

08:11.360 --> 08:14.400
My daughter would not go down for her nap,

08:14.430 --> 08:17.630
No matter how many lullabies I sang her.

08:17.670 --> 08:19.770
Anyway, I graded your tests.

08:22.340 --> 08:24.370
Alright, 67!

08:24.410 --> 08:25.440
You got a d?

08:25.470 --> 08:29.540
No. It's my 67th
consecutive a.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.450
I got an a, too!

08:32.480 --> 08:35.480
Well, at least you guys got good
grades, because I'm about to get...

08:36.590 --> 08:38.549
An a?

08:40.559 --> 08:42.289
How can that be?

08:43.630 --> 08:45.430
Hello.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.600
All right, I'll try it again.

Psst. Cameron.
We need to talk.

09:08.490 --> 09:11.190
Lexi, no one knows we have the phone.

09:11.230 --> 09:13.360
You don't have to hide and whisper.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.130
I know. I just don't want to
be seen socializing with you.

09:18.270 --> 09:21.540
It's been three days and Skidmore
hasn't raised the reward.

09:21.570 --> 09:24.140
I think we should take the $50.

09:24.170 --> 09:28.480
Relax. This is all part
of the game. She'll crack.

09:31.580 --> 09:35.550
See? Skidmore's office line.
I'll make our demands.

09:35.580 --> 09:38.450
Wait! You need to
disguise your voice.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.390
I've been waiting for your call.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.360
When I catch whoever this is,

09:49.400 --> 09:52.570
You will be in serious trouble!

09:54.140 --> 09:56.570
Give us $200,

09:56.610 --> 10:00.540
Or we delete one app per hour.

10:00.580 --> 10:02.580
Please don't touch
<i>mad birdies!</i>

10:02.610 --> 10:06.380

10:06.420 --> 10:10.220
Listen to me.
Here is what you need to do.

10:11.460 --> 10:14.560
Just bounce the pigeon off the barn.

10:19.530 --> 10:21.230
Oh! Hey, check it out.

10:21.270 --> 10:23.600
Chyna and I are making a blimp
for our science fair project,

10:23.630 --> 10:26.370
And this is the perfect material.

10:27.540 --> 10:30.540
Are you cutting up a wedding dress?

10:30.570 --> 10:33.380
Yeah. I found it
in my mom's closet.

10:33.410 --> 10:38.250
In a box marked
"save for olive's big day."

10:38.280 --> 10:42.220
And I figured, what day is
bigger than the science fair?

10:43.550 --> 10:46.620
By the way, where is chyna?
She's supposed to be helping me with this.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.290
How would I know?

10:49.330 --> 10:51.460
It's not like I sewed a GPS transmitter.

10:51.500 --> 10:55.200
Into the lining of her backpack
so I could track her every move.

10:56.270 --> 10:58.200
Sorry I asked.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.440
Although, if I had to guess,

11:00.470 --> 11:04.510
She'll probably be here
in three, two, one...

11:04.540 --> 11:05.510
Guys!

11:08.180 --> 11:10.380
I tried to complain to Mr.
Marceau about giving me an a,

11:10.420 --> 11:12.320
But he just acted really weird.

11:12.350 --> 11:14.350
Even weirder than usual.

11:16.290 --> 11:18.390
Something is going on here.

11:18.430 --> 11:21.490
Olive, do you speak Japanese?

11:27.300 --> 11:30.370
Stop mumbling and just answer my question.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.370
I'm trying to recruit
a swimming champion from Japan.

11:34.410 --> 11:37.470
For the a.N.T. Program.
I need someone to translate.

11:37.510 --> 11:39.340
I stopped by the language department,

11:39.380 --> 11:43.480
But for some reason none of
the teachers were there.

11:43.520 --> 11:46.620
How is he gonna get through high
school if he can't speak English?

11:46.650 --> 11:53.420
Don't worry.
I have my ways.

11:53.460 --> 11:58.230
I will do anything to keep
this kid eligible to compete.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.330
He swims faster than an eel.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.470
Well, actually, sailfish are the fastest...

12:02.500 --> 12:03.630
Don't care.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.540
I knew we were getting special treatment.

12:07.570 --> 12:12.240
Skidmore obviously has some sort of secret
scheme to make sure the ants get straight A's.

12:12.280 --> 12:17.150
So we're allowed to compete in
things like swim meets, art shows,

12:18.180 --> 12:20.150
And whatever olive's good for.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.550
Skidmore does love her trophies.

12:23.590 --> 12:26.590
I hear she's working on
legally adopting all of them.

12:27.630 --> 12:29.290
Hello, boys.

12:31.230 --> 12:34.170
Mama's gonna bring you a new friend soon.

12:35.530 --> 12:38.240
He looks like this.

12:41.540 --> 12:43.510
We have got to do something about this.

12:43.540 --> 12:47.580
No, what we need to do is start
working on our science fair project.

12:47.610 --> 12:50.410
That's it!
We'll expose the conspiracy.

12:50.450 --> 12:52.550
By doing the worst science project ever!

12:52.580 --> 12:55.220
What?

12:55.250 --> 12:58.390
When Mr. Marceau gives us
an a on our pathetic project,

12:58.420 --> 13:02.490
All the older students will be
furious and demand he give us an f!

13:09.470 --> 13:12.540
No idea what you just said,

13:12.570 --> 13:16.410
But I'm guessing it wasn't
"I support your plan 100%."

13:23.460 --> 13:24.560
Have you lost your mind?

13:24.600 --> 13:27.630
We are not doing
a bad science fair project.

13:27.670 --> 13:31.370
That is the worst idea since someone
decided to place innocent grade schoolers.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.710
In the Demon's Belly that is High School!

13:34.740 --> 13:38.640
I'm sorry, but it's not fair for the
ants to get A's we don't deserve.

13:38.680 --> 13:41.580
And I intend to blow the lid
off this whole thing!

13:41.610 --> 13:44.450
No! Why would you want to
blow the lid off anything?

13:44.480 --> 13:47.720
The world needs lids.

13:47.750 --> 13:54.360
Without lids, things would be boiling over and splattering.
And how would you make rice?

13:54.390 --> 13:57.600
In a microwave.
Well, you can, but it's not as moist.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.600
Okay, let's say we do your
project and we get an f.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.570
Your dad will forbid you from watching tv.

14:05.610 --> 14:08.480
And you'll never see another
episode of <i>High Heels High.</i>

14:08.510 --> 14:09.740
She's right.

14:11.710 --> 14:13.550
Okay, fine.

14:15.050 --> 14:16.980
We'll do a great science fair project.

14:17.020 --> 14:20.020
I need to know what Tatiana
does with Justine's face.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.460
Officer parks, I want to thank
you for doing me this favor.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.260
Oh, my pleasure. Now I'm going to
need you to identify the remains.

14:30.300 --> 14:34.170
But I have to warn you, what you're
about to see is pretty gruesome.

14:35.300 --> 14:39.210
Oh, thank goodness.
It isn't mine.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.450
What are you doing here?

14:48.480 --> 14:51.220
I live here.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.420
Wait, are you Cameron's father?

14:53.460 --> 14:56.390
Because I heard his dad was a mall cop.

14:56.430 --> 14:57.430
Come on.

14:59.460 --> 15:02.300
So... Is Cameron home?

15:02.330 --> 15:06.000
Yeah. One sec.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.200
Cameron! There's a girl here
who says she knows you!

15:08.240 --> 15:12.140
I mean, seriously, she said
it out loud and everything!

15:14.310 --> 15:16.350
Hey, Lexi.

15:16.380 --> 15:20.380
Well, I'll leave you two alone.
I don't want to intrude.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.450
Honey, get the camera!
Cameron's got a girl over!

15:26.490 --> 15:28.990
We've got big problems.
Big problems!

15:29.030 --> 15:31.400
Skidmore called the cops
and the cops are your dad!

15:31.430 --> 15:33.300
I should have known he wasn't a mall cop!

15:33.330 --> 15:37.130
I mean, I've been to the mall many,
many times, and I've never seen him!

15:39.100 --> 15:42.270
My dad is on
the case? Relax.

15:42.310 --> 15:47.140
When we played hide and seek
as kids, he never found us.

15:47.180 --> 15:51.450
Though, now that I think about it,
I'm not really sure he was looking.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.280
I'm done. This is over.
We are getting rid of this phone.

15:57.320 --> 16:01.250
Tomorrow we'll stage a reenactment
and pretend to find the phone.

16:01.290 --> 16:04.090
This time in front of Skidmore.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.260
Fine! But this was
a horrible mistake.

16:06.290 --> 16:09.260
After tomorrow, I'm going to
pretend I never knew you.

16:13.030 --> 16:15.270
Now, that makes more sense.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.010
What's going on?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.100
Hey, Justine.

16:45.130 --> 16:49.140
I hear you disfigured
a girl in a chemical fire.

16:49.170 --> 16:53.270
That's nothing compared to the
evil, sinister thing I did.

16:53.310 --> 16:56.110
I'm getting straight A's.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.040
That I don't deserve.

16:59.450 --> 17:03.380
"what?" I'm the baddest
bad girl in school.

17:03.420 --> 17:07.420
You were.
But now I'm badderer.

17:11.390 --> 17:13.130
I am evil.

17:15.270 --> 17:17.470
I do look good in heels.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.339
But I'm evil.

17:23.010 --> 17:26.440
I have to do what's right and fail science.

17:37.220 --> 17:40.120
This is some high-quality
poster board.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.270
High-tension
power lines!

17:47.300 --> 17:50.440
High tension is something I know about,

17:50.470 --> 17:55.340
Since my wife just had our baby
and my mother-in-law moved in.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.310
Now I never get any peace and quiet.

18:04.150 --> 18:08.180
I'm here! And I brought
our new science project!

18:10.290 --> 18:12.190
"why donuts are good for you?"

18:13.190 --> 18:15.160
That's not sound science!

18:15.190 --> 18:17.260
I wish it was, but it's not!

18:18.360 --> 18:21.070
Sorry, olive.
I can't keep living a lie.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.170
I have to do the right thing,

18:23.200 --> 18:26.300
Even if it means losing TV privileges.

18:26.340 --> 18:32.210
Look, we're doing our project
on the miracle of zeppelins!

18:32.240 --> 18:35.080
No, we're doing it on donuts.

18:35.110 --> 18:37.020
- Zeppelins.
- Donuts.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.350
- Zeppelins.
- Donuts.

18:38.390 --> 18:40.050
- Zeppelins.
- Donuts.

18:40.090 --> 18:41.190
- Zeppelins.
- Donuts.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.420
- Zeppelins.
- Donuts.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.090
- Zeppelins.
- Donuts.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.060
Oh, the humanity!

18:54.200 --> 18:56.470
Whoa, the helium did that?

18:56.500 --> 18:59.170
No. The mylar
shorted out the wires.

18:59.210 --> 19:02.070
The helium just dissipated
into the nearby air.

19:04.510 --> 19:08.210
So what's our grade?
I'm guessing an a?

19:08.250 --> 19:12.120
An a? You nearly
blew my head off!

19:14.120 --> 19:16.050
A-minus?

19:16.090 --> 19:18.050
You both get F's!

19:21.120 --> 19:25.030
Oh, thank goodness my voice
went back to normal!

19:25.060 --> 19:28.400
That other one was so annoying!

19:31.040 --> 19:32.240
I don't understand.

19:32.270 --> 19:35.410
You're supposed to give us
ants A's no matter what.

19:35.440 --> 19:39.340
Just like you did on my science test
that I obviously should have failed.

19:39.380 --> 19:43.980
All right, I'm gonna let you
two in on a little secret.

19:44.020 --> 19:47.390
I gave everybody A's
because I was too tired.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.320
To grade all those papers.

19:49.350 --> 19:53.420
I don't know why, but my baby never sleeps!

20:00.100 --> 20:01.130
Oops.

20:03.030 --> 20:06.200
So, you have any other
theories you want to prove?

20:07.140 --> 20:09.070
Yes, as a matter of fact.

20:11.510 --> 20:14.470
Can donuts be used
to patch up a friendship?

20:17.980 --> 20:21.020
Look, "o" for "olive."

20:24.000 --> 20:25.920
Hey! Get it!

20:33.330 --> 20:34.660
Oh, no.
There's Skidmore.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.300
Ugh. More toenail clippings?

20:39.330 --> 20:43.500
Look at those claws.
What is she, part falcon?

20:44.270 --> 20:45.440
Everyone freeze!

20:47.300 --> 20:49.270
I've solved a serious crime.

20:49.310 --> 20:52.270
And the guilty party is
standing right in front of me.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.680
Okay, I don't know what that was about,

20:57.710 --> 20:59.610
But I know who took your phone.

20:59.650 --> 21:01.480
Really?
Yes.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.350
I've been doing
a little "research."

21:04.390 --> 21:08.360
Why am I doing this now?
I actually did do some research.

21:08.390 --> 21:11.630
And it turns out that you signed
up for the replacement plan,

21:11.660 --> 21:14.430
Which can only mean one thing.

21:14.460 --> 21:17.270
You stole your own phone so you
can get a better one for free.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.230
Oh, that's preposterous!

21:19.270 --> 21:21.200
Hmm. We'll see about that.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.470
We'll call your phone and I bet it
rings right there in your purse.

21:30.380 --> 21:31.480
Hello?

21:32.280 --> 21:34.320
Cameron?

21:34.350 --> 21:37.720
Dad, I can't talk right now.
We're about to find out who took Skidmore's phone.

21:42.490 --> 21:44.460
Oh...

21:44.500 --> 21:46.660
Cameron, shame on you!

21:46.700 --> 21:51.640
Stealing a phone from a helpless old lady!

21:51.670 --> 21:54.540
What? You're just
as guilty as I am!

21:54.570 --> 21:59.310
How dare you accuse me of something
so vile and unforgivable!

21:59.350 --> 22:02.250
Lexi, if you're so innocent,

22:02.280 --> 22:05.450
How do you explain all these
pictures of you all over the school?

22:07.250 --> 22:09.220
Cameron!

22:09.250 --> 22:11.660
What? I just wanted
our time together.

22:11.690 --> 22:14.260
Let's go!

22:14.290 --> 22:17.260
And Lexi, I will deal with you later.

22:19.230 --> 22:23.230
Wow, I didn't think about
the replacement plan. Hmm.

22:23.430 --> 22:24.630
