WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:08.273
[Pomp and Circumstance" playing]

00:08.341 --> 00:11.543
As you ladies go out
and conquer the world,

00:11.611 --> 00:14.880
remember the words of our
dear Eleanor, you gained

00:14.948 --> 00:18.917
strength, courage,
confidence, by every

00:18.985 --> 00:21.820
experience in which
you really stop-

00:21.888 --> 00:25.491
to look fear in the face,
you must do the thing you

00:25.558 --> 00:27.226
think you cannot do.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.462
Congratulations class of 2014.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.344
Hey.

00:46.446 --> 00:47.613
Congratulations, baby.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.749
Dani, I can't
believe you wore those.

00:50.817 --> 00:54.586
Oh Mom, after four years
of the same uniform, these

00:54.654 --> 00:57.056
shoes are my declaration
of independence.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.504
Tyree quit playin'!

01:12.872 --> 01:14.152
Well, congratulations, baby cuz.

01:14.641 --> 01:15.974
So what's the 911?

01:16.042 --> 01:17.276
We can't be late for my party.

01:20.547 --> 01:21.787
We all chipped in for the best.

01:26.719 --> 01:27.719
What?

01:28.621 --> 01:29.788
Woo!

02:37.991 --> 02:38.991
Ahh!

02:47.667 --> 02:49.501
Oh!

02:54.941 --> 02:55.941
Look at you cheesin'.

02:56.709 --> 02:57.709
Whatever man.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.779
I cannot wait to play
with the line in college.

03:01.614 --> 03:02.714
Still can't believe your
parents are cool with you

03:02.782 --> 03:04.082
going to ANT.

03:04.617 --> 03:06.084
I mean, don't they need
you going somewhere like

03:06.152 --> 03:09.087
Harvard, Brown or Spelman
for dinner party

03:09.155 --> 03:10.155
cool points?

03:11.157 --> 03:12.224
What?

03:12.292 --> 03:13.592
I mean, c'mon D you know
they're all about public

03:13.660 --> 03:14.359
image.

03:14.427 --> 03:15.694
It's not true Ty.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.431
A blank image in the house.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.433
Happy graduation, baby.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.735
Oh my god, this is so fly!

03:24.137 --> 03:25.671
And you gonna look even
flier when you driving

03:25.738 --> 03:27.739
this right on Spelman's campus.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.477
Is this car supposed to
make me change my mind?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.725
There is no such thing
as a drum line in the real

03:46.793 --> 03:48.160
world, Danielle.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.662
You have to start
preparing for your future.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.598
We'll handle everything.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.666
I got a doctor colleague
of mine, he's going to

03:54.734 --> 03:55.854
let you shadow him at Emory.

03:56.603 --> 03:58.737
You guys have no faith in
me, no faith that I can

03:58.805 --> 04:01.139
make a decision on my own,
even if it's about my own

04:01.207 --> 04:02.307
life.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.842
As long as we are funding
that life, we will help

04:03.910 --> 04:06.111
you make those right decisions.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.748
Then I'll except the
partial scholarship they

04:09.816 --> 04:12.618
offered me, and I'll get
a job to cover my extra

04:12.685 --> 04:15.821
expenses but, I am going to ANT.

04:16.322 --> 04:19.658
You will not get a-No,
no, she thinks she can do

04:19.726 --> 04:22.160
it, do it.

04:24.230 --> 04:26.190
I need to take control of
my life without you guys

04:26.199 --> 04:27.699
planning everything for me.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.021
I'm stronger than you think.

04:32.739 --> 04:33.739
Danielle-

04:36.709 --> 04:37.809
It's official, this year's

04:37.877 --> 04:40.646
On the Jamboree
Classic Battle of the Bands

04:40.713 --> 04:43.582
is gonna be hosting
on ANT's campus.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.451
Now the Panthers haven't
won a classic in years,

04:46.519 --> 04:48.220
but they're trying to
turn it around with

04:48.288 --> 04:49.288
a new director.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.157
Atlanta native and
ANT alum Sean Taylor.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.926
Back in the day Sean and
future superstar Devon

04:54.994 --> 04:56.762
Miles were unstoppable.

04:56.829 --> 04:59.998
Yes, he's the Panther's
great black hope, welcome

05:00.066 --> 05:01.833
home Sean, leggo.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.714
Man, I can't believe you
guys round up here in my

05:15.782 --> 05:17.783
momma's old car, when we
could've been stunting in

05:17.850 --> 05:19.151
that new ride.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.653
I have to prove that I can
do this on my own, which

05:21.721 --> 05:23.522
means no extras from my parents.

05:26.926 --> 05:29.695
Hey Tyree, can you
help us with our bags?

05:30.863 --> 05:32.831
Oh, let me get with y'all
in a minute, let me just

05:32.899 --> 05:34.179
get my cousin
settled real quick.

05:36.636 --> 05:40.572
That drum solo you posted
on YouTube, it was hot.

05:46.713 --> 05:47.846
D, I told you.

05:48.948 --> 05:51.616
Woo, I get much respect
for being section leader.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.052
This is our year to take
back the championship.

05:55.221 --> 05:56.788
Woo hoo, you know, if you
get the orientation and

05:56.856 --> 06:00.025
make the line, you
gonna have to bat out too.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.661
Okay, not only will I make
the line, but I will be-

06:02.729 --> 06:05.063
- the first female
section leader.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.132
I know, cuz. Just
slow down, all right?

06:09.001 --> 06:10.001
All right.

06:10.069 --> 06:11.069
All right.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.675
Dani Raymond, right?

06:16.743 --> 06:17.609
Yeah.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.244
I looked you up on
Facebook, I'm your

06:19.312 --> 06:21.246
new roomie, Tasha!

06:21.314 --> 06:23.315
I know, I tried to
look you up too.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.650
I deleted that account,
college is all about

06:25.718 --> 06:27.819
reinvention, all you
need to know is that I'm

06:27.887 --> 06:30.655
country, I'm clean, and I
don't plan to kill you in

06:30.723 --> 06:32.124
your sleep.

06:35.995 --> 06:36.862
C'mon, I like the new outfit.

06:36.929 --> 06:37.829
Thank you, girl.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.897
Ripped jean situation.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.004
A lot has changed around
here since we were on this

06:46.072 --> 06:47.172
field together, Sean.

06:49.275 --> 06:54.079
Well Nia, oh, I'm sorry,
Dean Phillips, it's gonna

06:54.147 --> 06:55.380
take some getting used to.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.516
And you think
Dr. Taylor won't?

06:58.117 --> 06:59.117
Welcome home.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.452
What it is, I have
you to thank for that.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.189
Me and the recession, a
lot of black colleges need

07:04.257 --> 07:06.958
money, and both of us
know, a good band puts

07:07.026 --> 07:09.027
butts in the seats, and
butts in the seats puts

07:09.095 --> 07:11.129
money back in the schools,
so that's why I told the

07:11.197 --> 07:13.064
board to do whatever it
took to steal you from

07:13.132 --> 07:14.132
GRD.

07:15.001 --> 07:15.901
You know I was only the
assistant band director

07:15.968 --> 07:16.968
there.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.157
Well, I guess you
better bring it then.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.208
I was hoping we could get
past what happened between

07:23.276 --> 07:25.010
me and you.

07:25.912 --> 07:29.281
You mean what happened
between you and me and

07:29.348 --> 07:30.348
my brother?

07:30.583 --> 07:31.583
We never talked about it.

07:32.151 --> 07:35.854
That was a long time
ago... it's a new day.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.024
I hope so.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.836
Welcome to band
dorm orientation.

07:50.903 --> 07:52.938
I'm Bulldog, drum major.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.307
For the next three weeks,
I'm your momma and your

07:55.374 --> 07:56.374
daddy.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.744
McKinley hall is co-ed,
now that may sound like

07:59.812 --> 08:01.532
you can go buck wild,
but I don't play that.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.350
Ladies, keep your
music boxes closed.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.386
Fellas, keep your
instruments in their

08:08.454 --> 08:10.255
cases, 'cause I don't play that.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.257
He's preaching like my
pops on Sunday morning.

08:14.026 --> 08:18.864
Oh, ahh, Dani, Leon,
sixes, Leon this is Dani,

08:18.931 --> 08:19.931
my roomie.

08:20.132 --> 08:21.132
Whats up?

08:21.300 --> 08:23.068
So, did we miss something?

08:24.103 --> 08:25.871
Bullet points, no hooking up.

08:26.472 --> 08:27.772
But that's my major.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.241
I know.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.988
First party rule of the
south, shake your ass like

08:43.054 --> 08:44.489
you got rent to pay.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.958
From where I stand, it
is a beautiful thing.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.408
Oh, I like a little
junk in the trunk.

08:52.398 --> 08:55.300
Oh, no JFK didn't.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.738
Hey look around, all this
fresh meat just waiting to

08:59.805 --> 09:00.805
be tenderized.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.041
Oh, yo, I'd rather feel
shorty over there lookin'

09:03.109 --> 09:04.442
like she need some home already.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.278
Uhh, I got dibs.

09:07.246 --> 09:08.947
No, no, no that ain't
dibs, that's family,

09:09.015 --> 09:11.449
that's my cousin Dani,
she's off limits bro.

09:12.952 --> 09:13.952
My bad.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.153
Yeah, it will be.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.193
Hey yo, isn't that?

09:22.328 --> 09:23.328
Yup.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.499
We got a celebrity here,
ANT this year y'all, yo,

09:27.567 --> 09:29.901
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

09:31.137 --> 09:32.938
My man J is officially
in the building.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.308
Damn, dude is fine.

09:38.311 --> 09:42.280
That's my roomie, Jayven
Lapierre, his daddy is-

09:42.348 --> 09:43.782
Jimmy Lapierre.

09:43.849 --> 09:44.983
The singer?

09:45.051 --> 09:45.951
Yeah.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.086
Everyone samples his
music, I love him.

09:48.487 --> 09:50.422
Music is in his blood, so
you know, they put him

09:50.489 --> 09:51.489
on the line.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.360
Do not pass go
with his fine ass.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.034
Yeah, we don't all
snap our fingers.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.837
That's what's up.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.172
Okay.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.438
Dr. Sean Taylor.

10:41.540 --> 10:42.540
Look at you.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.476
You know you got the
folks talking about you.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.344
ANT's great black hope.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.147
You got some big
shoes to fill, man.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.882
ANT hasn't won a
classic since what?

10:50.916 --> 10:52.250
Since Dr. Lee left to
conduct the

10:52.318 --> 10:54.119
Chicago Philharmonic?

10:54.420 --> 10:56.988
That's six years ago.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.057
Six years.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.492
What you want, Kevin?

11:01.494 --> 11:02.494
What I want?

11:03.229 --> 11:04.863
I want to see my brother!

11:05.931 --> 11:07.432
You know I shouldn't
feel bad directing over

11:07.500 --> 11:09.401
at Southern State,
considering I did my

11:09.468 --> 11:11.503
marching right here at ANT.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.838
Yeah but, loyalty was
never your thing, right?

11:14.073 --> 11:15.073
Loyalty?

11:15.908 --> 11:17.175
Were you feeling very
loyal when you challenged

11:17.243 --> 11:18.410
me for section leader?

11:19.679 --> 11:24.215
Mr. Big Shot Junior, just
couldn't wait in line.

11:24.717 --> 11:27.118
Kevin, I took section
leader from you because

11:27.186 --> 11:29.320
you ran along with your ego.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.222
No, you took it because
you always thought you

11:31.290 --> 11:32.457
were better than me.

11:37.029 --> 11:41.933
Oh... man, is that Nia?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.328
Mmm, you know Nia still
look good, I divorced that

11:44.370 --> 11:45.870
woman five years ago and
she still do something to

11:45.938 --> 11:48.306
me man just, mmm.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.577
I guess we both lost a lot.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.384
I'll leave to your unpacking.

12:00.986 --> 12:02.153
See you on the battlefield.

12:18.704 --> 12:21.539
So, uh, I'm supposed to
be taking roll of all the

12:21.607 --> 12:23.942
finest honey's in here, so
I know I got to shake off

12:24.009 --> 12:25.009
your name.

12:27.513 --> 12:28.513
Oh what?

12:28.514 --> 12:29.647
No name?

12:30.082 --> 12:31.015
Okay then, what's your section?

12:31.083 --> 12:32.617
I mean, not that
it's not obvious.

12:33.385 --> 12:34.619
Oh, is it?

12:35.054 --> 12:37.956
Oh yeah, I mean, ANT
always has the baddest

12:38.023 --> 12:39.457
dance team of any band.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.093
So, I'm a dancer?

12:42.728 --> 12:43.728
Yeah, no doubt.

12:45.531 --> 12:46.598
What the?

12:47.199 --> 12:48.199
Hoo!

12:49.401 --> 12:50.935
Welcome to hell week.

12:51.303 --> 12:52.537
Craps.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.010

So, word around campus

13:04.216 --> 13:07.218

13:07.620 --> 13:08.620

13:12.691 --> 13:16.227
As of right now, I'm known
to you all as 'big brother

13:16.295 --> 13:17.295

13:17.296 --> 13:18.196
Greetings big brother

13:18.264 --> 13:19.330

13:19.398 --> 13:20.498
You know why?

13:20.566 --> 13:23.968
'Cause when I play, I play
so good, it makes people

13:24.036 --> 13:25.069
want to what bustin'?

13:25.137 --> 13:25.637
Run tell that!

13:26.705 --> 13:28.306

13:37.116 --> 13:39.984
You will refer to me
as 'the storm chaser, '

13:41.086 --> 13:43.087
because I'm gonna be
raining down on your ass

13:43.155 --> 13:45.223
all during orientation!

13:45.758 --> 13:48.493
Now, let's see what I'm
working with here craps.

13:49.428 --> 13:53.364
Jayven Lapierre, you
come on pedigree with your

13:53.432 --> 13:54.432
famous pops.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.568
Strap up.

14:02.708 --> 14:06.544
Danielle Raymond, strap up.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.081
We bought to have an
old fashion drum off.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.976
Not bad... for craps.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.984
So whats up?

14:46.752 --> 14:48.086
Dani the drummer.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.589
Looks like, my skills.

14:56.795 --> 14:59.297
All right, listen up
craps, you're all wearing

14:59.365 --> 15:03.001
white, because right
now you are invisible.

15:03.602 --> 15:07.272
You're nothing, you
have to earn your blue.

15:07.773 --> 15:10.408
And you do that when we
see blood, sweat, and

15:10.476 --> 15:11.476
tears.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.312
Now, who's band is this?

15:14.380 --> 15:15.380
Your band!

15:15.447 --> 15:16.714
Who's band?

15:16.782 --> 15:18.283
Your band big brother oh-ra,
sir!

15:18.350 --> 15:19.350
Oh-ra.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.086
Oh, I beg to differ.

15:24.156 --> 15:27.725
Right now, this band
belongs to no one.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.963
This band will never
belong to anyone, you must

15:32.031 --> 15:34.565
belong to the band
to become champions.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.310
You hear that?

15:45.678 --> 15:47.578
That's ANT 2002.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.180
You serious?

15:49.181 --> 15:50.281
Back when the Marching
Panthers stood for

15:50.349 --> 15:51.349
something.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.320
And you, my friends, are
coasting on the reputation

15:55.387 --> 15:58.356
built on the back of
the old school ANT.

15:58.857 --> 16:01.993
I'll have no identify, no
one knows what ANT stands

16:02.061 --> 16:03.261
for anymore.

16:04.263 --> 16:07.465
And a team with no
identity, is no team.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.301
You have to know who you
were to understand

16:10.369 --> 16:11.402
who you are.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.605
With identity, comes purpose.

16:15.274 --> 16:16.674
With purpose, comes
change, and with that

16:16.742 --> 16:21.112
change, you will rebuild
this band and win

16:21.180 --> 16:22.246
the classics.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.048
What is the ANT creed?

16:27.720 --> 16:28.720
C'mon, let's go.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.289
Y'all do a push up,
c'mon down, c'mon,

16:31.357 --> 16:32.623
c'mon soldier, let's go.

16:33.359 --> 16:33.658
There we go.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.226
Yeah.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.068
Score, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.470
Get up there, get up.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.398
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

16:49.408 --> 16:50.408
One drops, you all drop.

16:50.809 --> 16:51.809
Move it.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.504
Dani, don't be the reason
we start over, let's go!

16:55.180 --> 16:57.382
Dani, that's not fast
enough, let's move,

16:57.449 --> 16:58.449
let's move.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.785
C'mon Dani, you
can do it, c'mon.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.200
Man, y'all are
sleeping out here.

17:16.468 --> 17:18.669
Yo Jay, wake your
crap brothers up.

17:37.956 --> 17:39.357
Yo, yo, yo, yo,
yo, yo stop playing.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.359
Raymond, who told
you you can play?

17:42.394 --> 17:44.162
I was just-You play when
we say you play,

17:44.229 --> 17:46.497
you got it?

17:47.466 --> 17:50.535
Dude, Dani, fall back in line.

18:05.951 --> 18:06.951
Ahh.

18:07.619 --> 18:08.619
Ugh.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.821
Oh my god.

18:12.357 --> 18:14.625
Someone needs to remind
"ass-mondi," that hazing

18:14.693 --> 18:15.693
is illegal.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.195
He's treating you crazy, D.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.530
No, he's treating me like
a drummer, I knew the drum

18:19.598 --> 18:20.631
line was hard core.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.800
He is just trying
to get in my head.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.435
Damn.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.771
Dang girl, that
envelope is hella thick.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.540
My parents stopped
paying my cell phone bill.

18:30.242 --> 18:31.442
You need to change your plan.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.377
Ugh, I need to get a job.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.848
Just do what I do, I run
up other people's phone

18:36.915 --> 18:37.915
bills.

18:38.517 --> 18:39.817
Boy, give me my phone back!

18:40.352 --> 18:41.352
I'm taking a selfie.

18:41.653 --> 18:42.653
Before you lose a finger.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.461
Excuse me, Dean Phillips,
I read online that you

18:50.529 --> 18:52.230
were looking for an
office assistant.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.899
I'm sorry, but most of the
work study positions go

18:54.967 --> 18:57.535
just as quickly as the
notices go up, you have to

18:57.603 --> 18:58.603
be fast.

18:59.338 --> 19:00.338
How's the band going?

19:01.573 --> 19:03.341
Easier than
trying to find a job.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.910
Oh, I remember struggling
being a Marching Panther.

19:06.411 --> 19:07.411
You were in the band?

19:07.880 --> 19:10.248
Dance co-captain by
day, dishwasher by night.

19:10.749 --> 19:12.617
And the owner did not
believe in running dishes

19:12.684 --> 19:13.684
through the machine, so.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.455
Look, if you're willing
to work hard-I am.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.492
Then I'll put in a
call to my old boss.

19:21.827 --> 19:22.827
Thank you, Dean Phillips!

19:26.298 --> 19:28.332
I'm just saying, how are
you going to be a soul

19:28.400 --> 19:31.235
food spot and a coffee bar?

19:31.303 --> 19:32.870
It's too confusing.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.573
May I have a two piece
dark and a soy mocha,

19:35.641 --> 19:36.641
no whip?

19:37.409 --> 19:38.769
See, that doesn't
even sound right.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.313
You say something?

19:43.749 --> 19:46.517
Guys, Dean Phillips is
awesome, she talked to the

19:46.585 --> 19:48.686
owner, and he's gonna
try me out on a trial run.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.722
A trial run means, I
better not see you hooking

19:51.790 --> 19:53.858
your friends up with free food.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.860
Let's celebrate, I'll get
the table, you guys get

19:55.928 --> 19:56.928
this check?

19:58.330 --> 19:59.330
Well.

20:22.454 --> 20:23.454
Hey.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.426
So, uh, you're the real
deal out there on that

20:28.493 --> 20:29.493
field.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.308
You know, that's
what I'm looking for.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.430
Maybe you should put
in your application.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.567
You must hate that there's
one girl whose not fallen

20:36.635 --> 20:38.769
under the Jayven Lapierre spell.

20:38.837 --> 20:39.837
Ah ha, really?

20:40.872 --> 20:42.273
I wonder what she
trying to prove.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.308
She could ask the same thing.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.644
You know, when you have me
play, I ain't got to prove

20:46.712 --> 20:48.012
nothing.

20:48.513 --> 20:49.513
Are you sure?

20:49.982 --> 20:50.815
Because all you do is
throw lines at me and

20:50.882 --> 20:53.351
probably every
other girl in here.

20:54.786 --> 20:57.588
I bet you can't say one
real thing, just one.

20:58.790 --> 20:59.790
Okay, so what?

21:00.692 --> 21:01.692
You think you know me?

21:03.729 --> 21:05.730
Boy, I know about 20 of yous.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.037
Well okay, Ms. Raymond.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.012
It's been a long three
weeks, tomorrow we'll have

21:21.079 --> 21:23.414
the tree shaking,
auditions to determine

21:23.482 --> 21:24.482
your rankings.

21:25.717 --> 21:32.290
P1, P2, you're guaranteed
to march, P3, P4 stick

21:32.357 --> 21:35.426
with it, you want it?

21:35.961 --> 21:36.961
You'll earn it.

21:46.938 --> 21:47.938
Jayven.

21:49.174 --> 21:52.576
Hey, hey, sorry I
didn't hear you.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.945
Wow, you're here late.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.760
Trying to be ready for tomorrow.

21:57.516 --> 21:59.516
Ahh guilty, guilty, that's
why I've been practicing

21:59.551 --> 22:00.551
here each night.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.788
Why do you look shocked?

22:06.158 --> 22:07.692
C'mon Jay, you
know you got this.

22:08.627 --> 22:09.627
But why?

22:09.961 --> 22:10.961
What?

22:10.996 --> 22:12.063
Because of my pops?

22:12.130 --> 22:13.764
Listen, I got hit because
of my skills, not his

22:13.832 --> 22:15.833
connections.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.069
You know, people talk like
they know about my life,

22:18.136 --> 22:19.136
but they don't.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.138
Bet they'd shut up if they
knew the ugly ass truth.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.408
He ain't all that.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.444
I didn't mean-No.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.879
You wanted me to tell you
something real, well there

22:28.947 --> 22:29.947
you go.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.183
You can add a room.

22:37.255 --> 22:40.391
My parents used to argue
a lot when I was younger.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.992
They almost got a divorce once.

22:43.829 --> 22:45.730
So, I used to spend a
lot of time at Tyree's.

22:47.632 --> 22:50.501
And, he had this drum set,
and at first I was just

22:50.569 --> 22:54.004
messing around, but then
it turned into something.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.542
It felt like everything I
needed to say was in

22:58.610 --> 22:59.610
those sticks.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.079
It still feels like it.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.385
So now you know something
real about me, too.

23:08.587 --> 23:10.488
Guess we all gotta
bring our A game.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.525
I plan to.

23:25.036 --> 23:27.138
Now as is the ANT tradition,
a senior line will determine

23:27.205 --> 23:28.205
the rankings.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.174
Leon, you're first up.

23:36.214 --> 23:37.381
Try to impress me.

24:00.305 --> 24:01.305
P1.

24:07.212 --> 24:08.212
P2, Mr. Murphy.

24:16.321 --> 24:17.321
P1.

24:47.085 --> 24:50.888
P1, congratulations
Mr. Lapierre.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.860
Dani, it's you.

25:38.303 --> 25:39.303
Seniors.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.363
Ms. Raymond, you're P2.

26:16.908 --> 26:21.512
You D, I know you wanted
P1, but you'll get there.

26:23.114 --> 26:25.482
I was good, I played my ass off.

26:26.685 --> 26:30.554
Oh really, oh that's funny
'cause I can still see it.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.224
All right D, I know you
good, there's no doubt

26:34.292 --> 26:37.361
about that, but maybe
you're just not ready

26:37.429 --> 26:38.429
for the senate.

26:40.966 --> 26:44.668
Did anyone hear the
forecast this morning?

26:45.537 --> 26:47.471
For the next few weeks,
there will be a constant

26:47.539 --> 26:50.975
unrelenting roaring sound.

26:52.644 --> 26:54.378
Can you hear it?

26:59.117 --> 27:01.318
Can you hear it?

27:05.590 --> 27:07.224
You are officially
a part of a legacy.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.494
You are this year's
Marching Panthers.

27:13.064 --> 27:15.466
With identity comes
purpose, and with purpose

27:15.533 --> 27:16.533
comes change.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
Knock knock.

28:25.570 --> 28:26.570
Big day tomorrow.

28:27.105 --> 28:28.639
Yeah, first game sets the tone.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.374
Yeah.

28:31.209 --> 28:35.112
Wow, is that us back in the day?

28:35.680 --> 28:37.114
Back to Lee,
wearing a tight shirt.

28:37.849 --> 28:41.452
Well, word around campus
is you do too, so you

28:41.519 --> 28:43.187
don't have anything
to be nervous about.

28:43.588 --> 28:44.588
I'm not.

28:45.690 --> 28:50.160
I dated you for three
years, I know you... enough

28:50.228 --> 28:52.529
to remember your
pre-game tradition.

28:53.598 --> 28:55.499
Two piece with hot
sauce, and a cherry coke.

28:55.834 --> 28:56.834
Woo-hoo.

29:05.343 --> 29:10.180
Sean, I umm-I
know, I should eat.

29:10.782 --> 29:13.016
Right, right, you should eat.

29:14.686 --> 29:17.955
Well umm, good luck, I
don't think you need it.

29:23.061 --> 29:24.061
Wow.

29:38.576 --> 29:42.646
Huh, so you didn't go to
home grown with everybody?

29:43.281 --> 29:44.601
I wanted to be
ready for tomorrow.

29:45.183 --> 29:47.384
Mm, okay.

29:50.655 --> 29:51.655
Hey, you alright?

29:52.357 --> 29:53.690
I mean, I know I'm sexy and all.

29:53.758 --> 29:54.658
Boy, please!

29:54.726 --> 29:56.093
Please what?

29:58.129 --> 29:59.029
What?

29:59.097 --> 30:00.364
You think I'm like what?

30:00.431 --> 30:05.602
Scared, nervous, in awe maybe?

30:06.437 --> 30:08.277
You know what I'm learning
about myself lately?

30:08.873 --> 30:10.073
I'm not afraid of anything.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.850
Now who's
scared, Mr. Lapierre?

30:20.752 --> 30:21.752
Good night.

30:32.063 --> 30:32.596
Yes sir, today is

30:32.664 --> 30:33.831
the unveiling.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.698
I'm trying to see what
Dr. Taylor and this new

30:35.700 --> 30:38.502
ANT band are
bringing to the table.

30:38.570 --> 30:39.403
I got my cooler-

30:39.470 --> 30:40.704
C'mon, I'm not gonna
miss the bus.

30:40.772 --> 30:42.906
Shoot, I forgot my
hat, go on without me.

30:42.974 --> 30:43.974
Okay.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.147
She been ready, I told
her to come through after

30:50.215 --> 30:50.881
the game.

30:50.949 --> 30:52.115
You already know.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.685
Woo boy, we about to
kick the Glorie's ass.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.020
And the senate is
tight as hell this year.

30:58.089 --> 30:59.857
You can thank me for that, son.

31:00.325 --> 31:01.658
Yo, what you do is dirty yo.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.760
Man, I ain't having no
bitches on the line,

31:03.828 --> 31:05.762
I don't care who a
cousin is, we ain't

31:05.830 --> 31:06.496
that desperate.

31:06.764 --> 31:07.764
I hear you.

31:07.832 --> 31:08.832
Bro.

31:19.677 --> 31:20.777
Look, here comes that
football player that keeps

31:20.845 --> 31:21.845
checking me out.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.916
Y'all tear it up out
there, I'll be watching.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.670
We don't have enough
bitches on the line.

34:00.972 --> 34:03.306
And I ain't having no
bitches on the line.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.431
Yo, ruin your period?

34:28.900 --> 34:30.000
Yo Armondi, chill out.

34:30.435 --> 34:31.435
Let me handle this.

34:32.136 --> 34:33.136
Yeah, handle her.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.940
Tyree, I was just trying
to show that a bitch can

34:38.009 --> 34:41.178
be on the senate, that's
what I am right Armondi?

34:44.315 --> 34:45.435
He got the line to block me.

34:46.951 --> 34:48.871
Is there something I need
to handle, Mr. Raymond?

34:51.121 --> 34:52.121
No, sir.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.961
Get your line together,
Mr. Raymond... or I'll do

34:58.029 --> 34:59.029
it for you.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.138
Ty, he...

35:18.182 --> 35:20.283
It's going to be okay, girl.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.160
So, you gonna let them run you?

35:24.989 --> 35:27.090
Look, this is my
line, all right?

35:28.059 --> 35:29.726
I know we're family, so
I'm gonna give it to you

35:29.794 --> 35:32.062
straight, you just messed up, D.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.299
Why don't you help
unpack the drums, P2.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.071
Hey.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.841
So what happened on that field?

35:45.243 --> 35:46.209
I just got so mad after
I found out what

35:46.277 --> 35:47.344
Armondi did.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.180
Setting her off on the field.

35:51.549 --> 35:52.782
So you think I set it off?

35:53.918 --> 36:00.857
Oh yeah, no doubt, on the
field and in the hallway.

36:08.933 --> 36:10.867
Devon Miles.

36:13.037 --> 36:14.538
Oh, I remember that hard
head gave you a run for

36:14.605 --> 36:16.406
your money your senior year.

36:17.041 --> 36:18.942
Yeah, then he graduated
and turned into P-Diddy.

36:19.477 --> 36:20.477
Mhm.

36:20.545 --> 36:22.045
Music, clothes-Yup
Vanity water, my boy is

36:22.113 --> 36:23.480
everywhere.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.348
Oh god, he was cute.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.930
If he wasn't married,
I'd ask you to hook me up.

36:28.486 --> 36:29.526
Y'all still friends right?

36:30.588 --> 36:32.668
I don't think you need any
help from that department.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.859
You'd be surprised, after
the divorce I just,

36:35.927 --> 36:39.396
I needed a break from men.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.098
I had to get my
head right, you know?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.441
So, I started dating my career.

36:46.871 --> 36:47.871
Shut up.

36:49.473 --> 36:52.042
I'm just saying, I can't
remember the last time a

36:52.109 --> 36:56.079
man picked me up in his
car and offered me some

36:56.147 --> 37:00.984
Boone's Farm wine and
swept me away to some

37:01.052 --> 37:04.154
real R&B, grown and sexy music.

37:04.956 --> 37:07.624
Wait, hold up, Boone's Farm?

37:08.059 --> 37:09.779
Don't act like you
don't drink Boone's Farm.

37:09.961 --> 37:10.827
That's a long time.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.563
Don't-Don't remind me.

37:13.631 --> 37:14.931
Grown and sexy, huh?

37:14.999 --> 37:16.399
But, I still got
the moves though.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.034
Can you move to this?

37:23.007 --> 37:24.407
Ohh, woo!

37:25.109 --> 37:27.177
Yeah, I still got
the moves though.

37:27.945 --> 37:30.180
I do too.

37:32.149 --> 37:33.149
One lows.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.951
Did you just body roll?

37:35.286 --> 37:36.286
Oh you know, that's it.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.188
Hey, mhm.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.256
Mhm.

37:39.257 --> 37:44.060
Awh, you still got it.

37:44.128 --> 37:46.296
Dr. Taylor, you listening
to fifth quarter?

37:46.564 --> 37:47.844
Southern State is talking smack!

37:49.200 --> 37:50.200
Oh.

37:54.338 --> 37:55.105
Big Southern State

37:55.172 --> 37:58.174
and ANT match up this weekend,

37:58.242 --> 38:00.243
any concerns about the
Bears' long standing

38:00.311 --> 38:01.344
rivalry?

38:01.679 --> 38:02.846
Oh yeah, I'm terrified.

38:04.415 --> 38:06.149
Look here man, my
brother's a good leader,

38:06.217 --> 38:07.317
and from what I've heard
they had a decent show

38:07.385 --> 38:08.485
this weekend.

38:08.552 --> 38:10.553
But, ANT hasn't
been a force in years.

38:11.222 --> 38:12.289
Mmm.

38:12.356 --> 38:13.390
So, from what I know, the
Panthers are about to

38:13.457 --> 38:15.058
get declawed.

38:17.728 --> 38:19.062
He's just trying to get in
my head before a game in

38:19.130 --> 38:20.196
the classic.

38:20.264 --> 38:22.632
Don't let him, this school
needs this band to be

38:22.700 --> 38:24.501
great, and you can do that.

38:25.703 --> 38:28.972
Oh, don't worry, I
still got some moves too.

38:31.008 --> 38:33.310
Rivalry goes back years,

38:33.377 --> 38:35.312
and we will show that
ANT can reign supreme.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.481
You talk about identity,
this game this weekend,

38:38.549 --> 38:40.283
this is ANT's identity.

38:40.351 --> 38:44.020
So, I want your undivided
attention, when you wake

38:44.088 --> 38:46.089
up, when you're in line at
the cafeteria, when you on

38:46.157 --> 38:48.591
the phone begging for
money from your momma, run

38:48.659 --> 38:52.128
your music, live in it.

38:52.396 --> 38:54.397
Well, I hear you're doing well.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.334
It's a good thing, since I
put my dishwasher rep

38:57.401 --> 38:58.401
on the line.

38:59.236 --> 39:00.236
Thanks again for this.

39:00.604 --> 39:01.604
You're welcome.

39:02.707 --> 39:03.707
You okay?

39:05.609 --> 39:06.609
Truth?

39:06.744 --> 39:07.744
Mm-hmm.

39:08.713 --> 39:09.713
Not really.

39:11.582 --> 39:13.483
It's just band stuff.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.786
Well, as dean of the
students, you can tell me

39:16.854 --> 39:17.854
anything.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.190
Let's sit.

39:25.596 --> 39:27.116
I just don't know
how to feel about it.

39:28.799 --> 39:29.799
Yo, can I use the iron?

39:33.504 --> 39:35.138
Yeah, but I'm gonna
need you to put all that

39:35.206 --> 39:37.440
chocolate away, if
I can't have none.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.009
You know better, okay?

39:40.811 --> 39:41.811
C'mon.

39:43.948 --> 39:45.648
D girl, don't even worry
about Armondi, I heard he

39:45.716 --> 39:48.418
barely made the line himself.

39:48.486 --> 39:51.421
He's insecure, so he lashes out.

39:51.789 --> 39:53.589
And that's because he
thinks he can break you,

39:54.592 --> 39:56.292
'cause he do that
to me all the time.

39:57.495 --> 40:00.330
Skinny, black, gay
preacher's son with the

40:00.398 --> 40:01.731
big ass curly 'fro.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.601
Damn, how many crosses
did you have to bear?

40:05.469 --> 40:07.103
Enough to decide to
put them all down when I

40:07.171 --> 40:08.338
stepped foot on this line.

40:09.206 --> 40:11.508
Look, let him be stupid,
you just keep doing you,

40:11.575 --> 40:12.675
all right?

40:14.578 --> 40:15.578
Oh, I am.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.714
I already handled it.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.251
Hey.

40:21.852 --> 40:24.387
So, uh, some of us are
going out tonight, and we

40:24.455 --> 40:29.859
were, well I wanted to
see if you wanted to hang.

40:33.664 --> 40:39.502
Well, mmm, I don't
have to work tonight.

40:41.639 --> 40:44.107
Yo, we partying or what?

41:07.631 --> 41:09.732
There goes Josh, trying
to get to Tasha again.

41:16.340 --> 41:18.174
That is so not happening.

42:12.796 --> 42:14.731
I hope the universe is
taking notes for my

42:14.798 --> 42:15.798
new man.

42:15.966 --> 42:16.966
I can take my own notes.

42:17.868 --> 42:19.536
Not tonight, JFK.

42:20.971 --> 42:21.971
C'mon.

42:22.973 --> 42:25.375
Hey don't worry, look, I'm
sure the line will come

42:25.442 --> 42:26.676
around and so will our money.

42:27.745 --> 42:30.280
I'm not worried, I'll
make them recognize.

42:31.015 --> 42:33.550
Is this the brand new Dani?

42:34.752 --> 42:35.985
I like the sound of that.

42:36.787 --> 42:39.856
Okay, okay, but let me
ask, do you think she's

42:39.924 --> 42:42.525
got enough room for a
guy who's kind of sexy?

42:43.460 --> 42:44.460
And real cocky?

42:46.564 --> 42:47.564
We'll see.

42:47.798 --> 42:48.798
C'mon.

42:49.033 --> 42:50.967
Yo Jay, whats up player?

42:51.602 --> 42:52.602
Rizzy.

42:53.170 --> 42:53.536
I ain't even know
you was comin' man.

42:54.305 --> 42:55.505
You pops is about to do a set.

42:55.739 --> 42:56.739
Oh yeah?

42:57.541 --> 42:58.274
Yeah, I was just kickin'
it with some friends from

42:58.342 --> 42:59.342
school.

42:59.643 --> 43:03.313
Oh right, you're
Mr. Joe College now.

43:03.380 --> 43:04.581
So, you coming in?

43:04.648 --> 43:07.383
Um no, I'm sure he's got
enough fans for himself.

43:07.451 --> 43:08.451
It'll be fun.

43:08.452 --> 43:09.752
Y'all Jay's dad is
about to perform.

43:09.820 --> 43:10.353
What?

43:10.421 --> 43:10.787
Let's go.

43:10.854 --> 43:11.688
What?

43:11.755 --> 43:12.488
I'm down.

43:12.556 --> 43:12.989
Yeah.

43:13.057 --> 43:14.057
Let's do it.

43:19.063 --> 43:22.298
All right, let's get
ready for some old school,

43:22.366 --> 43:24.801
get in your blood type music.

43:24.868 --> 43:28.805
From Atlanta's very
own, Mr. Jimmy Lapierre.

43:37.014 --> 43:38.414
Is your dad okay?

43:38.616 --> 43:42.051
He's good, nothing new.

43:49.793 --> 43:50.793
Too bad I'm cool.

43:50.894 --> 43:51.894
Woo.

43:53.597 --> 43:54.764
Ugh, how y'all doing?

43:57.201 --> 44:00.069
Heard my boy was
here, where you at son?

44:01.905 --> 44:03.406
C'mon put the light, put
the light up, I want to

44:03.474 --> 44:04.474
see you.

44:07.845 --> 44:11.314
Ha-ha-ha, that's my
C right there, ha.

44:13.083 --> 44:15.752
Uh ah, give him a minute.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.340
I was worried.

44:40.778 --> 44:42.058
You ain't got to worry about me.

44:46.250 --> 44:47.250
Seriously?

44:47.851 --> 44:48.851
What?

44:49.453 --> 44:50.586
I'll open a window.

44:52.322 --> 44:54.002
So you're just gonna
put that wall back up?

44:54.391 --> 44:56.726
Cool ass Jayven,
ain't afraid of anything.

45:01.098 --> 45:03.132
Okay whatever,
but this ain't you.

45:04.768 --> 45:05.868
You know, maybe it is.

45:07.104 --> 45:08.404
I mean, you saw my pops tonight.

45:10.541 --> 45:13.643
You know people think that
I live this strong life,

45:13.711 --> 45:14.711
but it's not.

45:15.779 --> 45:20.049
The great Jimmy Lapierre
ran through all his money

45:20.117 --> 45:24.921
thanks to drinking,
drugs, and women.

45:25.956 --> 45:30.093
Damn and I tried to help
him but, now he tours just

45:30.160 --> 45:31.794
so he can get his fix.

45:33.063 --> 45:34.063
So you know what?

45:34.998 --> 45:38.034
Yeah, I do what I gotta
do so I can make my

45:38.102 --> 45:39.102
own money.

45:39.236 --> 45:40.036
Okay, but selling weed?

45:40.104 --> 45:41.104
Yes!

45:51.181 --> 45:52.982
I'm screwed up Dani.

45:55.352 --> 46:01.924
But, I'm trying to fix
it, being here, earning my

46:01.992 --> 46:07.029
spot on this senate, that
was my escape from

46:07.097 --> 46:08.331
all of that.

46:15.105 --> 46:17.807
Until tonight.

46:48.572 --> 46:50.173
Maybe you should go.

47:14.531 --> 47:15.531
Hey.

47:18.135 --> 47:19.135
Hey.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.741
You're not gonna get all
clingy on me now are ya?

47:27.277 --> 47:31.214
Oh, I planned to get real
clingy, I've told you

47:31.281 --> 47:33.049
too much.

47:39.256 --> 47:40.256
Daddy.

47:40.457 --> 47:41.924
Hmm, hi.

47:43.160 --> 47:44.861
I got a call from the cell
phone company, your bill

47:44.928 --> 47:45.928
is late.

47:46.463 --> 47:48.197
I was, I was gonna
pay it when I got paid.

47:48.632 --> 47:50.299
Yeah well, this is real
world stuff honey, due

47:50.367 --> 47:52.101
dates matter, you
want me to cover it?

47:52.302 --> 47:53.662
No, I got it, I'm
mailing it today.

47:54.471 --> 47:55.972
Okay, how did you make out?

47:59.309 --> 48:00.309
Umm, make out?

48:01.411 --> 48:02.945
Yeah, tree shaking, you
said you were shoeing for

48:03.013 --> 48:04.013
something.

48:04.381 --> 48:07.583
Yeah, the
audition, umm I made P1.

48:08.986 --> 48:10.887
I hope studying fits
in there somewhere.

48:11.922 --> 48:14.457
Yeah, I'm handling it, trust me.

48:16.526 --> 48:20.429
Baby look, now there's
plenty of semester left,

48:20.497 --> 48:21.577
Spelman is a viable option.

48:23.500 --> 48:28.037
This weekend, we go to war,
on our own field, against

48:28.105 --> 48:29.472
Southern State.

48:30.107 --> 48:32.141
Now, I'm all too aware
that ANT has suffered some

48:32.209 --> 48:35.144
casualties in this war
the last few years.

48:35.212 --> 48:37.179
That all ends right now.

48:37.247 --> 48:38.314
Who are we?

48:38.382 --> 48:39.415
The Marching Panthers.

48:39.483 --> 48:40.549
Who are we?

48:40.617 --> 48:42.151
The Marching Panthers!

48:42.719 --> 48:44.020
That's right.

48:59.670 --> 49:02.138
Get some rest, dismissed.

49:02.806 --> 49:05.474
Percussion, stay on the field.

49:08.045 --> 49:09.378
Dean Phillips has just
brought a situation to my

49:09.446 --> 49:12.415
attention, and as a result
I will allow a challenge

49:12.482 --> 49:13.649
from a P1 snare.

49:15.085 --> 49:16.125
Ms. Raymond, step forward.

49:19.756 --> 49:21.157
Dr. Taylor, that means
she's part of the senate.

49:21.224 --> 49:23.326
Yes it does, Mr. Mason.

49:27.230 --> 49:31.167
As is the rule, you
challenged the last

49:31.234 --> 49:32.501
drummer placed on the line.

49:35.172 --> 49:41.344
Mr. Lapierre,
step up, step up.

49:52.456 --> 49:53.456
All right then.

50:48.812 --> 50:51.380
Not this time, Mr.
Lapierre, don't be

50:51.448 --> 50:53.716
discouraged at this
moment, learn from it.

50:56.386 --> 50:57.746
Welcome to the
senate, Ms. Raymond.

50:59.423 --> 51:00.423
Dismissed.

51:02.626 --> 51:05.261
Jayven, Jayven.

51:09.299 --> 51:10.733
I'm sorry, I didn't
know that that was gonna

51:10.801 --> 51:12.701
happen, I talked to Dean-

51:12.769 --> 51:15.738
You knew, what being
P1 meant to me.

51:18.875 --> 51:23.245
But it's cool,
brand new Dani, right?

51:30.187 --> 51:32.621
Yay P1!

51:34.458 --> 51:35.458
What?

51:35.525 --> 51:37.760
Look you had a problem,
you took action, you

51:37.828 --> 51:40.096
didn't know you were going
to de-ball your man in the

51:40.163 --> 51:41.063
process.

51:41.131 --> 51:42.131
Tasha.

51:42.532 --> 51:43.666
We just got together.

51:49.372 --> 51:50.772
So, I guess you
guys heard about me.

51:51.441 --> 51:53.676
Ain't no body heard
nothing about you, JFK.

51:55.378 --> 51:57.480
I can't march until I
get my chem grade up.

51:58.815 --> 52:00.116
You know, who the hell
knows how many confirmed

52:00.183 --> 52:01.783
elements there are in
the periodic table.

52:03.920 --> 52:08.824
118 as of 2012, 98 of
the 118 occur naturally.

52:10.460 --> 52:11.460
What?

52:11.928 --> 52:12.561
What are you?

52:12.629 --> 52:14.330
Some kind of sexy genius?

52:14.764 --> 52:15.764
Maybe.

52:19.469 --> 52:22.338
Umm, I have a
date, so I have to go.

52:22.405 --> 52:24.173
But, if I see Jay in the
room later, I'll talk to

52:24.241 --> 52:25.374
him okay?

52:35.785 --> 52:37.052
I've been texting you.

52:38.655 --> 52:39.855
Who are you, his momma?

52:41.291 --> 52:42.424
Look, what's going on?

52:42.959 --> 52:44.093
What did I do?

52:45.562 --> 52:49.832
Oh, oh yeah that's right,
you, you wanted me to say

52:49.900 --> 52:51.233
something real right?

52:54.504 --> 52:58.707
Well this is me, just like
you're a daddy's little

52:58.775 --> 53:02.444
girl who had to run to the
Dean's office in order to

53:02.512 --> 53:03.546
get her way.

53:08.785 --> 53:09.785
Jay.

53:10.187 --> 53:11.187
Jay.

53:12.522 --> 53:13.622
Y'all go on ahead.

53:19.462 --> 53:21.330
You better bring it
tomorrow, trying to roll

53:21.398 --> 53:22.698
with the senate.

53:30.640 --> 53:33.309
Give it up for the
unstoppable Southern State.

53:35.979 --> 53:40.549
And now, presenting the
Atlanta A&T Marching Panthers.

53:42.485 --> 53:43.719
Focus.

53:43.787 --> 53:47.323
Under the new
direction of Dr. Sean Taylor.

53:47.390 --> 53:49.091
Remember what we're here to do.

55:53.016 --> 55:54.416
Okay, okay.

55:54.484 --> 55:56.819
It actually looks like A&T

55:56.886 --> 55:58.687
has gotten their groove back.

55:58.755 --> 56:01.123
They just killed Southern State.

56:05.328 --> 56:06.862
The crowd agrees.

56:20.977 --> 56:22.211
Oh but wait a minute,

56:22.278 --> 56:24.847
Southern State is not
giving up that easy.

56:24.914 --> 56:27.950
Their drum line is
making a call to war.

56:28.017 --> 56:29.151
They want more.

56:37.193 --> 56:38.861
Dr. Taylor, they
wanna battle.

56:38.928 --> 56:40.229
No.

56:40.296 --> 56:42.131
We do what we came to do.

56:45.769 --> 56:46.769
Where you goin'?

56:51.708 --> 56:53.242
Come on.

56:53.309 --> 56:57.246
You scared, baby brother?

56:57.313 --> 57:00.249
Senate, fall in.

57:00.316 --> 57:03.051
You heard Dr. Taylor,
Senate, fall in.

57:03.119 --> 57:03.752
Hell yeah.

57:03.820 --> 57:04.520
Yo, Jay, you in for Dani.

57:04.587 --> 57:05.220
What?

57:05.288 --> 57:06.288
Should be my spot anyway.

57:06.356 --> 57:07.890
Yo, Armondi, this is my line.

57:07.957 --> 57:10.225
Dr. Taylor, we want to
win, we need our best.

57:10.293 --> 57:11.994
Jayven.

57:16.499 --> 57:19.468
LaPierre, take the field.

57:19.536 --> 57:21.537
Miss Raymond battles too.

57:21.604 --> 57:23.272
Yo, Dani, keep up on the beat.

57:23.339 --> 57:24.473
Lets go, y'all.

58:02.979 --> 58:03.979
Whoo!

58:59.536 --> 59:01.670
Are we watching this,
ladies and gentleman?

59:01.738 --> 59:04.306
A&T's drum line is killin' it.

59:43.913 --> 59:45.614
Oh no!

59:45.682 --> 59:49.818
She dropped the sticks,
ladies and gentleman.

59:49.886 --> 59:52.187
Automatic win for
Southern State.

59:52.255 --> 59:55.657
Looks like A&T should have
quit while they were ahead.

59:55.725 --> 59:56.959
Stupid Bitch!

59:57.026 --> 59:58.060
Man, watch your mouth.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.130
Ugh!

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:03.999
Whoo!

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.901
Hey!

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:06.802
Lets go.

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.604
Yo, yo, yo, stop playin'.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:11.607
Mondi.

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:17.145
This aint football.
This aint football.

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:23.452
Man, some bands act
straight ghetto.

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:24.519
What's up?

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.325
Brutality on the field.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:36.264
Tyree, are you...

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:37.432
Not now, D.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.805
Yo, what was that
fight all about

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.107
on the field yesterday?

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.675
I know y'all seen it by now.

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:48.644
Southern State and A&T,

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:50.679
it's all over You Tube,

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:53.482
so we know the classic
gonna be fire.

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:54.983
I will handle the band.

01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:56.618
So who's gonna handle you?

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:57.786
The director of the classic

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.287
is threatening to pull
it from the school.

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:01.289
Sponsors are wary due to
the show of violence.

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:03.191
What the hell, Sean?

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:05.360
There's some dissention
among the senate.

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.328
Come on.

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:07.429
This is just as much about you

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:11.099
and your competition
with your brother.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.034
Oh, comin' from the
woman that played

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:13.135
us against each other?

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.336
Oh so you...

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.004
finally wanna talk for real?

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.506
Well lets talk for real.

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.541
Your identity was all
wrapped up in this band.

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:21.249
You broke up with
me senior year.

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:24.146
Yeah, and you landed in my
brother's bed a month later.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.647
I will not let the school suffer

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:28.016
for this nonsense between
you and your brother.

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:33.855
We need the profit and the
exposure from the classic.

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.090
Nia.

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.392
If you can't fix what you
broke, then we're done.

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:45.039
That fight was a disgrace
to your history,

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:47.035
your school and yourselves.

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:49.037
I'd suspend you all,

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:51.873
but A&T's got too much
ridin' on the Classic.

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.861
Miss Raymond and Mr.
LaPierre, step forward.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.481
What is our motto?

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.682
One band, one sound.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:03.185
And yet, it was all about
you Saturday, wasn't it?

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:04.786
What happened on that
field wasn't me.

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:08.290
Who we are at our core
is a series of actions.

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:09.524
Of all the actions
you could've taken,

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:10.892
you chose to turn your
back on your line.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.060
And in that moment,
Miss Raymond,

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:15.430
you were exactly who you are.

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:17.532
Until further notice,
you two are both P4's,

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.900
meaning you participate
fully in practice,

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:20.669
but no performance.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.504
You wanna show boat?

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:23.839
Why don't you show boat
while you clean drums,

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:27.509
haul water, and try to
gain some respect back?

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.377
10 laps.

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.579
Or do you want 20?

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:43.792
Talk about identity and all
I saw on that field was ego.

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:47.162
About extended practices
until further notice.

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.600
Dr. Taylor got the
biggest ego out here.

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.602
Shut up.

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:56.471
There might be a slight
change of plans, people.

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:59.574
I hear the Classic might be
held at a different school.

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:02.377
I'll keep you posted, just
stay tuned in and turnt up.

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.389
Hey.

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.958
It's Sean.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:19.394
I know, long time.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:26.868
Now, save your strength,

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:29.271
still gotta clean these
drums after practice.

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.206
And I want em squeaky clean.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.108
All right, man.

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:33.775
We got it.

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:34.843
No, no, no, no, no.

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.878
I want her to do it.

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:40.515
She started this, now
she can finish it.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.598
Yo!

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:57.899
What up big homie?

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:04.439
I'm sure you all know Devon,

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:07.075
especially since every other
song on the radio is his.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.783
Oh, don't forget
about the Grammy.

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:13.849
Now, you know how I feel about
disruptions during practice.

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:15.817
Man, you called me.

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:18.987
Plus, I am not dressed
to be doing no laps.

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.055
These is my gelins.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.693
Tasha, wait up.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.161
I got a business
proposition for ya.

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:28.763
Not sure I wanna be in
business with ya' JFK?

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:29.965
Look, I need a tutor.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.700
I'm trying to get back on
the field for the Classic

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:35.637
and the chem is kicking
a brother's ass.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.672
What brother?

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.541
All right, I have
a test on Friday,

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.176
and as much as you
try to hide it,

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:44.913
I know you're smart as hell.

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.215
I wouldn't say all that,

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.417
but I aint gonna turn
down no good money.

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:50.719
And I want it in quarters,

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:52.921
cause laundry is
kickin a sista's ass.

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.189
Yeah, you got it.

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:55.156
All right, deal.

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.224
All right.

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:59.413
D, I really appreciate you
offering to MC the Classic.

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:00.362
It's gonna be A&T's best shot

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:01.730
at keeping it here
at the school.

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:02.664
Come on, it's nothing.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.065
It's my pleasure.

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:06.801
I owe so much to A&T.

01:05:06.869 --> 01:05:10.372
I owe a lot to you too, big dog.

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:10.805
What about you?

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:12.641
You good?

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:13.475
Yeah.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.644
Yeah.

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:19.114
You sure?

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:21.850
I don't know man.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:22.918
I always dreamt of
coming back here

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:25.353
and leading this band.

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.055
I was gonna teach teamwork,

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.324
squash egos, let em'
discover who they are,

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:32.127
the power of what they could do.

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.234
I don't even know if I
should be here sometimes.

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:37.165
Come on, man, you was
ready when you graduated.

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:38.934
The band just think they the
center of the world right now,

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:41.136
you gotta show em'
that they not.

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:43.405
Show em' what work is.

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:47.042
What would Quentin
say about you?

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:49.577
Besides, Quentin
definitely aint gonna help

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:51.813
you get back with Nia.

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:56.851
Nia Phillips is lookin'
mighty delicious.

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.286
You married, bro.

01:05:58.354 --> 01:05:59.654
Yeah, happily.

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:00.956
But you aint.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:03.024
Devon Miles.

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:04.359
It's been a long time.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:05.160
Too long.

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:06.628
Oh my goodness.

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:09.331
Oh, thank you so much again for
agreeing to MC the Classic.

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:11.266
I mean thank you.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.635
I always gotta
represent for A&T.

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:14.936
And my boy Sean.

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:21.943
You know what, I gotta make
a couple of phone calls.

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:23.979
I'm gonna go ahead and step out.

01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:25.981
The work of a
mogle's never done.

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:26.748
Thanks again.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:27.816
Yeah, no doubt.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:28.817
You know I still got it.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:29.818
I see.

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:30.885
Get out of here.

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:35.190
So, you called him?

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:38.226
I broke it, I wanted to fix it.

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:40.996
Well, it worked.

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:43.631
The Classic sponsors have
unanimously agreed to overlook

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:45.379
the A&T and Southern State fight

01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:47.736
and Devon's appearance
is gonna be

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.704
a huge draw for the Classic.

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.706
So, thanks for helping
out the school...

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:58.546
Nia, what I said about you
and Kevin, it was low.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:01.850
You know, you had a
role in this too.

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:04.652
You think Kevin is
all about ego?

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.222
Well so are you.

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:10.392
And truthfully, that man
I saw on the field

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:13.862
the other day is the same boy
that ran me off years ago.

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:26.908
 They always question me
try to bring me down 

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:32.580
I took AP Chem in 10th grade.

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:36.217
Some of these study
aids should help.

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:38.586
Damn, in 10th grade I
was trying to step out

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:40.321
of my brothers shadow.

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:41.823
All seven of them.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.692
So you came here to stand out.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.927
You noticed me.

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:48.530
 And the way they
look at us when me 

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.473
Is this high school Tasha?

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:03.344
Did you look cute in glasses.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:06.815
You still do.

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:08.049
Uh uh.

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:09.517
Uh uh.

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:13.154
Head in the books, Josh.

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:21.095
And, thanks.

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.773
I'll be right back.

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:33.475
All right.

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:52.393
Hey.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:53.294
What's up?

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.130
You takin' orders?

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:58.933
Let me get the wings.

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.368
That all?

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.437
Yep.

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:10.044
So are we never
gonna talk again?

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:13.148
What do you wanna
talk about, Dani?

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:16.084
How you tryin' to be brand
new came between us?

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:19.988
Actually, that chick on your
arm is what came in between us.

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:23.224
You said you came to A&T to
get away from all of this.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:25.560
This anger.

01:09:25.627 --> 01:09:27.595
This image.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:29.462
But you're slippin'
right back in, Jay.

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:36.270
Y'all done?

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:38.673
Yeah.

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:40.375
We're done.

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:06.267
Hey.

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:07.569
Hey.

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:09.537
You okay?

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:13.808
Um, I'm fine.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.009
You know what?

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.811
I'm gonna go talk to his
passive aggressive ass.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.012
You said you were sorry.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.180
No.

01:10:19.248 --> 01:10:20.682
I'm just letting it go.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.820
Hey.

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:26.988
Hey.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.890
I see you're here feeling
charitable too, huh?

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:32.427
Yeah, you know Alpha Beta's
all about community service.

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:33.928
Yeah.

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:34.696
Oh, sorry.

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:36.664
This is my girl Dani.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:38.066
Hi.

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:39.467
 Want a lot of things
that I couldn't have 

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:42.337
 I've done a lot of things
that I shouldn't have 

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.006
And uh, this is my girl Cree.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:48.109
Hi.

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:50.111
I'll see y'all around, okay?

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:57.652
Maybe he's just...

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.255
I know what he is.

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:02.757
I was just hopin'
that he wasn't.

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:03.625
Leon.

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:04.692
I gotta go.

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:17.872
Tyree.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.107
I'll catch you later, bro.

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:21.943
Yeah man.

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.645
Tyree, come on.

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:26.347
I can handle everyone
else being mad at me.

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:29.484
I know I messed up at
the Southern State game.

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:30.752
Can we truce this?

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:32.320
Please?

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:35.456
I need you to help me
get back on the field.

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:37.025
Damn.

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:38.993
Them boys were right about you.

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.728
You got bigger balls than me.

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:45.133
What kind of misogynist
B.S. is that?

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.401
Listen, Dani.

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:49.037
I don't care what Armondi
and them think they did.

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:50.805
You didn't make P1 that night.

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:53.274
The call was fair, and I
know because it was mine.

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:54.609
But I deserve...

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:55.677
But you don't get it.

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:01.349
You don't just deserve to
be out on that field.

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:03.518
I mean we all feel
like we deserve it,

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:05.086
but the difference is,
we aint all used to

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.521
getting everything handed to us.

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:09.057
I have to believe
that I belong here.

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.591
Well maybe you don't.

01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:15.029
Maybe your dad was right,
you should go to Spellman.

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:16.737
There aint nothing for you here.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.928
And that aint just
me talkin' neither.

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:41.422
Spellman?

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:42.990
Girl, Tyree is family.

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.359
He was just trippin'.

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:46.394
No, he's right.

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:49.564
I messed things up so badly,
and I can't fix them,

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.532
so I should just go.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.869
Have you talked to Jay?

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:57.739
My Pops is gonna be here soon.

01:12:57.806 --> 01:12:59.941
I got so much more to pack, so.

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.255
All right.
All right.

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:15.490
You guys better get to practice

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:17.792
because I still want
a Panther victory.

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:38.980
Since day one we've
talked about identity.

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:40.281
I wanted you to know
where you came from,

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:44.085
but I also wanted you to
discover who you are.

01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:47.388
Now in New Orleans,
my band, we had Jazz.

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:51.025
It was the sound of thriving
in the face of defeat.

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.494
But what's our sound?

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.663
Who are the Marching Panthers?

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:58.399
Maybe we aint tryin'
to have a sound.

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:00.134
We just tryin' to
win the trophy.

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:01.569
Mr. Mason, there's
a whole...

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:04.439
Got a whole lot of mouth.

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:08.409
Sean, let me holla
at him real quick.

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:10.237
Y'all suppose to be
the Senate right?

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:14.148
You know it.

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:20.087
Section leader, where you at?

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:23.825
Sup?

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:28.529
Meet me on the field
in five minutes.

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.531
All right, lets do this.

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:31.766
Lets see if you can
keep up, youngin's.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:35.403
If you can.

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:01.929
Hey, my bad.

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.831
They're pretty good.

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:06.033
Kind of reminds me of
us back in the day.

01:15:06.101 --> 01:15:07.368
Of course, they aint as
pretty as we were.

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:08.269
Na, na, na.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.657
Never that.
Never that.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:11.305
Man, how long it's been
since we've played together?

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:12.840
12 years.

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:14.275
Think you still got it?

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:15.109
We'll see.

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:16.177
Lets do this.

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:57.485
Damn!

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:00.821
Yeah.

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:02.290
We still do that.

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:03.624
One band...

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.026
One sound.

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:07.728
We know each other because we're
a team until the day we die.

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:08.963
Yeah.

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:11.632
I mean, there's a lot
of talent in this band.

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.068
Talent, aint get me
to where I am today.

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:17.872
Work ethic, drive, team work.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.441
I learned all of
that right here.

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:22.109
Until y'all learn
that, you aint gonna

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:24.211
get no where near a trophy.

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:28.749
So, stop bitching
and be about it.

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:36.817
Truth.

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:43.264
One.

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:44.198
Two.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.800
One, two, three.

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:00.948
They got a business program.

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:04.051
Not only will you learn
how to be in a drum line,

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:05.920
you'll learn to own
your own line of drums.

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:07.755
Monetize that which you love.

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:14.228
That way, our baby can
call the shots herself.

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:18.833
Dani, sometimes the
fun path for today

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.334
is not the right
path for tomorrow,

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:23.104
and it takes a lot of
courage to recognize that.

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:27.642
And I am so glad we raised
a daughter with courage.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:29.543
That's more than I had.

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:31.379
This is not about your
vegan cake business...

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:33.014
It was a pastry company, honey.

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.401
Those cakes tasted
terrible, baby.

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:35.750
And I only quit
because you wanted me

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:37.097
to follow you to medical school.

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:37.985
And look at where we are.

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:39.086
And I resented it.

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:50.631
I can't go.

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:52.633
Danielle.

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:54.821
I needed to prove to you
guys that I could do this,

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:58.606
but the truth is, I had to
prove this to myself too.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:17:59.874
And you did.

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:03.611
But I can't run just
because it got hard.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.380
Spellman would be easier.

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:09.183
You guys would make it easier.

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.851
But then I wouldn't know
what it's like to work

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:12.720
hard for something on my own.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.861
Is that what you want?

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:25.032
Yeah.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.401
All right.

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:28.909
I guess I'm unpacking the car.

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:42.950
Sorry I'm late.

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:44.752
Don't mind that letter
I left on your desk.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.887
What letter?

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:48.122
Strap up, Miss Raymond.

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:53.194
Join your section.

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:54.729
Tyree.

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:56.030
I thought you quit.

01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:58.265
I almost did, but
then I remembered

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.101
that membership is an honor.

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:01.635
Marching is a privilege.

01:19:01.703 --> 01:19:03.404
We value to uphold
that privilege

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:06.107
with honor and excellence.

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.708
We acknowledge our past and...

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:10.344
Stop.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:13.647
You know I say some dumb
things sometimes, cuz.

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:15.082
Must run in the family.

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.224
From the top.

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.025
One, two, three.

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:37.471
So, you're going to
keep your job?

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:38.539
Yeah.

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.293
I got used to making
my own money.

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:45.179
Guess who got a C on this test?

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:47.882
Oh my God, you failed.

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:48.849
No.

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:50.651
A C is a pass, Tasha.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.386
It's enough for me to march
with y'all at the Classic.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:52.953
What?

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:54.021
Yeah.

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:59.426
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:00.494
Yes!

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:01.562
Oh yes.

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:09.103
I'm his tutor.

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:10.437
Tutor.

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:12.206
You never even crack a book.

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:15.776
That's because I'm a
minister scholar.

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.812
I'm a straight up nerd.

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:19.246
I just don't like
to talk about it,

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:20.681
cause the dudes I
like to kick it with

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.883
don't like girls
with big brains.

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:25.286
They like big asses.

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:27.154
Then you are kickin' it
with the wrong dudes.

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:28.455
You need to give me a shot.

01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:30.758
JFK, I done told you...

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:32.226
What is it?

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:33.027
Huh?

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.895
Is it cause I'm white?

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:36.230
I've dated white dudes.

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:38.299
It's cause you're corny.

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:40.000
Tasha, he's not that bad.

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.403
Oh, then you go out with him.

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.205
Look, I'm just
gonna keep asking,

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:46.106
and I can be super
corny when I'm trying

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:48.342
to get my mac on a
fine ass honey,

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:51.212
such as your self.

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:52.813
Oh, Lord, help me.

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:54.815
Come on.

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:59.086
What can it hurt?

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:01.021
Please?

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:01.822
Okay.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:02.890
One date.

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.634
I am one piece of a whole.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:16.770
All hands at my
house, on my tempo.

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:30.217
Now that was old school A&T.

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:31.318
That was heart.

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.553
A&T's in your blood now.

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:33.988
I can feel it.

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:37.157
Now, I know many of you
might think my ego's

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:39.159
as big as some of y'alls.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:40.427
It's okay.

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:42.630
We all let ego get in
the way sometimes.

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:44.932
What I just heard on
this field right here,

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.701
that is the result of
your hard work.

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:51.538
Now, one more thing before
practice is dismissed,

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:55.576
two P4's have earned their
way back on to the field.

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:58.612
Mr. LaPierre, Miss Raymond,

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.514
you will march in the Classic.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.217
There's still the issue of the
one spot left on the Senate.

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:04.551
Mr. Raymond?

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.520
I believe they both
deserve a shot.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.355
Your section, your call.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:09.757
All right, you'll both compete

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:10.858
for the spot after practice.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.427
Jayven can have the spot.

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:15.663
He earned it fair and square.

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:18.399
I know I'll get my shot.

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:20.634
Then it's settled.

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:21.769
One band...

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:23.270
One sound.

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:24.438
Dismissed.

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:35.416
Leon.

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:38.953
Look, about Cree.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.722
Come on, you know how
that is, right?

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.457
I'm not like you, man.

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:45.192
All out with mine?

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:48.595
I can't have everybody
up in my business.

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:49.630
I promised myself I would never

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:53.367
go back into that
closet for nobody.

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.169
And it sucks cause
I really like you.

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:00.607
I gotta go.

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:01.675
Leon.

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.485
You started runnin' at night?

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:12.553
You should have a stick,

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:16.090
or some pepper
spray, or something.

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:18.892
Nia, I'm sorry.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.227
No matter what I do,

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:21.228
you're gonna hold me to
what I did a long time ago.

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:22.629
And I get it.

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:23.464
I married your brother.

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.531
How?

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:26.633
How'd you let that happen?

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.261
We bonded over being mad at you,

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:34.808
and I mistook it for
a deeper connection.

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:37.116
But I remember that look on
your face when I said I do

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:40.748
and I know that's why you
took that job in New Orleans.

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:43.317
You're angry.

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:48.922
And I don't know if
you can get over it.

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:52.393
Good luck at the Classic.

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.161
And I have pepper spray.

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:09.143
Jayven.

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:10.711
Tomorrow's the Classic.

01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:22.256
Why are you doing this?

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:25.359
Someone sold pictures of
my Dad buying drugs.

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:27.995
Now there's proof.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:30.998
It'll be in the
tabloids tomorrow.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:34.935
Everyone's gonna see the truth.

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.937
I'm sorry, but that
is not your truth.

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:44.445
You said you wanted
something for yourself.

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:46.480
Well tomorrow is your chance
to prove to the world

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:50.017
who the real Jayven LaPierre is.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:52.252
Unless you're scared.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.355
Of what?

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:57.724
Maybe you don't
really know yourself.

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:12.906
Wassup ATL?

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.274
It is the 5th quarter.

01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:17.411
We are at the Southern
Jamboree Classic,

01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:19.213
here on the campus of A&T.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.814
It is going down.

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:21.715
The turn up is real.

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.303
Oh yeah, special guest host,

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:25.252
Mr. Devon Miles
in the building.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.088
I'm gonna let the
applause die down first.

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:30.090
Let me tell you, it is
an honor to be here, man.

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.425
You know, but it's
not about me today.

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:34.495
Honestly, it is all
about the band.

01:25:34.562 --> 01:25:37.898
They comin' from all over
the Southeast to get it in.

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:40.634
And I hear, as usual,

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:43.103
Southern State is
the band to beat.

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:44.505
Dude, we beefin' already?

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:45.439
I'm just sayin' what I heard.

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:46.140
Come on, man.

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:47.608
You know I'm A&T all day.

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:48.976
Quit playin.

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:50.077
All right, we're gonna see
what you're gonna do though.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:51.278
Disrespect my section.

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:56.517
Leon, you seen Jayven?

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:58.318
He wasn't in the
room this morning.

01:25:58.386 --> 01:26:02.289
Give it up for the Marching
Bayou Tech, Glory.

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:15.629
 I was paralyzed by
those pair of lies 

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:23.377
 but those pair of eyes brought
me right back, back, back 

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:30.484
 to you I gave up my
pride for you 

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:38.552
 by my side I just want
you however I can 

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:47.067
You're right, I was
still angry at you.

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:49.036
I know.

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:52.839
But I would rather be
with you in the present

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:54.608
then mad at you about the past.

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:03.984
That was real
smooth, Dr. Taylor.

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:05.118
Oh, I know.

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:19.933
Now lets go kick some butt.

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:21.268
Lets.

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:38.552
No, no, no, no, no.

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.860
You're missing the down beat
on the opening cadence.

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:49.029
Don't play on my drum.

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:50.697
I got this.

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.733
Didn't sound like it.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.201
Yo, you need to check
your cousin, Ty.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:56.470
Uh, no one needs to check me.

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:58.538
Yo, I'm just glad your
ass is behind me.

01:27:58.606 --> 01:27:59.406
Where it belongs.

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:04.544
Hey man, ease up.

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:07.547
I thought you bailed.

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:09.883
Not when I have
something to prove.

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:16.423
Awe.

01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:17.491
What?

01:28:17.525 --> 01:28:18.925
You hittin' that again?

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.829
You must be smokin',
like your Pops.

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:24.731
Mondie, squash it.

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:27.467
Hey you know what,
I got this, Ty.

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.403
Lets go, right here, right now.

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:31.204
Head to head, you and me.

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:32.873
You up for the challenge?

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.008
Cause if I get your
spot, I'm keepin' it.

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:52.359
Man, get out of
here with all that.

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:54.027
Then I guess it's squashed.

01:28:57.598 --> 01:29:01.234
Give me my sticks.

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:13.280
Baby brother, I hope you got
your band together this time.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.682
I guess you'll find
out on the field.

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.884
Indeed we will.

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:21.822
Sup, Nia?

01:29:21.889 --> 01:29:24.057
Oh I see, we're having
ourselves a little,

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:25.525
little reunion, huh?

01:29:25.593 --> 01:29:29.296
You know, I knew this was why
you really came back here.

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:30.831
Good luck, Kevin.

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:35.302
Luck is when opportunity
meets preparation.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:38.372
Plus, I always win.

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:40.207
Aint that right, Nia?

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:49.649
And now that the sun has set.

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:52.152
Ladies and gentleman,
coming to the field,

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.355
under the direction
of Dr. Kevin Taylor.

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:57.657
The reigning Southern Jamboree

01:29:57.725 --> 01:30:01.428
Classic Champions,
Southern State.

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:03.764
Boo.

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:15.442
SSU.

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.215
Boom!

01:32:38.185 --> 01:32:39.286
All right.

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:41.187
That was all right.

01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:42.889
I'm not mad at that at all.

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:46.459
All right, come on A&T,
this is your moment.

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:49.129
And here they are,
on their home turf.

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:54.367
The one, the only, A&T Marching
Panthers, directed by...

01:32:54.435 --> 01:32:55.702
Hey, let me do the honors.

01:32:55.770 --> 01:33:00.507
Directed by my friend,
Dr. Sean Taylor.

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:21.061
Are we watching this entrance,
ladies and gentleman?

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:22.262
Is this how we feel?

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:24.097
It's working.
It's working.

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:45.679
A&T is turnt up.

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:46.846
Hey, it's real out there.

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:41.701
It's a little different.

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:13.366
A&T is back!

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:15.935
The Panthers came to battle!

01:36:16.003 --> 01:36:17.036
I see what y'all doing.

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:24.444
Not very traditional,
it's different.

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:27.347
Whatever the
outcome, it's gonna be close.

01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:28.581
They brought it today.

01:36:28.649 --> 01:36:29.783
Absolutely

01:36:37.658 --> 01:36:39.192
Oh, Lordy.

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.293
I don't know y'all.

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:47.066
And here it comes!

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:51.805
The winner of the
7th Jamboree Classic

01:36:51.872 --> 01:36:57.610
and $75,000 cash, for the
first time in 6 years.

01:36:57.678 --> 01:37:02.215
Atlanta A & T Marching Panthers.

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:10.423
That's what I'm
talking about, baby!

01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:12.192
I knew we had it.

01:37:12.259 --> 01:37:13.493
Didn't I say we had it?

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:14.561
I was right.

01:37:17.565 --> 01:37:19.599
Oh, wait, wait a minute.

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:21.601
Southern State
Drumline is calling

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:24.170
for a Drumline Challenge.

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:25.138
Looks like we've got ourselves

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:26.686
a little sore loser challenge.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.342
I say we go out there
and we spank 'em.

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:30.877
You already won.

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:31.945
You've got nothing
else to prove.

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:34.247
We know that.

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:36.475
But we think Southern State
needs a little lesson.

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:39.052
M hmmm.

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:41.287
So say you all?

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:45.491
: A&T, A&T

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:50.830
Then, spank 'em.

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:52.131
Yeah baby.

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:53.833
Dr. Taylor.

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:54.934
I have an idea.

01:37:57.705 --> 01:38:00.573
Wait a minute, I've
never seen this before.

01:38:00.641 --> 01:38:03.076
I've never seen this before.

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:05.912
That's what we do, ok?

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.814
As you know a lot of folks say,

01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:10.650
Drumline is where you
actually find a champion.

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.585
Well, we're going to
find out today.

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:23.596
We got this.

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:44.150
Get some.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.255
Get 'em

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:06.973
Southern State.

01:39:07.041 --> 01:39:07.707
Wow!

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:08.808
Come on A&T.

01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:32.332
Woohoo,

01:39:32.399 --> 01:39:33.900
The Senate is here to battle!

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:02.228
Yeah, D!

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:05.264
A&T's drumline
is still killing it.

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:45.204
Woah, woah, wait a minute.

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:46.305
Whooo.

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:48.474
The panthers are on
the prowl tonight!

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:50.502
Are you watching this,
ladies and gentlemen?

01:41:36.423 --> 01:41:37.943
That's what I'm talking about!

01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:43.729
Shoutout to A&T
ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:45.198
Victorious.

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:54.607
Can alumni be proud right now?

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:56.242
Be proud.

01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:58.744
You should be.

01:41:58.812 --> 01:42:00.580
Hey, yo, A&T is back.

01:42:07.354 --> 01:42:09.122
Not bad section leader.

01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:10.223
Not bad at all.

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:12.191
Thank you so much,
Dr. Taylor.

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:13.459
Congratulations.

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:15.194
Thanks you, Dr. Taylor

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:17.497
: A&T

01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:20.633
I knew you were the only one
that could turn this around.

01:42:20.701 --> 01:42:23.603
Oh, girl, I'm just
getting started.

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:27.273
And I'm not talking
about the band.

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:28.508
You ok, Dr. Taylor?

01:42:35.916 --> 01:42:40.486
Hey, you were pretty
nice on that snare.

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:42.054
You too, Mr. LaPierre.

01:42:42.122 --> 01:42:45.958
Nah, just Javon.

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:48.161
Ok, Javon.

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:52.398
So you gonna stand there or you
gonna cut to the good part?

01:43:02.676 --> 01:43:10.676
: A&T,
A&T, A&T, A&T
