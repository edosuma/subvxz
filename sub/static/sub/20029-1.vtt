01:12.038 --> 01:14.373
Go to sleep.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.974
I'm not tired.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.644
All right.

01:20.046 --> 01:22.581
Let's make up a story.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.683
Shall I start?
Yes.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.389
Once upon a time
there was a village,

01:30.391 --> 01:31.990
abandoned
by its inhabitants...

01:34.627 --> 01:36.261
Even the rats left.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.198
Even the rats left.

01:39.200 --> 01:43.168
The village stood silent
and abandoned, year after year.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.438
<i> Rain pounded the streets,</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:50.075
<i> washing away any human trace.</i>

01:50.077 --> 01:55.581
<i> When the rats cleared,</i>
<i>birds swarmed over the village.</i>

01:55.583 --> 02:00.219
<i> There were so many, they</i>
<i> almost blocked out the sky.</i>

02:00.221 --> 02:02.621
<i> It was night, all day long.</i>

02:04.057 --> 02:07.459
<i> But then,</i>
<i> from one small house...</i>

02:07.461 --> 02:10.762
<i> A little boy opened the door.</i>

02:10.764 --> 02:15.134
<i> He was the only one</i>
<i> left behind.</i>

02:31.284 --> 02:34.820
<i>My mother was 38 when she died.</i>

02:37.257 --> 02:41.426
<i> At my age today,</i>
<i> I could be her father.</i>

02:43.263 --> 02:46.265
<i> Many things have happened</i>
<i> in Jerusalem.</i>

02:46.267 --> 02:49.134
<i> The city was</i>
<i> destroyed, rebuilt,</i>

02:49.136 --> 02:51.837
<i> destroyed and rebuilt again.</i>

02:51.839 --> 02:55.641
<i> Conqueror after conqueror</i>
<i> came, ruled for a while,</i>

02:55.643 --> 02:58.610
<i> left behind some walls,</i>
<i> some towers,</i>

02:58.612 --> 03:01.146
<i> some cracks in the stones,</i>

03:01.148 --> 03:02.781
<i> and then disappeared,</i>

03:02.783 --> 03:05.851
<i> like the morning mist</i>
<i> down the hillslopes.</i>

03:07.453 --> 03:11.623
<i> Jerusalem's a black widow,</i>

03:11.625 --> 03:14.860
<i> who devours her lovers while</i>
<i> they are still inside her.</i>

03:21.301 --> 03:24.203
We're late.
The boy, arieh.

03:33.479 --> 03:37.149
<i> My mother grew up</i>
<i> in the town of rovno,</i>

03:37.151 --> 03:40.319
<i> which was then in Poland,</i>
<i> and is now in Ukraine.</i>

03:42.155 --> 03:45.557
<i> Her childhood there</i>
<i> was made up of words like...</i>

03:45.559 --> 03:48.827
<i> Chandeliers, servants,</i>

03:48.829 --> 03:51.563
<i> mystery,</i>

03:51.565 --> 03:53.899
<i> romantic melancholy...</i>

03:58.204 --> 04:00.906
<i> As anti-semitism spread</i>
<i> through Europe...</i>

04:02.408 --> 04:04.910
<i> My mother</i>
<i> dreamed of Israel...</i>

04:06.546 --> 04:09.181
<i> As the land</i>
<i> of milk and honey,</i>

04:09.183 --> 04:11.316
<i> where pioneers</i>
<i> made the desert bloom...</i>

04:17.390 --> 04:22.461
<i> She imagined the pioneer as</i>
<i> a poet, worker, revolutionary,</i>

04:22.463 --> 04:26.565
<i> born for fields</i>
<i> and battlefields alike,</i>

04:26.567 --> 04:32.204
<i> but also emotional</i>
<i> and intellectual.</i>

04:35.408 --> 04:39.578
<i> After my mother</i>
<i> and her family fled Europe,</i>

04:39.580 --> 04:42.214
<i> back in Poland's</i>
<i> sosenki forest,</i>

04:42.216 --> 04:44.449
<i> where my mother</i>
<i> and her sisters</i>

04:44.451 --> 04:47.719
<i> once loved to pick</i>
<i> mushrooms and berries,</i>

04:47.721 --> 04:49.821
<i> and sleep</i>
<i> in sleeping bags</i>

04:49.823 --> 04:51.957
<i> on the riverbank</i>
<i> beneath the stars.</i>

04:54.627 --> 04:57.396
<i> Germans, Lithuanians,</i>
<i> and Ukrainians,</i>

04:57.398 --> 04:58.930
<i> opened fire</i>
<i> with machine guns,</i>

04:58.932 --> 05:03.468
<i> and killed 23,000 Jews</i>
<i> in two days.</i>

05:07.807 --> 05:11.677
<i> They killed almost everyone</i>
<i> my mother had ever known.</i>

05:21.454 --> 05:22.921
A million kiddies...

05:24.257 --> 05:26.491
A million kiddies...

05:26.493 --> 05:29.561
They killed a million kids
like you!

05:32.432 --> 05:35.701
Jerusalem, 1945,
under the British mandate

05:39.272 --> 05:42.307
good day, ma'am.
May I please have Tel Aviv 648?

05:42.309 --> 05:45.277
<i> Please wait a minute, sir.</i>

05:45.279 --> 05:47.379
<i> Mr. nashashibi is on the way.</i>

05:47.381 --> 05:49.715
Of course I'll wait,
but people are waiting

05:49.717 --> 05:51.316
on the other end too.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.851
It's too early, arieh.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.653
It will take time
to get a connection.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.288
What if they connect us
right way,

05:56.290 --> 05:57.756
and nobody is there yet?

05:58.825 --> 06:00.525
Hello? Tsvi?

06:02.495 --> 06:05.464
<i> Speaking. </i>
It's arieh, from Jerusalem.

06:05.466 --> 06:08.300
<i> Yes, arieh. Hello.</i>
<i> This is tsvi. How are you?</i>

06:08.302 --> 06:10.001
Everything is fine here.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.738
We're calling
from the pharmacy.
Ask my sister how she is.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.474
<i> How's it going in Tel Aviv?</i>

06:15.476 --> 06:17.743
Everything's fine.
Nothing special.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.411
Life.

06:19.413 --> 06:22.981
No news is good news.
There's no news here either.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.685
<i> We'll write and set a time</i>
<i> for the next call.</i>

06:26.687 --> 06:28.487
<i> Take care of yourselves.</i>

06:28.489 --> 06:29.921
<i> Be well. </i>
You too.

06:32.325 --> 06:37.062
<i> They weren't actually sure</i>
<i> if they'd talk again or not.</i>

06:37.064 --> 06:40.332
<i> There could be riots,</i>
<i> or a pogrom.</i>

06:40.334 --> 06:42.334
<i> The British could betray us.</i>

06:44.036 --> 06:46.071
The curfew will start soon.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.349
Hello.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.084
Good evening.
Good evening.

07:01.687 --> 07:04.523
<i> Close the windows!</i>
<i> Close the doors, please.</i>

07:08.861 --> 07:10.929
They're all gone now.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.766
It's like rovno
was just a dream.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.813
It's here.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.821
A new book,
hot off the press.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.758
My first book.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.429
The novella
in Hebrew literature.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.931
It's like having a new baby.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.741
I'll invite your parents.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.548
"To my brother
and teacher, David,

08:36.549 --> 08:38.450
whom I lost
in the darkness."

09:14.854 --> 09:17.155
Who said your uncle
would be

09:17.157 --> 09:19.491
the only important
academic in the family?

09:19.493 --> 09:22.994
Well, it's only
my first publication.

09:22.996 --> 09:27.699
And not the last.

09:27.701 --> 09:31.236
The borscht is good.
Not bad...

09:31.238 --> 09:33.505
Almost tasty.

09:33.507 --> 09:36.508
But even gentile servants
in Jewish homes

09:36.510 --> 09:40.579
knew that borscht should be
sour and just slightly sweet--

09:40.581 --> 09:43.682
never sweet and slightly sour.

09:43.684 --> 09:48.853
Like the poles who always add
sugar, with no rhyme or reason.

09:48.855 --> 09:52.924
They even ruin horseradish
by adding jam to it.

09:54.627 --> 09:58.730
Let's raise a toast
in honor of the new book.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.131
Lehayim.
Congratulations.

10:13.079 --> 10:17.882
If you have to choose
between telling a lie
or insulting someone,

10:17.884 --> 10:18.984
choose to be generous.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.123
I'm allowed to lie?

10:27.593 --> 10:29.561
Sometimes... yes.

10:31.063 --> 10:34.733
It's better to be sensitive
than to be honest.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.322
Come, hold the peg.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.959
We'll make
our own little kibbutz,

11:00.961 --> 11:03.995
and by our own efforts, "bring
forth bread from the earth."

11:03.997 --> 11:05.163
Forward!

11:07.333 --> 11:12.337
You know, the word
"kadima" means forward.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.106
But...

11:16.976 --> 11:21.112
The word actually derives
from the word "kedem,"

11:21.114 --> 11:23.782
which refers to
"ancient times." Ahh!

11:23.784 --> 11:26.651
Ah!

11:26.653 --> 11:31.122
So the Hebrew speaker actually
looks forward to the past.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.625
Interesting, isn't it?
Yes.

11:33.627 --> 11:36.161
Are you hurt?

11:36.163 --> 11:38.730
Arieh?

11:38.732 --> 11:41.366
Can you recognize me
under all this sweat?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.034
Watch this.

11:44.136 --> 11:45.737
Ha!

11:59.819 --> 12:02.387
That's it!

12:07.860 --> 12:10.028
<i> My father once told me,</i>

12:10.030 --> 12:13.998
<i> "Amos, consider</i>
<i> the etymological link</i>
<i> between the words...</i>

12:14.000 --> 12:17.168
<i> Earth, man,</i>

12:17.170 --> 12:22.240
<i> blood, red, silence."</i>

12:32.051 --> 12:35.720
You write a new novel
every six months,

12:35.722 --> 12:38.957
and right away, all the pretty
girls grab you off the shelf

12:38.959 --> 12:41.259
and take you
straight to bed.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.695
At least my books
have some fun.

12:43.697 --> 12:46.030
If you're trying to get girls,

12:46.032 --> 12:48.767
maybe you should write
romance novels.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.816
All I'm saying is,
don't rush.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.417
Ask your sisters.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.954
Your life is only your own
for a very short time--

13:09.956 --> 13:12.323
from the time you leave home
to your first pregnancy.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.759
Even when your child grows up,
you don't get your life back.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.961
You go from being a mother
to a grandmother.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.932
But everybody says
that children

13:20.934 --> 13:23.234
are the best thing
that can happen to you.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.070
Who's everybody?

13:26.072 --> 13:28.940
Remember what happened
to our neighbor?

13:28.942 --> 13:30.275
Ira?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.744
Steletsky's wife.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.779
Yes, the alcoholic husband,

13:34.781 --> 13:37.916
who ran
our father's flour mill.

13:42.421 --> 13:47.292
<i> He would bet on her</i>
<i> at cards, and lose her,</i>

13:47.294 --> 13:49.928
<i> each time for one night,</i>

13:49.930 --> 13:53.765
<i> until finally she left him</i>
<i> for the coachman's son.</i>

13:53.767 --> 13:56.367
Anton!

13:56.369 --> 13:58.469
<i> From this hut...</i>

13:58.471 --> 14:01.506
<i> She could see her children</i>
<i> playing in the distance.</i>

14:04.276 --> 14:07.846
<i> Then one day, she decided</i>
<i> to go see her daughter.</i>

14:15.988 --> 14:18.056
<i> As she approached,</i>

14:18.058 --> 14:19.490
<i> her daughter</i>
<i> called her a whore...</i>

14:19.492 --> 14:21.893
<i> And refused to speak to her.</i>

14:21.895 --> 14:24.262
Kira!

14:27.132 --> 14:32.203
<i> That night, ira gathered</i>
<i>whatever strength she had left,</i>

14:32.205 --> 14:35.473
<i> went into the little hut</i>
<i> with a can of petrol...</i>

14:41.547 --> 14:43.381
<i> And lit a match.</i>

15:10.910 --> 15:14.212
Our children don't realize
how much they can hurt us.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.847
I just can't
understand why...

15:15.849 --> 15:17.849
Why no one warned you?

15:17.851 --> 15:20.084
What did you expect?
A warning in fine print?

15:20.086 --> 15:23.955
That you're only food?

15:23.957 --> 15:26.591
That you're what the chick
eats to grow strong?

15:28.394 --> 15:30.862
No one warns us,

15:30.864 --> 15:35.066
because every mother
thinks she's the only one
who feels that way--

15:35.068 --> 15:38.569
and every mother cries
into her pillow, alone at night.

15:38.571 --> 15:42.206
Except for our mother,
who just curses us.

15:47.613 --> 15:51.115
"Tarzan the invincible"

16:06.065 --> 16:09.400
stay out of trouble.
Just be a good boy, okay?

16:09.402 --> 16:10.468
Okay.

16:12.338 --> 16:16.908
<i>My parents' friends,</i>
<i> staszek and mala rudnicki,</i>

16:16.910 --> 16:19.344
<i> had no children of their own,</i>

16:19.346 --> 16:23.414
<i> so sometimes my parents</i>
<i> would let them borrow me.</i>

16:23.416 --> 16:25.483
<i> My father said</i>

16:25.485 --> 16:29.654
<i> that the Hebrew word</i>
<i> for childlessness</i>

16:29.656 --> 16:33.358
<i> is related</i>
<i> to the word for darkness,</i>

16:33.360 --> 16:37.261
<i> and that the word for darkness</i>
<i> is related to forgetting.</i>

16:38.263 --> 16:40.999
<i> Lack of memory.</i>

16:41.001 --> 16:44.002
<i> Lack of children.</i>

16:44.004 --> 16:46.104
<i> Lack of light.</i>

16:48.107 --> 16:51.542
<i> My mother would</i>
<i> go off on her own.</i>

16:51.544 --> 16:56.047
<i> To where,</i>
<i> I could only imagine.</i>

16:56.049 --> 16:58.950
When visiting an arab home,

16:58.952 --> 17:01.119
it's especially important
to remember your manners.

17:01.121 --> 17:06.457
Children are expected to stay
out of adult conversations.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.960
Only if spoken to directly,

17:08.962 --> 17:12.463
may you answer briefly
and very politely.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.531
If refreshments are served,

17:14.534 --> 17:18.069
don't choose something that
might make crumbs or grip.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.038
If they still insist
you have something,

17:20.040 --> 17:22.973
just refuse, but delicately,
like a gentleman--

17:22.976 --> 17:26.711
even if you can't resist
the sight of sweets.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.980
We were only invited
because your uncle staszek

17:28.982 --> 17:30.581
took care
of al-halwani's son.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.718
If, on this occasion,
in such tense times,

17:33.720 --> 17:38.189
we behave like animals,
not only will it be
sheer insolence,

17:38.191 --> 17:42.326
it could cause enormous
damage to the future
of our two peoples.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.438
Jacket? Jacket?

18:30.442 --> 18:36.047
Ah! Ah, my friend,
come, come, come.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.548
Welcome, welcome,
welcome.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.284
Pleased to meet you,
madam.
Hello.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.321
Please, everybody, I would
like you to meet my friend,

18:43.323 --> 18:45.223
the great Mr. stav.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.059
Mr. stav helped to clear
my son Edward,

18:48.061 --> 18:51.062
from that unfortunate incident
at the beginning of the summer.

18:51.064 --> 18:54.499
Thank you for coming.
Please, come here.

18:54.501 --> 18:59.470
Maybe the youngster
would like to go and
play in the garden?

19:01.607 --> 19:04.408
Please.
Please, madam.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.477
I want to show you...

19:42.781 --> 19:45.082
Good morning, miss.

19:46.652 --> 19:50.688
My name is Amos. And you?

19:52.457 --> 19:54.292
My name is Aisha.

19:55.861 --> 19:59.297
This is my brother, awwad.

20:00.732 --> 20:02.400
Your father...

20:02.402 --> 20:04.635
Your honored father
suggested...

20:04.637 --> 20:06.704
That I come here
to play with you.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.207
He's not my father.
He's my mother's uncle.

20:09.209 --> 20:12.243
I don't live here.
I live in talbieh.

20:12.245 --> 20:15.213
How do you
know Hebrew?

20:15.215 --> 20:18.516
I've been studying piano
in rehavia for three years now.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.752
It's a beautiful language,
and rehavia is beautiful too,

20:21.754 --> 20:23.888
so well-kept and quiet.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.793
Talbieh is also
well-kept and quiet.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.166
Would you mind if
we talked for a bit?

20:35.168 --> 20:37.802
Aren't we talking
already?

20:50.749 --> 20:54.185
There's enough room in
this country for both peoples.

20:54.187 --> 20:58.522
We just need to learn
to live together in peace
and mutual respect.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.395
I have a big brother
in London.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.764
He's studying
to be a lawyer.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.935
What do you want to study
when you grow up?

21:12.204 --> 21:15.273
What about you?

21:15.275 --> 21:19.210
You'll be a lawyer too,
based on how you speak.

21:19.212 --> 21:21.912
What makes you think that?

21:21.914 --> 21:24.315
I'm going to write a book.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.584
Really?
What kind of book?

21:26.586 --> 21:28.586
Poems.

21:28.588 --> 21:33.591
Poems?
Yes. In French
and English.

21:33.593 --> 21:38.462
I also write in arabic, but
i never show it to anyone.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.967
Is there
nice Hebrew poetry?

21:42.969 --> 21:46.237
Of course!
Levin kipnis, Rachel.

21:46.239 --> 21:50.574
Vladimir jabotinsky,
tcheminchowsky...

21:50.576 --> 21:53.344
"A generation of gods
walks the land...

21:54.479 --> 21:57.615
"A generation
drunk on life!

21:57.617 --> 22:00.418
"Estranged from
a sick people.

22:00.420 --> 22:03.421
And the tribe of sufferers."

22:10.262 --> 22:12.596
Can you also climb trees?

22:21.273 --> 22:23.607
Rest a minute,

22:23.609 --> 22:26.444
just a minute.

22:26.446 --> 22:29.280
Rest a minute,

22:29.282 --> 22:30.715
just a minute.

24:07.813 --> 24:11.782
This is the father of Amos.
May I please speak
with Mr. al-halwani?

24:13.885 --> 24:18.422
Well, could you please
tell him how very truly sorry
we are about what happened?

24:18.424 --> 24:21.392
We are anxious for
the health of the dear child.

24:21.394 --> 24:24.428
We'll pay any of the child's
medical expenses,
of course, in full.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.135
And we sincerely wish to effect
a meeting at an early date

24:31.137 --> 24:34.805
to clarify and try
to right the wrong.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.023
Once there were two monks...

24:53.025 --> 24:55.092
Who imposed all sorts of
restrictions on themselves.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.760
Among other things,

24:56.762 --> 25:02.166
they resolve to cross
all of India on foot.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.675
<i> They also took a vow</i>
<i> of complete silence.</i>

25:13.445 --> 25:15.679
<i> Even in their sleep,</i>
<i> they would not speak</i>

25:15.681 --> 25:20.017
<i> a single word throughout</i>
<i> their years of travel.</i>

25:20.019 --> 25:21.819
But once...

25:21.821 --> 25:24.555
While they were walking
along the bank of a river,

25:24.557 --> 25:27.791
they heard a drowning woman
crying for help.

25:37.469 --> 25:40.538
<i> Without a word, the younger</i>
<i> monk jumped into the water.</i>

25:43.875 --> 25:45.676
<i> He bore the woman</i>
<i> on his back</i>

25:45.678 --> 25:47.978
<i> and laid her on the ground.</i>

25:54.686 --> 25:58.656
<i> The two monks continued</i>
<i> their journey in silence.</i>

25:58.658 --> 26:00.524
Six months later,

26:00.526 --> 26:03.160
the younger monk
suddenly asked,

26:06.698 --> 26:08.899
"tell me...

26:11.202 --> 26:16.106
Do you think
i sinned when I carried
that woman on my back?"

26:16.108 --> 26:18.776
<i> His friend answered</i>
<i> with a question:</i>

26:18.778 --> 26:23.013
"What? Are you still
carrying her on your back?"

26:38.196 --> 26:44.201
Amos, when I was a student,
i loved to read here
among the flowers.

26:44.203 --> 26:48.272
And one day, after class,
she met your future father here.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.674
Do you remember what I told you
about the word "flower"?

26:52.277 --> 26:55.279
Flower is a combination of
the words "bull" and "scent."

26:55.281 --> 26:57.548
"Bull" has the same root
as "fertility,"

26:57.550 --> 27:01.885
and "scent" lures the insects
that fertilize the plant.

27:01.887 --> 27:05.055
He took advantage of
my weakness for words.

27:05.057 --> 27:08.225
What could I do? All
the boys were courting her!

27:08.227 --> 27:10.294
I had to make myself
stand out.

27:11.563 --> 27:12.896
That's what happened.

28:13.324 --> 28:18.128
<i> Remembering is like trying</i>
<i> to restore an old building</i>

28:18.130 --> 28:20.364
<i> with the stones</i>
<i> from its ruins.</i>

28:22.000 --> 28:24.368
<i> And the stones have memory.</i>

28:32.210 --> 28:35.646
May I please have some apc?

28:35.648 --> 28:37.815
I have a headache
that won't go away.

28:37.817 --> 28:41.318
I don't believe them.
I don't believe anyone anymore.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.921
It's a big conspiracy.

28:43.923 --> 28:47.658
What do you think?
That our boys will
fight for you,

28:47.660 --> 28:49.827
that they risk their
young lives for you,

28:49.829 --> 28:52.162
when you say
it's all a conspiracy?

28:52.164 --> 28:54.031
Yes, because it is
all one big conspiracy!

28:54.033 --> 28:55.833
It's like theater!

28:55.835 --> 28:59.670
Ben-gurion secretly
agreed to sell Jerusalem
to king Abdullah

28:59.672 --> 29:01.672
so that he can keep
his kibbutzim.

29:01.674 --> 29:04.341
They don't care if they
slaughter and burn us all.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.910
What's wrong with you?
How can you say that?

29:08.346 --> 29:10.848
A million kids...

29:10.850 --> 29:15.119
If there is a war--
when there is a war--
we will win.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.020
Our state is standing
right at the gate.

29:18.389 --> 29:21.125
It's not standing.
There is no gate.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.963
There is an abyss.
Not in front of the child.

29:32.203 --> 29:34.104
Mm.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.708
Nothing grew!

29:37.710 --> 29:39.943
Come here.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.787
You know...

29:49.789 --> 29:54.224
That if you open up
someone's head and
take out his brain...

29:55.994 --> 29:59.730
You see that our brains are
nothing but cauliflower--

29:59.732 --> 30:02.332
a cauliflower this size.

30:02.334 --> 30:06.737
What a miracle it is that
this small cauliflower

30:06.739 --> 30:10.174
can hold the sky
and the land,

30:10.176 --> 30:13.277
the sun and
all the stars.

30:13.279 --> 30:18.749
It can hold Plato's ideas,
and Beethoven's music,

30:18.751 --> 30:22.753
and Chekhov's plays,

30:22.755 --> 30:26.990
all the dinosaurs
and the whales...

30:29.828 --> 30:34.331
And the hopes
and the passions and
mistakes and fantasies...

30:35.767 --> 30:37.868
And that's it.

30:51.316 --> 30:53.450
Amos!

30:53.452 --> 30:55.385
Come play with us!

30:55.387 --> 30:58.422
I can't. My grandma
is coming today.

31:03.127 --> 31:05.262
Kids! What are you doing?

31:10.201 --> 31:12.803
You've abandoned me.

31:12.805 --> 31:15.806
I have no life here.

31:15.808 --> 31:19.376
You spit on me,
your own mother--

31:19.378 --> 31:24.081
the only person
who will take care of you!

31:25.083 --> 31:28.418
Just look at you.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.754
How can you stand it?

31:34.259 --> 31:36.426
This place is disgusting!

31:38.863 --> 31:42.499
Oh. I'm not good enough
for you to answer?

31:44.269 --> 31:47.404
I should have
left you in rovno!

31:47.406 --> 31:50.407
I would have been
better off!

32:17.302 --> 32:19.169
Fanitchka!

32:22.307 --> 32:24.007
Fania!

32:25.376 --> 32:28.111
Amos, where's your mother?

32:32.550 --> 32:35.953
Fania?

32:58.576 --> 33:01.411
You won't believe it!
My book is sold out!

33:01.413 --> 33:03.180
All five of them!

33:03.182 --> 33:05.649
He said he'd order more.
He already did, by phone.

33:05.651 --> 33:09.052
Five more! He says this
is just the beginning!

33:16.494 --> 33:19.663
Let's go to the Edison
and see a film.

33:24.435 --> 33:26.937
Zarchi will
watch you, okay?

33:26.939 --> 33:28.672
For us.

33:28.674 --> 33:33.510
<i> You can find hell</i>
<i> and paradise in every room.</i>

33:35.380 --> 33:40.384
<i> A little meanness,</i>
<i> and people are</i>
<i> hell to each other.</i>

33:40.386 --> 33:43.520
<i> A little compassion,</i>
<i> a little generosity,</i>

33:43.522 --> 33:46.623
<i> and people find</i>
<i> paradise in each other.</i>

33:46.625 --> 33:50.127
Congratulations again.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.562
I still can't believe it.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.197
Give my love to garbo.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.134
Amos, behave yourself.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.636
Want a book?

34:42.679 --> 34:45.014
Tchernichowsky.

35:28.259 --> 35:31.728
<i> It seems that your Patience</i>
<i> has helped our plants.</i>

35:31.730 --> 35:34.164
Why don't you go
see for yourself?

36:08.099 --> 36:12.802
When my family moved to
the house on dubinska street,

36:12.804 --> 36:16.373
we inherited some tenants
from the previous owners.

36:18.109 --> 36:22.379
A Polish officer named jan
lived in the front room.

36:22.381 --> 36:26.349
<i> Every Friday, my mother</i>
<i> would send one of us</i>

36:26.351 --> 36:30.620
<i> with a tray of hot biscuits,</i>
<i> straight from the oven,</i>

36:30.622 --> 36:33.557
<i> to wish him a good sabbath</i>
<i>on behalf of the entire family.</i>

36:33.559 --> 36:34.824
<i> Sabbat shalom.</i>

36:37.396 --> 36:40.397
<i> He would stroke my head...</i>

36:40.399 --> 36:42.499
Call me <i> cyganka,</i>

36:42.501 --> 36:44.868
a gypsy.

36:44.870 --> 36:48.572
<i> And promise he would</i>
<i> wait for me</i>

36:48.574 --> 36:51.441
<i> and marry me when I grew up.</i>

37:01.719 --> 37:05.255
<i> But, one day...</i>

37:07.158 --> 37:11.294
<i> A Sunday morning</i>
<i> before the sun came up...</i>

37:12.897 --> 37:15.599
<i> The colonel decided</i>
<i> to try out his pistol.</i>

37:18.169 --> 37:21.238
<i> He fired two bullets </i>
<i> through the closed window</i>
<i> into the garden.</i>

37:24.176 --> 37:26.543
<i> By chance, he hit a pigeon</i>

37:26.545 --> 37:29.412
<i> which was found wounded</i>
<i> in the garden the next day.</i>

37:31.349 --> 37:34.818
Then he fired one shot
at a bottle on the table...

37:37.188 --> 37:38.922
<i> Two more at the chandelier...</i>

37:42.426 --> 37:44.160
And then...

37:59.810 --> 38:05.548
Once, I found a note
in a crack in a desk drawer.

38:05.550 --> 38:08.218
It was written
in a woman's handwriting.

38:09.287 --> 38:13.256
"To my precious
little wolf cub.

38:13.258 --> 38:17.227
"In all my life I've
never met a better, more
generous man than you.

38:17.229 --> 38:21.398
<i> I am not worthy to kiss</i>
<i> the soles of your shoes."</i>

38:21.400 --> 38:25.535
There were two
spelling mistakes.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.506
It was signed with an n,

38:29.508 --> 38:31.975
and she sketched lips below it.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.488
Nobody knows anything
about anyone...

38:47.358 --> 38:50.427
Not even
the person you marry,

38:50.429 --> 38:52.329
and not even
about ourselves.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.832
We know nothing.

38:55.834 --> 38:59.669
But if we sometimes imagine
that we do know something,

38:59.671 --> 39:02.472
that's even worse.

39:02.474 --> 39:05.442
It's better to live
without knowing

39:05.444 --> 39:08.278
than to live in error.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.488
November 29, 1947

39:18.490 --> 39:20.290
tonight...

39:20.292 --> 39:22.292
At lake success, near New York,

39:22.294 --> 39:26.496
the general assembly of
the un will vote on what?

39:26.498 --> 39:29.299
Adopting the unscop proposal.

39:29.301 --> 39:30.800
And what's the proposal?

39:30.802 --> 39:34.671
To create two states
out of the British mandate:

39:34.673 --> 39:36.639
One Jewish, and one arab.

39:36.641 --> 39:41.978
Who opposes it?
The Muslim bloc and britain.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.481
And why?

39:44.483 --> 39:48.651
They want an arab state
under British protection.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.720
Like Egypt,
transjordan and Iraq.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.722
Well done!

39:52.724 --> 39:55.892
You know, the name
lake success...

39:55.894 --> 39:58.695
Is the opposite
of the sea of tears,

39:58.697 --> 40:01.531
with symbolized the fate of
our people for the poet bialik.

40:03.068 --> 40:06.403
It's interesting.
Interesting.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.152
<i> The resolution</i>

41:29.154 --> 41:32.755
<i> of the ad hoc committee</i>
<i> for palestine</i>

41:32.757 --> 41:37.627
<i> was adopted by 33 votes--</i>
<i> 13 against, 10 abstained.</i>

41:44.168 --> 41:48.404
The Jewish nation lives!
The Jewish nation lives!

42:20.504 --> 42:22.472
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

42:22.474 --> 42:25.508
Everything
is about to change.

42:25.510 --> 42:27.076
I told you it would.

42:29.213 --> 42:32.782
We brought peace unto you!

43:32.042 --> 43:35.878
You can't imagine what
the gentile boys did to me

43:35.880 --> 43:37.814
in my school in vilna.

43:41.952 --> 43:46.889
Then, when my father,
your grandfather, came
to the school to complain,

43:46.891 --> 43:48.725
they attacked him too.

43:48.727 --> 43:52.061
They threw him
to the ground,

43:52.063 --> 43:55.298
and removed his pants
in the middle of the yard.

43:57.134 --> 44:00.136
All the children laughed.

44:00.138 --> 44:03.072
And the teachers watched
and were silent.

44:05.576 --> 44:07.844
Some of them also laughed.

44:10.948 --> 44:13.950
Bullies may well
bully you someday

44:13.952 --> 44:17.320
in the street
or at school.

44:17.322 --> 44:20.556
They may do it just because
you're a bit like me.

44:21.992 --> 44:25.595
But from now on,
now that we have
our own state,

44:25.597 --> 44:28.765
you will never be bullied
just because you are a Jew.

44:28.767 --> 44:30.833
Never again.

44:41.612 --> 44:45.715
<i> A few hours later,</i>
<i> at seven in the morning,</i>

44:45.717 --> 44:48.151
<i> while we were all asleep,</i>

44:48.153 --> 44:52.789
<i> shots were fired on</i>
<i> Jewish vehicles in Jerusalem,</i>

44:52.791 --> 44:56.025
<i> which turned into riots</i>
<i> across the country.</i>

45:21.885 --> 45:24.120
My code name
is garibaldi.

45:27.357 --> 45:29.992
I'll be instructing
you how to help

45:29.994 --> 45:32.061
in our patriotic
wartime efforts.

45:33.363 --> 45:35.264
You will help...

45:37.001 --> 45:38.868
You will search all
the storage yards and sheds

45:38.870 --> 45:41.671
for empty bags
to fill with sand,

45:41.673 --> 45:43.906
and empty bottles
to make "cocktails"

45:43.908 --> 45:47.176
that will be very tasty
for the enemy.

45:47.178 --> 45:51.948
You also will
gather edible Greens
from empty fields,

45:51.950 --> 45:54.350
to help relieve
the hunger in Jerusalem.

45:54.352 --> 45:56.085
And we'll also serve
as look-outs...

45:56.087 --> 46:00.022
To observe any movements
by the brits.

46:00.024 --> 46:01.691
Now go!

46:29.253 --> 46:31.053
How beautiful.

46:31.055 --> 46:33.723
Wash them off
and I'll cook them
right now.

46:33.725 --> 46:35.892
You must be hungry
after all your food foraging.

46:39.396 --> 46:40.797
Put some water in this.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.809
Fanitchka?

46:52.811 --> 46:54.977
I joined the national guard.

47:00.751 --> 47:02.919
Don't you have anything
to say about that?

47:02.921 --> 47:05.688
What do you want me to say?

47:05.690 --> 47:08.024
Congratulations.
You're very brave.

47:14.298 --> 47:16.999
<i> The war infiltrated our home.</i>

47:17.001 --> 47:20.803
<i> Life became</i>
<i> rations, sandbags,</i>

47:20.805 --> 47:22.905
<i> mourning.</i>

47:53.203 --> 47:55.805
<i> In the lives of individuals,</i>

47:55.807 --> 47:57.807
<i> and in the lives of nations,</i>

47:57.809 --> 48:03.279
<i> the worst conflicts erupt</i>
<i> between two persecuted people.</i>

48:08.986 --> 48:13.155
<i> Only in the imagination</i>
<i> do the persecuted</i>
<i> unite in solidarity</i>

48:13.157 --> 48:16.292
<i> to fight together against</i>
<i> their ruthless oppressor.</i>

48:18.829 --> 48:20.830
<i> In reality,</i>

48:20.832 --> 48:23.332
<i> two children of</i>
<i> the same abusive father</i>

48:23.334 --> 48:25.935
<i> will not necessarily</i>
<i> become allies.</i>

48:29.506 --> 48:31.540
<i> Often, each sees</i>
<i> in his brother</i>

48:31.542 --> 48:34.577
<i> their father's</i>
<i> threatening ways.</i>

48:39.583 --> 48:43.486
<i> Europe abused the arabs,</i>
<i> humiliating them</i>
<i> with colonialism...</i>

48:45.289 --> 48:48.824
<i> And the same Europe persecuted</i>
<i> and annihilated the Jews.</i>

48:53.597 --> 48:57.867
<i> But the arabs see us</i>
<i> as an arrogant new branch</i>

48:57.869 --> 49:00.036
<i> of European colonialism</i>
<i> and exploitation,</i>

49:02.205 --> 49:07.109
<i> and we do not see arabs</i>
<i> as brothers in adversity,</i>

49:07.111 --> 49:12.615
<i> but rather, as anti-semites,</i>
<i> Nazis in disguise.</i>

49:16.888 --> 49:21.057
<i> ...after 30 years</i>
<i> of the British mandate...</i>

49:21.059 --> 49:24.393
<i> The new state was born</i>

49:24.395 --> 49:29.565
<i> with David Ben-gurion's</i>
<i> declaration in Tel Aviv</i>
<i> just hours earlier.</i>

49:29.567 --> 49:33.235
<i> For weeks, our</i>
<i> basement apartment was turned</i>
<i> into a kind of bomb shelter</i>

49:33.237 --> 49:36.138
<i> for the residents</i>
<i> of the apartments above us.</i>

49:43.580 --> 49:47.083
You're pulling. It hurts!

49:47.085 --> 49:49.952
What is this?
Crumbs everywhere!

49:49.954 --> 49:52.888
You can't make
such a mess here!

49:54.958 --> 49:58.327
A hundred Jews were burned alive
yesterday near sheikh Jarrah.

49:58.329 --> 50:01.263
They were in a convoy
going up to the hospital
and university.

50:01.265 --> 50:03.032
A hundred people!

50:03.034 --> 50:06.102
Doctors, nurses, students.

50:06.104 --> 50:09.972
-Why didn't we save them?
-The British wouldn't let us.

50:09.974 --> 50:11.507
Who can even stomach
this chicken,

50:11.509 --> 50:14.543
when horrors like that
happen right in front of us?

50:14.545 --> 50:17.013
The children haven't
eaten meat in two months.

50:36.466 --> 50:37.933
Here you go, ma'am.

50:45.175 --> 50:46.375
Who's next?

52:07.657 --> 52:10.392
<i> When her friend died,</i>

52:10.394 --> 52:15.464
<i> when real tragedy</i>
<i> landed outside the pages</i>
<i> of my mother's novels,</i>

52:15.466 --> 52:20.069
<i> the suffering</i>
<i> wasn't romantic at all.</i>

52:54.271 --> 52:56.605
There's an armistice
agreement with Egypt.

52:56.607 --> 53:01.343
Next will be transjordan,
and then Syria and Lebanon.

53:13.356 --> 53:15.558
<i> When the British left,</i>

53:15.560 --> 53:19.361
<i> the green line was drawn</i>
<i> around Israel.</i>

53:22.799 --> 53:24.633
<i> Our neighbors moved back</i>
<i> to their own homes,</i>

53:24.635 --> 53:26.802
<i> euphoric and optimistic,</i>

53:26.804 --> 53:31.540
<i> and left us along</i>
<i> to ourselves.</i>

53:31.542 --> 53:36.178
<i> The improbable creation</i>
<i> of the new state of Israel</i>

53:36.180 --> 53:41.317
<i> extinguished thousands</i>
<i> of years of Jewish longing</i>

53:41.319 --> 53:44.353
<i> for a homeland of its own.</i>

53:44.355 --> 53:49.258
<i> Maybe my mother felt the loss</i>
<i> of this passion, this dream,</i>

53:49.260 --> 53:53.896
<i> because suddenly she stopped</i>
<i> telling her stories.</i>

54:31.301 --> 54:33.869
What do my eyes see?

54:33.871 --> 54:37.873
A boy, about three, standing
in the middle of the street,

54:37.875 --> 54:40.776
and a military vehicle
rushing toward him.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.745
I mustered all my strength.

54:42.747 --> 54:45.214
I yelled to him.

54:45.216 --> 54:47.716
"Boy! Boy!"

54:47.718 --> 54:51.387
It seemed
my shout reached him,

54:51.389 --> 54:53.789
because he quickly
jumped aside.

54:53.791 --> 54:57.393
Who knows? Maybe
his mother left him alone,

54:57.395 --> 55:00.462
or maybe she's poor
and can't support him--

55:00.464 --> 55:02.965
and can't stand
to see him starve,

55:02.967 --> 55:05.467
or maybe he's an orphan.

55:05.469 --> 55:08.971
Yes, there are children
like that in our world too.

55:46.309 --> 55:47.576
Give me your sandwich!

55:49.279 --> 55:50.846
Give me your sandwich!

56:28.852 --> 56:33.322
Our blood will not
be spilled in vain!

56:33.324 --> 56:36.458
Abandoned property

57:05.889 --> 57:07.523
I'll be back
in fifteen minutes.

57:07.525 --> 57:09.858
Can I go with you?

57:09.860 --> 57:13.462
I need to be
alone for a bit.

57:13.464 --> 57:15.631
You can be alone too.

57:15.633 --> 57:17.766
I'll be back soon.

59:10.046 --> 59:11.980
Maybe you can
finally tell me.

59:11.982 --> 59:15.984
What is it about you that
makes me love you so much?

59:17.520 --> 59:20.155
More than anything...

59:20.157 --> 59:23.926
More than anything,
i love your innocence.

59:23.928 --> 59:25.661
I've never encountered
anything like it.

59:26.896 --> 59:29.831
Even after you live out
your entire life,

59:29.833 --> 59:31.867
and have all kinds
of experiences,

59:31.869 --> 59:35.904
your innocence
will never abandon you.

59:39.776 --> 59:44.246
I think you'll grow up
to be a man...

59:44.248 --> 59:47.683
Who is open and enthusiastic
like your father,

59:47.685 --> 59:53.021
but you'll also be a man who's
quiet and closed and full...

59:53.023 --> 59:55.257
Like a well
in a deserted village.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.194
You can be both.

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:18.547
<i> I felt a terrible dread</i>
<i> as if on the distant horizon,</i>

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:21.183
<i> a vague disaster</i>
<i> was taking shape.</i>

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:30.225
<i> My mother started having</i>
<i> frequent headaches.</i>

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:34.129
<i> Her migraines</i>
<i> gave her insomnia.</i>

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:55.917
<i> The doctor prescribed</i>
<i>sleeping pills and sedatives...</i>

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.655
<i> But nothing helped.</i>

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:16.872
Please don't be
angry with me, Amos.

01:01:16.874 --> 01:01:19.274
It's a little hard
for me right now.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:22.678
You see how much I'm trying
to make things right.

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:33.355
Thank you, Amos.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:35.791
I know I can rely
on you completely.

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:39.895
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:54.309
Papa?

01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:57.279
Sleep... sleep.

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:05.787
I'm so lucky.
I'm so lucky.

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:51.767
<i> It's 7:00, and these</i>
<i> are the headlines.</i>

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:54.903
<i> This year too, there is</i>
<i> an urgent need to find homes</i>

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:59.908
<i> for innocent children</i>
<i> with foster families</i>
<i> across the country.</i>

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:05.447
<i> Last year alone,</i>
<i> 50,000 children were</i>
<i> placed in homes.</i>

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:10.051
<i>Despite this achievement, there</i>
<i> are still 20,000 children,</i>

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:14.055
<i> who will have to spend</i>
<i> the winter months in tents.</i>

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:18.160
<i> 10,000 children ages 5-12,</i>

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:21.163
<i> need temporary housing</i>
<i> this winter</i>

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:24.466
<i> across the country.</i>

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:28.937
<i> The roots for children</i>
<i> project appeals to</i>
<i> every home in Israel</i>

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:32.474
<i> to host a child</i>
<i> from the camps...</i>

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:59.835
She's punishing herself.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:02.337
Just to punish me.

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:07.108
I have done.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:08.476
I have done.

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:12.781
I have been doing.
I have been doing.

01:04:12.783 --> 01:04:15.317
I should have done.

01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:19.955
I should have done.
I should have been doing.

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:09.404
Go...

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.975
Go play a little outside.

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:21.182
But be careful.

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:23.018
There are
all sorts out there.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.921
Not all women are as kind
and honest as you are.

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:40.201
You can come home
whenever you like.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.612
Do you need anything?

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:51.846
Amos is here.

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:16.531
<i> My father and I told people</i>
<i> that she had the flu</i>

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.967
<i> or a particular</i>
<i> sensitivity to sunlight,</i>

01:07:18.969 --> 01:07:22.137
<i> or that she gets</i>
<i> very tired.</i>

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:26.307
<i> We didn't tell anyone</i>
<i> what we both knew.</i>

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:28.977
<i> The only one who knew</i>
<i> was my mother's best friend.</i>

01:07:28.979 --> 01:07:30.678
Amos.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.981
You're a ray of sunshine,
you know?

01:07:32.983 --> 01:07:35.583
Your mother says that
you're her light.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:52.367
You're such a clever,
sensitive child.

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:56.271
You know,
i have a feeling...

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:59.741
That when you grow up
you will be a writer.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.710
I won't be a writer.

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:05.046
I'm not sensitive!

01:08:05.048 --> 01:08:09.350
I'll be a farmer
or a dog-poisoner with
a syringe full of poison.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:15.557
Have a good day.
You too...

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:36.243
Do you know what
happened when Tarzan met
the cowboys and Indians?

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:38.613
What happened?

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:43.218
Tarzan watched
from a tree as the cowboys
and Indians fought below.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:48.555
A cowboy caught a snake
by the throat

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:51.559
and poured its venom
into the Indian's mouth!

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.162
So the Indian grabbed
a thorny cactus

01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:58.066
and stabbed...

01:08:58.068 --> 01:09:00.234
The cowboy in his blue eyes.

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:03.138
Tarzan watched from above

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:07.308
and thought
about what to do.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.345
And then what?

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:15.116
I'll tell you tomorrow.

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:22.557
The story was great.
Where did you hear it?

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.595
Hey-- isn't
that your dad?

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.831
Where?

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:57.752
Ah!

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:49.237
Amos... you're being
very good.

01:11:49.239 --> 01:11:51.739
Your mother has
a terrible headache.

01:11:51.741 --> 01:11:53.908
Keep your voice down.

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:57.245
And no running
around, okay?

01:11:57.247 --> 01:11:58.246
Get the door.

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:15.763
- Do you need anything?
- No, thank you.

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:17.265
Then why don't you lie down?

01:12:17.267 --> 01:12:21.002
I'm fine
like this, thank you.

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:23.604
Do you see a doctor?
I don't need a doctor.

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:25.940
Mother, leave her alone.
Don't interfere, arieh.

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:29.277
She's being so dramatic,
as if she deserves the moon.

01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:32.347
So what? Moods.
Melancholia.

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:34.849
It just shows that her
heart is still young.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:37.285
As if she's the only one
having a hard time here!

01:12:37.287 --> 01:12:40.021
That the rest of us
are living in luxury!

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:05.373
<i>Behold, I call heaven and earth</i>
<i> today to bear witness</i>

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:08.075
<i> that I have set before you</i>
<i> life and death,</i>

01:14:08.077 --> 01:14:11.112
the blessing and the curse.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:13.581
Therefore choose life,

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:17.885
so that you and your
descendants may live.

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:54.555
Did you finish your homework?

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.594
Fania?

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:03.431
How did you sleep?

01:15:03.433 --> 01:15:05.867
Well, I finally
slept well.

01:15:05.869 --> 01:15:10.438
The new pills
must be working.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.173
I had so many dreams.

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:18.679
One was about someone I hadn't
thought about in years.

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:21.649
In rovno, there was
a rich fur trader

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:24.785
who even got
orders from Paris,

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:29.123
because he had a rare type
of fur, the silver fox.

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:33.427
Furs that sparkled like
frost in the moonlight.

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:36.464
But one day...

01:15:36.466 --> 01:15:39.200
The merchant became
a strict vegetarian.

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:42.970
He left his home and built
a small cabin in the woods,

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:45.806
because he felt sorry

01:15:45.808 --> 01:15:49.076
for the thousands of foxes
hunters had killed for his furs.

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.213
And then
he disappeared completely.

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:58.719
When my sisters and i
wanted to scare each other,

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:02.890
the three of us lay
on the carpet in the dark.

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:05.893
And took turns telling...

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:10.831
How the man who was
once a rich furrier

01:16:10.833 --> 01:16:13.935
now roams naked
through the forest.

01:16:13.937 --> 01:16:16.203
Maybe he has rabies?

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:19.106
Maybe he howls
bloodcurdling cries?

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:23.778
But anyone who meets the fox-man
in the forest at night...

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:27.848
His hair instantly
turns white in terror.

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:29.917
Excuse me. What is
that supposed to be?

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:32.253
An allegory?
An old-wives' tale?

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:37.525
Sorry.

01:16:37.527 --> 01:16:41.796
Don't be late for
school or work, boys.

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:50.638
What's the matter with you?
What's your problem?

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.175
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:39.086
Today I decided to invite
the two men in my life

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:41.589
to lunch at a restaurant.

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:43.824
Does dad know?

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.326
We'll surprise him.

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.261
Let's go to his office

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:50.331
and drag him out
like a moth from a book.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:52.600
Come.

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:58.873
Today, you'll be my cavalier.

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:01.676
What's a cavalier?
A cavalier is a knight.

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:03.277
<i> Cheval</i> is French for horse,

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:05.846
and <i> chevalier</i> is
a knight on horseback.

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:21.696
Thank you.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:32.039
Arieh.

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.282
Excuse me for a minute.

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:46.987
What happened?
Are my parents all right?

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:48.856
Your parents?
Is everyone all right?

01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:50.925
Yes, everyone is fine.

01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:52.660
We're surprising you.

01:18:52.662 --> 01:18:54.662
We're taking you
out to lunch.

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.901
Sure. Why not?

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.038
Today I'm hosting,

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.141
and I'd love
if you ordered the most
expensive items on the menu.

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:17.918
Are you ready?

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.120
Yes.

01:19:19.122 --> 01:19:20.688
Vegetable soup

01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:22.790
and chicken with
mashed potatoes, please.

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:25.259
The same
for me, please.

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:30.064
Fania?

01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:33.000
Fania?

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:38.806
Just some white rice, please.

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.441
And a cup of black coffee.

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:45.312
Thank you.

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.941
Fania?

01:20:13.943 --> 01:20:18.145
Fania? Fanitchka?

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:29.156
Mummy, are you all right?

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:48.776
She needs total rest.

01:20:48.778 --> 01:20:50.945
I'll take care of it.

01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:52.446
Thank you, doctor.

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:15.035
These are the new pills.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.374
They'll help you sleep.

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:26.146
Have some more water.

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.947
I don't know how to help you.

01:21:59.949 --> 01:22:02.182
I'm not your responsibility.

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:05.819
Fania, I don't know
how to help you.

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:10.524
Maybe I'll take you
to Tel Aviv

01:22:10.526 --> 01:22:13.527
to be with your sisters
and get some fresh air.

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:19.266
Yes, fresh air.

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:32.246
It's not reparations. They can't
keep what they stole from us.

01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:36.216
And we need the money
to absorb the survivors.

01:22:36.218 --> 01:22:38.218
What are
you talking about?

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:42.623
It's blood money.
We can't sell them forgiveness.

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:51.298
A few days in Tel Aviv
and you'll be good as new.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.601
No wonder you're miserable.
You live in Jerusalem.

01:22:54.603 --> 01:22:59.306
We're going to pamper you.
All you have to do is rest.

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.544
Fania, maybe
you'll try some cake?

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.081
I'm not hungry.

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:08.949
You're not
eating at all.

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:10.651
You sound like mother.

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.681
The change of scenery
will do her good.

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:45.119
She's from Jerusalem.
She doesn't even know
what a beach is.

01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:47.988
Summer here
would be too much.

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:50.257
It's true.

01:23:54.997 --> 01:23:57.398
<i> That night,</i>
<i> the ayalon river</i>

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.333
<i> overflowed the banks</i>

01:23:59.335 --> 01:24:04.104
<i> and flooded part of Tel Aviv.</i>

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:49.249
<i> My mother grew up</i>
<i> in an ethereal culture</i>
<i> of misted beauty</i>

01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:51.718
<i> whose wings</i>
<i> were finally dashed</i>

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:57.491
<i> on the harsh Jerusalem stone,</i>
<i> hot and dusty.</i>

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:15.375
<i> Twenty years after completing</i>
<i> her studies in rovno,</i>

01:25:15.377 --> 01:25:17.444
<i> that romantic schoolgirl</i>

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:21.715
<i> was confronted by daily life,</i>

01:25:21.717 --> 01:25:26.253
<i> the heat waves,</i>
<i> poverty, and violence,</i>

01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:29.123
<i> diapers, migraines,</i>

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:32.559
<i> ration lines, marriage.</i>

01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:38.398
<i> The promise of her childhood</i>
<i> was trampled underfoot</i>

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.635
<i> and ridiculed by the monotony</i>
<i> of life itself.</i>

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:14.168
<i> Perhaps when life failed to</i>
<i>fill the promises of her youth,</i>

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:17.337
<i> my mother began</i>
<i> to envision death</i>

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:22.843
<i> as a protective,</i>
<i> soothing lover.</i>

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:34.748
<i> My version of her story</i>
<i> would have ended differently.</i>

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.712
<i> But it was her story to tell.</i>

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:18.225
Is your father home?

01:28:18.227 --> 01:28:20.727
There's a call from Tel Aviv.
It's urgent, please!

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:20.287
<i> A few years after</i>
<i> my mother's death,</i>

01:29:20.289 --> 01:29:25.459
<i> I left my father</i>
<i> and all of Jerusalem,</i>

01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:27.728
<i> changed my name,</i>

01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:30.597
<i> and went to</i>
<i> kibbutz hulda on my own.</i>

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.476
<i> My mother's dream,</i>

01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:44.644
<i> milk and honey,</i>

01:29:44.646 --> 01:29:48.014
<i> make the desert bloom,</i>

01:29:48.016 --> 01:29:49.483
<i> pioneer.</i>

01:29:49.485 --> 01:29:50.917
Hello.

01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:52.652
Amos?

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:58.759
Hello!

01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:02.796
You're taller than me!

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:23.583
Can you hand me
my suitcase, please?

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:27.754
Thank you.

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:50.610
<i> Though I forced myself to</i>
<i>learn how to drive a tractor...</i>

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:54.881
<i> Lay irrigation hoses,</i>

01:30:54.883 --> 01:30:57.984
<i> hit the target</i>
<i> with a Czech rifle, </i>

01:30:57.986 --> 01:31:01.955
<i> I still did not manage</i>
<i> to transform myself.</i>

01:31:10.731 --> 01:31:15.135
<i> No one was taken</i>
<i> in by my suntan.</i>

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:21.741
<i> They all knew perfectly well,</i>
<i> and I knew it myself,</i>

01:31:21.743 --> 01:31:25.145
<i> that even when</i>
<i> my skin was bronzed,</i>

01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:29.049
<i> I would still be pale</i>
<i> on the inside.</i>

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:33.920
This is
my school now.

<i> hopeful and</i>
<i> not disappointing,</i>

01:31:43.699 --> 01:31:47.534
