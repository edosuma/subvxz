The guy is a moneymaker.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.538
What kind of meathead skips the combine
and expects to go in the first round?

01:27.629 --> 01:30.041
That move got a lot of people talking, buddy.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.668
Yeah, and GMs looking the other way.

01:31.758 --> 01:35.250
It's not like you to dismiss
such a good piece of business so easily.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.301
I'm a Miami Hurricane to the core, okay?

01:37.389 --> 01:39.220
We don't fraternize
with those Seminole douchebags.

01:39.308 --> 01:42.141

my registration approved first.

-Not a peep, buddy.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.642
Glazer can't find a fucking thing.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.398
By the way, Vernon's losing his mind.

01:53.488 --> 01:57.197
Do you really think the team's gonna release
their star defensive tackle over an NFI?

01:57.284 --> 01:59.616
They let DeMarco walk
after he led the league in rushing.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.910
-Anything's possible.
-Well, stay on it.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.706
I doubt I'm gonna have any service out here
in the swamp or wherever the fuck I am.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.579

the sweaty ball sack of the South.

-Nice.
-(LAUGHS) Hey.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.590

-Thank you.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.922
How's your hip? You get it checked out yet?

02:18.013 --> 02:21.130
No, I would say a couple of days closer
to a triumphant return to form.

-l'm serious, Spence.
-l'm serious, too.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.971
I'll get a cortisone shot this week.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.973
I got to go to the med center
to get some PT done.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.429
I'm gonna be good. Hip's good.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.230
Listen, I don't want to freak you out,

02:32.819 --> 02:34.320

Uh, yeah, but ESPN is the holy grail
of sports reporting.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.965
They're probably looking
at a number of people.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.296
They don't do open calls, Trace.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.131
You clearly got their attention.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.308
Thank you. I guess so.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.056
Looks like I lost yours.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.145
Doesn't she work for Suh?

03:18.240 --> 03:21.107
Yep, she works for Suh.

an in-person with Coach Payton

03:24.788 --> 03:26.904

03:36.341 --> 03:37.922
Like the Jews out of Egypt,

03:38.009 --> 03:39.965
the road to the promised land
is long and hard.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.920

-Won five grand on the hardwood this week.

-I got to go pick it up.
-Let me keep you company.

No, haven't had the pleasure.
Spencer, good to meet you.

04:35.650 --> 04:40.144
And of course you know the legendary
Miami nightlife impresario, Mr. Derrick Rubin.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.694
Legendary. Yeah, we met a few times.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.945
I still remember the night
that we tore it up at the Delano in '08.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.572
Ah, yeah,
it was right after we won the AFC East.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.199
And if I'm not mistaken,
I got carried out of that party.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.497
If I'm not mistaken,
you were carried in as well.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.245
(LAUGHS) It was a good night.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.746
And of course you know the lovely Victoria.

-I do. Hello, Victoria.
-Hello, Spencer.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.754
-lt's good to see you. How is Suh?
-He's great.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.674
We tried getting a hold of you last night.
You didn't pick up.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.501
I know, I was dealing with a crisis.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.338
Oh, that's terrible. Everything okay?

05:08.225 --> 05:09.260
Everything's good.

getting an invitation

05:13.605 --> 05:15.220

05:17.067 --> 05:18.056
Oh!

05:19.027 --> 05:20.608
We're looking at some land development.

-You know Suh loves engineering.
-I do know that, yeah.

Can't play football forever.
The transition is about time

05:26.034 --> 05:28.696

yourself with the right people.

You know what I'm saying, right?

05:32.207 --> 05:33.413

09:39.329 --> 09:41.240
Looks delicious. (SNIFFS)

09:41.331 --> 09:42.696
SO, how's things?

09:42.791 --> 09:44.907
Things are great. Never better.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.411
-Yeah, got a cat.
-Really?

09:46.503 --> 09:47.663
-Mmm-hmm.
-What kind?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.665
-Oh, my God...
-Can I be honest?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.251
I really don't give a shit.

09:52.342 --> 09:56.085
I hear Vernon Littelfield
might get released by the Dallas Cowboys.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.761
Ricky Jerret just got passed over
by the Dolphins.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.807
Having Ndamukong Suh on the roster
just doesn't cut it anymore.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.687
-Can I ask you something, Spencer?
-Yep.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.940
What are you doing with the division?

10:11.027 --> 10:13.143
Can you give me something,

10:13.238 --> 10:16.321
anything that makes me believe
you have a plan?

10:18.576 --> 10:21.113
-Travis Mack.
-The nutjob from FSU?

10:21.204 --> 10:23.445
I wish there were room
on this deck for cartwheels.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.077
-He's a surefire first-round draft pick.
-Really?

10:26.167 --> 10:28.749
Pundits say he's lucky
if he even makes it into the first round.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.294
But in our hands, he's gonna be top 10, easy.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.837
He's gonna sign a huge contract.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.585
He's gonna attract more young clients.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.007
And he's gonna lead us right into the future.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.755
NFLPA forbids you to touch him.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.006
No risk, no reward.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.304
Ah, reward.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.973
(LAUGHS) That brings me
to the theme Of the day.

10:44.060 --> 10:48.269
You guys are certainly great
at rewarding yourselves.

10:48.356 --> 10:54.067
Let's see, 1,200 at Capital Grille,
600 for a beach bar in Key Largo.

10:54.154 --> 10:58.648

10:58.741 --> 11:01.653

11:01.744 --> 11:03.450
We were trying to save Spice Adams.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.160
-Every client matters.
-Here's an idea.

11:08.251 --> 11:11.789
A little wacky, a little crazy,
a little unorthodox.

11:11.880 --> 11:16.294
Bring me new clients
who actually make money.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.922
And then invest that money.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.594
Why did he need to be saved?

11:21.681 --> 11:25.594
We kind of poached T-Sizzle
and we caught some fire for it.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.052
Who exactly did you "kind of"
poach him from?

11:29.147 --> 11:31.354
-Miami Wealth Management.
-Andre?

11:31.441 --> 11:33.022
SPENCER: Andre.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.277
You're kidding, right? This is a joke?

11:37.363 --> 11:40.605
You're taking this on the road?
You are minnows.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.067
Okay?
Minnows do not go after sharks for a reason.

11:44.162 --> 11:48.531
They will eat you alive,
swallow you whole, spit you out for bait.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.831
Whose idea was this?

11:49.918 --> 11:52.079
Sizz was gonna leave him
whether he signed with us or not.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.707
-NO sense in letting somebody else get...
-It was my idea.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.333
And I take full responsibility.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.915
I appreciate that, Spencer. I really do.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.046
DO me a favor,
next time you have a bright idea,

12:01.137 --> 12:03.002
"kind of" don't do it.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.588
Now get Off my boat.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.639
No, finish your Bellinis.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.600
Now get Off my boat.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.852
Ah, thank you.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.980

you got to give us some clue.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.686
HAL: I'm telling you,
I still don't know anything.

12:19.781 --> 12:20.987
Is this some kind of mindfuck?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.531
A mindfuck is your client

12:23.618 --> 12:27.611
not answering the door when I fly
all the way to Miami to check on him.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.787
Hal, he was scared. The kid was scared.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.660
We're all scared.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.660
You can’t just hunker down
and hide from the world,

12:34.754 --> 12:36.494
disrespect your employers.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.126
No, I get it. Listen, just give me two minutes
on the phone with the boss.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.423
That way, I can vouch for Vernon.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.000
I can hardly get a minute myself.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.381
Okay, well, when you do, tell him I said

12:44.472 --> 12:46.428
that the kid made a mistake
and he copped to it.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.596
That's got to count for something.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.015
/ know he’s got a soft spot for you,

12:49.102 --> 12:51.559
but right now I'm not sure it counts for shit.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.853

13:02.907 --> 13:05.239
A run defense that was exposed last season

13:05.326 --> 13:07.442
will look to the waiver wire
for additional support.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.074

to address the media.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.331
Everybody calm down, by the way,
it's coming up next.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.083
Let go Of your balls and grow the fuck up.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.336
Let’s go live to the Cowboys’
press conference at Valley Ranch.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.058
Hello?

20:34.150 --> 20:36.391
You down here or what?

20:36.485 --> 20:38.737
MAN: Is that you?

20:38.821 --> 20:41.028
NO, it's Bob fucking Woodward.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.026
MAN: Who's that?

20:43.117 --> 20:46.985
He's a... Oh, forget it.
Will you just come out so I can see you?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.616
MAN: You first.

20:49.707 --> 20:53.620
I am standing
in the middle Of the garage, asshole.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.880
Hey, Joe.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.170
(CHUCKLES) Max.

20:59.717 --> 21:00.957
Love your new office.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.464
Hey, for sensitive matters like this,
I like to Operate under the radar.

21:04.555 --> 21:07.547
SO you did get something for me, huh?

21:07.641 --> 21:09.677
Full disclosure on your boy Andre Allen.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.805
Best I could do in a day.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.136
There's some good little bits in there.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.766
This is more than I expected.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.848
My skills are tailor-made
for investigative work.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.145
Turns out there is life after disbarment.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.770
Wow!

21:23.365 --> 21:25.947
This is a new low for you, Max.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.525
How the hell did you pull this off?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.612
Same way I got everything else done.
With my charm.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.866
(LAUGHS)

21:32.082 --> 21:33.868
But, no, really, how did you pull it off?

21:35.002 --> 21:36.208
With my charm.

21:36.587 --> 21:39.374
-All right, tell me later, then.
-All right.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.332
Hey, give me the number to this garage.
I want to call you sometime.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.836
1-800-go-fuck-yourself.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.338
JOE: That's toll-free. That's good.

21:45.429 --> 21:49.763
There’s been a heap of speculation
about Vernon Littelﬁe/d’s Achilles.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.886
I want to state our position clearly.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.221
Vernon Littelﬁeld injured himself
while training.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.939

21:59.109 --> 22:00.519
Come on!

22:00.611 --> 22:02.693
This shit's for real.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.487
-There's more. There's more.
-That's what I'm talking about.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.031
Mr. Jones, myself,
and the rest of the organization

22:08.118 --> 22:10.450
-has the utmost faith in Vernon.
-Yes!

22:10.538 --> 22:13.621
He ’s getting the ﬁnest medical attention
and therapy available.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.699
And we expect to see him
back on the ﬁeld at some point next season.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.876
-Yeah! Yes!
-Come on with it!

22:18.963 --> 22:21.670
-Come on! Come on! Come on!
-See, this is a great day.

22:21.757 --> 22:25.875
We can finally come all together,
and take a collective deep breath.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.382
-Come on. Ah!
-All right.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.679
-l'll call you later, superstar. Okay.
-All right, Spence.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.758
-Big Nate.
-All right.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.559
-Give it here.
-(GUN FIRES)

22:35.646 --> 22:38.604
-(LAUGH|NG)
-Oh, man.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.147
-Now you're even.
-Come on, man.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.768
-Ah!
-Fuck, how you feeling, Reggie?

we always take care Of our guys.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

23:47.760 --> 23:49.500
Baby, I'm home.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.802
JULIE: Hey, baby. How was your workout?

23:53.599 --> 23:57.183
Uh, yeah, it was good. Yeah.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.306
Then I met up with Siefert.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.806
-And they cut me.
-They what?

24:05.152 --> 24:07.063
Yeah, they cut me.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.270
Signed a new right tackle, put me on waivers.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.105
Baby, they can't do that.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.781
Oh, they do it all the time.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.369
Those soulless motherfuckers.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.910
No, no. No, no, no. It's all good.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.204
I'm just grateful we got the extra season.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.497
But you can still play.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.745
If you want to find another team,
we'll work out the logistics.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.246
We'll move wherever we got to go.

24:24.338 --> 24:27.375
You got a career to protect, Dr. Greane.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.833
It's all good. Really, it is.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.884
I know what's important to me. It's right here.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.838
Baby, I love you.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.431
I hear your baby waking up.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.884
SO I'm gonna go get her
and then I'll make you some dinner.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.970
All right? Okay.

24:45.693 --> 24:50.483
Okay, well, I was hoping for something
a little less pornographic.

24:50.864 --> 24:54.072
You want to smack him in the mouth for real,
this is how it's done.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.833
-Hey, Joe, do me a favor.
-Yeah.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.501
Let me talk to him alone.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.670
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

25:12.761 --> 25:14.752
Yeah, I get it.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.925
You don't want me
to intimidate him too much.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.348
-No.
-Smart.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.300
Thank you, buddy.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.240
Hey, man, you want a beer?

25:42.583 --> 25:44.198
I don't drink beers with assholes.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.783
Oh, come on. Don't be like that.

25:45.878 --> 25:50.247
I got left in a swamp,
chased by a Burmese python or whatever,

25:50.340 --> 25:52.467
chewed on by so many mosquitoes,

25:52.551 --> 25:55.509
I can feel the Zika virus
coursing through my blood.

25:55.596 --> 26:00.010
So forgive me when I say,
"Have a nice life, Tracy."

26:02.478 --> 26:04.434
God damn it, I love this dude, man!

26:06.190 --> 26:07.930
Jeez.

26:08.025 --> 26:11.142
-Hey, where you going?
-Back to civilization, dickhead.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.272
Hold up, hold up. Wait.

26:14.073 --> 26:18.191
Look, all right,
I know I gave you a tough time.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.742
| just wanted to see
if you had some cojones, and you do.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.079
I mean, some agent from LA
had to be medevaced out Of here last month.

26:24.166 --> 26:28.125
I've been doing this too long to take shit
from some weak punk like you.

26:28.337 --> 26:32.922
All right, look, man, I'm sorry. All right?

26:33.008 --> 26:35.215
I said I'm sorry. You heard me.

26:35.302 --> 26:39.170
Okay? And I really... I need your help.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.964
Even more than you know, Travis.

26:42.559 --> 26:45.175
SO does that mean I got an agent or what?

26:49.900 --> 26:53.484
SO, Andre, why do you care about us?

26:53.570 --> 26:57.654
There's at least a half a dozen firms
who contend for athletes in the city.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.858
Because it's my city and I grew up here,
and you guys are just passing through.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.033
You're like tourists.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.988
SO why the fuck
do you care if we share the scraps?

27:05.082 --> 27:09.121
Better be careful that the Sizz and Suh
don't hear that you're calling them scraps.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.247
Come on, you know what I mean.

27:12.339 --> 27:15.046
Hey, listen, ltook Sizz,
so I won't fight you over Suh.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.249
He's the higher-earning client.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.083
-He's all yours.
-Okay.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.885
SO why don't we just call that a day
before things get ugly?

27:26.395 --> 27:28.431
Mmm. Interesting.

27:30.023 --> 27:34.642
What do we have in here?
A picture of me fucking my nanny?

27:34.736 --> 27:39.651
A picture of me fucking
three of my nannies at once?

27:39.741 --> 27:42.574
Listen, if I'm making money
for my clients and my company,

27:42.661 --> 27:44.367
nobody gives a fuck if I'm fucking my nanny.

27:44.454 --> 27:47.446
You need to get Sizzle back where he belongs

27:47.541 --> 27:49.907
and then we can get back to business
as usual.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.371
Okay?

27:52.462 --> 27:56.125
Now, if you think it was easy for you
to dig some shit up on me,

27:56.216 --> 28:01.051
how easy do you think it's gonna be for me
to dig up some shit about your partner Joe?

28:01.138 --> 28:05.598
Or imagine what I can do with what I already
know about you, my friend.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.936
I'm too big to fail, Spence.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.103
And you just entered a world Of hurt.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.359
