WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:03.421
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.545 --> 00:05.092
Ye need not be scared of me,

00:05.214 --> 00:07.467
nor anyone else here,
so long as I'm with ye.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.183
You're coming on the road.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.682
I think it would be wise
to have a healer along.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.981
Have you seen
any of your Scottish companions

00:14.389 --> 00:16.265
raise funds for the rebellion?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.649
Captain, I refuse to submit
further to this interrogation.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.857
You have no right to that woman.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.988
Now, she must be returned
to me for protection.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.819
I'm afraid further
questions have arisen.

00:26.902 --> 00:29.655
Be sure to deliver her
to Fort William by sundown tomorrow.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.457
I can only legally refuse
to hand ye back to Randall

00:32.573 --> 00:35.953
if I can change ye
from a English woman to a Scot.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.543
- Dougal wants us to be married.
- I know.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.125
Well, doesn't it bother
you that I'm not a virgin?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.970
No, so long as it doesna
bother you that I am.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

02:33.654 --> 02:34.826
Ready?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.240
For what?

02:40.952 --> 02:43.626
Right, then, folks. Lovely.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.299
- Now?
'Why not?

02:51.296 --> 02:52.639
What about your parents?

02:52.714 --> 02:53.966
They've been waiting for us
at the restaurant.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.551
Let them wait.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.470
Frank, they've never even met me.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.180
Yeah, so?

03:00.263 --> 03:02.516
They'll never meet Claire Beauchamp.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.610
I will have the pleasure
of introducing them

03:05.686 --> 03:08.314
to Mrs. Frank Randall.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.195
You... You're mad.

03:13.110 --> 03:16.114
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather a big church wedding or...

03:16.196 --> 03:17.789
No, no.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.116
I'm sure.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.538
Maybe your family would prefer it.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.962
Darling, the only family
I care about is you

03:24.454 --> 03:27.958
and the family
that we will make together.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.301
Will you marry me?

03:33.463 --> 03:34.840
Of course.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.433
<i>You may kiss yer bride.</i>

03:52.524 --> 03:55.243
<i>You forget your life after awhile...</i>

03:57.112 --> 03:59.080
<i>The life you had before.</i>

03:59.740 --> 04:01.708
<i>Things you cherish and hold dear</i>

04:01.783 --> 04:04.252
<i>are like pearls on a string.</i>

04:06.288 --> 04:09.167
<i>Cut the knot,
they scatter across the floor,</i>

04:09.249 --> 04:12.344
<i>rolling into dark comers,
never to be found again.</i>

04:14.337 --> 04:15.839
<i>So you move on.</i>

04:17.298 --> 04:20.599
<i>And eventually you forget
what the pearls even looked like.</i>

04:23.847 --> 04:25.599
<i>Or at least you try.</i>

04:39.988 --> 04:42.491
Sounds like the wedding
party is still going strong.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.081
Don't suppose they're
going to bed anytime soon.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.212
No.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.636
Not until they know
we've made things official.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.226
Should be grateful
they didn't want to watch.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.178
Only Rupert and Angus.

05:04.513 --> 05:05.890
A wee joke.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.773
You're a regular Bob Hope.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.570
Was he a funny man?

05:16.066 --> 05:17.818
I always thought so.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.209
- Perhaps a drink?
- Aye.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.331
To a lady of grace,

05:31.873 --> 05:33.466
a woman of strength,

05:34.042 --> 05:36.761
and a bride of astonishing beauty.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.216
My wife.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.394
Claire Fraser.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.023
You needn't be afraid of me, Claire.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.567
I wasna planning
to suddenly force myself on you.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.992
Never thought you would.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.163
I have questions.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.162
Ah, I suppose you do...

06:53.663 --> 06:55.631
Under the circumstances.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.261
What is it you want to know?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.969
Well, I...

07:05.675 --> 07:07.348
What the hell.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.395
Might as well come
straight out with it.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.356
Why did you agree to marry me?

07:14.851 --> 07:17.855
I mean, Dougal didn't give me
much of a choice, but you...

07:17.979 --> 07:21.574
Well, I...
I didna see I had much choice either.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.277
We do not have much time.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.613
Captain Randall
is expecting Mistress Beauchamp

07:25.695 --> 07:27.868
to be delivered to him tomorrow.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.669
Now, we are
all about to embark on a boat

07:31.743 --> 07:33.996
built entirely of paper.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.214
The letter of the law
is the only thing

07:36.289 --> 07:38.712
Keeping Claire
out of Randall's hands.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.217
And so if it is to work, then we
have to follow it to the letter.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.553
The marriage must be
consummated right away

07:45.632 --> 07:48.636
and witnesses must swear that
they were present in the building

07:48.718 --> 07:51.016
if not in the room itself.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.185
Does Claire know about all this?

07:53.264 --> 07:54.766
She has no say in the matter.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.565
I thought you
didn't hold with rape, Dougal.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.897
No rape. Persuasion.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.782
She's a smart lass.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.493
She'll see the reason
for it in the end,

08:05.568 --> 08:09.163
but there can be no secret agreements
between the two of ya,

08:09.239 --> 08:11.913
you saying
that you have when you have not.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.832
Besides, I can think
of worse things in my lifetime

08:14.911 --> 08:17.539
than holding
onto that sweet pair of ciochan,

08:17.706 --> 08:19.379
- plunging my cock...
- Yeah, enough!

08:21.209 --> 08:23.303
If Claire does become my wife,

08:23.378 --> 08:24.675
I'll thank you to stop talking

08:24.754 --> 08:26.347
and thinking of her
like some common whore.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.096
Hey! If?

08:29.259 --> 08:30.852
There is no if about this, laddie.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.895
Now, she took
a few blows at the hands of Randall

08:32.971 --> 08:35.224
and kept silent,
which is a fair sight more

08:35.306 --> 08:36.808
than I'd expect
of any ordinary woman.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.268
But you know Randall.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.852
You know what he's capable of.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.357
What do you think'll happen to her

08:41.438 --> 08:43.236
if she falls into his hands again?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.539
So you married me to keep me safe.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.872
Aye.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.162
That's the gist of it.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.970
You have my name,

09:06.796 --> 09:08.013
my clan,

09:09.049 --> 09:10.392
my family.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.975
And, if necessary,

09:14.429 --> 09:16.602
the protection of my body as well.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.183
Tell me about your family.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.148
How many generations back?

10:07.565 --> 10:09.363
Your parents will do.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.694
Aye.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.040
My father was a Fraser.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.876
Of course.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.249
A younger half-brother
to the present master...

10:23.998 --> 10:26.626
Colum and Dougal...
My mother was Aileen MacKenzie,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.882
the elder sister of Colum and Dougal.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.056
Colum wished my mother
to marry Malcolm Grant.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.049
My Aunt Janet is dead,
like my mother,

10:33.133 --> 10:34.851
but my Aunt Jocasta...

10:34.926 --> 10:37.179
I had my father see me grow up.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.771
I was always grateful for that.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.232
<i>It was a distraction, to be sure,</i>

10:41.724 --> 10:44.523
<i>but a welcome one for both of us.</i>

10:44.602 --> 10:46.900
<i>When he told me his family history,</i>

10:46.980 --> 10:48.982
<i>I reciprocated in kind...</i>

10:49.899 --> 10:51.776
<i>And we each spent
the next several hours</i>

10:51.901 --> 10:53.995
<i>drinking and talking and...</i>

10:54.529 --> 10:55.906
<i>Generally getting to know</i>

10:55.989 --> 10:57.912
<i>our new spouses for the first time.</i>

10:59.033 --> 11:02.128
First evening with the girl,
everyone waited

11:02.245 --> 11:04.043
to see would she take him or no?

11:05.748 --> 11:07.091
<i>He was charming,</i>

11:07.167 --> 11:09.010
<i>a born storyteller, like most Scots.</i>

11:09.085 --> 11:11.213
She told Malcolm Grant off.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.095
And he headed home as a result.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.428
<i>As the hours passed, I began to relax</i>

11:18.094 --> 11:19.812
<i>and eventually to enjoy myself</i>

11:19.888 --> 11:21.265
And your mother?

11:21.347 --> 11:24.396
She and my father
slipped out of the castle

11:24.475 --> 11:27.399
right under the noses
of 300 clansmen.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.400
And my father loved
telling that story.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.958
I told you to stand back, ye coof ye!

11:41.034 --> 11:43.162
I wasn't gonna ponce
around outside the door, was I?

11:43.328 --> 11:45.080
Waiting for them to answer...

11:45.205 --> 11:47.299
Like we were just coming
by for a nice cup of tea.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.632
And just what are you doing?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.969
Dougal sent us up to see if ye'd...

11:52.378 --> 11:54.301
- Y'ken?
- Now, who's the coof?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.223
- They've still got their clothes on.
- Get out.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.801
You can still do it
with your clothes on.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.477
I know that,
but not on your wedding night!

12:00.762 --> 12:03.641
I was just hoping to get
a wee keek at her breasts.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.312
They're related to you?

12:09.520 --> 12:10.942
Rupert only.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.030
Distant cousin.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.714
It's getting rather late.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.958
Perhaps we should go to bed?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.087
To bed...

12:35.964 --> 12:37.341
Or to sleep?

12:39.968 --> 12:41.185
Well...

12:48.893 --> 12:53.114
Either way you're... Not likely
to sleep in your corset, so I'll...

12:54.440 --> 12:56.442
I'll help you with the...

12:56.693 --> 12:58.411
The laces and such.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.401
Skins first.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.319
Aye.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.049
It's my turn.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.963
Where did you learn
to kiss like that?

15:57.373 --> 15:59.375
I said I was a virgin...

16:00.084 --> 16:01.461
Not a monk.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.507
If I need guidance... I'll ask.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.956
Jamie, you're crushing me.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.316
So was it like
you thought it would be?

17:47.483 --> 17:48.700
Almost.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.576
I thought...

17:54.782 --> 17:57.331
No, never mind.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.833
What? Tell me.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.957
You'll laugh at me.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.339
Promise, I won't laugh.

18:17.722 --> 18:20.225
I didna realize
you did it face-to-face.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.651
I thought you must
do it the back way,

18:22.727 --> 18:25.105
you know, like...
Like horses, ye ken.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.364
I'm sorry.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.616
I know, I promised I wouldn't laugh.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.368
I'll ask you a question.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.708
Of course.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.494
Did you like it?

18:48.044 --> 18:49.921
Murtagh was right about that, then.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.215
Murtagh?

18:53.633 --> 18:56.011
He said women generally
do not care for it.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.726
Well, he and Rupert.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.559
And Ned.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.521
They offered a lot of advice
on the subject last night.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.754
I did like it, Jamie.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.092
<i>There it was.</i>

19:37.009 --> 19:40.138
<i>Not only was I a bigamist
and an adulteress,</i>

19:40.680 --> 19:42.432
<i>but I'd enjoyed it.</i>

19:43.557 --> 19:44.729
I need to get some food.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.852
Claire, wait.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.689
Claire, wait!

19:50.690 --> 19:51.907
Hey!

19:54.777 --> 19:57.200
Hey, lass,
if you're still able to walk,

19:57.279 --> 19:59.247
Jamie isna doing his duty by ye!

19:59.323 --> 20:01.542
If she's worn you out already, Jamie,

20:01.617 --> 20:04.120
I'll be more than happy
to fill your place.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.292
Bit of a curse and give us peace.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.383
Better go back inside, Sassenach.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.634
Until they've had their fun,
they'll no leave us alone.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.898
Jamie, how was your first time?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.528
Did ye bleed?

20:34.608 --> 20:37.737
No, but you will, you bugger,
if ye dinna haud yer wheesht.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.242
Hey, while you're filling your face,

20:39.321 --> 20:41.744
maybe I'll go upstairs
and fill mine, hey?

20:41.824 --> 20:44.452
Maybe...
Maybe I'll fill it with my fist, huh?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.456
All right, lads, shows over.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.382
Dinna need to stay up any longer.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.088
Aye, but let's hope you do.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.839
Why don't you buy yourself
a wedding night like Ned did?

20:57.006 --> 20:59.008
It's the only way he'll ever get one.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.768
Thank you.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.637
Don't think ye've
thanked me properly.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.693
For finding you
somewhere better to stick yer cock

21:08.768 --> 21:10.520
than the fillies in the stable.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.233
Thank you. Truly.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.199
Come on, sit yourself down awhile.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.867
You don't want to appear
too keen to return to your...

21:25.034 --> 21:26.536
Your bride.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.834
Did he really say that?

21:29.914 --> 21:31.962
Aye, he said,
"You never want to let a woman see

21:32.124 --> 21:34.422
"you're too eager to please her.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.592
"Gives her too much power."

21:38.631 --> 21:39.848
Really?

21:41.342 --> 21:43.219
And what did you have to say to that?

21:45.888 --> 21:47.640
I said I was completely
under yer power

21:47.723 --> 21:49.566
and happy to be there.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.403
Is there any more whiskey?

22:04.073 --> 22:05.245
Always.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.639
Thank you.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.153
Sorry.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.177
What does that mean?

23:07.595 --> 23:09.472
"My brown-haired lass."

23:12.600 --> 23:14.443
Rather a dull color,
brown, I've always thought.

23:14.518 --> 23:15.895
No.

23:16.270 --> 23:18.022
No, not dull at all.

23:20.274 --> 23:23.744
It's like the... The water in a burn,

23:25.279 --> 23:27.327
the way it ruffles down the rocks.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.203
Dark in the wavy spots with...

23:35.581 --> 23:39.506
Wee bits of auburn
when the sun touches it.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.184
I see...

23:56.685 --> 23:58.687
See a new kilt for the occasion.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.281
Aye.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.448
The Fraser colors.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.748
Where did you get it?

24:16.872 --> 24:18.044
Did it cost you dear?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.966
It cost nothing
but time and conversation.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.262
The clothes belonged
to the husband of a Fraser widow

24:24.338 --> 24:25.806
about five miles from here.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.808
Died about 10 years ago.

24:27.925 --> 24:31.725
I wager she talked the poor
bugger into an early grave.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.061
She wants them back
by tomorrow night.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.892
- Why?
- I didna ask.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.983
I almost didn't bring the damn
things back to you anyway.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.731
The village is crawling
with Redcoats.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.361
I'm well aware.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.573
Otherwise I'd be
collecting my own wedding clothes.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.654
And what do you think would happen

24:48.737 --> 24:50.114
when you prance out of here

24:50.197 --> 24:52.916
with your red hair and your muckle
size wearing Fraser colors?

24:54.326 --> 24:57.000
You might as well paint
a target on your back.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.842
I plan to be wed
but one time, Murtagh.

25:04.128 --> 25:08.554
So I'll do so in a way
that would make my mother proud.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.265
Hud.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.601
What do you make of her?

25:20.144 --> 25:21.896
Mistress Beauchamp.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.656
She'll do.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.620
I think my mother
would have approved.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.242
Do I look like a gypsy to you?

25:36.243 --> 25:38.496
Able to commune with the spirits?

25:50.007 --> 25:51.725
Have you still got your breach?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.909
Your mother had the sweetest smile.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.993
Would warm a man
to the backbone just to see it.

26:16.992 --> 26:20.166
Claire's smile is just as sweet.

26:23.832 --> 26:24.958
Here.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.181
Murtagh said that?

26:36.220 --> 26:39.349
I wouldn't have expected
anything quite so romantic.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.982
Still waters run deep, ye ken?

26:46.855 --> 26:49.449
Is he a Fraser or a MacKenzie?

26:52.027 --> 26:55.201
Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser.

26:58.992 --> 27:02.713
I'm surprised Dougal waited
for him to go get your kilt.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.716
He was in such a hurry.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.135
He was, but I slowed him down.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.673
I'll do it.

27:16.009 --> 27:19.058
But I have three conditions.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.769
Christ, it would be easier
if I kill ye both.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.684
Much harder to explain.

27:24.059 --> 27:27.359
First, we must be wed properly.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.233
In a church.

27:31.775 --> 27:32.867
Before a priest.

27:38.907 --> 27:41.035
Half past 10:00.
And this one still burrowing

27:41.118 --> 27:42.711
under his blankets.

27:43.912 --> 27:44.913
Christ, father!

27:44.997 --> 27:47.170
Did I no just tell you
to aim it off to the side?

27:47.249 --> 27:49.297
There'd be no problem
if he had left me in my bed.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.344
We only need your
services for an hour,

27:51.420 --> 27:53.593
then you can coorie back
doon under your blankets.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.800
- He says he won't do it.
- That is no what I said.

27:57.593 --> 27:58.890
I said I canna perform a wedding

27:58.969 --> 28:01.188
until after the banns have been read.

28:01.263 --> 28:02.560
But that would take three weeks.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.016
We don't have three days.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.067
Then I won't be
performing your wedding.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.566
I have a knife, too,

28:12.649 --> 28:13.866
and I'm no afraid to use it.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.070
I believe we have you
outnumbered, Father.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.989
Aye, but neither of ye a priest.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.201
Kill me, and you have no one
for miles around

28:22.284 --> 28:23.627
to perform a wedding.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.791
"Till I come,
give attendance to reading,

28:28.957 --> 28:32.052
"to exhortation and to doctrine."

28:32.127 --> 28:35.552
1 Timothy' chapter 4, verse 13.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.683
Church doctrine says before
there can be any wedding,

28:38.800 --> 28:41.394
the names of the contracted
parties must be publicly

28:41.470 --> 28:43.893
announced three times
on three consecutive...

28:43.972 --> 28:46.225
Look, you dozy smout...

28:49.061 --> 28:52.986
"Yer not under the law...
But under grace."

28:54.483 --> 28:55.860
Romans 6:14.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.035
If you'd learned
your catechism from Father Bain,

29:01.114 --> 29:02.457
you'd ken your Bible verses, too.

29:02.532 --> 29:06.082
"Take heed unto thyself,
and unto the doctrine.

29:06.161 --> 29:09.756
"Continue in them, for in
doing this thou shalt both

29:09.831 --> 29:12.675
"save thyself
and them that hear thee."

29:13.335 --> 29:17.511
1 Timothy' chapter 4, verse 16.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.432
"Be not forgetful
to entertain strangers,

29:19.508 --> 29:22.808
"for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares."

29:23.512 --> 29:25.685
"Be not carried about with
divers and strange doctrines."

29:25.764 --> 29:27.562
- You're mixing up the verses.
- It's all Hebrews.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.518
- Well, ye canna do that.
- Enough!

29:32.562 --> 29:34.405
It's colder
than a witch's tit in here.

29:34.648 --> 29:36.070
Ye'll perform the ceremony tomorrow,

29:36.149 --> 29:38.652
banns or no' or you'll
be performing your last rite.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.659
Go ahead, kill me.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.453
Even if I burn in the fiery pit,

29:44.574 --> 29:46.201
it'd be better than
spending one more Sunday

29:46.285 --> 29:48.003
in this miserable freezing box.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.002
How would you like
your own proper windows?

29:56.712 --> 29:59.135
Dougal said that
the wee man barely skipped a beat

29:59.214 --> 30:00.716
before asking what time

30:00.799 --> 30:02.767
we would like the ceremony to begin.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.721
Church and money,
some things don't change.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.021
Here.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.110
What was your next condition?

30:16.440 --> 30:18.067
If ye'd have let me finish the game,

30:18.150 --> 30:19.823
I woulda won us a proper ring.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.278
Well, this is what Jamie wants,

30:21.361 --> 30:23.739
and since it's his wedding,
this is what he'll get.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.496
Good day to you.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.748
Good day.

30:29.036 --> 30:30.583
Are you the blacksmith?

30:31.204 --> 30:33.582
Of course he's
the blacksmith, ye great gob.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.220
We want a ring made.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.764
- A wedding ring.
- For a lass.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.637
- Can you do it?
- A wedding ring?

30:43.550 --> 30:44.767
I suppose.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.015
I've got some silver in the back.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.892
No. Make it from this.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.650
It's a perfectly good key.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.023
It would be a shame
to melt that down.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.319
Dinna melt it down.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.739
The groom wants you to keep the...

30:59.024 --> 31:02.028
The part that goes into the lock

31:02.903 --> 31:04.780
and... The...

31:05.906 --> 31:07.624
Part on the other end.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.625
The blade and the bow.

31:09.701 --> 31:13.581
- Aye, the blade and the bow.
- You didna ken that.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.798
Aye.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.501
It can be done.

31:17.584 --> 31:18.927
Next week.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.843
- Today.
- It'll cost ye.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.262
Gie him the money.

31:34.476 --> 31:35.477
All right.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.355
Ye said ye'd pay half.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.406
I would have, had you not
taken me out of the game.

31:40.482 --> 31:41.483
A key.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.532
Key to what?

31:50.450 --> 31:51.667
Nothing.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.624
It was just something
I had in my sporran.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.794
What was your third condition?

32:03.839 --> 32:05.341
I left that to Ned.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.347
What about this one? Do you like it?

32:08.552 --> 32:10.099
Mistress, please.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.146
I'm here to
find a dress, not a woman.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.439
I like this one.

32:13.515 --> 32:14.937
This one's my favorite color.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.689
Do you like it?

32:17.018 --> 32:18.941
Look what it does at the back.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.363
It laces up.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.533
Do you want this one, then?

32:23.859 --> 32:28.035
Wouldn't you like
to take me out of this one?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.244
The bride isn't a...

32:33.493 --> 32:36.292
- A woman of loose morals?
- Aye, yes.

32:36.455 --> 32:40.551
She can't be wearing that
on her wedding day.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.048
Then mebbe ye shouldn't
be shopping for a dress

32:43.128 --> 32:45.005
at a whorehouse.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.057
I hae something might suit ye.

32:47.841 --> 32:49.843
Get back, back now.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.803
Or I'll clout your ears for ye.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.691
Courtesy of a certain lord
with whom we are familiar.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.894
His lordship bought it
in London for his lady.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.813
On his way home, he lost
the rest of his money

33:01.897 --> 33:03.114
at the tables in Stirling,

33:03.190 --> 33:05.033
so when he came by us
for his usual visit,

33:05.400 --> 33:09.246
he was long on desire
but a wee bit short on clink.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.789
He proposed a trade and I accepted.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.833
Never been worn.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.122
Was waiting for a gentleman

33:15.202 --> 33:17.500
to visit before putting it on,

33:17.579 --> 33:19.752
but I suppose it's best I never did.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.167
No lass should wear
another woman's dress

33:22.250 --> 33:23.593
on her wedding day.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.296
Well, that'll do nicely.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.973
Cost ye a shilling.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.477
Fine, fine, fine.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.102
Must you run off straight away?

33:41.186 --> 33:44.190
It will take the girls
a few minutes to wrap it up.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.609
Protect it from the weather, ye ken?

33:46.816 --> 33:50.662
Perhaps we could offer ye
some entertainment in the meantime?

33:57.202 --> 33:59.876
- Come on.
- Now, just slowly.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.331
Not too fast.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.342
Oh, come on.
Now you're just making things up.

34:04.417 --> 34:09.172
No, I told it to you
exactly as Ned told it to me.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.226
Grinning like a dog with twa tails

34:13.301 --> 34:15.303
and beaming red the whole time.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.478
Did ye not see
the strumpet at the wedding?

34:19.224 --> 34:21.147
- So that's who that was.
- Aye.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.320
I had no idea that
all that was going on.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.946
That's right.

34:26.147 --> 34:28.320
Ye've not told me what
you were doing all day.

34:39.327 --> 34:43.002
Hey, on your feet, lass.

34:43.498 --> 34:46.126
You hardly wanna get married
looking like a melted candle.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.629
Like a what?

34:49.420 --> 34:50.638
Oh, God.

34:50.714 --> 34:54.092
So, do ye no remember
anything of your own wedding?

34:54.384 --> 34:56.603
As a matter of fact, I do.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.189
I did have a monstrous
hangover, though.

35:03.977 --> 35:07.197
<i>I remember every moment,
every second.</i>

35:10.650 --> 35:12.618
<i>I'll never forget
when I came out of the church</i>

35:12.694 --> 35:14.992
<i>and saw you for the first time.</i>

35:17.032 --> 35:20.286
<i>It was as if I stepped
outside on a cloudy day</i>

35:21.202 --> 35:23.455
<i>and suddenly the sun came out.</i>

36:23.556 --> 36:25.308
Your servant, madam.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.285
I can't marry you.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.455
I don't even know your real name.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.455
It's Fraser.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.134
James Alexander

36:51.668 --> 36:55.389
Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.143
Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp.

37:12.522 --> 37:14.775
Well, if you two
are quite finished...

37:15.525 --> 37:17.323
Let's get on with it.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.162
So you don't remember any of this?

37:24.492 --> 37:25.994
<i>Not all of it,</i>

37:27.579 --> 37:29.877
<i>but some things are very clear.</i>

37:53.521 --> 37:58.027
I, James Alexander
Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser

37:58.568 --> 38:01.993
take, thee,
Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp,

38:02.071 --> 38:03.789
to be my wedded wife,

38:03.948 --> 38:07.043
to have and to hold
from this day forth,

38:07.786 --> 38:10.130
for better or for worse,
in sickness and in health...

38:10.371 --> 38:12.465
Till death us do part.

38:12.749 --> 38:15.047
I, Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp

38:17.378 --> 38:18.971
take, thee,

38:19.047 --> 38:23.223
James Alexander
Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser

38:24.052 --> 38:26.054
to be my wedded husband.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.392
To have and to hold from this day...

38:30.475 --> 38:32.398
In sickness and in health...

38:35.063 --> 38:36.940
Till death us do part.

38:38.942 --> 38:40.319
Do you have the ring?

38:40.401 --> 38:41.448
Aye.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.259
Amen.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.497
Say the words after me.

39:39.919 --> 39:42.013
<i>What exactly did the words mean?</i>

39:43.131 --> 39:46.010
<i>"You are blood
of my blood and bone of my bone."</i>

39:49.554 --> 39:52.683
<i>"I give you my body
that we two may be one. "</i>

39:57.145 --> 39:58.818
<i>"I give you my spirit...</i>

40:02.817 --> 40:04.865
<i>"Till our life shall be done."</i>

40:06.321 --> 40:08.198
You may kiss yer bride.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.814
When you kissed me like that,

40:40.897 --> 40:43.275
well, maybe you weren't so sorry

40:43.358 --> 40:45.611
to be marrying me after all.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.339
Take off your shirt.

41:07.048 --> 41:08.925
I want to look at you.

42:22.206 --> 42:23.674
Well, then...

42:25.835 --> 42:27.303
Fair is fair.

42:29.422 --> 42:31.299
Take off yours as well.

42:54.655 --> 42:56.578
Have you never seen
a naked woman before?

42:58.326 --> 43:01.296
Aye, but not one so close.

43:08.961 --> 43:10.929
And not one that's mine.

43:56.092 --> 43:57.435
I'm sorry.

43:58.177 --> 44:00.179
I didna mean to hurt you.

44:02.265 --> 44:03.517
You didn't.

44:05.268 --> 44:06.690
You sure?

44:09.730 --> 44:11.232
Yes.

44:14.569 --> 44:16.663
I dinna know women could...

44:19.115 --> 44:20.742
Does it happen every time?

44:24.287 --> 44:26.415
Only if the man is a very good lover.

44:32.795 --> 44:35.594
But you're so small.
I didna want to hurt you.

44:43.598 --> 44:46.818
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

44:52.940 --> 44:56.194
- Does that hurt?
- A bit.

44:56.819 --> 44:58.446
Do you want me to stop?

44:59.947 --> 45:01.290
No.

45:01.741 --> 45:03.084
No.

46:00.007 --> 46:01.634
What did you say?

46:04.011 --> 46:07.106
"I thought my heart was gonna burst."

47:12.621 --> 47:14.043
Mrs. Fraser.

47:19.962 --> 47:21.589
- You're out late.
- Aye.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.513
I'm just back from
seeing Captain Randall.

47:25.051 --> 47:26.177
I shared with him the happy news

47:26.260 --> 47:28.058
that you're no longer
at his beck and call.

47:30.097 --> 47:31.394
What did he say?

47:31.474 --> 47:33.272
There are
likely limits even to your tolerance

47:33.351 --> 47:35.024
for foul language.

47:36.354 --> 47:37.651
I don't suppose he means

47:37.730 --> 47:39.482
to take any further steps about it?

47:39.732 --> 47:40.904
I shouldn't think so.

47:41.108 --> 47:42.405
He's got more important
things to worry about

47:42.485 --> 47:44.954
than chasing after
one stray Sassenach,

47:45.196 --> 47:46.994
no matter how pretty.

47:47.490 --> 47:49.208
And he's got better
sense than to rile Colum

47:49.283 --> 47:50.751
by kidnapping his nephew's wife.

47:52.453 --> 47:54.455
That's comforting to know.

47:54.955 --> 47:57.253
I commend you for doing your duty.

48:01.754 --> 48:04.633
But it needn't stop you
from sampling other pleasures.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.638
I find you to be the most
singular woman, Claire.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.352
I'm Jamie's wife.

48:29.532 --> 48:31.580
Evening, Mistress, Dougal.

48:31.700 --> 48:33.498
Good evening, Rupert.

48:35.621 --> 48:39.842
I would like to thank you
for your kindness towards me.

48:40.835 --> 48:42.803
The ring is magnificent.

48:43.838 --> 48:45.181
Well, you're welcome.

48:45.381 --> 48:48.681
And a most hearty congratulations
to you on your wedding day.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.521
Thank you.

48:55.516 --> 48:58.736
Young Jamie
may no have much experience,

48:58.811 --> 49:01.064
but that one looks well ridden.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.818
What was that fer?

49:04.900 --> 49:07.073
- Check the horses.
- I've already done it.

49:07.611 --> 49:09.033
Do it again.

50:12.134 --> 50:14.011
They're Scotch pearls.

50:18.182 --> 50:19.775
They belonged to my mother.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.603
And now they belong to my wife.

50:30.778 --> 50:34.157
They're one of the few things
I have left of her.

50:36.784 --> 50:38.786
And very precious to me.

50:41.830 --> 50:43.582
As are you, Claire.

52:20.512 --> 52:22.389
I'll meet you downstairs.

52:22.473 --> 52:23.975
If I don't get something to eat soon,

52:24.099 --> 52:25.601
I might have to take
a bite out of you.

52:25.684 --> 52:27.982
I believe you've already done that.

52:28.103 --> 52:29.776
And I look forward
to doing it again soon.

52:29.897 --> 52:31.149
Don't be long.

52:31.231 --> 52:33.233
There'll be nothing left but crumbs.

52:36.200 --> 52:44.200
