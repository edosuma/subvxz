00:20.253 --> 00:22.788
Oh, hey there, buddy.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.657
Hey, what's going on?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.426
What are you up to?

00:27.428 --> 00:29.328
That's your question?

00:29.330 --> 00:31.630
You a big-time reporter man,
that's what you come up with?

00:31.632 --> 00:33.198
All right, fine.
How many drinks have you had?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.467
What are you,
like six deep right now?

00:35.469 --> 00:37.603
Too many.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.204
Where's your imaginary
girlfriend?

00:39.206 --> 00:41.240
-Oh, ah-ha-ha ha-ha.
-What's her name, Sarah?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.776
Give me that thing.

00:46.112 --> 00:48.781
Ah ha! Now the tables
have turned.

00:48.783 --> 00:51.750
It's my turn
to make you squirm.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.586
How about you start
by telling us a little bit
about yourself?

00:54.588 --> 00:57.356
I hate you.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.324
Uh, what do you wanna know?

00:59.326 --> 01:02.428
My name is Sam Grady.
I'm from Greenville, Ohio,

01:02.430 --> 01:06.165
population closing in
on 15,000.

01:06.167 --> 01:11.136
Uh... I'm a reporter
for our local news station,
channel one.

01:11.138 --> 01:14.239
-There, you happy?
-Why are we all here?

01:14.241 --> 01:16.175
Well, I think you're here
to wish me luck,

01:16.177 --> 01:18.610
send me off in style.
At least I hope so.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.113
Oh, where are you going?

01:21.115 --> 01:24.183
I recently volunteered
to document the war
in Afghanistan.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.717
I've been assigned
to a specific army unit,

01:25.719 --> 01:28.487
and I'm gonna be following
those guys around

01:28.489 --> 01:31.390
for the next few months.

01:31.392 --> 01:34.126
-That's a brave thing
you're doing.
-Thanks.

01:35.562 --> 01:37.429
Why are you doing that?

01:40.133 --> 01:43.435
It's something
that needs to be done.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.637
And I wanna show
all of you out there

01:45.639 --> 01:48.107
who these guys really are,

01:48.109 --> 01:52.244
and not just
what you see on TV,
but who they are right here.

01:56.316 --> 02:00.853
And this woman right here
put this whole shindig together

02:00.855 --> 02:04.790
to send me off the right way.
Isn't that right?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.825
She's the world's
greatest woman.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.661
The most bestest mom.

02:09.663 --> 02:13.398
-Sam, not now, okay?
-Come on, mom.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.167
Say something
into the camera.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.142
-I can't.
-Mom!

02:24.577 --> 02:26.178
Come on, mom.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.497
So here I am.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.166
It's my third official day
in Afghanistan.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.634
Whoo!

02:49.802 --> 02:52.804
The weather has been
insanely hot.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.807
Windy, but hot.
The nights have been freezing.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.210
I've been practicing
digging my fighting hole

02:58.212 --> 03:01.180
from when we're out
in the desert and we need
to catch some shut eye.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.216
But I guess if we're
in the middle of combat,

03:04.218 --> 03:07.953
not gonna be much time
for sleeping anyways.

03:07.955 --> 03:11.790
So, right now, we're all riding
in the back of an old

03:11.792 --> 03:14.359
piece of shit pick-up truck.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.461
We're on our way
to a foot patrol.

03:16.463 --> 03:17.963
It's as good
as it gets, baby.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.432
- It's as good as it gets.
- I guess so.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.234
So we're still on our F.O.B.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.635
- "Fob", dude.
- Fob?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.337
-Fob.
-Fob.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.873
Okay, so we're still
on our fob,

03:27.875 --> 03:30.676
driving to the end
of the wire.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.878
We're gonna get picked up
by an mrap.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.814
They're gonna drive us
approximately 10 miles.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.916
From there we're gonna start
the foot patrol.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.551
I guess, from what
they're saying,

03:39.553 --> 03:42.387
we're gonna be out there
for about six hours.

03:42.389 --> 03:46.491
That's gonna be well
into the night.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.961
My very first foot patrol.

03:48.963 --> 03:50.429
Can't wait.

03:55.301 --> 03:57.736
This has gotta be
the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.738
I mean, look
at these people,
their houses--

03:59.740 --> 04:02.708
it's amazing.
It's so different than home.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.477
You think this is weird,
check out lennie's cock.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.679
That thing's like a fucking
science project.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.914
That's true.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.749
Oh, I'm good, thanks.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.685
Man, you call it weird,
i call it unique.

04:13.687 --> 04:17.456
That's like telling
a fat chick she's got...

04:17.458 --> 04:19.690
- Go fuck yourself.
- Oh!

04:19.692 --> 04:22.527
Could you imagine being able
to actually fuck yourself?

04:22.529 --> 04:24.863
I would just fuck myself
whenever I liked.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.634
How would that even work?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.869
I'd fucking stick
my dick in my own asshole.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.938
I don't know,
shut the fuck up.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.741
Easy boy.
 You're gonna scare Geraldo up in the front seat.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.509
Yo, Geraldo, who's dick
did you have to suck

04:37.511 --> 04:39.645
- to ride shotgun, anyway?
- For real.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.980
I give a pretty mean bj
to somebody riding up there,

04:41.982 --> 04:43.815
and I've never
gotten to ride shotgun.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.518
Oh, my god, you guys always
make gay comments.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.819
Yeah, pretty much.

05:13.614 --> 05:14.813
Hey, do you wanna shut
your fucking hole

05:14.815 --> 05:17.482
back there, please?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.918
Jesus Christ.

05:48.014 --> 05:52.117
All right, let's take five.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.086
All right, men,
you heard him!

05:54.088 --> 05:55.654
Let's take five down here
in this ravine.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.022
Eyes up, boys.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.362
Goddamn it is windy
as fuck out here.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.731
Goddamn it.

06:16.843 --> 06:20.912
Hey, you might wanna keep
your fucking head down.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.681
Keep popping up and down,
you're gonna end up

06:22.683 --> 06:23.915
like those last two
fucking guys.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.617
What happened to them?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.686
Those reporters?
Taliban, bro.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.421
Killed by
the fucking Taliban.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.022
I saw the whole
gruesome thing.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.724
That shit was crazy.
It was fucked up.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.893
-Is he serious?
-Dead fucking serious, bro.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.763
-For real.
-Hey, I'm just fucking
with you, man.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.465
-Lighten up, jeez.
-He's not serious.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.667
Listen, those last two guys
were a couple of pussies.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.936
I mean, even a vagina
would have been like,

06:44.938 --> 06:48.173
"goddamn, these guys
are pussies." Seriously.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.775
I think a vagina
said that to them.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.710
-I think it did.
-Like I heard it.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.880
-Unironically.
-Yeah, it was totally
dead serious.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.115
The pussy was like--

06:57.117 --> 06:59.584
-you don't see that's--
-yeah, I got it.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.820
-Hey, don't be a pussy.
-No, I know you do.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.855
"I don't want a pussy
in my pussy."

07:03.857 --> 07:08.460
-It's his job to harass
a reporter, all right?
-Yeah, uh-huh.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.662
It's so hot out here,
i don't know how you guys
can think about vagina.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.898
All I can think about
is sweating my balls off.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.866
Yeah, no kidding,
it's hot. No doubt.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.872
- What?
- What's going on?

07:20.874 --> 07:22.541
What's going on?

07:22.543 --> 07:23.975
Sorry.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.710
Is it okay to tell me
what the mission is?

07:25.712 --> 07:28.013
We're on area
reconnaissance patrol

07:28.015 --> 07:30.649
checking out
this specific area,
looking at the terrain,

07:30.651 --> 07:33.685
seeing what type
of transportation support
we might need,

07:33.687 --> 07:35.987
equipment, weapons,
shit like that.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.557
It's highly unlikely
we're gonna run into
any enemy out here.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.991
It's the bullshit job
no one wants

07:39.993 --> 07:41.626
because it's fucking boring.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.695
It's true.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.730
I'm having a great time.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.866
Nonetheless, it's the job
we've been ordered to do, men,

07:47.868 --> 07:51.670
-and we're gonna do it.
-Yeah.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.738
It's bullshit, man,
that's all it is,

07:53.740 --> 07:56.541
-is fucking bullshit.
-Why do you think
it's bullshit?

07:56.543 --> 07:59.744
'Cause monti knows
he should be out fucking
killing bad guys.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.613
-Amen.
-Amen.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.983
'Cause, you know, anybody
can do this job right here.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.652
My retarded little brother
could do this in his sleep.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.888
Wait, wait.
You have a fucking
retarded brother?

08:09.890 --> 08:12.591
That means
that your mom's pussy

08:12.593 --> 08:15.527
is a conveyor belt
for retarded humans.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.563
Like, it's like
a factory of mass produced
retarded humans.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.266
The hand of god touched
my mom's vagina twice.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.002
-What in the fuck
are you guys doing?
-Sorry, sergeant.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.837
We are on a goddamn
mission here

08:25.839 --> 08:27.272
and you guys
are horsing around

08:27.274 --> 08:29.674
like a bunch
of goddamn idiots.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.676
Are you a bunch of dumb
fucking monkeys?

08:31.678 --> 08:34.111
Stay focused.
Do you understand?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.679
Got it.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.149
Jackson, you guys
hear me down there?

08:38.150 --> 08:39.951
-Oorah!
-Oorah!

08:39.953 --> 08:43.554
All right, one of our patrols
came under some light fire

08:43.557 --> 08:45.624
about two kilometers
from here.

08:45.626 --> 08:49.594
Why aren't we helping
our guys out?

08:49.596 --> 08:51.930
We're not going anywhere.
That's a negative.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.299
We got a young, inexperienced
journalist with us here.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.634
We gotta keep an eye on him.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.769
Are you kidding?

08:57.771 --> 09:00.105
Does it look like
I'm fucking kidding you,
Montgomery?

09:00.107 --> 09:05.277
Do you see me smiling, huh?
Am I fucking laughing?

09:05.279 --> 09:07.712
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.818
All right, listen up.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.120
Apparently one of our guys

09:15.122 --> 09:17.088
got a little trigger happy
back there

09:17.090 --> 09:19.324
and he greased a civilian.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.060
We've been over the r.O.E
a million goddamn times,

09:22.062 --> 09:25.897
but let me reiterate,
no one is allowed

09:25.899 --> 09:28.633
to shoot anyone
who is unarmed.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.202
No one is allowed
to shoot anyone

09:31.204 --> 09:33.171
unless you are
absolutely certain

09:33.173 --> 09:35.574
without a shadow
of a goddamn doubt

09:35.576 --> 09:38.109
that they pose
an immediate threat to us.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.110
Got it?

09:39.112 --> 09:41.313
Hooah.

09:41.315 --> 09:43.348
Good.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.817
All right, let's move out.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.285
-Move out, guys.
-Let's line it up.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.327
All right,
so we're now entering
hour four of patrol.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.662
We haven't seen
a single civilian,

09:57.664 --> 10:01.166
we haven't seen
anything at all, actually.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.001
Guess I can understand
why these guys say

10:03.003 --> 10:05.370
this is such
a boring mission.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.906
At least it's not
so hot anymore though.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.108
Just tired from carrying around
this equipment all day.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.243
I know it's been a rough one
for you, Geraldo,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.846
but when we get back to base,
I'm gonna give you

10:14.848 --> 10:17.382
the fucking best hand job
you've ever had in Afghanistan.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.117
- Oh, stop.
- Ask butch.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.885
- He fucking felt it.
- Fuck you.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.387
Everybody down!

10:22.389 --> 10:24.689
-Shit.
-Anybody hit?

10:24.691 --> 10:28.393
Montgomery, mills,
take security.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.328
Everybody else,
on my command,

10:30.330 --> 10:33.999
- Fan out against
that cover there!

10:34.001 --> 10:36.034
Ready, go!

10:36.036 --> 10:38.336
Move, move, move, move!

10:38.338 --> 10:40.271
Geraldo, stick with me,
goddamn it.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.173
Right here, right here
on the ground.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.109
Right there.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.778
What the fuck?

10:46.780 --> 10:49.080
Montgomery, mills, fall in!

10:51.817 --> 10:54.252
-Engage!
-Fuck!

10:54.254 --> 10:56.655
Were you hit?

10:56.657 --> 10:58.256
Motherfucker,
i got nothing.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.926
-How about you?
-I don't see shit.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.095
I got five straight across.

11:04.097 --> 11:07.699
-Fuck with their heads!
-Watch my back!

11:08.934 --> 11:12.037
Stay down,
that's an order.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.774
-Fuck.
-Climb over.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.078
Goddamn it,
Geraldo, stay down!

11:30.723 --> 11:32.424
Say again, over!

11:34.093 --> 11:38.329
Do you copy, over?
Goddamn it.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.398
-Comm just broke down.
-Fuck me.

11:44.071 --> 11:47.372
Let's find some shelter.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.275
You take the...
Get the hell out of here.

11:52.945 --> 11:54.245
Stay on them.
Stay on them.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.814
I'll take the rear.
Everybody out.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.482
Butch, you two,
get the hell outta here.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.351
All right,
stick with me and turn
that fucking camera off.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.820
What the hell is going on?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.088
What does it look like
is going on?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.322
We're under attack,
goddamn it.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.424
Now stay close.

12:09.463 --> 12:11.029
Come on!

12:11.031 --> 12:13.398
-Get up! Get up!
-Butch.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.802
Come on, move, move,
move, move!

12:17.804 --> 12:19.904
Which way?
Which way? Which way?

12:21.140 --> 12:23.374
Lennie?

12:23.376 --> 12:25.376
What the fuck, butch?

12:25.378 --> 12:27.345
Which way? Butch?

12:28.981 --> 12:31.950
Lennie! Don't lose him!

12:31.952 --> 12:34.018
Where the fuck
is that goddamn reporter?

12:34.020 --> 12:35.186
Right here.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.421
-Geraldo?
-Goddamn it.

12:39.225 --> 12:40.258
Oh, shit.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.131
Take a knee!

12:46.133 --> 12:48.166
You stay right up my ass,
you got it?

12:48.168 --> 12:49.934
Okay, status?

12:49.936 --> 12:51.336
Alpha missing Kramer,
sergeant.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.538
Bravo, missing Jackson,
Rodriguez.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.508
All right, Alpha team,
let's go.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.813
Clear your right.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.182
Hut!

13:04.184 --> 13:08.386
-Watch that.
-Clear!

13:08.388 --> 13:10.889
Stack on me.
Stack on me.

13:15.394 --> 13:18.029
-Clear!
-Clear!

13:18.031 --> 13:19.164
We found power.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.566
Power, lights coming on.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.168
Coming out.
Step it up.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.271
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

13:28.542 --> 13:30.241
Is anybody hurt?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.944
-Everybody good?
-No.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.412
Fucking damn it.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.415
Where the fuck
is Kramer, man?

13:37.417 --> 13:40.118
Let's get an ammo check.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.920
Red, sarge,
all fucking red.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.190
Oh, fuck that.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.491
All right, listen up.

13:46.493 --> 13:50.094
We got a big shit
sandwich here, boys.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.529
Those a & a shitbags,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.932
they left our flank
wide fucking open,

13:53.934 --> 13:56.067
so we are on our own,
understand?

13:56.069 --> 13:59.370
We got three of our boys
still out there,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.206
but we're gonna go
and get 'em.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.307
Got it?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.108
-Hooah.
-Hooah.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.277
Nolan, Skinner!
You're coming with me

14:06.279 --> 14:08.313
-on a stealth op.
-Hooah.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.416
Now the rest of you,
i want you to stand fast,

14:11.418 --> 14:13.084
and stay in the bunker.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.954
Under no fucking circumstances
are you to leave.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.021
You understand?

14:17.023 --> 14:18.990
-Hooah.
-Hooah.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.993
Perez, you're
the designated babysitter.

14:21.995 --> 14:25.129
You make sure nothing happens
to this fucking kid,
you understand?

14:25.131 --> 14:27.565
I understand,
i just think we should
go out there as a squad--

14:27.567 --> 14:31.569
who the fuck told you
to think, Perez?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.271
It's my job to do
the thinking for you

14:33.273 --> 14:37.108
so that you don't fucking die.
You get me?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.444
-Yes, sarge.
-You keep your mouth shut

14:39.446 --> 14:42.113
and you do what you've been
trained to do.

14:45.251 --> 14:47.552
Does everybody here
understand my orders?

14:47.554 --> 14:50.154
- Hooah.
- Nobody leaves the bunker.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.190
-Yes, sir.
-If we don't come back,

14:52.192 --> 14:54.325
you hold the fuck out

14:54.327 --> 14:56.494
until you are reinforced.

14:58.631 --> 15:03.001
All right,
corporal butch, take command.

15:03.003 --> 15:06.004
Let's move.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.605
Later, guys.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.342
Let's go.

15:11.344 --> 15:15.647
All right.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.348
Stay the fuck out of my way,
you hear me?

15:17.350 --> 15:20.418
Crook, crook, crook!

15:21.654 --> 15:24.289
-Guard this door.
-Crook.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.357
You got your ears on?
Goddamn it.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.994
All right, yeah,
let's check around,
see if there's anything

15:29.996 --> 15:31.696
we can use
in this motherfucker.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.200
Ain't got shit in here.

15:39.638 --> 15:45.009
Bullshit I.E.D.'S,
we're fucking right in here.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.591
-Geraldo?
-Yeah?

16:00.593 --> 16:04.495
This is where you
keep your shit.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.998
Make it cozy.
We could be here a while.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.403
Oh, god.

16:25.084 --> 16:29.120
So here we are somewhere.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.688
Now I know it doesn't
say much,

16:30.690 --> 16:35.326
but honestly,
i have no idea where
the fuck we are.

16:35.328 --> 16:39.530
The last thing I recorded
was us making a run for it
in the desert,

16:39.532 --> 16:43.067
and then me just
face planting in the sand.

16:43.069 --> 16:46.571
Shit.

16:46.573 --> 16:51.142
After my camera shut off,
we ran for about 20 minutes,

16:51.144 --> 16:55.113
give or take,
until Nelson and I stumbled
upon this bunker.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.787
It's clearly an enemy bunker,

17:02.789 --> 17:06.391
which makes me wonder
why we're staying here.

17:06.393 --> 17:10.194
I just have to hope
that the Taliban decides
not to return home.

17:12.064 --> 17:13.698
Shit.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.635
I'll report back later.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.369
Over and out.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.413
We made it through
our first official hour.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.685
I did what I could
to make my new area

17:34.687 --> 17:37.488
as homey as possible.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.590
Moved my backpack
around a little bit,

17:39.592 --> 17:41.759
put it in a few
different spots.

17:41.761 --> 17:46.064
I think it looks pretty good
where it is now.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.232
I hope butch approves.

18:03.315 --> 18:07.552
-Can I interview you?
-Now is not a good time.

18:07.554 --> 18:11.289
What else are we
gonna do down here?

18:11.291 --> 18:12.557
All right.

18:22.835 --> 18:27.672
Okay, start
by stating your name
and where you're from.

18:27.674 --> 18:32.210
You know my name
and where I'm from.

18:32.212 --> 18:37.348
My name is Luis Perez
and I'm from upstate New York.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.785
My boys call me crook.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.553
Why did you join the army?

18:42.555 --> 18:43.888
Uh, good question.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.624
Not just a good one,
such a unique one,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.292
such an interesting angle.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.395
Definitely never one
I've been asked before.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.599
Come back when you have
something worth talking about.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.467
Okay.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.136
Why don't you tell me
why sergeant Nelson

18:58.138 --> 19:00.571
shot you down like that?

19:00.573 --> 19:02.273
I mean, you brought up
a good point.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.508
Maybe we should
have all gone with him.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.276
Good point on that.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.911
-I spoke out of turn.
-You can't be serious.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.546
Come on, Geraldo.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.315
A non-ray like me
talking back to a sergeant?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.818
-You know what
a non-ray is, don't you?
-I can kind of guess.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.821
It's a rank so low
we're not even
considered human.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.923
So low we're not even
worthy of a rank.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.591
Christ man, I'm lucky
he didn't shit on me

19:20.593 --> 19:22.226
right then and there.

19:22.228 --> 19:25.530
You mean killing you?

19:25.532 --> 19:29.534
No, I mean shit on me.
At least killing me would have
been respectable.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.802
So you can't speak
your mind freely.

19:31.804 --> 19:35.239
Oh, no, we can,
just not to authority.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.574
It's as if we don't count,

19:36.576 --> 19:38.543
we have no business
speaking our minds.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.379
It's just how it is.

19:41.381 --> 19:44.448
When I first got here...

19:46.852 --> 19:50.354
One of my sergeants,
we'll call him captain dipshit,

19:50.356 --> 19:53.257
was telling a joke
to a bunch of other
captain dipshits.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.793
I thought the joke was funny,
so I laughed.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.895
I soon found out
that if captain dipshit

19:57.897 --> 20:00.264
tells a joke to a bunch
of other captain dipshits,

20:00.266 --> 20:01.933
better not fucking laugh.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.734
At least he better not
hear you laugh,

20:03.736 --> 20:08.406
'cause god knows he wasn't
tell you that joke.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.541
Don't get me wrong,
when I first enlisted,

20:10.543 --> 20:12.376
I was willing to jump
on a hand grenade

20:12.378 --> 20:15.346
for any of these boys,
and I hope they do
the same for me.

20:15.348 --> 20:18.249
But I got news for you, dawg,
ain't nothing in your contract

20:18.251 --> 20:20.651
when you enlist says
your bosses will respect you.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.286
So talking back to authority?

20:22.288 --> 20:24.488
Don't do it unless
you like being shit on.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.723
Even when you're in war?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.892
Especially
when you're at war.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.429
So you said earlier that when
you first enlisted

20:31.431 --> 20:33.531
you were willing
to jump on a hand grenade
for any of these guys.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.433
That's right.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.535
Sounds like you knew
what you wanted to do
for a long time.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.438
Yeah, as long
as I can remember.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.740
This is where I see myself
for the rest of my life.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.409
I mean, maybe not
in a shithole bunker,

20:45.411 --> 20:48.846
but definitely in the army
serving our country.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.849
Does it discourage you,

20:51.851 --> 20:55.453
being here,
defending our country,

20:55.455 --> 20:57.989
fighting for our freedom
with your life at stake?

20:57.991 --> 21:00.758
I mean, at most times,
you're talked down to
like a child.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.760
Nah, it's fine.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.295
You sure?

21:04.297 --> 21:07.431
I said it's fine.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.667
Look, right now
I'm more concerned

21:09.669 --> 21:11.836
with how much food
and water we got.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.472
I don't know how long
we're gonna be locked up
in this hell hole

21:14.474 --> 21:17.308
and I just hope it's enough.

21:19.378 --> 21:20.745
That's all for now.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.438
Shit.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.607
I got five mre's left.

21:49.609 --> 21:53.311
That means
if I'm eating three a day,

21:53.313 --> 21:57.481
I'm gonna be out
by tomorrow after lunch.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.517
That can't be good.

22:08.860 --> 22:12.430
Mason's from the south
and he talks real slow like.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.632
The boys call him lennie
because he reminds them

22:14.634 --> 22:16.500
of lennie from
"of mice and men."

22:16.502 --> 22:18.102
He's not retarded
or anything,

22:18.104 --> 22:21.706
he just has this crazy
unearthly human strength

22:21.708 --> 22:24.608
when you push
his buttons the wrong way.

22:24.610 --> 22:27.578
He's the only southerner I know
who listens to Janet Jackson.

22:31.116 --> 22:34.085
Seems like you're pretty good
at cleaning that rifle.

22:34.087 --> 22:38.356
Pretty good? I'm gonna
tell you something, boy,

22:38.358 --> 22:40.758
before I joined the army,
the only thing I ever cleaned

22:40.760 --> 22:43.427
was my family's chicken Coop.

22:43.429 --> 22:47.498
There was shit
all over the place.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.935
You never forget
something like that.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.704
I would clean this rifle
with my tongue

22:53.706 --> 22:55.773
every single day if I had to,

22:55.775 --> 22:59.944
if it meant I never had
to clean up chicken shit again.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.679
You know, that's one
of the first things
they teach you

23:01.681 --> 23:03.114
when you join the army,

23:03.116 --> 23:05.816
how to clean a rifle.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.618
They make you do it over
and over and over

23:07.620 --> 23:09.620
till you get it right.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.524
You ever shoot a gun before?

23:13.526 --> 23:16.093
-No, I haven't.
-Yeah, I'm gonna
remember that

23:16.095 --> 23:17.661
when we get back
out there on the field

23:17.663 --> 23:20.965
and I need someone
to watch my ass.

23:20.967 --> 23:24.535
Yeah, I've been shooting guns
since I was a kid.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.738
Shooting all kinds of stuff.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.974
You know, my pop
bought me my first gun

23:29.976 --> 23:33.878
when I was seven,
maybe eight years old.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.613
It was a Christmas present

23:35.615 --> 23:39.116
and the next two birthdays
after that.

23:39.118 --> 23:42.820
I mean, that's
the kind of poor we was.

23:42.822 --> 23:45.723
So let's say you have
two minutes to teach
a guy like me,

23:45.725 --> 23:47.725
who's never touched a rifle
before in his life,

23:47.727 --> 23:50.528
how to shoot a rifle.
What would you tell him?

23:50.530 --> 23:52.563
What would you tell me?

23:52.565 --> 23:54.632
You know, 50 years from now,
when I'm old and grey

23:54.634 --> 23:57.435
and I can't wipe
my own ass no more,

23:57.437 --> 24:00.137
I would still be able
to assemble a rifle.

24:00.139 --> 24:03.474
Blindfolded.
But you know what?

24:03.476 --> 24:05.476
It gets so ingrained
in your skull

24:05.478 --> 24:07.812
that it becomes automatic.

24:07.814 --> 24:11.549
It becomes instinct.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.517
So how do I teach
someone like you

24:13.519 --> 24:17.988
how to shoot a rifle
in 10 minutes?

24:17.990 --> 24:20.057
I don't know.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.626
How do you teach
someone to breathe?

24:22.628 --> 24:25.062
How do you teach someone
how to sleep?

24:25.064 --> 24:29.667
You don't. You just--
you just do it.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.570
Do you think we all should
have gone with sergeant Nelson?

24:35.006 --> 24:36.674
Yeah, I do.

24:36.676 --> 24:40.778
Why do you think he ordered us
all to stay here?

24:40.780 --> 24:44.715
People do shit
for crazy reasons sometimes.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.750
You know, these Taliban guys
we're supposed to be fighting

24:46.752 --> 24:48.819
take cocaine all day long

24:48.821 --> 24:53.657
so they don't even feel it
when we shoot them.

24:53.659 --> 24:57.261
You wanna know
something else crazy?

24:57.263 --> 25:00.731
I joined the army
because I lost a bet.

25:00.733 --> 25:05.069
I was 17 years old,
it was my birthday,

25:05.071 --> 25:06.871
drinking too much,
riding around town

25:06.873 --> 25:10.808
with a bunch of my buddies,
and I just got it in my mind

25:10.810 --> 25:12.276
I was the baddest man
in town.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.845
So I bet them straight out,

25:14.847 --> 25:16.881
find me the biggest
motherfucker you can

25:16.883 --> 25:19.817
and I will put him down.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.519
And so they did,

25:21.521 --> 25:26.023
and he beat the shit
outta me.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.992
A lot of people would be mad
at him for all of that,

25:27.994 --> 25:30.027
but every time I go back
into town when I'm on leave,

25:30.029 --> 25:33.664
I still visit him
every time.

25:33.666 --> 25:39.169
Looking back, you wish
you had won that fight?

25:39.171 --> 25:43.073
You know, like I said,
we all do things

25:43.075 --> 25:46.544
for a lot of different
crazy reasons sometimes.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.912
It was for the best.

25:53.952 --> 25:58.722
We've been down here
way longer than I thought
we were gonna.

25:58.724 --> 26:02.293
At this point, I need to take
a break from the interviews.

26:02.295 --> 26:05.763
There's a fine line between
staying on top of these guys
to get answers

26:05.765 --> 26:07.998
and keeping your distance
so you don't piss them off.

26:09.702 --> 26:13.203
Once that happens,
you're done.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.739
You lost 'em forever.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.208
Fuck.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.811
This is some fucking bullshit.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.813
My black dick for
your motherfucking mouth.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.617
That's for you.
My fucking dick--

26:26.619 --> 26:29.286
I swear to god, you hick,
if you don't give me back
my fucking pussy,

26:29.288 --> 26:31.121
I'm gonna slit your throat
when you're sleeping.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.656
What the hell is going on?

26:32.658 --> 26:34.191
Monti thinks we got
a thief down here.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.127
I know we have a fucking thief
and his name is lennie.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.763
Man, you just got to think
of a pretty face

26:39.765 --> 26:40.965
next time you jerk off.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.600
You got no magazine
to look at.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.068
You got no proof
i did nothing.

26:44.070 --> 26:47.037
-I just saw you reading one.
-Man, that was my smut.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.906
You read a completely different
kind of smut than I do.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.941
You read that
Sunday school shit.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.911
Kinda porn I read will make
your dick fall right off.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.112
You're a fucking hick
and a liar.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.814
Fuck you all!

27:04.723 --> 27:06.190
Get off me, son.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.725
All right, all right.
That's enough. Guys!

27:07.727 --> 27:10.327
Break it up.
Break it the fuck up.

27:10.329 --> 27:13.631
Back off.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.032
All right, and, you,
that's enough with that.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.834
-Relax a little bit.
-Hey, tell me this,

27:16.836 --> 27:18.202
who was watching the door
while you three

27:18.204 --> 27:21.305
stand around jerking
each other off, huh?

27:21.307 --> 27:24.208
Lennie, the fuck
back on the door.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.843
The three of you
keep your eyes open,

27:25.845 --> 27:27.945
your mouths closed
for a change.

27:31.349 --> 27:34.785
My shit.
It belongs to me.

27:54.739 --> 27:57.808
It's fucking freezing.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.009
I don't know if you
can see my breath or not,

27:59.011 --> 28:00.944
but trust me, it's there.

28:04.182 --> 28:07.051
It ain't no comfort inn,
I'll tell you that much.

28:07.053 --> 28:11.155
Geraldo! Get your ass
over here.

28:12.724 --> 28:14.091
Come on!

28:20.198 --> 28:23.434
Hurry up, bro.

28:23.436 --> 28:25.903
All right, now that you got
your ass over here

28:25.905 --> 28:27.204
get into this.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.840
Monti, crook, slide over.
Right there.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.309
I never thought
I'd be shacking up with
a bunch of boys.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.722
All righty then, fellas.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.828
This is not his first time.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.297
I swear to god,
fucking Geraldo,

28:53.299 --> 28:54.898
you touch me and I'll rip
your fucking ass.

28:54.900 --> 28:58.802
-You're not my type, monti.
-Oh, shit.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.871
I don't think he meant
to say "rip your ass."

29:00.873 --> 29:02.339
Shit.

29:06.444 --> 29:09.179
-Now it's a party.
-Yeah.

29:09.181 --> 29:12.783
I don't remember
a night this cold,
i can tell you that.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.419
Southern boys ain't used
to the cold, huh?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.454
This is what
makes you a man.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.822
Makes you a man?

29:18.824 --> 29:20.824
I thought I saw
your leg shaking.

29:20.826 --> 29:23.160
Shut the fuck up.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.162
So this is the gayest thing
I've ever seen.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.997
Well, you're welcome to go
in the other room there

29:26.999 --> 29:28.899
and bust a nut
in the fucking wall
if you want to.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.769
That would be definitely
less gay, wouldn't it?

29:31.771 --> 29:34.171
I mean, yeah,
it would, actually.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.006
It would be less gay.
Yeah, it would--

29:36.008 --> 29:40.310
-technically.
-Technically speaking...

29:40.312 --> 29:43.881
Being the authority
on gay, lennie.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.817
He's like our gay coach.
He coaches us.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.352
He invented this.
This is called the lennie.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.053
No, I'm the authority
on other things,

29:50.055 --> 29:52.790
'cause this-- it smells
like a dog's vagina.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.925
So you're an authority
on dog's vagina?

29:54.927 --> 29:59.329
-Too fucking easy.
-Glad you made that clear.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.565
He set himself up
to get fucked up.

30:01.567 --> 30:04.001
Just telling you,
that ain't gay, all right?

30:04.003 --> 30:06.136
It's a little worse,
i think.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.305
What do you call that,
when you have sex
with animals?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.507
-Beastiality.
-I've been around 'em.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.843
I have some more questions
about dogs vaginas.

30:12.845 --> 30:16.346
Hey, crook, where did you
get your name from?

30:16.348 --> 30:20.984
-Just a nickname.
-All right, hold up.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.187
"How did crook get his name?"

30:23.189 --> 30:24.488
And then the little kids clap.

30:24.490 --> 30:28.492
"Yay!" All right,
so, our little boy Luis,

30:28.494 --> 30:31.428
he's a beautiful man,
a puerto rican man,

30:31.430 --> 30:33.997
he graduates from boot camp
and some of his boys come down.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.266
They said
they're gonna pick him up,
take him on a joy ride.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.467
His boys get to the gate,

30:37.469 --> 30:38.836
he runs out,
he jumps on the car.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.370
They go driving
for a little while.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.272
Fucking driver looks down
at the gas Gauge,

30:42.274 --> 30:43.607
he goes "shit, we don't
have any fucking gas."

30:43.609 --> 30:45.209
So, naturally,
they pull over.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.344
They stop.
It's hot as fuck.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.546
So Perez goes inside,
grabs a soda,

30:49.548 --> 30:51.882
cracks that bitch open,
and he starts drinking it.

30:51.884 --> 30:54.184
He looks over, he sees a shelf
full of fucking "playboys"

30:54.186 --> 30:55.986
and "hustlers" and shit,
and naturally he's like,

30:55.988 --> 30:57.187
"yeah, I wanna see
some titties."

30:57.189 --> 30:59.189
-Naturally.
-Naturally, right?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.924
That's not where
the story goes.

31:00.926 --> 31:03.193
-It's not unnatural.
-It is totally normal shit.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.962
And then, so he opens up
this porno mag--

31:04.964 --> 31:06.430
let's ask lennie.
Is it natural?

31:06.432 --> 31:08.532
It wasn't dog dick.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.067
-It was some woman's--
-did I say dick

31:10.069 --> 31:11.468
-or did I say vagina?
- All right, all right.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.270
I'm telling you
a vagina's a vagina.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.138
Shut up.
He's checking out
these fucking titties,

31:15.140 --> 31:17.074
and he's drinking
this soda, right?

31:17.076 --> 31:18.609
A couple of minutes go by,
he's looking at some titties,

31:18.611 --> 31:20.177
pretending like
he's reading some articles,

31:20.179 --> 31:21.511
but really he's just
looking at titties,

31:21.513 --> 31:21.511
he hears, "meep, meep."

31:21.513 --> 31:24.047
He's like, "oh, shit,
i gotta roll."

31:24.049 --> 31:26.016
So he puts the fucking
porno mag down,

31:26.018 --> 31:28.151
he rolls outside,
next thing he knows, boom!

31:28.153 --> 31:30.587
Fucking gi Joe
undercover motherfucker

31:30.589 --> 31:32.556
rolls up, slams him
against the fucking car,

31:32.558 --> 31:34.358
calls for motherfucking backup,

31:34.360 --> 31:36.159
and because
this Latin, beautiful

31:36.161 --> 31:37.227
Ricky Martin-looking
motherfucker

31:37.229 --> 31:38.595
is not white as fuck,

31:38.597 --> 31:41.064
these motherfuckers
put his ass in jail

31:41.066 --> 31:43.066
for the night for
motherfucking shoplifting.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.668
I'm sorry, you tell
this story every time,

31:44.670 --> 31:46.270
but he did steal a coke.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.272
So, he gets back
to fucking base

31:48.274 --> 31:50.173
on Monday morning after
he gets bailed outta jail,

31:50.175 --> 31:51.909
which was not fucking cheap,
as I recall.

31:51.911 --> 31:54.077
We all know,
word travels fast as fuck.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.913
We hop out
of our fucking bunks.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.648
We're just pointing, hooting,
hollering, laughing.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.283
So we started
calling him "crook"

31:59.285 --> 32:04.021
because he almost pulled off
the perfect crime.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.056
-Amen, brother.
-That's right, that's right.

32:06.058 --> 32:09.092
No one--
that's old to everyone?

32:09.094 --> 32:11.595
-Yeah.
-You fucking always laugh
at that shit.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.630
-I did laugh.
-Inside, though.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.966
-That was me laughing.
-I needed real
support from you.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.068
No, that was it.
That was pretty good.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.437
Guys, he's telling
my life story here!

32:20.439 --> 32:22.172
It's good, I like it.
I value that.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.573
Shh, shh.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.577
What, man?

32:29.614 --> 32:30.714
I farted.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.482
That was it.
That was it.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.451
-That was what it was.
-Anything that'll keep us warm.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.453
It actually made it
smell better in here.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.155
You fucking mortar attacked.

32:38.157 --> 32:41.525
Actually smells better
now that he farted.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.962
Lennie, lennie's also
the authority on ass funk,

32:44.964 --> 32:46.163
so he probably is an expert.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.598
How does that rank
with dog vagina?

32:48.600 --> 32:50.734
-Smellwise?
-Smellwise, yeah.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.536
-You know, I'm not gonna--
-and gay smell.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.237
I mean, put gay smell
in there, too.

32:54.239 --> 32:57.374
How is a vagina gay?
I'm sorry.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.209
You can be an expert
on more than one thing.

32:59.211 --> 33:00.978
-Yeah, I'm sure you can.
-Don't limit yourself.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.980
Vagina's not gay.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.549
Just because
you didn't graduate from
fucking junior high

33:05.551 --> 33:08.085
does not mean you can't be
an expert on some shit.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.798
I'm so fucking hard
right now.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.236
This is the last thing
you hear before you die.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.204
Monti, do you know
any spirituals?

34:01.206 --> 34:03.473
-Hey, man.
-No, we don't sing
spirituals no more.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.276
We do a foot up your ass.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.544
That's a fucking hot one.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.257
It's gotta be morning,
'cause all the guys

34:20.259 --> 34:21.690
are picking up their shit

34:21.693 --> 34:24.061
and it's at least
40 degrees warmer

34:24.063 --> 34:28.565
than it was during
our little cuddle session.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.667
Although I'm not fully convinced
that it's morning yet

34:30.668 --> 34:32.702
because I didn't sleep a wink.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.576
Ah, fuck me.

34:39.578 --> 34:43.447
Here is the biggest jerk ever.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.349
Julian Montgomery.

34:46.351 --> 34:50.520
Back at camp, the guys told me
they called him private duh,

34:50.522 --> 34:52.322
because he's such an idiot.

34:52.324 --> 34:55.158
They'd say,
"it's not that he's not smart,

34:55.159 --> 34:56.760
he's just a fucking idiot."

34:58.696 --> 35:01.698
Now I can see what they mean.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.333
To his face though,
we call him monti.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.335
I mean,
we're not fucking stupid.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.173
Nobody likes the guy.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.242
The only reason why
they keep him around

35:12.244 --> 35:15.145
is because he's such
a tough asshole.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.714
He's the bully you always
wanted on your side

35:17.716 --> 35:19.416
whether you like
the guy or not.

35:24.555 --> 35:26.656
The fuck you want?

35:26.658 --> 35:29.159
I was just wondering
if I can interview you?

35:36.234 --> 35:38.535
I hate reporters.

35:38.537 --> 35:42.506
Because we're so cute?

35:42.508 --> 35:45.442
No because you remind me
of chicks.

35:45.444 --> 35:48.812
Always wanting
to fucking talk.

35:48.814 --> 35:53.350
What makes you think I want you
to interview me, huh?

35:53.352 --> 35:55.852
Answer me!

35:55.854 --> 35:58.655
-I don't know, i--
-answer me, you fuck!

35:58.657 --> 36:01.558
-Monti, chill the fuck out.
-Shut the fuck up, crook.

36:12.270 --> 36:15.539
No, no, no, no.
I want you to get
this shit on the camera.

36:15.541 --> 36:18.808
Oh, yeah.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.244
So how's it feel, huh?

36:21.246 --> 36:25.949
How's it feel for somebody
to invade your personal space?

36:25.951 --> 36:30.253
Gets a little
fucking uncomfortable,
doesn't it, huh?

36:30.255 --> 36:35.325
Go ahead,
ask your question.

36:35.327 --> 36:39.663
I said, ask your question,
Geraldo!

36:48.272 --> 36:53.610
What do you miss
most about home?

36:53.612 --> 36:55.812
I miss pretty little
bitches like you.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.248
-Sweet little fucking--
-come on, man.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.883
I'm gonna take our that eye.
You won't be shooting shit

36:59.885 --> 37:01.985
-after this,
you motherfucker.
-Get off of me, man!

37:01.987 --> 37:03.587
Fuck you,
you son of a bitch.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.622
Monti, what the fuck?

37:05.624 --> 37:07.757
Come on! Somebody get this
fucking guy off of me, man.

37:07.759 --> 37:11.294
Shit!

37:11.296 --> 37:13.463
Oh, shit!

37:13.465 --> 37:14.664
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

37:17.903 --> 37:19.736
-Get off!
-Back off!

37:19.738 --> 37:20.937
Epw check!

37:23.675 --> 37:25.008
That's a fucking I.E.D.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.244
That's fucking I.E.D.
On there.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.012
-Defuse that fucking thing.
-I got it.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.648
Get down here
take a look at this.

37:31.650 --> 37:34.517
Holy shit.

37:34.519 --> 37:35.819
I don't know if you
understand English,

37:35.821 --> 37:38.288
but understand this,
we are locked and loaded

37:38.290 --> 37:41.291
and looking for a fucking
reason to end you right now.

37:41.293 --> 37:44.361
-Go easy, bro.
-All right, that's it.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.766
Ain't got shit.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.768
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.404
Hold on one second.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.673
Fucking stop shaking.
Hold still.

37:56.675 --> 37:59.309
-I got it.
-All right.

37:59.311 --> 38:00.944
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

38:00.946 --> 38:04.314
-Holy fuck.
-Help me get her up
to her feet.

38:04.316 --> 38:05.715
Help me get her up.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.055
Okay, we'll take this off.

38:12.057 --> 38:15.725
-She can't do that.
-Shut the fuck up right now.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.528
Jesus Christ!

38:18.530 --> 38:21.331
-How are we doing?
-You got it?

38:21.333 --> 38:23.500
Moving back, moving back.

38:23.502 --> 38:26.903
Step off. Boom.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.772
Make sure she's clean.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.507
Tie this bitch up
in the back.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.008
What the fuck,
lennie, man?

38:32.010 --> 38:35.679
Hey! What the fuck
are we gonna do with her now?

38:35.681 --> 38:37.380
Fuck, man! I haven't
gotten that far yet.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.349
You're in charge,
you better figure that out.

38:39.351 --> 38:40.850
What the fuck, man?

38:40.852 --> 38:42.686
You should have just let me
cut that bitch.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.054
We wouldn't even be fucking
having this conversation.

38:44.056 --> 38:46.423
Listen, private duh,
if we had killed her,

38:46.425 --> 38:48.024
she would have dropped
the dead man's switch,

38:48.026 --> 38:49.626
we'd all be dead right now,

38:49.628 --> 38:51.995
and we would not be having
this conversation.

38:54.932 --> 38:56.433
How are we doing back there?

38:56.435 --> 38:58.668
She's secure.
We tied her up good.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.104
Yeah, make sure you tie
that bitch up tight.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.707
-Shut the fuck up, monti!
-Shut the fuck up!

39:03.709 --> 39:05.442
Everybody shut the fuck up.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.010
She's gonna be fine
tied up there tight

39:07.012 --> 39:09.612
back for a while,
all right?

39:09.614 --> 39:11.848
Why didn't she detonate
that bomb?

39:11.850 --> 39:12.916
She had all the time
in the world

39:12.918 --> 39:14.718
when she came in here.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.991
Why didn't she do it?
She get cold feet or something?

39:21.993 --> 39:23.626
What you fucking mean,
"cold feet"?

39:23.628 --> 39:25.095
She's not getting fucking
married, lennie.

39:25.097 --> 39:26.496
What the fuck
you think is going on?

39:26.498 --> 39:27.731
-Who cares?
-The fuck off of me!

39:27.733 --> 39:29.466
All of you shut
the fuck up, all right?

39:29.468 --> 39:31.101
You gonna blow yourself up
in a million pieces,

39:31.103 --> 39:32.469
you think you're gonna
straight do it?

39:32.471 --> 39:34.137
You'd be scared as shit, too.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.805
Whatever the reason,
she didn't, all right?

39:35.807 --> 39:37.674
And we're not
all fucking dead,

39:37.676 --> 39:40.643
so unless anybody has a problem
with not being fucking dead,

39:40.645 --> 39:42.712
I suggest we drop it
right now.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.648
Graham, guard the prisoner.
Everybody back to your post,

39:45.650 --> 39:47.817
and the next time I ask you
to guard the fucking door,

39:47.819 --> 39:50.687
it means do not let some
vested up hajji bitch

39:50.689 --> 39:52.756
waltz into my fucking
living room!

39:52.758 --> 39:54.090
How did she get through
the fucking barrier?

39:54.092 --> 39:56.126
You don't have
20 fucking questions!

39:56.128 --> 39:57.961
You're off this fucking post.
Crook, get over here!

39:57.963 --> 40:00.630
Go in that fucking room
right there and cry to yourself

40:00.632 --> 40:02.499
until you remember
how to be a fucking soldier.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.034
Get down there!
Jesus Christ!

40:10.441 --> 40:12.075
Shit.

40:45.910 --> 40:49.612
Sometimes there's just
nothing to say.

40:49.614 --> 40:53.683
This is why I came here.
I gotta say something.

40:58.789 --> 41:02.459
Truth is...

41:02.461 --> 41:06.596
We could all
be dead right now.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.867
That is a scary-ass thought.

41:14.839 --> 41:18.508
I don't know
why she didn't detonate
that fucking bomb.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.976
I just know
it'll drive us all crazy

41:19.978 --> 41:21.878
if we try to figure
that shit out.

41:49.740 --> 41:55.078
This guy, he's gotta be
one of the funniest,
nicest guys around.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.680
And by nice, I just mean
he won't fuck with you

41:57.682 --> 41:59.616
unless you fuck
with him first.

42:08.826 --> 42:12.128
-Graham?
-Katie Couric.

42:12.130 --> 42:16.232
-Feels good to be alive.
-Very funny, very funny.

42:16.234 --> 42:19.836
So, you told me how crook
got his nickname,

42:19.838 --> 42:24.941
-how'd you get yours?
-You love these fucking
nicknames, don't you?

42:24.943 --> 42:28.645
Well, um, I was
back in boot camp

42:28.647 --> 42:30.980
and hanging
around the barracks.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.682
A bunch of these
fucking meatheads

42:32.684 --> 42:34.918
started fighting
each other.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.553
And I just wasn't
in the mood for that shit,

42:36.555 --> 42:39.289
so I ran over,
i broke it up,

42:39.291 --> 42:42.725
and then a bunch of guys
started calling me Gandhi.

42:42.727 --> 42:45.061
But it turned out "Gandhi"
was already taken

42:45.063 --> 42:47.163
by the only other
Indian guy in our unit,

42:47.165 --> 42:50.166
and I think that both of us
can agree that Gandhi

42:50.168 --> 42:52.168
works a little bit better
for an Indian guy

42:52.170 --> 42:56.039
than it does me,
so then they started
calling me "Billy Graham".

42:56.041 --> 42:59.208
What's with the old
newspaper there?

42:59.210 --> 43:01.210
Crosswords, man.

43:01.212 --> 43:04.180
You do know they make
crossword puzzle books, right?

43:04.182 --> 43:06.115
-I do know that.
-Okay.

43:06.117 --> 43:09.218
-I do, thank you.
-Just checking.

43:09.220 --> 43:12.956
I just like having
the paper around, you know,

43:12.958 --> 43:16.960
in case I wanna
take a look at it.

43:16.962 --> 43:20.096
It might be old news
and fucking depressing,

43:20.098 --> 43:23.967
but it's something of
the outside world, you know?

43:23.969 --> 43:26.636
It makes me feel like...

43:26.638 --> 43:30.273
There's something out there
other than this.

43:30.275 --> 43:35.244
I mean, I guess that's why
we take pride in little things

43:35.246 --> 43:39.382
like brushing our teeth
or even just taking a shit,

43:39.384 --> 43:44.354
because we all
just wanna feel normal.

43:46.123 --> 43:49.292
Because when you
think about it,

43:49.294 --> 43:53.363
this shit is not normal.

43:56.066 --> 44:00.069
What else do you do to keep
your mind off all this?

44:00.071 --> 44:02.972
Well, you don't really keep
your mind off all this.

44:02.974 --> 44:09.345
I wish you did,
but back on base most guys
just fucking, you know,

44:09.347 --> 44:11.047
read, work out,

44:11.049 --> 44:13.716
play pranks, jerk off,

44:13.718 --> 44:16.719
clean their rifle.

44:16.721 --> 44:19.856
I write--
i write letters a lot.

44:19.858 --> 44:22.091
Also, I jerk off.

44:22.093 --> 44:26.195
-Naturally.
-But don't tell
anybody that because--

44:26.197 --> 44:30.333
-in the locked box.
-Okay, good.

44:30.335 --> 44:32.368
Who usually writes
you letters?

44:32.370 --> 44:37.040
My family. You know,
mom, grandma, aunts.

44:37.042 --> 44:38.875
My wife, mostly, though.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.210
-Your wife?
-Yeah, my wife.

44:41.212 --> 44:42.845
-You're married?
-Fucking dude.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.914
You gotta be-- holy shit,
how did I miss that?

44:44.916 --> 44:46.849
There it is.
How did you miss that?

44:46.851 --> 44:49.952
It's my fucking
bling right there.

44:49.954 --> 44:54.323
Listen, well, you're not
gonna fucking miss this

44:54.325 --> 44:57.727
when I show you.
You ready?

44:57.729 --> 45:00.263
Keep it together,
all right?

45:00.265 --> 45:01.898
-Okay.
-Bam.

45:01.900 --> 45:04.033
-Whoo!
-That's a woman right there.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.368
-You kidding me?
-No, I'm not.

45:05.370 --> 45:07.136
-That's your wife?
-That is my wife.

45:07.138 --> 45:09.472
You didn't rip that out
of a magazine or something?

45:09.474 --> 45:15.111
I may have done that,
but then married it.

45:15.113 --> 45:16.846
But, um...

45:20.117 --> 45:21.851
We made that.

45:23.320 --> 45:26.723
That's my son, Max.

45:26.725 --> 45:29.992
He's two weeks
in that picture,
but he's bigger now.

45:29.994 --> 45:33.463
Congrats, man,
he's really cute.

45:33.465 --> 45:35.131
Yeah, I haven't
met him yet,

45:35.133 --> 45:40.803
but my wife says
he's got my personality.

45:44.241 --> 45:47.443
Would you like to say something
into the camera for Max?

45:49.747 --> 45:52.915
I don't--

45:52.917 --> 45:55.118
no, I got--

45:55.120 --> 45:56.986
I got what I wanna say
right here.

46:03.260 --> 46:06.529
What the fuck are you doing,
huh? Answer me!

46:06.531 --> 46:08.164
What the fuck
are you looking at, slut?

46:14.806 --> 46:16.973
Pull your
fucking head together.

46:16.975 --> 46:19.008
Hey, look at me.

46:19.010 --> 46:21.511
Fuck, man,
she keeps staring at me.

46:21.513 --> 46:23.946
Let it go. Focus.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.181
Fuck it.
I'm looking at her, man.

46:25.183 --> 46:26.883
-Calm down.
-Easy.

46:26.885 --> 46:28.518
Goddamn it, Geraldo!
Get that goddamn thing off!

46:28.520 --> 46:30.386
Monti, calm down! Jesus!

46:30.388 --> 46:33.156
Shit.
Fucking piece of shit!

46:33.158 --> 46:36.125
Come on, kid.

46:36.127 --> 46:37.493
You gotta steer clear now.

46:40.898 --> 46:44.133
My first wounds in battle.

46:44.135 --> 46:49.005
It's not a broken bone
or detached limb

46:49.007 --> 46:53.309
from stepping on an I.E.D.

46:53.311 --> 46:56.479
Bloody nose, bloody lip.

47:24.274 --> 47:29.011
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

47:32.082 --> 47:34.016
What the fuck?

47:34.018 --> 47:36.252
Get the fuck away from her.

47:36.254 --> 47:38.254
Don't let her
innocent face fool you.

47:38.256 --> 47:42.258
Did you forget she tried
to blow us the fuck up
a few moments ago?

47:42.260 --> 47:45.394
That is exactly
how they get you.

47:45.396 --> 47:47.129
They look like
innocent civilians,

47:47.131 --> 47:49.866
and they will kill you
without even a second thought.

47:49.868 --> 47:51.467
So for your safety
and for ours,

47:51.469 --> 47:54.070
stay the fuck away from her.

47:55.439 --> 47:58.574
It's been over 20 hours.

47:58.576 --> 48:01.577
I think it's finally starting
to catch up with everyone.

48:01.579 --> 48:03.379
There's been a few signs
of breaking down,

48:03.381 --> 48:05.982
but I think you can see
how being locked up this long

48:05.984 --> 48:07.550
would make you act in ways
you normally wouldn't.

48:10.153 --> 48:13.389
I don't know how much longer
we can take it down here.

48:13.391 --> 48:17.393
But for now, we wait.

48:20.163 --> 48:23.332
Dillon Moore, aka butch,

48:23.334 --> 48:27.103
the newly appointed sergeant
for the time being.

48:27.105 --> 48:28.638
I think he's from Montana

48:28.640 --> 48:30.306
or maybe it's Colorado
or something.

48:30.308 --> 48:31.641
I'm not sure.

48:31.643 --> 48:33.442
I just know that
he grew up on a ranch

48:33.444 --> 48:35.978
that's bigger than
my hometown.

48:35.980 --> 48:38.281
The guys named him butch
after butch Cassidy

48:38.283 --> 48:41.450
'cause they're both
from the wild west.

48:41.452 --> 48:42.618
I think they named him butch

48:42.620 --> 48:45.955
because he can be
one tough dude,

48:45.957 --> 48:48.624
but only when he has to be.

48:48.626 --> 48:51.093
He certainly put me
in my place before,
that's for sure.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.025
Is this how you normally
conduct your interviews,

49:23.027 --> 49:25.494
just wait for your interviewee
to start talking?

49:25.496 --> 49:31.200
What do you fear the most
in this situation?

49:31.202 --> 49:34.670
Okay, um...

49:34.672 --> 49:40.076
Well, what's the one thing

49:40.078 --> 49:44.146
that you think my audience
needs to know about your men?

49:49.453 --> 49:54.590
Um, that soldiers don't
just live one kind of life.

49:54.592 --> 49:56.325
You're interviewing them

49:56.327 --> 49:57.526
and you're getting them
in this moment,

49:57.528 --> 50:02.465
but look at
my guys out there.

50:02.467 --> 50:06.435
These guys have
girlfriends and wives,

50:06.437 --> 50:08.504
kids.

50:08.506 --> 50:13.075
They deal with all
the same stuff
everybody else does.

50:13.077 --> 50:17.079
Births, deaths, you know,
a root canal.

50:17.081 --> 50:22.051
Car breaks down,
birthday party.

50:22.053 --> 50:26.756
I guess that's it,
that soldiers live more
than one way of life.

50:30.227 --> 50:33.696
-Do you have family?
-Oh, yeah.

50:33.698 --> 50:36.699
A great pop, two brothers,
one older, one younger.

50:36.701 --> 50:41.303
All are or were soldiers,
including my grandfather--

50:41.305 --> 50:43.072
three generations worth.

50:43.074 --> 50:44.340
What about your mom?

50:44.342 --> 50:46.542
She left when we were kids.

50:46.544 --> 50:51.147
And you're not married?

50:51.149 --> 50:55.718
I hear the divorce rate
for servicemen is higher

50:55.720 --> 50:58.587
than any other profession.

50:58.589 --> 51:01.657
Is there any truth to that?

51:01.659 --> 51:06.195
I think that
if you're gonna make a career
out of the military,

51:06.197 --> 51:07.530
you are at a higher risk.

51:07.532 --> 51:09.632
Why do you think?

51:09.634 --> 51:11.167
Well, the military is--

51:11.169 --> 51:13.636
you know, it's funny,
when you sign up,

51:13.638 --> 51:15.237
that becomes your priority.

51:15.239 --> 51:18.674
Everything else falls
in line behind that.

51:18.676 --> 51:23.145
Maybe it's not fair,
but that's just part
of the sacrifices

51:23.147 --> 51:25.314
we make in service
to our country.

51:29.386 --> 51:33.255
But family shouldn't
take a back seat.

51:33.257 --> 51:38.461
A wife and kids,
they shouldn't have
to come second.

51:38.463 --> 51:43.165
But truth is for me,
these guys have become
my family.

51:47.437 --> 51:50.339
What's the toughest part
about being a leader?

51:52.142 --> 51:54.577
Living with the consequences
of your decisions.

51:54.579 --> 51:57.446
Have you ever made a decision,

51:57.448 --> 51:58.848
you look back in retrospect

51:58.850 --> 52:01.183
and realize
it was the wrong one?

52:01.185 --> 52:04.520
Oh, sure.
I mean, we all have.

52:04.522 --> 52:08.157
Maybe one that sticks out
a little more than the others?

52:10.827 --> 52:16.332
Look, I think it's important
that my audience knows

52:16.334 --> 52:18.534
the difficulties
of being a leader,

52:18.536 --> 52:20.736
that not everybody
is cut out for it.

52:20.738 --> 52:22.438
What is that supposed to mean?

52:22.440 --> 52:24.907
I think you need to tell me
what that decision was.

52:33.750 --> 52:35.684
A while back I was
with a different unit.

52:35.686 --> 52:39.522
A whole different group of guys,
different personalities,

52:39.524 --> 52:41.590
and we were going
into the city of marjah,

52:41.592 --> 52:42.791
and at the time there was
no real threat there,

52:42.793 --> 52:44.426
so it was pretty
standard stuff.

52:44.428 --> 52:48.931
I was the squad leader,
and we encountered these--

52:48.933 --> 52:52.168
this group, it was,
like, a 60-year-old man

52:52.170 --> 52:54.770
and a woman in her twenties.

52:54.772 --> 52:56.338
She was crying,
she was screaming.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.375
And there was a little boy,

52:59.377 --> 53:01.210
and you could tell
from 50 meters out

53:01.212 --> 53:04.380
he was covered in blood,
and so they need help.

53:04.382 --> 53:06.415
So I turn to
the soldier next to me,

53:06.417 --> 53:09.852
private Kelly, and i--
we called him fozz,

53:09.854 --> 53:15.224
after fozzie bear
on "the muppet show",

53:15.226 --> 53:18.861
because, man,
he told the worst
fucking jokes.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.863
In fact, he just walked
right up to me and he said--

53:20.865 --> 53:23.232
he tipped his helmet back
like he did when he talked,

53:23.234 --> 53:28.637
he said, "what happens
when a pepper gets mad?"

53:30.574 --> 53:33.309
It gets 'jalap-eno' face."

53:35.312 --> 53:37.513
Right? Like that.

53:37.515 --> 53:43.219
"Jalap-eno". Terrible.
That's what he said.

53:43.221 --> 53:44.753
That was the last
thing he said.

53:48.692 --> 53:51.794
I mean, you see an old man
and a woman crying

53:51.796 --> 53:54.463
and a little kid
who needs help.

53:54.465 --> 53:57.366
You send over--
we're supposed to be winning

53:57.368 --> 54:00.236
the hearts and minds
of these people.

54:00.238 --> 54:02.571
We're supposed to be helping
the civilian population.

54:02.573 --> 54:06.775
That's what
we're doing here, right?

54:06.777 --> 54:09.778
So, fozz goes over there,
he drops to one knee,

54:09.780 --> 54:13.916
and he tips his helmet back

54:13.918 --> 54:15.484
like he's gonna
tell them a joke,

54:15.486 --> 54:16.852
it's gonna be all better.

54:19.923 --> 54:22.524
Old man takes a gun and
shoots him right in the face.

54:31.635 --> 54:33.435
You asked me
what I'm afraid of.

54:33.437 --> 54:35.471
It's not the chance
that I'm gonna get killed,

54:35.473 --> 54:39.675
it's the certainty
that I'm gonna lose
one of my men.

54:44.281 --> 54:49.351
So, how do you tell
somebody's mother that?

54:49.353 --> 54:51.453
You trusted me
with your boy,

54:51.455 --> 54:55.958
and I made a bad
fucking call,

54:55.960 --> 54:57.760
and he's not coming home.

55:04.668 --> 55:09.805
You told me that these guys
have become your family.

55:12.475 --> 55:13.976
Does that make you feel
like you're all brothers?

55:13.978 --> 55:16.512
Oh, yes, for me, it does.

55:18.948 --> 55:21.350
Even if you wanna kill
some of them sometimes.

55:21.352 --> 55:24.420
I mean, these guys--

55:24.422 --> 55:26.355
but the thing is,

55:26.357 --> 55:30.359
even the ones you hate,
you love.

55:30.361 --> 55:32.628
You see, that's what
i don't understand.

55:32.630 --> 55:36.332
How is it that
sometimes you guys
hate each other so much,

55:36.334 --> 55:38.567
but yet, when the shit
hits the fan,

55:38.569 --> 55:41.337
you have each others backs?

55:41.339 --> 55:42.671
I mean,
it's drilled into us.

55:42.673 --> 55:47.509
I guess you don't know
they do.

55:47.511 --> 55:49.511
You hope they do.

55:49.513 --> 55:52.514
-Well, I think they do.
-You think so?

55:52.516 --> 55:54.450
That's good.

55:57.420 --> 56:00.055
What are you gonna
do with her?

56:01.525 --> 56:04.827
-Hold on.
-Butch! Butch!

56:09.433 --> 56:11.533
Hey! Hey!

56:11.535 --> 56:14.536
-Shit!
-Jesus Christ.

56:18.775 --> 56:21.777
We got you. We got you.

56:21.779 --> 56:23.679
Oh, my god.
What the fuck?

56:23.681 --> 56:25.881
-Here comes Nolan.
-Back! Move! Back! Move! Back!

56:25.883 --> 56:27.916
Put pressure on it.

56:27.918 --> 56:29.885
Yeah, we gotta
get pressure on it.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.587
What the fuck
happened to Nolan?

56:31.589 --> 56:33.422
-He didn't fucking make it.
-Goddamn it.

56:36.893 --> 56:38.060
Come on, man!

56:38.062 --> 56:39.762
Sarge, get with it!
Sarge!

56:39.764 --> 56:41.597
Breathe.

56:41.599 --> 56:43.532
You're gonna be fine,
sergeant!

56:43.534 --> 56:46.068
Sarge, you are fine.
We're gonna get you
out of here.

56:46.070 --> 56:47.770
You're gonna be fine.

56:47.772 --> 56:51.774
It's not that bad.
It's not that bad.

56:51.776 --> 56:53.609
Keep your eyes open,
sergeant.

56:53.611 --> 56:55.778
Keep your eyes open, sergeant.
You're gonna be fine.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.446
-That's it, in and out.
-You're gonna be fine, okay?

56:57.448 --> 56:58.781
You're good, you're good.

56:58.783 --> 56:59.915
Sarge, come on, look at me.

56:59.917 --> 57:01.617
-No, no, no!
-Sarge!

57:01.619 --> 57:03.852
-No!
-Come on, come on!

57:03.854 --> 57:07.656
Shit.
He's breathing, right?

57:07.658 --> 57:12.194
-Fuck.
-Shit.

57:19.469 --> 57:20.869
Come on, sarge.

57:22.472 --> 57:23.872
Sarge.

58:56.733 --> 59:00.035
What the fuck, man?

59:00.037 --> 59:01.270
We should get the fuck
out of here

59:01.272 --> 59:03.005
is what we should be doing.

59:03.007 --> 59:05.707
I told you,
shut the fuck up.

59:07.977 --> 59:11.680
All right, men,
here's what we're gonna do.

59:11.682 --> 59:14.049
We are leaving this bunker
immediately.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.785
We're low in food and water,
and more importantly,

59:16.787 --> 59:18.787
we've still got two
of our brothers out there.

59:18.789 --> 59:21.790
So we're leaving in 5 minutes,
and that includes you, Geraldo.

59:21.792 --> 59:23.258
It's a madhouse
out there, butch.

59:23.260 --> 59:25.961
-I'm sure it is.
-You have no fucking idea.

59:25.963 --> 59:28.797
You remember ziraj?
Multiply that by five.

59:28.799 --> 59:31.099
It's way too fucking
dangerous out there
for a reporter.

59:31.101 --> 59:32.801
-He will not--
-i can't leave him here
by himself.

59:32.803 --> 59:34.970
You have to, butch.
It is no place

59:34.972 --> 59:36.972
for a non-combatant.
He will only be a liability.

59:36.974 --> 59:38.640
All right, we have to
leave somebody with him.

59:38.642 --> 59:40.976
No, you can't.
We're red on ammo.

59:40.978 --> 59:42.811
Everybody needs
to go out there.

59:42.813 --> 59:44.613
Well, I can't fucking
leave him here, Skinner.

59:44.615 --> 59:46.281
You have to
if you want him to live.

59:46.283 --> 59:49.651
Goddamn it! Fuck!

59:49.653 --> 59:53.622
-All right, here I go.
-Shit, shit, shit.

59:53.624 --> 59:56.058
All right, Geraldo,

59:56.060 --> 59:57.960
- you're staying here.
- What?

59:57.962 --> 01:00:00.963
-No questions.
-We had an agreement, okay?

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:03.098
I stay with you guys.
I document this war.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.801
-I said no questions.
-I'm not asking any
fucking questions.

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:07.636
What part of goddamn
no questions

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:10.872
don't you understand?
I said no questions!

01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:12.874
I thought you journalists
were supposed to be smart!

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:16.078
All right, okay!
He fucking stays, all right?

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.948
It's done.
Let's go get our shit.
Come on. Come on.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:23.952
We're leaving in 5 minutes
as soon as that fighting
out there dies down,

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.021
so everybody
get fucking ready.

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:30.092
Fuck this.
I'm going with you guys.

01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:32.961
You listen to me now.
You get a free pass right now

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:35.397
because you haven't
been doing this shit
as long as we have.

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:37.232
But when you're in a war,
i don't care

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:39.234
if you're a soldier
or a lonely fucking reporter,

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:41.236
you listen to the one
who's in command,

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:44.006
and this one
is fucking telling you
you are staying here.

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:48.310
We're coming back
for you, okay?

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.314
Just fucking
hold your ground.

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:25.847
This decision
is such bullshit.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:28.016
I stay here,
they go out there--

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.218
leaving me all by myself?

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.920
Geraldo?

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:38.160
Yeah, um...

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:40.929
I wanna get a second chance
at my interview now.

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:49.337
Yeah, sure, okay.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:54.042
I mean, a little bit
more privacy...

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:57.846
-And no camera.
-But I have to document this.

01:01:57.848 --> 01:02:00.015
Look, I don't care
who you're filming,

01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:03.985
but I'm saying I just
don't wanna be seen saying it.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:19.401
Okay, why now?

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:23.772
Why all of a sudden
this change of heart?

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:29.411
What are you
feeling right now?

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:31.847
-I'm fucking pissed.
-I can see that.

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:39.755
Look, we got some
fucked up r.O.E.'S., man.

01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:43.925
Rules of engagement?

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:47.763
I mean, who would have
ever thought that there
would be rules

01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:50.999
to who you can and cannot
shoot in a fucking war?

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:59.775
No, I wanted to cap
that bitch back there.

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:04.312
Not just because I wanted
to shoot somebody, you know?

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:06.181
Because we cannot
shoot anybody

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:09.818
who is dressed
in civilian clothes.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.821
But that bitch works
for the Taliban,

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:16.925
and I can't shoot her
because she's unarmed?

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:21.129
She was sent here to kill us

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:25.033
and I have the right
to protect myself.

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:29.871
You know?

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:37.145
I see somebody, right,
that I know is the enemy.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.947
I see them
with my own two eyes,

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:42.017
and I know
that he's the enemy,

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:45.821
but I can't shoot him
because he's unarmed.

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:48.890
But he's on the fucking
cell phone with his buddy

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:52.194
up in the fucking mountain
trying to blow up the I.E.D.

01:03:52.196 --> 01:03:54.429
That I'm standing on.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:02.204
We got some
fucked up r.O.E.'S man.

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:07.843
And the scary shit about it,

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:12.447
the Taliban, they know
what we can and cannot do.

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:23.058
You see, these rules, man,
they're not about saving lives,

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.594
they're about winning
the hearts of others,

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:28.163
about creating an image.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.100
They're not about
saving lives.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:38.874
So are you pissed
or are you scared?

01:04:38.876 --> 01:04:40.508
I mean, why did you want
a second chance

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:43.345
at this interview?

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:46.448
Look...

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:51.052
We're going out to war
for real this time,

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:55.090
and I guess I realized that
this was the last chance

01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:58.593
that I might have to say
something important.

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:06.268
Seeing sergeant Nelson
dead like that, man,

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:11.339
it made me wanna go out there
and shoot somebody.

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:13.942
You know, not just
to shoot somebody, man.

01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:17.078
I wanna go and make
somebody suffer.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.214
You know, payback.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.617
And I'm not talking
about that everyday feeling

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:26.988
that I had that I wanna
fight somebody, you know?

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:30.091
I want revenge.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:36.498
That one motherfucker,
i want him.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.568
I want revenge.
That's my friend.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.370
That's my friend.

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:52.681
Are you okay with this?

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:55.517
Yeah.

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:58.153
You know, most reporters
that I see out here,

01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:02.490
they're just
out for themselves.

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:08.330
They'll get they're own story,
no matter what the cost.

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:11.466
So I'm surprised you didn't
put it on me sooner.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:16.705
Yeah, well,
they told me not to,
so I didn't.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.342
But right now
it's just about two

01:06:20.344 --> 01:06:22.410
war buddies talking shit,
am I right?

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.116
Yeah.

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:30.185
You got that right, Sam.

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:33.254
All right, let's go!
Let's go, let's go!

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:37.258
Let's lock it up.

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:40.695
This is it.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:43.164
Look, man,
basically it's this.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:46.735
This is the safety.
Red means dead

01:06:46.737 --> 01:06:49.604
that means it's live.
Do not shoot yourself
in the leg.

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:52.574
Do not shoot anybody
but one of those motherfuckers
coming in here.

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:54.242
You only got a couple rounds.

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:56.644
-Good luck, man.
-Just use this.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:07:01.349
-Red means dead, man.
-See you soon, Geraldo.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:04.486
You're gonna be all right
in here, all right?

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:06.187
-Come on, guys.
-We'll come back for you.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.289
Let's pick it up.

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:10.091
I know this isn't
the decision you wanted,

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:11.693
but it is the one
that's gotta be made.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.428
All right, guys, let's go.

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:15.697
As far as she goes,
as an American,

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.732
I'm saying do what it takes
to keep her alive,

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:20.101
but as your friend,
I'm saying do what it takes
to keep you alive.

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:22.103
-Come on, guys, pick it up.
-You understand?

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:23.438
-Yeah.
-Pick it up.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.739
We're gonna
come back for you

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:26.741
as soon as we find
our brothers out there.

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:29.077
We are coming back for you.

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:31.112
-Move out! Hooah!
-Come on!

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:34.249
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, guys!

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:46.795
Lennie, hurry up.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:42.149
They left me with a pistol

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:46.520
and a woman from the opposite
part of the world,

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:49.256
neither of which I know
what to do with.

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:35.470
Holy shit.

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:38.439
What the fuck?

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.286
Give me your arm.

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:54.622
There.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.480
Here you go.

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:55.516
What's your name?

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:16.371
Don't move.
Just don't move.

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:26.314
Do you speak English?

01:11:26.316 --> 01:11:27.882
I said,
do you speak English?

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.686
Hey! What!

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:34.989
Sit. Shit.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.658
Oh, shit.

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.725
Fucking shit!

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:40.328
Oh, my god.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:42.563
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:44.932
The fucking guys
were right. Fuck!

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.401
Shit.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:55.977
If you'd just--
just come back.

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:03.685
We found that when
we first got here.

01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:06.387
You never put a koran
on the floor.

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.998
Will you just-- will you
tell me something?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.833
Anything?

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.435
Tell me your name.

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:27.041
Hey, sit down!

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:31.679
Sit down.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.414
Please.

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:43.891
What's your name?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.768
My name is Sam.

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:02.844
My name is zarmina.

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:14.422
It's been an hour
since you told me your name,

01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:18.526
but whenever you're ready.

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.544
What is that?

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:43.785
These are babies' bones.

01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:45.052
What?

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:54.729
Sam.

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:57.498
Holy shit!

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:08.876
Sam, please be gentle.

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:11.879
It's okay. I got it.

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:22.590
Oh, my god.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:36.237
Have you ever known
a child who died?

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:40.508
No. Have you?

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.477
Yes, too many.

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.715
What are we gonna do?

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.086
We pray.

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:09.737
You know there are two
different types of tears--

01:15:09.739 --> 01:15:12.874
regular tears

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:14.609
and tears
when you lose a child.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:19.080
They are very different
types of tears.

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:33.194
It's been 30 hours.

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:37.532
It's a personal record for me.

01:15:37.534 --> 01:15:39.901
One time I had the flu
and my mom,

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:42.570
she made me stay home
for 24 hours straight.

01:15:42.572 --> 01:15:44.305
I went crazy.

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:46.807
I had the worst case
of cabin fever.

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:08.629
Go, go, go.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:10.331
Go, go, go! Hurry!

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:18.573
Stay down. Don't move, Sam.

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:23.110
Sam, put the camera down.

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:25.012
Sam, please.

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:26.647
Put it down, Sam.

01:16:26.649 --> 01:16:29.150
I have to. I have to.

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:52.019
Are you okay?

01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:54.088
I think I just need
a minute, please.

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:49.977
About a--

01:20:49.979 --> 01:20:51.979
about a minute
and a half has passed

01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:56.984
since I turned
the camera off.

01:20:56.986 --> 01:20:59.119
I always told myself
that I would never

01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:01.288
stop capturing a moment

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:06.060
no matter how fucked up
the situation.

01:21:06.062 --> 01:21:07.962
I'm not about to start now.

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:15.402
I don't know, I guess
i just never thought

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:18.138
those fucked up situations
might happen to me.

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:21.508
Are you okay?

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:27.047
Um, I haven't decided yet.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:29.049
Do you think
they'll come back?

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:31.485
-I don't think so.
-How do you know for sure?

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:35.022
I do speak pashto.

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:39.226
One of them said
that he didn't see any signs
of U.S. military,

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:42.263
so they'll move on
and probably won't be
coming back.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:11.292
You weren't straightening
things up earlier,

01:22:11.294 --> 01:22:13.594
you were hiding them.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:17.298
You knew they'd be coming.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.434
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.436
No, really, I mean it.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.372
You could have handled
that situation
any way you wanted

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:29.310
I could be dead right now.

01:22:29.312 --> 01:22:31.378
I'm just returning the favor.

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.035
I wanna interview you.

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:02.343
-Zarmina.
-I heard you.

01:23:02.345 --> 01:23:04.678
Please don't.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:09.083
You didn't show up here
with a bomb strapped
to your body by choice.

01:23:09.085 --> 01:23:12.686
If anyone from the Taliban
were to see this video,

01:23:12.688 --> 01:23:15.456
they would kill me
and my entire family.

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:23.564
Look, I don't know
anything about you.

01:23:23.566 --> 01:23:26.567
I'm sure no one dies.

01:23:26.569 --> 01:23:30.237
I wanna know your stories.

01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:32.506
You could be the one person

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:35.476
who changes
everyone's stereotypes

01:23:35.478 --> 01:23:37.177
of Afghans and muslims.

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:40.080
You could change
that whole perception.

01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:41.482
You could be the one woman

01:23:41.484 --> 01:23:44.651
who captures the hearts
of Americans.

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:47.154
I mean, we're suckers
for these kinds of stories.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.459
Tell me why you came here.

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:55.362
Tell me why you came here

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:58.265
with a bomb
strapped to your body.

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:04.571
You're right.

01:24:04.573 --> 01:24:07.141
I didn't come here by choice.

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:32.099
Tell me why.

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:42.276
Yesterday when I was walking
home from the market,

01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:45.712
a group of Taliban
soldiers saw me.

01:24:45.714 --> 01:24:48.449
They grabbed me and beat me.

01:24:48.451 --> 01:24:50.751
They threw me down
on the ground

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:53.187
and strapped
a bomb to my body.

01:24:55.323 --> 01:25:01.295
They told me that
i needed to go to an area

01:25:01.297 --> 01:25:04.631
where they believed
that U.S. soldiers were

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:06.633
and detonate the bomb,

01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:09.470
killing myself
and as many Americans
as possible.

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:14.374
If I didn't,
they would find me

01:25:14.376 --> 01:25:16.410
and kill me
and my whole family.

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:24.351
I decided to go
to a remote area,

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:28.422
killing only myself,
and therefore dying in peace.

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:33.427
I didn't know anyone
was in here until I got here.

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:41.468
As a woman, what was it like
growing up in Afghanistan?

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:51.512
Zarmina, when my audience
sees these tapes,

01:25:51.514 --> 01:25:54.348
I want them to get to know
this side of people,

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:56.650
the side they didn't expect.

01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:59.520
They need to know it exists.

01:25:59.522 --> 01:26:02.823
Without you,
they won't know.

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:07.494
Come on, zarmina,
you can do this.

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:16.937
I remember when the Taliban
came to my school

01:26:16.939 --> 01:26:19.339
and forced the girls out.

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:25.412
As they were pushing us out,

01:26:25.414 --> 01:26:29.316
one of my best friends
fell to the ground.

01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:33.453
They shot her in the back.
She died right there.

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:38.458
I have never experienced
what it is like to have rights.

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:45.966
Do you know any members
of the Taliban personally?

01:26:45.968 --> 01:26:48.302
Yes.

01:26:48.304 --> 01:26:52.439
Two cousins,
and I love them dearly.

01:26:52.441 --> 01:26:57.244
How? I'm sorry,

01:26:57.246 --> 01:27:02.382
how is it possible
that you have two of your own
flesh and blood

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.384
belong to such
an evil organization

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.553
and yet you
still love them?

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:09.890
Some men believe
that the only way

01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:13.594
to provide for their family
is by joining the Taliban.

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:17.631
They would rather be known
as terrorists,

01:27:17.633 --> 01:27:21.235
then see their wife
and children die
of starvation.

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:24.705
Holy shit!

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:32.946
I'm about to introduce you

01:27:32.948 --> 01:27:36.250
to our traditional
Afghan dinner.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:51.465
So the first thing that we do
is we take off our shoes.

01:27:51.467 --> 01:27:53.000
Okay.

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:58.372
Oh! Maybe we should
keep the shoes on.

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:10.984
No! No!

01:28:10.986 --> 01:28:13.553
You never eat
with your left hand.

01:28:13.555 --> 01:28:18.058
Your left hand is used
for your personal hygiene.

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:20.727
You don't want to mix
the two, now do you?

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:25.399
Thank you
for your hospitality.

01:28:25.401 --> 01:28:29.803
Hospitality
is an essential part
of Afghan culture.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:32.673
This is probably the best meal
I've had in a long time.

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:36.977
Thank you.

01:28:36.979 --> 01:28:39.846
You come across as a very
independent woman.

01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:42.482
I'm sure you had
dreams as a kid.

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:49.089
I still do have dreams.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.368
Tell me about them.

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:10.377
Well...

01:29:10.379 --> 01:29:13.814
I always wanted
to be a journalist,

01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:16.950
much like yourself.

01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:21.755
I think that's great.

01:29:21.757 --> 01:29:24.524
What made you want
to become a journalist?

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:30.864
I think civilians
have the right to know

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:33.633
what is going on
in the world.

01:29:33.635 --> 01:29:36.570
It's their world,

01:29:36.572 --> 01:29:39.106
their home.

01:29:39.108 --> 01:29:41.541
Our home.

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:43.977
Our country.

01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:47.381
What is it that instilled
this belief in you?

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:57.391
When I was 17

01:29:57.393 --> 01:30:00.894
the Taliban kidnapped
my father.

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:09.736
My father
had his own business.

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:11.471
He was a Baker.

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:17.043
And when the Taliban
found out

01:30:17.045 --> 01:30:22.582
that he was having my mother
bake from our home,

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:24.618
they took him away from us.

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.088
And for seven months,

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:31.725
we didn't know
what happened to him.

01:30:31.727 --> 01:30:36.029
And then we found out
that they were using my father

01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:38.598
to test explosives.

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:43.136
But that's not
the worst part.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:50.644
The first time they threw him
out into the field,

01:30:50.646 --> 01:30:53.013
only part of the bomb
detonated.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:01.588
But he was still alive,

01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:03.790
so they set him on fire.

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:11.231
My father dying
the way he did was...

01:31:11.233 --> 01:31:13.600
Horrific.

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:20.941
Being a woman
in Afghanistan is hard,

01:31:20.943 --> 01:31:26.880
but being a widowed mother
is even harder.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:31.184
How can you provide
for your family

01:31:31.186 --> 01:31:33.653
if you're not
allowed to work?

01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:40.660
My mother tells me that
Afghanistan used to be

01:31:40.662 --> 01:31:43.263
a beautiful place to live.

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:50.737
Women used to have freedom.

01:31:50.739 --> 01:31:54.107
They could get an education,

01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:57.911
have a successful career,
much like my mother.

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:04.518
She's the one
who educated me

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.620
and taught me English.

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:11.558
And then the saur revolution,

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:16.563
and everything changed.

01:32:16.565 --> 01:32:19.099
Why didn't you just leave
the country like most women?

01:32:21.636 --> 01:32:25.772
Would you leave your country
if things got bad?

01:32:25.774 --> 01:32:28.008
It's your home.

01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:30.977
Why should you leave
your home?

01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:33.813
No one should be forced
to leave their own home.

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:39.052
So that is my story.

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.930
Are you guys hanging in there?

01:32:49.932 --> 01:32:52.866
Okay.

01:32:52.868 --> 01:32:54.701
What about you, monti?

01:32:54.703 --> 01:32:57.337
I'm doing all right, butch.
How about Julian?

01:32:57.339 --> 01:32:58.972
You hanging in there?

01:32:58.974 --> 01:33:01.174
You know it.

01:33:01.176 --> 01:33:03.810
You guys,
i just want to say,

01:33:03.812 --> 01:33:06.746
after all the bullshit
we've been through,

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:08.882
my libido is still
fucking cracking

01:33:08.884 --> 01:33:11.284
and I would fuck
every single one of you guys.

01:33:13.221 --> 01:33:17.257
Especially you, lennie,
that's looking good for real.

01:33:17.259 --> 01:33:19.326
Hey, you keep
sweet talking about that, boy,

01:33:19.328 --> 01:33:21.761
I will come right over there
and fuck your balls.

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:24.798
That's, oh,
that's so gross.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.601
Yeah, when you say that
it just sounds disgusting.

01:33:27.603 --> 01:33:29.269
Fucking gross.

01:33:29.271 --> 01:33:32.005
-Hey, crook?
-Yo.

01:33:32.007 --> 01:33:34.874
What you missing
about home, man?

01:33:34.876 --> 01:33:37.644
Oh, man, watching
good old fashioned war movies

01:33:37.646 --> 01:33:39.746
with my brothers.

01:33:39.748 --> 01:33:43.683
Yeah, you know,
fucking classics.

01:33:43.685 --> 01:33:45.652
Yeah, well,
for me, to be hanging out
on my front porch

01:33:45.654 --> 01:33:48.088
with my buddies,
shooting squirrels.

01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:50.957
Just bullshitting.

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:54.227
I'd say definitely
my wife's pussy right now.

01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:57.063
Yeah, me, too, guys,
put me down for that.

01:33:57.065 --> 01:33:58.832
Sounds good.
You should feel it.

01:33:58.834 --> 01:34:01.901
No, man, for real,
i just miss my wife.

01:34:01.903 --> 01:34:07.240
My kid I haven't even met yet,
man, that's all.

01:34:07.242 --> 01:34:09.943
What about you, monti?

01:34:09.945 --> 01:34:12.712
Nothing, man.

01:34:12.714 --> 01:34:14.748
This is pretty fucking cool
right here.

01:34:18.919 --> 01:34:20.020
Hey.

01:34:22.424 --> 01:34:23.757
To your left!
Left, left, left!

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:30.730
Stay on him! Stay on him!

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:36.870
Now it is your turn.

01:34:38.407 --> 01:34:40.874
You feel uncomfortable
about it, right?

01:34:40.876 --> 01:34:43.977
Okay.

01:34:43.979 --> 01:34:46.746
Tell me how
your childhood was.

01:34:46.748 --> 01:34:48.815
I don't like this.

01:34:48.817 --> 01:34:50.216
Come on!

01:34:50.218 --> 01:34:51.818
This could be
your chance to tell us

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:57.357
what the Americans
are really like.

01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:59.893
So tell me,

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:04.264
what was your childhood like?

01:35:05.232 --> 01:35:07.133
My childhood was good.

01:35:08.736 --> 01:35:11.304
My mom raised me.

01:35:11.306 --> 01:35:14.174
She was only 19
when she had me.

01:35:14.176 --> 01:35:17.243
I know it was difficult
for my mother.

01:35:17.245 --> 01:35:18.978
You know, I didn't have
a father growing up

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:23.316
and I tried,
i tried as best
i could to help out,

01:35:23.318 --> 01:35:29.222
but, you know, as a kid,
you can only do so much, right?

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:31.891
She's such a cool lady.

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:38.364
What made you want
to be a journalist?

01:35:38.366 --> 01:35:42.302
Well, I've always just had
this really strong desire

01:35:42.304 --> 01:35:45.238
to get to know people
and then to tell their stories.

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.008
I want to tell the truth.

01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:53.012
Being a reporter is a lot
like being a good friend.

01:35:53.014 --> 01:35:55.415
You have to care
about your subjects,

01:35:55.417 --> 01:36:00.920
you need to be thoughtful,
and you have to listen.

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:02.489
I mean, those other things
that make people open up

01:36:02.491 --> 01:36:04.257
about themselves--

01:36:04.259 --> 01:36:06.092
am I right?

01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:07.861
You're right.

01:36:07.863 --> 01:36:10.196
I mean, there's an answer
for everything.

01:36:10.198 --> 01:36:12.999
But the difficult part is
when there's an answer

01:36:13.001 --> 01:36:16.870
behind an answer, and it's
my job, as a journalist,

01:36:16.872 --> 01:36:21.541
to find out what
those answers are.

01:36:21.543 --> 01:36:24.177
What made you want
to cover the war?

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:26.946
My dad.

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:29.082
You said you didn't have
a father growing up.

01:36:29.084 --> 01:36:31.518
Well, growing up I didn't.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.187
My dad was in the army.

01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:38.825
My mom tells me
that he was a very
patriotic man.

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:44.164
She says that's where
i get it from.

01:36:44.166 --> 01:36:48.334
In 1983, when U.S. troops
invaded Grenada...

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:53.840
He was killed by a group
of Grenadian soldiers.

01:36:53.842 --> 01:36:56.442
I'm sorry.

01:36:56.444 --> 01:37:00.413
Has covering the war changed
the way you feel about it?

01:37:00.415 --> 01:37:03.116
Definitely.

01:37:03.118 --> 01:37:06.085
I mean, I have a new found
respect for these soldiers.

01:37:06.087 --> 01:37:10.089
These guys they choose
to go out there during war,

01:37:10.091 --> 01:37:13.827
risking their lives so that
i could stay here and be safe.

01:37:13.829 --> 01:37:15.562
I mean, that's something
that not many people

01:37:15.564 --> 01:37:18.031
would do for anyone.

01:37:22.002 --> 01:37:25.338
Those guys...

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.974
My friends...

01:37:27.976 --> 01:37:33.346
Are out there
risking their lives for us.

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:38.017
For me.

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:41.054
And what am I doing?

01:37:41.056 --> 01:37:44.390
Sitting here?
Doing nothing about it?

01:37:44.392 --> 01:37:49.529
Sam, they ordered you
to stay here.

01:37:49.531 --> 01:37:51.064
I heard them myself.

01:37:51.066 --> 01:37:54.167
They were just doing
their job.

01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:58.538
I mean, don't you think
that you would be scared
shitless out there?

01:38:02.476 --> 01:38:04.644
I know I would be.

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:08.514
I gotta--

01:38:08.516 --> 01:38:09.549
what? Sam!

01:38:09.551 --> 01:38:11.417
No, what are you doing?

01:38:11.419 --> 01:38:13.152
Sam!

01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:17.657
Sam.

01:38:17.659 --> 01:38:19.392
-Sam, no you can't.
-Zarmina, please.

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:21.294
Sam, you will die.

01:38:21.296 --> 01:38:24.330
It's not a matter of if,
it's a matter of when.

01:38:24.332 --> 01:38:27.100
But you will die out there.

01:38:29.136 --> 01:38:31.437
I'm sorry, Sam,
you are not a soldier.

01:39:02.303 --> 01:39:05.672
Can you just--

01:39:05.674 --> 01:39:09.142
can you just give me
a minute, please?

01:39:09.144 --> 01:39:10.476
Okay.

01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:48.741
Hurry!

01:41:02.122 --> 01:41:03.756
All right!
I'll do what I can!

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:11.130
Fuck you!

01:41:11.132 --> 01:41:12.799
On your knees! Now!

01:41:13.802 --> 01:41:15.635
Get on your knees now!

01:41:15.637 --> 01:41:17.403
I have a good deal for these
to fuck us over.

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:19.439
But the virgin mother,
dude, fuck.

01:41:19.441 --> 01:41:20.573
The last few--

01:41:22.811 --> 01:41:25.311
-Where has my messenger been?
-I don't know.

01:41:25.313 --> 01:41:29.082
Fuck that fucking
piece of shit.

01:41:29.084 --> 01:41:31.551
Hey, fuck you!

01:41:31.553 --> 01:41:32.618
You fucking pussy!

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:33.619
Where are they?

01:41:33.621 --> 01:41:36.789
I said I don't fucking know!

01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:39.492
I don't know, goddamn it,
you just killed two of--

01:41:39.494 --> 01:41:41.627
don't gripe to me.
Where are they?

01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:45.164
Where is everybody else?
Goddamn it!

01:41:45.166 --> 01:41:47.467
Listen!

01:41:47.469 --> 01:41:49.635
I will ask you
one more time.

01:41:49.637 --> 01:41:51.704
- There isn't anybody
else in front of me.
- Where are they?

01:41:51.706 --> 01:41:53.372
-There isn't anyone.
-You're lying!

01:41:53.374 --> 01:41:57.176
- Fuck you!
- Stand back!

01:41:57.178 --> 01:42:01.447
What in the fuck did we do--

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:03.382
I can't stand it.

01:42:03.384 --> 01:42:07.320
We gotta get
the fuck outta here.

01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:11.791
Don't!

01:42:11.793 --> 01:42:15.428
-Move! Move!
-This is bullshit.

01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:16.762
Move! Move!

01:42:16.764 --> 01:42:19.198
Let's get the fuck
out of here quick.

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.868
-Get up, get up, quick!
-You're fucking walking
outta here, Geraldo.

01:42:22.904 --> 01:42:25.138
Get up, you fucking pussy!

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:29.609
-We're fucked.
-We're fucking walking
outta here.

01:42:29.611 --> 01:42:31.844
Stay on your knees
or I will shoot.

01:42:31.846 --> 01:42:35.448
We got it,
you fucking cunt,
piece of shit!

01:42:36.718 --> 01:42:40.186
-It's gonna be okay, bro
-it's okay.

01:42:42.223 --> 01:42:44.524
We'll be walking outta here
like we walked in.

01:42:44.526 --> 01:42:45.825
I don't know why we don't
get the fuck--

01:42:45.827 --> 01:42:47.226
is he crying?

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:53.633
Face the wall.

01:42:53.635 --> 01:42:54.867
Face the wall!

01:42:54.869 --> 01:42:56.335
Motherfucker, your turn.

01:42:56.337 --> 01:42:57.870
Motherfucker,
take your hands off me.

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:06.212
You fucking dirty--

01:43:06.214 --> 01:43:08.681
I beg you, please.
Please!

01:43:13.221 --> 01:43:15.188
Keep your hands off me!

01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:24.397
Are they awake?

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:49.989
I don't know who
will be watching this,

01:43:49.991 --> 01:43:51.991
but I need to tell you
that there are dozens

01:43:51.993 --> 01:43:55.661
of Taliban occupying
bunkers in qalat

01:43:55.663 --> 01:43:59.265
and dozens more in shindand.

01:43:59.267 --> 01:44:01.968
I don't know where I am.

01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:04.303
I cam hear the two Taliban
that brought me here,

01:44:04.305 --> 01:44:06.005
in the next room.

01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:11.010
If you are watching this,

01:44:11.012 --> 01:44:15.014
you need to find
Sam Grady's mother.

01:44:15.016 --> 01:44:17.683
They're from Greenville, Ohio,

01:44:17.685 --> 01:44:19.885
and you need to tell her
that he loves her

01:44:19.887 --> 01:44:22.822
more than anything.

01:44:22.824 --> 01:44:25.992
You should be
very proud of him.

01:44:25.994 --> 01:44:29.495
I wouldn't be doing this
if it wasn't for him.

01:44:31.699 --> 01:44:34.567
I just heard the door shut.

01:44:34.569 --> 01:44:37.336
I think they may have left.

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:27.753
I hope this reaches someone,

01:45:27.755 --> 01:45:29.689
and I hope it helps.
