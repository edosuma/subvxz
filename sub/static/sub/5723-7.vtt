00:01.525 --> 00:03.315
I've been walking in my sleep.

00:03.360 --> 00:06.155
- I woke up in a drained pond.
- I was right there with you.

00:06.200 --> 00:09.780
You found a rope and a cinder block
and then you tied it to your ankle

00:09.825 --> 00:11.585
and you threw it into a goddamn lake.

00:11.630 --> 00:14.250
And if not for an act
of divine intervention,

00:14.295 --> 00:15.765
you'd be gone.

00:15.810 --> 00:17.190
Why are we losing?

00:17.235 --> 00:18.975
Because they're
giving them something.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.565
We can strip it away,
but once it's gone,

00:20.610 --> 00:23.170
we have nothing to
put back in its place.

00:23.215 --> 00:25.020
Well, let's give them something.

00:25.065 --> 00:26.855
Who wants a hug?

00:26.900 --> 00:28.610
I know you go out
there to pray with him.

00:28.655 --> 00:30.705
Do you know what your father
would do if he found out?

00:30.750 --> 00:31.985
Shoot him again?

00:32.030 --> 00:34.210
My son, Tommy, is he there with you?

00:34.255 --> 00:36.050
No, he's not here.
I've never even met him.

00:36.095 --> 00:38.200
If you do see him,
can you tell him I'm sorry?

00:38.245 --> 00:40.295
I think I just made your
sister uncomfortable.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.200
You don't make me feel uncomfortable.

00:42.245 --> 00:44.630
Have you been noticing that
I've been kind of losing my mind?

00:44.675 --> 00:46.665
I'm letting you handcuff me
to the bed every night

00:46.710 --> 00:48.255
and we're acting like
that's totally normal.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.190
I've been seeing Patti Levin.

00:50.235 --> 00:52.690
- But she's dead.
- Yeah.

00:52.735 --> 00:54.015
What is she saying?

00:54.060 --> 00:56.225
She's saying I never should
have told you about her,

00:56.270 --> 00:58.225
that I just made a big mistake.

01:24.215 --> 01:25.890
She's gone.

01:29.555 --> 01:32.145
Gonna be a hard day, buddy.

01:32.190 --> 01:34.180
What?

01:34.225 --> 01:38.100
She grabbed a suitcase,
threw some clothes in,

01:38.145 --> 01:40.270
grabbed the baby and tiptoed out.

01:40.315 --> 01:42.070
I told you not to tell her.

01:42.115 --> 01:43.520
Bullshit.

01:43.565 --> 01:44.855
Of course she ran off.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.490
I sat right here
and watched her do it.

01:46.535 --> 01:48.410
Barely even looked at you.

01:48.455 --> 01:50.995
If you saw her,
where'd she put the key?

01:51.040 --> 01:52.530
No idea.

01:52.575 --> 01:53.915
Nora?

01:53.960 --> 01:55.870
She's not here, Kevin.

01:57.715 --> 01:58.920
Nora!

01:58.965 --> 02:01.875
That's not her. She's gone.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.045
Shut the fuck up.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.595
Who are you talking to?

02:05.640 --> 02:07.380
- Don't tell her.
- Nobody.

02:09.759 --> 02:11.050
Nora didn't leave me the key.

02:11.095 --> 02:13.435
I think I... Can you run downstairs?

02:13.480 --> 02:15.020
Where's Lily?

02:15.065 --> 02:16.605
I guess she's with Nora.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.725
Can you run downstairs? In my
toolbox, grab my bolt cutters.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.395
You guess she's with Nora?

02:21.440 --> 02:23.060
Dad, what's going on?

02:23.105 --> 02:26.400
- Don't tell her.
- Honey, can you just run down?

02:26.445 --> 02:29.540
They're under the sink
in the kitchen.

02:33.870 --> 02:36.240
I remember the day Neil left me.

02:36.285 --> 02:40.330
I went outside on my lawn

02:40.375 --> 02:44.415
and I sat there until
the sprinklers turned on.

02:44.460 --> 02:48.420
The whole fucking world looked
like all the green went out of it.

02:48.465 --> 02:49.755
She didn't leave me.
She wouldn't do that.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.975
She would and she did.

02:52.020 --> 02:54.675
Kind of didn't leave her any
choice once you told her about me.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.980
You tell your daughter,
she gonna leave you, too.

03:00.730 --> 03:02.570
It's for you.

03:02.615 --> 03:04.570
Where did you find that?

03:04.615 --> 03:05.940
What'd you do?

03:05.985 --> 03:07.940
Just give me the letter, honey.
It's... that's mine.

03:07.985 --> 03:10.130
What'd you do?

03:13.240 --> 03:14.580
Okay.

03:14.625 --> 03:17.700
Jill, stop. Hey, stop it!

03:17.745 --> 03:19.840
Jill, stop it right now.
Give me that.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.725
"Mary and the baby are with me.
Don't call."

03:28.805 --> 03:31.015
So she just left?

03:32.510 --> 03:34.905
No, I...

03:35.980 --> 03:38.270
Jill. Jill, come on. Jill.

03:38.315 --> 03:39.855
I can fix this, Jill.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.610
Jill!

03:43.185 --> 03:45.645
Honey.

03:45.690 --> 03:48.315
Like I said, Kevin,

03:48.360 --> 03:50.370
hard day.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.300
<i>This is Nora.
Leave a message or don't.</i>

05:31.460 --> 05:33.085
Hey, Nora, it's me.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.920
I know you're in town
because you got Mary with you.

05:34.965 --> 05:38.755
I just need to know
where you are, that's it.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.175
I know what I said is crazy.

05:41.220 --> 05:43.430
And... I'm not crazy.

05:43.475 --> 05:45.430
We just need to talk
about it, that's it.

05:45.475 --> 05:49.270
And, uh... just please call me back.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.075
I love you.

05:52.315 --> 05:54.325
I hope she calls back.

06:10.885 --> 06:12.925
Hey.

06:12.970 --> 06:14.460
I was right.

06:14.505 --> 06:15.760
About what?

06:15.805 --> 06:18.630
Told you something
was going on with them

06:18.675 --> 06:20.635
and now she's gone.
She took Lily and she left.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.770
Wait, wait, slow down. What happened?

06:22.815 --> 06:24.770
What happened is my dad fucked up.

06:24.815 --> 06:26.660
Please, can you not...

06:28.350 --> 06:30.610
Really? You want me
to go outside to say fuck?

06:30.655 --> 06:33.530
- Jill, come on.
- Fuck. Fuck!

06:37.610 --> 06:40.485
No lightning bolts, so...

06:40.530 --> 06:42.710
Tell me.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.125
He's losing his mind.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.375
He and Nora have to handcuff
themselves together

06:48.420 --> 06:49.830
every night so that
he doesn't sleepwalk.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.635
He doesn't even
remember where he goes.

06:52.675 --> 06:55.165
He sleepwalks?

06:55.210 --> 06:57.000
And he talks to himself.

06:57.045 --> 06:59.555
Actually, no, he doesn't talk to himself.
He talks to someone else.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.055
My grandpa did the exact same thing

07:01.100 --> 07:03.475
and then they locked him up
in a mental institution.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.810
He heard voices that weren't there.

07:05.855 --> 07:07.895
How do you know they're not there?

07:07.940 --> 07:09.820
Because they're not.

07:11.895 --> 07:14.240
I talk to someone who's not there.

07:15.865 --> 07:17.355
You mean God?

07:17.400 --> 07:19.660
Uh-huh.

07:19.705 --> 07:23.410
Is he the one that's telling you that
we can fool around, but we can't fuck?

07:23.455 --> 07:27.165
Or is that Jesus? Or the Holy Ghost?

07:27.210 --> 07:28.365
I get the three of those confused.

07:28.410 --> 07:29.700
Which one is it
that you're talking to?

07:29.745 --> 07:32.370
Why aren't any of you
guys talking to me?

07:32.415 --> 07:33.870
Hello.

07:33.915 --> 07:35.425
Hello!

07:35.470 --> 07:38.515
You know, I can really use
some fucking help here.

07:41.260 --> 07:44.965
We can't do it because
I don't want to do it.

07:45.010 --> 07:47.270
What?

07:48.350 --> 07:51.140
Listen, I think you're amazing.

07:51.185 --> 07:53.830
But we barely know each other and...

07:55.775 --> 07:58.450
I don't know if I love you yet.

08:03.245 --> 08:05.120
All right.

08:05.165 --> 08:07.340
Thanks for the talk, Reverend.

08:14.550 --> 08:16.160
_

08:22.130 --> 08:24.425
All right, I know this one.

08:24.470 --> 08:25.975
Don't tell me.

08:26.885 --> 08:28.760
Huh...

08:28.805 --> 08:30.765
Hey, I'll be with you in just a sec.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.929
Yeah. Sure.

08:32.975 --> 08:35.600
God damn it, I know this. Hold on.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.605
It's a duck.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.655
Don't tell me now. Is it...

08:39.700 --> 08:42.105
It's a fucking duck.

08:42.150 --> 08:44.075
Is it sobaka?

08:44.120 --> 08:46.030
No, utka.

08:46.075 --> 08:47.580
Sobaka is dog.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.830
Oh, he's learning a language.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.920
Damn it, utka. I knew that.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.955
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm good. How you doing?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.095
I was wondering if you
could help me out here.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.425
How did you do that?

09:01.470 --> 09:02.930
Tell him it was sex stuff.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.130
I just wondered if you
could just cut it off.

09:05.175 --> 09:07.235
Well, let me get a look.

09:10.265 --> 09:11.970
Yes, sir. That's police issue.

09:12.015 --> 09:13.805
Yes, it is. I'm a cop.

09:13.850 --> 09:15.225
Was a cop.

09:15.270 --> 09:17.275
Well, if you want me to pick it open,

09:17.320 --> 09:21.145
I'm gonna have to see your badge
or police ID or something.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.535
Could you just do me
a favor and cut it off?

09:25.110 --> 09:27.820
It was a stupid accident.

09:27.865 --> 09:30.370
Accident? Mm, honesty, Kevin.

09:30.415 --> 09:33.490
Shut the fuck up!

09:33.535 --> 09:36.715
Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

09:38.590 --> 09:40.580
Yeah.

09:40.625 --> 09:42.720
I'm sorry.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.890
Yeah, I'm sorry.

09:53.890 --> 09:55.950
Just trying to help.

09:57.860 --> 10:01.185
Ooh, that is rubbing you raw.
I can tell.

10:01.230 --> 10:03.740
So you got a plan here now?

10:03.785 --> 10:05.105
That's your plan?

10:05.150 --> 10:08.360
Hmm, seems ill-conceived to me.

10:08.405 --> 10:10.580
Maybe if you just,
I don't know, put it...

10:10.625 --> 10:12.970
God damn it! Just shut up!

10:15.130 --> 10:16.805
What do you want?

10:19.130 --> 10:20.840
Sorry?

10:20.885 --> 10:22.760
Why do you keep following me?

10:22.805 --> 10:25.765
If you want me to do something,
just fucking say it.

10:29.645 --> 10:33.135
I'm glad you finally asked, Kevin.

10:33.180 --> 10:36.240
There is something you need to do.

10:39.070 --> 10:43.230
In Cairo, Egypt, there is
an ancient artifact.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.280
It's in a museum now.

10:45.325 --> 10:48.650
They found it in the tomb
of Amenhotep.

10:48.695 --> 10:51.070
Scholars call it the Wishing Cup.

10:51.115 --> 10:53.320
You need to acquire this cup.

10:53.365 --> 10:55.790
It's more of a chalice, actually.

10:55.835 --> 10:57.745
It's gonna be heavily guarded,

10:57.790 --> 11:00.245
but you need to get it
any way you can.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.580
Because once you do,

11:02.625 --> 11:05.050
you need to fill it

11:05.095 --> 11:07.805
with your cum, Kevin.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.590
And then you need to drink it down.

11:12.635 --> 11:17.230
Every last drop.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.825
Jesus, Kevin!

11:26.565 --> 11:30.190
I have no fucking idea
what you're supposed to do.

11:30.235 --> 11:33.195
I don't have some asshole with a halo

11:33.240 --> 11:35.030
giving me instructions.

11:35.075 --> 11:38.500
I killed myself. Next thing I
know, I'm saddled with you.

11:38.545 --> 11:41.785
I'm just as fucking lost
as you are.instructions.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.675
Please, just...

11:45.585 --> 11:47.040
leave me alone.

11:47.085 --> 11:49.630
Please?

11:49.675 --> 11:51.715
You're destroying my life.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.050
You're destroying your life.

11:54.095 --> 11:55.465
I just get to watch.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.720
Please, just go away.

11:57.765 --> 11:59.440
Please, Patti.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.410
I'm begging you. Please.

12:06.405 --> 12:08.335
What?

12:30.430 --> 12:32.725
I guess it didn't work.

12:35.050 --> 12:36.810
What?

12:36.855 --> 12:39.730
It didn't work. She's still here.

12:39.775 --> 12:42.035
I know you went to see him.

12:43.525 --> 12:45.620
You don't remember?

12:48.780 --> 12:51.355
Uh, Michael, um...

12:51.400 --> 12:53.190
I need you to get out of my truck.

12:53.235 --> 12:56.030
- I'm not having a...
- Her name's Patti, right?

12:56.075 --> 12:59.030
The woman that you see.

12:59.075 --> 13:01.470
Her name is Patti.
She dresses in white.

13:03.495 --> 13:04.920
How do you know that?

13:04.965 --> 13:07.140
My grandfather told me.

13:08.835 --> 13:11.845
Listen, if you want
to get rid of her,

13:11.890 --> 13:13.765
he can help.

13:16.175 --> 13:18.855
If you can't remember how to get
there, I can give you directions.

13:22.265 --> 13:24.660
Two blocks up, make a left.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.795
Just wait here a minute, okay?

13:59.555 --> 14:01.645
Hey, Pop. He's here.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.430
Hallelujah.

14:06.475 --> 14:09.435
Well, Kevin, that there
looks like a fella

14:09.480 --> 14:12.455
who's a solution to all our problems.

14:19.290 --> 14:21.915
Michael says you're a sleepwalker

14:21.960 --> 14:25.055
and you don't remember coming here.

14:27.665 --> 14:28.835
No.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.120
All right.

14:30.165 --> 14:32.425
Well, come on in.
We'll go over it again.

14:32.470 --> 14:34.230
Just you.

14:58.445 --> 15:00.370
Three's a crowd.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.250
You remember seeing me
at the visitors' center?

15:15.295 --> 15:17.885
The day you got here.

15:17.930 --> 15:20.225
You recall what I said to you?

15:21.720 --> 15:26.095
You said you could
help me with my situation.

15:26.140 --> 15:28.180
Mm-hmm.

15:28.225 --> 15:30.680
It's 'cause I felt her

15:30.725 --> 15:32.515
clinging on you.

15:32.560 --> 15:37.490
Like that plastic they put over a
plate of food so it won't go bad.

15:37.535 --> 15:40.240
So I invited you over.

15:40.285 --> 15:44.530
You pretended like you didn't
know what I was talking about.

15:44.575 --> 15:46.830
But later that night,

15:46.875 --> 15:49.255
you came knocking.

15:50.415 --> 15:52.005
I can't remember being here.

15:52.050 --> 15:54.540
Yeah, well, you were here.

15:54.585 --> 15:57.175
Sat right there in that same chair.

15:57.220 --> 16:00.015
Talking to me just like
you're talking to me now.

16:02.090 --> 16:06.100
If you were asleep,
I certainly couldn't tell.

16:06.145 --> 16:08.190
Wake up!

16:11.320 --> 16:13.060
I'm not asleep.

16:13.105 --> 16:16.230
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.895
Do you remember what I said
when I was here?

16:18.940 --> 16:20.615
Mm-hmm.

16:20.660 --> 16:24.285
You told me who she was, Patti.

16:24.330 --> 16:27.590
Told me how she killed herself
right in front of you.

16:28.835 --> 16:31.545
And ever since then,
she wouldn't let you be.

16:33.205 --> 16:36.770
Then you asked me
how you could cast her out.

16:39.545 --> 16:41.505
Sounds like a fucking exorcism.

16:41.550 --> 16:44.140
Oh, you people and that movie.

16:45.685 --> 16:49.145
Let me ask you something. You
throwing up across the room yet?

16:49.190 --> 16:51.345
Your head turning round and round?

16:51.390 --> 16:52.815
No.

16:52.860 --> 16:56.655
No, that's because
she ain't in you, Kevin.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.155
She's on you.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.440
And if you want to get her off you,

17:04.484 --> 17:07.329
you can't do it on your turf.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.500
You got to go to hers.

17:14.214 --> 17:16.339
The other place.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.960
How do I do that?

17:21.005 --> 17:23.349
You die.

17:27.395 --> 17:29.970
I don't... I don't understand.

17:30.015 --> 17:34.220
You understood
just fine the last time.

17:34.265 --> 17:37.810
In fact, you grabbed
a piece of my rope,

17:37.855 --> 17:40.395
picked up a cinder block
from outside,

17:40.440 --> 17:43.530
then off you walked into the woods.

17:43.575 --> 17:46.320
I told you you needed help.
You needed a guide.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.985
But you were itching to do battle,

17:49.030 --> 17:51.090
so off you went to do it.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.830
Now, drowning's not
the best way to cross.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.215
No exit strategy.

17:59.260 --> 18:01.415
And like I said, you need a guide.

18:01.460 --> 18:05.170
But I'd reckon that quake happened

18:05.215 --> 18:07.890
right before you passed,

18:07.935 --> 18:11.060
opened up the ground,
emptied out all that water.

18:11.105 --> 18:14.345
Spared your life.

18:14.390 --> 18:17.570
Which means either you got
somebody looking out for you...

18:20.780 --> 18:24.290
or you've got yourself
a most powerful adversary.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.750
Who are you?

18:35.830 --> 18:39.590
I'm just someone who once had
an adversary of his own.

18:42.085 --> 18:44.980
One that made me do terrible things.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.515
And for those things...

18:50.060 --> 18:51.770
I was shot...

18:54.065 --> 18:56.055
in the chest,

18:56.100 --> 18:58.325
in the belly...

19:03.025 --> 19:06.400
and in that foul machinery
below the waist

19:06.445 --> 19:09.585
which transgressed the laws of man.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.545
And when I went over...

19:18.290 --> 19:21.350
I did battle with my adversary.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.220
And I vanquished him.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.425
And then, Kevin,

19:31.470 --> 19:34.110
I was reborn.

19:40.810 --> 19:43.020
Michael's your grandson.

19:43.065 --> 19:45.155
He is.

19:46.650 --> 19:49.240
And his father John, he...

19:49.285 --> 19:52.325
he went to prison

19:52.370 --> 19:53.945
for attempted murder.

19:53.990 --> 19:55.965
He did.

19:59.045 --> 20:01.390
So what'd you do to him?

20:06.920 --> 20:08.730
I hurt him.

20:10.925 --> 20:13.650
I hurt him a long time ago.

20:16.980 --> 20:19.325
And then he hurt me back.

20:23.770 --> 20:26.665
And he freed me.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.790
Now let me free you.

20:41.870 --> 20:43.515
By killing me?

20:46.210 --> 20:48.220
Temporarily.

21:00.975 --> 21:02.730
Come on back when you're ready.

21:02.775 --> 21:04.820
Any time, day or night.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.260
Patti!

21:34.305 --> 21:36.515
Patti Levin!

21:39.010 --> 21:40.520
Where are you?

21:40.565 --> 21:42.355
Are you fucking hiding from me?

21:42.400 --> 21:45.555
You come out right the fuck now!

21:45.600 --> 21:47.525
Jesus, Kevin.

21:47.570 --> 21:49.330
Get a grip.

21:57.245 --> 21:58.735
Where were you?

21:58.780 --> 22:01.425
Around.

22:03.335 --> 22:05.245
You lied to me.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.130
- Sorry?
- Yeah.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.970
That night you said you were
with me the whole time.

22:13.715 --> 22:15.220
You said you saw the girls disappear.

22:15.265 --> 22:16.755
You said you saw me
try and kill myself.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.590
But you left out
the fucking part, Patti,

22:19.635 --> 22:21.780
where I went to him.

22:24.025 --> 22:27.815
So what?

22:27.860 --> 22:29.815
What would you have
done if I told you

22:29.860 --> 22:31.770
that the solution
to all your problems

22:31.815 --> 22:35.405
was a magical black man sitting
out on the edge of town?

22:35.450 --> 22:38.715
That's borderline racist
is what that is.

22:42.460 --> 22:45.585
He knows what you are.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.810
He knows how to get rid of you.

22:58.390 --> 23:01.550
Then why the fuck are you out here

23:01.595 --> 23:04.070
in the woods calling for me?

23:05.515 --> 23:07.770
This man gave you a solution

23:07.815 --> 23:09.640
and you ran.

23:09.685 --> 23:13.530
You think I'm scared
to do battle with you?

23:13.575 --> 23:16.650
Oh, Kevin.

23:16.695 --> 23:20.205
I am so desperate to do battle.

23:21.365 --> 23:24.205
So let's go. Let's go back.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.490
Right now.

23:26.535 --> 23:29.015
Let's go fucking die.

23:34.045 --> 23:36.220
I have responsibilities.

23:38.045 --> 23:39.890
I'm a father.

23:41.515 --> 23:43.860
Maybe Jill would be better off.

23:54.645 --> 23:56.855
This is Nora.
Leave a message or don't.

23:56.900 --> 23:59.575
Nora, can you call me back?

23:59.620 --> 24:01.775
Please?

24:01.820 --> 24:05.550
I need you, so just call me back.

24:07.125 --> 24:09.170
What about what she needs?

24:14.965 --> 24:17.710
- Hello?
- Hey. This Kevin Garvey?

24:17.755 --> 24:20.710
- Yeah.
- Ranger Carson calling from the bridge.

24:20.755 --> 24:22.880
Visitors' center gave me your cell.

24:22.925 --> 24:24.850
There's a woman at the gate
asking for you.

24:24.895 --> 24:27.050
Says she's your wife.

24:27.095 --> 24:30.020
Is her name Nora? Nora Durst?

24:30.065 --> 24:31.940
Hold on.

24:31.985 --> 24:34.525
Are you Nora?

24:34.570 --> 24:36.580
Says her name is Laurie.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.900
Hello?

24:41.945 --> 24:44.450
Is she there? Is she there right now?

24:44.495 --> 24:46.070
Yes, sir, but I can't let her in

24:46.115 --> 24:48.340
without a wristband or reservation.

24:50.035 --> 24:52.295
Who was that?

25:17.815 --> 25:19.735
I'm Kevin Garvey.
You called me on the phone.

25:19.780 --> 25:22.025
Oh, yeah, great. Hang on one sec.

25:22.070 --> 25:23.690
Hey, Kevin Garvey's here.

25:23.735 --> 25:25.445
Could you bring that lady on up?

25:25.490 --> 25:27.610
She doesn't have an or anything,

25:27.655 --> 25:30.250
so you've got to talk
to her at the fence.

25:30.295 --> 25:32.170
Sure.

26:00.070 --> 26:02.000
Hi.

26:04.025 --> 26:05.335
You're talking.

26:06.660 --> 26:08.070
Uh-huh.

26:08.115 --> 26:11.210
What are you doing here, Laurie?

26:12.420 --> 26:14.460
I know I don't have
any right to be here...

26:14.505 --> 26:16.045
to bother you.

26:16.090 --> 26:18.045
And I know you have
every right to move on

26:18.090 --> 26:19.495
and I respect your boundaries,

26:19.540 --> 26:22.220
but I just... I need to talk to Tommy.

26:23.795 --> 26:25.555
Nora told me that he wasn't here

26:25.600 --> 26:28.220
and I understand why she
felt the need to say that.

26:28.265 --> 26:31.090
I... I don't know what he told you,

26:31.135 --> 26:35.595
but if you could please just

26:35.640 --> 26:37.100
have him come see me.

26:37.145 --> 26:41.185
I'm staying at the Prairie Motor
Inn in Laramie, room 114.

26:41.230 --> 26:43.820
When'd you talk to Nora?

26:43.865 --> 26:46.655
Last night.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.695
She didn't tell you?

26:48.740 --> 26:51.580
Tommy's not here.

26:53.325 --> 26:55.700
I haven't spoken to him in...

26:55.745 --> 26:58.555
I haven't seen him in over a year.

27:03.050 --> 27:05.090
's not here?

27:05.135 --> 27:07.095
No.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.880
Why would you even think
that he would come to me?

27:10.925 --> 27:13.185
I don't know. I mean, he's in touch
with Jill and I thought maybe...

27:13.230 --> 27:15.385
- He's not in touch with Jill.
- He's in touch with Jill, Kevin.

27:15.430 --> 27:17.660
They text all the time.

27:23.355 --> 27:27.730
So Tommy, he's been with you?

27:27.775 --> 27:30.085
Yeah.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.960
Is he okay?

27:36.785 --> 27:38.965
He's fine.

27:42.090 --> 27:43.915
What did you do?

27:43.960 --> 27:45.415
What happened?

27:45.460 --> 27:49.225
Why are you here?
What did you do, Laurie?

27:52.050 --> 27:54.810
Are you okay, Kevin?

27:54.855 --> 27:56.595
Yeah, I'm okay.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.730
I'm gr

27:58.775 --> 28:00.850
I'm terrific.

28:00.895 --> 28:03.265
I'm sorry.

28:03.310 --> 28:05.070
I shouldn't have come here.

28:05.115 --> 28:07.320
I'm... I'm sorry.

28:07.365 --> 28:09.325
No, no.

28:09.370 --> 28:11.440
No, you don't leave.

28:11.485 --> 28:13.695
You'reeave?

28:13.740 --> 28:15.665
You don't leave!

28:16.710 --> 28:19.335
Hey, Laurie, fine. Good.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.555
Good, go home.

28:22.750 --> 28:25.290
Go home! Go home!

29:21.775 --> 29:23.735
Kevin.

29:29.730 --> 29:31.625
Hey, man.

29:34.235 --> 29:36.110
You got the flier?

29:36.155 --> 29:38.445
The what?

29:38.490 --> 29:41.030
Oh, well, there was
a palm print found

29:41.075 --> 29:43.365
on the car that the girls
disappeared from.

29:43.410 --> 29:45.035
Figured I'd give all the innocent men

29:45.080 --> 29:47.140
an opportunity
to get on the right list.

29:52.805 --> 29:54.930
But you're not here for that.

29:56.675 --> 29:58.270
Oh, um...

29:59.980 --> 30:01.655
actually, I was...

30:04.100 --> 30:06.575
I was hoping you might be able
to help me out with this.

30:07.935 --> 30:10.860
Oh. Your idea or Nora's?

30:10.905 --> 30:12.565
It's hers.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.615
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

30:14.660 --> 30:16.565
Well, your secret is safe with me.

30:16.610 --> 30:18.070
Good.

30:18.115 --> 30:20.740
Cedric, go grab the cutters.

30:20.785 --> 30:22.705
You know where they are?

30:22.750 --> 30:24.510
Somewhere.

30:26.255 --> 30:28.410
While you're here, you mind?

30:28.455 --> 30:30.295
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

30:30.340 --> 30:32.185
Oh, yeah.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.310
_

30:35.345 --> 30:37.690
Just press it down
right there in the ink.

30:39.635 --> 30:41.510
Your other hand.

30:41.555 --> 30:43.395
Oh.

30:46.140 --> 30:47.650
There we go.

30:47.695 --> 30:49.435
HandiWipes are free.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.850
- Your name?
- Kevin Garvey.

30:51.895 --> 30:53.990
Good.

31:05.410 --> 31:07.500
Another innocent man exonerated.

31:07.545 --> 31:09.170
Thanks for doing that, Kevin.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.175
You're welcome.

31:14.335 --> 31:17.295
No cutters, man. Couldn't find them.

31:17.340 --> 31:20.295
T.J. must have taken
them home with him.

31:20.340 --> 31:22.655
Why would he do that?

31:25.265 --> 31:28.470
Sorry, man. But... oh, you
know who can help you out?

31:28.515 --> 31:32.110
Locksmith right down on Fuller there.

31:32.155 --> 31:34.700
Nate. Tell him I sent you.

31:38.025 --> 31:40.870
Good. Thanks.

31:40.915 --> 31:42.455
Yeah.

31:56.210 --> 31:59.020
Well, that's that.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.425
You went there to get free

32:02.470 --> 32:04.395
and you got caught.

32:06.020 --> 32:09.345
You know, the only time in my life

32:09.390 --> 32:12.065
that I felt truly free, Kevin,

32:12.110 --> 32:14.350
was when I picked up
that piece of glass

32:14.395 --> 32:15.655
and I stuck it in my neck.

32:18.150 --> 32:20.325
You were holding me in your arms

32:20.370 --> 32:24.445
and I looked up into your eyes

32:24.490 --> 32:27.665
and you were so afraid.

32:27.710 --> 32:30.255
But I wasn't.

32:31.795 --> 32:36.760
Because it was finally over.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.520
That's freedom.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.960
Did you fix it?

33:45.485 --> 33:47.880
She's not returning my calls.

33:50.460 --> 33:52.585
You gonna tell me what you did?

33:54.380 --> 33:56.555
It's complicated.

34:00.670 --> 34:03.065
I'll bet it's not.

34:15.150 --> 34:17.360
Are you pretending?

34:19.020 --> 34:21.560
Pretending what?

34:21.605 --> 34:25.920
I believed you when you
said that you loved Nora.

34:27.195 --> 34:29.735
And you said that
you wanted to adopt Lily.

34:29.780 --> 34:33.960
And you said you wanted
us all to be a family.

34:35.170 --> 34:37.429
That's all I want.

34:40.540 --> 34:42.435
Then what are you going to do, Dad?

34:51.719 --> 34:53.895
I don't know.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.905
- Please figure it out.
- I know.

35:05.235 --> 35:07.245
This is twice now, so...

35:43.105 --> 35:44.560
Kevin, I know.

35:44.605 --> 35:46.145
I'm gonna leave first
thing in the morning.

35:46.190 --> 35:47.730
I promise. You didn't need to...

35:47.775 --> 35:49.420
Can we talk?

35:50.445 --> 35:53.125
- What?
- Can I talk to you?

35:56.450 --> 35:58.510
Okay.

36:15.105 --> 36:17.730
What is she wearing?

36:17.775 --> 36:20.430
- What?
- Patti.

36:20.475 --> 36:21.850
When you see her,
what is she wearing?

36:21.895 --> 36:23.065
She's wearing white.

36:23.110 --> 36:26.740
The same thing as when she died?

36:28.400 --> 36:31.160
I don't know. It's just white.

36:32.870 --> 36:34.880
Huh.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.010
Can I get one of those?

36:47.170 --> 36:49.010
Yeah.

36:57.895 --> 36:59.685
Where did you hide them?

36:59.730 --> 37:01.355
What?

37:01.400 --> 37:03.055
Your cigarettes.

37:03.100 --> 37:06.360
When we were married,
where did you hide them?

37:06.405 --> 37:10.700
Oh... in the trunk of my car.

37:12.660 --> 37:14.985
I also stuck a pack under the mailbox

37:15.030 --> 37:17.005
for when I went on runs.

37:19.835 --> 37:21.990
It's fucking great smoking.

37:22.035 --> 37:24.550
Yeah.

37:26.540 --> 37:29.720
So what kinds of things
does she say to you?

37:35.385 --> 37:38.560
Well, she told me not
to tell Nora about her.

37:38.605 --> 37:40.675
'Cause Nora would leave.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.650
Yeah.

37:44.725 --> 37:46.100
And she was right.

37:46.145 --> 37:48.070
Yeah, I guess she was.

37:50.230 --> 37:52.270
And now that Nora's gone,

37:52.315 --> 37:54.710
what kinds of things does Patti say?

37:57.070 --> 37:58.965
Nothing.

37:59.910 --> 38:01.970
Nothing?

38:02.960 --> 38:05.090
No.

38:06.330 --> 38:08.590
Kevin, a few hours ago,
you were yelling at me

38:08.635 --> 38:11.680
to go home and now we're here.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.880
Is she telling you to do something?

38:17.925 --> 38:19.985
Something you don't want to do?

38:24.315 --> 38:26.825
I'm assuming
she's not here right now.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.310
No.

38:31.355 --> 38:34.365
And she wasn't at the gate
when you saw me earlier?

38:34.410 --> 38:35.900
No, she...

38:35.945 --> 38:38.005
Well, that makes sense.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.905
It does?

38:41.950 --> 38:43.575
Uh-huh.

38:43.620 --> 38:46.375
She'd want to stay as far
away from me as possible.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.495
Why?

38:47.540 --> 38:50.600
Because I can prove
she doesn't exist.

38:54.430 --> 38:55.885
How?

38:55.930 --> 39:00.005
I could ask you to make her
tell you something

39:00.050 --> 39:03.510
that only she and I would know and
she wouldn't be able to do it.

39:03.555 --> 39:07.615
But she tells me things all
the time I wasn't there for.

39:09.810 --> 39:11.985
She told me about her husband.

39:12.030 --> 39:13.685
- Neil?
- Neil, yeah.

39:13.730 --> 39:16.355
Kevin, I was Patti's therapist
for over three years.

39:16.400 --> 39:20.275
I mean, don't report me
for breaking confidentiality,

39:20.320 --> 39:23.195
but I told you about Neil.

39:23.240 --> 39:27.450
The serial philanderer
with the anal fixation.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.505
Highly abusive. Probably the reason

39:29.550 --> 39:32.120
she started fixating
on the end of the world.

39:32.165 --> 39:34.290
I...

39:34.335 --> 39:36.565
I don't remember any of that.

39:37.925 --> 39:39.465
Well, maybe if you
listened to me more,

39:39.510 --> 39:41.350
we wouldn't be in this fix, huh?

39:45.015 --> 39:48.355
It's a... it's a joke.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.195
It's a joke.

39:57.575 --> 39:59.485
Well, if you were my patient

39:59.530 --> 40:02.400
walking into my office,
I would indulge this.

40:02.445 --> 40:05.320
You never tell somebody who's in
the midst of a psychotic break

40:05.365 --> 40:07.660
that they are in the midst
of a psychotic break.

40:07.705 --> 40:09.660
But you are not my patient,

40:09.705 --> 40:12.430
so I'm gonna tell you the truth.

40:15.875 --> 40:18.855
What you are seeing is not real.

40:22.050 --> 40:26.225
I know your dad struggled
with this as well.

40:26.270 --> 40:29.815
And there is research indicating
that there is a genetic link...

40:29.860 --> 40:32.685
She's there.

40:32.730 --> 40:34.685
She's right there.

40:34.730 --> 40:36.375
She's real.

40:37.565 --> 40:39.605
- You believe that?
- Yes.

40:39.650 --> 40:42.490
Can I tell you about belief, Kevin?

40:42.535 --> 40:45.610
When the mind is in
emotional distress,

40:45.655 --> 40:48.915
it will grasp at any construct
that makes it feel better.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.335
After the 14th, the whole
world needed to feel better.

40:52.380 --> 40:54.670
We were all in emotional distress.

40:54.715 --> 40:59.345
So that made all of us
susceptible to false belief,

40:59.390 --> 41:02.210
to be taken advantage of.

41:02.255 --> 41:04.965
And the reason I know this, Kevin,

41:05.010 --> 41:08.355
is because Tommy and I use it.

41:09.930 --> 41:11.890
We convince people

41:11.935 --> 41:15.475
that he could take their pain
away just by hugging them.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.645
We had a story.

41:17.690 --> 41:20.530
We made it up, but it worked.

41:20.575 --> 41:25.070
And... I mean, Tommy
hated it, the lying.

41:25.115 --> 41:27.620
And I said it didn't matter as
long as we were helping people.

41:27.665 --> 41:30.155
But he disagreed.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.575
And we had a fight

41:32.620 --> 41:35.465
and he said that he couldn't...

41:36.960 --> 41:38.885
What I am trying to say...

41:42.265 --> 41:45.920
is that they believed it.

41:45.965 --> 41:49.725
Every single person
that he laid his hands on.

41:49.770 --> 41:53.095
Because their brains
would sooner embrace magic

41:53.140 --> 41:55.980
than deal with feelings of fear

41:56.025 --> 41:58.850
and abandonment and guilt.

41:58.895 --> 42:02.155
And all of us turn to someone

42:02.200 --> 42:04.940
who could just turn it off.

42:04.985 --> 42:08.500
Why do you think
I joined a fucking cult?

42:09.990 --> 42:12.700
And now you are manifesting
the leader of that cult

42:12.745 --> 42:16.725
because you need someone
to turn it off.

42:19.215 --> 42:22.845
There is no Patti, Kevin.

42:25.890 --> 42:28.820
There is only you.

42:33.565 --> 42:35.660
So what do I do?

42:38.735 --> 42:41.860
You need to go on medication

42:41.905 --> 42:44.165
and maybe go away for a little while.

42:48.365 --> 42:50.985
What you're dealing with
is very serious, Kevin.

42:51.030 --> 42:55.240
And I know it's scary, but
that's what you need to do.

42:55.285 --> 42:57.545
You need help.

43:04.965 --> 43:07.225
Did you change your last name?

43:08.935 --> 43:10.505
What?

43:10.550 --> 43:13.345
Is your last name still Garvey?

43:13.390 --> 43:15.180
Or did you change it
when we split up?

43:15.225 --> 43:16.345
No, I didn't change it.

43:16.390 --> 43:18.180
Then I can get you a wristband.

43:18.225 --> 43:19.515
Kevin, I don't understand.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.405
Will you come with me?

43:24.615 --> 43:27.075
If you're there,
then she'll leave me alone.

43:27.120 --> 43:29.880
You know, just till I figure it out.

43:31.205 --> 43:32.660
I don't think that's a good idea.

43:32.705 --> 43:35.615
I don't think Jill's
gonna want to see me.

43:35.660 --> 43:38.500
I didn't want to see you.

43:38.545 --> 43:40.505
I'm getting over that.

43:44.670 --> 43:46.930
You said I need help, so...

43:49.725 --> 43:51.600
help.

43:59.485 --> 44:01.245
Jill?

44:05.325 --> 44:07.165
Jill, honey.

44:10.580 --> 44:12.540
She's not home.

44:13.530 --> 44:15.370
Her boyfriend lives next door.

44:15.415 --> 44:17.510
She's probably with him.

44:20.420 --> 44:22.465
Come on in.

44:34.435 --> 44:36.475
Our guest bedroom's in there

44:36.520 --> 44:39.980
if you don't mind sleeping
in a hospital bed.

44:40.025 --> 44:41.815
Mary Jamison's been staying with us.

44:41.860 --> 44:43.765
Mary? Matt's wife?

44:43.810 --> 44:45.320
Yeah.

44:45.365 --> 44:46.575
Long story.

44:52.655 --> 44:54.965
I'm sorry about the dog.

44:57.625 --> 44:59.030
What?

44:59.075 --> 45:02.555
You wanted to get a dog, a puppy.

45:04.835 --> 45:07.310
I was kind of a dick about it.

45:09.505 --> 45:11.395
I forgot that.

45:14.845 --> 45:16.735
I think about that a lot.

45:23.150 --> 45:25.695
Well, consider yourself forgiven.

45:38.615 --> 45:40.490
It's Nora.

45:40.535 --> 45:42.575
Go, take it. I'm fine.

45:42.620 --> 45:44.830
Okay. Hi.

45:44.875 --> 45:48.770
How are you? How's Lily?

45:49.930 --> 45:51.855
Please stop calling me.

45:59.055 --> 46:01.395
Can you tell me where you are?

46:01.440 --> 46:03.345
No.

46:03.390 --> 46:05.235
Why not?

46:06.895 --> 46:09.570
Please, just tell me where you are.

46:09.615 --> 46:11.455
Can we talk about this?

46:12.985 --> 46:14.190
Hello?

46:14.235 --> 46:17.410
I don't want to talk about
you seeing a dead woman.

46:17.455 --> 46:18.860
I know. I know it's...

46:18.905 --> 46:22.615
I know... I know I should
have told you sooner

46:22.660 --> 46:25.450
when it started like we
promised each other,

46:25.495 --> 46:28.455
but I was scared you were gonna run.

46:28.500 --> 46:30.125
And you did.

46:30.170 --> 46:31.625
And you also handcuffed me to a bed

46:31.670 --> 46:33.210
and you didn't even
leave me with a key.

46:33.255 --> 46:37.130
- There was a sign.
- A what?

46:37.175 --> 46:38.965
I left it on the chair by the bed.

46:39.010 --> 46:41.770
It's not there?

46:43.930 --> 46:46.610
She was blocking it.

46:50.190 --> 46:52.310
Oh.

46:52.355 --> 46:54.115
Nora.

46:57.495 --> 46:59.670
I love you.

47:01.450 --> 47:04.240
Listen, there's a way.

47:04.285 --> 47:06.290
I have a way.

47:06.335 --> 47:09.630
A way that I can get better.

47:10.925 --> 47:13.385
But I need to know
that you'd believe me

47:13.430 --> 47:16.855
if I looked you in the eye and
I told you that she was gone.

47:18.300 --> 47:20.395
That you'd know that she was.

47:23.770 --> 47:25.645
How?

47:25.690 --> 47:28.400
It doesn't matter.

47:28.445 --> 47:30.320
I can.

47:32.645 --> 47:36.105
I just need to know that when I do

47:36.150 --> 47:38.795
that you'd believe me.

47:41.740 --> 47:45.335
Because I would never lie to you.

47:47.330 --> 47:49.305
Never.

47:54.835 --> 47:56.930
Would you believe me?

48:00.510 --> 48:03.185
I would believe you.

48:03.230 --> 48:05.355
And would you come back?

48:12.520 --> 48:14.695
I'd like that.

49:06.710 --> 49:08.550
What are you doing here?

49:10.130 --> 49:12.700
Well, honey, your father...
I'm here to...

49:12.745 --> 49:14.870
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

49:14.915 --> 49:16.120
- Dad!
- Jill.

49:16.165 --> 49:18.260
- Jill. Jill.
- Hey, Dad!

49:20.090 --> 49:22.180
What the fuck is she doing here?

49:23.140 --> 49:25.100
Dad!

49:27.760 --> 49:29.770
Dad?

49:35.020 --> 49:37.080
Dad!

49:38.275 --> 49:40.285
Dad!

50:25.455 --> 50:26.745
What's going on?

50:26.790 --> 50:28.075
Oh, nothing, nothing.

50:28.120 --> 50:30.585
Michael was...
Michael was just leaving.

50:43.055 --> 50:45.015
God be with you.

50:53.900 --> 50:55.360
How do we do this?

50:56.350 --> 50:58.525
You just tell me you're ready.

51:00.355 --> 51:02.165
I'm ready.

51:28.685 --> 51:30.860
That should do it.

51:31.885 --> 51:33.345
What is that?

51:33.390 --> 51:35.180
It's poison.

51:35.225 --> 51:37.765
It's gonna stop your heart.

51:37.810 --> 51:39.680
You said temporarily.

51:39.725 --> 51:42.990
That I did. That I did.

51:46.400 --> 51:49.275
This...

51:49.320 --> 51:51.415
epinephrine.

51:53.375 --> 51:57.115
That poison's gonna work
like a heroin overdose.

51:57.160 --> 51:59.670
It's gonna shut you down.

52:00.965 --> 52:04.145
This is gonna start you back up.

52:05.420 --> 52:08.815
Now, I'm gonna time this.

52:10.260 --> 52:12.430
Brain will be fine
for up to five minutes.

52:12.475 --> 52:15.520
I'll give you the shot
long before that.

52:17.850 --> 52:20.555
You've done this before?

52:20.600 --> 52:23.810
You know the guy on the pillar?

52:23.855 --> 52:25.810
Yeah.

52:25.855 --> 52:28.145
His name's Edward.

52:28.190 --> 52:31.455
He's a living,
breathing success story.

52:41.505 --> 52:43.850
Just so you know...

52:45.375 --> 52:47.385
this is...

52:50.015 --> 52:52.140
I don't want to die.

52:54.050 --> 52:56.340
Of course not.

52:56.385 --> 52:58.645
Life is precious.

53:13.070 --> 53:14.695
I just drink it?

53:14.740 --> 53:16.715
Just drink it.

53:23.500 --> 53:25.510
Wait!

53:30.970 --> 53:33.680
She here?

53:36.010 --> 53:37.850
I'm...

53:37.895 --> 53:42.915
I'm glad you're finally
taking action, Kevin,

53:42.960 --> 53:45.735
but let's think about
this for a second.

53:45.780 --> 53:49.360
This is a big step for us.

53:49.405 --> 53:51.865
And we don't really know him.

53:52.825 --> 53:54.615
If I'm understanding right,

53:54.660 --> 53:57.070
his primary qualification
is that he's a pedophile.

53:57.115 --> 53:59.260
Shut the fuck up, Patti.

54:08.175 --> 54:10.935
Do you want me to do this?

54:13.215 --> 54:16.670
- What?
- Do you want me to do this?

54:16.715 --> 54:18.645
Or don't you?

54:24.560 --> 54:27.155
I absolutely want you to do it.

54:28.865 --> 54:32.125
What? What? What did she say?

54:35.205 --> 54:38.945
Laurie just told me
I was a psychotic.

54:38.990 --> 54:43.750
That I belonged in a mental
hospital like my dad.

54:43.795 --> 54:46.370
That was his diagnosis, too.

54:46.415 --> 54:47.870
Psychotic.

54:47.915 --> 54:51.705
I saw him right before I came here

54:51.750 --> 54:54.375
and he told me the voices were gone,

54:54.420 --> 54:56.650
that he was cured.

54:57.975 --> 54:59.215
And I asked him how.

54:59.260 --> 55:01.020
You know what he told me, Patti?

55:03.095 --> 55:06.440
He said he finally just did
what they told him to do.

55:11.070 --> 55:12.415
Kevin, stop!

55:15.110 --> 55:16.950
Good-bye, Patti.

55:27.340 --> 55:30.050
How long does this usually take to...

55:47.775 --> 55:50.600
I'm sorry, son. I know it hurts.

55:50.645 --> 55:52.870
But it won't be long now.
