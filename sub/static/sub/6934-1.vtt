00:39.540 --> 00:43.465
ANNOUNCER: Introducing,
the fighting pride of Newbridge, Wales,

00:43.544 --> 00:49.301
former undisputed Super Middleweight
World Champion and reigning,

00:49.383 --> 00:54.765
defending Light Heavyweight
Champion of the World,

00:55.347 --> 01:00.228
Joe...

01:00.310 --> 01:02.028
Calzaghe!

01:10.404 --> 01:12.748
REFEREE: Okay, gentlemen, we went
over the rules in the dressing room.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.625
Obey my commands at all times
and protect yourself at all times.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.123
Touch 'em up.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.464
JOE CALZAGHE: It was as if my life
was flickering through all my career

01:25.544 --> 01:27.467
looking around and just taking it in.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.514
Just looking round thinking,
”Look where I am. "

01:29.590 --> 01:32.434
There's no way I'm just going to throw
everything away on my last fight.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.183
REFEREE: Box!

01:49.860 --> 01:51.077
Break!

02:10.088 --> 02:15.766
REFEREE: Four, five, six, seven, eight...

03:31.420 --> 03:32.922
ENZO CALZAGHE: Just another wet day.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.179
I remember these steps.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.353
I created them one by one.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.641
They're 36 up there and 36 coming down.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.067
So much...

03:49.104 --> 03:51.903
Pretend it's going to
be hard to get in here.

03:51.940 --> 03:52.987
So people don't rob me.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.739
So, it's really hard.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.281
This is it.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.741
There you are.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.373
Bingo. The lights are back on.
I must have paid the rent.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.153
You can imagine
what it was like in Sardinia.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.155
If you don't work, you don't eat.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.701
We had five kids.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.905
So, my dad worked his bollocks off

04:39.321 --> 04:41.540
Day and night, day and night.

04:44.409 --> 04:48.414
I got brought up to hope about him,
wish about him.

04:48.497 --> 04:52.422
”l wish he'd seen me playing football,
I wish he would turn up. ”

05:04.304 --> 05:06.978
I knew my dream was to be a footballer.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.397
And he told me,

05:09.684 --> 05:12.437
"No, leave football alone and try music. "

05:12.521 --> 05:15.570
Because my uncle wanted me
to be a bass player.

05:20.904 --> 05:24.283
So there you are,
I couldn't argue with that at all.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.874
And then I'll become a musician.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.205
My dream kept going.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.041
I'm gonna leave Sardinia.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.545
I'm going to follow the music.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.002
I gotta leave.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.003
And that's what happened.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.591
I run away, and I put two words
on the wall when I left.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.971
Ritorno, quandosaromillionario

05:45.053 --> 05:47.306
"I'll come back when I'm a millionaire."

05:47.389 --> 05:49.016
And that's on the wall.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.397
They couldn't believe it.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.781
I went hitchhiking all round Europe,

05:56.857 --> 05:58.905
and I ended up in Cardiff Wales.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.074
I met Jackie, and we were
married four weeks later

06:04.990 --> 06:07.118
And it was love at first sight.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.277
JOE: First time I actually hit something,
it was not a punch bag.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.779
I think, uh, it was my dad's hands,

06:40.859 --> 06:44.739
a rolled-up carpet and, uh,
and settee cushions,

06:44.779 --> 06:46.452
watching the Rocky films.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.828
My dad, I think he worked
as a bus conductor.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.005
But mainly he was a musician,
you know, he'd do gigs,

06:53.079 --> 06:56.253
and my mum was a housewife,
obviously myself and two younger sisters.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.085
So, yeah, it was pretty hard.

06:58.877 --> 07:03.007
Dad had like, uh,
pad or something, didn't he?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.800
He bought Joe one of
those stand on pads...

07:05.813 --> 07:06.719
That's right.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.680
...Uh, for Christmas, and
I just remembered

07:09.763 --> 07:11.982
Joe just punching at it
and Dad was like "Ah",

07:12.057 --> 07:14.731
he just noticed something different
about Joe, the way he was doing it.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.313
ENZO: I just picked bits
and pieces off Ali,

07:17.395 --> 07:19.443
the way he'd throw his jabs,
Sugar Ray Leonard,

07:19.522 --> 07:21.115
you know, I copied a bit, you know.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.865
And I let him do things on the bag...

07:23.944 --> 07:26.242
Not with an intention
of turning him into a boxer.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.374
JOE: I always remember
the first day going to the gym,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.455
like a little, tiny,
skinny, little 9-year-old.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.381
Actually, it was quite frightening.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.427
Because I remember walking in
and just the smell of the gym,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.337
the sweat and, um,

07:42.420 --> 07:46.266
the big guys, the noise on the bags,
and the bags were swinging round.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.136
And I had this nervous, nervousness,

07:49.219 --> 07:51.642
and, wow, you know,
I'd never seen anything like it.

07:53.765 --> 07:58.066
It was made of wood and tin, it was always
freezing cold and dusty and dirty.

07:58.144 --> 08:02.149
Basically, the council said it was so
unsafe, it was going to fall down anytime.

08:07.153 --> 08:11.283
ENZO: A guy called Paul Williams
was there, and Paul said to me,

08:11.366 --> 08:13.289
"Has he trained before?"
No!

08:13.368 --> 08:15.166
"Has he been to another gym?"
"No, never has."

08:15.245 --> 08:16.292
Okay!

08:16.371 --> 08:19.090
JOE: "Put your hands up. ” I think he
tried to stand me as a right-hander.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.008
Obviously, me being a
leftie, I'm a southpaw.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.382
So I stood straight up, put my hands up.

08:23.420 --> 08:27.425
You know, he said, like, double jab left
and I'd done exactly what he said-

08:29.175 --> 08:31.803
"You've got an open class boy there."

08:32.178 --> 08:34.931
So, "Open class".
I didn't have a clue what that meant.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.768
I asked everyone. "Hey, mate,
you know, open class, what that mean?"

08:37.851 --> 08:39.273
That means very special.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.318
Joe came back.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.650
He Said, "Dad,liked it! I liked it!"

08:45.859 --> 08:47.907
UCCIO CALZAGHE: We were
taking a walk with my mother.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.330
She kind of, uh, you know, thought
there was something wrong with him

08:50.405 --> 08:52.032
'cause, you know,
with all his gestures all the time,

08:52.115 --> 08:53.833
just punching the air, you know.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.918
Like he was, uh, trying to catch
flies or mosquitoes.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.296
He knocked flies out,
believe it or not, he did!

09:02.375 --> 09:03.968
It's not a joke.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.553
I realised I was never
going to play for Italy

09:06.566 --> 09:08.925
or Juventus or Wales
or any team like that.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.930
Uh, my hands were a lot
quicker than my feet.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.391
ANNOUNCER: ...Calzaghe.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.486
The winner is Calzaghe.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.652
JOE: Paul was my main trainer at the time.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.579
I'd go Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays to the boxing gym.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.740
Then every other day, my father trained me.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.789
And I trained myself

09:36.868 --> 09:39.246
So I trained every day,
not three times a week.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.751
Like a professional.

09:56.805 --> 10:02.232
ENZO: This was his choice to be a boxen
not me making him a boxen

10:02.602 --> 10:05.697
He knew himself how good he was.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.239
He knew.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.865
ANNOUNCER: In the red corner
from Wales, Joe Calzaghe.

10:12.195 --> 10:15.745
JOE: Just being a champion, being a winner;
to become the best.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.000
That's what motivated
me more than anything.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.054
Was I a happy kid?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.632
Um, yes and no, I suppose.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.887
It was hard when I got a bit older.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.560
I suffered a lot of bullying.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.262
Not physical, but verbal.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.432
-And we were bullied as well.
-Because we were his sisters.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.394
I never told Joe 'cause we were frightened
that Joe would do something about it,

10:43.476 --> 10:44.477
and he'll get in trouble.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.938
So, I never ever told Joe.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.943
-It was horrible, Weren't it?
-Yeah, it was terrible.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.110
JOE: I was like the skinny boy
from a different area

10:52.193 --> 10:54.946
who was the British champion,
obviously getting picked on by older kids.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.657
And because I was pretty quiet,
you know, I'd take it to heart.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.787
There wasn't that many foreigners
as well in our days.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.918
And I think a lot of it came
'cause Dad was foreign

11:03.997 --> 11:05.169
and we had a lot of
things like spaghetti...

11:05.248 --> 11:07.046
It was like our name as well, Calzaghe.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.126
-It was like...
-Yeah.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.088
They always called us
"dirty, stinking, Itai..."

11:11.462 --> 11:14.557
"Look at what he is,
look at olive oil guy", you know.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.304
Joe probably was isolated.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.389
He had no brother with him.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.937
Because if he had a brother with him,
they wouldn't bully him.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.851
MELISSA: Joe unwittingly, as well,
he had a lot of girl attention,

11:23.933 --> 11:25.901
which Joe never wanted
because Joe was so shy.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.479
'Cause he was a good looking boy.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.860
And there was a lot of jealousy,
I think, 'cause of that, as well.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.622
SONIA: One day, they came to the house
and there was about 40 of them on bikes.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.119
MELISSA: Yeah they did, yeah.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.494
SONIA: So, Dad just said,
come in one by one and he'll beat 'em up.

11:42.577 --> 11:43.999
You know, let's have a go.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.550
They didn't. They just drove off
on their bikes, didn't they?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.515
I find it difficult to talk about it, I do.

11:59.594 --> 12:02.143
I find it hard to talk
about it, it upsets me.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.644
JOE: Boxing was my way of escaping
and having self-worth.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.479
You know, feeling good about myself

12:15.026 --> 12:16.778
MELISSA: I think that when
he was taking the physical pain,

12:16.819 --> 12:18.287
it was taking his emotional pain out.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.867
'Cause Joe was such an emotional person,
he's so sensitive, it's unbelievable.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.543
I think that that was his way of getting...

12:23.618 --> 12:26.041
When he'd come from school feeling so hurt,

12:26.120 --> 12:29.215
that he would go and do that,
and it would get the anger out.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.672
JOE: Everything is meant for a reason.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.599
I look back at everything,
and I don't regret nothing, you know.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.929
Maybe toughened me up,
maybe it made fighters that tried

12:42.011 --> 12:43.934
to, to bully me verbally.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.018
Maybe that education in school
made me strong.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.608
COMMENTATOR: Joe Calzaghe,

12:51.437 --> 12:53.189
18 years old,

12:54.232 --> 12:55.734
from Newbridge way.

12:57.944 --> 13:03.326
Joe Calzaghe, he really has got
something going for him out there.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.416
JOE: And then my trainer and Paul Williams,
wanted me to turn pro with him.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.544
He came up, he tried to make me
sign something to manage me.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.001
I was still a kid, and I thought,
"I can't do this".

13:16.421 --> 13:20.722
COMMENTATOR: The experience now, of
Michael Smyth, catching up with Calzaghe.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.679
He's good, but he's got to be careful.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.812
JOE: And I just told him.
And Paul gave the keys to my dad.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.437
And I never saw him again.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.527
My dad took over.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.439
I'll manage it, myself.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.402
But what happened, any boxer disappears,
and it's just one man alone.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.531
It's just me.

13:39.610 --> 13:43.285
I spent everything I had
to carry on with his gym.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.035
UCCIO: At the time, we were
playing in a band, me and Enzo.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.586
Picked up the phone.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.587
He said, "I'm gonna quit."

13:51.331 --> 13:53.254
I said, "What do you mean,
you're gonna quit? You can't quit."

13:53.333 --> 13:56.177
I mean, you know, we're near
to a record deal and stuff like that.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.051
He said, "No, no.
I'm, I'm gonna train my son."

13:59.756 --> 14:01.133
Like, I was a bit shocked, you know.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.388
'Cause he didn't have
that experience, you know?

14:04.302 --> 14:05.929
ENZO: I said "Joe, what shall we do?

14:06.554 --> 14:07.976
"Paul's gone_"

14:08.514 --> 14:10.892
He said "Crack on, Dad!
Just get on with it."

14:10.975 --> 14:13.273
Fuck 'em, you know? Get on with it.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.983
So, he gave me the power
of thinking we could still do it.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.323
COMMENTATOR: Round two
of the ABA Welterweight Final.

14:21.402 --> 14:25.908
Wearing the red singlet, the Welsh champion
Joe Calzaghe, who's only 19,

14:26.199 --> 14:29.703
trained by his father;
Enzo, Italian ancestry.

14:32.497 --> 14:35.421
ENZO: Let's see if I can be a part of him.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.920
Let's see if I can be a trainer.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.673
Let's see if I can be a pusher.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.722
ANNOUNCER: Calzaghe. In the blue corner.

14:46.260 --> 14:49.059
Joe needed a push.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.185
And I can push.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.644
COMMENTATOR: Calzaghe,
probably the only boxer in the world

14:53.726 --> 14:55.979
with a singer-songwriter as a trainer.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.355
REFEREE: Stop! Stop!

14:57.939 --> 14:59.441
And it's been stopped.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.446
And Joe Calzaghe has won
another ABA Championship.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.072
ENZO: Everybody knew he was talented.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.490
He's a one and only.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.075
I, I don't believe it's been done before.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.910
No one's ever done it
at three different weights.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.203
I'll be the first.

15:13.788 --> 15:17.088
COMMENTATOR: He is one of those boxers
who, uh, has no doubt at all in his mind

15:17.166 --> 15:20.215
when he goes into the ring, that he's
going to be the dominant character.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.467
Soaking up punch after punch.

15:25.591 --> 15:30.848
So it's all over, and it looks pretty clear
that Joe Calzaghe has done it again.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.774
To win three titles in a row
at different weights.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.270
GARETH A. DAVIES: Joe had his own style.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.276
He was a southpaw, obviously.

15:39.355 --> 15:42.199
So... And very adept and very athletic.

15:43.776 --> 15:49.829
But he had a father who was not classically
trained as an amateur boxer,

15:50.741 --> 15:53.711
but he'd been in the musical world
playing in a band.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.584
He's got that energy about him.

15:55.621 --> 16:00.798
But what it did was,
he transferred a lot of musical movement

16:01.544 --> 16:06.846
into Joe throwing five, six
and seven-punch combinations.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.108
Doesn't every song start off with a verse?

16:16.934 --> 16:19.153
# Change your heart... #

16:19.228 --> 16:20.354
ENZO: Which is...

16:20.980 --> 16:23.654
Jab, jab...

16:26.736 --> 16:29.285
After the verse, it got a bit late.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.741
Bring it forward, bring it forvvard_

16:31.824 --> 16:34.418
Then you've got the chorus.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.247
One, two, three, four, five, Wham, wham,
wham, bam, bam, knockout punch.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.387
ANNOUNCER: Round one.

16:50.218 --> 16:53.188
JOE: I remember
I turned professional in 1993.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.689
I think I was 21.

16:55.932 --> 16:59.778
First pro fight was, um, in the stadium,
Cardiff Arms Park.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.980
I remember boxing a guy called Paul Hanlon.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.397
COMMENTATOR: Joe Calzaghe.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.861
How good is he going to be here
in this Super Middleweight Division?

17:07.902 --> 17:09.654
JOE: Yeah, I boxed on the, on the undercard

17:09.737 --> 17:12.707
of Frank Bruno and uh, Lennox Lewis.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.411
And I won in the first round.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.298
Obviously, I stayed on after to watch the
fight with Lennox Lewis and Frank Bruno,

17:24.377 --> 17:26.471
and, you know,
to be there when the crowd was full

17:26.546 --> 17:28.799
and the sense of atmosphere was amazing.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.680
And it was giving me tingles,
and I used to think to myself,

17:31.759 --> 17:35.605
"This is what I want.
One day, this is going to be me."

17:40.101 --> 17:43.446
Get up in the morning, rain, sleet,
or snow, and just go for a run.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.818
Go to the gym.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.820
Go home, come back and train again.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.701
That's it. Every day.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.198
Every single day.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.697
Iran, I ran, I ran.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.499
I jab, I work.
I worked with him before he did it.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.668
And that's what Joe loved.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.462
JOE: I used to train 12
weeks before the fight.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.715
The first few weeks would be hard,
and then you get into the groove.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.507
Start sparring.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.638
Go!

18:12.717 --> 18:15.220
JOE: We had different combinations
like A's, B's and C's.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.643
And we'd like throw
300 punches a round, possibly.

18:18.723 --> 18:19.895
One, two, three, four, five.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.396
ENZO: What if I've got
a machine gun in my hands?

18:21.642 --> 18:24.016
Seven shots, you're gonna
hit him with four,

18:24.029 --> 18:26.148
five you'll hit him with.
Common sense.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.073
Why not make boxing the same way?

18:28.149 --> 18:29.696
Rock 'n' roll.
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.618
Numbers, numbers.
You gonna hit.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.949
COMMENTATOR: A lot of boxing writers

18:33.029 --> 18:34.747
wouldn't have picked him
as their tip for the top.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.952
And look at the clusters here.

18:36.032 --> 18:39.252
Rosamond is taking a thorough pounding
and the referee has got to step in.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.920
And he has.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.714
Four straight wins for Joe Calzaghe.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.501
COMMENTATOR: His wife Mandy is there.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.091
He's something of a family man,
Joe Calzaghe,

18:49.170 --> 18:51.844
who never leaves home during his training.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.845
That's the way he likes it,
and you have to respect that.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.391
JOE: I was knocking everybody out.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.974
The first 21 fights, I knocked 20 out.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.604
Sixteen in the first two, three rounds.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.482
I was named as Young Fighter of the Year.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.815
COMMENTATOR 2: Tremendous left hook.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.652
COMMENTATOR 1: What a shot,
what a beautiful uppercut

19:14.362 --> 19:15.488
ENZO: I was mad boover.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.744
I was pretty good,
don't worry about that. Pretty good.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.246
So therefore, if I caught him once,

19:20.326 --> 19:23.796
I used to go "Ah, ah, ah,
here we go, he's coming."

19:23.871 --> 19:26.215
Bang, and I would be like,
"Look at my nose.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.713
"Who busted that? I didn't bust it.
Joe busted it_"

19:28.793 --> 19:30.591
JOE: Most of the time, I would
have an argument with my dad.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.890
Because he was pretty fiery and he'd get
on my nerves and I'd get on his nerves.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.058
That's Italians anyway.
We argue all the time.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.477
But because Joe was his son,
Dad didn't give a shit.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.647
So it didn't matter what he said, Joe,
so, Dad could just let it go.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.190
So he just, "Phew!"

19:43.265 --> 19:44.312
It was just...

19:44.767 --> 19:46.815
An explosion.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.735
JOE: I never saw a contract.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.408
Still on my £300-a-week.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.323
That was it.
I mean, it was difficult from the start.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.995
COMMENTATOR: A lot of people
have criticised Calzaghe

20:00.074 --> 20:02.702
for not having really
fought anyone of note.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.628
Well, we can't be far from the finish now.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.132
Surely, the referee,
Coyle, looking very close.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.675
Well, it's all over now.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.387
Joe Calzaghe's father;
Enzo, lifts him high.

20:14.004 --> 20:17.349
The new British Super
Middleweight Champion, Joe Calzaghe.

20:17.425 --> 20:21.601
There he is, and who knows
where that championship could take him?

20:21.679 --> 20:23.272
More of him to come.
Stay with us.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.099
ANNOUNCER2 Joe Calzaghe.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.064
COMMENTATOR: Referee
Denzil Lewis is looking on here.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.945
-There's nothing coming back...
-ANNOUNCER: One, two...

20:32.982 --> 20:35.072
...and Torres takes
refuge from the canvas.

20:35.085 --> 20:35.906
...three, four.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.658
COMMENTATOR: It's horribly one-sided.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.248
Calzaghe has won.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.872
INTERVIEWER: Are you getting
a bit fed up because they,

20:47.955 --> 20:49.878
they keep putting you
in these high-profile fights.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.551
And then everybody moans about
the quality of the opponents and says,

20:52.626 --> 20:54.378
"Oh, what's Joe Calzaghe proved now?"

20:54.420 --> 20:55.888
I mean, what's your reaction to all that?

20:55.963 --> 20:58.637
It's nothing to do with a classy opponent,
people are saying that.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.343
But people don't realise
just how good I am.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.723
And until I fight for a world title,

21:01.802 --> 21:03.804
then they're going to see
what Joe Calzaghe's all about.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.357
'Cause I'm going to destroy anybody
who's gonna get in the ring with me.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.309
I'm only on 70% so far.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.565
When I get that world title fight,
that's different,

21:10.644 --> 21:12.521
then you're going to see the power.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.399
Well, let's, um,
let's bring in Frank Warren here

21:14.523 --> 21:17.823
who was saying off microphone that there
was nothing wrong with that opponent.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.282
Um, explain?

21:19.904 --> 21:21.702
Well, you're saying that,
you're saying that the opponent

21:21.781 --> 21:23.533
that Joe had in front of him tonight
was no good?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.576
I don't think that he was
a particularly great fighter.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.878
I'm not criticising Joe's performance,
he's done the job.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.672
I mean, what do you want to see, to see
him have a 12-round war or something,

21:30.748 --> 21:31.874
and then you'll be satisfied?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.800
It won't happen
because they can't take the power,

21:33.876 --> 21:35.173
they can't take the hand speed.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.880
He's done well at this level,
he will be stepped up another level.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.761
He will fight for a world title.
It will happen this year.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.014
I don't agree with what you're saying.
You're doing him a disservice...

21:43.093 --> 21:47.849
He made them look bad
because his style of boxing was unique.

21:48.057 --> 21:52.278
So, they always had something against
what Joe was achieving.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.565
And I gotta say this now,
it pissed me off big time.

22:03.197 --> 22:07.998
JOHN FAIRCLOUGH: Joe's relationship
with his father is a very complex one.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.329
Because this man,

22:09.411 --> 22:14.292
when he was going out to a fight,
he's going to let his son be injured.

22:15.501 --> 22:19.426
The son was going to trust his father,
who's sitting at his corner.

22:19.547 --> 22:24.599
And I think it is an immense accolade
to both Enzo and Joe

22:24.677 --> 22:26.943
that they managed to
keep that relationship,

22:26.956 --> 22:28.727
a very, very unusual
relationship,

22:28.806 --> 22:30.433
but it seemed to work.

22:32.101 --> 22:35.230
JOE: He's gonna be worried,
he's gonna have fear.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.360
He's thinks we're gonna win,
but it's stressful for him, as well.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.907
It's not like he's just
training any other fighter.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.193
He's training his son

22:40.568 --> 22:41.740
that's about to get
in the ring where somebody

22:41.819 --> 22:43.821
who is going to try
and knock your head off

22:45.656 --> 22:49.081
ENZO: My son is going into a sport
that can be very dangerous, right?

22:49.159 --> 22:52.288
And Joe knew that
and accepted the consequences.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.046
JOE: My mum, she's, uh,
totally the opposite of my dad.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.968
Uh, she never wanted me to box.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.842
She's like "Joe, you
know, do something else.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.137
"What are you boxing for,
getting punched in the head?"

23:04.216 --> 23:07.561
I've never been to any of Joe's fights, no.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.979
I couldn't bear it, no.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.931
It's horrible. It's a horrible feeling.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.735
And I, and I did see
Johnny Owens going down.

23:21.442 --> 23:24.696
COMMENTATOR: And Owens down
for the second time in his boxing career.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.865
The only times he's ever been down,
and he's in trouble now...

23:35.414 --> 23:39.044
And I can remember he went down
and he didn't get back up.

23:49.637 --> 23:53.687
A father has to teach his son how to live.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.066
A trainer has to teach
his son how to fight.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.647
Those are not always compatible.

24:00.147 --> 24:05.529
Years before, if you wanted to ruin a
fighter, you had him trained by his father.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.955
I mean, there were almost virtually
no success stories.

24:11.325 --> 24:13.874
ENZO: I'm not a masochist, I'm a father.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.172
But in that ring, it's war.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.044
He chose to go to war.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.542
I chose to be with him in the war.

24:21.043 --> 24:24.297
Now, course I got sentiments,
but I got no sentiment whatsoever

24:24.380 --> 24:26.508
for that 36 minutes of fight.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.637
I got no sentiments.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.684
I can't have sentiments.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.142
I can't! I wish I had!

24:32.513 --> 24:34.140
But I haven't got 'em.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.727
Because simply as that,
that's my kid that I'm putting to war.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.687
I put him to war. Right?

24:39.770 --> 24:41.818
He's gotta get out of that war.

24:55.536 --> 25:00.417
COMMENTATOR: Oh, and that
went through straight as a lance,

25:00.499 --> 25:02.922
and he is not going to like that.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.506
That really was bang on the money.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.188
At the press conference,
he looked at me and laughed.

25:18.267 --> 25:22.647
He went "Hey, kid, I'm gonna take you
somewhere you've never been before,

25:23.063 --> 25:24.610
"I'm going to take you into the trenches."

25:24.690 --> 25:26.408
I'm thinking, "Yeah, right, okay."

25:40.414 --> 25:41.540
ANNOUNCER: And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

25:41.582 --> 25:42.879
for 12 rounds of boxing,

25:43.417 --> 25:49.220
for the vacant WBO Super Middleweight
Championship of the World.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.399
CHRIS EUBANK: I was complete,
I was total. I was pure as a fighter.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.226
I was always in shape.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.653
And I'd been training
from the day I'd started.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.025
I never had breaks.

26:07.816 --> 26:12.913
When I was going to fight Joe Calzaghe,
I knew that he was unbeaten.

26:13.781 --> 26:14.998
I knew he was a southpaw.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.576
I had watched him fight.

26:16.658 --> 26:21.710
I thought that perhaps,
he has never fought anyone like me.

26:22.081 --> 26:26.427
Chris Eubank_

26:26.460 --> 26:27.552
EUBANK: I am pure.

26:27.628 --> 26:31.007
I'm a very difficult man to beat
because it's not about money,

26:31.090 --> 26:32.342
it's about honour.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.767
All right, gentlemen.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.099
We went over the rules
in the dressing room.

26:36.178 --> 26:40.149
I expect a good clean fight.
Give me good Sportsmanlike conduct.

26:40.224 --> 26:43.694
Obey my commands at all times.
Shake hands. Good luck.

26:44.061 --> 26:47.486
EUBANK: I didn't know whether
his punching ability was real.

26:47.648 --> 26:51.869
Fast hands, yes, but you have to have lead.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.447
You have to have heavy hands.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.594
COMMENTATOR: Oh, left hand
puts Eubank on the floor.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.346
What a start from Calzaghe!

27:16.802 --> 27:19.225
EUBANK: I remember landing on my back.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.523
I messed the seat of my pants,

27:21.598 --> 27:24.772
is how hard the shot came out of nowhere.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.733
JOE: I caught him with a left hook.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.612
First 15 seconds, he went flying
across the ring, landed on his arse.

27:30.691 --> 27:33.194
Man, I thought,
"This is going to be easy."

27:33.277 --> 27:34.904
"What are you talking about?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.284
"What's Chris Eubank all about?"

27:36.655 --> 27:37.872
Bingo!

27:37.948 --> 27:41.998
Fucking dropped him down. I said, fucking
this, "Joe, that's brilliant. Excellent.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.750
"That not going to last another round.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.126
"Fucking brilliant, get on with it."

27:50.210 --> 27:53.384
EUBANK: All his so-called slaps,

27:54.464 --> 27:56.011
they were hard punches.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.352
He was a hurtful puncher.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.020
Fast and hard.

28:05.142 --> 28:10.524
And at that point in the first round,
I knew I would have to be resourceful.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.700
Motherfucker

28:14.651 --> 28:19.157
He did. He got up and, uh,
he was a good fighter.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.616
He was a good fighter.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.586
COMMENTATOR 1:
Good body shot from Eubank_

28:24.620 --> 28:25.792
Two or three.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.917
COMMENTATOR 2: Calzaghe there
asking a lot of questions

28:30.000 --> 28:33.129
about his heart, his chin,
his determination...

28:33.712 --> 28:35.134
And his right to be here.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.104
I mean, I threw every punch
I could possibly throw.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.402
Two rounds, three rounds,
I remember thinking...

28:49.436 --> 28:51.154
Come back to the stool
and like, breathe heavily,

28:51.230 --> 28:52.857
and he's still doing this little
strut that he does,

28:52.940 --> 28:55.910
looking around and I'm like,
"Oh, Dad, it's going to be a hard night."

28:59.738 --> 29:02.457
EUBANK: I knew in the 11th round,
12th round, I'd still be there,

29:02.532 --> 29:05.536
and if he isn't the real deal,
I will break him in those rounds.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.918
No one stops me.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.008
It's just, uh, it's just a thing.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.889
COMMENTATOR 1: Eubank again,
always with a fast start.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.434
Can he break Calzaghe's resistance?

29:25.013 --> 29:28.688
JOE: Trust me, after seven or eight rounds,
I had, I felt I had nothing left in me,

29:28.767 --> 29:30.644
and wanted to win and wanted to win

29:30.727 --> 29:32.775
and just, you know,
coming through the pain barrier

29:32.896 --> 29:34.739
and gave me a second wind.

29:34.815 --> 29:38.069
And he was right, you know,
he did put me through the trenches.

29:39.486 --> 29:44.037
That's how we do.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.242
We're real.

29:48.912 --> 29:52.792
COMMENTATOR 1: Oh, big left and a right,
and Eubank, how did he stay up from those?

29:57.337 --> 29:59.055
COMMENTATOR 2: Calzaghe
landed a good left hand there.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.553
It's a good exchange from him.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.848
COMMENTATOR 1;
Eubank let him go with his right hand.

30:03.927 --> 30:07.932
He just cannot put out
Calzaghe's fire though.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.152
EUBANK: I mean, he stood strong.
He had it all.

30:50.140 --> 30:53.110
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
we go to the Scorecards.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.564
Dave Pepper scores the bout 118 to 109.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.450
Paul Thomas scores it 116 to 111.

31:00.525 --> 31:04.325
And Roy Francis scores it 118 to 111.

31:04.404 --> 31:09.581
For the winner who is now WBO
Super Middleweight Champion of the World,

31:10.410 --> 31:15.291
Joe Calzaghe!

31:35.685 --> 31:38.780
INTERVIEWER: Joe Calzaghe,
World Champion, how does that sound?

31:39.439 --> 31:41.862
Sounds brilliant, you know,
after all the hard work I've done.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.363
I just thank God.
Obviously, I thank my dad.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.823
I thank all the fans
who've come to support me tonight.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.994
They gave me a lot of incentive
and there's only better to come.

31:53.578 --> 31:58.334
I was not that familiar with Joe Calzaghe
prior to him winning his first world title.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.421
But when he beat Chris Eubank,
uh, that was very exciting.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.385
And I realised this might,
this guy might be something.

32:04.756 --> 32:09.728
Unfortunately then, he made a string
of defences that were mediocre at best.

32:10.011 --> 32:15.438
Uh, it was difficult to get excited by him
in terms of rating him among the very best.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.984
COMMENTATOR: Calzaghe wants
that finish here, and he might get it, too.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.648
And it's stopped.

32:21.731 --> 32:26.988
It is oven and Calzaghe has retained
his title in emphatic style.

32:29.406 --> 32:30.908
INTERVIEWER: I hear
in the build-up to this fight, too,

32:30.991 --> 32:32.538
you had a bit of a handicap
with the sore hands,

32:32.617 --> 32:34.369
you weren't able to do very much sparring?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.626
Well, in fact, I didn't do
no sparring at all for this fight.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.378
I haven't sparred for maybe two months.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.343
JOE: Coming from
beating Eubank and being there,

32:42.419 --> 32:44.968
to suddenly underperforming and struggling.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.059
COMMENTATOR: Oh, terrific shot,
huge shot of the fight.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.183
Right hand,
and Calzaghe getting hit too often.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.063
He must have lost that round.

32:56.224 --> 33:00.320
Um, very disappointing, it seems very much
like he's, he's losing his power.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.695
He used to have destructive punching power;
maybe that's beginning to evaporate.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.901
COMMENTATOR 2: VVe'll try and find
reasons in a moment.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.703
These little bones in your hands,
they're called the metacarpals.

33:08.778 --> 33:12.157
And these were broken very early because

33:12.240 --> 33:16.586
when you keep on
stressing that bone, it breaks,

33:16.620 --> 33:21.126
and unfortunately, even though it mends,
it's actually a weakness.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.836
JOE: I couldn't span
I was seeing all these specialists.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.264
I was having all this treatment,
I just couldn't punch.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.511
Simple as that.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.351
And to be honest, it was
like a minor miracle,

33:31.426 --> 33:35.772
I managed to be able to win fights
not training properly.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.022
MICHAEL PEARLMAN: Sometimes,
Joe wouldn't lift a glove

33:39.100 --> 33:40.773
to punch another human being,

33:40.936 --> 33:44.861
between ending one professional fight
and starting another world title defence,

33:44.940 --> 33:46.863
because his hands were so bad.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.656
INTERVIEWER: You don't want
to mention the hand trouble,

33:48.735 --> 33:50.112
but we were wondering in the fight,

33:50.195 --> 33:53.916
because you seemed to revert
to your boxing skills quite early on.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.583
Has the hand gone again?

34:00.622 --> 34:02.374
ANNOUNCER: Round one.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.301
COMMENTATOR: I think last year;
he was thinking,

34:05.377 --> 34:10.099
he was gonna become a millionaire overnight
and his path would be paved with gold.

34:10.172 --> 34:12.516
-It doesn't work like that.
-COMMENTATOR 2: It doesn't.

34:12.592 --> 34:15.846
It's, it's a very tough sport and it's
a very tough business and, you know,

34:15.929 --> 34:17.772
Calzaghe's beginning to
learn how tough it is.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.818
COMMENTATOR 1: Frank Warren there,

34:22.893 --> 34:26.273
not happy with Joe Calzaghe's
performance there, really.

34:28.108 --> 34:30.110
COMMENTATOR 2: Good shots
going in from Brewer now.

34:33.862 --> 34:36.241
This is a bad patch for Calzaghe.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.714
JOE: I remember boos in the crowd.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.036
I had a meeting with
Frank Warren, he said,

34:45.050 --> 34:46.877
"Listen, Joe, are you
going to retire or what?”

34:46.960 --> 34:48.428
It was never an option to stop.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.088
I had a family, kids.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.716
I had to fight for money.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.980
COMMENTATOR 1: Calzaghe's down.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.983
That's the first time
he's been down in his career.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.578
COMMENTATOR 2: First time
back in the ring in eight months.

35:16.656 --> 35:21.583
He's had a back injury and there's been
some domestic problems in the background.

36:09.042 --> 36:11.966
There was a battle there
that Joe had to do.

36:12.587 --> 36:16.137
He had to have a battle,
because believe me, he was hurt.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.182
Thinking of doing it, you can cope with it,

36:19.594 --> 36:24.270
but when it had and has been done,
the divorce, then you think.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.529
Truthfully, I didn't
think he'd box any more.

36:41.616 --> 36:44.916
I had to find a format
to make him interested,

36:46.287 --> 36:48.665
that he had to train for this fight.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.375
Now, how do you block that out?

36:50.458 --> 36:51.550
I couldn't block it out.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.720
It happened, it's reality.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.424
He had some Hght_
He had that in his mind.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.601
So, imagine a guy who gotta fight.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.519
Can he concentrate on it?

37:01.594 --> 37:05.724
Twelve rounds for a world title.
His career could be gone straightaway.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.741
COMMENTATOR;
What a right hand from Salem!

37:15.817 --> 37:19.822
Calzaghe is down for only
the second time in his career.

37:20.155 --> 37:21.156
ANNOUNCER: Seven, eight...

37:21.448 --> 37:23.416
God says to everybody...

37:27.537 --> 37:30.541
"It's what's inside of you
that counts most of all."

37:33.376 --> 37:35.424
it's what's inside of you.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.600
It was a hard, hard road.

37:45.722 --> 37:49.101
He was tested, and he got through it.

37:50.435 --> 37:56.693
ANNOUNCER: And still,
the undefeated Joe Calzaghe!

38:05.992 --> 38:07.744
JOE: Think I was 34.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.416
I was eight years World Champion.

38:09.496 --> 38:13.876
Not really given the respect
in the States for doing what I did.

38:15.043 --> 38:18.638
There's no doubt that there is
an American bias when it comes to boxing.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.842
We have dominated this sport
for the better part of a hundred years.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.182
So as a result, he never got the credit
he deserved from American fight fans

38:25.220 --> 38:27.097
for the simple reason that he was British.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.397
Even though he was undefeated,

38:28.515 --> 38:31.143
and even though he had
a very lengthy, uh, title reign.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.076
DAVIES: Jeff Lacy came with a big noise.

38:44.155 --> 38:50.253
A really, really dangerous hooker, a very
powerful guy, incredible self-belief.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.293
ANNOUNCER: Undefeated
in the professional ranks,

38:52.372 --> 38:56.969
with a record of 21 wins,
no losses, one no decision,

38:57.043 --> 39:01.298
with 17 wins coming by way of knockout.

39:05.009 --> 39:08.934
He was hyped as
a smaller version of Mike Tyson.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.984
He had the body and the story
of his pro-debut not happening

39:13.101 --> 39:16.401
because his opponent saw him take his
shirt off at the weigh-in and left town.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.402
Got into a bus and left,
"I'm not fighting that guy!"

39:18.731 --> 39:23.487
ANNOUNCER: Here is
the undefeated IBF and IBO

39:23.570 --> 39:26.414
Super Middleweight Champion of the World.

39:26.489 --> 39:33.122
Introducing, Jeff "Left Hook” Lacy.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.840
Jeff Lacy had been a US Olympian.

39:35.957 --> 39:38.801
Um, and was knocking everybody out
with his big left hook,

39:38.877 --> 39:40.720
so, hence the nickname Left Hook Lacy.

39:41.004 --> 39:42.631
His physical makeup
was different from Joe, you know?

39:42.714 --> 39:45.012
He looked like a condom
stuffed with walnuts, you know?

39:45.091 --> 39:46.684
He was properly built, Jeff Lacy.

39:46.759 --> 39:49.638
From what we had seen,
at least in this country, with Joe,

39:49.721 --> 39:53.351
we saw a fighter who was
often technically inferior,

39:53.433 --> 39:56.733
slapped with his punches,
was not the hardest guy to hit.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.899
So, as a result, it was
an easy pick, and virtually,

39:59.939 --> 40:02.943
I would say, 95% of the US media

40:03.026 --> 40:05.186
picked Jeff Lacy to
win and expected him,

40:05.199 --> 40:07.577
fully expected him to
knock out Joe Calzaghe_

40:12.160 --> 40:15.664
JOE: Ten days to two weeks before the
fight, I remember injuring myself

40:35.099 --> 40:40.321
Under no circumstances did Joe want to
fight Jeff Lacy with a damaged hand.

40:40.396 --> 40:43.570
Joe started to believe
this guy really is that good.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.574
Enzo had studied him extensively
and didn't agree.

40:46.903 --> 40:50.248
And it was his job
to try and cajole Joe into realising

40:50.323 --> 40:52.371
yes, this is a fight you can win injured.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.508
ENZO: Have you seen him?

41:01.542 --> 41:05.797
Lacy does five moves to throw one punch.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.304
Do five punches in one move, you do.

41:12.053 --> 41:15.182
JOE: I wanted to pull out the fight
because I actually doubted myself

41:15.264 --> 41:18.063
scared of failure against
this bad guy from America.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.528
ENZO: Do you know what happens
if you don't fucking fight the fight?

41:24.607 --> 41:28.157
They call you a bastard, coward,
they'll call you every name under the sun.

41:28.236 --> 41:30.910
You can forget your boxing careen
you're oven

41:32.407 --> 41:34.205
JOE: And my dad said
”You have to fight this fight.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.081
”Joe, if you got to fight with one arm,
it doesn't matter;

41:36.744 --> 41:38.587
”I'm proud of you no matter what".

41:55.888 --> 41:57.561
The day before the weigh-ins,

41:57.640 --> 42:00.189
I wake up and there's like,
a couple of feet of snow.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.107
And I can't explain, it's magical.

42:07.275 --> 42:10.745
From that moment of walking in
to the garden, I had no nerves.

42:10.820 --> 42:12.663
I was completely calm.

42:13.031 --> 42:15.284
Everything was lifted off me.

42:18.411 --> 42:21.335
ANNOUNCER: He is making
the 18th defence of his title.

42:21.414 --> 42:27.968
Ladies and gentlemen,
the undefeated Joe Calzaghe!

42:31.674 --> 42:34.143
All right, gentlemen,
the time you have been waiting for is here.

42:34.218 --> 42:37.188
The opportunity of a lifetime,
so remember; take advantage...

42:37.263 --> 42:39.686
JOE: I looked in his eyes, man,
and I just knew I had him.

42:39.766 --> 42:42.019
He looked away, he didn't
want to look at me in the eyes.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.188
He looked stiff he looked nervous.

42:44.270 --> 42:47.023
There was no way this guy was ever going
to come over and beat me.

42:48.191 --> 42:49.989
ANNOUNCER: Round one.

42:50.443 --> 42:52.821
COMMENTATOR: Finally,
the unification fight

42:52.904 --> 42:56.158
Calzaghe has... has arrived.

42:56.657 --> 43:00.787
The Lacy camp think
Calzaghe is over the hill,

43:00.870 --> 43:03.840
and that he's a man ready to be taken.

43:08.711 --> 43:11.806
As Calzaghe gets hit,
he starts going into a tear up.

43:11.881 --> 43:14.555
Remember the left hand is the fragile one.

43:14.634 --> 43:17.854
He can't afford to have that one damaged.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.155
COMMENTATOR 1 : Lovely right uppercut.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.906
COMMENTATOR 2:
Joe Calzaghe at the moment,

43:31.984 --> 43:33.702
but there's a long way to go.

43:33.778 --> 43:36.827
And a little contemptuous
smile from Calzaghe.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.542
He's saying to him.
"Don't worry, man. Don't worry.

43:43.579 --> 43:46.048
"He's gonna cool down now.
Don't worry about that."

43:48.292 --> 43:50.090
COMMENTATOR: Look at
that superb flurry of punches.

43:50.169 --> 43:53.298
I say, there might have been nine or 10.

43:53.589 --> 43:56.388
Round eight, the guy's looking at
us saying, "Where's the cool down?"

43:58.928 --> 44:00.851
COMMENTATOR: Dear me,
that face is just a mess.

44:00.930 --> 44:02.477
Look at the eyes of Jeff Lacy.

44:04.058 --> 44:05.310
He didn't beat him,

44:06.394 --> 44:07.691
schooled him!

44:09.814 --> 44:10.861
COMMENTATOR: Fantastic!

44:10.940 --> 44:12.908
Winding up the right
hand, striking the jab.

44:12.942 --> 44:14.410
Hitting him with the left hook.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.788
If it was a ballet, it
would have been Nureyev.

44:17.864 --> 44:19.491
It, it was just magical.

44:19.574 --> 44:22.703
I can remember not sleeping
for two days after that fight.

44:23.744 --> 44:26.839
A man danced with another man,

44:26.914 --> 44:29.758
like he was blessed,
like something was shining on him.

44:29.834 --> 44:32.804
Landing punches and avoiding punches
like you've never seen before.

44:34.797 --> 44:37.016
Joe's right foot was sort of
nailed to the canvas,

44:37.091 --> 44:39.059
'cause he would pivot on it, on a 90 degree

44:39.552 --> 44:41.725
and just... And he was gone.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.559
And Lacy was punching mid-air.

44:49.020 --> 44:53.742
Finally, he'd painted a masterpiece
that you could see was there.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.159
Twelve rounds of brilliance.

45:07.163 --> 45:09.211
The Lacy fight is where he took off,

45:09.290 --> 45:12.544
and where America went,
"What the fuck? Who's this guy?"

45:15.755 --> 45:17.553
DAVIES: Joe was one hand.

45:17.632 --> 45:21.307
Forced into the fight,
didn't want the fight, truly delivers.

45:21.385 --> 45:25.856
That was one of the greatest performances
I've ever seen live.

45:25.932 --> 45:31.314
It ignited something in the public
and in the media.

45:31.395 --> 45:33.739
Thanks to my dad,
without him I wouldn't be here today.

45:33.814 --> 45:36.033
He's a great trainer, great dad.
I love him to bits.

45:36.108 --> 45:40.909
Um, and thanks to, you know, my little
kids, Joe and Connor. I love you both.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.660
ENZO: He's just come up to me,
whispered in my ear,

45:42.740 --> 45:44.242
"Dad, you're right!"

45:44.325 --> 45:45.872
I was right.

45:45.952 --> 45:48.626
With an "f-ing", of course.
"Dad, you were right."

45:48.704 --> 45:50.832
"I told you Joe. I told you Joe."

45:50.957 --> 45:52.504
And we kissed each other on the lips.

45:59.465 --> 46:02.014
I was having injections in...
Oh, remember, that's right.

46:02.343 --> 46:05.062
Went to Harley Street, had an operation,

46:05.137 --> 46:07.731
and you, you parked the car,
and you forgot where you parked the car.

46:07.807 --> 46:09.901
That's right. I walked all over the place.

46:09.976 --> 46:12.820
That's it, you were saying
"My fucking hand, but my hand..."

46:12.895 --> 46:13.896
No, it was wrapped up.

46:13.980 --> 46:15.357
-You parked the car on the road somewhere.
-Yeah.

46:15.439 --> 46:18.693
You couldn't find it, and I was
fucking running around, for an hour.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.369
-That's right.
-Fucking hour.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.321
Saying, "My hand, my fucking hand."

46:22.446 --> 46:25.120
Right, 'cause I was coming
off an anesthetic,

46:25.199 --> 46:27.247
I didn't know where the fuck I was.

46:27.368 --> 46:30.292
And I just remember, "I think it's on this
street, I think it's on this street."

46:30.371 --> 46:32.749
That's it, looked everywhere,
do you remember?

46:32.832 --> 46:34.880
If I had two good hands I reckon
I would, I really could have...

46:34.959 --> 46:37.132
That's it.

46:37.211 --> 46:40.385
DAVIES: Two completely
different characters.

46:40.464 --> 46:42.341
And maybe that's why they work.

46:42.425 --> 46:44.268
I mean physically, as well.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.225
They are Abbott and Costello.

46:46.304 --> 46:47.647
They are chalk and cheese.

46:47.722 --> 46:50.521
You would not pick them out
in a room as father and son.

46:50.599 --> 46:52.476
And they act differently as well.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.028
That's great.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.485
PiaceMolto, PiaceMolto.

47:05.281 --> 47:09.661
DAVIES: The energy that Enzo speaks with,
and enunciates with,

47:09.702 --> 47:11.670
and flies around a room with,

47:11.746 --> 47:14.750
is the same energy that
Joe then explodes with when he fights.

47:16.125 --> 47:18.048
COMMENTATOR 1: Calzaghe's
throwing punches by the dozen.

47:18.127 --> 47:20.596
COMMENTATOR 2: The referee might stop it.
The ref's having a look.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.264
COMMENTATOR 1: He's stopped it.
He's stopped the fight.

47:22.340 --> 47:25.640
Joe Calzaghe, that one came from nowhere.

47:26.302 --> 47:28.054
DAVIES: Father and a son.

47:28.137 --> 47:31.732
If the son is fighting professionally,
they are a unit.

47:31.807 --> 47:33.809
This makes a formidable team.

47:34.101 --> 47:37.025
You see, your father
will never mislead you.

47:37.104 --> 47:41.530
And your father is always going to tell you
every single thing that is a liability

47:49.658 --> 47:51.035
JOE: I always knew in the corner.

47:51.118 --> 47:53.792
He always knew if I had a bad round,
I could have six good rounds.

47:53.871 --> 47:58.047
And one bad round, and he'd, he'd
be mouthing off and swearing.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.002
"What's going on? What's going on?"

48:00.086 --> 48:01.463
But he knew how to get to me.

48:12.181 --> 48:15.560
DAVIES: There are lots of times when you,
you have seen his father

48:15.643 --> 48:19.568
literally whipping him into action,
whipping him into shape.

48:21.482 --> 48:24.782
On fight nights, I was not his dad.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.112
Forget that.

48:26.195 --> 48:27.447
We were divorced.

48:29.698 --> 48:33.453
COMMENTATOR: He's on the floor
and it's stopped in the very first round.

48:33.536 --> 48:35.959
Joe Calzaghe in sizzling style

48:36.038 --> 48:40.214
retains his WBO Super
Middleweight Championship.

48:43.212 --> 48:45.556
Every time we went in the corners
for a minute, he was confident.

48:45.631 --> 48:46.723
His eyes were with me.

48:46.799 --> 48:49.302
Not looking round, looking round,
where, where?

48:49.385 --> 48:51.888
He's looked to me in the eyes
and he knew that when I said,

48:51.971 --> 48:55.601
"Throw three B's, trust me, do things",
I said. "Do it!"

48:57.685 --> 49:00.438
COMMENTATOR: And he's stopped.

49:00.521 --> 49:02.523
Everything in two rounds.

49:05.484 --> 49:09.660
His father; Enzo Calzaghe,
has been with him from the word go.

49:09.738 --> 49:15.336
He's the man who shaped this magnificent
champion and Calzaghe remains just that.

49:21.750 --> 49:25.721
STEVE FARHOOD: At times, you need
a trainer who's a psychiatrist.

49:25.838 --> 49:27.431
At times, you need a mother.

49:27.506 --> 49:29.850
At times, you need a cheerleader.
At times, you need a conditioner.

49:29.925 --> 49:31.518
At times, you need a boxing strategist.

49:31.594 --> 49:34.188
And the fact that Enzo,
with really no boxing experience,

49:34.263 --> 49:37.107
was able to create a fighter,

49:37.141 --> 49:41.021
help create a fighter as good as Joe,
is absolutely mind-boggling

49:41.145 --> 49:42.522
Forget the fact that he's his father,

49:42.646 --> 49:45.820
just that he was able to do that
as a trainer was remarkable.

49:50.446 --> 49:54.496
DAVIES: After beating Jeff Lacy,
after beating Sakio Bika,

49:54.617 --> 49:58.747
Joe needed a fight of magnitude

49:58.829 --> 50:03.630
which'd justify him as
the rightful owner of the Ring belt,

50:03.709 --> 50:07.805
the rightful owner
of the Linear Championship.

50:10.299 --> 50:14.020
JOE: Mikkel Kessler by far
was the biggest, biggest name in my weight.

50:17.932 --> 50:23.439
I was the Ring Magazine Champion,
WBO Champion, IBF Champion.

50:25.606 --> 50:28.359
Mikkel Kessler was obviously
WBC, WBA Champion.

50:28.734 --> 50:31.954
And he was undefeated in like,
39 fights, so everything on the line.

50:40.162 --> 50:43.211
PEARLMAN: For both of them,
the main motivating factor was,

50:43.332 --> 50:47.337
we want to be recognised as the best
Super Middleweight fighter in the world.

50:48.921 --> 50:51.228
MIKKEL KESSLER: I know
I can beat him, don't

50:51.241 --> 50:53.301
hit that hard and, I
can beat this guy.

50:54.134 --> 50:56.228
JOE Calzaghe JR: Him and my dad
had got really close,

50:56.303 --> 50:59.056
and they were like, you know,
shouting at each other.

50:59.139 --> 51:01.233
My granddad was shouting
at his manager, you know?

51:01.308 --> 51:02.605
All that Kind of stuff happening.

51:02.768 --> 51:06.944
Block him out, Joe.
Come on, Joe, come on, Joe.

51:07.815 --> 51:09.442
JOE JR: And that's when
you know how real it really is.

51:09.525 --> 51:12.950
'Cause when the fight gets first announced,
it's weird, it's like two months away.

51:13.028 --> 51:15.451
You don't really think about it,
going to school every day.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.952
Then suddenly, the day before,
going to bed, you can't sleep

51:19.034 --> 51:21.128
because you know
tomorrow is going to be that fight night

51:21.203 --> 51:23.752
when your dad is, you know,
is gonna be in that ring

51:23.872 --> 51:25.749
fighting somebody like Mikkei Kessler.

51:26.458 --> 51:28.881
ANNOUNCER: it was here
in the old Cardiff Arms Park

51:28.961 --> 51:32.886
that Joe Calzaghe's career
began back in 1993.

51:32.965 --> 51:37.892
Now he has what may be
one of the toughest nights of his career.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.891
A very, very late night fight

51:42.057 --> 51:45.652
to catch the premium market
in the United States as well.

51:46.145 --> 51:50.446
Fifty-five thousand people
at the Millennium Stadium.

51:50.524 --> 51:53.403
One of the biggest stadium fights
we've ever seen.

51:56.238 --> 51:57.740
JAMES BRADFIELD:
Knowing that you're in Cardiff

51:57.781 --> 51:59.579
and everybody has turned out to see you,

51:59.658 --> 52:01.035
and it's a defining fight for you.

52:01.368 --> 52:04.542
And not only might you lose the fight,
you'll lose your undefeated record.

52:04.622 --> 52:09.503
To actually take that pressure on board,
it just takes unbelievable strength.

52:22.931 --> 52:24.524
COMMENTATOR: Trying
to wing the shot around,

52:24.642 --> 52:28.112
that straight left hand lead of Kesslen
who's started well.

52:29.688 --> 52:32.862
That's a decent right hand from Kessler
and a good left jab.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.119
And now, Kessler's starting to come in.

52:35.194 --> 52:37.071
And he's looking for Calzaghe.

52:37.154 --> 52:39.623
Good right hand.
Good work from Kessler.

52:40.074 --> 52:42.327
DAVIES: Mikkel Kessler was fantastic.

52:42.660 --> 52:47.131
Strong, lovely movement,
crisp timing, heavy shots.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.792
Mikkel Kessler was schooling him.

52:50.626 --> 52:52.503
COMMENTATOR:
Great uppercut from Kessler.

52:52.628 --> 52:54.175
Calzaghe takes it though.

52:54.254 --> 52:55.881
Terrific shot from the Dane.

52:56.256 --> 52:58.600
And these are
dangerous moments for Calzaghe.

52:59.718 --> 53:01.561
DAVIES: The crowd had been silenced.

53:02.012 --> 53:04.231
The dragon wasn't breathing any fire.

53:17.277 --> 53:19.154
Bam, bam, bam, bam.
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

53:31.500 --> 53:34.219
COMMENTATOR 1: Calzaghe trying to work
to the body and making Kessler miss.

53:34.294 --> 53:36.467
This is a better round for Calzaghe.

53:39.633 --> 53:42.978
Oh, this is better.
Right hand from Calzaghe.

53:43.053 --> 53:45.306
Rocks back the head of Kessler.

53:45.681 --> 53:47.228
COMMENTATOR 2: What I was saying
about Calzaghe, John,

53:47.349 --> 53:49.602
he can adapt and he can change his style.

53:49.685 --> 53:52.154
DAVIES: That's what
the great sports people do.

53:52.271 --> 53:54.865
Muhammad Ali could change
the pattern of a fight,

53:54.940 --> 53:57.819
Lionel Messi can change
the pattern of a match.

53:57.860 --> 53:59.783
And that's what we saw in this fight.

54:00.904 --> 54:03.373
COMMENTATOR: Good round though,
this for Joe Calzaghe.

54:03.490 --> 54:05.663
Good uppercut.
Left hand from Calzaghe.

54:06.118 --> 54:07.791
This is a big round for the Welshman,

54:07.870 --> 54:10.214
he's bossed this last minute.

54:10.539 --> 54:11.540
ENZO: Beautiful work.

54:16.378 --> 54:19.006
DAVIES: We saw the athletic
genius of Joe Calzaghe.

54:19.131 --> 54:20.804
His movement became different.

54:20.883 --> 54:22.260
He tied Kessler up.

54:22.301 --> 54:25.100
He, he began to sneak round.

54:26.930 --> 54:29.024
KESSLER: I had timing, I had the shape.

54:29.099 --> 54:32.694
I was there, but he could
adapt his boxing style.

54:32.770 --> 54:36.570
And that was something
I was too young to, to understand then.

54:37.649 --> 54:41.028
COMMENTATOR: Calzaghe showing
superb boxing skills there.

54:41.904 --> 54:43.998
DAVIES: That desire in him, the heart.

54:44.072 --> 54:48.623
You have to give him 100 out of
100 for heart, Joe Calzaghe_

54:52.873 --> 54:56.503
COMMENTATOR: The two hug.
May even be a word from Calzaghe.

54:57.085 --> 54:59.179
I think Kessler knows
that he's lost that one.

54:59.588 --> 55:03.058
Calzaghe raises his arms and celebrates

55:03.133 --> 55:05.261
At the age of 35...

55:05.302 --> 55:08.977
...maybe his biggest
test has been this one.

55:12.518 --> 55:15.613
KESSLER: After the fight I said to him,
let's have this rematch.

55:16.271 --> 55:18.148
He said, "No, mate.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.405
"Tonight was my night."

55:42.923 --> 55:44.596
KESSLER: I think you were
a little nervous right there.

55:44.716 --> 55:45.717
I could see that in your eyes.

55:45.926 --> 55:47.143
-Oh, yeah, little bit.
-Is that true?

55:47.219 --> 55:48.660
Oh, yeah, well
obviously, when you're

55:48.673 --> 55:50.393
fighting in front of
50,000 people, come on.

55:50.472 --> 55:51.473
I was fighting you.

55:51.557 --> 55:52.774
You had knocked
everybody out, nearly, you know?

55:52.850 --> 55:55.319
'Course I'm gonna be a bit nervous,
you know what it's like.

55:55.811 --> 55:58.405
I thought to myself, "If I lose man,
I don't want to think about losing,

55:58.480 --> 56:00.778
"but I can never show my face
in Cardiff again."

56:00.858 --> 56:03.577
They'd carry me out, mate, carry me out.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.821
My trainer, Jim Montoya, you Know Jim.

56:05.904 --> 56:08.157
Yeah, yeah, he did my bandages.

56:08.240 --> 56:10.493
Yeah, he's, um, he said,

56:10.576 --> 56:14.831
"When you hit Calzaghe with a right, you
should have come back with a left hook."

56:14.913 --> 56:16.915
I only threw the right hand, you Know.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.713
Yeah, thanks.

56:21.879 --> 56:23.426
Hey, your father is happy.

56:23.672 --> 56:25.015
That bastard.

56:31.972 --> 56:33.519
Hey, come on, man.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.610
As I said, I hate watching
my fights when I lose,

56:36.685 --> 56:38.232
but this is good, this is good.

56:38.353 --> 56:40.026
-Oh, thank you, man.
-This is okay, man.

56:40.105 --> 56:41.903
I lost that fight.
But I tried everything.

56:43.525 --> 56:44.868
Good fight, my man.

56:44.943 --> 56:47.037
Good fight, Joe.

56:48.822 --> 56:53.202
PEARLMAN: I think, even if there had been
those of us who hoped Joe might say,

56:53.285 --> 56:55.663
"I'm the undisputed
Super Middleweight Champion.

56:55.746 --> 56:58.169
"There's nowhere else for me to go.
I'll hang them up."

56:58.248 --> 57:01.843
It just, it became obvious
from what we were hearing from America

57:01.960 --> 57:03.928
that, that wasn't going to be
an option for him, you know.

57:04.004 --> 57:06.928
All of a sudden,
all the calls had come in to Frank Warren

57:07.007 --> 57:10.011
and they're coming to Joe Calzaghe,
"When can you get over here?"

57:10.093 --> 57:12.687
And I think that was...
That was irresistible for him.

57:35.786 --> 57:38.790
JOE: You need to go to the States
to be recognised by the American press,

57:39.164 --> 57:40.916
by the American writers.

57:40.999 --> 57:42.171
You have to go there.

57:47.839 --> 57:50.388
So what I did, the week
after the Kessler fight,

57:50.509 --> 57:53.012
bought my own ticket, went out to America,

57:53.095 --> 57:56.941
and, um, the whole point of me
going over was to bump in to Hopkins.

57:57.432 --> 58:00.185
Bernard Hopkins was, pound-for-pound,
one of the best in the world.

58:00.268 --> 58:01.690
I knew I wanted to fight that guy.

58:05.399 --> 58:07.527
Hopkins was in the press room,
and I could see him come in.

58:07.609 --> 58:10.408
'Cause I was doing interviews and Hopkins
was on the other side of the room.

58:12.406 --> 58:14.750
I remember him making his way towards me.

58:15.117 --> 58:17.745
Twenty five years a boxer with
this face, man. It's for a reason.

58:17.828 --> 58:20.456
You fought in every...
Because you fought over in Europe...

58:20.539 --> 58:22.758
-Because you fought in Europe.
-You think you could beat Kessler?

58:22.874 --> 58:25.252
You fought in Europe.
Kessler ain't not in my league, man.

58:25.377 --> 58:26.845
It was like the school playground.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.672
Fight... There's a fight
going on over there.

58:28.839 --> 58:31.433
And, of course,
that's where Bernard famously said...

58:31.508 --> 58:33.260
I would never let a white boy beat me.

58:33.301 --> 58:34.393
If we fight you will lose.

58:34.469 --> 58:35.937
I you fight me, you will lose.

58:36.013 --> 58:37.765
-I'll never let a white boy beat me.
-You will lose.

58:38.056 --> 58:41.151
"l ain't never been beaten by a white man.
I ain't never been beaten by a white man."

58:41.226 --> 58:42.273
And we were just like...

58:42.978 --> 58:44.070
And you can call in any statement you want.

58:44.146 --> 58:46.490
Anybody can put it down,
I will never lose to a white person.

58:46.565 --> 58:47.862
I can't wait, man.

58:47.899 --> 58:50.197
I thought, "Yes!" I loved it.

58:50.277 --> 58:52.279
I thought, "Yes", this fight's
gonna get made right now.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.364
And all the cameras
before he realises are on.

58:54.948 --> 58:56.871
Rung up Frank Warren, I said,
"Listen, the fight's been made. ”

59:02.914 --> 59:04.632
BRADFIELD: Always scares me
when a fighter goes up a weight

59:04.708 --> 59:07.006
because you never know how their body
is gonna react to it you know.

59:07.085 --> 59:09.053
Will he keep his work rate up, you Know.

59:09.129 --> 59:13.100
You're thinking the punches are perhaps
gonna have a bit more heft to them,

59:13.175 --> 59:14.893
but kind of like, will he be
able to keep his work rate up?

59:14.968 --> 59:16.845
And Joe's work rate was always great.

59:16.928 --> 59:19.226
So, I was... Again, I was
scared for that fight.

59:22.350 --> 59:23.351
DAVIES: He said,
when they came face-to-face,

59:23.435 --> 59:24.652
”You're a small guy.

59:24.936 --> 59:27.189
"You are this Super Middleweight
they been talking about?"

59:28.023 --> 59:29.900
MATTHEW RHYS: You know, here's a man
known as the Executioner,

59:29.983 --> 59:31.576
who spent time in a penitentiary, and...

59:32.235 --> 59:33.828
At the age of what he was,

59:34.029 --> 59:36.908
was a very intimidating and terrifying man.

59:37.199 --> 59:40.453
Every red-blooded American's
gonna be happy with the outcome.

59:41.286 --> 59:43.505
I'm gonna kick his British ass
come April 19th.

59:45.707 --> 59:49.678
The nine year old Joe Calzaghe, the kid
that had been bullied by the bullies

59:49.795 --> 59:52.173
was fighting probably
the biggest bully in boxing.

59:52.631 --> 59:57.603
He was somebody who you thought, this is
gonna maybe be a step too fan for Joe.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:06.528
JOE: I remember the weigh-ins,
and having thousands of people

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.105
queue up for a weigh-in.

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:11.738
And all the Welsh flags, Welsh banners,

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:15.321
and Hopkins came out
and they were booing him.

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:16.780
And he must have looked
in the crowd thinking,

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.958
"I'm fighting in my country
and there's like all Brits and that."

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:23.458
It was brilliant and, you know, it's like,
you know, the British fans are the best.

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:25.005
Welsh fans, British fans are amazing.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.465
They don't do it anywhere
else in the world,

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.885
and British fans will travel
and come watch you fight.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.805
RHYS: I remember when getting
off the plane in Nevada, thinking,

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.303
”Who turned off the lights in Wales
when they left?"

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.852
Because everyone was in Las Vegas.

01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:41.180
You couldn't move for dragons and...
And that's all you could hear,

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:42.810
was that slow...

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:47.190
# Super; super Joe!
Super super Joe #

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:51.027
MAN: # Super; super Joe!
Super; super Joe!

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.941
# Super; super Joe!

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.826
# Super Joe Calzaghe! #

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.112
-Ah! I know that one.
-BOTH: Yeah.

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:57.195
We peaked at the anthem.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.452
It felt like Cardiff out there.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.579
The amount of supporters
who went out there,

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:05.754
and everyone saw, it was like
that mini community going around.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.923
-"Oh, you're from Wales? Da-da-da-da-da."
-Yeah.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.500
And it's_.. It was a great buzz.

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:12.548
# Super; super Joe!
Super Joe Calzaghe! #

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.886
DAVIES: Seven thousand people
travelled oven which was extraordinary.

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:19.809
The fans, everywhere,
just having a great time.

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:21.094
MICHAEL J. FOX:
Just so many Welshmen there.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:24.352
Catherine Zeta-Jones,
and Tom Jones and...

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.900
Howard Stringer,
the head of Sony, and all these...

01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:28.192
All these crazy Welshman.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:29.565
CONNOR Calzaghe: Al Pacino as well.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.030
I literally just remember
shaking his hand as well...

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.863
And I was like,
"This made it absolutely, even better."

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.528
Even though you can
feel the atmosphere, you know,

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:39.113
but you don't really see anything.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:53.426
ANNOUNCER: The moment
the world has been waiting for.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.680
Twelve rounds of boxing

01:01:56.755 --> 01:02:03.263
for the Linear Light Heavyweight
Championship of the World.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:12.105
Joe...

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:15.031
Calzaghe!

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:23.123
Bernard, the Executioner...

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:25.701
Hopkins!

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.386
COMMENTATOR 1: The talking ends,
the action begins.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.547
Calzaghe against Hopkins.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:40.883
Twelve three-minute rounds.

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:47.101
A good right hand.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.650
Hopkins has put Calzaghe down
with the very first right.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:54.070
Calzaghe down with a clashing
right hand from Hopkins.

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:56.864
Six, seven, eight. You okay?

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:05.331
He goes down in the first
to a straight right hard,

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:06.624
and we're sort of metres away.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.874
You sort of hear the "thup", you go "thup".
Down he went, and we just went...

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:14.921
This is it. This is gonna end
how we hoped it never would.

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:22.470
Yeah.

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:26.311
COMMENTATOR 1:
The chant is "Wales, Wales".

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.809
Break! Break out, break out. Break out.

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.817
BRYCHAN ENGLAND: Bernard Hopkins
is a very clever boxer.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:34.895
It was a really frustrating
fight to watch 'cause___

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:36.359
Calzaghe couldn't get into his flow.

01:03:36.438 --> 01:03:38.111
-Couldn't get into his flow.
-He was just smothering him.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.904
Every chance, he was just closing him down.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:44.450
COMMENTATOR 1: Hopkins here,
he's constantly holding.

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:46.873
COMMENTATOR 2: He should be
getting warned now from the referee.

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:48.416
All right. Stop, stop, stop!

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:50.368
He's holding again.

01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:52.375
All right, break. Break! Step back.

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:56.425
ENZO: Joe knew already,
it's gonna be a nasty fight.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:58.926
And as it was,
it turned out to be that way.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.302
He went out to spoil Joe's style of boxing.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:22.944
COMMENTATOR 1: The movements...

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:25.244
Calzaghe needs a big round.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:34.003
COMMENTATOR 2: Calzaghe is
starting to make his left hand

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:35.672
produce music upstairs.

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:51.229
COMMENTATOR 1: I think the second and the
fifth rounds could have gone either way.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.978
It's difficult to come to a conclusion
as to who won the fight.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.700
COMMENTATOR 12 Better left hand, Calzaghe.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:16.671
COMMENTATOR 2: Joe Calzaghe
can finish the fight,

01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:20.797
having landed more punches
than anyone's ever landed against Hopkins

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.502
in a CompuBox counted fight.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.051
Down goes Hopkins on a low blow.

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:29.517
FOX; Hopkins is particularly
annoying to me.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:32.345
As a fight fan, I just the
hate defensive stuff,

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.602
and the slow down
and the grab and the clutch, and the...

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:36.900
I just can't stand that stuff.

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:39.103
And... And Joe was very anti-that.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.780
COMMENTATOR 2: I wonder
if Hopkins is choosing to stop

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.359
Calzaghe's flowing momentum here.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:48.616
Is it an Oscar-winning performance
or did Calzaghe land a foul?

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.156
COMMENTATOR 1 : Hopkins still grimacing.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:56.128
Calzaghe waving to the fans
suggesting this one is now going his way.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.721
Stop, stop. Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go.

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:18.892
COMMENTATOR 2: Hopkins is claiming
another low blow,

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.477
but Cortez didn't see it.

01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:39.628
ANNOUNCER: And the final round...

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.635
COMMENTATOR 1: This could be
a very difficult fight to score.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:50.386
COMMENTATOR 2: American judges
tend to favour aggression fighters-

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:51.808
Fighters who come forward.

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:53.635
Break! Break, break.

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:57.264
There was no real consensus
of who was winning the fight.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:01.102
And I can honestly say that
when the bell rang and it went to the cards

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:05.906
no one around me with any conviction
had an idea one way or the other who,

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.072
who was gonna get the decision.

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.244
Hopkins continues after the bell.

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:13.788
And both men celebrate.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.452
I'm okay, man.

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:27.544
ANNOUNCER: We go to the Scorecards.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:34.393
Adalaide Byrd scores it 114 to 113
for Bernard Hopkins.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:42.063
Ted Gimza scores it 115 to 112
for Joe Calzaghe.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:48.732
Chuck Giampa scores it 116-111.

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.489
To the winner by split decision,

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.411
from Newbridge, Wales,

01:07:55.989 --> 01:08:01.962
Joe...

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:06.424
Calzaghe!

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:10.379
COMMENTATOR 1: The celebrations,
the aggression has paid,

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.845
the judges have gone for the man
who forced the fight.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:18.975
And Joe Calzaghe has got off the floor
in the first round to win this one.

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:24.399
There were a few tears down there
when the verdict was delivered.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:28.317
From South Wales...
Oh, from Newbridge, South Wales!

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:29.693
Me and Joe, honestly, boy!

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.274
JOE JR: It was gone mad, mate.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:34.156
It took only five seconds,
but it felt like ages, man,

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.363
like, just waiting, like,
silence and then...

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:39.328
"The New Ring Magazine.-. "
Oh, man, it was amazing!

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:40.953
That was the best, weren't it, man?
That was good.

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:43.252
-Still gives me goose bumps, man.
-It was good.

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:45.421
Me and Giuseppe.

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:13.029
We Kept asking him if he was gonna retire,
but he kept, you know,

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:15.484
"Oh, one last fight. One last fight."

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.569
I just... I just wanted
him to retire, you know?

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.747
Yeah, after he got knocked down
as well in the first round.

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:23.956
Seeing him from knocking
all them people out and then, you Know,

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:27.585
him fighting in America and getting
knocked down in the first round again.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.416
Just don't want to go
through that ever again, man.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:32.048
It broke their heart
when they saw their father box.

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:34.629
-Connor, weren't he...
-It absolutely broke their heart.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:38.175
And they said to him,
"Please, Dad, please not again,

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:39.801
"I don't want to do it. Please, Dad."

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:43.721
I said, myself.
I said, "Don't retire."

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:48.067
I said, "Well, you can beat
Rocky Marciano's record by all means_"

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:50.395
He said, looked at me straight in my eyes,

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.069
"Dad, I lost the hunger."

01:09:57.652 --> 01:10:00.155
When I heard the words "I lost the hunger",

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:01.865
that to me was...

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:05.626
That's it.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.624
So...

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:15.213
You know, 25 years in a sport
as hard as boxing is a longtime.

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:18.514
And when your body's starting to break up,
which it was...

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:22.511
Pain, I couldn't spar.
Big massive pillows for gloves and...

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:26.853
You know, everything aches more and more,
and then, I think I was 36 at the time.

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:31.569
It was terribly important to Joe
that he was undefeated.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.984
And I think eventually,

01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:37.867
when you get the accumulative
problems with pain,

01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:40.828
difficulty in training for fights.

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:43.741
That inevitably leads you
to the point at which,

01:10:44.532 --> 01:10:47.581
"Am I going to be able
to get one more fight?"

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:53.629
One more fight too far may not
just be pain, it may be defeat.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:56.920
You got the sense
that he couldn't go on much longer.

01:10:57.044 --> 01:11:00.298
Because there was so much pressure
on him not losing.

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:04.310
The idea of having one in the loss column

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:06.433
was actually destroying him in...

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:09.023
In really deep psychological ways.

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:13.687
It made me feel that I got to be a father.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:18.157
I knew that enough is enough.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:22.904
I changed from trainer; become a father.

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:29.494
JOE: I didn't want to keep fighting
until I couldn't fight no more-

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.503
I wanted to fight with
something left in the tank.

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:35.671
I told my dad the next fight's
gonna be my last one.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:45.598
Who better to face than another
American ring legend, Roy Jones Junior.

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:51.058
A man the same size as Joe,
but when he steps into a ring,

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:57.068
he looks 6'6" because of his extraordinary
Wingspan and reach and speed.

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:03.198
Roy is ready.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:05.580
He's more ready now than he's ever been

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:09.668
in the fights that I've trained him
for the last, the last 18 years.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:13.671
DAVIES: There was no one else, really.
No one of that stature.

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:17.338
So far who's got the 45 and 0, mate?

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:19.544
Who's got the 45 and 0?

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:22.301
Stand up and praise Joe Calzaghe.
He's got 45 and 0.

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.554
And then on the fight night,
it's gonna be 46 and 0.

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:27.681
Put your hands together
for Joe Calzaghe, thank you.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:31.894
To finish off my career fighting one the
greatest fighters there's been, that's it!

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:35.560
And fighting in Madison Square Garden,
you know, that's all the motivation I need.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.278
On Saturday night,
you're not gonna see a good fight,

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.775
you're gonna see a great fight.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:43.072
DAVIES: No one wants to miss the end

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:48.156
of what has been an extraordinary,
and, remember, unbeaten career.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:52.665
But there's a fear
that the great Welsh champion,

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.875
the Italian Dragon might
lose his last fight.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:07.092
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
from the Mecca of boxing,

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:11.392
Madison Square Garden, New York City, USA.

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:20.442
Introducing first,
from Pensacola, Florida,

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:21.898
a future hall of fame

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:28.531
Roy Jones...

01:13:28.613 --> 01:13:31.617
Junior!

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:43.253
Introducing the fighting pride
of Newbridge, Wales,

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:47.512
former undisputed Super
Middleweight World Champion,

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:50.264
and reigning, defending,

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:55.982
undefeated Light Heavyweight
Champion of the World,

01:13:56.432 --> 01:14:01.359
Joe...

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.439
Calzaghe!

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:11.831
Twelve rounds of boxing

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:16.662
for the Light Heavyweight
Championship of the World.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.139
REFEREE: Okay, gentlemen, we went
over the rules in the dressing room.

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:31.138
Obey my commands at all times
and protect yourselves at all times.

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.352
Touch 'em up, when the bell rings,
come out fighting.

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:36.680
Okay, gentlemen.

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:39.521
Box!

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:45.240
COMMENTATOR: Joe Calzaghe,
Roy Jones Junion herein New York,

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:49.694
for the Ring Magazine Light
Heavyweight Championship of the World.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:01.376
I don't Know that Roy Jones
ever fought anybody

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:06.002
that was faster than he was
until he got in the ring with Joe.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:09.680
And I'm not sure that Joe ever fought
anybody who was faster than he was

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.507
until he got into the ring with Roy.

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:16.015
REFEREE: Okay, break.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:41.921
Foul; five, six, seven, eight...

01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:44.044
I, like, literally thought
my dad was Superman.

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:46.091
I thought he was like, invincible.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:49.178
We were in a frenzied state of terror.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:54.510
That it could all come undone, you know,
on the biggest stage of the boxing world.

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.285
COMMENTATOR: There's blood
on the bridge of Calzaghe's nose.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.283
Calzaghe has to dig out of a hole.

01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:36.850
ENZO: I can't put
the winning method in his life,

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.553
in his heart while he's boxing.

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:40.805
That comes from himself, personally.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:43.107
It's something that creeps in his mind.

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:44.809
"I shall not lose."

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.191
COMMENTATOR 2: Calzaghe unfazed.

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.026
Goes out with his hands out low.

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:59.574
Throws one punch at a time
and Calzaghe throws six.

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:13.759
Calzaghe showboating
in the centre of the ring.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:18.218
Never before have you seen that
with an opponent against Roy Jones.

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:21.221
Roy Jones Junior
was the ultimate showboater_

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:22.930
He could do everything.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:27.526
He could knock a man out five feet away
across a ring with a punch they never saw.

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:29.604
So, Joe begins to showboat.

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:33.032
He rolls his shoulders,
he shuffles, he does everything.

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:36.202
COMMENTATOR 1: And Calzaghe
is standing in front of Roy Jones

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:38.200
with his hands down, showboating.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.039
COMMENTATOR 2: it's abundantly clean
at least with body language,

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:44.995
Calzaghe is trying to portray
to the audience and to the judges

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:46.499
that he has weathered the storm.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.087
He has dominated round three.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:04.563
COMMENTATOR 1:
Another left hand by Calzaghe,

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:06.891
follows it up with a couple of body shots.

01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:10.148
Another flurry by Calzaghe.
Roy maybe momentarily hurt.

01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:11.319
COMMENTATOR 2: He's hurt, he's hurt...

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:13.944
COMMENTATOR 1:
Blood above the left eye of Roy Jones.

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:15.821
Joe was sticking his face out.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.494
He was sticking his face
out and just, just...

01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:23.500
Screwing with Roy's brain,
and Roy had done this for years to people.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.664
COMMENTATOR 1: Roy has never;
never experienced this,

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.545
and I think that the fact
that Joe can do this all night.

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:31.670
And then I was watching that,
I thought that's jazz. That's...

01:18:31.749 --> 01:18:36.175
It's smooth, it's silky, it's sneaky,
it's syncopated, it's just, it's just jazz.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:40.349
COMMENTATOR 1: Calzaghe
dropping his hands and staring at Jones

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:43.602
and watching the blood flow,
and going back to work.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:49.525
He did everything
but knock Roy Jones Junior out.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.477
And he probably was there for the taking.

01:18:52.811 --> 01:18:54.984
Why didn't Joe knock him out?

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:01.492
Maybe because he wanted
to savour those last 36 minutes.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.744
It was as if he was saying,
"I've loved this,

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:07.971
”l want you all to see
me be doing everything

01:19:07.984 --> 01:19:10.296
I can do here today
and it's goodbye. "

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:16.924
JOE: And it was as if my life was
flickering through, like, all my career;

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:18.003
like where I started.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.229
I was counting down the rounds in my head.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.732
Just looking round thinking,

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:36.317
”Look where I am. ”

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:04.072
JOE: To finish on my own terms,
money can't buy that.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.203
Money can't buy that.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:20.085
DAVIES: Very few fighters go out
on their terms in that way.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:24.050
I can literally name on five fingers

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:27.300
the fighters in my era that have
gotten out with their faculties,

01:21:27.341 --> 01:21:29.218
with their money, and with their pride.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:35.815
I give him a lot of credit.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.235
And it says a lot about his sense of self

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:40.896
and the understanding he had,

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:44.574
that he had more than
half his life still to live, after boxing.

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:49.029
BRADFIELD: People still talk about him,

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:51.657
and people kind of still
want him to be around,

01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:55.502
you know, and there are not many
people that once they go away,

01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:57.713
you know, the only thing
people will start talking about is,

01:21:57.788 --> 01:22:00.007
just like, you know,
"l wish he was still here", you Know.

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:01.459
That's a big achievement.

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:16.231
If I had flags, I would put the flags out.
It was really...

01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:19.109
Well, you see now I've just...

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:25.324
JOE JR: It was unreal seeing my dad
after all he's done, really be appreciated.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:27.743
I just felt like
that was the best moment ever.

01:22:27.818 --> 01:22:30.913
So proud of him, like,
that's probably my proudest moment ever.

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:39.087
I respect him as a father
for what he's done for us.

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:43.376
Nobody knows
what my dad went through to get,

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.136
to get there, from a little kid.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.218
That's, that's what I feel, you Know.

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:54.887
INTERVIEWER: You wanna come in, Joe?

01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:14.994
ENZO: Never happened, it wasn't us,
it couldn't be us, no way.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:17.834
Look at the memories,
that's there, it's us.

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:25.626
JOE: Oh, he's my best friend and
a great dad, and he's an awesome trainer.

01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:28.512
I couldn't pay him back for the way
he brought me up

01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:32.217
and also for instilling that animal in me

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:33.846
that I become in the ring,

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:37.270
who refused to be beat,
refused to be knocked down.

01:23:41.475 --> 01:23:44.194
If you get knocked down,
you get back twice as bad.

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:46.314
That Was me.

01:23:46.647 --> 01:23:48.149
Refuse to lose.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:51.406
That was instilled in me, so thanks, Dad.

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:15.225
JOE: Oh, it's been a brilliant ride,

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.053
and I'm a happy man now
and I'm thankful for everything I've got.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:22.267
Nothing's come close to the family,
children and health.

01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:24.898
Nothing matters unless you got that.

01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:31.650
ENZO: You'll never be forgotten.

01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:34.827
What you are is eternal.

01:25:59.863 --> 01:26:01.740
Hey, listen, Joe put in a lot of work.

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:04.622
He fought a lot of tough guys. He um...

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.539
He beat the odds, you know, he has um...

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:10.757
He's beat the who's-who
of his division of his time.

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:14.382
He chose to retire early, that's on him.
He's still, you know...

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:16.838
I believe he still has a
lot of good fight left.

01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:20.392
You know, Flock would have been
a great fight for him.

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:23.766
Um, in England, Wales, one of those arenas.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:26.724
That would have been
a financial moneybreaker_

01:26:26.807 --> 01:26:28.184
It would have broke some records.

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:31.145
But, you know, he chose to retire early.
I have much respect for him.

01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:36.576
Matter of fact, um, he got his bones of
becoming a confident fighter under my cards

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:39.077
when I fought in Europe.

01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:43.578
He fought in all the undercards
and looked sensational then as well.

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:48.629
I think he's the greatest British fighter
we've ever had, to be honest with you.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:51.378
And he's a great fighter,
a great mechanic in the ring.

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:54.468
And he understands what it is to win.

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:57.925
He totally eradicated the word "losing"
out of his vocabulary.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:01.805
He comes from a division where in England
we had a wonderful name back in the day

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.726
with Ben, Eubank, and, you know.

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:05.427
I mean, to have your dad
in your corner, you

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.931
know you're not going
to get ripped off.

01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:08.230
You've got your old man there
who loves you.

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:11.901
Your father don't let you side down.
Father knows who you are.

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.071
There's always a strong bond.

01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:17.195
One of the most important things in boxing
is the bond between trainer and...

01:27:17.315 --> 01:27:20.319
And when your father, you Know,
when you look in his eyes, he's obviously.

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:22.496
You know, the truth is there.

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:25.495
Well, it's always going to be different
strokes for different folks.

01:27:25.615 --> 01:27:31.122
For Tito Trinidad and his dad,
same thing as Enzo and Joe.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:35.084
You've got something there
that's family or tie.

01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:36.334
They both respect each other.

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:41.182
They respect the boundaries
of each other's ideologies, of course.

01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:44.764
And so, that makes it just...
It just looks good, you know.

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:49.519
Very rarely, at the end of the game,
it looks good. It still looks good.

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:51.267
I think he could have gone on.

01:27:51.349 --> 01:27:55.024
I think he could have gone out there
and smashed...

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.272
I think he could still do it now.

01:27:57.355 --> 01:27:59.858
I can only beat the old man.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.823
Where's your son? Where's your son?

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:08.959
Congratulations, Joe. God bless.
Just keep on keeping on. I love you.

01:28:09.367 --> 01:28:12.621
He's got the life now. He doesn't
have to... He's living the life.
