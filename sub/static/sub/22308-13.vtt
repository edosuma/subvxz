Welcome to Paramount Ranch's

02:18.669 --> 02:21.237
These dusty streets
were a popular stomping ground

02:21.271 --> 02:24.474
for jangling spurs

<i>The Wild Wild West.</i>

This classic series took stock
characters of the old West

02:47.231 --> 02:49.599

your spotlight challenge,

03:02.780 --> 03:05.715
I want you to take things
a step further

03:05.749 --> 03:09.218
by reimagining a classic
Western character

03:09.253 --> 03:11.854
as a steampunk cyborg.

03:11.889 --> 03:13.389
Oh, man.

03:13.424 --> 03:15.591
I do really dig steampunk,

03:15.626 --> 03:17.026
and I know this is
an opportunity

03:17.060 --> 03:18.394
to fabricate something.

03:18.429 --> 03:21.330
So I'm really excited.
This is a dream challenge.

03:21.365 --> 03:23.866
Now, throughout this ranch
are the typical establishments

03:23.901 --> 03:26.302
you'd expect to see
in the old West.

03:26.336 --> 03:29.806
And each one represents
a classic Western character.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.575
So if you pick the saloon,
you'll be making a barmaid.

03:32.609 --> 03:34.911
The undertaker's parlor,
an undertaker.

03:34.945 --> 03:36.813
The bank equals a bank robber.

03:36.847 --> 03:38.881
The jail represents the sheriff.

03:38.916 --> 03:40.716
And the blacksmith
is exactly that.

03:40.751 --> 03:42.485
A blacksmith.

03:42.519 --> 03:45.588
Now, before you get started,
I know what you're thinking.

03:45.622 --> 03:47.123
Steampunk is not easy,

03:47.157 --> 03:50.460
because it's such a specific
and intricate space.

03:50.494 --> 03:52.228
Well, don't worry, guys.
I always have your back.

03:52.262 --> 03:54.530

- Thanks for being here.
- Thank you for having me.

04:10.347 --> 04:13.916
Every season, the artists are
terrified of doing steampunk,

04:13.951 --> 04:15.251
because they know what I know.

04:15.285 --> 04:18.019
Glenn is intimately familiar
with this world.

04:18.055 --> 04:19.622
So I thought I'd have him
come out here today

04:19.656 --> 04:21.858
to talk to you about where
people go wrong,

04:21.892 --> 04:23.226
and how to get it right.

04:23.260 --> 04:25.094
(Glenn) At the core of
the steampunk aesthetic

04:25.128 --> 04:26.863
is a combination of two
elements,

04:26.897 --> 04:29.265
a Victorian or Edwardian
fashion sense,

04:29.299 --> 04:31.968
combined with antediluvian
technology.

04:32.002 --> 04:33.503
What that means is,

04:33.537 --> 04:36.339
technology from a previous
civilization

04:36.373 --> 04:37.640
that has been rediscovered

04:37.674 --> 04:39.308
and is now powered with steam.

04:39.343 --> 04:41.611
And exceedingly important

04:41.645 --> 04:44.180
is making everything look
like it has a purpose.

04:44.214 --> 04:48.117
Do not give gears or rivet
brass plates

04:48.151 --> 04:50.486
onto an area that doesn't
make any sense.

04:50.521 --> 04:52.355
It must look like it works.

04:52.389 --> 04:54.290
I'm not a fan of steampunk,

04:54.324 --> 04:55.758
and I don't watch Westerns.

04:55.792 --> 04:58.361
I get what cyborgs are,

04:58.395 --> 05:00.263
but to then factor in
these other two elements?

05:00.297 --> 05:02.798
This is going to be a rough one.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.634
I'd go stake your claim

05:04.668 --> 05:06.335
on one of the storefronts

05:06.370 --> 05:08.070
by removing the ring of keys
out front,

05:08.105 --> 05:09.639
and then get started
on your designs.

05:09.673 --> 05:12.241
Remember, guys,
this is your last chance

05:12.276 --> 05:14.744
to prove to the judges
that you deserve

05:14.778 --> 05:16.312
to make it to the finale.

05:16.346 --> 05:19.148
On my mark, get set, go.

Drinks.

05:25.822 --> 05:27.823
My character's a barmaid.

05:27.858 --> 05:29.992
She's going to be sexy,
but also hard core.

05:30.027 --> 05:33.429
Most important is to sell
the idea that she's a cyborg

05:33.463 --> 05:35.798
underneath and over the top
of the flesh.

05:35.832 --> 05:37.767
This is an opportunity
for me to fabricate

05:37.801 --> 05:40.069
a mechanical arm that she could
serve drinks from,

05:40.103 --> 05:42.605
with a tank on top
and some gauges on it

05:42.639 --> 05:44.273
to tell you how much is left.

05:44.308 --> 05:46.409
I want this to be the best
character I've made so far.

05:52.049 --> 05:56.586
These are all genres that
I'm not very comfortable with.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.721
I picked the keys
for the blacksmith,

05:58.755 --> 06:01.457
and I have absolutely no idea
where to start

06:01.491 --> 06:02.658
with this character.

06:02.693 --> 06:03.926
It's really stressful,

06:03.961 --> 06:05.761
because this is
the last challenge

06:05.796 --> 06:07.096
before the finale.

06:07.130 --> 06:09.332
And if I can't come up
with a design,

06:09.366 --> 06:12.468
that could be it for me.
And I don't want to go home yet.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.075
I got the steampunk bank robber.

06:19.109 --> 06:20.576
He's kind of an expert thief.

06:20.611 --> 06:23.279
He's going to have a cyborg arm

06:23.313 --> 06:25.848
that is also his weapon.

06:25.882 --> 06:28.818
I know Glenn's going to be
looking for originality.

06:28.852 --> 06:30.386
It's going to be really tough
to impress him,

06:30.420 --> 06:32.421
so I want to make sure
I go all out.

06:34.858 --> 06:36.359
I don't do robots.

06:36.393 --> 06:37.660
I'm not familiar with them.

06:37.694 --> 06:39.328
But reading about it,

06:39.363 --> 06:40.696
the undertakers
make the coffins,

06:40.731 --> 06:42.665
they dress the bodies,
they bury them.

06:42.699 --> 06:43.866
Because it's a cyborg,

06:43.900 --> 06:45.635
I want to break up
the human form,

06:45.669 --> 06:47.536
and I'm going to go
with a coffin shape.

06:47.571 --> 06:50.072
I want to be in this finale

06:50.107 --> 06:52.808
I cannot be the one
eliminated on this.

In the entire time

06:58.181 --> 07:00.549

thinking about our characters,

07:00.584 --> 07:02.752
I don't come up with anything.

07:02.786 --> 07:04.654
And that's really scary.

on this.

And then I go to my station
and start sculpting the chest.

07:32.716 --> 07:35.985
I'm going to make a coffin chest
to break up the human form.

07:36.019 --> 07:38.487
I'm not really too sure what
I'm going to do for the face.

07:38.522 --> 07:40.489
I'm just going to focus

07:46.563 --> 07:49.732
Old West barmaids

08:10.353 --> 08:13.489
Other people seem like
they've got a direction,

08:13.523 --> 08:15.157
and I still don't.

08:15.192 --> 08:18.861
The first thing I do
is gather some materials

08:18.895 --> 08:21.697
so that it gives me a few more
minutes to think about it.

08:21.732 --> 08:25.701
But I really need
to get this nailed down.

08:25.736 --> 08:27.403
Ooh, it's hot out.

08:27.437 --> 08:28.938
I got a barmaid.

08:28.972 --> 08:30.973
Okay.

08:31.007 --> 08:33.842
My only concern
is the size of the hoots.

08:33.876 --> 08:35.376
And with all the other
things to do,

08:35.412 --> 08:40.448
is sculpting a nice set
of hoots, like, the way to go?

08:40.484 --> 08:42.083
It really is ridiculous,
Rayce points out,

08:42.119 --> 08:44.620
that it's just a waste of time.
So we scrap it.

08:46.723 --> 08:50.025
I think Logan definitely has
the ability to go to the finale.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.094
He reminds me a lot of myself,

08:52.129 --> 08:54.764
coming in with not
a lot of experience

08:54.798 --> 08:59.068
and having to learn an insane
amount every challenge.

08:59.102 --> 09:01.937

09:01.972 --> 09:04.974
but I'm happy I got Logan.

09:05.008 --> 09:07.209
- Hey, what's going on?
- Well, I got a bank robber.

09:07.244 --> 09:08.744
Yeah, that's exciting.

09:08.779 --> 09:10.246
Laura and I start talking
about the concept,

09:10.280 --> 09:13.315
and I start telling her
exactly what I want.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.784
And because I don't know
how to draw,

09:14.818 --> 09:17.186
she draws out
what I'm describing.

09:17.220 --> 09:20.723
- Do you do much fabrication?
- No.

09:20.757 --> 09:23.058
Julian's got
a lot of fabrication,

09:23.093 --> 09:24.860
something that he's never
done before.

09:24.895 --> 09:28.164
But if he leaves himself enough
time to do that fabrication,

09:28.198 --> 09:29.799
I'm sure he can pull
something good off.

09:29.833 --> 09:33.068
- All right, have fun with the L200.
- Well, yeah.

09:36.439 --> 09:38.741
- So you got blacksmith.
- Blacksmith.

09:38.775 --> 09:41.577
Trying to get myself
in some sort of direction.

09:41.611 --> 09:45.714
At this point, I started coming
up with potential concept ideas.

09:45.749 --> 09:49.084
He heaps the metal
somewhere inside of him.

09:49.119 --> 09:50.753
Yeah!

09:50.787 --> 09:52.988
I like the idea
of this blacksmith

09:53.023 --> 09:55.424
who replaced his heart
with a forge.

09:55.458 --> 09:59.295
And he has an iron jaw
embedded into his flesh.

09:59.329 --> 10:01.297
I like that.
That makes a great silhouette.

10:01.331 --> 10:02.698
- Okay.
- And it gives him

10:02.732 --> 10:04.366
kind of a menacing look as well.

10:04.401 --> 10:06.902
It's kind of silly,
but it's something.

10:06.937 --> 10:08.137
It's better than... you know,

10:08.171 --> 10:10.139
it's better than not having
a concept.

10:10.173 --> 10:14.176
I work on the chest
for about 2 1/2 hours.

10:14.211 --> 10:17.179
And I'm ready to mold.

10:17.214 --> 10:19.815
I need to get
this chest out today,

10:19.850 --> 10:21.550

- Hi.

I chose the salon,
which is the barmaid.

10:28.892 --> 10:31.427

- I have not done much.

- Okay.
- And I do need to work on that.

This is the type of makeup

- Right.

She can have eyeliner.
You can use lashes.

You can have red lipstick
to really kind of bring it out.

- Good luck.

into some type of weapon.

10:49.446 --> 10:52.681

that rotates like a gun barrel.

don't worry about it rotating.

he has the ability to shoot,

and I impregnate
the clay with them.

It's application day,

to do this makeup.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.498
I have to do the fastest
application as I possibly can,

20:25.533 --> 20:27.167
- so I can spend the rest of the time on...
- Awesome!

20:27.201 --> 20:29.936
- Painting and stuff.
- finishing this thing.

20:29.970 --> 20:32.338
Logan got as far as he could
on the fabricated arm.

to put it all together

20:36.644 --> 20:38.912
and leave time for those
all-important details?

20:38.946 --> 20:40.380
Well, I'm going
to do it in an hour,

20:40.414 --> 20:42.382

20:46.287 --> 20:47.253
How are you?

20:47.288 --> 20:48.688
I've got some stuff to do

20:48.723 --> 20:50.790
before I'm gonna
be starting on you at all.

20:50.825 --> 20:52.826

I'm not quite ready

20:52.860 --> 20:54.227
to start application,

20:54.261 --> 20:57.063
because I still have a fair
amount of fabrication to do.

20:57.098 --> 21:00.200
Once I get all the pieces
of the armor glued down,

21:00.234 --> 21:02.102
I take it back
to the spray booth

21:02.136 --> 21:05.238
and spray-paint
the whole thing black.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.308
(Logan)
What are you staring at?

21:08.342 --> 21:10.477
(Rayce) Just the symmetry
of the cheekbones.

21:10.511 --> 21:12.679
The right side of his prosthetic

21:12.713 --> 21:15.115
looks really, really weird.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.483
There's something
definitely off.

21:16.517 --> 21:18.017
You make me nervous

21:18.052 --> 21:20.620
when you stand there
staring quietly.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.455
This one's
in the wrong spot, so...

21:22.490 --> 21:24.524
With this character,
where she has to be beautiful,

21:24.558 --> 21:26.526
you have to make sure
that these prosthetics

21:26.560 --> 21:28.428
are wonderfully symmetrical.

21:28.462 --> 21:30.163
That should be further down.

21:30.197 --> 21:32.132
The whole thing
needs to go like this.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.200
This side is crooked,
and he's absolutely right.

21:34.235 --> 21:35.902
It's coming off.

21:35.936 --> 21:39.005
But I'm in a frenzy, because
there's a lot of work to do.

21:39.039 --> 21:41.207
(Rayce) - Come down a little bit. (Logan)
Yeah, that's better.

21:48.115 --> 21:49.916
I apply the face to my model,

21:49.950 --> 21:51.951
and my edges are kind of wonky.

21:51.986 --> 21:53.753
And if I try to do
a realistic flesh tone,

21:53.788 --> 21:55.655
it's going to look silly.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.991
So instead of going
with a realistic character,

21:58.025 --> 22:00.426
I'm going to go
with a stylized character.

22:00.461 --> 22:04.297
I use the Kryolan aqua color
to create corrosive skin,

22:04.331 --> 22:07.433
the same texture that I used
for the rust on the chest.

22:12.239 --> 22:14.174
If I can color-match him,
then I don't have to worry

22:14.208 --> 22:16.309
- about painting his arms.
- Yeah.

22:16.343 --> 22:19.712
Getting natural-looking
skin tone is pretty difficult,

22:19.747 --> 22:22.182
because skin is very
translucent.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.651
And when you're painting
on a foam piece,

22:24.685 --> 22:26.786
there's no translucency
whatsoever.

22:26.821 --> 22:31.357
So the trick is to do
multiple layers of washes,

22:31.392 --> 22:34.761
flecking and airbrushing
and veining and mottling.

22:34.795 --> 22:38.364
So I'm just flecking
as fast as I can.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.333
Time to patch you up.

22:40.367 --> 22:42.869
Everything gets laid down,
and it's time to start blending.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.604
Blending is key here.

22:44.638 --> 22:46.472
I'm just really worried
about that chest piece

22:46.507 --> 22:49.876
being all gross
and crazy-looking.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.711
The chest piece area
is starting to look

22:51.745 --> 22:53.680
a little bit gross,

22:53.714 --> 22:56.049
and that is absolutely not
what I want of this character.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.817
It's got to be beautiful.

22:57.852 --> 22:59.385
So I started blending edges
with Cabo-Patch.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.354
And I go over it
and over it again.

23:01.388 --> 23:02.755
(Rayce) So you've
got an hour left.

23:02.790 --> 23:04.891
Maybe just continue
to make that chest work,

23:04.925 --> 23:07.760
because another thing
is every time she moves,

23:07.795 --> 23:10.430
this neck is crinkling
and mushing.

23:10.464 --> 23:11.998
I'm already behind schedule.

23:12.032 --> 23:14.334
Now I'm actually worried
about the makeup.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.539
It's almost the end
of application,

23:19.573 --> 23:21.975
and I'm falling behind.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.543
I still have to figure out
how I'm going to get

23:23.577 --> 23:26.346
this giant armor
to look steampunk.

23:26.380 --> 23:27.547
Pour into there.

23:27.581 --> 23:29.382
Make a nice little
oatmeal consistency.

23:29.416 --> 23:32.852
Luckily, Laura suggested
mixing corn meal

23:32.887 --> 23:36.055
and latex together,
and then smear it onto the armor

23:36.090 --> 23:37.690
just to give that rusted look.

23:37.725 --> 23:40.293
And painting on top of that.
It is a really cool effect.

23:40.327 --> 23:41.661
I think you got,
like, 20 minutes.

23:41.695 --> 23:43.396
So take a minute to pack up.

23:43.430 --> 23:45.932
I only have the first layer

23:45.966 --> 23:48.735
of the PAX skin tone base
on the model.

23:48.769 --> 23:50.236
And I still have a ton
of work to do.

23:50.271 --> 23:51.704
So I'm going
to have to prioritize

31:44.654 --> 31:46.822
behind your steampunk-inspired
blacksmith.

31:46.856 --> 31:49.425
He took out his heart
and replaced it with a forge,

31:49.459 --> 31:52.461
so that he could focus
on his work.

31:52.495 --> 31:54.196
Pretty much every element
of this challenge

31:54.230 --> 31:56.332
was outside my comfort zone,
but all that considered,

31:56.366 --> 31:57.866
I'm pretty happy with it.

31:57.901 --> 32:01.036
I see your self-questioning
present in this week's work.

32:01.071 --> 32:04.440
But I do really like
the overall look.

32:04.474 --> 32:06.241
Thank you.

32:06.276 --> 32:07.643
What I like about your makeup

32:07.677 --> 32:11.814
is the core theme
is center to the character.

32:11.848 --> 32:14.383
It is a very clean character.

32:14.417 --> 32:16.185
I would have liked to have seen
just a little scroll work

32:16.219 --> 32:17.686
on this jaw piece,

32:17.721 --> 32:18.921
or some riveting or something,

32:18.955 --> 32:20.623
because this part up here
is very plain.

32:20.657 --> 32:23.058
And I do like the addition
of the sweat.

32:23.093 --> 32:24.393
That was a really nice touch.

32:24.427 --> 32:26.962
That really helps with the theme
of being the blacksmith.

32:26.997 --> 32:29.365
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Nice job.

32:29.399 --> 32:33.702
He's got a cool look overall.
The skin growing over the piece,

32:33.737 --> 32:35.537
that takes the character
to a whole new level.

32:35.572 --> 32:37.906
Thank you.

32:37.941 --> 32:38.974
Darla, you can step down.

32:39.009 --> 32:41.243
Thanks, Alex.

32:46.116 --> 32:48.183
Julian, you're next.

32:54.724 --> 32:56.692
Julian, tell me about
your bank-robbing,

32:56.726 --> 33:00.362
cowboy steampunk cyborg.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.364
My character originally
started out as a miner.

33:02.399 --> 33:03.966
There was an accident,

33:04.000 --> 33:05.367
and all the mechanics
on the top of the head

33:05.402 --> 33:06.568
are keeping him alive.

33:06.603 --> 33:08.771
It was my first time
working with L200.

33:08.805 --> 33:13.042
Well, I do love me a cowboy,
so I do like this character.

33:13.076 --> 33:14.510
I do like the scar on the face,

33:14.544 --> 33:17.780
but the sculpting
doesn't look like flesh.

33:17.814 --> 33:19.648
I think your greatest success
on this one

33:19.683 --> 33:22.818
is the overall silhouette.

33:22.852 --> 33:26.922
But the brain feels like
bits and pieces just glued on.

33:28.358 --> 33:30.726
I think you did a great job
embracing the Western aesthetic

33:30.760 --> 33:32.361
of what we were talking about.

33:32.395 --> 33:33.729
And I love the reveal
with the hat.

33:33.763 --> 33:34.963
But one of my problems
with the makeup

33:34.998 --> 33:36.231
is the top of his head
is too high.

33:36.266 --> 33:38.834
Some really great things.
Some other things

33:38.868 --> 33:41.870
that I've got to sort
of pick apart a little bit.

33:41.905 --> 33:43.706
Julian, please step down.

33:43.740 --> 33:45.674
Thanks.
Thanks, guys.

33:52.582 --> 33:55.551
Emily, please step up.

33:59.456 --> 34:02.124
Oh, gosh.

34:02.158 --> 34:04.026
So, tell us about your
steampunk character, please.

34:04.060 --> 34:06.261
He's a mortician.
He's not very familiar

34:06.296 --> 34:07.996
with the chemicals they use
to embalm the bodies.

34:08.031 --> 34:10.364
Mixing them corroded the metal,

34:10.400 --> 34:12.201
and his skin's starting
to turn to metal.

34:12.235 --> 34:14.937
The overall color of this
is so beautiful and harmonious.

34:16.940 --> 34:19.308
I just love the fact
that he's become so oxidized

34:19.342 --> 34:23.178
and so patina'd
by this chemical reaction,

34:23.213 --> 34:25.914
which I think
is really quite nice.

34:25.949 --> 34:28.417
- Thank you.
- What are the bottles

34:28.451 --> 34:29.784
on his chest made of?

34:29.819 --> 34:32.020
I found baby powder bottles.

34:32.054 --> 34:33.956
I just... I vacuformed it

34:33.989 --> 34:36.625
and used hair gel, and I just
tinted it with acrylic paint.

34:36.659 --> 34:37.826
Is this something
you've done before?

34:37.860 --> 34:39.194
No.

34:39.228 --> 34:41.463
There's a lot of overwhelmingly
genius decisions

34:41.498 --> 34:42.864
that you're making
to do things quick,

34:42.899 --> 34:46.869
and it works out
extraordinarily well.

34:46.902 --> 34:49.371
The texture of the skin
is really cool.

34:49.405 --> 34:50.973
And I love the fact
that the paint's

34:51.007 --> 34:53.408
all sort of dark
around the hairline,

34:53.443 --> 34:55.177
so it's burnt out, smoked out.

34:55.210 --> 34:56.779
It's really pretty, honey.

34:56.813 --> 34:58.313
Thank you.

34:58.348 --> 35:01.583
- Emily, you can head back.
- Thank you. Thanks, Marcus.

35:01.618 --> 35:04.319
- Good job. - Nice job.
- Thanks. Thanks.

35:06.156 --> 35:08.390
All right, let's talk to Logan.

35:16.166 --> 35:19.067
Logan, tell us about how you
used the steampunk aesthetic

35:19.102 --> 35:21.036
on your barmaid character.

35:21.070 --> 35:22.671
She's classic barmaid.

35:22.705 --> 35:26.775
She serves drinks
through her arm device here.

35:26.810 --> 35:28.744
And what about the filigree
on her forehead?

35:28.778 --> 35:30.112
Filigree
was hand-sculpted.

35:30.146 --> 35:32.681
Well, I think that
in and of itself is impressive.

35:32.715 --> 35:37.719
I also think it's an incredibly
articulate conveyance

35:37.754 --> 35:40.889
of that archaic technology
that we were talking about.

35:40.924 --> 35:42.424
What I do not think is great

35:42.458 --> 35:43.692
is some of the edging
and blending work

35:43.726 --> 35:45.360
from her breast to her chest.

35:45.395 --> 35:47.996
Really rough.

35:48.031 --> 35:49.698
I really like this character.

35:49.732 --> 35:51.433
It's so unfortunate that you had

35:51.467 --> 35:53.802
so many problems
in this area right here,

35:53.837 --> 35:55.704
because this is a mess.

35:55.738 --> 35:58.006
But I think the design of it
is really cool.

35:58.041 --> 36:01.076
And I love this headpiece.

36:01.110 --> 36:03.412
To do filigree right
takes time and patience.

36:03.446 --> 36:05.447
So it's impressive that you
pulled off what you did

36:05.481 --> 36:06.748
with that piece alone.

36:06.783 --> 36:08.884
Thank you.

36:08.918 --> 36:11.587
- Logan, you can head back.
- Thanks.

36:15.325 --> 36:16.892
All right, you guys can all
head back to the makeup room

36:16.926 --> 36:20.262
while the judges decide
who will move on to the finale.

36:20.296 --> 36:22.931
Oh, my God.

36:27.604 --> 36:28.971
All right, judges.

36:29.005 --> 36:31.173
Well, you have some
big decisions to make.

36:31.207 --> 36:32.975
Why don't we start with Darla.

36:33.009 --> 36:35.944
(Ve) Well, Darla did another
exceptional application

36:35.979 --> 36:37.946
and a beautiful sculpt.

36:37.981 --> 36:40.349
I think it was missing
a little bit

36:40.383 --> 36:43.085
of some of the steampunk
componentry

36:43.119 --> 36:45.153
that we would have liked
to have seen.

36:45.188 --> 36:47.823
But all in all,
it was a pretty solid character.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.458
(Glenn)
And it was painted beautifully.

36:49.492 --> 36:51.727
The chin piece
was beautifully executed.

36:51.761 --> 36:54.596
And she did that one extra
fine little detail

36:54.631 --> 36:57.366
that we've so rarely seen,
sweat.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.701
All right, judges,
let's move on to Julian.

36:59.736 --> 37:01.436
(Ve)
He really worked hard

37:01.471 --> 37:03.272
at getting that whole
cowboy aesthetic down.

37:03.306 --> 37:04.940
And he did a really great job
at them.

37:04.974 --> 37:06.608
The dirtiness of the clothes

37:06.643 --> 37:08.176
really pulled
that whole thing together.

37:08.211 --> 37:10.846
(Glenn) The concept, with
his arm being augmented,

37:10.880 --> 37:12.047
that's right-thinking.

37:12.081 --> 37:14.917
The execution of it
was lacking precision.

37:14.951 --> 37:17.252
But it was his first time
using L200.

37:17.287 --> 37:19.054
- That's pretty courageous.
- Yeah.

37:19.088 --> 37:20.689
All right, let's move on
to Emily.

37:20.723 --> 37:23.525
(Ve) This little girl is
absolutely phenomenal.

37:23.559 --> 37:25.427
(Glenn)
She completed an entire makeup

37:25.461 --> 37:26.962
with sort of the half face,

37:26.996 --> 37:28.797
and then all this mangled
jaw area

37:28.831 --> 37:31.300
that facilitated in putting
her steampunk elements over.

37:31.334 --> 37:32.534
Okay, that's really smart.

37:32.568 --> 37:34.536
Emily is fearless
in three categories...

37:34.570 --> 37:37.973
fabrication, concept and form.

37:38.007 --> 37:42.277
That kind of range is,
at any age, admirable.

37:42.312 --> 37:45.314
All right,
let's move on to Logan.

37:45.348 --> 37:47.249
(Ve)
Cool barmaid. Bitching arm.

37:47.283 --> 37:50.886
(Neville) He achieved one of the
most steampunk-looking objects.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.822
(Glenn) He insculpted that
filigree on the plate in her head,

37:53.856 --> 37:55.490
and the way that it just
divides her face in half.

37:55.525 --> 37:57.893
It's all beautifully
encapsulated

37:57.927 --> 37:59.094
within the human form.

37:59.128 --> 38:01.063
As much as I love the design,

38:01.097 --> 38:03.231
he should have thought
about that chest piece

38:03.266 --> 38:05.968
right out there in the middle
of her body.

38:06.002 --> 38:07.803
Blatantly bad edges.

38:07.837 --> 38:11.540
As a design,
this is on the right track.

38:11.574 --> 38:13.108
Incredibly tough
decision this year.

38:13.142 --> 38:15.344
This is one of the closest
it's ever been.

38:15.378 --> 38:16.678
All right, judges.

38:16.713 --> 38:18.113
Have you chosen
your final three, then?

38:18.147 --> 38:19.848
Yes, we have.

38:19.882 --> 38:22.084
Let's bring them back out.

38:30.426 --> 38:31.827
Welcome back, guys.

38:31.861 --> 38:34.763
It's time to find out
who is moving forward.

38:34.797 --> 38:37.899
So, Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge,

38:37.934 --> 38:40.802
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

38:40.837 --> 38:42.437
The winner of tonight's
challenge,

38:42.472 --> 38:45.173
and the first person
moving on to the finale is...

38:52.893 --> 38:55.262
So, Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge,

38:55.296 --> 38:58.164
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

38:58.199 --> 38:59.933
The winner of tonight's
challenge,

38:59.967 --> 39:02.602
and the first person
moving on to the finale is...

39:06.374 --> 39:10.043
Emily.

39:10.077 --> 39:12.746
Oh, my God.

39:12.780 --> 39:14.014
(Glenn)
We love the weathered

39:14.048 --> 39:15.915
and oxidized paint
on your character.

39:15.950 --> 39:18.351
Though he was not
traditionally steampunk,

39:18.386 --> 39:20.453
he still very much
evoked that world.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.756
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39:24.075 --> 39:25.759
I'm going to start to cry.

39:25.793 --> 39:27.427
What?

39:27.461 --> 39:31.865
I'm the youngest person
to ever be on <i> Face Off,</i>

39:31.899 --> 39:33.199
and I'm in the finale.

39:33.234 --> 39:35.201
It's so awesome.

39:35.236 --> 39:37.437
I will never forget the way
I'm feeling right now.

39:37.471 --> 39:38.972
Emily, congratulations.

39:39.006 --> 39:41.508
You have earned the first spot
in the finale.

39:41.542 --> 39:43.009
Thank you.

39:43.044 --> 39:46.146
Glenn, who is the next
person to make it to the finale?

39:46.180 --> 39:48.448
The second person that will be
joining us in the finale is...

39:53.587 --> 39:54.654
Darla.

39:54.689 --> 39:57.557
[clapping]

39:58.658 --> 39:59.727
Thank you.

40:00.394 --> 40:01.828
Oh.

40:01.862 --> 40:03.363
(Glenn)
We really liked your choice

40:03.397 --> 40:04.831
to make the blacksmith
profession

40:04.865 --> 40:06.566
the central component
of your character.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.201
And you delivered, once again,

40:08.235 --> 40:09.803
your signature style.

40:09.837 --> 40:11.938
A beautifully clean,
finished makeup.

40:11.972 --> 40:13.306
Thank you so much.

40:13.341 --> 40:15.108
I don't even know what to say.

40:15.142 --> 40:17.243
I am shocked. I'm in.

40:17.278 --> 40:19.713
I made it to the finale.

40:19.747 --> 40:21.614
And that is the most
incredible thing.

40:21.649 --> 40:23.383
Congratulations, Darla.

40:23.417 --> 40:26.820
You've earned the second spot
in our finale.

40:26.854 --> 40:28.722
All right, guys,
this is the hard part.

40:28.756 --> 40:30.023
We have two artists left,

40:30.057 --> 40:32.992
and only one of you
can join us in the finale.

40:33.027 --> 40:36.329
Glenn, who has earned
the last spot?

40:36.364 --> 40:38.765
I do really want this spot.

40:38.799 --> 40:40.500
I'm hoping that
they call my name.

40:40.534 --> 40:42.335
I'm ready to go further.

40:42.370 --> 40:44.704
More than anything,
I want a chance to prove

40:44.739 --> 40:48.641
that I can do some of the things
that they think I failed at.

40:48.676 --> 40:50.176
I also don't want
to let Rayce down.

40:50.211 --> 40:53.747
This was an awfully
difficult decision.

40:53.781 --> 40:57.183
The third and final spot
goes to...

41:01.021 --> 41:02.422
Logan.

41:02.456 --> 41:05.425
[clapping]

41:06.694 --> 41:08.461
The overall aesthetic
of your barmaid

41:08.496 --> 41:09.963
felt really well-conceived,

41:09.997 --> 41:13.199
and the sculpted filigree work,
particularly on her forehead,

41:13.234 --> 41:15.335
was just really beautiful.

41:15.369 --> 41:16.536
Thank you.

41:16.570 --> 41:17.704
I'm incredibly grateful.

41:17.738 --> 41:18.905
This is where I've been hoping

41:18.939 --> 41:20.106
to get to the whole time.

41:20.141 --> 41:21.708
I feel like this is now
a competition

41:21.742 --> 41:23.042
that's starting for me.

41:23.077 --> 41:25.845
- Logan, congratulations.
- Thank you.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.981
Unfortunately,
that means, Julian,

41:28.015 --> 41:30.617
you have been eliminated.

41:30.651 --> 41:33.019
Julian, it has been
an absolute pleasure

41:33.053 --> 41:34.421
to have you here with us.

41:34.455 --> 41:35.855
And I got to tell you,

41:35.890 --> 41:37.757
you've done some amazing things
this season.

41:37.792 --> 41:40.326
This is definitely
one of the worst situations

41:40.361 --> 41:41.528
we've been in

41:41.562 --> 41:43.530
in terms of picking
our final three.

41:43.564 --> 41:45.098
You guys all killed
this challenge,

41:45.132 --> 41:47.133
and I'm proud
of all four of you.

41:47.168 --> 41:48.802
- Thank you.
- Julian, it's been

41:48.836 --> 41:50.370
great having you here with us.

41:50.404 --> 41:51.938
If you would please head back
to the makeup room

41:51.972 --> 41:54.107
and pack up your kit.

41:54.141 --> 41:55.575
Thank you.

41:55.609 --> 41:58.411
- See you.
- See you, guys.

41:58.446 --> 42:00.713
- Thank you, Julian.
- Good luck.

42:00.748 --> 42:04.117
It stings a bit that I've been
through every single challenge,

42:04.151 --> 42:09.322
did some cool makeups and did
not make it to the finale.

42:09.356 --> 42:12.559
But this whole competition
has really put everything I have

42:12.593 --> 42:13.660
to the test.

42:13.694 --> 42:15.061
I hope that I made my family,

42:15.095 --> 42:16.329
my girlfriend proud,

42:16.363 --> 42:19.432
because I'm proud of myself.

42:22.903 --> 42:25.972
Congrats again to you three.

42:26.006 --> 42:28.007
I'm excited to be able
to call you finalists.

42:28.042 --> 42:29.776
- [all laugh]
- Nice work.

42:29.810 --> 42:31.077
Oh, my gosh.

42:31.111 --> 42:34.380
But your night isn't over yet.

42:34.415 --> 42:36.316
This season's finale
is going to be

42:36.350 --> 42:39.719
- the most difficult one yet.
- Oh, no.

42:39.753 --> 42:42.789
You guys have these amazing
champions in your corner.

42:42.823 --> 42:44.023
So we're raising the bar on you.

42:44.058 --> 42:45.024
Aye, aye, aye.

42:45.059 --> 42:46.159
What bar are we raising?

42:46.193 --> 42:47.560
Oh, no.

42:47.595 --> 42:49.829
I don't feel like I'm ready
to start the finale.

42:49.864 --> 42:51.898
We just went
through hell and back.

42:51.932 --> 42:53.399
What are we doing?

42:53.434 --> 42:55.602
Why are we still on stage?
