00:16.933 --> 00:19.102
What did
the Human Rights Commission say?

00:19.394 --> 00:21.688
They're dragging out the case.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.982
It's been too long, Valdovinos.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.818
Nobody's seen my compadre in months,

00:26.901 --> 00:28.194
he's completely isolated.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.157
I'm sure he's trying
to get in touch with us.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.250
Head down.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.028
CONTROL CENTER

02:16.427 --> 02:17.804
What's that asshole staring at?

02:30.483 --> 02:34.279
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

02:34.696 --> 02:38.700
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

02:38.908 --> 02:43.037
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

02:43.246 --> 02:48.877
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

02:50.253 --> 02:53.256
Even when the clouds drift away

02:54.632 --> 02:57.886
Even when my skin dries away

02:58.636 --> 03:02.265
I'll be back someday

03:03.349 --> 03:07.145
To unleash my return

03:11.941 --> 03:15.737
I have the dust
that protects the road

03:16.321 --> 03:20.199
I have the branches
of a leafless tree

03:20.742 --> 03:24.662
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:25.204 --> 03:30.501
There are silhouettes
that come to meet me

03:31.711 --> 03:34.756
Even when the clouds drift away

03:36.007 --> 03:39.302
Even when my skin dries away

03:40.011 --> 03:43.598
I'll be back someday

03:44.849 --> 03:48.686
To unleash my return

04:19.050 --> 04:20.969
-Permission to speak, sir.
-Quiet.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.224
What do you call
two Mexicans playing basketball?

04:26.307 --> 04:27.433
Quiet!

04:44.325 --> 04:45.326
Dinner time!

05:35.835 --> 05:37.045
Moving.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.214
Come on, move it.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.903
What do you call
two Mexicans playing basketball?

06:02.445 --> 06:03.321
Quiet.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.585
Don't call him by his name.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.378
Use his number.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.465
And only when absolutely necessary.

06:23.257 --> 06:24.926
Don't let him talk to you,

06:25.426 --> 06:27.970
and don't exchange any sort
of information with him.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.521
Dinner.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.151
You the new guy?

06:44.445 --> 06:46.030
PRISON SECURITY

07:10.430 --> 07:11.431
Dinner.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.549
Move.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.218
What do you call
two Mexicans playing basketball?

07:50.219 --> 07:51.095
What?

07:51.179 --> 07:52.054
It's a joke.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.640
What do you call
two Mexicans playing basketball?

07:59.896 --> 08:01.272
Juan on Juan.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.108
Walk.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.409
MEXICO CITY

08:18.789 --> 08:22.710
I MISS YOU TOO
BUT I CAN'T SEE YOU THESE DAYS.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.925
HAS BERTA SAID ANYTHING ABOUT US?

08:29.008 --> 08:31.093
SHE HASN'T. IT'S BEEN
A ROUGH COUPLE DAYS.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.011
GOTTA GO.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.977
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE CHIP.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.733
They're here.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.208
Diana.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.293
Beautiful, as always.

09:05.044 --> 09:05.920
Hello, Conrado.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.549
I was admiring your Melendez.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.177
Isn't it intriguing? Just like you, honey.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.266
Maybe we'll find
a matching piece at the auction.

09:20.059 --> 09:20.935
For sure.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.062
Shall we?

09:23.479 --> 09:24.355
Let's go.

09:27.483 --> 09:30.361
TWO DAYS LATER

10:13.863 --> 10:15.156
My mother's religious as well.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.241
Don't look at me.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.494
They'll know I'm talking to you.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.500
When I saw that rosary of yours,

10:26.792 --> 10:27.793
I thought of my mom.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.964
She must be worried
since she's heard no news of me.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.831
You visit your mom often?

11:09.251 --> 11:10.127
Does she live far away?

11:11.253 --> 11:12.129
She died.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.215
Sorry about that.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.551
One's mother and children
are the greatest things.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.347
Can I ask your name?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.392
No. Move, please.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.033
Can I have a pen?

11:44.245 --> 11:46.288
I'll write a prayer for your mom.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.165
Leave it on the tray.

13:16.253 --> 13:19.131
It's a prayer my mom
says for my dead father.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.014
Thanks.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.390
You're welcome.

13:37.983 --> 13:38.859
Tobias.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.115
There have been
protests in some states

13:45.199 --> 13:47.409
calling for a response
from the Government regarding...

13:47.493 --> 13:48.911
...requesting clarification

13:49.119 --> 13:50.746
about the students' whereabouts...

13:50.829 --> 13:52.206
Demanding their safe return.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.251
Today they've taken
the city of Chilpancingo...

13:55.334 --> 14:00.256
They've been missing
since September 26th...

14:31.161 --> 14:33.747
PROTESTERS MARCH
FOR AYOTZINAPA STUDENT'S ATTACK

14:36.709 --> 14:37.960
You must make a statement.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.923
No, let's wait for things to settle down.

14:43.841 --> 14:48.888
Sir, 43 students vanished
in a very suspicious manner.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.725
Not making a statement is a poor choice.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.187
That will just fuel public outrage.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.565
No.

15:00.774 --> 15:01.942
I know how to handle this.

15:02.026 --> 15:05.571
Anything I say right now
will later be used against me.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.282
Thank you for your concern, Conrado.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.912
I will not intervene. It's for the best.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.589
What information
do you need from outside?

15:25.215 --> 15:26.091
Anything.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.718
Every day's the same in here.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.637
Well, currently...

15:30.346 --> 15:32.765
Ayotzinapa is all over the news.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.101
A bunch of students are missing.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.479
Some say the police took them.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.690
One's been found dead, but...

15:42.316 --> 15:43.984
no news about the others.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.819
There are protests everywhere.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.072
The President won't talk.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.658
They're protesting against him.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.368
The government and the people

15:52.451 --> 15:53.661
are not on good terms.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.374
Everyone says the President is useless.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.502
That's bad news for me.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.587
He'll wash his hands of the matter.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.090
He'll use me to improve his public image.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.508
He'll try to extradite me.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.301
He'll send me overseas...

16:10.636 --> 16:13.514
And I won't even get
to say good-bye to my family.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.850
I really miss them.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.396
Just like you miss your mom.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.523
I don't want them to send me away

16:22.773 --> 16:24.775
before I even get to send them a message.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.486
A message, at least.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.739
But no can do.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.458
What message do you want
to send to your family?

16:52.720 --> 16:54.304
Pineapple juice, please.

17:03.981 --> 17:07.067
Mr. Joaquin asked me
to send all of his love

17:07.151 --> 17:09.028
to his mother, wife, and twins.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.531
He also said you'd give me a "Lora."

17:14.116 --> 17:16.577
That's a real message from my compadre.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.538
No guard would know about Lora.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.874
What does "give him a Lora" mean?

17:24.126 --> 17:27.880
It means this Tobias will be
our connection to Joaquin.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.577
Did you like the watch?

18:00.829 --> 18:01.705
A lot.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.374
Thank you so much, Mr. Joaquin.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.001
No need to thank me, Tobias.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.545
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

18:09.546 --> 18:10.422
Deal?

18:17.596 --> 18:20.182
MEXICO CITY

18:21.850 --> 18:24.394
Miguel, your recovery
is going really well.

18:26.230 --> 18:31.360
You must understand that this
isn't about an illness.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.863
It's a habit that bends people's wills.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.824
For me, my parents were a great help.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.200
That'd be all from me.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.078
Thank you.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.566
101 ATENOR SALAS, NARVARTE.
2 HOURS FROM NOW.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.525
OK.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.584
If your wife hasn't said
or done anything yet,

19:29.376 --> 19:31.086
she must be on our side, right?

19:34.715 --> 19:36.049
We should use that.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.219
Use it for what?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.305
A short vacation.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.310
Short enough we can be together
without having to hide.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.521
Right now, I can't.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.441
I'm the Secretary of State.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.236
It's not that easy to go unnoticed.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.779
I can't take any risks.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.324
Is this good enough for you?

20:01.909 --> 20:03.702
It's not what I want,
but it's better than nothing.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.915
And it's only temporary.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.708
Temporary...

20:11.168 --> 20:12.878
It will be even harder
once you become President.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.592
CALL FROM BERTA

20:23.138 --> 20:24.223
Hi, what is it?

20:37.361 --> 20:38.445
He's an idiot.

20:41.073 --> 20:41.907
Watch.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.580
In May of 2013, Hey
published an article including

20:48.664 --> 20:49.998
photographs of "La Paloma",

20:50.207 --> 20:53.293
First Lady of our nation,
in a luxurious and modern home

20:53.377 --> 20:56.255
in one of Mexico City's
most exclusive neighborhoods.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.091
After a few months of research,
it was found that this house

20:59.174 --> 21:01.343
is not under her name,
nor the President's.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.012
The property's estimated value
is 7 million dollars,

21:04.096 --> 21:06.473
and it's registered
under GIDA Construction Group.

21:06.556 --> 21:10.143
This same group won the tender
for the Mexico Krevle project,

21:10.227 --> 21:13.355
obtaining a revenue
of $8,800,000,000 pesos

21:13.438 --> 21:15.774
during the President's
State Governor period.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.735
This group also hired aircrafts

21:18.819 --> 21:20.779
to support his presidential candidacy.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.157
Only an idiot would think
this would go unnoticed.

21:24.908 --> 21:25.993
His public image is in shreds,

21:26.076 --> 21:28.537
especially since he refused
to talk about Ayotzinapa.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.251
He's going to hit rock bottom with this.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.545
If his image keeps taking these hits,

21:36.753 --> 21:39.589
people will be sick of him
by the next election,

21:39.798 --> 21:40.924
and of us as well.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.427
He'd better respond this time,
and quickly.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.767
I hope you're calling to help,
not to judge me.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.228
I'm calling
to tell you what you have to do

21:53.312 --> 21:55.188
if you want to make it out of this one.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.858
First, cancel the bid
that GIDA Group won,

21:57.941 --> 21:58.942
and reopen the bid.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.485
I'm working on it.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.113
And you must come out
and refute these accusations.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.407
I guess you just learned
that being silent

22:05.490 --> 22:06.658
only makes things worse.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.994
I'll check my options. Thanks for calling.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.463
This asshole really believes
he's President.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.132
He'll ruin our future plans.

22:22.549 --> 22:25.260
One more hit, and he won't stand back up.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.569
Find out
who's controlling these cameras.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.446
What for?

22:45.572 --> 22:46.865
To avoid extradition.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.993
The longer I'm here,

22:50.077 --> 22:51.953
the likelier it is for them to take me.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.665
You want to escape?

22:57.334 --> 22:59.211
Get me their names,
and I'll take care of the rest.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.007
I'm sorry, sir,

23:04.382 --> 23:06.093
but I can't help you with that.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.309
You already helped me once, Tobias,

23:16.228 --> 23:17.562
you don't have a choice now.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.175
Are you going to get me those names,
or not?

23:48.593 --> 23:50.887
They're DICE officers, Mr. Joaquin.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.515
I could get in trouble.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.767
You're already in trouble.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.563
You agreed to give my lawyer a message,

23:59.646 --> 24:01.106
and you accepted a gold watch.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.485
I know how to treat my friends right.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.656
And I think of you as my friend, Tobias.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.241
If you help me,

24:12.242 --> 24:13.535
you'll get the life
you always dreamed of.

24:13.952 --> 24:14.828
If you don't,

24:18.123 --> 24:19.499
your life's about to get way harder.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.732
Fuck!

24:45.275 --> 24:47.611
Can you please take me to the bus stop?

24:55.327 --> 24:56.369
Thanks a lot.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.925
MEXICO CITY

25:11.843 --> 25:12.719
Ready?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.805
I don't get it, why can't it be you?

25:16.473 --> 25:18.975
According to my advisors,
people are fonder of you.

25:19.559 --> 25:20.560
They'll believe you, not me.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.438
Are we ready?

25:25.649 --> 25:26.650
You're a jerk.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.823
Five, four, three, two...

25:35.242 --> 25:36.117
Good morning.

25:36.868 --> 25:40.497
I chose to speak to you
because you deserve the truth.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.457
And I have nothing to hide.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.086
I have worked hard for many years,

25:47.087 --> 25:50.340
and I possess the funds
to buy properties.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.135
I have acquired my estate
thanks to my work,

25:54.594 --> 25:57.639
work I have done for over 25 years.

26:00.892 --> 26:03.353
Up until now, I have paid only 30%,

26:03.979 --> 26:08.066
this is why the property is
still under GIDA Group's name.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.820
It will become mine only
after I pay 100% of its value.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.617
Senator, they're ready for you.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.081
...because I will not allow
any further slandering

26:23.164 --> 26:25.041
about me or my family.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.347
This is a lot worse
than silence.

26:39.889 --> 26:42.559
I told him to face it,
not to send his woman.

26:42.809 --> 26:45.145
Now they'll not only call him
useless and corrupt,

26:45.228 --> 26:46.354
but a coward as well.

26:47.063 --> 26:49.316
We're losing
our grip on the matter.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.443
He was supposed to be PTI's new image,

26:51.526 --> 26:53.069
but he's ruining us.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.613
Put a leash on him, Conrado.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.115
Your future is at stake.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.492
-If he keeps this up...
-Sir, I know.

26:59.617 --> 27:02.329
One more blow and there'll be
no getting back his image.

27:03.621 --> 27:05.123
Not for him, nor for you.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.154
It seemed strange to us
that prisoner Tobias Sanchez

27:36.237 --> 27:37.781
asked so many questions.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.075
When we checked the recordings,

27:40.158 --> 27:41.868
we realized there's a blind spot

27:41.951 --> 27:44.537
between the two cameras on J hall.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.706
They're there right this moment.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.971
Got the names?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.016
I got two officers' names.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.477
I'm missing three from the day shift

28:07.560 --> 28:08.937
and two from the night shift.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.481
There's a delay between cameras

28:11.564 --> 28:13.691
when he's with this particular prisoner.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.194
But that's not all.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.571
We found out some other things.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.912
Take a look yourself, Warden.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.664
Something shady is going on

28:27.747 --> 28:30.375
between this guard and prisoner 3578.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.217
Thank you, officer.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.101
Door.

29:04.617 --> 29:05.869
Sanchez, come with me.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.621
My shift's not over, sir.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.001
Come with me.

29:19.507 --> 29:20.383
Stand up.

29:21.718 --> 29:22.844
I'm not done yet.

29:22.927 --> 29:25.346
Yes you are, Chapo.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.850
Starting today, all meals
will be in your cell.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.603
That's against my rights, warden.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.689
You broke the rules, not me.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.734
Your friend, Tobias, has been discharged.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.069
And the two DICE officers
that gave him their names

29:40.153 --> 29:41.488
have been transferred.

29:42.572 --> 29:46.493
Starting today there'll be
two guards watching you 24/7.

29:47.660 --> 29:51.289
You'll only get out of here
dead, or extradited.

29:52.832 --> 29:53.750
Take him.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.168
Hands on your back.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.816
It's under control,
I just wanted to let you know

30:59.899 --> 31:00.900
as soon as possible, sir.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.777
What measures did you take?

31:03.444 --> 31:04.988
We doubled surveillance,

31:05.071 --> 31:06.781
there's nothing to worry about, sir.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.287
It's impossible for Chapo to escape.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.420
Listen well, Martin.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.550
CONTROL CENTER

31:27.802 --> 31:29.262
Turn the monitors off.

31:29.345 --> 31:30.221
Sir?

31:30.305 --> 31:32.056
Turn them off and stop recording.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.349
Orders from above.

31:53.077 --> 31:53.953
What's going on?

31:55.496 --> 31:56.497
What's going on?

32:01.419 --> 32:03.046
Where are you taking me?

32:03.171 --> 32:04.547
Where are you taking me?

32:05.632 --> 32:06.799
Where are you taking me?

32:09.344 --> 32:10.720
You can't extradite me.

32:10.803 --> 32:12.597
I've got the right to see my lawyers.

32:47.507 --> 32:49.175
Are you still trying to escape?

32:52.512 --> 32:53.721
You gonna extradite me?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.349
No, quite the opposite.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.519
I'll help you escape.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.606
But it can't be just any prison break.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.359
You're going to use a tunnel.

33:08.903 --> 33:09.904
I will grant you access

33:09.988 --> 33:11.614
to the prison's drawings myself.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.118
What are you playing at, Conrado?

33:17.120 --> 33:18.955
Your president's already screwed.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.292
If I escape, the image
of the Administration crumbles.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.129
That's not good for you.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.256
You'll get the drawings

33:29.799 --> 33:31.259
and you will have the support

33:31.342 --> 33:34.387
of any office you need
so that your escape may succeed.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.100
Just make sure this escape
stirs up quite an outrage.

33:40.601 --> 33:42.061
Leave the authorities to me.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.734
Are you gonna catch me?

33:49.527 --> 33:50.695
You'll help me escape

33:50.778 --> 33:52.780
to make a fool out of your president.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.825
And then you'll catch me

33:57.535 --> 33:58.578
and become a hero.

34:00.496 --> 34:02.331
A hero that makes a worthy president.

34:04.292 --> 34:07.795
I will not let his screw-ups
mess up my opportunities.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.134
You'll be the final nail on his coffin,

34:14.677 --> 34:16.471
and once he's buried, it's my chance.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.639
I already told you

34:19.807 --> 34:22.018
the one who should be in prison is you.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.980
I won't stop until I catch you, Joaquin.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.525
But it won't be quick.

34:30.526 --> 34:31.819
The outrage caused by your escape

34:31.903 --> 34:34.489
should be enough to put
the President six feet under.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.242
After that, I'll become
your most relentless chaser.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.245
I know you.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.122
I understand you.

34:45.249 --> 34:47.085
You don't stand a chance against me.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.922
If your presidency depends
on catching me,

34:53.049 --> 34:55.259
you'll never reach the top, Conrado.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.305
Once I'm out,

35:00.431 --> 35:01.724
you'll never find me.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.271
We will see.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.045
Did you take care of the cameras?

35:31.546 --> 35:32.463
Yes, sir.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.507
No one will know you were here.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.884
This will be out secret, Martin.

35:38.010 --> 35:38.886
No one,

35:39.095 --> 35:40.805
not even the ones you trust the most,

35:40.888 --> 35:42.056
should know I was here.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.644
I will reward your support greatly.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.438
I will contact you
with further instructions.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.162
Turn them on.

36:57.924 --> 37:00.051
-Hello.
-So great to see you, Joaquin.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.223
Elba sent this.

37:08.142 --> 37:09.685
She'll be here on visiting day.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.648
We've got a lot to do.

37:14.273 --> 37:16.525
First, I need you
to get me a civil engineer.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.197
Come in.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.533
EDUARDO RUBIO
HEAD OF PRISON SECURITY

37:24.617 --> 37:25.826
Hello, Eduardo.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.411
Thank you for coming.

37:27.536 --> 37:28.788
At your service, Secretary.

37:30.122 --> 37:31.082
Don't be so formal.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.919
We know each other well enough
to get to the point.

37:35.836 --> 37:36.921
What do you need?

37:42.051 --> 37:43.970
The drawings of a particular zone

37:44.053 --> 37:45.096
inside the Altiplano Prison.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.184
I want you to hand them
to Chapo's lawyer.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.895
I'm the Head of Security.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.232
If Chapo escapes,
I'll be the prime suspect.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.693
This Administration is falling
to pieces, Eduardo.

38:00.027 --> 38:01.404
We ought to start planning the next one,

38:02.571 --> 38:04.198
in which I will be the protagonist.

38:05.741 --> 38:06.784
Do you understand?

38:10.371 --> 38:11.956
Can you promise I won't be imprisoned?

38:12.623 --> 38:13.582
You have my word.

38:17.211 --> 38:19.839
There will be dirt
on your hands after this,

38:20.631 --> 38:22.675
but, at most, you will lose
your position,

38:23.467 --> 38:26.178
and a few years later,
we will give you a better one.

38:27.513 --> 38:29.682
We've done our part.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.059
The rest is in your hands.

38:50.077 --> 38:52.413
It goes without saying
that this is a secret.

38:53.622 --> 38:54.832
My wife

38:55.875 --> 38:58.002
and the former president
should not know anything.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.465
Today, in another edition of
Building Review,

39:02.548 --> 39:06.594
we will talk to the man
in charge of the impossible.

39:07.094 --> 39:10.181
When I handed in the first
drawings, they called me insane.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.558
Building this bridge

39:12.641 --> 39:14.894
has gone beyond
the boundaries of Architecture.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.964
