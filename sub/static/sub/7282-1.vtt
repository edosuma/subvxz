02:34.560 --> 02:36.437
Anybody else?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.479
Jenny, again.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.190
Isn't it because Mr Rochester is blind?

02:41.920 --> 02:43.069
Yes, Jenny.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.710
I've got an English essay to do
by tomorrow morning.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.190
Right. So the only sound I want to hear
coming through the ceiling

02:51.280 --> 02:54.192
is the sound of sweat
dripping onto textbooks.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.316
- Cello?
- Mmm. No cello.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.275
I thought we agreed
that cello was my interest or hobby.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.828
Well, it already is
your interest or hobby.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.956
So when they ask you
at the Oxford interview,

03:04.040 --> 03:05.473
"What is your interest or hobby?"

03:05.560 --> 03:07.676
you can say the cello
and you won't be lying.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.035
But you don't have to practise a hobby.

03:10.560 --> 03:11.959
A hobby is a hobby.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.156
Can I stop going
to the youth orchestra, then?

03:14.400 --> 03:17.710
No! No, no, the youth orchestra's
a good thing.

03:17.800 --> 03:22.430
- That shows you're a joiner-inner.
- Yes, but I've already joined in.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.552
So now I can stop.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.478
No! No, that just shows the opposite.
Don't you see?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.640
No, that shows you're a rebel.
They don't want that at Oxford.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.950
No. They don't want people
who can think for themselves.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.553
No, of course they don't.

- No, it didn't fall off.

- You kicked it off. Now, come on.
- But my sock's all wet!

05:24.160 --> 05:27.277
Hello. Look, if you had any sense,

05:27.360 --> 05:28.713
you wouldn't take a lift
from a strange man,

05:28.800 --> 05:31.314
but I'm a music lover
and I'm worried about your cello,

05:32.440 --> 05:35.910
so what I propose is you put it
in my car and walk alongside me.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.869
How do I know
you won't just drive off with the cello?

05:42.040 --> 05:44.076
Good point. Um...

05:45.400 --> 05:49.279
How much does a new cello cost?
£10, £15? I don't know.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.669
Let's say 15.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.279
No? All right.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.313

- Right.

- Jenny.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.993
Very good.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.317
- How did the concert go?
- It was a rehearsal.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.834
- The concert's next Thursday.
- What are you playing?

06:32.440 --> 06:34.078
- Elgar.
- Ah!

06:34.560 --> 06:37.552
I think it's a shame he spent
so much time in Worcester, don't you?

06:37.640 --> 06:40.552
Because Worcester's too near Birmingham,
and you can hear that in the music.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.599
There's a terrible Brummy accent
in there, if you listen hard enough.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.711
Anyway, Elgar and the Jews
don't mix very well.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.638
- I'm not a Jew.
- No, I am.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.668
- (LAUGHING) Oh!
- I wasn't accusing you.

- Oh, they're real.
- (LAUGHING) So people say.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.830
- Smoke?
- I'd better not.

I live just up there.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.350
- Why don't we believe in them?
- He'd say there's no point to them.

- Your father, this is?
- Oh, yes.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.912
They're just for fun.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.396
Apart from school concerts, which are
no fun at all, so we go to those.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.590
- They don't help you get on.
- Which, of course,

08:18.680 --> 08:20.398
is what's so wonderful about them.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.038
- Anyway, you'll go one day.
- I know. I will.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.551

- A chap? What kind of chap?
- He's wishing me luck for tonight.

Oh, is that all he's wishing you?
Where'd he get the money from?

11:25.480 --> 11:28.552
- He earns it, I expect.
- Earns it? Why isn't he at school?

will actually be responsible

Of course. Nothing.

Because I'm going to listen to

My friends Danny and Helen would be
coming, too, so it wouldn't be...

I'll tell you what,
I'll come and pick you up,

13:27.520 --> 13:28.748
and if your mother and father
disapprove,

13:28.840 --> 13:30.432

and go with one of them.

- Mmm. If you want to.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.073
Well, if you'd like supper,

13:55.160 --> 13:58.994
then perhaps on Friday
you could not eat?

Yes. Of course.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.870

JENNY: You've heard of supper.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.518
HATTIE: We've heard of it,
but we've never eaten it.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.392

to tell us everything.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.198
HATTIE: Otherwise it's not fair.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.510
- I won't allow it!
- Fine! He's more than happy

14:23.600 --> 14:25.477
- for you to take me.
- Fine, I will.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.359
- Good!
- Well, where is it?

14:27.680 --> 14:29.193
- St John's Smith Square.
- Where's that?

14:29.280 --> 14:30.679
I don't know.
I'm sure we could find out.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.194
It's in Westminster.
Right next door to the Abbey.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.316
- How do you know that?
- I had a life

14:35.400 --> 14:37.789
before we were married, you know.
You soon put a stop to that.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.831
- Well, there you are.
- Where are we?

14:39.920 --> 14:42.673
We're near Westminster Abbey.
I'm not going all the way over there.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.955
The trouble is
that's where St John's Smith Square is.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.395
Well, there must be something on
locally. Where's the paper?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.272
She wants to see someone who can play.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.750
She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland
scratching away. I'll take her.

- Jack!
- Oh, by the way, David's a Jew.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.114
A wandering Jew. So watch yourself.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.478
What does she mean by that?
I've never said anything like that!

15:08.640 --> 15:11.552
It's just an expression.
I've got nothing against the Jews...

15:12.680 --> 15:14.591
Glad to hear it. Hello.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.233
I didn't mean I've got nothing against
you. No, of course I do mean that.

- Dad.
- No. It's... Sorry, it's just that...

15:22.600 --> 15:26.070
You're not the sort of person
that I would be against.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.470
Well, I wouldn't, because I'm not
the kind of person who would be against

15:30.880 --> 15:32.313
people.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.514
I'm Jack. This is my wife, Marjorie.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.992
You didn't tell me
you had a sister, Jenny.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.912
Please.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.558
You're a lucky man, Jack.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.352
Yes, I suppose I am.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.674
- This is lovely.
- Thank you.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.431
Oh, I'm sorry, David.
Would you like a drink?

16:05.920 --> 16:08.480
I'd love one, Jack,
but we're running a little late.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.508
If Jenny's ready,
perhaps we'll shoot off?

16:13.280 --> 16:16.750
Actually, David,
Dad has something he has to tell you.

16:18.320 --> 16:22.871
No, no. Really. Well, it was just
a question, a point of reference.

16:22.960 --> 16:27.431
What's the best way to get
to St John's Smith Square from here?

16:27.600 --> 16:29.716
It's a straight run, really.
Up to Hammersmith,

16:29.880 --> 16:31.677
take the A4 through Kensington,
you're there.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.637
- As simple as that?
- As simple as that.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.080
- Shall I book us some tickets?
- No.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.714
Well, have her back by 10:00, David.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.358
Well, I was hoping
she might come with me afterwards

16:44.440 --> 16:45.998
for a spot of supper with my Aunt Helen.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.199
Oh, well...

16:50.200 --> 16:52.350
(CHUCKLING) No, no, well...

16:52.440 --> 16:53.919
She's usually in bed by then.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.471
What if I promise
to have her back by 11:30?

16:58.960 --> 17:00.951
Well, it's Friday night,

17:01.720 --> 17:03.312
and you are going all the way
to the West End.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.950
Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.839
All right.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.193
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.912
Have a nice time.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.991
Come on.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.110
- DAVID: Hello, hello!
- Ah!

17:30.680 --> 17:31.715
Are we late?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.472
No, I thought
we were going to miss the beginning,

17:33.560 --> 17:34.675
and then it wouldn't be worth going in

17:34.760 --> 17:36.398
and we could all go off dancing
or something.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.879
Helen is one of the more
reluctant members

17:37.960 --> 17:39.712
- of tonight's audience.
- Hello.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.031
Jenny, these are my friends,
Helen and Danny. Shall we?

17:43.280 --> 17:45.510
- JENNY: Hello.
- All right?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.630
DANNY: Four, please.
USHER: Thank you, sir.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.833
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.990
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.194
- Where did you get it from?
- Oh, I don't know. Chelsea somewhere.

18:03.120 --> 18:07.238
Oh, yours is... Well, good
for this sort of concert, isn't it?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.353
Thank you.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.549
We should go shopping together one day,
you and I, if you want.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.153
That would be nice.

18:14.840 --> 18:18.196
But Chelsea,
c'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.839
Sorry?

18:21.200 --> 18:23.873
I just said,
"It's too expensive for me. "

18:24.840 --> 18:26.990
No, you didn't.
You said something completely different.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.559
No, well...

18:29.000 --> 18:31.434
- I said it in French.
- In French? Why?

18:33.040 --> 18:34.519
I don't know.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.155
Well, Chelsea's too expensive
for me, too, really,

18:38.240 --> 18:40.310
but we don't have to worry about that.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.312
If you want something in Chelsea,
just get David to take you shopping.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.110
Why would David want
to take me shopping?

18:49.000 --> 18:52.151
(ORCHESTRA PLAYING
INTRODUCTION ET ALLEGRO)

19:35.960 --> 19:38.349
I booked a table at Juliette's.
Will that kill the mood, do you think?

19:38.440 --> 19:42.672
Oh, I hope so! God, I always think
I'm going to my own funeral

19:42.760 --> 19:45.115
when I listen to classical music.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.552
- That was classical, wasn't it?
- Yes. Very classical.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.636
- As classical as you can get.
- Juliette's it is, then.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.190
Heaven forbid we should end the evening
reflecting on our own mortality.

# A love to last past Saturday night #

20:13.600 --> 20:17.229
DANNY:... Miles Davis, Sartre...

20:17.320 --> 20:20.471
Extraordinary woman, Gréco.
Just like you, Helen.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.558
What about Chante Françoise Sagan?
Have you heard that one?

20:25.640 --> 20:27.312
- It's wonderful.
- I've only got...

20:27.400 --> 20:29.994
I think it's just called Juliette Gréco.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.355
The one with the eyes on the sleeve?
I saved up

20:32.440 --> 20:35.034
and got my French Conversation teacher
to bring it back after Christmas.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.680
- You have a French Conversation teacher?
- Yes.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.228
Is that why you suddenly speak French
for no reason?

20:41.720 --> 20:44.109
DANNY: Have you never heard her sing?
She's marvellous.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.958
You should see her in Paris,
though, not here.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.112
David will take you.

20:49.360 --> 20:53.069
- I'd love to. You'd fit right in.
- Better than here, really.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.196
Isn't it wonderful
to find a young person

20:55.280 --> 20:58.192
who wants to know things?
There's so much I want you to see.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.029
Are you all right
to come and have a look

21:05.120 --> 21:07.190
at that Pembroke Villas place with me
on Friday, Danny?

21:07.480 --> 21:11.189
Oh, no, I can't. There's a Burne-Jones
coming up at Christie's on Friday.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.679
Desperate to get my hands on it.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.398
You're thinking of buying a Burne-Jones?

21:14.480 --> 21:16.277
- Mmm.
- A real one?

21:17.080 --> 21:19.150
I just have a feeling the
Pre-Raphaelites are going to take off.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.958
I love the Pre-Raphaelites!

21:21.160 --> 21:23.071
- DAVID: Do you?
- Yes, of course!

21:23.320 --> 21:25.470
Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway.
Not Holman Hunt so much,

21:25.560 --> 21:27.551
- he's so garish.
- Oh, absolutely.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.872
Well, why don't we all go
to the auction together?

21:30.960 --> 21:34.430
- Auction! Gosh, how exciting.
- It's Friday morning.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.671
Friday. Oh.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.995
- You're busy?
- Well, yes.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.639
Tant pis.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.030

- No. I'm sure I could rearrange.

That would be lovely.

- We finished tea at 7:00.
- I know what time it is.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.513
How was your evening?

23:25.760 --> 23:27.637
Best night of my life.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.993
Night, Mum.

23:42.680 --> 23:48.357
I think there were two violins,
one cello, two violas, a harp...

23:48.440 --> 23:49.953
I don't want to hear about Ravel.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.792
I want to know
what else was on the programme.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.315
It was nothing like that.
He was a perfect gentleman.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.595
He just said he wanted to take me places
and show me things.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.035
- "Things"?
- Plural? My God!

23:59.840 --> 24:02.513
(STERNLY) I knew that Jane Eyre
would eventually work its magic on you.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.790
I'm assuming that's what you're all
so animated about.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.552
JENNY: Of course.
TINA: Jane Eyre

24:06.640 --> 24:09.234
- and Jenny's new boyfriend.
- He's not my new boyfriend.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.238
That's true.
He's more of a man friend, actually.

24:11.320 --> 24:14.232
- He's got a sports car, Miss Stubbs!
- It's maroon.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.834
So could we call him
a Mr Rochester figure?

24:16.960 --> 24:19.474
I think he must be as blind
as Mr Rochester.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.236
You may or may not have noticed
I'm trying to steer the subject away

24:22.320 --> 24:24.595
from Jenny's lurid love life
into the matter in hand.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.519
And it is clear from this evidence

24:26.600 --> 24:28.272
that most of you know
far too much about the former

24:28.360 --> 24:29.998
and next to nothing about the latter.

24:30.520 --> 24:33.830
Reluctantly, I have to admit
that Jenny is clearly an expert on both.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.190
Excellent as always, Jenny.

- Hello.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.796
The Tree of Forgiveness
by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.

25:23.920 --> 25:28.755
This is a rare opportunity to purchase a
key work of the Pre-Raphaelite movement.

- Who will start me off at 100 guineas?
- Is it that one?

25:31.880 --> 25:33.438
Yes, that's the one.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.837
Fifty guineas?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.439
Twenty guineas?

25:39.040 --> 25:42.874
Thank you. Forty? Thank you, sir.

Do I hear 60?

25:45.560 --> 25:48.632
Eighty guineas? Thank you, sir.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.676
Another one, madam? One hundred guineas?

25:51.280 --> 25:52.759
One hundred and twenty?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.352
No further bids?

- What?

26:00.480 --> 26:02.072

- Your turn.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.114
- Any more?
- Quick!

26:04.200 --> 26:07.112
One hundred and twenty guineas
from the very eager new bidder.

One hundred and forty, madam?

26:09.320 --> 26:11.959
Thank you.

One hundred and eighty? Thank you.

Two hundred and twenty?

Another one, madam?

26:28.960 --> 26:32.396
Sold for 200 guineas. Thank you.

- Your name, please?
- Mellor.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.155
Now we move on to Lot 42...

26:41.240 --> 26:43.629
Thank you very much. I couldn't possibly
have bought it without you.

26:45.680 --> 26:46.715
DAVID: Just a couple of years ago,

26:46.800 --> 26:49.394
you could pick one of them up
for 50 quid. No one was interested.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.670
JENNY: Oh, I would have been
so interested.

I just love things.

There aren't many people
who come in here and say that.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.309
No, certainly not me.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.198
- Oh, it's beautiful! Do you play?
- Thank you.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.953
I used to. I vowed to myself
that one day I'd own one of these

27:11.040 --> 27:12.792
and now I do own one,
I don't touch the bugger.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.388
It's vulgar, really,
putting it on display.

27:15.480 --> 27:16.913
Give it to Jenny.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.319
- I think that would be even more vulgar.
- DAVID: Play for us, Jenny.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.109
- No, one day, when I'm good enough.
- She's good enough now.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.395
David, you've never seen me play.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.554
I can come and hear you in Oxford,
when you get there.

27:29.720 --> 27:31.392
We should all go
and spend a weekend in Oxford.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.553
Straw boaters, punting, cream teas...

27:34.640 --> 27:36.756
- Boats.
- ... antiquarian book shops.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.833
Bit of business, if we can find it.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.831
- What about next weekend?
- HELEN: Mmm!

27:41.920 --> 27:43.319
Yes.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.119
I wouldn't be allowed to do that.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.233
- I'll talk to them.
- You're going to ask my father

27:51.320 --> 27:53.356
if you can take me away for the weekend?

27:53.440 --> 27:55.670
- He'd have you arrested.
- We'll see.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.918
- I bet you can't.
- How much?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.356
I'd be careful if I were you, Jenny.
You don't know who you're dealing with.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.119
Half a crown.

You're on.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.233
How do you know Danny?

28:10.320 --> 28:14.313
Oh, you know.
We kept bumping into each other,

28:14.400 --> 28:16.072
then we became pals,

28:17.040 --> 28:19.554
and we've ended up doing a bit
of business together when it suits us.

28:19.640 --> 28:23.155
- What kind of business?
- Property, a bit of art dealing.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.679
Some buying and selling. This and that.

Go on, then.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.552
Sorry about that.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.750
How do you know those negro people?

29:49.840 --> 29:52.070
- They're clients.
- Clients?

29:53.560 --> 29:55.391
Schvartzers have to live somewhere.

29:55.480 --> 29:58.119
It's not as if they can rent
off their own kind, is it?

30:04.120 --> 30:08.989
Test results for the Virgil translation.
We'll start from the bottom.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.232
Patricia.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.879
Absent.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.795
Margaret, 48%.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.479
Jenny!

30:20.360 --> 30:23.272
(CLICKS TONGUE) Fifty-two percent.

30:23.920 --> 30:27.879
That would just about scrape a pass
in the exam proper.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.838
Not good enough for Oxford candidates.

30:36.320 --> 30:40.154
- It's her Latin, isn't it?
- Everyone's doing their best, Jack.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.276
But what if everyone's best isn't good
enough? What do we do then? Hmm?

30:45.720 --> 30:47.631
Well, perhaps the whole thing's
been a waste of money, anyway.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.711
- You don't mean that.
- Well, what's she going to do

30:49.800 --> 30:51.279
with an English degree?

30:51.360 --> 30:54.079
If she's going to spend three years
playing that bloody cello,

30:54.160 --> 30:56.435
talking in French
to a bunch of beatniks,

30:56.520 --> 30:59.432
well, I'm just throwing
good money after bad.

30:59.520 --> 31:00.999
Well, she might meet
a nice lawyer there,

31:01.080 --> 31:03.355
but she could do that
at a dinner dance tomorrow!

31:03.440 --> 31:06.432
Oh, because that's the point
of an Oxford education, isn't it, Dad?

31:06.520 --> 31:08.875
It's the expensive alternative
to a dinner dance.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.078
What about private tuition?

31:12.400 --> 31:15.437
Can anybody hear me?
How much is this going to cost me?

31:15.520 --> 31:17.954
Five shillings an hour,
maybe a little more for A-level.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.873
Five bob? We spend five bob here,
we spend five bob there.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.552
Next thing you know,
that's our savings down the drain.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.278
And what else
are we spending five bob on?

31:24.360 --> 31:25.998
What else are we spending sixpence on?

31:26.120 --> 31:30.159
Oh, nothing! No! Nothing.
All of this is free. This vase is free.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.151
It was, actually.
It was a present from Auntie Vi.

31:32.240 --> 31:36.028
That chair, this sofa, it's all free.
We didn't have to pay for any of it.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.554
You see,
that's the beauty of life, Jenny.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.312
You don't have to pay for anything.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.278
You know, there's a lovely Oxford tree
growing in the garden.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.749
Lucky for you,
because that's Oxford taken care of.

31:45.880 --> 31:49.395
And there's a whole orchard
of school trees, so that school is free,

31:49.560 --> 31:51.949
and I think there's even
a private tuition tree in there.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.792
- I'll just go and check, shall I?
- Jack!

31:53.880 --> 31:55.950
Oh, it's all right, Marjorie.
Don't worry, I'll only be a second,

31:56.040 --> 31:59.669
because I think there's a whole clump of
them surrounding the pocket money tree!

31:59.840 --> 32:02.035
I'll just go and make sure
they're all nice and safe, shall I?

32:02.120 --> 32:03.439
Oh, and by the way, you might be lucky.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.239
There might be a man with deep pockets
growing out there,

32:06.320 --> 32:08.151
because God knows
you're going to need one!

32:12.240 --> 32:13.673
(DOOR SLAMS)

32:14.880 --> 32:17.269
Well, you can always go
to secretarial college with Hattie.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.430
- Oh, thanks.
- HATTIE: Charming!

32:21.080 --> 32:23.355
- (SOFTLY) Oh, God. No.
- (EAGERLY) Hello!

32:24.240 --> 32:26.151
(SIGHING) Hello, Graham.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.879
I haven't seen you in ages.

32:33.400 --> 32:36.631
It went a bit wrong, didn't it?
The tea party, I mean.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.069
Was it because of the year off thing?
Because I...

32:44.160 --> 32:45.593
No!

32:46.560 --> 32:50.838
I just have so much work to do
if I'm going to get the grades I need.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.880
Yeah, she doesn't have time for boys.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.193
- Bye, Graham!
- Bye.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.633
(CLEARS THROAT SELF-CONSCIOUSLY)

33:14.000 --> 33:16.116
DAVID: (IN SILLY VOICE) And I'll tell you
what the first thing

33:16.200 --> 33:18.475
my grandfather did when he retired...

33:18.560 --> 33:20.118
(JACK AND MARJORIE LAUGHING)

33:21.720 --> 33:26.271
...was to say to my grandmother
when she expired.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.151
- You do all the Goons?
- No, my Eccles is no good.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.549
- Oh, no, you've got him.
- No, no.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.989
- DAVID: (IN SILLY VOICE) I can't do it...
- Hello.

33:36.840 --> 33:41.231
Ah, Jenny. David does
the most fantastic Bluebottle.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.517
- You came to see my parents?
- JACK: Why is that so hard to imagine?

33:44.960 --> 33:47.872
Why are you drinking?
It's not Christmas.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.476
Well, there's a lot you don't know
about us, young lady.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.959
We had a life before you came along.

33:52.040 --> 33:55.271
Mmm, that's true. I'm only going
on what I've seen for the last 16 years.

33:55.360 --> 33:59.638
I'm trying to think what you missed.
Nothing much comes to mind.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.439
Anyway, I've got a huge pile
of Latin translation to do.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.476
But you didn't tell us
David went to Oxford.

34:09.480 --> 34:13.712
- No! I didn't.
- For all the good it did me.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.155
- Isn't that funny?
- Extraordinary.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.989
I was just telling Jack
that I'm going back next weekend.

34:20.760 --> 34:23.034
I go and visit my old English professor
every now and again.

34:23.159 --> 34:26.789
See, that's what you need, Jenny.
Someone on the inside track.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.710
It's not always what you know,
is it, David?

34:28.800 --> 34:31.553
Too true.
Have you ever come across Clive Lewis?

34:31.840 --> 34:33.637
Dad's never come across anyone.

34:34.040 --> 34:38.351
He wrote a children's book called
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

34:38.440 --> 34:41.591
- that did very well, I believe.
- CS Lewis.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.148
Well, to us he was just the old codger
who taught Medieval Literature,

34:44.239 --> 34:47.437
but I came to know him very well.
We just

34:48.679 --> 34:50.112
got along.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.554
Jenny used to devour those books.

34:53.239 --> 34:55.071
I'd love to meet him.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.150
I'm sorry,
am I being slow on the uptake?

35:03.520 --> 35:05.238
Would Jenny like to come at the weekend?

35:05.320 --> 35:09.074
(STAMMERING) Oh, not this weekend,
but sometime, perhaps. Yes.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.558
How often do you see him?

35:12.480 --> 35:15.199
Not very often. Every couple of years.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.672
Maybe next time.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.912
Well, I suppose...

35:24.000 --> 35:25.399
Would she have to stay the night?

35:26.120 --> 35:29.635
I wouldn't recommend driving home
after one of those Oxford dinners.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.951
Clive could get her a room
at the college. It's easy enough.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.192
Seems like too good an opportunity
to pass up.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.952
It wouldn't be a bother,
would it, David?

35:45.360 --> 35:46.793
(SWEET NOTHIN'S PLAYING LOUDLY)

35:49.160 --> 35:50.149
Come on!

35:50.240 --> 35:52.356
HELEN: Just putting a few things
in a bag! Don't worry!

35:53.240 --> 35:55.879
# Yeah, we both understand

35:56.560 --> 35:59.074
# Ooh, sweet nothin's #
# Ooh, sweet nothin's #

36:01.880 --> 36:03.313
Come on!

36:03.560 --> 36:05.835
We're nearly ready!
Be there in two ticks.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.751
How can they only be nearly ready?

36:10.800 --> 36:12.870
I wouldn't be surprised
if three of them came out of there.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.751
It's the only explanation.
They're making themselves a friend.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.351
Ladies, come on, let's go!

36:19.240 --> 36:21.196
There, have a look in the corner.
Open the door.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.030
You should keep that one,
if you want it.

36:25.440 --> 36:28.318
- One can only wear so many in one day.
- Thank you.

36:29.240 --> 36:32.391
What about tonight?
Have you got a pretty enough nightie?

36:34.200 --> 36:35.599
Won't I be sharing a room with you?

36:36.880 --> 36:38.279
Oh, you haven't slept with him.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.149
- No.
- Good for you.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.557
- Really? Do you think so?
- Yes! Well, you're only 16.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.153
- You don't want to get preggers, do you?
- (QUICKLY) No.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.555
(STAMMERING) No,
I wouldn't let that happen.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.359
I want to wait until I'm 17.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.234
- On my 17th birthday, hopefully.
- With David?

36:55.640 --> 36:57.471
Oh, golly,
it will be with David, won't it?

36:57.600 --> 37:00.751
If that's what you want.
Anyway, I'll find you a nightie.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.713
Ta-da!

37:09.480 --> 37:10.913
DANNY: Mmm!

37:18.200 --> 37:19.474
Shall we make a move?

37:19.560 --> 37:25.908
ALL: # Got me wrapped around
your little finger

37:26.680 --> 37:29.672
# If this is love

37:29.760 --> 37:34.151
# It's everything I hoped it would be #

37:44.480 --> 37:45.879
JENNY: Can't we get out
and have a look around?

37:46.280 --> 37:48.669
Later, if we have time.

37:48.760 --> 37:52.150
- Imagine spending three years here.
- (SHUDDERS) I know.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.871
(TEEN SCENE PLAYING IN BACKGROUND)

37:59.480 --> 38:01.994
HELEN: Why are university girls
so strange-looking?

38:02.160 --> 38:04.549
They can't all have started off
that way, can they?

38:04.640 --> 38:07.916
I mean, most girls aren't born ugly,
but most girl students seem to be,

38:08.000 --> 38:09.558
so there must be something
about these places

38:09.640 --> 38:12.837
that make you fat or spotty
or short-sighted.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.718
Well, when you look at it like that,

38:14.800 --> 38:18.156
I mean, that's proper scientific
analysis. You can't argue with science.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.230
I still don't quite understand
what you want to do when you get here.

38:22.320 --> 38:23.719
I want to read English.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.798
- Books.
- Sorry?

38:27.160 --> 38:28.991
You want to read English books.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.353
"Reading English"
is just another way of saying...

38:32.440 --> 38:34.908
Don't worry, Jenny.
You're wasting your breath.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.434
Anyway, tomorrow
we'll get more of a feel for the place.

38:37.680 --> 38:41.150
Absolutely. This place will be good
for a little business.

38:41.480 --> 38:43.118
All those little old ladies
wandering around.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.191
- Old ladies?
- This place is rife with stats.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.920
Please explain what stats are.
You're always going on about them.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.479
Oh...

38:49.560 --> 38:52.028
- It isn't very interesting.
- But you two are interested.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.951
That's because
we're not very interesting, either.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.712
- Oh, no, they're not, really.
- DANNY: It's true.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.314
That's why we need you here.
To save us from ourselves.

38:58.400 --> 39:01.551
Yeah, to put some intelligence
and culture into our brutal lives.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.438
- Sing to us! Sing to us!
- Please don't make me sing for you.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.317
Please don't make us talk about work.

39:10.320 --> 39:15.235
So, now, is he Clive, do you think,
or CS?

39:15.320 --> 39:16.958
I'm confused now.
I thought you made him up.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.439
No, we...

39:19.720 --> 39:21.153
Never mind.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.112
"To dear Jenny,
with the pleasure of meeting you.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.994
"Come and see me again soon, Clive. "

39:29.400 --> 39:30.799
Dirty old man.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.792
- No?
- Mmm-hmm.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.556
We've got these exact same curtains
at home.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.830
Let's not talk about curtains.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.348
You look beautiful.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.071
- David.
- Mmm?

40:00.400 --> 40:02.118
There's something you should know.

40:06.280 --> 40:07.759
I'm a virgin,

40:08.360 --> 40:11.158
and I want to stay that way
until I'm 17.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.358
I think that's good.
I think that's right.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.073
We can still be romantic, though,
can't we?

40:28.920 --> 40:33.072
Yes, of course.
As long as it's not actually...

40:33.760 --> 40:35.193
Minnie.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.759
Is that me?

40:39.400 --> 40:42.472
Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse

40:44.480 --> 40:47.358
and I'm your bubbalub.

40:50.160 --> 40:53.232
Okay. If that's what you want to do.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.713
- Minnie.
- Yes, David?

40:58.160 --> 40:59.593
Bubbalub.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.673
Bubbalub.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.633
May I have a look?

41:13.600 --> 41:14.999
Just a peek.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.558
You just want to see them?

41:57.040 --> 41:58.439
(WHISPERING) Thank you.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.477
I think there's a house for sale
around here.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.073
Really?

42:23.360 --> 42:25.430
- DAVID: Might be worth a look.
- Mmm-hmm.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.033
Right.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.433
- Do you want...
- No.

42:34.440 --> 42:37.159
- Jenny!
- Aren't you coming?

42:37.240 --> 42:40.118
- We don't go in.
- (LAUGHING) What are you talking about?

42:40.360 --> 42:42.078
Why don't you go and get
a nice cup of tea somewhere?

42:42.960 --> 42:44.075
Helen will look after you.

42:44.160 --> 42:46.594
I don't need looking after,
thank you very much. David...

42:46.680 --> 42:48.636
I'm not going to tell you a second time.

42:49.120 --> 42:50.599
Run along.

42:59.200 --> 43:02.749
- Well, they won't be long, either way.
- Either way?

43:02.840 --> 43:05.991
Well, sometimes they find something
and sometimes they don't.

43:06.080 --> 43:09.436
And when they do find something,
we often have to leave quite quickly.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.668
They can be quite naughty sometimes.

43:13.560 --> 43:14.675
DAVID: Thank you!
WOMAN: Bye!

43:14.760 --> 43:17.513
DANNY: Cheerio!
HELEN: Catch! Careful. Careful.

43:19.320 --> 43:20.719
Come on.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.193
- Helen!

I'm telling you to go to Oxford,

Because if you don't,
you'll break my heart.

- Where did you go?
- Cambridge.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.232

- Jenny, are you taking precautions?
- It's nothing to do with that.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.871
- Isn't it?
- Maybe all our lives are going to end up

And you're aware, I suppose,
that our Lord was Jewish?

There's no life in it, or colour
or fun. It's probably just as well

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.471
the Russians are going to drop
a nuclear bomb on us any day now.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.553
So my choice is
to do something hard and boring,

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.359
or to marry my Jew

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.956
and go to Paris and Rome
and listen to jazz

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:57.749
and read and eat good food
in nice restaurants and have fun.

It's not enough to educate us
any more, Mrs Walters.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.477

why you're doing it.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.274

you know. There's the Civil Service.

I don't wish to be impertinent,
Mrs Walters,

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.555

to know the point of it all one day.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.716
Of course. But it doesn't have to be
books now, does it?

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.389
I'm sorry I said those silly things.
I didn't understand.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.511
Let's forget about it.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:43.679
- A Burne-Jones.
- Do you like him?

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.955
I do. Still.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:51.510
"Still"? You sound very old and wise.

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.837
I feel old, but not very wise.

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:04.993
Miss Stubbs, I need your help.

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.759
I was so hoping
that's what you were going to say.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.632
(SIGHS)

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.118
Thank you, Marjorie.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.432
It's from Oxford.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.191
MARJORIE: "It is my pleasure
to inform you

01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:01.991
"that your application to read English
at Oxford has been accepted.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:04.150
"On behalf of the Faculty of Arts,

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:08.153
"the staff of the university
look forward to welcoming you... "

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.920
So I went to read English books,

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.116
and did my best
to avoid the speccy, spotty fate

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.634
that Helen had predicted for me.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:38.430
I probably looked as wide-eyed,
fresh and artless as any other student.

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.713
But I wasn't.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.998
One of the boys I went out with,

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.559
and they really were boys,

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:48.832
once asked me to go to Paris with him.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:53.471
And I told him I'd love to,
I was dying to see Paris,

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.517
as if I'd never been.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:09.837
