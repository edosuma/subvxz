WEBVTT

00:00.292 --> 00:01.960
- Previously on "All Stars..."

00:01.960 --> 00:05.339
For this week's maxi challenge,
we are playing...

00:05.339 --> 00:07.883
The Snatch Game of Love.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.510
[cheers and applause]

00:09.510 --> 00:11.511
- Where's the strangest place
you've ever been naked?

00:11.511 --> 00:12.679
- Brrrr.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.599
- I find you quite annoying
over here, baby.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.309
- [laughs]
- Ha!

00:17.309 --> 00:18.769
- Hello, gorgeous.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.854
- I like a big dick.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.105
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.774
- Can someone come
get this little girl?

00:25.817 --> 00:28.320
- Besides, Gia, who do you think
is going to be in trouble?

00:28.320 --> 00:29.446
- I don't care
what anybody says.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.199
We know who is going home.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.743
- But this might be the chance
to get off another player.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.161
You know what I mean?
Did you think about that?

00:37.162 --> 00:38.747
- No, ma'am.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.957
- The jokes weren't landing

00:39.957 --> 00:42.000
because they weren't relevant
to the question.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.545
- You played her
almost like a ho.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.922
- I have you in a corner,

00:46.922 --> 00:49.591
and I could be like,
you know what?

00:49.591 --> 00:51.551
Let's get rid
of the strongest competition,

00:51.551 --> 00:52.386
and the rest of it
can be a cake walk.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.472
- I can't trust this bitch.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.473
[slurping]

00:56.473 --> 00:58.725
- Manila, you're a winner, baby.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.937
[applause]

01:01.937 --> 01:05.649
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

01:05.649 --> 01:07.317
- Gia.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.445
I love you.
- Gia, sashay away.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.873
- Whew.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.375
Well, that was
Snatch Game, huh?

01:23.375 --> 01:24.418
- Girl.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.877
- Gia just got eliminated,

01:25.877 --> 01:29.089
and America, I'm happy
that the bitch is gone.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.134
She was horrible
in the Snatch Game of Love,

01:32.134 --> 01:34.511
as well as annoying and rude

01:34.511 --> 01:37.514
and picking on
other contestants.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.516
I'm over her drama.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.893
- "Believe in you and only you."
- "And only you."

01:41.893 --> 01:43.645
All right.
- "Gia."

01:43.645 --> 01:44.855
- G-G-G-Gia.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.106
- I wish her the best.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.108
I really think she is
a beautiful woman.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.901
I think she has a lot to offer.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.487
But there needs to be
a little bit more growth.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.032
- I think what it is
is that drag can really help you

01:55.032 --> 01:58.201
like discover how you want to
present yourself to the world.

01:58.201 --> 02:02.122
It's a safe place
to start feeling your fem,

02:02.122 --> 02:04.458
and I think it's just that

02:04.458 --> 02:07.711
she's really concentrating on
her transition at this moment,

02:07.711 --> 02:10.088
and drag is becoming
a job for her.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.549
You know, I love Gia.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.259
She annoyed
the fuck out of me,

02:14.259 --> 02:16.428
but it makes me love her
even more.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.138
Gia, we'll see you
on the other side.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.849
I think Gia is an amazing queen.

02:20.849 --> 02:24.144
And I was so happy to see her
back in this competition

02:24.144 --> 02:25.520
openly female presenting.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.774
I mean, I know it's not
an easy thing to do,

02:28.774 --> 02:30.901
but Gia was stirring the pot

02:30.901 --> 02:32.527
and making all of us
totally crazy.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.446
She had to go the fuck home.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.239
- Girl, you won, sis.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.241
$10.000.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.409
- [applause]
- Congratulations.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.788
- I feel like I won $10.000,

02:42.788 --> 02:44.831
but I don't feel like
I truly won the Snatch Game.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.876
There was no comparison
to the job that you did.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.461
- [applause]
- You made history, bitch.

02:49.461 --> 02:52.130
- But just for the record, on
Wikipedia, I won this episode.

02:52.130 --> 02:55.592
[all laugh]

02:55.592 --> 02:57.260
- Who did you pick, Trinity?

02:57.260 --> 02:58.678
- Oh, yes. Ooh, yes.

02:58.678 --> 03:02.516
- Well, I chose Vale--
I'm just kidding.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.892
[all laugh]

03:03.892 --> 03:05.143
- Yeah, right.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.104
[all laugh]

03:07.104 --> 03:08.271
- No, I picked Gia, too.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.065
I mean, girl, I told you,

03:10.065 --> 03:12.192
I'm here to play a fair game.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.570
And I want competition.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.031
And there's no reason
for Valentina to go home

03:18.031 --> 03:19.741
and for Gia to stay.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.744
Valentina, how are you feeling?

03:22.744 --> 03:24.746
- There's a lot going on
in my head right now.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.790
I had a talk with Manila

03:26.790 --> 03:29.543
where she was questioning
herself in her mind.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.002
Like, could I get rid of you,

03:31.002 --> 03:33.130
because that would really
help me achieve what I want,

03:33.130 --> 03:34.589
which is to win.

03:34.589 --> 03:38.885
And then, what I told her
was I am fierce,

03:38.885 --> 03:40.512
you are fierce,

03:40.512 --> 03:42.597
and we will make it to the top
competing together.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.849
Please let me do that.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.102
Thank you for keeping me
in the competition.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.770
- Of course. Of course.

03:48.770 --> 03:52.858
I guess I should feel grateful
to Manila in some way.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.405
But, bitch, mm-mm, no, girl.
I was not the worst,

03:58.405 --> 04:02.200
and I don't have time for her
mind games or distractions.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.077
- For a second, girl,
I was like,

04:04.077 --> 04:08.748
if she sends Valentina home,
I'm going to be pissed.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.128
I'm glad that you chose
to keep Valentina.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.546
You restored my faith

04:14.546 --> 04:16.840
in the person that
I think that you are.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.301
- The other queens fault me

04:19.301 --> 04:21.636
for weighing
both of my options equally,

04:21.636 --> 04:23.763
but I don't remember
getting no rule book

04:23.763 --> 04:26.349
in how we're supposed
to make these decisions.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.852
I'm not here to play it safe.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.812
If I find myself
in this position next time,

04:30.812 --> 04:35.150
I'm making the best decision
for my game,

04:35.150 --> 04:36.526
and I don't care
what the other girls think.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.992
- ♪ RuPaul's Drag Race ♪

04:43.992 --> 04:46.119

Oh. Last week, I landed
in the bottom three.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.276
So this week
there's a lot at stake

05:18.276 --> 05:21.696
because I want to prove
that it was just a fluke.

05:21.696 --> 05:26.117
I have a crown to win

05:26.117 --> 05:27.702
I'm feeling it, bitch.
[all laugh]

05:27.702 --> 05:30.831
- I got a wedding to pay for,

05:54.521 --> 05:57.315
your places
in Drag Race Hall of Fame

05:57.315 --> 05:58.942
ain't no sure thing.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.778
You gotta work on your GTL,

06:01.778 --> 06:06.575
as in glitter, tuck,
and lip sync.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.369
Bada boom, bada bing,
bada bam.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.664
[all laugh]

06:12.664 --> 06:15.208
- GTL, gym, tan, laundry,
"Jersey Shore."

06:15.208 --> 06:16.334
- Gym.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.086
- We don't do any of that.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.130
- Bitch, ride.
- [laughs]

06:20.130 --> 06:21.881
- Hello, hello, hello.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.758
[cheers]
- Oh!

06:23.758 --> 06:25.218
- Come on, suit!

06:25.218 --> 06:27.679
- Siberian tiger.
- Yes.

06:27.679 --> 06:31.308
Now, to make it into
the Drag Race Hall of Fame,

06:31.308 --> 06:35.103
first, you need to survive
your day in court.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.271
[gavel bangs]
- Oh!

06:36.271 --> 06:37.522
- [nervous laugh]

06:37.522 --> 06:38.356
- A little too close to home?

06:38.356 --> 06:40.025
- Right.
[all laugh]

06:40.025 --> 06:42.611
- If you recall,
from Season 4,

06:42.611 --> 06:45.113
I've been in jail,
so that...

06:46.990 --> 06:48.366
was shade.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.619
- Now, for this week's
maxi challenge,

06:50.619 --> 06:54.247
you'll be appearing
on a twisted daytime court show

06:54.247 --> 06:57.000
called "Jersey Justice."

06:57.000 --> 06:59.127
[all laugh]

06:59.127 --> 07:01.296
- Come on, "Jersey Justice."

07:01.296 --> 07:05.216
- Starring South Plainfield's
own Michelle Visage.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.801
- Yes!
- Oh, yes.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.802
- Of course.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.721
- #AllStars4

07:09.721 --> 07:13.308
You'll play
litigious Jersey litigants

07:13.308 --> 07:17.854
with big hair, big boobs,
and even bigger personalities.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.147
- [laughs]

07:19.147 --> 07:22.734
- First I need you
to break into two teams of two,

07:22.734 --> 07:24.861
and one team of three.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.154
Your choice. Go ahead.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.656
- Yeah.
- Let's do it together.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.658
- Dang, highly laminated.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.576
- Latrice, Monet, and Monique.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.954
You'll be arguing the case
"How about them cakes?"

07:34.954 --> 07:38.708
A timely dispute
between a cake maker

07:38.708 --> 07:41.378
and a discriminated customer.

07:41.378 --> 07:45.131
Naomi and Manila,
you'll be arguing the case,

07:45.131 --> 07:47.008
"You made me look
like a bitch, bitch."

07:47.008 --> 07:48.343
- Perfect!

07:48.343 --> 07:52.055
- It's all about a botched
makeover Jersey style.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.973
- Someone's going tanning.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.060
- And last but not least,
Valentina and Trinity,

07:57.060 --> 08:00.522
you'll be arguing,
"I was snookered by Snooki."

08:00.522 --> 08:01.731
- [laughs]
- Whoo!

08:01.731 --> 08:03.983
- A case of stolen identity.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.276
- Oh.

08:05.276 --> 08:08.238
- Racers, start your engines,

08:08.238 --> 08:11.032
and may the best All Star win.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.075
- Yes!
- Whoo-hoo!

08:15.328 --> 08:16.496
- Jersey.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.039
- Jersey-licious.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.332
[Jersey accent]
Listen, Your Honor.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.959
[regular voice]
I'm living for this challenge.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.503
I love me a good
daytime court show moment,

08:23.503 --> 08:26.339
like sitting at home,
watching "Judge Judy"

08:26.339 --> 08:29.050
with some Chinese food
is my life.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.510
- I want to be LaMonica.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.470
- LaMonica.
- LaMonica and LaLinda.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.640
- This week we have
an improv challenge.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.226
The key to improv is to
make sure that you are funny,

08:38.226 --> 08:39.811
and that you stay in character.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.648
You have to make sure
that everyone has their moment

08:43.648 --> 08:46.526
to have their ba-da-bomp,
ba-da-bomp, ba-da-bomp.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.027
It's not easy.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.279
- Okay, this is going to be
really cute.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.614
- Girl, this is going to be so--
- I'm so excited about this.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.116
- So what are you going to wear?

08:53.116 --> 08:54.159
- I'm gonna wear my
pink bodycon dress.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.160
Let me show y'all right here.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.161
- Where is it?

08:56.161 --> 08:57.454
- Can you not wear
a corset either?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.205
You have to have a booty-do.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.373
- What the fuck
is a booty-do?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.084
- A booty-do is when
you see a girl or a guy,

09:03.084 --> 09:04.836
and his stomach sticks out
further than...

09:04.836 --> 09:06.254
his booty do.
- His booty do.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.922
[all laugh]

09:07.922 --> 09:10.133
- The name
of our courtroom scene

09:10.133 --> 09:12.761
is called
"How about them cakes?"

09:12.761 --> 09:15.847
I am the plaintiff,
Latrice is the defendant,

09:15.847 --> 09:19.225
and her daughter is Monet.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.352
The dumpy one
with with the booty-do.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.271
So I'm very excited.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.689
I told you, Your Honor,

09:24.689 --> 09:27.192
the bitch tried to sabotage me
at my fucking wedding.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.526
- Your Honor, tell her to
call me a bitch one more time.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.111
- The fucking bitch.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.448
- You come in my shop,
you're a fucking whore.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.825
- Hello.
I'll fucking talk all day.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.076
- You took my money.
- You were--

09:37.076 --> 09:39.454
Excuse me. Excuse me.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.455
- That is--
- You have no--

09:40.455 --> 09:41.456
- Your titties are lumpy.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.874
They don't even match.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.459
- That is Balducci
from the Promenade.

09:44.459 --> 09:45.835
- Excuse me.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.588
These two are like
loud as shit.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.549
- Anna Mae?
Is that what you're doing?

09:51.549 --> 09:54.803
- These challenges
can easily go south

09:54.803 --> 09:57.430
when one or two
overpower another.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.432
So stop screaming.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.392
- This is kind of like
a big life moment for me.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.310
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.020
- Oh, my gosh.

10:04.020 --> 10:04.938
- It feels like I haven't
seen you in forever, bitch.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.606
- That's so cute.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.776
- It's fucking nuts
working with Manila Luzon.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.113
That 11th grader in me
is shaking.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.447
[laughs]

10:14.447 --> 10:15.782
I'm going to be a salon owner,

10:15.782 --> 10:18.368
and you're going to be
the upset makeover victim.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.120
- Oh, I'm suing you.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.248
How dare you
ruin my makeup like this.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.333
I'm feeling pretty good
about Naomi

10:25.333 --> 10:27.544
because she did really great
at Snatch Game

10:27.544 --> 10:30.213
and she's been safe
and consistent.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.799
But she just needs
to get it there.

10:32.799 --> 10:36.886
So I'm giving Naomi everything
she needs in order to succeed

10:36.886 --> 10:40.139
and be in the top with me,
because I'm fucking fierce.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.432
Hello.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.852
We have to make it
really comedic.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.020
Like, the more over-the-top
crazy Jersey we look,

10:46.020 --> 10:49.148
like, hoop earrings
and the nails and the big hair.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.859
- Yeah.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.735
- So I think I'm going
to be a little more nasally.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.612
You know, like Fran Drescher
a little bit.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.614
- And you have to be
kind of like meekish.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.199
- Yeah, because it says
that I'm ditzy and gullible.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.659
- Yeah.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.786
- I'm going to channel...

11:01.786 --> 11:05.164
Farrah Moan from Jersey.
- [laughs]

11:05.164 --> 11:07.584
- My name
is Snooki McSnookowitz.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.336
- Don't go country
with your accent, girl.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.256
My case is
"I was snookered by Snooki."

11:13.256 --> 11:16.217
And I'm a little nervous
about Valentina,

11:16.217 --> 11:19.137
because she's not known
for being funny, honey.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.097
- You think I should talk
with a voice like this?

11:21.097 --> 11:23.975
- Yeah.
She needs to be loud.

11:23.975 --> 11:27.270
- She needs to be loud.
Okay, uh, no.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.690
Maybe she talks in this tone,
like a Jersey girl.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.442
Girl, girl.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.819
- Girl. Girl.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.237
- Goil.
- Joisey goil.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.989
- Joisey girl.
- Girl.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.199
- Girl?

11:40.199 --> 11:42.952
- I wanna go in there and know
exactly what I'm going to do,

11:42.952 --> 11:45.371
and attack it,
and like, not fuck it up

11:45.371 --> 11:46.623
and know it at every second.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.458
I'm really hard on myself.

11:48.458 --> 11:53.171
And when I start
to get overwhelmed,

11:53.171 --> 11:55.590
my brain,
it starts to go in circles,

11:55.590 --> 11:57.800
and I start to think
of too many things at once

11:57.800 --> 11:59.844
and I start to get doubtful.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.804
And I start to feel like,
oh, my God,

12:01.804 --> 12:05.683
there's so much
going on in my head. Oh...

12:05.683 --> 12:08.770
I can do voices, bitch.
I can do voices.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.522
But the improv, that's
going to be my challenge.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.733
Knowing my story
and making it funny,

12:13.733 --> 12:16.361
because I will have the voice,
I will have the look.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.446
But the way my brain works

12:18.446 --> 12:20.281
is where I'm going
to have the challenge.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.491
- If you're having doubt,

12:21.491 --> 12:23.785
I can do whatever character
I need to do.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.703
Bitch, I will be the mom.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.955
Or I can be Snooki.
You tell me.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.834
Improv is about
thinking quick,

12:31.834 --> 12:33.753
but also working as a team.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.090
And Valentina is not about
to bring me down, honey.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.051
I need to continue to do well
in this competition.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.053
I don't need
to be in the bottom.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.764
So, sweetie,
you better get it together.

12:46.849 --> 12:50.186
- You are about to enter the
courtroom of Michelle Visage.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.063
- Y'all ready
for some "Jersey Justice?"

12:52.063 --> 12:53.856
- [chanting]
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

12:53.856 --> 12:55.108
- The shade is real.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.651
- I don't got time
for this shit.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.236
- The tans are fake.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.989
- Come on, I got a tanning
appointment to go to.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.408
- And the bailiff
is shirtless.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.786
This is "Jersey Justice."

13:06.786 --> 13:08.204
This is the plaintiff.

13:08.204 --> 13:12.917
She's suing a salon owner
for over $5.000,

13:12.917 --> 13:14.877
claiming she made her
look like a bitch

13:14.877 --> 13:16.671
at her high school reunion.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.009
This is the defendant.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.137
She claims the plaintiff
is telling a "tail"

13:24.137 --> 13:26.806
and actually looks
quite fetching.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.980
- All rise for the smoking hot
judge Michelle Visage.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.566
[cheers and hoots]

13:40.361 --> 13:41.529
- All right, all right,
all right, all right.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.197
Sit down, sit down.
Hey, Tony.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.657
- Hey, Your Honor.
How you doin'?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.576
- I notice you didn't
call me Honorable.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.327
Is that because of last night
in my chambers?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.788
- Uh, yeah.
Uh, go with that, I guess.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.124
- Y'all ready
for some "Jersey Justice?"

13:53.124 --> 13:55.001
[cheers]

13:56.627 --> 13:59.380
Order in the Court.
Order in the Court!

13:59.380 --> 14:01.841
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

14:01.841 --> 14:04.218
the whole truth,
or something like the truth,

14:04.218 --> 14:05.845
so help you Jon Bon Jovi?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.346
- Something like the truth.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.432
- I swear. Shit.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.018
- Plaintiff, what's your name?

14:12.018 --> 14:15.229
- Tiffani with two "I's"
dotted with hearts.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.439
- Defendant.

14:16.439 --> 14:20.151
- Stefani with an "I,"
Angelyne with a "Y",

14:20.151 --> 14:23.738
Ricotta like the cheese,
Permanata.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.073
- Obviously Jewish.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.783
- Five point stars.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.160
- Yes. What's your story,
Tiffani?

14:29.160 --> 14:32.163
- So I was walking down Spa Row,

14:32.163 --> 14:34.874
and I saw a truck,
you know, like a food truck.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.376
But it was a travel salon.

14:37.376 --> 14:40.046
So I thought I would go in
and get my hair did

14:40.046 --> 14:42.757
and get a makeover,
because I'm trying to get ready

14:42.757 --> 14:46.385
for my 20th high school reunion.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.514
And I came out looking
like a mother-tucking dog.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.016
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.185
- Okay, show us.
Take it off.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.853
Just take it off.
- Okay, okay.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.773
I feel like a stripper.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.609
- Oh.
[audience laughs]

15:01.609 --> 15:02.944
- I look like a dog.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.279
- That's couture.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.572
- I was going to the mall

15:06.572 --> 15:09.283
to get a cute dress
for the reunion,

15:09.283 --> 15:10.660
and they wouldn't even
let me in the store

15:10.660 --> 15:12.912
because I wasn't
a service animal.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.997
[audience laughs]

15:14.997 --> 15:17.792
I waited 20 years to come back

15:17.792 --> 15:21.045
looking like
this sexy, hot bitch,

15:21.045 --> 15:23.798
and now I just look like
a frickin' bitch.

15:23.798 --> 15:24.841
[audience laughs]

15:24.841 --> 15:26.384
- What do you want?

15:26.384 --> 15:29.470
- I want $5.000.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.014
- Do you know how many dresses
at Wet Seal

15:32.014 --> 15:34.350
I could get with $5.000?

15:34.350 --> 15:38.062
- I do.
- $5.000 for damages,

15:38.062 --> 15:42.441
and $11.75
for this flea collar

15:42.441 --> 15:45.444
that she somehow bamboozled me
into purchasing,

15:45.444 --> 15:47.196
even though
it's not even my color.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.407
[laughter]

15:49.407 --> 15:51.492
- Defendant,
what do you do for a living?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.286
- I am a hair stylist.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.912
- What's the name
of your salon, Stefani?

15:54.912 --> 15:56.956
- The name of my salon
is Bitchin' Beauty.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.916
I've had it for 19 years.

15:58.916 --> 16:03.546
It's attached to my boyfriend
Vinny's '87 Mustang.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.757
- What kind of clientele
do you host at Bitchin' Salon?

16:06.757 --> 16:09.969
- Well, they normally
got four legs,

16:09.969 --> 16:12.680
they normally got
some anal glands going on,

16:12.680 --> 16:15.099
and they normally need
their fleas and ticks treated.

16:15.099 --> 16:18.603
- You own a dog-grooming salon?

16:18.603 --> 16:20.771
- And when she came in
smelling like a wet dog,

16:20.771 --> 16:22.398
I just said let's get to work.

16:22.398 --> 16:26.319
- Naomi has
a distinctive character,

16:26.319 --> 16:30.239
and she is bronzed and
Cheeto-tanned the house down.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.451
But Miss Manila
is clearly a star.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.662
- How is it possible
that you could not see

16:36.662 --> 16:38.956
that you were entering
a dog salon?

16:38.956 --> 16:41.918
- I have not been wearing
my glasses so much so,

16:41.918 --> 16:44.754
because I think I look
prettier without them.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.173
- Stefani, how could you not see

16:47.173 --> 16:49.800
that this was a human being
walking into your dog truck?

16:49.800 --> 16:53.429
- How can you not see that she
doesn't look like a human being?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.306
- This is my courtroom.
You don't talk to me that way.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.682
- Ooh. Ooh.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.018
- No. She's a human.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.353
You have a dog truck.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.479
They don't go.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.522
- Your Honor,
I look like shit.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.734
- You prostitution labrador,
how dare you?

17:06.734 --> 17:09.320
- You two disgust me.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.197
You get out of here,
the both of you. Get out!

17:11.197 --> 17:13.491
Case dismissed.
You and that ratchet-ass dog--

17:13.491 --> 17:15.117
- Her name is Panini.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.410
- Go!
- How dare you?

17:16.410 --> 17:18.746
- What about my $5.000?
- Ricotta Fromunda--

17:18.746 --> 17:20.581
- Your Highness--
- You, gone!

17:20.581 --> 17:21.999
- You're not getting the $5.000.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.626
[yipping voice]
- I want my $5.000.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.419
Arf, arf, arf!

17:25.419 --> 17:27.004
- Case dismissed.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.589
I am not scared of you.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.882
- I want my $5.000.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.342
- Sounds like the litigants

17:31.342 --> 17:32.343
are coming out
of the courtroom right now.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.844
Let's see if we can get
a word with them.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.763
Hey, ladies, hello, hello.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.016
Now, listen, "Jersey Justice,"
was it served today?

17:39.016 --> 17:41.310
- No. I want my money.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.770
[yipping voice]
I want my money.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.897
Arf, arf, arf, arf!
- Oh, okay.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.857
- Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.025
- Okay, all right, ladies.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.360
We're going to get ready
for the next case.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.237
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.490
- This is the plaintiff.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.242
She's suing a bakery owner

17:56.242 --> 17:59.370
for ruining her wedding
with a disrespectful dessert.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.292
This is the defendant.

18:04.292 --> 18:07.086
She claims that when it comes
to serving cakes,

18:07.086 --> 18:09.422
she never disappoints.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.343
- You guys swear
to tell the truth?

18:14.343 --> 18:15.344
If not,
I'll put a hit out on you.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.054
- For sure.
- Got it.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.973
- All right, plaintiff,
what's your name?

18:18.973 --> 18:21.642
- My name is
Anastasia Ravioli Ragu.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.977
Yes, I'm a part
of the Ragu family.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.979
I got married last Friday.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.647
- How old are you?
- I'm 26.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.441
- 26. Okay,
you're getting married at 26.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.234
Good for you.
- Yeah.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.485
You can't look like this
forever.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.530
- So why are you here,
Anastasia?

18:34.530 --> 18:35.698
- So the defendant
is a family friend.

18:35.698 --> 18:36.741
Went to school
with her daughter.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.534
She owns a bakery.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.952
I said, oh, my God,
I'm getting married.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.829
She's black, I'm black.
I support black businesses.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.164
It'll be great.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.082
You know,
upbringing the community.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.709
And I tell her
that I want the cake to say

18:46.709 --> 18:49.545
"Anastasia and Bobby,
true love forever."

18:49.545 --> 18:51.005
- Okay.

18:51.005 --> 18:54.133
- What I get the day of,
horrible train wreck,

18:54.133 --> 18:55.676
like sabotaged
and booby-trapped.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.219
What the hell? I don't know.
- Is that the cake right there?

18:57.219 --> 18:58.971
- This is the cake right here.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.599
- I'm watching Latrice
keeping quiet

19:01.599 --> 19:03.851
and just kind of letting Monique
steal the focus.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.104
This was her chance to have her
redemption from her Snatch Game.

19:07.104 --> 19:11.442
Latrice has to bring it
times two, times 10.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.527
- So first of all, Your Honor,

19:13.527 --> 19:15.529
she puts white people
on the cake.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.822
[audience laughs]
- Where's the tanner?

19:16.822 --> 19:19.450
Oh, my gosh.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.410
It says Lisa.
My name's Anastasia.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.745
- Oh, boy. Okay.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.664
- So it says
"Lisa is a total skank

19:24.664 --> 19:26.540
and everyone knows it."

19:26.540 --> 19:29.085
They call her a door knob.
A door knob?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.420
- Everybody gets a turn?
- Yeah.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.756
So, Your Honor,
I'm suing for $500.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.466
- Okay.
- The price of the cake.

19:35.466 --> 19:38.052
But then also,
I want an additional 5.000.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.512
- For? Okay.
- Pain and suffering.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.554
Emotional distress.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.682
I was called a whore,
a door knob.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.059
She's over there looking
like a big butter-turkey-ball.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.352
Like what's going on?

19:46.352 --> 19:48.187
- Defendant, what's your name?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.730
- I'm Anna Mae.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.900
I've known the plaintiff
for her whole entire life.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.319
Basically her and my daughter
grew up together,

19:55.319 --> 19:57.905
they went to school together,
they were good friends.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.198
She turned into a whore.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.199
- Are you going to call me
a whore?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.659
You're going to use that--

20:01.659 --> 20:03.994
- You're on your frickin'
second marriage at 26.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.330
- Security.
You want to call me a whore.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.457
- Security?

20:08.457 --> 20:09.542
Sugar daddy.

20:10.793 --> 20:14.088
- Latrice, Latrice, Latrice.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.340
[snores]

20:17.925 --> 20:19.260
Where are the jokes?

20:19.260 --> 20:22.388
- Did you or did you not
make that cake?

20:22.388 --> 20:25.391
- We at Anna Mae's would
never do work like this.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.351
- Objectify.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.270
Objectify.
- What?

20:29.270 --> 20:30.646
- Objectify.
- No, baby.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.440
- Now, what's--
- I don't need you to talk.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.817
I let you speak.
- Oh, my gosh.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.569
- I don't know how that
inscription got on there.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.361
I don't even know
what that inscription is.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.946
This is not my handwriting.

20:38.946 --> 20:44.034
- Well, lucky for you I had them
analyze the handwriting.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.119
- Oh, really?

20:45.119 --> 20:47.163
- And I would like
to present to you

20:47.163 --> 20:49.081
a hostile witness!

20:51.584 --> 20:54.503
Look familiar, Anna Mae?

20:54.503 --> 20:55.796
- Mama, let me tell you
something.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.298
Hello, Your Honor.
How are you?

20:57.298 --> 20:58.757
- First of all,
what's your name?

20:58.757 --> 21:00.259
- You wanna know my name?
- I asked you your name.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.594
- Okay, well,
you said I'm hostile.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.887
You seem a little hostile
yourself. Just saying.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.263
- This is my court, bitch.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.098
- Respect your elders.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.766
Taught you better than that.
- Clearly not.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.561
- Your Honor, my name is Alexis.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.146
- Your Honor,
she brought a 40.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.772
- I tend to get thirsty,
Your Honor.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.107
[audience laughs]

21:15.107 --> 21:16.692
- Tell me your story.
Why are you here?

21:16.692 --> 21:17.902
- Okay, Your Honor,
first of all,

21:17.902 --> 21:19.612
yes, I did write on that cake,
but there's--

21:19.612 --> 21:20.696
- You wrote on the cake?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.406
- Mama, just a second.
- What?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.033
I did, but here's the reason.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.410
Because she is
a nasty, skanky whore.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.789
Anastasia Fettuccine Alfredo
Ragu Al Dente Pasta--

21:29.789 --> 21:31.790
- Watch your fucking language.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.292
Do you kiss your mother
with that fucking mouth?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.627
- And my boyfriend, Your Honor.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.003
[audience laughs]

21:36.003 --> 21:37.004
So here's the story.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.631
So we've been best friends
forever.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.673
- Best friends?
- Since elementary school.

21:39.673 --> 21:40.674
We were on the playground,

21:40.674 --> 21:42.468
and I was together
in fourth grade.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.220
Me and Bobby Z
started going steady.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.639
We were on the topsy-turvy
going round and round,

21:46.639 --> 21:49.683
and Miss Anastasia
spins the bitch too fast.

21:49.683 --> 21:53.062
I get nauseous after
my pesto alfredo sauce pasta,

21:53.062 --> 21:54.271
what we had for lunch.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.565
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.400
- Monet was doing a great job
and she was funny,

21:58.400 --> 22:00.194
but then it just lost the story.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.779
- So she spunned it

22:01.779 --> 22:03.906
and made me throw up on Bobby Z
on his Cavaricci jeans.

22:03.906 --> 22:04.782
- Baloney. That never
happened, Your Honor.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.116
- Because of that whore.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.660
- I still don't understand
the cake,

22:07.660 --> 22:09.703
and how the writing
got on the cake,

22:09.703 --> 22:11.789
and why the mom and the dau--
I still don't get it.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.249
- In seventh grade, do you know

22:13.249 --> 22:15.334
that she let the whole
varsity and junior varsity team

22:15.334 --> 22:16.961
do things to her?

22:16.961 --> 22:18.963
- In high school, I had
the nickname Miss Head Quarters.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.256
You know what I'm saying?

22:20.256 --> 22:21.882
- She was giving head
for 25 cents.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.008
- Excuse me, it was a quarter.
It was not 25 cents.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.177
- That's 25 cents.
- It was a quarter.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.887
- This is why you
should have went to college

22:26.887 --> 22:28.472
instead of working
for your mother.

22:28.472 --> 22:33.435
- And a saucier ragu pennine
alfredo penne vodka pasta,

22:33.435 --> 22:35.688
you are a nasty slut
and a whore.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.232
- Oh, my gosh, bitch.

22:38.232 --> 22:39.817
- That's my daughter, bitch!

22:39.817 --> 22:41.443
- Oh!

22:41.443 --> 22:44.280
- You raggedy--
you raggedy bitch!

22:44.280 --> 22:45.739
- Oh!

22:45.739 --> 22:47.908
[gong sounds]

22:50.327 --> 22:52.079
- Stop this right now!

22:52.079 --> 22:54.290
Stop this!

22:55.541 --> 22:57.543
Somebody get me a piece of cake.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.420
Tony!

22:59.420 --> 23:01.463
- Hashtag, that bitch
got beat with a cake.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.674
- This is real buttercream.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.634
- Anastasia, over here.
- Never mess with my daughter.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.761
You never disrespect
my daughter.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.264
- It was supposed to be
red velvet.

23:10.264 --> 23:12.057
- Zip it. Alexis, you.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.477
Anastasia, you.
Approach the bench.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.730
Believe it or not,
I have been called a whore.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.566
I have been called a slut.
I have been called a trollop.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.693
But my girlfriends and I,

23:22.693 --> 23:24.111
can I tell you
how we used to make up?

23:24.111 --> 23:26.238
We'd make out.
[audience laughs]

23:26.238 --> 23:28.240
So why don't you guys
give it a shot?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.658
Just make out.
It'll make it all better.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.540
There you go.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.667
Yay! Perfect.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.589
[audience laughs]

23:43.589 --> 23:45.466
- Case dismissed.
Love wins.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.181
- Monique better pray to Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints

23:52.181 --> 23:56.060
that the judges are judging us
on individual parts,

23:56.060 --> 23:58.562
because Monet and Latrice
are a hot mess.

23:58.562 --> 24:01.857
It's a hot shitty mess.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.151
- Welcome back
to "Jersey Justice."

24:04.151 --> 24:06.779
The hair is big,
the nails are sharp,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.614
and the rulings are ridiculous.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.075
This is the plaintiff.

24:11.075 --> 24:14.036
She's suing an entertainer
for $1 million

24:14.036 --> 24:16.455
for being a Snook-alike.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.542
- Where's the other one?

24:20.542 --> 24:22.086
- She's always late.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.462
- Listen, I got a tanning
appointment.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.171
We gotta wrap this up.
So let's just get this started.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.631
- Sure.
- Great.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.634
What's your name?
- My name is...

24:31.679 --> 24:34.264
Fisha Pice.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.475
- Tell me, Fisha,
whatcha doing here?

24:36.475 --> 24:39.978
- I have three lovely daughters
at home that look up to me.

24:39.978 --> 24:43.148
And I wanted to do something
nice for their birthday.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.275
And they love Snooki.

24:45.275 --> 24:48.529
So I got my pool boy Ronnie
to show me

24:48.529 --> 24:50.489
how to get on the Faces of Book.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.242
- Uh-huh.
- And I messaged Snooki.

24:53.242 --> 24:57.371
And I invite her over
for some lasagna and $2.500,

24:57.371 --> 25:00.541
just to, you know, casually
hang out with my daughterses.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.000
- So where's it all go wrong?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.294
- She comes in three hours

25:04.294 --> 25:07.423
past when she's supposed
to be there, Your Judge.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.841
And she looks a hot mess.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.176
- It says here you're suing
for $1 million.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.595
- She embarrassed me
in front of my community.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.681
I got snookered by Snooki.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.308
- All right,
well, you know what?

25:18.308 --> 25:20.144
I'm about to throw this case
out the window.

25:20.144 --> 25:22.271
I don't got time for this.
- Oh, sorry, I'm late.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.523
- Oh.
- Sorry I'm late.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.983
- This is the defendant.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.609
She claims she's innocent

25:27.609 --> 25:30.320
and that the plaintiff
misread the situation.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.368
- Well, look who finally decided
to show up in our courtroom.

25:36.368 --> 25:40.205
- Valentina's look,
oh, my God, amazing.

25:40.205 --> 25:43.375
Girl, she looks like
she just left the strip club.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.671
Had one too many tequilas
and a few whiskey shots, okay?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.965
She's that girl. Stunning.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.468
- I am the OG Snooki,
look at me.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.386
From Secaucus.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.929
- She looks like a sarcophagus.

25:55.929 --> 25:57.055
[audience laughs]
- Oh, yes.

25:57.055 --> 26:00.100
- She's nothing
like she is on TV.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.602
- Snooki, tell me your story.

26:01.602 --> 26:05.856
- Okay. So I work at the Kitty
Kat Paddy Whack, you know.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.066
I work there.
I strip there.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.359
I live there.

26:09.359 --> 26:12.613
And now this whore wants
to sue me for $1 million.

26:12.613 --> 26:15.073
- You're lucky
I don't crrrrr ya.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.119
- You say you're the OG Snooki.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.663
I happen to know a lot
about "Jersey Shore,"

26:21.663 --> 26:23.749
so let me ask you
some questions.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.667
What does GTL stand for?

26:25.667 --> 26:27.836
- Giant titty lady.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.880
- She's wrong.
- She's wrong.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.423
What is the female version
of a guido called?

26:31.423 --> 26:33.258
- Cheeto.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.384
- No! Wrong!

26:34.384 --> 26:36.136
- I use it to contour.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.805
- We can see that, you bitch.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.559
- Okay, Snooki,
if you're the real Snooki,

26:42.559 --> 26:43.977
show me some identification.

26:45.854 --> 26:49.358
- Oh, well, what do you know,
Your Honor?

26:49.358 --> 26:50.442
I don't know the rules.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.653
Do I give this over to you
or to him?

26:52.653 --> 26:53.946
- What have you got there?

26:53.946 --> 26:55.531
- Well,
it's my birth certificate.

26:55.531 --> 26:56.740
Here are the facts.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.075
What do you know?
Bada bing, bada boom.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.953
- Let me take a look
at that birth certification.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.539
"Snooki McSnookowitz."

27:03.539 --> 27:06.959
Date of birth 1985.

27:06.959 --> 27:11.839
The real Snooki
was born in 1987.

27:11.839 --> 27:15.342
You are the OG Snooki.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.219
- That's a lie, Your Honor.
- Well, what do you know.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.096
Bada bing, bada boom.
- I call contempt.

27:19.096 --> 27:21.390
- Come take a look.
Totally legit.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.519
[gasps]

27:25.519 --> 27:27.312
- Oh, you fucking whore!

27:29.773 --> 27:31.024
- You bitch!

27:31.024 --> 27:32.234
- You look like
fucking Joan Rivers,

27:32.234 --> 27:33.277
you fucking whore!

27:33.277 --> 27:35.279
- Oh!
- Hey!

27:35.279 --> 27:37.447
- You ungrateful
oil slick tramp.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.408
I'm gonna kill you.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.410
- Oh!

27:41.410 --> 27:43.453
- Whoa! Whoa!

27:43.453 --> 27:46.248
[gavel pounds]

27:46.248 --> 27:47.624
- Stop it!
Stop it right now!

27:47.624 --> 27:48.750
Stop it!

27:50.335 --> 27:52.212
Stop it!

27:52.212 --> 27:54.006
Order in the court!

27:56.341 --> 27:57.926
- Oh! Let me up!

27:57.926 --> 27:59.052
Let me up!

27:59.052 --> 28:02.139
- God bless the Garden State!

28:02.139 --> 28:03.348
- All right, we're gonna see

28:03.348 --> 28:05.058
if we can get a word
from the litigants

28:05.058 --> 28:07.060
as they leave
the courtroom here.

28:07.060 --> 28:10.689
So, uh, you brought a case
against this lady right here.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.524
Are you happy with the decision?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.610
- No, absolutely not.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.569
- How do you feel about it?

28:15.569 --> 28:16.570
- I feel good.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.697
I just won a $1 million.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.408
- Okay, I think she believes
she won $1 million.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.993
Listen, will you
ever bring a case

28:22.993 --> 28:25.495
against anybody
in New Jersey ever again?

28:25.495 --> 28:26.997
- Absolutely not.

28:26.997 --> 28:30.417
I'm going to take care of it
myself the old-fashion way.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.377
- All right. Thank you, ladies.
Thank you very much.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.837
- Can you go get my car,
sweetheart?

28:33.837 --> 28:34.963
Thank you.
- Sure.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.299
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.802
Just remember, if you break
the law, don't do it in Jersey.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.934
- Are butterflies
still in fashion?

28:46.934 --> 28:47.935
[all laugh]

28:47.935 --> 28:49.436
- Girl.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.563
- It is a brand-new morning
in the workroom.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.815
I left my Jersey girl
on the Turnpike.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.568
The runway look today
is curves and swerves,

28:56.568 --> 28:58.028
padded for the gods.

28:58.028 --> 29:01.198
And I'm ready to get these
curves and swerves popping,

29:01.198 --> 29:02.240
and hopefully get a chance

29:02.240 --> 29:04.284
to lip sync
for some money, girl.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.579
- Okay, today's look
is very lazy, very cas,

29:07.579 --> 29:08.747
but still in designer.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.249
Prada, Prada,
St. Laurent, and Zara.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.459
- Cute.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.044
- Give me a break.

29:14.044 --> 29:16.129
- Girl, what's going on
over there with your hair?

29:16.129 --> 29:17.631
- I'm giving you
Kenya Kardashian, girl.

29:17.631 --> 29:19.007
[all laugh]

29:19.007 --> 29:20.342
- Coming into the workroom,

29:20.342 --> 29:23.720
everyone is feeling confident.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.806
But, America,
in this competition,

29:25.806 --> 29:27.265
anything can happen.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.643
And someone is going home.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.019
- Oh, how cute.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.188
This is fabulous.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.357
- It's all about proportions,
right?

29:35.357 --> 29:38.235
I'm very happy with my
"Jersey Justice" performance.

29:38.235 --> 29:41.613
And I feel like Naomi and I
are topping tonight.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.491
Not each other. [laughs]

29:44.491 --> 29:46.201
How do you think
you did yesterday?

29:46.201 --> 29:48.787
- We were hilarious.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.789
- Because I know that I saw
in the beginning

29:50.789 --> 29:53.000
you were very--
you were holding back.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.170
- For my part,
it wasn't very much story.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.338
- Do you think
that's going to hurt you?

29:58.338 --> 29:59.715
- Hurt me?

29:59.715 --> 30:01.299
It shouldn't hurt me.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.510
I thought we were
entertaining as hell.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.762
- I feel like we all have
no idea until the judges--

30:05.762 --> 30:07.723
- My thing is like, okay,

30:07.723 --> 30:10.559
say our group
is in the bottom.

30:10.559 --> 30:13.186
I don't even--I can't see
how that can happen.

30:13.186 --> 30:16.314
- Latrice is feeling
really confident right now,

30:16.314 --> 30:19.735
but I personally feel like
she could have done better.

30:19.735 --> 30:24.406
So I'm worried that my friend
is going to be in the bottom.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.909
- I feel like we did
such an amazing job.

30:27.909 --> 30:31.204
I know within my heart
that I did amazing.

30:31.204 --> 30:34.416
And I'm really excited
about my runway

30:34.416 --> 30:36.293
'cause I'm really pushing
outside of my box.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.128
So I have nothing
to worry about.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.338
I'm gonna win this challenge
no matter what.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.216
- You definitely, like,
made up for the Snatch Game.

30:43.216 --> 30:44.259
- Yeah.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.469
- And proved why you're here.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.179
I think I did really good.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.306
I think that we worked
really well together.

30:49.306 --> 30:51.808
- Mm-hmm. We do
because we're good old pals.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.227
- Can I ask you a question?

30:54.227 --> 30:55.228
Because this has been
bothering me.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.355
- What?
- So when you first came in,

30:57.355 --> 30:58.690
when Michelle told you
to introduce--

30:58.690 --> 31:00.233
who are you,
what are you here for?

31:00.233 --> 31:02.652
- Uh-huh.
- Did you forget your name?

31:02.652 --> 31:04.279
- For a quick second, yeah.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.572
- Okay.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.282
- It was like...Fisha Pice.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.618
- Okay. All right.
[laughs]

31:09.618 --> 31:10.911
Okay.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.120
- It was for a quick second,
bitch.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.663
- Do you know
how long that takes?

31:13.663 --> 31:15.457
A second is a long time.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.375
If I asked you what's your name,
and you're like...

31:17.375 --> 31:19.669
- But I ain't worried
about that, girl,

31:19.669 --> 31:20.962
because my performance
overall was sick.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.172
- Right.

31:22.172 --> 31:24.091
- Girl, my performance was good.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.634
She needs to be
worrying about herself,

31:25.634 --> 31:28.845
not worried about
if I fumbled one word

31:28.845 --> 31:31.139
when she fumbled
the entire bit.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.974
Crashed and burned, bitch.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.684
Nobody was perfect.

31:34.684 --> 31:35.727
- Nobody was perfect, but--
- So everybody had that--

31:35.727 --> 31:37.479
- Something. Yeah.
- That second.

31:37.479 --> 31:38.814
- I started off slow.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.107
- Well.
- Well.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.983
- Well, girl, let's be real.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.235
- I think--

31:43.235 --> 31:44.694
- Let's be honest, girl.
- Tell me.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.363
- Where were the jokes?

31:46.363 --> 31:48.573
Where were the jokes?

31:48.573 --> 31:50.075
- Bitch, I had jokes.

31:50.075 --> 31:53.662
And I know the people who needed
to catch them, caught them.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.915
- It wasn't your best, Latrice.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.375
Let's just say that, okay?

31:58.375 --> 32:00.752
But at the end of the day, like,

32:00.752 --> 32:02.963
no one wants to send
your ass home, bitch.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.422
- Girl, you're so beloved.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.424
If this is your time
to be in the bottom,

32:06.424 --> 32:07.634
you ain't going home.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.469
Ain't nobody wants you
to go home.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.054
- Well, I don't want to be here
just because of that.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.597
- So I guess we'll see.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.641
- I guess we'll see.

32:20.772 --> 32:21.606
- I mean, if you aren't fucking
trying it, you're trying it.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.109
- Well, let me ask you this.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.819
What if I'm in the bottom two

32:25.819 --> 32:29.239
and you win the lip sync?

32:29.239 --> 32:31.241
- I'm sending
your ass home, bitch,

32:31.241 --> 32:33.410
because sending Latrice home,
that's too much.

32:33.410 --> 32:38.206
- You would send me home
when I would have saved you?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.499
- She's the dearly beloved.

32:41.084 --> 32:44.254
- What did you just say?

32:44.254 --> 32:49.176
So this is how Villain-tina
is going to play the game?

32:49.176 --> 32:51.261
Ha-ha-ha.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.346
Oh, no, sweetie.

You fucking

35:49.647 --> 35:54.486
- My look is inspired
by Alexander Moo-Queen.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.863
#Exaggerate.

35:56.863 --> 35:59.949
- I really like
the way she moo-ves.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.327
- I tell you, I could watch this
till the cows come home.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.828
[all laugh]

36:03.828 --> 36:04.954
- Latrice Royale.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.831
- Beaded for the gods.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.000
- Yes. Is it me
or does she look stoned?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.418
[all laugh]

36:10.418 --> 36:13.505
- I am feeling
my absolute most gorgeous.

36:13.505 --> 36:17.509
I have on
the most sickening gown.

36:17.509 --> 36:21.221
Baby, you cannot tell me I'm not
loving and living for myself.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.014
- So that's where
all my candy went.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.182
[all laugh]

36:24.182 --> 36:25.683
- Monet X Change.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.102
- She can pop my cork any day.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.104
- Ooh, bottoms up.

36:29.104 --> 36:32.524
- It's so funny. That's exactly
how I store my glasses.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.067
[all laugh]
- I'm paying homage

36:34.067 --> 36:37.028
to one of the biggest
booty bitches in the business,

36:37.028 --> 36:38.780
Ms. Kim Kardashian.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.658
I am the fourth Kardashian,
Kenya Kardashian.

36:41.658 --> 36:44.035
[pop]
- Oh!

36:44.035 --> 36:45.245
[all laugh]

36:46.663 --> 36:48.540
- Welcome, ladies.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.127
Now, before we proceed,

36:52.127 --> 36:54.587
I need you to apologize

36:54.587 --> 36:59.592
to anyone who has ever
lived in, lived by,

36:59.592 --> 37:04.013
or visited the great state
of New Jersey.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.057
- Bada bing, bada boom.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.267
- Sorry, baby.

37:07.267 --> 37:10.061
- Good. Well,
that should clear things up.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.022
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

37:13.022 --> 37:15.650
First up, Manila Luzon.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.569
- I love pink on you.
I think it looks really pretty.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.820
- Thank you.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.405
- I get the padding
in the fabric,

37:20.405 --> 37:22.615
so I understand
that is your interpretation.

37:22.615 --> 37:23.658
You look beautiful.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.785
- I love that in the challenge,

37:25.785 --> 37:28.830
you were a French poodle,

37:28.830 --> 37:30.498
and now you've stuck with that

37:30.498 --> 37:31.708
and you're wearing
a French designer.

37:31.708 --> 37:33.501
It's obviously
an homage to Chanel.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.378
- Yeah, a little Rococo Chanel.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.964
- Right. Improv's not easy,

37:37.964 --> 37:40.717
and I thought your performance
was really, really great.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.677
- I loved
that you snuck a bark

37:42.677 --> 37:44.262
kind of in the middle
of that whole thing,

37:44.262 --> 37:46.598
which I thought that was
a really, really fun detail.

37:46.598 --> 37:47.974
- You were fully committed.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.893
You were really fun.

37:49.893 --> 37:50.894
- Thank you.

37:50.894 --> 37:53.646
- Up next, Naomi Smalls.

37:53.646 --> 37:56.566
- This particular look,
I live for it.

37:56.566 --> 37:58.193
I love drag
that when you come out,

37:58.193 --> 38:00.195
we automatically get the story.

38:00.195 --> 38:01.196
We know what you're selling.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.781
I'm looking around,

38:02.781 --> 38:04.282
you're giving us some great
swerves and curves here.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.201
- Your booty looks crazy.

38:06.201 --> 38:08.119
- What you're serving
is delicious.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.787
Even though it's burnt.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.957
- In the "Jersey Justice"
challenge,

38:12.957 --> 38:16.002
you absolutely looked like
you were from New Jersey.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.754
- Thanks.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.006
- Leopard print obviously is
my favorite color in the world.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.217
- [laughs]

38:22.217 --> 38:24.177
- The only thing
I wanted from you was more.

38:24.177 --> 38:29.599
I felt like you were not giving
as much as Manila was giving.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.269
- When you first
walked into the challenge,

38:33.269 --> 38:35.146
I thought I can't wait.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.983
Unfortunately, I think you
kind of got lost in the scene.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.903
But the look,
it was absolutely priceless.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.154
- Thank you.

38:43.154 --> 38:46.115
- Up next, Trinity The Tuck.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.575
- Let's talk about your outfit.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.911
It actually is my favorite
outfit on the runway today.

38:49.911 --> 38:52.205
- I'd love to borrow
your thighs.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.290
They look amazing.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.708
- I'll take you to my doctor.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.669
- Thank you.
[all laugh]

38:57.669 --> 38:58.920
- You have come
a really long way

38:58.920 --> 39:01.214
with knowing that you're funny.

39:01.214 --> 39:04.175
But I just think
this kind of stalled for you.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.219
I wanted you to just keep going.
- Yeah.

39:06.219 --> 39:07.720
- Keep filling me up
with your story.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.641
- I think I was just scared
to overstep Valentina,

39:11.641 --> 39:15.270
because I wanted us both
to have our moment.

39:15.270 --> 39:17.188
- You know, not wanting
to overshadow Valentina

39:17.188 --> 39:19.607
is very nice, but it puts you
in a difficult position.

39:19.607 --> 39:20.984
So don't hold back.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.027
- So you're basically saying
fuck Valentina.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.321
- You know, it's a competition.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.281
Do what you need to do.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.323
- You know, do you want to win

39:27.323 --> 39:28.408
or do you want
a participation ribbon?

39:28.408 --> 39:29.659
That's really
what it boils down to.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.453
- Thank you.
- Up next, Valentina.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.289
- Hello.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.832
- I love this outfit.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.876
If deconstructed fashion
was the theme at the Met,

39:38.876 --> 39:40.879
this would be
a wonderful thing to wear.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.589
You look really chic
and sophisticated.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.716
I love that
you don't have hair on.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.259
It almost looks like a bun,
which is really, really cool.

39:46.259 --> 39:48.553
- Listen, I don't get it.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.762
I don't think
that it necessarily fits

39:49.762 --> 39:52.181
with the swerves and curves
and pads.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.933
To me, it doesn't quite work.

39:53.933 --> 39:58.146
- Your acting challenge,
I was a little nervous for you.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.732
But I thought your acting chops
have really been refined.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.191
So whatever you're doing,
keep doing it.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.360
- I really enjoyed you,

40:04.360 --> 40:06.946
and I want you to keep
letting yourself go like that.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.240
Allowing yourself
to be in the moment,

40:09.240 --> 40:11.492
not worrying about being pretty.
Maybe that's why.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.911
Because you looked a mess,
so you were able to be a mess.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.330
- Thank you.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.456
- Moo-nique Heart.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.750
[all laugh]
- Moo-nique.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.753
- Tonight on the runway,
I mean, it's pure comedy.

40:21.753 --> 40:25.757
You are showing us
your curves as insane

40:25.757 --> 40:28.926
and in places that I'd never
thought curves occurred.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.762
- I've spent a lot of time
around dairy cattle.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.388
Don't ask.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.724
But even like the cows' hips
are like that.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.476
They're like very pointy
and bony

40:36.476 --> 40:38.519
and wider than
the rest of their bodies.

40:38.519 --> 40:39.520
I had a cow over this
when you came out.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.064
[Michelle chuckles]

40:41.064 --> 40:45.068
- I want to talk about your
performance as Anastasia.

40:45.068 --> 40:47.904
The voice is a bit shrill
and doing my head in.

40:47.904 --> 40:50.281
But it was perfect
for the character.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.617
I absolutely loved it.

40:52.617 --> 40:56.621
You were so in it
every second of the way.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.456
- It almost scared me
how much you were in it.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.958
When there was a cake thrown in
your face, you were still in it.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.461
I didn't see you break once.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.297
- I enjoy
the understated character,

41:06.297 --> 41:08.466
and I enjoy
the overstated character,

41:08.466 --> 41:11.344
as long as either one
is not done horribly.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.471
And I think you did yours
very beautifully.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.765
I loved the "I objectify."

41:15.765 --> 41:17.767
Really well done.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.520
- Thank you.
- Latrice Royale.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.814
- This is your goddamn
category.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.607
This is yours, swerves
and curves all the way.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.693
- I do want to commend you

41:26.693 --> 41:28.111
on how beautiful you look
on the runway tonight.

41:28.111 --> 41:29.404
- I cinched
for the very first time.

41:29.404 --> 41:30.697
- Oh, bitch, I can see it.

41:30.697 --> 41:31.864
Do you not usually cinch?
- Never.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.157
- Ever?
- Ever.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.409
- It's not fun.

41:34.409 --> 41:37.161
- No, it's not, but I'm hooked.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.705
You couldn't tell me
I wasn't fine, baby.

41:38.705 --> 41:40.540
- In the courtroom, Anna Mae.

41:40.540 --> 41:43.000
Anna Mae was kind of gone
for me, Latrice.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.293
- She was not there?

41:44.293 --> 41:47.213
- Going up against
the powerhouse that is Monique,

41:47.213 --> 41:48.965
you had to match her.

41:48.965 --> 41:51.676
And you didn't have to do it
loud and crazy like she was,

41:51.676 --> 41:53.511
but you were this proper woman.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.638
You could have gone
all the way that way.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.223
The minute you think
you've given too much,

41:57.223 --> 41:59.434
we're still gonna ask for more.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.561
We are greedy-ass bottoms.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.020
[Carson laughs]

42:03.020 --> 42:06.190
- And that takes us
to Carson Kressley.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.485
- Anna Mae, yeah,
I think we needed Anna More.

42:09.485 --> 42:10.778
You're all All Stars.

42:10.778 --> 42:12.739
Everyone is at
the top of their game.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.699
We need you to pop
in those scenes,

42:14.699 --> 42:16.784
so amp it up.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.995
- Up next, Monet X Change.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.621
- I love the surprise
on the runway.

42:20.621 --> 42:24.083
So when you first emerged,
it was just like a black gown,

42:24.083 --> 42:25.501
with the champagne bottle,
the pearl necklace.

42:25.501 --> 42:26.878
And we're just like, okay.

42:26.878 --> 42:30.965
And then you turn around
and pop that.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.467
That was really fun.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.886
- This is an image
that is overdone

42:34.886 --> 42:38.639
until the cows come home.
Sorry, Monique.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.476
But the way you did it
on the runway was fun,

42:41.476 --> 42:42.643
because you brought it to life.

42:42.643 --> 42:44.604
- When you first
walked into the challenge,

42:44.604 --> 42:46.189
you were at a bit
of a disadvantage,

42:46.189 --> 42:48.649
because you come in a little bit
later than everybody else.

42:48.649 --> 42:51.819
So they've gotten all the good
stuff before you get there.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.905
That for me made it very tough

42:53.905 --> 42:55.990
to get involved
in your character.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.950
You have to be
a little bit more creative.

42:57.950 --> 42:59.994
- Yeah, there were
a lot of great moments.

42:59.994 --> 43:03.372
I just feel like I didn't
maybe know who you were.

43:03.372 --> 43:07.001
- What I felt like I was seeing
was Monet in a blonde wig.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.921
I didn't feel a character
development really at all.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.047
And I felt like you guys

43:11.047 --> 43:13.716
basically handed the scene
over to Monique.

43:15.134 --> 43:19.472
- Now, based on
the judges' critiques,

43:19.472 --> 43:21.182
I've made some decisions.

43:23.226 --> 43:24.143
- Monique Heart.

43:25.645 --> 43:26.979
Manila Luzon.

43:29.106 --> 43:31.317
You're the top two
All Stars of the week.

43:31.317 --> 43:35.279
[applause]

43:35.279 --> 43:37.323
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

43:37.323 --> 43:40.493
You've each won
a $2.500 gift card

43:40.493 --> 43:43.371
from FierceQueen.com,

43:43.371 --> 43:50.002
and a $2.000 gift card
from Eleas Closet.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.254
- Jewels.

43:51.254 --> 43:53.464
- Trinity The Tuck,

43:53.464 --> 43:56.259
Naomi Smalls,

43:56.259 --> 43:57.885
Valentina.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.642
You are all safe.

44:08.771 --> 44:14.735
Which means Latrice Royale
and Monet X Change,

44:14.735 --> 44:16.320
you are in the bottom two.

44:18.781 --> 44:23.494
Monique and Manila,
each of you needs to decide

44:23.494 --> 44:26.789
which of the bottom two
you'll eliminate

44:26.789 --> 44:28.624
if you win the lip sync.

44:30.334 --> 44:33.671
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

44:33.671 --> 44:36.340
the judges and I will be making

44:36.340 --> 44:40.845
autonomous sensory
meridian response videos.

44:40.845 --> 44:43.139
[slurps]

44:43.139 --> 44:45.600
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.

44:47.393 --> 44:50.354
- ♪ Ooh, child ♪

44:50.354 --> 44:53.107
♪ Things might need a cocktail ♪

44:53.107 --> 44:55.818
Going into deliberation,
I'm conflicted.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.528
My Jersey girl was good.

44:57.528 --> 45:00.448
My swerves and curves runway,
you can't come for.

45:00.448 --> 45:01.782
And I won.

45:01.782 --> 45:06.120
But these are my two teammates
in the bottom two.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.122
I have to send one of them.

45:08.122 --> 45:09.373
America, I'm gooped.

45:09.373 --> 45:11.709
- [cries]

45:11.709 --> 45:14.003
- I hate this.
- Girl.

45:14.003 --> 45:17.882
- It's like what do you do?
This is horrible.

45:17.882 --> 45:21.510
- I know
we all sacrificed a lot.

45:21.510 --> 45:24.764
I've given up so much
to be here.

45:24.764 --> 45:28.976
This is not my time.

45:28.976 --> 45:32.438
I've been doing this
for 25 years.

45:32.438 --> 45:38.194
But there's always been this,
like, unfulfilled prophecy,

45:38.194 --> 45:43.491
and all I wanted to do when I
came back here was get my crown.

45:43.491 --> 45:44.742
- And that's why
it's so heartbreaking

45:44.742 --> 45:46.285
that you're here
in this position.

45:46.285 --> 45:48.204
I love you, Latrice.

45:48.204 --> 45:50.164
- I love you, too, honey.

45:50.164 --> 45:52.833
- Latrice has had
an amazing career.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.085
She has.

45:54.085 --> 45:56.671
But this competition
is not about

45:56.671 --> 46:00.132
how many years you've been
in the business, girl.

46:00.132 --> 46:03.427
You have not been up to par
the entire time we've been here,

46:03.427 --> 46:04.679
and tonight you were the worst.

46:04.679 --> 46:06.347
Goodbye.

46:06.347 --> 46:08.724
- It sucks to be here
with someone like Latrice,

46:08.724 --> 46:10.851
who we all love
and know and respect,

46:10.851 --> 46:12.353
because I feel like Latrice
and I are both talented

46:12.353 --> 46:13.729
and we're both two people

46:13.729 --> 46:17.358
who have been trying our
damnedest in this competition.

46:17.358 --> 46:19.986
But I feel like
it's not my time to go.

46:19.986 --> 46:22.697
- Ladies, I'm boiling.

46:22.697 --> 46:25.157
My blood is simmering
through my veins,

46:25.157 --> 46:26.867
and I have
some things to say, okay?

46:28.202 --> 46:31.872
I am deeply
and utterly offended.

46:31.872 --> 46:35.042
That judge
with a bun and the gold,

46:35.042 --> 46:37.878
I do not appreciate her
non-constructive criticism

46:37.878 --> 46:40.047
of my beautiful outfit.

46:41.716 --> 46:44.468
- Sis, I love you,
but you're safe.

46:44.468 --> 46:47.763
- I was phenomenal.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.098
No matter what anybody says,

46:49.098 --> 46:52.560
in my mind, in my world,
in my fantasy, I won.

46:52.560 --> 46:55.312
- Monique, I'm not ready to go.

46:55.312 --> 46:58.524
I feel like I'm on
the right path to doing stuff,

46:58.524 --> 46:59.734
and this was a misstep.

46:59.734 --> 47:02.111
- Monet, it is--I hate this.

47:02.111 --> 47:04.280
And I mean,
I hate that it's Latrice.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.449
I feel like if it was anybody
else, it would be so easy.

47:06.449 --> 47:09.452
I love both of y'all so much.

47:09.452 --> 47:12.705
Just to be in this place, girl.

47:12.705 --> 47:14.957
- I have
a pretty decent track record

47:14.957 --> 47:16.208
in this competition, you know.

47:16.208 --> 47:17.710
- I mean, I don't know.
It's kind of hard.

47:17.710 --> 47:19.670
Because you were in the top
one week,

47:19.670 --> 47:22.214
and you were in the bottom.

47:22.214 --> 47:25.384
And then with Latrice,
both weeks back to back,

47:25.384 --> 47:28.345
have been challenges
where she wasn't horrible.

47:28.345 --> 47:30.097
- Yeah.
- But she just didn't shine.

47:30.097 --> 47:31.932
- It's tough.

47:31.932 --> 47:33.100
I know it's a hard decision,

47:33.100 --> 47:34.852
but I feel like I'm
fucking working hard

47:34.852 --> 47:36.604
in this goddamn competition.

47:36.604 --> 47:39.106
And you, someone from day one,
say you're playing a fair game.

47:39.106 --> 47:40.441
- That is true.

47:40.441 --> 47:44.445
- [sobs]

47:44.445 --> 47:46.864
Latrice, you're such
a dear friend to me.

47:46.864 --> 47:49.700
You're, like, one of my best
friends in the whole world.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.911
I got you, all right?

47:51.911 --> 47:54.705
I'm going to tear
the fucking roof off this place

47:54.705 --> 47:56.999
to save my friend.

48:01.754 --> 48:06.008
- Latrice didn't quite hit
the mark in this challenge,

48:06.008 --> 48:09.261
but I know that she
has so much more to give.

48:09.261 --> 48:11.222
And I want my friend
to be here with me.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.431
That's the kind of person I am.

48:12.431 --> 48:13.808
And if you know me long enough,

48:13.808 --> 48:16.435
you'll know that I got
your back no matter what.

48:16.435 --> 48:19.647
I love you, Latrice, so much.

48:19.647 --> 48:23.109
Let's show these bitches
how we do it, okay?

48:23.109 --> 48:24.652
- The OG was right.

48:24.652 --> 48:27.238
- The OGs, bitch.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.865
- I really love Latrice,

48:29.865 --> 48:31.784
but, girl, because you've
been doing drag for 100 years

48:31.784 --> 48:33.369
you think you deserve the crown?

48:33.369 --> 48:35.204
That ain't cute to me,
because guess what?

48:35.204 --> 48:38.040
I see Manila.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.543
If she wins, she's gonna
pick Latrice to stay

48:40.543 --> 48:42.169
because they're friends.

48:42.169 --> 48:45.422
I think Manila
is very calculated.

48:45.422 --> 48:50.219
Monet is obviously more
competition to her than Latrice,

48:50.219 --> 48:52.346
and coming into
this competition,

48:52.346 --> 48:55.307
you're not handed
a packet of rules.

48:55.307 --> 48:57.935
Of course not, girl.
It's called morals.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.604
It's called fairness.

49:00.604 --> 49:02.439
I'm not playing
that shady shit here.

49:04.817 --> 49:06.235
- Manila Luzon.

49:06.235 --> 49:08.404
- Monet.

49:08.404 --> 49:09.572
[pblblblblbl]

49:09.572 --> 49:13.033
- [laughs]

49:13.033 --> 49:14.660
- Did that come from my breast?

49:14.660 --> 49:15.911
- Your breastplate farted.

49:15.911 --> 49:17.163
- Oh, my God.
- Girl.

49:17.163 --> 49:19.999
I first want to say,

49:19.999 --> 49:22.459
I just feel like my work
at "All Stars" is not done.

49:22.459 --> 49:25.462
I want to be a Manila Luzon.

49:25.462 --> 49:26.755
I want to be a Latrice Royale.

49:26.755 --> 49:28.215
I want to be a Raven.
I want to be a Raja.

49:28.215 --> 49:30.801
I want to be
that "Drag Race" girl

49:30.801 --> 49:32.761
that people seasons later

49:32.761 --> 49:33.804
will be like, oh,
Monet X Change.

49:33.804 --> 49:35.055
You know what I mean?

49:35.055 --> 49:37.016
- I'm very impressed by you.

49:37.016 --> 49:41.645
You're amazing for showing
how far you've come

49:41.645 --> 49:42.980
in just such a short time.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.816
And it sucks because
I want to see more from you.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.985
- Yeah.
- But it's like...

49:47.985 --> 49:50.279
- I know.
- It sucks.

49:50.279 --> 49:52.364
You've done well
in this competition,

49:52.364 --> 49:54.658
and you should be praised
for that.

49:56.243 --> 49:58.204
- Manila is Latrice's
best friend here,

49:58.204 --> 50:00.331
so it's like if she wants
to save her friend,

50:00.331 --> 50:02.875
like, she is well
in her right to do so.

50:02.875 --> 50:05.628
Ain't no rules that you have
to make a decision based on.

50:05.628 --> 50:08.172
But bitch, the bottom line
is that it is shady

50:08.172 --> 50:09.215
if I go home today.

50:11.091 --> 50:12.551
- The reason that this sucks

50:12.551 --> 50:14.678
is because you are
who you are to me,

50:14.678 --> 50:17.848
and who you are to so many other
young, black, gay men,

50:17.848 --> 50:20.142
and then just to
the community as a whole.

50:20.142 --> 50:21.477
So it is--

50:21.477 --> 50:22.728
- Well, I'm going to tell
you this.

50:22.728 --> 50:26.732
I'm going to tell you this
with every fiber of my being.

50:26.732 --> 50:29.693
I guarantee you,

50:29.693 --> 50:34.531
you keep me, I'm not
gonna be back here next week.

50:34.531 --> 50:36.867
This is an awful feeling.

50:36.867 --> 50:39.495
This is against everything
I'm here for.

50:39.495 --> 50:41.497
And the fact of the matter is

50:41.497 --> 50:43.916
there's no other place
that I would rather be

50:43.916 --> 50:45.709
right now than here.

50:45.709 --> 50:47.044
And that's saying a lot,

50:47.044 --> 50:48.587
considering that I have
a wedding to get planned--

50:48.587 --> 50:49.588
- To be getting to.

50:49.588 --> 50:51.006
- You understand
what I'm saying?

50:51.006 --> 50:53.008
- This is a whole lot, girl.

50:53.008 --> 50:55.010
- Baby, this is not hard.

50:55.010 --> 50:58.806
I am the most respected,
beloved queen in the game.

50:58.806 --> 51:02.476
That's who deserves and should
be in the competition.

51:02.476 --> 51:05.229
- Just let me go
and get my mind right.

51:05.229 --> 51:07.314
And I love you.
- I love you, too.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.566
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

51:09.566 --> 51:15.656
- [whispering] I want us
to do some ASMR triggers

51:15.656 --> 51:18.742
to help us relax.

51:18.742 --> 51:20.577
- [whispering] I'm going to use
my sharp talons

51:20.577 --> 51:24.373
to gently caress
this fierce, daftboy fan.

51:24.373 --> 51:25.624
[scratch]

51:25.624 --> 51:27.751
[crunch]

51:27.751 --> 51:30.504
[pop, can opens]

51:30.504 --> 51:32.589
[all sounds]

51:32.589 --> 51:33.716
- Silence.

51:33.716 --> 51:37.011
Bring back my...

51:37.011 --> 51:38.804
All Stars.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.014
[pop-top can opens]

51:40.014 --> 51:41.348
[gong]

51:48.105 --> 51:50.190
- After all these years,
I'm still Team Latrila.

51:51.984 --> 51:55.654
So it's no secret
that I will save Latrice.

51:55.654 --> 51:58.824
She hasn't been able to shine

51:58.824 --> 52:03.037
and really show
everything she's got.

52:03.037 --> 52:04.371
I don't think that
she's going to get that chance

52:04.371 --> 52:06.707
unless I'm able to save her.

52:08.917 --> 52:10.711
- I don't know what to do.

52:10.711 --> 52:11.879
I love them both,

52:11.879 --> 52:13.756
and I'm really torn.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.552
Do I keep the person that's
been an inspiration to me,

52:18.552 --> 52:23.932
even though her report card
is just Cs?

52:23.932 --> 52:26.477
Or do I give the person

52:26.477 --> 52:28.604
a second chance
to redeem themselves

52:28.604 --> 52:30.397
from an off week

52:30.397 --> 52:33.609
who has had at least one A+?

52:33.609 --> 52:36.236
Reality is the world's
going to be gagged.

52:38.697 --> 52:41.116
Am I making the right decision?

52:46.872 --> 52:48.499
- Welcome back, ladies.

52:48.499 --> 52:50.918
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.961
Prior to tonight,

52:52.961 --> 52:56.548
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

52:56.548 --> 53:00.636
of the Elton John classic,
"The Bitch Is Back,"

53:00.636 --> 53:04.223
performed by Tina Turner.

53:04.223 --> 53:06.934
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

53:06.934 --> 53:10.104
win $10.000,

53:10.104 --> 53:11.730
and earn the power

53:11.730 --> 53:15.401
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

53:17.694 --> 53:19.905
The time has come...
[thunder]

53:19.905 --> 53:21.782
for you to lip sync...

53:21.782 --> 53:25.702
[echoing] for your legacy.

53:25.702 --> 53:30.541
And as Sir Elton John
always says...

53:30.541 --> 53:32.251
- Good luck.
- [gasps]

53:32.251 --> 53:34.711
- And don't fuck it up.

53:34.711 --> 53:36.839
- Yes!

53:36.839 --> 53:39.383
Oh, message.
[applause]

53:39.383 --> 53:41.969

[cheers and applause]

55:46.093 --> 55:47.761
- Whoo!

55:50.389 --> 55:53.934
- Ladies, I've made my decision.

55:58.564 --> 56:00.357
- Monique Heart.

56:01.858 --> 56:03.235
You're a winner, baby.

56:03.235 --> 56:06.196
[applause]

56:06.196 --> 56:09.992
- This is my first time actually
winning my lip sync, ever.

56:09.992 --> 56:11.493
Praise the Lord, America.

56:11.493 --> 56:14.746
I win $10.000.

56:14.746 --> 56:16.290
You know what I can do
with a 10 stack?

56:16.290 --> 56:19.042
But first
I have to send someone home,

56:19.042 --> 56:20.711
and that sucks.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.546
- Con-drag-ulations.

56:22.546 --> 56:26.258
You've earned a cash tip
of $10.000.

56:26.258 --> 56:29.136
[applause]

56:29.136 --> 56:31.096
- Manila, you're safe.

56:31.096 --> 56:31.972
You may join the other girls.

56:38.645 --> 56:41.398
- [cries]

56:46.069 --> 56:49.406
- Now will the bottom two
please step forward.

56:57.247 --> 57:01.585
Monique, with great power
comes great responsibility.

57:03.003 --> 57:06.965
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

57:09.051 --> 57:12.054
- This moment
is beautiful and joyous,

57:12.054 --> 57:15.182
because it's my first lip sync
redeeming myself.

57:15.182 --> 57:18.810
However, I love these two.

57:18.810 --> 57:21.647
This is horrible.

57:23.231 --> 57:25.734
The person I chose,

57:25.734 --> 57:29.613
they are sickening,
they are stunning,

57:29.613 --> 57:32.824
they really do give you
the ooh-ah-ah sensation.

57:34.951 --> 57:36.662
They just won't be doing it
here with us.

57:38.705 --> 57:40.040
I chose Latrice.

57:44.503 --> 57:46.672
- [sobs]

57:52.344 --> 57:54.054
- Latrice Royale,

57:54.054 --> 57:58.809
as it is written,
so it shall be done.

57:58.809 --> 58:04.940
You are and will always be
an All Star.

58:04.940 --> 58:09.695
Now sashay away.

58:09.695 --> 58:11.697
- Thank you all.

58:11.697 --> 58:15.701
[applause]

58:18.829 --> 58:21.206
- I love you.
- Love you all.

58:21.206 --> 58:23.083
Kill it.

58:23.083 --> 58:25.585
Love you.

58:25.585 --> 58:27.337
- Love you, bitch.
- Me, too, baby.

58:27.337 --> 58:29.005
- I love you.

58:29.005 --> 58:31.758
- Always large and in charge.

58:31.758 --> 58:33.385
Chunky get funky.

58:33.385 --> 58:36.471
Bold and beautiful, and this
is not the end of me, darling.

58:36.471 --> 58:39.474
[cheers and applause]

58:41.977 --> 58:43.937
- Anybody could have been
in the bottom.

58:43.937 --> 58:46.356
It just so happened
it was me and Monet.

58:46.356 --> 58:48.525
I get it.
I understand it.

58:48.525 --> 58:51.319
Did I come out here and do
what I intended to do? No.

58:51.319 --> 58:54.072
Will I wake up tomorrow
and still be fabulous?

58:54.072 --> 58:55.323
Absolutely.

58:55.323 --> 58:59.035
So...oh, well.

58:59.035 --> 59:00.537
Everything happens for a reason.

59:00.537 --> 59:01.997
If this is not my destiny,

59:01.997 --> 59:03.039
then there's something
bigger and better

59:03.039 --> 59:04.082
out there waiting for me.

59:04.082 --> 59:05.667
Okay, yeah.

59:05.667 --> 59:08.003
No matter what, I'm still
Latrice motherfucking Royale,

59:08.003 --> 59:10.255
and nobody will ever
take that away from me.

59:15.427 --> 59:17.846
- Con-drag-ulations, All Stars.

59:17.846 --> 59:21.224
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:21.224 --> 59:22.976
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

59:22.976 --> 59:24.519
Can I get an amen up in here?

59:24.519 --> 59:25.896
- Amen.
- All right.

59:25.896 --> 59:27.522
Now let the music play.

59:27.522 --> 59:28.899

59:39.618 --> 59:42.120
We're celebrating
the life and times

59:42.120 --> 59:43.997
of the great Lady Bunny.

59:43.997 --> 59:46.458
May she roast in peace.

59:46.458 --> 59:49.127
[cheers and applause]
- Okay.

59:49.127 --> 59:51.129
- Look at that big bloated
bitch in that box.

59:51.129 --> 59:53.131
Have you ever seen her
out of drag?

59:53.131 --> 59:56.134
Category is Ben Franklin
fucks the Michelin Man, okay?

59:56.134 --> 59:58.386
- Doctors use a picture of her

59:58.386 --> 1:00:00.180
to solve Viagra users

1:00:00.180 --> 1:00:02.557
with erections lasting
longer than four hours.

1:00:02.557 --> 1:00:04.476
- That was the joke?

1:00:04.476 --> 1:00:05.727
- If it was up to Torshi,

1:00:05.727 --> 1:00:07.270
the judges
could decide who goes home.

1:00:07.270 --> 1:00:09.773
- That's a little nerve-wracking
because no one really knows

1:00:09.773 --> 1:00:10.565
where they're going to stand
with you.

1:00:10.565 --> 1:00:12.484
- Very that.

1:00:12.484 --> 1:00:14.444
- For the first time
in "Drag Race" herstory,

1:00:14.444 --> 1:00:17.781
"All Star" rules

1:00:17.781 --> 1:00:18.990
are suspended.

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:23.411
- I have died and gone to hell.

1:00:23.411 --> 1:00:25.205
