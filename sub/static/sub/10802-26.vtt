WEBVTT

00:03.447 --> 00:06.564
But then I said,
"In that frame of reference,

00:06.647 --> 00:11.277
Mercury's perihelion would have
precessed in the opposite direction!"

00:13.967 --> 00:15.923
A great story!

00:16.007 --> 00:17.918
Quite amusing, Dr Hawking.

00:18.007 --> 00:19.804
Sir Isaac, the joke depends

00:19.887 --> 00:23.243
on an understanding
of the curvature of space-time.

00:23.327 --> 00:26.399
If two non-inertial reference
frames are...

00:26.487 --> 00:30.162
Do not patronize me, sir.
I invented physics.

00:30.687 --> 00:35.397
The day the apple fell on my head was
the most momentous day in science.

00:35.487 --> 00:37.842
Not the apple story again!

00:37.927 --> 00:40.316
That story is considered apocryphal.

00:40.407 --> 00:43.399
What? How dare you!

00:43.487 --> 00:46.399
Perhaps we should get
on to the game?

00:46.487 --> 00:49.877
Now, where were we?
Yes, you raised Mr. Data four.

00:49.967 --> 00:54.438
Which means that
the bet is seven to me?

00:54.527 --> 00:59.237
The bet is ten!
Can't you do simple arithmetic?

01:01.447 --> 01:04.280
I don't know why I'm here in
the first place.

01:04.367 --> 01:06.642
What is the point
of this ridiculous game?

01:06.727 --> 01:08.763
When I play poker with my shipmates,

01:08.847 --> 01:13.398
it is a useful forum for exploring
the different facets of humanity.

01:13.487 --> 01:14.886
I was curious to see

01:14.967 --> 01:19.006
how three of history's greatest minds
would interact.

01:19.087 --> 01:23.160
So far, it has proved
to be most illuminating.

01:23.527 --> 01:25.438
And profitable!

01:26.007 --> 01:28.726
Can we get this over with, please?

01:28.807 --> 01:30.365
It's your bet.

01:31.247 --> 01:34.683
- I raise 50.
- Blast! I fold.

01:36.127 --> 01:37.560
I fold as well.

01:38.007 --> 01:41.716
The uncertainty principle
will not help you now, Stephen.

01:41.807 --> 01:46.358
All the quantum fluctuations in the
universe will not change your cards.

01:46.847 --> 01:51.159
I call. You are bluffing,
and you will lose.

01:51.447 --> 01:53.677
Wrong again, Albert.

01:56.727 --> 01:58.319
Well...

02:00.847 --> 02:03.919
Red alert.
All personnel to duty stations.

02:04.007 --> 02:07.795
We will have to continue this
another time.

02:07.887 --> 02:09.877
End program.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.647 --> 02:23.320
We received a call
from the Ohniaka III outpost.

02:23.407 --> 02:25.318
They said they were under attack.

02:25.407 --> 02:29.161
Ohniaka III?
It has no strategic value.

02:29.247 --> 02:33.081
- Did they identify the attackers?
- No, and we've lost contact.

02:33.167 --> 02:37.558
- We are entering the Ohniaka system.
- Bring us out of warp, Ensign.

02:37.647 --> 02:40.286
There is one ship
orbiting the third planet.

02:40.727 --> 02:45.278
- Its configuration is unknown.
- Stand by phasers and torpedoes.

02:45.687 --> 02:49.123
- Hail them, Mr. Worf.
- No response, sir.

02:49.767 --> 02:51.485
Put them on screen.

02:53.647 --> 02:57.720
- It is not attacking the outpost.
- They might have attacked already.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.801
Or they might simply be
another victim.

03:01.727 --> 03:03.558
What about the outpost?

03:03.647 --> 03:06.525
There was a lot of
electromagnetic interference.

03:06.607 --> 03:09.360
I do not know if there are
any life forms present.

03:10.807 --> 03:12.923
Worf, Data, you're with me.

03:33.327 --> 03:38.685
These wounds were caused by a plasma
beam, similar to a Ferengi phaser.

03:38.767 --> 03:41.998
It's brutal even for the Ferengi.
Any sign of the survivors?

03:42.087 --> 03:46.160
Electromagnetic interference
is still making a reading difficult.

03:46.247 --> 03:50.035
- How many people worked here?
- 27 4.

03:50.127 --> 03:51.640
We need to do a search.

03:51.727 --> 03:56.118
Worf and Corelki, north wing.
You and I will take the south.

04:06.167 --> 04:08.681
The mechanism
appears to be jammed, sir.

04:10.647 --> 04:11.921
Not much damage.

04:12.007 --> 04:15.238
They weren't interested
in the station, just the people.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.877
I have bypassed the primary system.

04:50.447 --> 04:53.757
Space, the final frontier.

04:54.967 --> 04:58.801
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

04:58.887 --> 05:03.085
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

05:04.127 --> 05:07.517
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

05:08.527 --> 05:12.315
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

06:25.247 --> 06:27.920
Evasive manoeuvres, Ensign.
Return fire.

06:29.847 --> 06:33.681
Shields down to 80 percent.
Compensating with auxiliary power.

06:47.007 --> 06:50.602
You have killed Torsus.
I will make you suffer for this.

06:54.767 --> 06:57.520
Biological organism, Klingon.

06:58.327 --> 07:00.158
Biological organism, human.

07:17.327 --> 07:18.919
Stop it.

07:19.407 --> 07:20.806
Stop!

07:36.007 --> 07:38.043
Artificial life form.

07:38.127 --> 07:41.199
Starfleet rank, lieutenant commander.

07:41.287 --> 07:43.517
Name, Data.

07:55.407 --> 07:59.366
- The alien ship is breaking orbit.
- Intercept course. Fire torpedoes.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.725
They're gone, sir.

08:08.807 --> 08:13.483
There was some kind of subspace
distortion before they disappeared.

08:13.567 --> 08:18.004
I'll have to study these readings
before I can get any more specific.

08:20.007 --> 08:23.044
- Take us back to Ohniaka III.
- Aye, sir.

08:31.407 --> 08:32.999
Data?

08:33.727 --> 08:35.717
Data, are you alright?

08:36.567 --> 08:39.034
- Yes, sir.
- What happened?

08:44.567 --> 08:46.558
I got angry.

08:50.247 --> 08:53.444
Captain's log, stardate 46982. 1.

08:53.527 --> 08:56.963
Because of his unusual behaviour
on the planet's surface,

08:57.047 --> 09:00.722
Cmdr Data has asked to be
temporarily relieved of duty.

09:00.807 --> 09:04.038
Unfortunately, he will not
be able to help investigate

09:04.127 --> 09:07.802
a disturbing new change
in the behaviour of the Borg.

09:08.087 --> 09:11.397
They were fast, aggressive,
almost vicious.

09:11.487 --> 09:15.082
It was more like fighting
Klingons than Borg. No offence.

09:15.607 --> 09:17.484
None taken.

09:17.567 --> 09:20.798
I don't believe they were part
of the Borg collective.

09:21.407 --> 09:24.001
- They were acting as individuals.
- What?!

09:24.607 --> 09:26.757
One of them
referred to himself as "l".

09:26.847 --> 09:31.967
And he showed concern for a comrade.
He even called him by name.

09:32.047 --> 09:36.404
The only Borg who had a name
was Hugh. And we gave it to him.

09:37.527 --> 09:41.520
Maybe Hugh has something to do
with this change in their behaviour.

09:41.607 --> 09:45.805
Did they show any interest in
assimilating you or your technology?

09:45.887 --> 09:49.482
They were concerned with
their dead colleague and killing us.

09:49.567 --> 09:53.003
Nothing suggested
they wanted to assimilate anybody.

09:53.087 --> 09:59.083
The Borg's existence centred around
acquiring cultures and technology.

10:00.447 --> 10:03.883
If that's changed,
then they must have a new objective.

10:05.287 --> 10:07.084
We have to find out what it is.

10:07.167 --> 10:11.524
Mr. Worf, from now on I want to
maintain a level-two security alert.

10:11.607 --> 10:14.201
- Post armed officers on all decks.
- Aye, sir.

10:14.287 --> 10:18.075
Number One, analyze our sensor
readings of the Borg ship.

10:18.167 --> 10:21.159
Try to determine
if it was something they constructed

10:21.247 --> 10:23.477
or an alien ship that they captured,

10:23.567 --> 10:27.799
then run an analysis of this subspace
distortion they used to escape.

10:27.887 --> 10:31.038
- Aye, sir.
- I'll contact Starfleet Command.

10:35.487 --> 10:39.275
Well, the positronic net checks out.

10:40.367 --> 10:42.323
Everything else looks fine.

10:42.407 --> 10:45.319
My internal diagnostic
also finds nothing wrong.

10:45.407 --> 10:50.845
Nothing here indicates anything that
might cause any behavioural anomaly.

10:50.927 --> 10:52.918
I agree.

10:54.647 --> 10:59.437
Geordi, I believe I have experienced
my first emotion.

11:02.527 --> 11:04.199
No offence, Data,

11:04.287 --> 11:08.326
but how would you know a flash of
anger from some kind of power surge?

11:09.847 --> 11:14.079
You are correct in that I have no
frame of reference for my hypothesis.

11:14.167 --> 11:18.160
In fact, I am unable to give a verbal
description of the experience.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.799
Perhaps you could describe
how it feels to be angry.

11:22.887 --> 11:25.401
I could then use that as a reference.

11:25.487 --> 11:27.205
Yeah, OK.

11:27.287 --> 11:32.042
Well, when I feel angry, first I...

11:33.487 --> 11:35.478
First, I feel...

11:36.607 --> 11:38.325
..hostile.

11:38.407 --> 11:40.796
Could you describe feeling hostile?

11:41.887 --> 11:47.200
Yeah, it's like feeling
belligerent, combative.

11:47.687 --> 11:52.158
Could you describe feeling angry
without referring to other feelings?

11:54.687 --> 11:57.440
No, I guess I can't.

11:57.847 --> 12:01.476
I just feel angry.

12:01.567 --> 12:07.164
That was my experience as well.
I simply felt angry.

12:09.567 --> 12:13.321
Well, let's say you're right
and this is a real emotion.

12:13.407 --> 12:15.398
How is that possible?

12:15.927 --> 12:17.918
I do not know.

12:18.487 --> 12:22.878
Perhaps I have evolved to the point
where emotions are within my grasp.

12:23.527 --> 12:26.678
Perhaps I will have other emotions
as time goes by.

12:27.087 --> 12:28.884
Well, I hope you're right.

12:28.967 --> 12:32.755
I'd hate to think that anger
is all you're capable of feeling.

12:35.287 --> 12:38.359
Captain's log, stardate 46984.6.

12:38.447 --> 12:42.360
No additional Borg attacks have
been reported in the past two days.

12:42.447 --> 12:47.077
However Starfleet has despatched
Admiral Necheyev to this sector

12:47.167 --> 12:50.477
in preparation for
a possible Borg invasion.

12:50.567 --> 12:54.480
There will be 15 starships in this
sector by the day after tomorrow.

12:54.567 --> 12:58.242
The Gorkon will be my flagship.
You will command Task Force Three.

12:58.327 --> 13:01.478
This ship, the Crazy Horse
and the Agamemnon.

13:01.567 --> 13:03.364
Understood.

13:03.447 --> 13:08.123
Captain, I've read the report you
submitted to Admiral Brooks last year

13:08.207 --> 13:10.243
regarding the Borg you called Hugh.

13:10.327 --> 13:12.716
I've tried to figure out
why you let him go.

13:14.887 --> 13:18.197
I thought that I had made that clear.

13:18.287 --> 13:22.166
As I understand it, you found
a single Borg at a crash site,

13:22.247 --> 13:26.604
brought it aboard the Enterprise,
studied it, analyzed it,

13:26.687 --> 13:29.804
and eventually found a way
to send it back to the Borg

13:29.887 --> 13:33.323
with a program that would have
destroyed the collective.

13:34.327 --> 13:38.798
But instead you nursed the Borg back
to health, treated it like a guest,

13:38.887 --> 13:42.402
gave it a name and sent it home. Why?

13:43.687 --> 13:47.680
When Hugh was separated from
the Borg collective he began to grow,

13:47.767 --> 13:51.362
to evolve into something
other than an automaton.

13:51.447 --> 13:53.642
He became a person.

13:53.727 --> 13:55.445
When that happened,

13:55.527 --> 13:59.236
I felt I had no choice but to
respect his rights as an individual.

13:59.327 --> 14:00.840
You had a choice.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.885
You could have rid the Federation
of a mortal enemy,

14:04.007 --> 14:08.159
one that has killed tens of thousands
of innocent people and may kill more.

14:08.727 --> 14:11.719
No one is more aware of the danger
than I am.

14:12.927 --> 14:16.681
But I am also bound
by my oath and my conscience

14:16.767 --> 14:19.281
to uphold certain principles.

14:20.167 --> 14:21.725
I will not sacrifice them...

14:21.807 --> 14:24.401
Your priority
is to protect our citizens,

14:24.487 --> 14:26.796
not to wrestle with your conscience.

14:27.327 --> 14:31.320
I want to make it clear that if you
have a similar opportunity in future,

14:31.407 --> 14:33.875
an opportunity to destroy the Borg,

14:33.967 --> 14:37.323
you are under orders
to take advantage of it.

14:37.407 --> 14:39.796
Is that understood?

14:42.687 --> 14:44.279
Yes, sir.

14:51.887 --> 14:53.764
For the past six hours,

14:53.847 --> 14:58.682
I have tried to produce an emotional
response by using various stimuli.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.280
Like what?

15:00.367 --> 15:03.359
I listened to several operas
known to be uplifting,

15:03.447 --> 15:06.962
I watched three holodeck programs
designed to be humorous,

15:07.047 --> 15:10.357
and I made four attempts
to induce sexual desire

15:10.447 --> 15:12.199
by using erotic imagery.

15:13.127 --> 15:15.516
- What happened?
- Nothing.

15:16.727 --> 15:18.319
I'm curious.

15:18.407 --> 15:22.082
Why are you ignoring the one emotion
you've already experienced?

15:22.167 --> 15:25.364
Why aren't you trying to
make yourself angry again?

15:26.047 --> 15:30.279
Anger is negative. I wanted to
concentrate on something positive.

15:30.967 --> 15:36.121
Data, feelings aren't positive
and negative, they simply exist.

15:36.687 --> 15:39.645
It's what we do with them
that becomes good or bad.

15:41.207 --> 15:45.723
For example,
feeling angry about an injustice

15:45.807 --> 15:49.277
could lead someone to take
a positive action to correct it.

15:50.527 --> 15:54.645
But my study of humanity indicates
that some emotions are harmful,

15:54.727 --> 15:57.082
such as jealousy or hatred.

15:57.847 --> 15:59.724
Those are very strong emotions

15:59.807 --> 16:03.561
and you're right,
very little good can come from them.

16:03.647 --> 16:07.083
But I don't think that
an exploration of anger

16:07.167 --> 16:10.921
need necessarily lead to
hatred or malice.

16:11.367 --> 16:13.562
But what if it does, Counsellor?

16:13.647 --> 16:17.720
What if those are the only emotions
I am capable of experiencing?

16:17.807 --> 16:20.002
Would that not make me a bad person?

16:27.807 --> 16:33.165
We've served together a long time.
I've come to know you pretty well.

16:34.007 --> 16:38.319
I have to believe if you ever
reach your goal of becoming human,

16:39.047 --> 16:40.924
you won't become a bad one.

16:43.447 --> 16:46.280
I wish I were as confident as you,
Counsellor.

16:47.927 --> 16:51.237
When I was fighting the Borg,
I felt angry.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.756
But when I think back
on the incident,

16:56.367 --> 17:00.565
I realize that I was
also experiencing another sensation.

17:01.647 --> 17:05.878
It was not the same as anger.
But I think it was an emotion.

17:07.247 --> 17:09.807
When exactly did you feel
this other emotion?

17:11.727 --> 17:14.116
It was just after
I had killed the Borg.

17:15.287 --> 17:17.278
I looked down at his body.

17:20.367 --> 17:22.005
I felt something.

17:24.166 --> 17:29.764
If you had to give this feeling
a name, what would you call it?

17:34.727 --> 17:38.402
I believe it was...

17:41.447 --> 17:42.846
..pleasure.

17:49.607 --> 17:53.725
Red alert! Battle stations.
Lay in a course. Engage warp nine.

17:55.487 --> 17:58.320
The New Berlin Colony
say they're under attack.

17:58.407 --> 18:01.319
- What's our ETA?
- 15 minutes, 30 seconds.

18:01.407 --> 18:04.285
Contact the Crazy Horse
and the Agamemnon.

18:04.367 --> 18:07.279
Incoming message
from the New Berlin colony.

18:07.367 --> 18:10.962
They have cancelled
their distress call.

18:11.047 --> 18:14.835
A Ferengi trading ship entered
their system and they panicked.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.442
Third time today. Stand down!
Return to our patrol route.

18:18.527 --> 18:20.882
Mr. Worf,
acknowledge New Berlin's signal

18:20.967 --> 18:24.721
and send another copy of Starfleet's
ship-recognition protocols

18:24.807 --> 18:26.798
and tell them to read it this time!

18:26.887 --> 18:28.115
Aye, sir.

18:29.047 --> 18:32.642
Captain's log, supplemental.
We have been on patrol for 16 hours

18:32.727 --> 18:35.480
without any reports
of further Borg activity.

18:35.567 --> 18:39.958
But tensions continue to run high
on the colonies in this sector.

18:40.407 --> 18:43.001
- Do I have a name?
- I'm Beverly.

18:43.647 --> 18:46.400
He's Geordi, and you... you...

18:46.487 --> 18:50.366
No, wait a minute. That's it. Hugh!

18:51.047 --> 18:52.446
We are Hugh.

18:53.287 --> 18:54.959
Come.

18:57.087 --> 19:01.683
This is the analysis of the subspace
distortion the Borg used to escape.

19:01.767 --> 19:05.043
"An artificially created
energy conduit"?

19:05.607 --> 19:08.280
- That could be anything.
- We lack information.

19:08.367 --> 19:10.927
I don't want excuses, I want answers!

19:13.367 --> 19:15.358
I'm sorry.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.802
He was here in this room, Will.

19:21.727 --> 19:25.276
I could have rid the Federation
of a mortal threat and I let him go.

19:25.927 --> 19:31.843
Sending Hugh back to the Borg was
a very risky, very dangerous choice.

19:32.967 --> 19:34.923
But it was the moral thing to do.

19:35.767 --> 19:40.841
It may turn out that the moral thing
to do was not the right thing to do.

20:01.487 --> 20:03.523
Stop it. Stop.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.678
Data, am I interrupting?

20:17.967 --> 20:21.277
Yes, but it is alright.
Do you need me?

20:22.007 --> 20:24.840
I wanted to see
if you were ready to return to duty.

20:24.927 --> 20:27.999
I need help with an analysis
on the ship the Borg used.

20:28.487 --> 20:30.637
I believe I am able
to resume my duties.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.763
Exactly what is it you're doing here?

20:34.647 --> 20:38.356
I am attempting to recreate the
experience which caused my anger.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.642
- Any luck?
- None so far.

20:42.167 --> 20:45.045
I have almost completed
this experiment.

20:45.127 --> 20:49.120
- May I finish before we go?
- Yeah, sure.

20:49.807 --> 20:53.800
Computer, reset Borg simulation
to time index 2.1 .

20:54.007 --> 20:56.885
Increase Borg strength
by 20 percent.

20:56.967 --> 20:58.605
Run program.

21:06.287 --> 21:08.323
Stop it. Stop.

21:15.847 --> 21:19.476
Computer,
reset simulation to time index 2.1 .

21:19.567 --> 21:22.001
Increase Borg strength by 30 percent.

21:22.087 --> 21:26.478
Unable to comply. A 30 percent
increase would exceed safety limits.

21:28.487 --> 21:32.719
The computer requires the voice
authorization of two senior officers

21:32.807 --> 21:35.605
in order to disable
the safety routine.

21:35.687 --> 21:39.919
- Will you help me?
- Wait. That thing could kill you.

21:40.847 --> 21:45.875
During the original incident,
the Borg posed a danger to my life.

21:45.967 --> 21:50.995
With the holodeck's safety routine
in place, I know there is no danger.

21:51.087 --> 21:55.365
Since I am trying to duplicate the
conditions of the original incident,

21:55.447 --> 21:58.564
I must also attempt
to duplicate my jeopardy as well.

21:59.047 --> 22:01.766
Data, we're talking about
an experiment here.

22:01.847 --> 22:04.964
You can't put your life on the line
to prove some theory!

22:06.687 --> 22:10.839
This experiment may hold the key to
something I have sought all my life.

22:16.127 --> 22:18.925
This is crazy!
There's got to be another way.

22:19.007 --> 22:22.158
Can't you think of some other way
to make yourself angry?

22:22.567 --> 22:26.242
I have tried other stimuli,
but they have been unsuccessful.

22:26.327 --> 22:28.397
I understand your objections,

22:28.487 --> 22:32.116
but it is my life and I have
a right to risk it if I choose.

22:32.207 --> 22:35.563
Yeah, and I'm your friend
and I'm not gonna let you do this.

22:35.647 --> 22:38.286
Red alert!
All hands, battle stations.

22:48.047 --> 22:50.607
Confirmed.
The MS 1 Colony is under attack.

22:50.687 --> 22:53.247
Isn't it strange
that in two Borg attacks,

22:53.327 --> 22:56.285
we have been the nearest ship
in both instances?

22:56.367 --> 22:59.677
Captain,
we are nearing the MS system.

23:00.047 --> 23:03.039
The Borg ship is
heading away from the colony.

23:03.127 --> 23:07.006
- Take us out of warp near that ship.
- Stand by to lock phasers on target.

23:07.087 --> 23:10.079
- Within visual range.
- On screen.

23:14.127 --> 23:17.358
Lay in an intercept course.
Lock phasers.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.599
We are closing.
Within phaser range in 30 seconds.

23:23.647 --> 23:28.243
Sensors are detecting a subspace
distortion ahead of the Borg ship.

23:28.327 --> 23:30.124
They won't get away this time.

23:30.207 --> 23:34.485
Engineering, transfer auxiliary and
emergency power to impulse engines.

23:34.567 --> 23:35.636
Acknowledged.

23:36.047 --> 23:40.484
- Impulse engines now at 125 percent.
- Within phaser range in ten seconds.

23:45.487 --> 23:48.047
We appear to be caught
in an energy matrix.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.800
- All engines back full.
- Shields failing.

23:50.887 --> 23:53.321
We are being pulled inside.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.486
Dampers failing.

24:05.567 --> 24:08.161
Main power off line.
I'm switching to backups.

24:08.247 --> 24:11.876
Picard to Engineering,
can we transfer auxiliary power?

24:11.967 --> 24:14.037
Try to break us out by using the...

24:15.087 --> 24:18.875
We have returned to normal space.
Navigational systems still off line.

24:18.967 --> 24:22.198
I will attempt a celestial fix
using secondary systems.

24:22.287 --> 24:27.042
Captain, the Borg ship is directly
ahead. It is coming about.

24:27.127 --> 24:30.483
- On screen.
- Shields down to 16 percent.

24:40.287 --> 24:41.686
Get down!

24:53.647 --> 24:55.683
Franklin's dead, sir.

24:55.767 --> 24:57.997
Is everyone else alright?

24:58.087 --> 24:59.884
Aye, sir.

25:00.447 --> 25:04.406
Security reports there are
no other intruders aboard.

25:04.487 --> 25:06.079
Captain.

25:06.727 --> 25:08.718
The Borg ship is gone.

25:09.607 --> 25:13.805
Sensor logs show they entered
the distortion field 30 seconds ago.

25:13.887 --> 25:18.199
They beamed on board as a diversion
to give their ship time to escape.

25:18.287 --> 25:23.441
Another change. They left their dead
instead of vaporising them.

25:24.887 --> 25:28.482
Captain, this one is still alive.

25:38.607 --> 25:40.404
I've stabilized his condition.

25:40.487 --> 25:43.479
He's still weak,
but he should make a full recovery.

25:43.767 --> 25:47.362
- Can you waken him?
- Yes, but it's very risky.

25:47.447 --> 25:49.597
- His heart rate is up.
- Do it.

25:52.727 --> 25:54.524
Alright.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.598
Lower the force field.

26:22.087 --> 26:23.759
What is your designation?

26:24.687 --> 26:27.406
I do not have a designation.

26:27.487 --> 26:29.443
My name is Crosis.

26:33.407 --> 26:36.524
Crosis? How did you get that name?

26:37.407 --> 26:40.638
- It was given to me by The One.
- Who is that?

26:40.727 --> 26:42.604
The one who will destroy you.

26:44.487 --> 26:46.762
But you are Borg.

26:46.847 --> 26:52.046
Your goal is not to destroy, but to
assimilate us into your collective.

26:52.447 --> 26:56.281
We do not assimilate
inferior biological organisms.

26:56.367 --> 26:58.358
We destroy them.

27:00.727 --> 27:05.596
Tell me more about this One.
Does he have a name?

27:07.327 --> 27:09.158
Is he called Hugh?

27:10.327 --> 27:14.559
Klingon. Shatter cranial exoskeleton
at the tricipital lobe.

27:14.647 --> 27:16.399
Death is immediate.

27:17.167 --> 27:20.523
Why must this One
destroy biological organisms?

27:20.967 --> 27:23.003
Human.

27:23.087 --> 27:26.045
Sever spinal cord.
Death is immediate.

27:26.447 --> 27:31.237
I am Locutus of Borg!
You will respond to my questions.

27:38.407 --> 27:39.999
This is going nowhere.

27:40.087 --> 27:43.045
Doctor, do an autopsy
on the other one.

27:43.127 --> 27:46.164
Compare it with
what we learned of Hugh's anatomy.

27:46.247 --> 27:49.205
See if there have been
any recent modifications

27:49.287 --> 27:51.881
that explain behavioural differences.

27:51.967 --> 27:54.879
Data, run a biospectral
analysis on this Borg.

27:54.967 --> 27:58.277
See if he is trying to send
a subspace signal to the others.

27:58.367 --> 27:59.846
Aye, sir.

28:06.367 --> 28:08.358
You are not like the others.

28:08.927 --> 28:12.476
You do not have to be destroyed.
You can be assimilated.

28:12.567 --> 28:18.039
- I do not wish to be assimilated.
- Resistance is futile.

28:18.127 --> 28:21.085
You will not resist
what you've wanted all your life.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.278
I was like you once.

28:24.687 --> 28:29.158
Without feeling.
But The One helped me.

28:29.247 --> 28:32.045
He can help you, too.
He can help you find emotion.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.846
Have you ever felt
a real emotion, Data?

28:38.847 --> 28:40.246
Yes.

28:41.447 --> 28:46.157
On Ohniaka III,
I was forced to kill a Borg.

28:47.647 --> 28:49.160
I got angry.

28:49.247 --> 28:54.002
How did it feel to get angry?
Did it give you pleasure?

28:56.847 --> 29:00.396
It would be unethical
to take pleasure in another's death.

29:00.487 --> 29:02.796
You didn't answer my question.

29:02.887 --> 29:04.878
Did it feel good to kill?

29:08.407 --> 29:09.806
Yes.

29:11.287 --> 29:16.520
If it is unethical to take pleasure
from another being's death,

29:16.607 --> 29:19.440
you must be
a very unethical person.

29:21.407 --> 29:22.681
No.

29:24.207 --> 29:26.198
That is not correct.

29:27.407 --> 29:30.001
My creator, Dr Soong,
gave me a program

29:30.087 --> 29:33.284
which defines my sense
of right and wrong.

29:34.447 --> 29:37.678
In essence, I have a conscience.

29:39.367 --> 29:42.723
It didn't seem to be functioning
on Ohniaka III

29:42.807 --> 29:46.686
when you felt pleasure
in killing that Borg.

29:46.767 --> 29:49.042
Step away from the force field.

29:49.927 --> 29:53.317
Your proximity
is interfering with my scan.

29:53.687 --> 29:55.996
You enjoyed it.

29:56.087 --> 29:59.318
That surge of emotion inside you

29:59.407 --> 30:02.558
as you watched the life
drain from your victim.

30:02.647 --> 30:06.276
It was unlike anything
you've ever felt before.

30:07.287 --> 30:11.075
It was a very potent experience.

30:11.767 --> 30:14.076
You'd like to feel that way again.

30:16.327 --> 30:17.806
Yes.

30:18.047 --> 30:21.756
You'd do anything
to feel that way again,

30:21.847 --> 30:23.917
even if it meant killing someone.

30:26.247 --> 30:27.646
No.

30:28.567 --> 30:30.239
That would not be ethical.

30:30.767 --> 30:35.283
You don't sound very sure.
Is your ethical program functioning?

30:35.807 --> 30:37.399
Data?

30:38.567 --> 30:40.558
Do you have a friend?

30:42.927 --> 30:44.326
Yes.

30:46.127 --> 30:48.118
His name is Geordi.

30:49.687 --> 30:54.124
If it meant that you could
feel emotions again,

30:54.967 --> 30:59.961
the way you did on Ohniaka III,
would you kill your friend?

31:00.887 --> 31:02.878
Would you kill Geordi?

31:05.927 --> 31:07.326
Yes.

31:08.847 --> 31:10.838
I would.

31:16.727 --> 31:22.359
Our current theory is that the Borg
have established transwarp conduits.

31:22.447 --> 31:26.201
The ship enters the conduit
and is immediately accelerated.

31:26.287 --> 31:30.326
It's like falling into a river
and being swept away by the current.

31:30.407 --> 31:33.444
How fast would a ship
travel through these conduits?

31:33.527 --> 31:38.476
We don't know. Normal limitations
don't apply to transwarp variables.

31:38.567 --> 31:41.684
But I'd say, based on
our trip through the conduit,

31:41.767 --> 31:46.636
the speed would be at least 20 times
faster than our maximum warp.

31:46.727 --> 31:48.718
How do they open the conduits?

31:48.807 --> 31:51.879
The Borg ship emitted
a high-energy tachyon pulse

31:51.967 --> 31:54.527
just before we saw
the subspace distortion.

31:54.607 --> 31:59.078
It seems the conduits are keyed
to respond to a specific frequency.

31:59.447 --> 32:00.880
Can we duplicate...

32:00.967 --> 32:03.879
Captain,
a shuttlecraft has left bay two.

32:03.967 --> 32:06.481
- Who authorized a launch?
- No one.

32:06.567 --> 32:11.197
Picard to shuttle. Identify yourself
and return to the ship immediately.

32:12.167 --> 32:15.523
Mr. Worf, lock on with a tractor
beam and return it to the ship.

32:15.607 --> 32:17.086
Aye, sir.

32:19.687 --> 32:23.362
The tractor beam has been disabled.
Override is not functioning.

32:23.447 --> 32:26.644
Captain,
I'm picking up a tachyon surge.

32:26.727 --> 32:30.766
Whoever's in the shuttle is trying
to trigger the transwarp conduit.

32:32.527 --> 32:34.518
Do we know who's on board?

32:35.967 --> 32:38.162
It is the Borg prisoner.

32:38.247 --> 32:39.680
And Cmdr Data.

32:53.287 --> 32:55.323
Can we follow them into the conduit?

32:55.407 --> 32:59.195
We can read their tachyon pulse.
We might be able to duplicate it.

32:59.287 --> 33:03.963
The question is, is Data a prisoner?
Or did he go willingly?

33:04.047 --> 33:07.960
The overrides used to disable
the tractor beam were Cmdr Data's.

33:08.047 --> 33:11.562
The Borg could have got the codes
from Data's positronic net.

33:11.647 --> 33:15.606
Perhaps Data's recent flash
of emotion is connected to this.

33:15.687 --> 33:18.804
It could have affected him
more deeply than we realize.

33:18.887 --> 33:23.483
- Either way, we have to find him.
- I've set up a tachyon matrix.

33:23.567 --> 33:26.320
I can simulate
the pulse sent by the shuttle.

33:26.767 --> 33:29.645
- Mr. Worf, red alert.
- All hands, battle stations!

33:31.927 --> 33:34.202
Bring us to where
we last saw the shuttle.

33:34.287 --> 33:36.323
Shields up. Weapons ready.

33:37.047 --> 33:39.481
- Mr. Forge?
- Energizing the matrix.

33:40.527 --> 33:43.439
Emitting tachyons
in the lower bandwidth.

33:45.367 --> 33:48.325
Sensors show
no unusual subspace activity.

33:48.687 --> 33:52.043
Alright.
Switching to the secondary bandwidth.

33:53.447 --> 33:54.960
Nothing.

33:55.047 --> 33:58.676
Maybe if I try
alternating the frequencies.

34:01.607 --> 34:06.123
Captain, there is an energy
fluctuation directly ahead of us.

34:06.207 --> 34:09.563
- It is the subspace distortion.
- Take us in. Half-impulse.

34:14.047 --> 34:16.402
Power levels are down to 67 percent.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.206
Compensating with auxiliary power.

34:22.927 --> 34:24.201
Report.

34:24.286 --> 34:27.404
Navigational sensors
show that we've travelled

34:27.487 --> 34:30.399
65 light years
from our previous position.

34:37.206 --> 34:39.596
Can you locate the shuttle?

34:40.847 --> 34:45.045
No, sir. There is no indication
of the shuttle within sensor range.

34:46.007 --> 34:49.283
Maybe we can find an energy signature
from their engines.

34:49.367 --> 34:54.043
Captain, I've scanned three different
star systems within sensor range.

34:54.127 --> 34:57.517
There is evidence of at least
two advanced civilizations,

34:57.607 --> 34:59.006
but I read no life signs.

34:59.087 --> 35:04.002
But there are signs plasma weapons
were fired in those systems recently.

35:04.087 --> 35:06.078
The Borg have been busy.

35:06.567 --> 35:10.321
I think we've found
the shuttle's energy signature.

35:13.247 --> 35:16.398
Their heading, 247 mark 059.

35:16.487 --> 35:19.638
Lay in that course, Ensign.
Engage at full-impulse.

35:19.727 --> 35:21.285
Aye, sir.

35:30.887 --> 35:33.162
We traced the shuttle to this point

35:33.247 --> 35:35.886
but there's too much
interference to scan.

35:35.967 --> 35:40.199
- Are they jamming our sensors?
- More likely a natural phenomenon.

35:40.287 --> 35:44.041
There's a lot of EM interference
in the planet's magnetosphere.

35:44.127 --> 35:45.765
Can we transport through it?

35:45.847 --> 35:50.079
We could, but there could be 50 Borg
down there and we'd never know it.

35:52.847 --> 35:54.326
We have to risk it.

35:56.847 --> 36:00.999
Agreed. Take a well-armed away team
and transport down.

36:01.087 --> 36:03.726
Have the transporter chief
keep a lock on you

36:03.807 --> 36:05.763
so we can get you out quickly.

36:05.847 --> 36:07.917
Aye, sir. Mr. Worf, you're with me.

36:17.967 --> 36:20.640
Riker to Enterprise.
We're on the surface.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.717
There's no sign of any Borg.

36:24.207 --> 36:26.198
Or Data.

36:26.887 --> 36:29.196
The shuttle appears to be abandoned.

36:32.007 --> 36:36.797
The EM interference is limiting the
tricorder range beyond 100 meters.

36:38.167 --> 36:41.398
There are no structures.
They could have gone anywhere.

36:41.487 --> 36:43.876
Can you tell
when they left the shuttle?

36:50.367 --> 36:52.517
The engine's been off three hours.

36:53.407 --> 36:54.840
Stand by.

36:54.927 --> 36:59.159
If they're still together, how far
could they travel in three hours?

36:59.247 --> 37:03.160
Data can move pretty fast, but based
on what we know about the Borg,

37:03.247 --> 37:06.284
they shouldn't be able to
move any faster than you or I.

37:06.367 --> 37:10.485
They might have been able to get
15 to 20 kilometres away by now.

37:11.087 --> 37:14.716
Picard to Riker. I'm going to
send down other away teams.

37:14.807 --> 37:17.765
Set up a command post
and begin mapping a search plan.

37:17.847 --> 37:19.838
- Understood.
- Picard out.

37:20.607 --> 37:23.519
I want to use the shuttlecraft
for reconnaissance.

37:23.607 --> 37:26.405
- Assemble the designated pilots.
- Aye, sir.

37:26.487 --> 37:31.322
All personnel, including you and me,
will create four-man away teams.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.920
I'll leave a skeleton crew
on board the ship.

37:36.327 --> 37:39.239
Who'll be in command
of the Enterprise?

37:40.167 --> 37:42.158
Any last orders?

37:42.767 --> 37:46.760
If the Borg should attack, don't wait
for me to return to the ship,

37:46.847 --> 37:51.079
but take her to a transwarp conduit.
Return to Federation space.

37:51.607 --> 37:53.404
Got it.

37:55.287 --> 37:57.357
Good luck, Jean-Luc.

37:57.447 --> 37:59.244
Good luck, Captain.

38:08.207 --> 38:10.004
I've sent out 12 teams so far.

38:10.087 --> 38:12.726
I've got your team
searching section Gamma 24.

38:12.807 --> 38:15.924
Worf and I will take Theta 16
when the last team comes down.

38:16.007 --> 38:18.965
- Who's at the command post?
- Wallace and Towles.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.844
Ready?

38:53.767 --> 38:55.280
Anything, Mr. La Forge?

38:57.647 --> 38:59.683
Well, no.

38:59.767 --> 39:01.120
Nothing, sir.

39:01.207 --> 39:04.995
What if we modified the phasers
to send out a luvetric pulse?

39:05.087 --> 39:07.885
It might create a resonance
in Data's power cells.

39:07.967 --> 39:11.926
Home in on that response with
the tricorders. I thought about that.

39:12.007 --> 39:15.079
But the pulse would probably
have to be so powerful,

39:15.167 --> 39:18.955
it would destroy Data's
positronic net in the process.

39:19.047 --> 39:21.925
Captain,
I think I've found something.

39:35.727 --> 39:37.718
Come on.

39:50.487 --> 39:54.002
I'm having a very difficult time
scanning the interior.

39:54.887 --> 39:57.276
Can you tell
if it was built by the Borg?

39:58.487 --> 40:02.162
I don't think so.
There are no Borg energy signatures.

40:02.927 --> 40:08.160
But there is a door or a hatch or
something about 20 meters this way.

40:34.567 --> 40:37.400
This seems to be
some kind of meeting place.

40:37.487 --> 40:39.603
It certainly hasn't been abandoned.

40:41.887 --> 40:43.878
Something's wrong.

40:44.527 --> 40:48.805
I can't get any kind of energy
signatures from these light sources.

40:48.887 --> 40:50.684
It's a dampening field.

40:50.767 --> 40:55.682
This structure could be shielded
from our sensors. Let's go.

40:57.807 --> 41:00.037
There they are!

41:00.607 --> 41:02.359
Block the exit.

41:14.967 --> 41:16.366
Stop!

41:19.407 --> 41:22.399
- Data?
- That's not Data.

41:24.007 --> 41:25.076
What?!

41:25.447 --> 41:29.998
You should listen to her, Captain.
She's way ahead of you.

41:31.167 --> 41:32.964
Lore!

41:34.407 --> 41:36.204
Right.

41:36.807 --> 41:38.604
And I'm not alone.

41:43.487 --> 41:46.923
The sons of Soong
have joined together.

41:47.007 --> 41:50.886
And together,
we will destroy the Federation.
