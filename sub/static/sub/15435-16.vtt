00:00.300 --> 00:01.700
brothers.and.sisters.s02e16

00:01.700 --> 00:03.300
WHAT ABOUT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY?

00:03.300 --> 00:04.800
???

00:04.800 --> 00:07.200
-IT IS YOUR FERTILE WINDOW.
-I MISSED THAT.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.700
-WILL YOU PLEASE MARRY ME?
-YES.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.400
DAD HAD ANOTHER KID WITH HOLLY.
HER NAME IS REBECCA.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.000
I HAD THIS WEIRD MOMENT WHERE I
THOUGHT I HAD FEELINGS FOR YOU.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.200
YOU LET WILLIAM WALKER DIE
THINKING THAT I WAS HIS KID.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.000
-HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?
-I WANT YOU OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
YOU OWE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT
OF MONEY, AND YOU NEED US.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.100
-A MERGER IS OUR ONLY OFFER.
-OKAY.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.000
I'M A GAY MAN, KEVIN.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.100
-WE'RE NOT RELATED.
-SO YOU LIED TO ME?

00:32.100 --> 00:34.700
-I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN--
-JUST GO!

00:34.700 --> 00:36.200
DAD WASN'T HER FATHER.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.300
SHE'S NOT A WALKER.
SHE NEVER WAS.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.500
ALL RIGHT.
SO WHERE ARE YOU?

00:41.500 --> 00:43.500
-HI. HI.
-NO, IT'S KITTY McCALLISTER.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.800
I'M CALLING FOR DR. FELDMAN.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.500
???

00:47.500 --> 00:50.800
BEFORE CELL PHONES, NO ONE HAD
THIS MUCH TO SAY TO EACH OTHER.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
KEVIN'S ON HIS WAY.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
-DID YOU TELL HIM?
-NO, I DIDN'T TELL KEVIN.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.400
THERE WOULD BE NO NEED
FOR A FAMILY MEETING IF I HAD

00:56.400 --> 00:58.300
BECAUSE EVERYONE
WOULD ALREADY KNOW.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.200
LOOK, HOLLY'S TRYING TO GET
INTO THE OJAI TAX FILES.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.100
WHAT'S THE PASSWORD?

01:02.100 --> 01:03.200
???

01:03.200 --> 01:04.700
REMEMBER, SHE'S THE REASON
OJAI'S DOING OK--

01:04.700 --> 01:05.600
???

01:05.600 --> 01:09.400
-SAUL, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES...
-NO, I WAS JUST WONDERING IF I'M--RIGHT.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.100
-NO, NO. THAT--THAT'S OKAY.
-WHO IS SHE TALKING TO?

01:11.100 --> 01:12.200
-???
-I UNDERSTAND. OKAY.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.200
-OH, KITTY, ARE YOU, UH...
-I DON'T KNOW.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.300
???

01:15.300 --> 01:17.000
YEAH, I GOTTA GO. BYE.
IF I DON'T GET TO WORK,

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
HOLLY'S GONNA START
RANSACKING MY DESK.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
???

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
?????

01:25.000 --> 01:26.500
PLEASE, MOM.
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.000
BUT PLEASE, I DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO OVERREACT.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.800
THIS AFFECTS REBECCA
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE,

01:31.800 --> 01:34.400
AND IT'S NOT HER FAULT.
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:34.400 --> 01:36.800
NOTHING HAS REALLY CHANGED.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.400
SO, I MEAN,
HOW SHOULD I SAY THIS?

01:38.400 --> 01:40.000
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
REBECCA'S NOT OUR SISTER.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.900
DAD WASN'T HER DAD.
D.N.A.--GOTTA LOVE IT.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.300
THANK YOU, JUSTIN.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.000
THAT'S NOW EXACTLY
HOW I WOULD'VE PHRASED IT,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.200
BUT THAT'S THE GIST OF IT.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.100
REBECCA IS NOT
YOUR BIOLOGICAL SISTER.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.800
-OH, MY GOD.
-WHO'S THE DAD THEN?

01:54.800 --> 01:56.100
-HOW LONG HAS SHE KNOWN?
-WAIT A MINUTE. HOW'S REBECCA?

01:56.100 --> 01:58.400
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
ONE AT A TIME, ONE AT A TIME.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.600
TOMMY, DAVID--HOLLY'S EX
IS REBECCA'S FATHER.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.700
SARAH, I GUESS REBECCA
HAS KNOWN FOR A FEW DAYS NOW.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.500
KITTY, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE'S DOING.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.500
I CALLED HER,
AND SHE HASN'T CALLED ME BACK.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.100
I EW IT. THIS IS--
THIS IS ALL HOLLY.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.000
SARAH, IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HOLLY?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.100
???

02:15.100 --> 02:16.500
KITTY'S RIGHT.
THE ONLY PERSON

02:16.500 --> 02:17.600
WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT
RIGHT NOW IS--

02:17.600 --> 02:18.300
???

02:18.300 --> 02:19.000
KEVIN.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.800
???
WITH HIS JUNIOR SPY KIT?

02:22.800 --> 02:24.100
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.100
WHAT?
NICE TRY. OKAY.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.700
???

02:27.700 --> 02:29.200
SCOTTY OBVIOUSLY WILL COOK.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.800
TOMMY, IF YOU COULD BRING
SOME WINE, THAT'D BE GREAT.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.600
JUSTIN, STAY SOBER.
SARAH, YOU GOT THE TOAST.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.400
KITTY, SINCE YOU WRITE SPEECHES
FOR A LIVING, WE--

02:36.400 --> 02:39.300
WE WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU COULD
OFFICIATE THE CEREMONY.

02:39.700 --> 02:43.000
OF-OFFICIATE?
ARE--ARE YOU ENGAGED TO SCOTTY?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
NO, I MET SOME GUY LAST NIGHT.
YEAH, OF COURSE TO SCOTTY.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.200
WOW. I REALIZE IT MAY BE
A SHOCK TO SOME OF YOU,

02:50.200 --> 02:52.300
BUT CONGRATULATIONS
MIGHT BE NICE.

02:52.300 --> 02:56.000
OH, HONEY.
THIS IS SO GREAT.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.100
-THANK YOU.
-???

02:58.100 --> 03:00.700
-WOW. YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?
-NO, NOT MARRIED. COMMITTED.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.300
NO COMMENTS
FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY.

03:02.300 --> 03:06.000
IT WOULD BE SO EASY, MAN.
I'M--I'M--I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.100
IT'S JUST WHAT WE NEED
RIGHT NOW. UH, WHEN?

03:09.100 --> 03:10.600
-SATURDAY?
-SATURDAY?

03:10.600 --> 03:11.300
WHY THE RUSH?

03:11.300 --> 03:13.600
WE FELT IT WAS TIME, AND SINCE
BOTH OF US HAVE ZERO DESIRE

03:13.600 --> 03:15.600
TO THROW SOME KIND
OF FAIRY-TALE SHINDIG--

03:15.600 --> 03:18.200
YES, I AM LOOKING AT YOU--
WE FIGURE, WHY NOT?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
CONGRATULATIONS.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.600
YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S... GREAT.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.500
THANK YOU. YOU ALL SOUND
SO HAPPY FOR ME.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.000
???

03:29.000 --> 03:31.200
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL KEVIN
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:31.200 --> 03:34.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ALL HERE TALKING ABOUT ME.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.200
HONEY, MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO SIT DOWN.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.600
THERE--THERE'S BEEN
ANOTHER LITTLE DEVELOPMENT.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.400
WHAT? YOU'RE NOT RELATED?

03:40.400 --> 03:41.300
NO. NO.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.400
I-I AGONIZED OVER MEETING HER,

03:43.400 --> 03:45.000
I COULD BARELY LOOK AT HER
FOR MONTHS,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.500
AND NOW AT I ACTUALLY
LIKE HER, I FIND OUT THAT

03:47.500 --> 03:51.300
SHE'S JUST THE LOVE CHILD OF
MY DAD'S MISTRESS AND SOME GUY.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.000
I MEAN, AND POOR REBECCA.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.700
SHE'S NOT EVEN
WHO SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.400
OKAY, I'M AT A LOSS.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.200
YEAH, SO I'M NOT OVERREACTING,RIGHT?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.000
IT'S--IT'S NOT
JUST THE HORMONES.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.300
NO. BUT YOUR BOOBS
DO LOOK BIGGER.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.400
NO, THEY'RE NOT. NO.
IT'S--IT'S JUST THE BRA.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.600
THEY'VE GOT HELP.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.600
DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE GLOW.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.100
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M GLOWING?

04:13.100 --> 04:14.100
I DO.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.200
OH. JUST STOP IT.
STOP IT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:16.200 --> 04:18.200
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET
MY HOPES UP. I'M...

04:18.200 --> 04:21.000
IT'S JUST FROM THE SHOCK
OF WAKING UP WITH TWO SISTERS

04:21.000 --> 04:24.200
AND FINDING OUT BY LUNCH
THAT I ONLY HAVE ONE.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.200
OH, YEAH.
AND KEVIN'S GETTING MARRIED.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.400
-WHAT?
-YEAH.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.800
I FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN PREEMPTED
BY A SPECIAL NEWS BULLETIN.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.400
SHOULD WE CHANGE THE DATE
OF OUR CEREMONY?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.500
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THE TIMING'S PERFECT.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.100
MOM'LL BE TOO PREOCCUPIED TO BE
HER LOVING BUT INTRUSIVE SELF.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.400
WELL, AT LEAST
SHE'LL BE THERE.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.800
YOU CALLED YOUR PARENTS?

04:43.800 --> 04:47.000
YES, AND SURPRISE, SURPRISE--
THEY CAN'T MAKE IT.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.100
OH, COME ON.
THEY LIVE IN ARIZONA.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.500
THEY CAN'T DRIVE FIVE HOURS

04:50.500 --> 04:53.300
TO BE AT THEIR SON'S
BONDING RITUAL?

04:53.300 --> 04:54.200
IS THAT WHAT
WE'RE CALLING IT NOW?

04:54.200 --> 04:55.900
BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS
KIND OF KINKY.

04:55.900 --> 04:59.900
???

05:00.200 --> 05:01.100
WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD SAY

05:01.100 --> 05:03.300
THAT'S AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION
OF MARRIAGE.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.100
WELL, WHATEVER WE ARE
CALLING IT,

05:05.100 --> 05:07.200
YOUR PARENTS SHOULD BE THERE.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.200
???

05:09.200 --> 05:12.100
I NEVER HEARD MY PARENTS
USE THE WORD GAY UNTIL I TOLD THEM I WAS.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.100
???

05:14.100 --> 05:15.700
I KNOW, BUT I'M TIRED
OF BANGING MY HEAD

05:15.700 --> 05:17.100
AGAINST THAT PARTICULAR WALL.

05:17.100 --> 05:21.100
OUR WHATEVER WE'RE CALLING IT
WILL BE BETTER WITHOUT THEM.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
ARE YOU REALLY
THAT OKAY WITH IT?

05:23.800 --> 05:25.000
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT,

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
SO YES, I AM OKAY.
REALLY.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.100
I ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT REBECCA WAS HIS DAUGHTER.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.200
I MEAN, THERE WAS SUCH
A REMOTE POSSIBILITY

05:39.200 --> 05:40.000
THAT SHE WASN'T.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.500
SO WHEN YOU AGREED
TO BAIL OUT OJAI,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.700
DID YOU KNOW REBECCA TOOK
A PATERNITY TEST?

05:43.700 --> 05:45.400
???

05:45.400 --> 05:46.000
SARAH.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
???WHERE YOU ANSWER IT.
YES, I KNEW.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE MERGER.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.500
MY ONLY MOTIVATION WAS BELIEVING
THAT I OWED IT TO WILLIAM

05:55.500 --> 05:56.800
TO SAVE HIS COMPANY.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.800
AND DID YOU OWE IT TO HIM
TO LIE, TOO?

05:58.800 --> 06:01.200
-NO, I NEVER LIED TO HIM.
-OH, COME ON, HOLLY.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.700
THE ONLY REASON
DAD LEFT YOU ANY MONEY

06:02.700 --> 06:04.400
WAS THAT HE THOUGHT
REBECCA WAS HIS DAUGHTER.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.200
ARE YOU JOKING?

06:05.200 --> 06:07.000
???

06:07.000 --> 06:09.600
THE INITIALS OF ALL HIS
CHILDREN--THE LAST ONE WAS R.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.300
TELL ME HE WASN'T THINKING
OF REBECCA.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.700
???

06:12.700 --> 06:14.000
BESIDES, IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY.

06:14.000 --> 06:14.700
???

06:14.700 --> 06:16.000
?????

06:16.000 --> 06:17.700
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH MONEY
I GOTTA SPEND.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.000
-YOU ARE NOT GETTING A DIME.
-WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA SUE ME?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.800
-YOU BET.
-ON WHAT GROUNDS?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.600
IT'S FRAUD, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.600
???FOR OVER 20 YEARS

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
SO IF AND WHEN
YOUR FATHER DIED,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
-I COULD INHERIT HIS BUSINESS?
-THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK.

06:33.000 --> 06:33.500
WELL, YOU'RE INSANE.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.600
HOLLY, WILL YOU
GIVE US A MINUTE?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.600
YEAH, I WOULD BE GLAD TO
BECAUSE YOUR SISTER

06:37.600 --> 06:41.300
OBVIOUSLY LOSES ALL REASON
WHEN I'M THE ROOM.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.300
SARAH, THE MERGER INCLUDED
A NON-LIABILITY CLAUSE,

06:46.300 --> 06:47.200
AND WE ALL SIGNED IT.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.100
SHE DECEIVED US, TOMMY.
WHAT--WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

06:50.100 --> 06:53.000
ME? YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WENT
LOOKING FOR REBECCA IN THE FIRST PLACE,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.400
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WAS
OBSESSED WITH THAT BABY PICTURE,

06:55.400 --> 06:58.700
AND YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
TOLD HER OUR DAD WAS HER FATHER.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.000
SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY TO BLAME,

07:01.000 --> 07:02.800
LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.200
GOD, TOMMY.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.000
AT LEAST DAD
COULD KEEP HER IN LINE.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.300
LOOK, SARAH.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.800
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU BRING
THIS BUSINESS DOWN TO GET BACK AT HOLLY.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.300
AS COPRESIDENT
OF THIS COMPANY,

07:16.300 --> 07:19.100
I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.900
SO JUST LET IT GO.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@xxy
Sync:FRS@²Ë33</font>

07:32.500 --> 07:34.800
OKAY, I NEED A GUEST COUNT.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.000
OH, NO, MOM. IS THE FAMILY,
A COUPLE OF SCOTTY'S FRIENDS

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
AND A FEW PEOPLE
FROM THE FIRM.

07:39.000 --> 07:39.600
THAT'S IT.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.400
???

07:42.400 --> 07:44.300
I CALLED CHRISTOE,
AND HE SAID HE COULD DO

07:44.300 --> 07:46.600
A LOT OF REALLY NICE FLOWERS
ON A RUSH.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.000
???

07:47.000 --> 07:48.700
-IT'S REALLY NO PROBLEM.
-MOM, I DON'T CARE

07:48.700 --> 07:50.200
IF YOU'RE ON FIRST-NAME TERMS
WITH THE FLORIST.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.800
THE ANSWER IS NO.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.800
PUT SCOTTY'S PARENTS
DOWN THERE.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.000
THEY'RE NOT COMING.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.100
WELL, YOU NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE
MORE NOTICE.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.700
IT'S NOT THE NOTICE PART
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

07:58.700 --> 08:01.700
IT'S THE TWO GROOMS PART.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.100
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.000
LOOK, MOM,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
NOT--NOT EVERY PARENT
JOINS P.F.L.A.G.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
WHEN THEIR KID COMES OUT.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.400
IT'S--IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.800
SCOTTY WASN'T EXPECTING THEM.

08:09.800 --> 08:13.800
NO, NO. EVEN IF YOU EXPECT
THE WORST FROM YOUR PARENTS,

08:13.800 --> 08:16.500
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT DOESN'T HURT
WHEN IT HAPPENS.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.000
-COULD I CALL TM?
-YOU COULD CALL THEM,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.200
BUT UNLESS YOU TELL THEM
I'M A WOMAN,

08:19.200 --> 08:20.500
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE
MUCH LUCK.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.800

08:21.800 --> 08:23.800
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW LONG IT TOOK

09:29.700 --> 09:31.100
I KNOW, AND THAT--
THAT MEANS A LOT. I JUST--

09:31.100 --> 09:35.000
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT
EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME WAY.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.400
YOU MEAN YOUR MOM?

09:36.400 --> 09:39.200
NO. WE'RE NOT TALKING

I MEANT JUSTIN.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
OH, WELL...JUSTIN IS JUST
HURT AND CONFUSED.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.200
I'M SURE YOU'RE HURT
D CONFUSED.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.600
NORA, IF I WOULD'VE KNOWN
ANY OF THIS,

09:48.600 --> 09:50.500
I WOULD NEVER
HAVE LET IT HAPPEN.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.200
???

09:52.200 --> 09:54.000
I'M GLAD YOU'RE IN MY LIFE.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.900
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY THAT.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.800
REBECCA, LAST SUMMER
WHEN JUSTIN WAS IN IRAQ,

10:00.800 --> 10:02.000
YOU TOOK CARE OF ME.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.500
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
ALL THOSE NIGHTS

10:03.500 --> 10:06.100
YOU STAYED UP LATE WITH ME
RIGHT HERE,WATCHING OLD MOVIES,

10:06.100 --> 10:07.600
AND THE TIMES
YOU ANSWERED THE PHONE

10:07.600 --> 10:10.600
WHEN I WAS TOO PETRIFIED
TO PICK IT UP?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.800
HAVE I EVER EVEN THANKED YOU?

10:12.800 --> 10:16.800
I WOULD'VE DONE IT WHETHER
YOU'RE FAMILY OR NOT.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.300
THERE'S MORE TO FAMILY
THAN JUST D.N.A.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.400
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT ANY STUPID TEST.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.200

I'M GONNA CALL OUT
THESE NUMBERS. WRITE THEM DOWN.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.200
KEVIN AND SCOTTY
HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON--

10:42.200 --> 10:45.500
A ZEST FOR LIFE,
A WICKED SENSE OF HUMOR,

10:45.500 --> 10:47.500
A LOVE OF HAIR PRODUCTS.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.400
WHAT?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
BUT N-NO--NO.
THAT'S FUNNY.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.100
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
OFFICIATING A CEREMONY,

10:54.100 --> 10:56.300
NOT HOSTING A ROAST.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.700
???TO SIT THERE
AND CRITICIZE WHEN...

11:01.300 --> 11:03.000
THIS HAS TO BE HIM.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.900
HELLO.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.500
HI, DR. FELDMAN.
UH-HUH.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.200
YOU OKAY?

11:30.200 --> 11:33.500
YEAH. I GUESS DR. FELDMAN
WAS JUST HUMORING US,

11:33.500 --> 11:35.800
LETTING US THINK
WE COULD GET PREGNANT

11:35.800 --> 11:39.000
BY ACTUAL HUMAN INTERCOURSE.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.700
WELL, AT LEAST
WE ENJOYED THE PROCESS.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.500
YEAH, NOW IT'S BACK
TO PETRI DISHES

11:42.500 --> 11:44.700

PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THIS.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.200
ARE YOU GIVING UP?

11:51.200 --> 11:52.100
NO, I'M NOT GIVING UP.

11:52.100 --> 11:54.500
???

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO HAVE A BABY.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.600
???

11:58.600 --> 12:00.500
ALL I'M SAYING
IS THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.000
WE COULD USE SURROGACY.
WE COULD ADOPT.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I KNOW. BUT I STILL
WANT TO BE PREGNANT.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.600
THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT YOU
CAN JUST TABLE IN SUBCOMMITTEE

12:09.600 --> 12:12.400
AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT MOTION.

12:13.100 --> 12:17.100
AND PLEASE...DON'T TRY TO FIX THIS.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.000
OH, I'M SORRY.
DID I KNOW HIM?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.400
NO. SHE WAS A LOBBYIST
FOR THE FOOD INDUSTRY.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.100
I'D SEE HER AT CONVENTIONS,
EVENTS, THAT SORT OF THING.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.000

13:48.500 --> 13:51.300
UH, DID MOM

13:51.700 --> 13:53.500
NO, THE FRIEND THAT DIED,

13:53.500 --> 13:56.800
SHE LEFT BEHIND A HUSBAND
AND THREE KIDS.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.800
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
SO MANY THINGS

13:58.800 --> 14:02.300

14:08.200 --> 14:10.300
IS THAT COMMON?

14:10.300 --> 14:11.500
YOU KNOW,
I THINK THIS IS GETTING

14:11.500 --> 14:12.500
A LITTLE AWKWARD
FOR THE TWO OF US.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.000
WHY DON'T WE GET BACK
TO THE CONTRACT?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.400
WELL, I TRIED TO DO THAT
WITH YOU FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.000

14:20.000 --> 14:21.600
KEVIN, I KNOW I DIDN'T HANDLE THINGS
TOO WELL BACK THEN.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.200
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AME.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.100
YOU DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
AT WORK TO KNOW.

14:26.100 --> 14:30.100
-WHAT, AND I WASN'T?
-I WAS A KID.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000

OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.600
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

17:56.600 --> 18:00.600
I'M FEELING LIKE
A CAFFEINATED DIET SODA OR--

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
OR MAYBE A VODKA.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
WELL, SODA'S UP TOP.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.400
VODKA'S IN THE FREEZER.

18:05.400 --> 18:09.000
I GUESS I, UH, I JUST NEEDED
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.500
DID, UM...
YOU AND ROBERT HAVE A--

18:12.500 --> 18:14.900
-I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
-OKAY.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.600
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST THAT--

18:16.600 --> 18:19.100
THAT ROBERT
IS READY TO MOVE ON.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.400
YOU KNOW, HE WANTS TO ADOPT
OR USE A SURROGATE.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.600
IT'S LIKE, PLAN A DIDN'T WORK.
GO RIGHT ON TO PLAN B.

18:24.600 --> 18:28.200
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.
TOMMY LAID INTO ME ABOUT HOLLY.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.100
THE ONLY REASON
DAD LEFT HER $10 MILLION

18:30.100 --> 18:33.100
IS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT SHE WAS
THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.500
BUT I AM SUPPOSED TO JUST
LET THAT GO.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.100
WELL, WHAT--WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT IS ABOUT MEN?

18:38.100 --> 18:39.300
IS IT JUST IN THEIR GENES?

18:39.300 --> 18:41.400
IT'S JUST THE--
THE MOVE-ON CHROMOSOME?

18:41.400 --> 18:45.000
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF MOVING ON. SEE THOSE?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.100
DAD'S PERSONAL FILES--

18:46.100 --> 18:48.100
THE ONES THAT LED ME
TO REBECCA IN THE FIRST PLACE.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.100
IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THERE

18:49.100 --> 18:52.300
THAT PROVES THAT HOLLY TRIED
TO DEFRAUD OUR FAMILY,

18:52.300 --> 18:54.200
I WILL FIND IT.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.400
HOW ABOUT YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

18:57.400 --> 18:58.700
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, ROBERT HAS A POINT.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.400
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT OF IT MYSELF.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.400
IT'S--DO--DO YOU--
DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME

19:03.400 --> 19:05.000
THAT YOU CAME TO NEW YORK

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
AND I TOOK YOU OUT
FOR INDIAN FOOD?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
???

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT,
IT WAS HOTTER THAN HELL,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.100
THE WORST HEARTBURN
OF MY LIFE.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.000
I REMEMBER
TOUCHING YOUR STOMACH

19:15.000 --> 19:17.400
WHEN WE WENT BACK
TO MY APARTMENT,

19:17.400 --> 19:21.200
AND--AND--AND COOPER WAS
PRACTICALLY DOING SOMERSAULTS.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.400
AND I JUST THOUGHT,
HOW WEIRD...

19:24.500 --> 19:27.000
AND HOW BEAUTIFUL.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.500
NOW I-I DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO MOVE ON.

19:29.500 --> 19:33.300
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO STOP WANTING THAT.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.600
KITTY, YOU REMEMBER
THE SOMERSAULTS.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.800
I REMEMBER THE HEARTBURN.
YOU KNOW WHAT COOPER REMEMBERS?

19:38.800 --> 19:39.600
NOTHING.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.600
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.000
IN THE END,
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
IS THAT THERE'S A CHILD,
AND THAT LASTS FOREVER.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.400
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK WE PASSED IT.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.200
NO, THAT WAS RED CEDAR MALL.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.700
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR RED CEDAR TERRACE.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.200
NOT ONLY AM I GETTING HITCHED TONIGHT,

20:03.200 --> 20:06.300
I PICK TODAY TO MEET THE IN-LAWS
WHO ALREADY HATE ME.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.500
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

20:09.300 --> 20:10.300
WHO ARE YOU TEXTING?

20:10.300 --> 20:11.800
NO ONE. I'M USING MY GPS.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.800
YOU HAVE GPS, AND YOU LET US
DRIVE AROUND IN CIRCLES THIS WHOLE TIME?

20:15.800 --> 20:17.600
WELL, I WAS HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS, OKAY?

20:17.600 --> 20:18.700
WE NEED TO TURN AROUND.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.600
CAN I HELP YOU?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.500
HI, I'M KEVIN WALKER.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
SCOTTY'S FRIEND?

20:34.000 --> 20:34.900
YEAH.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.700
COULD I SPEAK WITH YOU?

20:38.400 --> 20:39.300
COME ON IN.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.200
THANK YOU.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.100
I DON'T ENVY HIM.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.200
SO, UH... (sighs)
YOU LIKE REBECCA?

20:58.500 --> 21:00.600
IT WAS A FLEETING MOMENT, OKAY?

21:01.600 --> 21:02.400
AND BESIDES, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.900
SHE LIED TO ME.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.400
LISTEN, JUSTIN,

21:06.400 --> 21:08.000
IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST
TO SEE 

21:08.000 --> 21:10.500
THAT YOU TWO HAVE ALWAYS... CONNECTED.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.100
SO MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING WORTH SALVAGING.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.500
I HAVE IMAGINED HIS WEDDING DAY

21:17.500 --> 21:19.100
SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE BOY.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.800
BUT WHAT YOU TWO ARE DOING,
IT'S NOT A WEDDING.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.900
IT'S NOT A UNION RECOGNIZED
BY THE CHURCH OR THE STATE.

21:25.900 --> 21:26.900
ACTUALLY, IT IS.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.400
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, IT IS.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.800
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT--IT'S--IT'S DIFFERENT.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.000
AND WE'RE DOING THIS
BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE A FAMILY,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.500
AND WE CHERISH FAMILY
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.800
SCOTT IS WHO HE IS.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.300
WE'VE ACCEPTED THAT,
AND WE LOVE HIM.

21:45.500 --> 21:49.900
BUT DON'T ASK US TO CELEBRATE
THIS CONTRIVED EVENT.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.800
WE DON'T WANT TO HURT OUR SON,

21:52.400 --> 21:55.500
BUT WE CAN'T SIT THERE
AND HAVE YOU RUB OUR NOSES

21:55.500 --> 21:57.200
IN THIS PRETEND WEDDING.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.000
IT IS TOO PAINFUL...

22:00.000 --> 22:01.500
AND TOO INSULTING.

22:10.300 --> 22:11.600
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.600
I'LL LET MYSELF OUT.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.100
UH, UH, KEVIN.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.200
I HAVE SOMETHING I'D LIKE YOU TO GIVTO SCOTT.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.100
WOULD YOU MIND?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.800
THE CUFF LINKS I WORE
AT MY WEDDING.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.300
I DON'T KNOW IF SCOTT
WILL REMEMBER, BUT, UM,

22:35.900 --> 22:38.100
I TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD
WEAR THEM AT HIS.

22:39.300 --> 22:41.900
 MR. WANDELL, YOU COULD
GIVE THESE TO HIM YOURSELF.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.100
TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.600
WE'RE NOT BAD PEOPLE.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.300
IT'S JUST, UM...

22:52.100 --> 22:53.100
I'LL GIVE THEM TO HIM.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.300
THANKS.

22:56.300 --> 22:57.100
THANK YOU.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.400
 WHO'S THIS?

23:23.100 --> 23:24.100
 <i>KITTY?</i>

23:24.300 --> 23:26.500
 <i>NO. WAIT. I DON'T KNOW.</i>

23:26.700 --> 23:28.000
 <i>IT'S TOMMY, I GUESS.</i>

23:28.000 --> 23:29.100
 <i>THAT'S YOUR DAD'S CAR?</i>

23:29.600 --> 23:33.800
 <i>YEAH. YEAH, HE GOT THAT CAR</i>
 <i>IN, LIKE, '79,</i>

23:34.800 --> 23:36.300
 <i>SO I GUESS IT'S JUSTIN.</i>

23:36.800 --> 23:37.700
MOM.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.100
ISN'T IT TIME TO GET READY?

23:40.100 --> 23:42.100
SORRY, HONEY. I GOT DISTRACTED.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.000
WH'S WRONG?

23:43.900 --> 23:45.100
OH, THERE'S THIS PROBLEM,

23:45.100 --> 23:47.200
AND I KNOW THE ANSWER
IS RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME,

23:47.200 --> 23:49.000
I'M JUST--I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.700
DADDY SAYS SOMETIMES THE BEST
WAY TO FIGURE OUT A PROBLEM

23:51.700 --> 23:54.200
IS TO NOT THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.000
WELL, YOUR DADDY'S VERY SMART.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.700
OKAY THEN, LET'S GO GET READY.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.500
HEY.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.700
GO AWAY.WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE EACH OTHER
BEFORE THE CEREMONY.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.700
WHAT IS IT? DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN IN THE LIVING ROOM?

24:21.700 --> 24:23.800
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I'VE BEEN BANNED FROM GOING IN.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.300
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.200
I DIDN'T SLEEP AT TOMMY'S LAST NIGHT,

24:28.200 --> 24:30.100
AND I DIDN'T HAVE A BACHELOR PARTY

24:30.300 --> 24:33.500
-BECAUSE WE DROVE TO ARIZONA TO SEE YOUR PARENTS.
-YOU WHAT?

24:33.500 --> 24:35.800
I THOUGHT I COULD CONVINCE THEM TO COME. I'M SO SORRY.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.500
-KEVIN, WHAT DID YOU DO,JUST SHOW UP AT THEIR DOORSTEP--
-HERE.

24:43.300 --> 24:44.400
THEY'RE YOUR FATHER'S.

24:44.700 --> 24:45.800
I KNOW. 

24:48.700 --> 24:51.400
I-I MADE THIS BOX FOR HIM IN SHOP CLASS.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.400
HE TOLD ME HE WAS GONNA 
PUT THESE IN THERE FOR SAFEKEEPING

24:57.400 --> 24:59.100
SO THAT ONE DAY, WHEN...

25:01.300 --> 25:03.500
WHEN I GOT MARRIED,
HE'D, UH...

25:06.600 --> 25:08.600
OH, GOD. WE'RE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.800
WHO CARES?

25:40.600 --> 25:41.900
I KNOW I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.200
YES, YOU DID.

25:43.300 --> 25:46.600
DAMN IT, KEVIN. YOU DESERVE
THIS NIGHT TO BE BEAUTIFUL.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.500
ALL RIGHT, YES, I GOT
CARRIED AWAY. I DON'T REGRET IT.

25:50.500 --> 25:54.000
BECAUSE TONIGHT, KEVIN,
YOU DON'T GET TO BE GUARDED OR CYNICAL.

25:54.500 --> 25:58.600
YOU AND SCOTTY DESERVE
THIS NIGHT TO BE AS ROMANTIC...

25:59.800 --> 26:02.600
AND MEMORABLE AS ANYONE ELSE'S.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.400
THANK YOU.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.400
YOU GAVE US A WEDDING.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.500
 I THOUGHT THAT IN TRUE WALKER STYLE,

26:18.500 --> 26:21.900
I WOULD SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU A-A SECRET.

26:22.900 --> 26:25.900
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
THAT KEVIN'S BEEN MARRIED.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.700
SEE, WHEN WERE KIDS,
WE USED TO PLAY WEDDING,

26:28.700 --> 26:31.200
AND MR. McBEAR OFFICIATED...

26:32.100 --> 26:34.400
AND I WOULD WEAR
MOM'S WHITE NIGHTGOWN.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.500
YOU REMEMBER, THE--THE SATINY NUMBER WITH RUFFLES...

26:37.500 --> 26:40.200
THAT JUST SCREAMED "BRIDE" TO ME AT THE TIME,

26:40.200 --> 26:42.900
AND TO KEVIN, WHO WANTED
TO WEAR IT MORE THAN I DID.

26:44.100 --> 26:47.500
RIGHT AFTERWARDS, WE WERE
THE PROUD PARENTS OF FIVE KIDS.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.400
AND I WAS THE MOM,

26:50.100 --> 26:51.400
KEVIN WAS THE DAD,

26:51.400 --> 26:53.600
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
OUR FAMILY LOOKED LIKE,

26:53.600 --> 26:55.100
SO THAT'S ALL WE KNEW.

26:55.600 --> 26:59.800
AND NOW HERE WE ARE
AT KEVIN'S SECOND WEDDING,

26:59.800 --> 27:02.000
AND THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.500
AND--AND THINGS THAT WE
THOUGHT TO BE TRUE

27:05.500 --> 27:07.000
TURNED OUT NOT TO BE.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.500
AND IT SEEMS THAT WHEN WE
GIVE UP ON WHAT WAS...

27:12.900 --> 27:16.000
WELL, THAT'S WHEN THINGS
THAT WE THOUGHT IMPROBABLE

27:16.000 --> 27:19.200
OR--OR IMPOSSIBLE, EVEN,

27:20.200 --> 27:22.100
HAPPEN RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.300
WELL, AS MR. McBEAR WOULD SAY...

27:28.200 --> 27:30.300
IT'S TIME TO EXCHANGE THE RINGS.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.100
OH.

27:33.100 --> 27:34.600
-WHAT'S WRONG?
-OH, MY GOD.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.000
KEVIN? YOU-YOU DIDN'T BRING ANY RINGS?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.400
OH, FOR GOD SAKES. HERE.
HERE WE GO.

27:42.700 --> 27:43.900
OKAY, SCOTTY,

27:44.300 --> 27:47.500
 PLEASE PLACE,UH, TOMMY'S RING

27:47.500 --> 27:49.200
ON KEVIN'S FINGER.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.300
KEVIN...

27:53.400 --> 27:54.500
PLEASE ACCEPT THIS RING

27:54.500 --> 27:57.800
AS A SYMBOL OF MY DEEPEST LOVE AND AFFECTION.

28:03.500 --> 28:07.700
KEVIN, PLEASE PLACE MY HUSBAND'S RING...

28:07.700 --> 28:09.500
ON SCOTTY'S FINGER.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.200
SCOTTY, PLEASE TAKE THIS RING

28:13.200 --> 28:16.300
AS A SYMBOL OF MY LOVE AND DEVOTION.

28:23.300 --> 28:26.500
AND SO BY THE AUTHORITY
THAT THEY HAVE BESTOWED ONTO ME,

28:27.400 --> 28:29.400
I NOW PRONOUNCE THEM, UM...

28:30.400 --> 28:31.300
O-

28:33.700 --> 28:35.300
-OFFICIALLY--
-MARRIED.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.400
HEY.

28:58.700 --> 28:59.600
HEY.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.300
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF PUNCH.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.300
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

29:04.700 --> 29:05.500
YEAH.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.400
WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:14.700 --> 29:15.900
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.300
I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE 

29:17.300 --> 29:19.600
TO FIND OUT THAT SOMEONE
YOU TRUSTED LIED TO YOU.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.000
I'M NOT MAD.

29:21.000 --> 29:21.900
YOU'RE NOT?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.100
I MEAN, I THOUGHT I WAS.

29:24.100 --> 29:26.000
I WAS... 

29:26.000 --> 29:28.500
I WAS JUST SHOCKED AND HUMILIATED.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.600
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO FEEL HUMILIATED.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.500
WELL, I DIDN'T NEED TO BE
SUCH A JERK EITHER.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.800
I MEAN, REBECCA, I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

29:33.800 --> 29:35.300
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.700
SO LET'S--LET'S MAYBE
START AT SQUARE ONE.

29:42.300 --> 29:45.200
UH, UH, HI.I'M JUSTIN WALKER.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.200
YOU'RE NOT A WALKER.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.600
YOU'RE JUST A GIRL I'M HOLDING MY HAND
 OUT TO REALLY AWKWARDLY.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.500
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

29:55.300 --> 29:56.900
-DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?
-NO, THANKS.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.700
YOU'VE OUTDONE YOURSELF
AGAIN, LITTLE SISTER.

30:00.700 --> 30:01.700
THANK YOU.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.800
SO I TOLD KEVIN.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.300
I CAME OUT TO HIM, I MEAN.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.900
OH, SAUL. I'M PROUD OF YOU.

30:08.700 --> 30:11.700
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS JUST TELL ONE PERSON,

30:11.900 --> 30:14.200
YOU KNOW, JUST SAY THE WORD OUT LOUD,

30:14.200 --> 30:17.100
AND... WELL, EVERYTHING WOULD BE EASY.

30:17.100 --> 30:19.400
GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALONE.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.500
I THINK THAT WAS THE BRAVEST
THING I'VE EVER WITNESSED.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.900
IT'S AMAZING WHAT OUR CHILDREN CAN TEACH US.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.800
LOOKS LIKE YOU, ME AND MOM ARE THE ONLY SINGLE GIRLS LEFT.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.500
YOU DON'T HAVEO INCLUDE ME.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.500
OH, NO. WE'RE LIKE THE MAFIA, US WALKERS.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.100
ONCE YOU'RE IN, YOU CAN NEVER GET OUT.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.100
WELL, I'M KIND OF GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.900
OH, HEY. I BROUGHT YOU THIS PHOTO.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.400
DAD HAD IT FOR YEARS.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.500
I GUESS HOLLY GAVE IT TO HIM.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.000
WEIRD.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.500
OKAY, I'M CONFUSED.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.100
I FOUND IT UP AT THE OJAI HOUSE.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.000
ACTUALLY, IT STARTED EVERYTHING.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.500
IT'S DAD'S CAR,AND SINCE IT WASN'T JUSTIN...

31:07.500 --> 31:08.900
I PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.100
THIS BABY ISN'T ME.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.500
WHAT? ARE YOU SURE?

31:14.500 --> 31:16.600
YEAH. NO, I DIDN'T HAVE
CHEEKS LIKE THAT.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.500
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT ME.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.400
WE ALL ASSUMED IT WAS REBECCA,
AND WE WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.000
BUT WHAT IF WE WEREN'T WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING?

31:30.800 --> 31:34.400
DAD USED HIS CHILDREN'S INITIALS
TO CREATE HIS PASSWORDS--

31:34.400 --> 31:37.500
SIX INITIALS, NOT FIVE.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.000
WE ALL DECIDED IT WAS REBECCA,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
BUT WHAT IF...

31:41.100 --> 31:42.900
WHAT IF THE'S SOMEONE ELSE OUT THERE?

31:43.500 --> 31:44.700
WHAT IF THERE'S ANOTHER "R

31:44.700 --> 31:46.300
OKAY, I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.400
-NO, LOOK, TOMMY, JUST HEAR ME THROUGH.
-SARAH, COME ON.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.800
 WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A GLASS OF WINE?
-YOU THINK I'M CRAZY?

31:50.800 --> 31:52.300
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE CRAZY.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.500
I THINK YOU'RE ANGRY
AND I THINK YOU'RE HURT.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.600
SARAH, SARAH, SARAH,

31:55.600 --> 31:57.300
HOLLY LIED TO DAD, OKAY?
SHE DUPED HIM.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.200
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. THAT'S RIGHT.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.200
DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE PHOTO.
LISTEN, I FOUND THE PHOTO,

32:01.200 --> 32:02.500
I PUT THE PUZZLE TOGETHER,

32:02.500 --> 32:06.400
AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CHILD.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.300
SARAH, PLEASE. JUST STOP.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.400
I MEAN, HOLLY, REBECCA, THBUSINESS--

32:12.400 --> 32:14.400
IT'S--IT'S JUST--
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.900
YES, I-I KNOW, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.100
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP
BEATING YOURSELF UP ABOUT IT.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.300
I MEAN, COME ON.

32:21.700 --> 32:22.900
IT'S KEVIN'S WEDDING.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.600
OH, I'M SORRY.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.900
IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE. LET'S JUST GO.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.300
YOU ALL THINK I'M GOING CRAZY?

32:30.700 --> 32:32.400
I'M JUST LOSING MY MIND.

32:34.000 --> 32:34.700
H--

32:35.500 --> 32:36.400
SAUL.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.200
OH, I SEE.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.500
EVERYBODY HUDDLED TOGETHER, TALKING ABOUT ME.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.000
NO, NO.
SAUL, NO.ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT, S--

32:42.000 --> 32:42.900
THAT'S OKAY, KEVIN.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.500
YOU TELL EVERYBODY EVERYTHING ANYWAY.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.200
OKAY, I'LL SAY IT. FINE.

32:46.900 --> 32:47.800
 I'M GAY.

32:51.300 --> 32:52.900
NO. W-WHAT?

32:52.900 --> 32:54.100
YOU'RE GAY?

32:55.500 --> 32:57.300
WE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU, SAUL.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.000
OH.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.300
MY GOD. THIS IS, LIKE,
THE GAYEST WEEK OF MY LIFE.

33:06.100 --> 33:09.700
OH, WOW. IT FEEL SO GOOD
TO GET OUT OF THOSE HEELS.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.700
ARE YOU FEELING MORE RELAXED
NOW THAT YOUR OFFICIANT DUTIES ARE OVER?

33:13.700 --> 33:16.700
OH, YOU KNOW, I AM STILL ON A HIGH.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.000
WHAT YOU DOING?

33:19.000 --> 33:23.100
I AM POURING US A LITTLE NIGHTCAP.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.100
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M PREGNANT.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.200
FOR YOU.

33:31.900 --> 33:32.900
CHEERS.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.000
YOU KNOW, I WAS, UH,

33:38.900 --> 33:41.400
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
ALL THE HORMONE SHOTS

33:41.400 --> 33:44.400
AND THE--THE ULTRASOUNDS

33:44.400 --> 33:46.800
AND ALL THE OVULATION STICKS,

33:46.800 --> 33:48.000
AND IT'S, UH...

33:50.100 --> 33:51.300
IT'S EXHAUSTING.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.300
YOU KNOW, I-I THINK

33:53.300 --> 33:57.700
I JUST HAD IT IN MY HEAD
THAT IT HAD TO BE A CERTAIN WAY,

33:57.700 --> 33:59.700
AND--AND, YOU KNOW, I GET IT.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.800
THINGS DON'T ALWAYS WORK OUT
THE WAY YOU PLAN.

34:04.700 --> 34:05.500
YEAH.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.900
I MEAN, KEVIN'S WEDDING
TURNED OUT BETTER THAN MINE.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.300
THERE ARE KIDS EVERYWHERE THAT NEED FAMILIES.

34:23.199 --> 34:24.199
AND WE CAN GIVE--

34:24.199 --> 34:27.400
YES. LET'S ADOPT.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.900
-REALLY?
-YEAH.

34:29.800 --> 34:30.800
OH, MY GOD.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.199
OH, ROBERT.

34:34.199 --> 34:36.199
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

34:38.699 --> 34:39.900
-WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
-WHAT?

34:40.800 --> 34:42.800
WHO'S GONNA CARRY WHO
ACROSS THE THRESHOLD?

34:43.300 --> 34:44.900
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT, DO WE?

34:44.900 --> 34:46.699
OH, IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT IT.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.400
OH, OH, GOD. YOU'RE HEAVY.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.900
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE ME
ALL THE WAY TO THE BEDROOM?

34:54.900 --> 34:56.900
IT'S FUNNY. IT'S OUR FIRST TIME
HOME AS A MARRIED COUPLE,

34:56.900 --> 34:59.600
AND SUDDENLY, I'M-- I'M NOT IN THEMOOD.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.400
YEAH, TOMMY WARNED ME THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.400
I'M GLAD YOUR MOM MADE SUCH A FUSS.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.800
ME, TOO. COME HERE.

35:09.700 --> 35:11.600
KEVIN, THANK YOU.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.400
EVEN THOUGH MY DAD COULDN'T BE THERE,

35:14.400 --> 35:17.000
I FELT LIKE HE WAS... IN SPIRIT.

35:21.100 --> 35:23.600
CAN I MEET YOU IN THE BEDROOM?
I'D--I'D LIKE TO CALL HIM.

35:24.900 --> 35:25.800
YOU SHOULD.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.600
I WAS, UH, JUST LOOKING FOR THOSE CONTRACTS.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.600
WHAT'S THIS?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.100
OH, HOW'D THAT GET IN THERE?

36:04.900 --> 36:07.500
DOUG MUST HAVE MIXED IT IN
WHEN HE GAVE ME HIS PAPERS.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.300
I'LL MAIL IT BACK TO HIM.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.300
WHO'S THE KID?

36:10.900 --> 36:12.400
OH, THAT FRIEND THAT PASSED AWAY,

36:12.400 --> 36:15.700
THIS IS HER YOUNGEST--RYAN.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.500
I'M GLAD YOU CAME WITH ME.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.400
OH, PLEASE. IT'S MY JOB.

36:21.700 --> 36:24.100
YES, BUT I ENJOY
SPENDING TIME WITH YOU.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
I LIKE IT, TOO.

36:48.800 --> 36:49.500
-KEVIN.
-HEY.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.200
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:51.200 --> 36:52.300
OH, OKAY, LISTEN,

36:52.300 --> 36:54.400
IF YOU AND SCOTTY HAD A FIGHT.
IT IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.700
TRUTH IS, EVERYONE'S A LITTLE
NERVOUS ON THEIR WEDDING NIGHT.

36:56.700 --> 36:57.600
YOU WERE RIGHT.

36:58.700 --> 37:00.100
OKAY, I'VE BEEN THINKING
LOT LATELY ABOUT DAD,

37:00.100 --> 37:01.800
AND ALL THIS--ALL THIS STUFF'S BEEN COMING BACK,

37:01.800 --> 37:03.100
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT

37:03.100 --> 37:05.200
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR SCOTTY
AND HIS PARENTS.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.800
ANYWAY, THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME,

37:07.800 --> 37:09.300
DAD AND I WERE AT A CONFERENCE FOR OJAI.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.900
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
HE TRIED TO BOND WITH ME AFTER I-I CAME OUT.

37:11.900 --> 37:13.600
THIS ISN'T EVEN 
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.600
WHAT IS IT ABOUT, KEVIN?

37:14.600 --> 37:15.500
THERE WAS A GUY THERE.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.000
 DOUG.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.400
OH, GOD. HIS NAME WAS DOUG.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.400
HE WAS TELLING DAD ABOUT
A FRIEND OF THEIRS WHO DIED--

37:21.400 --> 37:22.300
A WOMAN.

37:22.300 --> 37:22.800
WHO?

37:22.800 --> 37:25.200
I'M--I'M NOT SURE, BUT HE--
HE GAVE DAD AN ENVELOPE,

37:25.200 --> 37:26.900
AND I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING MORE OF IT,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.500
BUT I REMEMB DAD ASKING
HOW <i>RYAN</i> WAS HANDLING IT.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.800
AND I JUST ASSUMED RYAN WAS
THIS WOMAN'S HUSBAND, I GUESS.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.600
BUT LATER, I WAS GOING
THROUGH SOME CONTRACTS,

37:36.600 --> 37:37.900
AND I FOUND A PICTURE.

37:38.700 --> 37:39.700
WHAT PICTURE?

37:39.700 --> 37:42.600
THE PICTURE <i>YOU</i> FOUND IN OJAI,
THE ONE WE DECIDED WAS REBECCA.

37:42.600 --> 37:45.100
SARAH, I SWEAR, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEEN THAT PICTURE BEFORE,

37:45.100 --> 37:47.000
BUT I HAD. I SAW IT THEN.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.300
AND WHEN I ASKED DAD WHO IT WAS,

37:49.800 --> 37:51.800
HE SAID IT WAS THE WOMAN SON.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.500
YOU WERE RIGHT.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.200
THERE WAS ANOTHER "R,"
BUT IT WAS NEVER REBECCA.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.300
IT WAS A BOY,

38:00.600 --> 38:02.600
AND HIS NAME WAS RYAN.

38:06.100 --> 38:06.800
OH.

38:15.800 --> 38:16.600
MOM.

38:17.000 --> 38:17.900
SARAH.

38:17.900 --> 38:19.300
KEVIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:19.300 --> 38:21.800
YOU SHOULD BE WITH SCOTTY,
DRIVING DOWN THE COAST

38:21.800 --> 38:23.600
OR BUYING TICKETS TO CABO.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.200
MOM, WE HAVE SOMETHING WE NEED TO TELL YOU.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.000
WHAT?

38:29.200 --> 38:29.800
WHAT?

38:30.100 --> 38:32.400
UM... IT'S ABOUT DAD.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.100
 HEY.

38:49.900 --> 38:50.800
 HEY.

38:51.900 --> 38:52.800
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.500
THIS PLACE IS PRETTY HARD TO FIND.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.700
YEAH, I'M NOT STAYING AT MY MOM'S ANYMORE,

38:56.700 --> 38:58.500
SO OUR OTHER WALK WAS KIND OF OUT OF THE WAY.

38:58.500 --> 39:02.700
NO, IT'S GOOD. YOU KNOW,
NEW SETTINGS, NEW SITUATION.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.900
SO, UM...

39:09.100 --> 39:11.300
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT EVERYTHING,

39:12.500 --> 39:14.300
AND, UM, THE THING IS, I...

39:15.300 --> 39:18.500
I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN DO
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.300
I... I-I DON'T THINK
I CAN START FROM SQUARE ONE.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.200
OH, OKAY.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.100
JUSTIN, YOU WERE THE FIRSPERSON
TO REACH OUT TO ME.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.800
BEFORE ANYONELSE, YOU WERE MY FRIEND,

39:31.800 --> 39:33.000
AND WHEN EVERYTHING WAS HAPPENING

39:33.000 --> 39:34.600
THESE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I...

39:35.900 --> 39:37.700
YOU'RE THE PERSON I WANTED TO TALK TO.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.300
YOU ALWAYS ARE.

39:42.100 --> 39:43.000
YOU, TOO.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.700
AND I-I MEAN, EVERYTHING'S BEEN CRAZY.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.700
I MEAN, FIRST I FIND OUT
THAT I HAVE THIS FAMILY

39:47.700 --> 39:49.200
THAT--THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW EXISTED,

39:49.200 --> 39:50.600
AND THEN SUDDENLY, I-I-I DON'T. 

39:50.600 --> 39:51.400
REBECCA--

39:51.400 --> 39:52.900
BUT THEN IT TURNS OUT THAT I DO

39:54.000 --> 39:55.500
BECAUSE, BY SOME MIRACLE,

39:55.800 --> 39:58.000
YOU'RE ALL STILL WILLING TO ACCEPT ME.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.100
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER...

40:02.100 --> 40:04.900
WHAT IF, IN ALL OF THIS INSANITY...

40:06.900 --> 40:07.900
WHAT?

40:08.900 --> 40:11.000
IT WAS ALL JUST A WAY TO MEET YOU?

40:30.300 --> 40:33.100
-I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO DO NEXT.
-ME NEITHER. OH.
