00:54.888 --> 00:57.222
Let's get a cab.
I can't face the walk.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.312
Reporter: Situated on
the outskirts of the city

01:03.521 --> 01:05.522
on the first day
of a weeklong series

01:05.732 --> 01:07.524
of special reports from Iraq

01:07.734 --> 01:10.944
to mark the fifth anniversary
of the Allied invasion.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.281
Five years on we've commissioned
the most comprehensive survey

01:14.491 --> 01:16.909
of the Iraqi people
ever undertaken,

01:17.118 --> 01:18.619
and it seems
like the nation

01:18.828 --> 01:21.538
is deeply pessimistic
about the future.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.042
The people are concerned
over the continued rise in violence

01:25.251 --> 01:27.461
and about the remaining
deep divides

01:27.670 --> 01:32.800
in their society.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.385
Garvey's here.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.223
Hey, big Bill!

01:39.432 --> 01:42.101
Can't keep a good man down,
can they?

01:42.310 --> 01:44.520
- Nice to see you, mate.
- Yeah, you too.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.605
Karl, make us some tea,
will you?

01:46.815 --> 01:48.315
I've gotta get out
of this monkey suit.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.942
Eh, full acquittal
though, yeah?

01:50.151 --> 01:52.402
- Get in! Come here.
- Thanks, man.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.114
I knew it was bollocks. They'd never
make that stick, would they?

01:55.323 --> 01:57.032
It's a fucking waste
of the taxpayers' money.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.785
Tell you what, it should be legalized
anyway, shouldn't it?

01:59.994 --> 02:01.703
- Yeah. Anyway, do you want some tea?
- Yeah.

02:01.913 --> 02:05.040
Maggie, would you make
Garvey some tea, please?

02:20.390 --> 02:21.974
Oh!

02:22.183 --> 02:23.976
(sighs)

02:24.185 --> 02:26.812
Jesus Christ, it's like
a fucking noose!

02:27.021 --> 02:29.273
Undo the knot.
Come here.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.609
- You're just tightening it.
- Fucking get it off me, man!

02:32.819 --> 02:35.237
Calm down.
Just let us have a look.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.500
How long has
he been here, Maggie?

02:48.710 --> 02:51.628
- He's had a sandwich.
- The disgusting fat locust.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.214
He's not fat.
He's got big bones, Bill.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.008
Well, he's peasant stock,
isn't he?

02:56.217 --> 03:00.596
Now, you know, it's all beer
and armchairs and TVs,

03:00.805 --> 03:03.307
and they're just a load of slobs.
It sickens me.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.351
His dad was a moron
as well.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.896
Good to see
a friendly face.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.981
I thought I'd pop in,
make sure you're all right.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.359
Tough four months
for you boys, I'd imagine.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.612
I just thought I'd come
and put your mind at rest.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.823
Everything's
running smoothly.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.825
I knew it was
all in safe hands.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.453
Well, I'll pop
to the little boys' room.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.747
Hey, you've put on
a bit of weight there, Garv.

03:26.956 --> 03:30.167
- I don't think so.
- I think you're getting a little bit heavier.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.170
Yeah, I can see it on the sides...
like handles.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.547
Right, thanks.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.096
- (door opens, closes)
- Maggie: Hello, Eric.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.350
Thanks.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.853
- Boys.
- Karl: Eric.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.648
- They gave you cake for the way out, did they?
- Karl: Oh, yeah.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.900
- Bill: All right, Eric?
- Yeah, I'm all right. You?

03:55.109 --> 03:57.277
- Yeah, not too bad now.
- Looks like a slab of concrete.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.488
Bill:
Yeah. Ah, it's all right.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.074
A little bit stale. Taste's a bit
like petrol, but it's okay.

04:02.283 --> 04:05.494
Looks like a dog's crapped on it.
Look at it.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.496
Garvey:
I quite liked it.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.665
- I thought it was all right.
- Oh, it's all right.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.500
Karl: If you swill it down
with enough tea,

04:11.709 --> 04:13.460
it'll be getting there,
you know.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.921
Eric: Well, don't break
your teeth on it.

04:16.130 --> 04:19.298
- Where'd you get it?
- I got it from the shop at the end of the road.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.010
- Those Pakis are thieves, man.
- You shouldn't say that...

04:22.220 --> 04:24.054
Pakis... anymore,
should you?

04:24.264 --> 04:27.724
- What's someone from Afghanistan?
- Uh, Afghani.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.060
- There you go.
- Yeah, that's true.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.562
- Brain of Britain.
- Karl: Yeah.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.274
This needs
painting over, Maggie.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.777
Yeah, everything's
a mess here.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.406
We can't be too conspicuous.
That's the golden rule.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.202
I wouldn't want a new house.
They've always got problems.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.622
You can't trust builders.

04:50.832 --> 04:54.376
This situation needs sorting out,
tidying up.

04:54.585 --> 04:58.338
Yeah. Like someone
close in, obviously.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.507
Yeah.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.509
Well, it's an informant
culture, isn't it?

05:02.719 --> 05:05.512
- Listen, about that money...
- Don't worry about that now.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.432
- That's good of you, Garv.
- That's all right.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.101
- I'll sort it out next week.
- No sweat.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.395
- I'll bring it round to your house.
- Or down the club.

05:13.604 --> 05:17.357
- Yeah, okay. Thanks, man.
- It's only money, isn't it?

05:19.569 --> 05:21.903
- Eric: Any beer about?
- Only what you brought, mate.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.072
I thought this was meant
to be a big party.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.242
Well, I'll pop down the offy.
Who wants what?

05:27.452 --> 05:32.205
Get us some whiskey,
some wine and some beer.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.957
And some matches
or a lighter.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.168
- No, a lighter.
- All right.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.253
- (Bill sighs)
- Okay.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.547
(phone ringing)

05:40.757 --> 05:43.300
Oh, fuck's sake.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.973
Where's Garvey getting
the booze from?

05:50.183 --> 05:52.517
- Bill: Just the offy over the road.
- Valda's coming round.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.728
- Bill: Who's coming over?
- Valda's coming round.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.647
Ah. That's his new bird.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.442
- Is it?
- Karl: I've been going out with her for a year.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.903
Bill: He's not been going out
with her for a year at all.

06:03.112 --> 06:05.197
How long have you
actually known her?

06:05.406 --> 06:07.783
- I haven't seen her in about six months.
- He hasn't seen her.

06:07.992 --> 06:11.411
- How long did you go out for?
- About a year... 10 months.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.164
Eric: I thought I heard
she done one.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.583
She did, but she just rung up.
She's coming round.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.795
Eric: Maybe she's pregnant.
(laughs)

06:20.004 --> 06:22.672
Bill:
Yeah, that's...

06:22.882 --> 06:25.175
that's extremely unlikely.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.177
I fast for January.

06:27.387 --> 06:31.098
No to poisons, no to drugs,
no food.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.849
I only allow myself tea.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.893
- Karl: And whiskey.
- Fucking hell, Bill.

06:35.103 --> 06:39.314
- I feel like a teenage tantric Superman.
- Yeah, so do I.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.274
Bill:
I'm a simple person.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.985
I like to reconnect
to the essentials.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.489
Go on.
Come on.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.616
Come on, Eric,
you're strong,

06:49.826 --> 06:51.284
you big-boned bastard.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.245
This is like tempered steel.
Come on.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.038
You do it to me,
then I'll do it to you.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.165
- Come on!
- Eric: Bad-tempered steel.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.418
Come on, Eric,
I'll let you have a go.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.295
- Come on, then.
- Let's have it.

07:02.505 --> 07:06.716
(all laughing)

07:06.926 --> 07:08.718
- Looks like a crossover.
- Go on, take a dig.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.179
- Take a fucking dig, Eric!
- Feel that.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.266
- It's soft as shite.
- Oh, you bastard!

07:14.475 --> 07:17.477
I forgot to pick
the kids up.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.647
- Bill: Oh, a man out of time.
- Shit.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.607
- Eric: What's happened?
- (phone vibrating)

07:22.817 --> 07:24.359
Oh, that's them
outside now.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.153
I'd better go.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.615
Bill:
Who's out there?

07:30.825 --> 07:33.034
- Karl: It's his missus.
- Bill: Is she coming in?

07:33.244 --> 07:34.536
No no no.
I'd better go.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.121
I gotta feed the kids
and that, but...

07:36.330 --> 07:37.914
Is that Helen?
I ain't seen her in years.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.499
Yeah yeah.
We gotta go.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.501
Well, uh, nice one.
Well done and everything.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.128
- Yeah, well done.
- Cheers, Garv.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.005
Yeah, see you later.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.882
See you, Maggie.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.469
See you, everyone.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.596
Cheers, Garv.
Have a good one, mate.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.431
She looks
absolutely furious.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.475
Bill: Give 'em a kiss
for me, Garv.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.810
Eric: She's fit...
his missus, mate.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.522
- Hoo-hoo.
- Karl: That's his old missus.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.650
His new missus is like
a hippo-croco-pig.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.945
(all chuckling)

08:09.155 --> 08:12.908
- Eric: A bit shortsighted.
- Looks a bit like him in a lady mirror.

08:13.117 --> 08:17.662
Bill: A female version of Garvey.
Can you imagine it?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.956
Give us one of those beers.
Oh, these are from Garvey.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.584
- Good old Garvin, eh?
- Bill: Yeah, cheers.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.962
- What a little superstar.
- Eric: He's shaken 'em up, hasn't he?

08:26.172 --> 08:29.090
He's totally fucking
depth-charged me.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.844
Why don't you just pour it
over the carpet?

08:33.054 --> 08:36.264
- (urinating)
- Karl. Oi.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.017
- Yeah? Hello, mate.
- Come here, I've got something to show you.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.312
- Hold on a second.
- By the way, when are you coming back to work?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.356
Soon. Just got to be
a bit careful, that's all.

08:44.565 --> 08:45.982
Well, you need
to hurry up.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.651
I'm running round
like a blue-ass fly.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.861
This thing don't
run itself, you know?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.988
- Everything's going all right though, yeah?
- Yeah.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.407
A bit of trouble in Whitehawk,
but otherwise shway shway.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.368
- Sweet.
- Come on out.

08:56.577 --> 08:59.287
I've got something
to show you.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.540
You are coming back
to work, aren't you?

09:01.749 --> 09:04.626
- Yeah, I told you. I'm coming in.
- (toilet flushes)

09:04.835 --> 09:08.338
So I don't have to run this whole
bloody operation by myself.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.840
Get in there. I've got something
to show you.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.093
- They're not gonna come up, are they?
- Doubt it.

09:13.302 --> 09:17.514
Oh, fucking hell! It's gone right through
the lining on my jacket.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.392
- What's that, Eric?
- A fucking gun, mate.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.310
- Got it off Don the Gun.
- Fuck off.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.437
That looks
totally real, man.

09:24.647 --> 09:28.525
(laughs) It is fucking totally real.
What are you talking about?

09:28.734 --> 09:30.569
- You serious?
- It's a real gun, yeah.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.780
- I just bought it for 200 quid.
- (gun clicking)

09:35.616 --> 09:37.492
Are you serious?
This is a real shooter?

09:37.702 --> 09:39.327
Yeah, it's a real shooter.
I just bought it.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.372
I just told you.
I need it, don't I?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.876
- What, you never seen a fucking gun before?
- Eric, Eric,

09:47.086 --> 09:48.628
are you out of your
fucking mind, mate?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.380
What?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.592
- Put it away and take it home.
- All right, all right.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.719
Well, he's not going
to see it, is he?

09:55.928 --> 09:58.138
I've just got my... I've just got
my prints all over a gun.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.390
Oh, for fuck's sake.
What are you, paranoid or what?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.684
What do you mean?
I've just come back from court.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.103
- (sniffing)
- (laughing) Oh, for Christ's sake, mate.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.731
- What's up with you?
- Has this been fired?

10:07.940 --> 10:10.150
Don't know.
Didn't ask.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.985
- Mate...
- (fabric rubbing)

10:12.194 --> 10:14.112
Look, give it to me.
I'll do that.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.698
- Come on...
- No, I'll do it. Thanks very much, Eric.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.951
It don't mean the old Bill
are going to come

10:20.161 --> 10:22.162
straight round now,
are they?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.959
Put it away.
I don't want to see it again.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.754
(laughing)

10:30.963 --> 10:33.423
Was he always such
an unctuous little prick...

10:33.633 --> 10:35.467
fucking Garvey?

10:35.676 --> 10:38.178
I'll say he's pretty consistent.
Why?

10:38.387 --> 10:40.972
I can't believe the old man's left him
running that fucking club.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.682
He's making
a fortune, man.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.726
I mean, he's just moved
into some flash new drum.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.020
Well, that should have
me and you on it.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.147
What can you say?
Bill is Bill.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.233
- How's he holding up?
- A bit rattled, I'd say.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.444
- Minor.
- What about you?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.864
Fine. I'm just trying
not to think about it.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.616
You know I'm right
behind you, don't you?

10:59.825 --> 11:01.785
(laughs)
What, leading from the rear, yeah?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.620
(laughing)

11:03.829 --> 11:06.289
I've got
your back, mate.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.086
Where's Garvey?

11:13.923 --> 11:15.715
If Benson had testified...

11:15.925 --> 11:17.759
(humming)

11:17.968 --> 11:19.761
It's all right, mate.
Calm down.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.846
It's all sorted.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.140
There you go.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.685
Oh, hang on. Here.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.938
- All right. Thanks, Karl.
- How you holding up?

11:35.611 --> 11:39.239
Well, they've shown their hand now,
haven't they?

11:39.448 --> 11:41.241
Yeah, we're home and dry
now though, right?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.993
(sighs)
Are we?

11:44.203 --> 11:46.746
I feel like I've been fighting this corner
forever, mate.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.000
40 years...
not a bad run.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.797
Oh, it was a run, was it?

11:56.006 --> 11:58.091
I mean, I was a smoker.

11:58.300 --> 12:02.011
I mean, I was a...
I was an artist, a poet.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.390
- The head.
- I was a head, you know.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.393
And I said I would do it.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.019
I started doing it

12:10.229 --> 12:13.314
and I could have
as much gear as I wanted,

12:13.524 --> 12:14.899
which was all
I was interested in.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.901
The funny thing was...
this is what I noticed

12:17.111 --> 12:19.154
first of all
when I got into it...

12:19.363 --> 12:23.825
was everybody else was into
making money, except me.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.619
I mean, me and Timothy Leary,
you know.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.373
I believed that this was a revolution
of consciousness

12:30.583 --> 12:33.251
and there was gonna be
an evolution taking place.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.712
And we were gonna find out
all these discoveries

12:35.921 --> 12:38.673
about the brain
and the future

12:38.883 --> 12:41.426
and how to be high
and stay high

12:41.635 --> 12:46.097
and how to be magical, how to live
in the world in this sort of new way.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.558
But all these other characters
basically were into bread.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.895
They made money and I
ended up just becoming

12:52.104 --> 12:54.439
just another criminal like them
because of force majeure.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.524
Because of Maggie and then
you and the rest of it,

12:56.734 --> 12:58.485
I had to do something.

12:58.694 --> 12:59.736
You know?

12:59.945 --> 13:02.280
Studied the "Tibetan
Book of the Dead."

13:02.490 --> 13:05.241
I learned how to control
my consciousness when I got into acid.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.659
I knew how to sort of...

13:06.869 --> 13:08.745
I did the full lotus,

13:08.954 --> 13:11.539
where you can get into
that little pyramid shape.

13:11.749 --> 13:15.668
And then it all starts to unfold,
you know, and curl up.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.172
It goes out the top of your head
and there you are, man.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.508
And you're like,
"Hey, I'm God.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.302
I am all men.
I can be Everyman.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.388
I'm no better,
no worse...

13:27.598 --> 13:29.724
certainly no worse than anyone else
in the world.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.560
I am Man.
I am Adam Kadmon."

13:32.770 --> 13:36.397
Three things... that's what I found
at the top level.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.441
You know what?
It's a triangle.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.611
It's goodness,
truth and beauty.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.155
And if things
aren't good,

13:44.365 --> 13:46.241
they're not true
and they're not beautiful.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.868
If it's good, it's also true
and beautiful.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.495
And that was the aim...

13:50.704 --> 13:55.291
to get that little triangle
in your forehead

13:55.501 --> 13:58.795
so you could see through
that lens of goodness, truth and beauty,

13:59.004 --> 14:02.173
and see the goodness and see
the truth and see the beauty.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.717
I've just become some sort of,
you know, grim recluse

14:04.927 --> 14:06.344
living in my diamond cave.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.931
There were good drugs
to start with,

14:10.140 --> 14:11.558
and then the freak-out
of the laws

14:11.767 --> 14:13.184
and the paranoia began.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.853
And everybody
splintered off

14:15.062 --> 14:17.188
and went into their rooms
and closed their curtains.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.483
And the communities
were all closed off from one another

14:20.693 --> 14:22.402
so nobody knew
what anybody else was doing.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.987
Everybody else
was just paranoid.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.949
You're only as good
as the people you're with.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.536
Yeah, I know.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.582
- (door opens)
- Eric: Okay, lads,

14:35.791 --> 14:38.001
double bubbles all round.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.461
Yeah.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.701
What are we gonna
do then, Bill?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.704
Well, we're gonna find out
who's behind all this.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.915
(blues music playing)

15:22.963 --> 15:26.716
♪ She is the little
queen of spades ♪

15:26.926 --> 15:30.094
♪ And the men will not
let her be ♪

15:33.974 --> 15:37.477
♪ Hmm, she's the little
queen of spades ♪

15:37.686 --> 15:40.813
♪ And the men will not
let her be ♪

15:44.944 --> 15:47.278
♪ Every time she makes
a spread ♪

15:47.488 --> 15:52.033
♪ Hoo, fair brown, cold chill
just runs all over me. ♪

15:58.540 --> 16:01.167
- Oh, all right. How you doing?
- All right, Bill?

16:01.377 --> 16:03.211
Good result, eh?

16:03.420 --> 16:05.171
What's the point of you
being on the inside

16:05.381 --> 16:07.131
when you don't
help us out, Dave?

16:07.341 --> 16:10.009
I'm only
a counselor, Bill.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.887
Look, I done
all I could.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.014
You've been
well lucky this time.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.600
Have we?
It doesn't feel like we have.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.354
So have you any idea
where all this has come from?

16:21.563 --> 16:23.773
Nobody specific.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.984
But it's someone close in.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.819
You don't get paid
to speculate, David.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.320
You get paid
for intelligence.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.614
The police have got
this document.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.660
I've told you, it's like a family tree
with it all mapped out.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.954
And it's well
comprehensive, Bill.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.081
All kinds of people
are on it, mate.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.834
It goes right back
to your grandfather.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.211
It's basically
the complete fucking picture.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.546
I doubt that.

16:46.755 --> 16:50.091
The Barneses,
the Cowells,

16:50.300 --> 16:52.176
the Pikes...
they're all on it, mate.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.012
All their marriages
back and forth.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.555
Well, that's all
public knowledge.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.056
So? What can they prove?

16:57.266 --> 16:59.726
They don't have to
prove anything, do they?

16:59.935 --> 17:01.936
Listen to me, Bill.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.938
They've just got
to look at you

17:04.147 --> 17:05.732
and eventually
something happens.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.316
They know
it'll balance out.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.278
Well, maybe they need
balancing out.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.531
In the next life, yeah.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.367
(blues music playing)

17:48.108 --> 17:51.444
- (music continues)
- Oh, lovely.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.034
Fuck!

18:04.166 --> 18:06.375
- (water boiling)
- (retching)

18:06.585 --> 18:08.878
- Give me a minute, that's all.
- Okay.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.840
(sighs)
My God.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.675
You've put on a bit of weight,
ain't you?

18:14.885 --> 18:16.636
For God's sake,
Bill, she's...

18:16.845 --> 18:18.638
- You're gonna be a granddad, Bill.
- What?!

18:18.847 --> 18:21.808
I've heard of sudden death,
but sudden birth?

18:22.017 --> 18:24.894
Where's all this
come from, Karl?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.105
Just...

18:40.619 --> 18:43.037
When were you
gonna tell me?

18:43.247 --> 18:45.039
I'm telling you now.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.125
My dad's downstairs.
My mom is downstairs.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.627
He's fucking loving it.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.922
I'm never... I'm never gonna
hear the end of this. This is...

18:53.132 --> 18:56.801
- I don't think your dad is the biggest problem here.
- Oh, come off it.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.053
(sighs)

18:59.263 --> 19:01.264
Just give me a second.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.227
This is quite a number.
This...

19:14.736 --> 19:17.446
I must be going
through a bad phase.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.410
Maybe a baby's the thing
to pull me out of it.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.538
I don't know.
Who fucking knows?

19:27.624 --> 19:30.960
Or this kid's
gonna make it...

19:31.170 --> 19:32.962
this kid's gonna
make it worse.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.174
How does he know this one?
I get confused.

19:36.383 --> 19:39.594
- They was pen pals last time he was in prison.
- (scoffs)

19:39.803 --> 19:41.929
How do you go to prison
for assault

19:42.139 --> 19:43.931
when you're the one
that's assaulted?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.100
Well, you know,

19:46.310 --> 19:48.978
it was that
unreasonable force thing.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.689
That other lad's
still not right.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.276
- He's not ready.
- What's that, Granddad?

19:55.485 --> 19:57.653
Granddad to a bastard.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.740
- Is there a word for that?
- Cunt.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.342
Those letters you wrote me in prison
were really nice.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.178
Good.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.013
I've got some...

20:24.223 --> 20:26.015
I've got some
just here.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.101
- You can do a live reading.
- (laughs) Okay.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.029
They were just here.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.448
- Doesn't matter.
- Fuck.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.910
They were just
fucking here.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.454
- It's okay. It doesn't matter.
- It's... it's not okay.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.665
Somebody's moved them.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.585
Where the fuck are they?

20:54.795 --> 20:57.255
They were just fucking here.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.550
Oh, for fuck's sake!

21:01.760 --> 21:04.971
- Fuck!
- There's some letters down here.

21:05.180 --> 21:08.683
- They might be down here.
- They're not down... they were fucking here, man!

21:08.892 --> 21:11.602
- It's okay.
- It's not okay, it's fucked!

21:11.812 --> 21:16.023
It's fucking typical.
It's fucking fucked right up.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.780
Mom!

21:23.991 --> 21:25.992
Mom...

21:32.207 --> 21:36.127
Mom! Mom!

21:36.336 --> 21:38.671
Mom, have you seen
those letters?

21:38.880 --> 21:42.800
- Calm down. It's okay.
- It's not okay!

21:43.844 --> 21:45.845
Oh, there they are.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.642
I never knew you liked
reading so much.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.270
This is all just shit
we sell on eBay.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.272
Oh, I see.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.316
Do you like Hitler?

21:58.525 --> 22:01.402
A rare book
about him here.

22:01.611 --> 22:05.031
That's Hitler's dog,
Blondie,

22:05.240 --> 22:07.116
the Alsatian.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.327
Got poisoned.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.956
Not really his fault,
but there you go.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.375
That's war.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.464
- Oh, to you, son.
- Cheers, Dad.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.675
I was thinking it's gonna be really nice
out there when you paint that room.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.427
Yeah, it'll be lovely.
Come on, baby.

22:26.636 --> 22:27.845
And maybe while
you're doing it,

22:28.055 --> 22:29.513
you could think about
doing in here.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.640
Yeah, no, absolutely.
Yeah, sure.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.809
- Would you like a whiskey, Valda?
- I'm pregnant.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.519
Thanks anyway, Bill.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.521
Oh well, I suppose
it's about time

22:37.731 --> 22:39.148
we did pair off, isn't it?

22:39.358 --> 22:41.192
- How old are you now?
- 27.

22:41.401 --> 22:45.446
- Ah. And how old are you now, Karl?
- 34.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.157
- Come on.
- Anyway, see you later.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.368
Yeah.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.954
Valda:
Bye, sweetie.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.792
So... bye.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.045
The trap slams shut.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.299
How do you know
it's your kid?

23:05.509 --> 23:06.926
Fucking hell, Dad.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.803
You don't wanna find
yourself bringing up

23:09.012 --> 23:11.013
some other bloke's bastard.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.017
Oh, f...

23:15.227 --> 23:17.228
It's so typical.

23:17.437 --> 23:20.189
Why do you have to be
so fucking negative?

23:22.609 --> 23:25.194
- You are my fucking son.
- No, fuck you!

23:25.404 --> 23:27.822
- You're lazy. You're a fucking bastard.
- Fuck you!

23:28.031 --> 23:30.574
Bill: You don't know who the fuck she is
or where she's come from.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.411
I went out with her for a year, Dad!
I know who she is.

23:33.620 --> 23:36.122
- What else might she be keeping from us?
- That's fucking bullshit.

23:36.331 --> 23:38.040
This is a critical period
at the moment.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.043
I won't let you fuck it up
with this baby bullshit.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.839
- What the fuck has it got to do with you anyway?
- Tell her to get rid of it.

23:45.048 --> 23:49.051
- Oh!
- Bill, it's too late for that.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.513
- You've upset your mother now.
- Maggie: Get in here.

intuition about it?

24:31.052 --> 24:32.595
Well, you know,
I'm not really involved

24:32.804 --> 24:34.680
in that anymore...
sort of thing, Bill.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.557
I'm kept pretty busy
at the club, you know.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.934
I've got kids and that.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.605
And to be honest with you,
I don't feel as comfortable with it physically

24:42.814 --> 24:44.440
as when I was a bit younger.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.942
You're getting fat. You don't
need to make excuses, mate.

24:47.152 --> 24:50.613
- All right, yeah.
- You know?

24:50.822 --> 24:54.700
You and my dad used to be proper terrors,
didn't you, back in the day?

24:54.910 --> 24:57.578
Your dad was one
of my best mates.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.915
In fact, he was
my closest friend.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.375
Yeah. I mean, your dad was...
I would say your dad

25:03.585 --> 25:06.712
was the smartest
and the funniest man in town.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.297
He was the one to beat.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.133
- I miss him quite a lot.
- We all miss him.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.970
What happened to your old man
was... was terrible.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.514
I never got over it really.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.183
I'm still sick inside about that.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.644
You know I think he was murdered,
don't you?

25:21.853 --> 25:23.729
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:23.939 --> 25:27.024
- I thought it was just a fire.
- Well, yeah.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.777
I sometimes think
I should avenge his death.

25:29.986 --> 25:31.529
That's what I'm supposed
to do as the son.

25:31.738 --> 25:35.491
But is that bad that
I just don't want to?

25:35.700 --> 25:37.451
Well, it's all
changed now, isn't it?

25:37.661 --> 25:39.870
There are no fathers left,
or hardly any fathers.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.666
All these fucking slags
living off the state like fucking parasites,

25:43.875 --> 25:45.793
leaving all the men
in fucking rooms.

25:46.002 --> 25:49.004
- So where are the fathers to avenge?
- Yeah.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.131
It's all gone, mate.
You know what I mean?

25:51.341 --> 25:55.177
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But still...

25:55.387 --> 25:57.513
- No, you're doing all right, you know?
- Yeah.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.432
I mean, you were lucky
because you had a dad

26:00.642 --> 26:02.393
that was, you know...
it was okay.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.978
I had him
for a bit, yeah.

26:04.187 --> 26:06.564
I mean, my fucking old man...
he died in his bed

26:06.773 --> 26:09.358
and let me find him naked
and dead when I was 13.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.694
Bloody hell.
That's terrible, Bill.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.196
I'm still sick inside.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.365
Never got over that.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.117
- What a bastard.
- Yeah.

26:18.326 --> 26:20.494
That's what dads do...
they die.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.496
- You know?
- Yeah.

26:22.706 --> 26:26.625
Well, anyway, I'll keep my ear out
about what happened.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.210
Lots of people come
through the club.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.337
Someone might
say something.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.214
Well, if you hear
anything, mate,

26:32.424 --> 26:34.091
just let Karl know...

26:34.301 --> 26:38.137
- Of course, yeah.
...and I'll hear it.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.931
- You're all right, son. You're all right.
- Cheers, Bill.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.142
- Cheers.
- Yeah, no worries.

26:48.898 --> 26:51.066
Cheers, Bill.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.901
- Cheers, mate.
- Thanks a lot.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.612
Cheers.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.662
Garvey.

27:03.872 --> 27:07.249
Garvey?
That's left of field.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.418
I don't like him...
never did.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.838
He's too nice.
It's a weakness.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.049
Being nice
is a weakness?

27:15.258 --> 27:17.176
Don't be sentimental.

27:17.385 --> 27:20.262
Who has the most to gain
by you going to prison?

27:20.472 --> 27:22.848
There's a lot of people
who would gain.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.059
I don't trust him.

27:25.268 --> 27:26.894
Didn't trust his father either,

27:27.103 --> 27:29.313
and we know how that turned out.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.315
Yeah, point taken.

27:31.524 --> 27:33.984
It's him and his wife

27:34.194 --> 27:37.363
and his kids.

27:37.572 --> 27:41.408
The police love to get their claws
into idiots like that.

27:41.618 --> 27:44.328
Oh, Garvey's all right.

27:44.537 --> 27:46.163
Based on what?

27:46.373 --> 27:48.624
Well, you know, my instincts.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.959
Yeah well, that's bullshit.

27:58.718 --> 28:01.470
Karl: We quite like
the name Enoch

28:01.680 --> 28:04.223
or Norbert.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.141
Norbert?

28:06.351 --> 28:07.768
- It's all right.
- Look...

28:07.977 --> 28:09.603
Unusual...
it's an unusual name.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.814
It's medieval apparently.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.692
- Bill is a good strong name.
- Bill?

28:14.901 --> 28:18.028
Oh yeah, like,
no prejudice. Sure.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.947
I don't know how Valda
would feel about that,

28:20.156 --> 28:22.157
but I'm having a feeling
though that she probably

28:22.367 --> 28:24.576
wouldn't like the idea
very much at all.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.663
- Or Billina for a girl.
- Billina's not even a name.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.873
Check the book. It's not in there.
I guarantee it.

28:30.083 --> 28:34.128
I think you'll find the feminine version
of William is...

28:34.337 --> 28:36.088
- It's Wilhelmina.
- Wilhelmina.

28:36.297 --> 28:41.176
So it could be Billelmina,
or short... Billina.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.472
How come there's no pictures
of me in this album?

28:45.682 --> 28:49.435
This is 1979. I should be all
over this album.

28:49.644 --> 28:51.895
I've told you
a million times...

28:52.105 --> 28:53.564
photos were expensive
in those days.

28:53.773 --> 28:56.024
Now hang on a second.
There's loads of pictures.

28:56.234 --> 28:59.778
There's loads of pictures of you two,
of this dog that I don't remember.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.989
And then...

29:04.492 --> 29:06.618
I think that's my foot.

29:08.037 --> 29:11.457
I never took any photos.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.792
Well, somebody took
a lot of pictures.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.545
It wasn't me.

29:16.755 --> 29:21.967
(vocalizing)

29:27.015 --> 29:30.350
- ♪ Are you going to... ♪
- Is that my Gibson?

29:30.560 --> 29:33.645
♪ Are you going ♪

29:33.855 --> 29:36.774
♪ To Scarborough Fair? ♪

29:36.983 --> 29:39.443
That guitar's worth
more than you are.

29:39.652 --> 29:42.529
It's not a fucking Gibson!

29:42.739 --> 29:45.949
Jesus, I gotta fucking listen to you play, like,
night and fucking day

29:46.159 --> 29:48.160
the whole time with
your pals and whatnot.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.704
- Why don't you learn some chords?
- (stuttering)

29:50.914 --> 29:53.415
(playing chords)

29:53.625 --> 29:55.793
I mean somewhere else.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.054
- Hey, Karl.
- Hi, Chris.

30:07.263 --> 30:08.847
- You all right?
- How's tricks?

30:09.057 --> 30:11.225
- Come in.
- Not too bad, mate. Not too bad.

30:11.434 --> 30:14.102
- Good to see you two out and about, anyway.
- Can you close the door?

30:14.312 --> 30:17.648
Hello. Hello.
How are you?

30:17.857 --> 30:19.608
- Oop!
- Where are we? In here?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.360
- Out the back.
- All right.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.695
I'll leave this pram here in the hall.
Is that all right?

30:23.905 --> 30:25.823
Karl: It's Chris Pringle.
Yeah, that's fine, mate.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.825
It'll be safe enough,
won't it?

30:28.034 --> 30:29.868
- Karl: There you go.
- Bill: Hello, Mr. Pringle.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.912
- How you doing? You all right?
- Bill: Yeah yeah.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.330
Good to see you two
out and about.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.083
- I want Grandpappy.
- All right, sweetheart.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.627
Grandpa.
(babbling)

30:38.837 --> 30:40.796
- Lovely, isn't he?
- Karl: Good boy.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.882
- Grandpa, Grandpa.
- Bill: How old's your boy now?

30:44.092 --> 30:48.095
Um... three.

30:48.304 --> 30:51.849
Ah, that's a nice age.

30:52.058 --> 30:55.394
- Had his first fight the other day.
- Bill: Yeah?

30:55.603 --> 30:57.271
- He's an indi...
- A little snapper.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.106
He's an individual, is he?
Like his dad?

30:59.315 --> 31:01.608
Yeah, twatted this kid
with a xylophone.

31:01.818 --> 31:03.110
- It was brilliant.
- Really?

31:03.319 --> 31:04.653
Yeah yeah yeah.
So I'll show you that.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.822
He twats him
with a xylophone

31:07.031 --> 31:09.533
and I'd taught him the two fingers
into the throat routine, right?

31:09.742 --> 31:11.660
So I'd seen his eyes go...
'cause he's got his dad's eyes.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.871
The next minute, he's across the table
with a finger in...

31:14.080 --> 31:16.039
"No!"
Pulls him back.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.667
He's at him like he's a fucking junior ninja.
So they pulled him back.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.961
I sees the look in the teacher's eyes, man.
He shat himself.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.130
- A brick in his underpants.
- Karl: Oi, Chris...

31:23.339 --> 31:25.048
Chris, he looks
just like you.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.758
Of course
he fucking does.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.343
Karl: Yeah,
come on then, Kurt.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.803
Do you want to help me
make the tea?

31:30.013 --> 31:31.722
When I was out
in Bosnia, you know...

31:31.931 --> 31:33.557
well, actually I went down
to have a holiday

31:33.766 --> 31:35.601
and ended up just having
a go in the war.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.686
- Cheap beer.
- Karl: Were you in the army, Chris?

31:37.896 --> 31:40.522
Which one?
Floated about.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.358
Don't fight for no king,
no country... no queen, no country.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.153
- I'm my own principality. Know what I'm saying?
- Bill: Amen.

31:46.362 --> 31:47.863
Yeah. Amen.
Testify, brother.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.698
- You know the truth.
- Passport to Pringle.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.700
- Huh?
- Passport to Pringle.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.953
- (laughing) What does that mean?
- Oh.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.956
- Bill: So I'm standing there in the court...
- (blowing raspberries)

31:58.166 --> 31:59.833
- (Kurt giggling)
...and all of a sudden...

32:00.043 --> 32:01.418
Less of that bit,
will you?

32:01.628 --> 32:03.128
- Sorry?
- Less of that.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.255
I don't mind the cuddling,
but none of the kissing

32:05.465 --> 32:08.467
and farting noises,
all right?

32:08.676 --> 32:10.469
Just stay
where I can see you.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.512
Play up and down the hall if you want.
That's fine.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.974
But don't be taking him
into your other room or anything.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.476
- (cooing)
- (laughing)

32:17.685 --> 32:19.853
Listen, if youse boys
need anything done,

32:20.063 --> 32:22.439
just give me a shout,
won't you?

32:22.649 --> 32:25.984
- So...
- Hmm?

32:26.194 --> 32:30.197
- (whacking)
- Oh, of course. Don't worry.

32:30.406 --> 32:33.075
Got the car out the back...
hatchback.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.118
A roll of carpet,
gaffer tape,

32:35.328 --> 32:36.995
lump hammer...
it's all there.

32:37.205 --> 32:40.248
Good to go.
Shovel, small handle.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.459
Give me 15 minutes...
boom, South Downs.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.087
- Good boy.
- All right?

32:45.296 --> 32:47.047
Modern life
these days, you see?

32:47.256 --> 32:49.466
- You gotta market.
- Bill: You got a point there, Chris.

32:49.676 --> 32:52.511
- Have you got a web presence?
- Not yet.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.721
Listen, catch youse later,
all right?

32:54.931 --> 32:57.391
Nice to see you.
Keep it...

32:57.600 --> 32:59.518
- keep it tight.
- Have a good one.

32:59.727 --> 33:02.562
- Nice to see your kid as well, man.
- He's lovely, isn't he?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.147
He took to you,
didn't he?

33:04.357 --> 33:06.149
Come on.
Come on, sweetheart.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.777
- You gonna go with your dad?
- Is he up the stairs?

33:11.823 --> 33:14.157
I was thinking about
having Valda round,

33:14.367 --> 33:15.659
having a bit of dinner.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.160
I suppose.
Maggie?

33:17.370 --> 33:19.538
I haven't got much in.

33:19.747 --> 33:22.457
I'll cook it.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.669
Yeah, fine.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.841
- Bill: Karl.
- Yeah?

33:31.050 --> 33:32.801
Look at this glass
you've just given me.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.469
Karl:
Say again?

33:34.679 --> 33:36.847
Well, I'm not going
to say anything.

33:37.056 --> 33:39.891
Would you mind
having a look at that?

33:40.101 --> 33:41.601
It's fine.

33:43.396 --> 33:46.481
You know, this is the first time
I've come over for dinner.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.818
Really? Hmm.
That was rude of us.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.404
Bill: How long did you go out together?
About three weeks?

33:52.613 --> 33:55.240
- A year.
- A year?

33:55.450 --> 33:56.742
Is that right, Maggie?

33:56.951 --> 33:59.369
- Was it that long?
- A year.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.247
Oh, yeah. Well, what do you
see in him then?

34:02.457 --> 34:04.082
What do you mean?
There's lots to see in him.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.585
Dad, just...
Please, Dad, just...

34:06.794 --> 34:08.962
It's not an interrogation, yeah?
It's just...

34:11.007 --> 34:13.132
(Valda clears throat)

34:13.342 --> 34:14.842
To happy families,
all right?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.969
Tonight at least.
Happy families.

34:17.179 --> 34:19.014
- Happy families.
- Bill: All right, okay.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.600
- All: Happy families.
- Cheers, everyone. Cheers, Mom.

34:21.809 --> 34:23.393
Valda:
Do you need a hand?

34:23.603 --> 34:25.478
Oh, fuck.
Shit, fuck.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.688
Valda: I don't really see
my parents much anymore.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.900
- Bill: Oh, why's that?
- Personal reasons.

34:31.110 --> 34:34.862
Ma, have we got a...
a thing for the pasta?

34:35.072 --> 34:36.447
Oh, it's all right.
I found it.

34:36.657 --> 34:37.949
Valda:
So he does a lot of cooking

34:38.159 --> 34:39.826
around here then,
Bill?

34:40.036 --> 34:41.369
- No. He hardly ever cooks.
- Shit.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.496
He's only cooking
because you're here.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.500
Valda: It's very nice of him
to make the effort, isn't it?

34:46.708 --> 34:48.960
Well, he can be
a good lad, yeah.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.170
He's all right really.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.005
Maggie:
Only the best tonight.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.050
Do you know what this
is called, this pattern?

34:55.259 --> 34:58.136
- Is it the willow?
- Yeah, it's the willow pattern.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.972
It's a story about
runaway lovers, isn't it?

35:01.182 --> 35:02.766
Going over the bridge,
I think.

35:02.975 --> 35:05.018
Is that right?

35:05.228 --> 35:07.104
- Did they have a happy ending?
- I don't think so.

35:07.313 --> 35:09.356
Oh, I think that's
what the birds are.

35:09.565 --> 35:13.026
I think maybe that's the souls of the lovers
after they've been murdered.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.362
Karl:
What it is, I can tell you,

35:15.571 --> 35:21.034
is the lovers...

35:21.244 --> 35:26.248
got chased
over the bridge by her dad,

35:26.457 --> 35:29.334
who's the fisherman,
and he trapped them on the island

35:29.544 --> 35:31.711
and broke down
the bridge.

35:31.921 --> 35:35.298
They were trapped forever, but then
they turned into birds and they were free.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.009
- He's a fountain of knowledge, isn't he?
- I never knew that.

35:38.219 --> 35:41.763
- Had those since our wedding... never knew.
- Bill: Ah.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.391
- Maggie: Lovely.
- Valda: Mm, you win 20p.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.351
Karl:
A bit of salad there, Mom?

35:46.561 --> 35:50.021
Bill: Well, I can't say
that you're not pretty.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.274
- There he goes, the charmer.
- Valda: Thanks.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.776
- (laughs) Yeah.
- Maggie: Aren't you?

35:54.986 --> 35:58.780
Well, you know,
if I was 20 years younger...

35:58.990 --> 36:01.950
- Maggie: He was a devil.
- Karl: It's more like 35 years younger, Dad.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.786
Oh, all right,
35 years.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.789
(laughter)

36:07.999 --> 36:09.416
When he had hair.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.626
Karl, could you get me
some water, please?

36:12.753 --> 36:14.921
Thank you.

36:15.131 --> 36:18.341
I think your problem is you don't give Karl
enough credit.

36:19.385 --> 36:20.760
That's not true.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.889
Well, if I'm honest,
I think you bully him.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.724
You just pick at him
all the time.

36:25.933 --> 36:29.186
Pick pick pick.
You just get at him all the time.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.897
Look, it's banter. You don't understand
how this house works.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.440
I think I do.

36:33.649 --> 36:35.817
- Is she always this mouthy?
- Karl: What?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.903
Maggie: We can't all be
Father Christmas, can we?

36:38.112 --> 36:41.865
- I'm just being myself, Karl, don't worry.
- Girls like you...

36:42.074 --> 36:43.909
- pregnant...
- Dad.

36:44.118 --> 36:45.410
I bet you don't
even know who by.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.953
Karl, are you going
to say anything?

36:47.163 --> 36:48.538
- Karl: Dad...
- Bill: Look...

36:48.748 --> 36:50.415
Dad, Dad!

36:50.625 --> 36:53.210
Look, if she says it's mine,
it's mine, all right?

36:53.419 --> 36:55.503
Mom...

36:57.256 --> 36:59.299
You should
have known, Karl.

36:59.508 --> 37:01.718
You should have known that
this was not a good idea.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.846
I know, but she's got...
she's got my baby.

37:05.056 --> 37:08.183
I've got a fucking
headache now.

37:08.392 --> 37:11.895
Mom, listen, just...
please, can you just stop him?

37:12.104 --> 37:14.147
- I'll be all right. Get back in there.
- Just help me.

37:14.357 --> 37:17.025
I'll be all right
when I've had a drink.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.319
(sighs)

37:20.446 --> 37:22.739
Beam me up.

37:32.541 --> 37:34.668
Do you want
some help, Karl?

37:34.877 --> 37:37.587
Yeah well, there's a bit of pudding.
I'll bring it in.

37:42.176 --> 37:43.677
I thought there was
some vino coming.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.595
No, I'll bring it in
in a minute, Dad.

37:45.805 --> 37:48.014
Let me get the pudding sorted out,
get it ready to serve.

37:48.224 --> 37:51.142
- Yeah, thanks, Maggie.
- I just wanted to have a look at you.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.771
Yeah. Why was it
you and he split up then?

37:54.981 --> 37:56.940
I don't know.

37:57.149 --> 37:59.067
It just didn't work out.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.320
Quite a lot of temper, fights.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.323
But he seems to have,
you know, mellowed a bit.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.575
Yeah, he's got
a temper on him,

38:07.785 --> 38:09.077
but we're on top
of it now.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.912
He got new pills.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.123
What do you mean?

38:15.293 --> 38:18.461
Well, he has a few mood swings,
doesn't he?

38:18.671 --> 38:22.132
- But he's a lovely lad.
- He's... he is a lovely lad.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.969
- Good night.
- (laughs)

38:26.178 --> 38:29.055
- I'm sorry it was a bit harsh.
- Don't worry about it.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.850
- It was entertaining.
- I'm sorry you didn't like the food.

38:32.059 --> 38:33.727
It was fine.
It was fine.

38:33.936 --> 38:37.105
It was very sweet
that you cooked.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.566
I thought you were, you know,
on good form tonight.

38:39.775 --> 38:41.776
I know.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.871
Okay, I'm gonna go.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.748
- Give me a call.
- I will do.

38:54.957 --> 38:56.249
- I'll see you out.
- Okay.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.127
What a fucking
little imbecile.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.837
Not in front of the boy.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.672
She's a sheep.
She's a follower.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.091
I don't bully him.
It's non-aggressive advice.

39:05.301 --> 39:08.094
Yeah, she's got
her hooks right in.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.221
It's absolutely
typical of him.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.141
- That was good rowdy fun, yeah?
- Oh yeah, oh yeah.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.935
- It was good to see her again.
- Yeah, I'm really glad she's back.

39:16.145 --> 39:19.439
Yeah. She should lay off
the fatuous advice, though.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.608
- You know?
- She was just telling it how she saw it.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.109
Well, I think
she should keep

39:23.319 --> 39:24.861
that internal monologue
to herself

39:25.071 --> 39:26.571
and not share it
with the adults.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.782
I'm playing at devil's advocate
here, Karl,

39:28.991 --> 39:31.576
but she's a bit,
you know, full of herself.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.747
In a nice way, I mean.
Conceited.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.585
I had a nice time.

40:30.511 --> 40:32.554
Garvey'll be around
in a bit.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.891
Hide the fucking pies, yeah?

40:37.101 --> 40:40.353
- Where does your missus think you are?
- Late at the club.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.772
I don't know why
I couldn't tell her what's happening.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.233
I told you, it's so she can't be put
in a position later on.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.652
- And no phones.
- Yeah, I left it at home. Don't worry.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.362
- So what's going on?
- Nothing much.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.197
Just tying up
a few loose ends.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.162
- Was it you?
- What?

40:59.915 --> 41:01.458
Fucking hell!
Are you mental?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.751
I've done... I've done
fuck all to deserve this?

41:03.961 --> 41:06.671
- Calm down.
- What's going on? You lure me out here...

41:06.881 --> 41:08.715
- (keys jingle)
- What's this?

41:17.850 --> 41:20.351
Look, listen, I couldn't get a sitter.
Can we sort this out now?

41:20.561 --> 41:21.978
- Fuck's sake.
- Ears!

41:22.188 --> 41:24.481
Shit, that's Chris Pringle!

41:24.690 --> 41:26.566
Calm down, lad.
It's nothing personal.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.777
- What the fuck's he doing here?
- An impartial observer.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.196
Fuck that!

41:34.533 --> 41:36.826
Come here,
you fat bastard.

41:43.918 --> 41:47.128
- Bill, what's going on?
- Everything's okay, Maggie. Don't worry.

41:47.338 --> 41:50.590
Yeah, it's just a bit
of boisterous fun, Ma.

41:50.799 --> 41:54.552
- Put it through, Bill?
- No, don't break it down. It's Victorian.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.305
So what have... what have youse got here?
Like, you got any tools?

41:57.515 --> 41:59.349
Like a knife?
A knife would be good.

41:59.558 --> 42:01.559
- You didn't bring anything?
- This is amateur hour.

42:01.769 --> 42:04.145
- No, I was in a rush.
- Dude, what the fuck?

42:04.355 --> 42:06.856
- I've got a kid, you know.
- Are you on a fucking... you on a meter?

42:07.066 --> 42:09.234
Even leaving the fucking house
is like a lifestyle choice.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.194
You're like my fucking missus.
(yammering)

42:11.403 --> 42:13.571
I've got the fucking kid.
I've got to go to work with the kid.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.490
Yeah. He's having
a kid as well.

42:15.699 --> 42:18.117
Oh, are you?
You having a kid?

42:18.327 --> 42:20.411
That's brilliant.
Congratulations, son.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.580
Come on,
hug it up, bitch.

42:22.790 --> 42:25.208
- Cheers, Pringle.
- Oh, man.

42:25.417 --> 42:28.169
- Dude, what are we gonna do...
- Look, let's finish this amateur hour.

42:28.379 --> 42:31.756
- Oh, fuck, yeah.
- Keep it down, man. He's in there.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.259
Well, he knows
we're fucking out here.

42:34.468 --> 42:37.428
- Let's flush him out.
- I don't want any...

42:37.638 --> 42:39.305
Come out,
you little fucker.

42:39.515 --> 42:41.140
I'm gonna come in there
and get you.

42:41.350 --> 42:43.560
I'm gonna fuck you up the ass
and set your hair on fire.

42:43.769 --> 42:46.145
- Garvey: Fuck off, Pringle.
- I'm fucking sick of this shit.

42:46.355 --> 42:49.107
A little bit strong.
Come on, he's a mate.

42:49.316 --> 42:51.401
Look, sorry about that.
Sorry, all right?

42:53.946 --> 42:56.531
Would little Kurt like some squash,
Christopher?

42:56.740 --> 42:59.826
- Nothing artificial, Maggie. Thanks, though.
- Oh, okay.

43:00.035 --> 43:02.662
- Are my vitamin supplements ready, Maggie?
- Yeah, come through.

43:02.871 --> 43:04.789
- (knocking)
- Come on, out.

43:04.999 --> 43:08.251
- (cooing)
- Come out, come out, wherever you are.

Mate, it's just
getting silly now.

45:46.869 --> 45:48.953
Garv, I don't know what
you think we're doing, mate,

45:49.163 --> 45:50.496
but you've got it
all wrong.

45:50.706 --> 45:54.083
This has just...
this has just been a test.

45:54.293 --> 45:56.252
I've been nothing
but nice to you lot.

45:56.462 --> 45:59.380
Yeah, Garv, but it's, like,
been a test of character

45:59.590 --> 46:01.591
and you've passed it, mate...
flying colors.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.510
- It's all sweet now.
- Really?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.345
Yeah, come down
and smoke the peace pipe.

46:06.555 --> 46:09.056
We'll forget
all about this.

46:09.266 --> 46:13.352
Garv, I swear
on my unborn kid

46:13.562 --> 46:15.646
we're not going
to do anything.

46:15.856 --> 46:18.733
- Is that fucking animal Pringle out there?
- Pringle's gone, mate.

46:18.942 --> 46:22.195
I don't even know
what he was doing here.

46:22.404 --> 46:24.864
All right,
I'm coming out.

46:27.493 --> 46:29.827
Come on,
you great lump.

46:30.037 --> 46:32.330
We never suspected you
for a minute, mate.

46:32.539 --> 46:34.582
You're getting paranoid
in your old age.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.793
Yeah, you are, Garv.

46:39.421 --> 46:41.380
It's not him, is it?

46:41.590 --> 46:43.090
I don't know.
I'm tired.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.927
He reacted all wrong.
I'm good at reading people.

46:46.136 --> 46:47.595
He made a run for it.

46:47.805 --> 46:50.765
Not an unnatural response
in the circumstances.

46:50.974 --> 46:52.934
No, I'm talking about
your general aura.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.477
You know, he's a clown.
He's a fool.

46:54.686 --> 46:56.687
He's innocent.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.898
All right.

47:00.234 --> 47:02.276
Garv.

47:05.531 --> 47:07.740
- So you having a baby, eh?
- Yep.

47:07.950 --> 47:10.701
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

47:10.911 --> 47:13.329
I was trying for months
with Helen,

47:13.539 --> 47:15.957
but she had a problem
with her uterus.

47:16.166 --> 47:18.251
- Well, I did not know that, Garv.
- I'll tell you what.

47:18.460 --> 47:20.545
I want to ask you
something.

47:20.754 --> 47:22.922
On the night the twins
were conceived

47:23.131 --> 47:24.882
I made this, like,
roaring noise.

47:25.092 --> 47:26.676
I'd never
done that before.

47:26.885 --> 47:29.637
- Did you make a noise?
- Fuck knows.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.722
I don't know, but...

47:31.932 --> 47:34.225
So what's the name
of the lucky mom-to-be?

47:34.434 --> 47:36.727
- Valda.
- Valda.

47:36.937 --> 47:38.980
Valda Newland?

47:40.357 --> 47:41.774
- Why? Do you know her?
- Yeah yeah.

47:41.984 --> 47:44.694
She went out with my brother
a few months ago.

47:44.903 --> 47:47.071
- Really?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

47:47.281 --> 47:49.699
They were pen pals
together.

47:49.908 --> 47:51.325
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

47:51.535 --> 47:54.161
She's had loads
of pen pals from prison.

47:54.371 --> 47:57.290
She's a... she's a lovely girl.
She's got a big heart.

47:57.499 --> 47:59.584
Well done.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.674
I'm painting tomorrow.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.843
- What, in here?
- Yeah, all around.

48:09.052 --> 48:11.220
- What color?
- Just white.

48:11.430 --> 48:13.347
Oh yeah, nice.
Fresh start.

48:13.557 --> 48:16.350
- Can you do me a favor for a second, Garv?
- Yeah, of course.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.645
- Can you just hold this up?
- Right.

48:19.855 --> 48:22.732
- Just there.
- Yeah.

48:22.941 --> 48:24.942
Actually,
I'm pretty knackered.

48:25.152 --> 48:26.777
You couldn't do us a tea,
could you, Karl?

48:26.987 --> 48:28.613
- Yeah, sure.
- What time is it?

48:28.822 --> 48:30.531
I've got
the kids tomorrow.

48:30.741 --> 48:33.451
Ah!

48:33.660 --> 48:35.912
Fuck your kids.

48:39.041 --> 48:41.709
(phone ringing)

48:41.919 --> 48:45.922
Eric, it's Karl.
Yeah.

48:46.131 --> 48:48.716
Any chance you could
possibly pop over?

48:50.761 --> 48:52.887
Yeah, I'm gonna need
your help with something.

48:53.096 --> 48:55.222
Come the back way, yeah?

48:55.432 --> 48:57.892

49:56.034 --> 49:58.244

49:58.453 --> 50:00.913

two-man shovel, is it?

50:03.291 --> 50:05.835
You take your turn,
then I'll take over.

50:06.044 --> 50:08.504
This is bollocks. We'll never get him
into this ground, mate.

50:08.714 --> 50:11.298
- We're just gonna have to leave him.
- We can't fucking leave him.

50:11.508 --> 50:13.217
We'll just have to fucking think of

Yes, there is.
It's fine.

Eric:

50:30.986 --> 50:33.529

Science suggests
it'll be a girl.

51:38.386 --> 51:39.970
Why would it suggest that?

51:40.180 --> 51:43.307
Because the man determines

51:47.646 --> 51:50.898

- What type?

51:51.108 --> 51:52.900
Well, the type
that science talks about.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.611

Pa, that's the door.

52:18.927 --> 52:20.761
- (knocking)
- (sighs)

52:22.347 --> 52:24.723
Oh, fucking hell.
Don't get up.

52:29.312 --> 52:31.188
- All right, Karl.
- All right, Dave.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.274
- I hear you're getting married.
- That's right.

52:33.483 --> 52:37.319
(laughs)
Ducked 10 years and ended up getting life, eh?

52:37.529 --> 52:40.739
- All right, Bill.
- Hello, Dave.

52:40.949 --> 52:43.325
Garvey never went home
last night.

52:43.535 --> 52:45.161
Bill:
Oh, yeah? Is that official?

52:45.370 --> 52:47.663
Yeah. I've had his missus
on the phone to mine.

52:47.873 --> 52:49.957
After one night?
He's on a short leash.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.626
He never goes away,
does he?

52:52.836 --> 52:55.212
So, uh, was he here?

52:55.422 --> 52:59.008
- No.
- Karl: Not seen him.

52:59.217 --> 53:01.010
Well, who was here
last night?

53:01.219 --> 53:03.262
Just... just Pringle.

53:03.471 --> 53:06.098
Fucking hell.
Pringle.

53:06.308 --> 53:08.851
That's non-helpful.

53:09.060 --> 53:12.563
Right well, look,
if you see Garvey,

53:12.772 --> 53:14.064
you get him to give me
a bell, yeah?

53:14.274 --> 53:15.983
- Sure.
- Karl: Sure, will do.

53:16.193 --> 53:18.736
- Yeah, well, I...
- We'll see you later, man.

53:18.945 --> 53:21.155
I just don't want
his missus...

53:21.364 --> 53:24.033
- Bill: Take it easy, Dave.
...scaring up a big search party.

53:25.702 --> 53:27.912
I'll see you later.

53:28.121 --> 53:32.625
- Well, where do you think Garvey is?
- I don't know. He's...

53:35.420 --> 53:36.795
I don't like this.

53:37.005 --> 53:39.590
Do you think Eric's
into much with Garvey?

53:41.009 --> 53:43.260
Eric owes Garvey money.

53:43.470 --> 53:45.679
Quite a bit, knowing Eric.

53:45.889 --> 53:48.766
Why? What's wrong?
What's Eric got to do with it?

53:48.975 --> 53:51.936
Garvey's missing, that's all.
Nothing to worry about.

53:59.444 --> 54:03.322
I think someone must have picked him up
between here and his drum.

54:06.868 --> 54:10.329
- I can't go to prison, man.
- I know.

54:10.538 --> 54:12.539
I'll never come out.

54:22.050 --> 54:23.550
It's a confessional
culture, man.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.135
People just can't
shut up.

54:25.345 --> 54:28.389
Pringle will go then, yeah?

54:28.598 --> 54:31.934
- But who has he told?
- He lives with his mom.

54:32.143 --> 54:34.603
The kid's with
his ex-missus.

54:34.813 --> 54:36.981
It's unlikely he's gonna
say anything germane to her.

54:37.190 --> 54:39.525
Yeah, let's hope not, eh?
What do you think, Bill?

54:39.734 --> 54:42.111
(sighs)
I don't know.

54:42.320 --> 54:44.113
Mags?

54:44.322 --> 54:47.199
Pringle tells his war stories
to whoever'll listen.

54:47.409 --> 54:49.410
The mom's a notorious
chatterbox.

54:49.619 --> 54:51.829
Just to be safe then, yeah?

54:52.038 --> 54:55.332
Okay.
This is on me then, yeah?

54:57.043 --> 54:58.961
I'll deal with Pringle
and his people.

54:59.170 --> 55:01.463
This is turning into
a right fucking massacre.

55:01.673 --> 55:04.341
- Yay.
- What about the kid? He's got a kid.

55:04.551 --> 55:07.094
Yeah, the kid's about two.
He can't even talk, can he?

55:07.304 --> 55:09.179
I mean, what's going
to happen to the kid?

55:09.389 --> 55:11.765
He'll probably end up getting sent
to a decent school.

55:11.975 --> 55:15.728
Would you want Pringle
as your old man?

55:15.937 --> 55:18.022
Can't believe they've brought this
on themselves.

55:18.231 --> 55:20.441
They're so selfish.

55:20.650 --> 55:22.818
Disappearances
and accidents, Eric.

55:23.028 --> 55:24.320
No showboating.

55:24.529 --> 55:28.032
Bill, come on.

55:32.620 --> 55:34.496
Here, Pa.

55:34.706 --> 55:37.207
- Cheers.
- Eric: To Garvey.

55:37.417 --> 55:39.543
All:
Garvey.

55:41.296 --> 55:44.548
- Bill: And Pringle.
- Yeah, and Pringle.

55:44.758 --> 55:47.718
All:
Pringle.

55:47.927 --> 55:50.387
- A shame about his kid.
- Yeah.

55:50.597 --> 55:53.932
Don't think about it.
I'm not.

55:54.142 --> 55:55.934
Still...

55:56.144 --> 55:57.353
that's the way
it goes, isn't it?

55:57.562 --> 55:59.646
A lot of children die.

55:59.856 --> 56:02.191
What time is it?

56:02.400 --> 56:04.276
What, now?

56:04.486 --> 56:07.488
It's about 25 past 4:00.

56:07.697 --> 56:11.241
- Why, have you got an appointment?
- Nah, I was just wondering.

56:16.206 --> 56:19.875
(waves crashing)

56:20.085 --> 56:23.670
- It's just nice to be out of the house.
- Mm.

56:26.007 --> 56:28.133
Sometimes don't you think
you could just walk

56:28.343 --> 56:31.470
straight out into the sea
and never come back?

56:34.516 --> 56:39.645
You're full of cheery little introspective
observations today.

56:39.854 --> 56:42.439
What did you want to be
when you grew up?

56:45.110 --> 56:47.945
Nothing.

56:48.154 --> 56:50.406
How much
do you love me?

57:03.878 --> 57:06.380
Rah!

57:08.299 --> 57:09.591
Eric:
Oi, Pringle.

57:09.801 --> 57:11.552
- You all right, mate?
- How you doing?

57:11.761 --> 57:13.345
- I've got a little job for you.
- Oh, yeah?

57:13.555 --> 57:15.139
- Yeah. You up for it?
- Yeah, nice.

57:15.348 --> 57:17.099
Come on, mate.

57:17.308 --> 57:18.725
Come on, jump in.

57:18.935 --> 57:20.436
It's lovely here, isn't it?

57:20.645 --> 57:22.521
- Stinks of shit, mate.
- Yeah.

57:22.730 --> 57:24.398
But I like those
fresh country smells.

57:24.607 --> 57:28.026
- You know what I mean?
- So what's this all about?

57:28.236 --> 57:30.988
Just gotta see a geezer over here.
Don't worry about it.

57:31.197 --> 57:33.824
- Whereabouts?
- Just over here.

57:34.033 --> 57:37.411
- By this caravan?
- No no, just by the side of the caravan.

57:37.620 --> 57:40.289
Nothing to worry about.
Don't worry.

57:41.958 --> 57:44.376
(laughs)

57:44.586 --> 57:47.004
Aw, come on, man.
What about my son?

57:47.213 --> 57:50.591
Oh, don't fucking cry,
mate. Oi!

57:50.800 --> 57:53.260
Oh, for fuck's sake, where do you think
you're going?

57:58.475 --> 58:00.309
(dog barking)

58:00.518 --> 58:03.395
Twat.

58:12.363 --> 58:17.034
Ma, I'm gonna move out.

58:17.243 --> 58:20.412
I thought Valda
was gonna move in here.

58:20.622 --> 58:23.207
Val wants our own space.
I think she's right.

58:23.416 --> 58:26.335
Well, you'll need help with the baby.
I mean, she looks frail.

58:26.544 --> 58:29.379
I'm having a kid.
I can't go to prison.

58:29.589 --> 58:33.509
Nobody's going to prison
and you're going to do as you're told.

58:35.094 --> 58:36.803
I don't want to do
any of this anymore.

58:37.013 --> 58:39.014
I just want to be a...

58:39.224 --> 58:41.225
I just want to be
a normal dad.

58:44.812 --> 58:46.647
- Mrs. Pringle?
- Yeah?

58:46.856 --> 58:48.482
I'm a friend
of your son's.

58:48.691 --> 58:50.400
Eric, yeah?
You remember me?

58:50.610 --> 58:52.945
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's fine, yeah.

58:53.154 --> 58:55.072
You been shopping?
You bought anything nice?

58:55.281 --> 58:57.032
Oh, just a few bits
for the kids, you know.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.701
- Trying to cut back a bit these days.
- Yeah, times is tight.

58:59.911 --> 59:02.204
- We've all got too much anyway, haven't we?
- That is true.

59:02.413 --> 59:04.790
I can't believe how much he looks
like his old dad.

59:04.999 --> 59:06.792
Yeah, poor little thing, eh?
(laughing)

59:07.001 --> 59:08.961
What time is this bus
coming then?

59:09.170 --> 59:12.339
- (screams)
- (tires screeching)

59:14.759 --> 59:17.594
- And the fat man?
- Oh, he's really shit the bed on this one, mate.

59:17.804 --> 59:20.347
Looked all over for him...
high and low, here and there.

59:20.557 --> 59:22.599
- Yeah?
- Pie shop.

59:22.809 --> 59:26.603
- He's gone.
- Yeah, I thought so. I had a feeling.

59:26.813 --> 59:28.647
- Bill: You want a whiskey?
- Yeah, lovely.

59:28.856 --> 59:31.316
What's going on, you know,
with the business and...

59:31.526 --> 59:33.235
and the club?

59:33.444 --> 59:36.572
Well, looks like I'm gonna need
a new manager, doesn't it?

59:36.781 --> 59:39.575
Yeah, I've been having
a little think about that.

59:39.784 --> 59:41.493
- Cheers.
- Yeah?

59:41.703 --> 59:46.290
Yeah, just, you know,
about who to put in there.

59:46.499 --> 59:48.625
- Yeah.
- And then I thought,

59:48.835 --> 59:50.586
I ran Foxy's, didn't I?

59:50.795 --> 59:52.629
- For 10 years down in Eastbourne.
- Oh, yeah.

59:52.839 --> 59:55.507
We did a great job down there, mate.
Great job.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.384
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.178
- That was a long time ago, Eric.
- I mean me and Karl...

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:03.140
- it would keep us busy.
- Karl's a very busy boy.

01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:07.394
Yeah. No, he's probably too busy,
but I've still got time.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.855
I could help out
down there.

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:13.609
I thought it'd, like,
dovetail with the business.

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:19.615
Yeah. Well, I mean,
obviously I understand

01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:23.535
where you're coming from,
but I'll leave it with you.

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:26.038
Have a little think
about it, mate.

01:00:26.247 --> 01:00:27.998
I'll tell you what,
I'll think about it.

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:31.335
Yeah yeah, nice nice.
Okay. So what?

01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:34.421
I'll call you later maybe,
have a chat?

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:39.343
I mean, it's a good idea...
a good idea, Bill,

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:43.263
because I feel that
the club could be...

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.682
I've got some ideas
for the club,

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.184
strategic ideas.

01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:50.103
(blues music playing)

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.109
Running a club.
(scoffs)

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:01.198
- Helen.
- Where is he?

01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:03.575
- Bill?
- My husband!

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:05.202
How should I know?
I'm cooking.

01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:07.579
- I just want his body!
- Shh, keep it down.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:10.332
- Whatever's left!
- Keep it down, keep it down.

01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:12.459
I don't want him lying
out there in a ditch!

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.628
- Keep it... keep it...
- I won't keep it down!

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:19.174
Getting eaten up by...
by things and foxes, you fuck.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.093
Look, you're under
a lot of stress, Helen.

01:01:21.302 --> 01:01:23.136
I understand it, but it's totally
out of order.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:26.264
You cold bitch.
You're just like your father.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:28.475
- Get out of here.
- You'll end up just like him.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.811
(shouting, banging)

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.479
Unacceptable, Bill.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.899
I told you when we started this...
no drama.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.527
She's a prime candidate
for shock treatment.

01:01:38.736 --> 01:01:42.781
- Nobody is gonna listen to her ravings.
- Not listen?

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.158
I am surprised they didn't hear that
in fucking Kent.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.577
Why'd she start talking
about my dad?

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:50.914
Why'd she have to say that?

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:20.777
Karl: Oh, Jonny.
How you doing, buddy?

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:23.989
(chattering)

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.210
- Jonny.
- Good journey, yeah?

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.338
Not really, no.

01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:43.925
Well, what brings you
all the way down from London, Jon?

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.597
I told Jacob I didn't
want to come down, Bill.

01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:51.183
Well, why didn't
he come down himself?

01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:58.315
Jacob's a little, uh,
disappointed in you, Bill.

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:05.238
A general vibe
of confusion

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:08.283
and carnage coming
from your end.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:12.120
- There's been a few ructions, but it's evening out.
- Is it?

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.039
Because it doesn't
feel that way.

01:03:14.248 --> 01:03:17.375
It feels like it's spiraling
into chaos, Bill.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:20.629
You and your idiot son
in and out of court,

01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:22.255
police sniffing around
everything,

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.674
known associates
doing moonlight flits.

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:27.344
It's the last thing
we fucking need, Bill.

01:03:27.553 --> 01:03:30.764
- Well, agree with me at least!
- All right, I agree.

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.391
I don't think you even know
what problems you have, Bill.

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:37.813
- Will you tell me then?
- I'm not here to explain things, Bill.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:44.820
I'm here symbolically, yeah?

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:49.199
As a reminder that we're all
in this together, yeah?

01:03:49.408 --> 01:03:52.661
- Yeah.
- Some straight thinking is called for, Bill.

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:55.580
- You've let things slip away.
- But I mean, look,

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.416
give this to Jacob and tell him
we're not falling behind.

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:03.255
This, Bill...
this is money, yeah?

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:06.591
You know there's more
to this than money.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.650
- Sorted, Jonny?
- Sorted, Maggie.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.653
Make sure he doesn't
get too excited, eh?

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.780
Yeah, I'm watching him,
Jonny.

01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:33.743
I know you can see
the bigger picture, yeah?

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.704
Yeah.

01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:38.248
This house, eh...

01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:41.251
- a lot of nice memories.
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.420
I don't want anything
to mess with that.

01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:50.135
Well, it's only work, eh?

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:55.891

mess it up, Jonny.

You informed
on my husband and my kid

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.218
and then
you killed Garvey.

01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:15.220

Oh, well.

Bill: I mean, he could be
all right, your brother.

01:07:06.313 --> 01:07:09.482
- We had some great laughs.
- Maggie: Did we?

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:12.402
Yeah. It's a rotten thing
to have happened,

01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:16.197
but tough decisions
have to be made.

01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:18.908
It's not the decisions
that are tough, Bill.

I haven't seen him
in a few days.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:08.792
Eric's in Spain.

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:11.461
What? Now?

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:14.297

Yeah, well, people
are unreliable.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:22.721
- What?
- He's gone down there

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.683
I think to...
to buy a bar.

01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:27.810
I think he's gonna
start a club

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.854
- called Los Foxos.
- No!

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.066

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.117
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

01:08:42.326 --> 01:08:45.120
- Bingo.
- A bit of bingo.

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:47.913
I can see Eric leading the conga,
up at the front.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:50.875
Yeah. I think he must
have caught a whiff of a señorita.

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:54.921
You know what I mean?
Got straight to the airport and disappeared.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:58.466

No... I'm done.

01:12:57.164 --> 01:13:00.458
You got any last words?
Any thoughts?

01:13:00.667 --> 01:13:06.005
- I'm tired.
- Yeah, you have a sleep, mate.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.007
I'm sure you'll
pull through.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:11.969
Yeah, maybe.

01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:15.598
- The doctors said...
- Oh, Dave...

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.809
don't listen to what
the doctors say, mate.

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:20.561
What do they know?

01:13:25.943 --> 01:13:27.860
What is it, mate?

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.446
Bill's a liability, Karl.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.533
Yeah?

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:36.702
It's all over for him.

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:39.414
It's just a matter
of time now.

01:13:39.623 --> 01:13:40.957

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:42.625
I hear things.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:45.878
What, on Ceefax?

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:49.424
You say goodbye to him
for me, will you?

01:13:49.633 --> 01:13:51.342
Yeah.

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:54.303
- I always liked your dad.
- (laughs)

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:57.640
That makes one of us, Dave.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:01.269
Eric's been found.

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:07.525
- Where is he?
- He's dead, Karl.

01:14:07.734 --> 01:14:10.862
No.

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:14.615
- I'm sorry, mate.
- He's in Spain, mate.

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:18.786
- He was a police informer, Karl.
- Bullshit.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:22.582
That's bullshit.
That's... that's bullshit.

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:26.252
Eric, Garvey,

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.422
your old man...

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:32.341
they all talk to plod.

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:37.597
How else do you think
your court case got squashed?

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:39.807
No.

01:14:47.774 --> 01:14:51.944
Look at the fucking
state of me.

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.447
Why would I lie?

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.204
Huh?

01:15:01.413 --> 01:15:03.623
Why would I lie?

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:14.467
You'd better
fucking die, Dave.

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:21.891
Oh.

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.312
Berman's dead.

01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:35.363
To Dave Berman having
a drink in heaven.

01:15:35.572 --> 01:15:37.532
- (glasses clink)
- Dave.

01:15:37.741 --> 01:15:40.493
Dave.

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:42.453
Had a good run,
though, didn't he?

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:44.539
He's left us right in it
though really, didn't he?

01:15:44.748 --> 01:15:47.500
I mean,
it's a bit selfish.

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:49.544
I mean, would a bit
of exercise have hurt?

01:15:49.753 --> 01:15:51.546
His poor wife.

01:15:51.755 --> 01:15:53.839
(tsking)

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:56.759
Yeah, the old ones
all drop away.

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:08.479
It suddenly feels like
the end of the world.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.357
You're just tired.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.610
It's all a bit
fucking tiring.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:19.156
You know, I liked it best
when it was just you and me.

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:02.366
(both grunting)

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:13.878
- (thudding)
- (grunting, groaning)

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:23.763
(groaning, coughing)

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:29.435
(wheezing)

01:17:43.867 --> 01:17:46.118
(squishing)

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.835
(labored breathing)

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.681
(breathing stops)

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.891
Oh, Christ.

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:52.393
You see?

01:18:52.602 --> 01:18:54.019
And you want
to leave this house?

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:56.313
It's not safe for you
out there on your own.

01:18:56.523 --> 01:18:58.649
(heaving)

01:19:00.944 --> 01:19:05.573
- Who did this to you?
- One of yours, was he?

01:19:05.782 --> 01:19:09.201
- What you are talking about?
- Well, it feels like your style.

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.620
And you call me sloppy.

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:14.206
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come off it.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.376
Own up to it. Own it!
Fucking own it!

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.795
- Look what you fucking did to me.
- The situation's...

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:22.256
Look what you
fucking did to me.

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:24.800
It's got nothing to do with me.
It's probably London.

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:29.054
That's bullshit and you fucking know it,
you fucking liar!

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:30.931
It could be a local faction
making a move.

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:32.933
How the fucking hell
do I know?

01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:35.311
I mean, I don't run
this town, man.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.564
- It's like juggling oil now.
- You said it was all under control.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.692
- You fucking told me it was all under control.
- That's an arrogant illusion.

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:43.736
It fucking is
an arrogant illusion,

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:46.781
and you're the fucking
arrogant one, you prick.

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:48.949
- Look, all...
- Fucking leave me alone, Dad.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:51.327
I'm serious. Get out of my
fucking business.

01:19:51.536 --> 01:19:53.496
I'm fucking serious.

01:19:53.705 --> 01:19:56.040
I don't wanna hear
another fucking word from you.

01:19:56.249 --> 01:19:58.334
- I'll fucking knock you out.
- Yeah?

01:19:58.543 --> 01:20:00.002
Well, all I know is,
all right,

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.879
one, investigations;

01:20:02.088 --> 01:20:05.424
two, that fucking woman
turns up;

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:07.927
three, a trusted associate
goes missing...

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:12.389
Stand fucking back, man.
I'll put these glasses in your fucking face.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:14.433
I'm not kidding.

01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:17.436
Yeah?
And four,

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.563
a representative
of London comes down;

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.065
and five,
you get attacked.

01:20:21.274 --> 01:20:23.275
I mean, those are
the facts, right?

01:20:24.736 --> 01:20:27.446
Saying them in a row
doesn't connect them.

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:30.074
It's got nothing
to do with me.

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.035
Where's Eric?

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:34.995
- Do you even know if it's your kid?
- It is!

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:36.872
What the fuck?
Where is Eric?

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.625
Look, I'll be absolutely honest
with you, Karl.

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.961
She has to go.

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:46.131
- What are you talking about?
- It's her... Valda.

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:50.177
- Before the baby's born.
- What?

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:51.804
You'll be too attached
to her by then.

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:53.472
Are you out of your
fucking mind, Dad?

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.391
- We're getting married.
- Well, that's off.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.893
No, we're getting married, Dad.
We're having a kid.

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:00.229
We're... we're getting married
and we're having a kid.

01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:02.439
- Trust me, son, you're too weak.
- I'm not weak.

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:04.108
- Look...
- I'm not fucking weak.

01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:06.944
You've grown up privileged
and spoiled and soft,

01:21:07.153 --> 01:21:09.530
and now you're unconcerned
about other people's needs.

01:21:09.739 --> 01:21:11.156
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:13.409
I do everything
for you, Dad.

01:21:13.618 --> 01:21:16.871
I do everything for you. I make
your fucking tea, your fucking breakfast.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.664
I make your fucking dinner
half the time.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.291
I run your errands
all over town.

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:21.792
What more do you
want from me?

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:24.253
Come on, seriously.

01:21:24.462 --> 01:21:26.547
- She's unbalanced your mind.
- Fucking hell.

01:21:26.756 --> 01:21:30.301
She's driven you crazy
and you're not making any sense.

01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:32.928
One more word from you
about her, Dad...

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:34.555
Just keep your beak out,
all right?

01:21:34.764 --> 01:21:36.223
You want your mother and I
to go to prison?

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:38.851
- You want us to be murdered in our beds?
- No!

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.687
Look, listen to me.
She's got to go.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.564
She's the rogue element.

01:21:43.773 --> 01:21:47.443
You could have had the breakfast room
decorated by now.

01:21:47.652 --> 01:21:50.112
Who are you siding with?
Your blood or some stranger you rocked up?

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:51.822
She's not just rocked up.

01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:53.490
I've been going out
with her for a year.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.075
She's carrying my child.

01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:58.203
What fucking qualifications
does she need, Dad?

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:00.581
Oh, I see. You're thinking,
"Wait till the old ones

01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:02.583
pop their clogs
and then get the house."

01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:04.668
- Is that it?
- I don't want your fucking house!

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:07.504
I'd rather give it to a cats' home
than to you and that fucking slag.

01:22:07.714 --> 01:22:09.214
I don't want
your fucking house.

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:10.966
You'd betray your family
just to bring up

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:12.468
another man's bastard?

01:22:12.677 --> 01:22:14.386
Don't talk to me
about betrayal.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.180
I know that Eric
is dead.

01:22:16.389 --> 01:22:18.724
And I know that you,
Eric and Garvey

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:21.101
- have been talking to the police.
- What?!

01:22:21.311 --> 01:22:23.520
- Where'd all this come from?
- Berman told me.

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:25.689
- Death-bed confession, was it?
- As it turns out.

01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:27.274
He was addled
with morphine.

01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:29.109
Fucking hell, he was
chatting his bollocks

01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:30.736
to anyone who came
into the room.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.821
- Was he?
- Yes.

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:36.283
- Was he?
- Yes!

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:39.870
Look, you can just tell it
to me straight, Dad.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.372
Just fucking
be honest with me

01:22:41.581 --> 01:22:44.416
forjust...
forjust a minute.

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:46.335
Just one minute.

01:22:46.544 --> 01:22:49.964
Just fucking tell me
what's going on in there.

01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:55.678
Oh, you can't
fucking do it, can you?

01:22:55.887 --> 01:22:57.930
You fucking coward!

01:23:01.017 --> 01:23:04.103
This is disappointing.

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.854
Take no notice of him.

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:08.190
He just says the first thing
that comes into his head.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.402
How can you stand him?
He's a fucking nightmare.

01:23:11.611 --> 01:23:14.196
- No, he's not a nightmare actually.
- He is a fucking nightmare.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:18.283
- Karl, calm down.
- Mom, just fucking leave me alone, all right?

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:20.869
It's not him, Karl.
It's you.

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:22.746
I mean, why don't you
just get a blood test?

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:25.916
And then if the baby's yours,
it could come and live here.

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:29.128
It'll be... it'll work out.
It'll be fine.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:32.172
What about Valda?

01:23:32.382 --> 01:23:35.342
Oh, Valda, darling...
she'll be like all the rest.

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:38.387
- She'll leave you.
- What are you talking about?

01:23:38.596 --> 01:23:41.098
Oh God.

01:23:41.307 --> 01:23:43.642
When you was little,
right?

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.519
When you was born,

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.187
it was very different
then, Karl.

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:49.189
And they...

01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:51.650
you know, they couldn't help babies
out like they do now.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.235
And there was
something wrong...

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:55.154
something went wrong.
I don't know.

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:58.532
The incubator... oh, God knows
what went on really.

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:01.201
I'm sure that's why... all this business
about Eric...

01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:02.995
(weeping)
Please stop. No, please stop.

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:06.540
All this business about Eric...
and you know your dad...

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.375
we had nothing
to do with that.

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:11.587
You all are fakes.

01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:14.840
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna tell you.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.968
Come here, darling.
Come here.

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:22.306
Come...

01:24:22.515 --> 01:24:25.517
I'll tell you what.
I'll get you your pills, eh?

01:24:26.644 --> 01:24:29.104
You need
a nice lie-down.

- You expecting someone?
- Yeah. It's Valda, Mom.

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:17.606
- I thought we were going into town?
- Yeah, I know.

01:27:17.815 --> 01:27:20.400
- I thought maybe you could go with her instead.
- Why?

01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:23.695
- Just talk to her a little bit.
- What about?

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:26.114
Well, she's just
freaking out, Mom.

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:28.283
What, about the baby?

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:31.411
Yeah. Maybe you could
just settle her down a bit?

01:27:31.621 --> 01:27:35.582
- I'm not a counselor, Karl.
- Mom, please, Mom.

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:37.918
Fine.

01:27:38.127 --> 01:27:40.128
Maggie:
How are you feeling?

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:41.964
Valda:
Feeling pretty good, actually.

01:27:42.173 --> 01:27:43.799
Yeah, not for long.
(chuckles)

01:27:44.008 --> 01:27:46.677
- Valda: What do you mean?
- Oh, getting it out.

01:27:46.886 --> 01:27:50.472
Boy, the pain.
You want someone to shoot you.

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:52.516
It's the great
conspiracy of women...

01:27:52.725 --> 01:27:54.977
no one ever tells you.

01:27:55.186 --> 01:27:58.480
I didn't speak
to my mother for days.

01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:01.525
Karl weighed
9lbs 10oz.

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:04.152
There's the car.

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:06.655
Nice bit of fresh air
anyway.

01:28:09.909 --> 01:28:12.786
Can you grab my cardie
out of the boot, please, Maggie?

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:14.705
Yeah.

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:19.334
Oh, what's all this plastic?

01:28:25.758 --> 01:28:28.760
- Do you know where your mother is?
- She's gone out.

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.846
Yeah? Gone where?

01:28:31.055 --> 01:28:33.974
She's gone out with Valda.

01:28:34.183 --> 01:28:37.060
- They're up on the downs.
- Oh.

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:39.855
I wonder if we're still
having sausages tonight then.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.275
I don't know.

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:45.485
You all right, Karl?

01:28:57.999 --> 01:29:00.751
Got a bit of a problem, Dad.

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.086
That sounds ominous.

01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:10.927
It's like that, is it?

01:29:12.722 --> 01:29:16.516
It's for the best...
for everyone.

01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:19.811
Look, why don't you just have a cup of tea
with me and talk about it, Karl?

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:21.938
No, that's all right.

01:29:22.148 --> 01:29:24.149
You have one.

01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:35.118
Do you love me?
I love you.

01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:39.664
I can't talk to you anymore.
You just confuse me.

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:42.125
What's your mother
going to say?

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:49.883
Karl:
She's gone already.

01:29:50.093 --> 01:29:52.719
- Bill: What's happened?
- Dad, just sit down.

01:29:52.929 --> 01:29:58.141
- Just sit down.
- Karl, where's Maggie?

01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:01.228
- Karl, where is Maggie?
- Just sit down, Dad.

01:30:28.798 --> 01:30:32.426

01:31:02.331 --> 01:31:05.459
- Valda: Hello?
- We're in the breakfast room.

01:31:13.259 --> 01:31:18.555
- Well, there he is.
- Yeah.

01:31:18.764 --> 01:31:20.765
How did it go?

01:31:22.685 --> 01:31:25.061
He was all right
with it, actually.

01:31:26.772 --> 01:31:29.733
He was fucking
shattered, wasn't he?

01:31:29.942 --> 01:31:31.943
He was knackered.
