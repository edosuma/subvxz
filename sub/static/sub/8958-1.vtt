00:59.559 --> 01:01.459
Come on, little brother.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.462
Checkout time.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.861
Yeah.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.702
Everyone's well
behind us, Senator.

01:18.778 --> 01:21.144
When we cross
the finishing line,

01:21.214 --> 01:23.580
we'd best look like champions.

01:39.065 --> 01:40.657
Howdy.

01:41.067 --> 01:43.092
Nice morning,
don't you think?

01:43.169 --> 01:45.729
You went over it.
You went off the wagon trail.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.932
Cross-country race, ain't it?

01:48.007 --> 01:51.170
Well, I didn't ride 1, 100
miles to finish second place.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.609
Why did you, then?

01:52.679 --> 01:55.375
This race is mine, cowboy.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.574
Hyah!

01:56.649 --> 01:58.276
Ready when you are, brother.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.951
Let 'er buck.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.839
Yee-haw!

02:29.048 --> 02:33.451
Based on the Life of Frank T Hopkins

02:35.522 --> 02:37.114
Whiskey.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.201
That's right.

02:52.272 --> 02:55.105
I don't like
your style, Hopkins.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.143
Hey!
You made it.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.309
Mustangs don't belong
in races with thoroughbreds.

03:02.382 --> 03:06.478
If you ask me,
they belong in fertilizer.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.852
Mister...

03:11.925 --> 03:15.292
You can say anything
you want about me.

03:15.361 --> 03:19.559
I'm gonna have to ask you not
to talk about my horse that way.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.599
Call it.

03:29.475 --> 03:30.703
Tails.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.312
Mr. Hopkins...

03:37.383 --> 03:39.010
Private Abernathy.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.814
With the 7 th.

03:40.887 --> 03:45.051
Major Whitside, 2nd Battalion,
7 th Cavalry Encampment,

03:45.124 --> 03:48.651
at Wounded Knee Creek, sir.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.258
Carry on.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.731
Mr. Hopkins...

03:54.734 --> 03:56.361
Right now, huh?

04:00.673 --> 04:05.804
Wounded Knee Creek
December 29, 1890

04:15.421 --> 04:17.548
Dispatch rider!

04:30.236 --> 04:32.568
"Major Whitside, 7 th cavalry,

04:32.639 --> 04:34.607
commanding battalion
in the field.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.141
General Miles
directs me to say

04:36.209 --> 04:40.646
that a solution to the Sioux
uprising must be found at once.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.408
Disarm the Indians.

04:42.482 --> 04:45.280
Take every precaution
to prevent their escape.

04:45.351 --> 04:49.151
If they choose to fight,
subdue them. "

04:49.789 --> 04:51.586
Dispatch, sir.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.205
They've been doing it all night.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.366
There's gonna be an uprising.

05:09.442 --> 05:12.570
No, soldier.
It's a ghost dance.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.135
That's all.

05:14.213 --> 05:17.808
Praying to their ancestors
for help.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.429
Boy.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.727
Where are they taking us?

05:38.204 --> 05:40.434
They called you Blue Child.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.904
I knew your mother.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.409
Get back behind the tent line.

06:08.401 --> 06:09.595
Come on, now.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.364
You don't need that.
Come on.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.136
You know what army this is,
Big Foot?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.340
This is the 7 th.
Yellow Hair's men.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.007
Do you remember Pahaska?

06:24.083 --> 06:26.313
Yeah, you probably
ate his liver.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.314
Hey, you.
Come here.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.186
Give me the gun.

06:37.630 --> 06:41.327
Black Coyote is deaf.
He cannot hear your orders. Please...

06:41.401 --> 06:42.732
Let go of it!

06:56.048 --> 06:57.538
What are you doing, Bronco?

06:57.617 --> 06:59.482
Go on, there!

07:00.319 --> 07:03.220
What are you looking at?

08:02.181 --> 08:04.479
27 Congressional medals

08:04.550 --> 08:08.145
were awarded at a place
called Wounded Knee.

08:08.354 --> 08:14.315
This was the proud 7th who fought at the Little
Bighorn Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show Eight Months Later

08:14.393 --> 08:17.954
and saw their great general
killed in battle.

08:18.030 --> 08:22.364
The Battle of Wounded Knee
would not be that way.

08:24.070 --> 08:27.597
On that day,
outnumbered by warriors,

08:27.673 --> 08:30.233
but undaunted in spirit,

08:30.309 --> 08:33.710
the brave 7 th held their ground.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.246
Hopkins!

08:37.250 --> 08:39.980
Get up.
Hidalgo's up next.

08:40.052 --> 08:43.044
Hey, Phoebe Anne.
Get your own gun.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.784
Making sure you don't
have live shot in there.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.122
Damn gun's loaded,
and so are you.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.061
- I'm getting out of Cleveland.
- Good. 'Cause we're in Boston.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.325
Come here. Remember?
You're the good guy.

08:53.399 --> 08:57.199
Who has come out to parlay
with Buffalo Bill?

08:57.270 --> 09:01.263
Could it be a real and living
war chief of the red race?

09:01.340 --> 09:04.605
Chief Eagle Horn.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.912
Mothers, hold your
children close.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.447
This is not an act.

09:09.515 --> 09:13.212
You are beholding
the last of the wild hostiles,

09:13.286 --> 09:16.050
the red pirates of the prairies.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.682
He who scalped many a pioneer

09:18.758 --> 09:20.487
on the bloody warpath

09:20.560 --> 09:23.120
that led to the winning
of the West.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.129
Now, this is the man
whose power

09:25.197 --> 09:28.894
took the life
of the great General Custer

09:28.968 --> 09:32.301
on the day that
Colonel Cody was too late.

09:37.543 --> 09:40.944
And that, gentlemen, is
why they call me Texas Jack.

09:46.652 --> 09:52.921
Far Rider, I must speak to Long Hair.
Please speak United States for me.

09:57.496 --> 10:00.795
Chief says his people
are vanishing

10:00.866 --> 10:03.699
faster than he can
earn silver with you.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.329
- Can't this wait?
- Curb your tongue, Nate!

10:06.405 --> 10:09.169
Let the chief speak.

10:16.849 --> 10:21.286
Chief Eagle Horn says
that our - his nation's hoop

10:21.354 --> 10:23.219
is broken and scattered.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.348
The buffalo herds
have been destroyed.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.915
Elk and deer are gone.

10:27.994 --> 10:31.452
And now the government is
rounding up our wild horses,

10:31.530 --> 10:34.931
and they plan
to shoot them, too,

10:35.001 --> 10:36.468
before the first snows.

10:36.535 --> 10:38.901
They put a price
on the native horses

10:38.971 --> 10:42.600
too great
for a poor Indian to meet.

10:42.675 --> 10:46.975
Chief says that perhaps his
people have lost their lands,

10:47.046 --> 10:49.139
but not their spirit.

10:49.715 --> 10:53.276
And he asks you for your help.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.219
Tell my dear friend Eagle Horn

10:56.288 --> 10:59.587
that the mustang breed
has known its day

10:59.659 --> 11:01.217
and served its purpose.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.523
If my chief
wishes a fine horse,

11:03.596 --> 11:05.063
I will give to him

11:05.131 --> 11:08.294
a thoroughbred steed
of his chosen color.

11:09.735 --> 11:14.934
Yes. He'll do whatever he can.

11:25.418 --> 11:31.414
Behold the famed
Cheyenne-to-Deadwood stage line.

11:31.490 --> 11:34.459
What? What?

11:34.527 --> 11:37.291
Heavens, folks!
It's an ambush.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.025
What think you
of the show, Aziz?

11:40.099 --> 11:42.932
Bravely, the pioneer
meets the savages...

11:43.002 --> 11:45.095
Jack, what are you doing?
Hold on to it.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.799
- Get your foot up there, Frank.
- This is the real West...

11:47.873 --> 11:51.707
and not for the faint of heart.

11:51.777 --> 11:54.610
And now, folks,
you remember them,

11:54.680 --> 12:02.143
rough-riding Frank Hopkins
and his horse, Hidalgo!

12:05.491 --> 12:07.891
Galveston, Texas,
to Rutland, Vermont,

12:07.960 --> 12:10.292
is over 1,800 miles.

12:10.362 --> 12:13.798
But Frank Hopkins
and his painted wonder

12:13.866 --> 12:17.233
made the ride in 30 days.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.397
Can cross the country
in 30 days,

12:19.472 --> 12:22.134
but he can't find
his horse backstage.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.520
The wounded-soldier trick!

12:36.589 --> 12:38.216
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:38.290 --> 12:41.953
let's hear it
for the wounded-soldier trick.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.962
You're lucky
this gun's got blanks.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.727
Let go of me,
you rabbit-eared...

12:49.802 --> 12:51.292
And the horse

12:51.370 --> 12:55.238
- drags the wounded soldier home.
- Let go of me!

13:07.820 --> 13:10.789
Sheikh Al Riyadh is keeper
of the Muniqi stallion.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.619
His excellency's
royal stables

13:12.691 --> 13:15.558
preserve the purest equine
bloodline in the world.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.859
And he wishes to invest
in the Cody enterprise?

13:18.931 --> 13:20.899
The Sheikh of Sheikhs,
His Greatness,

13:20.966 --> 13:22.729
is beyond investment.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.362
His pride is
in his family horses.

13:25.437 --> 13:29.032
You see, Mr. Cody, the sheikh's
own stallion, Al-Hattal,

13:29.108 --> 13:33.067
is the greatest living
endurance-race champion

13:33.145 --> 13:34.703
of all time.

13:34.780 --> 13:37.078
The sheikh saw your show
in Paris.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.277
His honor was deeply
insulted by your claim

13:40.352 --> 13:44.118
to exhibit the world's greatest
endurance horse and rider.

13:44.190 --> 13:47.250
Hidalgo is a legend, my friends.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.487
He has never lost
a long-distance race.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.120
In America, perhaps.

13:51.197 --> 13:55.133
On deserts that women from
my country could cross on foot.

13:55.201 --> 13:58.329
Frank, you just missed some
compliments about your horse.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.372
Five minutes, Billy.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.771
Gentlemen, I present
rough-riding Frank Hopkins.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.835
- Mr. Hopkins, a pleasure.
- Mr. Cody, His Excellency...

14:06.912 --> 14:09.938
- Sit down before you fall down.
- ... you remove the title

14:10.015 --> 14:12.609
that you have bestowed
on this American horse.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.949
What's going on here, Bill?

14:15.888 --> 14:17.583
Perhaps you have never heard

14:17.656 --> 14:20.454
of the great horse race
of the Bedouin.

14:20.526 --> 14:26.260
It has been held annually
for more than 1,000 years.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.893
A 3,000-mile race.

14:30.469 --> 14:33.063
Across the Arabian Desert.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.575
Along the Persian Gulf and Iraq.

14:36.876 --> 14:41.074
And across the sands
of Syria to Damascus.

14:42.548 --> 14:47.576
It is known
as the "Ocean of Fire. "

14:47.653 --> 14:50.781
Our office will accept
your entry at $ 1,000

14:50.856 --> 14:52.790
in Spanish silver.

14:52.858 --> 14:57.352
The winner's purse makes
the victor very honored.

14:57.429 --> 15:00.796
Very...
How do we say?

15:00.866 --> 15:05.064
Very rich, Mr. Cody.

15:05.137 --> 15:08.129
These boys are serious, Frank.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.665
His greatness invites
you and your horse

15:10.743 --> 15:12.142
to enter in the challenge

15:12.211 --> 15:13.838
if you will not
remove the title

15:13.913 --> 15:16.905
that you have bestowed
on this impure animal.

15:16.982 --> 15:19.109
Impure?

15:19.184 --> 15:22.051
He is pure mustang, friend.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.521
What shall I tell
His Excellency?

15:24.590 --> 15:27.457
You can go tell him
to pound sand for all I care.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.224
Tequila.

15:31.297 --> 15:34.061
To be more exact,
my Arabian friend.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.363
Gentlemen, the third act
is starting.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.097
I suggest you take your seats.

15:45.411 --> 15:50.542
A very wise choice
you have made, Mr. Hopkins.

15:55.821 --> 15:58.551
I don't think that was
a compliment, Frank.

16:12.538 --> 16:16.907
Long Hair has promised me
rock candy in Pittsburgh.

16:30.089 --> 16:33.581
Our good red and blue days are over.

16:34.226 --> 16:37.320
Perhaps all of us will die
in this show of the great Cody.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.664
You have a chance
to go save yourself, Far Rider.

16:44.803 --> 16:52.107
Hidalgo is not the horse
he used to be, Chief.

16:56.115 --> 17:00.211
There's nothing wrong with that horse.

17:00.853 --> 17:07.088
Is it better to perish here
in this Wild West, as Cody tells it?

17:12.330 --> 17:17.268
I saw what happened
at Wounded Knee Creek.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.904
I carried the orders.

17:26.912 --> 17:33.374
I call you Far Rider, not because of
your great races and your fine pony,

17:34.553 --> 17:42.824
but because you are one who rides far
from himself, and wishes not to look home.

17:43.929 --> 17:47.558
Until you do,
you are neither white man nor Indian.

17:48.267 --> 17:51.100
You are lost.

18:17.796 --> 18:20.560
You think we got one more in us?

18:22.234 --> 18:24.566
Nah, me neither.

18:24.636 --> 18:25.933
Hell, I don't even know

18:26.004 --> 18:28.871
who Frank Hopkins
is no more, brother.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.845
A hundred of us
put in our 10 coin.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.249
Chief Eagle Horn put in 20.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.346
Don't waste our money, Hopkins.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.172
There goes Hopkins.

19:24.663 --> 19:29.032
The house of Sheikh Riyadh
will be greatly honored.

19:29.101 --> 19:33.868
Bertolt, accommodate Mr. Hopkins
and his horse.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.824
Halt!

21:09.935 --> 21:12.403
Are you all right, sir?

21:23.015 --> 21:26.348
Ice is a precious commodity
at sea, my friend.

21:26.418 --> 21:30.650
My gin might go warm
for the sake of your misfortune.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.348
Much obliged.

21:32.424 --> 21:36.258
But I'd take a warm gin
over ice anytime, mister.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.852
Major, actually.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.761
Major Davenport.
Yes.

21:40.832 --> 21:45.030
Oh. I believe you already
know my wife, Lady Anne.

21:46.104 --> 21:49.039
She tells me you put on
quite a Wild West display

21:49.107 --> 21:50.404
down there in steerage.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.670
You handled yourself
with aplomb.

21:52.744 --> 21:53.938
Well done.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.609
Now, tell me, Mr. Hopkins...

21:56.682 --> 21:58.741
Is it true that you're
en route to Aden

21:58.817 --> 22:00.785
to enter your horse
in the famous race?

22:00.852 --> 22:03.582
Well, I can't think
of any other reason

22:03.655 --> 22:05.452
to cross the big water, ma'am.

22:05.524 --> 22:06.821
Splendid.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.291
He's the real item, isn't he?

22:08.360 --> 22:11.454
Have you ever killed
any red Indians?

22:12.464 --> 22:14.762
Just one.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.324
A long time ago.

22:17.402 --> 22:20.200
Do you know who you'll be
racing against, Mr. Hopkins?

22:20.272 --> 22:24.333
Yeah. Pretty near a hundred
Arabians is the word.

22:24.409 --> 22:28.470
It's not just 100 Arabians.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.209
It's 100 of the finest
and purest horses

22:31.283 --> 22:33.547
ever bred on the sands
of the Nedj.

22:34.252 --> 22:36.812
There's Al-Hattal,
the sheikh's champion.

22:36.888 --> 22:40.415
Al Amir of Syria is entering
Kusma, the blue mare.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.357
And then there's Camria.

22:42.427 --> 22:44.827
The red racer who descends
from the great Al-Jebla.

22:44.896 --> 22:45.920
The best.

22:45.997 --> 22:48.397
Who owns that one?
Queen of Sheba?

22:50.135 --> 22:52.467
No, Mr. Hopkins.
I do.

22:53.438 --> 22:56.100
Lady Davenport has lived
among the Bedouin.

22:56.174 --> 22:59.473
She's fluent
in Arabic, Kurdistani.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.876
And what's that African dialect?

23:01.947 --> 23:03.437
- Tuareg.
- Yes, right.

23:03.515 --> 23:07.178
Tell me, Mr. Hopkins,
what breed is your stud?

23:07.252 --> 23:10.016
Hidalgo's a mustang, ma'am.

23:10.088 --> 23:12.579
Oh! Mustang?

23:12.657 --> 23:16.684
<i>From the Spanish mesteno,
meaning untamed.</i>

23:16.762 --> 23:18.730
That's right.

23:20.098 --> 23:22.362
Horse of the red Indian.
Small, hearty.

23:22.434 --> 23:25.198
Mixed blood.
Of Spanish origin.

23:25.270 --> 23:26.862
Mixed.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.537
Well, I think I'll turn in.

23:33.612 --> 23:34.874
Thanks for the gin.

23:34.946 --> 23:36.311
And the ice.

23:36.381 --> 23:38.611
Nice meeting you, sir.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.076
Ma'am.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.143
Good night, Mr. Hopkins.

23:44.790 --> 23:49.250
I find him rather
ingenuous and charming.

23:49.327 --> 23:50.851
Don't you, Annie?

23:52.864 --> 23:54.798
Sorry, darling?

24:05.944 --> 24:08.606
Godspeed to you all.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.410
Win one for the crown, Annie!

24:15.987 --> 24:18.046
The major prefers
to stay at port

24:18.123 --> 24:21.217
and guard the ice chamber.

24:46.485 --> 24:50.546
Have you never seen
a slave market, Mr. Frank?

25:32.330 --> 25:34.628
Al-Hattal.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.530
Equine perfection.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.563
He sure looks like a handful.

26:17.742 --> 26:24.807
The Prince is a fine young man of
pedigree, educated in the mission school.

26:26.217 --> 26:29.584
I have chosen him to ride Al-Hattal.
Why can you not accept...?

26:29.654 --> 26:30.916
Father...

26:30.989 --> 26:37.189
I pray only for your happiness.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.563
Be careful, then, Father.

26:43.001 --> 26:50.169
Because I am happiest on a horse,
riding where females are forbidden.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.675
There is a tempest in my tent.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.605
But it has come
in the form of my cherished daughter

26:58.049 --> 27:00.745
to upset my failing pancreas.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.714
The Aden caravan has arrived.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.219
The good Lady Davenport...?

27:10.395 --> 27:12.863
Yes. And an American
on a horse of most unusual colour.

27:13.832 --> 27:16.392
The cowboy.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.668
Let in the light.

28:01.079 --> 28:04.014
Well, what do you make of it
so far?

28:09.320 --> 28:11.982
Too late to turn back now.

28:12.557 --> 28:16.220
Very wise to tie
your horse, Mr. Hopkins.

28:16.294 --> 28:18.194
If he were
to cover an Arab mare,

28:18.263 --> 28:21.232
it would be viewed
as a most inviolable blemish.

28:21.299 --> 28:23.665
The foal would need
to be destroyed

28:23.735 --> 28:25.600
before touching the ground.

28:25.670 --> 28:28.332
As would the offending sire.

28:28.406 --> 28:31.603
You hear that?
Keep your pride tucked.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.481
The Rub Al-Khali.

29:16.054 --> 29:18.522
The Empty Quarter.

29:19.290 --> 29:22.521
It is but the first march
of the great race.

29:22.594 --> 29:27.190
Alas, most of the riders
do not even get halfway.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.756
Last year, 40 men perished,

29:29.834 --> 29:33.031
roasted alive
before reaching Iraq.

29:33.104 --> 29:36.562
The fortunate few
cross Allah's Frying Pot,

29:36.641 --> 29:38.734
then must pray
they do not bear witness

29:38.810 --> 29:41.370
to the jinni of the West.

29:43.381 --> 29:46.612
Thank you, sir.
That's mighty interesting.

29:46.684 --> 29:47.708
Ah!

29:47.786 --> 29:50.220
Where the old ones
speak of the sand devil

29:50.288 --> 29:53.121
who guards the secrets
of the passage to the sea.

29:53.191 --> 29:56.718
Those who reach the gulf waters
travel west across Syria

29:56.795 --> 29:58.353
where the sands shift.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.693
East becomes west.
West becomes south.

30:00.765 --> 30:04.565
What looks like sand to you
soon becomes the poison pits.

30:06.237 --> 30:08.865
Men and horses
fall through the air

30:08.940 --> 30:10.305
and are boiled thus.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.400
Get out of here, mister.
Leave me be.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.604
This is not possible!

30:15.180 --> 30:18.980
You see, I was
Sheikh bin Riyadh's goat herder.

30:19.050 --> 30:23.885
I was charged
with the crime of stealing milk.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.154
As punishment,
I have been assigned

30:26.224 --> 30:28.784
to the American and his horse.

30:29.194 --> 30:30.456
You're working for me?

30:30.528 --> 30:33.895
It was this or be
removed of my left hand.

30:33.965 --> 30:37.662
The future will tell
if I have chosen poorly.

30:38.536 --> 30:41.164
To cross Syria to Damascus,

30:41.239 --> 30:43.764
one must face
hundreds of miles of salt

30:43.842 --> 30:45.605
where no food can be found.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.111
Men go mad!

30:49.514 --> 30:51.675
I can see that.

30:51.749 --> 30:54.513
I pray to Allah,
the All-Compassionate,

30:54.586 --> 30:57.919
that he will give you
the merciful wisdom to go home.

30:57.989 --> 30:59.581
You know horses?

30:59.657 --> 31:00.954
Goats.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.652
That'll help.

31:16.674 --> 31:18.733
In the name of Allah,

31:18.810 --> 31:21.904
I welcome you
into my tent as my guest.

31:26.284 --> 31:28.844
If his excellence
were to touch an infidel,

31:28.920 --> 31:31.445
he would lose his ability
to foretell the future.

31:31.522 --> 31:34.457
Oh. Sorry.

31:48.606 --> 31:52.565
Most foreigners find
our coffee to be too potent.

31:52.644 --> 31:53.838
Too...

31:55.680 --> 31:57.978
Back home we toss
a horseshoe in the pot.

31:58.049 --> 32:01.041
Stands up straight,
coffee's ready.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.650
Shall we play at cards?

32:04.722 --> 32:07.714
No, I ain't too much
of a gambler, sir.

32:07.792 --> 32:09.350
To the contrary.

32:09.427 --> 32:14.387
You are gambling with your
very life in this great race.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.572
I had five sons once.

32:28.646 --> 32:31.171
Three were killed in the raids.

32:31.249 --> 32:34.946
One perished
in this very race six years ago.

32:35.019 --> 32:38.785
The other was swallowed
by the quicksand of the Hammad.

32:38.856 --> 32:42.348
I'm now a man with no sons.

32:42.427 --> 32:43.860
Just...

32:44.662 --> 32:47.222
...one lowly daughter.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.697
Please.

32:48.766 --> 32:51.098
Ignore her presence.

32:52.303 --> 32:55.568
I am greatly pleased that you
have accepted my challenge.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.369
But I must warn you.

32:57.442 --> 33:01.606
Never before has a foreigner
partaken in the great race.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.442
Some here are angry.

33:03.514 --> 33:06.244
I'm not here
to insult anybody, sir.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.148
I'm just here to race.

33:08.686 --> 33:10.551
You may smoke if you wish.

33:10.621 --> 33:13.613
Oh, well, don't mind if I do.

33:18.262 --> 33:20.423
The winner's purse
in the Ocean of Fire

33:20.498 --> 33:24.958
exceeds $100,000 in American
currency, Mr. Hopkins.

33:25.036 --> 33:28.164
But that matters
very little to me.

33:28.239 --> 33:32.938
What matters to my house
is honor.

33:33.011 --> 33:37.448
Our culture revolves around
our sacred horses, Mr. Hopkins.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.684
It is written in the Koran.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.220
"For they were born
of the south winds,

33:43.287 --> 33:45.755
and sculpted from
essence by Allah. "

33:51.529 --> 33:57.297
On cold nights, my wives
sleep in the stable tents

33:57.368 --> 34:01.702
so that Al-Hattal
is comfortable and appeased.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.112
Jaffa.

34:14.185 --> 34:18.417
Show Mr. Hopkins to his tent.
He needs his rest.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.021
All right.

34:24.161 --> 34:25.686
Thank you.

34:29.634 --> 34:31.829
Oh, Mr. Hopkins.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.598
Please.

34:36.706 --> 34:39.505
I will amend the winner's
purse with another $10,000

34:39.577 --> 34:42.375
if you will put
that Colt pistol in the pot.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.507
That is an authentic Colt,
is it not?

34:47.952 --> 34:51.649
As they say, God didn't
make all men equal.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.313
Mr. Colt did.

34:53.391 --> 34:56.155
Colt did not make
all men equal, Mr. Hopkins.

34:56.226 --> 34:58.320
You will find this out.

34:58.396 --> 35:00.887
Will you wager
the magnificent weapon?

35:00.965 --> 35:02.830
For $10,000?

35:02.900 --> 35:04.959
I'll gamble on that.

35:05.670 --> 35:07.297
Very good, sir.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.239
Sleep well.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.469
You too.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.844
And blessed be thee.

35:24.355 --> 35:28.223
You must never eat more
than one day's ration.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.419
Do you hear me?

35:30.495 --> 35:32.053
Cowboy!

35:32.830 --> 35:34.957
I will eat it myself.

35:47.245 --> 35:50.976
Hey! Quit messing
with my things.

35:51.282 --> 35:54.718
Is this the symbol
of your nation?

35:55.286 --> 35:56.548
Good as any.

36:00.224 --> 36:02.089
Put that away.

36:14.272 --> 36:15.796
You.

36:15.873 --> 36:18.000
Fetch water.

36:18.075 --> 36:20.100
For the horse.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.578
Okay?

36:22.647 --> 36:24.615
Go on.

36:24.682 --> 36:25.808
Hey!

36:27.018 --> 36:28.280
Get back here!

36:28.352 --> 36:31.719
Come sit down.

36:32.790 --> 36:36.487
That's a very noble deed,
Mr. Rough-Riding Hopkins.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.654
Frank will do, ma'am.

36:39.730 --> 36:43.461
Mary, could we have some more
tea for Mr. Hopkins, please?

36:51.475 --> 36:54.273
You're right at home here,
ain't you?

36:54.345 --> 36:56.905
Well, I spent time amongst
the Bedoui with my father

36:56.981 --> 36:59.245
since I was 13 years of age.

36:59.317 --> 37:00.875
Looking for good horses?

37:00.952 --> 37:03.147
Looking for the breed apart.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.189
My father spent 26 years

37:05.256 --> 37:08.089
trying to ambassador his way
into the Muniqi blood.

37:08.159 --> 37:09.558
Just like his father.

37:09.627 --> 37:12.528
The Viceroy of Egypt,
Napoleon lll.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.566
All of them pandered...

37:15.633 --> 37:17.624
when all they needed to do
was up the ante.

37:17.702 --> 37:19.897
Bad poker players,
the lot of them.

37:19.971 --> 37:23.270
If my mare, Camria,
wins this race,

37:23.341 --> 37:26.902
I'll procure breeding rights
to Al-Hattal.

37:28.846 --> 37:30.814
If I lose...

37:32.416 --> 37:35.908
...I pay 40% of the purse
to the sheikh.

37:40.391 --> 37:41.722
And you, cowboy?

37:41.792 --> 37:43.487
What are you in it for?

37:44.528 --> 37:45.995
Just the purse, ma'am.

37:46.063 --> 37:48.657
"Anne" will do.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.394
Yes, ma'am.

37:53.738 --> 37:56.002
Thanks for the tea.

38:01.712 --> 38:03.111
Frank.

38:03.180 --> 38:06.308
How good are you
and your little express pony?

38:06.384 --> 38:07.373
Really?

38:07.451 --> 38:09.715
I reckon we'll
both find out, ma'am.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.347
3,000 miles from Sunday.

38:32.443 --> 38:34.809
Hey, cowboy!

38:34.879 --> 38:36.506
Every rider's camp

38:36.580 --> 38:40.209
must bear the flag
of his house or nation.

38:40.284 --> 38:42.445
Yusef has made our flag.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.886
Behold it.

38:44.955 --> 38:46.684
We are pitiful.

38:46.757 --> 38:49.851
Would you get over here, Yusef?
I need some more water.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.360
What did he say?

38:59.437 --> 39:02.838
He said he has
no place else to go.

39:02.907 --> 39:05.068
You and me both, partner.

39:05.142 --> 39:06.632
Tell him to get some more water.

39:12.450 --> 39:13.747
Hey.

39:14.418 --> 39:15.885
You too.

39:18.956 --> 39:21.447
Why do you buy this boy, anyway?

39:21.525 --> 39:24.983
Somebody's gotta
do your work, goat herder.

40:19.483 --> 40:21.144
Howdy.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.050
Last chance, cowboy.

40:26.891 --> 40:29.553
My name is Sakr.

40:29.627 --> 40:31.822
Desert law compels me
to speak truthfully.

40:31.896 --> 40:36.162
I find the entry
of a Western infidel sacrilege.

40:36.233 --> 40:37.860
But I trust in Allah

40:37.935 --> 40:40.369
that he'll roast 10 of us
like sheep on a spit

40:40.438 --> 40:42.497
before the sun sets today.

40:42.573 --> 40:44.939
You shall be among the first.

40:45.009 --> 40:48.103
Well, good luck to you, too.

41:04.128 --> 41:09.031
The prince says maybe
we should give you a head start.

41:33.123 --> 41:37.150
Nawali say,
"Ride each day to sunset.

41:37.228 --> 41:40.755
Start again each dawn.

41:40.831 --> 41:41.923
Those who survive

41:41.999 --> 41:45.435
to reach the halfway camp
in the Rub Al-Khali

41:45.503 --> 41:48.734
shall be rewarded
with a full day's rest.

41:48.806 --> 41:52.298
A tent camp will reach
halfway point before you,

41:52.376 --> 41:54.901
traveling by camel road. "

41:54.979 --> 41:58.506
Nawali say,
"Strength to your horses,

41:58.582 --> 42:02.814
and may God have
mercy on your souls. "

42:12.730 --> 42:14.960
Goodbye, cowboy.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.306
Fly high, my friend.

43:27.571 --> 43:28.936
Ease up.
Let them go.

43:30.474 --> 43:32.669
Never beat them
in the quarter-mile.

43:32.743 --> 43:34.301
Whoa, son.

43:34.745 --> 43:35.871
Ease up, brother.

43:40.484 --> 43:42.611
What are you doing here?

43:42.886 --> 43:46.014
Go back to work now.

44:11.281 --> 44:13.272
What did I tell you,
little brother?

44:13.350 --> 44:16.046
It's all for show.

45:13.177 --> 45:15.372
Infidel!
Do not take him!

45:15.446 --> 45:18.347
It is against
the laws of the race.

46:16.507 --> 46:19.374
Best hotel in town, I reckon.

47:32.049 --> 47:33.448
Hey, cowboy!

47:35.385 --> 47:37.751
Nearly 100 miles in one day.

47:37.821 --> 47:39.846
Most impressive!

47:39.923 --> 47:43.086
This is your last chance
to turn back.

47:43.160 --> 47:44.092
Hear me?

47:44.161 --> 47:46.857
You do not belong out here!

47:47.231 --> 47:48.960
Turn back at dawn.

47:49.032 --> 47:52.832
Or prepare for a death
beyond your greatest fear!

47:55.939 --> 48:00.239
Tomorrow I shall not
even look over my shoulder!

49:25.829 --> 49:27.888
A water hole never
looked so good.

49:27.965 --> 49:30.798
What water hole
would that be, sir?

49:32.536 --> 49:34.128
The cistern's dry.

49:34.204 --> 49:36.104
You must discontinue here.

49:36.173 --> 49:39.267
I suggest you take
the east road back to Aden.

49:45.582 --> 49:48.050
That's not even a transit tax.

49:48.118 --> 49:51.019
Six soldiers in the middle
of the Arabian desert

49:51.088 --> 49:52.817
guarding a dry well.

49:52.889 --> 49:54.686
That's unusual.

49:54.758 --> 49:58.057
I said, "The well is dry. "

50:14.878 --> 50:17.278
Okay, brother.

50:17.347 --> 50:20.282
We ain't gonna make another
10 miles without water.

50:21.551 --> 50:22.483
On the whistle.

50:26.556 --> 50:28.649
Are you bloody stupid?!

50:44.241 --> 50:45.435
Go, brother! Go!

51:00.924 --> 51:02.482
Easy, boys.

51:02.559 --> 51:04.823
Long way to Damascus.

51:08.765 --> 51:10.858
What in hellfire?

51:13.637 --> 51:14.831
Let's go, brother.

51:18.742 --> 51:20.141
Hyah!

53:54.097 --> 53:58.124
Better up your price at
the next water hole, Prince.

55:02.165 --> 55:06.465
You are carried by the West Wind
itself, Bin Al Reeh.

55:07.037 --> 55:08.937
How many have fallen?

55:09.005 --> 55:11.439
The report claims
39 have fallen out,

55:11.508 --> 55:13.908
and 11 were lost
in the sandstorm.

55:14.544 --> 55:16.535
Wash him with cold water.

56:00.590 --> 56:02.421
I don't believe it.

56:05.528 --> 56:08.986
You survived the sandstorm.

56:09.065 --> 56:13.661
Allah must have a more
severe judgment awaiting you.

56:13.737 --> 56:15.568
Thanks, partner.

56:28.918 --> 56:31.819
Daidai, we have
one full day's rest

56:31.888 --> 56:33.788
before the long march to Iraq.

56:33.857 --> 56:35.950
Al-Hattal will break away
from the pack.

56:36.025 --> 56:40.257
The mustang is still in,
so we must maintain the pace.

56:40.330 --> 56:41.763
Do you hear me?

56:41.831 --> 56:43.628
Look at me!

56:52.308 --> 56:53.366
Your Excellency.

57:00.950 --> 57:03.885
- Peace be with you.
- And also be with you.

57:03.953 --> 57:05.853
Bless you, Sheikh of Sheikhs.

57:07.824 --> 57:09.587
Sit, Katib. Revive thy spirit.

57:12.695 --> 57:16.688
Allah willing,
I never miss the great race, Uncle.

57:18.034 --> 57:21.595
If I owned more flocks,
I would bet them all.

57:26.776 --> 57:29.836
I have come to beseech you
one last time.

57:30.280 --> 57:35.479
Forgive me, and allow me to share in
the ownership of our forefathers' horses.

57:36.019 --> 57:40.217
You have not the discipline to be keeper of
such royalty as your grandfather's horses.

57:41.791 --> 57:44.316
Least of all Al-Hattal -
he is my son.

57:45.528 --> 57:48.497
Go rob pilgrims.
That is your calling.

57:50.066 --> 57:53.160
Even the blessed Prophet
was a raider in his time.

57:53.636 --> 57:55.501
This is blasphemy.

58:01.311 --> 58:03.006
How is the coffee?

58:04.080 --> 58:06.674
Most excellent. I am revived.

58:10.753 --> 58:14.211
If one tossed a horseshoe
into the pot,

58:14.290 --> 58:16.758
do you think
it would stand erect?

58:17.460 --> 58:21.954
At your age, Uncle, perhaps
it is the only thing that might.

58:23.066 --> 58:27.093
Boldly spoken for a man
with no wives.

58:29.472 --> 58:32.635
How is your health, Uncle?

58:34.644 --> 58:37.579
I have the blood
of a warrior grandfather.

58:53.162 --> 58:56.154
Please, Mr. Frank.
Listen to me.

58:57.367 --> 59:00.200
There will be no grazing
for many days.

59:00.270 --> 59:03.034
That's all right.
I packed some barley.

59:03.106 --> 59:04.698
Take these.

59:06.142 --> 59:07.268
What's that?

59:07.343 --> 59:09.004
Dates.

59:09.078 --> 59:10.477
Trust me.

59:11.047 --> 59:13.072
Take with you this skin.

59:13.149 --> 59:15.982
It is filled with the butter
of camel.

59:16.052 --> 59:20.489
Mix it with the water
for both you and your horse.

59:20.557 --> 59:23.082
It will keep you alive
across the Hammad.

59:23.159 --> 59:26.822
And fear not the locusts.
They are a gift from above.

59:26.896 --> 59:29.330
Not a plague,
as you might believe.

59:29.399 --> 59:32.300
Why are you trying to help me?

59:32.368 --> 59:35.701
If Prince Bin Al Reeh wins
the race on Al-Hattal,

59:35.772 --> 59:37.831
I become his fifth wife.

59:37.907 --> 59:39.568
The youngest of his harem.

59:39.642 --> 59:42.634
No more than a slave
in his house.

59:43.746 --> 59:47.443
I do not know if you are as good
as it is said.

59:47.517 --> 59:51.078
But I have faith
in the painted stallion.

59:52.055 --> 59:55.582
It is said that you captured him
in the wild.

59:55.658 --> 59:57.717
Badlands.

59:57.794 --> 59:59.921
Long time ago.

59:59.996 --> 01:00:02.191
How did you tame him?

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:03.926
I didn't.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:09.036
Why do you wear that?

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:12.734
Verily, you do not know
our world.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:22.842
This is a cowboy's spur.

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.411
Yeah.

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:30.391
My father reads many books
from the outside world.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.054
But his true enjoyment
of literature,

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:37.361
it is of Wild Bill
and Calamity Jane.

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.367
You're boshing me.

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:43.701
In this Wild West,
there are nomads, also.

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:45.707
The red people.

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:49.370
Like the Bedou,
they are a horse culture.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.871
Have you seen
their vanishing kind?

01:00:56.753 --> 01:00:58.914
I am their kind.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.459
My father was a cavalry scout.

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:06.051
He fell in love
with a chief's daughter.

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:07.892
Married her.

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:10.228
They called me Frank T.

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:13.826
My grandmother named me
Hokshelato.

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:16.402
It means "blue child. "

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:21.472
I would know you
only as a white man.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:25.474
Maybe I got good
at hiding my face, too.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.907
Why?

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.376
You don't know our world.

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:36.925
Look out!

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:42.028
Foolish is a foreigner.

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.634
Allah has decided
that I should not sleep well these nights.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.170
You have disgraced this house.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.700
I am sickened.

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:56.237
- It is not how it appears.
- He forced you into his quarters.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.211
No, I went by my own volition.

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.481
I wished only to speak with him.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:09.658
He did not touch your daughter,
but tried to protect her from danger.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.889
I am responsible.

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:16.224
Have you ever considered
just poisoning me, Jazira?

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:18.729
Why torture me with slow precision?

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:21.770
Why force me to marry a man
who has never looked at me?

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:24.065
If he looks at you,
I have to cut off his head.

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.004
You are not yet his property.

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:28.937
The women of the western tribes
no longer wear the veil.

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:33.204
Pray you were of a western tribe.
I would not be in this position.

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:38.181
And in the middle of the great race.
Shame upon you.

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.786
Shame upon you, Father.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:44.287
For allowing me
to ride horses when no one sees.

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:49.196
For taking me on gazelle hunts
when the men make pilgrimage.

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:56.837
You are all I have.
You are my treasure.

01:02:57.974 --> 01:03:03.105
But when the eyes of the people
are on the great sheikh, I am lowly.

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.012
Let him go.

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:15.515
How dare you give orders
to a man in my tent.

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:21.563
Remove a certain woman
to the tent of office.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.292
No. It is not right.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.465
Wait a minute.
She...

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:28.026
Sir!

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.232
It is written, Mr. Hopkins.

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.969
If any of our chaste women
commit lewdness

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:35.408
with evidence against them,

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:39.039
so shall they be taken out
and stoned.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.446
And it is then by law

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:45.249
that the father must drown
his own daughter.

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:48.956
- It wasn't her fault.
- Silence, I said.

01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:51.016
- Ahmed.
- All right.

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:56.292
However, we are still far
from the next cistern.

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:58.959
And water is precious.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:01.435
So my decision is swift.

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:05.801
For her trespass,
my daughter will be flogged.

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:10.335
Seven stripes at a time hence.

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.245
And you.

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:19.311
An impure unbeliever
in the tent of a man

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:22.255
who can trace his very blood
back to Adam.

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:25.294
You will be removed
of your infidel self.

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:27.856
Removed of my what?

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:37.067
Like a stallion
not worthy of breeding.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:43.974
Come here, skinner.

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:50.051
We didn't do nothing, sir!

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.950
I feel compassion for you.

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:55.286
But I cannot let your fear
move me.

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.952
Speak honestly as a man.

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:02.697
Did you violate
my daughter's honor?

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:04.494
No, sir.

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:05.659
I did not!

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:11.840
Can one believe a nonbeliever?

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:24.814
Only fools or gamblers walk
behind a strange mare, Sheikh!

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:25.911
You can believe that!

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:28.047
Is that a passage
from the Bible?

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:31.184
No, it's something Wild Bill
said to me one night.

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:34.959
Wild Bill?

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:37.022
Out in Deadwood!

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:39.192
You refer to the man
known as Hickok?

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.259
The master
of the double six-gun?

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:44.135
Only one Wild Bill, sir.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:47.733
Hickok was a true prince
of pistoleers, was he not?

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.005
He's pretty good
with a twist draw.

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:55.175
What did my daughter say
about your horse?

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:59.711
Well, she's a lady with an eye
for horseflesh, sir.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:02.781
If she was my son,
she would be in this race.

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:05.088
Alas, she is not.

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:13.027
She's a woman who has entered
the sleeping quarters

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.797
of an infidel.

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:18.964
Come, skinner.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:21.441
You heard of the OK Corral?

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:24.479
Ah.
You were not there.

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:34.353
Tell me about this Wyatt Earp.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:35.685
And the Doctor Holliday.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:38.622
Raiders!

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.251
Free him.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.812
Come on.
Hurry up!

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:09.516
Hey!
Get back here!

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:24.038
Tribal war games are
their national sport, Mary.

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:26.006
It's none of our affair.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:40.321
Hey, partner!
How about a hand?

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.520
Thank you kindly.

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:49.597
Go, Prince.

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.991
Al-Hattal. He is gone.

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:54.759
Jazira.

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:55.861
Hy!

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:00.736
I will free you.

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.869
You will run, like the prince.

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.469
Damn coward.

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:07.812
No wonder you don't want to be
his fifth wife.

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.676
Hey!

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.698
Hey, deputy!
Hey!

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:23.953
Jazira...

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:29.698
They've taken her.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.600
They've taken her!

01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:40.270
If I turn over Al-Hattal,
Katib will return my child.

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:42.139
And if you don't?

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.202
He's a bastard son of a jackal

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:46.770
who would have his Gypsies
commit crimes upon her.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:50.113
I cannot surrender what is
most sacred to my family.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.281
You could never understand that,
so do not even try.

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:01.354
The Al Khamsa manuscripts.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.990
My family's breeding book
is gone.

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:05.795
It is gone!

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:08.302
The Al Khamsa book
contains the breeding secrets

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:11.533
of the Muniqi strain
going back to Saba.

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:15.035
Let's bring your deputy in here.

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:29.413
I'll ask you once more,
Aziz, and only once.

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:32.654
Where did they take my daughter?

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.420
I know nothing.

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:38.830
I only took the book
to protect it from the raiders.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.062
It is they who stole it from me.

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:42.831
Stole it?

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.465
Or paid you, my trusted brother?

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:48.032
It matters only to He.

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:51.307
Please, end my humiliation.

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:08.727
What are you doing?

01:11:08.797 --> 01:11:11.322
That's the easy way out.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.662
He ain't getting it.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.564
Please.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.708
Western justice, partner.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.772
That's called
a Mexican tattoo, Deputy.

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:30.842
And that lasts a lot longer
than a sword.

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:40.091
For a man of such high rank,
you're kind of short, Aziz.

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:41.561
We can fix that.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:45.358
No!

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:49.632
I know where they have taken her
until they receive the stallion.

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:01.511
I know you're not
a gambling man.

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:06.283
But bring my daughter back by
nightfall and you're forgiven.

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:09.256
Attempt to deceive me and run,

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:13.386
and you will not get beyond the
port of Jordan with your head.

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:15.757
Run.

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:31.003
Faster, traitor.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.714
His Excellency is most reckless.

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:38.844
Sending a slave
to do a man's job.

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:40.411
Know this, Aziz.

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:43.253
If any harm has befallen
the child,

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:46.761
I shall remove your head myself.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:13:00.934
You know that my father
will never surrender Al-Hattal.

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:06.070
I will tell you something
about your father.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:13.780
He is a failure at being a ruler.
He allows emotions to govern him.

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:16.920
I do not.

01:13:18.072 --> 01:13:20.199
And he has become Sheikh of Sheikhs.

01:13:21.376 --> 01:13:23.867
Whilst you, no more than a brigand.

01:13:25.413 --> 01:13:27.711
I am the greatest horseman of the tribe.

01:13:28.283 --> 01:13:34.051
I could defeat any rider in the great race,
if I was allowed to sit the back of Al-Hattal.

01:13:35.924 --> 01:13:37.255
Why am I not?

01:13:38.459 --> 01:13:43.988
Because the sacred is not for sale,
as are you.

01:13:46.267 --> 01:13:49.759
If Al-Hattal is not turned out
onto the sands of the Hamad by midnight,

01:13:50.738 --> 01:13:55.004
I send your head to my uncle,
wrapped in Baghdad silk.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:57.744
I am warned.

01:14:01.115 --> 01:14:02.912
You are promised.

01:14:33.648 --> 01:14:35.411
Know that if we all die,

01:14:35.483 --> 01:14:38.111
your soul will go straight
to the devil.

01:14:38.186 --> 01:14:40.654
And your impure horse, too.

01:15:26.534 --> 01:15:29.094
That's far enough, Aziz.

01:16:50.918 --> 01:16:53.045
Kill her!

01:16:53.121 --> 01:16:55.146
Jazira, run!

01:17:30.925 --> 01:17:32.688
Jazira!

01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:16.392
Jazira! Jazira!

01:19:16.464 --> 01:19:19.490
Jaffa!

01:19:59.941 --> 01:20:02.034
- Give him his head!
- I know what to do!

01:20:57.164 --> 01:20:58.961
Let's keep moving, miss.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:03.859
He pledged his life for me
when I was born worthless.

01:21:05.072 --> 01:21:06.937
I'm sorry.

01:21:09.076 --> 01:21:12.842
We got to make that tent camp
by sundown.

01:21:22.823 --> 01:21:24.586
Please.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.622
I wish you to look at me.

01:21:54.555 --> 01:22:01.518
Why do I feel that you truly
see me when others do not?

01:22:02.596 --> 01:22:05.121
Well, my horse likes you.

01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:12.665
Even a blind man could see
that you're beautiful.

01:22:18.412 --> 01:22:20.403
We must ride.

01:22:21.148 --> 01:22:23.912
We will stay off
the camel roads.

01:23:05.292 --> 01:23:06.554
What does this mean?

01:23:06.627 --> 01:23:09.095
<i>Shunka Wakan.</i>

01:23:09.163 --> 01:23:10.630
Big dog.

01:23:10.698 --> 01:23:13.531
There's no word in Sioux
for horse.

01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:17.367
When the Indians saw the first
one the Spanish brought over,

01:23:17.438 --> 01:23:19.872
they didn't know
what the hell it was.

01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:24.001
When they saw how it could run,

01:23:24.078 --> 01:23:25.909
carry a man through battle,

01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:28.039
become his friend for life,

01:23:28.115 --> 01:23:31.846
well, they figured it had to be
a sacred animal.

01:23:31.919 --> 01:23:33.386
Indeed.

01:23:34.355 --> 01:23:37.415
Did your mother teach you
this wisdom?

01:23:45.599 --> 01:23:47.726
I am sorry.

01:24:30.277 --> 01:24:34.805
When this race is over,
I will pray five times a day.

01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:40.113
Being an infidel, as you are,

01:24:40.187 --> 01:24:44.351
you cannot be expected
to comprehend.

01:24:44.425 --> 01:24:48.156
There are those who are chosen
to be winners

01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:50.959
and those chosen to be losers.

01:24:51.031 --> 01:24:55.058
Allah chooses thus,
and it is written.

01:25:01.242 --> 01:25:03.710
You are summoned to the tent
of the lady.

01:25:05.479 --> 01:25:07.413
Right now.

01:25:18.392 --> 01:25:22.886
You know, Yusef,
I once had a three-legged colt.

01:25:22.963 --> 01:25:24.555
Born that way.

01:25:24.632 --> 01:25:27.658
Turned out to be one of the best
roping horses I ever had.

01:25:37.611 --> 01:25:39.841
Your mare's running
a good race, ma'am.

01:25:42.116 --> 01:25:44.209
She is rather lovely, isn't she?

01:25:44.285 --> 01:25:45.946
Good legs on her.

01:25:47.888 --> 01:25:51.551
Can you envision her offspring
from an Al-Hattal cross?

01:25:59.833 --> 01:26:02.996
Aziz was not
a very admirable man.

01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:08.303
But he was very adept
in researching bloodlines.

01:26:08.375 --> 01:26:11.970
You have blood
from the red Indian race.

01:26:12.046 --> 01:26:15.880
You hid it effectively
all your life.

01:26:17.284 --> 01:26:20.481
I'm not sure
what you're getting at, ma'am.

01:26:20.554 --> 01:26:23.523
There's no way for me to win
rights to the Muniqi bloodline

01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:25.319
other than to win this race.

01:26:25.392 --> 01:26:29.624
You, on the other hand,
you have another way to win.

01:26:31.432 --> 01:26:33.764
Only one way to win.

01:26:33.834 --> 01:26:37.634
Your little mustang
has proven hardy.

01:26:39.506 --> 01:26:45.069
But the chances of him
crossing Iraq and Syria

01:26:45.145 --> 01:26:50.310
before Al-Hattal and my mare
are slim at best.

01:26:50.384 --> 01:26:53.649
Your horse is weakening,
Mr. Hopkins, and you know it.

01:26:53.721 --> 01:26:58.283
You've taken him so very far
from anything he's ever known.

01:26:59.026 --> 01:27:00.994
All for the sake of money.

01:27:02.663 --> 01:27:06.360
Are you willing to kill him
for money?

01:27:06.433 --> 01:27:09.129
The winner's purse is $100,000.

01:27:09.203 --> 01:27:13.264
Pull out now, and I'll
compensate you 30% in silver

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.171
for turning in a serious effort.

01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:20.708
I've never taken money
for quitting a race.

01:27:44.872 --> 01:27:46.840
Well, then, Frank.

01:27:47.875 --> 01:27:49.968
Just where are we, then?

01:27:51.345 --> 01:27:53.745
Here.

01:27:53.814 --> 01:27:55.406
Alone.

01:27:55.482 --> 01:27:58.178
In the last corner of Arabia.

01:27:59.253 --> 01:28:00.845
Yeah.

01:28:02.389 --> 01:28:07.417
When you're in a desert,
the sight of green grass

01:28:07.494 --> 01:28:10.691
and fresh water can be
mighty tempting.

01:28:10.764 --> 01:28:14.530
Sometimes you're
just seeing things.

01:28:15.469 --> 01:28:17.699
Indeed, Mr. Hopkins.

01:28:19.273 --> 01:28:21.332
Good night, ma'am.

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.780
Frank.

01:28:28.849 --> 01:28:30.612
What of my offer?

01:28:31.218 --> 01:28:32.947
I'll sleep on it.

01:28:34.455 --> 01:28:36.355
And all alone.

01:28:36.423 --> 01:28:38.288
Shame.

01:28:47.935 --> 01:28:50.369
He does not like the milk
of the camel.

01:28:50.437 --> 01:28:53.031
But it will keep his liver
from failure.

01:28:54.274 --> 01:28:56.242
Appreciate it.

01:28:57.845 --> 01:29:01.611
You have visited the tent
of the Christian lady.

01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:06.412
I don't like the look
of them front hooves.

01:29:06.487 --> 01:29:08.819
That quarter crack
is getting worse.

01:29:08.889 --> 01:29:11.619
Another 400 miles
can put him lame.

01:29:11.692 --> 01:29:14.126
You must not give up.

01:29:15.529 --> 01:29:19.898
It might be just time to live
with what we got.

01:29:22.636 --> 01:29:24.570
You will prove them right.

01:29:24.638 --> 01:29:26.731
That blood is more important
than will.

01:29:27.808 --> 01:29:30.777
You will continue your life
hiding who God made you.

01:29:30.844 --> 01:29:32.573
Like me.

01:29:32.646 --> 01:29:34.341
Jazira.

01:29:44.558 --> 01:29:46.321
You done me proud, partner.

01:30:20.694 --> 01:30:22.355
Frank Hopkins.

01:30:23.897 --> 01:30:27.731
I am compelled
to express gratitude.

01:30:50.123 --> 01:30:53.720
Hidalgo!

01:31:13.146 --> 01:31:15.114
Good luck, Mr. Hopkins.

01:31:15.182 --> 01:31:16.979
Thank you, ma'am.

01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:18.608
If I don't see you in Damascus,

01:31:18.685 --> 01:31:20.983
I hope you find the stock
you've been looking for.

01:31:21.054 --> 01:31:22.715
Oh, I will.

01:31:22.789 --> 01:31:25.053
You should have wagered on it.

01:31:28.562 --> 01:31:31.292
The cowboy forgot his drink.

01:32:24.785 --> 01:32:27.310
Do not react.
Remain calm.

01:32:27.387 --> 01:32:29.321
And only I speak.
Atimi, no!

01:32:39.533 --> 01:32:42.934
Call yourself a great Bedou
raider for killing a camel boy.

01:32:43.003 --> 01:32:46.370
For not being able to hold on
to a little harem girl.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.965
You will still pay me my riyals.

01:32:49.042 --> 01:32:51.772
But I will exact it from you.

01:32:51.845 --> 01:32:54.905
And perhaps much more,
Lady English.

01:32:54.981 --> 01:32:57.472
You will receive nothing

01:32:57.551 --> 01:33:01.043
unless my horse reaches
that finishing stone first.

01:33:02.255 --> 01:33:04.519
They're six days
across the Hammad.

01:33:04.591 --> 01:33:07.617
You can intercept them
by using the camel road.

01:33:07.694 --> 01:33:10.424
Force the American
into the Amal Samheem.

01:33:10.497 --> 01:33:13.728
Capture Al-Hattal
and keep him secure.

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.325
But my horse wins this race.

01:33:16.803 --> 01:33:19.067
He made you look quite the fool,
didn't he?

01:33:19.139 --> 01:33:20.197
The cowboy.

01:33:21.608 --> 01:33:23.576
He will beg me to cut
his throat when...

01:33:23.643 --> 01:33:25.804
Do not harm him, Katib.

01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:31.644
Kill his horse
and let him walk the desert.

01:33:34.321 --> 01:33:36.687
There's much for him
to think over.

01:33:38.391 --> 01:33:39.722
Hy!

01:35:59.634 --> 01:36:04.469
Whatever feed was out ahead,
it ain't there no more.

01:36:16.951 --> 01:36:19.476
"A gift from above.

01:36:19.553 --> 01:36:21.453
Not a plague. "

01:36:33.467 --> 01:36:35.901
Once you get past the legs,
it ain't too bad.

01:36:38.606 --> 01:36:40.130
Here you go.

01:36:43.244 --> 01:36:45.542
It goes down pretty smooth,
don't it?

01:36:46.681 --> 01:36:50.139
Come on. Eat up.
We're back in business.

01:37:20.347 --> 01:37:23.077
Let's see who's behind.

01:37:33.027 --> 01:37:34.085
We are.

01:38:00.521 --> 01:38:02.887
Jinni, no. Go away.

01:38:31.218 --> 01:38:33.982
Do not assist me.

01:38:34.054 --> 01:38:36.488
Just kill me, please.

01:38:36.557 --> 01:38:38.821
Use your weapon.

01:38:43.397 --> 01:38:44.625
No.

01:38:44.698 --> 01:38:47.064
It is Allah's will.

01:38:47.134 --> 01:38:49.758
No.

01:38:53.908 --> 01:38:55.170
Tell you what.

01:38:55.242 --> 01:38:57.301
You can do whatever you want
after I get you out of there.

01:38:57.378 --> 01:39:00.108
No!

01:39:10.558 --> 01:39:12.719
Jinni.

01:39:13.427 --> 01:39:15.088
Jinni.

01:39:17.498 --> 01:39:19.591
Jinni.

01:39:19.667 --> 01:39:21.999
How you doin', partner?

01:39:26.507 --> 01:39:29.067
Why you turn back for me?

01:39:30.144 --> 01:39:35.081
Ain't no prize money worth
a man's life, the way I see it.

01:39:36.650 --> 01:39:41.485
It is written that God
leads astray whom he wishes

01:39:41.555 --> 01:39:43.989
and guides whom he wishes.

01:39:44.058 --> 01:39:47.221
It was God's will
that I die in this race.

01:39:47.294 --> 01:39:50.559
Just as it is his will
who shall win.

01:39:50.631 --> 01:39:52.895
What about your will?

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:56.094
What about your horse's will?

01:39:56.170 --> 01:39:59.162
Seems to me that's what will
get you across a finish line.

01:40:00.407 --> 01:40:02.841
Only then is it written.

01:40:08.649 --> 01:40:12.016
Jinni has returned
to carry me home.

01:40:12.086 --> 01:40:13.644
Please.

01:40:13.721 --> 01:40:15.814
My sword.

01:43:34.088 --> 01:43:36.522
Hidalgo!

01:43:36.957 --> 01:43:38.288
Get Al-Hattal.

01:43:47.067 --> 01:43:50.559
Faster. He is escaping.

01:43:54.808 --> 01:43:55.604
Stop.

01:44:00.481 --> 01:44:02.745
You heard the Christian woman.

01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:05.575
We are not to kill him.

01:44:35.282 --> 01:44:37.011
The rope!

01:44:37.084 --> 01:44:38.881
Quickly!

01:44:38.952 --> 01:44:39.884
Hurry!

01:44:49.229 --> 01:44:50.218
Katib!

01:44:50.364 --> 01:44:51.422
Look. The trap.

01:45:01.041 --> 01:45:04.010
Stop. Release the hunters.

01:45:15.155 --> 01:45:17.589
Come on.
Get up.

01:45:27.834 --> 01:45:29.495
Look out!

01:45:36.243 --> 01:45:39.076
Jinni! Jinni!

01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:43.842
You and your horse have made
enough trouble for me.

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.134
Nobody hurts my horse.

01:48:19.806 --> 01:48:21.398
Whoa.

01:48:25.846 --> 01:48:28.144
Settle down.

01:48:28.215 --> 01:48:30.342
Trust me now.

01:49:52.933 --> 01:49:54.833
Whoa.

01:49:54.901 --> 01:49:56.926
Easy, son.

01:49:59.806 --> 01:50:01.899
Don't do it, partner.

01:50:01.975 --> 01:50:04.000
Don't you die on me now.

01:50:04.077 --> 01:50:05.874
We're almost home.

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:09.144
We're almost home.

01:50:14.754 --> 01:50:17.018
We had 'em, brother.

01:50:19.759 --> 01:50:22.353
We had those boys.

01:50:30.537 --> 01:50:32.471
You're all right.

01:50:45.785 --> 01:50:47.377
My old man.

01:51:02.636 --> 01:51:05.969
Remember that 500-mile
in Missouri?

01:51:06.039 --> 01:51:08.507
We had three days in the lead.

01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:13.145
Sitting on that ranch
looking at nothing but green.

01:51:13.213 --> 01:51:15.511
That's it, partner.

01:51:16.516 --> 01:51:22.853
If there's a heaven on Earth,
actually, we found it.

01:51:28.395 --> 01:51:32.593
Well, I reckon if there's
a heaven on Earth,

01:51:32.666 --> 01:51:34.566
there's gonna be a hell, too.

01:51:40.106 --> 01:51:42.700
We just couldn't cross her.

01:52:25.719 --> 01:52:27.243
Help me.

01:53:44.564 --> 01:53:47.556
Blue child.

01:54:18.331 --> 01:54:20.697
Can you see it, cowboy?

01:54:22.469 --> 01:54:24.937
It is the ocean.

01:54:25.905 --> 01:54:29.033
It is only Al-Hattal now,
cowboy.

01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:32.340
You were defeated
before this race began.

01:54:49.629 --> 01:54:52.496
You will not defeat me.

01:54:54.734 --> 01:54:57.532
I am born of a great tribe.

01:54:57.604 --> 01:54:59.333
People of the horse.

01:55:00.607 --> 01:55:02.575
So am I.

01:55:12.152 --> 01:55:14.086
Okay.

01:56:28.728 --> 01:56:31.561
Al-Hattal! Al-Hattal!

01:56:52.518 --> 01:56:55.612
Camria, praise your stamina.

01:57:00.059 --> 01:57:03.290
Cowboy! Cowboy!

01:57:28.888 --> 01:57:30.378
Push her.

01:58:11.798 --> 01:58:13.026
Let 'er buck!

01:59:21.367 --> 01:59:22.834
Ah!

01:59:35.014 --> 01:59:38.347
Cowboy! Cowboy!

02:00:56.662 --> 02:00:58.721
Good race, partner.

02:00:58.798 --> 02:01:00.993
It is a magnificent horse.

02:01:01.067 --> 02:01:02.762
Likewise, Prince.

02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:22.850
It looks better on you.

02:01:24.557 --> 02:01:26.491
For many miles,
I did not understand

02:01:26.559 --> 02:01:29.084
why Allah would wish this on me.

02:01:29.162 --> 02:01:31.858
Now I understand his will.

02:01:32.465 --> 02:01:37.061
Be a guest in my house
for as long as you desire.

02:01:37.136 --> 02:01:38.398
Stay.

02:01:39.572 --> 02:01:44.100
I've been too far from home
for too long, sir.

02:01:50.349 --> 02:01:52.647
I lost the race, Frank Hopkins.

02:01:52.718 --> 02:01:55.243
But you won a friend.

02:01:55.321 --> 02:01:56.913
It's a gift.

02:02:08.634 --> 02:02:11.603
What about your ability
to tell the future?

02:02:11.671 --> 02:02:15.232
If I had the ability
to foretell the future,

02:02:15.308 --> 02:02:18.937
perhaps I would have bet
on a painted horse.

02:02:20.379 --> 02:02:22.609
Blessings be upon thee.

02:02:22.682 --> 02:02:24.741
You too, partner.

02:02:55.915 --> 02:03:00.784
Is it true, then,
as in the Western stories?

02:03:01.354 --> 02:03:04.687
The cowboy rides away
into the setting of the sun?

02:03:08.561 --> 02:03:10.893
But not the same cowboy.

02:03:13.499 --> 02:03:15.797
We won't forget you.

02:03:18.271 --> 02:03:20.501
Goodbye.

02:03:25.011 --> 02:03:26.808
Blue child.

02:03:58.077 --> 02:03:59.977
Assemble on the rim.

02:04:00.046 --> 02:04:01.673
30 paces to a stand.

02:04:01.747 --> 02:04:04.307
Make every shot count.

02:04:06.619 --> 02:04:09.611
What's this bloke doing?
Bringing them in one at a time?

02:04:23.736 --> 02:04:25.567
Lieutenant McNulty?

02:04:25.638 --> 02:04:27.265
Who are you?

02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:29.198
Hopkins.

02:04:29.675 --> 02:04:30.937
Frank Hopkins.

02:04:31.010 --> 02:04:33.604
Hopkins?
You bring a dispatch?

02:04:33.679 --> 02:04:35.476
Yes, sir.

02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:49.453
Paid in full?

02:04:59.472 --> 02:05:01.838
Hold on!
Pull back to the left!

02:05:01.907 --> 02:05:03.841
- How, Kola.
- How, Kola.

02:05:04.076 --> 02:05:08.911
Is it true that the chief named Eagle Horn
has returned to the reservation?

02:05:10.816 --> 02:05:14.343
He has taken the journey.

02:05:16.489 --> 02:05:25.488
But he knew you won, Far Rider,
in the faraway sand.

02:05:27.066 --> 02:05:28.533
Good.

02:05:32.204 --> 02:05:34.672
Will you help me with something?

02:06:58.958 --> 02:07:00.755
Whoa.

02:07:00.826 --> 02:07:02.987
Easy.

02:07:05.097 --> 02:07:07.088
Easy, brother.

02:07:29.154 --> 02:07:31.054
Let 'er buck.
