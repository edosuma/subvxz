You underestimate the power
of the word "rodent."

00:03.270 --> 00:04.830
- Thank you.
- Just say yes.

00:04.990 --> 00:05.950
Partnership?

00:06.110 --> 00:07.390
<i>Good to have
a doctor in the house.</i>

00:07.550 --> 00:09.750
- You want me to work here?
- How did you find me again?

00:09.910 --> 00:12.310
You know my mother.
My father's gone missing.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.590
- <i>Selena Callaway.</i>
- They had some information on me.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.150
- <i>They're blackmailing people.</i>
- This was a huge operation.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.870
- <i>I helped him.</i>
- You're a victim.

00:20.030 --> 00:21.390
I can't believe you took her back
to that place.

00:21.550 --> 00:23.870
I was trying to see
if she remembered something.

00:24.030 --> 00:27.230
He wants to help people.
Some people just can't be helped.

00:27.910 --> 00:30.150
<i>Uniform followed up.
They found a body.</i>

00:30.750 --> 00:31.990
Oh, my God!

00:32.150 --> 00:33.790
Any idea how long
they were down there?

00:33.950 --> 00:35.990
Slade and I saw Jesse,
after he'd gone off.

00:36.150 --> 00:38.230
That means Jesse could have gone
south, not west.

00:38.390 --> 00:39.630
Stop him!

00:41.630 --> 00:43.190
He's someone's son.
But not mine.

00:43.350 --> 00:44.990
Great!
So who have we got in there?

00:47.190 --> 00:48.950
<i>Guess whose DNA was found
at the Newman scene?</i>

00:49.110 --> 00:50.070
Jesse Wells.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.910
Mark. Is everything all right?

01:01.670 --> 01:04.349
Hi. No, probably not.
Can I have a word?

01:10.470 --> 01:13.470
Right, I saw Pru yesterday.
Get this.

01:13.630 --> 01:16.230
She and Slade, on the day that
Jesse disappeared...

01:16.750 --> 01:18.830
they were fooling around
in the woods

01:18.990 --> 01:22.350
and they saw Jesse wandering off
towards the bear pit.

01:23.710 --> 01:26.430
That's the opposite direction
to where your dad

01:26.590 --> 01:28.550
and the rest of the police
said he went.

01:28.710 --> 01:32.630
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Don't worry, I'm having words.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.950
OK, all right, listen.

01:39.110 --> 01:42.110
No, hang on, hang on. I went down
to the bear pit this morning

01:42.270 --> 01:45.150
and beyond it there are roads
and there's houses

01:45.310 --> 01:47.190
and there's a whole raft of people

01:47.350 --> 01:50.190
who were never asked whether
they saw Jesse that day.

01:50.350 --> 01:54.270
Right? Cause when Marosi got picked
up, everyone just stopped looking.

01:54.430 --> 01:57.230
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I do. OK?

01:57.390 --> 01:58.630
- Listen.
- Danny. Danny.

01:58.790 --> 02:00.670
I'm not asking you
to assemble the Avengers,

02:00.830 --> 02:04.110
I'm just asking you to see if Jesse
going in the opposite direction

02:04.270 --> 02:08.590
- was ever investigated.
- Mark, I will. OK? I will.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.510
But you need to step away.
Look at you, you're too involved.

02:11.670 --> 02:13.550
- I'm sorry, what? I'm too involved?
- Yeah.

02:13.710 --> 02:15.230
- He's my brother.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:15.390 --> 02:18.390
When I share things with you, your
parents are suddenly at the hospital.

02:18.550 --> 02:22.070
Worth putting them through that,
was it? No. It was totally avoidable.

02:22.230 --> 02:23.910
Unnecessary.

02:26.710 --> 02:29.390
Look, I've got work to do.
All right?

02:29.550 --> 02:31.230
I'm sure you do, too.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.670
Yeah.

02:46.990 --> 02:49.030
- Partnership contract.
- Oh, yeah.

02:49.190 --> 02:51.990
It'd be great if you're on-board
by the planning meeting.

02:53.990 --> 02:56.990
I mean, if you want to sign now,
I can witness.

02:57.150 --> 02:59.710
Erm, sorry, one sec. Er...

03:01.550 --> 03:04.430
- Sorry, what?
- Partnership contracts.

03:04.590 --> 03:07.590
- If you want to sign...
- Oh, erm...

03:08.710 --> 03:11.870
Yeah, I promised my husband
that I'd run everything past him.

03:12.030 --> 03:13.630
Of course, sure.

03:13.790 --> 03:16.230
But understood.
Sorry, I've just gotta...

03:17.310 --> 03:18.430
Yeah.

03:24.710 --> 03:26.830
Are you... Are you waiting to go in?

03:26.990 --> 03:29.390
- No.
- I'm gonna do you for that!

03:29.550 --> 03:31.430
- Whoa!
- I'm gonna do you!

03:31.590 --> 03:33.310
Hey, you OK?

03:33.470 --> 03:35.710
Yeah, I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

03:43.030 --> 03:46.310
Hey, man. What's going on out there?

03:49.230 --> 03:50.470
Huh?

03:54.350 --> 03:56.350
You're a complete piece of shit.

03:58.710 --> 03:59.870
What?

04:00.030 --> 04:02.670
Nothing...
Nothing really bothers you, does it?

04:05.790 --> 04:09.790
I know that you and Pru
saw Jesse in the woods.

04:10.470 --> 04:13.750
And I know that you chased him
in the opposite direction

04:13.910 --> 04:15.310
to the way everyone was looking!

04:16.269 --> 04:19.029
And you kept that to yourself!

04:19.190 --> 04:20.870
I'm not just talking about
back then,

04:21.029 --> 04:23.790
I'm not talking about when we were 12,
I'm talking about now.

04:23.950 --> 04:27.270
I'm talking about now,
when we think Jesse is alive.

04:29.510 --> 04:34.470
We don't know anything and what we
do know matters. It's everything.

04:34.630 --> 04:37.310
And you know that Jesse
ran in the opposite direction.

04:42.030 --> 04:44.510
Are you seriously not gonna
say anything?

04:47.830 --> 04:50.710
Look, it's got nothing to do with
this Pru thing, all right?

04:50.870 --> 04:53.270
You were 12, you're kids, whatever.

04:57.870 --> 04:59.790
It's about the now.

05:01.070 --> 05:03.590
It's about the "why haven't
you said anything?" now.

05:06.590 --> 05:07.990
I did chase him.

05:11.590 --> 05:12.750
Yeah.

05:14.430 --> 05:17.310
And I stopped because
he disappeared.

05:18.670 --> 05:22.630
And I didn't know
and I don't know which way he went.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.030
I don't.

05:24.910 --> 05:29.470
And I haven't said anything then or
since because there's nothing to add.

05:31.270 --> 05:32.350
OK?

05:33.150 --> 05:35.510
And I wish it was otherwise, I do.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.550
Hey, come on.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.910
I know this is... hurting.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.030
God, I'm sorry.

05:54.710 --> 05:56.990
Sorry for kissing Pru back then,

05:57.150 --> 05:59.790
she was your girlfriend
and I kissed her.

05:59.950 --> 06:03.230
And that...
But I've never been disloyal since.

06:03.390 --> 06:04.670
Ever.

06:05.790 --> 06:09.350
OK? Listen, I hated that.
I hated that.

06:11.190 --> 06:14.950
Slade, you've lied to me
for 20 years.

06:18.630 --> 06:21.270
Mark... come on.

06:25.270 --> 06:26.950
So who are we seeing?

06:27.110 --> 06:29.710
OK, the first girl is Sasha Manley.

06:29.870 --> 06:31.870
She's 22.

06:33.430 --> 06:34.830
Yep.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.070
And that's confirmed?

06:39.510 --> 06:41.270
OK, thanks.

06:41.430 --> 06:42.870
They found Mr X?

06:43.030 --> 06:45.590
No. The last name on the hard drive,
it's a dead end.

06:45.750 --> 06:49.110
Literally. Mr Pilecki died
ten months ago.

06:50.030 --> 06:52.630
And probate's through
with nothing untoward.

06:54.870 --> 06:57.030
What did Selena Callaway
have on her hard drive

06:57.190 --> 06:59.190
that was worth killing her for?

07:01.110 --> 07:02.190
Come on.

07:03.470 --> 07:06.630
Then they said to me, "Your mum and
dad have gone on holidays."

07:06.790 --> 07:10.070
Yeah, we're gonna find them, though.
We'll bring them back.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.270
So, what, four years on
from when I was taken

07:12.430 --> 07:14.430
they can go sit somewhere nice
on a beach?

07:19.790 --> 07:21.030
There was a girl.

07:22.430 --> 07:23.990
A girl who helped him...

07:24.910 --> 07:26.430
helped him get the other girls.

07:27.150 --> 07:28.710
Helped him get me.

07:31.110 --> 07:33.550
- And...
- What was her name?

07:34.710 --> 07:36.270
Her name was Rachel.

07:37.870 --> 07:40.510
I don't know her second name,
I'm sorry.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.470
That's OK.

07:43.270 --> 07:47.110
But this girl...
she looked after us, really.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.990
He only took her out
when he wanted someone new.

07:51.150 --> 07:54.590
Apart from that, she was one of us.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.030
She was held with us.

08:00.550 --> 08:03.390
And then one day she went
and she never came back again.

08:04.350 --> 08:06.150
What happened to her?

08:07.590 --> 08:08.830
Do you know?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.990
It was a long time ago.

08:13.630 --> 08:15.990
And he was raging that night.

08:17.550 --> 08:19.070
Raging.

08:20.110 --> 08:23.470
We reckon that he killed her.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.870
She's probably dead.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.510
No way, that was a flinch.
You did that before.

08:43.669 --> 08:47.110
- You're gonna get a slap.
- Andrew! Stop it!

08:47.270 --> 08:49.150
Yeah, OK!

08:49.310 --> 08:51.110
We're only fooling.

08:52.350 --> 08:55.630
Britnay! We're sorry, Britnay.

09:00.110 --> 09:03.270
She was only six months old
when I was took.

09:05.510 --> 09:07.950
She won't know me, though, will she?

09:13.430 --> 09:14.750
Can I ask her name?

09:18.550 --> 09:19.950
Emma.

09:24.670 --> 09:26.550
Yeah, there... there was a man.

09:27.870 --> 09:30.750
Another man at some point.

09:33.270 --> 09:36.270
I know cause his hands were different,
bigger than...

09:36.430 --> 09:38.110
What about his face?

09:39.350 --> 09:40.790
It was dark.

09:42.550 --> 09:45.510
He did start to... you know.

09:47.230 --> 09:48.990
Then stopped.

09:49.150 --> 09:50.950
And he was...

09:53.710 --> 09:55.150
He was what?

09:56.790 --> 09:58.670
Gentle.

10:03.750 --> 10:07.670
Oh, I've left my phone in the...
What?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.670
The guy that Jane talked about,

10:12.830 --> 10:14.990
you know, the one
with the bigger hands?

10:15.150 --> 10:17.030
The gentle man.

10:18.670 --> 10:20.950
What if that's Jesse?

10:23.670 --> 10:25.950
Yeah, that crossed my mind, too.

10:28.150 --> 10:31.190
Your dad ran the investigation
into Jesse's disappearance.

10:31.350 --> 10:33.950
Have you
checked his old case files?

11:28.150 --> 11:30.990
No, no, no, no, no, no....

11:56.750 --> 11:59.070
- Ally...
- <i>I'm at Newman's house.</i>

11:59.230 --> 12:01.110
It's like a circus down here.

12:02.030 --> 12:04.510
The forensics think
they've found something,

12:04.670 --> 12:06.550
a patch of ground that's
been disturbed.

12:06.710 --> 12:08.430
All right, I'm on my way.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.670
Simon. What you doing here, bud?

12:17.350 --> 12:18.910
I haven't heard from you.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.070
Which could mean there's no news

12:21.230 --> 12:23.870
or alternatively,
you're not doing anything.

12:24.030 --> 12:26.030
But either way,
my dad's still missing.

12:26.190 --> 12:27.630
How did you find out where I live?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.750
My mum still has your address
on her phone.

12:29.910 --> 12:34.790
Right. Well, listen, my dad,
he's cooking some breakfast.

12:35.350 --> 12:37.710
So are you gonna come in?
You gonna come in?

12:37.870 --> 12:38.950
- OK.
- All right.

12:40.230 --> 12:42.030
Dad, will you put some clothes on?

12:42.190 --> 12:44.510
I'm not showing anything
and I like it. Oh, hello.

12:44.670 --> 12:46.670
Sorry, don't mind me.
It's the wife's.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.950
Oh, you're all right.
I have Asperger's, too.

12:49.110 --> 12:52.950
Right, let's get down to business.

12:53.110 --> 12:55.310
I've brought everything
I could find on my dad.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.670
Thing is, Simon, your mum says
your dad often goes off.

12:57.830 --> 12:59.870
She means
he often doesn't come home.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.270
Which is true,
but of course I see him every day.

13:02.430 --> 13:05.670
Well, not every day but most weekdays
in term times, you know what I mean?

13:05.830 --> 13:07.910
So he picks you up after school,
does he?

13:08.070 --> 13:11.350
you really haven't been trying,
have you?

13:11.510 --> 13:14.870
My father teaches at my school.
He teaches geography.

13:15.030 --> 13:17.910
Ah, commiserations, son. We had
a boy like that in our class.

13:18.070 --> 13:20.870
His mum... Well, first of all,
she was a bitch of the highest order

13:21.030 --> 13:25.110
but was also our biology teacher
and that kid got crap from all sides.

13:26.470 --> 13:27.750
I like my dad.

13:28.510 --> 13:29.630
OK.

13:30.550 --> 13:35.510
Right, well, Simon, I apologise
for my lacklustre performance

13:35.670 --> 13:38.310
up until now
and I promise to make amends.

13:38.470 --> 13:41.150
Good. Let's start afresh.

13:52.950 --> 13:54.630
- OK...
- What are we doing?

13:54.790 --> 13:57.150
You said you were taking me out
for lunch. Talk to me.

13:57.310 --> 14:00.270
OK. We're looking for
a new school for our daughter.

14:01.510 --> 14:03.190
- What?
- Yeah.

14:03.350 --> 14:06.190
I'm actually trying to track a
geography teacher, Kenton Marshall,

14:06.350 --> 14:09.350
but if I turn up here on my own
and I start asking questions

14:09.510 --> 14:11.790
this is gonna look suspicious,
and with the kids,

14:11.950 --> 14:13.830
I'm just gonna look like a pervert.

14:13.990 --> 14:16.350
But with my lovely wife...

14:16.510 --> 14:19.030
God...

14:19.670 --> 14:21.190
Come on.

14:27.670 --> 14:30.230
Pru? Come on, come help me out.

14:36.550 --> 14:40.990
Excuse me. Hi. Do any of you guys
do geography by any chance?

14:41.150 --> 14:44.270
Geography, no? Know a geography
teacher called Mr Marshall?

14:44.430 --> 14:45.910
Mr Kenton Marshall?

14:46.070 --> 14:48.510
- No? OK, thank you.
- Thank you.

14:51.310 --> 14:53.230
Can you ask the next ones?

14:54.830 --> 14:57.670
Please, Pru.
Come on. Mr Marshall.

15:01.910 --> 15:06.830
Hi, girls. Excuse me,
erm... any geography students here?

15:06.990 --> 15:08.830
Why do you ask?

15:08.990 --> 15:11.590
Mr Marshall? Mr Kenton Marshall?

15:11.750 --> 15:14.030
No? Do you know him?

15:14.190 --> 15:17.670
- We're just trying to locate him.
- Try the store cupboard.

15:17.830 --> 15:21.190
Yeah, but knock before you go in
in case he's doing Alexa again.

15:21.350 --> 15:22.510
Shut up!

15:23.310 --> 15:26.150
Sorry.
He's not been in all week, so...

15:28.470 --> 15:30.670
- Thanks.
- Thank you, guys. Cheers.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.830
Hey, hey.
Erm... so you know Mr Marshall?

15:35.990 --> 15:37.670
Are you a policeman?

15:37.830 --> 15:39.230
Should I be?

15:39.870 --> 15:42.070
Chrissie! Over here!

15:42.230 --> 15:43.950
- Sorry, I've got to go.
- OK.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.670
All that back there, about Alexa,
it's just gossip.

15:47.830 --> 15:50.230
- You know, a joke really.
- OK. No problem.

15:50.390 --> 15:52.750
- Sorry.
- Thank you. Bye bye.

15:53.630 --> 15:56.310
So Mr Marshall and Alexa?

15:56.470 --> 15:58.230
You're interested now, aren't you?

15:58.390 --> 16:00.350
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Come on.

16:00.510 --> 16:02.430
How old's our daughter again?

16:13.190 --> 16:15.150
Do you think it could be Jesse?

16:16.270 --> 16:20.070
They found Jesse's DNA on Newman's
shirt. His body's been here a while.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.590
If it is Jesse,
it doesn't make any sense.

16:23.230 --> 16:26.110
There's a lot about this
that doesn't make any sense.

16:26.270 --> 16:29.350
The lab are fast-tracking the DNA.
We should know by tomorrow.

16:33.550 --> 16:35.510
Jesse could still be dead, though.

16:35.670 --> 16:38.790
Then why was his DNA found at
the Selena Callaway murder scene?

16:43.630 --> 16:47.470
Being a popular school we do have
a very strict catchment area rule,

16:47.630 --> 16:51.750
so I'll let you have the map because
proof of residency is essential.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.750
That's excellent, thank you.
What's this building over there?

16:54.910 --> 16:57.310
- Music department.
- Oh, that's great.

16:57.470 --> 17:00.110
Erm... we should go and check
that out shouldn't we, darling?

17:00.270 --> 17:02.390
Triona, she's erm, grade 7.

17:02.550 --> 17:04.550
On what instrument?

17:06.670 --> 17:09.349
- Piano.
- Grade 7 at 15?

17:09.510 --> 17:12.430
- Very good.
- I need the loo, so I'm just gonna...

17:12.589 --> 17:14.710
I saw one inside,
I'm gonna head back in.

17:14.869 --> 17:16.829
You guys go ahead, OK?
I'll catch you up.

17:16.990 --> 17:18.069
Go on.

18:16.070 --> 18:17.790
In case he's doing Alexa again.

18:21.430 --> 18:22.510
Alexa...

18:26.110 --> 18:28.790
Sort by first name...

18:43.230 --> 18:46.030
I'm so sorry... so sorry I'm late.

18:46.190 --> 18:48.630
Got a little bit lost.
We're gonna have to dash off.

18:48.790 --> 18:51.470
But thank you so much for showing us
the school. It's lovely.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.030
- We'll be in touch.
- Bye. Take care.

18:55.910 --> 18:57.750
- Come on.
- Thanks for that.

18:57.910 --> 18:59.470
Come on, it's not that bad.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.590
I couldn't find anything
on Kenton Marshall

19:01.750 --> 19:04.670
but there is only one Alexa,
in the fifth form.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.830
Got her address.

19:08.790 --> 19:10.430
Let's see what they have to say.

19:10.590 --> 19:13.990
So, what, we go to
this girl's house and say, what?

19:22.390 --> 19:24.470
- Mr and Mrs Mills?
- Yes?

19:24.630 --> 19:27.310
We're the parents of one of Alexa's
friends from Highfield.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.430
Don't worry, she's not in trouble.
We just want to speak to Alexa

19:30.590 --> 19:32.630
- about our daughter.
- I'm sorry, who's Alexa?

19:32.790 --> 19:35.230
You've got a daughter at
Highfield Comprehensive, right?

19:35.390 --> 19:38.670
- No, no. We don't have a daughter.
- We don't have any children.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.550
- Oh...
- Oh.

19:40.710 --> 19:44.630
OK, sorry. Really sorry.

19:44.790 --> 19:46.270
So sorry.

19:49.830 --> 19:52.830
- You got the address wrong.
- Mm-mn.

19:52.990 --> 19:57.270
Not the wrong address.
Mr and Mrs Mills as in "Alexa Mills."

19:58.870 --> 20:01.790
- I'm going back to the school.
- No. No, no.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.190
I've got work.
I've got a surgery this afternoon.

20:04.950 --> 20:06.630
So this is it, is it?

20:07.430 --> 20:10.230
This is divorce?
You don't like being married to me?

20:10.390 --> 20:12.910
You don't like having a 15-year-old
daughter with me?

20:13.710 --> 20:15.350
You can buy your own lunch.

20:17.030 --> 20:18.710
Slade.

20:19.350 --> 20:21.230
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.990
- All right?
- Yeah, good.

20:25.310 --> 20:27.630
- You?
- Yeah.

20:36.910 --> 20:37.990
Erm...

20:39.750 --> 20:41.790
I'm gonna go and talk
to the police.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.510
Brit...

20:44.750 --> 20:46.790
I've been thinking about it, and...

20:46.950 --> 20:48.190
Well, not long enough.

20:48.350 --> 20:51.790
Yeah. Trust me, plenty long enough.

20:53.510 --> 20:55.070
It's out in the open now.

20:55.790 --> 20:59.390
I did what I did, Slade.
I helped trap those girls.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.950
And I made them feel safe.

21:02.110 --> 21:05.990
- Listen, Brit...
- No. Please, I've gone through this.

21:10.030 --> 21:12.470
This is like my fate, right?

21:13.990 --> 21:17.470
I've... got to put my hands up
and face what I did.

21:20.070 --> 21:23.670
But what about was done to you?
Hm?

21:24.790 --> 21:26.590
Brit, you don't have to do this.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.310
If you go to the police,
they will eat you alive.

21:29.470 --> 21:31.830
No, no, I'm talking now. OK?

21:31.990 --> 21:35.030
And you're wrong, Brit,
you are wrong!

21:36.510 --> 21:39.310
You're making your amends,
you're doing it every day.

21:40.070 --> 21:45.150
And we can't replace what you give
to the kids here. Never.

21:45.310 --> 21:48.110
So whatever it is you need
to get through this,

21:48.270 --> 21:50.950
- I will get it for you, OK?
- I've made up my mind.

21:54.670 --> 21:58.190
OK, listen. I want you to do this
for me. I want you to think again.

21:59.150 --> 22:00.630
And then think again.

22:00.790 --> 22:04.350
And if, in an hour's time, you still
want to go through with it...

22:05.830 --> 22:07.870
then I'll drive you there.

22:11.110 --> 22:12.270
OK.

22:16.150 --> 22:19.310
Hi. Sorry, I think my wife has left
her phone in the music department.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.550
Did you guys stop off
anywhere together?

22:21.710 --> 22:23.230
No.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.790
I'll go and check. Take a seat.

22:27.950 --> 22:29.910
That'd be great.
Thank you very much.

22:30.070 --> 22:32.070
Wendy, I'll be two minutes.

22:46.510 --> 22:49.830
Hello?

22:52.270 --> 22:53.990
OK, I'm on my way.

23:25.910 --> 23:28.190
Come on, come on, come on,
come on...

23:57.150 --> 23:58.470
It's not there.

24:00.110 --> 24:03.310
Really?
I'm so sorry about that.

24:09.750 --> 24:12.590
Oh, we'll erm... we'll be in touch.

24:19.550 --> 24:20.830
Bye, then.

24:50.190 --> 24:52.630
You lied to me, Mr Mills.
Where's Alexa?

24:53.910 --> 24:56.390
She's not my daughter.
I've never even met her.

24:56.550 --> 24:59.350
- <i>Five minutes, OK?</i>
- Yeah, fine.

24:59.510 --> 25:01.510
Well, how about if I ask your wife,
then?

25:01.670 --> 25:03.750
No, no, no... Look.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.070
Look... I got caught, all right?

25:07.230 --> 25:10.070
You know, with a call girl.

25:10.710 --> 25:14.830
You know, a prostitute.
There was this man there suddenly

25:14.990 --> 25:18.430
and he said, "Sign this and sign
that or we'll tell your wife."

25:19.670 --> 25:23.630
So I did.
But you mustn't tell her, all right?

25:26.070 --> 25:27.950
When you say "this and that"...

25:29.150 --> 25:30.510
I'll show you.

25:31.150 --> 25:32.830
I won't be a second.

25:43.830 --> 25:45.750
So who's the guy that made you
sign all these?

25:45.910 --> 25:48.790
Oh, he's a what do you call it?
He's a pimp.

25:49.350 --> 25:51.390
Goes by the name of Payne.

25:52.150 --> 25:55.390
I mean, it's nothing,
it's an enrolment form.

25:55.550 --> 25:57.550
Is it so bad?

25:58.670 --> 26:01.830
Was a guy called Kenton Marshall
ever mentioned?

26:06.870 --> 26:07.870
<i>You OK?</i>

26:08.030 --> 26:09.670
<i>Yeah, I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?</i>

26:23.230 --> 26:25.190
Brit, this is madness.
Come on, please.

26:25.350 --> 26:27.550
Let's just... Let's just go, please.

26:28.910 --> 26:31.150
I'm gonna go and do this on my own,
all right?

26:33.310 --> 26:35.950
I owe it to those girls
to say what I did.

26:39.630 --> 26:42.230
They'll crucify you in there.

26:44.390 --> 26:46.390
They'll do what they need to.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.030
Just like I did.

26:51.070 --> 26:52.750
Just like I'm doing now.

27:00.750 --> 27:01.990
Brit...

27:05.550 --> 27:07.230
My name's not Brit.

27:09.910 --> 27:11.150
It's Rachel.

27:32.790 --> 27:35.070
Hi. Can I please speak
to Danny Kenwood?

27:35.230 --> 27:38.310
DS Kenwood?
He's not here at the moment.

27:38.470 --> 27:40.750
Oh, that's OK. I'll wait.

27:59.550 --> 28:02.630
Jesus Christ!

28:04.230 --> 28:06.230
You all right, mate?

28:17.510 --> 28:19.470
You stay away from Alexa.

28:52.470 --> 28:54.270
OK, here you go.

28:58.350 --> 28:59.550
Hey.

28:59.710 --> 29:02.190
I need you to get me an address
from a licence plate number.

29:02.350 --> 29:04.590
Come on, man. What did I tell you
about packing away?

29:04.750 --> 29:07.110
I know, but I really need your help.

29:08.230 --> 29:10.870
You know you're putting me
in a really difficult position here?

29:11.030 --> 29:13.990
Danny, I wouldn't ask you
if I didn't need it.

29:15.270 --> 29:17.870
All right.
Text me the licence plate number.

29:29.190 --> 29:31.270
Your families are waiting for you.

29:42.590 --> 29:45.190
Hey. You're alive!

29:45.350 --> 29:47.870
Hey... what are you doing here?

29:50.350 --> 29:51.470
No.

29:53.070 --> 29:56.110
No, no, look, look...
you're not to blame.

29:57.470 --> 29:58.790
We won't say anything.

30:00.510 --> 30:03.510
Just go. Just go.

30:07.110 --> 30:10.190
- Jane?
- Yeah, sorry. I'm here.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.910
- I'm sorry, I was just...
- It's OK.

30:16.110 --> 30:17.710
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- <i>Izzy.</i>

30:17.870 --> 30:20.390
<i>That's a nice name.</i>

30:24.350 --> 30:25.910
So you and Sasha are down here.

30:27.350 --> 30:30.110
Izzy? It's this room over here.

30:30.270 --> 30:32.230
- I need the loo.
- OK.

30:32.390 --> 30:34.070
- Er... do you mind showing her?
- Yeah.

30:46.710 --> 30:49.230
Sorry, I need a tampon.
The machine's not working.

30:49.390 --> 30:51.510
- OK, hang on.
- It's urgent.

30:52.870 --> 30:55.510
OK. Wait there
and I'll go and get you one.

31:34.230 --> 31:36.790
I'm so sorry, Mark.
Honestly, I...

31:37.750 --> 31:40.070
Me, too.
Me, too.

31:46.590 --> 31:48.070
What happened to your face?

31:48.750 --> 31:51.310
I got jumped this morning
by some random guy.

31:51.470 --> 31:52.750
- What?
- Yeah.

31:52.910 --> 31:54.790
I just got his address from Danny.

31:54.950 --> 31:57.710
- Do you fancy a drive?
- Yeah.

32:17.190 --> 32:20.110
There you go. That's his car.

32:20.270 --> 32:22.270
Yeah, he's in there.

32:23.870 --> 32:25.870
So now we wait.

33:03.230 --> 33:06.150
That's Porter & Starr. This is
where Selena Callaway worked.

33:06.310 --> 33:07.430
Yeah.

33:07.590 --> 33:09.670
Right. No. You wait here.

33:09.830 --> 33:11.190
I'll go.

33:23.550 --> 33:27.790
Hi. Rodent eradication.
Remember?

33:28.710 --> 33:31.270
We're just here to do
a discreet follow-up call.

33:31.430 --> 33:33.910
Can I er...?

34:13.909 --> 34:15.070
Hello?

34:17.429 --> 34:18.429
Hello?

34:21.389 --> 34:22.590
Can I help you?

34:23.790 --> 34:27.350
Yes. Can I leave these with you?

34:33.550 --> 34:35.989
So what happened in there?
What's going on?

34:36.150 --> 34:40.630
Nothing. I got in there and...
I lost him. He just vanished.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.989
What's the connection?
What's going on, man?

34:53.469 --> 34:58.790
<i>♪ Don't take your love away from me ♪</i>

34:59.670 --> 35:02.830
<i>♪ Don't you leave my heart
in misery ♪</i>

35:04.190 --> 35:06.390
<i>♪ If you go, then I'll be blue ♪</i>

35:06.550 --> 35:09.910
<i>♪ Cause breaking up is hard to do ♪</i>

35:10.070 --> 35:11.190
Here he is!

35:11.670 --> 35:13.910
- Hi!
- That's beautiful!

35:14.070 --> 35:15.150
Nice surprise.

35:15.310 --> 35:18.990
Well, your mum and dad were playing
me Neil Sedaka who says...

35:19.150 --> 35:20.150
Breaking up is hard to do.

35:20.310 --> 35:24.270
He was wrong cause it's easy as pie
and we are much happier now.

35:24.430 --> 35:26.350
- Much happier.
- And I was wondering

35:26.510 --> 35:29.350
if you wanted to have a late lunch.

35:30.470 --> 35:32.990
Oh. As in a... very late lunch.

35:33.390 --> 35:37.870
Yeah. As in a... really late lunch

35:38.030 --> 35:40.790
with a little bit of nightclubbing,
maybe some dancing.

35:40.950 --> 35:43.070
<i>♪ Cause I wanna be happy ♪</i>

35:43.830 --> 35:46.910
- I can do that.
- Yeah? Whoo!

36:12.590 --> 36:15.430
- Who's there?
- It's just me, Dad.

36:16.550 --> 36:17.910
It's good to see you.

36:23.310 --> 36:26.030
Hey, Dad... please, just...

36:26.910 --> 36:29.430
These files, yeah?

36:30.310 --> 36:32.510
What was in these folders?

36:36.430 --> 36:40.630
These... these folders.
These are the Jesse Wells folders.

36:48.190 --> 36:49.590
OK.

36:50.230 --> 36:53.310
OK.

36:55.310 --> 36:58.510
I'm gonna tell you something
pretty important.

36:58.670 --> 36:59.590
OK.

36:59.750 --> 37:04.190
Because it was said to me
face-to-face.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.350
I find it hard to believe, but...

37:11.990 --> 37:14.550
Jesus wants me for a fisherman.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.270
What?

37:34.030 --> 37:35.630
You've got a fat lip.

37:35.790 --> 37:39.190
Oh, yeah, I know.
I got jumped in the street today.

37:40.790 --> 37:42.270
- What?
- Yeah.

37:43.030 --> 37:44.830
Then this guy sprang out of nowhere
and saved me,

37:44.990 --> 37:46.710
ran off before I could thank him.

37:47.310 --> 37:49.510
What, like Batman?

37:49.670 --> 37:52.910
Ah! That's who it was,
it was Batman!

37:57.510 --> 37:59.870
I was gonna say that erm...

38:00.710 --> 38:03.310
it's really nice being with you again,
you know?

38:03.470 --> 38:05.990
Nice seeing you again
after all these years.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.350
And it's great making you cry again.
I mean, that's...

38:10.510 --> 38:12.710
Excuse me.
Can I get two shots, please?

38:12.870 --> 38:14.990
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

38:18.870 --> 38:20.950
There's erm...

38:22.230 --> 38:25.750
There's stuff
that I need to tell you.

38:25.910 --> 38:26.870
OK.

38:27.030 --> 38:30.270
There's stuff that I need to unpack.

38:31.270 --> 38:33.190
You know when you move house

38:33.350 --> 38:36.710
and the removal van drives away
and you're just sort of left

38:36.870 --> 38:40.070
with all these boxes and you don't
know which one to open first

38:40.230 --> 38:42.390
- because you didn't label them?
- Right.

38:42.550 --> 38:44.150
- It's like that.
- OK.

38:44.310 --> 38:46.070
Well, let's just...

38:46.230 --> 38:48.390
- We'll just take them as they come.
- OK.

38:48.550 --> 38:50.990
Go for it. What's in the first one?

38:51.150 --> 38:52.150
Erm...

38:54.030 --> 38:55.990
I married the wrong man.

38:57.590 --> 38:59.270
Not that box.

39:07.110 --> 39:08.990
I don't know what I'm doing, OK?

39:09.150 --> 39:10.350
OK.

39:11.150 --> 39:13.590
No, I mean not at all.

39:15.030 --> 39:17.150
And it's just been like this...

39:18.070 --> 39:19.310
for ages.

39:22.350 --> 39:24.510
Maybe for ever.

39:25.270 --> 39:28.350
I mean, why was I in America?
What was I doing there?

39:28.950 --> 39:31.710
- You went with your mum.
- Yeah, right.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.870
Just one day I woke up,
I was like: "I have to get home.

39:35.030 --> 39:38.150
I have to get home right now.
Not in a bit. Now."

39:38.310 --> 39:41.910
And Stuart was really amenable,
and here I am.

39:42.470 --> 39:46.150
- Well, I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad!

39:46.310 --> 39:49.790
I'm glad! But I haven't told Stuart

39:49.950 --> 39:52.710
that I'm not gonna take
that GP partnership

39:52.870 --> 39:55.430
cause I don't want to be
a private doctor.

39:56.070 --> 39:57.750
And he won't get that at all.

39:58.230 --> 40:01.590
Especially when I say I'm working
with Slade in the shelter for free.

40:01.750 --> 40:04.310
- Yes, he told me that. That's great.
- Yeah.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.390
It's kind of like the old me,
isn't it?

40:06.550 --> 40:10.630
Yeah, I mean, working in the shelter,
that's... Thanks, mate.

40:13.230 --> 40:16.710
- Just forget Stu. OK?
- OK.

40:16.870 --> 40:18.230
Here's to you.

42:29.310 --> 42:32.150
I was Mrs Wells today for a while.

42:34.550 --> 42:35.990
We had a daughter.
