00:07.013 --> 00:10.085
You go to sleep, Nicky. I'm gonna
go downstairs and make sure...

00:10.253 --> 00:13.165
...that Geoffrey remembered
to put out some cookies for Santa.

00:13.373 --> 00:16.171
Don't eat too many, okay, Daddy?

00:18.093 --> 00:21.642
Daddy, can you tell me
about the four middle names?

00:21.973 --> 00:24.533
Come on, Nicky, you've heard
that story a hundred times.

00:24.733 --> 00:28.169
I know it,
but I forget a lot of it, please.

00:28.333 --> 00:31.803
Oh, all right. All right. Let me see.

00:31.973 --> 00:34.851
Most children have one middle name.

00:35.013 --> 00:38.323
But, you, my boy, have four.

00:38.493 --> 00:41.485
And it all began the night
before you were christened.

00:41.653 --> 00:44.213
Yes, a lot of things
were different back then.

00:44.533 --> 00:47.252
Say, Uncle Phil,
can I borrow 50 bucks, man?

00:47.773 --> 00:50.048
Of course, some things never change.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

02:01.253 --> 02:04.962
Yes, it was Christmas Eve, 1993.

02:05.133 --> 02:07.601
Everyone's favorite time of year.

02:14.413 --> 02:17.689
You know, these popcorn strings
are looking a little skimpy.

02:17.853 --> 02:21.323
But you wouldn't know nothing
about that would you, Uncle Phil?

02:22.373 --> 02:24.250
I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:24.613 --> 02:28.925
And I suppose this is the one-armed man
The Fugitive was looking for, huh?

02:40.013 --> 02:42.163
Hey, all right, thank you.

02:43.693 --> 02:45.251
Yeah.

02:48.253 --> 02:52.485
Hey, little fellow, Santa let you out
of the workshop early?

02:52.693 --> 02:56.925
Oh, you like my outfit?
I had jingle bells sewn into my cuffs.

03:03.413 --> 03:05.483
Geoffrey, I need
my Santa suit pressed.

03:05.653 --> 03:09.851
We can't have Nicky thinking Kriss
Kringle doesn't keep a sharp crease.

03:10.173 --> 03:14.291
Oh, but it's all right for him to think
Santa's only three feet tall.

03:17.773 --> 03:21.209
- Hey, Hil, Ash.
- What happened to your coat?

03:21.413 --> 03:23.802
I was mauled in the Saks
shoe department.

03:23.973 --> 03:26.965
You need a license to drive,
but they'll let anyone shop.

03:28.813 --> 03:32.169
Boyz II Men were at the mall,
and they autographed my new CD.

03:32.333 --> 03:36.292
Oh, and I got Nicky
the cutest present for his christening.

03:36.453 --> 03:38.967
You may have gotten the cutest,
but I got him the best.

03:39.133 --> 03:41.522
Don't be so sure about that, bucko.

03:43.853 --> 03:48.449
Children, there is no point in competing
over who got Nicky the best present.

03:48.653 --> 03:50.962
That's right,
because you'll all lose to me.

03:51.493 --> 03:54.405
Oh, yeah? Well, wait right here.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.412
I thought we was gonna wait...

03:59.573 --> 04:02.963
...but we're having a gift-off now?
Okay, that's cool. Move, move.

04:04.573 --> 04:06.245
Hey, G.

04:06.533 --> 04:11.561
Wait till you see the gift
that I got Nicky for his christening.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.444
<i>Hey there, G
I don 't mean to be rude</i>

04:27.613 --> 04:31.083
<i>But take your jelly-roll butt
And go get me some food</i>

04:35.973 --> 04:39.409
So that's where
the cereal box tops went.

04:39.573 --> 04:42.007
What are you talking about?
This is a great present.

04:42.173 --> 04:46.769
Oh, no. The 18-carat gold rattle
from your uncle is a great present.

04:46.933 --> 04:51.085
The handwoven silk sleeper suit
from Miss Hilary is a great present.

04:51.253 --> 04:54.563
That is a hand puppet.

04:55.533 --> 04:58.889
Well, I can count on Carlton
to make me look good.

04:59.053 --> 05:01.521
He's so cheap, he'd probably
make Nicky a vest...

05:01.693 --> 05:04.287
...out of the lint
from his pocket or something.

05:10.053 --> 05:12.965
Hey, is Nicky gonna love this or what?

05:22.693 --> 05:25.161
- Will.
- I wasn't doing nothing.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.483
You're not gonna believe this.

05:27.653 --> 05:30.326
Watch what happens
when I play my Boyz II Men CD.

05:42.093 --> 05:45.130
Oh, man. Yo, me and this kid
are definitely blood.

05:45.293 --> 05:48.524
Let me tell you what used to knock me
out of my high chair. Remember:

05:51.133 --> 05:52.407
Good jam, right?

05:52.613 --> 05:56.083
- Greetings, y'all.
- What's up, Jazz?

05:57.653 --> 05:59.928
I brought little Ricky
his christening gift.

06:00.853 --> 06:03.003
Man, a cheap christening gift.

06:03.173 --> 06:04.652
Hey, you mind if I take a peek?

06:05.053 --> 06:07.044
Go ahead, get your peek on.

06:11.253 --> 06:13.403
Jazz, this is a Rolex.

06:15.213 --> 06:17.283
Santa left it in the men's room.

06:18.973 --> 06:21.692
So, what'd you get him?

06:22.333 --> 06:25.484
Oh, l... Shoot, man.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.292
I got him a real good gift.

06:34.613 --> 06:36.808
I got him them.

06:37.213 --> 06:40.285
Them? You got him a Boyz II Men CD?

06:40.453 --> 06:42.762
No, look, come here. Come here.

06:44.053 --> 06:45.964
I got him Boyz II Men, man.

06:46.133 --> 06:50.126
I used to hang with them back in Philly.
They're going to sing at the christening.

06:50.293 --> 06:54.889
- Will, that's wonderful.
- What's wonderful?

06:55.093 --> 06:57.482
Will got Boyz II Men
to sing at Nicky's christening.

06:57.653 --> 07:00.884
- I can't wait to tell Reverend Boyd.
- Aunt Viv... Whoa, woman, look...

07:01.053 --> 07:02.452
I've got to tell...

07:03.013 --> 07:05.322
Hey, hey, hey.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.370
Come back here!

07:08.013 --> 07:11.210
Well, this is a christening
your family won't forget.

07:11.773 --> 07:13.684
Come back here!

07:26.053 --> 07:28.886
<i>As usual, Will had put
his foot in his mouth.</i>

07:29.053 --> 07:33.729
<i>But lucky for him, Boyz II Men
were in town recording a radio special.</i>

07:34.333 --> 07:36.403
<i>Will managed to sneak in.</i>

09:11.773 --> 09:13.570
This should be cool, man.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.443
Oh, man. Let it snow, man.

09:20.653 --> 09:22.166
Let it...

09:22.373 --> 09:25.126
This is a dirty studio.
You all got bugs.

09:25.533 --> 09:26.966
This is a closed session.
You gotta step.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.931
- Hey, hold up, man. Listen, I know them.
- How was that, man?

09:30.133 --> 09:33.921
Hey, y'all. Y'all, hey,
I'm from Philly, man. West Philly!

09:34.773 --> 09:38.083
Hey, you know, cheese steaks,
Liberty Bell, man, West Philly!

09:38.453 --> 09:39.681
Get rid of him, Charlie.

09:39.893 --> 09:42.168
Nate, I used to play ball
with Jerome Brook, man.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.206
- You know what? He do look familiar.
- I do?

09:45.933 --> 09:49.721
I mean, I do. Get off of me, get off me.
He said I looked familiar, man.

09:50.173 --> 09:54.052
But it ain't from basketball, though.
You know Nicie Taylor, don't you?

09:54.773 --> 09:56.491
Hey, I guess I do look familiar.

09:56.653 --> 09:58.609
Yeah, I used to date
Nicie back in the day.

09:58.773 --> 10:03.164
Listen, I stole her from this old
four-eyed, big-lipped dude, right?

10:03.333 --> 10:05.801
Used to be singing these
stupid songs on the corner.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.089
- It was him and his three...
- Yeah.

10:10.613 --> 10:14.083
- Sisters. It was him and three girls.
- You don't know how much I loved her.

10:14.253 --> 10:16.369
I cried myself to sleep
every night about that.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.730
Did I say I was from Philly?
I'm from Pittsburgh, man. Go, Steelers.

10:19.893 --> 10:22.726
Stealing. That's what you did.
You see his face, memorize it.

10:22.893 --> 10:25.691
- We don't wanna see him here again.
- Okay, Romeo, let's go.

10:25.853 --> 10:28.287
Look, do you guys validate? My car...

10:31.733 --> 10:33.212
So in less than five minutes...

10:33.373 --> 10:36.922
...cousin Will had totally alienated
everyone in the group.

10:37.093 --> 10:39.527
Meanwhile, back at the house...

10:39.733 --> 10:43.806
Daddy, I hate to interrupt,
but I have to go potty.

10:44.333 --> 10:47.564
Okay. Be sure you're back here
in two and a half minutes.

10:47.733 --> 10:49.007
Go on.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.684
- Remember to put the seat back down?
- Do you?

11:02.213 --> 11:03.885
Good point.

11:04.093 --> 11:05.492
Anyway, where was I?

11:05.653 --> 11:07.291
Oh, yeah.

11:07.453 --> 11:09.921
Cousin Will had gotten himself
into quite a fix.

11:10.133 --> 11:14.126
So he did what most men do when they
get their backs against the wall.

11:14.293 --> 11:16.011
He begged.

11:17.053 --> 11:19.851
Nicie. Nicie, Nicie, baby. Nicie, baby.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.402
Look, could you just talk
to Nate, please?

11:22.573 --> 11:23.801
No?

11:23.973 --> 11:27.602
Where's your Christmas spirit?
You're a nun for God's sake.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.769
Aunt Vy just arrived and she needs you
to take her suitcase upstairs.

11:36.933 --> 11:39.652
Then put out another plate of cookies,
make fresh eggnog...

11:39.813 --> 11:42.611
...and replace that broken
string of lights on the tree.

11:45.173 --> 11:49.132
And wipe that frown off your face.
It's Christmas.

11:53.013 --> 11:56.528
You know, I am really getting sick
and tired of Geoffrey's attitude.

11:56.693 --> 11:59.332
Well, you have to imagine
how he feels this time of year.

11:59.493 --> 12:02.405
Wash this, carry that,
cook this, clean that.

12:02.813 --> 12:04.849
Ashley, what's your point?

12:05.373 --> 12:07.648
We work him too hard
this time of year.

12:07.813 --> 12:09.405
We should get him a present.

12:10.613 --> 12:13.127
What am I gonna get him, a mop?

12:14.333 --> 12:16.005
- Let me take your coat.
- Thank you.

12:16.173 --> 12:19.210
Oh, Vy, you look wonderful.

12:19.373 --> 12:21.648
- What, did you lose some weight?
- Oh, yes, I did.

12:21.813 --> 12:24.407
And I guess you found it.

12:25.213 --> 12:28.569
Okay, now I remember
where Will gets it from, right?

12:31.773 --> 12:35.049
How come ain't nobody tell me
Halle Berry was going to be up in here?

12:36.453 --> 12:38.409
That's my mommy.

12:38.933 --> 12:41.083
Hi, baby.

12:47.213 --> 12:49.204
Oh, all right, Geoffrey, I'll get it.

12:49.373 --> 12:53.207
Your generosity knows no bounds, sir.

12:55.813 --> 12:58.532
Oh, Mom, it feels so good
to have you here.

12:58.693 --> 13:00.445
- Yes.
- Listen, listen.

13:00.653 --> 13:02.962
- I got a little problem.
- What's the matter, baby?

13:03.133 --> 13:05.408
Well, it's about Nicky's christening.

13:05.613 --> 13:07.171
Don't you say another word, baby.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.483
Your Aunt Vivian told me
what you're doing.

13:09.653 --> 13:13.009
When that group stands up to sing,
I'm gonna turn to the congregation...

13:13.173 --> 13:17.007
...and tell them,
that gift is from my boy.

13:19.733 --> 13:22.247
Oh, damn.

13:22.973 --> 13:25.441
Come on, Will,
turn that frown upside down.

13:25.613 --> 13:30.164
Santa's gonna be here soon,
and no one can resist jolly old St. Nick.

13:33.493 --> 13:36.371
You know what? You're right, Carlton.

13:36.533 --> 13:38.489
You're a genius, man.

13:41.933 --> 13:43.685
- The house looks beautiful.
- Thank you.

13:43.853 --> 13:46.526
- Merry Christmas, Aunt Helen.
- Merry Christmas, baby.

13:46.933 --> 13:48.651
Let me take this.

13:49.453 --> 13:53.605
It's so good to be with the family
for the holiday season.

13:53.773 --> 13:56.924
Now, where's my big sister,
Vy? Diva?

13:57.133 --> 13:59.966
- Diva!
- Diva! Hey!

14:03.333 --> 14:06.325
Helen, it is so good to see you.

14:06.533 --> 14:09.331
Yes, likewise.

14:15.253 --> 14:17.767
I think I'll go change.

14:18.533 --> 14:19.761
Vy, honey.

14:19.933 --> 14:21.889
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Good to see you.

14:22.053 --> 14:25.602
Excuse me just a minute. Helen,
let me talk to you just a minute.

14:25.773 --> 14:27.411
Wait a minute, Helen.

14:27.573 --> 14:30.565
Excuse me, what are you wearing
to the christening?

14:30.733 --> 14:33.372
If I'm gonna be godmother,
I don't wanna walk in church...

14:33.533 --> 14:35.649
<i>...Iooking like the Full House twins.</i>

14:35.853 --> 14:38.413
Honey, I think
your wig is on too tight.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.249
I'm gonna be Nicky's godmother.

14:42.453 --> 14:44.808
Vivian asked me herself.

14:44.973 --> 14:47.567
Wait a minute, she asked me too.

14:47.733 --> 14:50.930
I guess she would have asked Janice
if she wasn't out of the country.

14:51.093 --> 14:52.287
- Vivian.
- Vivian.

14:52.493 --> 14:55.132
No, you're not gonna leave me alone
with these two...

14:55.293 --> 14:57.443
...after they started
sharpening their claws.

14:57.653 --> 15:00.406
Did someone say Claus?

15:00.613 --> 15:04.401
Because that's just
what this family needs right now.

15:07.773 --> 15:11.209
When you hear this story,
you are gonna laugh.

15:12.213 --> 15:14.932
I accidentally asked both of you
to be the godmother.

15:16.053 --> 15:17.884
- Isn't this funny?
- That's not funny.

15:18.053 --> 15:19.805
- That is ridiculous.
- Nothing's funny...

15:19.973 --> 15:23.409
- How you gonna ask...?
- Ladies! It's Christmas.

15:23.573 --> 15:25.291
Let's not argue.

15:25.493 --> 15:27.723
My Santa suit.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.804
It's been stolen.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.649
It's stolen.

15:36.133 --> 15:39.842
<i>It wasn 't exactly stolen,
more like borrowed.</i>

15:41.493 --> 15:44.053
Merry Christmas.

15:44.413 --> 15:46.005
Hey, Santa.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.568
Mind the booth. Gotta tinkle.

15:50.893 --> 15:52.963
<i>What a lucky break.</i>

15:54.533 --> 15:57.001
I can't believe the schedule
we made for ourselves.

15:57.213 --> 16:00.250
Yeah, man. I never thought
I'd be working on Christmas Eve.

16:00.533 --> 16:01.807
For real, partner.

16:03.293 --> 16:05.602
Merry Christmas.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.767
I recently received a letter
up at the North Pole...

16:08.933 --> 16:11.163
...from a young man
whose only Christmas wish...

16:11.333 --> 16:14.291
...was to have you sing
at his cousin's christening tonight.

16:15.293 --> 16:16.521
Yo, is this for real?

16:17.093 --> 16:18.890
As real as I am.

16:19.093 --> 16:23.325
Now, listen. Please, find it in your hearts
to grant this young man's wish.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.724
Is there gonna be a reception?

16:26.253 --> 16:28.687
So much food, you'll think
a supermarket blew up.

16:29.813 --> 16:31.531
- Beats room service turkey.
- For real.

16:31.773 --> 16:34.731
- Let's go for it, ya'll.
- Yeah. Merry Christmas.

16:34.893 --> 16:39.171
All right. Hey, you guys be at the
First Baptist Church of Bel-Air at 5:00.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.528
Hey, thanks a lot, fellas.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.687
Yo, that's that fool that stole Nicie.

16:49.733 --> 16:52.042
Merry Christmas.

16:53.453 --> 16:57.492
Hats, T-shirts, buttons,
Boyz II Men paraphernalia.

16:57.653 --> 16:58.972
Get your hats, T-shirts...

16:59.133 --> 17:02.205
- Why, Vivian and Philip, welcome.
- Thank you.

17:02.373 --> 17:05.046
Reverend Boyd, these are
my sisters, Helen and Vy.

17:05.252 --> 17:07.005
Good evening. Nice turnout.

17:07.173 --> 17:09.448
One too many if you ask me.

17:16.173 --> 17:19.290
- Hello, are you part of the family?
- Yes.

17:19.453 --> 17:23.810
I'm the part of the family who does
the cleaning, cooking and mending.

17:26.893 --> 17:29.327
I guess Will's coming
with Boyz II Men.

17:29.773 --> 17:33.766
Do you think I should report
my missing Santa suit to the police?

17:34.693 --> 17:36.126
I'm sitting next to Vivian.

17:36.293 --> 17:39.569
I don't want my godson
smelling that cheap perfume.

17:39.733 --> 17:41.371
That's it.

17:41.533 --> 17:43.125
I have had it.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.247
Do you wanna know
who Nicky's godmother's gonna be?

17:47.333 --> 17:49.847
Go on, tell her, Vivian.

17:51.373 --> 17:52.965
Geoffrey.

17:53.133 --> 17:54.612
- Geoffrey!
- Geoffrey!

17:54.773 --> 17:57.207
Somebody spill something?

17:59.813 --> 18:03.931
Geoffrey, nobody loves Nicky
more than you do.

18:04.093 --> 18:07.324
Would you do us the honor
of being Nicky's godfather?

18:07.493 --> 18:09.927
Oh, madam,
I don't know what to say.

18:10.973 --> 18:14.886
This is the best Christmas gift
I could ever get.

18:15.093 --> 18:16.845
Thank you.

18:23.813 --> 18:26.373
Hey, how's everybody doing?

18:26.573 --> 18:29.212
Master William, I'm Nicky's godfather.

18:29.413 --> 18:31.881
- Yeah, congratulations, G.
- Are Boyz II Men here yet?

18:35.533 --> 18:38.366
Can I have everybody's attention,
please?

18:41.213 --> 18:44.489
I wanted to do something special...

18:44.653 --> 18:46.769
...for my cousin Nicky's christening.

18:46.933 --> 18:48.844
You know, everybody
was getting him...

18:49.013 --> 18:51.481
...all these big, expensive gifts
and everything.

18:51.773 --> 18:55.925
So I said that I could deliver
Boyz II Men.

18:57.373 --> 18:58.647
Look, the truth is...

19:32.373 --> 19:33.726
Merry Christmas, Will.

21:38.213 --> 21:41.808
Because it was such a special honor
to have them sing at your christening...

21:41.973 --> 21:45.204
...we took all four of their names,
and we christened you:

21:45.373 --> 21:49.889
Nicholas Michael Shawn
Nathan Wanye Banks.

21:50.493 --> 21:54.964
That's a good story, Daddy.
Can I see my godfather now?

21:55.173 --> 21:57.164
Of course you can. Geoffrey!

21:57.813 --> 22:00.407
- You rang, sir?
- Nicky wanted to see you.

22:00.573 --> 22:02.564
Oh, yes.

22:03.453 --> 22:08.322
- I love you, godfather.
- I love you too, godson.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.724
Now, get me some hot chocolate.

22:12.305 --> 22:18.633
