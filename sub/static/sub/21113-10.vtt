WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.285
All right, darlings, let's catch up

00:03.320 --> 00:05.153
With our delightful trio.
A newly single Sutton

00:05.188 --> 00:06.254
Focused on her career. I'm actually here

00:06.290 --> 00:08.089
To pitch myself as your stylist.

00:08.125 --> 00:09.391
But after a long night at the office,

00:09.426 --> 00:12.260
That focus got a little blurry.

00:12.296 --> 00:14.429
Kat made a grand gesture...

00:14.464 --> 00:17.299
Adena!
And had a grand old time

00:17.334 --> 00:19.301
With Adena at the airport,

00:19.336 --> 00:21.970
But they missed their connection.

00:22.005 --> 00:24.205
And Jane worked on
a big investigative piece...

00:24.241 --> 00:25.440
It's a pro/pro list. Looks like "incite"

00:25.475 --> 00:27.442
Has pulled ahead.

00:27.477 --> 00:30.145
Trying to figure out
if she should take a new job,

00:30.180 --> 00:33.114
But leaving old friends
behind is difficult.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.016
Even for "The Bold Type."

00:41.191 --> 00:43.291
All right, pick it up! Come on.

00:43.327 --> 00:45.327
The endorphins are gonna
get your mind off Adena

00:45.362 --> 00:48.430
And get your mind
off of richard...Or Alex.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.365
Who are we getting our mind off of?

00:50.400 --> 00:52.334
Ha ha! Wait. Why are we

00:52.369 --> 00:54.202
Getting over Alex? Does that mean

00:54.237 --> 00:56.338
You guys finally talked
about all the stuff?

00:56.373 --> 00:58.239
Ha ha! It's been less than a week.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.041
Makes perfect sense that it's still

01:00.077 --> 01:02.010
In the awkward small talk territory.

01:02.045 --> 01:04.212
And I'm not talking about this
over cardio.

01:04.247 --> 01:06.047
All right, great. Brunch then?

01:06.083 --> 01:07.349
Yeah, dawg!

01:12.456 --> 01:14.222
hello? Tiny Jane?

01:14.257 --> 01:16.224
Brunch? Yeah, sure.

01:16.259 --> 01:18.026
Great. After running.

01:18.061 --> 01:19.294
Look, I know you guys don't like to run,

01:19.329 --> 01:21.062
But it really helps me clear my head,

01:21.098 --> 01:23.131
And I'm nervous about this conversation

01:23.166 --> 01:24.999
I have to have with Jacqueline.
Can't believe you're actually

01:25.035 --> 01:26.434
Going through with it.
Well, "incite" wants me

01:26.470 --> 01:29.037
To start in two weeks,
so I'd better give my notice now.

01:29.072 --> 01:30.972
Still not a valid reason to run.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.241
Well, it'll help you
get out of your Adena funk.

01:33.276 --> 01:35.243
So there's a part about that night

01:35.278 --> 01:37.412
That I never told you guys.
Okay, but if it's sex stuff,

01:37.447 --> 01:39.381
It's gonna happen over
pancakes...I'm done with this.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.349
I almost got on the plane with her.

01:41.385 --> 01:43.351
What? Wait...to the middle east?

01:43.387 --> 01:46.187
Really? If I had known you'd stop,

01:46.223 --> 01:48.323
I would have told you
like 20 minutes ago.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.158
Whoa...But seriously?

01:50.193 --> 01:52.093
Yeah. I had the ticket in my hand,

01:52.129 --> 01:55.029
And I was gonna do it.
My God, that's so romantic!

01:55.065 --> 01:56.464
I got swept up in it, you know?

01:56.500 --> 01:58.466
The way that traveling makes her feel

01:58.502 --> 02:00.969
And the way that it makes her think,
I...

02:01.004 --> 02:02.170
I wanted that.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.405
I don't know.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.140
And you can stop
looking at me like that,

02:05.175 --> 02:06.408
Because I didn't do it.

02:06.443 --> 02:08.342
I would have supported you if you did.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.011
Okay...what?

02:10.045 --> 02:11.346
Yeah, what? Yeah!

02:11.381 --> 02:13.248
Look,
I know I don't talk about it a lot,

02:13.283 --> 02:15.250
And I'm not gonna
start talking about it now,

02:15.285 --> 02:17.419
But ever since I got
the results from my brca test,

02:17.454 --> 02:19.154
I just...

02:19.189 --> 02:21.356
You know, life can change in a flash,

02:21.391 --> 02:24.359
So...What are we waiting for, you know?

02:24.394 --> 02:26.428
I mean, like look at this view.

02:26.463 --> 02:29.097
We should be taking in every experience.

02:29.132 --> 02:32.000
We should be living our lives,
taking risks

02:32.035 --> 02:34.269
And, you know,
putting ourselves out there.

02:34.304 --> 02:35.336
Guys?

02:35.372 --> 02:37.038
Are you kidding me?

02:37.073 --> 02:40.141
Run, tiny Jane! Run faster!

02:40.177 --> 02:42.043
You can do it!

02:47.184 --> 02:48.349
Hey, check it out.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.251
1 million, 9 hundred and 90 hundred,

02:50.287 --> 02:53.421
7,000...653 twitter followers!

02:53.457 --> 02:55.390
Are you sure you're
even saying that number right?

02:55.425 --> 02:58.359
Not at all, but...You know
what number is easy to say

02:58.395 --> 03:00.328
Is 2 million. I'm so close.

03:00.363 --> 03:02.363
We really had half this when I started.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.232
This right here is power.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.367
You're ridiculous. You're tiny.

03:06.403 --> 03:09.170
Okay, sent. I still haven't moved past

03:09.206 --> 03:11.339
The "almost got on the plane with Adena"
thing.

03:11.374 --> 03:13.341
Well, you're gonna need to move past it,

03:13.376 --> 03:16.244
Because I have.
I've built up way too much here,

03:16.279 --> 03:18.046
You know?

03:18.081 --> 03:20.014
You make fun of me all you want,
all right?

03:20.050 --> 03:22.016
But this actually means something,
you know?

03:22.052 --> 03:24.152
I have an audience
of almost 2 million people

03:24.187 --> 03:27.021
Like right at my fingertips.
I can do so much with that.

03:27.057 --> 03:29.324
So much more than I could
wandering around some...

03:29.359 --> 03:31.092
Foreign country without even so much

03:31.127 --> 03:32.393
As a change of underwear.

03:32.429 --> 03:35.063
Really? That's gross.

03:35.098 --> 03:37.031
Oh. Hey. Look.

03:38.168 --> 03:39.367
Oh, yeah.

03:39.402 --> 03:41.236
I'm gonna go talk to him right now.

03:41.271 --> 03:44.172
Because I am emotionally mature.
Show off.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.080
Morning. Heyyyy.

03:53.416 --> 03:56.417
After you. Thanks!

03:58.000 --> 04:04.074

04:08.164 --> 04:09.364
So how... Sutton, I...

04:11.167 --> 04:12.367
You go first.

04:12.402 --> 04:15.203
Fashion week's gonna be insane.

04:16.406 --> 04:19.072
Okay. I'll go first.

04:19.108 --> 04:21.108
I am really sick of
this awkward small talk.

04:21.144 --> 04:22.977
Oh, my God, so am I.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.312
I mean, this... I know!

04:24.347 --> 04:26.114
I'm so happy that you said something.

04:28.084 --> 04:29.384
Good morning, Sutton.

04:31.421 --> 04:33.421
Morning, martha. Morning.

04:33.456 --> 04:36.024
So you wanna just... Go out?

04:36.059 --> 04:37.325
Like on a date.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.060
Sutton! Come hither.

04:39.095 --> 04:40.428
Flying in! Is that something

04:40.463 --> 04:43.097
You'd be opposed to? Um...

04:43.133 --> 04:45.099
Sutton!

04:45.135 --> 04:47.335
Go. We'll talk later.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.105
Fashion week.

04:51.141 --> 04:53.241
Busiest of your newly adolescent life.

04:53.276 --> 04:55.176
I own your ass this week.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.444
You own my ass every week.
You're getting

04:56.479 --> 04:58.279
The hang of this. You will be working

04:58.315 --> 05:00.114
Every second of every day this week.

05:00.150 --> 05:02.350
You will get me out of the door
to every show on time.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.352
We wear the designer...
to honor the designer. Got it.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.355
I have all of your outfits steamed,
pressed, and organized.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.058
Good. No mix-ups. Mix-ups happen,

05:10.093 --> 05:11.926
I'm the one who ends up on page 6.

05:11.962 --> 05:13.928
I will not share ink
with anthony weiner.

05:13.964 --> 05:15.964
Not today. Not ever.

05:15.999 --> 05:17.332
also I know

05:17.367 --> 05:19.367
Sometimes you send
assistants to cover shows

05:19.402 --> 05:21.169
When you're too busy.

05:21.204 --> 05:22.403
I would love an opportunity to do that.

05:22.439 --> 05:25.106
I like the confidence.

05:25.141 --> 05:27.408
But I only send my staff
that I know I can trust.

05:27.444 --> 05:29.410
Understood. So if there's
anything I can do this week

05:29.446 --> 05:32.013
To prove that I'm trustworthy...
do you remember the story

05:32.048 --> 05:33.281
Of cinderella? She works her ass off

05:33.316 --> 05:35.049
And gets to go to the ball at the end?

05:35.085 --> 05:36.417
You're the mice.

05:36.453 --> 05:40.088
Or the birds or... I don't remember.

05:40.123 --> 05:41.990
yeah.

05:47.297 --> 05:49.230
Nice work with the fun
and fearless denim piece.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.099
I don't have any notes.

05:51.134 --> 05:53.201
Um, Jacqueline...

05:53.236 --> 05:56.371
I was wondering if I could
schedule a sit-down with you.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.375
I'm...Sitting. What do you need?

06:00.410 --> 06:03.945
Well,
I was hoping we could talk privately.

06:03.980 --> 06:05.279
Okay.

06:05.315 --> 06:07.949
Andrew will reach out.

06:07.984 --> 06:11.252
Kat,
talk to me about the fashion week party.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.154
But let's walk while we talk,

06:13.189 --> 06:15.289
Because I am nowhere close
to my step goal.

06:15.325 --> 06:17.091
Uh...Party's gonna be awesome.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.926
RSVP's are solid.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.928
We got a good blend
of a-listers and influencers

06:20.964 --> 06:22.196
And a bunch of strategies

06:22.265 --> 06:24.132
To get them posting
all over the big four

06:24.167 --> 06:26.067
With twitter being the obvious priority.

06:26.102 --> 06:27.402
Great. Yeah. Everything I'm bringing

06:27.437 --> 06:29.937
To the party is total social media bait.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.172
I actually found these really cool

06:31.241 --> 06:32.974
Green screen photo booths... Hmm.

06:33.009 --> 06:34.942
Sounds fun! Yeah.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.211
I've got a certain number
of posts and shares

06:37.247 --> 06:40.014
That I need to hit in order
to call the party a success.

06:40.050 --> 06:42.216
Have you checked our twitter lately?

06:42.252 --> 06:44.185
Almost to 2 million. Yeah.

06:44.220 --> 06:46.154
Jacqueline, these need to be signed.

06:46.189 --> 06:48.356
Okay. Thank you, andrew. And, uh, now is

06:48.391 --> 06:50.324
The only time you have for Jane.
Let's do it now.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.392
Okay.

06:55.031 --> 06:57.098
Jane. Come on in. Sit down.

06:57.133 --> 07:00.301
I wasn't expecting
to meet with you so quickly.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.170
Um...

07:02.205 --> 07:05.306
This is a very difficult
conversation for me.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.374
I know what this is about.

07:06.409 --> 07:08.910
I figured you might.

07:08.945 --> 07:12.280
Jacqueline...
I noticed you looking her up.

07:12.315 --> 07:14.282
Mia lawrence...she's one of
the first stories

07:14.317 --> 07:16.117
You ever pitched to me.

07:16.152 --> 07:19.087
You want to know why
I wouldn't let you write it.

07:19.122 --> 07:22.056
Well,
I saw her in the park the other day,

07:22.092 --> 07:24.158
And I-I've always thought that she was

07:24.194 --> 07:27.095
An amazing story for us.
But what I wanted to say...

07:27.130 --> 07:29.063
Mia's story is a huge one.

07:29.099 --> 07:31.265
It's emotionally very complex.

07:31.301 --> 07:33.167
I didn't think you had the experience

07:33.203 --> 07:35.002
Or the skill for it

07:35.038 --> 07:36.304
When you first brought it to me.

07:36.339 --> 07:38.172
Oh.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.174
But attention for her
has really dropped off,

07:40.210 --> 07:42.076
So you're not wrong
wanting to revisit it.

07:42.112 --> 07:43.978
Well, actually... but I'll be honest.

07:44.013 --> 07:48.082
I still do have reservations
about giving it to you.

07:48.118 --> 07:50.952
Jane, I've seen you grow a lot
since you first started here,

07:50.987 --> 07:52.954
And I'm not criticizing your work.

07:52.989 --> 07:55.089
It's been tremendous
for a young reporter.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.959
But...It's one thing

07:57.994 --> 08:00.161
To write about yourself.

08:00.196 --> 08:02.163
And it's another thing entirely

08:02.198 --> 08:04.932
To be able to capture
someone else's trauma.

08:04.968 --> 08:07.969
You don't think I could do it?

08:08.004 --> 08:11.038
I feel very confident
that I could handle her story.

08:13.276 --> 08:15.243
But...What I wanted to talk to you...

08:15.278 --> 08:17.979
Hold on.

08:18.014 --> 08:19.180
All right.

08:19.215 --> 08:21.983
Let's give it a shot.

08:22.018 --> 08:25.353
But if...And only if

08:25.388 --> 08:27.321
You are absolutely sure

08:27.357 --> 08:29.323
You're up for it.

08:29.359 --> 08:31.392
I'm absolutely up for it.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.327
Great.

08:33.363 --> 08:36.030
Don't let me down.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.787
Can't believe you wussed
out on telling Jacqueline.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.556
I didn't wuss out.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.624
I wanted this to be my first story,

08:46.660 --> 08:47.926
And now it'll be my last.
It's kind of poetic.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.695
pretty it up however you want.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.531
You still wussed out.
Okay, I wussed out.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.667
But I've wanted to work
at "scarlet" my whole life,

08:55.702 --> 08:56.935
And leaving is hard.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.770
Yeah, I know. We get it, babe.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.638
I still really wanna talk about this,

09:00.674 --> 09:02.640
But I'm about to go back
into the office,

09:02.676 --> 09:04.542
And then I'm gonna be off the grid,
so...

09:04.578 --> 09:05.810
Can we switch to my thing real quick?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.779
Mm. Depends. What's your thing?

09:07.814 --> 09:09.848
Alex wants us to be together.
Yeah, we can switch

09:09.883 --> 09:11.449
To your thing. Wow.

09:11.485 --> 09:12.617
oh, no!

09:12.652 --> 09:14.619
I have to go back to Marc Jacobs!

09:14.654 --> 09:17.722
No, wait, wait, wait!
How do we feel about you and Alex?

09:17.758 --> 09:19.858
We feel... Open to it?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.593
Why did your voice go up at the end?

09:21.628 --> 09:23.495
Because I'm a millennial?

09:23.530 --> 09:24.729
Really?

09:24.765 --> 09:26.664
It's not how I thought it would go,

09:26.700 --> 09:29.667
But he's always there for me,
he makes me laugh,

09:29.703 --> 09:31.636
And he's pretty cute when
you get him out of the khakis.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.471
Oh, really? Do tell. Oh, don't tell.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.507
I sit across from him. No, not for long.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.908
Details. Go on.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.910
I'm really into the idea
of having somebody

09:38.945 --> 09:40.912
That always has my back.
What about richard?

09:40.947 --> 09:43.882
No, no! That's so over, so over.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.484
Everything with richard
was always so complicated.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.686
With Alex, it'd be so easy.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.722
Okay.
I mean, if that's what you really want.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.792
What I really want is to
make fashion week my bitch.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.693
taxi!

10:01.001 --> 10:03.501
Hi. Are you...

10:03.537 --> 10:05.770
Are you here to take a turn?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.739
No. I'm not.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.974
I'm Jane sloan from "scarlett."

10:10.010 --> 10:12.977
I was hoping to interview
you for the magazine.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.779
Is that okay?

10:14.815 --> 10:16.881
sure. I was hoping...

10:16.917 --> 10:18.917
Well, that's the wrong thing to say.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.586
I'm glad you're not a victim.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.822
But I was hoping to take a break.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.723
But, yeah, happy to talk.

10:25.759 --> 10:26.991
Do you mind if I record?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.860
It is an art piece.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.895
The whole point is to get
people to see it.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.797
So go ahead, record. okay.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.734
So when you first started,

10:36.770 --> 10:39.003
There was a lot of attention on you.

10:39.072 --> 10:42.640
Yeah. But that's...
Died down quite a bit.

10:42.676 --> 10:43.942
And is your goal still the same,

10:43.977 --> 10:46.945
To...Never drop the weights?

10:48.949 --> 10:50.815
I still think that there's enough

10:50.851 --> 10:53.751
Women and men like me
who never got justice

10:53.787 --> 10:56.788
That we could go on carrying
the weights forever.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.690
But realistically,

10:58.725 --> 11:00.825
I'll need to put the weights
down at some point.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.661
And when will that be?

11:03.697 --> 11:05.497
Excuse me.

11:05.532 --> 11:08.500
Hi.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.635
Feel a little nervous right now.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.504
I understand.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.742
I'm guessing my pain is your pain.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.928
Sutton!

11:36.963 --> 11:38.630
I already forgot why
I was yelling your name.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.532
Your outfit for proenza schouler.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.600
Yes, that was it.
It's on the rack behind you.

11:42.636 --> 11:43.935
The boots. The ochre combat boots?

11:43.970 --> 11:45.870
They just came in. They're downstairs.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.539
Then why aren't you on your
way to go get them?

11:47.574 --> 11:49.641
Because you just called my name?

11:49.676 --> 11:50.775
That seems valid.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.644
yeah.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.648
Fashion department. Hey, it's me.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.653
You're calling. Aren't you...Here?

12:01.688 --> 12:03.621
I was just calling to say hi.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.957
See, I'm a little new at
this sneaking around thing.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.959
How'm I doing? Not bad.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.495
You probably want an answer
to your question?

12:10.530 --> 12:11.829
That would be nice. Sutton!

12:11.865 --> 12:14.532
Those boots aren't going
to grab themselves.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.634
On my way.
Give me a five-minute head start.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.703
I'm going downstairs.
Meet me in the stairwell

12:18.738 --> 12:20.772
At the back of the building.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.512
It all started with this one image

12:27.547 --> 12:29.581
At the prosecutor's office.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.684
It was a portrait
of lady justice behind him.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.619
It was so hard talking to him,

12:34.654 --> 12:36.788
So I would just stare at her.

12:36.823 --> 12:40.725
Felt like... She had my back.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.962
But after a year,
he said there wasn't enough evidence

12:44.030 --> 12:46.564
And they were dropping the charges.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.635
But...

12:50.670 --> 12:52.704
I still believe in that image.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.873
We met at an art show.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.909
I walked up to him... which is something

12:57.944 --> 12:59.877
The prosecutor was really hung up on,

12:59.913 --> 13:02.513
Because I made the first move.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.715
When I said I needed to go home,

13:03.750 --> 13:05.617
He offered to walk me.

13:05.652 --> 13:06.784
No...

13:08.588 --> 13:11.789
We cut through the park, and he...

13:11.825 --> 13:14.859
He pulled me into the gazebo...

13:16.896 --> 13:19.564
I asked him to stop.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.633
I begged him to stop.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.968
The system failed me, so...

13:24.004 --> 13:25.903
My rapist is an innocent man

13:25.939 --> 13:28.640
And he gets to just go on living.

13:28.675 --> 13:32.577
That's what the prosecutor
said that I should do.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.879
But I don't know how to do that.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.914
People looked at me,
and I looked so normal,

13:36.950 --> 13:38.783
But I don't feel normal.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.718
It's like...

13:40.754 --> 13:43.655
The pain didn't fit my body.

13:45.725 --> 13:49.560
And there's something
about...Standing here,

13:49.596 --> 13:51.663
Owning it.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.765
Does that make sense?

13:55.635 --> 13:56.668
Are these your interview notes?

13:56.703 --> 13:57.835
Yeah.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.771
you need to go deeper.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.473
I want you to schedule
a follow-up interview.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.841
I already did. I wanted to

14:03.877 --> 14:05.643
Gain Mia's trust first.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.513
She's very open,
but there's a part of her

14:08.548 --> 14:10.581
That's still guarded,
for obvious reasons.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.749
Yeah. I would think so.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.685
"how does it impact you

14:13.720 --> 14:15.720
"that people for the most part
have stopped coming out

14:15.755 --> 14:17.588
To see you?" did you ask her that?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.557
Yes.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.626
In the beginning,
there were a lot of crowds,

14:21.661 --> 14:23.795
A lot of people coming
out to support her,

14:23.830 --> 14:26.497
But...Not anymore.
What did she say about that?

14:26.533 --> 14:29.701
She said that as an artist,
she can handle the rejection.

14:29.736 --> 14:32.670
But as a rape survivor...

14:32.706 --> 14:34.939
It's hard to stand there alone.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.844
Okay.
Jane, now, this is not a simple story,

14:39.879 --> 14:41.913
So when you have your
follow-up questions,

14:41.948 --> 14:44.716
I want you to run them by me first.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.624
Are you going somewhere?

15:26.659 --> 15:27.959
Ah, no, you know me.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.762
I prefer the virtual world.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.730
What's up? Nothing.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.899
Jacqueline's just putting
a lot of added pressure

15:34.934 --> 15:37.702
On this article,
and I just wanna do a good job

15:37.737 --> 15:39.971
And go out on a high note.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.873
I don't understand how many times

15:41.908 --> 15:44.709
I have to prove myself to her.
What do you care?

15:44.744 --> 15:46.811
Doesn't what's-her-face
from "incite" like love you?

15:46.846 --> 15:48.946
Shh! Shh!

15:48.982 --> 15:51.616
I care because this poor girl

15:51.651 --> 15:52.950
Just wants to be seen.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.553
I saw somebody
take the weights from her,

15:55.588 --> 15:57.688
And you should have been there.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.524
I don't think there's
anything I could write

15:59.559 --> 16:01.759
That'll be that powerful.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.796
Hey, you're almost at 2 million.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.798
Yep.

16:06.833 --> 16:10.601
1, 997, 400...

16:10.637 --> 16:11.769
Okay.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.641
Wanna use this for good?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.846
We would use a webcam to live stream,

16:21.881 --> 16:25.716
And your art would be broadcast
to our 2 million followers.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.518
Well, almost 2 million.

16:27.554 --> 16:28.820
Not everybody's like me.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.655
What about people
who don't wanna be on camera?

16:30.690 --> 16:32.623
Well,
there's actually a button right here

16:32.659 --> 16:34.559
That people can press,
so if they want to

16:34.594 --> 16:36.561
Hold the weights but
not have their face shown,

16:36.596 --> 16:37.762
They just press this.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.630
The camera will tilt down

16:39.666 --> 16:41.632
And just show their hands.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.837
Look, I know that, uh,

16:45.872 --> 16:48.673
The internet brings out
the worst in people, but...

16:48.708 --> 16:50.508
It also brings out the best.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.844
And you said attention
has died down on you,

16:52.879 --> 16:54.846
So we'd really like to help revive it.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.649
Okay.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.551
Let's try it.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.920
Okay. Okay.

17:02.956 --> 17:04.789
Let me get it set up.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.594
Hey. Hi.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.564
Well, looks like someone's
conquering fashion week.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.567
Yeah, I'm trying...
One pair of boots at a time.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.803
I'm determined to get Oliver to
send me to one of those shows.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.637
He will.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.573
I've watched you conquer bigger divas.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.878
Okay, so...Sure.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.647
Sure?

17:29.682 --> 17:32.516
Yeah, let's...Let's... Try this.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.918
Really.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.753
Yeah.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.855
I'm gonna kiss you now.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.757
I know.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.695
Oh, hello!

17:44.731 --> 17:45.830
Hi. Hi...

17:45.865 --> 17:47.832
I am very, very behind

17:47.867 --> 17:49.600
On my step count,

17:49.636 --> 17:51.502
And I don't see any reason why

17:51.537 --> 17:53.537
"this" should derail that,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.506
So I'm gonna just keep on walking,

17:55.541 --> 17:56.874
And then the three of us

17:56.910 --> 17:58.709
Will have a little meeting upstairs.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.479
Should take about 20 minutes.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.919
I'm gonna go first. Yeah.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.094
Oh! Thanks for getting here so quickly.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.195
Just kidding. Where have you been?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.229
The park. Yeah.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.931
So what happened?

18:20.966 --> 18:22.165
Jacqueline caught you and Alex?

18:22.201 --> 18:23.367
She's making both of us

18:23.402 --> 18:25.068
Meet with hr individually.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.336
I can't believe this.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.038
I was with richard for all that time

18:28.107 --> 18:29.973
And we never got caught once,

18:30.008 --> 18:32.142
And 30 seconds into whatever
this thing with Alex is

18:32.177 --> 18:34.311
Jacqueline busts us?
And I can't even stay here,

18:34.346 --> 18:36.380
Because Oliver thinks
that I'm picking out

18:36.415 --> 18:39.216
Belts for him, so...

18:42.187 --> 18:44.354
Take care of you, babe.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.289
Wow, this just got so interesting.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.225
it escalated quickly.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.960
I know!

19:08.914 --> 19:10.180
Oh. Hey.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.281
Hey. Did you see?

19:11.316 --> 19:13.150
I'm looking right now.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.985
We're getting Mia's story out there.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.153
I'm gonna update Jacqueline.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.154
Okay.

19:34.239 --> 19:37.240
I'm sure you understand,
as a large corporation,

19:37.276 --> 19:39.075
Steinem must investigate

19:39.111 --> 19:41.344
Any and all breaches
in corporate policy.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.247
We're on your side.
We're just here to help.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.983
This meeting is just to
establish some facts.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.985
I'm having someone from legal join us,

19:49.021 --> 19:51.188
Make sure we ask
all the right questions.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.989
I'm not sure if you know each other,

19:53.025 --> 19:54.191
But this is richard hunter.

19:54.226 --> 19:55.358
Good afternoon.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.361
Hello.

20:02.434 --> 20:06.169
Richard,
Alex crawford is senior to Sutton brady,

20:06.205 --> 20:08.138
And that's what we want to
follow up on here.

20:08.173 --> 20:10.006
I understand.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.175
Alex is in a completely
different department,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.044
And we're not... Sutton,

20:14.079 --> 20:16.213
We're going to make this
as painless as possible,

20:16.248 --> 20:19.182
And everything said in this room
is completely confidential.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.017
Right, richard?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.185
Of course.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.191
Can you describe the nature
of your relationship with Alex?

20:31.163 --> 20:33.230
It just started, so...

20:33.265 --> 20:35.265
We're not...it's not...

20:35.300 --> 20:37.033
Defined.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.368
And have you ever received

20:38.403 --> 20:40.136
Any preferential treatment from him

20:40.172 --> 20:41.404
Because of your relationship?

20:41.440 --> 20:43.139
No.

20:45.077 --> 20:49.045
Didn't he just assign you
your first styling credit?

20:53.318 --> 20:54.351
Yes.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.392
Okay, moving on,

21:02.427 --> 21:04.961
Did you ever at any point feel coerced

21:04.997 --> 21:09.032
Or pressured into having
a relationship with him?

21:09.067 --> 21:10.967
We don't have... we do need

21:11.003 --> 21:14.070
A better understanding of what this is.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.308
Was it ever...Intimate in nature?

21:21.013 --> 21:22.245
Um...

21:22.281 --> 21:24.180
I...

21:24.216 --> 21:26.216
Was it ever sexual?

21:28.253 --> 21:30.420
I don't, um...

21:34.259 --> 21:35.225
Yes.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.364
Pardon me.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.966
Okay!

21:43.001 --> 21:46.069
Just a few more questions.

21:46.104 --> 21:49.072
This might be the worst
day of my adult life.

21:49.107 --> 21:52.075
Time check? Uh, you have...

21:52.110 --> 21:55.078
11 minutes until Oliver
gets out of the show.

21:55.113 --> 21:56.446
But...Cheer up, kid,

21:56.481 --> 21:58.448
'cause I got you presents.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.383
Well, Alex is in an hr interview

22:00.419 --> 22:03.920
With richard right now,
so good luck cheering me up.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.189
Ooh, lip stick! Mm-hmm.

22:06.224 --> 22:08.224
So why did we go crazy at macy's?

22:08.260 --> 22:10.160
Uh...Because I'm worth it.

22:10.195 --> 22:13.330
And I know it's a little overboard,
but...

22:13.365 --> 22:15.131
It's my party, so...

22:15.167 --> 22:16.333
And you've worked really hard for this.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.068
Yeah, I have.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.003
And my twitter numbers are up.

22:20.038 --> 22:22.339
I'm using them to actually help someone,
so...

22:22.374 --> 22:24.274
Life's good.

22:24.309 --> 22:25.942
Everythiiing's great!

22:25.978 --> 22:27.410
Babe.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.980
Here.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.015
More presents.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.416
Ooh!

22:35.387 --> 22:38.021
you know what?

22:38.056 --> 22:40.090
It's all gonna work itself out.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.993
Guys...How did this get so messy?

22:44.229 --> 22:46.363
Don't answer that!

22:53.814 --> 22:55.948
Jacqueline. You wanted to see us?

22:55.983 --> 22:58.850
Yes. I wanted to talk
to you about the webcam

22:58.886 --> 23:01.520
And how it specifically
is supporting Mia.

23:01.555 --> 23:02.921
Absolutely. Uh...

23:02.957 --> 23:04.823
It's been amazing.

23:04.858 --> 23:07.492
With Kat's help,
our hashtag is trending,

23:07.528 --> 23:09.895
And the webcam feed is getting
tens of thousands of views.

23:09.930 --> 23:13.498
Yeah. And of those viewers,
31% are leaving comments,

23:13.534 --> 23:14.866
Which puts us in the excellent category.

23:14.902 --> 23:16.935
Well, that does sound very excellent.

23:16.971 --> 23:19.771
And yet,
even with all those great analytics,

23:19.807 --> 23:21.840
We are still left with this...

23:21.875 --> 23:24.676
One girl alone for hours in a park.

23:24.712 --> 23:26.511
Where's all the support
you told me about?

23:26.547 --> 23:27.980
Where's the audience for her art?

23:28.015 --> 23:30.882
Uh, well, they're online.
Did you see the comments?

23:30.918 --> 23:33.552
Kat...No one is showing up.

23:33.587 --> 23:35.621
This is how people show up now.

23:35.656 --> 23:37.756
They...Leave a comment

23:37.791 --> 23:39.858
Or send a hug emogi, you know?

23:39.893 --> 23:42.761
Yeah. Well... And then twitter moves on

23:42.796 --> 23:44.796
To the next big thing.
I mean, we're doing everything

23:44.832 --> 23:47.699
We can think of.
Then we need to do better.

23:47.735 --> 23:48.967
I know somebody over
at the rape crisis center.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.802
We need to talk to her.

23:50.838 --> 23:52.804
We need to reach out
to other activist groups.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.540
I mean, this article has the potential

23:55.576 --> 23:57.843
To be very powerful,
and I am going to do

23:57.878 --> 24:00.612
Everything I can
to make sure that it is.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.848
Okay, well,
I'm almost finished with the piece.

24:02.883 --> 24:04.916
I could show it to you tomorrow.

24:04.952 --> 24:06.718
Jane, don't rush this. Take your time.

24:06.754 --> 24:08.687
This is very important.

24:08.722 --> 24:10.689
Yeah.

24:10.724 --> 24:12.791
Okay, you guys need to go get ready.

24:19.767 --> 24:21.967
You need to tell Jacqueline
you're leaving

24:22.002 --> 24:24.536
Before tomorrow. I know.

24:24.571 --> 24:25.971
It's under control.

24:27.775 --> 24:29.641
Door mouse... What do you need?

24:29.677 --> 24:31.710
For you to get out.
If you're late to the party,

24:31.745 --> 24:33.712
I'm the one who looks like a mean boss.

24:33.747 --> 24:35.547
I'm almost done. With my show notes?

24:35.582 --> 24:36.848
You should have had those
transcribed hours ago.

24:36.884 --> 24:38.684
I did. Check your email.

24:38.719 --> 24:40.752
But I could never
afford most of those brands.

24:40.788 --> 24:42.621
Which is why you're always
borrowing from the closet.

24:42.656 --> 24:44.556
right.

24:44.591 --> 24:46.625
But most of our readers
don't have the same access,

24:46.660 --> 24:48.527
So based on what you like
from the shows,

24:48.562 --> 24:49.995
I'm putting together a list of similar

24:50.030 --> 24:52.898
But more affordable items from
retailers in our price range.

24:52.933 --> 24:54.933
I'll email it to you.

25:17.591 --> 25:18.890
Hey. Hi.

25:18.926 --> 25:20.926
This is amazing! Thank you.

25:20.961 --> 25:22.894
Great job. Thanks.

25:22.930 --> 25:24.663
Bar? Yes.

25:24.698 --> 25:26.531
Bar. Great.

25:31.605 --> 25:34.706
Let's... Yeah.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.509
Uh...Dessert! Great!

25:37.544 --> 25:38.844
Oh. Oh...

25:38.879 --> 25:40.846
Nope. Um...

25:40.881 --> 25:42.748
Let's take another lap.

25:50.657 --> 25:52.591
What? I'm not ready.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.862
You know what? I've got work to do,

25:56.897 --> 25:59.531
So you two go deal with your issues.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.801
Hi.

26:35.836 --> 26:38.804
I feel really bad.

26:38.839 --> 26:42.707
I never meant to put you
in such a terrible position.

26:42.743 --> 26:45.944
Yeah, it wasn't my best hr meeting.

26:45.979 --> 26:49.548
Alex held up like a champ.
He's a good guy.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.550
He is.

26:52.886 --> 26:56.688
I really regret how everything happened.

26:56.723 --> 26:59.925
For what it's worth,
I have a lot of regrets too.

27:01.962 --> 27:04.529
I really don't want that to be true.

27:04.565 --> 27:07.499
I don't mean that I regret
us being together.

27:07.534 --> 27:08.934
I mean...

27:08.969 --> 27:11.503
Sutton, I got so wrapped up in work

27:11.538 --> 27:12.904
And what might happen if we got caught.

27:12.940 --> 27:14.673
I know.

27:14.708 --> 27:17.776
I regret not trying harder.

27:17.811 --> 27:19.511
I don't think there's anything

27:19.546 --> 27:20.812
Either of us could have
done differently.

27:20.848 --> 27:23.548
I don't think I can agree with that.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.652
I should have fought for you.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.889
I should have really fought for you.

27:30.924 --> 27:32.724
You look great.

28:13.867 --> 28:16.768
Don't you think her music's amazing?
I know!

28:16.803 --> 28:18.637
Jacqueline.

28:18.672 --> 28:20.505
I have to have a word with you.

28:20.541 --> 28:21.907
Oh, okay. Nice to see you guys.

28:21.942 --> 28:24.476
Thank you for coming.
Okay, see you later.

28:24.511 --> 28:25.610
Keep up the good work.

28:25.646 --> 28:27.779
Can I get another one, please?

28:27.814 --> 28:29.614
You bet. Thank you.

28:29.650 --> 28:32.651
Ah. It's a great party, huh?

28:32.686 --> 28:34.519
Jane, is everything okay?

28:35.622 --> 28:37.956
I've been trying to talk to you all day,

28:37.991 --> 28:41.526
And I know this isn't the right time,
but...

28:41.562 --> 28:43.528
I was offered a job at "incite",

28:43.564 --> 28:45.897
And I've decided to take it.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.500
Really?

28:48.535 --> 28:50.502
Mia's story will be my last.

28:50.537 --> 28:52.704
I'll be leaving after that.

28:52.739 --> 28:54.573
I wish I could have delivered

28:54.608 --> 28:56.741
The way you wanted me to, so...

28:56.777 --> 28:58.510
I'm sorry I let you down.

28:58.545 --> 29:01.513
Jane, you didn't let me down.

29:01.548 --> 29:03.915
Well, I feel like I did.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.518
Anyways...

29:06.553 --> 29:08.587
Thank you so much

29:08.622 --> 29:10.689
For everything you've taught me.

29:10.724 --> 29:13.858
It's been an incredible experience,
and...

29:13.894 --> 29:16.728
I'll never forget working for you.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.364
Um...

29:27.400 --> 29:30.267
I did it.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.136
I quit.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.271
Oh!

29:34.306 --> 29:36.240
Are you okay? Yeah.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.377
I think I might just...

29:40.413 --> 29:42.312
Take a walk or something.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.082
You want us to come with you? No. Um...

29:45.117 --> 29:47.317
I should probably be alone.

29:47.353 --> 29:50.154
But I'll see you at home. Okay.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.956
Love you.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.967
Jane. Hi.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.936
Hi.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.075
Do you have more questions?

30:11.110 --> 30:13.410
No. Um...

30:13.446 --> 30:17.381
I know I can't
carry your weights for you,

30:17.416 --> 30:19.316
But...I was thinking

30:19.351 --> 30:22.352
Maybe I could stand with you
for a little while.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.254
That would be great.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.365
Hey, Alex.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.968
Wanna take a picture with me?

30:38.003 --> 30:40.270
Uh, yeah. Excuse me.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.241
Uh, after you. Thank you.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.353
Alex, I need to be honest with you.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.422
I know what you're gonna say.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.192
That's gonna be a great
one for the scrapbook.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.197
I never meant to lead you on.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.099
I really did wanna try.

31:09.135 --> 31:11.201
I just... I don't wanna be that guy.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.936
What guy?

31:12.972 --> 31:14.304
The guy you were with

31:14.340 --> 31:16.940
When you're really in love
with the other guy.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.410
I think you're amazing.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.214
I know.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.417
I'll see you around, Sutton.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.391
Come on!

31:59.351 --> 32:01.251
Hey.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.986
You okay?

32:03.022 --> 32:04.288
Yeah, I'm good.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.223
But, hey, I gotta tell you.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.959
Your photo booth seemed
like so much fun...

32:09.028 --> 32:11.395
Until I was breaking up
in three international places.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.330
And mars. Oh...

32:13.399 --> 32:15.132
Which was a nice touch, by the way.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.201
Thank you. Thank you.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.969
Hey, Kat, did you see?

32:19.004 --> 32:20.938
You hit 2 million!

32:20.973 --> 32:22.973
Congrats! Oh...

32:23.008 --> 32:24.308
"oh"? That's it?

32:24.343 --> 32:26.310
Kat, you've been obsessing
about hitting this number.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.345
Yeah. Just...

32:28.380 --> 32:30.414
Just doesn't feel
how I thought it would.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.416
How does it feel?

32:32.451 --> 32:35.986
Uh...Empty?

32:38.090 --> 32:39.289
Should we get outta here?

32:39.325 --> 32:41.058
Yeah. Yeah.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.326
Let's find my friend Jane.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.228
Yeah. I got it.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.263
Oh. Oh!

32:51.136 --> 32:53.437
Well, I'm glad you're here.

32:53.472 --> 32:57.007
These nights get long.

32:57.042 --> 32:58.308
Hey, Mia.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.110
Hi, Kat!

33:00.145 --> 33:02.145
What are you guys doing here?

33:02.181 --> 33:04.214
Showing up.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.216
Thank you.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.233
You guys make me feel like
I'm a little underdressed.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.869
We worked at a news magazine together,

34:57.904 --> 34:59.804
And he was senior to me,

34:59.839 --> 35:03.441
So all my stories had to run past him.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.610
And this was... Over 20 years ago

35:05.645 --> 35:07.812
And my first year as a journalist.

35:07.847 --> 35:12.450
And the environment
was tough for anyone,

35:12.485 --> 35:14.552
But especially if you were a woman.

35:14.587 --> 35:18.456
And his professional respect
meant something to me.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.491
I worked hard for it.

35:20.526 --> 35:22.660
What happened?

35:23.930 --> 35:25.696
Oh...

35:27.600 --> 35:30.701
One night he... Asked me to stay late.

35:30.737 --> 35:33.471
He said that he wanted to help me

35:33.506 --> 35:35.573
With my story, that it had potential

35:35.608 --> 35:38.542
But that it needed work and...

35:38.578 --> 35:40.478
I accepted.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.446
Gratefully.

35:42.482 --> 35:45.483
That was not... An invitation,

35:45.518 --> 35:47.919
But...He took it that way.

35:49.889 --> 35:52.823
We were the only ones...

35:52.859 --> 35:54.659
In the office that night,

35:54.694 --> 35:56.594
And...

36:01.701 --> 36:03.834
I have never felt so...

36:03.870 --> 36:05.836
Powerless.

36:09.709 --> 36:13.411
Did you ever consider pressing charges?

36:13.446 --> 36:15.646
Not even for a second.

36:15.682 --> 36:18.449
That would have ended my career,

36:18.484 --> 36:21.585
Or at the very least defined it.

36:21.621 --> 36:23.554
So...I made a choice.

36:23.589 --> 36:26.691
I decided to push it down,
go back to work,

36:26.726 --> 36:28.793
And just...

36:28.828 --> 36:32.563
Pretend like nothing had ever happened.

36:32.598 --> 36:33.864
Have you told anyone?

36:33.900 --> 36:35.900
Ian.

36:35.935 --> 36:37.835
We started dating not long after,

36:37.870 --> 36:41.672
And he needed to understand
why I had some trust issues.

36:46.479 --> 36:48.579
I just have one last question.

36:50.550 --> 36:52.483
Why come forward now?

36:54.854 --> 36:57.755
Well, Mia asked...

36:57.790 --> 37:00.791
If she would ever feel normal again.

37:00.827 --> 37:05.863
And I can only speak from
my own experience, but...

37:05.898 --> 37:08.432
I would say the answer is no.

37:10.703 --> 37:12.737
But you find a new normal.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.872
And it works so well that sometimes

37:14.907 --> 37:16.807
You don't even know that it's not.

37:16.843 --> 37:19.477
And...

37:23.816 --> 37:26.550
I don't think I realized
how much of the weight

37:26.586 --> 37:29.520
I was still carrying.

37:37.897 --> 37:41.465
Me pushing you on this
story was misdirected.

37:41.501 --> 37:44.702
It was not about you. It was about me.

37:44.737 --> 37:46.737
And I'm sorry for that.

37:48.674 --> 37:50.841
I'm not.

37:52.578 --> 37:54.512
You made me a better writer.

37:54.547 --> 37:56.547
Well, I'll take that credit.

37:58.451 --> 37:59.817
And I hope where you're going

37:59.852 --> 38:02.553
There's someone who's
gonna keep on pushing you

38:02.588 --> 38:04.622
Because, Jane, I really do believe

38:04.657 --> 38:07.691
That you have the potential
to be exceptional.

38:10.563 --> 38:12.863
Hey, Oliver, I have your outfit

38:12.899 --> 38:14.632
For the Marc Jacobs show.

38:16.569 --> 38:19.503
Oh, my God. I don't know what happened.

38:19.539 --> 38:22.706
Hmm...Elegant. Sophisticated.

38:22.742 --> 38:25.709
But not exactly my style. Or size.

38:25.745 --> 38:28.479
I'll fix it right away.
No, it's too late.

38:28.514 --> 38:30.548
You'll never get me
a new outfit in time.

38:30.583 --> 38:31.882
Although...

38:31.918 --> 38:34.819
This one seems to be about...Your size.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.721
And black is an excellent color for you.

38:37.757 --> 38:40.658
Guess you'll just have to
take my place at the show.

38:40.693 --> 38:43.527
Oh, my God. Really? Red.

38:43.563 --> 38:44.728
Keep bringing your passion.

38:44.764 --> 38:46.564
It's how you're gonna make your mark.

38:46.599 --> 38:47.832
Thank you.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.734
Take good notes. Absolutely!

38:57.877 --> 39:00.444
This just got so real.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.713
Too real.

39:02.748 --> 39:05.483
okay, make your toast.

39:06.619 --> 39:08.385
Hang on. I need a second.

39:08.421 --> 39:10.621
I have to think. It needs to be perfect.

39:10.656 --> 39:13.524
Of course it does.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.793
Yeah, dawg.

39:15.828 --> 39:18.729
Okay.

39:18.764 --> 39:21.432
To having adventures.

39:21.467 --> 39:23.534
Ha ha ha!

39:23.569 --> 39:25.569
To making mistakes.

39:25.605 --> 39:27.838
To sleeping with the wrong people.

39:27.874 --> 39:30.674
And the right people.
