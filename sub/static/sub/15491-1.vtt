WEBVTT

00:26.294 --> 00:32.200
Chorus:
* SHOULD OLD ACQUAINTANCE
BE FORGOT *

00:32.232 --> 00:37.538
* AND NEVER BROUGHT TO MIND

00:37.571 --> 00:42.810
* SHOULD OLD ACQUAINTANCE
BE FORGOT *

00:42.843 --> 00:48.482
* IN DAYS OF AULD LANG SYNE

00:48.516 --> 00:53.487
* FOR AULD LANG SYNE,
MY DEAR *

00:53.521 --> 00:58.326
* FOR AULD LANG SYNE

00:58.359 --> 01:02.563
* WE'LL TAKE
A CUP OF KINDNESS YET *

01:02.596 --> 01:07.435
* FOR AULD LANG SYNE.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.947
MR. FOREMAN, HAVE YOU
ARRIVED AT A VERDICT?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.249
WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.583
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT

02:29.617 --> 02:31.885
GUILTY OF ALL CHARGES.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.531
HE HAS NO PRIORS,
YOUR HONOR...

02:43.564 --> 02:45.199
THAT'S MISLEADING,
YOUR HONOR.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.567
HE HAS NO CONVICTIONS.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.868
Judge:
IS HE DANGEROUS?

02:47.901 --> 02:49.903
NO. HE'S A SLIPPERY
LITTLE SHIT.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.572
REQUEST BAIL BE CONTINUED.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.607
BAIL FOR THIS SLEAZEBAG?

02:53.641 --> 02:55.643
HE'S ALREADY WASTED
THE JURY'S TIME.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.779
JUDGE, KNOCK HIM IN NOW.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.915
YOUR HONOR, HE'S A VERY DECENT
FAMILY MAN.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.584
HE HAS NO PRIORS.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.354
Judge:
FORGET ABOUT THE PRIORS.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.688
WAS HE VIOLENT
OR SOMETHING?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.857
HE WOULDN'T HURT
A FLEA.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.392
I MEAN, A FLY.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.726
BUT I'M ASKING BAIL.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.328
I'M NOT NAIVE.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.963
Judge:
THAT'S ENOUGH.

03:15.996 --> 03:19.867
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.869
I GOT YOUR BAIL CONTINUED.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.837
I DON'T WANT
MY BAIL CONTINUED.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.906
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
MR. LaPLANTE

03:25.939 --> 03:27.575
THAT THEY FOUND YOU GUILTY.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.709
GUILTY?

03:28.742 --> 03:30.278
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:30.311 --> 03:31.912
THE JURY FOUND YOU GUILTY.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.447
I'M INNOCENT,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.583
MR. LaPLANTE,
I HAVE BEEN PERSUADED

03:35.616 --> 03:38.852
IN VIEW OF YOUR CONTINUED
EMPLOYMENT AND YOUR LACK

03:38.886 --> 03:41.989
OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS,
TO CONTINUE YOUR BAIL

03:42.022 --> 03:44.658
UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS
HERETOFORE

03:44.692 --> 03:46.827
PENDING SENTENCING
SIX DAYS FROM NOW.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.962
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU'LL MAKE AN APPOINTMENT

03:48.996 --> 03:50.664
WITH A PROBATION OFFICER

03:50.698 --> 03:52.833
WHO WILL MAKE
A RECOMMENDATION TO ME

03:52.866 --> 03:54.502
REGARDING YOUR SENTENCE.

03:54.535 --> 03:58.906
I URGE YOU
TO USE THOSE SIX DAYS

03:58.939 --> 04:01.875
TO GET YOUR PERSONAL AFFAIRS
IN ORDER

04:01.909 --> 04:04.712
IN ANTICIPATION
OF INCARCERATION.

04:07.815 --> 04:11.852
IN ANTICIPATION
OF INCARCERATION.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.687
ANTICIPATION
OF INCARCERATION.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.022
HE MEANS PRISON.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.923
I KNOW WHAT HE MEANS.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.927
I'M NOT A PRISONER
KIND OF GUY, MISS O'DAY.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.463
LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT DOING
YOUR JOB HERE.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.898
LAST TIME, MY LAWYER GOT
THE CHARGES DISMISSED.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.767
THAT'S WHY
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

04:26.800 --> 04:28.569
IS BEING SO HARD-NOSED
THIS TIME.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.937
WHAT ABOUT AN APPEAL?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.605
WE DON'T HAVE GROUNDS.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.442
WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON
THE PROBATION OFFICER'S
REPORTS.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.944
HE GIVES A GOOD REPORT
AND I WALK?

04:36.977 --> 04:39.079
A SUSPENDED SENTENCE
IS UNLIKELY NOW.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.048
YOU STILL HAVE
YOUR JOB, RIGHT?

04:41.081 --> 04:43.050
YEAH. I'VE BEEN
CALLING IN SICK.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.918
THEY THINK I GOT THE FLU.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.955
AND A SON BY YOUR
EX-WIFE? JOSEPH?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.056
A SON? YEAH.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.824
WHAT ABOUT HIM? JOEY.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.793
ARE YOU INVOLVED
IN HIS UPBRINGING?

04:52.826 --> 04:55.496
CHRIST, SHE ATTACHED
MY PAYCHECK, CHILD SUPPORT.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.931
THAT'S WHY I GOT
A COURT-APPOINTED LAWYER

04:57.965 --> 05:00.468
INSTEAD OF A... YOU KNOW,
MORE EXPERIENCED ONE.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.603
HOW OFTEN
DO YOU SEE YOUR SON?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.771
I DON'T KNOW.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.072
ON HIS BIRTHDAY.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.607
MAY, I THINK.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.976
SHE DON'T LIKE ME
TO SEE HIM.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.944
SHE THINKS
I'M A BAD INFLUENCE.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.513
YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR SON

05:12.546 --> 05:14.382
AND GET A NOTE
FROM YOUR BOSS

05:14.415 --> 05:16.417
ABOUT YOUR JOB PERFORMANCE.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.719
YOU NEED TO CREATE
THE IMPRESSION

05:18.752 --> 05:21.855
OF A DECENT CITIZEN
WITH FAMILIAL RESPONSIBILITIES

05:21.889 --> 05:25.493
WHO HAPPENED
TO SLIP UP ONCE.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.796
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HAVING
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES

05:28.829 --> 05:31.098
BUT I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT THE MONEY

05:31.131 --> 05:33.967
THAT I LOANED YOU
LAST WEEK?

05:37.905 --> 05:41.775
SOME OF IT.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.912
I'LL GET YOU THE REST
AS SOON AS I CAN.

05:44.945 --> 05:48.682
IF YOU'RE A LITTLE SHORT,
I MEAN, IT'S OKAY.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.884
WELL, I BETTER KEEP
SOME OF IT

05:50.918 --> 05:53.020
IF I'M GOING
TO SEE THE KID

05:53.053 --> 05:54.422
FOR GAS AND STUFF.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.893
( snarling )

05:59.927 --> 06:01.429
LOOK AT THAT ONE.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.797
IF YOU WERE IN THERE,
HE'D KILL YOU.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.733
WOULDN'T HE, DAD?

06:08.702 --> 06:12.139
YEAH, YEAH,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.578
YOU KNOW, THIS GUY
THAT YOUR MOTHER IS SEEING--

06:17.611 --> 06:19.747
WHAT IS HE, A FIREMAN?

06:19.780 --> 06:22.983
DID HE EVER, UH, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, JUST SPEND THE NIGHT?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.518
SOMETIMES.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.886
HIS NAME IS ELLIOTT.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.822
SAVED A GUY'S LIFE
ONE TIME IN A FIRE.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.525
OH, A HERO.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.662
WAS HE EVER IN THE 'NAM,
THIS GUY ELLIOTT?

06:34.695 --> 06:35.796
THE 'NAM?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.064
YEAH.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.165
WHAT'S THAT?

06:38.198 --> 06:39.667
IT WAS THIS WAR,
VIETNAM.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.535
DOESN'T MATTER.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.537
WERE YOU IN IT?
IN THE WAR?

06:43.571 --> 06:44.938
YOU DIDN'T SEE
THAT PICTURE?

06:44.972 --> 06:46.139
WHAT PICTURE?

06:46.173 --> 06:48.509
ME IN MY UNIFORM.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.143
USED TO BE OVER
THE FIREPLACE.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.845
HMM.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.515
SEE WHAT I DON'T LIKE
ABOUT PUBLIC REST ROOMS

06:54.548 --> 06:56.149
IS YOU'RE ALWAYS
STANDING IN PISS.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.018
YOU GOT THEM SNEAKERS ON

06:58.051 --> 07:01.021
BUT I'M STANDING IN PISS
IN VERY EXPENSIVE SHOES.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.056
I DON'T WANT PISS
ON THEM.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.559
IT'S A BREAKDOWN
IN CUSTODIAL SERVICES.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.160
LOOK, SOMEBODY LOST
THEIR WALLET.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.662
WHAT?

07:17.638 --> 07:18.906
WHERE YOU GOING?

07:18.939 --> 07:21.108
TO GIVE IT
TO THE MANAGER.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.211
YOU GIVE IT TO THE MANAGER,
HE POCKETS THE DOUGH.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.046
WE'LL GO OUT BACK.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.682
MOST PEOPLE IN SUPERVISORY
POSITIONS ARE CROOKS.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.050
WHAT ABOUT THE CHECK?

07:30.083 --> 07:32.019
I'VE GOT AN ACCOUNT HERE.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.588
TOMORROW WHEN I GET
TO THE OFFICE

07:34.622 --> 07:37.024
I'LL HAVE MY SECRETARY
PHONE THIS GUY UP.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.693
LET THE GUY COME
AND GET HIS WALLET.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.695
MAKE SURE YOU GET A REWARD.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.063
YOU DESERVE A REWARD.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.698
YOU WANT ONE, DON'T YOU?

07:44.732 --> 07:46.199
CAN YOU SPARE
SOME CHANGE?

07:46.233 --> 07:48.068
GO AWAY, FELLOW.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.738
RESIST THE URGE
TO BE NICE TO THOSE PEOPLE.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.740
THEY'RE CON ARTISTS.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.242
A LOT OF THEM
ARE FINANCIALLY BETTER OFF

07:55.275 --> 07:57.044
THAN THE REST OF US.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.212
YOU GOT TO LOOK OUT
FOR NUMBER ONE.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.714
IT'S A GODDAMN--

08:00.748 --> 08:03.050
EXCUSE THE VULGARITY--
JUNGLE OUT THERE.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.618
YOU GOT TO KEEP
A LOW PROFILE.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.921
RIGHT? A LOW PROFILE.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.194
( rattling )

08:19.900 --> 08:21.835
HEY, BERNIE,
WHERE YOU BEEN, PAL?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.904
SOME GUYS BEEN
LOOKING FOR ME, CHICK?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.906
SPANISH KIND OF GUYS?

08:25.939 --> 08:27.040
SPANISH KIND OF GUYS?

08:27.074 --> 08:28.776
BUSINESS TYPES.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.645
GIVE ME A SEVEN AND SEVEN,
WILL YOU?

08:32.880 --> 08:36.183
WHAT IS IT,
FIVE DAYS NOW I DON'T SEE YOU?

08:36.216 --> 08:39.720
'CAUSE I'M UP TO MY ASS
IN SHIT IS WHY.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.321
BROKE 'CAUSE
I GOT LEGAL PROBLEMS.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.624
NOBODY WAS ASKING
FOR ME, HUH?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.326
NOPE.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.328
LEGAL PROBLEMS?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.731
YOU GOT TO HAVE
A GOOD ATTORNEY.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.200
MY ATTORNEY, SHE'S JUST
OUT OF LAW SCHOOL.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.570
COUPLE OF YEARS OLDER
THAN MY KID,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.138
YOU GOT A KID, BERNIE?

08:58.171 --> 08:59.807
HOW OLD IS YOUR KID?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.141
NINE, I THINK.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.275
MAYBE TEN.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.777
YEAH, TEN.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.045
NICE KID.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.615
YOU GOT A TEN-YEAR-OLD
ATTORNEY, BERNIE?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.851
I CAN'T AFFORD NO BETTER.

09:10.884 --> 09:15.823
MY EX,
SHE ATTACHED MY PAYCHECK
FOR CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS.

09:15.856 --> 09:19.359
YOU LOOKING FOR
BERNIE LaPLANTE BY ANY CHANCE?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.029
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU HAD A KID.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.265
THE THING IS, KIDS THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO GROW UP

09:25.298 --> 09:28.301
TO BE A WONDERFUL PERSON
INSTEAD OF AN ASSHOLE

09:28.335 --> 09:30.003
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.339
WE'RE ALL ASSHOLES, BERNIE?

09:32.372 --> 09:36.343
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE

09:36.376 --> 09:38.646
THIS FANTASTIC, WONDERFUL,
HEROIC HUMAN BEING.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.381
ARE YOU BERNIE LaPLANTA?

09:41.414 --> 09:44.852
LaPLANTE--
BERNIE LaPLANTE.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.620
YOU THE GUYS
THAT BUNNY CALLED?

09:46.654 --> 09:48.188
MM-HMM.
YEAH.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.758
ESTAS NO SIRVEN.

09:52.993 --> 09:56.664
NO TRAE NADA.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.131
THREE HOURS
IS OLD, MAN.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.134
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE
REPORTED THEM YET.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.171
HE MIGHT NOT KNOW
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.674
WHAT DID YOU DO,
PICK HIS POCKET?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.141
YEAH, MORE OR LESS.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.378
TRUST ME,
THESE ARE VERY, VERY FRESH.

10:11.411 --> 10:15.115
TO BE HONEST,
IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE

10:15.148 --> 10:16.750
TO ME EITHER, MISS GAYLEY.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.286
THINGS SEEM TO BE
ON THE UPSWING.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.656
OUR DIFFICULTIES WITH THE FCC
HAVE BEEN FAVORABLY RESOLVED.

10:22.690 --> 10:26.026
IN A BUSINESS SENSE,
I THINK WE'VE TURNED
THE CORNER.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.029
YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN
ARE ON THEIR WAY.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.864
THANK YOU
FOR COMING OUT HERE

10:30.898 --> 10:32.766
AND LETTING ME TALK TO YOU.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.202
OH, MY GOD!

10:35.235 --> 10:36.870
CHUCKY, TILT DOWN!

10:38.238 --> 10:39.840
( thudding )

10:39.873 --> 10:42.309
DID YOU GET IT?

10:42.342 --> 10:43.944
JESUS, DID I SAY THAT?

10:43.977 --> 10:47.948
YEAH, I GOT IT.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.751
SPORTS TRAINING--
LEARN TO FOLLOW THE BALL.

10:50.784 --> 10:55.222
HEY, LISTEN, HOW ABOUT YOU DO
YOU WRAP-UP FROM UP HERE?

10:55.255 --> 10:58.058
I'LL PULL BACK
FROM THAT SKYSCRAPER THERE

10:58.091 --> 11:00.894
FIND YOU HERE,
THEN REVEAL THE DROP.

11:00.928 --> 11:04.732
SUICIDE #137 OF THIS YEAR
IN THIS CITY

11:04.765 --> 11:08.035
WAS NEITHER A DESTITUTE
NOR A LONELY MAN

11:08.068 --> 11:11.004
BUT A SUCCESSFUL EXECUTIVE
WITH A LOVING FAMILY

11:11.038 --> 11:13.306
AND $40 MILLION
IN THE BANK.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.309
If there's nameless despair
in executive offices

11:16.343 --> 11:18.779
what can there be
60 stories below

11:18.812 --> 11:20.480
where the hungry
and the homeless

11:20.513 --> 11:22.249
the brutalized
and the addicted

11:22.282 --> 11:24.785
fight their daily battle
for survival.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.154
From a ledge 60 stories
above the street

11:27.187 --> 11:29.823
I'm Gale Gayley
for Channel 4 news.

11:29.857 --> 11:33.727
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE FALL SHOT, CHIEF?

11:33.761 --> 11:36.363
THE GUY DROPS 20 STORIES
IN PERFECT FOCUS

11:36.396 --> 11:39.499
CENTER FRAME WHILE I SMOOTHLY
GO FROM F16 TO F5.6.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.168
HELL OF A SHOT, CHUCKY.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.736
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.337
PARKER, RUN THIS
DOWN TO FRAZIER.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.373
TELL HIM
WE'LL OPEN WITH IT.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.841
BET SHE PUSHED HIM

11:47.875 --> 11:49.342
JUST FOR
THE GREAT SHOT.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.878
PUSHED HIM?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.179
HE'S KIDDING,
MR. WALLACE.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.513
CONKLIN'S JEALOUS

11:53.546 --> 11:55.015
BECAUSE IT WASN'T
HIS STORY.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.884
ACTUALLY,
IT TORE HER UP

11:56.917 --> 11:58.886
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T
SAVE THE GUY.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.520
SHE WANTED
TO REACH OUT.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.355
HI, CHIEF.
LIKE THE SUICIDE?

12:02.389 --> 12:03.857
NEVER REACH OUT.

12:03.891 --> 12:04.925
HE'S RIGHT.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.193
IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.861
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.897
SAVING PEOPLE
IS NOT OUR JOB.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.231
IT'S JUST AS WRONG

12:11.264 --> 12:13.233
TO STEP IN
AND SAVE SOMEONE

12:13.266 --> 12:16.069
AS IT WOULD BE
TO PUSH HIM OFF.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.406
I DIDN'T SAY I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD HAVE SAVED HIM.

12:19.439 --> 12:23.877
I SAID I WISH IT HAD OCCURRED
TO ME TO CONSIDER SAVING HIM.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.279
IT'S NOT A BAD STORY--
NEWSWOMAN SAVES SUICIDE.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.048
IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.983
YOU JUST CAN'T BEAR
GOOD NEWS.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.919
YOU'RE SITTING
ON YOUR TICKET.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.253
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.088
SHE'S FLYING
TO NEW YORK.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.557
SHE'S BEEN NOMINATED
FOR A SILVER MIC AWARD.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.793
YOU ARE COVERING US
IN GLORY.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.294
I HAVEN'T WON YET.

12:41.328 --> 12:44.331
I NOTICED YOU HAD ME
SCHEDULED ON A FLIGHT BACK

12:44.364 --> 12:46.199
AN HOUR
AFTER THE CEREMONY.

12:46.233 --> 12:50.403
DEAK, LET'S AT LEAST GIVE HER
A NIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.305
WE'LL PUT HER
AND HER BOYFRIEND UP...

12:52.339 --> 12:54.307
SHE BROKE UP
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.575
WE NEED YOU BACK

12:55.608 --> 12:57.878
TO FOLLOW UP
ON THE JUMPER.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.347
FIND THE HUMAN INTEREST
IN THE UNENDING WOE

13:00.380 --> 13:02.015
POURING FROM
THE HEARTLESS METROPOLIS.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.283
THE DIRT, YOU MEAN.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.852
THAT TOO.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.419
A REALLY GOOD HOTEL?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.288
ABSOLUTELY.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.123
SO LONG, BABE.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.092
OKAY,
THE HELL WITH IT.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.895
PARTY ON, GALE.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.296
IS THAT WHAT THEY SAY?

13:16.329 --> 13:18.065
I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.167
SHE'S PRETENDING
TO BE A PERSON.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.402
SHE'S REALLY JUST A REPORTER.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.939
50 BUCKS SAYS SHE'LL BE BACK
ON THE FIRST FLIGHT.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.923
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEAN
BY A TECHNICALITY.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.025
YOU WERE FOUND GUILTY
BY A JURY.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.927
BUT THE COPS DIDN'T FOLLOW

13:46.960 --> 13:49.362
THE CORRECT PROCEDURE
WITH THE EVIDENCE.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.464
YOU KNOW,
THE CHAIN OF EVIDENCE?

13:51.498 --> 13:54.868
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ESTABLISHED BY YOUR ATTORNEY.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.169
THAT'S IT. I'M BROKE.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.438
I GOT THIS
COURT-APPOINTED LAWYER.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.506
SHE'S A KID.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.408
MR. LaPLANTE, MY JOB TODAY

14:01.441 --> 14:04.411
IS TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION
FOR SENTENCING

14:04.444 --> 14:06.146
BASED ON THIS INTERVIEW.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.116
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
I'M NOT A CRIMINAL.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.450
BUYING STOLEN GOODS?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.252
IT'S A LITTLE TECHNICAL THING.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.420
DO I ROB ANYBODY?

14:13.453 --> 14:15.122
DO I HIT ANYBODY?

14:15.155 --> 14:18.525
YOU DON'T WANT TO CLUTTER UP
PRISONS WITH GUYS LIKE ME.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.327
PRISONS ARE FOR TOUGH GUYS--

14:20.360 --> 14:22.662
GUYS WHO LIKE
TO BEAT EACH OTHER UP

14:22.695 --> 14:24.965
LIFT WEIGHTS,
FUCK EACH OTHER.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.934
I CAN'T DO THAT KIND OF TIME.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.336
I DON'T BELONG
IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.503
GIVE ME A BREAK.

14:30.537 --> 14:34.074
LOOK, I...

14:34.107 --> 14:36.443
I GOT THIS KID--
NINE, TEN YEARS OLD.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.412
I'M TAKING HIM TO THE MOVIES
TONIGHT AFTER WORK.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.680
HE WORSHIPS ME.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.050
IF I GO TO THE SLAMMER

14:43.083 --> 14:45.518
WHAT'S THIS GOING TO DO
TO THE KID?

14:45.552 --> 14:48.621
I'M HIS GODDAMN ROLE MODEL,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

14:48.655 --> 14:52.692
I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU
HOW MUCH MY CAMERAMAN, EDITOR

14:52.725 --> 14:55.162
ASSIGNMENT EDITOR,
AND NEWS DIRECTOR--

14:55.195 --> 14:57.897
TO NAME A FEW--
DID TO GET ME THIS AWARD.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.703
THIS IS AN ONION.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.106
IT'S A METAPHOR
FOR A NEWS STORY.

15:06.139 --> 15:09.442
ONLY A FEW HOUR AGO,
I WAS STANDING ON A LEDGE

15:09.476 --> 15:11.478
60 STORIES ABOVE THE STREET

15:11.511 --> 15:13.013
INTERVIEWING A MAN

15:13.046 --> 15:15.648
WHO SUBSEQUENTLY
JUMPED TO HIS DEATH.

15:15.682 --> 15:19.987
$40 MILLION IN THE BANK,
HAPPILY MARRIED, GOOD HEALTH.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.921
GREAT STORY.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.959
BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.727
I MEAN, WE'RE PROS, RIGHT?

15:27.760 --> 15:31.564
SOME KIND OF EXTRAMARITAL
HANKY-PANKY, MAYBE?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.733
ANOTHER GREAT STORY.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.069
MAYBE THE GUY'S BEEN ACCUSED

15:36.103 --> 15:37.570
OF CHILD MOLESTING.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.439
AH, A TERRIFIC STORY!

15:39.472 --> 15:42.609
WHAT? IT TURNS OUT
THE ACCUSATIONS WERE FALSE?

15:42.642 --> 15:44.444
WONDERFUL. MORE STORY.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.747
MAYBE THE ALLEGED MISTRESS
WAS LYING.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.716
SETTING THE GUY UP, HUH?

15:49.749 --> 15:51.351
SENSATIONAL STORY.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.519
SO WE KEEP GOING.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.054
OH. EXCUSE ME.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.423
KEEP DIGGING, INVESTIGATING.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.126
WE EXPOSE
THE GUY'S WHOLE LIFE,
HIS FAMILY.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.294
WHY? BECAUSE WE'RE PROS.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.596
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE TRUTH.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.134
WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT--
AFTER ALL OUR DIGGING

16:07.167 --> 16:10.137
AFTER ALL OUR
PAINSTAKING INVESTIGATION--

16:10.170 --> 16:13.140
WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT
THERE WASN'T ANY TRUTH?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.441
JUST STORIES--

16:14.474 --> 16:17.477
ONE STORY AFTER ANOTHER,
LAYER AFTER LAYER

16:17.510 --> 16:19.446
TILL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

16:19.479 --> 16:23.016
DO WE HAVE ANY OBLIGATION
TO STOP AT ANY POINT

16:23.050 --> 16:24.384
OR DO WE JUST KEEP GOING--

16:24.417 --> 16:26.186
DIGGING, DIGGING, PEELING

16:26.219 --> 16:28.388
TILL WE'VE PEELED IT ALL AWAY?

16:28.421 --> 16:31.291
TILL WE'VE DESTROYED
WHAT WE WERE INVESTIGATING

16:31.324 --> 16:32.559
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

16:35.228 --> 16:43.036
I'LL BET ALL OF YOU, LIKE ME,
YEARN FOR JUST ONE STORY

16:43.070 --> 16:48.041
THAT ISN'T ABOUT UNVEILING
LAYER AFTER LAYER
OF HUMAN WEAKNESS--

16:48.075 --> 16:49.509
A STORY THAT REVEALS

16:49.542 --> 16:52.179
WITH EACH NEW LAYER
OF INVESTIGATION

16:52.212 --> 16:55.648
SOMETHING FINER AND NOBLER.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.385
SOMETHING EVEN...

16:58.418 --> 16:59.786
INSPIRATIONAL.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.324
( applause )

17:12.098 --> 17:14.534
NO, IT'S VERY NICE, ACTUALLY.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.536
UM...

17:16.569 --> 17:20.807
"FOR EXCELLENCE
IN THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH."

17:22.742 --> 17:26.146
LISTEN, I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW THAT I GOT A SEAT

17:26.179 --> 17:28.781
BACK ON THE EARLY FLIGHT
AFTER ALL, SO...

17:28.815 --> 17:31.418
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU GAVE IT TO CONKLIN?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.220
HE WASN'T ON THAT LEDGE.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.089
HE WASN'T THE ONE
THE GUY WANTED TO TALK TO.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.391
YOU WERE GOING TO DO
THE TOWN, REMEMBER?

17:38.425 --> 17:40.660
FANCY SUITE
AT THE STATION'S EXPENSE

17:40.693 --> 17:42.162
SEE A SHOW, GET LAID.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.396
WHAT WAS I TO DO?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.597
Cut the shit.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.866
You know
I won't hang around New York

17:46.899 --> 17:50.103
while you give away
all my stories to Conklin.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.105
OKAY, YOU GET BACK
TONIGHT, DOLL.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.441
I'LL TAKE CONKLIN
OFF YOUR SUICIDE.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.376
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE AWARD.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.479
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

17:59.512 --> 18:01.781
THEY'RE ALL ALIKE--
THE GOOD ONES.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.816
THEY'RE JUNKIES
FOR THE STORY.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.718
CAN'T LET GO.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.421
First rule out here
on the streets is

18:08.455 --> 18:10.557
you got to watch out
for number one.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.460
If you go down, break a bone,
you're gone.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.595
Nobody's going to pick you up.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.763
SHITTY COLOR.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.398
LOOK AT THE SKIN TONES.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.899
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.669
HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE SHITTY SKIN TONES.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.103
I'm not moving.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.773
* Put the blame on...

18:26.806 --> 18:28.475
You're a VIP, right?

18:28.508 --> 18:31.278
From the most beautiful place
in the world...

18:31.311 --> 18:33.346
THERE YOU GO--
SKIN TONES.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.814
YOU GOT A FISH TO CUT.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.616
I WOULDN'T EVEN DO THIS

18:36.649 --> 18:38.885
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
THESE LEGAL PROBLEMS.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.387
$95, THAT'S IT.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.389
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

18:42.422 --> 18:46.426
I GOT TO TAKE MY KID
TO THE MOVIES TONIGHT,
WINSTON.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.594
I'M LATE.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.795
FIFTY.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.530
HOW ABOUT A WATCH?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.165
WANT TO BUY A WATCH?

18:52.199 --> 18:53.833
SAME KIND I GOT, HUH?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.602
TELL YOU WHAT.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.870
GIVE ME $85
FOR THE MACHINE, THE WATCH

18:57.904 --> 19:00.373
I'LL THROW IN
A COUPLE OF WHEEL COVERS

19:00.407 --> 19:02.409
A CASE OF INSECT REPELLANT.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.710
HERE--

19:03.743 --> 19:05.612
YOU NEED A AIR FILTER?

19:08.848 --> 19:10.683
I KNOW WHY IT'S RAINING.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.685
I COULD HAVE PREDICTED IT.

19:12.719 --> 19:16.856
IT'S RAINING BECAUSE
MY GODDAMN WIPERS
ARE ALL SCREWED UP.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.691
IF MY WIPERS WERE OKAY

19:18.725 --> 19:21.828
THE GODDAMN SUN
WOULD BE SHINING AT NIGHT.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.305
OH, DAMN IT.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.442
( engine sputtering )

19:37.410 --> 19:39.546
DAMN IT.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.880
Ladies and gentlemen

19:40.913 --> 19:42.515
this is your captain.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.351
We're experiencing
a high reading

19:44.384 --> 19:45.985
on one of our indicators.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.222
Ten to one it's a malfunction
in the gauge.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.524
I'll ask you to fasten
your seat belts

19:51.558 --> 19:53.360
while the flight attendants

19:53.393 --> 19:55.528
run through
some safety procedures.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.931
MAKE SURE YOUR SEAT BELTS
ARE FASTENED SECURELY.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.401
WHEN THE CAPTAIN
GIVES THE SIGNAL

20:01.434 --> 20:03.336
YOU WILL BRACE YOUR ARMS

20:03.370 --> 20:06.706
AGAINST THE SEAT
IN FRONT OF YOU LIKE THIS.

20:06.739 --> 20:10.009
YOU MAY USE
PILLOWS AND BLANKETS

20:10.042 --> 20:11.978
TO PROTECT YOUR FACE

20:12.011 --> 20:13.746
FROM FLYING GLASS AND DEBRIS.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.382
BEFORE YOU DO THIS

20:15.415 --> 20:17.950
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE REMOVED
YOUR EYEGLASSES

20:17.984 --> 20:19.419
AND THAT YOUR SHOES...

20:19.452 --> 20:21.421
( engine sputtering )

20:34.901 --> 20:36.903
REMEMBER, OUR BIGGEST ASSET

20:36.936 --> 20:40.273
IN AN EMERGENCY
IS CALM, CLEAR THINKING.

20:40.307 --> 20:43.610
ALL OF US ON THE CREW
HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY TRAINED

20:43.643 --> 20:45.378
FOR AN EMERGENCY SUCH AS...

20:48.581 --> 20:50.550
Bernie:
COME ON, COME ON.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.918
I'M LATE ALREADY.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.520
DON'T QUIT ON ME NOW.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.589
( engine sputtering )

20:56.623 --> 20:58.525
COME ON, COME ON.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.697
( engine cranking )

21:09.936 --> 21:12.872
( jet engine roaring )

21:17.910 --> 21:20.880
( explosion )

21:31.724 --> 21:33.493
( metal scraping )

21:33.526 --> 21:34.827
( crackling )

21:34.861 --> 21:36.663
( clattering )

21:47.740 --> 21:49.342
NOW WHAT?

22:05.692 --> 22:06.926
Man:
HEY!

22:06.959 --> 22:10.363
SOMEBODY!

22:10.397 --> 22:12.098
IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.003
( thumping )

22:17.036 --> 22:18.738
IS ANYBODY THERE?

22:18.771 --> 22:22.509
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, PAL?

22:22.542 --> 22:23.943
GET OUT! GET OUT!

22:23.976 --> 22:26.546
( people moaning
and child crying )

22:30.049 --> 22:33.019
Flight attendant:
STAY CALM, EVERYONE.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.021
EVERYONE, PLEASE, STAY CALM.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.856
PLEASE DON'T PUSH.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.558
EVERYONE, PLEASE.

22:38.591 --> 22:42.094

30:39.638 --> 30:41.173
LADY, YOU'RE NOT OKAY.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.341
I'M A REPORTER.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.010
YOU'VE GOT
A BROKEN ARM.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.225
ALSO, SOME PASSENGER
PULLED ME OUT.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.893
TAKE HIM DOWN
TO THE HOSPITAL...

31:00.927 --> 31:02.528
SHE'S A REAL
PIECE OF WORK.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.063
UNBELIEVABLE!

31:04.096 --> 31:06.198
"IT'S MY STORY.
I DID THE RESEARCH"?

31:06.232 --> 31:08.234
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THE SHOT I GOT.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.368
MAJOR AWARD!

31:09.401 --> 31:11.337
I START ON THIS
FIREMAN'S FACE--

31:11.370 --> 31:13.605
FANTASTIC! YOU KNOW,
SAD BUT EXCITED.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.585
WHERE'S MY CAR?

MY CAR WAS RIGHT HERE.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.191
WHERE'S MY..?

31:32.224 --> 31:33.492
WHERE ARE YOU HURT,
SIR?

31:33.525 --> 31:34.626
WHAT? HURT?

31:34.660 --> 31:36.662
LET'S GO OVER
TO THE AMBULANCE

31:36.695 --> 31:38.164
AND CHECK YOU OUT.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.631
I DON'T NEED
AN AMBULANCE.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.367
I'M LOOKING FOR MY CAR.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.069
IT MUST HAVE BURNT UP.

31:43.102 --> 31:44.536
YOU WEREN'T IN
YOUR CAR, SIR.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.338
YOU'VE BEEN IN
AN AIRPLANE CRASH.

31:46.372 --> 31:49.942
PLEASE, MY DAUGHTER
NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION.

32:04.023 --> 32:08.995
Okay, Ray, give me one
high and outside.

32:17.169 --> 32:20.139
( car approaching )

32:26.745 --> 32:30.983
( engine sputtering )

32:44.730 --> 32:46.665
HE WAITED
FOR THREE HOURS.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.167
YOU WON'T
BELIEVE WHAT...

32:48.200 --> 32:50.002
I'M SO TIRED
OF YOUR BULLSHIT!

32:50.036 --> 32:51.303
EV, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.738
IT'S NEVER YOUR FAULT!

32:52.771 --> 32:54.206
I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU...

32:54.240 --> 32:56.675
YOU'RE GOING TO SCREW UP
YOUR SON'S LIFE

32:56.708 --> 32:59.145
AND YOU'LL NEVER
ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY!

32:59.178 --> 33:00.012
IS HE HERE?
WHO?

33:00.046 --> 33:01.080
THE FIREMAN.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.414
HE HAD AN EMERGENCY.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.416
A REAL EMERGENCY.

33:04.450 --> 33:05.651
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME IN

33:05.684 --> 33:08.354
INSTEAD OF WAKING UP
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD?

33:08.387 --> 33:10.156
IF YOU LET ME TALK,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE

33:10.189 --> 33:12.058
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.693
WHAT HAPPENED
IS THE SAME THING
THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS--

33:14.726 --> 33:17.029
YOU BLEW IT

33:17.063 --> 33:20.332
ONLY THIS TIME,
YOU BROKE YOUR SON'S
HEART INSTEAD OF MINE.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.068
HE WAS SO PROUD--

33:22.101 --> 33:25.137
LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING
TO THE MOVIES WITH HIS FATHER

33:25.171 --> 33:27.073
AND YOU LET HIM DOWN,
LIKE ALWAYS.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.575
WHAT DID YOU DO,
TAKE A MUD BATH?

33:29.608 --> 33:33.212
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL...

33:33.245 --> 33:34.713
SHUT UP, BERNIE!

33:34.746 --> 33:36.782
OH... OKAY, FORGET IT.

33:36.815 --> 33:39.585
JUST LET ME TALK
TO JOEY TO APOLOGIZE.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.187
HE'S IN BED

33:41.220 --> 33:43.289
AND YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO WAKE HIM UP

33:43.322 --> 33:44.790
AND MAKE HIM CRAZY.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.458
HE COMES HOME
FROM THE ZOO

33:46.492 --> 33:47.626
AND WANTS TO KNOW

33:47.659 --> 33:49.628
IF ELLIOT'S A WAR HERO,
LIKE YOU.

33:49.661 --> 33:52.298
HE WANTS TO KNOW HOW
MANY PEOPLE YOU KILLED.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.765
ELIOTT-- THE FIREMAN.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.301
I EXPLAINED

33:55.334 --> 33:56.668
YOUR TENDENCY
TO EXAGGERATE--

33:56.702 --> 33:58.637
HOW YOU KILLED
AS MANY PEOPLE

33:58.670 --> 34:01.507
AS THE OTHER SUPPLY CLERKS
IN YOUR OUTFIT.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.309
I DIDN'T SAY
I KILLED ANYBODY.

34:03.342 --> 34:04.810
YOU LET HIM
BELIEVE IT!

34:04.843 --> 34:07.313
THEN I HAD TO EXPLAIN
ABOUT THE HOMELESS.

34:07.346 --> 34:08.647
THE HOMELESS?

34:08.679 --> 34:11.449
HOW NOT ALL OF THEM
OWN APARTMENT COMPLEXES.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.752
HOW NOT ALL OF THEM
PLAY THE STOCK MARKET.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.654
HOW NOT ALL OF THEM
RENT BABIES

34:15.687 --> 34:17.456
WHEN THEY'RE PANHANDLING.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.558
HE'S A YOUNG BOY,
BERNIE.

34:19.591 --> 34:22.494
IMPRESSIONABLE.

34:22.527 --> 34:24.763
LISTEN, EV,
I GOT TO SEE HIM.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.264
WELL, USE THE PHONE.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.467
HE'D LOVE
TO HEAR FROM YOU.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.303
I'VE GOT VERY IMPORTANT
GODDAMN REASONS.

34:31.337 --> 34:32.771
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SHOE?

34:32.804 --> 34:34.440
NO, I DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.275
SOME FANTASTIC ADVENTURE?

34:36.308 --> 34:38.377
SOMETHING REALLY CRAZY?

34:38.409 --> 34:40.779
ALL I WAS DOING
WAS GIVING HIM ADVICE

34:40.812 --> 34:42.313
PREPARING HIM FOR LIFE.

34:42.348 --> 34:45.284
YOU DON'T WANT HIM
TO GROW UP SOFT, DO YOU?

34:45.317 --> 34:46.652
IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.286
IT'S A GODDAMN JUNGLE.

34:50.356 --> 34:52.724
WELL, BACK
TO THE JUNGLE, BERNIE.

35:52.684 --> 35:53.885
( knocking )

35:56.388 --> 35:58.790
SORRY I HAVE
TO BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.592
THIS IS FOR JOEY.

36:00.626 --> 36:05.231
A REWARD FOR THIS WALLET
HE FOUND.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.833
WHEN I RETURNED IT,
I TOLD THE GUY

36:07.866 --> 36:11.303
HE HAD TO GIVE MY KID
SOMETHING FOR FINDING IT--

36:11.337 --> 36:13.505
YOU KNOW, FOR THE HONESTY--

36:13.539 --> 36:16.375
SO THE KID WOULD LEARN
HOW HONESTY PAYS.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.812
DO YOU WANT
TO GIVE IT TO HIM, EV

36:20.846 --> 36:22.348
OR SHOULD I?

36:25.651 --> 36:27.286
RIGHT.

36:27.319 --> 36:31.857
( horn honking )

36:36.562 --> 36:40.532
( women yelling
and laughing )

36:45.337 --> 36:46.372
HEY!

36:47.639 --> 36:48.707
MORON.

36:53.679 --> 36:57.283
Man:
YOU ACTUALLY WENT INTO
A BURNING AIRPLANE?

36:57.316 --> 36:58.684
LaPlante:
INTO IT?

36:58.717 --> 37:01.487
I WAS PRACTICALLY LIVING
IN THE GODDAMN THING.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.788
EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND

37:02.821 --> 37:05.357
SOME OTHER PERSON
WANTS ME TO SAVE THEM.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.293
ALL OF A SUDDEN, BOOM!
IT EXPLODES.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.495
YOU KNOW,
I COULD BE DEAD.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.497
BUT YOU PULLED PEOPLE OUT.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.299
YOU'RE A HERO.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.533
NO, I FUCKED IT UP.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.668
I WAS TRYING
TO IMPRESS THIS KID.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.504
I WAS GOING TO RESCUE
HIS OLD MAN

37:18.537 --> 37:19.938
BUT I COULDN'T FIND HIM.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.707
HE MUST HAVE BLEW UP.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.609
I GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

37:23.642 --> 37:26.278
I DIDN'T HAVE THE NERVE
TO FACE THE KID.

37:26.312 --> 37:27.879
MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T EVEN TRY.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.381
IT WAS A BRAVE THING

37:29.415 --> 37:30.582
EVEN TO TRY.

37:30.616 --> 37:31.817
YEAH, TRY STUPID.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.989
JUST TOSS THEM

37:38.023 --> 37:40.859
IN THE BACK, PLEASE.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.595
A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD SAY

37:43.629 --> 37:45.931
THAT'S WHAT
HEROISM IS--

37:45.964 --> 37:47.766
STUPIDITY.

37:47.799 --> 37:51.437
DOING SOMETHING THAT
IF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT

37:51.470 --> 37:53.439
YOU WOULDN'T DO IT.

37:53.472 --> 37:54.806
IT'S NOT IN
YOUR INTEREST.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.408
ONE MORE.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.411
AH, GOT IT.

38:02.348 --> 38:05.584
I GUESS YOU KIND OF GOT
A DRINKING PROBLEM, HUH?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.819
I SELL THEM
AT THE RECYCLING CENTER.

38:07.853 --> 38:08.820
IT GIVES ME A LITTLE

38:08.854 --> 38:10.489
FOR GAS AND FOOD.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.023
LOOKS LIKE YOU LIVE IN HERE.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.759
I DO IN BAD WEATHER

38:13.792 --> 38:16.928
BUT MOSTLY I LIKE
CAMPING IN THE WOODS.

38:16.962 --> 38:20.031
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DOWN ON YOUR LUCK TOO.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.867
DOWN ON MY LUCK?

38:21.900 --> 38:24.770
HEY, I TOLD YOU,
A GODDAMN PLANE FELL ON ME

38:24.803 --> 38:27.806
FROM OUT OF THE SKY,
IN AMERICA, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.642
SEE THESE SHOES--
$100 PAIR OF SHOES?

38:30.676 --> 38:31.977
ONE SHOE.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.813
YOU SHOULD GIVE IT
TO SOMEBODY WITH ONE LEG.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.648
LET ME OFF
AT THE NEXT EXIT.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.350
I COULD TAKE A BUS.

38:38.384 --> 38:39.651
I KNOW A GENTLEMAN

38:39.685 --> 38:42.120
WHO SELLS STUFF
AT THE RECYCLING CENTER.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.689
HE HAS ONE LEG.

38:43.722 --> 38:44.990
IT'S THE RIGHT FOOT.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.124
SELL IT TO HIM.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.993
IF YOU GET
A COUPLE OF BUCKS

38:48.026 --> 38:49.661
IT PAYS FOR THE GAS.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.597
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY MONEY.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.000
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.702
DOWN ON MY LUCK.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.537
GOT SOME MUD ON ME, IS ALL.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.572
I GOT
A NICE APARTMENT, STEREO.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.774
WE COULD LISTEN TO YOU
ON THE NEWS.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.377
WHAT, ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET?

39:05.411 --> 39:07.713
NO. DIDN'T THEY INTERVIEW YOU?

39:07.746 --> 39:11.016
I DON'T...
I DON'T GIVE NO INTERVIEWS.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.886
THAT'S A LOT OF SHIT.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.888
KEEP A LOW PROFILE--

39:16.922 --> 39:18.657
THAT'S MY MOTTO.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.026
IT HAPPENS I GOT
SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS.

39:21.059 --> 39:24.396
MY ATTORNEYS DON'T LIKE ME
TALKING TO THE MEDIA.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.665
NOW, IF YOU COULD STEP ON IT

39:26.698 --> 39:30.001
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
IN MY OFFICE FIVE MINUTES AGO.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.170
MY SECRETARY HAS
GOT APPOINTMENTS

39:32.203 --> 39:34.139
BOOKED FOR ME, YOU KNOW?
ALL DAY.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.607
I'M VERY LATE.

39:35.641 --> 39:36.975
ONE WORD--

39:37.008 --> 39:39.077
ONE WORD, LaPLANTE,
AND YOU'RE FIRED.

39:39.110 --> 39:39.945
YOU GOT THAT?

39:39.978 --> 39:41.012
BILL...

39:41.046 --> 39:42.814
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.451
DIDN'T I SAY ONE WORD
AND YOU'RE FIRED?

39:45.484 --> 39:47.886
YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE
IT WILL BE AN EXCUSE.

39:47.919 --> 39:50.622
IT WILL BE BERNIE LaPLANTE
EXCUSE #4,106.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.858
THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES
YOU'VE GIVEN ME.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.993
I KEEP TRACK OF THEM
ELECTRONICALLY.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.495
I'VE HEARD ALL OF THEM.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.029
I GOT LEGAL PROBLEMS.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.698
THAT'S IT! YOU TALKED!

39:59.731 --> 40:01.500
YOU'RE FIRED!
OUT OF HERE!

40:01.533 --> 40:02.568
JESUS CHRIST!

40:02.601 --> 40:04.002
I GOT PEOPLE WAITING.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.704
I GOT ORDERS COMING IN.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.540
AND YOU? YOU'RE GOING
TO GO OUT LIKE THAT--

40:08.574 --> 40:11.176
MEET THE PUBLIC IN
STINKING STOCKING FEET?

40:11.209 --> 40:13.044
I ALSO HAVE
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.613
I CARE ABOUT
MY PROBLEMS

40:14.646 --> 40:16.515
AND YOU ARE ONE
OF MY PROBLEMS.

40:16.548 --> 40:17.583
I WAS DRIVING...

40:17.616 --> 40:18.884
OUT!

40:18.917 --> 40:20.986
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY MORE ABOUT THIS.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.754
A PLANE FELL ON MY HEAD.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.456
I'LL BE ON YOUR HEAD
IN A SECOND!

40:24.490 --> 40:25.591
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.758
YOU CAN'T FIND HIM?

40:26.792 --> 40:28.193
THERE'S A LOT
OF CONFUSION

40:28.226 --> 40:30.462
AROUND WHAT TOOK PLACE
LAST NIGHT.

40:30.496 --> 40:33.632
YOU SAID ALL THE PASSENGERS
WERE ACCOUNTED FOR.

40:33.665 --> 40:36.134
THE GUY WHO PULLED YOU OUT
WASN'T A PASSENGER.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.236
A FIREMAN? A PARAMEDIC?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.938
HE DIDN'T HAVE
A UNIFORM.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.941
FROM WHAT WE COULD GET,
THERE WAS A KIND OF...

40:42.974 --> 40:45.110
SORT OF A MYSTERY GUY
INVOLVED.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.913
WE'RE PIECING TOGETHER
DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.115
A MYSTERY GUY.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.950
NOT A PASSENGER.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.184
WHO?

40:53.218 --> 40:55.787
WE DON'T KNOW
WHO HE IS. HE...

40:55.821 --> 40:57.155
HE DISAPPEARED.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.791
A NON-PASSENGER,
NON-RESCUE WORKER

40:59.825 --> 41:03.128
WENT INTO A BURNING PLANE
AND PULLED ME OUT

41:03.161 --> 41:04.963
AND DISAPPEARED?

41:04.996 --> 41:08.166
APPARENTLY, THIS GUY
IS THE ONE WHO OPENED

41:08.199 --> 41:09.935
THE EMERGENCY EXIT

41:09.968 --> 41:11.703
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.171
HE SAVED EVERYBODY.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.607
BECAUSE OF HIM, THERE
WERE NO FATALITIES.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.976
I DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD BE MOVING AROUND.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.678
YOU'RE ATTACHED
OVER HERE.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.680
CHUCKY, WHERE'S YOUR CAMERA?

41:21.713 --> 41:24.049
GET THIS THING.
BRING THAT.

41:24.082 --> 41:28.186
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS CIVILIAN
RUSHES INTO THE PLANE.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.756
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

41:30.789 --> 41:33.759
UH, HE WAS...
JUST THIS FACE-- ALL DIRTY.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.561
IT JUST APPEARED.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.295
HE WAS ASKING
FOR MR. FLETCHER.

41:37.328 --> 41:41.633
MY SON AND I GOT SEPARATED
IN THE CONFUSION AND SMOKE.

41:41.667 --> 41:44.670
A VERY COURAGEOUS STEWARDESS
AT THE EXIT

41:44.703 --> 41:48.273
TOLD ME MY BOY HAD GOTTEN OUT,
SO I GOT OUT TOO

41:48.306 --> 41:50.942
BUT MY SON HAD ALREADY TOLD
THIS MAN

41:50.976 --> 41:53.211
THAT I WAS STILL IN THERE.

41:55.814 --> 41:58.283
Boy:
I THOUGHT MY DAD WAS STILL...

41:58.316 --> 41:59.985
STILL IN THERE.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.788
SO I ASKED THE MAN
TO SAVE MY FATHER.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.557
WHAT DID THE MAN SAY,
RICHIE?

42:06.091 --> 42:09.227
HE SAID, UH...

42:09.260 --> 42:11.763
HE SAID... "I'LL SAVE HIM."

42:11.797 --> 42:14.299
HE SAID,
"I'LL SAVE YOUR FATHER."

42:15.767 --> 42:16.668
THANKS.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.138
I need a medic here!

42:53.171 --> 42:55.140
I need a medic.

42:55.173 --> 42:56.608
Jonesy!

42:57.643 --> 42:58.877
Holy shit!

42:58.910 --> 42:59.845
Gayley:
NOW FREEZE!

42:59.878 --> 43:01.747
GO BACK, YOU MISSED IT.

43:05.751 --> 43:08.219
KEEP GOING,
KEEP GOING.

43:09.955 --> 43:10.856
BACK.

43:12.390 --> 43:15.026
NOW.
GO FORWARD AGAIN.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.728
MISSED IT AGAIN.

43:27.706 --> 43:30.075
THERE.

43:30.108 --> 43:31.943
RIGHT THERE.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.081
THAT'S HIM?

43:36.114 --> 43:38.416
WE'VE ACCOUNTED
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

43:38.449 --> 43:39.885
THAT'S OUR HERO.

43:39.918 --> 43:41.386
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE
THE GUY.

43:41.419 --> 43:43.354
I WAS INTO
THE FOREGROUND DRAMA--

43:43.388 --> 43:45.791
HEROIC FIREMAN
LOOMING IN THE FRAME.

43:45.824 --> 43:48.159
CAN WE DO SOME
ELECTRONIC ENHANCEMENT?

43:48.193 --> 43:50.662
GET A CLEAR PICTURE,
IDENTIFY HIM?

43:56.001 --> 43:57.969
FAR OUT!

43:58.003 --> 43:59.805
NEVER SAW HIM.

43:59.838 --> 44:01.406
IT'S THE CAMERA.

44:01.439 --> 44:03.775
IT HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

44:03.809 --> 44:06.978
AT TIMES, I FEEL
AS IF WE WERE ONE

44:07.012 --> 44:10.882
TOGETHER CAPTURING
LITTLE MOMENTS OF HISTORY

44:10.916 --> 44:14.085
IN A KALEIDOSCOPE
OF COLORS AND DRAMA.

44:23.428 --> 44:25.196
Woman:
THERE'S NO FACE.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.398
THERE'S NOTHING REALLY
TO WORK WITH.

44:27.432 --> 44:30.068
BIG DOTS-- THAT'S
ALL YOU'RE GOING TO GET.

44:30.101 --> 44:31.402
LOOK AT
THAT GUY.

44:31.436 --> 44:34.272
HE JUST SAVED 54 PEOPLE

44:34.305 --> 44:38.243
AND NOW
HE'S GOING TO DISAPPEAR.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.011
WHO IS HE?

44:40.045 --> 44:42.814
( loud snoring )

44:48.053 --> 44:49.220
"I'll save him."

44:49.254 --> 44:51.489
He said,
"I'll save your father."

44:51.522 --> 44:55.060
All of a sudden, this civilian

44:55.093 --> 44:57.796
he rushed into the plane.

44:57.829 --> 45:00.231
Leslie, the other
flight attendant

45:00.265 --> 45:02.233
told me the guy dragged me

45:02.267 --> 45:04.202
to the exit.

45:04.235 --> 45:07.205
Leslie:
"Here, give this guy a hand,"
he said.

45:07.238 --> 45:09.274
And the next thing I knew

45:09.307 --> 45:12.010
he was going back in there

45:12.043 --> 45:14.012
into all that smoke.

45:14.045 --> 45:16.748
Gayley:
Out of the darkness

45:16.782 --> 45:19.250
out of the smoke and the fear

45:19.284 --> 45:22.053
came a man with no name,
no uniform

45:22.087 --> 45:24.389
but an abundance of courage--

45:24.422 --> 45:27.492
A man who was thinking
not about himself

45:27.525 --> 45:31.496
but about others,
risking his own life for ours.

45:31.529 --> 45:34.465
He's out there now, somewhere

45:34.499 --> 45:36.534
and whoever you are

45:36.567 --> 45:40.438
I, and the other survivors
of Flight 104, say...

45:41.873 --> 45:43.341
...thank you.

45:43.374 --> 45:45.376
God bless you.

45:45.410 --> 45:51.850
( "The Battle Hymn
of the Republic" playing )

45:56.087 --> 45:58.857
NOT BAD, BUT YOU SHOULD
FEATURE THE CAST MORE.

45:58.890 --> 46:00.558
IT'S PART OF THE STORY.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.228
NETWORK'S TAKING
EVERYTHING WE GIVE THEM.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.030
THEY WANT A FEED
OFF OUR 6:00

46:05.063 --> 46:07.933
WHETHER WE FIND
THE MYSTERY GUY OR NOT.

46:07.966 --> 46:09.534
WE'RE VERY BIG NATIONALLY.

46:09.567 --> 46:11.069
IT'S A WONDERFUL PIECE.

46:11.102 --> 46:12.470
EMOTIONAL.
I LOVE IT.

46:12.503 --> 46:14.572
WE'LL FEATURE
GALE'S CAST MORE.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.375
MY CAST IS INTERESTING
UNTIL THE HERO SHOWS UP.

46:17.408 --> 46:19.210
WHOEVER HAS HIM
HAS THE STORY.

46:19.244 --> 46:21.046
GOOD REASON FOR YOU
TO FIND HIM.

46:21.079 --> 46:22.580
YOU SHOULD BE
OUT DIGGING.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.215
HOW ABOUT OFFERING
A REWARD

46:24.249 --> 46:27.018
IN EXCHANGE FOR
AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW?

46:27.052 --> 46:29.287
MONEY AND NEWS, WALLY--
DANGEROUS WATERS.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.056
YEAH? SPEAKING.

46:31.089 --> 46:33.358
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

46:33.391 --> 46:35.226
OF COURSE YOU KNOW.
HE SAVED YOU.

46:35.260 --> 46:36.561
THEY FOUND WHAT?

46:36.594 --> 46:38.496
A phone check with survivors

46:38.529 --> 46:41.066
confirmed that the shoe
does not belong

46:41.099 --> 46:44.035
to any of the passengers
or crew of Flight 104.

46:44.069 --> 46:47.105
However, several witnesses
recall the mysterious man

46:47.138 --> 46:48.874
who saved 54 people

46:48.907 --> 46:51.009
referring to his missing shoe.

46:51.042 --> 46:52.343
The conclusion is

46:52.377 --> 46:54.012
the unknown hero

46:54.045 --> 46:57.548
known to many as
"The Angel of Flight 104"

46:57.582 --> 46:59.550
wears a size 10-B.

46:59.584 --> 47:02.253
Evelyn:
JOEY, DINNER, NOW!
TURN THAT THING OFF.

47:02.287 --> 47:04.022
MOM! MOM!

47:04.055 --> 47:05.323
HE LOST HIS SHOE.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.025
HE LOST HIS SHOE.

47:07.058 --> 47:08.393
HE LOST HIS SHOE.

47:08.426 --> 47:09.494
WHO LOST HIS SHOE?

47:09.527 --> 47:11.062
THE UNKNOWN HERO.

47:11.096 --> 47:12.363
WASH YOUR HANDS.

47:12.397 --> 47:15.200
THEY FOUND HIS SHOE
BESIDE THE PLANE CRASH.

47:15.233 --> 47:16.367
SUPERMAN, YOU MEAN?

47:16.401 --> 47:17.535
LOST HIS SHOE?

47:17.568 --> 47:19.237
WHAT NEXT?

47:19.270 --> 47:22.040
ELLIOT, THE MAN SAVED
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

47:22.073 --> 47:24.209
54. I WAS THERE,
REMEMBER?

47:24.242 --> 47:27.478
DO YOU KNOW WHY NONE OF US
RUSHED IN THAT PLANE?

47:27.512 --> 47:29.180
WE'RE TRAINED FIREMEN

47:29.214 --> 47:31.516
PART OF A TEAM--
A DISCIPLINED TEAM.

47:31.549 --> 47:34.652
WE TAKE CHANCES ALL THE TIME,
SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES

47:34.685 --> 47:36.654
BUT WE DON'T DO
CRAZY THINGS.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.990
THIS GUY DOES
SOMETHING REALLY DUMB

47:39.024 --> 47:40.491
AND HE LUCKS OUT.

47:40.525 --> 47:44.362
SO THE MEDIA GO CRAZY
OVER HIS SHOE, FOR GOD SAKES.

47:44.395 --> 47:48.033
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE ARE THEY
GIVING TO THE YOUTH, HUH?

47:48.066 --> 47:49.434
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE

47:49.467 --> 47:51.502
ARE YOU GIVING
TO THE YOUTH?

47:51.536 --> 47:55.040
SNEERING AT SOMEONE FOR
STICKING HIS NECK OUT.

47:55.073 --> 47:57.542
YOU SOUND LIKE MY EX--
MR. CYNICISM.

47:57.575 --> 47:59.277
SO WHAT CAN I SAY?

47:59.310 --> 48:01.646
GIVE YOUR EX CREDIT
FOR BEING SMART ENOUGH

48:01.679 --> 48:04.049
NOT TO DO
SOMETHING STUPID.

48:04.082 --> 48:06.184
MAYBE THE GUY'S
NOT ALL BAD.

48:06.217 --> 48:07.452
I'M GOING TO WATCH TV

48:07.485 --> 48:10.655
AND HOPE IT'S NOT
ALL THIS SUPERMAN STUFF.

48:13.258 --> 48:17.562
MOM, MY FATHER
ONLY HAD ONE SHOE ON

48:17.595 --> 48:19.697
WHEN HE CAME HERE.

48:19.730 --> 48:23.668
YOU WERE IN BED,
WEREN'T YOU?

48:23.701 --> 48:26.304
I SAW HIM OUT THE WINDOW.

48:26.337 --> 48:28.006
UH-HUH.

48:28.039 --> 48:29.674
AND YOU THINK
YOUR FATHER

48:29.707 --> 48:31.642
WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

48:31.676 --> 48:33.178
RESCUE PEOPLE?

48:33.211 --> 48:36.681
YOUR FATHER IS
BERNIE LaPLANTE.

48:36.714 --> 48:39.350
IT'S AGAINST
HIS RELIGION

48:39.384 --> 48:41.953
TO STICK HIS NECK OUT.

48:45.323 --> 48:47.692
SIT DOWN.

48:47.725 --> 48:49.694
The warden of a Montana prison

48:49.727 --> 48:53.364
insists that the unknown hero
is a dangerous child molester

48:53.398 --> 48:55.733
who escaped
from the institution in April.

48:55.766 --> 48:57.602
As far away as Scotland

48:57.635 --> 49:01.739
the leader of a religious sect
claims the mysterious hero

49:01.772 --> 49:05.110
is, in fact, an angel
anticipated in scripture.

49:05.143 --> 49:06.544
HEY, BERNIE.

49:06.577 --> 49:08.579
HOW'S IT GOING?

49:08.613 --> 49:10.715
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW, CHICK.

49:10.748 --> 49:12.750
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.752
THOSE GUYS BEEN IN YET?

49:14.785 --> 49:16.754
YOU IN BUSINESS
WITH THEM GUYS?

49:16.787 --> 49:18.756
'CAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT
A PROBLEM

49:18.789 --> 49:20.591
FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.527
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
A PROBLEM

49:22.560 --> 49:24.662
BECAUSE I HAVE GOT
THEM ALL.

49:24.695 --> 49:26.164
I CORNERED THE MARKET.

49:26.197 --> 49:28.733
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

49:28.766 --> 49:31.336
I WAS TAKING MY CAR
TO GET MY KID...

49:31.369 --> 49:32.403
( door closes )

49:32.437 --> 49:33.338
OH.

49:34.572 --> 49:36.241
HOW YOU DOING?

49:36.274 --> 49:38.043
BROUGHT SOME FRIENDS,
OKAY?

49:38.076 --> 49:39.510
OH, YEAH, SURE.

49:39.544 --> 49:41.379
EXCUSE ME, CHICK.

49:41.412 --> 49:45.250
In addition, we bring you
a special announcement

49:45.283 --> 49:47.518
from Channel 4 Station Manager

49:47.552 --> 49:49.787
James Wallace.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.056
Good evening.

49:51.089 --> 49:52.723
We at Channel 4, like you

49:52.757 --> 49:56.461
have been stirred
by the courage and humanity
of this...

49:56.494 --> 49:58.063
WHAT YOU GOT
THERE FOR US?

49:58.096 --> 49:59.130
MORE PLASTIC?

49:59.164 --> 50:00.231
YEAH, PLASTIC.

50:00.265 --> 50:01.766
PREMIUM STUFF HERE.

50:01.799 --> 50:04.102
HIGH LIMITS.
NOT REPORTED.

50:04.135 --> 50:06.237
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT REPORTED?

50:06.271 --> 50:08.573
BECAUSE I KNOW.
TRUST ME ON THIS.

50:08.606 --> 50:11.576
HEY, HOMBRE, HE DON'T
EVEN TRUST HIS MOTHER.

50:11.609 --> 50:13.411
WHY HE GOING
TO TRUST YOU?

50:13.444 --> 50:15.246
'CAUSE I'M NOT
HIS MOTHER.

50:15.280 --> 50:17.048
HEY, HOMBRE, POR AQUI.

50:17.082 --> 50:21.119
...like you, we want to see
what is best in us.

50:21.152 --> 50:24.455
We want to examine it,
and for that reason

50:24.489 --> 50:26.124
we at Channel 4

50:26.157 --> 50:29.260
have decided to offer
this unknown hero

50:29.294 --> 50:31.329
a reward of $1 million.

50:31.362 --> 50:33.598
HOW MANY YOU GOT,
EIGHT? TEN?

50:33.631 --> 50:36.634
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE
THAT PLANE CRASH GUY

50:36.667 --> 50:38.303
A MILLION-DOLLAR REWARD.

50:38.336 --> 50:39.770
A MILLION BUCKS?

50:39.804 --> 50:41.306
WHAT PLANE CRASH GUY?

50:41.339 --> 50:42.640
THE ONE-SHOE DUDE.

50:42.673 --> 50:45.243
THE GUY THAT SAVED
ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

50:45.276 --> 50:48.079
CHANNEL 4
IS GOING TO GIVE THIS GUY

50:48.113 --> 50:50.581
A MILLION DOLLARS
JUST FOR AN INTERVIEW.

50:50.615 --> 50:51.649
DAMN.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.418
A MILLION BUCKS.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.654
HEY, HEY, HOMBRE

50:56.687 --> 50:59.224
WE'RE TRYING TO DO
SOME BUSINESS HERE.

50:59.257 --> 51:00.725
YOU GOT MORE
OF THESE?

51:00.758 --> 51:02.127
A MILLION DOLLARS?

51:02.160 --> 51:03.228
HEY...

51:03.261 --> 51:04.362
I'M THE GUY.

51:04.395 --> 51:05.796
I GOT AN APPOINTMENT.

51:05.830 --> 51:08.065
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

51:12.203 --> 51:13.438
BULLSHIT!

51:13.471 --> 51:15.273
LaPLANTE, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

51:15.306 --> 51:17.175
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

51:17.208 --> 51:18.843
DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

51:18.876 --> 51:21.312
DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE
I GOT THE PLASTIC?

51:21.346 --> 51:22.580
CALL MY ATTORNEY.

51:22.613 --> 51:24.649
HOLD IT, I GOT
A MILLION BUCKS..!

51:34.225 --> 51:36.194
$1 MILLION
TO THE ANONYMOUS HERO!

51:36.227 --> 51:39.197
ONE MILLION BUCKS
TO THE ANGEL

51:39.230 --> 51:41.399
WHO SAVED 50 PEOPLE
AND TAKES OFF!

51:41.432 --> 51:44.402
NOW, PLEASE, IF YOUR FOOT
ISN'T A SIZE 10-B

51:44.435 --> 51:46.437
DON'T REMAIN IN LINE.

51:46.471 --> 51:48.873
WE'RE ONLY LOOKING
FOR SIZE 10-B HEROES.

51:48.906 --> 51:50.608
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS!

51:50.641 --> 51:52.443
HEY, IT AIN'T JUST ME.

51:52.477 --> 51:55.413
EVERYBODY IN LINE KNOWS
YOU'RE NOT THE HERO.

51:55.446 --> 51:57.248
THAT'S A RACIST
PERSPECTIVE--

51:57.282 --> 51:59.850
ASSUMING BECAUSE
SOMETHING HEROIC WAS DONE

51:59.884 --> 52:01.519
A WHITE MAN DONE IT.

52:01.552 --> 52:03.654
A MAN WITH MUD
ON HIS FACE

52:03.688 --> 52:05.290
COULD BE ANY COLOR.

52:05.323 --> 52:07.925
MOST LIKELY WAS, WHICH
IS TRUE IN THIS CASE

52:07.958 --> 52:10.428
'CAUSE IT WAS ME...
WITH MUD ALL OVER ME.

52:10.461 --> 52:11.929
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

52:11.962 --> 52:13.764
THERE MUST BE
A THOUSAND PHONIES

52:13.798 --> 52:14.899
AFTER MY REWARD.

52:14.932 --> 52:16.501
MISS GAYLEY, IT'S ME!

52:16.534 --> 52:18.536
I SAVED YOUR LIFE,
REMEMBER?

52:18.569 --> 52:20.471
MY FOOT IS ONLY AN 81/2

52:20.505 --> 52:22.940
BUT I WEAR A 10-B
FOR COMFORT, I SWEAR.

52:22.973 --> 52:25.310
THERE'S A COP
LOOKING FOR YOU--

52:25.343 --> 52:27.212
INSPECTOR DAYTON--
WANTS YOU TO CALL.

52:27.245 --> 52:28.279
WHAT ABOUT?

52:28.313 --> 52:29.380
I DIDN'T ASK.

52:29.414 --> 52:30.881
CALL BACK AND FIND OUT.

52:30.915 --> 52:32.250
I'M REAL BUSY.

52:32.283 --> 52:33.318
EXCUSE ME.

52:39.557 --> 52:42.327
Judge:
BAIL IN THIS MATTER
WILL REMAIN AT $5,000.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.295
THE ANGEL OF FLIGHT 104?

52:44.329 --> 52:46.497
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE THE ANGEL OF..?

52:46.531 --> 52:47.965
"ANGEL" IS A LITTLE STRONG.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.368
I GOT TO GET
TO THE TV STATION

52:50.401 --> 52:52.303
AND GET MY MILLION BUCKS.

52:52.337 --> 52:54.372
THE PEOPLE v.
BERNARD LaPLANTE.

52:54.405 --> 52:56.674
THAT'S ME!
I'M MR. LaPLANTE.

52:56.707 --> 52:59.744
THE D.A. IS ASKING
THAT YOUR BAIL BE SET

52:59.777 --> 53:01.979
AT $25,000 BECAUSE
YOU WERE ARRESTED

53:02.012 --> 53:03.814
WHILE AWAITING SENTENCING.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.483
25 GRAND IS PEANUTS.

53:05.516 --> 53:08.286
JUST GET ME OUT
LONG ENOUGH TO COLLECT.

53:08.319 --> 53:09.820
MY ATTORNEY SAYS
THE PROSECUTOR

53:09.854 --> 53:10.955
WANTS 25 GRAND
FOR BAIL.

53:10.988 --> 53:12.990
MR. LaPLANTE,
YOU'LL BE SILENT

53:13.023 --> 53:14.859
UNTIL THE COURT
RECOGNIZES YOU.

53:14.892 --> 53:16.827
I GOT NO PROBLEM
WITH THAT.

53:16.861 --> 53:18.363
IN FACT, YOUR HONOR

53:18.396 --> 53:20.231
I'D BE PROUD
TO DOUBLE IT.

53:20.265 --> 53:22.833
50 GRAND...
FOR THE PEOPLE.
LIKE A TIP.

53:22.867 --> 53:25.670
( gavel sounding )
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

53:25.703 --> 53:28.273
IF YOU DON'T STOP CHATTERING
IMMEDIATELY

53:28.306 --> 53:30.241
I WILL ASK THE BAILIFF TO...

53:38.683 --> 53:39.584
I...

53:39.617 --> 53:40.785
SAID...

53:40.818 --> 53:42.787
I WANT...

53:42.820 --> 53:44.755
ORDER!

53:44.789 --> 53:46.257
SORRY, YOUR HONOR.

53:46.291 --> 53:47.525
WE GOT
CARRIED AWAY.

53:47.558 --> 53:48.593
THEY FOUND HIM.

53:48.626 --> 53:49.660
FOUND WHO?

53:49.694 --> 53:51.862
THE ANGEL OF FLIGHT 104.

53:53.531 --> 53:56.601
IT WAS ON THE NEWS, SIR,
JUST NOW.

53:56.634 --> 53:59.537
HE'S GOING TO BE ON CHANNEL 4
AT NOON.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.509
THE BAIL REMAINS $25,000.

54:04.542 --> 54:07.345
THAT OUGHT TO KEEP YOU
OUT OF TROUBLE.

54:07.378 --> 54:08.746
YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENT...

54:08.779 --> 54:10.815
YOUR CLIENT IS
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

54:10.848 --> 54:12.049
TWELVE NOON, HUH?

54:12.082 --> 54:13.284
CHANNEL 4.

54:25.963 --> 54:28.699
I WAS OUT IN THE WOODS...

54:28.733 --> 54:31.402
AND...

54:31.436 --> 54:36.073
I HEARD A HUGE CRASH...

54:36.106 --> 54:40.411
AND I SAW FLAMES...

54:40.445 --> 54:43.414
AND I WENT OVER THERE
TO TAKE A LOOK.

54:48.553 --> 54:54.325
AND EVERYTHING THERE
WAS LIKE A BLUR.

54:54.359 --> 54:56.927
THERE WAS A LOT OF SMOKE...

54:56.961 --> 54:58.896
AND SCREAMING.

55:00.898 --> 55:03.100
UH, I WAS ACTUALLY
RELIEVED

55:03.133 --> 55:05.770
THAT IT WAS JUST
A PLANE CRASH

55:05.803 --> 55:07.472
AND I COULD HELP.

55:12.477 --> 55:15.613
BUT I DON'T HAVE
A DETAILED MEMORY OF IT.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.648
IT WAS TOO SCARY.

55:17.682 --> 55:20.485
TELL US WHY
YOU DISAPPEARED, JOHN.

55:22.086 --> 55:23.721
Well, uh...

55:26.557 --> 55:29.460
At first
I didn't know I was a hero.

55:29.494 --> 55:32.930
I thought the boy's father
hadn't survived

55:32.963 --> 55:37.802
and I had failed him,
and I couldn't face the boy.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.404
And then...

55:43.474 --> 55:45.543
After that, uh...

55:45.576 --> 55:48.513
Well, I've been, uh...

55:48.546 --> 55:51.582
I've been down on my luck
lately

55:51.616 --> 55:56.621
and I just didn't really, uh,
feel too presentable.

55:56.654 --> 55:58.723
But you did come forward.

55:58.756 --> 56:00.491
Why?

56:02.059 --> 56:03.594
The money.

56:08.032 --> 56:10.801
I wouldn't have come forward
if it wasn't for...

56:10.835 --> 56:12.637
if it wasn't for the money.

56:12.670 --> 56:13.871
Gayley:
GO BACK.

56:13.904 --> 56:17.141
( tape rewinding )

56:17.174 --> 56:18.676
CUT.

56:18.709 --> 56:20.010
RIGHT THERE.

56:20.044 --> 56:21.712
RIGHT ON THAT LOOK.

56:21.746 --> 56:24.081
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
HE WAS SO CUTE.

56:27.217 --> 56:29.153
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

56:31.722 --> 56:33.658
The survivors
were shocked to learn

56:33.691 --> 56:36.827
that the hero who pulled them
to safety was indigent

56:36.861 --> 56:38.496
and hadn't slept

56:38.529 --> 56:40.164
in a bed in three years.

56:40.197 --> 56:42.700
John Bubber was living
in his car

56:42.733 --> 56:45.202
at the time
of the nearly tragic crash

56:45.235 --> 56:47.938
surviving by
collecting bottles and cans...

56:47.972 --> 56:49.440
OH, HE'S A FAKE.

56:49.474 --> 56:50.808
YOU KNOW HIM?

56:50.841 --> 56:52.477
HE'S A GODDAMN FAKE.

56:52.510 --> 56:54.445
HE'S A GODDAMN HOMELESS BUM.

56:54.479 --> 56:55.780
HE AIN'T NO HERO.

56:55.813 --> 56:59.784
YOU CAN TRUST ME THAT MUCH.

56:59.817 --> 57:01.952
FUCK YOU!

57:01.986 --> 57:04.221
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

57:04.254 --> 57:06.957
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE HOMELESS?

57:10.094 --> 57:12.997
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THEY'D
ALL GO, "IT'S HIM"

57:13.030 --> 57:15.666
AND WANT TO HUG THE GUY
OR SOMETHING.

57:15.700 --> 57:18.703
HE HAD THE SHOE,
AND THE SHOE CHECKED OUT.

57:18.736 --> 57:20.671
THIS MEANS
I COULD STOP WORRYING?

57:20.705 --> 57:22.707
WHERE ARE WE
PUTTING HIM UP?

57:22.740 --> 57:24.041
DRAKE HOTEL.

57:24.074 --> 57:25.876
NEVER STOP WORRYING.

57:25.910 --> 57:28.946
WE'LL DO A SIDEBAR ON GOING
FROM SLEEPING IN YOUR CAR

57:28.979 --> 57:31.816
TO SLEEPING
IN THE POSHEST SUITE IN TOWN.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.984
ALSO, GALE'S CHECKING
INTO HIS BACKGROUND.

57:34.018 --> 57:36.987
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE,
DIRT OR MORE POETRY?

57:37.021 --> 57:38.956
WE KNOW WHAT YOU PREFER.

57:38.989 --> 57:40.991
INSPECTOR DAYTON'S RECOVERED
YOUR CREDIT CARDS.

57:41.025 --> 57:42.993
HE'S THAT COP
FROM ROBBERY DETAIL.

57:43.027 --> 57:45.530
THEY CAUGHT THE GUY
WHO STOLE THEM.

57:45.563 --> 57:47.064
NOBODY STOLE MY CREDIT CARDS.

57:47.097 --> 57:49.199
THEY WERE BURNED UP
IN THE CRASH.

57:49.233 --> 57:50.801
YOU GOT MY MONEY?

57:50.835 --> 57:52.737
WHAT ABOUT THE RESERVATIONS?

57:52.770 --> 57:54.905
TWO AT 8:00
AT THE BARCELONA.

57:54.939 --> 57:56.774
$400 FOR DINNER?

57:56.807 --> 57:58.242
SHE'S TAKING
MR. BUBBER

57:58.275 --> 57:59.777
TO DINNER
AT THE BARCELONA.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.245
BUBBER? TO DINNER?

58:01.278 --> 58:03.080
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

58:03.113 --> 58:05.082
CHUCKY,
COME IN HERE, CHUCKY.

58:05.115 --> 58:07.117
THIS IS PRIVATE
AND PERSONAL.

58:07.151 --> 58:08.553
HE'S A NEWS STORY.

58:08.586 --> 58:10.555
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.707
THANK YOU.

01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:14.311
THEY'RE ALL LOOKING AT US.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.413
NOT US, JOHN.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.182
THEY'RE USED
TO CELEBRITIES HERE.

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:19.684
LISTEN, MISS GAYLEY...

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:20.617
GALE.

01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:24.388
GALE.

01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:26.924
I DIDN'T MEAN TO, UH...

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:30.327
IT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED,
THAT REWARD.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.196
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK...

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:34.064
THANK YOU.

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:36.433
ALL I WANTED
WAS A SQUARE MEAL

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.935
MAYBE A BATH

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.170
A NIGHT BETWEEN
CLEAN SHEETS.

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:42.272
I WASN'T AFTER
A MILLION DOLLARS.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:46.276
WHAT'S A GUY LIKE ME
GOING TO DO
WITH A MILLION DOLLARS?

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:49.680
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE PRICES
AND SAY THAT.

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.985
YOU MESS WITH ME

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.253
I'LL CUT YOUR HEART OUT
AND EAT IT!

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:58.122
STOP IT, STOP IT!

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.757
OH, YOU'RE SUCH
A BRUTE.

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:01.759
COME ON!

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.228
COME ON!

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:05.963
VERY GOOD, SIR.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.132
IT'S A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE
TO SERVE YOU.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.466
OH, THANK YOU...

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:10.968
AND YOU.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.336
YOU WERE SAYING

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:14.304
YOU DON'T WANT
A MILLION DOLLARS?

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.006
I'M NOT ENTITLED TO IT.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.307
I DIDN'T EXPECT...

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:19.009
...ALL THE ADULATION?

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:21.178
MAKES YOU FEEL
LIKE A FAKE?

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:23.948
YES. I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER COME FORWARD.

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:26.316
YOU'RE A CREDIT
TO THE GODDAMN HUMAN RACE.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.885
WELL, I WOULDN'T PUT IT...

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:29.954
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME
ON THAT PLANE

01:01:29.987 --> 01:01:31.856
OR MY FAMILY.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:34.391
YOU'RE A CELEBRITY NOW.

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:37.027
PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO WANT TO PLEASE YOU...

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:38.763
OR USE YOU, OR BOTH.

01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:41.766
( reporters shouting )

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.028
MR. BUBBER.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.363
MR. BUBBER,
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD...

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:16.033
YOU COULD...

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.169
YOU WANT ME
TO SIGN THIS?

01:02:19.203 --> 01:02:21.105
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:22.239
SYLVIA.

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:25.843
SYLVIA.

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:27.912
SYLVIA, IF I SIGN THIS
FOR YOU

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:30.180
WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:33.217
ALL RIGHT, WHAT I'D LIKE IS,
AND MAYBE

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:37.121
SOME OF THE REST OF YOU
CAN HELP SYLVIA HERE

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:40.324
I'D LIKE YOU TO SCROUNGE UP
SOME BLANKETS...

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:43.160
OLD ONES, MAYBE 50.

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:47.865
TAKE THEM DOWN TO THE CORNER
OF FIFTH AND GRAND

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:49.967
AND PASS THEM OUT.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.136
Man:
FIFTH AND GRAND?

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:54.171
Boy:
HE MEANS THE HOMELESS.

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:55.840
THE BUMS.

01:02:55.873 --> 01:02:57.174
IT'S COLD OUT THERE.

01:02:57.207 --> 01:02:59.243
YOU'LL FEEL WARMER

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.778
FOR EVERY PERSON
YOU GIVE A BLANKET TO.

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.825
I'LL BET THEY'LL DO IT.

01:03:14.859 --> 01:03:16.994
I'LL BET THEY'LL GET
SOME BLANKETS.

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:22.599
WHAT YOU DID
WAS SO UPLIFTING.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.501
YOU'RE A SAINT, JOHN BUBBER.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:25.870
YOU THINK SO?

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:27.271
MAYBE YOU SHOULD UP...

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:29.073
SUPPORT THE...

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:32.242
UP THE SUPPORT
FOR THE NEEDY...

01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:35.412
SHE COULD SUPPORT
THE ENTIRE CHICAGO BULLS.

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:37.414
GOOD NIGHT.

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:40.450
I THINK I'D BETTER
SEE YOU TO YOUR ROOM.

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:41.986
KIND OF A BODYGUARD.

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:50.861
UM... COULD YOU MAYBE SUPPORT
A SMALL AIRFIELD?

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:56.133
GALE, UH...

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:59.469
IT'S BEEN SOME TIME
SINCE I'VE RECEIVED

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:02.306
THAT KIND OF ATTENTION.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.174
IT'S BEEN SEVERAL YEARS.

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:05.509
YEARS?

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.277
YES.

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:09.013
HUH.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:11.916
WELL, THERE WILL BE
PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.483
YOU'RE A VERY NICE PERSON.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.252
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:16.620
I KNOW.

01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:18.588
YOU THINK I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:20.157
I CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.591
YOU DID SAVE ME

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:24.929
AND THAT'S ME--
I'D BE TAKING ADVANTAGE.

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:26.897
I'M A REPORTER.

01:04:26.931 --> 01:04:29.199
I'M...

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:31.035
I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE A PROFESSIONAL.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:42.379
I CAN'T DO THIS.

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:45.415
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:47.484
I DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT, HUH?

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:49.419
YOU'RE A NEWS STORY.

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:52.957
A NEWS STORY, RIGHT.

01:05:01.065 --> 01:05:02.366
GOOD NIGHT.

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:04.935
I KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT YOU, JOHN.

01:05:04.969 --> 01:05:08.105
THEY'RE FLYING IN GUYS FROM
YOUR UNIT IN VIETNAM TOMORROW.

01:05:08.138 --> 01:05:10.540
VIETNAM?

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:11.942
GOOD NIGHT.

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:19.083
Smoke, mortar fire.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:23.253
People screaming.

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:26.156
We would have all died
in that rice paddy

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:28.292
if it hadn't been
for Johnny Bubber.

01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:30.294
Gayley:
What did he do?

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:32.329
He pulled us out.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:34.965
He pulled us out one by one.

01:05:34.999 --> 01:05:37.267
I wouldn't be giving
no TV interview.

01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:41.972
I'd be lying in my grave
if it hadn't been for Johnny.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.275
Why didn't he get a medal?

01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:48.412
Wasn't no officers around
to write him up.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:51.615
It didn't surprise me
that he was the one

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:54.318
that saved all those people
in the plane.

01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:57.587
He was always thinking about
the other guy before himself.

01:05:57.621 --> 01:06:00.057
After an emotional reunion

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.693
Bubber's fellow veterans
watched as station manager
James Wallace

01:06:03.727 --> 01:06:06.496
presented Bubber with a check
for one million dollars.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:10.134
As Bubber reacted
to his sudden wealth

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:12.569
word came that the Secretary
of the Navy

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:16.106
responding to an urgent
resolution of the Senate

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:20.244
has conferred upon John Bubber
the Medal of Honor.

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:22.446
Bubber:
When you're out on the streets

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.481
whether it's living
in your car

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:26.116
or sleeping under bridges

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:28.518
even worse than the hunger
is the feeling

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:30.354
that
you're just plain useless--

01:06:30.387 --> 01:06:32.656
that you don't matter
to a single soul

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:34.191
in the entire world.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:35.659
Nobody really needs you.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.494
Nobody really wants you.

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:39.529
So I guess I...

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:42.166
I did what I did

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:45.735
because I think
I was really trying

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:49.206
to save my life
more than anything else.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.808
I was trying to connect myself
with people again.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.444
Trying to be part of the whole

01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:57.714
and you have to help others
in order to do that.

01:06:57.747 --> 01:07:00.650
You need a role to play--

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:02.419
even a humble role--

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:04.388
that gives you self worth.

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:05.722
I'm not one

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.358
of those guys that say
money isn't important.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:12.396
When you're down on your luck
like I was

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:15.165
a buck can be the difference
between life and death

01:07:15.199 --> 01:07:17.201
but money isn't everything.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:19.303
Even millionaires
commit suicide.

01:07:19.336 --> 01:07:21.638
HE IS LIKE THAT
IN REAL LIFE?

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:23.340
SO GORGEOUS?

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.475
HE'S PRETTY REMARKABLE.

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:27.677
YOU DIDN'T
GET IT ON WITH HIM.

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:29.679
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.082
I'M A REPORTER.

01:07:32.116 --> 01:07:33.550
REPORTERS
DON'T HAVE HORMONES?

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:36.620
REPORTERS HAVE TO RISE
ABOVE THEIR HORMONES.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:38.555
He needs to be a person.

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:40.257
THE GUY IS A NATURAL.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:41.825
He needs to be

01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:43.560
part of society.

01:07:43.593 --> 01:07:45.529
You can do that

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.431
by helping those

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:49.666
who need help.

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:51.368
You've helped me.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.237
You've made me a hero.

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:55.139
It makes you a hero.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:01.811
If we help each other,
we can all be heroes together.

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:04.514
WE'RE ALL HEROES, HUH?

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:06.516
ASSHOLE.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.385
LaPLANTE, BERNARD.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.853
ME?

01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:11.621
YOU MADE BAIL, ACE.

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:13.390
ME?

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.159
Man:
YOU LUCKY THEY TAKING
YOUR ASS

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:16.826
OUT OF HERE, BOY.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.828
HOW DID YOU GET ME OUT?

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:22.366
I TOOK A LOAN ON MY CAR
AND MY COMPUTER.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.167
YOU PAID A DEPOSIT
OF 10%?

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:26.370
I WAS INSPIRED
BY THE HERO--

01:08:26.403 --> 01:08:28.772
HOW HE STUCK
HIS NECK OUT FOR OTHERS

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.474
HOW HE TOOK A CHANCE.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.776
THAT FAKE INSPIRED YOU
TO LOAN ME--

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:35.312
A GUY WHO'S PROBABLY
GOING TO DO TIME?

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:37.314
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ATTORNEY.

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:39.316
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE
GOOD JUDGEMENT.

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:42.352
AS YOU POINT OUT,
I AM RELATIVELY INEXPERIENCED.

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:44.921
MY NAIVETE MAY HAVE WORKED
TO YOUR BENEFIT.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:46.490
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.492
I'M GLAD YOU GOT ME OUT.

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:50.694
I APPRECIATE IT.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:52.595
OH, MISS O'DAY...

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.631
MISS O'DAY, COME HERE.

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:57.434
NOW THAT YOU LOANED ME
2,500 PLUS

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:00.170
CAN I HAVE $20
FOR CAB FARE, PLEASE?

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.406
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
MISS O'DAY?

01:09:04.408 --> 01:09:06.310
I READ
THE PROBATION REPORT

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:08.745
AND IT'S NOT GOOD.

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:11.348
BERNIE, I THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO PRISON.

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:14.584
WELL, AT LEAST I'M GOING
TO GET MY MILLION BUCKS.

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:17.421
I SEEN WHERE THAT
DO-GOODER IS GOING

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:19.889
TO A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
TO VISIT SICK KIDS.

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:21.925
HE'S GOT TO BE STOPPED.

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:24.294
WHO, JOHN BUBBER?

01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:26.296
LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE TO YOU.

01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:27.564
HE'S MAKING PEOPLE WACKO.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:28.932
I MEAN WACKO.

01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:30.300
WACKO, WACKO, WACKO.

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:31.935
( horn honking )

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:52.522
Boy:
WHEN'S HE COMING?

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.358
I WANT TO SEE BUBBER.

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:00.930
YOU, LEAVE!

01:10:00.964 --> 01:10:03.233
LEAVE!

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:07.404
IS THAT HIM?

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:09.005
NO, IT'S JUST
SOME GUY.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.707
MAY I HELP YOU?

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.242
WELL...

01:10:12.276 --> 01:10:13.910
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE.

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:16.846
IF YOU WANT TO
ARRANGE A VISIT,
PLEASE GO DOWNSTAIRS.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.382
HI.

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:19.849
Bubber:
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, CHAMP?

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.385
JOSE.

01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:22.752
HI, JOSE.

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:23.887
HI, BEAUTIFUL.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.555
I'M MANDY.

01:10:25.589 --> 01:10:26.690
HI. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.425
CODY.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:29.893
CODY, I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:31.895
CAN I GET
YOUR AUTOGRAPH?

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:33.897
DID YOU SAVE
ALL THOSE PEOPLE?

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.832
YES,
ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:37.834
Woman:
THIS WAY PLEASE.

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:40.236
Bubber:
HI.

01:10:43.507 --> 01:10:44.908
EXCUSE ME.

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.776
I JUST WANT TO...

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:47.944
YOU GOT
A PRESS PASS, SIR?

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:49.479
I FORGOT IT.

01:10:49.513 --> 01:10:51.515
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

01:10:51.548 --> 01:10:52.882
IS HE HERE?

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.951
I WANT
TO SEE HIM FIRST.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.786
IS HE HERE?

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.059
LISTEN, KID...

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:05.061
YOU GOT TO HANG ON.

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.963
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:09.299
WE ALL GET SCARED.

01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:11.935
THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE TO FIGHT.

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:13.470
ALLEN'S IN A COMA.

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:14.938
HE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:16.373
HE CAN HEAR ME.

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:20.377
LISTEN, ALLEN...

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:25.549
OKAY.

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:31.421
LISTEN, ALLEN

01:11:31.455 --> 01:11:34.057
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THE DARKNESS
IN THERE.

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:36.360
I KNOW IT'S SCARY.

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:38.995
NOW, THE DOCTORS
ARE TRYING THEIR BEST

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:41.030
BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT.

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:42.832
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:45.835
YOU GOT TO COME
OUT OF THE DARKNESS.

01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:48.738
I WANT YOU TO STRUGGLE
FOR ME, ALLEN.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.510
YOU'RE A HERO.

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:55.545
YOU CAN'T QUIT.

01:11:55.579 --> 01:11:59.416
HEROES NEVER QUIT.

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:01.017
COME ON, THIS IS A HOSPITAL.

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.386
LET'S COOPERATE.

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:04.388
LET'S KEEP THIS AREA CLEAR

01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:06.723
UNLESS YOU HAVE
HOSPITAL BUSINESS.

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:09.559
COME ON, FELLA, HOW'S
ABOUT SOME COOPERATION?

01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:12.396
HEY, BUDDY, YOU'RE
WITH THE MEDIA, RIGHT?

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:13.863
I GOT A STORY FOR YOU.

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:15.865
BUBBER-- HE'S A FAKE.

01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:17.767
I'M TALKING TO YOU!

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:19.736
LaPlante:
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:21.070
( crowd clapping )

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:24.374
BUBBER! REMEMBER ME?
REMEMBER ME?

01:12:24.408 --> 01:12:26.042
( crowd cheering )

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.645
I LOVE YOU, JOHN BUBBER.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:30.780
LaPlante:
YOU PHONY!

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:37.454
THANKS FOR HELPING.

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:39.155
LaPlante:
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.657
YOU GOT MY SHOE.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.492
WHERE'S MY MONEY?

01:12:42.526 --> 01:12:43.993
I WANT MY MONEY.

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.996
YOU FAKE! YOU PHONY!

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.065
YOU HEAR ME?

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:51.100
DON'T PUSH!

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:53.537
THAT'S MY SHOE AND MY MONEY!

01:12:55.472 --> 01:12:58.442
( playing
"Marine Corps Hymn" )

01:13:11.988 --> 01:13:14.491
COME ON, UP, UP,
RISE AND SHINE.

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:16.593
WATCH IT, YOU BIG BOZO!

01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:21.164
DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT I CAN OR CANNOT SAY!

01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:22.666
THIS IS AMERICA.

01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:24.701
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:26.436
TO INSULT
THE VERY BRAVE MAN

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:29.172
WHO'S WORTH A THOUSAND
OF YOU, GO AHEAD.

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:31.841
LIKE HE SAYS,
WE'RE ALL HEROES, PAL.

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:33.176
BULLSHIT.

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:36.179
THAT'S A LOT OF BULLSHIT.

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:38.181
OKAY, HAVE IT
YOUR OWN WAY.

01:13:38.214 --> 01:13:40.484
YOU'RE NOT A HERO.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:57.233
Announcer:
John Bubber himself

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:01.471
along with 20 of the real
survivors of Flight 104.

01:14:01.505 --> 01:14:05.108
See the real-life participants
reenact the terrifying drama

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:07.110
inside the burning plane.

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:08.978
Out of the darkness

01:14:09.012 --> 01:14:11.247
the fire, a nightmare of fear

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.850
came The Angel of Flight 104.

01:14:13.883 --> 01:14:16.219
John Bubber saved 54 people.

01:14:16.252 --> 01:14:20.056
This is his story and theirs--

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.225
a drama
featuring the actual people

01:14:22.258 --> 01:14:25.629
who actually lived
those moments of terror.

01:14:25.662 --> 01:14:27.697
No makeup,
no music, no actors.

01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:29.566
This is the real thing.

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:31.701
Thursday night, Channel 4.

01:14:31.735 --> 01:14:33.503
Be there.

01:14:35.605 --> 01:14:36.640
ALL RIGHT.

01:14:36.673 --> 01:14:37.741
UPSET?

01:14:37.774 --> 01:14:39.208
WHAT'S HE UPSET ABOUT?

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:41.277
HE SAID
HE'S NOT AN ACTOR.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.279
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ACTOR.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.948
HE'S A REAL-LIFE HERO.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:47.951
ALL HE HAS TO DO IS ACT
LIKE A REAL-LIFE HERO.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.053
THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF THE CONCEPT--

01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:51.788
THE WHOLE FRESHNESS OF IT.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:53.256
DID SHE CALL HIM BACK?

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:54.791
SHE'S TALKING TO HIM.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.025
WALLY.

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:58.094
WE PAID HIM
A MILLION DOLLARS.

01:14:58.127 --> 01:15:01.097
YOU'D THINK HE'D WANT
TO COOPERATE A LITTLE--

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:03.032
HELP US WITH OUR RATINGS.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.969
HOW DID IT GO?

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:07.671
WELL, HE'LL DO IT.

01:15:07.704 --> 01:15:10.874
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE TALKED
TO HIM FIRST, YOU KNOW.

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:14.878
Back in the news again,
John Bubber.

01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:18.214
The man who saved 54 people
from a burning plane

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.849
has apparently awakened...

01:15:19.883 --> 01:15:22.552
HEY, I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR BEING SORE.

01:15:22.586 --> 01:15:23.953
I KNOW I SCREWED UP

01:15:23.987 --> 01:15:25.689
FOR GETTING BUSTED
IN HERE.

01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:27.857
YOU GOT THE RIGHT
TO KICK ME OUT.

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:30.293
Young Allen Baird
had been unconscious

01:15:30.326 --> 01:15:33.129
since an automobile accident
five days ago.

01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:35.231
Bubber insisted
on talking to Allen

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:37.166
though doctors discouraged it

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.837
saying the boy couldn't hear
Bubber's encouragement...

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.206
I'M NOT GOING TO KICK YOU OUT,
BERNIE.

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:45.008
...suddenly and unexpectedly

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.342
regained consciousness.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.745
The doctors who had believed

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:51.748
the boy had little
or no chance of survival

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:54.183
now predict the slow
but complete recovery.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:55.719
THANKS, CHICK.

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:57.053
I APPRECIATE IT.

01:15:57.086 --> 01:15:58.688
HELL OF A GUY.

01:15:58.722 --> 01:16:00.690
VIETNAM, PLANE CRASH...

01:16:00.724 --> 01:16:02.726
NOW MIRACLES.

01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:06.195
Allen himself
has yet to comment.

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.364
A nurse who was with him says

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.199
his first words were

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:13.169
"Could you ask my mom
to make me some pancakes?"

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:15.772
JUST A REHEARSAL.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:17.273
ACTION.

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:18.775
Gayley:
JOHN.

01:16:18.808 --> 01:16:20.109
WHAT?

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:21.845
COME HERE, COME HERE.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:24.781
AND THEN YOU LEAN DOWN
AND FREE ME FROM THE SEAT.

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:26.916
REMEMBER? I WAS CAUGHT,
AND YOU...

01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:28.384
LIKE THAT...

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.920
YEAH, RIGHT, LIKE THAT.

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:33.690
AND THEN YOU HELPED ME UP.

01:16:40.163 --> 01:16:41.597
YEAH.

01:16:42.866 --> 01:16:44.300
BOY, YOU SEEM TALLER.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.169
MUST BE PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:48.337
NOW THAT I KNOW
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.106
OH, GALE, I CAN'T...

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:52.709
THIS IS WRONG.

01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:54.043
I CAN'T DO THIS.

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:56.045
I CAN'T GO THROUGH
WITH THIS.

01:16:56.079 --> 01:16:57.180
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:16:58.614
IT'S OKAY.

01:17:02.719 --> 01:17:04.353
NO, WAIT.

01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:06.389
YOU DIDN'T LIFT ME, THOUGH.

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:08.057
WAIT. PUT ME DOWN.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:09.893
PUT ME DOWN.

01:17:09.926 --> 01:17:11.227
COME ON.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.330
IT WAS MORE, UM...
LIKE YOU SUPPORTED ME.

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.365
YOU WERE LIKE THIS.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:18.067
LIKE THAT.

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:21.037
YEAH. IT WAS KIND OF SEXY.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:24.007
YOU CAN SUPPORT ME
ANY TIME, JOHN.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.374
OH, GALE.

01:17:25.408 --> 01:17:27.043
THIS IS NO GOOD.

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:29.178
YOU KNOW
WHAT I JUST REMEMBERED?

01:17:29.212 --> 01:17:30.847
YOU WERE, LIKE, SWEARING

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.682
AND TALKING
ABOUT BODY BUILDING.

01:17:32.716 --> 01:17:33.983
BODY BUILDING?

01:17:34.017 --> 01:17:36.352
GUYS,
THIS HAS TO PLAY SERIOUS.

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:39.856
JOHN, COULD YOU LIFT HER MORE
AND CARRY HER LIKE THIS?

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:42.058
I THINK IT WILL PLAY BETTER.

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:45.361
GALE, IF YOUR ARTISTIC
AND JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:48.698
CAN HANDLE IT, IT WILL LOOK
FABULOUS ON THE SCREEN.

01:17:48.732 --> 01:17:51.034
TAKE THIS THROUGH
TO THE END, PLEASE.

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:53.336
THEN WE'LL PUT JOHN
IN HIS MUD MAKEUP

01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:55.204
AND DO A TAKE
FROM THE TOP.

01:17:55.238 --> 01:17:56.339
THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:57.841
IT'S OKAY.

01:17:57.874 --> 01:18:00.043
IT JUST LOOKS
BETTER THIS WAY.

01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:02.746
I DIDN'T HAVE MY PURSE
THEN THOUGH.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:05.048
YOU'RE AN INSPIRATION, JOHN.

01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:08.217
YOU'RE MAKING US
BETTER HUMAN BEINGS--

01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:11.220
LESS CYNICAL, MORE OPEN,
MORE GIVING.

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:13.957
DO YOU REALIZE THAT?

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.294
YEAH.

01:18:22.398 --> 01:18:23.967
OH, MY GOODNESS.

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:29.105
YOU LEAVE HER HERE

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:31.775
AND YOU GO BACK INSIDE
FOR MR. SMITH.

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:34.110
MR. SMITH?

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:35.344
RIGHT.

01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:39.015
MR. SMITH?

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:42.886
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I TOLD YOU I RAN INTO
A BURNING PLANE

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:44.754
AND SAVED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

01:18:44.788 --> 01:18:46.756
AND RISKED MY LIFE?

01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:48.892
YOU MEAN LIKE BUBBER?

01:18:48.925 --> 01:18:50.526
THE HERO?

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.762
YEAH.

01:18:52.796 --> 01:18:55.064
LIKE THAT. SAME THING.

01:18:55.098 --> 01:18:57.100
WELL, I MEAN, UH...

01:18:57.133 --> 01:19:00.103
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY HERE, BERNIE?

01:19:00.136 --> 01:19:02.238
IS THIS LIKE A RIDDLE
OR SOMETHING?

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:04.240
I MEAN...

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:09.278
IF I SAID IT,
WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME?

01:19:09.312 --> 01:19:11.280
YOU WOULDN'T, WOULD YOU?

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:12.782
WELL, I MEAN

01:19:12.816 --> 01:19:14.417
IT'S A CHARACTER THING,
BERNIE.

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:16.052
YOU WOULDN'T DO IT.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.021
NO OFFENSE. ME EITHER.

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:20.456
BUBBER, THOUGH, HE'S
A CERTAIN KIND OF GUY.

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:21.891
HE'S HEROIC.

01:19:21.925 --> 01:19:23.426
YOU AND ME, WE'RE NOT.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:24.861
IT'S NOT OUR NATURE.

01:19:24.894 --> 01:19:26.863
IT DON'T MEAN
WE'RE BAD OR NOTHING.

01:19:26.896 --> 01:19:28.431
WE'RE JUST NOT
SO INCLINED.

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:29.966
WHAT ABOUT IT?

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:31.801
DON'T BE DEPRESSED, BERNIE.

01:19:31.835 --> 01:19:35.004
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A HERO
TO BE A HUMAN BEING.

01:19:35.038 --> 01:19:37.406
THE THING IS, CHICK,
I'M GOING DOWN.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.942
YOU MEAN JAIL

01:19:38.975 --> 01:19:40.877
FOR THAT CREDIT CARD STUFF?

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:42.178
JESUS, BERNIE.

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:43.546
NOT JAIL. PRISON.

01:19:43.579 --> 01:19:45.481
NOT THAT CREDIT CARD BULLSHIT.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:47.016
THAT'S NOTHING.

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.551
I GOT A CONVICTION.

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:50.219
SENTENCING TOMORROW.

01:19:50.253 --> 01:19:52.822
SOME CASES OF PAINT
I GOT INVOLVED WITH.

01:19:52.856 --> 01:19:54.223
LATEX.

01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:55.859
I SEE THIS
PROBATION OFFICER.

01:19:55.892 --> 01:19:58.527
HE WRITES A LETTER
TO THE JUDGE

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:01.130
SAYS I'M...

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:03.132
ANTISOCIAL.

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:04.467
ANTISOCIAL?

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.135
JESUS, BERNIE.

01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:08.938
HOW MUCH PAINT
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

01:20:08.972 --> 01:20:12.876
A LOT.

01:20:12.909 --> 01:20:16.379
Director: I THINK
WE'VE ALL DONE SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT TODAY.

01:20:16.412 --> 01:20:18.214
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.

01:20:18.247 --> 01:20:19.883
EXCELLENT JOB.
GOOD WORK.

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:21.284
TAKE CARE OF THAT EYE.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.152
OKAY. NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:20:23.186 --> 01:20:25.154
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:20:25.188 --> 01:20:28.324
KEEP STUDYING.
YOU'LL BE A BIG ACTRESS.

01:20:28.357 --> 01:20:29.625
BYE.

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.494
JOHN, JOHN.

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.529
POWERFUL STUFF,
VERY POWERFUL.

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:34.998
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:36.599
LET'S KEEP IN TOUCH, OKAY?

01:20:36.632 --> 01:20:39.135
WHAT'S IT ABOUT,
ANYWAY?

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:41.337
CAN WE GO SOMEWHERE
AND TALK?

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:44.040
OH, MY GOODNESS.

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:47.043
JUST LET ME GET
THAT GUNK OFF YOUR FACE.

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:48.411
MR. BUBBER...

01:20:48.444 --> 01:20:51.915
JOHN, WOULD YOU SIGN
KELLY'S BUBBER DOLL?

01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:53.316
BUBBER DOLL?

01:20:55.218 --> 01:20:58.521
IT WON'T TAKE MORE THAN
TEN MINUTES OF YOUR TIME.

01:20:58.554 --> 01:20:59.655
15 AT THE MOST.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:02.125
I'LL BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE.

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:06.395
Bubber:
GALE?

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:08.031
GALE!

01:21:09.966 --> 01:21:12.568
SO HOW DOES THIS,
WHAT'S HIS NAME, SLEAZEBAG

01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:14.237
SAY HE GOT MY CARDS?

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:15.905
BERNARD LaPLANTE?

01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:18.641
THIS BOZO GOT MORE STORIES
THAN A NEWSPAPER.

01:21:18.674 --> 01:21:21.978
ONE OF THEM, HE SAYS
HE'S THE ANGEL OF FLIGHT 104.

01:21:22.011 --> 01:21:23.612
PULLS YOU OFF THE PLANE

01:21:23.646 --> 01:21:26.249
SAVES YOUR PURSE,
AND FORGETS TO RETURN IT

01:21:26.282 --> 01:21:28.017
AND THAT'S VERSION 63.

01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:30.353
VERSION 64,
HE SAYS HE KEPT IT

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:32.488
TO PAY FOR HIS
HUNDRED-DOLLAR SHOES.

01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:35.191
THE GUY'S A TWO-BIT
BULLSHIT ARTIST.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:39.095
ALREADY GOT A SENTENCE PENDING
FOR DEALING STOLEN GOODS.

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:42.498
LISTEN, THIS GUY--
THE HERO

01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:45.001
BUBBER-- HE WAS
A HOMELESS GUY, RIGHT?

01:21:45.034 --> 01:21:47.270
I MEAN, HE WAS
DOWN ON HIS LUCK.

01:21:47.303 --> 01:21:49.939
HE COULDN'T HAVE SWIPED
YOUR PURSE, COULD HE

01:21:49.973 --> 01:21:51.607
WHILE HE WAS RESCUING YOU

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.177
AND SOLD IT
TO THIS GUY LaPLANTE?

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:57.981
JOHN BUBBER RISKS HIS LIFE
TO SAVE ME AND 54 OTHER PEOPLE

01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:59.348
AND SWIPES MY PURSE?

01:22:01.084 --> 01:22:02.551
TOO FARFETCHED.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:04.253
LISTEN, I'M NOT TRYING

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:06.422
TO MAKE PROBLEMS
FOR JOHN BUBBER.

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:08.257
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:10.960
THIS LaPLANTE GUY
DOES SOME MEANINGFUL TIME.

01:22:12.328 --> 01:22:14.330
TELL ME MORE ABOUT HIM.

01:22:14.363 --> 01:22:15.731
HOMEWORK.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:18.134
YOU'RE DOING
YOUR HOMEWORK, REMEMBER?

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:19.535
( phone ringing )

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:22.438
HOMEWORK, HOMEWORK,
HOMEWORK, HOMEWORK!

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.373
NO HOMEWORK, NO ZOO TRIPS,
NO MOVIES.

01:22:24.407 --> 01:22:26.075
HELLO?

01:22:26.109 --> 01:22:27.643
HE'S DOING
HIS HOMEWORK.

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:29.178
IT'S YOUR FATHER.

01:22:29.212 --> 01:22:32.448
IF YOU DON'T TALK TO HIM,
HE'LL CALL ALL NIGHT.

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:35.751
HEY, JOEY, HOW YOU DOING, PAL?

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.453
IT'S ME, YOUR OLD MAN.

01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:39.422
DID YOU GET THE $20?

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:40.756
WHAT?

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:43.092
OH, WELL,
SHE'S RIGHT ON THAT, JOEY.

01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:45.094
THAT'S THE BEST PLACE FOR IT.

01:22:45.128 --> 01:22:46.429
YEAH, COLLEGE FUND.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.998
I WAS GOING
TO TELL YOU THAT MYSELF.

01:22:49.032 --> 01:22:52.768
LOOK,
ABOUT HOW I DIDN'T SHOW UP
THE OTHER NIGHT, I JUST...

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:56.005
WHAT? YOU SEEN ME
OUT THE WINDOW?

01:22:56.039 --> 01:22:59.275
ONE SHOE, YEAH, AND THE MUD.

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:02.678
SO YOU THOUGHT
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THE HEROIC GUY.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.748
YEP.

01:23:05.781 --> 01:23:08.017
AND WHAT DID SHE SAY
WHEN YOU..?

01:23:09.452 --> 01:23:11.287
AGAINST MY RELIGION, HUH?

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.756
WELL, YOU KNOW, JOEY,
THIS KIND OF STUFF

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:16.759
WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT
SOMETIME MAN-TO-MAN

01:23:16.792 --> 01:23:20.096
BUT LISTEN, I GOT TO GO AWAY
ON THIS BUSINESS TRIP

01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:22.431
SO I WON'T BE SEEING YOU
FOR A WHILE

01:23:22.465 --> 01:23:25.134
AND YOU GOT TO LISTEN
TO YOUR MOTHER

01:23:25.168 --> 01:23:26.602
BECAUSE SHE'S SMART.

01:23:26.635 --> 01:23:28.237
SHE'S VERY SMART.

01:23:28.271 --> 01:23:30.506
YOU KNOW, SHE KNOWS
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

01:23:30.539 --> 01:23:32.041
NO.

01:23:32.075 --> 01:23:33.376
NO.

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:34.510
NO!

01:23:34.543 --> 01:23:36.412
NO!

01:23:36.445 --> 01:23:39.048
JOEY, IT AIN'T BECAUSE
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

01:23:39.082 --> 01:23:41.717
CHRIST! I MEAN, NOT CHRIST.

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.719
YOU KNOW, I DON'T...

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:47.190
I DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY
ON THIS BUSINESS TRIP.

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:52.528
I LOVE YOU.

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:54.230
BUT I GOT TO...

01:23:54.263 --> 01:23:56.399
THAT'S PART OF GROWING OLDER.

01:23:56.432 --> 01:24:00.103
IT'S ALL THESE GODDAMN--
PARDON THE EXPRESSION--

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:02.438
BUSINESS THINGS
YOU HAVE TO DO.

01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:05.774
WHICH REMINDS ME, YOU KNOW,
THIS HERO BUSINESS?

01:24:05.808 --> 01:24:08.744
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'LL LEARN
AS YOU GROW...

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:10.746
AS, AS, AS YOU GROW OLDER

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:13.282
IS THAT
LIFE GETS VERY COMPLICATED.

01:24:13.316 --> 01:24:14.750
WE'RE NATURALLY...

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:18.754
IT'S... YOU KNOW, LIKE PEOPLE
AREN'T EXACTLY LIKE THEY SEEM.

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.456
NOTHING IS.

01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:25.161
LIFE GETS
UN-UN-UN-UNBELIEVABLE.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:28.864
THIS IS NORMAL
AS YOU GROW OLDER.

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:32.801
I-I WOULD... I WOULD HAVE
SEEN YOU THAT NIGHT.

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:37.440
I WAS TALKING TO JOEY.

01:24:37.473 --> 01:24:40.409
YOUR SON ACTUALLY WANTS
TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

01:24:40.443 --> 01:24:42.478
IF YOU LET HIM DOWN THIS TIME

01:24:42.511 --> 01:24:44.513
AFTER POPPING BACK
INTO HIS LIFE...

01:24:44.547 --> 01:24:46.182
YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND.

01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:48.317
IT'S THIS GODDAMN
BUSINESS TRIP...

01:24:48.351 --> 01:24:50.119
PLEASE DON'T HANG UP.

01:24:50.153 --> 01:24:51.820
WAIT A SECOND, EV, PLEASE?

01:24:51.854 --> 01:24:53.722
JUST LET ME SAY ONE THING.

01:24:59.795 --> 01:25:03.199
( theme from Close Encounters
of the Third Kind playing )

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:06.502
LOOK, I KNOW I KIND OF ACT
LIKE AN ASSHOLE SOMETIMES.

01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:07.803
I KNOW THAT.

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:11.607
I KNOW YOU WERE A GOOD...

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.242
WIFE.

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:17.546
I KNOW I FUCKED IT UP.

01:25:21.684 --> 01:25:23.886
I HAD A GOOD THING. I BLEW IT.

01:25:28.424 --> 01:25:30.659
I JUST... I JUST...

01:25:36.765 --> 01:25:39.702
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I KNOW THAT.

01:25:39.735 --> 01:25:41.504
THAT'S ALL.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.347
I GOT TO GO NOW.

01:25:53.849 --> 01:25:55.751
BUSINESS TRIP, YOU KNOW.

01:25:55.784 --> 01:25:57.720
BE A WHILE.

01:25:57.753 --> 01:25:58.921
OKAY?

01:25:58.954 --> 01:26:01.857
I'M SORRY I TOOK SO MUCH TIME.

01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:20.576
BERNIE.

01:26:20.609 --> 01:26:22.711
BERNIE!

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:27.316
HEY, LaPLANTE, OPEN THE DOOR!

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:28.851
TELEVISION INTERVIEW.

01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:31.287
FAME AND FORTUNE.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.557
GEEZ, I HOPE THE SILLY BASTARD
DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF.

01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:37.893
HE'S BEEN VERY UPSET
ABOUT THIS SENTENCE
THAT HE GOT.

01:26:37.926 --> 01:26:40.195
HE'S GOING TO PRISON.

01:26:42.965 --> 01:26:45.501
HEY, IS THAT A CAMERA
YOU'RE CARRYING?

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:47.836
IF HE KILLED HIMSELF
YOU COULD TAKE PICTURES.

01:26:57.846 --> 01:26:59.715
TOO BAD,
NO DEAD BODY.

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:03.352
I SUPPOSE IT'S NOT TOO OFTEN
YOU GET TO TAKE PICTURES

01:27:03.386 --> 01:27:05.554
OF THE BODY
BEFORE THE COPS ARRIVE.

01:27:05.588 --> 01:27:06.955
EXCLUSIVE.

01:27:06.989 --> 01:27:09.325
MR, WINSTON, I WONDER
IF YOU'D MIND

01:27:09.358 --> 01:27:10.626
IF WE WAITED HERE.

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:13.396
WHAT'S HE GOING
TO DO-- SUE?

01:27:13.429 --> 01:27:16.031
HE'S LUCKY THAT A PERSON
LIKE YOURSELF...

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.700
A CELEBRITY
LIKE YOURSELF

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:19.702
WOULD TAKE AN INTEREST
IN HIM.

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:22.405
WHAT HE DO,
SOME KIND OF DRUG THING?

01:27:22.438 --> 01:27:24.373
WE'RE NOT REALLY
FREE TO SAY.

01:27:24.407 --> 01:27:26.809
OF COURSE,
I UNDERSTAND.

01:27:26.842 --> 01:27:28.744
IT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

01:27:28.777 --> 01:27:31.947
OKAY, IT'S PERSONAL.

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.950
OKAY, WELL, I'LL WATCH IT
ON TELEVISION.

01:27:35.884 --> 01:27:37.953
ALL RIGHT.

01:27:40.423 --> 01:27:41.724
OKAY.

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:43.659
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

01:27:43.692 --> 01:27:45.494
THIS GUY COULD BE HOURS.

01:27:45.528 --> 01:27:47.663
I HAVE A FEELING
HE'S IMPORTANT SOMEHOW.

01:27:47.696 --> 01:27:49.998
LISTEN, I KNOW
YOU'RE THIS CAREER FIEND

01:27:50.032 --> 01:27:52.501
BUT I'VE GOT
A WIFE AND FAMILY.

01:27:52.535 --> 01:27:54.002
WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY,
CHUCKY. OW!

01:27:54.036 --> 01:27:55.671
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

01:27:55.704 --> 01:27:56.872
THIS SOFA.

01:27:56.905 --> 01:27:58.574
WHAT IS IT?

01:28:04.347 --> 01:28:06.081
THE SILVER MIC AWARD.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:09.552
HOW DID A GUY LIKE LaPLANTE
GET AN AWARD?

01:28:09.585 --> 01:28:12.621
"FOR EXCELLENCE
IN THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH."

01:28:12.655 --> 01:28:13.822
LaPLANTE?

01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:15.591
SHH!

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:17.660
( footsteps approaching )

01:28:17.693 --> 01:28:19.595
( whispering: )
CAMERA, CHUCKY.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.367
ARE YOU

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.934
BERNARD LaPLANTE?

01:28:25.968 --> 01:28:26.902
WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP

01:28:26.935 --> 01:28:27.970
WITH JOHN BUBBER?

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:29.605
TURN THAT...

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:30.706
YOU?!
HOW DID YOU

01:28:30.739 --> 01:28:31.774
ACQUIRE THIS?

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:33.075
HOW DO YOU THINK?

01:28:33.108 --> 01:28:34.510
PUT THAT DOWN.

01:28:34.543 --> 01:28:37.380
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET JOHN BUBBER TO DO?

01:28:37.413 --> 01:28:39.081
BUBBER'S GOING TO JUMP!

01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:40.783
IT'S ON CHANNEL 13.

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:41.684
13!

01:28:43.085 --> 01:28:46.722
Officials say they cannot
rig a net below him

01:28:46.755 --> 01:28:49.658
because it may trigger
his decision to jump.

01:28:49.692 --> 01:28:51.460
Bubber has said

01:28:51.494 --> 01:28:53.095
he will only talk
with Gale Gayley.

01:28:53.128 --> 01:28:54.963
THE PHONE, QUICK!

01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:56.799
IT'S OVER HERE.

01:28:56.832 --> 01:28:58.634
HE'S GREEN,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.436
NO SHIT.

01:29:00.469 --> 01:29:02.004
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF ME.

01:29:02.037 --> 01:29:03.872
IT'S A PIECE OF SHIT.

01:29:03.906 --> 01:29:05.541
YOU GOT TO ADJUST IT.

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:07.676
DON'T TOUCH IT,
SCUMBAG!

01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:09.712
YOU'LL SCREW IT UP MORE.

01:29:09.745 --> 01:29:11.714
TELL HIM I'M ON MY WAY.

01:29:11.747 --> 01:29:13.081
LET'S GO, CHUCKY.

01:29:13.115 --> 01:29:15.083
POLICE ESCORT
WILL PICK US UP.

01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:16.752
LaPLANTE,
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

01:29:16.785 --> 01:29:17.853
ME?

01:29:17.886 --> 01:29:19.755
IF YOU'RE NOT
IN THAT VAN

01:29:19.788 --> 01:29:21.757
THE COPS
WILL PICK YOU UP.

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:23.826
WHAT KIND OF BULLSHIT
IS THIS?

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:25.894
LET'S SEE
IF MONEY CAN TALK.

01:29:25.928 --> 01:29:27.863
CHUCKY, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:29.765
GIVE MR. LaPLANTE
YOUR MONEY.

01:29:29.798 --> 01:29:31.099
COME ON, LET'S GO.

01:29:31.133 --> 01:29:34.069
YOU MEDIA PEOPLE
THINK YOU CAN JUST BUY PEOPLE.

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:36.505
HEY, THAT'S
ALL I HAVE.

01:29:36.539 --> 01:29:38.541
A BIG-TIME CAMERAMAN
LIKE YOU?

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:41.009
( siren wailing )

01:29:41.043 --> 01:29:45.981
LaPlante:
THIS NUT CASE GOES OUT
ON A LEDGE AND IT'S MY FAULT?

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:49.151
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO JOHN,
I WILL SEE YOU PROSECUTED.

01:29:49.184 --> 01:29:52.154
WHAT, IS EVERYBODY
IN LOVE WITH THIS BOZO?

01:29:52.187 --> 01:29:55.157
YES, THE WHOLE COUNTRY,
AND THEY WON'T BE HAPPY

01:29:55.190 --> 01:29:58.794
IF HE LEAPS TO HIS DEATH
BECAUSE HE WAS BLACKMAILED...

01:29:58.827 --> 01:30:01.630
BLACKMAILED?!
I BLACKMAILED HIM?

01:30:01.664 --> 01:30:04.066
JUST 'CAUSE THE COPS
AREN'T ON TO YOU

01:30:04.099 --> 01:30:05.734
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE HOME FREE.

01:30:05.768 --> 01:30:07.436
I'VE SEEN
YOUR KIND BEFORE--

01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:09.037
THE UNDERBELLY OF CRIME.

01:30:09.071 --> 01:30:11.640
IN ALL THAT SMOKE AND FLAME

01:30:11.674 --> 01:30:13.141
JOHN HAD
A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS.

01:30:13.175 --> 01:30:16.612
IT WAS AN IMPULSE,
STEALING MY PURSE.

01:30:16.645 --> 01:30:18.947
HE STOLE YOUR PURSE
WHILE SAVING YOU?

01:30:18.981 --> 01:30:22.885
AND SOLD IT TO MR. LaPLANTE,
WHO'S TRYING TO
BLACKMAIL JOHN.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.820
HE SAVES THOSE PEOPLE

01:30:24.853 --> 01:30:26.221
THEN SWIPES
YOUR PURSE?

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.457
BECAUSE HE WAS
A REAL HERO.

01:30:28.491 --> 01:30:29.892
HE DIDN'T EXPECT A REWARD.

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:32.895
HE SAVED 54 PEOPLE
BECAUSE SOMETHING IN HIM

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:36.064
MADE HIM GO INTO THAT PLANE
WHEN HIS GOOD SENSE

01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:38.066
TOLD HIM OTHERWISE.

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.735
HE SETTLED FOR CREDIT CARDS

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:42.771
WHICH HE SOLD FOR, WHAT,
A COUPLE OF BUCKS?

01:30:42.805 --> 01:30:45.741
GIVE HIM ENOUGH
FOR A DECENT MEAL?

01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:49.244
ALL THIS IS
OFF THE RECORD, CHUCKY.

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:52.681
IF JOHN LIVES,
MR. LaPLANTE IS GOING TO
OFFER HIS ASSURANCES

01:30:52.715 --> 01:30:56.585
THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER
MISBEHAVIOR ON HIS PART

01:30:56.619 --> 01:30:58.120
AND WHAT'S MORE,
HE'LL APOLOGIZE.

01:30:58.153 --> 01:31:00.789
I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE
TO BUBBER?

01:31:00.823 --> 01:31:04.092
I COULD DENY I HAD
THOSE CARDS ON THE PLANE.

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:05.193
LIE, YOU MEAN.

01:31:05.227 --> 01:31:07.930
I'LL TELL IT
LIKE I JUST DID.

01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:11.934
EVERYONE WILL SEE THAT
JOHN IS A BIGGER HERO THAN
THEY THOUGHT.

01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:14.903
YOU ARE THE
LOWEST FUCKING THING
THAT EVER CRAWLED!

01:31:14.937 --> 01:31:17.039
YOUR NAME IS GOING
TO BE SYNONYMOUS

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:18.574
WITH BLACKMAIL.

01:31:18.607 --> 01:31:20.242
I GOT A KID.

01:31:20.275 --> 01:31:22.077
I'M A PERSON,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:31:22.110 --> 01:31:24.046
FOR YOUR CHILD'S
SAKE

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:25.681
TRY TO SHOW SOME DECENCY!

01:31:25.714 --> 01:31:27.816
YOU MAY HAVE KILLED HIM
ALREADY!

01:31:35.591 --> 01:31:36.892
NOT YOU, PAL.

01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:38.594
OFFICER, IT'S OKAY.

01:31:38.627 --> 01:31:40.195
HE BELONGS TO ME.

01:31:43.198 --> 01:31:44.533
GO AWAY, BOYS.

01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:50.138
THAT WAS CHANNEL 4's
GALE GAYELY

01:31:50.172 --> 01:31:53.809
BEING ESCORTED INTO THE HOTEL
BY POLICE OFFICERS.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:57.279
GALE, WHO WAS RESCUED FROM
THE PLANE CRASH BY JOHN BUBBER

01:31:57.312 --> 01:32:01.884
HAS A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE ANGEL OF FLIGHT 104.

01:32:01.917 --> 01:32:04.887
NOW, AS TO WHAT SHE MIGHT
BE DOING HERE

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:07.990
there might be a reason
to be found

01:32:08.023 --> 01:32:10.292
in her wanting
to speak with him.

01:32:10.325 --> 01:32:12.995
HE WILL ONLY TALK
TO YOU, MS. GAYLEY

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:15.163
AND HE WON'T MOVE ANY CLOSER

01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:18.967
SO IF YOU'LL JUST LEAN OUT,
WE'LL HOLD YOU FROM BEHIND.

01:32:19.001 --> 01:32:20.636
FELLOWS, GIVE US SOME ROOM.

01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:22.905
LET HER IN THERE.

01:32:27.075 --> 01:32:28.744
JOHN.

01:32:28.777 --> 01:32:31.213
JOHN, I'M HERE.

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:33.782
DON'T DO IT.

01:32:33.816 --> 01:32:35.350
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.152
GALE.

01:32:41.624 --> 01:32:45.093
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU.

01:32:45.127 --> 01:32:46.962
THIS IS FOR YOU.

01:32:46.995 --> 01:32:48.597
IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.

01:32:51.133 --> 01:32:54.036
JOHN, I KNOW THE WHOLE STORY.

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:55.804
YOU DO?

01:32:56.972 --> 01:32:59.708
JOHN, JOHN, JOHN!

01:32:59.742 --> 01:33:01.710
JOHN, IT'S OKAY.

01:33:01.744 --> 01:33:03.578
IT WAS A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS.

01:33:04.346 --> 01:33:06.615
A LITTLE MISTAKE.

01:33:06.649 --> 01:33:07.750
"A LITTLE MISTAKE"?

01:33:07.783 --> 01:33:09.084
YOU'RE BEING
TOO HARD.

01:33:09.117 --> 01:33:11.219
I HAVE THE LITTLE CREEP
THAT'S TRYING

01:33:11.253 --> 01:33:13.188
TO BLACKMAIL YOU.

01:33:13.221 --> 01:33:15.624
BULLSHIT, HOLD ON.

01:33:16.892 --> 01:33:19.227
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

01:33:19.261 --> 01:33:22.297
I GOT TO TALK TO YOU, BUDDY.

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:24.867
LaPLANTE.
DON'T BE
AN ASSHOLE.

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:26.969
I DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS.

01:33:27.002 --> 01:33:28.804
LaPLANTE, I'M SORRY.

01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:30.806
IT'S ALL IN MY LETTER THERE.

01:33:30.839 --> 01:33:31.907
TURN THAT OFF.

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:33.909
YOU WANT HIM
TO JUMP?

01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:36.411
GET OUT OF HERE,
BOTH OF YOU.

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:40.182
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU,
AND THEN YOU CAN JUMP.

01:33:40.215 --> 01:33:42.718
YOU CAN JUMP TWICE
FOR ALL I CARE.

01:33:42.751 --> 01:33:43.786
TALK FROM THERE.

01:33:43.819 --> 01:33:45.120
IN PRIVATE.

01:33:45.153 --> 01:33:46.321
THEY GOT CAMERAS.

01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:47.956
MICROPHONES.

01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:51.259
There is someone out
on the ledge with Bubber.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:55.097
We can only presume he's
a rescue person of some kind

01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:57.866
from the police
or fire department.

01:33:57.900 --> 01:33:59.902
He is moving...

01:33:59.935 --> 01:34:01.870
He is crawling
toward Bubber.

01:34:01.904 --> 01:34:05.774
He does not have
a safety rope tied to him

01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:08.143
and as we've explained,
the fire department...

01:34:08.176 --> 01:34:10.679
I'M SORRY.
I HAD THE SHOE.

01:34:10.713 --> 01:34:12.114
YOU DIDN'T WANT ANY PUBLICITY.

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:14.850
I DIDN'T SAY
I DIDN'T WANT A MILLION BUCKS.

01:34:14.883 --> 01:34:16.752
I DIDN'T EXPECT THEM
TO GO FOR IT.

01:34:16.785 --> 01:34:18.854
THEY INVESTIGATED
MY WAR RECORD.

01:34:18.887 --> 01:34:21.023
I KEPT EXPECTING YOU
TO EXPOSE ME.

01:34:21.056 --> 01:34:23.458
I WAS IN JAIL,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:26.194
Man:
Everyone, please stand back.

01:34:26.228 --> 01:34:28.030
LaPlante:
WHOA, THIS IS CRAZY.

01:34:28.063 --> 01:34:29.798
WE COULD FALL OFF OF HERE.

01:34:29.832 --> 01:34:31.133
YOU SHOULD GO INSIDE.

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:32.935
YOU'RE RISKING
YOUR LIFE AGAIN.

01:34:32.968 --> 01:34:35.838
I'M BEGINNING TO BE AWARE
OF THAT, JOHN.

01:34:38.774 --> 01:34:41.910
LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING TO DO
NOTHING HEROIC HERE.

01:34:41.944 --> 01:34:44.713
YOU CAN TRUST ME ON THAT,
BUDDY.

01:34:44.747 --> 01:34:48.016
NOW, WHY DON'T WE SIT DOWN
FOR A WHILE?

01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:52.320
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD, LIKE,
REST UP FOR THE JUMP.

01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:54.089
HUH?

01:34:59.795 --> 01:35:02.865
( crowd cheering )

01:35:06.802 --> 01:35:08.771
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

01:35:08.804 --> 01:35:11.239
I WAS DIRT POOR
AND USELESS

01:35:11.273 --> 01:35:13.441
BUT I WAS HONEST.

01:35:13.475 --> 01:35:15.310
OH, LIGHTEN UP, JOHN.

01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:18.046
YOU THINK YOU GOT PROBLEMS,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:35:20.415 --> 01:35:22.851
I'M THE GUY
WITH THE PROBLEMS.

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:35.230
We still don't know
why John Bubber,
hero to the nation

01:35:35.263 --> 01:35:37.432
stepped out onto the ledge

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:40.903
15 stories above the street
more than an hour ago

01:35:40.936 --> 01:35:43.906
but we now have
the identity of the man

01:35:43.939 --> 01:35:47.042
who has been talking to him
for the last 15 minutes

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:48.944
at great personal risk.

01:35:48.977 --> 01:35:51.479
He has been identified
as Bernard LaPlante

01:35:51.513 --> 01:35:53.515
former employee of...

01:35:53.548 --> 01:35:56.318
MOM!

01:35:56.351 --> 01:35:58.153
IT'S MY FATHER!

01:35:58.186 --> 01:35:59.754
BERNIE?

01:36:00.522 --> 01:36:03.558
HE'S ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS?

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:07.095
LaPLANTE, YOU CRAZY BASTARD.

01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:08.396
LaPLANTE?

01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:10.298
...Bernard LaPlante.

01:36:10.332 --> 01:36:12.234
OH!

01:36:12.267 --> 01:36:15.237
I'M GOING TO GET
A HOT OVERHEAD ANGLE.

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:17.572
... at Gumley's
Carpet Care Company.

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:23.211
LaPlante seems to have
persuaded John Bubber
to sit down

01:36:23.245 --> 01:36:27.115
and the two men seem to be
engrossed in conversation.

01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:31.053
What they might be saying
at a moment like this...

01:36:47.970 --> 01:36:50.172
IT IS HIM.

01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:54.276
WHAT'S HE DOING
UP THERE, MOM?

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:55.944
WHERE'S YOUR COAT?

01:36:55.978 --> 01:36:57.612
GET YOUR COAT.

01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:00.582
...IS A GOOD SIGN
SINCE HE HAS NOT JUMPED.

01:37:00.615 --> 01:37:02.550
IF A MAN DOESN'T JUMP
IMMEDIATELY

01:37:02.584 --> 01:37:06.088
THERE IS A CHANCE
THAT HE WON'T JUMP AT ALL.

01:37:06.121 --> 01:37:09.257
...A MAN WHO CLAIMS THAT HE
IS AN EXPERT LIP-READER

01:37:09.291 --> 01:37:11.559
REPORTS THAT JOHN BUBBER
AND BERNARD LaPLANTE

01:37:11.593 --> 01:37:14.997
ARE DISCUSSING RELIGION
AS THEY SIT ON THE LEDGE.

01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:18.266
YOU STOLE HER PURSE
WHILE YOU WERE SAVING HER?

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.135
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:22.437
YOU DECIDED TO PRETEND
YOU WERE ME.

01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:24.272
A LITTLE MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS, RIGHT?

01:37:24.306 --> 01:37:25.874
SO I SWIPED HER PURSE.

01:37:25.908 --> 01:37:28.110
I GOT FEET OF CLAY TOO.

01:37:28.143 --> 01:37:30.545
AND NOW SHE THINKS
YOU'RE BLACKMAILING ME.

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:33.515
SHE DON'T LIKE ME, JOHN,
AND SHE AIN'T ALONE.

01:37:33.548 --> 01:37:36.518
I GUESS IT'S KIND
OF A PERSONALITY THING.

01:37:36.551 --> 01:37:38.553
LOOK AT THOSE MANIACS
DOWN THERE.

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:40.522
THEY LOVE YOU,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:37:40.555 --> 01:37:42.524
I CAN'T FACE
THOSE PEOPLE NOW.

01:37:42.557 --> 01:37:44.192
THE LOOKS IN THEIR EYES

01:37:44.226 --> 01:37:46.194
AFTER THE TRUST
THEY GAVE ME...

01:37:46.228 --> 01:37:48.563
GREAT. YOU MAKE
THIS BIG GODDAMN MESS

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:49.664
AND THEN YOU JUMP.

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:52.067
I WAS THERE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:54.569
I SEEN YOU WITH
THOSE LITTLE BASTARDS.

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:56.271
I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU.

01:37:56.304 --> 01:37:58.540
I'M NOT SAYING
I HATE SICK PEOPLE

01:37:58.573 --> 01:38:00.575
BUT I HATE
BEING AROUND THEM

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:02.377
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:04.579
THERE YOU GO--

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:06.548
YOU INSPIRE THIS KID
TO LIVE.

01:38:06.581 --> 01:38:08.917
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
VOMITED ON HIM.

01:38:08.951 --> 01:38:11.920
ALLEN?
ALLEN'S OKAY?

01:38:11.954 --> 01:38:13.956
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

01:38:13.989 --> 01:38:16.258
YOU REMEMBER HIS NAME,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:19.962
YOU'RE THE GUY THAT GOT
THOSE PEOPLE OUT OF THE PLANE.

01:38:19.995 --> 01:38:21.930
YOU WOULD HAVE
GONE IN THERE.

01:38:21.964 --> 01:38:23.465
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
THOUGHT TWICE.

01:38:23.498 --> 01:38:26.134
THAT'S THE KIND
OF GUY YOU ARE.

01:38:26.168 --> 01:38:27.502
WHAT DO WE DO?

01:38:27.535 --> 01:38:29.504
THE BLACKMAIL THING
DON'T SOUND BAD.

01:38:29.537 --> 01:38:33.508
YOU STILL HAVE SOME
MONEY LEFT, DON'T YOU?

01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:36.211
THERE'S A LOT OF IT LEFT.

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:38.713
THE TV LADY THINKS
I'M BLACKMAILING YOU

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:40.682
BECAUSE YOU SWIPED
HER PURSE.

01:38:40.715 --> 01:38:43.051
SHE THINKS I KNOW
YOU SWIPED IT

01:38:43.085 --> 01:38:44.686
BECAUSE YOU SOLD IT TO ME.

01:38:44.719 --> 01:38:46.688
WHAT SHE DON'T KNOW

01:38:46.721 --> 01:38:49.958
IS THAT I REALLY AM GOING
TO BLACKMAIL YOU

01:38:49.992 --> 01:38:51.693
BECAUSE I SWIPED
HER PURSE

01:38:51.726 --> 01:38:54.062
BECAUSE IT WAS ME
ON THE PLANE.

01:38:54.096 --> 01:38:56.731
YOU WANT ME NOT TO JUMP

01:38:56.764 --> 01:39:00.102
AND KEEP LYING AND PAY YOU
TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

01:39:00.135 --> 01:39:01.669
YOU ARE CRAZY. WHY?

01:39:01.703 --> 01:39:03.638
I DON'T NEED YOUR PROBLEMS--

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:06.374
ALL THIS TV BULLSHIT,
ALL THESE FANS.

01:39:06.408 --> 01:39:08.543
I JUST WANT
SOME OF THE MONEY.

01:39:08.576 --> 01:39:10.512
HERE'S WHAT I GOT IN MIND.

01:39:10.545 --> 01:39:14.082
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT DO I WANT TO KNOW?

01:39:14.116 --> 01:39:15.750
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:17.719
WHO'S THIS SCREWBALL LaPLANTE?

01:39:17.752 --> 01:39:20.422
WHAT ARE THOSE TWO BOZOS
CHATTERING ABOUT?

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:21.556
YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM?

01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:23.358
READ THEIR LIPS.

01:39:23.391 --> 01:39:25.093
YOU'RE A REPORTER--
IMPROVISE.

01:39:25.127 --> 01:39:27.629
THIS IS NOT A NEWS STORY.

01:39:27.662 --> 01:39:30.132
THIS IS REAL LIFE!

01:39:30.165 --> 01:39:31.433
REAL LIFE?

01:39:31.466 --> 01:39:34.569
JESUS CHRIST, GALE,
DON'T CRACK UP ON ME NOW.

01:39:34.602 --> 01:39:36.204
WHY WOULD I?

01:39:36.238 --> 01:39:38.406
I'M A PROFESSIONAL, AREN'T I?

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.676
I'M A CYNICAL, HARD-BITTEN,
PROFESSIONAL HARD-ASS,
AREN'T I?

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:45.213
A COLD, AMBITIOUS BITCH
OR SOMETHING.

01:39:45.247 --> 01:39:47.649
ISN'T THAT
WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS?

01:39:47.682 --> 01:39:50.318
NO, GALE,
YOU ARE NONE OF THOSE THINGS.

01:39:50.352 --> 01:39:52.120
YOU ARE A GODDAMN CREAM PUFF.

01:39:52.154 --> 01:39:54.022
YOU'RE A MARSHMALLOW.

01:39:54.056 --> 01:39:56.024
THAT'S WHY
EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.

01:39:56.058 --> 01:39:58.693
NOW TRY AND BE
A PROFESSIONAL MARSHMALLOW

01:39:58.726 --> 01:40:01.496
AND GET OUT THERE AND REPORT
THE GODDAMN HUMAN DRAMA!

01:40:01.529 --> 01:40:04.066
( crowd chanting: )
BUBBER, BUBBER, BUBBER...

01:40:04.099 --> 01:40:05.700
JOHN!

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:08.403
( sobbing )

01:40:11.606 --> 01:40:13.275
I QUIT, DEAK.

01:40:13.308 --> 01:40:15.177
YOU CAN'T!
IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!

01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:17.679
MAYBE HE'S UP THERE
BECAUSE HE MISSES YOU.

01:40:17.712 --> 01:40:20.682
I WOULDN'T LET HIM SEE YOU
THE OTHER NIGHT.

01:40:20.715 --> 01:40:22.650
OH, GOD,
MAYBE IT'S MY FAULT.

01:40:22.684 --> 01:40:24.752
I THOUGHT
YOU HATED HIM.

01:40:24.786 --> 01:40:26.754
NO. HE JUST
MAKES ME ANGRY.

01:40:26.788 --> 01:40:28.623
HE'S SELFISH AND CYNICAL.

01:40:28.656 --> 01:40:31.159
WHAT'S CYNICAL?

01:40:31.193 --> 01:40:34.829
IT'S WHEN YOU SAY, "EVERYBODY
ELSE CHEATS, WHY SHOULDN'T I?"

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:37.332
BUT HE DOES HAVE HIS GOOD SIDE

01:40:37.365 --> 01:40:39.534
LIKE WHEN YOU WERE
IN THE HOSPITAL

01:40:39.567 --> 01:40:41.569
AND YOU HAD
YOUR APPENDIX OUT.

01:40:41.603 --> 01:40:44.139
HE STAYED WITH YOU
THE WHOLE NIGHT

01:40:44.172 --> 01:40:45.840
AND HE HATES
HOSPITALS.

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:48.543
IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR FATHER'S
AT HIS BEST

01:40:48.576 --> 01:40:50.545
WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS.

01:40:50.578 --> 01:40:52.547
WHEN
SOMETHING GOES REALLY WRONG

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:54.549
OR THERE'S SOME KIND
OF EMERGENCY

01:40:54.582 --> 01:40:57.552
YOUR FATHER... HE JUST FORGETS
TO BE BERNIE LaPLANTE

01:40:57.585 --> 01:41:00.355
AND ACTS SORT OF LIKE
A HUMAN BEING.

01:41:00.388 --> 01:41:03.825
LOOK!
OH, GOD,
WHAT IS IT?

01:41:03.858 --> 01:41:05.593
Something's going on.

01:41:05.627 --> 01:41:08.263
HE SEEMS TO BE CALLING OUT
TO THEM.

01:41:08.296 --> 01:41:10.265
NOW... HE'S HOLDING UP
TWO FINGERS.

01:41:10.298 --> 01:41:12.234
He's signaling something.

01:41:12.267 --> 01:41:14.436
HOLDING UP TWO FINGERS.

01:41:14.469 --> 01:41:16.838
There are firemen
leaning out the window.

01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:18.773
They have long poles.

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:20.842
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:23.345
They're reaching the poles
towards the two men.

01:41:23.378 --> 01:41:25.680
There's something
at the tip of the poles.

01:41:25.713 --> 01:41:27.515
It looks like...

01:41:27.549 --> 01:41:29.651
( horn honking )

01:41:29.684 --> 01:41:33.355
Wait a minute,
I have a report here.

01:41:33.388 --> 01:41:35.490
Coffee.

01:41:35.523 --> 01:41:38.293
We're told that Bubber
and LaPlante asked for coffee.

01:41:38.326 --> 01:41:40.362
IT'S JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER

01:41:40.395 --> 01:41:42.530
TO REQUEST SOMETHING
TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

01:41:42.564 --> 01:41:44.299
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
ARE WATCHING

01:41:44.332 --> 01:41:45.700
AND HE WANTS COFFEE.

01:42:00.415 --> 01:42:04.152
We have just learned that
LaPlante is a convicted felon

01:42:04.186 --> 01:42:07.389
due to be sentenced tomorrow
for trafficking
in stolen goods.

01:42:07.422 --> 01:42:09.724
GALE SHOULD HAVE AIRED
THAT BIT FIRST.

01:42:09.757 --> 01:42:12.927
SHE'S THE ONE WHO FOUND
THIS CLOWN LaPLANTE.

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.298
SHE LET CHANNEL 8
GET A BEAT ON US.

01:42:16.331 --> 01:42:19.334
DEAK, WHAT IF BUBBER
HAS GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE?

01:42:19.367 --> 01:42:21.736
WHAT IF HE'S THE WRONG GUY?

01:42:21.769 --> 01:42:24.306
HELL OF A STORY.

01:42:24.339 --> 01:42:27.242
NO, DEAK, THAT IS NOT
A GOOD STORY.

01:42:27.275 --> 01:42:28.843
WE BACKED THIS GUY.

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:30.378
HE'S OUR BOY.

01:42:30.412 --> 01:42:32.514
WE GAVE HIM
A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

01:42:32.547 --> 01:42:34.649
WE GAVE HIM
A MILLION DOLLARS.

01:42:34.682 --> 01:42:35.883
YOU GOT IT?

01:42:35.917 --> 01:42:38.553
FOUR-YEAR SCHOLARSHIP
TO A TOP COLLEGE

01:42:38.586 --> 01:42:40.555
PLUS MEDICAL SCHOOL
OR LAW SCHOOL

01:42:40.588 --> 01:42:42.424
OR WHATEVER JOEY WANTS.

01:42:42.457 --> 01:42:45.427
PAY OFF MY ATTORNEY, PLUS
MY ANNUAL CONSULTING FEE...

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:48.863
...PLUS GIVING A DEPOSITION
TO THE JUDGE ON YOUR BEHALF.

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:51.666
IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

01:42:51.699 --> 01:42:53.635
A TESTIMONIAL
FROM JOHN BUBBER--

01:42:53.668 --> 01:42:55.803
YOU THINK HE WON'T
SUSPEND MY SENTENCE

01:42:55.837 --> 01:42:57.905
FOR THE ANGEL OF FLIGHT 104?

01:42:57.939 --> 01:42:59.774
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

01:42:59.807 --> 01:43:02.544
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
DECEIVING PEOPLE.

01:43:02.577 --> 01:43:04.679
YOU TOOK MY SHOE,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:43:04.712 --> 01:43:06.681
WHY SHOULD YOU
BE COMFORTABLE?

01:43:06.714 --> 01:43:08.650
UNCOMFORTABLE
IS HOW YOU SHOULD BE.

01:43:08.683 --> 01:43:10.318
BESIDES

01:43:10.352 --> 01:43:13.321
HOW COMFORTABLE
WILL YOU FEEL IF YOU JUMP

01:43:13.355 --> 01:43:14.789
BREAKING THE HEARTS
OF MILLIONS

01:43:14.822 --> 01:43:17.359
AND LEAVING BERNIE LaPLANTE
VOMITING ON KIDS

01:43:17.392 --> 01:43:18.793
INSTEAD OF INSPIRING THEM?

01:43:18.826 --> 01:43:21.496
YOU THINK I'D GIVE A CENT
TO CHARITY?

01:43:21.529 --> 01:43:23.531
GIVE DONATIONS
TO THE HOMELESS?

01:43:23.565 --> 01:43:24.966
I'M NOT A NICE GUY.

01:43:24.999 --> 01:43:27.235
YOU'RE THE NICE GUY.

01:43:27.269 --> 01:43:28.836
NOW DO YOUR JOB.

01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:30.705
BE A HERO.

01:43:30.738 --> 01:43:32.440
BETTER GET RID
OF YOUR CONFESSION.

01:43:32.474 --> 01:43:34.376
WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT

01:43:34.409 --> 01:43:36.010
WITH ME RECEIVING
ALL THE CREDIT?

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:37.645
I DON'T TAKE CREDIT.

01:43:37.679 --> 01:43:39.681
I'M A CASH KIND OF GUY.

01:43:39.714 --> 01:43:41.449
WE GOT A DEAL?

01:43:41.483 --> 01:43:43.885
YOU SURE
WE CAN PULL THIS OFF?

01:43:43.918 --> 01:43:45.853
JOHN, YOU'RE SITTING
ON A LEDGE

01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:47.889
ABOUT TO JUMP
TO YOUR DOOM.

01:43:47.922 --> 01:43:49.957
I'M ABOUT TO GO TO PRISON.

01:43:49.991 --> 01:43:52.460
WHAT EXACTLY
HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE?

01:43:58.866 --> 01:44:01.303
( crowd cheering )

01:44:01.336 --> 01:44:03.471
Conklin:
THEY'RE GETTING TO THEIR FEET.

01:44:03.505 --> 01:44:05.307
CAREFULLY.

01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:08.943
YOU CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT
IN THE CROWD.

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:11.779
JOHN BUBBER IS STANDING
AND IS HELPING HIS COMPANION.

01:44:11.813 --> 01:44:14.316
A MISSTEP,
AND THEY COULD PLUMMET 15...

01:44:15.983 --> 01:44:17.452
AFTER WHAT I DID

01:44:17.485 --> 01:44:19.954
HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOU CAN TRUST ME?

01:44:19.987 --> 01:44:21.489
'CAUSE BOTTOM LINE, JOHN

01:44:21.523 --> 01:44:24.559
I AIN'T NO DIFFERENT
THAN ALL THOSE ASSHOLES.

01:44:24.592 --> 01:44:26.060
WE ALL TRUST YOU

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:27.829
FOR...

01:44:27.862 --> 01:44:29.597
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:44:29.631 --> 01:44:31.299
WE...

01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:39.741
THAT WAS REALLY DUMB

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:42.310
COMING OUT HERE
ON THIS LEDGE.

01:44:45.079 --> 01:44:47.315
OH, MY GOD, BERNIE.

01:44:53.888 --> 01:44:55.590
( wood creaking )

01:44:55.623 --> 01:44:56.658
WHOA!

01:44:56.691 --> 01:44:58.092
( crowd screaming )

01:44:58.125 --> 01:45:00.728
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

01:45:00.762 --> 01:45:01.796
Gayley:
SAVE HIM!

01:45:01.829 --> 01:45:03.331
DON'T GRAB HIM, DON'T!

01:45:03.365 --> 01:45:04.899
NO, GRAB HIM!

01:45:04.932 --> 01:45:07.702
YES, GRAB HIM!

01:45:07.735 --> 01:45:09.003
GRAB THIS.

01:45:09.036 --> 01:45:10.372
YOU CAN'T HELP HIM.

01:45:10.405 --> 01:45:11.906
HE'LL PULL YOU OVER.

01:45:17.445 --> 01:45:19.481
NO! NEVER REACH OUT!

01:45:22.917 --> 01:45:28.823
Chorus:
* GLORY, GLORY HALLELUJAH

01:45:28.856 --> 01:45:34.596
* GLORY, GLORY HALLELUJAH

01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:35.963
TAKE THE LINE.

01:45:35.997 --> 01:45:37.098
PUT IT AROUND HIM.

01:45:37.131 --> 01:45:38.933
HE'LL PULL YOU OFF.

01:45:38.966 --> 01:45:41.569
IF HE GOES, I GO.
YOU GOT THAT?

01:45:41.603 --> 01:45:43.605
HE'LL PULL YOU OFF!
DO IT!

01:45:43.638 --> 01:45:45.973
YES, SIR. I GOT IT.

01:45:48.476 --> 01:45:53.681
* GLORY, GLORY HALLELUJAH.

01:45:54.882 --> 01:45:57.018
ZOOMING IN TIGHTER YET

01:45:57.051 --> 01:45:59.887
HE CAPTURES THE STARK DRAMA
AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK.

01:45:59.921 --> 01:46:02.089
WAS I AFRAID?

01:46:02.123 --> 01:46:05.793
WELL, AT MOMENTS LIKE THAT
YOU DON'T THINK
ABOUT YOURSELF.

01:46:05.827 --> 01:46:07.762
YOU THINK ABOUT THE FOCUS.

01:46:07.795 --> 01:46:09.797
YOU THINK ABOUT F-STOP.

01:46:09.831 --> 01:46:12.133
YOU THINK ABOUT THE 11:00 NEWS

01:46:12.166 --> 01:46:14.402
EVERYBODY COUNTING ON YOU.

01:46:15.570 --> 01:46:17.539
LOOKING GOOD, PARTNER.

01:46:17.572 --> 01:46:19.173
HANG IN THERE.

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:21.609
YOU'RE A GODDAMN SAINT,
JOHN.

01:46:24.679 --> 01:46:27.482
PARDON THE VULGARITY.

01:46:27.515 --> 01:46:31.152
WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT I SAVED
BERNARD LaPLANTE'S LIFE
JUST NOW

01:46:31.185 --> 01:46:33.154
BUT I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT

01:46:33.187 --> 01:46:36.123
IF HE HADN'T
SAVED MY LIFE FIRST.

01:46:36.157 --> 01:46:38.159
YOU SEE, I HAD A...

01:46:38.192 --> 01:46:41.028
I HAD A TERRIBLE MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS

01:46:41.062 --> 01:46:42.997
AND I WAS FEELING...

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:46.734
I GUESS YOU'D CALL IT
OVERWHELMED BY THE PRESSURES

01:46:46.768 --> 01:46:50.004
OF FAME AND CELEBRITY.

01:46:50.037 --> 01:46:52.940
I DIDN'T FEEL, UH,
QUITE ADEQUATE.

01:46:54.609 --> 01:46:57.579
I WASN'T MEASURING UP
TO PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS

01:46:57.612 --> 01:46:59.781
OF MY IMAGE

01:46:59.814 --> 01:47:04.452
and I was going to take
that despair out on the ledge

01:47:04.486 --> 01:47:05.587
with the intention...

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:07.589
HOW DID YOU
GET IN HERE?

01:47:07.622 --> 01:47:09.156
I SNUCK IN.

01:47:09.190 --> 01:47:10.825
THIS IS PRIVATE HERE.

01:47:10.858 --> 01:47:12.159
NO MEDIA.

01:47:12.193 --> 01:47:13.861
WAS IT YOU?

01:47:13.895 --> 01:47:15.630
ON THE PLANE
WHO SAVED MY LIFE?

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:17.565
LOOK, LADY

01:47:19.567 --> 01:47:20.935
I DON'T GIVE
NO INTERVIEWS.

01:47:20.968 --> 01:47:22.937
I GOT AN ATTORNEY.

01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:26.641
YOU GOT ANY QUESTIONS,
YOU COULD TALK TO HER.

01:47:26.674 --> 01:47:27.942
MR. LaPLANTE... BERNIE

01:47:27.975 --> 01:47:31.045
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
LIKE A HUMAN BEING

01:47:31.078 --> 01:47:33.047
NOT A REPORTER.

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:36.250
I'M SOMEBODY WHO WAS GOING
TO DIE IN A BURNING PLANE

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:39.120
AND I LOOKED UP
AND THIS MAN CAME OUT

01:47:39.153 --> 01:47:40.888
OF THE SMOKE

01:47:40.922 --> 01:47:43.224
HIS FACE COVERED
WITH MUD AND SOOT

01:47:43.257 --> 01:47:45.092
AND HE SAVED MY LIFE.

01:47:45.126 --> 01:47:48.062
OFF THE RECORD...
WAS IT YOU?

01:47:48.095 --> 01:47:49.230
OFF THE RECORD--

01:47:49.263 --> 01:47:51.165
WHAT'S THAT, LIKE, TIME OUT?

01:47:52.567 --> 01:47:54.736
IT JUST MEANS IT'S BETWEEN US.

01:47:54.769 --> 01:47:56.971
DOESN'T LEAVE THE ROOM.

01:48:10.652 --> 01:48:14.255
LADY, DO I LOOK DUMB ENOUGH
TO RUN INTO A BURNING PLANE

01:48:14.288 --> 01:48:16.624
AND SAVE A BUNCH OF STRANGERS?

01:48:16.658 --> 01:48:18.626
I AIN'T THE TYPE.

01:48:27.068 --> 01:48:28.803
RIGHT.

01:48:31.105 --> 01:48:33.775
We're here in the lobby
with Evelyn LaPlante

01:48:33.808 --> 01:48:35.777
who says she
is the wife

01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:37.612
of Bernie LaPlante...

01:48:37.645 --> 01:48:40.948
OH, JESUS CHRIST ALL MIGHTY.

01:48:40.982 --> 01:48:42.950
...who was rescued
by John Bubber.

01:48:42.984 --> 01:48:45.953
Mrs. LaPlante has just told me
that Bernard LaPlante

01:48:45.987 --> 01:48:49.991
spoke to her earlier today
about going away
on a long trip

01:48:50.024 --> 01:48:52.627
and wanting to say good-bye

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:56.698
to his ten-year-old son, Joey.

01:48:56.731 --> 01:48:59.233
I didn't know Bernie would try

01:48:59.266 --> 01:49:01.168
to jump off a building.

01:49:01.202 --> 01:49:04.205
I just thought he was up
to his old...

01:49:04.238 --> 01:49:05.773
THERE YOU GO, TV.

01:49:05.807 --> 01:49:07.208
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ONE WORD

01:49:07.241 --> 01:49:09.310
YOU HEAR ON TV.

01:49:09.343 --> 01:49:14.215
Bernard LaPlante is
a decent, wonderful human
being deep down.

01:49:14.248 --> 01:49:16.584
IT'S ALL BULLSHIT.

01:49:16.618 --> 01:49:18.119
You have to know him.

01:49:18.152 --> 01:49:20.054
You love your father?

01:49:20.087 --> 01:49:21.789
LEAVE MY BOY ALONE.

01:49:21.823 --> 01:49:24.225
My dad's great.

01:49:24.258 --> 01:49:27.962
How did you feel, Joey,
seeing your dad on that ledge?

01:49:27.995 --> 01:49:31.733
I was scared, but I...

01:49:31.766 --> 01:49:33.801
But what, son?

01:49:33.835 --> 01:49:36.604
But I knew John Bubber
would save him.

01:49:42.043 --> 01:49:45.980
I THINK YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
TELL YOUR SON
ABOUT HIS FATHER.

01:49:59.093 --> 01:50:00.895
OFF THE RECORD

01:50:00.928 --> 01:50:03.698
THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

01:50:05.099 --> 01:50:06.701
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:50:15.677 --> 01:50:18.179
...AN ORGANIZATION DESIGNED
TO HELP THE NEEDY...

01:50:18.212 --> 01:50:22.684
...THE HOMELESS,
VETERANS, ELDERLY.

01:50:24.919 --> 01:50:27.421
WE'RE EVEN FUNDING A GROUP
FOR THE PROTECTION

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:29.056
OF SMALL ANIMALS.

01:50:31.125 --> 01:50:32.359
MR. BUBBER.

01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:34.796
MR. BUBBER.

01:50:34.829 --> 01:50:36.297
HELLO, MS. GAYLEY.

01:50:36.330 --> 01:50:38.332
YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR ME?

01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:41.703
EVERYONE THINKS OF YOU
AS A HERO, MR. BUBBER.

01:50:41.736 --> 01:50:43.838
HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF?

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:47.975
I THINK WE'RE ALL HEROES

01:50:48.009 --> 01:50:50.411
IF YOU CATCH US
AT THE RIGHT MOMENT.

01:50:50.444 --> 01:50:52.279
WE ALL HAVE SOMETHING

01:50:52.313 --> 01:50:55.449
NOBLE AND DECENT IN US
TRYING TO GET OUT

01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:58.786
AND WE'RE ALL LESS THAN HEROIC
AT OTHER TIMES.

01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:01.455
It's the media that notices

01:51:01.488 --> 01:51:05.026
one person one moment

01:51:05.059 --> 01:51:06.160
and not another.

01:51:08.095 --> 01:51:12.266
I'm just like the next person-
full of frailty

01:51:12.299 --> 01:51:17.805
with some courage,
some decency, mixed in.

01:51:17.839 --> 01:51:20.141
You think I'm a hero.

01:51:20.174 --> 01:51:23.778
To me, a hero is just a symbol
of what's good in all of us.

01:51:23.811 --> 01:51:26.213
You're looking at me

01:51:26.247 --> 01:51:30.484
and maybe you just notice
what's good in yourself.

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:32.353
WHAT A CROCK OF SHIT.

01:51:32.386 --> 01:51:35.356
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
MORE BULLSHIT OR DRIVEL

01:51:35.389 --> 01:51:38.025
COMING FROM SOMEBODY
WHO'S NOT EVEN THE PRESIDENT?

01:51:38.059 --> 01:51:39.160
IT'S NOT UNTHINKABLE.

01:51:39.193 --> 01:51:40.795
WHAT?

01:51:40.828 --> 01:51:42.396
THE PRESIDENCY--
THE PUBLIC LOVES HIM.

01:51:45.099 --> 01:51:46.367
REMEMBER WHERE
I SAID

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.069
I WAS GOING
TO EXPLAIN

01:51:48.102 --> 01:51:49.370
ABOUT LIFE, BUDDY?

01:51:49.403 --> 01:51:51.072
THE THING
ABOUT LIFE IS

01:51:51.105 --> 01:51:52.439
IT GETS WEIRD.

01:51:52.473 --> 01:51:54.809
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT TRUTH

01:51:54.842 --> 01:51:56.778
LIKE IT'S TOILET PAPER
OR SOMETHING

01:51:56.811 --> 01:51:59.246
AND THEY GOT A SUPPLY
IN THE CLOSET.

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.282
WHAT YOU LEARN
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER

01:52:01.315 --> 01:52:02.917
IS THERE AIN'T NO TRUTH.

01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:04.919
ALL THERE IS
IS BULLSHIT--

01:52:04.952 --> 01:52:06.387
PARDON MY VULGARITY--

01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:08.122
LAYERS OF IT.

01:52:08.155 --> 01:52:10.391
ONE LAYER OF BULLSHIT
ON TOP OF ANOTHER

01:52:10.424 --> 01:52:12.794
AND WHAT YOU DO IN LIFE

01:52:12.827 --> 01:52:15.797
IS YOU PICK THE LAYER
OF BULLSHIT YOU PREFER

01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:17.932
AND THAT'S YOUR BULLSHIT,
SO TO SPEAK.

01:52:17.965 --> 01:52:19.366
YOU GOT THAT?

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:20.434
NO.

01:52:20.467 --> 01:52:21.969
IT'S COMPLICATED.

01:52:22.003 --> 01:52:24.205
MAYBE WHEN YOU GO
TO COLLEGE...

01:52:24.238 --> 01:52:26.007
YOU'RE GOING
TO COLLEGE, RIGHT?

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.975
I GOT IT ALL FIXED UP.

01:52:28.009 --> 01:52:29.476
YOUR MOM AND I
WANT YOU TO GO.

01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:31.212
NOW, LISTEN, JOEY.

01:52:31.245 --> 01:52:35.316
WHAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU NOW
IS OFF THE RECORD.

01:52:35.349 --> 01:52:38.519
STRICT CONFIDENCE, RIGHT?

01:52:38.552 --> 01:52:40.054
REMEMBER THAT NIGHT

01:52:40.087 --> 01:52:43.490
IT WAS RAINING
LIKE A SON OF A BITCH--

01:52:43.524 --> 01:52:45.492
THE NIGHT OF THE PLANE CRASH

01:52:45.526 --> 01:52:48.796
WHERE YOU SEEN ON TV WHERE
BUBBER SAVED THOSE PEOPLE?

01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:50.131
THE THING ABOUT TV IS

01:52:50.164 --> 01:52:53.167
YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE
WHAT YOU SEE--

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.568
NOT IF YOU'RE SMART.

01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:56.570
NOW, WHAT REALLY HAPPENED...

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:59.907
( playing "Auld Lang Syne" )

01:53:10.284 --> 01:53:12.253
...AND THAT'S WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED.

01:53:12.286 --> 01:53:13.855
WOW!

01:53:13.888 --> 01:53:16.257
BUT YOU ALWAYS SAID
KEEP A LOW PROFILE.

01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:17.591
RIGHT.

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:19.927
YOU SAID NEVER
STICK YOUR NECK OUT.

01:53:19.961 --> 01:53:21.228
RIGHT.

01:53:21.262 --> 01:53:24.098
WELL, HOW COULD YOU
GO IN A BURNING PLANE

01:53:24.131 --> 01:53:26.100
AND SAVE 54 PEOPLE?

01:53:26.133 --> 01:53:28.035
WELL, I SCREWED UP.

01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:29.937
( woman screaming )

01:53:29.971 --> 01:53:32.406
Woman:
MY DAUGHTER FELL
IN THE LION'S CAGE!

01:53:32.439 --> 01:53:33.941
CALL THE ZOO KEEPER.

01:53:33.975 --> 01:53:36.210
HEY, SOMEBODY CALL
THE ZOO KEEPER

01:53:36.243 --> 01:53:38.212
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:53:38.245 --> 01:53:42.183
Woman:

FELL IN THE LION'S CAGE!

01:53:42.216 --> 01:53:43.885

01:53:43.918 --> 01:53:47.354
OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:51.458
