[Telephone ringing]

00:39.340 --> 00:41.675
[Ringing continues]

00:58.063 --> 01:00.551
Hello.

01:00.624 --> 01:02.894
What?

01:02.960 --> 01:06.222
No, I don't work today.

01:06.289 --> 01:08.428
I'm playing hockey at 2:00.

01:10.866 --> 01:13.834
Why don't you call Randal?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.395
'Cause I'm fuckin' tired!

01:18.067 --> 01:21.198
I just closed last night.

01:21.268 --> 01:23.123
Jesus.

01:23.188 --> 01:26.320
What time do you think
you're gonna come in, 12:00?

01:28.341 --> 01:31.058
Be there by 12:00? Where?

01:31.125 --> 01:34.509
Swear you'll be there by 12:00
and I'll do it.

01:34.582 --> 01:36.972
12:00, or I walk.

01:45.176 --> 01:47.511
[Slurping]

02:12.861 --> 02:16.636
# It's a meaningless end
To the story

02:16.701 --> 02:20.761
# Got no time
For the forgotten glory

02:20.830 --> 02:24.627
# And now just
When I know what I'm after

02:24.703 --> 02:28.501
# It just brings me to laughter

02:28.576 --> 02:32.286
- # Just save up all your nickels and dimes
- [engine starts]

02:32.352 --> 02:36.925
- # Let's see what you find and you know
- [tires screeching]

02:36.994 --> 02:41.086
# I guess I'm livin' day to day

02:41.154 --> 02:45.562
# Just in case you feel
Led astray, hell, yeah

02:45.635 --> 02:51.965
# I guess I'm livin' day to day
Hear what I say, yeah

02:52.036 --> 02:56.063
# Just save up
All your nickels and dimes

02:56.133 --> 02:59.963
# Let's see what you find
and you know

03:08.007 --> 03:11.303
# I'd just die for a piece
Of that pie but

03:11.367 --> 03:15.678
# I'll be glad to just feast
On that pie crust

03:15.753 --> 03:19.365
# And now just
When I know what I'm after

03:19.433 --> 03:22.816
- # It just brings me to laughter
- Shit!

03:22.889 --> 03:27.167
# Just save up
All your nickels and dimes

03:27.242 --> 03:32.065
# Let's see what you find
And you know

03:32.139 --> 03:35.914
# I guess I'm livin' day to day

03:35.979 --> 03:40.388
# Just so glad to be led astray
Hell, yeah

03:40.461 --> 03:42.982
# I guess I'm livin' day to day

03:43.053 --> 03:45.355
# Hear what I say

03:45.422 --> 03:47.811
# Well

04:17.971 --> 04:22.096
# It's a meaningless end
To the story

04:22.165 --> 04:25.940
# Got no time
For the forgotten glory

04:26.005 --> 04:29.618
# And now just
When I know what I'm after

04:29.686 --> 04:33.997
# It just brings me to laughter

04:34.070 --> 04:37.999
# Just save up
All your nickels and dimes

04:38.071 --> 04:42.415
# Let's see what you find
And you know

04:42.488 --> 04:46.263
# I guess I'm livin' day to day

04:46.328 --> 04:50.802
# Just hopin' to be led astray
Hell, yeah

04:50.873 --> 04:53.295
# I guess I'm livin' day to day

04:53.370 --> 04:56.818
# Hear what I say
Oh, yeah

04:56.890 --> 04:59.858
- # Ooh- hoo #
- Thanks. Have a good one.

04:59.931 --> 05:02.168
- Do you mind if I drink this here?
- Go ahead.

05:02.236 --> 05:04.091
- You open?
- Yeah.

05:05.532 --> 05:08.020
- Pack of cigarettes.
- Are you sure?

05:08.093 --> 05:10.264
- Am I sure?
- Are you sure?

05:10.333 --> 05:13.300
- About what?
- Do you really wanna buy those?

05:13.373 --> 05:15.861
- Are you serious?
- How long you been smoking?

05:15.934 --> 05:18.586
- What is this, a poll?
- How long you been a smoker?

05:18.655 --> 05:21.241
I don't know.
Since I was about 13.

05:21.311 --> 05:24.279
Thirteen.
Let's see, you're about 19, 20?

05:24.351 --> 05:27.581
- Am I right?
- What in the hell is that?

05:27.648 --> 05:31.959
That's your lung.
By this time, your lung looks like this.

05:32.033 --> 05:35.165
- You've gotta be shitting me.
- You think I'm shitting you?

05:35.234 --> 05:37.568
- Here.
- What's this?

05:37.634 --> 05:39.063
A trach ring.

05:39.138 --> 05:42.204
They install it in your throat
when cancer takes your voice box.

05:42.274 --> 05:45.570
- This one came out of a 60-year-old man.
- Oh, God!

05:45.635 --> 05:48.124
He smoked until the day he died.

05:48.196 --> 05:50.465
He used to put the cigarette
in and smoke that way.

05:50.532 --> 05:52.834
- Excuse me, but...
- This is where you're heading.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.487
Cruddy lung, smoking through
a hole in your throat.

05:55.557 --> 05:58.208
- Do you want that?
- If it's already too late, I guess...

05:58.278 --> 06:02.981
No, it's never too late. Put the cigarettes
back, and try some gum instead.

06:03.046 --> 06:05.894
- Here. Chewlies gum. Try this.
- It's not the same.

06:05.959 --> 06:09.255
It's cheaper than cigarettes,
and it certainly beats this.

06:09.319 --> 06:12.833
- Oh, Jesus!
- It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung.

06:12.904 --> 06:14.846
Keep it.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.670
- I'll just take the gum.
- Fifty five.

06:17.737 --> 06:20.705
You made a very wise choice.
Keep up the good work.

06:23.178 --> 06:26.790
If you're gonna drink that coffee,
I think you oughta take it outside.

06:26.859 --> 06:30.754
- I think I'll drink it in here. Thanks.
- If you're gonna drink it here,

06:30.828 --> 06:33.195
I'd appreciate it if you don't bother
the customers.

06:33.259 --> 06:36.555
Okay.
I'm sorry about that.

06:37.741 --> 06:41.833
- Pack of cigarettes. What's that?
- This?

06:41.901 --> 06:44.268
How long you been smoking?

06:47.406 --> 06:50.789
# Kill the drummer

06:50.863 --> 06:55.752
# Kill the bass player
Kill both bass players

06:55.824 --> 06:59.272
# This song is the reason
Why I'm now going deaf #

06:59.344 --> 07:03.120
Let's kick some ass! Yeah!

07:10.066 --> 07:12.816
I feel good today, Silent Bob.
We're gonna make some money.

07:12.883 --> 07:15.698
Know what we're gonna do?
Go to that party and get some pussy.

07:15.763 --> 07:21.776
I'm gonna fuck this bitch.
I'll fuck anything that moves!

07:21.845 --> 07:24.333
What the fuck you lookin' at?
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

07:24.405 --> 07:27.536
Shit, yeah. Don't that motherfucker
owe me ten bucks?

07:27.606 --> 07:31.862
Tonight we're going to rip off
this fucker's head, take out his fuckin' soul.

07:31.926 --> 07:35.701
Remind me if he tries to buy something.
I'm gonna shit in the motherfucker's bag.

07:35.767 --> 07:39.859
- [Girl laughing]
- What's up, baby? What's up, sluts?

07:39.928 --> 07:42.962
Yeah. So, Bob, you're a rude
motherfucker, you know that?

07:43.033 --> 07:46.262
You're cute as hell.
I could go down on you, suck you,

07:46.328 --> 07:49.296
line up three other guys,
make like a circus seal.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.337
Hey, you fucking faggot?
I hate guys.

07:52.410 --> 07:54.647
I love women!

07:54.715 --> 07:56.570
What you want, Grizzly Adams?

07:57.371 --> 08:01.300
You're spending what, 20, maybe 30
dollars a week on your cigarettes?

08:01.403 --> 08:03.378
- Forty.
- Fifty three.

08:03.452 --> 08:06.420
Fifty three dollars a week
on cigarettes! Come on!

08:06.492 --> 08:08.980
Would you give somebody
that much each week to kill you?

08:09.053 --> 08:13.080
That's what you're doing now by paying
for this so called privilege to smoke!

08:13.150 --> 08:15.092
We're gonna croak sometime.

08:15.166 --> 08:19.477
It's that mentality that allows
the cancer producing industry to thrive.

08:19.551 --> 08:23.480
Of course we're all gonna die someday!
Do we have to pay for it?

08:23.552 --> 08:26.367
Do we have to throw hard earned
dollars on the counter...

08:26.432 --> 08:29.247
and say, "Please, Mr. Merchant of Death,
sir, please,

08:29.313 --> 08:32.280
"sell me something that will
stink up my breath and clothes,

08:32.352 --> 08:35.256
- and fry my lungs!"
- [Dante] Now, wait a second.

08:35.330 --> 08:39.105
Here comes the speech about how he's
just doing his job by following orders.

08:39.171 --> 08:42.847
Let me tell you about another group
of hate mongers who followed orders.

08:42.914 --> 08:45.250
- Who's that?
- They were called Nazis!

08:45.315 --> 08:47.039
- That's right.
- Friggin' Nazi.

08:47.108 --> 08:49.564
They practically wiped
an entire nation off the Earth,

08:49.637 --> 08:51.492
like your cigarettes are doing now!

08:51.557 --> 08:54.689
- [Dante] I think you'd oughta leave.
- You want me to leave. Why?

08:54.757 --> 08:59.013
'Cause somebody's telling it like it is,
giving these fine people a wake up call?

08:59.942 --> 09:02.277
No, you're loitering
and causing a disturbance.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.928
I'm a disturbance?
You're the disturbance, pal.

09:04.999 --> 09:09.190
Here, now I am a customer.
I'm gonna buy some Chewlies gum.

09:09.256 --> 09:12.705
I'm a customer engaged in a discussion
with the other customers.

09:12.777 --> 09:15.428
- That's right.
- Smoke my big fat cock!

09:15.497 --> 09:19.109
He's scared now
'cause he sees the threat we present.

09:19.177 --> 09:21.763
He smells the change is coming!

09:21.834 --> 09:25.381
You are the source in this area,
and we're gonna shut you down for good!

09:25.451 --> 09:27.306
For good, cancer merchant!

09:27.371 --> 09:30.022
[Chanting]
Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant!

09:34.700 --> 09:36.773
Who's leading this mob?

09:36.845 --> 09:39.846
[Coughing]
That guy.

09:39.918 --> 09:42.154
- [Coughing continues]
- [Woman] Freeze!

09:48.143 --> 09:51.439
Let's see some credentials.
Slowly!

09:54.544 --> 09:57.195
- You're a Chewlies gum representative?
- [Man] Chewlies?

09:57.265 --> 10:01.673
You're stirring up anti-smoking
sentiment to, what, sell more gum?

10:01.745 --> 10:03.917
Get out of here!

10:04.786 --> 10:08.562
And you people, don't you have jobs
to go to? Get out of here. Go commute.

10:08.627 --> 10:12.402
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
A bunch of easily led automatons.

10:12.468 --> 10:16.396
Try thinking for yourselves before you
pelt an innocent man with cigarettes!

10:16.468 --> 10:21.041
[Coughing, clears throat]

10:21.109 --> 10:23.597
Uh, pack of cigarettes?

10:32.055 --> 10:34.128
Don't you think you're taking
this too hard?

10:34.263 --> 10:38.966
I have enough indignities in my life and
people start throwing cigarettes at me.

10:39.032 --> 10:41.847
- At least they weren't lit.
- I hate this fucking place.

10:41.912 --> 10:44.247
Then quit.
You should be going to school anyway.

10:44.313 --> 10:46.485
Veronica, the last thing I need is a lecture.

10:46.553 --> 10:49.368
All I'm saying is, if you're
that unhappy, you should leave.

10:49.434 --> 10:52.249
- I'm not even supposed to be here today!
- I know.

10:52.314 --> 10:55.282
I stopped by your house.
Your mom told me you left, at 6:00.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.006
The guy got sick.
He couldn't come in.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.726
- Don't you have a hockey game at 2:00?
- Yes.

11:00.796 --> 11:03.927
I'm gonna play like shit because
I didn't have a good night's sleep.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.485
- Why'd you agree to come in?
- I'm only here until 12:00.

11:06.557 --> 11:08.662
After that, I'm gone.
The boss comes in.

11:08.733 --> 11:12.509
- Why don't you open the shutters?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

11:12.574 --> 11:15.444
- You're kidding.
- Bunch of savages in this town.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.023
- Thanks.
- How much did you leave up there?

11:24.096 --> 11:26.966
Three dollars in mixed change
and a couple of singles.

11:27.041 --> 11:29.791
This time in the morning,
people just get a paper or coffee.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.345
- You're trusting.
- Why do you say that?

11:32.418 --> 11:36.248
How do you know they're taking the right
change or paying for what they take?

11:36.322 --> 11:38.908
Theoretically, people see money,
no one around,

11:38.979 --> 11:40.834
they think they're being watched.

11:40.899 --> 11:42.907
Honesty through paranoia.

11:42.980 --> 11:44.987
Why do you smell like shoe polish?

11:45.059 --> 11:47.394
I needed shoe polish
to make that sign out there.

11:47.460 --> 11:50.428
- Smell won't come off.
- [Door opens]

11:50.501 --> 11:52.803
You think anybody
can see us down here?

11:52.869 --> 11:54.757
Why, you wanna have sex or something?

11:54.821 --> 11:56.829
- Can we?
- Really?

11:56.902 --> 11:59.870
- I was kidding.
- Like you can't get enough of me.

11:59.943 --> 12:03.172
- Typically male point of view.
- How do you figure?

12:03.239 --> 12:06.371
Show some bedroom proficiency,
you think you're gods.

12:06.439 --> 12:08.611
- What about what we do for you?
- Women?

12:08.680 --> 12:11.747
Women as lovers are basically the same.
They just have to be there.

12:11.817 --> 12:12.817
Be there?

12:12.873 --> 12:15.491
Making a male climax
isn't at all challenging.

12:15.561 --> 12:19.337
Insert somewhere close,
preferably moist, thrust, repeat.

12:19.402 --> 12:21.257
How flattering.

12:21.322 --> 12:24.138
Now, making a woman come,
therein lies a challenge.

12:24.203 --> 12:25.697
You think so?

12:25.836 --> 12:28.706
A woman makes a guy come,
it's standard.

12:28.779 --> 12:31.235
A guy makes a woman come,
it's talent.

12:31.308 --> 12:33.894
- And I actually date you?
- Something wrong?

12:33.965 --> 12:38.221
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it
takes more than that to get a guy off.

12:38.285 --> 12:40.936
Just being there, as you put it,
is not enough.

12:41.006 --> 12:42.315
I've touched a nerve.

12:42.382 --> 12:45.230
I'm astonished to hear you
trivialize my role in our sex life.

12:45.295 --> 12:47.816
It wasn't directed at you.
It's a broad generalization.

12:47.887 --> 12:50.222
You're making a generalization
about broads.

12:50.288 --> 12:52.263
Those are my opinions
based on the few women

12:52.336 --> 12:54.540
who were goodly enough
to sleep with me.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.616
- How many?
- How many what?

12:56.689 --> 12:59.275
How many different girls
have you slept with?

12:59.345 --> 13:01.996
- Didn't we have this discussion before?
- We might have.

13:02.066 --> 13:05.034
- I don't remember. How many?
- Including you?

13:05.106 --> 13:07.594
It better be up to and including me.

13:07.667 --> 13:11.016
- Twelve.
- You slept with 12 different girls?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.979
Including you? Yes.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.051
- Ow! What'd you do that for?
- You're a pig!

13:15.124 --> 13:16.124
Why'd you hit me?

13:16.168 --> 13:18.003
Do you know how many men
I've had sex with?

13:18.069 --> 13:20.458
- Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
- Three.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.737
- Three?
- Three, including you.

13:22.805 --> 13:24.398
You only slept with three people?

13:24.469 --> 13:26.325
- I'm not the pig you are.
- Who?

13:26.390 --> 13:29.140
- You!
- No, who are the three, besides me.

13:29.207 --> 13:32.241
- John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
- Wow.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.061
That's why you should feel like a pig.
You men make me sick.

13:35.127 --> 13:38.673
- You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
- Animal, mineral or vegetable.

13:38.744 --> 13:40.239
Vegetable, meaning paraplegic.

13:40.313 --> 13:42.484
They put up
the least amount of struggle.

13:42.553 --> 13:45.041
After dropping a bombshell like that,
you owe me big.

13:45.114 --> 13:46.488
Name it.

13:46.553 --> 13:48.409
I want you to come with me on Monday.

13:48.474 --> 13:49.816
- Where?
- To school.

13:49.882 --> 13:52.981
There's a seminar about getting
back into a scholastic program

13:53.051 --> 13:54.906
after a lapse in enrollment.

13:54.971 --> 13:56.827
Can't we have a discussion
without that?

13:56.892 --> 13:58.419
It's important to me, Dante.

13:58.492 --> 14:01.013
You have so much potential
going to waste in this pit.

14:01.085 --> 14:04.663
- I wish you'd go back to school.
- Stop. You're making my head hurt.

14:04.733 --> 14:07.581
- Shit! Why're you getting up?
- I have class in 45 minutes.

14:09.693 --> 14:11.549
Willam?

14:11.614 --> 14:13.981
Hey, Ronni.
How you been, man?

14:14.111 --> 14:16.795
What, do you work here now?

14:16.895 --> 14:20.060
No, I was visiting my man.

14:20.128 --> 14:23.576
Dante, this is Willam Black.
This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

14:23.648 --> 14:27.904
- How you doing? Just the soda?
- No, and a pack of cigarettes.

14:27.969 --> 14:31.898
So where you been, man?
Still going to Seton Hall?

14:31.970 --> 14:36.095
No, I transferred into Monmouth
this year. I was tired of missing him.

14:36.195 --> 14:39.294
That's beautiful, man.

14:39.363 --> 14:41.502
So, you still talk to Silvan?

14:41.572 --> 14:44.572
I just talked to her on Monday.
We still hang out on weekends.

14:44.644 --> 14:46.499
Oh, that's great.

14:46.565 --> 14:50.210
Well, you two lovebirds
take it easy, okay?

14:50.277 --> 14:53.147
Bye. Take it easy.

14:53.222 --> 14:56.735
- [Ronni] That was Snowball.
- [Dante] Why do you call him that?

14:56.806 --> 15:00.385
Silvan made it up.
It's a blow job thing.

15:00.455 --> 15:02.310
What do you mean?

15:02.375 --> 15:05.791
After the blow job, he likes to have it
spit back into his mouth while kissing.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.719
It's called snowballing.

15:07.784 --> 15:10.436
- He requests this?
- He gets off on it.

15:10.505 --> 15:13.637
- Silvan can be talked into anything.
- Why do you say that?

15:13.706 --> 15:16.040
Like you said, she snowballed him.

15:16.106 --> 15:20.035
- Silvan? No, I snowballed him.
- Yeah, right.

15:20.106 --> 15:22.114
I'm serious.

15:22.187 --> 15:25.635
- You sucked that guy's dick?
- Yeah. How do you think I knew...

15:25.707 --> 15:29.320
You said you had sex with three guys.
You never mentioned him.

15:29.388 --> 15:32.039
- Because I never had sex with him.
- You sucked his dick!

15:32.109 --> 15:34.924
We went out a few times.
We never had sex, but we fooled around.

15:34.990 --> 15:37.957
Oh, my God. Why did you tell me
you only had sex with three guys?

15:38.029 --> 15:40.364
Because I did only have sex
with three guys.

15:40.430 --> 15:43.726
- Doesn't mean I didn't go with people.
- I feel so nauseous.

15:43.790 --> 15:45.646
I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.173
I did understand!

15:47.247 --> 15:50.063
That you had sex with three guys
and that's all you said!

15:50.128 --> 15:51.983
- Please calm down.
- How many?

15:52.048 --> 15:54.220
- How many dicks have you sucked?
- Let it go!

15:54.289 --> 15:55.751
Shut up and I'll tell you. Jesus!

15:55.825 --> 15:58.476
I didn't freak out when you told me
how many girls you fucked!

15:58.545 --> 16:01.328
This is different. This is important.
How many?

16:11.892 --> 16:13.747
Well?

16:15.317 --> 16:19.660
- Something like 36.
- What? Something like 36?

16:19.733 --> 16:22.384
- Lower your voice.
- What is that? "Something like 36"?

16:22.453 --> 16:24.309
Does that include me?

16:25.494 --> 16:27.982
- Uh... 37.
- I'm 37?

16:28.055 --> 16:31.187
- I'm going to class.
- Oh, my God.

16:31.255 --> 16:35.282
- 37! My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks!
- In a row?

16:35.352 --> 16:38.549
- Where you going?
- Listen, jerk. Until today, you never knew

16:38.617 --> 16:41.268
how many guys I slept with
because you never bothered to ask.

16:41.337 --> 16:44.950
You act all nonchalant about fucking
12 girls. I never had sex with 12 guys!

16:45.018 --> 16:47.407
- You sucked enough dick!
- I went down on a few guys.

16:47.482 --> 16:50.330
- A few?
- One was you. The last one, I might add.

16:50.394 --> 16:54.323
Which, if you're too stupid to comprehend,
means I've been faithful since we met.

16:54.395 --> 16:58.008
All the others I went with before I met you.
If you want to have a complex, go ahead.

16:58.076 --> 17:01.372
Don't look at me like the town whore,
you were plenty busy before you met me.

17:01.437 --> 17:05.049
Why couldn't you sleep with them
like any other decent person?

17:05.117 --> 17:06.972
Because going down isn't a big deal.

17:07.038 --> 17:09.853
I liked a guy, we'd make out,
and I'd go down on him.

17:09.917 --> 17:12.569
- But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
- I feel sick.

17:12.638 --> 17:14.362
I love you!
Don't feel sick.

17:14.431 --> 17:16.799
Every time I kiss you,
I'm gonna taste 36 other guys.

17:16.864 --> 17:19.548
I'm going to school.
Maybe later you'll be more rational.

17:19.616 --> 17:22.202
- I'm 37! I just can't...
- Goodbye, Dante!

17:24.641 --> 17:28.416
Hey, try not to suck any dick
on the way through the parking lot!

17:28.482 --> 17:30.904
Hey! Hey, you!
Get back here.

17:35.843 --> 17:40.415
I thought that place was supposed
to be open at 11:00. It's 11:20.

17:40.484 --> 17:43.713
I've already called his house twice.
He'll be here soon.

17:43.780 --> 17:47.229
Hey, it's not like
it's a demanding job over there.

17:47.301 --> 17:49.789
I'd like to get paid
to sit on my ass and watch TV.

17:49.862 --> 17:52.677
I walked in the other day,
that son of a bitch was sleeping.

17:52.742 --> 17:55.394
- I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
- Are you calling me a liar?

17:55.463 --> 17:59.173
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No! He was probably resting his eyes.

17:59.239 --> 18:01.476
What the hell is that,
"resting his eyes"?

18:01.544 --> 18:05.254
- Like he's some air traffic controller?
- Actually, that's his night job.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.616
Wise ass too, huh?
Go ahead. Keep cracking wise.

18:08.681 --> 18:11.878
That's why you jockey a register
in some fuckin' convenience store

18:11.946 --> 18:14.117
instead of working at a steady job.

18:14.185 --> 18:17.798
I've got no time to bullshit around,
waiting for that son of a bitch.

18:17.867 --> 18:19.809
Make sure he gets that.

18:19.883 --> 18:24.227
The number's 812. My name's Wynarski.
I wanted a movie tonight.

18:24.299 --> 18:26.755
If you tell me the movie title,
he'll hold it for you.

18:26.828 --> 18:30.603
Don't hurt yourself, buddy.
I'll go to Big Choice Video instead.

18:32.589 --> 18:35.557
[Door opens, closes]

18:35.630 --> 18:38.150
You forgot your keys.

18:49.008 --> 18:52.140
- Guy ain't here yet.
- You're kidding! It's almost 11:30.

18:52.209 --> 18:56.944
- I've been here since 11:00.
- I hate it when I can't rent videos!

18:57.010 --> 19:00.141
I would've went to Big Choice,
but the tape I want is on that wall.

19:00.210 --> 19:02.153
- Really? Which one?
- Dental School.

19:02.227 --> 19:04.616
You came for that too?
That's the movie I came for.

19:04.691 --> 19:06.546
- I have first dibs.
- Says who?

19:06.611 --> 19:09.743
Says me. I've been here half an hour.
I'd call that first dibs.

19:09.812 --> 19:13.261
- Ain't gonna happen. I'm getting it.
- Like hell you are.

19:13.333 --> 19:15.821
I'll bet you 20 bucks
you don't get to rent that tape.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.748
- Twenty bucks?
- Twenty bucks.

19:17.813 --> 19:21.130
All right, asshole. You're on.

19:36.856 --> 19:38.383
You're late.

19:38.457 --> 19:41.622
- What are you doing here?
- The boss called. Arthur fell ill.

19:41.690 --> 19:44.538
- Why are the shutters closed?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

19:44.602 --> 19:47.024
- Bunch of savages in this town.
- That's what I said.

19:47.099 --> 19:50.165
If I'd known you were here,
I'd have come even later.

19:50.267 --> 19:53.050
- What smells like shoe polish?
- Go open the store.

19:57.020 --> 20:00.949
- Hey, you see a set of keys around here?
- No time for love, Dr. Jones.

20:02.526 --> 20:04.795
Fucking kids.

20:25.345 --> 20:27.932
Some guy just came in
refusing to pay late fees.

20:28.002 --> 20:31.515
Said the store was closed for two hours
yesterday. I tore up his membership.

20:31.586 --> 20:32.961
Shocking abuse of authority.

20:33.027 --> 20:35.810
I'm a firm believer
in the philosophy of a ruling class,

20:35.876 --> 20:37.152
especially since I rule.

20:37.315 --> 20:40.894
- [Randal] Want something to drink?
- [Dante] No, thanks.

20:40.964 --> 20:43.136
Who was on your phone
this morning, like, 2:30?

20:43.205 --> 20:45.278
- I was trying to call for half an hour.
- Why?

20:45.349 --> 20:48.765
I wanted to use your car.
Snack cake.

20:49.862 --> 20:50.862
You don't wanna know.

20:50.906 --> 20:52.742
- You call Caitlin again?
- She called me.

20:52.807 --> 20:55.939
- You tell Veronica?
- One fight a day is all I can stomach.

20:56.007 --> 20:58.757
- What do you fight about?
- We don't fight about anything.

20:58.824 --> 21:01.824
She wants me to leave here, go
back to school, get some direction.

21:01.896 --> 21:04.352
I bet the most frequent
topic of argument is Caitlin.

21:04.425 --> 21:06.629
- You win.
- I'm going to offer you some advice.

21:06.697 --> 21:10.342
Let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin.
You been with Veronica how long?

21:10.409 --> 21:12.581
- Seven months.
- Chick's nuts about you.

21:12.650 --> 21:14.592
- How long you date Caitlin?
- Five years.

21:14.666 --> 21:17.056
Chick made you nuts.
She cheated on you how many times?

21:17.131 --> 21:18.986
- Eight and a half.
- Eight and a half?

21:19.051 --> 21:22.248
Party at John Kay's, senior year.
I pass out in his bedroom.

21:22.316 --> 21:24.902
- Caitlin jumps all over me.
- So that's cheating?

21:24.972 --> 21:28.268
- In the middle of it she called me Brad.
- She called you Brad?

21:28.333 --> 21:31.017
That's not cheating.
People say crazy shit during sex.

21:31.085 --> 21:34.020
- One time, I called this girl "mom".
- I hit the light, she freaks.

21:34.094 --> 21:36.429
- She thought I was Brad Michaelson.
- What?

21:36.494 --> 21:39.561
She was supposed to meet Brad
in a dark room. Picked the wrong one.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.638
- She didn't know I was at the party.
- God.

21:41.711 --> 21:44.046
- Great story, huh?
- That girl was vile to you.

21:44.111 --> 21:47.243
Interesting postscript.
Know who wound up in there with Brad?

21:47.312 --> 21:48.774
- Your mother?
- Alan Harris.

21:48.849 --> 21:52.145
- Chess team Alan Harris?
- The two moved to Idaho together.

21:52.209 --> 21:53.209
They raise sheep.

21:53.233 --> 21:55.722
- Frightening.
- Different strokes to move the world.

21:55.794 --> 21:59.340
I don't see how you could romanticize
your relationship with Caitlin.

21:59.411 --> 22:02.062
She broke your heart
and drove men to deviant lifestyles.

22:02.131 --> 22:04.019
- There was a lot of good.
- Oh, yeah?

22:04.083 --> 22:06.287
Aside from the cheating,
we were a great couple.

22:06.355 --> 22:09.804
That's what high school was about.
Algebra, bad lunch and infidelity.

22:09.877 --> 22:12.365
- Think things will be different this time?
- They are.

22:12.437 --> 22:15.569
When she calls me now, she's different.
Frightened, vulnerable.

22:15.638 --> 22:18.987
She's finishing college
and about to enter the real world.

22:19.062 --> 22:21.550
- Shit, I gotta place an order.
- Talkin' to myself.

22:21.622 --> 22:25.169
- I'm listening. She's leaving college...?
- And she's looking for support.

22:25.239 --> 22:27.444
This is leading our relationship
to a new level.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.527
What about Veronica?

22:28.600 --> 22:31.415
The arguments Veronica and I have
are a manifestation

22:31.480 --> 22:33.488
of a subconscious desire
to break up,

22:33.561 --> 22:35.895
to pursue a meaningful relationship
with Caitlin.

22:35.961 --> 22:38.547
- Caitlin's on the same wavelength?
- It's safe to say yes.

22:38.618 --> 22:41.585
- I think all four of you better talk it over.
- All four?

22:41.658 --> 22:45.750
You, Veronica, Caitlin
and Caitlin's fiancé.

22:54.620 --> 22:58.233
- Do you sell video tapes?
- Yeah. What are you looking for?

22:58.301 --> 23:01.269
- Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.
- Uh, one second.

23:01.341 --> 23:04.637
I'm on with the distribution house.
Let me make sure they got it.

23:04.702 --> 23:07.321
- What's it called again?
- Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.

23:07.390 --> 23:09.300
- [Child] Happy Scrappy...
- She loves it.

23:09.375 --> 23:10.455
Obviously.

23:11.424 --> 23:15.353
This is RST Video calling.
Customer number 4352.

23:15.424 --> 23:17.595
I'd like to place an order.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.836
I need one each of the following tapes:

23:19.905 --> 23:21.913
Whispers In The Wind,
To Each His Own,

23:21.986 --> 23:25.052
Put It Where It Doesn't Belong,
My Pipes Need Cleaning,

23:25.122 --> 23:28.254
All Tit Fucking Volume Eight,
I Need Your Cock,

23:28.322 --> 23:31.618
Ass Worshipping Rim Jobbers,
My Cunt And Eight Shafts,

23:31.683 --> 23:35.808
Cum Clean, Cum Gargling Naked Sluts,
Cum Buns III,

23:35.876 --> 23:38.593
Cumming In Socks,
Cum On Ilene,

23:38.661 --> 23:40.701
Huge Black Cocks
with Pearly White Cum,

23:40.773 --> 23:43.457
Girls Who Crave Cock,
Girls Who Crave Cunt,

23:43.525 --> 23:47.071
Men Alone Il: The KY Connection,
Pink Pussy Lips,

23:47.142 --> 23:50.110
oh, yeah, and
All Holes Filled with Hard Cock.

23:50.183 --> 23:54.045
Yup. Oh, wait a minute.
What was that called again?

23:54.119 --> 23:55.581
# I'm a needle, you know

23:55.655 --> 24:00.031
# Never want to be a haystack

24:00.104 --> 24:03.236
# Don't ever want to break
Your heart in two

24:03.305 --> 24:06.753
# Know the crowd
Is gonna sell their soul

24:06.825 --> 24:09.793
# Take it anywhere I know
Well, I promise you

24:09.866 --> 24:11.906
# It's making me sick #

24:13.835 --> 24:16.618
Yes, I'd like to check on
a misprint in today's edition.

24:16.683 --> 24:18.756
Today's edition.

24:18.828 --> 24:22.440
It says,
"Bree to wed Asian design major".

24:22.508 --> 24:24.363
No, everything's spelled fine.

24:24.428 --> 24:27.495
I was just wondering
if the article was a misprint.

24:27.565 --> 24:30.151
I don't know,
a typographical error or something.

24:30.221 --> 24:34.794
Maybe it should say, "Caitlin Bray"
or "Caitlin Bre" with one "e".

24:34.863 --> 24:39.501
I'm a curious party.
A curious party.

24:39.567 --> 24:41.290
I'm an ex- boyfriend, and...

24:41.360 --> 24:44.622
I talk to her all the time and
she never mentioned this engagement.

24:44.688 --> 24:47.591
That's why I'm thinking
maybe it's a misprint.

24:49.137 --> 24:53.927
Are you sure? Maybe there's
a vindictive printer working for you.

24:54.002 --> 24:57.897
Meaning like, someone who asked her out
once and got shot down,

24:57.970 --> 25:02.314
and this is his revenge by putting
this bogus article in the paper.

25:02.387 --> 25:04.722
Hello. Hello?

25:11.093 --> 25:13.395
- [Sniffing]
- [Cat meows]

25:13.462 --> 25:17.107
I don't care if she's my cousin, I'm
gonna knock those boots again tonight.

25:17.174 --> 25:20.557
- Look. The fuckin' human vacuum.
- Scumbag, what are you doing?

25:20.631 --> 25:23.501
- Hanging with Silent Bob and his cousin.
- He's your cousin?

25:23.576 --> 25:25.583
- He's from Russia too.
- No way.

25:25.655 --> 25:29.365
- What part of Russia?
- Do I look like his fuckin' biographer?

25:29.432 --> 25:33.524
- Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
- Moscow.

25:33.593 --> 25:37.368
- He only speaks Russian?
- He speaks some English, but not good.

25:37.433 --> 25:40.401
- Is he staying here?
- He's moving to the big city this week.

25:40.474 --> 25:42.646
- He wants to be a metal singer.
- [Girl] No way.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.203
I swear. Olaf, metal.

25:45.275 --> 25:48.887
That's his fucking metal face.
Olaf, girl nice?

25:48.955 --> 25:51.509
- [Speaks Russian]
- That's fucked up, man.

25:51.580 --> 25:54.809
- What did he say?
- I don't know, but this guy's a character.

25:54.877 --> 25:57.844
- He really wants to play metal?
- He's got his own band in Moscow.

25:57.917 --> 26:01.366
- Called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans".
- That doesn't sound metal.

26:01.438 --> 26:04.569
You gotta hear him sing.
Olaf, "Berserker".

26:04.638 --> 26:08.251
- Come on, man, "Berserker"!
- Does he sing in English or Russian?

26:08.319 --> 26:11.254
In English. Come on, "Berserker".
Girls think sexy.

26:12.640 --> 26:16.154
- Aah. Aah.
- Watch, he's gonna sing it. It's too funny.

26:16.225 --> 26:20.633
# My love for you
Is like a truck, berserker

26:20.705 --> 26:24.732
# Would you like
Some making fuck, berserker #

26:24.802 --> 26:27.836
- That's fuckin' funny, man.
- Did he say, "making fuck"?

26:27.907 --> 26:31.683
[Science fiction movie sounds]

26:31.748 --> 26:33.406
[Man screaming]

26:33.475 --> 26:35.002
[Sounds stop]

26:47.622 --> 26:51.933
# My love for you
Is ticking clock, berserker

26:52.007 --> 26:56.743
# Would you like
To suck my cock, berserker #

26:56.808 --> 26:59.973
That's beautiful, man.

27:03.177 --> 27:05.960
Hold on to the counter
and I'll pull.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.993
Usually I just turn the can upside down.

27:09.066 --> 27:11.401
Maybe we oughta soap your hand up.

27:11.467 --> 27:14.599
They ought to put a warning on these,
like with cigarettes.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.423
I think it's coming!

27:19.307 --> 27:22.603
Thanks. I thought I was going
to have to go to the hospital.

27:22.669 --> 27:25.255
I'll throw this out
as a precautionary measure.

27:25.325 --> 27:27.496
[Chuckling]
Stings a little.

27:27.565 --> 27:31.560
A word of advice. Sometimes you
got to let those hard-to-reach chips go.

27:31.631 --> 27:33.573
- [Door opens]
- Thanks.

27:35.247 --> 27:38.215
That article's accurate.
Caitlin really is getting married.

27:38.287 --> 27:41.419
- Know what I just watched?
- Me pulling a can off some moron's fist?

27:41.488 --> 27:42.798
Return Of The Jedi.

27:42.864 --> 27:45.996
Didn't you hear me?
Caitlin is really getting married.

27:46.065 --> 27:49.677
What did you like better?
Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back?

27:49.745 --> 27:51.688
- Empire.
- Blasphemy.

27:52.658 --> 27:54.546
Empire had the better ending.

27:54.610 --> 27:57.906
Luke gets his hand cut off,
finds out Vader's his father.

27:57.971 --> 28:01.266
Han gets frozen, taken away by Boba Fett.
It ends on such a down note.

28:01.332 --> 28:04.627
I mean, that's what life is
a series of down endings.

28:04.692 --> 28:06.994
All Jedi had was a bunch of muppets.

28:07.061 --> 28:10.378
There was something else going on
in Jedi. I never noticed it 'til today.

28:10.453 --> 28:12.363
They build another Death Star, right?

28:12.437 --> 28:15.667
The first one was fully operational
before the rebels destroyed it.

28:15.734 --> 28:17.742
Luke blew it up. Give credit.

28:17.815 --> 28:20.052
The second one was being built
when they blew it up.

28:20.119 --> 28:21.679
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

28:21.751 --> 28:24.240
Something never sat right with me
that second time.

28:24.311 --> 28:26.963
I couldn't put my finger on it.
Something wasn't right.

28:27.032 --> 28:28.177
And you figured it out.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.736
The first Death Star
was manned by the Imperial Army.

28:30.809 --> 28:34.225
The only people on board were Storm
Troopers, dignitaries, Imperialists.

28:34.298 --> 28:35.298
Basically.

28:35.354 --> 28:37.940
So when they blew it up, no problem.
Evil's punished.

28:38.010 --> 28:41.524
- And the second time around?
- It wasn't even done being built yet.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.766
- It was still under construction.
- So?

28:43.835 --> 28:46.105
A job of that magnitude would require

28:46.172 --> 28:49.075
a lot more manpower
than the Imperial Army had to offer.

28:49.148 --> 28:51.767
I'll bet they brought
independent contractors in.

28:51.836 --> 28:54.487
- Plumbers, roofers...
- Not just Imperialists.

28:54.557 --> 28:57.493
- Is that what you're getting at?
- To get it built quickly,

28:57.565 --> 28:59.508
they'd hire anybody
that could do the job.

28:59.582 --> 29:02.233
Think the average Storm Trooper
can install a toilet main?

29:02.302 --> 29:06.645
- All they know is killing.
- So they bring in independent contractors.

29:06.719 --> 29:11.455
- Why are you so upset.
- All those contractors brought in are killed.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.171
Casualties of a war
they had nothing to do with.

29:14.240 --> 29:18.267
Look, you're a roofer. Some juicy
government contract comes your way.

29:18.337 --> 29:21.055
You got a wife and kids,
the two-story in suburbia.

29:21.122 --> 29:24.090
This is a government contract
which means all sorts of benefits.

29:24.163 --> 29:28.189
Along come these militants who blast
everything within a three-mile radius.

29:28.259 --> 29:30.681
You didn't ask for that.
You had no personal politics.

29:30.755 --> 29:33.690
- You're trying to scrape out a living.
- I don't mean to interrupt,

29:33.764 --> 29:36.580
- what are you talking about?
- The ending of Return Of The Jedi.

29:36.645 --> 29:37.922
He's trying to convince me

29:37.989 --> 29:41.153
that any independent contractors
working on the Death Star

29:41.221 --> 29:43.709
were innocent victims
when it was destroyed.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.336
I'm a contractor myself.
I'm a roofer.

29:46.407 --> 29:48.262
"Done And Ready Home Improvements".

29:48.327 --> 29:51.459
Speaking as a roofer, I can tell you
a roofer's personal politics

29:51.527 --> 29:54.495
- comes into play when choosing jobs.
- Like when?

29:54.568 --> 29:57.864
Three weeks ago, I was offered a job
up in the hills. Beautiful house.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.744
Tons of property.
A simple re-shingling job.

30:00.809 --> 30:04.258
They told me if I could finish it
in one day, I would double my price.

30:04.330 --> 30:06.948
- Then I realized whose house it was.
- [Dante] Whose was it?

30:07.018 --> 30:10.816
- Dominic Bambino's.
- Babyface Bambino? The gangster?

30:10.891 --> 30:14.666
The same! The money was right,
but the risk was too high.

30:14.731 --> 30:18.594
I knew who he was, and based on that,
I turned the job over to a friend.

30:18.668 --> 30:21.156
- Based on personal politics.
- Right!

30:21.229 --> 30:25.321
The next week, the Foresci family
put a hit on Babyface's house.

30:25.389 --> 30:28.619
My friend was shot and killed.
Didn't even finish re-shingling.

30:28.686 --> 30:29.799
No way.

30:29.871 --> 30:33.733
[Man] I'm alive because I knew the risk
involved in that particular client.

30:33.807 --> 30:35.662
My friend wasn't so lucky.

30:35.728 --> 30:39.623
Any contractor working on that
Death Star knew the risk involved.

30:39.696 --> 30:42.184
If they got killed,
it's their own fault.

30:42.256 --> 30:45.159
A roofer listens to this,
not his wallet.

30:54.994 --> 30:59.086
They say so much, but they never
tell you if it's any good.

31:02.036 --> 31:05.168
Are either one of these any good?

31:05.237 --> 31:07.092
- Sir?
- What?

31:07.157 --> 31:10.770
- Are either one of these any good?
- I don't watch movies.

31:10.838 --> 31:14.067
[Sighs] Well, have you heard anything
about either one of them?

31:14.134 --> 31:17.266
I find it's best to stay out
of other people's affairs.

31:17.334 --> 31:21.110
You mean you haven't heard anybody
say anything about either one of these?

31:21.175 --> 31:23.030
Nope.

31:23.095 --> 31:24.951
[Sighs]

31:27.000 --> 31:30.230
- Well, what about these two?
- They suck.

31:30.297 --> 31:33.593
[Sighs]
These are the same two movies.

31:33.657 --> 31:36.974
- You weren't paying any attention.
- No, I wasn't.

31:37.050 --> 31:39.222
I don't think your manager
would appreciate...

31:39.291 --> 31:42.390
- I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
- I beg your pardon?

31:42.459 --> 31:45.907
Your ruse.
Your cunning attempt to trick me.

31:45.980 --> 31:50.072
I was only pointing out that
you weren't paying any attention.

31:50.140 --> 31:51.996
And I hope it feels good.

31:52.061 --> 31:55.160
- You hope what feels good?
- I hope it feels so good to be right.

31:55.229 --> 31:57.466
Nothing's more exhilarating
than pointing out

31:57.534 --> 31:59.357
the shortcomings of others, is there?

31:59.423 --> 32:02.555
[Heavy sigh] Well, this is
the last time I rent here!

32:02.623 --> 32:05.755
- You will be missed.
- Screw you!

32:07.840 --> 32:12.096
- You're not allowed to rent here anymore!
- [Jay] Yeah!

32:12.160 --> 32:14.015
Screw me?

32:26.404 --> 32:28.924
You'll never believe what this
unruly customer said.

32:28.995 --> 32:30.425
- Wait.
- She in here?

32:30.500 --> 32:32.508
This guy's going through all the eggs.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.784
This has been going on
for 20 minutes now.

32:34.852 --> 32:37.635
- What's he looking for?
- Said he has to find the perfect dozen.

32:37.701 --> 32:40.419
- Perfect dozen?
- Each egg has to be perfect.

32:40.486 --> 32:42.657
- The quest isn't going well?
- Obviously not.

32:42.726 --> 32:45.956
- Look at the cartons that didn't make it.
- Why doesn't he mix and match?

32:46.022 --> 32:48.412
- I told him that, and he yelled at me.
- What'd he say?

32:48.488 --> 32:51.619
He said it's important to have standards.
No one has pride anymore.

32:51.687 --> 32:53.826
It's not like
you laid the eggs yourself.

32:53.897 --> 32:56.744
I give him five more minutes.
After that, I'm calling the cops.

32:56.809 --> 32:59.679
I don't need this.
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

33:00.970 --> 33:02.825
Two packs of cigarettes.

33:05.450 --> 33:08.833
- I'm as puzzled as you.
- I've actually seen it before.

33:08.907 --> 33:11.559
- You know him?
- No, but I know the behavior.

33:11.628 --> 33:13.668
He's looking for the perfect
carton of eggs?

33:13.740 --> 33:14.918
[Randal] How'd you know?

33:14.988 --> 33:18.600
- I'll bet you he's a guidance counselor.
- [Dante] Why do you say that?

33:18.668 --> 33:22.531
I saw it happen in Food City, last year.
Different guy, though.

33:22.605 --> 33:25.322
Stock boy said he looked through
cartons for half an hour,

33:25.389 --> 33:27.397
doing all sorts
of endurance tests and stuff.

33:27.470 --> 33:30.667
I asked him why nobody ever called
the manager, and he said it happens...

33:30.735 --> 33:32.558
two, three times a week, sometimes more.

33:32.623 --> 33:34.762
- Get out of here.
- No, I kid you not.

33:34.832 --> 33:38.094
They call it shell shock. Seems to
only happen with guidance counselors.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.779
They used to make a big deal of it.
They just let it go now.

33:40.848 --> 33:43.882
They always pay for whatever they break.
They never bother anybody.

33:43.953 --> 33:45.448
Why guidance counselors?

33:45.521 --> 33:48.686
If your job was as meaningless
as theirs, wouldn't you go crazy too?

33:48.754 --> 33:52.104
- My guidance counselor was worthless.
- See?

33:52.178 --> 33:54.513
It's important to have a job
that makes a difference.

33:54.579 --> 33:59.566
That's why I manually masturbate caged
animals for artificial insemination.

34:02.036 --> 34:04.851
# Go your own way

34:04.917 --> 34:09.904
# You can call it
Another lonely day #

34:32.697 --> 34:36.310
Did you ever notice
that all the prices end in "9"?

34:36.379 --> 34:38.234
Damn, that's eerie.

34:38.299 --> 34:40.983
Know how much the average
jiz-mopper makes per hour?

34:41.051 --> 34:42.065
What's a jiz-mopper?

34:42.139 --> 34:45.272
The guy that cleans up the nudie booths
after each guy jerks off.

34:45.340 --> 34:47.347
- "Nudie booth"?
- Yeah, nudie booth.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.909
- You ever been in a nudie booth?
- Guess not.

34:49.981 --> 34:51.126
Oh, man, it's great.

34:51.197 --> 34:54.231
You go into a booth, and there's
glass between you and these chicks.

34:54.302 --> 34:57.434
- They put on a show for you for ten bucks.
- What kind of a show?

34:57.503 --> 35:00.470
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit
you'd like to see chicks do.

35:00.542 --> 35:04.089
These chicks do it all. They insert
things into any opening on their body.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.494
- Any opening.
- Can we not talk about this now?

35:06.560 --> 35:09.527
The jiz-mopper's job is to clean it up
after each guy shoots a load.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.575
Everybody does it right on the window.

35:11.649 --> 35:14.748
I don't know if you know this,
cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it.

35:14.817 --> 35:17.720
- I will never come to this place again.
- Excuse me?

35:17.794 --> 35:21.504
Using filthy language in front of
the customers. You both should be fired.

35:21.570 --> 35:24.953
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess we kinda got carried away.

35:25.027 --> 35:27.930
I don't know
if sorry can make up for it.

35:28.004 --> 35:30.688
You've highly offended me.

35:30.757 --> 35:33.692
Well, if you think that's offensive,
check this out.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.554
Oh!
[Screaming]

35:35.621 --> 35:38.240
- You can see her kidneys.
- Why do you do things like that?

35:38.310 --> 35:41.060
- You know he's going tell the boss.
- Who cares?

35:41.126 --> 35:43.941
He's an asshole. Everybody
that comes in is way too uptight.

35:44.006 --> 35:46.822
This job would be great
if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

35:46.887 --> 35:50.019
- I'm gonna hear from the boss tomorrow.
- Would you loosen up?

35:50.088 --> 35:53.056
You'd feel better if you'd
rip into the occasional customer.

35:53.128 --> 35:55.944
Why? I don't bother them
and they don't bother me.

35:56.009 --> 36:00.516
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that
annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.

36:00.585 --> 36:03.074
- There aren't!
- How can you lie like that?

36:03.146 --> 36:08.515
Why don't you vent? Vent your
frustrations. Who pisses you off?

36:08.587 --> 36:11.883
Well, I guess it isn't
customers in particular.

36:11.948 --> 36:14.599
Maybe just a group of customers.

36:14.669 --> 36:18.793
- Well, let's hear it.
- Well, the Milk Maids.

36:18.861 --> 36:20.716
The Milk Maids?

36:20.782 --> 36:24.524
The women that go through every gallon
of milk, looking for that later date,

36:24.590 --> 36:27.557
as if somewhere beyond all the
gallons is a container of milk...

36:27.630 --> 36:30.216
that won't go bad for like a decade.

36:30.287 --> 36:34.282
You know who I can do without?
The people in the video store.

36:34.352 --> 36:36.392
- Which ones?
- All of 'em.

36:36.464 --> 36:40.010
What would you get for a six-year-old
boy who chronically wets his bed?

36:40.081 --> 36:42.765
So, do you have any new movies in?

36:42.833 --> 36:47.307
Do you have that one with that guy who
was in that movie that was out last year?

36:47.378 --> 36:49.233
They never rent quality flicks.

36:49.298 --> 36:52.365
They always pick the most intellectually
devoid movie on the racks.

36:52.435 --> 36:54.857
Oooh! Navy SEALS!

36:54.932 --> 36:58.281
In order to join they have to have an I.Q.
Less than their shoe size.

36:58.356 --> 37:02.219
You think you get stupid questions?
You should hear the barrage that I get.

37:02.293 --> 37:04.660
There's no ice?
I've got to drink this coffee hot?

37:04.725 --> 37:07.987
So, how much is this thing anyway?

37:10.134 --> 37:12.720
Do you sell hubcaps
for a '72 Pinto hatchback?

37:12.791 --> 37:14.646
Ooh! Mini-Trucker magazine.

37:14.711 --> 37:17.581
- See? You vented. Don't you feel better?
- No.

37:17.655 --> 37:20.623
- Why not?
- My ex-girlfriend is getting married.

37:20.696 --> 37:23.958
You got a one-track mind.
It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin.

37:24.024 --> 37:25.880
Veronica!

37:27.738 --> 37:30.869
- What happened to home by 12:00?
- Boss hasn't shown up yet.

37:30.938 --> 37:33.272
- How come you're not in class?
- Got canceled.

37:33.338 --> 37:36.634
- So I brought you some lunch.
- What is it?

37:36.699 --> 37:39.666
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts
cut off. What do you think?

37:39.739 --> 37:42.391
- It's lasagna.
- Really?

37:42.460 --> 37:44.794
Oh, you're the queen.

37:44.861 --> 37:47.676
I'm glad you calmed down a bit.
Hi, Randal.

37:47.741 --> 37:50.556
- Thirty-seven?
- Shut up!

37:50.622 --> 37:53.917
Yes, I've calmed down.
I'm not happy, but I'll be able to deal.

37:53.982 --> 37:55.673
[Sucking sound]

37:55.743 --> 37:58.012
Why don't you go back
to the video store?

38:02.240 --> 38:05.688
- You had to tell him?
- I had to. He put it into perspective.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.575
- What did he say?
- He said at least he wasn't 36.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.495
And that made you feel better?

38:10.561 --> 38:13.857
And he said most of them were college
guys I never even seen or met before.

38:13.922 --> 38:16.890
- The ostrich syndrome: If you don't see it...
- It isn't there. Yes.

38:16.963 --> 38:20.094
- Thank you for being rational.
- Thank you for the lasagna.

38:20.162 --> 38:21.951
- Couldn't get the shutters open?
- No.

38:22.019 --> 38:25.217
I called the locksmith. The earliest
he can be here is tomorrow morning.

38:25.284 --> 38:27.772
Bummer. Well, I gotta
head back for the 1:30 class.

38:27.844 --> 38:31.707
- What time you get finished?
- 8:00. I have a sorority meeting 'til 9:00.

38:31.780 --> 38:34.334
I'll see you when you close.
Can we go out for coffee?

38:34.406 --> 38:36.261
- Sure.
- Good.

38:36.326 --> 38:38.498
See you when you close.
Enjoy the lasagna.

38:38.566 --> 38:41.862
[Door opens, closes]

38:46.247 --> 38:49.248
[Sucking sound]

38:55.113 --> 38:56.968
Vermont?

38:57.034 --> 39:00.068
No, that can't be.
I just talked to him this morning.

39:00.138 --> 39:02.724
He left at what time?

39:02.795 --> 39:06.887
He really went to Vermont? When
the hell was someone going to tell me?

39:06.955 --> 39:09.606
He promised me he'd be here by noon!

39:09.676 --> 39:13.768
Jesus, when does he get back? Tuesday?
You've gotta be fucking kidding me!

39:13.836 --> 39:16.171
I've got a game at 2:00,
the shutters are jammed.

39:16.237 --> 39:19.850
And he's in Vermont?
I'm not even supposed to be here today!

39:19.918 --> 39:22.252
[Sighing]

39:23.278 --> 39:25.547
So I'm stuck here until closing?

39:25.614 --> 39:29.445
Oh, this is just great.
I can't fucking believe this.

39:31.440 --> 39:34.796
No. No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

39:35.793 --> 39:38.127
Yeah, I know.

39:38.194 --> 39:41.642
No, I'll be all right.

39:41.714 --> 39:44.365
Well, that's all I can do, right?
Yeah.

39:44.434 --> 39:47.249
- All right, thanks. Bye.
- Vermont?

39:47.315 --> 39:50.217
- Can you fucking believe this?
- He didn't mention that to you?

39:50.291 --> 39:52.942
Not a word!
Not a fucking word, that slippery shit.

39:53.012 --> 39:55.184
- So, what? You're stuck here all day?
- Fuck!

39:55.252 --> 39:57.107
- Why'd you apologize?
- What?

39:57.173 --> 39:59.824
I heard you. Why?
You had every reason to be mad.

39:59.893 --> 40:02.861
- I know!
- That seems to be the leitmotif in your life.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.941
- Ever backing down.
- I don't back down!

40:05.014 --> 40:07.502
You always back down.
You assume blame that's not yours.

40:07.574 --> 40:10.225
You come in on your day off.
You buckle like a belt.

40:10.296 --> 40:13.111
- Know what pisses me off?
- That I'm right about your buckling?

40:13.176 --> 40:15.664
- I'm going to miss the game!
- Because you buckled.

40:15.736 --> 40:18.868
- Shut up with that shit. It ain't helping!
- Don't yell at me, pal.

40:18.937 --> 40:21.109
- I'm sorry.
- See? There you go again.

40:21.177 --> 40:24.887
- I can't believe I'm going to miss the game.
- At least we're stuck here together.

40:24.954 --> 40:27.191
You got a customer.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.746
What?
What do you want?

40:33.499 --> 40:36.467
I can't fucking believe this.

40:36.540 --> 40:39.507
Yeah, hello, Sanford.
Dante.

40:39.580 --> 40:43.356
I can't play today.
I'm stuck at work.

40:43.421 --> 40:47.196
Yeah, I know I'm not scheduled today...
Forget it.

40:47.262 --> 40:51.769
Point is, I can't play today.
Neither can Randal. He's working too.

40:53.119 --> 40:56.764
Wait a second.
Do we have to play at the park?

40:56.832 --> 40:59.450
Hold on.
You feeling limber?

41:09.474 --> 41:12.257
- Pull my laces tighter, man.
- I've got to tell you,

41:12.322 --> 41:14.657
this is one of the ballsiest moves
I've been privy to.

41:14.723 --> 41:17.538
I never thought you capable of such
a disregard of store policy.

41:17.604 --> 41:20.419
- I told him I had a game. It's his own fault.
- No arguments here.

41:20.484 --> 41:23.452
- Insubordination rules.
- I just want to play hockey.

41:23.525 --> 41:24.834
I'm gonna grab a Gatorade.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.810
If you grab one,
then everybody will.

41:26.885 --> 41:29.057
- So?
- Who's gonna pay for these Gatorades?

41:29.126 --> 41:31.941
- What do you care, motherfucker?
- I have a responsibility.

41:32.006 --> 41:34.821
- Everybody can't grab free drinks.
- What responsibility?

41:34.887 --> 41:37.702
- You're closing the store to play hockey.
- He's got a point.

41:37.767 --> 41:40.255
Will you let me maintain
some semblance of control?

41:40.327 --> 41:42.662
If you're gonna be insubordinate,
go the full nine,

41:42.728 --> 41:44.583
not pussy out
when it comes to free shit.

41:44.649 --> 41:46.624
As if we're going to have a run
on Gatorade.

41:46.696 --> 41:49.152
- Fuckin' A.
- All right! Jesus, you fuckers are pushy!

41:49.225 --> 41:51.298
I hear Caitlin's marrying
an Asian drum major.

41:51.370 --> 41:53.280
- Design major.
- Can we not talk about this?

41:53.353 --> 41:57.315
Fine, but you're living in denial
and suppressing rage, motherfucker.

41:57.386 --> 42:00.037
- You gonna lock the store?
- You gonna lock the video store?

42:00.107 --> 42:02.923
Look who you're asking here.
How're we gonna block the street?

42:02.988 --> 42:06.567
- We're not playing in the street.
- Then where are we gonna play?

42:12.461 --> 42:14.566
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em!

42:26.511 --> 42:29.807
[Yelling]

42:39.090 --> 42:41.960
I got it! I got it!
It's mine, it's mine!

42:50.772 --> 42:52.627
Yeah!

42:53.684 --> 42:56.019
[Yelling continues]

43:00.854 --> 43:02.709
Hit 'em!

43:04.695 --> 43:06.768
All right, here we go.
I got it.

43:06.839 --> 43:08.944
- When is this period over?
- Eight minutes.

43:09.015 --> 43:11.666
What, are you shitting me?
I wanna get cigarettes.

43:11.736 --> 43:15.031
- Just wait a few minutes.
- I'm gonna break my neck on this ladder.

43:15.097 --> 43:18.163
Lose the skates, Dorothy Hamill,
and open the fucking store!

43:18.233 --> 43:19.608
- Where are you?
- He's busy!

43:19.663 --> 43:20.663
- In a second!

43:20.697 --> 43:24.310
Fuck "in a second"!
Oh, look at you. You can't even pass.

43:24.378 --> 43:27.346
- [Dante] I can pass!
- How about covering the point? You suck!

43:27.419 --> 43:30.715
- Who are you to make assessments?
- I'll assess all I want, pal!

43:30.779 --> 43:34.391
- Dante, you in or out?
- Don't pass to this guy. He sucks.

43:34.460 --> 43:36.948
- You're any better?
- I can whip your ass any day.

43:37.020 --> 43:39.836
- Easy to say over there.
- Give me a stick, pretty boy!

43:39.901 --> 43:42.935
I'll knock your fucking teeth out
and pass all over your ass!

43:43.005 --> 43:44.761
- You open?
- Yeah, you open?

43:44.862 --> 43:47.994
- No!
- No!

43:48.062 --> 43:50.583
There's a stick.
You're shooting up against this goal.

43:50.655 --> 43:52.892
Hey, Redding! Come on.
Get this fucker!

44:05.026 --> 44:06.553
Oh, man! Hey!

44:06.626 --> 44:09.496
Come on. Let's go, let's go!
Come on, come on. Get him!

44:09.570 --> 44:11.480
Come on. Get him, get him!

44:24.644 --> 44:27.776
- Give me another ball.
- There are no more.

44:27.845 --> 44:30.333
What are you talking about?
How many balls you bring?

44:30.405 --> 44:33.854
I brought the orange one
and... the orange one.

44:34.375 --> 44:36.197
Hey, any balls down there?

44:36.263 --> 44:40.039
[Jay] About the biggest pair
you ever seen, dingleberry.

44:40.104 --> 44:43.171
- You only brought one?
- I thought Redding brought all the balls.

44:43.241 --> 44:45.958
- [Redding] Dante had the balls.
- Nobody has another ball?

44:46.024 --> 44:47.431
Shit!

44:47.497 --> 44:52.037
We got what, 12 minutes of a game
and it's over? Fuck!

44:52.106 --> 44:55.718
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

44:57.546 --> 45:00.296
I still get free Gatorade, right?

45:10.669 --> 45:13.637
- Be careful.
- I'm trying.

45:13.710 --> 45:17.486
You know, the insides of those has
got stuff that can give you cancer.

45:17.551 --> 45:19.886
- So I'm told.
- Yeah.

45:19.951 --> 45:23.563
I had a friend that chewed glass
for a living. In the circus.

45:23.631 --> 45:26.927
And he got cancer
from chewing fluorescent bulb glass?

45:26.992 --> 45:30.605
- Got hit by a bus.
- Oh. Can I help you?

45:32.593 --> 45:37.101
Well, uh, that depends.
You got maybe a toilet in here?

45:37.170 --> 45:40.137
- Yeah, but it's for employees only.
- I understand.

45:40.210 --> 45:43.506
But I, uh, thought maybe
you'd let me use it anyway.

45:43.571 --> 45:47.663
I'm not so young anymore and I'm,
how do you say, a little incontinent.

45:47.731 --> 45:51.660
- Sure. In the back, through the cooler.
- Thank you, sonny boy.

46:01.334 --> 46:05.044
Say, uh, what kind of toilet paper
you got back there?

46:05.111 --> 46:08.144
- The white kind.
- I didn't ask about the color.

46:08.215 --> 46:11.664
I mean, is it rough
or is it cottony?

46:11.736 --> 46:14.453
- Actually, it's kinda rough.
- Oh, boy!

46:14.520 --> 46:17.750
It's gonna knock the hell
out of my hemorrhoids.

46:17.817 --> 46:20.949
I thought maybe you could
let me have a roll of the soft stuff.

46:21.018 --> 46:23.506
I see you sell
the soft stuff back there.

46:23.578 --> 46:26.230
- Yeah, but...
- Come on, boitshik! What's the difference?

46:26.299 --> 46:29.496
You said yourself
you have the rough stuff in the back.

46:29.564 --> 46:32.150
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- Thank you, sonny boy.

46:32.220 --> 46:34.075
You're a lifesaver.

46:42.398 --> 46:44.886
Say, young fella,
I hate to bother you again,

46:44.958 --> 46:48.407
but, uh, maybe I could have something
in the back there to read?

46:48.478 --> 46:50.334
A paper or something?

46:50.399 --> 46:52.570
Sometimes it takes me a while,

46:52.640 --> 46:55.323
and I like to have something
to read while it's going on.

46:55.392 --> 46:57.247
[Dante] Yeah, sure, go ahead.

46:57.312 --> 47:00.411
[Man] One of the magazines you got
in the back behind the counter.

47:00.481 --> 47:03.613
- The porno mags?
- Yeah!

47:03.681 --> 47:06.016
I like the cartoons.
They make me laugh.

47:06.082 --> 47:09.378
They draw some of the biggest titties
you ever saw.

47:09.442 --> 47:12.257
Not this one. Maybe the one
you got underneath this one.

47:12.323 --> 47:14.657
- They got bigger titties in there.
- Here.

47:14.724 --> 47:17.375
- Now leave me alone.
- Oh, thank you, sonny boy.

47:17.444 --> 47:19.299
I appreciate it.

47:22.821 --> 47:24.283
Hell of a game.

47:24.357 --> 47:28.252
One ball? I close the store, they come
all the way here, for one ball?

47:28.326 --> 47:30.432
Hockey is hockey.
At least we got to play.

47:30.503 --> 47:33.318
Twelve minutes is not a game.
It's hardly even a warmup.

47:33.383 --> 47:37.792
- Bitch, bitch. Want something to drink?
- Yeah, a Gatorade.

47:37.864 --> 47:42.621
- Hey, what happened to all the Gatorade?
- Exactly. They drank it all.

47:42.696 --> 47:46.210
- [Randal] Know what Sanford told me?
- [Dante] I can't believe she's marrying.

47:46.281 --> 47:47.775
- Julie Dwyer died.
- Yeah, right.

47:47.849 --> 47:49.857
- No, I'm serious.
- Oh, my God!

47:49.930 --> 47:52.897
Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
He found out this morning.

47:52.970 --> 47:55.305
- How? When?
- Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

47:55.371 --> 47:58.186
She was swimming in the pool
in the YMCA when it happened.

47:58.252 --> 48:01.929
- She died mid-backstroke.
- I haven't seen her in, like, two years.

48:01.996 --> 48:04.997
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she
one of the illustrious 12?

48:05.069 --> 48:08.582
- Yeah, number six.
- You've had sex with a dead person.

48:08.653 --> 48:11.207
- I'm gonna go to her wake.
- No, you're not. It's today.

48:11.342 --> 48:14.212
- [Dante] What?
- [Randal] The next show's at 4:00.

48:14.286 --> 48:17.450
- [Dante] What about tomorrow?
- [Randal] She's buried in the morning.

48:17.518 --> 48:19.853
- You gotta watch the store. I gotta go.
- Wait.

48:19.919 --> 48:22.058
Has it occurred to you
I might be bereaved?

48:22.127 --> 48:23.208
You hardly knew her.

48:23.279 --> 48:25.582
True. Do you know how many people
will be there?

48:25.648 --> 48:28.496
- All her old classmates.
- This is beneath even you.

48:28.561 --> 48:31.529
I'm not gonna miss what's probably
the social event of the season.

48:31.602 --> 48:34.733
- You hate people!
- But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?

48:34.802 --> 48:37.453
Stop being an asshole.
Someone's gotta watch the store.

48:37.523 --> 48:39.530
- If you go, I go.
- She meant nothing to you!

48:39.602 --> 48:42.091
She meant nothing to you neither
'til I told you she died.

48:42.163 --> 48:44.019
- I'm not taking you.
- I'm going with you.

48:44.084 --> 48:47.532
- I can't close the store.
- You just closed the store to play hockey.

48:47.604 --> 48:51.402
Which means I can't close it for another
hour just so we can both go to a wake.

48:51.989 --> 48:53.331
You were saying?

48:53.397 --> 48:57.140
Thanks for putting me in
such a tough spot. You're a good friend.

48:58.806 --> 49:01.938
- She was pretty young, huh?
- Twenty- two. Just like us.

49:02.007 --> 49:05.619
- Embolism in a pool.
- What an embarrassing way to die.

49:05.687 --> 49:07.977
That's nothing compared to
how my cousin Walter died.

49:08.151 --> 49:09.151
How did he die?

49:09.209 --> 49:12.176
- He broke his neck.
- That's embarrassing?

49:12.248 --> 49:14.900
He broke his neck
trying to suck his own dick.

49:14.970 --> 49:16.977
- Shut the hell up.
- I swear.

49:17.049 --> 49:18.904
- Stop it.
- Bible truth.

49:18.969 --> 49:23.061
- Oh, my God!
- Haven't you ever tried to suck your dick?

49:23.131 --> 49:25.881
- No.
- Yeah, right. You're so repressed.

49:25.947 --> 49:29.395
- Because I never tried to suck my dick?
- No, because you won't admit to it.

49:29.468 --> 49:32.600
As if a guy's a fucking pervert
'cause he tries to go down on himself.

49:32.668 --> 49:35.319
You're as curious as the rest
of us, pal. You've tried it.

49:35.388 --> 49:38.204
- Who found him?
- My cousin? Mom found him.

49:38.269 --> 49:41.881
It was a mess. He was on his bed,
his legs doubled over himself.

49:41.950 --> 49:43.805
Mom freaked out.

49:43.871 --> 49:46.359
# You know that you are
A shooting star #

49:46.431 --> 49:49.879
- Made it, huh? Dick in his mouth?
- Yeah.

49:49.951 --> 49:52.602
Balls resting on his lips.

49:52.671 --> 49:56.120
- Wow. He really made it.
- Yeah, but at what a price.

49:58.593 --> 50:01.408
- I can never reach.
- Reach what?

50:01.473 --> 50:03.808
- You know.
- What, your dick?

50:03.874 --> 50:07.803
Yeah. Like you said, I guess everybody
gets curious and tries it sometime.

50:07.875 --> 50:09.730
I never tried it.

50:11.875 --> 50:13.730
Fucking pervert.

50:15.684 --> 50:19.962
# Suddenly everyone loved
To hear him play his songs

50:20.037 --> 50:25.024
# Watch the world go by
Surprising it goes so fast

50:25.094 --> 50:29.829
# Johnny looked around him and said
Hey, I've made the big time at last #

50:31.815 --> 50:35.111
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- Listen to you.

50:35.175 --> 50:38.951
I can't help it. At least on the roof,
I could see if anybody wanted to go in.

50:39.016 --> 50:41.023
Nobody's there.
It's 4:00 on a Saturday.

50:41.096 --> 50:43.780
How many people ever come to the store
at 4:00 on a Saturday?

50:45.514 --> 50:47.369
Let me in!

51:03.980 --> 51:05.923
[Crashing sound, woman screaming]

51:12.142 --> 51:15.525
# Do you know your place

51:15.823 --> 51:18.474
# In the big charade

51:18.543 --> 51:22.854
# Are you more than dead

51:23.025 --> 51:26.637
# Leaders and followers
Leaders and followers #

51:26.705 --> 51:28.975
- [door closes]
- I can't fucking believe you.

51:29.041 --> 51:30.896
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault.

51:30.961 --> 51:34.540
- You knocked the casket over!
- I was leanin' on it. It was an accident.

51:34.610 --> 51:36.814
Like someone knocks a casket over
on purpose!

51:36.882 --> 51:40.014
- So the casket fell over. Big deal.
- Her fucking body fell out!

51:40.083 --> 51:43.215
I put her back in it. It's not like
it matters if she breaks something.

51:43.284 --> 51:46.580
- Just go open the video store.
- [Jay] Open the video store!

51:46.644 --> 51:48.979
Shut the fuck up, junkie.

51:50.997 --> 51:54.642
- Would you just go open the video store?
- Yeah, you cock-smokin' clerk.

51:54.710 --> 51:57.558
How many times have I told you
not to deal in front of the store?

51:57.622 --> 51:59.379
I'm not.
What're you talking about?

51:59.447 --> 52:01.651
- Have you got anything, man?
- What you want?

52:04.248 --> 52:07.063
- Let me borrow your car.
- I don't want to talk to you.

52:07.128 --> 52:10.424
- Fine. Just let me borrow your car.
- Why should I loan you my car?

52:10.488 --> 52:12.660
- I want to rent a movie.
- You want to rent a movie.

52:12.729 --> 52:13.777
I want to rent a movie.

52:13.849 --> 52:15.224
- [Sighs]
- What's that for?

52:15.289 --> 52:18.770
- You work in a video store!
- I work in a shitty video store.

52:18.842 --> 52:22.902
I want to go to a good video store
so I can get a good movie.

52:24.027 --> 52:26.034
And a pack of cigarettes.

52:26.107 --> 52:28.977
- Cute cat. What's its name?
- Annoying customer.

52:29.052 --> 52:30.907
Fucking dickhead.

52:33.309 --> 52:36.124
Can you imagine being halfway decent
to the customers?

52:36.190 --> 52:38.524
- Let me borrow your car.
- May I be blunt with you?

52:38.589 --> 52:39.589
If you must.

52:39.614 --> 52:43.324
We are employees of Quick Stop
Convenience and RST Video, respectively.

52:43.390 --> 52:46.620
We have obligations that, although
they may seem cruel and unusual,

52:46.687 --> 52:49.405
- mean manning the store until closing.
- I see.

52:49.472 --> 52:52.920
So playing hockey and attending wakes
are standard operating procedures?

52:52.992 --> 52:57.248
Those are obligations that couldn't
have been met at any other date.

52:57.313 --> 53:01.886
Renting videos, that's gratuitous, and
illogical, since you work at a video store.

53:01.954 --> 53:03.809
- Are you open?
- Yes.

53:03.874 --> 53:05.500
I don't care for your rationale.

53:05.570 --> 53:08.288
It's gonna have to do,
being it's my car up for request.

53:08.355 --> 53:10.526
- Can I help you?
- A pack of cigarettes.

53:10.596 --> 53:14.044
- What's your point?
- You're a clerk, paid to do a job.

53:14.116 --> 53:17.499
You can't just do anything
you want while you're working.

53:17.573 --> 53:21.436
"Space alien revealed
as head of Time-Warner.

53:21.509 --> 53:24.412
Report stock increase".

53:24.486 --> 53:27.105
They print any kind of shit
in this paper.

53:27.175 --> 53:29.030
They certainly do.
Three dollars.

53:29.095 --> 53:31.484
- Your argument is title dictates behavior.
- What?

53:31.559 --> 53:34.789
You won't let me use your car
because I have a title and job description.

53:34.856 --> 53:37.028
- I'm supposed to follow it, right?
- Exactly.

53:37.097 --> 53:40.326
I saw one one time that said,

53:40.393 --> 53:42.946
"The next week,
the world is ending".

53:43.017 --> 53:45.352
In the next week's paper, they said,

53:45.418 --> 53:48.069
"We were miraculously saved
at the zero hour

53:48.138 --> 53:51.434
by a koala-fish mutant bird".

53:51.499 --> 53:52.612
[Laughing]
Crazy shit.

53:52.683 --> 53:57.256
I'm no more responsible for my decisions
here than a death squad soldier in Bosnia?

53:57.324 --> 54:00.226
You're not being asked to slay children
or anything.

54:00.300 --> 54:02.788
- Yeah, not yet.
- And I remember one time...

54:04.813 --> 54:07.596
I'm gonna break your fucking head,
you fucking jerk!

54:07.662 --> 54:10.150
- I'm sorry. He meant to hit me.
- Well, he missed.

54:10.222 --> 54:13.037
Here, let me refund your money
and we'll call it even.

54:13.103 --> 54:15.045
I'll never come in here again.

54:15.119 --> 54:20.008
And if I see you again,
I'm gonna break your fucking head open!

54:22.640 --> 54:24.812
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- Two reasons.

54:24.881 --> 54:28.591
One, I hate it when people can't shut up
about the stupid tabloid headlines.

54:28.657 --> 54:32.007
And two, to prove a point.
Title does not dictate behavior.

54:32.082 --> 54:35.378
- What?
- If title dictated my behavior as a clerk

54:35.443 --> 54:38.258
I wouldn't be allowed to spit water
at that guy, but I did.

54:38.323 --> 54:40.812
My point is that people
dictate their own behavior.

54:40.883 --> 54:44.179
Even though I work in a video store,
I choose to rent movies at Big Choice.

54:44.245 --> 54:45.455
Agreed?

54:45.524 --> 54:47.434
You are a danger
to the dead and the living.

54:47.509 --> 54:49.843
I like to think
I'm a master of my own destiny.

54:49.910 --> 54:52.812
- Please get the hell outta here.
- You know I'm your hero.

54:58.327 --> 55:00.596
Sounds like somebody
needs to hit the gym.

55:00.663 --> 55:01.663
Excuse me?

55:01.688 --> 55:03.630
You strained
when you picked up that milk.

55:03.704 --> 55:06.574
- It only weighs seven pounds.
- I didn't strain. I sighed.

55:06.648 --> 55:08.852
I don't think so.
That was a grunt.

55:08.920 --> 55:12.270
A deep inhalation of oxygen
to aid in the stretching of muscles.

55:12.346 --> 55:16.340
I'm a trainer. I know what that
sound signifies. You're out of shape.

55:16.410 --> 55:19.509
- What? There's no fat on my body.
- No fat!

55:19.579 --> 55:21.881
No tone either.
You don't get enough exercise.

55:21.947 --> 55:23.890
- You open?
- Yes.

55:23.964 --> 55:26.550
- Just the paper.
- Thirty-five.

55:26.620 --> 55:30.133
Hey, uh, let me ask you a question.
Think this guy's out of shape?

55:30.204 --> 55:32.059
Can't really tell from here.

55:32.125 --> 55:34.842
- He is.
- I am not!

55:34.909 --> 55:36.764
How much can you bench?

55:36.830 --> 55:39.677
- I don't know.
- I'd say about 60, 70, tops.

55:39.743 --> 55:41.598
I know I can bench more than that.

55:41.663 --> 55:44.314
- Three-fifty, four.
- No way!

55:44.383 --> 55:46.239
Feel that.

55:46.304 --> 55:49.054
Hey, that's tight.
Solid.

55:49.120 --> 55:51.225
Now feel this.
Roll up your sleeve, chief.

55:51.296 --> 55:53.718
- Oh, for God's sakes!
- See, you're ashamed.

55:53.793 --> 55:55.135
You know you're out of shape.

55:55.201 --> 55:57.176
Here.
Take my card.

55:57.249 --> 55:59.551
I can get you on an aerobics,
free weights program.

55:59.618 --> 56:02.466
- Are you open?
- [Dante] Yes. I'm not out of shape.

56:02.531 --> 56:04.386
Excuse me.
Have you been here all day?

56:04.451 --> 56:07.452
- Yeah, since 6:00 this morning.
- He's got those love handles.

56:07.523 --> 56:09.379
I don't have love handles!

56:09.444 --> 56:11.549
- Were you working here about 4:00?
- Yes.

56:11.620 --> 56:14.468
- It's from being around this food every day.
- Oh, I know.

56:14.532 --> 56:17.948
If I had to work here all day,
I'd be bloated and out of shape too.

56:18.021 --> 56:20.640
- I'm not out of shape.
- Can I have your name, please?

56:20.710 --> 56:22.979
Dante Hicks. Why?
What's this all about?

56:23.046 --> 56:27.008
You're Dante Hicks? Oh, my God.
I didn't even recognize you.

56:27.079 --> 56:29.468
- Because he's out of shape!
- Do I know you?

56:29.543 --> 56:31.999
Do you remember Alyssa Jones?
She used to hang out...

56:32.072 --> 56:33.795
- With Caitlin Bree!
- I'm her sister.

56:33.864 --> 56:35.720
You're Alyssa's sister Heather?

56:35.785 --> 56:37.825
- Yeah.
- You, uh, say Caitlin Bree?

56:37.897 --> 56:39.872
- Yeah.
- Pretty girl?

56:39.945 --> 56:42.367
A little taller than her?
Gorgeous body?

56:42.442 --> 56:44.351
- Yeah.
- And you're Dante Hicks.

56:44.426 --> 56:46.369
You went to the same school,
played hockey.

56:46.443 --> 56:48.996
- How did you know that?
- You still goin' out with her?

56:49.067 --> 56:51.140
- No, she's getting married.
- To you?

56:51.211 --> 56:53.099
No. To an Asian design major.

56:53.164 --> 56:55.019
Aw, shit!

56:55.084 --> 56:58.249
Don't take this the wrong way,
but, uh, I used to fuck her.

56:58.317 --> 57:00.684
- What?
- Yeah, about two, three years ago.

57:00.749 --> 57:03.433
While you two were dating.
I drove a black Trans Am.

57:03.501 --> 57:05.444
- You're Rick Derris?
- Yeah.

57:05.518 --> 57:07.373
- You know him?
- Yeah.

57:07.438 --> 57:09.860
- Caitlin talked about him all the time.
- Really?

57:09.935 --> 57:13.864
Wait a second. You used to fuck
Caitlin Bree while I was dating her?

57:13.936 --> 57:16.587
Don't let it bother you.
That was a long time ago.

57:16.656 --> 57:18.860
I'm surprised you didn't
know about it.

57:18.928 --> 57:21.449
Everybody in school knew about it.
Even in my class.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.409
Jesus Christ! What next?

57:23.473 --> 57:25.328
- Here you go.
- What's this?

57:25.393 --> 57:27.084
- A fine for $500.
- What?

57:27.154 --> 57:29.041
Five hundred bucks?
For what?

57:29.106 --> 57:33.514
For violation of New Jersey Statute,
Section 2A, Number 170l51.

57:33.587 --> 57:36.075
Any person who sells
or makes available tobacco,

57:36.147 --> 57:39.563
or tobacco-related products,
to persons under the age of 18,

57:39.636 --> 57:40.880
is regarded as disorderly.

57:40.948 --> 57:45.105
- What are you talkin' about?
- An angry mother called the state

57:45.173 --> 57:47.061
and claimed
that a Quick Stop employee

57:47.125 --> 57:50.093
sold her four-year-old daughter
a pack of cigarettes today.

57:50.166 --> 57:52.916
The Division of Taxation
called the Board of Health

57:52.982 --> 57:54.837
and sent me down to issue a fine.

57:54.903 --> 57:58.286
You claimed you were working here
all day. Hence, the fine is yours.

57:58.360 --> 58:00.749
The fine is doubled
due to the young age of the child.

58:00.824 --> 58:02.864
But I didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids!

58:02.936 --> 58:05.806
You sold cigarettes to a four-year-old?
What a scumbag!

58:05.881 --> 58:07.888
That's sick, Dante.

58:07.961 --> 58:10.100
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I swear!

58:10.169 --> 58:11.697
The due date is on the bottom.

58:11.769 --> 58:14.803
This summons cannot be contested
in any court of law.

58:14.874 --> 58:18.552
Failure to remit will result
in a charge of criminal negligence,

58:18.619 --> 58:20.692
and a warrant
will be issued for your arrest.

58:20.763 --> 58:22.105
Have a nice day.

58:22.171 --> 58:26.427
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids.
Hey, wait a minute!

58:26.492 --> 58:30.868
Forget it. I don't wanna deal with a guy
that sells cigarettes to four-year-olds.

58:30.941 --> 58:33.145
Can I, uh, give you
a lift somewhere?

58:33.214 --> 58:35.996
Sure. How 'bout the beach?

58:36.062 --> 58:37.918
I like the way you think.

58:42.591 --> 58:44.446
Jesus! What next?

58:44.511 --> 58:47.861
- [Woman] Dante?
- What? Caitlin!

58:47.937 --> 58:51.963
[# Muzak]

59:09.508 --> 59:11.396

- Just now.

59:11.460 --> 59:14.178
I can't believe it.
I haven't seen you in so long.

59:16.230 --> 59:18.237
Dante, you have a customer.

59:21.702 --> 59:23.939
I just saw Alyssa's
little sister outside.

59:24.007 --> 59:26.855
- She was with Rick Derris.
- Let's not talk about her.

59:26.919 --> 59:29.341
- How'd you get home?
- Train. It took eight hours.

59:29.416 --> 59:31.805
- I can't believe you're here.
- Excuse me. Do you...

59:31.880 --> 59:33.986
Back behind the oil.
How long you staying?

59:34.057 --> 59:36.926
Until Monday.
Then I have to take the train back.

59:37.001 --> 59:39.009
Pack of cigarettes.
Congratulations.

59:39.082 --> 59:40.937
I saw the announcement
in today's paper.

59:41.002 --> 59:42.791
She's marrying
an Asian design major.

59:42.858 --> 59:44.746
So I'm told.

the store?

I wanna talk to you,
and I don't wanna be disturbed.

01:00:17.233 --> 01:00:19.175
Something I read in the tabloids.

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:21.159
- You saw it.
- Very dramatic, I thought.

01:00:21.233 --> 01:00:23.273
- It's not what you think.
- Oh, it's not.

01:00:23.346 --> 01:00:26.096
What? You're pregnant
with the Asian design major's child?

01:00:26.162 --> 01:00:28.072
- What's goin' on here?
- I am not pregnant.

01:00:28.147 --> 01:00:30.635
Were you gonna tell me,
or send me an invitation?

01:00:30.707 --> 01:00:33.522
I was gonna tell you,
but we were getting along so well.

01:00:33.587 --> 01:00:35.148
You could've broken it gently.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.603
You could've told me you had a boyfriend.
I told you I had a girlfriend.

01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:42.539
I'm sorry, but when we started talking,
it was like I forgot I had a boyfriend.

01:00:42.612 --> 01:00:44.915
- And then he proposed last month.
- You said yes.

01:00:44.981 --> 01:00:46.836
Well, kind of. Sort of.

01:00:46.901 --> 01:00:49.585
Is that what they teach you in school?
"Kind of," "sort of"?

01:00:49.654 --> 01:00:52.273
Everybody knows!
Do you know how humiliating that is?

01:00:52.343 --> 01:00:55.158
I would've told you,
and you would've stopped calling me.

01:00:55.223 --> 01:00:57.111
- How do you know that?
- I know you.

01:00:57.175 --> 01:00:59.761
You prefer drastic measures
to rational ones.

- No.

- You're not really getting married?

01:01:04.377 --> 01:01:08.534
The story goes like this: He proposed,
I told him I had to think about it,

01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:10.576
and he insisted
that I wear the ring.

01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:13.018
Then my mother told the paper
we were engaged.

01:01:13.082 --> 01:01:15.417
- I don't like her.
- Then my mother called

01:01:15.483 --> 01:01:17.850
to let me know the announcement
was in the paper.

01:01:17.915 --> 01:01:20.916
I hopped a train to come here,
because I knew you'd be a wreck.

01:01:20.988 --> 01:01:23.509
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Was I right?

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.436
"Wreck" is a harsh term.

01:01:25.501 --> 01:01:27.770
"Disturbed" is more like it.
"Mildly disturbed".

01:01:27.837 --> 01:01:30.936
I love a macho facade.
It is such a turn-on.

01:01:31.006 --> 01:01:34.716
- What smells like shoe polish?
- So you came here to comfort me?

01:01:34.782 --> 01:01:37.849
The last thing I needed was
for you to think I was hiding something.

01:01:37.919 --> 01:01:40.024
- But you were!
- No, I wasn't! Not really.

01:01:40.095 --> 01:01:41.884
I told you
I'd been seeing other people.

01:01:41.951 --> 01:01:44.407
But not seriously.
You're ready to walk down the aisle.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.968
That constitutes something
more than seeing somebody.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.943
- What's going on?
- I'm giving him his ring back.

01:01:50.017 --> 01:01:52.352
- What?
- [Sighs] I don't want to marry him.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:55.265
I don't want to get married now.
I'm on the verge of graduation.

01:01:55.329 --> 01:01:58.646
I want to go to grad school after this,
and then I want to start a career.

01:01:58.722 --> 01:01:59.802
I don't want to be a wife

01:01:59.874 --> 01:02:02.624
and then worry about
when I'm gonna fit in the other stuff.

01:02:02.691 --> 01:02:04.830
I have come way too far
and studied too damn hard

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.315
to let my education
go to waste as a housewife.

01:02:08.388 --> 01:02:10.243
And I know
that's what I'd become.

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:13.790
Sang's just signed with a major firm,
and he's gonna pull in a huge salary,

01:02:13.861 --> 01:02:16.001
which would give me
no reason to work.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.925
- He's very traditional.
- Wait a minute.

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:21.220
- His name is "Sang"? Past tense?
- Stop it. He's a nice guy.

01:02:21.287 --> 01:02:23.775
Well, if he's so nice,
why aren't you marrying him?

01:02:23.847 --> 01:02:26.881
- I just told you.
- There's more to this, isn't there?

- You lie!
- Look how full of yourself you are!

I believe in giving credit
where it's due.

01:02:36.873 --> 01:02:39.208
I believe I'm the impetus
behind your refusal to wed.

01:02:39.274 --> 01:02:43.137
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I
having sex with an Asian design major?

01:02:43.211 --> 01:02:45.316
Oh, Jesus. You're so caustic.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.908
I had to knock you down
from that cloud you were on.

I mean that.

Not for years.

they'd love that.

We can introduce them.
They may hit it off.

You're serious?
You wanna date again?

01:03:07.407 --> 01:03:09.262
I wanna be your boyfriend, yes.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.749
It's just the shock of seeing me
after three years.

- Believe me, you'll get over it.
- Give me a bit more credit.

01:03:14.704 --> 01:03:16.560

we got back together.

You're finishing college.

- You work in a market.

01:03:22.322 --> 01:03:24.427
Tell me you wouldn't
wanna go out with me again

01:03:24.498 --> 01:03:27.597
- after all the talking we've done.
- The key word here is "talk".

01:03:27.666 --> 01:03:30.384
I think the idea,
or the conception of us dating,

01:03:30.451 --> 01:03:33.201
is a lot more idyllic than
what actually happens when we date.

01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:36.082
What are we supposed to do?
Pretend over the phone we're dating?

01:03:36.148 --> 01:03:38.482
I don't know.
Maybe we should just see what happens.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:40.753

- On a date?

01:03:40.821 --> 01:03:43.243

- He's your fiancé.

- Where is he, anyway?

01:08:10.534 --> 01:08:13.698
Something inside of me says
it's time to give him a serious try.

01:08:13.766 --> 01:08:16.930
Wow. Hey, you know, you and I
have something in common.

01:08:16.999 --> 01:08:19.332
- We both eat Chinese.
- Dick.

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:21.603
- Exactly.
- So where is he?

01:08:21.671 --> 01:08:23.581
He went home to change
for the big date.

01:08:23.656 --> 01:08:26.689
- God, isn't he great?
- No. This is great.

01:08:26.761 --> 01:08:29.314
Oh, lord.
Can I use your bathroom?

01:08:29.385 --> 01:08:31.872
- There's no lights.
- Why aren't there any?

01:08:31.944 --> 01:08:34.912
There are, but for some reason
they stop working at 5:14.

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:37.189
- You're kidding.
- Nobody can figure it out.

01:08:37.258 --> 01:08:39.430
The boss doesn't want
to pay the electrician

01:08:39.499 --> 01:08:41.572
because he owes money
to the video store.

01:08:41.643 --> 01:08:44.709
- Such a sordid state of affairs.
- And I'm caught in the middle,

01:08:44.779 --> 01:08:48.555
torn between my loyalty for the boss
and my desire to piss with lights on.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.792
Well, I'll try to manage.

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:54.822
Oh, hey, Caitlin? Break his heart
again this time, and I'll kill you.

01:08:54.893 --> 01:08:56.420
Nothing personal.

01:08:56.493 --> 01:08:59.625
You are very protective of him, Randal.
You always have been.

01:08:59.694 --> 01:09:02.247
Territoriality.
He was mine first.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.741
Oh, that was so cute.

01:09:05.647 --> 01:09:07.535

01:09:11.216 --> 01:09:13.191

Who eats cock?

01:09:18.098 --> 01:09:20.073
Bunch of savages in this town.

01:09:20.145 --> 01:09:22.001
Caitlin's in the back.
Check on her.

01:09:22.066 --> 01:09:24.881
- She's been back there a long time.
- There are no lights.

01:09:24.946 --> 01:09:27.532
I told her that.
She said she didn't need any.

01:09:27.603 --> 01:09:30.419
Why don't you go join her?
Make a little bathroom bam-bam.

01:09:30.484 --> 01:09:32.720
I love your sexy talk.
It's so kindergarten.

01:09:32.787 --> 01:09:34.828
- Poo-poo, wee-wee.
- Fuck you.

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:36.884

01:09:39.478 --> 01:09:41.332
[Man on video] I said stop.

01:09:41.398 --> 01:09:45.676
- [Woman] Oh, God.
- [Man] It's all about pain, you bastard!

01:09:45.751 --> 01:09:48.020
[Woman moaning on video]

01:09:48.086 --> 01:09:49.974
How did you get here so fast?

01:09:50.038 --> 01:09:52.211
I left like an hour ago.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:55.662
Do you always talk this weird
after you violate a woman?

01:09:55.736 --> 01:09:58.224
Maybe the Asian design major
slipped her some opium.

01:09:58.296 --> 01:10:02.258
- Could be.
- It has never been like that before.

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:04.054
Like what?

01:10:04.122 --> 01:10:07.418
When you just lay perfectly still
and let me do everything.

01:10:07.483 --> 01:10:10.931
- Am I missing something here?
- OK.

01:10:11.003 --> 01:10:13.589
I went back and Dante
was already waiting for me.

01:10:13.659 --> 01:10:16.409
- He was?
- It was so cool.

01:10:16.476 --> 01:10:18.778
He didn't say a word.
He didn't have to.

01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:22.328
He was just ready.

01:10:22.398 --> 01:10:25.398
You know. And, like,
we didn't kiss or talk or anything.

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:27.805
He just sat there
and let me do all the work.

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:30.205
You dog.
I didn't even see you go back there.

01:10:30.271 --> 01:10:33.403
The fact that there
weren't any lights on made it so...

01:10:33.471 --> 01:10:35.326
God, that was so great!

01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:37.464
My legs are still shaking.

01:10:39.296 --> 01:10:41.533
- It wasn't me.
- [Scoffs]

01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:43.936
Yeah, right.
Who was it, then? Randal?

01:10:44.001 --> 01:10:46.173
- Was it you?
- I was up here the whole time.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:49.242
- You two better quit it.
- I'm serious.

01:10:49.314 --> 01:10:51.736
Oh, so we didn't
just have sex in the bathroom?

01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:53.752
No.

01:10:56.708 --> 01:10:58.563
Stop it.
This isn't funny.

01:10:58.628 --> 01:11:01.443
I'm not fooling around.
I just came in from outside.

01:11:01.509 --> 01:11:03.931
- This isn't fucking funny.
- I'm not kidding.

01:11:04.004 --> 01:11:05.979
- Who went back there?
- Nobody. I swear.

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:08.443
- I feel nauseous.
- Sure there was someone there?

01:11:08.518 --> 01:11:10.820
Well, I didn't just fuck myself!
Jesus Christ!

01:11:10.886 --> 01:11:13.221
- I'm gonna be sick.
- You just fucked a stranger?

01:11:13.287 --> 01:11:15.142
- Shut up.
- I can't believe this.

01:11:15.207 --> 01:11:17.062
- Call the police.
- No, don't!

01:11:17.127 --> 01:11:18.983
A stranger just raped Caitlin.

01:11:19.048 --> 01:11:21.437
- She did all the work.
- Will you shut the fuck up?

01:11:21.512 --> 01:11:23.716
Who the fuck's in our bathroom?

01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:26.656
[Woman]
Who is he?

01:11:26.729 --> 01:11:29.763
[Dante] I don't know. He came in
and asked to use the bathroom.

01:11:29.833 --> 01:11:31.721
- What time was this?
- I don't know.

01:11:31.785 --> 01:11:33.673
What time did hockey end?

01:11:33.738 --> 01:11:35.593
Um, like 3:00, 3:30.

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:38.342
- What time we get back from the funeral?
- 4:00, I think.

01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:40.680
- Wait. Who was working here?
- Just me.

01:11:40.747 --> 01:11:43.562
You said you went to play hockey
and then went to a funeral.

01:11:43.628 --> 01:11:45.962
- Yeah, we did.
- Who was operating the store?

01:11:46.029 --> 01:11:48.844
- Nobody. It was closed.
- With this guy locked in here?

01:11:48.909 --> 01:11:52.106
Everything happened quickly,
I guess I forgot he was back there.

01:11:52.301 --> 01:11:54.636
- [Man] Can we take it now?
- Go ahead.

01:11:59.919 --> 01:12:02.024
Was he alive when Caitlin...

01:12:02.095 --> 01:12:04.551
No. I place the time
of death about 3:20.

01:12:04.624 --> 01:12:07.472
Then how could she... you know.

01:12:07.536 --> 01:12:10.700
[Coroner] The body can maintain
erection after expiration for hours.

01:12:10.769 --> 01:12:12.776
Did he have the adult magazine
when he came in?

01:12:12.849 --> 01:12:16.974
No, I gave it to him.
He asked me for it.

01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:20.817
I can't say for certain,
but my guess is he was masturbating,

01:12:20.882 --> 01:12:23.698
his heart seized and he died.
That's when the girl found him.

01:12:23.763 --> 01:12:26.251
[Sniffing]
Something smells like shoe polish.

01:12:26.323 --> 01:12:29.455
This has got to be the weirdest thing
you've ever been called in on.

01:12:29.524 --> 01:12:34.064
I had to tag a kid that broke his neck
trying to put his mouth on his penis.

01:12:34.133 --> 01:12:35.988
What about Caitlin?

01:12:36.053 --> 01:12:39.153
[Coroner] Shock trauma.
She's gonna need years of therapy.

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:42.354
My question is, how did she come
to have sex with a dead man?

01:12:42.423 --> 01:12:44.943
She thought it was me.

01:12:45.014 --> 01:12:47.982
What kind of convenience store
do you run here?

said anything for 20 minutes.

01:13:29.567 --> 01:13:31.291
What the hell's your problem?

- [Sighs] This life.
- This life?

01:13:33.247 --> 01:13:35.517
Why do I have this life?

01:13:35.584 --> 01:13:37.439
Have some chips.
You'll feel better.

01:13:37.504 --> 01:13:41.018

don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.

- Yeah.

This thing you have, this inability
to improve your station in life.

01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:18.752
- Fuck you.
- It's true, man.

01:14:18.824 --> 01:14:21.312
You blame life for dealing you
a cruddy hand,

01:14:21.384 --> 01:14:24.101
never once accepting
responsibility for your situation.

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:27.365
- What responsibility?
- If you hate this job and the people...

01:14:27.433 --> 01:14:30.663
and the fact that you have to
come in on your day off, why not quit?

01:14:30.729 --> 01:14:33.218
- Like it's that easy.
- It is. You just up and quit.

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:35.593
There's other jobs.
They pay better money.

01:14:35.659 --> 01:14:38.823
You're qualified for at least one.
So what's stopping you?

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:40.899
- Leave me alone.
- You're comfortable?

01:14:40.972 --> 01:14:43.689
This is a life of convenience
and any attempt to change it

01:14:43.756 --> 01:14:47.052
would shatter the pathetic microcosm
you've fashioned for yourself.

01:14:47.117 --> 01:14:48.546
Like your life's any better.

01:14:48.621 --> 01:14:53.575
I'm satisfied with my situation for now.
You have been bitching all day.

01:14:53.646 --> 01:14:55.785
Thank you.
Go back to the video store.

01:14:55.854 --> 01:14:57.796
- Same with Veronica.
- Leave her out.

01:14:57.870 --> 01:15:01.416
You date Veronica because it's
convenient and she's low maintenance.

01:15:01.487 --> 01:15:03.276
But all you do is talk about Caitlin.

01:15:03.344 --> 01:15:05.766
You carry a torch for a girl
you dated in high school.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.045
High school, for God's sakes.
You're 22.

01:15:08.113 --> 01:15:11.496
- Leave me alone.
- If you want Caitlin, be with Caitlin.

If you want Veronica,
then be with Veronica.

01:15:14.034 --> 01:15:16.139
But don't pine for one
and fuck the other.

Man, if you weren't
such a fucking coward...

01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:20.109
If I wasn't such a fucking coward.

01:15:20.179 --> 01:15:23.245
It must be great to have
this ability to simplify things.

01:15:23.315 --> 01:15:25.170
- Am I right or what?
- You're wrong.

01:15:25.236 --> 01:15:28.532
Things happened today
that ruined my chances with Caitlin.

01:15:28.596 --> 01:15:31.760
Oh, what, the dead guy?
She'll get over fucking a dead guy.

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:35.473
Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy
for 30 years. I call him Dad.

01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:37.778
Caitlin and I can't be together.
It's impossible.

01:15:37.845 --> 01:15:41.326
Melodrama coming from you seems
as natural as an oral bowel movement.

01:15:41.398 --> 01:15:44.530
What do you want me to say?
"Yes, some things you say are true"?

01:15:44.599 --> 01:15:46.574
Things are not going to change.

01:15:46.647 --> 01:15:49.069
- Make 'em change.
- I can't, all right?

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:50.705
Jesus, will you leave me alone?

01:15:50.777 --> 01:15:53.712
I can't make changes in my life
like that. If I could, I would.

01:15:53.785 --> 01:15:56.687
But I don't have the ability
to risk the comfortable situations

01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:58.517
on the big money and fabulous prizes.

01:15:58.586 --> 01:16:01.935
- Who are you kidding? You can so.
- Jesus H. Christ! I can't.

01:16:02.010 --> 01:16:06.615
So you're gonna be miserable 'cause
you don't have the guts to face change?

01:16:06.683 --> 01:16:10.164
My mother told me once
that when I was three years old,

01:16:10.235 --> 01:16:11.642
my potty lid was closed,

01:16:11.708 --> 01:16:14.610
and instead of me lifting it,
I shit my pants.

01:16:14.684 --> 01:16:16.375
Lovely story.

01:16:16.445 --> 01:16:18.649
The point is,
I'm not the type of person

01:16:18.718 --> 01:16:22.035
who'll disrupt things
just so I can shit comfortably.

01:16:35.041 --> 01:16:38.390

01:16:45.218 --> 01:16:48.186

- Hell, yes, whatever that means.

01:16:48.258 --> 01:16:51.009
Now it's time to head over to Atlantic,
drink some beers,

01:16:51.075 --> 01:16:52.897
get ripped and, hopefully, get laid.

01:16:52.963 --> 01:16:56.379
- [Dante] $1.79.
- Pay the good man.

01:16:56.452 --> 01:16:58.841
- Yeah, you close soon?
- In half an hour.

01:16:58.916 --> 01:17:00.510
We get off the same time every day.

01:17:00.581 --> 01:17:03.199
- We should hang out. You get high?
- I should start.

01:17:03.269 --> 01:17:06.466
Wanna come to this party?
There's gonna be some pussy.

01:17:06.533 --> 01:17:10.625
- With you? I don't think so.
- "I don't hang out with drug dealers".

01:17:10.694 --> 01:17:13.412
- Nothing personal.
- What happened with that old guy?

01:17:13.479 --> 01:17:16.676
- He died in the bathroom.
- I heard he was jerkin' off.

01:17:16.743 --> 01:17:18.784
I don't know.
I wasn't watching.

01:17:18.856 --> 01:17:22.173
He saw that Caitlin chick. I know
I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.

01:17:22.248 --> 01:17:24.191
Come here, bitch.
You like this? Huh?

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.054
- This what you want?
- Knock it off.

01:17:26.122 --> 01:17:29.221
- That used to be my girlfriend.
- Oh, you used to go out with her?

01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:31.461
I thought we might
be starting again.

01:17:31.531 --> 01:17:34.946
- Don't you already have a girlfriend?
- [Dante] Yeah, Veronica.

01:17:35.019 --> 01:17:38.118
- You're gonna dump her for Caitlin?
- Maybe.

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:39.268
I don't know, dude.

01:17:39.339 --> 01:17:42.569
Caitlin's nice, but I see Veronica
doing shit for you all the time.

01:17:42.636 --> 01:17:45.354
I saw her rubbing your back,
brings your food.

01:17:45.421 --> 01:17:47.363
Didn't I see her change your tire once?

01:17:47.437 --> 01:17:51.147
I jacked up the car. All she did was
unloosen the nuts and put the tire on.

01:17:51.214 --> 01:17:54.629
- All I know is she does a lot for you.
- She's my girlfriend.

01:17:54.702 --> 01:17:58.827
I had some girlfriends too, but all
they wanted from me was weed and shit.

01:17:58.895 --> 01:18:01.164
My grandmother would say,
"What's better?

01:18:01.232 --> 01:18:04.047
A good plate with nothing on it?"
No, wait. I fucked up.

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:06.120
"What's a good plate
with nothing on it?"

01:18:06.193 --> 01:18:09.008
- Meaning?
- I don't know. She was senile.

01:18:09.073 --> 01:18:13.035
She used to fuckin' piss herself
all the time, and shit herself.

01:18:13.106 --> 01:18:16.903
Come on, Silent Bob.
Let's get out of this fuckin' gyp joint

01:18:16.978 --> 01:18:20.077
with this fuckin' faggot Dante.
You cock smoker.

01:18:21.427 --> 01:18:24.297
There's a million fine-lookin' women
in the world, dude,

01:18:24.372 --> 01:18:28.650
but they don't all bring you lasagna
at work. Most just cheat on you.

01:18:28.725 --> 01:18:30.416
[Jay]
Come on, limp dick!

01:18:30.485 --> 01:18:32.907
[Silent Bob]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:34.261 --> 01:18:36.171
He's right.

01:18:36.246 --> 01:18:38.701
I love her.

01:18:38.999 --> 01:18:42.545
That's it. He doesn't love you anymore.
He loves Caitlin.

01:18:42.615 --> 01:18:44.623
And he told you all of this?

01:18:44.695 --> 01:18:48.820
Pretty much. All except the latent
homosexuality part. That's my theory.

01:18:48.888 --> 01:18:51.158
I don't know what to say.

01:18:51.225 --> 01:18:54.935
Don't hold it against him. He just
never got Caitlin out of his system.

01:18:55.001 --> 01:18:57.904
It's not your fault.
It's Dante.

01:18:58.522 --> 01:19:00.824
Look. I don't know thing one
about chicks.

01:19:00.891 --> 01:19:03.739
So if you gotta cry or something,
I can get out of here.

01:19:03.803 --> 01:19:06.105
- I'm not sad.
- You're not?

01:19:06.171 --> 01:19:07.797
What did you do that for?

01:19:07.867 --> 01:19:10.901
If you didn't wanna go out with me,
why didn't you say so?

01:19:10.972 --> 01:19:13.340
Instead you pussyfoot around
and see that slut!

01:19:13.405 --> 01:19:15.576
- What?
- You've been talking to her for weeks!

01:19:15.645 --> 01:19:16.726
Only a few times.

01:19:16.797 --> 01:19:19.734
Then you freak out because
I've gone down on a couple of guys.

01:19:19.834 --> 01:19:20.883
Oh, a couple?

01:19:20.958 --> 01:19:25.115
I'm not trying to patch up with my ex,
sneaking around behind your back!

01:19:25.183 --> 01:19:27.071
If you think 37 dicks are a lot,
just wait.

01:19:27.135 --> 01:19:30.397
I'm going to put the hookers
in Times Square to shame!

01:19:30.463 --> 01:19:32.154
- Will you let me explain?
- What?

01:19:32.224 --> 01:19:36.086
How you've been waiting until the time
was right to dump me for her?

01:19:36.161 --> 01:19:38.169
- It isn't like that!
- Damn right!

01:19:38.241 --> 01:19:41.470
I won't let it be like that.
You want your slut? Fine.

01:19:41.538 --> 01:19:43.960
- I don't want Caitlin.
- You don't know what you want!

01:19:44.034 --> 01:19:47.166
But I'm not going to hold your hand
anymore until you figure it out!

01:19:47.234 --> 01:19:48.729
I've tried with you, Dante.

01:19:48.803 --> 01:19:52.251
I've encouraged you to get out of this
fucking dump and go back to school,

01:19:52.324 --> 01:19:54.113
to take charge and find direction.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:57.563
I transferred so maybe you'd be more
inclined to go back if I was with you.

01:19:57.637 --> 01:20:00.954
Everyone said it was a stupid move,
but I didn't care because I loved you

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:03.363
and wanted to see you
pull yourself out of this funk

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:06.464
that you've been in since that whore
dumped you so many years ago.

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:08.869
You wanna go back to her
so she can fuck you over more!

01:20:08.935 --> 01:20:11.074
- I don't wanna go back...
- Of course. Not now.

01:20:11.143 --> 01:20:13.991
You're caught,
and now you're trying to snake out.

01:20:14.056 --> 01:20:18.180
I want you to follow through so you
can find out what an idiot you are.

01:20:18.249 --> 01:20:20.900
And when she dumps you again,
and I promise you, she will,

01:20:20.969 --> 01:20:23.555
when she dumps you again
I want to laugh in your face

01:20:23.625 --> 01:20:26.625
so you realize what you gave up
our relationship for.

01:20:26.698 --> 01:20:29.416
I'm glad Randal had the balls
to tell me since you couldn't.

01:20:29.482 --> 01:20:32.831
Having him tell me was
the weakest move ever. You're spineless.

01:20:32.907 --> 01:20:36.006
- Veronica, I love you.
- Fuck you!

01:20:36.748 --> 01:20:39.618
[Gong ringing]

01:20:50.894 --> 01:20:52.750
Dante?

01:20:54.735 --> 01:20:58.249
# Our problems seem a world away

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.350
# Close your eyes

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:04.174
# And they'll all go away

01:21:04.241 --> 01:21:08.715
# Close the night and listen

01:21:08.786 --> 01:21:12.747
# Close your eyes to me

01:21:12.818 --> 01:21:15.153
# And sell the lie

01:21:15.218 --> 01:21:17.739
# My face

01:21:17.811 --> 01:21:20.266
# Shall live

01:21:20.339 --> 01:21:22.991
# You'll all be replaced #

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:25.264
How's your eye?

01:21:25.332 --> 01:21:28.431
The swelling's not that bad,
but the F.D.S. Stings.

01:21:29.845 --> 01:21:33.359
- How's your neck?
- It's kind of hard to swallow.

01:21:34.358 --> 01:21:36.246
You didn't have to choke me,
you know.

01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:39.540
Why did you tell Veronica I was
gonna dump her to go with Caitlin?

01:21:39.607 --> 01:21:42.455
- I thought I was doing you a favor.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:21:42.519 --> 01:21:44.975
You're always saying
how you can't initiate change.

01:21:45.048 --> 01:21:48.496
- I thought I'd give you a hand.
- Thanks.

01:21:48.568 --> 01:21:50.423
You still didn't have to choke me.

01:21:50.488 --> 01:21:53.304
Oh, please.
I'm surprised I didn't kill you.

01:21:53.369 --> 01:21:55.158
- Why do you say that?
- Why do I say that?

01:21:55.226 --> 01:21:56.917
Forget it.

01:21:56.986 --> 01:21:58.961
No, really.
What did I do that was so wrong?

01:21:59.034 --> 01:22:00.376
What don't you do?

01:22:00.443 --> 01:22:03.510
Sometimes I think you come to work
to make my life miserable.

01:22:03.579 --> 01:22:05.848
- How do you figure?
- What time did you get to work?

01:22:05.915 --> 01:22:08.218
Like 10:00, or ten after.

01:22:08.284 --> 01:22:11.219
You were half an hour late.
And then all you do is come in here.

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:14.938
- Yeah, to talk to you.
- Which means the video store is closed.

01:22:15.005 --> 01:22:18.551
- It's not like I'm miles away.
- Unless you're out renting videos.

01:22:18.622 --> 01:22:21.372
Hermaphrodites. I rented it
so we could watch it together.

01:22:21.438 --> 01:22:22.846
You get me slapped with a fine.

01:22:22.911 --> 01:22:25.846
You argue with the customers,
and I have to patch everything up.

01:22:25.919 --> 01:22:28.603
You get us thrown out of a funeral
by violating the corpse.

01:22:28.672 --> 01:22:31.869
To top it off, you ruin my relationship.
What's your encore?

01:22:31.936 --> 01:22:35.482
Do you, like, anally rape my mother
while pouring sugar in my gas tank?

01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:41.054
You know what the real tragedy
about all of this is?

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:43.163
I'm not even supposed
to be here today!

01:22:43.235 --> 01:22:46.497
Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you, pal!

01:22:46.563 --> 01:22:48.603
Jesus, there you go,
trying to pass the buck.

01:22:48.675 --> 01:22:50.530
I'm the source of all your misery.

01:22:50.596 --> 01:22:54.077
Who closed the store to play hockey?
Who closed the store to go to a wake?

01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:56.418
Who tried to win back
his ex-girlfriend

01:22:56.485 --> 01:22:59.355
without even discussing
how he felt with his present one?

01:22:59.429 --> 01:23:01.502
You wanna blame somebody?
Blame yourself.

01:23:01.574 --> 01:23:03.549
"I'm not even supposed
to be here today".

01:23:03.622 --> 01:23:05.313
You sound like an asshole!

01:23:05.382 --> 01:23:07.324
Jesus, nobody twisted
your arm to be here.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:09.374
You're here of your own volition.

01:23:09.447 --> 01:23:12.262
You like to think the weight
of the world rests on your shoulder,

01:23:12.328 --> 01:23:14.597
like this would fall apart
if Dante wasn't here.

01:23:14.664 --> 01:23:18.210
Jesus, you overcompensate for having
what's basically a monkey's job.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:22.722
You push fuckin' buttons. Anybody
could waltz in here and do our jobs.

01:23:22.794 --> 01:23:25.925
You're so obsessed
with making it seem so much more epic,

01:23:25.994 --> 01:23:28.297
so much more important
than it really is.

01:23:28.363 --> 01:23:32.771
Christ, you work in a convenience store,
Dante, and badly, I might add.

01:23:32.843 --> 01:23:35.975
I work in a shitty video store,
badly as well.

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:39.820
That guy Jay's got it right.
He has no delusions about what he does.

01:23:39.885 --> 01:23:42.569
We like to make ourselves
seem more important

01:23:42.637 --> 01:23:45.605
than the people that come in
to buy a paper or cigarettes.

01:23:45.677 --> 01:23:48.133
We look down on them
as if we're so advanced.

01:23:48.206 --> 01:23:51.851
Well, if we're so fuckin' advanced,
what are we doin' workin' here?

01:24:09.650 --> 01:24:12.967
Hey, the floor looks pretty clean.
I put the cat next door.

01:24:13.043 --> 01:24:16.339
- Need a ride home?
- No, I got one. Just pulled up.

01:24:16.915 --> 01:24:20.178
- You workin' tomorrow?
- Same time. What about you?

01:24:20.244 --> 01:24:23.540
I'm callin' out.
Goin' to the hospital and visit Caitlin.

01:24:23.605 --> 01:24:25.940
And then I'm gonna
try to talk to Veronica.

01:24:26.005 --> 01:24:29.999
You wanna grab a bite to eat when you're
done with that and I get off work?

01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:32.885
- I'll give you a call, let you know.
- All right.

01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:34.838
Hey, good luck with Veronica.

01:24:34.902 --> 01:24:36.943
I can talk to her,
try to straighten...

01:24:37.015 --> 01:24:39.568
No, thanks.
I think I can handle it.

01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:42.258
We have a lot of shit to talk about.

01:24:42.328 --> 01:24:45.198
- Hell of a day.
- To say the least.

01:24:45.272 --> 01:24:48.088
Want me to do anything
before I get out of here, man?

01:24:48.153 --> 01:24:49.714
Why don't you wrangle for me?

01:24:49.786 --> 01:24:52.339
- [Scoffs] No.
- Come on. Just wrangle out the door.

01:24:52.410 --> 01:24:54.996
- No. No, no, no.
- Come on.

01:24:55.066 --> 01:24:56.921
# Here comes Randal

01:24:56.986 --> 01:24:59.256

01:25:06.396 --> 01:25:08.251
