DOC:
I know you're still
settling in here and all,

00:03.036 --> 00:05.335
but I figure if you're gonna
be my new bodyguard,

00:05.405 --> 00:06.600
you might as well see
what you're in for.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.471
Yes sir...

00:08.541 --> 00:11.375
when you're riding shotgun
with a Rusty Venture,

00:11.444 --> 00:13.470
the road can get
a little bit bumpy.

00:13.546 --> 00:17.642
Pays to keep
a few spares in the trunk.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.982
Oh, don't be so squeamish.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.316
Kinda takes a little
of the pressure

00:21.388 --> 00:22.549
off your job, doesn't it?

00:22.622 --> 00:23.646
[ chuckles ]

00:23.723 --> 00:25.248
Don't talk much, do you?

00:25.325 --> 00:26.156
Well, good.

00:26.226 --> 00:29.094
Because mum's the word about
my little cabbage patch here.

00:29.162 --> 00:32.131
These tadpoles aren't
exactly street legal,

00:32.198 --> 00:35.225
if you get my drift.

00:35.301 --> 00:37.236
You know, you really shouldn't
smoke when we're pregnant.

00:37.303 --> 00:38.999
[laughs ]

00:39.072 --> 00:42.304
Seriously...no smoking
in the lab areas.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.073
Oooooh!

00:45.145 --> 00:46.340
Oh, what is this?!

00:46.413 --> 00:48.882
No no no,
this won't do at all.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.678
Specimen D-19.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.742
Yeah, 'had a feeling
about this one.

00:52.819 --> 00:54.788
Autosomes always did look
a bit sloppy,

00:54.854 --> 00:56.049
just between you and me.

00:56.122 --> 00:57.454
God!

00:57.524 --> 01:00.084
Is that a face only a mother
could love or what?

01:00.160 --> 01:02.425
Good thing she's not
here then, huh?

01:02.495 --> 01:05.590
So...what are we gonna do
for lunch?

01:09.936 --> 01:12.303
HATRED:
Dean? Dean?!

01:12.372 --> 01:13.738
What'd ya fall in?!

01:13.807 --> 01:17.403
Come on now, Lil Mister,
the head is for everyone!

01:17.477 --> 01:20.311
You've had your ten, now give
your brother his shift!

01:20.380 --> 01:22.645
[whimpering ]

01:27.987 --> 01:28.920
Wha--?
Oh, come on!

01:28.988 --> 01:30.650
Hey! Hey!
I'm in here!

01:30.723 --> 01:32.191
Well, you should be
in your room, mister!

01:32.258 --> 01:33.351
You are grounded!

01:33.426 --> 01:34.758
I'm not even allowed
to make a pee now?

01:34.828 --> 01:36.353
Not in here you aren't!

01:36.429 --> 01:38.022
It's our only bathroom!

01:38.098 --> 01:38.929
You should have
thought of that

01:38.998 --> 01:40.193
before you called your father

01:40.266 --> 01:42.132
"the President of the United
States of Boogers"

01:42.202 --> 01:43.261
in front of company.

01:43.336 --> 01:45.168
Now get out!

01:45.238 --> 01:47.207
You get out!
I'm peeing!

01:47.273 --> 01:48.400
Oh, no you aren't-- Hank!

01:48.475 --> 01:52.742
[ chanting ]
Attica! Attica! Attica!

01:54.047 --> 01:57.142
[ raspy breathing ]

02:02.322 --> 02:05.156
[ yawns ]

02:10.295 --> 02:11.992
Daddy?
You're the--

02:12.065 --> 02:14.000
Dean.
We need to talk.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.002
There is no hair fairy,
is there?

02:16.069 --> 02:17.128
Not even close.

02:17.203 --> 02:18.501
The time has come
for you to leave

02:18.571 --> 02:20.665
the magic and folly
of childhood behind, Dean.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.504
Because I'm
losing all my baby hair,

02:22.575 --> 02:24.339
and my grown-up hair's gonna
start coming in soon?

02:24.410 --> 02:25.878
No, because you need
to start taking

02:25.945 --> 02:28.710
your future career in science
more seriously, Dean.

02:28.781 --> 02:31.012
Your biological time bomb
is ticking!

02:31.084 --> 02:32.484
But I have been practicing
my science

02:32.552 --> 02:33.884
just like you told me, Pop.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.285
Look, I made these.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.950
Shrinky dinks
don't count, son.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.084
I'm not even going to ask you
why you sleep with those things.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.719
'Cause I can't
find Mr. Reachy.

02:41.794 --> 02:42.727
Don't blame yourself, Dean.

02:42.795 --> 02:43.660
It's my fault.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.790
I should have
given you this years ago.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.800
Ta-daaaaa!

02:47.867 --> 02:49.358
The... panic room?

02:49.435 --> 02:51.233
Your very own junior
laboratory!

02:51.304 --> 02:53.466
No more working on
the kitchen table for you!

02:53.540 --> 02:56.305
In here, you'll be able
to really focus on your science

02:56.376 --> 02:58.470
with no distractions!

02:58.545 --> 03:00.480
How come Baby Einstein
gets his own lab

03:00.547 --> 03:02.675
and I'm stuck pushing boxes
around, huh?

03:02.749 --> 03:04.877
When do I get to train
for my future career?

03:04.951 --> 03:06.852
Who says you're not
right now?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.582
Those go up
in the attic, boy.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.715
Well, I'm sure your brain's
already buzzing

03:10.790 --> 03:13.385
with a million ideas you want
to get cracking on.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.155
Can I get you anything else?

03:15.228 --> 03:16.059
A window?

03:16.129 --> 03:17.461
Like I said --
no distractions!

03:17.530 --> 03:18.828
Now go get
into your speed suit.

03:18.898 --> 03:20.958
I have another
surprise for you.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.129
"Get into your speed suit.
I have a surprise for you."

03:24.204 --> 03:25.433
Good gravy!

03:25.505 --> 03:27.167
Never gave me my own lab.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.538
Never gave me nothin'!

03:28.608 --> 03:30.406
Why do you they get
to have everything?

03:30.476 --> 03:31.808
I'm as smart as they are!

03:31.878 --> 03:33.312
I'm smarter, even!

03:33.379 --> 03:35.280
They keep going to sleep
with the angels,

03:35.348 --> 03:37.510
but I'm still here!

03:37.584 --> 03:40.144
DOC'S VOICE:
Aren't you a little old
for stuffed animals?

03:40.220 --> 03:43.088
Don't you think you should give
that back to the real Dean?

03:43.156 --> 03:44.522
I am a real Dean!

03:44.591 --> 03:46.082
No, you were rejected.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.593
You weren't good enough.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.094
You mean I wasn't
pretty enough...

03:51.431 --> 03:52.956
My god,
but you are hideous.

03:53.032 --> 03:55.058
I can't believe
you even came from me.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.228
I try to be like the ones
you love so much.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.669
I watch them.

03:58.738 --> 03:59.899
I learn from them...

03:59.973 --> 04:01.839
Yeah, but then there's
still the whole...

04:01.908 --> 04:03.069
face issue.

04:03.142 --> 04:05.008
Not after tonight!

04:05.078 --> 04:07.240
Just you wait and see!

04:07.313 --> 04:08.576
It's almost finished!

04:08.648 --> 04:11.516
I just need one more and then...

04:11.584 --> 04:13.519
and then I'm gonna be
just like the rest of them...

04:13.586 --> 04:16.146
Oh, yessirree bob!

04:16.221 --> 04:18.589
[grunts ]

04:18.658 --> 04:19.887
Hard to...

04:19.959 --> 04:21.517
[grunts ]
leather...

04:21.594 --> 04:23.222
Great.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.697
On top of everything else,
you're getting fat now, too.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.427
[ clang! ]
Was that you?

04:27.500 --> 04:28.695
I'm not even here, crazy.

04:31.571 --> 04:32.402
[ muttering ]

04:34.841 --> 04:37.310
It's all about Dean,
isn't it?

04:39.979 --> 04:42.471
Tonight! Tonight!

04:44.951 --> 04:46.579
Whoa-hoooo Nelly!

04:46.653 --> 04:48.485
And that's just
at "N scale!"

04:48.554 --> 04:53.219
It's a fresh new twist
on the classic decoy tactic.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.956
We place 'em in key locations
around the compound,

04:56.029 --> 04:57.622
and the next time
your Monarch

04:57.697 --> 05:00.189
or your Baron Whats-His-Bheit
comes a-knockin',

05:00.266 --> 05:02.326
he gets spanked in the face

05:02.402 --> 05:05.804
with 5'7"
of screamin' hot stop it!

05:05.872 --> 05:07.306
I'm five ten.

05:07.373 --> 05:10.468
Yeah, maybe with them fancy
elevator beatle boots of yours.

05:10.543 --> 05:13.570
Got a delivery here
for a "Sgt. Hatred"?

05:13.646 --> 05:14.807
Are either of you...?

05:14.881 --> 05:16.179
Oh, take a guess.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.478
Sign here, please.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.018
Whoa! Easy!

05:19.085 --> 05:21.680
Let's just be real careful
with those.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.655
Kid gloves.

05:23.723 --> 05:26.022
Sir, do these crates contain
any hazardous materials

05:26.092 --> 05:27.788
I should know about?

05:27.860 --> 05:29.829
I'm required by law to-

05:29.896 --> 05:31.592
Hey, Nosey McPeeks-A-Lot.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.462
You know what brown
can do for me?

05:33.533 --> 05:36.298
He can mind his own business.

05:36.369 --> 05:37.632
Oh, sorry.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.673
Well, hey there,
slugger!

05:39.739 --> 05:42.641
You look like you're buckin'
for my job!

05:42.709 --> 05:44.610
Did my dad tell you
to say that?

05:44.677 --> 05:45.770
Uh, no...

05:45.845 --> 05:47.837
Then...
are you psychic?

05:47.914 --> 05:49.382
Hank, leave the man alone.

05:49.449 --> 05:52.442
Just because he's black doesn't
mean he has "the shining."

05:52.518 --> 05:53.645
[sighs ]

05:53.720 --> 05:56.189
Save me, dude.

05:56.255 --> 05:57.518
Done.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.058
Now am I ungrounded?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.855
Why, have you finished
washing the car already?

06:00.927 --> 06:01.758
- What?
- It was on the list.

06:01.828 --> 06:02.989
What "list?"

06:03.062 --> 06:04.587
The "things Hank has to do
for his father

06:04.664 --> 06:06.530
before I can even think
of un-grounding him" list.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.192
Oh, didn't I c.c.
You on that?

06:08.267 --> 06:09.257
Aww!
What--?!

06:09.335 --> 06:11.167
Aw, there's like 20 --

06:11.237 --> 06:12.102
[groans ]

06:12.171 --> 06:14.538
Hold up a sec, Hank.

06:14.607 --> 06:15.870
Number four.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.843
Like mirrors, Hank.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.573
I don't wanna tell ya how to do
your daddy duty or nothing,

06:20.646 --> 06:22.308
but don'tcha think
maybe you're bein'

06:22.382 --> 06:25.318
just a little too hard
on the ol' Hankinator?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.648
"Hankinator?"

06:26.719 --> 06:28.688
You're sleeping
with him, aren't you?!

06:35.995 --> 06:36.826
DERMOTT:
Hey.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.592
Hey.
How'd you get in?

06:38.664 --> 06:40.565
Security's a joke
in this dump.

06:40.633 --> 06:41.726
So, what're you in for?

06:41.801 --> 06:43.394
12 counts of
"sass in the first degree."

06:43.469 --> 06:44.903
Gay.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.337
And I peed in the tub?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.136
- S'pretty badass.
- Right?

06:48.207 --> 06:49.903
Yeah, I'm grounded, too.
I snuck out, though.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.069
Ninjutsu.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.339
Hey, where's
your dorky brother?

06:52.412 --> 06:55.348
Probably busy getting his heiney
shined by my dad.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.883
He gets to do
whatever he wants

06:56.949 --> 07:00.078
and I'm stuck with a list
of dumb chores.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.145
Pfft.
He's lucky he's not here.

07:02.221 --> 07:03.519
Still owe him a beatdown.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.251
Didn't he kinda...
beat you up?

07:05.324 --> 07:06.849
What is that supposed
to be, a joke?

07:06.926 --> 07:08.724
He cheap shotted me
when I wasn't ready.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.526
Plus I had, like, a massive
stomach flu that day.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.395
Sor-ry.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.765
Check it -- number five,
you do that one yet?

07:15.835 --> 07:17.201
- No.
- Sweet.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.829
If your dad needs
his car washed,

07:18.905 --> 07:20.874
let's give him
a good reason to wash it.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.203
The egg.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.608
It is the symbol of creation.

07:24.677 --> 07:25.872
And since I was your age,

07:25.945 --> 07:28.540
it has hatched all my greatest
super-science ideas...

07:28.614 --> 07:30.378
- No windows...
- Pay attention, Dean.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.543
Now sit down.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.313
You're about to meet my muse.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.786
Mommy?

07:34.854 --> 07:37.414
Progressive rock!

07:37.490 --> 07:39.152
Now normally,
I'd start you off with Asia

07:39.225 --> 07:40.420
or something more accessible.

07:40.493 --> 07:43.759
But I think you're ready
for the primo shit.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.458
Just take a gander
at that cover art

07:45.531 --> 07:48.160
and try to pretend you're not
already inspired.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.635
It's like something out
of a dream.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.604
Painted by our greatest
living artist...

07:52.672 --> 07:54.868
Mr. Roger Dean.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.239
Hey, that's my name!

07:56.309 --> 07:57.470
That's no accident, boy.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.603
Maybe now you have some
sense of the gravity--

07:59.679 --> 08:01.375
nay, the destiny--
of this moment.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.348
This is your birthright.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.817
Golly, I don't know
what to say...

08:05.885 --> 08:08.684
Just say...yes!

08:08.754 --> 08:10.985
Hey, what's this one
with the face?

08:11.057 --> 08:12.286
That?

08:12.358 --> 08:13.519
Oh no no no no...

08:13.593 --> 08:15.892
you are not ready to step into
the court of the crimson king.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.828
At this stage
in your training,

08:17.897 --> 08:20.332
album like that could turn you
into an evil scientist.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.890
Buckle your mind, Dean.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.402
Because it's about

We've got a fire
inside the compound.

18:40.319 --> 18:41.947
They're goin'
full Waco on us.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.318
This is it people!

18:43.388 --> 18:44.856
We gotta save
those kids in there!

18:44.923 --> 18:48.155
Move in! Move in!

18:48.227 --> 18:49.627
Freeze!

18:49.695 --> 18:52.255
Down on the ground, baldy!

18:54.867 --> 18:57.530
HATRED:
Doc! Doc!

18:57.603 --> 18:59.936
Code orange!
Fire in the compound!

19:00.005 --> 19:01.098
Yeah, no duh.

19:01.173 --> 19:04.200
You gotta get to--
oh, hey! It's the police!

19:04.276 --> 19:06.268
Man, you guys
got here qui-

19:06.345 --> 19:08.644
This is your last warning,
Churchy.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.878
If you do not drop down
and spread 'em in 3...2...

19:11.950 --> 19:13.213
[engine starts ]

19:13.285 --> 19:15.277
Hey, c'mon now, fellas!

19:15.354 --> 19:17.186
Don't you know who I work for?

19:17.256 --> 19:19.122
Yeah. Me.
They're not impressed.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.750
That my hard drive?

19:20.826 --> 19:23.057
Hey, listen, uh, any
questionable images

19:23.128 --> 19:24.824
you may or may not
find on there

19:24.897 --> 19:25.728
are 100%
computer-generated.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.462
MAN ON RADIO:
Uh, Sheriff?

19:29.535 --> 19:31.060
You'd better get out here...

19:31.136 --> 19:32.832
Freedom!!!

19:32.905 --> 19:34.066
Ahhgh!

19:34.139 --> 19:36.631
Not again!!!

19:36.708 --> 19:37.698
You think they saw us?

19:37.776 --> 19:40.473
Look, dude!
Look out!

19:51.723 --> 19:53.658
Hey, that's where that is.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.626
Dean!

19:56.695 --> 19:58.994
All I wanted was
to grow my hair back!

19:59.064 --> 20:00.327
W-What do you want
from me?!

20:00.399 --> 20:02.095
I want your pretty
little life!

20:02.167 --> 20:04.432
And your smooth,
pretty little face!

20:04.503 --> 20:06.870
I don't even want
to be a scientist!

20:06.939 --> 20:10.671
I'm only doing this because
my dad made me do it!

20:10.742 --> 20:13.041
Me too!

20:16.248 --> 20:18.183
What in the hell is that?

20:18.250 --> 20:20.378
Probably the comet
these poor fools think

20:20.452 --> 20:24.617
they're gonna fly away
to heaven on.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.022
DERMOTT:
Dude! Hold up!

20:26.091 --> 20:27.684
Stop here!
- Did we miss a turn?

20:27.759 --> 20:29.387
This is my house.
I gotta go.

20:29.461 --> 20:30.759
Dermott, sweety?
Is that you?

20:30.829 --> 20:31.660
Coming...

20:31.730 --> 20:34.359
W-What about Mexico?
- I got curfew.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.061
Besides, someone has
to stay here

20:36.134 --> 20:37.500
and disseminate
the cover story.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.299
- Dermott...
- I'm coming! Jeez!

20:39.371 --> 20:41.033
Take a chill pill,
why don't ya?

20:41.106 --> 20:42.597
Vaya con Dios, dude.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.472
Take this.
You're gonna need it.

20:44.543 --> 20:47.012
Get me, like, fireworks
and Spanish fly.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.914
[sirens approach ]

20:55.721 --> 20:57.656
Son?

20:57.723 --> 20:59.715
That's enough.

20:59.791 --> 21:00.884
D-Daddy?

21:00.959 --> 21:02.518
You don't need to hurt
that other poor Dean

21:02.594 --> 21:03.653
to get what you want.

21:03.729 --> 21:04.992
I don't?

21:05.063 --> 21:05.894
No, son.

21:05.964 --> 21:09.560
Because all you ever really
wanted was a father's love.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.332
And you don't need to look
like him to get it.

21:12.404 --> 21:13.565
- I don't?
- Of course not.

21:13.639 --> 21:15.403
Aside from some
basic hygiene issues,

21:15.474 --> 21:17.807
you're perfect just
the way you are.

21:17.876 --> 21:18.844
Now come here.

21:18.910 --> 21:22.904
Give your old man a hug.

21:22.981 --> 21:23.971
That's it.

21:24.049 --> 21:26.018
Let it all out.

21:26.084 --> 21:27.814
Don't be shy, now.
Hug away!

21:27.886 --> 21:28.717
Daddy!

21:30.922 --> 21:32.220
Who the hell was that?

22:05.791 --> 22:07.384
[sighs ]

22:07.459 --> 22:08.290
Mexico.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.023
Hank! What the hell
do you think you're doing?!

22:11.096 --> 22:13.224
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?

22:13.298 --> 22:15.130
You set fire
to your brother's lab,

22:15.200 --> 22:16.862
you try to run away
in my people mover,

22:16.935 --> 22:18.369
you call the police on me?

22:18.437 --> 22:20.531
And you think that entitles you
to listen to records?

22:20.605 --> 22:22.437
What world are you
living in,

22:22.507 --> 22:23.770
where you think there's
even a chance

22:23.842 --> 22:26.437
that you won't be grounded
for the rest of the year?

22:26.511 --> 22:29.379
And you don't take a man's
Jimmy Buffet records

22:29.448 --> 22:31.144
without askin' either!
