00:07.640 --> 00:11.172
Sam, when you were in the back,
one of your women called.

00:11.307 --> 00:14.306
She said to tell you
that you're a lying piece of garbage

00:14.433 --> 00:16.673
and she never wants to see you again.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.800
Did she leave her name?

00:20.018 --> 00:23.218
No, but she did tell me
to add one more thing.

00:23.352 --> 00:24.726
What's that?

00:28.561 --> 00:31.050
Yeah, that's Patty.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.082 --> 02:03.405
Your move, Sammy.

02:03.540 --> 02:07.749
Sam, I'll only ask this once.
If you say no, it's no.

02:07.875 --> 02:12.083
But I would love to start doing
caricatures of the customers here.

02:12.209 --> 02:17.282
Caricature is a satirical form of art
that the common man loves.

02:17.418 --> 02:21.164
It would be a wonderful memento
of our customers' visits here.

02:21.294 --> 02:22.159
No.

02:22.295 --> 02:25.791
My art instructor
said I'm an original

02:25.920 --> 02:28.623
and this would be
an invaluable experience.

02:28.754 --> 02:29.702
No.

02:29.838 --> 02:31.876
I'd only do it
during the slow periods

02:32.005 --> 02:34.459
It wouldn't interfere
with waiting tables.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.374
- No.
- What do you say? Can I do it?

02:37.506 --> 02:40.754
- No.
- We'll talk about it later.

02:41.382 --> 02:45.246
No, we won't talk about this later.
I don't want you to do that.

02:45.383 --> 02:47.125
I'm going to do it anyway.

02:50.342 --> 02:53.010
Well, at least she cleared it
with me first.

02:55.135 --> 02:57.126
Here you go, Carla.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.544
- Gin Collins, vodka Collins.
- Thanks. Which one's which?

03:00.678 --> 03:04.803
The gin Collins is in Larry,
the vodka Collins is in Steve.

03:06.096 --> 03:10.422
- Coach, what are you talking about?
- Larry and Steve.

03:12.472 --> 03:17.344
- You've named the glasses?
- How else do I know which is which?

03:18.015 --> 03:23.965
I mean, over here is Pete,
Glen, Fred, Al...

03:24.100 --> 03:28.225
Not to offend the ladies, we've got
Jeannie, Ginger, Gracie, Sally...

03:28.351 --> 03:33.139
- How do you tell which one is which?
- To me, they're different.

03:33.268 --> 03:35.888
Except the Wilson brothers.

03:37.811 --> 03:39.139
Afternoon, everybody.

03:39.270 --> 03:41.391
- Norm!
- Norman.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.476
Gentlemen, start your taps.

03:44.688 --> 03:46.975
- How's it going?
- Not so good.

03:47.105 --> 03:49.511
I missed a digit
in the debit column today.

03:49.647 --> 03:52.183
The boss is now using my butt
for an ashtray.

03:53.231 --> 03:56.432
Norm, would you please
watch your language today?

03:56.565 --> 03:59.101
- Sure. What's the problem?
- Lisa's coming over.

03:59.441 --> 04:01.764
I didn't know that.
It'll be great to see her.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.179
Who is Lisa?

04:03.317 --> 04:06.897
That's the Coach's daughter.
Or is it a martini glass?

04:08.360 --> 04:11.027
- How's she doing?
- She's absolutely wonderful.

04:11.152 --> 04:13.190
She's introducing me to her fiancé.

04:15.236 --> 04:16.101
Great.

04:16.236 --> 04:21.108
You never told me she was engaged.
She said she was married to her work.

04:21.237 --> 04:26.192
Well, like most women, she wants
both. This is the 19... what, '80s?

04:26.905 --> 04:28.482
Come here.

04:28.614 --> 04:33.853
- Listen, are you alright?
- You see, I never met the fella.

04:33.990 --> 04:36.526
I'm just hoping
that I can hit it off with him.

04:36.657 --> 04:40.818
- It's really been bugging me.
- Relax. You're gonna do just fine.

04:41.367 --> 04:43.820
Yeah, I guess I do worry too much.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.819
Since Lisa's mother died,
she's been my whole life.

04:46.951 --> 04:50.649
Coach, you did a great job
with Lisa. Don't worry.

04:50.785 --> 04:52.243
Thanks, Sam.

04:54.536 --> 04:55.911
Great guy, that Sam.

04:56.037 --> 04:58.526
Why don't you name a glass after him?

05:02.788 --> 05:07.530
Excuse me, my name is Diane.
I'm the Cheers caricaturist.

05:07.664 --> 05:12.821
I couldn't help but notice that you
are very much in love with this lady.

05:12.957 --> 05:14.865
And I have a sketch for you.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.873
Which one of us is that?

05:28.794 --> 05:31.283
That's a pretty good caricature.

05:31.419 --> 05:34.288
Don't toy with my emotions.

05:34.420 --> 05:37.419
I'm serious.
It looks just like her, I think.

05:41.338 --> 05:43.827
Of course. Yes, excuse me.

05:46.423 --> 05:47.584
Hello.

05:47.715 --> 05:52.420
I'm Diane, the Cheers caricaturist.
I have a drawing of you.

05:53.841 --> 05:56.544
- Let me see.
- Just a minute. Do you have a hobby?

05:56.675 --> 06:01.001
- Horseback riding.
- Yes, that is fun, isn't it?

06:10.261 --> 06:12.466
Now you may look.

06:12.595 --> 06:14.503
This is me?

06:14.637 --> 06:16.712
Why am I sitting on a lizard?

06:29.224 --> 06:31.973
- Daddy!
- Lisa!

06:32.099 --> 06:36.390
Honey, it's so good to see you.
Everybody, here's my daughter Lisa.

06:39.226 --> 06:40.802
- Hi, Sam.
- How are you doing?

06:40.935 --> 06:42.511
- Really good.
- You look good.

06:42.643 --> 06:44.930
- Thanks.
- This is Diane.

06:45.352 --> 06:47.758
- Very nice to meet you.
- You also.

06:48.686 --> 06:51.471
Where's your fiancé?

06:51.604 --> 06:53.844
Roy'll be right in.
He's parking the car.

06:54.479 --> 06:57.893
So, where did you meet the guy?

06:58.022 --> 07:01.968
We both work for the same company.
He's our top salesman.

07:02.106 --> 07:04.097
Good for you. That's great.

07:07.190 --> 07:09.975
Everybody!
This is my daughter's fiancé.

07:12.150 --> 07:13.975
Let's hear it.

07:14.109 --> 07:18.518
Darling. Roy,
this is Carla and Diane and Sam.

07:18.651 --> 07:20.144
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:20.277 --> 07:22.564
And this is my father Ernie.

07:22.694 --> 07:25.183
- A pleasure to meet you.
- The feeling's ditto.

07:25.569 --> 07:28.852
- Can I get you a nice cold beer?
- Sure, Pops.

07:28.987 --> 07:30.943
Mind if I smoke?

07:31.071 --> 07:33.904
Listen, cigar smoke bothers me.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.857
I know. It stinks,
but it tastes great.

07:38.156 --> 07:41.901
So, Lisa tells me
you and Sam were in baseball.

07:42.031 --> 07:45.729
- That's right.
- I think it's a dead sport.

07:45.866 --> 07:50.074
They just haven't claimed the body
yet. People need action these days.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.776
What sport do you like?

07:52.909 --> 07:55.315
Female full-contact karate.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.944
Excuse me,
I have to go jump-start my brain.

08:05.412 --> 08:08.244
Look out for that one.
She could steal my heart.

08:09.412 --> 08:13.738
Cliff, I smell Chinese food.
It's a cigar.

08:19.665 --> 08:24.537
So, you're a salesman
with my daughter's firm?

08:24.666 --> 08:28.612
Yeah. Talk about coincidence.
Lisa's my district manager.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.120
Has my fate in her hands.

08:31.251 --> 08:35.789
I'm working Jersey now, but I'm
moving up to Pennsylvania soon.

08:35.918 --> 08:38.371
I suppose
something could be arranged.

08:39.044 --> 08:41.958
- What do you sell?
- Suits door-to-door.

08:45.879 --> 08:48.035
Is this one of the suits here?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.834
- You took the bait, Sam.
- I did?

08:51.672 --> 08:53.462
Hold this.

08:55.089 --> 08:58.586
I'm wearing an Omni suit right now,
and, man, am I comfortable.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.914
The best part is its versatility.

09:03.049 --> 09:07.044
This suit comes with two coats,
three pairs of pants and five vests.

09:07.175 --> 09:11.466
The ensemble makes 120 combinations.
Everything from dignified to sporty.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.998
If you owned one,
you could go from a funeral

09:14.135 --> 09:16.802
to a night on the town
without even going home.

09:16.927 --> 09:20.874
Well, I was trapped
in just that situation Tuesday night.

09:21.011 --> 09:24.342
We're gonna be late
for our dinner reservation.

09:24.471 --> 09:27.588
Sam, you and I happen.

09:28.930 --> 09:31.763
Catch you later.
Let's go put on the feedbags.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.341
We'll be back in a little while.
Daddy, come with us.

09:35.473 --> 09:39.254
No, you go ahead, I got something
to do. I'll see you later.

09:39.391 --> 09:42.638
- Alright, I'll see you later.
- Alright.

09:44.725 --> 09:49.430
You know, I am so glad that
you two finally got a chance to meet.

09:49.559 --> 09:54.099
<i>Ciao. Do you get it?
We're going to eat and I said ciao.</i>

09:54.227 --> 09:56.135
<i>Ciao. I'm a funny guy.</i>

10:01.770 --> 10:04.603
Could you cover for me
for a couple of moments?

10:04.729 --> 10:07.894
- Sure. Where are you going?
- To toss my lunch.

10:19.858 --> 10:22.098
Chuck,
how's the job search going?

10:22.233 --> 10:24.355
I got something.
I'm not crazy about it.

10:24.484 --> 10:26.309
I'm a janitor at a biology lab

10:26.443 --> 10:30.437
where they do DNA experiments
making mutant viruses.

10:31.402 --> 10:33.808
- Sounds like a good job to me.
- I don't know.

10:33.944 --> 10:37.524
Makes me a little nervous,
all that weird stuff floating around.

10:37.653 --> 10:40.735
- Don't worry about it.
- Don't sweat it.

10:40.862 --> 10:43.268
They handle all that stuff.

10:43.405 --> 10:45.976
You're right.
Must be getting paranoid.

10:47.322 --> 10:49.148
See you later.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.979
I feel better already. Bye-bye.

10:52.115 --> 10:54.604
- Bye.
- Take care, Chuck.

11:01.242 --> 11:02.865
He used the phone.

11:26.122 --> 11:27.746
The man's a pig.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.946
I just had dinner with a pig.

11:32.957 --> 11:36.703
He's even more disgusting
when he's around food.

11:36.833 --> 11:39.369
- That's hard to believe.
- Hard to believe?

11:39.500 --> 11:43.412
The last thing I saw, he was pulling
his chair up to a dessert cart.

11:44.376 --> 11:48.667
- What will you do about this?
- I gave Lisa everything she wanted.

11:48.794 --> 11:52.658
- What can I do?
- You have to tell her how you feel.

11:52.795 --> 11:57.204
- I can no longer hold my tongue.
- Want me to do it?

12:00.630 --> 12:02.206
Coach, come here.

12:03.881 --> 12:08.788
I'm a daughter myself. Let me
tell you something about my father.

12:08.923 --> 12:12.539
My father
is a very wise and learned man,

12:12.674 --> 12:14.795
but he never gave himself a chance

12:14.925 --> 12:17.295
to get to know the boys
I brought home.

12:17.425 --> 12:20.589
He would decide he didn't like them
for no better reason

12:20.718 --> 12:24.926
than one had bad posture
or another one had facial hair.

12:25.552 --> 12:28.302
I'll never forget
when I was foolish enough

12:28.428 --> 12:30.917
to bring home a utopian socialist.

12:31.053 --> 12:33.625
- Oh, my God!
- No!

12:35.679 --> 12:39.092
I know, it's unbelievable.
I was a rebel then.

12:41.681 --> 12:46.754
The point is, you mustn't make
the mistake of judging too quickly.

12:47.765 --> 12:51.807
- Now, call me crazy...
- You are crazy.

12:52.766 --> 12:57.674
Very funny. What I am struggling to
say is, call me a bleeding heart...

12:57.809 --> 13:00.133
You're a bleeding heart.

13:00.268 --> 13:01.809
Call me cute as a button.

13:03.935 --> 13:05.345
Fine.

13:06.894 --> 13:09.099
Coach, I'm a humanist.

13:09.228 --> 13:11.101
That means that I have to believe

13:11.229 --> 13:14.595
there's something fine and noble
about every human being.

13:14.729 --> 13:18.261
If we haven't found
what's fine and noble about Roy yet,

13:18.397 --> 13:21.146
it means that we haven't looked
deeply enough.

13:23.190 --> 13:26.603
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

13:27.399 --> 13:29.141
Your mother!

13:29.983 --> 13:33.184
Like no one ever knocked over
a dessert cart before.

13:34.859 --> 13:36.021
How about a beer?

13:42.152 --> 13:44.819
Look, you've gotta talk to her.

13:44.944 --> 13:47.516
Coach, you have to give Roy
a chance.

13:47.653 --> 13:50.142
- You don't.
- That's not a bad restaurant.

13:50.279 --> 13:53.811
The dessert guy's a dink
but the cuisine was tasty.

13:53.946 --> 13:55.854
But what am I telling you, chubs?

14:01.823 --> 14:04.691
- Where's Lisa?
- She's upstairs settling the bill.

14:14.743 --> 14:18.488
Are you saying
you had her pay for dinner?

14:18.618 --> 14:21.819
They wouldn't take
a post-dated four-party cheque.

14:23.036 --> 14:26.402
If they're going to be hard-nosed,
they should put up a sign.

14:35.456 --> 14:38.454
Do you still say
there's something good in that?

14:39.998 --> 14:41.456
There must be.

14:41.999 --> 14:45.993
Roy, how about if
you and I chat over here?

14:46.125 --> 14:47.499
Good idea.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.830
Will you excuse us for a moment?

14:51.001 --> 14:53.454
The suit's getting to you, isn't it?

14:58.544 --> 15:03.167
Roy, your personality is very...

15:05.045 --> 15:06.918
- ... strong.
- Amen.

15:09.130 --> 15:12.212
But I know that's not the real you.

15:12.630 --> 15:17.004
You know, an aggressive personality
is often a mask

15:17.131 --> 15:20.083
for a very shy and sensitive soul.

15:20.215 --> 15:22.965
I'm willing to gamble
that you are such a person.

15:24.008 --> 15:26.544
You're not wearing a bra, are you?

15:32.676 --> 15:34.881
The man is pond scum.

15:41.220 --> 15:42.417
Coach?

15:44.054 --> 15:47.752
Stop her. Lock her in the car
if you have to, but stop her.

15:51.806 --> 15:54.970
Sam, I can't stop her. She wants him.

15:55.098 --> 15:57.504
Sam, I haven't forgotten about you.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.260
How about I run to the car
for cloth swatches?

16:00.391 --> 16:03.592
I can be out there
before you can scream no 700 times.

16:03.725 --> 16:06.640
- You better be quick.
- You better be quick.

16:08.851 --> 16:11.803
Coach, let me talk to you.

16:12.518 --> 16:15.351
Do you remember a double-header
against Cleveland

16:15.477 --> 16:18.559
on a hot August day, 1974?

16:18.687 --> 16:20.891
Yeah, I remember part of that.

16:21.020 --> 16:24.303
- What part?
- I remember hot.

16:25.813 --> 16:28.183
Well, that's good.
That's a beginning.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.354
Do you remember I was on the mound?

16:31.481 --> 16:34.930
Johnson had been thrown out.
You filled in as manager.

16:35.065 --> 16:39.190
It was the last inning. I had
just walked. The base was loaded.

16:40.483 --> 16:43.186
- Gosh, who was up?
- Charlie Spikes.

16:43.317 --> 16:44.940
That's it. Charlie Spikes.

16:45.067 --> 16:48.683
Anyway, you came out
to the mound to talk to me.

16:48.818 --> 16:51.733
I was in a jam.
I didn't have any good stuff left.

16:51.860 --> 16:54.645
I thought you were going to yank me
but you didn't.

16:54.778 --> 16:57.978
Instead, you said
that something I've never forgotten.

16:58.112 --> 17:00.150
Do you remember what you said?

17:00.279 --> 17:01.855
What did I say?

17:01.988 --> 17:03.943
You said, "Go get him. "

17:04.780 --> 17:09.818
- I said that?
- Yeah. And I got him, Coach.

17:09.948 --> 17:12.650
Well, I was glad to be there
to help out.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.021
I'm glad you were there, too.

17:15.156 --> 17:18.320
If you hadn't said that,
my career may have ended that day,

17:18.450 --> 17:21.816
instead of when it did,
a couple of weeks later.

17:23.826 --> 17:27.570
What the hell
are we talking about this now for?

17:27.702 --> 17:29.159
Go get him.

17:30.119 --> 17:31.991
- Hi, Daddy.
- Get him.

17:32.119 --> 17:36.244
Lisa, I want to talk to you
about Roy here in Sam's office.

17:42.913 --> 17:47.536
Go get him.
What a marvellously pithy phrase.

17:47.664 --> 17:51.196
That's exactly what
our third baseman said at the time.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.457
I'm sorry, Lisa.

17:56.583 --> 18:02.202
The time has come to put my foot in
my mouth. You cannot marry this man.

18:02.334 --> 18:06.163
You absolutely, positively
cannot marry this man.

18:10.586 --> 18:13.122
I never heard you
talk like this before.

18:13.253 --> 18:17.165
Well, now you have. I'll tell you
something. I don't like this guy Roy.

18:17.296 --> 18:20.709
I don't like Charlie Spikes.
You can't marry either one of them.

18:23.922 --> 18:27.040
Look, Daddy, I'm not dumb.

18:27.173 --> 18:31.333
I know Roy's abrasive.
I know he's insensitive.

18:31.466 --> 18:35.674
I know he's probably only marrying
me so he can get Pennsylvania.

18:36.758 --> 18:40.042
But why would you want
to marry a man like this?

18:40.884 --> 18:42.508
Isn't it obvious to you?

18:43.385 --> 18:45.257
Nothing's ever obvious to me.

18:49.303 --> 18:51.424
Daddy, don't make me say this.

18:52.137 --> 18:53.381
What?

18:54.429 --> 18:57.760
I wanna be married
and I wanna have children.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.505
Roy is the first man
that asked me to marry him

19:02.639 --> 19:04.714
and I'm afraid
he's gonna be the last.

19:05.848 --> 19:10.222
Honey, there must've been dozens
of young fellas that proposed to you.

19:12.183 --> 19:17.221
No, Daddy, wake up.
Roy is the first one ever.

19:18.143 --> 19:22.433
- But you're so beautiful, so...
- Beautiful?

19:22.560 --> 19:24.931
You have been saying
that I'm beautiful

19:25.061 --> 19:27.182
ever since I was a very little girl.

19:27.311 --> 19:29.053
But look at me.

19:29.187 --> 19:32.553
Not as my father. Like you're
looking at me for the first time.

19:32.687 --> 19:36.350
And please try to see me
as I really am.

19:42.856 --> 19:46.721
Oh, my God, I didn't realise
how much you looked like your mother.

19:47.816 --> 19:52.688
I know. I look exactly like her,
and Mom was not...

19:58.777 --> 20:01.230
...comfortable about her beauty.

20:01.902 --> 20:04.569
But that's what made her
more beautiful.

20:07.612 --> 20:10.729
Your mother grew
more beautiful every day of her life.

20:16.030 --> 20:19.527
- She was really beautiful.
- Yes, and so are you.

20:20.115 --> 20:23.113
You're the most beautiful kid
in the whole world.

20:25.574 --> 20:27.032
Thanks, Daddy.

20:30.117 --> 20:31.574
Go ahead.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.656
Come on, go ahead, try it.

20:38.369 --> 20:40.940
The man doesn't lie.
The stuff won't burn.

20:41.077 --> 20:42.736
That's a drawback.

20:48.829 --> 20:49.824
Roy?

20:51.163 --> 20:54.115
About time.
What were you talking about in there?

20:54.247 --> 20:55.989
We were talking about me.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.612
My father thinks I'm beautiful.
Do you?

20:58.748 --> 20:59.910
What?

21:02.332 --> 21:04.158
Of course you're beautiful.

21:04.291 --> 21:08.499
You're stylish, you're contemporary
and you travel well.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.622
You just said that about your suits.

21:13.710 --> 21:16.459
Roy, I don't want to marry you.

21:16.585 --> 21:20.662
I decided that I want a man
as good as my father.

21:23.920 --> 21:27.618
Hold on here.
What about Pennsylvania?

21:28.463 --> 21:33.002
Roy, you don't get Pennsylvania
and you don't get me.

21:33.131 --> 21:35.833
You just get more and more obnoxious.

21:38.632 --> 21:42.757
Look, it's not like this marriage
was gonna change my life.

21:42.883 --> 21:47.506
But I want you to know that if I walk
out that door right now, I'm gone.

21:52.927 --> 21:55.463
Do you hear what I said?

21:55.594 --> 21:57.632
Is that what you want, Lisa?

21:57.761 --> 22:02.005
- That's what I want.
- Then that's what you got.

22:02.804 --> 22:04.345
Goodbye, baby.

22:05.638 --> 22:08.553
Don't bother calling me
cos we're through.

22:09.972 --> 22:12.887
This doesn't mean
we can't put you in a new suit.

22:24.684 --> 22:27.848
You've made me so happy. I mean it.

22:28.809 --> 22:31.843
Care to capture this moment
in a caricature?

22:33.144 --> 22:34.553
No. Tacky.

22:35.853 --> 22:39.100
Come on, let's celebrate.
I'll buy you some ice cream.

22:39.228 --> 22:40.307
Daddy, no.

22:40.437 --> 22:43.638
I'm not in the mood for ice cream.
I just lost my fiancé.

22:43.771 --> 22:47.718
He wasn't the greatest guy, but
it'll take a while to get over it.

22:47.855 --> 22:50.427
- Rocky Road?
- You got it.

22:50.564 --> 22:51.892
- Can we go?
- Take off.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.099
- I got him.
- You got him.

22:56.232 --> 22:57.974
So long, everybody.

22:58.108 --> 23:01.023
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Lisa.

23:03.359 --> 23:05.682
Lisa made the right decision.

23:06.734 --> 23:10.515
- Forgive my storybook mentality...
- You're forgiven.

23:14.319 --> 23:16.192
Well, laugh if you will.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.192
Every woman has a Mr Right in mind.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.988
It's a mistake
to settle for anyone less.

23:21.113 --> 23:24.064
Do you have a Mr Right in mind?

23:25.905 --> 23:29.686
Well, I suppose I do.
Every woman does.

23:29.823 --> 23:32.608
- What's he like?
- Come on.

23:32.740 --> 23:36.687
No, come on, maybe I know the guy.
Maybe I know him real well...

23:40.200 --> 23:44.065
Well, for one thing,
he would be very intelligent.

23:44.201 --> 23:45.611
Very well educated.

23:45.743 --> 23:48.493
Perhaps overeducated,
if there is such a thing.

23:48.619 --> 23:53.443
Not particularly athletic, perhaps
even clumsy, but charmingly so.

23:53.578 --> 23:57.987
Blond, blue-eyed,
with a Byron-like innocence.

23:59.246 --> 24:02.659
- I know this person.
- Who?

24:02.788 --> 24:04.910
You.
You described yourself perfectly.

24:05.039 --> 24:07.196
I hope you'll be very happy together.

24:07.581 --> 24:09.905
- I have had enough...
- Don't throw that.

24:10.040 --> 24:13.537
That's Herbie. He's got a wife
and four little shot glasses.
