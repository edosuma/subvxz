42:48.100 --> 42:50.200
I can't do it.
I won't eat that.

42:50.233 --> 42:51.667
- Tonight,
I want to get to know Jen.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.133
You could measure

42:53.166 --> 42:54.600
the things that I do to her.

42:54.633 --> 42:56.533
- You're a f---ing idiot.
- Whatever, whore!

42:56.567 --> 42:58.066
- Where the f--- do you get off
calling someone a whore?

42:58.066 --> 42:59.266
- You're a f---ing liar.

42:59.300 --> 43:01.000
I don't need this sh--!

43:01.033 --> 43:02.700
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:02.734 --> 43:05.734
