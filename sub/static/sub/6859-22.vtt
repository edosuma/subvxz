20:51.298 --> 20:53.365
Now would be a good time!

20:53.433 --> 20:55.366
Blast!

20:58.003 --> 21:00.971
[Loud whooshing]

21:15.853 --> 21:19.723
That was cutting it a little close.

21:19.758 --> 21:21.525
You do know it's not over.

21:21.594 --> 21:22.893
I know.

21:22.929 --> 21:25.496
They'll be after us both now.

21:31.504 --> 21:32.871
What now, brother?

21:32.907 --> 21:35.074
Do we go after them?

21:35.109 --> 21:36.675
No.

21:36.711 --> 21:39.612
We will be patient, Savage.

21:39.680 --> 21:44.049
I've waited so many
years for my revenge.

21:44.085 --> 21:46.785
I can wait a little longer.

21:46.905 --> 21:49.158
But the Jedi will know that you survived.

21:49.278 --> 21:51.184
They will be coming for us.

21:55.244 --> 21:57.801
I am counting on it.
