01:07.949 --> 01:10.282
We got another dust devil.
Come on.

01:10.369 --> 01:12.563
Ugh! That's
the third one today.

01:12.650 --> 01:14.509
Well, the conditions
are perfect.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.033
Fair skies, no wind.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.605
Hot air rises and starts
to rotate and...

01:18.692 --> 01:20.074
<i>Hapana!</i>

01:21.726 --> 01:23.423
It's headed for Ukuni Woods.

01:23.510 --> 01:25.030
That's where the hyraxes live.

01:25.117 --> 01:27.212
They better hang on
to their branches.

01:36.666 --> 01:37.853
Hurry!

01:38.260 --> 01:40.802
Here come the hyraxes!

01:41.048 --> 01:42.321
Gotcha!

01:43.196 --> 01:44.880
And I got you.

01:46.438 --> 01:47.940
There it goes.

01:52.056 --> 01:54.672
They don't last long,
but they sure make a mess.

01:54.759 --> 01:56.442
There you go,
little guy.

01:58.894 --> 02:01.756
And I think
this is yours.

02:03.734 --> 02:07.153
Something tells me we're gonna
be chasing these things all day.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.652
Great! I love
catching hyraxes.

02:09.740 --> 02:11.724
I think Kion meant
the dust devils.

02:11.811 --> 02:14.226
Right. Ono, keep an eye out.

02:14.313 --> 02:15.931
Affirmative.

02:16.091 --> 02:18.770
Lion Guard?
Excuse me.

02:18.857 --> 02:20.510
We need to talk.

02:20.597 --> 02:21.964
Do we have to?

02:22.051 --> 02:25.461
I know what you're thinking, but
we should at least check it out.

02:25.598 --> 02:26.923
Is there a problem?

02:27.010 --> 02:29.104
I should say there is.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.728
That dust devil
mussed my mane.

02:31.815 --> 02:34.297
And I got hit by a leaf.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.215
The Lion Guard needs to stop
those dust devils,

02:37.302 --> 02:38.916
so it doesn't happen again.

02:39.003 --> 02:40.121
I wish we could,

02:40.208 --> 02:42.820
but nobody knows when
a dust devil's gonna happen,

02:42.907 --> 02:44.308
or where it's gonna go.

02:44.395 --> 02:47.857
Then you should stay
on the alert.

02:47.944 --> 02:49.441
Everyone! Everyone!

02:49.528 --> 02:52.449
Another dust devil
on the Chakula Plains!

02:52.536 --> 02:55.340
We got to go now.
Thanks for the advice.

02:55.427 --> 02:57.646
Lion Guard, let's move.

02:57.853 --> 02:59.694
Yes, that's right.

02:59.781 --> 03:02.262
Get moving, Lion Guard.

03:02.419 --> 03:04.106
Did you see that?

03:04.193 --> 03:06.275
I gave the Lion Guard advice,

03:06.362 --> 03:09.012
and they did just
what I suggested.

03:10.284 --> 03:13.784
I don't know what the Lion Guard
would do if it wasn't for me.

03:13.871 --> 03:16.441
In fact, I think you could say

03:16.528 --> 03:20.189

Yeah. Who knew
zebras could dance?

04:46.028 --> 04:50.245
And who knew a zebra was the
brains behind the Lion Guard.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.473
I wonder what it would be like
being smart like that.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.067
If we were smart,

04:55.154 --> 04:58.051
we'd be in that big meeting
with Janja and Scar.

04:58.138 --> 05:00.270
The one Janja said
we couldn't go to

05:00.357 --> 05:02.215
'cause we're not smart enough?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.455
Yeah.

05:03.542 --> 05:06.489
They're trying to figure out
how to beat the Lion Guard.

05:06.576 --> 05:11.589
Oh! Ooh! But that zebra is the
brains behind the Lion Guard.

05:11.676 --> 05:13.172
Oh, yeah!

05:13.259 --> 05:15.804
If we took that zebra
to Scar,

05:15.891 --> 05:19.236
the Lion Guard wouldn't be
smart no more!

05:20.354 --> 05:23.646
Cheezi, didn't we
just get an idea?

05:23.733 --> 05:25.750
Our very first one.

05:25.837 --> 05:28.330
Let's go get that zebra.

05:28.958 --> 05:31.322
I'm not in the grazing mood
anymore.

05:31.409 --> 05:33.055
Ta-ta for now.

05:33.310 --> 05:35.965
Psst. Hey, you, Zebra.

05:36.052 --> 05:37.971
You're coming with us.

05:38.058 --> 05:40.012
Oh, hello there.

05:40.099 --> 05:41.630
Haven't we met before?

05:41.717 --> 05:44.936
Well, we did try to eat you
once when we were lost.

05:45.023 --> 05:46.602
Oh, yes!

05:46.771 --> 05:49.227
But you didn't, right?

05:49.314 --> 05:50.649
I guess not.

05:50.736 --> 05:51.856
Fabulous.

05:51.943 --> 05:54.535
Now, what's all this
about going somewhere?

05:54.622 --> 05:58.947
We're taking you
to a big, uh, party!

05:59.034 --> 06:02.787
Yeah, right! And
you'll be the guest of honor.

06:02.874 --> 06:05.543
Marvelous!
Will there be snacks?

06:05.630 --> 06:07.783
There will be
if you're there.

06:07.870 --> 06:11.009
Sounds like fun.
Lead the way.

06:11.521 --> 06:14.863
I can honestly tell you
I was not looking forward

06:14.950 --> 06:17.142
to another afternoon
with the herd.

06:17.229 --> 06:18.804
Oh, they're nice and all...

06:22.958 --> 06:24.359
There goes another one.

06:24.446 --> 06:25.863
Bye-bye, dust devil.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.965
What's the damage?
Anybody hurt?

06:28.052 --> 06:29.080
Over here!

06:29.167 --> 06:30.236
It's a pangolin.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.189
He's rolled up
under all this stuff.

06:32.276 --> 06:34.416
Aw. Poor little fella.

06:34.503 --> 06:38.087
Actually, it's a very
effective defense strategy.

06:38.552 --> 06:41.798
You can relax now.
The danger's passed.

06:44.607 --> 06:46.036
You okay?

06:47.356 --> 06:49.166
Were there other
pangolins with you?

06:50.841 --> 06:52.603
They could have
rolled off anywhere.

06:52.690 --> 06:54.756
Ono.
On it.

06:56.065 --> 06:59.311
Say, have I been here before?

06:59.398 --> 07:02.418
I think you was here
with the Lion Guard once.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.514
Hm. Perhaps
I led them here.

07:05.601 --> 07:09.184
Finding their way around is not
one of their strong points.

07:09.271 --> 07:12.418
Wait, wait, wait! The Lion
Guard's got weak point?

07:12.505 --> 07:14.859
Oh hoh! My, yes.

07:14.946 --> 07:16.694
Uh, like what?

07:16.781 --> 07:19.491
Well, like flowers.

07:19.578 --> 07:20.984
Flowers?

07:21.109 --> 07:24.184
Once, we were in a field
of fluffy red flowers,

07:24.271 --> 07:28.530
just one sniff and they all
started sneezing and sneezing,

07:28.617 --> 07:31.365
and sneezing.

07:31.452 --> 07:35.397
They were so overcome
from sneezing that anyone,

07:35.484 --> 07:37.281
anyone could've beaten them.

07:37.368 --> 07:38.447
Anyone?

07:38.534 --> 07:40.795
Chungu, come here.

07:41.704 --> 07:42.818
You hear that?

07:42.905 --> 07:45.379
When the Lion Guard
sniffed them flowers

07:45.466 --> 07:47.073
anyone can beat 'em.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.345
Uh, so?

07:48.455 --> 07:50.007
We're anyone.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.999
Oh, yeah. We are!

07:52.086 --> 07:54.842
So, instead of
giving Scar the zebra,

07:54.929 --> 07:57.668
what if we gave him
the Lion Guard?

07:57.755 --> 08:00.235
Ooh, he'd like that
even better!

08:00.322 --> 08:04.967
And all we got to do is stick flowers
under the Lion Guard's noses.

08:05.054 --> 08:08.343
Uh, hey, zebra.
We got to go, um,

08:08.430 --> 08:10.500
do something real important.

08:10.587 --> 08:12.356
So, we need you
to stay here, okay?

08:12.443 --> 08:14.618
And then we'll go
to the party?

08:14.705 --> 08:17.394
Yeah. Yeah, the party.
Right.

08:17.481 --> 08:20.152
So, do not go anywhere, okay?

08:20.239 --> 08:23.228
I will be right here
when you return.

08:23.315 --> 08:24.608
Zebra's honor.

08:24.695 --> 08:28.975
Uh, and, uh, where did you say
those flowers were.

08:29.062 --> 08:31.356
The ones that make
the Lion Guard sneeze.

08:31.443 --> 08:34.288
Ah, yes. They're right
next to the place

08:34.375 --> 08:36.640
with that big thing
with all that stuff on it.

08:36.727 --> 08:38.864
Oh, yeah.
I know that place.

08:38.951 --> 08:42.177
Then let's get going!
Come on!

08:42.264 --> 08:45.200
I hope they don't bring
any of those flowers here.

08:45.287 --> 08:48.728
I'm not fond of the smell,
and they make me sneeze.

08:48.859 --> 08:49.985
Wait!

08:50.082 --> 08:53.493
Was it the Lion Guard
who sneezed at the flowers

08:53.580 --> 08:55.760
or was it me?
Oh, well.

08:55.847 --> 08:58.781
Either way, it makes for
a fascinating story.

08:58.901 --> 09:01.676
<i>Twende Kiboko!</i>

09:01.957 --> 09:05.234
Hey, pangy-angolin.
Everything is okay now.

09:05.321 --> 09:07.369
You're good to unroll
and relax.

09:07.456 --> 09:09.540
He might be more
willing to relax

09:09.627 --> 09:11.256
if you stop shaking him.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.685
Mm. Good point.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.681
Aw.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.183
I love a happy ending.

09:22.840 --> 09:26.168
Then we will give you an
ending you will not forget.

09:26.255 --> 09:28.665
Yeah, that's right.

09:28.752 --> 09:30.395
Cheezi? Chungu?

09:30.482 --> 09:33.431
What's going on you two?
Where's Janja?

09:33.518 --> 09:35.764
Give it up, Lion Guard.

09:35.851 --> 09:38.569
Yeah. Or you're gonna
get this.

09:40.571 --> 09:42.237
What are they doing?

09:42.324 --> 09:44.200
It looks like
they brought us flowers.

09:44.287 --> 09:46.047
Should we have gotten
them something?

09:46.134 --> 09:48.765
That's right!
We got flowers

09:48.852 --> 09:51.348
and we ain't afraid to use them.

09:51.435 --> 09:55.372
We warned you,
now take that.

09:55.459 --> 09:56.685
And that!

09:56.772 --> 09:58.371
And that, and that!

09:58.653 --> 10:01.804
Yeah!
Oh, we got you now!

10:02.859 --> 10:03.984
Are they attacking us?

10:04.052 --> 10:05.757
How do you like that?

10:06.005 --> 10:07.019
Maybe?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.484
Your turn.

10:09.666 --> 10:11.297
Are you done?

10:11.444 --> 10:15.556
Chungu, the flowers ain't
making them sneeze at all.

10:16.369 --> 10:17.916
They're not?

10:18.478 --> 10:19.581
Stop it!

10:19.668 --> 10:21.712
I don't know why you
want us to sneeze,

10:21.799 --> 10:23.462
but we're putting
an end to it.

10:23.549 --> 10:25.950
Thanks for the flowers.
Now, beat it.

10:27.755 --> 10:29.481
Let's get out of here!

10:29.864 --> 10:31.070
Good idea.

10:31.306 --> 10:33.121
<i>Twende Kiboko!</i>

10:36.363 --> 10:39.129
Why didn't the flowers
make 'em all sneezy?

10:39.216 --> 10:42.143
Maybe we picked the wrong
kind of flowers?

10:44.686 --> 10:46.435
That was... different.

10:46.522 --> 10:49.321
Yeah. I wonder what
they were really up to.

10:50.126 --> 10:52.535
<i>Hapana!</i> No time to wonder.

10:52.622 --> 10:54.511
We've got another dust devil.

10:54.598 --> 10:56.357
Lion Guard, let's go.

10:59.638 --> 11:01.165
Goigoi! Wake up!

11:01.252 --> 11:02.533
Huh?

11:02.620 --> 11:05.043
Honey Paws?
Why you roustin' me?

11:05.130 --> 11:08.350
Scar's called a big meeting
for all of the pack leaders.

11:09.082 --> 11:11.473
Okay, okay.
I'ma comin'.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.586
You're not invited.
I'm not? Phew!

11:15.598 --> 11:17.785
What is it now,
Sugar Snout?

11:17.872 --> 11:20.371
I woke you, 'cause I want you
to round up some supper.

11:20.458 --> 11:21.972
Me? Hunt?

11:22.059 --> 11:25.746
That's right. Make yourself
useful for a change.

11:25.833 --> 11:27.580
If I come back
and find no food,

11:27.667 --> 11:29.676
I better not find you
here either,

11:29.763 --> 11:31.688
you do-nothing lollygagger!

11:31.775 --> 11:34.207
Do-nothing? Lollygagger?

11:34.294 --> 11:36.219
It's like she thinks
I can't do nothing.

11:36.306 --> 11:38.387
Well, I'll show her.

11:38.474 --> 11:41.035
I'll do something
so amazing...

11:41.710 --> 11:44.840
Hmm, I'll be
a baboon's brother.

11:44.927 --> 11:48.624
That there is a month's
worth of fine dining.

11:50.294 --> 11:54.215
Once I bring it home, Reirei will
have to admit I've done something.

11:56.239 --> 11:58.642
Oh! Well, hello there.

11:58.729 --> 12:01.743
Eh... Howdy, stranger.

12:01.830 --> 12:05.572
What's a big juicy, uh... handsome
fella like you doing in these parts?

12:05.659 --> 12:07.996
I am waiting for
my hyena friends.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.875
They're taking me
to a big party.

12:10.962 --> 12:12.580
- A party?
- Yes.

12:12.667 --> 12:15.902
Because I'm an expert
on the Lion Guard.

12:15.989 --> 12:19.697
The hyenas especially enjoyed
hearing about their weaknesses.

12:19.784 --> 12:22.366
The Lion Guard has weaknesses?

12:22.453 --> 12:23.575
Oh, yes.

12:23.678 --> 12:26.201
You know, sometimes
they run right past me,

12:26.288 --> 12:27.658
like they don't see me
at all.

12:27.745 --> 12:29.473
It's my stripes, of course.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.486
They make me invisible
to lots of animals,

12:32.573 --> 12:34.738
including the Lion Guard.

12:34.825 --> 12:36.283
Invisible, huh?

12:36.370 --> 12:38.549
So, you can say you sneak
up on all of them,

12:38.636 --> 12:40.170
and they never see you coming?

12:40.257 --> 12:42.293
Well, perhaps.
But you see there's...

12:42.380 --> 12:45.456
So your stripes would let you take
the whole Lion Guard by surprise

12:45.543 --> 12:47.246
and defeat them
all by yourself?

12:47.333 --> 12:48.759
I suppose.

12:48.846 --> 12:51.460
But why would anyone
want to do that?

12:51.547 --> 12:53.931
'Cause it would really
be doing something,

12:54.018 --> 12:56.877
and then Reirei would know
I ain't a do-nothing.

12:56.964 --> 12:58.276
I see.

12:58.453 --> 12:59.801
Who's Reirei?

12:59.888 --> 13:01.283
Wait here till I get back.

13:01.370 --> 13:04.610
I'm gonna make you a big part
of my victory celebration.

13:04.712 --> 13:07.164
Wonder where I could
get me some stripes?

13:07.251 --> 13:08.508
Hmm.

13:08.595 --> 13:12.871
I wonder if I told my stripes
only make me invisible

13:12.958 --> 13:15.508
when I'm surrounded
by other zebras?

13:15.739 --> 13:18.383
Oh, well. I'll tell him
at the party.

13:25.045 --> 13:27.770
That's right.
Keep going, dust devil.

13:27.857 --> 13:29.403
The Lion Guard's here.

13:35.679 --> 13:37.670
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

13:37.757 --> 13:39.200
What happened to you guys?

13:39.287 --> 13:42.204
The dust devil
caught us in this gully.

13:42.291 --> 13:47.522
At least, it was a gully
until all the sand blew in.

13:47.609 --> 13:50.612
Don't worry.
We'll have you out in no time.

14:04.086 --> 14:05.538
What do you know?

14:05.625 --> 14:08.138
These red berry stripes
really work.

14:08.225 --> 14:09.855
Goigoi?

14:10.359 --> 14:12.520
Eh, keep doing
what you're doing.

14:12.607 --> 14:13.765
Nothing to see here.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.773
Just an invisible jackal.

14:15.860 --> 14:18.928
Uh, Goigoi, what makes
you think you're invisible?

14:19.015 --> 14:20.754
'Cause I got stripes.

14:20.841 --> 14:23.617
And the Lion Guard can't see
critters with stripes on 'em.

14:23.704 --> 14:25.128
You think I'm here,

14:25.288 --> 14:27.169
but I'm really here.

14:27.256 --> 14:29.483
Or am I here?
Who knows?

14:29.570 --> 14:31.628
Maybe I'm right up
in your face.

14:31.715 --> 14:33.491
You have no idea.

14:33.578 --> 14:37.163
You're about to get whooped
and you won't even see it c...

14:39.125 --> 14:41.530
That ain't fair!

14:41.617 --> 14:44.112
I'm supposed to be invisible.

14:44.793 --> 14:46.792
What's with all these
crazy attacks?

14:46.879 --> 14:49.605
I don't know. It doesn't
make any sense.

14:50.210 --> 14:54.428
So did Kiburi say why we
couldn't go to Scar's big meeting?

14:54.515 --> 14:57.641
Yeah. Something about
us having fish for brains.

14:57.728 --> 14:59.514
Hey, speaking about fish,

14:59.601 --> 15:01.171
let's go find something
to eat.

15:01.258 --> 15:04.628
Ooh! That sounds good.
What you in the mood for?

15:04.715 --> 15:07.749
Hyrax? Lizard?
Mole rat?

15:07.836 --> 15:10.607
Uh, how 'bout a zebra?

15:10.694 --> 15:13.362
Tamka, there ain't no zebras
in the Outlands.

15:13.449 --> 15:15.249
So what about him?

15:18.798 --> 15:20.887
Shh. If we're quiet,

15:20.974 --> 15:24.003
he'll be leftovers
by the time he wakes up.

15:26.014 --> 15:27.124
Huh?

15:27.211 --> 15:29.350
Oh, now you woke him.

15:29.437 --> 15:33.837
Who me? I wasn't asleep.
I was merely resting my eyes.

15:33.924 --> 15:35.886
Ain't you gonna panic
and run?

15:35.999 --> 15:39.061
What? And miss
the big party?

15:39.148 --> 15:41.585
Party? Eh, you mean
the big meeting?

15:41.672 --> 15:42.871
You were invited?

15:42.958 --> 15:46.327
Not just invited,
I am the guest of honor.

15:46.414 --> 15:49.491
Because I'm the Pride Lands
Lion Guard expert.

15:49.578 --> 15:51.542
I know everything about them.

15:51.629 --> 15:52.709
Everything?

15:52.796 --> 15:54.874
Oh, let me guess.

15:54.961 --> 15:57.887
You want to hear about
their weak points, too.

15:57.974 --> 15:59.289
Uh, okay.

15:59.398 --> 16:01.983
Although, I'm sort of
running out of them...

16:02.070 --> 16:03.553
Oh! I know!

16:03.640 --> 16:06.692
I heard somewhere
that if you rub their tummies,

16:06.779 --> 16:09.256
they'll all fall
fast asleep.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.906
- You believe it?
- Sure.

16:10.993 --> 16:12.528
I mean, it works on me.

16:12.615 --> 16:14.799
Hey, we should
tell Kiburi.

16:14.906 --> 16:17.371
No! We ought to fight
the Lion Guard.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.938
Put 'em to sleep and
hand them over to Scar

16:20.025 --> 16:21.485
all by ourselves.

16:21.572 --> 16:25.527
Then maybe next time,
we'll get to go to the big meeting.

16:25.614 --> 16:26.879
Yeah, good idea.

16:26.966 --> 16:28.364
See you around,
zebra.

16:28.451 --> 16:30.447
Ta-ta, crocodiles.

16:30.534 --> 16:32.086
Oh, yes.

16:32.187 --> 16:35.823
Rubbing my tummy
always puts me to sleep.

16:37.882 --> 16:41.660
Gracious!
Was I talking about me again?

16:42.121 --> 16:43.171
Oh, well...

16:43.258 --> 16:46.733
Don't worry, Mbuni,
I'm almost there!

16:48.978 --> 16:50.675
Oh, at last.

16:51.554 --> 16:54.780
Thank you, Lion Guard.
Thank you.

16:54.867 --> 16:56.155
Just doing our job.

16:56.242 --> 17:00.284
We won't be needing another
dust-bath for a while.

17:00.390 --> 17:03.170
Okay, everybody,
time for a break.

17:03.257 --> 17:04.593
Sounds good to me.

17:05.631 --> 17:07.742
Oh, come on!
Now, these guys?

17:09.660 --> 17:11.233
Seriously?

17:12.707 --> 17:14.077
What do you want?

17:14.164 --> 17:15.950
You'll see soon enough!

17:16.037 --> 17:18.999
That's right!
We're gonna put you...

17:19.086 --> 17:22.777
- to sleep.
- What in the Pride Lands?

17:22.891 --> 17:25.700
Sleep.

17:25.787 --> 17:27.769
What kind of fighting
do you call this?

17:27.856 --> 17:30.004
Uh, Tamka,
this ain't working.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.503
Keep trying. Maybe,
it takes a while to kick in.

17:32.590 --> 17:34.881
You're getting sleepy.

17:34.968 --> 17:36.824
When you guys wake up,

17:36.911 --> 17:38.813
you'll be facing Scar.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.083
Are they serious?

17:40.170 --> 17:41.616
Apparently so.

17:41.703 --> 17:43.418
So, go to sleep already!

17:43.505 --> 17:46.954
Yeah, we rubbed your tubbies.
Why're you still awake?

17:47.041 --> 17:49.359
That's why you're trying
to rub out tummies?

17:49.446 --> 17:51.667
What's going on
with you guys today?

17:51.754 --> 17:54.475
- Sleepy...
- That's it!

17:59.522 --> 18:01.581
I can't
wait to get home.

18:01.668 --> 18:05.054
- I'm still aching all over.
- Me too.

18:05.193 --> 18:07.631
That Beshte doesn't
know his own...

18:07.718 --> 18:10.064
You hear something?

18:11.833 --> 18:14.466
Goigoi, what is
wrong with you?

18:14.553 --> 18:16.674
I ran into the Lion Guard.

18:16.770 --> 18:19.721
Or the Lion Guard ran into me!

18:19.808 --> 18:21.459
What happened to you?

18:21.546 --> 18:25.093
We got bounced around
good by the Lion Guard.

18:25.180 --> 18:29.476
And it's all that lousy,
no-good, zebras fault.

18:29.563 --> 18:33.737
Zebra? Did that donkey with
stripes trick you guys too?

18:33.824 --> 18:35.036
He sure did.

18:35.123 --> 18:40.201
That snooty, striped bag of
hot air is good for nothing!

18:40.288 --> 18:41.778
Except for eating maybe.

18:41.865 --> 18:44.612
That's the first good idea
I've heard all day.

18:44.699 --> 18:46.886
Then what are
we waiting for?

18:46.973 --> 18:49.400
It's lunchtime!

18:50.358 --> 18:52.354
Kion? What's
the kurbubble?

18:52.441 --> 18:54.357
All those crazy attacks.

18:54.444 --> 18:57.568
Scar's got to be up to something.
But what?

18:57.655 --> 18:59.708
What makes you think
Scar's involved?

18:59.795 --> 19:03.871
'Cause those guys don't do anything
unless somebody smarter tells them to.

19:03.958 --> 19:07.882
But why would Scar send them
after us on such silly missions?

19:07.969 --> 19:10.393
Maybe he's up to something
really big,

19:10.480 --> 19:13.025
and he's just trying
to keep us distracted.

19:13.112 --> 19:15.172
Ono, take a look
at the Outlands.

19:15.259 --> 19:16.794
See if there's anything
going on.

19:16.881 --> 19:18.473
Affirmative.

19:20.340 --> 19:21.573
Hmm.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.027
Oh!

19:25.939 --> 19:27.633
That doesn't look good.

19:29.444 --> 19:31.351
No sign of any big attack.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.785
But I did see a zebra
in the Outlands.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.250
- A zebra?
- Yes.

19:35.337 --> 19:39.083
And he's surrounded by Chungu,
Cheezi, Goigoi, Tamka, and Nduli.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.771
Did you recognize the zebra?

19:40.858 --> 19:42.293
It was, uh...

19:42.424 --> 19:45.184
"Panic and run!
Panic and run!"

19:45.271 --> 19:46.563
That guy?

19:46.704 --> 19:48.302
I know what you're thinking, Fuli.

19:48.389 --> 19:50.142
But he's still
a Pride Lander.

19:50.229 --> 19:52.503
We've got to save him.
Come on!

19:52.590 --> 19:55.406
Now are we going
to this party or not?

19:55.493 --> 19:57.285
Don't worry, zebra.

19:57.372 --> 19:59.656
We're gonna have a party,
all right.

19:59.743 --> 20:01.273
Listen, if we're
gonna do this,

20:01.360 --> 20:02.804
there's got to be
a fair split.

20:02.891 --> 20:05.755
How's about the hyenas
get the ribs and brisket,

20:05.842 --> 20:08.865
the crocs get the shanks
and I get the rump.

20:08.952 --> 20:11.091
No way! We want the rump.

20:11.178 --> 20:14.390
- I want a wing.
- I couldn't help but overhear.

20:14.477 --> 20:16.896
If you want to know the
tastiest part of a zebra,

20:16.983 --> 20:18.437
ask a zebra.

20:18.524 --> 20:22.289
Now, I've always been told
that my tri-tip is espe...

20:22.376 --> 20:23.953
Shut it, zebra.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.616
We're sick of your
ridiculous stories.

20:26.703 --> 20:29.703
Well, no need
to be rude.

20:29.790 --> 20:32.598
I'm just trying to be
entertaining and informative.

20:32.688 --> 20:34.880
I don't even know
what those words mean.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.560
Back off and hush up.

20:36.647 --> 20:37.998
Now, where were we?

20:38.085 --> 20:40.228
Figuring out
who gets the wing.

20:40.315 --> 20:41.640
Excuse me.

20:41.727 --> 20:44.883
Yoo-hoo.
One last word of advice?

20:45.493 --> 20:46.660
What?

20:46.747 --> 20:48.722
Panic and run.

20:48.809 --> 20:52.215
- That's three words.
- But its good advice.

20:52.414 --> 20:54.519
We're here to take
the zebra home.

20:54.634 --> 20:56.513
Don't make is do it
the hard way.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.887
You don't scare us,
Lion Guard. Bring it on!

20:59.974 --> 21:01.788
You asked for it.

21:04.166 --> 21:05.642
- <i>Huwezi!</i>
- Ooh!

21:05.720 --> 21:07.781
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

21:07.868 --> 21:10.164
<i>Twende Kiboko!</i>

21:10.586 --> 21:13.078
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

21:14.305 --> 21:16.318
The zebra was right
for a change.

21:16.405 --> 21:17.726
Panic and run!

21:20.288 --> 21:22.439
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

21:22.526 --> 21:25.687
Where are they going?
We were headed for a party.

21:25.774 --> 21:27.577
They invited you
to a party?

21:27.664 --> 21:31.433
That's right. They all wanted
to talk to me about you.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.917
Like how flowers
make us sneeze?

21:34.004 --> 21:35.587
Well...

21:35.674 --> 21:37.385
Or that we can't
see stripes.

21:37.472 --> 21:39.589
Or if you rub our tummies,
we fall asleep.

21:39.676 --> 21:43.165
Perhaps I may have mentioned
something along those lines.

21:43.252 --> 21:44.761
Ever think you might
talk too much?

21:44.848 --> 21:45.783
Me?

21:45.870 --> 21:47.330
Come on, let's go home.

21:47.417 --> 21:50.330
Well, perhaps I do talk
a tad too much.

21:50.417 --> 21:51.749
But I can do better.

21:51.836 --> 21:54.197
In fact, I'll start right now.

21:54.284 --> 21:56.387
You'll see, I won't
make a peep.

21:56.474 --> 21:58.006
Not a peep!

21:58.093 --> 22:01.114
Nope, not a single peep
from me. You're not...
