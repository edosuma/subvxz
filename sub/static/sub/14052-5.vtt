WEBVTT

00:51.800 --> 00:54.880
It was a... A moment of madness.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.240
She was pretty and, er,

01:00.000 --> 01:01.280
I was a fool.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.640
Who was she?

01:02.680 --> 01:03.920
Some intern.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.280
-Mum!

01:07.280 --> 01:09.040
I have a right to know.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.480
The conference in Mexico.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.280
I am going to have to resign.

01:15.320 --> 01:19.120
-We shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.

01:15.320 --> 01:19.120
-No, I'll have no choice.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.040
Let's see how the papers run with it tomorrow.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.880
What about, "The Minister accepts

01:27.920 --> 01:29.800
"full responsibility for his actions..."

01:29.840 --> 01:31.520
CHARLOTTE: Darling, why don't you go to bed?

01:34.600 --> 01:35.920
I'm going to get some air.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.880
He'll be all right. Don't worry.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.720
Where have you been?

02:12.880 --> 02:14.920
Okay, they're running it.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.560
Whoever leaked this was out to destroy me.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.560
You don't have to do this.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.880
I can resign now or I can wait to be sacked.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.240
Thank you all for your support.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.640
I've got a letter to write.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.040
Sir, are you all right

03:07.600 --> 03:08.800
Oh, Jacob!

03:08.840 --> 03:10.120
Dad?

03:10.160 --> 03:11.200
Dad!

03:47.600 --> 03:49.240
So, what do you think?

03:50.280 --> 03:51.480
Where is everything?

03:51.520 --> 03:53.480
Tidied away, Camille.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.600
Yes, but where, sir?

03:55.640 --> 03:59.200
"A place for everything, everything in its place."

03:59.240 --> 04:00.400
What brought this on?

04:00.440 --> 04:01.840
Oh, er, nothing.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.040
Sorry?

04:03.080 --> 04:05.440
Come on, Chief. There's got to be a reason.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.480
-Okay, if you must know... -Mmm-hmm.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.760
...I got up this morning and I couldn't find my trousers.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.360
I know that feeling.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.280
Yes, very funny.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.000
And I realised, I never know where anything is.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.080
You have to control your environment

04:20.040 --> 04:23.080
or it controls you.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.600
Oh, you've bought a self

04:26.640 --> 04:28.120
A tidy mind breeds a tidy

04:28.160 --> 04:29.800
something-something, Camille.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.040
I think your desk is ringing, Chief.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.640
I seem to have lost my phone.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.720
Don't worry, sir, I'll get it.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.800
You've got to have a system or otherwise it's just mess.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.920
Right, hold on.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.600
Erm, sir, there's been a shooting.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.600
It sounds like a suicide. So, the day

04:50.640 --> 04:53.600
a Government Minister's exposed as having an affair...

04:56.040 --> 04:58.520
Er, not much. His name's Jacob Doran.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.280
What was he like?

05:00.320 --> 05:03.160
Very popular, charismatic, a great ambassador

05:00.320 --> 05:03.160
for the island.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.240
Any wife and kids?

05:07.280 --> 05:10.240
One wife, Charlotte, and one son, Drew, I think.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.200
So what d'you think our chances are of getting

05:12.240 --> 05:15.200
in and out of here without any interference from top brass?

05:15.240 --> 05:18.560
-Detective Inspector. -Ah, Commissioner,

05:15.240 --> 05:18.560
so pleased to see you.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.640
Sir!

05:25.080 --> 05:26.800
So, what have we got?

05:26.840 --> 05:31.000
Well, sir, I've spoken to Mr Doran's Press Secretary,

05:26.840 --> 05:31.000
Theo Frazier.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.240
He said he found the body at about 7:00 a.m. this morning.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.960
He shot himself in the chest,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.720
-and the gun's on the floor where he dropped it.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.640
Yes, there is.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.520
"...the shame I brought to my office, to my family,

05:41.560 --> 05:44.360
"the only honourable action I can take is to end my life."

05:44.400 --> 05:45.560
His handwriting?

05:45.600 --> 05:46.640
Looks that way.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.720
And this is the gun?

05:50.560 --> 05:52.800
Interesting, the serial number's been filed off,

05:52.840 --> 05:54.400
this is an illegal gun.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.040
I wonder where he got it from?

05:56.080 --> 05:57.360
We don't know.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.480
The safe's open...

05:58.520 --> 06:00.040
What's in it?

06:00.080 --> 06:02.400
Well, the wife said there should be a

06:00.080 --> 06:02.400
few thousand dollars

06:02.440 --> 06:04.000
in cash, but there's no money,

06:04.920 --> 06:06.200
and there's something else.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.920
The family kept their passports here.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.080
Here's the wife's one, here's the son's,

06:12.120 --> 06:13.840
but the Minister's passport is missing.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.640
Mmm, so...

06:17.040 --> 06:18.560
It's all a bit odd...

06:18.600 --> 06:20.280
What are you thinking?

06:20.320 --> 06:23.680
The Minister came in here, wrote the letter,

06:20.320 --> 06:23.680
got out his gun

06:23.720 --> 06:25.000
and then... Pop?

06:25.040 --> 06:27.160
Yes, it's what it looks like, isn't it?

06:27.200 --> 06:30.040
-Well, it's the

06:27.200 --> 06:30.040
bullet hole, sir.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.000
That's the problem. You see, in my experience,

06:32.040 --> 06:34.720
suicides rarely ever shoot themselves through

06:32.040 --> 06:34.720
their clothes.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.280
They put the gun muzzle against their skin

06:36.320 --> 06:38.440
like they want to make sure they don't miss.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.440
It's macabre, but it's one of those things...

06:42.440 --> 06:45.040
...whereas this bullet's gone through a thick jacket,

06:45.080 --> 06:48.720
some old notes from a speech, it would appear,

06:45.080 --> 06:48.720
a shirt and a vest.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.320
Fidel, swab the, er, Minister's hands

06:59.400 --> 07:02.320
for gunshot residue?

07:02.360 --> 07:04.680
-I want to see whether he's fired the gun at all.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.680
-Yes, sir.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.120
Then search the grounds outside.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.600
See if there's any evidence of an intruder.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.680
If he didn't take his own life, how come there

07:10.120 --> 07:13.680
was a suicide note?

07:13.720 --> 07:16.400
Well, maybe he was forced to write it

07:13.720 --> 07:16.400
or it's a fake,

07:16.440 --> 07:19.960
but I don't think this is a suicide. It's just been

07:16.440 --> 07:19.960
staged to look like one.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.440
If you ask me, this is murder.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.280
May I introduce Detective Inspector

07:22.480 --> 07:25.280
Humphrey Goodman

07:25.320 --> 07:27.480
and Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.360
Hello.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.160
I'm sorry for your loss, this must be a terrible time

07:29.400 --> 07:32.160
for you all,

07:32.200 --> 07:35.440
-but we do have to ask a few questions.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.440
-Of course.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.960
I understand that you were the only people

07:35.480 --> 07:37.960
in the house

07:38.000 --> 07:39.240
when Mr Doran died.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.640
It was just the four of us. All night.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.520
And, er, no one else arrived and no one else left?

07:44.560 --> 07:46.160
-That's right. -No, it's not.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.960
Dad went for a walk, didn't he?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.640
You're Mr Doran's son, I take it. Drew?

07:51.680 --> 07:54.360
So could you tell us, erm, when this walk was?

07:55.080 --> 07:56.400
It was 3:00 a.m.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.080
Jacob said he needed some air.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.240
Did anyone see where he went?

08:03.240 --> 08:05.480
I was worried, so I went after him,

08:05.520 --> 08:08.200
erm, but he'd gone into the garden and it was dark.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.680
I'm sorry. I don't know where he went,

08:10.720 --> 08:12.920
but he was gone about an hour.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.440
<i>I remember the clock striking</i> <i>4:00 as he got back.</i>

08:19.920 --> 08:22.640
Do any of you know where Mr Doran got the gun from?

08:22.680 --> 08:25.400
No. I mean, Jacob hated guns.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.800
Er, did he perhaps keep a gun in the safe?

08:27.840 --> 08:30.800
The safe just contains family documents and money.

08:30.840 --> 08:35.200
And yet someone's emptied it of money and taken

08:30.840 --> 08:35.200
Mr Doran's passport.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.960
Er, which brings me to this morning.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.840
Where were you all when you heard the gunshot?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.120
I was up here on my own.

08:41.160 --> 08:43.680
And did you see anyone come or go from the study before

08:43.720 --> 08:45.160
or after the gunshot?

08:45.200 --> 08:48.880
No. I didn't see anyone arrive or leave before I got there.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.720
Erm, who was next to arrive?

08:51.760 --> 08:52.960
It was me.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And, er, where were you beforehand?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.760
I was downstairs.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.400
After Jacob went to write his note, I just, erm,

08:59.440 --> 09:00.840
stayed in the living room.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.440
And Drew was with you?

09:02.480 --> 09:03.680
No. He'd gone to bed.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.600
-Yeah.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.160
So to be clear, you were all

09:07.640 --> 09:10.160
in different parts

09:10.200 --> 09:12.640
of the house at the time of death

09:12.680 --> 09:14.760
and not one of you can alibi anyone else?

09:14.800 --> 09:18.200
We don't need to alibi anyone. Mr Doran took his own life.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.480
Yes, of course,

09:20.520 --> 09:24.200
erm, and I can see where you're coming from with that,

09:20.520 --> 09:24.200
but, erm...

09:25.880 --> 09:28.080
We think Mr Doran was murdered.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.680
No.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.720
That can't be.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.360
I'm sorry, but it looks like that may well

09:33.760 --> 09:36.360
be the case.

09:39.120 --> 09:43.440
Yes, erm, and so we're sort of obliged to ask, erm,

09:43.480 --> 09:46.640
the story in this morning's papers

09:43.480 --> 09:46.640
about Mr Doran's affair,

09:46.680 --> 09:48.280
erm, is that...

09:48.880 --> 09:49.880
Is that true?

09:54.440 --> 09:57.040
So there were only four people in the house all night.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.680
But no-one leaves at any times,

09:57.080 --> 09:59.680
except for one hour

09:59.720 --> 10:01.040
when Jacob goes for his walk.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.600
And at the precise moment he's murdered,

10:02.640 --> 10:05.200
not one of them is in sight of anyone else.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.880
Meaning any one of them could be our killer.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.600
But if one of them was the killer...

10:08.640 --> 10:10.080
Then how did they kill the victim

10:10.120 --> 10:12.320
and then get out of the study without anyone noticing?

10:14.200 --> 10:18.280
It goes without saying, but with a

10:14.200 --> 10:18.280
Government Minister dead,

10:18.320 --> 10:21.240
well, if you need my help, you only have to ask.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.800
Chief! You'd better come and see this.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.440
What is it?

10:31.480 --> 10:35.880
Well, we had a good look around the place,

10:31.480 --> 10:35.880
no sign of any break-in,

10:35.920 --> 10:37.640
but Fidel's found some tyre prints.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.240
FIDEL: It's from a motorbike or a moped.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.880
And why is that of interest?

10:40.920 --> 10:42.840
Well, sir, we checked and the family don't own one,

10:42.880 --> 10:46.080
-but also it rained quite heavily last night.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.080
-Up until about 11:00 p.m.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.720
Yes, so if we can see these tracks...

10:47.760 --> 10:50.000
Then the bike must have been driven up here since then.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.960
Meaning there weren't just four people

10:50.040 --> 10:51.960
up here last night.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.280
There was a fifth person.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.080
What are the chances of tracking this bike down?

10:55.120 --> 10:56.720
It isn't going to be easy, you know, Chief.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.160
There are hundreds of bikes on the island

10:58.200 --> 11:00.880
and I reckon about five of them have paperwork.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.880
-Fidel, I'd like casts of these tyre tracks, please.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.880
-Yes, sir.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.760
And Dwayne, get Theo to take you to the Ministry.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.480
-We need Jacob's laptop and personal papers.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.480
-Yes, Chief.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.800
That just leaves you and me, Camille.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.040
What was the name of the woman Jacob had

11:10.840 --> 11:13.040
his affair with?

11:13.080 --> 11:15.360
-Lena Bell. -Lena Bell.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.280
Let's go and find out how she fits into the story.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.320
LENA: I still can't believe it.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.040
Can you tell us,

11:23.080 --> 11:26.000
how did you end up working for the Ministry of Commerce?

11:26.040 --> 11:29.280
I applied for an internship there last year.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.000
I enjoyed it.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.720
It felt important and I liked the work.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.240
So what happened?

11:38.280 --> 11:40.640
There was a trade conference in Mexico.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.440
Mr Doran asked me to go with him,

11:43.080 --> 11:45.240
as his aide.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.000
I got to be in the room where decisions were made,

11:48.040 --> 11:49.720
and I think I did a good job.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.480
He told me I did

11:51.520 --> 11:55.000
when we went for dinner to celebrate that night.

11:55.040 --> 11:58.680
When we got back to the hotel, he ordered champagne

11:55.040 --> 11:58.680
to his room,

11:58.720 --> 12:00.400
said we deserved a nightcap...

12:01.960 --> 12:03.160
So I went with him.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.920
He seduced you.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.600
The next day, I felt so ashamed.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.920
The moment I got back to Saint-Marie, I resigned,

12:10.960 --> 12:12.080
and that was three weeks ago.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.560
Where have you been since yesterday evening?

12:15.600 --> 12:17.840
I haven't left the house, if that's what you mean.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.440
I haven't dared to.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.920
Do you know who told the newspaper about your affair?

12:24.880 --> 12:28.200
-Sometimes money to be made

12:24.880 --> 12:28.200
in stories like these.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.040
It wasn't me.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.320
Is there anyone else who can confirm

12:33.360 --> 12:35.320
that you've not left the house since yesterday?

12:35.360 --> 12:37.080
My godfather's been staying with me.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.760
Marlon!

12:42.800 --> 12:44.480
MARLON: Oh! Here.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.800
Marlon, it's the police.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.840
I'm from St Lucia originally.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.920
When my family heard I was going to be in the papers,

12:50.960 --> 12:52.600
Marlon was on the first flight out here.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.200
Sure was.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.960
I'm Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.960
This is DS Bordey.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.560
Camille?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.200
Marlon

13:10.200 --> 13:11.720
You, er... Do you know each other?

13:12.400 --> 13:13.480
Er...

13:13.520 --> 13:15.400
Not really. It was a long time ago.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.440
Oh. Okay. Well, there we are, then.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.720
So, erm...

13:24.040 --> 13:25.320
Mister...

13:25.840 --> 13:27.840
Croft.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.440
Mr Croft, er... When did you

13:27.880 --> 13:31.440
get to the island?

13:31.480 --> 13:33.720
-Three days ago. -And you've been here

13:31.480 --> 13:33.720
the whole time?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.360
Okay, right, erm, Camille do you have any...

13:38.320 --> 13:40.080
No, Okay, back to me.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.000
So, erm, and since yesterday, you've both been in the house?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.200
We stayed up late last night.

13:46.240 --> 13:51.520
We worried what the papers was going to say but by

13:46.240 --> 13:51.520
2:00 a.m., I said, "Enough."

13:51.560 --> 13:54.120
<i>So I sent Lena to bed, lock up</i> <i>and went to bed myself</i>

13:54.160 --> 13:56.720
<i>in the spare room at the back.</i>

13:57.640 --> 13:58.960
I see.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.560
So, er, just to satisfy my curiosity,

14:03.600 --> 14:05.080
do either of you own a motorbike?

14:07.040 --> 14:10.160
I'm only here a few days, I've hired no vehicle.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.920
Okay, well, that all seems pretty satisfactory.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.520
Er, do you have any...

14:15.560 --> 14:18.080
No, course you don't, otherwise you would

14:15.560 --> 14:18.080
have asked them already.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.000
Okay, thank you for your time.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.880
Right, er... So, er, I'm not one to pry

14:21.040 --> 14:23.880
or anything, and I loathe the word but I couldn't

14:23.920 --> 14:26.760
help but notice a bit of a "vibe" back there.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.080
How do you mean?

14:28.120 --> 14:31.320
Well, you know, between you and Lena's godfather.

14:31.360 --> 14:35.000
Look, if you do have a history with a witness,

14:31.360 --> 14:35.000
I kind of have to know.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.160
I think Marlon back there is my father.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.680
What? Blimey!

14:40.320 --> 14:41.320
Camille?

14:44.200 --> 14:47.160
I was hoping, you know,

14:47.200 --> 14:49.360
if I saw you again, it wouldn't be like this.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.840
You're looking well.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.360
I'm only here for a couple of days, helping Lena,

14:56.400 --> 14:58.120
and then I'm on the first plane out.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.280
I know. You said.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.960
-Chief. -Dwayne.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.840
Ah, sir, I've got the tyre tracks here.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.240
It looks like the bike was a moped.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.760
Excellent. Good work, Fidel.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.520
And I've got the Minister's personal files from his office

15:24.560 --> 15:26.080
-and his laptop. -Jolly good.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.840
Is everything all right, sir?

15:32.800 --> 15:35.680
Yes, well, I don't know.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.440
Lena Bell's got her godfather staying with her

15:39.480 --> 15:40.880
and you'll never guess who it is.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.280
Who is he?

15:42.320 --> 15:43.560
Camille's father.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.040
He's on the island?

15:45.080 --> 15:47.520
Yes, and I rather get the impression they don't get on.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.240
Yes, erm, Camille doesn't really talk about her dad.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.960
You know, he walked out on her and her mother

15:54.360 --> 15:56.960
when she was a kid.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.040
Yes, and I don't think she's seen him since.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.960
Yes, I see. That would explain a lot.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.680
Hello, Camille.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.760
<i>Maman,</i> he's here.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.440
Who is, darling?

16:14.480 --> 16:15.600
Marlon.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.880
Marlon Croft.

16:18.920 --> 16:22.400
Sorry, your father is on the island?

16:23.040 --> 16:24.400
Yes.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.040
He was looking for you?

16:26.080 --> 16:27.760
Don't worry. He's not here for me,

16:27.800 --> 16:30.440
or you, I don't think, it's just bad luck.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.840
Are you okay?

16:36.160 --> 16:38.080
Yes, but I'm fine, honestly.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.760
So what did you talk about?

16:41.800 --> 16:44.560
He just said he was on the island to help

16:41.800 --> 16:44.560
his goddaughter.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.800
Oh.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.840
...and she's the woman Jacob Doran had

16:46.840 --> 16:48.840
an affair with.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.760
Whatever reason that man's on the island,

16:54.800 --> 16:58.120
it won't be to help his goddaughter.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.200
Hmm.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.320
Hmm?

17:02.360 --> 17:04.560
Nice and neat, please, Dwayne. Nice and neat.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.880
-Yes.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.040
The suicide note. It's definitely the

17:06.920 --> 17:10.040
victim's handwriting.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.280
Ah, well, maybe he was forced to write the note.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.200
You know, "Write the note or we shoot you.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.880
"Oh, thanks for the note. Now we shoot you."

17:15.920 --> 17:18.040
I know but that's the thing.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.040
You see, Jacob used a fountain pen, right?

17:21.080 --> 17:22.560
So if he'd been forced to write this,

17:22.600 --> 17:24.880
there'd be spots of ink, there'd be palm smudges.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.960
Look, the letter formation,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.280
it remains consistent throughout.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.760
There's nothing rushed or forced about

17:31.320 --> 17:33.760
this letter at all, sir.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.480
It's the real deal.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.440
-Yes.

17:37.480 --> 17:38.520
Hmm.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.160
Ah, Camille...

17:41.200 --> 17:42.240
You okay?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.360
Of course. Why shouldn't I be?

17:45.400 --> 17:46.760
Ah, no reason. Just thought I'd ask.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.520
So! What have we...

17:51.280 --> 17:52.760
Let's have that there.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.240
No, that's not quite right.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.200
There we go. There.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.200
Ah, perfect.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.160
So...

18:03.200 --> 18:05.640
Jacob Doran, Saint-Marie's Minister of Commerce,

18:05.680 --> 18:07.720
sleeps with one of his interns, Lena Bell.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.120
-Er...

18:09.160 --> 18:10.920
But when I spoke to Theo,

18:10.960 --> 18:13.520
he kind of admitted that Jacob had a string of women

18:10.960 --> 18:13.520
over the years.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.000
-Can we get

18:13.560 --> 18:15.000
back to the...

18:15.040 --> 18:17.480
He also said that Jacob made sure his family

18:15.040 --> 18:17.480
never found out.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.240
In my experience, the wife always knows.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.640
In which case, the wife's got a motive.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.920
Yes, but we're not doing motive yet.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.680
Okay, everything in order.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.120
So, as I was saying. Jacob and Lena

18:25.720 --> 18:29.120
have their affair.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.960
How did the newspaper find out about it?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.280
You know what I think?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.600
Only a few people could have known about the affair

18:34.640 --> 18:38.040
and one of them must have been Marlon.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.560
Huh? You think he sold out his own goddaughter

18:38.080 --> 18:41.560
to the media?

18:41.600 --> 18:43.560
If there was money to be made from it,

18:43.600 --> 18:45.280
it would explain what he's doing on the island.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.520
Do you think we might be able to get

18:46.560 --> 18:48.120
the Commissioner to lean on the paper?

18:48.160 --> 18:49.600
-It's worth a try. -Dwayne...

18:49.640 --> 18:51.080
I'm on it, Chief.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.480
So, once the Minister knows the story's about to break,

18:54.520 --> 18:56.680
he tells his Press Secretary, his wife and his son.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.520
And then they all stay up together all night.

18:58.560 --> 19:02.400
Except for one hour at 3:00 a.m. when Jacob

18:58.560 --> 19:02.400
goes for a walk on his own.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.600
That's right, which is when he may have met the person

19:05.640 --> 19:06.800
who rode up to the house on the bike.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.000
As dawn rises, Jacob goes to his study

19:11.040 --> 19:14.640
and writes a suicide note, which we believe is real,

19:14.680 --> 19:18.160
but before he can kill himself,

19:14.680 --> 19:18.160
his murderer shoots him dead.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.040
With an illegal pistol, sir, that's had its

19:18.200 --> 19:21.040
serial number filed off.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.800
-No, quite right. -And don't forget, sir,

19:22.840 --> 19:25.840
the killer also emptied the safe of cash

19:22.840 --> 19:25.840
and the Minister's passport.

19:25.880 --> 19:26.920
That's right! He did.

19:33.960 --> 19:37.960
-And none of it makes any sense.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.920
No, because if Fidel is right and the suicide note is real,

19:40.960 --> 19:42.920
why does the killer need to kill a man whose

19:42.960 --> 19:44.680
already in the process of killing himself?

19:44.720 --> 19:46.760
DWAYNE: Okay, thank you very much.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.800
The Commissioner's going to see what he can do.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.520
Good. Then I'd like you to find the bike

19:50.560 --> 19:52.400
that was up at the house in the middle of the night.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.840
-There's every chance that the rider is our killer.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.840
-Right, Chief.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.240
And Fidel, if you'd go through Jacob's laptop and files,

19:57.280 --> 19:59.240
-see if you can find anything for us...

19:57.280 --> 19:59.240
-Yes, sir.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.400
...which just leaves you and me, Camille.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.400
Now I think we need to talk to Charlotte again,

20:03.440 --> 20:05.640
because if Jacob was a serial adulterer,

20:05.680 --> 20:08.320
there's every chance that this was the affair that

20:05.680 --> 20:08.320
pushed her over the edge.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.680
Gosh.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.040
What a lovely dress.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.840
It was such a happy day...

20:15.880 --> 20:17.880
Yes, it looks like it.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.440
Erm,

20:19.480 --> 20:20.720
how long were you married?

20:21.400 --> 20:22.680
Thirty-one years.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.760
Wow.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.120
-No.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.640
Yes, I am.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.560
Well, I mean... Sorry, I'm not,

20:29.600 --> 20:30.960
although actually, of course, I am.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.720
It's complicated.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.480
Do you remember your wedding day?

20:36.520 --> 20:38.080
Oh, God, no way I'd forget it.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.040
I had shooting pains down my right arm,

20:38.120 --> 20:40.040
the stress of being in

20:40.080 --> 20:43.320
the centre of attention like that, the cake,

20:40.080 --> 20:43.320
then walking up the aisle,

20:43.360 --> 20:45.000
er...

20:45.040 --> 20:49.200
While also being profound, of course,

20:45.040 --> 20:49.200
and extremely moving.

20:51.880 --> 20:55.000
I thought I didn't have to worry about

20:51.880 --> 20:55.000
anything ever again.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.800
We were husband and wife, for richer, for poorer,

20:58.840 --> 21:03.240
in sickness and in health, until death do us part.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.800
Mrs Doran, as far as you know, was this your husband's

21:03.280 --> 21:06.800
first affair?

21:14.160 --> 21:18.000
The first time was awful,

21:18.040 --> 21:20.960
but I'd just had Drew and I had to make a decision,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.560
to leave Jacob, the father of my child

21:24.960 --> 21:26.920
or turn a blind eye to his infidelity.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.640
And you're okay with that?

21:29.680 --> 21:32.200
When you're married to a successful man like Jacob,

21:32.240 --> 21:34.160
you have to make allowances.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.680
Mmm.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.640
So why didn't you tell us this before?

21:38.680 --> 21:41.280
Because Drew doesn't know about the other affairs,

21:43.200 --> 21:47.040
and I don't want him to find out.

21:43.200 --> 21:47.040
He idolised his father.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.520
We'll be as discreet as we can.

21:49.560 --> 21:54.240
Then all I ask is that you catch my husband's killer

21:54.280 --> 21:57.720
'cause I want to see who did this behind bars

21:54.280 --> 21:57.720
for a very long time.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.880
Erm, thank you.

22:31.680 --> 22:35.200
So what do you think

22:35.240 --> 22:38.080
I don't know. I think she loved Jacob.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.880
And if she's always known about the affairs...

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
And if Theo's always known about the affairs...

22:43.960 --> 22:47.920
Then the news would have only been a surprise to Drew

22:43.960 --> 22:47.920
that night.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.440
But, then, if you caught your dad having an affair,

22:49.480 --> 22:51.960
you wouldn't kill him, would you?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.640
Depends on what kind of relationship you had

22:52.000 --> 22:54.640
with your father.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.200
Ah, yes, yes.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.480
Erm...

23:00.000 --> 23:01.880
So, if you don't mind me asking, that is,

23:01.920 --> 23:05.840
-if it's not too personal, which it is, frankly...

23:01.920 --> 23:05.840
-Look.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.560
There's nothing to tell, okay?

23:16.680 --> 23:20.520
My mother and Marlon only were together a few years.

23:20.560 --> 23:24.320
They had me. Marlon never came to terms with being a father.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.560
Anyway, when I was six years old,

23:27.040 --> 23:30.560
he walked out on both of us,

23:30.600 --> 23:34.800
moved to St Lucia and, er, I've never seen him since.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.840
Right. That's tough. Thank you.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.320
I've always had my mother.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Right.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.880
So, just to calibrate, you don't think

23:44.520 --> 23:47.880
Marlon's the murderer?

23:49.760 --> 23:52.840
I can't answer that. I don't know him.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.760
So you haven't sold a moped in the last few weeks?

24:04.800 --> 24:09.120
Okay, if you hear any different any time soon,

24:04.800 --> 24:09.120
let me know, you see.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.760
Oh.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.760
You trying to ruin my figure, Chief?

24:17.800 --> 24:19.640
Okay, so the pathologist's report is in.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.720
Jacob was killed by a single shot to the heart

24:21.760 --> 24:23.520
fired at point-blank range.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.480
The bullet was a .38 calibre, fired by the gun

24:23.560 --> 24:26.480
we found at the scene,

24:26.520 --> 24:28.680
only the victim's fingerprints were found on it.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.640
Suggesting it was suicide.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.400
Yes, but the swabs Fidel took from Jacob's hands

24:33.440 --> 24:36.600
showed no traces of gunshot residue

24:33.440 --> 24:36.600
on them anywhere.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.400
So, Jacob didn't fire the gun.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.760
Yes, but he was shot.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.880
So the killer must have put the gun in Jacob's hand

24:41.920 --> 24:45.000
to make it look like suicide, and that is a biscuit to me.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.960
So, Camille, what have you got...

24:51.000 --> 24:52.120
Sorry. So sorry.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.800
What... What do you have there?

24:54.840 --> 24:57.480
-The witnesses' phone records have come in.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.480
-Mmm.

24:57.520 --> 24:58.960
-Yes.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.360
I'll...

25:00.400 --> 25:02.840
I went through Jacob's files last night, but as I fired

25:02.880 --> 25:06.160
up his computer, I discovered that someone had removed

25:02.880 --> 25:06.160
the hard drive.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.160
Now, according to Jacob's secretary,

25:08.200 --> 25:10.680
the only person who could remove that drive

25:08.200 --> 25:10.680
is Jacob himself.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.320
-Yes.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.720
Jacob kept his laptop under lock and key

25:12.360 --> 25:14.720
when he wasn't there,

25:14.760 --> 25:16.080
but don't worry,

25:16.120 --> 25:18.120
I got the IT department to put this together for me.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.240
And what's on that?

25:19.280 --> 25:20.520
A copy of every document

25:20.560 --> 25:22.760
the Ministry's created in the past four years.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.800
A copy of all the files on Jacob's laptop are

25:22.800 --> 25:25.800
on here... Somewhere.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.800
But that means Jacob was destroying evidence

25:29.840 --> 25:30.960
the day before he was killed.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.360
Why? So we have a wife,

25:34.280 --> 25:35.880
a son,

25:35.920 --> 25:39.160
the young lover, the young lover's godfather,

25:35.920 --> 25:39.160
a press secretary,

25:39.200 --> 25:41.840
and a victim who was in the process of killing himself.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.560
Who is the killer?

25:43.600 --> 25:46.240
Sir, I think I may know.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.640
-It's Lena's phone records.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.840
Look, she's been dialling the same number two

25:48.680 --> 25:52.840
or three times a day.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.600
Easy, it's got to be Jacob.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.920
It'll be during the, er, "sexy texts" stage

25:58.960 --> 26:00.800
of their relationship, you know.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.760
Er, no, it's not Jacob, but you're close.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.280
Drew, what is this?

26:11.680 --> 26:14.200
In that case, erm, could you hand over

26:11.680 --> 26:14.200
your phone, please,

26:14.240 --> 26:17.560
because I'm pretty sure it still has plenty of texts

26:14.240 --> 26:17.560
from Lena on it?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.080
-Your phone, please. -You don't need my phone.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.040
You're right.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.240
Me and Lena met in a bar last year,

26:21.080 --> 26:24.240
hit it off, you know,

26:24.280 --> 26:26.600
-started seeing each other. -You didn't tell me.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.520
Yes, because I don't tell you everything.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.880
I'm not a child any more.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.200
She wanted a career in politics, I knew I could help.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.680
How?

26:34.720 --> 26:37.600
I told her to apply for an internship in

26:34.720 --> 26:37.600
Dad's department.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.280
Did your father know she was your girlfriend?

26:40.520 --> 26:42.120
Didn't even know we knew each other.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.720
When did you discover he'd slept with her?

26:45.120 --> 26:47.800
When she got back from Mexico. She told me.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.320
And how did that make you feel?

26:50.360 --> 26:53.000
-I was sick. I couldn't believe it.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.000
-CAMILLE: And then...

26:53.040 --> 26:54.400
Well, I was angry.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.840
With Lena?

26:55.880 --> 26:58.920
Yes, but it wasn't her fault, not the way she told it.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.400
It was Dad, he seduced my girlfriend.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.680
Why do you think Lena didn't tell us any of this?

27:03.720 --> 27:05.600
She was probably trying to protect me.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.960
And why didn't you tell us?

27:07.000 --> 27:10.040
Because I had nothing to do with my dad's suicide.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.800
You still think your father killed himself?

27:12.840 --> 27:14.960
Have you found a single piece of evidence

27:15.000 --> 27:17.160
that categorically proves he didn't?

27:20.640 --> 27:22.120
I knew it.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.440
Jay! Jay! Vinny.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.280
Is that your bike?

27:42.440 --> 27:43.720
Hold it.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.520
Lovely.

27:53.560 --> 27:57.400
-So, Drew has known about Lena for weeks.

27:53.560 --> 27:57.400
-Yes.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.120
So he could have been planning the murder

27:59.160 --> 28:01.160
ever since he found out about Mexico.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.520
Yes, but how would he know

28:02.560 --> 28:04.520
that Jacob was going to commit suicide that night?

28:04.560 --> 28:05.960
No, good point.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.520
And why even bother going through with killing a man

28:08.560 --> 28:10.200
when he was going to kill himself anyway?

28:11.520 --> 28:12.760
Good morning, team.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.360
How's the case going?

28:15.400 --> 28:17.800
Well, sir, it's all good in some respects

28:17.840 --> 28:21.000
and then, in other respects, it is less good.

28:21.040 --> 28:24.360
-It is pretty heavily weighted

28:21.040 --> 28:24.360
on the "less good" side

28:24.400 --> 28:26.320
of the seesaw, sir, but it's only days in.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.800
Did you get anywhere with the newspaper, sir?

28:28.840 --> 28:30.520
I spoke to the paper's editor

28:30.560 --> 28:32.920
who point blank refused to reveal his source.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.320
The only thing he would tell me

28:34.360 --> 28:37.080
was that the story came from someone "Close to Jacob".

28:37.120 --> 28:40.000
Okay, but, erm, if they're close to Jacob,

28:37.120 --> 28:40.000
then it...

28:40.040 --> 28:41.040
It could be Charlotte

28:41.760 --> 28:44.000
or Drew or Theo,

28:44.760 --> 28:46.160
or Lena, even.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.320
Yes, you're right, they're all pretty close to Jacob.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.160
In fact, the only one it couldn't be is Marlon.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.320
Fidel!

28:53.160 --> 28:54.760
Oh.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.520
Commissioner.

28:58.680 --> 28:59.720
Any progress?

28:59.760 --> 29:01.680
A little, but it can wait, though.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.760
Not at all, we're all ears.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.240
But it's just that I'd rather not...

29:05.280 --> 29:07.840
No, tell us who is our mystery man on the bike

29:07.880 --> 29:10.160
and soon-to-be prime suspect in the murder.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.400
It's my father, isn't it?

29:12.240 --> 29:14.480
Er...

29:14.520 --> 29:18.320
I'm sorry, Camille. Marlon borrowed a bike

29:14.520 --> 29:18.320
the day before the murder.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.800
He then returned the bike to the owner

29:18.360 --> 29:20.800
yesterday afternoon.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.320
I've checked the bike's tyres

29:22.360 --> 29:24.720
against the casts Fidel took from the scene.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.440
It was your father who was up at the victim's house

29:26.480 --> 29:27.600
on the night of the murder.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.720
So we'd better find out why he's been lying to us. Sir.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.160
-There was something else.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.040
When I was asking around, I heard a rumour that

29:40.200 --> 29:43.040
maybe Jacob was a little

29:43.080 --> 29:46.360
bit too close to a local businessman, a guy

29:43.080 --> 29:46.360
called Desmond Colbert.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.080
-He owns a rum distillery.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.120
It's been rumoured that he's got

29:49.120 --> 29:51.120
links to the underworld,

29:51.160 --> 29:53.400
-but nothing's ever been proven.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.720
Ah, right. Erm, sorry, but if I don't go now,

29:53.440 --> 29:56.720
she'll go without me.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.920
You know what she's like, sir... Fiery!

29:58.960 --> 30:00.200
Go, Inspector.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.080
Look, it's not like you think.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.720
Then how is it?

30:18.760 --> 30:21.840
Mr Croft, we can prove that the bike you had

30:18.760 --> 30:21.840
access to was

30:21.880 --> 30:23.640
up at Jacob's the night he got killed.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.880
So you've got two options. One, tell us the truth.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.840
Or two, we can arrest you on suspicion of murder.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.000
She's got a point.

30:30.040 --> 30:33.280
Man, all right, I admit it.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.640
I was at the dead guy's house.

30:35.680 --> 30:39.120
But I was gone long before any shooting started.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.640
Why should we believe any word you say?

30:43.920 --> 30:45.320
All right, I'll tell you.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.480
So I sent Lena to bed,

30:47.520 --> 30:49.320
like I told you, at 2:00 a.m.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.480
<i>But you're right.</i>

30:50.520 --> 30:52.240
<i>I lined up the bike first.</i>

30:52.280 --> 30:54.120
<i>Not sure if I was</i> <i>going to use it.</i>

30:54.160 --> 30:56.880
<i>But the more</i> <i>I thought about it,</i>

30:54.160 --> 30:56.880
<i>the more I reckoned,</i>

30:56.920 --> 30:58.960
<i>this is Jacob's fault.</i>

30:59.000 --> 31:01.120
<i>I wanted to put</i> <i>the squeeze on him.</i>

31:01.160 --> 31:02.400
Sort out some compensation

31:02.440 --> 31:04.400
for Lena.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.840
You mean, demand money with menaces?

31:06.880 --> 31:09.280
Remind him of his obligations.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.560
You went up there in the middle of the night?

31:11.600 --> 31:13.200
It was for Lena. It mattered.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.080
What time d'you get there?

31:16.120 --> 31:17.640
A bit before 4:00 a.m.,

31:19.520 --> 31:20.640
Jacob was already up.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.480
<i>He was in the garden.</i>

31:22.520 --> 31:24.080


31:22.520 --> 31:24.080
<i>-No. He was on his own.</i> <i>Looked like he'd come</i>

31:24.120 --> 31:25.680
<i>back from the beach.</i>

31:25.720 --> 31:29.520
<i>So I told him he owed Lena</i> <i>for what he'd done to her.</i>

31:29.560 --> 31:31.280
<i>To be honest,</i>

31:31.320 --> 31:34.360
<i>I got the feeling he'd agree</i> <i>to anything just to</i>

31:31.320 --> 31:34.360
<i>get rid of me.</i>

31:34.400 --> 31:36.720
So he took me inside the house.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.680
Did anyone else see you while you were inside?

31:40.840 --> 31:42.040
One moment, Lena. What happened next?

31:43.320 --> 31:45.160
MARLON: <i> I waited</i> <i>outside the study.</i>

31:45.200 --> 31:46.880
<i>He went in and came out</i> <i>with a cheque.</i>

31:46.920 --> 31:49.360


31:46.920 --> 31:49.360
<i>-It was a cheque.</i>

31:49.400 --> 31:50.720
Was there anyone else in the study with him?

31:50.760 --> 31:52.400
I couldn't see.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.840
Once I got the money, I was on the bike and I

31:52.440 --> 31:54.840
was out of there again.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.080
I don't understand. You were at Jacob's house?

31:57.120 --> 32:00.360
Sure. Marlon here was getting you some money.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.360
Now hold on! I was waiting for

32:02.400 --> 32:05.360
the right moment...

32:13.400 --> 32:15.400
Your mum wants you home,

32:15.440 --> 32:18.720
so I got Jacob to give me some money to

32:15.440 --> 32:18.720
cover your flights.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.760
-7:00 a.m.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.560
So, you should know.

32:25.600 --> 32:29.480
At 7:00 a.m., I was at the airport,

32:25.600 --> 32:29.480
it's when the desk opened,

32:29.520 --> 32:34.720
buying my goddaughter a return flight ticket to St Lucia.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.520
CAMILLE: Okay, well, thank you very much for that.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.680
Marlon was definitely at the airport buying a

32:40.720 --> 32:43.200
plane ticket at the exact same time Jacob was being

32:43.240 --> 32:45.040
murdered on the other side of the island.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.360
And the bank say that he paid the cheque into his account

32:47.400 --> 32:48.920
at 9:06 a.m. that morning.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.200
And Jacob had thousands of dollars in

32:48.960 --> 32:51.200
his safe, so we're told,

32:51.240 --> 32:53.520
so why did he write Marlon a cheque?

32:53.560 --> 32:56.720
Why not just pay Marlon with the cash in the safe?

32:56.760 --> 32:58.840
It's bizarre, it's...

32:58.880 --> 33:02.640
Cheque, cash, cash, cheque...

33:02.680 --> 33:04.200
Okay.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.400
We can strike Marlon from the investigation,

33:06.440 --> 33:11.000
he is not our murderer.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.880
Fidel, d'you get anywhere with the data from

33:11.040 --> 33:14.880
the Ministry's hard drive?

33:14.920 --> 33:17.960
Well, sir, I've isolated as many

33:14.920 --> 33:17.960
of the documents connecting

33:18.000 --> 33:19.800
Jacob to the rum trade as I could find.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.160
Bills of lading or export licences and so on.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.080
There's about 500 that I've printed out already.

33:24.120 --> 33:27.520
Yeah,

33:24.120 --> 33:27.520
but don't worry, sir.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.120
Juliet's cooking up a fearsome roti and kalalu tonight.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.320
The plan is for Dwayne and me to split this in two

33:32.360 --> 33:34.800
-and go through it all together.

33:34.840 --> 33:37.360
No! That is what I told him, Chief.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.920
He'll be working through the files

33:38.960 --> 33:41.200
and I'll be working through the roti, the kalalu and beer.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.600
Yeah, probably.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.640
Ha, right, er, well, it's, er... It's getting late.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.880
Let's, erm, knock off tonight and pick this up

33:44.680 --> 33:46.880
again tomorrow.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.240
And, erm, Camille.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.840
Mmm-hmm.

33:55.880 --> 33:58.920
You, erm... Fancy a drink maybe?

33:58.960 --> 34:00.080
Bite to eat?

34:00.120 --> 34:01.280
No.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.200
Or if it's, er...

34:03.240 --> 34:05.160
It's fun you're after, there's always, um,

34:05.200 --> 34:06.760
<i>Travel Battleships.</i>

34:06.800 --> 34:07.960
I beg your pardon?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
<i>Guerre Bateaux,</i> as you probably call it.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.680
Oh!

34:11.720 --> 34:13.440
Although, I... I lost a submarine a couple

34:11.720 --> 34:13.440
of weeks ago, erm...

34:13.480 --> 34:14.840
It shouldn't matter so much.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.560
It's, er, essentially just a pen and paper game,

34:16.600 --> 34:18.160
we could draw up a couple of grids and...

34:18.200 --> 34:20.440
No, no, no, no. Thank you. I... I'll go home.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.960
Camille?

34:47.080 --> 34:48.840
What are you doing on the island?

34:48.880 --> 34:52.000
I told you. I'm here to help Lena.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.400
I don't believe you.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.920
Why don't you believe me?

34:54.960 --> 34:56.240
Because I know what you're like.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.800
You've not seen me for 25 years

34:59.840 --> 35:01.560
and you know exactly what I'm like?

35:03.840 --> 35:05.440
I've heard the stories.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.800
From your mother, you mean?

35:06.840 --> 35:08.400
Yes.

35:08.440 --> 35:13.280
Camille, I think about you every day.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.000
I've even written you letters.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.400
I haven't posted them but they're written.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.440
Then why haven't you sent them?

35:25.000 --> 35:27.640
I don't know what your mother told you.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.880
But you should know the truth.

35:29.920 --> 35:34.560
My being out of your life, I was only doing

35:29.920 --> 35:34.560
as I was asked.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.000
-What she asked of me.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.800
How's the new organised regime going?

35:52.840 --> 35:54.680
Oh, it's made all the difference, Catherine.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.240
A place for everything, and, er,

35:54.720 --> 35:58.240
everything in its

35:58.280 --> 35:59.680
place.

35:59.720 --> 36:03.040
I just need to learn where those new places are. Ah!

36:03.080 --> 36:05.080
-No.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.080
Camille?

36:07.120 --> 36:08.280
I need to ask you something.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.080
What

36:11.120 --> 36:12.880
Because I don't want to take his side.

36:12.920 --> 36:17.160
Whose side

36:17.200 --> 36:20.640
Marlon told me he didn't leave us when

36:17.200 --> 36:20.640
we were in St Lucia.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.960
You walked out on him, and that's why

36:23.000 --> 36:24.520
the two of us moved back here.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.760
It's a lie, isn't it?

36:26.800 --> 36:28.240
He's lying?

36:29.680 --> 36:31.040
Well, I... I...

36:32.080 --> 36:33.640
You walked out on him?

36:33.680 --> 36:36.280
It was you that walked out on him?

36:37.400 --> 36:39.160
Camille, I can explain...

36:39.200 --> 36:42.040
It's yes or no, <i> Maman.</i> Did you walk out on my father?

36:46.840 --> 36:48.080
Camille...

36:49.880 --> 36:51.200
Camille?

36:53.320 --> 36:54.520
Keep the change.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.760
-Camille, just hold on a moment!

37:03.680 --> 37:05.680
I just wanted to know if you were okay?

37:05.720 --> 37:08.560
She has lied to me my entire life.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.600
Ah, yes, I gathered as much, but, erm,

37:08.600 --> 37:11.600
maybe you should go back...

37:11.640 --> 37:13.600
I don't want to hear what she has to say.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.440
Okay.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.640
We could go for that drink, in another bar of course.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.680
I mean, if you want to talk about it. Or not?

37:19.720 --> 37:21.560
That also works.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.960
Good night, Humphrey.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.640
Ah! Morning, Camille!

37:43.680 --> 37:45.240
Morning, sir.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.440
Are you, er... Are you okay?

37:53.480 --> 37:55.160
Of course I'm okay.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.960
Okay!

37:58.000 --> 38:00.840
Listen, just make sure you call us as soon as

37:58.000 --> 38:00.840
the boat has docked, okay?

38:00.880 --> 38:02.080
All right.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.240
Er, what's going on?

38:03.280 --> 38:05.200
Well, Chief, it took us most of the night,

38:05.240 --> 38:07.480
but the answers were in the files, just like you said.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.920
What have you found?

38:08.960 --> 38:10.640
First, we didn't see anything because there's nothing

38:10.680 --> 38:13.280
illegal about the outward shipments of rum

38:10.680 --> 38:13.280
from the island,

38:13.320 --> 38:15.680
but it's what gets imported back into Saint-Marie

38:13.320 --> 38:15.680
that's interesting.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.480
-Yes,

38:17.520 --> 38:19.360
because every time a boat comes to the island

38:17.520 --> 38:19.360
it's full of cotton

38:19.400 --> 38:22.400
or timber or whatever's being imported from

38:19.400 --> 38:22.400
wherever it's been to.

38:22.440 --> 38:25.280
But every time a boat comes from South Africa,

38:22.440 --> 38:25.280
there are always

38:25.320 --> 38:28.200
four crates for delivery to a company called

38:25.320 --> 38:28.200
Burwick Trading.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.480
Who are Burwick Trading?

38:29.520 --> 38:32.720
They're a local company with no apparent income,

38:32.760 --> 38:36.000
no head office, no staff, but they do have one owner.

38:36.040 --> 38:37.560
Who is it?

38:37.600 --> 38:40.680
Jacob Doran, our recently-deceased

38:37.600 --> 38:40.680
Minister for Commerce.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.960
It looks like he's been illegally importing goods

38:40.720 --> 38:42.960
from South Africa.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.440
Fantastic. Great work, guys. What's he importing?

38:45.480 --> 38:47.120
We don't know, sir,

38:47.160 --> 38:49.120
but the next delivery to Burwick Trading

38:47.160 --> 38:49.120
arrives in port today.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.600
And when we impound it, we'll finally find out

38:49.160 --> 38:51.600
what this case

38:51.640 --> 38:53.040
is really all about.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.560
Yes, and why the killer wanted to kill someone who was

38:54.600 --> 38:56.400
-already in the process of killing himself.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.400
-Yes.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.400
Ah, er, Camille...

39:09.800 --> 39:12.200
I'm just asking for a chance to explain.

39:16.680 --> 39:20.800
When you were three, Marlon got a job in St Lucia.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.520
We went with him. And we were happy.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.600
After a while it was the same old Marlon,

39:27.640 --> 39:30.840
came and went as he pleased. He couldn't hold down a job.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.960
I put up with his ways for so long.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.280
Then, one morning, he took you to the beach.

39:41.280 --> 39:44.280
By nightfall, he still hadn't come back.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.760
I was going frantic.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.920
Eventually I found you on your own.

39:52.800 --> 39:56.760
Marlon was in a bar nearby, playing cards.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.280
He had forgotten he had you with him.

40:03.240 --> 40:07.480
It was the day I realised he couldn't be a father to you.

40:09.520 --> 40:13.040
So I brought you back home.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.280
To Saint-Marie.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.400
It was what I thought was best for you.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.080
We need to go to the port.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.760
Okay, so the boat is here but the crates for Jacob's

40:48.800 --> 40:50.680
company are not getting unloaded,

40:48.800 --> 40:50.680
they're staying on board.

40:50.720 --> 40:51.800
-I don't know

40:51.840 --> 40:53.920
but the next port of call is Mexico.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.840
Which is where Lena went with Jacob.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.280
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

40:57.320 --> 40:59.560
Forget about Lena, it's not about her.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.720
How do you know?

41:00.760 --> 41:02.160
Because look who's about to get on board.

41:15.400 --> 41:16.600
CAMILLE: <i> Arrêtez !</i>

41:16.640 --> 41:18.120
Good morning, Mr Frazier!

41:18.160 --> 41:19.280
What are you doing here?

41:19.320 --> 41:21.080
I think we could ask you the same question.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.880
Police, we're boarding your boat!

41:34.360 --> 41:36.480
Honestly, I have no idea what is down there.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.160
Dwayne. Dwayne.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.840
Oh!

42:00.680 --> 42:03.040
<i>-Ti mal.</i> -I know this looks bad.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.760
You have no idea.

42:04.800 --> 42:08.280
Well, I reckon we know where Jacob got his handgun

42:04.800 --> 42:08.280
from now, eh?

42:08.320 --> 42:09.360
-Yes, aye. -Yes, aye.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.440
Yes... I'd say that was excellent.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.080
For a long time, I've suspected Jacob

42:14.240 --> 42:17.080
was using his

42:17.120 --> 42:21.120
position in the Ministry to carve out

42:17.120 --> 42:21.120
some kind of sideline.

42:21.160 --> 42:25.000
A few months back, I discovered Burwick Trading

42:21.160 --> 42:25.000
was owned by him.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.320
He was up to something illegal,

42:27.000 --> 42:28.160
but I couldn't prove it.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.680
So you decided to deal with him another way.

42:30.720 --> 42:34.680
At the very least, Jacob had to be

42:30.720 --> 42:34.680
removed from power,

42:34.720 --> 42:36.920
so when I discovered he had another one

42:34.720 --> 42:36.920
of his affairs...

42:36.960 --> 42:39.760
So you were the person close to Jacob

42:36.960 --> 42:39.760
who went to the newspaper? I promise you, if I'd known

42:39.800 --> 42:42.600
he was gun-running,

42:42.640 --> 42:44.920
I would have come straight to you.

42:44.960 --> 42:48.080
So when I came down here, I was trying to get

42:44.960 --> 42:48.080
the boat impounded.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.520
It's true, sir.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.360
The harbour master says Mr Frazier's been trying

42:49.560 --> 42:51.360
to get him

42:51.400 --> 42:54.120
to call the police, he suspected this boat

42:51.400 --> 42:54.120
contained contraband.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.640
Right, everyone, what does this mean?

42:58.680 --> 43:00.840
It means Jacob Doran was a criminal.

43:00.880 --> 43:03.960
Yes, the kind of criminal you want to kill.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.480
Who knew about the gun

43:05.520 --> 43:07.840
And do we believe Theo when he said he didn't?

43:09.600 --> 43:13.720
I don't know but if Theo really didn't

43:09.600 --> 43:13.720
know about it,

43:13.760 --> 43:14.920
then maybe nobody did.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.560
Yes, well, we're so close, we have to be!

43:17.280 --> 43:18.680
Why was he killed?

43:20.600 --> 43:21.880
Camille...

43:21.920 --> 43:23.280
What?

43:24.400 --> 43:26.120
Erm, can I just say something?

43:30.840 --> 43:33.480
Look, I know it's none of my business, so you're

43:33.520 --> 43:35.840
welcome to tell me to shut up, or butt out,

43:35.880 --> 43:37.720
although God knows what "Butt out" actually means...

43:37.760 --> 43:42.480
Anyway, erm, the point is, I have no idea what

43:42.520 --> 43:45.440
your mum said to you, or what she's like, really.

43:45.480 --> 43:48.360
I've only been on the island a short while, but, erm, I do

43:48.400 --> 43:52.160
know what you're like, I think, a bit,

43:48.400 --> 43:52.160
and I just want to say

43:52.200 --> 43:55.040
that you couldn't have been more welcoming to me.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.880
You're kind, you're warm-hearted, funny,

43:57.920 --> 44:00.400
forgiving, and God knows you have to be forgiving

43:57.920 --> 44:00.400
to work with me.

44:00.440 --> 44:02.200
Erm... But the, er...

44:02.240 --> 44:05.840
The thing is, is that whatever problems you

44:05.880 --> 44:09.600
have with Catherine, don't accuse her of being

44:05.880 --> 44:09.600
a bad mother because

44:09.640 --> 44:14.040
from where I'm standing, I'd say she's done

44:09.640 --> 44:14.040
a pretty fantastic job.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.600
Hold on. Sir?

44:23.640 --> 44:25.720
-Yes. -If Jacob was a crook,

44:25.760 --> 44:27.400
then that changes everything, doesn't it?

44:27.440 --> 44:29.040
Yes, it certainly does.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.960
So who killed him, then?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.480
Well, let's start with what we know.

44:33.520 --> 44:36.520
For example, I think we now know why

44:33.520 --> 44:36.520
he had an illegal gun to hand.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.040
It belonged to Jacob.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.040
Which means his murder was never really about

44:39.080 --> 44:41.040
the affair, was it?

44:41.080 --> 44:43.880
It was about gun-running, plain and simple.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.200
Which might also explain why he was killed, even though

44:46.240 --> 44:47.760
he was going to kill himself anyway.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.560
Do you think it was an execution?

44:49.600 --> 44:51.120
Well, maybe it was a message, you know.

44:51.160 --> 44:53.320
You step out of line, you're going to get killed.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.160
Yes, which also explains why he didn't want us

44:55.200 --> 44:56.840
looking at the hard drive.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.560
The only person who could remove that drive

44:56.880 --> 44:58.560
is Jacob himself.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.320
It contained evidence of his arms dealings.

45:00.360 --> 45:03.400
-And why the bullet went through the clothes.

45:00.360 --> 45:03.400
-It was murder.

45:03.440 --> 45:05.200
And why there were tyre tracks.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.040
Because Marlon was up there that night.

45:07.080 --> 45:09.480
So we are left with the suicide note,

45:07.080 --> 45:09.480
Jacob's night-time walk

45:09.520 --> 45:11.640
and the theft of the cash and passport from the safe.

45:11.680 --> 45:12.800
Oh, but the cash is easy.

45:12.840 --> 45:14.560
<i>If you see the cash,</i> <i>you take it.</i>

45:14.600 --> 45:16.200
But why also take the victim's passport?

45:16.240 --> 45:18.440
All I can think is that you want to impersonate him.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.200
But everyone knows what Jacob looks like,

45:20.240 --> 45:21.720
you'd never get away with it.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.440
The only person who could possibly use

45:21.760 --> 45:23.440
that passport is Jacob.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.680
And he can't use it because he is dead.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.240
Wait a minute...

45:30.280 --> 45:31.320
Or could he?

45:32.880 --> 45:35.400
Sir?

45:35.440 --> 45:39.040
But we know he was going to commit suicide,

45:35.440 --> 45:39.040
so what does that mean?

45:39.080 --> 45:42.480
That goes there. Ah, and there...

45:42.520 --> 45:43.800
That's impossible.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.200
That goes there.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.920
Passport... Aha!

45:48.960 --> 45:53.240
So that explains why he wiped his hard drive

45:48.960 --> 45:53.240
and the illegal gun, yes!

45:53.280 --> 45:54.760
And the bullet through the clothes,

45:54.800 --> 45:57.560
and the tyre tracks, but not the 3:00 a.m. walk.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.760
No, of course, the 3:00 a.m. walk.

46:03.800 --> 46:06.720
And that finally explains why!

46:08.960 --> 46:11.080
You know, don't you?

46:11.120 --> 46:13.600
You've got ink on your shirt.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.440
And you've made a serious mess of that board.

46:15.480 --> 46:17.960
FIDEL: I think it suits you, Chief.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.280
No, you're right. You are bloody well right.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.440
That's better.

46:35.480 --> 46:38.920
Right, I think we've got a killer to catch...

46:38.960 --> 46:40.640
Just as soon as I've changed my shirt.

46:54.680 --> 46:56.560
So how do you want to play this?

46:56.600 --> 46:59.040
By, erm, going to the beach.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.280
There's something we've got to find.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.320
Come on.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.720
I think it was better when he was trying

47:11.000 --> 47:13.720
to be neat and tidy.

47:13.760 --> 47:17.000
FIDEL: No, Dwayne. There's a method

47:13.760 --> 47:17.000
in his madness.

47:17.040 --> 47:18.360
There's got to be.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.240
Mind you, I'm not saying he's not mad, okay?

47:24.280 --> 47:26.200
I'm just saying there's a method to it, that's all.

47:26.840 --> 47:28.120
Look mad to me.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.480
He says he doesn't need any help.

47:39.520 --> 47:42.640
Oh, he needs help, all right. Medical help.

47:43.600 --> 47:44.840
Ah!

47:53.520 --> 47:55.600
And he wouldn't tell you what he was looking for?

47:55.640 --> 47:57.680
He just said he wanted it to be a surprise.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.120
No way?

48:02.160 --> 48:03.480
Found it!

48:06.600 --> 48:08.760
-Hold on.

48:10.160 --> 48:13.440
One moment and you'll be able to see.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.480
Yeah, we saw that.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.120
How the hell did you know that was there?

48:17.160 --> 48:19.320
Come on, you all knew there'd be a bag

48:17.160 --> 48:19.320
buried on the beach,

48:19.360 --> 48:21.440
-you must have done... -Sure!

48:21.480 --> 48:22.760
Go on, Officer. Open it. No, no, no, no, You do it.

48:24.120 --> 48:26.800
Oh, I don't need to. I already know what's in it.

48:28.520 --> 48:29.960
-Open it up! -Hold on!

48:33.520 --> 48:34.920
Method to the madness!

48:40.640 --> 48:43.000
Thank you all for joining us.

48:43.040 --> 48:44.440
You've found out who killed Dad?

48:44.480 --> 48:45.680
We have.

48:49.440 --> 48:52.200
Marlon, we know you came here that night,

48:55.920 --> 48:57.840
but by the time Jacob was killed,

48:57.880 --> 49:01.120
you were on the other side of the island buying

48:57.880 --> 49:01.120
your plane tickets.

49:01.160 --> 49:03.360
Which also puts you in the clear, Lena.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.920
After all, there was only one set of tyre tracks

49:03.400 --> 49:05.920
up to the house

49:05.960 --> 49:08.720
that night, and they belonged to Marlon.

49:08.760 --> 49:09.920
So you didn't kill him either.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.360
And then there were three.

49:16.160 --> 49:18.800
You see, the key to this case has always been

49:18.840 --> 49:20.560
the riddle at the heart of it.

49:22.040 --> 49:24.360
Why did the killer kill a man who was

49:24.400 --> 49:26.120
already in the process of killing himself?

49:26.160 --> 49:29.160
It's... It's bizarre.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.520
But as in a lot of riddles, the answer, in the end,

49:32.560 --> 49:34.160
was quite simple.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.560
He wasn't killing himself.

49:37.800 --> 49:40.800
Well, he was. We saw the letter.

49:40.840 --> 49:42.280
Fidel?

49:42.320 --> 49:45.360
The suicide note was real enough.

49:42.320 --> 49:45.360
But it was also fake.

49:45.400 --> 49:46.840
That's not possible.

49:46.880 --> 49:48.760
Oh, it's possible, it's just a

49:46.880 --> 49:48.760
little paradoxical...

49:52.800 --> 49:54.800
But then, in the end, no more puzzling

49:52.800 --> 49:54.800
than the other

49:54.840 --> 49:56.760
paradoxes in this case.

49:56.800 --> 50:00.520
For example, why was it Jacob's press secretary

49:56.800 --> 50:00.520
who gave

50:00.560 --> 50:03.080
the story of his boss's infidelity to the newspaper?

50:03.560 --> 50:05.120
It was you?

50:05.160 --> 50:06.800
I had no choice.

50:06.840 --> 50:09.160
But why? He... He was a good man.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.360
Apart from the affairs?

50:13.840 --> 50:15.320
Yes. Apart from the affairs.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.520
And the gun

50:17.800 --> 50:19.560
What are you talking about?

50:22.600 --> 50:24.680
Your husband was an illegal arms dealer.

50:27.120 --> 50:28.760
No!

50:28.800 --> 50:32.240
He was importing guns from South Africa and

50:28.800 --> 50:32.240
shipping them to Mexico.

50:32.280 --> 50:35.680
It's true, Charlotte. I've seen the evidence

50:32.280 --> 50:35.680
with my own eyes.

50:35.720 --> 50:37.200
Theo's right.

50:37.240 --> 50:40.520
He wanted Jacob removed from power,

50:40.560 --> 50:42.680
but you'd already achieved that by the time the article

50:42.720 --> 50:46.720
about his affair had been published,

50:42.720 --> 50:46.720
so you didn't kill him either.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.040
And then there were two.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.920
The doting wife, loyal to the last.

50:56.880 --> 50:58.240
And a young son who'd just been betrayed

50:58.280 --> 51:01.000
when his father had slept with his girlfriend.

51:01.040 --> 51:05.640
See, that's what I realised about this earlier today,

51:01.040 --> 51:05.640
this case was

51:05.680 --> 51:09.120
never about Jacob's affair, or his gun-running,

51:05.680 --> 51:09.120
not directly anyway.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.480
I didn't kill him!

51:13.520 --> 51:15.920
You're right. You didn't kill him.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.920
It was your mother.

51:15.960 --> 51:19.000
Charlotte, you killed Jacob Doran.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.280
No!

51:20.320 --> 51:21.480
I told you.

51:21.520 --> 51:22.920
I stood by Jacob

51:22.960 --> 51:25.320
our whole marriage, despite the affairs.

51:25.360 --> 51:27.600
And that's why he had to die.

51:27.640 --> 51:30.240
Because that night you discovered that you may have

51:30.280 --> 51:32.880
stood by your husband, but he wasn't going to stand by you.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.640
Was he?

51:34.680 --> 51:37.440
We found your husband's bag on the beach.

51:37.480 --> 51:40.240
It's the bag that tells us his suicide note was fake.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.320
While also being real. And only you could have

51:42.360 --> 51:44.400
worked it out.

51:44.440 --> 51:46.240
Only you went after him when he went for his walk.

51:47.960 --> 51:51.240
<i>You didn't lose him,</i> <i>like you told us.</i>

51:47.960 --> 51:51.240
<i>You followed him.</i>

51:51.280 --> 51:53.360
HUMPHREY: <i> I think you sensed</i> <i>that Jacob was</i>

51:51.280 --> 51:53.360
<i>up to something.</i>

51:56.840 --> 51:58.880
<i>So you followed him</i> <i>down to the beach</i>

51:56.840 --> 51:58.880
<i>which is where you</i>

51:58.920 --> 52:01.520
<i>saw him burying the bag</i> <i>in the sand.</i>

52:01.560 --> 52:03.320
<i>You didn't know</i> <i>what was in it.</i>

52:03.360 --> 52:05.120
<i>But you were</i> <i>going to find out.</i>

52:09.920 --> 52:13.840
CAMILLE: <i> Once Jacob left,</i> <i>you dug up the bag</i>

52:09.920 --> 52:13.840
<i>and found clothes, money,</i>

52:13.880 --> 52:16.040
<i>passport and a gun.</i>

52:16.080 --> 52:18.440
All the things he'd need to carry out his plan.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.480
Which was quite simple, really.

52:20.520 --> 52:22.160
With the publication of his affair,

52:22.200 --> 52:24.680
Jacob knew his days as a minister

52:22.200 --> 52:24.680
were numbered.

52:24.720 --> 52:27.160
How long before his replacement discovered

52:24.720 --> 52:27.160
that Jacob had been

52:27.200 --> 52:31.840
abusing his position in the Ministry and dealing

52:27.200 --> 52:31.840
in illegal weapons?

52:31.880 --> 52:35.560
So he decided to fake his own death and skip the country.

52:35.600 --> 52:39.160
First, he placed a bag with everything he'd need

52:35.600 --> 52:39.160
to run away.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.600
And then he wrote a note,

52:41.640 --> 52:43.800
telling the world he was going to commit suicide.

52:45.560 --> 52:49.320
He then planned to go down to the beach where he'd undress

52:49.360 --> 52:51.360
and step into the sea,

52:51.400 --> 52:54.840
so it would look like he'd swum out into the ocean

52:51.400 --> 52:54.840
to his own death.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.520
When in reality, all he had to do was swim

52:56.560 --> 52:59.640
further along the beach to where he planted his bag.

52:59.680 --> 53:03.800
And get dressed in the clothes he'd placed there earlier.

53:03.840 --> 53:07.680
Meaning he was now free to leave the island,

53:03.840 --> 53:07.680
or no doubt on the next

53:07.720 --> 53:10.120
boat he could get to his gun-running friends in Mexico.

53:10.160 --> 53:12.760
Not that you knew the specific details, I'm sure,

53:12.800 --> 53:14.240
but you got the general drift.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.560
Jacob was abandoning you.

53:17.600 --> 53:21.280
And after all those decades you'd stood by him.

53:21.320 --> 53:24.400
<i>While he'd concentrated</i> <i>on his career rather than you.</i>

53:24.440 --> 53:26.080
<i>After all the affairs</i> <i>and now it was</i>

53:26.120 --> 53:27.840
<i>him who was</i> <i>running out on you.</i>

53:27.880 --> 53:29.800
<i>You weren't prepared to let</i> <i>that happen.</i>

53:29.840 --> 53:31.720
<i>They're running it.</i>

53:31.760 --> 53:33.760
HUMPHREY: <i> So you made a plan.</i> <i>When you came back</i>

53:31.760 --> 53:33.760
<i>from the beach that</i>

53:33.800 --> 53:36.080
<i>night, you brought</i> <i>something with you.</i>

53:36.120 --> 53:38.280
<i>Your husband's gun.</i>

53:38.320 --> 53:39.680
<i>So as you told us,</i>

53:39.720 --> 53:42.480
<i>you believed in</i> <i>your marriage vows.</i>

53:42.520 --> 53:44.880
<i>You were husband and wife.</i>

53:44.920 --> 53:49.800
<i>Together. Forever.</i> <i>Till death do you part!</i>

53:54.720 --> 53:57.640
CAMILLE: <i> But when you</i> <i>killed him, you knew you only</i>

53:54.720 --> 53:57.640
<i>had seconds to</i>

53:57.680 --> 53:59.480
<i>set the scene.</i>

53:59.520 --> 54:01.960
<i>Your son was in his room.</i>

54:02.000 --> 54:03.600
<i>Theo was on the veranda.</i>

54:03.640 --> 54:06.000
<i>They'd both have</i> <i>heard the gunshot.</i>

54:06.040 --> 54:08.000
<i>So how did you escape</i> <i>without being seen?</i>

54:09.480 --> 54:13.560
This is what we realised, we don't think you did.

54:13.600 --> 54:16.240
<i>Because, in the confusion,</i> <i>who would notice</i>

54:16.280 --> 54:20.760
<i>if you had entered</i> <i>the room through the door,</i>

54:16.280 --> 54:20.760
<i>or from behind it?</i>

54:24.640 --> 54:25.800
Dad!

54:28.920 --> 54:30.400
I'm sorry.

54:32.760 --> 54:33.880
Please.

54:51.800 --> 54:54.680
Thank you. But I'm going to stay on the island

54:54.720 --> 54:56.240
a bit longer, I think.

55:15.560 --> 55:17.880
Right, erm, I think I'll just...

55:19.160 --> 55:20.200
Yes.

55:23.880 --> 55:28.640
You know, I'm glad I finally got to meet you.

55:28.680 --> 55:30.640
You are?

55:30.680 --> 55:33.240
All my life, you've been like a spectre.

55:33.280 --> 55:35.360
A shadow hanging over me.

55:35.400 --> 55:37.000
And now I'm not?

55:37.040 --> 55:38.960
Now I know exactly who you are.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.120
Camille, I should have done more.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.360
You did just enough.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.400
You left me to be raised by my mother,

55:49.440 --> 55:51.040
and that's the best gift you could have given me.

55:52.960 --> 55:54.280
I want to give you something.

55:55.560 --> 55:57.120
What is it?

55:57.160 --> 56:00.520
It's my address. In St Lucia. Maybe one day...

56:00.560 --> 56:02.280
You write to me.

56:03.440 --> 56:04.520
Then we'll see.

56:28.240 --> 56:31.320
Man alive, that is what I call getting a round in.

56:31.360 --> 56:35.360
Come on, Chief, it's thirsty work

56:31.360 --> 56:35.360
catching criminals, you know.

56:35.400 --> 56:36.640
Camille!

56:39.480 --> 56:41.680
Camille, you have to believe me,

56:41.720 --> 56:44.720
I only ever wanted to do what was best for you.

56:44.760 --> 56:45.920
You did.

56:45.960 --> 56:47.200
I did?

56:47.240 --> 56:48.920
You did the best for me every day of my life.

56:50.280 --> 56:51.760
Oh!

56:58.280 --> 56:59.560
You know what, Catherine?

56:59.600 --> 57:02.120
In your bar, I feel positively French.

57:02.160 --> 57:03.640
You do?

57:03.680 --> 57:06.240
Yes, so I think it only right that we celebrate your culture

57:06.280 --> 57:07.960
in the only way I know how.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
This is not French.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.320
What could be more French than French cricket?

57:13.360 --> 57:15.560
What...

57:15.600 --> 57:18.720
-Catherine, you're too short for a long leg!

57:15.600 --> 57:18.720
-Oh, thank you!

57:18.760 --> 57:21.040
And you're too long for a short leg.

57:18.760 --> 57:21.040
Fidel!

57:21.080 --> 57:22.520
I want you at extra cover on the boundary

57:22.560 --> 57:24.480
but look sharp, I want you in on the one.

57:24.520 --> 57:25.600
Yeah, okay!

57:25.640 --> 57:27.200
And what am I supposed to do?

57:27.240 --> 57:28.960
-Just hit it. -Okay.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.320
Don't worry, it takes time for even the best players to

57:31.360 --> 57:32.480
get their eye in.

57:32.520 --> 57:33.520
<i>Allez.</i>

57:34.640 --> 57:35.920
Ready?

57:35.960 --> 57:37.480
-Yes, sir! -Play!

57:46.320 --> 57:47.640
That's a six, Chief.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.680
It hasn't even hit the ground.

57:50.720 --> 57:52.000
Are you serious?

57:52.040 --> 57:53.200
I can still catch it!

57:53.240 --> 57:54.640
-No!

57:54.680 --> 57:56.320
-Yes! -CAMILLE: No!

57:56.360 --> 57:57.600
Yes!

58:02.520 --> 58:03.640
CAMILLE: Sir! Sir!

58:07.600 --> 58:10.080
How's that!

58:10.120 --> 58:12.160
So have you ever seen a Bonelli's Eagle, Alec?

58:12.200 --> 58:13.960
It's okay to say no.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.520
-Someone should teach him some manners.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.520
-Yes. They probably should.

58:16.560 --> 58:18.360
It's Mr Talbot. He's going without you!

58:18.400 --> 58:19.880
He's trying to see the Green first.

58:19.920 --> 58:21.120
Oh!

58:22.040 --> 58:23.600
-The world of

58:23.640 --> 58:26.560
bird watching may be slightly more cut-throat

58:23.640 --> 58:26.560
than one might assume.

58:26.600 --> 58:28.920
So you said you had a date tonight?

58:26.600 --> 58:28.920
What does he do for a living?
