00:04.901 --> 00:06.300
Yo, hurry up!

00:06.367 --> 00:08.367
Don't start without me.

00:08.434 --> 00:09.567
Move your ass.
come on.

00:09.634 --> 00:10.868
I'm gettin' your damn beer.

00:10.934 --> 00:11.868
Shut up!

00:11.934 --> 00:13.033
Shut up, woman.
shut up?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.801
Oh, me shut up, huh?

00:14.868 --> 00:16.801
Shut up, everyone.

00:23.601 --> 00:25.400
[laughing]

00:27.767 --> 00:30.334
Will, is that you?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.601
Will?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.400
Here he comes.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.601
Will?

00:40.200 --> 00:41.133
Ohh!
ohh!

00:41.200 --> 00:42.701
Ohh! ohh!

00:42.767 --> 00:43.934
He's down.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.200
Go on, get up.

00:48.000 --> 00:48.868
Get up.

00:48.934 --> 00:50.367
Don't be stupid.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.467
We don't want any trouble.

00:53.534 --> 00:56.200
Take whatever you want.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.033
[crying]

01:07.934 --> 01:09.501
I don't care
what you want.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.701
There's no reason
to hurt anyone.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.067
Here it comes.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.701
Woman: no!

01:17.767 --> 01:18.701
No.

01:18.767 --> 01:20.033
That had to hurt.

01:23.367 --> 01:26.968
How could you possibly...

01:27.033 --> 01:28.834
Know what my reasons are?

01:30.200 --> 01:32.200
Our boy's trying to get up.

01:32.267 --> 01:35.067
Which one of them
belongs to you?

01:37.501 --> 01:39.434
Let me guess.

01:41.634 --> 01:43.868
Woman: oh, please
don't hurt him! please.

01:43.934 --> 01:45.100
It could be her.

01:45.167 --> 01:46.100
[man groans]

01:46.167 --> 01:47.367
[woman whimpering]

01:49.434 --> 01:52.100
Kiss your husband
goodbye.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.667
William...

02:00.133 --> 02:02.834
Why are you doing this?

02:02.901 --> 02:04.734
Why?!

02:05.567 --> 02:06.734
Why not?

02:10.234 --> 02:12.734
Ooh!

02:12.801 --> 02:14.267
Did you get that?

02:14.334 --> 02:16.267
I got it, baby.

02:17.767 --> 02:20.534
Uh-huh. and how many dead?

02:21.634 --> 02:25.367
Ok. yeah, we'll be there
as soon as we can.

02:25.434 --> 02:26.701
Thanks.

02:26.767 --> 02:28.133
Well, i gotta go.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.667
Let me guess.
don't get comfortable.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.033
We've got 4 dead
in a home invasion.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.601
Where we headed?

02:33.667 --> 02:34.868
It's local.
southeast d.c.

02:34.934 --> 02:36.334
What was
the cause of death?

02:36.400 --> 02:37.701
Jj: blunt force trauma.
no knife, no gun.

02:37.767 --> 02:39.734
Have we been invited in?

02:39.801 --> 02:41.534
Yeah. cops want us to meet them
at the crime scene.

02:41.601 --> 02:44.033
Isn't southeast where
all that vandalism's
been lately?

02:44.100 --> 02:46.868
Same area, yeah.
think they could be connected?

02:46.934 --> 02:49.200
I don't know.
i mean, the weapon
doesn't exactly fit

02:49.267 --> 02:51.400
The typical m.o.
of a home invasion
killer.

02:51.467 --> 02:52.667
Well,
it's worth considering.

02:52.734 --> 02:54.467
It's common for vandalism
to escalate into violence.

02:54.534 --> 02:55.834
Plus there's a lot
of anger out there.

02:55.901 --> 02:57.968
That neighborhood's
mostly black working class.

02:58.033 --> 02:59.567
Yeah. now it's being
gentrified

02:59.634 --> 03:02.000
While the people
who live there
are having a tough time.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.501
Were the victims wealthy?

03:03.567 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, it was two couples.

03:05.067 --> 03:07.667
The were both part of
the influx of new wealth
in the area.

03:07.734 --> 03:09.000
Police report a robbery?

03:09.067 --> 03:10.000
Nothing was taken.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.634
What race
were the victims?

03:11.701 --> 03:13.467
One couple was white,
the other black.

03:13.534 --> 03:15.033
Not racially motivated.

03:15.100 --> 03:17.767
Jj, find rossi and reid,
tell them we leave in 5.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.567
Well, if this is related
to vandalism,

03:20.634 --> 03:21.901
4 dead is a hell of
an escalation.

03:21.968 --> 03:24.634
So there's the potential
for a lot more bodies
out there?

03:24.701 --> 03:26.534
That's what i'm afraid of.

"there is no lasting hope

Only temporary relief

[sirens]

04:32.334 --> 04:33.834
Detective andrews?

04:33.901 --> 04:36.567
Hi. jennifer jareau.

04:36.634 --> 04:39.100
These are agents rossi,
morgan,

04:39.167 --> 04:41.234
Hotchner, prentiss,
and dr. reid.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.934
Thanks for getting here
so fast.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.267
What can you tell us?

04:44.334 --> 04:45.934
Looks like one of the victims
was attacked

04:46.000 --> 04:47.434
When he got out of his car.

04:47.501 --> 04:49.267
Meaning whoever did this
probably used his keys

04:49.334 --> 04:51.434
To get inside
and surprise the other victims.

04:51.501 --> 04:52.934
Who found the bodies?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.367
The cleaning woman.

04:54.434 --> 04:55.868
She's giving her statement now.

04:55.934 --> 04:57.501
Dave, would you, morgan,
and prentiss go inside.

04:57.567 --> 04:58.968
We'll cover out here.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.300
I know you're all
used to this,

05:00.367 --> 05:03.801
But, uh, it's a hell
of a sight in there.

05:38.801 --> 05:41.567
Whoever did this
ain't human.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.100
The neighbors
see anything?

05:48.167 --> 05:49.601
Oh, you know,
the patrol cars

05:49.667 --> 05:50.934
Are even doubled
in this area

05:51.000 --> 05:52.767
Because of the vandalism--
nothing.

05:52.834 --> 05:56.300
The unsub would have
to be extremely fast
and efficient.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.801
Look at this. there's a pool
of blood here and then drops

05:58.868 --> 06:00.934
As the victim
moves toward the door.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
How big was the victim?

06:02.067 --> 06:04.200
6'1", 6'2". why?

06:04.267 --> 06:06.467
Well, if he was strong enough
to move under his own power,

06:06.534 --> 06:07.968
You'd expect signs
of a struggle.

06:08.033 --> 06:10.634
And if not, there'd
most likely be drag marks.

06:10.701 --> 06:12.133
He was carried.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.400
That's a lot of dead weight
for one person to move alone.

06:14.467 --> 06:15.834
There's no pool of blood
on the porch,

06:15.901 --> 06:18.467
Which means they didn't
have to set him down

06:18.534 --> 06:20.367
To open the door.

06:20.434 --> 06:23.734
Victim one
gets dropped here.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.767
While number 2
comes around the corner

06:25.834 --> 06:27.701
To see what's happening,
and...

06:29.133 --> 06:32.400
The unsub attacks him here.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.234
The female victims
were probably here

06:34.300 --> 06:36.334
When the first attack
occurred.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.901
Which means somebody
would have to control them
pretty quickly.

06:38.968 --> 06:40.968
How many unsubs
are you thinking?

06:41.033 --> 06:43.667
At least one
to move the body inside,

06:43.734 --> 06:45.868
Another one to take out
man number 2,

06:45.934 --> 06:48.434
And one more
to subdue the others.

06:48.501 --> 06:52.100
Well, vandalism breeds
a pack mentality.

06:52.167 --> 06:53.801
If it is
the same unsubs,

06:53.868 --> 06:56.133
We're looking at
a group of 3, maybe 4.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.434
These aren't kids.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.267
They're too efficient.

06:59.334 --> 07:01.167
There's a control
and precision.

07:01.234 --> 07:02.467
Juveniles are sloppy.

07:02.534 --> 07:03.667
Prentiss: he's right.

07:03.734 --> 07:06.234
There is nothing tentative
about these kills.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.934
There's no experimentation.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.133
These guys
know what they're doing.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.167
I don't know.

07:12.234 --> 07:14.334
What are you thinking?

07:14.400 --> 07:16.467
I can understand vandalism
escalating into violence,

07:16.534 --> 07:18.167
But that's usually gradual.

07:18.234 --> 07:19.968
And assault,
a single murder maybe,

07:20.067 --> 07:21.367
But come on, this?

07:21.434 --> 07:23.434
This feels fully evolved.

07:27.968 --> 07:29.367
September 3rd,

07:29.434 --> 07:32.300
15 luxury cars had
their windows smashed.

07:32.367 --> 07:33.734
September 14th,

07:33.801 --> 07:36.767
A new upscale clothing
boutique was vandalized.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.400
September 24th,

07:38.467 --> 07:40.300
Two different restaurants,

07:40.367 --> 07:42.300
Both catering
to a wealthy clientele,

07:42.367 --> 07:43.934
Had their front windows smashed

07:44.000 --> 07:47.767
And their interiors torn apart,
and finally, october 1st,

07:47.834 --> 07:50.200
A newly renovated townhome

07:50.267 --> 07:52.434
Was ransacked before
the family could move in.

07:52.501 --> 07:55.067
So they went from attacking
public property

07:55.133 --> 07:57.567
To a private residence,
but no victim.

07:57.634 --> 08:01.000
The question is, what makes them
move from that...to this?

08:01.067 --> 08:02.801
The vandalism targets
were all symbols

08:02.868 --> 08:04.968
Of the neighborhood's
changing makeup
and economy.

08:05.033 --> 08:07.033
Maybe there's something
specific about these victims

08:07.100 --> 08:08.100
That set the unsubs off.

08:08.167 --> 08:10.801
I've spoken to the victims'
family members.

08:10.868 --> 08:13.267
They've agreed to come in
and help however they can.

08:13.334 --> 08:15.000
Garcia, check
social networking sites.

08:15.067 --> 08:17.400
See if these unsubs
have coordinated
these attacks online.

08:17.467 --> 08:21.100
If they dare tweet,
i shall flush them out
like a bird dog, sir.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.734
We need to be asking
how these unsubs

08:23.801 --> 08:25.934
Manage to not stand out
in this neighborhood.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.667
Each of these crime scene
locations are a representation

08:28.734 --> 08:30.167
Of new wealth and status,

08:30.234 --> 08:32.501
But the area surrounding
the crime scenes

08:32.567 --> 08:34.234
Are still populated
by long-time residents

08:34.299 --> 08:35.667
Who are slowly
being pushed out.

08:35.734 --> 08:37.467
That's a lot of
disenfranchised people

08:37.534 --> 08:38.933
Who are all part of
the neighborhood makeup.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.534
Most likely these unsubs
don't stand out

08:40.601 --> 08:42.200
Because they're probably
local themselves.

08:42.267 --> 08:44.234
I don't know.
i'm with rossi.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.501
I mean, anger i get,
but this much violence?

08:47.567 --> 08:49.434
We're looking at
at least 3 men

08:49.501 --> 08:51.901
With an incredible
amount of rage.

08:51.968 --> 08:53.567
Where do you hide that?

08:58.801 --> 09:03.767
Turner. you care to tell
the lady why it's october 14th

09:03.834 --> 09:06.300
And she's still not ready
to move into her house?

09:06.367 --> 09:08.400
Not particularly.

09:08.467 --> 09:10.901
Man: what did you just say?

09:13.300 --> 09:15.634
It's ok. really.

09:15.701 --> 09:16.834
No, it's not.

09:16.901 --> 09:18.834
Why don't you apologize
to the lady,

09:18.901 --> 09:20.400
Answer the question.

09:20.467 --> 09:21.667
My apologies, ma'am.

09:21.734 --> 09:24.501
Found a slight flaw
in the foundation.

09:24.567 --> 09:27.200
Hate to think of you
home all alone at night,

09:27.267 --> 09:28.701
Suddenly the whole place

09:28.767 --> 09:30.734
Just collapses
underneath you.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.701
Ok.

09:34.767 --> 09:35.968
Now get back
to the drywall.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.234
That's what i pay you for.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.767
Let somebody else worry
about the foundation.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.234
I had garcia run records
on anyone in the target area

10:03.300 --> 10:05.901
Who in the last year
was foreclosed upon,
filed for bankruptcy,

10:05.968 --> 10:08.934
Or applied for unemployment
and then narrowed that list down

10:09.000 --> 10:10.400
To men between the ages
of 25 and 45.

10:10.467 --> 10:11.567
And?

10:11.634 --> 10:13.901
713 hits.

10:14.868 --> 10:17.400
Victims' families are here.

10:19.067 --> 10:21.234
I'm very sorry
about your son.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.767
We're looking to see
if there's a pattern

10:23.834 --> 10:26.934
Or if your son's killing
was truly random.

10:28.067 --> 10:31.701
So, there were no threats
that you knew of?

10:31.767 --> 10:33.767
No.

10:33.834 --> 10:37.667
I understand this is
very difficult for you.

10:37.734 --> 10:41.167
We're just trying to
make some sense of it.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.968
Please.

10:47.133 --> 10:50.400
Morgan: ms. barnes, do you
need some more time?

10:51.734 --> 10:56.400
Um...they said i could see
wiiam's body if i wanted to.

10:56.467 --> 10:59.968
I don't see what good
could come from that.

11:06.334 --> 11:08.400
It was just you
and your brother?

11:08.467 --> 11:11.367
Our parents died
a few years ago.

11:11.434 --> 11:13.434
I'm sorry.

11:15.601 --> 11:18.767
I know that sounds like
something people say,

11:18.834 --> 11:22.100
But...i truly am sorry.

11:23.801 --> 11:26.834
You deal with cases
like this all the time.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.567
Yes, i do.

11:30.634 --> 11:32.300
So it's routine for you.

11:32.367 --> 11:35.734
There's nothing routine
about what you're
going through, ms. barnes.

11:38.167 --> 11:40.667
Do you have brothers
and sisters?

11:43.167 --> 11:45.300
I have two sisters.

11:45.367 --> 11:49.567
What would you do
if something like this
happened to one of them?

11:51.100 --> 11:55.133
I would do everything
in my power to catch
the people who did it.

12:01.934 --> 12:02.868

12:02.934 --> 12:04.501
Is that you?
will?

12:04.567 --> 12:06.934
Check this out.

Whoa, man.

12:19.734 --> 12:20.968
Please, don't hurt him!

12:21.067 --> 12:22.067
That's pretty wicked.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.033
Yeah.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.033
Will.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.834
Oh! oh!

12:26.901 --> 12:28.200
[song continues]

12:28.267 --> 12:29.834
Hey, come look at this.

12:31.801 --> 12:33.067
What did you just say?

12:35.367 --> 12:36.934
What's his problem?

12:38.834 --> 12:41.634
Our boy's tryin'
to get up.

12:41.701 --> 12:43.934
Please, don't hurt him!

12:44.000 --> 12:45.400
Please.

12:45.467 --> 12:48.167
I say we go out.

12:49.467 --> 12:52.501
[song continues]

12:52.567 --> 12:54.968
[woman crying]

12:55.033 --> 12:57.033
Why are you doing this?

12:57.100 --> 12:59.100
Why?!

12:59.167 --> 13:00.601
Why not?

13:00.667 --> 13:02.067
Aah!

13:02.133 --> 13:03.334
Did you get that?

13:03.400 --> 13:04.901
I got it.

13:58.901 --> 14:01.868
[heart beating rapidly]

14:07.834 --> 14:09.400
[whistles]

14:29.701 --> 14:31.667
You think?

14:37.067 --> 14:38.667
People might see.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.534
So?

14:42.834 --> 14:45.534
I go first.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.167
This your car?

15:19.234 --> 15:20.534
Yeah.

15:20.601 --> 15:22.367
It's nice.

15:23.634 --> 15:25.634
Look, i'm just picking up
my girlfriend.

15:27.133 --> 15:28.300
[whistles]

15:39.300 --> 15:41.434
What the hell, man!

15:43.834 --> 15:46.133
Shh.

16:05.968 --> 16:07.434
Did anybody see anything?

16:07.501 --> 16:09.567
It's in the middle
of the damn parking lot.

16:09.634 --> 16:10.934
What about the security cam?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.133
It's only on the door.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.367
Who's the lady
over there?

16:13.434 --> 16:14.868
Manager. she discovered
the bodies

16:14.934 --> 16:17.300
When she came by to open up
for the breakfast crowd.

16:17.367 --> 16:18.367
I'll go talk to her.

16:18.434 --> 16:19.300
Any idea
who the victims are?

16:19.367 --> 16:20.601
Judging by the driver's license,

16:20.667 --> 16:22.767
One of them's a waitress here.
it says jessica miller,

16:22.834 --> 16:24.934
And the other one's
probably doug taylor.

16:25.000 --> 16:25.968
You can't tell for sure?

16:26.067 --> 16:27.367
Honestly, you can't
make an i.d.

16:27.434 --> 16:28.801
By looking at them.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.601
Hotch.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.400
I didn't even know
what it was at first

16:36.467 --> 16:38.200
When i pulled up.

16:38.267 --> 16:40.400
They're definitely
getting bolder.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.734
These kills
were in public.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.734
If this is supposed to be about
symbolism, it's not anymore.

16:44.801 --> 16:47.334
This is a blue collar
restaurant,
the victim is a waitress.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.834
There's no ideology
behind this.

16:48.901 --> 16:50.434
It's about violence
and power.

16:50.501 --> 16:52.634
They actually sat here
and drank beer
after the murders.

16:52.701 --> 16:54.667
They're telling us
that they don't care.

16:54.734 --> 16:56.267
They're like
those outlaws
that ride into town

16:56.334 --> 16:57.801
And let you know
the only way
to stop them

16:57.868 --> 16:59.033
Is by killing them.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.968
If that's what they want,
i know plenty of cops

17:01.033 --> 17:02.267
Who'd be happy to oblige.

17:02.334 --> 17:03.634
Detective, we need
to keep our heads.

17:03.701 --> 17:04.867
Meaning what?

17:04.934 --> 17:06.701
Meaning that this level
of nihilism,

17:06.767 --> 17:08.968
This randomness,
it can have a mirror impact.

17:09.032 --> 17:11.267
Are you warning me
not to go after
some kind of revenge?

17:11.334 --> 17:13.467
All i'm saying
is this level of brutality

17:13.534 --> 17:15.534
Is almost like a challenge
from the unsubs,

17:15.601 --> 17:17.434
Trying to drag everyone
down to their level.

17:17.501 --> 17:19.767
And it's a natural reaction.

17:19.834 --> 17:22.267
I'm just doing my job.

17:26.434 --> 17:29.400
Let's head back.
we've got our profile.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.300
[elevator dings]

17:36.200 --> 17:37.133
How bad?

17:37.200 --> 17:39.534
Bad bad.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.367
You have company.

18:00.367 --> 18:01.501
Ms. barnes.

18:01.567 --> 18:03.167
Hi.

18:03.234 --> 18:05.033
Sorry for just
showing up like this.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.934
I heard on the news that
there were more victims

18:07.000 --> 18:10.501
And i didn't know where else
to get answers.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.701
Please.

18:16.934 --> 18:18.267
Thank you.

18:19.767 --> 18:22.868
So is it true?
was it the same people
who killed william?

18:24.601 --> 18:25.834
Yes.

18:25.901 --> 18:27.567
Do you have
any suspects?

18:27.634 --> 18:29.801
No, but we do have a profile
of who these men might be.

18:29.868 --> 18:32.133
Two of our agents are giving it
to the police right now

18:32.200 --> 18:34.167
And we're getting it
to all the news outlets.

18:34.234 --> 18:35.968
Can you explain it
to me?

18:36.033 --> 18:37.601
Please.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.667
Basically, these men are
completely disenfranchised.

18:41.734 --> 18:43.868
They feel like they have
nothing to live for.

18:43.934 --> 18:46.534
And they're looking for
anyone or anything to blame.

18:46.601 --> 18:48.934
Hotch: there's a lot
of anger out there.
times are tough.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.467
But even so, these men
will stand out.

18:51.534 --> 18:53.634
They'll look to provoke
confrontation.

18:53.701 --> 18:55.734
Any excuse, they'll take it.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.267
They don't steal
from their victims.

18:57.334 --> 18:58.734
They don't sexually
assault the women.

18:58.801 --> 19:01.400
This is about violence
for violence's sake.

19:01.467 --> 19:03.601
It's almost contagious.
it's twisted.

19:03.667 --> 19:06.000
But it's got
its own momentum.

19:06.067 --> 19:09.934
What we need to do
is figure out how
these men came together.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.067
Rossi: we feel certain
that they have some
connection to southeast d.c.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.467
Hotch:
they go unnoticed.

19:15.534 --> 19:17.734
They don't seem
out of place.

19:17.801 --> 19:19.200
We have no prints
from the crime scenes,

19:19.267 --> 19:21.467
So we believe that
the unsubs wear gloves.

19:21.534 --> 19:22.634
Dna testing
could take weeks,

19:22.701 --> 19:24.133
And we don't have
that kind of time.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.033
The majority of the population
of southeast is black,

19:27.100 --> 19:28.934
But if the unsubs
work in this area,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.467
They could be any race.

19:31.534 --> 19:33.634
Hotch: because of
the physical nature
of the murders

19:33.701 --> 19:36.100
And the amount of control
these unsubs exert
over their victims,

19:36.167 --> 19:37.534
We believe that
these unsubs are large

19:37.601 --> 19:39.534
Or at least extremely
physically fit.

19:39.601 --> 19:41.367
And they have
a pack mentality.

19:41.434 --> 19:43.100
Canvass the local bars
and restaurants.

19:43.167 --> 19:45.767
See if there's a group of men
who fit this description.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.100
And these men
will be obsessed with
the media coverage.

19:48.167 --> 19:50.234
Any chance
to relive their crimes.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.000
So stake out
the past crime scenes.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.901
There's a good chance
that they'll revisit them.

19:53.968 --> 19:56.067
They most likely come
from troubled backgrounds,

19:56.133 --> 19:58.567
Broken homes,
youth detention centers.

19:58.634 --> 20:00.434
They probably bonded
over their anger.

20:00.501 --> 20:02.567
And now it's like
they've become one person.

20:02.634 --> 20:04.667
It's their whole identity.

20:04.734 --> 20:06.567
See, these guys,
they think of themselves

20:06.634 --> 20:07.901
As some type of gangsters,

20:07.968 --> 20:11.234
Like society's rules don't
apply to them.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.767
They equate violence
with power and respect.

20:13.834 --> 20:17.801
And that goes for
self-respect as well.

20:21.067 --> 20:24.000
What could they possibly
get out of killing
innocent people

20:24.067 --> 20:25.334
For no reason?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.167
People like this,
they're not like you and me.

20:27.234 --> 20:29.234
They don't feel empathy.

20:29.300 --> 20:30.801
In a way, they only feel alive

20:30.868 --> 20:32.501
When they're creating
fear and chaos.

20:32.567 --> 20:35.067
And your profiles, they
help catch these people?

20:35.133 --> 20:36.868
They do.

20:38.934 --> 20:42.901
Thank you for helping me
through this.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.901
Of course.

20:58.601 --> 21:00.634
Detective.

21:05.634 --> 21:07.801
I just wanted to say
that at the crime scene

21:07.868 --> 21:11.000
It was not my intention
to accuse you of being
unprofessional.

21:11.067 --> 21:12.534
Yeah?

21:12.601 --> 21:14.067
It's just that
i know what it's like

21:14.133 --> 21:15.968
To work a case that
makes you question humanity,

21:16.033 --> 21:18.133
And it's not the worst thing
to remind yourself

21:18.200 --> 21:21.234
To rise above it a little,
or we lose ourselves.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.100
I appreciate you giving
the men the profile.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.000
Oh, no.

21:47.701 --> 21:48.968
Sir, i've got something.

21:49.033 --> 21:50.567
I've been monitoring
social networking sites

21:50.634 --> 21:52.367
To see if the unsubs
communicate electronically.

21:52.434 --> 21:54.033
Right.
there's a text
that's blowing up.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.367
I sent it to your phone.

21:55.434 --> 21:56.567
There's over a thousand
hits already.

21:56.634 --> 21:58.567
It's a plan to vandalize
cars and restaurants

21:58.634 --> 21:59.968
Around dupont circle.

22:00.033 --> 22:01.934
When does the text say
this is supposed to happen?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.434
Tonight, 9:00.

22:04.501 --> 22:07.100
Dupont circle's not in the
unsubs' usual comfort zone.

22:07.167 --> 22:08.734
And it's not like these
unsubs to share control.

22:08.801 --> 22:10.100
[dialing cell phone]

22:10.167 --> 22:13.167

22:13.234 --> 22:14.934
Detective andrews,
this is agent hotchner.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.434
I just sent you a text
to which we've been alerted.

22:17.501 --> 22:18.901
Right.

22:18.968 --> 22:20.801
Absolutely.
we're on our way.

22:20.868 --> 22:23.701
[sirens]

22:26.334 --> 22:28.834
Man on p.a.: you will
be arrested if you
do not disperse.

22:32.868 --> 22:35.601
We got wagons
at every entry point.

22:35.667 --> 22:39.300
They're filling them up
faster than i can bring them
to holding.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.601
What happened?

22:42.667 --> 22:44.934
My men went to make arrests,
people started resisting,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.400
I called for reinforcements.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.934
Do you know who
the instigators are?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.501
There's no rhyme or reason
i can tell.

22:54.667 --> 22:55.934
Confiscate the cell phones.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.467
When we get to the origins
of the text message,

22:57.534 --> 23:00.334
You'll have your ringleaders.

23:10.267 --> 23:13.400
They're still notifying
families and processing
most of the rioters.

23:13.467 --> 23:14.667
Did garcia come up
with anything?

23:14.734 --> 23:16.667
Yeah. she was able to isolate
the first 2 cell phones

23:16.734 --> 23:17.834
In the chain.

23:17.901 --> 23:19.567
Detective, we don't think
our unsubs are in there,

23:19.634 --> 23:21.300
But we'd still like to
interrogate

23:21.367 --> 23:22.467
The possible ringleaders.

23:22.534 --> 23:23.834
I don't think so.

23:23.901 --> 23:25.601
But we need to eliminate them
absolutely as suspects.

23:25.667 --> 23:27.367
We can handle it
on our own.

23:27.434 --> 23:30.200
Rossi: we're not saying
you can't.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.601
Is there a problem?

23:33.667 --> 23:36.367
You guys had my men
out there canvassing bars
looking for adults

23:36.434 --> 23:39.200
When i could have been doing
gang sweeps, going through
juvenile records.

23:39.267 --> 23:40.601
That would have been
a waste of your time.

23:40.667 --> 23:42.701
In case you hadn't noticed,
those are kids out there.

23:42.767 --> 23:44.534
We don't believe
last night's riot

23:44.601 --> 23:45.934
Is connected
to the murders.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.100
Oh? how could it not be?

23:47.167 --> 23:49.067
Because the unsubs
we're looking for are older.

23:49.133 --> 23:51.300
They operate entirely
out of southeast d.c.

23:51.367 --> 23:53.300
They exercise extreme
control over their victims,

23:53.367 --> 23:55.334
And violence is up close
and personal.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.767
None of what happened here
last night fits the profile.

23:57.834 --> 24:00.667
Enough with the profile.
i got probably a million
dollars worth of damage.

24:00.734 --> 24:02.334
I got two cops injured.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.868
Which was probably
made worse
by police overreaction.

24:04.934 --> 24:06.467
Meaning what?

24:06.534 --> 24:08.467
I warned you.
cases like this,
people get too emotional.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.734
You're here as a guest
of my department.

24:10.801 --> 24:12.701
Rossi: we're only
trying to help.

24:12.767 --> 24:14.834
If you're so sure none of
those kids are the killers,

24:14.901 --> 24:16.767
Why bother
interrogating them at all?

24:16.834 --> 24:19.100
Because
we need to be certain.

24:19.167 --> 24:22.000
If we're right,
if this is just some
sort of teenage dare,

24:22.067 --> 24:23.501
I guarantee you
that the unsubs

24:23.567 --> 24:25.033
Are going to respond
very quickly.

24:25.100 --> 24:26.234
I appreciate your insight,

24:26.300 --> 24:28.400
But we'd like to take things
from here on our own.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.267
Thank you
for everything you've done.

24:32.033 --> 24:35.200
You're gonna want to start
with these 2 names.

24:36.868 --> 24:40.467
You're not helping.
i want to speak to
the officer in charge.

24:40.534 --> 24:41.767
Ms. barnes.

24:41.834 --> 24:43.934
I need someone to tell me
what's going on.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.234
We're trying
to figure it out.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.534
Are those the ones
who killed william?

24:47.601 --> 24:48.901
No, they're not.

24:48.968 --> 24:50.033
But they started the riot.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.667
They're just a bunch
of stupid kids.

24:51.734 --> 24:54.467
Yeah, who vandalize
and attack people at random.

24:54.534 --> 24:56.367
I told you these things
have their own momentum.

24:56.434 --> 24:57.634
Are you sure?

24:57.701 --> 24:59.300
I'm sorry.

24:59.367 --> 25:00.701
So did you all
have fun, huh?

25:00.767 --> 25:03.100
Do you even care
that someone died?

25:03.167 --> 25:04.400
Ms. barnes, you really need
to calm down.

25:04.467 --> 25:05.634
That's not true.
no, no one cares.

25:05.701 --> 25:08.200
No one cares. someone
dies and it's all

25:08.267 --> 25:10.601
Just a game or a job
and everyone just moves on.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.767
That's not true.
people do care, and i care.

25:12.834 --> 25:14.734
They killed my brother
for no reason!

25:14.801 --> 25:16.400
Please.

25:16.467 --> 25:19.667
Let me walk you outside
and get you some air. please.

25:19.734 --> 25:21.601
Walk with me.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.501
It's ok.

25:24.567 --> 25:26.434
It's all right.

25:27.601 --> 25:29.167
I've logged into
police dispatch

25:29.234 --> 25:30.567
For the area
you've isolated.

25:30.634 --> 25:32.300
If anything's reported,
we'll know when they know.

25:32.367 --> 25:33.801
Wait, are we staying
on the case?

25:33.868 --> 25:37.133
We all know that these
unsubs are gonna react
to last night's riot.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.734
But emily's right.
they asked us to step aside.

25:39.801 --> 25:43.300
Andrews is a good cop.
he's just too emotional
right now.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.534
If we don't stay on, with
or without his permission,

25:45.601 --> 25:48.334
He and all the rest of us
will regret it.

25:50.267 --> 25:51.234
Where's morgan?

25:51.300 --> 25:54.133
Uh, he's with ms. barnes.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.467
Huh.

26:00.734 --> 26:02.567
You sure you're gonna be
all right?

26:02.634 --> 26:04.167
You know, i'm not crazy,
really.

26:04.234 --> 26:07.501
Tamara, you've been
through a trauma,

26:07.567 --> 26:09.601
And you're
processing a lot.

26:09.667 --> 26:11.701
It's normal
to lose it a little.

26:12.734 --> 26:14.000
Thank you.

26:14.067 --> 26:15.267
For everything.

26:15.334 --> 26:16.767
I'm just doing my job.

26:16.834 --> 26:18.767
No, you're...

26:18.834 --> 26:20.868
You're a good person.

26:26.968 --> 26:29.534
So how's this gonna end?

26:33.334 --> 26:34.801
What?

26:36.901 --> 26:40.267
The investigation.
i mean, what happens?

26:40.334 --> 26:41.634
Well, if i had to guess,

26:41.701 --> 26:45.167
Last night's riots--
our unsubs aren't
gonna like it.

26:45.234 --> 26:46.767
This is their
whole identity.

26:46.834 --> 26:48.734
They're not gonna like
sharing the attention.

26:48.801 --> 26:51.167
So more people are gonna die.

26:51.234 --> 26:53.133
They're killing
in a small area.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.334
Our profile is solid.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.400
Somebody
will recognize them.

26:57.467 --> 27:00.167
You don't think it's gonna be
that easy.

27:04.534 --> 27:06.734
I really need to get
back to my team.

27:06.801 --> 27:07.934
Yeah. i'm sorry.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.434
Thank you for, uh,
driving me home.

27:10.501 --> 27:12.033
You're welcome.

27:24.467 --> 27:26.767
Agent morgan.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.734
Do you think you can
get these guys?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.734
We're closing in.

27:33.801 --> 27:36.067
And they're bound to start
feeling it.

27:36.133 --> 27:38.701
See, guys like this,
when they feel trapped,

27:38.767 --> 27:41.701
They most likely
commit suicide by cop.

27:43.300 --> 27:45.567
Good.

28:15.067 --> 28:17.467
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

28:18.601 --> 28:20.234
I talked to the beat cops.

28:20.300 --> 28:22.467
They're getting word out
to local businesses

28:22.534 --> 28:24.200
To keep an eye out for
anyone who seems agitated

28:24.267 --> 28:25.767
By the news of
last night's riot.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.667
By now, andrews has to know

28:27.734 --> 28:29.601
That none of those kids
are the unsubs.

28:29.667 --> 28:32.000
Then he's bound to beef up
police presence
in the southeast.

28:32.067 --> 28:33.300
We should be there, too.

28:33.367 --> 28:35.167
The faster we can react,
the more we can help.

28:35.234 --> 28:36.901
Do you think the unsubs
know about the riot?

28:36.968 --> 28:39.133
Front page news.
i don't know how they can't.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.667
And if the profile's right?

28:40.734 --> 28:42.734
Their reaction's
gonna be quick and
it's gonna be brutal.

28:42.801 --> 28:46.334
Basically, it's like knowing
that lightning is gonna strike

28:46.400 --> 28:48.934
But not being able
to pinpoint where.

29:10.801 --> 29:12.767
[door closes]

29:12.834 --> 29:16.334
* the summer wind *

29:16.400 --> 29:17.934
* came blowing in *

29:18.000 --> 29:19.133
3 drafts.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.634
* from across the sea *

29:23.667 --> 29:26.834
* and lingered there... *

29:29.567 --> 29:32.667
I'm sorry, you can't
have that in here.

29:32.734 --> 29:34.000
What?

29:34.067 --> 29:35.534
This?

29:35.601 --> 29:37.167
It's a liability issue,
that's all,

29:37.234 --> 29:39.767
In case somebody gets hurt.

29:39.834 --> 29:42.000
* and then we strolled *

29:42.067 --> 29:44.901
* that golden sand... *
no problem.

29:46.901 --> 29:53.601
* two sweethearts
and the summer wind *

29:54.434 --> 29:55.667
Hey.

29:55.734 --> 29:57.534
Can we have a talk?

29:57.601 --> 29:59.701
Yeah. what's up?

29:59.767 --> 30:01.667
Uh, first i would like
to say that i love you,

30:01.734 --> 30:03.300
And i--i--the thing i love
the most about you

30:03.367 --> 30:05.334
Is how much you care
about people--

30:05.400 --> 30:06.234
Garcia, what?

30:06.300 --> 30:07.567
What's going on?

30:07.634 --> 30:10.801
I think you need to cut
contact with tamara barnes.

30:10.868 --> 30:12.367
I didn't make contact
with her.

30:12.434 --> 30:13.634
She was at the police station.

30:13.701 --> 30:15.200
Yeah, ok, look me
in the eye and tell me

30:15.267 --> 30:16.634
That the first break
in this case

30:16.701 --> 30:18.534
You don't run right
to her and give her
the news yourself.

30:18.601 --> 30:20.400
Penelope, she lost her brother.
she just wants answers.

30:20.467 --> 30:22.601
I get it. i volunteer
counseling these families.

30:22.667 --> 30:23.901
I know what
she's going through.

30:23.968 --> 30:25.834
Then where is this
coming from?

30:25.901 --> 30:28.234
Ok, let's just ignore
the whole ethical dilemma,

30:28.300 --> 30:29.901
'cause that's
just too, too big.

30:29.968 --> 30:31.534
And if you were
to testify on this case,

30:31.601 --> 30:32.767
The whole thing
would unravel

30:32.834 --> 30:34.634
If anyone were to find out
that you're involved

30:34.701 --> 30:35.901
With a member
of the victim's family.

30:35.968 --> 30:36.934
Whoa, stop.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.434
I love you,

30:38.501 --> 30:40.334
And i respect you.
you know that.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.467
But right now
you're way out of bounds.

30:42.534 --> 30:44.200
I'm not involved.

30:44.267 --> 30:46.801
The team is here
working on a case,

30:46.868 --> 30:48.634
And you're with her.

30:48.701 --> 30:50.100
You're involved.

30:50.167 --> 30:51.100
For your information,

30:51.167 --> 30:53.200
She lost it
back at the station,

30:53.267 --> 30:54.501
So i drove her home.

30:54.567 --> 30:55.567
End of story.

30:55.634 --> 30:57.667
But not for her.
derek,

30:57.734 --> 31:01.434
She's so sad and
so confused and angry

31:01.501 --> 31:04.601
And desperately looking
for anyone to swoop in
and make it all better,

31:04.667 --> 31:06.534
And unless you're
all in and can be there

31:06.601 --> 31:08.067
For every stage
of the grieving process,

31:08.133 --> 31:10.400
You're just another
reason for her
to not trust the world.

31:10.467 --> 31:12.801
She's simply trying to
understand why this happened.

31:12.868 --> 31:15.701
There is no why,
and she'll make herself
crazy trying to find one.

31:15.767 --> 31:16.801
[footsteps approaching]

31:16.868 --> 31:18.300
Don't tell me.

31:18.367 --> 31:19.968
Bar in southeast, 2 dead.

31:20.033 --> 31:22.067
They're waiting for you.

31:22.133 --> 31:23.200
I got to go.

31:23.267 --> 31:24.400
Yeah.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.300
[siren]

31:37.334 --> 31:39.701
What are you doing here?

31:39.767 --> 31:42.067
Detective, we can argue
about this later.

31:42.133 --> 31:45.367
Right now you have a crime scene
and we're here to help.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.534
They nailed the bartender's
hands to the bar first.

31:59.734 --> 32:02.434
Other bastard
got off easier.

32:02.501 --> 32:04.467
They just plain beat him.

32:04.534 --> 32:06.334
I'm getting real sick
of us being right

32:06.400 --> 32:07.801
And it just not mattering.

32:07.868 --> 32:09.767
What?
this is weird.

32:09.834 --> 32:12.267
The unsubs
are extremely physical.

32:12.334 --> 32:15.734
They beat their victims
mercilessly
with blunt objects.

32:15.801 --> 32:17.534
Why aren't these nails
pounded in?

32:17.601 --> 32:19.200
Probably used a nail gun.

32:19.267 --> 32:21.400
With all the gentrification
and turnover in housing

32:21.467 --> 32:23.834
In the neighborhood,
what's a common sight
these days?

32:23.901 --> 32:26.801
Builders,
contractors, and
construction workers.

32:26.868 --> 32:28.968
We wouldn't give it
a second thought.

32:29.033 --> 32:30.434
Morgan: wait a minute.

32:30.501 --> 32:33.434
Killing 4 people in that
first home invasion--

32:33.501 --> 32:35.501
That never made sense to me.

32:35.567 --> 32:38.801
Unsubs build
to something like that.

32:38.868 --> 32:41.167
What if this wasn't
their first murder?

32:41.234 --> 32:44.534
The first two rounds
of vandalism,
they were typical.

32:44.601 --> 32:48.300
Car windows smashed,
restaurants with
the plate glass broken.

32:48.367 --> 32:52.033
But that last case,
right before the home invasion,

32:52.100 --> 32:54.501
That was a random
construction site.

32:54.567 --> 32:56.834
A single-family townhouse.

32:56.901 --> 32:58.300
Prentiss, you flagged it
yourself.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.334
Yeah, yeah.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.000
[dialing]

33:02.067 --> 33:03.834
Hey, garcia.

33:03.901 --> 33:07.367
I need the address
on that townhouse
that was vandalized.

33:08.534 --> 33:11.033
I don't understand
how we can help.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.834
Sir, we believe that whoever
vandalized your house

33:12.901 --> 33:14.400
Is responsible for
the murders in the area.

33:14.467 --> 33:16.200
Oh, i know.
we've read the papers.

33:16.267 --> 33:18.434
But, honestly, that's not
something we're gonna
think about right now.

33:18.501 --> 33:19.567
We also think
it's possible

33:19.634 --> 33:21.534
That your home was
vandalized for a reason.

33:21.601 --> 33:23.467
What do you mean?

33:23.534 --> 33:25.801
May we?

33:27.934 --> 33:29.300
Yes, please.

33:29.367 --> 33:31.501
Thank you.

33:32.834 --> 33:34.801
We believe there may
have been another murder

33:34.868 --> 33:37.367
Before the first one
the police became aware of.

33:37.434 --> 33:40.234
You think there might be
a body hidden here,
on our property?

33:40.300 --> 33:43.033
It's possible.
at the very least,
the men we're looking for

33:43.100 --> 33:44.234
May have worked here.

33:44.300 --> 33:45.467
Oh, my god.

33:45.534 --> 33:47.634
Were there any issues with
workers during construction?

33:47.701 --> 33:48.801
No, nothing.

33:48.868 --> 33:50.767
Did anyone appear
overly confrontational?

33:50.834 --> 33:53.367
I just had contact
with our contractor,
and he was friendly.

33:53.434 --> 33:55.501
I understand people come
and go during construction,

33:55.567 --> 33:58.400
But was there anyone at all
that you may have noticed

33:58.467 --> 34:00.267
Suddenly wasn't around?

34:00.334 --> 34:01.267
Oh, no.

34:01.334 --> 34:02.300
What is it?

34:02.367 --> 34:04.100
The contractor
i mentioned...

34:04.167 --> 34:07.501
After the vandalism,
we called him
to oversee the repairs.

34:07.567 --> 34:08.801
He never called us back.

34:08.868 --> 34:10.634
The police report said
that every room

34:10.701 --> 34:12.833
In the house
was destroyed except one.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.567
Yeah, they smashed every
room except the nursery.
that one they didn't touch.

34:15.634 --> 34:17.033
We need to see it.

34:31.766 --> 34:33.833
[door opens]

34:52.300 --> 34:55.199
This wall is structural.

34:59.701 --> 35:03.467
I wouldn't ask you this
unless i felt it was
incredibly important.

35:03.534 --> 35:04.868
I need to open up
this wall.

35:04.934 --> 35:05.767
No.

35:05.834 --> 35:06.934
We can't live here
and not know.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.534
Ma'am,

35:08.601 --> 35:12.033
I promise you, even if
i have to do every bit
of the work myself,

35:12.100 --> 35:13.467
This wall will be repaired

35:13.534 --> 35:16.434
And it'll go right back
to being exactly
what you want.

35:17.801 --> 35:19.234
Please?

35:19.300 --> 35:20.567
Ok.

35:24.767 --> 35:26.634
This is agent emily prentiss
with the fbi.

35:26.701 --> 35:29.901
I need an scsi unit.

35:35.868 --> 35:39.434
We've got a body.

35:56.784 --> 35:58.651
I can't be here.

36:00.184 --> 36:02.351
Let's move over here.

36:05.084 --> 36:07.384
Is there someplace
the two of you can stay?

36:07.451 --> 36:09.684
Yes. we have friends
i can call.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.850
After you give
the police a statement,

36:11.917 --> 36:13.451
They can take you
to your friends' house.

36:13.517 --> 36:15.150
Thank you.

36:15.217 --> 36:16.983
Thank you.

36:20.451 --> 36:23.551
You think they'll be ok?

36:23.617 --> 36:25.250
I don't know.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.917
I mean, you redo
your dream home,

36:27.983 --> 36:30.718
About to start
a new chapter
of your life,

36:30.784 --> 36:33.384
And then this?

36:33.451 --> 36:35.017
How did you know?

36:36.617 --> 36:38.351
The other crime scenes
were brutal.

36:38.417 --> 36:40.184
But it also had control.

36:40.250 --> 36:41.584
They took their time,
that type of m.o.

36:41.651 --> 36:44.384
Had to start before
the home invasions.

36:44.451 --> 36:46.883
This entire place
was destroyed
except this room. why?

36:46.950 --> 36:48.883
Because they took the time
to rebuild the wall

36:48.950 --> 36:50.217
Once they buried the contractor.

36:50.284 --> 36:51.217
Exactly.

36:51.284 --> 36:52.718
If they smashed
this place up,

36:52.784 --> 36:54.484
He could have been
discovered.

36:54.551 --> 36:56.484
But still, a body
inside the wall?

36:56.551 --> 36:59.184
It's like
a builders tradition.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.617
You leave a little
something behind

37:00.684 --> 37:03.084
To send a message
to the people who may
do work down the road.

37:03.150 --> 37:04.883
Front page
of a newspaper.

37:04.950 --> 37:06.451
A photo of the
construction crew.

37:06.517 --> 37:08.651
It's like
a time capsule.

37:08.718 --> 37:10.217
Ok.

37:10.284 --> 37:14.384
Ok, so what would you need
to rebuild this wall?

37:14.451 --> 37:15.584
Drywall, brickwork,

37:15.651 --> 37:17.551
Electrical?

37:17.617 --> 37:19.351
I'm gonna call garcia.

37:21.517 --> 37:24.250
[line ringing]

37:24.317 --> 37:25.250
Hey, girl.

37:25.317 --> 37:26.250
Hey.

37:26.317 --> 37:27.184
Are we good?

37:27.250 --> 37:28.250
Yeah, we're good.

37:28.317 --> 37:30.184
Ok.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.617
What do you need?

37:31.684 --> 37:33.917
Ok, pull up the address
of the townhouse
that was vandalized.

37:33.983 --> 37:35.084
Got it.

37:35.150 --> 37:37.484
Ok. give me work permits
for the contractor.

37:38.451 --> 37:40.617
That would be...james morris.

37:40.684 --> 37:42.351
Is he our unsub?

37:42.417 --> 37:44.850
No, actually, i'm afraid
he's our first victim.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.484
Does it list morris'
subcontractors?

37:46.551 --> 37:47.718
Yes, it does.

37:47.784 --> 37:50.217
All right, i need
all the names
and addresses

37:50.284 --> 37:53.417
For whoever was hired
to do the electrical,
brickwork, and drywall.

37:53.484 --> 37:55.950
That would be
3 names, one address.

37:56.017 --> 37:58.351
So they do live together.

37:58.417 --> 38:00.617
Yeah. 5058 b street
near anacostia,

38:00.684 --> 38:03.250
Particulars coming
to you...now.

38:03.317 --> 38:05.117
Thanks, babe.

38:05.184 --> 38:06.351
We were right.

38:06.417 --> 38:08.850
They're a pack.

38:18.718 --> 38:19.784
We go in first.

38:19.850 --> 38:21.484
It's your case.

38:29.250 --> 38:30.451
Police!

38:30.517 --> 38:31.784
Fbi!

38:31.850 --> 38:33.517
Move!

38:34.751 --> 38:36.751
Get him down!

38:38.983 --> 38:40.117
Ow! ow!

38:40.184 --> 38:41.684
Where are the other two?

38:41.751 --> 38:43.684
You gotta be kidding me,
right?

38:43.751 --> 38:45.184
Dave.

38:45.250 --> 38:47.617
You like that, sir?

38:47.684 --> 38:50.084
I got more.

38:51.850 --> 38:54.017
Where are the others?

38:54.084 --> 38:55.517
Go to hell.

38:55.584 --> 38:57.818
Garcia, i need
vehicle information
on all the residents.

38:57.883 --> 38:59.617
Get him up.

39:01.784 --> 39:02.883
Got it.

39:02.950 --> 39:05.517
Apb--station wagon,

39:05.584 --> 39:07.983
D.c. plate
7-4-delta-alpha-4.

39:08.050 --> 39:11.351
I also need to know
if they're registered
on any jobs right now.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.184
I got a visual on
the station wagon

39:13.250 --> 39:16.184
Just south of 8th,
heading toward
half street, southeast.

39:16.250 --> 39:19.351
That's right next to
their current work site.

39:21.451 --> 39:23.150
You know what gets me?

39:23.217 --> 39:27.084
See, we figured you were
down and out, pissed off.

39:27.150 --> 39:29.150
But you're out here working.

39:29.217 --> 39:31.551
What is so god-awful
about your life

39:31.617 --> 39:34.684
That you gotta take it out
on the rest of the world?

39:34.751 --> 39:36.617
It was fun, boss.

39:36.684 --> 39:39.917
Deploy tactical units
922 half street, southeast.

39:39.983 --> 39:40.917
Thanks.

39:40.983 --> 39:42.983
We got 'em.

39:43.050 --> 39:45.217
Forget him, morgan.
he's nothing.

39:45.284 --> 39:47.451
Hotch: let's go.

39:49.917 --> 39:52.484
[sirens]

39:55.983 --> 39:58.584
[tires screeching]

40:02.950 --> 40:04.617
How many we got?

40:04.684 --> 40:06.617
[sirens]

40:06.684 --> 40:08.451
25, maybe 30.

40:08.517 --> 40:10.684
[tires screeching]

40:10.751 --> 40:12.517
That ought to do it.

40:16.784 --> 40:18.484
I got snipers up high,
i got a team around back.

40:18.551 --> 40:20.551
Once we're sure there's
not a hostage inside,

40:20.617 --> 40:21.950
I'll give the order
to breach.

40:24.983 --> 40:26.484
You leaving?

40:27.451 --> 40:29.317
You've got this under control.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.818
Is he just gonna
walk away?

40:38.883 --> 40:40.950
Looks like it.

40:43.651 --> 40:47.484
Just when i thought he was
back on top of his game.

40:47.551 --> 40:49.250
You got at least 2 dozen cops,

40:49.317 --> 40:51.317
All looking for revenge.

40:51.384 --> 40:53.784
You got two
psychopaths inside,

40:53.850 --> 40:56.917
Ready to play out
their fantasy end.

40:56.983 --> 40:59.417
You want to take
your shot...

40:59.484 --> 41:01.117
Take it.

41:02.818 --> 41:04.818
Our job is done.

41:09.584 --> 41:11.751
Is it time?

41:11.818 --> 41:13.784
What the hell, right?

41:13.850 --> 41:16.384
Just keep your head up
and you hold this
son of a bitch out front

41:16.451 --> 41:17.883
Like it's a gun.

41:25.751 --> 41:26.917
[gunfire]
