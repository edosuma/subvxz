15:47.947 --> 15:49.323
I had fun.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.409
And D.J. had fun. Right, Deej?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.494
Ah, it was okay.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.996
Fun. Big fun.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.877
So, it's up to you. Either you

15:57.624 --> 16:00.877
can feel sorry for yourself.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.921
Or you can feel bad

16:00.919 --> 16:02.921
for a little while

16:02.962 --> 16:06.466
and then shake it off and

16:02.962 --> 16:06.466
move on to the next fun thing.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.760
But I think I know

16:06.507 --> 16:08.760
what you're gonna do

16:08.802 --> 16:10.470
because you like

16:08.802 --> 16:10.470

16:10.511 --> 16:12.764

16:16.142 --> 16:17.560

16:17.602 --> 16:20.939
Well, it has to do with dad

16:17.602 --> 16:20.939
and a certain monster.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.233
- Uh-oh.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.233
- "Uh-oh" is right.

Hey, you look a little down.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.874
Look, I'm sorry if we wrecked

17:17.620 --> 17:20.874

No, it's not just

17:20.915 --> 17:23.125
Samantha, it's..

17:24.418 --> 17:26.086
Joseph, be honest with me.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.589
Doesn't living here

17:26.128 --> 17:28.589
get to you sometimes?

17:28.631 --> 17:30.466
- No.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.466
- Never?

17:30.508 --> 17:31.968
Never. I love it.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.970
You mean to tell me,

17:32.010 --> 17:33.970
you love changing diapers

17:34.012 --> 17:37.015
making school lunches, chasing

17:34.012 --> 17:37.015
the girls all around town

17:37.056 --> 17:39.017
changing diapers, helping them

17:37.056 --> 17:39.017
with their homework

17:39.058 --> 17:42.520
picking up their toys,

17:39.058 --> 17:42.520
did I mention changing diapers?

17:42.562 --> 17:45.565
Some of those tasks

17:42.562 --> 17:45.565
are more rewarding than others.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.359
Alright, why?

17:48.401 --> 17:51.195
Why, Joey,

17:48.401 --> 17:51.195
why are you happy here?

17:51.237 --> 17:54.365
Well, Jess, I think it's because

17:51.237 --> 17:54.365
when I was growing up

17:54.407 --> 17:55.825
I didn't have

17:54.407 --> 17:55.825
brothers and sisters.

17:55.867 --> 17:59.037
And I like being part

17:55.867 --> 17:59.037
of a big family.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.956
I like having people to care

17:59.078 --> 18:01.956
about, that includes you.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.500
Thank you.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.419
And besides, this is

18:04.542 --> 18:06.419
the only place I've ever lived

18:06.460 --> 18:10.506
that always

18:06.460 --> 18:10.506
has ice cream in the freezer.

18:10.548 --> 18:11.966
Pass.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.969
Joey, though..

18:15.011 --> 18:19.473
Don't you ever ask yourself,

18:15.011 --> 18:19.473
what am I doin'?

18:19.515 --> 18:22.560
I mean, I used to be

18:19.515 --> 18:22.560

18:22.602 --> 18:25.897

18:25.939 --> 18:28.482
And now..

18:28.524 --> 18:31.736
Now, it seems like

18:28.524 --> 18:31.736
I'm-I'm married or somethin'.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.821
I mean, I have all the

18:31.778 --> 18:33.821
responsibilities and hassles

18:33.863 --> 18:37.366
of three kids, yet I can't

18:33.863 --> 18:37.366
even deduct them from my taxes.

18:37.408 --> 18:40.578
Well, technically

18:37.408 --> 18:40.578
you could if you married Danny.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.748
Joey, do you realize

18:43.790 --> 18:46.166

18:43.790 --> 18:46.166
I sleep here, I sleep alone?

18:46.208 --> 18:48.086

18:49.670 --> 18:51.005
No, I don't..

18:51.047 --> 18:52.339

18:51.047 --> 18:52.339
here to you

18:52.381 --> 18:53.633
and you're

18:52.381 --> 18:53.633
making jokes.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.927
I know. I'm sorry.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.927
Alright, talk to me.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.305

18:59.346 --> 19:01.724

19:01.766 --> 19:03.517

19:01.766 --> 19:03.517
situation

19:03.559 --> 19:04.685
it's just gettin' to me.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.479
I mean, I have zero privacy.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.064
I-I-I try

19:06.520 --> 19:08.064
to write my music

19:08.106 --> 19:09.857
and I have all these

19:08.106 --> 19:09.857

19:09.899 --> 19:11.859
I-I write music,

19:09.899 --> 19:11.859
I write it out-out of

19:11.901 --> 19:14.654
my own life experiences,

19:11.901 --> 19:14.654
you know?

19:14.695 --> 19:16.864
My last three songs have been

19:14.695 --> 19:16.864
about changing diapers

19:16.906 --> 19:19.117
the measles

19:16.906 --> 19:19.117
and tub toys.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.370
I thought that tub toy song

19:20.534 --> 19:23.370
was very danceable.

19:25.623 --> 19:29.877
I just feel I have things to

19:25.623 --> 19:29.877
accomplish in my life, you know?

19:29.919 --> 19:31.378
I mean, there's things

19:29.919 --> 19:31.378
that I wanna do

19:31.420 --> 19:33.881
and there's things I wanna

19:31.420 --> 19:33.881
experience, and..

19:35.049 --> 19:36.717
I don't know, but maybe..

19:36.759 --> 19:39.637
Maybe livin' here

19:36.759 --> 19:39.637

19:41.180 --> 19:42.932

19:42.974 --> 19:45.726

19:47.227 --> 19:50.481
