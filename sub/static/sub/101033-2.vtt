Let's try and think positive.

10:45.095 --> 10:46.845
Come on.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.303
Something's wrong.
I can feel it.

11:03.261 --> 11:05.929
Maybe she's at home.
Now.

11:06.011 --> 11:07.428
Could be home,
could be anywhere.

11:07.512 --> 11:10.679
Bottom line is,
don't-don't trip, don't stress.

11:10.762 --> 11:13.178
You know, we're gonna
see what's what.

11:13.261 --> 11:14.595
Okay?

11:56.387 --> 11:57.762
Watch where you're going.

11:57.845 --> 11:59.178
Malaysia, how come you ain't
respond to my text?

11:59.261 --> 12:00.804
You ain't my man, bro.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.178
Look, it's an emergency.
I need to find Kiesha.

12:03.261 --> 12:05.178
I promise you,
I don't know where she at.

12:05.261 --> 12:06.762
And low-key,
I'm still mad at her anyway

12:06.845 --> 12:08.595
for sending me off
the other night,

12:08.679 --> 12:10.178
and she ain't responding
to my texts.

12:10.261 --> 12:11.720
She acting fool as fuck.

12:11.804 --> 12:14.261
Wait, so you ain't see her
Sunday night?

12:14.345 --> 12:15.679
Nah, but that don't mean shit.

12:15.762 --> 12:17.303
Kieshas can be sometime-y.

12:17.387 --> 12:18.428
You mean Kiesha?

12:18.512 --> 12:20.553
No, I mean Kieshas.

12:20.637 --> 12:22.595
Every Kiesha I met,
unreliable as hell.

12:24.595 --> 12:26.345
You got her boyfriend's number?

12:26.428 --> 12:28.512
Now, why would I have
her man's number in my phone?

12:28.595 --> 12:30.303
I ain't that type of bitch.

12:30.387 --> 12:32.970
You got his address?
Please, I need this address.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.136

- 'Cause something's wrong.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.053

we out.

but time.

17:45.845 --> 17:47.053
Did I ever tell you my pops

17:47.136 --> 17:48.595
used to work
in the mayor's office?

17:48.679 --> 17:50.387
No.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.261
He used to wash toilets.

17:54.178 --> 17:58.178
And he'd come home
with these rough, ashy hands.

18:00.428 --> 18:01.679
Kinda like mine.

18:01.762 --> 18:03.553
Yeah, they a struggle.

18:06.261 --> 18:07.679
Every day my pops came home,

18:07.762 --> 18:09.512
he would rub my hair
with those hands.

18:09.595 --> 18:12.011
♪ somber music ♪

18:12.095 --> 18:14.512
It was like we could feel
how hard he worked

18:14.595 --> 18:15.929
just by him touching us.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.303
It's funny,
but ever since I got back,

18:20.387 --> 18:22.720
I-I can't stop thinking
about him and those hands.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.387
I mean, we didn't have shit,
but...

18:28.470 --> 18:30.178
we were happy.

18:30.261 --> 18:31.970
We had each other.

18:33.679 --> 18:34.970
So what happened?

18:38.804 --> 18:40.387
Cabrini-Green happened.

18:43.095 --> 18:46.387
I mean, that place turned
into a war zone, and...

18:48.178 --> 18:49.345
...the Chicago
Housing Authority,

18:49.428 --> 18:51.470
they-they shut it down and...

18:51.553 --> 18:54.428
told everybody to leave,

18:54.512 --> 18:56.553
put us in temporary housing,

18:56.637 --> 18:58.053
promised to replace
the projects

18:58.136 --> 18:59.595
with brand-new condos
where we could all

18:59.679 --> 19:01.595
come back and live
happily ever after.

19:03.845 --> 19:06.929
Well, years went by, and...

19:07.011 --> 19:08.512
the condos were never built.

19:10.178 --> 19:14.762
So my pops, he went to work,
and he complained.

19:14.845 --> 19:17.303
He complained to the mayor?

19:17.387 --> 19:18.720
Yeah.

19:18.804 --> 19:20.679
And he fired him.

19:22.845 --> 19:26.053
He couldn't find work
for months.

19:26.136 --> 19:29.178
And after a while, he just...

19:29.261 --> 19:31.178
he just started to lose
that light in his eyes.

19:33.512 --> 19:36.011
And one day,

19:36.095 --> 19:38.512
he left and just
never came back.

19:42.053 --> 19:45.178
Then my moms got depressed.

19:45.261 --> 19:48.679
She started hanging out
with drug dealers.

19:48.762 --> 19:50.095
Then she got pregnant
with Reg,

19:50.178 --> 19:52.553
and by the time she had Jake,

19:52.637 --> 19:55.303
I was halfway out the door.

19:55.387 --> 19:58.679
When I got to Kankakee,
I-I couldn't find no work,

19:58.762 --> 20:00.720
so I started selling.

20:05.095 --> 20:07.470
Eventually, I found out that
Reg was running the streets.

20:09.887 --> 20:13.095
That's when I knew
Jake didn't stand a chance.

20:13.178 --> 20:14.845
I wasn't there
when he needed me.

20:16.053 --> 20:17.720
But I'm here now.

20:19.178 --> 20:21.178
Jake is the only blood
I got left.

20:24.428 --> 20:25.845
You need to go see him.

20:25.929 --> 20:28.053
And say what?

20:28.136 --> 20:30.345
That you're his brother
and you love him.

20:30.428 --> 20:31.845
That shit don't mean nothing.

20:31.929 --> 20:33.679
Well, it's gonna have to.

20:41.845 --> 20:44.011
I'm gonna go get dressed.

20:44.095 --> 20:45.845
You're taking me out.

20:47.887 --> 20:49.595

20:49.679 --> 20:51.929

20:59.220 --> 21:02.053

21:02.136 --> 21:04.178

you wasn't gonna come.

21:04.261 --> 21:05.887

23:00.095 --> 23:01.095
- Okay, I'll start.

23:01.178 --> 23:03.679
Um...I'm from Naperville.

23:03.762 --> 23:05.178
I own my own home.

23:05.261 --> 23:06.637
I have two cats.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.512
- I'm a Cubs fan.
- I hate cats.

23:08.595 --> 23:11.053
I mean,
they're cute and all,

23:11.136 --> 23:12.762
especially
when they're kittens,

23:12.845 --> 23:15.136
but they don't pull
their weight around the house.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.512
Dogs, on the other hand,
they guard.

23:17.595 --> 23:20.345
They-they help you with
exercise when you walk them.

23:20.428 --> 23:22.637
I mean, cats are just
spoiled brats.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.512
I mean, no disrespect,

23:24.595 --> 23:27.178
but that's why the Egyptians

23:27.261 --> 23:28.970
used to kill 'em
back in the day.

23:31.261 --> 23:32.929
- Mm-hmm.

23:33.011 --> 23:34.929
So what do you
like to do for fun?

23:35.011 --> 23:37.053
Mm, not much.

23:37.136 --> 23:38.762
Well, what about hobbies?

23:38.845 --> 23:40.053
Is sleeping a hobby?

23:40.136 --> 23:42.679
Nah, I don't think so.

23:42.762 --> 23:47.220
Ah, um, I like watching
movies on Lifetime.

23:47.303 --> 23:49.345
And I love hanging out
with my grandbabies.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.929
- You're a grandmother?
- Mm-hmm.

23:56.637 --> 23:58.720
You know,
if this were a contest,

23:58.804 --> 24:00.512
I'd be losing right now.

24:00.595 --> 24:03.178
You can't possibly
be doing worse than me.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.387
Um, this is probably TMI,

24:06.470 --> 24:08.637
but I haven't been
on a date in years,

24:08.720 --> 24:11.136
and I'm just looking
for somebody

24:11.220 --> 24:12.970
that doesn't have a record

24:13.053 --> 24:17.095
and knows better than to wear
gym socks with dress shoes.

24:17.178 --> 24:18.470
Is that too much to ask?

24:18.553 --> 24:20.553
It sounds
pretty reasonable to me.

24:20.637 --> 24:22.553
Huh.

24:22.637 --> 24:25.345
Well, before we get too deep,
I'm a grandmother,

24:25.428 --> 24:28.762
and I'm not good at texting.

24:28.845 --> 24:31.762
I don't have a problem
with either of those things.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.095
Great.

24:34.178 --> 24:37.637
So what part of Asia
are you from?

24:37.720 --> 24:39.387
I'm from Lincoln Park.

24:39.470 --> 24:41.178
Oh, my--I'm sorry.

24:41.261 --> 24:42.887
It's all good.

24:42.970 --> 24:44.845
What about your parents?
Where are they from?

24:46.345 --> 24:48.261
They're from Lincoln Park too.

24:49.178 --> 24:51.512
Wow.
Why am I so bad at this?

24:51.595 --> 24:53.053
It's all right.

24:53.136 --> 24:56.595
Just relax...and remember

24:56.679 --> 24:58.679
it's not a contest.

25:38.762 --> 25:42.762
Nigga...you homeless?

25:42.845 --> 25:44.387
Why you ain't say nothing?

25:45.470 --> 25:47.553
I actually like it here.

25:47.637 --> 25:49.845
You a lie and a half.

25:49.929 --> 25:51.845
I didn't like
the shit at first,

25:51.929 --> 25:55.470
but after a while,
I realized

25:55.553 --> 25:56.845
it's the first place
I actually feel like

25:56.929 --> 25:58.470
I'm a part of something.

25:58.553 --> 26:00.720
Yeah, part of
the homeless community.

26:04.261 --> 26:05.887
People here treat me
with respect.

26:07.679 --> 26:09.970
Bro, this shit
ain't healthy, G.

26:10.053 --> 26:11.804
Fuck this.
I got room in my crib.

26:11.887 --> 26:14.303
- Just stay with me.
- Yeah, me too.

26:14.387 --> 26:16.512
Yo, we could take turns, man.

26:16.595 --> 26:18.345
Y'all not listening.

26:18.428 --> 26:21.345
This where I belong.
I'm good.

26:25.679 --> 26:27.637
How you living, Ronnie?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.011
Hey, man, you or your friends
need a new phone,

26:29.095 --> 26:30.303
I'll cut you a deal, right?

26:30.387 --> 26:31.679
- All good, Pete.
- All right, man.

26:31.762 --> 26:32.512
All right.

26:32.595 --> 26:33.804
Hey, Ronnie,

26:33.887 --> 26:35.387
bunch of us
is playing craps later.

26:35.470 --> 26:38.345
- If you're free.
- Maybe later, Haze.

26:38.428 --> 26:39.845
Hey, Ronnie!

26:39.929 --> 26:41.387
What's up?
What's up? What's up?

26:41.470 --> 26:43.178
'Sup?

26:43.261 --> 26:44.637
That's my dog.

26:46.512 --> 26:48.095
All right, all right.

26:48.178 --> 26:50.345
There we go.

27:03.929 --> 27:05.845
Shit.

27:05.929 --> 27:07.804
- Coming.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.720
Hey.

27:15.804 --> 27:17.387
Hey, is Emmett here?

27:17.470 --> 27:18.887
No, but he'll be back
in an hour.

27:19.011 --> 27:20.887
Okay, good,
'cause I came to talk to you.

27:20.970 --> 27:23.512
Oh, shit,
what's-what's going on?

27:23.595 --> 27:26.011
I brought you some food.

27:26.095 --> 27:27.804
Where's that from?

27:27.887 --> 27:31.303
Uh, some chick who cook outta
her house on 51st and Ashland.

27:34.261 --> 27:37.095
So...what's going on?

27:38.261 --> 27:41.845
So...

27:41.929 --> 27:44.178
I did the speed dating
thing you told me about.

27:44.261 --> 27:46.220
Good!
How was it?

27:46.303 --> 27:47.637
Not great.

27:47.720 --> 27:50.428
What-what do you mean?
What happened?

27:50.512 --> 27:52.512
I-I'm just not good at it.

27:52.595 --> 27:54.095
What do you mean
you're not good at it?

27:54.178 --> 27:55.887
All you gotta do
is just flirt a little bit

27:55.970 --> 27:58.595
and don't tell them people
how many grandkids you got.

27:58.679 --> 28:01.970
So I said
all the wrong things.

28:02.053 --> 28:03.637
And on top of that,
everybody there

28:03.720 --> 28:06.136
was at least
ten years younger than me.

28:09.387 --> 28:12.679
I just want somebody
simple and easy.

28:12.762 --> 28:15.011
I don't need
all the bells and whistles.

28:15.095 --> 28:17.470
I just wanna go listen
to some decent jazz,

28:17.553 --> 28:19.762
take a trip to Jamaica
every now and then.

28:19.845 --> 28:21.387
That's it.

28:21.470 --> 28:23.804
Okay, can I keep it
100 with you?

28:23.887 --> 28:25.303
Please.

28:25.387 --> 28:27.303
You need somebody
to blow your back out.

28:27.387 --> 28:28.595
That sounds painful.

28:28.679 --> 28:31.011
It can be,
but in a good way.

28:31.095 --> 28:32.720
Okay?

28:36.136 --> 28:38.178
His name is Suede.

28:38.261 --> 28:40.136
He massages shit.

28:44.095 --> 28:47.303
I'm looking for a life partner,
not a masseuse.

28:47.387 --> 28:49.887
Well, until you find
a life partner, call him.

28:49.970 --> 28:51.720
Just don't tell Emmett
you got that from me.

28:51.804 --> 28:53.887
Ma?
What you doing here?

28:53.970 --> 28:55.095
Hey.

28:55.178 --> 28:57.011
Your mama don't need
an excuse to come over.

28:57.095 --> 28:58.804
I didn't say she did.

28:58.887 --> 29:00.679
What's wrong with you?
Hey.

29:00.762 --> 29:03.970
Mm, I got what I needed.

29:04.053 --> 29:06.178
I guess I'll
leave y'all to it.

29:06.261 --> 29:08.345
Yo, you wanna
watch EJ tonight?

29:08.428 --> 29:10.845
- No.
- Leave her alone.

29:10.929 --> 29:12.845
I'm just trying
to give you a break.

29:12.929 --> 29:15.512
How 'bout you give me a break
and feed him when he wakes up

29:15.595 --> 29:17.053
instead of expecting me
to do it?

29:17.136 --> 29:19.136
Okay, bye, y'all.

29:19.220 --> 29:20.845
- See ya.
- All right, love you.

29:22.303 --> 29:23.512
What you eating?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.428
Your mama
brought me some food.

29:25.512 --> 29:27.595
What about me?

29:27.679 --> 29:28.637
What about you?

29:28.720 --> 29:30.220
See, I can't get no respect.

29:30.303 --> 29:32.303
Boy, here, shut up.

29:34.512 --> 29:36.470
Damn.
Who made this?

29:36.553 --> 29:38.220
Some chick.
Hmm.

29:38.303 --> 29:39.970
What's her number?

29:40.053 --> 29:42.720
What you want
the bitch number for?

29:42.804 --> 29:45.053
Not like that.
I'm trying to hire her.

29:45.136 --> 29:46.220
For what, Emmett?

29:46.303 --> 29:48.095
To come cook for me.

29:49.345 --> 29:51.720
Oh, well, that's smart.

29:51.804 --> 29:54.178
See, I be having
good ideas sometimes.

29:54.261 --> 29:56.679
You be having good ideas
all the time.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.303
You know words of affirmation
is my love language.

30:00.387 --> 30:03.637
And you know
physical touch...is mine.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.178
Oh, I know that.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.970
After I finish eating.

30:07.053 --> 30:08.720
Oh, I'll touch your body
