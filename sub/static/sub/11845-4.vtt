14:08.514 --> 14:13.645
Like brothers.
No secrets between us.

14:13.719 --> 14:16.552
And now I find out he had this whole family
he never even told me about?

14:16.622 --> 14:20.217
- Shh!
- I'm only a distant cousin.

14:26.398 --> 14:28.833
Do you have representation?

14:28.901 --> 14:31.268
- Do I--
- Agent. Do you have an agent?

14:31.337 --> 14:33.066
Please!

14:33.138 --> 14:36.267

Okay. We'll talk after.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.526
Fine. Action.

14:56.595 --> 14:59.394
In my hand, I hold a billing statement
for the Sunrise Retirement Facility...

14:59.465 --> 15:01.365
my grandfather's nursing home.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.869
The exorbitant cost,
over $1,200 a month.

15:04.937 --> 15:08.567
Outrageous, considering
the substandard care he's receiving.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.700
Hey, guys.
Filming something?

15:10.776 --> 15:14.610
Cut! Dad, you just ruined the shot.
You ruined the shot.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.149
I'm just grabbing a beer.

15:20.486 --> 15:23.512
- How was your gig?
- It was great.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.081
The Kit Shickers
are really coming together.

15:26.158 --> 15:31.158
Hey, uh, listen. Did you take care
of that little thing we talked about?

15:31.864 --> 15:31.887
Hey, uh, listen. Did you take care
of that little thing we talked about?

15:33.265 --> 15:35.461
- Yeah.
- Good.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.466
That's it?

15:42.541 --> 15:44.669
Ask him about what
your grandfather said.

15:44.743 --> 15:46.734
He's not gonna talk about it.

15:46.812 --> 15:49.406
Well, let's find out.

15:52.084 --> 15:56.180
Hey, am I supposed to smile
or wave or something?

15:56.255 --> 15:58.690
<i>[ Liz] Uh, actually
it's for a school project.</i>

15:58.757 --> 16:00.816
<i>Our assignment is to “get the truth"

16:00.893 --> 16:03.828
Hey, if you want, you could
come down and film the band.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.922
We're musicians. Musicians
are always searching for the truth.

16:06.999 --> 16:11.800
<i>Well, actually, I was a little bit
more interested in you and your father.</i>

16:19.077 --> 16:22.672
- It hasn't been that long.
- [Kyle] 0h, yes, it <i>has.</i>

16:22.748 --> 16:27.652
September 24, 2000.
Grandpa has it marked on his calendar.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.819
Turn that thing off.
Turn that off!

16:32.891 --> 16:36.020
Who the hell did that?
It wasn't him.

16:36.094 --> 16:38.961
- Was it somebody at the nursing home,
interfering in our- - I marked it down, okay?

16:39.031 --> 16:41.966
- Why?
- Because it makes him happy.

16:42.034 --> 16:45.698
Kyle, I don't think he even knows
who we are anymore.

16:47.472 --> 16:49.463
He said something to me today.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.244
He spoke to you?

16:53.312 --> 16:56.441
Actually, he grabbed me
and then he said something.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.418
- What?
- “They are among us.“

17:00.485 --> 17:03.045
Do you have any idea
what that would-

17:03.121 --> 17:05.646
“They are among us“?

17:05.723 --> 17:11.595
FheyAreAmong Us is a <i>“</i> B“ movie
that was shot here in Roswell back in the '50s.

17:11.663 --> 17:15.292
It's just a painful memory rattling
around in an old man's brain.

17:15.367 --> 17:20.134
- Why is that a painful memory? - The leading lady
in the film was killed during the production.

17:20.204 --> 17:24.164
My father was the sheriff at the time,
so he headed up the investigation.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.676
- I told you about all this.
- No. You never talk about Grandpa.

17:26.744 --> 17:32.149
Anyway, my father was convinced
that she was killed by an alien...

17:32.217 --> 17:35.118
but she wasn't.

17:35.187 --> 17:38.521
She died of a-
a freak lightning strike.

<i>[ Isabel]

- Of course it was, Isabel.

18:08.854 --> 18:13.451

18:13.525 --> 18:16.187
It wasn't Max. I swear.

Oh. Well...

for three weeks...

18:26.104 --> 18:30.234
that he mightjust wanna
check in once in a while.

18:30.308 --> 18:31.833
- Don't you think?
- Mom?

18:31.910 --> 18:35.710
- I mean,you talk to him, right?
- Sure.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.250
Does he need money?

18:38.316 --> 18:41.752
I don't think so.

<i>Michael and I disapprove of you wandering

<i>You could expose us or even get yourself

<i>Finding your son.

19:36.074 --> 19:39.044
<i>But do you even
have a plan, Max?</i>

19:39.111 --> 19:41.239
<i>Yes, I have a plan.</i>

19:41.313 --> 19:44.374
- <i>Well, sort of a plan. I'm getting an agent</i>
- <i>What?</i>

19:44.449 --> 19:48.579
Hit man, thug, convict, tough guy.
joey Ferrini could play'em all.

19:48.653 --> 19:50.883
So Ferrini wasn't
reallya hit man?

19:50.956 --> 19:52.947
Oh, well-

19:56.161 --> 19:58.391
- Enjoy.
- Not recently.

19:58.463 --> 20:00.625
So what wasjoey in prison for?

20:00.699 --> 20:05.068
You know, you really don't know
very much about your cousin.

20:05.137 --> 20:08.903
He was my second cousin,
twice removed.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.743
Assault.
He was big on assault.

20:12.811 --> 20:16.179
Loved assaulting people.
Which is why he's so convincing on screen.

20:16.248 --> 20:19.616
- Uh,joey called me a couple of
weeks ago from Utah. - Yeah?

20:19.684 --> 20:23.712
- Do you know what he was doing there?
- I didn't book that job.

20:23.788 --> 20:27.247
I gotta be straight with you.
And I don't mean to disrespect the dead...

20:27.325 --> 20:31.262
but your cousinjoey
was not a great actor.

20:31.329 --> 20:36.768
Now, you on the other hand, you, my friend,
you are on a completely different path.

20:36.835 --> 20:41.295
Let's talkTom Cruise.
Let's talk Keanu Reeves.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.467
I'm not an actor.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.273
What, and Keanu Reeves is?

20:46.344 --> 20:48.335
All you need is exposure.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.848
That's the last thing I need.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.546
Oh, oh, look, look,
look, look, look, look!

20:54.619 --> 20:58.522
<i>- [Max] Who's that?
- Who's that? What, are you from Kansas?</i>

21:00.091 --> 21:03.391
Of course. That's why I love you.
That is Kal Langley.

21:03.461 --> 21:07.329
He is just the biggest, the most
powerful producer in this whole town.

21:07.399 --> 21:11.393

your name in his brain.

Hello?

21:46.738 --> 21:48.672
<i>I think I've found something.</i>

21:48.740 --> 21:52.267
I think the shape-shifter killed
someone here in Roswell in 1959.

21:52.344 --> 21:55.871
- What do you mean?
- You're chasing a serial killer, Max.

21:55.947 --> 21:58.609
Look, an actress was killed
on a movie location.

21:58.683 --> 22:01.744
The coroner said that she died
of a freak lightning strike.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.618
Coincidence?

22:03.688 --> 22:06.680
In Roswell,
there are no coincidences.

22:06.758 --> 22:11.025
Valenti's dad was sheriff. He knew that it was
alien-related, but nobody believed him.

22:11.096 --> 22:14.930
- Did he have any suspects?
- I don't know. But I'll find out.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.300
Thanks, Liz.
Thank you for helping me.

22:18.370 --> 22:23.274
Yeah, well, you know, the sooner you find
this guy, the sooner you come home.

22:23.341 --> 22:26.242
Look, my dad's coming.

23:59.471 --> 24:01.667
The cops said
he was hit by lightning.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.232
Well, the cops are wrong.
He was murdered.

24:08.713 --> 24:10.841
You know I'm right, don't you?

24:10.915 --> 24:13.885
I tried telling them,
but they wouldn't believe me.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.886
They thought I was crazy.

You're not crazy.

- <i>[Loud Whooshing]</i>

25:05.737 --> 25:08.468
- And thenjoey was dead.
- You said you saw someone?

25:10.708 --> 25:13.405
Yeah,yeah, a man.
There was something weird about him.

25:13.478 --> 25:16.004
- <i>It'; like he was glowing.</i>
- <i>And</i> what <i>did he look like?</i>

25:16.080 --> 25:20.278
- I didn't really get a good look at him.
- Hair color, clothes, anything?

25:20.351 --> 25:25.517
I'm sorry. You know, he went off that way
and seemed to just disappear.

25:25.590 --> 25:30.653
I saw that video of joey
rehearsing for his role up in Utah.

who cast him?

25:33.431 --> 25:35.365

I told him he was losing it,
so he stopped talking to me about it.

He just said that he got
the goods on someone.

I was just so excited to get your call.
How did you find me?

26:24.048 --> 26:27.484
We got your name off one of those
film history Web sites. Right here.

It said that you did hair and makeup
on TheyAre Among Us.

26:32.323 --> 26:34.052
- Oh,just loved it.
- It's my favorite.

27:11.996 --> 27:13.930
Yes. Poor thing.

He caused quite a stir
with that whole alien business.

27:17.535 --> 27:20.095
Do you remember

27:20.171 --> 27:23.766
<i>Anyone that he might have
accused of being an alien?</i>

27:23.841 --> 27:26.276
Sure. He thought
it was the clapper loader.

27:28.012 --> 27:29.980
What's a clapper loader?

27:30.048 --> 27:33.211
He's the guy who bangs the thing,

- [ Max] Oh.
- Who are you with?

27:37.455 --> 27:40.322

27:46.731 --> 27:49.098
We're getting off the subject.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.560
Okay, um...

27:52.637 --> 27:55.402
well, here's the theory.

27:55.473 --> 27:57.601
If the clapper loader
is the shape-shifter...

27:57.675 --> 28:00.110
then I'm thinking that
maybe that's his base form.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.772
- The body he always goes back to.
- Right.

28:02.847 --> 28:07.808
And if that's true, maybe if we can find out
what this clapper loader looked like in 1959--

28:07.885 --> 28:11.116
- He might still look like that today.
- Exactly.

28:11.189 --> 28:14.489
Okay. So how do we find out
what this guy looked like?

28:14.559 --> 28:16.687
Well, he'll be on all the film.
He's not in the actual movie...

28:16.761 --> 28:18.695
but he'll be in all the dailies.

28:18.763 --> 28:22.757
- What <i>are dailies?</i>
- <i>Dailies are all the footage theyshoot in one day.</i>

28:22.834 --> 28:26.134
You know, like outtakes, bloopers,
alternate angles, that stuff.

28:26.204 --> 28:31.267
- Thanks.
- I'm really glad that she's so helpful.

28:31.342 --> 28:34.175
So how do we get ahold
of 50-year-old dailies?

28:34.245 --> 28:37.738
I did some research, and I found out
that the rights to fheyAreAmong <i>Us...</i>

28:37.815 --> 28:39.749
were eventually sold
to Paramount Pictures.

28:39.817 --> 28:42.184
So all of their dailies
should be in their film vaults.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.381
God, I love you.

28:44.455 --> 28:48.892
- Well, did she hear that?
- Definitely.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.624

- Uh, thanks, but-

29:10.948 --> 29:13.713
- Ah, it was worth a shot.
- Bunny.

29:15.353 --> 29:17.651

about all this.

29:17.722 --> 29:21.386

the right time, you know.

the right time because it is really good news.
