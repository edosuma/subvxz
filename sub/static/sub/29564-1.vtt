01:50.632 --> 01:52.938
ELI: It's hard
to fend off the dark.

01:52.982 --> 01:55.724
Especially what hides
within it.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.814
I see it sometimes
out of the corner
of my eye.

01:58.857 --> 02:02.209
Hear its footsteps,
one behind mine.

02:02.252 --> 02:05.212
I feel it every time
I turn off the lights.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.826
My fear only
makes it stronger.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.612
I know what it is.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.527
It's evil.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.834
And the evil I know
has a name.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.620
The Burghly Monster.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.014
The Burglary what?

02:26.058 --> 02:27.669
The Burghly Monster.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.411
He collects kids' souls,
and he's after mine.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.587
If he gets my soul,

02:34.980 --> 02:36.939
then he might
come after one of you.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.465
So if I don't show up
for school one day,

02:41.509 --> 02:43.815
-you'll know that
the Burghly Monster got me.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.644
MISS PERRY: Yes, Hillary.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.690
I think I need
to go to the bathroom.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.735
-MISS PERRY: You may
be excused.

02:50.779 --> 02:54.348
Eli, put your drawings
on my desk.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.789
-GIRLS: You go first,
I go last.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.574
Tell my ears anything.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.490
-Unicorn.
-Puppy.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.840
-Cat.
-Dog.

03:20.548 --> 03:21.853
BOY: Hurry, I'm coming.

03:25.509 --> 03:26.510
Whoo-hoo!

03:36.694 --> 03:38.566
-Bug.
-Bat.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.569
-Marmot.
-Owl.

03:41.612 --> 03:45.877
CHILDREN:
Ashes, ashes,
we all fall down!

03:45.921 --> 03:49.185
Hey, Eli, what the hell
were you thinking?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.710
Emily said that if I warned
everybody about
the Burghly Monster,

03:52.754 --> 03:55.757
he might leave me alone
and go after someone else.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.020
Dude, it was
show and tell.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.500
It doesn't have to
be so heavy.

03:59.543 --> 04:02.067
Emily is clearly
making it up.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.243
Just think about it.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.201
The Burghly Monster.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.247
That's a super lame name
for a monster.

04:07.595 --> 04:08.639
Come on.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.206
ELI: Sam, the name's
not important.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.642
I felt him.

04:11.686 --> 04:12.948
He hides
behind the furnace

04:12.991 --> 04:14.863
and uses the vents
to get around the house.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.430
He watches me.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.953
I think he's after my soul.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.694
SAM: Dude, you got issues.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.304
ELI: He's real.

04:23.219 --> 04:25.221
So, what time's your mom
picking us up?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.528
She and my dad are in
with Miss Perry.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.921
Oh, man. You can kiss
your weekends goodbye.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.887
We appreciate your concern,
Miss Perry.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.672
To be honest,
I still don't know
what the big deal is.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.675
So he told a ghost story,
and a little girl
crapped her pants?

04:46.938 --> 04:48.636
The big deal,
Mr. Braverman,

04:48.679 --> 04:52.422
is that Eli felt the need
to tell myself
and the entire class

04:52.466 --> 04:56.470
that he's being stalked
by something "evil"
in your basement.

04:56.513 --> 04:59.821
Now, these
subconscious associations

04:59.864 --> 05:02.258
are usually indicative
of a bigger problem.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.347
But there haven't been
any problems
for a long time.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.393
Hmm.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.916
Are there any
issues at home?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.353
With the marriage?

05:12.181 --> 05:15.184
Perhaps it's a result
of the change in medication.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.363
I mean no disrespect,
Mr. and Mrs. Braverman...

05:20.407 --> 05:23.671
RICHARD: Listen,
he's starting to feel
like himself again.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.281
We took him off the meds,

05:25.325 --> 05:27.718
because we don't think
he's got BPD
in the first place.

05:27.762 --> 05:31.287
I mean, these aren't
some kind of subconscious
manifestations.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.159
There's real talent here.
We should be
encouraging this.

05:34.203 --> 05:35.987
I'm not denying
his talent, Mr. Braverman,

05:36.031 --> 05:37.989
but that could
be the problem.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.949
Eli may be seeking refuge
in his imagination.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.995
It might be a good time
for a clinical reevaluation.

05:44.039 --> 05:46.215
I can set up an appointment
with the school therapist.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.087
Oh, we... You mean,
you're not accredited?

05:49.131 --> 05:50.785
RICHARD:
That won't be necessary.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.875
All right?
We'll monitor his TV,
we'll watch what he eats.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.267
Limit the sugar.
All right?

05:55.311 --> 05:56.573
This won't happen again.

05:56.617 --> 05:59.097
These kinds of drawings
cannot be taken lightly.

05:59.141 --> 06:03.232
I feel they are indicative
of one of two things.

06:03.275 --> 06:08.411
Either Eli is working
through some traumatic
childhood event,

06:08.455 --> 06:10.457
or you have a monster
living in your basement.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.417
ELI: Yeah, that's the Matrix
of Leadership.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.898
If you take that out,
he's just Hot Rod.

06:16.941 --> 06:20.510
But if you leave it in,
he becomes Rodimus Prime.

06:20.554 --> 06:21.903
-Take it out?
-No. No.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.295
We gotta keep it in.

06:23.339 --> 06:26.342
This guy is, like,
a super awesome
Transformer.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.517
Like the best
I've ever seen.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.563
He just seems boring.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.521
ELI: What do you mean?
HILLARY: Hey, guys!

06:31.565 --> 06:33.175
Hey, dude,
your girlfriend's coming.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.524
She's not my girlfriend.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.570
Fine, your stalker's coming.

06:38.876 --> 06:41.226
-Hi, Eli.
-ELI: Hey, Hillary.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.054
Eli, I believe you.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.753
I think
the Burghly Monster's
after me, too.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.973
I don't know.
How could he be after both
of us at the same time?

06:49.017 --> 06:50.322
He's a monster, Eli.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.846
He doesn't have rules.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.065
I've been hearing
strange noises
under my bed

06:54.109 --> 06:55.937
and having trouble
breathing at night.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.069
Do you keep your lights on?
He's afraid of the light.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.245
No. My mom won't let me.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.030
But I found a way
to stay safe.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.945
I recite the same prayer
every night.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.037
Now I lay me
down to sleep,

07:09.080 --> 07:11.431
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.216
If I die before I wake,

07:14.259 --> 07:16.566
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.090
If you say that every night
before you go to bed,

07:19.134 --> 07:20.570
then nothing can get you.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.007
Thanks, Hillary.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.236
-SAM: Hi, Mr.
and Mrs. Braverman.
-Hi, Sam. Hey, bud.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.804
Hi, Mom. Hey, Dad.

07:36.847 --> 07:40.677
Hey, Sam, did you have
anything to do with this?

07:40.721 --> 07:42.940
No, Mr. Braverman.
Not this one. I swear.

07:45.377 --> 07:48.511
-Eli?
-I don't want to
talk about it.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.992
RICHARD: I thought
we were done with all
the Burghly Monster business.

07:51.688 --> 07:52.863
We are.

07:52.907 --> 07:55.300
Then why would you
curse the entire class?

07:56.998 --> 07:58.826
Mr. Braverman,
it was Emily.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.480
She tricked him
into doing it.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.049
-Eli, is that true?
-Yeah.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.314
Some of these
are worth framing.

08:09.358 --> 08:10.664
Hold onto them, okay?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.492
All right, boys,

08:13.754 --> 08:16.191
what do you say we blow
this popsicle stand?

08:17.627 --> 08:19.673
Nobody says that anymore,
Mr. Braverman.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.242
LIZ: What time is your mom
picking you up again?

08:24.286 --> 08:25.940
SAM: I think
she said around 6:00.

08:25.983 --> 08:28.551
ELI: That's not a lot of time.
We've got to get going.
Come on!

08:28.595 --> 08:29.900
We'll be in my workshop.

08:31.685 --> 08:34.731
-He seems okay to me.
-She's out of control.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.690
She's just
concerned about Eli.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.953
No.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.564
Are we afraid
to call her by name now?

08:41.608 --> 08:43.610
The only evil
possessing this house

08:43.653 --> 08:46.090
is in the form of
that 16-year-old girl.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.005
Evil?

08:48.049 --> 08:50.573
Emily is not
the only one to blame here.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.053
-You are, too.
-Me?

08:52.096 --> 08:53.968
Yes, you.
It's your dumb story.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.317
The Burghly Monster.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.449
It was a dumb story,

08:57.493 --> 08:59.147
but I didn't
tell it to him.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.844
Besides,
she's your daughter, too.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.411
Mmm.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.587
I'd like to see them
run the tests
on that one again.

She's in the shower,
we got like 20 minutes.
Quick, sign in.

ELI: No, you do it.
SAM: Don't be a chicken.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.160
You're a dead man.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.119
ELI: I'm already dead.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.295
Yeah, but I don't want this

12:55.775 --> 12:57.689
Are you sure
it was worth it?

Totally. Emily's a bitch.

12:59.866 --> 13:00.997
-Hey, look!

13:01.041 --> 13:03.434
We already got one view,
and a comment!

13:03.478 --> 13:05.654
ELI: Sweet!

13:05.697 --> 13:08.962
Are you kidding me?
She's totally
stalking you, bro.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.488
SAM: I gotta go.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.185
Wanna Facechat later?

13:15.229 --> 13:17.231
Can't. Mom's got me
on lockdown.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.754
Again?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.235
I told you how to
clear your browser.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.585
What can I say?
I like boobies.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.239
-Walkies?
-Sure.

13:27.415 --> 13:28.720
Tell your parents
I said bye.

Hey, Eli!

13:35.423 --> 13:36.641
Peace out.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.068
Coming!

14:18.466 --> 14:20.120
LIZ: You're gonna screw up
your calorie count.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.774
RICHARD: Fifty sit-ups,
and it'll be like
it never happened.

turn that off, please?

14:26.126 --> 14:27.910
RICHARD: Yeah, buddy.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.043
You gotta come back
to the real world from
time to time. Come on.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.481
EMILY: You are an animal!

14:33.524 --> 14:35.700
A disgusting little pig!

14:35.744 --> 14:37.441
-RICHARD: Hey!
-Look what he did!

14:38.486 --> 14:39.574
He's a little pervert.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.097
He put this on the web!

14:41.141 --> 14:42.272
All of my friends
are going to see it.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.839
I'm gonna have to
be home-schooled.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.015
RICHARD: Okay,
relax with the drama.
Let me see.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.980
I... There's only
five hits on this.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.939
He tagged it,
"Sister Gone Wild."

14:56.983 --> 14:59.594
If that goes viral,
the whole world
is going to see it.

14:59.637 --> 15:02.553
-Oh, God!
-Take it down!

15:08.429 --> 15:09.821
-Mom!
-Enough.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.737
All right, Eli,
take it down.

15:20.310 --> 15:23.400
-There. It's gone.

15:23.444 --> 15:26.751
No computers, no video games,
nothing digital for a month.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.492
That's not fair!

15:28.536 --> 15:30.842
Don't look at me, bud.
I can't help you out
with this one.

15:30.886 --> 15:34.716
That's it? A few weeks
without video games?
Are you kidding me?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.720
Don't let them fool you.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.333
You're not normal.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.856
RICHARD AND LIZ: Emily!

15:44.900 --> 15:45.988
You never will be.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.033
Emily!

15:47.076 --> 15:49.426
Look at me. Get upstairs.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.602
Truth hurts.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.692
Yeah, it's gonna hurt worse.
Get upstairs. This is mine.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.307
Christ.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.135
You all right, big guy?

16:02.178 --> 16:03.484
You know she didn't mean it.

16:03.527 --> 16:04.528
Yes, she did.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.661
No, she didn't. She's...

16:07.401 --> 16:08.968
She's just being Emily.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.970
You know you can't
antagonize her like that.

16:11.013 --> 16:15.365
But she tricked me into
telling the whole class
about the Burghly Monster.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.808
-RICHARD: You know what?
-What?

16:25.723 --> 16:28.639
You're right.
This is a really
scary basement.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.381
Maybe I should finish it.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.298
Reminds me of
the basement I grew up in
when I was a kid.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.953
-And guess what.
-What?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.912
I thought the Burghly Monster
lived in my basement, too.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.004
I know. Emily told me.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.483
And now he's after me.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.311
Emily said that
just to scare you.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.096
Like your Uncle Kevin
and Uncle Gary.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.923
They made him up
to scare me.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.622
I don't even know
where they came up
with that stupid name.

16:54.665 --> 16:58.756
Dad, the Burghly Monster
did come after you.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.498
No, he didn't, buddy.
I'm sorry.

17:01.542 --> 17:04.675
That was a story I told Emily
just to get her to behave.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.417
It's not real.

17:07.461 --> 17:10.072
He's real. I can feel him.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.640
When I turn off the lights,
it's like I've opened
a door for him.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.294
Calm down.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.209
Okay? Take a deep breath.

17:20.778 --> 17:21.823
All right.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.259
Do you really think
there's anything

17:23.303 --> 17:25.566
that I wouldn't do
to protect you?

17:25.609 --> 17:28.569
I will turn on
every light in this house.

17:28.612 --> 17:31.876
I will go put giant floodlights
out in the front lawn,

17:31.920 --> 17:33.835
and I'll point them
in every direction.

17:33.878 --> 17:34.879
But you know what?

17:35.924 --> 17:37.926
That's not going
to stop the fear.

17:40.146 --> 17:44.846
So, let's say that there is
a Burghly Monster, big deal.

17:44.889 --> 17:48.937
The only thing you need to
be concerned with is the light
you have inside you.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.199
Right here.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.640
Wow. Your light is strong.

17:58.729 --> 17:59.948
How do you know?

18:01.210 --> 18:02.516
'Cause I'm your dad.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.520
Does everyone
have this light?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.130
Yeah.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.436
Even Emily?

18:09.479 --> 18:13.135
Yeah, hers just isn't
that bright right now.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.095
I'll tell you what,
we're going to test
this out. Okay?

18:16.138 --> 18:19.837
I want you to stay right here,
and we are going
to count to 10.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.100
No, Dad.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.015
-Yes, it's just 10 seconds.
- No.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.235
Okay? I'm going to be
at the top of the stairs,
waiting.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.063
Okay?

18:29.195 --> 18:30.413
Okay.

18:30.457 --> 18:31.501
You can do this.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.769
Remember, buddy,
you're a Braverman.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.078
ELI: One...

18:47.213 --> 18:48.388
two...

18:59.050 --> 19:00.051
three...

19:13.239 --> 19:14.457
four...

19:16.807 --> 19:18.200
five...

19:22.248 --> 19:23.553
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.278
What's going on, buddy?

20:36.322 --> 20:38.802
Can I watch TV
with you guys?

20:38.846 --> 20:42.676
I'm sorry. I won't even watch,
I'll just sit in the room.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.112
You know, to be fair,

20:44.155 --> 20:46.723
the sentence should
officially commence tomorrow,

20:46.767 --> 20:49.248
seeing that it happened
so late in the day today.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.380
Who are you, his attorney?

20:52.076 --> 20:53.164
Please?

20:53.208 --> 20:55.819
No talking. No snacks.
Bed by 11:00.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.387
Deal.

21:08.963 --> 21:12.445
LIZ: Only one kernel.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.098
WEATHERMAN ON TV:
Seventy-two degrees
was the high today.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.057
That's about average
for this time of year.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.102
Now, as we look
to our satellite,

21:18.146 --> 21:21.497
you can see we're in
for some late night storm
activity tomorrow night.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.282
For all you sky watchers
out there,

21:23.325 --> 21:27.329
NASA's warning of
some light solar flare
activity this weekend.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.722
Now, depending on
the cloud cover,

21:28.765 --> 21:31.333
that should make for
a spectacular light show.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.336
There is a small chance
they could disrupt
satellite communications

21:34.380 --> 21:36.512
and cause small
power fluctuations,

21:36.556 --> 21:38.297
so keep your
flashlights handy.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.517
We'll be back with
your seven-day forecast
after this.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.824
If you switch to
OxiClean spray,

21:43.867 --> 21:46.957
the power of oxygen
makes tough stains
disappear on contact.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.612
On red wine,
chocolate ice cream,
even blueberry.

21:49.656 --> 21:51.353
It works better
than the leading spray.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.790
For a limited time,
get 46% more free.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.227
OxiClean gets
the tough stains out.

22:06.629 --> 22:07.717
Sweet dreams, buddy.

23:29.233 --> 23:33.716
My light is strong.
My light is strong.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.416
My light is strong.
My light is strong.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.244
My light is strong.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.117
My light is strong.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.594
Help! Help!

25:08.637 --> 25:11.335
-Help! Help!
-Get off of him!

25:11.379 --> 25:12.423
Stop! It's me!

25:12.467 --> 25:14.382
Emily! What the hell
are you doing?

25:14.425 --> 25:17.341
Taking away his video games
isn't going to teach him

25:17.385 --> 25:18.560
to leave me alone!

25:18.952 --> 25:20.344
This will!

25:23.957 --> 25:26.307
You forgot to
leave the lights on.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.178
RICHARD:
I know. I'm sorry.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.616
You're okay.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.619
You're okay.

25:37.492 --> 25:40.495
Are you purposely trying
to scar him for life?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.584
That was
borderline psychotic.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.281
So was what he did to me.

25:44.325 --> 25:47.154
I feel violated.
Then to see that
posted online.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.069
Oh, stop. It was
an innocent prank.

25:49.939 --> 25:51.550
It wasn't that innocent.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.641
I agree. He had no right
to record you,

25:55.684 --> 25:58.121
but he's
your little brother.

25:58.165 --> 26:00.428
You know how much he's
been through this past year.

26:05.215 --> 26:08.741
You're right.
I went too far.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.786
I'll take him out
for ice cream
and apologize.

26:12.309 --> 26:13.397
That would be nice.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.183
Just do me a favor.

26:16.226 --> 26:19.186
When you're done,
leave the lights on.

27:03.056 --> 27:05.188
Facebook's up $10.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.625
I should have bought in
when you told me to.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.978
-What is that?
-What?

27:12.500 --> 27:13.501
That.

27:14.458 --> 27:15.895
Hand over the iPad.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.725
When you're
done with breakfast,
go grab the rest.

27:21.901 --> 27:24.555
Hi, Mrs. Braverman.
Can Eli come out and play?

27:24.599 --> 27:27.036
Sam! How did you get here?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.386
SAM: I rode my bike.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.301
That's a really long ride.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.564
Eh. It wasn't too bad.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.044
Does your mom
know you're here?

27:35.088 --> 27:36.655
She's still sleeping.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.613
She had a late
work night last night.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.397
Ah. Okay.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.486
Well, we'll call her
in a little bit,
let her know you're here.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.054
Eli, guess who's here.

27:45.359 --> 27:46.360
Sam!

27:47.840 --> 27:50.233
Sam. You'll never believe
what happened.

27:50.277 --> 27:52.801
Hold up, everyone.
You are supposed
to be grounded.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.107
Come on, Mom.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.415
Have you eaten
anything yet?

27:58.459 --> 27:59.460
Uh, a little.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.897
Kitchen. You, shower.

28:02.637 --> 28:03.899
ELI: Come on.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.119
I found this video on how
to make ectoplasm.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.250
Great.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.370
Hey, at least
clear my browser.

28:43.634 --> 28:44.635
Oh.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.682
Oh, no.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.902
She knows where you live.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.426
She's not that bad.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.514
What?

28:55.516 --> 28:57.692
-Hey, Hillary.
-HILLARY: Eli, are you okay?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.128
ELI: Yeah.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.565
I think the Burghly Monster
came for me last night.

29:01.609 --> 29:04.960
Hillary, you can't just
pretend to see something
just to be my friend.

29:05.004 --> 29:07.615
I'm not pretending.
I have proof.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.183
Here, read these.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.794
I think the Burghly Monster
was a real man.

29:12.838 --> 29:18.104
"A lumber baron heir,
R.L. Burghly was arrested
late last night

29:18.147 --> 29:20.106
"after mounds
of charred limbs

29:20.149 --> 29:22.673
"were discovered
in the furnace
of Burghly Lumber."

29:24.023 --> 29:25.372
Read the next one.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.420
"The charred body
of R.L. Burghly

29:30.464 --> 29:32.901
"was found in his cell
New Year's Day.

29:32.945 --> 29:35.730
"The prison guards
could not identify
the source of the fire."

29:37.558 --> 29:41.214
SAM:
Analysis complete.
You're both crazy.

29:41.257 --> 29:43.912
Sam, you gotta listen.
This is serious.

29:43.956 --> 29:46.523
Burghly Lumber
used to be here
in West Bloomfield.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.830
It was turned into
a huge nursery.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.789
I think that's where
it all started.

29:52.834 --> 29:56.707
I gotta go.
My mom's waiting. Bye.

29:58.144 --> 30:00.233
SAM: Man, and I thought
you had issues.

30:02.322 --> 30:04.498
ELI: We've gotta
go check this out.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.152
I thought he lived
in your basement?

30:06.195 --> 30:08.284
Sam, this could
be a source.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.896
A source of what?

30:19.252 --> 30:21.341
SAM: You know
this is crazy, right?

30:21.384 --> 30:23.256
Emily's behind all of it.

30:23.299 --> 30:26.346
ELI: I'm not crazy.
There's something
to this.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.391
SAM: Can't you just
tell your mom and dad?

30:28.435 --> 30:30.089
They'll put an end
to all of this.

30:30.132 --> 30:31.612
ELI: No. They won't.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.093
They'll just put me
back on those pills again.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.834
SAM: That might not
be a bad idea.

30:39.794 --> 30:41.752
Do you even know
what you're looking for?

30:41.796 --> 30:43.145
ELI: I'll know it
when I see it.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.105
ELI: Hey, wait up.

30:46.148 --> 30:47.497
SAM: Dude, check this out!

30:47.541 --> 30:48.847
-What's up, goat?

30:50.587 --> 30:53.242
-Don't hurt me
-MAN: I'm gonna go
check on the goats.

30:53.286 --> 30:57.116
Hey, you boys interested
in some goat's milk?

30:57.159 --> 30:58.247
No, sir.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.641
Well, then the nursery's
down that way.

31:00.684 --> 31:03.296
Hey, mister, you ever hear
of Burghly Lumber?

31:07.474 --> 31:09.302
MAN: Burghly Lumber?

31:09.345 --> 31:13.175
Be careful, kids.
We don't use that name
around here anymore.

31:16.135 --> 31:18.180
As the story goes,

31:18.224 --> 31:21.183
that old man Burghly
killed the kids here.

31:23.316 --> 31:27.146
Didn't happen here.
He liked to run the saws.

31:27.189 --> 31:31.541
Chopped the kids into pieces,
like chicken.

31:33.021 --> 31:35.023
Then he'd bring
what was left back here,

31:35.067 --> 31:36.938
got rid of the evidence.

31:36.982 --> 31:40.072
Twelve kids later,
there was nothing.

31:40.115 --> 31:43.553
No skin, no bones,
not even a tooth.

31:44.685 --> 31:46.556
It was like
they all disappeared.

31:49.385 --> 31:52.606
When I was a kid,
around you boys' age,

31:52.649 --> 31:55.130
one of my friends
come up missing.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.524
He came to the furnace
and climbed in,

31:58.177 --> 32:00.570
and he never came out.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.833
So, he died
in the furnace?

32:02.877 --> 32:04.226
Wanna poke your head in
and see?

32:08.404 --> 32:10.580
Here, let's see if
you can wake him up.

32:13.322 --> 32:16.586
Throw it in.
You won't even hear a sound.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.690
Huh, guess he's not home.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.571
SAM: Come on.
Don't be chicken.

32:44.614 --> 32:45.876
ELI: I'm not a chicken.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.662
That guy just
freaked me out a little.

32:48.705 --> 32:51.230
SAM: Yeah. He's just old.

32:52.057 --> 32:54.407
Besides, I'm with you.

33:06.810 --> 33:09.378
Stop. I've seen this movie.

33:09.422 --> 33:10.771
It's just going to explode.

33:11.815 --> 33:12.991
Come on.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.779
Man. You got a lot
of junk down here.

33:20.694 --> 33:23.175
What is this?

33:23.218 --> 33:25.351
It's a family relic.
Be careful.

33:29.224 --> 33:32.010
So, this is where
the big BM lives.

33:34.534 --> 33:38.016
No. He lives over there,
by the furnace.

33:51.594 --> 33:52.856
I wanna meet him.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.998
It's practically summer.
Why's your furnace
even running?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.478
ELI: It's always running.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.702
This thing is like
100 years old.

34:14.313 --> 34:16.315
Sam, look.

34:22.843 --> 34:24.714
That's impossible.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.661
Anyone home?

35:26.559 --> 35:27.995
Sam, let's get out of here.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.000
Please?

35:38.005 --> 35:39.224
Don't do it.

36:30.318 --> 36:31.363
LIZ: Eli?

36:33.060 --> 36:34.366
Eli.

36:35.367 --> 36:37.238
-Eli!
-Yeah?

36:37.282 --> 36:39.632
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

36:39.675 --> 36:43.766
Video games, laptop,
any electronic thingamajig
goes in this bin.

36:43.810 --> 36:46.726
-Right now?
-Yeah. Right now.
Hop to it.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.297
LIZ: Eli, hurry up.
I don't have all day.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.517
ELI: Coming!

37:40.519 --> 37:42.303
-RICHARD: No.
I don't hate him.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.826
I actually like him.

37:43.870 --> 37:46.351
Problem is
he reminds me of me
when I was his age.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.440
That's what scares me.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.443
Dominic's
a safe driver, okay?

37:51.486 --> 37:53.749
RICHARD: If I can hear it
a mile down the road,
you shouldn't be riding in it.

37:54.576 --> 37:57.187
-Hey, buddy.
-EMILY: Heads up.

37:57.231 --> 37:58.841
I don't know what
you slipped Sam,

37:58.885 --> 38:02.105
but he didn't say a peep,
like, the whole way home.

38:02.149 --> 38:04.238
I didn't do anything.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.370
EMILY: I got your favorite.

38:05.413 --> 38:06.762
Vanilla caramel fudge.

38:08.198 --> 38:10.200
Why are you
being nice to me?

38:10.244 --> 38:11.680
Because I love you.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.076
What's going on?

38:16.119 --> 38:18.383
Your mother and I
are going out tonight,

38:18.426 --> 38:22.169
and Emily has agreed
that she's going to
stay here and babysit,

38:22.212 --> 38:23.823
because it's part
of her punishment.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.955
EMILY: It'll be fun.

38:25.999 --> 38:28.654
We'll watch a movie
or something.
I don't know.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.656
Figure out what
you want to do.
I'm gonna go shower.

38:32.788 --> 38:35.530
She actually bought you
an ice cream.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.053
It's gotta be
a record or something.

38:37.097 --> 38:38.707
You can't leave me
alone with her.

38:38.751 --> 38:39.839
She's gonna kill me.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.710
Nobody's going to
kill you, bud.

38:41.754 --> 38:42.842
Nobody.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.931
What have I
told you about girls?

38:44.974 --> 38:46.149
That they're crazy.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.064
Yeah.

38:48.108 --> 38:51.938
And you really think I'm
going to leave you home alone
with Mrs. Burghly?

38:52.678 --> 38:55.550
No. I called Dominic.

38:55.594 --> 38:58.205
He's gonna come
and "babysit" Emily.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.772
-Really?
-Yeah.

38:59.815 --> 39:02.383
But I don't want any
funny business tonight.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.429
You're my eyes
and ears, okay?

39:04.472 --> 39:06.213
You gotta keep
an eye on him.

39:06.256 --> 39:07.997
I will. Dominic's awesome.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.087
He's okay. Are we good?

39:12.524 --> 39:13.873
That a boy.

39:13.916 --> 39:15.614
Make sure you eat your
ice cream before it melts.

39:16.571 --> 39:18.704
-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.662
Mom's a girl.
Is she crazy?

39:40.987 --> 39:43.816
Dad, can you buy me
a generator?

41:08.291 --> 41:11.469
RICHARD: I mean, come on.
Another night of video games
isn't gonna hurt anybody.

41:11.512 --> 41:12.992
LIZ: You're such a pushover.

41:13.035 --> 41:14.428
RICHARD: By the way,
you look hot tonight.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.735
-Wow, Mom. You look amazing.

41:16.778 --> 41:19.433
"Wow, Mom"?
What about me?

41:19.477 --> 41:20.913
You look like
you're going to work.

41:22.741 --> 41:23.959
Thanks.

41:24.003 --> 41:25.700
Do you have
your phone, big guy?

41:27.485 --> 41:28.660
Okay, good.
Remember what I said.

41:28.703 --> 41:30.444
If Emily acts up,
you let me know.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.794
In case of emergency,
you go to Mr. Hynous' house.

41:32.838 --> 41:34.840
But Mr. Hynous hates people.

41:34.883 --> 41:37.451
Mr. Hynous
doesn't hate people,
just little kids.

41:39.627 --> 41:43.631
But you are my eyes
and ears tonight.

41:44.197 --> 41:45.285
Right?

41:45.851 --> 41:47.113
Good boy.

41:47.156 --> 41:48.897
I'm too young
to be a grandfather.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.377
LIZ: Come on, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

41:50.986 --> 41:52.205
I'll be thinking of you.

42:01.388 --> 42:02.563
Wow.

42:24.063 --> 42:25.586
SAM:
Eli, do you copy?

42:27.283 --> 42:29.590
-Are you there?
-Sam!

42:29.634 --> 42:30.939
Are you okay?

42:31.505 --> 42:32.724
Yeah.

42:32.767 --> 42:34.552
I'm sorry I chickened out.

42:35.161 --> 42:36.728
It's okay.

42:36.771 --> 42:39.165
It's just that I felt
what was down there,

42:39.208 --> 42:41.907
and that was way worse
than being scared.

42:42.647 --> 42:43.996
Now do you believe me?

42:44.039 --> 42:45.563
Yeah.

42:45.606 --> 42:49.175
But don't worry, Eli.
We're gonna
do this together.

42:49.218 --> 42:52.874
I'm gonna get
some professional help
from a rabbi or a priest.

42:52.918 --> 42:55.355
Or a ghost hunter,
like the ones on TV.

42:55.398 --> 42:56.574
Exactly.

42:58.837 --> 43:01.883
I gotta go. Dominic's here.
We'll talk later.

43:02.536 --> 43:03.581
Okay.

43:04.190 --> 43:05.365
Hey, Eli.

43:05.408 --> 43:07.497
Yeah?

43:07.541 --> 43:09.630
We're gonna
bust ourselves a ghost.

43:14.809 --> 43:17.203
Dominic! Come on.

43:17.246 --> 43:18.639
DOMINIC: What's up, buddy?

43:20.075 --> 43:21.555
Give me five.
To the side.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.643
Down low.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.427
Whoa. You're messin'
with my flow.

43:24.993 --> 43:26.212
So what's the plan?

43:26.255 --> 43:29.128
Candy, video games,
movie, and more candy.

43:29.171 --> 43:30.520
-Let's fire it up.

43:32.610 --> 43:35.569
VOICE:
In three, two, one.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.049
-Mmm-hmm?
-I'm good.

43:39.878 --> 43:41.575
She's upstairs
putting on makeup.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.316
You know
she's half zombie, right?

43:44.534 --> 43:45.535
Yeah.

43:47.494 --> 43:48.930
But she's a cute zombie.

43:50.192 --> 43:52.630
Is this one new?
I haven't played
this one before.

43:52.673 --> 43:54.849
Yeah. It's epic,
but I suck at it.

43:54.893 --> 43:56.372
-I can't figure out...
-Wow.

43:57.939 --> 43:59.201
Wow. Uh...

44:00.507 --> 44:02.117
I, uh...

44:02.161 --> 44:03.989
I thought we were just
chillin' here tonight?

44:04.032 --> 44:06.295
I'm gonna call Mom,
and you're gonna be
grounded forever.

44:06.339 --> 44:10.125
Mom and Dad are crazy
if they think I'm wasting
a Saturday night on you.

44:15.740 --> 44:16.784
Sam, help!

44:16.828 --> 44:17.872
DOMINIC: Emily!

44:20.875 --> 44:22.398
EMILY: Game over, loser.

44:23.922 --> 44:25.184
SAM:  Eli?

44:26.707 --> 44:27.752
You okay, buddy?

44:32.408 --> 44:33.671
SAM: Eli?

44:33.714 --> 44:35.629
Now, you stay here
and keep your mouth shut,

44:35.673 --> 44:37.805
or I'm really gonna
make your life a living hell.

44:51.471 --> 44:54.213
Hey, he's just a kid.
We can't leave him here.

44:54.256 --> 44:59.218
You can stay here
and babysit if you want.
I'm leaving.

45:03.004 --> 45:04.484
It's just a few hours.

45:05.964 --> 45:08.009
I'll make it up to you.
I'll come by tomorrow.

45:08.053 --> 45:09.402
We'll go for a ride
in the Firebreather.

45:10.620 --> 45:11.752
Sound good?

45:11.796 --> 45:12.840
Let's go.

45:20.892 --> 45:21.980
Be good.

45:24.069 --> 45:28.160
Or the man downstairs
might pay you a visit.

46:52.026 --> 46:53.593
VOICE:
Golem bash.

48:45.661 --> 48:48.099
ELI: Mr. Hynous!
Mr. Hynous!

48:48.969 --> 48:50.623
Mr. Hynous!

48:50.666 --> 48:52.451
Mr. Hynous!

48:52.494 --> 48:54.105
Mr. Hynous!

48:54.148 --> 48:56.324
-MAN: Get the fuck outta
the middle of the road.

49:15.604 --> 49:18.129
Quickly. After that
submersible. Yah!

49:20.087 --> 49:22.176
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey, buddy.
How's it goin' there?

49:22.220 --> 49:24.831
So listen. Me and the guys
here have been talking,

49:24.874 --> 49:29.792
and, well, there's no real
easy way of puttin' this,
but, uh...

49:29.836 --> 49:31.316
We're kicking you
out of the ocean, bitch.

49:59.692 --> 50:01.781
We gotta go
get this walkie, buddy.

50:07.526 --> 50:09.180
-Good night, my love.
-Good night.

50:10.398 --> 50:12.922
And now I lay me
down to sleep.

50:12.966 --> 50:14.924
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

50:15.838 --> 50:17.362
If I die before I wake,

50:17.405 --> 50:19.407
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

50:59.969 --> 51:01.971
ELI:
Hot Rod, watch my back,

51:02.015 --> 51:04.148
and make sure
the door stays open.

51:07.325 --> 51:08.761
My light is strong.

51:09.892 --> 51:11.981
My light is strong.

51:12.025 --> 51:13.548
My light is strong.

51:41.968 --> 51:44.013
Where is it?

51:51.673 --> 51:53.110
My light is strong.

51:54.198 --> 51:55.590
My light is strong.

51:56.200 --> 51:57.853
My light is strong.

52:02.336 --> 52:03.816
It should be right here.

52:04.817 --> 52:06.732
Come on.
Where are you?

52:14.131 --> 52:16.002
He's gonna wake up.
Come on.

53:26.986 --> 53:28.117
Whoa!

55:22.406 --> 55:23.407
SAM:  Eli?

55:24.712 --> 55:27.411
Are you there?
Do you copy?

56:00.922 --> 56:04.448
You can bust
every light in this house,

56:04.491 --> 56:06.711
but you won't touch
the light inside of me.

56:09.278 --> 56:11.585
Get out!

56:11.629 --> 56:15.067
Or I'll make sure
the lights never
go off down here.

58:00.259 --> 58:01.478
WiFi!

58:03.697 --> 58:05.830
Come on. Send.
Send. Send.

58:05.873 --> 58:08.136
Can you believe
we actually made it here?

58:08.180 --> 58:10.356
I know.
It took like an hour,

58:10.399 --> 58:11.792
but I really like what
they've done with the place.

58:11.836 --> 58:13.446
No.
I don't mean here, here.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.187
I mean, okay, come on.

58:15.230 --> 58:18.146
Fifteen years ago,
no way would I have
seen us on a VIP list.

58:19.496 --> 58:22.194
Now I...
I think we're socialites.

58:23.587 --> 58:24.936
Do me a favor.

58:24.979 --> 58:26.285
Shoot me right here.

58:29.680 --> 58:31.116
It's Eli.

58:41.430 --> 58:42.693
Is he still alive?

58:42.736 --> 58:45.652
LIZ:  Yeah,
and he's kicking butt.

58:53.747 --> 58:55.619
That Dominic never
ceases to amaze me.

58:57.142 --> 58:58.709
He's a good kid.

58:58.752 --> 59:01.102
I don't know what the hell
he's doing with Emily though.

59:11.417 --> 59:12.940
ELI: You gotta be kidding me.

59:26.214 --> 59:28.434
Sam. Please help.

59:32.743 --> 59:34.701
- Eli.

59:37.617 --> 59:41.490
-Hillary? What are
you doing here?

59:41.534 --> 59:44.319
The power went out
and I couldn't find my mom.

59:45.538 --> 59:48.410
I heard the Burghly Monster
in my room.

59:48.454 --> 59:51.109
Eli, I don't think
you should go back
in your house.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.982
It's hard to breathe.

59:56.027 --> 59:57.463
You're not Hillary.

59:59.421 --> 1:00:01.249
-SAM:  Eli?
-Sam!

1:00:01.293 --> 1:00:03.600
HILLARY:
Don't go back in there.

1:00:08.039 --> 1:00:10.258
-You're busted.

1:00:16.917 --> 1:00:18.397
Eli? Do you copy?

1:00:19.877 --> 1:00:22.880
HILLARY: Come back!
I need your help!

1:00:22.923 --> 1:00:25.970
Sam! Come in, please!
Come back. Sam!

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:28.625
Eli? You there?

1:00:30.670 --> 1:00:32.977
Sam! Come back, please.

1:00:33.020 --> 1:00:34.587
-HILLARY: Eli!
-Sam!

1:00:36.633 --> 1:00:38.460
HILLARY:
You need to come with me.

1:00:40.375 --> 1:00:41.768
Please!

1:00:43.378 --> 1:00:45.206
Get out of your house.

1:01:21.634 --> 1:01:23.288
Don't worry, I got you.

1:01:23.331 --> 1:01:25.159
-We've got work to do.

1:01:56.147 --> 1:01:57.278
Ah!

1:03:06.086 --> 1:03:07.609
SAM:  Eli?

1:03:07.653 --> 1:03:09.655
-Sam!
-Eli.

1:03:10.612 --> 1:03:13.485
Eli, I... I can't hear you.

1:03:13.528 --> 1:03:15.661
The Burghly Monster's
after me. I need help.
