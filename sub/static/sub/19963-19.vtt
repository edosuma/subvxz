00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:04.005 --> 00:06.505
(theme song playing)

00:08.943 --> 00:12.111
¶ I got the wind in my hair
and a fire within ¶

00:12.113 --> 00:14.346
¶ 'Cause there's
something beginning ¶

00:14.348 --> 00:19.852
¶ I got a mystery to solve
and excitement to spare ¶

00:19.854 --> 00:22.955
¶ That beautiful breeze
blowing through ¶

00:27.828 --> 00:30.829
¶ And I'll get there, I swear ¶

00:30.831 --> 00:35.367
¶ With the wind in my hair ¶

00:53.821 --> 00:56.255
-Oh, confound
these infernal streamers!
-(laughing)

00:56.257 --> 01:00.759
Aww.
Is the mighty king
having a hard time?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.594
It's not funny.
Have you any idea

01:02.596 --> 01:03.829
how difficult it is to--

01:03.831 --> 01:06.165
(clears throat)

01:06.167 --> 01:07.232
(giggles)

01:07.234 --> 01:09.234
Oh. Hm.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.403
(both laughing)

01:16.343 --> 01:17.409
(gasp)

01:23.050 --> 01:24.116
(gasp)

01:26.787 --> 01:33.058
Rapunzel!
Stay here, with me,
where you belong.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.860
Varian:
Rapunzel! Help me!

01:34.862 --> 01:36.195
Darling, don't!

01:37.131 --> 01:38.297
Dad!

01:38.299 --> 01:39.364
(crashing sounds)

01:39.366 --> 01:40.466
Dad!

01:41.635 --> 01:43.135
Whoa! Whoa!

01:51.946 --> 01:53.378
Dad?

01:53.380 --> 01:55.380
Rapunzel!

01:55.382 --> 01:56.648
You promised!

01:56.650 --> 01:57.716
What?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.487
(Rapunzel shouts indistinctly)

02:02.790 --> 02:03.989
(explosion)

02:03.991 --> 02:05.157
Varian:
Aah!

02:08.929 --> 02:11.063
Hey, Blondie, you want--
Aah!

02:11.065 --> 02:12.297
Rapunzel!

02:12.299 --> 02:13.632
Aah! Ah...

02:15.002 --> 02:16.468
What happened?
Are you okay?

02:16.470 --> 02:19.938
I-- I-- I-- I don't know.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.206
Oh...

02:25.446 --> 02:26.912
Oh...

02:33.454 --> 02:37.990
It was like the dream I had
after my coronation,
only more intense.

02:37.992 --> 02:42.261
This one-- This one
was trying to tell me something.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.329
Tell you what?

02:44.331 --> 02:50.869
I'm not sure.
The rocks, my hair, Varian,
it's like they're all connected,

02:50.871 --> 02:53.305
and I have to find out how.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.508
Uh, hey guys,
sorry to interrupt
dream chat here,

02:56.510 --> 02:58.510
but is no one else
even a little bit concerned

02:58.512 --> 03:00.979
that Rapunzel woke up
suspended in mid-air?

03:00.981 --> 03:02.548
(squeaking)

03:02.550 --> 03:05.984
Eugene, what I saw...
meant something.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.619
Okay.
Let's say it did.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.289
But what if it was a warning,
telling you to stay here,

03:10.291 --> 03:11.356
where you're safe.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.158
I mean, we got it
pretty good here, right?

03:13.160 --> 03:16.328
Maybe you should
leave the mystery
behind these rocks alone.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.530
No.
I can't.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.499
I need answers.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.701
And I think I know
where to start looking.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.476
I made it clear
that we were not to discuss
magic or glowing rocks.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.879
Has anyone been
to old Corona recently?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.516
I'm worried that Varian
is in trouble.

03:37.518 --> 03:41.153
Princess, Varian is dangerous.

03:41.155 --> 03:44.189
Have you forgotten
the boy attacked you
during the storm--

03:44.191 --> 03:45.490
Nigel!

03:47.161 --> 03:48.493
Come with me.

03:53.234 --> 03:57.269
I've been aware of these rocks
for quite some time.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.538
They posed a real problem.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.507
Um-- Displacing people
from their homes,

04:02.509 --> 04:05.544
-damaging roads...
-Oh, no.

04:05.546 --> 04:10.015
But-- But fortunately,
we've taken care of them,
one by one.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.618
The rocks have been removed,
and the people of Old Corona

04:12.620 --> 04:13.785
are all well and good.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.855
But why all the secrecy?

04:16.857 --> 04:21.560
Rapunzel, I apologize
for not being more candid
at first.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.795
I can only hope
that when you're queen,

04:23.797 --> 04:26.798
you'll understand the value
of not drawing attention

04:26.800 --> 04:31.903
and causing a panic
over problems that...
have been handled.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.873
You see?
And now you know
what the situation is.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.642
Or rather, was.

04:36.644 --> 04:41.480
That's a relief.
And thanks for being honest
with me, Dad.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.315
Yes.
Of course.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.785
Now, run along.
We've got more pressing issues
before us.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.954
Like planning
your birthday party.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.562
Happy Birthday, Rapunzel!

04:57.564 --> 04:59.965
Thank you!

04:59.967 --> 05:02.701
We still don't know anything
about where Varian is-- (gasp)

05:05.606 --> 05:08.840
The kite!
Wait-- It's the same one
from my vision!

05:10.144 --> 05:11.576
There's a note!

05:11.578 --> 05:13.312
And a key!

05:13.314 --> 05:14.980
It's from Varian.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.150
"Rapunzel, I need your help
now more than ever.

05:18.152 --> 05:21.253
"I may have discovered
the key to the rocks.

05:21.255 --> 05:23.588
"Find the bronze graphtyc
in my lab.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.757
"But be careful.
They are watching

05:25.759 --> 05:27.959
and will do anything
to stop you."

05:27.961 --> 05:29.761
They?
Who are they?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.763
It's always somethin'
with that guy.

05:31.765 --> 05:35.334
I knew it!
I knew it, he still
needs our help.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.735
What do you wanna do?

05:41.775 --> 05:42.974
(sighs)

05:42.976 --> 05:45.877
Sorry, Dad.
We gotta go to Old Corona.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.954
Old Corona
is just over this hill.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.558
(squeaking)

05:59.560 --> 06:00.826
Hoo!

06:00.828 --> 06:03.161
Sorry, Pascal,
but he's not a big fan
of reptiles.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.963
Unless he can eat them.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.834
(squeaking)

06:08.836 --> 06:12.137
I can't tell you
what a treat it is
to be spending so much time

06:12.139 --> 06:14.706
with a cold-blooded
dead-eyed bird of prey.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.008
Owls are warm-blooded, genius.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.745
(chuckles)
I wasn't talking about
the owl.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.347
Oh-hoo-hoo, I guess I walked
right into that one.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.749
(chuckles)
Yeah, you really did!

06:23.751 --> 06:24.916
Stop the cart!

06:24.918 --> 06:26.151
(curious grunt)

06:30.057 --> 06:32.023
What is it?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.860
My dad told me
that all the black rocks

06:34.862 --> 06:36.428
had been removed.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.330
Okay!
So he missed one!

06:38.332 --> 06:40.332
Um... guys?

06:42.736 --> 06:45.604
Or one hundred.
They missed a hun--
They-- They did not

06:45.606 --> 06:47.606
do a very thorough job
counting these rocks.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.374
Do you think your father lied?

06:49.376 --> 06:54.179
No, of course not.
I trust my father,
but clearly he has no idea

06:54.181 --> 06:56.415
how bad things
have gotten out here.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.483
Come on.
Let's move on.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.855
Hoo!

07:14.968 --> 07:17.235
I've never seen
anything like this.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.272
So far, everything
in my dream has come true,

07:20.274 --> 07:22.307
there's no question now.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.709
These rocks...
they hold a secret,

07:24.711 --> 07:27.646
and somehow,
I-- I'm-- I'm connected to it.

07:32.653 --> 07:37.255
And... maybe even
responsible for it.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.657
What do you wanna do?

07:40.761 --> 07:41.626
I'm sorry, Eugene,

07:41.628 --> 07:44.930
but I already
let Varian down once.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.665
He wants us
to get that graphtyc

07:46.667 --> 07:49.167
and that's what we're gonna do.

07:54.308 --> 07:57.442
Well, let's go.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.644
Varian's home
is on the far side of town.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.379
You heard the lady.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.855
-(squeaking)
-Eugene:
Aah!

08:09.857 --> 08:11.790
Uh, Blondie?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.091
-Hair?
-Fancy Pants is right.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.960
Remember what happens
when you touch those.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.094
Mmm...

08:16.096 --> 08:18.430
Well, then I'll just
have to be careful.

08:19.867 --> 08:23.368
How do we know
if any of these openings
will take us to the other side?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.370
We need a bird's eye view.

08:25.372 --> 08:29.741
-(whistles)
-(owl hooting)

08:33.046 --> 08:35.514
-(hooting)
-I think he found a way.

08:35.516 --> 08:38.250
-Okay, Max?
You keep watch.
-(grunting)

08:39.820 --> 08:42.053
-So, you think I'm fancy?
-Ugh...

08:42.055 --> 08:43.889
That's not a retraction!

08:49.663 --> 08:51.296
We're here.

08:51.298 --> 08:55.867
(Eugene grunting)
Well! What a convenient,
easy-to-navigate path

08:55.869 --> 08:59.638
your bird found, Cass.
That is some owl
you got there.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.907
Hhh-- Thanks.
Oh, and by the way?

09:01.909 --> 09:03.808
He's also an attack owl.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.244
I taught him
to go for the eyes first.

09:06.246 --> 09:10.582
Huh-- Mmm.
Of course, by some owl,
I meant some very noble,

09:10.584 --> 09:14.886
very majestic,
very non-eye-scratchy,
did I mention majestic?

09:14.888 --> 09:15.820
Owl.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.762
You know, someone should really
sit this kid down,

09:23.764 --> 09:25.564
and have a frank discussion
about the importance

09:25.566 --> 09:27.799
of an organized,
clutter-free workspace.

09:30.871 --> 09:31.770
Look at all these.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.438
-What is--
-(bursting)

09:33.440 --> 09:35.307
(coughing)

09:37.578 --> 09:39.778
(squeaking)

09:41.682 --> 09:42.747
(squeaking)

09:42.749 --> 09:44.616
(laughs, clears throat)

09:44.618 --> 09:48.787
Guys, come on.
That graphtyc has to be
here somewhere.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.796
(gasp)

09:57.798 --> 09:59.931
I found it!
I found the graphtyc!

09:59.933 --> 10:01.700
Great!
Now let's get outta here

10:01.702 --> 10:03.468
'cause this place
gives me the creeps.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.476
(gasp)

10:13.914 --> 10:14.879
(gasp)

10:20.387 --> 10:23.388
Oh, no!
It's Varian's father!

10:23.390 --> 10:25.290
Blondie, are you okay?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.925
Maybe you were right.

10:26.927 --> 10:30.562
Maybe my dream
was trying to tell me
to stay in the castle...

10:30.564 --> 10:32.430
where I belong.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.966
Rapunzel, what are you
talking about?

10:34.968 --> 10:38.737
I touched those rocks
and now... this.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.940
Oh, come on, now.
We don't know that any of this
is your fault.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.808
We don't know that it's not.

10:43.810 --> 10:47.646
Okay, Princess?
I know what I said before
about forgetting all this,

10:47.648 --> 10:51.516
but this is way, way worse
than I or anyone else imagined,

10:51.518 --> 10:53.351
and one thing
has become clear.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.855
Fault or no fault,
people are in danger.
A lot of danger,

10:56.857 --> 11:00.191
and the Rapunzel I know
was never one to run
and hide from a fight.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.328
-(door swings open)
-(gasping)

11:03.330 --> 11:04.863
Hand over the graphtyc.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.766
-Who is that?
-Must be a friend of Varian's.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.535
(shouts)

11:10.537 --> 11:13.705
-(grunting)
-(weapons clashing)

11:13.707 --> 11:14.773
Aahh!

11:16.710 --> 11:17.942
Ohhh!

11:17.944 --> 11:21.012
Cass!
Oh, you just
crossed a line, bub!

11:27.287 --> 11:28.353
-Whoa--
-(hooting)

11:28.355 --> 11:29.888
Whoaaa!

11:29.890 --> 11:31.389
(groans)

11:31.391 --> 11:34.693
Oh, boy, that was--
that was a mistake.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.960
(angry hooting)

11:35.962 --> 11:37.295
Hand it over, now.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.398
(squeaking)

11:42.502 --> 11:44.703
(squeaking)

11:44.705 --> 11:45.870
(grunting)

11:45.872 --> 11:47.172
(crash)

11:47.174 --> 11:49.808
Stay back!
I've got a wall
full of alchemy

11:49.810 --> 11:51.976
and I am not afraid
to use it!

11:51.978 --> 11:52.911
-(grunts)
-(crash)

11:52.913 --> 11:54.546
Pascal!
Hit me!

11:55.482 --> 11:59.517
-(crash)
-Ugh-- Stink bomb?
Come on!

11:59.519 --> 12:01.553
-(grunts)
-(crash)

12:01.555 --> 12:03.388
-(crash, crash)

12:03.390 --> 12:04.556
-(grunts)

12:09.830 --> 12:10.929
Ha! Thanks!

12:12.199 --> 12:15.400
-(crash)
-Yeah!
That oughta hold you!

12:17.404 --> 12:19.270
All right, come on!
Let's get outta here!

12:30.183 --> 12:33.284
Slow down, Rapunzel!
Your hair touches these things
and we're goners!

12:33.286 --> 12:34.686
Yeah!
What she said!

12:34.688 --> 12:37.388
We don't have much time
before he gets free!

12:37.390 --> 12:40.725
-Who was that?
-Ahh, I don't know,
but it must've been

12:40.727 --> 12:42.260
who Varian was trying
to warn us--

12:42.262 --> 12:43.695
Ohh!

12:43.697 --> 12:44.829
Aah!

12:46.366 --> 12:48.800
(Eugene grunts)
How fast is this guy?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.937
-Ahh--
-Huh!

12:54.040 --> 12:57.976
Well, I guess that explains
why he could move so fast.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.816
Cassandra, you take
the ones in black,

13:04.818 --> 13:06.284
We'll handle the rest.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.125
(squeaking)

13:16.129 --> 13:17.495
(clang)

13:17.497 --> 13:18.963
(whinnying)

13:22.435 --> 13:25.870
(clanging)

13:28.008 --> 13:29.407
(clang)

13:29.409 --> 13:32.443
Max!
Oh, you couldn't have
come a second sooner!

13:32.445 --> 13:34.078
-Take us home, big guy!
-Whoaaa!

13:38.919 --> 13:42.020
These guys want
whatever this is
pretty badly.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.988
Something tells me
we won't make it
to the castle.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.858
She's right.
We need somewhere to hide
and come up with a plan.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.459
I know just the place.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.061
Yah!

13:51.498 --> 13:52.597
(neighs)

13:59.005 --> 14:00.972
-We're here.
-Here?

14:00.974 --> 14:02.173
Where's here?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.542
You said we needed
a place to hide.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.877
Here we are.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.046
And once again,
where is here?

14:08.048 --> 14:10.181
(owl hooting)

14:10.183 --> 14:12.951
-They're following us.
-Guys, come on!

14:16.356 --> 14:19.090
What are you slow pokes
waiting for?

14:20.861 --> 14:25.330
Okay, Eugene, today
we are rappelling down the side
of a cliff with a horse,

14:25.332 --> 14:28.199
princess, and a frog.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.001
Man, I love Corona!

14:30.003 --> 14:31.102
Ha-ha!

14:34.641 --> 14:35.840
(grunts)

14:35.842 --> 14:37.675
(whinnying)

14:37.677 --> 14:41.346
-(Eugene groans)
-(spits)

14:41.348 --> 14:45.450
Eugene, I'm surprised
you didn't recognize
where we are.

14:47.888 --> 14:51.723
Actually, now I'm not sure
I recognize it.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.392
Eugene:
This is bad.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.160
(sigh)
These rocks are
an even bigger problem

14:56.162 --> 14:57.862
than we thought.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.563
Huh?
Oh, no, actually, I was talking
about my vest.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.533
I got it dirty during the fall,
but, uh-- (clears throat)

15:02.535 --> 15:04.936
yeah-- no, those rocks
are bad, super bad.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.962
Eugene:
Oh, and this is where
she hit me with a frying pan

15:30.964 --> 15:32.897
for the very first time.
Little known fact,

15:32.899 --> 15:35.099
but the blow actually
improved my hairline.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.069
Yeah, pre-pan, cowlick,
post-pan perfection.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.938
What is so important
about this thing?

15:39.940 --> 15:43.274
Oh, uh, watch your step, pal.
That's where I died. See?

15:43.276 --> 15:46.577
Have you seen
anything like this?

15:46.579 --> 15:48.313
It sounds like
something's inside.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.214
-(shaking noise)
-Eugene:
Googly eyes, hair a mess...

15:50.216 --> 15:54.886
This is the armoire
where Rapunzel hid
my unconscious body.

15:54.888 --> 15:58.323
You remember that, honey?
Ha-ha-- What a romantic
first date.

15:58.325 --> 16:02.226
-(grunting)
-(Eugene continues talking)

16:02.228 --> 16:03.795
Rapunzel:
Wait a minute.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.664
The key!

16:06.666 --> 16:08.800
Eugene:
Aww, why the long face?
Heh-heh-heh!

16:08.802 --> 16:10.835
It's okay, I came back alive.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.406
Rapunzel:
It's some kind of scroll.

16:15.408 --> 16:19.644
Oh, uh, this is where
Mother Gothel fell
to her doom.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.314
Guys?
I think we have a problem?

16:30.357 --> 16:32.423
You've gotta be kidding!

16:32.425 --> 16:33.758
What do you wanna do, Blondie?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.194
No more running,
no more hiding.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.964
These guys just ticked off
the wrong princess.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.165
That's my girl!

16:43.269 --> 16:45.937
Sorry, Eugene, frying pans
are great and all,

16:45.939 --> 16:48.373
but... it's time for an upgrade.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.178
Rapunzel, what are you doing?

16:54.180 --> 16:56.714
Letting down my hair.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.300
(gasp)

17:17.303 --> 17:18.603
(crash)

17:20.907 --> 17:22.240
(grunts)

17:24.411 --> 17:26.544
(neighs, grunts)

17:28.882 --> 17:32.717
(crashing)

17:37.257 --> 17:40.491
Um, I did not expect the rocks
to follow me all the way
up here.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.394
-What did you expect them to do?
-(crashing sounds)

17:43.396 --> 17:45.163
Come on!

17:45.165 --> 17:46.431
(whinnying)

17:50.603 --> 17:53.337
(crashing)

17:53.339 --> 17:54.439
Oh!

17:56.276 --> 18:00.144
(hooting)

18:01.347 --> 18:03.748
That's the only way out!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.316
Let's go!
Come on!

18:19.232 --> 18:21.332
So, horses can climb now!
That's a thing.

18:23.069 --> 18:26.370
(crashing)

18:31.277 --> 18:33.544
Hoo... hoo!

18:33.546 --> 18:36.380
Oooh... oooh!

18:36.382 --> 18:40.451
Hoo! Hoo? Hoo!

18:40.453 --> 18:43.121
-(hooting)
-(whinnying)

18:43.123 --> 18:46.724
(crashing)

18:56.803 --> 18:59.237
There is only one way down!

19:03.476 --> 19:05.743
(crashing sounds)

19:05.745 --> 19:07.311
Guys, I think I have a way out,

19:07.313 --> 19:10.748
but it's a little crazy,
so you're just gonna
have to trust me.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.919
-(crashing sounds)
-Uh, sure, let's go for it!

19:14.921 --> 19:16.320
I'm up for anything
at this point.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.590
-Follow me!
-Ohh! Even your hands
are cold!

19:19.592 --> 19:22.426
-(hooting)
-(squeaking)

19:23.463 --> 19:24.395
Let's go!

19:27.433 --> 19:31.369
I cannot believe
we're doing this!

19:51.024 --> 19:53.524
Uh-- Did everyone see that?
Is-- Is that new?

19:53.526 --> 19:56.460
Uhh, let's just say
it's complicated.

19:58.364 --> 20:02.433
(crumbling)

20:09.342 --> 20:14.579
(crashing)

20:22.488 --> 20:25.623
Can we avoid going up
in towers from now on?

20:27.427 --> 20:28.593
Mm...

20:36.736 --> 20:38.336
(sigh)

20:38.338 --> 20:40.238
Are you okay?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.572
(grunt)

20:41.574 --> 20:44.108
Guys? You wanna
have a look at this?

20:44.110 --> 20:46.210
(grunting)

20:46.212 --> 20:48.145
Time for answers.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.020
Dad?

21:00.126 --> 21:05.630
Princess... we had orders
to recover the scroll,
to keep it from you.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.498
Who? Who ordered you?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.534
Answer her.

21:10.536 --> 21:13.004
(gulp)
Your father.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.292
Why would your father
wanna keep this from you?

21:34.294 --> 21:37.995
I don't know.
But I'm going to find out.

21:52.178 --> 21:55.413
(theme music playing)

21:55.415 --> 21:58.449
¶ Now I got my eyes open
and wide ¶

21:58.451 --> 22:00.918
¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶

22:00.920 --> 22:03.087
¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶

22:03.089 --> 22:05.156
¶ I'm never goin' back ¶

22:05.158 --> 22:08.326
¶ Whatever I want now,
I'm gonna chase ¶

22:08.328 --> 22:10.628
¶ Who I am,
I can't contain it ¶

22:10.630 --> 22:13.964
¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶

22:13.966 --> 22:17.601
¶ 'Cause there's more of me
to give ¶

22:17.603 --> 22:18.769
¶ Oh yeah ¶

22:18.771 --> 22:20.938
¶ There's more of me to give ¶
