00:16.645 --> 00:19.847
They didn't have Plain mint,
so I got you Raspberry mint.

00:20.668 --> 00:23.751
- And a Mystery Meat Sandwich.
- Yum.

00:23.785 --> 00:25.753
So, did you get Mom and Dad a card yet?

00:25.787 --> 00:28.656
Or do you wanna just sign this one?

00:28.690 --> 00:30.069
I was gonna get them a card.

00:30.189 --> 00:32.366
- Right.
- Gimme that.

00:41.836 --> 00:43.462
Beautiful, huh?

00:44.005 --> 00:46.674
- Huh?
- The countryside.

00:48.102 --> 00:49.590
Oh, uh...

00:50.645 --> 00:52.813
Just sign the card.

00:52.847 --> 00:54.882
Excuse me for looking
out for my little sister.

00:55.216 --> 00:57.351
- All grown up now, thanks.
- You never know,

00:57.385 --> 00:58.866
it could be a serial
killer or something.

00:58.986 --> 01:00.954
Shh. Keep your voice down.

01:00.988 --> 01:02.556
You know, if you talk low like this,

01:02.590 --> 01:04.491
it's actually harder
to hear than a whisper.

01:04.525 --> 01:05.959
You're making that up.

01:05.993 --> 01:07.961
Tell that to the Taliban.

01:13.034 --> 01:15.769
Jeez, Cali, you wrote
them a novel, here.

01:15.803 --> 01:17.571
About another hour until we get there.

01:17.605 --> 01:19.773
You'll think of something.

01:41.529 --> 01:43.363
All passengers connecting to bus lines

01:43.397 --> 01:46.299
at Hartford Station,
please use platform two.

02:00.986 --> 02:02.983
- What are you doing?
- I need you to do

02:03.103 --> 02:05.886
exactly as I say. No time for
questions. Just listen.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.978
When I start walking down
this car, I want you to

02:08.098 --> 02:09.656
grab that backpack, there. See it?

02:09.691 --> 02:10.890
Bryan, what's going on?

02:10.925 --> 02:12.326
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.660
If the guy in the sport
coat tells you it's his,

02:13.695 --> 02:14.728
you argue with him and you keep it going

02:14.762 --> 02:16.997
until I either come back
or I shout out your name.

02:17.031 --> 02:19.399
But if I shout your name,
you get down as fast as you can

02:19.434 --> 02:20.934
and you crawl into a
space between those seats.

02:20.969 --> 02:23.904
- You're really scaring me.
- Just do as I say.

02:23.938 --> 02:25.639
Everything's gonna be fine.

02:36.351 --> 02:37.451
- Hey, excuse me?
- Yeah?

02:37.485 --> 02:40.587
- That belongs to me.
- What? No, I-I don't think so.

02:40.622 --> 02:42.322
- Yeah, it does.
- Please, just give it back.

02:42.357 --> 02:44.428
- No need to talk to me like that.
- Check the name.

02:44.548 --> 02:46.593
This is my bag. What the hell
is your problem, miss?

02:46.628 --> 02:47.794
I don't care what you're
saying, this is my bag.

02:47.829 --> 02:49.663
- No, this is mine, all right?
- Just let go of the bag.

02:49.697 --> 02:51.431
No, I'm not gonna let go!

02:51.466 --> 02:52.599
- Give me my bag back.
- Cali!

02:52.634 --> 02:54.301
Aah!

02:56.571 --> 02:58.272
- What are they doing?
- Get down!

03:02.510 --> 03:04.611
Get out! Get out!

03:19.260 --> 03:20.260
Oh!

03:25.033 --> 03:26.500
Okay, listen up, I'm a cop.

03:26.534 --> 03:29.002
No one move, all right?
Everyone stay where you are.

03:29.037 --> 03:30.070
You got cuffs?

03:45.620 --> 03:47.054
Cali.

04:38.306 --> 04:39.306
Yep.

04:40.775 --> 04:43.377
No, I'm not near a TV.
Just gimme the headlines.

05:05.133 --> 05:07.668
Bryan! Bryan!

05:07.788 --> 05:10.604
Bryan, Bryan, can you
tell us what happened?

05:10.638 --> 05:11.838
Channel 7, may I ask you a question?

05:11.873 --> 05:14.541
This is a very difficult time
for my family, as you can see.

05:15.543 --> 05:17.047
A little respect for
that right now would be

05:17.167 --> 05:19.563
- much appreciated.
- Bryan, what tipped you off?

05:41.736 --> 05:43.563
Have you eaten anything, Bry?

05:45.740 --> 05:47.512
I fixed you something.

06:01.689 --> 06:04.305
- What's local law enforcement saying?
- Still waiting for a statement.

06:04.425 --> 06:07.175
- And the surviving gunman?
- Refusing to talk without a lawyer.

06:07.295 --> 06:09.362
What, no outbursts? No delusional rants?

06:09.397 --> 06:12.432
Total silence is what we're hearing.

06:12.467 --> 06:13.934
Okay, now I'm interested.

06:13.968 --> 06:16.736
Then there's this. Bryan Mills.

06:16.771 --> 06:19.372
Ex-military, green beret,
three tours in Afghanistan...

06:19.407 --> 06:21.784
Mm, I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say this isn't Middle East-related.

06:21.904 --> 06:24.744
Puerto Berrío, Colombia, January 2015.

06:24.779 --> 06:26.947
Mills's last active service posting,

06:26.981 --> 06:29.616
as Liaison to Colombian special forces

06:29.650 --> 06:33.353
for operation "Snow Joe,"
to capture Carlos Mejia,

06:33.387 --> 06:35.922
aka, "El Carnicero." "The
Butcher". Whatever.

06:35.957 --> 06:37.858
Last seen seven years ago.

06:37.892 --> 06:40.360
CIA, based on source and asset reports

06:40.394 --> 06:42.696
believes his cartel is now
running terrorists and weapons

06:42.730 --> 06:44.297
as well as drugs into the U.S.

06:44.332 --> 06:46.366
- Puerto where?
- Berrío.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.268
Thing is, Mejia wasn't even there.

06:48.302 --> 06:50.837
But his son, Miguel, was.

06:52.807 --> 06:54.407
Our friend on the train do this?

06:54.442 --> 06:57.410
Yep, while saving the life
of an undercover DEA agent.

06:57.445 --> 06:58.445
Mike Hall.

06:58.913 --> 07:01.615
If this is Mejia avenging
the death of his son,

07:01.649 --> 07:04.718
he's probably not gonna
stop until it's done.

07:07.288 --> 07:08.288
Good.

07:09.857 --> 07:12.826
Good. So, starting right now,

07:12.860 --> 07:14.628
we control the story.

07:14.662 --> 07:17.597
Write State and Local Law
Enforcement, FBI, CIA.

07:17.632 --> 07:19.566
I want everyone on the
same sheet of music.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.669
This was two delusional maniacs,
investigation ongoing.

07:22.703 --> 07:23.937
Okay? You guys know the rest.

07:23.971 --> 07:27.407
You call the National Security
Advisor, tell him I'm on my way.

07:40.821 --> 07:42.091
Who are you?

07:44.458 --> 07:46.010
- _
- Okay. Good.

07:47.014 --> 07:48.611
Unlock him, please.

07:59.807 --> 08:01.775
My associate, Becca.

08:01.809 --> 08:03.777
What did you tell the police?

08:03.811 --> 08:05.011
Nothing.

08:05.046 --> 08:07.480
- We have to ask.
- And now you know.

08:07.515 --> 08:08.949
- And tomorrow?
- What about it?

08:08.983 --> 08:10.617
And the next day? And the next day?

08:10.651 --> 08:12.018
And...

08:13.087 --> 08:14.524
I don't buy it.

08:15.823 --> 08:17.214
Excuse me?

08:17.658 --> 08:18.693
What she's saying is,
she doesn't believe

08:18.693 --> 08:21.795
it's possible for you
to say nothing forever.

08:21.829 --> 08:23.463
State police are one thing.

08:23.497 --> 08:24.798
But the type of people
we believe are gonna be

08:24.832 --> 08:26.466
coming at you next?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.001
I have to agree.

08:28.035 --> 08:30.337
Not sure I buy it either.

08:38.011 --> 08:39.379
What the hell is this?

08:39.413 --> 08:40.813
What were you expecting?

08:40.847 --> 08:43.015
They'd send someone to spring you?

08:43.049 --> 08:44.049
Really?

08:47.688 --> 08:49.756
Oh! Oh!

08:49.790 --> 08:52.659
Our client has instructed us
to tell you that your family

08:52.693 --> 08:54.861
will be generously compensated
for your sacrifice.

08:54.895 --> 08:56.563
No! It's... aah...

08:56.597 --> 08:57.731
This wasn't the deal!

08:57.765 --> 08:58.765
- The hit was...
- Was what?

08:58.799 --> 09:00.834
- It was a good hit.
- How do you figure that?

09:00.868 --> 09:02.272
- We got her, didn't we?
- What about him?

09:02.392 --> 09:04.504
No, no. We were told to leave him for...

09:05.773 --> 09:07.540
Ohh, oh.

09:09.877 --> 09:11.778
Didn't she just tell
you it'd be impossible

09:11.812 --> 09:13.837
for you to say nothing forever?

09:15.583 --> 09:16.683
Are you cops?

09:16.717 --> 09:18.254
Please.

09:18.953 --> 09:20.687
In case you hadn't
figured it out already,

09:20.721 --> 09:23.129
your life is in our hands now.

09:23.824 --> 09:27.794
So if I were you, I'd start
trying to live in the moment.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.581
Who's that woman sitting
next to Henry Masters?

09:52.586 --> 09:53.887
- I don't know.
- We'll begin

09:53.921 --> 09:55.722
by standing for "Eternal Father,"

09:55.756 --> 09:59.793
which you will find on
page 352 of your hymnal.

10:12.606 --> 10:18.645
♪ Eternal Father, strong to save ♪

10:18.679 --> 10:24.684
♪ whose arms restrains
the restless wave ♪

10:24.719 --> 10:30.123
♪ who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep ♪

10:30.157 --> 10:36.096
♪ its own appointed bounds to keep ♪

10:36.130 --> 10:42.102
♪ we cry, oh god of majesty ♪

10:42.136 --> 10:49.142
♪ for those in peril on the sea ♪

11:10.498 --> 11:12.488
Cali was my best friend.

11:13.701 --> 11:14.931
My roommate.

11:16.003 --> 11:17.544
My inspiration.

11:18.342 --> 11:20.314
If ever someone was put on this planet

11:20.434 --> 11:23.607
for the sole purpose
of caring for others,

11:24.712 --> 11:26.245
it was Cali Mills.

11:30.718 --> 11:32.652
We got us some tourists in town.

11:32.686 --> 11:34.754
- Where?
- A block from the house.

11:34.789 --> 11:37.023
- Black panel van.
- How many?

11:37.057 --> 11:39.640
Couldn't see. Tinted windows.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.760
Okay.

12:02.216 --> 12:04.517
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:04.552 --> 12:06.886
- Asha.
- Right.

12:10.925 --> 12:12.692
Sorry, um...

12:12.726 --> 12:14.894
I-I just wanted to tell you

12:14.929 --> 12:17.530
that Cali never stopped
talking about you.

12:17.565 --> 12:19.799
- Oh.
- Her war hero brother.

12:19.834 --> 12:23.036
She probably made a lot more
of that than it actually was.

12:23.070 --> 12:24.737
I doubt that.

12:24.772 --> 12:26.039
You realize what you said

12:26.159 --> 12:28.603
in that service there
makes you family now.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.850
- It was okay.
- You kidding?

12:33.080 --> 12:34.948
I don't know how to thank you, dear.

12:34.982 --> 12:36.883
Please, no. It was my honor.

12:36.917 --> 12:39.314
Hey, Mom, whose van is that out there?

12:40.588 --> 12:42.322
I don't know. I've never seen it before.

12:42.356 --> 12:44.724
- Why?
- Excuse me.

12:48.929 --> 12:49.929
Hey!

12:56.270 --> 12:57.770
Looking for me?

12:57.805 --> 12:59.205
Here I am!

13:05.346 --> 13:06.846
Anything you wanna tell me?

13:06.881 --> 13:08.873
This is my fault.

13:09.850 --> 13:12.308
Cali's dead because of me.

13:12.820 --> 13:15.355
- Your fault how?
- They weren't random psychos

13:15.389 --> 13:16.956
on that train, Dad.

13:16.991 --> 13:18.691
They were professionals. Hired killers.

13:18.726 --> 13:20.827
What, so cops? FBI? They're all wrong?

13:20.861 --> 13:22.762
- They're hiding the truth.
- Why would they lie?

13:22.796 --> 13:24.097
I don't know, Dad.

13:24.131 --> 13:25.798
All I do know is I'm not
gonna risk you and Mom

13:25.833 --> 13:26.966
getting caught up in this, too.

13:27.001 --> 13:28.968
Let's just take a breath here, okay?

13:29.003 --> 13:31.037
Talk to Joe Roberts.
Have him post a police detail

13:31.071 --> 13:33.940
outside this house, front
and back 24 hours a day.

13:33.974 --> 13:36.776
- And tell him what?
- Tell him what I just told you.

13:36.810 --> 13:37.810
Tell him to keep it to himself

13:37.845 --> 13:39.679
and make something up.

13:39.713 --> 13:41.814
I need a couple of days, at least.

13:41.849 --> 13:43.683
Where you going?

13:43.717 --> 13:46.602
This is for you and Mom.

13:46.722 --> 13:49.022
I didn't know when would be a
good time to give it to you.

13:49.056 --> 13:51.658
But now...

13:51.692 --> 13:55.628
Tell Mom bye. Tell her I'm sorry.

13:55.663 --> 13:57.130
- And I'm gonna...
- You're gonna what?

14:05.072 --> 14:07.640
Your mother can't lose you too, son.

14:11.211 --> 14:13.178
I understand that, Dad.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.666
Bones tracker's active. On the move.

14:26.786 --> 14:28.854
- Devil's Advocate.
- Make it quick.

14:28.888 --> 14:30.455
Why can't we tell him what we're doing?

14:30.490 --> 14:32.291
Operational Security.

14:32.325 --> 14:33.425
We don't know anything about him.

14:33.459 --> 14:35.093
- We know a little.
- Not enough.

14:35.128 --> 14:36.928
Don't we have a moral duty?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.110
Okay, now you're boring me.

14:38.230 --> 14:39.831
- Moral duty to what?
- To tell him

14:39.865 --> 14:41.900
we're using him as bait
to flush out El Carnicero?

14:41.934 --> 14:43.902
This is Mills' life we're playing with.

14:43.936 --> 14:46.129
Knowing what we now know
from the surviving gunmen?

14:46.249 --> 14:48.850
- Which is?
- I already covered that.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.709
One more time. Just for me.

14:53.212 --> 14:55.680
Carlos Mejia contracted a
hit on Bryan Mills' sister,

14:55.715 --> 14:57.649
so Mills could feel the same pain

14:57.683 --> 14:59.584
Mejia felt after his son was killed.

14:59.619 --> 15:03.722
Now he's hired Mercenaries
to bring Mills to him alive.

15:04.883 --> 15:06.558
See what you did there?

15:06.592 --> 15:09.118
You left out the most important part.

15:10.229 --> 15:12.764
Using Mills gives us our
best opportunity in ten years

15:12.798 --> 15:14.165
to take Mejia alive.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.806
Our only opportunity. And if
he's working with terrorists now,

15:17.926 --> 15:20.272
the only moral duty we have
is to find out who they are,

15:20.306 --> 15:22.873
where they are, and stop them.

15:26.279 --> 15:28.280
Let him go!

15:28.314 --> 15:30.448
You cannot win this!

15:33.386 --> 15:35.120
- Confirmation.
- We got him.

15:53.739 --> 15:55.248
He's home.

16:22.268 --> 16:24.235
Excuse me for looking
out for my little sister.

16:24.270 --> 16:25.770
All grown up now, thanks.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.581
Mama, this is Papa. Comm check.

16:36.616 --> 16:39.451
Got you. Strength ten, Papa.

16:39.485 --> 16:41.252
Landing now. Wait out.

16:41.287 --> 16:42.854
Roger. Standing by.

17:42.214 --> 17:45.283
Same van did a drive-by
eight minutes ago.

17:47.687 --> 17:49.620
We got us two tourists.

17:50.690 --> 17:52.557
Man and a woman.

17:52.591 --> 17:53.825
Stand by.

17:53.859 --> 17:55.935
Looks like we have a ballgame.

18:20.953 --> 18:22.787
Weapon.

18:22.822 --> 18:24.546
- Weapons.
- Two.

18:26.726 --> 18:29.260
Plus silencers. I'm thinking
Heckler & Koch.

18:30.896 --> 18:32.697
It's Koch with a K.

18:32.732 --> 18:35.366
Papa, this is Mama. Hold
position, do not engage.

18:35.401 --> 18:37.535
Say again. Do not engage.

19:05.698 --> 19:07.465
He just took two down.

19:32.043 --> 19:34.859
Who are you?

19:34.894 --> 19:36.427
Who sent you?

19:38.898 --> 19:40.799
Come on.

19:42.802 --> 19:44.302
Tourists heading home.

19:44.336 --> 19:45.937
Moving in.

20:05.658 --> 20:07.792
Mills is in the house,
moving around back.

20:07.827 --> 20:08.827
Wait out.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.836
I'll tell you this:
Dude's got some skills.

21:01.658 --> 21:04.026
- Let him go!
- Aah!

21:06.196 --> 21:07.262
I got you, Mike.

21:07.297 --> 21:08.764
I got you.

21:16.539 --> 21:18.440
Daddy, you're sweating like a pig.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.575
- Oh.
- Someone's calling you.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.444
Oh.

21:22.478 --> 21:24.446
Oh, there is a god after all.

21:27.316 --> 21:29.198
Sorry, sweetheart. It's work.

21:32.321 --> 21:33.703
Bry?

21:33.823 --> 21:35.724
Where are you right now?

21:35.758 --> 21:36.758
I'm at home. Why?

21:36.792 --> 21:38.426
Lianne with you?

21:38.461 --> 21:40.762
Yeah, it's my weekend. Why?

21:40.796 --> 21:42.931
You need to get out
of there... both of you.

21:42.965 --> 21:44.112
Right now.

21:44.232 --> 21:46.200
- _
- DEA agent Mike Hall.

21:47.002 --> 21:48.670
- You there?
- Yeah.

21:48.704 --> 21:50.071
They're coming at me.
It's only a matter of time

21:50.106 --> 21:51.573
before they come for you, too,

21:51.607 --> 21:53.492
- if they're not already.
- Whoa... who's...

21:53.612 --> 21:56.239
- Who's coming at you?
- Who do you think?

21:56.367 --> 21:58.346
So the shooters on
the train, they were...

21:58.381 --> 21:59.414
Exactly.

21:59.449 --> 22:02.384
And they just tried again.
This time at my house.

22:02.418 --> 22:04.152
- You hurt?
- I got one in the leg.

22:04.187 --> 22:05.935
I'll be okay. Went straight through.

22:06.055 --> 22:09.157
- Where are you?
- Some hotel in Jersey.

22:09.192 --> 22:10.325
I'm coming to get you.

22:10.359 --> 22:13.061
No, just get Lianne to safety.

22:13.095 --> 22:15.030
I can make a call. Send a team.

22:15.064 --> 22:17.466
- No team. This is on me.
- That's insane.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.979
Just tell me you're
putting your daughter

22:19.099 --> 22:20.669
in a car right now.

22:22.238 --> 22:24.372
- Okay, fine.
- No buts. Go.

22:24.407 --> 22:25.407
Bye.

22:54.737 --> 22:56.375
He's getting a call.

22:56.873 --> 22:58.783
Not according to this, he's not.

22:58.903 --> 23:00.342
I can hear it vibrating.

23:00.376 --> 23:03.282
It's not his phone. Must be another one.

23:12.987 --> 23:16.568
_

23:26.954 --> 23:29.275
_

23:32.250 --> 23:35.323
_

23:36.726 --> 23:38.420
_

23:50.195 --> 23:51.726
That's his phone.

23:51.761 --> 23:53.762
Incoming call. 703 area code.

23:53.796 --> 23:55.397
You and Lianne on the road yet?

23:55.431 --> 23:57.332
You know I can't just
leave you hanging out there.

23:57.366 --> 23:59.267
I told you, don't worry about me.

23:59.302 --> 24:00.468
It's not happening, buddy.

24:00.503 --> 24:01.636
No can do.

24:01.671 --> 24:03.638
Four years undercover
with these bastards.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.547
I know how they think.

24:06.116 --> 24:07.309
All right.

24:07.343 --> 24:11.513
Motel Biscayne, Route 202, Junction 7.

24:11.547 --> 24:13.315
Okay. Give me five hours.

24:13.349 --> 24:15.815
I'll call you when I'm 30 minutes out.

24:25.877 --> 24:28.044
_

24:31.534 --> 24:33.201
We think out loud here.

24:33.235 --> 24:35.410
You're not at Langley anymore.

24:35.530 --> 24:38.340
Mills just told him his
daughter's life is in danger

24:38.374 --> 24:41.610
and he's more worried about
Mills than he is about her?

24:56.726 --> 24:57.859
Stand by.

24:57.893 --> 25:00.029
He's on the move again.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.650
_

25:31.997 --> 25:33.219
_

25:47.243 --> 25:50.011
Aah! Bryan...

25:50.368 --> 25:51.368
"K"?

25:53.315 --> 25:55.216
How long have you been their bitch?

25:55.251 --> 25:57.419
I don't expect you to understand.

25:57.453 --> 25:58.553
Or had you already switched sides

25:58.587 --> 26:00.288
back when you were undercover?

26:00.322 --> 26:02.424
Understand? Is that what you just said?

26:02.458 --> 26:04.559
Look, I'm sorry about your sister.

26:04.593 --> 26:05.860
But they threatened to kill my daughter!

26:05.895 --> 26:08.396
My daughter, Bryan! Lianne!

26:13.469 --> 26:16.037
You really want to know
when my cover was blown?

26:16.072 --> 26:18.039
When you and the Colombians
screwed the pooch on that raid.

26:18.074 --> 26:19.641
Where is he?

26:19.675 --> 26:22.310
Are you serious? Mejia?

26:22.344 --> 26:24.612
You honestly think I know
where Carlos Mejia is?

26:24.647 --> 26:26.548
I think you can do better than that.

26:26.582 --> 26:28.550
My only contact with
the cartel is a lawyer.

26:28.584 --> 26:30.418
- Where?
- New York.

26:30.453 --> 26:32.754
New York it is, then.

26:36.358 --> 26:37.586
Who's that?

26:38.527 --> 26:40.929
You didn't think they'd
be all over my ass, too?

26:40.963 --> 26:43.498
Who do you think you're
dealing with here, Bryan?

26:44.633 --> 26:46.735
The exit is that way.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.090
We're not getting out of here alive.

27:42.124 --> 27:43.925
- You know that, right?
- I need your tie.

27:43.959 --> 27:45.625
- What?
- Your tie.

28:03.374 --> 28:05.508
How long do you think you
can keep running, Bryan?

28:05.542 --> 28:07.543
A day? Two? A week?

28:09.713 --> 28:12.682
One man against the resources
of an entire cartel?

28:37.107 --> 28:38.941
- Interesting.
- What?

28:38.976 --> 28:40.610
They're not shooting.

29:04.668 --> 29:06.736
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

29:06.770 --> 29:08.738
You can't go down there!

29:43.207 --> 29:45.559
You never met my sister, did you?

29:50.090 --> 29:52.515
She was something, let me tell you.

29:57.554 --> 29:59.255
Beautiful.

30:01.558 --> 30:02.959
Kind.

30:05.129 --> 30:06.425
Smart.

30:25.649 --> 30:29.725
I pray you never have to make
the kind of choice I had to make.

30:30.254 --> 30:32.288
And I mean that, Bry.

30:34.758 --> 30:37.226
My advice? Don't ever have kids.

30:40.230 --> 30:42.298
Especially not a daughter.

31:20.571 --> 31:22.418
Mind the third rail.

31:26.743 --> 31:28.611
I don't wanna hear it.

31:28.645 --> 31:30.713
I just want you gone.

32:07.618 --> 32:08.996
Right here.

32:10.187 --> 32:12.588
Pretty sure you've been
told, on pain of death,

32:12.623 --> 32:14.290
to take me alive.

32:14.324 --> 32:16.305
Or I'd be dead by now.

32:16.425 --> 32:18.294
I'm not spending the rest of my life

32:18.328 --> 32:20.162
running from you people.

32:20.197 --> 32:21.964
Throwing down my weapon now.

33:05.809 --> 33:06.960
Not good.

33:07.878 --> 33:09.812
You mean the phone?

33:14.718 --> 33:17.386
- Bad news.
- Do I know you?

33:17.421 --> 33:20.356
- They took your daughter.
- The cartel.

33:20.390 --> 33:22.024
- How do you know?
- You really wanna stand here,

33:22.059 --> 33:23.693
wasting time, talking about
everything we know?

33:23.727 --> 33:25.361
Get your phone out, numb nuts.

33:25.395 --> 33:27.463
Your phone. Get it out now.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.300
That was her school calling you.

33:31.335 --> 33:33.402
Seven times.

33:33.437 --> 33:35.871
Patch in Echelon. Action NSA and FBI.

33:35.906 --> 33:38.007
Langley, info only.

33:38.041 --> 33:40.676
Done, done, and almost done.

33:40.711 --> 33:42.778
Okay. Make the call.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.915
This is your one shot to get her back.

33:45.949 --> 33:47.850
Do you understand?

33:47.884 --> 33:49.051
Yeah.

33:57.894 --> 33:58.894
Here we go.

33:58.895 --> 34:01.397
Agent Hall. To what
do I owe the pleasure?

34:01.431 --> 34:03.733
- They took my daughter.
- Excuse me?

34:03.767 --> 34:06.478
You heard. I did everything
that was asked of me.

34:06.598 --> 34:08.036
Hold on, hold on. This
is not a secure line.

34:08.071 --> 34:10.438
You're gonna call your client
and get my daughter back.

34:10.474 --> 34:12.341
Right now.

34:12.376 --> 34:14.210
Or I hand myself in and you're in

34:14.244 --> 34:16.245
a Rikers jumpsuit by tonight.

34:19.567 --> 34:21.384
- Now what?
- We're the ones

34:21.418 --> 34:22.752
who took your daughter.

34:22.786 --> 34:24.887
- She's fine.
- You, on the other hand,

34:24.920 --> 34:26.938
we can stick a fork in.

34:54.583 --> 34:57.319
- Yeah.
- I need to talk to my client.

34:57.354 --> 34:58.219
He's not here yet.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.556
- What's his ETA?
- Imminent.

35:00.590 --> 35:02.124
- Meaning?
- Soon.

35:02.159 --> 35:04.794
- Thank you, I meant...
- He's in the air.

35:04.828 --> 35:06.128
- Okay.
- Don't hang up.

35:06.163 --> 35:08.798
- Just a couple of more seconds.
- Are you in radio contact?

35:08.832 --> 35:09.832
Strict radio silence.

35:09.833 --> 35:11.500
He contacts me first. Why?

35:11.535 --> 35:12.935
There a problem?

35:12.969 --> 35:14.170
Potentially.

35:14.204 --> 35:15.204
That affects his visit?

35:15.205 --> 35:17.406
Will you break radio
silence if I say yes?

35:17.441 --> 35:20.242
No, I just wouldn't turn
on the lights on the runway.

35:20.277 --> 35:21.944
Is that what you're saying I should do?

35:21.978 --> 35:22.978
Got it.

35:24.181 --> 35:26.916
Just have him call me when he lands.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.518
Eyes and ears on the
lawyer. Reroute all calls.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.711
You killed my son.

36:47.564 --> 36:50.132
And you killed my sister.

36:53.236 --> 36:54.236
Yes.

37:05.415 --> 37:07.162
Yes, I did.

37:11.502 --> 37:13.292
Give me the 22 blade.

37:20.481 --> 37:22.749
Your son died

37:22.783 --> 37:25.836
holding a gun to the
head of a DEA agent.

37:26.354 --> 37:29.556
My sister died defenseless.

37:29.590 --> 37:31.758
And innocent.

37:31.792 --> 37:34.279
So what kind of a man, I wonder,

37:35.629 --> 37:37.564
does that make you?

37:42.536 --> 37:44.382
It's just as I figured.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.653
But I had to see it for myself.

37:51.645 --> 37:53.424
The eyes of a coward.

38:05.490 --> 38:07.173
Take him down, now.

38:26.681 --> 38:27.748
Hurry up!

38:51.673 --> 38:52.820
Back off!

38:53.542 --> 38:54.888
Back off.

38:55.544 --> 38:57.566
Back off or he dies.

38:58.847 --> 39:01.649
I'm already dead. Take him down.

39:03.685 --> 39:05.653
They can't.

39:05.687 --> 39:06.972
Can you?

39:08.256 --> 39:10.191
I'm no use to them dead.

39:10.225 --> 39:11.392
- Do it now!
- Let him go!

39:11.426 --> 39:12.827
He killed my son!

39:16.076 --> 39:17.456
For my sister.

39:19.634 --> 39:20.634
Ahh!

39:22.571 --> 39:24.705
Mama, this is Papa. Target secured.

39:24.739 --> 39:25.739
Alive and kicking. Over.

39:25.740 --> 39:27.575
Mama Roger. What about Mills?

39:27.609 --> 39:29.009
Over.

39:42.557 --> 39:45.139
Those are ice chips in that blue cup.

39:52.434 --> 39:55.022
You were at my sister's funeral.

39:55.303 --> 39:57.067
Yes, I was.

39:58.740 --> 40:00.067
Who are you?

40:02.611 --> 40:05.256
The man who shot you works for me.

40:07.649 --> 40:09.049
Where am I?

40:09.084 --> 40:11.644
Buffalo Presbyterian. Trauma wing.

40:15.624 --> 40:18.292
Do you understand why you were shot?

40:21.630 --> 40:23.675
He killed my sister.

40:30.805 --> 40:32.673
My name is Christina Hart.

40:32.707 --> 40:34.775
I'm a Deputy Director
with Special Portfolio,

40:34.809 --> 40:37.612
at the Office of the Director
of National Intelligence.

40:38.108 --> 40:39.778
You used me.

40:40.815 --> 40:43.083
I report to the Director
of National Intelligence,

40:43.118 --> 40:46.576
the National Security Council,
and the President.

40:47.389 --> 40:50.291
And now you're gonna tell
me none of this ever happened.

40:50.325 --> 40:54.662
My portfolio is an
emergency covert action team.

40:54.696 --> 40:55.997
Who shot me?

40:56.031 --> 40:57.698
Who saved your life?

41:03.105 --> 41:05.412
Tell me what you believe in, Bryan.

41:07.042 --> 41:09.710
Because what I see is a man who is wired

41:09.745 --> 41:11.479
to protect others.

41:11.513 --> 41:14.248
It's how you're built, it's who you are.

41:14.283 --> 41:16.217
It's why you tackled
those gunmen on the train

41:16.251 --> 41:19.320
in the first place... to protect
those 93 other passengers

41:19.354 --> 41:21.389
in that car.

41:22.457 --> 41:24.413
I just did what I did.

41:26.861 --> 41:28.963
But when you failed to
protect your own sister...

41:29.083 --> 41:32.633
- Who the hell are you to...
- Tell me that's not how you felt.

41:38.173 --> 41:40.191
It's how I still feel.

41:44.713 --> 41:47.047
Listen, taking Carlos Mejia alive

41:47.082 --> 41:49.016
is vital to national security.

41:49.050 --> 41:51.652
But acting on the intelligence
that he will share with us,

41:51.686 --> 41:53.020
make no mistake, is where we're really

41:53.054 --> 41:55.055
gonna earn our money.

42:00.929 --> 42:02.997
You're recruiting me.

42:10.905 --> 42:12.746
And if I say no?

42:17.212 --> 42:18.545
Then, yeah, you're right.

42:18.580 --> 42:20.547
None of this ever happened.

42:24.919 --> 42:27.138
And Cali died for nothing.
