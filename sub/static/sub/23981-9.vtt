WEBVTT

00:13.763 --> 00:14.681
Hey!

00:25.108 --> 00:26.151
Pretty funny.

00:26.693 --> 00:30.447
-Oh.
-Yes.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.615
Fuck up.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.332
I love this. What do you think?

00:41.750 --> 00:42.584
I like it.

00:43.042 --> 00:46.212
Be honest. When we first met,
did you think I was a bad dresser?

00:46.629 --> 00:48.298
No, I didn't think you were
a bad dresser.

00:48.381 --> 00:51.593
I just thought you hadn't bought
any new clothes since middle school.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.264
Well, you should talk.

00:56.347 --> 00:59.392
When we first met, you were wearing
a swimsuit on dry land.

00:59.476 --> 01:03.229
Uh, you loved my bathing suit, landlubber.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.230
Yeah.

01:04.314 --> 01:07.150
When we first met, no joke,
I thought you were Hungarian.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.068
No.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.820
I remember being surprised
that you spoke English.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.032
-Kidding.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.617
Oh, it's a joke.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.828
But I do remember the first moment
I was, like, into you.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.456
-Mm-hmm.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.333
Oh, I wanna hear about this.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.002
You were helping Bertie
carry her dresser into the house.

01:26.085 --> 01:28.171
I saw your arms
and thought they looked sexy.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.590
And I was like, "Yeah,
I'd fuck this guy if he was into it."

01:30.673 --> 01:31.883
-Mm-hmm.

01:31.966 --> 01:35.428
Oh, my God. I had no idea.
I should've made my first move.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.806
And I thought you were so nice.
You were helping Bertie--

01:37.889 --> 01:40.350
Okay, I don't need to hear that.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.561
I get the nice thing enough.
Just objectify me. Please. I love it.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.479
Sure.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.190
So, stud, you gonna wear
this jacket tonight?

01:47.273 --> 01:50.527
I don't know.
Is it too cool?

01:50.610 --> 01:53.446
I feel like I'm trying too hard.
That's my nightmare.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.616
Your dumb movie title band
is playing a live gig.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.244
This may never happen again.
You have to look good.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.038
I know. It's just when I was shooting
my scene with Arya,

02:02.122 --> 02:05.959
I was kind of a dick on set
with my friends, so I don't wanna roll up

02:06.042 --> 02:09.546
wearing a new jacket and have
them be like, "Who's this asshole?"

02:09.629 --> 02:11.506
I'm sure they're over it.
If not, fuck 'em.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.591
Conflict is the cornerstone
of any good band,

02:13.675 --> 02:15.426
like Metallica or the Spice Girls.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.594
It's true.

02:16.678 --> 02:21.391
Okay, final verdict.
Do I buy this jacket?

02:21.474 --> 02:22.976
Yes, you buy this jacket,

02:23.059 --> 02:25.979
and I buy a pair of sunglasses
that I do not need. Hmm?

02:26.062 --> 02:27.897
-All right.
-Yeah.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.544
How about this

02:49.627 --> 02:50.837
Way too somber.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.506
I'm looking at that,
I wanna slit my wrists.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.509
What do you want your suitcase
to say about you?

02:56.593 --> 03:00.638
I want my luggage to say,
"Hey, Cruikshanks,

03:00.722 --> 03:04.392
I'm an adult with luggage,
and I got my shit together."

03:04.475 --> 03:07.145
And then it can just stop talking
after that.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.730
Are you scared of your family?

03:08.813 --> 03:10.064
No.

03:10.148 --> 03:14.777
I mean, just not super stoked
about taking this trip.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.446
Might have been nice if you had backup.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.114
What?

03:18.656 --> 03:20.533
It's nothing.
Just think it's a little weird.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.702
No, I didn't hear you. What'd you say?

03:22.785 --> 03:25.413
It's a little weird you didn't invite me
to meet your family.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.999
We've been together for a while.
You met my dad.

03:28.082 --> 03:29.542
Oh.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.503
I'm sorry. I just...

03:32.587 --> 03:37.175
I bought the ticket before you and me
were, you know, hot and heavy.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.303
Plus, I don't even think
you'd want to go, Mickey.

03:40.386 --> 03:44.432
It's going to be, like, five days.
And it's super, super boring.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.143
It's like every boring thing
mushed together.

03:47.227 --> 03:51.272
It's South Dakota and family
and church and relatives

03:51.356 --> 03:54.776
and anniversary parties
and compact rental cars--

03:54.859 --> 03:57.612
You don't have to pile it on.
It's not that big of a deal.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.240
Would've been nice to be invited.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.117
Maybe I'm crazy,
but I thought we were there.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.329
Well, I think we are there. I just...

04:06.412 --> 04:09.958
I want you to meet my parents
and my siblings.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.919
You don't have to meet
all of my stupid cousins.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.421
Heather's pretty cool, actually.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.717
It's fine. You can drop it.
I'll meet them some other time.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.885
Okay.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.057
Hey, look at this. What? Hold on.

04:26.975 --> 04:30.561
What's this car doing
in the luggage section?

04:30.645 --> 04:31.854
Little weird?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.360
Then it's like...

04:41.489 --> 04:42.532
Doin' a little reverse.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.702
-Oh.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.122
Sorry. I was just goofin',
trying to make my girlfriend laugh.

04:49.914 --> 04:50.748
It's not working.

04:51.749 --> 04:52.750
Yeah, I know.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.682
Hey. Look at that.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.351
Little fruit cart. Got mangoes.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.270
-You love a mango.
-Yeah.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.480
Yeah? Let me get you a mango. Okay.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.151
Thank you. Thanks.

05:18.776 --> 05:19.819
How is it

05:20.320 --> 05:22.280
-It's delicious. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.367
Ah!

05:26.451 --> 05:29.412
There's an open house.
You wanna go check it out?

05:29.495 --> 05:32.665
-Yeah, sure.
-Could be a little fun adventure.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.301
Okay. Yes.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.720
Oh, hi, there. I'm Angela.

05:45.803 --> 05:46.804
-Welcome.
Hello.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.890
If you wouldn't mind, please put these on.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.184
-They just redid the floors.
-Sure.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.061
Before you look around, please sign in.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.190
All right.

05:59.233 --> 06:03.029
My name is Genevieve Vavance...

06:03.821 --> 06:06.824
and I still have an AOL e-mail address.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.743
You are Bastian. No last name.

06:08.826 --> 06:09.952
Whoa.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.289
Holy shit! Double sinks!

06:13.372 --> 06:14.957
Oh, my God. I love it.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.878
God, if we lived here... Oh, God,
we'd be living the high life, you know?

06:18.961 --> 06:20.880
I'd set down my toothbrush, I'd be like,

06:20.963 --> 06:25.384
"Mickey, why don't we invite
the Cunninghams over for dinner?"

06:25.968 --> 06:28.888
Shit. Angela already hates us.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.265
Okay, I'll do this.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.059
There we go. Nobody will ever know.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.811
Double sinks.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.604
No, I'm addicted to my phone.

06:36.687 --> 06:40.441
I'll text myself a reminder or something,
and then when my phone buzzes,

06:40.525 --> 06:43.486
I get so excited
'cause I'm that desperate to text.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.154
-I 100% get that.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.989
When you were telling the story

06:47.073 --> 06:48.741
and you said your phone buzzed,

06:48.825 --> 06:50.952
-I got excited.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.169
Clearly, I'm still smoking.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.965
It's just one too many things to quit
in a year.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.719
And any negative thing you can say,
I've already thought.

07:08.803 --> 07:13.182
Hey, no, don't worry about it.
You'll quit when you're ready. It's fine.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.726
Yeah, I figured I've been smoking
since I was 15,

07:15.810 --> 07:17.562
-Mm-hmm.

07:17.645 --> 07:21.732
Yeah. And, hey, just so you know,
I'm here to talk about your sobriety

07:21.816 --> 07:25.153
as much or as little as you want to, so...

07:25.236 --> 07:26.195
Thank you.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.950
There is one thing I could talk about.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.034
Okay.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.580
-So things are going really well.
-Mm-hmm.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.624
And then, there was that whole
Dr. Greg meltdown,

07:38.708 --> 07:40.710
and I went to this bar
with Truman and Stella

07:40.793 --> 07:42.503
and I ordered a drink.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.214
Oh, wow.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.717
Now, before you get worried,
I did not drink it.

07:48.259 --> 07:52.513
-Okay.
-But I really, really thought about it.

07:54.891 --> 07:59.896
Your sobriety is the most important thing,
so I'm glad you didn't drink.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.398
Yeah. Me, too.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.946
Uh-oh.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.949
Ugh!
-Somebody ain't happy.

08:12.033 --> 08:17.205
Come on. She needs us here to make it seem
like this is some kind of hot property.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.957
How much, uh, do you think
this place costs, anyway?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.794
$1.2 million.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.505
Wow.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.467
You know, I could afford that

08:29.550 --> 08:32.887
if I did every single thing differently
over the last 15 years.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.848
Never say never. I believe in you.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.643
Maybe one day
we could afford this place together.

08:38.726 --> 08:39.727
Yeah.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.979
I shouldn't have said that, should I?

08:42.063 --> 08:43.147
-No.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.732
No. No, no, no. I...

08:44.815 --> 08:51.572
Honestly, I'm not opposed to... you know,
moving in sometime, together. Sometime.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.201
Yeah. I've thought about it.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.037
So neither of us are opposed.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.874
-Let's get out of here.
-Okay.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.796
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't ask you
to go to South Dakota.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.924
I should have, and I'm sorry.
I want you to come.

09:10.007 --> 09:10.883
-Don't worry.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.803
No. Don't worry. It's okay. We're past it.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.680
No, I was being so stupid.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.975
I was in my head with my family.
I truly want you to come.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.393
Will you come

09:20.476 --> 09:22.436
You don't have to invite me
'cause you feel bad.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.273
-I'm not.
-Hmm. No, you were right.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.400
I do want to meet your parents
and your siblings,

09:27.483 --> 09:29.610
but not every Cruikshank in America.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.530
And five days is a really long time.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.117
Yeah. No. That makes sense.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.285
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.872
You ready for your big show tonight?

09:41.956 --> 09:44.458
-Yeah, fuck yeah.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.086
Actually, no. I don't think
we're ready to perform live.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.963
-This shouldn't be happening.
-Oh.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.591
Well, if it really starts to suck,

09:51.674 --> 09:55.845
I can always just yell, "Fire,"
and take off my top.

09:55.928 --> 09:56.846
-Perfect.
-Okay.

09:56.929 --> 09:57.888
Thank you.

10:11.193 --> 10:13.696
Hey, uh, you want a cigarette
before we go in?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.865
Do you want me to have one?

10:15.948 --> 10:21.203
Uh... Yeah, I'm just not really ready
to face Ruby and Wade yet.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.956
They saw me go nuts on that shoot,

10:24.040 --> 10:27.460
and our group-text chain
has pretty much gone silent.

10:27.543 --> 10:30.755
I've learned, if you own it
and you say you're sorry,

10:30.838 --> 10:31.839
they usually forgive you.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.550
Yeah. I mean, that makes sense.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.010
You don't even have to mean it.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.513
-No, I mean it.
-Oh, great. That'll help sell it.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.351
I'll be there if you get nervous.
You can squeeze my hand.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.103
-Okay.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.440
Yeah. Be prepared.
I'm gonna squeeze the shit out of it.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.817
They're not gonna start
any trouble with me there.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.402
Those guys are scared of me.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.821
No. Yeah.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.327
Hey, everybody.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.703
Hi.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.704
Nice jacket.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.539
Oh, thank you.
-All right.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.957
You guys ready to shred?

11:07.041 --> 11:09.460
-Oh, ready to shred. Ready to shred.
-Yeah.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.505
Wait, guys. I just wanted to say,

11:12.588 --> 11:15.883
as far as my tantrum on set
with Arya and stuff,

11:15.966 --> 11:17.593
I feel really crummy--

11:17.676 --> 11:19.220
Gus, I'm gonna stop you right there.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.473
Come on, whatever happened on set,
let's leave it on set.

11:22.556 --> 11:26.936
I feel like there was an apology coming.
I'd like to hear that.

11:28.854 --> 11:29.855
-Okay.
-Mmm.

11:29.939 --> 11:34.610
Uh, yeah, I mean, you guys
have helped me out so much,

11:34.693 --> 11:37.488
and I know I lost my temper there
a couple of times,

11:37.571 --> 11:39.407
so I am sorry.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.617
Well, thank you.

11:42.743 --> 11:47.164
I don't accept your apology.
Uh, my feelings are still hurting.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.041
Seriously?

11:49.834 --> 11:52.086
Not seriously, Mickey.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.964
See, just kidding. Let's have a fun show.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.927
All right, I'll leave you rockers to it.
I'm not in this band. Bye.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.680
-Okay. Bye.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.306
Oh, yeah.
Yes, good idea.

12:04.390 --> 12:08.269
Oh, hey, yeah. I do not think
that we should open with "Gran Torino."

12:08.352 --> 12:10.312
I agree.
We should not start with a ballad.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.564
We'll put the crowd to sleep.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.942
I picked up a few more days
of extra work on <i>Witchita</i>.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.653
That's great. I'm proud of you.

12:17.736 --> 12:22.324
Yeah, they need me on set at seven a.m.,
so I can't go too crazy tonight.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.538
God, listen to me. "On set."
Can you believe it?

12:27.621 --> 12:29.039
No, I cannot.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.294
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
Can I get you a drink?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.296
Oh, no, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.505
Are you sure?

12:36.964 --> 12:38.132
I want to do more stuff for you.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.968
Like buying you drinks
and buying you jewelry.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.845
Don't buy me jewelry. Please.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.638
Open a savings account.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.183
Hey, buddy.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.268
Hey! Hey.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.438
-Hey.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.231
Hey, what's up?

12:54.315 --> 12:57.193
-I don't know. They should.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.696
-You guys know each other.
-Yeah, we've met.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.156
-Hi, Bertie.
-Hello.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.411
Yeah.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.081
So, um,
when I was coming over here tonight,

13:11.165 --> 13:12.625
I saw a big accident on the road.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.584
Oh, no.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.420
I think it was very serious.
There was two ambulances.

13:16.504 --> 13:20.090
And, um, I thought there was
some kind of spaghetti involved,

13:20.174 --> 13:23.427
but I think it had come
from inside the man on the motorcycle.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.762
And, um...

13:24.845 --> 13:26.347
Hey! What are you guys talking about?

13:26.430 --> 13:31.060
Mickey! Could I ask you to join me outside
for a meeting of the Chamber of Champions?

13:31.143 --> 13:32.061
Sure.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.773
That's what I call our apartment.
It's just a fun thing I do.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.024
I don't know why I do it.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.901
Yes, I do. It's 'cause we're champions.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.903
-Let's go.
-Okay. Bye.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.573
-Oh, no, I'm good.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.116
Oh.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.369
I'll get you another one.
You can double fist it!

13:48.452 --> 13:50.204
-Cool.
Yeah, cool.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.373
I'm sleeping with Chris.

13:52.915 --> 13:53.874
What?

13:53.958 --> 13:57.670
We started hanging out.
First, it was just an emotional affair,

13:57.753 --> 14:00.839
but then things took a turn,
and now it's a very physical affair.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.925
And now I really like him.

14:03.008 --> 14:07.263
What is it about our apartment
that turns us into philandering bad girls?

14:07.346 --> 14:08.889
What should I do?

14:09.932 --> 14:13.811
Well,
I never told Gus about Dustin.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.397
But if you have feelings for Chris,

14:16.480 --> 14:19.233
maybe you should be honest with Randy
and cut things off.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.651
But he's so sensitive.

14:20.734 --> 14:24.697
Last night, I came in and he was crying
to an episode of <i>Storage Wars.</i>

14:25.281 --> 14:27.157
That's not a reason to stay with him.

14:27.908 --> 14:31.787
Ugh. This situation is so fucked.
I'm fucked.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.458
-Oh, yeah.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.710
-You seem sort of...
-Yeah.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.587
-...out of it or something.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.921
It's okay if something's wrong.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.798
-No, not at all. Yeah.
-Okay.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.924
Uh, this will be fun tonight.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.302
-Yeah. Yeah, I can't wait. Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.096
You excited about going back home?

14:49.179 --> 14:53.392
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, my parents' 40th anniversary.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.937
You know that's going to be
a fucking wild party.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.439
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.150
Hats off to Mark and Vicki, man.
Those crazy kids.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.027
Yeah. Let's hear it for those nutty kids.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.528
They stuck it out.
-Mm-hmm.

15:05.112 --> 15:08.532
Hey, and Mickey's finally going to meet
the Cruikshanks, huh?

15:08.616 --> 15:09.617
Yeah.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.118
Well, uh...

15:11.201 --> 15:13.162
No. I mean, she's not.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.915
I invited her,
but she's not gonna come.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.333
-Oh, bummer, man. Huh.
-Yeah.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.336
I don't know. Maybe it's for the best.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.755
I don't want her to see
how weird my family is.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.214
Or how weird I am around my family.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.424
It's gonna be a lot.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.842
And Mickey's Mickey, right?

15:26.926 --> 15:29.386
She could totally freak out
your whole family.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.348
Yeah. Yeah.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.644
I mean, you don't have to say that,
but yes.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.187
It's maybe for the best. -But I love her.
-Yeah.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.565
-Oh, yeah, she's the best.
-Yeah.

15:41.649 --> 15:45.986
I'm just saying you could be, like,
playing Scrabble at your kitchen table,

15:46.070 --> 15:49.031
and then she walks in,
bites the head off a bat.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.952
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.375
-Let me get you a drink.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.963
Full disclosure, I'm here
with my boyfriend, and I don't drink.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.840
Okay. Uh, well...

16:06.924 --> 16:10.219
Which one's your boyfriend?
I gotta see if you're making a mistake.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.930
Nice. Uh...

16:14.390 --> 16:16.392
The guy in the military jacket.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.605
Seriously?

16:21.689 --> 16:24.525
The dude who looks like a child's drawing?

16:24.942 --> 16:28.570
Wow. You think you're funny, don't you?
We're done talking.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.160
Oh, my God, it's almost show time!

16:35.244 --> 16:37.621
-Oh, I can't wait.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.373
Did you just take my cigarettes?

16:39.456 --> 16:41.667
-No.
-Yeah, you did. You're lying.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.546
I'm not lying.
Why would I take your Kool Ultra Lights?

16:45.629 --> 16:46.714
I'm not in seventh grade.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.549
You're a really shitty liar.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.551
If she said she didn't take 'em,
she didn't take 'em.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.553
Dude, does this involve you?

16:52.636 --> 16:55.806
Go back to your band,
which I heard sucks, by the way.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.182
Uh, that's bullshit.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.643
This is our first show,
so no one even knows we suck yet.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.853
Prove you didn't take my cigarettes.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.521
-Open your purse.
-Fuck you. No.

17:02.604 --> 17:05.816
-Come on.
-Hey. Get the fuck out of here.

17:05.899 --> 17:06.900
Relax.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.404
No, I'm not going to relax.
Get fucking going, top button.

17:10.487 --> 17:14.033
Whatever. Keep 'em.
I got better shit to do, anyway.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.118
Then go do it!

17:20.748 --> 17:22.291
I did take his cigarettes.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.792
I figured.

17:23.876 --> 17:24.877
Okay.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.838
-See you in a little bit.
-Bye, buddy.

17:27.921 --> 17:31.550
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
We are Roger and The Eberts! And we play theme songs
for movies that don't have them!

17:35.763 --> 17:40.768
So let's start things off right,
with a little visit from the dessert cart.

in years, and I'm not even kidding.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.366
Thanks, Mickey.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.494
I want to go to South Dakota.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.414

in front of your parents?
