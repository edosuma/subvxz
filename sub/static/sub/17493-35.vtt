00:03.920 --> 00:05.320
Sarah and Duck.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.320
QUACK!

00:08.800 --> 00:10.760
QUACK!

00:12.000 --> 00:13.880
QUACK!

00:15.880 --> 00:17.480
Today, Sarah and Duck

00:17.480 --> 00:18.880
are in the garden,

00:18.880 --> 00:22.760
checking that the
hedges are all in good order.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.040
Leaf.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.560
Leaf.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.240
Ooh!

00:36.240 --> 00:37.280
Tiny.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.000
Hello.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.280
# Andiamo! #

00:43.280 --> 00:44.920
Wow!

00:44.920 --> 00:46.720
How'd you do that?

00:46.720 --> 00:49.400
I don't think that was the aphid.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.520
Hmm...

00:50.520 --> 00:52.600
A-phid?

00:52.600 --> 00:56.160
# Andiamo interrogare. #

00:56.160 --> 00:58.280
Ooh.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.800
Uh, bye, Aphid.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.400
# L'amore

01:03.400 --> 01:07.000
# Duck e Sarah. #

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Take a note, Duck.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.920
Hedge sings...

01:10.920 --> 01:12.120
Woobalilly.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.800
# La-a-a-a-a-a-more... #

01:15.800 --> 01:17.840
Hmm, I'm going in.

01:17.840 --> 01:24.880
# La-a-a-a-a-a-a-amore... #

01:24.880 --> 01:27.000
QUACK!

01:27.000 --> 01:28.640
GIGGLING

01:28.640 --> 01:31.560
Ooh, it's laughing.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.120
I'm not sure that's the hedge.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.200
Oh.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.920
Hello, Ribbon Sisters.

01:39.920 --> 01:42.520
Did you know the hedge could sing?

01:42.520 --> 01:44.040
There. There.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.560
# Andiamo, andiamo

01:47.560 --> 01:51.040
# Andiamo interrogare. #

01:51.040 --> 01:52.920
I think that's someone

01:52.920 --> 01:54.160
singing opera

01:54.160 --> 01:55.520
over the hedge.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.120
Oh...

01:57.120 --> 01:58.440
Hedge opera.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.160
W-well, sort of.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.000
Need to look it up.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.640
Bye, Ribbon Sisters. Bye.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.280
Come on, Duck.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.840
Hed-ge o-per-a...

02:17.840 --> 02:22.120
You know, I'm not sure how common
"hedge opera" is...

02:22.120 --> 02:24.640
Perhaps just start with opera?

02:24.640 --> 02:28.240
OK. O-per-a. Search.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.160
Whoa-ah.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.440
LOUD OPERA BLASTS!
QUACK!

02:33.440 --> 02:35.320
Oops, sorry, Duck.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.400
Mmm...

02:38.400 --> 02:39.480
This one?

02:39.480 --> 02:41.400
SOFTER OPERA MUSIC

02:41.400 --> 02:43.120
Oh...

02:48.480 --> 02:54.120
FAST OPERA MUSIC

02:54.120 --> 02:56.520
Yes. This one is best.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.000
A fine choice...

02:58.000 --> 03:00.640
# ..inde-e-e-e-d. #

03:00.640 --> 03:02.920
Ooh, I want to do it too.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.080
Why not?

03:05.080 --> 03:07.000
Erm, Sarah?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.600
Hmm. Where's she off to?

03:08.600 --> 03:11.280
QUACK QUACK?

03:11.280 --> 03:13.840
Ah, your coat and tails.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.240
Er, what are you doing?

03:17.240 --> 03:18.480
Getting ready.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.600
Erm...

03:19.600 --> 03:21.440
The hedge opera. Oh.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.600
Right.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.120
THUD!
QUACK!

03:24.120 --> 03:25.320
I see.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.520
QUACK QUACK!

03:26.520 --> 03:27.840
Good one, Duck.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.960
So.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.000
Ready to give opera a try?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.320
Um... Er...

03:33.320 --> 03:34.640
Yes.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.280
Let's hear it, then.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.040
Er, are you starting off stage?

03:42.560 --> 03:43.880
Fair enough.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.960
Take it away, Sarah.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.800
FAINTLY: # Ah... #

03:47.800 --> 03:50.520
Well, it's a start. Have another go.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.320
# La-a-a, um...

03:52.320 --> 03:54.480
# La-a-a-a. #

03:54.480 --> 03:56.000
Ah, that's better.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.840
Hee hee!

03:57.840 --> 03:59.280
QUACK QUACK!

03:59.280 --> 04:03.360
# Tra-la-li-loo, la-lee-la... #

04:03.360 --> 04:05.040
La?

04:05.040 --> 04:06.760
What's wrong, Sarah?

04:06.760 --> 04:09.400
It's not deep enough.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.120
# De-e-e-e-e-e-e

04:11.120 --> 04:13.440
# Per-r-r-r-r-r-r. #

04:13.440 --> 04:15.440
Hmm.

04:16.920 --> 04:21.120
DEEP OPERA MUSIC

04:21.120 --> 04:23.160
Well, we can't all have

04:23.160 --> 04:25.200
a deep voice like that.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.720
Ooh, we need a different room.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.200
Come on, Duck.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.360
QUACK!

04:32.360 --> 04:34.440
Well, we can certainly try.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.640
Here, Duck?

04:38.640 --> 04:40.480
QUACK!

04:40.480 --> 04:42.440
# La-la-la! #

04:42.440 --> 04:44.200
Hmm...

04:44.200 --> 04:46.000
Ah!

04:46.000 --> 04:47.320
Sarah...?

04:47.320 --> 04:49.400
It's like hedge opera.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.760
Ah. Yes.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.440
# Tri-la-li-la-loo! #

04:53.440 --> 04:54.880
Oops, sorry, Bug.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.080
QUACK QUACK!

05:01.080 --> 05:03.800
Do you really think that will help,
chap?

05:03.800 --> 05:06.160
QUACK!
OK...

05:08.720 --> 05:10.160
# La-la-la... #

05:10.160 --> 05:11.240
Duck!

05:12.960 --> 05:14.720
# La-la-la! #

05:14.720 --> 05:15.760
Nope.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.040
Duck?

05:22.520 --> 05:23.560
Duck?

05:25.920 --> 05:27.320
QUACK QUACK QUACK!

05:27.320 --> 05:29.640
Greedy Duck. Oh!

05:29.640 --> 05:31.160
Good sounds!

05:31.160 --> 05:32.240
Oh!

05:32.240 --> 05:34.520
THUD!
Ow.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.480
Oh...

05:37.480 --> 05:41.320
# Li-la-la-lee-loo-o-o-o... #

05:41.320 --> 05:44.600
Well, it certainly adds something.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.040
Ah. It's not deeper.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.000
No, I'm afraid not.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.600
# Andiamo... #

05:51.600 --> 05:53.400
QUACK QUACK!

05:53.400 --> 05:55.360
# Andiamo interrogare. #

05:56.560 --> 05:58.760
Oh... It's OK, Sarah.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.160
Look, Duck doesn't seem to mind

06:01.160 --> 06:03.680
and his quack isn't very deep at
all.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.920
QUACK QUACK!

06:04.920 --> 06:06.440
# Andiamo... #

06:06.440 --> 06:07.880
QUACK QUACK QUACK!

06:07.880 --> 06:09.560
# Oh, andiamo! #

06:09.560 --> 06:11.600
# Suppose so. #

06:11.600 --> 06:13.280
QUACK QUACK, QUACK QUACK!

06:13.280 --> 06:15.680
# Interrogare. #

06:15.680 --> 06:17.040
Ooh!

06:17.040 --> 06:20.040
QUACK QUACK!
SARAH MIMES: # Andiamo... #

06:20.040 --> 06:22.840
That's quite a voice you've got
there, Sarah.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.600
It's not mine. I borrowed it.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.240
QUACK QUACK, QUACK!

06:27.240 --> 06:28.440
# Oh, andiamo

06:28.440 --> 06:30.080
QUACK QUACK, QUACK QUACK!

06:30.080 --> 06:32.400
# Interrogare... #

06:32.400 --> 06:33.720
Bravo!

06:33.720 --> 06:35.200
GIGGLING

06:35.200 --> 06:37.240
Bravissimo!

06:37.240 --> 06:38.640
QUACK QUACK!

06:38.640 --> 06:40.880
# L'amore...

06:40.880 --> 06:45.440
# Duck e Sarah. #

06:45.440 --> 06:47.000
Sarah and Duck.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.040
QUACK!

06:49.040 --> 06:50.400
Sarah and Duck.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.440
QUACK!

06:52.440 --> 06:53.720
Sarah and Duck.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.800
QUACK!

06:55.800 --> 06:56.960
Sarah and Duck.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.880
QUACK!
