00:00.736 --> 00:03.468
Our guest tonight has a remarkable story.

00:03.746 --> 00:05.380
At age 22, Alice Clark

00:05.414 --> 00:09.116
journeyed to the jungles of
Rwanda where she studied

00:09.150 --> 00:11.485
the mighty silverback gorilla.

00:11.519 --> 00:13.053
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

00:13.087 --> 00:14.321
<i>Alice, they're about to begin.</i>

00:14.356 --> 00:15.322
Where are you?

00:15.357 --> 00:17.124
When she returned to America,

00:17.158 --> 00:19.727
Ms. Clark applied her extensive research

00:19.761 --> 00:21.495
on dominant primates to the alphas

00:21.529 --> 00:23.329
of our urban jungle,

00:23.364 --> 00:26.031
advising some of the
world's most prominent leaders

00:26.066 --> 00:27.500
And their spouses,

00:27.534 --> 00:31.203
which inspired her
latest nonfiction bestseller,

00:31.238 --> 00:34.974
A field
guide to relationships."

00:35.008 --> 00:38.077
Please welcome Alice Clark.

00:44.384 --> 00:47.051
Come on, come on, come on.

01:17.571 --> 01:20.105
You okay?

01:20.139 --> 01:21.758
Yeah. I am. Just...

01:22.540 --> 01:23.414
What?

01:24.293 --> 01:26.053
It's
like he's glaring at me.

01:26.943 --> 01:29.740
What? What do you mean? Linus?

01:29.892 --> 01:30.629
Mm-hmm.

01:31.608 --> 01:32.909
Whenever I come over here,

01:32.944 --> 01:35.045
it feels like he's watching me.

01:35.079 --> 01:37.714
Do you ever notice how his
eyes follow you when you move?

01:37.748 --> 01:40.550
Yeah. I love that. It keeps you on alert.

01:40.551 --> 01:41.885
Yeah, well, Castle,

01:41.953 --> 01:45.326
I'm a cop. I'm always on alert. When
I came home, I just wanna relax.

01:46.418 --> 01:47.165
Not fall asleep.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.140
Staring into the eyes of a hungry lion.

01:49.141 --> 01:50.441
About to pounce.

01:50.674 --> 01:51.236
Wait a minute.

01:54.349 --> 01:55.616
You're not, uh...

01:55.651 --> 01:58.786
You're not asking me to
get rid of Linus, are you?

01:58.820 --> 02:00.486
No, I was... I was just thinking.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.122
That maybe you could
move it to another room.

02:04.559 --> 02:05.926
Another room?

02:07.562 --> 02:09.963
Yeah, like, um...

02:09.997 --> 02:12.098
Maybe your office.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.253
My office?

02:13.267 --> 02:16.602
Beckett. Yes. Okay. We'll be right there.

02:16.917 --> 02:18.690
There's been a murder.

02:19.138 --> 02:21.674
Yeah, of Linus' feelings.

02:24.611 --> 02:26.779
It's just, I bought Linus with
my first royalty check.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.747
From "In a hail of bullets."

02:28.782 --> 02:33.084
He's my totem, wild and untamed, and my bedroom
is my lair.

02:33.118 --> 02:34.518
I know, Castle, but, um,

02:34.553 --> 02:37.288
<i>isn't it kind of our lair now?</i>

02:37.322 --> 02:39.002
But Linus the lion is part of my identity.

02:39.024 --> 02:41.025
You don't wanna strip
me of my identity, do you?

02:41.060 --> 02:43.027
No. You know what?

02:43.062 --> 02:44.495
You're right. I'm sorry.

02:44.529 --> 02:46.163
Um...

02:46.198 --> 02:47.999
I can just stay at my own place.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.367
Thanks. Wait. No. That's not...

02:50.402 --> 02:51.602
So, Ryan, what do we got?

02:51.636 --> 02:55.306
Victim is Alice Amy
Clark, 37, GSW to the chest.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.408
Uh, parking attendant
found her an hour ago.

02:57.442 --> 02:59.710
Apparently, she's some kind of therapist,

02:59.744 --> 03:01.178
has an office here in the building.

03:01.213 --> 03:03.180
Wait. Alice Clark?

03:03.215 --> 03:05.348
<i>Not the Alice Clark?</i>

03:05.382 --> 03:08.085
Relationship guru to the rich and famous?

03:08.119 --> 03:11.521
- A
- field guide to relationships"?

03:11.555 --> 03:14.925
You know her? By reputation only.

03:14.959 --> 03:18.261
She has the idea that, uh, we
can improve our relationships.

03:18.295 --> 03:20.997
By acknowledging our animal nature.

03:21.031 --> 03:24.266
Um... the instinct to
protect and nurture, for example,

03:24.300 --> 03:26.535
by say, offering to share one's lair.

03:26.569 --> 03:28.738
Ah, well, speaking of animal nature,

03:28.772 --> 03:32.174
you should see the inside of her car.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.744
Oh, wow. It's been completely torn apart.

03:34.778 --> 03:36.612
And from the spatter
pattern, it looks like

03:36.646 --> 03:39.014
all of this was done after she was killed.

03:39.048 --> 03:41.282
So they killed her, then
they killed her car.

03:41.316 --> 03:42.717
So they were looking for something.

03:42.752 --> 03:44.519
Yeah, and it wasn't her
wallet, phone, or keys, either.

03:44.553 --> 03:46.220
Killer didn't bother with those.

03:46.255 --> 03:49.791
Or the 10 grand that we
found inside her purse.

03:49.825 --> 03:51.305
That's a lot of walking-around money,

03:51.326 --> 03:52.593
even for a bestselling author.

03:52.628 --> 03:54.327
So if they weren't after the money,

03:54.362 --> 03:56.664
what were they looking for?

03:58.633 --> 04:00.200
When did this happen?

04:00.234 --> 04:01.535
Based on body temp and lividity,

04:01.569 --> 04:04.237
I'd say between 6:00 and 8:00 last night.

04:04.272 --> 04:05.773
Did you get a look at security cams?

04:05.807 --> 04:08.042
Garage doesn't have camera coverage,

04:08.076 --> 04:09.275
but other parts of the building do.

04:09.309 --> 04:10.609
They're pulling tape for us right now.

04:12.479 --> 04:14.080
Somebody calling her?

04:14.114 --> 04:15.815
No, it's some kind of reminder alarm.

04:15.849 --> 04:17.449
Keeps going off every few minutes.

04:17.483 --> 04:20.319
N- F-1-9-4-5.

04:23.623 --> 04:24.590
Esposito's with her assistant upstairs,
he might know.

04:24.624 --> 04:26.792
I don't know anything about it,

04:26.826 --> 04:29.995
but I left the office around
4:30 to go help set up.

04:30.029 --> 04:32.831
When she didn't show, I
knew something was wrong.

04:32.865 --> 04:35.300
Was she expecting anyone after you left?

04:35.334 --> 04:36.534
Any appointments?

04:36.569 --> 04:39.304
No. In fact, she had me cancel
them all for yesterday.

04:39.338 --> 04:40.938
Any reason?

04:40.972 --> 04:43.307
I assume she wanted
time to prep for the lecture.

04:43.341 --> 04:45.309
She spent most of the day in her office.

04:45.343 --> 04:47.945
Only call she took
was from her boyfriend Matt.

04:47.979 --> 04:49.947
Did she mention having
anything of value on her?

04:49.981 --> 04:52.216
Something that someone might
have been looking for?

04:52.250 --> 04:55.720
No. Why do you ask?

05:00.791 --> 05:04.127
The whole place was turned inside
out, just like the car.

05:04.161 --> 05:05.361
And what was taken?

05:05.395 --> 05:06.495
Nothing valuable.

05:06.530 --> 05:07.831
Computers, iPads, artwork...

05:07.865 --> 05:09.766
All the obvious stuff was still there.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.334
So what were they looking for?

05:11.368 --> 05:12.868
I don't know. The assistant said.

05:12.902 --> 05:14.302
That they went through her client files.

05:14.337 --> 05:15.670
Alice counseled some serious VIPs

05:15.705 --> 05:18.173
CEOs, politicians, generals,

05:18.208 --> 05:19.775
and she took very detailed
notes of every session.

05:19.809 --> 05:22.510
The most intimate
details of the world's elite?

05:22.545 --> 05:24.146
People have been killed for a lot less.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.115
Are there any files missing?

05:26.149 --> 05:27.950
Well, the assistant is
combing through everything now,

05:27.984 --> 05:29.383
but it's gonna take some
time. All right.

05:29.417 --> 05:32.220
So I scrubbed her building security video,

05:32.254 --> 05:33.687
and check this out.

05:33.722 --> 05:35.556
This guy went up to Alice's office floor.

05:35.590 --> 05:37.625
Near the tail end of
our time-of-death window,

05:37.659 --> 05:39.827
and he was the only
person up there last night.

05:39.862 --> 05:41.428
Which means he's the only person.

05:41.463 --> 05:43.197
Who could have tossed Alice's place.

05:43.232 --> 05:46.066
Check it out. He's turned
away from the camera every shot.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.001
Hiding his face from us. Th I is our guy.

05:48.035 --> 05:51.704
Detective? Your victim's boyfriend is here.

05:51.739 --> 05:55.475
No. Never seen him before.

05:55.509 --> 05:56.810
And you have no idea.

05:56.844 --> 05:59.179
What he might have been looking for?

05:59.213 --> 06:01.247
This is my fault.

06:01.281 --> 06:04.716
I was supposed to pick her up last night,

06:04.751 --> 06:06.819
but I got held up at work.

06:08.454 --> 06:11.157
Where is it that you work, exactly?

06:11.191 --> 06:15.861
I'm a consultant for an
international aid NGO.

06:15.896 --> 06:18.863
All she did was help people.

06:18.898 --> 06:20.832
Why would anyone wanna kill her?

06:20.866 --> 06:22.233
How did she seem to you lately?

06:22.268 --> 06:23.634
Was there anything to indicate.

06:23.669 --> 06:25.369
She was having any troubles in her life?

06:25.404 --> 06:28.239
No, nothing.

06:28.274 --> 06:31.943
She seemed happy.

06:31.977 --> 06:33.277
And how about her clients?

06:33.311 --> 06:34.791
Was she having difficulty with anyone?

06:34.813 --> 06:36.413
Sometimes.

06:36.447 --> 06:40.951
Uh, the people she
counseled could be aggressive,

06:40.985 --> 06:44.387
demanding, but she liked the challenge...

06:44.422 --> 06:46.556
Taming the wild beast and all that.

06:46.590 --> 06:49.358
Did anyone stand out in particular?

06:49.392 --> 06:54.263
Alice was... discreet about her work.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.868
Though at lunch the other day,

06:58.902 --> 07:03.372
she... seemed a little rattled.

07:03.406 --> 07:06.174
She said she'd received a
call from a pissed-off client.

07:08.044 --> 07:11.779
Like I said, she was discreet.

07:11.814 --> 07:13.048
Okay, thanks.

07:13.082 --> 07:14.782
Hey, listen to this.

07:14.817 --> 07:17.018
"Males of both species
define their territory,

07:17.053 --> 07:20.355
then honor the female by inviting them in."

07:20.389 --> 07:23.958
See, I'm... I'm honoring you
by inviting you into my territory,

07:23.992 --> 07:25.726
and Linus is part of that territory.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.794
And if you
wanna be invited into.

07:27.829 --> 07:30.164
My territory again, you
should probably rethink that.

07:32.734 --> 07:35.602
So CSU just finished with
the car and the office,

07:35.636 --> 07:38.204
and they found no prints and
almost no trace evidence.

07:38.239 --> 07:39.405
It's like...

07:39.439 --> 07:41.407
Both locations have been cleaned.

07:41.441 --> 07:43.910
That and the cameras? This guy's a pro.

07:43.944 --> 07:47.513
Okay, so then why would
a professional assassin.

07:47.547 --> 07:48.882
Murder a therapist?

07:48.916 --> 07:52.085
Because as a therapist, she'd be privy.

07:52.119 --> 07:53.759
To her clients' deepest, darkest secrets...

07:53.786 --> 07:55.153
Secrets so explosive,

07:55.188 --> 07:57.990
that simply hearing
them ensured her demise.

07:58.024 --> 08:00.658
All right, what kind of
secrets? Well... nuclear launch codes,

08:00.693 --> 08:02.127
that the moon walk was a fake,

08:02.161 --> 08:03.395
that Roswell wasn't, secret location.

08:03.429 --> 08:06.298
Of the cryogenically frozen body of...

08:06.332 --> 08:09.433
Well, um... Boyfriend checks out.

08:09.467 --> 08:12.069
Called his office. They
verified that he was working.

08:12.104 --> 08:13.371
All last night, but Alice definitely.

08:13.405 --> 08:15.239
Tumbled down the rabbit hole to shadyland.

08:15.274 --> 08:16.673
That alert on her phone...

08:16.708 --> 08:19.310
N- F-1-9-4-5... It's
a tail number.

08:19.344 --> 08:21.178
Of a private jet that she chartered.

08:21.213 --> 08:24.615
She chartered a private jet? To where?

08:24.649 --> 08:26.316
Well, I contacted the
pilot out of Teterboro.

08:26.350 --> 08:27.784
He said Alice paid him 50 grand in cash.

08:27.818 --> 08:29.819
To be on standby with a full tank of gas,

08:29.853 --> 08:31.321
destination unknown.

08:31.355 --> 08:32.789
She knew she was in trouble.

08:32.823 --> 08:34.490
She was getting ready to disappear.

08:34.525 --> 08:37.126
Okay, she's a bestselling
author with a flourishing career.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.962
If she was in trouble, why didn't she.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.297
Just call the police or her boyfriend?

08:40.331 --> 08:42.831
Why would she charter a jet?

08:42.865 --> 08:45.267
Hey, guys? We got something.

08:45.302 --> 08:46.502
Canvass turned up a news vendor.

08:46.536 --> 08:47.803
Who saw our suspect leave Alice's building.

08:47.837 --> 08:49.271
And drive off in a blue van.

08:49.306 --> 08:50.806
But
the reason he remembers our guy.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.408
Is because his van was
parked behind a woman.

08:52.442 --> 08:53.442
Who was cursing out a parking officer.

08:53.476 --> 08:54.676
For giving her a ticket.

08:54.710 --> 08:57.678
Luckily, traffic
enforcement's vehicles are mounted.

08:57.712 --> 08:59.847
With cameras that snap
photos of each parked car.

08:59.881 --> 09:01.515
It's how they catch meter cheaters.

09:01.550 --> 09:03.384
Here's the ticketed car.

09:03.419 --> 09:05.686
And here's your murder
suspect's blue van.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.355
It's registered to a Manhattan Raptor, Inc.

09:08.389 --> 09:09.522
We get an address?

09:15.263 --> 09:17.097
Hands! Show me your hands!

09:18.732 --> 09:20.700
Hey! Hey! Hey!

09:20.734 --> 09:22.234
Go around back.

09:22.269 --> 09:25.171
Open up!

09:25.205 --> 09:28.474
Go!

09:28.508 --> 09:31.177
Let me see those hands!

09:31.211 --> 09:34.580
I said show me those hands!

09:45.537 --> 09:46.737
Well?

09:46.738 --> 09:48.792
He didn't have an ID on him or in his van,

09:48.793 --> 09:51.451
but we did find an interesting
match on his fingerprints.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.809
That's Barrett Hawke?

09:54.843 --> 09:56.844
Barrett Hawke? As in the legendary fixer?

09:56.878 --> 09:58.680
He's been sweeping the dirt
of New York's rich and famous.

09:58.714 --> 10:01.982
Under the rug for over a decade.

10:02.017 --> 10:04.213
Not my dirt. I just... heard.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.621
I've heard, too.

10:05.655 --> 10:08.290
Word is, he does what it
takes to get the job done.

10:08.324 --> 10:10.357
He's teflon. Nothing ever sticks.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.759
That's because he's careful.

10:11.794 --> 10:14.094
Every memory drive in his
van was wiped clean.

10:14.129 --> 10:15.780
There's nothing to tie him back to Alice.

10:15.831 --> 10:18.533
I don't care how careful he is,
someone hired him to kill her.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.235
This time he's not walking away.

10:20.669 --> 10:21.692
I'm sorry, detective,

10:21.771 --> 10:23.691
but I've never seen
this woman before in my life.

10:24.039 --> 10:25.839
Even though my colleagues witnessed you.

10:25.873 --> 10:27.907
In the back of your van,
shredding her photo?

10:27.942 --> 10:31.311
Your colleagues were mistaken.

10:31.346 --> 10:32.812
But that was a micro-cut shredder,

10:32.847 --> 10:34.681
so unfortunately
there's no proof either way.

10:34.716 --> 10:37.016
We can place you in her office building.

10:37.051 --> 10:39.453
On 77th Street at the time of her murder.

10:39.487 --> 10:41.554
So if you didn't know Alice Clark,

10:41.588 --> 10:43.689
what the hell were you doing there?

10:43.724 --> 10:47.627
My favorite shoeshine
guy's in that building.

10:49.195 --> 10:50.963
Right. On the ninth floor?

10:50.997 --> 10:54.066
Right down the hall
from her ransacked office?

10:57.169 --> 10:59.304
Can't really make out his face.

10:59.338 --> 11:01.373
Hard to say who that guy is.

11:01.407 --> 11:02.940
Come on, detective.

11:02.975 --> 11:05.877
What do you really have on me?

11:05.911 --> 11:08.680
There isn't a single piece
of evidence I was in her office,

11:08.714 --> 11:11.283
or that I was involved in her death.

11:11.317 --> 11:13.950
Prints?

11:13.985 --> 11:16.620
DNA?

11:16.655 --> 11:18.522
Anything?

11:20.558 --> 11:22.058
That's what I thought.

11:22.093 --> 11:24.828
Just like she said... teflon.

11:24.862 --> 11:28.131
The only way to nail this man
is to figure out who hired him,

11:28.166 --> 11:29.465
and for that,

11:29.500 --> 11:32.201
we need to know what
Barrett Hawke was sent to find.

11:32.235 --> 11:34.671
I've been through just about everything...

11:34.705 --> 11:37.006
Her research notes, her book files,

11:37.040 --> 11:38.040
everything's intact.

11:38.074 --> 11:39.514
I've rechecked it a couple of times.

11:39.543 --> 11:40.677
Against our index files,

11:40.711 --> 11:42.812
and there's only one thing missing.

11:42.846 --> 11:43.846
What's that?

11:43.880 --> 11:45.547
A client file.

11:45.581 --> 11:46.715
Which client?

11:46.749 --> 11:49.217
Andrew and Monica Spencer.

11:49.251 --> 11:52.220
Andrew Spencer... the hotel
and real estate tycoon?

11:52.254 --> 11:53.422
Who would want his file?

11:53.456 --> 11:58.159
Actually, I think Andrew Spencer wanted it.

11:58.194 --> 12:00.561
Why would he want his own file?

12:00.595 --> 12:01.862
Because...

12:01.896 --> 12:03.698
Well, it's not public knowledge yet,

12:03.732 --> 12:05.633
but the Spencers are getting a divorce,

12:05.667 --> 12:07.535
and last week, Mrs. Spencer's attorney.

12:07.569 --> 12:09.570
Subpoenaed Alice to turn
all of her session notes.

12:09.604 --> 12:10.838
Over to the court.

12:10.872 --> 12:12.573
Andrew Spencer's worth billions.

12:12.607 --> 12:15.676
If there was any compromising
information in those notes,

12:15.711 --> 12:18.177
it would cost him boatloads
in a settlement.

12:18.212 --> 12:19.779
Wait. Doesn't, state law protect.

12:19.814 --> 12:21.681
Therapist/client privacy?

12:21.716 --> 12:24.451
Except Alice wasn't a licensed therapist.

12:24.485 --> 12:26.720
She was more of a relationship coach.

12:26.754 --> 12:28.254
When Mr. Spencer found out.

12:28.288 --> 12:29.756
The sessions weren't privileged...

12:29.790 --> 12:31.758
He hit the roof.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.359
He threatened to sue.

12:33.393 --> 12:35.227
Well, looks like he did more than just sue.

12:35.261 --> 12:36.628
You know where we can find him?

12:36.663 --> 12:39.197
Mr. Spencer will be right with you.

12:39.232 --> 12:40.399
Okay.

12:40.433 --> 12:43.268
I gotta hand it to this Alice chick, bro.

12:43.302 --> 12:44.436
Whatever her monkey theory is.

12:44.471 --> 12:46.572
Has her in with the movers and the shakers.

12:46.606 --> 12:48.973
She learned from the real gorillas.

12:49.007 --> 12:51.275
Seems to be working
with the 800-pound ones.

12:51.309 --> 12:52.844
In the human world.

12:52.878 --> 12:56.313
She was like the dog whisperer for CEOs

12:56.348 --> 12:59.083
You really buy that?

12:59.117 --> 13:00.685
Yeah. Skimmed through her book.

13:00.719 --> 13:02.620
I think there might be
something to her theory.

13:02.654 --> 13:04.988
For instance, she said that
in every relationship,

13:05.022 --> 13:06.823
there needs to be a masculine energy.

13:06.858 --> 13:08.625
And a feminine energy, even in ours.

13:08.659 --> 13:11.327
Well, we know which one you are.

13:11.362 --> 13:12.596
I don't know about you,

13:12.630 --> 13:14.964
but I'm very comfortable in my masculinity.

13:14.999 --> 13:17.100
You do realize you're wearing a
sweater vest, right?

13:17.134 --> 13:18.668
Better be important.

13:18.703 --> 13:22.471
I just hung up on my
investment group in Singapore.

13:22.506 --> 13:24.607
Andrew Spencer, detective Esposito...

13:24.609 --> 13:28.043
I don't give a rat's ass who you
are. What do you want?

13:28.077 --> 13:31.414
Alice Clark. You know her?

13:31.448 --> 13:33.048
Yeah, I know her. Why?

13:33.082 --> 13:34.550
Well, she had a client file.

13:34.584 --> 13:36.984
Of you and your soon-to-be
ex-wife Monica...

13:37.019 --> 13:38.219
A file that's currently missing.

13:38.253 --> 13:39.320
I get it.

13:39.354 --> 13:40.994
Did my wife's attorney put you up to this?

13:41.023 --> 13:42.390
You know what this is?

13:42.425 --> 13:44.091
- This is harassment.
- No, Mr. Spencer.

13:44.126 --> 13:45.593
This is a murder investigation.

13:45.628 --> 13:48.630
A murder investigation? But who's dead?

13:48.664 --> 13:49.864
Alice.

13:51.534 --> 13:52.900
Alice is dead?

13:52.934 --> 13:54.301
Come on, Spencer.

13:54.335 --> 13:56.904
Drop the act. We know
you hired Barrett Hawke...

13:56.938 --> 13:58.906
To kill her and take the files.

13:58.940 --> 14:00.501
We've already linked him to her murder.

14:00.508 --> 14:03.911
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That had nothing to do with me.

14:03.945 --> 14:06.447
Look, I've heard of Hawke,

14:06.481 --> 14:07.802
but I've never used his services.

14:07.816 --> 14:09.415
Hell, I wouldn't even know
how to find the guy, and, yes,

14:09.450 --> 14:12.117
I wanted my file, but Alice gave it to me.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.853
She brought it to me herself.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.087
I- I have witnesses.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.189
Why would Alice give it to you?

14:17.223 --> 14:18.324
I reminded my wife that those sessions.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.692
Contained plenty of statements.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.661
That she wouldn't want
on the public record either.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.930
She agreed, and we both called Alice.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.296
Alice understood our need for privacy,

14:25.331 --> 14:27.799
so she offered to turn it over
in exchange for a favor.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.634
Yeah? What kind of favor?

14:29.669 --> 14:31.436
It's actually strange.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.104
She said she needed a room
in one of my hotels.

14:33.138 --> 14:34.339
For a couple days,

14:34.373 --> 14:37.041
and I had to promise
that there'd be no record.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.977
That she was ever there.

14:41.179 --> 14:43.547
Alice dropped 50 grand to charter a plane,

14:43.582 --> 14:46.416
yet she needed Spencer to
comp a hotel room for her?

14:46.451 --> 14:49.386
That's because it wasn't about the money.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.154
It was about the anonymity.

14:51.189 --> 14:53.023
She even told the front desk
that she didn't want.

14:53.057 --> 14:54.492
Housekeeping in her room,

14:54.526 --> 14:57.326
and she didn't tell her
boyfriend where she was.

14:57.361 --> 14:58.862
Not that she would need housekeeping.

14:58.896 --> 15:00.630
There's no luggage here,
nothing in the bathroom.

15:00.664 --> 15:02.499
It's like she was never even here.

15:05.536 --> 15:10.673
Yeah, but she checked in yesterday morning.

15:10.708 --> 15:11.808
Castle?

15:11.842 --> 15:14.242
What if this was a safe house?

15:14.276 --> 15:18.146
What if she knew that Hawke
was coming after her?

15:18.180 --> 15:20.348
And she decided to hide out here.

15:20.383 --> 15:23.151
Until she could flee the country.

15:23.185 --> 15:26.922
With a plane standing by?
What was she waiting for?

15:26.956 --> 15:29.089
No, no, no, no. Something is going on here.

15:29.124 --> 15:30.825
The reason why she got this room...

15:30.859 --> 15:33.020
She didn't want anybody to
know about it.

15:36.097 --> 15:37.899
The safe is locked.

15:37.933 --> 15:40.902
She got it to hide something.
Come take a look.

15:40.936 --> 15:44.638
I bet whatever Hawke
was after, it's in there...

15:44.672 --> 15:46.239
A place she knew it'd be safe,

15:46.273 --> 15:48.241
and knew no one would think to look for it.

15:48.275 --> 15:50.577
Which means it's still in there.

15:50.611 --> 15:51.845
Is there an override code?

15:53.047 --> 15:56.482
Whatever's in there is
the reason why she was killed.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.754
Thank you.

16:19.772 --> 16:23.240
Castle, this must be worth millions.

16:23.275 --> 16:26.577
Tens of millions.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.347
Looks like diamonds were
our girl's best friend.

16:35.041 --> 16:37.976
I've never seen anything
like this outside of a museum.

16:38.510 --> 16:40.011
Are you sure it's real?

16:40.045 --> 16:41.780
We stopped at a jewelers.

16:41.814 --> 16:44.149
On the way back, and he almost
had a heart attack.

16:44.183 --> 16:47.351
It has to be what Hawke was after, but...

16:47.386 --> 16:49.553
What was Alice doing with it?

16:49.588 --> 16:51.890
Given the cash, the hotel room,
and the private plane,

16:51.924 --> 16:53.423
I'd say she was making a getaway.

16:53.457 --> 16:54.825
Are you saying she stole it?

16:54.859 --> 16:57.027
A trusted therapist
to "A" -list clientele...

16:57.061 --> 17:00.597
She was in the perfect position
to work her way inside.

17:00.631 --> 17:03.333
She's "Ocean's eleven," minus ten.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.102
She's... "Ocean's one."

17:05.136 --> 17:07.037
Or maybe it's "Ocean's none."

17:07.070 --> 17:09.771
I mean, Alice was successful.

17:09.807 --> 17:11.707
Well, she's respected.
She's at the top of her game.

17:11.741 --> 17:13.709
Why would she risk it all
by stealing a diamond?

17:13.742 --> 17:15.811
Which brings up another problem.

17:15.846 --> 17:19.048
I spoke to the boys in robbery
and at the FBI.

17:19.082 --> 17:21.750
No one has reported a diamond
like this stolen,

17:21.785 --> 17:23.920
not just recently. Ever.

17:23.954 --> 17:26.188
- Then where did it come from?
- And if it was stolen,

17:26.222 --> 17:28.356
why haven't the owners reported it?

17:28.390 --> 17:32.093
What if it's because
they couldn't afford to?

17:32.128 --> 17:34.629
Because the diamond has
some kind of sordid past.

17:34.663 --> 17:36.364
Perhaps it's like the hope
diamond. It's cursed.

17:36.398 --> 17:39.434
Or maybe it's a... An occult
gem of great power,

17:39.468 --> 17:42.402
- smuggled out of Nazi Germany, shoved up some...
- Thank you, Mr. Castle.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.770
Someone knows where it came from.

17:43.805 --> 17:46.740
Someone sent Barrett Hawke
after Alice to get it.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.543
Maybe the diamond could tell us.

17:49.577 --> 17:51.812
What do you mean?

17:51.847 --> 17:53.214
Well, you said it yourself.

17:53.248 --> 17:55.216
You've never seen anything
like this outside of a museum.

17:55.250 --> 17:58.784
Diamonds this big are famous.
They have names...

17:58.819 --> 18:01.387
The Akbar Shah, the Angola Star,

18:01.421 --> 18:03.289
the, um... Excelsior.

18:03.324 --> 18:06.826
Now this diamond has a story.

18:06.861 --> 18:08.928
If we can figure out what that story is,

18:08.963 --> 18:11.164
it might just give us a path to our killer.

18:11.198 --> 18:12.398
Yeah, Castle's right.

18:12.432 --> 18:15.267
This city is the hub of the
nation's diamond trade.

18:15.301 --> 18:17.035
There has to be an expert out there.

18:17.070 --> 18:18.803
That can tell us where it came from.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.408
Such beauty.

18:23.442 --> 18:25.244
It's absolutely stunning.

18:25.278 --> 18:26.578
Can you tell where it came from?

18:26.612 --> 18:28.013
Diamonds are not people, detective.

18:28.047 --> 18:29.613
A diamond mined in Asia looks the same.

18:29.647 --> 18:30.915
As a diamond mined in Africa.

18:30.949 --> 18:32.917
However, there are no mines in America,

18:32.951 --> 18:34.352
so, it is not from here.

18:34.386 --> 18:35.987
What my partner means is.

18:36.021 --> 18:38.356
Have you come across this stone before?

18:38.390 --> 18:40.657
Never.

18:40.692 --> 18:43.160
And as head of the American
Gemological Foundation,

18:43.195 --> 18:45.362
I know every
extraordinary stone on the planet.

18:45.396 --> 18:47.830
- So you don't know who owns it?
- No, and I should.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.132
I mean, a discovery.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.800
Of an incredible gem
like this is headline-making.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.102
They become famous.

18:52.136 --> 18:54.504
- Could it be a recent import?
- No.

18:54.538 --> 18:56.806
I'm copied on gem reports
that pass through customs,

18:56.840 --> 18:58.909
and nothing remotely
this size has come through.

18:58.943 --> 19:01.977
In my entire tenure at the AGF.

19:02.012 --> 19:04.780
No, the origins of this stone
are a complete mystery.

19:04.814 --> 19:06.982
Can you tell me how you came to possess it?

19:07.017 --> 19:09.318
It's evidence in an ongoing
investigation, so...

19:09.352 --> 19:12.154
<i>What can you tell us about this diamond?</i>

19:12.188 --> 19:15.224
Well, I should like to run
additional spectrometer.

19:15.258 --> 19:18.059
And imaging tests on it, but,

19:18.093 --> 19:20.194
for the meantime, let
me start with the four c's.

19:20.229 --> 19:21.562
Color, cut, clarity, carat.

19:21.596 --> 19:25.466
You'd know this if you ever
bought an engagement ring.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.968
The diamond is colorless.

19:27.002 --> 19:29.070
No blemishes, so a pristine cut,

19:29.104 --> 19:32.540
no internal clouding, and...

19:32.574 --> 19:35.175
Nearly 100 carats.

19:35.209 --> 19:36.276
Man.

19:36.311 --> 19:38.378
Hey, how deep would my pockets have to be.

19:38.413 --> 19:39.913
To afford a rock like that?

19:39.948 --> 19:41.014
Detective, you are not tall enough.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.183
To have pockets deep enough.

19:43.217 --> 19:45.852
But... I would say it's worth...

19:45.886 --> 19:48.255
$60 million.

19:48.289 --> 19:49.488
Conservatively.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.490
Yeah, I ain't that tall.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.196
Six-zero? Like with another
six zeroes after that?

19:57.230 --> 19:59.031
That would be $60 million, yes.

19:59.066 --> 20:00.666
Is it possible?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.368
It's an heirloom passed
down through generations,

20:02.402 --> 20:04.403
and that's why there's no record of it?

20:04.438 --> 20:06.604
Nah, Peters said that old-school cutters.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.606
Fashioned diamonds with sharp edges.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.409
This one has smooth edges,
which means it had to be cut.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.877
Within the last few decades.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.712
No customs declaration means.

20:14.746 --> 20:17.048
It was smuggled in probably from
the country where it was mined.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.884
Were we able to connect
any of Alice's clients.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.085
To the diamond?

20:21.119 --> 20:23.187
We're still going
through them, but no, not yet.

20:23.221 --> 20:24.521
Peters said he also found.

20:24.555 --> 20:25.856
Some glue residue on the stone,

20:25.890 --> 20:27.891
which suggests that it
was set in a piece of jewelry.

20:27.925 --> 20:29.093
For engaged men everywhere,

20:29.127 --> 20:30.760
I can only hope it wasn't the ring.

20:30.795 --> 20:32.863
Get that rock back to the precinct.

20:32.897 --> 20:35.599
I want it under lock, key, and armed guard.

20:35.633 --> 20:36.967
We're on our way.

20:38.435 --> 20:39.768
So...

20:39.803 --> 20:42.238
Are we thinking the same thing?

20:42.272 --> 20:44.040
That it's a bummer we can't stop for lunch.

20:44.074 --> 20:46.376
Because there's a $60 million
diamond sitting between us?

20:46.410 --> 20:49.012
No, that because of
the $60 million diamond.

20:49.046 --> 20:50.246
Sitting between us,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.681
that we are not-really-
but-kinda-sorta.

20:52.716 --> 20:55.317
Thinking about making a run for the border.

20:55.351 --> 20:58.487
That didn't even cross my mind.

20:58.521 --> 21:00.455
Of course it didn't.

21:00.490 --> 21:03.492
Nope. You wouldn't have the stones.

21:03.526 --> 21:05.760
All I'm saying.

21:08.964 --> 21:11.298
- You breathing?
- Yeah, for now.

21:11.333 --> 21:12.833
Gun!

21:12.867 --> 21:13.901
Get down!

21:26.789 --> 21:28.623
Three of them! The diamond.

21:28.657 --> 21:30.792
Subway entrance, 7:00. I'll cover you. Go!

21:35.663 --> 21:37.265
Go!

21:47.509 --> 21:49.576
- You all right?
- Yeah.

21:49.610 --> 21:51.044
I'm good. I'm...

21:51.079 --> 21:54.447
The SUV took off right after
you hit the subway.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.983
We're pulling traffic
footage, and we've got.

21:57.018 --> 21:58.418
Every cop in the city looking for it.

21:58.452 --> 22:00.053
And you said they were wearing masks?

22:00.088 --> 22:01.387
Yeah, clown masks.

22:01.422 --> 22:03.123
As if clowns weren't creepy enough.

22:03.157 --> 22:04.657
What about their
voices? Did they say anything?

22:04.692 --> 22:06.491
Did they have accents?

22:06.526 --> 22:08.560
They let their bullets do the talking.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.515
Captain, they attacked us in broad
daylight, they knew we had the rock.

22:12.099 --> 22:15.334
Now either Barrett Hawke has
gone commando all of a sudden,

22:15.368 --> 22:18.945
- or something else is going on here.
- He's right, I mean this is starting to sound like.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.976
It's about a whole lot more
than just a diamond.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.407
Okay. Get cleaned up.

22:23.442 --> 22:26.009
I need you two to go hunting for that SUV.

22:26.044 --> 22:29.146
Whatever's going on, Alice was
in it up to her eyeballs.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.915
If any of her clients have
even the remotest connection.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.851
To a country that produces diamonds,

22:33.885 --> 22:34.985
I wanna know about it.

22:35.019 --> 22:37.120
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

22:40.224 --> 22:42.191
So I was thinking...

22:42.226 --> 22:44.761
When we work a case together,

22:44.795 --> 22:48.097
this desk of yours is sort of.

22:48.131 --> 22:51.000
<i>Kind of our space, and...</i>

22:51.034 --> 22:54.156
These elephants on parade
have creeped me out.

22:54.237 --> 22:56.539
Since day one, so what do you say.

22:56.574 --> 22:58.708
We just get rid of these?

22:58.742 --> 23:01.544
I'm sorry. Do you have a problem with that?

23:01.579 --> 23:03.379
If I try to get rid of something.

23:03.413 --> 23:06.583
That obviously has deep meaning to you?

23:06.617 --> 23:10.518
If you don't like the elephants,
I don't like the elephants.

23:14.924 --> 23:16.186
Fine.

23:18.127 --> 23:19.695
I actually like those elephants.

23:19.729 --> 23:22.064
They've obviously have family values,

23:22.098 --> 23:24.066
and this one's good with money.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.133
Anyway...

23:25.167 --> 23:27.702
Any luck on Alice's clients?

23:27.736 --> 23:29.704
Yeah, a couple of possibilities...

23:29.738 --> 23:30.838
A hedge fund manager.

23:30.872 --> 23:32.773
With investments in South Africa,

23:32.808 --> 23:35.142
a UN diplomat with ties to Russia,

23:35.176 --> 23:37.544
and a CEOs with a manufacturing plant

23:37.579 --> 23:39.238
80 miles from a Chinese mine.

23:41.116 --> 23:43.116
What if we're looking at this wrong?

23:43.150 --> 23:44.667
What if it's not about Alice's clients,

23:44.699 --> 23:46.886
but it's actually about Alice?

23:46.921 --> 23:48.989
- What do you mean?
- When she was living.

23:49.023 --> 23:51.091
With the gorillas in Africa,
that was in Rwanda,

23:51.125 --> 23:52.759
right along the border of the Congo...

23:52.793 --> 23:54.460
A region known for conflict diamonds.

23:54.495 --> 23:56.896
So you think she was involved
in the blood diamond trade?

23:56.931 --> 23:58.998
I think it's a story that writes itself.

23:59.032 --> 24:01.266
A young primatologist.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.836
In an unstable region falls for.

24:03.870 --> 24:06.438
A different kind of guerilla... a warlord.

24:06.472 --> 24:10.709
Who is funding his
bloody agenda with diamonds.

24:10.744 --> 24:12.678
He gives her one as a gift.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.988
No. No, go back.

24:15.114 --> 24:17.682
She's not that into him,
and she steals the diamond,

24:17.716 --> 24:20.352
having no idea its real value.

24:20.386 --> 24:22.254
She smuggles it back to the
United States and finds.

24:22.288 --> 24:24.722
She can't sell it without
attracting too much attention,

24:24.757 --> 24:27.225
so she hides it until one day.

24:27.260 --> 24:30.894
A jilted and
well-read warlord finds a book.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.697
And sees her photo on the back.

24:33.731 --> 24:35.832
Knowing what she stole,

24:35.867 --> 24:39.236
he comes after her.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.541
That is... Surprisingly plausible.

24:43.575 --> 24:45.442
I know, right? It's actually...

24:45.476 --> 24:47.510
That would actually explain a lot...

24:47.545 --> 24:49.779
Why she was planning to disappear,

24:49.813 --> 24:51.581
why Esposito and Ryan
were shot at in broad daylight.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.950
That's actually a perfect theory.

24:53.984 --> 24:55.351
Maybe, Castle, but you know what?

24:55.386 --> 24:56.546
I might have... a better one.

24:56.554 --> 24:58.221
What do you know about Steve Warner?

24:58.255 --> 25:00.923
- Tech entrepreneur?
- Yeah. Apparently,

25:00.958 --> 25:02.691
he and his wife were Alice's clients.

25:02.725 --> 25:04.493
And what, they had business contacts.

25:04.527 --> 25:06.728
- In
diamond-producing countries? - No.

25:06.762 --> 25:08.097
But their charitable foundation does...

25:08.131 --> 25:11.800
Primarily in Africa,
delivering immunizations.

25:11.834 --> 25:14.536
To developing and war-torn countries.

25:14.571 --> 25:16.805
Okay. But what makes
your heroic philanthropist story.

25:16.839 --> 25:18.439
Better than my crazed warlord story?

25:18.474 --> 25:20.441
This.

25:20.476 --> 25:24.712
That's Steve and Janet Warner
at the amnesty global benefit.

25:24.746 --> 25:26.414
Two nights ago. Janet's on their board.

25:29.851 --> 25:32.953
- You recognize anything?
- Hello, gorgeous.

25:33.588 --> 25:35.154
Mr. and Mrs. Warner,

25:35.189 --> 25:36.823
- thank you so much for coming.
- Of course.

25:36.857 --> 25:40.559
We can't tell you how shocked
we were to hear about Alice.

25:40.594 --> 25:42.661
How long had the two of
you been her clients?

25:42.696 --> 25:43.730
A couple of years.

25:43.764 --> 25:45.031
She saved our marriage.

25:45.065 --> 25:48.034
Being a power couple isn't
easy. Alice understood that.

25:48.068 --> 25:50.836
Just curious... when the two
of you would meet with Alice,

25:50.870 --> 25:53.772
would you go to her office,
or would she come to your home?

25:53.773 --> 25:54.964
Both. Why?

25:55.008 --> 25:56.775
Did she ever have access to your place?

25:56.809 --> 25:59.160
Did you ever give her
keys or security codes?

25:59.391 --> 26:01.525
No. Why would we? What's this all about?

26:02.402 --> 26:05.750
We believe her murder
is connected to a theft.

26:05.784 --> 26:07.685
A theft?

26:07.719 --> 26:10.321
Yeah, a rather significant one.

26:10.356 --> 26:13.525
Either of you notice anything missing?

26:13.559 --> 26:14.925
Like what?

26:24.301 --> 26:27.236
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

26:27.271 --> 26:29.672
Mr. Warner, that is your diamond,

26:29.706 --> 26:32.475
all 100 carats of it.

26:32.509 --> 26:34.761
It was found in Alice's possession.

26:34.879 --> 26:36.712
Any idea how she got it?

26:36.747 --> 26:39.214
I think there's been a mistake.
This isn't ours.

26:39.249 --> 26:42.384
It's not? I've never that
stone before in my life.

26:42.418 --> 26:43.418
Really? Well...

26:44.954 --> 26:46.554
You were wearing it the other night.

26:47.957 --> 26:50.725
I see the confusion.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.728
The stone in my necklace...
That's not a diamond.

26:53.763 --> 26:56.297
It's a costume piece. It's just crystal.

26:56.331 --> 26:59.133
Crystal. Mrs. Warner,
that is the same stone.

26:59.168 --> 27:02.937
Detective, you're mistaken.
They only look similar.

27:02.971 --> 27:05.273
Well, then I suppose you won't mind.

27:05.307 --> 27:06.808
If we send one of our detectives.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.976
Home with you to look
at it? Just to be sure.

27:10.011 --> 27:12.445
I think we're done here. If
you have any more questions,

27:12.479 --> 27:14.948
you can direct them to my attorneys.

27:17.018 --> 27:18.351
Of course they're lying,

27:18.385 --> 27:20.553
but the real question
is why are they lying?

27:20.587 --> 27:21.922
Well, given their net worth,

27:21.956 --> 27:23.623
better to take a $60-million loss.

27:23.657 --> 27:25.425
Than be connected with a dead body.

27:25.459 --> 27:26.926
No, Castle, it's more than that.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.861
If they knew that Alice stole that diamond,

27:28.895 --> 27:31.496
they should've gone to the
cops, but they didn't.

27:31.531 --> 27:33.098
Why?

27:33.133 --> 27:34.967
Probably because if
they did, that would mean.

27:35.001 --> 27:36.802
Having to reveal
where the diamond came from.

27:36.837 --> 27:38.437
There's gotta be a reason
why no one's heard of it,

27:38.471 --> 27:40.840
and it must be a nefarious one.

27:40.874 --> 27:43.775
Which means they would do anything.

27:43.810 --> 27:46.277
Outside of going to the
cops to get it back.

27:46.312 --> 27:47.512
You may be right.

27:47.547 --> 27:48.680
So uniforms just talked to the doorman.

27:48.715 --> 27:49.948
At the Warners' building in Tribeca.

27:49.982 --> 27:51.082
He says he buzzed Hawke.

27:51.116 --> 27:52.984
Up to their penthouse yesterday morning.

27:53.018 --> 27:55.019
And Alice was killed last night.

27:55.054 --> 27:57.155
Looks like New York's famous fixer.

27:57.189 --> 27:59.824
Is in a bit of a fix.

28:05.606 --> 28:08.680
So I visited some friends in
Tribeca. Doesn't prove anything.

28:08.941 --> 28:10.308
Why were you at the Warners'?

28:10.342 --> 28:11.709
I needed to use their bathroom.

28:11.743 --> 28:13.278
Are we really gonna dance this dance again?

28:13.312 --> 28:14.845
'Cause I got better things to do.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.725
Sit down!

28:17.036 --> 28:20.137
<i>Now, Mr. Hawke.</i>

28:28.293 --> 28:30.593
You're not walking away from this one.

28:30.628 --> 28:32.162
I've connected you to the Warners,

28:32.196 --> 28:35.164
the Warners to the stone,
the stone to the dead girl,

28:35.198 --> 28:37.099
and the dead girl back to you.

28:37.134 --> 28:38.667
And then there is also.

28:38.701 --> 28:42.004
The matter of the armed assault
on two NYPD detectives.

28:42.039 --> 28:44.340
I did not kill Alice Clark,

28:44.374 --> 28:47.376
and I had nothing to
do with any... assault.

28:47.411 --> 28:49.478
Then who did?

28:56.518 --> 28:58.920
Turn off the mic.

29:13.776 --> 29:16.437
My business is discretion.

29:16.471 --> 29:19.006
So none of this is on the
record. Do you follow?

29:21.776 --> 29:25.278
Yes, the Warners hired
me to find the diamond.

29:25.312 --> 29:26.879
That's it.

29:26.913 --> 29:29.115
<i>So then it was you?</i>

29:29.149 --> 29:31.484
In her office? In the car?

29:31.518 --> 29:32.986
Yeah.

29:33.020 --> 29:34.187
Looking for the stone,

29:34.221 --> 29:36.322
but Alice was already
dead when I got there.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.123
I do things, detective...

29:38.157 --> 29:40.825
Questionable things, but I don't kill.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.427
Okay.

29:44.097 --> 29:46.398
So then who attacked my colleagues?

29:46.432 --> 29:48.000
Wasn't me. Wasn't the Warners.

29:48.034 --> 29:50.402
Maybe somebody else was
looking for the diamond.

29:50.436 --> 29:52.971
And how did you know Alice stole it?

29:53.006 --> 29:55.039
Because when the Warners
described the mugging,

29:55.073 --> 29:56.640
I could tell it was an inside job.

29:56.674 --> 29:59.377
The Warners were mugged?

29:59.411 --> 30:01.879
Two nights ago, and it wasn't random.

30:01.913 --> 30:03.381
The mugger knew exactly.

30:03.415 --> 30:05.883
When and where they were gonna be.

30:05.917 --> 30:07.851
So did Alice. Not only that,

30:07.886 --> 30:09.220
but Janet told Alice.

30:09.254 --> 30:11.087
About the diamond in one of their sessions.

30:11.122 --> 30:13.589
Apparently, hardly anyone else
knew the diamond was real.

30:13.624 --> 30:15.492
I figured Alice had to be involved.

30:15.526 --> 30:17.427
Okay, so if the Warners were mugged,

30:17.461 --> 30:19.562
why wouldn't they just go to the police?

30:19.596 --> 30:21.264
They wanted to keep things quiet.

30:21.298 --> 30:23.366
Okay.

30:25.503 --> 30:26.835
I need you to tell me everything you know.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.703
About that mugging.

30:28.738 --> 30:30.939
Where were
they when it happened?

30:30.973 --> 30:34.043
While they were walking home
from the Amnesty Benefit.

30:34.077 --> 30:36.412
And how did Alice pull it off?

30:36.446 --> 30:37.679
She didn't.

30:37.713 --> 30:40.782
The Warners said the mugger
wore a ski mask.

30:40.816 --> 30:42.684
But was definitely male.

30:45.087 --> 30:47.689
Alice had an accomplice?

30:47.723 --> 30:49.190
If Hawke's telling the truth,

30:49.224 --> 30:51.059
then there's another player involved...

30:51.093 --> 30:53.294
Someone who knew that the diamond was real.

30:53.328 --> 30:54.763
And used Alice to get it.

30:54.797 --> 30:56.431
Do you think Alice was under duress?

30:56.465 --> 30:58.132
That someone was forcing her to help?

30:58.167 --> 30:59.299
Threatening to kill her?

30:59.333 --> 31:01.201
That would explain why she did it.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.403
And why she was trying to disappear.

31:03.438 --> 31:05.072
Hey, we got a hit on our clown car.

31:05.106 --> 31:07.641
Uniforms found it
abandoned by the east river.

31:07.676 --> 31:09.076
SUV's been bleached and torched.

31:09.110 --> 31:10.811
CSU's scouring it for clues,

31:10.845 --> 31:12.913
but seems like it was a high-level job.

31:12.948 --> 31:14.881
And Tory has something on the mugging.

31:14.915 --> 31:17.717
Okay, now according to Hawke,
the mugger snatched the necklace.

31:17.751 --> 31:21.821
At 11:00 on 52nd Street
and bolted south on 8th.

31:21.855 --> 31:24.390
Unfortunately, there are no
street or security cams.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.425
In the vicinity, but a 911 call.

31:26.460 --> 31:28.327
Came in two minutes later.

31:28.361 --> 31:30.996
From 49th and 8th... 3 blocks away.

31:31.030 --> 31:33.665
<i>(Man
911. What's your emergency?</i>

31:33.700 --> 31:35.000
<i>There's been a hit and run.</i>

31:35.034 --> 31:36.334
<i>What's your location?
I'll send an ambulance.</i>

31:36.368 --> 31:38.604
<i>No! You don't understand. I hit someone,</i>

31:38.638 --> 31:40.271
<i>- and he ran.
- He ran?</i>

31:40.306 --> 31:42.841
<i>Yeah, a man dressed all
in black, wearing a ski mask.</i>

31:42.875 --> 31:44.977
<i>He came out of nowhere.</i>

31:45.011 --> 31:46.111
That's gotta be our guy.

31:46.145 --> 31:48.012
Get over there. Get a full description.

31:48.046 --> 31:49.880
I can still hear the sound of his body.

31:49.915 --> 31:51.782
Going "Thunk" on my hood.

31:51.817 --> 31:53.317
Do you remember what he looked like?

31:53.351 --> 31:56.954
No. The whole thing was a blur.
Just that God-awful sound.

31:56.989 --> 31:58.889
He hit so hard, he left a dent.

31:58.924 --> 32:00.725
But when I got out of my car,

32:00.759 --> 32:03.159
he just pushed himself off and
ran down 49th.

32:03.193 --> 32:04.227
Here. I'll show you.

32:04.261 --> 32:06.830
His hands were up like this,

32:06.864 --> 32:07.964
and then... thank you.

32:07.999 --> 32:09.298
Thank you very much.

32:09.333 --> 32:10.654
All right. I'll call CSU

32:10.668 --> 32:11.635
Ryan here.

32:11.669 --> 32:12.936
Yes, detective.

32:12.970 --> 32:14.137
Edward Peters here.

32:14.171 --> 32:16.372
I believe I have new insights
into your diamond.

32:16.406 --> 32:18.775
After reviewing test results on the stone,

32:18.809 --> 32:21.010
my colleagues and I all reached
the same conclusion.

32:21.044 --> 32:22.811
Which is?

32:22.846 --> 32:23.979
The diamond is flawless...

32:24.014 --> 32:26.115
Flawless beyond anything
nature could create.

32:26.150 --> 32:27.283
You're saying it's fake?

32:27.317 --> 32:28.484
No, it's composed.

32:28.519 --> 32:31.220
Of carbon and entirely real,
but it is man-made.

32:31.255 --> 32:34.023
What are you saying, man-made?

32:34.057 --> 32:37.058
There have long been
industrially produced diamonds,

32:37.092 --> 32:38.193
carbon under heat.

32:38.227 --> 32:40.328
And pressure, mimicking
mother nature in a lab.

32:40.363 --> 32:42.063
But typically the stones are small.

32:42.097 --> 32:43.731
Or of inferior quality.

32:43.766 --> 32:46.535
So... it's not worth $60 million.

32:46.569 --> 32:48.303
No.

32:48.337 --> 32:51.039
It's actually worth infinitely more.

32:51.073 --> 32:53.875
In fact, it's priceless.

32:53.909 --> 32:55.910
Priceless?

32:55.944 --> 32:57.578
Priceless?

32:57.612 --> 32:58.713
Yeah, apparently,

32:58.747 --> 32:59.981
a stone of that size and quality...

33:00.015 --> 33:02.684
It's the holy grail
of diamond manufacturing,

33:02.718 --> 33:04.518
considered by most to be impossible.

33:04.553 --> 33:06.387
Until now.

33:06.421 --> 33:08.388
So... where did the Warners get it?

33:08.422 --> 33:10.157
And why are they denying its existence?

33:10.191 --> 33:11.591
I don't know.

33:11.625 --> 33:14.895
<i>I think I know who wanted it
and who attacked you boys.</i>

33:14.929 --> 33:16.663
A diamond like that made in a lab...

33:16.698 --> 33:18.364
That would put diamond companies
out of business.

33:18.399 --> 33:19.900
You think it's the diamond industry.

33:19.934 --> 33:21.401
Who sent in the clowns?

33:21.435 --> 33:22.803
With the future of their industry at stake?

33:22.837 --> 33:23.918
Who knows how far they'd go?

33:23.937 --> 33:26.038
Hey, guys. Tory got a hit.

33:26.073 --> 33:28.207
So CSU was able to pull a usable print?

33:28.241 --> 33:31.077
Yeah, lucky for us, the lady
wasn't big into washing her car.

33:31.111 --> 33:32.111
When we ran the print,

33:32.145 --> 33:33.512
nothing popped in the federal database.

33:33.546 --> 33:35.514
But given the international
nature of the diamond industry,

33:35.548 --> 33:38.584
I asked Tory to cast a wider net.

33:38.618 --> 33:39.984
We contacted Interpol.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.379
- Our mugger's a foreign national?
- South African, to be exact.

33:42.387 --> 33:43.855
His name is Leo Wyngaard...

33:43.889 --> 33:45.924
In and out of half a dozen African prisons.

33:45.958 --> 33:47.558
Not to mention, he's
on the terror watch list.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.293
Just the kind of guy a diamond cartel.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.362
Would hire for their dirty work.

33:51.396 --> 33:52.430
Now show 'em the picture.

33:54.299 --> 33:55.733
Look familiar?

33:55.767 --> 33:57.300
That's Matt Lanchet.

33:57.335 --> 33:58.702
Alice's boyfriend.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.207
We almost missed him at JFK.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.343
He was boarding a flight to Johannesburg.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.445
He must have cut his losses once he knew.

34:07.479 --> 34:08.846
We had secured the diamond.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.648
I still don't get why the Warners.

34:10.683 --> 34:12.782
Had a man-made stone in the first place.

34:12.817 --> 34:15.319
Well, whatever the reason,
Leo wanted that diamond,

34:15.353 --> 34:17.286
and he was using Alice to get it.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.723
Meaning he leveraged her into helping him,

34:19.757 --> 34:22.792
forced her to pull the
money out and order up the plane.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.661
Then he killed her,

34:24.696 --> 34:27.295
made this whole thing
look like it was her idea.

34:27.331 --> 34:30.132
Sir, considering that this guy.

34:30.166 --> 34:31.886
Tried to kill me and Espo for that diamond,

34:31.900 --> 34:34.103
you mind if we go in there
and get some answers?

34:37.907 --> 34:39.375
Wait.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.260
You think I'm working for The Cartels?

34:41.628 --> 34:43.862
That I was using Alice?

34:43.994 --> 34:45.513
I loved Alice.

34:45.514 --> 34:47.514
You always use fake names
with women that you love?

34:48.083 --> 34:50.417
She knew who I really was.
We were in this together.

34:50.452 --> 34:53.614
Yeah, sure, you were. Why would
you steal that diamond?

34:53.864 --> 34:56.958
Alice and I met in Rwanda
when I was doing aid work.

34:56.992 --> 34:58.792
We were young and in love.

34:58.827 --> 35:01.928
Then one day, soldiers came to the village,

35:01.963 --> 35:03.663
financed by the diamond cartel.

35:03.697 --> 35:06.466
We watched from the jungle
as they slaughtered everyone...

35:06.500 --> 35:09.469
Casualties of a turf war for profit.

35:10.050 --> 35:11.518
That day changed me.

35:12.422 --> 35:16.075
I dedicated myself to stopping
The Cartels' bloody practices.

35:16.109 --> 35:18.177
It was a life I knew Alice
couldn't be a part of,

35:18.211 --> 35:20.480
but I never stopped loving her.

35:20.514 --> 35:22.515
<i>So you're working against The Cartels.</i>

35:22.549 --> 35:25.418
By stealing a man-made diamond?

35:27.454 --> 35:30.590
Two years ago, stones started popping up.

35:30.624 --> 35:32.323
In Europe and the Middle East...

35:32.358 --> 35:34.593
Flawless, being sold for millions.

35:34.627 --> 35:36.928
That's when a gemologist friend of mine.

35:36.962 --> 35:38.997
Happened across a pair of them.

35:39.031 --> 35:42.567
He discovered that
they were exactly the same.

35:42.602 --> 35:45.270
Nature doesn't make exact copies.

35:45.304 --> 35:48.038
They were man-made.

35:48.072 --> 35:51.308
Yeah. I tried to trace them
back to their source.

35:51.342 --> 35:54.412
All I knew was that they were
coming out of the States,

35:54.446 --> 35:56.847
and then Alice called me out of the blue,

35:56.882 --> 35:59.950
said one of her clients,
Steve Warner, had a secret.

35:59.984 --> 36:02.286
Wait. Are you telling me that Steve Warner

36:02.320 --> 36:04.320
- can make diamonds?
- Yes.

36:04.354 --> 36:06.355
Man-made diamonds are nothing new,

36:06.390 --> 36:09.358
but no one had ever produced
this quality of gem before...

36:09.393 --> 36:10.727
Big and flawless.

36:10.761 --> 36:14.297
Soon, diamond mines
would be a relic of the past.

36:14.331 --> 36:17.133
Steve Warner's technology
could change everything.

36:17.167 --> 36:19.501
So I approached Warner.

36:19.536 --> 36:21.369
I begged him to make
his technology available,

36:21.404 --> 36:22.638
but he denied he even had it.

36:22.672 --> 36:24.973
He was just using it
to line his own pockets.

36:25.007 --> 36:27.375
The world needed to know,
and we needed proof.

36:27.410 --> 36:29.578
- The necklace.
- We knew that if we.

36:29.612 --> 36:30.913
Could just examine that stone,

36:30.947 --> 36:32.548
that we could tie it back to the others,

36:32.582 --> 36:34.550
then we could show everyone
what he was doing,

36:34.584 --> 36:36.918
and they could all see
that it was possible.

36:36.952 --> 36:40.054
Then... everyone would
eventually unlock the code.

36:40.088 --> 36:41.722
Then all of a sudden,
flawless, man-made diamonds.

36:41.757 --> 36:43.257
Would flood the market.

36:43.291 --> 36:46.828
No more Cartels. No more
sponsored bloodshed.

36:46.862 --> 36:49.609
We were gonna change the world.

36:50.406 --> 36:52.532
That night, Alice had a plane standing by.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.901
To take us to a private lab.

36:56.737 --> 36:58.104
But she never showed.

36:58.138 --> 37:00.607
Did anyone else know
you'd taken the diamond?

37:00.641 --> 37:03.543
The only people that knew
that diamond was gone.

37:03.578 --> 37:07.713
Were me, Alice, and the Warners.

37:09.048 --> 37:10.369
We told you, we're not answering.

37:10.383 --> 37:11.951
Questions about that diamond.

37:11.985 --> 37:13.519
Yeah, that's okay. There's
nothing that you can say.

37:13.553 --> 37:15.253
That we don't already know.

37:15.288 --> 37:18.090
For instance, we know it's man-made.

37:18.124 --> 37:21.727
And we know you are the man who made it.

37:21.761 --> 37:23.462
We also know that...

37:23.496 --> 37:27.064
You made a lot of cash secretly selling.

37:27.099 --> 37:29.233
Those man-made diamonds
on foreign markets.

37:29.267 --> 37:31.068
That's ridiculous. Do you
know what I'm worth?

37:31.069 --> 37:32.403
Why would I do that?

37:32.437 --> 37:34.973
You took a huge hit
during the economic downturn.

37:35.007 --> 37:36.941
You were leveraged to the hilt.

37:36.976 --> 37:38.610
You needed that cash.

37:38.644 --> 37:40.377
Even if what you're saying is true,

37:40.411 --> 37:42.312
that doesn't mean I murdered Alice!

37:42.346 --> 37:44.948
You did hire Hawke to
get that diamond back.

37:44.983 --> 37:49.620
Okay.

37:49.654 --> 37:52.122
I had to.

37:52.156 --> 37:54.558
I was afraid Vonroenn would find out.

37:54.592 --> 37:56.859
Vonroenn, the diamond cartel?

37:56.894 --> 37:57.927
What do they have to do with this?

37:57.961 --> 38:00.396
When I was in engineering school,

38:00.430 --> 38:03.566
I developed a process
for lab-grown diamonds.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.903
But all I could manage
were small flawed stones.

38:06.937 --> 38:08.771
They were worthless.

38:08.805 --> 38:11.373
At the time I had no money,
so I sold the technology.

38:11.408 --> 38:14.910
To the only people interested... Vonroenn.

38:14.944 --> 38:17.278
They wanted to
stifle the competition.

38:17.312 --> 38:18.914
You know, protect their market share.

38:18.948 --> 38:21.082
Then a few years ago, Janet and I.

38:21.116 --> 38:22.316
Hit a rough patch.

38:22.351 --> 38:24.285
And I wanted to give her
something meaningful.

38:24.319 --> 38:26.955
It was too easy just to buy her a diamond.

38:26.989 --> 38:29.489
So you decided to make one of your own.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.625
I broke out my equipment.

38:31.660 --> 38:34.461
So I could make her a small diamond.

38:34.495 --> 38:35.563
But in the process,

38:35.597 --> 38:37.598
I had a game-changing breakthrough.

38:37.632 --> 38:38.799
My little romantic gesture.

38:38.833 --> 38:42.469
Became one of the biggest
diamonds in history.

38:42.503 --> 38:46.606
Suddenly, I could make flawless stones...

38:46.640 --> 38:48.875
As many as I wanted.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.678
With technology that now
belonged to Vonroenn.

38:51.712 --> 38:54.413
And when the downturn hit
and you needed cash...

38:54.448 --> 38:57.850
You realized you had the means
as long as no one knew.

38:57.885 --> 38:59.185
It violated our agreement.

38:59.219 --> 39:01.753
If Vonroenn found out, they'd ruin me.

39:01.788 --> 39:04.255
Which is why you hired a strike team.

39:04.290 --> 39:06.357
To recover that stone from our custody.

39:06.392 --> 39:09.394
What? I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:09.428 --> 39:10.989
Mr. Warner, we found the SUV they used.

39:10.997 --> 39:12.363
It had been torched.

39:12.398 --> 39:16.300
But CSU still was able
to pull the VIN number.

39:16.334 --> 39:18.502
Turns out it was stolen
from a garage in Queens.

39:18.536 --> 39:20.204
And the garage owner, Joseph Bianchi?

39:20.238 --> 39:21.973
He's the brother-in-law
of your head of security.

39:22.007 --> 39:25.042
We also pulled phone records and found.

39:25.077 --> 39:27.044
That you and he had exchanged.

39:27.079 --> 39:28.779
At least half a dozen phone calls.

39:28.814 --> 39:30.514
In the hours before the attack.

39:30.548 --> 39:31.548
<i>What?</i>

39:31.583 --> 39:33.617
You ordered that strike.

39:33.651 --> 39:34.784
I- I didn't make these calls.

39:34.819 --> 39:36.185
I- I wasn't even home.

39:36.220 --> 39:37.520
It's... I...

39:41.258 --> 39:42.692
No.

39:42.727 --> 39:44.661
Janet?

39:44.695 --> 39:46.863
What did you do?

39:48.365 --> 39:49.932
What did I do?

39:49.966 --> 39:53.035
I treated her like family.

39:53.069 --> 39:54.537
I trusted her.

39:54.571 --> 39:57.106
When Hawke found out it
was Alice, I went to her,

39:57.141 --> 39:59.509
<i>begging for her to give the stone back.</i>

39:59.543 --> 40:01.611
I only meant to scare her,

40:01.645 --> 40:03.212
but she grabbed for the gun and...

40:03.247 --> 40:06.047
She would've exposed us, Steve.

40:06.081 --> 40:09.050
We were going to lose everything.

40:09.084 --> 40:13.188
I had to stop her. I had to get it back...

40:13.222 --> 40:15.790
For us.

40:15.824 --> 40:17.292
For you.

40:30.872 --> 40:32.039
Keep 'em closed.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.763
Castle, I swear
if you're bringing me

40:33.765 --> 40:35.064
Face-to-face with Linus,

40:35.066 --> 40:37.133
I'm gonna pull my gun out
and shoot him.

40:37.178 --> 40:39.345
- That will not be necessary.
- Okay.

40:39.380 --> 40:41.481
Okay, open.

40:42.650 --> 40:45.084
Seashells?

40:45.118 --> 40:48.388
<i>Well, not just seashells.
Those are our seashells.</i>

40:48.422 --> 40:49.556
We collected those...

40:49.590 --> 40:53.024
On our first walk in the Hamptons.

40:53.059 --> 40:55.994
Castle, you kept these?

40:56.028 --> 40:57.596
Now I know it doesn't
really go with the space.

40:57.630 --> 40:58.763
But at least it won't be hungrily staring.

40:58.765 --> 41:00.885
- At you in the morning.
- You didn't have to do this.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.069
No, I did, I did. I
finished reading Alice's book.

41:04.103 --> 41:07.506
And there's a chapter in there
that speaks to couples like us.

41:07.540 --> 41:08.839
See, we're both alphas.

41:08.873 --> 41:10.874
And it says that we need to define

41:10.909 --> 41:12.710
our shared territory together.

41:12.744 --> 41:15.746
These art pieces all over...
These are all my stories.

41:15.780 --> 41:18.849
But the shells? That's ours.

41:18.883 --> 41:20.585
I like our story.

41:20.619 --> 41:22.353
Yeah, me, too.

41:24.722 --> 41:26.256
That can't be good.

41:26.290 --> 41:29.058
You have to admit that we brought
this upon ourselves.

41:31.729 --> 41:32.696
Seriously?

41:32.730 --> 41:34.731
Look, if you're scared, you can always.

41:34.765 --> 41:36.205
Sleep on my side of the bed tonight.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.836
Deal.
