00:06.049 --> 00:07.659
Parenting is exhausting.

00:07.703 --> 00:10.010
- You're tired because you were
up until 5:00 in the morning

00:10.053 --> 00:11.272
playing a game on your phone.

00:11.315 --> 00:12.447
- It's not a game.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.014
It's a realistic
pizza parlor simulator.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.319
It's very different.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.147
There's no winning.
- Then why do you play?

00:17.191 --> 00:18.627
- To earn pizza points
to get better toppings.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.020
- What's up, Peralta?

00:20.063 --> 00:21.673
- Hey, Trudy Judy and dog Judy.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.414
what's going on?
Are you puppy sitting for Doug?

00:23.458 --> 00:25.155
- Well, I was, but I need you
to take him for me,

00:25.199 --> 00:27.157
because I'm going on
a little vacay,

00:27.201 --> 00:28.332
and let's just say

00:28.376 --> 00:30.030
there's going to be
some activities

00:30.073 --> 00:31.857
that aren't suitable
for a little dog.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.337
Mm!

00:33.381 --> 00:34.860
Like parasailing.
- Oh.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.645
Thought you were building
to something much more sexual.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.603
- Nope, just really pumped
for parasailing.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.170
Also, there's gonna be
a lot of [bleep],

00:40.214 --> 00:41.867
but the dog's okay with that.

00:41.911 --> 00:42.868
Here.
- Ugh.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.218
As much as we would love

00:44.261 --> 00:46.350
to take care of this
extremely unneutered animal,

00:46.394 --> 00:47.960
we can't,
because I'm too allergic.

00:48.004 --> 00:50.137
- Wait, why isn't Doug Judy
taking care of dog Judy?

00:50.180 --> 00:51.268
Is he out of town or something?

00:51.312 --> 00:52.835
- Oh, no, you didn't hear?

00:52.878 --> 00:54.706
Doug got arrested.
He's going to prison.

00:54.750 --> 00:55.968
- Wait, what?

00:56.012 --> 00:57.318
- Doug got arrested.
He's going to prison.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.754
- Yeah, no, I heard you.
I was just processing.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.887
- Aw. You want to hug a dog?
- Oh, my God.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.585
It's, like, a third of him.

01:06.631 --> 01:13.551

01:23.779 --> 01:25.650
- Sup, Peralta?
- Hey, what's going on?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.043
Why didn't you tell me
you're in jail?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.740
Did you not want me to find out
who arrested you?

01:28.784 --> 01:30.394
Is there another cop
in your life?

01:30.438 --> 01:31.874
- No, none of these pigs
mean jack to me.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.441
No offense to Evan.
You've been great this week.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.399
- I don't understand.
I thought you went straight.

01:35.443 --> 01:38.098
- I did. I got a job.
I have a wife.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.490
But the other day,
I was driving

01:39.534 --> 01:41.318
to the new mega Target
in South Orange, New Jersey

01:41.362 --> 01:42.972
because they have 50% off

01:43.015 --> 01:44.539
whole-home mesh
wireless systems.

01:44.582 --> 01:45.670
- With a rebate?
- No.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.150
Discount taken
at register.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.935
- Oh, you gotta hit that.
- I know.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.241
And on the way over there,

01:51.285 --> 01:52.764
a guy rear-ended me
and the cops showed up.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.418
Turns out I had a warrant out
for my arrest.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.593
- But we wiped
your criminal record.

01:55.637 --> 01:56.812
- You wiped my New York record.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.422
I stole a car in Trenton
five years ago.

01:58.466 --> 01:59.945
- Well, you still
should have called me.

01:59.989 --> 02:01.338
I could've helped you out.
- It wouldn't have mattered.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.687
There's a lot of evidence
against me.

02:02.731 --> 02:03.906
I left a picture of me
at the scene of the crime

02:03.949 --> 02:05.342
with a note bragging about
how I did it.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.866
- Ah, well, yes,
that would make it difficult.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.259
- Impossible.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.391
They're moving me
to South Woods prison tomorrow.

02:10.434 --> 02:11.522
- Tomorrow?
- I know.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.133
But you know
what really bums me out?

02:13.176 --> 02:14.612
I had no warning.

02:14.656 --> 02:15.874
I only wish that I had known
it was gonna happen

02:15.918 --> 02:17.920
so I could've had
one last moment of joy

02:17.963 --> 02:19.008
before I get taken to jail.

02:19.051 --> 02:21.141
But alas...'tis not to be.

02:21.184 --> 02:24.187
- Wait a minute.
What if it...'tis to be?

02:24.231 --> 02:26.276
What if I drive you to prison?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.625
We could have
one more adventure!

02:27.669 --> 02:28.670
- Honestly, Jake,
I don't see how it's possible

02:28.713 --> 02:30.628
to have fun on a trip
to prison.

02:30.672 --> 02:34.110
- Yeah, it sucks, but I dunno,
maybe for just a few hours,

02:34.154 --> 02:37.418
you could focus on the journey
and not the destination.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.464
- "Focus on the journey,
not the destination."

02:40.508 --> 02:42.640
I like that; did you steal it
from a car commercial?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.555
- No. It was an Instagram ad
for a travel bidet.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.949
Look, I know it's not perfect,
but if you say yes,

02:46.992 --> 02:49.778
I promise I will plan
some sexy-ass surprises.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.345
- How sexy we talking?

02:51.388 --> 02:52.998
- How sexy you got?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.784
- Is that a '79
Pontiac Trans Am?

02:55.827 --> 02:58.743
- Sexy-ass surprise number one.
We're riding in style.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.267
- I can't believe
the Department of Corrections

03:00.310 --> 03:01.920
was cool with you
taking your friend to prison.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.009
- Well, I can
be very persuasive.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.272
I got the guy and his family

03:05.315 --> 03:06.969
a six-day pass
to Pirate's Cove Waterpark.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.405
- So many days in the water.

03:08.449 --> 03:09.493
The family's gonna be pruney.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.755
- Yeah, it wasn't a good bribe.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.235
- Well, let's hit the road.
- Up-bup-bup.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.628
Before we do that.
There's another surprise,

03:13.671 --> 03:15.325
but I'm gonna need
your hands free for this one.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.805
- Wait, you got a pen?

03:16.848 --> 03:18.372
I'll show you a little trick
I learned from a magician

03:18.415 --> 03:20.374
who, for legal purposes,
shall remain nameless,

03:20.417 --> 03:24.073
but is unquestionably
a mind freak.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.248
-
Criss Angel.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.684
- I can neither confirm
nor deny--bam!

03:26.728 --> 03:28.512
Your cuffs and your pen, sir.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.210
- That was incredibly fast.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.037
Consider my mind freaked.

03:32.081 --> 03:35.302
On that note, it is time for
sexy-ass surprise number two.

cheeseburger cracker Combos?

06:08.629 --> 06:10.805
Weren't they discontinued?
Tell me the whole story.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.502
- A bodega in Queens
had an old box.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.504
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.114
Kind of makes me sad, though.
- How come?

06:16.158 --> 06:17.725
- One day,
it's out in the world thriving,

06:17.768 --> 06:20.423
and then poof,
gets pulled off the streets.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.120
- Ah.

06:22.164 --> 06:25.210
Well, I mean, it's not like
it's gone forever.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.951
You know, it'll be back
in circulation soon.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.953
- Maybe, but sometimes
when a product

06:28.997 --> 06:31.434
is taken off the shelves,
it never returns.

06:31.478 --> 06:32.783
- It's gonna be okay.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.785
I promise I'll visit
the Combos every month.

06:34.829 --> 06:37.614

very grateful for that.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.137
They're lucky to have

06:48.712 --> 06:50.671

06:50.714 --> 06:51.846

- Oh, that's not even
half my load.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.066

07:00.028 --> 07:01.638
This was an old crime, and
he's already owned up to it.

07:01.682 --> 07:02.900

07:02.944 --> 07:04.293
- He's already out

our sweet-ass outfit change.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.384

07:10.952 --> 07:12.388
you're putting your job
on the line,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.346

putting my job on the line.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.913
- How so?

07:15.957 --> 07:17.393
- Because if you get fired,
I will swim out into the ocean

07:17.437 --> 07:19.003
until I'm too tired
to swim back

07:19.047 --> 07:20.265
and I will sink to the bottom
and then I won't have a job.

07:20.309 --> 07:21.484
- Oh, my God.
All right.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.920
Well, I'm already
driving him to prison,

07:22.964 --> 07:24.531
so there's nothing
I can do about it now.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.141
- Oh, yes, there is.

07:26.576 --> 07:27.925
Welcome to the Boyle bus.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.449
- Why we getting
in this wack ride?

07:29.492 --> 07:31.842
- Charles refuses to accept
what close friends we are.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.365
He thinks you're trying
to escape

07:33.409 --> 07:35.193
and that your crew's on
the lookout for the Trans Am,

07:35.237 --> 07:37.457
so he insisted we switch
into his weird family bus.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.849
- That's ridiculous.
- Isn't it?

07:38.893 --> 07:40.242
- It doesn't matter
what vehicle we're in.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.504
- That's what I said.

07:41.548 --> 07:42.940
- I'm gonna escape from you
either way.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.159
- Exactly.
Wait, what was that?

07:47.075 --> 07:48.685
- I still don't understand.

07:48.729 --> 07:49.904
What do you mean
you're escaping?

07:49.947 --> 07:50.905
- Sorry, bro.
Plan is already in motion.

07:50.948 --> 07:51.775
Trudy came to you.
You took the bait.

07:51.819 --> 07:52.950
- Come on.

07:52.994 --> 07:53.864
If you were really trying
to escape,

07:53.908 --> 07:55.126
why would you tell me?

07:55.170 --> 07:56.040
- Honestly,
I didn't like lying to you.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.215
You're a good friend.

07:57.259 --> 07:58.347
- Well, if I'm such
a good friend,

07:58.390 --> 07:59.435
why are you trying
to escape from me?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.480
- I'm not trying
to escape from you.

08:00.523 --> 08:01.568
I'm trying to escape
from prison.

08:01.611 --> 08:02.612
Let me ask you this.

08:02.656 --> 08:03.874
Do you know why
I stole that car?

08:03.918 --> 08:05.354
- Because you
"love doing crimes."

08:05.397 --> 08:07.399
That's me directly
quoting your catchphrase.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.271
- First of all, my catchphrase
is "slurp, slurp."

08:09.314 --> 08:11.229
- You've never once said that.
- I say it constantly.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.188
Second of all,
me "loving crime"

08:13.231 --> 08:14.885
is classic empty bravado.

08:14.929 --> 08:16.147
The truth is I was arrested

08:16.191 --> 08:18.062
when I was 22
for something stupid.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.324
When I got out,
nobody would hire me

08:19.368 --> 08:21.326
because I had
a criminal record.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.025
My dreams of being a landscape
architect were out the window.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.417
- That was your dream?

08:25.461 --> 08:26.549
- I wanted to be the Black
Edward Scissorhands.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.985
- Oh, that's great.
- I get all that,

08:28.029 --> 08:29.421
but that's not
what this is about.

08:29.465 --> 08:30.597
I mean, you could have escaped
from anyone,

08:30.640 --> 08:32.120
but you chose to set me up.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.557
And now my job and my name
are all on the line.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.603
You used me, Doug.
You're a bad friend.

08:36.646 --> 08:37.908
- You're the bad friend.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.431
- I got you a tracksuit.
Tigers and toucs.

08:39.475 --> 08:40.737
- Might as well be a jumpsuit.

08:40.781 --> 08:41.956
A prison jumpsuit.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.479
You're taking me to prison.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.828
The fact that you thought
I'd go willingly

08:44.872 --> 08:46.134
means you don't know me at all.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.266
- Oh, please.
I know everything about you.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.790
- You didn't know
my catchphrase.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.531
- You have never once said
"slurp, slurp" before today.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.837
- That you believe that
is so hurtful.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.448
- Okay, well, there's clearly
only one way to settle this.

08:56.492 --> 08:58.102
- Ignore him and take him
directly to prison.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.451
- A high-stakes trivia contest

08:59.495 --> 09:00.844
to decide who's
the better friend.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.106
- What?
- If I win,

09:02.150 --> 09:03.586
you agree
not to try and escape.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.109
- But if I win,
you agree to let me go.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.894
- Deal.
- That is a bad idea.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.548
I cannot let you take
this risk, Jake.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.288
- It'll be just like game night
at the Camden Senior Center.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.551
You can be Estelle Minderman.

09:11.594 --> 09:14.249
- She's my favorite emcee.
Damn it, I'm in!

09:14.292 --> 09:16.207
- Charles!

09:16.251 --> 09:17.600
- The name of the game
is called,

09:17.644 --> 09:19.559
"Who Knows Mo', Friend Or Foe,
Are You Fo' Real

09:19.602 --> 09:21.256
Or Just Fo' Show?"
- Little wordy.

09:21.299 --> 09:24.128
- Each contestant will answer
and ask ten personal questions.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.956
Whoever gets the most
correct answers

09:26.000 --> 09:27.871
will be crowned
the better friend.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.178
- Also, there is that whole
"going to prison or not" thing.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.353
- America can't relate

09:31.396 --> 09:32.354
to the prison stuff;
it's too real.

09:32.397 --> 09:33.877
It's a game about friendship,

09:33.921 --> 09:35.618
and may the better friend win.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.099
Jake, you will ask
the first question.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.317
Begin!

09:39.361 --> 09:40.928
- What is my middle name?

09:40.971 --> 09:43.278
- You tell people it's Zack,
but it's really Jeffrey.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.541
- No, it's Zack,
like Zack Morris.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.934
- Point for Doug.

09:46.977 --> 09:47.848
- What is the name
of the alter ego

09:47.891 --> 09:49.632
I use for fancy crimes?

09:49.676 --> 09:51.634
- Lord Poncy Cumbershire.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.201
- 'Tis correct.
- Point for Jake.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.420
- What is my favorite
Knicks memory?

09:55.464 --> 09:56.944
- When they fired Phil Jackson.

09:56.987 --> 09:57.988
- Mm.

09:58.032 --> 10:00.251
Yeah, that was a good day.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.644
- What is the most
embarrassing thing

10:01.688 --> 10:02.906
that's ever happened to me?
- Oh, when you were

10:02.950 --> 10:04.342
cut out of that season
of "Real Housewives"

10:04.386 --> 10:05.953
where you were dating Ramona.
- I wasn't embarrassed.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.694
I was just disappointed
at the way it was handled.

10:07.737 --> 10:08.999
- Yeah.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.740
What is my least favorite word?

10:10.784 --> 10:12.220
- Buttress.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.438
- It just makes me picture
a mattress with a butt.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.049
- What is my least
favorite thing?

10:15.092 --> 10:17.660
- Meringue because it looks
so much better than it tastes.

10:17.704 --> 10:18.661
- It's a trick food!

10:18.705 --> 10:20.097
<i>♪</i>

10:20.141 --> 10:21.577
- Doug's up by one.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.144
Jake, you need to answer
the final question correctly.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.842
Otherwise, he wins.
Doug, lay it on him.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.191
- Hmm.

10:27.235 --> 10:30.760
Jake Peralta,
do I have an earring?

10:32.153 --> 10:33.545
- Um.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.025
What?
- You heard me.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.505
We've been in the car
for three hours.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.899
You've known me
for seven years.

10:38.942 --> 10:42.206
Do I have an earring?

10:42.250 --> 10:44.252
- Oh, no.
I'm drawing a blank.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.993
I can kind of picture
a diamond stud.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.255
- That'd be a good look.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.300
- Or maybe a gold cross
or a little hoop.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.954
- I do have versatile ears.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.653
- Now I'm just seeing it
pretty clearly with no earring.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.393
Ah, this is hard.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.831
But I'm gonna go with my gut
and say...

10:57.874 --> 10:59.354
yes, you do have an earring.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.705
Nothing but lobe?
This whole time?

11:02.749 --> 11:05.142
- Since the day we met.
-

11:05.186 --> 11:07.579
- I guess I know you better
after all.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.975
- Or do you?
- Wait, why are you smiling?

11:12.019 --> 11:13.847
- Because we played you!

11:13.890 --> 11:16.284
If you actually knew me,
you would have known

11:16.327 --> 11:18.547
that I only agreed to do
"Who Knows Mo', Friend Or Foe,

11:18.590 --> 11:19.722
Are You Fo' Real
Or Just Fo' Show?"

11:19.766 --> 11:21.811
in order to stall.
- I was in on it.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.334
"Estelle Minderman"

11:23.378 --> 11:24.988
is the code word we use
for when there's a twist,

11:25.032 --> 11:27.687
because when Estelle hosts game
night at the Senior Center,

11:27.730 --> 11:31.516
she always makes sure one
of the games has a sexy twist.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.736
- And when I was writing
my answers into my phone,

11:33.780 --> 11:35.564
I was secretly texting
Captain Holt

11:35.607 --> 11:37.348
our vehicle description
and location.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.394
Backup is already on the way.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.918
Wait,
why are <i>you</i> smiling now?

11:41.962 --> 11:43.093
- Because I played you.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.965
I knew you would text
for backup.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.923
So I changed your contacts
while I was DJ-ing.

11:46.967 --> 11:50.579
Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill,
really a lot of Taylor Swift.

11:50.622 --> 11:51.754
So when you were texting
Captain Holt,

11:51.798 --> 11:54.322
you were actually texting
Trudy Judy.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.932
- State troopers
are on their way.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.629
Sincerely, Raymond Holt.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.370
- Now my crew knows exactly
where we are

11:59.414 --> 12:01.285
and exactly what we're driving.

12:01.329 --> 12:04.680
Because I know you mo'.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.725
Slurp, slurp.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.079
- What do we do?
We can't outrun Doug's men.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.776
Boyle bus tops out at 50.
-

12:13.820 --> 12:15.604
I'm calling Holt for help.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.475
- Go for Trudy.
- Oh, damn it!

12:17.519 --> 12:18.781
- Yeah, I changed
all the numbers.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.740
- Come on.
Charles, give me your phone.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.830
All right, all right.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.919
- Peralta, what's going on? <i>
- Sir, I need your help.</i>

12:25.962 --> 12:28.138
Doug Judy tricked me and now
his crew knows our location

12:28.182 --> 12:29.749
and they're on their way
to help him escape.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.315
- Hey, Captain Holt.
- Doug says hi.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.404
- How many times have I warned
you not to trust that man?

12:33.448 --> 12:34.884
<i>- A lot of times.</i>

12:34.928 --> 12:36.712
But honestly, you tell me
not to do things so often,

12:36.756 --> 12:38.279
I kinda just tune it out.

12:38.322 --> 12:39.759
<i>- If Doug Judy escapes,</i>

12:39.802 --> 12:41.499
I can't help you;
you will be fired.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.805
<i>- Okay, I know I messed up.</i>

12:42.849 --> 12:43.980
But can you at least
get us some backup?

12:44.024 --> 12:45.329
- Send me a pin
of your location.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.070
I'll have state troopers
rendezvous with you.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.680
<i>Do Judy's men know
what car you're driving?</i>

12:48.724 --> 12:53.250
- Yes. They--no.
Not for long.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.338
- What the hell is this?

12:54.382 --> 12:56.601
- This is the front
of a Galaxie 500

12:56.645 --> 12:57.907
welded to the back of a Datsun

12:57.951 --> 12:59.517
with half its windows
and no trunk.

12:59.561 --> 13:00.562
It's all I could afford.

13:00.605 --> 13:01.563
- You really think you're gonna

13:01.606 --> 13:02.651
make it to the prison in that?

13:02.694 --> 13:03.826
- Well, we only have
38 miles left.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.219
So sorry, Judy,

13:05.262 --> 13:07.787
but it looks like I have
the upper hand now.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.314
- Door fell off.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.925
So what you want to talk about?

13:15.969 --> 13:17.884
- Nothing.
We're not talking anymore.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.189
No. No, no, no.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.278
No phone call for you.
- She's calling for you.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.889
- Yeah, it was gonna be
another fun road trip surprise.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.934
But you don't deserve it.
- Sup, Rosa?

13:24.978 --> 13:27.850
<i>- ♪ Judy,
Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy ♪</i>

13:27.894 --> 13:29.460
- No, no, no, no, there's no
singing for him now.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.897
<i>- But you made me learn
such a long song.</i>

13:30.940 --> 13:32.855
<i>It has 35 verses
and no chorus.</i>

13:32.899 --> 13:35.336
- I know. I'm sorry.
But plans have changed.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.077
<i>- Let me guess. Doug wasn't
excited about prison</i>

13:37.120 --> 13:38.078
<i>and now he's trying to escape?</i>

13:38.121 --> 13:39.557
- Yes.
- You know it.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.037
<i>-
Good luck, Doug.</i>

13:41.298 --> 13:44.867
-
Thank you for planning that.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.608
What's the next surprise?
- There isn't one.

13:46.651 --> 13:47.870
You ruined it.
There's no more fun.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.132
- So that's how it is?

13:49.176 --> 13:50.699
When it's gonna end
with me in prison,

13:50.742 --> 13:52.048
we can have a good time.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.745
But now it's gonna end with me

13:53.789 --> 13:55.312
riding off into the sunset
a free man,

13:55.356 --> 13:56.487
and we're all moody?

13:56.531 --> 13:57.749
- You're not escaping.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.229
And if you did,
I would lose my badge.

13:59.273 --> 14:00.883
- Maybe it's for the best.
You'd make a dope realtor.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.406
- I don't want to be a realtor.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.886
- You're telling me you don't
want to sell a penthouse

14:03.930 --> 14:06.193
to Zayn Malik and then party
with him afterwards?

14:06.236 --> 14:09.283
- I mean...
that does sound kind of cool.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.806

It still doesn't give you
the right to get me fired.

price to pay for my freedom.

physically overwhelm him.
