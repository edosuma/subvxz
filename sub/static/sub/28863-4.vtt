WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:06.040
(scissors clicking)

00:12.846 --> 00:14.815
Exquisite.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.418
Remember fun?

00:17.451 --> 00:21.255
Fun. Enjoyment, amusement
or lighthearted pleasure.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.491
"The children were having fun
in the play area."

00:23.524 --> 00:28.028
Yeah, I mean, like,
us having fun.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.430
You and me.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.933
I remember details, facts.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.402
(sighs)
Sounds boring.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.207
I miss Cary.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.243
Do you do that? You miss people?

00:42.276 --> 00:45.679
Currently tabulating
the Taiwanese stock market,

00:45.713 --> 00:47.081
tending to lunar
agriculture colonies

00:47.115 --> 00:49.283
and landing seven jumbo jets.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.520
Everyone is so different.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.990
I don't like it. It's like
we're all... grown-ups.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.495
Forget it.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.065
I guess I just miss him.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.800
Or me.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.403
Us.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.804
(Ptonomy choking)

01:10.838 --> 01:12.473
Are you okay?

01:13.941 --> 01:16.144
Narrative compromised.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.246
Temporal glitch.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.981
Glitch. G-Glitch.

01:21.014 --> 01:24.218
What is happening?

01:24.252 --> 01:27.288
So much data.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.490
So much history.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.759
All lost.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.801
My mustache.

01:40.834 --> 01:45.239
What did they do to my mustache?

01:45.273 --> 01:47.275
What the hell is happening?

01:49.109 --> 01:53.080
You're saying that something
is wrong with time?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.649
Kerry?
Something's wrong with time?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.285
-Who said that?
-You did.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.452
When?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.788
Just now.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.192
Ptonomy.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.693
That's what he said.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.162
He said that something
is wrong with time.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.702
It's David.

02:14.735 --> 02:18.005
His time traveler.

02:18.038 --> 02:21.842
We're-we're being attacked.
We need Cary.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.845
-Me?
-No, no, the male Cary.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.880
But he's not...

02:33.654 --> 02:35.022
Don't.

02:35.055 --> 02:38.192
(echoing giggling)

02:38.226 --> 02:40.228
Go. Get out.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.263
(clock ticking)

02:44.898 --> 02:46.900
(distorted giggling)

02:59.613 --> 03:03.083
ALL:
Three, four, go back for more.

03:03.116 --> 03:06.153
Five, six, hit the bricks.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.323
Seven, eight, don't be late.

03:09.357 --> 03:12.893
Nine, ten, pig in a pen.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.596
-One, two...
-(laughter)

03:15.629 --> 03:18.399
(Lenny humming)

03:19.800 --> 03:23.337
-Oh.
-What?

03:23.371 --> 03:25.673
She wants to join in.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.342
(chuckles)

03:28.376 --> 03:30.544
How do you know she's a she?

03:30.578 --> 03:32.513
I mean, we're girls.

03:32.546 --> 03:36.717
And when girls get together,
they make a girl.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.553
Science.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.755
God, you are so smart.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.425
-You make me smart.
-(chuckles)

03:47.328 --> 03:49.930
What do you think
we should name her?

03:49.963 --> 03:52.132
Another fish name?

03:52.165 --> 03:55.469
-A fish what?
-You know, like "Salmon."

03:55.503 --> 03:57.638
(laughs)
No, silly.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.773
Salmon's not a fish.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.776
It's a color.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.846
-Hmm.
-Maybe we call her Violet.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.320
Or Violence.

04:12.353 --> 04:16.657
Violence... Lollipop Busker.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.761
-It's got a ring to it.
-(laughs)

04:20.794 --> 04:24.097
-What do you think?
-Mm-hmm.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.473
ALL:
Five, six, hit the bricks.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.975
Seven, eight, don't be late.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.512
Nine, ten, a pig in a pen.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.947
One, two...

04:39.980 --> 04:41.349
Hey.

04:41.382 --> 04:45.353
I was thinking, um...

04:45.386 --> 04:48.622
I was thinking of putting in
my two weeks' notice.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.291
You know? Hitting the streets.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.960
What do you think?

04:54.528 --> 04:58.298
Want to give Violet
a good old-fashioned road birth?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.835
You mean leave?

05:01.869 --> 05:05.373
But you're the Breakfast Queen.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.877
Well, maybe it's lunchtime.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.914
I go where you go.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.018
-(chuckles)
-(distorted shouting)

05:19.152 --> 05:20.854
(David grunts)

05:20.888 --> 05:23.223
(panting) No.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.225
No. We have to go back.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.994
Hey, squirt, you got a little...

05:27.027 --> 05:28.462
I have to warn her. My mother.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.230
Do the-- do the hand,
make the door.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.632
We have to try again.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.502
(grunts) No.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.970
No. We have to go back.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.572
Hey, squirt, you got a little...

05:38.606 --> 05:40.674
I have to warn her. My mother.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.976
Do the-- do the hand,
make the door.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.378
We have to try again.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.246
Something's not right. We...

05:46.279 --> 05:48.916
(grunts) No.

05:48.949 --> 05:52.319
No. (panting)
We have to go back.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.021
Hey, squirt, you got a little...

05:54.054 --> 05:55.889
I have to warn her. My mother.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.325
Do the-- do the hand,
make the door.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.193
We have to try again.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.263
Stop! (panting)

06:03.296 --> 06:06.934
We've done this before.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.036
Is it an attack?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.237
It is a phenomena.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.539
What is that?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.040
Computer records
across the globe.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.542
All corrupt.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.376
Time code, code.
Time code.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.511
VERMILLION 1:
And in space.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.513
The orbiter and distant probes.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.781
PTONOMY:
The problem is universal.

06:20.814 --> 06:24.051
Say more about that.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.386
We think of time as
a unified field.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.456
Gravity affects it.
But nothing else.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.724
But something is changing time.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.627
Individualized time.
Localized time.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.328
This.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.409
Cool.

06:49.443 --> 06:52.546
AUTOMATED VOICE:
System breach.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.247
This is how he does it.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.584
CLARK:
Wha-- Who?

06:56.617 --> 06:59.419
-David.
-System breach.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.189
This is how he destroys
the world.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.526
System breach.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.262
-Shut it off.
-Error.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.298
This is how he does it.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.266
CLARK:
Wha-- Who?

07:13.300 --> 07:14.668
SYD:
David.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.970
This is how he destroys
the world.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.608
(exhales)

07:20.641 --> 07:21.942
Shut it off.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.444
This is how he does it.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.513
(distorted):
Shut it off.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.515
(static crackling)

07:43.797 --> 07:45.799
*

07:56.910 --> 07:58.879
(birds chirping)

08:06.053 --> 08:10.423
-(singing in foreign language)
-(baby cooing)

08:13.761 --> 08:16.229
(singing in foreign language)

08:23.370 --> 08:24.972
-(door closes)
-LENNY: Hey, kid.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.975
They're ready for you.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.844
(water flowing)

08:42.956 --> 08:44.958
Everything okay?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.537
(chuckles) Is that a "yes"?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.943
(inhales deeply)

09:02.976 --> 09:04.878
(exhales)

09:04.912 --> 09:08.181
Hello, my Snoopys.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.084
My Sigmunds.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.753
My Howdy Doodys.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.022
ACOLYTES:
Hi, Daddy.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.924
Are you happy?
I hope you're happy.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.425
ELOISE:
Happy, Daddy.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.428
-So happy.
-DAVID: Daddy had a hard day.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.064
A bad day.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.767
He made a big mess.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.202
Are you mad at Daddy?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.804
-ACOLYTES: Hell no!
-LENNY: No, Daddy.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.572
We're not mad.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.142
But we got a little bit of
a problem here with the clock.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.810
And I got a family to protect.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.111
DAVID:
We've all got family.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.814
We are family.

09:41.849 --> 09:45.585
Now that we're calm, tell me,

09:45.619 --> 09:47.921
what happened back there?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.023
Why did time loop like that?

09:53.927 --> 09:56.496
In the Hall of Time...

09:56.529 --> 09:58.231
there are demons.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.468
Wait, demons?

10:01.501 --> 10:03.937
SWITCH:
I call them demons. EmÃ³.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.906
But maybe they're just
the animals of time.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.240
Predators.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.810
Okay. In the future,

10:09.843 --> 10:12.980
if there are time demons,
tell me about the time demons.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.547
Sorry.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.552
(sighs)

10:20.988 --> 10:23.156
Tell me about the demons.

10:23.190 --> 10:27.027
They live in the space
outside of time,

10:27.060 --> 10:29.429
but they are always trying
to find a way in.

10:29.462 --> 10:34.001
I can hear them
when I'm traveling.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.804
They... giggle.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.473
What do they look like?

10:40.507 --> 10:43.310
I don't know.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.512
Like cats maybe.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.948
Blue cats.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.983
But instead of playing
with mice,

10:50.017 --> 10:53.153
they play with time.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.188
And they eat it.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.991
(acolytes murmuring)

10:58.025 --> 11:01.461
Hey, tranquillo, my beauties.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.497
Do you think Daddy won't
protect you?

11:04.531 --> 11:06.900
That's what a daddy does.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.668
ACOLYTES:
We love you, Daddy.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.805
-But we're scared.
-ELOISE: Yeah, we're scared.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.340
Make us feel good.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.642
ACOLYTES:
Please!

11:15.675 --> 11:18.445
(chuckles)

11:23.350 --> 11:25.352
(acolytes sighing blissfully)

11:32.359 --> 11:35.763
(chuckles)

11:35.796 --> 11:38.331
Dude, enough with the ego-jerk.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.534
Okay? We all wanna sleep
with you.

11:41.568 --> 11:45.072
So stop with the boo-hoo
and give me a plan.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.440
Careful.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.042
Right, 'cause that's
my specialty.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.444
DAVID:
Just use a different tone, okay?

11:51.478 --> 11:55.082
Be nice. I need you to be nice,
or I can't be nice.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.284
LENNY:
Shit. I don't want you
to be nice.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.286
I want you to get mad.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.855
Yeah, I want you to use
your almighty powers

12:01.889 --> 12:03.690
to save our asses, okay?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.625
So chop-chop, mama's boy.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.660
Get to work.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.447
Well, all right.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.749
Look at us talking.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.619
Working things out.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.154
You want honest?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.422
Here's honest.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.493
I'm gonna fix this.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.095
Whatever it takes.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.097
Whatever the universe
throws at me.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.333
Division 3, time demons.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.836
Send them all.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.971
I'll slay 'em all.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.440
'Cause this is my time.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.576
This is... David's time.

12:56.609 --> 13:00.613
And he's got...
things to do, so...

13:02.782 --> 13:05.752
Switch?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.220
Switch.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.925
How are you? Are you okay?

13:11.959 --> 13:15.128
I lost another tooth.
When we were in there.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.130
Yeah, it really
takes its toll, huh?

13:17.164 --> 13:19.867
Here's the thing. I'm gonna
need you to take me back.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.301
-Not far.
-I don't--

13:21.334 --> 13:23.103
I don't think I can
do another...

13:23.136 --> 13:25.105
You're not gonna lose
any more teeth, okay?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.874
I can feel them all loosening.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.708
Just show me where these things
are so that I can...

13:28.741 --> 13:30.043
And the more we go back,

13:30.077 --> 13:33.113
the more doors we open, the more
agitated they'll become.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.483
They'll swarm out, like wasps,
and pretty soon

13:36.516 --> 13:38.818
-everything...
-Do I have to force you to...

13:39.987 --> 13:42.555
(distorted giggling)

13:42.589 --> 13:45.092
What did you just say to me?

13:48.528 --> 13:51.098
I said I am the alpha
and the omega.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.735
I eat monsters for breakfast.

13:58.205 --> 14:01.875
(echoing giggling)

14:01.909 --> 14:04.277
(clock ticking)

14:06.179 --> 14:08.181
(giggling continues)

14:12.185 --> 14:14.421
(chuckles):
I do not like that.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.688
Is that...?

14:15.722 --> 14:16.990
(whispers):
They're here.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.059
*

14:19.092 --> 14:21.094
Even better.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.931
Run.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.333
(exhales)

14:26.366 --> 14:28.902
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.010
Oh!

14:37.044 --> 14:38.878
Big boy.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.282
(giggling continues)

14:45.986 --> 14:47.387
(faint squeaking)

14:53.493 --> 14:55.828
Wanna dance?

14:56.829 --> 14:58.565
Let's dance.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.502
(clock stops ticking)

15:07.607 --> 15:08.641
(yells)

15:08.675 --> 15:10.310
(thunder rolling)

15:12.412 --> 15:14.381
(woman humming eerie melody)

15:14.414 --> 15:16.416
(man speaking indistinctly
in distance)

15:18.318 --> 15:20.320
(gasps softly)

15:24.191 --> 15:27.027
(woman continues humming)

15:34.601 --> 15:36.603
WOMAN:
Jew or gypsy?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.139
What?

15:39.172 --> 15:41.241
Or homosexual?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.410
(liquid dripping)

15:43.443 --> 15:45.145
DAVID:
I...

15:45.178 --> 15:48.248
I don't understand.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.784
This is who they round up, no?

15:51.818 --> 15:54.354
Political enemies?

15:54.387 --> 15:56.956
Deviants and lunatics.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.592
Where am I?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.661
What year is this?

16:04.064 --> 16:06.699
It's the beginning of the end.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.873
Mommy?

16:33.393 --> 16:35.962
What's that stuff for?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.997
It's what I'm gonna use
to get you to tell me

16:38.031 --> 16:39.199
where Jenny Rerorg is.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.235
Your turn to play bad cop?

16:42.269 --> 16:43.670
Nah.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.273
Good cop and bad cop
left for the day.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.809
I'm a different kind of cop.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.411
Your turn to play bad cop?

16:51.444 --> 16:53.213
Nah.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.215
Good cop and bad cop
left for the day.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.016
(grunting)

16:57.050 --> 16:58.151
You're the police!

16:58.185 --> 17:01.554
(echoing giggling)

17:01.588 --> 17:04.191
FAROUK:
I've heard of this beast.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.894
Time Eaters,
who live in gravity wells.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.262
Black holes.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.264
The laws of time
don't apply to them.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.032
They live in black holes?

17:13.066 --> 17:15.702
-Uh, I mean...
-Yes. Think of time as the wood

17:15.735 --> 17:19.439
in the house, and they are like
termites living underground.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.242
-David must have let them out.
-How do we fight them?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.010
We can't. Not here.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.512
They're too powerful.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.680
We have to go
to where they sleep

17:27.714 --> 17:29.582
and kill them there: the nest.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.419
CLARK:
Well, where do we go,
and how do we get there?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.053
FAROUK:
To the Time Between Time.

17:34.087 --> 17:37.457
There's a rift
in the astral plane.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.792
(fading):
An imperfection.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.828
It has been sealed...

17:49.236 --> 17:51.704
Bombs, knives, guns?
What do I need?

17:51.738 --> 17:54.374
Courage and luck.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.309
(exhales)

17:56.343 --> 17:57.444
Wait. Where's Sy...

17:59.646 --> 18:01.648
*

18:13.460 --> 18:15.462
*

18:40.953 --> 18:42.689
GIRL:
We're flying.

18:42.722 --> 18:46.659
I thought we were in a building.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.296
It's an airship.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.631
It's not a plane, really.
More like a zeppelin.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.833
-How'd you get here?
-I don't know.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.868
I was in my room.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.108
I had a dress like that.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.976
When I was...

19:09.081 --> 19:11.518
Wait, what's your name?

19:11.551 --> 19:12.985
Sydney.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.854
Sydney Barrett.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.493
(exhales)

19:20.527 --> 19:22.562
I need a drink.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.572
-(drink pouring)
-Can I have one?

19:32.605 --> 19:34.707
How old are you?

19:34.741 --> 19:36.576
Fifteen?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.177
Sixteen.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.322
You still dating Tommy Vitore?

19:49.356 --> 19:50.857
Or is it the Halsey brothers?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.425
How do you know that?

19:53.860 --> 19:56.263
I'm you.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.898
In the future. Hi.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.468
You're me in the future?

20:02.435 --> 20:04.170
In a zeppelin.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.772
It's an airship.

20:07.073 --> 20:10.042
Remember our first drink?

20:12.645 --> 20:15.248
Whiskey?

20:15.282 --> 20:18.418
From that leftover glass
at the salon?

20:18.451 --> 20:20.920
Nine years old...

20:20.953 --> 20:23.556
and everything got swimmy?

20:28.895 --> 20:31.331
No, just one-- you're a minor.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.769
Am I dreaming?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.472
If you're lucky.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.774
And if I'm not?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.846
Then time is collapsing.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.618
Pretty soon none of us
will be anything at all.

21:10.202 --> 21:13.973
(thumping)

21:14.006 --> 21:16.643
(echoing giggling)

21:19.679 --> 21:21.814
(Cary whistling melody)

21:25.952 --> 21:28.455
(resumes whistling)

21:31.290 --> 21:32.759
(resumes whistling)

21:32.792 --> 21:34.894
(ticking)

21:36.896 --> 21:38.365
(faint creaking)

21:41.834 --> 21:43.736
(resumes whistling)

21:50.176 --> 21:51.678
(chuckles softly)

21:51.711 --> 21:55.181
(resumes whistling)

21:55.214 --> 21:57.216
(clock ticking)

21:59.919 --> 22:01.921
(squishing)

22:05.725 --> 22:07.727
Oh, my.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.978
(muffled grunting)

22:26.012 --> 22:27.980
DAVID:
This is good.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.883
-You want to do this.
-CARY: I do?

22:30.917 --> 22:32.585
DAVID:
You will.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.522
(indistinct whispering)

22:37.924 --> 22:39.358
Let me lead.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.637
(whispers):
Treachery.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.740
(beeping)

22:56.375 --> 22:58.377
(insects trilling)

23:09.422 --> 23:11.424
Hello?

23:13.926 --> 23:15.728
(echoing giggling)

23:22.502 --> 23:24.504
(giggling continues)

23:30.443 --> 23:31.944
(clinking nearby)

23:31.978 --> 23:34.346
*

23:48.695 --> 23:50.763
-(panicked yelling)
-Oh.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.900
(sow grunting)

23:53.933 --> 23:55.301
(low growling)

23:56.536 --> 23:58.905
SWITCH:
Psst.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.773
(whispers):
Hide.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.812
-(whispers):
What are we hiding from?
-Come.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.781
They eat time.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.817
-They eat time?
-Shh!

24:12.952 --> 24:15.522
It's okay.
I'm here to rescue you.

24:18.658 --> 24:21.193
(speaks Chinese)

24:21.227 --> 24:23.229
What?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.866
You're the... time girl, right?

24:26.899 --> 24:29.301
-Woman.
-Uh, woman, yeah.

24:29.335 --> 24:32.505
I was under David's influence,
you see, but then...

24:32.539 --> 24:35.374
it was as if, uh...

24:35.407 --> 24:38.444
as if the moments of my...
indoctrination

24:38.477 --> 24:39.879
were extirpated--

24:39.912 --> 24:41.648
they were...

24:41.681 --> 24:45.184
shorn from me, as it were.

24:45.217 --> 24:48.855
I can't begin to imagine
what he's done to you,

24:48.888 --> 24:50.623
our mind reader.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.692
But fret not.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.260
You're safe now.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.898
You... you want me
to come with you?

24:58.931 --> 25:01.668
Where we're going,
you won't have to hide.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.341
(door creaks)

25:25.291 --> 25:27.694
Don't!

25:27.727 --> 25:29.729
It's frozen there.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.399
Time.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.737
If you touch them...

25:40.072 --> 25:41.708
Then I freeze, too.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.910
So, how do we...

25:43.943 --> 25:46.378
(giggling in distance)

25:51.918 --> 25:53.419
The tunnel.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.756
(panting)

26:09.669 --> 26:10.870
(distant whimpering)

26:10.903 --> 26:11.871
(grunts)

26:11.904 --> 26:13.272
Don't worry.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.874
I'm gonna get us out of here.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.576
(panting)

26:17.610 --> 26:18.811
(rumbling)

26:21.080 --> 26:22.649
(rumbling resumes)

26:22.682 --> 26:26.085
(groans, whimpers)

26:26.118 --> 26:28.120
(panting)

26:29.121 --> 26:31.123
Oh Mommy.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.094
GABRIELLE:
I called for my mother, too,

26:35.127 --> 26:36.663
when they caught me.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.231
Where am I?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.733
Is this Germany?

26:40.767 --> 26:42.669
I don't even know
where you're from.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.305
I'm Roma.

26:46.338 --> 26:47.807
My family.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.309
Gypsies.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.144
We move always,

26:52.178 --> 26:54.814
from country to country.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.817
Since before there were borders.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.755
Do you have siblings?

27:02.789 --> 27:05.557
Parents? Grandparents?

27:06.558 --> 27:08.961
Doesn't matter now.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.697
We're all gonna be erased.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.631
It matters to me.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.701
It's my history.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.535
There is no history.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.570
For us.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.140
When we're gone,

27:21.173 --> 27:23.109
no one will ever know
we existed.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.144
(man shouts in distance)

27:28.014 --> 27:30.216
No.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.384
No, I can fix this.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.986
I have a friend.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.822
Is your friend God?

27:35.855 --> 27:37.289
(chuckles)

27:37.323 --> 27:38.290
No.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.459
She can move through time.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.861
I can go back.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.896
I can change the past.

27:45.564 --> 27:47.466
Then change this.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.702
Free the prisoners.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.738
Raise the dead.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.242
No, this is...

27:56.275 --> 27:58.745
It's not about the world.
This is about me.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.046
(chuckles)

28:00.079 --> 28:01.513
I see why they brought you here.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.682
You're a madman.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.918
No, I'm not.

28:05.952 --> 28:07.586
Listen to me.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.355
You're gonna have a baby.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.357
After this. The camps.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.559
In the hospital, you'll meet
a man and fall in love.

28:13.592 --> 28:14.560
And you'll have a baby.

28:14.593 --> 28:15.561
And...

28:15.594 --> 28:17.229
Listen to me. This is...

28:17.263 --> 28:18.831
You'll have a baby,

28:18.865 --> 28:21.834
and your husband will say
he has to go on a trip.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.235
Don't let him. He can't go.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.270
Do you understand?

28:24.303 --> 28:26.238
Hey.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.809
It's okay.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.912
I'm crazy, too.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.616
No.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.419
I'm not crazy.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.455
Something was taken from me.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.291
My life was taken from me.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.860
It is not your fault,
but you can stop this.

28:47.894 --> 28:51.430
When the time comes,
you can save my life.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.465
Please.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.902
Remember this.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.737
When you hold me...

28:58.771 --> 29:01.073
when you sing that song,

29:01.107 --> 29:03.275
you think of me.

29:03.309 --> 29:06.745
Think of your David,

29:06.779 --> 29:09.281
and save my life.

29:09.315 --> 29:12.384
I always liked that name.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.586
David.

29:14.620 --> 29:17.423
(breathing shakily)

29:24.263 --> 29:25.965
No.

29:25.998 --> 29:29.301
(panting)

29:32.671 --> 29:35.107
Lies.

(giggling)

30:18.550 --> 30:21.553
(giggling)

30:22.554 --> 30:25.224
Stop smiling!

30:27.026 --> 30:29.028
*

30:40.072 --> 30:41.507
(zapping)

31:13.940 --> 31:16.275

(squishing)

31:29.221 --> 31:31.623
(insect buzzing)

31:36.963 --> 31:39.098
(canvas flaps)

31:39.131 --> 31:41.300

31:41.333 --> 31:44.070

Psst. Psst!

32:24.276 --> 32:26.612
-(indistinct chatter)
-(horn honks)

32:27.646 --> 32:30.049
It's all right. It's all right.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.953
-Hold that.
-Okay.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.560
(beeping)

32:43.495 --> 32:45.297
(dialing)

32:45.331 --> 32:47.299
(whirring)

32:47.333 --> 32:49.735
(phone ringing)

32:52.071 --> 32:53.639
Hello?

32:53.672 --> 32:55.541
Sir,

32:55.574 --> 32:57.309
this is the male Loudermilk,

32:57.343 --> 32:59.878
requesting emergency
drop ship extraction.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.647
Latitude is...

33:01.680 --> 33:03.315
71 degrees north.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.051
Longitude is gonna be...

33:05.084 --> 33:08.054
Error message 181.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.322
-Error?
-Error message 181.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.459
System re--
system reboot required.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.495
181 is a time code error.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.233
Time is everywhere.

33:21.267 --> 33:23.001
Manual override.

33:23.035 --> 33:25.337
User code Alpha Jeremy 7.

33:25.371 --> 33:26.905
(dial-up modem blaring)

33:28.207 --> 33:30.576
Engage temporal failsafe
on my mark.

33:30.609 --> 33:31.877
Three, two, o...

33:32.911 --> 33:34.880
Oh. Oh, good.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.348
All systems back online.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.684
-New time codes issued.
-Already?

33:38.717 --> 33:40.419
Well, wow.
That-That's great.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.654
SWITCH:
We're losing time.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.856
I don't know
how much faster I could, uh...

33:44.890 --> 33:47.326
No. It's a couple minutes now.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.061
A few hours.

33:49.095 --> 33:52.498
What if they eat a thousand
year-- a thousand years?

33:52.531 --> 33:56.068
Or take us back
to the age of the dinosaurs?

33:56.102 --> 33:59.037
How do we fight them
if we were never born?

34:01.407 --> 34:05.111
Query: are they malevolent
or just hungry?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.378
What does that mean?

34:06.412 --> 34:08.114
He's asking
if these beasts are sentient.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.381
-Yeah.
-Do they have an agenda?

34:09.415 --> 34:10.716
Or are they animals feeding?

34:10.749 --> 34:11.783
Calculating.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.229
-Um, Ptonomy?
-Calculating.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.131
You said that.
How much longer will that...

34:25.164 --> 34:26.565
Estimated time of calculation:

34:26.598 --> 34:28.900
three years, two months
and nine days.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.637
(chuckling)

34:31.670 --> 34:33.672
Three years?

34:44.250 --> 34:45.384
(both laughing)

34:45.417 --> 34:48.120
So, if you're me in the future,

34:48.154 --> 34:51.123
then does that mean
that this is my future?

34:51.157 --> 34:52.724
(chuckling)

34:52.758 --> 34:55.127
-Yeah. Maybe.
-(chuckles)

34:55.161 --> 34:59.431
Or maybe you'll make different
choices now that you've seen me.

34:59.465 --> 35:00.999
Like staying brunette?

35:01.032 --> 35:02.934
Very funny.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.771
You know, last year,

35:05.804 --> 35:08.440
I was Syd in the past.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.509
But I never got to meet her.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.844
Me.

35:12.878 --> 35:15.514
If I did, I would have asked her
the same question

35:15.547 --> 35:17.015
that you want to ask me.

35:17.048 --> 35:19.618
What question?

35:19.651 --> 35:23.989
Who teaches you to be normal
when you're one of a kind?

35:27.326 --> 35:30.496
What... am I?

35:38.003 --> 35:41.540
People get too close.

35:41.573 --> 35:45.143
They touch you
and you disappear.

35:45.177 --> 35:47.979
And then they're inside.

35:48.013 --> 35:50.982
In your belly and in your head.

35:51.016 --> 35:55.487
And when you get back,
there's a smell.

35:55.521 --> 36:00.125
Someone else's smell
is inside your nose.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.028
And you check out.

36:03.061 --> 36:05.864
You tell people,

36:05.897 --> 36:08.300
"It's fine.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.802
I don't own my body."

36:10.836 --> 36:13.038
You say,

36:13.071 --> 36:16.875
"My power is like a vacation.

36:16.908 --> 36:21.112
I get to be a tourist
in someone else's life."

36:24.115 --> 36:26.352
Who cares if...

36:26.385 --> 36:30.589
every time I come back home,
I feel dirty?

36:32.558 --> 36:34.760
I just want to be left alone.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.928
I know.

36:36.962 --> 36:40.165
People die of loneliness, too.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.434
They drink too much.

36:43.569 --> 36:46.071
Slit their own throats.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.812
I went to the shower.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.216
Mom was asleep on the couch,
and...

36:58.250 --> 37:01.320
I went to the shower.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.424
You were curious.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.626
I just wanted to feel something.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.601
And he...

37:15.634 --> 37:18.270
turned me around.

37:20.005 --> 37:23.008
Why did he turn me around?

37:24.009 --> 37:26.578
Power.

37:26.612 --> 37:29.948
I thought sex was about love.

37:30.949 --> 37:33.819
It can be.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.288
That was it.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.924
The first time.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.959
My only time.

37:43.194 --> 37:46.298
People talk about sex, and...

37:46.332 --> 37:50.369
all I think about is having
my face pushed into wet glass.

37:51.437 --> 37:54.205
How is that romantic?

37:59.144 --> 38:01.112
Does it get better?

38:03.148 --> 38:05.150
You fall in love.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.620
(chuckles softly)

38:08.654 --> 38:11.256
And that's worth it.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.692
To feel that feeling.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.461
Do we get married?

38:15.494 --> 38:17.329
It's complicated.

38:17.363 --> 38:20.031
I'm not a kid.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.067
(sighs):
Uh...

38:23.569 --> 38:25.371
He has powers.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.205
But he's unstable.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.975
And for a while, it's magic.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.979
(quietly):
Magic.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.049
And then...

38:38.083 --> 38:40.919
-What happened?
-You had a bad dream.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.990
...he turned me around.

38:48.994 --> 38:52.364
So we find a desert island
and live alone.

38:53.399 --> 38:55.300
I think about that, too.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.202
Giving up.

38:57.235 --> 38:59.471
(chuckles) It's not giving up.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.740
It's what you wrote.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.180
I know.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.385
I'm afraid.

39:15.421 --> 39:17.889
If I hug you,
do we switch places?

39:45.951 --> 39:47.953
*

40:12.944 --> 40:15.213
(gasping)

40:15.246 --> 40:17.315
(screams)

40:20.752 --> 40:21.787
-(roars)
-(screams)

40:29.461 --> 40:31.463
Fishy?

40:34.032 --> 40:36.001
Fishy?

40:36.034 --> 40:39.037
Where'd you swim off to?

40:47.445 --> 40:49.515
Babe!

40:49.548 --> 40:52.250
(clock ticking)

40:52.283 --> 40:54.620
(distorted giggling)

40:54.653 --> 40:58.089
(Salmon screaming)

40:58.123 --> 41:01.159
Hey. Hey. Hey.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.595
It hurts!
Is it supposed to hurt so much?

41:03.629 --> 41:06.498
-Um, push, right? Remember?
-(whimpers)

41:06.532 --> 41:07.966
-(panting)
-You got to push.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.467
This is it. Push.

41:09.501 --> 41:10.802
-(Lenny exhaling)
-(Salmon whimpering)

41:12.838 --> 41:14.940
(screaming)

41:14.973 --> 41:16.875
-(baby crying)
-(Lenny gasps)

41:16.908 --> 41:20.278
My Queen. We did it.

41:20.311 --> 41:23.248
(baby crying)

41:32.524 --> 41:36.528
Mommy, I made that for you.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.166
-Bullshit!
-Oh.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.470
What is?

41:45.503 --> 41:47.639
That this is all we get.

41:47.673 --> 41:48.974
-Mom?
-(Lenny gasps)

41:49.007 --> 41:50.709
-Do you want to hold her?
-(baby coos)

41:50.742 --> 41:53.178
(Lenny laughs)

41:53.211 --> 41:56.147
-No. No. No!
-Mom.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.916
She's tough.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.918
Stubborn.

41:59.951 --> 42:02.554
Listens to me...

42:02.588 --> 42:04.590
and then does the opposite.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.861
I guess it runs in the family.

42:11.429 --> 42:13.431
(both laugh)

42:18.103 --> 42:20.939
Mom.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.974
You came.

42:24.910 --> 42:26.912
Of course I did.

42:28.914 --> 42:31.583
Thank you.

42:31.617 --> 42:34.352
For what?

42:34.385 --> 42:37.455
Always being there for me.

42:37.488 --> 42:39.490
(crying)

42:44.429 --> 42:46.431
*

42:49.801 --> 42:51.803
(clock ticking)

42:57.943 --> 42:59.911
(whimpers)

42:59.945 --> 43:02.547
(screaming)

43:02.580 --> 43:06.417
* I seen the demons *

43:06.451 --> 43:10.121
* But they didn't make a sound *

43:10.155 --> 43:13.124
* They tried to reach me *

43:13.158 --> 43:16.127
* But I lay upon the ground *

43:16.161 --> 43:18.964
* I reached for feelings *

43:18.997 --> 43:23.134
* But they didn't make a sound *

43:23.168 --> 43:25.236
* They tried to reach me *

43:25.270 --> 43:27.405
* But I lay upon the ground... *

43:27.438 --> 43:29.307
(growling)

43:29.340 --> 43:32.778
* So, miles and miles
of squares *

43:32.811 --> 43:35.146
* Where's the feeling there? *

43:35.180 --> 43:36.514
(distorted giggling)

43:36.547 --> 43:39.417
* Still nobody cares *

43:39.450 --> 43:42.654
* For miles and miles
of squares *

43:42.688 --> 43:44.322
* Daydream *

43:44.355 --> 43:47.625
* I fell asleep
amid the flowers *

43:49.627 --> 43:51.196
* Daydream *

43:51.229 --> 43:53.498
* I fell asleep
amid the flowers *

43:53.531 --> 43:55.166
(Farouk whistles)

43:55.200 --> 43:57.703
* I seen the demons *

43:57.736 --> 44:01.873
* But they didn't make a sound *

44:01.907 --> 44:03.975
* They tried to reach me *

44:04.009 --> 44:07.112
* But I lay upon the ground *

44:07.145 --> 44:09.881
* I seen the people *

44:09.915 --> 44:13.518
* But they didn't make a sound *

44:13.551 --> 44:16.788
* They tried to reach me... *

44:16.822 --> 44:19.457
(screaming, distorted chatter)

44:19.490 --> 44:21.326
Something's wrong with time?

44:24.896 --> 44:26.297
-(sighs)
-(distorted giggling)

44:26.331 --> 44:27.999
What are you?

44:28.033 --> 44:29.434
It doesn't matter.

44:31.402 --> 44:33.204
Ah. You know what?

44:33.238 --> 44:35.373
Eat all the time you want.
I'll get it back.

44:35.406 --> 44:37.242
'Cause you're not real.

44:37.275 --> 44:39.144
Nothing that hurts me is real.

44:39.177 --> 44:42.047
No one who hates me is real.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.681
(giggling)

44:43.715 --> 44:45.817
* For miles and miles
of squares... *

44:45.851 --> 44:47.352
Acts of God.

44:47.385 --> 44:49.254
* Daydream *

44:49.287 --> 44:51.489
* I fell asleep
amid the flowers... *

44:51.522 --> 44:53.024
I am God.

44:53.058 --> 44:55.560
* Daydream *

44:55.593 --> 44:58.063
* I fell asleep
amid the flowers. *

45:01.066 --> 45:02.934
Oh, now you're listening.

45:02.968 --> 45:04.535
Well, listen to this.

45:04.569 --> 45:06.537
You want to eat something?

45:06.571 --> 45:08.006
Eat shit.

45:08.039 --> 45:10.441
Now go tell your friends
it's not your time.

45:10.475 --> 45:12.177
It's mine.

45:12.210 --> 45:13.378
Go.

45:15.914 --> 45:18.750
Or I kill every one of you.

45:20.752 --> 45:21.987
What am I?

45:24.322 --> 45:25.957
(growling)

45:37.803 --> 45:39.604
(ticking)

45:42.007 --> 45:44.009

(Lenny crying)

46:11.336 --> 46:13.939
-How bad?
-(groans)

46:19.144 --> 46:21.112
Let me help you.

46:21.146 --> 46:23.148
(sniffles) No.

46:25.150 --> 46:27.152
I need to feel it.

46:38.864 --> 46:40.866
(crying)

46:48.173 --> 46:50.075
ALL:
Daddy!

46:53.178 --> 46:55.713
Stop.

46:55.746 --> 46:58.549
Stop. Stop!

47:05.823 --> 47:07.325
(sighs) Where's Switch?

47:07.358 --> 47:10.195
-Switch?
-She's gone, Daddy.

47:10.228 --> 47:11.629
What do you mean, she's gone?

47:11.662 --> 47:13.631
He took her.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.633
The scientist.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.669
Cary took her?

47:21.572 --> 47:23.541
No, no, no!

47:23.574 --> 47:26.177
(loud rumbling)

47:26.211 --> 47:28.346
(inhales)

47:28.379 --> 47:31.516
(exhales)

47:31.549 --> 47:33.551
War.

47:36.687 --> 47:39.891
* When the world *

47:39.925 --> 47:42.928
* Is a monster *

47:48.099 --> 47:53.104
* Bad to swallow you whole *

47:59.077 --> 48:03.048
* Kick the clay that holds *

48:03.081 --> 48:07.252
* The teeth... in *

48:10.321 --> 48:13.191
* Throw your trolls *

48:13.224 --> 48:15.560
* Out the door *

48:15.593 --> 48:18.997
* Door, door, door *

48:20.631 --> 48:22.900
* I've been there *

48:22.934 --> 48:26.437
* Can't get there from here *

48:26.471 --> 48:28.606
* I've been there *

48:28.639 --> 48:32.077
* Can't get there from here *

48:32.110 --> 48:34.312
* I've been there *

48:34.345 --> 48:37.949
* Can't get there from... *

49:39.810 --> 49:41.246
MAN:
Now I get it.
