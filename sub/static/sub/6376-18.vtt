00:01.301 --> 00:02.562
<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:02.602 --> 00:04.968
<i>Hey, Austin.
Just leaving another message.</i>

00:05.005 --> 00:06.666
Don't really know how you're feeling.

00:07.073 --> 00:08.472
Here, the candy...

00:10.310 --> 00:11.572
<i>Tyler is not
who you think he is.</i>

00:11.611 --> 00:12.703
<i>Who is he, then?</i>

00:12.746 --> 00:15.078
- He's your brother.
- So who's the father? Huh?

00:15.115 --> 00:17.413
And now you tell me
there's some little bastard out there

00:17.450 --> 00:19.816
who could just waltz in here
and demand his cut.

00:19.886 --> 00:22.150
It's Meade.
I want the whole damn company.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.485
No more Nice Willie.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.787
Tyler? I'm Wilhelmina Slater.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.724
- They're gone?
- Betty, you look great.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.901
You may now kiss the bride.

00:46.813 --> 00:49.509
What, are you stepping out on me
before our wedding?

00:49.549 --> 00:55.419
I guess it's a little hard to tell us apart
now that I'm not wearing braces.

00:55.722 --> 00:59.055
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay, enough monkey business.

00:59.092 --> 01:02.118
<i>Baby, according to
How to Plan a Wedding in 60 Days,</i>

01:02.162 --> 01:04.858
we were supposed to have a wedding
photographer, like, last week.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.332
"Based on the popular blog. "

01:07.367 --> 01:09.494
This woman turned her blog
into a book.

01:09.536 --> 01:12.437
Meanwhile, I haven't even posted
in over a month

01:12.472 --> 01:14.337
because I've been so busy at work.

01:14.374 --> 01:15.773
Well, I hope you haven't been too busy

01:15.809 --> 01:17.777
to plan my bachelorette party
this weekend.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.608
Hey, I got my party planned.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.240
Booze, boobs,
and a bus to Atlantic City.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.213
- You're traveling?
- Yeah.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.310
Why does he get to travel?
I want to travel!

01:27.353 --> 01:29.287
Travel is the part
that you have a problem with?

01:29.322 --> 01:31.654
<i>Ay, please,
like he's gonna do better than this.</i>

01:31.691 --> 01:34.455
- That's right.
- Anyway, maid of honor,

01:34.494 --> 01:36.553
what fun thing are we doing?

01:36.596 --> 01:41.260
Well, get ready,
because I have scored us

01:41.301 --> 01:46.466
a private,
after-hours champagne tour at the Met!

01:49.375 --> 01:51.434
Get out of here!

01:51.478 --> 01:54.743
- That's a good one! The Met!
- The Met?

01:54.781 --> 01:58.148
That would have been
the worst bachelorette party ever!

01:58.184 --> 02:01.278
Right? I know.

02:01.621 --> 02:05.079
I was keeping the real party a surprise.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.855
- Okay, good.
- You're gonna love it!

02:09.562 --> 02:11.051
See you later.

02:11.698 --> 02:14.929
Hey, Justin. You want a ride to school?

02:14.968 --> 02:17.596
No, sorry, I'm walking with Austin.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.837
Justin doesn't walk.

02:19.873 --> 02:23.036
He's told me 1,000 times,
"Shoes are for fashion, not function. "

02:23.076 --> 02:25.977
I know.
You know, we used to be friends.

02:26.012 --> 02:30.278
I don't know what's up with him lately.
Maybe I did something wrong.

02:30.483 --> 02:34.385
You're about to be his new stepfather.
That's got to be weird for a kid.

02:34.921 --> 02:36.821
- You know what? This weekend...
- Yeah, that's true.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.848
...you guys go
and do something fun together.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.383
That's a good idea.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.493
And that is my parents in a nutshell.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.764
I don't mean to keep harping on this,

02:54.807 --> 02:58.573
but you don't have any news
tracking down my father, do you?

03:00.547 --> 03:02.310
Actually, I do.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.806
I just learned that the rehab facility
where we met shut down,

03:05.852 --> 03:08.082
and those records can't be retrieved,

03:08.121 --> 03:12.922
so we'll never be able to find him.
I'm so sorry, Tyler.

03:13.459 --> 03:17.691
It's okay.
So, I was conceived at a rehab facility.

03:17.730 --> 03:21.097
I guess
I was destined to be an alcoholic.

03:21.134 --> 03:24.661
I don't think we should joke about that.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.569
Have you spoken to Daniel yet?

03:26.606 --> 03:30.167
I tried, but he doesn't want
anything to do with me.

03:31.578 --> 03:35.036
I hate that you're leaving so soon and
you two never got to know each other.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.515
It's fine.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.519
I came to meet you,
and that part worked out.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.292
Oh! I could take Hilda horseback riding
for her bachelorette party.

03:48.328 --> 03:51.354
Or better yet? Naked horseback riding.
You're welcome.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.389
- Gross. And, ow!
- Well, I'm out of ideas then.

03:54.434 --> 03:57.267
- Well, all of your ideas involve nudity.
- You're welcome.

03:57.303 --> 04:02.104
Stop saying that.
An e-mail from the trapeze school.

04:02.141 --> 04:05.440
A thousand dollars?
Come on, that was my favorite option.

04:05.478 --> 04:07.309
This totally sucks.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.417
- Are you talking to me?
- No, I was talking to...

04:12.018 --> 04:14.145
- Never mind.
- So, what sucks?

04:14.187 --> 04:16.587
I have to plan the perfect
bachelorette party for my sister

04:16.623 --> 04:19.387
and nothing is working out.
It's just really disappointing.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.620
Well, I know disappointment.

04:21.661 --> 04:26.291
My half-brother hates me and I have
no hope of finding my biological father.

04:26.332 --> 04:29.358
Okay. Perspective.

04:30.403 --> 04:33.429
Well, if it helps,
I've known Daniel for years.

04:33.473 --> 04:36.533
And if you just give him time,
he'll come around.

04:44.884 --> 04:48.820
If you'll excuse me, I have to go
deal with something annoying.

04:50.857 --> 04:53.724
- I see you.
- So...

04:54.594 --> 04:56.289
What, are you on Team Tyler now?

04:56.329 --> 04:59.389
No, Daniel, I'm not on team anyone.

04:59.432 --> 05:02.993
Tyler is not a bad guy.
Put yourself in his shoes.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.266
Shoes?
More like smelly old cowboy boots.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.502
- Okay, you're five years old.
- No, you're five years old.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.009
Someone needs a nap.
We'll talk about this later.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.878
Fine. But I'm putting you down
for Team Daniel.

05:17.450 --> 05:23.320
As requested,
here is some clothing from the mall.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.219
Now, I'm not one to pry,

05:28.261 --> 05:30.729
but you didn't exactly specify
what this is all for.

05:30.763 --> 05:35.291
It's for an important meeting that I can't
be seen wearing cashmere and furs.

05:35.335 --> 05:39.999
Mysterious. Still not prying, but would
this meeting have anything to do

05:40.039 --> 05:42.507
with your plan
to overthrow the Meades?

05:42.542 --> 05:46.876
Yes. It involves Claire's recently
revealed love child, Tyler.

05:46.913 --> 05:52.010
Oh, he's such a rube. And he's so hot.
Must he be a part of all this?

05:52.051 --> 05:55.714
He's just a pawn.
The weak link in the Meade chain.

05:55.755 --> 05:59.122
I gain his trust,
everything else falls into place.

06:01.260 --> 06:05.720
Willie's being all weird again.
And you're being...

06:05.765 --> 06:09.223
British. I'm trying to look authentic
for my trip to London with Daniel,

06:09.268 --> 06:11.065
but it feels like I'm missing something.

06:11.104 --> 06:15.302
- A riding crop? A horse? Dignity?
- Wow. Somebody's jealous.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.275
Yeah, I'm jealous.
You get to go all the way to London,

06:17.310 --> 06:20.040
and I have to stay here and figure out
who I'm gonna take as my plus one

06:20.079 --> 06:23.276
- to Hilda's stupid straight wedding.
- Why don't you bring your boyfriend?

06:23.316 --> 06:26.251
Oh, my God, I totally forgot,
I have that boyfriend, Trey.

06:26.285 --> 06:29.186
- Troy.
- I like Trey better. Or Trevor.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.248
We'll talk about it,
I'm sure he'll want to weigh in.

06:33.359 --> 06:36.851
You're going to the London
Fashion Week, Daniel? Really?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.557
There are some big designers there.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.158
You call it the training bra
of fashion weeks.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.896
And you're only ever interested
in the big, sexy ones.

06:43.936 --> 06:45.403
So, why are you going?

06:45.438 --> 06:47.463
Is this one of those times
where you ask me a question

06:47.507 --> 06:49.236
that you already know the answer to?

06:49.275 --> 06:51.903
The answer is,
you don't need to be there.

06:51.944 --> 06:55.345
You're just going to avoid
this whole thing with Tyler. Am I right?

06:55.381 --> 06:56.905
You know what?
I hate it when you know me.

06:56.949 --> 06:59.679
So, send someone in your place
and stay here.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.710
Reach out to your long-lost half-brother

07:01.754 --> 07:03.688
who traveled across the country
to meet you,

07:03.723 --> 07:07.022
- who you've been nothing but a jerk to.
- Okay, fine.

07:07.059 --> 07:08.924
Fine. But who's gonna go to London?

07:08.961 --> 07:10.690
- You?
- No, I can't go.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.891
I have to stay
and plan Hilda's bachelorette party.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.923
I still have no idea what I'm gonna do.

07:14.967 --> 07:20.030
She wants something big
and exciting and fun, but with travel.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.434
- Wait a second.
- I can't believe it!

07:24.477 --> 07:27.105
A bachelorette trip to London!
Oh, my gosh!

07:27.146 --> 07:29.410
I thought your party
was gonna be so lame-ass!

07:29.449 --> 07:32.077
- Hey!
- But it turns out it's gonna be bad-ass!

07:32.118 --> 07:34.348
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!
- Yeah!

07:34.387 --> 07:37.618
- Suck on that, Talercio!
- Suck on it!

07:37.657 --> 07:41.616
- Suarez sisters are going to London!
- London!

08:17.396 --> 08:20.263
Oh, my God, we're in London!

08:20.299 --> 08:21.926
Ms. Suarez, welcome.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.298
Oh, you know my name.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.032
Of course.
We're very honored to have you here.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.506
Oh, my God,
you are totally famous here!

08:28.708 --> 08:31.040
Please wait, I'd like to tip you.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.442
I'm sure I have a few extra pounds
in here somewhere.

08:33.479 --> 08:37.472
Somewhere? What about here,
and here, and here?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.813
- And right about here.
- Hey!

08:38.851 --> 08:41.410
You are working for her this week.
Can you be nice?

08:41.453 --> 08:42.818
Betty!

08:46.692 --> 08:49.126
- She looks so elegant!
- I know.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.063
Eyes up, you dozy choob!

08:52.098 --> 08:55.329
Hey! Watch where you're going.
- Yeah, yeah, stick it up your fish pipe!

08:55.368 --> 08:57.768
There's the drunk I remember.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.332
Look at you! No braces!

09:02.375 --> 09:05.811
Look at you!
How's Stuart and the baby?

09:05.845 --> 09:07.745
They're good. But they're at home,

09:07.780 --> 09:09.645
so how soon can we get a drink
in this mama's hand

09:09.682 --> 09:11.047
and get this hen night started?

09:11.083 --> 09:13.517
Well, there's an opening night
cocktail party in, like, 30 minutes.

09:13.553 --> 09:18.752
Right-o! Cheerio!
Oh, my God, I sound like a local, right?

09:18.791 --> 09:19.883
- Right.
- Yeah, right?

09:19.926 --> 09:22.520
- Let's go.
- You're getting married!

09:23.563 --> 09:27.363
These past few months
have been the most challenging.

09:27.400 --> 09:32.394
Away from home, and my family,
and my routine.

09:34.006 --> 09:36.065
I've actually been slipping up a lot.

09:36.108 --> 09:40.511
And I've got to say that things can
get pretty dark when I drink.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.142
But I'm thankful that I can come here
for your support.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.757
I see a new face in the back.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.853
Will you please stand
and introduce yourself?

10:03.469 --> 10:08.429
My name is Wilhelmina S.
And I'm an alcoholic.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.003
Hi, Wilhelmina.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.602
You know
I love hanging out at your house,

10:13.646 --> 10:16.114
playing video games, watching movies.

10:16.148 --> 10:20.141
But do you think we should go
somewhere else some time?

10:20.186 --> 10:22.154
What, like your house?

10:22.521 --> 10:24.614
Like on a date. Is that weird?

10:24.657 --> 10:29.651
No. No, not at all. I love it.
You know, our first real date.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.095
- How about tomorrow night?
- What are we gonna do?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.000
- I'll surprise you.
Hey! What's up, J?

10:37.036 --> 10:38.663
Hey. Hi, Bobby.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.065
You know that
my mom is in London, right?

10:41.107 --> 10:42.972
Yeah. Exactly. That's why I'm here.

10:43.009 --> 10:46.968
Listen, I'm thinking we have
a special bachelor party for me.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.607
- Suarez men only. Tomorrow night.
- All right.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.210
Sounds like fun,
but Austin and I have plans.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.983
But don't let me stop you and Grandpa
from, you know, tearing up the clubs.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.651
Can you change your plans?
This is important.

10:59.692 --> 11:02.160
- I don't really think...
- It's cool. We can do it another time.

11:02.194 --> 11:04.719
- Hey, thanks, Austin.
- All right!

11:04.764 --> 11:08.928
Tomorrow night,
the Three Amigos vs. The big city.

11:08.968 --> 11:12.335
- I'm so sorry.
- Big city, look out.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.000
Hidey ho, bitches!
Hey, where'd that bag come from?

11:19.045 --> 11:21.809
I rifled through your stuff earlier
and it was not in there.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.838
The designer
had it messengered to me.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.181
I could get used to that.

11:26.218 --> 11:30.052
As the designated bachelorette,
I call dibs on the next freebie.

11:30.089 --> 11:35.220
So sorry to interrupt. I just had to
tell you I loved your last show.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.258
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.558
Cheers.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.693
Okay, that was, like, the third person
who's come up to you.

11:43.736 --> 11:45.931
- Do they think you're Judi Dench?
- I'm afraid not.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.599
You see, I had a little show here
about a month ago

11:48.641 --> 11:52.077
- and, well, some people kind of liked it.
- Come on.

11:52.111 --> 11:54.579
Wow. Christina,
your dreams came true.

11:56.115 --> 11:58.879
- That's not what I saw for you.
- I really need a break from her.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.944
- We're gonna go get a drink at the bar.
- Yep!

12:03.756 --> 12:05.018
Here we go, my dear.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.855
Oh, my God, Christina,
that's Lindsay Dunne!

12:07.893 --> 12:10.987
He's, like, the most powerful publisher
in all of Britain.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.328
- And he's coming this way.
- Christina.

12:13.365 --> 12:17.563
Mr. Dunne, good to see you.
This is my good friend, Betty Suarez.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.595
<i>She actually works at Mode magazine
as a features editor.</i>

12:20.639 --> 12:24.302
- Ms. Suarez, a pleasure.
- No, me.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.712
I mean, I am the pleasured one.

12:27.747 --> 12:32.275
Betty is a rising star, actually, and
she's clearly very excited to meet you.

12:32.985 --> 12:36.182
Well, I'm flattered. I'm always
on the lookout for a rising star.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.917
Okay.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.482
Would you be interested
in an opportunity to do more?

12:40.526 --> 12:42.084
More? What do you mean?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.153
<i>Well, one of
my fashion magazines, Ultramod,</i>

12:44.196 --> 12:46.357
has lost its New York-based columnist.

12:46.398 --> 12:49.026
Being that you're familiar
with the scene over there,

12:49.068 --> 12:51.832
would you have any interest
in interviewing?

12:51.871 --> 12:52.929
Oh.

12:52.972 --> 12:56.135
<i>- You could still keep your job at Mode.
- Wow.</i>

12:57.676 --> 13:00.702
That would be amazing. Yes.

13:00.746 --> 13:04.113
All right, then.
Call my office and set up a meeting.

13:08.154 --> 13:11.123
I have my work, which I love,

13:11.157 --> 13:14.752
but it cannot fill the void
of my estranged family.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.296
Thank you for sharing.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.758
Okay, everyone, see you next week.

13:25.237 --> 13:29.264
Ms. Slater. I had no idea.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.704
- Tyler, please call me Wilhelmina.
- Yeah.

13:35.681 --> 13:39.412
Well, I guess my little secret is out.

13:39.451 --> 13:42.511
I'd appreciate it if you would not
say a word to Claire or Daniel.

13:42.555 --> 13:47.492
Of course. And I know
how tough it is when you need to talk,

13:47.526 --> 13:49.221
and you can't turn to
the people around you.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.923
Well, thank God we have our sponsors.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.464
You do have a sponsor, don't you?

13:56.202 --> 13:58.261
Actually, since I've been here,

13:58.304 --> 14:00.204
I haven't been able
to connect with anybody.

14:00.239 --> 14:04.437
Well, don't say another word.
Consider Willie your sponsor.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.021
Would you like another scone?

14:18.390 --> 14:21.917
No. I can barely eat. I'm so excited
to go to these fashion shows.

14:21.961 --> 14:26.762
Hilda, a couple years ago I was lucky
to be standing behind a tent pole.

14:26.799 --> 14:30.291
And now, I mean, I don't want to get
my hopes up, but I might get a chair.

14:30.336 --> 14:34.363
Ooh! A chair! That means a gift bag.
And as your designated bachelorette...

14:34.406 --> 14:36.431
- Your name is already on it.
- Yay!

14:36.475 --> 14:40.172
Okay, we really have to leave.
A waiter has just come up to Amanda

14:40.212 --> 14:41.804
and asked her
if she wanted bangers and mash.

14:41.847 --> 14:45.146
- She followed him into the loo.
- Turns out it's just food.

14:45.951 --> 14:49.284
Okay, bachelorettes,
since I can't be with you,

14:49.321 --> 14:52.154
I have planned out the perfect day.

14:52.191 --> 14:56.890
Itineraries.
Maximizes historical sites, minimizes...

14:56.929 --> 14:58.590
Fun?

14:58.631 --> 15:02.431
I was going to say "travel time. "
They're just suggestions.

15:02.468 --> 15:05.164
And I promise I will catch up with you
as soon as I can.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.671
All right, but, Betty,

15:06.705 --> 15:09.469
you'd better not be late for my party
or I'm gonna be pissed.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.567
Hey, you know that
here that means "drunk. "

15:11.610 --> 15:13.237
That works, too.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.180
Take lots of pictures!

16:04.763 --> 16:08.062
So, how are things going
with the Meades?

16:08.300 --> 16:12.202
I was so touched by what you shared
about getting to know your family.

16:12.838 --> 16:16.035
Well, I'm actually going out tonight
with Daniel.

16:16.075 --> 16:19.567
- He wants us to get along.
- That's very noble of him.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.038
What is it?

16:24.283 --> 16:27.343
Well, I've just known the Meades
for a long time,

16:27.386 --> 16:31.186
and they're not the most forthcoming.

16:31.423 --> 16:34.586
Well, Claire's been totally straight
with me.

16:34.626 --> 16:37.220
I mean, just this morning
she was telling me about my father.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.287
How they met in rehab,

16:39.331 --> 16:43.427
and how she's done everything
she could to track him down for me.

16:44.803 --> 16:46.737
Tyler, can I be frank?

16:49.241 --> 16:51.300
They're terrified of you.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.906
- What?
- Well, it's true.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.780
As far as they're concerned, you're
just another claim to their empire.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.613
Well, I just want to get to know
my family.

16:59.651 --> 17:03.348
Well, I know that,
but I'm not as cynical as the Meades.

17:03.389 --> 17:07.655
I wouldn't be surprised if they tried
to pay you off just to get rid of you.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.627
Come on.
They wouldn't do that, would they?

17:12.364 --> 17:14.059
I've held my tongue long enough.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.589
I do own half this company, too,

17:15.634 --> 17:18.626
so it's time we talk
about Claire's bastard child.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.194
What are you talking about?

17:20.239 --> 17:22.469
You think this hayseed
crawled out of his corn crib

17:22.508 --> 17:25.772
and came all the way to Manhattan
just for a family reunion?

17:25.810 --> 17:29.611
Look, I'm no fan of the guy,
but I don't think Tyler's after our money.

17:29.648 --> 17:33.448
Daniel, are you that naive?
Take my advice.

17:33.485 --> 17:35.749
Take him out on the town
with his new big brother.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.280
Get him through a couple of velvet
ropes and make him feel like a big shot.

17:39.324 --> 17:41.189
Then write him a big, fat check

17:41.226 --> 17:44.525
and stick him
on the first train back to Hicksville.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.189
Well, you're probably right.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.100
Even the Meades
would never sink that low.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.632
Sugar?

17:56.241 --> 17:58.971
Trey. There you are. Hi, Trey.

17:59.278 --> 18:03.044
It's Troy. And you know I don't like it
when you pick new names for me.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.485
Actually, I didn't know that.
You're so complicated, Trevor.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.652
I'm sorry, I've been so busy lately.
I got this promotion, but you are in luck

18:12.691 --> 18:16.218
because I've got a wedding
this Saturday and you're my date.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.059
Actually, I'm seeing someone else now.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.726
- What? No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.259
Do you really care? You haven't
called me in, like, two months.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.864
- I said I was busy.
- Look, I get it.

18:27.906 --> 18:31.740
I know I came across a little stalkery
and you got freaked out.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.575
But you were my first boyfriend.
I was excited.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.309
- You used to sleep on my stoop.
- Okay, that was one time

18:37.349 --> 18:39.817
and that was because you kept saying,
"One minute, I'll be right down. "

18:39.852 --> 18:42.650
Then you never... You didn't show.

18:42.688 --> 18:45.521
So, I'm patient. There are worse traits.

18:46.191 --> 18:50.059
Anyway, now I'm with Brian,
so it all worked out.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.689
I'm sure you'll find someone, too.

18:58.871 --> 19:02.068
Whoa, my ears are
still ringing from that place.

19:02.107 --> 19:05.008
I couldn't even hear myself think.

19:05.043 --> 19:10.071
Wait, we've got a great plan B, though,
right? Pizza, beer, great company.

19:10.115 --> 19:12.208
Yeah, how about we find something
to watch?

19:12.251 --> 19:15.618
Good idea. Hey, Justin, you want to
help me pick out a movie?

19:15.654 --> 19:17.554
Betty's got a lot of great musicals here.

19:17.589 --> 19:19.420
Come on, Justin,
stop texting and join the party.

19:20.559 --> 19:24.461
Hey, one sec. I have to take this.

19:24.796 --> 19:29.358
But I think I'm just gonna go over
to Marc's, so I don't bother you guys.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.701
- Hey!
- Hey!

19:40.913 --> 19:44.405
I'm here, I'm all yours. No more work.

19:45.551 --> 19:49.112
Well, I might have to do
a little bit of work tomorrow.

19:49.154 --> 19:52.248
But who am I to complain?
Work is work, right?

19:53.759 --> 19:54.851
What are you guys doing?

19:54.893 --> 19:58.294
We decided that every time
you say "work," we drink.

19:58.897 --> 20:03.231
Okay, I get it.
Tonight is about fun, not work.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.304
- Drink!
- Drink!

20:08.006 --> 20:09.371
Mmm.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.104
Dare!

20:13.278 --> 20:15.974
- A brave choice.
- All right, all right, all right.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.515
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:17.549 --> 20:22.179
Okay, okay, I want you to flash that guy.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.250
- Yes!
- No!

20:25.290 --> 20:27.781
Betty, just do it.
Go show him your Mayan temples.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.260
- Go.
- No, I can't do that.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.058
Yes, you can. Watch.

20:36.668 --> 20:40.263
USA! USA! USA!

20:42.641 --> 20:44.609
See?
- No.

20:44.643 --> 20:49.046
Okay, I am the queen, I declare it.
I want you to flash that stranger!

20:49.081 --> 20:51.049
- No!
- Yeah! Go, go, go.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.449
Hey, come on, Betty!

20:54.620 --> 20:56.679
Okay, fine, I'll do it.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.296
Suarez!

21:25.851 --> 21:30.015
Everyone said, "When you go
to London, don't miss Betty's boobs. "

21:30.055 --> 21:32.546
I'm just glad there wasn't a line.

21:32.858 --> 21:35.349
- This is...
- Hilarious! Hi, Gio!

21:35.394 --> 21:36.793
What? I didn't get the shot, so...

21:36.828 --> 21:38.693
Hi, Gio. Let's just get
Cheech and Chong back out.

21:38.730 --> 21:39.856
- Yeah.
- Amanda!

21:39.898 --> 21:43.925
No, no, no, girls, girls, stop it! Turn her
around and let everyone have a look!

21:43.969 --> 21:46.733
Christina! Enough! Stop. Enough.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.235
You got us in trouble.

21:50.575 --> 21:54.136
I don't generally do these things often.
Or ever.

21:54.179 --> 21:56.670
Right, but when in Rome...

21:56.715 --> 21:59.650
Wait a minute. You didn't go to Rome
with me, did you?

21:59.685 --> 22:02.119
You chose what's-his-name.
Egg Salad.

22:02.154 --> 22:06.113
Henry. And to be fair,
I really didn't choose either one of you.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.059
- What are you doing here?
- Layover.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.927
On my way to Provence.
A food and wine trip. And you?

22:11.963 --> 22:13.521
<i>Mode sent me for work.</i>

22:13.565 --> 22:14.862
- Work!
- Work!

22:15.367 --> 22:19.394
Listen, I'd love to catch up, but I want
to see the London Eye before it closes,

22:19.438 --> 22:23.841
and I'm only here for one more night.
You want to check it out with me?

22:23.975 --> 22:25.909
No. I can't.

22:25.944 --> 22:29.573
It's Hilda's bachelorette party
and I can't just go, so...

22:30.615 --> 22:34.381
Can you just give us two seconds?
Two... Don't go.

22:34.419 --> 22:38.253
Okay. What are you doing?
Go with him.

22:38.290 --> 22:41.623
- What? Why?
- Betty, you are on vacation.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.322
You have been all about work
since you got here.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.764
You've got a really nice guy here
who has always been crazy about you.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.733
Go have an adventure!

22:49.768 --> 22:52.168
- He does look sort of good, doesn't he?
- Yeah.

22:52.204 --> 22:55.264
And you might have a plus one
for my wedding.

22:56.808 --> 22:59.333
- Go. Have fun!
- Okay.

23:01.046 --> 23:05.312
Good news. Queen Hilda
has granted me permission to go.

23:10.589 --> 23:13.524
Wow. It's like a club in here.

23:14.359 --> 23:15.986
Yeah, actually,
it used to have a stripper pole,

23:16.027 --> 23:17.790
but I guess it was too hard
to wear a seat belt

23:17.829 --> 23:20.423
and work the pole at the same time.

23:23.668 --> 23:28.435
Look, I just want you to know I'm sorry
about the way I've been treating you.

23:28.473 --> 23:33.410
It's just kind of freaky to suddenly
find out you have a half-brother.

23:33.879 --> 23:36.848
- Tell me about it.
- And then my mom, your dad...

23:36.882 --> 23:38.975
It's an image
I don't want stuck in my head.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.211
- Wait, my dad?
- Yeah.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.947
You know,
I never got along with Hartley,

23:41.987 --> 23:43.386
but I shouldn't have
taken that out on you.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.947
- So, you know my dad?
- Know him?

23:45.991 --> 23:48.118
He was the biggest pain in my ass
for, like, six months

23:48.160 --> 23:52.494
when he was trying to take over Meade.
Mom told you all that, I'm sure.

23:53.698 --> 23:57.225
I think we're here. You know what?
Just hang on a sec, all right?

23:57.269 --> 24:01.296
I'm gonna go grease the bouncer,
make sure we get VIP treatment.

24:02.574 --> 24:03.836
Be right back.

24:18.356 --> 24:20.187
Tyler? Everything all right?

24:20.659 --> 24:23.924
I think Claire might have lied to me
about who my father is.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.657
Really?

24:25.697 --> 24:28.894
She's been so nice to me since
I got here. Why would she do that?

24:28.934 --> 24:32.802
I don't know.
But a lie of that magnitude?

24:32.838 --> 24:37.172
If you could never forgive her,
it would be completely understandable.

24:37.375 --> 24:40.776
I'm out with Daniel right now
and this news...

24:41.980 --> 24:44.175
All I can think about is taking a drink.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.379
Slip-ups are inevitable, and it's okay.

24:47.419 --> 24:53.016
I certainly know how tempting
a perfectly-mixed cocktail can be.

24:53.058 --> 24:56.255
I can almost taste it right now.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.233
It's like a warm hug
going down my throat.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.533
What should I do, Wilhelmina?

25:05.904 --> 25:11.206
Oh, remember, if you happen to slip up,
I am always here for you.

25:12.043 --> 25:15.137
Because that's what a sponsor's for.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.956
I really love it here.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.298
At this one fashion show
they served a sandwich

25:37.335 --> 25:40.566
that was bread, butter,
and French fries.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.874
- That's disgusting.
- It was amazing.

25:42.908 --> 25:45.968
Carbs, fat, and carbs. It was a miracle.

25:46.011 --> 25:49.071
The miracle is you still eat like that
and look as good as you do.

25:49.147 --> 25:50.171
Oh.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.614
Thank you. You, too.

25:54.819 --> 25:58.277
It's so nice to actually see London.

25:58.323 --> 26:02.282
I've been stuck indoors
at fashion shows ever since I got here.

26:02.794 --> 26:06.230
- Yawn.
- No, not yawn. I really enjoyed it.

26:06.264 --> 26:08.664
- Double yawn.
- I'm serious.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.828
I saw two lines
that were completely innovative,

26:11.870 --> 26:14.771
and most of the rest of them
were surprisingly on-trend.

26:14.806 --> 26:20.210
Ooh, look at you.
You are a Modie robot. You're a Mobot.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.338
I am not a Mobot.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.178
"I am Betty. I am a Mobot.

26:25.216 --> 26:29.482
"I care about fashion. I am on-trend. "

26:29.521 --> 26:31.079
Okay, I know what this is.

26:31.122 --> 26:34.148
This is you doing
your little button-pushy, flirty thing

26:34.192 --> 26:35.989
- just to get to me.
- No, no, I'm not.

26:36.027 --> 26:38.086
- Yes, you are. You are flirting.
- I'm not flirting.

26:38.129 --> 26:40.757
"I am Gio. I am flirting. "

26:40.799 --> 26:41.891
I'm not flirting.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.800
It is okay. I am flirting, too.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.202
- Betty, I'm engaged.
- I am...

26:49.140 --> 26:50.539
What?

26:59.217 --> 27:03.210
Is it just me or is it weird that you didn't
mention you were engaged right away?

27:03.254 --> 27:06.052
Why? You disappointed?

27:06.091 --> 27:08.855
Hurts a little you can't have me,
doesn't it, Suarez?

27:08.893 --> 27:11.088
No, it doesn't hurt.

27:11.129 --> 27:15.088
I'm just saying
that if I were your fiancée,

27:15.133 --> 27:18.660
I would think it was weird that you
picked up your ex-girlfriend at a bar

27:18.703 --> 27:20.295
and took her on a romantic stroll.

27:20.338 --> 27:23.637
What? I did not pick you up.
You flashed me.

27:23.675 --> 27:27.611
It was a dare and I was supposed to be
flashing a complete stranger.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.012
<i>- Why are you still working at Mode?
- What?</i>

27:30.048 --> 27:31.447
What does that have to do
with anything?

27:31.483 --> 27:34.350
I thought you wanted to write
about things that mattered.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.547
Like that crap you put in your blog.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.613
What do you know about my blog?
What, you read my blog?

27:38.657 --> 27:42.024
Don't get all excited.
But yeah, I've read it.

27:42.060 --> 27:44.494
At least I did until you stopped posting.

27:44.529 --> 27:48.431
I know, I'm busy. I'm an editor now.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.198
And I'm interviewing to write a fashion
column for another magazine.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.837
Wow. That's a job
you never dreamed of.

27:57.676 --> 28:01.203
Fashion has been good to me, okay?

28:01.246 --> 28:04.340
And since I've been doing it for a while,
people actually respect me,

28:04.382 --> 28:07.010
as hard as that might be
for you to believe.

28:07.052 --> 28:10.078
And okay,
you know what, the perks are nice.

28:10.121 --> 28:12.351
- So, you've gotten comfortable.
- I'm not comfortable.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.881
- Oh, you're comfortable.
- Stop, Gio, don't.

28:14.926 --> 28:16.791
Don't do that thing that you always do.

28:16.828 --> 28:20.525
- The "I'm Gio, I'm always right! I'm... "
- I'm just saying that...

28:20.565 --> 28:22.396
- I'm just saying.
- "I know everything!"

28:22.434 --> 28:23.924
What was supposed to be
a stepping stone for you

28:23.968 --> 28:27.404
- has completely become your path.
- It's not my path.

28:28.606 --> 28:31.541
It's... Everything that I'm doing

28:31.576 --> 28:35.569
is just so that one day
I can create the magazine that I want.

28:35.613 --> 28:37.513
You sure about that?

28:37.549 --> 28:39.483
Because from where I'm standing,

28:39.517 --> 28:43.715
it seems like you're scared to
focus on what you really care about.

28:43.755 --> 28:45.484
And you're getting more
and more involved

28:45.523 --> 28:48.788
in something
that doesn't even matter to you.

28:49.194 --> 28:53.255
You know what, Gio?
I haven't even seen you in, like, years.

28:53.298 --> 28:56.495
And you show up and you think that
in one hour you know my entire life?

28:56.534 --> 28:58.764
Well, guess what? You don't.

29:05.844 --> 29:08.210
I have to go back to my sister.

29:14.285 --> 29:18.187
I think you'll like this place,
it's even better than the last one.

29:19.657 --> 29:20.988
Thanks.

29:22.827 --> 29:25.887
Hey, take it easy.
That's 50-year-old single malt.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.694
What, so I don't deserve
the good stuff?

29:31.169 --> 29:33.399
I realize you haven't had it easy,

29:33.438 --> 29:35.702
and I want you to know
that there's no way

29:35.740 --> 29:38.004
we're gonna send you home
empty-handed. Okay?

29:38.042 --> 29:40.943
- What?
- This is for you.

29:43.681 --> 29:46.582
- You got to be kidding me.
- No, no, I'm happy to do it, Tyler.

29:47.018 --> 29:51.546
- You're actually trying to buy me off?
- No, I'm trying to help.

29:51.589 --> 29:53.147
- Hey, what are you doing?
- All right, guys, come on.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.716
- Let's take it up the street, all right?
- No, no, no, we're fine. Listen.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.591
- Are you really that afraid of me?
- What?

29:57.629 --> 29:59.460
You think I'm gonna make problems
for you? Huh, rich boy?

29:59.497 --> 30:02.728
Tyler, take it easy.
You're missing... What are you...

30:02.767 --> 30:05.201
- Hey! Hey!
- Wait, wait, no, no, no, no.

30:05.236 --> 30:06.897
Tyler, listen...

30:10.775 --> 30:12.868
Christina,
you know what's really weird?

30:12.911 --> 30:15.072
You're, like, a big fancy designer
in London,

30:15.113 --> 30:19.209
- and I'm a big shot stylist in New York.
- You're a stylist now?

30:19.450 --> 30:21.247
Well, not in the sense
that I have any clients,

30:21.286 --> 30:23.686
but I do get to combine
all of my favorite interests:

30:23.721 --> 30:27.282
Criticizing people, shopping,
and promoting world thinness.

30:28.893 --> 30:31.987
Believe it or not, she really is talented.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.759
It's true, I am.

30:33.798 --> 30:37.234
Christina, this might be the beer,
and the Jäger,

30:37.268 --> 30:42.069
and the tequila talking,
but I'm really proud of you.

30:42.307 --> 30:46.209
- No, you're a big success.
- Thank you.

30:46.244 --> 30:50.044
<i>But you know,
I was really terrified when I left Mode.</i>

30:50.081 --> 30:53.608
All of a sudden I didn't have
a safety net. But you know what it did?

30:53.651 --> 30:57.587
It forced me to take a chance
on what I really wanted to do.

30:59.123 --> 31:00.488
- Hey, you're back!
- Hey!

31:00.525 --> 31:02.925
How was your time with Gio?

31:02.961 --> 31:05.691
It was a lot of work.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.357
- Work!
- Work!

31:14.505 --> 31:18.032
Oh, dear. Here. Eat this.

31:18.943 --> 31:22.572
I can't. I drank so much last night.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.481
I don't remember anything
after getting back to the pub.

31:25.516 --> 31:26.915
I know, neither do I.

31:26.951 --> 31:29.977
I vaguely remember calling
Billy MacDuff about 2:00 in the morning

31:30.021 --> 31:32.888
and telling him
that our first kiss tasted of sauerkraut.

31:34.192 --> 31:36.786
Do you not remember?
Seeing Gio made us have this idea

31:36.828 --> 31:38.762
to start calling up all our exes.

31:39.964 --> 31:44.298
Doesn't ring a bell.
I have to meet Mr. Dunne now.

31:45.370 --> 31:48.430
Are you sure you don't want to stay
just one extra day?

31:48.473 --> 31:50.998
Sorry, I miss my boys.

31:57.382 --> 32:00.044
Come on now, we're not gonna
get into a big thing here.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.985
We're far too good friends
to say goodbye.

32:04.789 --> 32:09.123
- Now, you go and kick ass.
- I will.

32:25.810 --> 32:30.144
Hey, just the guy I was looking for.
I got a surprise for you. You ready?

32:30.181 --> 32:33.412
Three words. Be. On. Cé.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.677
I scored two tickets for you and me

32:36.721 --> 32:39.451
to see Miss Bootylicious herself
tomorrow night.

32:39.490 --> 32:44.086
- What do you think?
- Wow, thanks, I just can't go with you.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.960
What are you talking about?
These tickets are unbelievable.

32:46.998 --> 32:48.625
I'm talking fifth row.

32:48.666 --> 32:52.158
Yeah, it's just Austin
and I already got tickets.

32:52.203 --> 32:56.264
And we're actually doing homework
right now, so I can't really talk.

32:56.307 --> 33:00.141
Hey, what if I got one more ticket?
We could all go together.

33:02.413 --> 33:06.076
Look, I changed my plans last night
for your bachelor party

33:06.117 --> 33:08.711
and I don't want to change them again.

33:08.753 --> 33:11.153
What's going on here?
I mean, I thought we were cool.

33:11.189 --> 33:15.421
You know, you going through
some teenage rebellion thing

33:15.460 --> 33:16.859
or you mad
that I'm marrying your mother?

33:16.894 --> 33:19.454
It's not about you, all right? Lt...

33:22.200 --> 33:24.725
I just... I can't go.

33:30.408 --> 33:33.206
Honestly, I was surprised
that she chose denim

33:33.244 --> 33:35.508
seeing as it's
an iconically American fabric,

33:35.546 --> 33:38.208
but the way she cut it
was completely European.

33:38.249 --> 33:41.480
Well, Ms. Suarez,
your materials are impressive,

33:41.519 --> 33:43.487
Christina speaks highly of you,

33:43.521 --> 33:46.388
and you're obviously passionate
about fashion.

33:46.424 --> 33:50.451
- Yes, I do. I mean, yes, I am.
- Good.

33:51.195 --> 33:55.859
This is the part of the job that I love,
making someone's dream come true.

33:55.900 --> 34:00.234
You are going to have front row seats
to every show in New York

34:00.271 --> 34:03.240
and access
to anyone you want to talk to.

34:03.274 --> 34:07.301
A go-getter like you should move up
through the ranks in no time.

34:07.345 --> 34:11.610
So, how does it feel to be adding
fashion columnist to your resume?

34:14.585 --> 34:17.815
- Ms. Suarez?
- I'm sorry.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.652
I can't do this.

34:24.094 --> 34:27.292
- I'm sorry?
- Fashion is not my dream.

34:27.565 --> 34:31.092
Well, it's an odd time
to be mentioning it.

34:31.135 --> 34:35.504
Yes, I know.
But the last 24 hours have been crazy.

34:36.574 --> 34:41.637
I flashed my ex in a bar,
and then he called me a Mobot,

34:41.679 --> 34:46.411
and I thought he was wrong,
but now I think he's right.

34:47.985 --> 34:50.476
- I'm following.
- No, you're not.

34:52.857 --> 34:57.419
I'm sorry.
I really appreciate this opportunity.

34:58.563 --> 35:03.296
But if you read my blog, you will see
what I really want to be writing about,

35:05.169 --> 35:07.000
and it isn't fashion.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.241
Thank you so much for your time.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.852
Yeah, I just don't... I don't get it.
He used to like me.

35:27.925 --> 35:30.155
Why am I so bad to hang around
all of a sudden?

35:30.194 --> 35:32.958
There's no explaining
teenagers, brother.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.957
Well, I even offered
to take his buddy, too.

35:37.001 --> 35:40.334
You know, I don't know
why he doesn't want me there.

35:41.839 --> 35:44.103
You're trying too hard, Bobby.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.111
Justin will come back to you
when he's ready.

35:47.778 --> 35:50.576
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.782
Hey, I'm gonna go talk to him.

36:19.744 --> 36:22.440
Hey, you know,
I was thinking about the concert.

36:22.480 --> 36:27.440
- You know, I mean, you guys can go.
- Just please don't tell anyone.

36:28.452 --> 36:30.977
- No. Of course not.
- Not even my mom.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.887
All right, yeah, I won't.

36:32.924 --> 36:37.554
- But, yeah, I think she'd be cool with it.
- I just don't want her to know.

36:37.628 --> 36:41.064
- All right, it's just between us.
- Okay.

36:46.971 --> 36:48.871
Thanks for meeting me.

36:49.507 --> 36:53.136
Lucky for you, I try to get to the airport
at the last possible minute.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.611
I hate that. I like to be there
two hours ahead of time

36:55.646 --> 36:58.376
to reorganize my carry-on.

36:58.416 --> 37:01.408
There she is.
There's the Suarez I know.

37:02.486 --> 37:05.353
Look, I'm sorry about last night.

37:05.389 --> 37:09.257
I think that I got a little over-defensive.

37:10.361 --> 37:13.387
- Because you made a good point.
- I know I did.

37:15.366 --> 37:16.628
- I didn't have to say that.
- No.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.567
- That was annoying, wasn't it?
- Yes.

37:18.603 --> 37:23.666
Anyway, I did what you said.
I turned down that job.

37:26.043 --> 37:29.774
I know it was the right thing to do,
but it's still scary.

37:29.814 --> 37:32.146
I mean, what if my blog
doesn't take off? What then?

37:32.183 --> 37:36.279
I mean, maybe I was on the wrong path,
but at least it was a path.

37:36.754 --> 37:41.350
You know, when you broke up with me,
I thought it was me.

37:41.392 --> 37:44.828
That I had to change myself.
And I went wild.

37:45.296 --> 37:48.959
I tried wraps, open-face,
all kinds of crazy stuff.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.795
But then I finally went back
to what was important to me.

37:53.037 --> 37:56.131
That was making sandwiches.
Bread-meat-bread.

37:56.474 --> 37:58.567
And then I met this girl,

37:58.609 --> 38:02.568
a baker who makes
the most amazing rustic sourdough.

38:03.547 --> 38:06.141
Our business took off,
we fell madly in love,

38:06.183 --> 38:08.708
all because we pursued our passion.

38:10.755 --> 38:14.316
Well, you seem happy.

38:15.693 --> 38:17.092
I am.

38:17.662 --> 38:20.790
But you were right, too.
I was flirting with you a little.

38:20.831 --> 38:23.265
- Really?
- Now, I didn't mean anything by it.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.598
I didn't.

38:27.071 --> 38:28.868
It's just our thing.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.640
Besides, I know there's only ever been
one guy for you.

38:32.677 --> 38:35.510
Okay, Gio,
can we not go down that path again?

38:35.546 --> 38:37.776
We were having a nice moment.

38:39.050 --> 38:42.281
You'll always hold a special place
in my heart, B.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.391
I can't believe you and Tyler
got arrested for fighting.

38:49.427 --> 38:51.054
Are you sure you don't know
where he went?

38:51.095 --> 38:53.222
Look, someone bailed him out
right before you got there.

38:53.264 --> 38:54.492
I didn't see who it was.

38:54.532 --> 38:56.864
- How did this happen?
- He just went crazy.

38:56.901 --> 38:59.131
You should have warned me
he was such an ugly drunk.

38:59.170 --> 39:03.664
You let him drink?
He's an alcoholic. He's in AA!

39:03.708 --> 39:06.336
Well, how was I supposed
to know that?

39:07.378 --> 39:10.677
Did he say anything?
What did you talk about?

39:10.715 --> 39:13.275
I don't know. His mother.

39:14.885 --> 39:17.718
- His hometown. Hartley and...
- What?

39:17.755 --> 39:18.813
I told him about his father.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.323
How Hartley tried
to take over the company,

39:20.358 --> 39:23.327
- how we forced him out.
- Oh, God.

39:24.395 --> 39:25.794
What is it?

39:27.231 --> 39:31.600
I swore to Cal that I would
never tell Tyler who his father was.

39:32.002 --> 39:36.598
So, I made up a story.
I told Tyler I met his father in rehab.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.835
Now he knows I lied.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.211
- Mom.
- What?

39:44.248 --> 39:46.409
I'm sorry, okay?

39:47.184 --> 39:50.483
It's gonna be all right.
I promise we'll find him.

40:02.533 --> 40:05.502
- Feeling any better?
- Yeah.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.132
Thanks for bailing me out last night.

40:09.173 --> 40:13.906
Well, I told you I would forgive you
if you slipped up.

40:13.944 --> 40:17.471
- I mean, it happens to the best of us.
- Yeah.

40:19.183 --> 40:22.482
You were right.
They tried to buy me off.

40:24.855 --> 40:29.258
They're terrified that I'm gonna try
to take what they've got.

40:29.660 --> 40:33.824
I'm so sorry.
My heart is breaking for you.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.566
What are you gonna do?

40:36.600 --> 40:39.899
I'm gonna take from them
what is owed to me.

40:42.306 --> 40:44.638
My share in Meade Publications.

40:44.942 --> 40:48.002
And I will support you any way I can.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.876
Marc, I'm back!

40:57.788 --> 41:00.313
- What happened to you?
- Everything.

41:00.357 --> 41:02.985
Troy broke up with me,
I ate two slices of pizza,

41:03.027 --> 41:05.188
and now I can't stop thinking about him.

41:05.229 --> 41:09.325
- Oh, my God. You ate pizza?
- I can't talk about it.

41:09.366 --> 41:11.994
Good, because I have
some really big news of my own.

41:12.036 --> 41:16.268
I think it's time for me to make
this stylist thing happen, for real.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.036
<i>I'm quitting Mode.</i>

41:20.911 --> 41:25.814
Oh! Good, you're here. I was just
dropping off my reviews of the shows.

41:25.850 --> 41:30.378
Thank you so much for sending us
to London. We had the best time.

41:30.421 --> 41:34.152
You can read all about it on my blog.
I just posted all the gory details.

41:34.191 --> 41:35.317
Gory, huh?

41:35.359 --> 41:38.192
Yeah, I sort of dropped the ball
on blogging for a while,

41:38.229 --> 41:41.756
so I thought I would re-launch
with something juicy.

41:41.799 --> 41:44.666
How did things turn out
with you and Tyler?

41:44.735 --> 41:46.669
Kind of blew up in my face.

41:46.704 --> 41:49.468
But at least I'm talking
to my mom again. Whoa!

41:49.507 --> 41:52.237
You flashed Gio in a bar?

41:52.276 --> 41:55.973
Yep! But, in my defense,
I had been drinking.

41:56.347 --> 41:59.646
And at least now I know
that all of my ex-boyfriend craziness

41:59.683 --> 42:01.173
is behind me.

42:02.820 --> 42:07.189
<i>Hey, it's Betty. Remember me?</i>

42:07.224 --> 42:10.785
<i>Anyway, I'm in London,
and I'm thinking about you.</i>

42:11.896 --> 42:14.831
<i>Sorry. That was a hiccup, not a burp.</i>

42:14.865 --> 42:16.628
<i>Anyway, Hilda's getting married,</i>

42:16.667 --> 42:20.660
<i>and I was just wondering if maybe
you'd want to come to the wedding.</i>

42:20.704 --> 42:23.298
<i>As my date. Call me.</i>
