WEBVTT

00:01.720 --> 00:02.719
Val of House El!

00:02.760 --> 00:03.591
You are hereby

00:03.760 --> 00:05.080
sentenced to death.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.675
Your family will now be
considered Rankless,

00:08.039 --> 00:10.475
without name,
without honor.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.353
No!
Grandpa!

00:12.520 --> 00:13.317
He's got a bomb!

00:13.480 --> 00:15.039
Death to the Voice of Rao!

00:15.640 --> 00:16.756
<i>You did a brave thing.</i>

00:17.040 --> 00:18.952
You are to be assigned
a new surname.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.753
My name.
Vex.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.792
We never ask for mercy.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.235
Do you understand, Lyta-Zod?

00:27.400 --> 00:28.436
Yes, mother.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.799
What the hell
were you thinking, Seg?

00:30.960 --> 00:32.314
You gonna un-cuff me or what?

00:32.840 --> 00:34.877
Nyssa here has yet
to be paired with someone.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.156
As my youngest daughter,

00:36.320 --> 00:37.480
you will be Binding with her.

00:37.880 --> 00:38.950
I'm happy for you.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.400
It's not like I want
to be a Vex.

00:40.560 --> 00:41.560
What's not to want?

00:41.640 --> 00:43.313
<i>You've got better food,
better air.</i>

00:43.520 --> 00:44.317
You're gonna be
one of them again.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.590
But not as an El.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.776
- Mom?
<i>- It's time you learn</i> ed

00:46.800 --> 00:47.800
the truth.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.240
<i>Your grandfather
was no traitor.</i>

00:49.440 --> 00:50.440
He was a hero.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.113
<i>My son didn't steal
the skimmer.</i>

00:52.320 --> 00:53.117
I did!

00:53.320 --> 00:54.913
Who was your accomplice,
Charys?

00:55.080 --> 00:55.911
It was me!

00:56.080 --> 00:57.080
No!

00:57.640 --> 00:58.471
No!

00:58.640 --> 00:59.915
<i>My name is Adam Strange.</i>

01:00.120 --> 01:02.396
Someone from the future
is coming to destroy Krypton.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.876
This belongs to your grandson,
Kal-El.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.639
Once this cape is gone,
our time's up.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.200
<i>This thing that's coming...</i>

01:08.360 --> 01:09.840
<i>It's known as
The Collector of Worlds,</i>

01:09.920 --> 01:11.912
<i>but its true name is Brainiac,</i>

01:12.080 --> 01:13.833
<i>and it seems your parents
gave their lives</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:16.037
<i>because they knew this threat
needed to be stopped,</i>

01:16.320 --> 01:19.119
and they believed
that you could stop it.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.637
Does this really belong
to my grandson?

01:36.520 --> 01:37.192
Yeah.

01:37.360 --> 01:39.192
Then why isn't he here?

01:39.960 --> 01:40.996
Why you?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.037
Uh, he sent me in his place.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.031
Kind of a big deal
where I'm from.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.760
Lot of reasons,
but mainly because

01:49.920 --> 01:51.320
I can teleport
across light-years

01:51.480 --> 01:53.200
using a little something
called a Zeta Beam.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.599
I know.
It's a cool name, huh?

01:58.720 --> 02:00.712
Came up with it myself.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.792
Only problem is, uh,

02:03.160 --> 02:05.231
one passenger per ride, me,

02:05.400 --> 02:08.996
and...
it's a little temperamental.

02:09.759 --> 02:11.035
You don't believe me.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.240
How do you think
that I got to this fortress?

02:15.080 --> 02:16.400
Do you...

02:16.560 --> 02:19.120
You think that I power-walked
across the ice to get here?

02:19.840 --> 02:23.390
Everything that I am
telling you is true.

02:24.920 --> 02:25.956
Trust me.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.816
Even if I did,
it wouldn't make a difference.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.435
Can't help you.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.595
What is the matter with you?

02:34.760 --> 02:36.216
Look, I don't know
what you expect of me,

02:36.240 --> 02:37.936
but I don't understand a thing
about all this.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.960
My parents died before
they could explain it to me.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.816
Great, then we can
figure this out together.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.080
I don't have time
to argue this.

02:43.640 --> 02:44.800
I have to get back to Kandor.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.956
Time?

02:46.160 --> 02:47.958
We don't have any.
Brainiac is coming,

02:48.120 --> 02:49.536
and he ain't waiting for you
to square away

02:49.560 --> 02:51.199
whatever it is
you think needs doing.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.196
Now, I am talking about
millions of lives,

02:54.400 --> 02:56.790
so get your head out of your
ass and into the game.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.880
I don't care what a big deal
you might be

02:59.040 --> 03:00.190
on the planet Detroit.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.317
This is Krypton.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.593
I gave you my answer.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.478
Guess I had the wrong guy.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.120
And it's Earth.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.280
Sorry?

03:15.880 --> 03:17.394
I'm a big deal on Earth,

03:17.640 --> 03:19.552
not planet Detroit.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.120
Well, I suggest

03:21.200 --> 03:22.873
you get on your beam
and get back there.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.639
There's someone
I need to deal with.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.870
Wait!

03:28.360 --> 03:29.760
Do you think that I could just

03:30.360 --> 03:31.760
get a ride back to the city?

03:35.520 --> 03:37.079
<i>So this guy you're so eager
to see...</i>

03:37.240 --> 03:38.993
<i>- Daron-Vex.
- Yeah, him.</i>

03:39.160 --> 03:40.400
<i>You say he's
the chief what now?</i>

03:40.760 --> 03:42.194
<i>City's chief magistrate.</i>

03:42.640 --> 03:44.438
Chief magistrate, huh?

03:44.600 --> 03:45.920
Guy like that probably has

03:46.120 --> 03:47.336
a bunch of valuable information

03:47.360 --> 03:48.714
right at his fingertips.

03:48.880 --> 03:49.711
Strange, just don't.

03:49.880 --> 03:50.711
I'm just saying,

03:50.880 --> 03:52.109
if you were curious,

03:52.280 --> 03:53.714
you could probably
use this guy,

03:53.920 --> 03:55.718
gain access to the city's
deep space sensors,

03:55.920 --> 03:57.136
which I promise you,
will show you

03:57.160 --> 03:58.719
a big, ugly, organic life form

03:58.920 --> 04:00.115
headed this way.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.336
If you want to honor
what your parents died for,

04:03.360 --> 04:04.360
- at least...
- Don't

04:04.520 --> 04:05.749
talk to me about my parents.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.151
I know exactly how
I'm going to honor them.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.073
I just need to
get close to him,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.040
and not get arrested the moment
I set foot up there.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.794
If you're thinking
about revenge,

04:14.960 --> 04:17.190
which you obviously are,
don't.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.315
At least look into
what I'm saying first,

04:20.680 --> 04:22.592
and if I'm wrong,
hey, man, have at it.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.114
Get your revenge on.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.390
But if I'm right,

04:26.040 --> 04:27.394
work with me.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.520
When we're done putting
the foot to alien ass,

04:29.600 --> 04:32.240
I will help you murk
this son of a bitch myself.

04:32.680 --> 04:33.680
Deal?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.800
You know, you really
stand out, wearing this.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.071
Go find Kem at the tavern.
Tell him I sent you.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.256
He'll, uh, hook you up
with a change of clothes.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.276
Seriously?

04:51.080 --> 04:52.196
Hello, Seg.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.840
We've been looking for you.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah, what's new?

05:22.920 --> 05:24.639
Rankless amateur.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.840
Oh!

05:29.640 --> 05:31.597
Come on. March!

05:42.880 --> 05:44.439
I hope you didn't break him.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.518
No, just a little love-tap.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.956
He'll be all right.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.160
He better be.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.440
You can leave now.

06:02.840 --> 06:03.840
What's going on?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.991
My father is waiting
for you,

06:08.360 --> 06:09.760
along with His Reverence.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.389
I suggest you clean yourself up
and get changed.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.920
You really don't want to
keep them waiting much longer.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.116
Trust me.

06:21.280 --> 06:21.952
You bear the sigil

06:22.120 --> 06:23.554
of House Vex from now on.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.317
We have been expecting you...

06:47.480 --> 06:49.199
For some time.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.360
Apologies, Father.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.073
Entirely my fault.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.833
Now, Seg.

07:01.960 --> 07:02.960
Oh.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.193
You are interested
in the mask?

07:05.640 --> 07:07.279
Course, it would be
the first time

07:07.440 --> 07:09.591
you've seen the many faces
up close.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.795
A face to symbolize
each of our old gods.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.599
Cythonna,

07:18.760 --> 07:20.479
Telle,

07:20.640 --> 07:22.233
Lorra,

07:22.400 --> 07:24.119
Mordo,

07:24.600 --> 07:25.636
Yuda,

07:27.680 --> 07:29.433
and finally, the one true god,

07:29.600 --> 07:32.718
our supreme deity, Rao.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.431
He who kindled the sun.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.549
We used to worship
all of the gods,

07:40.280 --> 07:43.000
but now, only one.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.760
Do you know why?

07:47.920 --> 07:49.354
At the time of creation,

07:50.480 --> 07:52.358
Rao looked out at the chaos

07:52.520 --> 07:54.432
and saw wasted potential,

07:54.720 --> 07:57.554
and so he formed
the stars and planets,

07:58.680 --> 08:02.310
the most perfect of which
became Krypton.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.270
You see,

08:07.520 --> 08:09.557
our very planet
is a symbol of

08:09.720 --> 08:11.916
fully realized potential, Seg.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.877
It is also harsh
and inhospitable.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.156
The only thing protecting us
is the force dome,

08:20.320 --> 08:23.119
and the only thing
protecting the dome is...

08:25.680 --> 08:26.875
Order.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.477
Sadly, your parents
chose chaos.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.440
I need to know if you intend

08:35.600 --> 08:37.159
to follow in their footsteps.

08:40.080 --> 08:40.751
I don't.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.715
The Investiture Ceremony
will be held tomorrow night,

08:48.280 --> 08:50.875
and then you officially
become a Vex.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.200
Don't be late.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.960
You are dismissed.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.158
Come on, guys.

09:09.360 --> 09:09.713
Line up.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.631
Come and get your brand-new,

09:10.800 --> 09:11.950
state-of-the-art firepower.

09:12.920 --> 09:13.920
All new blasters.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.360
Blow your whole
chest cavity out.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.873
Feel the weight of it,
much lighter

09:18.040 --> 09:19.040
and much quicker.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.955
You look after that.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
Commander?

09:23.760 --> 09:24.876
What is all this?

09:25.520 --> 09:26.317
Mommy didn't tell you?

09:27.520 --> 09:28.636
New offensive.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.440
We're going down to
the Rankless

09:30.520 --> 09:31.749
to smoke out Black Zero.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.512
This looks like
we're going to war.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.160
Well, shit yeah,
we're going to war.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.198
The Rankless are not
our enemy.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.360
Black Zero is.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.156
Well, who can be bothered

09:42.320 --> 09:43.959
sorting out
your actual terrorists

09:44.120 --> 09:45.952
from your regular, everyday,

09:46.120 --> 09:47.873
Rankless shitheads?

09:49.480 --> 09:51.073
All right, boys.
Who's ready to crack

09:51.240 --> 09:52.833
some Rankless skulls?

09:57.240 --> 09:58.469
Quex is right.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.196
You know the El name
was already synonymous

10:01.360 --> 10:03.192
with resistance
amongst the Rankless.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.431
Val-El's execution
made sure of it.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.552
Now with Ter and Charys,

10:07.720 --> 10:09.916
Black Zero have new martyrs
for their rallying cry.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.275
They weren't terrorists.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.635
They confessed to it,

10:13.240 --> 10:14.435
and I bet my life

10:14.600 --> 10:15.795
their son is, too,

10:15.960 --> 10:16.960
and now he gets to

10:17.080 --> 10:18.719
walk amongst us
up here in the guilds.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.880
It's not right.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.480
You know what Quex is like.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.637
If he leads this thing,
it will be a bloodbath.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.800
Innocent lives will be...

10:24.880 --> 10:25.711
You know, I never really

10:25.880 --> 10:27.473
cared about the scars.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.156
Sometimes, I even forget
I still have them.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.760
- Dev...
- Or the ache in my shoulder

10:31.880 --> 10:35.032
that wakes me up
every single day.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.554
I can live with that too.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.395
What I can't live with

10:38.560 --> 10:40.233
is knowing
the people responsible

10:40.400 --> 10:41.436
were never found.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.840
They get to live free
somewhere,

10:42.960 --> 10:44.360
while my family...

10:47.640 --> 10:48.790
Maybe...

10:49.000 --> 10:51.356
not all Rankless
are Black Zero,

10:52.160 --> 10:54.720
but they provide cover
for them,

10:54.920 --> 10:56.400
so please don't
talk to me again

10:56.560 --> 10:58.119
about innocent lives.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.316
Primus Zod, a word, please.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.480
Quickly.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.194
This new offensive.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.896
The Rankless Initiative.
What about it?

11:15.920 --> 11:18.276
It's only going to breed
more resentment.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.480
Our people are divided enough
without this.

11:21.800 --> 11:25.476
Black Zero almost
assassinated the Voice of Rao.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.315
Until he was saved
by a Rankless.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.475
I can't see them putting
their lives on the line for him

11:31.640 --> 11:34.314
after we destroy what little
they have down there,

11:35.080 --> 11:37.549
or after you've gunned down
two of their own

11:37.720 --> 11:39.040
in the Tribunal.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.590
I executed two
self-confessed terrorists

11:41.800 --> 11:44.315
who pulled weapons
on the chief magistrate,

11:44.480 --> 11:46.153
as is my duty.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.713
You had best be very careful

11:49.880 --> 11:52.349
of what comes out of
your mouth next, Lyta.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.880
Or perhaps you'd care
to explain

11:54.040 --> 11:55.560
what compels you
to defend the Rankless

11:55.680 --> 11:57.194
at every chance you get?

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
I just...

11:58.920 --> 12:01.116
I have to believe
there's another way.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.913
You have neither the right

12:04.080 --> 12:06.549
nor the rank to question this.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.920
And given your recent
training performances,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.310
your focus should be
on staying alive.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.675
Nothing more,

12:13.280 --> 12:14.509
nothing less.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.279
Is that clear enough for you?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.240
Loud and clear, Primus.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.514
I got your message.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.030
You okay?

12:53.360 --> 12:55.033
What happened to
my parents...

12:56.400 --> 12:58.790
I know it had nothing
to do with you...

12:59.000 --> 13:00.275
really, I do...

13:01.080 --> 13:02.514
but at the same time,
I can't forget

13:02.680 --> 13:04.194
what your mother did.

13:08.680 --> 13:09.955
I understand.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.918
I just don't know
what I'm meant to do now.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.392
There are so many things
in our lives we can't control.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.880
Only you know

13:20.040 --> 13:21.440
what's inside you,

13:22.400 --> 13:23.914
what you're capable of.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.792
You just need to
be true to yourself.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.480
We both do.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.160
Seg?

13:47.240 --> 13:48.515
You look troubled.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.673
Is something on your mind?

13:53.120 --> 13:55.635
I wanted to ask you
about my parents.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.474
I'd like to perform
traditional funeral rights.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.278
It's out of the question,
I'm afraid.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.709
Your parents died as

14:04.520 --> 14:05.954
enemies of the state.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.800
I'm sorry, Seg.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.551
I lost my parents when I was,
uh...

14:11.840 --> 14:13.752
a few years younger
than you are now.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.192
I thought I'd never recover,

14:16.720 --> 14:17.720
but I did,

14:18.320 --> 14:19.549
and you will too.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.514
You remind me of him, you know.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.429
Your grandfather, that is.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.031
You're going to be
a Vex soon.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.394
Maybe it's time we talked about

14:32.600 --> 14:34.159
the history between
our two houses.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.637
Maybe I can help you understand

14:38.800 --> 14:41.315
what happened
all those years ago.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.160
With your grandfather.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.039
What people fail to realize is

14:47.520 --> 14:49.000
how much I admired Val.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.719
We were so close,
once.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.119
But what Val was doing...

14:59.640 --> 15:01.313
It threatened
our whole way of life.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.960
He developed a highly advanced
computer system,

15:09.120 --> 15:12.272
but of course, he refused
to reveal its location.

15:14.720 --> 15:17.155
Through this technology,
he claimed to have

15:17.320 --> 15:19.630
detected a... presence,

15:19.800 --> 15:22.713
many millions of light-years
away.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.760
He said it was
collecting worlds, and...

15:27.840 --> 15:31.072
eventually, it would come
for Krypton.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.830
And you didn't believe him?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.559
Of course not.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.598
You see, Seg...

15:41.800 --> 15:44.759
Even great men
can lose their way,

15:45.320 --> 15:46.879
and that's the tragedy here.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.190
If not for this obsession,

15:48.360 --> 15:49.416
Val could have gone on
to achieve

15:49.440 --> 15:50.840
so much more for our people.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.195
His legacy could've

15:52.440 --> 15:53.715
lived on forever.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.190
He could've been immortalized.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.757
Maybe his legacy can live on.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.720
If you admired him
as much as you say, then...

16:05.000 --> 16:06.275
Let me continue his work

16:06.760 --> 16:08.035
His earlier work,

16:08.480 --> 16:09.675
with the Science Guild.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.395
Let me serve Kandor
the way he did.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.433
Wow, you look...

16:22.480 --> 16:24.153
You look.
Are you sure

16:24.320 --> 16:26.277
Seg is gonna pay for those?

16:26.440 --> 16:27.920
Absolutely.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.355
And you know, I'm offended.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.436
He was very clear.
Change of clothes,

16:32.800 --> 16:33.800
no expense spared.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.149
Oh, clearly.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.149
And, uh,

16:37.320 --> 16:39.789
he also said something
to quench my thirst.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.194
Extremely clear
about that one.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.760
Did he?
Okay.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.274
Well, enjoy.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.719
Well, this looks
positively intriguing,

16:53.880 --> 16:55.712
and I am dying to hear
all about it,

16:55.880 --> 16:56.880
but can we just have a...

16:57.040 --> 16:58.679
a little word in private first?

17:00.560 --> 17:01.630
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.280
- Yeah.
- It's not about you.

17:03.840 --> 17:04.955
Just...

17:05.560 --> 17:06.310
Okay.

17:08.280 --> 17:11.717
What in the name of Rao
is going on?

17:11.920 --> 17:13.593
Firstly, you disappear
without a trace,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.096
and then you show up,
looking like this,

17:15.119 --> 17:15.951
then this guy shows up,

17:16.119 --> 17:16.871
says that you sent him,

17:17.040 --> 17:18.792
and starts telling
crazy stories about...

17:18.960 --> 17:20.758
I know, I know, I know,
they...

17:21.079 --> 17:22.719
- They sound crazy.
- Yeah.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.315
They might...

17:24.520 --> 17:26.193
actually be true.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.074
Seg, listen.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.696
I know you've been going
through a lot lately.

17:31.720 --> 17:32.836
I'm fine.

17:33.920 --> 17:34.671
Trust me.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.199
Okay, okay.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.191
You know, I like Candy Crush
as much as the next guy,

17:41.360 --> 17:42.111
- but this is...
- Shut up and listen,

17:42.280 --> 17:43.350
Earth man.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.752
I took your advice earlier,

17:46.960 --> 17:48.536
so now I'm a member
of the Science Guild.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.914
They gave me that

17:50.080 --> 17:52.037
and unlimited access
to their data banks.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.839
Ah, see, I told you
that that was...

17:54.000 --> 17:55.275
I'm not finished.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.600
You said you could find proof

17:56.800 --> 17:57.800
to back up your claims

17:57.840 --> 17:58.840
about Brainiac.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.070
Here's your chance.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.560
But I'm not going to let you
string me along forever.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.195
You have two hours.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.832
If you don't come up with
anything by then,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.037
I'm going to finish
what I went up there to do.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.440
Commander,

18:26.520 --> 18:27.520
do you have a moment?

18:29.960 --> 18:32.429
I've already been informed
of your complaints.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.193
Concerns, not complaints.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.317
You should've come to me
first.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.355
You made me look like a punk.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.797
You don't need my help
with that.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.480
What did you just say?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.713
Commander Quex-UI.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.633
I, Lyta-Zod,

18:47.800 --> 18:50.110
hereby invoke
the spirit of Jo-Mon,

18:50.280 --> 18:51.396
and our ancient traditions,

18:51.560 --> 18:54.553
in challenging you
to a Kandorian duel.

18:54.720 --> 18:55.760
- Lyta...
- You silly girl.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.200
Of which the victor

18:57.400 --> 18:59.835
will assume command
of this division

19:00.000 --> 19:02.310
and the right for their voice
to be heard

19:02.480 --> 19:03.709
above all others.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
Lyta, please.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.079
Don't do this.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.280
If you go through with it,
there's nothing I can do.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.033
Quex is bound by
Kandorian rite

19:13.200 --> 19:15.556
to show no mercy.
That means to the death.

19:15.720 --> 19:16.840
You think I don't know that?

19:16.960 --> 19:18.599
Then please explain this
to me.

19:18.800 --> 19:19.597
Tell me why.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.995
Sagitari Zod,

19:21.720 --> 19:22.720
inside.

19:23.200 --> 19:23.951
Now.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.352
What is the meaning of this?

19:37.840 --> 19:39.069
I challenged my commander

19:39.280 --> 19:40.680
for the right to lead
our division.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.430
I am not required
to give a reason.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.158
I'm asking for one.

19:46.680 --> 19:47.955
As my superior?

19:48.560 --> 19:49.596
As your mother.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.471
A mother who doesn't
believe her child

19:53.640 --> 19:55.074
is capable of being a warrior.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.879
- Not yet.
- Not ever.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.352
I see it in your eyes, Mother.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.193
I always have.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.158
You try to hide it,
but you don't think

20:03.320 --> 20:05.710
I will ever be worthy
of the Zod name.

20:05.880 --> 20:06.880
That's not true.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.040
It is.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.632
And it's fine.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.320
But it's not going to stop me.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.909
You and I both know

20:16.080 --> 20:18.117
there's no turning back
from this.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.154
May Rao's grace be your shield.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.438
Nothing on
the satellite array.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.156
Nothing on
the deep space sensors.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.616
It's not just Kandor City,
either.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.313
This is connected to

20:49.480 --> 20:50.914
the Guild's
planet-wide network.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.320
There's nothing out there.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.078
No, that can't be right.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.560
It's a mistake.
Check that again.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.550
Seg...

21:04.720 --> 21:06.000
- Well, that's it, then.
- Seg...

21:06.080 --> 21:07.080
Seg, hey, come on

21:07.280 --> 21:08.794
Hey, hey, hey, wait!

21:09.440 --> 21:10.476
Just wait.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.120
Give us a second.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.791
Seg, please think about
what you are doing.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.430
Okay?
Forget this idiot.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.875
Let's just you and I

21:25.040 --> 21:26.269
sit down and talk it over.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.909
All I've done
is think about this,

21:29.080 --> 21:30.434
and I'm done talking.

21:30.640 --> 21:31.676
If you do this,

21:31.840 --> 21:33.991
you are throwing away
everything.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.671
There's nothing left
to throw away.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.960
You look me in the eye

21:46.120 --> 21:47.918
and you tell me

21:48.080 --> 21:49.639
that what you've been saying
is true.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.072
I swear to God.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.496
Well, then, we'd better
find another way to prove it,

21:56.520 --> 21:59.240
or else our boy
is gonna get himself killed.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.360
You're a quick learner.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.240
You've hardly been up here,

22:37.400 --> 22:39.551
and you already
look sure of yourself.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.560
About my father,

22:45.680 --> 22:47.000
he's...

22:47.160 --> 22:48.913
always had a flair
for the dramatic, but...

22:50.520 --> 22:51.520
You said your father

22:51.640 --> 22:52.760
only thinks that
he chose me.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.440
If this really was your choice,

22:55.600 --> 22:57.000
then maybe you can tell me why.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.632
First, I want
to show you something.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.550
It's my parents ashes.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.433
But you could be arrested
for this.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.716
I know.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.160
Then why?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.475
Everyone deserves a chance

23:27.640 --> 23:29.233
to say good-bye
to the ones they love.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.997
No matter the circumstances.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.190
Nyssa.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.875
Thank you.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.311
Climatology reports,
atmospheric physics,

24:52.480 --> 24:54.597
- meteorological phenomena...
- Bam! That's it!

24:55.240 --> 24:56.240
Check for anomalies.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.509
Uh, anomalies.
Okay.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.359
Um... Hm.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.896
Well, here's something
you don't see every day.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.196
The meteor shower reported
in the Outlands.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.360
Is it recent?

25:05.440 --> 25:06.840
Yeah, three days ago.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.000
Okay, we gotta
check that out.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.394
Well, okay, but, I mean,

25:11.440 --> 25:13.272
I guess we can tag along
with a salvage crew,

25:13.440 --> 25:14.536
but it's illegal,

25:14.560 --> 25:15.880
so we're gonna
have to bribe them.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.513
Great.
Let's go.

25:18.920 --> 25:19.920
What?

25:19.960 --> 25:21.076
Hm?

25:21.240 --> 25:22.496
Why are you looking at me
like that?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.113
Well, I'm not exactly flush,

25:24.280 --> 25:26.351
but there might be
another way.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.917
It may just cost you
that head cover.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.520
My...

25:44.920 --> 25:46.354
No more hiding.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.309
- What?
- All your life,

25:48.520 --> 25:49.670
you've hidden your truth,

25:49.840 --> 25:51.559
like it's something
to be ashamed of.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.714
I've always seen it,

25:54.200 --> 25:56.351
when nobody else has,
even your mother.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.032
You are not Sagitari.

26:03.680 --> 26:06.479
You are Lyta of House Zod.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.960
You are a warrior...

26:09.360 --> 26:10.635
And you always have been.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.711
Rhom, Ona.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.197
I'm...

26:41.360 --> 26:43.192
I'm sorry.
I... I, um...

26:43.320 --> 26:45.880
- I wasn't expecting you.
- We just wanted to stop by

26:46.080 --> 26:47.116
and pay our respects.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.196
Your mom and dad...

26:50.360 --> 26:53.194
They were always willing
to look after Ona

26:53.360 --> 26:54.840
when I worked nights.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.631
Never asked for
anything in return.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.675
I hope you know
how much they meant to us.

27:15.480 --> 27:16.630
Thank you.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.590
Thank you both.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.158
A thousand cycles ago,

27:28.320 --> 27:30.232
the ancient warrior Jo-Mon

27:30.400 --> 27:31.595
faced a challenge

27:31.760 --> 27:34.514
that would
change Krypton forever.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.239
Jo-Mon invited his detractors

27:38.360 --> 27:39.589
to the highest peak

27:39.800 --> 27:42.031
of the Jewel Mountains

27:42.440 --> 27:44.033
and challenged them,

27:44.200 --> 27:45.714
one by one,

27:45.880 --> 27:48.031
to a duel to the death.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.275
His victory

27:50.480 --> 27:51.480
ushered in

27:51.800 --> 27:54.235
the first golden age
of peace

27:54.440 --> 27:56.159
in Krypton's history.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.355
If one believes

27:58.520 --> 28:01.240
they are worthy
of true leadership,

28:01.400 --> 28:03.915
it is not only their right,

28:04.080 --> 28:06.914
but their obligation
to act on it.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.319
Fight with honor.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.599
Fight with pride,

28:16.520 --> 28:19.877
and fight without mercy.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.071
Begin.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.279
"The blood of House El
will forever bind us."

29:51.400 --> 29:52.754
The blood of House El.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.669
Hello, Seg.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.234
Grandpa, you...

31:00.680 --> 31:01.680
You're not...

31:01.720 --> 31:02.790
I'm afraid not, Seg.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.869
I'm a projection.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.994
A copy of Val-El.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.111
I share his thoughts
and memories, but...

31:11.840 --> 31:13.069
in essence,

31:13.920 --> 31:15.798
I'm a computer program.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.354
You knew
they were coming for you.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.274
I suspected it.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.192
But I knew I had
a responsibility to you, Seg.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.153
That's why I created
this program.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.155
To guide you.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.234
To educate you

31:30.680 --> 31:32.273
when the time came.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.716
Well, there's a chance
that time has arrived.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.640
Well, then, we better
get started.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.393
Seems to love
that arm clock.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.677
Oh, yeah, he really loves it.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.872
Ooh, yeah, he's...
he's tough.

31:52.520 --> 31:53.874
Used to wrestle.

31:54.760 --> 31:57.434
But, um, there it is.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.080
We're good, yeah?

32:01.120 --> 32:01.837
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Mm.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.199
- I... I told you.
- Come...

32:06.400 --> 32:07.516
I told you.

32:07.680 --> 32:08.976
You said we had to get
to the Outlands.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.150
This is the price we pay.

32:11.960 --> 32:12.960
Good deal.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.836
It's weird, anyway.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.559
It's like your forehead's
got a beak.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.279
Just...

32:22.200 --> 32:23.919
Oh. Oh.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.799
Mwa! Beautiful!

32:28.400 --> 32:29.550
This way.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.431
We're in.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.275
He's not even a fan.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.598
And Tharb-El,

32:39.760 --> 32:41.672
also a member of
the Science Guild,

32:41.840 --> 32:43.752
discovered a cure
for the Green Death,

32:43.920 --> 32:46.230
which almost drove our planet
to extinction.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.199
Seg, it would take millennia

32:49.400 --> 32:51.471
for me to detail
the achievements of our house.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.236
The important thing
to remember is

32:54.920 --> 32:56.354
their greatness

32:56.520 --> 32:58.352
lives on in you.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.555
The blood of House El.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.197
You are the torchbearer
for our legacy now.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.431
You must keep that flame alive,

33:07.600 --> 33:09.717
pass it on
to the next generation.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.393
If you believe in yourself,

33:12.560 --> 33:14.119
the way I always have,

33:14.280 --> 33:15.880
your accomplishments
will stand alongside

33:16.000 --> 33:18.037
all those who came before you,

33:18.840 --> 33:21.753
and will forever inspire
those that follow.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.554
Then tell me about Brainiac.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.117
Help me find a way to stop him.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.873
Well, there's not much
to tell.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.918
Once the Council moved to
silence me,

33:32.040 --> 33:34.157
I continued my work here,

33:34.360 --> 33:38.274
where I created
the most incredible technology

33:38.640 --> 33:40.279
that allowed me to enter

33:40.440 --> 33:42.079
the interdimensional realm

33:42.560 --> 33:43.630
which lay beyond

33:43.800 --> 33:46.156
the normal space-time
continuum.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.399
I called it the "Phantom Zone."

33:50.520 --> 33:51.520
You have a better name?

33:51.560 --> 33:53.040
Eh...

33:53.200 --> 33:54.270
No, no, it's a cool name.

33:54.440 --> 33:55.920
It's a cool name.
It's catchy.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.800
It was only a prototype,
and I knew it was dangerous.

33:58.960 --> 34:01.475
I used it to travel
throughout space,

34:01.640 --> 34:03.438
where I found entire galaxies,

34:03.640 --> 34:05.791
swarming with intelligent life,

34:06.360 --> 34:08.476
all under threat...

34:09.040 --> 34:10.599
by a barbarous creature

34:11.400 --> 34:12.550
moving unchecked

34:12.719 --> 34:14.632
throughout the universe,

34:15.000 --> 34:16.159
devouring these civilizations

34:16.360 --> 34:18.112
one by one.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.594
I hurried back,

34:19.920 --> 34:21.639
somehow made it out
of the Phantom Zone,

34:21.800 --> 34:24.190
tried to warn the Council.

34:24.560 --> 34:25.789
Then...

34:26.159 --> 34:28.594
Well, you know how that ended.

34:29.679 --> 34:31.592
It's not over yet, Grandpa.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.232
We're gonna finish
what you started.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.516
I promise.

34:35.679 --> 34:37.159
I like the sound of that.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.635
But you better do something

34:40.800 --> 34:42.438
about this house of Vex
situation first.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.155
Mercy!

35:48.400 --> 35:52.314
We never ask for mercy.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.755
Well, Seg,
this is impressive.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.315
You're early.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.037
Investiture Ceremony isn't
for another hour.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.120
There's not gonna be
a ceremony.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.550
I'm sorry?

36:54.720 --> 36:55.995
You want me
to be Ranked again?

36:56.160 --> 36:57.833
Join the Science Guild,

36:58.000 --> 36:59.912
Bind with your daughter,

37:00.800 --> 37:01.800
okay.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.959
But even if I never get to bear

37:04.120 --> 37:06.032
the sigil of my own house,

37:06.640 --> 37:08.711
I will not wear yours.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.918
I'd rather die Rankless.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.312
Now, you listen to me.

37:24.480 --> 37:25.520
And you listen well, th...

37:35.720 --> 37:38.315
This is acceptable.

37:38.800 --> 37:42.430
You will wear the sigil
of the Science Guild.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.280
Why, Your Eminence...

37:44.320 --> 37:46.312
Leave us now, Seg.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.832
May Rao's light

37:48.960 --> 37:51.839
forever guide your way.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.235
You too.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.670
Please.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.395
Help me understand.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.637
You want to control him.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.431
This is how.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.596
We've been at this
for hours!

38:46.120 --> 38:46.951
What?

38:47.120 --> 38:47.951
I'm sorry, but I think

38:48.120 --> 38:49.554
we need to call it!

38:57.080 --> 39:00.551
You know what the first rule
of archaeology is?

39:00.720 --> 39:01.995
I have no idea!

39:02.160 --> 39:03.879
Yeah, neither do I.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.759
I dropped out
the first year of college,

39:05.920 --> 39:09.880
but I think it's something
like "never stop searching."

39:10.040 --> 39:11.713
That's a wonderful story,

39:12.040 --> 39:13.235
but we need to go,

39:13.400 --> 39:15.073
or else we're gonna die!

39:15.920 --> 39:17.070
Hold on.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.113
I found something!

39:21.960 --> 39:24.714
Oh, yeah,
we call those rocks.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.239
It's not just any rock.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.913
See the markings?

39:40.800 --> 39:41.916
Yeah.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.673
Scorch marks

39:43.840 --> 39:45.240
from something crashing here.

39:45.840 --> 39:46.876
Over there.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.077
The sigil on the urn
was a nice touch.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.316
Not that it mattered.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.474
I'm voicing
my displeasure here,

40:22.640 --> 40:23.710
in case you couldn't tell.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.394
What do you want me to say?

40:25.560 --> 40:28.439
Evidently, he didn't
get the closure we expected.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.559
You expected.

40:31.560 --> 40:32.914
It was your suggestion.

40:35.880 --> 40:37.519
And now I have another one.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.356
Be patient.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.559
He trusts me now.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.200
That alone
made this worthwhile.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.478
I hope it was worth it.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.115
I tried talking to you.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.192
I don't know why
you're protecting Seg,

41:06.640 --> 41:08.438
but if you want to
risk your life for him,

41:08.600 --> 41:09.875
so be it.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.520
But not even Rao will help you

41:11.680 --> 41:13.273
if you risk those
of your squads.

41:19.360 --> 41:20.760
Lyta-Zod,

41:21.560 --> 41:23.074
I hereby appoint you

41:23.240 --> 41:25.914
Commander of Fourth Squad,
Sagitari.

41:26.080 --> 41:29.391
You are obliged to bear
true allegiance and faith

41:29.560 --> 41:31.119
to the Military Guild
of Kandor City

41:31.280 --> 41:33.033
against all enemies

41:33.200 --> 41:36.750
and to defend and support
the Supreme Council,

41:36.920 --> 41:39.355
in loyal service of
His Reverence,

41:39.520 --> 41:41.239
the Voice of Rao.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.872
May Rao's grace

41:44.240 --> 41:45.594
be your shield.

41:51.720 --> 41:53.871
It only gets harder from here.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.911
Dismissed, Commander.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.176
This better be
something real, Earth man.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.395
I'm getting tired of being...

42:12.360 --> 42:13.360
What is that?

42:15.640 --> 42:17.438
Not sure what you call it.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.473
Brainiac sends them out
to any planet

42:20.680 --> 42:22.637
that he deems
worthy of conquest

42:22.800 --> 42:24.154
as a forward scout.

42:26.480 --> 42:28.039
Brainiac isn't on his way.

42:29.560 --> 42:30.994
He's already here.
