WEBVTT

00:17.708 --> 00:19.083
Babies need fathers.

00:19.417 --> 00:21.208
What about moms?
Aren't moms important?

00:21.583 --> 00:22.834
Yeah... for six months.

00:24.083 --> 00:26.583
ADAM: I made a movie
about what we went through.

00:26.583 --> 00:28.917
-It can help you move on.
-I have moved on.

00:28.917 --> 00:30.583
RAY: Maybe it is time
to make some changes.

00:30.583 --> 00:31.875
Maybe it is time
to do something

00:31.875 --> 00:33.959
people will... remember.

00:34.291 --> 00:36.000
JESSA: You are still
my dear friend.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.250
I don't think we ever acted
like real friends.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.708
Everything that we did
together happened!

00:40.959 --> 00:43.667
-You can't just erase me.
-I don't care anymore.

00:44.041 --> 00:46.500
You know, I'm just kinda doing
my normal ethical duty,

00:46.500 --> 00:48.041
and letting you know
that I'm pregnant.

00:48.041 --> 00:50.500
Well, thanks for telling me...
I guess.

00:50.792 --> 00:54.625
-Sounds like he dismissed you.
-No, it went perfectly.

01:03.291 --> 01:06.125
Adam:
This isn't something
I want to have to tell you.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.875
I know you're gonna be
pissed as fuck

01:07.875 --> 01:10.667
and you should
be pissed.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.917
I don't want to be
saying all this, Jessa,
but, fuck,

01:12.917 --> 01:14.667
I have to explore it.

01:14.667 --> 01:17.083
And I can't help it
if you're angry,

01:17.083 --> 01:20.917
because the fact is,
my higher power,
or whatever,

01:20.917 --> 01:23.041
is-- is pushing me
to look.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.208
And I'm not sure
what Hannah's gonna
even say,

01:26.208 --> 01:27.542
but I know
what I'm gonna say.

01:27.542 --> 01:29.166
I'm just gonna say,
"Look, Hannah,

01:29.166 --> 01:31.625
we have a lot of history
that we can't seem to erase.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.083
We can't let each other go,
as much as we try,

01:34.083 --> 01:36.667
so let me raise
this baby with you."

01:39.458 --> 01:41.208
Um...

01:42.500 --> 01:45.041
Yeah. Yeah.

01:45.041 --> 01:47.000
I don't know
what she'll say either.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.208
Is there anything
you want to say to me?

01:50.208 --> 01:51.583
Uh...

01:51.583 --> 01:53.333
Look.

01:53.333 --> 01:56.166
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

01:56.166 --> 01:58.333
- I'm not a zookeeper.
- Come the fuck on.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.458
There's something else
in there.

01:59.458 --> 02:01.208
Will you just say it?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.708
Spit in my face,
punch me.

02:02.708 --> 02:03.834
What? Just do it.

02:03.834 --> 02:06.208
Why would I do that?

02:06.208 --> 02:07.959
You haven't done
anything wrong.

02:07.959 --> 02:09.083
( laughing )

02:14.750 --> 02:17.708
( music playing )

02:29.125 --> 02:30.917
Elijah!

02:32.041 --> 02:33.041
Elijah!

02:33.041 --> 02:34.500
Look, lady!

02:34.500 --> 02:37.458
( sighs )
I am very frustrated,
too, okay?

02:37.458 --> 02:40.208
But I can't get the dial
on that air conditioner
to move an inch,

02:40.208 --> 02:42.458
and I tried using
an actual screwdriver.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.333
( groans )

02:44.333 --> 02:46.417
I gotta ask,
why did you wait
until you were pregnant

02:46.417 --> 02:48.583
to start wearing
halfway decent underwear?

02:48.583 --> 02:50.291
I don't feel so good.

02:50.291 --> 02:52.875
Well, honey, of course
you don't feel good.

02:52.875 --> 02:56.583
It's 127 degrees in here
and we are poor.

02:56.583 --> 02:59.291
You've got a parasite
growing inside of you.

02:59.291 --> 03:01.917
Probably both gonna die
of heat stroke at any minute.

03:01.917 --> 03:04.583
Oh, God,
we're gonna die
like those...

03:04.583 --> 03:07.750
old people in Queens
on New York 1.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.542
I'm too pretty to go
to a cooling station.

03:10.542 --> 03:13.625
I don't know, it's just that
conversation with Paul-Louis,
it really fucked me up.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.583
I've been thinking
about it so much.

03:15.583 --> 03:18.000
( laughing )

03:18.000 --> 03:20.291
What is funny about that?

03:20.291 --> 03:22.417
His name.
"Paul-Louis."

03:22.417 --> 03:23.917
You know, I just have
to wonder, like,

03:23.917 --> 03:25.708
am I denying my child
this, like,

03:25.708 --> 03:27.917
essential part
of their identity,
half of who they are?

03:27.917 --> 03:30.959
Imagine who I would be
had I never met my father.

03:30.959 --> 03:32.792
Well, you probably
wouldn't have known

03:32.792 --> 03:34.500
all the lyrics
to "Funny Girl"
by the time you were four.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.250
I'm starting to feel like
I was a little naive,

03:36.250 --> 03:39.125
thinking this was all
gonna be so simple.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.000
Oh, God.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.250
Hannah, this is gonna be
a real mindfuck for me

03:45.250 --> 03:47.125
if you wanna get
an abortion right now.

03:47.125 --> 03:49.125
- What?
- I mean...

03:49.125 --> 03:50.708
I'll do it.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.792
I think there's about
two doctors in America

03:52.792 --> 03:55.542
that will do it at this
stage in your pregnancy,
but I'll find them.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.291
I'm not getting
an abortion, Elijah,

03:57.291 --> 03:59.542
I'm having feelings.
It's different.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.458
Jesus Christ.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.875
Speaking of different...

04:03.875 --> 04:05.792
Those nipples...

04:21.375 --> 04:24.417
- ( door chimes )
- ( music playing over PA )

04:24.417 --> 04:25.500
Hey.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.834
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.917
That's a whole lot of pops.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.667
Yeah, I mean,
they're for, like,
the next three days.

04:35.667 --> 04:38.458
I won't have to keep
going back and forth
and getting pops.

04:38.458 --> 04:39.667
What are you doing
on my block?

04:39.667 --> 04:42.083
Well, I'm looking
for you, actually.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.667
Well, congratulations,
you have located me, so.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.917
Could we go outside
and talk?

04:47.917 --> 04:50.000
No, actually,
'cause anything
you have to say to me,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.583
I'm perfectly comfortable
with my friend, Amir,
hearing.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.750
He is my close friend.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.458
Okay, fine.

04:57.458 --> 04:58.917
Um...

04:58.917 --> 05:00.708
And also,
if you're looking
for permission

05:00.708 --> 05:02.875
to make a sequel
to your movie that
depicts me as, like,

05:02.875 --> 05:04.291
Brooklyn's own
Zelda Fitzgerald,

05:04.291 --> 05:06.041
minus the talent
and the cool, funky hair,

05:06.041 --> 05:07.917
then I'm not gonna
co-sign on that.

05:07.917 --> 05:10.125
Why don't you try
casting someone who
vaguely resembles me

05:10.125 --> 05:12.375
and has my gravitas
next time, okay?

05:12.375 --> 05:15.208
And just let me know
when it's safe for me
to leave my house again.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.542
Hannah...

05:17.542 --> 05:19.583
I wanna raise
your child with you.

05:21.917 --> 05:24.750
I miss you,
and I miss being with you.

05:24.750 --> 05:27.166
And I thought I could move on,
but hearing about the baby

05:27.166 --> 05:30.500
made me realize we don't
have any more time to waste.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.083
Let me show you
who I've become.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.083
I wanna be there for you
as you become a mother,

05:34.083 --> 05:36.708
I wanna watch you blossom
and love this baby

05:36.708 --> 05:39.250
more than anyone has
ever loved a living thing.

05:40.542 --> 05:42.750
I don't wanna be
away from you any longer.

05:45.959 --> 05:48.250
I'm so confused.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.959
Can we go to your house?
( laughs )

06:00.208 --> 06:02.166
No, let's try this again.

06:02.166 --> 06:05.375
I said that I want
the elite channels.

06:05.375 --> 06:08.083
Whatever those are.
I don't know what they are.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.667
Animal Planet.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.750
And Court TV.
I don't know!

06:11.750 --> 06:15.917
I just want
to buy the full package
of elite channels

06:15.917 --> 06:18.166
so that I can enjoy
a range of programs.

06:18.166 --> 06:20.125
Do you understand?

06:21.792 --> 06:23.708
Can you hold on a second?

06:23.708 --> 06:25.000
Just...

06:32.375 --> 06:35.125
( vomiting, coughing )

06:38.041 --> 06:40.166
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Are you okay?

06:40.166 --> 06:42.000
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.667
I kind of feel like
we have audience.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.667
( both laughing )

06:54.333 --> 06:56.708
These 97 audio cassettes

06:56.708 --> 06:59.375
contain interviews
conducted by my friend
and mentor,

06:59.375 --> 07:00.667
Hermie Del Benseur,

07:00.667 --> 07:02.750
with Brooklyn's
elderly members.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.667
Now, if you were
to help us

07:04.667 --> 07:06.542
in digitizing
these tapes,

07:06.542 --> 07:09.041
you would help us create
an accessible platform

07:09.041 --> 07:10.959
where people can experience

07:10.959 --> 07:14.500
the horror of gentrification
in a very visceral way.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.375
I'll tell you what it is
that I know, Shosh.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.041
There is nothing worse
in this world

07:18.041 --> 07:19.792
than inheritance,
nothing.

07:19.792 --> 07:21.458
- That's why I need
to earn this.
- Well...

07:21.458 --> 07:22.750
You understand?
Genuinely earn it.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.500
Hermie gave me
everything that he did

07:24.500 --> 07:25.959
so I can keep
his dream alive.

07:25.959 --> 07:27.458
Okay,
I don't understand.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.333
Why don't you
just stick with
the coffee industry,

07:29.333 --> 07:31.000
and, like, you know,
relax a little?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.250
I don't know, just, like,
chill for a second.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.834
You don't "get it,"
do you?

07:34.834 --> 07:36.834
- You don't "get it"!
- Excuse me.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.500
Do not "air quote"
at me!

07:38.500 --> 07:40.750
I will "air quote
when I need to air quote
to stress a point."

07:40.750 --> 07:42.667
- "Okay, well,
don't do it"--
- Shoshanna!

07:42.667 --> 07:44.041
Shosh!

07:44.041 --> 07:45.625
Yeah!

07:45.625 --> 07:46.625
Baby!

07:46.625 --> 07:48.041
Get out of here!

07:48.041 --> 07:49.375
How are you?

07:49.375 --> 07:52.083
Hi! Okay, okay.
She's so sweet.

07:52.083 --> 07:54.417
She couldn't be nicer,
and you're gonna
totally love her,

07:54.417 --> 07:56.125
except for the times
that you absolutely
hate her

07:56.125 --> 07:58.417
because she just
never turns off.
She's a lot.

07:58.417 --> 08:00.125
- She's just like--
- ( laughing )
Hello!

08:00.125 --> 08:01.667
- Hi!
- Oh, my God!

08:01.667 --> 08:03.834
I've been looking for you
everywhere, dude.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.166
Like, not physically,
but I've definitely been

08:06.166 --> 08:07.959
dominating your inbox.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.500
- Yep.
- I miss you!

08:09.500 --> 08:10.917
Totally!
I, um...

08:10.917 --> 08:12.875
- This is Ray,
by the way.
- Hi.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.708
Hi. Hello.

08:14.708 --> 08:16.708
Okay, now,
you gotta tell me,

08:16.708 --> 08:19.333
what are y'all doing
on my block? Huh?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.458
You're not trying
to rob me, are you?

08:21.458 --> 08:22.708
( laughs )
I'm kidding.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.834
- I will cut your ass.
- ( laughs )

08:24.834 --> 08:26.959
Actually, just getting
some tapes digitized.

08:26.959 --> 08:28.708
- I'm working on a project--
- She doesn't--

08:28.708 --> 08:30.708
She doesn't need
to know about that.

08:30.708 --> 08:32.250
She was just asking
to be nice.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.750
- Oh.
- What?

08:33.750 --> 08:37.582
Hold on. This haunted-ass
building digitizes tapes?

08:37.582 --> 08:40.166
Ray, you've really
changed things for me.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.917
The other day I was watching
my "Popples" video,

08:41.917 --> 08:44.917
and, Ray, it was like
a haunting moment

08:44.917 --> 08:48.583
where I realized that
this tape was degrading
slowly.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.583
My favorite show growing up
was this obscure
Russian cartoon

08:51.583 --> 08:54.750
about a tiny cup of borscht
that had no father.

08:54.750 --> 08:57.583
The catchphrase was
"Papa would be so hungry."

08:57.583 --> 08:59.542
Shaped me as a child.

08:59.542 --> 09:01.125
That explains so much.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.625
Yeah, I can't remember
what it's called.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.417
Oh, my God.
We've gotta find it.

09:04.417 --> 09:07.625
So, now, who's gonna
buy me lunch?

09:07.625 --> 09:09.208
Mommy? Friends?

09:09.208 --> 09:11.125
Mommy's not here.
Mommy ran off.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.291
She left.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.458
She walked out,
never came home.

09:14.458 --> 09:17.166
Yeah, she doesn't like
being around me.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.417
Yeah, Mommy
can't stand Daddy.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.291
Where's your
elephant's toes?

09:21.291 --> 09:23.542
- Rawr!
- Oh! Hey, there.

09:23.542 --> 09:26.708
That's--
that was a little loud
of a "boo," Jessa.

09:26.708 --> 09:28.458
Oh, please, it's fine.

09:28.458 --> 09:31.166
That was unnecessary,
how loud that was.

09:31.166 --> 09:34.291
Children--
it's good for them
to hear loud noises

09:34.291 --> 09:35.834
and strange smells,

09:35.834 --> 09:38.792
and be around
strange men, you know?

09:38.792 --> 09:40.291
It's like,

09:40.291 --> 09:43.417
you don't want them
to be boring, Laird.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.000
Can I get you a tea
or something, or...?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.083
Please don't drink
from that.

09:47.083 --> 09:50.333
- Please don't
drink from that.
- I'm sorry.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.458
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry, Sample.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.667
All right,
it was a bit erratic,

09:54.667 --> 09:55.792
I will say,

09:55.792 --> 09:57.500
but I'm not doing great
right now.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.166
I'm not doing great.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.708
( sighs )
I can't pretend
that I don't care

10:01.708 --> 10:03.125
that Adam is upstairs
right now,

10:03.125 --> 10:04.625
upstairs with  Hannah.

10:04.625 --> 10:06.458
They're probably making,
like, flow graphs

10:06.458 --> 10:08.166
and chore charts
and figuring out

10:08.166 --> 10:10.125
how to raise her baby.

10:10.125 --> 10:11.166
Her  baby!

10:11.166 --> 10:12.333
Baby?

10:12.333 --> 10:14.291
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:14.291 --> 10:15.667
Hannah's pregnant,

10:15.667 --> 10:17.500
and Adam wants
to help her raise it.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.667
Mm-hmm.
It's not even his.
It's not even his.

10:20.667 --> 10:21.834
It's, um-- it's like

10:21.834 --> 10:24.000
some Bolivian
zip line guy's baby.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.959
Hannah's having
a Bolivian baby?

10:28.959 --> 10:30.917
Here I go.

10:32.041 --> 10:34.542
Hello?

10:34.542 --> 10:36.500
No one has talked
to this child.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.583
Knock, knock, child.

10:38.583 --> 10:39.959
( high-pitched )
Hello!

10:39.959 --> 10:41.792
( gasps )

10:41.792 --> 10:44.208
Do you hear
something?

10:44.208 --> 10:46.500
- ( high-pitched )
Hello, Adam.
- ( giggles )

10:46.500 --> 10:49.250
Hey. Hey, baby.

10:49.250 --> 10:53.375
( high-pitched )
Please... help me.

10:53.375 --> 10:56.417
My mom is so weird.

10:56.417 --> 10:58.750
- ( laughing )
- Oh-- what-- what?

10:58.750 --> 11:00.375
( high-pitched )
Help me!

11:00.375 --> 11:03.708
My mom is so weird!

11:03.708 --> 11:05.875
- Do you think
I'm weird?
- No.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.041
No?

11:07.041 --> 11:10.417
Seriously, it sounds
wild in there.

11:10.417 --> 11:14.250
It's like--
it's just insane.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.083
It's rushing...

11:17.291 --> 11:20.917
the sound
of waves crashing.

11:20.917 --> 11:24.250
A seashell...
It's wild in there.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.625
You can't hear
all those things.

11:29.375 --> 11:30.917
Everything is broken.

11:30.917 --> 11:32.834
Like, in the world,
or in this house?

11:32.834 --> 11:35.291
- In this house.
- ( laughs ) Oh!
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:35.291 --> 11:36.917
AC, the top lock.

11:36.917 --> 11:39.583
And you did
such a shitty job
patching that wall.

11:39.583 --> 11:42.500
Elijah did that
by himself.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.583
- Was he blindfolded?
- It's horrible.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.000
And you're the one who put
a giant hole in the wall,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.208
and then we had to patch it,
if you remember, so.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.125
- I'm sorry.
- ( knocking )

11:53.500 --> 11:55.792
Excuse me
for one second.

11:55.792 --> 11:57.000
( knocking )

11:57.000 --> 11:58.625
What?!

12:01.083 --> 12:02.834
Oh. Hey, man.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.834
Hey, what's up?
Is Hannah here?

12:04.834 --> 12:05.959
- Uh...
- Oh!

12:05.959 --> 12:07.583
- Laird!
- Hey, Hannah. Sorry!

12:07.583 --> 12:09.708
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.625
Sorry. Let me know
when you're decent.

12:11.625 --> 12:14.000
Laird, what are you
doing here?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.792
- Can I look?
- Yes, you can look.

12:15.792 --> 12:17.417
All right, great.

12:17.417 --> 12:18.750
Um, really sorry
to barge in.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.750
I don't know
what's up here.

12:20.750 --> 12:24.333
And if I interrupted
something, I'm sorry,
but this is important.

12:24.333 --> 12:27.458
I really, really felt
like it was important

12:27.458 --> 12:29.959
that I come up here
and make it known

12:29.959 --> 12:33.041
to both of you,
but mostly you,

12:33.041 --> 12:34.667
that I am here

12:34.667 --> 12:37.959
and totally up
for raising this baby.

12:37.959 --> 12:42.250
- What the fuck, Laird? No.
- I realized why I'm here.

12:42.250 --> 12:45.333
The purpose of my life
was to become a junkie

12:45.333 --> 12:48.333
so I could better,
so I could move into
this building,

12:48.333 --> 12:50.625
so I can meet you,
and we have that moment,

12:50.625 --> 12:52.500
and we establish
that base.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.417
And we go away from that,
which is fine,

12:54.417 --> 12:56.000
'cause then
I met Caroline.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.500
We had a baby,
she went away

12:58.500 --> 13:00.959
and ruined everything
and destroyed my life

13:00.959 --> 13:03.083
to give me the clarity
of this moment,

13:03.083 --> 13:05.333
which is
you're having a baby,

13:05.333 --> 13:06.917
you're about to be
a single parent.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.750
I am a single parent.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.708
It's so crystal clear!

13:10.708 --> 13:12.792
Mm. Ooh.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.959
Okay, two sips in
and I'm fully soused,

13:16.959 --> 13:20.500
- if I'm keeping it real.
- ( both chuckling )

13:22.708 --> 13:25.333
Ray, you never
drink during the day.
What are you doing?

13:25.333 --> 13:28.375
- Eh.
- It's good to try
new things, right?

13:28.375 --> 13:31.333
- Abelaide, I couldn't
agree with you more.
- Whoa. ( laughs )

13:31.333 --> 13:33.875
Abelaide?
Are you drunk?

13:33.875 --> 13:35.917
- Her name is Abigail.
- Abigail.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.834
- Abigail.
- Abigail.
Sorry about that.

13:37.834 --> 13:41.041
- Abigail.
- No, I thought
that was really cool.

13:41.041 --> 13:42.750
- I liked it.
- ( scoffs )

13:42.750 --> 13:45.125
Abigail:
Okay, I have a question
for you guys.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.333
It's a little bit
of a thinker, so buckle up.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.625
( clears throat )

13:49.625 --> 13:52.917
Would you rather live
in an ugly building

13:52.917 --> 13:55.625
with a view
of a gorgeous building

13:55.625 --> 14:00.125
or in a gorgeous building
with a view of an ugly building?

14:01.792 --> 14:02.708
Hmm?

14:03.750 --> 14:04.708
What?

14:05.750 --> 14:06.917
Are you serious?

14:06.917 --> 14:08.750
Yeah.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.750
What, you don't
have to answer it
if you don't want to.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.125
No, no,
it's not about that.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.583
It's just
that's my question.

14:17.667 --> 14:18.917
It's my question, too.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.792
That's my question.
( chuckles )

14:20.792 --> 14:22.417
That's the question
I ask other people.

14:22.417 --> 14:24.041
Well, it's also
my question.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.208
I ask it
to other people, too.

14:26.208 --> 14:30.083
Because I think it's, like,
the best way to kind of get down
to the heart of people.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.500
- You know, like,
see their true self?
- Totally!

14:32.500 --> 14:34.917
Exactly!
Their true, deepest,
most intimate selves.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.542
Exactly.
And of course we know
the correct answer.

14:37.542 --> 14:38.750
- Yeah, we all do.
- Yeah.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.959
Ugly building,
gorgeous view.

14:42.125 --> 14:43.625
- No.
- No.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.041
- No. ( chuckles )
- No.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.458
- No, Shosh.
- Not-- not at all.

14:47.458 --> 14:48.792
No, not even close.

14:48.792 --> 14:50.208
I see why you would
wanna say that.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.458
That's, like,
what everyone says,
you know?

14:52.458 --> 14:54.208
People always think
that's the right answer

14:54.208 --> 14:56.834
because it makes them
seem deep or whatever,
like,

14:56.834 --> 14:59.458
"Oh, I don't care
how things look,
blah, blah, blah."

14:59.458 --> 15:01.291
Right, but actually,
it's shallow in a weird way

15:01.291 --> 15:03.083
because it implies
that you're fine being
structurally flawed

15:03.083 --> 15:05.417
as long as you never
actually have to see
your true self.

15:05.417 --> 15:06.792
- Yeah.
- Right?

15:06.792 --> 15:08.333
- Yes!
- ( both chuckling )

15:08.333 --> 15:10.333
You were close, though.
Off by one.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.375
I'm just disconcerted.

15:14.375 --> 15:17.333
I don't understand
how you just decided--

15:17.333 --> 15:18.625
It's simple.

15:18.625 --> 15:21.083
I just knew,
you know?

15:21.083 --> 15:22.750
Well, I--
I knew deep down.

15:22.750 --> 15:25.625
I didn't really know
until I heard about the baby.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.291
Then I knew
in my actual brain.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.500
You know, but it's--
there's-- it's simple.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.083
There's too much
history here.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.333
There's too much good stuff
for us not to try.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.166
What about
you and Jessa?

15:37.166 --> 15:39.000
Aren't you guys in,
like, mad, passionate love?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Aren't you gonna,
like, run away together
on two bicycles or...?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.834
Oh, you know.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.542
She would've
left me in four months.
I did us both a favor.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.375
What's it like
to fuck Jessa?

15:49.375 --> 15:52.166
Ah! Virgin ears.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.667
You have to know
that this was, like,
my number one question

15:54.667 --> 15:56.208
I've been waiting
all day to ask you.

15:57.208 --> 15:59.166
All right.
Okay, okay, fine.

16:00.708 --> 16:04.041
There's more laughing.
She laughs a lot.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.834
Like, she laughs
during sex?

16:05.834 --> 16:07.667
- Yeah.
- Like a fucking freak?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.000
Excuse me.
I don't wanna judge.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.708
No, like a person
who laughs.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.834
Like, she laughs 'cause
she's less comfortable
with sex

16:12.834 --> 16:14.583
than you'd think she'd be,
considering the shape
of her body

16:14.583 --> 16:16.000
and the style
of her hair?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.083
♪ This is why
I didn't wanna do this. ♪

16:19.083 --> 16:23.375
- If you're not gonna
share anything with me...
- ♪ Share it with me... ♪

16:23.375 --> 16:25.917
- ...then you
should just know...
- ♪ Then you should just know. ♪

16:27.417 --> 16:28.542
You look very pretty.

16:28.542 --> 16:30.083
Fuck you.

16:34.041 --> 16:37.041
You know,
I've been really scared
since I found out.

16:38.083 --> 16:39.375
Like, terrified.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.000
I mean,
I didn't wanna
tell everyone

16:41.000 --> 16:42.834
'cause I don't want
people to think I'm insane.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.208
And I know I want
a baby someday,

16:45.208 --> 16:47.917
so why not
make someday now?

16:47.917 --> 16:51.458
But I've been
so, so scared.

16:51.458 --> 16:52.792
What if my baby's
really sick

16:52.792 --> 16:54.667
and it's crying
and I don't wake up

16:54.667 --> 16:57.375
because I just took
a little piece of an Ambien,
but I can't wake up?

16:57.375 --> 16:59.417
What if I feed the baby
a piece of food that's
too big for it

16:59.417 --> 17:01.417
and it chokes,
but its eyes are so wide

17:01.417 --> 17:03.917
that I just think it's, like,
looking at me happily,
and then it's dead?

17:03.917 --> 17:06.040
- Jesus!
- I could put my kid
in a car seat,

17:06.040 --> 17:07.791
and then when I get out
to get into the front seat,

17:07.791 --> 17:10.208
a drunk driver gets me,
the ambulance comes,
takes my body away,

17:10.208 --> 17:13.040
they don't know
a baby was back there,
and that baby starves to death.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.000
The car gets impounded,
the baby's stuck in the car.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.583
Well, uh,
I'll be here.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.250
So, now I know
you wanna be with me

17:21.250 --> 17:24.083
just to make sure
I don't fuck everything up.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.416
Why do you want
a baby?

17:29.792 --> 17:32.625
You know when you're a teenager
and you're, like, not ready
to have sex?

17:32.625 --> 17:34.792
- No.
- Okay, wrong example

17:34.792 --> 17:39.125
since you lost your virginity
at 13 to, like, a lifeguard
or something.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.291
You know
when you're a little kid

17:41.291 --> 17:43.125
and you're not ready
to have a sleepover?

17:43.125 --> 17:44.625
- Yes!
- Yes!

17:44.625 --> 17:46.041
And it's, like,
kindergarten or first grade

17:46.041 --> 17:47.917
and sleepovers
are, like, all the rage

17:47.917 --> 17:49.917
and everyone's doing it
every Friday and Saturday night,

17:49.917 --> 17:51.417
and you're just like,
"No, I can't.

17:51.417 --> 17:53.083
I need to be with my mom,
I need to have my own sheets,

17:53.083 --> 17:54.959
I need to have
my own toilet.
I can't."

17:54.959 --> 17:57.125
- Yes.
- And then one day,
someone asks you.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.375
They're like,
"Would you like
to sleep over on Friday?"

17:59.375 --> 18:00.750
And you're like...

18:02.291 --> 18:03.583
"Oh, my God.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.125
Not only am I ready,
I have to be there."

18:07.125 --> 18:09.708
Mine was with
a boy named Joel.

18:09.708 --> 18:11.667
- Joel?
- Yeah.

18:11.667 --> 18:14.250
- His parents kept a bunch
of rottweilers in cages.
- Oh, cool.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.667
I remember this moment
where we were

18:15.667 --> 18:17.041
sitting on his couch
watching "Caddyshack"

18:17.041 --> 18:18.583
and my hand
started to shake.

18:18.583 --> 18:19.959
It's what happens
when I'm about to puke.

18:19.959 --> 18:22.333
- Oh.
- And I thought, "Oh, no!

18:22.333 --> 18:25.083
This can't happen!
If I puke, they'll
send me home.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.667
And if they send me home,
I'm fucking nothing!"

18:27.667 --> 18:29.375
That's so cute!

18:29.375 --> 18:30.834
Yeah, but I was
very small.

18:30.834 --> 18:32.333
- So you know what I did?
- What?

18:32.333 --> 18:34.333
- I swallowed it.
- You swallowed it?

18:34.333 --> 18:36.750
Yeah, every bit of puke,
I just swallowed it.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.667
- No way.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.333
That's insane!

18:40.333 --> 18:43.083
Well, you know,
there's levels of insane,

18:43.083 --> 18:45.333
but, yeah,
it was necessary.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.792
And, you know,
I made it through.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.875
And after that,
I was the fucking
sleepover king.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.875
( seagulls screeching )

18:58.250 --> 18:59.667
Don't be scared.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.542
Okay.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.542
( boat horn blares )

19:08.041 --> 19:10.166
( sputters )
Fucking shit!

19:10.166 --> 19:12.083
- What?
- You shouldn't have that!

19:12.083 --> 19:14.708
It's full of green dye
and sugar syrup

19:14.708 --> 19:16.125
and shit
baby's shouldn't have!

19:16.125 --> 19:17.375
Fuck!

19:18.458 --> 19:19.542
You bought it
for me!

19:19.542 --> 19:21.375
I want
the rest of my soda!

19:21.375 --> 19:23.333
- Mm-mm.
- Give me my soda!

19:23.333 --> 19:24.792
No.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.208
I can't have
any of my soda?

anything that I really like.

21:42.208 --> 21:45.375
Hannah:
I mean, I guess it's not
all gonna look great.

21:45.375 --> 21:48.166
I mean, at the end of the day,
it's just not the most
chic furniture,

21:48.166 --> 21:49.333
and that's fine.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.708
Yeah.

21:54.959 --> 21:56.708
Bingo.

21:56.708 --> 21:58.583
Yeah, I think we need
one of those.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.708
We need
a couple of these.

22:00.708 --> 22:04.041
Remember, I could build
a lot of this shit myself.

22:04.041 --> 22:06.041
- The quality
will be better.
- Mm-hmm.

22:06.041 --> 22:09.625
And it won't be
leaking toxic ooze
all over our kid.

22:09.625 --> 22:12.875
I figure,
to start, you know,
I'll just build a crib

22:12.875 --> 22:16.041
and a simple bureau
to hold all the baby shit.

22:16.041 --> 22:18.583
And the top of the bureau
we can use as a changing table,

22:18.583 --> 22:20.166
so that's--
that's cool, too.

22:20.166 --> 22:22.166
And that-- you know,
that's all you really need.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.417
Oh, plus
one of those, um...

Hannah?

22:45.834 --> 22:47.583
( barks, chuckles )

22:47.583 --> 22:49.291
- Sorry.
- ( chuckles )

22:49.291 --> 22:50.417
Where'd you go?

22:52.250 --> 22:54.083
I was just, like, realizing
that I haven't had anyone

22:54.083 --> 22:56.708
to talk about this stuff with,
so, I'm just kind of, like,

22:56.708 --> 23:01.625
processing all the stuff
that we'll need for the house.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.417
Oh, yeah.

23:05.708 --> 23:07.458
Yeah.
I'm excited.

23:08.458 --> 23:09.917
I'm just excited
to get out

23:09.917 --> 23:12.417
of my own fucking head
for a while, you know?

23:12.417 --> 23:13.625
Aren't you?

23:14.875 --> 23:15.792
Yeah.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.458
Why didn't you
have to work today?

23:18.458 --> 23:22.250
Didn't you just inherit
a big coffee empire?

23:22.250 --> 23:24.125
( chuckles ) Kind of.
It's complicated.

23:24.125 --> 23:27.083
I inherited some properties
and some businesses,

23:27.083 --> 23:29.083
but-- I don't know.

23:29.083 --> 23:30.625
I guess I'm at a crossroads
with all of it

23:30.625 --> 23:32.291
because my boss,
Hermie...

23:32.291 --> 23:34.458
- Mm-hmm.
- ...my late boss, Hermie...

23:34.458 --> 23:36.708
- Yeah.
- ...he started
this project

23:36.708 --> 23:40.250
and I guess, in my own way,
I'm trying to continue it,
and-- I don't know.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.959
I don't have
Hermie's natural knack
for making conversations.

23:42.959 --> 23:44.708
Just-- I don't know.
It's not in me.

23:44.708 --> 23:46.500
I'm not as sociable
as I ever thought I'd be.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.083
Well, then
we should practice.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.750
- Practice?
- Mm-hmm.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.125
What do you mean
practice?

23:52.125 --> 23:53.917
- Ray: Hello.
- Abigail: Hello, ladies.

23:53.917 --> 23:55.250
We're trying to make,
like, a--

23:55.250 --> 23:57.667
an audio history
of Brooklyn.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.333
Can we ask you
a couple questions?

23:59.333 --> 24:01.000
How long have you
lived in Brooklyn?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.792
- Oh, about almost 90 years.
- That's amazing.

24:03.792 --> 24:06.166
What was a typical
Friday night in Brooklyn?

24:06.166 --> 24:10.667
Was there ever a boy
who managed to come between
your beautiful friendship?

24:10.667 --> 24:12.625
I got him.
You don't know that,
but I got him,

24:12.625 --> 24:14.792
You didn't!
You did not get him.

24:14.792 --> 24:17.000
What would you wear
on, like, a night out?

24:17.000 --> 24:20.417
If you could choose one thing,
what is it that's changed
the neighborhood?

24:20.417 --> 24:24.625
Nowadays,
you go down the street,
all you see is these SUVs here.

24:24.625 --> 24:27.792
And-- and they even have
these SUV strollers.

24:27.792 --> 24:29.375
What was it
you wanted to know?

24:29.375 --> 24:32.166
Um, actually, um,

24:32.166 --> 24:35.041
this special person
is gonna ask you
the question.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.500
Um, yeah.

24:36.500 --> 24:40.500
So, well,
what do you miss most
about the neighborhood?

24:40.500 --> 24:42.917
What was it about you
that he fell in love with?

24:42.917 --> 24:45.875
And why did your family
choose to settle
in Brooklyn?

24:45.875 --> 24:47.792
I came here
for vacation.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.041
You came 40 years ago
from Poland for a vacation

24:50.041 --> 24:52.250
- and you stayed?
- Yes, I stayed vacation.

24:52.250 --> 24:55.417
I miss old-school Brooklyn.
I miss block parties.

24:55.417 --> 24:59.458
I miss not having someone
complain about the noise

24:59.458 --> 25:00.667
or complain
about anything.

25:03.291 --> 25:05.417
I'm happy to give
my apartment up.

25:05.417 --> 25:06.917
It's month-to-month
anyway.

25:06.917 --> 25:08.208
It's month-to-month?

25:08.208 --> 25:09.750
You've lived there
for, like, eight years.

25:09.750 --> 25:10.750
Yeah, it's a good deal.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.708
I guess I could
give my apartment up.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.333
I mean, I'm not gonna
kick Elijah out.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.166
He's been, like,
such an amazing friend to me

25:17.166 --> 25:19.166
and he's finally really
getting somewhere in his life

25:19.166 --> 25:20.625
and trying so hard,
and...

25:20.625 --> 25:22.542
Yeah, maybe we just
find a new place.

25:22.542 --> 25:25.166
There's a lot on craigslist
that doesn't require a broker.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.500
Yeah, very cool.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.375
Oh, right!

25:28.375 --> 25:31.625
I've been on this list
for artist housing
for, like, forever.

25:31.625 --> 25:34.500
They tend to favor
married couples, though,

25:34.500 --> 25:36.375
so it might help
if we did that.

25:39.208 --> 25:41.542
Yeah, and I guess
it's time to finally
join a food co-op.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.375
It's, like, I don't know,
I've never wanted to

25:43.375 --> 25:45.583
'cause I find
the whole shift thing
kind of demeaning, but...

25:45.583 --> 25:48.625
Well, I can do them all
if you handle the bills
and stuff like that.

25:48.625 --> 25:51.917
I'm-- I'm still not great
with computers.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.500
( chatter )

26:06.625 --> 26:08.625
( music playing )

26:17.542 --> 26:19.000
( sniffles )

26:34.333 --> 26:36.000
What's the rest
of your night look like?

26:38.625 --> 26:39.667
Uh...

26:41.834 --> 26:43.458
I'm gonna go
to my house
and write,

26:43.458 --> 26:45.291
and then probably
try to go to sleep.

26:45.291 --> 26:47.667
- You?
- I guess I'm gonna
grocery shop.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.708
Good soup.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.041
Shit!

27:16.166 --> 27:18.583
( clicking )

27:22.750 --> 27:24.708
( line ringing )

27:27.750 --> 27:29.750
- Jessa: Hello?
- Hey, you home?

27:29.750 --> 27:31.875
- Uh-huh.
- Go to the window.

27:37.625 --> 27:40.375
If I buzz,
will you let me in?

27:40.375 --> 27:41.708
Yeah.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.792
- ( AC whirring )
- ( dog barking )

27:54.708 --> 27:57.208
( carousel music playing )

28:06.166 --> 28:08.125
( music continues )

28:08.125 --> 28:09.375
Man:
Whoo-hoo!

28:12.792 --> 28:14.417
You were good today.

28:14.417 --> 28:15.500
- Me?
- Yes!

28:15.500 --> 28:16.708
Are you crazy?
It was all you!

28:16.708 --> 28:18.166
You got complete strangers
to open up.

28:18.166 --> 28:20.041
- It was unbelievable.
- It was teamwork.

28:20.041 --> 28:22.625
Well, you led the charge,
I just followed.

28:22.625 --> 28:25.375
I can't handle you saying
"Led the charge"

28:25.375 --> 28:27.041
while you're
sitting on a horse.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.375
It's really fun
hanging out with you.

28:31.458 --> 28:32.583
Thanks.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.667
Would you object greatly
if I kissed you?

29:05.750 --> 29:07.959
( music continues )

30:36.917 --> 30:37.917
HANNAH:
I don't know, I mean,

30:38.458 --> 30:39.708
can't someone tell me exactly
what to do,

30:39.708 --> 30:41.417
but in a way that makes it seem
like it's my idea?

30:42.083 --> 30:43.083
(PHONE RINGS)

30:43.083 --> 30:43.959
HANNAH: Marn, where are you?

30:44.375 --> 30:45.291
OK, I'm trying to
figure something out,

30:45.291 --> 30:46.291
and I really need you.

30:47.250 --> 30:49.125
Why didn't you answer
any of my calls all day?

30:50.917 --> 30:52.208
-Hey!
-Not you,

30:52.208 --> 30:53.500
and not now, not in the mood.

30:53.917 --> 30:55.250
We're having a group meeting.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.959
I don't want to have
a group meeting.

30:56.959 --> 30:58.542
Probably about the only thing
we can all agree on.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.792
We agreed to live here,

31:01.041 --> 31:02.875
and suffer, and be miserable,

31:02.875 --> 31:05.250
in this god-forsaken rathole,
together.

31:06.041 --> 31:07.291
You can't give up on that.

31:12.041 --> 31:13.625
I want to raise
your child with you.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.291
I'm so confused.

31:18.834 --> 31:20.834
I need you to say that title,
'cause you wrote it.

31:20.834 --> 31:23.125
"What Will We Do This Time
About Adam?"

31:23.125 --> 31:24.500
-Yes.
-I thought of that idea?

31:24.875 --> 31:26.291
It was the weirdest thing ever.
I was on the phone with Judd,

31:26.291 --> 31:27.583
we had written
the episode together,

31:27.792 --> 31:29.834
and I had given it some name
like, uh...

31:30.041 --> 31:31.625
"Last Hurrah!" or something.

31:31.625 --> 31:33.500
And Judd was like,
"I think we should call it--"

31:33.500 --> 31:35.166
And it was as if he was
making it up as he went along.

31:35.166 --> 31:38.542
(SLOWLY) "What Will We Do
This Time About Adam?"

31:38.542 --> 31:40.625
-Like it's not totally English.
-(APATOW LAUGHS)

31:40.625 --> 31:41.625
(KONNER LAUGHS)

31:42.291 --> 31:44.625
And I was just like, "Okay."
And that's what the title was.

31:44.625 --> 31:46.750
Judd always wants, also,
just historically,

31:46.750 --> 31:49.291
-the most literal titles ever.
-Yeah.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.125
Hey.

31:53.291 --> 31:54.000
Hey.

31:54.792 --> 31:56.959
DUNHAM: We had talked a lot
about this idea

31:56.959 --> 31:59.375
of this last hurrah
between Hannah and Adam

31:59.375 --> 32:00.500
and what that would look like.

32:01.041 --> 32:03.083
APATOW: Well, we have
this idea that they would just

32:03.083 --> 32:04.000
give it a shot

32:04.291 --> 32:06.375
and really quickly
run out of gas.

32:06.667 --> 32:07.834
-They just--
-DUNHAM: Yeah.

32:07.834 --> 32:08.834
There's just nothing there,

32:09.166 --> 32:10.417
and there's a moment
of excitement,

32:10.834 --> 32:13.375
like, "Maybe now we can do it.
Maybe now we're mature."

32:13.375 --> 32:14.417
And then they realize

32:14.917 --> 32:16.834
they're just not that interested
in each other anymore.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.667
That whole episode was really
emotional to shoot,

32:19.667 --> 32:23.834
because Adam's been such
an amazing, like, acting partner

32:23.834 --> 32:26.041
and teacher to me,
and I knew it was the last time

32:26.041 --> 32:28.166
we were gonna do
any performing together,

32:28.166 --> 32:30.500
and so there was
a real bittersweetness

32:30.500 --> 32:31.667
to the entire thing.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.750
And also, there's a part
of everyone

32:33.750 --> 32:35.667
that did kind of want
Adam and Hannah to...

32:35.667 --> 32:39.375
Their-- It's a real love story.
Like, it was a big choice to go,

32:39.375 --> 32:41.625
like, "No, these people actually
are not meant to be together."

32:41.625 --> 32:44.000
And this complicated
relationship he has with Jessa

32:44.000 --> 32:45.375
is where he's supposed to be.

32:45.583 --> 32:48.208
And I remember going to the set,
and I was just amazed

32:48.208 --> 32:52.375
that every kid on the street
was now just staring at Adam,

32:52.375 --> 32:53.834
-Yeah.
-and walking up to him

32:53.834 --> 32:55.708
-with their lightsabers.
-DUNHAM: It was wild.

32:55.708 --> 32:57.750
And it makes you think, oh,
this is, you know,

32:57.750 --> 33:01.250
this great actor that, uh,
you know, we saw a long time ago

33:01.250 --> 33:02.875
and thought, "Oh, he seems--
he seems pretty good."

33:03.083 --> 33:05.333
-KONNER AND DUNHAM: Yeah.
-APATOW: And now kids are

33:05.333 --> 33:08.333
walking up to him like they're
walking up to Harrison Ford.

33:08.792 --> 33:10.875
-Hi.
-No smoking.

33:11.667 --> 33:14.875
Come on.
Giuliani always let us.

33:15.291 --> 33:17.041
DUNHAM: And, I mean, I think
what we thought about

33:17.041 --> 33:19.375
was Jessa trying to go back
to her old tricks,

33:19.375 --> 33:21.375
to what numbed her
and comforted her before,

33:21.583 --> 33:23.917
and realizing that
it didn't work anymore.

33:24.250 --> 33:25.625
The shot of her walking
down the street

33:25.917 --> 33:27.750
and into the bar is,
you know, verbatim

33:27.750 --> 33:29.792
the same tracking shot
that we did

33:29.792 --> 33:32.417
in, um, Season One, Episode Two,

33:32.625 --> 33:37.750
when she goes into the bar
and hooks up with a random guy

33:37.750 --> 33:38.917
and realizes
she's not pregnant.

33:39.375 --> 33:41.917
And that is like... There is
a really stark contrast.

33:42.250 --> 33:45.458
She's always talked the talk
of being the cool girl
who is up for whatever.

33:45.458 --> 33:46.834
And "I don't care
about monogamy,"

33:47.166 --> 33:49.208
and "This is important to me,"
and "I don't get jealous."

33:49.208 --> 33:51.250
And so to really test her
on that and see that, like,

33:51.458 --> 33:54.583
actually, no, she did want to
be in a monogamous relationship,

33:54.583 --> 33:56.667
and just like everybody else,
there's certain things

33:56.667 --> 33:59.083
that even the least traditional
girl in the world

33:59.083 --> 34:01.583
actually feels attached to.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.458
If I buzz, will you let me in?

34:05.834 --> 34:06.708
Yeah.

34:07.417 --> 34:08.583
DUNHAM: And there's something
really beautiful

34:09.083 --> 34:10.291
about that moment
when he comes home to her,

34:10.833 --> 34:11.958
and there's also something
really sad about it

34:12.458 --> 34:13.792
because she knows
that he's coming home

34:14.041 --> 34:15.708
'cause he tried this other thing
and it failed.

34:15.708 --> 34:18.958
And so there's
a real sad ambiguity

34:18.958 --> 34:20.500
to her letting him back up.

34:20.833 --> 34:24.125
-This is Ray, by the way. So...
-Oh, hi. Hello.

34:24.125 --> 34:26.750
DUNHAM: Something that,
to me, was really powerful
in that episode

34:26.750 --> 34:29.708
is the Abigail and Ray
storyline.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.917
And they're so funny together,
and I remember

34:31.917 --> 34:34.542
we were talking about
stories through the year,

34:34.542 --> 34:37.000
-and just how much
we love Aidy Bryant.
-KONNER: Oh!

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
-KONNER: She's the best.
-And like, "What do we do
with her?"

34:39.000 --> 34:40.833
"Is there anything else
to do with her?"

34:40.833 --> 34:44.333
And just this idea of, "Oh, Ray
would fall in love with her."

34:44.333 --> 34:47.750
Right. And it was just, like,
so great to give Ray

34:47.750 --> 34:51.125
that finale, too. Like, he wound
up with this, like,

34:51.708 --> 34:54.000
just delightful, positive...

34:54.000 --> 34:57.166
After being kind of, like,
beaten down by Marnie

34:57.166 --> 34:58.875
and even Shosh at the end
of their relationship.

34:58.875 --> 35:00.291
-APATOW: Yeah.
-Beaten down
by rude millennials.

35:00.625 --> 35:04.667
Yeah, like he got the sweet wasp
who loves everything.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.667
-DUNHAM: I know.
-I was just so happy for him.

35:06.667 --> 35:09.375
And I just--
I loved that story line.
