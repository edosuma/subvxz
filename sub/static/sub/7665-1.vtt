<i>Say, it's only a paper moon</i>

01:00.477 --> 01:03.374
<i>Sailing over a cardboard sea</i>

01:03.688 --> 01:06.377
<i>But it wouldn't be make-believe</i>

01:06.483 --> 01:09.214
<i>If you believed in me</i>

01:10.303 --> 01:13.635
<i>Yes, it's only a canvas sky</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:16.930
<i>Hanging over a cotton tree</i>

01:17.035 --> 01:19.516
<i>But it wouldn't be make-believe</i>

01:19.829 --> 01:22.936
<i>If you believed in me</i>

01:23.374 --> 01:25.897
<i>Without your love</i>

01:26.002 --> 01:29.609
<i>It's a honky-tonk parade</i>

01:29.714 --> 01:32.612
<i>Without your love</i>

01:32.717 --> 01:36.157
<i>It's a melody played in a penny arcade</i>

01:36.971 --> 01:40.161
<i>It's a Barnum and Bailey world</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:43.123
<i>Just as hollow as it can be</i>

01:43.478 --> 01:46.292
<i>But it wouldn't be make-believe</i>

01:46.397 --> 01:49.045
<i>If you believed in me</i>

01:52.278 --> 01:56.427
<i>Rock of ages, cleft for me</i>

01:56.533 --> 02:01.099
<i>Let me hide myself in thee</i>

02:01.788 --> 02:05.979
<i>Let the water and the blood</i>

02:06.668 --> 02:11.609
<i>From thy wounded side which flowed</i>

02:11.714 --> 02:16.698
<i>Be of sin the double cure</i>

02:17.178 --> 02:22.370
<i>Safe from wrath and make me pure</i>

02:23.458 --> 02:25.165
"Judge me, oh Lord,

02:25.270 --> 02:27.625
"for I have lost in mine integrity.

02:28.731 --> 02:32.088
"I have trusted also in the Lord,

02:32.193 --> 02:34.924
"therefore I shall not slide.

02:35.905 --> 02:39.637
"Examine me, oh Lord, and prove me.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.516
"Try my reins and my heart,

02:43.621 --> 02:47.812
"for Thy loving kindness
is before mine eyes

02:47.917 --> 02:50.565
"and I have walked in Thy truth.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.652
"I have not sat with evil persons.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.698
"Neither will I go in with dissemblers.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.576
"I will wash mine hands

03:01.681 --> 03:03.828
"in innocency.

03:03.933 --> 03:08.124
"So will I compass Thine altar, O Lord,

03:09.105 --> 03:13.046
"that I may publish
with the voice of thanksgiving

03:13.151 --> 03:15.089
"and tell of all Thy wondrous works..."

03:15.195 --> 03:16.633
Howdy.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.760
Loggins' funeral.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.553
Yes, ma'am.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.515
- You ain't related, are ya?
- Related, ma'am?

03:24.621 --> 03:29.187
We're looking for the child's kin.
Thought I saw some resemblance.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.899
No kin, huh?

03:33.004 --> 03:35.109
None we know of,
'cept out in Missouri someplace.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.570
- Missouri...
- Seems you got the child's jaw.

03:37.675 --> 03:40.240
No, ma'am, just a friend of her mama's,
just passing through town.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.867
If ever a child needed a friend.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.662
"...will I bless the Lord.

03:45.767 --> 03:46.996
"Amen."

03:47.101 --> 03:48.790
Amen.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.547
Amen, Essie Maye.
I just know your ass is still warm.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.216
Would you like some water, Addie?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.260
We'll get the child some water.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.352
Bless you child, I just want to pay
my respects to your mama.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.730
Well, I'm going to have to be going.
It's a long way to St. Louis.

04:12.835 --> 04:15.525
- St. Louis? You mean in Missouri?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.192
I... I sell the good book, ma'am.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.362
Just moving through the country
with the Lord's good news.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.615
Addie, child, don't you have
your Aunt Billie living in St. Joseph?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.117
St. Joseph, Missouri.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.286
It's her poor mother's sister.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.080
- The child's only known relative.
- That so?

04:29.185 --> 04:32.792
You're driving your chariot to Missouri, sir.
You could deliver this child to her kin folk.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.877
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a chariot, Reverend.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.839
- I'll write the women a letter tonight.
- Hold it, hold it.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.591
I have to think upon this,
you know, uh...

04:40.697 --> 04:42.969
I mean, I may have to make
a few stops along the way.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.762
I never travelled with no child before.

04:44.867 --> 04:48.182
- But you're going that way.
- The child's got no place to go.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.059
Well...

04:51.332 --> 04:54.230
The eyes of the Lord...
Expect I have no choice, do I?

04:54.335 --> 04:56.899
- Hallelujah!
- God works in mysterious ways.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.401
Don't he now?

04:58.506 --> 05:00.361
Come on, Addie.
Better get your things together.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.323
This nice man's going to take
you to your aunt.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.793
- How come you're taking me?
- Huh?

05:15.898 --> 05:17.503
How come you're taking me?

05:17.608 --> 05:19.756
Because I'm going that way, honey.

05:20.570 --> 05:24.260
Although, I do want to make just one stop
before we leave town.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.847
Got a little business to take care of.

05:27.952 --> 05:31.225
- You know my mama real good?
- Oh, pretty good.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.832
You just stay out here
till I come for you.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.709
Don't you say a word
unless I ask you to.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.669
Mr Robertson?

05:58.775 --> 06:00.588
- That's right.
- I'd like a minute of your time.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.340
- Not buying today.
- Oh, not selling.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.343
Just want you to meet somebody,
Mr Robertson. Only take a second.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.469
So what?

06:06.574 --> 06:08.012
- Tell him your name, honey.
- Addie.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.639
- Addie what, honey?
- Addie Loggins.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.144
You done real fine.
I'll be out in a minute.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.022
Ain't she a sweet child?

06:18.127 --> 06:19.982
No, she ain't a sweet child.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.693
Well, maybe she don't seem sweet right now.
That's because she's sad.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.070
That is with her mama being dead,

06:24.175 --> 06:26.906
what with your brother getting drunk
and driving into that tree like that.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.908
What are you trying to pull?
Get out of here!

06:29.013 --> 06:31.494
All right, I'm going, but let me tell you
where I'm going to go.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.121
I don't care where you're going to go.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.914
I'm going to go see Mr J.T. Faraday.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.125
Now, you know who Mr J.T. Faraday is?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.085
He's one of the biggest lawyers
in Kansas.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.796
And he don't favour the man with the money,
he favours the man without it.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.840
And you know what's gonna happen
to your brother?

06:43.945 --> 06:46.342
There's gonna be a lawsuit against him.
You know what happens then?

06:46.447 --> 06:49.053
Everything's gonna be just tied up
in knots, just sitting there.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.765
That's his banking money,
his house, everything he owns.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.892
Including half this plant.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.687
Now, don't think that poor child
ain't entitled, 'cause she is.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.900
I was thinking...

07:03.005 --> 07:04.735
couple a thousand dollars
would be acceptable.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.737
Couple of thou? I'll give you 200.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.199
$200?

07:10.304 --> 07:11.325
$200.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.204
It's a deal.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.624
There you are.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.765
That'll be, uh, $67.54.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.350
You sure these tyres are new?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.437
$67.54.

07:48.926 --> 07:52.158
Now, we'll have you
to St. Jo in no time.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.328
What time's the next train
to St. Joseph?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.872
St. Joseph? Let's see here.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.790
That'll be the 4:14.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.586
Change trains in Kansas City,
and that'll put you into St. Jo at 9:52am.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.921
I want one child's price ticket.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.470
That will be $11.45.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.097
I want you to send this here telegram
to Mrs Billie Roy Griggs,

08:15.203 --> 08:16.724
Cosmo Road, St. Joseph.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.684
Train arriving 9:52am,

08:18.789 --> 08:21.145
and bringing love,
affection and $20 cash.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.065
Oh, make that $25 cash.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.484
And sign it just Addie Loggins.

08:27.048 --> 08:30.321
Ten words, that will be 85 cents more.

08:30.426 --> 08:32.948
That will be 12 and 30.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.616
12 and 30, huh?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.869
Uh, you better say
in that message there,

08:36.974 --> 08:39.163
love, affection and $20 cash.

08:39.268 --> 08:42.332
Love, affection and $20 cash.

08:54.992 --> 08:58.140
Now, here's your ticket,
and here's $20 for your Aunt Billie.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.105
Well, we got till 4:15.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.525
I don't suppose you can wait
here by yourself, can you?

09:12.134 --> 09:13.781
You hungry?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.616
You want a Nehi and a Coney Island?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.939
- Ain't you gonna eat it?
- I ain't hungry.

09:47.044 --> 09:50.192
D'you worry about going on the train?
You'll like the train. Don't worry about it.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.195
Before you know it, you'll be asleep in your
aunt's house, all your troubles will be over.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.615
- So eat your Coney Island.
- She don't even know me.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.700
- She's going to know you now.
- She ain't gonna want me.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.952
What are you making trouble for?
She ain't even seen you, yet.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.872
- She never even cared for my mama.
- Nobody didn't care for your mama.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.583
- And she was her sister.
- Your mama was a fine woman.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.834
Everybody said she weren't.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.211
Well everybody don't know
your mama, do they?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.464
How good you know my mama?

10:11.569 --> 10:14.550
Good enough to know you can be real proud
of the happiness she give to people.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.385
Now, eat your Coney Island.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.140
You meet my mama in a bar room?

10:21.245 --> 10:22.933
Where would you get
a question like that?

10:23.039 --> 10:26.312
I hear Miss Ollie talking, the neighbour
lady. Says one of you's my pa.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.023
Well, don't the world
have a wild imagination?

10:31.422 --> 10:33.361
Eat your Coney Island.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.488
You my pa?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.783
Of course I ain't your pa.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.534
I'll get you some relish.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.330
A Coney Island ain't no good
without relish.

10:45.436 --> 10:48.709
Look, I know how you feel.
I lost my ma, too. I even lost my pa.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.961
I don't even know where my sister is.

10:51.067 --> 10:54.632
I wish I could tell you I'm your pa,
but it just ain't like that.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.761
You met her in a bar room.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.889
Just because a man meets a woman
in a bar room don't mean he's your pa.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.974
Eat your Coney Island.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.107
Well, then, if you ain't my pa,
I want my $200.

11:11.962 --> 11:12.983
What's that?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.611
I want my $200.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.738
I heard you through the door
talking to that man.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.782
It's my money you got, and I want it.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.034
Now, you... you just hold on a second.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.954
I want my money. You took my $200!

11:25.059 --> 11:27.832
- Will you quiet down, you hear?
- I want my $200!

11:27.937 --> 11:30.209
Hold on, now, just hold on.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.711
Let me explain something to you.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.879
It ain't as if you was my pa.
That'd be different.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.965
Well, I ain't your pa,
so just get that out of your head.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.717
I don't care
what those neighbour ladies said.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.176
- I look like that.
- You don't look nothing like me.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.595
You don't look any more like me
than you do that Coney Island.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.013
Eat that damn thing, you hear?

11:43.119 --> 11:45.725
- We got the same jaw.
- Lots of people got the same jaw.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.185
- It's possible.
- No, no, it ain't possible.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.771
- Then I want my $200!
- All right!

11:51.460 --> 11:54.024
All right, maybe we got the same jaw,
but same jaw don't mean same blood.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.694
I know a woman looks like a bullfrog,
but that don't mean she's its mother.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.239
- You met my mum in a bar room.
- For God's sakes, child!

12:00.344 --> 12:02.366
You think everybody gets met
in a bar room gets a baby?

12:02.471 --> 12:03.659
It's possible.

12:03.764 --> 12:07.496
Anything is possible,
but possible don't make it true.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.749
Then I want my money!

12:09.854 --> 12:12.042
Will you quiet down?

12:13.607 --> 12:16.839
You know what the trouble is with you?
You got no appreciation.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.340
All right.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.343
Maybe I did get a little money from that man,
and you're entitled to that,

12:21.449 --> 12:24.138
but I'm entitled to my share
for getting it for you, ain't I?

12:24.243 --> 12:26.098
And where do you think
you'd be without me?

12:26.203 --> 12:29.477
You think them folks would spend a penny
to send you east? No, sir.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.688
But who got you a ticket to St. Jo?
Who got you a Nehi and a Coney Island?

12:32.793 --> 12:34.440
And threw in $20 extra,

12:34.545 --> 12:36.901
not to mention 85 cents
for that telegram.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.361
You wouldn't have had
any of that without me.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.864
Now, I didn't have to take you,
but I took you, didn't I?

12:41.969 --> 12:44.408
All right, I think that's fair enough.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.786
We're both a little better off.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.622
You get to St. Jo,
I get myself a little better car.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.791
Fair is fair.

12:52.938 --> 12:56.170
Now, drink your Nehi,
and eat your Coney Island.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.383
I want my $200.

13:02.406 --> 13:06.639
I don't have your $200 no more,
and you know it.

13:07.411 --> 13:11.769
If you don't give me my $200,
I'm going to tell a policeman how you got it,

13:11.874 --> 13:14.355
and he'll make you give it to me,
'cause it's mine.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.567
But I don't have it.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.654
Then get it.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.535
How we doing, Angel Pie?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.538
We going to have a little dessert
when we finish up our hot dog?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.248
I don't know.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.541
What do you say, Daddy?

13:33.646 --> 13:36.919
Why don't we get Precious
a little dessert if she eats her dog?

13:37.024 --> 13:40.464
Her name ain't Precious.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.803
I want my money back on this here ticket,
and I want you to send this here telegram.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.848
Trip delayed, but I'm coming real soon!

14:20.609 --> 14:22.214
You just lie down in the seat
and be quiet.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.009
Folks don't take to children
when they're doing business.

14:59.652 --> 15:01.045
- Yes?
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.422
- Is Mr Rudolf Morgan at home, please?
- Mr Morgan?

15:03.527 --> 15:06.717
Yes, ma'am. My name is Pray, Moses Pray,

15:06.822 --> 15:08.552
Kansas Bible Company. He'll know.

15:08.657 --> 15:11.639
Oh, I'm sorry. Mr Morgan has passed on.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.183
Oh, ma'am, I'm... I just...

15:14.288 --> 15:15.392
I don't know what to say.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.353
Uh, what was it you
were seeing him about?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.563
- Well, he ordered this here bible from...
- Bible?

15:19.668 --> 15:21.106
Rudolph ordered a bible?

15:21.211 --> 15:23.442
Yeah, he ordered this here deluxe edition
with the lady's name in the corner.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.027
Lady's name?

15:25.132 --> 15:27.696
Oh, I expect some special gift
for a family friend.

15:27.801 --> 15:28.989
But under the circumstances,

15:29.094 --> 15:31.241
I'll just give you back
Mr Morgan's dollar deposit,

15:31.347 --> 15:33.285
and there won't be
no further obligation.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.830
Ma'am, I just don't know how to put
into words the sense of sorrow that I feel.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.833
What, what...
what name is in the corner?

15:39.939 --> 15:44.213
I don't really know what name
Mr Morgan had put in the corner, ma'am.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.422
Let's see, now.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.841
It's here somewhere. I've got it. Uh...

15:47.947 --> 15:49.134
Here it is.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.844
- Pearl...
- Pearl.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.262
I'm Pearl.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.641
Well, he must have got
this here good book for you, ma'am.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.018
Yes. Yes, he bought it for me.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.270
Of course, now,
you're not obliged to take it.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.897
Of course I'll take it.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.732
There's just one thing. You see, I...

16:03.837 --> 16:05.859
I told him that I could sell him
a cheaper bible,

16:05.965 --> 16:09.822
but no, naturally he wanted the best,
the best, of course, being the deluxe edition

16:09.927 --> 16:12.324
with the lady's name printed
in child-in-the-manger gold letters.

16:12.429 --> 16:13.742
Oh, he would.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.829
Bringing a balance due of, uh...
$8.00? $8.00.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.372
$8.00?

16:18.477 --> 16:21.417
Well, that's, uh, $8.00
minus the dollar deposit,

16:21.522 --> 16:23.335
making it $7.00.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.837
Um, I'll go get my purse.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.840
- Well, you're not obliged to take it, now.
- Of course I'm obliged!

16:27.945 --> 16:30.592
He ordered the deluxe!

16:32.366 --> 16:35.264
'But cold or no cold, it's good
to be back in old Manhattan.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.183
'Well, tell me, Jack, you've been
in town now since Thursday.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.894
- 'What have you been doing with yourself?'
- 'Oh, I've had a lot of fun, Don.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.439
'I saw some shows,
went to a couple of nightclubs,

16:43.544 --> 16:47.276
'and last night, I was invited over
to Fred Allen's apartment for dinner.'

16:47.381 --> 16:50.112
- 'Oh, Fred Allen, eh?'
- 'Yeah, he and I are pretty good friends now.'

16:50.217 --> 16:53.365
'Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Has Fred got a nice apartment?'

16:53.470 --> 16:55.159
'Oh, how could I tell, Don,

16:55.264 --> 16:58.849
'with all that laundry
hanging in the living room?'

17:01.603 --> 17:03.208
Ain't you gonna go to sleep?

17:03.814 --> 17:05.794
Don't you want to hear Jack Benny?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.755
No.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.839
'I don't want to sound catty...'

17:42.311 --> 17:46.126
You're too young to smoke.
You're going to set this whole place on fire.

18:10.297 --> 18:15.072
I now owe you $103.72.

18:16.303 --> 18:19.076
Seventy-four.

18:19.181 --> 18:23.038
<i>I always knew</i>

18:23.143 --> 18:25.249
<i>Someday I'd accompany you</i>

18:25.354 --> 18:29.419
<i>Along Flirtation Walk</i>

18:29.525 --> 18:31.672
<i>A dream foretold</i>

18:31.777 --> 18:33.841
<i>A story that you would unfold</i>

18:33.946 --> 18:39.221
<i>That lives forever and never grows old</i>

18:39.326 --> 18:41.348
<i>I always felt</i>

18:41.453 --> 18:43.642
<i>That your little heart would melt</i>

18:43.747 --> 18:45.269
<i>Along Flirtation Walk...</i>

18:45.374 --> 18:48.063
Frank D. Roosevelt said
we're all feeling a lot better.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.857
He did, did he?

18:50.504 --> 18:53.610
Made me feel good when he said that.
Better than I've felt in a long time.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.155
Bet old Frank sure does wish he was 21.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.577
You don't like me, do you?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.581
No, I don't like you.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.797
Yes?

19:13.902 --> 19:16.717
Afternoon, ma'am. I was wondering
if Mr Bates might be at home.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.845
Mr Bates is dead.
He died over a week ago.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.430
Oh, you mean he passed over, ma'am?

19:21.535 --> 19:24.057
Why, I was just talking to him
not less than a month ago.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.809
- What was it you wanted?
- Well...

19:25.914 --> 19:28.312
My name is Pray, Kansas Bible Company.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.439
I'm just here to deliver this bible
that Mr Bates ordered.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.690
Bible?

19:31.795 --> 19:33.650
Who is it? What's the trouble?

19:33.755 --> 19:37.154
Something about Benjamin buying a bible.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.114
Bible? What kind of bible?

19:39.219 --> 19:42.117
He said he talked to Benjamin,
less than a month ago.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.870
Well, I'm... I'm not exactly sure
of the dates, ma'am.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.830
Well, I don't see how.

19:46.935 --> 19:50.459
Benjamin didn't go nowheres near that shop
for more than a month before he died.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.253
Well, I may be a little
mixed up on the dates.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.422
What company you say you're from?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.799
The Kansas Bible Company,
out of Wichita.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.509
Kansas Bible Company?

19:59.615 --> 20:01.553
I ain't never heard of
no Kansas Bible Company.

20:01.658 --> 20:02.888
Daddy...

20:02.993 --> 20:06.808
Can't we go now? I want to get to church
and pray for Mama.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.271
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure we can, honey.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.023
Daddy was just fixin' to leave.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.943
This here is my little girl.
It's just the two of us now.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.987
- My Mama's gone to the Lord.
- Oh, so has poor Mr Bates, honey.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.073
I'll just, uh, give you back
his dollar deposit,

20:21.178 --> 20:23.533
and you let us know if
there's anything we can do.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.411
Hold on, there. Wait one damn minute.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.707
He actually done ordered a bible, huh?

20:30.812 --> 20:33.877
Uh, he sure did. Here it is, right here
in gold for somebody named "Marie".

20:33.982 --> 20:37.881
- That's her. She's Marie.
- Oh, she sure did mean a lot to him.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.425
He especially had me get
the deluxe edition.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.552
- How much to keep this here book?
- Oh, well, that one is the...

20:42.658 --> 20:44.096
It's the $12 one, Daddy.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.931
- $12?
- $12?

20:46.036 --> 20:48.475
Uh, yeah, well, honey, we have
to have a little goodness in our hearts,

20:48.580 --> 20:51.061
- I mean, considering the circumstances.
- Never mind the circumstances.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.815
And if it'll make that woman happy,
I'll take it.

21:07.307 --> 21:11.331
You owe me $85.74.

21:17.234 --> 21:20.466
'I mean, we're going
to Washington on the QT.

21:21.571 --> 21:25.739
'Molly, she says we can't go on the QT,
we've got to take the Pennsylvania.

21:26.702 --> 21:27.931
'Hey, I'd better get going.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.725
'Hey, Molly, where's my suitcase?
Do you know?'

21:29.830 --> 21:31.935
'Uh, I'm sure I don't know, McGee.
You had it last night.'

21:32.040 --> 21:34.354
'Oh, I know where it is.
It's right here in the hall...'

21:34.459 --> 21:36.523
He's going to open the closet!

21:44.219 --> 21:46.867
Now he's going to say how he's got to
straighten the closet out!

21:46.972 --> 21:49.494
'Got to straighten out that
closet one of these days.'

21:50.851 --> 21:52.456
How'd you like to do
a little business with me?

21:53.478 --> 21:55.125
You mean instead of paying me back?

21:55.230 --> 21:57.712
Now, don't get nervous. I'll pay you back.
I'm just saying, while we're heading east,

21:57.812 --> 22:00.005
how'd you like to do a little business
together, that's all?

22:02.904 --> 22:05.135
Well, you're looking at me
like I'm out to cheat you or something.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.512
I am offering you a business proposition.
Take it or leave it.

22:07.617 --> 22:10.891
And turn off that radio! You're like
to drive us all deaf with that radio.

22:12.789 --> 22:15.604
'...in an average way, of course.'

22:21.381 --> 22:23.695
OK, I want you to remember one thing:

22:23.800 --> 22:25.238
I decide on the price.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.367
Maybe you don't know French, but there's
something in this world called "fine-esse".

22:28.472 --> 22:30.452
$12! I never sold no bible for $12.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.704
That man was a law officer.
You could've had me put me in jail.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.623
We got it, didn't we?

22:35.395 --> 22:38.293
I don't care if we got it.
Don't you go making the decisions.

22:38.398 --> 22:42.464
I make the decisions. All you got
to do is look like a pretty little girl.

22:47.407 --> 22:50.514
You ain't got something like a ribbon
in that cigar box, do you?

22:50.619 --> 22:54.518
I got my mum's kimono in my suitcase,
Chinamen with umbrellas.

22:56.249 --> 22:58.105
That ain't quite what I had in mind.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.282
You look real nice in that ribbon.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.701
First off, I didn't know
was she a boy or a girl?

23:11.807 --> 23:13.161
I'm a girl.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.831
Well, it makes all the difference.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.875
Ain't she got a sweet
little face, somehow.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.795
Well, seeing how I just got paid today,
we'll take a ribbon in each colour.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.171
How much that going to set me back?

23:23.276 --> 23:25.340
Well, that'll be 15 cents.

23:25.445 --> 23:29.136
Bought my grandchildren
ribbons just like this last holiday time.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.555
Grandchildren? I don't believe it.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.474
- You break a five?
- Well, you can believe it, all right.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.726
I'm just as old as I look.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.937
Well, now, here you be.

23:39.042 --> 23:43.316
That's one, two, three, four, five.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.402
This old wallet of mine
is about to bust its sides.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.988
I'll give you five ones back,
you give me that $5 bill.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.656
How many grandchildren
you got altogether?

23:49.761 --> 23:53.326
Well, I got two little granddaughters,
a nine-year-old, a ten-year-old,

23:53.432 --> 23:55.996
two grandsons near 16,

23:56.101 --> 23:58.874
and I got a grandson 35 years old.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.792
Come on, you're pulling my leg.

24:00.897 --> 24:04.504
Why don't you just give me a $10 bill?
Here's the $5, and five ones, there.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.339
That way I won't be so quick
to see it break apart.

24:06.445 --> 24:10.135
- Six children, huh? My, my, my...
- I've got a daughter, 51.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.137
Oh, now, I don't mean
to be handing you no line,

24:12.242 --> 24:16.070
but that's just pretty hard to believe
you got a 51-year-old child.

24:16.170 --> 24:17.559
You can believe it, all right.

24:17.664 --> 24:20.979
Well, I'm afraid I'd have to see it
to believe it. Much obliged.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.483
- See you again.
- Y'all come back!

24:37.934 --> 24:42.501
That just don't seem quite right...
somehow.

24:48.724 --> 24:51.343
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Mr Stanley, ma'am.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.886
Mr Stanley's dead.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.056
Oh, well, I'm looking for
Mr Warren M. Stanley, ma'am.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.141
Warren's passed on, sir.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.392
Oh, that's hard to believe.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.728
I was just talking to Warren
not more than two weeks back.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.563
He ordered this here bible from me.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.941
Warren spent money on a bible?

25:06.046 --> 25:08.401
Yes, ma'am, with the name Elvira
in the corner.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.946
Why would Warren spend money on a bible?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.948
He took fast to the idea, ma'am.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.908
Only thing is, he left a balance due of,

25:15.013 --> 25:16.952
well, let's see,
not counting the dollar deposit...

25:17.057 --> 25:19.454
Daddy, this one's already paid for.

25:20.685 --> 25:23.959
Mr Stanley paid for the whole thing,
don't you remember?

25:37.911 --> 25:39.933
Afternoon, ma'am. Mr Huff at home?

25:40.038 --> 25:42.769
Mr Huff passed away,
young man, a week ago.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.814
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I was just talking to
Mr Huff not more than a month ago.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.190
What was it you wanted?

25:47.295 --> 25:50.527
Oh, well, my name is Pray,
Kansas Bible Company.

25:50.632 --> 25:53.113
Mr Huff ordered this bible
as a gift for someone named Edna.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.115
Oh, that's my name.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.472
You don't have to take it
if you don't want to.

25:56.572 --> 25:58.929
I'll just give you back
Amos's dollar deposit and then...

25:59.029 --> 26:01.371
Of course I want to keep it.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.207
He bought me a bible.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.501
Yes, ma'am. Now, I told Amos
I could sell him a cheaper one,

26:06.606 --> 26:08.753
but no, naturally, he wanted the best,

26:08.858 --> 26:11.131
the best, of course,
being the deluxe edition

26:11.236 --> 26:13.466
with the name printed
in child-in-the-manger gold letters,

26:13.572 --> 26:16.177
- bringing up a balance due of...
- ...of $24!

26:16.283 --> 26:18.555
$24. I'll get my purse.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.307
What's your name, honey?

26:20.412 --> 26:23.435
- Addie.
- Addie. What a sweet little name.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.686
Addie Pray, ma'am.

26:24.791 --> 26:28.189
Well, Addie Pray,
I'm going to give you $24,

26:28.295 --> 26:31.818
and an extra $5
for just coming to my door.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.654
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

26:44.936 --> 26:48.585
<i>Keep your sunny side up, up</i>

26:48.690 --> 26:51.713
<i>Hide the side that gets blue...</i>

27:06.458 --> 27:08.813
- Moze, let's give him some money.
- No.

27:08.918 --> 27:12.359
Just a little bit. We got $305.16.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.319
Whole 'nother business giving it away.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.863
- It's bad enough you give away bibles.
- But they're poorly.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.740
The whole country's poorly,
I told you before.

27:18.845 --> 27:21.034
But Frank D. Roosevelt says
we got to look out for one another.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.577
I don't care about Frank D. Roosevelt.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.204
- But he says it.
- That so?

27:24.309 --> 27:27.123
Why don't you ask Frank D. Roosevelt
what he thinks about taking care of himself?

27:27.228 --> 27:28.625
You think he don't eat off silver trays?

27:28.730 --> 27:31.503
He could eat off table tops like the rest
of us, but he don't. You know why?

27:31.608 --> 27:33.421
Because that would make him look common.

27:33.526 --> 27:36.091
And besides, Frank D. Roosevelt
ain't running this thing - I'm running it!

27:36.196 --> 27:38.343
So don't you make up no rules
about what we're going to give away.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.845
It's my money too, you know.
$200 belong to me,

27:40.950 --> 27:42.472
- and don't you forget that.
- You want it?

27:42.577 --> 27:45.100
Well, just put my share in my pocket,
and I'll take you to a train station.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.143
How do you like that?

27:49.084 --> 27:51.314
Get the map.
Find out where the nearest depot is.

27:51.419 --> 27:52.857
Nothing but trouble, anyway.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.818
First you charge too much,
then you want to give it away.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.153
- Where are we now?
- We just left Plainville.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.239
$12 for a bible, then it's up to $24.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.616
If I stay with you,
I'll spend the rest of my life in jail.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.035
There's a depot in Lincoln.
You can take me to Lincoln.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.245
You bet I will!

28:05.350 --> 28:06.871
- Where's Lincoln?
- Clear over there.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.915
Oh, boy, you think
I'm going to take you clear over there

28:09.020 --> 28:10.208
just to get you to some depot?

28:10.313 --> 28:12.168
Then keep going east.
We'll hit one in Sylvan Grove.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.879
- Where's Sylvan Grove?
- Right here.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.464
Well, that'll take us
down through Lucas.

28:16.569 --> 28:18.383
We got to go through something
to get to Sylvan Grove.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.760
I'm not complaining. I'm just saying
that'll take you through Lucas.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.388
You got to go through Paradox and Waldo
and Lorraine and Lucas

28:23.493 --> 28:24.848
if you want to get to Sylvan Grove.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.058
Those are pretty good towns in there.
We could do some business in there.

28:27.163 --> 28:29.352
Well, it won't matter much.
We're near out of bibles anyway.

28:29.457 --> 28:32.105
What do you mean, we're out of bibles?
Why didn't you tell me we're out of bibles?

28:32.210 --> 28:33.565
You look in the box too, don't you?

28:33.670 --> 28:36.317
- Well, you've got an excuse for everything.
- 'Cause you blame me for everything.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.778
If we were running out of bibles,
you should have told me.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.114
- We're running out of bibles!
- Well, then we got to get new ones!

28:41.219 --> 28:43.658
- Then let's get new ones!
- We can pick some up in Great Bend.

28:43.763 --> 28:47.412
- Great Bend's the other way.
- Well, we gotta have bibles, don't we?

28:47.517 --> 28:50.790
Let's see, now, we can veer down to Lucas,
and we'll veer over to Wilson.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.917
Veer off to Lorraine and Bushton.

28:53.022 --> 28:55.503
And we could veer off to Hoisington.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.798
We'll just have to keep on veering,
that's all.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.345
- I'm getting hungry. You getting hungry?
- Uh-huh.

29:27.640 --> 29:32.165
<i>Just one more chance</i>

29:33.062 --> 29:36.795
<i>To prove it's you alone I care for</i>

29:37.817 --> 29:41.365
<i>Each night I say a little prayer for...</i>

29:42.989 --> 29:44.469
You sweet thing.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.179
Don't you tell me that. Ooh!

29:46.284 --> 29:49.390
Sometimes I just don't know,
with all the old doodly-doo.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.768
Doodly-doo, doodly-doo.

29:52.624 --> 29:56.064
OK, now, you go on back, now.
I'll see you another time.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.942
- Don't send me back.
- Oh, you got to go on back.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.194
- I'll see you another time, I promise.
- I want to go in your place.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.862
No, no.

30:04.594 --> 30:08.451
You trying to keep secrets from me?
You got diamonds and rubies in there?

30:08.556 --> 30:10.411
Go on, go on.

30:10.517 --> 30:13.039
Oh, Fido... Night-night, old Fido.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.124
- Woof-woof.
- Woof-woof.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.421
Woof-woof.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.883
<i>Still I'm holding on awhile</i>

30:23.988 --> 30:29.389
<i>You'll give me just one more word</i>

33:06.609 --> 33:08.589
There it is.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.302
- Much obliged.
- Thank you, sir.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.016
All right, boy, you're next.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.852
I ain't a boy.

33:24.377 --> 33:27.525
- Aw, don't let it bother you.
- It ain't funny.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.610
No reason to get that sore.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.905
- He called me a boy, didn't he?
- He just got mixed up, that's all.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.949
He did not.
He looked me straight in the eye.

33:35.054 --> 33:39.579
Yeah, well, I'm looking you straight
in the eye, and I think you're beautiful.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.581
- Oh, you're just saying that.
- Would I make that up?

33:41.686 --> 33:44.542
You're as beautiful as your mama, and she
put all the flowers in the world to shame.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.670
You know, they wouldn't even let her come
to Holland for fear she'd droop the tulips,

33:47.775 --> 33:49.630
and you got all the good looks
she ever had.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.674
Then how come that man called me a boy?

33:51.779 --> 33:53.676
I don't know, maybe it's...

33:53.781 --> 33:55.928
Maybe it's 'cause of what you got on,
or something.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.264
What's wrong with what I got on?

33:58.369 --> 34:01.934
Oh, nothing wrong with it, just...
don't exactly make you look feminine.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.063
Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea
we get you fixed up a little bit,

34:05.168 --> 34:08.149
get you a new dress,
a fancy new hat, or something.

34:08.254 --> 34:11.319
Come to think of it,
it wouldn't exactly hurt business, either.

34:11.424 --> 34:13.654
You really think I'm
as pretty as my mama?

34:13.760 --> 34:15.406
Of course I do.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.493
- How much money we got in the box?
- $405.16.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.827
Give me a $20.

34:19.931 --> 34:22.371
- What for?
- Give me a $20!

34:25.353 --> 34:27.126
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

34:27.231 --> 34:28.960
We're going to get us
some fancy new outfits

34:29.067 --> 34:30.630
with this money you got
from your Aunt Helen.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.257
- I don't have no Aunt Helen.
- Oh, sure you do, honey.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.467
Come on, let me explain it to you.

34:37.658 --> 34:38.679
Yes, sir?

34:38.784 --> 34:41.641
I'd like an Ipana toothpaste
and a pack of Sen-Sen.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.476
- Uh, twenty and five.
- Twenty-five.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.103
- Yes, sir.
- Here you go.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.237
75 makes one,

34:54.342 --> 34:56.114
four makes five, and 15 makes 20.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.491
Thank you very much. I don't need a bag.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.546
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Bye now.

35:12.276 --> 35:13.422
Hello. How much is this?

35:13.528 --> 35:15.091
That'll be 35 cents.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.468
65 cents makes a dollar.
Thank you very much.

35:17.573 --> 35:18.761
Thank you.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.096
Yes?

35:20.201 --> 35:22.974
May I have a bottle
of purple toilet water, please?

35:23.788 --> 35:26.394
That'll be 25 cents.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.321
There you go.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.413
Lady, you made a mistake.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.624
Huh? I give you $4.75.

35:48.729 --> 35:50.626
But I gave you a $20 bill.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.628
Uh-uh. You give me a $5.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.922
No, ma'am, it was a $20 bill.

35:55.653 --> 35:59.218
You give me a $5, and I give you $4.75.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.514
It was a $20 bill.

36:06.706 --> 36:09.061
Got no $20s in with no $5s.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.105
What's all the turmoil?
What's going on here?

36:11.210 --> 36:13.858
This little girl give me a $5 bill,
and I give her change.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.235
I gave her a $20 bill - I know I did.

36:16.340 --> 36:19.197
It was a birthday present
from my Aunt Helen in Wichita,

36:19.302 --> 36:21.490
and she wrote "Happy Birthday, Addie"
on the end of it.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.659
You just go look and see.

36:25.725 --> 36:26.954
That's it right there!

36:27.059 --> 36:30.416
That's my $20 bill I got
from my Aunt Helen in Wichita.

36:30.521 --> 36:33.002
- Give the child her $20 bill.
- I'm giving it.

36:33.649 --> 36:35.922
- Give the child her $20 bill, Miss Brownwell.
- Yes, sir.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.174
- And give her a piece of candy.
- Yes, sir.

36:38.279 --> 36:41.844
- And pay attention to things, Miss Brownwell.
- Yes, sir.

36:46.412 --> 36:49.393
Come on in, get your cotton candy.

36:49.498 --> 36:52.772
Sweetheart, Cotton Candy.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.234
- Five cents.
- Do you have change for this five?

36:56.339 --> 36:58.069
There you are, little girl.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.904
Cotton candy, get your cotton candy.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.240
Mister, this purse is sure full.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.200
If you give me the five back,
I'll give you five ones.

37:04.305 --> 37:07.161
Cotton candy,
get your cotton candy right here.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.288
Mister, if you got a ten dollar bill

37:09.393 --> 37:11.666
I'll give you the five back
with the five ones you have.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.542
Would you give me a ten dollar bill?

37:15.149 --> 37:18.005
There, now don't bother me anymore,
you understand?

37:18.110 --> 37:19.382
Cotton candy!

37:19.487 --> 37:22.051
Step up and get your cotton candy.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.220
Come and get it.

37:37.338 --> 37:40.111
Get your tickets.
Only one fourth of a dollar.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.363
The show goes on in five minutes.

37:43.219 --> 37:46.701
Six unusual little ladies
unveiling the secrets of passion.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.536
Found only a few years back

37:48.641 --> 37:51.622
in the actual Egyptian
tomb of Queen Nefereti.

37:51.727 --> 37:55.918
And featuring the luscious
Miss Trixie Delight.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.714
- I had my photo took, Moze.
- You did, huh? Ain't that fine.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.549
Moze, can you come have
your photo took with me?

38:01.654 --> 38:03.592
- Can't right now, sweetheart.
- Only take a minute.

38:03.698 --> 38:06.178
- Not now, you hear me?
- But it's almost down here tonight.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.014
- It wouldn't be here after...
- I can't help that.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.391
- Now excuse me, you understand?
- How many times you going to see it?

38:10.496 --> 38:12.476
As many times as I like,
that's how many times.

38:12.581 --> 38:14.979
- You seen it half a dozen times.
- And I might see it a half dozen more.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.647
Now why don't you go play bingo
or something?

38:16.752 --> 38:18.065
I don't want to play bingo.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.276
Well, then why don't you go write
another love note to St. Roosevelt?

38:20.381 --> 38:21.485
Maybe I will.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.696
And stop standing around here
checking on me. You don't have to worry.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.490
I ain't about to leave some poor little child
stranded in the middle of nowhere.

38:26.595 --> 38:29.201
I got scruples, too, you know.
You know what that is, "scruples"?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.703
No, I don't know what it is,

38:30.808 --> 38:33.664
but if you got them, I sure bet
they belong to somebody else.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.502
And his name ain't Frank, it's Franklin.

38:51.954 --> 38:54.727
Hey there, my little turtle-dee.
I wondered where you got to.

38:54.832 --> 38:55.853
Where's your pa?

38:55.958 --> 38:57.813
- Is my picture ready?
- Sure, it's...

38:57.918 --> 38:59.148
Excuse me, folks, come right back.

38:59.253 --> 39:01.317
Sit back in the moon there,
I'll be right with you.

39:01.422 --> 39:02.651
Let's see.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.153
Here it is, here.

39:06.218 --> 39:08.949
Hey, now, I thought you were
gonna sit in the moon with your pa.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.826
He ain't my pa.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.996
Hi, folks. Get ready.

39:14.101 --> 39:15.873
Smile. Hold it.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.041
Hold it.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.667
Beautiful.

39:35.122 --> 39:37.228
I don't want you smoking
in the car tomorrow.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.732
- What?
- I didn't say nothing. I'm just listening to you.

39:41.837 --> 39:44.068
Well, there are going to be
a couple extra people riding with us,

39:44.173 --> 39:45.903
and this particular person
don't like cigarette smoke.

39:46.008 --> 39:47.488
- What extra person?
- What?

39:47.593 --> 39:49.115
I said "what extra person"?

39:49.220 --> 39:51.283
A lady and her maid.
I'm giving them a ride to Topeka.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.701
I didn't know we was going to Topeka.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.995
Well, that's because
you don't know everything.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.789
What's the lady's name?

39:57.311 --> 39:59.917
Miss Delight. Miss Trixie Delight.

40:01.273 --> 40:03.045
She's a real lady.
She comes from a good family.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.505
I'm just giving her a ride, that's all.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.925
Well, that's what you're always talking
about, ain't it? Helping other people out.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.236
Now don't you drop nothing, Imogene.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.071
You take care of those breakables,
understand?

40:29.176 --> 40:30.531
Yes, Miss Trixie.

40:31.637 --> 40:34.076
Morning. Car is right over here.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.002
You better ride in the backseat a while.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.228
And then I danced in Tuscaloosa.

41:01.333 --> 41:04.523
And the mayor was there,
and he just said the nicest things about me.

41:04.628 --> 41:06.692
The newspaper ran
a whole big photo on me.

41:06.797 --> 41:10.362
I got a scrap book telling stories on me
from towns all over.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.592
Tell him 'bout the time that man

41:11.692 --> 41:14.259
tried to crack your head open
with the bottle, Miss Trixie.

41:14.847 --> 41:18.162
Why, Imogene, you silly old thing.
You know that's not true.

41:18.267 --> 41:20.956
That old country boy wasn't going to hit me
over the head with no bottle.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.416
He was just horsing around.

41:22.521 --> 41:25.461
Ask me real nice, maybe I'll tell you
about that sometime.

41:25.566 --> 41:28.923
Well, tell him about the time you almost got
thrown in jail, Miss Trixie.

41:39.705 --> 41:41.852
I just don't understand it, Daddy,

41:41.957 --> 41:45.272
but this little baby has to go
winky-tinky all the time.

41:45.377 --> 41:47.900
Well, don't you worry none.
We'll just plan on stopping here for dinner.

41:48.005 --> 41:50.694
But we just stopped for her
to winky-tink at lunch.

41:50.799 --> 41:53.280
That's right, and now
we're stopping for dinner.

41:53.385 --> 41:55.699
- Come on.
- I ain't hungry.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.254
- Want one?
- OK.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.594
- How old are you?
- I don't know, 15. Why?

42:15.699 --> 42:17.555
Just asking, that's all.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.431
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.767
Well, you got to be from somewhere.

42:21.872 --> 42:23.352
Down by Troy, I guess.

42:23.457 --> 42:25.938
How long have you worked for her?

42:26.043 --> 42:27.523
Ain't kept count.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.817
A year, maybe. How old you be?

42:30.381 --> 42:31.569
Nine.

42:31.674 --> 42:33.988
She really do all that dancing?

42:34.093 --> 42:36.532
Well, if you want to call it "dancing".

42:36.637 --> 42:40.244
All she do is wag her hips
and shake her old behind a little.

42:40.349 --> 42:42.705
How come she'd leave
that job back there?

42:42.810 --> 42:46.000
'Cause the boss man tried to make her
put out for his friends.

42:46.105 --> 42:48.460
And she don't believe
in putting out for free.

42:48.566 --> 42:49.878
She put out much?

42:49.984 --> 42:51.630
Just like a gum machine.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.258
You drop something in
and she'll put something out.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.010
How much she charge?

42:56.115 --> 42:57.886
Most she can get.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.097
But she always asks for $5.00.

43:00.202 --> 43:01.932
She ain't putting out
for your pa, though.

43:02.955 --> 43:05.894
Says she's going to wait and get all she can
before she put out for him.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.896
He tell her he was my pa?

43:08.002 --> 43:09.898
Well, not exactly.

43:10.004 --> 43:12.818
I heard him mumbling something
like he didn't want to talk about it.

43:12.923 --> 43:15.154
- Ain't he?
- I'm with him, ain't I?

43:16.176 --> 43:18.032
And how do you come to be with her?

43:18.137 --> 43:20.701
'Cause she promised to give me
$4.00 every week.

43:20.806 --> 43:22.661
She ain't gave me nothing.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.788
'Cept a nickel or dime, sometimes.

43:24.893 --> 43:27.082
- Why don't you quit?
- Quit?

43:27.187 --> 43:29.043
How am I going to quit?

43:29.148 --> 43:30.753
And what if I do quit?

43:30.858 --> 43:32.921
Ain't got no money to get home to Mum.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.381
And what if I do get home?

43:34.486 --> 43:36.508
They got hard times as it is.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.428
My mama say,
"You go work for a white lady,

43:39.533 --> 43:41.764
"she'll take good care of you."

43:41.869 --> 43:43.932
- You want to know what I think?
- Yeah.

43:44.038 --> 43:46.018
You know the little white speck
on top of chicken doo-doo?

43:46.123 --> 43:47.144
Yeah.

43:47.249 --> 43:49.647
Well, that's the kind of white
I think Miss Trixie is.

43:49.752 --> 43:53.609
She's just like that little white speck
on top of old chicken shit.

43:57.760 --> 44:02.534
Oh, I just love it, love it, love it.
All this white.

44:02.640 --> 44:06.955
It is absolutely the proper thing
for my particular kind of appearance.

44:07.061 --> 44:09.208
You know, it wouldn't be bad
for you to have a new dress, too.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.877
The right kind of dress makes
all the difference in the face.

44:11.982 --> 44:15.089
Especially since you got
the right kind of bone structure.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.799
Oh...

44:16.904 --> 44:18.634
Oh, my, oh, my.

44:18.739 --> 44:23.138
Daddy, but wouldn't you look handsome sitting
behind the wheel of a thing like that?

44:23.243 --> 44:25.391
'Course, you know, everything
is in the bone structure.

44:25.496 --> 44:29.103
You know, a person can tell his whole life
on what his bone structure is.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.313
I tried pushing her out
a window once in Little Rock.

44:32.586 --> 44:33.816
Oh...

44:33.921 --> 44:36.235
Oh, I think there's bugs all over the...

44:36.340 --> 44:38.821
I just hope there's
no snakes around here.

44:38.926 --> 44:41.031
You know, I think we ought to go now.

44:42.137 --> 44:43.701
Thank you so much.

44:43.806 --> 44:45.661
Now hurry... oh.

44:47.497 --> 44:49.748
Come on, hurry up.
Get those things in there, now.

44:49.853 --> 44:51.709
Don't break anything, either.

44:56.902 --> 44:57.923
Let's go.

44:58.028 --> 45:00.426
Hurry up, doctor,
this baby's got to go winky-tinky.

45:00.531 --> 45:01.802
Don't worry.

45:02.658 --> 45:04.221
Hey!

45:08.330 --> 45:09.852
Come on, we're ready.

45:10.457 --> 45:12.646
- Come on, now.
- I ain't ready.

45:12.751 --> 45:15.357
Well, you don't look real busy with nothing,
so you just come on down.

45:15.462 --> 45:16.984
I ain't coming.

45:17.089 --> 45:20.070
- Now you listen here, child.
- No, I won't listen here.

45:20.175 --> 45:21.405
What the heck's up with you, then?

45:21.510 --> 45:23.490
I want to sit in front.

45:23.595 --> 45:25.534
And how come we ain't working no more?

45:25.639 --> 45:28.036
'Cause we're on vacation, that's why.

45:28.142 --> 45:31.415
And Miss Delight and me are sitting in front
because we are two grown-ups,

45:31.520 --> 45:33.667
and that's where grown-ups
do the sitting.

45:33.772 --> 45:35.502
And little children
do not tell grown-ups

45:35.607 --> 45:37.337
what to do with their lives,
you understand that?

45:37.443 --> 45:41.383
Well, she ain't my grown-up, and I ain't
planning no more to sit in the back.

45:41.488 --> 45:42.718
Not for no cow.

45:42.823 --> 45:44.344
Will you keep your voice down?

45:44.450 --> 45:46.889
And Miss Delight ain't no cow.
She's a proper woman.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.432
She has a high school diploma,

45:48.537 --> 45:51.769
and right now she's gotta go to the bathroom,
so you just get on down to the car.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.812
She always has to go to the bathroom.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.356
She must have a bladder
the size of a peanut.

45:56.462 --> 45:59.610
Well, I ain't getting back in that car.
Not till she gets out of it.

46:33.415 --> 46:36.647
Hey, what's up, kiddo?
Daddy says you're wearing a sad face.

46:36.752 --> 46:38.315
Ain't good to have a sad face.

46:38.420 --> 46:41.276
Hey, how would you like a colouring book?
Would you like that?

46:41.381 --> 46:42.861
You like Mickey the Mouse?

46:42.966 --> 46:44.780
Oh, son of a bitch!

46:45.344 --> 46:47.783
Ooh... oh.

46:48.931 --> 46:52.162
Now come on down to the car
and let's all be friends.

46:52.267 --> 46:55.040
You see me smile? Come on,
let's see you smile like Aunt Trixie.

46:55.145 --> 46:56.250
Now, come on!

46:56.355 --> 46:58.710
Come on down to the car
with mademoiselle.

47:03.779 --> 47:06.134
Kiddo, I understand how you feel.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.136
Well, you don't have to worry.

47:08.242 --> 47:11.056
One of these days, you're going to be
just as pretty as mademoiselle,

47:11.161 --> 47:12.933
maybe prettier.

47:13.038 --> 47:15.060
You already got bone structure.

47:15.165 --> 47:17.563
When I was your age,
I didn't have no bone structure.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.606
Took me years to get bone structure.

47:19.711 --> 47:22.442
And don't think bone structure's
not important.

47:22.548 --> 47:25.112
Nobody started to call me mademoiselle
till I was 17

47:25.217 --> 47:27.614
and getting a little bone structure.

47:27.719 --> 47:29.867
When I was your age,
I was skinnier than a pole.

47:29.972 --> 47:32.035
I never thought
I'd have nothing up here.

47:32.140 --> 47:34.538
You're going to have them up there, too.

47:35.686 --> 47:38.917
Look, I'll tell you what.
Want me to show you how to use cosmetics?

47:40.399 --> 47:43.964
Look, I'll let you put on my earrings.
You can see how pretty you're going to be.

47:44.903 --> 47:47.092
And I'll show you how to
make up your eyes.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.886
And your lips.

47:48.991 --> 47:51.263
And I'll see to it you get
a little bra or something.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.849
But right now you're gonna
pick your little ass up,

47:53.954 --> 47:56.184
you're gonna drop it in the backseat
and you're gonna cut out the crap,

47:56.290 --> 47:57.769
you understand?

48:10.095 --> 48:12.117
You're going to ruin it, ain't you?

48:13.181 --> 48:15.495
Look, I don't want to wipe you out,

48:15.601 --> 48:18.248
and I don't want you
wiping me out, you know?

48:18.353 --> 48:20.459
So, I'm going to level with you, OK?

48:21.523 --> 48:24.087
Now, you see, with me,
it's just a matter of time.

48:24.818 --> 48:28.926
I don't know why, but somehow
I just don't manage to hold on real long.

48:30.032 --> 48:32.846
So, if you wait it out a little,
it'll be over, you know?

48:34.119 --> 48:36.266
I mean, even if I want a fella,

48:36.371 --> 48:39.478
somehow or other
I manage to get it screwed up.

48:40.709 --> 48:44.816
Maybe I'll get a new pair of shoes,
nice dress, a few laughs.

48:45.839 --> 48:47.611
Times are hard.

48:49.051 --> 48:51.531
Now, if you fool around
on the hill up here,

48:51.637 --> 48:53.158
then you don't get nothing,

48:53.263 --> 48:54.618
I don't get nothing,

48:54.723 --> 48:56.328
he don't get nothing.

48:58.518 --> 49:00.374
So how 'bout it, honey?

49:00.479 --> 49:02.542
Just for a little while,

49:02.648 --> 49:05.837
let old Trixie sit up front
with her big tits.

49:16.745 --> 49:18.433
Hey, come on.

49:20.832 --> 49:22.270
We're coming, baby doll.

49:22.376 --> 49:25.107
And if you don't find me
some old gas station soon,

49:25.212 --> 49:28.235
this little old snowflake's
going to wet her pantaloons.

49:30.133 --> 49:32.656
Oh, my, I almost fell down.

49:41.061 --> 49:43.208
Yoo-hoo! Look what we got!

49:43.772 --> 49:45.252
Ain't she the sweetest little thing,

49:45.357 --> 49:47.671
and don't he look
like a prince on that wheel?

49:47.776 --> 49:49.965
Now, come on, Imogene.
Now, get everything in here.

49:50.070 --> 49:52.092
We got more room than
the whole state of Kansas.

49:52.197 --> 49:55.288
And listen to the horn.
Blow the horn, Daddy.

49:56.118 --> 49:58.432
Oh, go ahead.

49:59.454 --> 50:01.209
Do it again.

50:04.292 --> 50:06.106
Sticks his tongue into the water,

50:06.211 --> 50:08.525
and there's an alligator in the river...

50:11.758 --> 50:13.530
Very funny.

50:15.345 --> 50:17.868
This girl's sitting on the trolley,
and she reaches in her bag,

50:17.973 --> 50:20.120
and she takes out this magazine,
and she starts to read it.

50:20.225 --> 50:21.830
Well, she ain't read more than
a couple of pages.

50:21.935 --> 50:25.083
And real slow and careful now,
she takes her stockings down

50:25.188 --> 50:27.294
and takes off her shoes.

50:27.399 --> 50:30.088
Now, she turns the stockings wrong side out,
and she puts them back on.

50:30.193 --> 50:31.423
She puts her shoes back on.

50:31.528 --> 50:34.051
Well, all the passengers are watching.
They wonder what's going on.

50:34.156 --> 50:37.179
This old guy, he leans over to her,
and he asks her, he says, "What's...?

50:37.284 --> 50:40.265
"I saw you indulge in a strange procedure,
ma'am. What were you doing?"

50:40.370 --> 50:42.768
And she said, "Well, I was reading
this here magazine, you know?

50:42.873 --> 50:45.062
"And I found it to be
such hot stuff that I...

50:45.167 --> 50:48.725
"Well, I felt compelled
to turn the hose on myself."

50:51.339 --> 50:53.403
Oh, turn the hose on!

50:53.508 --> 50:55.614
When you said that, I...

51:05.312 --> 51:08.043
They wouldn't have a room
with a canopy bed, would they?

51:09.316 --> 51:11.463
You wouldn't have a room
with a canopy bed, would you?

51:11.568 --> 51:14.424
Uh, no. But I got one with a fireplace.

51:14.529 --> 51:16.384
Oh, I'd like that one, Daddy.

51:16.490 --> 51:19.179
It ain't no canopy bed,

51:19.284 --> 51:22.974
but it sure do open up
a whole new can of peas, don't it?

51:23.080 --> 51:25.143
Can of peas.

51:25.248 --> 51:27.687
- Ain't that cute?
- Huh? How's that?

51:27.793 --> 51:30.899
Come on, Imogene.
Now, help the boy with these things.

51:31.004 --> 51:34.152
Give them 234, 235, and 236.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.623
They're working
on the elevator right now,

51:36.723 --> 51:38.704
and it's the first flight up,
if you don't mind.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.867
- It's all right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

51:40.972 --> 51:43.620
- "Can of peas". Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what was that all about?

51:43.725 --> 51:45.163
Well, you know,

51:45.268 --> 51:48.083
Canopy... can of pea...
They rhyme, you know?

51:48.188 --> 51:50.669
- Oh, I see! Can of peas, canopy!
- Yeah.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.045
I get it now.

51:53.985 --> 51:56.758
I knew you'd get it
if I explained it to you.

51:56.863 --> 52:01.012
<i>Picture Henry Ford without a car</i>

52:01.118 --> 52:05.016
<i>Picture heaven's firmament
without a star</i>

52:05.122 --> 52:09.187
<i>Picture Grigsby Chrysler
without a fiddle</i>

52:09.292 --> 52:13.191
<i>Picture poor Philadelphia
without a Biddle</i>

52:13.296 --> 52:17.279
<i>Picture Central Park without a sailor</i>

52:17.384 --> 52:21.366
<i>Picture Mr Lord minus his detailer</i>

52:21.471 --> 52:24.703
<i>Mix 'em all together,
and what have you got?</i>

52:24.808 --> 52:27.664
<i>Just a picture of me without you</i>

52:55.088 --> 52:57.110
Now there's a rip in the seam
of that dress, Imogene.

52:57.215 --> 52:58.737
You get it sewed up good, you hear?

52:58.842 --> 53:01.239
- And wash these hose.
- Yes, Miss Trixie.

53:01.344 --> 53:03.617
- Got my bath ready?
- Yes, Miss Trixie.

53:03.722 --> 53:04.910
Hope the water's not too hot.

53:05.015 --> 53:06.953
You've been making that water
awful hot lately, Imogene.

53:07.058 --> 53:08.955
I knows you like it hot, Miss Trixie.

53:09.060 --> 53:10.665
Well, not that hot.

53:10.770 --> 53:14.002
Now, you go on, finish up all these things
and come back in an hour and dry me off.

53:14.107 --> 53:15.962
Yes, Miss Trixie.

53:22.490 --> 53:23.720
What you doing up there?

53:23.825 --> 53:26.223
I got us an idea. Come on.

53:26.828 --> 53:29.392
- What kind of idea?
- Come on in here, and I'll tell you.

53:29.497 --> 53:31.186
Go on.

53:33.293 --> 53:35.607
Imogene, what do you suppose
Miss Trixie would do

53:35.712 --> 53:38.193
if somebody offered her $25 to put out?

53:38.298 --> 53:39.694
Oh-wee, you crazy.

53:39.799 --> 53:42.072
For that much money,
that woman would drop her pants down

53:42.177 --> 53:44.157
- in the middle of the road.
- That's what I figured.

53:44.262 --> 53:45.367
What you got in mind?

53:45.472 --> 53:47.869
You want to get away
from Miss Trixie, don't you?

53:47.974 --> 53:50.872
Well, if you help me, I'll give you
enough money to get home to your mama.

53:50.977 --> 53:53.458
- How much money?
- $30.

53:53.563 --> 53:55.877
- When do we start?
- Tomorrow morning.

54:00.278 --> 54:01.341
Miss Trixie,

54:01.446 --> 54:04.636
you know that man down at the desk
who checked us in yesterday?

54:04.741 --> 54:06.346
Yeah, I know him. What about him?

54:06.451 --> 54:10.058
Well, he tell me, he'd pay $25
just to have a good time with you.

54:10.163 --> 54:11.309
What?

54:11.414 --> 54:13.853
Well, that little two-bit bum
nerve of that guy.

54:13.959 --> 54:16.773
$25. I bet that little John
don't make that much in a week.

54:16.878 --> 54:18.191
Where would he get 25 bucks?

54:18.296 --> 54:21.278
I don't know.
All I know is what he told me.

54:22.092 --> 54:23.989
25 bucks, huh?

54:24.094 --> 54:25.782
Sure have to see the money
to believe it.

54:37.357 --> 54:40.171
Here you go. You come back
and see us again real soon.

54:44.489 --> 54:46.344
I'll have a Juicy Fruit gum, please.

54:46.449 --> 54:49.139
Here you go, my little beauty.
Want I should chew it for you?

54:49.244 --> 54:51.266
Say, you know that redheaded lady

54:51.371 --> 54:53.643
that comes down here
named Miss Trixie Delight?

54:53.748 --> 54:55.603
Well, she thinks you're real cute.

54:55.709 --> 54:57.564
Oh, yeah? Says you and who else?

54:57.669 --> 55:00.442
No, honest. She says you're better looking
than Dick Powell.

55:00.547 --> 55:03.111
She did, eh?
Well, the lady's got good taste, don't she?

55:03.216 --> 55:05.947
- Well, just thought you'd like to know.
- Hey, just a minute.

55:08.179 --> 55:11.953
Give these here to the lady, and tell her
they're with Floyd's compliments.

55:12.559 --> 55:15.790
Oh. She'll like that.

55:15.895 --> 55:17.584
Maybe you should write her a note.

55:17.689 --> 55:20.086
- Yeah. What kind of a note?
- Oh, I don't know.

55:20.191 --> 55:23.506
I thought men always wrote ladies notes
when they send them presents.

55:23.611 --> 55:25.425
Maybe you should ask her for a date.

55:25.530 --> 55:27.093
That will sure tickle her.

55:27.198 --> 55:28.928
Yeah. Maybe I ought to.

55:29.034 --> 55:32.140
Say, she's not married up
or anything like that, is she?

55:33.455 --> 55:36.728
Of course not. She don't even have
a regular boyfriend.

55:36.833 --> 55:39.689
That man who come in here
yesterday with her is my daddy.

55:39.794 --> 55:41.858
He's her manager. She's a dancer.

55:41.963 --> 55:43.276
A dancer?

55:43.381 --> 55:45.653
You know, I figured
she was something like that.

55:45.759 --> 55:46.780
Whereabouts she dance?

55:46.885 --> 55:49.282
Oh, lots of big places. She's a star.

55:49.387 --> 55:50.867
Well, how about that!

55:51.473 --> 55:53.536
Why don't you print it?
She like men who prints.

55:53.641 --> 55:55.705
Print it, huh?

55:57.145 --> 56:00.293
"Some sweets for the sweet. Ha, ha.

56:00.398 --> 56:03.254
"Some girls say I'm a pretty
smooth dancer myself.

56:03.360 --> 56:06.257
- "How about trying me out sometime?"
- You sure this is going to work?

56:06.363 --> 56:09.260
I don't know, but we're sure
going to give it a try.

56:19.459 --> 56:21.606
Throw this in the drawer, will you?

56:22.712 --> 56:24.984
And keep your fingers crossed.

56:31.429 --> 56:33.410
- Who is it?
- It's me, Addie.

56:33.515 --> 56:35.245
Oh. What do you want?

56:35.350 --> 56:36.996
I got a message from Moze.

56:37.102 --> 56:39.666
He asked me to tell you he had
to run over to Hainesville today.

56:39.771 --> 56:41.835
He won't be back until suppertime.

56:43.108 --> 56:45.672
I think he had to get something
fixed on his car.

56:45.777 --> 56:48.591
- He'll be gone all day.
- Oh.

56:48.696 --> 56:50.802
Well... OK.

56:56.621 --> 56:58.560
OK!

57:10.552 --> 57:12.240
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

57:12.345 --> 57:14.701
- What you having?
- Waffles.

57:14.806 --> 57:16.703
I already ate. I had waffles, too.

57:16.808 --> 57:18.955
They sure are good, ain't they?

57:19.060 --> 57:21.082
They ain't bad for waffles.

57:22.814 --> 57:25.128
Mr Moze, Miss Trixie don't feel so good.

57:25.233 --> 57:27.046
She say she's going
to stay in bed today.

57:27.152 --> 57:29.090
She say she'll see you
around suppertime.

57:29.195 --> 57:31.176
She sick? Sick in bed?
I... I better go up there.

57:31.281 --> 57:33.928
Oh, she ain't real sick.
Ain't nothing to worry about.

57:34.033 --> 57:35.680
She's just having her lady's time.

57:37.287 --> 57:39.017
Oh.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.852
Well, you tell her
I'll see her this evening.

57:44.919 --> 57:47.775
Well, just wanted to say good morning.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.320
I think I'll go upstairs
and polish my shoes.

58:33.009 --> 58:36.533
- Somebody at the door, Imogene.
- Yes, Miss Trixie.

58:45.188 --> 58:46.834
It's something for you, Miss Trixie.

58:46.940 --> 58:49.546
- Oh, what is it?
- It was outside the door.

58:49.651 --> 58:51.464
What is that?

58:54.697 --> 58:56.094
Imogene, let all that go now.

58:56.199 --> 58:58.429
You can run along.
I'll call you when I need you.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.557
Yes, Miss Trixie.

59:09.587 --> 59:11.359
Well, hello, cupid.

59:11.464 --> 59:15.196
Miss Trixie wants to see you.
She says it's real important. Room 235.

59:15.301 --> 59:17.574
Oh, she does, does she? When?

59:17.679 --> 59:20.159
- Right now.
- Well, I can't get off right now.

59:20.265 --> 59:21.953
But she says it's real important.

59:22.058 --> 59:25.832
Well, you tell her I'll come up later
tonight... when the moon is full.

59:25.937 --> 59:27.458
But you can't come tonight.

59:27.564 --> 59:29.836
She won't even be here after tonight.

59:29.941 --> 59:32.714
Matter of fact,
she won't even be here after today.

59:32.819 --> 59:35.258
She won't, huh? Well...

59:35.363 --> 59:37.844
You won't be sorry.

59:38.741 --> 59:41.514
I guess I could go up for a few minutes.

59:41.619 --> 59:42.849
What's that room number again?

59:42.954 --> 59:45.852
Room 235. She's waiting for ya.

59:45.957 --> 59:49.272
OK. You tell her
I'm on my way up, sweetheart.

59:55.508 --> 59:57.822
He's coming! He's coming!

01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:13.338
- Who is it?
- Sheik of Araby.

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:18.009
Well, then, don't you look pretty?

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:19.927
Well, come on in, honey.

01:00:23.895 --> 01:00:25.892
Come on.

01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:30.146
...you don't give a girl much time.

01:00:30.251 --> 01:00:31.981
Oh, I manage to get around.

01:00:32.086 --> 01:00:34.692
Say, you're not one of these fellows
goes around babbling, are you, honey?

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:35.818
What do you mean?

01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:37.528
Well, you know,
now most of the time I don't mind,

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.947
but it's important to me right now
not to get talked about.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:42.533
Hey, now do I look like
that kind of fellow?

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.620
Say... oh, say you are a wild one,
aren't you?

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:48.623
Hold it, hold it! Now, wait a minute,
you're going to tear it!

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:50.875
Now, now, just let me slip it off.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.168
Hey, there.

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:54.420
Well, now, ain't you a show dog?

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.506
Ooh... ooh!

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:58.424
I'm going.

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:03.346
The key... Give me the key!

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:06.683
Mr Moze's going to kill that man. He's
going to kill them both, I just knows it.

01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:12.730
- Wait for me here.
- OK.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:36.587
- Moze!
- What's the trouble?

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.799
Better go up to Trixie's room
right away.

01:01:39.904 --> 01:01:41.092
Why? What? She sick?

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.802
No, she's not sick.
Just do what I tell you.

01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:45.138
And take the elevator.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.515
Don't knock. Use the key.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.785
Your daddy going
to kill that man, I reckon.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.996
I expect he cut him up pretty bad.

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.873
Moze wouldn't do a thing like that.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.500
Well, down home,
when a man come in from work,

01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:17.378
and hear a man inside house
in bed with his wife,

01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:19.547
he just walk around to the woodpile

01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:23.926
and get his double-blade axe, and go inside,
chop 'em both up to little pieces.

01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:27.138
Folks say he cut 'em up
just like kindling wood.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.111
Get your things, Addie. We're leaving.

01:02:42.216 --> 01:02:44.363
- Now?
- Right this minute.

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:06.427
I swan, I don't know why that girl
did such a thing to me.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:09.430
I'd have done almost anything
for that girl.

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:11.474
Just ain't fair.

01:03:15.249 --> 01:03:18.314
I reckon she's been...
carrying on a long time.

01:03:18.419 --> 01:03:20.775
- From the start.
- You mean, there were other men?

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.151
Lots of 'em.

01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:24.237
Well, dadblammit,
why didn't you tell me?

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:26.781
I just knew you wouldn't believe me.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.077
- I want you to promise me just one thing.
- What, Moze?

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:35.289
When you grow up,
don't you be the kind of woman

01:03:35.394 --> 01:03:37.667
who goes around deceiving men.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:40.670
- Promise me that.
- I promise, Moze.

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:03.860
<i>Oh, my love, let's take a walk</i>

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:08.906
<i>Just a little ways away</i>

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:14.829
<i>While we walk along, we'll talk</i>

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:19.876
<i>Talk about our wedding day</i>

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:25.631
<i>Only say that you'll be mine</i>

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:30.887
<i>And in our home, we'll happy be</i>

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:36.058
<i>Down beside where the waters flow</i>

01:04:37.498 --> 01:04:39.353
<i>Down on the banks...</i>

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:41.856
- Moze?
- Hmm?

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:43.316
Moze, pay attention.

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:45.610
- What's the trouble?
- I seen something peculiar.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.820
- What's that?
- That man in there.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:51.490
- What man?
- Standing by the door.

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:53.075
What's peculiar about him?

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.953
He's got a roll of money
could choke us both to death.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:59.165
Well, I'm not up to anything right now.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.376
But he's got a black book for making
notes in, and all that money,

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:05.504
and he keeps going outside
and then coming back in again.

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:07.798
- Bootlegger.
- Bootlegger?

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.300
No question about it.

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.302
You think we might do
some business with him?

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:12.929
Maybe drop a wad or something?

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:15.556
We ain't done nothing in two months,
ever since Trixie.

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.808
And we only have $212 left.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.769
Better ways of doing
business with bootleggers.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:21.020
What ways?

01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:22.813
Oh, heaps of ways.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.982
Look, he's going out again!

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:27.693
Follow him.

01:05:27.798 --> 01:05:29.570
- Should I, Moze?
- I told you, didn't I?

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:31.489
Follow him. Find out where he goes.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:35.201
<i>Thinking,
"Lord, what a deed I have done!"</i>

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.664
<i>Killed the girl I loved, you see</i>

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:45.753
<i>'Cause she would not marry me</i>

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:51.884
<i>Only say that you'll be mine</i>

01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:56.430
<i>And in our home, we'll happy be</i>

01:05:57.411 --> 01:06:02.144
<i>Down beside where the waters flow</i>

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:07.441
<i>Down on the banks of the Ohio</i>

01:06:54.218 --> 01:06:56.115
Thank you.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:05.499
<i>Big brown eyes and curly hair...</i>

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:06.792
What'd you find out?

01:07:06.897 --> 01:07:09.462
He's got a lot of bottles
he keeps in some kind of bin out back.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.922
- How big's the bin?
- About as big as our car trunk, maybe.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:14.341
- What you plan to do?
- Find out where he keeps his goods.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.053
Well, there was a little shack
out there, too, but he didn't go in it.

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:23.434
Well, honey... how about a little walk
before Daddy puts you in the bed?

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:25.580
Oh, goody.

01:07:28.502 --> 01:07:30.816
Our friend's name is Jess Hardin.
He's a bootlegger, all right.

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:32.902
Wholesales pretty near
everybody in the county.

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:36.655
His brother's some sort of a big shot, too,
but the girl couldn't tell me about him.

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:39.366
Some Romeo walked up, and I had to beat it.
Now, where is it?

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:41.869
- Right over there.
- OK, come on.

01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:49.418
OK, now, you watch the hotel.

01:07:49.523 --> 01:07:51.796
You see anybody coming, you cough real low.
I'm going inside.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.589
- It may be locked.
- Shucks, honey.

01:07:53.694 --> 01:07:56.759
Folks in the country never lock anything.
Don't you know that?

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:28.541
<i>Come sit by my side, little darling</i>

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:35.589
<i>Come lay your cool hand on my brow</i>

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:42.805
<i>Promise me that you will never</i>

01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:46.350
<i>- Be nobody's darlin' but mine</i>
- Your name Hardin?

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.769
That's right.

01:08:48.874 --> 01:08:50.312
Conrad's the name.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:53.064
Jack said I ought to look you up.

01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:54.774
Jack who?

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.653
Oh, just Jack's good enough, I reckon.

01:08:57.758 --> 01:08:59.154
Don't know no Jack.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.781
Well, maybe you ought to get acquainted.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.200
He's running the biggest
wholesale business in the state.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.161
- You selling?
- That's right.

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:07.078
Ain't interested in no shiney.

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:10.124
I ain't selling no shiney,
I only deal in bonded goods.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.876
- What kind?
- All kinds.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:14.295
I can let you have a pretty good deal
on some Three Feathers.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.671
How much?

01:09:15.776 --> 01:09:19.841
Well, it depends. You take 20 cases,
I'll let 'em go for $25 per.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:21.385
- That's too much.
- Ain't too much.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.054
You can't get it that cheap
where they sell it legal.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.764
Ain't legal here.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.892
That's all the more reason
you're getting a bargain.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.560
Give you just $20.

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:32.145
Can't do it.
Price is set down in Wichita.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.524
How long before delivery?

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.569
Oh... how's early in the morning?

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.197
You got it in the county?

01:09:41.926 --> 01:09:43.616
That's right.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:50.456
<i>My mother is dead and in heaven...</i>

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.499
Where do I pick it up?

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:53.834
<i>My daddy...</i>

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.589
- That'll do it.
- Did you leave some?

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.591
Plenty. He'll never miss it.

01:10:03.115 --> 01:10:04.303
Moze?

01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:06.639
Moze, we better get.

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.766
- Here.
- It's all filled up, I told you.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.476
Them's for me.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.145
Get going!

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.277
Hurry.

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:23.072
Get up there!

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:25.658
Now hold on.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.660
And make sure nothing spills off.

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:29.161
Well, you'd better go slow.

01:10:29.266 --> 01:10:30.829
And hurry.

01:10:34.429 --> 01:10:37.878
- Easy!
- Well, I got to turn corners, don't I?

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.260
Moze, ain't he going to miss his whisky?

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:45.678
Oh, maybe in about a week,

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:47.846
but by the time he's figured it out,
we'll be in Missouri

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:50.599
and he can't do nothing
once we're in Missouri.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.272
Come on.

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:16.292
Where is it?

01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:41.942
Scoot over!

01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:46.447
- How much you get?
- $625.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:50.316
$625, and he bought his own whisky!

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:14.433
That's $625 plus the $212
we already got.

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:17.186
And if we drop some wallets
and do some 20s, we'll...

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:19.605
- What's that?
- Where?

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:20.939
Behind us.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.400
I don't see nothin'.

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:26.653
- There's something back there.
- Nothin' but pitch black.

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:29.365
- I thought I seen something flicker.
- Nothin' there.

01:12:31.388 --> 01:12:33.786
- You put the money in the box?
- Uh-huh.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:36.455
I'll be glad to get out of this town,
I'll tell you that.

01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:41.085
There it is again.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.628
Dadblammit!

01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:44.713
Somethin' flickered, sure as hell.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.840
Nothin' behind us, Moze.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:51.762
- Uh-oh.
- I told ya!

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:57.184
- Who could it be?
- Christ!

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:07.277
- Don't stop, keep going!
- I can't keep going.

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:09.279
The damn car's in front of me.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.990
Everything's going to be all right.
You just let me do the talking.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:23.127
- You playin' games with us, Mister?
- Oh, I... I didn't know who was back there.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:26.213
It's a risky thing to do.
Might get your tyres shot off.

01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:27.548
Where you headin'?

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.175
Me and my little girl
are going to Saint Jo.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.010
- Oh. Live there?
- Nearby.

01:13:34.284 --> 01:13:36.473
- What's your business?
- Uh...

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:39.017
Livestock, mostly...
mules and horses. Some cattle.

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:42.938
That's funny.
I heard you was a bootlegger.

01:13:43.043 --> 01:13:45.649
Oh, no, sir, not me, friend.
Must be some mistake.

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:49.319
Maybe... Maybe not.

01:13:57.015 --> 01:13:59.121
The way I hear it...

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:02.541
you just had a transaction
by the old barn.

01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:04.460
Where'd you hear a thing like that?

01:14:04.565 --> 01:14:06.295
Oh, a... friend of the family.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:08.797
No, I'm sorry, I...

01:14:08.902 --> 01:14:11.508
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talkin' about bootleggin'.

01:14:12.197 --> 01:14:14.428
I'm talkin' about $625.

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:16.013
Now, just where might that be?

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:19.266
I don't have no $625.
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

01:14:19.371 --> 01:14:21.310
I don't even know where the old barn is.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.188
Well...

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:28.775
I reckon we'll just have to explain
a little more thoroughly, won't we?

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.320
Come on, Beau, you take a ride
with these nice people.

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:33.822
- Love to.
- We're all goin' back to town.

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.379
Damn.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:52.424
Just when you think you got it made...

01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:55.260
just ain't made, is it?

01:14:57.284 --> 01:14:59.765
- You pretty good at this little thing?
- Not too good.

01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:02.184
Not too good, huh?

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:04.895
Old bootlegger's sittin' there
with his own little game,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.523
and he ain't even good at his own game.

01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:12.444
Yes, sir, that is some good joke.

01:15:16.428 --> 01:15:18.575
I found these on the front seat.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.995
Wasn't any money in the car.
Went all through it, inside and out.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.623
Livestock business, huh?

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.292
That whisky's for a friend.

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.087
Hold out your hands.

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:33.173
- Huh?
- I said, hold out your hands. You heard me.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:45.602
I didn't say put 'em down, did I?

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:49.565
Mighty clean hands for livestock.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.483
Them hands don't look like
they do nothin' much

01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:53.735
except play a little casino
every now and then.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.737
I told you, that whisky's for a friend.
I didn't see no harm...

01:15:55.842 --> 01:15:57.114
Didn't see no harm?

01:15:58.011 --> 01:16:01.577
Hear that, Beau? Big bootlegger claims
he don't know the law.

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:05.831
Well, Mr Bootlegger, I don't need no
couple of bottles to make a case against you.

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:09.126
Law says all I need
is just one little ol' drop.

01:16:09.856 --> 01:16:13.422
And... law says you use a vehicle
to transport alcoholic beverages,

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:17.801
and said vehicle is confiscated
to be sold at public auctions, so...

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:20.679
you can just kiss that pretty
little ol' car of yours goodbye.

01:16:20.784 --> 01:16:22.556
Hey, hold on! That seems
pretty rough just because...

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.225
Don't lower your hands.
I didn't tell you to lower your hands.

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.269
I tell you to lower your hands,
then you lower your hands.

01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:29.980
You don't do nothin' till I tell you to.
Understand?

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:31.565
Answer me. You understand?

01:16:33.213 --> 01:16:34.735
Yes, sir.

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:41.908
Ah, I already done that.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:45.495
Ain't nothin' in his clothes 'cept him.
He ain't worth five cents.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.582
No, she ain't got
nothin' on her, either.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:52.044
You don't know what kind
of real bad trouble you're in.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:53.920
You better start thinking on it.

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:57.424
I've got a case against you
for possession and transportin' whisky,

01:16:57.529 --> 01:17:00.469
and I reckon if I try,
I can think of a few other things.

01:17:02.534 --> 01:17:05.140
Better face it, you're going to be
up in these parts for quite a while,

01:17:05.245 --> 01:17:07.225
working on the county roads.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:09.603
Maybe you're lucky,
you get out in six months.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:13.649
Six more months, influencing a child -
maybe get six years for that.

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:15.651
Maybe we could work something out.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.278
What's there to work out?

01:17:19.259 --> 01:17:21.031
'...while I rustle one up,

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.824
'you all listen to this little goodie

01:17:22.929 --> 01:17:24.284
'from a couple of years ago...'

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:30.624
Ah, I sure don't like to send a man
to a road gang. Never have.

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.293
Always felt sorry for them poor devils.

01:17:33.398 --> 01:17:37.381
But I can't overlook the fact
that you've been paid $625,

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:40.133
and you ain't tellin' me where it is.

01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:43.011
Now, I know you're a bootlegger,
so what's there for me to work out?

01:17:45.452 --> 01:17:48.475
All right. Let's cut this
ring-around-the-rosy.

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.520
Where's that... money?

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:11.498
You think I'm foolin' around?

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:14.376
I ain't foolin' around.

01:18:22.572 --> 01:18:24.803
Maybe you'll come around in time.

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:27.514
Get a little thirsty
and get a little hungry.

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:30.350
Time sure does have a way
with criminals, don't it, Beau?

01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:31.893
Sure do.

01:18:31.998 --> 01:18:33.353
Well, it's gettin' on to 5:00.

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:35.230
Somebody ought to be
stirring over at the café.

01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:37.274
I think I'll step over there a while.

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.735
See if that friend
of the family's there.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.445
I'll be on back 'fore long.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.239
I got all day, you know?
I got all the time in the world.

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.285
<i>Trouble's just a bubble</i>

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.871
<i>And the clouds will soon roll by</i>

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:53.498
<i>So let's have another cup of coffee</i>

01:18:53.603 --> 01:18:55.667
<i>And let's have another piece of pie</i>

01:18:55.772 --> 01:18:58.044
<i>Let a smile be your umbrella</i>

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.505
<i>For it's just an April shower</i>

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:03.091
<i>Even John D. Rockefeller...</i>

01:19:03.196 --> 01:19:06.470
Sir, may I get my things, please?

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:07.846
<i>Mr Herbert Hoover...</i>

01:19:07.951 --> 01:19:09.306
OK.

01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:12.768
<i>So let's have another cup of coffee</i>

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:15.479
<i>And let's have another piece of pie</i>

01:19:53.997 --> 01:19:55.435
Daddy...

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.813
I need to go to the shithouse.

01:20:02.422 --> 01:20:04.820
Well, uh, there's a place down the hall.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.280
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:20:07.385 --> 01:20:09.366
I want you to come stand by the door.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:11.660
All right if I go with her?

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:24.005
Down there.

01:20:32.452 --> 01:20:35.016
- Run!
- You crazy?

01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:36.184
Hey!

01:20:36.289 --> 01:20:38.937
Where are we running? Oh, my God.

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:42.190
Stop them people!
Hey, there's bootleggers!

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:45.861
Jesus Christ, this is the craziest...

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:48.113
- Hurry!
- I'm hurrying!

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:01.167
- Stop!
- Oh, Jesus!

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.841
- I'm going to hit him!
- Make him jump! Don't slow down!

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:12.262
I could have killed him!
They're going to have me up for murder!

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:16.558
- They're shooting at us!
- But they're missin'! Keep going!

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:27.319
- We ain't gonna make it.
- Yes, we will.

01:21:27.424 --> 01:21:30.488
Not in this car, we ain't. Every lawman in
Kansas is going to be looking for this car.

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.616
We got to get across the river
to Missouri.

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:34.034
Where's the bridge?

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:36.202
- Oh, Jesus!
- What's the matter?

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:38.204
- Damn bridge is the other way!
- What?

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.331
Hang on.

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.233
Ah, this ain't no good.
We're gonna make it too easy for 'em.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.569
We got to get off this road. Hang on!

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:16.952
Holy smoke!

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:19.120
Blow your horn!

01:22:19.225 --> 01:22:22.040
Won't do no good.
He can't pull off the road.

01:22:22.145 --> 01:22:24.918
Ain't we got all the luck,
selling whisky to a sheriff's brother?

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:32.509
Hang onto your hat.

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:34.010
- What?
- Hold on, I said.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.345
Oh, God!

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:48.525
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:51.861
OK, we threw a hobble on 'em for a while,
but we got to get off this road,

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.571
or we're going to end up
in a town for sure.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:56.574
And take that money out of there.
You like to give me heart failure.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.160
We made it, didn't we?

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:54.758
Anybody 't home?

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:04.684
Howdy.

01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:06.811
Need to get rid of my car here.

01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:12.150
I need to get rid of my car!

01:24:12.255 --> 01:24:15.111
Sheriff wants to take away my little girl,
put her in an orphanage.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.699
You know anybody who might want to swap?

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:24.412
How about that truck over there?

01:24:32.442 --> 01:24:34.506
Well, we'll just let him
chew on it a while.

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:41.638
Well, the rear tyres look new, anyway.

01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:59.614
- The radio looks OK.
- Think this thing runs?

01:24:59.719 --> 01:25:01.491
It better. We got to have
some way of travelling.

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:03.993
- Where we going to go?
- Out of Kansas, across the river to Saint Jo.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:05.829
That's where.

01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:09.249
Here he comes.

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:18.133
Look at 'em all.

01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:36.901
All I'm looking for is a swap
and three days' head start

01:25:37.006 --> 01:25:38.319
before you take it out on the highway.

01:25:42.545 --> 01:25:44.506
It's all legal.
Got the papers right here to prove it.

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.870
Just have to fill out that form
on the back, and you own it.

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.376
Ain't gonna swap.

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:55.795
Well, it's brand-new.

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.298
That car ain't no good.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:25:59.674
What's the matter with it?

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:02.385
Can't haul nothing in it.

01:26:02.907 --> 01:26:04.637
Oh, well, if that's all
that's bothering you,

01:26:04.742 --> 01:26:06.931
you can sell the car and get two trucks
to do your hauling in.

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:09.767
I ain't gonna swap.

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:11.144
Wrassle you for it.

01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:14.355
- Are you crazy?
- If I win, we swap.

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.065
You win, you can keep the car
and the truck both.

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:17.275
- Moze...
- Quiet down.

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:19.736
- What kind of wrassling?
- You name it.

01:26:20.758 --> 01:26:22.697
- Catch as can?
- Shoes or barefoot?

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:26.826
Makes no never mind to me.

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:28.453
Barefoot.

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:40.298
You're gonna get killed
just to give something away.

01:26:40.403 --> 01:26:42.383
I ain't got no choice.

01:26:43.489 --> 01:26:45.803
Get that city boy.

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:47.639
Get the city boy.

01:26:51.956 --> 01:26:53.311
Let's go.

01:26:53.416 --> 01:26:55.271
Make him say "calf rope", Leroy.

01:26:59.839 --> 01:27:01.569
Come on, Leroy. Get him, Leroy.

01:27:01.674 --> 01:27:03.404
Get him!

01:27:07.138 --> 01:27:10.203
That ain't fair! You stop that!
You make him fight fair!

01:27:10.808 --> 01:27:13.122
Look out for that rake, Leroy.

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.624
Watch out, Leroy.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.670
- Let's go in the car. Come on!
- Yee-haw!

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.298
Woo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

01:27:36.542 --> 01:27:39.524
- Are you pushing?
- Of course I'm pushing!

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:46.197
OK, it'll go now.
Put your foot on the brake.

01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:52.161
- The brake! The brake!
- It don't work!

01:27:55.228 --> 01:27:58.293
The brake, goddamn it! The brake!

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:21.024
Don't you even know
where the damn brake is?

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.859
It don't work.

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:24.193
Oh...

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:26.070
Well, it figures.

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:29.240
Well, we're in Missouri anyway.

01:28:29.345 --> 01:28:31.743
What'll we do now, drop some 20s?

01:28:33.725 --> 01:28:37.582
- How much money we got?
- $837 and some change.

01:28:37.687 --> 01:28:39.459
42 cents, I think.

01:28:39.564 --> 01:28:41.711
Well, we're just outside of St. Jo,
ain't we?

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:44.088
- So what?
- So...

01:28:45.528 --> 01:28:49.010
It's a big town, ain't it?
We can do better than 20s.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:54.724
'Y'all know that one.

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:57.393
"'Let's have another cup of coffee,
let's have another piece of pie."

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.896
'Well, it's 10:30,
and it's Sunday morning in St. Jo,

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:02.398
'and y'all get to church now, OK?

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:03.649
'Here's the news:

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:06.361
'In Omaha, President Roosevelt
told the nation last night...'

01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:07.653
- Moze?
- Yeah?

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:10.490
- What if that old man don't believe ya?
- He'll believe me, all right.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.076
He's in the market for making a killing,
just like we are.

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:14.869
Maybe he don't even have a silver mine.

01:29:14.974 --> 01:29:17.246
I had him checked out real thorough.
Where's the money?

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:20.666
And he's just what people say he is -
rich and greedy.

01:29:22.106 --> 01:29:24.379
'The independent candidate
for Senate this year...'

01:29:24.484 --> 01:29:26.631
- Pull up your socks.
- Moze...

01:29:26.736 --> 01:29:29.425
If we get a silver mine, we could get a house
and everything, couldn't we?

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:32.220
Everything, just... everything.

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:34.972
<i>Just around the corner,
there's a rainbow in the sky</i>

01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:36.599
<i>So let's have another cup of coffee</i>

01:29:36.704 --> 01:29:38.017
OK, you got it straight?

01:29:38.122 --> 01:29:40.061
Corner of East Warring and Burlington,
11 o'clock.

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:42.647
Just show there with tears in your eyes.
That's all.

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:45.149
Moze, don't forget the money.

01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:48.361
Of course I won't forget the money.

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:49.654
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

01:29:49.759 --> 01:29:52.198
Moze, could we get a piano, too?

01:29:52.303 --> 01:29:55.118
A piano? We'll have a whole factory.

01:29:59.018 --> 01:30:02.041
<i>Just around the corner</i>

01:30:02.146 --> 01:30:04.794
<i>There's a rainbow in the sky</i>

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:34.449
I guess you just didn't make
a good enough swap.

01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:38.119
My brother's real sore at ya.

01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:40.830
Seems you sold him
some of his own whisky.

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:44.208
You can't arrest me now.
We're in Missouri.

01:30:44.313 --> 01:30:46.002
And your damn brother's a bootlegger!

01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:50.047
You got an awful big mouth, Mister.

01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:54.469
Maybe I can't arrest you in Missouri,
and maybe I don't want to.

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:59.056
But I sure can make sure that you ain't gonna
feel real good while you're here.

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:08.983
Let's go!

01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:52.336
Addie...

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.098
Addie...

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:11.897
Moze.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:14.358
Moze...

01:33:14.463 --> 01:33:15.735
I sw...

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.403
I swallowed my gold tooth.

01:33:17.508 --> 01:33:19.822
- Aw, Moze.
- They took it all.

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:22.950
- Oh, Moze, you're all beat up.
- Ain't nothing left.

01:33:23.055 --> 01:33:26.245
Don't worry none. I've been keeping
ten dollars for emergencies.

01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:28.331
What the hell we do with ten dollars?

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.751
We could buy some bibles,
do a little widow business.

01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:34.629
Must be lots of good towns around here.

01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:37.006
Do some 20s, drop some wallets...

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:39.383
before you know it,
we'll be real good again.

01:33:39.488 --> 01:33:43.220
I'll bet in no time we could have
a whole new car and everything.

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:55.941
You're going to take me
to Aunt Billie's now, ain't ya?

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.238
- Aw, Moze...
- Don't start crying.

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:04.116
- I won't.
- That's where we set out for, ain't it?

01:34:21.113 --> 01:34:22.760
Looks nice.

01:34:22.865 --> 01:34:24.512
Yeah, it looks real fine.

01:34:28.454 --> 01:34:31.894
- That must be your uncle Daniel.
- He looks nice, too, don't he?

01:34:31.999 --> 01:34:33.938
Yup. Real nice.

01:34:36.921 --> 01:34:38.317
Maybe if Frank D. Roosevelt comes,

01:34:38.422 --> 01:34:40.486
he'll tell him to take me
to the station to see him.

01:34:40.591 --> 01:34:43.155
Maybe you write, ol' Frankie'll
have a place to write you back now.

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:44.448
Yeah, he might, at that.

01:34:44.553 --> 01:34:47.159
'Course he will.
Ain't no question but he will.

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:51.247
All this talk's just wasting time.

01:35:06.742 --> 01:35:09.890
Here's your...
here, your skates, your radio.

01:35:09.995 --> 01:35:11.892
- Where you gonna go?
- Don't worry about me.

01:35:11.997 --> 01:35:14.353
I got plans.
New ideas coming in every day.

01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:16.105
Get going.

01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:22.153
You know, if I knew for sure
you wasn't my pa...

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.615
It's for sure I ain't your pa.

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:30.578
Although sometimes I used to figure
Mr Connors could have been my pa,

01:35:30.683 --> 01:35:35.624
the way he touched my shoulder, get me
things from the candy counter for free.

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:39.378
And Mr Pritchard,
he smiled at me once real nice.

01:35:40.192 --> 01:35:42.590
Except they don't have my jaw
or nothing.

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:46.552
So long.

01:35:46.657 --> 01:35:48.888
Ain't you coming to the door with me?

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:52.892
There it is, right there.
How much closer am I supposed to bring you?

01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:54.769
They'll wonder how I got here.

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.438
Tell 'em a family friend brung you,

01:35:57.543 --> 01:36:01.275
and you had a little trouble on the way
with your car and with finances.

01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:03.027
Now, get going.

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:46.654
Yes?

01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:49.615
Yes?

01:36:51.096 --> 01:36:52.451
I'm Addie.

01:36:53.182 --> 01:36:54.703
Addie?

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:56.163
Addie!

01:36:56.268 --> 01:36:59.041
I've been worried sick about you.

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:01.585
Addie... come on in, child.

01:38:12.011 --> 01:38:13.282
I been writing letters,

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:15.784
and your Uncle Daniel's been trying
to call those people down there

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:17.453
to see where you've been.

01:38:18.142 --> 01:38:21.707
You're just the spitting image
of your mother, pretty as a picture.

01:38:21.812 --> 01:38:25.920
I don't know why I go on like this.
What you need is some ice-cold lemonade.

01:38:26.025 --> 01:38:28.964
Now you just sit right there,
and I'll be right back.

01:38:30.905 --> 01:38:33.594
Everybody's going to be
so happy to see you.

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:37.640
We're going to get
those clothes off of you.

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:40.601
You're going to get into
a nice, fresh, bath...

01:38:40.706 --> 01:38:42.895
and then you're going to sleep
in your own little bed,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.105
alongside your cousin, Edna.

01:38:46.795 --> 01:38:49.234
I just near give up on you, child.

01:38:50.716 --> 01:38:54.949
I bet you're starving to death.
I'm going to cut you a big piece of pie.

01:38:57.264 --> 01:39:00.663
We got those telegrams,
and then we never did hear from ya.

01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:56.677
I told you, I don't want you
riding with me no more.

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:04.351
You still owe me $200.

01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:15.696
Moze, look!

01:40:20.472 --> 01:40:21.994
Come on.

01:40:24.226 --> 01:40:25.789
Hurry up.

01:41:13.984 --> 01:41:16.799
<i>Keep your sunny side up</i>

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:21.095
<i>Keep it up high,
the side that gets blue</i>

01:41:21.825 --> 01:41:25.390
<i>If you have nine sons in a row</i>

01:41:25.496 --> 01:41:29.728
<i>Start a baseball team,
they make money, you know</i>

01:41:29.833 --> 01:41:33.732
<i>Keep your funny side up, don't let up</i>

01:41:33.837 --> 01:41:37.736
<i>Let your laughter come through,
doodley-doo</i>

01:41:37.841 --> 01:41:39.696
<i>Stand up on your legs</i>

01:41:39.802 --> 01:41:41.698
<i>Be like two fried eggs</i>

01:41:41.804 --> 01:41:44.743
<i>Keep your sunny side up</i>

01:41:45.305 --> 01:41:51.937
