00:05.000 --> 00:06.870
Behold!

00:06.900 --> 00:09.670
There is an adhesive bandage in

00:09.710 --> 00:11.170
my 'Nana pudding!

00:11.210 --> 00:15.680
I demand that it be removed!

00:15.710 --> 00:16.149
Thank you.

00:16.180 --> 00:17.580
Uh, you know, you

00:17.610 --> 00:20.650

00:20.680 --> 00:22.150

00:22.190 --> 00:24.020
Bring back the bandage.

Tonight's episode,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.130
What's going on in there?

01:08.160 --> 01:09.200
What's he doing?

01:09.230 --> 01:10.230
What's he doing?

01:10.270 --> 01:11.500
What's going on?

01:13.100 --> 01:15.870
How we lookin'?

01:15.910 --> 01:18.210
What's going on in there?

01:18.240 --> 01:20.040
Meatwad, I'm gonna need you to

01:20.080 --> 01:21.610
get me a visual on the building.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.710
Copy that?

01:23.280 --> 01:24.780
Well, right now,

01:24.810 --> 01:26.150
princess is riding a dinosaur

01:26.180 --> 01:28.480
over the rainbow in
magic candy kingdom.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.590
And they've been doing
that quite a bit.

01:30.620 --> 01:31.490
Something's up.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.890
I think I would have

01:32.920 --> 01:34.660
remembered our client mentioning

01:34.690 --> 01:36.560
that we were tracking a dinosaur.

01:36.590 --> 01:38.030
We're not getting paid enough

01:38.060 --> 01:39.630
for that, and we never discussed

01:39.660 --> 01:41.230
mileage to the magic candkingdom.

01:41.260 --> 01:42.560
I sure would like to

01:42.600 --> 01:43.630
get a wire on that dinosaur.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.570
Shake, just look at
the house, will you?

01:45.600 --> 01:46.700
Yeah, meatwad, you're

01:46.740 --> 01:48.140
looking at the wrong house.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.200
This disk, dummy.

01:49.970 --> 01:52.010
Oh, this is the house.

01:52.040 --> 01:52.570
Okay.

01:52.610 --> 01:53.880
No, damn it.

01:53.910 --> 01:54.810
Over there.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.780
Look, look. I see some action.

02:01.920 --> 02:02.680
Oh, h-hey, ma'am.

02:03.190 --> 02:03.990
How you doing there?

02:04.020 --> 02:04.990
Howdy, ma'am.

02:05.020 --> 02:05.920
Hey there.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.920
Hey, we're just three
guys hanging out.

02:07.960 --> 02:14.160
Y-you, uh,
need some help or...

02:14.200 --> 02:15.960
I don't think she saw us.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.070
Frylock, you're burned.

02:17.100 --> 02:17.770
You're out.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.070
Good, 'cause I was

02:19.100 --> 02:20.670
gonna leave anyways, 'cause this

02:20.700 --> 02:21.500
is boring, man.

02:21.540 --> 02:22.170
Fine.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.740
It's not the first case I've had

02:23.770 --> 02:24.910
to crack by myself.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.710
You just tell us exactly what

02:26.740 --> 02:28.540
we're supposed to do, and then

02:28.580 --> 02:30.210
don't let the door hit your vcr

02:30.250 --> 02:32.150
on the way out.

02:32.180 --> 02:34.550
What are you doing back there?

02:35.550 --> 02:36.720
Eh, eh, eh.

02:36.750 --> 02:37.790
That was the old show.

02:37.820 --> 02:38.850
Yeah, I know.

02:38.890 --> 02:40.090
This is the new show, where

02:40.120 --> 02:40.990
we're detectives.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.490
And you're no longer a part of

02:42.530 --> 02:45.430
it, so amscray...Uttface.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.160
Have fun getting soft.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.530
Hey, can I get me

02:48.570 --> 02:49.900
some more of them catfish nuggets?

02:49.930 --> 02:51.500
You ate that whole box?

02:51.530 --> 02:52.430
All gone.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.200
That was our entire advance!

02:54.240 --> 03:00.110
That's supposed to
last the whole night!

03:00.140 --> 03:02.950
Is it morning yet?

03:06.680 --> 03:07.920
Shake, wake up. Wake up.

03:07.950 --> 03:08.850
What?

03:08.890 --> 03:12.790
We got
action at 3:00 ... 6:00?

03:12.820 --> 03:14.860
Is the little hand the minute hand?

03:14.890 --> 03:15.720
Ha!

03:15.760 --> 03:17.090
So that's what he drives to

03:17.130 --> 03:20.000
visit his mistress.

03:20.030 --> 03:21.400
Another piece of the puzzle

03:21.430 --> 03:22.300
falls into place.

03:22.330 --> 03:23.700
But why would he do

03:23.730 --> 03:25.030
that to his own house, shake?

03:25.070 --> 03:27.740
Well, that's an insurance scam.

03:27.770 --> 03:30.940
Or he's trying to hide the evidence.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.540
We're going undercover.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.080
Oui, oui.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.540
Ha, ha, ha! Bonjour.

03:35.580 --> 03:36.950
I am your new neighbor.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.850
I just, uh, moved ... how you

03:38.880 --> 03:39.980
say ... move in.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.380
And you must be...

03:41.420 --> 03:43.090
Tearing this house down.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.650
Ah, ha, ha!

03:44.690 --> 03:46.620
To hide evidence, maybe, huh?

03:46.660 --> 03:49.760
Possibil insurance scam.

03:51.630 --> 03:54.060
No, no. It is cool.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.730
You can tell me, jacque.

03:55.770 --> 03:57.130
Everyone tells jacque.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.570
It's been vacant for 10 years.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.840
Ah, so that's your story.

04:01.870 --> 04:03.510
So maybe you can tell me...Why

04:03.540 --> 04:05.410
you're having an affair in there.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.010
Ha, ha, ha!

04:06.040 --> 04:07.510
Cuff him!

04:07.540 --> 04:09.000
Hey, shake, I don't

04:09.010 --> 04:10.710
think this is the right house or

04:10.750 --> 04:11.810
even the right dinosaur.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.550
Then why is our guy here?

04:13.580 --> 04:14.680
Well, 'cause ...

04:14.720 --> 04:15.920
'cause he got sent by the city

04:15.950 --> 04:17.420
to tear this empty house down.

04:17.450 --> 04:19.350
Then why is he large and black?

04:19.390 --> 04:20.560
The guy we're looking for is

04:20.589 --> 04:21.420
small and white.

04:21.459 --> 04:23.060
Y'all need to clear on out of here.

04:23.090 --> 04:23.930
I got work to do.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.360
All right, Chuck, I'm
gonna ask you once.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.660
Maybe you can tell me what kind

04:27.700 --> 04:28.930
of back-room operation you had

04:28.970 --> 04:30.070
to have to look like that.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.630
Huh?

04:35.100 --> 04:37.040
Did you see how close I was to

04:37.070 --> 04:39.440
nailing that guy?

04:39.480 --> 04:40.740
More water, please.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.740
I checked with our

04:42.780 --> 04:44.850
client, and, well, turns out she

04:44.880 --> 04:46.050
wasn't married.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.420
Then how come she had

04:48.450 --> 04:50.990
a husband who was having an affair?

04:51.020 --> 04:53.320
She didn't.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.620
Exactly.

04:54.660 --> 04:55.960
You can't have someone have an

04:55.990 --> 04:57.530
affair on you if you're single.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.860
We're gonna have to put a tail

04:58.900 --> 04:59.660
on this bitch.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.460
Look, man, I called her.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.800
She said she told you that she

05:02.830 --> 05:04.600
wanted us to find her cat for her.

05:04.630 --> 05:05.930
So we owe her $100

05:05.970 --> 05:07.800
worth of catfish nuggets.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.540
I think that guy took

05:11.570 --> 05:13.580
her cat and then framed us into

05:13.610 --> 05:14.740
saying we were detectives,

05:14.780 --> 05:16.280
because we clearly have not been

05:16.310 --> 05:16.910
trained for that.

05:16.950 --> 05:17.780
Yeah.

05:17.810 --> 05:19.750
I want a tail on her right now!

05:19.780 --> 05:21.020
I want you wearing a wire.

05:21.050 --> 05:22.520
I want her phone records and

05:22.550 --> 05:23.690
everyone she's e-mailed.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.820
I'm on it.

05:24.850 --> 05:26.420
No. No tails, okay?

05:26.460 --> 05:27.520
Look, this new show is not any

05:27.560 --> 05:28.290
good at all, man.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.390
I think we should just go back

05:29.430 --> 05:30.490
home and do what we used to do.

05:30.530 --> 05:30.960
No.

05:30.990 --> 05:33.400
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

Hyper-sleep?

05:43.610 --> 05:44.940
What the hell you want this for?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.340
We can't afford this, man.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.410
We're not gonna buy it, you idiot.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.640
We're gonna use it for nine

05:49.680 --> 05:51.650
years, and by that time, there's

05:51.680 --> 05:53.350
gonna be enough crime and

05:53.380 --> 05:55.050
supervillains going around for

05:55.080 --> 05:56.490
all detectives, not just the

05:56.520 --> 05:57.320
qualified ones.

05:57.350 --> 05:58.620
Aren't you worried

05:58.650 --> 06:00.960
just a little bit about doing this?

06:00.990 --> 06:02.860
Just hop in before the guy sees us.

06:02.890 --> 06:04.260
Come on. Plenty of room.

06:04.290 --> 06:05.360
Okeydokey.

06:05.390 --> 06:06.260
Whoa!

06:06.300 --> 06:07.560
What the hell are you doing?

06:07.600 --> 06:10.000
I thought we could maybe...
Snuggle?

06:10.030 --> 06:12.730
Well, that is a nine-year nightmare.

06:12.770 --> 06:14.870
Pass. You ride with
him into the abyss.

06:14.900 --> 06:15.900
All right, then.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.510
Can I bring this ducky into the abyss?

06:17.540 --> 06:19.010
Yeah, you can bring your ducky.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.010
And will you read me
this here pop-up book?

06:21.040 --> 06:22.610
Yes, I'll read you a book.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.580
Now, there ain't no

06:23.610 --> 06:24.610
monsters in there, is there?

06:24.650 --> 06:25.650
No. No monsters.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.350
Well, I just want to be sure.

06:27.380 --> 06:28.950
So, can I turn on this
little night-light?

06:28.990 --> 06:30.290
Look, this gas is

06:30.320 --> 06:31.890
gonna put you to sleep
in like 3 seconds.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.990
But will the gas

06:33.020 --> 06:35.320
rub my back and play piggy with

06:35.360 --> 06:37.290
my toes until I go to sleep?

06:37.330 --> 06:38.930
Shut up.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.530
Hyper-sleep,
go to nine years.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.700
Guys, I can't sleep.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.870
When is it supposed to start?

06:48.670 --> 06:49.440
Wait, guys?

06:49.470 --> 06:51.410
I feel something tickling my foot.

06:51.440 --> 06:56.880
Can you help me get out
of here for a sec...

06:56.910 --> 06:57.850
come on.

06:57.880 --> 06:58.950
Ain't no way in hell I'm

06:58.980 --> 07:00.580
sleeping in a tube for nine years.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.820
Hey, you told me

07:01.850 --> 07:03.490
they weren't no monsters in there.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.490
Oh, that's not a monster, man.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.620
That's a creature from space.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.490
Looks like a big old purple hand.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.660
Yeah, I don't care.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.590
It's not our problem.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.530
All right.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.760
Damn, his voice was
annoying, wasn't it?

07:27.040 --> 07:28.910
Oh, man!

07:28.950 --> 07:32.580
I had the...
World's craziest dream.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.320
All right, I was eating the

07:34.350 --> 07:36.050
world's largest hot dog, and you

07:36.090 --> 07:37.490
were there, frylock.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.290
But for some reason, you were

07:39.320 --> 07:40.690
Chinese, and I could not

07:40.720 --> 07:42.390
understand what you were saying.

07:42.430 --> 07:44.460
Then all my teeth started falling out.

07:44.490 --> 07:45.660
This is when I should

07:45.700 --> 07:46.860
probably say something.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.700
Aah!

07:57.940 --> 07:59.370
Good morning. How are you?

07:59.410 --> 08:00.340
Who are you?

08:00.380 --> 08:01.610
I'm Danny, and I own the

08:01.640 --> 08:02.610
hyper-sleep chamber.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.850
Look, I-I'm sorry.

08:03.880 --> 08:04.880
I was just borrowing.

08:04.910 --> 08:06.010
My friend made me do it.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.750
Frylock ... shh.
It's okay.

08:07.780 --> 08:08.820
It's where we met.

08:08.850 --> 08:09.990
Excuse me?

08:10.020 --> 08:11.520
When I looked into your

08:11.550 --> 08:13.720
closed eyes, I knew you were the one.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.320
What ... what
do you mean by that?

08:16.360 --> 08:17.930
I've been making love to your

08:17.960 --> 08:20.430
face off and on for
the last nine years.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.660
Don't throw up.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.800
Where I come from, it's beautiful.

08:24.830 --> 08:26.700
Do you have a name?

08:26.740 --> 08:29.000
Look, let's not get into names.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.710
It was just a physical thing, a fling.

08:31.740 --> 08:33.480
I needed a warm orifice to

08:33.510 --> 08:34.909
deposit eggs, that's all.

08:34.940 --> 08:36.039
And now it's over.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.710
For nine years?!

08:37.750 --> 08:38.549
I know.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.750
It's a long time to stay committed.

08:40.780 --> 08:44.020
The sex got, well, a little boring.

08:44.049 --> 08:45.520
I was asleep!

08:45.550 --> 08:46.890
I know what you mean.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.460
We lost our identities
in the relationship.

08:49.490 --> 08:50.730
We're different people.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.960
I'm not even a person.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.560
But I had no choice in the matter.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.300
Shh. Don't end it this way.

08:56.330 --> 08:57.800
Let it go. What's done is done.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.600
For God sakes, tell me

08:59.640 --> 09:01.270
you at least used protection.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.740
Look, we both know this
isn't working out.

09:03.770 --> 09:05.640
I just think I need to see other

09:05.680 --> 09:07.580
people...Who are asleep.

09:09.350 --> 09:13.520
Why do I have clamps on my butt?

09:13.550 --> 09:15.580
Well, it was just something I

09:15.620 --> 09:16.650
wanted to try.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.420
Look, could we at least stay in touch?

09:19.460 --> 09:20.690
What's your name?

09:20.720 --> 09:21.320
Aah!

09:21.360 --> 09:22.990
Aah! Lightning!

09:23.030 --> 09:23.830
Aah.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.860
You son of a bitch!

09:25.900 --> 09:29.000
1, 2, 3, 4...
All right, how much

09:29.030 --> 09:30.330
could I possibly owe you?

09:30.370 --> 09:30.870
N-nothing.

09:30.900 --> 09:31.900
Everything's free now.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.370
Then mow down some of

09:33.400 --> 09:34.900
those nimrods over there for free.

09:34.940 --> 09:35.940
That would be bad.

09:35.970 --> 09:36.870
We're all good now.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.270
And I want you to have a good day.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.340
Baby-killing jerks!

09:40.380 --> 09:41.640
Hey, hey! No pushing!

09:41.680 --> 09:42.810
Don't go in there, lady!

09:42.850 --> 09:44.250
I'm about to march

09:44.280 --> 09:45.550
right into that abortion clinic

09:45.580 --> 09:47.350
and tell them it's not a

09:47.380 --> 09:48.880
choice ... it's a child!

09:49.990 --> 09:51.790
I'd like 1,200 face abortions.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.690
Can I get a discount because I'm

09:53.720 --> 09:54.960
getting them in bulk?

09:54.990 --> 09:55.820
No prob.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.530
You be good and have a good day.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.500
So, can we blow it up or what?!

10:02.530 --> 10:03.670
No, no, no.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.330
Uh, I just told them that life

10:05.370 --> 10:07.840
is precious, and they agreed.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.570
Blow it up, anyway!

10:14.610 --> 10:16.480
Wonderful.

10:16.510 --> 10:19.350
Let's get an abortin'.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.450
What's up with all this lightning?

10:23.490 --> 10:28.020
Aqua unit patrol squad, assemble!

10:28.060 --> 10:30.630
Now, I said!

10:30.660 --> 10:33.800
Do not make me come in there!

10:33.830 --> 10:36.460
Hello?

10:36.500 --> 10:38.470
Frylock?

10:38.500 --> 10:40.400
Meatwad?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.700
Willie Nelson?

10:42.740 --> 10:44.640
Love mummy?

10:44.670 --> 10:47.610
Those frat alien guys?

10:49.350 --> 10:50.450
No.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.950
No! What have I done?!

10:53.950 --> 10:57.000
