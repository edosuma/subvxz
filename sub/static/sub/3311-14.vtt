WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:09.977
Melissa: "MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED
IN FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.180
( grunting )

00:12.213 --> 00:14.215
- HEY, BURKE...
- ( grunting )

00:16.717 --> 00:21.522
ARE YOU WORKING OUT OR
GIVING BIRTH TO AN ARMCHAIR?

00:24.325 --> 00:26.294
FROM WHERE I'M SITTING I
COULD PUNCH YOU SO HARD

00:26.327 --> 00:27.995
IT WOULD CHANGE YOUR VOICE.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.199
SO TELL ME, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
DID YOU LOSE A BET?

00:31.232 --> 00:34.502
OH, VERY FUNNY. NO.
I LOST MY BREATH.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.704
THE ELEVATORS WERE OUT AT WORK
AND I HAD TO TAKE THE STAIRS.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.639
AND BY THE THIRD FLIGHT
I WAS GASPING FOR AIR.

00:38.672 --> 00:42.476
- THE THIRD FLIGHT?
- WELL, ALMOST THE FOURTH.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.179
ANYWAY, THE 5K RUN FOR THE SCHOOLS
THAT I STUPIDLY SIGNED UP FOR

00:45.213 --> 00:46.647
IS AROUND THE CORNER
AND THEN IT HIT ME.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.517
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING
TO HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, RUN?

00:49.550 --> 00:52.186
NO. I GOTTA STOP
SIGNING UP FOR STUFF.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.222
BUT IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.724
YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING TO GO
WHEN YOU'RE A BUSY SINGLE WOMAN

00:56.757 --> 00:59.393
RAISING YOUR CONVICTED SISTER'S
TEENAGERS... YOUR WORKOUT.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.595
MEL, PLEASE, BEFORE THE
KIDS AND THE COUNCIL THING,

01:01.629 --> 01:04.632
YOUR IDEA OF A WORKOUT WAS
DANCING DRUNK TILL DAWN.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.601
YEP. AND WITH THE RIGHT TRAINER

01:07.635 --> 01:09.270
I CAN REGAIN THAT
KIND OF ENDURANCE.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.372
ALL RIGHT, SO WHEN DO
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

01:11.405 --> 01:14.275
YOU WANT TO TRAIN IN THE
MORNING BEFORE YOU GO TO WORK?

01:14.308 --> 01:17.278
UH, HOW ABOUT WHEN
YOU'RE NOT AROUND?

01:17.311 --> 01:20.214
OH, DID YOU THINK WHEN I SAID
A TRAINER THAT I MEANT YOU?

01:20.248 --> 01:22.283
WELL, YEAH. I MEAN, WHO ELSE?

01:22.316 --> 01:25.586
SHORT ANSWER? ANYBODY ELSE.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.688
- ( doorbell rings )
- OOH, THAT'S MY TRAINER!

01:27.721 --> 01:29.657
- YOU WANT ME TO... OKAY OKAY.
- ( clears throat )

01:32.293 --> 01:34.528
WHY ARE YOU WORKING OUT BEFORE
YOUR TRAINER COMES OVER?

01:34.562 --> 01:36.730
IT'S LIKE CLEANING THE HOUSE
BEFORE THE CLEANING LADY COMES

01:36.764 --> 01:39.333
OR WASHING THE DISHES BEFORE YOU
PUT THEM IN THE DISHWASHER.

01:39.367 --> 01:42.736
YEAH, OR OTHER THINGS
THAT YOU NEVER DO.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.473
YEAH? HI.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.342
HELLO. I'M LINDSAY GATES
LOOKING FOR MEL BURKE.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.778
- YOU FOUND HER.
- IT IS YOU!

01:50.811 --> 01:52.246
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND TOO NERDY,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.682
BUT I WATCH ALL THE
CITY COUNCIL HEARINGS.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.252
AW, A PUBLIC ACCESS FAN THAT
DOESN'T WEAR A TINFOIL HAT.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.720
I FEEL LIKE I'M
TRAINING A CELEBRITY.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.290
OH PLEASE, I'M JUST ANOTHER
OUT-OF-SHAPE COUNCILPERSON...

02:02.323 --> 02:03.824
THE YOUNGEST OUT-OF-SHAPE
COUNCILPERSON

02:03.857 --> 02:05.659
IN THE CITY'S
HISTORY, BY THE WAY.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.728
WELL, THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT GOING TO BE

02:07.761 --> 02:09.830
ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS,
BECAUSE YOU LOOK GREAT.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.632
OH, SHUT UP. I DO NOT.
I LOVE YOU!

02:11.665 --> 02:14.134
YOU'RE LIKE MY... YOU'RE
MY NEW BEST FRIEND.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.636
YOU LADIES CAN FEEL FREE
TO USE MY WEIGHT BENCH

02:15.669 --> 02:17.338
OUT IN THE GARAGE
IF YOU NEED IT.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.308
I DON'T BELIEVE IN WEIGHTS.
THE BODY IS ITS OWN GYM.

02:20.341 --> 02:24.278
OKAY. WELL, PLUS YOU SAVE ON MEMBERSHIP
FEES TOO, SO THAT'S KIND OF COOL.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.280
THIS IS JOE LONGO. HE
TAKES CARE OF THE KIDS.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.615
HOW? BY BENCH-PRESSING THEM?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.783
( laughing ) N-NO.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.754
- ALTHOUGH I COULD.
- HMM.

02:33.787 --> 02:37.124
HONEY, DON'T WORRY. WE ARE
NOT DOING THAT TO YOU.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.194
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HERE TO GET HER IN SHAPE.

02:40.228 --> 02:43.831
THE SHAPE OF A REAL PERSON,
NOT AN ACTION FIGURE.

02:43.864 --> 02:47.701
- NOW LET'S GET GOING.
- OKAY.

02:47.735 --> 02:51.605
- SHE'S GREAT, ISN'T SHE?
- GRATING? YES, SHE IS.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.808
HULK MAD. SMASH MANY WALLS.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.644
( laughs )

02:58.178 --> 03:03.617
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME ♪

03:07.421 --> 03:11.792
WOW, THREE SESSIONS DEEP AND
I FEEL BETTER, STRONGER.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.295
A NEW ME... GLUTEUS FABULOUS.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.432
THAT'S THE ENDORPHIN RUSH,
ANOTHER BENEFIT OF EXERCISE.

03:18.466 --> 03:22.202
WHO KNEW A LEGAL HIGH
COULD FEEL SO GOOD?

03:22.236 --> 03:25.273
I MEAN EXCEPT FOR STRAIGHT
As IN HIGH SCHOOL.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.275
OH YEAH, I LOVE THAT STORY.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.643
DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO
TRY THE POMEGRANATE JUICE

03:29.677 --> 03:31.479
- WITH VODKA?
- I'M A BELIEVER.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.548
NOW I CAN GET MY DRINK ON THANK YOU.
ANTIOXIDANTS,

03:34.582 --> 03:36.717
HEY, ANYTHING FOR
MY FAVORITE CLIENT.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.719
OKAY, BLISS SISTERS,

03:38.752 --> 03:40.788
I'M GOING TO GO GRAB A
FEW MINUTES ON THE BENCH

03:40.821 --> 03:42.723
IF YOU'RE ALL THROUGH
WITH YOUR LADY WORKOUT.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.792
YOU DO ANY ELONGATING
FOR THOSE MUSCLES?

03:44.825 --> 03:46.327
WHO'S ASKING?

03:46.360 --> 03:49.730
I WAS JUST THINKING YOU COULD
BENEFIT FROM YOGA OR PILATES

03:49.763 --> 03:51.432
TO GIVE YOU SOME FLEXIBILITY

03:51.465 --> 03:54.835
INSTEAD OF THIS POPEYE
THING YOU GOT GOING.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.505
( laughing ) POPEYE.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.908
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT ONE.
WELL, I NEVER SAID IT OUT LOUD.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.944
LISTEN, AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE
YOUR UNSOLICITED MEDDLING,

04:03.977 --> 04:07.648
WHICH REALLY ISN'T A LOT,
LET ME JUST SAY THAT...

04:07.681 --> 04:09.883
( imitates Popeye,
laughs ) I AM WHAT I AM.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.822
HE'S JUST A LITTLE
SENSITIVE, YOU KNOW?

04:14.855 --> 04:17.391
- SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO...
- SURE, I'LL GO EASY ON HIM.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.827
NO NO NO. A NEW CAN
OF SPINACH."AR HIM

04:25.766 --> 04:28.469
( sighs )

04:28.502 --> 04:30.771
OKAY, WAS THAT A
YOU-WANT-TO-TALK SIGH

04:30.804 --> 04:32.773
OR A STAY-OUT-
OF-MY-BUSINESS SIGH?

04:32.806 --> 04:36.276
I'M OKAY, JUST LISTENING
TO SOME MUSIC.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.547
OH. "SONGS THAT MAKE ME
FEEL ALIVE, FROM BECKETT."

04:39.580 --> 04:41.682
"SONGS THAT MAKE ME
CRY, FROM BECKETT."

04:41.715 --> 04:44.685
"SONGS FROM BECKETT,
FROM BECKETT."

04:44.718 --> 04:46.320
- WHO ARE THESE FROM?
- BECKETT.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.522
- OH.
- WE WERE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.291
THIS WAS THAT CUTE GEEKY GUY,
RIGHT, WHO HAD A CRUSH ON YOU?

04:51.325 --> 04:53.994
YES, THAT'S HIM. HE'S
SEEING ALEXIS SWENTON NOW

04:54.027 --> 04:56.830
AND HE'S OFF-LIMITS
AND I LOST A FRIEND.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.799
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT TO BE
HIS GIRLFRIEND OR ANYTHING,

04:58.832 --> 05:00.501
BUT I MISS HANGING OUT WITH HIM.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.436
OKAY, SO YOU WANT THE
FRIENDSHIP BACK?

05:02.470 --> 05:04.838
YES. CAN THAT WORK?

05:04.872 --> 05:06.974
CAN YOU BE FRIENDS WITH A
GUY WHO HAS A GIRLFRIEND?

05:07.007 --> 05:10.478
SURE. BOYS JUST
NEED INSTRUCTIONS.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.880
YOU GOTTA TELL THEM WHAT YOU
WANT AND DEFINE THE BOUNDARIES.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.915
OH, AND WEAR BAGGY CLOTHES.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.322
- BECKETT.
- HEY, LENNOX.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.525
LONG TIME NO... FRIEND.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.694
YEAH.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.929
- IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I COME IN?
- YEAH YEAH.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.998
THAT'S KIND OF WHY
I ASKED YOU OVER.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.001
JUST MAKING SURE. DIDN'T
WANT TO PUSH THINGS.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.870
SO I BURNED YOU A NEW MIX CD.

05:38.038 --> 05:41.642
"SONGS OF FRIENDSHIP
ONLY, FROM BECKETT."

05:41.675 --> 05:43.411
NICE.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.878
AND A BUNCH OF GRAPHIC NOVELS

05:44.912 --> 05:48.081
WHERE THE HERO DOES
NOT GET THE GIRL.

05:48.115 --> 05:51.051
- YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS WELL.
- IT WAS ALL IN YOUR TEXT.

05:51.084 --> 05:54.087
I EVEN PRINTED OUT A
COPY FOR REFERENCE.

05:54.121 --> 05:58.325
WOW, YOU LAMINATED IT.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.061
OF COURSE. IT'S ♪ IMPORTANT.

06:04.064 --> 06:07.067
- PUT THAT DOWN.
- OH.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.771
SO, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
UP TO, MY GOOD FRIEND?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.440
OH, I BROUGHT YOU THIS FLYER.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.875
THEY'RE DOING A WHOLE WEEK OF
FRENCH FILMS AT THE MUSEUM.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.777
OH, ARE YOU GUYS GOING?

06:16.810 --> 06:21.415
NO. ALEXIS HATES SUBTITLES
AND FRENCH PEOPLE

06:21.449 --> 06:24.117
AND ANYTHING WHERE MIMES
COULD SUDDENLY APPEAR.

06:24.151 --> 06:27.020
BUT MAYBE... WE COULD GO.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.722
- AS FRIENDS, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.692
BECAUSE SOME THINGS YOU DO
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND...

06:31.725 --> 06:33.594
SOME THINGS YOU DO WITH
YOUR FRIEND FRIEND.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.663
NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING
WRONG WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

06:35.696 --> 06:41.435
NO. ALEXIS IS GREAT.
SHE IS... GREAT.

06:41.469 --> 06:44.472
GREAT GREAT.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.474
THE BEST PART OF JOSH MOVING OUT

06:46.507 --> 06:48.742
IS I HAVE A LOT
MORE CLOSET SPACE

06:48.776 --> 06:50.644
AND A LOT LESS CHEATING ON ME.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.646
- ( laughs )
- YOU CAN LAUGH, BUT YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE POSE.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.716
OKAY, I'M HOLDING THE POSE
AND I'M HOLDING IN MY PEE.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.017
THAT'S A GOOD EXERCISE TOO.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.520
OH WOW, YOU'RE WORKING
EVERY MUSCLE I'VE GOT.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.822
MEL, HEY, I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,

07:01.855 --> 07:03.791
BUT YOUR PHONE'S BEEN
RINGING OFF THE HOOK.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.559
AND I KNOW I'M FORBIDDEN
TO ANSWER IT,

07:05.593 --> 07:08.662
BUT THEN THIS TEXT CAME IN THAT
SAID "UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT."

07:08.696 --> 07:11.098
OH MY GOD, I MISSED FOUR CALLS.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME SOONER?

07:11.131 --> 07:14.868
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET SICK OF
"HEY YA" UNTIL THE FOURTH ONE.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.670
THEY MOVED UP MY BUDGET HEARING.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.971
I'M SORRY, LINDS. I GOTTA GO.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.773
YOU STILL HAVE 15 MINUTES.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.775
YOU KNOW WHAT? MY
GIFT TO YOU, JOE...

07:21.809 --> 07:24.545
15 MINUTES WITH AN ACTUAL TRAINER.
YOU TWO PLAY NICE.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.480
WHOA, WAIT, M-MEL. ACTUALLY...
YO, MEL?

07:26.514 --> 07:30.584
( stuttering ) THAT'S...
I'M REALLY...

07:30.618 --> 07:32.653
WELL, I'D BE VERY HAPPY
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING,

07:32.686 --> 07:34.722
BUT I DON'T THINK IT
WOULD DO ANY GOOD.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.825
YOU REALLY THINK I COULD BENEFIT
FROM YOUR LITTLE GIRLIE STRETCHES?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.527
GIVE IT A TRY.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.963
UNLESS YOU THINK IT'S
SOMETHING YOU CAN'T DO.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.733
CROUCH DOWN LIKE THAT
WITH BOTH ARMS OUT?

07:45.766 --> 07:47.234
WHEW, THAT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.772
WHERE'D YOU LEARN THIS, HUH?
THE BACK OF A GRANOLA BOX?

07:52.806 --> 07:54.608
WHERE DOES ALL THIS
ANGER COME FROM?

07:54.642 --> 07:56.777
DID YOU GET IT WITH THE MUSCLES?

07:56.810 --> 07:59.613
MAYBE IT COMES FROM THE FACT I'VE BEEN
WORKING OUT SINCE THE SECOND GRADE.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.849
NOW I HAVE A KNOW-IT-ALL IN TIGHTS
TELLING ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:01.882 --> 08:05.553
WELL, IF YOU CAN'T DO
IT, YOU CAN'T DO IT.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.721
( snorts ) OH PLEASE.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.857
( clears throat )

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
- STRAIGHT HERE.
- OKAY.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.063
- POINT THIS WAY.
- YEP.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.698
- TIGHTEN THE STOMACH.
- YO.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.733
- LIFT THE RIBCAGE.
- ALL RIGHT.

08:19.767 --> 08:23.804
- NOW BREATHE.
- ( snorts )

08:23.837 --> 08:27.641
YOU DON'T LIKE WHEN WOMEN
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO, DO YOU?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.944
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO A REAL
MAN IN A WHILE, HAVE YOU?

08:30.978 --> 08:34.081
- IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE? A REAL MAN?
- YEAH.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.284
- YOU WANT TO FIND OUT?
- SO BAD.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.858
CELL PHONE, CELL PHONE.
WHERE'S MY CELL PHONE?

08:44.892 --> 08:46.894
OH RIGHT.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.772
THOSE ARE NOT APPROVED
STRETCHING EXERCISES.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.184
LONGO TAKES THE BALL
ACROSS MID-COURT.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.186
HE'S GOT TWO SECONDS LEFT.
HE SHOOTS, HE SLAMS!

09:13.220 --> 09:15.555
WHOO! NOTHING BUT COUCH.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.290
LOOK AT YOU CLEANING THE HOUSE.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.060
WELL, IT IS PART OF MY JOB DESCRIPTION.
I AM, AFTER ALL, THE NANNY.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.829
( gasps ) YOU HATE THAT WORD.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.832
EVERY TIME I USE IT, YOU MAKE ME
PUT A DOLLAR IN THE SWEAR JAR.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.002
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY I
HAD A GOOD MORNING.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.305
YEAH, ABOUT YOUR GOOD MORNING,

09:32.339 --> 09:36.977
AHEM, I MAY HAVE SEEN JUST A
SMALL PIECE OF HOW GOOD IT WAS.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.848
WHAT WAS THAT NOW?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.282
YEAH, I LEFT MY CELL
PHONE IN THE GARAGE

09:42.315 --> 09:44.051
AND WHEN I WENT IN
THERE TO GET IT,

09:44.084 --> 09:47.655
THERE YOU WERE WITH LINDSAY, ALL
PRETZELED UP ON MY YOGA MAT.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.222
I GOT OUT OF THERE
AS FAST AS I COULD,

09:49.256 --> 09:51.058
BUT THE IMAGE OF
YOUR SWEATY WORKOUT

09:51.091 --> 09:53.694
HAS BURNED INTO MY RETINAS
AND IT WON'T GO AWAY!

09:55.996 --> 09:58.666
- WHOOPS.
- WHOOPS? THAT'S IT?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.300
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?
NOTHING MORE?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.269
NOT, OH I DON'T
KNOW, "I APOLOGIZE.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.171
THAT WAS HORRIBLY
INAPPROPRIATE"?

10:04.204 --> 10:06.674
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT GAVE ME THE LAST
15 MINUTES OF YOUR SESSION WITH HER.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.341
- YOU PRACTICALLY THREW HER AT ME.
- I THREW HER?

10:08.375 --> 10:10.210
WHAT WAS THIS, A
HUMAN RING TOSS?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.880
YOU KNOW WHAT? ACTUALLY I
DO OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

10:12.913 --> 10:17.150
I WAS WRONG. SHE IS... SHE
IS ONE HELL OF A TRAINER.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.852
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.188
YOU HAD A MOMENTARY
FLING WITH MY TRAINER.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.290
YOU'RE A GUY. YOU
HAVE NO RESTRAINTS.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.894
SO WE'LL JUST FORGET THIS EVER
HAPPENED AND NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.

10:26.927 --> 10:30.230
NO, HUH-UH. LINDSAY AND
I REALLY HIT IT OFF...

10:30.263 --> 10:32.866
- TWICE.
- UGH, GROSS!

10:32.900 --> 10:35.035
AS A MATTER OF FACT, TONIGHT
WE'RE GOING OUT TO DINNER

10:35.068 --> 10:37.337
AND TOMORROW NIGHT SHE'S TAKING
ME TO ONE OF HER FAVORITE CLUBS.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.708
WAIT, ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT
A RELATIONSHIP IS STARTING?

10:40.741 --> 10:44.211
- YEPPERS, I THINK I AM.
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT WAS OKAY.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.180
I DIDN'T REALIZE I NEEDED YOUR
PERMISSION FOR THIS. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

10:47.214 --> 10:51.218
COME DOWN TO CITY HALL TOMORROW AND
APPLY FOR, LIKE, A SEX PERMIT?

10:51.251 --> 10:55.322
NO. NO, BUT WE DO HAVE
LEASH LAWS, YOU HOUND.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.657
LOOK, LINDSAY'S MY TRAINER.
YOU'RE MY NANNY.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.694
IT'S LIKE I'M PAYING PEOPLE TO SLEEP
WITH EACH OTHER. WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

11:01.929 --> 11:04.397
BEST BOSS EVER!

11:06.333 --> 11:08.235
COME ON, LOOK, YOU KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH HER

11:08.268 --> 11:09.937
AND I'LL KEEP DOING WHAT
I'M DOING WITH HER.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.105
AND AS LONG AS WE KEEP THAT
SEPARATE, EVERYTHING WILL BE COOL.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.942
UNLESS YOU DON'T THINK
THAT YOU CAN HANDLE THAT.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.211
PLEASE, I'M AN ADULT.
YOU'RE AN ASPIRING ADULT.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.013
WE COULD BE ADULT ABOUT THIS.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.949
WE'LL JUST KEEP OUR
BUSINESS SEPARATE

11:21.982 --> 11:23.350
AND BE RESPECTFUL OF EACH OTHER.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.152
DEAL.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.720
WOW, THAT'S ONE HECK OF A GRIP.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.121
A BENEFIT OF LINDSAY'S TRAINING.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.790
YOU SURE IT'S NOT JUST A
DEEP RESERVOIR OF ANGER?

11:29.823 --> 11:31.324
- ( chuckles ) JUST SHAKE MY HAND.
- OKAY.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.361
( music playing )

11:34.394 --> 11:36.797
THAT SONG IS SICK. WHERE
DO YOU FIND THESE BANDS?

11:36.830 --> 11:40.834
GUNTER... MY ONLINE CHESS
PARTNER IN BERLIN.

11:40.868 --> 11:45.705
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, ALEXIS IS NOT
A FAN OF THIS SONG... AT ALL.

11:45.739 --> 11:49.176
- ( sighs )
- BUT SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND YOU REALLY LIKE HER.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.445
I DO. I DO.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.315
THE SOUND DESIGN ON THIS
NEXT SONG IS GROUNDBREAKING.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.350
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

11:58.451 --> 12:02.255
UM... YOU WANT A SODA?
YEAH, ME TOO.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.324
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.061
HEY, NEW YOGA MAT?

12:08.095 --> 12:12.132
BRAND NEW, NEVER BEEN
USED IN ANY WAY.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.002
SO LISTEN, AUNT MEL,

12:15.035 --> 12:18.906
THIS WHOLE BECKETT-FRIEND THING
ISN'T REALLY WORKING OUT.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.741
EVERY TIME HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HIS LAME
GIRLFRIEND DOESN'T APPRECIATE HIM,

12:21.775 --> 12:23.343
I JUST WANT TO PUT
MY ARMS AROUND HIM.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.478
WELL SURE, YOU WANT
TO COMFORT A FRIEND.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.849
I WANT TO KISS HIM, LIKE A LOT.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.417
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.752
IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE
PLACE IS IN HEAT.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.221
OKAY, YOU ARE ONLY
ATTRACTED TO HIM

12:34.254 --> 12:37.224
BECAUSE HE IS TRAGICALLY
TAKEN AND UNHAPPY.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.892
WHY DID YOU PUSH ME INTO THIS?

12:38.926 --> 12:40.293
WHY DOES EVERYONE
THINK I'M PUSHING?

12:40.327 --> 12:42.362
YOU PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS.
I'M TRYING TO HELP.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.432
OKAY LOOK, YOU WANTED TO
BE HIS FRIEND, RIGHT?

12:45.465 --> 12:49.202
RIGHT. YEAH, I JUST
GOTTA STAY FOCUSED.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.205
- FRIENDSHIP.
- GOOD GIRL. STAY STRONG.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.074
HEY, AND DON'T LOOK IN HIS EYES

12:54.107 --> 12:56.243
AND DON'T SNIFF HIS SHIRT.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.017
- RYDER?
- MORNING, AUNT MEL.

13:04.051 --> 13:07.154
THERE'S FRESH COFFEE IF YOU WANT IT.
IT'S FRESH.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.322
- YOU DON'T DRINK COFFEE.
- MM, I DID TODAY.

13:09.356 --> 13:12.225
WIDE AWAKE. MOUNTAIN GROWN.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.094
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP SO EARLY?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.029
THE J.V. CHEERLEADERS ARE
HAVING THEIR TRY-OUTS

13:16.063 --> 13:18.331
AND A FEW OF US ARE GOING
TO GO OVER AND... YOU KNOW.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.534
- WATCH GIRLS KICK AND BEND?
- BASICALLY.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.536
GREAT, SO THE HORMONE
FAIRY GOT YOU TOO.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.808
- OH, HEY, EVERYBODY.
- WHOA, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

13:28.842 --> 13:32.145
I WAS OUT LATE LAST NIGHT.
DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.414
( chuckles ) WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP THIS EARLY?

13:34.447 --> 13:36.383
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ALLERGIC TO DAWN.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.518
WELL, I HAVE MY PRACTICE
5K WITH LINDSAY.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.253
SHE SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.791
- MORNING.
- OR SOONER.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.127
HEY, I'M GOING TO MAKE OMELETS.
WHAT DO YOU WANT IN YOURS?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.029
- MM, COFFEE.
- COFFEE.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.898
YOU KNOW, I THINK SHE
MAY HAVE SLEPT OVER.

13:50.931 --> 13:54.234
REALLY? GET OUT OF HERE.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.503
I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO
BE ANYWHERE THIS MORNING.

13:56.536 --> 14:00.207
UM, ACTUALLY YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE SOMEPLACE.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.475
- REALLY?
- YEAH, HERE.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.812
YOU KNOW, OUR RUN AT 7:30 SHARP?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.115
OH YEAH. SORRY.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.951
THERE'S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE, LINDS.
IT'S ONLY 7:29.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.953
ACTUALLY YOU'RE EARLY.
YOU DRINK YOUR COFFEE.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.454
WE'LL GET SOME BREAKFAST
AND YOU'LL BE GOOD.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.056
- ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
- YEAH SURE.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.158
WHAT A GREAT MORNING, HUH?
I'M MAKING BREAKFAST,

14:18.191 --> 14:21.128
LINDSAY'S ALREADY HERE AND AS SOON AS
YOU PULL THAT STICK OUT OF YOUR BUTT,

14:21.161 --> 14:22.462
YOU'LL BE GOING FOR A NICE RUN.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.334
I'M SORRY I GOT MAD
BACK THERE, LINDS.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.170
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
COUNTING ON THIS RUN TODAY

14:30.203 --> 14:33.040
AND I APPRECIATE YOU GETTING
YOURSELF TOGETHER FOR ME.

14:33.073 --> 14:36.476
LINDSAY, YOU GOTTA
PULL BACK NOW.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.345
( snoring )

14:40.080 --> 14:42.282
OH, THIS IS WORKING OUT PERFECT.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.094
THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HAD
QUITE A WORKOUT THERE,

14:54.127 --> 14:56.863
DRAPING A BLANKET OVER
MY UNCONSCIOUS TRAINER.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.299
LOOK, IT'S MY FAULT SHE WAS OUT
SO LATE, SO DON'T BE MAD AT HER.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.868
- JUST BE MAD AT ME.
- DONE.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.403
ONE ERROR IN JUDGMENT... MINE...
SHOULDN'T DESTROY

15:03.436 --> 15:05.172
YOUR WHOLE FRIENDSHIP
WITH LINDSAY, ALL RIGHT?

15:05.205 --> 15:07.240
SHE'S A GREAT GIRL AND
A PHENOMENAL TRAINER.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.409
I MEAN, SHE HAS FLEXIBILITY,
MEL, LIKE I HAVE NEVER...

15:09.442 --> 15:11.344
OKAY OKAY, STOP RIGHT THERE.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.181
OKAY, I FORGIVE LINDSAY
AND YOU, EVENTUALLY,

15:14.214 --> 15:16.383
BUT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF
WHAT I'M DOING WITH LINDSAY.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.351
AND YOU NEED TO BE
AWARE OF WHAT I'M...

15:18.385 --> 15:21.221
- DOING WITH LINDSAY.
- NO NO NO, STOP STOP! THE IMAGE IS COMING BACK.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.223
LOOK, I MEAN CLEARLY WE
NEED TO BE MORE SERIOUS

15:23.256 --> 15:25.092
ABOUT HOW WE SCHEDULE
THESE THINGS BECAUSE

15:25.125 --> 15:27.260
JUST BEING RESPECTFUL OF EACH
OTHER IS NOT WORKING OUT.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.396
SO HOW ABOUT THIS? YOU SET
ALL OF YOUR WORKOUT TIMES

15:29.429 --> 15:31.598
AND THEN LINDS AND I WILL
PLAN OUR DATES AROUND THAT?

15:31.631 --> 15:33.333
- THIS WAY NOBODY GETS HURT.
- FINE.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.368
TOMORROW IS SUNDAY AND
WE'RE NOT WORKING OUT.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.504
AND TONIGHT I HAVE MY
BIG TOWN HALL MEETING,

15:37.537 --> 15:39.239
SO THE KIDS WILL
BE AT THEIR PARTY

15:39.272 --> 15:40.974
AND YOU GUYS CAN HAVE THE
HOUSE TO YOURSELVES.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.176
JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. I
JUST DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT

15:43.210 --> 15:44.978
AND I DEFINITELY DON'T
WANT TO SEE IT.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.546
DEAL.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.215
OOH, YOU REALLY ARE
GETTING STRONGER.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.084
NO, THIS TIME IT'S REALLY ANGER.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.253
( sports on TV )

15:53.286 --> 15:55.355
UGH, FOOTBALL.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.290
DO YOU EVER WATCH FOOTBALL?

15:57.324 --> 15:59.993
- ( TV turns off )
- ONLY IRONICALLY.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.694
BUT YOU KNOW WHO
REALLY LIKES FOOTBALL?

16:01.728 --> 16:05.698
- ALEXIS?
- YEAH.

16:05.732 --> 16:09.036
LENNOX, IF I WERE TO,

16:09.069 --> 16:12.605
LET'S SAY HYPOTHETICALLY,
BREAK UP WITH ALEXIS,

16:12.639 --> 16:14.474
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU MIGHT

16:14.507 --> 16:17.510
HYPOTHETICALLY WANT
TO GO OUT WITH ME?

16:17.544 --> 16:19.446
WHAT?

16:19.479 --> 16:23.250
I MEAN, IF YOU WERE WILLING TO COMMIT,
I'D DROP ALEXIS IN A NANOSECOND.

16:23.283 --> 16:27.387
- IT'S A VERY SMALL UNIT OF TIME...
- NO, BECKETT, I KNOW.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.457
WOW, THIS IS VERY FLATTERING.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.592
SO YOU'RE GOOD TO GO?
YOU'LL BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

16:32.625 --> 16:35.095
- I'LL CALL HER RIGHT NOW.
- OKAY, WAIT.

16:35.128 --> 16:38.265
SO IF I AGREED TO GO OUT WITH
YOU, YOU'LL DUMP ALEXIS.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.500
BUT IF I SAY NO,
YOU'LL STAY WITH HER?

16:40.533 --> 16:42.435
WELL YEAH. IT'S
SIMPLE ECONOMICS.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.072
A GUY DOESN'T QUIT A JOB TILL
HE'S GOT ANOTHER ONE LINED UP

16:45.105 --> 16:47.740
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK
TO BEING SELF-EMPLOYED.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.546
OKAY, BUT IF WE'RE DATING
AND YOU FIND ANOTHER GIRL

16:53.580 --> 16:57.250
- WHO'S EVEN HOTTER, WILL YOU DUMP ME?
- OF COURSE NOT.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.486
WAIT, HOW HOT ARE WE TALKING?
STACY GLASSGOLD?

16:59.519 --> 17:03.256
- BECKETT, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU?
- I DON'T KNOW!

17:03.290 --> 17:05.658
YOU KNOW, I NEVER HAD A
GIRLFRIEND TILL A MONTH AGO.

17:05.692 --> 17:10.297
AND NOW I SEE ALL THESE POSSIBILITIES
AND IT'S VERY OVERWHELMING.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.599
WELL, LET'S MAKE THIS
SIMPLER FOR YOU.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.268
YOU NOW HAVE ONE
LESS POSSIBILITY.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.206
OH.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.674
SO WE'RE BACK TO BEING FRIENDS?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.376
UH-HUH.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.246
WITH NO CHANCE OF IT TURNING
INTO ANYTHING ELSE?

17:26.279 --> 17:29.216
NO CHANCE.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.452
SO NO HARD FEELINGS THEN IF I
TAKE OFF AND GO SEE ALEXIS?

17:34.821 --> 17:37.390
YEAH FINE, GO. GO SEE ALEXIS.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.292
GO SEE STACY, BECAUSE
ACCORDING TO YOU,

17:39.326 --> 17:40.627
ALL GIRLS ARE INTERCHANGEABLE.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.296
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.798
UGH, WHAT WAS I THINKING?

17:45.832 --> 17:48.301
I MISS HIM ALREADY.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.507
PLEASE DON'T BE DOING IT.
PLEASE DON'T BE DOING IT.

17:54.541 --> 17:59.246
- PLEASE DON'T BE DOING IT.
- I'LL JUST GRAB ANOTHER BOTTLE OF WINE, ALL RIGHT?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.581
WHAT... WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:01.614 --> 18:04.251
- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE IS ALL MINE TONIGHT?
- IT IS, IT IS.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.586
I'M JUST GOING TO SNEAK UPSTAIRS AND
PUT ON MY SEX-CANCELING HEADPHONES.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.221
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
GET DOWN HERE.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.390
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE GOING TO BE
AT CITY HALL ALL NIGHT TONIGHT.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.058
THERE WAS A BOMB SCARE.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

18:12.091 --> 18:14.227
I DON'T KNOW. STAY THERE?
TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM?

18:14.261 --> 18:17.197
MEL! WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.233
YEAH, I'M A QUIET
INVISIBLE SURPRISE.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.636
I'M JUST GOING TO GRAB
THIS DELICIOUS CONTAINER

18:23.670 --> 18:26.639
OF, UH, BROWN FOOD MEAT

18:26.673 --> 18:29.242
AND GO UPSTAIRS AND EAT IT
ALL BY MYSELF IN MY ROOM.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.610
- NICE. BON APPETIT.
- NO.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.579
JOE, GO GET ANOTHER
PLATE FOR MEL.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.315
- I'M GOING TO BRING OUR WINEGLASSES IN.
- ( laughs )

18:35.348 --> 18:37.250
ALL RIGHT, LINDS.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.352
TAKE YOUR NONDESCRIPT LEFTOVERS
AND GET UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.588
- BUT LINDSAY INVITED ME TO DINNER.
- WELL, I'M UNINVITING YOU.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.391
LOOK, SOMETHING KIND OF SPECIAL IS
STARTING TO HAPPEN HERE, ALL RIGHT?

18:44.424 --> 18:46.359
I THINK SHE IS BECOMING
MY GIRLFRIEND.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.261
AND I DON'T NORMALLY
PULL RANK HERE,

18:48.295 --> 18:52.165
- BUT GIRLFRIEND TRUMPS TRAINER.
- OH REALLY?

18:52.199 --> 18:55.268
I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE PLAYING "ROCK
PAPER SCISSORS GIRLFRIEND TRAINER."

18:55.302 --> 18:57.337
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.673
I GUESS I CAN FIND A NEW
TRAINER MUCH MUCH EASIER

19:00.707 --> 19:02.409
THAN YOU CAN FIND
A NEW GIRLFRIEND.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.378
YOU REALLY COULD HAVE JUST
STOPPED AT "YOU'RE RIGHT."

19:05.412 --> 19:08.481
- JUST LET ME TELL HER, OKAY?
- FINE, ALL RIGHT.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.184
I'M GOING TO GO GRAB ANOTHER BOTTLE
OF WINE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.487
HEY, LINDSAY, SIT DOWN.
LET'S TALK FOR A SECOND.

19:14.521 --> 19:18.325
UM... I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO TRAIN WITH YOU ANYMORE.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.794
- WHY?
- BECAUSE IT'S JUST MESSY WITH THE THREE OF US.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.531
AND WHAT YOU AND JOE HAVE IS
MORE IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW?

19:24.564 --> 19:26.399
YOU GUYS HAVE A
REAL RELATIONSHIP.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.402
- NO, WE DON'T.
- SAY WHAT?

19:29.436 --> 19:31.238
I WOULDN'T CALL IT
A RELATIONSHIP.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.406
I'D CALL IT A GREAT
WAY TO BURN CALORIES.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.875
OH, SO THAT'S ALL JOE IS TO YOU...
JUST CARDIO?

19:35.908 --> 19:38.478
THERE'S SOME STRENGTH
TRAINING IN THERE TOO.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.814
YOU THOUGHT I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT JOE?
NO WAY.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.384
OH, SO THIS WAS
ALWAYS ABOUT THE SEX?
