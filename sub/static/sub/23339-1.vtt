01:39.770 --> 01:42.838
Sorry, I forgot which way
I'm supposed to turn.

01:42.873 --> 01:44.239
Ok, that's a cut on rehearsal.

01:44.274 --> 01:46.541
Everett, you're going
to the right.

01:46.577 --> 01:48.643
Ok, towards our heroine,

01:48.679 --> 01:50.979
ready to push her through
the break away railing.

01:51.015 --> 01:52.881
Ok. Alright, got it.
Sorry, guys.

01:52.917 --> 01:54.750
Ok, that's what rehearsals
are for.

01:54.819 --> 01:57.652
Ok, just- we fight here.

01:57.688 --> 01:58.887
Yeah.

01:58.923 --> 02:04.993
And then we go over here
and she throws me over.

02:05.029 --> 02:06.962
Glad it's a stunt man
and not me, right?

02:07.031 --> 02:08.430
Ok.

02:08.497 --> 02:10.065
Everybody, are we all happy?

02:10.133 --> 02:11.800
How's the shot looking?

02:11.836 --> 02:12.835
Good.

02:12.903 --> 02:13.869
Will, can you give Celia
the heads up?

02:13.904 --> 02:14.937
We're shooting in 10 minutes.

02:14.972 --> 02:15.871
You got it.

02:15.906 --> 02:16.538
No, no.

02:16.573 --> 02:18.140
No, no, no.

02:18.175 --> 02:21.043
I- we already budgeted for those
flowers in the wedding scene.

02:21.078 --> 02:22.244
Yes.

02:22.279 --> 02:25.114
Well, I don't care if
they're not in season.

02:32.723 --> 02:33.856
How you doing, Taylor?

02:33.924 --> 02:35.824
Hey, Will.

02:38.763 --> 02:40.495
Meredith.

02:40.530 --> 02:42.164
I didn't know you were
on the schedule today.

02:42.233 --> 02:44.733
I thought you knew everything
that goes on around here.

02:44.769 --> 02:46.001
Usually.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.874
[knocking]

02:51.909 --> 02:55.443
Miss Shaw? Mr. Parker
wants you on set.

02:58.282 --> 03:01.383
[knocking]

03:01.451 --> 03:04.386
Celia, it's Will.
I'm coming in.

03:06.757 --> 03:07.756
Celia?

03:13.630 --> 03:14.897
Help!

03:14.932 --> 03:16.598
Somebody help!

03:16.633 --> 03:17.933
Something's wrong
with Celia!

03:17.968 --> 03:19.935
Call 911!

04:02.246 --> 04:04.279
Our mystery section
is right over here.

04:04.348 --> 04:06.648
If you like the classics
we have Agatha Christie,

04:06.683 --> 04:08.483
very intricate mysteries.

04:08.518 --> 04:10.652
If you like something
more contemporary,

04:10.721 --> 04:13.889
Charlaine Harris is fabulous.

04:13.958 --> 04:15.290
What about that mystery writer

04:15.326 --> 04:17.159
who lived here in Lawrenceton
for a while?

04:17.228 --> 04:20.728
Oh, Robin Daniels,
he is my favourite.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.566
If you really wanna dig
into mysteries

04:24.601 --> 04:26.835
you should consider coming
to the Real Murders Club.

04:26.871 --> 04:29.704
We have a meeting tonight.

04:29.773 --> 04:31.740
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

04:31.775 --> 04:33.175
Oh, go.

04:34.478 --> 04:35.077
Hey.

04:35.145 --> 04:36.111
Hi.

04:36.146 --> 04:38.013
Sorry to interrupt you here
at work.

04:38.082 --> 04:40.382
No, you're never
an interruption.

04:40.417 --> 04:43.886
Um, I'm afraid I can't make
dinner tonight after all.

04:43.954 --> 04:44.953
Oh.

04:44.989 --> 04:46.488
Yeah, unfortunately I got
a message

04:46.556 --> 04:47.890
from a CIA colleague

04:47.925 --> 04:51.459
and he hinted at some bad news
about my old partner.

04:51.495 --> 04:53.161
Oh, the one that's like
a brother to you?

04:53.230 --> 04:54.263
Yeah, Rex.

04:54.298 --> 04:56.064
So I've gotta make
some calls tonight,

04:56.100 --> 04:57.665
see if I can figure out
what is going on.

04:57.701 --> 04:58.934
Yeah, of course.

04:58.969 --> 05:00.602
But you know, you could have
just called me

05:00.637 --> 05:01.703
and left a voice message.

05:01.738 --> 05:04.373
Oh, big fan of your
voice mail message

05:04.408 --> 05:07.109
but I'll take the real you
any day.

05:07.144 --> 05:08.476
Sorry about tonight.

05:08.545 --> 05:10.245
I better get a rain cheque.

05:10.281 --> 05:12.147
You get two.

05:12.182 --> 05:13.748
Oh.

05:22.659 --> 05:23.725
And you have two weeks.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.394
Thank you.

05:28.498 --> 05:31.300
Martin cancelled dinner
with me tonight.

05:31.368 --> 05:33.001
And you're telling me
this why?

05:33.037 --> 05:35.103
It's called sharing.

05:35.139 --> 05:36.071
Oh.

05:36.106 --> 05:38.073
Well, you may continue then.

05:38.108 --> 05:40.742
Well, at least I can have dinner
at home with my mother.

05:40.811 --> 05:43.145
Ah, you're still living
with Aida?

05:43.180 --> 05:44.446
Yeah.

05:44.481 --> 05:47.715
Sometimes I regret taking
that offer on my house.

05:47.751 --> 05:50.419
Selling that house was one of
your more intelligent decisions.

05:50.454 --> 05:52.054
The odds of turning up
dead there are much higher than

05:52.089 --> 05:53.188
the statistical average.

05:53.223 --> 05:54.389
I don't see why you regret it.

05:54.425 --> 05:56.158
Yeah, that house was starting
to feel cursed.

05:56.193 --> 05:58.126
Although I wish I had lined up
a place to live

05:58.162 --> 05:59.094
before I sold it.

05:59.129 --> 06:00.562
Nonsense.

06:00.597 --> 06:02.664
With such a good offer out
of the blue why would you wait?

06:02.699 --> 06:05.968
Lillian, could you imagine
living with your mother again?

06:06.003 --> 06:07.869
Oh.

06:17.348 --> 06:18.646
Hi, mother.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.349
I thought you were having dinner
with Martin tonight.

06:20.417 --> 06:21.783
He had to cancel.

06:21.818 --> 06:25.153
So I was hoping that I could
take you to dinner

06:25.189 --> 06:26.855
before the Real Murders Club
meeting.

06:26.923 --> 06:29.091
I don't need you to babysit me.

06:29.126 --> 06:30.525
I'm not going to collapse
because John wanted

06:30.560 --> 06:32.560
to move closer to
his grandchildren.

06:32.629 --> 06:34.196
Oh, mother.

06:34.264 --> 06:36.231
We both know that the only
reason John moved

06:36.266 --> 06:38.200
was because you wouldn't
marry him.

06:38.235 --> 06:40.435
John Queensland is a lovely man
and I really enjoyed

06:40.471 --> 06:43.938
our time together but I just
never saw him as my husband.

06:43.974 --> 06:45.507
Oh, but here.

06:45.542 --> 06:49.244
This is a new listing I think
that you will really like.

06:49.279 --> 06:50.745
Nice. I like this neighbourhood.

06:50.780 --> 06:52.014
Can we go see it now?

06:52.049 --> 06:53.548
No, I haven't got time.

06:53.583 --> 06:55.650
I'm showing rentals to a movie
director who's coming to town.

06:55.685 --> 06:57.486
Yeah, he's gonna be here
for a couple of months.

06:57.554 --> 06:59.454
Why would a movie director
wanna stay here?

06:59.490 --> 07:01.523
I can't say.

07:01.558 --> 07:03.025
What about dinner?

07:03.093 --> 07:04.259
I've made plans.

07:04.294 --> 07:06.428
But I'm sure you'll find
something in the fridge.

07:06.463 --> 07:09.597
And maybe a way to keep
the crumbs off the table.

07:09.633 --> 07:10.899
It was two crumbs!

07:10.934 --> 07:13.068
One time!

07:22.212 --> 07:24.346
Aida.

07:24.381 --> 07:26.381
Hey.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.449
Hello, again.

07:27.518 --> 07:28.716
Mr. Weir, right?

07:28.752 --> 07:30.052
Please, call me Will.

07:30.087 --> 07:31.853
Ms. Teagarden.

07:32.989 --> 07:34.322
Joel Parker.

07:34.358 --> 07:35.823
We meet at last.

07:35.859 --> 07:37.059
Mr. Parker.

07:37.094 --> 07:38.626
I had no idea meeting me
was so high on the list.

07:38.662 --> 07:40.128
Well, I had Will do
some research

07:40.164 --> 07:41.463
on real estate agents
in the area

07:41.532 --> 07:43.765
and you seemed to be in
a class all by yourself.

07:43.833 --> 07:44.732
Well...

07:44.801 --> 07:46.435
Much like this town, actually.

07:46.470 --> 07:48.437
It's in a class of its own.
It's absolutely gorgeous.

07:48.472 --> 07:49.837
Mmm.

07:49.873 --> 07:53.341
So, you think you can find me
a nice place to stay?

07:53.377 --> 07:54.509
I always do.

07:54.578 --> 07:57.412
Well, thank you.
Let's go.

08:03.454 --> 08:05.420
So glad you decided to join
the club again, Arthur.

08:05.489 --> 08:06.654
Oh, it's nice to be back.

08:06.690 --> 08:07.822
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

08:07.857 --> 08:09.191
It's good to have a law
enforcement angle

08:09.226 --> 08:10.592
represented in our discussions.

08:10.627 --> 08:12.026
Yeah, how does Lynn feel
about it?

08:12.062 --> 08:13.995
I know she isn't a fan of
real murders.

08:14.030 --> 08:17.299
Yes, which might be why I never
mentioned it to her.

08:17.334 --> 08:20.569
A man has to protect the
serenity of his pregnant wife.

08:20.637 --> 08:23.738
Man, it is so strange to have
this meeting without John.

08:23.773 --> 08:25.707
Yeah, he was one of
the founding members.

08:25.742 --> 08:27.409
I'm looking forward
to Sally talking about

08:27.478 --> 08:29.277
this Chinatown trunk
murder tonight.

08:29.313 --> 08:31.313
Oh, actually Sally had
to leave town to cover

08:31.348 --> 08:32.547
the Peterson story,

08:32.582 --> 08:34.582
but I think Perry Dell's
gonna fill in for her.

08:34.650 --> 08:37.152
Oh, no. I can't tonight.

08:37.187 --> 08:38.986
Perry, don't you look spiffy.

08:39.054 --> 08:40.888
Yeah, Sally got him a job
at the paper.

08:40.924 --> 08:42.323
Yes, it was my idea.

08:42.359 --> 08:44.126
He did some writing on
the youth mentor newsletter

08:44.160 --> 08:45.360
I edit for the city.

08:45.429 --> 08:46.861
I was pretty impressed.

08:46.896 --> 08:48.029
Wow, Perry.

08:48.064 --> 08:49.431
A man of many talents.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.833
And you clean up pretty nice,
too.

08:51.868 --> 08:53.401
Oh, thanks.

08:53.437 --> 08:55.604
I borrowed my dad's jacket just
in time for my first interview.

08:55.672 --> 08:57.372
Hey, uh, I need to have
this story in tonight.

08:57.407 --> 08:58.607
Can I give you Sally's stuff?

08:58.642 --> 08:59.807
Yes, of course.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.743
So Perry, who, uh, who are
you interviewing?

09:01.778 --> 09:02.744
Oh, I brought him with me.

09:02.779 --> 09:04.579
He used to be in the club.

09:06.183 --> 09:07.349
Hi, Ro.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.284
Robin Daniels.

09:09.353 --> 09:10.552
Hi.

09:10.587 --> 09:13.355
You didn't tell me you were
coming to town.

09:13.390 --> 09:15.557
I wanted to surprise you.

09:15.592 --> 09:18.193
And of course I arrive on the
day of a Real Murders meeting.

09:18.228 --> 09:19.794
Hi, everyone.

09:19.829 --> 09:22.897
I wish I could stay but I've got
this interview and photos

09:22.932 --> 09:24.932
and all kinds of stuff.

09:25.001 --> 09:26.134
Oh.

09:26.170 --> 09:30.238
Ok, but- but why are you here?

09:30.274 --> 09:32.874
It's a long story.

09:32.909 --> 09:35.443
Let's get together tomorrow.
I'll tell you everything.

09:35.479 --> 09:36.645
Ok, I'll be at work.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.146
Perfect. I'll come
by the library.

09:38.215 --> 09:40.748
Hey, Perry. You ready to go?

09:40.817 --> 09:43.751
It's good to see you, Ro.
You look great.

09:47.357 --> 09:49.591
He's pretty famous, right?

09:49.626 --> 09:51.259
Pretty famous.

09:51.295 --> 09:52.694
Cool.

09:54.097 --> 09:56.798
He's also being
pretty mysterious.

09:59.169 --> 10:01.035
Alright, that's the last
of them.

10:01.071 --> 10:02.070
Do you need any more help?

10:02.105 --> 10:04.005
Oh, no. I've got it.
I'll lock up.

10:04.040 --> 10:04.872
Ok, 'night, Ro.

10:04.908 --> 10:05.740
Goodnight.

10:05.775 --> 10:07.108
Hey, Martin.

10:08.111 --> 10:10.945
Oh, in a day full of surprises
this one's my favourite.

10:10.980 --> 10:15.217
I couldn't let the day end
without seeing you again.

10:15.252 --> 10:18.119
Oh, did you find out any news
about your old partner?

10:18.154 --> 10:19.654
Not yet.

10:19.690 --> 10:22.457
I've got a bunch of feelers out
there, I should know more soon.

10:22.526 --> 10:25.059
You're not gonna ask me your
usual 50 questions about it?

10:25.128 --> 10:25.860
Huh?

10:25.895 --> 10:27.229
What?

10:27.264 --> 10:32.500
Sorry, um... we had an
unexpected visitor tonight

10:32.536 --> 10:33.468
at our meeting.

10:33.503 --> 10:35.403
Robin Daniels.

10:35.439 --> 10:37.939
Oh, the writer you dated?

10:38.007 --> 10:40.709
Oh, we went out a few times,
I wouldn't call it dating.

10:40.777 --> 10:42.277
Well, whatever you call it,

10:42.312 --> 10:44.212
I hope he didn't come back
to town to ask you out again.

10:44.248 --> 10:45.480
No. If anything,

10:45.515 --> 10:47.882
I think I was more of
an afterthought for him.

10:47.951 --> 10:50.151
Aurora Teagarden,
an afterthought?

10:50.220 --> 10:51.119
Impossible.

10:51.187 --> 10:52.721
Come over for coffee?

10:52.756 --> 10:55.189
It's a little late, are you sure
your mother won't object?

10:55.259 --> 10:57.259
Not if you're a good boy.

10:57.294 --> 10:59.026
Scout's honour.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.130
You never were a scout,
were you?

11:02.165 --> 11:03.431
Nope.

11:04.268 --> 11:05.800
[laughs]

11:10.974 --> 11:13.107
"A movie based on the book
Whimsical Murder

11:13.143 --> 11:16.210
"by bestselling author
Robin Daniels will be shot in

11:16.280 --> 11:18.913
"and around Lawrenceton
starting next Monday.

11:18.948 --> 11:21.449
"According to Daniels,
Lawrenceton is the inspiration

11:21.518 --> 11:24.386
"for the story's setting".

11:24.421 --> 11:26.120
The last thing we need
is Hollywood

11:26.156 --> 11:29.056
descending on us creating
who knows what mayhem.

11:29.092 --> 11:30.625
If Robin Daniels
likes Lawrenceton

11:30.661 --> 11:32.360
it's a funny way to show it.

11:32.429 --> 11:36.364
Lillian, we should be happy
for Robin and his success.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.833
That's good of you to say, Ro.

11:38.868 --> 11:41.269
And Lillian, great
to see you again.

11:41.305 --> 11:42.837
Hello, Robin.

11:42.872 --> 11:44.071
Hi.

11:47.944 --> 11:49.844
I am happy for you.

11:49.879 --> 11:53.014
Your first book to be turned
into a movie?

11:53.049 --> 11:54.316
And maybe my last.

11:54.351 --> 11:56.150
It's all been a bit maddening.

11:56.219 --> 11:59.688
Well, why is it that I've never
heard of "Whimsical Murder"?

11:59.723 --> 12:02.223
I sold the rights when it
was still in manuscript form,

12:02.258 --> 12:04.225
and then I got hired to write
the script.

12:04.260 --> 12:05.927
Now they're rushing
the movie into production

12:05.995 --> 12:07.662
so it'll come out just
after the book.

12:07.698 --> 12:09.964
Well, why wouldn't you just
call me and tell me all this

12:09.999 --> 12:11.899
before you came to town?

12:11.935 --> 12:14.469
I wanted to tell you in person.

12:14.504 --> 12:18.540
The main character in the book
is inspired by you.

12:21.311 --> 12:22.143
Me?

12:22.178 --> 12:23.244
Yes.

12:23.279 --> 12:24.446
I named her Adelaide.

12:24.481 --> 12:27.816
She's a mystery-solving
librarian.

12:27.851 --> 12:32.153
I guess you got a hold of
my imagination, Ro.

12:32.222 --> 12:33.455
Thanks.

12:33.523 --> 12:35.323
Of course, I told the actress
playing Adelaide

12:35.359 --> 12:36.924
about you and she wants
to meet you.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.493
Says she'd love to come by
the library tomorrow

12:38.562 --> 12:40.027
if that's alright.

12:40.063 --> 12:45.132
Oh, um... I- I don't know if
Lillian would like that very-

12:45.168 --> 12:47.469
I just got a call from the movie
production company.

12:47.537 --> 12:48.737
They want to rent out
the library

12:48.772 --> 12:51.105
and shoot some scenes here.

12:51.140 --> 12:55.009
They said I can be
in the movie.

12:59.583 --> 13:02.851
Well, I guess that solves
that problem.

13:05.288 --> 13:07.955
So the lead character
is based on you?

13:07.991 --> 13:11.259
Yeah, I'm a little bit flattered
and a little bit uncomfortable.

13:11.327 --> 13:12.827
But everyone else seems
to be really happy

13:12.863 --> 13:14.362
that the movie is in town

13:14.431 --> 13:17.432
and Perry got Robin to give him
a little part in the movie

13:17.501 --> 13:20.502
so he could write what it's like
being in a production

13:20.537 --> 13:21.836
for the paper.

13:21.905 --> 13:24.873
Perry Dell, a writer
and an actor.

13:24.908 --> 13:26.741
Interesting.

13:26.810 --> 13:28.042
[laughter]

13:28.111 --> 13:30.612
Ro, we were just talking
about you.

13:30.647 --> 13:32.079
This is Joel Parker,
the director.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.549
I finally get to meet
Robin's muse.

13:34.618 --> 13:36.885
Oh, yeah. Hi.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.086
And this is her accomplished
beau, Martin Vartel.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.187
[phone ringing]

13:40.223 --> 13:41.489
Joel Parker.

13:41.525 --> 13:44.158
I'm so sorry, I have
to take this.

13:44.227 --> 13:45.527
You know what?

13:45.562 --> 13:47.061
I should call Will, get him
to bring a car around.

13:47.096 --> 13:49.297
You know, you two
should drop by set.

13:49.332 --> 13:50.331
Oh.

13:50.366 --> 13:52.467
I promise you,
you'd have a great time.

13:52.536 --> 13:54.268
Yeah?

13:56.807 --> 13:59.707
I find him incredibly charming.

13:59.743 --> 14:00.742
Mother.

14:00.777 --> 14:02.343
Are you here on a date?

14:02.378 --> 14:04.479
Would it be so surprising
if he'd asked me out?

14:04.514 --> 14:06.280
Oh, no, of course not. I-

14:06.316 --> 14:09.484
No, I'm- I'm not ready to jump
into the dating pool just yet.

14:09.519 --> 14:12.253
No, um, Joel liked the house
I found him so much

14:12.288 --> 14:14.856
that he's asked me to find
other locations.

14:14.891 --> 14:17.892
I'm a... location scout.

14:17.961 --> 14:19.293
Wow.

14:19.329 --> 14:21.763
You're the last person I thought
would get all swept up

14:21.798 --> 14:23.765
in this Hollywood hoopla.

14:23.834 --> 14:26.668
I guess it's the lure
of the exotic.

14:30.574 --> 14:32.306
I'm so sorry.

14:32.342 --> 14:34.141
I've gotta get back
to my computer

14:34.177 --> 14:35.276
and I gotta make
some calls.

14:35.311 --> 14:37.579
Is everything ok?

14:37.614 --> 14:40.014
My contact just told me
he's been briefed that Rex

14:40.049 --> 14:41.816
has gone missing while
on assignment.

14:41.852 --> 14:44.251
Oh oh, I'm so sorry.

14:44.287 --> 14:46.721
Yes, go.
Of course.

14:46.790 --> 14:48.456
I'll get something to go.

14:48.492 --> 14:49.824
Ok.

15:01.538 --> 15:02.937
There we go.

15:02.973 --> 15:05.072
[beep]

15:05.108 --> 15:07.108
And you don't have to stamp
a return date in the book?

15:07.176 --> 15:08.543
No.

15:08.578 --> 15:10.745
<i>No, patrons check the due dates</i>
<i>online now, silly.</i>

15:10.780 --> 15:12.914
That's not very cinematic,
is it?

15:12.949 --> 15:14.248
Hey.

15:14.283 --> 15:15.817
Hi.

15:15.852 --> 15:17.785
That's her.

15:17.821 --> 15:19.787
Aurora Teagarden.

15:19.823 --> 15:22.323
I'm so happy to meet you.

15:22.358 --> 15:23.224
Hi.

15:23.292 --> 15:24.659
Ro, this is Celia Shaw.

15:24.694 --> 15:25.793
I'm playing you.

15:25.829 --> 15:27.294
Well, movie you.

15:27.363 --> 15:29.196
What do you think?

15:29.232 --> 15:30.999
Do I look the part?

15:31.034 --> 15:32.967
[beep]

15:33.003 --> 15:34.435
Sure.

15:34.470 --> 15:37.304
I'm checking out some of Robin's
books for my trailer.

15:37.340 --> 15:40.141
You think I would have read one
when we were going out.

15:40.176 --> 15:42.109
Oh, you two dated?

15:42.145 --> 15:43.778
Just for a couple months.

15:43.813 --> 15:47.649
Coincidentally, Celia got the
role while they were dating.

15:47.684 --> 15:49.383
You're only saying that
because you're jealous

15:49.419 --> 15:51.052
you didn't get the part.

15:51.087 --> 15:54.789
Aurora, this is Meredith.
She plays the reporter.

15:54.824 --> 15:58.392
The librarian's best friend.

15:58.428 --> 16:00.662
Oh. Let me guess,
based on Sally?

16:00.697 --> 16:01.963
Yeah.

16:01.998 --> 16:03.531
Hey, why don't you come by
the production office?

16:03.567 --> 16:05.533
I'll give you a copy
of the script.

16:05.569 --> 16:07.635
Oh, I'm not sure
I wanna read it.

16:07.671 --> 16:09.604
Oh, but you have to.

16:09.639 --> 16:11.072
Then we can talk and you can
give me insight

16:11.107 --> 16:12.540
into my character.

16:12.576 --> 16:14.943
Can you show me how you do
your research?

16:17.948 --> 16:19.914
Stupid heels.

16:23.019 --> 16:24.719
I didn't mean for you to get
dragged into helping

16:24.754 --> 16:26.220
on this production.

16:26.255 --> 16:28.623
Celia, she just wants to do
a good job.

16:28.658 --> 16:30.491
Yeah, ok.

16:47.644 --> 16:49.043
You should have seen it.

16:49.079 --> 16:52.413
It was so obvious she had
no idea what she was doing.

16:52.448 --> 16:54.949
But it's not my job to tell her
how to do her job.

16:55.018 --> 16:56.718
[laughs]

16:56.753 --> 16:58.987
It was so ridiculous.

17:07.597 --> 17:08.561
Hi.

17:08.598 --> 17:10.832
Are you the receptionist?

17:10.867 --> 17:13.501
No, I'm Ellen Post.

17:13.536 --> 17:14.836
Producer?

17:14.904 --> 17:16.369
This is my production.

17:16.405 --> 17:18.339
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:18.374 --> 17:19.674
I'm Aurora Teagarden.

17:19.709 --> 17:20.340
Oh.

17:20.376 --> 17:21.675
The Aurora Teagarden.

17:21.744 --> 17:23.144
Yeah, I guess.

17:23.212 --> 17:25.579
I came by to see
Robin Daniels?

17:25.615 --> 17:27.314
Well, he's uh, just finishing
off a meeting

17:27.349 --> 17:29.817
but you're more than welcome
to wait for him over there,

17:29.886 --> 17:30.484
Miss Teagarden.

17:30.553 --> 17:32.120
Thank you.

17:32.188 --> 17:33.487
Perry.

17:33.523 --> 17:34.889
Are you here to write
another story for the paper?

17:34.958 --> 17:35.757
Yeah, sorta.

17:35.792 --> 17:36.658
I'm waiting for Arthur.

17:36.693 --> 17:38.126
Arthur?

17:38.161 --> 17:39.727
Wha- what's he doing here?

17:39.763 --> 17:41.963
Oh, they hired him as a
consultant for the cop scenes.

17:41.998 --> 17:44.165
He's supposed to help me
with my part.

17:44.233 --> 17:45.633
You're gonna be a cop?

17:45.702 --> 17:47.769
Two scenes. I've even got
a line in one.

17:47.837 --> 17:48.703
Hey, what's so funny?

17:48.738 --> 17:50.471
No, nothing.

17:50.506 --> 17:53.141
So even our detectives have been
bitten by the movie bug?

17:53.209 --> 17:54.575
Yeah, pretty cool stuff.

17:54.610 --> 17:56.077
Like this whole craft
service thing.

17:56.146 --> 17:57.545
Have you heard about this?

17:57.613 --> 18:00.214
They keep this constant supply
of food here all the time,

18:00.249 --> 18:01.549
even here at the production
office.

18:01.584 --> 18:02.684
Look.

18:03.853 --> 18:04.919
Wow.

18:04.954 --> 18:07.789
Mmm, those cinnamon rolls
smell good.

18:07.857 --> 18:09.323
Do you mind if I have one?

18:09.358 --> 18:10.624
Oh, please do.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.126
It drives me crazy when
too much food is left over

18:12.162 --> 18:13.561
at the end of the day.

18:14.898 --> 18:18.700
Oh, a Robin Daniels fan?

18:18.768 --> 18:20.467
How'd you know?

18:23.039 --> 18:26.440
Oh, I'm addicted to his books.

18:26.475 --> 18:27.842
It's killing me I haven't been
able to read

18:27.911 --> 18:29.243
"Whimsical Murder" yet.

18:29.278 --> 18:31.245
I'm hoping I get to take a peek
at the script.

18:31.314 --> 18:33.181
I haven't read it, either.

18:33.216 --> 18:34.916
You haven't read the script
inspired by you

18:34.951 --> 18:36.317
in your mind for murder?

18:36.385 --> 18:38.385
Wait, you're her?

18:38.421 --> 18:41.322
The real life crime-solving
librarian?

18:41.357 --> 18:42.890
<i>Yep, that's her.</i>

18:42.926 --> 18:45.492
I have read the script
and there's also a character

18:45.528 --> 18:46.794
based on Sally.

18:46.830 --> 18:48.429
You know, I was a little
offended there wasn't one

18:48.464 --> 18:49.230
based on me.

18:49.265 --> 18:50.431
There isn't a detective?

18:50.466 --> 18:51.465
It is a murder mystery.

18:51.534 --> 18:52.700
Oh, no.

18:52.736 --> 18:55.603
There is, but he's sorta dim,
so, you know,

18:55.638 --> 18:59.207
obviously not me.

18:59.242 --> 19:00.674
Oh hey, speaking of which,

19:00.710 --> 19:01.876
I gotta ask you
about something.

19:01.945 --> 19:04.712
Yeah.

19:04.748 --> 19:05.646
<i>So what's up?</i>

19:05.715 --> 19:06.748
Aurora?

19:06.783 --> 19:08.249
What're you doing here?

19:08.317 --> 19:10.151
I thought you said something
about not being impressed

19:10.186 --> 19:11.986
by all this Hollywood hoopla.

19:12.055 --> 19:17.591
Robin asked me to come by, but
I admit I was a little curious.

19:17.627 --> 19:18.960
My daughter, curious?

19:18.995 --> 19:20.561
How unusual for you.

19:20.596 --> 19:23.464
<i>No! I look ridiculous!</i>

19:23.499 --> 19:24.866
That horrible wardrobe woman
is trying

19:24.934 --> 19:27.301
to make people laugh at me.

19:27.370 --> 19:29.237
Celia, please.
Just calm--

19:29.272 --> 19:31.105
Don't yell at me.

19:31.141 --> 19:32.406
I bet you she's the one.

19:32.441 --> 19:33.607
The one that's been watching me
through my window.

19:33.643 --> 19:34.942
It's ok. It's ok.

19:34.978 --> 19:37.211
<i>Celia, look. Look</i>
<i>at this picture, ok?</i>

19:37.247 --> 19:39.413
See how gorgeous you look?

19:39.448 --> 19:41.615
Oh.

19:41.651 --> 19:45.319
I thought it was
a different colour.

19:45.354 --> 19:47.354
Silly me.

19:47.423 --> 19:49.090
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

19:49.125 --> 19:51.058
See what I'm dealing with?

19:51.928 --> 19:53.995
<i>So, are we happy?</i>

19:54.030 --> 19:54.728
<i>(Celia): Yes.</i>

19:54.764 --> 19:55.830
<i>Good.</i>

19:55.899 --> 19:57.098
Aida!

19:57.133 --> 19:58.900
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

19:58.935 --> 19:59.733
Hello, Aurora.

19:59.803 --> 20:01.102
Hi.

20:01.137 --> 20:03.637
Oh, I just dropped by to go over
the location photos.

20:03.706 --> 20:04.772
That would be perfect.

20:04.841 --> 20:06.207
I... I just need a moment.

20:06.242 --> 20:07.341
Can you wait?

20:07.376 --> 20:08.609
Sure, of course.

20:08.644 --> 20:10.111
Excellent, thank you.
Good to see you, Aurora.

20:10.146 --> 20:10.644
Sure you're ok?

20:10.713 --> 20:12.346
Will?

20:12.381 --> 20:13.181
Yes, sir.

20:13.216 --> 20:15.449
Ellen, come on upstairs.

20:15.484 --> 20:17.084
He's mad at me, isn't he?

20:17.120 --> 20:18.786
He'll get over it.

20:18.855 --> 20:20.922
Someone really has been
watching me.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.556
<i>Why doesn't anyone</i>
<i>believe me?</i>

20:23.526 --> 20:25.559
You're done for the day,
right?

20:25.594 --> 20:28.863
Why don't you and I go grab
a coffee or something?

20:28.898 --> 20:30.464
That sounds nice.

20:30.499 --> 20:31.265
Ok.

20:31.301 --> 20:32.967
I'll just go change.

20:38.942 --> 20:41.709
Actresses can be temperamental.

20:41.744 --> 20:44.611
Well, I don't think that was
normal actress behaviour.

20:44.647 --> 20:45.913
I hope not.

20:45.949 --> 20:47.215
It wasn't.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.416
Everyone knows Celia's
gonna ruin this movie.

20:49.485 --> 20:50.852
Everyone.

20:50.887 --> 20:53.587
Just wonder when someone's
gonna do something about it.

21:10.643 --> 21:12.274
Oh, I drove by that house,
the new listing,

21:12.325 --> 21:13.590
I really liked it.

21:13.626 --> 21:15.126
And if I can drag
my mother away

21:15.161 --> 21:16.928
from her location
scouting tomorrow

21:16.963 --> 21:19.797
do you wanna come by
and see it with us?

21:20.700 --> 21:21.465
Hello?

21:21.500 --> 21:22.333
Oh.

21:22.401 --> 21:23.267
Where'd you go?

21:23.303 --> 21:25.069
I'm sorry, I'll come back.

21:25.104 --> 21:27.839
Are you still worried
about Rex?

21:27.874 --> 21:31.042
I worked along side him
for years.

21:31.077 --> 21:33.677
He seemed indestructible.

21:33.713 --> 21:34.946
I find it really difficult
to believe

21:34.981 --> 21:36.981
that he could have
been kidnapped.

21:37.016 --> 21:38.850
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:38.885 --> 21:41.352
I'm trying not to obsess
about it.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.353
You?

21:42.388 --> 21:43.687
Obsession's your middle name.

21:43.756 --> 21:46.623
And it should be your first name
and your last name.

21:46.692 --> 21:49.626
Just tell me what you're
up to today.

21:49.662 --> 21:52.296
Well, today's the first day
of shooting "Whimsical Murder",

21:52.332 --> 21:53.898
so I told Robin I'd stop
by the set

21:53.933 --> 21:56.334
and give him my thoughts
on the script.

21:56.369 --> 21:58.402
Which are?

21:58.437 --> 21:59.636
Robin's a really good writer

21:59.705 --> 22:01.906
but this mystery
isn't a very good one.

22:01.941 --> 22:03.640
I figured out right
in the beginning

22:03.676 --> 22:05.943
that the son-in-law
was the murderer.

22:05.979 --> 22:08.212
Well, you are kinda special
that way.

22:08.248 --> 22:11.215
Yeah, but then the ending, the
killer confronts the librarian

22:11.284 --> 22:14.852
in this old abandoned mine
and she's just so passive.

22:14.888 --> 22:16.754
I see.

22:16.822 --> 22:21.859
Well, you are anything
but passive, Miss Teagarden.

22:38.577 --> 22:39.676
[knocking]

22:39.712 --> 22:41.045
<i>Come in.</i>

22:44.617 --> 22:47.018
Oh, uh... sorry to interrupt.

22:47.053 --> 22:50.454
I just wanted to...
I'll come back later.

22:53.092 --> 22:54.058
So it's true?

22:54.127 --> 22:55.526
You hang out with Celia
last night?

22:55.594 --> 22:57.895
Only 'til 11:00.
We were just talking.

22:57.931 --> 22:59.230
<i>And drinking, I'm sure.</i>

22:59.265 --> 23:00.064
No, no.

23:00.099 --> 23:01.465
Celia doesn't drink.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.200
Then why can't she ever
remember her lines?

23:03.269 --> 23:05.937
Why does she have to rehearse
every scene over and over?

23:05.972 --> 23:07.638
Because I'm a professional
and I like to rehearse

23:07.673 --> 23:11.976
every scene until
I get it perfect.

23:12.045 --> 23:15.546
Celia, honey, you know I didn't
mean anything by that, right?

23:15.581 --> 23:17.348
I'll go tell Joel you're ready
to run some lines.

23:17.383 --> 23:18.449
Thank you.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.616
I was just uh...

23:19.652 --> 23:20.717
Excuse me, Miss Shaw?

23:20.753 --> 23:21.986
Perry Dell from
the "Lawrenceton Times."

23:22.021 --> 23:23.321
I was wondering if
you have a minute,

23:23.356 --> 23:23.988
maybe I can get an interview?

23:24.023 --> 23:25.089
I'm sorry, I don't.

23:25.124 --> 23:27.391
Maybe today after
we're done shooting?

23:29.528 --> 23:31.628
That whole "I'm a professional"
thing?

23:31.664 --> 23:34.065
That was real acting.

23:34.100 --> 23:35.699
You can interview me
if you want.

23:35.734 --> 23:36.834
<i>Hey, Perry.</i>

23:36.869 --> 23:38.369
You ready for those
handcuff lessons?

23:38.438 --> 23:39.503
Yeah.

23:39.538 --> 23:41.305
I'll catch you later, ok?

23:42.475 --> 23:43.707
Ok.

23:59.859 --> 24:01.158
Oh, hey Taylor.

24:01.194 --> 24:03.527
I'm looking for Robin Daniels,
have you seen him?

24:03.562 --> 24:05.396
I wish.

24:05.431 --> 24:07.298
Oh, do you have any
of those cinnamon rolls?

24:07.333 --> 24:08.966
No, but how about some
banana bread?

24:09.002 --> 24:10.234
Oh.

24:11.270 --> 24:12.436
Yeah.

24:14.773 --> 24:17.641
You're friends with Robin,
aren't you?

24:17.710 --> 24:20.844
Uh, mostly email friends now,
but yeah.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.779
Do you think you could
introduce me?

24:22.815 --> 24:24.615
I mean, I've met him sort of.

24:24.650 --> 24:26.384
I've given him his lunch
twice now,

24:26.419 --> 24:27.684
but I haven't met him,
met him.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.220
Oh, sure.

24:29.288 --> 24:31.088
I bet he'd be really happy
to know that you're-

24:31.124 --> 24:32.556
<i>Celia!</i>

24:35.561 --> 24:36.994
A big fan of his.

24:37.030 --> 24:39.563
Thanks. I really wanna get him
to sign my book.

24:39.598 --> 24:41.232
[phone ringing]

24:41.267 --> 24:43.067
Oh, speak of the devil.

24:43.136 --> 24:43.934
<i>Celia!</i>

24:43.969 --> 24:45.569
Hey, Robin.

24:45.604 --> 24:48.039
Yeah, I'm at Craft Services.

24:48.074 --> 24:50.408
Uh-huh. Ok, I'll wait.

24:51.810 --> 24:55.779
Oh, um... ok, if Robin gets here
before I come back

24:55.848 --> 24:57.748
will you tell him I'm running
to my car to get the script?

24:57.783 --> 24:59.050
Yeah, of course.

24:59.118 --> 25:00.117
Ok.

25:03.389 --> 25:07.458
No, you wanna bring it down
with a snap, ok?

25:07.493 --> 25:08.659
Like this.

25:08.727 --> 25:09.360
Oh.

25:09.395 --> 25:10.594
Yeah.

25:10.663 --> 25:12.229
<i>It's harder than it looks.</i>

25:13.332 --> 25:14.131
Hey, Arthur?

25:14.167 --> 25:15.933
Yeah.

25:15.968 --> 25:19.636
Say you're trying to cuff him
and he tries to bolt.

25:19.672 --> 25:21.338
Well, you try to avoid that
by getting a feel

25:21.374 --> 25:22.940
for whether the suspect
is cooperating.

25:22.975 --> 25:25.176
If not, you wanna get him down
on the ground first,

25:25.211 --> 25:26.077
then cuff him.

25:26.145 --> 25:27.178
Right.

25:27.213 --> 25:28.412
Ok, but say he tries
to bolt anyway.

25:28.448 --> 25:30.581
Then what, do you
chase him down?

25:30.616 --> 25:31.415
Draw your weapon?

25:31.451 --> 25:32.583
What?

25:32.618 --> 25:33.917
I only draw my weapon
as a last resort.

25:33.986 --> 25:35.219
Why do you ask?

25:35.288 --> 25:37.388
Well, I have this script
I'm trying to direct.

25:37.423 --> 25:40.091
Yeah, and I have
a cop character.

25:40.159 --> 25:41.725
Oh, just one sec.

25:41.794 --> 25:43.360
Yeah, go for it. Will.

25:43.429 --> 25:44.962
Done like a pro.

25:44.997 --> 25:48.699
Well, not exactly.

25:48.734 --> 25:49.533
Copy that.

25:49.602 --> 25:50.101
Sorry.

25:50.136 --> 25:51.268
Yeah.

25:51.304 --> 25:53.237
Everett? Joel needs you for,
uh, blocking.

25:53.272 --> 25:54.338
Ok.

25:54.373 --> 25:55.406
Oh, no, I'm gonna...
there we go.

25:55.475 --> 25:56.440
Alright, here we go.

25:56.476 --> 25:57.608
Thanks.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.643
Ok buddy, scene's not
'til after lunch.

26:02.081 --> 26:04.047
Hey, who's he playing?

26:06.285 --> 26:07.384
Detective Jones.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.052
Oh. The one based
on me?

26:13.159 --> 26:15.759
Yeah, that's you.

26:15.794 --> 26:17.027
Ok, let's do some more work
on those handcuffs.

26:17.062 --> 26:19.696
And get it right this time.

26:19.765 --> 26:22.032
You just arrested yourself,
so...

26:25.004 --> 26:26.337
<i>First day of shooting</i>

26:26.372 --> 26:28.071
<i>and we're already an hour</i>
<i>behind schedule.</i>

26:28.107 --> 26:29.906
Guess who's fault that is.

26:29.942 --> 26:31.708
You know, my mother
always said

26:31.744 --> 26:34.645
jealousy is not a very
attractive quality.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.515
Well, my mother always
told me to tell the truth.

26:37.550 --> 26:40.484
[phone ringing]

26:40.520 --> 26:41.252
Hi.

26:41.287 --> 26:42.319
Wait, Robin, I'm supposed-

26:42.355 --> 26:44.121
Yeah, scene 67.

26:46.225 --> 26:47.791
Good with the shot? Alright.

26:47.826 --> 26:50.127
Will, can you give Celia
the 10-minute warning, please?

26:50.163 --> 26:51.695
Yes, sir.

26:51.730 --> 26:52.596
No, no.

26:52.665 --> 26:53.730
No, no, no.

26:53.799 --> 26:54.798
We already budgeted
for those flowers

26:54.833 --> 26:56.833
for the wedding scene.

26:56.902 --> 26:58.969
Well, I don't care if
they're not in season.

26:59.038 --> 27:00.571
Oh, Lynn.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.873
Hey. Looking for Arthur?

27:02.941 --> 27:04.975
And I should be telling
you this why?

27:05.044 --> 27:07.178
I'm just making conversation.

27:07.213 --> 27:08.845
Sorry.

27:08.881 --> 27:09.647
That's ok.

27:09.682 --> 27:10.981
How's the baby?

27:11.016 --> 27:12.449
The baby's fine.

27:12.485 --> 27:14.285
This movie production is giving
me all sorts of headaches.

27:14.353 --> 27:15.986
Parking problems,
traffic issues.

27:16.021 --> 27:17.054
I get it.

27:17.122 --> 27:19.657
It must be hard to be
chief of police.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.058
It's nothing I can't handle,

27:21.093 --> 27:23.026
I just need to find the producer
of this whole circus.

27:23.062 --> 27:24.061
What's her name?

27:24.129 --> 27:25.962
Ellen Post.

27:27.266 --> 27:28.699
Oh, there's Robin.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.634
I'm sure he can help you
find her.

27:36.442 --> 27:37.675
Help!

27:37.710 --> 27:39.376
Somebody help!

27:39.445 --> 27:40.911
<i>Something's wrong</i>
<i>with Celia!</i>

27:40.946 --> 27:41.812
Call 911!

27:41.880 --> 27:44.215
Step aside! Police!

27:58.831 --> 28:00.997
She's dead.

28:10.766 --> 28:12.753
It's an actress
from the movie.

28:12.807 --> 28:14.507
No, I don't know
which one.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.308
Celia Shaw.

28:16.377 --> 28:17.910
<i>Celia Shaw.</i>

28:19.380 --> 28:20.479
Ro.

28:21.215 --> 28:22.581
Ro.

28:22.617 --> 28:25.283
You need to leave
my crime scene.

28:31.058 --> 28:33.993
I need a forensics team
out here right away.

28:35.029 --> 28:35.694
I need to check her pulse.

28:35.730 --> 28:38.096
I'm sorry. She's gone.

28:42.369 --> 28:43.669
What happened?

28:43.704 --> 28:46.238
Robin, Celia's dead.

28:46.273 --> 28:48.807
I think someone murdered her.

28:48.843 --> 28:50.776
What?

28:50.811 --> 28:52.411
What'd you do to her?

28:52.446 --> 28:53.078
Huh?

28:53.113 --> 28:53.646
What'd you do to her?

28:53.714 --> 28:54.379
Hey!

28:54.415 --> 28:55.047
Hey!

28:55.082 --> 28:55.848
What'd you do?!

28:55.883 --> 28:56.481
What did you do to her?!

28:56.517 --> 28:57.315
Back off!

28:57.351 --> 28:58.316
He did something to her!

28:58.352 --> 28:59.552
He did something!

28:59.587 --> 29:01.119
He was jealous that Celia wanted
me and not him!

29:01.188 --> 29:02.320
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

29:02.356 --> 29:03.388
You're crazy.

29:03.424 --> 29:04.723
You.

29:04.792 --> 29:05.791
You need to calm down
right now so you can help us

29:05.826 --> 29:06.792
figure out what happened
to your friend.

29:06.827 --> 29:08.393
Can you do that?

29:09.530 --> 29:10.529
Good.

29:10.565 --> 29:11.697
You're gonna go
with Detective Smith

29:11.732 --> 29:13.666
and you're gonna answer
his questions.

29:13.734 --> 29:15.534
Come on, let's go.

29:16.837 --> 29:18.470
You are gonna go sit by
the food table

29:18.505 --> 29:20.472
where we can see you
and don't move

29:20.507 --> 29:23.075
until we have a chance
to talk to you.

29:26.614 --> 29:28.781
Ro, I need you to sit tight
until we have a chance

29:28.816 --> 29:30.215
to get your statement.

29:30.250 --> 29:33.719
And please, please at least
try to stay out of our way.

29:34.755 --> 29:36.321
Hey.

29:37.792 --> 29:39.925
Are you ok?

29:39.961 --> 29:42.194
Yeah, I'm ok.

29:44.699 --> 29:45.564
I just heard.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.765
I can't believe it.

29:46.834 --> 29:48.601
The lead actress on this movie
was murdered

29:48.636 --> 29:49.602
in broad daylight?

29:49.637 --> 29:50.736
Yeah.

29:50.771 --> 29:52.437
And apparently all kinds
of people saw her

29:52.473 --> 29:54.372
less than an hour before.

29:54.408 --> 29:55.608
Do you think that means...

29:55.643 --> 29:59.078
Somebody on this movie
probably killed her.

30:01.482 --> 30:02.982
This is horrible.

30:03.017 --> 30:05.317
I'm just stunned.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.553
I guess we're just gonna have to
shut down production for now.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.288
Of course, of course.

30:10.324 --> 30:12.157
I just- I don't wanna lose
the crew, right?

30:12.226 --> 30:14.693
No. No, of course not.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.895
Look, it's hard to even imagine
going on

30:16.964 --> 30:18.964
but our investors are gonna
want us to get back

30:19.000 --> 30:20.933
as soon as we can.

30:22.837 --> 30:24.036
Hey, Perry.

30:24.071 --> 30:26.338
I need you to write down
everything you have seen

30:26.406 --> 30:28.306
and heard today on the set, ok?

30:28.375 --> 30:29.508
Even if you think it's small.

30:29.543 --> 30:30.475
Got it.

30:30.511 --> 30:31.610
It's just so unfair.

30:31.646 --> 30:33.812
She was so sweet.

30:34.481 --> 30:35.547
What's with her?

30:35.582 --> 30:37.182
She must have been close
to the victim.

30:37.217 --> 30:39.985
That's the thing, she couldn't
stand Celia.

30:40.021 --> 30:41.920
Wait, I saw her knocking
at the door.

30:41.956 --> 30:43.255
That's why you need
to write this all down.

30:43.290 --> 30:45.991
These are all clues
as to how Celia died.

30:46.827 --> 30:48.727
Hey, did you see?
I talked to Robin Daniels.

30:48.763 --> 30:49.762
I gave him some chamomile tea.

30:49.797 --> 30:51.764
It's really soothing.

30:51.832 --> 30:53.298
Ok, that's great.

30:53.333 --> 30:55.834
Listen, do you remember giving
me banana bread?

30:55.903 --> 30:57.302
Yeah.

30:57.371 --> 30:59.504
I need to know, did you see
Meredith actually go inside

30:59.540 --> 31:01.674
Celia's trailer
around that time?

31:01.709 --> 31:02.941
Remember we saw
her knocking.

31:02.977 --> 31:04.643
Yeah, I remember seeing
her knocking.

31:04.712 --> 31:07.546
But you didn't see
her actually go inside?

31:07.581 --> 31:09.014
No.

31:11.285 --> 31:14.787
I thought you agreed
to stay out of the way.

31:14.822 --> 31:16.021
I was just asking-

31:16.057 --> 31:18.757
We will question the witnesses,
not all of you.

31:18.793 --> 31:21.560
Ro, I think it's time
for you to go.

31:21.595 --> 31:23.062
But I thought you told me
to stay-

31:23.130 --> 31:24.563
Arthur will come and track you
down as soon as he's ready.

31:24.598 --> 31:25.898
Go home.

31:25.933 --> 31:27.199
Madam Mayor.

31:27.234 --> 31:29.501
Chief, I'd like to get an update
on the situation.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.604
Kicked off the set, huh?

31:32.639 --> 31:34.339
Keep your eyes and ears
open today.

31:34.374 --> 31:36.175
You know it.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.914
Gotta go.

31:43.483 --> 31:45.184
I don't know,
about half an hour.

31:45.219 --> 31:47.285
I was in the car on the phone
with my publisher

31:47.321 --> 31:49.888
talking about an option clause
in the contract.

31:49.924 --> 31:52.825
Do you normally conduct calls
with your agent in your car?

31:52.860 --> 31:54.292
No, no.

31:54.328 --> 31:56.128
That's just where I happen
to have a copy of the contract.

31:56.197 --> 31:59.231
Ok, well I will have to confirm
that with your agent.

31:59.299 --> 32:00.498
Absolutely.

32:00.534 --> 32:02.601
Listen, um, we'll probably have
more questions.

32:02.636 --> 32:03.936
I'm sure I don't have
to tell you,

32:04.004 --> 32:05.738
don't leave town.

32:05.806 --> 32:07.139
I'll be here.

32:07.174 --> 32:10.442
Listen, even though Celia and I
only dated a few weeks,

32:10.477 --> 32:12.144
I really cared about her.

32:12.179 --> 32:13.779
I don't know why Will said
what he said.

32:13.814 --> 32:17.315
I just wanted her to be happy.

32:17.384 --> 32:19.051
Yeah.

32:26.761 --> 32:30.028
So you were in Celia's trailer
together at 9:45,

32:30.064 --> 32:31.130
are you sure about
the time?

32:31.165 --> 32:32.464
Yeah, I was keeping track
of the time

32:32.532 --> 32:33.866
because we were
running behind.

32:33.901 --> 32:35.567
Yeah, and you even spilled
coffee on your sleeve

32:35.636 --> 32:36.769
when you handed it to her.

32:36.804 --> 32:38.137
Right.

32:38.172 --> 32:39.704
We just wanted to go over
a scene that we were gonna

32:39.740 --> 32:41.306
shoot later on in the day and
then I had to get back to set.

32:41.341 --> 32:43.341
You were with Celia
for how long?

32:43.377 --> 32:45.644
Fifteen minutes? Twenty, tops?

32:45.712 --> 32:47.045
How did she seem to you?

32:47.081 --> 32:48.881
Same as always.

32:48.916 --> 32:50.783
A lot of nervous laughter,
you know?

32:50.818 --> 32:52.350
Celia had insecurities.

32:52.386 --> 32:53.886
She required a lot
of hand-holding.

32:53.921 --> 32:55.187
But then most actors do.

32:55.222 --> 32:56.822
I even had her in my trailer

32:56.857 --> 32:58.490
just to calm her
first day jitters.

32:58.525 --> 33:00.325
So nothing seemed
out of the ordinary

33:00.394 --> 33:03.095
during your time with her?

33:03.164 --> 33:04.329
No.

33:04.364 --> 33:05.798
She mention any calls
or anyone she planned

33:05.833 --> 33:06.832
to meet up with
or talk to?

33:06.901 --> 33:08.400
No, it was pretty much
run of the mill.

33:08.435 --> 33:10.102
We ran the lines
and then we told her

33:10.171 --> 33:12.537
we'd see her back on set.

33:12.606 --> 33:14.506
I assume you have a list of
all the cast and crew members

33:14.574 --> 33:15.774
who were on set today?

33:15.810 --> 33:16.741
I do.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.844
Please, follow me.

33:22.983 --> 33:25.150
Joel, I came as soon
as I heard.

33:25.186 --> 33:26.518
I am so sorry.

33:26.553 --> 33:27.619
Is there anything I can do?

33:27.654 --> 33:29.154
I don't know what happened.

33:29.223 --> 33:31.890
I mean, she was literally
20 feet away

33:31.926 --> 33:33.292
from dozens of people.

33:33.327 --> 33:36.728
Oh, my heart breaks for
that poor girl and her family.

33:36.763 --> 33:37.930
Yeah.

33:37.965 --> 33:39.865
And of course for you
and your lovely movie-

33:39.900 --> 33:42.334
Thank you, but you know, this
is not a sentimental business

33:42.369 --> 33:45.570
and we'll probably halt
production for a few days

33:45.605 --> 33:47.339
and see what we can do
for Celia's family

33:47.374 --> 33:49.942
but the movie will go on.

33:49.977 --> 33:52.444
I don't see how it could
without your lead actress.

33:52.512 --> 33:54.746
Oh, we'd just re-cast.

33:54.815 --> 33:55.714
Oh.

33:55.782 --> 33:57.682
Hey, speaking of which,
sit down.

33:57.751 --> 33:59.218
You gotta see this.

33:59.253 --> 34:00.752
Did I show you the person I
cast as the librarian's mother?

34:00.821 --> 34:01.686
No.

34:01.722 --> 34:03.155
Look at this.

34:03.190 --> 34:08.493
As soon as I met you I knew
I had to cast a real beauty.

34:08.527 --> 34:10.395
Thank you.

34:10.464 --> 34:12.965
I think it's a perfect fit.

34:25.445 --> 34:26.610
Hey.

34:26.646 --> 34:27.645
Your mother called to tell me
what happened

34:27.714 --> 34:28.847
down at the movie set.

34:28.882 --> 34:29.848
Are you alright?

34:29.884 --> 34:31.483
Yeah, I'm- I'm fine.

34:31.518 --> 34:33.985
I'm just- I'm worried
about Robin.

34:34.021 --> 34:35.087
Robin?

34:35.121 --> 34:37.989
Well, he is so upset
about all of this.

34:38.025 --> 34:42.226
Well, uh, you don't seem
fine yourself.

34:42.263 --> 34:44.263
Well, it's very unsettling.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.664
Not only was someone killed
but that someone was supposed

34:46.699 --> 34:49.134
to play a character
based on me.

34:49.168 --> 34:51.835
Yeah, I read the script.

34:51.871 --> 34:54.539
It's all fiction, right?

34:54.608 --> 34:56.275
Oh, you mean the ending?

34:56.310 --> 34:58.110
Yeah.

34:58.178 --> 35:00.412
The handsome mystery writer
based on Robin

35:00.480 --> 35:03.748
falls in love with the beautiful
librarian based on you,

35:03.784 --> 35:06.118
and he asks her to marry him?

35:06.186 --> 35:08.887
Martin, it is definitely
fiction.

35:08.956 --> 35:10.923
Robin and I went out a few times
and we laughed

35:10.958 --> 35:12.690
but it was never serious.

35:12.726 --> 35:14.960
It was never love.

35:14.995 --> 35:18.297
You are the only man
I have ever loved.

35:19.800 --> 35:20.933
Oh.

35:21.001 --> 35:22.968
Stay for dinner?

35:23.003 --> 35:24.970
I'd love to.

35:28.575 --> 35:30.142
I hope Martin enjoyed dinner.

35:30.177 --> 35:32.311
He seemed a little distracted.

35:32.346 --> 35:36.881
Well, one of his best friends
from his CIA days went missing.

35:36.917 --> 35:40.085
That's terrible.
He must be frantic.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.688
He's very concerned, but
Martin doesn't do frantic,

35:43.723 --> 35:47.225
and he's doing all he can
to help from here.

35:47.261 --> 35:50.195
That man takes care of
the people he loves.

35:50.230 --> 35:52.464
Yes, he does.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.767
Alright darling, I'm gonna go
read my book.

35:55.802 --> 35:57.102
I'll see you in the morning.

35:57.171 --> 35:58.803
What, you don't wanna inspect
my work,

35:58.839 --> 36:00.973
make sure there are no crumbs?

36:01.008 --> 36:03.375
I trust you. Goodnight.

36:03.410 --> 36:05.143
Goodnight.

36:25.033 --> 36:25.887
- Right?
- Right.

36:25.943 --> 36:27.644
Okay, yeah, Joel said he
wants the ropes uh,

36:27.680 --> 36:29.981
in the warehouse scene...

36:34.053 --> 36:35.019
Got any mustard?

36:35.054 --> 36:36.420
Oh, yeah. Over here.

36:36.456 --> 36:38.222
Great.

36:38.257 --> 36:40.124
Perry Dell, are you skulking?

36:40.193 --> 36:43.627
Uh, no, Ms. Teagarden,
I'm reporting.

36:43.662 --> 36:45.396
I'm actually waiting
to interview the director

36:45.431 --> 36:47.231
but a good reporter always keeps
his ear to the ground,

36:47.266 --> 36:48.699
if you know what I mean.

36:48.734 --> 36:51.402
You've clearly been around
my daughter too much.

36:51.437 --> 36:54.771
You Real Murders Club people
always skulk.

36:56.709 --> 36:58.509
<i>I've told Joel ten times now.</i>

36:58.577 --> 37:00.978
I know all Adelaide's lines,
I could do the part.

37:01.047 --> 37:02.813
If he would just let me do
one scene, he'd see.

37:02.848 --> 37:04.515
Give it up already.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.683
This is why you're never gonna
make it big and I am.

37:06.719 --> 37:08.386
Because I never give up.

37:13.993 --> 37:15.592
[message alert]

37:20.199 --> 37:22.233
Press conference?

37:22.268 --> 37:23.934
Yes.

37:37.683 --> 37:39.050
Excuse me.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.319
Robin, what're you
doing here?

37:42.355 --> 37:44.388
Arthur asked me to come by
and sign my statement

37:44.424 --> 37:45.822
when I had a moment.

37:45.858 --> 37:47.191
Looks like I picked
the worst time, though.

37:47.226 --> 37:48.592
Anyone here for
the press conference,

37:48.627 --> 37:50.961
right this way please.

37:50.996 --> 37:52.896
Or the best time.

37:52.932 --> 37:54.131
Thank you.

37:55.634 --> 37:56.867
Thank you.

37:59.405 --> 38:01.638
Ah, no press credentials,
no entry.

38:01.674 --> 38:03.107
No, isn't the public
supposed to-

38:03.142 --> 38:03.974
Press only.

38:04.009 --> 38:05.543
Thank you, Perry.
Go ahead.

38:05.578 --> 38:07.545
Ok, yep.

38:07.580 --> 38:08.979
Sorry.

38:12.985 --> 38:14.351
Alright.

38:14.387 --> 38:16.253
I know another door.

38:18.824 --> 38:20.291
<i>Alright, everyone.</i>
<i>Let's settle.</i>

38:20.326 --> 38:22.025
<i>We're gonna get started.</i>

38:29.402 --> 38:31.235
<i>The coroner has ruled</i>
<i>the official cause</i>

38:31.304 --> 38:33.737
<i>of Miss Shaw's death</i>
<i>to be cardiac arrest</i>

38:33.772 --> 38:37.174
from a lethal dose of the
sleeping medication Sonazepam.

38:37.810 --> 38:38.542
Excuse me.

38:38.578 --> 38:39.843
Yes, Perry?

38:39.878 --> 38:41.645
Uh, so you're saying it wasn't
murder after all?

38:41.714 --> 38:43.514
She just overdosed on
her own sleeping pills?

38:43.549 --> 38:46.350
No, we found high amounts of
the drug in her coffee cup

38:46.385 --> 38:48.952
which lead us to believe she was
ingesting it unknowingly.

38:48.988 --> 38:51.222
She also suffered blunt force
trauma to the head

38:51.257 --> 38:53.457
from a crystal lamp
which we found at her feet.

38:53.493 --> 38:55.326
The blow was most
likely post-mortem.

38:55.361 --> 38:56.393
Wait.

38:56.429 --> 38:58.429
Yes, Perry? Again?

38:58.498 --> 39:00.631
So someone tried to kill her
two different ways?

39:00.666 --> 39:02.333
That's correct.

39:02.368 --> 39:03.967
<i>It appears the assailant wanted</i>
<i>to make sure</i>

39:04.036 --> 39:06.003
<i>the victim was truly dead.</i>

39:06.038 --> 39:08.172
<i>This action will inform the</i>
<i>psychological profile that-</i>

39:08.207 --> 39:09.673
Did she just say that Celia
was killed by something

39:09.742 --> 39:11.442
in her coffee?

39:11.477 --> 39:14.178
I thought it was trauma
to the head.

39:14.213 --> 39:16.380
Actually, both.

39:16.415 --> 39:17.114
What?

39:17.150 --> 39:18.649
Oh, Arthur, I'm sorry.

39:18.717 --> 39:19.183
I know-

39:19.218 --> 39:20.284
Shh. It's ok.

39:20.353 --> 39:21.352
<i>What about physical evidence?</i>

39:21.387 --> 39:22.786
<i>Things left at the scene?</i>

39:22.821 --> 39:24.588
Fingerprints, things
of that nature?

39:24.624 --> 39:26.857
We have found fingerprints
in Miss Shaw's trailer

39:26.892 --> 39:28.659
that belonged to
several individuals

39:28.694 --> 39:29.960
connected with
the production.

39:29.995 --> 39:31.462
We're still in the process
of figuring out exactly

39:31.497 --> 39:32.663
where each of them
came from.

39:32.731 --> 39:34.398
Yes, Perry?

39:34.433 --> 39:37.434
Oh, I bet they find fingerprints
from Joel Parker

39:37.470 --> 39:39.002
and Ellen Post.

39:39.071 --> 39:40.937
I'd lay money on Will Weir,
too.

39:40.973 --> 39:43.174
I think that's why he was trying
to point the finger at me,

39:43.209 --> 39:46.277
take suspicion off of himself.

39:46.312 --> 39:49.112
Arthur, why are you standing
here with us and not up

39:49.182 --> 39:50.514
at the podium with Lynn?

39:50.550 --> 39:52.449
Yeah, aren't you supposed to be
the lead investigator

39:52.485 --> 39:53.250
on this case?

39:53.286 --> 39:55.752
I um, had to recuse myself.

39:55.788 --> 39:57.555
What? Why?

39:57.590 --> 39:59.856
Well, one because I was being
paid by the movie production

39:59.925 --> 40:02.626
as a consultant and two
because my prints

40:02.695 --> 40:04.061
were also found
in Celia's trailer.

40:04.096 --> 40:08.232
I went in to ask her for an
autograph...for my sister.

40:08.267 --> 40:10.701
Oh, I bet Lynn wasn't too happy
about that.

40:10.736 --> 40:13.970
No, she wasn't.
She really wasn't.

40:14.006 --> 40:16.540
Thank you, that is all
for now.

40:21.013 --> 40:23.080
It's kinda like old times,
isn't it?

40:23.115 --> 40:25.349
Us turning up clues.

40:25.384 --> 40:27.184
We made a good team
back then.

40:27.220 --> 40:28.819
Yeah, we did.

40:28.854 --> 40:31.888
And look, I know Vartel makes
you happy and believe me,

40:31.924 --> 40:34.091
that makes me happy.

40:36.128 --> 40:38.629
Oh, Martin, what a surprise.

40:38.664 --> 40:40.598
Arthur, I'd like to share
some information

40:40.666 --> 40:42.233
about Celia Shaw's murder.

40:42.301 --> 40:43.800
Oh, well I'm not working
the case anymore

40:43.836 --> 40:45.636
so you'll have to give
your information to Lynn.

40:45.671 --> 40:47.571
Alright, happy to do that.

40:47.607 --> 40:49.673
You're gonna wanna
hear this, too.

40:55.381 --> 40:57.881
So will this take care
of the permits we need

40:57.950 --> 41:00.251
to be able to shoot in the park
and the library?

41:00.286 --> 41:02.353
It should.

41:02.388 --> 41:04.187
I'm sorry to interrupt your
lunch but I wanted a chance

41:04.223 --> 41:06.624
to assure you that our police
department is working

41:06.659 --> 41:08.592
day and night to find out
what happened to Celia.

41:08.628 --> 41:13.464
And to make sure that your set
will be a safe place to work.

41:13.499 --> 41:14.831
Diana Weldon's agent called,

41:14.900 --> 41:16.867
wants to know if we're
gonna make her an offer today.

41:16.902 --> 41:18.068
It's nearly two.

41:18.137 --> 41:19.936
Two? That means I missed
the press conference.

41:19.972 --> 41:21.905
The one the police did
about Celia?

41:21.940 --> 41:24.241
It was just on
in the break room.

41:24.277 --> 41:25.476
Yeah, it was pretty rough,

41:25.511 --> 41:26.810
the way they were talking
about her.

41:26.845 --> 41:27.678
How she died.

41:27.747 --> 41:29.413
What did they say?

41:29.448 --> 41:33.384
Um, I guess her heart stopped
from too many sleeping pills.

41:33.452 --> 41:34.818
Sleeping pills?

41:34.853 --> 41:35.819
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:35.854 --> 41:37.688
What kind of sleeping pills?

41:37.723 --> 41:40.157
Sonaz... something.

41:42.194 --> 41:43.794
Sonazepam?

41:45.631 --> 41:48.299
They didn't say Sonazepam,
did they?

41:52.237 --> 41:55.406
The sleeping pills
that I keep in my bag.

41:55.441 --> 41:57.308
They're gone.

41:58.177 --> 41:59.310
Ok, I have said all I need
to say about this

41:59.378 --> 42:00.377
at the press conference.

42:00.413 --> 42:02.012
We're looking at a number
of people.

42:02.047 --> 42:04.748
But there's only one person
Celia dumped.

42:04.784 --> 42:07.250
Celia didn't dump me.

42:07.286 --> 42:08.251
It was a mutual parting.

42:08.321 --> 42:09.720
We remained friends afterwards.

42:09.789 --> 42:13.324
I was talking to my CIA contact
about something different.

42:13.392 --> 42:15.926
I had him run a background check
on Robin Daniels.

42:15.994 --> 42:16.694
Why?

42:16.729 --> 42:17.961
And?

42:17.996 --> 42:19.563
It turns out Celia called
the police on Robin

42:19.598 --> 42:21.031
while they were dating.

42:21.066 --> 42:21.865
Martin.

42:21.900 --> 42:23.300
That was a misunderstanding.

42:23.336 --> 42:25.035
It was a pretty big one
if she felt the need

42:25.103 --> 42:25.803
to call the police.

42:25.838 --> 42:27.170
What are you implying?

42:27.239 --> 42:29.206
My point is, Lynn, that Robin
should be at the top

42:29.241 --> 42:30.741
of your suspect list.

42:30.810 --> 42:32.275
Are you kidding?

42:32.311 --> 42:34.945
I think you probably killed
Celia and until we know for sure

42:34.980 --> 42:36.880
I suggest you stay far away
from Aurora.

42:36.915 --> 42:39.149
Ok, Martin, it's not that
I don't appreciate

42:39.184 --> 42:40.851
this information on Robin.

42:40.919 --> 42:43.454
But we already knew about
Celia's call to the cops.

42:43.522 --> 42:47.324
What? I'm here as a concerned
citizen, just like them.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.325
[exhales]

42:48.361 --> 42:50.394
You are not an unbiased source.

42:50.429 --> 42:51.995
Pointing a finger at
your girlfriend's ex-

42:52.030 --> 42:52.830
Woah, woah, woah.

42:52.865 --> 42:54.197
First off, Robin is not my ex

42:54.266 --> 42:55.966
and Martin is not
the jealous type.

42:56.001 --> 42:57.568
I don't think.

42:57.603 --> 42:58.935
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

42:59.004 --> 43:00.904
And Celia was not afraid
of Robin,

43:00.939 --> 43:02.673
I saw them at the library
yesterday

43:02.742 --> 43:03.974
and the way she was
teasing him-

43:04.042 --> 43:06.543
I'm waiting for Robin's agent
to call me back.

43:06.579 --> 43:09.045
If she can verify his alibi
for the half hour

43:09.114 --> 43:10.947
within which we know
the murder took place

43:10.983 --> 43:12.716
and his phone records match,

43:12.752 --> 43:15.318
then his past with Celia is
gonna become a moot point.

43:15.354 --> 43:18.422
Until then, out of my station,
all of you.

43:18.457 --> 43:19.790
That's right.

43:19.859 --> 43:20.557
Especially you.

43:20.593 --> 43:21.892
Yeah.

43:23.295 --> 43:25.562
Listen, I know that
you wanna protect me-

43:25.598 --> 43:27.431
Let's not discuss it here, ok?

43:27.500 --> 43:29.232
We can talk it through
at dinner.

43:29.301 --> 43:34.137
In the meantime, please stay
away from that guy.

43:40.880 --> 43:44.381
Martin's just watching out
for me.

43:44.450 --> 43:46.650
I can respect that.

43:47.820 --> 43:49.720
Hey. It is time for the Real
Murders Club

43:49.755 --> 43:50.521
to get back to work.

43:50.556 --> 43:52.222
You still in?

43:52.291 --> 43:53.757
You bet.

44:05.905 --> 44:08.305
Lynn, wait.

44:10.876 --> 44:12.810
There's something I should
probably tell you

44:12.845 --> 44:14.812
about my alibi.

44:17.834 --> 44:20.154
Perry and I were both on the set
during the time of murder.

44:20.206 --> 44:21.338
Yeah, and I was there, too.

44:21.407 --> 44:23.274
I'm kinda surprised to hear
this now.

44:23.309 --> 44:25.176
Just 'cause I can't investigate
this in a police capacity

44:25.211 --> 44:26.678
doesn't mean I'm sitting
this one out.

44:26.713 --> 44:28.646
I'm back in Real Murders
and I wanna help

44:28.682 --> 44:31.716
and I also wanna make sure you
all don't get in Lynn's way.

44:31.751 --> 44:33.818
That's a fine line you'll be
walking, detective.

44:33.853 --> 44:35.687
I'd say you're balancing
on a thin line yourself,

44:35.755 --> 44:36.821
Madam Mayor.

44:36.890 --> 44:38.089
Ok guys, we know that

44:38.124 --> 44:39.891
someone drugged Celia's coffee
that morning

44:39.926 --> 44:42.493
so the first question is
who gave her the coffee?

44:42.528 --> 44:43.895
Oh, that would be Joel Parker.

44:43.930 --> 44:45.296
He brought her a cup of coffee
when he and the producer

44:45.364 --> 44:48.232
went into Celia's trailer to do
some kind of rehearsal.

44:48.301 --> 44:49.600
So where'd he get
the coffee?

44:49.635 --> 44:52.203
He said his assistant fetched it
for him, Will Weir.

44:52.238 --> 44:54.672
Who also found her body.

44:54.708 --> 44:56.273
I think I know where the drug
came from.

44:56.309 --> 44:58.609
Ellen, the producer, says
her sleeping pills were missing

44:58.644 --> 44:59.610
from her purse.

44:59.645 --> 45:01.679
And yes, Lynn knows.
I told her.

45:01.715 --> 45:03.547
Does she know who took
the pills from her purse?

45:03.616 --> 45:05.416
She said repeatedly
it could be anyone,

45:05.451 --> 45:08.753
to the point I started wondering
if she was protesting too much.

45:08.822 --> 45:10.654
Right, but with three people
in the trailer it'd be hard

45:10.690 --> 45:13.490
for her to slip something in the
coffee without being noticed.

45:13.559 --> 45:14.926
Well, still not impossible.

45:14.961 --> 45:16.861
But then there's the problem
of who had the opportunity

45:16.896 --> 45:19.797
to go back to the trailer
to hit Celia?

45:19.833 --> 45:22.033
Ellen Post can account
for every moment

45:22.068 --> 45:23.500
after she left that trailer,

45:23.536 --> 45:25.603
and so can the other two
who left fingerprints behind.

45:25.638 --> 45:27.004
Joel Parker and Will Weir.

45:27.073 --> 45:29.373
No, Will was in there
a good 60 seconds alone

45:29.408 --> 45:32.009
when he found her body
so he could have hit her.

45:32.045 --> 45:33.945
You said you saw Meredith
knocking on the trailer

45:33.980 --> 45:35.113
before the body was found.

45:35.148 --> 45:36.714
And Meredith had a motive.

45:36.750 --> 45:38.082
She wanted Celia's part bad.

45:38.151 --> 45:39.383
She was bragging
that she had memorized

45:39.452 --> 45:41.986
all her character's lines
before Celia was killed.

45:43.957 --> 45:46.624
And, Ro, Robin can't be
ruled out.

45:46.659 --> 45:49.560
He's an ex of Celia's and she
did call the cops on him

45:49.595 --> 45:50.862
saying she feared he might
hurt her.

45:50.897 --> 45:52.897
I know he swears it was
a misunderstanding, but...

45:52.932 --> 45:55.599
Robin has an alibi and
if anyone's gonna find out

45:55.635 --> 45:58.202
something more about Robin
it's gonna be Martin

45:58.238 --> 46:00.138
so I think that we should
just concentrate

46:00.173 --> 46:03.841
on these four people and see
what we can find out about them.

46:03.910 --> 46:06.610
Alright, well I'm still working
as a consultant on the movie,

46:06.679 --> 46:08.246
I can try and get
a handle on Will.

46:08.314 --> 46:10.815
And Meredith offered to let
me interview her for a story.

46:10.850 --> 46:13.084
I'm sure I can come up with
a reason to talk to Ellen again.

46:13.119 --> 46:14.585
Yeah, and I'll start
with my mother,

46:14.654 --> 46:16.988
see if I can get any inside
information about Joel Parker.

46:17.023 --> 46:19.523
She's on a location scout
with him.

46:25.298 --> 46:27.865
Aurora, I really appreciate
your filling the dishwasher

46:27.901 --> 46:29.466
but next time do you think
you could rinse

46:29.502 --> 46:30.701
the glasses a little bit better?

46:30.770 --> 46:33.004
You know, before
you stack them?

46:33.072 --> 46:34.939
If I didn't know any better I'd
think you were doing the dishes

46:35.008 --> 46:38.375
with a book propped up, just
like when you were a teenager.

46:41.047 --> 46:42.413
And you're not
acknowledging me,

46:42.448 --> 46:44.315
just like when you were
a teenager.

46:44.350 --> 46:45.516
Yes, mother.

46:45.551 --> 46:49.520
I vow to be a better dish-rinser
in the future.

46:49.555 --> 46:52.356
But I cannot stop thinking about
what you told me about Joel

46:52.391 --> 46:55.759
already re-casting Celia's
part in only two days.

46:55.795 --> 46:58.429
Yes, he said he's getting a lot
of pressure from his investors.

46:58.497 --> 46:59.864
They want him
to resume shooting

46:59.899 --> 47:01.665
so they're gonna be up in
production in a day or two.

47:01.734 --> 47:03.301
Do you know who they got
to play the part?

47:03.369 --> 47:04.501
Is it Meredith Wear?

47:04.537 --> 47:08.840
No, it's um... Diana somebody.

47:08.908 --> 47:12.276
But Joel also told me that
she was his first choice.

47:12.345 --> 47:13.711
He thought Celia was unreliable

47:13.746 --> 47:16.814
and that maybe
she'd ruin his movie.

47:16.883 --> 47:19.050
Mother, do you know
what this means?

47:19.085 --> 47:21.853
Joel Parker had a motive
for murdering Celia.

47:21.888 --> 47:23.321
Oh, please.

47:23.356 --> 47:24.788
Yes.

47:24.824 --> 47:26.390
Joel's the one that brought
her the coffee that morning.

47:26.425 --> 47:28.726
And the police are saying
that that's how the overdose

47:28.794 --> 47:29.626
of drugs got in her system.

47:29.662 --> 47:32.563
Through the coffee.

47:32.598 --> 47:36.000
No. Joel Parker's a lovely man.

47:36.035 --> 47:38.336
I'm sure he'd do absolutely
no harm to his lead actress.

47:38.404 --> 47:42.340
Oh, the lead actress he thought
could ruin his film?

47:42.375 --> 47:44.775
Mother, you have to call
Lynn Smith and tell her

47:44.810 --> 47:46.377
that Joel wanted
another actress.

47:46.412 --> 47:48.179
[phone rings]

47:48.214 --> 47:50.381
Right after I get this.

47:50.449 --> 47:51.949
Hi, Perry.

47:51.985 --> 47:53.784
<i>Ok, so two minutes into</i>
<i>my interview with Meredith</i>

47:53.819 --> 47:54.919
the police show up.

47:54.954 --> 47:56.087
They're bringing her
to the station now.

47:56.155 --> 47:57.821
What? Why?

47:57.857 --> 47:59.357
<i>Apparently her fingerprints</i>
<i>were all over the lamp</i>

47:59.425 --> 48:00.892
<i>used to hit Celia Shaw.</i>

48:00.927 --> 48:02.760
Hold on, she's waving at me.
I gotta go.

48:02.828 --> 48:04.295
We'll have to do this interview
some other time, ok?

48:04.330 --> 48:05.796
Oh yeah, no problem.

48:09.269 --> 48:12.036
Oh, hey! You forgot your purse!

48:16.075 --> 48:19.944
Perry, don't you do it.

48:19.979 --> 48:21.745
It's Meredith's bag and I
can see a bottle of pills.

48:21.781 --> 48:23.781
Whatever you see, it needs
to be legally obtained.

48:23.849 --> 48:26.317
It doesn't need
your prints all over it.

48:29.222 --> 48:30.587
I'll advise you again,
Meredith.

48:30.623 --> 48:32.756
You have the right to have
your lawyer look this over.

48:32.825 --> 48:35.960
I don't need a lawyer because
I'm telling you the truth.

48:35.995 --> 48:37.728
Celia didn't answer
when I knocked.

48:37.763 --> 48:40.497
I was never in her trailer
that day.

48:40.533 --> 48:41.865
You can ask Everett.

48:41.935 --> 48:44.969
He- he came up to me when
I was waiting at the door.

48:45.038 --> 48:48.339
And I- I really did give her
that lamp as a gift,

48:48.374 --> 48:50.808
that's the reason my
fingerprints are on it.

48:53.947 --> 48:56.047
Ok, I didn't like her.

48:56.115 --> 48:59.050
That doesn't mean that I didn't
want her to like me.

48:59.085 --> 49:00.451
We'll check your credit card
statements,

49:00.519 --> 49:01.752
see if we can verify
the purchase.

49:01.821 --> 49:03.887
Arthur, you know you're not
supposed to be here.

49:05.558 --> 49:07.291
That's my backpack.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.659
Well, maybe she can explain
to you

49:08.694 --> 49:12.196
why there's an empty bottle
of sleeping pills in it.

49:17.903 --> 49:20.938
I lied about being on the phone
with my agent

49:20.974 --> 49:22.606
at the time Celia was killed.

49:22.675 --> 49:25.109
It was dumb to lie
and I admitted as much to Lynn.

49:25.144 --> 49:26.910
Then why'd you do it?

49:26.946 --> 49:29.113
Because I didn't wanna say
what I was really doing.

49:29.148 --> 49:31.015
Which was?

49:31.050 --> 49:32.783
Searching Will Weir's
hotel room.

49:32.818 --> 49:33.951
I know, I know.

49:33.987 --> 49:36.720
It's not honourable
but he'd been spending

49:36.755 --> 49:38.189
so much time with Celia.

49:38.224 --> 49:39.490
Then you were jealous.

49:39.525 --> 49:40.791
No, it had nothing
to do with jealousy.

49:40.826 --> 49:43.394
I just- I don't trust him.

49:43.429 --> 49:44.362
There's a guy on the crew,

49:44.397 --> 49:45.529
said he had a girlfriend
in LA

49:45.564 --> 49:47.798
and I wanted to see
if I could find proof.

49:47.833 --> 49:51.535
Also, I know that he agreed with
Joel about hiring Diana Weldon

49:51.570 --> 49:52.769
instead of Celia,

49:52.805 --> 49:56.107
but I had cast approval
put in my contract.

49:56.142 --> 49:57.208
It's my story.

49:57.243 --> 49:59.210
I wanted a say in
who would play you.

49:59.245 --> 50:01.178
I mean, who would
play Adelaide.

50:01.214 --> 50:04.748
Well, that would explain
Will's resentment towards you.

50:04.783 --> 50:06.117
Yeah.

50:06.185 --> 50:09.320
Also, he had no time for Celia
during pre-production

50:09.355 --> 50:12.356
and suddenly, out of nowhere,
he's hitting on her.

50:12.392 --> 50:15.126
Well, maybe- maybe he broke up
with his girlfriend

50:15.161 --> 50:16.927
and maybe Celia won him over.

50:16.962 --> 50:18.762
She was very sweet.

50:18.797 --> 50:20.831
Yeah, she was.

50:20.866 --> 50:24.868
But I have to ask, why did she
say that she was afraid of you?

50:24.904 --> 50:27.438
She had a medical condition,
Huntington's Disease.

50:27.473 --> 50:29.373
Oh no.

50:29.409 --> 50:31.342
Oh, I've read about that.

50:31.377 --> 50:35.513
So that would explain her
stumbling and the odd behaviour.

50:35.548 --> 50:37.548
She used to imagine things
that weren't happening

50:37.616 --> 50:39.483
and then she'd apologize
about it afterwards.

50:39.519 --> 50:42.286
That's why she called the police
that one time.

50:42.355 --> 50:44.255
She knew she was getting worse
and this might be

50:44.323 --> 50:46.790
her last movie and she wanted
to do a good job

50:46.825 --> 50:48.225
and I wanted to help her.

50:48.261 --> 50:50.361
I felt protective of her.

50:50.396 --> 50:52.363
So you searched
Will's hotel room?

50:52.398 --> 50:54.998
Yeah. But I didn't find
any evidence of a girlfriend.

50:55.068 --> 50:57.000
No pictures, no notes,
nothing.

50:57.036 --> 50:59.303
Do you think he could have
killed her?

50:59.338 --> 51:01.805
I did, but now they're
holding Meredith

51:01.840 --> 51:03.774
and they found an empty bottle
of sleeping pills

51:03.809 --> 51:05.109
in her backpack.

51:05.178 --> 51:06.643
I know, but Arthur said
they didn't find any prints

51:06.679 --> 51:08.045
on that bottle
and she swears

51:08.114 --> 51:10.448
she has no idea how it got
in her bag.

51:10.483 --> 51:12.316
And really, I don't know
how she could have put

51:12.351 --> 51:13.417
the drug in the coffee.

51:13.486 --> 51:15.519
It was Joel Parker
who gave it to her.

51:15.588 --> 51:19.756
But who fetches coffee
for the director?

51:19.825 --> 51:22.693
Well, the assistant, Will Weir.

51:22.761 --> 51:26.397
Right. Now we're just...
going in circles.

51:40.446 --> 51:42.813
Hi, have you seen
Taylor today?

51:42.848 --> 51:44.281
I heard she wasn't feeling
so hot.

51:44.317 --> 51:45.182
I don't know.

51:45.251 --> 51:46.817
That guy's covering, though.

51:46.885 --> 51:47.551
Oh.

51:47.587 --> 51:49.220
Ok, thanks.

51:56.329 --> 51:58.996
<i>(Joel): I guess there's a first</i>
<i>time for everything, right?</i>

51:59.031 --> 52:00.131
[laughs]

52:00.166 --> 52:02.199
Oh, fresh air.

52:02.235 --> 52:03.967
<i>That's what you are to me.</i>

52:04.003 --> 52:05.302
You are all syrup.

52:05.338 --> 52:06.370
[laughs]

52:06.439 --> 52:08.905
Lucky for you, I've got
a sweet tooth.

52:22.955 --> 52:25.356
Why were you spying
on your boss?

52:25.391 --> 52:27.224
I wasn't spying.

52:27.293 --> 52:28.659
Well, it sure looked like it.

52:28.694 --> 52:31.094
No, I just didn't want Joel
to see me.

52:31.130 --> 52:32.563
Why? You're his assistant.

52:32.598 --> 52:34.998
Right. His assistant,
not his fall guy.

52:35.034 --> 52:36.600
You know the police were here
this morning saying

52:36.636 --> 52:38.902
that Joel told them I got
the coffee he gave to Celia

52:38.937 --> 52:40.204
when I didn't?

52:40.239 --> 52:42.173
You know, for the first time
in recorded history

52:42.208 --> 52:43.574
Joel Parker got
himself a coffee.

52:43.609 --> 52:45.842
Then why did he say
that you got it?

52:45.878 --> 52:48.612
That's what I'd like to know.

52:48.648 --> 52:49.813
I think I'm the only person
on this set

52:49.848 --> 52:53.717
who actually cared about Celia.

52:53.752 --> 52:55.686
That's not right.

53:20.315 --> 53:23.516
"Stay away from Robin Daniels
or you'll regret it."

53:38.100 --> 53:41.668
I think we all agree that Aurora
should listen to that note

53:41.703 --> 53:43.503
and stay away
from Robin Daniels.

53:43.572 --> 53:45.105
Celia was afraid of him.

53:45.141 --> 53:46.840
Yeah, because Celia
has a condition

53:46.876 --> 53:48.675
that makes her imagine things.

53:48.710 --> 53:49.810
You believe that?

53:49.845 --> 53:51.111
The coroner did find
Huntington's Disease

53:51.147 --> 53:53.781
which does affect balance
and perceptions,

53:53.816 --> 53:54.848
things like that.

53:54.884 --> 53:56.817
Well, Robin did lie
about his alibi.

53:56.852 --> 53:58.485
Only because Robin
was embarrassed

53:58.553 --> 54:00.921
that he was searching
Will Weir's hotel room.

54:00.990 --> 54:03.791
Which we have now corroborated
with hotel security footage.

54:03.826 --> 54:05.659
Ah. So Robin has an alibi.

54:05.727 --> 54:08.328
See? He couldn't have drugged
Celia's coffee.

54:08.363 --> 54:09.963
Well, we are still trying to get
to the bottom

54:09.999 --> 54:10.764
of the whole coffee thing.

54:10.800 --> 54:11.999
Wait, wait, wait.

54:12.034 --> 54:16.303
So either Joel Parker lied
or Will is lying.

54:16.338 --> 54:19.239
I hope you haven't
ruled out Robin.

54:19.275 --> 54:21.541
You can't stop focussing
on Robin.

54:21.576 --> 54:23.877
Neither can whoever wrote
that note.

54:23.913 --> 54:26.847
They obviously know something
about him you don't.

54:32.387 --> 54:33.753
Mother!

54:33.789 --> 54:35.722
Aurora, did- did we have plans
to see a house today?

54:35.757 --> 54:37.191
No.

54:37.226 --> 54:38.725
I'm here because I know you
had lunch with Joel Parker.

54:38.794 --> 54:40.160
Oh, yes.

54:40.196 --> 54:41.929
We had a lovely time.

54:41.964 --> 54:44.397
He is a suspect
in a murder case.

54:44.433 --> 54:45.833
I happen to know
that the police

54:45.868 --> 54:47.267
are holding that young actress.

54:47.303 --> 54:49.069
They haven't charged her yet
so it could still turn out

54:49.104 --> 54:50.270
to be Joel.

54:50.306 --> 54:52.105
And after all the lectures
you've given me.

54:52.174 --> 54:53.707
Before you return the favour,

54:53.742 --> 54:54.875
I've spent a lot of time
with him now.

54:54.944 --> 54:57.110
He is not a cold-blooded killer.

54:57.146 --> 54:58.846
I can't expect you to take
my word on this

54:58.881 --> 55:00.881
but I wish you would.

55:00.950 --> 55:03.283
I have been saying
the same thing to Martin.

55:03.319 --> 55:05.385
I need him to trust my instincts
about Robin.

55:05.420 --> 55:06.820
See?

55:08.891 --> 55:11.391
Just promise me you'll be
careful, ok?

55:11.426 --> 55:14.194
And maybe try not to spend time
alone with him?

55:14.230 --> 55:15.695
I've got this.

55:20.369 --> 55:21.568
I don't get it.

55:21.636 --> 55:23.904
Why would someone wanna warn you
away from me?

55:23.939 --> 55:27.741
I think it must have something
to do with Celia's murder.

55:27.809 --> 55:30.143
You dated her,
you dated me...

55:31.914 --> 55:33.713
It never occurred to me
that what happened to Celia

55:33.749 --> 55:35.682
had anything to do with me.

55:37.519 --> 55:39.052
But if that's true then-

55:39.088 --> 55:40.520
then I shouldn't even be
talking to you.

55:40.555 --> 55:41.188
I'm putting you
in danger.

55:41.223 --> 55:42.055
I should go.

55:42.091 --> 55:42.990
Robin, wait.

55:43.025 --> 55:43.991
No. No.

55:44.026 --> 55:46.326
Just listen to that note.

55:46.395 --> 55:48.262
I gotta figure this out.

55:53.235 --> 55:55.835
Hey. I heard you had
to let Meredith go.

55:55.871 --> 55:57.905
We got proof that
she bought the lamp,

55:57.940 --> 55:59.806
and we have nothing
to refute her story

55:59.841 --> 56:01.441
that she doesn't know how
those pills

56:01.476 --> 56:02.609
got into her backpack.

56:02.677 --> 56:05.112
And I shouldn't be telling you
any of this.

56:05.147 --> 56:07.147
Well, you called me in
so you must need me back

56:07.182 --> 56:09.082
on the case after all.

56:09.118 --> 56:11.584
I called you in because
you didn't finish typing up

56:11.653 --> 56:14.021
all of those statements you took
on the day of the murder.

56:14.089 --> 56:15.989
Right, because you suspended me.

56:16.025 --> 56:17.690
But I left you all
my handwritten notes.

56:17.726 --> 56:20.160
Arthur, you know how I always
have you read to me

56:20.195 --> 56:22.129
all those cute little
construction paper

56:22.164 --> 56:23.397
birthday cards you make me?

56:23.432 --> 56:24.864
Yeah, it's kind of our thing.

56:24.900 --> 56:26.800
It's because I can't read them.
Your handwriting's awful.

56:26.835 --> 56:27.667
Ouch.

56:27.702 --> 56:30.804
Ok, so what do you need
to know?

56:30.872 --> 56:33.573
I spoke with Ellen Post about
how Joel Parker was the one

56:33.642 --> 56:35.042
who delivered
the coffee to Celia.

56:35.110 --> 56:36.910
I need to make sure that her
story hasn't changed

56:36.946 --> 56:39.379
from the one she gave you
on the day of the murder.

56:39.415 --> 56:41.848
Shoot, I- I didn't ask
her about that.

56:41.883 --> 56:43.850
Sorry, I didn't know how
important the coffee

56:43.919 --> 56:44.784
would turn out to be.

56:44.820 --> 56:46.420
Why? What did she say?

56:46.455 --> 56:49.289
She said the craft services girl
gave it to Parker,

56:49.325 --> 56:51.458
but her and Parker assumed
that Will Weir was the one

56:51.493 --> 56:52.859
who requested it.

56:52.894 --> 56:55.128
But of course Weir said
that wasn't the case.

56:55.164 --> 56:56.496
So hang on.

56:56.531 --> 56:58.298
Taylor Harden handed Parker
coffee meant for Celia

56:58.334 --> 56:59.632
all on her own, unprompted?

56:59.701 --> 57:01.001
Why would she do that?

57:01.036 --> 57:02.235
She wouldn't, so
you're wondering

57:02.304 --> 57:05.138
if Ellen Post is changing
her story because...

57:05.174 --> 57:07.040
I wanna rule out the director
and the producer

57:07.076 --> 57:10.243
committing the murder together.

57:10.312 --> 57:12.612
Kinda feels like I'm back
on the case.

57:13.548 --> 57:14.881
Just sayin'.

57:58.693 --> 58:00.327
Lillian!

58:00.362 --> 58:03.930
You don't have to shout,
you scared me to death!

58:03.965 --> 58:05.399
Who is that man?

58:05.434 --> 58:09.336
I don't know, but whoever it
was, they were following me.

58:14.510 --> 58:16.809
So if Robin was here
at the library today

58:16.845 --> 58:19.379
and in light of the note that
you found on your windshield

58:19.415 --> 58:21.048
at the production office,

58:21.083 --> 58:23.550
I would say you're right.
That person was following you.

58:23.618 --> 58:24.784
But you didn't see a face?

58:24.819 --> 58:26.153
No, no.

58:26.221 --> 58:28.755
They just had on a big, uh, dark
sweatshirt with a hood.

58:28.823 --> 58:30.857
Uh, what about build? Height?

58:30.892 --> 58:32.159
Not tall.

58:32.194 --> 58:34.094
A short, stocky guy.

58:34.129 --> 58:37.664
Actually, I got the impression
that it was a woman.

58:37.699 --> 58:39.299
What would make you
say that?

58:39.334 --> 58:42.502
Well, when I walked by
it smelled cinnamon-y,

58:42.538 --> 58:44.371
like baked goods.

58:44.406 --> 58:47.574
Like, uh, the cinnamon rolls
that they have on the movie set

58:47.609 --> 58:48.442
at Craft Service.

58:48.477 --> 58:49.842
That's not very nutritional.

58:49.878 --> 58:51.311
You'd think a movie production
would hire someone-

58:51.346 --> 58:52.379
Taylor.

58:54.916 --> 58:57.016
Wait, what are you thinking?

58:57.052 --> 58:59.152
Well, Taylor works
at Craft Services

58:59.188 --> 59:01.621
and she always has
cinnamon rolls for the crew.

59:01.656 --> 59:03.056
Well, I assume
she's at work today.

59:03.092 --> 59:05.658
No. She called in sick.

59:05.694 --> 59:07.927
And the day that Celia Shaw
was murdered-

59:07.963 --> 59:09.329
Her trailer was parked outside
of Craft Services.

59:09.398 --> 59:11.764
And she said she's a huge
Robin Daniels fan.

59:11.800 --> 59:13.066
I'm gonna get a background check
going on her.

59:13.102 --> 59:15.469
Track her down right away
so we can talk to her.

59:15.504 --> 59:17.870
Ro, please be careful.

59:18.773 --> 59:21.508
You really think that woman was
who we saw in the parking lot?

59:21.543 --> 59:24.744
I have no idea, but Lillian,
I am so glad

59:24.779 --> 59:26.546
that you came out to the car
when you did.

59:26.582 --> 59:27.581
Ok, well, uh, if you don't need
anything else

59:27.649 --> 59:29.216
I'm gonna go home again.

59:29.284 --> 59:30.683
Aurora.

59:30.752 --> 59:33.019
I know you're probably mad at me
for not calling you sooner

59:33.054 --> 59:36.523
to tell you what
was happening but I-

59:36.558 --> 59:38.091
I'm not mad.

59:38.127 --> 59:40.193
I'm just grateful you're ok.

59:40.229 --> 59:44.131
Oh, thank you for caring
about me so much.

59:45.800 --> 59:46.733
Let me get you home.

59:46.768 --> 59:47.934
No, no.

59:47.969 --> 59:49.569
I'm- I'm gonna drive myself.

59:49.638 --> 59:52.472
And before you say I can't,
Lynn is going to send a unit

59:52.508 --> 59:55.375
behind me to follow me home
to make sure I get there safely.

59:55.410 --> 59:58.311
But if there is something
that you wanna do

59:58.347 --> 01:00:00.713
that would make me
really happy...

01:00:02.117 --> 01:00:05.118
I'll pick you some up and bring
it by your mom's later.

01:00:05.154 --> 01:00:07.454
What would I do without you?

01:00:07.489 --> 01:00:09.756
Help me lock up the library.

01:00:14.084 --> 01:00:17.430
And a side of extra
cream cheese icing.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.407
Hey, it's Vartel.

01:00:19.442 --> 01:00:21.843
Has he gotten back to you?

01:00:21.879 --> 01:00:23.678
Well, then he's dodging us.

01:00:23.747 --> 01:00:25.780
No, no. That doesn't make sense.

01:00:25.816 --> 01:00:27.248
None of this is making
any sense.

01:00:27.283 --> 01:00:29.450
A big slice of carrot cake
with extra cream cheese icing.

01:00:29.486 --> 01:00:30.852
To go, please.

01:00:35.859 --> 01:00:37.626
Let me call you back.

01:00:41.197 --> 01:00:45.967
I see you're familiar with
Ro's favourite comfort food.

01:00:46.003 --> 01:00:49.738
I heard someone gave her
a scare, so...

01:00:49.773 --> 01:00:54.308
Likely because of her connection
to you.

01:00:54.377 --> 01:00:56.244
I hope that's not true.

01:00:56.279 --> 01:01:01.816
But if it is, I- I can't tell
you how terrible I feel.

01:01:01.885 --> 01:01:04.653
Let me buy you a cup
of coffee.

01:01:07.758 --> 01:01:09.323
Sure.

01:01:11.494 --> 01:01:13.461
<i>[door opens]</i>

01:01:15.265 --> 01:01:18.767
Oh my gosh,
are you ok?

01:01:18.835 --> 01:01:20.201
Oh, my goodness,

01:01:20.236 --> 01:01:21.770
do you want something to eat
or some tea or something?

01:01:21.805 --> 01:01:24.238
No, no. You don't
have to do that, I'm fine.

01:01:24.274 --> 01:01:29.444
Aurora, you're being stalked.
Fine is not the right word.

01:01:29.479 --> 01:01:31.079
Come on, honey,
I am your mother.

01:01:31.114 --> 01:01:33.114
You can tell me the truth.

01:01:33.183 --> 01:01:35.050
The truth is it happened
so fast

01:01:35.118 --> 01:01:37.418
that it doesn't even seem real
to me.

01:01:37.454 --> 01:01:38.787
But if it catches up

01:01:38.822 --> 01:01:43.458
I promise I will come cry
on your shoulder.

01:01:43.493 --> 01:01:46.628
You're always gonna be
my baby.

01:01:46.697 --> 01:01:50.031
I'm not sure I'm fine so
I'm gonna go take a hot bath.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.499
But let me know if you need
anything, ok honey?

01:01:51.568 --> 01:01:52.801
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:01:52.869 --> 01:01:54.268
Alright.

01:01:58.274 --> 01:02:01.375
[phone ringing]

01:02:02.045 --> 01:02:02.844
Hello?

01:02:02.879 --> 01:02:03.979
<i>Ro, it's Lynn.</i>

01:02:04.014 --> 01:02:06.615
Listen, we ran priors
on Taylor Harden.

01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:08.917
Turns out that she was arrested
two years ago

01:02:08.952 --> 01:02:12.687
for stalking an actor and
assaulting his wife with a vase.

01:02:12.756 --> 01:02:15.023
<i>Charges were dropped,</i>
<i>I'm not sure why.</i>

01:02:15.058 --> 01:02:16.658
So she's the one.

01:02:16.693 --> 01:02:19.961
The rabid Robin Daniels fan.

01:02:19.997 --> 01:02:21.395
Well, if she came
after me today-

01:02:21.431 --> 01:02:22.797
She targeted Celia Shaw

01:02:22.866 --> 01:02:24.866
probably because of her romance
with Robin.

01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:26.835
Wow, she seemed
so friendly on set.

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:28.402
<i>Well, she's not</i>
<i>at her hotel.</i>

01:02:28.438 --> 01:02:31.106
I've got an APB out on her but
I wanna make sure you're safe.

01:02:31.174 --> 01:02:33.041
We're gonna send that unit back
to your mother's house

01:02:33.076 --> 01:02:35.110
to keep an eye on it just until
we can get our hands on her.

01:02:35.145 --> 01:02:37.378
Ok. I'll set the alarm system,
too.

01:02:37.413 --> 01:02:40.181
Good. I'll let you know
as soon as we find her.

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:55.130
[gasps]

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:04.973
Taylor... I am not
your enemy.

01:03:05.008 --> 01:03:07.375
I- I wanna help you
if you'll let me.

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:08.710
No.

01:03:08.745 --> 01:03:11.412
You just wanna help yourself
to Robin again.

01:03:11.447 --> 01:03:14.082
You won't stay away from him
even though I warned you.

01:03:14.117 --> 01:03:17.786
No. I- I don't want Robin,
I have a boyfriend.

01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:19.921
His name is Martin.

01:03:19.956 --> 01:03:22.423
You don't know how hard it was
for me to get this job

01:03:22.492 --> 01:03:25.760
so I could meet Robin so
we could finally be together!

01:03:25.796 --> 01:03:26.928
[smash]

01:03:31.802 --> 01:03:33.101
[smash]

01:03:33.904 --> 01:03:35.369
I know what you did.

01:03:35.405 --> 01:03:36.771
And the police are
on to you.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.473
In that time that no one can
account for you slipped

01:03:39.509 --> 01:03:42.376
into Celia's dressing room
and you hit her.

01:03:42.412 --> 01:03:44.979
Yes, I hit her.

01:03:45.015 --> 01:03:48.282
He's supposed to be
with me.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.586
[groans]

01:03:53.123 --> 01:03:56.557
Don't you ever touch
my daughter!

01:04:04.467 --> 01:04:08.502
Ok, I know that you don't have
a lot of respect for me.

01:04:08.538 --> 01:04:10.939
I practice a great deal of
caution when it comes

01:04:10.974 --> 01:04:12.506
to the woman I love,

01:04:12.542 --> 01:04:15.143
and if there's any chance that
you were Celia Shaw's killer-

01:04:15.178 --> 01:04:18.213
Hey, I would never hurt Celia.

01:04:18.248 --> 01:04:19.781
I cared about her.

01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:22.350
Just like I care about Ro.

01:04:22.385 --> 01:04:24.352
That's the other problem.

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.255
You based the main character
in your novel on Aurora,

01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:29.891
you turned it into a love story
between the two of you-

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.993
You do realize that the book

01:04:32.062 --> 01:04:36.998
and script are works
of fiction, right?

01:04:37.033 --> 01:04:41.469
Look, Aurora Teagarden
is a remarkable woman,

01:04:41.504 --> 01:04:45.539
but she's made it clear that
she's completely devoted to you.

01:04:45.608 --> 01:04:47.441
I'm no threat to that.

01:04:49.079 --> 01:04:50.678
[message alert]

01:04:52.682 --> 01:04:53.748
Something wrong?

01:04:53.784 --> 01:04:55.884
I'm bracing myself
for some bad news.

01:04:55.919 --> 01:04:57.718
A close friend has disappeared
in South America

01:04:57.754 --> 01:05:00.688
and the story keeps getting
worse and worse.

01:05:00.757 --> 01:05:02.791
His family's missing,
wife, kids...

01:05:02.859 --> 01:05:03.825
Oh.

01:05:05.328 --> 01:05:06.560
It's Aida.

01:05:06.596 --> 01:05:08.396
Taylor Harden broke
into the house

01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:09.931
and tried to attack Ro.

01:05:09.966 --> 01:05:11.332
What?

01:05:18.275 --> 01:05:19.707
So let me see if I have
this right.

01:05:19.742 --> 01:05:23.311
Ellen the producer saw Taylor
give Joel that coffee?

01:05:23.346 --> 01:05:26.514
That's how Celia was drugged,
through coffee poured by Taylor.

01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:28.683
Taylor admitted
to hitting Celia.

01:05:28.718 --> 01:05:30.118
It sounds pretty clear cut.

01:05:30.153 --> 01:05:31.752
I'm gonna have
to question Taylor

01:05:31.788 --> 01:05:33.554
but I think we have
our murderer.

01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:35.990
I hope so. For everyone's sake.

01:05:36.026 --> 01:05:37.658
But why do you suppose Taylor

01:05:37.727 --> 01:05:39.994
would risk going into
the trailer to hit Celia

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:41.729
if she'd already drugged her?

01:05:41.798 --> 01:05:43.798
Well, maybe she didn't know
exactly how much coffee

01:05:43.834 --> 01:05:45.133
Celia would drink.

01:05:45.168 --> 01:05:46.600
<i>Aurora!</i>

01:05:48.104 --> 01:05:49.337
Please don't hate me.

01:05:49.372 --> 01:05:50.771
I had to do it.

01:05:50.807 --> 01:05:52.307
Celia wasn't good enough
for you.

01:05:52.342 --> 01:05:55.476
She could never make you happy
the way that I could.

01:06:15.098 --> 01:06:17.832
Last night she's a weeping mess,
this morning she's smug?

01:06:17.868 --> 01:06:19.334
Yeah.

01:06:19.369 --> 01:06:21.970
It seems that she got a hold of
the newspaper this morning.

01:06:22.038 --> 01:06:23.238
That's right.

01:06:23.273 --> 01:06:24.973
And now I know you can't
charge me with murder.

01:06:25.008 --> 01:06:27.342
As we told you before,
you've already been charged.

01:06:27.377 --> 01:06:29.377
But the newspaper said
Celia was already dead

01:06:29.412 --> 01:06:30.711
before I hit her.

01:06:30.747 --> 01:06:32.813
So how can that be murder?

01:06:32.849 --> 01:06:34.148
Well, I think the massive dose
of drugs

01:06:34.184 --> 01:06:36.617
you put in her coffee
will suffice.

01:06:36.652 --> 01:06:38.586
I didn't put any drugs
in her coffee.

01:06:38.621 --> 01:06:41.489
We have witness testimony
saying you poured the coffee

01:06:41.524 --> 01:06:42.924
then gave it to Joel Parker
who then gave it to Celia.

01:06:42.959 --> 01:06:46.094
Yeah, I poured it,
that's my job.

01:06:46.162 --> 01:06:48.829
Celia came by earlier and
asked for some and I told her

01:06:48.865 --> 01:06:51.766
she'd have to wait
because it was still brewing.

01:06:51.801 --> 01:06:54.068
Look, I admit, I wanted
her dead,

01:06:54.137 --> 01:06:56.905
but I did not put anything
in her coffee.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.739
Someone else did that.

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:09.310
<i>...one of those.</i>

01:07:09.345 --> 01:07:10.511
<i>Indeed.</i>

01:07:10.546 --> 01:07:11.845
Oh, good morning.

01:07:11.914 --> 01:07:13.246
Honey, you know Joel,
of course,

01:07:13.282 --> 01:07:15.416
and this is his new lead
actress, Diana Weldon.

01:07:15.451 --> 01:07:17.818
Aurora, what a pleasure
to meet you.

01:07:17.853 --> 01:07:19.286
You, too.

01:07:19.322 --> 01:07:21.722
It's nice of you to be here
for the movie.

01:07:21.757 --> 01:07:23.190
And you know,
the pro that she is,

01:07:23.225 --> 01:07:26.259
she's gonna start shooting
some scenes later on today.

01:07:26.295 --> 01:07:29.430
Oh, well if you came for some
insight about the character

01:07:29.498 --> 01:07:30.964
that's based on me-

01:07:30.999 --> 01:07:32.333
Oh, no.

01:07:32.368 --> 01:07:35.302
I- I like to put my own
interpretation on a character.

01:07:35.371 --> 01:07:36.503
They're here to pick me up.

01:07:36.539 --> 01:07:38.238
Diana needs a place to stay
while she's here

01:07:38.307 --> 01:07:39.773
and I'm gonna show her
some condos.

01:07:39.809 --> 01:07:41.775
Actually, the one that you
used to live in.

01:07:41.811 --> 01:07:44.345
Maybe Aurora left behind
some librarian energy.

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.045
Mmm.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.547
Soak it up.

01:07:46.615 --> 01:07:49.316
I've already been bathing in
book dust, Joel, don't worry.

01:07:50.386 --> 01:07:52.919
Are you alright, honey?
How'd you sleep?

01:07:52.988 --> 01:07:54.788
Great, thanks to you.

01:07:54.824 --> 01:07:55.489
Yeah.

01:07:55.524 --> 01:07:56.390
Go enjoy your day.

01:07:56.425 --> 01:07:58.058
Ok.

01:08:11.073 --> 01:08:12.873
Excuse me, Aurora, um...

01:08:12.908 --> 01:08:15.409
Joel sent me to return the books
Celia checked out.

01:08:15.444 --> 01:08:17.411
I'll take them.

01:08:17.912 --> 01:08:19.680
Another Robin Daniels book.

01:08:19.715 --> 01:08:22.215
I doubt that one will be made
into a movie.

01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:24.350
Why do you say that?

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.354
Oh, he doesn't get
how Hollywood works.

01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:30.055
He used up all his capital
getting Celia cast in the part

01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:34.261
and we see how
that worked out.

01:08:34.296 --> 01:08:37.330
And that probably made me
sound like a jerk.

01:08:37.366 --> 01:08:39.666
I'm sorry.

01:08:39.734 --> 01:08:42.435
Um, well, thank you
for that.

01:08:42.505 --> 01:08:43.837
Hmm-mm.

01:08:43.872 --> 01:08:46.439
Hey, Will, um...

01:08:46.475 --> 01:08:48.876
Celia was never
Joel Parker's first choice,

01:08:48.911 --> 01:08:51.511
it was always Diana Weldon,
right?

01:08:51.546 --> 01:08:54.715
I hate to say it but she is
a better actress.

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:58.251
So then Joel was happy
that Diana got the part.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:08:59.653
Most everyone is.

01:08:59.688 --> 01:09:01.121
Even you?

01:09:01.156 --> 01:09:03.189
You and Celia were getting
pretty close before she died,

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:06.894
that must have been hard
to see her be replaced.

01:09:06.962 --> 01:09:11.096
It is. It's uh, it's very hard.

01:09:11.133 --> 01:09:14.635
I could have really fallen
for Celia.

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:17.404
But now my job is
to help Joel

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.772
make the best movie possible.

01:09:18.841 --> 01:09:21.942
And when I direct my movie
I'm gonna cast Diana, too.

01:09:21.977 --> 01:09:24.377
Or a star like Diana.

01:09:24.412 --> 01:09:26.680
Oh, you're making a movie?

01:09:26.715 --> 01:09:28.214
I will be, yeah.

01:09:28.283 --> 01:09:30.183
If this movie's a success
Joel's gonna help me

01:09:30.252 --> 01:09:32.553
find funding for mine.

01:09:32.587 --> 01:09:36.490
Oh, well, I hope everything
works out for you.

01:09:36.524 --> 01:09:38.792
Thank you. I think it will.

01:09:38.828 --> 01:09:39.792
Thanks for your help.

01:09:39.862 --> 01:09:41.227
Bye.

01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:43.029
Hi.

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.934
So, the movie production is
going to be here on Sunday.

01:09:46.969 --> 01:09:48.602
That was one of my conditions.

01:09:48.671 --> 01:09:50.537
I don't wanna inconvenience
our patrons.

01:09:50.606 --> 01:09:52.939
Ugh, what is this?

01:09:56.979 --> 01:09:59.646
This looks like Celia's
shooting schedule.

01:09:59.682 --> 01:10:02.616
The scenes she was supposed
to do her first day.

01:10:02.685 --> 01:10:06.152
<i>I hate it when people</i>
<i>leave garbage in our books.</i>

01:10:06.188 --> 01:10:08.789
I need to go look
at my script.

01:10:10.593 --> 01:10:13.193
I guess I'll put away
all your books for you.

01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:16.730
I want the condo.
Thank you so much.

01:10:16.765 --> 01:10:18.098
Oh, you are so welcome.

01:10:18.133 --> 01:10:20.467
Hair and make-up, let's go.
We got a movie to shoot.

01:10:20.503 --> 01:10:22.769
Barking orders already.

01:10:22.805 --> 01:10:25.038
Want my driver
to take you home?

01:10:25.073 --> 01:10:26.439
You know what,

01:10:26.475 --> 01:10:27.374
why don't you stay and watch
us make some movie magic?

01:10:27.442 --> 01:10:29.476
Ooh, I like magic.

01:10:29.545 --> 01:10:31.578
I like the fact that you
choose me.

01:10:31.614 --> 01:10:33.814
A suspect in a murder
investigation.

01:10:33.849 --> 01:10:37.551
I'm sure a lot of people warned
you to stay away from me.

01:10:37.586 --> 01:10:40.020
And yet, you chose me.

01:10:40.055 --> 01:10:43.456
I must be drawn
to dangerous men.

01:10:51.466 --> 01:10:53.700
"Adelaide pours sugar
from the packet into the mug

01:10:53.736 --> 01:10:56.302
"then picks up the mug
and sips her coffee."

01:10:58.741 --> 01:10:59.773
<i>Hello?</i>

01:10:59.808 --> 01:11:01.742
Perry, I think I know
who killed Celia

01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:03.143
and it wasn't Taylor Hardon.

01:11:03.178 --> 01:11:05.979
I'm gonna go to the set
right now and see if I'm right.

01:11:17.526 --> 01:11:18.992
Uh, you're in my chair.

01:11:19.028 --> 01:11:20.060
Pardon?

01:11:20.095 --> 01:11:21.895
You're in my chair.
I need it.

01:11:21.931 --> 01:11:24.130
Oh. Oh, I'm- I'm sorry.

01:11:24.166 --> 01:11:24.831
I didn't realize.

01:11:24.867 --> 01:11:26.332
Thanks.

01:11:27.002 --> 01:11:29.937
Oh, sugar.
I'll take care of that.

01:11:36.078 --> 01:11:37.277
Will, we're gonna need
a headset

01:11:37.345 --> 01:11:38.344
for when Aida gets here,
alright?

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.680
Sure.

01:12:04.539 --> 01:12:06.272
[dialing]

01:12:07.309 --> 01:12:11.211
[phone ringing]

01:12:11.246 --> 01:12:13.680
Come on, Perry.

01:12:17.586 --> 01:12:20.253
Oh, sorry Martin.

01:12:20.288 --> 01:12:21.688
But I know you're gonna try
and stop me

01:12:21.724 --> 01:12:23.924
and I have to find out
if I'm right about this.

01:12:23.959 --> 01:12:25.391
Hey, sorry it took a while.

01:12:25.427 --> 01:12:26.793
Costume lady
wouldn't let me go.

01:12:26.862 --> 01:12:28.829
What's this about the wrong
person being in jail

01:12:28.864 --> 01:12:29.796
for Celia's murder?

01:12:29.832 --> 01:12:31.364
Yeah, maybe.
Here, look at this.

01:12:31.433 --> 01:12:34.034
So it's the shooting schedule
for the day that Celia died.

01:12:34.069 --> 01:12:35.869
Now, we know that
she was running lines

01:12:35.904 --> 01:12:38.471
with Joel and Ellen for a scene
she was gonna shoot that day

01:12:38.507 --> 01:12:41.074
so I looked up the scene
and here, read this.

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:43.343
"Adelaide pours sugar from
the packet into the mug,

01:12:43.378 --> 01:12:45.211
then picks up the mug
and sips her coffee."

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.814
Right. So what if Celia
asked Taylor for the coffee

01:12:47.883 --> 01:12:49.883
so she was ready to rehearse
the scene?

01:12:49.918 --> 01:12:51.818
And Celia poured the sugar
in her coffee.

01:12:51.854 --> 01:12:53.020
Yes.

01:12:53.088 --> 01:12:55.689
I think someone drugged
the sugar in the packets

01:12:55.724 --> 01:12:59.492
in the trailer knowing she would
pour it into the coffee herself.

01:12:59.528 --> 01:13:00.827
I don't know.

01:13:00.863 --> 01:13:02.095
How would you get drugs
into a closed sugar packet?

01:13:02.131 --> 01:13:03.764
Have you ever looked
at a sugar packet?

01:13:03.799 --> 01:13:05.532
Most of them have perforations
on the side.

01:13:05.567 --> 01:13:07.801
It would be very easy to open
them, empty it out,

01:13:07.836 --> 01:13:10.436
refill it and glue it shut,
and you would never be able

01:13:10.472 --> 01:13:11.772
to tell unless looking closely.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.107
Ok, but how will we know
if Celia really put sugar

01:13:14.143 --> 01:13:16.409
in her coffee that morning?

01:13:16.444 --> 01:13:18.845
Ellen would know.
She's right there.

01:13:18.881 --> 01:13:21.281
This might be our best chance
to talk to her.

01:13:24.553 --> 01:13:26.086
If she's headed to set
we have to catch her.

01:13:26.121 --> 01:13:28.521
Ok, if somebody switched the
sugar packets in her trailer

01:13:28.557 --> 01:13:30.423
then why didn't the cops find
any empty packets

01:13:30.458 --> 01:13:32.025
with traces of the drug in them?

01:13:32.061 --> 01:13:33.526
I mean, it could have been
anyone at any time.

01:13:33.562 --> 01:13:34.961
How will we ever know
who it is?

01:13:34.997 --> 01:13:36.830
There's only one person
who's fingerprints were found

01:13:36.865 --> 01:13:39.900
all over the trailer and who
suddenly cozied up to Celia

01:13:39.935 --> 01:13:42.002
just days before her death,

01:13:42.037 --> 01:13:44.571
and who could have made those
drug sugar packets disappear

01:13:44.606 --> 01:13:46.272
when he found her body.

01:13:46.308 --> 01:13:48.675
Will Weir?
But why?

01:13:50.846 --> 01:13:52.512
Well, Will said something
that made me think

01:13:52.581 --> 01:13:55.648
he believes he can get this
new actress, Diana Weldon,

01:13:55.684 --> 01:13:57.617
to be the lead in his movie.

01:13:57.652 --> 01:13:59.019
For the one he wants to direct.

01:13:59.088 --> 01:14:00.253
Yes.

01:14:00.288 --> 01:14:02.122
And if Diana is the lead
in this movie

01:14:02.191 --> 01:14:05.491
then she becomes a bigger name
and then she can make sure

01:14:05.527 --> 01:14:07.961
that Will's movie gets made.

01:14:16.946 --> 01:14:18.545
If she really didn't drug Celia

01:14:18.581 --> 01:14:21.548
then we're right back
at square one.

01:14:21.584 --> 01:14:24.418
And at square one we ask
who would benefit most

01:14:24.453 --> 01:14:25.920
from the victim being gone.

01:14:25.955 --> 01:14:27.654
Yeah, but we've already asked
that of everybody connected

01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:29.857
to the production.

01:14:29.893 --> 01:14:33.094
Except the actress
who replaced her.

01:14:52.448 --> 01:14:53.948
Looks like your typical actress.

01:14:53.983 --> 01:14:55.950
No record, no skeletons
in her closet.

01:14:56.019 --> 01:14:57.751
Let me try an image search.

01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:03.257
Wait.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.993
"Diana Weldon and friend."

01:15:06.029 --> 01:15:08.296
Friend. They look
pretty cozy to me.

01:15:08.331 --> 01:15:09.730
I think we need to talk
to Will Weir.

01:15:09.765 --> 01:15:11.098
Yep.

01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:15.803
Didn't she go in here?

01:15:15.838 --> 01:15:18.406
I don't know, maybe someone
on the hill saw her.

01:15:18.874 --> 01:15:20.007
Ellen?

01:15:26.182 --> 01:15:27.815
Ellen?

01:15:32.288 --> 01:15:33.921
[door closes]

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:35.189
Hey!

01:15:35.992 --> 01:15:37.258
Hey!

01:15:37.793 --> 01:15:39.626
Hey, I'm in here!

01:16:20.136 --> 01:16:21.735
You can't hide, Aurora.

01:16:24.407 --> 01:16:28.476
[rumble]

01:16:29.245 --> 01:16:30.911
There's nowhere
for you to go!

01:16:30.946 --> 01:16:33.147
It's an old mine,
there's only two exits.

01:16:33.182 --> 01:16:34.948
They're both behind me!

01:16:34.984 --> 01:16:36.950
Oh, and uh, no cell reception,
either.

01:16:36.986 --> 01:16:39.153
Too much steel.

01:16:40.089 --> 01:16:42.156
Hey, did you see Ellen Post
come this way?

01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:43.157
No.

01:16:43.226 --> 01:16:44.325
Oh, hey, our scene's
up next, though.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.292
Yeah, sure.

01:16:45.361 --> 01:16:46.394
Hey, Ro...

01:17:05.314 --> 01:17:07.515
You're smart,
Aurora Teagarden.

01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:09.683
I'll give you that.

01:17:10.619 --> 01:17:13.554
I see why Robin Daniels
based a character on you now.

01:17:16.192 --> 01:17:19.493
But you should know
that I am much better

01:17:19.562 --> 01:17:22.496
at plotting murder than he is.

01:18:20.389 --> 01:18:21.888
You're running out of
real estate.

01:18:21.924 --> 01:18:23.690
The only thing down there
is a 100-foot drop

01:18:23.759 --> 01:18:25.559
to the ground.

01:18:30.433 --> 01:18:32.833
If you're gonna take the long
way I'll just meet you there.

01:18:32.901 --> 01:18:35.902
As long as that gantry
doesn't give way first.

01:18:35.938 --> 01:18:38.839
That would make
my job way easier.

01:18:45.114 --> 01:18:46.580
Have you seen Ro?
Her car is here.

01:18:46.616 --> 01:18:48.549
She was with me, we were
both looking for Ellen Post,

01:18:48.584 --> 01:18:50.017
but then she just disappeared.

01:18:50.052 --> 01:18:51.818
Well, she's not answering
her cell, either.

01:18:51.854 --> 01:18:53.154
When was the last time
you saw her?

01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:54.321
Near the mine entrance.

01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:57.057
Can somebody please find me
Will Weir!

01:18:57.092 --> 01:18:58.992
Anybody seen him?

01:18:59.028 --> 01:19:00.861
Will's not here, either?

01:19:00.929 --> 01:19:01.662
That's not good.

01:19:01.730 --> 01:19:03.230
No, it's not.

01:19:08.404 --> 01:19:09.770
[gasps]

01:19:09.805 --> 01:19:11.705
[beams tumble]

01:19:19.915 --> 01:19:22.916
You forget, I know how
the script ends.

01:19:25.421 --> 01:19:26.887
Two leads grapple
on the ledge,

01:19:26.922 --> 01:19:29.590
one of them falls down to
the waiting air bag below.

01:19:29.625 --> 01:19:35.496
Now, unfortunately,
there's no air bag today.

01:19:35.531 --> 01:19:39.533
Now, honestly, if you fell
because you were snooping around

01:19:39.569 --> 01:19:42.169
all by yourself,
who's gonna blame me?

01:19:42.205 --> 01:19:44.638
I already told the police
about the sugar packets

01:19:44.674 --> 01:19:46.574
so they will definitely
blame you

01:19:46.609 --> 01:19:47.941
if anything else happens here.

01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:49.543
You didn't tell the police,
you told Perry.

01:19:49.579 --> 01:19:50.877
I heard you.

01:19:50.946 --> 01:19:54.114
And when we're done here
he'll be the next to go.

01:19:54.183 --> 01:19:58.151
See, I'll do anything to get
my movie made with Diana.

01:19:58.187 --> 01:20:00.087
We're gonna be a power couple
like Hollywood

01:20:00.122 --> 01:20:01.722
has never seen.

01:20:10.566 --> 01:20:11.965
[screaming]

01:20:12.602 --> 01:20:13.934
[yelps]

01:20:16.372 --> 01:20:17.371
[siren]

01:20:20.643 --> 01:20:21.842
Ro's in the barn with Will Weir.

01:20:21.877 --> 01:20:23.444
He's the killer.

01:20:26.014 --> 01:20:27.948
I got you! I got you!

01:20:31.186 --> 01:20:32.219
I got him.

01:20:32.255 --> 01:20:33.887
Come on, come on.

01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:48.201
Hey.

01:20:48.237 --> 01:20:50.337
[winces]
Easy. Easy.

01:20:50.406 --> 01:20:54.742
Oh, my gosh, and you thought
I was the one who was in danger.

01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:56.510
Thank goodness you're ok.

01:20:56.545 --> 01:20:58.111
And that you were there
to help.

01:20:58.147 --> 01:21:00.547
She did very well
all by herself.

01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:02.182
That's my daughter.

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.096
Robin, you were a good friend
to Celia,

01:21:16.165 --> 01:21:18.599
and you were a good friend
to me, too.

01:21:18.634 --> 01:21:22.269
I'm not surprised you figured
this one out.

01:21:22.338 --> 01:21:23.904
Thank you.

01:21:30.879 --> 01:21:33.013
You should go find Martin.

01:21:54.203 --> 01:21:55.936
Perry called me
to fill me in.

01:21:55.971 --> 01:21:59.707
I'm ok. I really am.

01:21:59.742 --> 01:22:01.875
I'm sorry I didn't call
you sooner.

01:22:01.944 --> 01:22:05.045
You mean before risking
your life instead of after?

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.549
I know you wanna protect me,
that's what I love about you.

01:22:08.617 --> 01:22:12.720
Yeah, but I can't really protect
you if you won't let me.

01:22:13.989 --> 01:22:16.289
Will you at least let me
take you home this time?

01:22:16.325 --> 01:22:17.524
Yes.

01:22:17.593 --> 01:22:19.426
Yes, you can.

01:22:28.838 --> 01:22:31.638
You're going to South America?

01:22:31.674 --> 01:22:33.707
It's not just Rex
that's missing.

01:22:33.743 --> 01:22:35.242
It's his whole family.

01:22:35.277 --> 01:22:36.677
I have to try to find them.

01:22:36.712 --> 01:22:39.946
Or at least find out
who's behind all this.

01:22:44.052 --> 01:22:46.520
It doesn't surprise me.

01:22:46.589 --> 01:22:49.356
You take care of the people
you love.

01:23:07.175 --> 01:23:11.111
I don't know how long
I'll be gone for.

01:23:11.179 --> 01:23:14.848
But you'll let me know you're ok
every chance you get.

01:23:14.917 --> 01:23:16.884
I will. I promise.

01:23:19.855 --> 01:23:21.288
I love you.

01:23:21.323 --> 01:23:23.490
I love you, too.
