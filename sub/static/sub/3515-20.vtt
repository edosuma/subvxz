00:01.040 --> 00:02.485
NICK: Previously on Grimm...

00:02.560 --> 00:03.686
WU: The attack
was pretty violent.

00:03.760 --> 00:04.760
No!

00:04.800 --> 00:07.804
WU: Somebody had a really big
knife and a really bad temper.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.924
NICK: Looks like a black
knight with blood on it.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.240
(BOTH GRUNTING)

00:11.320 --> 00:12.321
She's a Grimm.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.400
You've heard that before?
It doesn't mean anything.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.210
JULIETTE: So, Theresa's
staying for dinner?

00:24.280 --> 00:26.328
TRUBEL: Nobody
calls me "Theresa."

00:26.400 --> 00:28.129
Uh-huh, so what
do they call you?

00:29.240 --> 00:30.651
They call me "Trubel."

00:30.960 --> 00:32.200
"Trubel."

00:32.280 --> 00:35.409
That's an interesting name.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.001
Trubel might have to be staying
with us for a little while.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.370
She needs to lay low.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.566
This have to do with a case?

00:43.640 --> 00:44.641
A little more than that.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.000
And by little more, you mean...

00:46.080 --> 00:47.320
She's a Grimm.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.406
She's a...

00:49.480 --> 00:51.084
Yeah. Sounded just
as weird to me, too.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.408
(CHUCKLING)
You're a Grimm, but...

00:53.480 --> 00:54.641
She just found out.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.571
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:57.640 --> 00:58.971
Excuse us.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.890
How do you just find
out you're a Grimm?

01:04.319 --> 01:05.560
Uh, sort of like me.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.007
I had no idea what I was
until Aunt Marie told me,

01:08.120 --> 01:09.645
and she's never had
anybody tell her.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.371
Then how do you
know she's a Grimm?

01:11.440 --> 01:13.886
Monroe saw her.
Monroe saw her?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.331
And she killed three Wesen.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.209
She's a murder suspect?

01:17.320 --> 01:19.402
Well, not technically a suspect,
because we know she did it,

01:19.480 --> 01:21.244
but it was self-defense.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.601
They attacked her.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.081
She has no idea what she is,
let alone what they were.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.731
First, your mom shows up
with Adalind and a baby.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.723
And now you bring home a Grimm
who barely knows she's a Grimm,

01:29.800 --> 01:31.131
and she's killed three Wesen.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.770
I know it's a lot.
You think?

01:33.360 --> 01:35.362
She's been on the run for years.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.363
I mean, she thought
she was crazy.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.805
She just needs a little help.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.009
You really think
you can help her?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.806
I took her to the trailer, tried to
explain what she was as best I could,

01:43.920 --> 01:46.366
but that's a lot to take in for
someone as young as she is.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.327
Juliette, she just
needs a warm bed,

01:49.400 --> 01:52.006
a roof and a little
understanding.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.125
For how long?

01:56.040 --> 01:57.769
Well, a little While.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.725
I think we're gonna
have to play it by ear.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.801
Where is she?

02:02.360 --> 02:03.885
Trubel!

02:14.560 --> 02:15.766
(SIGHING)

02:17.440 --> 02:18.566
Sorry.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.645
It's okay.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.485
Why don't we try some silverware
and eat at the table, though?

02:24.080 --> 02:26.367
It's been a while since
late with other people.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.928
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

02:36.840 --> 02:37.841

02:44.360 --> 02:45.566
I am so sorry.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.766
That's all right.
Lam so sorry...

02:46.840 --> 02:48.888
It's just an accident.
We'll take care of it.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.441
Security. I'm gonna need
to see what's in your bag.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.521

03:28.200 --> 03:29.440
Something go wrong?

03:33.280 --> 03:36.523
I'll take that as a yes.
Where's Cammy?

03:36.600 --> 03:37.840
She, um...

03:39.320 --> 03:41.527
She made a mistake.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.687
Was she caught?

03:52.720 --> 03:55.564
Was Cammy caught?

03:55.640 --> 03:57.165
I saw her run away.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.401
And you didn't go after her?

03:58.880 --> 04:02.407
We... We thought she'd
meet us back here.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.324
We'll discuss it upstairs.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.488
Bless this family and this
food we are about to eat.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.726
We take nothing for granted,

04:10.800 --> 04:13.565
for we know that our strength comes
from putting the family first.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.723
For no sacrifice is too great...

04:15.800 --> 04:17.370
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

04:29.120 --> 04:31.168
I know. Come on.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.890
It wasn't my fault.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.640
I know.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.167
Why don't we talk about
this in private, okay?

04:47.720 --> 04:49.210
(DOOR OPENING)

04:55.040 --> 04:56.963
At least I got away.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.088
You shouldn't
have gotten caught.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.401
I won't get caught again.

05:01.560 --> 05:04.609
Please. I came home.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.923
And where else would you go?

05:09.400 --> 05:12.165
Look at me.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.723
This is your family.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.648

05:56.440 --> 05:58.647
So, are all of
the Grimms so normal?

05:59.120 --> 06:01.043
You should meet my mother.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.610
She's been called
a lot of things,

06:02.680 --> 06:04.444
but normal's not one of 'em.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.284
Does that mean we're related?

06:08.120 --> 06:09.406
Maybe a few centuries ago.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.969
From what I can tell,
it's like a recessive gene.

No, I'm not a Grimm.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.680
So, how do you deal with this?

06:27.560 --> 06:28.971
Deal with what?

06:30.600 --> 06:33.080
Being married to someone
who can see what we do?

out what to do.

call me, okay?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.448
I don't want you to go.

You need to stay here with me.

I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

Of course, I'm afraid of you.

Well, I'm afraid of you, too.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.050
Then why do you want me to stay?

07:49.040 --> 07:52.726
Because I'm more
afraid of being alone.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.561

I don't anymore.

But for the short
time I had her,

08:09.040 --> 08:11.520
I felt something
I've never felt before.

be well looked after.

end up if you walk out on this.

you've been living in.

I can help.

and you didn't.

quite worked this out,

12:33.160 --> 12:36.528
we might want to get these other
introductions out of the way.

12:36.840 --> 12:41.084
So, why don't we just start
with explaining what a Woge is?

12:41.160 --> 12:42.241
I know what it is.

12:42.880 --> 12:47.169
Okay, well, there's
also, like, um, stages.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.401
So, there's Kehrseiten.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.926
And they are non-Wesen,
non-Grimm types.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.206
That would be me.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.570
And they can only see us
when we want them to.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.880
And Grimms like you,

12:58.120 --> 13:00.407
on the other hand,
also can see us

13:00.480 --> 13:02.528
when we don't wanna be seen.

13:04.880 --> 13:05.927
You ready?

It's your eyes.

They get really
dark when we Woge.

Yeah, we're not
talking kiddy pool dark.

wasn't real, I made it up.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.449
Well, honey, you didn't.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.928
Look, this is new for all of us.

Nick is the first Grimm
who didn't try to kill us.

So, this is as
important for Monroe and me

14:37.320 --> 14:38.845

But not all Wesen are like us.

So, you need to be careful.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.971
Okay.

We gotta go. There's
a body in Forest Park.

We can take her with us.

went through probate.

It was determined at that time that
your mother had not filed taxes

to pay the storage unit

been stored as per your request.

of value for you in there.

they were made by a blade.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.286
Looks like puncture wounds.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.686
Doesn't look like she's
got a drop of blood left.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.724
I don't know.
What was it?

25:36.520 --> 25:38.329
She met a woman named Donna.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.886
Free rent and good clothes, and she
didn't have to hook or anything.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.201
Donna. Okay.
Where do I find her?

25:44.080 --> 25:45.730
She met her at O'Bryant Square.

That's who gave her the job.

and a place to crash.

becoming a liability.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.203
I'm just not used
to being the hunter.

41:01.320 --> 41:05.086
And I guess I got carried away.

41:06.880 --> 41:10.805
I need to know more. I hope
you're still willing to help me.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.284
Why don't we talk
about it in the morning?

41:19.720 --> 41:21.882
Okay.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.561
You look like you
could use some sleep.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.526
You kind of do.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.891
(SIGHING)

41:58.600 --> 41:59.931
(COUGHING)

42:05.320 --> 42:06.606
(COUGHING)
