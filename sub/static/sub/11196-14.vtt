00:30.679 --> 00:32.399
Go!

00:57.679 --> 00:59.640
Let's go.

01:38.079 --> 01:40.040
Where's Teal'c?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.920
I don't know, sir.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.439
He was right behind me.

02:50.319 --> 02:53.639
- Colonel, are you OK?
- We have to go back, sir.

02:54.599 --> 02:59.159
- What was your situation?
- Pursued by gliders and an al-kesh.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.599
Teal'c was with me.
He could still be alive.

03:01.960 --> 03:05.080
Dial P3X-1 16.
We'll try and raise him on his radio.

03:10.159 --> 03:14.120
- Chevron one encoded.
- Sir, we should have a MALP standing by.

03:14.439 --> 03:16.159
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

03:17.039 --> 03:18.960
Chevron two encoded.

03:19.599 --> 03:22.479
Sir, we're getting an unknown error.

03:24.879 --> 03:26.680
- Sir, should I override?
- Major?

03:26.879 --> 03:30.759
The system is detecting something wrong
with the Stargate itself,

03:30.879 --> 03:32.879
not our dialling computer.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.560
- Chevron four encoded.
- Like what?

03:35.680 --> 03:39.560
I don't know. It's something
our computer isn't recognising.

03:40.879 --> 03:43.120
Sir, what happened
before you came through?

03:43.240 --> 03:47.280
- The ship was comin' right at us.
- Could it have impacted the Stargate?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.319
And if it did?

03:50.120 --> 03:54.919
I hate to say this, but if the wormhole was
shut down while Teal'c was en route, it...

03:55.039 --> 03:57.919
Chevron six encoded.
Still showing "unknown error", sir.

03:58.039 --> 03:59.599
Sir, we'd better abort.

03:59.759 --> 04:04.400
- Abort the dialling procedure.
- Dialling sequence aborted, sir.

04:12.520 --> 04:17.639
The Tok'ra intel was right. The Goa'ulds
were scouting P3X-1 16 for a new base.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.360
Looks that way. The Tok'ra didn't
tell us that the Goa'uld was Tanith.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.600
We spotted him on the ground near his
al-kesh with a small contingent of Jaffa.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.519
- He came after you himself?
- Yeah. As you know,

04:29.600 --> 04:32.720
he and Teal'c have
this kind of thing between them, so...

04:32.800 --> 04:36.000
Sir, I think I know what the problem is.
We have to act quickly.

04:36.079 --> 04:37.480
What is it?

04:37.600 --> 04:39.639
The Stargate turns matter into energy

04:39.759 --> 04:42.639
and then transmits it
through a subspace wormhole.

04:42.759 --> 04:44.560
That's Gate Travel 101 .

04:44.639 --> 04:47.759
The receiving gate
translates the energy signature

04:47.839 --> 04:50.800
- and reconverts it into its original form.
- Major.

04:50.879 --> 04:55.240
The Stargate has massive amounts
of memory. It's like a computer buffer.

04:55.360 --> 04:59.480
It temporarily stores the energy patterns
before it reconverts them into matter.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.399
This ensures it has all the information
before it reassembles the object

05:03.519 --> 05:06.160
or, in our case, a person.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.439
The error we're receiving from the gate

05:08.560 --> 05:12.600
indicates there is still an energy pattern
stored in the memory buffer.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.240
- Teal'c.
- If the al-kesh crashed into the DHD,

05:17.360 --> 05:21.639
it would cut off power to the outgoing
gate. The wormhole would be severed.

05:21.720 --> 05:26.160
If it happened before our gate reconverted
Teal'c's energy signature into matter...

05:26.240 --> 05:30.600
- Teal'c is in our Stargate.
- His energy signature, yes.

05:32.519 --> 05:35.959
- Let's get him out.
- Right now, I'm not sure how.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.160
- That's not the worst problem.
- There's worse.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.199
The Stargate has safety protocols,

05:44.319 --> 05:47.360
designed to prevent energy signatures
mixing together.

05:47.480 --> 05:51.959
It does this by erasing the memory buffer
each time a new wormhole is established.

05:52.639 --> 05:55.000
It's like an overall system reset.

05:55.120 --> 05:59.560
Sir, if we dial out of our gate
or somebody off world tries dialling in...

05:59.680 --> 06:03.879
- We have eight teams on missions.
- Teal'c's energy signature will be erased.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Permanently.

06:06.519 --> 06:09.319
- How do we stop an incoming wormhole?
- Right now,

06:09.399 --> 06:13.040
the iris sits in front of the plane
where the event horizon is formed.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.879
Now if we can rig it
so we can offset it just slightly,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.279
we would stop a wormhole
from establishing.

06:18.399 --> 06:20.800
It would be like burying our gate.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.360
Siler says his team
can have it done in an hour.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.120
How do we get our people home?

06:26.199 --> 06:30.399
When Russia had its DHD connected,
it became the dominant gate on Earth.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.879
Exactly. All incoming wormholes
automatically went there.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.360
- I'll call the Pentagon.
- I'll see when the next SG team is due.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.480
We have eight teams off world
we have to get home.

06:54.560 --> 06:59.000
It's a temporary situation we hope
to have resolved as quickly as possible.

07:00.439 --> 07:04.720
Thank you, sir. I'll get our best man
for the job on a plane right away.

07:07.399 --> 07:11.439
The next team due to check in is SG-5.
They have a scheduled report at 1600.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.519
Less than an hour from now.
Will the iris be in place?

07:14.600 --> 07:17.079
They're working as fast as they can.

07:17.199 --> 07:19.560
The best man I was talking about is you.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.160
We need a liaison in Russia
to help coordinate our interests.

07:23.279 --> 07:25.839
Pack a bag. You leave in half an hour.

07:38.279 --> 07:39.519
Carter.

07:39.639 --> 07:41.600
Sir, are you OK?

07:41.720 --> 07:46.720
Oh, a couple of stitches, concussion,
nausea, dizziness. The usual.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.959
Why is Teal'c still in the gate?

07:54.680 --> 07:57.040
Well, sir, it's very complicated.

07:57.839 --> 08:00.399
Can I help?

08:02.600 --> 08:07.480
We had to create a proper interface
between the gate and our computer.

08:07.600 --> 08:12.120
We gave instructions based on electrical
impulses to make the gate respond.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.800
These were found by trial and error
over a great deal of time.

08:15.920 --> 08:21.279
We now need to find impulses to instruct
the gate to override a primary function.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.079
Can I get you some coffee?

08:31.519 --> 08:35.879
Sir, the truth is, the gate may not even
be capable of doing what we need it to do.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.679
Which is what?

08:37.799 --> 08:40.360
Resume a reintegration process
that was cut off.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.519
Carter, my head.

08:42.639 --> 08:45.039
Sir, I'm sorry,
but the more I go through this,

08:45.159 --> 08:49.799
the more I'm becoming concerned that we
may not even be able to get Teal'c back.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.679
Oh.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.799
(speak Russian)

09:27.919 --> 09:29.639
- Major Davis.
- Colonel.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.440
- Dr Jackson.
- Colonel.

09:31.519 --> 09:34.720
- Pleasant trip?
- As possible, under the circumstances.

09:34.799 --> 09:38.279
Yes, yes, an unfortunate problem.
Please, sit down.

09:40.799 --> 09:45.799
The details made available to me
were somewhat vague, only that a...

09:47.519 --> 09:52.480
technical glitch had somehow trapped
one of your team inside the Stargate.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.720
That's pretty much
all we know at the moment.

09:55.799 --> 09:58.759
Then we are not the only ones
incapable of handling

09:58.879 --> 10:02.279
every situation the Stargate
may present, after all.

10:02.399 --> 10:07.080
- What is the status of offworld teams?
- All have been contacted successfully.

10:07.200 --> 10:12.639
- SG-5 and SG-8 have arrived safely.
- We do appreciate what you're doing.

10:12.840 --> 10:17.679
Despite appearances, our participation
in this effort is not one of good faith.

10:17.799 --> 10:21.279
The Russian military
is not here to do your bidding.

10:21.399 --> 10:23.200
I wasn't suggesting you were.

10:23.320 --> 10:28.159
Your government thinks it can dictate
protocol regarding Stargate technology.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.519
Our governments do have a deal.

10:30.639 --> 10:34.240
One which has been ignored
by both sides, wouldn't you agree?

10:34.360 --> 10:39.159
It is impossible to run concurrent
Stargate programmes... Colonel.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.879
By the sounds of it,
it may be impossible not to, Major.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.120
Colonel?

11:07.519 --> 11:09.320
Colonel?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.960
Go home.

11:15.399 --> 11:17.879
I'm all right, sir.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.720
Just got five minutes of quality sleep.

11:23.240 --> 11:26.120
Everything that can be done
is being done.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.120
You know, this wouldn't be happening
if he had followed orders.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.399
It's that damn Jaffa revenge thing.

11:37.399 --> 11:40.639
Get some rest, Colonel. That's an order.

11:53.639 --> 11:55.600
Colonel Simmons.

11:57.279 --> 12:01.720
Hello, General. I was just introducing
Major Carter and Dr McKay.

12:02.120 --> 12:06.759
The doctor has been studying
the Stargate programme out of Area 51 .

12:07.600 --> 12:09.679
Without access to a working gate.

12:09.799 --> 12:13.120
I had a computer model,
built when the second gate was there.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.519
I'm sure it's a thrill to be here
to see the real thing.

12:17.679 --> 12:19.759
Not really.

12:19.879 --> 12:23.759
Pentagon feels that Dr McKay is
the world's foremost expert on the gate.

12:23.879 --> 12:27.360
- Next to Major Carter.
- With all due respect, Major,

12:27.480 --> 12:31.240
- your time is spent in the field.
- She spent two years working on the gate

12:31.360 --> 12:34.639
prior to her five years of service
at the SGC.

12:34.759 --> 12:37.120
She's the one who made
this programme viable.

12:37.240 --> 12:40.679
Actually, the interface
she designed is full of flaws.

12:40.799 --> 12:42.919
I admit it's not perfect, but it's...

12:43.039 --> 12:46.559
It has caused situations which
could have ended in catastrophe.

12:46.679 --> 12:50.240
We don't want that to happen.
That's why the doctor is here to help.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.000
Good. He can report to Major Carter.

12:53.120 --> 12:57.080
They might be able to work together
to solve this problem, to get Teal'c back -

12:57.200 --> 12:59.080
in the time allotted.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.320
Excuse me? ln the time allotted?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.960
- 48 hours.
- Sir.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.039
Come with me, Colonel.

13:14.879 --> 13:19.159
I don't care who you are or who you work
for. You will not dictate procedure to me.

13:19.240 --> 13:23.200
General, don't shoot the messenger.
I'm just bringing you your orders.

13:23.279 --> 13:27.720
Teal'c is an invaluable asset. Without
him, you might not be sitting there,

13:27.799 --> 13:30.000
supposedly representing your country.

13:30.120 --> 13:34.919
We're all aware of his contributions,
as well as his questionable allegiances.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.279
This operation,
we've lost good Americans.

13:38.399 --> 13:42.039
You're not telling me you hold Teal'c's life
above one of our own people?

13:42.159 --> 13:45.440
Teal'c is one of our own,
and his life is not lost yet.

13:45.559 --> 13:50.440
Maybe not, but my sources tell me
that all the offworld teams are home safe.

13:50.559 --> 13:54.519
Now the Pentagon is not willing to deal
with the Russians over the long term.

13:54.639 --> 13:57.200
And in the past you yourself
have made a strong case

13:57.320 --> 14:01.840
for keeping the SGC alive and running
at all costs. And we agree with you.

14:02.919 --> 14:06.240
So these people must come up with
a solution in the next two days,

14:06.360 --> 14:10.399
or you will be ordered to resume
sending teams through the gate.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.879
All of your teams are safe.
That is what we agreed to help you with.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.240
Now we need to send one
of our teams on a fact-finding mission.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.799
Our offworld allies
may know how to save Teal'c.

14:22.919 --> 14:25.559
- Your offworld allies?
- Allies of Earth.

14:25.639 --> 14:28.080
As long as our gate is connected,
Dr Jackson,

14:28.200 --> 14:30.919
we, the Russian people,
are vulnerable to attack.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.639
We are here to ensure that the orders
agreed by our leaders are carried out.

14:35.759 --> 14:37.720
We're not here to negotiate, Colonel.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.879
On the contrary, Major,
that is exactly why you are here.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.240
The deal so unwisely
made by my government

14:43.360 --> 14:46.159
requires us to cease
our operations of the Stargate,

14:46.279 --> 14:49.320
not make it available to you
whenever you deem it necessary.

14:49.399 --> 14:51.120
If you wish to use our technology,

14:51.240 --> 14:55.120
you must present something
of significant value in return.

14:59.519 --> 15:01.480
Hi, Jack.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.440
You rat bastard!

15:04.559 --> 15:06.519
Hey, take it easy.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.679
- I'm so gonna kick your ass!
- There's people watching.

15:09.799 --> 15:13.440
- I don't care!
- It wasn't me. I didn't shoot you.

15:13.559 --> 15:17.240
- I trusted you!
- Would I come back here if I'd done it?

15:17.360 --> 15:20.159
- You might!
- I swear, Jack.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.720
- Then who did it?
- I don't know.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.039
- What do you know?
- Just what I read in the NID file.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.960
That you got shot
and the Goa'uld escaped.

15:29.039 --> 15:33.320
You came all the way back to Colorado
Springs to tell me you didn't do it?

15:33.679 --> 15:37.720
I didn't think you'd believe me
any other way. And I wanted to warn you.

15:37.799 --> 15:40.759
- About what?
- I heard about Teal'c.

15:40.879 --> 15:43.519
- What about it?
- I hope you get him back.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.480
- And the warning part?
- Watch out for Frank Simmons.

15:47.559 --> 15:50.200
Simmons again. What is it with you guys?

15:50.320 --> 15:53.039
We go back.
I don't exactly know what he's up to,

15:53.120 --> 15:57.399
but I can guarantee you it isn't
gonna be good for Teal'c or the SGC.

15:57.519 --> 16:00.159
- Great.
- I'll be in town for a couple of days.

16:00.240 --> 16:05.360
I'd like to see how things turn out. I'm at
the Accent lnn, in the name of Cassidy.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.759
David or Shaun?

16:07.879 --> 16:09.960
Butch.

16:10.600 --> 16:15.120
You know, Simmons says you're the one
who sullied the good name of the NID.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.200
Do you believe that?

16:22.399 --> 16:23.799
No.

16:24.759 --> 16:26.960
Trust me, Jack. I know him well.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.519
I'm the one who recruited him.

16:37.799 --> 16:38.960
Thanks.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.799
Major.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.320
- Doctor.
- I guess that we got off on the wrong foot.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.639
What probability factor
did you use figuring that out?

16:48.759 --> 16:51.720
For the record,
I don't work for Colonel Simmons.

16:51.840 --> 16:56.200
- What difference does that make?
- I sensed a little tension there.

16:56.279 --> 16:59.080
I'm on the air force payroll.
I report to the chief of staff.

16:59.159 --> 17:01.039
That changes everything.

17:01.159 --> 17:04.519
I just wanted to give you
my honest analysis, Major.

17:04.640 --> 17:08.400
It is a waste of time to assume
that you're right about everything.

17:08.519 --> 17:11.799
Leaving more time
to devote to your fan club.

17:12.358 --> 17:15.160
The gate shouldn't be used
without a dialling device.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.640
Your computer system ignores
220 of the 400 feedback signals

17:18.759 --> 17:21.118
the gate can emit
during a dialling sequence.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.799
It is a fluke that you picked up
the buffer warning.

17:23.920 --> 17:28.358
I'm surprised that you bothered aborting
the dialling sequence, despite the error.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.400
What is that supposed to mean?

17:30.519 --> 17:35.519
I read the reports, Major. You've bypassed
dialling protocols on several occasions.

17:35.640 --> 17:39.200
My job is to present the risks,
not to decide whether to take them.

17:39.319 --> 17:43.440
Now if you have something positive
to add, do it. Otherwise, get out of my lab.

17:43.519 --> 17:45.559
- Well...
- (phone rings)

17:45.680 --> 17:46.640
Carter.

17:46.960 --> 17:50.279
Hey, Sam, we got the Russians
to let us send one team out.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.680
- SG-5 contacted the Tok'ra. They're back.
- What did they say?

17:53.799 --> 17:56.920
They said the glitch occurred
because we don't have a DHD.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.799
They said a local DHD
would compensate for the loss of power

17:59.920 --> 18:02.119
and allow the gate to finish the process.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.720
If the DHD could have prevented the
problem, maybe the DHD can also fix it.

18:06.839 --> 18:10.039
Is there a chance you can get
the Russians to give us theirDHD?

18:10.359 --> 18:12.640
This is impossible at the moment.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.880
- Not without giving back Alaska.
- That bad, huh?

18:16.960 --> 18:19.279
Yeah. The Tok'ra said
that connecting a DHD now

18:19.400 --> 18:21.519
might not get Teal'c out of the memory.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.359
It could impose the reset protocol,
like dialling in.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.480
- Yeah.
- How did the Tok'ra suggest we fix it?

18:27.599 --> 18:31.880
They don't know. They said they'd work
on it, but not how long that might take.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.119
- Sorry I don't have betternews.
- Yeah. Me, too.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.240
Thanks, Daniel. Bye.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.960
Thank you. I will.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.000
- Can I come in?
- Do I have a choice?

18:54.799 --> 18:58.039
Clock's ticking.
You have less than 32 hours.

18:58.839 --> 19:01.799
You didn't close the door
just to tell me that, did you?

19:01.920 --> 19:05.319
The way I see it,
despite their combined brain powers,

19:05.440 --> 19:09.079
Major Carter and Dr McKay won't
solve this problem in the time allotted.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.000
I'm working on extending that.

19:14.519 --> 19:16.920
Why are you really here, Colonel?

19:20.680 --> 19:25.160
I can provide you with the information
that you're gonna need to save Teal'c.

19:25.559 --> 19:27.440
- How?
- That's not important.

19:27.559 --> 19:32.079
- It damn well is.
- What's important is that it's not for free.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.000
Are you speaking on behalf of the NID?
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

19:37.119 --> 19:38.920
Stick to the point.

19:39.039 --> 19:43.680
I'm trying to count how many crimes you
might be committing right now, Colonel.

19:43.799 --> 19:45.759
General, you have two options.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.839
You can either give me what I want -

19:47.960 --> 19:51.279
a small token compared to
what's at stake, at least for you -

19:51.400 --> 19:55.680
or I guess you could call your superiors
and report this conversation.

19:55.799 --> 19:58.920
At which point I would deny everything.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.119
I'm thinking of having
you arrested this instant.

20:03.400 --> 20:09.240
Well, you go ahead. And I guarantee you
you'll never see Teal'c again.

20:18.319 --> 20:20.119
(knocking on door)

20:38.680 --> 20:40.799
I could take care of him for you.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.880
- What?
- Simmons.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.640
I could make sure he's never a problem
again. I'm already wanted for treason.

20:47.759 --> 20:50.400
OK, I'll just pretend you didn't say that.

20:50.519 --> 20:52.960
Bet it was him who shot you.

20:55.799 --> 21:00.319
The son of a bitch stood in Hammond's
office and blackmailed him to his face?

21:00.440 --> 21:03.240
- Yeah.
- You got to admire that.

21:03.319 --> 21:05.319
What'd he ask for?

21:05.440 --> 21:07.880
A Goa'uld hand device.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.200
Might as well admit that
they have the Goa'uld that escaped.

21:11.279 --> 21:13.640
- We're hopin'.
- Why?

21:13.759 --> 21:17.440
- He might tell us what he told Simmons.
- You have to find him first.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.400
Oh.

21:23.079 --> 21:25.559
This is unacceptable.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.720
We allowed all your teams
to return home safely.

21:30.079 --> 21:34.039
We even allowed you to send out another
team on a new reconnaissance mission.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.359
We expect nothing less
than everything on that list in return.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.920
Your government agreed
to allow us to use your gate, period.

21:41.039 --> 21:43.359
It mentioned nothing of any demands.

21:43.480 --> 21:48.920
Russia will not allow you to operate
your programme without our involvement.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.519
We demand that a Russian team
be permanently stationed at your base,

21:52.759 --> 21:55.640
that all mission files
go through our on-site officer,

21:55.759 --> 21:58.240
and that all technologies developed

21:58.359 --> 22:02.640
as a result of Stargate travel past, present
and future will be shared equally.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.880
Or what?

22:06.000 --> 22:10.119
We know your government has
no interest in running its own programme.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.440
Political winds change, Major.
And don't forget,

22:13.559 --> 22:18.039
with a DHD we can ensure that our base
has the dominant operational gate.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.559
You do realise, sir,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.519
that what you said
could be interpreted as an act of war.

22:25.039 --> 22:30.000
How can the US go to war over something
its people know nothing about?

22:30.160 --> 22:32.599
It wouldn't be unprecedented, Colonel.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.119
What would it take
for you to give us your DHD?

22:37.680 --> 22:40.119
No, seriously. Let's put it on the table.

22:41.599 --> 22:45.240
You think of the DHD as a bargaining
chip, but everything has a price

22:45.359 --> 22:49.400
and no-one said exactly what it would
take to buy you out in full, right now.

22:49.519 --> 22:53.160
- Dr Jackson...
- No, no. He has a good point, Major.

22:53.279 --> 22:55.240
The problem is, Dr Jackson,

22:55.359 --> 23:00.079
that without full disclosure
of technologies procured by the SGC,

23:00.920 --> 23:03.880
it may be impossible
to determine a reasonable price.

23:13.319 --> 23:16.920
Didn't the NID trace you down
the last time you did this?

23:17.440 --> 23:21.200
This time I'm using a linkup
that's bouncing off five satellites.

23:21.319 --> 23:24.279
If they pick something up,
tracing it'll make 'em dizzy.

23:24.400 --> 23:29.119
- What are we looking for?
- The NID have bases for their special ops.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.279
Call 'em safe houses.

23:31.799 --> 23:33.880
Legitimate organisation.

23:34.039 --> 23:36.599
It's the only way
we're gonna find this Goa'uld.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.680
- What do you mean?
- Through legitimate NID operations.

23:42.359 --> 23:46.039
Unofficial business is financed privately
and can be kept off the books,

23:46.160 --> 23:51.440
but any official NID action has to be filed
with the Pentagon, same as the military.

23:51.559 --> 23:54.680
If Simmons used an NID plane
to visit our snakehead,

23:54.799 --> 23:57.160
then the flight plan was registered.

23:57.279 --> 23:59.599
Wouldn't that be stupid?

23:59.720 --> 24:02.839
Teal'c's situation provided
Simmons with an opportunity,

24:02.920 --> 24:05.799
but the Pentagon's deadline
didn't give him much time.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.279
Besides, NID flight plans are classified,

24:08.400 --> 24:12.599
and there aren't many people who know
the location of every NID safe house.

24:17.279 --> 24:21.240
You just happen to be lucky enough
to know one of the few who does.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.680
He diverted to Minot,
on his way to Colorado Springs?

24:28.799 --> 24:31.359
North Dakota ain't exactly on the way.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.079
There's no switch.

24:35.160 --> 24:39.880
The crystals are wiped clean by an
unstable vortex of a forming wormhole.

24:41.680 --> 24:46.200
Do you have any idea how much excess
energy one of those blasts gives off?

24:47.599 --> 24:49.559
As a matter of fact, I do.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.960
We need to establish
an event horizon without the vortex.

24:53.079 --> 24:54.799
- Impossible.
- I've seen it done.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.960
By magical fairy beans?
ls there lemon on the chicken?

24:58.079 --> 25:00.039
It's lemon chicken.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.519
So it is. I am mortally allergic to citrus.

25:03.599 --> 25:07.319
One drop of lemon and I could die.
I'll have whatever that is.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.519
I have to be very careful.

25:20.960 --> 25:26.240
So, what would this...
fictional event horizon be connected to?

25:27.319 --> 25:28.480
Hungry?

25:29.599 --> 25:31.400
Starving.

25:31.480 --> 25:35.599
This is even worse than it looks,
but it beats a hypoglycaemic reaction.

25:38.240 --> 25:42.119
The event horizon dematerialises you
and sends you into the wormhole.

25:42.240 --> 25:46.279
Maybe we don't need to connect
to a wormhole to form an event horizon.

25:46.359 --> 25:49.160
Maybe, somehow, someway.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.880
All we do is get
the rematerialisation process to work.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.559
Major,

25:53.640 --> 25:57.839
even if you created a viable event horizon
without connecting to a wormhole,

25:57.960 --> 26:00.519
- the gate wouldn't reintegrate Teal'c.
- Why not?

26:00.640 --> 26:04.519
The crystals that retain
the energy pattern before reintegration?

26:04.599 --> 26:08.640
- They're not like magnetic hard drives.
- I know. They're crystals.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.720
You can't just ignore
the laws of thermodynamics.

26:11.839 --> 26:14.880
Entropy dictates crystals
won't retain energy patterns.

26:14.960 --> 26:18.480
I've measured it.
It's what's called "quantitative evidence".

26:18.599 --> 26:22.480
I think the energy is unimportant
past its initial imprint on the crystals.

26:22.559 --> 26:24.680
And this fantasy is based on...?

26:26.240 --> 26:30.880
I think the gate stores its ones and zeros
on a subatomic level within the crystals.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.440
So even though the energy is dissipating,
the most recent pattern still exists.

26:35.519 --> 26:37.240
You think.

26:37.359 --> 26:40.400
We're dealing with quantum physics
that is way beyond us.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.759
More than a third of the energy that the
gate requires to reintegrate Teal'c is gone.

26:44.839 --> 26:48.319
- I don't think so.
- You're guessing wildly, like always.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.640
Maybe you could fool the gate into
reintegrating what's stored in its memory,

26:52.759 --> 26:55.119
- but you won't like what comes out.
- We'll see.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.359
Major, Teal'c is dead,
and this argument is a waste of time.

26:58.440 --> 27:03.039
The Pentagon is gonna order Hammond
to resume operations in, what, 16 hours?

27:03.599 --> 27:06.480
That's how they came up
with the 48-hour deadline.

27:06.599 --> 27:08.920
You told them Teal'c
would already be dead.

27:09.039 --> 27:11.519
That's why it's called a deadline.

27:12.039 --> 27:15.359
- God, you're a jerk.
- I wish I didn't find you so attractive.

27:16.839 --> 27:20.039
I always had a real weakness
for... dumb blondes.

27:21.319 --> 27:23.400
Go suck a lemon.

27:24.039 --> 27:26.839
Very sexy. Very, very sexy.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.880
(beeping)

28:01.240 --> 28:04.359
We have a breach in the perimeter.
Section R9.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.839
(man) It's probably
that damn squirrel again.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.319
You better take backup, Joe.

28:11.599 --> 28:13.079
Joe, report.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.799
Joe?

28:19.839 --> 28:22.880
- Paul, check on Joe. Take Peter.
- We're on it.

28:25.720 --> 28:28.440
We have a power failure
here at home base.

28:28.559 --> 28:30.920
I'm switching to backup generator.

28:35.680 --> 28:40.599
We have a red alert. Backup generator
is down. System is inoperational.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.880
Repeat, the system is down.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.720
Ron, get to the generator.
Find out what's goin' on.

28:45.799 --> 28:48.039
Paul, Peter, report.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.119
What's goin' on?

29:09.279 --> 29:11.640
OK, Jack, I'm in. Hit it.

29:26.279 --> 29:29.079
You got two guys left,
guarding the Goa'uld.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.640
- (distorted) We meet again.
- Yeah.

29:54.079 --> 29:55.480
Now what?

29:55.559 --> 29:58.359
Now you're going to tell me
what I want to know.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.319
Look, they did
what we asked in good faith.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.680
All they're asking for is what
we already promised to give them.

30:17.799 --> 30:20.359
- Have you lost your mind?
- Should we talk in here?

30:20.440 --> 30:23.960
The room is bugged, but they already
know everything we're saying.

30:24.079 --> 30:26.640
And they might as well know
that we will never

30:26.720 --> 30:29.279
turn over refined
weapons-grade naqahdah.

30:29.400 --> 30:33.440
I'm talking about naqahdah generator
technology, a safe source of power.

30:33.519 --> 30:36.319
Which requires refined naqahdah to work.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.440
You of all people realise
the explosive power of it.

30:39.559 --> 30:44.160
So they can blow us up 200 times over
instead of 100. What's the difference?

30:44.839 --> 30:46.400
The difference is,

30:46.480 --> 30:50.240
it would only take one nuke to
get through an antiballistic shield to do it.

30:50.359 --> 30:55.200
The point is that you already owe them
the generator technology anyway.

30:55.319 --> 30:59.839
The point is, we are not giving them the
technology, they're not giving us the DHD.

30:59.960 --> 31:03.920
Can't we supervise how the naqahdah
is used? They want to monitor the gate.

31:04.039 --> 31:06.480
That's not the point.

31:09.039 --> 31:12.240
Isn't a more economically stable Russia
better for everyone?

31:12.359 --> 31:15.480
We don't know
who they'll sell the technology to.

31:15.599 --> 31:18.559
So all this time we've been using
the gate to save the world,

31:18.640 --> 31:20.799
we've really only been saving the US of A.

31:20.920 --> 31:24.799
Dammit, we don't even know for sure
if the DHD will even save Teal'c.

31:24.920 --> 31:29.599
Naqahdah generator technology
is years from widespread implementation.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.680
In the meantime, we get the DHD

31:31.799 --> 31:36.359
and prevent the Russians from ever
holding their gate over us ever again.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.640
That's exactly why
the Russians'll never go for it.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.559
Let's ask.

31:52.559 --> 31:54.960
- Get me in here.
- Careful, Jack.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.039
Just do it.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.440
All right,

32:08.559 --> 32:10.839
tell me what you told Simmons.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.839
(distorted) What in particular
are you referring to?

32:19.920 --> 32:22.720
- How do we save Teal'c?
- Why should I tell you?

32:22.799 --> 32:26.440
- Because if you don't, I'll kill you.
- I doubt that.

32:32.319 --> 32:36.000
What makes you think
I care if you live or die?

32:36.119 --> 32:37.599
What about the host?

32:37.720 --> 32:42.000
He tried to kill a friend of mine to save his
own ass, so I don't care about him either.

32:42.119 --> 32:44.920
If you kill me, Teal'c dies.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.559
Give me another choice.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.319
Let me go.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.759
Once I am free, I will contact you
with the information.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.119
I think Teal'c would rather I shoot you.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.200
Oh, go ahead.

33:16.319 --> 33:21.119
You know, Colonel Simmons
was really much better at this than you.

33:21.240 --> 33:25.799
He at least offered something of value
in return for what I know.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.359
Thank you.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.640
I don't understand.

33:51.119 --> 33:53.559
There's a camera in that cell.

33:56.519 --> 33:59.079
It would have been from two days ago.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.839
Got it.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.039
- It's what you want.
- Not everything.

34:20.400 --> 34:24.840
And we acknowledge that the past
arrangement was ignored by both sides.

34:24.920 --> 34:29.039
What we're saying is that
we're willing to try and make it work now.

34:29.159 --> 34:33.518
Allow our team access to your base and
all information relating to the Stargate.

34:33.599 --> 34:36.559
After a month
we will assess delivery of the DHD.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.440
Wait, that's... that's not good enough.

34:39.559 --> 34:42.039
This is not a negotiation.
We need that DHD now.

34:42.159 --> 34:46.599
Someone's life is at stake, a good friend
of mine. That DHD could help save him.

34:46.679 --> 34:51.440
When your team went missing, SG-1 ,
with that friend, tried to rescue them.

34:51.599 --> 34:54.800
Yes, and in the process,
three more Russian soldiers died.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.518
That's not our fault.

34:56.599 --> 35:00.159
Colonel Zukov was a friend of mine,
and he is now dead, Doctor.

35:00.280 --> 35:03.000
Then you must know how I feel.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.800
Look,

35:07.920 --> 35:09.880
Iend us your DHD.

35:13.599 --> 35:16.000
You can come with it, if you like.

35:17.119 --> 35:19.199
Please.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.239
Sir, Daniel just called.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.480
The Russians have agreed
to loan us the DHD temporarily.

35:25.599 --> 35:28.480
- Will it make a difference?
- Eventually, it might.

35:28.559 --> 35:32.039
I've been ordered to resume
normal operation by the president.

35:32.159 --> 35:34.880
- Sir...
- SG-2 is prepping for a recon mission

35:35.000 --> 35:36.960
to P4C-796.

35:37.079 --> 35:39.559
- I need more time.
- I've been given an order.

35:39.679 --> 35:43.239
I don't care. You open that gate,
and you are murdering Teal'c.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.000
My only other choice is to resign.

35:46.679 --> 35:51.559
If I resign, I have no control over who will
be running this facility an hour from now.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.840
Is that enough time?

35:56.199 --> 35:57.519
No.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.559
Tell me what else I can do.

36:02.639 --> 36:04.599
I can't, sir.

36:15.559 --> 36:17.519
Dial the gate.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.360
Major, there's a call from Colonel O'Neill.
It's urgent.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.559
Thank you.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.440
Chevron five encoded.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.559
- We have to abort.
- Stand down, Major.

36:51.639 --> 36:54.679
Colonel O'Neill has the information
we need to save Teal'c.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.239
Chevron six encoded.

36:56.360 --> 36:59.920
And he has evidence
that will incriminate Colonel Simmons.

37:00.119 --> 37:02.679
- She's lying.
- Abort the dialling sequence.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.679
- Arrest Colonel Simmons.
- This is preposterous!

37:05.760 --> 37:08.039
Take him away. If he resists, shoot him.

37:17.559 --> 37:22.519
(distorted) You remove the master
control crystal before you attach the DHD.

37:22.639 --> 37:25.079
Otherwise, the imprint will be erased.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.360
That was a joke. He was joking.

37:30.159 --> 37:32.079
- Major?
- Well, theoretically...

37:32.199 --> 37:35.719
Are you insane? He's a Goa'uld.
He wants you to destroy yourself.

37:35.920 --> 37:40.639
If you remove the master control crystal,
nothing regulates the energy distribution.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.760
The whole gate could explode.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.679
- That true?
- Well, technically, it's possible.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.960
The gate's a powerful superconductor.
But we could take steps to ensure...

37:50.039 --> 37:54.480
You are a whack-job. You're no better
if you listen to her. It's a wild guess.

37:54.559 --> 37:58.760
Her judgment is clouded by her personal
feelings. Teal'c is toast. He's history.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.400
Sir, we could make sure
the risk was very small.

38:01.480 --> 38:05.599
You try this, and you blow yourself up
for nothing. No way I'm hangin' around.

38:05.679 --> 38:08.480
Your plane leaves for
Russia in an hour, Doctor.

38:08.599 --> 38:11.000
Russia?

38:11.199 --> 38:16.400
Your new assignment is to supervise
Russia's naqahdah generator programme.

38:16.480 --> 38:20.000
I am not going to Russia.
You know what the food is like in Russia?

38:20.119 --> 38:24.639
- Besides, I'm a civilian. I don't have to.
- While you're on the air force payroll...

38:26.400 --> 38:27.880
Oh, this...

38:31.840 --> 38:33.960
This really sucks.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.719
Major, do what you have to do.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.760
Yes, sir.

38:50.679 --> 38:52.639
OK, Major.

38:53.679 --> 38:58.960
Sir? Master control crystal's removed.
We're ready to connect the DHD.

38:59.079 --> 39:03.440
The place has been evacuated ofall
nonessential personnel. Proceed, Major.

39:03.559 --> 39:04.719
Sir.

39:06.880 --> 39:09.599
Hey, you sure you wanna
be in there for this?

39:09.719 --> 39:11.679
Not really, sir.

39:12.719 --> 39:14.679
Wasn't talkin' to you.

39:16.079 --> 39:20.119
Sir, if the gate blows up,
it won't matter where we are on the base.

39:21.159 --> 39:22.800
Right.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.880
Not too late to change
your mind about leaving.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.159
I will stay.

39:30.079 --> 39:32.039
Do it.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.360
Well, that never happened
in any of the simulations.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.840
Shake it off, Sparky.

40:33.079 --> 40:37.280
- Teal'c, buddy, you all right?
- Indeed.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.960
Teal'c, as far as you know,
what just happened?

40:41.119 --> 40:43.360
I have my revenge.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.760
Tanith is dead.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.320
That's nice. I'm happy for you.

40:51.320 --> 40:54.280
It's good to see you in one piece, Teal'c.

40:54.360 --> 40:57.320
Yes. We thought we lost you again.

40:58.119 --> 41:00.400
Are you sure you're feeling normal?

41:00.519 --> 41:03.639
Yes. What has transpired here?

41:03.800 --> 41:07.159
Well, believe it or not,
you owe your life to a Goa'uld.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.559
Never.

41:09.679 --> 41:11.639
Oh, yes.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.480
