WEBVTT

00:00.893 --> 00:04.861
But you're using
birth control, right?

00:04.929 --> 00:07.030
Yeah, of course.

00:07.099 --> 00:09.633
It's just that Schmidt
gets so athletic

00:09.701 --> 00:11.302
that birth control
becomes like one

00:11.369 --> 00:14.504
of those plastic barbecue
covers in a hurricane.

00:16.006 --> 00:17.607
I didn't want
to know that.

00:17.674 --> 00:18.774
Okay,

00:18.842 --> 00:20.343
the pregnancy test
doesn't work

00:20.411 --> 00:22.312
until after six days,

00:22.379 --> 00:24.214
so just get through
the weekend

00:24.281 --> 00:26.349
and don't tell Schmidt
until you're sure.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.317
Yeah, no, of course not,
of course.

00:28.384 --> 00:31.553
It's just...

00:31.621 --> 00:33.722
I can't stop thinking

00:33.789 --> 00:36.925
about what a Schmidt baby
would be like.

00:36.993 --> 00:41.196
Just, I mean,
I, I don't know.

00:41.264 --> 00:44.698
Would it just want
to nurse 24 hours a day?

00:44.766 --> 00:47.201
Probably.

00:47.269 --> 00:49.303
We could make it, like,
a douche baby jar.

00:49.371 --> 00:51.672
(chuckles)

00:51.740 --> 00:52.706
(gasps)

00:52.774 --> 00:55.209
Oh, my God.

00:55.277 --> 00:56.710
SCHMIDT:
Ladies, ladies,

00:56.778 --> 00:57.512
what is all the
screaming about?

00:57.579 --> 00:59.013
Oh, my... Jess,

00:59.080 --> 01:00.813
have you finally agreed
to be our third?

01:00.881 --> 01:02.249
Because, you know,
we've discussed this.

01:02.316 --> 01:03.550
We have never talked
about that, Schmidt.

01:03.618 --> 01:04.717
What? Schmidt, this
is not the time.

01:04.785 --> 01:06.653
Schmidt, we were
just thinking

01:06.720 --> 01:08.321
about what you might
have been like as a baby.

01:08.389 --> 01:11.258
Oh, I was the bomb
diggity as a baby.

01:11.325 --> 01:12.859
I mean, I was, I was,
like, break-dancing

01:12.926 --> 01:13.926
at eight months old.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.868
But they say that I needed
a magnum size diaper.

01:22.935 --> 01:25.371
- Oh, my God.
- Get out. Seriously?

01:33.412 --> 01:34.412
All right, what's with the suit?

01:34.480 --> 01:35.480
And if you say swing dancing,

01:35.548 --> 01:36.782
I'm gonna slap your face.

01:36.849 --> 01:38.950
Well, my boss is going
to be on TV today...

01:39.018 --> 01:41.720
Michael Strahan's new talk
show <i>On the Strahan Narrow.</i>

01:41.788 --> 01:43.154
- Great show.
- He's got too many DUls

01:43.222 --> 01:45.590
to drive himself, so I guess
I got to take him.

01:45.658 --> 01:46.624
JESS:
Sit in my room, Schmidt.

01:46.693 --> 01:47.659
Cece's resting.

01:47.727 --> 01:50.728
Hey, guys, um, listen up.

01:50.796 --> 01:54.431
Uh, Sarah is going to be here in
a few minutes, so best behavior.

01:54.499 --> 01:56.266
Who's Sarah?
Russell's daughter,

01:56.334 --> 01:57.968
so no F-bombs,
P-bombs.

01:58.036 --> 02:01.538
Actually, no "B" through "S"
bombs, no bombs,

02:01.606 --> 02:03.941
and no bringing home
college girls, Berlusconi.

02:04.009 --> 02:05.108
(chuckles) Hey, that's not fair.

02:05.176 --> 02:06.609
The girl I've been
hanging out with

02:06.677 --> 02:09.145
is totally mature
and interesting.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.279
Please put on some pants.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.381
Everything you say sounds
really creepy

02:12.449 --> 02:14.617
- when you're not wearing pants.
- Your hair looks nice.

02:14.685 --> 02:17.386
BOTH: Ugh.
- Mmm, this coffee is smoldering.

02:17.454 --> 02:18.755
So creepy.

02:18.823 --> 02:19.823
So what's
with the babysitting?

02:19.890 --> 02:21.123
I think he's
actually testing me.

02:21.191 --> 02:22.791
I think he's seeing
if I can be a mom.

02:22.859 --> 02:24.593
- Are you nervous?
- It's nothing I can't handle.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.294
I'm halfway there...
I'm already her teacher,

02:26.362 --> 02:27.662
so...

02:27.731 --> 02:28.831
(phone chirps)
Oh, she's here.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.400
Um, Nick, uh,
put on some pants

02:32.468 --> 02:34.469
or at least
some really high socks.

02:34.537 --> 02:35.904
High socks it is.

02:35.972 --> 02:37.304
Hi, Ms. Day.

02:37.372 --> 02:38.505
Hi, Sarah.

02:38.573 --> 02:39.741
I can be here
in under five minutes

02:39.808 --> 02:41.075
if I need to be.

02:41.143 --> 02:42.643
(sighs)

02:42.711 --> 02:44.445
Honestly I wouldn't
have agreed to this,

02:44.512 --> 02:45.913
except my husband
is out of town,

02:45.981 --> 02:48.149
and you're Sarah's
favorite teacher

02:48.217 --> 02:50.517
and my husband's
favorite teacher.

02:50.585 --> 02:52.120
(chuckles)

02:52.187 --> 02:54.587
Um, hey, um, I hope
this doesn't sound rude,

02:54.655 --> 02:57.791
but, um, you keep saying
"husband"

02:57.859 --> 02:59.760
and I just want to make sure
you and Russell...

02:59.827 --> 03:01.061
you're not still married?

03:01.129 --> 03:03.263
(laughing):
Oh... no, no.

03:03.330 --> 03:05.966
(both laughing)

03:06.033 --> 03:07.533
'Cause I just, like, wanted
to make sure there wasn't

03:07.601 --> 03:08.934
some very important piece
of information

03:09.002 --> 03:10.669
that I totally missed.

03:10.737 --> 03:13.773
No, I mean, but he'll
always be my husband,

03:13.840 --> 03:15.241
if you know what I mean.

03:15.308 --> 03:16.842
Yeah.

03:16.910 --> 03:19.779
Actually, could you explain
what you mean very clearly?

03:19.846 --> 03:21.881
Cece's acting
really weird.

03:21.948 --> 03:23.615
Do you think she's
getting tired of me?

03:23.683 --> 03:27.051
I mean, look, it's been,
like, months of non-stop sex.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.687
I mean, what can I do if she doesn't
let me hit the fifth chakra?

03:29.755 --> 03:32.456
- I'm not listening to you.
- I'm just, I'm just saying, look,

03:32.524 --> 03:34.558
do you think she wants something
more than sex? (phone ringing)

03:34.626 --> 03:36.694
Do you think she's
finally becoming a girl?

03:36.762 --> 03:38.196
'Cause I can't
handle that, man.

03:38.264 --> 03:39.230
Hey, boss.
What are you doing?

03:39.298 --> 03:40.464
- Hmm?
- Look...

03:40.532 --> 03:42.632
W-W-Wait, n-n-no,
yesterday you said noon,

03:42.700 --> 03:44.567
- but it's only 10:30.
- Do you think that I've become too dependent

03:44.635 --> 03:46.303
- on a hot lava massage?
- Hmm?

03:46.370 --> 03:48.638
- I'm gonna be there in just a second.
- What about costumes?

03:48.706 --> 03:50.740
- I got to go, bye.
- Do you think I made her dress up too much?

03:50.809 --> 03:52.009
Look, man, I'm not going
to sit here

03:52.076 --> 03:53.476
and bond with you
about this, all right?

03:53.544 --> 03:56.680
I got to go babysit
my boss.

03:56.747 --> 03:58.314
JESS: <i>Hey, Schmidt,</i> <i>you
gonna stay for dinner?</i>

03:58.381 --> 03:59.682
We're going to borrow
your pasta maker.

03:59.749 --> 04:01.083
Oh, that's great,
are you gonna teach Sarah

04:01.151 --> 04:03.385
your recipe
for overcooked mush?

04:03.453 --> 04:05.154
JESS: Ha, ha, no, I'm
teaching her about Italy.

04:05.222 --> 04:06.289
NICK: I'm coming with a date...

04:06.356 --> 04:07.690
Chloe.
Uh, no, you're not.

04:07.757 --> 04:09.859
You are not bringing
any of those girls around Sarah.

04:09.927 --> 04:10.860
Hey, you must be Sarah.

04:10.928 --> 04:12.328
And you guys
are wrong

04:12.395 --> 04:15.363
about Chloe. Okay, Chloe
is smart and she's mature

04:15.431 --> 04:18.899
and she knows about art
and famous artists like Banksy

04:18.968 --> 04:20.435
and the guy who did
the Obama poster

04:20.502 --> 04:22.070
and, you know, like,
Chalk Outline Guy.

04:23.906 --> 04:25.640
That's stupid.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.976
Your eyes
are so brown.

04:28.044 --> 04:29.576
They look like poop.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.912
Be honest with me...
do my eyes look like poo?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.780
There's a bit of
a, a poopy-ish hue.

04:33.849 --> 04:35.216
Old poo eyes.
(Sarah laughs)

04:35.283 --> 04:37.117
(sighs)

04:42.457 --> 04:43.490
Oh, hey.

04:43.558 --> 04:45.758
I like your house.

04:45.826 --> 04:46.960
It's not my house!

04:47.027 --> 04:47.727
- Go, go!
- What?

04:47.794 --> 04:49.095
(speaking Cambodian)

04:49.163 --> 04:50.730
Go!
(tires screeching)

04:50.797 --> 04:53.199
(yelling in Cambodian)

04:53.267 --> 04:55.168
- What's going on?
- What are you talking about, man?

04:55.236 --> 04:57.937
I'm sweating spicy ban hoaw,
wearing a Cambodian woman's shoes.

04:58.005 --> 05:00.273
What do you think is going on?
I don't know, I'm just trying to give you

05:00.341 --> 05:03.008
an opportunity to lie to me,
Joe, just trying to be polite.

05:03.076 --> 05:05.944
Actually, the ancient Egyptians
made pasta

05:06.012 --> 05:09.214
by flattening the dough
with their feet.

05:09.282 --> 05:10.548
Cool, huh?

05:11.316 --> 05:13.252
Sarah?

05:17.956 --> 05:20.258
Hey.
(chuckles)

05:20.325 --> 05:22.393
Why do you have so many bras?

05:22.460 --> 05:23.727
You're a teacher.

05:23.795 --> 05:25.263
Teachers need
bras, too.

05:25.330 --> 05:28.366
You know, like, all
that erasing and stuff.

05:28.433 --> 05:29.700
It's like...

05:29.768 --> 05:31.835
That's an after-
school bra.

05:32.904 --> 05:34.837
Can I get out
of doing homework

05:34.906 --> 05:36.239
because you're dating
my dad?

05:36.307 --> 05:37.307
No.

05:37.375 --> 05:40.143
Um, hey, I know
having your teacher

05:40.211 --> 05:43.813
dating your dad
is weird, um, but

05:43.881 --> 05:47.650
I just want you to know that,
um, you can ask me anything.

05:48.518 --> 05:49.218
Really?

05:49.286 --> 05:50.986
Yeah, anything.

05:51.054 --> 05:52.388
Are you in love
with my dad?

05:52.455 --> 05:53.923
Hmm... oh...

05:53.990 --> 05:56.458
Do you and my dad
ever dry-lump?

05:56.526 --> 05:58.794
G... uh...

05:58.861 --> 06:01.063
- Is sexting cool?
- What? No, it's not cool.

06:01.131 --> 06:03.165
Have you done a 99?

06:03.233 --> 06:04.866
I think that's a tax form.

06:04.934 --> 06:07.601
Have you ever given
anyone plow jobs?

06:07.669 --> 06:08.836
I don't know.

06:08.904 --> 06:11.239
How do you make love
to a person animal-style?

06:12.307 --> 06:14.309
Do you want to learn
how to play bridge?

06:15.553 --> 06:17.986
SCHMIDT:
<i>I've been doing some thinking, and</i>

06:18.554 --> 06:19.754
I think it's time

06:19.821 --> 06:21.922
that I take you
on a real date.

06:22.490 --> 06:24.224
You're asking me
out on a date?

06:24.292 --> 06:25.359
Yeah, it'll be
our first real date.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.294
Now, Italy on Ice
is a celebration

06:27.362 --> 06:29.229
of all things Italian

06:29.297 --> 06:30.364
featuring
ice dancing's

06:30.431 --> 06:33.100
biggest and brightest
Italian stars.

06:33.168 --> 06:35.268
Drea de Matteo
is scheduled to appear,

06:35.335 --> 06:37.070
but, you know, they're not
liable if she doesn't.

06:37.138 --> 06:38.972
I can't go right now.

06:39.539 --> 06:41.307
It's a really bad time, okay?

06:41.375 --> 06:44.010
I'm sorry,
just take someone else.

06:44.778 --> 06:46.179
You mean, like another girl?

06:46.246 --> 06:49.248
Yeah, Schmidt,
that's what this is.

06:49.316 --> 06:50.749
That's the deal.

06:50.817 --> 06:52.785
Just take someone
else, okay?

06:52.852 --> 06:54.252
All right, yeah, sure,
yeah, I'll just...

06:54.320 --> 06:56.055
I'll ask somebody else,
I'll just... yeah,

06:56.122 --> 06:57.890
totally, and with

06:57.957 --> 07:00.258
these VIP tickets I got...
poppacorno.

07:00.326 --> 07:02.161
- What?
- Poppacorno.

07:02.228 --> 07:03.562
Poppacorno.

07:03.629 --> 07:04.997
It's "popcorn"
in Italian.

07:06.532 --> 07:09.200
I don't think you should be
rushing into these things.

07:09.267 --> 07:11.169
You need to look
for a partner who is...

07:11.236 --> 07:13.504
Ew, you said "partner."

07:13.572 --> 07:14.839
I know, that sucked.

07:14.907 --> 07:16.307
I'm sorry.

07:16.374 --> 07:20.377
Look, as your friend Jess,
not Ms. Day,

07:20.445 --> 07:23.479
just choose someone
who makes you laugh.

07:23.547 --> 07:26.950
- Like Nick?
- Yeah, I mean... wait, what?

07:27.018 --> 07:29.385
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
I love Nick so, so, so much.

07:29.453 --> 07:30.553
He's so hot.

07:30.621 --> 07:31.521
- That Nick?
- I want to rub

07:31.589 --> 07:35.225
my face on his face.

07:35.292 --> 07:37.160
(moans)

07:38.562 --> 07:40.229
Just to be clear,
I am dialing

07:40.296 --> 07:42.464
another woman to go see
Italy on Ice right now.

07:42.532 --> 07:43.398
CECE:
That's fine, do it.

07:43.466 --> 07:44.867
Hey, guys, not now.

07:44.935 --> 07:46.969
- Oh, it's ringing.
- Don't care.

07:47.037 --> 07:49.004
This room cannot take
any more hormones.

07:49.072 --> 07:51.106
I love the juxtaposition
of high-brow literary

07:51.173 --> 07:52.742
with low-brow
youth culture.

07:52.809 --> 07:55.009
It's almost too much
juxtaposition for me.

07:55.077 --> 07:56.144
You know what I mean?

07:56.212 --> 07:58.379
It's, like, right up
to the line of juxtaposition,

07:58.447 --> 08:00.248
but I think I'm gonna let it slide.
(ringtone playing)

08:00.315 --> 08:02.483
Hey, I got to... yes.

08:02.551 --> 08:03.651
You've got Nick.

08:03.719 --> 08:06.420
Hey, Nick-ole.

08:06.488 --> 08:07.922
- What it be, girl?
- What's going on, Schmidt?

08:07.990 --> 08:08.990
What you got
going on, ma?

08:09.058 --> 08:11.324
It's the freakin' weekend.

08:11.392 --> 08:13.660
- Did you just call me "girl"?
- Are you wearing something sexy?

08:13.728 --> 08:16.263
Just, you know, button-down
and jeans like always.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.565
Oh, you got jeans on,
baby, are they tight?

08:18.633 --> 08:19.967
Hmm, they're a little loose;
I buy 'em big.

08:20.034 --> 08:22.335
Oh, them jeans
sound sexy.

08:22.403 --> 08:24.571
Everything all right?
You want to hang out more, Schmidt?

08:24.639 --> 08:26.573
You taking care of that tushy...
taking care of that tushy for me?

08:26.641 --> 08:27.539
I'm not doing, like,

08:27.607 --> 08:29.008
squats or anything.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.209
I'm trying to eat
less doughnuts.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.177
You still
keeping it tight?

08:32.479 --> 08:33.846
You're an idiot.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.048
What?

08:36.116 --> 08:37.515
I thought this is
what you wanted.

08:37.583 --> 08:38.885
JESS: This is a
really good example

08:38.952 --> 08:41.553
of people who should
not be making love.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.453
- Have fun.
- Cece, are you okay?

08:43.522 --> 08:44.790
Damn it!

08:44.857 --> 08:46.291
SARAH: You don't
understand... I love Nick

08:46.358 --> 08:47.725
so, so, so much.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.394
He's so hot,
I'm going to die.

08:49.461 --> 08:51.562
Sarah, Nick is
way too old for you.

08:51.630 --> 08:52.998
I live with him.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.666
- He is dirty and weird.
- No, no, no, no...

08:54.733 --> 08:56.134
Sarah, not Nick's room.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.270
It's not well ventilated
in there.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.104
Let's see, we'll get
there a little early,

09:00.172 --> 09:01.738
maybe get you
in the shower,

09:01.807 --> 09:03.373
maybe a once-over with
some disinfectant.

09:03.441 --> 09:05.009
Hmm... hey.

09:05.076 --> 09:06.543
Yard sale...
pull over.

09:06.611 --> 09:07.577
(chuckles)
No.

09:07.645 --> 09:09.413
Someone rich died,
I can smell it.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.049
Okay, look, Joe, I'm trying to
get you to the show on time.

09:12.117 --> 09:14.285
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
- I'll push you out of the car,

09:14.352 --> 09:15.418
okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:15.485 --> 09:17.787
Oh, yeah, yeah,
baby, yard sale, yeah.

09:17.855 --> 09:19.022
Oh, I feel so alive.

09:19.089 --> 09:20.290
Aah, I got a charley horse.

09:20.357 --> 09:21.191
Oh, God.

09:22.526 --> 09:24.160
Hey, Sarah.

09:24.228 --> 09:25.695
Can you come out of Nick's room?

09:25.762 --> 09:27.530
I'm going to roll
in his dirty clothes.

09:27.597 --> 09:29.933
- Jess, Schmidt asked me out.
- Oh.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.800
Like, he came over
and he asked me out,

09:31.868 --> 09:33.035
and I really can't go

09:33.102 --> 09:34.169
- on a date with him right now.
- Okay...

09:34.237 --> 09:36.038
(Cece and Sarah talking)

09:36.105 --> 09:37.806
Sarah! I've had enough
of this little...

09:37.874 --> 09:39.074
- Shh! - Listen to me, listen to me,

09:39.142 --> 09:40.575
all right,
you little brat,

09:40.643 --> 09:42.477
you just need to be quiet
because I need my friend

09:42.545 --> 09:44.646
to focus on me right now!

09:44.714 --> 09:45.981
(whispering):
What are you doing, Cece?

09:46.049 --> 09:47.448
You know how much
this means to me.

09:47.515 --> 09:48.682
Don't let your
dysfunction

09:48.750 --> 09:50.251
rub off on her.

09:50.319 --> 09:52.086
I am going to be
a terrible mother.

09:52.154 --> 09:53.821
- No, no, no, shh.
- A terrible mom!

09:53.889 --> 09:55.289
I'm gonna be
just like my mother.

09:55.357 --> 09:56.623
You're gonna be
a great mom.

09:56.691 --> 09:57.725
You're gonna be a
fashionable mom.

09:57.792 --> 09:59.660
I can make this right, okay?

09:59.728 --> 10:00.694
Just...

10:00.762 --> 10:03.029
Sarah?

10:03.097 --> 10:04.197
Hey, Sarah.

10:04.265 --> 10:05.732
Um, look,

10:05.799 --> 10:09.469
you should definitely
not be having sex right now

10:09.536 --> 10:11.137
at this age,
but when you do,

10:11.205 --> 10:13.439
just make sure
you always use protection

10:13.507 --> 10:15.208
because,
even if he says it's tantric

10:15.276 --> 10:17.177
and you're Indian

10:17.245 --> 10:18.878
and you know better,

10:18.945 --> 10:20.479
you're just going to end up
pregnant anyways.

10:20.546 --> 10:21.646
SCHMIDT:
What?

10:24.284 --> 10:26.451
Cece, are you pregnant?

10:26.519 --> 10:27.452
SARAH:
Whoa!

10:27.520 --> 10:29.321
Sarah, Nick
has one tie.

10:29.389 --> 10:30.555
See if you
can find it.

10:30.623 --> 10:31.390
CECE:
No, okay,

10:31.457 --> 10:33.058
I don't know.

10:33.126 --> 10:35.026
We have to wait for the
test results, but I'm late.

10:37.029 --> 10:38.496
Oh, my...

10:38.563 --> 10:40.798
We made
a caramel miracle.

10:40.866 --> 10:45.036
(laughing):
You pregnant, you pregnant.

10:45.104 --> 10:46.938
Oh, my God.

10:48.251 --> 10:49.398
You got Cece pregnant?

10:49.401 --> 10:51.402
We used protection.
I don't know how this happened.

10:51.470 --> 10:53.471
- Think she did it on purpose?
- An Indian-Jewish baby...

10:53.539 --> 10:55.306
who wouldn't want that? Think
about the bone structure.

10:55.374 --> 10:56.640
Okay, I'm not ready to be
a godparent.

10:56.708 --> 10:57.908
Don't ask.

10:57.976 --> 10:59.609
- No one's asking you.
- Phew, good.

10:59.677 --> 11:01.878
- I'm not into being an uncle.
- You're not my brother!

11:01.946 --> 11:03.880
Okay, Schmidt, are you sure
you're okay about this?

11:03.948 --> 11:05.382
'Cause I'm freaking out
by the fact

11:05.450 --> 11:06.916
that you're <i>not</i> freaking out!

11:06.984 --> 11:08.952
Yeah, I'm oddly calm
about the whole thing.

11:09.019 --> 11:12.589
Look, Nick, maybe this isn't
exactly in my five-year plan,

11:12.656 --> 11:14.291
but maybe this is fate.

11:14.358 --> 11:16.125
You know, maybe I
hit the jackpot.

11:16.193 --> 11:17.926
Maybe this is the
universe telling me

11:17.994 --> 11:20.296
that I'm never gonna find
a girl better than Cece.

11:20.363 --> 11:22.164
By, the way, I'm-I'm Schmidt.

11:22.232 --> 11:24.400
Chloe. Mazel tov on your news.

11:24.468 --> 11:26.268
Oh, my God, finally, Nicholas.

11:26.336 --> 11:28.637
- You bring home a nice girl.
- Right?

11:36.077 --> 11:37.745
So... that was crazy

11:37.813 --> 11:39.481
what happened
with my friends, right?

11:39.548 --> 11:41.249
I liked it.

11:41.317 --> 11:42.750
Your life's like
<i>Gossip Girl,</i>

11:42.818 --> 11:44.419
only everyone is
old and poor.

11:44.487 --> 11:46.821
You know, there actually
was a show like that.

11:46.888 --> 11:48.622
It was called <i>Golden Girls.</i>

11:48.689 --> 11:52.493
I'm Betty White,
Schmidt's Rue McClanahan...

11:52.560 --> 11:53.927
Don't <i>you</i> think Nick is hot?

11:53.995 --> 11:57.430
Nick? Um... yeah,

11:57.498 --> 12:01.868
in a rumpled, small-town
P.I. kind of way.

12:01.936 --> 12:03.202
What's he like in the morning?

12:03.270 --> 12:04.738
Do his eyes
get sleepy?

12:04.805 --> 12:06.106
Does he love stuff?

12:06.173 --> 12:08.441
I want to love what he loves.

12:08.509 --> 12:10.776
Do you think that we'll ever
do animal style?

12:10.844 --> 12:12.745
Four minutes!
We eat in four!

12:12.812 --> 12:15.480
I made you a mocktail.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.283
Cece, are you crying?

12:18.351 --> 12:20.019
No. No. (sniffles)

12:20.086 --> 12:22.287
No. I-I... I just...
I don't... I don't know.

12:22.355 --> 12:24.823
You're an amazing woman,

12:24.891 --> 12:29.193
and you're going to do and be
so many things in this life.

12:29.961 --> 12:31.062
Maybe you'll
be a mom,

12:31.130 --> 12:34.632
and maybe... maybe not.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.969
But I will support
you no matter what.

12:42.105 --> 12:43.040
Thank you.

12:43.107 --> 12:45.909
I also just want to give
you a quick heads up.

12:46.477 --> 12:48.311
I'm probably going to
be going on the internet

12:48.379 --> 12:50.147
before we have
sex again, because

12:50.214 --> 12:52.549
I-I just... I don't want to
impregnate the baby, you know?

12:52.616 --> 12:54.517
I mean, we could have

12:54.585 --> 12:57.187
a Russian nesting doll
situation on our hands.

13:02.759 --> 13:04.526
(loud munching,
fork scrapes plate)

13:04.594 --> 13:06.195
So, Sarah and I learned

13:06.262 --> 13:08.764
to use the pasta maker
today, which was cool.

13:08.832 --> 13:10.365
Are you and Nick making love?

13:10.433 --> 13:11.266
Hmm?

13:11.268 --> 13:13.135
Who wants seconds?
That's my question.

13:13.203 --> 13:15.003
Yeah, I would love seconds,
Jess. That'd be great.

13:15.071 --> 13:16.604
If you're a boy, I'm gonna...

13:16.672 --> 13:19.674
I'm gonna name you Mordecai,
or Abraham,

13:19.742 --> 13:23.377
Menachem Menandel,
Schmerson.

13:23.445 --> 13:27.548
Hey! I'm watching you.

13:27.616 --> 13:29.217
Well, time for dessert.

13:29.284 --> 13:31.418
No, please don't get up.
I will take care of it.

13:31.485 --> 13:33.620
Oh, thank you.
That's so thoughtful.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.555
See? Thoughtful and mature.

13:35.623 --> 13:37.858
In your face! Yes!

13:37.926 --> 13:41.128
Congratulations. You're dating
a girl with basic table manners.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.964
You win. Why don't you get
on her health care plan?

13:44.032 --> 13:45.865
(blowing raspberries)

13:45.933 --> 13:46.799
SCHMIDT:
I'm so excited

13:46.867 --> 13:49.135
to take this journey with you.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.071
I mean, your boobs are gonna be
unbelievably enormous.

13:52.139 --> 13:53.940
JESS:
Sarah,

13:54.007 --> 13:56.408
do you want to go help Chloe
with the dessert? I hate her.

13:56.476 --> 13:57.844
Oh, come on,
you don't hate her.

13:57.911 --> 13:59.411
You don't know her
well enough to hate her.

13:59.479 --> 14:00.813
Yes, I do!
I know her.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.280
She used to ride
on my school bus.

14:02.348 --> 14:02.848
No, no, no, that's...

14:02.915 --> 14:04.149
What?

14:04.217 --> 14:06.618
Oh, my God, that's

14:06.685 --> 14:07.853
why you look
so familiar!

14:07.920 --> 14:09.287
You were that crazy

14:09.355 --> 14:10.722
little kindergartner
who had, like,

14:10.790 --> 14:12.323
- the imaginary friends.
- Oh.

14:12.391 --> 14:13.859
You're the skank
with the skank face.

14:13.926 --> 14:16.161
Sarah, I know you're trying
to look cool in front of you

14:16.229 --> 14:16.995
you know who...

14:17.063 --> 14:18.295
What?! You told him?!

14:18.363 --> 14:20.197
- No! I did not tell him.
- You just told him!

14:20.265 --> 14:22.233
Oh, my God, Jess!

14:22.300 --> 14:24.101
(door slams, Jess sighs)

14:24.169 --> 14:25.569
What are you saying?

14:25.637 --> 14:27.304
When was the last time
you were on a school bus?

14:27.872 --> 14:28.672
Last year.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.607
How old are you?

14:30.675 --> 14:33.277
18.
(groaning)

14:33.344 --> 14:34.811
JESS:
Hey, you know what, Chloe?

14:34.879 --> 14:36.079
I actually think I subbed

14:36.147 --> 14:37.346
for your eighth grade
English class.

14:37.414 --> 14:39.548
That's right!
Hi, Miss Day!

14:39.616 --> 14:40.784
Hi.
(Nick groans)

14:44.188 --> 14:46.389
Well, it's a good thing I got
you an extra shirt, 'cause...

14:46.456 --> 14:48.291
(grunts)
Whoa! Joe, Joe!

14:48.358 --> 14:49.958
Where you going?
Where you going? Wait.

14:50.026 --> 14:52.094
Where are you going?
Uh, sorry about this, man.

14:52.162 --> 14:54.930
Hey, don't make me chase you!
Do not make me chase you!

14:54.998 --> 14:56.999
Joe, come back.
(coughs)

14:57.066 --> 14:59.434
(thudding)
(grunts)

14:59.502 --> 15:01.303
Oh!
Are you okay?

15:01.370 --> 15:03.772
Leave me alone.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.307
So, come on,
man. What's up?

15:06.374 --> 15:08.609
Michael Strahan makes me feel
like an idiot.

15:08.677 --> 15:12.814
Okay? I mean, he thinks
he's better than me.

15:12.881 --> 15:14.048
He wins the Super Bowl,
and suddenly,

15:14.116 --> 15:15.516
he's the best at everything.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.451
What's he better
than you at? Huh?

15:17.519 --> 15:20.087
Marriage, probably. Money
management, I would say.

15:20.155 --> 15:21.988
- Probably he's better than you at that.
- Well...

15:22.056 --> 15:22.923
He's not better than
you at yard sales.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.157
He's good at yard sales.

15:24.225 --> 15:25.391
Yeah, but he's not
better than you.

15:25.459 --> 15:26.561
So here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna walk

15:26.629 --> 15:27.829
into that studio,
and you're gonna

15:27.896 --> 15:29.297
show him the Napoli
that I saw today.

15:29.465 --> 15:31.433
The one that I saw
grabbed seven copies

15:31.500 --> 15:34.234
of <i>Speed</i> on VHS
at a yard sale

15:34.302 --> 15:36.402
for a fraction of
the retail price.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.871
When's the last time
Strahan did that?

15:38.939 --> 15:40.440
Boom. You're not gonna let him win.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.040
Yeah. You know, I'm gonna do it.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.374
- I'm gonna do it.
- You're gonna do it?

15:43.375 --> 15:44.943
That guy's a b-hole.
He's a b-hole!

15:45.010 --> 15:46.778
You know what?
If you were a woman,

15:46.847 --> 15:49.949
or even dressed as a woman,
man, we'd be unstoppable.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.817
Mm, mm.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.819
18 years old. She
was 18 years old.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.087
She doesn't even know
what Netscape is.

15:56.155 --> 15:59.224
Thinks of Ice Cube
as mainly an actor.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.692
This is a disaster!
Ouli's downstairs.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.527
She just called me.
She wants to be let up.

16:03.595 --> 16:05.330
Sarah's in my room, because
she fell in love with you

16:05.397 --> 16:06.931
for some unknown reason.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.867
I might as well call you
<i>Bridge to Terabithia,</i>

16:08.934 --> 16:10.400
because you make children cry.

16:10.468 --> 16:12.802
And you... I might
as well call you

16:12.871 --> 16:14.271
<i>Indian In the Cupboard</i> because

16:14.339 --> 16:15.939
you put an Indian
in Ce... Never mind.

16:16.007 --> 16:18.375
I will not apologize
for my powerful sperm.

16:18.442 --> 16:20.077
Why are young girls in love
with me? I look like an old man.

16:20.144 --> 16:21.478
Shut up, both of you!

16:21.545 --> 16:22.579
We're gonna fix
this, 'cause

16:22.646 --> 16:24.281
I'm not losing Russell because

16:24.349 --> 16:27.816
you two have to make
and/or date babies.

16:27.885 --> 16:29.418
You... go stall Ouli.

16:29.486 --> 16:31.020
Try not to get her pregnant.

16:31.088 --> 16:32.421
You... come with me

16:32.489 --> 16:34.924
and get Sarah out
of my room. Now!

16:35.992 --> 16:36.792
I gonna go do Ouli.

16:36.860 --> 16:38.694
- Yeah, I'm gonna go do this.
- Yeah. All right.

16:42.798 --> 16:44.232
- Ouli?
- Yeah.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.167
Oh, my God, it's-it's Schmidt.

16:46.235 --> 16:47.735
How are you?

16:47.803 --> 16:49.971
Oh, my God,
it's so good to see you.

16:50.039 --> 16:51.773
Great.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.375
Yeah. Havasu.

16:53.442 --> 16:55.743
'99. I was on the boat,
remember?

16:55.811 --> 16:57.379
No.

16:57.446 --> 16:58.745
We were just... We were part...
Yeah. I...

16:58.813 --> 17:00.814
- Winter Olympics. Uh-huh.
- No.

17:00.882 --> 17:02.416
2006.

17:02.483 --> 17:04.117
Bobsled.

17:04.185 --> 17:05.852
Sarah, I know that you think

17:05.921 --> 17:07.721
you're in love with me
right now,

17:07.789 --> 17:10.624
but I promise you, you're going
to find someone better.

17:10.691 --> 17:13.294
SARAH:
No! No, I never will.

17:13.361 --> 17:15.028
I can be a bit of an anchor.

17:15.095 --> 17:16.529
I've been known
to drag women down.

17:16.596 --> 17:17.997
That is true.
(whispers): Save me.

17:18.065 --> 17:19.432
What? This is so
entertaining.

17:19.499 --> 17:20.800
Okay, Jess, honestly, help me.

17:20.867 --> 17:22.068
I don't know what to do.
All right.

17:22.136 --> 17:24.337
Okay, just tell
her something about

17:24.405 --> 17:26.204
life or something.

17:26.272 --> 17:27.873
Hey, Sarah?

17:28.442 --> 17:30.608
Sarah, I haven't loved somebody
the way you love me

17:30.676 --> 17:35.847
in a very long time,
and I miss that feeling.

17:35.915 --> 17:38.883
The feeling you have is good.
It's just misplaced.

17:39.952 --> 17:42.421
It's better than being numb
your whole life.

17:42.488 --> 17:43.922
You end up doing such
weird things.

17:43.990 --> 17:46.390
You know what?
Just stay in there.

17:46.458 --> 17:47.891
It's not that great out here.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.260
Stay in there as long
as you can.

17:49.328 --> 17:50.761
He's kidding, Sarah.

17:50.829 --> 17:52.696
You should definitely,
definitely come out.

17:52.764 --> 17:54.798
Oh, my God.
The Melman funeral?

17:54.866 --> 17:57.234
- No. - We were both
sitting next to...

17:57.302 --> 17:59.337
to Un... Un-Uncle Jack?

17:59.404 --> 18:01.272
- Yeah, sure.
- I don't know Uncle Jack or Mel...

18:01.340 --> 18:05.475
Oh, my... I used to do
your hair in Tribeca.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.511
- Sarah? Sarah, please come out.
- Sarah, please.

18:08.579 --> 18:10.813
I can't come out.
I'm too embarrassed.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.482
In front of us?
We are literally

18:12.549 --> 18:14.817
the most embarrassing
people on the planet.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.187
- Trust me. - Yeah, you don't have
to be embarrassed around us.

18:17.254 --> 18:19.321
Sometimes I talk louder
to blind people.

18:19.389 --> 18:22.858
I'm 30 years old, and I've peed
in every pool I've been into.

18:22.925 --> 18:25.694
- Every single one.
- Ew.

18:25.761 --> 18:29.164
I originally grew these bangs
'cause I hate my forehead.

18:29.232 --> 18:31.633
I still think it's funny
when I guy puts tennis balls

18:31.701 --> 18:33.202
under his shirt
and pretends it's boobs.

18:33.269 --> 18:34.602
(muffled laugh)

18:34.669 --> 18:35.903
They look like
little boobs.

18:35.971 --> 18:37.438
I know.

18:37.506 --> 18:39.173
Come on, Sarah!

18:39.241 --> 18:42.110
Look, I do so many
stupid things.

18:42.177 --> 18:43.644
You don't even know.

18:43.712 --> 18:45.513
I mean, like, falling
for your dad.

18:45.580 --> 18:50.117
That was... so crazy, and I
understand why you're confused.

18:50.184 --> 18:51.918
<i>I'm</i> confused.

18:51.986 --> 18:54.554
SARAH:
I'm not confused. I'm stuck.

18:54.622 --> 18:57.124
What? Oh, my God.

18:57.191 --> 18:58.625
Oh. I don't know how
to get them off.

18:58.692 --> 19:00.027
Okay. Oh, okay.
I'll get the front.

19:00.094 --> 19:02.496
I'll get the back.

19:02.563 --> 19:03.963
Hey, hey, guys,
she's coming.

19:04.032 --> 19:04.931
Ouli's coming.
I failed.

19:04.999 --> 19:06.098
I failed. I'm sorry. Uh...

19:06.166 --> 19:07.866
Hi, Ouli. Um...

19:07.934 --> 19:11.504
Who is theanan taking the bras
off my daughter?

19:11.571 --> 19:14.106
There is a God!
I've got my period!

19:14.174 --> 19:16.142
It's so amazing!
Oh, my God.

19:16.209 --> 19:18.777
Mmm. I got my period.

19:18.845 --> 19:19.945
(Cece laughs)

19:20.013 --> 19:22.313
- She got her period.
- So happy!

19:22.381 --> 19:24.081
Welcome to our home.
Would you like a drink?

19:25.816 --> 19:29.785
You have a beautiful daughter
and a beautiful ex-husband.

19:29.953 --> 19:32.187
I mean...

19:34.155 --> 19:35.190
Bye, Nick.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.825
I'm kind of
over you now.

19:36.892 --> 19:38.426
Okay.
(Sarah sighs)

19:39.462 --> 19:42.030
- Thank you. - Thanks, Jess.
I had a really great time.

19:42.098 --> 19:45.133
Thanks, Sarah. Good-bye.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.001
(whispering): Your mom doesn't
have to know everything.

19:47.069 --> 19:50.104
- Heard that. Let's go.
- Okay.

19:50.171 --> 19:51.839
- Thanks for coming by.
- Oh, sure.

19:52.406 --> 19:54.675
- Bye, Sarah. See you at school.
- Bye.

19:54.743 --> 19:56.076
Bye, Ouli. You ruley.

19:56.144 --> 19:58.011
Bye, Jess. You're a mess.

20:01.449 --> 20:04.483
I'm not having kids...
till I'm 80.

20:06.620 --> 20:09.321
Now we can just go back
to the way things were.

20:13.325 --> 20:14.493
You can go on your date.

20:16.061 --> 20:20.064
Right. Nicole, mm-hmm.

20:21.499 --> 20:23.334
No more stupid mistakes, right?

20:24.402 --> 20:26.036
Right.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.738
(laughs)

20:27.806 --> 20:29.140
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go.

20:29.208 --> 20:31.176
- Go do your thing.
- Yeah.

20:31.243 --> 20:32.777
Oh, wait. Oh, okay.

20:32.844 --> 20:33.945
- Okay, Cece, let's just...
- Yeah.

20:34.012 --> 20:35.213
You know,
there's a marathon downtown,

20:35.281 --> 20:37.314
- and I don't want you to
hit the traffic. - Okay.

20:37.382 --> 20:38.982
- Okay. Thank you.
- So let's just, head down.

20:39.050 --> 20:40.784
- That's very thought of you.
- Don't hit the top.

20:40.851 --> 20:42.953
Okay. All right, you in, you in, you in?
Good, okay.

20:43.020 --> 20:45.722
Terrible car for a baby anyway.

20:45.790 --> 20:48.325
(sighs)

20:54.565 --> 20:57.699
(sighs)
Oh.

21:01.905 --> 21:04.574
I never knew Italy was so much
more than pizza, Schmidty.

21:04.641 --> 21:06.109
It's so much more.

21:06.176 --> 21:09.078
She's okay. You're awesome!

21:09.145 --> 21:12.013
The reenactment of Pompeii
really stays with you.

21:12.081 --> 21:13.516
What a move!

21:13.783 --> 21:16.418
Two shows a day. Two shows
a day! How do they do it?

21:16.586 --> 21:18.220
Hey, if you're play a gondolier,

21:18.287 --> 21:20.322
you better <i>skate</i>
like a gondolier.

21:20.389 --> 21:22.958
You know, Schmidty?
Here's this idea.

21:23.026 --> 21:25.326
We should buy skaters.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.329
Yeah!
(cheering)

21:28.396 --> 21:30.565
Do something weird, Mussolini.
We love you.
