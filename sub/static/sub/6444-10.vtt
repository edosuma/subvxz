00:26.310 --> 00:30.895
<i>And now, the next senator
of the state of Kansas...</i>

00:30.980 --> 00:33.040
<i>Mr. Jonathan Kent.</i>

00:39.950 --> 00:41.465
Thank you.

00:49.710 --> 00:51.225
Thank you, really.
Thank you.

00:51.710 --> 00:54.619
Thank you all very much
for coming out here this evening.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.164
I'm sure that many of you had
more important things to do tonight...

00:58.300 --> 00:59.896
than listen to some farmer...

01:00.010 --> 01:02.414
talk about the importance
of corn subsidies.

01:05.220 --> 01:10.149
When I told my family that I had indeed
decided to run against Lex Luthor...

01:10.270 --> 01:12.462
they were surprised, to say the least.

01:12.850 --> 01:18.203
I don't think they really understood
why I want to run.

01:18.490 --> 01:20.924
Or why this is
so very important to me.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.906
<i>But the truth is actually...
It's actually very simple.</i>

01:26.330 --> 01:32.390
The courage to help all Kansans, whether
they're rich or whether they're poor.

01:32.870 --> 01:38.819
And do my very best to put the heart
back in the Heartland.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.447
Thank you.

03:11.430 --> 03:14.551
<i>Mr. Luthor,
this is your itinerary for tomorrow.</i>

03:14.640 --> 03:17.549
Push the mayor lunch
and get me a photo op at the hospital.

03:17.650 --> 03:21.730
- Yes, sir.
- The nurses' union is key in the 49th.

03:21.820 --> 03:25.274
One more thing. I need the new
poll numbers from last night.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.128
Yes, sir.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.513
Central Kansas Students
for Lex Luthor, sir.

03:29.620 --> 03:33.620
You have 5 minutes tops.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.999
Thucydides said, "We are either kings
among men or the pawns of kings."

03:50.140 --> 03:53.594
The fact that you're here demonstrates
that you strive for the former.

03:54.980 --> 03:58.010
The youth vote is stronger
than we ever expected...

03:58.520 --> 04:00.288
and I have you to thank for that.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.395
But we cannot afford to be complacent.

04:05.820 --> 04:10.365
Great leaders are forged from those
who see beyond the boundaries...

04:10.870 --> 04:12.890
who go beyond the extra mile.

04:13.910 --> 04:15.970
They go the extra 10.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.938
Defeat is not an option.

04:26.510 --> 04:30.045
Samantha Drake,
president of Students for Lex Luthor.

04:30.180 --> 04:33.927
Well, then I should thank you personally
for my spike in the MTV vote.

04:38.180 --> 04:40.291
It's such an honor to finally meet you.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.965
I know it is kind of geeky,
but I'd be so psyched...

04:43.060 --> 04:44.918
if I could get a picture with you.

04:45.980 --> 04:48.929
Well, anything I can do
to keep up morale with the troops.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.847
Excuse me. Thank you.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.528
Could you get the painting
in the background?

04:58.620 --> 05:02.620
That's what your father gave you after
you closed the Metrotech deal, isn't it?

05:04.040 --> 05:06.737
Well, looks like you've done
your homework, Miss Drake.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.699
Thank you very much.

05:18.770 --> 05:20.709
Used to wear a cross.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.600
Sir, the limo is waiting.

05:28.150 --> 05:30.554
Thank you very much.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.273
- This is Lex.
<i>- You wanted a grenade to throw...</i>

05:43.330 --> 05:45.562
<i>In the Kent camp.
I got an atomic bomb.</i>

05:45.660 --> 05:47.215
This isn't a secure line.

05:47.370 --> 05:49.521
Just meet me
at Rampart and Broadway.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.989
Atomic warfare?

05:59.130 --> 06:01.746
A little overdramatic
for local politics, isn't it?

06:04.100 --> 06:07.383
I got no problems
ending this conversation right now.

06:09.350 --> 06:15.582
I believe in the political weapons trade...

06:15.690 --> 06:17.963
the deal usually goes
to the highest bidder.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.135
Thank you.

06:58.270 --> 06:59.836
Is this for real?

07:02.900 --> 07:05.223
Sosnik had it all trucked up
from Metropolis.

07:06.200 --> 07:10.331
I keep expecting some mobster
with a carnation to step out and plug me.

07:15.290 --> 07:17.815
I have to admit, it's not exactly us.

07:19.170 --> 07:21.109
You sure this guy
knows what he's doing?

07:21.210 --> 07:23.502
Clark, Sosnik helped Jack
win five elections.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.721
I'm sure he knows more about this stuff
than we do.

07:27.220 --> 07:29.533
I think he's trying
to turn you into a Luthor.

07:31.390 --> 07:32.572
Is there a problem?

07:33.560 --> 07:36.630
I was just wondering
if you've ever actually met the Kents.

07:36.770 --> 07:40.184
You see someone is gonna vote
for Mr. Kent because they relate to him.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.138
And who is gonna believe
that he supports local farmers...

07:43.240 --> 07:46.603
when he looks like some business
blowhard... No offense, Mr. Kent.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.084
Who wants to buy them out?

07:48.200 --> 07:52.240
Yeah, well, that's called
bridging the demo gap, dear.

07:52.370 --> 07:55.319
Does bridging the gap also include
misquoting the candidate?

07:55.460 --> 07:58.702
Wait a minute. It says,
"Jonathan Kent is quoted as saying:

07:58.790 --> 08:02.628
'It's possible to serve corporate interests
and maintain the public welfare.'"

08:02.710 --> 08:04.609
- I never said that.
- I did.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.820
- You did?
- Yes.

08:06.970 --> 08:10.717
Look, this whole John-boy thing...
Don't get me wrong, you're good at it.

08:10.810 --> 08:13.204
You may win the cowpokes,
but there's a pool of voters...

08:13.310 --> 08:17.350
that are more familiar with lattes
than they are with digging post holes.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.581
What I really need here is somebody...

08:19.690 --> 08:23.528
who cares about what I believe in
more than they care about winning.

08:25.030 --> 08:27.474
I'm sorry, but you gotta go, Sosnik.
You're fired.

08:32.490 --> 08:34.601
- Pack it up, guys.
- I'll go ahead.

08:34.950 --> 08:37.101
Not that that didn't totally rock,
Mr. Kent.

08:37.210 --> 08:39.907
But I have no idea how you're gonna
find a replacement.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.395
I do.

08:46.590 --> 08:47.853
Oh, me?

08:49.220 --> 08:51.533
What do I know about being
a campaign manager?

08:51.680 --> 08:53.953
What do I know
about being a state senator?

08:55.270 --> 08:56.654
Right.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.368
I'll get it.

09:05.690 --> 09:07.417
Jonathan Kent.

09:07.530 --> 09:10.984
<i>This is your last warning
to drop out of the campaign.</i>

09:11.070 --> 09:13.605
I told you not to call here again.

09:49.610 --> 09:51.893
Hey, what are you doing?

09:51.990 --> 09:55.778
Sorry, but CKU regulations dictate
that all campaign materials...

09:55.870 --> 09:59.112
can be no larger than 20-by-24.

09:59.250 --> 10:03.421
Okay, I think you're taking this
campus gestapo thing way too seriously.

10:03.540 --> 10:06.621
The state's future depends on it,
Ms. Lane.

10:07.090 --> 10:08.474
How do you know my name?

10:08.630 --> 10:11.408
- Lex says, "Always know your enemy."
- Leave it to Lex...

10:11.510 --> 10:14.075
to treat this election like
a hostile takeover...

10:14.180 --> 10:16.998
which is what he's gonna do
to the entire state.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.291
Progress requires sacrifices.

10:19.430 --> 10:23.440
Mr. Kent is neck and neck with
your fascist environmental annihilator.

10:32.320 --> 10:36.027
You heard what Lex said:
"True leaders see beyond boundaries."

10:36.120 --> 10:39.190
He set the bar.
Now we need to raise it higher.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.987
Defeat is not an option.

11:00.770 --> 11:02.285
Coming.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.960
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.154
It looks like someone's
had a long day of campaigning.

11:19.580 --> 11:21.469
More like a long day of Lois.

11:21.620 --> 11:25.246
Well, as much as I'd like to make a fool
of myself at the ice rink...

11:25.380 --> 11:28.450
we could always stay in tonight.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.275
Okay.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.580
What happened? Did I hurt you?

11:43.690 --> 11:47.346
Unless you're the one who assigned
six diagrams on planetary rotation.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.603
On second thought,
maybe we should go.

12:08.750 --> 12:11.528
Okay, this couldn't be more awkward.

12:12.420 --> 12:16.844
But we haven't been together
since I came to Met U.

12:18.050 --> 12:24.958
- You mean we haven't had...
- Sex.

12:26.060 --> 12:28.797
Clark, you can't tell me
that you haven't noticed.

12:31.610 --> 12:33.670
Things between us
haven't been the same...

12:33.780 --> 12:37.739
since you miraculously
came back from the dead.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.547
I know. I...

12:39.660 --> 12:44.205
Lana, I can't explain that anymore.
It changed me.

12:46.620 --> 12:50.579
Maybe I'll never understand
what you went through...

12:50.670 --> 12:53.023
but you're still the same person,
aren't you?

12:55.010 --> 12:58.464
Clark, I don't know. It's just...

12:58.890 --> 13:02.132
Feels like you're afraid
to touch me anymore.

13:06.270 --> 13:07.906
Did something happen?

13:08.770 --> 13:10.538
Clark?

13:11.480 --> 13:13.712
Okay, is this where
I have to remind you...

13:13.820 --> 13:17.436
that you said we wouldn't
keep things from each other anymore?

13:22.280 --> 13:24.058
Why is this about me?

13:25.660 --> 13:27.175
You pulled away first.

13:27.290 --> 13:30.573
You moved to Metropolis
two weeks after we got together.

13:30.830 --> 13:34.082
And now you spend every moment
with these books.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.826
- Why astronomy?
- It's homework.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.778
It's an obsession.

13:39.380 --> 13:42.077
And that thing about honesty,
it works both ways.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.660
Nice deflection.

13:50.190 --> 13:52.079
But I don't fall for that anymore.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.794
I'm gonna go get some air.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.297
Now, just who in the hell are you?

14:42.570 --> 14:45.267
Are you the one
that's been calling me?

14:46.030 --> 14:47.969
Hey!

14:48.120 --> 14:51.655
Are you the guy that's been calling me?
Stay away from me and my family.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.237
It's obviously true what they say.

15:39.340 --> 15:42.370
"Behind every great man,
is a great woman."

15:43.380 --> 15:46.036
The campaign must be taking up
a lot of your time.

15:46.180 --> 15:50.099
Yes, it is. But, fortunately,
Jonathan and I have a lot of help.

15:52.390 --> 15:55.632
Unfortunately, not enough to win.

15:56.650 --> 16:00.306
You know, Lex is entering
the last stretch of the campaign...

16:00.400 --> 16:03.056
with infinite resources.

16:03.190 --> 16:08.291
And I believe you are down, financially,
to nothing.

16:09.530 --> 16:12.439
I'm glad to see you're finally
behind your son.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.143
I thought you knew me better
than that, Lionel.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.603
I would never give up on my husband.

16:18.380 --> 16:20.228
You misunderstand me.

16:22.210 --> 16:24.573
Lex has deep pockets...

16:24.670 --> 16:30.700
and Jonathan needs at least
the money to match that.

16:32.350 --> 16:34.956
This is more than money to match.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.466
We've run this campaign
on his beliefs...

16:45.570 --> 16:48.307
and that's what's gonna win him
the election.

16:48.410 --> 16:50.087
Jonathan would never accept this.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.816
I know. I fully expected Jonathan...

16:52.910 --> 16:57.546
to barrel his way through
the campaign fueled by blind idealism...

16:57.870 --> 17:00.486
but I was hoping
you'd be more savvy.

17:03.170 --> 17:05.362
Perhaps you have your own personal
reasons...

17:05.460 --> 17:09.378
for wanting Jonathan not to win.

17:23.770 --> 17:27.315
I know you didn't come by this late
just to drop off this press release.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.794
What happened?

17:28.900 --> 17:32.405
Well, how far do you wanna cross
this friendship boundary?

17:32.910 --> 17:34.637
Since when did we have boundaries?

17:38.080 --> 17:41.161
All right. Why don't you just
leave out the details.

17:42.790 --> 17:47.719
Well, everything was fine
between Lana and I, when I was human.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.860
I mean, it was great.

17:50.590 --> 17:52.368
Okay. Clark?

17:52.760 --> 17:58.366
But now that I have my abilities back,
it's like our sex life...

17:58.730 --> 18:00.326
has been on hiatus.

18:06.730 --> 18:12.255
I know I'm going to regret
asking this question, but why?

18:14.490 --> 18:20.722
Because it just takes some time for me
to adjust my abilities to new situations.

18:23.790 --> 18:25.689
Awkward factor eight.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.790
So basically, what you're saying
is that...

18:30.880 --> 18:34.587
you're afraid that in the heat
of the moment you might...

18:36.470 --> 18:39.419
Please don't make me finish
this sentence, Clark.

18:40.640 --> 18:45.700
Well, you see, that's the thing.
I'm not sure what would happen.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.673
- If I couldn't control myself...
- You know what?

18:48.780 --> 18:51.265
That's something
that can never be unseen.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.976
- It's not funny.
- No, you're right, it's not.

18:54.070 --> 18:57.989
It's just that this conversation definitely
cements me as your krypto-hag.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.353
Look, Clark...

19:00.910 --> 19:03.778
You can shake my hand
without crushing it, right?

19:03.870 --> 19:07.496
And you don't incinerate everyone
you look at with your heat-vision thing.

19:07.630 --> 19:10.700
So it's pretty much
the same thing, right?

19:10.840 --> 19:13.708
I mean, metaphorically.

19:15.640 --> 19:18.791
But you didn't need me
to tell you all this. So, what gives?

19:23.560 --> 19:26.681
I think I got used to lying to Lana
when we were friends.

19:26.770 --> 19:30.224
- Now it's different.
- Yeah.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.178
You know, Clark, I mean,
I'm playing my best on defense...

19:33.280 --> 19:35.936
but I think you're in denial
about what Lana knows.

19:36.070 --> 19:39.110
I mean, she's studying astronomy.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.331
The meteors, the fact that
the undead topic comes up daily.

19:43.410 --> 19:46.107
- I can't just tell her. It's too risky.
- Okay, fine.

19:46.250 --> 19:49.492
Don't tell her. Your game has
to switch from defense to offense...

19:49.590 --> 19:52.792
because sooner or later, Lana will ask
all the wrong people...

19:52.880 --> 19:54.355
all the right questions.

20:06.900 --> 20:10.304
You didn't say much on the ride home.
Are you sure everything's okay?

20:10.400 --> 20:14.319
Yeah, I'm fine. I'll just be glad
when the election is over.

20:28.460 --> 20:31.116
Shelby, hi.

20:31.210 --> 20:33.533
What's the matter?

20:35.760 --> 20:37.780
What's wrong?

21:00.030 --> 21:03.828
I moved the rally to next week
so Mr. Kent can recover.

21:04.750 --> 21:07.437
- Or not.
- Dad, what are you doing?

21:07.540 --> 21:09.015
I can't let them stop me.

21:13.050 --> 21:16.373
I will tell them the rally's a go again.

21:19.430 --> 21:22.420
I thought the doctor said
he was going to keep you overnight.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.206
No, then they'd have
exactly what they want.

21:25.350 --> 21:28.723
It's not the first time they've called,
is it, Dad?

21:30.310 --> 21:34.320
Jonathan, how could you keep this
from us?

21:34.400 --> 21:36.127
We're in this as a family.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.977
Are we? You were never happy
about me running...

21:39.070 --> 21:40.625
and now you want me to quit.

21:40.780 --> 21:45.163
Maybe you're willing to risk your life
over this, but I'm not willing to watch.

21:45.290 --> 21:47.734
I have got to see this thing through,
Martha.

21:52.210 --> 21:53.937
Do as I say, not as I do, huh, Dad?

21:54.040 --> 21:56.535
Look, I never taught you
to buckle under pressure.

21:56.630 --> 21:58.317
Especially not from Lex Luthor.

21:58.470 --> 21:59.854
Lex?

22:00.880 --> 22:02.314
You think he'd go this far?

22:02.430 --> 22:05.500
There's no limit
to what Lex Luthor would do, son.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.638
Clark, I heard what happened.

22:18.740 --> 22:20.588
I wanna make sure
your father's okay.

22:20.700 --> 22:24.447
Trust me, this is about as close to
my father as you wanna get right now.

22:24.530 --> 22:26.096
He thinks I was behind it?

22:26.240 --> 22:28.603
- What do you expect him to believe?
- The truth.

22:28.750 --> 22:31.144
I issued a press release
denouncing the attack...

22:31.250 --> 22:34.957
and offered a reward for information
leading to the assailants' capture.

22:42.180 --> 22:45.503
Lex, why is some state senate seat
so important to you?

22:46.350 --> 22:48.663
It's a stepping stone.

22:49.810 --> 22:50.901
To what?

22:53.020 --> 22:57.111
It's like Apollo asking Icarus
why he's building wings.

22:57.230 --> 23:01.240
You have everything you've ever wanted.
I'm sorry if I'm still searching.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.966
What if you don't win?

23:03.070 --> 23:06.948
What if you get to the capitol and
haven't found what you're looking for?

23:07.030 --> 23:09.181
There's always the White House.

23:10.620 --> 23:14.074
Look, I promise you, we're gonna
find out who did this to your dad.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.722
Didn't work. We failed him.

23:37.860 --> 23:40.173
Well, now we know
what we need to do.

23:40.280 --> 23:44.027
- And I already have everything in place.
- Samantha, chill out.

23:44.110 --> 23:47.312
We already went too far,
and it totally backfired.

23:47.410 --> 23:49.470
We need to turn ourselves in...

23:49.580 --> 23:52.186
before somebody points
the finger at Lex.

23:52.330 --> 23:55.905
Lex asked us to go the extra 10 miles.

23:57.670 --> 24:00.740
- Am I the only one willing to do that?
- What are you saying?

24:00.840 --> 24:04.880
There is one thing
that Kent can't bounce back from.

24:05.010 --> 24:08.131
I'm going to the cops
before this gets any more out of control.

24:22.230 --> 24:26.452
Lex would have never...

24:27.280 --> 24:29.643
given up that easily.

25:25.380 --> 25:28.541
I waited at the drop-off,
but Griff never showed.

25:28.630 --> 25:30.993
Find out what happened to him.

25:40.310 --> 25:43.683
I didn't recognize you for a moment.

25:49.320 --> 25:54.168
I wanted to show you
how devoted I am to you.

25:55.790 --> 25:57.426
Well, you certainly have.

25:57.580 --> 26:01.034
I have all the enabling devices
I need, thank you.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.615
Though, apparently,
I could use better security.

26:06.590 --> 26:12.064
Don't they always say never use
your birthday as your security code?

26:14.300 --> 26:17.047
Or more specifically...

26:17.180 --> 26:18.655
your brother's?

26:21.310 --> 26:23.381
Interesting choice of perfume.

26:23.520 --> 26:27.651
<i>Hermès</i>. It's your favorite.

26:27.730 --> 26:31.528
I know everything about you,
Mr. Senator.

26:31.610 --> 26:33.388
Senator.

26:33.490 --> 26:35.722
Now, aren't you
a little ahead of yourself?

26:35.870 --> 26:39.153
Not now. Not with Jonathan Kent
out of the picture.

26:40.160 --> 26:43.705
I would never condone
what happened to Mr. Kent.

26:46.420 --> 26:50.713
Of course not.
You've got to distance yourself.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.901
It's like you said in the "Herald" article:

26:53.010 --> 26:56.040
"Strike when you can,
but never leave yourself vulnerable."

26:57.470 --> 27:00.379
Please tell me you weren't responsible
for that attack.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.580
It's okay, Lex.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.713
I know what you want me to do...

27:05.810 --> 27:08.598
and I would never want you
to take the fall for it.

27:08.730 --> 27:11.174
You may have read
everything about me...

27:11.320 --> 27:13.845
but don't assume you know me.

27:13.950 --> 27:16.091
I would never hurt the Kents.

27:16.580 --> 27:19.145
You're losing your edge, Lex.

27:19.750 --> 27:22.396
And you've clearly gone over it.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.201
My security will escort you
to the police station.

27:41.430 --> 27:44.763
You're just having
a moment of weakness.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.713
That's why you need me.

27:53.740 --> 27:57.103
Lex Luthor going "Godfather"
on your dad? I don't know, Clark.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.614
Lex seems like the guy who lives
for the fight as much as the victory.

28:00.700 --> 28:03.356
Here's a list of the calls
logged on our phone today.

28:03.460 --> 28:06.197
Dad pawned that one off
as a wrong number. It's blocked.

28:06.290 --> 28:09.916
I'll let my fingers do the walking.
Just give me a second.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.001
It's not like your dad
to keep something like this a secret.

28:14.130 --> 28:17.584
He's turned into a different person,
like he's got something to prove.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.700
Maybe just to his son.

28:20.470 --> 28:22.874
What does running for senator
have to do with me?

28:23.020 --> 28:26.131
Think about it, Clark.
It must be hard being a role model...

28:26.230 --> 28:29.977
for a guy who pulls people out of
a burning building and stops missiles...

28:30.070 --> 28:31.878
all between chores and dinner.

28:32.030 --> 28:34.171
- No one's expecting him to do that.
- True.

28:34.320 --> 28:36.380
But it's not gonna stop him
from trying.

28:36.490 --> 28:40.237
Oh, here we go.
Let's see what we got.

28:40.870 --> 28:42.304
All right.

28:42.410 --> 28:45.612
The call was made from...

28:48.080 --> 28:50.817
The Students for Lex Luthor office
at CKU.

29:52.310 --> 29:55.764
To do my part to put the 'heart' back
in the "Heartland."

29:55.860 --> 29:58.304
- Great closing line.
- They're Martha's words.

29:58.400 --> 30:02.107
I just hope she shows up in time
to hear me say them.

30:02.990 --> 30:05.899
Are you sure you wanna do this?
We have extra security...

30:05.990 --> 30:07.848
but it's not too late to postpone.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.707
What kind of leader would I be if I let
some pranksters make me back down?

30:12.580 --> 30:14.438
<i>And now, the next senator...</i>

30:14.540 --> 30:16.944
- Jacket?
- Oh, yeah.

30:17.050 --> 30:20.252
- "Mr. Jonathan Kent!"
- You look wonderful.

30:20.760 --> 30:23.325
- Knock them dead, boss.
- Yeah.

30:37.230 --> 30:39.169
Thank you.

30:43.370 --> 30:45.471
Thank you. Really, thank you.

30:45.580 --> 30:47.853
- Thank you all very much for...
- Excuse me.

30:50.460 --> 30:52.228
Hey.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.658
When I told my family that I had...

31:00.760 --> 31:03.113
indeed, decided
to run against Lex Luthor...

31:03.220 --> 31:05.412
they were surprised,
to say the least.

31:05.970 --> 31:09.384
But their support
has been unwavering.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.914
You see, I've been inspired.

31:12.020 --> 31:14.888
I've been inspired by my son,
whose courage seems to...

31:15.440 --> 31:18.763
- Talk about an initiation gone wrong.
- Get up.

31:18.900 --> 31:22.778
Those basic training skills
are looking a little rusty.

31:23.780 --> 31:27.113
Like I said, know your enemy.

31:27.240 --> 31:30.230
Look, magna cum laude psycho...

31:30.750 --> 31:33.063
you are not gonna shoot
Jonathan Kent.

31:33.210 --> 31:34.806
You're right.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.020
You are.

31:40.420 --> 31:45.733
In fact, it is because of my family
that I have the courage to run at all.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.708
I don't think they really understood...

31:49.600 --> 31:54.185
why I want to run or why this is
so very important to me.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.146
But the truth is actually...
It's actually very simple.

31:59.520 --> 32:03.065
The courage to help all Kansans,
whether they're rich...

32:03.150 --> 32:05.938
Nobody will ever believe
I would shoot Jonathan Kent.

32:07.570 --> 32:09.762
Really?

32:09.910 --> 32:12.728
Beautiful girl comes to live
under his roof.

32:12.870 --> 32:15.860
His wife gets a little too busy
at that coffee shop.

32:15.960 --> 32:19.243
Suddenly, he fires
a seasoned political consultant...

32:19.380 --> 32:22.117
and takes the girl
on the campaign trail.

32:22.210 --> 32:24.614
Until it all goes wrong...

32:24.720 --> 32:27.750
and the spurned lover
gets her revenge.

32:27.890 --> 32:30.587
Now, just aim
at Jonathan's head and shoot.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.700
Didn't General Lane
teach you anything?

32:32.850 --> 32:35.082
Actually, he did.

33:32.530 --> 33:34.055
Get down, sir.

33:35.870 --> 33:37.133
Martha?

33:50.720 --> 33:52.871
- Lois.
- Don't sweat it, Smallville.

33:52.970 --> 33:55.121
Better late than never.

34:26.050 --> 34:28.322
"Regard your soldiers
as your children...

34:28.420 --> 34:31.621
and they will follow you
into the deepest valleys."

34:31.719 --> 34:34.538
"Look on them as your own
beloved sons, and they..."

34:34.679 --> 34:37.123
"Will stand by you,
even unto death."

34:37.560 --> 34:40.670
You really don't have to quote
"The Art of War" to me, Dad.

34:40.770 --> 34:44.143
I read it cover to cover three times
before I finished high school.

34:45.360 --> 34:49.279
Although, I still would have preferred
a bike for my 14th birthday.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.389
Yes. Well, despite
your intense studies...

34:52.530 --> 34:55.650
it seems Jonathan Kent,
after yesterday's theatrics...

34:55.739 --> 34:58.063
has surged ahead of you
in the polls.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.695
- I didn't have anything to do with that.
- No, no, of course you didn't.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.911
It looks like your disciples
tried to follow in your footsteps.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.161
They have succeeded
in creating quite a mess.

35:08.250 --> 35:12.724
How does it feel, Lex,
to have people worship you?

35:12.840 --> 35:16.890
Being the idol for a cult of psychopaths
isn't exactly a power trip, Dad.

35:16.970 --> 35:20.091
No, but I suppose being
a state senator would be.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.378
Isn't that why
you're running for office?

35:23.600 --> 35:25.499
You wanna know the truth?

35:26.190 --> 35:29.099
I'm running because it's something
I have to work for.

35:29.530 --> 35:34.247
Yes. And your noble efforts
include employing hired guns...

35:34.320 --> 35:38.198
to dig up information about the Kents
that could destroy them.

35:39.080 --> 35:43.373
Well, so much for your fatherly pride
and support in this campaign, huh, Dad?

35:45.330 --> 35:46.855
Griff's dead.

35:47.960 --> 35:51.374
His body turned up in the back alley
of Suicide Slums this morning.

35:51.460 --> 35:54.116
And somehow, I don't think
the Kents did it.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.956
Dangerous neighborhood, Lex.

35:58.970 --> 36:03.434
Would it have killed you this one time
to actually be on my side?

36:04.140 --> 36:06.756
You're slipping, son.

36:06.860 --> 36:11.910
First Professor Milton Fine vanishes
from your radar. Now, Griff. It...

36:13.700 --> 36:16.013
It might be time to dust this off.

36:28.140 --> 36:30.039
- All the teachers will be there?
- Yes.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.746
All right. Great.

36:31.850 --> 36:34.759
And here are the talking points
for the teachers' union.

36:34.850 --> 36:37.759
- And don't forget...
- I've got the firefighters' breakfast.

36:37.860 --> 36:40.718
Don't worry, Lois,
I'm not gonna forget.

36:40.820 --> 36:43.385
Firefighters. I might have
to tag along for that one.

36:43.490 --> 36:46.813
- There's gotta be a few perks to this job.
- Good news.

36:46.910 --> 36:50.324
You're up 10 points in the polls
after the rally yesterday.

36:50.450 --> 36:53.652
Looks like we can
win this thing after all, huh?

36:53.750 --> 36:56.992
- I gotta run. Bye.
- Bye.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.985
It's great to see him so optimistic.

37:01.130 --> 37:02.817
Yeah.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.576
I hate to be the one
to burst his bubble.

37:06.010 --> 37:07.404
What do you mean?

37:07.550 --> 37:10.247
Lex is running 800 ads
and dropping three mailers...

37:10.350 --> 37:11.784
in the next two weeks.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.788
We're ahead,
but that much coverage...

37:13.940 --> 37:17.849
will make Mr. Kent
a distant memory by election day.

37:17.940 --> 37:19.960
And as far as I can tell...

37:20.070 --> 37:21.454
We're out of money.

37:24.860 --> 37:29.072
I've been trying to figure out
how to tell him for a couple of days.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.008
If we don't find some major green...

37:31.120 --> 37:34.574
he can kiss that fancy leather chair
at the capitol goodbye.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.162
There is one other option.

37:41.630 --> 37:45.458
But you have to promise me
never to tell Jonathan.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.451
Lana.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.258
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

38:05.400 --> 38:08.481
I wasn't about to leave things
the way they were.

38:08.570 --> 38:10.893
- Look, Clark...
- Look, Lana, I...

38:15.580 --> 38:17.984
You were right.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.403
I was pulling away.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.586
It's because I've been wanting
to be with you for so long.

38:26.340 --> 38:28.956
But I feel like I'd just screw it up.

38:31.300 --> 38:34.714
Clark, I would never
let you go that easily.

38:35.640 --> 38:40.993
Maybe we just need to slow down
and try and get back to where we were.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.092
I freak out...

38:51.870 --> 38:55.486
I screw up and I blame everything
on you, and you forgive me.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.270
No questions asked.

38:58.410 --> 39:02.036
Maybe that's because it's not
all your fault.

39:03.590 --> 39:06.327
What you said about me
running off to Met U...

39:06.420 --> 39:08.905
and getting all caught up
in my homework.

39:09.010 --> 39:12.424
It's not entirely false.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.084
Clark, I've been studying
the meteor showers.

39:21.900 --> 39:25.980
- You were gonna leave that in the past.
- I know I did, and I tried to.

39:26.070 --> 39:30.655
But those meteors changed my life.
And now with the second shower...

39:31.660 --> 39:33.720
Clark, there is no way
that they're random.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.594
What are you saying?

39:36.740 --> 39:41.043
Okay, well, you know that spacecraft
that I saw during this last shower?

39:41.170 --> 39:44.917
I was looking into the satellite imagery
from the first meteor shower...

39:45.040 --> 39:47.020
The one that happened
when we were kids.

39:47.130 --> 39:49.322
And there's something
that doesn't crash...

39:49.420 --> 39:52.036
