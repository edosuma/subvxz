- IN THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.409 --> 00:10.344
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES
ARE CONSIDERED

00:10.378 --> 00:12.113
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.515
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.548 --> 00:16.350
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.384 --> 00:18.119
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD
KNOWN AS

00:18.152 --> 00:19.720
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.223
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.693
[shouting, jeering,
chanting]

00:37.705 --> 00:40.841
- HEY, RAND,
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.510
- I'M SERVING MY COUNTRY,
MY FRIEND.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.513
I SLEEP JUST FINE.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.448
- WELCOME BACK
TO THE BUSINESS REPORT.

00:47.481 --> 00:51.385
MY GUEST IS WILLIAM RAND,
CEO OF BATTLE TESTED SECURITY,

00:51.419 --> 00:53.387
THE LARGEST PRIVATE
MILITARY CONTRACTOR

00:53.421 --> 00:54.488
IN THE WORLD.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.625
ANOTHER GREAT QUARTER
FOR BATTLE TESTED SECURITY.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.593
THE TROOP DRAW-DOWN'S
BEEN VERY GOOD FOR US.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.796
WE'VE GOT 50,000 PEOPLE
WORLDWIDE DOING THE ARMY'S JOB

01:02.830 --> 01:04.532
MORE CHEAPLY AND EFFICIENTLY.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.468
- I TOLD YOU I'VE GOT
A SURPRISE FOR YOU, RIGHT?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.137
SURPRISE.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.804
- MOMMY! MOMMY!

01:10.838 --> 01:15.476
- OOH...HI, SWEETHEART!

01:15.509 --> 01:18.612
OH, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.081
- WELCOME HOME.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.528
- LONG DAY, SIR?

01:34.562 --> 01:37.298
- THEY'RE ALL LONG, PAL.

01:57.485 --> 02:00.921
[electric window humming]

02:00.954 --> 02:03.524
HEY, WHY ARE WE GOING
UPTOWN?

02:03.557 --> 02:05.659
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GOING
TO THE HELIPORT.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.661
- RELAX, MR. RAND.
THERE'S TUNNEL TRAFFIC.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.768
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
COME ON UP THIS WAY.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.206
THIS IS A MEMORIAL
TO SOLDIERS AND SAILORS

02:18.239 --> 02:19.773
WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.243
WHAT IS IT, TOMMY?

02:23.677 --> 02:25.613
OKAY.
GIVE ME JUST A SECOND.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.788
GET THE KIDS OUT OF HERE.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.258
UM, I'LL CALL 911.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.829
[Law & Order theme]

02:41.862 --> 02:49.870
*

03:26.006 --> 03:27.040
- I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.743
- WELL, WE THINK THAT
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN DRUGGED.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.845
CAN YOU TELL US
THE LAST THING YOU REMEMBER?

03:31.879 --> 03:36.584
- THE DRIVER...
I WAS IN A LIMOUSINE...

03:36.617 --> 03:39.487
WENT THE WRONG WAY.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.754
HE WASN'T ONE
OF MY REGULARS.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.423
HE WAS SENT
BY THE TV STUDIO.

03:42.456 --> 03:46.960
- WE'LL NEED THE NAME
OF YOUR CONTACT.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.662
- GINNIE CAN GET THAT
FOR YOU.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.365
- VIRGINIA PELL, DETECTIVES.
GENERAL COUNSEL.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.566
EMAILING IT NOW.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.302
- GREAT. THIS DRIVER,

03:54.335 --> 03:56.670
DID HE GIVE YOU ANYTHING
TO DRINK, ANY WATER?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.572
ANYTHING ELSE IN THE LIMO?

03:58.606 --> 04:01.008
- YES, I DID HAVE
SOME BOTTLED WATER.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.443
- OKAY.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.545
SO WHEN THE TOX SCREEN
COMES BACK,

04:04.578 --> 04:06.480
IT'LL SHOW WHETHER OR NOT
THEY GAVE YOU ROHYPNOL

04:06.514 --> 04:07.881
OR ANY OTHER SEDATIVE.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.050
- DON'T YOU NEED MY PERMISSION
TO LOOK AT THOSE RECORDS?

04:10.083 --> 04:14.588
- MR. RAND...
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.727
- BETH, CAN YOU SEE
WHERE THAT NURSE IS?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.862
THESE BANDAGES ARE ON
TOO TIGHT.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.832
- OF COURSE, HONEY.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.769
- WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I WAS RAPED?

04:28.802 --> 04:31.572
- MR. RAND,
YOU WERE FOUND DRUGGED,

04:31.605 --> 04:33.841
BEATEN, AND WITH YOUR CLOTHES
RIPPED OFF.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.743
- I WASN'T RAPED!

04:35.776 --> 04:37.811
I WAS ATTACKED BY AN ENEMY
TRYING TO HUMILIATE ME

04:37.845 --> 04:39.780
BECAUSE OF THE WORK I DO.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.082
- MR. RAND HAS BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.684
HE NEEDS TO REST NOW.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.922
- OKAY.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.058
- I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,
DETECTIVES,

04:51.091 --> 04:51.959
BUT WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.595
WE HAVE OUR OWN TEAM
OF INVESTIGATORS.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.730
- WE DON'T SUBCONTRACT
OUR INVESTIGATIONS.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.766
- YOU DO UNDERSTAND
THE DELICACY OF THE SITUATION.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.568
WE NEED TO CONTROL
THE PUBLICITY HERE.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.035
- ALL OF OUR CASES
ARE SENSITIVE.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.771
- WE NEED YOUR COOPERATION,

05:03.804 --> 05:07.508
UNLESS YOU WANT US
TO START ISSUING SUBPOENAS.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.709
- ALL RIGHT.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.077
I'LL BE IN TOUCH,
DETECTIVES.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.946
- THANK YOU.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.885
- WELL, THE DRIVER THAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO PICK UP RAND

05:17.918 --> 05:19.052
GOT A CALL
TWO HOURS PRIOR

05:19.086 --> 05:20.754
TELLING HIM
THAT THE JOB WAS CANCELLED.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.089
- FROM WHO?
- RAND'S OFFICE.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.924
WHOEVER MADE THE CALL
SPOOFED THE NUMBER.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.059
- I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.795
- THAT WAS FAST.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.363
- WELL, IN CASE
YOU HADN'T NOTICED,

05:29.397 --> 05:31.699
CEOs ARE A PRIORITY
FOR HIS TEAM.

05:31.732 --> 05:32.833
THEY WANT TO BE KEPT
IN THE LOOP.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.403
SO WHERE ARE WE?
- THE FAKE CALLER I.D.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.971
WAS SET UP BY SOMEONE USING
ORANGE BOX SOFTWARE.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.508
- OKAY. AND RAND
IS EX-MILITARY.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.776
- HE'S A FORMER
ARMY RANGER.

05:42.810 --> 05:46.914
BUILT UP HIS COMPANY
GUARDING DIPLOMATS

05:46.947 --> 05:49.817
IN MILITARY BASES
WITH PRIVATE SECURITY.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.585
- COULD BE A TERRORIST TARGET.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.922
- THEY WROTE "PAYBACK
IS A BITCH" ON HIS LEG.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.957
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AL-QAEDA.
IT SOUNDS PERSONAL.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.727
- OKAY.
EXTRACURRICULARS?

05:59.760 --> 06:02.496
- NO BIMBO ERUPTIONS.
HE'S GOT A STABLE MARRIAGE.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.864
STAYS OUT OF THE HEADLINES.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.766
- EXCEPT WHEN HE'S HYPING
HIS COMPANY.

06:05.799 --> 06:06.634
[crowd on video jeering]

06:06.667 --> 06:08.769
THIS IS HIM GOING
INTO THE TV STUDIO

06:08.802 --> 06:10.070
RIGHT BEFORE
HE WAS ABDUCTED.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.905
"OCCUPY WALL STREET"
GOT IN HIS FACE.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.608
- HEY, RAND,
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?

06:14.642 --> 06:16.043
- I'M SERVING MY COUNTRY,
MY FRIEND.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.879
I SLEEP JUST FINE.

06:18.912 --> 06:22.550
- YEAH, THAT'S ME.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.117
IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEONE
CALLED THAT GOON OUT.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.687
- WELL, YOU GOT PRETTY CHESTY
WITH HIM, DIDN'T YOU?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.755
- HE'S A WAR CRIMINAL.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.491
HE WANTS TO GO ON TV
AND BRAG ABOUT THE PROFITS,

06:30.524 --> 06:31.625
I'LL GET IN HIS FACE.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.127
- DOES THAT INCLUDE
KIDNAPPING?

06:34.161 --> 06:36.564
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:36.597 --> 06:38.566
- SO WHERE WERE YOU
AT 6:00 LAST NIGHT?

06:38.599 --> 06:42.903
- UPTOWN AT A DRUM CIRCLE
OUTSIDE THE MAYOR'S HOUSE.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.573
- LOOK, SOMETHING HAPPENED
YESTERDAY

06:45.606 --> 06:47.207
THAT COULD TARNISH
YOUR MOVEMENT'S IMAGE.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.443
- YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO'S
MOST AGGRESSIVE TOWARD RAND?

06:49.477 --> 06:51.612
ONE OF THE GUYS
YOU PLANTED.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.946
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE WAS OUR GUY?

06:52.980 --> 06:54.582
- MILITARY BUILD, 50...

06:54.615 --> 06:58.786
SAW HIM GETTING INTO A PICKUP
AFTER A PROTEST LAST WEEK.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.088
HE HADN'T EVEN BOTHERED TO TAKE
THE "SPECIAL FORCES" STICKER

07:01.121 --> 07:03.491
OFF THE BACK WINDOW.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.894
- ALL RIGHT, SO HERE'S
YOUR BLACK PICKUP.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.996
IT'S FROM POLICE VIDEO
TWO MONTHS AGO.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.031
IT'S OUTSIDE RAND'S CONDO.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.766
THEN A MONTH LATER,
THERE'S OUR GUY

07:12.800 --> 07:14.134
OUTSIDE A SOHO BENEFIT.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.170
AND LAST WEEK, NEAR
BATTLE TESTED'S HEADQUARTERS.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.172
- LET ME GUESS--
THE PICKUP'S REGISTERED

07:19.206 --> 07:20.641
TO A DEAD NUN.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.976
- NOT UNLESS HER NAME
IS DONALD O'KEEFFE.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.479
- LIVES IN WHITE PLAINS.
HE'S A FORMER MARINE,

07:25.513 --> 07:26.880
SPECIAL OPERATIONS.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.882
- THAT'S NOT TOO STEALTH
FOR A KIDNAPPER.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.884
- OR BLACK OPS GUY.
- RAND'S PEOPLE KNOW HIM?

07:30.918 --> 07:32.553
- OH, THEY'RE DRAGGING
THEIR FEET

07:32.586 --> 07:34.488
ABOUT TURNING OVER
THE PHONE RECORDS AND EMAILS.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.657
- THEY DON'T WANT US
TO FIND OUT WHO KIDNAPPED HIM?

07:36.690 --> 07:38.559
- OR WHY HE'D TAKE IT
THIS FAR.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.061
O'KEEFFE'S RETIRED.
WE GOT A DAY JOB FOR HIM?

07:41.094 --> 07:43.230
- HE'S BEEN DOING SECURITY
FOR OIL TANKERS.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.898
A LOT OF TRAVEL
TO SOMALIA.

07:44.932 --> 07:48.035
- OKAY, HANDLE WITH CARE.

07:48.068 --> 07:52.139
THIS IS A MAN WHO SHOOTS PIRATES
FOR A LIVING.

08:01.982 --> 08:06.520
- O'KEEFFE...
WE NEED A WORD WITH YOU.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.257
- THIS ABOUT WILLIAM RAND?

08:10.290 --> 08:13.627
- OKAY, TAKE IT EASY, MAN.
- DONALD,

08:13.661 --> 08:15.629
DON'T MAKE THIS HARDER.

08:23.236 --> 08:27.040
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

08:27.074 --> 08:32.813
AFTER WHAT THEY DID
TO MY LITTLE GIRL...

08:32.846 --> 08:35.048
RAND GOT WHAT HE DESERVED.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.658
- SO YOU CANCELLED
THE PICKUP,

08:44.692 --> 08:46.326
POSED AS RAND'S DRIVER,

08:46.359 --> 08:47.995
THEN ROOFIED HIM.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.964
- YEP.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.801
BUT IT ALL COMES BACK
TO MY DAUGHTER.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.604
YOU TAKE CARE OF HER CASE,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOURS.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.005
- LOOK, DUDE,
WE'RE NOT HERE

08:58.038 --> 08:59.607
TO PLAY LET'S MAKE A DEAL
WITH YOU.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.974
JUST TELL US WHAT YOU DID.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.677
- JUST...HANG ON.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER?

09:03.711 --> 09:07.180
WHAT'S HER CONNECTION
TO RAND?

09:07.214 --> 09:10.017
- SHE WORKED FOR HIS COMPANY
IN BASRA.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.220
A MONTH AFTER SHE STARTED...

09:13.253 --> 09:15.222
FOUR OF THOSE ANIMALS DRUGGED
AND RAPED HER.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.090
- MEN SHE WORKED WITH?

09:17.124 --> 09:19.660
DID SHE REPORT IT?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.595
- TO THE NEAREST
BASE COMMANDER.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.097
HE SAID THEY WEREN'T
MILITARY.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.999
FOUR YEARS WE'VE BEEN TRYING.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.201
THE STATE DEPARTMENT,
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.004
- FOUR YEARS, AND NO CHARGES
HAVE EVER BEEN FILED?

09:31.038 --> 09:34.942
- D.O.J. CAVED
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.944
NO ONE WANTS
TO TAKE THESE GUYS ON.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.979
- SO A RAPE
FOR ANOTHER RAPE.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.114
THAT MAKES IT OKAY TO YOU.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.885
- I GAVE HIM JUST ENOUGH
OF THE BATON

09:44.918 --> 09:47.187
TO MAKE HIM THINK ABOUT IT...

09:47.220 --> 09:49.823
EVERY TIME HE SITS DOWN.

10:00.300 --> 10:04.237
- HE'S NOT MAKING IT UP--
THE PART ABOUT THE DAUGHTER.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.007
- IT DOESN'T MITIGATE.
ASSAULT, KIDNAPPING...

10:07.040 --> 10:08.942
WE'RE NOT HERE
TO MAKE DEALS WITH VIGILANTES.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.311
THERE ARE LEGAL AVENUES
FOR SETTLING SCORES.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.280
- ALL OF WHICH HE TRIED, CAP.
[cell phone chimes]

10:13.313 --> 10:15.983
- WE'RE NOT BASRA P.D.
LET'S JUST STICK TO OUR JOB.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.085
- RAND HAS DECIDED
TO WORK WITH US.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.121
HE WANTS TO COME IN
AND MAKE THE I.D.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.072
- TAKE YOUR TIME.
- SORRY.

10:39.106 --> 10:42.776
THE DRUG MUST HAVE WIPED
MY MEMORY THAT NIGHT.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.312
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
A LONGER LOOK?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.881
- APPRECIATE ALL YOU'RE DOING.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.055
- HE CALLED,
ASKED TO COME IN,

10:55.088 --> 10:56.323
THEN TANKED THE I.D.?

10:56.356 --> 10:57.891
- WELL, HE GOT OUT OF THERE
FAST ENOUGH

10:57.925 --> 10:59.059
ONCE HE SAW DONALD.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.460
- HE COULD HAVE JUST
BEEN EYEBALLING DONALD

11:00.493 --> 11:02.696
SO HIS GUYS COULD
TAKE CARE OF HIM LATER.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.397
- MAYBE RAND DOESN'T WANT US
LOOKING INTO WHAT HAPPENED

11:04.431 --> 11:05.733
OVER THERE.

11:05.766 --> 11:09.136
- NEITHER DO I.
IT'S NOT OUR CONCERN.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.003
- HOLD ON, CAPTAIN.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.773
LET US AT LEAST TALK
TO HIS DAUGHTER.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.876
- ALL DUE RESPECT, THIS SPEAKS
TO O'KEEFFE'S MOTIVE.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.044
IT'S PART OF THIS CASE TOO.

11:17.077 --> 11:21.414
- JUST REMEMBER WHICH CRIME
YOU'RE INVESTIGATING HERE.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.084
UNDERSTOOD?

11:26.219 --> 11:28.922
- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOUR YEARS
FOR JUSTICE.

11:28.956 --> 11:32.092
THEN MY DAD LOSES IT,
AND YOU GUYS SHOW UP.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.794
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.228
HE DOESN'T DESERVE
TO BE IN JAIL.

11:35.262 --> 11:38.165
- HELP US UNDERSTAND
WHY YOUR FATHER SNAPPED.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.167
LOOK, WE WANT TO HEAR
YOUR STORY.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.103
- WHY?
TO PROSECUTE MY DAD?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.471
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE,
ISN'T IT?

11:44.504 --> 11:45.973
- OFFICIALLY, YES.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.407
WE'RE HERE INVESTIGATING
YOUR FATHER'S CASE.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.978
BUT UNOFFICIALLY, CORY,
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE

11:51.011 --> 11:54.147
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
IS WRONG.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.520
- THE FIRST MONTH,
THE GUYS WEREN'T FRIENDLY,

12:00.553 --> 12:03.791
BUT THEY WERE PROFESSIONALS.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.393
THEN ONE NIGHT,
THEY HAD A PARTY.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.195
- WERE THERE OTHER WOMEN
INVITED?

12:08.228 --> 12:12.432
- I GUESS THEY KNEW
NOT TO GO.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.335
IAN KENT, ONE OF THE DEPUTIES
OF THE RECON TEAM,

12:15.368 --> 12:16.837
HE GAVE ME A DRINK.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.272
HE SAID I NEEDED
TO LOOSEN UP.

12:19.306 --> 12:24.077
A FEW MINUTES LATER,
I COULDN'T FEEL MY LEGS.

12:24.111 --> 12:28.515
IAN CARRIED ME
INTO HIS ROOM.

12:28.548 --> 12:32.886
THREE OF THEM
WERE IN THERE.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.055
- HOW MUCH OF THIS
DO YOU REMEMBER?

12:35.088 --> 12:40.193
- I WAS IN AND OUT,
BUT THEY WERE RAPING ME.

12:40.227 --> 12:46.466
THEY WERE BRUTAL...
CRUSHING ME.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.535
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

12:48.568 --> 12:52.840
I ASKED THEM
TO GIVE ME A BREAK.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.308
JUST A SECOND.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.945
THEY JUST LAUGHED.

13:03.851 --> 13:06.854
- CORY, HOW LONG
DID THIS GO ON?

13:06.887 --> 13:10.157
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.225
WHEN I CAME TO,

13:12.259 --> 13:15.228
I REALIZED I WAS
IN AN INTERROGATION ROOM

13:15.262 --> 13:18.098
WITH TWO ARMED GUARDS.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.000
- DID ANYONE TALK TO YOU?

13:20.033 --> 13:23.336
- JOE MARSHALL,
THEIR SUPERVISOR,

13:23.370 --> 13:26.306
TOLD ME I WAS IN THE ROOM
FOR MY PROTECTION.

13:26.339 --> 13:30.343
THEN HE ASKED ME IF I WAS
GONNA SUE THE COMPANY.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.079
- HOW LONG WERE YOU HELD?

13:32.112 --> 13:35.883
- 72 HOURS.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.852
THEN ONE OF THE GUARDS FINALLY
GAVE ME HIS CELL PHONE

13:38.886 --> 13:42.355
TO CALL MY DAD.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.891
THAT'S WHEN THEY
RELEASED ME,

13:43.924 --> 13:46.459
LET ME SEE A FEMALE
ARMY DOCTOR.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.896
- OKAY. DID THEY DO
A RAPE KIT?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.030
- YES.

13:50.063 --> 13:54.167
BUT BY THE TIME THE D.O.J.
STARTED THE INVESTIGATION,

13:54.201 --> 13:57.905
IT HAD DISAPPEARED.

13:57.938 --> 14:01.141
IT'S NOT JUST WHAT
THESE GUYS DID TO ME.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.311
IT'S THAT THEY KNEW
THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.417
- DONALD O'KEEFFE
WAS JUST ARRAIGNED.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.285
EVEN WITHOUT RAND'S I.D.,

14:12.319 --> 14:13.887
HE'S STILL GETTING
ONE TO EIGHT.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.322
- WHAT'D YOU GET
FROM THE DAUGHTER?

14:15.355 --> 14:18.258
- SHE AND THE FATHER
WENT THROUGH A NIGHTMARE.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.492
- SO HE GOES TO PRISON,

14:19.526 --> 14:21.294
BUT THE GUYS WHO RAPED HER--
NOTHING.

14:21.328 --> 14:25.598
- BENSON, AMARO.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.035
THIS IS DAVID HADEN,

14:28.068 --> 14:31.338
OUR NEW EXECUTIVE
ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.673
MR. HADEN, DETECTIVES
BENSON AND AMARO.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.475
- DETECTIVES.
- COUNSELOR.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.144
LAST I HEARD, YOU WERE HEAD
OF RACKETS.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.979
- WELL, THEY KICKED ME
UPSTAIRS.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.681
- MR. HADEN IS HERE
ABOUT THE RAND CASE.

14:41.714 --> 14:45.218
- NUMBER TWO IN THE D.A.'S
OFFICE HANDLING A SEX CRIME?

14:45.252 --> 14:47.254
- OFFICIALLY, THIS ISN'T
JUST A SEX CRIME.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.290
IT'S THE KIDNAPPING
OF A HIGH-PROFILE FIGURE.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.526
THE D.A. HAS ASKED ME
TO TAKE A PERSONAL INTEREST.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.029
- PERSONAL INTEREST...

14:56.063 --> 14:57.264
IN PROTECTING RAND'S IMAGE.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.333
- NICK.
- FAIR ENOUGH, DETECTIVE.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.302
I'M A SECOND-GENERATION D.A.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.337
I'M USED TO COPS
GIVING ME THE STINK EYE.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.306
- FORGIVE OUR SUSPICION,
COUNSELOR,

15:06.339 --> 15:08.075
BUT RAND IS NOT COOPERATING.

15:08.108 --> 15:12.345
AND OUR SUSPECT'S DAUGHTER
WAS GANG RAPED BY HIS EMPLOYEES.

15:12.379 --> 15:16.349
- IN BASRA.
AND JUSTICE DROPPED THE CASE.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.285
- I'M GUESSING YOU KNOW WHY.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.387
- NO, BUT I'D LIKE TO.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.489
I'LL SET UP A MEETING.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.692
I CAN EXPECT BOTH OF YOU
TO JOIN ME?

15:25.725 --> 15:28.962
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME,
CAPTAIN.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.367
- WHAT WAS THAT?

15:34.401 --> 15:38.671
- LET'S WATCH OUR STEP HERE
UNTIL WE KNOW HIS AGENDA.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.076
- YOUR OFFICE HASN'T
OVERREACHED ENOUGH?

15:43.110 --> 15:45.078
NOW YOU WANT TO PURSUE CASES
IN IRAQ.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.579
- WHY DIDN'T THE FEDS
STAY ON THIS?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.082
- WELL, FOR STARTERS, THERE WERE
PROBLEMS WITH THIS CASE.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.684
SPOTTY MEMORY.
NO RAPE KIT.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.686
- WE WERE TOLD
THERE WAS ONE.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.722
- IF THERE WAS,
IT GOT LOST IN IRAQ.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.524
IT'S A WAR ZONE.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.526
LOOK, I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,

15:59.559 --> 16:01.594
BUT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS
TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.031
- YOU MEAN NOW THAT
WE'RE PRIVATIZING WAR,

16:04.064 --> 16:05.198
THESE COMPANIES
ARE ABOVE THE LAW?

16:05.232 --> 16:08.368
- YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
CONTRACTORS AREN'T MILITARY.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.037
THEY CAN'T BE COURT-MARTIALED.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.272
AND ORDER 17 PUT THEM
ABOVE IRAQI LAW.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.441
- THEY CAN STILL BE PROSECUTED
BY D.O.J.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.775
- AT OUR DISCRETION.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.344
- OH, I SEE.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.112
YOU'RE SAYING
THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.747
- EVEN GANG RAPE
FEMALE EMPLOYEES

16:20.780 --> 16:23.216
WITHOUT ANY FEAR
OF REPRISAL.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.254
- THESE GUYS HAVE A LOT
OF JUICE IN WASHINGTON.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.589
I'M TELLING YOU THAT
AS A FRIEND, DAVID.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.628
- WELL, THAT WAS
A PROFILE IN COURAGE.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.630
- YOU CAN TELL THEY'VE GOT
THEIR MARCHING ORDERS.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.067
- NOW YOU KNOW WHY
CORY'S DAD SNAPPED.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.170
THESE GUYS ARE UNTOUCHABLE.
- MAYBE NOT.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.373
RAND'S HEADQUARTERS
ARE IN NEW YORK, RIGHT?

16:46.406 --> 16:48.808
IF WE CAN PROVE THERE'S BEEN
A COVER-UP OF THE RAPE

16:48.841 --> 16:52.079
DIRECTED FROM HERE,
WE'D HAVE JURISDICTION.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.746
- WHAT WOULD YOU NEED
FROM US?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.348
- HOW 'BOUT A REAL
INVESTIGATION?

16:55.382 --> 16:57.784
LET'S START
WITH THE RAPE KIT.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.690
- HEY, HOW MUCH DO YOU DEAL
WITH THESE

17:03.723 --> 17:05.758
CIVILIAN CONTRACTORS
OVER THERE?

17:05.792 --> 17:10.697
- AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.
THEY'RE COWBOYS.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.133
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR CASE?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.634
- YOU KNOW CORY?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.603
- MM-HMM.
- SHE SAYS SHE HAD A RAPE KIT

17:16.636 --> 17:20.773
DONE BY AN ARMY DOCTOR,
BUT THE KIT'S GONE MISSING.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.176
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE SOME CALLS?

17:23.210 --> 17:24.777
I KNOW PEOPLE
WHO WERE IN BASRA.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.780
- YOU CAN TRUST 'EM?

17:27.814 --> 17:30.150
I MEAN, THESE PEOPLE
HAVE REACH, M.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.753
- I KNOW.
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.856
- I KNOW, BUT...

17:36.889 --> 17:40.360
- CAN WE LET THIS GO
FOR NOW?

17:42.829 --> 17:45.865
I'M ONLY HERE
FOR A FEW MORE DAYS.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.835
- MMM...YEAH.
- MMM...YEAH?

17:54.441 --> 17:57.144
- DR. RAUSCH, YOU WORKED
ALL THE HOT SPOTS.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.712
FIRST BASRA,
NOW THE BRONX V.A.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.548
- I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH
I CAN HELP YOU.

18:01.581 --> 18:05.418
- BUT YOU REMEMBER CORY GREEN?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.889
- YES.
I REMEMBER CORY.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.892
I WAS ABOUT TO BE DEPOSED
ABOUT IT THREE YEARS AGO.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.895
I WAS TOLD THE CASE
HAS BEEN SETTLED.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.430
- HOW DID YOU END UP DOING
A RAPE KIT?

18:17.464 --> 18:19.266
- HER FATHER CALLED
THE BASE.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.269
SHE WASN'T MILITARY, BUT I WAS
THE CLOSEST DOCTOR AVAILABLE.

18:22.302 --> 18:26.806
- AND WHAT, EXACTLY,
DID THE EXAM SHOW?

18:26.839 --> 18:31.244
DR. RAUSCH...

18:31.278 --> 18:34.514
- THEY TORE HER APART.

18:34.547 --> 18:38.318
IT WAS A VIOLENT,
SUSTAINED GANG RAPE.

18:38.351 --> 18:42.155
- IT WAS ALL DOCUMENTED
IN THE RAPE KIT?

18:42.189 --> 18:44.591
- PHOTOS, SWABS, NOTES.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.294
PLUS HER CLOTHING,
COMPLETE WITH SEMEN STAINS

18:47.327 --> 18:49.162
FROM MULTIPLE DONORS.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.231
NO TRACES OF DRUGS
IN HER SYSTEM

18:51.264 --> 18:54.234
BECAUSE THEY HELD HER
FOR 72 HOURS.

18:54.267 --> 18:58.471
- WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
THE KIT'S CHAIN OF CUSTODY?

18:58.505 --> 19:01.474
- I GAVE IT TO MY
SUPERIOR OFFICERS.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.376
BUT I HEARD THEY HAD
NO JURISDICTION,

19:03.410 --> 19:08.481
SO THEY TURNED IT OVER
TO BATTLE-TESTED.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.750
- DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOU HEARD THAT?

19:10.783 --> 19:14.354
- ONE OF MY COs--
I'M NOT SAYING WHO--

19:14.387 --> 19:16.623
WAS COMPLAINING
THAT BATTLE-TESTED

19:16.656 --> 19:18.725
HAD THE RUN OF THE BASE.

19:18.758 --> 19:24.397
- WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO TESTIFY BEFORE A GRAND JURY?

19:33.473 --> 19:37.444
- I HAVE TO ADMIT, WE WERE NOT
SURE ABOUT YOU AT FIRST.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.280
- YOU CAN TRUST ME.
I'M AN ATTORNEY.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.514
- [chuckles]

19:41.548 --> 19:43.283
A LITTLE SECRET...

19:43.316 --> 19:46.319
I CAN BE A LITTLE TESTY
WHEN I WORK WITH NEW PEOPLE.

19:46.353 --> 19:50.723
- I CAN BE SOMEWHAT TESTY
AROUND MY KIDS.

19:50.757 --> 19:51.791
- YOU HAVE KIDS.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.227
- BOY AND A GIRL.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.596
THEY BOTH LIVE WITH MY EX-WIFE
IN COBBLE HILL.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.831
YOU?

19:58.865 --> 20:01.301
- ME.
UH...

20:01.334 --> 20:04.437
I'M JUST GETTING OVER
SOMETHING.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.641
- ISN'T EVERYONE.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.449
- CAN YOU STAY
FOR ANOTHER ROUND?

20:18.985 --> 20:23.423
- YOU KNOW, UM...
WHY DON'T WE CALL IT A NIGHT?

20:23.456 --> 20:24.757
YOU NEED A CLEAR HEAD

20:24.791 --> 20:26.793
IN FRONT OF THAT GRAND JURY
TOMORROW.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.499
- RAIN CHECK?

20:32.532 --> 20:35.435
- I'D LIKE THAT.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.673
- SO AS CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER
IN BASRA,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.309
YOU EXAMINED MILITARY PERSONNEL

20:42.342 --> 20:43.943
AND AMERICANS WORKING
IN THE AREA.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.545
- YES, SIR.
- INCLUDING CORY GREEN.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.946
- THAT'S CORRECT.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.915
- DR. RAUSCH,
YOU EXAMINED MS. GREEN

20:48.948 --> 20:51.351
72 HOURS AFTER
SHE HAD BEEN ASSAULTED.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.420
- I CAN'T SPEAK
TO THE LENGTH OF TIME.

20:56.823 --> 21:00.627
- BUT YOU DO RECALL THE DETAILS
OF YOUR RAPE EXAM?

21:00.660 --> 21:03.696
- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EVENTS
THAT HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO,

21:03.730 --> 21:07.567
AND I EXAMINED THOUSANDS
OF PATIENTS WHEN I WAS IN IRAQ.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.311
- DR. RAUSCH, YOU WERE
IN MY OFFICE YESTERDAY.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.980
YOU TOLD ME
YOU RECALL THE EXAM.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.983
YOU RECOUNTED SPECIFIC DETAILS
OF THE RAPE KIT.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.486
ISN'T THAT TRUE?

21:26.519 --> 21:28.655
- YES, SIR.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.424
BUT I HAVE SINCE REALIZED
THAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN

21:31.458 --> 21:36.596
CONFUSING THE DETAILS
WITH FACTS FROM OTHER CASES.

21:36.629 --> 21:40.066
- YOU DO REALIZE
YOU'RE UNDER OATH HERE?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.537
- YES, I DO.

21:49.776 --> 21:50.943
- RAND WORKS FAST.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.645
DR. RAUSCH ISN'T JUST
DUCKING OUR CALLS.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.747
SHE GAVE NOTICE
AT THE V.A. THIS MORNING.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.416
- WELL, WE'RE SITTING
ON THE HOUSE.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.917
SHE COMES OUT,
WE BRING HER IN.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.519
- OKAY,
GET YOUR TEAM STARTED

21:59.552 --> 22:01.120
ON TRACKING DOWN
THE OTHER WITNESSES.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.922
- ALREADY ON IT.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.957
- WHO'S THE GUY
ON THE RIGHT?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.393
- IAN KENT.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.960
HE BROUGHT ME THE DRINK
WITH THE DRUG IN IT.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.896
- WHERE IS HE NOW?

22:09.929 --> 22:11.564
- THE BATTLE-TESTED
SECURITY ZONE,

22:11.598 --> 22:12.899
ALONG WITH THESE TWO.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.702
THE COMPANY CLAIMS
THAT LOCATION'S CLASSIFIED.

22:15.735 --> 22:18.705
- OF COURSE THEY DO.
WHAT ABOUT THE LAST ONE?

22:18.738 --> 22:21.608
- WALLY BARTON.
I THOUGHT HE WAS MY FRIEND.

22:21.641 --> 22:25.412
- SO WE HAVE FOUR RAPISTS.
WHO'S JOE MARSHALL?

22:25.445 --> 22:27.447
- JOE MARSHALL,
THE HEAD OF DETAIL.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.949
HE HAD THEM ISOLATE ME
AFTERWARDS.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.418
- AND HE'S A COMPANY MAN.
HE JUST GOT PROMOTED

22:31.451 --> 22:32.819
TO SENIOR VP UNDER RAND.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.954
- OKAY, SO WE NEED SOMEBODY
UNDER HIM.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.123
CORY, TELL ME ABOUT
THE GUARDS.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.492
- THAT ONE NEVER
MADE EYE CONTACT.

22:39.526 --> 22:43.596
BUT GEORGE COLEMAN...
HE DIDN'T RAPE ME.

22:43.630 --> 22:47.867
HE'S THE ONE WHO GAVE ME
HIS CELL PHONE TO CALL HOME.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.538
- THE THING IS,
HE'S DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.506
HE LEFT THE COMPANY
THREE YEARS AGO.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.544
- WELL, WE BETTER FIND HIM
BEFORE THEY DO.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.480
- DR. RAUSCH RECANTED?
- [softly] YEAH.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.550
- RAND CAN INTIMIDATE
A WITNESS...NO CONSEQUENCES.

23:03.583 --> 23:08.521
- WELL, WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT
HOW HE GOT TO HER.

23:08.555 --> 23:13.560
- YOU KNOW, ALL MY LIFE I'VE
TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

23:13.593 --> 23:18.431
I SIGNED UP FOR THE MARINES
AS SOON AS I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL.

23:18.465 --> 23:22.602
WHEN MY COUNTRY
ASKED ME TO FIGHT, I WENT.

23:22.635 --> 23:27.574
AND I CONFESSED AND WAS READY
TO DO MY TIME...

23:27.607 --> 23:30.977
BECAUSE I TRUSTED YOU PEOPLE
TO GET JUSTICE FOR MY DAUGHTER.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.680
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
MR. O'KEEFFE.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.615
I HAVE A DAUGHTER TOO.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.850
- REALLY?

23:41.521 --> 23:46.526
DOES YOUR DAUGHTER FLINCH...
WHEN YOU TRY TO HUG HER?

23:46.559 --> 23:49.729
WAKE UP...

23:49.762 --> 23:51.931
SCREAMING IN THE NIGHT?

23:54.233 --> 23:57.904
WAS YOUR DAUGHTER RAPED...

23:57.937 --> 24:01.474
SO BRUTALLY...

24:01.508 --> 24:04.544
THAT SHE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO HAVE CHILDREN?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.151
[sniffles]

24:14.053 --> 24:18.224
- WE'RE GONNA GET THESE GUYS,
MR. O'KEEFFE.

24:18.257 --> 24:21.761
- PROVE IT.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.700
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME
MISS MY FLIGHT.

24:27.734 --> 24:30.537
- SO YOU'RE HEADING BACK
OVERSEAS AGAIN, HUH?

24:30.570 --> 24:32.605
- I JUST REALIZED THAT
I COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE

24:32.639 --> 24:33.773
IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.943
- THE ROYAL BAHRAIN
SURGICAL COLLEGE...

24:36.976 --> 24:38.911
WHERE RAND IS A TRUSTEE,
RIGHT?

24:38.945 --> 24:42.014
- SO YOU TOOK THEIR CALL
AND LOST YOUR MEMORY?

24:42.048 --> 24:43.983
WE CAN SUBPOENA
YOUR PHONE RECORDS.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.785
- LOOK, IT'S GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT

24:45.818 --> 24:47.153
FOR YOU TO MAKE IT
TO BAHRAIN

24:47.186 --> 24:50.790
WHEN YOU'RE STUCK HERE
FIGHTING A PERJURY CHARGE.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.792
- THEN CHARGE ME.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.694
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE LIKE.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.829
- WELL, CORY GREEN DOES.
- WE GET IT.

24:56.863 --> 24:59.599
BUT IF YOU DON'T
GIVE US SOMETHING,

24:59.632 --> 25:01.500
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ON THAT PLANE.

25:16.082 --> 25:22.154
- THEY HAD ME RUN TESTS...
ON FOUR MEN...

25:22.188 --> 25:25.324
FOR STDs.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.327
- CORY?
SHE HAD A MELTDOWN

25:28.360 --> 25:32.298
AFTER ONE OF THE MEN
IN MY DETAIL BROKE UP WITH HER.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.066
I NEVER WANTED HER
ON MY TEAM.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.303
SHE WAS UNSTABLE
FROM THE GET.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.038
- ONE OF THE MEN?

25:39.071 --> 25:42.709
NOW, IS THAT WHY YOU HAD
FOUR OF THEM TESTED FOR STDs?

25:42.742 --> 25:44.276
- THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS
ARE CONFIDENTIAL.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.177
THERE IS NO SUBPOENA.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.881
- VIRGINIA, IT'S IMMATERIAL.
- REALLY?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.316
AFTER CORY WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH CHLAMYDIA,

25:50.349 --> 25:52.819
THE REST OF THE TEAM
JUST HAPPENED TO GET TESTED?

25:57.890 --> 26:00.292
WERE YOU TESTED TOO?

26:00.326 --> 26:03.029
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MISS.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.797
I NEVER TOUCHED THAT GIRL.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.667
I GOT A WIFE
AND THREE DAUGHTERS.

26:07.700 --> 26:12.772
BUT SHE WENT BUCK-WILD
WHEN SHE GOT TO BASRA.

26:12.805 --> 26:16.042
- YEAH, 'CAUSE IRAQ
HAS THAT EFFECT ON WOMEN.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.779
- SOME GIRLS GET TURNED ON
BEING IN A WAR ZONE.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.982
AND THEY'LL GO FOR THE DUDE
WITH THE BIG GUNS.

26:26.919 --> 26:30.923
NOT SOME RAPE CRISIS
COUNSELOR.

26:30.957 --> 26:34.661
- SO IT WAS ALL CONSENSUAL...

26:34.694 --> 26:36.896
HER AND FOUR GUYS?

26:36.929 --> 26:39.732
AND THEY'RE ALL WILLING
TO HANG TOGETHER.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.168
- NO ONE'S GONNA TALK TO YOU.

26:42.201 --> 26:45.705
THIS COMPANY
IS BUILT ON LOYALTY.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.009
- GEORGE COLEMAN
FEEL THAT WAY?

26:50.042 --> 26:53.412
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T EVEN WORK
FOR THE TEAM ANYMORE.

26:53.445 --> 26:58.084
- GEORGE...HAS BEEN
IN EVERY DRUNK TANK

26:58.117 --> 27:00.252
BETWEEN HERE AND FLORIDA
THE LAST THREE YEARS.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.189
NO ONE TAKES HIS WORD
OVER OURS.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.957
- FISHING TRIP'S OVER.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.767
- NICE JOB.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.369
LET'S MAKE SOME CALLS
TO FLORIDA.

27:17.403 --> 27:23.676
- I THINK I CAN HANDLE
THAT ONE. OKAY?

27:23.710 --> 27:24.610
- YOU EXPECT ME
TO BE GRATEFUL.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.412
YOU DRAG ME BACK UP TO NEW YORK
IN WINTER.

27:26.445 --> 27:29.448
- NOBODY WANTS TO DRY OUT
IN A DRUNK TANK.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.317
NOT EVEN IN FLORIDA.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.419
- I GOT NOWHERE ELSE
TO BE.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.988
MY WIFE TOOK OFF
WITH MY KIDS AND MY MONEY.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.390
- WAS THE BEFORE OR AFTER
YOU STARTED DRINKING?

27:42.895 --> 27:44.096
- [clears throat]

27:44.130 --> 27:47.066
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
TO COME HOME

27:47.099 --> 27:49.468
WITH A PROBLEM.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.370
IT'S ANOTHER WORLD
OVER THERE.

27:51.403 --> 27:54.240
- WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW
ABOUT IT?

27:54.273 --> 27:56.776
- I WAS IN IRAQ.

27:56.809 --> 28:00.813
WORKING INTERROGATIONS
AFTER 9/11.

28:00.847 --> 28:07.319
I MEAN THE...
THE STRESS, THE...

28:07.353 --> 28:13.125
THE CHOICES
YOU HAVE TO MAKE.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.327
- PEOPLE DON'T KNOW.

28:18.497 --> 28:21.868
THEN YOU COME HOME,
AND YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.270
- SO YOU DRINK.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.774
- SO YOU DRINK.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.210
- WAS CORY GREEN
ONE OF THE THINGS

28:31.243 --> 28:33.445
THAT YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT?

28:37.850 --> 28:40.820
IT BOTHERED YOU WHAT HAPPENED
TO CORY, DIDN'T IT?

28:40.853 --> 28:45.191
WE KNOW THAT YOU LET HER
BORROW YOUR CELL PHONE.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.494
YOU WATCHED OUT FOR HER.

28:48.527 --> 28:52.131
- TWO ARMED GUARDS

28:52.164 --> 28:55.301
ON A BLEEDING,

28:55.334 --> 28:58.237
HALF-CONSCIOUS
110-POUND GIRL.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.073
IS THAT WHY YOU
GOT INTO THIS, GEORGE?

29:01.107 --> 29:03.776
- NO.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.511
THAT WASN'T MY CALL.

29:05.544 --> 29:06.879
- NO?

29:06.913 --> 29:09.281
WELL, THEN,
WHOSE CALL WAS IT?

29:12.584 --> 29:15.855
- JOE MARSHALL.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.456
HE'S RAND'S BITCH.

29:17.489 --> 29:18.958
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

29:18.991 --> 29:20.893
- I SAW ALL THE FAXES.

29:20.927 --> 29:24.130
THE ORDERS CAME STRAIGHT
FROM RAND'S OFFICE.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.336
[door opens]

29:30.369 --> 29:32.805
- COUPLE OF DAYS TO CLEAN UP,
HE'LL BE GOOD TO GO.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.141
- MY OFFICE CAN PUT HIM UP
IN A MOTEL.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.143
SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

29:37.176 --> 29:40.446
- BUT WE HAVE COMPANY.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.215
- MR. RAND
AND THE DEPUTY MAYOR

29:43.249 --> 29:46.853
WERE JUST HEADING TO A CITY
YOUTH CORPS EVENT DOWNTOWN.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.021
- THE COMMISSIONER ASKED ME
TO STICK MY HEAD IN

29:49.055 --> 29:50.489
AND SAY HELLO
TO YOUR CAPTAIN.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.324
- DAVID HADEN,
EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT

29:52.358 --> 29:55.928
TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.229
- WILLIAM,
I NEED TO RUN ON AHEAD.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.598
YOU'LL LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.001
DON.
- TINA.

30:04.603 --> 30:07.940
- I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN
THAT YOU'RE USING

30:07.974 --> 30:09.842
O'KEEFFE'S ASSAULT
AS A PRETEXT

30:09.876 --> 30:12.244
TO OPEN AN OLD
DISCREDITED CASE.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.847
- WE JUST FOLLOW THE LEADS
WHERE THEY TAKE US, MR. RAND.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.916
- TO A MENTALLY UNSTABLE
YOUNG WOMAN

30:16.949 --> 30:18.484
WHO'S BEEN IN AND OUT
OF PSYCHIATRIC CARE

30:18.517 --> 30:20.920
THE LAST FOUR YEARS?
- SO IT'S LIKE THAT, HUH?

30:20.953 --> 30:22.889
- DON'T LOOK SO CAUGHT OUT.

30:22.922 --> 30:25.557
I HAVE MY OWN
INTELLIGENCE DIVISION.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.927
EVERYONE HAS SKELETONS.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.897
- I'M GONNA PRETEND
THAT'S NOT A THREAT.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.602
- JUST ASK YOURSELF SOMETHING,
COUNSELOR.

30:36.635 --> 30:40.873
IS THIS THE BATTLE YOU WANT?
BECAUSE WAR IS MY BUSINESS.

30:40.907 --> 30:43.009
AND BUSINESS IS GOOD.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.446
HAVE A NICE EVENING.

30:51.918 --> 30:53.920
- THAT WAS SUBTLE.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.522
- SO RIGHT ABOUT NOW
YOU'RE ASKING YOURSELF,

30:56.555 --> 30:59.325
"WHAT HAVE WE GOTTEN
OURSELVES INTO?"

30:59.358 --> 31:03.896
- YOU KIDDING?
I LIVE FOR THIS.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.342
- LOOKING FOR BUGS...
OR BOTTLES?

31:16.375 --> 31:19.411
- TO BE HONEST, GEORGE,
BOTH.

31:19.445 --> 31:22.381
WE'VE ALL GOT A LOT RIDING
ON THIS.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.051
IT'S THE GRAND JURY TOMORROW.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.254
[security buzzer blares]

31:35.261 --> 31:37.930
- [screaming]
GET OFF ME!

31:37.964 --> 31:39.531
[screaming]

31:39.565 --> 31:41.300
GET OFF ME!

31:41.333 --> 31:44.003
[cell phone rings]

31:47.974 --> 31:49.308
- [grunts]
UH...UH!

31:59.751 --> 32:01.720
[woman screaming]
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:01.753 --> 32:04.090
HEY! HEY!

32:31.283 --> 32:34.453
- THE UNI SAID NO ONE CAME IN
AFTER I LEFT.

32:34.486 --> 32:38.090
- ALL THESE BOTTLES.
DID YOU SEARCH THE ROOM?

32:38.124 --> 32:42.094
- TOP TO BOTTOM.

32:42.128 --> 32:46.098
WE JUST MADE GEORGE COLEMAN
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.472
- WHAT'S THE DAMAGE REPORT?

32:53.505 --> 32:54.706
- CORY'S
GOT A BROKEN WRIST,

32:54.740 --> 32:56.208
AND THE SHIV MISSED
HER DAD'S KIDNEY

32:56.242 --> 32:57.543
BY 1/8TH OF AN INCH.
- EVERYBODY HERE OKAY?

32:57.576 --> 32:59.411
- I WAS GONNA MOVE
THAT COFFEE TABLE ANYWAY.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.113
CSU IS THERE NOW.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.115
- M.E. SAYS GEORGE COLEMAN'S
CAUSE OF DEATH

33:03.149 --> 33:04.716
WAS ALCOHOL POISONING.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.253
HAD FIVE TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT
IN HIS BLOOD.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.655
- THAT'S NOT BLACK OPS.
THAT'S HOUDINI.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.724
- OKAY, WE'RE DEALING WITH
A PRIVATE ARMY HERE

33:12.758 --> 33:14.760
OPERATING WITHOUT
LEGAL RESTRAINTS.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.229
- EVEN SO, TAKING ON NYPD?

33:17.263 --> 33:20.499
THE RAPE OF CORY HAS GOTTA BE
JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

33:20.532 --> 33:23.135
- WELL, LET'S NOT UNDERESTIMATE
WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.736
PUT ON YOUR VESTS,
CARRY YOUR RADIOS

33:24.770 --> 33:26.372
AND SIDEARMS AT ALL TIMES.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.274
NICK, YOU KNOW
WHAT THESE GUYS ARE LIKE.

33:28.307 --> 33:29.408
WE CAN HELP PROTECT
YOUR FAMILY.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.609
- I'M ALL-IN.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.311
- YES, SIR.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.280
- COME ON, CAP,
LET'S DO THE JOB.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.381
- OKAY, SOMEBODY GOT
THAT BOOZE

33:35.414 --> 33:37.283
INTO GEORGE COLEMAN'S
MOTEL ROOM.

33:37.316 --> 33:41.220
FIND OUT WHO KNEW
HE WAS EVEN THERE.

33:41.253 --> 33:46.392
- GEORGE'S LAST CALL...
WAS TO A LAND LINE...

33:46.425 --> 33:48.527
IN ROCKAWAY, QUEENS.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.129
- THAT'S WHERE HE'S FROM.

33:50.162 --> 33:51.797
- CALL WAS TO JAMES PELL.

33:51.830 --> 33:56.068
- RAND'S GENERAL COUNSEL.

33:56.102 --> 33:59.271
VIRGINIA PELL.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.707
WHERE DOES SHE LIVE?
- UPPER EAST, BUT...

34:01.740 --> 34:03.475
- I GOT A D.O.B. HERE.

34:03.509 --> 34:07.779
THE GUY IS 70 YEARS OLD.
SO...VIRGINIA'S DAD?

34:11.350 --> 34:13.385
- MS. PELL.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.386
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT
FOR US?

34:14.420 --> 34:16.622
- I'M WITH MY FATHER.
YOU CAN TRY ME AT WORK.

34:16.655 --> 34:19.258
- YOU MIGHT NOT WANT
TO DISCUSS THIS AT THE OFFICE.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.659
GEORGE COLEMAN IS DEAD.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.696
- YES, I KNOW.
I'M ARRANGING THE FUNERAL.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.499
AND HE'D STILL BE ALIVE
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU PEOPLE

34:27.533 --> 34:29.501
PUTTING HIM ON THE SPOT.

34:29.535 --> 34:32.438
- WHY?
YOU THINK HE WAS MURDERED?

34:32.471 --> 34:34.306
- GEORGIE DRANK
ON A GOOD DAY.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.142
AND IF HE WAS UNDER PRESSURE--

34:36.175 --> 34:37.143
- THERE WAS NO ALCOHOL
IN HIS ROOM

34:37.176 --> 34:39.711
WHEN WE LEFT, VIRGINIA.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.447
A FEW HOURS LATER,

34:41.480 --> 34:44.850
THERE WAS FIVE TIMES
THE LEGAL LIMIT IN HIS SYSTEM.

34:47.186 --> 34:50.222
- EXCUSE ME.
MY FATHER NEEDS HIS MEDS.

34:52.824 --> 34:57.863
- OKAY, THAT SHOULD START
SOME CHATTER.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.132
- FIVE TIMES
THE LEGAL THE LIMIT, WILLIAM?

35:00.166 --> 35:02.301
I THOUGHT THE PLAN
WAS JUST TO TALK TO HIM.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.203
- I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS.
I'M IN A MEETING.

35:04.236 --> 35:06.538
- OKAY, BUT NOW THEY'RE GONNA BE
ALL OVER US.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.507
DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE A RUN
OUT TO THE MOUNTAIN?

35:08.540 --> 35:10.609
- I'LL SPEAK TO JOE AT THE
FUNERAL, HE'LL MAKE THE HIKE.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.578
BUT, BABY,
LET'S NOT TALK BUSINESS

35:12.611 --> 35:15.481
ON THIS LINE, ALL RIGHT?
- SORRY.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.416
I GUESS I GOT
A LITTLE RATTLED.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.418
