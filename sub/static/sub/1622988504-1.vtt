01:16.433 --> 01:19.569
(wind whooshing)

01:28.545 --> 01:31.381
(heavy breathing)

01:38.622 --> 01:40.423
- (growling)
- (gasps)

01:47.697 --> 01:49.432
(crying)

01:50.567 --> 01:52.435
- (growling)
- (gasps)

01:53.403 --> 01:55.139
- (louder growling)
- (shrieks)

01:59.709 --> 02:00.744
(grunts)

02:02.746 --> 02:04.648
(screams)

02:05.883 --> 02:06.918
Enid: Hang on.

02:07.885 --> 02:09.452
(tape rewinds)

02:17.995 --> 02:19.629
(woman whimpering on TV)

02:22.432 --> 02:27.939
(screams)

02:33.844 --> 02:35.012
(door opens)

02:35.545 --> 02:38.015
(footsteps)

02:39.984 --> 02:41.919
Not still going over it?

02:42.053 --> 02:44.922
Well, if we're passing it
as an 18, it needs more cuts.

02:45.555 --> 02:47.258
The decapitation?

02:47.391 --> 02:50.660
Nope. No, the decapitation
is ridiculous.

02:51.429 --> 02:53.064
It's the, er,
it's the eye gouging...

02:53.197 --> 02:55.366
it's too, it's too realistic.

02:55.498 --> 02:58.102
Plus, I was trying to see
who dragged her away.

02:58.535 --> 03:00.104
Sanderson: Does it matter?

03:02.073 --> 03:04.175
Well, would be nice if it has some
clear retribution after all the...

03:04.241 --> 03:07.411
I appreciate you analyzing this
with such precision, Enid,

03:07.544 --> 03:09.413
but perhaps someone
got out of the cautious side

03:09.479 --> 03:10.580
of bed this morning?

03:10.714 --> 03:12.515
Well, I'm just doing my job.

03:12.649 --> 03:14.185
Sanderson: You're missing
the intellectual layer,

03:14.251 --> 03:15.953
- my dear.
- Oh, come on, we both saw how...

03:16.020 --> 03:17.487
The heightened references
take the edge off

03:17.554 --> 03:19.056
the more realistic violence.

03:19.323 --> 03:23.727
See it less as an eye gouging,
more part of a grand tradition.

03:23.861 --> 03:26.030
It's no worse
than the Cyclops in Homer.

03:26.163 --> 03:28.165
It's Gloucester in <i>Lear.</i>

03:28.299 --> 03:31.035
It's... <i>Un Chien Andalou.</i>

03:35.672 --> 03:38.809
I've salvaged the tug of war
with the intestines.

03:38.943 --> 03:41.846
I've kept in most
of the screwdriver stuff.

03:42.512 --> 03:45.816
And I've only trimmed
the tiniest bit

03:45.883 --> 03:47.584
off the end of the genitals.

03:48.919 --> 03:51.654
But some things should be left
to the imagination.

03:52.423 --> 03:54.158
It's like <i>Rat Brothel</i>
all over again.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.792
No, I just want to get it right.

03:57.328 --> 03:59.263
Plus, you lost the argument
the moment you brought

03:59.330 --> 04:00.597
Shakespeare into the room.

04:01.499 --> 04:02.433
(sighs)

04:02.766 --> 04:05.036
We can't afford
to make mistakes.

04:05.602 --> 04:07.004
I'm cutting it.

04:10.341 --> 04:13.144
News presenter: <i>As Britain is
invaded by a wave of depraved</i>

04:13.210 --> 04:14.912
<i>and corrupt horror videos,</i>

04:15.046 --> 04:17.248
<i>prosecutions of distributors
of the video nasties...</i>

04:17.314 --> 04:19.416
Reporter 1: <i>What we're talking
about are videos that depict</i>

04:19.483 --> 04:21.584
<i>butchering, sadism, murder.</i>

04:21.718 --> 04:23.454
<i>This is dangerous
and hardcore stuff.</i>

04:23.586 --> 04:25.022
News presenter: <i>And Britain's
rising crime</i>

04:25.156 --> 04:26.457
<i>with one conservative MP</i>

04:26.524 --> 04:27.992
<i>stating that these
violent films</i>

04:28.125 --> 04:30.294
<i>are gnawing
at society's moral fabric.</i>

04:30.428 --> 04:33.563
Reporter 2: <i>Violence is an
inherent part of human nature</i>

04:33.696 --> 04:35.499
<i>and it's important
that we find</i>

04:35.565 --> 04:37.034
<i>a cathartic outlet for this</i>

04:37.134 --> 04:39.937
<i>otherwise, it remains pent up,
uncontrolled.</i>

04:40.004 --> 04:41.505
Reporter 3: <i>I even heard
from one social worker,</i>

04:41.638 --> 04:43.874
<i>who at 5.30 in the morning
visiting a family,</i>

04:44.008 --> 04:46.110
<i>he wasn't allowed
to start his visit</i>

04:46.243 --> 04:47.244
<i>until the rape scene</i>

04:47.311 --> 04:49.113
<i>from</i> I Spit On Your Grave
<i>had been finished...</i>

04:49.180 --> 04:50.780
Reporter 4: <i>Far too many
violent images,</i>

04:50.915 --> 04:52.550
<i>which are penetrating
the minds</i>

04:52.615 --> 04:53.551
<i>of impressionable
young children.</i>

04:53.683 --> 04:54.819
Reporter 5:
<i>There's a real danger</i>

04:54.885 --> 04:56.753
<i>of confusing fiction
with reality.</i>

04:56.821 --> 04:58.755
News presenter: <i>The raids
up and down the country,</i>

04:58.889 --> 05:01.959
<i>Trading Standards have seized
over four thousand films</i>

05:02.059 --> 05:02.860
<i>from video shops</i>

05:02.927 --> 05:04.161
<i>as well as from private homes.</i>

05:04.228 --> 05:05.362
Mary: <i>If this film stays</i>

05:05.429 --> 05:06.729
<i>in your mind...</i>

05:07.398 --> 05:08.798
<i>its presence is corrupting.</i>

05:08.999 --> 05:11.068
Reporter 6:
<i>These increasingly sadistic</i>

05:11.135 --> 05:13.037
<i>and violent films
are being watched</i>

05:13.170 --> 05:15.705
<i>and rewatched over
and over again.</i>

05:15.840 --> 05:17.241
<i>Viewers are like drug addicts</i>

05:17.374 --> 05:19.910
<i>wanting stronger
and harder films every time.</i>

05:20.044 --> 05:21.078
Reporter 7:
<i>There's clear evidence</i>

05:21.378 --> 05:23.047
<i>that these films are lowering
standards in society.</i>

05:23.214 --> 05:25.182
<i>And we should be afraid what
else they might do to people...</i>

05:25.282 --> 05:27.051
News presenter 2: <i>With more
video recorders per person</i>

05:27.118 --> 05:28.853
<i>than any other country
in the world,</i>

05:28.986 --> 05:31.822
<i>Britain is the leader
of the video revolution.</i>

05:32.556 --> 05:34.558
- (creature growls)
- (woman screams)

05:34.691 --> 05:37.694
(dramatic music playing)

05:54.677 --> 05:56.646
(muffled whimpering from TV)

06:05.256 --> 06:07.057
(man sobs)

06:11.595 --> 06:12.496
(screams)

06:12.630 --> 06:14.131
Enid: This depiction
is dangerous.

06:14.265 --> 06:16.267
Come on, Enid.
No one's gonna pick this up

06:16.400 --> 06:18.068
and think it's a documentary.
It's so fake.

06:18.202 --> 06:20.271
To you it might be sausages
for intestines,

06:20.404 --> 06:22.606
- but what if it gets into the hands of children?
- Exactly!

06:22.739 --> 06:25.276
Kids could be rewinding
and watching those scenes

06:25.342 --> 06:26.709
over and over again.

06:26.776 --> 06:28.479
Which is exactly
what new government guidelines

06:28.612 --> 06:29.613
are pointing at.

06:30.247 --> 06:31.949
- Video technology is changing the rules...
- More guidelines. Great.

06:31.949 --> 06:33.584
Not as if we haven't got enough
on our hands.

06:33.651 --> 06:34.919
Sanderson: How can we do
our job properly

06:35.085 --> 06:37.621
if we're constantly bogged down
by government bureaucracy?

06:37.754 --> 06:39.390
If it's the nation's sanity
they're worried about,

06:39.490 --> 06:40.424
why don't they stop slashing

06:40.690 --> 06:42.059
- social services?
- Fraser: Okay, I get it.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.727
But I'm afraid we're not here
to debate the government.

06:44.828 --> 06:47.298
Can we get back on track,
please?

06:48.632 --> 06:51.202
Consensus on <i>Cannibal Carnage?</i>

06:51.302 --> 06:53.270
- Reject.
- I agree.

06:53.437 --> 06:54.805
A few cuts.

06:55.372 --> 06:56.773
I'd pass it.

06:59.577 --> 07:00.710
Enid.

07:01.778 --> 07:03.380
(screams loudly)

07:03.514 --> 07:05.916
So, we're both
recommending reject?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.017
Yes.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.787
Can I be a massive pain
and get you to type up my notes?

07:11.788 --> 07:13.657
Of course.
No problem, Anne.

07:13.790 --> 07:15.492
Anne: It's my sister's birthday.

07:15.626 --> 07:17.895
I should have been there
half an hour ago.

07:19.997 --> 07:21.365
Are you sure that's okay?

07:23.434 --> 07:24.668
You should go.

07:24.802 --> 07:26.337
Anne: Thanks, Enid.

07:26.470 --> 07:27.737
See you tomorrow.

07:32.409 --> 07:33.944
(distant screams)

07:34.812 --> 07:36.814
(typewriter keys clicking)

08:06.543 --> 08:08.979
(woman's laughter echoes)

08:09.046 --> 08:10.214
Woman 1: I can't believe
you did, though.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.982
- You are nuts.
- Woman 2: Oh my God!

08:12.049 --> 08:14.618
- Woman 1: Love you so much.
- Woman 2: Oh, I love you more.

08:14.685 --> 08:16.186
(both giggling)

08:28.565 --> 08:29.500
Excuse me!

08:34.337 --> 08:35.371
Sorry, excuse me!

08:39.409 --> 08:41.879
Er, sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

08:50.421 --> 08:52.022
(clamoring)

08:55.459 --> 08:57.995
Margaret Thatcher: <i>What we
have seen in this country</i>

08:58.128 --> 09:00.798
<i>is the emergence
of an organized</i>

09:00.864 --> 09:03.000
<i>revolutionary minority,</i>

09:03.600 --> 09:07.104
<i>who are prepared
to exploit industrial disputes</i>

09:07.571 --> 09:09.239
<i>but whose real aim</i>

09:09.306 --> 09:11.875
<i>is the breakdown
of law and order</i>

09:12.009 --> 09:14.044
<i>and the destruction
of democratic</i>

09:14.111 --> 09:15.814
<i>parliamentary government.</i>

09:16.046 --> 09:18.315
(crowd applauding on TV)

09:19.283 --> 09:21.318
News presenter:
<i>The gas industry's main unions</i>

09:21.385 --> 09:22.152
<i>have today announced</i>

09:22.286 --> 09:24.021
<i>that they will delay
their decision</i>

09:24.154 --> 09:27.424
<i>regarding any industrial action
to assist the miners...</i>

09:27.558 --> 09:29.426
(inhales)

09:29.560 --> 09:31.195
(phone rings)

09:31.261 --> 09:33.263
<i>...were set to take place
later this week,</i>

09:33.364 --> 09:35.499
<i>which have now been postponed
indefinitely.</i>

09:35.599 --> 09:36.800
(phone continues ringing)

09:37.601 --> 09:39.470
Enid: (over answering machine)
<i>This is Enid Baines.</i>

09:39.536 --> 09:40.738
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

09:40.871 --> 09:42.172
(beep)

09:42.807 --> 09:45.409
June: (over speaker)
<i>Hi Enid. It's Mom.</i>

09:45.976 --> 09:48.412
<i>Oh, I don't like talking
to these things.</i>

09:48.979 --> 09:51.315
<i>Well, if you're there,
Dad and I booked the table</i>

09:51.382 --> 09:52.616
<i>for 9 p.m.</i>

09:53.083 --> 09:55.285
<i>It's at the restaurant
that Dad mentioned.</i>

09:55.919 --> 09:58.322
<i>Er, see you there, love. Bye.</i>

09:58.455 --> 09:59.957
(beep fading away)

10:00.190 --> 10:02.192
(quiet indistinct chatter)

10:06.730 --> 10:08.465
The food here is meant
to be good.

10:08.599 --> 10:10.000
Mm.

10:12.736 --> 10:14.405
This is a death certificate.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.540
Waitress: Ready to order?

10:19.910 --> 10:21.412
Maybe we need another minute.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.449
Have they found something?

10:25.582 --> 10:26.917
No, Enid.

10:27.484 --> 10:29.219
We just felt...

10:31.288 --> 10:32.523
What's going on?

10:34.358 --> 10:35.959
Your Dad and I
have been thinking about this

10:36.026 --> 10:37.327
for a long time.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.197
It hasn't been an easy decision.

10:40.899 --> 10:42.332
Enid, I know it's difficult,

10:42.466 --> 10:44.501
but we need to find
a way to let go.

10:45.904 --> 10:46.838
Let go?

10:47.337 --> 10:49.540
June: Try to find
some sort of peace?

10:51.408 --> 10:54.011
Your Dad and I aren't
going to be around forever

10:54.144 --> 10:55.814
and I don't want
to grow old wishing

10:55.880 --> 10:56.815
for a happy ending

10:56.881 --> 10:58.982
that we all know
might never come.

11:00.417 --> 11:03.287
So, are you deciding
that she's dead?

11:08.827 --> 11:10.994
But this marks her death
as that day.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.530
I was there.
I would know if she died.

11:13.597 --> 11:17.267
You've never been clear
on exactly what you remember.

11:18.335 --> 11:20.437
I can try and remember, Mom.
Is that what you want me to do?

11:20.504 --> 11:22.105
- I can, you know...
- Enid, we've done that.

11:22.172 --> 11:23.507
That's the point.

11:24.274 --> 11:25.275
We'll never know what happened.

11:25.409 --> 11:26.845
Yeah, so she's still missing.

11:26.977 --> 11:30.481
Enid, if we were going to...

11:31.181 --> 11:32.382
we should have found her by now.

11:32.516 --> 11:35.686
You know if someone
did take her, then...

11:36.821 --> 11:38.455
then they're still out there.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.993
Enid.

11:46.363 --> 11:47.397
Sorry.

11:50.033 --> 11:51.568
We're not blaming you.

11:53.136 --> 11:56.273
Mom and I are only trying to do
what's best, love.

11:56.406 --> 11:59.076
June: It's the right decision
for all of us, Enid.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.278
Please?

12:13.223 --> 12:15.425
No,
that's a copy for you to keep.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.565
- (inhales anxiously)
- George: Patrick recommended

12:21.632 --> 12:22.666
the fish.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.135
Viv said they had
a lovely time here.

12:25.269 --> 12:26.770
- Mm.
- (chuckles)

12:29.540 --> 12:31.141
So, how's work, Enid?

12:31.809 --> 12:33.577
Seen anything you'd recommend?

12:35.847 --> 12:37.447
It's not entertainment, Mom.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.651
I do it to protect people.

12:40.784 --> 12:41.618
June: Yes, of course. Well,

12:41.718 --> 12:44.721
let's all just try
to have a lovely meal.

12:44.856 --> 12:46.256
Shall we?

13:07.578 --> 13:09.446
(thunder rumbles)

13:29.132 --> 13:30.667
(inhales)

14:08.973 --> 14:10.741
(sighs)

14:11.675 --> 14:13.143
(muffled noise)

14:14.745 --> 14:16.546
- Woman: It's always the same with you.
- Man: What?

14:16.647 --> 14:18.148
Woman: You know,
taking no responsibility.

14:18.215 --> 14:19.750
Man:
I never take responsibility?

14:19.817 --> 14:20.717
What, you lose your fucking job

14:20.885 --> 14:22.552
and I'm the one that
doesn't take responsibility?

14:22.686 --> 14:24.388
(quietly) I've had
enough of this shit!

14:24.521 --> 14:25.555
Man: Fucking kid to feed.

14:25.722 --> 14:27.290
Woman: (quietly)
Don't be bringing him into it.

14:27.357 --> 14:29.192
Man: It's fucking typical.

14:49.947 --> 14:51.916
(inhales deeply)

14:56.154 --> 14:57.220
Late night?

14:57.354 --> 14:59.123
One too many white wines.

14:59.256 --> 15:02.492
Well, let's hope there's nothing
too stomach churning coming up then.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.463
What masterpiece
are we dissecting?

15:06.596 --> 15:08.298
<i>Extreme Coda.</i>

15:08.799 --> 15:10.300
(Anne chuckles)

15:12.937 --> 15:14.638
(tape starts playing)

15:14.771 --> 15:16.373
(grunting)

15:18.176 --> 15:19.944
(woman whimpers)

15:22.546 --> 15:24.781
- (woman screams)
- (man grunts)

15:26.017 --> 15:28.218
(struggle continues)

15:29.753 --> 15:31.688
- (man moans)
- (rhythmic thumping)

15:33.191 --> 15:34.791
(woman continues screaming)

15:36.393 --> 15:38.395
Anne: I mean, what is it
with these directors?

15:38.528 --> 15:41.264
Male inadequacy
revenge catharsis.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.804
Didn't that get to you?

15:47.604 --> 15:49.974
Some of those scenes
were so excessive.

15:50.108 --> 15:51.775
Just focus on getting it right.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.879
Don't really think
about anything else.

15:59.884 --> 16:01.251
Plus, I haven't got a hangover.

16:01.318 --> 16:02.285
(Anne chuckles)

16:02.619 --> 16:05.857
Enid, Fraser wants to see us.
Says it's urgent.

16:23.908 --> 16:25.575
Fraser: Shut the door.

16:34.986 --> 16:37.554
You two passed <i>Deranged,</i>
right?

16:38.256 --> 16:40.858
- <i>Deranged?</i>
- Yes. The Moreno film.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.394
We watched it
a few months ago. Why?

16:45.062 --> 16:49.834
There's a, a sequence in it
where a man eats someone's face.

16:50.234 --> 16:54.571
- Oh, yes.
- Yes. 18 with extensive cuts.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.909
What's happened, Fraser?

16:59.676 --> 17:03.080
A man that was arrested
in Brighouse yesterday.

17:03.214 --> 17:04.848
He, er...

17:05.615 --> 17:07.517
killed his wife, then he,...

17:08.318 --> 17:10.253
then he tore off
and ate her face.

17:10.954 --> 17:14.992
W... went on to shoot
his two children, dead.

17:15.724 --> 17:16.792
It's horrific.

17:17.295 --> 17:19.396
I got a call from some

17:19.596 --> 17:21.999
journalist 15 minutes ago
who was breaking the story.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.304
He's linking the killings
directly to <i>Deranged.</i>

17:26.502 --> 17:29.339
Oh God! So, they're blaming us?

17:29.506 --> 17:31.508
Well, there's the thing.

17:32.143 --> 17:34.245
This journalist seemed to know
that it was you two

17:34.312 --> 17:35.980
who passed the film.

17:36.147 --> 17:37.380
How the hell do they know that?

17:37.514 --> 17:39.482
I can't believe you two
let it get past you.

17:39.616 --> 17:41.618
It's complete hysteria.

17:41.986 --> 17:44.454
It's no worse than other
material we've passed.

17:44.588 --> 17:46.356
Fraser: The press
are going to town

17:46.489 --> 17:48.725
calling him
the 'Amnesiac Killer'.

17:50.328 --> 17:53.331
He's saying he can't remember
what happened.

17:54.065 --> 17:56.033
Government policy's
already breathing down

17:56.100 --> 17:57.667
our necks without this.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.603
It's a complete disaster.

17:59.736 --> 18:01.172
I mean, I can't believe
you'd go off

18:01.272 --> 18:03.540
like that without permission,
either of you... (voice fades)

18:03.908 --> 18:05.009
(chimes)

18:05.142 --> 18:07.711
Man: (muffled) Why did you
leave her in the forest?

18:12.449 --> 18:14.085
Fraser: Enid, how?

18:14.718 --> 18:15.853
Sorry.

18:17.955 --> 18:19.090
I'm so sorry.

18:22.159 --> 18:25.695
I need you to walk me
through your decisions again.

18:26.030 --> 18:28.565
So, I'm 100% clear.

18:28.698 --> 18:31.401
And for the record, in future,

18:31.534 --> 18:33.905
if you have even
the slightest doubt...

18:34.571 --> 18:36.506
just reject the film.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.410
News reader: <i>The man,
who went berserk</i>

18:40.543 --> 18:43.314
<i>claims he cannot recall
the incident at all.</i>

18:43.446 --> 18:45.349
<i>The accused
has been dubbed by press</i>

18:45.415 --> 18:46.951
<i>as 'The Amnesiac Killer'</i>

18:47.084 --> 18:49.653
<i>after links being made today
between the killing</i>

18:49.786 --> 18:53.090
<i>and video nasty horror film,</i>
Deranged.

18:53.224 --> 18:55.492
Neighbor: (over TV) <i>I heard
the most awful scream.</i>

18:55.993 --> 18:57.661
<i>Made my blood go cold.</i>

18:57.794 --> 19:00.131
<i>And now they're saying
it's because of some film.</i>

19:00.865 --> 19:02.565
<i>Looks like the world's
gone mad.</i>

19:02.699 --> 19:04.168
<i>This has always been
a really safe neighborhood,</i>

19:04.335 --> 19:07.872
- <i>like, for the kids and that. For everyone...</i>
- (phone rings)

19:08.538 --> 19:11.008
News reader: <i>A hotel
in Painswick has been cleared</i>

19:11.075 --> 19:12.376
<i>of staff and guests</i>

19:12.509 --> 19:14.477
<i>after police found
what could be a bomb</i>

19:14.611 --> 19:16.613
<i>hidden in one
of the hotel's rooms.</i>

19:17.048 --> 19:19.317
- Mom?
- Caller: <i>Despicable woman.</i>

19:19.449 --> 19:21.518
<i>Letting people see
that disgusting film,</i>

19:21.651 --> 19:23.586
<i>you should be
ashamed of yourself.</i>

19:25.289 --> 19:26.824
(phone rings)

19:30.161 --> 19:31.162
(muffled sobbing)

19:36.067 --> 19:37.301
George: Enid!

19:37.435 --> 19:38.803
Where is she?

19:40.871 --> 19:41.906
Enid!

19:43.274 --> 19:47.111
June: (crying) No! No!

20:07.465 --> 20:08.798
Man: Oi, watch it, mate!

20:08.866 --> 20:10.201
- Journalist 1: Miss Baines!
- Journalist 2: Enid,

20:10.267 --> 20:11.668
why did you allow
<i>Deranged</i> to be released?

20:11.869 --> 20:13.270
Journalist 3: Do you feel
you have blood on your hands?

20:13.337 --> 20:14.972
Journalist 2: Is the Amnesiac
Killer telling the truth?

20:15.039 --> 20:16.874
Journalist 4: Why aren't
you banning these films?

20:32.923 --> 20:34.724
(keys clicking)

20:46.536 --> 20:48.239
- (knock on door)
- Fraser: Come in.

20:49.672 --> 20:52.143
Doug: Fraser,
you sly old bastard.

20:52.276 --> 20:53.344
Fraser: Doug, hi. Come in.

20:53.477 --> 20:55.545
(paper rustles)

20:58.382 --> 21:00.084
(indistinct chatter)

21:04.989 --> 21:07.557
Sanderson: (muffled) I mean,
my kids are reading this.

21:07.690 --> 21:09.160
How the fuck do they know
who passed it?

21:09.293 --> 21:11.661
- You think she blabbed to the press?
- Gordon: Oh, yeah.

21:11.795 --> 21:14.231
Sanderson: It's not even
like we're paid that much.

21:14.365 --> 21:16.800
I could go to academia
like that. (snaps fingers)

21:16.934 --> 21:20.603
Seriously. And that,
that scene is laughable!

21:20.737 --> 21:22.406
Even Little-Miss-Perfect
thought it was funny.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.141
(Gordon laughs)

21:25.509 --> 21:26.776
Enid.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.717
Bad luck, isn't it?

21:35.618 --> 21:37.720
I mean, it could have happened
to any of us.

21:39.356 --> 21:43.227
If I'm here to make decisions
it can't be 'bad luck'.

21:45.529 --> 21:47.832
Gordon: No. But, well,

21:48.332 --> 21:49.632
you know what I mean.

21:50.234 --> 21:51.601
We all make mistakes.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.816
Young Enid: <i>Nina, spin.</i>

22:06.283 --> 22:10.653
<i>One, two, three.</i>

22:12.490 --> 22:13.623
(Doug laughs)

22:13.690 --> 22:15.092
That's a single malt now,
Fraser.

22:15.226 --> 22:17.428
- Don't be using that to drown your sorrows.
- Er, yeah.

22:17.561 --> 22:19.363
(laughs)

22:21.098 --> 22:22.933
And who's this
you've got squirreled away?

22:23.067 --> 22:26.137
Er, this is Enid Baines.
She's one of our censors.

22:26.270 --> 22:27.704
So, this is Enid.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.141
- Have we met?
- No.

22:31.741 --> 22:35.846
Doug Smart. Producer,
Ident Investment Films.

22:40.451 --> 22:43.720
Fraser, you didn't tell me
you had such a photogenic team.

22:44.687 --> 22:46.323
Now tell me this Enid,
if you get bored

22:46.390 --> 22:47.657
of banning my films,

22:47.790 --> 22:50.327
I'm sure I could get you a job
on the big screen.

22:50.861 --> 22:53.663
I'm not sure how much
I like the idea of being raped

22:53.796 --> 22:55.466
and cut into pieces on camera.

22:55.599 --> 22:57.034
(chuckles)

22:57.168 --> 23:00.070
No, but I'm sure
the public would love it.

23:00.571 --> 23:01.771
Fraser: Okay, Doug, come on.

23:01.906 --> 23:03.673
Maybe Enid could, er,

23:03.740 --> 23:06.610
watch my latest
Frederick North submission?

23:07.178 --> 23:09.580
It's from the archives.
It's harmless, I promise.

23:09.980 --> 23:12.917
I, er...
I'm sure you could slip me a 15.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.718
Fraser: It's, er,
already on her schedule.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.421
And I'm sure
she'll deal with it

23:17.488 --> 23:18.788
with her usual professionalism.

23:18.923 --> 23:21.258
Right, come on, Doug.
Let me see you out.

23:22.293 --> 23:23.827
<i>Enchante, mademoiselle.</i>

23:26.030 --> 23:29.567
What a wee cracker she is.
Absolutely gorgeous.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.168
(typewriters clicking)

23:36.140 --> 23:37.942
There were
so many shits and fucks,

23:38.075 --> 23:39.577
it was impossible
to cut them all,

23:39.709 --> 23:42.213
so we just had to give it a 15.

23:43.314 --> 23:44.481
Anyway...

23:45.883 --> 23:47.384
- Thank you, Alf.
- Alf: All right.

23:47.518 --> 23:49.353
What have we got now then?
(sighs)

23:49.486 --> 23:50.921
<i>Don't Go In The Church.</i>

23:51.055 --> 23:53.357
There won't be many places
left for us to go soon.

23:53.958 --> 23:55.226
(laughs)

23:56.293 --> 23:57.760
Frederick North film.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.331
Haven't seen
one of his in a while.

24:00.464 --> 24:02.266
Used to be quite prolific.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.500
Don't think I know his work.

24:03.634 --> 24:05.903
Oh, he's a laugh a minute.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.121
Oh, silent titles.

24:25.022 --> 24:26.257
Unusual.

24:33.330 --> 24:34.298
Girl 1: <i>This way.</i>

24:34.932 --> 24:36.367
Girl 2: <i>Please stop.</i>

24:36.600 --> 24:39.103
<i>I don't like it.
Can we go back?</i>

24:39.769 --> 24:41.472
Girl 1: <i>No, it'll be fun.</i>

24:47.244 --> 24:48.946
<i>Let's play a game.</i>

24:50.481 --> 24:52.983
(inaudible whispering)

25:00.824 --> 25:02.226
<i>Come on.</i>

25:02.693 --> 25:04.328
<i>Summon my shadow.</i>

25:05.195 --> 25:06.263
<i>Spin.</i>

25:10.934 --> 25:12.136
(clears throat)

25:12.403 --> 25:13.570
Girl 1: <i>Do it!</i>

25:17.775 --> 25:19.209
<i>One...</i>

25:21.145 --> 25:23.113
<i>Two...</i>

25:25.182 --> 25:27.017
<i>Three...</i>

25:32.056 --> 25:33.257
<i>Go on.</i>

25:35.292 --> 25:36.460
<i>In there.</i>

25:38.262 --> 25:39.263
<i>Go!</i>

25:56.513 --> 25:59.483
(breathes anxiously)

26:05.689 --> 26:07.391
(chimes)

26:12.930 --> 26:14.131
(inhales)

26:24.475 --> 26:25.576
(wood creaks)

26:30.547 --> 26:32.416
(screams)

26:32.549 --> 26:34.017
(loud thud of chopping)

26:34.819 --> 26:36.120
(squelching)

26:41.058 --> 26:42.359
(chopping continues)

26:50.901 --> 26:52.169
- (grunts)
- (squelching)

26:57.074 --> 26:59.042
(chopping continues)

27:05.482 --> 27:06.950
(gasps)

27:19.363 --> 27:20.464
(inhales sharply)

27:20.731 --> 27:22.433
(growls)

27:22.933 --> 27:25.602
(breathes heavily)

27:30.240 --> 27:32.276
(coughs)

27:34.945 --> 27:37.314
(breathes heavily)

27:42.653 --> 27:44.121
Perkins: You okay?

27:44.823 --> 27:46.390
It was quite full on.

27:47.558 --> 27:48.959
It shook me up.

27:49.092 --> 27:50.727
Just feeling a bit
under the weather.

27:51.930 --> 27:54.264
You know you can always talk
to me, don't you?

27:55.365 --> 27:56.633
If you want to.

27:57.468 --> 27:58.769
Stressful times.

27:59.236 --> 28:01.672
Like when my mom passed away,

28:01.738 --> 28:03.040
if I hadn't had
someone to talk to

28:03.106 --> 28:05.042
I think I might of just...

28:05.742 --> 28:07.077
I don't know,

28:07.211 --> 28:09.313
- lost it...
- Why do you think he can't remember?

28:11.248 --> 28:12.616
Er, who?

28:14.985 --> 28:17.020
The Amnesiac Killer.

28:17.956 --> 28:20.524
Oh, I... I don't know.

28:23.794 --> 28:25.562
I mean,
why wouldn't he remember?

28:28.532 --> 28:30.133
God, it's hard to...

28:31.702 --> 28:33.270
Could be basic trauma.

28:33.403 --> 28:36.206
Brain sort of shuts it out.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.710
Could have had a bang
on the head even. Or...

28:41.311 --> 28:43.780
It makes me think
of my psychotherapy days

28:43.915 --> 28:45.749
we'd talk about
how people construct

28:45.817 --> 28:47.718
stories to cope.

28:48.619 --> 28:50.654
You'd be surprised
what the human brain

28:50.721 --> 28:53.524
can edit out
when it can't handle the truth.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.028
Look.

28:58.997 --> 29:00.764
You're good at your job, Enid.

29:01.265 --> 29:03.600
Don't let what's going on
out there get to you.

29:06.670 --> 29:09.706
I don't know if you want to
but maybe we could get out

29:09.773 --> 29:10.808
of here sometime?

29:12.042 --> 29:13.544
Go for a drink.

29:20.284 --> 29:22.753
I'm so sorry about your mom,
Perkins.

29:25.756 --> 29:27.224
Thank you for this.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.833
(footsteps echoes)

29:44.909 --> 29:47.544
(distant sobbing)

29:55.019 --> 29:56.219
Hello?

30:02.827 --> 30:04.595
(whimper)

30:08.866 --> 30:09.834
Hello?

30:27.217 --> 30:29.386
(footsteps)

30:40.764 --> 30:42.366
June: (over phone)
<i>Hello?</i>

30:43.600 --> 30:44.801
Enid: Hi, Mom.

30:45.937 --> 30:50.273
June:
<i>Oh, Enid. Are you okay?</i>

30:51.475 --> 30:53.377
<i>I've been trying
to get hold of you.</i>

30:54.012 --> 30:56.213
Sorry. Work's been...

30:58.615 --> 31:00.317
really busy.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.753
June: <i>Oh, okay.</i>

31:03.353 --> 31:05.222
<i>Well, I hope
you're all right, love.</i>

31:10.494 --> 31:12.229
<i>Are you still there, love?</i>

31:14.899 --> 31:15.833
Yes.

31:21.238 --> 31:22.539
It's, um...

31:25.275 --> 31:27.611
I examined this film today.

31:29.546 --> 31:32.449
June:
<i>Oh. What was it about?</i>

31:41.859 --> 31:42.927
Nothing.

31:44.628 --> 31:45.696
It doesn't matter.

31:49.433 --> 31:54.404
June: <i>You... you mustn't
let work get you down, Enid.</i>

31:55.139 --> 31:56.273
<i>I saw the news.</i>

31:56.740 --> 31:58.375
- <i>It's only 'cause your Dad...</i>
- Dad doesn't know

31:58.442 --> 31:59.576
what he's talking about.

31:59.643 --> 32:01.712
- June: <i>All right, love.</i>
- I'm sorry.

32:05.049 --> 32:06.416
Just tired.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.253
June: <i>Well, don't overdo it,
will you?</i>

32:11.755 --> 32:14.291
<i>You can't be responsible
for everyone, Enid.</i>

32:15.026 --> 32:16.693
<i>It's just a job.</i>

32:17.260 --> 32:18.963
Yeah. I suppose so.

32:21.833 --> 32:23.667
(TV playing in the distance)

32:30.707 --> 32:34.846
- (beep)
- (static)

32:51.028 --> 32:52.629
(static continues)

33:01.973 --> 33:04.608
(heavy breathing)

33:11.215 --> 33:13.851
(ominous music playing)

33:43.181 --> 33:44.681
(static continues)

34:01.798 --> 34:03.100
(chimes)

34:08.072 --> 34:09.672
Nina?

34:13.443 --> 34:14.846
(wind whistles)

34:16.346 --> 34:17.849
Nina?

34:19.349 --> 34:21.484
(growling)

34:28.926 --> 34:30.427
(growling)

34:38.435 --> 34:40.570
(tense music playing)

35:00.624 --> 35:04.494
(moaning and crying)

35:12.937 --> 35:14.005
Mom?

35:26.017 --> 35:28.485
It's all your fault!

35:28.585 --> 35:31.488
(upbeat cartoon music over TV)

35:31.989 --> 35:33.456
(creaking)

35:34.825 --> 35:36.726
(meows)

35:39.297 --> 35:40.463
(sighs)

35:44.335 --> 35:47.671
(muffled whimpers)

35:47.838 --> 35:48.806
Valerie.

35:49.173 --> 35:50.774
Hang on.

35:51.675 --> 35:53.677
(typing)

35:56.080 --> 35:57.181
What is it?

35:57.315 --> 35:59.183
Um, Perkins and I examined

35:59.250 --> 36:01.551
<i>Don't Go In The Church</i>
yesterday.

36:01.886 --> 36:04.055
Well, the file's a bit thin
on information.

36:05.022 --> 36:06.489
I was wondering
if you had anything else

36:06.556 --> 36:07.724
on the director.

36:09.093 --> 36:10.560
It's Frederick North.

36:14.597 --> 36:17.534
Do you have a list of his films?

36:20.037 --> 36:20.972
No.

36:22.706 --> 36:25.843
Well, without a list,
it'll take at least a week.

36:40.790 --> 36:43.593
Leaving on time, Enid?
It's not like you.

36:44.028 --> 36:45.930
(ominous music playing)

37:02.612 --> 37:04.815
Boy:
Beastman's coming to get you!

37:04.949 --> 37:06.549
(laughs)

37:09.954 --> 37:11.222
(shop bell rings)

37:29.140 --> 37:30.707
(shop bell rings)

37:31.375 --> 37:33.210
Gerald: Oh, hi.

37:33.344 --> 37:34.744
Er, enjoy it?

37:34.879 --> 37:36.047
Customer: Yeah, proper gory.

37:36.180 --> 37:39.083
Gerald: It's good, isn't it?
See you next time.

37:39.216 --> 37:40.251
Customer: Cheers, Gerald.

37:40.384 --> 37:41.986
(shop bell rings)

37:56.500 --> 37:58.836
- Gerald: Hey.
- I thought that one was banned.

38:00.905 --> 38:02.940
Um, I don't know what you mean.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.776
Maybe you can help me?
I was looking for

38:07.211 --> 38:08.879
some of the more unusual

38:09.380 --> 38:11.215
Frederick North films?

38:13.716 --> 38:15.252
I've seen, um...

38:16.586 --> 38:18.155
<i>Don't Go In The Church.</i>

38:18.289 --> 38:19.223
Oh.

38:19.423 --> 38:22.526
Perhaps maybe you might have
something else of his

38:22.625 --> 38:24.128
under the counter.

38:26.763 --> 38:31.302
Um... I've not seen you
in here before.

38:33.404 --> 38:35.139
Just moved to the area.

38:35.772 --> 38:38.075
Someone like you doesn't
want to watch films like that.

38:40.311 --> 38:41.611
Like what?

38:45.449 --> 38:47.818
My favorite is,
er, <i>Stationery Massacre.</i>

38:48.285 --> 38:50.653
The repeated stabbing
of the man's eye with a compass

38:50.787 --> 38:52.689
then his stomach
being ripped open

38:52.755 --> 38:54.825
- with serrated scissors.
- (exhales)

38:54.992 --> 38:56.626
His guts falling out, his,
his stomach

38:56.693 --> 38:58.195
being stapled back together.

38:58.695 --> 39:00.164
(exhales)

39:00.297 --> 39:01.664
Masterpiece.

39:08.272 --> 39:10.107
All right, come on.
I've seen, I've seen

39:10.174 --> 39:12.543
that you've got
<i>Cannibal Carnage.</i>

39:12.675 --> 39:14.812
And I know that
that's been banned.

39:16.746 --> 39:18.282
Bloody hell.

39:19.083 --> 39:20.050
Okay.

39:20.951 --> 39:23.287
So many places getting,
you know, shut down.

39:23.420 --> 39:24.488
Police raids and...

39:24.622 --> 39:26.624
My mate up town
had his lot confiscated.

39:26.723 --> 39:27.657
(distant sirens)

39:27.992 --> 39:30.727
Gerald: Honestly, it's not worth
the bloody stress.

39:35.332 --> 39:38.035
Gonna get rid of it
all soon myself anyway. So...

39:40.004 --> 39:41.771
That's all I've got of North's.

39:41.839 --> 39:43.007
It's a bit of a ropey copy.

39:43.073 --> 39:44.741
Might be a bit fuzzy
in all the good bits.

39:44.875 --> 39:47.344
And, er, well, someone's
taped over the end

39:47.411 --> 39:48.913
with another film.

39:49.380 --> 39:50.814
(cassette player clicks)

39:52.749 --> 39:54.818
Alice: <i>This place gives me
a bad feeling.</i>

39:55.286 --> 39:57.955
<i>It's like something
from one of my nightmares.</i>

39:58.088 --> 39:58.889
<i>Let's go back.</i>

39:59.089 --> 40:01.825
Tom: <i>No, we've come too far
to turn back.</i>

40:04.461 --> 40:05.629
Woman: <i>Strange.</i>

40:06.063 --> 40:08.232
- Tom: <i>What is it?</i>
- Alice: <i>A book.</i>

40:08.899 --> 40:10.534
<i>There's a symbol.</i>

40:10.767 --> 40:12.536
<i>It's like some sort of portal.</i>

40:12.670 --> 40:15.172
<i>Wait, let me see.</i>

40:19.109 --> 40:20.211
<i>It's Latin.</i>

40:20.945 --> 40:22.446
<i>I can work it out.</i>

40:23.113 --> 40:25.616
"Si introibunt

40:25.683 --> 40:28.419
hoc sepulcrum, dare

40:28.485 --> 40:30.321
tibi ad infernum..."

40:30.487 --> 40:32.156
<i>Tom. Stop!</i>

40:33.257 --> 40:34.825
<i>It could be dangerous.</i>

40:35.226 --> 40:38.862
"Qui este cunum
quam reverterto."

40:39.196 --> 40:43.267
"Quis hog momento
insemperternum."

40:44.401 --> 40:48.072
"Imutata sinsintuar."

40:49.807 --> 40:51.909
<i>He's calling for me.</i>

40:56.213 --> 40:57.881
(tape whirrs)

41:00.884 --> 41:02.486
Tom: "Sinsintuar."

41:05.422 --> 41:07.157
Alice: <i>He's calling for me.</i>

41:08.392 --> 41:10.427
<i>The evil is contagious.</i>

41:12.730 --> 41:14.398
(tape whirrs)

41:16.567 --> 41:18.435
Alice: <i>He's calling for me.</i>

41:19.703 --> 41:21.338
<i>The evil is contagious.</i>

41:25.042 --> 41:27.278
(ominous music playing)

41:59.276 --> 42:00.878
(tape whirrs)

42:02.913 --> 42:05.582
(Alice screaming)

42:12.723 --> 42:13.991
(TV clicks off)

42:15.626 --> 42:17.194
(breathes deeply)

42:31.810 --> 42:33.344
(breathes deeply)

42:46.323 --> 42:49.159
June: We definitely
had some Jaffa cakes.

42:49.493 --> 42:50.994
Sorry, I should have phoned.

42:51.161 --> 42:53.530
(tuts)
Oh, where do things end up?

42:55.265 --> 42:57.167
I should have got more bits in.

43:06.377 --> 43:08.612
Do you remember
Carol and Alan, Enid?

43:09.613 --> 43:10.514
Hm.

43:10.647 --> 43:12.449
Alan, with the squinty eye.

43:13.317 --> 43:14.651
They broke up.

43:14.853 --> 43:16.487
Such a shame.

43:17.388 --> 43:19.757
Carol's moving
near the seaside now.

43:20.057 --> 43:21.558
I suppose
she's better off out of it

43:21.625 --> 43:22.893
but I'm going to miss her.

43:23.026 --> 43:24.495
You can visit, love.

43:33.303 --> 43:35.439
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

43:36.340 --> 43:38.575
- Found a nice fella?
- No.

43:44.982 --> 43:46.950
It's to do with Nina.

43:49.319 --> 43:52.891
I know what we talked about
and I understand,

43:53.524 --> 43:54.691
but think I...

43:55.159 --> 43:57.961
I think I might have worked out
where she is.

43:58.996 --> 44:01.398
George: Oh, please, Enid.
Not this again.

44:02.466 --> 44:04.968
Enid: I know, Dad,
but this is different.

44:06.203 --> 44:07.938
There's this actress.

44:09.006 --> 44:10.941
Her name is Alice Lee.

44:13.277 --> 44:17.281
I know it sounds mad,
but I've got this...

44:18.081 --> 44:20.184
(exhales) I've got
this really strong feeling

44:20.250 --> 44:21.652
that I think it's her.

44:24.755 --> 44:28.158
I need you to look at this.
Just focus on her face.

44:28.959 --> 44:31.228
Just look at her eyes.

44:32.463 --> 44:35.632
George: We've been here before,
Enid. Every time it's not her.

44:36.099 --> 44:37.601
Dad, please!
You're not even looking at her.

44:37.668 --> 44:39.203
Please! Just look.

44:40.204 --> 44:42.539
She looks just like
the police mock-up, Dad.

44:42.874 --> 44:44.341
June: Enid, stop!

44:44.843 --> 44:46.343
- Dad.
- June: Enid.

44:46.577 --> 44:49.213
George: This is exactly
why we did what we did.

44:49.346 --> 44:50.815
We tried to do our best for you,

44:50.882 --> 44:52.616
but you go off
doing whatever you want.

44:53.016 --> 44:54.551
Just like the day
you went off with her!

44:54.618 --> 44:55.719
George!

45:32.389 --> 45:33.557
(static noise)

45:55.546 --> 45:57.147
(ominous music playing)

46:50.300 --> 46:51.501
(breathes deeply)

47:04.615 --> 47:06.383
(haunting music playing)

47:13.624 --> 47:15.225
(breathes heavily)

47:20.999 --> 47:23.166
(growling)

47:24.501 --> 47:26.570
(pants)

47:32.877 --> 47:34.645
No, Nina!

47:36.014 --> 47:38.816
(echoing) No!

47:45.056 --> 47:46.757
(ominous music plays)

47:59.904 --> 48:01.338
(ominous music continues)

48:57.028 --> 48:58.595
(door creaks and opens)

49:06.170 --> 49:08.605
(tense music building)

49:34.664 --> 49:35.900
(doorbell rings)

49:46.676 --> 49:47.812
(doorbell rings)

50:01.959 --> 50:03.293
Doug.

50:06.230 --> 50:07.798
I was in the area.

50:13.303 --> 50:15.006
We met at the censor's office.

50:17.208 --> 50:18.976
Of course. Enid.

50:20.244 --> 50:21.578
Um...

50:22.445 --> 50:24.182
Sorry, I've been having
a bit of bother.

50:24.314 --> 50:28.585
Um, some people don't seem
to like my films.

50:36.027 --> 50:37.327
Do come in.

50:46.904 --> 50:48.371
Through here.

50:49.006 --> 50:50.774
(rain pattering)

50:57.014 --> 50:58.615
Do you live alone?

51:01.785 --> 51:03.787
Yes. I live alone.

51:13.030 --> 51:14.698
This room seems familiar.

51:16.033 --> 51:17.101
Doug: Must be a sign.

51:17.235 --> 51:18.702
(pouring drink)

51:18.836 --> 51:21.906
It's the rape scene
from <i>Extreme Coda.</i>

51:21.973 --> 51:22.974
(glasses clinking)

51:24.041 --> 51:25.843
Doug: Someone's got a keen eye.

51:32.250 --> 51:34.384
I got this for Coda in LA.

51:37.822 --> 51:39.789
Go to the States
quite a bit actually.

51:48.431 --> 51:49.967
We look similar, don't we?

51:51.035 --> 51:51.936
Who?

51:52.469 --> 51:53.804
Me and Alice Lee.

52:00.378 --> 52:01.578
You do actually.

52:01.711 --> 52:03.780
I knew
you reminded me of someone.

52:04.614 --> 52:07.051
Why don't we get
this wet coat off?

52:12.957 --> 52:14.724
What's Frederick like?

52:14.859 --> 52:16.459
What can I say?

52:17.460 --> 52:20.932
He's a provocateur and a genius.

52:22.099 --> 52:23.733
He's widely misunderstood.

52:26.736 --> 52:28.906
You enjoyed <i>Don't Go In
The Church</i> then, huh?

52:30.841 --> 52:33.044
Frederick pressed
for you to view it.

52:34.378 --> 52:36.646
Wanted a woman's eye
on his film.

52:39.116 --> 52:40.650
You not enjoying your scotch?

52:52.595 --> 52:54.497
You might be interested to hear
that he's shooting

52:54.564 --> 52:57.068
a juicy sequel
to Church at the moment,

52:57.667 --> 53:00.037
with the monstrous 'Beastman'.

53:01.372 --> 53:03.174
Sequels are all the rage
these days.

53:07.345 --> 53:08.846
Where are they filming it?

53:10.513 --> 53:11.849
Near Frederick's.

53:11.983 --> 53:14.018
In the forest
where we shot the original.

53:15.319 --> 53:16.954
And Alice Lee's in it?

53:17.088 --> 53:18.488
It'll be her last film.

53:19.256 --> 53:21.758
She's come to the end
of her shelf life, that one.

53:22.326 --> 53:24.061
W... what does that mean?

53:29.233 --> 53:33.437
(groans) Let's not talk
about some silly actress.

53:34.205 --> 53:37.475
Far more interested in talking
about you, Enid.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.377
What's going to happen to Alice?

53:39.509 --> 53:41.045
Well, that's top secret.

53:42.480 --> 53:44.215
Frederick abducted her,
didn't he?

53:44.514 --> 53:45.648
I can abduct you if you want.

53:45.782 --> 53:47.852
- Stop! Get off me.
- What?

53:48.518 --> 53:50.054
- Came round my house.
- Let go of me.

53:50.121 --> 53:52.823
- You fucking prick tease.
- Just let go of me, please!

53:53.224 --> 53:54.524
- Stop.
- Get...

53:54.657 --> 53:56.427
Stop!
Please stop!

53:56.526 --> 53:58.295
- (grunting)
- Enid: Just let go of me!

53:58.396 --> 54:01.098
(Doug gurgles)

54:14.412 --> 54:15.712
(shivers)

54:20.284 --> 54:22.319
(gasps and gurgles)

54:39.804 --> 54:42.106
- (inhales deeply)
- (shoulder cracks)

54:47.744 --> 54:49.779
Thank you for the whiskey.

54:51.148 --> 54:52.817
I'll see myself out.

55:00.224 --> 55:01.758
(breathes deeply)

55:16.974 --> 55:18.675
(phone rings)

55:26.951 --> 55:27.985
Caller:
<i>You fucking sick bitch.</i>

55:28.119 --> 55:29.652
<i>I hope you get
what's coming to you.</i>

55:29.786 --> 55:32.622
<i>You deserve to get sliced up,
you fucking prick tease.</i>

55:32.755 --> 55:33.958
<i>People like you shouldn't be</i>

55:34.024 --> 55:35.725
<i>given any bloody
responsibility.</i>

55:35.860 --> 55:37.294
<i>The evil is contagious</i>

55:37.361 --> 55:39.497
<i>and it's all your fault,
you horrible woman.</i>

55:39.629 --> 55:40.965
<i>You came round
my fucking house.</i>

55:41.098 --> 55:44.001
<i>He's shooting a juicy sequel
to Church at the moment.</i>

55:44.268 --> 55:45.735
<i>You're rotten inside.</i>

55:45.870 --> 55:47.805
<i>Nothing you ever do
will be any good.</i>

55:47.872 --> 55:50.141
<i>You touch things,
and they go to shit.</i>

55:50.241 --> 55:51.876
(voice becomes indistinct)

55:54.578 --> 55:58.282
(distant screams)

56:04.288 --> 56:06.223
(whispers echo)

56:07.258 --> 56:09.059
<i>Help me, please.</i>

56:09.360 --> 56:11.395
<i>Please, please.</i>

56:11.661 --> 56:13.063
(voices and whispering stop)

56:14.465 --> 56:15.933
(film playing over TV)

56:16.066 --> 56:17.168
Enid?

56:17.568 --> 56:18.836
Anne: You all right?

56:20.703 --> 56:22.907
- (growls)
- (screams)

56:26.310 --> 56:27.878
We are in a viewing here.

56:29.280 --> 56:32.216
Alice Lee: <i>Help me, help me.
Save me, please!</i>

56:32.349 --> 56:33.783
Sanderson: Er, Enid?

56:35.152 --> 56:36.220
Sorry.

56:37.321 --> 56:39.089
Someone's losing the plot.

56:39.823 --> 56:41.992
(scream echoes)

56:47.431 --> 56:50.034
Hello? Can I help you?

56:53.270 --> 56:55.105
Excuse me, Enid!

57:00.444 --> 57:01.879
What do you think you're doing?

57:07.685 --> 57:10.054
Everything is
under control, Valerie.

57:10.221 --> 57:11.488
All right?

57:11.922 --> 57:14.124
No! No, no, no!
You're not authorized!

57:14.258 --> 57:16.227
Anne: "The Amnesiac Killer
stated in court

57:16.360 --> 57:18.062
that he had never seen
the film <i>Deranged,</i>

57:18.195 --> 57:19.496
which is supposed
to have influenced

57:19.597 --> 57:20.531
- the attack on..."
- What?

57:20.598 --> 57:22.299
So, he didn't even watch it?

57:22.433 --> 57:23.500
That's what it says here.

57:23.634 --> 57:25.768
(clamoring)

57:34.445 --> 57:35.546
Get back!

57:36.013 --> 57:38.315
(clamoring continues)

57:43.053 --> 57:45.322
- (clamor grows distant)
- (static)

57:48.826 --> 57:50.394
(inaudible)

58:04.275 --> 58:06.910
(ominous music playing)

59:39.870 --> 59:42.539
(distant screams)

59:47.711 --> 59:50.414
(screams)

01:00:30.287 --> 01:00:33.290
Is this the film shoot
with Alice Lee?

01:00:42.966 --> 01:00:44.268
You're late.

01:00:48.472 --> 01:00:49.473
Sorry?

01:00:50.974 --> 01:00:54.211
I'm Debbie.
I'll be doing your make-up.

01:01:02.252 --> 01:01:04.354
You don't look anything
like your picture.

01:01:06.256 --> 01:01:09.259
At least you're here.
Half the cast haven't turned up.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.595
Production's all over the place.

01:01:20.571 --> 01:01:21.572
Come on.

01:01:23.106 --> 01:01:24.608
Let's get you ready.

01:01:40.892 --> 01:01:42.593
Debbie: Top off.

01:01:54.939 --> 01:01:56.473
Head through.

01:01:56.941 --> 01:01:58.442
Head through.

01:02:10.822 --> 01:02:11.755
Sit.

01:02:13.123 --> 01:02:14.691
Down on the chair.

01:02:31.575 --> 01:02:32.576
(knocks on door)

01:02:32.709 --> 01:02:34.012
Frank: Debbie!

01:02:34.177 --> 01:02:35.746
Is that the sister?

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.981
Yeah.

01:02:37.447 --> 01:02:39.716
Frank: Frederick wants her
down in the forest.

01:02:39.851 --> 01:02:41.518
He's getting impatient.

01:02:42.921 --> 01:02:46.123
Oh, also still no sign
of the producer.

01:02:55.934 --> 01:02:57.801
It's so weird.

01:02:58.502 --> 01:02:59.469
Mm?

01:03:01.305 --> 01:03:04.274
Doug never misses
a gory murder scene.

01:03:09.646 --> 01:03:11.748
(ominous music playing)

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.810
What have they got planned
for Alice Lee?

01:03:41.678 --> 01:03:43.113
What do you mean?

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:47.484
Look at me.

01:03:48.719 --> 01:03:50.187
(camera clicks)

01:03:52.356 --> 01:03:54.391
(haunting music playing)

01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:55.759
(animal cry)

01:04:32.096 --> 01:04:34.231
Frederick:
I've been waiting for you.

01:04:36.834 --> 01:04:39.369
Fred... Frederick North?

01:04:40.938 --> 01:04:44.708
Frederick: Step into the light,
so I can see you.

01:04:47.544 --> 01:04:48.645
Hurry up.

01:04:58.188 --> 01:04:59.690
Where's Alice Lee?

01:05:02.359 --> 01:05:03.928
Frederick: Big fan, are you?

01:05:06.496 --> 01:05:08.933
Well, someone told me
this was her last picture.

01:05:13.303 --> 01:05:15.372
You're guarded.

01:05:19.776 --> 01:05:22.779
That comes from a place
of fear, doesn't it?

01:05:26.516 --> 01:05:29.586
I want you to tell me
about <i>Don't Go In The Church.</i>

01:05:31.655 --> 01:05:32.656
That...

01:05:34.125 --> 01:05:36.393
That bit with the girls
where did the...

01:05:36.526 --> 01:05:38.462
where did the idea come from?

01:05:41.165 --> 01:05:43.233
Frederick:
Had an effect on you, did it?

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.240
(sniffs)

01:05:51.209 --> 01:05:53.243
That scene...

01:05:57.949 --> 01:05:59.516
That scene...

01:06:01.752 --> 01:06:03.653
was inspired

01:06:05.655 --> 01:06:07.424
by a true story.

01:06:09.326 --> 01:06:10.694
(reel whirring)

01:06:12.629 --> 01:06:14.899
Frederick: All of my ideas...

01:06:16.433 --> 01:06:19.770
are drawn from real life.

01:06:22.173 --> 01:06:23.875
Well, that's not what happened.

01:06:24.775 --> 01:06:29.379
Frederick: People think
that I create...

01:06:30.148 --> 01:06:31.581
the horror,

01:06:32.016 --> 01:06:33.383
but I don't.

01:06:35.685 --> 01:06:39.056
Horror is already out there...

01:06:40.925 --> 01:06:42.359
in all of us.

01:06:44.195 --> 01:06:45.662
It's in you.

01:06:46.396 --> 01:06:47.631
No, it's not.

01:06:47.764 --> 01:06:49.466
Frederick:
Of course, it is.

01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:53.303
(chuckles) Don't be so naïve.

01:06:54.504 --> 01:06:56.506
If you're gonna do this,

01:06:57.507 --> 01:07:00.144
I will need you to access

01:07:00.278 --> 01:07:02.814
your darkest impulses.

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.049
I don't have any.

01:07:06.884 --> 01:07:10.487
Frederick: No, they're in there.
Somewhere.

01:07:11.189 --> 01:07:13.390
- No, they're not.
- Oh, come on!

01:07:14.791 --> 01:07:16.861
Fucking commit!

01:07:20.832 --> 01:07:22.099
Improvise.

01:07:26.137 --> 01:07:29.739
Take control of your story.

01:07:33.277 --> 01:07:34.477
No.

01:07:34.611 --> 01:07:36.479
Okay, piss off then!

01:07:36.613 --> 01:07:38.481
No, please, no! Wait, wait!
Please, please. Wait.

01:07:38.548 --> 01:07:39.783
I just want my sister.

01:07:39.917 --> 01:07:42.186
I just want to see her!
I just really want to see

01:07:42.253 --> 01:07:45.388
my little sister.
I want her back, please!

01:07:45.957 --> 01:07:47.024
Please!

01:07:50.393 --> 01:07:51.695
Frederick: All right.

01:07:54.098 --> 01:07:55.732
All right, we'll go with that.

01:07:57.701 --> 01:07:58.735
Let's play.

01:08:00.338 --> 01:08:03.875
There's something rotten
inside you.

01:08:04.608 --> 01:08:06.911
You try to control it,

01:08:07.044 --> 01:08:09.779
but you only make things worse.

01:08:10.915 --> 01:08:13.084
Don't fight it anymore.

01:08:13.217 --> 01:08:15.086
- Stop.
- Just let it out!

01:08:15.219 --> 01:08:16.620
Stop, it's you.

01:08:16.685 --> 01:08:18.421
You're trying to make me out
to be the bad person

01:08:18.488 --> 01:08:20.091
and it's you. Stop!

01:08:20.224 --> 01:08:21.758
There. That's it.

01:08:23.027 --> 01:08:25.029
And we'll take that energy

01:08:25.462 --> 01:08:26.863
into the scene.

01:08:29.033 --> 01:08:30.033
Come...

01:08:32.602 --> 01:08:34.171
enter your story.

01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:42.145
- (reel whirring)
- (heavy breathing)

01:08:46.017 --> 01:08:47.885
(loud whirring)

01:08:51.087 --> 01:08:52.689
(ominous music playing)

01:08:54.292 --> 01:08:55.826
(gasps)

01:09:11.441 --> 01:09:13.542
(chimes)

01:09:25.923 --> 01:09:27.524
Beastman: My love.

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:35.966
I have been waiting for you.

01:09:37.033 --> 01:09:39.837
For such a long time.

01:09:40.837 --> 01:09:44.809
You have always been
in my heart.

01:09:47.711 --> 01:09:50.113
(tense music playing)

01:10:12.103 --> 01:10:13.803
(chain rattles)

01:10:18.442 --> 01:10:19.776
Enid: No.

01:10:23.914 --> 01:10:25.950
(screams)

01:10:26.083 --> 01:10:28.651
(screams and cries)

01:10:30.587 --> 01:10:33.190
Beastman: There's something
rotten inside you.

01:10:34.025 --> 01:10:35.159
Twisted up.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:38.762
It secretes bad things.

01:10:39.397 --> 01:10:42.665
Stop fighting it. Let it out!

01:10:43.134 --> 01:10:46.971
You know you are evil.

01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:02.219
No, this is not in the script!
No, no, no!

01:11:02.286 --> 01:11:03.988
(screams)

01:11:08.926 --> 01:11:10.828
(Alice screams)

01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:14.198
Charles!

01:11:14.764 --> 01:11:18.235
- (choking)
- (Alice whimpering)

01:11:20.337 --> 01:11:21.872
(exhales)

01:11:33.583 --> 01:11:35.419
(cracking)

01:11:35.553 --> 01:11:40.224
I am the horror!

01:11:41.591 --> 01:11:42.993
(screams)

01:11:47.764 --> 01:11:48.899
- Frederick: Cut!
- (Alice screams)

01:11:49.033 --> 01:11:50.534
Frederick:
What the fuck is going on?

01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:51.869
Alice: Charles!

01:11:52.002 --> 01:11:54.138
- Charles?
- Alice: (crying) No!

01:11:54.271 --> 01:11:56.040
What are you doing?

01:11:59.243 --> 01:12:00.878
(crew member coughs)

01:12:01.011 --> 01:12:02.679
(screams)

01:12:02.813 --> 01:12:04.949
- Alice: Frederick!
- No.

01:12:05.516 --> 01:12:07.318
(coughs)

01:12:07.451 --> 01:12:08.919
What? W... Why w...

01:12:09.053 --> 01:12:12.189
You did this!
This is all your fault!

01:12:13.357 --> 01:12:16.759
(screams

01:12:17.828 --> 01:12:20.231
Nina!
Come back!

01:12:21.365 --> 01:12:23.434
- Nina!
- (cries out)

01:12:23.601 --> 01:12:24.869
Nina!

01:12:25.002 --> 01:12:27.404
No, please, please, please!
Get away from me, please!

01:12:27.538 --> 01:12:29.240
It's all right. It's all right.
It's me!

01:12:29.807 --> 01:12:33.043
It's me, Enid. All right?
I'm your sister.

01:12:33.544 --> 01:12:36.814
(crying)
You... You killed Charles.

01:12:38.516 --> 01:12:41.651
No. No, he was gonna hurt you.

01:12:42.286 --> 01:12:45.256
Alice Lee: (sobbing)
He was my friend!

01:12:46.123 --> 01:12:51.028
No, everything that I have done
is to protect you.

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:54.532
All right?
To make things right.

01:12:54.664 --> 01:12:56.433
- (sobbing) You're insane.
- No! Please.

01:12:56.567 --> 01:12:57.835
(screams)
Please!

01:12:58.068 --> 01:13:00.204
- Please don't hurt me!
- No, it's all right, it's all right!

01:13:01.205 --> 01:13:02.373
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:13:03.807 --> 01:13:05.209
Never hurt you.

01:13:07.545 --> 01:13:09.246
'Cause you're my sister.

01:13:10.247 --> 01:13:11.882
W... what?

01:13:13.716 --> 01:13:15.785
That wasn't real!

01:13:18.788 --> 01:13:21.025
