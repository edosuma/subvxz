WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:16.016
(beeping)

00:22.490 --> 00:23.324
Hey, Charlie.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.226
Find anything
you can help us with?

00:25.259 --> 00:26.294
Yeah.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.461
These cases won't benefit

00:27.495 --> 00:28.662
from mathematical applications.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.065
Although, we could approach
all these with Chaos Theory.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.366
Yeah. Chaos I got.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.102
Right, but with chaos,
there's no telling

00:34.135 --> 00:35.103
where a case will lead,

00:35.136 --> 00:36.637
and there could be
mathematical applications

00:36.670 --> 00:39.840
I can't detect yet.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.343
I love that about you.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.245
What?

00:44.278 --> 00:46.214
You never give up, do you?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.216
Well, there's always
a solution, Don.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.551
You know, if there's
any limitation, it's got to be

00:50.584 --> 00:52.186
in the mathematician,
not the math.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.587
How about fun, Charlie?

00:53.621 --> 00:55.356
What do you ever do for fun?

00:55.389 --> 00:56.590
Well, if you must
know, Dad thought

00:56.624 --> 00:58.792
playing golf was something we
might enjoy doing together.

00:58.826 --> 00:59.793
I'm sure he did.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.862
You know he's like
an eight handicap, right?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.264
I'm a pretty quick study.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.199
Just don't let him talk you
into betting.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.400
Last time we played, he took me

01:06.434 --> 01:07.601
for 20 bucks.

01:07.635 --> 01:08.769
Hey.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.704
DON:
What's up?

01:10.738 --> 01:12.173
In the last ten minutes,

01:12.206 --> 01:14.208
the FAA's received
seven eyewitness reports

01:14.242 --> 01:15.576
of an unidentified object

01:15.609 --> 01:17.745
flying low over
the San Fernando Valley headed

01:17.778 --> 01:19.780
- toward Los Angeles.
- What about a radar signature?

01:19.813 --> 01:20.814
That's just it.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.451
The object's not showing up
on either civilian

01:23.484 --> 01:25.319
or military radar.
Edwards Airforce Base

01:25.353 --> 01:27.655
is scrambling two F-16s
for an overflight.

01:27.688 --> 01:28.556
Sounds serious.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.191
Homeland Security's
been warning about

01:30.224 --> 01:32.126
a small craft terrorist attack
for months.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.528
No flight plan, no contact
with air traffic control.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.397
We have to assume
this craft is hostile.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.631
What about you taking
the sightings

01:37.665 --> 01:38.832
and trying
to plot a flight path?

01:38.866 --> 01:39.833
Oh, well, I...

01:39.867 --> 01:40.701
Just give it a try.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.136
If he does it,
patch him through to me.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.204
Okay. Where you going?

01:43.237 --> 01:44.872
I'm gonna go up to the roof,
see if see anything.

01:44.905 --> 01:45.873
Contact Homeland Security.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.176
See if they have
a military attachГ© in the area.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.143
I want to monitor their com.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.815
- Agent Eppes?
- Yes, sir.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.317
- Anything yet?
- Nothing.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.686
PILOT:
Military ATC, this is Rogue One

01:58.719 --> 02:02.190
at Echo Delta Tango four, four,
niner and descending.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.192
That's our two F-16s coming in.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.360
ATC: Rogue One, you are cleared
as assigned.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.895
Make best time on target.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.897
Hey, Charlie,
what do you got for me?

02:09.930 --> 02:10.898
You got anything?

02:10.931 --> 02:11.865
Based on these sightings,

02:11.899 --> 02:14.268
the object should be
over Glendale on heading

02:14.302 --> 02:16.170
1-1-8.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.405
Glendale.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.407
( man laughing )

02:19.440 --> 02:21.509
( indistinct chatter )

02:33.287 --> 02:34.688
MAN:
Did you see that?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.829
You got it? Are you sure?

02:41.862 --> 02:43.931
New LAPD sighting one mile north

02:43.964 --> 02:45.966
of the Silver Lake Reservoir.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.202
Don, based on this new sighting,
I estimate

02:48.236 --> 02:50.504
the object is on a direct course
for downtown Los Angeles.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.607
Downtown? Are you sure?

02:53.641 --> 02:55.643
Yeah, if these reports
are right.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.318
Military Air Traffic Control,

03:04.352 --> 03:05.319
this is Leader One.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.287
Direct Rogues
One and Two

03:06.320 --> 03:07.988
on a direct heading
to downtown Los Angeles.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.122
ATC:
Roger that, Leader One.

03:09.156 --> 03:12.493
PILOT: ATC, this is Rogue One
and Two on new heading.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.763
Nose is warm, visuals are clear,
weapon systems are hot.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.732
Pinging on PRF.
All frequencies.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.968
Charlie, I don't see anything.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.636
Look, according
to my calculations,

03:22.670 --> 03:24.738
it should be just north
of downtown.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.407
It's got to be
right there.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.575
( loud whooshing )

03:30.344 --> 03:32.413
PILOT: Rogue One checking
one-zero, one-one and one-two.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.481
Negative contact.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.983
PILOT 2: Rogue Two, checking
one, two and three.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.352
No Joy. Repeat, no joy.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.387
Where the hell is it?

03:39.420 --> 03:40.588
ATC:
Echo Delta Tango.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.990
Night sky clean and clear.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.792
Rogue One, this is Leader One.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.026
Confirm your visual.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.495
PILOT 1:
Roger, Leader One.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.330
That's a negative.

03:49.363 --> 03:52.300
Whatever you boys were chasing,
sir, it's gone.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.534
(whooshing)

03:56.437 --> 03:58.572
( echoing ):
We all use math every day...

03:58.606 --> 04:00.441
to predict weather...

04:00.474 --> 04:03.477
to tell time...

04:03.511 --> 04:06.580
to handle money.

04:06.614 --> 04:10.784
Math is more than formulas and
equations.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.821
It's logic.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.357
It's rationality.

04:16.390 --> 04:20.628
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.303
It's over here.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.638
Came right over
those trees.

04:30.671 --> 04:31.572
DAVID:
How long it take

04:31.605 --> 04:32.740
to pass by?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.342
Uh, five, ten
seconds, maybe.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.609
Not very fast.

04:35.643 --> 04:36.644
How high you think it was?

04:36.677 --> 04:37.811
Few hundred feet.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.513
Yeah? What did
it look like?

04:39.547 --> 04:41.349
Dark, lights
all around.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.516
I have a video.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.485
- My wife shot it.
- You have a video?

04:44.518 --> 04:46.754
It's not great.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.655
- We still need to see it.
- Sure

04:47.688 --> 04:48.155
We'll get it
back to you.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.659
( sighs )

04:51.692 --> 04:52.726
Man, I was hoping
it was some idiot

04:52.760 --> 04:54.795
in a Cessna getting his
pilot's license, you know?

04:54.828 --> 04:56.730
Altitude, speed,
path toward downtown.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.467
Could have been the practice run
for a terror strike.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.601
Test our responses?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.536
Maybe.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.738
Like I said,
it's not great.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.978
There. There it is...

05:11.011 --> 05:12.680
All right, wait...

05:12.713 --> 05:14.615
Just freeze it.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.351
Yeah, he was right.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.652
- It's not great.
- Uh-uh.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.120
I don't know...

05:20.153 --> 05:21.555
- Agent Eppes?
- Yeah.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.723
Hi. Erica Weston.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.625
National Transportation
Safety Board.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.659
Oh,hey Erica. Don.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.860
- Hi, Don.
- David Sinclair.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.061
- David.
- Thanks for coming.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.563
Not a problem.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.365
Post 9/11,
U-A-E's are a top priority.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.866
U-A-Es?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.001
Unexplained Aerial Events.

05:34.034 --> 05:34.802
Your seven sightings--

05:34.835 --> 05:36.637
they're all consistent
with this?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.372
Yeah, pretty much.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.474
We might be looking at an MPH.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.476
Not a U-A-E?

05:42.510 --> 05:44.678
Sorry.
Occupational hazard.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.047
Multi-Person Hoax.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.048
Yeah, I don't know.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.951
I mean, it seems
pretty elaborate to be a prank.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.553
17 years ago in Michigan,

05:52.586 --> 05:54.455
eight ultralites flew
in formation at night

05:54.488 --> 05:55.756
to create the appearance
of a UFO.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.725
Well, I don't want
to assume it's a hoax.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.592
I mean, we need to find out

05:58.626 --> 06:00.461
where it came from
and where it went.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.596
I'm thinking maybe
Charlie might be helpful.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.807
That was better.

06:13.841 --> 06:14.775
- What?
- It was.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.009
You almost hit the ball.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.145
You know, I'm-I'm the king
at basketball,

06:18.178 --> 06:19.513
I-I can snowboard,

06:19.547 --> 06:20.514
I'm the best
at video games,

06:20.548 --> 06:22.683
I'm even getting over my fear of
rock climbing,

06:22.716 --> 06:23.784
but I still...

06:23.817 --> 06:25.419
I can't hit this
little white ball.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.721
Because you're lifting up.
You're trying to find out

06:27.755 --> 06:29.623
where the ball is going.
Now all you have to do

06:29.657 --> 06:31.992
is just trust your instincts
and let me watch for the ball.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.561
- Go ahead.
- All right.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.732
All right,
that was... better.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.801
I stink.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.604
Charlie, do you always have
to excel at what you do?

06:43.637 --> 06:44.838
This shouldn't
be happening.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.173
I've worked
these numbers.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.709
Hey, come on,
this is what is known as fun.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.579
Out here together in the...
in the fresh air.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.213
- Isn't that enough?
- Don't get me wrong.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.816
It's not like I'm not enjoying
myself with you, Dad.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.117
It's just, I'm just surprised

06:57.150 --> 06:58.686
the math isn't
giving me an edge.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.687
Yeah. All right,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.822
now you just...
watch and learn.

07:01.855 --> 07:02.823
Now you sit down

07:02.856 --> 07:04.825
like you're
on a stick, hmm?

07:04.858 --> 07:07.194
And let your hands
work together.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.663
Draw the club back slowly.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.164
- Huh?
- Awesome.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.000
- That was good.
- See? There's no math involved.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.001
It's all rhythm.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.102
( cell phone rings )

07:15.135 --> 07:17.705
It's just... rhythm.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.672
Oh, rhythm.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.907
There's a rule
on the course

07:19.940 --> 07:21.208
about cell
phones, you know.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.710
Yeah, I know. Hey, Don.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.677
Hey, what's up?

07:23.711 --> 07:25.813
Yeah, you got it.

07:25.846 --> 07:26.980
Okay, bye.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.853
CHARLIE:
Hey, sorry I'm late.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.221
Dad wanted to walk.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.823
Took us a little longer
to get back

07:35.856 --> 07:37.725
to the clubhouse
than I'd estimated.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.627
It's okay. Charlie,
this is Erica Weston

07:39.660 --> 07:40.994
from the NTSB.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.796
She specializes
in what they call

07:42.830 --> 07:43.964
Unidentified Aerial Events.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.065
Hi. Pleasure.
Nice meeting you.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.133
Hi. Likewise.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.801
You're right on time. Your
student just finished

07:47.835 --> 07:48.802
loading our radar images.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.871
CHARLIE:
This is Civilian

07:50.904 --> 07:52.540
- Air Traffic Control?
- ERICA: Right.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.974
These blips are
commercial airliners.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.142
The others are

07:55.175 --> 07:56.510
small planes,

07:56.544 --> 07:58.546
but over here,
where our bogey was,

07:58.579 --> 07:59.813
there's nothing.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.015
Hmm. What do you think?

08:02.049 --> 08:04.017
Well, there's a lot
of noise in the system.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.919
Hmm. What about trying the noisy
edge?

08:05.953 --> 08:07.220
- Mm-hmm.
- DON: What's that?

08:07.254 --> 08:08.756
AMITA: Well, there's random
noise

08:08.789 --> 08:09.790
in every
radar system.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.759
And sometimes the signals
the radar's designed

08:11.792 --> 08:12.760
to pick up are so weak,

08:12.793 --> 08:14.294
they're obscured
by the noise.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.729
Here. Listen.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.731
( hissing )

08:17.765 --> 08:19.933
CHARLIE: That noise you're
hearing

08:19.967 --> 08:22.570
is really the noise
of the system.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.436
Without a signal,

08:23.470 --> 08:24.972
all we're hearing
is random energy.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.774
ERICA:
How do you find

08:26.807 --> 08:27.808
signals that faint?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.209
It's called Squish/Squash.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.078
It's a technique

08:31.111 --> 08:32.245
that was developed

08:32.279 --> 08:33.614
by a mathematician

08:33.647 --> 08:35.315
from the University of Alberta
in Canada.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.751
Looks for anything
that looks like a-a weak signal,

08:37.785 --> 08:40.554
and then mathematically
squishes and squashes that data

08:40.588 --> 08:42.590
to guess at its speed
and at its direction.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.925
How is that possible?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.894
Okay, imagine a...

08:46.927 --> 08:48.328
Imagine a room full

08:48.361 --> 08:49.763
of-of 20 or, um,

08:49.797 --> 08:51.231
or 30 people clapping.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.969
Now some people clap loud,
some soft.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.572
Most generally
at the same pace.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.708
Now imagine a woman
in that audience

09:00.741 --> 09:02.776
clapping much, much slower,

09:02.810 --> 09:05.312
clapping at
a very specific rhythm.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.048
Her rhythmic clap is
the signal we want to track.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.917
But we can't.
We can't hear it

09:09.950 --> 09:11.852
amongst the random clapping.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.754
The signal's lost in the noise.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.890
However, Squish/Squash
allows us

09:16.924 --> 09:19.359
to isolate the rhythmic clap
and track it.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.095
DON: So with that, you can
pinpoint the flight path?

09:22.129 --> 09:23.764
Where it started
and where it ended?

09:23.797 --> 09:25.365
Probably.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.900
And how long would that take?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.201
Oh, it's hard to say right now.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.070
Well, I mean, if we're dealing
with terrorists,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.772
and they make another run,
Charlie...

09:31.805 --> 09:33.006
Right.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.174
Well, Larry has time booked

09:34.207 --> 09:35.042
in the
computer lab.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.043
I mean, that could help us

09:36.076 --> 09:37.144
- run this program much faster.
- Call Larry.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.783
When you first told me
you wanted to run an advanced

09:42.816 --> 09:45.252
conditional probability
distribution application,

09:45.285 --> 09:46.754
I was delighted.

09:46.787 --> 09:47.721
Naturally, I assumed

09:47.755 --> 09:49.957
we were about to attempt a model
of my theory

09:49.990 --> 09:52.092
concerning the distribution
of gravity waves.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.894
I'm sorry, Larry.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.964
But no, little did I realize
my slender budgetary resources

09:56.997 --> 09:59.767
were being used to
finance a UFO hunt.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.901
Well, I think

10:00.934 --> 10:04.204
the more accurate term is
Unexplained Aerial Event.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.172
Right, and-and you know

10:05.205 --> 10:07.007
I'll get the FBI
to reimburse you, I promise.

10:07.040 --> 10:07.941
Oh, I-I suppose

10:07.975 --> 10:09.777
national security
has to take priority.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.680
Yes. Thank you for
being understanding.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.949
You say this craft
left no radar signature?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.818
Nothing visible.

10:17.851 --> 10:18.952
So, what assumptions
are we making

10:18.986 --> 10:20.220
for the program
you're running?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.189
Well, the FBI has eliminated
weather balloons.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.024
They've eliminated
ultralite aircraft,

10:24.057 --> 10:26.026
helicopters
and military drones.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.294
Which leaves us...?

10:27.327 --> 10:30.030
I think the highest probability
is that it's some kind of small,

10:30.063 --> 10:33.300
piloted aircraft that was flying
without a radar transponder,

10:33.333 --> 10:35.168
or one that was turned off.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.336
Well,

10:36.369 --> 10:39.873
keep in mind,
quantum physics maintains

10:39.907 --> 10:41.942
an infinite number
of possibilities.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.878
This might have nothing to do
with man or machine.

10:44.912 --> 10:48.415
Oh, this could be some sort
of inter-dimensional event or...

10:48.448 --> 10:50.951
Yes, it might even be

10:50.984 --> 10:52.953
a vehicle from another part
of the universe

10:52.986 --> 10:54.788
using a type of propulsion

10:54.822 --> 10:56.890
we can't even begin
to understand.

10:56.924 --> 10:59.059
Okay, Larry. We'll try
and factor that in, as well.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.761
LARRY:
Okay, you two, you make

11:00.794 --> 11:01.929
your little jokes.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.030
The fact remains,

11:03.063 --> 11:04.765
we may not be alone.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.767
( computer beeping )

11:06.800 --> 11:08.001
What-What's that?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.202
That's the Squish/Squash

11:09.236 --> 11:11.371
program calculating
the object's

11:11.404 --> 11:12.940
likely flight path.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.375
LARRY: Well, it looks like the
flight path of our

11:15.408 --> 11:17.945
mysterious little object

11:17.978 --> 11:20.914
is suddenly becoming
a lot less mysterious.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.951
CHARLIE: This is the path of the
object as calculated

11:23.984 --> 11:25.786
by the Squish/Sguash algorithms.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.924
ERICA:
And what happens here?

11:30.958 --> 11:32.826
The signal becomes too thin
to track.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.927
DON: What, right around the time

11:33.961 --> 11:35.095
it reaches downtown?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.930
Right, but

11:36.964 --> 11:38.999
if we follow the projection
of the data,

11:39.032 --> 11:41.835
the flight takes us
over the city.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.270
Now, where's that on the map?

11:44.972 --> 11:46.940
That is right over
the Staples Center.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.141
ERICA:
Or right into it.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.310
Major sports venue,
thousands of innocents.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.079
Exactly the kind
of high visibility

11:52.112 --> 11:53.981
soft target
we've been worried about.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.049
Why don't you get a schedule
of upcoming events

11:56.083 --> 11:57.350
at the Staples
Center?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.451
All right.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.960
So, what we have
is a small aircraft

12:06.994 --> 12:08.862
capable of penetrating
densely populated areas

12:08.896 --> 12:09.930
without detection.

12:09.963 --> 12:10.931
Obvious dangers are is

12:10.964 --> 12:14.134
if it crashes into a building
or God forbid

12:14.167 --> 12:15.535
disseminates a WMD.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.138
Ms. Weston has the,
the good news.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.272
We now believe
we know the location

12:19.306 --> 12:20.373
of the flight's origination.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.243
According to Professor Eppes,

12:23.276 --> 12:24.344
craft took off

12:24.377 --> 12:25.512
from somewhere in here.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.447
What I'm calling
the "area of origin."

12:27.480 --> 12:30.083
And assuming we're looking
for a fixed-wing airplane,

12:30.117 --> 12:32.219
it would need a runway
to take off from.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.121
How many strips are
in the area of origin?

12:34.154 --> 12:36.489
One commercial, four
recreational airfields.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.690
We need to cover them all.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.227
I mean, track every single plane
that took off that night.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.428
Talk to as many pilots
as possible.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.163
I mean, somebody
had to see the thing.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.865
- All right.
- Okay, let's do it.

12:44.898 --> 12:45.799
Okay let's go.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.298
I don't get it. The aircraft
should have originated

13:18.331 --> 13:20.300
from an airfield
that the FBI checked out.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.502
You know, here's where I get
reductive on your ass,

13:22.535 --> 13:24.304
'cause you keep
saying "aircraft,"

13:24.337 --> 13:26.173
but so far,
no one's been able to identify

13:26.206 --> 13:27.941
whatever it was
that people saw.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.010
What are you saying, Larry?

13:30.043 --> 13:32.279
I'm saying instead of
building a flight path,

13:32.312 --> 13:34.481
let's try focusing
on the object itself?

13:34.514 --> 13:35.849
You know what?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.184
He's right.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.319
We could get a visual
of the object

13:39.352 --> 13:41.154
by building in all
the radar sources

13:41.188 --> 13:42.222
at the same time

13:42.255 --> 13:43.924
yes, civilian and military.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.125
So...

13:45.158 --> 13:46.894
- overlap the radar sources?
- That's right.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.361
By layering the images,
we could build

13:48.395 --> 13:51.298
a three-dimensional
cross-section of it...

13:51.331 --> 13:52.532
( typing )

13:55.903 --> 13:56.970
( beeping )

13:57.004 --> 13:57.971
There.

13:58.005 --> 14:02.075
Now it's working off of
all seven radar sources.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.277
And it's building
an image of the object.

14:06.079 --> 14:09.116
( blipping )

14:13.386 --> 14:16.456
( blipping continues )

14:16.489 --> 14:18.091
Charlie?

14:18.125 --> 14:19.626
Is that what I think it is?

14:19.659 --> 14:21.261
Now, le-let's
be very, very careful.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.030
We shouldn't jump
to any conclusions

14:23.063 --> 14:24.264
or make any assumptions.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.133
There could be any
number of reasons

14:26.166 --> 14:28.201
why that looks like...

14:28.235 --> 14:30.237
A vehicle from another part
of the universe.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.241
I mean, sure, it looks

14:34.274 --> 14:35.909
like a real UFO.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.344
We don't know
what a UFO looks like.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.079
How can you say
this looks like a real one?

14:39.112 --> 14:40.380
It's cutting-edge
aeronautical design,

14:40.413 --> 14:42.415
but it was definitely
made here on Earth.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.283
Well, that's good,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.285
'cause I really
like my job, you know?

14:45.318 --> 14:48.355
ERICA: This is similar to the
blended wing design.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.458
You know, the same one used
to create the B2 bomber.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.994
It's a concept, actually,
that dates back to 1939,

14:54.027 --> 14:56.363
when Lyle Farver proposed it
to the U.S. Army Air Corps

14:56.396 --> 14:58.298
for a 500-miles-
per-hour fighter.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.633
Something this small?
Pretty radical concept.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.070
Since we were looking for

15:03.103 --> 15:05.038
a fixed-wing aircraft,

15:05.072 --> 15:06.306
naturally we're looking for

15:06.339 --> 15:08.208
an airstrip
where the flight originated.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.309
Right, but we didn't find any.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.477
Which forced us

15:10.510 --> 15:12.245
to consider alternatives.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.347
Freeways,
makeshift runways.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.316
Only any of those
would have had a witness.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.951
Which is why
we have to ask ourselves

15:17.985 --> 15:19.086
a whole different question.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.587
Why assume that this aircraft

15:20.620 --> 15:22.089
needs a runway at all?

15:22.122 --> 15:23.390
Vertical takeoff?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.457
Like one of those, uh,

15:24.491 --> 15:26.026
Harrier jets?

15:26.059 --> 15:28.361
Yeah, only smaller and lighter.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.196
And that would minimize
the power

15:29.229 --> 15:30.563
it would need
for sufficient lift.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.265
Which would explain
why no one heard it.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.201
All right, so, it
takes off straight up

15:34.234 --> 15:35.668
and it's quiet.
How does that explain

15:35.702 --> 15:37.370
it not showing up
on any radar?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.439
Well, there's only
one explanation, really.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.573
It'd be construction material.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.042
Some lightweight

15:42.075 --> 15:43.143
non-metallic composite

15:43.176 --> 15:44.411
that radar wouldn't pick up.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.079
And who makes a plane like that?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.981
Something like this
can't be done overnight.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.049
This is the kind of plan

15:49.082 --> 15:50.417
that would take
years in the making.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.418
Well, still,
it's got to be

15:51.451 --> 15:52.552
a relatively
small community,

15:52.585 --> 15:53.486
right?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.989
I would start
with Nordell Aeronautics.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.624
- Nordell?
- They've been offering

15:57.657 --> 16:01.028
a $5 million prize for a working
craft that has vertical takeoff

16:01.061 --> 16:02.362
for years now.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.534
We've offered
the prize since '97.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.002
No takers?

16:09.036 --> 16:10.337
No winners.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.371
Vertical takeoff's

16:11.404 --> 16:13.573
proven to be a
tough nut to crack

16:13.606 --> 16:15.042
in the field of personal
aircraft.

16:15.075 --> 16:15.708
Personal aircraft?

16:15.742 --> 16:16.809
Some people believe

16:16.843 --> 16:19.579
that once vertical technology's
actually conquered,

16:19.612 --> 16:21.314
affordable and
easy-to-fly aircraft

16:21.348 --> 16:23.483
will eventually replace
the automobile.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.617
I'll tell you,

16:24.651 --> 16:25.618
if this thing really flew,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.620
I'd sure love to talk
to the team behind it.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.456
Yeah, well, so would we.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.191
We were hoping
you might be able to tell us

16:31.224 --> 16:33.293
who'd be capable of putting
a plane like this in the air.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.363
Just a handful of designers,
I can tell you that much.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.430
Anyone out on
the west coast?

16:37.464 --> 16:39.332
There's a couple of engineers

16:39.366 --> 16:41.034
that come to mind:
David Croft

16:41.068 --> 16:42.102
and Lane Gosnell.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.436
How much do you
know about them?

16:43.470 --> 16:45.305
Croft and Gosnell
used to be partners,

16:45.338 --> 16:46.439
until they had a falling out.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.475
Over what?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.377
The direction of the design.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.379
MAN:
You're saying this thing

16:52.412 --> 16:53.546
actually flew?

16:53.580 --> 16:54.547
At least 50 miles.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.117
At heights varying
from several hundred feet

16:57.150 --> 16:59.219
to a few thousand.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.154
This photo
what Gosnell gave you,

17:01.188 --> 17:03.056
or did you actually
see it fly?

17:03.090 --> 17:05.092
Gosnell. You mean
Lane Gosnell,

17:05.125 --> 17:06.293
your former partner?

17:06.326 --> 17:07.627
Well, this is his plane,
isn't it?

17:07.660 --> 17:08.661
Is it?

17:09.796 --> 17:11.331
Unless someone else

17:11.364 --> 17:13.400
stole this wing design
from me.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.402
We understand that
you and Mr. Gosnell

17:15.435 --> 17:16.803
had some sort of dispute.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.472
You might say that.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.441
We were told it was about
the design of this aircraft.

17:21.474 --> 17:24.477
The design had nothing
to do with it.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.313
It was about Lane.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.081
And his, uh,

17:28.115 --> 17:29.382
obsession to be remembered.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.618
You see, with Lane,

17:31.651 --> 17:33.786
it was all about
making a statement.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.555
Showing the world that the rules

17:35.588 --> 17:36.623
didn't apply to him.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.392
Not even
the rules of physics.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.129
Frankly, it didn't matter

17:42.162 --> 17:44.131
how dangerous it was

17:44.164 --> 17:46.799
or who might get hurt
by him doing it.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.435
Mr. Croft, do you
have any idea

17:48.468 --> 17:49.502
where Lane Gosnell is now?

17:49.536 --> 17:51.571
Not a clue.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.240
But when you find him,

17:53.273 --> 17:54.407
you tell him my lawyers

17:54.441 --> 17:56.143
are gonna be talking
to his lawyers.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.183
( typing )

18:06.553 --> 18:07.554
Hey.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.522
Lane Gosnell.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.723
Two years ago,
at a conference

18:10.757 --> 18:12.259
on air traffic
safety in Seattle,

18:12.292 --> 18:13.426
he gives a presentation

18:13.460 --> 18:15.295
in which he claims
the 9/11 hijackers

18:15.328 --> 18:17.530
would someday be viewed
as pioneers in aviation.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.665
He what?

18:18.698 --> 18:20.533
He said the flights
into the Towers

18:20.567 --> 18:21.701
proved that
the average person

18:21.734 --> 18:23.536
was capable of
piloting an aircraft

18:23.570 --> 18:24.704
with a minimal
amount of training.

18:24.737 --> 18:25.738
That's twisted.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.207
Twice he flew a Cessna

18:27.240 --> 18:28.841
into restricted
military airspace.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.278
Twice he had to be escorted out
by U.S. warplanes.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.480
Claimed he did this
in protest of news blackouts

18:33.513 --> 18:34.847
of returning casualties
from Iraq.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.150
Don, why haven't we
locked this guy up?

18:37.184 --> 18:39.686
Oh, we did. He was held for
observation for three weeks,

18:39.719 --> 18:42.555
and he was supposed to undergo
psychiatric counseling.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.690
What happened?

18:43.723 --> 18:44.524
He didn't show.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.393
We got us

18:46.426 --> 18:48.195
an emotionally
disturbed man

18:48.228 --> 18:50.197
trying to make
aviation history.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.901
MAN ( mutters ):
You believe this?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.536
ALAN:
Still can't find it?

18:56.569 --> 18:57.770
No.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.839
ALAN: Why don't we just drop
another ball?

18:59.872 --> 19:00.707
'Cause it has to be here.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.542
The ball was traveling
on a trajectory

19:02.575 --> 19:04.744
whose endpoint would put
it in this immediate area.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.347
Charlie, there's one thing you
got to learn about this game.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.449
Golf balls don't always
do what you expect them to.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.783
Yeah, well, golf balls
have to follow

19:10.817 --> 19:11.851
the rules of physics!

19:11.884 --> 19:13.486
Just like any other object.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.822
Then why do people
keep losing so many of them?

19:15.855 --> 19:17.590
- Chaos.
- Why don't we let this foursome

19:17.624 --> 19:18.725
- play through?
- In a minute.

19:18.758 --> 19:19.892
GOLFER:
We don't have all day!

19:19.926 --> 19:21.394
Now where you going?

19:21.428 --> 19:22.729
Well, there's
no reason to think

19:22.762 --> 19:24.597
the ball landed here.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.666
So it's where I'm looking,

19:26.699 --> 19:29.336
because it
doesn't make sense.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.272
It's where I don't expect it.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.506
Eh...

19:33.540 --> 19:34.841
Here it is.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.580
Except that's not
your ball.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.848
- GOLFER: Let's go, guys.
- What?

19:41.881 --> 19:42.949
Uh, found it!

19:42.982 --> 19:44.384
Come on, let's go.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.486
You can drop the ball
over here.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.856
Well, he hasn't been home
in a couple of days.

19:49.889 --> 19:50.790
Uh, he's been working.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.525
When was the last time
you talked to him?

19:52.559 --> 19:53.593
Few days ago.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.994
What's this all about?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.263
Do you recognize

19:56.296 --> 19:57.464
this aircraft?

19:58.798 --> 19:59.899
Where'd you get this?

19:59.932 --> 20:00.967
So you recognize it?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.569
Yeah, I mean, it's
my dad's plane,

20:02.602 --> 20:04.371
but he didn't want
anybody else seeing it.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.572
Maybe he
shouldn't have

20:05.605 --> 20:06.839
flown it over
Los Angeles, then.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.007
Flown it?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.576
What are you talking about?

20:09.609 --> 20:11.411
That image was captured
on radar two nights ago.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.479
- No.
- Yeah.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.613
Well, that's not possible.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.714
Well, your father's plane

20:14.747 --> 20:16.449
was tracked flying
at low altitudes

20:16.483 --> 20:18.385
in populated areas
with no flight plan

20:18.418 --> 20:19.452
and no radio contact.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.454
If you have any idea
what he was planning, Blake,

20:21.488 --> 20:23.590
and you withhold information
from us, you're looking at

20:23.623 --> 20:24.857
- a serious felony here.
- Blake we need

20:24.891 --> 20:26.593
to talk to your father
right away.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.660
Okay, yeah, sure.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.595
I mean, he's at his workshop,

20:28.628 --> 20:30.397
but I'm telling you,
the plane is there.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.731
Where's his workshop?

20:31.764 --> 20:34.401
( dog barking )

20:39.706 --> 20:40.740
That's his truck,

20:40.773 --> 20:42.442
so he should be here.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.478
Hey, Dad!

20:47.079 --> 20:49.916
Dad, you in there?

21:12.805 --> 21:13.873
Don, it's the same plane.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.544
BLAKE: It's supposed to be here.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.945
This is not possible.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.983
DON:
Hey! Hey!

21:24.016 --> 21:26.353
Hey!

21:30.690 --> 21:32.725
It's the exhaust from
the vertical engines.

21:32.759 --> 21:35.762
It must've
burnt the grass.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.764
So he did fly it, then?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.799
Yeah, I guess so.

21:39.832 --> 21:40.967
And where would he take it?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.335
I don't know.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.603
I-I have no idea.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.715
Just because
he's an antiwar activist

21:55.748 --> 21:56.949
doesn't make him a criminal.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.551
Maybe not,
but we're also aware

21:58.585 --> 22:00.353
of his psychiatric history.

22:00.387 --> 22:01.588
As well as his feelings

22:01.621 --> 22:02.722
about the United
States government.

22:02.755 --> 22:03.923
He's not a violent person.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.426
He would never do anything
to intentionally harm someone.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.861
Why didn't he tell you
about the flight that night?

22:08.895 --> 22:11.764
You don't know
his intentions, Blake.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.866
A lot of innocent
people could be hurt.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.602
You understand
what I'm saying?

22:15.635 --> 22:16.636
He wasn't supposed to fly it.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.638
Not yet. We-we were
still testing the rudder.

22:18.671 --> 22:19.906
So he talked to
you about it?

22:19.939 --> 22:21.841
No. Something must've happened.

22:21.874 --> 22:22.909
What do you mean?

22:22.942 --> 22:24.110
- What, a crash?
- No, no.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.745
He's much too good of a pilot
for that.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.580
Then what?

22:27.614 --> 22:28.915
You have to understand,

22:28.948 --> 22:30.650
my father's in a race
for the history books.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.618
- Uh-huh.
- Okay?

22:31.651 --> 22:34.587
An obsession like that
makes you do things

22:34.621 --> 22:36.623
that-that you wouldn't,

22:36.656 --> 22:37.757
and that
you normally couldn't.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.059
What? Like what?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.394
What he's doing is very
expensive.

22:41.428 --> 22:42.629
Uh-huh.

22:42.662 --> 22:45.097
The materials, the tests,
the designs.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.633
We don't have
that type of money.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.602
So, where'd the money
for all this come from?

22:49.636 --> 22:52.405
He sold an interest in his plane
to a venture capital firm.

22:52.439 --> 22:53.139
Which one?

22:53.172 --> 22:55.542
Ridenauer Investments.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.944
It's a German company.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.512
He was never happy
with the arrangement.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.980
He always thought
that they were less interested

23:01.013 --> 23:02.582
in the history books
and more interested

23:02.615 --> 23:03.750
in what the technology
might do for them.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.563
According
to corporate records,

23:16.596 --> 23:18.498
your company
has put almost

23:18.531 --> 23:21.501
$1.7 million
into Gosnell's work so far.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.702
What can I say?

23:22.735 --> 23:26.138
We're a venture capital firm
who just got bit by the bug.

23:26.172 --> 23:30.076
The promise of the mass
production of personal aircraft.

23:30.109 --> 23:33.212
Right. But it doesn't
look like your investors

23:33.245 --> 23:34.981
have much to show for it.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.484
Better a few years too early,
then a few too late, ja?

23:37.517 --> 23:41.488
Besides, if Mr. Gosnell ever
gets his plane up in the air,

23:41.521 --> 23:45.592
our share of the prize
offered by Nordell Aeronautics

23:45.625 --> 23:49.496
more than makes for a very good
hedge on our investment, no?

23:49.529 --> 23:51.998
Gosnell already got his plane
in the air.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.801
What are you talking about?

23:54.834 --> 23:57.236
The unidentified aircraft
that was recently in the news.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.939
The one spotted
over downtown Los Angeles.

23:59.972 --> 24:03.610
You didn't know how far along
he was with his project.

24:03.643 --> 24:08.848
Uh, Gosnell began refusing us
any access to his workshop

24:08.881 --> 24:11.017
over three months ago.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.553
Which means you knew where
his workshop was located, then?

24:15.655 --> 24:19.526
I also noticed
the source of your investments

24:19.559 --> 24:20.527
come from overseas.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.161
What difference
does that make?

24:22.194 --> 24:24.497
Well, I was just wondering
if your motivation

24:24.531 --> 24:26.566
is less the production
of personal aircraft

24:26.599 --> 24:28.701
and more the sale
of Gosnell's technology

24:28.735 --> 24:30.136
to your foreign investors.

24:30.169 --> 24:33.039
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.575
Mr. Ridenauer, if this plane
is used to harm anyone,

24:35.608 --> 24:39.512
you will find yourself
facing serious charges.

24:42.749 --> 24:45.151
There were rumors.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.786
What sort of rumors?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.721
That Gosnell
was getting very close

24:48.755 --> 24:50.189
to creating
a working prototype.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.024
But he wasn't
letting anyone see it.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.661
And naturally, you felt
obligated to pass

24:54.694 --> 24:57.564
that information along
to your foreign investors.

25:04.971 --> 25:08.307
Amita... you know, I didn't
think you could make this work.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.710
But you've come up
with a novel approach

25:10.743 --> 25:12.612
to solve this problem.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.947
Spent six months
getting nowhere

25:14.981 --> 25:16.248
until I thought...

25:16.282 --> 25:17.750
if you can't
come in the front door,

25:17.784 --> 25:19.318
climb through a window.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.754
( laughs )

25:21.788 --> 25:24.657
Well, you've obviously,
certainly,

25:24.691 --> 25:27.093
come a long way in
your thesis work.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.861
Thank you.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.764
You know
what the weird thing is?

25:31.798 --> 25:33.099
- What's that?
- Well, I realized

25:33.132 --> 25:36.903
how much I enjoy
being here at CalSci.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.270
That's good.
I'm glad to hear that.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.773
Well, I was hoping
you'd say that, because

25:40.807 --> 25:44.176
I'm seriously considering
getting a second PhD.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.614
In astrophysics.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.616
No. Don't do that.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.584
Don't tell me I've
been working with you

25:51.618 --> 25:53.152
for over two years
on combinatorics,

25:53.185 --> 25:56.989
and you're just going to throw
that all away for physics.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.625
Charlie, astrophysics
and computer science

25:58.658 --> 25:59.926
make a pretty good match.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.194
- Mm.
- Besides,

26:02.228 --> 26:06.733
I've really realized
how much I like being here.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.735
So you'd do your work here?

26:08.768 --> 26:12.772
Of course,
I'd have a different advisor.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.708
Of course.

26:15.742 --> 26:19.145
Which means that I wouldn't
be your student anymore.

26:19.178 --> 26:21.981
I guess that's true,
isn't it?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.719
ERICA:
Dr. Eppes.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.320
I'd like... Uh, sorry.

26:28.354 --> 26:29.822
Is this a bad time?

26:29.856 --> 26:31.658
No. No, no, no,
not anymore.

26:31.691 --> 26:32.825
What's up?

26:32.859 --> 26:33.993
What have you got?

26:34.026 --> 26:35.394
We found the location

26:35.427 --> 26:37.797
where the plane took off from,
and we have a suspect.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.098
But we haven't been able
to find him

26:39.131 --> 26:40.800
or the plane.

26:40.833 --> 26:41.634
Also, your brother thinks that

26:41.668 --> 26:42.935
this man may not be
in this alone.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.036
Really?

26:44.070 --> 26:46.973
There were foreign investors
in Gosnell's aircraft,

26:47.006 --> 26:48.140
so there's a possibility

26:48.174 --> 26:51.644
this technology could end up
in the hands of a country

26:51.678 --> 26:53.012
that's hostile
towards the United States.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.180
What's this?

26:54.213 --> 26:55.982
Weather radar
of the Los Angeles area

26:56.015 --> 26:57.183
the night
the plane disappeared.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.350
Weather radar?

26:58.384 --> 27:00.019
We know that the plane
wasn't picked up

27:00.052 --> 27:01.821
by conventional
air traffic radar.

27:01.854 --> 27:04.056
Probably because
the material it was made out of

27:04.090 --> 27:05.758
didn't have enough metal in it.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.226
And that's what
traditional radars

27:07.259 --> 27:08.394
are designed to
pick up-- metal.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.797
Right, 'cause that's what
most airplanes are made of.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.832
But the weather radar will show
us locations

27:12.865 --> 27:14.767
of cloud formations,

27:14.801 --> 27:17.136
because it's tuned
to detect water vapor.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.739
So, by re-tuning
the radar signal...

27:19.772 --> 27:21.974
We might be able to track
the path of the plane.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.375
Because this time,

27:23.409 --> 27:25.878
the radar won't be looking
for vapor or metal.

27:25.912 --> 27:28.647
It'll be looking
for something in between.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.777
I called the
State Department

27:57.810 --> 27:58.978
with a list of
Ridenauer's investors.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.180
They're trying to track down
their whereabouts right now,

28:01.213 --> 28:02.782
see if any of them
are in the country.

28:02.815 --> 28:03.582
- All right, that sounds good.
- Don.

28:03.615 --> 28:05.818
- We found it.
- What, the plane?

28:05.852 --> 28:08.254
We re-tuned radar to look
for nonmetallic materials.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.421
We found a new flight path.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.090
- We know where the plane went.
- Where?

28:11.123 --> 28:13.059
Should be within
a quarter-mile area

28:13.092 --> 28:14.326
- in Signal Hill.
- Right.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.428
Okay. Let's go.
Get on the phone to LAPD.

28:16.462 --> 28:17.997
Tell them we need
Search and Rescue teams.

28:18.030 --> 28:18.697
I'm on it.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.474
( helicopter blades whirring)

28:35.147 --> 28:37.349
( officer speaking
indistinctly )

28:41.387 --> 28:44.123
No sign of Gosnell
or the plane.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.524
Charlie, I mean,

28:45.557 --> 28:46.793
are you sure about
the location?

28:46.826 --> 28:48.494
- The math is right.
- All right.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.462
I mean, I'll see if I can

28:50.496 --> 28:51.563
get some more people out here,
but...

28:51.597 --> 28:53.332
Well, maybe we should be
considering the possibility

28:53.365 --> 28:55.534
that the plane might be hidden
in plain sight.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.836
How do you mean?

28:56.869 --> 28:58.237
Kind of like
the Gary DeVore case.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.406
Oh, yeah. This guy
that just disappeared

29:00.439 --> 29:02.108
- driving back from Vegas.
- Right.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.475
And then some months later,

29:03.509 --> 29:06.112
they find him in his car
buried under 20 feet of water.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.080
Just yards away
from where the Highway Patrol

29:08.114 --> 29:09.916
were looking for him.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.326
CHARLIE: Right. Gosnell's plane
could be right in front of us

29:20.359 --> 29:22.862
yet be in an environment that's
preventing us from detecting it.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.163
It's like Charlie said.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.364
Look. I mean, if he went down,

29:25.397 --> 29:28.267
here's a place it'd be pretty
hard to find any wreckage.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.102
A junk yard.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.905
A place already
full of wreckage.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.315
( indistinct voices )

29:55.895 --> 29:57.496
( machinery creaking )

30:11.243 --> 30:13.045
Hey, guys!

30:13.079 --> 30:14.080
Over here!

30:14.113 --> 30:15.147
She found
something...

30:20.086 --> 30:21.888
Don.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.856
It's Lane Gosnell.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.295
He's dead.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.268
DON:
You find anything?

30:36.302 --> 30:38.871
Yeah, the rudder controls show
evidence of being tampered with.

30:38.905 --> 30:39.738
- It was?
- Mm-hmm.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.640
- Tampering? You sure?
- No question.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.376
The box holding the rudder servo
controller was unsealed.

30:44.410 --> 30:45.878
The mechanism was altered.

30:45.912 --> 30:48.614
The plane went down
as a result of sabotage.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.987
- Want me to talk to him?
- No, I got it.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.122
Blake?

30:56.155 --> 30:57.957
All right, Blake...

30:57.990 --> 31:00.226
Was that him?
Was that my Dad?

31:00.259 --> 31:01.994
I'm sorry.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.900
Can you tell me
if he suffered?

31:07.934 --> 31:09.501
We're pretty sure
he died on impact.

31:12.038 --> 31:12.871
How does this happen?

31:12.905 --> 31:13.973
How does something
like this happen?

31:14.006 --> 31:17.977
Well, see, the thing is, it-it
wasn't an accident.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.946
What?

31:19.979 --> 31:21.580
Apparently, the rudder
was tampered with.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.982
The rudder?

31:24.116 --> 31:26.385
Your father was murdered.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.354
I'm sorry.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.594
All right, so,
Lane Gosnell

31:35.627 --> 31:38.998
was definitely killed
by an act of sabotage.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.933
Yeah, but by who, and why?

31:40.967 --> 31:43.435
Well, I mean, working theory has
to assume the worst, right?

31:43.469 --> 31:46.038
I mean, it has to be because of
what that technology could do.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.940
Just got a preliminary analysis

31:47.974 --> 31:49.708
of Gosnell's flight
data record.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.642
Mm-hmm?

31:50.676 --> 31:51.643
Apparently, because Gosnell
didn't know

31:51.677 --> 31:54.013
about the rudder problem,
he over-corrected,

31:54.046 --> 31:55.982
put the craft into
an uncontrolled dive.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.116
He wasn't able
to recover.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.617
Any chance
that flight recorder

31:58.650 --> 32:00.119
can tell us
where he was headed?

32:00.152 --> 32:02.221
Not without a
filed flight plan.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.622
Most of the data
on the recorder

32:03.655 --> 32:04.556
is just pretty
basic information

32:04.590 --> 32:07.259
about changes in his
speed and altitude.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.194
So, you can't even tell us

32:08.227 --> 32:10.229
the Staples Center
was his intended target?

32:10.262 --> 32:11.630
You can't eliminate
it, either.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.299
Because of the sabotage,

32:13.332 --> 32:15.301
the rudder wasn't
behaving as expected,

32:15.334 --> 32:20.006
so we can't tell what his
true course might've been.

32:20.039 --> 32:23.675
I mean, so, he took the plane up
for what that night? A joy ride?

32:23.709 --> 32:25.477
Wasn't the impression I got
from his ex-partner.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.646
Croft was pretty sure
that Gosnell intended

32:27.679 --> 32:29.248
to try something
spectacular.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.250
What do you hear
from the State Department?

32:31.283 --> 32:32.618
So far, they've come up
empty-handed.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.720
None of Ridenauer's investors
are in the country.

32:34.753 --> 32:36.222
Doesn't mean they don't have
people here

32:36.255 --> 32:37.156
working on their behalf.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.597
Hey, Charlie.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.665
- Hey.
- What's up?

32:46.698 --> 32:49.135
Just grading tests
for my Nonlinear Dynamics class.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.337
Glad to see you're
taking my advice

32:51.370 --> 32:52.571
and having some fun.

32:52.604 --> 32:55.641
Well... you don't look like
you've been having too much fun.

32:55.674 --> 32:58.010
( sighing )
Oh, man...

32:58.044 --> 33:00.279
this Gosnell case...

33:00.312 --> 33:03.015
I spent all that time
trying to figure out

33:03.049 --> 33:03.915
where the plane went.

33:03.949 --> 33:05.351
Turns out the pilot
didn't even know,

33:05.384 --> 33:06.718
because the rudder was busted.

33:06.752 --> 33:07.986
See, that's the thing--
I got to find out

33:08.020 --> 33:10.156
where he was headed, 'cause I
think that's why he was killed.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.358
You got any ideas?

33:12.391 --> 33:13.692
Anything at all?

33:13.725 --> 33:15.694
Maybe. Could I, uh...

33:15.727 --> 33:18.197
could I get some data
off the flight recorder?

33:18.230 --> 33:23.202
Yeah, I mean, I can see if, uh,
Erica can drop some by.

33:23.235 --> 33:26.138
Maybe Amita can
help you out.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.275
Dad said she's
sticking around.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.212
Did he?

33:33.245 --> 33:34.580
Well, you happy about that?

33:34.613 --> 33:39.185
Um... are you asking me
as her thesis advisor or...?

33:39.218 --> 33:41.553
( chuckling ):
You tell me.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.157
Yeah, I'm happy.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.294
Hey, what's the deal?

33:48.327 --> 33:49.461
I thought you were
playing golf today.

33:49.495 --> 33:55.734
Oh, no. You know, I'm really
no use on the golf course.

33:55.767 --> 33:59.338
Charlie... you know why
he likes playing with you,

33:59.371 --> 34:00.206
- don't you?
- I have no idea,

34:00.239 --> 34:02.608
because I-I've got to be
the worst golfer

34:02.641 --> 34:03.742
in the history
of the game.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.844
No. It's the one time
he gets to teach you something.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.080
You understand?

34:08.114 --> 34:10.449
That's the one time.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.583
( phone rings )
Oh, excuse me.

34:14.486 --> 34:15.454
Eppes.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.588
Don...

34:16.622 --> 34:19.225
the forensic report from
Gosnell's workshop just came in.

34:19.258 --> 34:22.094
We found David Croft's
fingerprints all over the shop.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.130
But I thought you said
he hadn't seen him in years.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.164
And so he said.

34:25.197 --> 34:28.134
All right, look, uh,
take a team, pick him up.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.435
I'll meet you
at the office, okay?

34:29.468 --> 34:31.537
You got it.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.610
I didn't kill Lane Gosnell.

34:38.644 --> 34:41.280
But you were pretty pissed
at him, right?

34:41.313 --> 34:43.282
I've been pretty angry
at Lane Gosnell

34:43.315 --> 34:45.251
for over ten years.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.485
Because he stole
your design.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.619
Is that why
you led us to think

34:47.653 --> 34:49.288
he was planning something
pretty big?

34:49.321 --> 34:50.756
All I said was

34:50.789 --> 34:52.124
that it was in Lane's nature

34:52.158 --> 34:54.126
to do something crazy,
and it was.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.694
Crazier than sabotage, you mean?

34:59.498 --> 35:01.167
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.401
Your prints were found
in his workshop.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.703
If you hadn't seen him in ten
years, how'd they get there?

35:04.736 --> 35:05.704
What was it?

35:05.737 --> 35:06.538
You couldn't
let him win?

35:06.572 --> 35:08.174
- Is that it?
- Okay, look, look,

35:08.207 --> 35:09.475
I-I ran
into Gosnell's kid

35:09.508 --> 35:11.143
at an air show
a few months ago,

35:11.177 --> 35:12.878
and he let slip
that his old man

35:12.911 --> 35:13.679
was getting pretty close

35:13.712 --> 35:15.481
- to a working aircraft.
- Uh-huh.

35:15.514 --> 35:18.650
And I had to see
that plane for myself.

35:18.684 --> 35:19.818
Now, Lane was
a great designer,

35:19.851 --> 35:20.952
but he was an ungrateful
son of a bitch.

35:20.986 --> 35:24.223
He just could never acknowledge
anyone's contribution.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.158
For ten years, I worked
on that design.

35:26.192 --> 35:27.092
So you went
into his workshop?

35:27.125 --> 35:30.329
Look, I know you think
I killed Gosnell.

35:30.362 --> 35:31.330
I know you're thinking that.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.599
- Yeah.
- But not this way.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.368
I could've never touched
that airplane.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.305
Not ever.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.174
Don't you understand?

35:42.208 --> 35:45.844
As much as that airplane
was Lane's,

35:45.877 --> 35:47.913
it was mine, too.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.524
Tell me how this works.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.859
A servo is basically
an automatic device

36:00.892 --> 36:02.761
used to control
large amounts of power

36:02.794 --> 36:03.862
with small amounts
of power.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.865
What happens is the pilot moves
the flight controls,

36:06.898 --> 36:08.834
the servo translates
those movements to the rudder.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.370
And where was
the tampering done?

36:11.403 --> 36:16.875
Three places: amplifier,
actuator and feedback element.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.945
Why would somebody break
three things instead of one?

36:24.250 --> 36:26.285
Have you considered

36:26.318 --> 36:29.288
maybe... whomever it was...

36:29.321 --> 36:31.957
wasn't trying to break it?

36:33.292 --> 36:35.394
They were trying to fix it.

36:35.427 --> 36:36.895
Don. Hey.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.897
We think we know
who tampered with that servo.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.232
Great. Who?

36:40.266 --> 36:41.600
Well, we don't have
a name.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.402
What-what are
you talking about?

36:43.435 --> 36:45.537
Do you know
who did it or not?

36:45.571 --> 36:47.005
The rudder
wasn't sabotage.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.374
Right-- it
wasn't sabotage

36:48.407 --> 36:49.741
in the traditional sense
of the word.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.410
Now, we assumed
because the plane crashed

36:51.443 --> 36:53.345
that someone was trying
to cause it to crash,

36:53.379 --> 36:54.346
but maybe that's wrong.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.315
Yeah? What do you mean?

36:56.348 --> 36:58.417
Well, what if the adjustments
were actually intended

36:58.450 --> 37:00.419
to be design improvements?

37:00.452 --> 37:02.254
Improvements?

37:02.288 --> 37:04.356
But you said the flight recorder
clearly showed

37:04.390 --> 37:06.292
that Gosnell didn't know
anyone messed with the rudder.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.659
CHARLIE: Doesn't disprove my
theory.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.295
It merely eliminates Gosnell

37:09.328 --> 37:10.962
as the person
who made the improvements.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.437
I was hoping to hear
from you guys soon.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.606
Have you made
any progress?

37:20.639 --> 37:22.308
Actually, yes.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.276
So do you know
who did it, then?

37:24.310 --> 37:26.278
We're still waiting
on final fingerprint analysis,

37:26.312 --> 37:28.947
but, uh, we have
a pretty good idea.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.283
Well, can
you tell me?

37:31.317 --> 37:34.420
Why don't you
tell us, Blake?

37:39.458 --> 37:40.759
Uh, I don't know
what you mean.

37:40.792 --> 37:41.860
See, the thing is,

37:41.893 --> 37:43.295
I remember the look on your face

37:43.329 --> 37:44.496
when we walked
in your father's workshop

37:44.530 --> 37:45.697
and that plane wasn't there.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.799
And the first thing you wanted
to know at the crash site

37:47.833 --> 37:49.301
wasn't what happened
to the plane

37:49.335 --> 37:51.770
but was whether your father
had suffered.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.339
You didn't have to ask
about the plane

37:53.372 --> 37:54.673
'cause you knew why it crashed.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.479
Whose fingerprints are we going
to find on that servo, Blake?

38:03.682 --> 38:05.651
I was just trying
to make improvements.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.086
That's all.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.356
You should've told him you
changed the design, right?

38:10.389 --> 38:11.990
- No, he wouldn't have listened.
- No?

38:12.023 --> 38:13.825
No, I could never tell him.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.827
He'd just remove it.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.997
The man was
so sure...

38:19.030 --> 38:21.367
He was so sure
that I could never do

38:21.400 --> 38:22.501
the things that he could.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.969
And you wanted
to show him

38:24.002 --> 38:26.037
that you were good enough
to carry on his work,

38:26.071 --> 38:27.038
carry on his legacy?

38:27.072 --> 38:29.841
He wanted to be the first.

38:29.875 --> 38:32.478
He wanted to be
the next Henry Ford.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.479
You know what I mean?

38:33.512 --> 38:36.448
Yeah, I think
I follow you.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.417
Do you have any idea

38:38.450 --> 38:40.686
what it's like
to live like that?

38:40.719 --> 38:43.855
To know that your father cares
more for his accomplishments

38:43.889 --> 38:45.791
than he does for his own son?

38:45.824 --> 38:47.793
I mean, I wonder
if for one second,

38:47.826 --> 38:50.362
I entered his mind that night.

38:50.396 --> 38:54.032
I wonder if he thought that...

38:54.065 --> 38:56.034
that I might want to be there...

38:56.067 --> 38:58.670
to share that moment with him.

39:00.439 --> 39:03.108
Guess I'll
never know.

39:08.414 --> 39:09.681
- Where's Chuck?
- I don't know.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.717
Last I looked,
he was right behind us.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.818
There he is.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.586
CHARLIE:
Hey, Dad.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.422
Your clubs weigh a ton.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.424
Are you kidding? I've used
those clubs for ten years.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.558
There's nothing wrong with them.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.992
Dad, they're older than he is.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.629
I don't even think
they make wood clubs anymore.

39:23.662 --> 39:24.663
Yeah, I know,

39:24.696 --> 39:26.532
but each one of 'em's got
a great sweet spot.

39:26.565 --> 39:27.633
DON: We'll put 'em in a museum.

39:27.666 --> 39:28.900
ALAN: Eh, when Charlie gets
better,

39:28.934 --> 39:30.101
I'll buy him a
set of his own.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.471
Come on, Charlie, maybe this is
the day you'll par a hole.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.740
I'd just like to get
the ball in the hole.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.174
That's all.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.910
Hey, Charlie.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.612
Charlie, maybe, uh,

39:40.646 --> 39:42.414
if you're getting
that frustrated,

39:42.448 --> 39:44.683
there's always something else
we could do together, you know.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.918
Actually, you know what?

39:46.952 --> 39:48.787
I love golf.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.423
You see, huh?

39:51.457 --> 39:53.024
( both chuckling )

39:53.058 --> 39:54.826
I knew it would grow on you
once you gave it a chance.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.563
Well, what can I say?
You're a great teacher.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.438
All right, Alan.

40:06.472 --> 40:08.073
Show us how it's done.

40:09.475 --> 40:09.541
ALAN:
Oh, yeah!
