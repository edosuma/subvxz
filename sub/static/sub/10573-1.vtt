I promise. I'll take
care of everything.

17:47.395 --> 17:50.629
I'll just call
a doctor or a...

17:50.631 --> 17:52.364
Veterinarian.

17:52.366 --> 17:54.666
Oh, no, no. No.
I'm sorry.

17:54.668 --> 17:58.536
I mean, I'm...Married.

17:58.538 --> 18:01.572
Um, not married.
I'm engaged, which is--

18:01.574 --> 18:07.110
you know, it's, uh,
just as bad.

18:07.112 --> 18:11.681
I mean,
I'm dreaming.

18:11.683 --> 18:13.683
I mean,
I must be dreaming,
and if I'm dreaming,

18:13.685 --> 18:15.685
then there's nothing
to feel guilty
about, right?

18:15.687 --> 18:22.091
So, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

I don't
believe this.

19:56.446 --> 19:59.380
I know. I know.
I overslept.

19:59.382 --> 20:02.883
Hope you had
pleasant dreams.

20:02.885 --> 20:04.384
Well, as a matter
of fact--

20:04.386 --> 20:06.219
Jim, this
isn't funny.

20:06.221 --> 20:08.421
Daddy is furious
over last night.

20:08.423 --> 20:10.756
Honey, I thought
I explained everything
when I called.

20:10.758 --> 20:12.691
Yeah. You also said
that you would be over

20:12.693 --> 20:14.225
first thing
in the morning

20:14.227 --> 20:15.659
with an apology
for him.

20:15.661 --> 20:18.395
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

20:18.397 --> 20:22.165
All right. Well, I
should at least call him
and tell him that you--

20:22.167 --> 20:23.366
uh, no, no, no.

20:23.368 --> 20:26.402
Actually, the place
is a little messy

20:26.404 --> 20:28.470
from last night.

20:28.472 --> 20:30.638
Actually,
more than a bit.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.674
I don't think
you want to see this.

20:33.676 --> 20:35.275
Ok. All right.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.442
So, we'll see you
in half an hour.

20:36.444 --> 20:39.344
Ok.
Ok, and, Jim,
please, don't be late.

20:39.346 --> 20:41.612
There's some sort
of problem going on
at the company,

20:41.614 --> 20:43.547
and daddy is in
a real poo-poo mood.

20:43.549 --> 20:46.283
Ok. I promise
I'll hurry.

20:46.285 --> 20:49.452
Ok.
All right.

20:52.890 --> 20:56.324
Thanks, guys.

21:00.329 --> 21:02.262
Ha ha ha!

21:02.264 --> 21:04.464
You guys don't think

21:04.466 --> 21:07.266
she was just a tad
angry with us, do you?

21:07.268 --> 21:09.468
Nah.
Nah.

Come on,

Come on, Sanders!

on the throne.

Hi.
Hey.

22:26.534 --> 22:28.534
What's going on?

22:28.536 --> 22:30.702
You tell us.

22:30.704 --> 22:31.969
I was
just leaving.

22:31.971 --> 22:33.670
I'm gonna go
meet up with Patty.

22:33.672 --> 22:35.572
Yeah. We
just saw her.

22:35.573 --> 22:37.473
Great gal,
not even remotely
upset about last night.

22:37.475 --> 22:39.641
Oh, yeah? Terrific.
Well, listen, guys.

22:39.643 --> 22:40.908
I'm in a bit of a hurry,
so do me a favor.

22:40.910 --> 22:42.676
Why don't you
walk me out, ok?
Come on.

22:42.678 --> 22:45.111
Well, we came over
to help you
clean up.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.813
Is this open?
No.

22:46.814 --> 22:48.514
No. That's all right.
I got everything, anyway.

22:48.516 --> 22:51.517
Oh, ok. Well, gee,
we really wanted
to help you, Jim.

22:51.519 --> 22:53.418
Maybe we can
come back later.
No!

No!
Wait, guys!

23:13.903 --> 23:16.370
I don't get it.

23:16.372 --> 23:17.738
Neither do I.

23:17.740 --> 23:22.609
I mean, what did you jerks
expect to find, huh?

23:22.611 --> 23:24.944
You think that, um--

23:25.546 --> 23:27.479
ha ha ha! Yes!

23:27.481 --> 23:29.814
No, no, no, no.

think it is, George.

It's really, really
important that you listen
to me right now, ok?

went on a love frenzy
last night.

will you stop it?

George, please,
it's really important you
listen to me right now, ok?

something that is simply
gonna amaze you.

Patty, right, guys?

23:45.463 --> 23:47.213
George, please.

23:47.214 --> 23:48.964
I don't know whether I
should go for the year's
supply of canned ham

23:48.966 --> 23:51.166
or what's behind
curtain number 3.

23:51.168 --> 23:54.536
George, I'm begging you.
It's important.

23:54.538 --> 23:57.038
Curtain
number 3.
Canned ham.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.973
Bob, I'm going
for the curtain.

23:58.975 --> 24:04.912
Yeah! Open
that curtain!
No!

24:16.758 --> 24:20.558
Who is she?

24:21.961 --> 24:24.728

that's an angel.

time for this.

24:42.209 --> 24:43.541
We got to get
back there.

24:43.543 --> 24:45.276
We never should've
left her alone.

24:45.277 --> 24:47.010
You'll feel better
after we get you
something to eat.

for the scam that...

every day.

about trademark and copyrights?

to law school.

guys, is, we have
to move rapid, quick.

25:10.933 --> 25:12.198
Once that wing
heals, she's gone.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.999
I just want to make sure
we don't get ripped off.

25:14.001 --> 25:15.633

the ninth wonder
of the world."

I'm not gonna turn her into
some kind of sideshow freak.

I didn't even think
about sideshows.

25:34.184 --> 25:37.018

Look. She's hurt, ok?

25:37.020 --> 25:38.953

cared for.

to be on decoy.

for us tonight.

I can't believe
I'm wasting time
with you maniacs.

alone in the first place.

She's an angel.

26:00.173 --> 26:02.540
She doesn't belong
in a circus,

26:02.541 --> 26:04.908
so if you don't want
to help me, then fine.
No problem.

26:04.911 --> 26:08.012

of it myself.

around you like that.

Is that better?

26:39.076 --> 26:42.677
No. Ahem. No.

don't you think?

so, this is why you
didn't want me coming in
before, huh?

It's not what
you think it is.

were honest with me.

tell you?

a second.

to be afraid.

your last confession?

a catholic, son?

No. No, sir. I've never
been here before.

where to take her.

Hmm.

brought her here

figuring maybe you folks
would know what to do
with her.

of her, and I don't want
to see her exploited,

and 8 our fathers

act of contrition.

I don't know what
those things are.

43:55.226 --> 43:56.825
Sit!

43:57.260 --> 43:58.592
Stop!

43:58.594 --> 44:00.126
[Barking]

44:00.128 --> 44:02.061
Aaah!

44:02.063 --> 44:04.996
[Shouting indistinctly]

44:07.767 --> 44:10.234
[Chomp]
Owwwaah!

44:10.236 --> 44:13.070
Had enough!

[Squealing]

44:53.740 --> 44:56.407
Ha. Hello.

44:57.042 --> 45:00.009
Is something the matter?
I mean...

45:00.011 --> 45:02.344
Don't you sleep?

45:04.414 --> 45:06.064
Uh, no, I--

45:06.065 --> 45:07.715
do you remember
the girl?
The girl--Patty?

45:07.717 --> 45:09.883
Well, we're gonna
get married.

45:09.885 --> 45:14.087
I mean, it's not like
I don't wanna go
with you, but--

45:14.089 --> 45:15.154
look, tomorrow,
I promise.

45:15.156 --> 45:16.622
We'll figure
everything out, ok?

45:16.623 --> 45:18.089
I mean, we'll find out
where you belong

45:18.092 --> 45:19.891
and who you are.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.159
Ok?

45:47.786 --> 45:50.153
Woman: Winston's
cosmetics.
Man: Well, I heard...

45:50.155 --> 45:51.888
Second man: Yeah, I heard
they may go under.

45:51.890 --> 45:54.991
I'll transfer you.
Thank you.

45:54.993 --> 45:56.726
Winston's cosmetics.

45:56.728 --> 45:57.793
Aldridge,
we all know

45:57.795 --> 45:59.795
the test results
on the ethereal line,

45:59.797 --> 46:01.963
and I for one don't want
to hear them anymore.

46:01.965 --> 46:04.765
The question that we are
here to answer is

46:04.767 --> 46:06.900
what was at fault?

46:06.902 --> 46:09.135
Why did it fail?

46:09.137 --> 46:11.170
Who are we gonna blame?

46:11.172 --> 46:14.806
Uh...The advertising
campaign was

46:14.808 --> 46:17.008
poorly conceived, sir?

46:20.179 --> 46:21.178
I agree.

46:21.180 --> 46:22.529
[All sigh]

46:22.530 --> 46:23.879
Right. We can
teller and gillette

46:23.882 --> 46:25.915
and we start again.
Agreed?

46:25.917 --> 46:28.484
Uh, Mr. Winston,
excuse me, but

46:28.486 --> 46:30.819
isn't the situation
far more crucial

46:30.821 --> 46:32.020
than just changing
ad agencies?

46:32.022 --> 46:33.955
I mean, doesn't
the whole future

46:33.957 --> 46:35.823
of Winston's cosmetics
depend on--

46:35.825 --> 46:38.091
now, that
is not true!

46:39.828 --> 46:42.128
I want these rumors squashed.

46:42.130 --> 46:45.231
This company is
in perfectly capable--oh!

46:45.233 --> 46:47.333
[Shouting indistinctly]

46:49.337 --> 46:51.070
Excuse me.

46:51.906 --> 46:54.172
I don't know
if you all know, but

46:54.174 --> 46:57.275
I was attacked last night.

46:57.277 --> 47:00.011
We're sorry
to hear that, sir.

47:00.847 --> 47:01.946
It was worth it.

47:01.948 --> 47:04.214
For what
I discovered...

47:05.016 --> 47:07.950
I found a face to die for.

47:07.952 --> 47:11.887
A complexion
that every female on earth

47:11.889 --> 47:14.056
would sell her soul for.

47:14.057 --> 47:16.224
I'm telling you, this girl
is the ethereal beauty.

47:16.226 --> 47:18.426
With her, we could
go international.

47:18.428 --> 47:22.763
She is everything
we could ever hope for.

47:22.765 --> 47:23.964
That sounds great,
Mr. Winston.

47:23.966 --> 47:25.999
We're behind you
200%, sir.

47:26.001 --> 47:28.201
Yeah. Who is
this girl?

47:28.336 --> 47:31.537
My daughter's
fiance's mistress.

47:36.176 --> 47:40.311
Are you sure
we can get her, sir?

47:40.313 --> 47:42.246
Oh, we'll get her.

47:43.315 --> 47:45.381
I will definitely get her.

47:45.383 --> 47:49.051
Uh, what about
your daughter, sir?

47:49.053 --> 47:51.353
This is business, aldridge.

47:51.355 --> 47:55.023
Ed Winston's daughter
will understand.

47:55.025 --> 47:56.725
Get out!

47:56.726 --> 47:58.426
I don't want
to hear any more.

47:58.427 --> 48:00.127
Now, wait, wait, wait.
Now, just think about
the good...

48:00.130 --> 48:01.229
Aah!
Look, once I get

48:01.231 --> 48:02.781
this girl working
and out of the way,

48:02.782 --> 48:04.332
you and Jim
are gonna be free
to get back together.

48:04.334 --> 48:05.800
I'll give you
a tremendous wedding.

48:05.802 --> 48:08.502
Aah! Just leave me
alone!

48:08.504 --> 48:10.303
I hate you.

48:10.305 --> 48:13.239
Oh, you don't
care about me.

48:13.241 --> 48:14.406
Who defended you

48:14.408 --> 48:15.807
when you were
having affairs

48:15.809 --> 48:18.342
on my mother,
who lied
for you!

48:18.344 --> 48:21.478
Nothing better
to do with your
stupid pension.

48:21.480 --> 48:22.512
All right,
now, pattycat,

48:22.514 --> 48:24.480
let's not hurt
each other here.

48:24.482 --> 48:26.148
Uhh!

48:26.150 --> 48:29.451
Aah!
[Crash]

48:29.453 --> 48:32.954
Well, that's just
unavoidable, isn't it?

48:32.956 --> 48:37.458
Oh! How am I gonna face
anyone now?

48:37.460 --> 48:40.828
[Sobbing, hiccuping]

48:40.830 --> 48:42.095
Do you hear that?

48:42.097 --> 48:45.865
I'm hiccuping now!
[Hiccups]

49:01.148 --> 49:02.914
[Squealing]

49:04.350 --> 49:06.016
Here. Put this on.

49:06.018 --> 49:07.484
Take it.

49:08.487 --> 49:10.920
[Mumbling]

49:15.926 --> 49:17.258
That's right.

49:17.260 --> 49:19.193
Ok.
[Squealing]

49:19.261 --> 49:20.493
All right.
Good going.

49:20.495 --> 49:23.629
It's ok.
One after
the other one.

49:28.602 --> 49:30.935
[Squealing]
Sorry.

49:31.237 --> 49:33.203
Man: All right, boys.
That's the last
of the paperwork.

49:33.205 --> 49:35.905
Copyright and trademark.
That's all you need.

49:35.907 --> 49:37.006
Show me what you got.

49:37.007 --> 49:38.106
You're going to want
to sit down for this.

49:38.109 --> 49:39.358
This stuff is great.

49:39.359 --> 49:40.608
...wash over you.
Just let it
open your mind.

49:40.611 --> 49:42.143
Open your mind.
At the beach.

49:42.145 --> 49:43.444
Ok, look at this,
look at this.

49:43.446 --> 49:45.613
Official angel halo.

49:45.615 --> 49:48.248
See? Angel cola.
Angel cola.

49:48.250 --> 49:49.482
Everyone drinks cola.

49:49.484 --> 49:52.318
[All talking at once]

49:53.487 --> 49:57.388
The official
"I love the angel"
bumper sticker.

49:57.390 --> 49:58.489
Yeah! A buck apiece.

49:58.491 --> 49:59.690
We'll sell millions
of them.

49:59.692 --> 50:01.525
An-gel.
An-gel.

50:01.527 --> 50:03.593
Do you get it,
man? Gel.

Jim: Good.

51:33.489 --> 51:34.605
Yeah, keep your hands
to your side.

51:34.607 --> 51:36.540
You just--step--
wonderful. No problem.

51:36.542 --> 51:38.275
Don't worry.
When Patty sees
what you are,

51:38.277 --> 51:40.644
she's--she's gonna
love you.

51:42.247 --> 51:43.746
Hi, honey!

51:44.715 --> 51:46.414
Patty?

51:46.416 --> 51:48.115
Just--wait.

51:48.117 --> 51:51.651
Patty, please.
Please, sweetheart,
don't--

51:52.220 --> 51:54.653
just don't overreact.
Let me--

51:54.655 --> 51:57.188
please let me explain,
ok?

Patty?

52:03.095 --> 52:04.527
Ok, honey?
You know what?

52:04.529 --> 52:08.197
If you don't believe me,
see for yourself.

52:08.199 --> 52:09.364
They say seeing
is believing.

52:09.366 --> 52:11.566
Well, you're not
gonna believe this.

52:11.568 --> 52:15.503
You're not gonna
believe this, sweetheart.
You're--

52:15.505 --> 52:18.172
aw, come on.
Give me a break.

52:18.174 --> 52:21.308
Patty, come on.
Shut off the--

52:22.244 --> 52:24.777
Patricia, these are not
the actions

52:24.779 --> 52:27.679
of a person involved
in a relationship

52:27.681 --> 52:30.181
based upon commitment.

52:30.183 --> 52:33.150

You've got it all wrong.

53:09.781 --> 53:11.681
She means nothing
to me. Nothing.

Woman on TV:
Nothing. Ha!

53:13.484 --> 53:15.284
I don't hear from you
for 3 days, tad.

53:15.286 --> 53:17.152
You didn't even call...
Yeah.

53:17.154 --> 53:18.531
Patty!
Oh, thank God.

53:18.532 --> 53:19.909
Look, please, please,
don't hang up the phone.

53:19.910 --> 53:21.287
Just listen to me.
I know you're furious, but

53:21.291 --> 53:22.556
I-I-I found her
in my pool.

53:22.558 --> 53:24.224
I-I mean--
[Indistinct]

53:24.226 --> 53:25.558
I-I fell asleep
and I woke up

53:25.560 --> 53:27.660
and there was this noise
and I went outside--

53:27.662 --> 53:30.429

[Laughs]
Yes, of course, sir.

54:25.240 --> 54:26.723
I mean, if I heard,
you know,

54:26.724 --> 54:28.207
if I heard this,
I would think
it was crazy, too,

54:28.209 --> 54:30.609
but I swear this is
on the level.

54:30.611 --> 54:31.910
So you--
oh, oh, wow.

54:31.912 --> 54:34.579
So you're coming.
Thank you.

54:34.581 --> 54:38.716
That's tomorrow
at the press club
at noon.

54:38.718 --> 54:41.218
And just come as
you are, you know.

54:41.220 --> 54:42.686
Just dress casually.

54:42.688 --> 54:44.387
We'll be there. Ok.

54:44.389 --> 54:45.988
Great. Bye-bye.

54:46.290 --> 54:48.556
Don, that was
the "daily news."

54:48.558 --> 54:50.357
That's the end
of the list, man.

54:50.359 --> 54:51.458
They're all coming.

54:51.460 --> 54:53.693
Uh, how about all
the TV stations?

54:53.695 --> 54:56.929
All the TV stations.
All the radio
stations.

54:56.931 --> 54:59.731
Tabloids.
The works.

54:59.899 --> 55:01.498
Ain't got the angel.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.533
Now what are we gonna do
about Sanders?

55:03.535 --> 55:04.600
Don't worry
about that.

55:04.602 --> 55:05.834
I've got everything
taken care of.

55:05.836 --> 55:08.303
Do you know what
Jim's problem's
always been?

55:08.305 --> 55:09.904
He never thinks
about himself.

55:09.906 --> 55:12.339
That's why God
created us.

55:12.341 --> 55:13.940
I think when this
whole thing's over,

55:13.942 --> 55:15.241
he's gonna come
running up here

55:15.243 --> 55:16.342
and plant a big,
wet, juicy one

55:16.344 --> 55:17.743
right there
on my cheek
and say,

55:17.745 --> 55:19.478
"George, thank you."

55:19.480 --> 55:20.996
I wouldn't count on it.

55:20.997 --> 55:22.513
I've never seen him
this stubborn.

55:22.516 --> 55:24.015
George: Let's face it.

55:24.017 --> 55:26.917
Jim is a screwed-up
little puppy right now.

55:26.919 --> 55:29.653
Why do you think
he's been having
these headaches,

55:29.655 --> 55:31.621
acting like
a space cadet?

55:31.623 --> 55:33.389
He knows marrying Patty
and that stupid job's

55:33.391 --> 55:35.858
not what he's supposed
to be doing
with his life.

55:35.860 --> 55:36.792
This angel's
the best thing

55:36.794 --> 55:38.326
that could've happened
to him.

55:38.328 --> 55:40.795
So, how are we
gonna get her, ace?

55:40.797 --> 55:44.832
Ha. Once again,
the talented and lovely

55:44.834 --> 55:47.334
miss Patty Winston
will assist us.

55:47.336 --> 55:48.501
What?

55:48.503 --> 55:49.468
How?

55:49.470 --> 55:51.036
Even as we speak,

55:51.038 --> 55:53.505
it's in the works,
gentlemen.

Ok.

01:23:50.357 --> 01:23:54.525

01:23:56.728 --> 01:24:00.596
She's going to be
one sorry slut.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.333
Oh!

01:24:05.335 --> 01:24:09.403
My hat. My hat.

01:24:09.405 --> 01:24:11.371
My hat.

01:24:11.373 --> 01:24:14.273
So want to play tough?

01:24:14.275 --> 01:24:16.275
I can play plenty tough, sister.

Ben: Sorry I didn't
get you out sooner,

01:24:32.121 --> 01:24:33.637
but you know grace.

01:24:33.638 --> 01:24:35.154
George: We understand,
and we'll pay you back,
I promise.

01:24:35.157 --> 01:24:37.441
You boys are the
only ones that can
help me.

01:24:37.442 --> 01:24:39.726
We've got to get
to Jim and the girl
before Winston does.

01:24:39.728 --> 01:24:41.060
Wait. You know
where they are?

01:24:41.062 --> 01:24:42.695
I've got
a pretty good idea.

01:24:42.696 --> 01:24:44.329
Thank goodness
the police aren't
searching the woods

01:24:44.331 --> 01:24:46.364
till morning.

01:24:46.366 --> 01:24:49.200
All: The tree house!

01:24:50.369 --> 01:24:53.103
I'm embarrassed.

01:25:00.277 --> 01:25:03.778
I think this
is gonna work.

01:25:05.381 --> 01:25:10.050
You tell me
if this hurts, ok?

01:25:10.052 --> 01:25:13.086
Just let me know.

01:25:18.092 --> 01:25:22.527
Ok. Now go ahead.
Extend them.

01:25:31.236 --> 01:25:33.202
There it is.

01:25:33.204 --> 01:25:37.206
According to the book,
all your powers
should be restored.

01:25:37.208 --> 01:25:41.276
That means you can--
you can leave.

01:25:41.278 --> 01:25:45.079
I mean, it makes
sense anyway, doesn't it?

01:25:45.081 --> 01:25:46.513
We can't stay here
forever.

01:25:46.515 --> 01:25:48.481
They're gonna
find us eventually.

01:25:48.483 --> 01:25:51.484
When they do,
they'll turn you
into a freak show.

01:25:51.486 --> 01:25:55.821
I'm sorry. I just
don't think I could
take that.

01:25:56.356 --> 01:26:01.659
I think it's better
that you just go back
to where you belong.

01:26:02.094 --> 01:26:04.360
I've got to
go back, too.

01:26:04.362 --> 01:26:07.496

01:26:16.606 --> 01:26:18.238
Yeah, I know.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.308
It's all the more
reason for you to leave.

01:26:22.576 --> 01:26:27.378
I'm afraid down here,
those are a common occurrence.

01:26:28.814 --> 01:26:31.481
Well, it's not gonna
get any easier.

01:26:31.483 --> 01:26:35.218

to the meadow.

01:27:09.815 --> 01:27:11.815
Nope. Gone.

01:27:11.817 --> 01:27:13.750
What do you think?

01:27:13.752 --> 01:27:15.818
I think she's
flown the Coop.

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:18.387

Jim: Come on now.
Don't play around.

01:28:43.635 --> 01:28:45.368
Look, I'm not feeling
too swift,

01:28:45.370 --> 01:28:47.970
and I want to get back.

01:28:48.372 --> 01:28:50.138
Don't do this to me.

01:28:50.139 --> 01:28:51.905
Look, you know how
I feel about you.

01:28:51.908 --> 01:28:54.608
It's just that--

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.752
Thank you.

What happened
to you?

01:29:11.589 --> 01:29:14.923
I regained
my feminine dignity.

01:29:14.925 --> 01:29:20.495
Now, where's
that angel bitch, hmm?

01:29:20.497 --> 01:29:23.531
I guess she's gone.

01:29:23.533 --> 01:29:25.666
I'm sorry.

01:29:25.668 --> 01:29:27.467

you to meet her.

that for hurting you.

I was nowhere
near her.

touch her.
She did it.

Nobody has to get
hurt here.

01:31:16.921 --> 01:31:19.087
You just tell me
where she is,

01:31:19.089 --> 01:31:21.122
and we'll forget
the whole affair.

01:31:21.124 --> 01:31:22.990

ask you again.

only you broke your wing
and messed up your mission, huh?

01:40:12.601 --> 01:40:13.600
He's already--

01:40:13.602 --> 01:40:15.134
woman: No, he isn't,

01:40:15.136 --> 01:40:18.937
and you know you shouldn't
be in here.

01:40:19.272 --> 01:40:21.038
But we have to
tell him something.

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.206
You can do that
tomorrow.

01:40:23.208 --> 01:40:25.241
Now he needs
his rest.

01:40:25.243 --> 01:40:30.379
Well, we thought
that he might
not...

01:40:30.381 --> 01:40:35.183
Don't worry.
Jim's gonna be around
for quite a while.

01:40:35.185 --> 01:40:39.186
I have that
on the highest authority.

01:40:41.523 --> 01:40:42.522
Now if you don't mind,

01:40:42.524 --> 01:40:45.691
I need to be alone
with my patient.

01:41:08.415 --> 01:41:11.682
So how do you feel?

01:41:14.119 --> 01:41:16.551
Fine.

01:41:20.123 --> 01:41:23.290
Wait a minute.

01:41:23.292 --> 01:41:25.225
How?

01:41:25.226 --> 01:41:27.159
An answer
to an angel's prayer.

01:41:30.597 --> 01:41:33.264
Do you like it?

01:41:33.266 --> 01:41:35.532
Look at that.

01:41:36.001 --> 01:41:38.334
I got a leave of
absence for good
behavior.

01:41:38.336 --> 01:41:42.171
I guess he thought
we could make some
good music together.

01:41:42.173 --> 01:41:45.007
Jim, I'm starving.

01:41:45.009 --> 01:41:50.078
Do you feel well
enough to take me out
for some French fries?

01:41:56.485 --> 01:41:58.685
¶ When I'm with you ¶

01:41:58.687 --> 01:42:01.020
¶ I come alive ¶

01:42:01.022 --> 01:42:05.224
¶ I feel I'm living
in heaven ¶

01:42:05.226 --> 01:42:07.259
¶ you make the wrong ¶

01:42:07.261 --> 01:42:09.561
¶ turn out so right ¶

01:42:09.563 --> 01:42:14.165
¶ I'm gonna love you forever ¶

01:42:14.167 --> 01:42:17.568
¶ in your arms
you made me warm ¶

01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:22.706
¶ you give me strength
to carry on ¶

01:42:22.708 --> 01:42:25.775
¶ I know I won't
be alone ¶

01:42:25.777 --> 01:42:33.115
¶ as long as I'm with you ¶

01:42:40.157 --> 01:42:42.357
[new song begins]

01:42:48.264 --> 01:42:54.067
¶ When there's a dark storm
on your horizon ¶

01:42:54.069 --> 01:42:59.204
¶ and you think
you can't get through it ¶

01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:04.175
¶ just put your hand
in my hand ¶

01:43:04.177 --> 01:43:09.246
¶ and I'll show you
how to do it ¶

01:43:09.248 --> 01:43:14.383
¶ when the future
looks uncertain ¶

01:43:14.385 --> 01:43:18.653
¶ you can count on me
to be there ¶

01:43:18.655 --> 01:43:24.325
¶ when your heart and soul
are hurting ¶

01:43:24.327 --> 01:43:28.329
¶ just look
and you'll see me there ¶

01:43:28.331 --> 01:43:33.266
¶ just follow where I lead ¶

01:43:33.268 --> 01:43:37.870
¶ I'll give you what you need ¶

01:43:37.872 --> 01:43:41.874
¶ a love that's always true ¶

01:43:41.876 --> 01:43:48.246
¶ and someone who
believes in you ¶

01:43:49.682 --> 01:43:51.882
¶ it's time to come alive ¶

01:43:51.884 --> 01:43:54.718
¶ your moment has arrived ¶

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:59.855
¶ I'll bring out
the best in you ¶

01:43:59.857 --> 01:44:01.990
¶ we can have it all ¶

01:44:01.992 --> 01:44:03.858
¶ no, we will never fall ¶

01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:13.767
¶ looking down from
our celestial view ¶

01:44:33.488 --> 01:44:38.423
¶ just follow where I lead ¶

01:44:38.425 --> 01:44:42.560
¶ I'll give you what you need ¶

01:44:42.562 --> 01:44:48.799
¶ and I'll tell you
something else ¶

01:44:48.801 --> 01:44:52.969
¶ you'll start believing
in yourself ¶

01:44:52.971 --> 01:44:56.038
¶ it's an easy
thing to do ¶

01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:08.316
¶ and you've got someone
who believes in you ¶
