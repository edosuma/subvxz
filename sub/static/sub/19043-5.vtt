Dale, I'm sorry,
but I don't think
I can go out with you again.

09:29.994 --> 09:31.927
Plus I rubbed my feet on
everything that you own,

09:31.929 --> 09:34.362
So everything that
you own smells like feet.

09:34.364 --> 09:37.264
- I also farted on your socks.
- Did you?

09:37.266 --> 09:39.099
I farted on your dirty socks,

09:39.101 --> 09:41.167
So your dirty socks smell
like dirty socks and farts.

09:41.169 --> 09:42.601

- Thank you.

emergency.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.446

Apologize to the state
of california.

10:39.149 --> 10:42.216
Okay! Go back into

10:42.218 --> 10:43.884

if you go have lunch.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.841
You guys don't care,
do you?

12:40.843 --> 12:42.809
See? They don't care.

12:42.811 --> 12:44.010

12:51.585 --> 12:54.852
You know that song,
"girls gotta have fun"?

12:54.854 --> 12:57.254
Uh. "girls just
wanna have fun"?

12:57.256 --> 12:59.356
Yeah, that was it.

12:59.358 --> 13:01.925
- Okay.
- Yay! Come on!

13:01.927 --> 13:03.626
Okay, great.
Let me get my stuff.

13:07.765 --> 13:10.098
This remind you of childhood?
Chasing you around a table,

13:10.100 --> 13:11.699
'cause you always
screw thing up?

13:11.701 --> 13:13.600
Martha was gonna be
my girlfriend

13:13.602 --> 13:14.667
Until you came along.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.502
Dale, she was my friend first.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.204
- Martha's a woman that needs.
- No, she's not.

13:19.206 --> 13:21.506
Oh, yes, she is.

13:21.508 --> 13:23.441
Because when we were doing
the old in-and-out,

13:23.443 --> 13:25.910
She loved it.

13:25.912 --> 13:28.679
I also had sex with
your little frenchie wife.

13:28.681 --> 13:30.213
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

13:30.215 --> 13:32.348
I pretended to be you
and had sex with her.

13:32.350 --> 13:35.451
Now I know you're lying.
She would never have sex
with me.

13:35.453 --> 13:39.855
Well, that's just sad, chip.

13:39.857 --> 13:41.590
Yeah, I know.

13:41.592 --> 13:42.657
That's really sad.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.367
Well, I had sex
with your wife, nicole.

13:54.369 --> 13:55.468
What do you think
about that?

13:59.873 --> 14:02.407
You had sex...

14:02.409 --> 14:04.242
With nicole?

14:04.244 --> 14:05.643
No, obviously that's not true.
I just--

14:05.645 --> 14:08.278
You like to joke around,
do you?

14:13.249 --> 14:15.149
How could you do this to me?

14:16.651 --> 14:18.284
My life is not
some kind of joke!

14:18.286 --> 14:20.619
- Dale!
- Not a joke!

14:20.621 --> 14:21.753
Dale! Dale!

14:24.924 --> 14:26.522
You're dislodging the toilet!

14:32.661 --> 14:34.061
Shit water!

14:35.063 --> 14:37.864
Oh, my god!
God damn it!

14:39.099 --> 14:44.102
Martha, can you keep
a secret?

14:44.104 --> 14:46.804
Um, no, I'm actually
a bit of a snitch.

14:46.806 --> 14:49.807
Who cares?
I met someone.

14:49.809 --> 14:53.643
- You have a boyfriend?
- Oh, no, nothing like that.

14:53.645 --> 14:55.678
But there was a vibe.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.479
What kind of vibe?

14:57.481 --> 14:59.514
Well, went to
the ronald reagan library,

14:59.516 --> 15:02.083
And he put his hand
on my back.

15:02.085 --> 15:03.984
- Wow.
- What?

15:03.986 --> 15:07.120
That usually means they
want to get naked with you.

15:07.122 --> 15:09.822
I'm so out of
the dating scene.

15:09.824 --> 15:11.423
I didn't know
that meant that.

15:11.425 --> 15:13.024
Well, I read a lot
of magazines,

15:13.026 --> 15:14.992
So I'm probably
more of an expert

15:14.994 --> 15:17.627
Than most people
who actually date.

15:17.629 --> 15:20.363
You know, martha,

15:20.365 --> 15:22.932
You make everything
very clear to me.

15:22.934 --> 15:26.035
Come around more often.
I miss you.

15:26.037 --> 15:28.103
I don't think
that's a good idea.

15:28.105 --> 15:29.637
I think chip's mad
at me.

15:29.639 --> 15:31.772
Oh, you don't worry
about chip.

15:31.774 --> 15:35.275
When a boy is mean to a girl,
it means he likes her.

15:35.277 --> 15:38.711
Um, mrs. Baskets,
it's really not like that.

15:38.713 --> 15:42.748
Okay, martha.
Keep your little secrets.
I don't care.

15:47.788 --> 15:51.889
Threw my whole life away to go
see a pixar movie with martha!

15:51.891 --> 15:53.490
Dale! God!

15:53.492 --> 15:56.326
Yes, sir. I'm having
a toilet emergency.

15:56.328 --> 15:59.362
- If there's anybody there--
- little dale.

15:59.364 --> 16:02.031
- Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
- Hey, little dale.

16:02.033 --> 16:04.400
I failed you, little dale.

16:04.402 --> 16:08.270
Dale?
Again, I'm sorry. Okay?

16:13.542 --> 16:17.678
Big dale, you're an idiot.
A goddamn idiot!

16:17.680 --> 16:19.713
Dale, don't be so hard
on your yourself.

16:19.715 --> 16:21.547
You shut up.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.752
super glue ain't
gonna fix that!

16:31.256 --> 16:34.592
I've ruined my family
just like dad ruined ours.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.661
It's okay, dale.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.263
- It's okay.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.467
- Kitty cat!
- Hey! Hey!

16:45.469 --> 16:48.002
- Kitty cat!

16:53.340 --> 16:56.008
Dale: Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

16:56.010 --> 16:58.777
Look up in the trees.

16:58.779 --> 17:02.046
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty!

17:03.182 --> 17:04.881
Which one was it.
Anyway?

17:04.883 --> 17:06.949
- Uh, ronald reagan.
- Ronald reagan. Good gosh.

17:06.951 --> 17:08.517
What did you do
with the other one?

17:08.519 --> 17:10.986
I put will ferrell
in cody and logan's room.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.889
Well, I hope the cat
just takes a pee-pee
all over their room.

17:14.891 --> 17:18.359
Speaking of which,
mom is gonna be pissed.

17:18.361 --> 17:20.728
You know, like when dad
was in one of his moods?

17:20.730 --> 17:22.362
That kind of pissed.

17:22.364 --> 17:25.164
We'll find the cat,
okay, dale?

17:25.166 --> 17:28.066
Kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty.

17:28.068 --> 17:32.036
Hey, why don't we talk
about dad. You know--

17:32.038 --> 17:34.171
Oh, my god!
What is that gonna do?

17:34.173 --> 17:36.873
That's a giant waste of time.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.742
I just think that
we should maybe start
talking about him a bit.

17:39.744 --> 17:44.079
Ronald reagan!
Ronald reagan!

17:44.081 --> 17:45.547
Ronald reagan!

17:47.050 --> 17:50.184
Oh, my card's back. Good.

17:50.186 --> 17:52.886
Oh, well, thank you
for the hot dog.

17:52.888 --> 17:54.687
Oh, martha, it was $1.50.

17:54.689 --> 17:57.189
Thank <i>you</i> for spending
time with me.

17:57.191 --> 17:59.357
Well, I like spending time
with you.

17:59.359 --> 18:00.991
- You do?
- Yeah.

18:00.993 --> 18:02.525
Why?

18:02.527 --> 18:05.561
Well, for one thing, you
always have something to say.

18:05.563 --> 18:07.763
- I do, don't I?
- Yeah.

18:07.765 --> 18:11.566
Oh, martha, I like you
a whole lot more than
I like that penelope.

18:11.568 --> 18:13.167
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

18:13.169 --> 18:14.835
You get along
with your parents.

18:14.837 --> 18:17.838
You're a smart dresser.
You work at costco.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.240
You're the complete package,
martha.

18:20.242 --> 18:22.575
And don't let anyone
tell you any different.

18:22.577 --> 18:24.777
- Um, well I--
- bye!

18:24.779 --> 18:26.578
...Probably will.

18:27.746 --> 18:29.613
Ronald reagan!

18:29.615 --> 18:32.182
Hey, pull over there.
Right there,
just for a second.

18:42.692 --> 18:44.826
Well, I don't think we're
gonna find the cat out here.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.434
You ever come
out to this spot?

18:54.436 --> 18:56.335
Can't say that I have.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.441
Yeah, dad just accidentally
fell off the bridge

19:04.443 --> 19:07.544
Whilst he was admiring
the river's beauty.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.879
Nice try, mom.

19:09.881 --> 19:11.580
I believed it.

19:11.582 --> 19:13.181
Well, you're dumber
than you look.

19:17.318 --> 19:19.319
It's okay to be angry.

19:19.321 --> 19:20.586
I'm not angry!

19:20.588 --> 19:22.154
I'm not angry,
I'm just full of beans.

19:22.156 --> 19:23.221
I've always been full
of beans.

19:23.223 --> 19:24.422
So many goddamn beans.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.056
I don't even--

19:38.934 --> 19:41.669
I might be
a little angry, okay?

19:41.671 --> 19:46.073
But you'd be angry, too,
if you were living
in the real world.

19:46.075 --> 19:49.076
You know, you're out, you know,
believing in fairy tales

19:49.078 --> 19:50.777
And spreading
your emotional diarrhea

19:50.779 --> 19:52.578
All over this great country
of ours,

19:52.580 --> 19:54.246
While I'm doing business.

19:54.248 --> 19:57.349
Real life stuff!
I'm running errands.

19:57.351 --> 19:59.818
I'm getting gasoline.
I'm going to the store.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.486
I'm buying mom flip-flops

20:01.488 --> 20:03.921
When I have to go
buy her flip-flops.

20:06.525 --> 20:07.924
I mean,
what are you thinking,

20:07.926 --> 20:10.293
Jumping on trains
like bob dylan or something?

20:10.295 --> 20:13.895
Those choo-choos can be really,
really dangerous.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.332
- It was stupid, dale.
- Yeah, it was stupid.

20:18.334 --> 20:22.669
It's just dangerous.
It makes me nervous.
It makes me upset!

20:24.138 --> 20:25.404
You're my only brother.

20:27.106 --> 20:28.573
Except those other ones.

20:31.944 --> 20:34.211
It was a mistake.

20:35.781 --> 20:37.313
- There's that little pussy.
- Okay.

20:37.315 --> 20:40.182
Okay, let's go.
Ronald reagan!

20:40.184 --> 20:43.051
- Ronald reagan!
- Ronald reagan!

20:43.053 --> 20:45.720
- Ronald reagan!
- Ronald reagan!

20:45.722 --> 20:48.222
- Ronald reagan!
- Ronald reagan!

20:48.224 --> 20:50.190
- Ronald reagan!
- Ronald reagan!

20:50.192 --> 20:52.392
Ronald reagan!
He likes my voice better.

20:52.394 --> 20:54.227
What are you doing?
Don't-- hey.

20:54.229 --> 20:57.129
Hey. Ronald reagan.

20:57.131 --> 21:00.065
Ronald reagan!
Don't jump.

21:00.067 --> 21:02.801
The cat almost did
what daddy did.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.803
Ronald reagan!

21:04.805 --> 21:07.472
ronald reagan!

21:07.474 --> 21:11.008
- Oh, I've got an idea.
- What?

21:11.010 --> 21:12.976
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

21:23.353 --> 21:25.052
Don't open a fresh can
of balls

21:25.054 --> 21:27.154
Unless you plan on doing
something with it.

21:27.156 --> 21:30.023
He's not gonna eat tennis balls.
That's for dogs.

21:30.025 --> 21:32.557
Dogs like tennis balls.
Cats don't like--

21:34.159 --> 21:37.594
Look at that.
Great job.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.936
You've been a naughty boy,
ronald reagan.

21:46.938 --> 21:48.604
Just like the guy
he's named after.

21:51.041 --> 21:52.840
Good job, dale.

21:52.842 --> 21:55.776
Nice work
yourself, chip.

21:55.778 --> 21:58.512
Nice work,
ronald reagan.

21:58.514 --> 22:00.347
Hey, ronald.

22:00.349 --> 22:01.981
He's bossy.

22:11.724 --> 22:14.092
I'm home.

22:20.933 --> 22:23.500
Hey! We found the cat!
